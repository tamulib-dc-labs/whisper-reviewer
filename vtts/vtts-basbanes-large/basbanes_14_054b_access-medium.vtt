00:02.495 --> 00:08.342
And they had a woman who was teaching, uh, Bavish languages.

00:08.362 --> 00:17.073
And I had a kind of lucifilia at that time, a few literature, just discovered, you know, Dostoevsky, people like that.

00:17.093 --> 00:20.177
And, uh, so I took her Russian language case.

00:20.297 --> 00:22.119
And, just for fun.

00:22.139 --> 00:25.043
Then I transferred to Indiana.

00:25.310 --> 00:29.416
I sort of got involved in just running everything.

00:29.476 --> 00:36.265
I was class president, newspaper editor, student council, all kinds of stuff.

00:36.465 --> 00:38.028
Was that you at Bloomington?

00:38.648 --> 00:40.571
No, this was at Southern Illinois first.

00:40.591 --> 00:42.414
I've been doing all that stuff.

00:42.694 --> 00:47.621
No, I transferred for the reason I had to get rid of it.

00:47.641 --> 00:51.486
I was doing that instead of anything else.

00:51.668 --> 01:05.428
So I went to Indiana just to be a student, and it wasn't a good place for that, rather dismal.

01:05.528 --> 01:08.933
I ended up almost not graduating, but I went ahead.

01:09.774 --> 01:14.761
I was a journalism major, and I hated the journalism department.

01:14.901 --> 01:17.625
They ended up kind of hating me.

01:18.247 --> 01:26.462
And so I ended up in my senior year facing the same problem you had about deferment, without a degree coming in hand.

01:26.542 --> 01:36.621
I had no major, and had all the coursework and grades, but I'd just been taking courses all over the landscape.

01:36.721 --> 01:38.164
I had nothing that added up to anything.

01:38.685 --> 01:39.867
I had no advisor.

01:40.150 --> 01:41.833
I was really abreast.

01:41.973 --> 01:51.591
Pinch on G. Allen, of course, is his Pinch on disciple.

01:51.652 --> 01:58.885
Well, G. was, because it's all about that 56 period.

01:59.978 --> 02:03.245
I loved the book anyhow, and it was funny.

02:03.606 --> 02:14.629
It kind of gave a jump start to my own sense of humor, which had been flagging in the course of trying to battle my way through that book.

02:15.217 --> 02:20.905
So I've been grateful to him, but partly it had to do with the fact that that period was so coincided.

02:21.405 --> 02:26.772
He was just a sailor, but he was in the same area.

02:26.892 --> 02:32.240
When did you make the transition from journalist to fiction editor?

02:32.260 --> 02:33.762
Well, almost immediately.

02:33.842 --> 02:36.385
I never really was an enthusiastic journalist.

02:36.405 --> 02:38.448
My dad had the newspaper.

02:38.528 --> 02:41.612
What was the name of the newspaper?

02:41.930 --> 02:43.692
I forget the Bedford's paper.

02:43.772 --> 02:45.834
The one that I work for is the Heron Daily Journal.

02:46.335 --> 02:55.744
And then it was bought up by a guy in Decatur who had some interesting ideas which really wrecked my father's life.

02:56.805 --> 03:04.834
He decided to amalgamate three small town newspapers and create a metropolitan newspaper in a small town in southern Illinois.

03:04.854 --> 03:09.979
Carbondale, Murfreesboro and Heron were brought together and created the southern Illinois, which still exists.

03:10.955 --> 03:21.334
And each of the issues would be identical except for a page which each of the towns would have that would be wholly their own page.

03:21.855 --> 03:31.512
And then the duties were separated out so that one would be focused more on the forest side, one more on the physical production side, and one more on the advertising side.

03:32.150 --> 03:37.077
And my father's staff had gotten more of their kind of commercial stuff.

03:37.458 --> 03:47.673
In the end, he was very unhappy because the people locally didn't like it, and they blamed him for what happened to our old newspaper kind of thing.

03:47.953 --> 03:58.208
And he finally gave it off and left there and put the job out in Nebraska and didn't work out, and then he ended up getting into insurance.

03:58.441 --> 04:00.226
By that time, it separated from his.

04:00.266 --> 04:04.577
The journalistic experience I had led me to think that's what I was going to do.

04:04.617 --> 04:09.691
So at Southern Illinois, I was a journalism major.

04:10.613 --> 04:13.260
The first two years, you don't declare that much anyhow.

04:13.763 --> 04:22.061
It was mainly what I did, and I went to assistant editor-in-chief of the university, I suppose, when I left.

04:22.643 --> 04:29.157
So when I went to India, I went to the Journal of the Major, but I just hated everybody in the department, the teachers, everything.

04:29.137 --> 04:38.814
So within the first semester, I backed out of it, and as soon as I'd done that, I was done with it.

04:39.094 --> 04:42.199
I was already writing stories.

04:42.219 --> 04:46.707
I'd been writing stories since I was in high school.

04:47.513 --> 04:52.361
They weren't... I did the first serious writing after I left the nation.

04:52.381 --> 04:55.025
When I got out of it, I got out of it.

04:55.906 --> 05:02.236
By that time, I had encountered Costco, Rebecca, and all the writers that made a major impact on me.

05:02.296 --> 05:10.690
Gotten out of the New Yorker Saturday week post-notion of what fiction was, and was trying to find out more.

05:10.730 --> 05:12.913
So, the first very earliest...

05:12.893 --> 05:16.762
And a breakaway picture from 57.

05:18.586 --> 05:24.460
Well, I know you... My wife's waiting for 7 o'clock.

05:24.480 --> 05:26.886
Well, you're late.
