WEBVTT

00:02.174 --> 00:06.279
We're talking to Paul Needham.

00:06.299 --> 00:11.405
And don't worry about, you know, if you're beating or just ask me to shut you off or something.

00:11.465 --> 00:24.721
I guess where you have worn, to use the cliche, two hats, and I wonder, is there, do you get two perspectives, having been at the Borgin and now being at Sotheby's?

00:24.741 --> 00:26.443
And maybe there's a follow-up question.

00:28.786 --> 00:56.380
Well, I mean, it still is dealing with the same book world from somewhat different angles, but using many of the same processes of thinking about books, but applying them to different purposes towards thinking about acquiring something versus thinking about at least, well, not directly selling it, but presenting it.

00:59.819 --> 01:03.284
More than that, they don't seem radically different.

01:03.364 --> 01:10.474
You were more concerned, I guess, with acquiring and maintaining a collection.

01:11.416 --> 01:21.610
Here, the emphasis is on, I guess, getting books that you can offer to other collectors to sell, I guess.

01:21.830 --> 01:25.135
That does require a leap, I guess, of philosophy in your mind.

01:25.807 --> 01:53.569
Well, yeah, the Morgan Library has traditionally collected over pretty wide areas, but it's certainly true that since getting to Sotheby's, one has to pay serious attention to some degree with really anything, anything within the Books and Manuscripts rubric that has considerable market value.

01:54.342 --> 02:11.907
So it doesn't depend nearly so much on one's personal opinions and reactions as would develop in a library where certain areas simply have a focus, have a greater interest for oneself.

02:11.927 --> 02:17.514
And in the auction world, that would be an indefensible luxury.

02:17.534 --> 02:20.198
There would be no point to it, really.

02:20.418 --> 02:22.982
Did you feel that it was time for a change, say?

02:26.573 --> 02:28.015
I did.

02:28.035 --> 02:30.618
I suppose I did by definition in some way.

02:31.098 --> 02:44.454
Just to see the same world from a different viewpoint did sound quite interesting.

02:44.474 --> 02:48.739
How do you feel about, in fact, the Shoyan, is that how you pronounce it?

02:48.759 --> 02:48.899
Shoyan.

02:48.919 --> 02:49.179
Shoyan, yeah.

02:49.199 --> 02:49.680
Now, are they Americans?

02:49.700 --> 02:50.761
Because there is no biographical description of them.

02:50.781 --> 02:55.146
No, he's a Norwegian collector and a continuing, very

02:55.987 --> 03:02.876
devoted collector, but not of printed materials, rather of essentially medieval manuscript materials.

03:02.896 --> 03:08.584
And so the Incarnibles of Morellas came in as a consequence of collecting the other stuff.

03:08.644 --> 03:15.253
Yes, as a sort of adventure in a related form of book.

03:15.273 --> 03:23.665
And I suppose the bug for that didn't bite nearly as strongly as his bug for medieval manuscripts.

03:25.467 --> 03:27.710
Now, this is a Norwegian collection?

03:27.730 --> 03:29.732
Yeah.

03:29.752 --> 03:33.417
That statement that prefaces the catalog, it's not signed.

03:33.797 --> 03:35.499
Are we to assume that that is his statement?

03:35.519 --> 03:37.381
That is his statement, that's right.

03:37.401 --> 03:45.571
Yeah, and in fact, I mean, although it's very brief, I think it expresses his personality rather strongly.

03:45.591 --> 03:46.492
I've already quoted it.

03:50.237 --> 03:52.740
When Robert Ho saw his great collection,

03:53.615 --> 03:57.321
I mean, it could really be argued that that should have been institutionalized.

03:58.703 --> 04:03.410
But he said, if it hadn't been for other collectors, where would I have found my books?

04:03.730 --> 04:08.538
And Skoyan basically says the same thing.

04:08.558 --> 04:21.377
I would much rather give the next generation of collectors the thrill of the chase, the excitement of the discovery, and it's just a very resonant statement from the host.

04:25.120 --> 04:38.412
How do you feel?

04:38.432 --> 04:39.033
Do you have two minds on this?

04:39.053 --> 04:42.201
They really should be institutionalized.

04:43.058 --> 05:11.445
I think either decision is perfectly defensible, because after all these are

05:13.417 --> 05:14.458
private collections.

05:15.159 --> 05:29.012
And if there weren't, from the collector's point, that freedom of decision to do what he or she wants to do, where would the impetus for collecting them come from in the first place?

05:30.814 --> 05:43.086
There may be some institutions that have an institutional passion for collecting, like the Morgan Library, traditionally, or the Houghton Library.

05:43.420 --> 05:55.373
After all, there are lots of other institutions that don't have that kind of a passion, and it takes some serious interest like that to form any really important collection.

05:56.194 --> 06:11.571
So I think it's to be encouraged, and if the result of that is many collections being dispersed again eventually, I don't think that's in itself a bad thing.

06:12.226 --> 06:23.797
I think it's a bad thing only if important materials become truly lost, that is, end up in hands where they get forgotten to an extent that they can disappear entirely.

06:24.358 --> 06:35.769
But if they go from one person who knows what they are and pays attention to them to another who feels the same way, I don't think they really are lost.

06:35.789 --> 06:39.453
Do you think they're even temporarily unavailable for consultation?

06:39.533 --> 06:41.895
Well, it's not a question of being lost.

06:44.525 --> 07:04.877
in the ornithological books, which were said to be extraordinary and probably better than most institutional collections, if not all, that you would never have another opportunity to get as a collection of this body of material.

07:04.897 --> 07:07.161
And it may be, I'll just throw this out as an example.

07:07.181 --> 07:10.887
I mean, there were, even at the Grosier Club, for instance, a few people who wondered why it

07:11.069 --> 07:14.674
But of course, if Martin had wanted to do that, he would have done it, right?

07:14.694 --> 07:20.923
He lived a long life, and so he had many decades in which he could have made that decision if he wanted to.

07:20.943 --> 07:28.013
I don't think there's any alternative to letting the collector make up his or her own mind.

07:28.714 --> 07:29.435
You don't think there's any?

07:29.515 --> 07:37.667
No, I think any alternative would tend towards killing off collecting at all.

07:38.407 --> 07:39.368
Of course, look at Brinley.

07:39.388 --> 07:42.952
I mean, Brinley decided that the material should be sold.

07:43.732 --> 07:45.054
But he also gave incentives.

07:45.574 --> 07:52.782
So he gave something like $50,000, which was a lot of money.

07:52.802 --> 07:56.666
I don't know what the figure was, more or less.

07:56.686 --> 07:57.747
But he gave $10,000 to Yale.

07:57.767 --> 07:59.709
AAS got some.

07:59.729 --> 08:01.470
New York, I think, public library got some.

08:01.490 --> 08:03.412
Yeah, Thomas Streeter did the same.

08:03.432 --> 08:04.954
Yeah, Streeter followed that example.

08:05.913 --> 08:08.616
...credits towards what you might like to buy at price sale.

08:08.636 --> 08:11.299
Yeah, well that's a very classy gesture.

08:11.419 --> 08:13.321
That was kind of a nice way to do things.

08:13.341 --> 08:15.163
That really is.

08:16.805 --> 08:22.932
I guess there are various... Do you still get excited by that wonderful book?

08:22.952 --> 08:28.678
Is there something emotional that... Compared to what?

08:28.698 --> 08:30.780
Well, I mean, what's the alternative?

08:30.840 --> 08:33.203
I mean, we all do work.

08:34.094 --> 08:49.728
And as I say, it's a job, but you must feel something when you find a book at the Library of Congress.

08:49.748 --> 08:50.548
Tell me that story.

08:50.628 --> 08:58.155
Peter mentioned that you were there just to look at the book, and all of a sudden you said, wait a minute, it looks like Caxton type.

08:59.196 --> 09:00.157
That's a heck of a story.

09:00.257 --> 09:04.000
Well, yeah, I mean, I guess that's about right, yeah.

09:04.773 --> 09:06.756
The little strips were sewn into the book.

09:06.836 --> 09:16.389
And so ordinarily, if you're looking at the book as a book, you have no particular reason to be paying attention to the sewing guards.

09:16.890 --> 09:30.949
And I guess it was almost by chance that after finishing what I wanted to see in the books, I took just another moment or two to look at these to see what they are.

09:31.638 --> 09:52.339
Really for me, because the binding was probably 1530s, about 40 years after Caxton's death, my first thought was that it was printing from that period, which wouldn't be nearly so interesting by all probability.

09:53.360 --> 10:01.088
So it took me a while to get my thinking straight and just try to identify the type.

10:01.591 --> 10:05.075
I guess I found that I could, and then I got much more interested.

10:05.095 --> 10:18.108
Yeah, but then the research that you did, in fact, I brought the book, and I'm going to ask you to describe it as well, but just to find out the organization, I mean, that was involved.

10:18.128 --> 10:22.132
I mean, that must have been an exciting... Yeah, well, sure.

10:22.152 --> 10:28.138
I mean, everything that's printed is printed for a reason, and usually the reason isn't

10:29.384 --> 10:31.607
directly advertised in the book.

10:31.668 --> 10:40.982
So what you want to do is try to figure out what situation occurred in the 15th century in this instance that brought that book into existence.

10:43.666 --> 10:50.076
Sometimes that's a very complicated and rather interesting question.

10:50.096 --> 10:53.682
I'm going to jump, just absolutely jump from there to something else.

10:55.385 --> 10:56.286
At the height of the

10:56.857 --> 11:15.060
just prior to the Garden Sale, following the Doheny Sale, as the Martin Sale was underway, and I had talked to David Redden a couple of times, and he had said then that he felt that we were in the middle of another golden age, a book collecting, a golden age, and I suppose we have two libraries.

11:15.120 --> 11:20.046
I mean, obviously it's not a golden age.

11:20.819 --> 11:36.925
like the one where Mr. Hunter and Mr. Morgan were able to buy extraordinary libraries on block, one after the other, and the prices were... But his point was that I think material that people never thought would be made available again all of a sudden was on the market.

11:36.945 --> 11:38.007
I asked Eddie Wolfe that.

11:38.247 --> 11:42.895
He said, well, he said, could somebody go out and get a set of Shakespeare quarters?

11:43.533 --> 11:46.096
I'm going to know.

11:46.317 --> 11:51.022
He said, we can't even get a full run of poor Richard's Almanacs here at the library company, which they don't have.

11:52.304 --> 11:58.372
He said, to me, a golden age is not only big prices at interest, but accessibility and availability.

11:58.452 --> 12:03.759
And so he made that qualification.

12:03.779 --> 12:08.865
But I just want to know, do you think the 80s were a pretty interesting time, nonetheless, for a book collecting?

12:11.731 --> 12:13.313
I think it was a pretty interesting time.

12:13.353 --> 12:16.336
I'm not sure that it was a golden age.

12:16.596 --> 12:24.364
But I think that compared to, I would.

12:24.704 --> 12:37.196
Yeah, just a little bit.

12:37.216 --> 12:40.600
That's fine.

12:40.620 --> 12:40.860
Yes, please.

12:41.600 --> 12:43.943
I've never seen green mussels before.

12:43.963 --> 12:44.944
They're pretty.

12:45.905 --> 13:03.905
I would have thought that people like Morgan and Huntington at their height were spending what in today's terms would be tens of millions of dollars, rather than millions of dollars annually on books.

13:04.265 --> 13:08.110
And I'm not sure they're collectors today.

13:09.131 --> 13:10.172
Nothing for me, no, that's fine.

13:10.540 --> 13:25.522
I'm not sure there are collectors today who are as ambitious as Huntington and Morgan and Fulcher were.

13:25.542 --> 13:38.742
And it seems to me that maybe if there were a collector too who had that kind of money or were willing to spend that kind of money, you might find that entire collections would become available to them again.

13:39.042 --> 13:43.408
Were you able, and how long were you at the Morgan?

13:43.428 --> 13:44.910
At some point, I might like a little biograph.

13:44.930 --> 13:46.572
Do you have a biograph?

13:46.592 --> 13:46.993
Yes, we do.

13:47.794 --> 13:53.201
Then I won't go through the, I won't ask you to go through the, if Matthew can give me something.

13:53.221 --> 13:56.024
I was there 18 some years, you know.

13:56.044 --> 13:58.067
Did you get a sense of Mr. Morgan as a collector?

13:58.988 --> 14:02.293
The first, the first Mr. Morgan.

14:02.333 --> 14:07.800
Some sense of him as a collector, though I, I mean, I still must say, I don't, I don't feel that I,

14:08.573 --> 14:12.056
that I know Pierpont Morgan very well.

14:12.257 --> 14:16.020
One still is waiting for a really good biography of him, I think.

14:17.922 --> 14:20.825
I think Gene Strauss is working on it.

14:20.845 --> 14:22.246
Yeah, which will be good.

14:22.827 --> 14:28.893
Of course, he was not just a book collector.

14:28.953 --> 14:36.420
Much more of his money, in fact, went into art collecting and book collecting.

14:38.037 --> 14:39.498
Yeah, but he kept the books, didn't he?

14:41.340 --> 14:45.244
He kept the books, or his son made sure that the books were kept.

14:45.264 --> 14:46.565
His son's really a hero in this.

14:46.625 --> 14:47.606
Yeah, I think he is.

14:52.671 --> 14:59.638
Yeah, very unassuming and very public-spirited about the collection, making it available, turning it into a working library.

14:59.658 --> 15:01.460
There are wonderful letters at Harvard.

15:02.841 --> 15:07.065
Do you have a sense of people, of collecting as a

15:07.484 --> 15:09.167
as a passion, as a mania?

15:09.187 --> 15:15.636
Do you have us think about the people who acquire these things?

15:17.479 --> 15:18.280
Are you more concerned?

15:18.300 --> 15:20.223
I think about the books more.

15:20.243 --> 15:26.252
That's a valid answer.

15:26.513 --> 15:31.740
I think the closest comparison for book collectors is collectors of other objects.

15:34.384 --> 15:35.466
I suppose the point about

15:37.235 --> 15:40.278
Book collectors, it's a mystery to people who aren't collectors.

15:40.298 --> 15:52.949
What they don't quite grasp is that it is a love of objects rather than of the idea of reading.

15:55.131 --> 16:00.215
And there's nothing unrespectable about loving objects.

16:00.235 --> 16:06.921
It's just that in most people's minds, that's perfectly fine if it's a print or a painting, but it simply doesn't occur to them

16:07.694 --> 16:14.303
that a book is an artifact, too, made by people and reflecting lots of different people's efforts.

16:14.643 --> 16:30.804
And there are perfectly valid reasons why one wants to own a Shakespeare first folio rather than a set of 37 Penguin paperbacks or Pelican paperbacks.

16:30.824 --> 16:35.170
I really just think it's a failure of imagination on the part of the people who aren't collectors that it's.

16:36.972 --> 16:37.633
Do you collect?

16:38.052 --> 16:51.832
I own a lot of books and buy a lot of books, but it isn't collecting in the sense of any of the people that you've mentioned.

16:51.872 --> 16:54.115
I mean, of course, many books, but yes.

16:54.215 --> 16:56.218
I wouldn't bet anything that you love books that you love.

16:56.499 --> 16:56.979
Oh, yes.

16:57.140 --> 17:07.755
I mean, yeah, I certainly still react strongly to books, but I'm not nearly as inquisitive, except in a few areas of certain kinds of

17:08.545 --> 17:13.972
scholarship, original editions of it.

17:14.012 --> 17:20.740
How did you become, how did you choose a life among books?

17:20.760 --> 17:24.985
And this is not to conflict with your, you know, your recipes.

17:25.005 --> 17:28.489
I'm just curious about your, how you got into this.

17:28.509 --> 17:32.754
I just, I guess I found when I was... I mean, did you think you'd be a teacher at some point?

17:32.774 --> 17:36.799
Yeah, I thought I would be a college university teacher.

17:36.859 --> 17:38.181
Teaching what?

17:38.566 --> 18:00.027
teaching history, and at some point while working on my dissertation, I guess a year I spent, almost two years, I spent in London working on my dissertation, I found that I enjoyed handling the books and the documents and so forth.

18:00.888 --> 18:02.690
I'm sorry, I missed it.

18:02.710 --> 18:03.550
You said in London?

18:03.570 --> 18:06.193
Yeah, much more than

18:06.848 --> 18:16.021
the idea of being a teacher became much less important than the idea of continuing to handle objects, to be able to think about them as objects.

18:16.222 --> 18:22.090
Tell me what happens when you handle a wonderful object.

18:22.150 --> 18:29.100
Well, I suppose it is, although it's not necessarily handling a wonderful object.

18:29.160 --> 18:35.910
It's just that to understand any object, the real thing is...

18:36.717 --> 18:54.000
much more important than a reproduction of it, or a Xerox of it, or a picture of it, or whatever the case may be, that some kinds of knowledge you can only get by studying original objects and can't come by any other channel.

18:54.501 --> 18:59.367
And that's the part that I like.

19:05.270 --> 19:19.559
So did you ever teach, or did you actually go straight into it?

19:19.579 --> 19:20.341
No, still I go on.

19:20.461 --> 19:26.333
In fact, I went to the Morgan Library for a year before coming to the Morgan Library.

19:46.580 --> 20:09.668
half a million dollars for a baseball card I mean all those I don't think there's anything everything is really once it's on the market at all it's a supply and demand situation and you know I don't see any particular reason why it's scandalous if one kind of object

20:12.601 --> 20:15.485
brings a lot of money and yet sounds like an ephemeral piece.

20:15.565 --> 20:21.552
After all, anything which is ephemeral tends to be rare, and particularly tends to be rare in really good condition.

20:22.273 --> 20:32.966
And it's certainly good for the world overall in the long run if people are trying to preserve those objects and preserve them in that condition.

20:33.066 --> 20:40.195
If you spent whatever, $55,000 for Batman, you're presumably going to work rather hard at keeping that

20:40.428 --> 20:43.191
But do you smile a little bit?

20:43.211 --> 20:45.053
It seems just that's the way things work.

20:46.996 --> 20:51.121
Now that you are working with Smith, what is your title now, actually?

20:51.181 --> 20:54.344
Director of the Book of Manuscript.

20:54.465 --> 21:05.878
Do you have a greater sense of the value, and I'm not talking about intrinsic value, but what something is worth now more so than...

21:06.010 --> 21:31.427
Well, at the Morgan I paid a lot of attention to prices, but in more restricted areas.

21:33.415 --> 21:56.503
a lot of following decisions of whether Sotheby's will try to get it for sale or not try to, and so on and so forth.

21:58.762 --> 22:02.147
Going over to the other side, so to speak.

22:02.267 --> 22:05.831
Nothing that's come to my attention.

22:08.355 --> 22:11.419
Did you feel that it was time for a career move?

22:11.439 --> 22:12.701
Yeah, I suppose that was it.

22:12.841 --> 22:16.285
You don't regret it at all?

22:16.486 --> 22:18.648
You don't miss the cloistered life of the scholar?

22:20.451 --> 22:23.895
Well, at the time it didn't seem that terribly cloistered.

22:23.916 --> 22:27.300
I mean, it was fairly busy, too.

22:28.225 --> 22:49.253
I suppose the one thing I... there is a certain feeling of satisfaction in acquiring something permanently for a collection, because then one has the idea of fitting in a piece, or continuing a process of building, and that one really doesn't have in an auction house.

22:49.273 --> 22:52.877
And that's the one, maybe, most specific thing.

22:52.898 --> 22:57.844
But I imagine if you do enjoy coming in contact with artifacts,

22:58.465 --> 23:07.415
that this does give you an opportunity to transcend the small world that you were in down on 36th of Madison.

23:08.836 --> 23:15.163
You might be invited, not invited, but you might be sent to look at a collection that nobody's ever heard of before.

23:15.183 --> 23:28.337
Yes, and that has happened, maybe not in the most legendary sense, but certainly one sees just a wide variety of properties that one wouldn't otherwise.

23:28.807 --> 23:34.997
I suppose it does build up some kind of a sense simply of what survives, where it is.

23:36.459 --> 23:43.089
Many of the odd accidents of survival are sometimes rather minor but still quite interesting pieces.

23:43.109 --> 23:53.025
You realize what a haphazard process it is until the books become marketed objects when you're

23:53.731 --> 24:02.586
setting a value on them and aiming them at a much narrower but knowledgeable audience of other collectors' libraries.

24:03.948 --> 24:11.320
I'd like to talk briefly about the Declaration of Independence, which was sold in June.

24:11.340 --> 24:20.295
Basically, there must be quite a responsibility when something comes in without a provenance, and it's really...

24:20.596 --> 24:22.237
the load is really on your shoulders.

24:22.318 --> 24:25.440
I mean, somebody spent two and a half million or something like that.

24:25.500 --> 24:27.662
And it's really your call, basically, isn't it?

24:27.682 --> 24:33.588
I mean, there were others, but what's going to happen with this item really kind of depends upon your expertise.

24:33.608 --> 24:35.009
And whether it's real or not.

24:35.029 --> 24:37.652
And your judgment as to whether or not it's real.

24:37.672 --> 24:40.434
Yeah, which is a very serious question.

24:40.454 --> 24:49.202
On the other hand, the Declaration was so obviously real.

24:49.503 --> 24:53.768
that there was never a point of it seeming like a problem.

24:53.788 --> 24:54.249
Explain that to me.

24:54.269 --> 24:55.150
How is it so obvious?

24:55.270 --> 24:57.653
I don't know quite how to explain it.

24:57.673 --> 25:05.882
But in that particular case, it really had to be the real thing.

25:06.963 --> 25:10.087
It's just there was no way that that could have been a forgery.

25:10.107 --> 25:11.469
It was almost a forgery, wasn't it?

25:11.489 --> 25:13.231
Yeah, it was in a wonderful condition.

25:13.271 --> 25:15.173
You could see

25:15.507 --> 25:18.491
You could examine the paper in the closest possible way.

25:18.551 --> 25:20.994
You could examine the printing, the printing impressions.

25:22.596 --> 25:39.618
Very often when objects are, when there's a real difficulty in examining forgery, well, I think it's much more often the case with autographed material than with printed material.

25:39.638 --> 25:45.025
And it's often autographed material that's under glass, that's been framed.

25:45.207 --> 25:55.921
And the way so many collectors want a Washington letter, a Lincoln letter, and it's framed up in maybe a picture of Washington and Lincoln beside it.

25:55.941 --> 26:04.452
Well, that's much more, the process then is much more like looking at a plate in a book than like looking at an original object.

26:04.472 --> 26:13.965
There have been cases where things have looked real under glass, and then one takes them out and can examine them closely, and then it becomes...

26:14.266 --> 26:16.772
of the parents that they're forage your voice.

26:17.173 --> 26:21.723
Of course, the question, and I've asked David about this too, and he gave me a quote.

26:21.744 --> 26:26.655
And again, the responsibility of the, let me just turn this tape on the other side.
