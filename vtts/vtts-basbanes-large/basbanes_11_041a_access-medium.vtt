WEBVTT

00:02.174 --> 00:05.418
We're talking for two years.

00:05.478 --> 00:22.820
And this, of course, is second-hand, but I understand whether he said, no, you are all too white, you are all too heterosexual, whereupon I understand that wonderful James Chafee said, how do you know?

00:26.865 --> 00:27.426
That's funny.

00:29.669 --> 00:30.510
That's funny.

00:30.693 --> 00:32.096
That's lovely.

00:32.156 --> 00:33.178
That's a funny line.

00:33.358 --> 00:36.965
Anyway... But you were fine to be on this committee.

00:36.986 --> 00:40.352
I just put the tape on after you... Well, yes.

00:40.372 --> 00:43.138
It was an advisory, a citizen's advisory committee.

00:43.178 --> 00:44.881
Yes, yes.

00:45.122 --> 00:51.334
And I felt I was very well credentialed, seeing as I...

00:51.888 --> 00:55.653
you know, had not graduated high school and had become a writer.

00:56.174 --> 01:04.205
And it says on my book, Jack, as you know, public libraries were her college, although I did have other kinds of colleges, too.

01:05.467 --> 01:17.645
And that I, and that my book silences some of the material in that.

01:17.885 --> 01:21.490
I read from the San Francisco Public Library.

01:22.398 --> 01:27.744
which, of course, was my major source.

01:28.445 --> 01:41.700
That chapter on literacy, for instance, where did you find out Sojourner Truth and Harriet Tubman, you know, couldn't read or come you and Dreiser?

01:41.980 --> 01:44.103
I read.

01:44.543 --> 01:47.526
Well, they had the books in the library.

01:47.767 --> 01:50.650
Then, of course, I must say that in 1980,

01:50.967 --> 02:10.321
62 when my life changed, and I had two years in Cambridge when I was at the old Radcliffe, now the Bunding Institute, and I had time in a way I'd never had before, and I had my own little place in this little yellow house where the first headquarters were.

02:10.401 --> 02:13.026
It was just a couple blocks from

02:13.765 --> 02:22.793
And not only Wiedner, there was Houghton that I had access to, and it was before the days they had all of that security.

02:24.615 --> 02:42.912
And this is rather beside the point, but I had the great joy of meeting Theodore Ward, who was the only person who could read Emily Dickinson's handwriting.

02:43.077 --> 03:12.763
She was the granddaughter of the Hollands, who were very close friends of Dickinson's and had a lot of the letters, and she never got credit while accepting a certain thanks at the time that the poems came out, which she had put in the life-telling order, but she did get credit when the letters came out, that is, she had a whole chapter on the, but it was still

03:13.132 --> 03:18.757
The Harvard professor was the editor of it, you know, instead of all the work Theodora did.

03:18.797 --> 03:27.986
But she brought me into the Emily Dickinson room, and after that I had carte blanche.

03:28.906 --> 03:32.970
And I would just come in and, you know, open the drawers and see.

03:32.990 --> 03:35.352
It was a period before all that security.

03:35.653 --> 03:39.616
Well, isn't that Dickinson stuff they have at Harvard unbelievable?

03:39.636 --> 03:41.518
The Keats material is...

03:41.785 --> 03:44.670
Well, I never got to the Keats material.

03:47.915 --> 03:59.212
But anyway, and then, too, BPL, Boston Public Library, was marvelous.

03:59.232 --> 04:04.741
And then I absolutely loved the Cambridge Public Library.

04:05.242 --> 04:09.088
And they have this wonderful Thomas Wentworth Higginson selection.

04:09.108 --> 04:09.328
Yes.

04:09.747 --> 04:23.947
And that was where I ran across the real Thomas Wentworth Higginson that most people now, they only know that he didn't instantly see to it that Emily Dickinson was published in there.

04:23.967 --> 04:26.751
Actually, he was, I think he spelt her.

04:26.771 --> 04:28.734
I think he was an impediment to her, I think.

04:29.054 --> 04:29.515
Oh, no.

04:29.975 --> 04:30.336
Oh, no.

04:30.436 --> 04:31.097
Not at all.

04:31.217 --> 04:32.158
Not at all.

04:32.218 --> 04:32.899
Not at all.

04:32.960 --> 04:34.742
He was her great encourager.

04:34.975 --> 04:40.082
The very fact that after his first letter to her, he wrote her immediately.

04:41.384 --> 04:51.118
He wrote her that second letter in which he gave a real tribute to her poetry, and he kept in touch with her all of his busy life.

04:51.539 --> 04:54.903
Listen, who would publish that kind of poetry at that time?

04:55.725 --> 05:03.075
I should show you Brian's Treasury of American Poetry.

05:03.494 --> 05:06.217
which was put out at about that time.

05:06.257 --> 05:14.324
She was her own kind of a person, but he appreciated her poetry.

05:14.725 --> 05:27.577
Don't forget that she wrote to him all of her life, and he wrote to her, and he wrote to her, and he was the person who was asked to come and give the eulogy for her.

05:28.277 --> 05:33.062
And he's the person who, as soon as he saw those letters,

05:33.548 --> 05:36.972
He said these have to be published, and was responsible for it.

05:37.092 --> 05:57.717
No, and you know, he was a great man in his time, because he was so well-known in so many respects in the first place, and I never even knew that it was he, because the earliest Atlantic, I don't know if you read my Afterward to Life in the Iron Mills,

05:58.608 --> 06:00.090
It's in silences.

06:00.110 --> 06:01.632
It's in silences.

06:02.072 --> 06:02.593
Uh-huh, yes.

06:03.073 --> 06:03.233
Uh-huh.

06:03.253 --> 06:05.917
Well, you remember there's a footnote there.

06:06.397 --> 06:08.199
By the way, it's one of the references.

06:08.219 --> 06:24.899
It's right after the... Well, it's one of the references to the public library here, because it tells how it was that I found out... Where is... Just a second.

06:24.919 --> 06:25.780
Let's just...

06:26.620 --> 06:30.644
But that's good.

06:30.724 --> 06:37.731
This is what I want to talk about, by the way, and who have been made by the books that they've read.

06:37.751 --> 06:47.101
Also, well, at that time, it was open stacks.

06:47.121 --> 06:50.524
Now, of course, certain stacks.

06:50.544 --> 06:51.845
So much is not open.

06:52.366 --> 06:54.268
But I used to be just amazed.

06:54.328 --> 06:55.429
Here were these...

06:55.679 --> 07:10.180
abolitionist-bound, skinny-bound volumes of one of their publications that had been put out in something like 1811, right on the shelves there.

07:10.581 --> 07:12.884
And I'd never seen a book that old.

07:13.686 --> 07:22.058
But... It's...

07:23.658 --> 07:52.129
I think it should be somewhere in here that I say about my problem in finding out who she was, because now I'm speaking about Rebecca Harding-David, and I found the reference to her in a letter from Emily Dickinson to Susan,

07:52.936 --> 08:01.284
asking her to please return the copy of The Atlantic that had Life in the Iron Mills in it.

08:02.846 --> 08:10.473
And that was how come I found out in the footnote that it was written by Rebecca Harding Davis.

08:11.394 --> 08:18.681
Because they did not, in those original Atlantics, have somebody's name.

08:19.221 --> 08:21.964
Now, I recognized what I thought was thorough,

08:22.433 --> 08:36.173
But I didn't know that it was he writing about Emerson until later on when I read Anna Farrow.

08:36.575 --> 08:47.372
And then the fact that I couldn't, that actually we were too poor and had too many kids, and the library was wonderful anyway, that there weren't many books I could buy.

08:47.532 --> 08:48.654
Let me interrupt for a second.

08:48.674 --> 08:50.537
Can you give me just what you said you were born?

08:50.557 --> 08:53.141
Can you just tell me where you were born and brought up?

08:53.241 --> 08:54.283
All right.

08:54.383 --> 08:55.504
Give me a little bit of the background.

08:55.605 --> 08:56.145
Well, all right.

08:56.246 --> 08:56.666
You've got time.

08:56.686 --> 08:57.007
I've got time.

08:57.027 --> 09:01.394
Well, I was born near Meade, Nebraska.

09:01.474 --> 09:01.654
Mm-hmm.

09:02.005 --> 09:15.261
in a little part of it that was called, I'm Told, though when I went to Meade, nobody remembered that, but I didn't talk to anybody, very old hogwash, or maybe this was just one of those legendary stories.

09:16.442 --> 09:19.506
While my parents were immigrants.

09:20.367 --> 09:20.707
From where?

09:21.168 --> 09:28.857
They were from the Ukraine in the old Russia, czarist Russia.

09:28.955 --> 09:40.947
My dad met my mother in the underground revolutionary movement, and my dad was the state secretary of the Socialist Party.

09:41.848 --> 09:41.988
Really?

09:42.008 --> 09:43.029
What was your father's name?

09:43.330 --> 09:43.630
What?

09:43.650 --> 09:44.911
What was your father's name?

09:45.151 --> 09:46.293
Samuel Lerner.

09:46.373 --> 09:50.577
There's a lot of material about this past stuff, but anyhow.

09:51.498 --> 09:55.722
And then we moved from the farm to...

09:56.073 --> 10:08.937
Omaha, and we moved first in the slaughterhouse section, and then we moved into what's called then North 24th Street, Omaha.

10:08.957 --> 10:14.827
That was, I can't think of a more wonderful neighborhood to grow up in.

10:15.388 --> 10:18.975
It was, I mean, our neighbors on both sides

10:19.512 --> 10:24.317
were, in those days, out of respect, we probably would have said color.

10:24.377 --> 10:26.159
That was before it began.

10:26.420 --> 10:30.444
You said Negro, and, you know, and then you went through the different things.

10:31.545 --> 10:42.837
And there were Sodders, that is, older people who'd been real pioneers and had come to the city to live late in, you know.

10:43.018 --> 10:45.580
Of course, to me, they seemed so old.

10:46.081 --> 10:47.983
There were Civil War vets.

10:48.858 --> 10:52.984
There were men and women who'd been slaves as kids.

10:53.024 --> 10:54.747
You have to remember how old I am.

10:54.847 --> 10:56.330
It sounds... How old are you?

10:56.530 --> 10:59.555
You didn't... Well, I am 85, and I have... Well, you're not 85.

10:59.575 --> 11:00.296
Yes, I am.

11:00.336 --> 11:01.838
Well, I was born in 1912.

11:03.400 --> 11:06.345
January 14th, 1912.

11:06.645 --> 11:13.977
You look absolutely... That's the biggest shock of the whole trip so far.

11:13.997 --> 11:15.239
Well... Congratulations.

11:15.259 --> 11:16.080
Congratulations.

11:16.482 --> 11:19.004
You're doing something absolutely right, whatever that is.

11:19.665 --> 11:21.387
Well, I look like I look.

11:21.927 --> 11:26.152
And so this is how my age looks, too.

11:28.734 --> 11:29.014
Wow.

11:29.094 --> 11:29.395
Right?

11:30.476 --> 11:32.017
Listen, my father's 86.

11:32.178 --> 11:33.078
He looks wonderful.

11:33.819 --> 11:34.300
All right.

11:34.400 --> 11:36.802
His hearing is terrible, but his mind is good.

11:37.182 --> 11:43.789
Well, my hearing, although I'm deaf in this ear, and I sometimes wear a hearing aid,

11:44.039 --> 11:54.155
I always wear it when I go to commission meetings, and I turn it on as somebody's talking into the microphone with their back to me, and they have a soft voice.

11:55.217 --> 12:02.830
Then I turn it up so I don't miss anything, but ordinarily I don't need a hearing aid, and my eyes are good.

12:02.930 --> 12:05.033
I have glasses for long distance.

12:05.193 --> 12:08.038
I have a problem with...

12:08.373 --> 12:12.820
Before my car died, that was the reason that I got them, were for driving.

12:12.840 --> 12:14.322
So you don't need glasses to read?

12:14.903 --> 12:16.766
No, I don't need glasses to read.

12:18.889 --> 12:27.062
I'm still looking for where it was that I paid that car that's one of the tributes to the library.

12:27.082 --> 12:30.788
I love this book, by the way, so you don't need that.

12:30.868 --> 12:34.313
Well, it's the book written by a reader.

12:36.757 --> 12:38.279
and it came out of reading.

12:38.319 --> 13:02.713
And I must tell you that out of the luck of my kind of reading at a certain historic moment, my kind of reading turned out to be very useful because there came a time when all of a sudden there was interest in more than what used to be called the canons.

13:03.048 --> 13:15.198
Now, part of my luck, see, I didn't tell you about my luck in Omaha besides my wonderful neighborhood that was such an education and the fact I stutter, which you haven't noticed, but I do sometimes stutter.

13:15.218 --> 13:21.484
It's not as bad as I was when I was growing up, so I was quiet a lot.

13:22.084 --> 13:22.865
And I listened.

13:22.945 --> 13:26.768
Well, I haven't done much stuttering with you.

13:26.808 --> 13:32.413
There are times when I probably will, but there are times when I do much more of it.

13:32.714 --> 13:37.919
Though I'm, you know, I get up and I speak, and then I seldom stutter.

13:39.141 --> 14:00.983
But anyhow, to try to make this fast, part of my luck, my great luck when it comes to books, was that my folks did urges to take out library cards.

14:01.773 --> 14:05.737
And I used to read books.

14:06.478 --> 14:10.763
It was summertime, and this was after apples.

14:10.803 --> 14:13.505
We actually had an apple tree in our backyard.

14:13.525 --> 14:17.730
I loved the apple seeds.

14:17.870 --> 14:18.691
I still do.

14:18.751 --> 14:26.559
And I would eat the inside, and then I would spit that part into the books.

14:26.739 --> 14:27.240
Well...

14:27.727 --> 14:41.927
The librarian at the Great Omaha Public Library, which, by the way, was that and a certain great movie house, were my two first intimations of grandeur.

14:41.987 --> 14:45.251
This library was really magnificent.

14:45.271 --> 14:47.575
It was one of the old Carnegie libraries.

14:47.595 --> 14:53.683
Well, there's a new library now, because I was just back again in Nebraska this last fall.

14:54.406 --> 15:10.401
And I went to the new library to look at it, but the old library crowned the hill like my classical high school did, but this was before I'd gotten to high school.

15:10.801 --> 15:23.653
Now, this librarian, she saw I loved reading books, and she explained to me how you should treat a book, and she said,

15:23.920 --> 15:26.463
see why she didn't take away my card.

15:27.305 --> 15:40.522
She didn't make me feel like I just expurgated my language, like dirt, because already I had some class sense, and I was very sensitive about shaming.

15:43.586 --> 15:53.860
She took and she showed me, this is a tribute to librarians now that I think of it, and their particular sensitivity.

15:54.262 --> 16:06.480
because so many children's books were such beautiful books, the illustrations in them, those colored illustrations.

16:07.041 --> 16:18.317
And she took Robert Louis Stevenson's Child Garden of Verses that had somebody who'd done a wonderful, wonderful series of illustrations.

16:19.139 --> 16:23.425
And she urged me, although it was a book that was hard for me, she thought,

16:23.860 --> 16:35.417
were to take out Peter Pan that had, you know, these, so imaginative, you know, nothing to do with my life.

16:35.977 --> 16:46.893
And then I'm trying to remember the name of that book about this rich girl who something happens and she becomes the poor abused girl.

16:46.913 --> 16:48.656
It's a famous kid's book.

16:48.716 --> 16:50.338
I'm trying to remember the name of it.

16:50.418 --> 16:52.281
Well, it'll probably occur to me.

16:52.632 --> 16:55.456
after a while, so that was part of my luck.

16:55.817 --> 17:03.749
Now, this gorgeous library, it had stairs that went to the upstairs part.

17:03.769 --> 17:20.175
In the landing, where you could see it from downstairs, was a huge picture of Willa Cather, a painting of Willa Cather, and I didn't know who she was at the time, though I had asked,

17:20.527 --> 17:31.138
But then as I began to read more, I began to read her too, though I read her poetry first before I got into the fiction.

17:31.158 --> 17:32.019
I didn't know she was a poet.

17:32.659 --> 17:33.820
Yes, oh yes.

17:37.184 --> 17:50.297
There's one volume of her verse, and people would not recognize some of it, whether it's a kind of love poem that she writes to a cowboy in it.

17:51.138 --> 18:04.613
Anyway, so, and then I had a very wonderful first grade teacher, Ms.

18:04.713 --> 18:07.516
Metz, who also... Metz, M-E-T-Z.

18:07.756 --> 18:09.618
M-E-T-Z.

18:10.099 --> 18:17.567
She wore those striped shirtwaists, and she, well, again,

18:17.733 --> 18:35.619
And I think when I was thinking of writers who've been so affected by books, the number of them who was a librarian, I mean a teacher, you know, who got them to read or to go to the library.

18:35.639 --> 18:43.150
Anyway, as I said, I had great luck there in Omaha, and then I crossed the tracks

18:44.227 --> 19:09.863
I was part of the first generation of the unwashed horde that was invading the high school that crowned the same hill where the library was, Omaha Central High, where the grandchildren of the Cody's, Buffalo Bill, and the Dow's, and the Fonda's, and various other, you know, they'd been...

19:10.366 --> 19:26.004
Some of them themselves had been sent east to prep school, and there was the attitude that Nebraska was the Wild West, and they hated it, and the kind of ribbing they had, and so they did everything to see to it.

19:26.024 --> 19:37.116
This was a real classical high school, and you had to learn Latin, and preferably Greek as well, and there were statues in the hall.

19:37.298 --> 19:38.921
Those statues are still there.

19:38.981 --> 19:40.443
The high school is still there.

19:40.463 --> 19:49.438
And it's still evidently considered to be just as good a college prep school as anything else.

19:49.758 --> 19:58.552
I heard the latest about this because I couldn't tell just by going back to visit, which I always do when I go to Omaha.

19:59.334 --> 20:02.559
But there was this young man at Stanford.

20:02.739 --> 20:04.622
I go every single year.

20:05.159 --> 20:08.703
And I speak to a group of freshmen.

20:08.743 --> 20:12.847
The last book in a special course they have is only a riddle.

20:13.868 --> 20:22.617
And so he spoke up very, very, very early and informed me that we were both graduates of the same high school.

20:24.939 --> 20:33.208
But I had a remarkable English teacher who, in spite of the fact, and I realized

20:33.475 --> 20:35.858
years later how I must have violated.

20:35.898 --> 20:38.242
She was a true lady.

20:38.342 --> 20:48.817
She was one of those who'd had a good education, but unlike others in her family, the man, the place for her to teach was in high school.

20:49.678 --> 20:56.428
And we had classic English, about

21:01.657 --> 21:06.963
This is one of the few books I have from childhood.

21:07.624 --> 21:09.887
And it's a pretty messed up book.

21:09.907 --> 21:10.027
Wow.

21:10.047 --> 21:10.788
You still have this book.

21:10.848 --> 21:12.109
I don't think the tape picked that up.

21:12.149 --> 21:13.651
This is a book from your childhood.

21:14.072 --> 21:14.532
And look at it.

21:14.712 --> 21:15.593
The spine is gone.

21:15.653 --> 21:16.735
It's been read to death.

21:17.335 --> 21:19.518
Well, it was a very secondhand book.

21:19.578 --> 21:20.159
And I don't know.

21:20.239 --> 21:21.560
Look at all the pieces of paper in there.

21:21.580 --> 21:22.301
Well, I'll tell you.

21:22.341 --> 21:27.327
You see, this is Upton Sinclair's The Cry for Justice.

21:27.678 --> 21:34.186
And this came from the Vineyard Shore School for Women Workers in Industry originally, I guess.

21:34.206 --> 21:37.630
And I don't know how it ever got to Omaha.

21:38.291 --> 21:41.434
But you see, you of course know who this is.

21:41.454 --> 21:43.016
This is the man with the hole.

21:44.798 --> 21:57.313
I would look up what else Keats or Shelley or Byron, especially Shelley and Byron were writing at the time that we did not have in our English class.

21:57.530 --> 22:09.222
And I was really troubled for my wonderful English teacher, who was really very exceptional.

22:09.763 --> 22:11.485
And you had this book for how long?

22:12.366 --> 22:15.589
Oh, well, my dad had it originally.

22:15.629 --> 22:24.158
And, you know, when I noticed that it was there, or how it got to my dad, I don't know.

22:24.418 --> 22:25.900
Oh, it was written in there?

22:25.964 --> 22:48.141
Well, when you wrote your book about collectors, and I thought of all those guys who had that money and knew about first editions and beautiful volumes and having complete sets of everything, and I thought about the kind of book collecting that, for instance...

22:48.880 --> 22:54.128
I, in a very untutored way, did, which had nothing to do with the look of the book.

22:54.208 --> 22:57.393
Of course, you had some book collectors they didn't care about.

22:57.453 --> 23:01.419
They didn't give a damn about it.

23:05.045 --> 23:16.202
Anyway, we wrote on prose rhythms and Thomas De Quincey, for instance.

23:16.222 --> 23:17.284
It was really what

23:18.040 --> 23:23.327
a very good college education in English literature.

23:23.788 --> 23:28.434
We didn't have anybody American except for some of Emerson's essays.

23:31.698 --> 23:32.840
I'm just taking some notes.

23:33.441 --> 23:33.661
What?

23:33.961 --> 23:36.064
I'm just taking some notes.

23:36.465 --> 23:37.306
Well, of course.

23:37.326 --> 23:46.478
I'm going to try to get the University of California to reissue that book in their California series,

23:46.812 --> 24:01.694
I just did a long afterword to a book called Bright Web of Darkness that's coming out in November, and so I know some of the people there.

24:01.855 --> 24:13.512
And this is a California book, although it's international and what it has in it and all that, but it was Jack London, who by the way was one of those

24:13.964 --> 24:20.535
It was out of the library that he read, because he did not have much education.

24:22.918 --> 24:24.621
I'm like taking all of this down.

24:25.603 --> 24:30.831
But London also was formed by what he read in the library on his own.

24:30.851 --> 24:40.647
Yes, of course, plus his own life, plus the kind of oral things that he heard.

24:41.116 --> 24:48.485
Things like the face on the barroom floor were very, very, I mean, reciting poetry.

24:48.665 --> 25:04.984
I mean, when I, when I, and it began when I was a child, and I would go to the black church around the corner, I was so fascinated when they would have the, by the recitations.

25:06.026 --> 25:08.929
And I would hear memorized poems.

25:09.668 --> 25:14.736
all kinds of poetry, all kinds of language.

25:15.357 --> 25:24.150
I do, and it should have been in the footnotes in my book, you know, in my fiction book, Oh Yes, I don't know if you read Oh Yes.

25:24.610 --> 25:25.612
Not yet, I will.

25:25.632 --> 25:29.458
Well, a lot of that language came out of what I heard.

25:29.578 --> 25:37.009
I mean, there's something called Alva's, it's not called that, but it's Alva's dream in that.

25:37.495 --> 25:41.079
And that goes back to the richness of my childhood.

25:42.800 --> 25:48.506
I'll give you something before you leave.

26:03.060 --> 26:05.663
By the way, Earlist Gaines is somebody else.

26:06.672 --> 26:08.133
I know his work, right?

26:08.153 --> 26:11.536
You know, Pulitzer Prize winner, and so forth and so on.

26:12.037 --> 26:25.909
But he came out of—he didn't go to San Francisco State except briefly, and this was after he'd been in the Navy.

26:25.949 --> 26:35.397
He was already a reader, but he got a lot of his passion for language, of course, out of the church.

26:36.170 --> 26:40.175
Um, and here's Robert Haas in here.

26:40.355 --> 26:43.740
There's, uh... No, this is, what is this magazine?

26:43.920 --> 26:50.348
This is, um, they selected, um, 20... This is Stanford, isn't it?

26:50.368 --> 26:51.570
Stanford, yes.

26:51.590 --> 26:59.841
And, uh, Stanford, as well as the Berg, has got, uh, you know... They did a marvelous exhibition.

27:00.341 --> 27:04.827
The New York Public Library did a marvelous exhibition very, quite recently on, uh,

27:05.431 --> 27:08.375
manuscripts, I don't know if you saw it, in New York?

27:08.615 --> 27:13.881
Well, I always go when I'm in New York, and you know why that I'm in the Berg.

27:13.941 --> 27:14.582
I know that.

27:14.602 --> 27:25.175
I was so thrilled when, when Mova Zloditz asked me that I immediately, she asked me for the makings of Yonandio since a lot more have turned up.

27:26.296 --> 27:29.440
Here's the, here are the writers.

27:29.460 --> 27:29.620
I see.

27:30.001 --> 27:31.703
And there are two of us women.

27:32.324 --> 27:35.067
Scott Turo was my pupil at, uh,

27:35.300 --> 27:36.702
Scott Turow studied under you.

27:36.922 --> 27:37.884
Well, at Amherst.

27:39.286 --> 27:39.426
Mm-hmm.

27:39.446 --> 27:41.909
He was writing very different things then.

27:44.012 --> 27:44.232
Mm-hmm.

27:44.312 --> 27:45.674
Tobias Wolfe, of course.

27:45.935 --> 27:46.295
Yes.

27:46.415 --> 27:46.716
Uh-huh.

27:46.776 --> 27:47.036
Yes.

27:47.076 --> 27:48.038
Philip Levine.

27:48.078 --> 27:48.378
Yes.

27:48.398 --> 27:50.020
This is quite a... Mm-hmm.

27:50.381 --> 27:50.561
Wow.

27:52.283 --> 27:54.907
This was published by Stanford University?

27:54.927 --> 27:55.007
Yes.

27:55.027 --> 27:55.167
Uh-huh.

27:55.228 --> 27:56.069
Wonderful.

27:58.452 --> 27:59.574
Bill McFerrin.

27:59.694 --> 28:02.197
He is a love.

28:02.317 --> 28:04.260
He is a real...

28:04.595 --> 28:33.977
lover of uh when was this published you know uh well it was well this was published see why why they had an exhibit for the 100th anniversary uh well i think it was in 1989 where he tells about the quake here that happened afterwards you see why they had they why they had this exhibit for the two months for their 100th year anniversary and uh

28:34.312 --> 28:39.741
But anyhow, nothing was heard.

28:40.222 --> 28:50.599
But in this, I tell about my making and also how important that time, even if I was

28:51.338 --> 28:57.124
I'm sure I can get a copy of this.

28:57.464 --> 29:02.990
If you give me your address, I will mail you one if I don't lay my hands on it right away.

29:03.010 --> 29:06.853
I know you have many other things to do.

29:07.013 --> 29:13.340
Anyhow, I was very fortunate in my high school and the fact that we had to go back to reading.

29:13.460 --> 29:15.282
Am I telling you what you'd like to hear?

29:15.302 --> 29:15.902
Yes, very much.

29:15.922 --> 29:16.323
All right.

29:18.145 --> 29:20.687
We had one hour period

29:21.477 --> 29:26.261
There was supposed to be a study period, and we could go to the library.

29:26.982 --> 29:35.469
Well, I didn't do much of my homework, and I really needed to because I was working after school.

29:35.589 --> 29:39.432
I didn't have time, you know, or time at home.

29:39.452 --> 29:43.996
So, anyhow, so I read.

29:44.016 --> 29:51.062
And then, too, I'd been determined I was going to read everything,

29:51.515 --> 29:56.945
everything I cared to read in the Omaha Public Library.

29:56.985 --> 30:04.118
And I would try to get down there, and young people don't need that much sleep.

30:05.500 --> 30:12.072
Anyhow, but then I began to want to have some books, and that's when I discovered

30:12.811 --> 30:22.185
It would always be outside in these bins, not in shelves, but in bins outside of one of the secondhand bookstores.

30:22.866 --> 30:38.288
And they all were, well, they were like my copy of Life in the Iron Mills, which was that old Atlantic, where I didn't know who published what, because in that year they did not have people's last names.

30:38.408 --> 30:41.232
So that's, oh, that's what started I talking about.

30:41.482 --> 30:44.325
Thomas Wentworth Higginson, that great American.

30:44.365 --> 30:55.618
And by the way, why do you know who John Brown wanted to come down and get his wife and kids and bring them up to Concord and so forth and so on?

30:55.678 --> 30:59.122
And you know about who found out.

31:00.483 --> 31:03.967
Well, I learned some of this from the Cambridge Public Library.

31:03.987 --> 31:05.789
You better not get me started there.

31:05.829 --> 31:09.413
But the wonderful value of going to places

31:09.680 --> 31:13.890
And this was, you know, in the archives that they had about him.

31:14.632 --> 31:24.917
But how it was he found out about Nat Turner, who he had not been able to get any information on, you know, in the contemporary newspapers.

31:24.957 --> 31:26.541
Everything had disappeared.

31:27.078 --> 31:38.334
And Thomas Wentworth Higginson came from a family that not only had Southern relatives, but, you know, it was a highly educated Harvard family, all of that stuff.

31:38.654 --> 31:45.965
He's the same man, by the way, who married Lucy Stone and suddenly forgotten, you know, the one who had all the sisters.

31:46.826 --> 31:57.000
Well, anyhow, I'm digressing, but to get back to my own life.

31:57.436 --> 32:06.905
So I would try, fortunately, bookstores would be open on Sunday sometimes as well as Saturday sometimes.

32:07.025 --> 32:26.683
I would try to poke around and see what I could pick up for a nickel or a dime or sometimes fisking cents or sometimes a quarter, and I began to acquire a few books of my very, very, very own.

32:27.170 --> 32:37.144
But I was fortunate in having access to those two libraries.

32:37.224 --> 32:44.434
And then I worked as a mother's helper where I lived, except on weekends.

32:44.654 --> 32:52.485
And they were very educated people and had a wonderful library, but it was all...

32:52.702 --> 32:53.923
modern fiction.

32:54.804 --> 33:03.634
And they subscribed, I can't think of the name of that magazine, it had held drawings in it.

33:03.654 --> 33:11.162
When you were getting these secondhand books, was there a specific focus, were there specific kinds of books, or just all kinds of books?

33:12.204 --> 33:13.245
No, no.

33:13.305 --> 33:16.488
It looked interesting to me.

33:16.548 --> 33:22.455
Well, it was like my browsing reading, although if I fell in love with somebody,

33:22.790 --> 33:37.383
I tried to read everything that they had ever written, and I never read biographies or autobiographies, except I did read one of Lafcadio Hearn, who was one of the people I fell in love with.

33:38.224 --> 33:39.205
Interesting question.

33:39.225 --> 33:39.365
What?

33:39.385 --> 33:40.346
He's a fascinating person.

33:40.366 --> 33:52.797
He's a fascinating person, and I loved why the books that they had, you know, glutes of unfamiliar Japan, and I loved the description

33:53.047 --> 34:07.041
of him as this—because he was myopic and couldn't see well, and because he was so slight and small, the Japanese accepted him as one of their own.

34:07.361 --> 34:17.151
Of course, he troubled to learn languages right away, unlike most—well, not that he was really born an American, you know.

34:17.171 --> 34:21.315
He had a mixed heritage and all that.

34:21.565 --> 34:25.229
Yes, well, I read everything of his that I could lay my hands on.

34:25.309 --> 34:39.244
When I fell in love with Catherine Mansfield through her journal, then I began to look for journals as well, but I read everything of hers that I could lay my hands on.

34:39.464 --> 34:42.007
How old were you at this particular time?

34:42.027 --> 34:44.229
Oh, I was 15, 16, 17.

34:44.650 --> 34:49.615
My own diaries that have some of my comments on my reading...

34:49.831 --> 34:51.493
are down at Stanford.

34:58.643 --> 35:10.740
So between my English classes till I got thrown out by my English, my beloved English teacher, I started to tell you how I used to wipe my nose on my sleeve.

35:11.161 --> 35:15.907
It was the day before Kleenex was invented, you know, among other things.

35:16.949 --> 35:18.471
And I would often...

35:19.480 --> 35:48.255
forget my slender books and so forth and so on, but I really loved that teacher so much, but it was very mixed, and I would sometimes be embarrassed by how passionate but controlled she'd be in talking about the books we were going to read, and this was the year

35:48.640 --> 35:52.003
that we were going to read all of Shakespeare.

35:52.044 --> 35:57.990
And fortunately, there were slender books, not the poetry, but the plays.

35:58.650 --> 36:00.793
And each book was a slender book.

36:01.633 --> 36:05.417
And we had Macbeth.

36:06.959 --> 36:07.800
Not Macbeth.

36:08.400 --> 36:09.982
We already had had Macbeth.

36:10.042 --> 36:11.243
We had Hamlet.

36:11.944 --> 36:15.408
And she gave this perfect lecture.

36:15.448 --> 36:17.770
She really should have been teaching in college.

36:18.205 --> 36:36.243
And it was about the perfect way that all the plays were constructed, and how there was never, he never slipped up, there was never any kind of a contradiction, and I'm making saying it very, very fast.

36:36.263 --> 36:45.833
So I raised my hand, and I said, well, how is it then that...

36:46.167 --> 36:54.619
There he gives that famous speech about to be or not to be and that undiscovered born from which no traveler returns.

36:55.800 --> 36:58.484
And he's just been talking to his dead father.

36:58.504 --> 37:06.795
Well, if I thought about it, I would have realized this was in a dream and so forth and so on.

37:06.855 --> 37:09.799
And we have dreams and all kinds of things happen in dreams.

37:10.300 --> 37:11.682
She'd never thought of that.

37:12.423 --> 37:14.706
And she looked at me and looked at me.

37:15.260 --> 37:20.345
And she lost her cool, probably the only time she ever had.

37:20.505 --> 37:33.577
I feel terrible about it to this day, especially after I went to the Historical Society, time before last I was in Omaha, and learned that they were having an exhibit about her.

37:33.597 --> 37:35.659
She was a very famous English teacher.

37:35.699 --> 37:35.879
Miss Mix.

37:35.899 --> 37:39.883
She produced all kinds of students who wrote and all that.

37:40.143 --> 37:41.625
Do you remember her first name, Miss Mix?

37:41.645 --> 37:43.286
Yes, Sarah Vore Taylor.

37:44.547 --> 37:45.148
Sarah?

37:45.230 --> 37:54.880
And I contributed my old style book that she put out and had given to all of her pupils.

37:55.641 --> 38:11.018
And before I got my first honorary degree, the night before, they had a dinner for the other people who were getting honorary degrees and some of the faculty at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln.

38:11.437 --> 38:15.302
And it was surprising how many of them had had Sarah Vora Taylor.

38:15.943 --> 38:17.685
And we got to talking about her.

38:17.705 --> 38:19.647
She really was extraordinary.

38:19.748 --> 38:20.448
But anyhow.

38:20.589 --> 38:21.950
So you said she lost her cool.

38:22.151 --> 38:22.831
What did she say?

38:23.292 --> 38:37.570
Well, by the way, I discovered at that time I went to the Omaha, Douglas County Historical Society, this exhibit about her, that that was the year that her mother was dying of cancer.

38:38.211 --> 38:39.132
And she was...

38:39.365 --> 38:41.708
The only daughter still alive.

38:41.728 --> 38:48.015
So I gather she'd been going through a lot of personal hell that I didn't know about.

38:48.055 --> 38:58.047
So then I felt even more terrible that I never wrote her and told her how indebted I was to her and so forth and so on.

38:58.448 --> 39:01.291
This got nothing to do with reading in a way.

39:01.391 --> 39:02.793
What did she say?

39:02.813 --> 39:04.034
You said she lost her cool.

39:04.074 --> 39:05.095
Did she say something?

39:05.115 --> 39:05.676
Oh, yes.

39:05.842 --> 39:07.243
She threw that book at me.

39:07.303 --> 39:08.865
She hit me in the forehead.

39:09.025 --> 39:09.085
No!

39:09.105 --> 39:10.346
She threw the book?

39:10.446 --> 39:12.728
It was a slender book, fortunately.

39:12.768 --> 39:20.976
I can imagine how she probably felt like going through the floor and didn't know what to say of the class.

39:21.016 --> 39:25.500
She probably ignored the whole thing and went right on with her lectures.

39:26.461 --> 39:27.502
But I never asked.

39:27.582 --> 39:35.089
She told me to go sit down in Dean Town's office and stay there for the rest of the semester.

39:35.761 --> 39:39.485
I think it was one of the reasons I dropped out of... My God.

39:39.905 --> 39:42.028
Why was she so upset with the question?

39:42.068 --> 39:45.231
That's not a... It wasn't the question.

39:45.351 --> 39:49.516
It was the fact that she had thrown the book at me, I think.

39:49.716 --> 40:00.688
She threw the book at you because you asked the students... I know, but you see, but then I was very... I mean, I had written... She had...

40:01.090 --> 40:11.426
She was kind of distressed when she heard that some of us had gone to hear Carl Sandburg.

40:11.466 --> 40:13.990
She wasn't much for a modern American.

40:14.371 --> 40:21.141
But she went ahead and she read him, which he'd never done before, really, except a few of his poems, I guess.

40:21.863 --> 40:26.193
Yeah, but you don't get mad at a student for going off to hear a poet.

40:26.333 --> 40:29.280
I mean, this is almost anti-intellectual in a way.

40:29.300 --> 40:38.421
Well, listen, I can't even bear to have you say that because, as I said, when I...

40:38.722 --> 40:44.488
found out that that was the time that her mother was dying of cancer, which I did not know.

40:44.508 --> 40:45.909
There was some explanation.

40:46.069 --> 40:50.794
But I had, and I started to tell you we don't have time for the high school stories.

40:50.834 --> 40:52.335
There's too much else to cover.

40:53.236 --> 41:07.530
But that, she, I had tried her time after time after time.

41:07.949 --> 41:14.697
And one of the things was around Carl Sandburg.

41:15.238 --> 41:19.383
There we were, and it was, oh, God, that's right.

41:19.403 --> 41:22.867
We were studying Keats' Lady of the Lake.

41:24.549 --> 41:26.552
I mean, I was really obnoxious.

41:26.712 --> 41:33.180
I mean, I was known in that high school for, I think it was, out of...

41:34.105 --> 41:37.569
partly a certain kind of class pride.

41:37.609 --> 41:57.290
Now, my brothers and sisters, I don't know how it was for my oldest sister, and she says she's forgotten practically everything about high school, but my baby brother, to this day, he can go on about what a cross it was for him to have to bear that I was his oldest sister.

41:57.390 --> 42:03.657
He lived it down, I mean, and my youngest baby sister was so brilliant and got

42:03.940 --> 42:09.686
all the top grades and got all the honors when she graduated and so forth and so on.

42:09.706 --> 42:11.208
Why were you a cross to bear?

42:11.448 --> 42:11.769
What?

42:11.829 --> 42:13.431
Why were you such a cross to bear?

42:13.451 --> 42:17.075
I was a cross to bear because this was, it was a certain period.

42:17.936 --> 42:19.738
You behaved in your classes.

42:20.318 --> 42:22.381
You had respect for your teachers.

42:23.282 --> 42:32.412
And I was someone who was already outrageous in the very fact that, among other things, I mean, this has to do with, well, I wore...

42:33.050 --> 42:37.860
That's somebody in my castoffs from our dean.

42:37.960 --> 42:46.198
Though it was a flapper period, and I know why her mother

42:46.533 --> 42:48.756
turned that particular dress over.

42:48.816 --> 42:50.358
It was the flapper period.

42:50.378 --> 42:53.642
I'm telling you ridiculous things that aren't very pertinent.

42:53.682 --> 42:56.365
Well, you had what they call today an attitude.

42:56.765 --> 42:59.188
You had an attitude problem, it sounds like.

42:59.469 --> 43:03.594
I had an attitude, but I also combined it with a reverence.

43:04.975 --> 43:15.308
I mean, if it was a class I loved and I got so much out of her classes, I mean, I owe her so much to this day.

43:16.570 --> 43:19.093
and always will to my dying day.

43:19.153 --> 43:22.597
So you dropped out of school?

43:23.338 --> 43:23.718
Yes.

43:24.399 --> 43:25.841
And was this to me?

43:25.941 --> 43:27.843
Well, it was.

43:27.863 --> 43:39.336
Well, it would have been my last year, but that was certainly, it was very, very terrible for me, because I told you I really revered her.

43:39.376 --> 43:42.780
She really loved literature.

43:43.115 --> 43:49.663
She was very closed, and I didn't tell you about Carl Sandburg, so here we are.

43:49.743 --> 43:58.693
We're reading Lady in the Lake, which, by the way, was the worst thing, I think, to have, you know, to have someone read out of Keats, although we had some of those.

43:58.753 --> 43:59.654
Is Keats write Lady in the Lake?

44:00.395 --> 44:00.735
Yes.

44:01.236 --> 44:02.397
Is it Keats?

44:02.417 --> 44:03.258
Maybe it was.

44:03.278 --> 44:06.342
Is that Keats, Lady in the Lake?

44:06.402 --> 44:07.283
We'll check that out.

44:07.702 --> 44:09.604
Yeah, well, I have to check that out.

44:09.664 --> 44:12.868
It's strange that it makes me... Oh, no, who?

44:13.229 --> 44:13.690
Shelley.

44:13.830 --> 44:14.971
Shelley.

44:14.991 --> 44:16.032
Not that Keats.

44:16.173 --> 44:16.513
Shelley.

44:16.613 --> 44:19.917
No, well, Keats died... He died 26 years old.

44:20.338 --> 44:24.042
But, oh, how I loved Ode to the Nightingale.

44:24.183 --> 44:28.748
I can recite it all to this day.

44:28.869 --> 44:37.219
And, you know, and she taught many things that I loved at the same time that... I mean, she really formed my...

44:37.823 --> 44:44.091
you know, and to give us De Quincey and have us write about prose rhythms.

44:46.274 --> 44:48.236
I mean, this is... It's remarkable.

44:48.256 --> 44:48.637
You're right.

44:48.657 --> 44:53.062
This is high-level college stuff, which I didn't... She should have been teaching college lectures, which she should have been teaching.

44:53.303 --> 44:54.604
Yes, absolutely.

44:54.704 --> 44:58.109
I was an English major in college, and this sounds like college-level stuff.

44:58.129 --> 44:59.150
Absolutely, absolutely.

44:59.170 --> 45:01.873
Yes, which I didn't recognize until years later.

45:02.454 --> 45:06.379
I started to tell you about my reading, so I'd better leave high school.

45:06.865 --> 45:11.590
But the reading I began to do at that time, part of that... Now on your own.

45:11.690 --> 45:14.913
Now you're reading totally on your own after you left high school.

45:15.273 --> 45:32.991
Well, but it had to do also with my other reading background, which had to do that I went to the Socialist Sunday School, which had to do that there was a wonderful doctor, Dr. Jefferson,

45:33.308 --> 45:40.441
who gave when he saw I was a reader, and he thought my dad would be interested.

45:40.461 --> 45:54.726
My mother never learned to read English well, but my dad did, and my dad spoke very well, too.

45:55.263 --> 46:05.819
copies of the Comrade, bound copies of the Comrade from the early 1900s when socialism was really international and all kinds of great names.

46:05.839 --> 46:07.802
I still have those two volumes.

46:07.822 --> 46:08.163
Really?

46:08.563 --> 46:08.844
Yes.

46:09.164 --> 46:09.845
Uh-huh, yeah.

46:09.865 --> 46:21.523
If you want to take a look, I'll drag them out and you can look at them while I'm... But, you know, it's astonishing what and who you would find in them.

46:22.246 --> 46:26.612
And I told you about the cry for justice.

46:27.494 --> 46:41.594
So I was getting more than the classical canon already, plus the fact I early on became a member, ardent member of the Young Communist League, and I came to San Francisco.

46:41.635 --> 46:50.127
And there were emigres from all the countries where...

46:50.545 --> 46:58.108
Terrible governments had crushed democratic movements, which was what was happening in the 20s, including in Japan.

46:59.084 --> 47:01.747
It's wonderful living in my neighborhood.

47:01.847 --> 47:05.591
By the way, did you salute the red flag of China?

47:05.751 --> 47:12.698
And a block down is the center street for Japantown.

47:13.579 --> 47:15.962
Close street by the legendary one.

47:16.162 --> 47:17.864
So when did you come to San Francisco?

47:17.884 --> 47:18.404
About when?

47:19.585 --> 47:22.368
Well, I came first in 1930.

47:22.548 --> 47:23.730
I went back home.

47:26.272 --> 47:28.855
Briefly, I was down in Kansas City.

47:29.003 --> 47:41.932
Casey on the Kansas side, where I both worked in the slaughterhouses and where I was arrested for the second time and spent some time, actually, where I got pleurisy.

47:42.192 --> 47:45.620
This is for political activities?

47:45.640 --> 47:45.860
What?

47:45.880 --> 47:47.063
Why did you get arrested?

47:47.380 --> 47:48.922
Well, I got arrested.

47:48.942 --> 47:53.469
I was passing out a leaflet that I... A political activity, so to speak.

47:53.489 --> 48:03.624
Well, it was because I was passing out a leaflet about how you should join the union outside Cudahy's.

48:04.425 --> 48:09.152
I was actually working at, was it Swift?

48:11.039 --> 48:14.222
I don't even remember the exact... That's okay.

48:14.242 --> 48:15.183
Well, it doesn't matter.

48:15.243 --> 48:19.186
But anyhow, and then I came and I lived in Stockton for a while.

48:19.206 --> 48:25.392
I had a little girl when I came back to California, my daughter Carla.

48:25.412 --> 48:28.935
There were the two of us against the world, so to speak.

48:29.896 --> 48:40.405
And I shan't talk about...

48:41.330 --> 49:03.001
This is one of the books about me, but the only one in which I say things about... I can Xerox for you when I talk about what those seamen, what the seagoing guys and the emigres did for my knowledge of the... This is about Oh Yes.

49:03.061 --> 49:04.904
What's the title of the book?

49:06.046 --> 49:10.392
It's just called A Study of the Short Fiction.

49:10.709 --> 49:17.436
But one of my pieces is called, Hey, Sailor, What's Ship?

49:18.137 --> 49:23.503
And you see... Oh, sure.

49:25.985 --> 49:28.868
This is a very important thing to know.

49:29.469 --> 49:33.033
And you know how come B. Traven became a writer, too.

49:33.073 --> 49:34.294
There you go.

49:35.395 --> 49:37.037
That's right.

49:37.237 --> 49:38.659
Okay, and this is published by whom?

49:38.679 --> 49:39.781
Maybe I can find it.

49:39.801 --> 49:53.261
Oh, it's published by a terrible publisher who's done nothing with it, and it's so much the best book about my work and the only book in which I also have my own, you know, say about my writing.

49:53.381 --> 49:54.002
Really?

49:54.022 --> 49:55.304
I'll try and get a copy of this.

49:55.404 --> 49:58.588
I'm not sure if you'll have it at Harvard.

49:59.009 --> 49:59.930
Yes, yes.

50:00.571 --> 50:02.434
But...

50:02.482 --> 50:07.388
And that page you just pointed out, I think it was page 151, I think.

50:08.169 --> 50:13.756
Well, if you look, for instance, about Hayes Sailor, which is about those seamen.

50:20.044 --> 50:28.514
But I came to a lot of literature, like Jose Rizal, you know who he is.

50:28.894 --> 50:31.037
He was the hero of the Philippines.

50:31.760 --> 50:36.725
He was executed before 1898.

50:37.046 --> 50:40.629
It was when the Spanish took over the Philippines.

50:40.669 --> 50:41.550
I think it was.

50:41.670 --> 50:43.212
Maybe it was 1898.

50:43.272 --> 50:59.269
And by the way, there were a marvelous group of writers, including Mark Twain, who... I'm listening.

51:00.110 --> 51:06.338
who did everything they could to make known the horrible things that were happening there and that we were doing.

51:06.558 --> 51:18.834
And somebody whose name I can't think of now, it had three, he had a middle name, an ode in a time of hesitation, wrote a poem, Are We the Eagle Nation?

51:19.716 --> 51:29.188
Milton knew something, something about, you know, liberty and truth, or are we but the... Where was that published?

51:29.557 --> 51:46.320
Oh, oh, oh, oh, this is, it's just an interview that some young kids in, um, was published in Lokator, which is their, they publish once a year, and it was in Joliet, Illinois, which is a working class.

51:46.781 --> 51:59.378
But in this high school, they had these first generation of their family to really have good teachers who were interested that they read widely and so on.

52:00.050 --> 52:05.356
This book was just published in 1995, apparently.

52:05.376 --> 52:06.698
This is a pretty recent book.

52:06.718 --> 52:09.601
That's the last of the books.

52:10.582 --> 52:12.905
Wait a minute, I think there's been one book since.

52:13.326 --> 52:19.853
There are six or seven books that concern my work.

52:19.933 --> 52:29.044
I don't know which one of them is by... I was just called before you came with some good news, good news work.

52:29.716 --> 52:33.361
for the family.

52:33.381 --> 52:37.105
They went down in T. Deirdre 800, these two.

52:37.786 --> 52:43.774
This was taken about three years before at McDowell Colony.

52:43.914 --> 52:49.121
Constance Poiner, and she did one of the books about me.

52:49.161 --> 52:51.684
It was really her dissertation.

52:51.944 --> 52:54.227
I'll be able to find this.

52:54.267 --> 52:55.429
Harvard will have it all.

52:55.509 --> 52:58.913
Well, there's a, you know, like a book series, and

52:59.264 --> 53:03.268
But I really love Joanne Fry's.

53:03.288 --> 53:04.029
Good.

53:04.049 --> 53:06.371
And it's recent, so it should be in print.

53:06.431 --> 53:07.292
I'll be able to get it.

53:07.352 --> 53:08.553
They're all in print.

53:08.593 --> 53:10.015
They're all still in print.

53:10.035 --> 53:14.179
I'm pretty sure what all of the other books do.

53:14.259 --> 53:23.808
And Oxford just called me to say that they were going to put out Constance Coiner's book in paperback now.

53:24.689 --> 53:27.752
And they asked for permission to use the pictures in it.

53:28.087 --> 53:37.016
But that's about my, that's about Maradola Seur and me and about our having been reds.

53:37.036 --> 53:53.892
Well, I want to tell you about, go back to reading, which is what, so I learned both from the seafaring guys I knew and from the emigres I got, and I was part of an international movement too.

53:54.613 --> 53:57.115
I learned about riders.

53:57.685 --> 54:02.711
who were not, who I'd never run across in the library, and some of whom were not.

54:03.913 --> 54:19.373
And you take any of the recent anthologies, the top two shelves and all that stuff there are all anthologies that have some of my things in it, and there's more underneath there and more there.

54:19.555 --> 54:21.838
And more in the back room.

54:21.938 --> 54:28.106
There's a lot of anthologies, and I've been very interested in the changes in them in the years.

54:28.226 --> 54:47.892
And, of course, the... By the Norton still is very... Well, it doesn't have, to use that scorn word, diversity, that so many of the other college anthologies...

54:48.260 --> 54:54.590
do, although they always have something of mine, too.

54:55.371 --> 55:13.879
But as a result of my very unacademic reading, not only libraries, though there were books I got from the library, sometimes an interlibrary loan that I learned about because of

55:14.399 --> 55:16.782
those who I got to know who were here.

55:16.842 --> 55:18.524
That's how come out.

55:18.544 --> 55:19.385
Here being San Francisco.

55:19.405 --> 55:19.725
What?

55:19.745 --> 55:21.487
Here being San Francisco, you mean.

55:21.507 --> 55:22.428
Well, that's right.

55:22.769 --> 55:31.819
And are having, you know, we have much more of the world now, but anyhow, so did I learn about certain Chinese writers.

55:32.840 --> 55:44.153
And so, for instance, when I heard accidentally that, to me, the great Ding Ling, she was originally published and everything I read as Ting Ling,

55:44.470 --> 55:51.839
but I don't have time to talk, tell too much about the teachers that I had.

55:51.939 --> 55:54.462
I mean, the literature.

55:54.923 --> 56:13.566
But there came a time, it was 1971, December, and I had already, the Feminist Press had already been established, and I was able to, from the beginning, to suggest books to them so that they published a writer you've probably never heard of,

56:13.934 --> 56:41.292
Somebody else whose education, although she did have a year in Arizona State Teachers College, Agnes Medley, who is the, well, she wrote a number of books, but an autobiography that just, she became such an important writer to me because it was the first book outside of, well,

56:41.744 --> 56:42.926
Ruth Succo.

56:43.166 --> 56:45.209
See, I'm beginning to talk to you about books.

56:46.832 --> 56:49.155
There was something about farm life.

56:49.316 --> 56:58.690
But anyhow, we should be talking about writers who...

56:59.243 --> 57:07.972
or great beings or well-known beings who came out of, for instance, prison reading, you know, libraries.

57:08.072 --> 57:10.254
That's important to have in your book.

57:10.274 --> 57:10.734
I think so.

57:10.754 --> 57:14.258
Because presumably, you know, this is pampering them.

57:14.939 --> 57:17.661
Well, pampering them is by giving them books.

57:17.841 --> 57:18.482
That's right.

57:19.043 --> 57:26.550
Oh, all up and down in our terrible prison system here in most prisons in California.

57:27.813 --> 57:44.919
It's all right to watch some TV, well, especially as that can be taken away from you if there's lockdown or something, and then you have nothing to do but in your crowded cell room, because there's no longer, do you have isolation unless you're down in the hole or in solitary.

57:44.959 --> 57:46.681
Well, that's another subject, too.

57:47.302 --> 57:57.077
Anyhow, but I have to tell you that it turned out that because these academics

57:57.614 --> 58:09.051
who'd had good educations, the kind I had, although they also knew American literature, some American literature, were the classics.

58:11.555 --> 58:22.912
I was asked to speak, among my other deaths of this year, is someone called Elaine Hedges, who is a professor at Tosin and who wrote several books.

58:23.373 --> 58:25.596
But she thought to invite me

58:25.947 --> 58:42.005
because she knew that I had told the feminist press about Daughter of Earth and about a book that, about what became famous in Charlotte Perkins Gilman and so forth and so on, and that I had quite a reading list.

58:42.025 --> 58:52.917
And my class at Amherst, I didn't tell you about Amherst, 69, 69, 70,

58:54.398 --> 59:01.587
I was asked out of the blue to come to Amherst to teach fiction.

59:02.628 --> 59:19.769
And I said, I was in MacDowell Colony, I said, all right, I will come if I feel that it's a place where, you know, where I might be of some use, and I would like to teach.

59:20.530 --> 59:23.173
But I said, frankly, you know, I don't know.

59:24.031 --> 59:25.353
much about college.

59:25.433 --> 59:26.894
I haven't had it myself.

59:27.795 --> 59:44.976
Afterwards, I felt bitter that nobody thought to explain to me, you're supposed to have a syllabus, and you're supposed to have a reading list as well, an additional reading list, and you're supposed to order your books ahead of time, and you're supposed to have a title for your class.

59:45.293 --> 59:47.696
ahead of time and all of these things.

59:48.216 --> 59:54.544
But regardless, well, I went there and I went to, and I asked to go to a class that was not an English class.

59:54.564 --> 01:00:01.051
I went to a sociology class, and it was the time they were beginning to take scholarship kids.

01:00:01.952 --> 01:00:11.824
And there was this, they were discussing, is it Oscar Lewis who wrote a book about

01:00:13.458 --> 01:00:17.983
Poor people, I've forgotten the name of the book.

01:00:18.003 --> 01:00:21.187
There's something else I have to remember the name before you leave.

01:00:21.247 --> 01:00:36.225
Anyhow, it was quite, you know, anyhow, one of the, one of these young men, it was an all-male college, stood up.
