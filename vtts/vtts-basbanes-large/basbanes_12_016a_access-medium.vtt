WEBVTT

00:02.073 --> 00:03.215
All right.

00:03.235 --> 00:03.796
Nice to meet you.

00:04.256 --> 00:04.757
Good to meet you.

00:04.777 --> 00:05.578
That's actually funny.

00:05.979 --> 00:06.720
It works.

00:06.800 --> 00:07.281
I believe you.

00:07.341 --> 00:07.842
I believe you.

00:07.962 --> 00:08.483
I believe you.

00:10.266 --> 00:11.107
And pointed to you.

00:11.848 --> 00:15.754
I have to say, starting this book, I'm a little jarred by the male voice.

00:16.115 --> 00:21.423
Are you unaccustomed to a male voice, isn't it?

00:21.443 --> 00:23.506
No, because I don't know who the author is.

00:24.848 --> 00:24.908
Oh.

00:25.293 --> 00:28.677
I was very clever about this, because most authors like to put their... Did you notice?

00:28.757 --> 00:31.480
I did not have my name anywhere on the inside.

00:31.500 --> 00:32.821
I didn't notice that.

00:32.841 --> 00:39.008
That was an intentional Philip to help the reader suspend belief.

00:39.108 --> 00:41.731
I mean, I wanted this to be Noah's book.

00:42.311 --> 00:46.856
And then if they looked up and saw Marianne Wiggins running across the top of the page... Continually.

00:46.956 --> 00:48.718
Yeah, so I made that...

00:48.901 --> 00:53.225
You were fearful then that the reader might have it?

00:53.305 --> 00:58.951
No, I don't think fear was the motivation necessarily, but care.

00:59.071 --> 01:00.613
I didn't want any detail.

01:00.633 --> 01:04.156
I was planning a perfect feat.

01:04.176 --> 01:06.939
You did it within the first graph or so, a paragraph.

01:06.959 --> 01:15.668
Well, I had a very good friend, male friend, read the manuscript when it was finished to let me know.

01:16.036 --> 01:23.708
Although, you know, I have vast experience with the opposite sex in terms of how they think and what they do.

01:24.790 --> 01:30.398
I was worried that I might have, I mean, I don't think Noah is particularly blokey enough, for example.

01:30.418 --> 01:33.403
There's not a single mention of sports in this.

01:33.873 --> 01:40.580
And I asked Rick to look at this, and he said, you know, I thought he was a real asshole.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.463
I had grown very fond of him.

01:42.723 --> 01:43.564
So I thought, okay.

01:43.584 --> 01:44.204
Well, that's good, though.

01:44.224 --> 01:44.745
You wanted that.

01:44.985 --> 01:47.488
Yeah, yeah, I did.

01:47.949 --> 01:52.093
Was this the artistic challenge for you to do this in the voiceover?

01:52.113 --> 01:52.534
No.

01:52.694 --> 01:55.677
So what were the artistic challenges?

01:55.757 --> 01:57.499
No, that wasn't the challenge.

01:57.800 --> 02:01.804
And in fact, where I think the voice fails...

02:02.172 --> 02:06.135
is that Noah, any journalist will tell you, Noah's not a journalist.

02:06.556 --> 02:07.997
He doesn't think like a journalist.

02:08.017 --> 02:09.838
He thinks like a novelist.

02:09.959 --> 02:11.440
He doesn't write like a journalist.

02:11.580 --> 02:12.741
He writes like a poet.

02:13.221 --> 02:19.787
And my severe complaint with him was that I always felt that he wasn't as good a writer as I am.

02:20.407 --> 02:28.634
So I was having to pull back and not... That's why I have him always complaining that he isn't allowed to wax poetic.

02:29.976 --> 02:31.757
Because I was dying to do that

02:32.108 --> 02:33.210
And I knew that he wouldn't.

02:33.270 --> 02:37.275
And he doesn't go subject, predicate, subject, predicate.

02:37.335 --> 02:44.065
You know, he doesn't drive the way that his prose, the way that a trained journalist would do.

02:44.245 --> 02:46.368
So that was really the artistic challenge.

02:47.049 --> 02:47.750
Not the gender.

02:47.790 --> 02:51.895
The gender was never an issue because I've read boys' books from the time I was reading.

02:52.156 --> 02:59.185
I mean, I just moved the gender... I just twisted Moby Dick a little this way and moved Ahab into something that I could understand.

03:00.067 --> 03:00.327
Well...

03:00.678 --> 03:07.951
But nevertheless, from the standpoint of being the writer, to create kind of this male sexual creature?

03:08.092 --> 03:16.307
I think the difficulty in writing, in cross-gender writing, is to avoid the pitfall of writing through the anatomy.

03:17.328 --> 03:24.762
And in the beginning, I think I was a little too conscious of the difference anatomy would make.

03:25.197 --> 03:28.981
I mean, he gets an erection in the back of a taxi on page, what, 17?

03:29.121 --> 03:31.083
Real, real fast.

03:31.163 --> 03:32.624
Real fast, we're writing anatomy.

03:33.265 --> 03:41.453
And I thought, you know, I don't want to play it that way from here, you know, through the rest of the book.

03:41.473 --> 03:46.097
And, not to give the plot away, as you know, if you've read the book... Did you finish reading the book?

03:46.117 --> 03:46.918
You have to forgive me.

03:46.938 --> 03:52.403
I've had four interviews this week, so I'm... But there is a...

03:52.855 --> 03:56.400
Anatomy plays a major part in Berlin.

03:57.381 --> 04:09.238
And so I had to play that very, very, very carefully and not depend on anatomical dictates, but to depend on the commonality of the sexes.

04:09.258 --> 04:16.789
I mean, there are a number of my male friends that I talk to the same way I talk to my best female friends.

04:18.071 --> 04:21.175
And I find them sensitive and caring and loving and

04:21.779 --> 04:23.882
The gender was not the artistic challenge.

04:23.902 --> 04:32.213
Well, you say, don't worry about giving it away, by the way, because I am professional enough to, I won't let that bother me.

04:32.233 --> 04:34.997
So if you want to talk about the novel, that's fine.

04:35.318 --> 04:35.678
Okay.

04:35.758 --> 04:38.462
I promise you I will complete it.

04:38.482 --> 04:39.183
No, I trust you, I trust you.

04:39.503 --> 04:41.506
I don't write these stories unless I have.

04:41.766 --> 04:45.812
No, what I was referring to is that they were, and I don't want to ruin it for,

04:46.096 --> 04:49.800
You know, you were other readers, but there is a rape scene.

04:50.360 --> 04:54.505
And that was very difficult to write.

04:54.745 --> 04:56.226
Was that part of the original scheme?

04:56.246 --> 04:57.488
Oh, absolutely.

04:57.508 --> 04:59.710
So you had this thing pretty well figured out.

04:59.950 --> 05:00.791
I'm a lazy writer.

05:00.991 --> 05:03.774
I don't like doing second, third, and fourth drafts.

05:04.155 --> 05:07.258
I find that tedium beyond belief.

05:07.278 --> 05:11.102
So I don't even start until every day.

05:11.122 --> 05:11.442
Yeah.

05:11.622 --> 05:11.943
Really?

05:11.983 --> 05:12.323
Yeah.

05:12.573 --> 05:18.810
It drives my students crazy because they want to kill me because I'm always making them go back and do it and do it.

05:18.830 --> 05:27.814
But temperamentally, I would rather hold it all together in my mind for four or five years and go through.

05:28.115 --> 05:32.659
Because I write longhand, and so I create, it's a messy process to do rewrites.

05:32.679 --> 05:36.623
So is 1989 just happens to be when you started writing the book?

05:36.963 --> 05:39.505
No, I had to wait for all of that to filter down.

05:40.046 --> 05:42.448
I really only started it about a year and a half ago.

05:42.608 --> 05:44.410
Well, you mentioned five years.

05:44.710 --> 05:47.453
Well, yeah, and it's been longer than that.

05:47.933 --> 05:53.778
I finished John Dollar in 1988, and then I did a collection of short stories, so it takes a long time.

05:53.858 --> 05:56.721
And I also had started a novel, which I realized,

05:57.241 --> 05:58.503
I wasn't meant to write.

05:59.885 --> 06:01.387
Did you throw it away or just put it aside?

06:02.248 --> 06:06.454
Well, oh, I don't ever put anything into the fire.

06:07.095 --> 06:11.021
I just put it into the bottomless pit of the bottom drawer.

06:11.041 --> 06:18.872
I tell my students as well, nothing is ever wasted, and the characters may re-emerge.

06:19.273 --> 06:26.303
It was an 18th century novel about the writing of the Bill of Rights, and with everything that's going on in our life now,

06:26.587 --> 06:29.552
I thought, you know, if I want to write an 18th century novel, it'll wait.

06:30.233 --> 06:32.035
You know, the 18th century isn't going to go away.

06:32.095 --> 06:33.478
Nothing's going to change about it.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.441
It's already committed itself to posterity.

06:35.921 --> 06:38.846
Well, it's a different take on it, though.

06:39.927 --> 06:40.508
Yeah.

06:40.528 --> 06:41.169
Journalism.

06:41.870 --> 06:44.715
Why journalism here?

06:44.735 --> 06:47.259
Because I became... Is it a metaphor for anything?

06:47.739 --> 06:53.268
I think journalism is, if anything, things are metaphors for journalism, including post-journalism.

06:53.388 --> 06:54.670
Um...

06:55.358 --> 07:02.846
Because in February 1989, I became the news by virtue of the fact that I was married to Solomon Rushdie.

07:03.106 --> 07:04.848
I'm glad you brought it up about me.

07:04.868 --> 07:09.072
And I felt much abused by the press.

07:09.793 --> 07:21.585
And I felt that the press, particularly in England, had an attitude of its expectations of me that it created a version of me which was

07:21.970 --> 07:25.614
neither me nor even an approximation of what we were living through.

07:25.654 --> 07:30.139
Also, I felt that the press served Salman very badly.

07:30.199 --> 07:47.078
I mean, the week after the fatwa, his picture had been on the front page of every major newspaper, and people who had never heard of him to say nothing, to say no less than had never seen him, suddenly knew what, you know, people in Idaho knew what he looked like.

07:47.178 --> 07:49.260
And this is a man who

07:49.713 --> 07:52.757
whose life depends on his anonymity at this point.

07:52.818 --> 07:55.421
And I think it was immoral for the press to have done that.

07:55.682 --> 08:01.711
I think some editor somewhere should have said, my God, this man has been condemned to death.

08:01.991 --> 08:04.855
Let's do everything we can to protect his anonymity.

08:04.875 --> 08:09.802
You say some editor, but of course there were hundreds of editors making the same decisions.

08:09.943 --> 08:10.564
Oh, I knew that.

08:10.584 --> 08:13.087
I mean, and not one of them spiked his picture.

08:13.107 --> 08:15.270
I mean, if anything, it was everywhere.

08:15.571 --> 08:17.053
And now, I mean, I think you could...

08:17.236 --> 08:21.322
If a picture of Salman were to appear on the screen, you would know him.

08:21.342 --> 08:23.165
You would identify him.

08:23.265 --> 08:24.908
I think this is really immoral.

08:25.368 --> 08:37.607
I think that you've sort of taken a man who desperately needs to be able to pass through society without notice and made him an unnoticeable object.

08:39.089 --> 08:45.557
abandoned the 18th century novel and thought, I really want to write something about what's happened to the... So this is a response to that experience?

08:45.577 --> 08:45.677
Yeah.

08:45.697 --> 08:54.569
I thought, going in with a point of view, that I was angry, and I was really going to show the press.

08:54.689 --> 09:00.556
Boy, I was going to write a scathing denunciation of what the press has become.

09:01.257 --> 09:04.962
And when I started to talk to journalists, my respect and admiration...

09:05.330 --> 09:07.813
glued to them beyond measure.

09:07.833 --> 09:09.295
Oh, beyond measure up.

09:10.076 --> 09:13.020
And I find that... Was that totally unexpected for you?

09:13.241 --> 09:19.329
Yeah, well, I chose... I mean, I acknowledge the journalists who helped me with this book in the beginning of the book.

09:19.549 --> 09:23.334
And I didn't speak to people who write the tabloids.

09:23.354 --> 09:30.924
I was fortunate enough to get to know and speak to people who worked for National Public Radio, the Washington Post, the New York Times.

09:31.505 --> 09:33.548
You know, the broadsheets that are really...

09:34.051 --> 09:36.294
Class sheet.

09:37.656 --> 09:48.709
And so I spoke to really hardworking, well-respected journalists and came around to thinking that they really are front line.

09:49.530 --> 09:54.777
You're talking about, but basically you're also talking about the people in the trenches, so to speak, and not the people back there.

09:55.178 --> 10:00.163
home, making the decisions as to what picture goes above the fold.

10:00.183 --> 10:04.348
No, I actually didn't speak to any editorial people, because I wasn't writing about an editor.

10:04.788 --> 10:09.673
You know, I was writing about... But you weren't that interested in the... In the politics of it.

10:09.693 --> 10:10.814
The total process.

10:10.834 --> 10:18.823
No, because that's... I mean, I'm not, and maybe I will in future books, because that is one of the frustrations for the front-line people.

10:19.003 --> 10:21.165
So you think you will continue to write about that?

10:21.185 --> 10:22.347
This is the first of a trilogy.

10:22.827 --> 10:23.768
Oh, I didn't know that.

10:23.917 --> 10:35.793
There are two books to follow because at the end of this book, our star-crossed lovers have to disappear because one of them has implicated herself in a murder.

10:38.396 --> 10:48.169
They can either fess up and face the charges, or they can do what a great many number of people are doing, and that is go off the grid and go into hiding.

10:48.858 --> 10:51.061
You are pulling this from real life, aren't you?

10:51.261 --> 10:55.948
I am, and I'm not, because also, look, I'm bringing them back to the United States.

10:56.128 --> 10:57.870
Some may go into hiding out in South Dakota.

10:57.891 --> 11:00.714
I just was out in the Badlands all of last week.

11:00.734 --> 11:03.819
You came back to the United States.

11:03.839 --> 11:05.201
Because I needed work, Nick.

11:05.581 --> 11:07.884
I couldn't work in England.

11:07.904 --> 11:10.528
I came back to teach here.

11:11.150 --> 11:13.052
But the militia are going off the grid.

11:13.253 --> 11:23.726
I mean, it's something that... Yes, I have... I'm pulling from real life, but also I'm addressing what is an emerging movement in the United States.

11:23.947 --> 11:32.378
And they end up... Noah and Lilith end up five miles down the road from another Waco situation and are drawn inexorably back into being journalists.

11:32.398 --> 11:33.679
And that's where the second book is.

11:34.500 --> 11:40.448
And it also explores underground movements in the USA...

11:40.833 --> 11:49.783
It takes place right at the borderlines of the Badlands and the Pine Ridge Reservation, which is every year the poorest county in the United States.

11:50.305 --> 11:52.131
So I get to write about Native Americans.

11:52.171 --> 11:53.475
I get to write about...

11:53.894 --> 11:55.736
I get to write about fundamentalists.

11:55.756 --> 11:57.358
I get to write about militiamen.

11:57.698 --> 12:00.181
I get to write about gun control.

12:00.221 --> 12:05.026
I mean, the second of this— But you're becoming something of a journalist in your own right.

12:05.046 --> 12:08.209
I mean, these are issues that go beyond writing fiction.

12:08.229 --> 12:09.570
I think that that's an obligation.

12:10.031 --> 12:12.413
I'm not kind of prose writer.

12:12.714 --> 12:20.001
All my books have hung on political issues, one way or the other.

12:20.061 --> 12:21.623
I write novels of ideas.

12:21.805 --> 12:25.571
I don't write novels of discovery or writes of passion.

12:25.591 --> 12:35.167
Yeah, but you also paid... They are... I don't mean to use the word dated because... But, you know, you've set this around the complex of events.

12:36.088 --> 12:45.523
Yeah, and I think... Well, I think 1989 is a bit... Posterity will judge, but I really do think that it's not going to be... Like a 68 almost.

12:45.583 --> 12:46.665
Yeah, it's going to be...

12:46.865 --> 12:50.368
a term that refers to an entire movement.

12:50.389 --> 12:51.009
Like back in 68.

12:51.029 --> 12:53.051
Yeah, or 1492.

12:53.111 --> 12:55.153
You don't think of it as being... That's right.

12:55.173 --> 13:04.963
But even within our own compass, remembering 68... 68 means you remember Paris, you remember things that happened on the street here, you remember everything, sweeping, sweeping here.

13:04.983 --> 13:09.448
Bobby Kennedy, Martin Luther King... Brings it all up.

13:09.468 --> 13:13.952
...all these things, you know, in Vietnam and Kent State, all these things in 68.

13:14.489 --> 13:15.913
I'm sorry to go off on that.

13:16.314 --> 13:23.712
So will the succeeding volumes of the trilogy be narrated by this name?

13:23.732 --> 13:24.013
No.

13:25.336 --> 13:31.030
This one, really good question, because one thing that writing a novel teaches you is how to write

13:31.297 --> 13:32.198
how you should have written it.

13:32.719 --> 13:33.580
Too late.

13:33.600 --> 13:36.024
Well, maybe a second draft.

13:36.044 --> 13:36.905
I know, that's right.

13:36.925 --> 13:41.693
I don't want to do that, so I'll just write another one.

13:41.853 --> 13:46.520
I'll turn it into a sequel.

13:47.121 --> 13:54.492
But I had to... I wanted to write in the first person, because it's also a book about obsessive love.

13:54.552 --> 13:59.920
As much as it's about politics in 1989, it's also about love and the banality of evil.

14:00.490 --> 14:06.659
And I wanted to write very intimately and obsessively about obsessive love.

14:07.600 --> 14:13.429
And so that limited it to either writing from one of the two obsessives' point of view.

14:13.469 --> 14:20.238
And I somehow wasn't comfortable with writing from the female point of view because it's not Lilith's book.

14:20.779 --> 14:25.386
She's objectified through the man who's obsessively in love with her, through Noah.

14:26.307 --> 14:30.413
And so consequently, by the end of the book, we still don't know very much about her except that

14:30.865 --> 14:33.749
He's obsessed with her and would do anything for her.

14:34.910 --> 14:37.354
And it's limiting what I could do.

14:37.394 --> 14:39.697
I could never get really into her head.

14:40.298 --> 14:42.521
Well, the first person does do that.

14:42.621 --> 14:43.502
But we know Noah.

14:43.522 --> 14:48.629
I mean, Noah is always right here at our ear whispering the book into our minds.

14:49.530 --> 14:55.278
And so at the end of Iblis Eden, I said, you know, thank you very much, Noah John, but I don't want to be you anymore.

14:56.259 --> 14:59.163
So the second book is told in that.

14:59.223 --> 15:00.805
And my favorite voice, The Omnit,

15:01.055 --> 15:04.499
and allows me... You don't like him anymore.

15:04.519 --> 15:18.457
Oh, no, I love him desperately, but I can't tell the next part of the story through his eyes because it involves two other characters from this book that I must get inside.

15:18.678 --> 15:20.640
So it will be narrated, however?

15:21.221 --> 15:23.284
By the omnipotent narrator.

15:23.304 --> 15:24.345
Oh, so it'll be third person, then.

15:24.706 --> 15:26.207
It's definitely third person.

15:26.428 --> 15:29.712
And then the third book will be told by Lewis.

15:30.299 --> 15:30.940
That works.

15:31.281 --> 15:31.962
That works.

15:31.982 --> 15:32.283
I see that.

15:32.303 --> 15:32.744
Yeah, I can see that.

15:32.764 --> 15:37.734
Because I have a bracket in it, and if I knock wood, it'll last long enough.

15:37.854 --> 15:39.598
Well, will you have a denouement?

15:39.618 --> 15:41.602
Will there be a resolution in the third volume?

15:41.883 --> 15:44.047
Will they all be in volume three?

15:44.327 --> 15:45.590
Do you see that far ahead?

15:45.851 --> 15:52.003
That far ahead I don't see, because there's this motif in the beginning of Eveless Eden that one train may hide another.

15:52.355 --> 15:59.441
And until I get over the second one, I mean, I've got this mountain to come up.

16:00.122 --> 16:04.265
I'm not really seeing the third one clearly enough.

16:04.605 --> 16:11.992
That clearly, to me, I mean, in the very first page, is that this is a phrase that we're going to see repeatedly.

16:12.072 --> 16:13.473
Yeah, and you do.

16:14.574 --> 16:15.515
I'm sure you do.

16:15.995 --> 16:19.138
And here I am using it.

16:19.178 --> 16:21.940
Not only here, obviously, but...

16:22.358 --> 16:24.621
And two succeeding volumes, right?

16:24.641 --> 16:24.981
Yeah.

16:25.102 --> 16:25.602
Interesting.

16:26.203 --> 16:31.911
Because I didn't know that this was going to happen until... You didn't conceive of a trilogy?

16:32.552 --> 16:33.713
Not originally.

16:34.174 --> 16:37.458
So you thought this would... This would pretty much tie it all up.

16:37.859 --> 16:41.323
And then I realized it doesn't.

16:41.343 --> 16:42.585
At what point do you realize that?

16:42.745 --> 16:44.267
I realized it at the day no more.

16:44.287 --> 16:46.510
I realized it about two-thirds of the way through.

16:46.658 --> 16:51.266
I'm never going to have enough time to do it.

16:51.326 --> 16:51.867
It's impossible.

16:51.987 --> 16:59.340
I can either write an 100-page book or I can deliver on time and turn it into a trilogy.

17:00.001 --> 17:01.444
And also characters came out.

17:01.464 --> 17:10.480
I didn't really know that there were two supporting characters in this book who become pivotal to the story, to the succeeding story.

17:10.500 --> 17:11.822
They announce themselves to you?

17:12.173 --> 17:13.114
They really did.

17:13.134 --> 17:16.720
They say, you're not done with me.

17:16.740 --> 17:20.826
Yeah, it's not like I open the closet and they go, ah!

17:20.846 --> 17:20.906
No.

17:21.466 --> 17:29.718
But they have become necessary for the resolution to take place that needs to take place.

17:29.759 --> 17:31.982
The ultimate resolution.

17:32.002 --> 17:33.284
The ultimate resolution.

17:33.444 --> 17:37.089
And how far forward in time do you expect to come?

17:37.109 --> 17:39.733
I'll probably go... Well, I don't know...

17:40.557 --> 17:43.900
What's going to happen is that I'm writing on the cusp of events.

17:43.940 --> 17:48.085
So whenever I finish the book, and I don't write science fiction, I write into the future.

17:48.105 --> 17:51.068
So you're almost like a jazz musician.

17:51.188 --> 17:52.269
You will improvise it.

17:52.289 --> 17:54.031
As long as a piece of string, yeah.

17:54.751 --> 17:57.334
And what my heartbeat is.

17:58.395 --> 17:58.916
That's cool.

17:59.036 --> 17:59.676
I like that.

17:59.736 --> 18:01.598
To follow that out.

18:01.738 --> 18:04.541
So as things happen... They'll go into the book.

18:04.681 --> 18:07.324
You reserve...

18:07.473 --> 18:19.491
I mean, if suddenly there's a, you know, if suddenly there's a militia of Michigan take over the state capital, I mean, clearly that's going to be an important part, because I'm writing about militias.

18:19.591 --> 18:22.456
But, I mean, this train sabotage thing was just a couple of days ago.

18:22.496 --> 18:23.637
I'm sure you're alert to that.

18:23.657 --> 18:25.901
I know, but they haven't, yeah, they haven't pinned that down.

18:25.941 --> 18:27.203
Yeah, but it's interesting.

18:27.664 --> 18:30.728
What's interesting is they're checking the mailing list of a magazine.

18:30.748 --> 18:31.610
Yep.

18:31.630 --> 18:34.594
There's such a story, you know...

18:34.912 --> 18:39.336
I think they've solved my own sense of investigative procedures.

18:39.936 --> 18:41.838
These people are as smart as they think they are.

18:42.339 --> 18:45.201
I don't mean to go off on that.

18:45.221 --> 18:49.325
No, I know, but that's frightening because the same thing can usually be said of politicians.

18:49.705 --> 18:52.047
But you're alert to things like this.

18:52.508 --> 19:03.197
Oh, I think that, you know, Vonnegut said that the writers are the canaries in the miner's cage that were the first to die if there was methane gas loose in the shaft.

19:03.700 --> 19:13.490
And I think anticipating where history is going is part of the gamble and, for me, part of the excitement.

19:14.431 --> 19:27.885
Because I did write a book that was set in 1917 and realized the frustrations of writing period pieces, that I had to be very, very careful that I wasn't including anachronisms

19:28.388 --> 19:31.895
that the language couldn't be riffy and jazzy and modern.

19:31.935 --> 19:37.505
And I can be a funny person.

19:38.006 --> 19:43.236
I have to try to be grown up most of the time, not the funny person that I naturally am.

19:44.058 --> 19:49.468
And I find it easier to write in present time, in real time.

19:50.022 --> 19:55.248
at least I'm having an awful lot of fun for the foreseeable future, and then I can always go back to the 18th century.

19:55.588 --> 19:59.372
Talk to me a little bit about the biblical... Allusions.

19:59.473 --> 19:59.873
Allusions.

20:00.374 --> 20:03.777
Well, Bible stories were my first myth.

20:04.058 --> 20:05.980
My father was a fundamentalist Christian.

20:06.460 --> 20:07.321
Oh, great.

20:07.341 --> 20:09.604
Oh, you're from Pennsylvania, right?

20:09.724 --> 20:10.705
Lancaster.

20:10.725 --> 20:11.646
Yeah.

20:11.666 --> 20:13.008
And my mother is Greek Orthodox.

20:13.088 --> 20:14.269
And I'm Greek Orthodox.

20:14.289 --> 20:14.669
Hey!

20:17.192 --> 20:17.733
Vesbanes.

20:17.753 --> 20:19.675
Vesbanes is a Greek name, of course.

20:20.077 --> 20:23.860
I read that in your PW interview, as a matter of fact.

20:24.020 --> 20:26.402
I had something to talk about at some point.

20:26.482 --> 20:27.744
Golly, that was a long time ago.

20:27.764 --> 20:28.244
Who did that?

20:28.264 --> 20:29.905
Michelle Field did that, didn't she?

20:30.186 --> 20:31.707
Yeah, I keep a photo.

20:32.828 --> 20:34.649
I was hoping to talk to you in Greek.

20:34.770 --> 20:37.232
In Greek, I couldn't do it.

20:37.292 --> 20:39.674
My daughter is my Greek, thank goodness.

20:40.935 --> 20:41.996
But anyway, I'm sorry.

20:42.056 --> 20:43.477
You're talking about your fundamentalist.

20:43.517 --> 20:44.478
Yeah, well, I never came.

20:45.339 --> 20:46.339
Well, a lot of things.

20:46.359 --> 20:49.442
I was supposed to interview Salman on the Santa Claus system.

20:49.827 --> 20:53.312
I still have the file on that.

20:53.332 --> 20:54.814
That's very collectible, isn't it?

20:54.834 --> 20:56.056
Well, he'd appreciate it.

20:56.076 --> 20:56.817
You should do it.

20:56.877 --> 21:06.251
Yes, so I had these two alternate... Fundamentalist's file and background Bible stories.

21:06.271 --> 21:07.192
And the panagia.

21:07.833 --> 21:12.920
So I had all of this kind of... You said that very well, yeah.

21:12.940 --> 21:15.664
So I think that I keep going back to those references.

21:15.965 --> 21:19.530
And I never was comfortable with The Myth of Ede.

21:20.168 --> 21:23.712
And I think if you'd ask your daughters, they'd tell you the same thing.

21:23.792 --> 21:29.918
I mean, I chaped against that mantle of responsibility for tempting Adam to eat of the fruit.

21:29.938 --> 21:32.100
You know, give me a break.

21:32.701 --> 21:49.838
And at a certain point, I can't even remember when, I found it exhilarating when I stumbled on the Talmudic reference to Lilith that there had been a woman before Eve who was not blonde and not passive.

21:50.223 --> 21:54.728
but was a dark, ferocious kind of equal to Adam.

21:55.730 --> 21:59.174
And the legend is, Adam said, wait a minute.

21:59.835 --> 22:02.017
This isn't going to work.

22:02.057 --> 22:02.658
This is Agno.

22:02.678 --> 22:03.980
This is not what I had in mind.

22:04.260 --> 22:06.583
You put me in Eden and then you give me this.

22:07.524 --> 22:09.086
I want a shiksa.

22:09.146 --> 22:14.172
Give me something blonde, please.

22:14.312 --> 22:18.137
And so Lilith was banished to a cave by the seaside.

22:18.505 --> 22:25.332
And the myth is that she still can steal the souls of young male children.

22:25.352 --> 22:26.633
It's a great myth.

22:26.653 --> 22:27.414
Oh, it's terrific stuff.

22:27.434 --> 22:30.597
Where's that book been all these years?

22:31.318 --> 22:32.199
In the Talmud.

22:32.219 --> 22:34.821
What a great literary... Yeah, it's irresistible.

22:37.103 --> 22:43.770
I think the only reason that most people know the name is that there is a character on Cheers.

22:44.915 --> 22:49.803
who was a dark-haired, ball-busting psychoanalist.

22:50.164 --> 22:53.850
All the Liliths are these kind of ball-busting women.

22:54.611 --> 23:10.618
And I suppose, to a certain extent, my Lilith is very daunting because she's ferocious and brave and takes a lot of risks and incomparable at her job and puts her job before...

23:10.767 --> 23:20.201
her heart, which is not the accepted cultural reference for women.

23:20.341 --> 23:27.932
With all of these little things in place, what I like to do is to take archetypes or archetypal narratives

23:28.942 --> 23:32.767
And lay down layers and layers and layers and layers.

23:32.807 --> 23:50.190
So as the reader is reading, these little mind explosions are going off because you've got all of these references and the written word now has been recorded and anthologized for 2,000, 4,000 years.

23:50.575 --> 23:54.819
So we can go back and load every sentence with a cultural reference.

23:54.859 --> 24:06.610
And I think this not only places the reader in the intimate act of reading, but also places the reader in time.

24:06.630 --> 24:14.217
So that if you cite historical references, you're placing the reader in space and time, and yet freeing the mind.

24:14.738 --> 24:17.160
And it's just part of the beauty of writing.

24:17.180 --> 24:19.502
And if I know enough stories,

24:19.803 --> 24:22.406
about history and if I know enough about legends.

24:23.547 --> 24:27.812
I love planting, you know, double entendre, triple entendre if I can.

24:28.553 --> 24:31.877
I think that that's, you know, that's the monkey puzzle of it.

24:31.897 --> 24:33.239
That's the fun of it.

24:33.259 --> 24:37.544
You don't see the novel as any kind of a fable or anything like that.

24:37.564 --> 24:40.948
Sure, all novels, all stories are, to a certain extent, fabulous.

24:42.610 --> 24:43.050
Or not.

24:43.110 --> 24:48.156
I mean, Brett Easton Ellis is still, you know, who writes fables.

24:48.457 --> 24:53.905
even if he's writing at, you know, zero gravity.

24:54.606 --> 24:58.071
It's just, no, it's not a reinvention.

24:58.131 --> 24:59.473
And I think of all writers.

24:59.533 --> 25:03.318
I mean, Shakespeare rewrote all those old stories.

25:03.358 --> 25:04.880
We've been doing it forever.

25:05.361 --> 25:09.086
Well, you know, I have a book, Saxo Germanicus.

25:09.286 --> 25:09.827
You know, he is.

25:09.847 --> 25:10.588
He wrote the original.

25:10.889 --> 25:13.853
It was a Hamlet 50 years before the Hamlet.

25:13.873 --> 25:14.654
Before the Hamlet.

25:14.674 --> 25:15.375
And so...

25:15.676 --> 25:21.064
It's basically a revenge play, which is what Hamlet is.

25:21.084 --> 25:25.751
She took a play that wasn't even 30 or 40 years old and did a re-spin of it.

25:25.812 --> 25:26.793
Postmodern.

25:27.053 --> 25:28.696
That's right.

25:28.716 --> 25:31.260
That's exactly right.

25:31.280 --> 25:31.721
How do you write?

25:31.741 --> 25:33.503
Do you write a word processor, a longhand?

25:34.325 --> 25:34.865
Lucky pen.

25:36.228 --> 25:37.209
Really?

25:39.412 --> 25:40.374
No, I'm not a mot blanc.

25:40.434 --> 25:41.235
I'm a waterman.

25:41.255 --> 25:42.056
Oh, that's a waterman.

25:42.157 --> 25:44.400
Yeah.

25:44.752 --> 25:48.618
which I've been using ever since I lived in Paris.

25:49.620 --> 25:55.689
I lost my train of thought there, Nick.

25:55.709 --> 25:56.390
That's okay.

25:56.631 --> 26:02.039
I went in my mind to Paris, and then I thought, oh, I would very much rather be in Paris than along the Charleston.

26:02.059 --> 26:03.181
But what was the question?

26:03.201 --> 26:03.782
I don't know.

26:03.802 --> 26:05.885
You were writing in longhand, that's right.

26:05.985 --> 26:08.770
Actually, as I'm writing the book, I'm creating the book.

26:08.850 --> 26:11.794
I'm creating a novel of my own, because I write in big notebooks.

26:12.155 --> 26:12.295
Mm-hmm.

26:12.747 --> 26:14.489
And it's really one shot.

26:14.509 --> 26:15.390
It's one shot.

26:15.410 --> 26:19.113
I mean, you know, there's daily revisions, but it's one.

26:19.754 --> 26:23.037
And then when I move to the typewriter, I polish.

26:23.057 --> 26:24.058
Well, that's a second graph.

26:25.079 --> 26:25.360
Is it?

26:25.960 --> 26:27.622
Well, there's a variant.

26:27.642 --> 26:28.203
It's refining.

26:28.223 --> 26:30.185
Yeah, it's refining.

26:30.285 --> 26:38.553
If we were to examine the text of the manuscript to the typescript, there would be differences?

26:38.593 --> 26:41.556
There would be line editing, but not...

26:42.127 --> 26:44.169
Not structural assumptions and things?

26:44.189 --> 26:45.571
No, no.

26:45.591 --> 26:46.392
In fact, I don't.

26:47.473 --> 26:49.195
I don't do very much of that at all.

26:49.616 --> 26:50.797
I don't take a wrong turn.

26:50.817 --> 26:55.923
I mean, this book is structured in six concise pieces.

26:56.344 --> 27:02.652
I knew I wanted a photograph at the beginning of every chapter, which you noticed.

27:02.672 --> 27:04.113
They did very nicely for me.

27:04.354 --> 27:05.315
They found those for you?

27:05.375 --> 27:06.016
Oh, no, they're mine.

27:06.396 --> 27:09.179
Four of them are mine, and two of them are my daughter's.

27:09.380 --> 27:10.961
My daughter is a professional photographer.

27:11.062 --> 27:11.442
Oh, great.

27:11.708 --> 27:26.990
And we were going to actually make them, pretend them to be Liliths, and we were going to use an Agence France-Presse logo here, but Agence France-Presse wouldn't let us do it, and it just got too complicated.

27:27.050 --> 27:30.995
And also, she's a better photographer than I am, so we didn't credit them at all.

27:31.476 --> 27:35.782
But I wanted, I mean, I take... It makes sense that they were Liliths, isn't that funny?

27:35.802 --> 27:37.384
Oh, ah, you bought it.

27:38.386 --> 27:38.486
Yeah.

27:38.506 --> 27:38.726
Good.

27:38.746 --> 27:40.208
I mean, that's the whole point.

27:40.228 --> 27:40.829
It just makes sense.

27:41.149 --> 27:41.530
Yeah.

27:41.763 --> 27:42.984
I think that's the idea.

27:43.004 --> 27:43.104
Yeah.

27:43.745 --> 27:45.327
And I happen to have been lucky enough.

27:45.367 --> 27:47.109
I mean, that's my photograph of the wall.

27:47.890 --> 27:49.712
I happen to have been there.

27:50.733 --> 27:51.374
Not happened.

27:51.414 --> 27:51.854
I went.

27:52.495 --> 27:53.636
I mean, why else are they there?

27:53.656 --> 27:57.460
It makes sense to me that that's why we have these photographs here.

27:57.681 --> 27:58.762
She's a photographer.

27:58.782 --> 27:59.002
Absolutely.

27:59.222 --> 28:03.247
So, I mean, I take really special care.

28:03.267 --> 28:07.071
And even when I was in my notebook, I had running heads.

28:07.972 --> 28:10.715
I've put running heads at the top of every page here, too.

28:10.735 --> 28:11.736
You're kidding.

28:12.273 --> 28:13.935
I've never heard of anybody that does that.

28:14.116 --> 28:15.357
You're pointing heads in your notebook.

28:15.558 --> 28:15.998
Yeah.

28:16.579 --> 28:20.104
I planned the book to look like this.

28:21.526 --> 28:28.296
So the physical notebook has... You actually are visualizing the printed book.

28:28.316 --> 28:34.765
Obviously, it didn't work out that way because the print is different than my manuscript page and is different than the type page.

28:34.785 --> 28:35.647
But I mean, you've had it.

28:35.667 --> 28:36.848
Yeah.

28:36.868 --> 28:37.369
Because I...

28:37.855 --> 28:43.581
Because I'm such a perfectionist when it comes to creating that whole world of the novel.

28:44.282 --> 28:51.910
And I really wanted this to be a feast for the reader in every way, including the trim size.

28:51.990 --> 28:54.833
I'm not crazy about this cover.

28:55.554 --> 28:59.078
I think it's a little harsh.

28:59.098 --> 29:03.643
Well, but it also gives you an image of the woman that maybe you weren't

29:04.062 --> 29:06.344
But that's so not like her.

29:06.364 --> 29:07.885
So you don't see her?

29:07.905 --> 29:08.666
That's not how you see her?

29:08.686 --> 29:11.788
No, she would never wear lipstick.

29:11.809 --> 29:12.669
She would never, ever.

29:12.689 --> 29:13.410
Well, did you complain?

29:14.711 --> 29:20.156
You know, when it comes to doing the covers, I think that that's where the book people know more than me.

29:20.256 --> 29:21.357
I mean, that's their business.

29:22.217 --> 29:23.598
I'm on the inside.

29:23.638 --> 29:25.000
That's my business.

29:25.560 --> 29:30.344
But when it comes to the rap, they do hundreds of these a year.

29:30.384 --> 29:32.906
They know... There's been marketing studies.

29:32.926 --> 29:33.867
Yeah, so I...

29:34.100 --> 29:37.527
You know, I'm a little outclassed when it comes to that.

29:37.648 --> 29:40.594
And maybe they know something we don't know about lipstick.

29:40.794 --> 29:45.023
Women without lipstick on covers maybe... So I always capitulate.

29:45.043 --> 29:47.008
I always ask for cover approval.

29:48.852 --> 29:51.417
But I think they know what they're doing better than I do.

29:51.785 --> 29:56.270
I think if I were to attempt to design the outside of a book, I'd be a massive failure.

29:56.290 --> 30:01.957
I have to say, I don't want to talk about my own book, which is out now, but I absolutely picked the art for the cover.

30:02.037 --> 30:02.478
Did you?

30:03.319 --> 30:03.699
Tell me.

30:03.859 --> 30:12.750
I do have a computer, which I use for script writing or for nonfiction.

30:13.551 --> 30:18.957
But I need, and I also write with an ink pen.

30:19.578 --> 30:22.081
on heavy paper.

30:22.101 --> 30:23.382
I mean, I need that.

30:23.402 --> 30:24.603
Oh, there's a tactile thing for you.

30:24.623 --> 30:25.404
Yeah, there's a tactile thing.

30:25.424 --> 30:26.625
Really, you do feel it.

30:26.645 --> 30:29.508
And I don't feel it, particularly the little clip.

30:29.528 --> 30:30.269
I have a laptop.

30:32.251 --> 30:33.492
You don't feel anything.

30:33.512 --> 30:34.833
You don't feel the words coming out.

30:35.774 --> 30:38.537
And so I need to, and listen, it's worked.

30:38.677 --> 30:40.339
I've written seven books.

30:40.359 --> 30:41.060
Why mess with it?

30:41.600 --> 30:44.063
I don't remember when Updike, remember when Updike, I remember.

30:44.363 --> 30:46.485
It's like something that occurred in my life.

30:47.066 --> 30:49.348
Updike moved to computers, and all of a sudden,

30:49.953 --> 30:52.016
He seemed to be writing more, which was a joy.

30:52.116 --> 30:56.063
I mean, let's face it.

30:56.223 --> 31:00.509
But he did!

31:00.730 --> 31:02.052
Books get longer, I think.

31:02.132 --> 31:11.807
But the awful thing is a lot of bad not-updyke writers are writing more, too, because of the ease of... It's so easy to insert things, to move things around.

31:11.927 --> 31:13.089
I mean, change.

31:13.309 --> 31:14.351
And I'm a perfectionist.

31:14.411 --> 31:16.955
If a page has a mistake on it, I'll throw it away.

31:16.975 --> 31:18.137
I like clean copy.

31:18.792 --> 31:23.016
But with the computer, you can make your corrections.

31:23.036 --> 31:27.441
And there's no way of knowing how many drafts there are, you know, because you do that.

31:27.461 --> 31:28.442
Well, that's the other thing.

31:28.542 --> 31:32.126
I mean, I can see, the poem says, I can see the cross out.

31:32.787 --> 31:37.812
If you've been to, I don't know if you've been to London, but the British Museum has the manuscript room.

31:38.292 --> 31:39.434
It's in my book.

31:39.454 --> 31:39.734
I describe it.

31:39.754 --> 31:40.214
Of course.

31:40.274 --> 31:41.516
Of course you would.

31:41.556 --> 31:42.577
Of course you would.

31:42.597 --> 31:45.660
I describe, you know, and I go to that,

31:46.113 --> 31:52.180
case one where you have the Beowulf and the, you know, that was just saved by a guy.

31:52.200 --> 31:53.741
Why do you take the magnifying glass?

31:53.842 --> 31:55.764
I mean, you can see the thought process.

31:55.784 --> 32:02.811
Well, while you're here, you should really try to get over to Harvard at the Houghton Library where they have a Keats exhibition.

32:03.212 --> 32:09.158
And to see, I get the greatest kick out of seeing, unfortunately, looking at the chaplain's home with his hand.

32:09.259 --> 32:10.620
You know, I mean, I do get it.

32:11.141 --> 32:14.444
You get the same thing in the British Library when you see these manuscripts.

32:14.464 --> 32:16.086
I think that's what you were talking about there.

32:16.420 --> 32:20.645
And you can read, you can hear the rhythm of the line being created.

32:20.665 --> 32:23.929
And that's maybe old-fashioned.

32:24.009 --> 32:28.355
It certainly is not an efficient use of time.

32:29.156 --> 32:31.178
I think for you it is, though.

32:31.619 --> 32:32.280
For me it is.

32:32.320 --> 32:36.505
I mean, if you do it once through, it's...

32:37.160 --> 32:39.403
Well, what's a good day for you?

32:39.584 --> 32:40.806
Do you count words?

32:41.086 --> 32:41.747
Do you impose?

32:41.887 --> 32:42.969
No, that's a guy thing.

32:43.670 --> 32:44.191
See, I do.

32:44.211 --> 32:46.514
I have to, because I'm an old newspaper man.

32:46.734 --> 32:48.778
And I need deadlines.

32:48.818 --> 32:55.708
You know, that explains to me, because I always thought Hemingway did it because he was desperate to continue.

32:56.161 --> 32:59.568
to convince himself that he was still virile and productive.

32:59.588 --> 33:05.078
I mean, he was standing up and counting words, and sometimes there were only 500 words at the end of the day.

33:05.339 --> 33:07.804
And he would make it a heroic thing.

33:08.525 --> 33:11.972
Oh, see, that's the difference between... The computer will count for you.

33:12.132 --> 33:13.936
I'll tell you precisely how many you've done.

33:13.956 --> 33:17.663
And depending on how cramped my handwriting is, I mean, I have a sense of...

33:17.947 --> 33:24.138
Well, a number of pages, you must have an idea of how many pages you've done.

33:24.158 --> 33:40.849
A day isn't necessarily the number of pages, but the sense of a completed scene, or knowing that sometimes scenes take a week or more to write, or the sense that the scene is progressing, it's taking shape in the manner in which I...

33:40.981 --> 33:47.692
I mean, it's a much more subtle sense of accomplishment than a, you know, a qualitative one as opposed to a quantitative one.

33:47.712 --> 33:50.196
Do you wake up in the morning with solutions to puzzles?

33:50.556 --> 33:51.938
It happens in my sleep.

33:51.979 --> 34:07.343
That's what I'm saying, but do you actually do... If I've got, yeah, if I've got, I don't dream, but if I, because I think I have such, I have a such richly waking dream life that I probably, I mean, I don't dream unless I,

34:07.930 --> 34:13.798
This last week, I was on the road so much in South Dakota, I found that I was having processing.

34:13.838 --> 34:15.020
South Dakota?

34:15.240 --> 34:17.183
Yeah, I was in the Badlands researching this.

34:17.203 --> 34:18.585
Oh, say that on tour.

34:18.825 --> 34:19.627
No, no, no.

34:19.647 --> 34:21.549
I didn't like the tour without the South Dakota.

34:21.669 --> 34:23.532
Marianne Wiggins appearing at Wall Drug.

34:25.755 --> 34:25.815
No.

34:25.835 --> 34:28.259
Okay, all right.

34:29.441 --> 34:34.748
I work out, I've been fortunate in that way, and another reason my students

34:36.938 --> 34:52.658
want to kill me, is that I know if I've got a problem, I can pretty much count on it being worked out when I wake in the morning or within 48 hours, if it's just a technical problem.

34:54.260 --> 34:56.263
My morning is the best time to work.

34:57.121 --> 35:00.165
See, I have to impose it.

35:00.225 --> 35:01.006
It's a guy thing.

35:01.026 --> 35:04.351
It really is, I guess, but it's also a... Well, no, you answered it.

35:04.471 --> 35:10.960
It's a much more journalist thing than a guy thing, and I'm glad that... I think it was a really prejudicial point of view.

35:10.980 --> 35:18.229
It does not work with any number of women who really have to have that sense of deadline, and it really does force me... I wish I did.

35:18.530 --> 35:19.832
See, I do a column every week.

35:20.933 --> 35:26.841
I've got about 25 papers to take it, which is nice, and I put this little syndicate together myself...

35:27.361 --> 35:28.662
And my wife goes nuts.

35:28.682 --> 35:29.904
She says, why can't you get ahead?

35:30.104 --> 35:31.225
Why can't you get one ahead?

35:32.166 --> 35:35.769
And why do we always have to do this Tuesday morning?

35:35.789 --> 35:37.972
You know, the first one is due at noon on Tuesday.

35:38.052 --> 35:40.754
Why are you always pushing it to 5 to 12?

35:41.295 --> 35:42.356
I say, it's my best stuff.

35:42.456 --> 35:44.618
I mean, it can't be your best stuff.

35:44.638 --> 35:45.739
It is my best stuff.

35:45.759 --> 35:51.625
But for some reason, you know, I start to get nervous about 9, 9.30 in the morning.

35:52.506 --> 35:53.127
I work on it.

35:53.147 --> 35:57.351
Of course, I've already transcribed the tapes, and I've read the books by this time, and I know what I'm doing.

35:57.584 --> 36:08.258
But for some reason, I love this exploration of how that works.

36:08.678 --> 36:10.060
I just like to sweat a little bit.

36:10.120 --> 36:11.141
Physically, I feel it.

36:11.302 --> 36:14.205
For me, it is chilling.

36:14.265 --> 36:16.688
It immobilizes me.

36:17.049 --> 36:22.596
Maybe this is my particular problem with authority.

36:23.251 --> 36:25.793
I don't keep deadlines.

36:26.094 --> 36:26.875
I do everything.

36:26.935 --> 36:27.755
I paint the house.

36:27.795 --> 36:28.376
I vacuum.

36:28.396 --> 36:29.237
I vacuum.

36:29.918 --> 36:31.719
I decide to take off macrame.

36:32.160 --> 36:39.447
I do everything, but I'm going to miss that deadline, and I'm going to fuck authority, and I'm going to just say no, and all of that.

36:39.507 --> 36:40.468
I'm always late.

36:41.949 --> 36:44.852
I'm always in time.

36:45.252 --> 36:47.535
I hate to be late.

36:47.555 --> 36:49.917
I have friends who consistently get work.

36:50.268 --> 36:51.710
Because they meet their deadlines.

36:52.311 --> 37:00.122
And I have this terrible reputation that you're going to get this, you know, really beautifully written piece, but, you know, like six months after it was due.

37:00.142 --> 37:01.785
When it's ready.

37:01.825 --> 37:02.506
Yeah.

37:02.526 --> 37:04.929
No story before it's time, right?

37:05.671 --> 37:08.715
And I would much rather be of your ilk.

37:09.488 --> 37:11.592
It's just discipline, I guess.

37:11.692 --> 37:15.298
But, you know, you're a fiction writer, and I'm a non-fiction writer, too.

37:15.318 --> 37:24.273
And I think that that shows... I think that the beginnings show... I mean, a lot of people... Faye Weldon used to work in advertising, as did Salman.

37:25.034 --> 37:34.230
And I think their ability to find the catchphrase, the pun...

37:35.358 --> 37:45.027
shows, I mean, I think they came, not, I mean, there's no denigration attached to that, but I think that where you used to work sort of comes through.

37:45.047 --> 38:04.504
One thing I've taught myself since I left, because I don't work for a newspaper, so I have to set up my own arbitrary artificial deadlines, but they work for me, you know, is if I can make myself get something a day or two, done a day or two, ahead of when it's supposed to be done,

38:04.771 --> 38:06.032
I'm revising it.

38:06.113 --> 38:06.713
I can't make it.

38:07.154 --> 38:09.456
It always is a better story.

38:09.617 --> 38:11.959
Oh, it always is a better story?

38:11.979 --> 38:13.041
It always is, yeah.

38:13.381 --> 38:14.562
Ah.

38:14.602 --> 38:23.813
Just if I have that last shot, I do like to go through, I think, one final time and scrub it up a little bit with a few paragraphs around it.

38:24.734 --> 38:28.939
And if you are writing really fast on deadline, you do tend to...

38:29.712 --> 38:30.734
use the same words.

38:31.295 --> 38:31.855
I hate that.

38:31.875 --> 38:32.376
I hate to repeat.

38:32.777 --> 38:35.161
And you don't have somebody on the desk because you're reading it?

38:35.421 --> 38:36.763
My wife reads for me.

38:36.843 --> 38:38.686
I would do a hard copy for her.

38:38.706 --> 38:40.089
She's a good editor, got a good eye.

38:40.449 --> 38:40.890
Great.

38:40.990 --> 38:42.252
Challenging me on things.

38:42.833 --> 38:44.876
And I do like to read aloud certain things.

38:45.918 --> 38:47.601
I notice you have bookmarks in there.

38:47.621 --> 38:48.502
Are these for readings?

38:48.903 --> 38:49.003
Yeah.

38:49.287 --> 38:53.152
Are you ever tempted when you're reading to edit yourself?

38:53.232 --> 38:54.313
Do you ever change things?

38:54.353 --> 38:58.999
Yeah, because one thing I've learned about, and I'm a good performer, I'm not playing my own horn, but I really am.

38:59.820 --> 39:04.385
A lot of writers, most fiction writers are not.

39:05.907 --> 39:08.190
I mean, they drone on or whatever.

39:08.690 --> 39:11.734
And the one thing that I've learned is that what might work on the page is

39:12.423 --> 39:14.767
needs to be... I mean, of course I do.

39:15.067 --> 39:18.353
I mean, that phrase was too long, that phrase was too long.

39:19.014 --> 39:22.299
I give myself little diction hints.

39:22.379 --> 39:24.142
That doesn't work if read aloud.

39:24.923 --> 39:29.411
I mean, I make it into... You actually make quite a few changes.

39:29.571 --> 39:30.713
There are a lot of annotations.

39:30.833 --> 39:35.000
Yeah, because I have to... This particular sketch has a lot of dialogue.

39:35.701 --> 39:37.684
And so I've got to use the funny voices.

39:37.844 --> 39:38.886
I've got to be...

39:38.950 --> 39:40.232
Oh, that's great.

39:40.472 --> 39:41.674
These various people.

39:41.734 --> 39:51.868
And so I write myself, basically these are script notes, to remind the performer, this says, sing this line to me.

39:52.248 --> 40:01.701
So while I'm coming down, so I don't... There aren't that many authors who have this degree of confidence.

40:01.861 --> 40:02.462
There aren't.

40:02.823 --> 40:04.665
I mean, I know this for a fact.

40:04.685 --> 40:07.489
And I also know, I also can feel...

40:08.650 --> 40:12.135
I can feel the room hanging on every word.

40:12.215 --> 40:15.260
I mean, I can... This paragraph needed to be entirely cut.

40:15.280 --> 40:15.681
So, yes.

40:16.141 --> 40:17.423
How do you feel about performing?

40:18.004 --> 40:18.485
I love it.

40:18.745 --> 40:19.767
I love that aspect.

40:19.787 --> 40:23.112
See, that goes 180 degrees from some other... Sure.

40:23.332 --> 40:29.361
I mean, I... You believe that there should be a... You know, the reader in the book is a one-on-one thing.

40:30.063 --> 40:30.924
It can be both.

40:30.944 --> 40:36.312
I mean, I would... Given the choice, I would always take a reader over...

40:37.169 --> 40:39.232
Over the opportunity to stand up.

40:39.592 --> 40:40.453
Yeah.

40:40.473 --> 40:40.894
Always.

40:41.094 --> 40:49.004
I mean, if they said, listen, you can publish books until you drop, but you're never going to be able to read in public again.

40:49.785 --> 40:50.126
Fine.

40:50.486 --> 40:51.848
Okay.

40:51.908 --> 40:54.071
Okay.

40:55.112 --> 40:57.856
You know, that's nothing to negotiate.

41:00.159 --> 41:02.442
But I think that there's another aspect.

41:02.962 --> 41:06.467
I like not to be a public person.

41:07.628 --> 41:09.310
And most of the time, I'm not.

41:09.390 --> 41:22.248
Most of the time, I'm in a room with four walls, seeing no one, not really getting out of my sweatpants ever, with no social life that takes me away from the book or out of the book.

41:22.308 --> 41:34.986
So these few times when I can go from city to city to city and sell this stuff or just kind of be in public sort of carries through

41:35.557 --> 41:37.520
the enormous periods of isolation.

41:37.560 --> 41:43.628
When you go from city to city to city, are you essentially meeting who you perceive to be your readers?

41:46.072 --> 41:57.447
Mostly I meet, well, when I'm doing a reading, I presume that the people who are in the audience are people who care about books.

41:57.487 --> 42:00.231
They've made the effort to come to a bookstore, and

42:00.430 --> 42:08.462
And yes, what happens is they bring their old books of mine, or they've followed me on, you know, they've been reading me for years.

42:08.843 --> 42:10.926
So yes is the answer to that.

42:11.167 --> 42:18.017
But on book tours, the majority of people that I talk to are people that my press officer has

42:18.419 --> 42:22.544
set up for me to have a conversation, which is an unreal conversation.

42:22.564 --> 42:28.191
I mean, were we to meet outside the context of this, we wouldn't be talking at such great length about Iblas Eden.

42:28.211 --> 42:32.496
We'd be talking about what a kick it was to come from a Greek Orthodox family, right?

42:32.516 --> 42:33.277
That's right.

42:33.618 --> 42:35.840
And the fact that my wife happens to be Greek.

42:36.341 --> 42:37.683
Of course she is.

42:37.903 --> 42:39.685
That never happens.

42:40.019 --> 42:42.061
third generation Greek-American marrying.

42:42.241 --> 42:42.721
Oh, yeah.

42:42.862 --> 42:43.582
Oh, got it.

42:43.622 --> 42:46.245
That's my brother's wife is Unitarian.

42:46.265 --> 42:47.105
That's more like it.

42:47.586 --> 42:48.487
That's the norm.

42:48.567 --> 42:52.590
Paul Tsongas' wife is, you know, he's a real professional Greek.

42:52.610 --> 42:56.013
And there's Nick Gage, who's a very good friend of mine, and the neighbor, you know, Nicholas Gage.

42:56.234 --> 42:57.074
I know his work.

42:57.335 --> 43:01.558
Do you know Stratus Javier is here?

43:01.679 --> 43:03.640
I know Stratus very well, yeah.

43:03.700 --> 43:07.544
Because I thought that the Greek book was When the Tree Sings.

43:07.564 --> 43:08.845
That's a wonderful book.

43:09.297 --> 43:15.812
knock me sideways, which takes a completely opposing view to Nick's... I've seen the two together.

43:15.852 --> 43:22.767
As a matter of fact, I think you do see that they were correct proper, but... Oh, yeah.

43:23.152 --> 43:28.219
You know, it's like you don't want to, you really shouldn't have put these people out there.

43:28.239 --> 43:30.141
Oh, Nick, I mean, you know what happened.

43:30.462 --> 43:33.586
I mean, could you have pulled your files out on these guys?

43:33.866 --> 43:36.130
But, you know, I mean, we're adults.

43:36.390 --> 43:37.672
We're civilized peoples.

43:37.732 --> 43:41.637
Oh, but I just didn't, I mean, not when it comes to, I mean, he.

43:41.677 --> 43:42.358
And neither is Nick.

43:42.438 --> 43:43.259
And neither is Nick.

43:43.419 --> 43:48.366
And to tell the truth, I think, I really think that Nick was a little over the top.

43:48.616 --> 43:50.198
but of course his mother was killed.

43:50.218 --> 43:53.863
The guy kills your mother.

43:54.144 --> 44:00.492
I think that to those individuals who say, we're going to Greece, should I read Eleni?

44:00.592 --> 44:06.320
I always say, and if you can get it when the tree sinks, because it's the other part of the story.

44:06.340 --> 44:14.792
I really didn't like, don't quote me on this, but I thought the heroic age, I thought the best thing he did, that was Stratus' second book, you know.

44:15.430 --> 44:17.352
Was that the one with the kid?

44:17.412 --> 44:18.093
That was the kid.

44:18.493 --> 44:19.894
In fact, he had a kid on the jacket.

44:20.074 --> 44:21.276
Yeah, yeah.

44:22.357 --> 44:26.681
I mean, he would go off on a tangent that we would normally be... Huh?

44:26.701 --> 44:27.441
I saw him.

44:27.962 --> 44:29.203
I haven't seen him in a while, either.

44:29.383 --> 44:30.164
I saw him.

44:30.204 --> 44:32.646
He took me completely by surprise.

44:32.947 --> 44:39.353
On my last book tour through, which was for a collection of short stories, I gave a reading somewhere in Cambridge.

44:39.373 --> 44:40.294
I don't even remember where.

44:40.374 --> 44:41.775
And he sat in the back row.

44:42.127 --> 44:43.949
shadow of his former self.

44:44.229 --> 44:44.550
Really?

44:44.710 --> 44:45.190
Really.

44:45.210 --> 44:46.011
He had this hair.

44:46.031 --> 44:46.952
He turned white.

44:47.753 --> 44:49.255
He was very pale.

44:49.275 --> 44:51.157
But he was always a former construction worker.

44:51.177 --> 44:54.981
Yeah, he always looked like he had a sponge diver or something.

44:55.541 --> 44:59.365
And a sadness that was unshakable.

44:59.806 --> 45:01.007
Oh, sorry to hear that.

45:01.047 --> 45:02.128
I said, come back to my hotel.

45:02.148 --> 45:02.849
I'm going to have dinner.

45:03.510 --> 45:06.753
Let Rupert Murdoch pay for our dinner, for heaven's sakes.

45:07.474 --> 45:08.715
I hope everything's okay.

45:08.896 --> 45:10.277
Is everything all right, I hope?

45:10.578 --> 45:21.531
The politics at Harvard, because, you know, he was at Lamont, and they just, you know, they talk to all of those professional, you know, that's one thing that's... I spent a lot of time at Harvard on my book.

45:21.592 --> 45:27.299
My wish was I could get a lot of work over there, and the politics at Harvard are outrageous.

45:27.499 --> 45:30.883
I think they ground him down and ground him down and ground him down, and he hadn't written.

45:31.063 --> 45:31.744
He hasn't written.

45:31.764 --> 45:35.809
He's not... I never thought his poetry was as wonderful as his prose.

45:35.958 --> 45:38.941
Well, that book, When the Tree Sings, was poetry, actually.

45:39.101 --> 45:40.022
It was a little vignette.

45:40.062 --> 45:41.343
It was a mosaic.

45:42.425 --> 45:43.566
It was brilliant.

45:44.407 --> 46:02.505
And we start with the second book, and the pity of what has become the publishing industry is that now it is all too rare that you're going to find it as policy that you buy an author and you expect that the author will learn how to write

46:02.722 --> 46:12.514
through the process of writing, and that when you take an author on, you're not going book to book to book to book, you're going to commit yourself to following this author's career.

46:12.534 --> 46:13.535
It doesn't happen anymore.

46:13.555 --> 46:24.848
I doubt if Simon Schuster would ever pick up a Sprout of Salviaris now, I mean, the first book, because that was strictly a literary book that really had very little hope of a commercial success.

46:24.980 --> 46:27.644
He's not writing, and that's the sadness that I saw in him.

46:27.884 --> 46:29.106
That's really too bad.

46:29.126 --> 46:31.148
I mean, his family is okay, I trust.

46:31.189 --> 46:37.457
Heather was okay, and he had had some kind of operation, something removed.

46:37.978 --> 46:42.304
I mean, you know, you don't want to talk about surgery while you're, you know, tugging into your pasta.

46:42.965 --> 46:48.332
But the point was, it was a very odd thing for me because I had this whole Rishti thing had happened, and I hadn't seen him.

46:48.913 --> 46:54.160
And then when I see him, he starts telling me about how terrible his life had been.

46:54.595 --> 46:56.018
I'm so sorry to hear that.

46:56.840 --> 46:57.802
He's actually reading.

46:57.842 --> 47:08.024
When the inspiration freezes up, it's as though you're speaking to someone who's behind a veil.

47:08.445 --> 47:14.798
If you don't mind talking briefly about what that whole Rushdie thing did to your John Dollar book, I mean, you talk about that.

47:15.453 --> 47:22.325
Harbour Collins printed... Listen, let's put this in perspective, for God's sake.

47:22.586 --> 47:23.968
Here I am on a book tour.

47:24.088 --> 47:27.274
I'm read, I'm not out of print, and I'm not under the threat of death.

47:27.414 --> 47:34.086
So the fact that John Dollar just basically got remaindered almost immediately is...

47:35.332 --> 47:39.098
is not a crisis in any way.

47:39.158 --> 47:40.721
So we're putting it in perspective.

47:40.741 --> 47:41.502
Yeah, absolutely.

47:41.602 --> 47:46.350
I mean, this is not a lament on my part.

47:46.370 --> 47:47.472
And I asked the question.

47:47.492 --> 47:49.215
Yeah, and I didn't lead with it.

47:49.836 --> 47:53.442
But, I mean, what happened, HarperCollins, let me just give you the

47:54.097 --> 47:59.922
the industry nuts and bolts of it, was that they printed 50,000 expecting that it was going to win their lead title.

47:59.942 --> 48:01.844
Oh, there's a lot of publicity on it.

48:01.924 --> 48:04.667
It was the cover of their catalog.

48:04.747 --> 48:06.909
It was a great jacket, great art, I thought.

48:07.009 --> 48:08.811
Huge stuff, and no author.

48:09.491 --> 48:14.796
And I think I ended up selling maybe half of their printing, and the rest was immediately remaindered.

48:15.317 --> 48:18.700
Because I didn't have, I mean, that was the book that was going to make me.

48:18.980 --> 48:20.201
That was the breakthrough.

48:20.221 --> 48:21.943
The breakthrough book.

48:22.244 --> 48:23.265
And no author.

48:23.285 --> 48:29.895
So consequently, when I went to negotiate a new contract for the new book, my figures weren't strong.

48:29.955 --> 48:31.056
My figures were terrible.

48:31.096 --> 48:32.739
My reviews were wonderful.

48:32.779 --> 48:36.223
I mean, Dollar was a critical angel.

48:36.424 --> 48:38.527
I mean, it won me the Whiting.

48:38.567 --> 48:40.109
It won me the Costco.

48:40.129 --> 48:42.833
I mean, just wonderful, wonderful stuff.

48:42.953 --> 48:44.094
But no numbers.

48:44.195 --> 48:46.538
And so when I went in, and I've got to pay my rent, you know.

48:47.619 --> 48:51.745
So when we negotiated the new contract, I got paid half.

48:52.012 --> 48:53.614
what I had been paid for dollar.

48:54.655 --> 48:56.437
So they did base it on the numbers for that?

48:56.517 --> 48:57.078
Oh, they do.

48:59.120 --> 48:59.601
Absolutely.

49:00.562 --> 49:04.687
Publishing has become a bottom-line industry.

49:05.988 --> 49:12.997
When you do this, and I think it's an important book and you have to do it, go to some Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai.

49:13.297 --> 49:14.258
Oh, I've got to.

49:14.298 --> 49:16.441
It's the kind of thing I'm looking for.

49:16.461 --> 49:18.103
It's the Greek Orthodox Monastery.

49:19.044 --> 49:21.006
And they have there the

49:21.745 --> 49:26.573
In Arabic, the Laissez-Passe is through the... One was signed by Muhammad.

49:27.635 --> 49:28.937
This is the stuff.

49:29.037 --> 49:32.263
And they've got... It's a room like this.

49:32.764 --> 49:34.146
It looks like a school gym.

49:34.326 --> 49:37.792
You walk in, you've got... A thousand-year-old manuscripts.

49:37.812 --> 49:41.398
A thousand-year-old manuscripts with no sprinkler system.

49:42.740 --> 49:44.243
And because they have no money.

49:44.948 --> 49:49.636
And it was supported basically through the Russian Orthodox people.

49:49.796 --> 49:51.920
I want to go to the Vatican Library.

49:51.940 --> 49:52.982
I want to go to St.

49:53.062 --> 49:53.442
Petersburg.

49:53.462 --> 50:02.798
This is just for one opening chapter that will be... The other thing that will help get you in there, and I don't know how strong your credentials are, but if you do have a book contract, that will help you get into these places.

50:02.818 --> 50:09.910
The response my book is getting right now is... I had a full-page review in the Washington Post, a full page in the New York Times.

50:10.345 --> 50:13.729
I really did, at least, and it hasn't been a bad review of it.

50:13.750 --> 50:18.195
The pissiest review I got was from Publishers Weekly, if you can believe it.

50:18.215 --> 50:20.358
They're not consistent.

50:20.579 --> 50:22.741
And also, they're all 23 years old.

50:22.761 --> 50:26.126
Yeah, and they're only getting 20 bucks to write the review, probably.

50:27.047 --> 50:30.792
So tell me briefly now, are you an American writer in your view, I guess?

50:30.812 --> 50:31.493
Yeah, yes.

50:32.080 --> 50:34.384
I've never thought of myself as anything other than that.

50:34.404 --> 50:36.548
To get back to the book, which is why we're here.

50:38.973 --> 50:46.247
My problem is that I somehow have been transplanted in the mind of the public who don't read me.

50:46.467 --> 50:50.955
I mean, they sort of think of me as, oh, his wife over there, English.

50:51.757 --> 50:54.983
So I almost have to make a point.

50:55.621 --> 51:02.673
I've never felt that I've been anything other than an American writer because I write with American themes.

51:02.693 --> 51:09.806
I write about the individual against landscape and that broader canvas of world events or whatever.

51:09.866 --> 51:11.268
And that's an American theme.

51:11.308 --> 51:13.131
The English don't write novels like that.

51:13.712 --> 51:17.038
The English write salon books.

51:17.255 --> 51:22.101
And so I'm definitely an American writer through and through.

51:22.342 --> 51:26.026
It's just that I don't set my novel in the United States.

51:26.167 --> 51:37.401
So apart from, and I'm not asking you about your relationship with someone that's personal, but from a professional standpoint, has it had a negative effect on your career?

51:38.082 --> 51:39.063
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

51:39.864 --> 51:47.194
Because the people who became conscious of Marianne Wiggins being a familiar name were...

51:48.085 --> 51:51.670
have slotted me into... They weren't going to read me anyway.

51:52.211 --> 51:53.372
I mean, it doesn't help.

51:53.452 --> 51:59.641
If I were a personality or a celebrity by virtue of my marriage, i.e.

51:59.701 --> 52:02.264
a political wife, that would be one thing.

52:02.324 --> 52:04.467
But I have never been that.

52:04.647 --> 52:12.798
And so there's all this white noise that goes on in most conversations like this one.

52:12.999 --> 52:16.303
I'd much rather be talking about

52:16.621 --> 52:19.264
My books, my work, or writers in general.

52:20.065 --> 52:24.889
And instead, I get all of this... This question inevitably comes up, doesn't it?

52:25.150 --> 52:26.911
It inevitably comes up.

52:27.232 --> 52:29.454
And when quoted... And I have to ask it, too.

52:29.474 --> 52:33.778
No, you have to... And when quoted, I sound graceless.

52:34.539 --> 52:36.321
Can I use that quote?

52:36.902 --> 52:38.063
What you're saying right now?

52:38.183 --> 52:38.643
Oh, sure.

52:38.804 --> 52:43.168
Because we've had this over an hour animated conversation...

52:43.418 --> 53:04.685
You've seen, you know, that, you know, you've seen who I am and what I am, and inevitably what happens with the press is that they will take the one thing I say about someone and leave with that, and... And I'm lucky that when I'm not referred to, when it isn't referred to, I'm lucky.

53:06.227 --> 53:09.712
But most of the time, I mean, I think that now I've got a sense of humor about it.

53:09.732 --> 53:11.434
New York Magazine highlighted...

53:11.954 --> 53:13.537
Good Reads for the Fall.

53:14.559 --> 53:22.936
And they led their push for Iblis Eden by saying, ex fatwa codependent Wiggins.

53:22.956 --> 53:29.329
And I thought, well, you know, that pretty much, I mean, there's no other woman in the world who could meet that.

53:30.091 --> 53:33.237
But it was like they reached for race.

53:33.925 --> 53:39.352
But I have to tell you, you know, I love it years after the fact.

53:40.113 --> 53:41.715
Listen, would you inscribe our book?

53:41.735 --> 53:43.258
We probably have something coming up.

53:43.378 --> 53:45.360
I've got a 1215 with God knows what.

53:45.380 --> 53:46.562
Well, then you're almost there.

53:46.722 --> 53:49.486
So is there anything I should have asked you that I didn't?

53:51.769 --> 53:52.770
I don't know.

53:52.850 --> 53:55.394
I'll give you my card.

53:55.594 --> 53:56.175
Want my card?

53:56.595 --> 53:58.879
Yes.

53:58.899 --> 54:00.000
Because...

54:02.495 --> 54:08.085
Also, I'll tell Jane, if you do come to London... I will.

54:08.105 --> 54:09.768
I'm coming.

54:09.888 --> 54:12.212
Let's go meet in the British Museum.

54:12.293 --> 54:13.595
Yeah, it really would be.

54:13.956 --> 54:14.957
It really would be.

54:15.719 --> 54:20.868
And I want to take you to the... There are two Greek communities in London.

54:21.970 --> 54:25.296
One, of course, is the Greek community, and one, of course, is the Greek community.
