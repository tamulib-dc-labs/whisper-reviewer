WEBVTT

00:02.478 --> 00:04.441
read, but it's pretty.

00:04.722 --> 00:20.065
Jacques Fabien-Gaultier, that's J-A-C-Q-U-E-S, Fabien-F-A-B-I-A-N-Gaultier, G-A-U-T-I-E-R, D-apostrophe-A-G-O-T-Y, right?

00:20.086 --> 00:30.662
And that is, let me just write this term, planning out the illustration processes, kind of as they evolve, you think that it makes the

00:30.794 --> 00:33.802
anatomical illustration necessarily more precise.

00:34.203 --> 00:38.553
And yet, here is somebody who, to my way of thinking, this is actually not precise.

00:38.573 --> 00:40.939
This is much more what I would consider artistic anatomy.

00:41.741 --> 00:46.533
And if you go to Shulang, Shulang actually is kind of negative on this book.

00:46.654 --> 00:48.398
It's considered to be not good anatomy.

00:48.901 --> 00:52.465
And yet, I love to open it up for the students, because they're going, wow, wow.

00:52.485 --> 00:53.926
And I say, no, this is bad anatomy.

00:53.946 --> 00:54.847
And they all just laugh.

00:55.648 --> 00:57.290
But look, she is a beautiful woman.

00:57.310 --> 01:01.594
And he was alert to that, wasn't he?

01:01.654 --> 01:02.295
Well, yeah.

01:02.335 --> 01:04.337
I mean, there's also something a little intriguing.

01:04.497 --> 01:09.442
Even by the way some of the heads and stuff you see is almost as if, well, you know, oh, here I am.

01:09.482 --> 01:11.004
My brain is open for you.

01:11.104 --> 01:15.388
We'd love to talk to him about some of this stuff.

01:15.448 --> 01:17.170
Decidedly pre-40 until...

01:17.521 --> 01:25.312
I think he may have been a very twisted person, actually.

01:25.412 --> 01:29.437
I mean, he's sitting duck for these people, for these analysts.

01:29.758 --> 01:30.279
That's right.

01:30.299 --> 01:31.180
That's right.

01:31.200 --> 01:33.363
And I don't think a lot of people know about this work.

01:33.423 --> 01:36.247
I mean, some people, but I think it's still to be studied.

01:36.267 --> 01:37.508
Did you tell me the title of it?

01:38.029 --> 01:40.573
I think it's a very long title.

01:40.593 --> 01:43.917
Oh, just something that I could, just so I know.

01:44.017 --> 01:44.458
Okay.

01:44.478 --> 01:44.819
Wow.

01:45.259 --> 01:46.000
You're Darwin Letters.

01:46.241 --> 01:47.342
Darwin, original letters.

01:47.525 --> 01:49.407
So what we're going to do is we're going to have a lot of things.

01:49.587 --> 01:50.288
Substantive?

01:51.750 --> 01:56.556
Yeah, I believe, I want to say like maybe 40 or 50 of them.

01:56.576 --> 01:57.957
A fairly large number.

01:58.097 --> 02:10.652
But we actually are going to be, we have and will continue to be included in the correspondence of Darwin, the complete correspondence of this coming out.

02:10.932 --> 02:13.936
This is our regular, this is a regular.

02:14.797 --> 02:15.658
So I know this is,

02:17.005 --> 02:21.109
This is just the regular stacks here, so this is something that anybody can enter.

02:22.551 --> 02:27.336
But the rare books here, of course, is special.

02:28.657 --> 02:38.888
If you can imagine this, we have had some leakage, but it's way under control because there has been a problem with flooding.

02:38.908 --> 02:45.595
So what we've got here, just to give you an idea, most of the things that are in these ranges going this way,

02:45.828 --> 02:51.933
are alphabetically arranged, and these are, again, rare books ranging in all kinds of time period.

02:51.954 --> 02:55.597
For instance, Oliver Wendell Holmes.

02:55.617 --> 02:56.177
That's what we have.

02:56.638 --> 02:57.559
Poems.

02:58.299 --> 02:58.559
Yeah.

02:58.579 --> 02:58.800
Poems.

02:58.900 --> 02:59.260
That's right.

02:59.801 --> 03:03.444
And obviously here, you see Hunter venereal disease, like I told you.

03:04.124 --> 03:14.214
So this is all alphabetically arranged, and can go anywhere back in time, although we wouldn't have incannabula here in this area.

03:14.234 --> 03:15.835
And this is quite extensive, you'll see.

03:16.220 --> 03:21.587
We have older journals, so like we have complete runs of many, many journals.

03:21.607 --> 03:24.150
So these are all under control on us, too.

03:24.170 --> 03:25.992
We get a lot of requests for this information.

03:26.012 --> 03:29.136
Are you digitizing anything, or you're not up to that yet?

03:29.236 --> 03:31.860
Some of our stuff is online, some of it isn't.

03:32.521 --> 03:37.267
Here is, this is still like, this is the beginnings of the alphabetical web of collection.

03:38.769 --> 03:41.552
More folio sorts of things, and again we have...

03:42.359 --> 03:49.726
Well, you know, like, I'm sure you've heard of Agricola, that's a very well-known piece, History of Science and Technology, everything going all the way back.

03:49.786 --> 03:52.389
We even have some facsimiles here that we use.

03:53.911 --> 03:56.773
Which would be the Leonardo da Vinci material.

03:57.614 --> 03:59.516
This is not original.

03:59.536 --> 04:04.661
Now, this piece, I hesitate to pull this out for you, but this piece is an albinus.

04:04.801 --> 04:08.485
I don't know if you've ever seen his famous anatomy, but it's absolutely gorgeous.

04:08.667 --> 04:12.131
Again, this is a box created by Eon, so both are the same way downstairs.

04:12.151 --> 04:13.032
It's a beautiful box.

04:14.554 --> 04:18.258
But again, the format of it is so huge, it's hard to open up.

04:18.278 --> 04:19.560
No, there's no place to do it.

04:19.580 --> 04:20.561
We have no space here.

04:20.581 --> 04:24.405
But anyway, so this is all, I'm standing in whatever folios here.

04:25.146 --> 04:29.972
I did want to show you... You have a halon system in here, I can see.

04:29.992 --> 04:30.973
Well, we had a problem.

04:31.053 --> 04:33.756
Our halon went off recently, so it just had to be recharged.

04:33.776 --> 04:35.518
And it was recharged with used halon.

04:35.988 --> 04:37.229
Because you can't get new hail on them.

04:37.289 --> 04:40.152
I still don't understand how you have used hail on them.

04:40.172 --> 04:42.274
Anyway, these are all herbals.

04:42.534 --> 04:44.977
This whole smear here.

04:44.997 --> 04:45.938
This is all herbals.

04:45.958 --> 04:50.402
And so they're arranged, obviously, by size and also... Are they used?

04:50.802 --> 04:53.785
Again, it's a very specialized collection.

04:53.805 --> 04:59.491
Not so many, although I know that the art people with the Cleveland Institute of Art use it.

04:59.631 --> 05:02.173
Medical students don't seem to see it.

05:02.193 --> 05:03.795
See, again, we have the Blackwell.

05:03.815 --> 05:05.877
This is another version of the Blackwell that I showed you.

05:06.143 --> 05:34.783
very briefly down Elizabeth Blackwell herbal two volumes large I know and some of them I mean it's actually you wouldn't even call those folios size they're larger than folios well you know we have I think this is Gerard's oh Gerard's herbal is a nice book yeah so I'm sure you've heard of that Sandy Berger once that's one of the he's the William Morris collector and he wanted you know for apparently that influence Morris yeah

05:34.966 --> 05:37.669
And every time he saw it, it was always more than he wanted to pay.

05:37.689 --> 05:46.740
The rare collection for most, but we have other pockets of things up here, but no, I don't, if you want to go down the south, I have to lock up.

05:46.760 --> 05:47.761
Okay, gotcha.

05:47.801 --> 05:48.302
1811.

05:48.422 --> 05:51.446
Okay, I'm sorry, just for the sake of the tape, let's start.

05:51.486 --> 05:53.889
You can just identify yourself for my tape.

05:53.929 --> 05:54.229
Okay.

05:55.110 --> 05:56.732
The Western Reserve Reserve Society.

05:57.133 --> 05:58.094
And yourself as well.

05:58.154 --> 06:00.617
And I'm Kermit Pegg, the library director.

06:00.637 --> 06:00.737
Okay.

06:01.139 --> 06:03.682
And you're saying this is the oldest?

06:03.702 --> 06:08.026
This is the oldest existing cultural institution in Cleveland.

06:08.046 --> 06:27.467
It was founded in 1867, primarily as a library, with the mission to collect and preserve whatever relates to the history, biographies, statistics, and antiquities, and genealogy connected with the city of Cleveland, the Western Reserve, the state of Ohio, and the Great West.

06:28.072 --> 06:30.335
And is it affiliated with any university?

06:30.355 --> 06:32.177
It is a private institution.

06:32.278 --> 06:33.399
It's privately funded.

06:33.459 --> 06:40.228
It was when it was founded in 1867 and continues today as a privately funded institution.

06:40.348 --> 06:40.608
Oh, good.

06:40.629 --> 06:41.169
I like that.

06:41.189 --> 06:54.547
So from 1867, the mission was primarily to service, collect, preserve the early documents, the founding, the settlement, the exploration of the Western Reserve, which is northeast of Ohio.

06:54.567 --> 06:54.687
Right.

06:55.375 --> 06:57.518
And who were the founders?

06:57.618 --> 07:05.629
Founders were people like Colonel Charles Whittlesey, Charles Keenan D. Baldwin, Alfred Thayer Goodman, who was an autograph collector.

07:06.570 --> 07:09.554
An autograph collector.

07:12.057 --> 07:19.948
Charles Whittlesey, who was a soldier and geologist, geographer, man-maker.

07:20.418 --> 07:33.234
Actually, what they had is they had a coterie of learned individuals in Cleveland that assembled and met in a log cabin in Public Square, a log cabin which is referred to as the Ark.

07:34.456 --> 07:40.423
And this group of gentlemen was known as the Arkites, Leonard K's, Jared Potter, Kerr.

07:40.624 --> 07:41.385
A-R-C-I-T-E-S.

07:41.505 --> 07:42.206
A-R-K.

07:42.346 --> 07:42.867
A-R-K.

07:42.927 --> 07:44.529
Oh, the Ark, like in Noah.

07:44.549 --> 07:44.709
The Ark.

07:44.969 --> 07:47.693
I think of the Ark in terms of.

07:47.713 --> 07:50.256
And this group was founded.

07:50.540 --> 08:03.993
and organized informally, and they used, as the story goes, they'd sit around in this log cabin on Cleveland's public square and smoke cigars, play with, and talk about where it's subject.

08:04.013 --> 08:20.428
So this is the beginnings, and out of this group emanated the Western Reserve Historical Society, the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, the Cleveland Public Library, all of the major cultural institutions in Cleveland grew out of these seeds.

08:20.881 --> 08:22.863
zone in the ark.

08:22.883 --> 08:28.749
Were there any seed collections, or was it basically money and resources?

08:28.869 --> 08:29.270
No, no.

08:29.390 --> 08:40.262
It was mainly, it wasn't so much money as it was commitment, enthusiasm, drive, mission, individuals that, you know, of an interest in history.

08:40.302 --> 08:42.164
This is, don't forget, this is 1867.

08:42.184 --> 08:43.525
This is right after the Civil War.

08:43.545 --> 08:46.748
350,000 Ohioans fought in the Civil War.

08:46.849 --> 08:50.112
Tremendous turmoil of evil in this nation.

08:50.800 --> 08:57.686
caused more mature individuals after the war to say, gee, what's happened to us?

08:57.766 --> 09:00.869
We've lost sight of our roots.

09:00.889 --> 09:03.651
Let's get back to what makes this country great.

09:03.671 --> 09:07.615
So there was a great looking backwards retrospective view.

09:07.635 --> 09:12.559
And at that time, there were still descendants of the original settlers.

09:12.579 --> 09:14.220
Cleveland was founded in 1796, the city.

09:16.382 --> 09:19.865
So there were still descendants of the original settlers.

09:19.885 --> 09:20.706
I didn't realize it was that early.

09:21.412 --> 09:22.954
I didn't realize it was that early.

09:23.014 --> 09:24.215
That early, yeah.

09:24.895 --> 09:33.985
And the descendants of the original Cleveland surveying party and early settlers, a couple of them were still alive then.

09:34.025 --> 09:45.096
But many of their children and grandchildren and in-laws were alive, so they were able to contact those people and gather maps and documents and letters and documents.

09:45.176 --> 09:45.997
Primary stuff.

09:46.017 --> 09:49.360
Primary material, which we did for about the first 35 years.

09:49.998 --> 09:52.622
And how is the focus?

09:52.642 --> 09:59.292
Maybe you can just give me some idea about the holdings that you have and how the collections have developed.

09:59.312 --> 10:18.621
Well, the holdings, being privately funded, we've never had a substantial amount of money to purchase things, so the institution has grown to the current state largely through the generosity of individuals who have either donated collections or who have

10:18.888 --> 10:28.958
They provided purchased collections for the library, or the community just donated regional archives and books and histories and so forth.

10:28.978 --> 10:33.123
But so, in terms of numbers of things, is that reflected in this little thing?

10:33.143 --> 10:37.207
Yeah, it's in the brochure, but it's about 230,000 volumes we have.

10:37.907 --> 10:46.296
Manuscript collections are about, we estimate, you know, I estimate five miles of manuscripts, over 20,000 when you're

10:46.664 --> 10:50.048
Could you characterize them, what are they basically?

10:50.088 --> 10:57.456
This is the primary American history research library in Northern Ohio.

10:57.656 --> 11:05.264
The collection is American history in general with the focal point on Northeast Ohio, the Western Reserve.

11:05.284 --> 11:07.507
Do you understand what the Western Reserve is?

11:07.527 --> 11:09.529
I understand that.

11:09.549 --> 11:10.630
Barb explained it to me.

11:10.690 --> 11:11.511
It's fascinating.

11:11.571 --> 11:13.313
I'm embarrassed that I didn't know it.

11:13.799 --> 11:18.243
Well, there's no reason why you should anymore, because— Well, I'm a New Englander.

11:18.283 --> 11:18.684
I should.

11:19.545 --> 11:23.308
Well, interestingly enough, it's us who care more.

11:23.569 --> 11:25.350
We look backward.

11:25.370 --> 11:29.434
See, New England looks backward, so they look to England for their history.

11:29.454 --> 11:31.897
We look to New England for our history.

11:31.937 --> 11:37.162
So we know more about Connecticut than Connecticut people do.

11:37.262 --> 11:42.287
You know, it's just the way—hey, we're more interested in history, and in fact, the Western Reserve

11:42.503 --> 11:43.965
It's bigger than Connecticut.

11:43.985 --> 11:45.988
It has more people than Connecticut.

11:46.088 --> 11:48.111
Politically, it's more significant.

11:48.171 --> 11:48.872
And on and on.

11:48.892 --> 12:00.390
I mean, this stepchild in the state of Connecticut has surpassed... As the United States of America certainly has more people than, you know, the mother country, so to speak.

12:00.530 --> 12:04.195
But this was a plot of land that the state sold, you know, to benefit the school fund.

12:04.255 --> 12:05.457
But in any event, that...

12:06.213 --> 12:08.375
That Connecticut sold?

12:08.435 --> 12:08.876
Yes.

12:08.896 --> 12:09.697
To benefit its?

12:10.037 --> 12:10.938
School fund.

12:10.958 --> 12:17.165
The proceeds from the sale of the three million acres went into the public school fund in Connecticut.

12:17.185 --> 12:17.826
And this was when?

12:17.866 --> 12:19.548
About 40 cents an acre, 1795-96.

12:19.788 --> 12:24.613
The land was actually sold to the shareholders.

12:24.633 --> 12:32.322
The shareholders of Connecticut all got together, and 48 of them pooled their money and bought for about $3 million all the way down.

12:33.027 --> 12:36.793
Actually, not even $3 million, more like a million in the house.

12:36.873 --> 12:39.578
Well, they were smart to sell it because they wouldn't have kept it anyway.

12:39.638 --> 12:41.040
They would have lost it.

12:41.301 --> 12:42.002
That's right.

12:42.022 --> 12:43.765
Well, it wasn't theirs to sell them.

12:44.206 --> 12:44.646
That's right.

12:44.666 --> 12:45.428
That's fallen money.

12:47.471 --> 12:48.032
They pulled it off.

12:48.052 --> 12:49.074
They told the federal government.

12:49.094 --> 12:52.720
The government says, well, you've got to cede your claims to that western land.

12:52.740 --> 12:57.668
And Connecticut and a few other states held out, and Connecticut says, well, we'll cede everything but.

12:58.188 --> 13:02.392
this three million acres because we're going to hold on to that.

13:02.412 --> 13:03.093
And so they did.

13:03.113 --> 13:09.459
And the federal government then, in the 1800s, recognized it and said, okay.

13:10.460 --> 13:10.960
$2 million.

13:11.461 --> 13:11.901
Why not?

13:12.482 --> 13:24.533
And so it went out of—then, for all intents and purposes, the Western Reserve then gets merged into the state of Ohio, becomes Trumbull County in Ohio, and the Western Reserve has a political end and it disappears.

13:25.255 --> 13:29.399
So the only way it has any meaning now is through nostalgia and tradition.

13:29.420 --> 13:32.823
But it's wonderful that there's an institution that preserves the name.

13:32.983 --> 13:33.964
And we're the one.

13:34.004 --> 13:37.949
You would never hear about Western Reserve if it wasn't for two things, us and the university.

13:37.969 --> 13:38.569
Yeah, that's great.

13:38.810 --> 13:44.556
Western Reserve University, which is now Keith, Western Reserve University, and the Western Reserve Historical Society.

13:44.576 --> 13:47.319
We actually ended up perpetuating that kind of concept.

13:47.339 --> 13:48.480
That's great.

13:48.500 --> 13:53.946
And so we continue to be focused on those areas in terms of the history we've preserved.

13:54.247 --> 13:55.428
preserve.

13:55.969 --> 14:02.555
But then also in terms of what we do is we are principally the archival repository for Northeast Ohio.

14:03.096 --> 14:09.342
So we collect papers of families and individuals and businesses and organizations, any kind of human activity.

14:09.362 --> 14:17.831
So it really is focused on the region, unlike the AAS, in my neck of the woods, which is in Worcester, by the Massachusetts Historical Society.

14:17.951 --> 14:19.933
The essence of our

14:20.116 --> 14:22.018
Well, Massachusetts is Massachusetts.

14:22.059 --> 14:27.085
But the Mass Historical Society actually has stuff from all over the country.

14:28.667 --> 14:30.450
We have newspapers from every state in the area.

14:31.591 --> 14:38.080
We have a genealogy collection, which is national, one of the five largest genealogical collections in the country.

14:38.100 --> 14:40.723
So how do you justify that in terms of the collection?

14:43.015 --> 14:47.784
I admire this.

14:47.844 --> 14:49.628
Don't misunderstand me.

14:49.648 --> 15:03.113
Well, so do I. The institution has been greatly influenced by the trustees and members, the people who have supported it, and who have donated it to collections.

15:03.133 --> 15:05.057
You pulled out of this library

15:05.240 --> 15:13.811
All of the collections that were once privately held and or were acquired through funds established by wealth equivalents.

15:13.831 --> 15:17.255
This library would be half of what it is today.

15:17.275 --> 15:24.605
Our national reputation resides on things like the William P. Palmer Civil War collection, the Wallace H. Cathcart Shaker collection.

15:24.625 --> 15:25.526
You heard of the Shaker collection?

15:25.546 --> 15:31.594
No, but do you have some literature that you can give me that will summarize this stuff?

15:32.334 --> 15:33.055
This material?

15:33.476 --> 15:33.576
Sure.

15:36.391 --> 15:39.977
I love that little... We are preparing for an auction.

15:40.197 --> 15:41.760
We have a library benefit auction.

15:42.020 --> 15:42.521
Oh, good.

15:42.541 --> 15:44.244
Barbara is my primary host.

15:44.464 --> 15:50.574
Your primary host is the sponsor of this auction, which we're going to... That's a lovely office.

15:50.614 --> 15:53.739
Trevor, do you have a card that I can have, too?

15:54.600 --> 15:57.986
As a matter of fact, I didn't know what really you were going to be interested in, but I got it.

15:58.006 --> 15:59.188
I'm interested in everything.

15:59.208 --> 16:00.610
You got interest in everything, okay.

16:00.893 --> 16:16.097
Well, here's an article with Manuscripts Magazine, an article that I wrote on the Shaker Collection, the Caspard Shaker Collection, which if you want to pursue that, and here Jim Gilreich did one on the collection.

16:16.197 --> 16:18.361
Well, he was an intern here.

16:18.581 --> 16:21.205
Oh, I didn't know that.

16:21.366 --> 16:24.170
Here's a little history of the thing.

16:24.190 --> 16:27.255
Here's a little insight for an overview.

16:28.282 --> 16:30.225
of the Cathcart collection.

16:30.505 --> 16:35.011
Here's one on Palmer, the Civil War collection.

16:35.251 --> 16:36.793
I think those are the main things.

16:36.813 --> 16:42.681
You know what you could be wonderful is you could give me a folder like this, not that one, because it's raining out.

16:46.125 --> 16:54.576
So the collection was influenced greatly by the private collectors of Cleveland.

16:55.180 --> 16:58.023
David Z. Norton, Napoleona collection.

16:58.083 --> 17:00.465
So we have a great, large collection.

17:00.485 --> 17:05.089
The library of Napoleona, manuscripts, Napoleon.

17:05.109 --> 17:09.353
People come in the library and say, when was Napoleon in Cleveland?

17:09.373 --> 17:11.695
They're looking for some logic, some reason.

17:11.715 --> 17:12.536
Well, there isn't any.

17:13.216 --> 17:16.599
Charles King costume collection.

17:16.619 --> 17:23.566
Because this, the Western Reserve's Throat Society was not unlike all the other antiquarian and, you know, learned societies in the late 19th century.

17:23.586 --> 17:25.187
They were all doing it.

17:25.572 --> 17:28.896
you know, primarily men of some wealth.

17:28.916 --> 17:32.320
Well, you're looking at the AAS that's an Indian mummy.

17:32.340 --> 17:32.580
Great.

17:32.600 --> 17:34.322
What the hell are we going to do with this?

17:34.342 --> 17:55.225
Well, excuse me, we had the first mummy west of the Allegheny Mountains here at the Western Reserve Historical State, because our president, Liberty Holden, went to Egypt, was encouraged to go there and finance, you know, a party, a little, it wouldn't be a surveying party, but a little visit out in the desert, and the natives had, some years earlier,

17:55.593 --> 18:10.609
discover a cache of about 80 mummies, so that when the wealthy Americans were going out there, they would make sure that they, you know, had the pleasure of discovering a mummy, and then they would spend a lot of money, and meanwhile, this mummy came back to Cleveland.

18:10.629 --> 18:12.031
We had it here until a few years ago.

18:12.211 --> 18:20.500
We sent them down at Tennessee, to the university where they have a center for, you know, Egypt-Palatine.

18:20.520 --> 18:24.925
These things require, oh, let's see.

18:25.428 --> 18:29.092
The sign out there, they require a little bit more sensitivity.

18:29.393 --> 18:31.595
Yeah, exactly.

18:31.615 --> 18:39.985
But still, I think it was a very appealing thing, and it was one of the, along with the Tinkerbell, the mummy.

18:40.025 --> 18:40.906
What's the Tinkerbell?

18:40.926 --> 18:48.715
The Tinkerbell is the boat that Robert Manry sailed from Velma's master, Velma, England in 1965.

18:49.436 --> 18:52.920
Thirteen and a half foot swoop across the ocean, first person to do that.

18:53.187 --> 18:56.772
So I was a pretty powerful fellow, so... Oh, I was here.

18:56.792 --> 18:58.875
So I was working in Ohio then?

18:58.895 --> 19:00.276
Yes, in Cleveland.

19:00.296 --> 19:01.618
Worked for the Cleveland Press.

19:01.758 --> 19:06.024
He was a pressman, and... But sailed the boat and became a national hero.

19:07.466 --> 19:11.752
So you have... So we have the boat, the Tinkerbell, and the mummy.

19:11.872 --> 19:18.420
These are things that are associated with society, so that... Because when everybody was a school kid, they came here, and they saw the mummy.

19:18.440 --> 19:19.902
The mummy's the one thing they can't do.

19:19.922 --> 19:20.443
They've forgotten.

19:20.761 --> 19:26.609
the dioramas, the Cleveland history, all the rest of it, but they remember the mummies.

19:26.629 --> 19:32.196
Well, that's the reason the Boston Athenaeum took their book out that was bound in human skin.

19:33.979 --> 19:37.604
The content is really abominable, but it was always the binding.

19:38.965 --> 19:47.697
Well, the funny thing about the mummy was that we sent it in 1937, sent it to the Cleveland Clinic, and it was x-rayed, and they identified it as

19:48.250 --> 19:58.464
so-and-so or Egyptian prince that was x-rayed again 15 years ago and identified as, re-identified as somebody else, the earlier one.

19:58.784 --> 20:13.364
The attribution keeps changing on the mummy, so it became a little bit of a... But how does, how do things... This institution, is it like other institutions in the United States?

20:13.384 --> 20:16.468
I'm really interested in book culture in Cleveland.

20:16.837 --> 20:19.280
It's going to be a case study.

20:19.621 --> 20:21.924
A Gentle Madness is not going to cover the compass line.

20:22.304 --> 20:26.470
This new book is not going to cover the box, the compass, the way my first book did.

20:27.251 --> 20:32.277
And I'm hoping, and I think I can do something just in Cleveland.

20:32.558 --> 20:37.044
Collectors, libraries, book culture, awareness, you know, just this.

20:38.686 --> 20:39.407
You see what I'm saying?

20:39.427 --> 20:40.769
So this fits in.

20:40.849 --> 20:42.151
Do you know about Lockhart?

20:42.651 --> 20:42.832
No.

20:43.532 --> 20:46.156
The bookstore in Cleveland?

20:46.176 --> 20:46.236
No.

20:46.503 --> 20:47.324
Lowcock?

20:47.344 --> 20:50.248
I do like that, yeah.

20:50.268 --> 20:50.868
I have no chance to get to it.

20:50.888 --> 20:54.212
Oh, uh, yeah.

20:54.232 --> 20:58.858
We did the, uh, North Carolina Booksellers did a reprint of an article that was published.

20:58.878 --> 21:02.683
You should have that, the story of Lowcock.

21:02.803 --> 21:05.566
Uh, because this is, yeah, I could probably put my hands on it.

21:06.447 --> 21:12.915
Um, I did an introduction to it for the, uh, Nob's, uh, it was their keepsake one year.

21:13.351 --> 21:18.957
But talking about book culture, this was the principal bookstore in Cleveland from 13.

21:19.577 --> 21:23.061
And it was a little known, I mean, it was, it got lost.

21:23.101 --> 21:25.023
The story of Laukoff got lost.

21:25.623 --> 21:36.654
And fortunately, a fellow in Carondale, Illinois, in their library newsletter, or literary newsletter, published this reminiscence of Laukoff's book Cleveland.

21:36.674 --> 21:42.480
And it just came as a refreshing to all of us who had just heard of Laukoff's, but to get the insight into it.

21:42.967 --> 21:51.119
the bookstore, and the book culture, because that was the principal place prior to Peter Kaisalbaugh, Pink Whitman, as a bookstore.

21:51.139 --> 21:52.642
Well, I am familiar with him.

21:52.802 --> 21:53.002
Yeah.

21:53.824 --> 21:54.184
Right.

21:54.204 --> 21:56.407
Well, Alcock was the generation before.

21:56.548 --> 21:58.130
Is there something published?

21:58.150 --> 21:58.451
Yes.

21:58.611 --> 22:00.013
And you can get back to me.

22:00.033 --> 22:03.278
If not today, you can send it to me again.

22:05.541 --> 22:08.626
He got a great record again.

22:08.646 --> 22:09.087
1990.

22:09.107 --> 22:09.227
Great.

22:11.452 --> 22:16.537
But so tell me about... So talking about the book culture, yeah.

22:16.557 --> 22:17.919
What is your book going to be on?

22:20.682 --> 22:21.643
Kent Smith Library.

22:22.244 --> 22:22.884
Stuff where?

22:22.904 --> 22:37.540
Yeah, in the Kent L. Smith, the new university library that's built here because you walk up the steps, you walk up into the main entrance and you see this, you know, kind of a very imposing sandstone or granite structure.

22:37.700 --> 22:40.463
It fits in with the decor of Severance Hall and the other granite.

22:40.882 --> 23:06.973
ancient buildings on campus, and you walk into the area, and you'll pass through the security gates, and you look around, and you'll see glass-enclosed offices and buildings, and you'll see workstations like this with little wall outlets to plug in things, and you go a little further, and you'll see a little display case with some artifacts in it.

23:07.257 --> 23:34.632
and you will have walked into this place and you still won't realize you're no longer because there are no books that's fair yeah there are no books period and then you walk a little bit further and then you'll see then you'll see the compact shelving and everything is on contact shelving so essentially what does that mean well it's this mechanical shelving that all folds together so that when you look at it all you see is the

23:34.932 --> 23:38.417
the metal panel on the movable shelving.

23:39.338 --> 23:39.759
This here?

23:39.979 --> 23:40.460
Yeah.

23:40.680 --> 23:41.722
How far over there?

23:41.742 --> 23:42.603
It's just right down the street.

23:43.765 --> 23:44.526
Are there books in there?

23:44.566 --> 23:45.027
What's in there?

23:45.107 --> 23:47.710
Well, then you go a little bit further, and there are books.

23:47.730 --> 23:57.865
But the stated objective of the university's director of this development in the Library of the Future is to have everything machine-readable.

23:57.885 --> 24:00.008
Have everything on computers, full text.

24:00.028 --> 24:01.450
What's this fellow said?

24:01.570 --> 24:01.811
No.

24:02.452 --> 24:02.712
No.

24:02.860 --> 24:06.606
Bob Cheshire.

24:06.626 --> 24:09.370
Oh, man, this guy's the enemy of books.

24:09.810 --> 24:12.815
I don't think I'd get into this with him.

24:13.055 --> 24:14.778
Yeah, absolutely.

24:15.459 --> 24:19.124
He's the foremost proponent of libraries of the future.

24:19.705 --> 24:21.367
He wrote the book.

24:22.028 --> 24:23.431
No, let me back up.

24:23.491 --> 24:24.893
He did not write the book.

24:24.913 --> 24:26.455
He is implementing the book.

24:26.890 --> 24:28.092
Like nobody else.

24:28.132 --> 24:33.160
Well, I should say, he's implementing the computer at the expense of the book, let me put it down.

24:33.200 --> 24:34.522
So is he deaccessioning?

24:35.223 --> 24:36.284
It's not, it's not, no.

24:36.405 --> 24:38.167
What's the guy's name, James Niff?

24:39.069 --> 24:39.750
Yeah, no.

24:39.850 --> 24:42.414
And what's his position?

24:42.554 --> 24:43.576
I'm not sure what his title is.

24:43.596 --> 24:44.898
He's a vice president.

24:44.918 --> 24:51.668
He's a vice president in charge of, you know, information and... At Case Western Reserve.

24:51.688 --> 24:53.050
Yeah, Case Western Reserve University.

24:58.193 --> 25:01.017
Yeah, he would be a very interesting person.

25:01.057 --> 25:03.821
Well, because it was... Say that his vision is Ray Neff.

25:03.841 --> 25:04.783
I'm sorry, Ray Neff.

25:04.903 --> 25:05.203
Ray.

25:05.584 --> 25:06.425
Raymond or Ray?

25:06.445 --> 25:06.946
R-A-Y.

25:07.086 --> 25:10.531
Raymond Neff, N-E-F-F.

25:10.571 --> 25:11.473
You got a phone number there?

25:11.773 --> 25:12.294
I have 368-1024.

25:12.314 --> 25:13.676
368-1024.

25:14.116 --> 25:19.444
It's West Reserve University.

25:19.524 --> 25:21.107
Does it give his title there?

25:21.207 --> 25:21.427
No.

25:22.068 --> 25:23.130
I just, that's my role.

25:24.351 --> 25:25.814
Okay.

25:25.834 --> 25:26.074
Um...

25:26.645 --> 25:29.348
I'm sure he's in the Universal Director.

25:29.549 --> 25:30.810
You'll see, Bob.

25:30.930 --> 25:32.052
Let Bob tell you about it.

25:32.072 --> 25:34.495
Bob knows who better than I do.

25:34.995 --> 25:40.242
But my background is history and archives.

25:40.262 --> 25:41.543
I'm basically a history major.

25:41.563 --> 25:42.064
From where?

25:42.124 --> 25:42.805
Over here?

25:42.825 --> 25:45.328
And from reserve as a student.

25:45.348 --> 25:51.876
But I, you know, came here, became curator of manuscripts, and I've done a couple of guides to our archival collections.

25:52.565 --> 25:59.692
And, you know, that's my focus, but went to this meeting at which Ray Neff talked about the library of the future.

26:00.373 --> 26:01.173
He spoke about it?

26:01.334 --> 26:02.134
Yes.

26:02.154 --> 26:02.615
Yes.

26:02.635 --> 26:03.556
Is he on the record?

26:03.576 --> 26:21.053
Well, no, he's in charge of the library program that is served, and his goal was to have all information on computer machine-readable so that it would be unnecessary for a case student to have to leave their dorm room.

26:22.130 --> 26:24.052
That was the example that he gave.

26:24.613 --> 26:26.896
Unnecessary to leave the dorm room.

26:26.916 --> 26:39.892
That they could go to their computer terminal and read Shakespeare, order a pizza, call home, do what other essential things they need to do all on the computer terminal.

26:39.912 --> 26:41.614
And so that is the goal.

26:41.754 --> 26:43.476
That's the direction.

26:43.496 --> 26:49.403
So that all the data will be scanned in over all the keyword and subject access,

26:49.737 --> 27:08.224
and you won't have put up with interlibrary loans and possible weights, you know, plowing through endless card catalogs, missing books, buying books, paying exorbitant rates for books, scholarly journals.

27:08.365 --> 27:09.386
He states this.

27:09.606 --> 27:10.888
Oh, yeah, that's what he said.

27:10.908 --> 27:17.398
And they've gone, and that was, let's just say that was five years ago, six years ago, and they've made strides in that direction.

27:18.256 --> 27:31.798
And as the whole world is now with computer, you know, with Lexus and some of the other systems that are out there in the databases where legal journal articles are available on Computer Terminal, I mean, it's the direction.

27:31.838 --> 27:33.781
R-L-I-N, 20 million titles.

27:33.801 --> 27:39.811
I went to a little, you know, a luncheon meeting the other day where they did a word about copyright, your book.

27:40.292 --> 27:41.954
It goes out, how are they going to copyright it?

27:41.975 --> 27:43.717
Well, they developed a software.

27:43.737 --> 27:45.360
Newsoft now has the program.

27:45.728 --> 27:47.210
to protect copyright.

27:47.330 --> 28:13.457
So it goes up on the screen, it's scanned, it goes up on the screen, goes into the reserved reading room, you know, on the shelf, which is now on the computer, the student dials it up, and then they want to make a copy of it, boom, you have to hit a button, the button says, what's your student ID, put in your copy card, put in your Universal MasterCard or, you know, credit card,

28:13.657 --> 28:15.819
And it gets debited.

28:15.980 --> 28:17.401
It gets debited at the end.

28:17.481 --> 28:17.942
That's right.

28:17.982 --> 28:28.734
At the end of the semester, then the computer will total up all the items that were recorded, number of pages copied, where all these do, and then you just... Is this all available?

28:28.994 --> 28:29.535
Newsoft.

28:29.735 --> 28:32.458
Newsoft.

28:36.683 --> 28:39.746
Specialty is... Integrated copyright.

28:39.766 --> 28:42.229
...copyright and intellectual property management.

28:42.682 --> 28:45.305
so that you can put things on reserve.

28:45.706 --> 28:53.055
Students can call them up, but every time they print them, just like every time you get a copy of them, every time they print them up, it's recorded.

28:53.556 --> 29:00.445
At the end of the quarter of the semester, those are totaled up, pre-agreed between the publisher and the university.

29:00.465 --> 29:06.613
The university acts as a little bit of a middleman here, but the university, they want to do this.

29:07.150 --> 29:10.754
They should, because people like me are going to start saying, I'm getting screwed.

29:10.774 --> 29:13.577
But I say, well, screw you.

29:13.637 --> 29:15.259
Why should we do it?

29:15.299 --> 29:16.361
We're a library.

29:16.381 --> 29:19.424
Why do we have to police the use of the material?

29:19.504 --> 29:26.812
Well, because if you're acting as an accessory to making... The university says, but we don't want a lawsuit.

29:26.853 --> 29:28.274
Which you would get, inevitably.

29:28.334 --> 29:30.156
We don't want a lawsuit.

29:30.176 --> 29:36.904
So we will spend whatever outrageous sums of money it takes to fend off

29:37.272 --> 29:41.658
the one in a million chance that somebody's going to sue us.

29:41.678 --> 29:43.201
I don't think it's one in a million.

29:44.843 --> 29:46.365
Or, how could you be an accessory?

29:47.487 --> 29:53.676
Well, and I've got to be, I've got to confess to being something of a hammer.

29:53.696 --> 29:54.257
You know what I mean?

29:54.277 --> 29:56.060
You could make a copy for yourself.

29:56.680 --> 30:01.347
You know, you make a copy, you know, I mean, that was tolerated.

30:02.068 --> 30:06.655
Now what the publishers are objecting to is universities making, you know,

30:06.753 --> 30:13.841
Or professors making 17, 50 copies pass them out to a student, you know, instead of buying the book or buying the thing.

30:14.241 --> 30:15.042
And then what do they do?

30:15.082 --> 30:21.770
They jack up the book prices, you know, so if you're paying 50 or 75 or 100 dollars for a book.

30:21.790 --> 30:22.350
You know, we work.

30:22.410 --> 30:23.472
I don't get yours in a book.

30:23.492 --> 30:24.713
You want to make a living off it.

30:25.394 --> 30:30.199
But in any event, this company says, hey, we can solve the problem.

30:30.299 --> 30:31.140
We can do this problem.

30:31.373 --> 30:33.175
So the universities are looking at it.

30:33.275 --> 30:43.884
Plus, this university now is trying to develop a system to so-called watermark documents so that they can't be copied.

30:43.904 --> 30:45.706
And I think I've heard of that.

30:46.527 --> 30:49.309
Well, they've got a system that they've implemented over here.

30:49.469 --> 30:50.410
Stanford has that.

30:50.430 --> 30:51.391
That's right.

30:51.651 --> 30:55.355
Because he's actually publishing books out there without printing them.

30:55.415 --> 31:00.199
Stanford University Press is actually doing books that are really only available online.

31:01.090 --> 31:12.146
You've heard of the new school in Monterey, at Fort Ord, that the California State University System has put up, and the old Army base there, the Marine base.

31:12.166 --> 31:13.888
Yeah, Fort Ord I've heard of.

31:13.968 --> 31:19.416
Yeah, well, there's a library, there's a lot of new books in it.

31:19.436 --> 31:27.267
It's, you know, it's not liberal arts by any means, it's a sciences or whatever, but they actually opened a new school, a lot of library in the equation.

31:28.529 --> 31:35.196
I mean, a library in the conventional senses is a repository for books, where students can come in and get books.

31:35.216 --> 31:35.616
No books.

31:37.258 --> 31:38.519
What do you think of that?

31:38.539 --> 31:40.021
That's kind of what you're saying.

31:40.041 --> 31:51.112
It's happening everywhere, but you have some who are a bit more aggressive, I guess, and this guy Neff sounds like he might just be, you know, in that basic issue.

31:51.132 --> 31:55.937
He's otherwise is very mild mannered, very presentable.

31:56.035 --> 32:01.701
other than this one quirk in his personality.

32:01.721 --> 32:06.146
And so how do you feel about this, this whole, without even talking about him personally?

32:06.246 --> 32:07.568
No, no, I'm only teasing.

32:07.588 --> 32:22.925
No, I, you know, I don't, I, you know, I think, as you're saying, I have a lot of admiration for the creative genius, the people that can think in these terms, but I think some of the propositions at the far end are just not well-founded.

32:23.305 --> 32:24.827
The basic problem being

32:25.145 --> 32:28.129
I've come from the archives end of it, okay?

32:28.149 --> 32:32.335
Archives, I look for permanence, credibility.

32:32.555 --> 32:40.246
You know, why is the Depression of Independence in the Constitution of the United States, why are they preserved in terrorism?

32:40.266 --> 32:41.027
What's the purpose?

32:41.588 --> 32:43.711
Is it nostalgia?

32:43.731 --> 32:43.912
No.

32:44.212 --> 32:45.273
It's truth.

32:45.293 --> 32:46.475
It's reality.

32:46.495 --> 32:50.120
This, these are the documents.

32:50.140 --> 32:52.063
What you're seeing on that computer screen,

32:52.280 --> 32:54.763
It might be the document, but it might not.

32:54.783 --> 32:58.788
Somebody might have changed a couple of words to make it sound better.

32:58.808 --> 32:59.549
Put it in a comment.

33:00.090 --> 33:00.631
Come on.

33:01.432 --> 33:12.405
You know, what, the permanent self, accuracy, truthfulness, yet to be determined, and very much unacceptable and unavailable on computers.

33:12.425 --> 33:15.189
You can't believe what you see.

33:15.209 --> 33:18.513
There's no way of guaranteeing authenticity.

33:18.533 --> 33:19.975
Number two, preservation.

33:20.140 --> 33:23.004
There's no assurances that any of it will be preserved.

33:23.645 --> 33:31.756
Landsets, weather satellites, 17 years, 100, how many million bits of information, all lost.

33:32.837 --> 33:34.279
Pewter tapes deteriorated.

33:34.580 --> 33:37.444
No longer any machinery available to read it.

33:37.464 --> 33:41.789
There are instance over instance of federal and privately funded projects.

33:41.849 --> 33:47.397
In this very library, we had surveys that were done, studies of census population census,

33:47.832 --> 33:54.960
data from two counties in northeast Ohio that were done on a computer that is no longer available.

33:54.980 --> 33:58.143
So that this data is no longer readable.

33:58.183 --> 34:01.147
There are things in the National Archive that are unretrievable now.

34:01.447 --> 34:02.048
Exactly.

34:02.748 --> 34:04.210
Everybody thought it was so cool.

34:04.250 --> 34:09.636
Everybody is rushing like a bunch of sheep with to the slaughter.

34:09.916 --> 34:11.578
It just, to me,

34:11.913 --> 34:16.720
You know, as an observer trying to pull away from this thing, I say, it is just unbelievable.

34:16.741 --> 34:23.110
I, Nick Fassbanks, cannot read stuff that I wrote on my first computer, which is an eagle, you know, a whole formative thing.

34:23.130 --> 34:24.493
I don't know how the hell I want to do that.

34:24.513 --> 34:26.996
The stuff I saved just on disk, I might as well throw it away.

34:27.517 --> 34:31.564
But if Nick can't read his own stuff, you know, so I say tough.

34:31.584 --> 34:37.633
But when the federal government is losing records of people, birth, social security,

34:37.748 --> 34:40.532
military records.

34:40.632 --> 34:53.032
I mean, we run the risk of some potentially really devastating losses of information that with using use of traditional sources has been available and accessible to us.

34:53.292 --> 34:54.895
Access to information.

34:54.915 --> 35:03.628
Access to information has been a key component, you know, in this country's growth and development, you know, as a free nation.

35:04.169 --> 35:04.870
And I think

35:05.288 --> 35:10.273
computer data, computer-based information, anything but free.

35:10.293 --> 35:12.616
It's still very illegal, as you know.

35:12.636 --> 35:14.738
There's very limited access to it.

35:14.758 --> 35:18.121
I mean, for heaven's sakes, it will always remain that way.

35:18.141 --> 35:21.485
There was something in the New York Times a couple of weeks ago.

35:21.505 --> 35:23.146
I'll have to read the Times regularly.

35:23.166 --> 35:23.266
No.

35:23.286 --> 35:27.911
They're putting up things in the, you know, sort of bored ghetto areas.

35:29.052 --> 35:30.674
It keeps going in there.

35:30.694 --> 35:31.195
That's right.

35:31.215 --> 35:32.596
They teach you how to look the Internet.

35:32.616 --> 35:33.557
I just don't see it.

35:33.942 --> 35:36.906
Is anything more than an exercise?

35:36.926 --> 35:39.869
That's how goofy things are.

35:39.889 --> 35:41.932
You know, it's just being old-fashioned.

35:41.952 --> 35:49.641
But some of the public libraries like San Francisco, and I suspect everyone will do the same, will provide you free access to the internet.

35:49.661 --> 35:50.282
Okay.

35:50.302 --> 35:51.323
Yes, right.

35:51.343 --> 35:54.387
So you get free access to the internet.

35:54.407 --> 35:56.789
The museums are catching on.

35:56.809 --> 36:01.435
The museum director was at a conference that Bob Jackson hosted two weeks ago.

36:01.803 --> 36:06.948
And the director of the Oberlin Art Institute says they're putting all their stuff on the internet.

36:07.028 --> 36:11.773
You know, they're putting a picture and a description of it, you know, an image of the artwork itself.

36:12.173 --> 36:16.477
And it's going to be, why is anybody going to come to the museum anymore?

36:16.497 --> 36:23.024
Well, we think they're going to come because they're going to want to see the original.

36:23.044 --> 36:25.386
So what does a museum become?

36:25.406 --> 36:27.568
An archive.

36:27.588 --> 36:31.692
You know, a repository for originals.

36:32.937 --> 36:35.981
What I say is, oh, that ain't bad.

36:36.001 --> 36:40.307
Because in reality, that's what should be happening.

36:40.327 --> 36:41.489
You know, the archives.

36:41.669 --> 36:42.571
Archives.

36:42.991 --> 36:45.855
Preserving the originals.

36:45.875 --> 36:47.898
I'm just going to write something down.

36:47.918 --> 36:50.522
Is that Jim Brown?

36:50.622 --> 36:51.263
Yeah.

36:51.363 --> 36:51.984
Is that a sign?

36:52.004 --> 36:52.765
That's one of them.

36:54.027 --> 36:54.828
Is your hero?

36:55.349 --> 36:57.392
Oh, he and Ted Williams.

36:57.412 --> 36:57.712
Yeah.

36:57.832 --> 36:58.714
Oh, really?

36:59.134 --> 37:00.496
The only two.

37:01.798 --> 37:01.898
Yeah.

37:02.519 --> 37:07.227
We have very few athletes and people are interested in sports here in the society.

37:07.267 --> 37:09.831
So it's been one of the sad things in my life.

37:10.032 --> 37:12.035
You can't even get a bowling team together here.

37:12.195 --> 37:14.559
A lot along a basketball team.

37:14.639 --> 37:18.506
Is this kind of like, you know, the AAS in Massachusetts?

37:19.307 --> 37:22.292
Is this kind of a similar thing?

37:22.332 --> 37:25.337
Well, I would say that historically we were.

37:25.722 --> 37:39.957
I think about when we built this library, we probably made a little bit more of an effort than they have to go public, to be a public institution by promoting genealogy.

37:40.338 --> 37:43.841
And that's the one thing that I decided to do 25 years ago.

37:43.861 --> 37:46.765
How long have you been here?

37:46.785 --> 37:47.205
30 years.

37:47.465 --> 37:48.607
You take me 30 years.

37:48.627 --> 37:50.288
How long have you been here in this position?

37:51.470 --> 37:55.594
Well, I started off as a research assistant in 65.

37:56.485 --> 38:01.594
and became acting head of the library in 68, library director in 75.

38:02.896 --> 38:07.844
I mean, I've been essentially running it for a long time, but I've had all these different types of it.

38:07.864 --> 38:14.055
But when I came here, I was the fourth employee in the library, and now we have 22.

38:14.075 --> 38:21.728
So, I mean, we have... So, do you have a clear sense of... You obviously have a clear sense of your role in the function.

38:21.748 --> 38:22.189
Oh, no.

38:23.452 --> 38:29.463
Well, I think now my role is a little bit different than what it was.

38:29.543 --> 38:34.952
In the beginning it was to do everything, to collect and learn everything and to run everything.

38:35.353 --> 38:45.931
Now I have a competent staff and now the challenge are two things, development, fundraising, collection development, working with U.S.

38:45.971 --> 38:48.075
Senators for their papers.

38:48.224 --> 38:58.017
congressmen and, you know, some of the luminaries, serving as a liaison, raising money and motivation, keeping the place fun to work at.

38:58.037 --> 39:05.707
And what have been some of the acquisitions that you're most proud of?

39:05.807 --> 39:16.341
Well, most of them are archival collections that individuals who at one time said, you know, like, over my dead body and 20 years later we get the papers

39:16.844 --> 39:23.191
One of the collections that I negotiated for over 20 years was the papers of William Gwynne Mather.

39:24.372 --> 39:32.501
And if you do the book, Business in Cleveland and all, you know that William Gwynne Mather amassed the Great Mather collection.

39:32.621 --> 39:34.483
Our Mather, right?

39:34.503 --> 39:36.845
Yeah, right.

39:37.566 --> 39:38.727
Built a great collection.

39:38.747 --> 39:41.610
Pointed to Massachusetts over my shoulder.

39:42.031 --> 39:43.492
Yeah, over your shoulder.

39:43.633 --> 39:44.674
West to Toledo.

39:44.734 --> 39:45.855
That's right.

39:47.438 --> 40:09.229
That William Goymatter, the one that hired the Thomas J. Holmes, that did all the wonderful bibliographies, those were done here at William Goymatter, one of the great libraries, including William Goymatter.

40:09.249 --> 40:13.215
I didn't know that.

40:13.235 --> 40:16.079
The AES has the library library, most of it.

40:16.099 --> 40:17.361
There's a lot of stuff in the rest of the story of the society.

40:18.033 --> 40:33.487
But the library, you know, one of the greatest private libraries was William Glenbather, and he hired a librarian, Thomas G. Holmes, to maintain his library and to write these bibliographies, which are beautiful.

40:33.527 --> 40:38.732
We have a couple coming up in our auction, our benefit auction.

40:38.752 --> 40:38.992
Oh, really?

40:39.012 --> 40:42.335
So what kinds of things are you selling?

40:42.716 --> 40:45.458
Well, books, Americana, print.

40:46.349 --> 40:54.578
These are all donations to the library for the benefit auction.

40:55.018 --> 41:06.771
Bob Jackson twists the arms of his friends to give us books, and we got a donation of Palladio's books of architecture, 1738 edition.

41:07.532 --> 41:12.998
It's a wonderful book, a very nice book, and some popularity.

41:14.125 --> 41:15.888
Uh, 200, yeah, 200 items.

41:15.908 --> 41:16.869
We take mail bids.

41:17.250 --> 41:22.177
The catalog will be out on Monday, auctions November 21st.

41:22.197 --> 41:25.562
But, uh, where are we going, Mather?

41:25.582 --> 41:26.744
Oh, so the Mather papers.

41:26.824 --> 41:33.394
Anyhow, his, uh, his stepson was real hesitant to turn over the files, not sure what would happen to them.

41:33.414 --> 41:42.107
I first approached them in 69, and it wasn't until about 1990 that we fucking finally, uh, consented to develop enough trust in us

41:42.374 --> 41:50.285
Part of the challenge of this job is being privately funded and having a mission, which we have with.

41:50.325 --> 41:51.747
Nobody's telling us what to do.

41:51.767 --> 41:54.231
Nobody's telling the society what to do.

41:54.251 --> 42:01.501
There's no higher authority other than our Board of Trustees who said and decided, we're going to collect and preserve it and make it available.

42:01.542 --> 42:01.782
Why?

42:01.822 --> 42:04.606
Because we want to, not because we have to.

42:04.626 --> 42:07.470
How does it fit into the society?

42:09.087 --> 42:17.801
bring it up into this other context, the clean wind, and the attitude of book culture, the ethos, and all that stuff.

42:17.821 --> 42:32.766
Well, I think it's, well... Is it reflective of an attitude here that really is, that really is committed to the intellects, to history, to... The support of the cultural institutions, the very existence of two of the six greatest museums in America.

42:32.982 --> 42:41.273
The Art Museum and Natural History Museum, so appointed and voted by, you know, some reporters of the New York Times polls in three or four years ago.

42:41.333 --> 42:44.257
Two of the six top museums in the country.

42:44.278 --> 42:52.068
The largest accumulation of medical, cultural, educational facilities in the world, right here in the university circle.

42:52.148 --> 42:53.170
What, medical, cultural?

42:53.530 --> 42:55.313
Medical, cultural education.

42:55.833 --> 42:58.577
Cleveland Clinic, oh, there's nothing to compare with it.

42:58.597 --> 43:00.660
There's over 50 cultural institutions.

43:00.995 --> 43:07.886
in this 600-acre plot of land with the university, the Art Institute, the Music Institute.

43:07.906 --> 43:08.888
See, we're all here.

43:09.329 --> 43:11.011
It's the largest concentration.

43:11.252 --> 43:11.993
How did that happen?

43:13.716 --> 43:15.339
How much time?

43:15.439 --> 43:17.081
Well, give me a sound bite.

43:17.121 --> 43:18.964
You know, well, how did it happen?

43:18.984 --> 43:21.689
Well, is there a cultural history of Cleveland?

43:21.709 --> 43:21.969
Yes.

43:22.170 --> 43:23.292
That I could look up.

43:24.013 --> 43:27.238
Well, you know, tell me, and I'll look it up when I get home.

43:30.205 --> 43:49.509
You were saying something about this concentration of cultural institutions, this nucleus, and I guess you're about to say how this fits into that whole... Am I doing something?

43:49.529 --> 43:51.792
Am I listening to somebody trying to write?

43:51.991 --> 43:55.375
Listen, talk, and write at the same time.

43:55.595 --> 43:56.035
I do it.

43:57.837 --> 43:58.137
I know.

43:58.157 --> 44:00.680
I can tell you're a personality that can handle it.

44:02.622 --> 44:05.485
So you must have... Yes.

44:07.547 --> 44:11.171
How did it come to be formed or organized here?

44:11.491 --> 44:17.037
I don't think there was as much of a plan or any master plan that anyone had.

44:17.337 --> 44:25.306
until the university moved here in the 1980s, about 1880 or thereabouts.

44:25.787 --> 44:28.029
Case West Reserve was West Reserve University.

44:28.169 --> 44:30.132
It was in Hudson, Ohio.

44:30.152 --> 44:41.925
Decided to make the big move up to Cleveland, and it was headquartered here then in what was the Dones Corners, the Dones Creek area.

44:41.945 --> 44:43.547
And then, when the university

44:43.831 --> 45:09.370
was moved out here, as it grew in the next few years, it became a focal point of Euclid Avenue, so that what happened is Euclid Avenue came down, the residential area, which it grew in the heights, the traffic came down, so the planners developed, the road was literally a circle at the end of Euclid Avenue as you went from downtown Cleveland out to the country, which was the university.

45:10.171 --> 45:11.914
And so there was a streetcar circle.

45:12.265 --> 45:16.049
and then a road circle for the vehicles, automobiles, and then that.

45:16.209 --> 45:22.696
So that was the university and then the circle, and then other institutions as they developed.

45:22.756 --> 45:25.159
And this was developing, I'm sorry, go ahead for a second.

45:25.179 --> 45:35.910
Yeah, I mean, as the university developed and then other institutions either came into being or were looking for a place to move, the naturally gravitated

45:36.262 --> 45:40.506
to this area, where there was available land, first of all.

45:40.526 --> 45:42.868
You know, there's a number of factors that are involved in it.

45:43.208 --> 45:43.909
Of course.

45:43.929 --> 45:45.650
Historical society moves out.

45:47.732 --> 45:59.022
But this is, you're telling me about a time when Chicago was fancying itself as the Athens of the Midwest, you know, and you're pretty close to Chicago in terms of, you know, not that far away.

46:01.184 --> 46:01.664
Right.

46:01.684 --> 46:05.668
Are you suggesting that maybe the real action was here and not Chicago in terms of?

46:05.688 --> 46:05.948
No, no.

46:06.147 --> 46:14.037
That reality didn't become until later when the Art Museum and the Natural History Museum in its current form didn't get constituted until 1920.

46:14.157 --> 46:16.940
So this is a more recent phenomenon.

46:17.681 --> 46:20.905
The clinic gets organized in the 20s, Cleveland Clinic.

46:20.925 --> 46:21.866
Cleveland Clinic.

46:21.886 --> 46:24.450
That's part of this complex.

46:24.470 --> 46:30.357
So you have Cleveland Clinic, the Cleveland Clinic, Case Western Reserve University, University Hospitals.

46:30.437 --> 46:35.243
These are three major institutions that kind of anchor this facility.

46:35.645 --> 47:00.471
this area this isn't historical say well this isn't like the circle says we have at home well in fact we are the largest uh privately funded historical and the funding comes from private sources

47:00.687 --> 47:28.787
endowment get requests memberships no state no federal no local chicago gets a million dollars a year from the chicago historical from the park board to support this operation we get no state county uh local or federal subsidies okay and our annual budget is in the vicinity of six million hours more than that's historical yes i don't know how big mass historical is but it's

47:29.510 --> 47:33.576
It would probably be maybe as big as the library.

47:33.597 --> 47:35.299
We have the History Museum.

47:35.319 --> 47:37.703
We have the Crawford Auto Aviation Museum.

47:37.723 --> 47:38.845
We have sites.

47:38.865 --> 47:41.189
Yeah, we have properties around that.

47:41.209 --> 47:42.471
Your organization?

47:42.511 --> 47:45.856
The West Reserve Service Center.

47:45.876 --> 47:49.802
Yeah, we have Hale Farm and Village, Pioneer Village.

47:49.862 --> 47:51.225
But this is all part of what you do.

47:51.245 --> 47:54.490
Oh, it's all part of this whole operation.

47:54.510 --> 47:54.610
Yeah.

47:54.630 --> 47:55.872
I mean, you're in the library.

47:56.257 --> 47:57.639
Let me put it this way.

47:57.739 --> 47:58.901
Western Reserve Historical Society.

47:58.921 --> 47:59.662
What's this one?

48:00.943 --> 48:02.125
Go ahead, I'm listening.

48:02.145 --> 48:04.027
Western Reserve Historical Society.

48:05.870 --> 48:06.531
Library.

48:07.051 --> 48:07.632
Library.

48:08.453 --> 48:10.035
History Museum.

48:10.055 --> 48:12.438
Crawford Auto Aviation Museum.

48:12.459 --> 48:14.361
Sites and properties.

48:14.381 --> 48:15.062
Hale Farm.

48:15.142 --> 48:16.584
Properties being Hale Farm.

48:16.904 --> 48:18.487
Shandy Hall, Unionville.

48:19.087 --> 48:20.990
Shandy Hall and Unionville.

48:21.170 --> 48:22.312
Lockhurst.

48:22.372 --> 48:25.656
And President James J. Garfield's home in Maryland, Ohio, which we operate.

48:26.817 --> 48:37.371
We owned it and gave the National Park Service now so that they can maintain it as a presidential site, but we still own the patents in the library, the presidential library.

48:38.833 --> 48:40.155
James Garfield, that's something that's new.

48:40.175 --> 48:43.139
And it's here at the West Virginia Works website.

48:43.159 --> 48:43.639
So we're big.

48:43.760 --> 48:45.422
We're multifaceted.

48:45.442 --> 48:56.176
We have plans now to move part of our operation, the Cooperative Transportation Museum, downtown next to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

48:56.196 --> 48:56.757
A popular ride.

48:58.103 --> 49:01.127
bring it to the people.

49:01.147 --> 49:02.149
Interactive.

49:02.189 --> 49:03.270
Interactive.

49:03.391 --> 49:04.192
All those words.

49:05.313 --> 49:05.754
Big kind.

49:06.475 --> 49:08.518
And it's coming to us.

49:08.538 --> 49:12.924
So what we're trying to do, we're trying to modernize by getting a computer.

49:13.485 --> 49:24.120
I mean, we have computers for internal office management, but we're trying to get the cataloging now, you know, our cataloging machinery and do retrospective cataloging.

49:24.140 --> 49:27.705
One thing I feel strongly about that the computer is very helpful for

49:28.242 --> 49:31.968
disseminating bibliographic information by Sir Holdings.

49:31.988 --> 49:38.598
We want to, like the library, the museum down overland says, you know, we'll send it out there because people want to see the original.

49:38.618 --> 49:38.959
I believe that.

49:39.940 --> 49:42.785
There's nothing that will replace the original.

49:42.985 --> 49:46.651
We will continue to collect paper records and paper books.

49:47.192 --> 49:51.338
They continue to be produced at record-setting levels.

49:51.358 --> 49:54.283
1970, I went to American Archivist Convention.

49:54.652 --> 49:56.274
And there were two data processes.

49:56.294 --> 50:00.138
Data processing was terminology back in 1970.

50:00.158 --> 50:03.883
And the data processor said, well, we have some bad news for your archivist.

50:03.903 --> 50:05.484
In ten years, you're going to be obsolete.

50:05.565 --> 50:10.951
There won't be any need for archivists because the office of the future will be paperless.

50:10.971 --> 50:12.132
That was the prediction.

50:12.933 --> 50:20.522
So we've been doing coming from the equivalent of the computer bureaus today, that the office of the future will be paperless.

50:20.642 --> 50:22.764
And the reality is we don't have less paper.

50:22.965 --> 50:24.186
We have more paper.

50:24.436 --> 50:29.464
And then they say, well, the paper doesn't mean as much, but it does mean as much.

50:29.604 --> 50:32.008
I just had a gay and lesbian archive brochure.

50:32.529 --> 50:39.099
The reality is the gay and lesbian community in large measure still communicates with one another on paper.

50:39.119 --> 50:40.121
They do flyers.

50:40.161 --> 50:41.083
They have parades.

50:41.123 --> 50:42.805
They take to the streets.

50:42.825 --> 50:45.389
They produce broadsides.

50:45.449 --> 50:48.214
They keep minutes of meetings.

50:48.414 --> 50:49.115
They write.

50:49.135 --> 50:50.177
They correspond.

50:50.197 --> 50:52.080
They do records.

50:52.178 --> 51:04.332
that the grassroots history, in large measure, is still largely documentable by... Now, you just say gay lesbians as an example of a group.

51:04.432 --> 51:12.542
It's not a group, you say, but that does everything on paper.

51:12.622 --> 51:17.508
Or is it something that this... No, no, it's over and over.

51:17.528 --> 51:18.709
It's abortion.

51:18.976 --> 51:23.620
You know, it's a lot of the advocacy groups, a lot of the neighborhood groups, neighborhood associations.

51:23.640 --> 51:27.223
Do you think because they feel it incumbent upon themselves to document everything?

51:27.243 --> 51:36.151
No, I'm just saying that when they go about doing their normal course of activity, they are still producing documents.

51:36.171 --> 51:38.273
They're still communicating on paper.

51:38.293 --> 51:39.774
That are worth preserving.

51:39.794 --> 51:41.315
That are worth preserving.

51:41.335 --> 51:42.056
And that's what we're doing.

51:42.076 --> 51:48.882
And they are not, you know, ephemeral items that... They are ephemeral items, but they have to be preserved as...

51:49.520 --> 51:51.081
That's part of our history.

51:51.101 --> 51:51.642
That's part of our history.

51:51.662 --> 51:51.942
I do.

51:52.383 --> 51:58.748
See, I mean, you know, I'm not a lesbian and gay, but the lesbian and gay community is part of the history of this community of which I'm a part.

51:58.828 --> 52:01.431
So we have a very broad view.

52:02.251 --> 52:09.998
What's killing us, the Western Jewish Historical Society, the library in particular, is that we have such an expansive, inclusive view of history.

52:10.419 --> 52:14.262
We have special programs, as we call them, lesbian and gay, we do a brochure.

52:14.302 --> 52:16.444
Black history, we do a brochure.

52:16.464 --> 52:18.666
Jewish history, we have a brochure and a staff.

52:19.203 --> 52:33.886
staff specialists in Jewish history and black history and ethnic history, because we're being privately funded, we try to take these themes around which we can build some popular appeal, attract and raise some money to get some staff to do this work.

52:34.827 --> 52:35.749
You don't pay people.

52:35.769 --> 52:43.541
If you say, well, I'm here to collect the manuscripts and archives, well, nobody cares, but, you know, to try and generate support.

52:44.262 --> 52:44.923
And furthermore,

52:45.393 --> 53:02.400
So that the Western Reserve Historical Society, an ancient and honorable institution reputed to be Republican, exclusive, racist, waspish, just like all those typical New England modern societies were all those years, you know?

53:02.420 --> 53:06.086
How do you break that image?

53:06.126 --> 53:07.468
That's right.

53:07.608 --> 53:09.812
And just, yeah, absolutely.

53:09.832 --> 53:12.055
Wait a minute, you know?

53:12.075 --> 53:13.257
So I remember, I would.

53:13.928 --> 53:17.834
one who's tried to start back in 1970, started with the Blancistry Arcade.

53:18.034 --> 53:23.923
I think that, you know, this... And it sounds self-serving.

53:24.023 --> 53:33.117
But I think the interesting thing about the society... Well, in 19... No, but in 19... You know, I'm trying to be objective about it, because I'm, you know, basically an historian in art.

53:33.137 --> 53:35.501
I just happen to be stuck in this job, you know?

53:35.982 --> 53:40.548
And I'd rather be on the outside, you know, writing about it or telling them what to do.

53:41.169 --> 53:42.872
But since I have the responsibility,

53:43.122 --> 53:58.602
But it was, in 1965, being hired as the first non-Mayflower descendant to be a professional employee of the Society, you know, with no ancient honorable roots even past the 1900s.

53:58.963 --> 54:02.688
My grandfather came in 1903, and I'm Italian and Slovenian.

54:02.708 --> 54:04.891
To be hired was quite an achievement.

54:04.911 --> 54:07.134
I came to... I came to Rio.

54:07.194 --> 54:07.454
Pike.

54:08.075 --> 54:10.378
Well, my grandmother, my dad's mom was Puccini.

54:11.557 --> 54:13.119
I thought you were Italian.

54:13.599 --> 54:18.765
Yeah, Puccini, and then my wife's all Italian, so, you know, basically.

54:19.426 --> 54:21.869
So, yeah, it's great to me.

54:22.289 --> 54:31.339
The point was, as I came to learn later, it was quite a breakthrough, but it just came in stride to me.

54:31.359 --> 54:40.990
Because I was graduating from Reserve, 1965, I was going to graduate, 1964 thing, and I've just been married, my wife's pregnant, I'm in graduate school.

54:41.307 --> 54:43.349
I go to the dean, I say, Dean, I've got a problem.

54:43.650 --> 54:45.812
I'm married, no wife's expecting, I need a job.

54:47.113 --> 54:47.874
Can I have any ideas?

54:48.715 --> 54:49.376
Can you imagine that?

54:49.957 --> 54:53.160
Married, wife's expecting, I don't even have a job.

54:53.180 --> 54:57.445
Today the kid's got to be 30 years old and have a hundred grand in the bank before they'll get married.

54:58.266 --> 55:05.554
I've just been through the Civil Rights Movement, went to a parochial education in St.

55:07.576 --> 55:08.557
Philip's High School.

55:08.657 --> 55:09.238
No black.

55:10.012 --> 55:11.814
I met one black when I was in college.

55:12.455 --> 55:14.077
In 1965, I graduated.

55:14.177 --> 55:25.011
In 1970, I proposed, wrote the proposal to create the Black History Archives Project, which was, we were the first historical site in the country to hire a black professional.

55:25.031 --> 55:30.117
There were no blacks in 1970, can you imagine, in the historical society business.

55:30.137 --> 55:34.062
They worked at the black colleges, Morehouse-Spingarn Collection, you know the great

55:34.362 --> 55:43.893
collections, but they weren't in Cleveland in Chicago and in the normal, you know, of community and regional institutions.

55:44.875 --> 56:00.133
And I remember driving back with the executive director of the Historical Society in 1968 when we went after the, we were going after the suggestion of William Luckenberg wrote biographies of Franklin D. Roosevelt.

56:00.772 --> 56:06.139
And he wrote a letter and said, I went to the papers of Robert Bulkley.

56:06.159 --> 56:08.423
And he was a senator from Ohio.

56:08.443 --> 56:11.967
And I got the letter and said, gee, well, we should have Senator Bulkley's papers.

56:11.987 --> 56:13.510
How come we don't need them?

56:13.530 --> 56:19.438
But I went to the phone book and found out where Bulkley lived, called him while he had died, but I talked with his widow.

56:20.039 --> 56:22.282
Gee, we sure like to have Senator's papers.

56:22.302 --> 56:24.184
Do you have any that have survived?

56:24.204 --> 56:25.446
He died many years earlier.

56:25.932 --> 56:27.855
She says, well, I do have them out in the garage.

56:27.875 --> 56:29.196
Why don't you come and get them?

56:29.216 --> 56:35.285
So the director and I drove out there, and I had been two years on the job, so I'm all charged up and excited about it.

56:36.306 --> 56:49.103
And we can go to her house in Brad and all, and phone the drive, and load the papers in the trunk, and after some pleasantries, we're driving back down Liberty Boulevard, and the director turns to me and says, well, Craig, this is quite an occasion.

56:49.123 --> 56:49.864
I said, oh, really?

56:50.384 --> 56:51.565
I said, well, why is that?

56:51.585 --> 56:54.849
He said, well, do you realize what we have in the trunk of my car?

56:54.869 --> 56:59.314
He said, Mr. Parker, you have papers of Robert J. Baugley.

56:59.915 --> 57:04.300
He was a senator.

57:04.780 --> 57:09.545
He says, yeah, but do you realize he was a Democrat?

57:09.666 --> 57:16.273
And these are the first Democrats' papers to come to the Western Reserve Historical Society.

57:17.182 --> 57:19.946
And I said, gee, Mr. Calkin, no, I didn't realize that.

57:19.966 --> 57:22.068
I didn't know anything about the collection at the time.

57:22.088 --> 57:29.378
And I said, gee, well, if you think that's something, wait until we get the women's collections and the labor collections and ethnics in here.

57:29.458 --> 57:31.381
And he just kind of rolled his eyes.

57:31.481 --> 57:32.242
I'll never forget it.

57:33.083 --> 57:40.793
And batten down the hatches because he was from Mainline Philadelphia Society himself, National Archives, Meredith Calkin.

57:41.212 --> 57:42.753
wrote books on genealogy.

57:42.773 --> 57:46.557
He was the first genealogy and local history specialist at the National Archives.

57:46.577 --> 57:51.881
He was in the Genealogy Hall of Fame, a great guy, a great genealogist of the old school.

57:53.343 --> 58:02.050
So he kind of represented a New England and patriotic tradition that one would associate with a historical society.

58:02.490 --> 58:10.037
But when I went out in the community and said, you know, we want your papers, Polish, Slovenian, Lithuanian, what have you.

58:10.591 --> 58:14.095
They said, the Western Reserve.

58:14.115 --> 58:15.316
Are you interested in us?

58:15.617 --> 58:17.038
And I would say, of course we are.

58:17.499 --> 58:19.841
I mean, you contribute to the history of this community.

58:19.921 --> 58:20.702
Oh, really?

58:20.722 --> 58:21.984
Oh, well, we're honored.

58:22.484 --> 58:23.686
What we took on that.

58:23.706 --> 58:24.867
Did you do this on your own?

58:25.428 --> 58:25.688
Yeah.

58:25.708 --> 58:27.130
Well, there was nobody here at the time.

58:27.190 --> 58:28.751
I mean, you know, this was a long time ago.

58:28.851 --> 58:32.275
But you were allowed to establish the direction.

58:32.415 --> 58:36.040
That's why I'm saying they had tremendous latitude.

58:36.140 --> 58:37.141
Now you know why I'm still here.

58:37.441 --> 58:40.024
Because I had tremendous latitude then and still do.

58:40.527 --> 58:47.274
in terms of opportunities to, you know, achieve objectives.

58:47.354 --> 58:49.176
But it's all based on doing the job.

58:49.196 --> 58:51.898
And you answer to a board, I guess.

58:52.038 --> 58:55.422
I answer to an executive director of the overall society.

58:56.162 --> 59:06.973
But the library's been in a relatively ambiable position because we have had some success ever since this building was built.

59:07.612 --> 59:09.314
And we opened in 1984.

59:09.554 --> 59:11.156
We've kind of been on a roll.

59:11.176 --> 59:14.119
We've gotten a lot of large grants and staffing.

59:14.139 --> 59:15.961
We see the activity in the reading room.

59:16.001 --> 59:20.166
We're averaging 78 people a day doing research here.

59:20.626 --> 59:30.177
We have a lot of friends, like Bob Jackson, who could be somewhere else, but he's chairing a committee to raise the money for our library.

59:30.427 --> 59:37.415
The key thing about Cleveland, incredible generosity, support for those cultural institutions, willingness to donate.

59:37.475 --> 59:46.606
We're going to raise $60,000, $70,000 at this auction, all from things that people donated, so that the proceeds would benefit.

59:46.626 --> 59:48.027
This is just money.

59:48.448 --> 59:59.100
These are things that people could have taken and gone down to a bookstore, or could have sent to Swan, or could have sent to Christie's, and just pocketed the money.

59:59.468 --> 01:00:03.232
They are willing to support this institution.

01:00:03.252 --> 01:00:05.634
Well, which I think speaks a lot for this institution.

01:00:05.734 --> 01:00:07.075
And they support all the rest of them.

01:00:07.135 --> 01:00:11.179
But it's the spirit of cleaning.

01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:12.821
What could support it?

01:00:12.901 --> 01:00:16.965
What maintains all those institutions?

01:00:17.725 --> 01:00:21.109
And, you know, 99% of them are privately funded.

01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:25.693
So it's all donations, subscriptions, people that visit.

01:00:25.713 --> 01:00:28.716
And it's a competitive environment.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:38.351
You know, with rock and roll now, the university in several areas kind of competing with downtown Cleveland, the draw people, Kendon.

01:00:38.371 --> 01:00:42.056
But yet it's a very, you know, it's a very cooperative environment.

01:00:42.076 --> 01:00:56.593
It's a very pleasant environment with outstanding libraries, natural history, botanical garden, wonderful library, historical society, Allen, all these special libraries with their special collections.

01:00:57.198 --> 01:01:00.547
We tend to be the repository that supplements.

01:01:00.567 --> 01:01:03.955
You know, if the University Hospital does its own archives, fine.

01:01:03.975 --> 01:01:05.640
If it doesn't, then we'll do it.

01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:10.853
So we're encouraging institutions more and more to take care of their own records, their own history.
