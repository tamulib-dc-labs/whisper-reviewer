00:02.039 --> 00:15.036
Was the library here an important library?

00:17.639 --> 00:31.017
Also the library.

00:31.891 --> 00:42.006
That was one of the governor of the Ephesus.

00:42.146 --> 00:57.088
After that of his dad, the son of the Selkut, he constructed a graveyard for him.

00:58.030 --> 01:10.172
After construction of the temple, later on it converted as a library on the same side.

01:10.192 --> 01:12.456
So it was not built originally as a library.

01:12.556 --> 01:13.337
As a temple.

01:13.397 --> 01:13.998
As a temple.

01:14.659 --> 01:15.922
As a temple.

01:16.062 --> 01:19.228
Then it was added to the temple, didn't it?

01:19.308 --> 01:22.333
Or it was added to the temple.

01:22.567 --> 01:52.422
The sun constructed the temple graveyard of the Celsius at the very center of the city, very good place in downtown area, but to eliminate the gossip

01:52.705 --> 01:56.350
why this graveyard built very good locations.

01:56.370 --> 02:03.241
To eliminate this gossip, also put the library side by side.

02:04.422 --> 02:10.311
Too functional, okay?

02:14.898 --> 02:18.443
Graveyard should be outside the city, somewhere in a distance.

02:18.811 --> 02:21.035
What do we know about the kinds of books?

02:21.075 --> 02:27.044
Was it an important library like Pergamum, where, of course, the scholars came from all over the world to study?

02:27.064 --> 02:29.508
What did you say?

02:29.548 --> 02:37.280
What did you say about Pergamum?

02:37.561 --> 02:38.623
Pergamum?

02:38.643 --> 02:39.123
Pergamum?

02:39.324 --> 02:40.325
Pergamum?

02:41.908 --> 02:42.469
Pergamum?

02:42.489 --> 02:42.669
Pergamum?

02:42.689 --> 02:43.070
Pergamum?

02:43.310 --> 02:44.933
Pergamum?

02:45.233 --> 02:45.734
Pergamum?

02:45.754 --> 02:46.455
Pergamum?

02:46.807 --> 02:50.133
It's a library in Bergama from the Hellenistic period.

02:50.273 --> 02:50.594
Right.

02:50.614 --> 02:56.144
But here in Roman one, there are time differences, era differences.

02:56.164 --> 02:58.989
And kitap sayısı olarak ne olabilir?

02:59.570 --> 03:06.603
The volume of the library here is around... There are no exact figures.

03:06.623 --> 03:07.585
But what would they get?

03:08.847 --> 03:10.570
Tahmini ne olabilir diyor.

03:12.001 --> 03:24.673
If you consider the construction, 10,000 volumes.

03:28.977 --> 03:31.119
But was Ephesus a center of learning?

03:33.421 --> 03:40.708
Yes, it's the center of the taught knowledge.

03:40.992 --> 04:07.523
Library is exactly at the epicenter of the Ephesus, very good location.

04:07.722 --> 04:08.543
What was that was?

04:08.623 --> 04:09.785
Why did they decide that?

04:09.985 --> 04:19.940
Whenever we visit, we can understand the location and it's a very strategic location.

04:23.746 --> 04:24.988
But it was a Roman library.

04:25.448 --> 04:26.049
It was Roman.

04:26.510 --> 04:30.917
So we believe the texts were all Roman texts or you think they were Greek texts?

04:30.937 --> 04:35.003
Yes, Latin or Yunanca.

04:35.203 --> 04:35.483
Both.

04:36.124 --> 04:37.206
Greek and...

04:37.557 --> 04:40.081
How long has he been working here?

04:40.301 --> 05:07.260
Does he have a sense of the significance of Ephesus in history and maybe you can talk a little bit about the site that he has, the historical significance of it?

05:07.612 --> 05:36.623
So, you know, so... So, you know, so... So, you know, so... So, you know, so... So, you know, so... So, you know, so... So, you know, so... So, you know, so... So, you know, so...

05:37.700 --> 06:06.576
In Rome, in Istanbul, in Antioch and other Athens, in Roman cities, the Middle Age cities also constructed, established

06:07.366 --> 06:11.470
on the Hellenistic period.

06:11.490 --> 06:12.992
And nothing left there.

06:13.533 --> 06:18.698
Because the successive cities established the same place.

06:18.818 --> 06:20.820
But Ephesus, nothing.

06:21.761 --> 06:25.565
Middle East lost the importance.

06:27.067 --> 06:32.833
And 18,000 square meters available here.

06:33.320 --> 06:37.204
to be excavated, very large air, square meter.

06:37.545 --> 06:42.050
It's very intense archaeological area.

06:42.550 --> 06:47.796
They remain to be excavated or that are available for excavation?

06:48.237 --> 06:50.799
Available for excavation.

06:50.940 --> 06:56.666
Also, this museum is among the Ephesus area.

06:57.086 --> 07:03.073
We are sitting on the Ephesus.

07:03.475 --> 07:11.087
Only the five persons and one to ten persons estimations only excavated.

07:11.508 --> 07:18.779
About five percent of the Ephesus excavated yet.

07:19.600 --> 07:20.121
Only five?

07:20.261 --> 07:21.844
Only five percent.

07:21.924 --> 07:28.234
What great things does he think remains to be discovered?

07:29.092 --> 07:34.599
Artemis temple is still down there.

07:35.320 --> 07:37.122
One of the wonders.

07:37.723 --> 07:39.165
Statues of the Artemis.

07:41.388 --> 07:42.609
Most important findings.

07:43.510 --> 07:48.276
So why do they think that's here and not where at the site?

07:48.957 --> 07:51.420
Neden alanda değil de burada diyor?

07:51.440 --> 07:53.323
Korumak için değil mi?

07:53.343 --> 07:54.424
Bulunan heykeller.

07:55.535 --> 07:58.258
Artemis temple or statues you meet?

07:58.278 --> 07:59.900
Well, what was he saying, the statues?

07:59.920 --> 08:00.660
Statues, yes.

08:00.701 --> 08:01.521
Statues of Artemis.

08:02.402 --> 08:07.948
Displayed in the museum to protect against sun and rain.

08:09.009 --> 08:10.431
But he thinks they're still buried now.

08:10.451 --> 08:10.711
Yes.

08:10.952 --> 08:11.192
Yes.

08:12.814 --> 08:15.396
Why, I know you answered me in the car, maybe he can answer.

08:16.197 --> 08:21.463
Why did this city not, why were there not successive cities built on top of this one?

08:21.503 --> 08:25.407
Why did it end, terminate as a city?

08:25.589 --> 08:55.056
The port lost the importance I mentioned before.

08:55.340 --> 09:07.252
In 12th century only a single village left at that time.

09:07.913 --> 09:24.250
And then Turkish

09:24.753 --> 09:27.577
came to here in the 14th century.

09:38.051 --> 09:51.368
Beginning from the museum area, till Ephesus about one kilometer is protected, no settlement.

09:52.107 --> 10:01.340
After the loss of its port, the FSS lost the importance and economical power.

10:02.381 --> 10:03.283
So they were trading.

10:03.403 --> 10:04.745
Yeah, the commerce was there.

10:04.765 --> 10:06.006
Trading is the number one.

10:06.207 --> 10:09.812
I'm just trying to write down his name here.

10:10.773 --> 10:11.414
Yeah.

10:11.474 --> 10:13.737
Write down his name.

10:13.897 --> 10:15.439
Does he have a car name?

10:18.744 --> 10:20.547
Yes, correct.

10:21.308 --> 10:21.608
Thank you.

10:22.752 --> 10:25.897
Does he work in excavation?

10:26.938 --> 10:30.083
Yes, in active role.

10:31.185 --> 10:32.447
How do you decide where to go?

10:32.527 --> 10:51.375
Is it mainly by location or how do they decide what to excavate?

10:51.963 --> 10:56.409
for an emergency need.

10:56.490 --> 11:06.264
There are some places you should excavate immediately otherwise to be lost.

11:07.506 --> 11:09.448
The first importance given to those places.

11:09.468 --> 11:21.666
As an archaeologist, he is against the excavation for time being.

11:22.237 --> 11:30.347
The soil covered findings are very well protected.

11:33.250 --> 11:37.616
Excavating is going on for 100 years.

11:38.416 --> 11:51.332
The findings, already excavated ones, should be renovated and restored.

11:51.464 --> 11:56.430
After finishing them, the new excavations should be done.

12:01.536 --> 12:19.497
Most of the ancient science in Turkey needs new excavations because a lot of wrongdoing done.

12:19.983 --> 12:29.631
especially prehistoric sites suffered a lot because of the old technology and wrong excavations.

12:31.333 --> 12:40.521
Ministry of Culture gave the funds.

12:40.541 --> 12:49.028
Fifty percent of those funds should be allocated to restorations, not only excavations.

12:50.003 --> 13:04.418
restorations getting a lot of importance so but only only five percent of the city yes estimation between the one to ten in his opinion one percent

13:04.533 --> 13:08.577
And some scholars say it's 10%, say 5%.

13:08.657 --> 13:12.281
But does he think that they did the most important part first?

13:12.301 --> 13:13.722
Is this the most important part?

13:13.742 --> 13:15.164
Yeah, almost, almost.

13:15.184 --> 13:17.506
So the other parts would be what, residential areas?

13:18.728 --> 13:29.679
You visited the area in 1975?

13:30.039 --> 13:30.760
Yes.

13:30.740 --> 13:57.726
If we compare in 1975,

13:58.111 --> 14:06.303
Some houses, terrace houses we will see added to the site and terrace houses.

14:06.423 --> 14:10.609
And restoration is going on, some of them completed.

14:10.629 --> 14:21.785
And it's a very gradual process, very slowly it's going on.

14:23.167 --> 14:27.713
Not too much added if you compare the 20 years ago.

14:28.688 --> 14:34.917
But it's beautiful and he thinks that the stuff is just fine on the ground for that.

14:34.937 --> 14:40.426
Yes, he thinks and is very fond of this.

14:40.506 --> 14:50.100
I understand that the library records of fragments of parchment that are preserved there, is that right?

14:50.180 --> 14:58.172
Nothing left.

14:58.439 --> 15:18.791
Only from 10th century A.D.

15:20.353 --> 15:24.700
Papyrus findings, the Bible,

15:25.135 --> 15:33.491
Where is the Bible now?

15:33.731 --> 15:46.435
Where was it found?

15:47.073 --> 15:48.996
But it was in the church.

15:49.276 --> 15:57.469
It wasn't buried or anything like that.

16:02.236 --> 16:07.805
The graveyard is the complex we will see somewhere in the place.

16:08.286 --> 16:15.156
It's in the bone, protected by bone chamber.

16:15.760 --> 16:19.887
Chamber made by bone and it's very well preserved.

16:19.907 --> 16:23.372
And I have it here.

16:23.512 --> 16:24.594
Can we see it?

16:25.015 --> 16:28.981
It's impossible.

16:29.422 --> 16:40.620
It's the thickness of the chamber and the roll.

16:41.309 --> 16:42.771
So it's rolled as a papyrus?

16:43.191 --> 16:43.972
Papyrus, yes.

16:44.052 --> 16:45.053
A papyrus Bible?

16:45.193 --> 16:46.054
That's fantastic.

16:46.935 --> 16:52.601
That excites me, yes.

16:52.861 --> 16:57.847
Yes, he heyecanlandırdı.

16:59.429 --> 17:06.576
And it's in Greek?

17:06.596 --> 17:09.139
Well, what language is it in the Bible?

17:09.406 --> 17:25.347
Is there anything... Have the scholars looked at it?

17:25.367 --> 17:31.515
Is there anything important in the Bible that the scholars have been looking at it?

17:32.120 --> 17:49.242
He's going to call somebody else, dealing with that issue.

17:49.262 --> 17:59.415
Because today is closed, all offices are closed, just the museum is open and Mr. Erdemgil also came to here just to meet you.

17:59.816 --> 18:00.777
That's wonderful.

18:05.043 --> 18:22.275
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...

18:30.912 --> 18:35.498
It was a very difficult one of the people who were working with him.

18:35.518 --> 18:59.147
He said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said, he said

18:59.465 --> 19:10.677
It's the transcript from St.

19:10.697 --> 19:11.858
John's Bible.

19:12.259 --> 19:17.724
And it's a papyrus.

19:19.666 --> 19:25.473
Protected in bone chamber.

19:25.493 --> 19:26.814
And it dates from the 10th century.

19:26.834 --> 19:27.835
10th century AD.

19:28.591 --> 19:29.332
Okay.

19:29.733 --> 19:36.744
I don't have any left.

19:36.764 --> 19:37.986
This was very good.

19:38.006 --> 19:42.092
I'd love to go and take a look around.

19:42.272 --> 19:44.336
Anything else you think we should cover with him?

19:44.957 --> 19:47.140
No.

19:47.947 --> 19:52.492
Thank you very much for coming.

19:52.753 --> 20:04.227
The press director gave you a book about Ephesus?

20:04.887 --> 20:07.370
The book that he gave me, yes.

20:07.551 --> 20:09.933
Yes, I have it.

20:10.995 --> 20:13.718
Yes, yes.

20:13.985 --> 20:25.480
architectural value is very important.

20:25.560 --> 20:30.266
We will see in Southland's library, one of the highlights of the city.

20:30.667 --> 20:33.691
And this was restored by, was it Austrians?

20:33.731 --> 20:40.920
Who restored the life?

20:41.474 --> 20:55.249
The Austrian firm Kalinger is the sponsor of the excavations.

20:55.749 --> 21:03.558
I wonder why they picked the library to restore.

21:03.698 --> 21:04.999
Why did they pick the library?

21:05.019 --> 21:07.802
Why not something else?

21:08.474 --> 21:12.532
Restoration, kütübhane yapmasının önemli bir sebebi var mıydı?

21:12.632 --> 21:14.742
O niye seçildi?

21:14.822 --> 21:17.293
Bulutlar mı daha çoktu?

21:17.333 --> 21:17.775
Bulutlara çoktu.

21:18.363 --> 21:23.949
A lot of finding in well-preserved conditions.

21:24.109 --> 21:29.615
Easy to restore it.

21:29.755 --> 21:34.801
Restoration is very expensive.

21:35.161 --> 21:48.235
It was good condition and it takes about eight to ten years to be completed.

21:48.603 --> 21:52.187
I finished it in 1978.

21:56.572 --> 21:59.295
I'm not safe.

21:59.335 --> 22:15.673
Please thank you very much for coming in.

22:15.856 --> 22:35.215
I'm going to get a card.

22:37.338 --> 22:55.785
What's the trademark of the recorder?

22:56.137 --> 22:57.138
Thank you very much.

22:57.579 --> 23:13.742
I have this as a... I carry two.

23:14.864 --> 23:24.878
There's one as a backup because I can't find it.

23:25.769 --> 23:28.013
I have this one.

23:28.294 --> 23:31.801
I have this one for the distance.

23:31.981 --> 23:33.725
This is excellent.

23:34.105 --> 23:36.851
And it goes in both directions.

23:36.931 --> 23:44.285
It gets to the end, and then it automatically records in the other direction, so you get two hours.

23:44.426 --> 23:46.630
On one battery.

23:47.926 --> 23:48.787
Explain a little bit.

23:48.807 --> 23:51.652
When it gets to the end, it automatically records in the other direction.

23:52.012 --> 24:02.648
So it goes two hours.

24:05.392 --> 24:05.833
Very good.

24:07.195 --> 24:07.635
Okay.

24:07.835 --> 24:14.946
So, I'll tell him I'll make sure he gets a copy of the music when it comes out.

24:15.517 --> 24:24.897
We're only in the year 2000.

24:24.957 --> 24:27.001
Almost done.

24:27.081 --> 24:32.873
This is the most important part.

24:33.053 --> 24:35.719
This is where it all begins.

24:36.070 --> 24:52.213
Thank you very much.

24:53.174 --> 25:05.672
Thank you.

25:07.323 --> 25:19.307
Thank you.

25:25.531 --> 25:52.887
Oh, this is amazing.

25:52.907 --> 25:53.348
This is a tarot house.

25:53.368 --> 25:53.748
It's a tarot house.

25:53.768 --> 25:54.289
Oh, this is a tarot house.

25:58.032 --> 26:01.116
Oh.

26:11.329 --> 26:17.397
Oh.

26:17.417 --> 26:17.477
Oh.

26:17.497 --> 26:17.777
Oh.

26:26.768 --> 26:26.829
Oh.

26:26.849 --> 26:26.909
Oh.

26:26.929 --> 26:26.989
Oh.

26:27.009 --> 26:27.069
Oh.

26:27.089 --> 26:27.149
Oh.

26:27.169 --> 26:27.229
Oh.

26:31.546 --> 26:50.597
And we saw yesterday the indigestion.

26:50.617 --> 26:53.942
I'm telling you the truth.

26:54.445 --> 27:19.291
.

27:19.311 --> 27:19.331
.

27:19.351 --> 27:19.371
.

27:19.391 --> 27:19.411
.

27:19.431 --> 27:19.451
.

27:19.471 --> 27:19.491
.

27:24.550 --> 27:46.597
Marble.

27:49.060 --> 27:49.140
Yes?

27:59.414 --> 28:17.694
Yes, live.

28:17.714 --> 28:17.794
Yes.

28:32.962 --> 28:57.177
Let me know what you can say.

28:57.197 --> 28:58.559
We are in the spirit of religion, which is such a sound or a spirit.

28:58.579 --> 29:00.221
It is in this spirit that doesn't matter anything, and in some form, just hold it.

29:00.241 --> 29:01.483
That's the norm of society, which is just a spirit and spirit.

29:01.835 --> 29:16.975
Almost a little bit of your career, but I think it's a project.

29:16.995 --> 29:18.777
At this time, it was a sport.

29:18.797 --> 29:20.039
That is a hobby.

29:20.059 --> 29:23.383
At this time, it's a sport.

29:23.403 --> 29:23.824
I think it's a sport.

29:23.844 --> 29:24.805
I think it's a sport, a sport, a sport, a sport.

29:25.932 --> 29:33.360
This really was what the... how do you call it?

29:33.380 --> 29:35.863
Yes, how do you call it?

29:39.647 --> 29:41.369
Oh, okay.

29:41.389 --> 29:46.255
In the town, I see it here.

29:46.275 --> 29:46.895
Do you know what you mean here?

29:46.915 --> 29:47.156
Yes, it was.

29:47.176 --> 29:49.258
It was here.

29:49.278 --> 29:49.358
Yes.

30:04.120 --> 30:26.052
To the point is why there is from the formula of the pouncy we would do to the effort we would do.

30:26.072 --> 30:26.653
That would be very important.

30:26.673 --> 30:27.915
That is what I would like to say.

30:27.935 --> 30:29.537
Frank pouncy.

30:30.715 --> 30:53.748
Work is very important, like the modern servants, you know, the fashion.

30:53.768 --> 30:54.349
Have you ever made some work?

30:54.369 --> 30:54.449
Yes.

30:54.469 --> 30:54.550
Yes.

30:54.570 --> 30:54.650
Yes.

30:54.670 --> 30:54.750
Yes.

30:54.770 --> 30:54.850
Yes.

30:58.323 --> 31:23.758
There's a question.

31:23.778 --> 31:24.259
How many of you started?

31:24.279 --> 31:24.479
Thank you.

31:24.499 --> 31:24.699
Thank you.

31:24.719 --> 31:24.920
Thank you.

31:24.940 --> 31:25.140
Thank you.

32:21.027 --> 32:23.105
Yeah.

32:23.125 --> 32:25.587
Well... Well...

32:43.538 --> 33:12.111
This is my life, my life, my life, my life, my life, my life, my life, my life, my life, my life, my life, my life, my life, my life, my life, my life, my life, my life, my life, my life, my life, my life, my life,

33:22.537 --> 33:49.382
Sandhya.

33:49.402 --> 33:49.562
Sandhya.

33:49.582 --> 33:49.742
Sandhya.

33:53.317 --> 34:04.018
Wow.

34:27.708 --> 34:48.595
It's one of the people that I do, right now.

34:48.615 --> 34:49.155
It's going up in my window.

34:49.175 --> 34:49.716
It's going up in my window.

34:50.472 --> 34:59.816
It's really a reason to never even describe material to us.

34:59.836 --> 35:00.678
It's like that's how we're going to do it.

35:00.698 --> 35:01.119
We're going to do it.

35:01.139 --> 35:01.560
We're going to do it.

35:01.580 --> 35:02.001
We're going to do it.

35:18.383 --> 35:21.053
Thank you.

35:56.926 --> 36:12.655
It's just like that.

36:12.675 --> 36:13.076
It sounds like that.

36:13.096 --> 36:13.497
It's just like that.

36:13.517 --> 36:13.917
It's just like that.

36:13.937 --> 36:14.338
It's just like that.

36:14.358 --> 36:15.260
It's just like that.

36:15.280 --> 36:15.681
It's just like that.

36:15.701 --> 36:16.101
It's just like that.

36:16.122 --> 36:16.522
It's just like that.

36:16.542 --> 36:16.943
It's just like that.

37:09.877 --> 37:28.145
We have a full circle.

37:28.165 --> 37:28.605
We have a full circle.

37:28.625 --> 37:29.066
We have a full circle.

37:29.086 --> 37:29.527
We have a full circle.

37:29.547 --> 37:29.987
We have a full circle.

37:30.007 --> 37:31.470
We have a full circle.

37:31.490 --> 37:31.930
We have a full circle.

37:31.950 --> 37:32.391
We have a full circle.

37:53.532 --> 38:17.245
... ... ... ... ...

38:32.378 --> 38:45.628
How is it?

39:01.640 --> 39:28.030
Is that it?

39:28.090 --> 39:28.170
Yeah

39:29.770 --> 39:35.774
Diana.

39:35.794 --> 39:36.095
Thank you.

39:36.115 --> 39:36.878
Thank you.

39:46.038 --> 39:50.426
Yes.

39:50.446 --> 39:51.007
Yes.

39:51.027 --> 40:11.081
And then giving a lot of food to the people, feeding them with arrows and balls, and I will send them back to the people.

40:11.101 --> 40:11.742
Oh, yes.

40:13.460 --> 40:34.759
um

40:41.000 --> 41:04.543
... ... ... ... ...

41:20.082 --> 41:45.702
It could be the war.

42:08.125 --> 42:32.360
Go on.

42:32.380 --> 42:32.501
Go on.

42:32.521 --> 42:32.641
Go on.

42:32.661 --> 42:32.781
Go on.

42:32.801 --> 42:34.063
Go on.

42:34.083 --> 42:34.183
Yeah.

42:55.747 --> 43:07.478
I don't know.

43:34.778 --> 43:36.250
you

44:14.300 --> 44:29.642
Thank you.

44:30.010 --> 44:55.155
.

44:55.175 --> 44:55.195
.

44:55.215 --> 44:55.235
.

44:55.255 --> 44:55.275
.

44:55.812 --> 45:22.104
Thank you.

45:22.124 --> 45:22.324
Thank you.

45:22.345 --> 45:22.545
Thank you.

45:22.565 --> 45:22.765
Thank you.

45:22.745 --> 45:47.301
Thank you.

45:47.281 --> 46:00.531
the world

46:01.068 --> 46:27.945
.

46:27.965 --> 46:27.985
.

46:28.005 --> 46:28.025
.

46:28.045 --> 46:28.065
.

46:28.085 --> 46:28.105
.

46:30.903 --> 46:52.679
.

46:52.699 --> 46:52.719
.

46:52.739 --> 46:52.759
.

46:57.886 --> 47:24.130
... ... ... ... ... ...

47:24.110 --> 47:42.152
The tabloid is right out there.

47:46.621 --> 48:05.006
You know what's going on?

48:05.026 --> 48:05.967
When you die from the dead, you can live to us.

48:05.987 --> 48:07.349
You know what's going on?

48:07.369 --> 48:08.651
You know what's going on?

48:08.671 --> 48:09.211
You know what's going on?

48:09.231 --> 48:09.732
You know what's going on?

48:09.752 --> 48:10.333
You know what's going on?

48:10.353 --> 48:10.854
You know what's going on?

48:10.874 --> 48:11.194
What's going on?

48:11.174 --> 48:30.616
and one of the others, one of the others.

48:30.636 --> 48:31.356
So there are still some communities.

48:31.376 --> 48:36.422
First, they came, certainly, in the language of the language of the language of the language of the language of the language of the language of the language of the language of the language of the language of the language of the language of the language

48:36.402 --> 49:01.384
And if you have two of them, I will be seated.

49:01.405 --> 49:01.985
That's what I'm going to say.

49:02.005 --> 49:02.345
And I'll be here.

49:02.365 --> 49:02.706
Beautiful father.

49:02.726 --> 49:02.986
Great father.

49:03.006 --> 49:03.446
What can I do for you?

49:03.466 --> 49:04.888
If I'm in the middle of the year, I can't do the most part of the time.

49:04.908 --> 49:05.648
I can't do the most part of the year.

49:05.668 --> 49:06.409
I can't do the most part of the year.

49:06.389 --> 49:30.793
Thank you.

49:41.590 --> 50:00.214
I want to get rid of the nature.

50:00.234 --> 50:07.243
All that I want to know is that the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature

50:09.265 --> 50:34.210
Okay, whatever you say.

50:40.265 --> 50:44.908
It's horrible now.

51:30.333 --> 51:30.743
Come on.

52:13.853 --> 52:25.815
If I were to take you to California.

52:25.835 --> 52:26.055
Where?

52:26.075 --> 52:26.175
Yeah.

52:26.195 --> 52:29.762
Right now, you think you're California and you think you're here?

52:29.782 --> 52:30.523
Where are we at?

52:30.543 --> 52:37.576
Parts of California, like Northern California.

52:37.596 --> 52:37.696
Sure.

52:37.716 --> 52:38.017
Just like that.

52:38.037 --> 52:38.157
Sorry.

53:05.153 --> 53:10.219
Why do they use...this is all over the world, so there's no reason why you should know the answer to it.

53:10.359 --> 53:11.681
I'm trying to find the answer to it.

53:12.221 --> 53:15.565
But why do they use the lion to guide temples?

53:15.665 --> 53:18.969
Why the lions?

53:20.251 --> 53:21.352
It's very strong, you know.

53:21.772 --> 53:22.814
I wonder if you know that.

53:22.894 --> 53:26.518
I mean, for libraries in particular, they have lions.

53:26.538 --> 53:26.638
Yeah.

53:29.133 --> 53:37.658
power, strength, fulfillment, like a tiger or a lion, it goes way back and I can't have anything to do.

54:09.650 --> 54:13.958
Now what was the Bowen Mary doing here?

54:14.018 --> 54:17.866
Escaping from the Syria.

54:17.886 --> 54:19.790
The non-Christian activation addiction?

54:19.810 --> 54:27.364
Yes.

54:27.384 --> 54:29.228
And a council.

01:02:47.223 --> 01:02:49.251
Oh

01:04:04.088 --> 01:04:06.792
Thank you.

01:05:05.311 --> 01:05:07.812
Thank you

01:11:49.282 --> 01:11:54.678
.

01:11:54.698 --> 01:11:54.718
.

01:19:42.541 --> 01:19:42.768
Bye.

01:20:26.888 --> 01:20:49.449
Okay, I'm good too.

01:20:49.469 --> 01:20:50.972
Sometimes I'm trying to avoid my physical, physical, physical, or physical.

01:20:59.204 --> 01:21:19.700
Did you guys fly before you went through?

01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:19.820
Yeah.

01:21:19.841 --> 01:21:20.221
Very hard to cough.

01:21:20.241 --> 01:21:20.341
Yeah.

01:21:20.361 --> 01:21:20.742
Very hard to cough.

01:21:20.762 --> 01:21:20.862
Yeah.

01:21:20.882 --> 01:21:21.263
Very hard to cough.

01:23:35.483 --> 01:24:03.533
There's a break here.

01:24:17.232 --> 01:24:36.877
Thank you.

01:24:36.897 --> 01:24:37.097
Thank you.

01:24:41.465 --> 01:25:01.701
... ... ...

01:25:01.681 --> 01:25:18.458
Look at that, yes.

01:25:21.762 --> 01:25:39.444
What is that there, Captain?

01:25:39.464 --> 01:25:39.744
Yes, have one.

01:25:39.764 --> 01:25:40.346
Do you want to use the glass?

01:25:40.366 --> 01:25:40.446
Yes.

01:25:40.426 --> 01:26:04.211
Yes, you are with you.

01:26:04.231 --> 01:26:04.732
I think you are with you.

01:26:04.752 --> 01:26:05.252
I think you are with you.

01:26:05.272 --> 01:26:05.773
I think you are with you.

01:26:05.793 --> 01:26:06.113
You are with me.

01:26:07.915 --> 01:26:27.021
Thank you.

01:26:27.001 --> 01:26:53.008
I will go.

01:26:53.028 --> 01:26:53.228
I will go.

01:26:55.081 --> 01:27:03.285
Thank you.

01:27:15.044 --> 01:27:28.480
Thank you.

01:27:30.738 --> 01:27:52.984
Oh, good.

01:27:53.004 --> 01:27:53.725
The oil and the mining is excellent.

01:27:54.481 --> 01:28:17.805
Thirteen dollars.

01:28:23.489 --> 01:28:48.396
Welcome back.

01:28:48.416 --> 01:28:48.677
Welcome back.

01:28:48.697 --> 01:28:48.957
Welcome back.

01:28:55.518 --> 01:29:21.513

01:29:21.533 --> 01:29:21.553
.

01:29:21.573 --> 01:29:21.593
.

01:29:24.982 --> 01:29:50.247
I love that.

01:29:54.023 --> 01:30:11.757
There are just activities in the city.

01:30:11.777 --> 01:30:12.097
Just activities.

01:30:12.117 --> 01:30:13.500
The only import of the country, very limited species, are all native.

01:30:16.282 --> 01:30:24.334
What is your oil, right?

01:30:28.904 --> 01:30:46.132
Where did the fish come from?

01:30:46.152 --> 01:30:46.593
But not the black sea.

01:30:46.613 --> 01:30:47.194
Black sea, when you are rich.

01:30:47.214 --> 01:30:47.875
You know, it's raining food here.

01:30:47.855 --> 01:31:05.492
If you want, I can order a lemon.

01:31:05.472 --> 01:31:22.114
Thank you.

01:31:22.094 --> 01:31:48.490
I don't know.

01:31:48.470 --> 01:32:05.128
so

01:32:07.387 --> 01:32:34.491
... ... ... ... ...

Thank you.

01:33:00.475 --> 01:33:21.387
