WEBVTT

00:02.326 --> 00:04.109
We're talking to Hugo Alvarez.

00:05.150 --> 00:07.453
Now, this is papermaking.

00:07.473 --> 00:14.243
And the primary, which I say, or the focal point of this collection are the dart hunters.

00:15.084 --> 00:25.139
I have two daughters, and so to keep them from fighting, I've collected at least two of every one of dart hunters' books.

00:25.960 --> 00:30.747
And sometimes there are three, four, five, and six, because I had to buy collections.

00:31.520 --> 00:33.202
to get these.

00:33.222 --> 00:37.486
So if you look in the back, you'll see many times two, three, four, five.

00:37.946 --> 00:39.628
I didn't realize he was so prolific.

00:39.828 --> 00:40.849
I mean, he wrote all these books.

00:40.909 --> 00:43.511
I see papermaking through 18th centuries, Dart Hunter.

00:44.272 --> 00:47.755
Hey, papermaking, the history and technique of an ancient craft, Dart Hunter.

00:47.775 --> 00:49.557
And that's a boy's book.

00:49.617 --> 00:58.185
But the key are the ones in the back, which he very suddenly did more than 200 copies, except the one

00:58.520 --> 01:02.746
on papermaking in India, where he did 300 and some odd copies.

01:02.806 --> 01:04.829
But most of them are limited to 200.

01:04.930 --> 01:06.172
Now, why so few?

01:06.672 --> 01:11.299
Because he had samples of the paper in there.

01:11.359 --> 01:13.462
And he couldn't bring enough samples back.

01:15.646 --> 01:18.089
So this guy is going to be pretty darn interesting for me.

01:18.109 --> 01:20.072
And there's one called My Life with Paper.

01:20.092 --> 01:22.196
These were all published by Knopf.

01:22.556 --> 01:24.639
Well, these are the commercial ones that he did.

01:24.679 --> 01:26.662
Look at this exquisite book.

01:26.682 --> 01:27.784
I mean, here's one.

01:28.439 --> 01:56.742
Like, this was Otto Ege, who taught at the Cleveland Art School, or School of Art, and he taught lettering, and he taught the students about incanabula and the illustrations, and he would take and buy incomplete incanabula volumes, and then take them apart, and then put them together in series, we'll say,

01:57.211 --> 02:02.877
1200, 1250, 13, 1350, 14, so that they have an understanding.

02:03.498 --> 02:04.159
Now I should take a look.

02:04.179 --> 02:04.639
Look at this.

02:04.759 --> 02:06.581
This is just exciting.

02:06.601 --> 02:08.323
You see now, he made all this on paper.

02:09.124 --> 02:09.965
This one here.

02:10.125 --> 02:13.329
It says Dard Hunter Mountain House Press.

02:13.369 --> 02:14.450
How do you pronounce it?

02:14.470 --> 02:15.011
Hillicothe, Ohio.

02:15.211 --> 02:19.536
C-H-I-L-L-I-C-O-T-H-E, Ohio, United States of America.

02:19.556 --> 02:22.178
And that's out of Columbus, about an hour.

02:22.919 --> 02:25.422
This is only 182 copies.

02:25.903 --> 02:26.323
Wow.

02:27.198 --> 02:29.900
Would have been impossible because, again... Can I read that?

02:30.141 --> 02:31.402
I'll just read it into my table.

02:31.422 --> 02:34.124
Do you want to just hold it open to where you just were?

02:37.247 --> 02:53.321
What he said is, Owing, this is the final paragraph on the colophon page, Owing to the small amount of paper available for the printing of this book and the limited number of specimens, only 182 copies could be printed any more than this number would have been impossible.

02:53.701 --> 02:55.703
This book is number 19, Dired Hunter.

02:56.206 --> 03:08.430
And so therefore, if you could have done 200 or 180, okay, the paper used in printing this edition was made in 1932 in my mill at Lime Rock, Connecticut, the only handmade paper mill in America.

03:09.031 --> 03:17.067
The title page device was printed from a woodcut found in Tonkin, T-O-N-K-I-N as in Gulf, in Indochina, which we now know as Vietnam.

03:17.401 --> 03:24.768
The typographical ornaments used as chapter headings as well as the borders were cut and cast, especially for this book by Dard Hunter Jr.

03:25.208 --> 03:28.391
The wood block used in printing the cover paper was produced in China.

03:28.892 --> 03:38.541
This edition, as well as all of the preceding books from my own press, has been bound by Peter Frank, F-R-A-N-C-K, Sherman, Connecticut, S-H-E-R-M-A-N.

03:39.101 --> 03:41.924
And then it goes into the final paragraph that I just read.

03:42.304 --> 03:46.108
And the title of this book is... I'm going to see it right here.

03:47.101 --> 03:57.056
Papermaking in Indo-China, Dard Hunter, MCMXLVII, 1932, is that right?

03:57.076 --> 04:00.541
1530, that sounds good.

04:00.561 --> 04:04.708
So tell me a little bit about this man, this Hunter.

04:04.728 --> 04:07.091
Of course, I want to read about him now that I know these books.

04:07.111 --> 04:09.875
In fact, I might just take a few notes.

04:09.895 --> 04:14.222
Well, Dard Hunter...

04:18.252 --> 04:20.454
What shall I say?

04:25.959 --> 04:33.545
It was very unique, and so was his son, in that he did leather class.

04:33.565 --> 04:36.068
He illustrated things.

04:36.488 --> 04:38.610
He worked up at Chautauqua.

04:39.831 --> 04:46.757
But, I mean, to really get it, you've got to go through the whole thing and pick it up.

04:47.395 --> 05:04.377
what made him unique is that he traveled to these countries back in the 20s, got the samples and went to these hand-milled paper mills or factories or villages where they still were making these.

05:05.638 --> 05:16.272
And he brought these samples back and then he ran the photographs and he wrote about this, had the samples in there, and then published these very limited editions.

05:16.812 --> 05:17.233
And he

05:17.905 --> 05:21.249
He was the top paper maker in this country.

05:21.890 --> 05:28.357
I mean, if anything had—and a mead paper mill has—a mead paper has a big mill in Chillicothe.

05:29.678 --> 05:36.306
And, I mean, this guy was just—nobody else was doing it at the time.

05:37.147 --> 05:44.335
And then his son took over, Dard Hunter Jr., and now it's the, if you will, the third.

05:44.652 --> 05:46.875
His son is starting back up.

05:46.915 --> 05:48.878
He's refurbishing the house and everything else.

05:48.898 --> 05:49.118
Oh, really?

05:49.138 --> 05:50.100
And is he making paper?

05:50.420 --> 06:03.659
He started to make some paper, but he's also, because his father was married the second time, and his father died, and... Maybe this is somebody I ever try and talk to, you think?

06:03.819 --> 06:04.440
Sure.

06:04.460 --> 06:06.383
I'll give you a phone number if you want to talk to.

06:06.403 --> 06:06.503
Yeah.

06:07.645 --> 06:09.728
And, um... Jared Hunter III.

06:10.028 --> 06:10.909
Yes.

06:10.929 --> 06:12.151
And he's doing chilla coffee?

06:12.291 --> 06:12.572
Oh, yeah.

06:12.732 --> 06:13.613
In Mountain House.

06:14.183 --> 06:17.896
You're in downtown Chillicasse, the main drag, and you look straight up.

06:17.956 --> 06:19.060
How far is that from here?

06:22.673 --> 06:24.921
Well, let's see, two and a half, three and a half hours.

06:25.021 --> 06:25.543
Okay.

06:26.519 --> 06:31.285
You'd fly into Columbus, and then you'd pick a car up, and it's about an hour south.

06:31.305 --> 06:32.607
That would be worth it, huh?

06:32.627 --> 06:33.088
Yeah.

06:33.108 --> 06:37.053
Well, I'm interested in the culture of the book as an artifact.

06:37.634 --> 06:38.815
How about type?

06:38.835 --> 06:40.077
What does he use for type?

06:40.217 --> 06:43.321
He designed his own, cast his own, printed it.

06:43.661 --> 06:44.983
And how about this Dard III?

06:45.063 --> 06:46.345
Is he going to try and do the same stuff?

06:46.365 --> 06:47.547
He's got all the equipment there.

06:47.567 --> 06:49.669
Now, what kinds of things did he print, though?

06:49.689 --> 06:51.271
Was he a fine press printer?

06:51.352 --> 06:55.497
Well, I mean, as far as I'm concerned, they...

06:56.152 --> 06:59.195
What he was doing was he was documenting this craft.

06:59.215 --> 07:02.898
Yes, but he also designed this type and he laid it out.

07:02.958 --> 07:06.201
I think it's a nicely laid out page.

07:06.221 --> 07:07.382
It's as good as any.

07:07.642 --> 07:08.343
How many copies?

07:08.363 --> 07:08.984
Do you have that book?

07:10.105 --> 07:14.008
I think three of these.

07:14.228 --> 07:15.790
This is nicely laid out.

07:16.170 --> 07:23.897
As a bookbinder, I think this is much better than some of the other books that people say are fine printers.

07:24.316 --> 07:26.780
He left enough room in the middle.

07:27.281 --> 07:29.325
In the gutters, we call them.

07:29.345 --> 07:30.026
Yeah, in the gutter.

07:30.927 --> 07:40.785
People look at it, when they space a book, they say, this is, and then they take the gutter, and they always look at it this way, and then they look at it over here.

07:40.825 --> 07:43.329
At least he left enough room in the gutter.

07:43.810 --> 07:48.518
I would have preferred a little bit more, because all the pages always bend.

07:48.920 --> 07:52.305
Is this Indo-Chinese paper that he made this stuff with?

07:52.325 --> 07:54.548
Is that why it was 182 copies of the book?

07:55.269 --> 08:02.740
No, he made... He made the paper that... But what is the stuff that he said that was only enough to do 182 copies of?

08:02.780 --> 08:06.906
Well, first of all, let's see if I can find any of these samples.

08:07.527 --> 08:10.972
He usually had... There you go.

08:11.293 --> 08:17.762
Well, this is pictures, but many times... Let's see if I can...

08:20.155 --> 08:21.197
There's a lot of art in here.

08:22.398 --> 08:27.326
It's beautiful.

08:27.386 --> 08:28.548
So this is his own paper.

08:28.808 --> 08:32.214
How about Henry Morris?

08:32.394 --> 08:34.277
Did he make his own paper?

08:36.460 --> 08:38.824
Let me ask you this.

08:38.884 --> 08:40.847
It's Henry Morris.

08:41.654 --> 08:45.479
So tell me, Dard Hunter then is an innovator in your view.

08:47.302 --> 08:50.626
So he represents for you the pinnacle of the art.

08:51.267 --> 08:57.256
So to collect him is to collect supreme examples of what you're interested in.

08:57.636 --> 08:59.138
Am I on track by saying that?

08:59.559 --> 09:05.367
Oh yeah, this is how I started my collection with Dard Hunter because I went down there as a young man from college.

09:05.836 --> 09:07.658
Tell me a bit.

09:07.758 --> 09:09.580
Did we talk about that, how you went down there?

09:09.681 --> 09:10.582
Look at these.

09:10.602 --> 09:12.944
These are the ones that Dard Hunter Jr.

09:12.984 --> 09:13.165
did.

09:13.625 --> 09:16.368
These are on his father and all the examples.

09:17.550 --> 09:18.671
Volume 1 and Volume 2.

09:18.691 --> 09:19.772
What's the title of it?

09:19.792 --> 09:21.514
We went by a little too quickly.

09:21.975 --> 09:23.997
The Life Work of Dard Hunter, Volume 1.

09:24.098 --> 09:24.818
And Volume 2.

09:24.898 --> 09:31.226
Now, he did 100 copies in leather back and leather corner like this.

09:31.246 --> 09:32.147
Oh, look at that.

09:32.633 --> 09:34.656
And they did all of this there?

09:35.337 --> 09:41.686
No, the binding was done by someone else, and then he did 50 copies with a couple of extra illustrations in full leather.

09:41.766 --> 09:49.697
So since I want to get one set for each one of my daughters, I have one like this for each one, and I have one like this for each one.

09:49.718 --> 09:51.780
So tell me, this is interesting.

09:51.841 --> 09:57.348
The daughters obviously share this fascination for... Kind of.

09:57.369 --> 09:57.789
You know what I mean?

09:57.809 --> 09:58.971
This is a gift for the daughters.

09:59.011 --> 09:59.872
Yeah.

10:00.233 --> 10:01.915
So is that something that they've...

10:02.705 --> 10:06.932
pushed you to... No, no, no, no, no, no.

10:06.952 --> 10:07.653
How old are you?

10:07.693 --> 10:09.617
How old are your daughters?

10:09.637 --> 10:12.802
I think it's 26 and 30.

10:12.862 --> 10:13.864
Do they know you're doing this?

10:14.325 --> 10:14.625
Oh, yeah.

10:14.645 --> 10:18.492
They know that, you know, Dad's up to his usual tricks, you know.

10:18.732 --> 10:23.500
You know, these are strictly... Dart.

10:23.520 --> 10:24.662
Dart.

10:26.785 --> 10:28.587
That's quite a nice setup there.

10:28.607 --> 10:29.589
You must have designed this.

10:29.849 --> 10:33.434
We're looking at these shelves.

10:33.594 --> 10:39.262
Imagine how sturdy they have to be to hold that weight, especially all like this.

10:39.282 --> 10:43.748
You can stand on this corner about the heaviest metal shelving on the side.

10:43.788 --> 10:45.210
I've never seen anything quite like it.

10:45.711 --> 10:47.714
These are papermaking in America.

10:48.014 --> 10:50.177
One of them is still in signature form.

10:51.085 --> 10:55.052
That's a book that's the title of Paper Making in America.

10:55.092 --> 10:57.336
That's the last one he did senior.

10:59.259 --> 11:00.762
I'm still not up to speed on him.

11:00.842 --> 11:04.929
Now, was this an intellectual, a scholarly enterprise for him?

11:05.630 --> 11:07.613
Did he print things, job work?

11:07.653 --> 11:08.896
Did he print things for people?

11:08.936 --> 11:09.116
No.

11:09.176 --> 11:09.757
So what did he do?

11:10.759 --> 11:11.520
He did this.

11:11.560 --> 11:12.782
He had some outside money.

11:13.063 --> 11:14.485
The family had some money.

11:14.926 --> 11:15.867
So he was a scholar.

11:16.228 --> 11:16.789
He was a scholar.

11:18.541 --> 11:23.990
Obviously, he had Alfred Knopf as a publisher, so Alfred Knopf must have been very fascinated.

11:24.832 --> 11:42.743
Everyone was fascinated because he was so unique in that he visited the area, then he got samples, took photographs, then he wrote the story, then he made the paper, then he designed the type, he made the type, and he printed it.

11:44.039 --> 11:46.702
And what he printed was his own... His own work.

11:46.722 --> 11:50.567
His own findings of the results of his own research.

11:50.607 --> 11:50.908
Right.

11:50.968 --> 11:53.631
And now all of this stuff has basically disappeared.

11:53.651 --> 11:56.275
This is becoming very fascinating to me, you see.

11:56.295 --> 12:00.961
If I'm writing about book culture, he was a student of book culture who carried it to an extreme.

12:00.981 --> 12:09.692
Yeah, and he did it after World War I, and it was all done before World War II because all of this stuff basically has disappeared because of the war.

12:10.820 --> 12:13.524
You mean disappeared in the country of origin?

12:13.684 --> 12:14.445
Yes.

12:14.465 --> 12:19.953
So do you think in an ironic kind of way it's preserved through the efforts of an American?

12:19.973 --> 12:20.213
Yes.

12:21.455 --> 12:21.936
Unusual.

12:23.638 --> 12:24.379
Very unusual.

12:24.639 --> 12:32.871
So could you identify some of the countries that he did by some of the... Well, here's one, Papermaking in Siam.

12:33.111 --> 12:35.875
In Siam, which is... Chinese ceremonial paper.

12:36.316 --> 12:36.456
Mm-hmm.

12:37.010 --> 12:40.155
You have papermaking by hand in India.

12:40.415 --> 12:43.800
I see a papermaking pilgrimage to Japan, Korea, and China.

12:44.381 --> 12:46.885
Then I see a papermaking pilgrimage that's the same.

12:47.305 --> 12:47.906
That's the same.

12:47.926 --> 12:48.687
So those are numbers.

12:48.707 --> 12:49.689
Yeah, these are in India.

12:49.709 --> 12:50.830
Those are four volumes of the same.

12:51.351 --> 12:52.152
Right.

12:52.172 --> 12:54.776
So there's two for the girls and two more for you.

12:59.283 --> 12:59.824
Now, let's see.

12:59.844 --> 13:06.814
I was going to show you that gal that's up there in...

13:09.173 --> 13:14.158
So, how did this, again, what was the genesis of this collection for you, the spark?

13:18.002 --> 13:22.567
When I visited him, and my dad died while I was still in college.

13:22.667 --> 13:24.329
Now, you visited Dart Hunter.

13:24.349 --> 13:25.010
Dart Hunter.

13:25.030 --> 13:25.530
Did you meet him?

13:25.850 --> 13:26.291
Yes.

13:26.311 --> 13:26.751
Senior?

13:26.992 --> 13:28.593
Oh, yes.

13:30.135 --> 13:33.038
In fact, let me show you what happened.

13:33.406 --> 13:34.668
Peter ties it off.

13:35.088 --> 13:35.689
I collected these.

13:35.709 --> 13:36.650
This is so beautiful.

13:36.850 --> 13:39.474
I collected these all, you know, many of them.

13:39.654 --> 13:42.217
And so one time Peter said, let's go have them sign them.

13:43.139 --> 13:45.321
So, of course, they're signed in the back.

13:46.143 --> 13:47.464
These weren't signed prior to that?

13:47.484 --> 13:48.085
These were signed.

13:48.105 --> 13:49.727
They're all signed, like this.

13:50.468 --> 13:52.230
So I drove down with Peter.

13:52.250 --> 13:53.532
But they were already signed then.

13:53.552 --> 13:54.593
Already signed in the back.

13:54.714 --> 13:55.935
So you wanted them signed again.

13:56.416 --> 13:57.437
So I wanted them signed again.

13:57.457 --> 14:00.261
So I see them looking around over your shoulder at the title page.

14:00.601 --> 14:00.882
Right.

14:01.683 --> 14:02.704
So we drove down.

14:03.140 --> 14:09.409
We arrived in the afternoon, and he knew of me because I talked to him.

14:10.991 --> 14:16.859
And Peter and I, he invited us in, being a perfect gentleman.

14:16.899 --> 14:17.881
His wife had died.

14:17.941 --> 14:20.484
The younger son hadn't been married yet.

14:21.346 --> 14:23.008
And we were sitting in the living room.

14:25.251 --> 14:27.354
And he said, what brings you fellows down here?

14:28.455 --> 14:32.421
And I said, well, we'd like to have your books that I've collected.

14:32.857 --> 14:34.439
signed on the title page.

14:34.860 --> 14:37.324
He said, wait, wait, wait, wait, I got them all signed in the back.

14:37.344 --> 14:42.331
I said, yes, but won't you sign mine on the title page to make them very unique?

14:44.815 --> 14:45.035
Nope.

14:46.978 --> 14:48.440
Nope.

14:48.460 --> 14:49.241
Sacrilegious.

14:49.982 --> 14:50.423
Nope.

14:50.443 --> 14:51.765
What was sacrilegious about it?

14:51.805 --> 14:53.207
He didn't want, nope.

14:53.227 --> 14:54.749
He designed it this way.

14:54.769 --> 14:55.931
He didn't want it.

14:55.951 --> 14:57.333
He didn't want to fool around with it.

14:57.353 --> 14:58.975
So how did you get him to sign it?

14:59.236 --> 14:59.897
It's very simple.

15:00.237 --> 15:00.838
Peter said,

15:01.679 --> 15:07.067
About 6 o'clock, he said, you know, there's paper dust in this house, don't you have a drink?

15:08.028 --> 15:12.135
Well, neither the father nor the son drank.

15:12.155 --> 15:16.060
So they brought out a half bottle of scotch and a little bourbon, see?

15:16.080 --> 15:18.644
So we started to drink.

15:19.025 --> 15:22.790
Well, I drank the bourbon, Peter drank the scotch, see?

15:22.811 --> 15:24.573
And it got to be about 9.30.

15:24.753 --> 15:27.838
And finally he said, aren't you fellas ever going home?

15:28.898 --> 15:32.282
And Pete looked at him and he said, well, we will as soon as you sign these books.

15:33.703 --> 15:35.826
So the old man said, okay, I'll sign them.

15:35.846 --> 15:37.167
So Peter got up.

15:37.228 --> 15:39.270
I said, no, Pete, you sit in the house.

15:39.490 --> 15:40.511
I'll go out and get the books.

15:40.531 --> 15:41.853
That way they can't lock us out.

15:43.074 --> 15:50.102
So Pete sent him, and I came in with three cartons of books and typed manuscripts and things.

15:50.983 --> 15:55.508
And he signed everything except that one typed manuscript that I had of a talk that he'd given.

15:55.528 --> 15:56.670
He said, I don't remember it.

15:56.710 --> 15:58.652
I won't sign it.

15:59.054 --> 16:00.195
He signed everything else.

16:00.275 --> 16:02.378
Now, I was just... It was something.

16:04.400 --> 16:11.328
His son was up here just about a month ago, and he brought me this letter to get a kick out of it.

16:11.348 --> 16:14.532
So this is Jackson, whoever Jackson is.

16:14.552 --> 16:15.133
I don't know who that is yet.

16:15.153 --> 16:17.396
I haven't had a chance to check this all out.

16:18.457 --> 16:25.345
Now, you read that while I try to sign... Yesterday I had a visitor, a rare occasion.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.147
A rare occasion, which is a visitor.

16:27.167 --> 16:28.909
Well, he doesn't... He never...

16:29.480 --> 16:33.305
He was a retired librarian from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

16:34.026 --> 16:38.311
When Elmer and I were there, see, this is a carbon, see, this is the pre-Xerox days.

16:39.112 --> 16:41.435
In 1954, we had met him, although I'd forgotten.

16:42.917 --> 16:55.153
A week or two ago, this is in the same letter, one, two, three, four, five, the fifth paragraph.

16:56.014 --> 16:56.955
This is in 19...

16:57.205 --> 16:59.730
So he lived into the 60s then, is that right?

17:01.654 --> 17:06.043
A week or two ago, I talked from Cleveland from a man I did not know, his name being Hugo Alpers.

17:06.624 --> 17:11.334
He asked if I would autograph a book or two if he would come down at Chilapati about 350 miles.

17:11.394 --> 17:12.396
Of course I agreed.

17:12.646 --> 17:18.293
In a few days he arrived with two huge cartons of books, all from my private press or from the Pinson printers.

17:18.873 --> 17:20.295
I was amazed to see what he had.

17:20.335 --> 17:34.151
Three copies of the literature of papermaking, 1925, four copies of primitive papermaking, 1927, and duplicates of many of my other books, including six copies each of the two books Elmer had done, 1936 and 1939.

17:35.252 --> 17:40.358
He wanted them all autographed on the title pages, and although I objected to this particular spot,

17:40.338 --> 17:42.081
He insisted, and I complied.

17:42.722 --> 17:44.304
All of the books were in mint condition.

17:44.364 --> 17:46.667
He said he would buy any books of mine that were offered.

17:47.028 --> 17:49.652
What strange turns book collecting can take!

17:51.434 --> 17:55.721
Please forgive a badly typed letter, as I'm not only writing in the dark, but I'm using only one eye today.

17:56.281 --> 18:05.535
And this is April 30th, MCMLXV, which is 1965, from Chillicothe, O'Hara, addressed to Dear Jacksonville.

18:05.954 --> 18:11.400
So this is a typescript, a carbon copy of a wire, apparently, that he sent out.

18:12.081 --> 18:15.465
The Darren Hunter stuff basically occupied this stuff.

18:15.985 --> 18:18.909
Yes.

18:19.129 --> 18:20.791
How many books did he do?

18:21.111 --> 18:24.535
Do you have a sense of... Oh yeah, I have... I can tell you that.

18:24.555 --> 18:25.836
And you have everything, I assume?

18:26.437 --> 18:27.478
Oh yeah.

18:27.498 --> 18:28.559
There's nothing you don't have?

18:29.881 --> 18:31.222
No.

18:31.242 --> 18:32.704
How about designs and stuff?

18:33.089 --> 18:35.934
Does his son have that, or his grandson?

18:35.954 --> 18:38.679
No, his grandson has everything.

18:39.500 --> 18:41.965
But you've thought about trying to get that stuff.

18:41.985 --> 18:49.799
No, his father offered some of that for sale one time to me, and I told him I wouldn't buy it, he should keep it for his son.

18:49.819 --> 18:52.604
And he did keep it for his son.

18:52.624 --> 18:54.928
And...

18:55.853 --> 18:56.634
I'm surprised.

18:57.455 --> 18:59.137
Well, he got hard up for money.

18:59.237 --> 19:02.021
But I'm surprised that you didn't make an offer for it.

19:02.061 --> 19:04.224
No, I wouldn't do it.

19:04.244 --> 19:04.925
I told him no.

19:05.125 --> 19:08.590
I knew him well enough that I could tell him, don't do this.

19:09.151 --> 19:10.132
You're going to regret it.

19:11.634 --> 19:13.677
As much as you probably would love to own it.

19:14.217 --> 19:15.279
I would have loved to own it.

19:16.841 --> 19:20.005
We had some financial deals, so I helped him out at the time.

19:21.115 --> 19:23.482
So you became very, very friendly then with the family.

19:23.502 --> 19:23.843
Oh, I know.

19:23.924 --> 19:24.506
Very close.

19:24.786 --> 19:25.529
Very close.

19:25.549 --> 19:26.973
So that was the introduction.

19:27.013 --> 19:30.083
So did you go see Senior again?

19:30.123 --> 19:33.032
I saw Senior a number of times.

19:33.198 --> 19:40.067
Did he ever talk about the day he signed all these books?

19:40.367 --> 19:41.369
He'd always look at me.

19:41.389 --> 19:43.191
He basically signed them to get rid of you, right?

19:43.451 --> 19:44.072
He had to.

19:44.132 --> 19:45.153
I wasn't going to leave.

19:46.215 --> 19:48.277
And he'd always say, you haven't got any more.

19:48.297 --> 19:49.159
I'm not going to do it.

19:49.699 --> 19:51.522
It is kind of sacrilege, though, isn't it?

19:51.582 --> 19:56.208
I understand that a lot of people don't like to fool with a page.

19:56.348 --> 19:57.950
But I thought I'd make mine unique.

19:57.990 --> 19:58.851
You didn't know that.

19:58.831 --> 19:59.974
Well, I didn't care.

20:00.014 --> 20:01.096
I wanted it for my daughter.

20:01.357 --> 20:04.685
I figured I could always get Einstein copies on the title page.

20:04.705 --> 20:06.068
The fact that he did it is amazing.

20:06.148 --> 20:06.749
Yes.

20:07.652 --> 20:08.273
And how old were you?

20:08.293 --> 20:09.516
You were just a kid at the time.

20:09.536 --> 20:09.957
65.

20:09.977 --> 20:10.458
That's 1961.

20:10.538 --> 20:11.841
That's 31 years ago.

20:11.861 --> 20:12.683
65.

20:12.784 --> 20:14.187
Let's see.

20:14.848 --> 20:16.452
I was 30, 37.

20:16.820 --> 20:19.202
at the time, just shortly after I got married.

20:19.282 --> 20:20.904
So you were collecting then.

20:20.944 --> 20:25.428
You came out of the service, you told me, this morning, with the idea of already knowing what I wanted.

20:25.468 --> 20:30.633
And you gave one particular bookseller hell because he didn't save stuff for you, my dart hunter.

20:31.053 --> 20:31.454
Yes.

20:31.474 --> 20:31.934
Is that right?

20:32.054 --> 20:33.636
Yes, I wanted my dart hunters.

20:34.917 --> 20:43.705
And so then what he did is he made me buy the catalogs to Park Burnett.

20:44.208 --> 20:57.499
And he said, now here's the way you learn, because they have the estimate, the description, and then they will give you back the results at a later time.

20:58.100 --> 21:14.113
And so slowly I began to become familiar with how a catalog was written, the words, and, you know, reading a catalog is very tricky because you have to know who wrote the catalog, because what is good to me is

21:14.515 --> 21:18.379
fair to you and is poor to the next man, so you have to know the catalog.

21:18.399 --> 21:20.060
You know, I've never seen this book.

21:20.281 --> 21:21.622
It's 1943.

21:21.762 --> 21:24.705
The Dart Hunter Museum now is down in Atlanta.

21:25.586 --> 21:25.726
Uh-huh.

21:25.746 --> 21:30.030
If you're down in Atlanta, you want to give a call to Jim Slife.

21:30.931 --> 21:31.571
In Atlanta?

21:31.772 --> 21:43.543
In Atlanta, because it used to be at MIT, and it got, they, his whole collection, and wire screens and everything else.

21:44.148 --> 21:46.150
Let me just read this here.

21:46.550 --> 21:57.041
Dart Hunter is the outstanding authority on paper and papermaking in the world today, in all probability the most ardent exponent of this ancient craft who has ever lived.

21:58.062 --> 21:58.843
That's what it says here.

21:59.503 --> 22:06.190
He was born in Steubenville, Ohio in 1883, the sixth successive generation of a family of printers and publishers.

22:06.290 --> 22:07.131
I love this already.

22:07.711 --> 22:11.455
He was educated at the Ohio State University, and it goes on.

22:11.637 --> 22:19.528
Bababa originally trained as a topographer, he early became interested in paper and papermaking and has studied this industry in virtually every part of the globe.

22:20.169 --> 22:27.600
He has traveled to the far corners of the earth in search of tools, appliances, and equipment used by papermakers and specimens of their products.

22:28.181 --> 22:39.197
This quest has taken him to every papermaking country in Europe, to China, Korea, Indochina, Manchuria, Siam, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, the Netherlands, East Indies,

22:39.565 --> 22:42.488
Many of the Netherlands, East Indies is one phrase.

22:42.989 --> 22:50.978
Many of the native states of India to Central America, Mexico, Africa, Arabia, New Zealand, and scores of islands of the South Pacific Ocean.

22:50.998 --> 22:52.420
That's unbelievable, isn't it?

22:53.021 --> 22:54.062
For that period of time.

22:55.103 --> 23:04.594
In addition, Mr. Hunter is a zealous craftsman in every aspect of bookmaking, author, illustrator, type designer, punch cutter, founder, paper maker, and printer.

23:04.844 --> 23:12.513
He has produced books in which every step in the making, from the writing to the finished product, has been undertaken entirely unaided.

23:12.533 --> 23:19.321
It is authoritatively stated that he is the only individual in the world's history who has achieved this unique accomplishment.

23:19.522 --> 23:20.302
I have to write about him.

23:20.483 --> 23:22.605
He's got to be in my book.

23:22.625 --> 23:23.626
He's got to be in my book.

23:24.608 --> 23:26.650
I say this with the machine running right now.

23:27.153 --> 23:41.820
For many years, he maintained a studio in his home in Chillicothe, Ohio, where he issued limited editions of books produced in this manner and where he assembled an amazingly complete collection of papers and papermaking tools and equipment from all parts of the world.

23:42.104 --> 23:48.490
In 1939, this collection was established in the MIT, where it forms the Dard-Hunter Paper Museum.

23:48.550 --> 23:50.051
So it's no longer there at MIT?

23:50.432 --> 23:51.232
No, no.

23:51.352 --> 23:54.235
So the family moved it, or MIT lost it, or what?

23:54.275 --> 23:55.056
MIT lost it.

23:55.076 --> 23:57.198
They screwed around, and they put it in the basement.

23:57.378 --> 24:00.921
So I could go see this thing in 45 minutes, and now I've got to go to Atlanta.

24:01.442 --> 24:09.529
Well, then it went to Appleton, Wisconsin, and then finally that didn't work out, and it ended up in Atlanta, where they built a special...

24:09.813 --> 24:11.675
It's worth a trip to Atlanta for me.

24:11.976 --> 24:18.083
Mr. Hunter is the compiler of more than 16 books and brochures on the various aspects of paper and papermaking.

24:18.584 --> 24:23.790
The present volume is the first to be issued in a commercial edition at a price within the means of the general reader.

24:24.230 --> 24:29.216
And this is titled, Papermaking, the History and Technique of an Ancient Craft by Darren Hunter.

24:29.377 --> 24:30.558
It's Alfred A. Knopf.

24:30.578 --> 24:32.460
It's a bourgeois book.

24:32.480 --> 24:34.863
And it is 1943.

24:35.224 --> 24:37.406
I'm going to have to get a copy of this.

24:37.566 --> 24:38.908
I'm on it already.

24:39.614 --> 24:40.375
Excellent.

24:40.595 --> 24:42.558
That's very, very, very interesting.

24:43.099 --> 24:44.661
Now, this is my life with paper.

24:46.163 --> 24:47.265
That's an autobiography.

24:47.285 --> 24:49.067
That sounds pretty interesting, too.

24:50.309 --> 24:52.572
You should sign these all probably up at Harvard.

24:52.713 --> 24:53.213
Oh, I will.

24:53.554 --> 24:55.196
This is 1957.

24:55.436 --> 24:56.017
Oh, I'm sure.

24:56.478 --> 25:01.605
I read at the Boston Athenaeum, which has everything as well.

25:02.186 --> 25:04.529
Did I put that in the wrong place?

25:04.549 --> 25:06.632
No, it's okay.

25:06.652 --> 25:06.813
Okay.

25:07.093 --> 25:08.575
So you're going to...

25:09.280 --> 25:10.101
That's what I would do.

25:10.142 --> 25:12.346
I would go up there and just start to read on it.

25:12.947 --> 25:17.835
Was he recognized at this level when you started collecting him?

25:22.203 --> 25:30.077
I think to a certain select hue in the library profession and private collectors.

25:30.618 --> 25:33.263
Now, he was an honorary member of the Roe Fonk.

25:33.462 --> 25:47.162
So there are a number of Roe founders that did buy his book when it came out, and they donated them after a period of time to the Art Museum or the Cleveland Public Library or Western Reserve Historical.

25:49.465 --> 25:55.774
But I think when there was a resurgence of

25:56.125 --> 26:04.174
you know, book finding and all of this business and paper making back in the 70s, all of a sudden he became very popular again.

26:04.655 --> 26:09.080
As you know, everything in the book cycles are up and down, up and down, up and down.

26:09.780 --> 26:17.189
Right now, I would say Dard Hunter is on the down, he's on the down, in the down part of the cycle.

26:17.449 --> 26:18.010
Why is that?

26:19.451 --> 26:22.875
Because people are, you know,

26:23.108 --> 26:24.050
The Vogue is out.

26:24.110 --> 26:25.414
It's out of Vogue right now.

26:25.474 --> 26:28.180
It'll come back again, probably with the next generation.

26:29.102 --> 26:40.249
Right now, everyone is into, you know, prints and this modern business, which I hate to say I don't understand.

26:40.269 --> 26:41.151
I have a trouble...

26:41.401 --> 26:52.432
So did you see that there's any scholarly use for the elements of this collection, or do you think it's pretty well covered in major collections?

26:52.532 --> 26:58.097
That's not the kind of thing that you feel that you'd want to see deposited in a... My self?

26:58.277 --> 26:58.518
Yeah.

26:58.618 --> 27:03.262
No, I don't believe in giving to any of the public libraries or universities or colleges.

27:03.302 --> 27:10.429
I never would, because once it goes to a college or a university, it seldomly comes out again, which means that

27:10.814 --> 27:18.322
Had these all been sold to universities or colleges or what have you, I would have never had the chance of doing the collections.

27:18.863 --> 27:24.468
And as we said at Jan's place, all the great collections are done by individuals.

27:24.508 --> 27:28.152
They're never done by universities, colleges, or what have you.

27:28.313 --> 27:36.401
They're all individuals who have that narrow focus, if you will, and the drive to accomplish this.

27:36.541 --> 27:39.184
So your goal is to see this

27:39.367 --> 27:42.371
go on in the life cycle in the collecting world.

27:42.391 --> 27:46.797
I mean, to replenish the stock of, oh, that's your daughters, you know.

27:46.817 --> 27:47.458
Yeah, my daughters.

27:47.478 --> 27:57.131
I mean, these cases are built, so if you take this band off, the kickboard, the top comes off, and this all separates into one, two, three, four.

27:57.491 --> 27:58.412
The ends come off.

27:58.432 --> 28:01.016
They can move the whole thing out if they want, or they can leave it here.

28:02.898 --> 28:07.905
Because this room is all used, basically, the front face.

28:08.189 --> 28:10.913
beams came out of a state here in Cleveland.

28:11.353 --> 28:15.339
And then I lengthened those, see, from there to there, and I spent hours.

28:15.459 --> 28:16.301
You did this yourself?

28:17.102 --> 28:18.744
With a carpenter who showed me how to do it.

28:18.984 --> 28:22.810
And then I spent hours here filing them.

28:22.910 --> 28:26.355
I see the seams now that you point them out, but I would never have noticed them before.

28:26.375 --> 28:37.791
Filing them in, so they all came in, and then, you know, scraping them, and then with the wool, and then the, this has all come drained right over.

28:38.412 --> 28:39.453
What do you call it again?

28:39.513 --> 28:41.015
Comb, grain, white oak.

28:41.475 --> 28:41.896
Combed.

28:42.396 --> 28:42.776
Combed.

28:42.836 --> 28:43.858
Which means it's straight.

28:45.119 --> 28:46.340
Grain, white oak.

28:46.360 --> 28:46.981
It's beautiful.

28:47.882 --> 28:51.605
And the panels, they were damaged in shipment.

28:52.046 --> 28:57.491
These were 5 foot by 10 foot, and I bought them for, you know, because they were damaged.

28:57.551 --> 28:58.512
They didn't want them.

28:59.573 --> 29:01.275
These were all solid cars.

29:02.536 --> 29:03.137
Solid what?

29:03.522 --> 29:04.923
It's plywood.

29:04.943 --> 29:05.404
Oh, I see.

29:05.444 --> 29:06.605
And it's solid core.

29:06.625 --> 29:12.010
I mean, many of the pieces of plywood, you know, have some kind of a substance.

29:12.090 --> 29:15.534
Well, they have substance, but there's also voids in there and everything.

29:15.574 --> 29:17.856
This is all solid three-quarter inch plywood.

29:19.377 --> 29:21.860
And so we put this room together.

29:21.880 --> 29:23.761
I spent a long time on this room.

29:24.742 --> 29:30.688
And then the furniture was brought from an estate sale here.

29:30.708 --> 29:32.770
And this is all hand-carved.

29:33.155 --> 29:36.298
Romer Brooks, and I have the book on that.

29:39.281 --> 29:44.125
The rug came out of Rockefeller's dining room when he closed the house up in Forest Hills here.

29:44.145 --> 29:44.566
Oh, really?

29:44.606 --> 29:45.727
Right.

29:45.747 --> 29:55.696
And so all of this stuff here, you know, means something to me because I collected it over years, trying to eventually put this room together.

29:56.017 --> 29:56.277
Wow.

29:56.317 --> 29:57.258
And when was this room?

29:58.579 --> 29:59.500
Twenty years ago.

30:00.188 --> 30:01.449
I finished this in 75.

30:01.510 --> 30:03.792
That's a beautiful painting over there, the Indian.

30:04.453 --> 30:04.553
Yeah.

30:04.573 --> 30:05.174
Now, who's that?

30:05.274 --> 30:05.794
It's Kaus.

30:07.416 --> 30:08.578
It's all Jack Barfield.

30:09.479 --> 30:10.760
And there's bison over there.

30:12.622 --> 30:18.129
Yeah, that is, remember, that's Hayes.

30:19.470 --> 30:20.772
Jay Hayes, that's wonderful.

30:21.272 --> 30:23.054
Look at the grid, huh?

30:23.074 --> 30:24.015
That's the way they were?

30:24.055 --> 30:24.376
Yeah.

30:25.337 --> 30:25.857
That's great.

30:25.877 --> 30:27.259
It's big, so it's nice.

30:28.117 --> 30:30.301
So let's proceed along on the collection.

30:30.361 --> 30:33.125
Is this the cornerstone of the collection, in your view?

30:33.145 --> 30:33.406
Right.

30:33.486 --> 30:37.552
You know, from printing, you go to papermaking on this.

30:38.634 --> 30:40.156
Oh, I thought we were doing papermaking.

30:40.176 --> 30:41.859
I mean, from papermaking to printing.

30:42.059 --> 30:42.420
Okay.

30:42.560 --> 30:45.184
So these are all books that are having to do with printing.

30:46.326 --> 30:49.712
Not all the time, because that's a whole Rosenbach collection over there.

30:50.293 --> 30:52.977
While I didn't know him, I knew John Fleming very well.

30:54.965 --> 30:59.850
You know, personally, the kids were up there already, and we had dinner and lunches at his place.

31:01.871 --> 31:03.293
And I noticed these are doubles.

31:03.313 --> 31:04.254
You have duplicates.

31:04.274 --> 31:04.454
Oh, yeah.

31:05.435 --> 31:07.297
The Mill on the Third River, whatever that is.

31:07.317 --> 31:08.478
Well, that is the cardboard.

31:08.738 --> 31:12.161
That's still in existence, the Davey Board Company.

31:12.201 --> 31:15.965
When we had the bookbinding company, that's where I bought all the cardboard from.

31:15.985 --> 31:24.853
So naturally, when they came out with the history of the company, I got two copies immediately, because that's what is used in all the boards for the books.

31:26.200 --> 31:30.887
And these have to do with, those are reference books on the side.

31:31.428 --> 31:36.996
These have to do with book binding and the care of books and all that.

31:37.016 --> 31:43.366
Well, there's a lot of dibdin here, and these are all double shelves, so you made these deep enough to handle everything.

31:43.386 --> 31:45.890
Hopefully, but it never does.

31:46.250 --> 31:48.293
I have that set of bibliomania.

31:48.333 --> 31:48.874
That's nice.

31:48.894 --> 31:49.876
That's four volumes.

31:49.916 --> 31:52.039
There's a fourth volume over there.

31:53.048 --> 32:01.876
So we're into binding now in care, I noticed, creative bookbinding, the final solution to all problems by Alpers.

32:01.936 --> 32:07.380
Is that what it is?

32:07.420 --> 32:09.102
Yeah.

32:09.342 --> 32:11.184
Alpers.

32:12.985 --> 32:14.426
Oh, that's funny.

32:15.147 --> 32:15.567
You see now?

32:15.888 --> 32:18.270
That's a folio size, but the piece is missing.

32:18.730 --> 32:21.412
Well, that's because it's in another room right now.

32:21.913 --> 32:22.093
Okay.

32:22.445 --> 32:30.056
You know, Arnold Werner, I don't know if you know, Arnold Werner used to do all the... Oh, that's so funny.

32:31.258 --> 32:33.782
Arnold Werner?

32:33.802 --> 32:34.543
That's so funny.

32:35.604 --> 32:39.190
I've got to tell you, that's really very funny.

32:39.210 --> 32:43.216
Where did you get the idea from this?

32:43.696 --> 32:47.382
Well, this friend of mine who runs the Cold Firearms.

32:47.402 --> 32:48.063
Yeah.

32:48.083 --> 32:49.465
Yeah, I told you about the Bible.

32:50.407 --> 32:55.776
And then when I was doing nuclear work, you were not allowed to carry any of the stuff into the facilities.

32:56.918 --> 32:58.721
And we had tremendous arguments.

32:59.142 --> 33:02.588
We were talking about a ten-thousandths in deviation and everything else.

33:03.068 --> 33:07.155
So I carried this one in one day, and I laid it on the table.

33:08.578 --> 33:12.184
These were before the days of metal detectors, too, probably.

33:12.204 --> 33:13.206
They didn't.

33:13.286 --> 33:15.790
It was a screw-up.

33:16.310 --> 33:19.934
The ultimate?

33:19.954 --> 33:20.274
DSR.

33:20.374 --> 33:30.083
DSR is a discrepancy report, and we would be arguing over a thousand, ten thousand deviation over here or there on a part, see?

33:30.103 --> 33:31.205
And you can make it grow.

33:31.225 --> 33:36.169
If you put a hand on metal, you can make it bigger, or you cool the room down, you can shrink it.

33:36.510 --> 33:37.951
Ten thousand isn't very much.

33:37.991 --> 33:41.214
Your hair is two thousand thick, basically.

33:41.615 --> 33:43.937
You have fine hair three thousandths in this course.

33:45.470 --> 33:47.693
So I came in with this, and they said, what's this?

33:47.773 --> 33:53.340
I said, I'm keeping track of all these discrepancy reports and how we have to answer them.

33:53.981 --> 33:55.323
The guy said, can I see your book?

33:55.383 --> 33:56.144
And I gave it to him.

33:57.045 --> 33:59.869
And he went like, is that real?

33:59.889 --> 34:02.813
I said, if one of these is missing, you know I'm really mad.

34:06.598 --> 34:08.601
They stopped the whole meeting.

34:08.801 --> 34:10.403
And they said, how did you get it in?

34:10.423 --> 34:12.726
I said, well, I just walked in.

34:12.976 --> 34:15.879
Let's see, it looks like a book out here.

34:16.699 --> 34:16.900
Yeah.

34:16.920 --> 34:21.564
Arno Werner, he was a finebinder for Harvard University.

34:22.265 --> 34:24.386
Then his daughter married Larry Wilson.

34:24.467 --> 34:27.850
He moved down to Hadley in Connecticut.

34:29.391 --> 34:32.654
He did some of the papermaking in America.

34:32.774 --> 34:33.835
Frank didn't do them all.

34:34.176 --> 34:38.760
Arno just died about a year ago, and I'd see Arno periodically.

34:40.121 --> 34:41.262
Arno made this up for me.

34:42.423 --> 34:43.445
That's fun.

34:45.849 --> 34:49.837
So this is basically a history of the book collection, would you say?

34:49.877 --> 34:54.766
From... to every aspect.

34:55.327 --> 34:58.132
So you have some Dibdins here, I noticed.

34:58.152 --> 34:59.334
Do you have an 1809 Dibdin?

34:59.875 --> 35:00.997
I don't really remember.

35:01.158 --> 35:01.679
Tough one.

35:02.019 --> 35:06.287
That could be it back there, that big one.

35:07.600 --> 35:09.802
Oh, that's Spencer Library one.

35:09.902 --> 35:13.105
In fact, Dibdin was the cataloger for that.

35:13.145 --> 35:14.406
That's a beautiful cataloger.

35:14.426 --> 35:14.906
I love that.

35:17.268 --> 35:18.750
I really don't know.

35:18.770 --> 35:19.230
I don't look.

35:19.470 --> 35:19.971
That's okay.

35:19.991 --> 35:20.611
I'm just curious.

35:20.711 --> 35:22.133
But you do have a lot of Dibdin.

35:22.153 --> 35:24.975
These are, you know, very, this one's like a forage.

35:26.476 --> 35:26.837
What is it?

35:26.877 --> 35:27.417
Forage.

35:27.477 --> 35:28.818
You've seen forage.

35:28.838 --> 35:29.679
Oh, okay.

35:29.699 --> 35:30.680
Oh, absolutely.

35:30.820 --> 35:32.902
This is a binding, you know, this.

35:33.863 --> 35:35.124
You see, they're all different types.

35:35.544 --> 35:37.506
These are samples of binding.

35:38.363 --> 35:43.209
But the fun is, you know, everyone drinks wine.

35:44.270 --> 35:46.273
So I collect books on brewing beer.

35:46.694 --> 35:47.394
Brewing beer.

35:47.414 --> 35:48.676
Well, that's your good heritage.

35:49.016 --> 35:54.103
So, naturally, here's the one you have to have on fermentation.

35:54.123 --> 35:54.964
Louis Pasteur.

35:56.286 --> 35:57.707
And that's the title of it is?

35:58.949 --> 36:04.636
Well, this is the volume that they did on pasteurization, fermentation.

36:05.778 --> 36:06.058
You see?

36:07.996 --> 36:08.737
Classic work.

36:08.937 --> 36:10.580
That's how he felt.

36:10.600 --> 36:12.402
Nobody's been able to tell me how to do this.

36:12.422 --> 36:15.306
No, that's easy.

36:15.566 --> 36:18.550
K-E-I-S-O-G-L-O-F-F.

36:19.091 --> 36:19.652
L-O-F-F.

36:19.672 --> 36:23.297
And he was the big Cleveland John F. He was the main man.

36:23.317 --> 36:25.840
He knew them all.

36:26.061 --> 36:29.966
He knew John met his wife at Rosenbach's.

36:31.348 --> 36:31.628
Right?

36:31.829 --> 36:37.176
And Peter remembers John when he was just a young man.

36:38.287 --> 36:40.669
and they'd go out to lunch together.

36:40.689 --> 36:43.332
He knew John before he got married.

36:44.013 --> 36:54.863
And his wife, as I said, worked at Rosenbach's, and here's the earliest track on beer.

36:56.044 --> 36:59.507
And that is, whew, I can't pronounce it.

36:59.527 --> 37:03.712
Barliest, the earliest track on beer, dematurist, whatever.

37:03.812 --> 37:05.273
Okay, I'll take your word for it.

37:05.658 --> 37:07.640
You know, and so you start... Well, you've got St.

37:07.700 --> 37:08.401
Augustine here.

37:08.581 --> 37:10.784
Is that a Jensen, Nicholas Jensen?

37:10.804 --> 37:12.045
Oh, yeah.

37:12.065 --> 37:15.109
Oh, you've got some stuff here, Hugo, that you're not telling me about.

37:16.450 --> 37:17.892
You're being very shy here.

37:18.453 --> 37:21.036
Well, you know, I'm not going to go through the whole thing.

37:21.056 --> 37:21.416
That's St.

37:21.516 --> 37:23.419
Augustine de Civitate.

37:23.699 --> 37:26.542
Here, this is the one that I get a kicker.

37:26.562 --> 37:33.370
Rare original horn book with exhibition books, early 18th century, one of the few horn books with pedigree.

37:34.328 --> 37:35.951
Oh, look at that.

37:36.852 --> 37:38.495
And this is the box that was mailed in.

37:39.877 --> 37:41.019
Wow.

37:41.700 --> 37:43.944
And what's the date on it, do we think?

37:44.024 --> 37:46.468
Oh, I don't know.

37:46.488 --> 37:48.271
Not the date, but approximately.

37:49.012 --> 37:50.274
I don't really know.

37:50.294 --> 37:51.036
Look at the stamps.

37:51.096 --> 37:53.079
It's still got stamps on it, for God's sakes.

37:56.064 --> 37:56.725
That's wonderful.

38:01.075 --> 38:04.320
The Wood Beyond the World, whatever it is.

38:05.081 --> 38:05.482
Which one?

38:05.702 --> 38:08.026
I'm just looking at the Wood Beyond the World.

38:08.046 --> 38:09.028
That's William Morris.

38:09.749 --> 38:10.330
Oh, okay.

38:11.111 --> 38:17.321
Yeah, and there's... What are those Dantes way back there, those two big folios, without getting them?

38:17.642 --> 38:17.962
Which one?

38:18.443 --> 38:19.645
Those two, they're orange.

38:19.685 --> 38:20.947
They're like an orange moron.

38:20.967 --> 38:24.573
Oh, those, I don't know what that one is.

38:24.593 --> 38:26.135
I think those years ago, I haven't looked at them here.

38:26.155 --> 38:27.758
There's the...

38:32.800 --> 38:37.767
Liber Scriptorium Authors Club Faust.

38:37.787 --> 38:38.688
What is that Faust?

38:41.792 --> 38:42.553
I don't know.

38:42.573 --> 38:43.134
It is a printer.

38:44.115 --> 38:44.796
God only knows.

38:45.457 --> 38:47.921
Doug's Press or something.

38:47.941 --> 38:56.432
I put them up many years ago, and, you know, I don't get to these only certain sections during the winter months when there's snow.

38:57.834 --> 38:59.196
So it's been a long time since.

38:59.615 --> 39:02.038
I've been in that because I've been working over and there.

39:02.159 --> 39:06.585
I don't know that book, A Study of Rare Books by Noli Mummey, M-U-M-E-Y.

39:16.980 --> 39:18.162
What's the air in it?

39:20.885 --> 39:21.466
Let's see.

39:25.232 --> 39:27.174
We've got 1930.

39:27.194 --> 39:28.176
Noli Mummey.

39:28.516 --> 39:28.997
I've never heard of him.

39:31.103 --> 39:31.784
I'm interested.

39:33.906 --> 39:34.667
It's English.

39:34.687 --> 39:35.387
Oh, it's gorgeous.

39:35.488 --> 39:36.248
Oh, my God.

39:36.308 --> 39:38.270
Look at that, huh?

39:38.290 --> 39:38.431
Yes.

39:38.451 --> 39:42.074
Well, it says it was February to colophons, prestidizing, title pages.

39:42.094 --> 39:44.096
19.

39:44.597 --> 39:45.138
It's beautiful.

39:46.619 --> 39:48.081
It's a beautiful book.

39:48.101 --> 39:49.082
1930, right?

39:50.583 --> 39:50.723
Mm-hmm.

39:50.743 --> 39:54.307
He's actually studying the typography, I guess, and the colophon.

39:56.569 --> 39:58.191
Okay.

39:59.605 --> 40:01.308
So you've really got a whole double shelf.

40:02.270 --> 40:03.853
These don't slide out, these shelves.

40:03.993 --> 40:05.496
No, you have to take them out to get them.

40:05.536 --> 40:09.042
But like Peeps, you put the big ones in back and the small ones in front.

40:09.523 --> 40:10.445
Yeah, you try to get them.

40:10.465 --> 40:13.150
So the shelf in the back is raised about three inches.

40:13.190 --> 40:14.632
So you can see the titles.

40:14.652 --> 40:18.800
That's why the lights are this way rather than on the top because now they'll shine back.

40:18.900 --> 40:20.202
And you design these cases.

40:20.423 --> 40:20.663
Oh, yeah.

40:20.864 --> 40:22.647
This is all marine.

40:22.667 --> 40:22.727
Oh.

40:27.162 --> 40:28.924
This is English literature.

40:28.944 --> 40:31.167
This is American over here.

40:31.347 --> 40:32.909
We have an Uncle Tom's cabin.

40:33.910 --> 40:35.812
Now, do you have these cases made for them?

40:36.473 --> 40:38.115
No, most of them I bought that way.

40:39.116 --> 40:42.360
You have quadrupeds of North America, three volumes.

40:43.521 --> 40:46.584
A book of trout flies by Jennings, which I've heard of.

40:47.726 --> 40:51.110
And then you've got these Franklin imprints down here.

40:51.130 --> 40:52.952
Benjamin Franklin imprints, of course.

40:53.532 --> 40:54.454
I have this book.

40:54.474 --> 40:55.735
I picked that up at an auction.

40:55.985 --> 41:00.252
It's a bibliograph of a philosophical society, I guess.

41:01.014 --> 41:02.436
Franklin imprints are very nice.

41:03.518 --> 41:06.343
You have to have some in the library to make a fill in.

41:06.643 --> 41:09.308
How about Isaiah Thomas, my old Worcester Mass?

41:09.648 --> 41:11.171
Yeah, I have some stuff.

41:11.311 --> 41:11.632
I don't know.

41:11.652 --> 41:13.174
Because he was certainly significant.

41:13.214 --> 41:15.558
He didn't do beautiful work, to me, but everybody.

41:17.722 --> 41:18.243
Let's see now.

41:18.303 --> 41:21.368
You wanted Bill Womley.

41:22.141 --> 41:24.264
He spelled his name for me.

41:24.464 --> 41:26.027
Who did you need now?

41:26.087 --> 41:31.515
You wanted... No, I think I've got John Linseth, too.

41:31.695 --> 41:32.356
You have his?

41:32.476 --> 41:32.776
Yeah.

41:33.217 --> 41:33.658
Okay.

41:36.522 --> 41:39.907
It's not going to matter much anyway if I can't use it, so... Right.

41:39.927 --> 41:43.472
This is the last yearbook that we did with letterpress.

41:43.492 --> 41:46.376
This is the one when I was the president.

41:46.757 --> 41:47.598
This is our house.

41:47.658 --> 41:49.301
This is the parking lot that we finished.

41:49.321 --> 41:49.461
No.

41:50.502 --> 41:50.983
In here.

41:51.757 --> 41:57.643
And Shad Hardwell, in memory of his father, he put a stained glass window in there.

41:57.663 --> 41:59.324
And you'll see that in here.

42:00.025 --> 42:01.786
And this is the last one.

42:01.887 --> 42:04.689
It's done by letterpress after that.

42:05.470 --> 42:11.175
And these were all handmade and figured by John Sabota.

42:11.415 --> 42:12.056
It's wonderful.

42:13.277 --> 42:16.500
This is basically all Roe Fon publications.

42:16.580 --> 42:18.422
Let me just count this.

42:19.010 --> 42:24.277
So on the side cases of the alcoves, you call these alcoves?

42:24.858 --> 42:25.939
Yeah, whatever you want.

42:26.259 --> 42:29.383
But these are all row farm publications from here up.

42:29.443 --> 42:31.246
Those are the yearbooks down to there.

42:31.766 --> 42:35.291
These are the various publications that the club has done throughout the year.

42:35.872 --> 42:39.797
Then, of course, I get into my riverboats.

42:39.917 --> 42:43.882
And then down here is I started a collection once of mummies.

42:44.483 --> 42:48.628
I was going to make a complaint department down at work, you know.

42:48.811 --> 42:49.612
Talk to the mummy.

42:53.597 --> 42:54.899
Can you tell me about the debris?

42:55.039 --> 42:59.284
These are early exploration volumes.

42:59.304 --> 43:01.207
This is basically exploration.

43:01.287 --> 43:03.450
This, as you can see, is still some printing stuff.

43:04.731 --> 43:06.634
These are the volumes.

43:06.674 --> 43:09.758
They have the original journal of the Lewis and Clark Expedition.

43:09.778 --> 43:10.819
That's very nice.

43:12.121 --> 43:12.982
They just came out.

43:13.002 --> 43:17.788
They have the coliforms up there, which I have.

43:18.494 --> 43:19.435
Very, very nice.

43:19.936 --> 43:20.296
Very nice.

43:20.316 --> 43:23.220
And this is basically Cleveland, Ohio.

43:23.320 --> 43:24.221
Ohio exploration.

43:25.143 --> 43:27.486
And there's a street, your catalog's back there.

43:27.626 --> 43:28.807
And this is Western.

43:28.827 --> 43:32.132
You know, because some of the people... Well, that's Parkman.

43:32.212 --> 43:33.293
You have some Parkman there.

43:33.794 --> 43:33.914
Right.

43:33.934 --> 43:37.479
Because this is... A lot of these people I met through Jack Barfields.

43:37.999 --> 43:38.140
Mm-hmm.

43:38.660 --> 43:41.784
You know, I did get to meet Harold McCracken.

43:42.826 --> 43:48.433
And, you know, many of these...

43:48.532 --> 43:54.700
Things are autographed to me because, as I said, we'd go up three or four times a year when Peter was on a buying trip.

43:55.601 --> 43:56.262
We'd just go up.

43:57.344 --> 44:00.288
And I'd hold his bag and then start to learn.

44:01.749 --> 44:02.751
That's great.

44:03.892 --> 44:06.195
And it's been, you've never tired of it?

44:06.336 --> 44:09.340
It's never something that's... No, I just don't have enough money.

44:09.520 --> 44:12.363
Everything's gotten so damn expensive.

44:12.384 --> 44:13.405
You have a want list?

44:13.525 --> 44:15.788
I mean, there are things that... I can't afford them.

44:16.139 --> 44:18.122
so you just don't allow yourself to have it.

44:18.462 --> 44:21.306
I'm interested in this Nazi thing over here.

44:21.426 --> 44:22.288
Somebody gave me this.

44:22.448 --> 44:32.362
This is basically a promotion, let's see, from a second lieutenant to a first lieutenant.

44:33.343 --> 44:35.406
I didn't think that Hitler would sign that.

44:35.646 --> 44:40.393
No, but it's very close to this, but I have to check it out.

44:40.473 --> 44:45.420
Somebody gave me this thing, you know, and it's very close to his signature.

44:45.856 --> 44:51.344
So it's just one of those things that have to be done at a certain day, tomorrow, maybe next year.

44:51.925 --> 44:53.527
This one, somebody gave me this.

44:55.189 --> 44:56.992
Because this is an interesting thing.

44:57.552 --> 45:00.857
Because this had a beer ad in here.

45:02.920 --> 45:04.382
So you're interested in beer, huh?

45:05.023 --> 45:06.946
Well, I don't like wine, so I drink beer.

45:06.966 --> 45:11.192
Of course, my gutters are a wine kind of source.

45:11.252 --> 45:12.994
The Budweiser ad.

45:14.543 --> 45:15.284
Buy the case.

45:15.324 --> 45:16.105
Deliver it to your home.

45:16.165 --> 45:16.926
Buy the case.

45:18.607 --> 45:19.809
So it's pretty low.

45:19.829 --> 45:21.491
You've got a four-digit telephone number.

45:21.571 --> 45:21.871
Right.

45:21.891 --> 45:22.752
Still, there's no one.

45:22.772 --> 45:25.375
It says, Be Ready.

45:27.737 --> 45:28.278
Oh, Be Ready.

45:28.438 --> 45:28.678
Sure.

45:28.718 --> 45:29.720
Be Ready, right?

45:30.220 --> 45:37.428
Now, you look at this thing here, and you say, this is 21, and you say, Budweiser, Be Ready.

45:38.149 --> 45:39.590
You know, and I don't know.

45:39.610 --> 45:43.875
I have to check that out because I don't know the distributor that,

45:44.243 --> 45:45.764
was like that, you know?

45:46.265 --> 45:49.287
Well, this is now pre-Prohibition, of course, right?

45:49.307 --> 45:49.508
Yes.

45:50.909 --> 45:58.515
And so I have to check this out, and one of these days I'll get down and just check this out, you see?

45:58.535 --> 46:00.557
This is called the Cleveland Topic, I guess.

46:01.878 --> 46:02.759
Cleveland Topics.

46:03.340 --> 46:03.800
Right.

46:03.940 --> 46:12.207
And, you know, it's a collection that I'm comfortable with.

46:12.247 --> 46:12.968
It's not like

46:13.100 --> 46:17.044
he yawns over there where he's honed in very tightly.

46:18.125 --> 46:18.746
You know what I mean?

46:18.986 --> 46:21.008
I don't, I'm not that honed in.

46:22.109 --> 46:27.355
So it satisfies you in a way that you feel that you've documented, I guess.

46:28.116 --> 46:28.416
Right.

46:28.436 --> 46:32.000
It's where I can show you out of many different things.

46:32.020 --> 46:39.748
As I was telling his good wife, when

46:43.829 --> 46:48.654
Well, don't worry about it.

46:48.854 --> 46:50.896
No, I'm trying to think of Gutenberg.

46:51.757 --> 46:56.542
They said he just, you know, he's movable press and type.

46:56.562 --> 46:57.503
Movable type, yeah.

46:58.103 --> 47:05.370
Well, the key to it was that previous to that they made type out of brass, out of copper, out of steel.

47:05.591 --> 47:07.052
They had wood blocks, of course.

47:07.072 --> 47:07.452
Everything.

47:07.513 --> 47:11.997
But, you know, when you take the letter P as an example, and you use that a lot,

47:12.280 --> 47:14.644
the center of the P fills in.

47:15.946 --> 47:34.236
And if you use certain words like the vowels, A, E, I, O, U, they will be used much more than W, X, Y, Z. So as you're printing, the mostly used letters are going to start to lose their height, whereas the lesser used ones have got a different height.

47:34.256 --> 47:38.743
So when you print, you will have a difference in the

47:39.095 --> 47:42.799
The print that's on the page, one will be light and one will be heavy.

47:43.821 --> 47:56.916
Now, Gutenberg designed a metal, came up with a composition of metal, so that when he cast this type in a mold, like if you were making lead soldiers, you made lead soldiers.

47:56.936 --> 47:58.137
I don't, but I don't.

47:58.157 --> 47:59.138
As a kid, maybe you did.

47:59.539 --> 48:00.840
Well, I did, yeah.

48:00.860 --> 48:01.401
Okay.

48:01.421 --> 48:02.803
He poured them.

48:03.263 --> 48:05.346
All the letters were the same height.

48:05.746 --> 48:07.448
The metal didn't shrink.

48:08.204 --> 48:16.655
So now when we'll say the vials got worn, he could throw all the lead back into a pot, melt it up, and cast all the letters.

48:16.695 --> 48:18.557
The essence of the linotype machine, really.

48:19.058 --> 48:19.799
I'll get into that.

48:20.420 --> 48:29.612
So I took, from the book finding company, I read composition for the linotypes and the Ludlow's and had them analyzed.

48:29.872 --> 48:36.561
And they still had a piece of type from Gutenberg they maintained.

48:36.581 --> 48:37.502
They'd analyzed it.

48:37.887 --> 48:45.018
And it's so close together, what they're using on the linotype, that only you have a little more flow to it.

48:45.098 --> 48:50.266
So it flowed a little easier, and then you had the cleansing agent, so you got the dross to the top.

48:50.286 --> 48:55.454
But it doesn't deviate very much in 500 years.

48:56.575 --> 48:58.378
Okay, now you take the linotype.

48:58.679 --> 49:01.343
Mark Twain, remember you put a fortune into it?

49:02.024 --> 49:03.786
Do you know what the key to the linotype is?

49:05.930 --> 49:06.190
Okay.

49:08.752 --> 49:10.435
He took a bath on it, didn't he, Mark?

49:10.455 --> 49:11.196
He took a bath.

49:11.296 --> 49:20.590
He took a big bath.

49:20.610 --> 49:21.952
Gee, there's a type here.

49:24.275 --> 49:25.537
So you collect type, too?

49:26.078 --> 49:29.143
No, I brought this home from the book finder.

49:29.223 --> 49:30.284
I love these shelves.

49:30.845 --> 49:32.127
They're indestructible.

49:41.320 --> 49:43.644
Well, let me see.

49:51.756 --> 49:53.178
Yeah, let me take a picture.

49:54.300 --> 50:05.538
And if you take the linotype, the mat is... Mm-hmm.

50:06.419 --> 50:06.820
And it comes over.

50:09.564 --> 50:09.724
Okay.

50:12.438 --> 50:16.424
Okay, the surface over is basically on here.

50:17.225 --> 50:30.664
Now, what Mergenthaler came up with is the V. By changing the notches, cutting one out here and maybe cutting this one out of there, he came up with a combination, 90 combinations.

50:32.126 --> 50:39.036
And so when it took the type and went up to the top and went on this master bar, when it hit the right combination, it fell down the chute.

50:40.197 --> 50:41.900
That was the key to the whole thing.

50:41.920 --> 50:45.345
Now, they also, they put a... Right.

50:46.086 --> 50:50.893
That's what Mergenthaler came up with, is this combination in here.

50:51.755 --> 50:55.000
They also now have a little indent in here.

50:55.060 --> 50:58.485
So now you can work two adjoining magazines.

50:58.565 --> 51:02.291
If the finger picks it up in here, it goes to this magazine, first one.

51:02.751 --> 51:04.995
If it doesn't pick it up, it goes to the top.

51:06.096 --> 51:08.500
See, so now you can work two adjoining magazines.

51:09.458 --> 51:10.379
With the line of type.

51:10.600 --> 51:12.022
Or inner type.

51:12.042 --> 51:13.144
They're basically the same.

51:14.886 --> 51:17.490
But this is the key that Mergenzahler came up with.

51:17.510 --> 51:18.131
Right there.

51:18.452 --> 51:19.193
That's the key.

51:19.774 --> 51:20.314
Nothing else.

51:20.695 --> 51:21.657
That's the key.

51:21.877 --> 51:22.558
That's amazing.

51:23.299 --> 51:23.700
Right.

51:23.720 --> 51:24.361
That's amazing.

51:24.441 --> 51:31.351
When you get down to those little factors or whatever you want to call them.

51:31.371 --> 51:32.513
I just read the dodo ring.

51:33.218 --> 51:34.861
Is that possible?

51:35.241 --> 51:36.403
No, that's the alarm.

51:36.423 --> 51:36.944
Oh, I see.

51:37.024 --> 51:40.008
One of the alarms that my wife is on her way, I think.

51:40.709 --> 51:41.310
Okay.

51:42.152 --> 51:42.953
I did hear a complete ring.

51:45.357 --> 51:53.349
You can see that there are, you know, when you go back, all the way back, the lead was the key, the composition of it.

51:54.050 --> 51:54.791
The ingredient.

51:54.811 --> 51:56.434
That excites you, doesn't it?

51:56.734 --> 51:56.834
Yeah.

51:56.854 --> 51:58.116
It's so simple yet.

51:58.557 --> 51:58.737
Oh.

51:59.206 --> 52:01.069
But, I mean, they haven't changed it in 500 years.

52:01.369 --> 52:02.171
Same damn stuff.

52:02.191 --> 52:02.852
It's the same thing.

52:02.872 --> 52:17.154
When you think of all the money they poured into this design, and here this guy comes up with this V. This little V. V. And as you, to me, I like to try different things, as you can see.

52:17.455 --> 52:22.703
Always trying something else to see if it'll work, if it won't work.

52:22.863 --> 52:24.466
Try it, right?

52:24.486 --> 52:25.888
Because if you don't try, nothing happens.

52:26.138 --> 52:27.219
That's right.

52:27.299 --> 52:29.501
That's the whole essence of invention, isn't it?

52:29.521 --> 52:30.122
You've got to try.

52:30.162 --> 52:32.063
And some people like to do it.

52:32.784 --> 52:34.946
Some people don't.

52:34.966 --> 52:35.686
I like to try.

52:35.767 --> 52:38.109
Everything I try is different.

52:38.889 --> 52:41.552
You know, this house fireproof wood, now we know what's wrong.

52:42.012 --> 52:42.573
That's okay.

52:42.593 --> 52:44.074
I can get stainless steel nails.

52:44.194 --> 52:46.056
We'll put them all back in again.

52:46.796 --> 52:52.401
But the drywall is all fireproof, right in here.

52:52.962 --> 52:55.504
All across here, all this board being solid.

52:56.733 --> 53:01.880
Very slow burn, because we're on a volunteer fire department.

53:01.900 --> 53:02.561
It takes time.

53:02.942 --> 53:03.582
It takes time.

53:03.663 --> 53:06.807
These guys, you know, they're trying to figure out what the hell to do.

53:06.907 --> 53:11.173
And you certainly don't want a sprinkler system that's going to destroy all these books.

53:11.353 --> 53:13.376
No, sprinkler systems are no good.

53:14.878 --> 53:20.466
Sprinkler systems basically do more damage than what they say.

53:20.526 --> 53:22.268
If you've ever been in a place that's had

53:22.552 --> 53:26.117
And I've been in a place already that the sprinkler system's gone a lot.

53:26.318 --> 53:27.059
Disaster.

53:27.299 --> 53:28.681
You know what I mean?

53:28.781 --> 53:30.323
It becomes a total disaster.

53:30.363 --> 53:33.648
Your insurance company thinks they saved everything.

53:33.869 --> 53:35.912
Makes it harder to get your money back, probably.

53:35.992 --> 53:36.733
Yeah.

53:36.833 --> 53:40.719
I mean, I'd rather have the damn thing burned to the high, burned to the ground.

53:40.739 --> 53:42.962
We have power walls in here and everything else.

53:43.683 --> 53:46.467
It's beautifully protected then.

53:46.936 --> 53:51.282
Can we just take a look at some of these?

53:51.322 --> 53:52.824
What are these?

53:53.004 --> 53:53.605
Debris?

53:53.725 --> 53:54.045
Debris.

53:56.689 --> 54:01.615
I mean, these are 1500s to 1600s.

54:03.337 --> 54:07.522
What makes this so interesting?

54:07.542 --> 54:10.386
Look at how beautiful they are.

54:10.406 --> 54:11.768
Look at the pictures.

54:13.350 --> 54:14.592
These are magnificent.

54:14.612 --> 54:14.952
Oh, look at that.

54:16.720 --> 54:23.751
And these are so early, right?

54:23.792 --> 54:26.195
These are all early voyages.

54:28.059 --> 54:29.641
Hello.

54:30.122 --> 54:33.868
If you weren't on the porch, you'd have to be up here.

54:35.553 --> 54:36.374
How are you?

54:36.394 --> 54:36.714
I'm Nick.

54:36.734 --> 54:36.995
Nick.

54:37.015 --> 54:37.355
Nick.

54:37.535 --> 54:38.216
Nice to meet you.

54:38.236 --> 54:38.797
Pleasure to meet you.

54:38.857 --> 54:41.500
I saw a strange bag on my kitchen.

54:41.520 --> 54:43.202
I forgot my initials on it.

54:44.663 --> 54:45.484
I'm sorry.

54:45.785 --> 54:46.245
That's me.

54:46.265 --> 54:46.365
Yeah.

54:46.425 --> 54:47.787
Anyway, that's me.

54:48.167 --> 54:49.109
I'm sorry.

54:49.129 --> 54:50.410
I just wanted to get that bag.

54:50.831 --> 54:51.271
No, no, no.

54:51.691 --> 54:52.532
There's someone here.

54:52.933 --> 54:53.914
Just one quick question.

54:54.375 --> 54:55.596
Did you see Charlie?

54:56.557 --> 54:58.499
You know, he didn't do the inside of the garage doors.

54:59.320 --> 55:00.642
And I didn't think to tell him that.

55:00.802 --> 55:01.763
And they needed to.

55:02.333 --> 55:03.455
of the beast down here.

55:03.856 --> 55:04.497
Should I call him?

55:04.737 --> 55:07.562
You can talk to him and see what he wants to do.

55:07.642 --> 55:11.769
He's coming back?

55:11.830 --> 55:12.891
I don't know if he is.

55:12.911 --> 55:13.813
He said he was done.

55:13.833 --> 55:17.840
Asked me if we have to add the insides to him.

55:17.860 --> 55:19.463
That's beautiful.

55:19.483 --> 55:21.847
The pictures are what makes this look.

55:21.927 --> 55:25.894
I can't read anything, but you look at the pictures.

55:31.055 --> 55:33.218
And you probably have the whole life.

55:33.298 --> 55:39.004
Well, tell me, explain a little bit about debris to me.

55:39.064 --> 55:40.226
What exactly was it?

55:41.487 --> 55:42.809
It's voyages.

55:43.249 --> 55:44.491
And I really don't know.

55:44.511 --> 55:47.074
I've never done my research on it.

55:47.114 --> 55:48.736
We're talking 1594.

55:49.296 --> 55:54.543
This is pretty... It's crazy because they have America and you have India.

55:54.943 --> 55:56.445
You have a Latin edition.

55:56.465 --> 55:58.227
You have a German edition.

55:58.831 --> 56:01.696
So you brought them for the illustrations, really?

56:01.776 --> 56:02.016
Yeah, right.

56:02.517 --> 56:03.779
I see.

56:03.799 --> 56:06.143
You see, but here's one by Stedman.

56:06.844 --> 56:09.348
Oh, that's very well known, yeah.

56:09.368 --> 56:11.271
Can you see what this has?

56:11.512 --> 56:13.495
Sir H. Clinton, whoever that is.

56:13.836 --> 56:17.722
With marginal notes by Sir Clinton.

56:18.243 --> 56:22.650
He was the British general.

56:22.670 --> 56:22.971
Really?

56:23.492 --> 56:23.792
Yes.

56:23.992 --> 56:26.635
And this, we're talking about the American Law of Independence, right?

56:26.655 --> 56:26.916
Right.

56:27.056 --> 56:28.317
And he's got his own history.

56:28.558 --> 56:28.778
Right.

56:28.798 --> 56:31.942
So he's got his own notes in here.

56:31.962 --> 56:32.383
Wow.

56:33.604 --> 56:34.846
That's London, 1794.

56:35.006 --> 56:38.330
And that is his, the copy of the general.

56:39.892 --> 56:41.795
It's his own.

56:41.875 --> 56:43.417
So where did you find this?

56:43.677 --> 56:44.478
At Fleming's.

56:45.499 --> 56:47.882
Good for Fleming, huh?

56:48.243 --> 56:48.463
Yeah.

56:51.025 --> 56:53.109
So what is the focus over here?

56:53.129 --> 56:53.990
Exploration?

56:54.070 --> 56:55.333
Exploration, basically.

56:56.575 --> 56:57.917
Exploration, you know.

56:57.937 --> 56:58.779
This is Western.

56:58.799 --> 57:00.662
You've got Hacklett's Voyages, I see.

57:02.566 --> 57:03.267
Is that the first?

57:04.589 --> 57:06.452
That's a tough.

57:06.472 --> 57:07.134
That's a tough get.

57:07.194 --> 57:08.196
It's through three volumes.

57:08.376 --> 57:11.682
And that looks like a very early binding, too, doesn't it?

57:14.306 --> 57:14.687
Wonderful.

57:15.005 --> 57:17.690
And then I have books on pirates, you know, and things like that.

57:17.710 --> 57:18.773
You've got to have books on pirates.

57:18.813 --> 57:19.995
I love pirates, yeah.

57:20.015 --> 57:22.340
I love maps to anything on cartography, yeah.

57:23.001 --> 57:27.831
The one you've got to get that's the key to the whole thing is Buccaneers of America.

57:29.153 --> 57:32.961
And that's the one that, you know, most of them, they pull the maps out of it.

57:32.981 --> 57:34.063
And that has the maps in it?

57:34.083 --> 57:34.284
Oh, yeah.

57:34.304 --> 57:35.085
Can you show me one?

57:35.346 --> 57:35.967
I have so, yeah.

57:39.507 --> 57:41.409
Now, how come you have an Uncle Tom's Cabin?

57:41.429 --> 57:43.552
How does that fit in to the collection?

57:43.572 --> 57:47.696
Because it was available, right?

57:48.678 --> 57:48.838
Yeah.

57:48.858 --> 57:52.462
You know, and we have the other one.

57:52.502 --> 57:55.546
We have this Mark Twain, a Yankee and King Arthur's Court.

57:55.626 --> 57:57.448
You have the Huckleberry Finn.

57:58.549 --> 58:01.753
Looking Backward, which is quite an important book, Bellamy's book.

58:01.873 --> 58:03.855
This one, Uncle Tom's Cabin.

58:03.875 --> 58:06.358
Yeah, I have Uncle Tom's Cabin over there.

58:07.081 --> 58:22.579
This is called Buccaneers of America.

58:23.340 --> 58:26.183
That's Morgan.

58:26.283 --> 58:27.384
He was Bluebeard, right?

58:28.385 --> 58:34.152
Are a true account of the most remarkable assaults committed in late years upon the coasts of the West Indies.

58:34.672 --> 58:41.723
by the Buccaneers of Jamaica and Tortuga, both English and French, 1684, London.

58:42.043 --> 58:42.504
Why?

58:42.864 --> 58:44.066
There's a map.

58:44.086 --> 58:45.588
No, that's in front of space.

58:45.608 --> 58:52.258
This is the description here.

58:52.299 --> 58:54.562
Most famous work of the American Pirates.

58:55.503 --> 58:56.204
Who's the author?

58:56.224 --> 59:01.352
S... Yeah, Esquimillion.

59:01.372 --> 59:02.013
Yes.

59:02.975 --> 59:03.936
Q-U-E-M.

59:04.253 --> 59:05.755
E-L-I-N.

59:05.775 --> 59:06.475
Okay.

59:07.496 --> 59:13.843
This is the Don Seitz.

59:13.863 --> 59:15.065
Well, that's the whole copy.

59:16.426 --> 59:16.967
So, you know what?

59:17.007 --> 59:19.129
I can find this in the whole panel, which I have.

59:20.951 --> 59:23.694
You see, back in those days, you could find things like this.

59:25.296 --> 59:26.317
No, you can't now.

59:26.557 --> 59:27.398
Those days are gone.

59:29.120 --> 59:30.661
That's suffering.

59:30.681 --> 59:32.303
It just fits up on top of here.

59:33.987 --> 59:54.390
And you probably, what you don't, what you probably missed is if you really want to see someone in theirs, all of the Webster's Dictionary from the first volume to the two volumes and all the later things, all by Webster.

59:55.251 --> 59:55.952
Noah.

59:55.972 --> 59:56.272
Yes.

59:57.493 --> 01:00:00.136
All of his, and how many different ones are there offhand, do you think?

01:00:00.497 --> 01:00:03.420
Oh, is that a first Peeps diary up there?

01:00:04.126 --> 01:00:06.109
How about it looks old?

01:00:06.129 --> 01:00:09.193
I picked up a fourth down in Cape Cod.

01:00:09.333 --> 01:00:11.255
There's something about pizza.

01:00:11.275 --> 01:00:16.522
I have a letter and so forth in one of the lives.

01:00:17.884 --> 01:00:19.386
How about the wife of Johnson?

01:00:19.446 --> 01:00:21.068
Is that a first?

01:00:22.530 --> 01:00:24.012
You've got some stuff here, my friend.

01:00:24.032 --> 01:00:28.378
This one is something like that.

01:00:30.012 --> 01:00:32.695
Some of the bindings here are quite wonderful, I have to say.

01:00:32.775 --> 01:00:34.076
We haven't even talked about that.

01:00:35.118 --> 01:00:37.220
He uses memoirs over there.

01:00:38.521 --> 01:00:40.063
Boswell's Life of Johnson.

01:00:40.083 --> 01:00:41.965
Oh, I love Chesterfield's letters.

01:00:43.567 --> 01:00:46.270
Is that the first Chesterfield's letters?

01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:47.131
It should be.

01:00:47.531 --> 01:00:47.711
Yeah.

01:00:48.392 --> 01:00:50.014
The bindings, though.

01:00:50.034 --> 01:00:52.797
I got the first Irish, which is pretty darn close.
