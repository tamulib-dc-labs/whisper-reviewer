WEBVTT

00:05.060 --> 00:09.999
I never stopped to count what I was doing.

00:10.300 --> 00:12.850
I just worked on it with a passion.

00:12.870 --> 00:16.082
The idea was not to see how much I could collect.

00:17.227 --> 00:18.388
Yes, oh, come on now.

00:18.568 --> 00:19.289
No, it wasn't.

00:19.309 --> 00:20.951
You still wanted a premier collection.

00:21.071 --> 00:26.636
Yes, but it wasn't to see how much quantitative... Oh, no, no, you certainly weren't moved by linear feet.

00:26.716 --> 00:27.837
No, I wasn't.

00:28.158 --> 00:30.780
I was moved by trying to do more in a scholarly way.

00:30.800 --> 00:33.583
I mean, this is a question of significance, if we can create a work.

00:33.603 --> 00:35.105
Yeah, right, it was a question of that.

00:35.125 --> 00:36.506
People talk about trivia.

00:36.606 --> 00:37.867
I say, how about significance?

00:37.887 --> 00:39.409
Let me tell you what else happened.

00:39.429 --> 00:43.673
The more effective I was at acquiring these materials, at finding the people,

00:44.463 --> 00:53.411
the easier it got with the next person to impress upon that person or that family or the children of those people that what L.D.

00:53.451 --> 00:57.034
Brodsky was up to was significant in its own right.

00:57.495 --> 01:12.748
And that if I could acquire your mother's materials, or if I could acquire your materials, sir, I can put them in a repository where they will not get eaten by the dog or silverfish, where they will not get scattered and gone, and furthermore,

01:12.914 --> 01:22.787
And though I never, I put this always more eloquently, the essence was I can memorialize the role you played in the life of Faulkner through your artifacts.

01:23.308 --> 01:24.389
I will put them in books.

01:24.810 --> 01:26.372
I will explode them, as it were.

01:26.392 --> 01:27.733
I will disclose them.

01:27.753 --> 01:30.878
Then I will describe them with my collaborator, Bob.

01:31.578 --> 01:33.641
We will make them important in their own right.

01:33.781 --> 01:35.043
We will give them a context.

01:35.864 --> 01:38.327
And I used to persuade people with that kind of a thing.

01:39.048 --> 01:40.390
And most people that I dealt with

01:40.673 --> 01:49.685
because they were Faulkner's friends, were necessarily literate, very intelligent, very topical in terms of their knowledge of what's going on.

01:50.285 --> 01:51.607
Right people, that was something.

01:51.847 --> 01:52.809
That was a treat, too.

01:52.869 --> 01:58.015
And I told you that I met people all the time and that that was what my book collecting consisted of, was people collecting.

01:58.116 --> 01:59.197
It was collecting Faulkner.

01:59.738 --> 02:09.330
It was a pleasure to be in the company of almost all the people I ever met because they were so much more than normal in their intellects, which makes sense.

02:10.137 --> 02:22.131
because Faulkner only really consorted with two kinds of people, and consort is the wrong word, but he was associated with really only two kinds of people.

02:22.472 --> 02:22.992
And they are?

02:23.293 --> 02:30.502
They are either the really intelligent, literate, artistic, cultured person, or the hunting buddy type.

02:31.363 --> 02:33.525
There was really no in-between for Faulkner.

02:34.166 --> 02:35.908
He wouldn't conch in ignorance.

02:36.631 --> 02:41.659
The only time he ever put up with ignorance was when it was with his drinking buddies on a hunt.

02:41.679 --> 02:43.422
And he knew how to deal with that.

02:44.183 --> 02:46.527
And he could do real well with writing that.

02:46.848 --> 02:53.879
He could deal with illiterates as long as they were people like Ryder and Pantaloon and Nancy and Dilsey.

02:54.701 --> 02:58.227
He could deal with that kind of ignorance and he had great respect and compassion.

02:58.307 --> 03:00.871
Well, it was ignorance and it was illiteracy.

03:00.951 --> 03:03.115
Every person we can't read is not ignorant.

03:03.135 --> 03:03.415
Right.

03:03.580 --> 03:05.082
What he had no patience with.

03:05.102 --> 03:07.906
Some of the biggest asphalt in the world in Harvard degrees.

03:08.587 --> 03:10.470
Well, that's exactly why L.D.

03:10.510 --> 03:15.998
did not go on at Washington U. And I'm not going to say that categorically, that's what he deployed.

03:16.619 --> 03:21.587
It seems to abound in the very places where the most intelligence and literacy should be.

03:22.268 --> 03:23.730
You seem to get the most arrogance.

03:23.770 --> 03:25.653
Robert Coles, a great Robert Coles.

03:25.713 --> 03:27.075
It's not enough to be on tape.

03:27.876 --> 03:28.717
We're back on again.

03:28.737 --> 03:30.380
Okay, I'm just going to show you a few more things.

03:30.660 --> 03:32.743
Early fragments from Phil Stone's archive.

03:33.432 --> 03:35.334
And these were saved.

03:36.456 --> 03:38.578
These were the earliest stuff from 1918, 1919, 1920.

03:38.598 --> 03:43.724
In 1942, there was a fire in Phil Stone's home.

03:44.225 --> 03:48.130
Hold it up a little bit, so I can get you on the document.

03:48.630 --> 03:49.772
Oh, you know what?

03:50.092 --> 04:02.487
Yeah, we'll see if I can... Hold on, you can try to focus, but it's having a hard time.

04:02.867 --> 04:03.128
There it is.

04:03.148 --> 04:03.388
There it is.

04:05.714 --> 04:06.535
There was a fire.

04:07.175 --> 04:08.857
These were preserved.

04:09.978 --> 04:11.900
These were dug up out of croaker sacks.

04:12.781 --> 04:15.223
Or a lot of them were just stacks that had been underground.

04:16.484 --> 04:19.347
And they hadn't, had they been underground or they were on the porch.

04:19.367 --> 04:20.028
I know what it was.

04:20.128 --> 04:21.089
The porch collapsed.

04:21.749 --> 04:22.430
The closet.

04:22.730 --> 04:23.991
The roof collapsed.

04:24.031 --> 04:25.293
The closet collapsed.

04:25.313 --> 04:27.935
And the roof collapsed on top of all the stuff that fell down under it.

04:28.155 --> 04:29.236
I don't think it was outdoors.

04:29.336 --> 04:31.118
They said they took it outdoors to dry it out.

04:31.599 --> 04:33.861
It had been under there for a long time.

04:33.921 --> 04:34.101
Years.

04:35.195 --> 04:40.161
For 10 years, when Carvel went, Carvel brought it out of the old burned wreckage.

04:40.221 --> 04:40.722
He and Emily.

04:40.982 --> 04:41.443
And Emily.

04:41.964 --> 04:48.011
The reason a lot of these didn't burn completely was Phil had tied up stacks of Faulkner's early manuscripts.

04:48.952 --> 04:52.317
These are the earliest known manuscripts.

04:52.577 --> 04:54.159
And we have quite a number of these fragments.

04:54.199 --> 04:56.142
We call them the stone fragments.

04:57.543 --> 04:58.945
These are absolutely sensational.

04:59.025 --> 05:00.247
This is his early handwriting.

05:00.267 --> 05:01.308
You can see how different it was.

05:01.388 --> 05:02.189
It's very effeminate.

05:02.249 --> 05:03.531
It's very florid.

05:03.781 --> 05:05.543
You know what they are of?

05:06.064 --> 05:08.067
Yeah, we've worked on all of them.

05:08.127 --> 05:14.355
A lot of them are from a book he never published at the time called Vision in Spring.

05:14.916 --> 05:17.059
No, that's recently published by Texas.

05:17.079 --> 05:17.680
Yes.

05:18.220 --> 05:19.983
Some of these are manuscripts from that.

05:20.584 --> 05:24.128
Yes, we've identified most of them, and we've got them in a new book, Volume 5.

05:24.709 --> 05:26.291
In the early, in the 50s.

05:26.471 --> 05:28.354
There's a piece of his marble font.

05:28.672 --> 05:34.262
Texas acquired 80 pieces of these burned fragments from stone.

05:34.502 --> 05:37.328
When I was down there in February, they were working on them.

05:37.688 --> 05:38.009
Right.

05:38.029 --> 05:39.972
They were doing so many a year, each year.

05:40.032 --> 05:43.839
And for some reason, they overlooked these or a stone hill.

05:45.001 --> 05:45.362
Can't you?

05:45.783 --> 05:48.688
You see that smell never goes away, does it?

05:49.411 --> 05:52.875
I presume Stone just held some back.

05:52.915 --> 05:54.637
He didn't let Texas have all of them.

05:54.657 --> 05:54.817
He did.

05:54.837 --> 05:55.678
He wanted to keep these.

05:55.698 --> 05:57.420
He was very fond of these.

05:57.740 --> 05:59.522
He didn't get lost.

05:59.542 --> 06:00.744
It was his student.

06:00.764 --> 06:02.065
He was very prized.

06:02.325 --> 06:05.249
One thing we haven't touched on is the way L.D.

06:05.509 --> 06:14.659
going public, that is with exhibits and publishing materials, has also augmented his collection, his opportunities to collect.

06:15.382 --> 06:20.209
Usually after an exhibit, somebody contacts him.

06:20.229 --> 06:22.091
One time the lady read in the St.

06:22.111 --> 06:24.415
Louis paper, she thought it was my collection.

06:24.435 --> 06:29.021
So she wrote me the letter, and she had this oil painting done by Faulkner's mother.

06:29.462 --> 06:31.144
And so I sent LD the letter.

06:31.164 --> 06:37.132
I wrote her and said, well, if you've mistaken me, Mr. Brodsky is the collector, and I'll send the letter on to him.

06:37.172 --> 06:39.195
And two weeks later, I was at Farmington.

06:39.698 --> 06:40.259
And L.D.

06:40.319 --> 06:43.081
already had the oil painting hanging on the wall.

06:43.902 --> 06:45.644
I'd have been over to acquire it, you know.

06:45.664 --> 06:56.314
I spoke in Montgomery, Alabama a couple of years ago, and there was a lady who came up and said she'd heard me talking about these fragments and all.

06:56.334 --> 07:01.299
She says, I have a burned fragment, a piece that Emily Stone had given me.

07:01.700 --> 07:05.143
I'd forgotten when I went to Montgomery that that's where Emily was living for a while.

07:06.224 --> 07:07.005
And so...

07:07.964 --> 07:14.233
The work that we've done... The publishing that L.D.

07:14.273 --> 07:19.260
has done and so on, the exhibits have created additional opportunities to collect.

07:24.487 --> 07:25.448
This is the kind of stuff.

07:25.509 --> 07:26.630
It goes on and on and on.

07:27.091 --> 07:27.912
It blows my mind.

07:28.473 --> 07:33.179
I started out as one kind of a collector, and I never would have dreamed that we would ever put together materials like this.

07:34.241 --> 07:37.245
Nick, I can't tell you what a...

07:37.360 --> 07:41.304
just the scintillating feeling it is to know that I was able to bring all this together.

07:43.126 --> 07:45.108
There is no sense of pride in ownership.

07:45.849 --> 07:46.590
I never got that.

07:46.610 --> 07:47.451
It was very strange.

07:47.531 --> 07:54.078
The more I would accumulate, paradoxically, the less sense of pride in ownership I felt.

07:54.638 --> 08:01.586
Because the greater the collection grew, the more I knew that I didn't deserve it any longer.

08:02.286 --> 08:03.968
Because Faulkner belongs to all of us.

08:04.008 --> 08:04.849
His literature does.

08:05.190 --> 08:06.591
And I felt equally so.

08:07.178 --> 08:08.419
that his artifacts did.

08:09.200 --> 08:11.102
And I really did grow into that feeling.

08:11.142 --> 08:13.124
And I grew into that feeling maybe 15 years ago.

08:13.504 --> 08:22.833
It was that strong sense that the materials belonged to all of us that allowed me to go ahead and try to acquire as much of it as I could.

08:23.334 --> 08:28.098
I had a great deal of versatility, a manipulative quality to me.

08:28.398 --> 08:30.340
I understood people's psychologies.

08:30.681 --> 08:32.262
I understood how to get to most people.

08:33.023 --> 08:35.245
I never felt I ever deceived anyone

08:35.731 --> 08:37.634
I tried to pay what I had available.

08:38.275 --> 08:39.818
I wasn't exactly real wealthy.

08:39.878 --> 08:43.483
I told you this whole collection got put together for a certain sum.

08:44.104 --> 08:45.166
It was really modest.

08:45.847 --> 08:51.656
When I told you that I bought the one archive of Warner Brothers scripts for the equivalent of $8,000, that's the truth.

08:51.937 --> 08:54.741
But that's a credit to my own acumen, if you will.

08:55.502 --> 08:57.205
And I'm not bending my arm when I say that.

08:57.265 --> 08:58.387
It is a credit.

08:58.928 --> 08:59.369
Well, it is.

08:59.449 --> 09:01.512
But it's also I was versatile.

09:02.153 --> 09:03.375
And I was savvy enough.

09:04.604 --> 09:08.108
to do these things, but I never, ever once felt I deceived anyone.

09:08.568 --> 09:14.035
And I would size up a situation and try to figure out, now, what is it going to take to acquire these?

09:14.515 --> 09:16.017
I told you the story of Vance Broach.

09:16.037 --> 09:21.463
It just required quantitative duplicates, a lot of them, and one cherished book, The Marble Fawn.

09:22.164 --> 09:25.468
With someone else, it required something else.

09:25.488 --> 09:27.490
How am I going to get the Phil Stone collection?

09:27.590 --> 09:32.856
Well, I'm going to sell off a bunch of slot machines and a bunch of horn phonographs, and then I'm going to borrow half the money

09:33.983 --> 09:35.005
And that's what I'm going to do.

09:35.065 --> 09:40.473
Each thing presented a different, each acquisition presented a different challenge.

09:42.275 --> 09:45.700
And I almost never failed.

09:46.501 --> 09:47.463
I failed twice.

09:48.985 --> 09:50.347
And that was real disappointing.

09:51.188 --> 09:59.661
Well, one time was interestingly enough with Chooky Faulkner, Jimmy's brother, William's other nephew.

10:00.782 --> 10:01.864
How do you spell Chooky?

10:01.945 --> 10:04.848
Chooky, C-H-O-O-K-Y, isn't it?

10:06.350 --> 10:07.872
C-H-O-O-K-Y, yeah.

10:08.973 --> 10:09.354
Murray.

10:12.177 --> 10:16.983
And I'm not going to get into that story except to say that he had some wonderful letters and inscribed books.

10:17.283 --> 10:18.544
They ended up going to Virginia.

10:20.006 --> 10:20.827
I should have had them.

10:20.907 --> 10:26.634
I worked at it for a long time and didn't end up acquiring them, and it wasn't because I didn't... I don't want to get into that story.

10:26.694 --> 10:27.775
They paid?

10:27.795 --> 10:28.516
I paid more.

10:28.716 --> 10:29.377
I offered more.

10:30.198 --> 10:31.159
Point is, I guess,

10:31.426 --> 10:32.427
You can't win them all.

10:33.569 --> 10:34.851
I was very fortunate.

10:35.071 --> 10:35.672
Who had them?

10:37.435 --> 10:41.741
Murray had them, Jerry Jr., Chucky, had them, and they ended up going to Virginia.

10:41.801 --> 10:45.407
And there was one other acquisition that I missed, too, and I've forgotten why now.

10:46.348 --> 10:53.779
I guess it is to say, finally, that you work at it, and you don't win them all.

10:54.380 --> 10:56.363
But I won more than my share of them.

10:56.383 --> 10:57.745
And you don't look back either when you win.

10:57.805 --> 10:58.727
No, you don't look back.

10:58.947 --> 11:00.910
And I'll tell you another trick about collecting, too.

11:01.835 --> 11:13.252
You size up what's there, and you decide, I'm either going to go for it because I'm going for the long haul, because I'm committed to collecting, because if this one's too expensive, the next one will be, I'll get it right.

11:14.013 --> 11:22.045
You have to develop a sense of balance, of equanimity, so that if you blow it on one, it'll wash out in the next.

11:22.385 --> 11:23.247
You can't lament.

11:24.068 --> 11:30.998
But you better get what's there and work at any way you need to do it to get it if you're going to succeed.

11:31.670 --> 11:32.811
You just have to.

11:32.831 --> 11:41.319
And one of the things I learned developing on was that you better not get staggered as the prices vary on you from year to year or month to month.

11:41.339 --> 11:42.540
You got to go with the flow.

11:43.181 --> 11:49.227
Because as Faulkner became more interesting to collect, the prices got more heady.

11:50.047 --> 11:51.449
And they continued to get headier.

11:52.390 --> 11:54.732
And it got harder to play the game.

11:55.713 --> 11:57.334
Now it's pretty tough to play the game.

11:59.076 --> 12:00.377
He says we blew his cover.

12:00.998 --> 12:04.261
Who said this?

12:04.281 --> 12:07.485
He had been to the Faulkner Conference how many years in a row?

12:07.565 --> 12:11.950
Five years or so in a row, and the people at Ole Miss had never figured out he was a collector.

12:12.470 --> 12:26.365
When I met him, he was not exactly a closet collector, but he certainly had not gone public, and that's why he was able to do some of the negotiations behind the scenes, and one of the concerns that he had

12:27.172 --> 12:35.420
early on about going public, that he's doing an exhibit, was that it would blow his cover.

12:35.480 --> 12:40.225
It would make it more difficult for him, in part, to do some of the things that he... On the one hand.

12:40.305 --> 12:43.568
But it opened up other doors.

12:43.648 --> 12:50.114
And it not only gave me more exposure and opened up doors, it created a credibility for me.

12:50.675 --> 12:51.135
And it did.

12:51.175 --> 12:52.977
And that was ultimately the salutary

12:53.227 --> 12:54.128
Aspect of it.

12:54.148 --> 13:00.095
Yeah, see what my piece appears in the I told you that piece of the New York Times Can I tell you that?

13:00.115 --> 13:01.136
I'm doing a piece for the Times.

13:01.156 --> 13:01.917
What we do.

13:01.937 --> 13:02.437
Oh, wonderful.

13:02.457 --> 13:03.218
You have to go ahead.

13:03.398 --> 13:05.440
What's it on?

13:05.981 --> 13:07.182
I mean, collecting.

13:07.202 --> 13:08.304
Oh, wonderful.

13:08.724 --> 13:10.366
Did I tell you that?

13:10.386 --> 13:10.626
No.

13:10.886 --> 13:11.767
I haven't written it yet.

13:11.948 --> 13:14.530
I'm submitting it in January.

13:14.671 --> 13:18.795
But I believe when that piece is published, I'm going to hear from

13:19.265 --> 13:22.552
I mean, the tank, I mean, we're full.

13:23.634 --> 13:24.496
But you never know.

13:24.596 --> 13:29.447
I mean, there might be something just exquisite that you ignore at your peril.

13:29.748 --> 13:35.921
But I'm sure that with a 1.8 million circulation book, you're one of those essays, you know?

13:35.941 --> 13:37.063
Yeah, that's wonderful.

13:37.083 --> 13:37.865
Yeah, I expect that.

13:38.887 --> 13:39.248
Yeah.

13:40.004 --> 13:42.868
Is that what Bob said?

13:42.968 --> 13:44.850
Yeah, we covered that.

13:45.051 --> 13:45.391
Okay, good.

13:46.052 --> 13:48.295
Well, we'll show him on the way out.

13:48.415 --> 13:51.559
Let me show you two more books and then we'll call it quits so we can take a drive home.

13:52.300 --> 13:54.143
I'm starting to poop out.

13:55.665 --> 13:57.407
I want to show you Flynn Snopes' copy.

13:58.909 --> 14:00.191
This is the Marble Con.

14:00.291 --> 14:02.594
Oh, I would not have wanted to go home.

14:03.154 --> 14:04.016
This one's lovely.

14:04.516 --> 14:05.498
This one's really lovely.

14:05.538 --> 14:08.121
This is a gorgeous jacketed copy.

14:08.388 --> 14:09.309
Oh, my God.

14:09.369 --> 14:10.230
It's really beautiful.

14:11.572 --> 14:15.197
It should be protected better than this, and it will be.

14:15.217 --> 14:26.451
But this is the copy that Faulkner inscribed to Joe Parks, who was the man that took over his grandfather's bank in Oxford, who they think was the prototype for Clem Stokes.

14:27.292 --> 14:35.222
So that was signed to Joe Parks, who actually ousted his grandfather from the bank.

14:36.012 --> 14:37.674
He signed twice, didn't he?

14:37.774 --> 14:38.515
I sure did.

14:38.555 --> 14:40.458
Look at that.

14:40.478 --> 14:43.622
William Parker, Oxford, Mississippi, 24... December.

14:43.802 --> 14:45.404
December, 1924.

14:46.205 --> 14:47.647
Just take the ginger ginger there.

14:47.667 --> 14:50.210
Just let me place it in my hands.

14:50.730 --> 14:52.232
Wow, that's beautiful.

14:52.252 --> 14:53.694
That's really exquisite.

14:53.714 --> 14:56.998
We're holding the marble faun, F-A-U-N.

14:58.340 --> 14:59.021
This is it.

14:59.061 --> 15:00.122
That's the first one.

15:00.202 --> 15:02.345
And that's one of the great inscribed copies.

15:03.086 --> 15:03.927
That's beautiful.

15:05.240 --> 15:16.499
I'm going to show him one more after this.

15:16.519 --> 15:18.122
I'm going to show you just two more books.

15:19.564 --> 15:21.207
This is a book I'm very fond of.

15:21.688 --> 15:23.391
This came out of Faulkner's library.

15:24.493 --> 15:26.215
Faulkner wanted to be a poet.

15:26.236 --> 15:28.900
That was his great dream, as I told you, to be a poet.

15:28.920 --> 15:31.264
He always regarded himself, as I said, a failed poet.

15:31.514 --> 15:34.377
He did the next best thing, he said.

15:34.417 --> 15:35.698
He wrote fiction.

15:36.599 --> 15:39.503
This was his book of the Oxford book of English first.

15:43.167 --> 15:45.990
It came out of his library.

15:46.010 --> 15:50.895
What are all these little... These were notations that some book dealer apparently put in.

15:51.115 --> 15:52.156
Oh, yeah.

15:52.176 --> 15:52.657
But it's okay.

15:54.038 --> 15:55.179
It's not bad.

15:55.199 --> 15:56.661
$2,500 I paid for it.

15:57.248 --> 15:58.229
I couldn't believe it.

15:58.490 --> 16:00.352
It ended up in Jenkins' book catalog.

16:00.392 --> 16:04.157
A man got it out of Oxford and surreptitiously sold it.

16:04.358 --> 16:05.619
I saw it in the book catalog.

16:05.680 --> 16:12.429
It had just come out, but the book, which, you know, by the time you get a book catalog, other people have seen the stock and bought this book.

16:12.449 --> 16:13.370
No one wanted it.

16:13.390 --> 16:15.373
No one had made a phone call for this book.

16:15.633 --> 16:20.019
This, to me, was one of the most significant books that you could have with Franklin.

16:20.199 --> 16:21.441
The Oxford Book of English Press.

16:21.461 --> 16:26.428
Yes, because he absolutely admired it, and it was the 1924 edition, the year of his marble form.

16:26.982 --> 16:30.145
I think it's one of the great Faulkner books in this collection.

16:30.865 --> 16:35.449
I want to show you one final book that is unequivocally the best.

16:35.469 --> 16:43.557
I will now show you the best if I can find it, and I can.

16:43.577 --> 16:50.663
This is truly a unique, one-of-a-kind Faulkner book.

16:51.443 --> 16:52.705
He typed each page.

16:53.525 --> 16:54.886
He bound it by hand.

16:55.687 --> 16:56.668
He stapled it.

16:57.492 --> 17:07.564
He inscribed it in typescript to his daughter-in-law, sorry, his stepdaughter-to-be, who was Cho Cho.

17:07.624 --> 17:10.767
He made this book, The Wishing Tree.

17:11.608 --> 17:12.750
And that's the little book.

17:13.451 --> 17:14.151
Go ahead.

17:14.171 --> 17:17.295
That one just don't crack it, of course.

17:17.415 --> 17:20.659
This is The Wishing Tree, Wishing Dash Trees.

17:21.480 --> 17:21.980
Can I open it?

17:22.040 --> 17:22.521
Yes, sure.

17:24.577 --> 17:28.303
Now you can take us.

17:28.744 --> 17:30.587
This is one of the great books.

17:30.607 --> 17:33.211
You should consider yourself very privileged.

17:34.293 --> 17:38.740
In part, that's true because you're so knowledgeable about books and all.

17:39.781 --> 17:44.509
The wishing tree for his dear friend Viscoria on her eighth birthday.

17:44.658 --> 17:46.180
Bill, he made this book.

17:46.200 --> 17:47.781
Hold that open, L.D.

17:47.881 --> 17:54.948
A lot of the people, what I'm saying, a lot of the people that interview L.D., he's a little more reluctant to let them handle the material.

17:54.968 --> 17:56.290
Well, I appreciate that.

17:56.390 --> 17:58.532
But he knows that he wants to handle them.

17:58.672 --> 17:59.473
I agree.

17:59.573 --> 18:04.057
Well, and he knows how to handle them, and he knows books and all.

18:04.097 --> 18:07.801
A lot of the people who come in here for interviews have never been around a rare book.

18:08.362 --> 18:09.082
That's for sure.

18:11.105 --> 18:12.606
Oh, that's just what it is.

18:14.037 --> 18:34.296
This is one of the great books.

18:34.316 --> 18:36.398
There is a copy of a book.

18:36.418 --> 18:38.840
There's one called Helen Courtship.

18:38.860 --> 18:40.822
There's one called May Day.

18:41.582 --> 18:43.504
And there's one called The Wishing Tree.

18:43.923 --> 18:47.707
These all came within about a half year period where he made these little gift books.

18:48.448 --> 18:49.328
And he gave them.

18:49.348 --> 18:53.973
And this he gave ostensibly to Estelle's daughter, Victoria.

18:53.993 --> 18:59.819
But in fact, it was, I feel strongly, that it was a gesture, a courting gesture.

19:04.083 --> 19:05.224
This is really beautiful.

19:06.966 --> 19:08.288
It's one of the really great books.

19:12.432 --> 19:13.693
If you were a book collector,

19:14.028 --> 19:18.772
and could get this one book, you probably wouldn't have to collect any of the rest of the collection.

19:18.792 --> 19:22.656
If you own just this one book, you could say, I've got the best partner at Ridgetown.

19:23.116 --> 19:29.422
This one came from Victoria's daughter, Victoria, and it came, I snatched it up.

19:29.442 --> 19:30.803
This was the one that was at Virginia.

19:31.043 --> 19:31.804
I snatched this.

19:31.924 --> 19:37.649
There was material in here that was at Princeton, there was material that was at Roanoke, there was material that was at Virginia.

19:38.770 --> 19:40.372
This is how it goes for you.

19:40.472 --> 19:43.174
This one came right out of Virginia, and they were a gas.

19:43.930 --> 19:50.159
I'll tell you that story in the car.

19:50.240 --> 19:51.041
Do you remember?

19:51.101 --> 19:51.381
Sure.

19:51.461 --> 19:54.666
That one and the one about the money.

19:54.766 --> 20:03.019
We're just talking about this, the widow O'Callaghan's book, which William signed when he was 11 years old.

20:04.079 --> 20:07.863
You said that you got it for $50 because a man wanted the owner.

20:08.003 --> 20:09.104
He wanted a real nice dinner.

20:09.124 --> 20:13.469
He wanted to go out to dinner, and he knew you were collecting, so you... He wanted me to have the book.

20:13.689 --> 20:14.890
He would have given me the book.

20:15.150 --> 20:16.952
He actually had offered to give me the book.

20:16.992 --> 20:18.394
I said, how about a great dinner?

20:18.834 --> 20:20.175
He said, that would be wonderful.

20:20.636 --> 20:21.857
He was a very kind man.

20:21.877 --> 20:22.838
He wasn't a collector.

20:23.339 --> 20:26.221
He was very close friends with John's wife.

20:26.262 --> 20:30.486
John was already dead, but John's wife was still alive, Lucille Ramey Fong.

20:31.106 --> 20:32.668
And Lucille had given him the book.

20:33.121 --> 20:34.142
So you paid $50.

20:34.242 --> 20:35.304
I gave him $50.

20:35.344 --> 20:37.286
And I said, would $50 be fine?

20:38.167 --> 20:40.710
This was about eight or 10 years ago in Oxford.

20:41.471 --> 20:44.795
And I didn't give him more because it would have been inappropriate to give him more.

20:45.235 --> 20:49.080
I wasn't going to offer this man $1,000 or $2,000 because he was giving me a gift.

20:49.420 --> 20:51.162
He had worked with me down there on an exhibit.

20:51.202 --> 20:52.304
He wanted me to have the book.

20:52.764 --> 20:54.206
He had virtually given me the book.

20:54.286 --> 20:55.888
He said, I want you to put this in your collection.

20:56.763 --> 20:58.366
I said, how about a nice dinner?

20:58.386 --> 21:00.510
He said, oh, I'd love a real nice dinner.

21:00.530 --> 21:06.941
And you have been offered $35,000 for this book by another collector, by a dealer?

21:06.962 --> 21:07.322
By a dealer.

21:08.244 --> 21:13.654
But I wouldn't sell the book because it's, I wouldn't sell it simply because it's part of the collection.

21:13.814 --> 21:18.282
And if I ever had sold it, it would be only, the only impulse there would be to have

21:18.464 --> 21:19.846
Sold it to buy manuscripts.

21:19.926 --> 21:21.287
But this book is too early.

21:21.568 --> 21:22.629
This book is really lovely.

21:22.789 --> 21:23.650
This is from the cradle.

21:23.850 --> 21:25.092
This is close to the cradle.

21:25.132 --> 21:27.675
This is when the formative billy was beginning at age 11.

21:28.316 --> 21:29.497
Are you taking this or is it?

21:29.517 --> 21:31.359
No, but if you want to borrow it.

21:32.020 --> 21:33.562
Is that your inscribed copy?

21:33.762 --> 21:35.304
I don't have an inscribed copy.

21:35.925 --> 21:38.108
Carl did sign one, didn't he?

21:38.128 --> 21:43.094
What do you do when they provide pleasure from the pallet?

21:43.774 --> 21:45.096
We've got time now.

21:45.116 --> 21:45.957
We're in the car.

21:46.645 --> 22:04.867
One of the reassuring things for me, Nick, has been that in acquiring the materials, not from book dealers, but rather from those who have owned the materials and have been given the materials by Faulkner or had them come to them through their family, the reassuring thing has been that I know they're authentic.

22:05.888 --> 22:13.918
And quite often, I can look at a Faulkner signature, such as a number of signatures in both the Stone Archive and the

22:14.270 --> 22:27.773
Cummins archive were signed when Faulkner was so drunk, they would not have asked my muster had they come to me from a book dealer and simply been signed but not presented.

22:27.973 --> 22:35.907
I've seen even, I've got a book inscribed to Phil Stone, W-I-L-L-L-I-A-M.

22:36.157 --> 22:40.283
I've got another one that is worse than that, but I've forgotten how it goes now.

22:40.323 --> 22:43.929
But some of them were written, especially toward the later years.

22:43.949 --> 22:47.575
I have a couple copies of the town that are presentation copies.

22:48.216 --> 22:49.538
I'll try to pull this out right.

22:50.299 --> 22:59.734
One of them he did to his step-granddaughter, Victoria Johnson, my friend, inscribed the book to her when he had gone up to visit her at school.

23:00.615 --> 23:01.877
And it said,

23:02.988 --> 23:04.090
Oh, shit.

23:04.110 --> 23:04.891
Where did she go?

23:04.911 --> 23:05.913
I want to say Bryn Mawr.

23:06.634 --> 23:15.990
And so he said to Vic Pick from Abbey, Bryn Mawr, Mississippi.

23:16.050 --> 23:18.755
And I'll confirm that with you because it was wonderful.

23:18.775 --> 23:25.446
But instead of Massachusetts, it came out not M-A-S-S, but in fact M-I-S-S.

23:26.428 --> 23:29.012
But there were so many that he signed.

23:29.330 --> 23:31.113
Isn't Bryn Mawr in Pennsylvania?

23:31.153 --> 23:33.757
Well, then I've got the wrong one, because it's something in Massachusetts.

23:33.838 --> 23:35.560
Yeah, Vassar, my whole wheel.

23:35.801 --> 23:37.464
You've got to look it up.

23:37.484 --> 23:39.527
But the point is, you've got it on tape.

23:39.547 --> 23:50.586
And the real point is, there are signatures that if I myself didn't know the provenance of, I would have also found it real questionable.

23:51.687 --> 23:54.392
You mentioned the thing about Princeton.

23:54.811 --> 23:57.975
and about how they're hoping to get the shiny collection and believe they will.

23:57.995 --> 23:58.997
They probably will, yeah.

23:59.017 --> 24:10.352
They have had on file for the last 30 years the Saks Cummins, Dorothy Cummins materials, which are absolutely wonderful.

24:10.372 --> 24:11.373
They are voluminous.

24:12.194 --> 24:14.778
Many, many manuscripts of Eugene O'Neill, C.P.

24:14.898 --> 24:22.708
Snow, all the people that Saks Cummins worked with, they had four wonderful containers of manuscripts and letters

24:23.448 --> 24:31.046
on trial there, on deposit, that they knew they were going to be the recipient of at some point.

24:32.249 --> 24:35.176
When I met Dorothy Cummins, first I wrote her.

24:35.337 --> 24:39.988
I corresponded a number of times before she felt comfortable enough to invite me to come up.

24:40.694 --> 24:49.209
I think I told you I would tell you the story about the resentment that she had for Joe Blotner because he had virtually excluded her husband from his biography.

24:49.229 --> 24:57.724
She knew exactly how important Saks Cummins was to Faulkner in the last 20 years of Faulkner's life.

24:57.744 --> 25:00.829
Actually, almost 25 years.

25:01.366 --> 25:11.603
Dorothy and Sacks had been like mother and father to Faulkner in the last decade of his life when he had terrible drinking problems.

25:11.623 --> 25:21.400
In the mid to early 50s, and throughout the 50s really, Faulkner virtually spent a great deal of time at the Cummins residence in Princeton.

25:22.848 --> 25:27.112
Sacks had acquired many, many letters that he'd kept, lots of manuscripts.

25:27.613 --> 25:38.824
They were all, after Sacks' death at 58, Dorothy kept them for two or three or four years, more or less inventoried them, put them on deposit.

25:38.844 --> 25:42.328
Fortunately, no one had been allowed to get in them.

25:42.348 --> 25:43.128
I knew they were there.

25:43.148 --> 25:50.796
When I came up finally to visit Dorothy in Princeton, the very first time I came up, all we did was

25:51.130 --> 26:00.134
meet, and I got to meet her daughter, Frances Cummins Bennett, the wife of William Bennett, who was the master of Silliman College at Yale.

26:01.116 --> 26:05.528
That was to my great good fortune, because as it turned out, I was not only a Yaley,

26:05.862 --> 26:11.308
But I had spent three years in Sillman College, so we had a lot in common.

26:11.328 --> 26:12.649
There were other things in common.

26:13.130 --> 26:27.225
Most importantly was my appreciation of her husband, of Dorothy's husband, Sax, and an understanding that I had that I was equally riveted because Blotner had virtually excluded Sax from his biography.

26:27.826 --> 26:31.870
Well, she liked that because she really had felt slighted.

26:32.204 --> 26:37.989
She had a great love for her and respect for her deceased husband.

26:38.010 --> 26:42.314
I spent the first trip just talking with them and letting them get to know me.

26:42.334 --> 26:51.342
I went home with two inscribed copies that Frannie Cummins Bennett had brought with her from New Haven down to Princeton that weekend.

26:51.362 --> 26:53.204
That was all they were going to allow me to buy.

26:53.224 --> 26:55.726
Those were two that Frannie had on her shelves.

26:56.187 --> 26:57.868
I thought, well, that's fine.

26:57.888 --> 26:58.749
I knew there was more.

26:59.590 --> 27:01.772
I didn't get to see much more that first trip.

27:02.208 --> 27:09.599
The second trip I came back, at that point, we unloaded all of the books out of the house.

27:09.780 --> 27:11.602
At that point, they decided to sell me the books.

27:11.643 --> 27:13.245
They trusted me.

27:13.265 --> 27:23.942
So Dorothy said, it was on Franny's behest that Dorothy, who was going to hold onto those things forever, Dorothy was already in her high 80s, but she was going to hold onto those.

27:23.962 --> 27:28.148
Her daughter impressed upon her that I was not only honest and reputable at what I was doing,

27:28.499 --> 27:30.462
But what I was doing was real significant.

27:30.662 --> 27:35.048
I told Dorothy that I would try to address that problem, that imbalance.

27:35.669 --> 27:37.612
And I began writing all about sax.

27:37.732 --> 27:52.853
And you heard Bob Hamlin say the upshot of that was that in the one volume 1984 Faulkner biography, Faulkner interpolated sax in all over the place to show how important a role he played in Faulkner's last 25 years.

27:53.609 --> 28:05.224
That second trip, I went home with a couple suitcases of books, association copies, Sax's copies of Faulkner's books, and a bunch of inscribed copies, and I showed you a couple of them at the collection today.

28:05.244 --> 28:07.728
I came back up for a third visit.

28:07.748 --> 28:10.932
Dorothy said, I want to tell you, I walked in the front door.

28:11.512 --> 28:17.460
She had just had a cab deliver four big boxes from the Firestone Library.

28:17.500 --> 28:18.422
They were mortified.

28:18.802 --> 28:21.085
They couldn't believe she was asking to take them out.

28:21.757 --> 28:46.819
They acquiesced to her wishes. They sent them over in a cab that she requested just like that. They were sitting in Dorothy's living room, the four boxes on a settee when I arrived that saturday morning. Do wished me a very cordial welcome and then she said LD

28:47.457 --> 29:01.652
I've got these things here that you wanted to see, but I must tell you right now, I gave my absolute promise to the head of the library, and I've forgotten his name, that I would have these bounces back Monday morning sharp.

29:01.672 --> 29:03.134
And my heart dropped.

29:03.154 --> 29:07.098
Because I thought, as I arrived there, well, this is the third visit.

29:07.118 --> 29:10.782
I know that Francis Franny

29:11.116 --> 29:23.548
would like me to have those materials because she knew what I was going to do with them, which was to keep them in one place and deal with them and publish them and make sure that people knew these were sacks as artifacts.

29:23.708 --> 29:27.612
I knew after I walked in that morning that I wasn't about to get those materials.

29:27.672 --> 29:33.477
There was no way because she was absolutely resolute when she looked me straight in the eye and said, LD, these are here for you to look at.

29:33.497 --> 29:34.038
Here they are.

29:34.478 --> 29:38.322
But I have given my promise to such and such as I told you.

29:38.977 --> 29:42.524
So I thought right away, uh-oh, how are you going to look around this one?

29:42.544 --> 29:43.145
You are dead.

29:44.087 --> 29:45.068
There was no way.

29:45.149 --> 29:48.535
So I almost didn't want to look at him because that would be too upsetting.

29:49.537 --> 29:51.220
Well, we got into that.

29:51.240 --> 29:59.736
It turned out that Francis and Bill took the train down from New Haven because they wanted to be with me again.

29:59.986 --> 30:02.611
And we had a lovely afternoon and a lovely evening.

30:02.631 --> 30:09.786
And to cut that story short, by Sunday morning, Frannie had convinced her mother that I was the right person to have those artifacts.

30:10.427 --> 30:15.598
And there was, among that group, were 125 letters from Faulkner to Sacks and Dorothy Cummins.

30:15.848 --> 30:17.371
many of them had written letters.

30:17.692 --> 30:18.553
That was just part of it.

30:18.614 --> 30:21.620
There were all kinds of manuscripts of essays that you left there.

30:22.341 --> 30:28.554
All the materials, there were 50 pages of Fable manuscript, 50 pages of Requiem for a Polograph.

30:28.614 --> 30:29.215
Yeah, they're there.

30:29.295 --> 30:30.818
I didn't show them to you there.

30:30.959 --> 30:33.063
Fantastic materials.

30:34.045 --> 30:36.169
Franny had convinced Doe

30:36.335 --> 30:41.602
that I was the one to have them, that Princeton had abused them by not even keeping them well.

30:41.622 --> 30:44.185
They kept them downstairs where it was wet.

30:44.525 --> 30:46.868
I had showed them where all the staples were rusting.

30:47.309 --> 30:49.932
I said, you're letting these things get ruined.

30:49.952 --> 30:51.474
They're not being treated right.

30:51.614 --> 30:52.776
I wasn't trying to do Princeton.

30:52.796 --> 30:54.117
I was trying to show them.

30:54.137 --> 30:55.199
I'm going to stop here.

30:55.219 --> 30:56.100
You're going to come talk.

30:56.120 --> 30:56.380
All right.

30:56.561 --> 31:02.528
By Sunday afternoon, when Franny and Bill left to return to New Haven,

31:03.082 --> 31:05.244
Doe was extremely pleased.

31:05.264 --> 31:07.866
I had written them a check for $30,000.

31:09.007 --> 31:12.911
That money was to be split between Franny, her brother, and Doe.

31:13.811 --> 31:17.975
It was not a matter of money, though they considered that a pretty good sum.

31:17.995 --> 31:19.416
That was more than I had.

31:19.777 --> 31:21.318
When the boat was this?

31:21.658 --> 31:23.540
This was maybe in 85.

31:23.700 --> 31:24.541
That's pretty recent.

31:24.561 --> 31:24.941
84.

31:25.121 --> 31:26.383
It was recent.

31:26.403 --> 31:28.785
We can look it up.

31:29.385 --> 31:32.548
I had worked for about a year before Doe would even

31:32.782 --> 31:34.784
respond to me, really.

31:34.804 --> 31:40.952
And the result was I went home with these precious, precious manuscripts.

31:40.992 --> 31:42.193
Well, they just sent letters.

31:42.474 --> 31:52.726
So Princeton had no... Oh, so the upshot of all that was that when Princeton discovered Monday morning that there were no boxes returned to them, the archival boxes, they called over.

31:53.687 --> 32:00.055
And they were absolutely mortified to learn that they were no longer in Dorothy's possession, that they had gone to St.

32:00.075 --> 32:02.518
Louis to the collector, Louis Brodsky, who they knew.

32:02.752 --> 32:05.315
And they were beside themselves.

32:05.335 --> 32:07.298
Oh, why didn't you give us a chance to buy them?

32:07.739 --> 32:10.182
And at that point, Dorothy told me that angered her.

32:10.783 --> 32:15.288
She said, if they had really wanted them, why didn't they ever make an offer before?

32:16.130 --> 32:20.976
And Franny had already told her that Sunday, because they'd been there for many, many years.

32:21.336 --> 32:22.959
They assumed they were going to be given.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.223
I said, no one should make that assumption.

32:26.283 --> 32:27.865
And that is not a given thing.

32:28.165 --> 32:31.688
The assumption is not a given.

32:31.808 --> 32:35.231
I pulled them right out from her.

32:35.251 --> 32:36.792
I'm going to tell you something that was a coup.

32:38.033 --> 32:39.054
May but may not be on there.

32:39.575 --> 32:40.656
Let me tell you how it happened.

32:40.976 --> 32:41.696
It wasn't money.

32:42.117 --> 32:42.777
It was trust.

32:43.838 --> 32:47.461
And it wouldn't have happened even with Dorothy, who loved me and who did trust me.

32:47.802 --> 32:50.164
But she was too set in her ways and she was too old.

32:50.904 --> 32:54.908
And she wasn't going to make any changes because Sachs had put him there.

32:55.088 --> 32:57.750
And Doe, I guess, had put him there after he died.

32:58.304 --> 33:02.351
Franny knew and knew that I was honest and that my intentions were good.

33:03.092 --> 33:05.255
And so it was never a matter of discussing money.

33:05.295 --> 33:07.379
I made an offer and they accepted it.

33:07.759 --> 33:09.041
I said, this is all I can pay.

33:09.202 --> 33:10.283
I think this is quite fair.

33:10.824 --> 33:12.968
Well, it was and it wasn't.

33:12.988 --> 33:15.292
I mean, how was I going to pay for them?

33:15.312 --> 33:15.792
That's great.

33:15.832 --> 33:17.415
Have you checked anybody from Princeton?

33:17.435 --> 33:17.876
No.

33:18.397 --> 33:22.003
They didn't try to.

33:22.023 --> 33:25.408
The nature of a collector is to be a schlepper.

33:26.688 --> 33:27.989
Have you dealt with that one?

33:28.009 --> 33:31.593
We're all, we're all, um, schleppers.

33:31.734 --> 33:32.534
I'll go for it.

33:32.554 --> 33:32.935
Okay.

33:32.955 --> 33:38.121
Well, what I mean, I guess by that, and you probably already know too well what I mean by that, is that we haul stuff.

33:38.161 --> 33:38.761
We're haulers.

33:39.342 --> 33:40.303
We move shit around.

33:40.323 --> 33:41.624
I thought they used to have a phone here.

33:41.644 --> 33:42.205
Where'd it go?

33:42.666 --> 33:44.007
I think... Oh, fuck.

33:44.107 --> 33:44.968
I know they did.

33:44.988 --> 33:47.050
I think it's on the other side of the... See, it used to be right there.

33:47.391 --> 33:49.433
It's on the other side of the... Okay.

33:49.453 --> 33:50.554
On the other side of the... Okay.

33:50.714 --> 33:53.397
I'll go look, because I want to make sure, and if not, I'll go over there.

33:54.058 --> 33:55.079
I just don't want to fail.

33:55.179 --> 33:56.661
I want to not fail to do this.

33:57.670 --> 33:58.611
Oh, good.

33:58.631 --> 33:59.192
You saw it.

33:59.272 --> 33:59.932
I see it now.

33:59.973 --> 34:01.795
They did move it.

34:01.815 --> 34:02.375
That's good.

34:03.777 --> 34:04.478
How do you like that?

34:04.778 --> 34:05.879
Well, I see why they moved it.

34:05.899 --> 34:07.000
They expanded their space.

34:07.020 --> 34:09.924
They never used to have this lacing in this truck.

34:09.944 --> 34:11.025
Let me just do that real quick.

34:17.632 --> 34:20.495
So, oh, remind me to tell you the story to add on to that.

34:21.156 --> 34:22.818
I'm not going to get into that whole story with you now.

34:22.838 --> 34:23.919
That's a whole different story.

34:23.999 --> 34:25.821
I've tried to stay on the book collecting.

34:26.037 --> 34:37.051
But why I am the way I am is because the tensions that power my dynamic have come out of those two basic instincts.

34:37.231 --> 34:41.977
One was to be what my dad had been, which was part of our heritage.

34:42.798 --> 34:46.463
And the other part was to be not an esthetician, but a poet, an artist.

34:47.664 --> 34:52.090
And all that stuff combined in a real nice way finally, but not without a lot of pain.

34:52.130 --> 34:52.230
Yeah.

34:52.379 --> 34:54.161
You said there's another story.

34:54.242 --> 34:58.347
Yeah, I want to just add to the Princeton story with the Cummins archive.

34:58.788 --> 35:04.676
On the second visit, when I brought back a lot of books, those were inscribed books, and I showed you some.

35:04.696 --> 35:05.938
They were association copies.

35:05.958 --> 35:07.199
Did you pull that out of Princeton, too?

35:07.259 --> 35:07.680
No, no.

35:07.720 --> 35:09.703
Those came out of Dorothy Cummins' house.

35:09.723 --> 35:10.744
Okay, we know about that.

35:10.764 --> 35:11.405
On Elm Street.

35:11.425 --> 35:14.469
Well, what I was going to tell you about the story, it was kind of funny.

35:14.489 --> 35:18.775
It has also been part of the whole bag, if you will, of collecting for me.

35:19.075 --> 35:20.678
is that I have been a schlepper.

35:21.279 --> 35:28.894
I own one of Client Brooks' wonderful old suitcases, I have one of Jim Silver's suitcases, and I have one of Sacks Cummins'.

35:28.914 --> 35:41.539
It seems that wherever I'd go, I would underestimate myself, and I would come back, as I did on that second trip from the Cummins home, with his entire Faulkner collection of his own shelf copies.

35:42.025 --> 35:52.620
And I had to go write notes and put them in all of them, because Sacks, unlike most people, had a habit of not writing his name in his books, none of them in his library.

35:52.640 --> 35:53.542
I take that fact.

35:53.562 --> 35:57.748
He had one copy of Absalom, Absalom, the first book he edited for coffee.

35:57.768 --> 35:59.791
It says Sacks Cummins on the pastedown.

36:00.191 --> 36:02.194
But all the rest of them didn't have his name in them.

36:02.647 --> 36:07.932
I had Doe make up provenance papers, if you will, pedigrees that we put in all those.

36:07.952 --> 36:14.318
She sat up one night with her little shaky hand writing those wonderful notes and was very proud to do it on her stationery.

36:14.338 --> 36:20.064
I came home, the upshot, I'd gone up with one bag, and I thought, fine, and my little handbag.

36:20.084 --> 36:31.675
I came back with four bags, and I was in real big trouble because I was taking the commuter back from Princeton into New York, and it arrived at the one station.

36:32.245 --> 36:37.111
that I had to then go from the one station over to another station.

36:37.131 --> 36:46.782
And so I had to get the four bags off of the commuter all the way through that enormous station, whichever, I think it was Pennsylvania station, but I'm not sure.

36:46.802 --> 36:48.304
It could have been.

36:48.424 --> 36:49.406
It was a nightmare.

36:50.106 --> 36:54.612
It was an absolute nightmare trying to get those four heavy bags.

36:54.632 --> 36:57.936
Those two bags that I borrowed from them to fill up with his books.

36:57.956 --> 36:59.738
What was the significance of his books?

37:00.494 --> 37:03.939
They were his books and they were association copies.

37:04.080 --> 37:12.533
For me to have the Faulkner books that Sachs Cummins, his editor, had had in his collection... Yeah, but they aren't signed or anything like that.

37:12.553 --> 37:15.337
No, but now they have the provenance papers in them.

37:15.357 --> 37:18.202
And they're very important, because they weren't Sachs' own books.

37:18.222 --> 37:21.547
But they aren't annotated or anything, they're just his copies.

37:21.567 --> 37:22.849
In that case, that's true.

37:22.869 --> 37:25.233
What archival significance do they have?

37:25.814 --> 37:26.535
Not much.

37:26.701 --> 37:30.346
All I can say is that I can... They're nice.

37:30.366 --> 37:33.690
Well, they were Sachs' copies.

37:33.831 --> 37:35.012
Virtually, yes.

37:35.032 --> 37:37.976
Because I didn't ask Sachs not to do that.

37:37.996 --> 37:44.325
Virtually every other association copy that I brought back and put in the collection has been heavily annotated.

37:44.345 --> 37:45.646
Sachs, of course, wasn't a critic.

37:45.947 --> 37:46.808
Sachs was an editor.

37:47.289 --> 37:52.135
By the time Sachs had the books, they were finished products, is right.

37:52.655 --> 37:56.541
Sax would do all of his noting, blue penciling on the galleys.

37:56.561 --> 37:57.502
It would be nice to have them.

37:58.123 --> 38:01.088
Well, I do have a lot of them.

38:01.108 --> 38:02.450
I have galley proofs.

38:02.470 --> 38:04.914
I have a lot of Sax's.

38:06.155 --> 38:07.417
I won't say I have a lot of them.

38:07.497 --> 38:09.320
I don't have a lot of those.

38:09.340 --> 38:12.145
Those corrections, I don't know where all of those are.

38:12.165 --> 38:15.790
His editorializing, I don't know where all that is.

38:15.830 --> 38:16.912
Not a lot of that, that's true.

38:16.992 --> 38:20.417
Did he fool around a lot with Buckness?

38:22.068 --> 38:24.332
Yes, he fooled around heavily with a fable.

38:24.993 --> 38:40.320
Matter of fact, one of the wonderful things I remember that Doe was telling me one night, she said, the two boys were down on the floor here on their hands and knees with that whole huge manuscript spread out all over our living room floor reordering the manuscript.

38:40.500 --> 38:41.922
And she said, I'll never forget that.

38:41.942 --> 38:46.911
She said, but those two boys, she said, the sad thing was, by the 50s,

38:47.077 --> 38:50.921
They both had gotten old, and they both were very depressed.

38:50.941 --> 38:52.422
And she said, I hated to see that.

38:52.722 --> 38:54.564
She said Bill was always on our doorstep.

38:54.624 --> 39:02.151
She said we'd come home sometime from shopping or something else, and there would be Bill on our doorstep, literally sitting, waiting for us to come home.

39:02.171 --> 39:07.696
In the 50s, he really wasn't around Oxford much at all, and I've documented that in letters and everything else.

39:07.716 --> 39:14.262
One of the great privileges I had, let me tell you about fulfilling the promise I made to Doe Cummins and her daughter, Franny.

39:14.803 --> 39:16.324
One of the great privileges I had

39:16.540 --> 39:24.491
was to bring out volume two of the letters as volume two of a comprehensive guide to the Brodsky collection.

39:24.511 --> 39:30.079
In that volume, we published about 85 or 90 letters from Faulkner to Sachs and Dorothy.

39:31.020 --> 39:33.444
They were just so stunning.

39:33.484 --> 39:35.126
They were wonderful letters.

39:35.246 --> 39:42.496
And they were from Faulkner and from Estelle to Sachs and Dorothy.

39:42.516 --> 39:46.041
So between them, we published about 125 or 30.

39:46.274 --> 39:53.583
And they show you so much about where Faulkner was and where he wasn't in the 50s.

39:53.603 --> 39:59.089
And Estelle so often really physically, literally, did not know where Billy was.

40:00.231 --> 40:02.834
Sax, is Billy and Princeton in your home?

40:02.854 --> 40:03.675
Is he there with you?

40:04.316 --> 40:07.279
Things like that.

40:07.540 --> 40:09.943
That's a wonderful archive.

40:09.963 --> 40:10.543
Yeah, that's nice.

40:10.563 --> 40:13.006
Was there one other thing you were going to tell me about, too?

40:13.026 --> 40:14.408
Yes, one of the other...

40:15.046 --> 40:23.361
if you will, appropriations that I made was, again, a dint of persistence.

40:23.381 --> 40:38.389
I befriended, and it was a long befriending, Victoria Fieldon Johnson, William Faulkner's granddaughter.

40:38.409 --> 40:39.130
I met her in Oxford early on.

40:39.481 --> 40:40.983
I liked her very much.

40:41.003 --> 40:42.845
She was very outspoken.

40:42.865 --> 40:48.953
She disliked all the publicity that surrounded the people in Oxford who were part of the Faulkner family.

40:48.973 --> 40:57.604
And she was part of the Faulkner family and hated to be dealt with sort of officiously.

40:57.624 --> 40:59.987
And so she finally left Oxford

41:00.187 --> 41:03.493
and moved down to Cape Coral, Florida.

41:03.513 --> 41:05.716
I visited her on many occasions, and I interviewed her.

41:05.736 --> 41:09.342
I think she's a very brilliant and very insightful person.

41:09.362 --> 41:10.003
She's our age.

41:11.185 --> 41:13.048
She's about 51.

41:14.511 --> 41:21.182
She lived at Roanoke for many, many years, off and on, and knew her papi.

41:21.837 --> 41:26.702
William Faulkner, extremely well, was very close to Pappy.

41:26.722 --> 41:31.307
I ended up acquiring all of that archive, which was the Fielden archive.

41:31.327 --> 41:36.433
Her mother, Victoria Chocho, Fielden, F-I-E-L-D-E-N.

41:36.453 --> 41:47.225
Victoria's mother, Victoria, also, whom Faulkner had dubbed Chocho when they were young, she had kept many inscribed books.

41:47.245 --> 41:49.127
Well, she had passed away, I said.

41:49.428 --> 41:58.418
So the daughter, Victoria, the only child, had this entire archive of manuscripts, inscribed books, letters, wonderful letters.

41:58.618 --> 42:03.403
I, over a period of time, acquired all those materials from Victoria.

42:04.264 --> 42:10.271
Victoria developed a great trust in me and knew that I also wouldn't capitalize.

42:11.492 --> 42:18.760
One thing I did with Victoria to enforce or enhance

42:19.128 --> 42:21.753
her appreciation of my good intentions.

42:22.595 --> 42:27.784
I said, Victoria, yes, I will buy all these materials from you, but I make you a promise and I'll put it in writing.

42:28.546 --> 42:32.794
And she appreciated that because she didn't want them sold.

42:32.814 --> 42:37.583
She sold them to me because she knew they would stay at Southeast Missouri State in the Brodsky collection.

42:37.603 --> 42:39.647
So when was this really recent as well?

42:39.827 --> 42:41.490
This was done between

42:41.926 --> 43:05.537
it started maybe in 83 or 84 and it went through 88 or 87. I don't know, we'll have to check the dates. Maybe it started fairly recently. Yes, within this past decade. And she wanted them all together. She did need money. She was very glad that someone like myself was acquiring those. She wouldn't put them out in the public.

43:06.293 --> 43:07.515
She allowed me to buy them.

43:07.535 --> 43:23.114
The promise I made her was, Victoria, I guarantee you and promise you that I will never sell these, and that if I ever do, I will allow you to buy them back for the exact price that I paid you for them, no matter what they're worth in the market.

43:23.134 --> 43:34.849
I also put in that agreement, this does not include you having the opportunity to reacquire them if I donate them, if I give them, because that really is, and I knew that was my intention.

43:35.150 --> 43:38.013
and put them in the public domain to donate them.

43:38.033 --> 43:43.600
They were indeed donated to Southeast Missouri State, the state of Missouri.

43:44.321 --> 43:47.004
They were given, and she knew that, and she was very pleased.

43:47.024 --> 43:49.647
She did not want those materials to go to Mississippi.

43:50.488 --> 43:55.614
She hated Mississippi because of the way they had disrespected Pappy.

43:55.634 --> 43:59.419
They had shown the whole Faulkner family great disrespect over the years.

43:59.888 --> 44:02.552
the University of Mississippi until the last few years.

44:02.592 --> 44:07.860
They, like everyone else in Oxford, considered that he was Count No Count, and they treated him accordingly.

44:07.880 --> 44:11.025
It wasn't until the end of the 40s that they began to show him any kind of respect.

44:11.566 --> 44:17.815
And because of that, you asked me why the materials that Faulkner had kept all his manuscripts went to Virginia.

44:17.835 --> 44:18.977
Well, Virginia courted him.

44:19.261 --> 44:23.327
Linton Massey, the great Faulkner collector, put his collection in Virginia.

44:23.347 --> 44:25.891
Linton Massey courted Faulkner.

44:25.911 --> 44:30.578
Faulkner lived in Charlottesville, where the University of Virginia was.

44:30.598 --> 44:32.661
He was the writer-in-residence in 57 through 59.

44:32.681 --> 44:34.243
His daughter, Jill, lived there.

44:34.303 --> 44:35.325
They bought a home there.

44:35.345 --> 44:37.208
It all helped.

44:37.248 --> 44:38.209
He liked being courted.

44:38.950 --> 44:42.475
People there really showed him respect, and so there they went.

44:44.759 --> 44:44.859
Fine.

44:44.879 --> 44:46.922
Victoria's mother, Victoria,

44:47.088 --> 45:10.395
had put her one cherished item at the University of Virginia because she felt it was so valuable. It was a little book, handmade by her stepfather William, Billy, she called him, called The Wishing Tree, a story which Bill, Billy told Victoria was written for her. It was a child story. She kept the other items

45:10.763 --> 45:11.464
at their home.

45:11.624 --> 45:17.310
But she put the one item on deposit, her copy of The Wishing Tree, the one of a kind that you've seen now.

45:17.350 --> 45:18.491
Which I handled.

45:18.511 --> 45:19.913
Which you handled.

45:19.933 --> 45:22.596
It was on deposit at Virginia for years and years.

45:23.497 --> 45:25.299
Victoria and I had talked about it.

45:25.939 --> 45:30.004
She said, well, you know, Mama put that there, and that'll be very difficult to get back.

45:30.024 --> 45:32.927
And I'm not sure I want to get it back, because that was Mama's intention.

45:33.247 --> 45:37.632
Over a period of time, as I acquired more and more of the materials, the archive,

45:37.915 --> 45:41.331
And again, another thing, by the way, I'm taking an offshoot here ancillarily.

45:42.075 --> 45:46.677
What Victoria liked about what I was doing was that I was writing about the collection.

45:47.011 --> 45:50.635
I was writing piece after piece about the other few that happened.

45:50.655 --> 45:51.856
I don't know how you cut that.

45:51.876 --> 45:54.038
I was going to cut that pattern, Virginia.

45:54.098 --> 45:58.743
Well, Victoria and I became extremely close, and we were for many, many years.

45:59.104 --> 46:01.626
How long had it been on deposit in Virginia now at this point?

46:01.666 --> 46:03.528
I would say 15 years at least.

46:03.548 --> 46:04.590
So they figured it was theirs.

46:04.610 --> 46:07.393
They did indeed believe it was hers, and that again was theirs.

46:07.653 --> 46:08.714
They believed it was theirs.

46:09.194 --> 46:14.520
It had been there, and they thought by statute of limitations or by default or just by quiesce,

46:15.682 --> 46:16.825
that it belonged to them.

46:16.885 --> 46:19.411
But let me tell you a story when you're done with this, all right?

46:19.892 --> 46:20.052
Okay.

46:20.132 --> 46:22.798
That sat there, and they just knew it was theirs.

46:23.981 --> 46:29.674
Victoria had now sold me virtually everything in the collection, and we got down to the one book.

46:30.245 --> 46:34.009
I said, Victoria, it is extremely important.

46:34.089 --> 46:36.692
Yes, but I didn't want it because it was valuable.

46:36.712 --> 46:41.838
I wanted it because... I wanted it because it needed to be with the rest of the archive.

46:42.398 --> 46:47.364
I said the fact that your mother put it there was only because it was so valuable that she was afraid something would happen to it.

46:47.384 --> 46:51.308
You felt no pains about absconding from Virginia with this.

46:51.849 --> 46:52.710
I didn't have gone.

46:52.730 --> 46:55.052
That's a long run.

46:55.253 --> 46:56.854
Pulling it out from under them.

46:56.934 --> 46:59.357
Quite the contrary, I thought it was extremely important.

46:59.337 --> 47:05.088
And then she became aware that if Virginia had ever wanted that book, why hadn't they made her an offer?

47:05.108 --> 47:08.354
So, I didn't like to hear that from Victoria.

47:08.374 --> 47:18.814
I had made Victoria a rather, what I thought was a sizable offer, or the one that she would find sizable, of $5,000.

47:19.936 --> 47:22.020
What happened was that Virginia,

47:23.198 --> 47:32.938
When Victoria wrote them the first time saying, I would like the book that my mother put on deposit, the wishing tree, will you please send it back at once?

47:32.958 --> 47:34.461
That's all she wrote in the first letter.

47:35.143 --> 47:37.929
She did not write in the letter that she was selling it.

47:38.430 --> 47:41.055
She said, I would like the book, will you please send it to me?

47:41.322 --> 47:44.606
There was a period of about three weeks when she had no response.

47:44.646 --> 47:46.829
There's cardiac arrest going on.

47:47.270 --> 47:49.092
She called them.

47:49.192 --> 47:51.856
She said, I hope you receive my letter.

47:52.437 --> 47:59.466
She said, I hope you appreciate that I wrote and that you got my letter.

47:59.486 --> 48:02.731
I would like you to send my book.

48:02.751 --> 48:05.434
They said, oh, we did get the letter.

48:05.454 --> 48:07.617
We really didn't know what that implied.

48:08.508 --> 48:10.170
She said, well, I'll write you another one.

48:10.190 --> 48:12.673
I want you to please send the book.

48:12.793 --> 48:27.210
I am contemplating disposing of the book, and she put it that way, and I knew at that point now, we're back and forth, and I've been down in Cape Coral, and then I had gone home, and then she said, well, I feel obliged, I felt obliged to tell them why I wanted the book.

48:27.270 --> 48:30.013
I said, oh, I wish I hadn't told them that.

48:30.033 --> 48:32.777
So she said, I am considering disposing of it.

48:32.797 --> 48:35.680
They said, oh, well, Mrs. Johnson, in that case,

48:36.588 --> 48:41.113
we would like to have an opportunity to acquire that book.

48:41.133 --> 48:43.635
She wrote them the second letter saying, will you please send the book?

48:43.735 --> 48:49.161
And they wrote back a letter saying, will you give us an opportunity?

48:49.181 --> 48:57.069
She wrote them back again saying, Mr. Brodsky, I have been offered.

48:57.089 --> 49:02.955
I have had an offered tender to $5,000, and I intend to sell it to a collector.

49:02.975 --> 49:05.177
They said, we will offer you

49:06.271 --> 49:07.112
$10,000.

49:07.132 --> 49:08.834
Oh, no, no, no, no, sorry.

49:08.874 --> 49:09.494
Let's get this right.

49:09.715 --> 49:14.359
They said, we will offer you $5,000 for that item.

49:14.379 --> 49:19.064
She called me and she said, they have made a counteroffer that equals your offer.

49:19.084 --> 49:20.466
What am I supposed to think of that?

49:20.486 --> 49:24.390
I said, Victoria, number one, I want the book to come to this archive.

49:24.410 --> 49:25.270
It belongs here.

49:25.811 --> 49:29.014
All the other things, all your family photographs, your letters, everything.

49:29.034 --> 49:30.135
She said, yes, that's true.

49:30.155 --> 49:31.357
I certainly want it there.

49:31.377 --> 49:32.938
But they've offered me five.

49:33.118 --> 49:33.679
I said,

49:35.127 --> 49:36.429
Does that make you angry?

49:36.449 --> 49:38.651
She said, indeed, it didn't make me angry.

49:38.671 --> 49:39.693
She's very outspoken.

49:39.773 --> 49:45.560
And why it made me angry was because if they had wanted it, why never before had they made me an offer?

49:45.700 --> 49:48.163
Much the same that Dorothy Cummins said.

49:48.784 --> 49:50.526
She said, that makes me very angry.

49:50.546 --> 50:00.699
They've had that book for many, many years, and they have never so much as asked me if I might be willing to sell them the book, which at an earlier time, I probably would have.

50:00.719 --> 50:01.981
She said, now I'm quite angry.

50:02.061 --> 50:03.042
I said, Victoria,

50:03.308 --> 50:08.834
I will double my offer now, and I offer you $10,000 for the book.

50:08.854 --> 50:13.598
She said, that is sufficient, and I will not give them a chance to make another countdown.

50:13.678 --> 50:14.519
So I paid $10,000.

50:14.539 --> 50:15.660
So I paid $10,000.

50:15.680 --> 50:20.405
She wrote them again and said, I wish, I demand my book back.

50:20.425 --> 50:22.187
They sent the book, a special delivery.

50:22.287 --> 50:25.891
I was down at Victoria's in Cape Coral when the book arrived.

50:26.071 --> 50:27.693
Cape Coral, Florida.

50:28.093 --> 50:32.117
The Jeep arrived, and the postal lady got out and brought the package that I showed you.

50:32.452 --> 50:35.195
from which I took that book.

50:35.355 --> 50:36.757
It was such an exciting moment.

50:37.198 --> 50:38.559
Victoria got the book.

50:38.579 --> 50:40.361
I said, Victoria, you open the package.

50:40.381 --> 50:41.202
She handed it to me.

50:41.302 --> 50:43.725
I said, you open the package.

50:43.785 --> 50:44.706
She started to weep.

50:45.527 --> 50:47.910
She said, this is such a beautiful, beautiful book.

50:47.930 --> 50:49.592
She said, my mama always had it.

50:49.612 --> 50:53.577
And she would read to me the story because Pappy had written it for her.

50:54.177 --> 50:57.682
And she would often read it to me as a good night story.

50:58.162 --> 51:02.307
It was this beautiful child story of little Dorothy.

51:03.215 --> 51:04.878
That's right.

51:06.360 --> 51:07.482
Pull that one out.

51:08.764 --> 51:10.386
I'm trying to remember the story myself.

51:10.406 --> 51:11.648
I worked on it.

51:12.109 --> 51:13.691
The point is, she started weeping.

51:14.112 --> 51:15.614
And I got really weeping.

51:15.634 --> 51:19.901
And I was weeping because I was so moved that we'd gone through this long thing.

51:20.622 --> 51:24.408
All the time I knew that I was going to lose that book to Virginia.

51:24.428 --> 51:27.012
That they were going to end up offering some astounding offer.

51:27.312 --> 51:29.855
of like 25, 30, 40, 50 grand.

51:30.456 --> 51:31.678
I didn't have the money.

51:32.138 --> 51:35.783
I'm sure if they had offered that, that she would have taken it.

51:35.843 --> 51:37.265
And I didn't have the money.

51:37.285 --> 51:40.409
I knew the book was worth a lot of money.

51:40.469 --> 51:45.595
I knew the book was worth an awful lot of money in the book market.

51:45.615 --> 51:49.100
I also knew that I wasn't trying to buy that book to resell it.

51:49.480 --> 51:52.324
I also knew that I didn't have past $10,000.

51:52.861 --> 51:55.967
My mother gave me as a Christmas gift that Christmas.

51:56.569 --> 52:00.577
I came up with $5,000 that I borrowed, and my mother paid the other $5,000.

52:00.597 --> 52:02.561
This is the last five years, right?

52:02.581 --> 52:05.587
I'd say the last five years, yes.

52:05.607 --> 52:07.952
And it was a wonderful acquisition.

52:08.052 --> 52:10.397
And I bet you left Florida and didn't look back.

52:10.938 --> 52:11.699
Oh, and I couldn't.

52:11.940 --> 52:14.565
Do you do paperwork when you do this?

52:14.545 --> 52:18.670
Yes, yes, we had a bill of sale.

52:18.690 --> 52:20.913
But that, again, was part of it.

52:20.933 --> 52:22.575
I donated that to the state of Missouri.

52:22.595 --> 52:30.125
But what I'm saying is, she couldn't come back now and say I've changed my mind over and given you $5,000.

52:30.145 --> 52:31.266
No, she couldn't in Wooden.

52:31.286 --> 52:33.469
Wooden's a value judge.

52:33.489 --> 52:34.710
I'm looking for an agreement.

52:34.730 --> 52:37.294
I have a written agreement.

52:37.314 --> 52:41.419
We have bills of sale that we made for all of those items.

52:41.439 --> 52:43.101
And she also has my guarantee.

52:43.874 --> 52:51.621
And I also have it quite clearly stated in the agreement I made with Southeast Missouri State that all of those materials were gifted.

52:51.681 --> 52:53.263
Are we all set?

52:53.843 --> 52:55.185
I think so.

52:55.205 --> 52:55.745
That's three years.

52:55.805 --> 53:00.149
I haven't followed up a lot of this stuff.

53:00.169 --> 53:08.697
I was going to tell you a little upshot or coda to the Emily Stone story about going to Montgomery and acquiring that archive.

53:08.717 --> 53:11.400
I met Emily three and a half years later.

53:11.971 --> 53:14.834
When I came to Emily the first time, she was so destitute.

53:14.854 --> 53:17.056
She had not enough money to buy food.

53:17.076 --> 53:19.358
She didn't have enough money to buy herself a new pair of glasses.

53:19.718 --> 53:21.840
She was so grateful to me.

53:21.860 --> 53:26.424
L.D., I'm so grateful that you bought these, and I'm so happy that you have these.

53:26.444 --> 53:27.505
Thank you so much.

53:27.545 --> 53:33.530
And I gave her $35,000, which was $15,000 less than her asking price had been three years prior.

53:34.051 --> 53:37.714
And during the three years it had been there at $50,000, no one had bought it.

53:37.754 --> 53:38.675
Nobody had seen it.

53:38.695 --> 53:39.296
I told you that.

53:39.776 --> 53:41.978
Three and a half years after I bought it.

53:41.958 --> 53:47.264
the materials, I saw her in Jackson, Mississippi at a conference on Faulkner and the Law.

53:48.406 --> 53:59.999
She was so nasty toward me and so mean-spirited because apparently someone told her that she had sold the materials too cheaply.

54:00.019 --> 54:02.462
You know, when something sold, it's a whole lot easier for everybody else to want it.

54:02.482 --> 54:06.767
And once the checks cleared and the money sped, then it was like something delicate.

54:06.787 --> 54:10.632
So three and a half years later, she held it against me that I had bought the collection from her.

54:10.612 --> 54:16.983
That was really infuriated because it was really dishonest on her.

54:17.304 --> 54:19.788
My point is I would love to know.

54:20.109 --> 54:22.773
I'd love to talk to somebody.

54:22.793 --> 54:24.757
Well, Victoria might tell you why it was.

54:24.797 --> 54:26.359
She had great respect for me.

54:26.379 --> 54:27.321
Yeah, I'm not looking for it.

54:28.283 --> 54:29.625
She put them there again.

54:29.685 --> 54:30.747
She sold them to me.

54:31.655 --> 55:00.953
because she trusted me. Where does she live in Florida? I've got her address. I'll give it to you, but if you don't mind I'll tell you what let's think about it. Okay I think you ought to think about it. You think about it. The caliber of my scholarship made it much easier for Victoria to see my books that were published, for Victoria to have me tell her, Victoria I will publish a book on the Fieldens. There was virtually nothing written about her family, the Franklin side. Cornell Franklin

55:01.253 --> 55:05.560
married Estelle before William married Estelle.

55:05.580 --> 55:07.703
The Franklins have been treated very shabbily.

55:08.905 --> 55:12.951
I said to Victoria, I will do a lot of writing on the subject of your family.

55:12.971 --> 55:15.055
That appealed to her immensely.

55:15.075 --> 55:20.123
That wonderful interview I did, a version of that was first published in Southern Review.

55:20.203 --> 55:29.337
I promised her that if I could pull it off, I would publish it as an article, in a magazine, as a chapter in a book, and that ultimately I would make a book

55:29.924 --> 55:38.052
devoted to the Faulkner-Franklin-Fielden Archive.

55:38.072 --> 55:38.653
And I yet have to do that.

55:38.673 --> 55:44.478
Now, that was an unwritten but spoken promise that I made the Archie trust in me.

55:44.498 --> 55:45.659
And I will hold to that, too.

55:46.140 --> 55:49.083
I intend to make a book on the Faulkners, the Franklins, and the Fieldens.

55:49.103 --> 55:49.924
It's a wonderful, wonderful book.

55:49.944 --> 55:51.245
I see it already.

55:51.265 --> 55:53.947
I just haven't gotten to make it yet.

55:53.967 --> 55:56.590
It'll include memorabilia, letters,

55:56.992 --> 56:00.297
Photographs like crazy.

56:00.337 --> 56:01.619
Wonderful.

56:01.639 --> 56:05.805
So she trusted me and she wanted those archives in this collection.

56:05.825 --> 56:08.229
She knew I would do something with them.

56:08.249 --> 56:12.535
Franny Bennett, Dorothy Cummins' daughter, knew that I would do something with them.

56:12.556 --> 56:19.506
They felt very strongly that Princeton had neglected them and would continue to neglect them.

56:20.414 --> 56:22.077
That's how those two stories are.

56:22.097 --> 56:24.261
Kenneth Burden's done some of this stuff.

56:24.281 --> 56:25.924
Tell me about it.

56:26.165 --> 56:27.688
I'm not aware that he's done much of that.

56:27.908 --> 56:37.386
Well, I think you got the... I think the whole notion of ethics, if you're a collector, is absolutely tantamount.

56:37.666 --> 56:38.608
It's paramount.

56:38.993 --> 56:42.479
It is so important, and it was always in the forefront of my mind.

56:42.980 --> 56:48.230
I knew that I was very limited in terms of the cash I had, Nick, to spend on any of these acquisitions.

56:48.290 --> 56:52.919
I wasn't a public institution, and I didn't have Carter Burden's money, no matter what you might think.

56:52.939 --> 56:56.445
I did get my dad to help me, and over a period of time, he did help me.

56:56.847 --> 57:22.872
but his help was not of the kind that Carter's expenditures required, not even close. And I was not, and my dad is quite wealthy but the last thing he would ever do would be to take his money in any significant way spend it on books, because he thought that was totally triples and he always did. So what I did from my dad would be an occasional five or ten thousand dollars. I'm talking about maybe once every couple years

57:23.172 --> 57:48.775
to help me foot a bill, but that was the kind of thing, and that was grudging to get it out of him. So I had to be a little innovative in the way I'd done. So when I went into something like I did. As an example with The Wishing Tree, that if in the back of my mind I knew that book were a 50 to 60 thousand dollar book conceivably if I could go to the market and turn it around in there. I also knew that it wasn't worth that to me because i never had the money like that to spend it and it wasn't worth it to me because I wasn't going to sell it

57:49.345 --> 57:51.948
So that changed the whole parameter for me.

57:52.388 --> 57:53.770
I said, what is it worth?

57:53.990 --> 57:55.232
You can justify it.

57:55.372 --> 57:57.274
I would justify it honestly.

57:57.394 --> 58:02.219
Because in your soul, you knew that the ultimate destination would be a repository.

58:02.240 --> 58:05.563
That's precisely how every one got justified.

58:05.623 --> 58:07.586
And I would tell people up front.

58:07.606 --> 58:09.948
And I would not tell them, well, this book might be worth more.

58:09.968 --> 58:11.530
That wasn't part of it.

58:11.550 --> 58:17.817
But I would tell them, and I always knew I was never lying or deceiving, that these books would stay together.

58:18.083 --> 58:19.786
that they would go together with other books.

58:19.806 --> 58:25.594
I would say to someone like Bill Cummins, now your books are together with Malcolm Cowleys and Phil Stones.

58:25.614 --> 58:29.240
And the more collecting I did, the more impressive that became.

58:29.260 --> 58:33.867
And people wanted their collections to be with the big collections.

58:33.887 --> 58:40.798
And I really got to the point where I was extremely articulate with giving them my bill of sale, as it were, or my little shtick.

58:41.138 --> 58:42.420
The bottom line is

58:43.025 --> 58:44.407
It wasn't a line of shit.

58:44.427 --> 58:45.168
It never was.

58:45.428 --> 58:48.713
And I knew in my heart, I never once would deceive anybody.

58:48.753 --> 58:59.508
If I told Victoria Johnson that if I ever sold those books, I would let her have them back at the price she paid, that means she could double or quadruple them.

59:00.089 --> 59:04.034
I wouldn't give her money back and go quadruple them in the market.

59:04.054 --> 59:04.955
I would give her the books back.

59:04.975 --> 59:07.619
That is where I go off the record scene.

59:08.560 --> 59:09.842
The image of a book collector.

59:10.565 --> 59:25.079
One of the things that would astound people that I would write or speak with on the phone is that when we would meet in person, they were amazed that I was as young as I was, that I had as much energy, that I was as seemingly virile as it were.

59:25.379 --> 59:38.091
It was very peculiar to me to meet people who would have naturally assumed, I found out, that I was an old man, that I was cigar-smoking, that I was pot-bellied, that I was effeminate.

59:38.780 --> 59:49.326
For some reason, book collectors seem to have created an image for themselves in the public eye that is one of effeminacy quite often.

59:49.366 --> 59:50.349
That may have changed.

59:50.369 --> 59:55.000
I was quite often astounded, as I said, to find that I was

59:56.245 --> 59:58.709
presenting a different image than the one they anticipated finding.

59:58.729 --> 01:00:00.452
Book collecting is endemic now.

01:00:00.672 --> 01:00:01.834
It is now.

01:00:02.335 --> 01:00:18.582
I think that I never was the kind of book collector that one might think of as being ascetic, sedentary, how else, sort of slight, if you will, either that or the other one, the other end of it, whatever.

01:00:18.603 --> 01:00:19.504
Reticence.

01:00:19.564 --> 01:00:20.065
Reticence.

01:00:20.225 --> 01:00:21.427
I was very aggressive.

01:00:21.507 --> 01:00:22.489
I was very out.

01:00:22.823 --> 01:00:27.033
Sort of a milk toast.

01:00:27.053 --> 01:00:28.837
Yes, and I never was that.

01:00:28.857 --> 01:00:33.408
And I'll tell you what, I didn't find book collecting to excite me that way.

01:00:33.448 --> 01:00:35.873
That would be the person who worked in the catalogs again.

01:00:36.394 --> 01:00:38.399
Someone who really never ventured out.

01:00:38.419 --> 01:00:40.123
For me, the adventure of collecting

01:00:40.289 --> 01:00:41.552
was the venturing hour.

01:00:41.752 --> 01:00:43.435
Now that's a nice quote.

01:00:44.157 --> 01:00:47.083
And for me, collecting had to be dynamic.

01:00:47.364 --> 01:00:50.771
It had to be an interaction between people.

01:00:50.791 --> 01:00:57.825
Throughout these hours of tapes, I've told you a number of the people that I visited, but the visits were what made the collecting worthwhile.

01:00:58.126 --> 01:01:06.146
Knowing Victoria Johnson, knowing Malcolm Cowley, having Malcolm offered to edit my book, Mississippi Vistas, things of that nature.

01:01:06.166 --> 01:01:12.743
Having Cleant Brooks endorse my books over the years because he respected me as a poet as well as a Faulknerian.
