00:02.427 --> 00:06.532
This is Dr. Robert and Jeremy Jones.

00:06.832 --> 00:10.517
Do you use the middle initial, don't you ask?

00:10.537 --> 00:10.777
No.

00:11.078 --> 00:13.020
What's your title here?

00:13.040 --> 00:28.699
Well, I run the Near and Middle East Department, otherwise known as the Islamic Department, which specializes in books, European books, about the Middle East from as early as we can go to the early 20th century.

00:29.180 --> 00:31.843
So the formation of states in

00:32.144 --> 00:43.014
in Arabia and the Arabian Gulf region relating to the modern period.

00:43.314 --> 00:51.802
And we also handle documents relating to the Middle East, for example.

00:52.803 --> 00:59.029
We've recently handled early 15th century Venetian letters, quite a big collection of them.

00:59.482 --> 01:12.740
sent by Venetian merchants in the Levant to each other in different parts of the Levant or to colleagues and family in Venice.

01:13.240 --> 01:22.412
We've also recently handled quite a large collection of what are known as Turkica, so 16th century pamphlets.

01:23.053 --> 01:23.794
How would you spell that?

01:23.874 --> 01:28.240
Turkica, T-U-R-C-I-C-A, Turkica.

01:29.215 --> 01:58.682
which are ephemeral items in that they were published as a result of Turkish incursions into Central Europe, mainly in Germany and in Italy, so you find there are Roman prints, Venetian imprints, and publications from various parts of Germany, a bit in France, but relating the tale of the

01:58.882 --> 02:01.865
Turks as they came westwards.

02:02.446 --> 02:05.870
You said that you came here 13 years ago?

02:05.890 --> 02:06.971
13, yeah.

02:07.311 --> 02:09.754
Was this straight out of graduate school?

02:09.774 --> 02:12.057
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:12.257 --> 02:22.428
And I was delighted to find there was something other than academic pursuits related to my specialist knowledge.

02:22.588 --> 02:25.511
Before I had the machine, you had indicated that you studied at Durham?

02:26.032 --> 02:27.514
Durham, Isfahan.

02:27.914 --> 02:28.855
In Iran.

02:29.324 --> 02:35.710
the Warburg Institute in London University, and SOAS, which is the School of Oriental and African Studies.

02:36.671 --> 02:40.235
And the intention all along was to be a researcher?

02:40.375 --> 02:42.757
No, particularly I just followed my interests.

02:42.958 --> 02:47.382
I didn't have a clear interest in particularly taking on an academic job.

02:47.442 --> 02:50.265
If anything, I look for something else.

02:51.166 --> 02:53.228
So I'm a bit of a maverick.

02:54.769 --> 02:58.453
I still do lecture when asked.

02:59.058 --> 03:02.123
So the academic interest persists.

03:02.183 --> 03:11.256
I'm just finishing a book now on Renaissance Arabic studies in Europe, which will be out later this year.

03:11.336 --> 03:12.879
Will that be published here in the U.J.?

03:12.899 --> 03:14.922
It will be published in Holland by E.J.

03:14.942 --> 03:17.345
Brill, your interest.

03:17.866 --> 03:27.040
It's called Learning Arabic in Renaissance Europe, and it's the study of how people acquired manuscripts and text.

03:28.150 --> 03:29.872
That's fascinating.

03:29.892 --> 03:34.757
How the people they met, the Arabic speakers they met.

03:35.277 --> 03:45.768
And there's quite a technical section on grammar and how you write an Arabic grammar book in Europe in 1580.

03:46.789 --> 03:53.115
So it's quite a hot subject, actually, since I did the research for that.

03:53.515 --> 03:56.098
There's been one or two, like a book, so...

03:56.332 --> 03:58.115
What specifically is the subject?

03:58.175 --> 04:01.480
The subject that you're writing on, or Arabic studies in general?

04:01.720 --> 04:06.167
No, specifically 16th and early 17th century in Europe.

04:06.187 --> 04:12.477
So it's the birth of Orientalism, a subject which has been banded around a lot.

04:12.497 --> 04:22.693
Do you find that with this renaissance of interest, that the interest in the books, that the value of these books, is there a relation between what you do

04:23.163 --> 04:25.486
Well, it's a pretty esoteric interest.

04:26.548 --> 04:48.377
I mean, I remember the first time I went to the Gulf, I arrived in Kuwait in the second half of the 80s, and I was amazed to find somebody there at home who had a very nice lot of reference books, including some pretty important

04:49.285 --> 04:53.850
bibliographical guides to Arabic, early Arabic printing.

04:54.051 --> 04:57.495
And we sort of sat and consulted and discussed all these things.

04:58.596 --> 05:02.761
So, you know, but that kind of interest is very rare.

05:04.443 --> 05:10.049
About 18 months ago, I went to Dubai for a conference on the history of Arabic printing.

05:10.069 --> 05:15.996
But that was sort of printing in the Arab world as well as in Europe.

05:16.016 --> 05:19.140
I'm not sure that it necessarily alters the

05:20.032 --> 05:26.040
But the whole value of Middle Eastern books has risen, honestly, in the last 10 years.

05:26.060 --> 05:26.661
I've witnessed it.

05:27.161 --> 05:30.966
Now, you came to work here in 84, approximately?

05:30.986 --> 05:31.407
Yeah.

05:31.427 --> 05:33.109
Did this create a new department here?

05:33.549 --> 05:34.691
Yeah.

05:34.791 --> 05:46.326
So there must have been some perception there that this is an area that the company had to... It's always been something that Quaridge has handled, right from the very first catalogue, actually.

05:46.998 --> 05:50.401
you'll find material in one way or another relates to the Middle East.

05:51.302 --> 06:00.109
And he was handling quite a lot of manuscript material early on that Paul Crawford was buying.

06:00.250 --> 06:07.616
In the 20th century, Chester Beatty was a great customer of ours, and many of the good number.

06:07.656 --> 06:15.823
Chester Beatty, whose collection is in Dublin now, was acquiring a good deal of

06:16.225 --> 06:21.811
Arabic manuscript and version manuscript material and miniatures from Quaritch at that time.

06:24.194 --> 06:35.306
But in the last, the John Rylands Library actually has quite a holding of Arabic manuscripts that came via the Crawford collection.

06:36.248 --> 06:41.153
But back from Quaritch, no.

06:41.943 --> 06:44.226
It's always been a tradition, but there wasn't a specialist.

06:44.246 --> 06:45.628
There were specialists at that time.

06:45.668 --> 06:55.862
There was somebody in particular, John Kearney, who read these various languages and cataloged this material for Lord Crawford as well.

06:56.102 --> 06:58.325
But there hasn't been a specialist in the subject.

06:58.345 --> 07:03.011
I mean, it has got much more specialized sort of travel.

07:03.933 --> 07:11.663
Do you find, I think you suggested, you implied earlier that you really deal with collections and not individual homes?

07:11.930 --> 07:25.827
I tend to, but that's, you know, because, you know, it's just been the way that I've developed the particular time base that I have.

07:26.508 --> 07:28.330
But it doesn't have to be that way.

07:28.430 --> 07:33.977
I mean, there are plenty of Middle East booksellers who produce lists of books.

07:34.057 --> 07:37.802
But would you say then that these are the kinds of collections that are

07:38.609 --> 07:41.151
especially valuable for their research?

07:41.812 --> 07:43.053
It could be for research.

07:43.153 --> 07:47.177
They could be more sort of for ornament.

07:48.618 --> 07:51.401
I mean, there are some fabulous illustrating books.

07:53.423 --> 07:59.068
There's a whole range of reasons why anybody would want to acquire books on the region.

07:59.228 --> 08:06.034
I mean, some people are purely interested in research aspects, others are interested for a more aesthetic point of view.

08:06.284 --> 08:23.902
But do you find that with the increased interest in recent years in that region, for any number of reasons that we all know about, do you find that institutional libraries are keen on enhancing their collections?

08:25.203 --> 08:32.511
I think, well, if you're talking about the Middle East, that was a big thing in the 70s, say, in the Arab world.

08:32.710 --> 08:40.723
with the rise of these oil powers and their revenues, particularly after about 1973.

08:43.187 --> 08:48.114
But I think it was sort of imitative of Western institutions.

08:48.174 --> 08:53.463
It wasn't really something that they had a very good grip on at that time.

08:54.224 --> 08:59.292
And so quite big purchases were made in that period.

08:59.795 --> 09:05.304
by institutions, but I wouldn't say that's been followed up since in a very aggressive way.

09:06.506 --> 09:16.644
And now I think you find the good deal more discernment 20 years on, 25 years on.

09:16.664 --> 09:23.175
So I haven't noticed really a sort of very strong institutional interest there.

09:23.195 --> 09:24.537
I mean, it's there, but it's not

09:25.715 --> 09:27.757
It's not as active as I'd like it to be.

09:27.777 --> 09:28.538
No kidding.

09:28.818 --> 09:40.130
In America, again, I think, you know, the pattern of Middle Eastern purchases has been tended to be, particularly with manuscripts, collections.

09:40.310 --> 09:47.437
Again, a collection at Princeton, a collection at Chicago, a collection at UCLA.

09:47.457 --> 09:50.060
I mean, all of these are sort of one-off collections.

09:50.100 --> 09:52.482
I'm not aware of a sort of

09:53.423 --> 10:03.520
for the pattern of acquisitions in that field, and the same in this country, in Europe.

10:05.063 --> 10:12.535
It's not, you know, Cambridge University or whatever, in the Welcome Library here.

10:14.078 --> 10:19.026
There's not really, I wouldn't say that the institutional

10:19.580 --> 10:23.265
But that may be my perception.

10:23.625 --> 10:30.455
I'm sure it's my perception, and it's because I haven't particularly pursued that market.

10:30.475 --> 10:45.375
Now, with this collection that we have here, this rather extensive library that I guess has been consigned, the logical place for that to be, I would think, would be a university library.

10:45.555 --> 10:46.937
Yeah, yeah, maybe.

10:47.913 --> 10:54.203
I'm not really in a position to discuss that collection at the moment because it's in the process of being marketed.

10:54.223 --> 11:00.172
Is it the kind of thing that you do a catalogue of?

11:01.274 --> 11:03.237
Not a published catalogue.

11:03.257 --> 11:06.141
It's a private placement.

11:06.161 --> 11:12.351
So without discussing that collection at all, how do you go about marketing something like that?

11:12.753 --> 11:15.637
You don't publish a catalog and you don't advertise it.

11:15.677 --> 11:23.586
You know, we've built up a whole network of contacts over the years and just pursue those people.

11:24.468 --> 11:31.376
But, I mean, it's not like an auction house saying, okay, everybody turn up on such and such a date.

11:32.397 --> 11:38.565
It's actually just pursuing the individuals that we know to bear attention.

11:38.625 --> 11:42.490
What makes it very interesting to me as well is the fact that

11:43.803 --> 11:46.006
Apparently you have the mandate to sell on a block.

11:47.247 --> 11:52.413
We're not in a position to discuss it, you see.

11:52.514 --> 11:53.495
I'm sorry.

11:53.515 --> 12:01.445
I mean, this can happen until we get a mandate to sell something on behalf of somebody.

12:03.147 --> 12:11.717
But, I mean, that's perfectly normal way to pursue it.

12:13.216 --> 12:18.142
There are collections, generic collections, that are worth more as collections.

12:19.764 --> 12:29.595
I suppose there's a little premium involved in the effort that somebody's put into performing a collection, and that can be dissipated by breaking up the collection.

12:31.878 --> 12:38.245
But by the same token, anybody who's buying is obviously going to like it.

12:38.748 --> 12:44.154
some sort of deal in the fact that they're acquiring a totality rather than a few odd books.

12:44.675 --> 12:45.495
Books both ways.

12:45.936 --> 12:49.340
Well, of course, once they have it, they can do whatever they want with that, too.

12:49.400 --> 12:50.221
Yeah.

12:50.241 --> 13:01.613
Can you think of anything to ask Dr. James?

13:01.633 --> 13:04.757
Yeah, it was quite impressive.

13:07.660 --> 13:08.721
Quite, quite magnificent.

13:09.612 --> 13:12.194
I'm going to give you my card, okay?

13:12.295 --> 13:25.947
I didn't know that we'd be talking, so I have to... Two manuscripts in the Bodleian were acquired in Central Europe after battles with the Turks.

13:26.948 --> 13:30.612
In fact, there were a couple of quite interesting cases of Qurans.

13:31.753 --> 13:37.138
See, because they had a kind of talismanic power and were carried on journeys and into battle,

13:37.777 --> 13:46.970
And so if a tarrant was captured or after a battle there was booty to be had.

13:47.732 --> 14:04.476
Funnily enough, these Qurans attracted a tremendous amount of interest among scholars and eventually found their way back to the courts and to the scholars who wanted to read the Qurans for one

14:04.895 --> 14:10.382
very essential reason, that is because it's the only Arabic text which is consistently vocalized.

14:11.383 --> 14:22.096
Because most Arabic is written in an outline, like shorthand, and you can't really read it unless you've got the vowels there, or you know the grammar very well.

14:22.276 --> 14:30.987
Because they didn't know any grammar, the only kind of piece of Arabic they could read would be a Quran where all the vowels are written in.

14:31.743 --> 14:33.525
You know, it's an irony.

14:33.685 --> 14:34.847
Oh, go ahead.

14:34.927 --> 14:35.447
It's an irony.

14:35.868 --> 14:41.334
And all these manuscripts ended up in... I'll send you a copy of the article.

14:41.375 --> 14:44.799
I'll just ask where I can get it, because this is what we're writing about.

14:45.039 --> 14:49.384
Again, it's... I'll send you this, because you may never get a story out of it.

14:49.544 --> 14:51.106
It's quite an exciting story.

14:51.146 --> 14:53.569
It's a little kind of a nugget that I'm looking for.

14:53.729 --> 14:54.530
I like that.

14:54.590 --> 14:58.375
And could you send... Do you have a little CV on yourself that you could send along, too?

14:58.395 --> 14:58.555
Yeah.

14:59.116 --> 15:00.197
You won't forget now.

15:00.683 --> 15:03.187
I'd like to know how it's going to be put to use.

15:03.327 --> 15:04.028
Okay.

15:04.308 --> 15:05.430
That's fair.

15:05.630 --> 15:08.514
We're still a full two years away.

15:08.834 --> 15:10.477
I haven't even started writing yet.

15:10.497 --> 15:17.306
The projected date of publication is Fall 99, on the eve of the new millennium, you see.

15:17.367 --> 15:24.777
So it's... I mean, the subtitle is Book People, Book Places, and Book Culture on the Eve of the New Millennium.

15:24.857 --> 15:30.505
And the title is from Milton, Life Beyond Life, from the famous quote in the

15:30.856 --> 15:35.482
The precious lifeblood of the master spirit being books.

15:35.502 --> 15:39.247
Preserved and served up unto a life beyond life, I think.

15:40.269 --> 15:43.172
Don't hold me to the literal truth.

15:44.434 --> 15:49.561
But that's just a very... You might get something... Piracy?

15:50.122 --> 15:52.064
Oh, it was Paris.

15:52.285 --> 15:53.366
Sorry, what were you asking?

15:53.386 --> 15:56.751
You said it was piracy or... Piracy, yeah, piracy.

15:56.771 --> 15:57.792
No, piracy, piracy.

15:58.396 --> 16:00.359
As in... Boats.

16:00.379 --> 16:01.360
As in Blackbeard.

16:02.922 --> 16:03.683
Pugwash.

16:04.564 --> 16:06.947
Maybe he's not an American.

16:07.027 --> 16:08.189
Pugwash.

16:08.849 --> 16:09.530
Or Blackbeard.

16:09.650 --> 16:12.835
They just found his flagship off the coast of North Carolina.

16:13.355 --> 16:14.256
I saw that.

16:15.979 --> 16:19.022
Well, I think this was impromptu.

16:19.503 --> 16:20.905
Let's really thank you.

16:22.367 --> 16:23.889
I'll give you a comment.

16:24.009 --> 16:24.329
Would you?

16:24.349 --> 16:24.910
That'd be great.

16:25.177 --> 16:53.749
and then the main major national libraries have incredible collections I mean that's one of the extraordinary things is that these major libraries in Europe have incredible Middle East collections and it's due to the collecting of manuscripts in the West from 15th century onwards and relations with the Christian Arabic churches in the Levant

16:54.708 --> 17:08.824
the interest in the Ottoman world, all sorts of reasons, and an intellectual interest in Islam, combating Islam from that day.

17:08.884 --> 17:13.249
You have to understand and read the Quran in order to refute it, you see.

17:13.269 --> 17:19.717
And people are realizing that you can't just hold up, stem the tide of Islam by the sword.

17:20.478 --> 17:22.420
You need to be able to argue the case.

17:22.703 --> 17:27.788
And for that they needed sources that they could understand them.

17:27.808 --> 17:34.955
And you find incredible treasures in Western libraries that came into our libraries from that time.

17:35.015 --> 17:36.797
And it stems precisely from that?

17:36.857 --> 17:39.520
From a conflict.

17:39.540 --> 17:39.900
Yeah.

17:41.101 --> 17:44.164
And do you document any of these?

17:44.205 --> 17:45.005
Yeah, I do.

17:45.085 --> 17:48.148
And I document the particular manuscripts.

17:48.209 --> 17:49.690
I mean, there are some quite magnificent manuscripts.

17:49.889 --> 17:50.870
in this article here?

17:50.890 --> 17:51.070
Yeah.

17:51.090 --> 17:52.933
Oh, you must read this article.

17:53.213 --> 17:55.716
That's what I'm looking for.

17:56.256 --> 17:58.859
And this book that you're publishing?

17:59.420 --> 18:08.050
Well, that will come out in a while, and that's really, it's quite technical, actually.

18:08.070 --> 18:09.232
There are some other stories.

18:12.095 --> 18:17.962
But I... I hope it'll be out there.

18:17.982 --> 18:19.103
I think you'll find some

18:19.707 --> 18:21.431
I read at Harvard.

18:21.471 --> 18:23.094
They get everything there, which is great.

18:23.154 --> 18:27.323
So I'll do a run on your name, and I'm sure all sorts of things will pop up.

18:27.343 --> 18:38.606
Any other articles that you've done that... I think that would be probably one that would... Yeah, but there are... If you run across there, you won't skimp.

18:38.626 --> 18:39.808
Send it along.

18:40.025 --> 18:43.530
I'll be happy, you know, to go over whatever quotes I use.

18:44.712 --> 18:52.624
I would appreciate that, actually, because it is very new material and relatively new.

18:52.644 --> 18:56.270
And it probably hasn't had the urine that it should do.

18:56.290 --> 18:58.854
I think it is becoming a subject.

19:00.196 --> 19:03.181
If you look at my other book, everything I use is fully cited.

19:04.302 --> 19:06.606
Everyone is given proper credit for...

19:07.497 --> 19:14.954
for their contributions, because I do pride myself in doing a very nice bibliography and a good textual apparatus.

19:14.974 --> 19:17.380
Well, I'm looking forward to seeing you.

19:17.621 --> 19:17.761
Good.

19:18.563 --> 19:19.826
Thanks a lot for your time.

19:19.846 --> 19:20.427
I'm sorry.
