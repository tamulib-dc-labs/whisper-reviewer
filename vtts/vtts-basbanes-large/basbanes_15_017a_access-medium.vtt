00:01.735 --> 00:11.505
talking to Jonathan Haar, H-A-R-R, as opposed to H-E-R-R on this morning's USA Today.

00:13.066 --> 00:14.328
Just enter the conversation.

00:14.428 --> 00:22.656
I was saying it's a different style of nonfiction that's practiced by a few friends of mine, actually, Tracy Kidder.

00:23.097 --> 00:24.598
Who I've interviewed a couple times.

00:24.738 --> 00:26.880
I'll give him my best if he remembers me.

00:26.900 --> 00:27.601
I certainly will.

00:28.242 --> 00:30.544
He's a very good friend, and he really helped me out.

00:30.811 --> 00:34.955
But some people end up taking exception to this, which is narrative stuff.

00:34.975 --> 00:36.998
You try and tell a story.

00:37.518 --> 00:48.710
For me, the most elemental thing in reading is telling a story, is making people turn the page to find out what happened next.

00:48.730 --> 00:50.492
That was a threshold for me, by the way.

00:50.732 --> 00:59.822
I mean, there are any number of fascinating book stories out there that are interesting or valid, but they had to be good stories to get in.

01:00.967 --> 01:04.371
which is why Paul Mellon was boring and didn't get in.

01:04.391 --> 01:06.914
But I think that's what you're saying.

01:06.934 --> 01:11.999
But Tracy, from what I've read, actually suggested this to you, this subject.

01:12.019 --> 01:12.360
Is that right?

01:12.380 --> 01:12.680
He did.

01:12.820 --> 01:14.202
Someone suggested it to him.

01:15.063 --> 01:18.126
That actually is like a Tracy Kenner kind of story.

01:18.927 --> 01:22.671
I was writing for New England Monthly and doing this kind of thing.

01:22.691 --> 01:25.995
I did it half a dozen times.

01:26.195 --> 01:28.037
And my favorite, I think, you know,

01:28.557 --> 01:29.698
I had met C.D.B.

01:29.759 --> 01:34.565
Bryan in 1976, just after Friendly Fire came out.

01:35.246 --> 01:37.048
I was immensely impressed with that book.

01:37.669 --> 01:39.792
And, you know, the origins of it are pretty clear.

01:39.832 --> 01:52.588
It's like Truman Capote in Cold Blood, Tom Wolfe's book, which no one can hope to emulate the right stuff because it's got such an idiosyncratic writing style.

01:52.608 --> 01:53.610
But C.D.B.

01:53.630 --> 01:57.855
Bryan and John McPhee and Tracy...

01:59.320 --> 02:01.563
Executioner's Song by Mailer.

02:01.603 --> 02:02.385
Mailer.

02:02.465 --> 02:04.007
I think it's the best one.

02:04.027 --> 02:05.048
I love the right stuff.

02:05.209 --> 02:07.592
I remember interviewing Tom Wolfe.

02:07.913 --> 02:11.258
I spent three years in an aircraft carrier back in the 60s.

02:11.278 --> 02:13.301
And I remember saying, geez, you've got this carrier down.

02:13.321 --> 02:16.165
I mean, you've got this, the ward room.

02:16.185 --> 02:18.508
So I said, you know, which one did you visit?

02:18.809 --> 02:21.032
He said, I've never seen an aircraft carrier in my life.

02:21.392 --> 02:22.154
I said, geez.

02:22.294 --> 02:23.496
I said, are you serious?

02:23.516 --> 02:24.577
I mean, phone calls.

02:24.617 --> 02:27.201
He made some phone calls to describe the ward room for me.

02:27.502 --> 02:32.828
I remember his story that appeared in Esquire, and it wasn't in the right stuff.

02:32.848 --> 02:33.489
It didn't come out.

02:33.549 --> 02:33.709
No.

02:33.769 --> 02:39.416
But it was about a plane landing on an aircraft carrier, and basically three tons of metal crashing is what it was all about.

02:39.636 --> 02:41.258
It was the most amazing piece of writing.

02:41.278 --> 02:42.159
Yeah, but he'd never seen it.

02:42.600 --> 02:43.861
And that's extraordinary.

02:43.881 --> 02:44.922
Yeah, he'd never seen it.

02:45.123 --> 02:48.466
And I've seen it like 10,000 times, and I'm not exaggerating the number.

02:48.947 --> 02:51.750
I just saw 1,000 a day, 100 a day, about.

02:51.770 --> 02:54.133
1,000 a week, some weeks, you know.

02:54.552 --> 02:57.976
And I said, well, he's really got this carious stuff down.

02:58.017 --> 02:58.938
Never seen one.

03:00.159 --> 03:03.904
Called some people, and of course the people who interviewed him, but I'm sorry to go off the track.

03:03.944 --> 03:09.231
So these are your spiritual... Yeah, that's my origins.

03:11.254 --> 03:17.823
But, well, you can either talk about the style of writing or how I got the book.

03:17.843 --> 03:19.244
Well, either way.

03:19.264 --> 03:22.028
I'll tell you the way... Discursive interviews are fine with me.

03:22.582 --> 03:23.383
I'll tell you the way.

03:23.843 --> 03:25.746
You like tape recorders.

03:25.766 --> 03:28.549
I've never used one because they baffle me.

03:28.569 --> 03:30.731
And I always end up getting so much stuff.

03:30.751 --> 03:33.014
A few times I have tried to use it.

03:33.034 --> 03:36.698
I end up getting so much stuff that it's so laborious to transcribe.

03:36.758 --> 03:42.705
I would have thought in a book like this that you'd really want to have the stuff.

03:42.725 --> 03:43.846
You know, take notes.

03:44.446 --> 03:50.293
I take notes, but... There's a few scenes like...

03:50.780 --> 03:56.147
You know, the Helmsley Palace scene, when they go down to New York to negotiate with W.R.

03:56.207 --> 03:58.951
Grace, in which there's a lot of dialogue going on.

03:59.952 --> 04:02.115
It occupies maybe three pages of the book.

04:02.816 --> 04:09.866
And, you know, people may wonder where I got this stuff.

04:09.886 --> 04:11.368
One answer is I was privy to it.

04:12.049 --> 04:15.353
But the other thing is that the conversation went on for three hours.

04:15.907 --> 04:21.774
And as in most conversations, there's an enormous amount of repetition and digression and so on.

04:21.794 --> 04:30.264
I took a lot of notes, and I don't pretend that I got down every single word they said, but I got down, and then I had to redact to compress.

04:30.544 --> 04:38.033
As a practical matter, when I transcribe this tape, and I go to write the story,

04:39.262 --> 04:47.176
If you don't have a verb agreeing with a noun, it'll agree with the noun in between the quotations.

04:47.276 --> 04:50.923
I've never, I've done it close to a thousand authors, I've never had one complaint.

04:52.425 --> 04:57.294
I mean, I think it's understood that... And that's true, too.

04:57.314 --> 05:00.139
A lot of stuff I took out of transcripts,

05:00.710 --> 05:03.493
because they're the best note-takers in the world.

05:03.633 --> 05:06.936
You know, the way people speak, they don't speak in complete sentences.

05:06.996 --> 05:08.057
They speak in fragments.

05:08.238 --> 05:14.264
It's amazing when you actually encounter somebody who does... Some politicians.

05:14.864 --> 05:15.745
Many politicians.

05:15.765 --> 05:19.729
Somebody like Leonard Baskin on your neck of the woods, who's in my book.

05:19.809 --> 05:24.834
He absolutely talks in wonderful, complete sentences.

05:24.854 --> 05:30.700
I mean, you'd swear that the thing was edited in my book, but he actually said that he sees it.

05:31.338 --> 05:33.582
Of course, he said he's a printer, too.

05:33.662 --> 05:37.027
Gary sees it visually, which is interesting.

05:37.929 --> 05:42.055
I guess you were an author in search of a book at this particular time in your life.

05:42.295 --> 05:44.659
What happened was, yeah, that's exactly so.

05:44.699 --> 05:46.081
I was working at New England Monthly.

05:46.302 --> 05:52.572
I'd been there for two and a half years, and I was the first person hired to write for them.

05:52.592 --> 05:56.338
I'd had an editing job before that, for a weekly newspaper, and I didn't like editing.

05:56.839 --> 05:58.341
I went to New England Monthly to write.

05:58.793 --> 06:03.638
And I became good friends with Tracy, who was right down the road from New England Monthly.

06:03.658 --> 06:06.100
And he knew I was looking for a book.

06:06.821 --> 06:08.342
He had just finished writing House.

06:09.083 --> 06:19.514
And he got a call from a friend of Charlie Nesson's, who was the Harvard Law Professor in the book.

06:19.534 --> 06:20.835
Nesson was playing poker.

06:21.516 --> 06:23.197
I played poker every Wednesday night.

06:23.458 --> 06:26.961
And one of the guys around the poker table knew

06:27.616 --> 06:29.138
both Ness and Kidder.

06:29.618 --> 06:36.647
And Nesson came to the poker table having just joined the lawsuit and started talking about him, very excited about what an incredible case this was.

06:38.008 --> 06:42.453
And this guy said, maybe Tracy would be interested in writing about it.

06:42.473 --> 06:46.418
And Charlie thought that was just great.

06:46.438 --> 06:49.922
Interesting it came from that side of the case, though, isn't it?

06:49.942 --> 06:54.367
Yeah, the plaintiff's side of the case, yeah.

06:54.387 --> 06:57.471
I can't imagine it coming from the corporate side, the defendant's side.

06:58.295 --> 07:01.118
And Charlie isn't your traditional kind of lawyer.

07:01.478 --> 07:05.762
I don't know— That's why, of course, it behooves them.

07:05.782 --> 07:06.943
Right, they want to get the word out.

07:07.083 --> 07:08.685
Right, right.

07:10.747 --> 07:17.353
And Tracy had just finished House, and he was doing his book tour, or just done with it, and wanted to take some time off.

07:17.453 --> 07:22.758
I think I interviewed him on House.

07:22.778 --> 07:26.682
You ran the risk, obviously, of, if not

07:27.691 --> 07:31.875
taking sides, but being presumed to be an advocate.

07:32.035 --> 07:35.619
And how do you respond to that, and how do you feel about it?

07:36.600 --> 07:47.250
Well, I think the book is, you know, Schlickman is no unharnished hero in this book.

07:47.310 --> 07:49.032
No, I have a question to ask you at some point.

07:49.052 --> 07:51.314
Do you see him as a tragic hero at some point?

07:51.334 --> 07:52.635
There's a lot of hubris there.

07:52.695 --> 07:55.358
I mean, there really is great tragedy in a way.

07:56.319 --> 07:57.360
You know, my sense was,

07:57.661 --> 08:06.133
And there's some of the plaintiff's expert witnesses that don't come off so well, because I simply didn't believe their testimony.

08:06.153 --> 08:13.283
Schlittman has a very, very difficult time during the course of trial with one particular expert witness, George Pinder, the hydrogeologist.

08:13.984 --> 08:21.034
And I was essentially, I wanted to write what I saw, good, bad, or indifferent.

08:21.054 --> 08:27.583
Now, having spent as much time as I did with the plaintiffs, you'd think that my sympathy would naturally lie in that direction.

08:27.901 --> 08:31.124
But it seemed on the face of it that they had a legitimate taste.

08:31.144 --> 08:32.305
This was not spurious.

08:32.866 --> 08:38.911
I mean, Grace, it was clear Grace had dumped stuff on the ground and the Beatrice property was contaminated.

08:39.412 --> 08:45.718
It was clear that the wells were contaminated with the same stuff that was on the Grace property and the Beatrice property.

08:46.739 --> 08:52.584
And it was clear that there was an epidemic or at least a cluster of leukemia.

08:52.885 --> 08:54.126
The CDC said so.

08:54.146 --> 08:56.288
So I entered this case, you know,

08:56.977 --> 09:04.987
I entered writing it thinking that there is some legitimate cause here that I'd like to explore.

09:05.007 --> 09:10.754
Well, were you going in to examine a cause, or was this going to be the quintessential civil case?

09:11.715 --> 09:13.257
You know, neither one, to be honest.

09:13.337 --> 09:16.981
I didn't go in dying to write about judicial reform.

09:17.081 --> 09:20.866
This wasn't the soul of a civil case, so to speak.

09:21.247 --> 09:23.049
I think it turned out that way.

09:23.269 --> 09:25.752
I like what...

09:26.272 --> 09:32.119
Polonius says in Hamlet, by indirection, find directions out.

09:32.139 --> 09:37.406
What I wanted to write was a story about people engaged in a major endeavor.

09:38.046 --> 09:39.809
And I had wanted to write about lawyers.

09:41.531 --> 09:48.459
In the mid-'80s, if you remember, insurance reform was a very hard thing.

09:48.960 --> 09:51.503
The thing with machines is you do have to constantly—

09:52.242 --> 09:59.529
In the mid-'80s, insurance reform was a big deal, and everybody's talking about medical malpractice driving the cost of medicine.

10:00.129 --> 10:02.492
And that issue interested me quite a bit.

10:02.612 --> 10:08.197
What I had hoped to do was explore, find a case which was a traditional medical malpractice case.

10:09.138 --> 10:17.746
You know, one person injured in the hospital, and typically those cases last two to three weeks in trial, if they go to trial, if they don't settle first.

10:18.747 --> 10:21.169
Which happens what percentage of the time?

10:21.385 --> 10:22.627
Most of the time, doesn't it?

10:23.008 --> 10:26.394
They settle about 95% of the time, yeah.

10:26.414 --> 10:33.085
But I thought I would find one that didn't settle, or find a firm that I could hang around and watch them bring cases.

10:34.047 --> 10:38.895
You know, the ones that go to trial are interesting simply because of that kind of courtroom drama.

10:38.915 --> 10:46.228
But in fact, if real life is 95% of them settle, then that's something worth exploring too.

10:47.170 --> 11:02.786
So, I had that in the back of my mind when I entered this, but I didn't—I was interested in writing about lawyers, because the law seems to be, you know, the fundament of the society, any urban industrial society.

11:05.248 --> 11:08.872
The risk, of course, is you have no idea how it's going to turn out.

11:08.892 --> 11:09.473
How it's going to turn out.

11:09.493 --> 11:14.578
Especially once you're into it a number of years.

11:15.605 --> 11:21.471
not only in material investment, but your time and your energy and everything.

11:22.932 --> 11:23.373
That's right.

11:23.773 --> 11:32.963
And it didn't quite end out the way maybe you'd have, for dramatic purposes, might have been, but of course it ended the way it ended as well.

11:33.263 --> 11:39.109
It ended the way it ended, and the task was making a story out of the way it ended.

11:39.149 --> 11:43.013
I was actually quite disappointed that it didn't get to the second phase of the medical

11:44.191 --> 11:46.594
me, was the most critically interesting stuff.

11:47.475 --> 11:55.964
And by the way, the least certain, I mean, to me it was very clear that Grace and Beatrice were responsible for the contamination of the wells.

11:55.984 --> 11:59.347
Whether the stuff actually caused leukemia is yet another matter.

11:59.728 --> 12:03.672
You know, the New York Times guy, Bernstein, took me to task of it for that.

12:04.213 --> 12:05.794
But I never said it did.

12:05.814 --> 12:06.515
I think you may have.

12:08.137 --> 12:09.839
Oh, it's fine.

12:09.859 --> 12:10.439
This is good.

12:10.459 --> 12:12.882
This is a really good change.

12:13.503 --> 12:16.647
So I was disappointed.

12:17.808 --> 12:19.430
As long as the red light is on, it's fine.

12:19.911 --> 12:21.132
I'll let you know when it goes on.

12:21.152 --> 12:23.635
No, I just changed the batteries outside.

12:23.655 --> 12:27.600
Well, does it make a sound when it completely spools out?

12:27.620 --> 12:28.501
Yeah, but I know.

12:28.621 --> 12:31.705
I've got an internal clock to whatever it does.

12:31.805 --> 12:32.766
Go ahead.

12:33.728 --> 12:37.452
I was disappointed when the verdict came back.

12:37.769 --> 12:40.413
because I knew that it was very bad.

12:40.433 --> 12:43.679
It made it very difficult for Schlickman to go on.

12:44.800 --> 12:54.376
But then what ensued immediately after that was this amazing six weeks of negotiation with Beatrice, I mean with Grace, who was found liable.

12:54.937 --> 12:57.481
And I followed that, and I had complete access.

12:57.581 --> 12:59.244
I mean, I was with these guys in New York.

12:59.304 --> 13:03.591
I was with them in their conference room when they were talking about what the hell they were going to do next.

13:03.993 --> 13:10.622
I was with Schlickman in his office, you know, listening on the telephone, listening to him talk on the telephone to the other side.

13:11.082 --> 13:24.360
So I knew that I had a hell of a good drama, even if the case didn't pan out the way, you know, didn't reach a verdict that would have been kind of easier to write about.

13:24.981 --> 13:28.966
You don't want to write about a loss, in essence.

13:28.986 --> 13:31.249
So you did kind of have a...

13:32.090 --> 13:34.652
a vested interest in how it turned out.

13:34.792 --> 13:38.415
Well, as you point out... From a writer's point of view.

13:38.435 --> 13:38.576
Yeah.

13:38.636 --> 13:43.540
Not necessarily from, you know, who you might be yourself rooting for.

13:43.680 --> 13:45.381
Yeah, it's true.

13:45.822 --> 13:57.532
As you point out, you enter these things not knowing where it's going to go, but you hope that the arc of it takes a shape that is suitable for dramatic purposes, you know, that it's interesting.

13:59.834 --> 14:01.135
The ensuing four years,

14:01.638 --> 14:08.964
in which he appealed and essentially his self-destruction was then quite fascinating to me as I watched that.

14:10.346 --> 14:12.327
I had no idea where that was going to go.

14:13.368 --> 14:27.681
Having no idea where things are going to go, at what point did you decide that this story could go on forever and that it's time really to write and to formulate this?

14:28.061 --> 14:29.923
There was a problem.

14:30.258 --> 14:45.973
When I first, when the verdict came in and I'd done much of the reporting up for the first, it was essentially eight months, up through the fall of 86, I wrote a proposal then, and my agent took it to Random House, who bought it immediately.

14:47.014 --> 14:48.656
That's great.

14:48.916 --> 14:52.299
Yeah, and Bob Loomis is just an incredible editor.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.061
Well, he's wonderful.

14:54.081 --> 14:58.105
I mean, besides being a great editor, just an incredibly good guy.

14:58.912 --> 15:00.755
I mean, I'd send him pages of stuff.

15:00.875 --> 15:04.681
I wrote a 1,500-page draft, essentially.

15:04.701 --> 15:08.466
I'd send him pages of stuff, and he would call the moment he got it.

15:10.169 --> 15:13.734
And he would call within two or three days, and we'd talk about it.

15:14.315 --> 15:21.045
It was not, you know, the worst thing in the world for a writer is to hang on there and wait and say, oh, fuck, he doesn't like it.

15:21.185 --> 15:25.271
You know, it's another feeling.

15:25.291 --> 15:28.075
He was wonderful, but to get back to the

15:28.763 --> 15:38.615
I knew I had a story with the, and I thought that was the climax, the end of the Grace negotiation in which Schlickman goes off to Hawaii.

15:39.676 --> 15:41.278
He says, make me whole again to Gordon.

15:41.298 --> 15:41.979
They got $8 million.

15:42.419 --> 15:43.641
It wasn't what they expected.

15:44.141 --> 15:50.189
Case turns out not to be the landmark that he had hoped, and he didn't get nearly the money.

15:50.209 --> 15:51.510
But that's his problem, though, isn't it?

15:51.530 --> 15:52.491
That's his problem.

15:52.792 --> 15:54.314
In effect, it was my problem.

15:54.334 --> 15:57.117
I mean, I would have been much luckier as a writer

15:58.227 --> 16:04.275
In one sense, I was very lucky because I got inside and I followed the arc of this guy's destruction.

16:04.295 --> 16:09.522
In another sense, I was unlucky because the case, what if the case had been a landmark?

16:09.542 --> 16:17.232
Then I would have been writing, you know, like Anthony Lewis, writing about Gideon's trumpet, you know, a landmark case.

16:17.252 --> 16:18.134
Well, what's wrong with that?

16:18.774 --> 16:19.295
That's great.

16:19.716 --> 16:21.538
I wish it had been, you know.

16:21.999 --> 16:28.167
From a writer's standpoint, I wish it had established new law and changed, you know, the behavior of

16:29.227 --> 16:43.467
But I think reading it, and I think the book's worth, is that aside from not being a landmark, but it's really the way this shit goes down day after day, and this is really what it's like.

16:44.348 --> 16:54.762
And let's talk about Jen now, and maybe if you could respond to my suggestion that maybe he is.

16:55.163 --> 17:24.985
kind of a tragic hero being afflicted as you already pointed out excessive pride and hubris and all these other things is that a fair observation on my part that maybe he does I think that's an observation you can certainly draw from the book from my own standpoint it became apparent to me that this really was Greek tragedy I mean here was a guy suing truth and justice or his version what he believed to be truth and justice

17:25.589 --> 17:29.116
and willing to sacrifice everything for it.

17:30.398 --> 17:33.464
It was true hubris.

17:34.566 --> 17:40.077
And by contrast to Greek tragedy, is it not quixotic as well?

17:40.157 --> 17:40.417
It is.

17:40.557 --> 17:42.621
It's both, you know.

17:42.641 --> 17:45.066
It's tilting at windmills as well as...

17:45.923 --> 17:54.296
And that scene where he brings all these experts into it, puts them up at the Ritz, pays them 200 bucks an hour, feeds them.

17:54.316 --> 17:55.437
Pays them for sleeping, right?

17:55.457 --> 17:58.482
Yeah, this one guy bills them 100 bucks for sleeping.

17:58.502 --> 18:01.226
And that pisses me off, you see.

18:01.246 --> 18:05.773
I mean, you know, because we, whatever we do for research, we pay.

18:05.833 --> 18:06.614
It comes out of here.

18:06.634 --> 18:10.300
And this guy is in now for, what, 2.6 million or something?

18:10.320 --> 18:10.440
Right.

18:10.460 --> 18:13.745
And so if he gets eight, it's a wash for him, right?

18:14.005 --> 18:14.787
He's not even.

18:14.807 --> 18:15.087
Right.

18:15.674 --> 18:19.049
Well, he was actually, even eight didn't do it for him.

18:19.069 --> 18:22.082
He had to pay 2.6 million in fees.

18:22.162 --> 18:24.573
I mean, he had these bills hanging over.

18:24.593 --> 18:25.718
He essentially got

18:26.137 --> 18:31.183
But that $2.6 million doesn't reflect the day-to-day operating costs of the office.

18:31.323 --> 18:34.346
And what he lost by all the work that he couldn't take, for that matter.

18:34.366 --> 18:42.775
He lost that, and he wasn't compensated for paying the electric bills, for paying the rent on the office.

18:42.876 --> 18:47.681
The fee expenses in the case don't cover that kind of thing.

18:47.701 --> 18:53.207
So not only did he not take other business, but it was for him in that loss.

18:53.693 --> 18:54.995
You know, that's the risk you take.

18:55.276 --> 18:56.037
Exactly so.

18:56.057 --> 18:58.581
You step up to the plate and take the swings.

18:58.601 --> 19:02.728
He expected a far bigger reward, and that's why he invested what he did.

19:03.349 --> 19:12.826
And the reward he expected was certainly a monetary reward, not merely the fame and the notoriety that might have come.

19:13.327 --> 19:14.468
Both, I think.

19:14.488 --> 19:15.290
He wanted fame.

19:15.370 --> 19:17.153
Here's his line in the book, you know.

19:18.533 --> 19:19.354
I can't even remember.

19:19.434 --> 19:21.816
Fame, money, and doing good.

19:22.317 --> 19:23.618
Fame, fortune, and doing good.

19:23.979 --> 19:26.181
Listen, I can put some of this in a glass.

19:26.341 --> 19:28.764
Yeah, actually, if you could.

19:28.784 --> 19:29.084
Why not?

19:29.545 --> 19:32.448
I would like a shot of it.

19:33.409 --> 19:39.215
I'm amazed, though, that you didn't tape record anything.

19:39.235 --> 19:39.475
I really am.

19:39.495 --> 19:40.717
I just don't like too much.

19:41.017 --> 19:42.699
But did you get people to sign releases?

19:43.580 --> 19:44.741
I'm flipping.

19:46.282 --> 19:46.843
Nobody else.

19:47.063 --> 19:47.764
I didn't get any.

19:48.368 --> 19:56.842
Joe McGinnis, who I haven't talked to since, has got anything, only because he had to keep me treated.

19:56.902 --> 20:04.855
But I remember he told me, the only time he ever got a release from anybody was from Jeffrey McDonald.

20:04.875 --> 20:06.077
No, no, no, that's the other one.

20:06.097 --> 20:06.798
McDonald, yeah.

20:06.818 --> 20:07.640
McDonald, yeah.

20:07.660 --> 20:10.885
The only time he ever had a release from Casey Voss, you know?

20:10.905 --> 20:13.950
Yeah, they're essentially not worth the paper they're written on.

20:13.970 --> 20:15.152
They're worthless, yeah.

20:15.706 --> 20:34.330
It seems to me that if somebody's talking to a reporter and you tell them you're writing a book, you're taking notes in front of them, as long as you don't libel them, in the privacy issues, they essentially waive the privacy issues, especially with lawyers.

20:34.951 --> 20:39.376
There's no way they could argue they didn't know I was doing a book.

20:39.476 --> 20:44.683
How did that one instance where Schlichman goes to New York and he

20:45.035 --> 20:48.759
terrible, and he's going to go on Good Morning America.

20:48.779 --> 20:49.720
Ricky Kleeman, right?

20:49.741 --> 20:52.824
He really entered the bedroom with him.

20:53.845 --> 20:55.447
Well, I knew about the New York thing.

20:55.467 --> 21:01.514
I'd interviewed Schlickman about that, and he didn't tell me about the bedroom scene.

21:01.534 --> 21:07.782
And Donna Robbins I'd talked to, and Tom Kiley I'd talked to, who was all parties there.

21:09.263 --> 21:11.506
I'd talked to Ricky quite a bit earlier.

21:11.546 --> 21:14.029
I'd had two or three interviews with her before then.

21:14.448 --> 21:17.772
And it was about three weeks after that night.

21:19.335 --> 21:20.076
No, it was longer than that.

21:20.096 --> 21:21.698
It was probably six weeks after that night.

21:22.359 --> 21:24.261
We went out to dinner, the three of us.

21:24.281 --> 21:28.387
I mean, Jan kind of never really wanted to be alone with her.

21:29.268 --> 21:30.169
Don't put that in.

21:30.830 --> 21:33.454
I don't know how much of this I'm going to put in.

21:33.474 --> 21:35.116
Yeah, I know.

21:35.476 --> 21:36.538
The three of us went out to dinner.

21:37.279 --> 21:39.181
Because I hadn't talked to Ricky about that night.

21:39.322 --> 21:43.307
Because I wanted more, I felt like I didn't have the detail, the texture of it.

21:43.625 --> 21:46.428
And Jan was there and Ricky was there.

21:46.468 --> 21:47.750
I started asking him about it.

21:47.850 --> 21:49.732
In fact, we went to dinner here in Lafayette.

21:49.753 --> 21:50.493
Ask him about what?

21:50.654 --> 21:51.955
About that night in New York.

21:52.155 --> 21:54.679
But also tell me why it's pertinent.

21:55.680 --> 21:57.662
Why she made love to him, for instance.

21:58.183 --> 22:00.366
Why that was pertinent to using your book.

22:00.386 --> 22:01.387
Okay, I'll tell you.

22:01.807 --> 22:05.011
But let me tell you how I got the information to begin with.

22:05.151 --> 22:08.375
I wanted more texture for that night.

22:08.576 --> 22:09.717
I wanted more to know.

22:09.950 --> 22:11.772
to know more about what Jan was like.

22:12.052 --> 22:16.438
And Ricky is really quite an astute observer.

22:16.778 --> 22:20.582
And so we came to dinner here at Lafayette, as I recall.

22:21.163 --> 22:22.405
And I started asking him about it.

22:23.346 --> 22:24.868
And Ricky started telling me.

22:25.428 --> 22:27.751
She told me about this confusion about who gets what room.

22:27.831 --> 22:28.912
And I went upstairs.

22:28.952 --> 22:30.855
She had no idea which room she was going into.

22:31.575 --> 22:36.621
And Jan motions the guy with her bags into the room that his bags are going into.

22:37.402 --> 22:38.083
She then knows.

22:39.025 --> 22:40.787
And at that juncture, I stopped writing.

22:40.807 --> 22:42.970
I mean, I was taking notes.

22:43.931 --> 22:47.455
And she said, no, no, I want you to write this down.

22:48.657 --> 22:50.880
So I started writing again.

22:51.380 --> 22:54.905
Flickman's face was going down lower and lower, and it was soup.

22:56.386 --> 23:02.934
And she told me the story, ending with, that was great sex, and he'll never remember a moment of it.

23:03.335 --> 23:07.480
A line, when I called, when I sent her the reader's edition,

23:08.101 --> 23:11.425
She called me up and she said, it's exactly like I remember.

23:11.886 --> 23:14.208
There's one thing I'd change, it was that line.

23:15.069 --> 23:18.814
And then she said, but I said it, so I won't change it.

23:20.176 --> 23:23.360
And then she called me back two days later and said, listen, I have a request.

23:23.840 --> 23:25.823
Can you change sex to something else?

23:26.463 --> 23:27.725
So like it was a great night.

23:28.286 --> 23:33.091
And the reader's edition says it was great sex, and the book itself says it was a great night.

23:33.892 --> 23:34.373
It happens.

23:34.393 --> 23:36.175
You have to do it.

23:36.215 --> 23:36.475
Yeah.

23:36.496 --> 23:37.737
I made similar...

23:38.088 --> 23:40.191
concessions to people.

23:40.211 --> 23:40.831
It was fine.

23:40.951 --> 23:42.573
You know, she'd been so great with me.

23:44.075 --> 23:45.717
So I had no problem.

23:45.737 --> 23:47.620
I would have preferred it, the way she said it.

23:47.800 --> 23:49.302
She admitted she said it that way.

23:50.583 --> 23:54.168
Maybe Schlickle would have preferred it too.

23:54.208 --> 23:58.152
Testament to his self-image.

23:58.873 --> 24:02.117
So she told me this.

24:02.898 --> 24:03.959
I thought I was wonderful.

24:04.821 --> 24:06.863
Jan didn't say a word.

24:07.231 --> 24:10.915
The next day, he asked me if I had to put that in the book.

24:10.935 --> 24:13.298
And I said, no, I don't have to, but I'd like to.

24:15.280 --> 24:16.721
And he said, well, do what you want.

24:17.622 --> 24:18.543
But why?

24:19.184 --> 24:25.751
Well, this was a woman who admitted, frankly, that she was pursuing him.

24:25.771 --> 24:35.382
And when we first meet her, she flies up to Boston to watch him and give the summation in a very important case of his.

24:36.391 --> 24:41.058
She's the one who gets him to come to Puerto Rico where he meets Charlie Nusson.

24:41.919 --> 24:47.588
And throughout it, there's this business of her thinking that someday they'll get together.

24:47.608 --> 24:49.130
They'll be married and they'll have kids.

24:49.911 --> 24:52.916
She thought she could be in love with this guy.

24:52.936 --> 25:00.667
And the book didn't have to have it, but it seemed to be, I mean, it was true life.

25:00.888 --> 25:02.090
It really did happen.

25:02.130 --> 25:05.014
And this is kind of the arc, the culmination of her

25:05.433 --> 25:08.717
pursuit of him, which ends there.

25:09.898 --> 25:15.445
Do you think that at the end when he's swimming out, of course he's since come back, I understand.

25:15.465 --> 25:16.586
Yeah.

25:16.606 --> 25:18.248
Three years in Hawaii, now he's back.

25:19.950 --> 25:20.831
Doing what?

25:22.893 --> 25:26.738
He's practicing law with Tom Kiley, but he's not doing a lot of it.

25:27.839 --> 25:29.020
He's very indifferent about it.

25:29.040 --> 25:30.382
He really doesn't want to practice law.

25:30.402 --> 25:32.905
Well, did the case break him?

25:32.925 --> 25:33.165
Yeah.

25:33.345 --> 25:34.967
Emotionally, not just...

25:35.285 --> 25:39.650
It was very close to a complete breakdown.

25:39.670 --> 25:41.533
I think he really was suicidal.

25:42.174 --> 25:53.788
There's also a scene in the book where one of his clients, Catherine Gamache, says to him, with great concern, we hope you're not going to jump out the window here.

25:54.609 --> 26:00.837
This is after the appeals court delivers its affirmation of Skinner.

26:02.133 --> 26:04.437
And he says, I'm not going to do anything like that.

26:04.457 --> 26:13.634
But I think he was, he says, I don't know if he was ever going to truly commit suicide, but he was an incredible despondent.

26:13.654 --> 26:14.756
You mentioned Skinner.

26:14.776 --> 26:24.654
This might be a way to talk in generalities about the legal system, but you also point out at one point how the jury gives him a gift to keep the door open.

26:25.155 --> 26:25.255
Yeah.

26:25.943 --> 26:33.713
I'm thinking of the Simpson case where the jurors come back to Catalina and they give, you know, some cigars or something.

26:34.274 --> 26:39.822
And you have all this, you know, Cochran posturing, as he's been doing, about this one juror.

26:40.603 --> 26:41.944
He's going to taint the jury.

26:41.964 --> 26:44.187
He wants this juror dismissed.

26:45.810 --> 26:46.791
How do you feel this book?

26:46.971 --> 26:52.879
Is this book a commentary on the legal system, which is really under intensive scrutiny now and has been?

26:53.365 --> 26:58.531
So for the last year, certainly the criminal side, not the civil side, but I think we're looking at lawyers.

26:58.832 --> 27:01.876
Well, civil side is under great scrutiny, too, limiting liability.

27:01.896 --> 27:07.843
Exactly, which you wrote about in the op-ed page a couple months ago.

27:07.863 --> 27:09.005
So just take it anywhere you want.

27:09.525 --> 27:16.574
I'm glad you asked that question, because I've been trying to prepare for this, figuring out what the hell I'm going to say to these things, and I've got something prepared.

27:17.636 --> 27:20.419
It's essentially...

27:21.243 --> 27:28.312
I'll try and give you the speech I want to give when I'm on radio or something.

27:28.372 --> 27:30.275
Don't tell them you've got to prepare them.

27:30.295 --> 27:30.856
Of course not.

27:31.136 --> 27:35.161
But I can tell you, because I know you're not going to write it.

27:35.181 --> 27:40.428
But it's the whole author tour business, and I'm completely new to this, and as anxious as you can possibly be.

27:40.448 --> 27:42.471
I'm going through exactly the same thing.

27:42.531 --> 27:47.638
Monday, I'm taping a thing for NPR in Washington, and then I'm taping this one hour.

27:48.192 --> 27:49.073
C-span thing.

27:49.093 --> 27:50.855
I said, what the fuck do you do to get ready for this?

27:51.275 --> 27:55.920
One hour with Brian Lamb, who is as laconic as— Well, but he's—I've watched him now.

27:55.940 --> 27:56.861
I knew this was coming.

27:56.881 --> 27:58.722
I don't need this on tape, if you don't mind.

27:58.742 --> 28:00.144
You've got a little time, but I know.

28:00.164 --> 28:01.145
I'll get some more quotes.

28:01.165 --> 28:01.645
I'm sorry, go ahead.

28:02.146 --> 28:03.067
You're talking about Redford.

28:03.087 --> 28:04.148
Yeah, Redford bought your book.

28:04.608 --> 28:05.970
Yeah, Redford bought my book.

28:06.390 --> 28:10.654
I'm distinctly the poor cousin next to Nick Evans, but I have utterly no complaint.

28:10.854 --> 28:13.457
That's not a bad number, though, as reported.

28:13.741 --> 28:14.683
The 1.4?

28:14.723 --> 28:15.284
1.25.

28:15.865 --> 28:16.666
Is it 1.25?

28:16.846 --> 28:19.270
Yeah, it's actually not.

28:20.172 --> 28:20.612
It's 1.

28:20.933 --> 28:22.015
But 1 is nice.

28:22.996 --> 28:25.160
Believe me, it's incredible.

28:26.182 --> 28:26.823
Are you kidding?

28:27.243 --> 28:32.312
I wouldn't have survived yesterday's New York Times review, and it wasn't even a bad review, but I would have been so.

28:33.113 --> 28:34.355
Was it not a bad review?

28:34.395 --> 28:39.664
As one who writes them, I write a lot of reviews, too, in addition to my column.

28:40.859 --> 28:42.541
I read the whole review.

28:42.561 --> 28:44.104
He liked the book, it seemed to me.

28:44.324 --> 28:45.005
Grudgingly.

28:46.447 --> 28:49.111
Well, yeah, he came to it at the end.

28:50.232 --> 28:54.418
But, see, he saw that Harvard thing and he smacked his lips.

28:55.440 --> 28:59.686
And finally he has a chance to tell the readers that he went to Harvard, I guess.

29:00.206 --> 29:02.209
And then he goes to the Harvard Club in New York.

29:02.950 --> 29:03.491
Big deal.

29:03.731 --> 29:05.875
Big fucking deal, as they say.

29:05.895 --> 29:07.517
Let's get back on track with the book.

29:07.537 --> 29:10.461
We were talking, you were going to give me your response to

29:10.778 --> 29:24.777
The legal system, OJ, all this other stuff, and also the congressional effort now to limit... Legal cap liability and limit access.

29:25.158 --> 29:26.179
Take it anywhere you want.

29:27.521 --> 29:39.958
I don't stand here as an expert in the law, nor did I set out to write a polemic about legal reform.

29:40.529 --> 29:53.741
What I wanted to do, and what I think I've done, is I wrote about one case, and insofar as that case can shed light, can be emblematic in any way of other cases, then I've succeeded.

29:55.042 --> 29:58.986
But if you notice in the book, there is no kind of polemic.

29:59.206 --> 30:00.547
I don't make the judgment.

30:00.627 --> 30:06.112
I let people come to the conclusion themselves that the system doesn't work perfectly.

30:06.893 --> 30:08.494
For my money, however,

30:09.436 --> 30:11.158
It's a very good system.

30:11.178 --> 30:19.927
It gives people access to the courts, and I truly think it's one of the best systems in the world.

30:20.248 --> 30:25.954
But it's a system created by human beings, and it's a system in which it's run— It's abused, too.

30:26.294 --> 30:27.355
It's abused, it's true.

30:27.516 --> 30:32.481
And again, I hate to jump over to the criminal side, but just look at this Simpson thing in California.

30:32.501 --> 30:33.142
It's outrageous.

30:34.003 --> 30:35.224
It is, but what would you do?

30:36.031 --> 30:37.614
take the television camera out?

30:37.914 --> 30:41.861
Well, there are all kinds of minor adjustments that one can make along the way.

30:42.141 --> 30:56.665
The problem is that the system, it's not the principles behind the system, the principle of fairness, the principle of a jury deciding your case, and the principle of access, the promise of fairness and that you'll get your case heard.

30:57.046 --> 30:59.810
All of those principles are wonderful principles.

31:00.752 --> 31:01.954
The fact is that people

31:02.525 --> 31:05.309
are running these organizations, and people are fallible.

31:05.409 --> 31:07.391
People have their biases.

31:07.632 --> 31:11.416
You know, Jefferson said about democracy, you have to be eternally vigilant.

31:11.897 --> 31:16.363
And I think that's true of any system, of the legal system.

31:16.383 --> 31:19.587
Exposure to light, seeing how the system works.

31:20.568 --> 31:24.313
The OJ case may result in legal reforms of a sort.

31:24.333 --> 31:27.217
I don't think that these guys are playing to the cameras, though.

31:27.237 --> 31:27.897
You don't?

31:27.917 --> 31:31.502
Well, I'm sure that they are, but I don't think the cameras are the sole reason for this case

31:32.444 --> 31:33.706
going on for eight months.

31:34.728 --> 31:39.575
Well, all I know is the Susan Smith thing comes on, and it's slam-bam out two weeks.

31:40.537 --> 31:45.485
I'm wondering if... Susan Smith didn't have $5 million to hire a team of lawyers.

31:45.505 --> 31:50.092
But if it had national television on it, maybe there would have been some pro bono stuff there, too.

31:50.453 --> 31:52.196
I wonder what these guys in the L.A.

31:52.256 --> 31:52.977
case would take.

31:53.618 --> 31:56.363
I mean, this is probably a $20 million defense, right?

31:56.923 --> 31:57.344
Who knows?

31:57.504 --> 31:59.768
I think whatever his net worth is, is what the

32:00.119 --> 32:01.180
Exactly.

32:01.501 --> 32:04.925
Charndyze versus Charndyze.

32:05.145 --> 32:09.230
The trial, the lawsuit goes on until there's no money left and then it ends.

32:09.270 --> 32:11.533
You saw the woman who was doing the Menendez brothers.

32:11.573 --> 32:12.774
They've got no more money.

32:12.855 --> 32:18.001
I mean, that was a very serious, you know, she's telling you something there, I think.

32:19.122 --> 32:19.863
I guess it's true.

32:19.883 --> 32:21.665
You know, trial is theater.

32:22.666 --> 32:23.207
It really is.

32:23.227 --> 32:23.447
Oh, it is.

32:23.888 --> 32:26.011
And it's, it can be.

32:26.451 --> 32:28.033
But it's also supposed to be justice.

32:28.587 --> 32:29.809
Interesting point.

32:29.909 --> 32:31.752
You know, I mean, is it abused?

32:31.812 --> 32:42.029
It probably is, but... Tell me a little bit about yourself, a little bit of the biographical stuff.

32:42.049 --> 32:45.394
Did you have any legal background knowledge prior to this case?

32:45.414 --> 32:46.656
Was it kind of on the job?

32:47.037 --> 32:48.880
It was definitely on the job, yeah.

32:49.801 --> 32:53.447
I had none in particular, no more than the average kind of interested person.

32:53.933 --> 32:59.641
As I said before I began this case, I had been interested in writing about medical malpractice as an issue.

32:59.661 --> 33:05.950
I kind of explored that very briefly and read some things, but I had no formal legal background at all.

33:06.671 --> 33:18.348
During the course of writing, I mean, I knew the fundamental kind of things like plaintiff's lawyers' work on contingency fees and expert witnesses, just generally what most people would know.

33:19.269 --> 33:23.535
I began writing about this around the time that LA Law was a terrific hit.

33:24.089 --> 33:25.931
And it was supposed to be done in two years.

33:26.031 --> 33:28.573
I thought I was going to miss the legal wave completely.

33:29.234 --> 33:31.275
No one knew it was going to be a tidal wave.

33:31.636 --> 33:33.417
But I think a good book is a good book.

33:36.080 --> 33:38.882
I have in my book, I did a lot of journalism for my book.

33:38.902 --> 33:41.404
Remember the book thief that stole the 23,000 books?

33:42.505 --> 33:43.506
Steven Blumberg.

33:43.767 --> 33:48.010
Remember the guy that went through 45 states and climbed up elevator shafts?

33:48.991 --> 33:50.433
You probably don't remember that.

33:50.513 --> 33:52.054
It was a pretty big story.

33:52.523 --> 33:57.092
I went to his trial, but he's been in prison now for four years.

33:57.213 --> 33:59.758
I'm fearful this story's going to get old, but it doesn't.

33:59.798 --> 34:02.343
When it comes out, it just renews attention.

34:03.766 --> 34:07.634
Ninety-nine percent of the people in America don't even remember this case.

34:07.654 --> 34:09.178
Of course, that's true.

34:10.560 --> 34:13.266
Maybe 99 is conservative.

34:13.837 --> 34:15.419
I know it because I live around here.

34:15.479 --> 34:16.000
I grew up in Lowell.

34:16.160 --> 34:21.327
Some people, when I describe it to them, they have this vague, vague memory of something like this.

34:21.347 --> 34:30.720
I mean, it was on 60 Minutes just before trial, and when it's on a program of that kind of dimension, it seeps in there, and they have this stupidity.

34:30.961 --> 34:31.902
Or up under the circumstances.

34:32.102 --> 34:34.926
Or they think they remember it kind of thing.

34:34.946 --> 34:40.694
In Grafton, where I live, of course, Wyman Gordon had this case where they polluted the groundwater.

34:41.495 --> 34:43.438
Thankfully, I live up on a hill.

34:44.093 --> 34:48.219
Common occurrences.

34:48.239 --> 34:49.360
It's quite a concern.

34:51.343 --> 34:51.503
Yeah.

34:51.564 --> 34:53.947
It's everybody's nightmare, isn't it?

34:53.967 --> 34:55.529
Can you trust the tap water?

34:55.549 --> 34:56.050
Exactly.

34:56.230 --> 34:56.931
Air and water.

34:56.971 --> 34:58.513
It's more fundamental than that.

34:58.533 --> 34:59.014
Air and water.

34:59.315 --> 34:59.595
Yeah.

34:59.615 --> 35:01.638
I mean, real basic stuff.

35:01.658 --> 35:05.603
And of course, your plaintiffs were basically blue-collar, working-class people.

35:05.784 --> 35:08.888
I mean, you talk about having the means to pursue a suit.

35:08.928 --> 35:09.789
You know, O.J.

35:09.809 --> 35:13.054
has maybe $20 million, and he can have this $15

35:13.625 --> 35:14.306
member team.

35:15.086 --> 35:18.870
So Schlichlin was actually doing this whole thing on spec.

35:19.250 --> 35:19.811
Absolutely.

35:19.851 --> 35:25.276
The way all plaintiff lawyers were usually not at such a scale.

35:26.377 --> 35:28.499
There is a disparity there, isn't it?

35:28.940 --> 35:37.147
Do you think you gave them the best defense, not defense, but the best presentation of their case that they could have received?

35:37.388 --> 35:41.632
To my mind, I don't believe anyone could have done better.

35:41.652 --> 35:42.973
I mean, this is a guy who went

35:43.105 --> 35:43.946
to every length.

35:43.966 --> 35:45.288
And he didn't do it just for them.

35:45.328 --> 35:46.290
He did it for himself.

35:46.310 --> 35:46.831
Of course.

35:47.632 --> 35:52.359
But he spent money, the kind of money no other lawyer would be willing to risk.

35:52.399 --> 35:53.941
He risked everything.

35:54.983 --> 35:56.685
And he's a damn good lawyer.

35:57.326 --> 35:57.927
He really is.

35:57.987 --> 36:07.842
He's incredibly thorough and a quick study on things like hydrogeology and all kinds of medical stuff.

36:08.263 --> 36:08.924
He's a good lawyer.

36:08.944 --> 36:09.805
He's a smart guy.

36:10.443 --> 36:13.226
Did he give him the best that anyone could have given him?

36:13.266 --> 36:18.072
I don't know how anyone could say, even though some of the people are disenchanted with him at this point.

36:18.152 --> 36:19.454
They wanted more money, of course.

36:20.615 --> 36:23.158
As he said, when there's money on the table, things turn ugly.

36:24.239 --> 36:27.223
Isn't that true?

36:27.703 --> 36:31.828
There are other very skilled, very talented lawyers who could have done the same.

36:32.168 --> 36:33.570
The question is, would they?

36:33.951 --> 36:36.474
Would they be willing to put everything at risk to do it?

36:37.755 --> 36:39.437
Do you think that your presence...

36:39.822 --> 36:46.630
in these sessions and these things affected any of what happened?

36:46.670 --> 36:49.473
We talked about posturing and talking to the camera.

36:49.493 --> 36:51.876
Well, you were the camera.

36:51.896 --> 36:51.996
Yeah.

36:52.016 --> 36:52.457
Good question.

36:52.477 --> 36:53.918
Were they alert to your presence?

36:53.938 --> 37:05.712
And you think maybe some of this bravado and these great quotes came knowingly that Boswell is here, you know, and there's a book in the office with a contract, so there is a book in the office.

37:05.860 --> 37:14.008
He was interested in the book and remained interested in it for quite a while, except when he went off to Hawaii, I didn't speak to him for a year and a half, and I simply couldn't reach him.

37:14.048 --> 37:14.528
I tried to.

37:14.668 --> 37:15.869
I had a lot of questions to ask.

37:16.910 --> 37:21.074
I think it's a question you can't really answer.

37:22.015 --> 37:25.378
Did my presence affect the outcome?

37:25.539 --> 37:27.540
Not the outcome so much.

37:27.640 --> 37:29.242
Or affect their behavior.

37:29.322 --> 37:35.648
Certainly, I think there's no possible argument that my presence affected the outcome.

37:35.881 --> 37:38.604
it may have affected their behavior to some degree.

37:39.164 --> 37:40.346
I tend to think not.

37:40.566 --> 37:43.529
I mean, you become a piece of the furniture, really.

37:45.011 --> 37:53.299
And in the heat of matters, when they become passionate about something, you know, it doesn't matter who the hell is around.

37:54.641 --> 38:02.269
In the writing, you're very, very aware to keep yourself entirely out of it.

38:02.409 --> 38:05.432
I mean, you really are the unseen...

38:06.425 --> 38:13.335
I'm not a participant, but in some cases you're the only person there while the conversation is going on.

38:13.355 --> 38:15.157
You mentioned it at the back.

38:15.177 --> 38:21.606
Well, obviously I'm the only one there, and the person engaging in the colloquy is me.

38:21.886 --> 38:29.036
But why was it so important to you, even in those cases, to keep yourself entirely out of it?

38:30.278 --> 38:33.242
There's only so many ways you can write.

38:33.526 --> 38:33.946
the book.

38:35.008 --> 38:36.349
You can use the first person.

38:36.769 --> 38:38.992
I find it intrusive.

38:39.012 --> 38:53.667
I do too, but sometimes, as in cases like that, I wonder if that's the only... Well, there's a device that Tracy called First Person Limited, which essentially is the way he told The Soul of a New Machine.

38:54.628 --> 39:01.035
Thereafter, as following three books, he was always the omniscient, the third person, narrated in the third person.

39:01.707 --> 39:04.191
First person limited has its use.

39:04.652 --> 39:07.296
You have to introduce yourself fairly early.

39:08.458 --> 39:10.681
And then you essentially can fade from the scene.

39:11.122 --> 39:13.206
And when necessary, you can appear again.

39:13.546 --> 39:14.748
You know, Conway said to me.

39:14.828 --> 39:19.155
But I can't have suddenly, you know, on page 200 of the book, Conway said to me.

39:19.195 --> 39:22.160
I mean, it has to be set up in a way.

39:22.180 --> 39:25.405
And I didn't see a way to set it up early on.

39:26.467 --> 39:28.390
And moreover, I think...

39:29.737 --> 39:31.840
I simply didn't want to.

39:31.880 --> 39:35.464
It's just a device that's a narrative device.

39:37.186 --> 39:45.437
What I had to say about this, my observations of it, or how I got the story, you know, is not... Well, nobody gives a shit about how I got the story.

39:45.457 --> 39:46.078
Yeah, exactly.

39:47.339 --> 39:50.604
And I didn't have any particular profound observations.

39:50.684 --> 39:52.025
I didn't want to be an actor in this.

39:52.085 --> 39:53.487
I wanted to watch the other people.

39:53.707 --> 39:54.869
No, I absolutely believe.

39:54.949 --> 39:58.073
I mean, I get so angry when I see reporters whining about Ohio.

39:58.897 --> 40:00.880
I don't know how rude somebody is, but who cares?

40:00.900 --> 40:03.985
That's not what you're getting paid for.

40:04.005 --> 40:06.008
Get the story.

40:06.088 --> 40:08.332
I really wanted to keep myself out of it.

40:09.093 --> 40:11.016
And I think I still do.

40:11.076 --> 40:15.323
I can't envision a circumstance in which I'm not the actor.

40:17.687 --> 40:18.628
Just a couple of things.

40:19.169 --> 40:20.551
What's up in Stonehenge?

40:20.671 --> 40:26.220
I have to be taped for something.

40:27.078 --> 40:30.081
Oh, I don't know what it is.

40:30.101 --> 40:32.183
Continental Cablevision, a bookcase.

40:35.626 --> 40:40.211
Tell me briefly about yourself, where you're from, how old you are, why?

40:41.392 --> 40:41.992
Forty-six.

40:42.593 --> 40:43.614
Just turned forty-six.

40:44.935 --> 40:46.657
I'm married, no kids.

40:47.238 --> 40:54.925
My wife teaches at Smith, where I taught briefly, a course of non-fiction.

40:56.795 --> 40:58.778
I was born in Wisconsin.

40:59.799 --> 41:05.247
Never lived any place for more than three years in my entire life until New Haven, where I met my wife.

41:06.389 --> 41:13.158
Wisconsin, Chicago, Berkeley.

41:13.499 --> 41:15.041
My father was in the diplomatic corps.

41:15.101 --> 41:17.284
Israel, Germany, France.

41:17.304 --> 41:25.536
I went to school at William & Mary.

41:26.292 --> 41:34.387
I started working as a journalist in New York at ABC Radio.

41:35.128 --> 41:37.473
I wasn't a journalist, I was a gopher, essentially.

41:37.994 --> 41:39.176
Got me interested in news.

41:40.659 --> 41:41.921
But I was more interested in writing.

41:43.003 --> 41:49.515
I knew I wanted to write since I was about 11 years old.

41:50.761 --> 41:53.264
I started reading Sherlock Holmes, Arthur Conan Doyle.

41:53.304 --> 41:56.148
My father had this great, thick book.

41:56.168 --> 41:58.130
It was just riveting.

41:58.150 --> 42:02.816
I just loved it.

42:03.557 --> 42:09.084
So I left ABC and went to work for Scott Meredith, a literary agent.

42:09.304 --> 42:15.733
Got fired from them because I was put in foreign rights and I was doing nothing but writing these fucking letters.

42:16.934 --> 42:18.456
And I couldn't get the letters right.

42:20.461 --> 42:21.442
I love these guys.

42:22.603 --> 42:24.846
That's good.

42:24.866 --> 42:27.169
You know, I did some work.

42:28.270 --> 42:31.934
Went to New Haven and did some work for the New Haven Register.

42:31.954 --> 42:33.396
A lousy paper.

42:33.416 --> 42:34.537
Oh, it sucks.

42:34.738 --> 42:38.062
We bought like a horrible chain to it.

42:38.082 --> 42:39.804
Dreadful paper.

42:39.824 --> 42:40.104
Just the pits.

42:40.124 --> 42:43.127
Then I started working for a weekly newspaper.

42:44.048 --> 42:47.953
This was in the mid-70s when weekly newspapers were

42:48.254 --> 42:51.098
It was like the real paper from the Phoenix where they were.

42:51.639 --> 42:53.362
They really meant something in those days.

42:53.762 --> 42:59.430
They were carrying the kind of news that the traditional papers didn't carry, anti-nuke stuff that were following that.

43:01.474 --> 43:09.345
Not that I was ever terrifically political on that score, but papers gave me an opportunity to write long.

43:10.988 --> 43:14.513
And that's essentially where I developed my repertorial skills.

43:14.673 --> 43:17.417
I could write 2,000 or 3,000 word pieces

43:18.055 --> 43:20.137
And I did it in New Haven mostly.

43:20.157 --> 43:21.899
I wrote a story about a federal judge.

43:21.939 --> 43:24.542
I wrote a story about a slumlord in 3,000-word pieces.

43:24.622 --> 43:30.248
And I was, throughout that time, I was trying to develop this, you know, you tell a story.

43:30.489 --> 43:33.652
You don't just, you know, lay facts down on the page.

43:33.752 --> 43:41.541
But you, for me, people, people are what drive, you know, characters, what drives every narrative.

43:41.561 --> 43:43.843
And if you can bring a character to life,

43:45.022 --> 43:49.546
And there's an interesting circumstance, conflict, that the character's caught up, and you have a story there.

43:49.706 --> 43:51.788
And so why not try and tell it like a story?

43:52.729 --> 43:55.832
And that's, I was given 2,000 or 3,000 words.

43:55.872 --> 44:00.396
I had to crank out a story a week and do the reporting, too.

44:01.297 --> 44:02.899
It was fun.

44:03.379 --> 44:06.622
I don't remember having slept a full night for years.

44:09.485 --> 44:10.225
So what's next?

44:11.487 --> 44:11.907
I'm going to...

44:13.253 --> 44:15.897
I have a story from a New Yorker I was supposed to finish.

44:16.057 --> 44:17.960
It was supposed to be finished August 31st.

44:20.063 --> 44:20.704
I didn't finish.

44:20.884 --> 44:24.249
It was about the crash of 427 in Pittsburgh.

44:25.611 --> 44:26.392
Incredible story.

44:27.173 --> 44:27.774
That was U.S.

44:27.794 --> 44:28.255
Air, right?

44:28.315 --> 44:28.615
Yeah.

44:28.776 --> 44:30.358
Flying U.S.

44:30.378 --> 44:30.679
Air.

44:31.360 --> 44:32.601
Perfectly good, safe.

44:32.621 --> 44:33.603
Oh, they're pretty good, yeah.

44:33.643 --> 44:39.652
I took a commuter plane out to Syracuse last year, and this was like... I hope not during an ice storm.

44:40.253 --> 44:42.015
No, it was one of those planes, too.

44:42.095 --> 44:42.636
Yeah.

44:42.768 --> 44:44.109
The ATRs?

44:44.590 --> 44:49.154
Yeah, I do some PW pieces and I went out to the Toby Wolfe.

44:49.174 --> 44:52.717
That was like a week before this accident you're talking about.

44:53.518 --> 44:55.180
So you're doing the New Yorker stuff.

44:55.200 --> 44:56.841
Who's the editor you deal with?

44:56.861 --> 44:57.542
Robert Vare.

44:58.983 --> 45:01.085
Is he the non-fiction editor?

45:01.105 --> 45:04.588
I thought Joe Finder's brother was Henry Finder.

45:04.608 --> 45:05.409
Is he at the New Yorker?

45:05.449 --> 45:05.970
I don't know him.

45:06.891 --> 45:11.695
I know Vare because he was at the New York Times and I was doing some pieces with him there.

45:12.603 --> 45:13.965
And he left to go to The New Yorker.

45:15.206 --> 45:18.330
So, I just thought I'd go along.

45:18.350 --> 45:19.471
That's a great fit for you.

45:19.491 --> 45:19.891
That's great.

45:20.192 --> 45:21.373
Good week.

45:21.393 --> 45:22.535
Yeah.

45:24.237 --> 45:24.477
It is.

45:24.557 --> 45:26.159
I mean, it's very visible.

45:26.319 --> 45:28.481
I always wanted to write for The New Yorker.

45:28.542 --> 45:36.991
The problem is, you know, these things take a long time to do a story like this.

45:37.011 --> 45:40.095
It takes a lot of reporting.

45:40.548 --> 45:42.690
It doesn't pay.

45:42.931 --> 45:44.672
Even at the New Yorker, you know.

45:45.033 --> 45:47.175
Well, they're more than 3,000 words out there.

45:47.195 --> 45:48.517
They're more like 5,000 or 6,000.

45:48.577 --> 45:49.578
Yeah.

45:49.598 --> 45:52.000
I think I have 8,500 words to write.

45:52.020 --> 45:52.381
That's a lot.

45:52.721 --> 45:55.564
Do they pay you by the piece or by the word?

45:55.584 --> 45:56.525
They pay you by the word.

45:56.665 --> 45:57.066
They do.

45:57.246 --> 45:57.346
Yeah.

45:57.406 --> 45:59.809
Like a buck a word, a buck and a half a word, something like that.

45:59.829 --> 46:01.090
It's a buck and a half now.

46:01.290 --> 46:01.510
Yeah.

46:03.172 --> 46:07.737
But it's still, you know, if you spend four months on something like that… That's a lot of work.

46:08.020 --> 46:10.263
Telephone calls, travel, travel.

46:10.283 --> 46:11.385
Yeah.

46:11.405 --> 46:17.813
A lot of reporting, a lot of agony in writing, and I find writing to be difficult.

46:17.833 --> 46:18.955
I really love reporting.

46:20.938 --> 46:22.019
Writing for me is hard.

46:23.702 --> 46:28.668
Unlike Tracy, who hates reporting and loves just to be sitting down and writing.

46:28.688 --> 46:29.409
I love reporting.

46:30.531 --> 46:33.555
I enjoy the writing, but it's a pain in the ass.

46:33.704 --> 46:36.668
But I love editing.

46:36.688 --> 46:39.711
I do love tinkering.

46:39.872 --> 46:40.572
That's the fun.

46:40.673 --> 46:43.796
Once you get the first draft down, that's when it starts to be fun.

46:43.816 --> 46:44.878
You can work with it.

46:44.898 --> 46:47.981
You can see how it's going to work, and you can slash stuff out.

46:48.082 --> 46:49.844
That's where the word process is so nice.

46:50.084 --> 46:58.294
Although, God knows, I've spent endless fixing one sentence.

46:59.168 --> 47:02.277
For a long time, I thought I was perfecting the sentence and losing the book.

47:02.297 --> 47:05.185
But on a word processor, you can keep perfecting the sentence.

47:05.425 --> 47:05.847
That's right.

47:05.867 --> 47:08.634
And you can perfect it so many times that you get back to where you started.

47:08.654 --> 47:11.743
I have, I mean, you took your time.
