WEBVTT

00:03.389 --> 00:03.869
Okay.

00:05.111 --> 00:05.451
Marsha?

00:07.032 --> 00:08.954
Could we go through the rare book thing once more?

00:09.995 --> 00:11.096
Like that story?

00:11.116 --> 00:11.597
That story, yeah.

00:12.578 --> 00:16.601
Well... And even use this very same... I have to.

00:18.723 --> 00:24.229
Suddenly, at a dinner at the Federal Reserve Board, I was asked by Chairman Paul Volcker, what makes the book rare?

00:24.729 --> 00:27.492
And nine heads turned toward me, and I was deeply embarrassed.

00:27.532 --> 00:30.915
And I said, well, Mr. Chairman, I said,

00:31.604 --> 00:37.150
It's really just a matter of supply and demand, which it is.

00:37.670 --> 00:44.277
And I was about to tell you, I was explaining to a man this morning, first of all, about the issue points and why one book was twice the price of the other.

00:45.078 --> 00:52.866
And then in the last 10 years only, thanks to the assiduousness of various bibliographers, there were issue points on dust wrappers.

00:52.886 --> 00:56.129
So now it's no longer The Great Gatsby with a dust wrapper.

00:56.209 --> 00:59.012
It's The Great Gatsby in, I don't know how many,

00:59.515 --> 01:10.187
Issues have been found, like five, and so that the first issue of the Tusk Trapper... But have they been able to determine which was the first... I think so, at least to some... And that's kind of a guess, isn't it?

01:10.207 --> 01:11.349
I mean... It's all very good.

01:11.469 --> 01:15.734
You did get Knopf and some of the other publishers today, which put dates on the best exactly.

01:15.754 --> 01:23.082
Yes, I don't even... I find it so absurd myself that I haven't even... And I don't have a great guess either.

01:23.102 --> 01:25.625
The prices, I guess, and the credits, and... I don't know.

01:26.105 --> 01:28.408
But it's extremely precious now, and much more...

01:28.912 --> 01:31.274
than it ever was in the turn of the century.

01:31.294 --> 01:36.759
We were talking also about a rare book is not necessarily a scarce book.

01:36.779 --> 01:38.561
A scarce book is not necessarily a rare book.

01:38.581 --> 01:46.408
I'll probably quote you on this Times piece, if that's your question, because you are answering, in essence, her question, what makes a book rare.

01:47.088 --> 01:47.189
Yeah.

01:48.490 --> 01:50.772
And it's quite obvious.

01:50.792 --> 01:52.874
If more people want it, then the right copy is available.

01:52.894 --> 01:58.699
Well, it's very hard to start out cold with somebody who has no... To whom it's a mystery.

01:58.932 --> 02:02.217
But I think we have to say taste and fashion.

02:02.237 --> 02:07.184
Yes, and that's why I tell people not to invest in books.

02:07.205 --> 02:08.166
It's investment.

02:08.206 --> 02:22.908
Yeah, one of the things I noted at the Bradley Martin sale on Americana, and this is something I think I would actually pursue in the piece, is that he was a high spot collector, so he really didn't need to collect any debt in American fiction.

02:22.928 --> 02:25.412
But he did have, you know, they were all debt authors,

02:25.831 --> 02:41.675
You actually, I think, could gauge literary reputation by the prices that were being paid by the same people in the same room for the best of the best.

02:41.795 --> 02:44.659
I mean, and everything was in quite nice condition.

02:44.679 --> 02:54.133
Do you think that, would you agree with that, that literary reputation is reflected by prices of books?

02:54.400 --> 03:04.679
Yes, but I'll tell you something like Fitzgerald and Hemingway, I think they're sustained so much by the notoriety of their private lives.

03:04.699 --> 03:16.020
You can't really say that because they get such enormous prices that they are the most respected as writers, don't you think?

03:16.574 --> 03:18.296
I was in the room with him.

03:18.316 --> 03:21.038
You can't even say that he has any literary status.

03:21.158 --> 03:22.800
No, that's even a better example.

03:22.820 --> 03:40.397
I don't go to these big auctions, but I remember once a, I think it was a very elaborately drunkenly inscribed Fitzgerald book went for more than the manuscript of a T.S.

03:40.417 --> 03:41.318
Eliot poem.

03:41.338 --> 03:42.179
I can figure that.

03:42.519 --> 03:46.463
And it was just because it was, the gossip

03:47.236 --> 03:52.223
$750 for Ben Johnson's works, for instance.

03:52.243 --> 03:53.184
Yeah.

03:53.204 --> 04:09.145
You know, I just quoted from Joseph the Provider, you know, I thought I'd have a complete Akramila collection, except for Situation Normal, you know, and he just quoted a very nice copy of that book for $550.

04:09.385 --> 04:13.250
I guess, you know, I don't know if they're not going to buy it yet.

04:13.270 --> 04:14.712
Well, they're the top of the line.

04:14.843 --> 04:15.624
I'm sorry?

04:15.704 --> 04:19.990
They have the best books at very high prices, so that's about the outside.

04:20.531 --> 04:35.411
But my point is, we're talking about two playwrights, and the prices for each playwright are about the same.

04:35.431 --> 04:41.779
And this one is 300 years old, and the other one is about 30 years old, about 40 years old.

04:42.991 --> 04:49.859
Of course, a lot of modern collectors now, especially since they are in California and the West, are more modern-oriented when they're collecting.

04:50.440 --> 04:52.683
So they don't collect early books.

04:52.703 --> 04:56.007
They don't collect the classics the way The Gentleman and the Gourley Flux used to.

04:56.167 --> 04:57.248
No.

04:57.509 --> 05:00.432
There is one fellow I'm interviewing in California.

05:00.573 --> 05:01.494
Do you know Bill Self?

05:01.674 --> 05:02.475
Have you ever heard of him?

05:02.495 --> 05:03.616
William Self, I see.

05:03.696 --> 05:03.957
No.

05:05.058 --> 05:06.420
He's a producer.

05:06.620 --> 05:10.324
I saw him at one of the Martin sales when he bought Tamerlane.

05:10.344 --> 05:11.486
Oh, he did, yeah.

05:11.506 --> 05:12.407
He spoke to his wife.

05:13.180 --> 05:15.143
and an older guy.

05:15.483 --> 05:21.632
I went up and introduced him, and I said, yeah, I'd love to talk to you.

05:21.652 --> 05:22.133
I called him.

05:22.153 --> 05:24.517
He has 20, he collects classics.

05:24.657 --> 05:30.926
He has 23 presentations, Dick Dickens presentations, and his vaults.

05:30.946 --> 05:33.189
We have to get together and talk.

05:33.209 --> 05:34.131
In his vault?

05:34.151 --> 05:35.473
He has a vault in his house.

05:35.513 --> 05:37.035
We're talking an L.A.

05:37.095 --> 05:37.335
type.

05:37.455 --> 05:39.238
I mean, these guys have vaults, I guess.

05:39.826 --> 05:45.214
You quite agree that a lot of the action has moved out to the West Coast?

05:47.276 --> 05:47.597
Yes.

05:48.758 --> 05:54.567
Even though there still is money here in the East Coast, why do you think, and we said, of course, there necessarily is money, then, is it?

05:56.930 --> 05:59.934
Maybe all the adventurous people are still going west.

06:00.635 --> 06:02.858
But they are different collectors out there.

06:03.199 --> 06:06.323
I mean, we do have a Barc Curie, for instance, you know, he is.

06:08.227 --> 06:10.389
Well, are there more collecting moderns out there?

06:10.730 --> 06:11.090
I guess.

06:11.390 --> 06:14.294
But then we had Carter Burden, who sustained a trade.

06:14.314 --> 06:14.994
Yeah.

06:15.415 --> 06:19.940
I'll be interviewing him, by the way, in September.

06:19.960 --> 06:22.903
Well, that'll be interesting, because he's... I guess he's not.

06:22.923 --> 06:24.064
Have you sold some off yet?

06:24.084 --> 06:24.205
Yes.

06:24.225 --> 06:27.368
He's sold his Arden collection.

06:27.388 --> 06:28.449
It's odd to sell off.

06:28.549 --> 06:29.731
I just think it's unusual.

06:31.072 --> 06:34.736
Well, I want to... Old-time collectors never would have done a favorite diary of their collections around us.

06:35.917 --> 06:36.478
Maybe he just...

06:38.247 --> 06:40.549
I don't know.

06:40.649 --> 06:43.992
I wonder if it's a quote.

06:45.654 --> 06:48.056
I've never heard of it.

06:48.116 --> 06:48.376
No.

06:49.037 --> 06:51.860
I've just never heard of it.

06:51.980 --> 06:53.921
But there's no such thing.

06:53.941 --> 06:55.683
He's scared by that.

06:55.823 --> 07:01.729
Yeah, well... He was scared by that.

07:01.829 --> 07:05.352
But that man had such a straight face, I think.

07:06.462 --> 07:10.486
I shouldn't have sent him to Bill, but that's a good way to get rid of people.

07:10.986 --> 07:28.201
Before I forget, this man, you came in this morning, this old man, and he told me that he had worked for 60 years as a crazier, and he'd done a little slideshow about books and book collectors, 145 pictures of book collectors.

07:29.342 --> 07:36.148
And he apparently has 1,500, he has interviewed and photographed 1,500 collectors.

07:36.331 --> 07:38.113
Is this guy's name?

07:38.133 --> 07:40.577
And they're not just book collectors, but they're collectors.

07:40.597 --> 07:49.028
And he says his mission in life, he's quite a smart old man, to try to persuade people to become collectors because collectors were happy people.

07:49.869 --> 08:00.664
And he was very articulate, and I really think that you could... Lawrence, it sounds like he could fit into my category with the... I told you about the literary detective.

08:00.764 --> 08:01.205
Yes.

08:01.525 --> 08:03.047
He's a really interesting guy.

08:03.398 --> 08:07.766
Well, this man, I told him that you were coming in, so he would know.

08:07.867 --> 08:09.129
So he'd be interested to talk to you?

08:09.149 --> 08:10.271
Yes, I would love to talk.

08:10.291 --> 08:15.882
And really, if anyone's taken 1,200 pictures and talked to 1,200 people in Europe and all around the world.

08:15.902 --> 08:16.804
How did he find all these collections?

08:16.824 --> 08:21.312
Well, you see, he was an art appraiser, an artifact appraiser.

08:21.392 --> 08:25.440
So he's been in the same apartment in Washington for 62 years.

08:25.927 --> 08:27.049
But I guess he traveled the world.

08:27.089 --> 08:29.452
I didn't have an extensive conversation with him.

08:29.472 --> 08:30.513
How old would you say he is?

08:30.533 --> 08:31.695
Oh, late 70s.

08:31.715 --> 08:36.542
I've had some wonderful interviews with people who are artichans.

08:36.582 --> 08:38.565
Yes.

08:38.745 --> 08:39.806
Well, he was quite bright.

08:39.847 --> 08:40.748
He wanted me to come see him.

08:40.768 --> 08:43.712
Appraiser Art Antiques with his photograph on the back of the car.

08:44.093 --> 08:45.535
A lively thought.

08:45.555 --> 08:51.082
But I think you might get some interesting things from him.

08:51.683 --> 08:52.244
Thank you.

08:52.384 --> 08:55.849
Let's talk a little bit about...

08:56.690 --> 09:06.183
I've heard you describe some of the festivals, quite many people have come in, that you deal in literature as obviously older books.

09:06.984 --> 09:10.569
You collect other types of things, is that right?

09:11.891 --> 09:15.476
We actually have other books.

09:15.496 --> 09:19.482
Because I didn't believe Roger had written about it.

09:20.523 --> 09:21.364
Is there a focus?

09:22.606 --> 09:23.227
My collection?

09:23.567 --> 09:25.650
Neither the store nor my collection have been focused.

09:26.035 --> 09:29.420
We bought the Phoenix Bookstore, for instance, the stock.

09:29.560 --> 09:29.940
Oh, you did?

09:29.960 --> 09:31.002
Yes, and that's upstairs.

09:31.022 --> 09:32.824
We have three apartments full of books upstairs.

09:33.004 --> 09:33.725
When did you do that?

09:33.986 --> 09:34.847
Oh, last year.

09:35.127 --> 09:37.490
It was so first in one dealer down here, and then we bought it.

09:38.292 --> 09:42.677
So we have actually an apartment full of modern poetry and modern literature.

09:42.697 --> 09:44.940
We bought another bookstore in Long Island.

09:45.401 --> 09:48.425
So we have a lot of moderns.

09:48.445 --> 09:49.927
You bought the stock in the United States?

09:50.388 --> 09:50.488
Yeah.

09:50.528 --> 09:52.791
You operate how many bookstores?

09:52.811 --> 09:53.752
Three.

09:53.973 --> 09:54.253
Four.

09:55.870 --> 09:56.471
One here.

09:57.012 --> 10:01.118
One in Dallas, one in Houston, and one in Archer City, Tennessee.

10:01.138 --> 10:04.002
We really must sell this disaster.

10:04.022 --> 10:06.245
Oh, correct.

10:06.265 --> 10:06.585
Excuse me.

10:07.186 --> 10:10.131
What's that on?

10:10.731 --> 10:11.272
No, I don't know.

10:11.593 --> 10:13.395
But we've got this.

10:13.415 --> 10:16.560
Did you find a bill?

10:16.580 --> 10:24.932
What part did you want to take that study of women book collectors or the lack thereof?

10:25.958 --> 10:28.541
I have been observing for 20 years in the store.

10:29.322 --> 10:31.184
Men and women come into the store.

10:31.204 --> 10:33.727
All ages, all colors, all sizes.

10:33.747 --> 10:39.353
And the men have an immediate response to the bookshelves.

10:39.393 --> 10:44.119
And I'm talking about 14-year-old black boys, young boys, middle-aged people, old people.

10:44.860 --> 10:53.890
The women and the girls almost invariably look at the antiques, sit down, and then they

10:54.477 --> 10:55.879
They can't stay in here very long.

10:55.939 --> 10:59.423
They usually go to antique stores across the state.

10:59.443 --> 11:00.784
Very intelligent looking people.

11:01.325 --> 11:02.907
I haven't found any pattern in it.

11:03.768 --> 11:06.491
And so it's just, it's irritating.

11:07.372 --> 11:09.615
It's embarrassing me, basically, for all these years.

11:09.635 --> 11:10.856
I couldn't understand it.

11:12.058 --> 11:16.102
It's an instinctive, proprietary feeling that men seem to have.

11:18.345 --> 11:21.649
It's comfortable in this manner.

11:22.608 --> 11:29.881
I had considered it a myth that women are book collectors.

11:30.703 --> 11:35.010
But here you are, a woman bookseller, and all of a sudden you're agreeing with a lot of things.

11:35.050 --> 11:37.134
Oh, I was upset at finding that to be true.

11:38.457 --> 11:42.003
And I can't tell you how many times I've done it.

11:42.023 --> 11:43.586
Only 20 times in 20 years.

11:44.628 --> 11:47.012
A wonderful woman arrives and lives in California.

11:47.498 --> 11:53.324
Nineteenth-century, eighteenth-century literature by women, and we have a lot of that sweet-efforts and things upstairs.

11:53.344 --> 11:54.004
She went upstairs.

11:54.745 --> 11:55.566
She had a list.

11:55.606 --> 11:56.827
She spent $2,000.

11:56.867 --> 11:58.789
She bought them, sent them to her.

11:59.029 --> 11:59.690
That never happened.

11:59.810 --> 12:00.871
Older woman, younger woman?

12:01.051 --> 12:02.673
Middle-aged woman.

12:02.693 --> 12:16.206
At the Bradley Martin sale, a lot of little interesting stories developed, you know, made a really pretty young woman, and I would say young one.

12:17.114 --> 12:20.438
He's a dealer collector.

12:20.719 --> 12:23.502
Very, very smart young man.

12:24.724 --> 12:31.332
And active and knowledgeable in the trade and much more intellectual authority.

12:31.352 --> 12:34.736
That's my one ever since college.

12:34.836 --> 12:35.117
I know.

12:35.137 --> 12:36.518
I have to give another one next year.

12:36.538 --> 12:37.900
I have to think of another.

12:37.960 --> 12:41.805
I mean, I'm going to shamelessly follow some of your needs here.

12:42.173 --> 12:47.480
Well, I tell you, I got some of those leaves from John Gatch.

12:48.321 --> 12:50.023
You know who he is?

12:50.083 --> 12:50.443
G-A-C-H.

12:50.644 --> 12:53.047
He is an ABA dealer in psychology.

12:53.347 --> 12:55.530
He is a self-made man.

12:55.650 --> 12:57.072
He is a self-educated man.

12:57.212 --> 12:58.774
He is totally crazy.

12:59.895 --> 13:01.037
Where is his guy at?

13:01.257 --> 13:04.461
Well, Maryland.

13:04.561 --> 13:05.683
John Gatch.

13:05.703 --> 13:08.346
In fact, I don't even think I sent him the copy.

13:08.426 --> 13:11.590
He's the one that told me that women were collected...

13:12.295 --> 13:14.437
They're not.

13:14.898 --> 13:16.440
Didn't collect it because they were collected.

13:17.161 --> 13:17.721
Here.

13:17.921 --> 13:21.506
Do you subscribe to that, by the way?

13:22.707 --> 13:26.231
Oh, I think historically, yes, it makes a little sense, yeah.

13:26.531 --> 13:27.813
They certainly are still being used.

13:27.893 --> 13:32.238
Women have been regarded as... What?

13:34.420 --> 13:35.261
Twenty for that.

13:35.461 --> 13:36.142
And this one?

13:36.182 --> 13:37.904
Oh, good.

13:38.024 --> 13:41.188
Okay.

13:41.675 --> 13:44.240
But he talked to me on the phone for an hour.

13:44.260 --> 13:47.786
About the psychology of collective discipline.

13:47.886 --> 13:49.569
Have you studied on the psychology?

13:49.589 --> 13:49.649
No.

13:49.669 --> 13:51.051
Do you know what he called for?

13:51.733 --> 13:52.053
Sure.

13:53.376 --> 13:54.658
Oh, Lisa.

13:54.958 --> 13:55.259
Lisa.

13:56.281 --> 13:56.481
Lisa.

13:56.521 --> 13:59.126
Have you studied that you know on the psychology of collective discipline?

13:59.146 --> 14:01.209
No, you see, Freud, he was such a strange guy.

14:01.770 --> 14:05.016
That's why I got so disgusted with that one who had the eye popping.

14:05.215 --> 14:32.353
um that was one of the few things that i found and then that's that very very funny study comparing the boys and girls and you said cliche after cliche he would like nothing more than to i'm going to retire

14:32.941 --> 14:36.285
Aren't you going to sit on your mountaintop and sell books?

14:37.948 --> 14:41.372
I don't know.

14:41.432 --> 14:41.893
I don't know.

14:41.913 --> 14:43.855
Bill's been in business despite his age.

14:43.896 --> 14:46.299
He's been in business for, what, 40 or 50 years now?

14:46.319 --> 14:46.920
30.

14:47.580 --> 14:48.902
He was a child when he opened.

14:48.922 --> 14:49.483
20, 19?

14:49.523 --> 14:51.806
20.

14:51.826 --> 15:02.340
Tell me a bit about, you've loved books all your life.

15:02.624 --> 15:05.128
You inherit a lot of books.

15:05.168 --> 15:12.860
How do you feel that that's how you break this pattern that you write about in this essay?

15:12.880 --> 15:22.795
Well, I was just kind of, you know, retiring, escape into books type, but a lot of people are, and a lot of women are, and they don't necessarily collect, but my grandfather is out, never mind.

15:22.815 --> 15:24.217
They do not have light nor air.

15:24.378 --> 15:26.060
Could you name your grandfather, please?

15:26.120 --> 15:27.923
I don't think you named him in this essay.

15:30.704 --> 15:35.990
Yes, he's very famous, and a third of his collection is in Texas, though.

15:36.010 --> 15:39.173
I made a chapter in Texas, I think I mentioned this one.

15:43.058 --> 15:47.583
Yes, there's a biography of him.

15:47.603 --> 15:53.349
By the way, my aunt and his son, Junior, actually also collected.

15:53.449 --> 15:54.170
I mentioned him.

15:54.711 --> 15:56.593
Did you mention what he collected?

15:56.962 --> 16:14.151
Grandfather had a history of science collection, which was just fabulous, and he bought them all in the 20s and 30s, and he would happen to have struck oil during his depression, so he was able to— Merrily struck oil?

16:14.592 --> 16:15.673
Yes, he's an oil man.

16:15.714 --> 16:19.119
He's called the father of petroleum geology.

16:20.782 --> 16:21.383
Really?

16:21.734 --> 16:25.661
So he was rich when everyone else was poor, which is such a nice way.

16:25.681 --> 16:28.646
And then the history of science books were very cheap anyway.

16:28.666 --> 16:30.208
He had Copernicus.

16:30.228 --> 16:33.494
And so that collection is at the University of Oklahoma.

16:34.616 --> 16:37.140
And that's a very fun history of science collection.

16:37.440 --> 16:38.402
And that's been added to.

16:38.422 --> 16:44.873
And his literature is at the University of Texas.

16:46.152 --> 16:47.794
It's not just Southwestern history.

16:47.834 --> 16:53.239
It really is all of Western Americana, Central American exploration, early settling in.

16:53.339 --> 16:54.360
Where did he live?

16:54.380 --> 16:54.720
Dallas.

16:55.381 --> 16:56.482
Your grandfather was in Dallas.

16:56.522 --> 16:56.843
Dallas, yeah.

16:56.863 --> 16:57.784
Are you from Texas as well?

16:57.804 --> 17:01.848
Well, I was born there, but I grew up here in the age of one, so I'm not really.

17:02.228 --> 17:05.131
And his son collected, has a large train collection.

17:05.731 --> 17:07.193
He added to the other collection.

17:07.613 --> 17:09.555
But my aunt just called me yesterday.

17:09.595 --> 17:12.098
Also, pornography, which I didn't know about.

17:12.698 --> 17:15.501
But he only collected erotica that was

17:17.202 --> 17:24.635
heterosexual erotica between white Anglo-Saxons.

17:24.655 --> 17:40.965
But he also collected Russian... my uncle, Everett Lee de Gallia, Jr., and my aunt just called me yesterday, and she's decided that the Russian books, which include letters from the tsar to his mistress, untranslated, she's decided to sell them.

17:41.283 --> 17:44.527
because she's mad at SMU anyway, and it doesn't sit in their libraries.

17:44.767 --> 17:50.975
So Larry's going to look at them Monday, and somebody else is going to look at them too.

17:50.995 --> 17:52.678
And so that Russian stuff, I don't know what it is.

17:52.998 --> 17:57.484
We would love it, and we would love early travel books is one thing that we like.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.847
Travel is really big.

17:59.927 --> 18:00.628
Yeah.

18:00.648 --> 18:10.260
And early... Anyway, we're talking about... So you grew up... Well, my grandfather helped me get books

18:10.527 --> 18:14.673
When I was reading Anne of Green Gables, he helped me get all the books by L.M.

18:14.713 --> 18:15.234
Montgomery.

18:15.815 --> 18:22.826
And so I sort of got into the habit, and I used to read the way Joe here reads, which is to read everything by somebody.

18:22.846 --> 18:24.849
My daughter's a little bit.

18:24.869 --> 18:31.579
Well, I read, and it took me 25 years to get all of her books, because she actually wrote a lot of books, and some of them are very difficult to find.

18:32.661 --> 18:36.627
And actually, now they're all being reprinted, finally.

18:36.647 --> 18:38.610
Did you go into a few books?

18:38.928 --> 18:41.792
No, but now they're... Somebody did.

18:41.812 --> 18:42.513
Very nicely illustrated.

18:42.653 --> 18:43.574
It really horrified.

18:43.614 --> 18:49.082
Books that I think of as being so rare that are now out there in paperback.

18:49.102 --> 18:50.924
How old were you when you started collecting these?

18:51.124 --> 18:52.026
Oh, 12 and 13.

18:52.046 --> 18:52.366
Really?

18:52.466 --> 18:54.889
And it was a collect... You considered yourself a collector?

18:55.030 --> 18:55.771
No, I didn't.

18:56.952 --> 19:08.007
No, the great moment came when I was at Vassar, and I went into... I went to the House of Books, which was owned by Margie Cohn, who was one of the great lady booksellers.

19:08.527 --> 19:12.072
She'd still be alive if she hadn't looked the wrong way in London.

19:12.412 --> 19:14.895
She'd be 98, but she would still be a dealer.

19:15.797 --> 19:19.802
And because I was reading Virginia Woolf, and I bought from her.

19:19.882 --> 19:30.075
But the first book I bought, I was going to give to Madeira School, my alma mater, because I thought I never thought I could buy something and keep it.

19:30.216 --> 19:31.898
I just wanted it, and I thought I would give it away.

19:31.938 --> 19:36.384
And then this wonderful light bulb went on my head that said, I don't have to give this book away.

19:36.404 --> 19:37.285
I can keep it.

19:37.653 --> 19:40.556
So I kept them ever since, what I could buy.

19:41.478 --> 19:43.880
What prompted the interest of Little Orphan Annie?

19:45.462 --> 19:50.969
Oh, I just started reading it in college, and I had no idea how right-wing Little Orphan Annie was.

19:50.989 --> 19:52.711
It was just absurd.

19:53.212 --> 19:56.716
So I just collected Annie, because I was a liberal.

19:58.758 --> 20:01.081
She was a little fascist, because it amused me.

20:01.101 --> 20:04.285
You see, my sense of humor has, unfortunately,

20:04.754 --> 20:07.799
set the tone for many of my collections.

20:07.819 --> 20:10.203
I'm curious, but what is that collection of books?

20:10.323 --> 20:20.720
Oh, it's books and little, you know, cups and dolls and signet rings, Dakota rings, everything.

20:20.780 --> 20:21.862
All the big little books.

20:21.902 --> 20:24.366
Could you say this is the preeminent little Arcanetti collection?

20:25.240 --> 20:26.141
It's pretty good.

20:26.221 --> 20:28.144
Joe the Pro keeps offering to sell it for me.

20:28.604 --> 20:34.572
In fact, I should have given it to them before the movie, because the movie was such a bust that I think the whole little orphan any market dropped.

20:35.373 --> 20:39.419
And then I was getting ready to sell it again to my own daughter, who shows no interest in rare books at all.

20:40.400 --> 20:42.463
She said, oh no, don't sell that.

20:42.503 --> 20:48.631
It's taking up a lot of space, and I no longer... How old is your daughter?

20:48.651 --> 20:48.711
26.

20:48.731 --> 20:51.094
She reads books, but she likes new, clean books.

20:51.114 --> 20:54.859
I think she spent too many, like Larry's son, too many...

20:55.278 --> 20:58.363
hours waiting in book stories.

20:58.383 --> 21:08.217
I wonder whether it no longer goes down generationally or whether it's just that so few people younger than a certain age have any interest at all.

21:08.237 --> 21:14.567
No, I think one of the things I'm developing is that the generational collections are really the exception.

21:14.627 --> 21:16.990
I went to Shady's place.

21:17.010 --> 21:17.571
I was in Christy.

21:18.212 --> 21:19.474
He's the third generation.

21:19.895 --> 21:22.078
His grandfather was an oil man.

21:22.649 --> 21:24.551
You know, that's the source of the Shady fortune.

21:24.752 --> 21:25.132
Oh, is it?

21:25.172 --> 21:27.975
His grandfather was the guy who discovered oil in Pennsylvania.

21:27.995 --> 21:29.437
Spindletop or whatever.

21:29.597 --> 21:32.641
Yeah, like Titus.

21:32.661 --> 21:32.761
Yeah.

21:32.781 --> 21:37.206
And the guy was incredibly wealthy by the time he was 42 and he started collecting books.

21:37.687 --> 21:41.912
And this colored Shady is the greatest collector of them all.

21:41.932 --> 21:43.634
I mean, you really know it.

21:43.654 --> 21:44.916
That is, it's amazing.

21:44.936 --> 21:50.142
I sat with him for four hours, really, and we canceled pinpointings by our single week.

21:50.459 --> 21:53.984
He just got so energized by these books and so excited by it.

21:54.004 --> 21:57.008
He took out the Gutenberg Bible and put it on the lap, you know?

21:57.489 --> 21:57.810
Oh, really?

21:57.990 --> 21:59.212
And I got life in it.

21:59.332 --> 22:00.994
You know, I really can't make it.

22:01.014 --> 22:02.156
This is a great moment.

22:02.176 --> 22:03.798
That's something you don't get to do with, right?

22:03.818 --> 22:04.699
You know, that's what he said.

22:04.719 --> 22:08.224
You have to feel we're tight, thick papers in the forest.

22:08.325 --> 22:12.130
I checked my machine to make sure I got that quote done.

22:12.110 --> 22:15.193
Makes it very motto, doesn't it?

22:15.213 --> 22:15.713
He did it so well.

22:15.773 --> 22:17.154
That's the incredible thing.

22:17.174 --> 22:19.056
Yeah, he showed me the little holes.

22:19.356 --> 22:21.558
Look, it's something about first times.

22:21.758 --> 22:23.600
And in this case, it really was true.

22:23.620 --> 22:24.421
The first was the best.

22:24.441 --> 22:25.101
The first was the best.

22:25.121 --> 22:27.704
Except that his theory is that it really wasn't the first.

22:27.724 --> 22:29.545
Well, it really wasn't.

22:29.665 --> 22:38.593
And he has a 32-line biblical tract after he went through the whole thing with me, showing how they file down the peas.

22:38.613 --> 22:39.094
OK.

22:40.155 --> 22:40.615
What am I going to do?

22:40.949 --> 23:05.050
you do you cover so much in your essay of course that uh i don't want to ask you questions it's really already answered that's good i haven't read it again is that in english or is that in french did you have to translate oh i i can't read french it is it's not translated so how did you how were you able to uh

23:05.350 --> 23:08.193
I guess I was quoting a translation and got someone to translate it.

23:08.213 --> 23:08.774
I can't remember.

23:08.794 --> 23:10.576
I was just wondering if there is a translation.

23:10.596 --> 23:11.998
No, not that I could not.

23:12.018 --> 23:14.180
I saw that at Harvard and I said I can't read it.

23:14.201 --> 23:15.582
I know, it's very frustrating.

23:15.642 --> 23:17.524
It's a good time.

23:17.544 --> 23:18.486
It's stupid.

23:18.526 --> 23:23.091
But that sounds like, I love that Mary Richardson, is it color?

23:23.932 --> 23:24.613
Oh, yes.

23:24.673 --> 23:26.495
Connection, the Bronte thing.

23:26.595 --> 23:27.176
Yes, that's a fun.

23:27.216 --> 23:30.920
What do you think?

23:30.940 --> 23:32.502
This?

23:32.522 --> 23:34.024
We don't have any tissue paper doing it.

23:35.084 --> 23:38.207
This man from... Speak.

23:38.227 --> 23:38.387
Speak.

23:38.407 --> 23:39.969
I can't speak.

23:40.049 --> 23:42.651
The man from... Oh, I see.

23:42.691 --> 23:44.793
The man from Princeton wanted tissue paper.

23:45.855 --> 23:49.838
We don't have any tissue paper to put around.

23:50.259 --> 23:50.839
Back on again.

23:50.959 --> 23:52.281
Oh.

23:52.301 --> 23:56.405
I keep using my... You should write something from him.

23:56.445 --> 23:59.047
He would love it, right?

23:59.188 --> 24:00.609
Oh, dear.

24:00.629 --> 24:02.991
Well, you can always use another pair of bookends.

24:03.011 --> 24:03.792
That's just...

24:04.548 --> 24:12.318
You did mention that you made the transition from a modest impulse to modest mania.

24:12.338 --> 24:16.042
Would you say that you are a bibliomaniacal person?

24:16.883 --> 24:17.304
Not really.

24:17.404 --> 24:18.145
I can't say that.

24:18.565 --> 24:23.371
Because being in the store, I'm in a controlled situation.

24:23.932 --> 24:25.934
Because I used to take books home from the store.

24:27.136 --> 24:30.420
And then I discovered that if you kept them for a few years,

24:30.653 --> 24:32.315
You didn't need to have them anymore.

24:32.335 --> 24:32.936
Some of them.

24:32.956 --> 24:34.417
It's a very interesting rent.

24:34.438 --> 24:36.941
Then I bring it back to the store, and they would have doubled in value.

24:37.081 --> 24:40.044
You know, Cullen Franklin says precisely the same thing.

24:40.084 --> 24:41.366
He is an collector.

24:41.386 --> 24:42.968
He buys, essentially, for himself.

24:44.169 --> 24:46.111
And he doesn't put prices on the books.

24:47.693 --> 24:48.695
They arrive at a price.

24:50.397 --> 24:56.644
But basically, you go into his barn, his book barn, at Cullen, and these are his books.

24:57.350 --> 24:59.993
If you want to buy it, you can buy it.

25:00.013 --> 25:00.954
You can enjoy it.

25:00.974 --> 25:01.835
That's exactly what Bill mentioned.

25:01.855 --> 25:04.459
He locked up a lot of his books.

25:04.479 --> 25:05.640
What do you collect, Bill?

25:05.700 --> 25:06.521
What's that?

25:07.082 --> 25:11.988
Bill's collection.

25:12.028 --> 25:20.979
The collection I'm really quite passionate about is books and the ways that you're liking to do with.

25:22.901 --> 25:26.125
Most of these visual artists and artists that were

25:27.387 --> 25:35.736
Up to the point of the Napoleonic dispersion.

25:36.196 --> 25:37.477
Fine arts theory.

25:37.497 --> 25:38.799
Do you sell these things?

25:39.579 --> 25:41.742
Well, that's the problem.

25:41.762 --> 25:42.723
I'm not a pure collector.

25:43.003 --> 25:44.144
I'm certainly not a figure.

25:44.164 --> 25:47.107
I sold some things like that.

25:47.968 --> 25:54.795
I can't afford to really collect them.

25:55.484 --> 26:02.472
I can't afford to collect on a scale where I'd like to collect.

26:02.492 --> 26:04.334
So I have niggled a way into a reasonably good little collection, which, you know, converts.

26:06.957 --> 26:08.338
Well, actually, you've been here, what, 20 years?

26:08.719 --> 26:10.801
We've been in business for 20 years, yeah.

26:10.821 --> 26:11.642
At this location or anywhere?

26:11.662 --> 26:11.762
Yeah.

26:12.923 --> 26:17.168
That little, that store on the right, the one door and the one window was our first shop.

26:18.690 --> 26:20.972
And then we, this came up for rent, and we rented this.

26:21.573 --> 26:25.137
And then we, this came up for rent, and books just breed anyway.

26:25.285 --> 26:27.668
and slowly we've taken over, we have three apartments upstairs.

26:28.489 --> 26:30.612
Now, would you describe yourself as a Washingtonian?

26:31.253 --> 26:31.753
Oh, sure.

26:32.434 --> 26:38.422
Is that how you and Larry put that?

26:38.482 --> 26:43.268
Oh, later on in life, yes, I was living in Houston.

26:43.288 --> 26:44.330
But you also grew up here.

26:44.350 --> 26:45.611
But I grew up in Washington.

26:45.631 --> 26:52.440
Oh, yes, he was running a bookshop when I met him.

26:52.707 --> 27:03.480
As a trade, I suppose so.

27:03.500 --> 27:08.005
But I really don't want to speak for him.

27:08.105 --> 27:21.381
He's in a special, he's in a very unusual position now because he can't be treated normally by most dealers who sell him.

27:22.103 --> 27:40.269
We get catalogs from Joseph, the provider, and we've known certainly Larry Moskowitz for 20 years, and they always have something that one of Larry's early friends sold to them, either letters or books inscribed to his old friends.

27:40.289 --> 27:47.880
And it's a very awkward relationship, and I can't help but look on a collected thing.

27:48.601 --> 27:51.064
But the trade has changed, and he really

27:51.550 --> 27:53.772
has been in the trade for 25, 30 years.

27:54.473 --> 28:11.072
And it's part of the old-fashioned... Without speaking for him, but he does seem to have some bad feelings about the British booksellers.

28:11.212 --> 28:11.973
Well, I don't know.

28:11.993 --> 28:19.161
Some of our friends, certainly Hayward Hill, our best customers are British.

28:19.664 --> 28:21.606
and he doesn't really see them.

28:21.626 --> 28:25.110
And he doesn't like England, for sure, but that's a different matter.

28:25.690 --> 28:26.071
No, no.

28:26.411 --> 28:36.221
I don't know that... I can't speak about his being disillusioned by the book, Craig, because I'm not sure.

28:36.802 --> 28:45.571
I think he feels oppressed in general by people.

28:45.951 --> 28:47.713
They regard him differently.

28:50.461 --> 28:55.286
He said he still loves buying and selling books.

28:55.586 --> 28:58.970
And bookstores.

28:59.730 --> 29:17.469
Yes, he's unpacking those.

29:17.769 --> 29:17.869
Sure.

29:18.760 --> 29:40.270
I guess you share the same interest in the kinds of books that you like to buy and sell like that.

29:40.470 --> 29:41.912
Is that a fair?

29:41.932 --> 29:43.254
Well, we're not really very interested.

29:43.274 --> 29:45.477
We just buy all the good books that are offered.

29:45.676 --> 29:46.918
And that's the game.

29:46.938 --> 30:00.639
There's so many more booksellers around than there used to be in this city and everything.

30:00.659 --> 30:04.044
So the hardest part of bookselling is buying good books.

30:04.064 --> 30:07.550
So if we get offered a maritime collection, we'll buy it.

30:07.790 --> 30:09.793
We've never had a lot of poetry, but we...

30:10.330 --> 30:19.339
This must be an interesting town.

30:19.659 --> 30:24.324
How would you rate this as a rare book town?

30:24.865 --> 30:25.626
Very poorly.

30:26.066 --> 30:26.326
Really?

30:26.346 --> 30:30.591
I mean, it's been a good, more or less, most of these years it's been a good source of books.

30:30.611 --> 30:33.734
Now there's a great number of young booksellers in Washington.

30:33.754 --> 30:35.916
But for a while there, there were only two or three of us.

30:36.385 --> 30:38.768
and we didn't have much competition.

30:38.788 --> 30:44.395
And there are a lot of books in these houses, but there are not a lot of people in these houses buying books.

30:44.415 --> 30:47.439
And this is the memo center of the universe.

30:47.599 --> 30:52.545
And so we sell most of our books to dealers passing food here.

30:52.565 --> 30:58.072
Do you think because it's not a very, it's kind of a rootless city?

30:58.092 --> 30:58.593
I hate to use that.

30:58.613 --> 30:59.614
Well, it's a government city.

30:59.654 --> 31:04.300
We do have Georgetown University, and we have Dunbarton Oaks, and we have the National Gallery.

31:04.735 --> 31:10.442
and a lot of scholars in this town, and they are customers, yeah.

31:11.744 --> 31:20.475
But the ordinary politicians and bureaucrats, not surprisingly, not collectors.

31:20.495 --> 31:30.448
So where would you say you see, we don't do most of your business, your clients aren't really... No, they're not, they're dealers.

31:30.468 --> 31:31.249
And they come from

31:31.685 --> 31:32.086
England.

31:32.607 --> 31:35.875
I come from New York, and again, California.

31:35.895 --> 31:41.689
Did I also say that you didn't collect books on bibliography, or collectors' book collection?

31:41.710 --> 31:42.391
Oh, sure.

31:42.411 --> 31:47.243
You have to, even privately, you have to build up a reference.

31:47.263 --> 31:48.867
It's like reading cookbooks, though.

31:49.252 --> 31:52.275
Yeah, everyone does that.

31:52.295 --> 31:59.622
It reads to me that this is something you've been thinking of for a long time, this particular subject.

31:59.642 --> 32:00.502
Well, I did actually.

32:00.543 --> 32:05.267
It's the only thing I've put a lot of thought into, perhaps in my life.

32:05.627 --> 32:08.930
But I've had that puzzle for 20 years, and then I had to make this paper.

32:09.351 --> 32:16.137
And I joined this group because I was scared of public speaking and scared of writing, so I managed to come.

32:16.285 --> 32:19.971
to accomplish both in one by making myself do something.

32:19.991 --> 32:21.393
And so I made myself think.

32:22.255 --> 32:24.418
I wish I could do it well.

32:24.478 --> 32:29.767
Do you think, have you answered in your own mind as a puzzle answers for you?

32:29.988 --> 32:32.552
Oh, no, you could write a whole other paper probably and have another theory.

32:32.572 --> 32:35.857
But I felt right about a lot of those theories.

32:36.198 --> 32:36.518
I do.

32:38.141 --> 32:38.922
I mean, it can't be.

32:40.164 --> 32:43.069
It's a conditioned thing, not a thing.

32:44.720 --> 32:47.863
It's an innate sexual difference.

32:47.883 --> 32:53.549
But I have really seen, and we have seen a lot of, as well as the indifference of women, real hostility.

32:54.370 --> 32:56.572
Have you seen all these things?

32:56.592 --> 33:03.058
The bored woman in the bookstore, and... It seems like a police ambulance has risen so far.

33:03.078 --> 33:03.639
It's very strange.

33:03.659 --> 33:09.965
I've seen young boys, street boys come in, and they're not afraid and they're interested.

33:09.985 --> 33:13.849
They want to know what's on their shelves.

33:14.234 --> 33:18.540
But do you subscribe to that?

33:18.560 --> 33:27.172
We were discussing it, I guess, in the interview, but do you subscribe to that assertion that because women had been collected as objects?

33:27.512 --> 33:31.878
Oh, that's a sort of facile beginning of a thought.

33:35.283 --> 33:40.550
I'm told, by the way, that Jackie O was a pretty good book collector.

33:40.570 --> 33:41.271
To follow that,

33:42.263 --> 33:48.052
Not that I'm asking you to comment on that, but I just am told that she's... Well, she's made no presents in the trade.

33:48.472 --> 33:51.958
I don't know, unless she has one person applying her.

33:52.058 --> 34:00.170
I was told by a woman deal about it, right, who I really expect.

34:00.411 --> 34:03.615
Well, she'll never talk to you, but she's a collector.

34:03.635 --> 34:06.500
What would she come up with?

34:06.600 --> 34:10.566
Well, you know her great friend, for instance, Sonny Mellon, that's fabulous.

34:10.765 --> 34:37.110
collection of garden books really beautiful beautiful that's a genuine collection and i think i bet i bet she maybe that's part of what she could just find a period certainly she would find it less than amenable to to go out in public and i think that she would only go there

34:37.934 --> 34:44.481
if she really were interested in seeing what was around, except to make maybe a three minute turn.

34:44.501 --> 34:47.384
It's not like that.

34:47.444 --> 34:52.969
So there must, I think there must be an interest there without knowing you needed to say this.

34:52.989 --> 35:01.658
I raised it for one, I'll wait until I thought she was up for the phone.

35:01.778 --> 35:03.520
That one.

35:03.955 --> 35:21.657
It would be a curious disclosure, because if anybody epitomizes the female object in the last 25 years, I mean, Onassis... Well, maybe she's in the tradition of the 18th century collectors, who assimilated the power symbols of the male.

35:21.697 --> 35:26.522
Onassis made no bones about the fact that she was the ultimate possession.

35:26.542 --> 35:28.525
Yes, you're right, she was.

35:28.545 --> 35:32.730
But those French mistresses collect people, because they knew that the king...

35:33.250 --> 35:35.253
and that that was part of their tower.

35:35.974 --> 35:42.843
Where was I just reading, I mean, in detail about Catherine de' Medici and Henry II?

35:42.863 --> 35:49.171
I mean, a book that he would give to the mistress, he would put a different binding or a different seal.

35:49.371 --> 35:51.334
One to the wife would have a different one.

35:51.354 --> 35:58.043
You know, I mean, there's all this kind of language in the bindings that, but you have quite a few interesting.

35:58.063 --> 36:01.367
You have at least four women there who are kind of connected in a circle.

36:01.769 --> 36:02.950
of collectors.

36:02.970 --> 36:03.511
That's fascinating.

36:03.551 --> 36:06.154
That's why I wish this thing were in English and not French.

36:06.174 --> 36:06.455
I know.

36:06.475 --> 36:08.357
It's very frustrating.

36:09.118 --> 36:12.242
I love your title, loosely borrowed from Carter and Pollard, by the way.

36:12.402 --> 36:12.662
Yes.

36:12.742 --> 36:14.404
Did they use the same title here?

36:14.504 --> 36:14.704
Yes.

36:15.666 --> 36:16.587
I should hope so.

36:16.667 --> 36:19.110
I mean, of all the people that would know what that meant.

36:19.250 --> 36:21.132
Nobody I was addressing used my reference.

36:22.914 --> 36:27.960
I have a first mint copy of that book.

36:28.080 --> 36:30.223
In researching this book, by the way,

36:30.423 --> 36:36.589
pleasant by-products of a lovely collection of, you know, auction catalogs.

36:37.550 --> 36:38.531
Well, what did you collect there?

36:38.551 --> 36:40.513
You said you bought some things at the Martin Center.

36:40.533 --> 36:43.656
Well, what I bought is Jacob Blank, you know, his sixth volume.

36:43.676 --> 36:50.382
I bought his Stritic catalog, and I paid $2.50 for that.

36:50.703 --> 36:51.203
Oh, I see.

36:51.243 --> 36:51.884
For the BAL.

36:52.564 --> 36:57.749
But there was one book that did we owe some farmer collection.

36:57.849 --> 36:59.451
We were in a farmer collection in England.

36:59.836 --> 37:00.557
in the 70s.

37:00.637 --> 37:04.302
It's about a 200-year-old catalog of a library.

37:04.783 --> 37:07.326
And that's when Bradley was in silence.

37:07.346 --> 37:08.488
He didn't really have a book plate.

37:08.508 --> 37:14.175
Selthabies made up a book plate for him, which I think is ridiculous.

37:14.195 --> 37:15.597
He's an ancient and dishonorable tradition.

37:15.617 --> 37:16.599
Yeah, a little globe.

37:16.619 --> 37:19.382
But as I said, Bradley Martin didn't have a book plate.

37:20.063 --> 37:23.648
They fabricated a little book plate and put it in some of the books.

37:23.668 --> 37:29.556
In England a few times, it's been done in a slightly more honest way.

37:29.907 --> 37:40.697
Yeah, well, I think they do kind of have a... But it's been tricked up here several times.

37:40.897 --> 37:51.928
In this city, Joseph Herschel, it looks like it's concocted for him by the owner of the local option office, a man whose name I can barely bring myself to now.

37:54.750 --> 37:57.653
Amy Lowell is quite an interesting exception.

37:58.527 --> 38:07.477
Well, not the most feminine of women, but yes, indeed, she was an exception.

38:07.817 --> 38:14.805
But she was a real collector.

38:14.985 --> 38:22.273
Well, I guess her husband started her off, but she sure as hell put the ball in it, yeah.

38:22.760 --> 38:26.465
But the second husband is also a collector, too, right?

38:26.485 --> 38:27.046
Oh, yes.

38:27.066 --> 38:28.448
Well, by then, she is.

38:28.528 --> 38:32.795
Is that the Echols, by the way, that you quoted as one of the same names?

38:32.815 --> 38:33.856
Yes, yes.

38:33.876 --> 38:35.879
There's a collector, by the way.

38:35.959 --> 38:39.344
I did this with Scott Terrow, the presumed innocent guy.

38:39.665 --> 38:40.125
Oh, yes?

38:40.145 --> 38:41.167
Not from my book.

38:41.928 --> 38:46.234
I write for newspapers, so I do offer interviews.

38:46.254 --> 38:52.243
And he said his partner, the 90-year-old guy, and he said he is the preeminent collector in Chicago.

38:52.915 --> 39:00.082
I just bought what was left of his book recently.

39:00.122 --> 39:02.785
But that is interesting, don't you think?

39:02.825 --> 39:04.026
Yes, please.

39:04.347 --> 39:14.917
In fact, somebody said, you've got to, I told us to one of this woman dealer that I've been talking to, she said, yes, you've got to talk to this guy, because he does Mary Hyde very well.

39:15.318 --> 39:17.740
But have you talked to Mary Hyde or Lady Echols?

39:17.780 --> 39:22.365
Lady Echols and I spoke at the Gloria Club, and she

39:22.818 --> 39:24.820
and I wrote a nice long letter.

39:25.561 --> 39:32.388
I mean, she is reluctant to talk to me because she fears security and everything at home.

39:32.408 --> 39:36.012
She doesn't want to talk because she says I can have a lovely letter from her.

39:36.032 --> 39:38.354
Talk to her elsewhere.

39:38.374 --> 39:40.757
No, I mean, I don't mean that I'm a friend.

39:40.777 --> 39:42.479
No, but I mean, she doesn't have to.

39:42.499 --> 39:50.127
But talking about her books and not having a library, and it was always one of a museum specials.

39:50.147 --> 39:52.369
She said she's turned on every request for anything.

39:52.737 --> 39:57.162
I really had two people so far decline, right?

39:57.182 --> 39:58.904
Larry and Michael.

39:58.944 --> 40:04.050
Larry and Michael.

40:04.090 --> 40:15.544
But there's enough on the record about both of them that, I mean, Cadillac Jack up there, I mean, he speaks quite eloquently about his... He wrote me a letter.

40:15.564 --> 40:19.909
What if we said, after having written Cadillac Jack, how much more, what else do I have to say?

40:20.227 --> 40:27.358
which is pretty much the same line.

40:27.378 --> 40:30.042
You know, what about Mark Lasner?

40:30.062 --> 40:31.865
There is a young collector in this city.

40:32.666 --> 40:33.607
He's amazing, yeah.

40:33.948 --> 40:38.254
He's going to be, if he is not already, he's very close to a major collector now.

40:38.274 --> 40:39.056
Who is it?

40:39.076 --> 40:41.159
Mark Samuels Lasner.

40:41.299 --> 40:43.923
Mark Samuels Lasner, L.A.S.S.?

40:45.605 --> 40:47.368
I guess it's L.A.S.S.

40:47.528 --> 40:47.989
going on.

40:48.188 --> 40:49.850
Where is he from?

40:51.793 --> 40:55.218
He's lived in Boston, in Charlottesville, and now Washington.

40:55.238 --> 40:59.224
And I think that he's given evidence of actually settling in here in Washington.

40:59.244 --> 41:01.267
How old do we think he is?

41:01.768 --> 41:02.929
Is he in his 30s?

41:04.011 --> 41:07.756
I don't think Mark must be in the office with him.

41:07.776 --> 41:08.397
But he's young.

41:08.497 --> 41:09.319
He's a collection.

41:09.339 --> 41:10.180
I like his collection.

41:10.260 --> 41:12.323
He knows a lot of people.

41:12.343 --> 41:17.250
He is the forthcoming bibliographer of Max Bierbaum, and he has his building

41:17.905 --> 41:21.070
a collection that could only be compared with... That's right.

41:21.190 --> 41:28.541
On my list of things I'm going to do, and it's not the highest, but you know that Yale gives a prize every year, an undergraduate prize in book collecting.

41:29.803 --> 41:34.150
And I thought that would be kind of interesting to go and find the last five recipients.

41:34.250 --> 41:34.871
Do they have money?

41:35.492 --> 41:36.153
Do they get money?

41:36.995 --> 41:38.617
Because I... There's a little prize here.

41:38.637 --> 41:44.126
I used to judge at George Washington, gave a prize, and it was a thousand for the first prize or whatever.

41:44.146 --> 41:46.309
And most of it, yes, most of the entries...

41:46.627 --> 41:48.469
Tell me a little bit about this.

41:48.489 --> 41:49.210
This is interesting.

41:49.411 --> 41:54.457
Well, most of the entries, you could tell right away, were just hustled together in order to win the $1,000.

41:55.198 --> 41:57.361
The big little book collector.

41:57.942 --> 41:59.844
How did this start?

41:59.864 --> 42:00.265
I don't know.

42:00.305 --> 42:01.707
Somebody left money.

42:01.767 --> 42:03.609
Yes, it was one of those.

42:03.689 --> 42:05.732
I mean, did this person want to start

42:06.016 --> 42:08.358
They wanted to stimulate the book collection.

42:08.558 --> 42:08.839
Yeah.

42:08.959 --> 42:10.140
And so they could give a price.

42:10.200 --> 42:13.303
And most of the collections were fraudulent.

42:13.323 --> 42:15.525
The price was coming at $200.

42:15.585 --> 42:18.267
Well, the first price was $1,000.

42:18.348 --> 42:19.348
You would have done it.

42:19.368 --> 42:21.751
You should have been at GW for it.

42:22.291 --> 42:22.571
Yeah.

42:22.591 --> 42:25.875
You do have a score next door that I've been chewing over all over lunch.

42:25.995 --> 42:26.475
Oh, hello.

42:26.495 --> 42:28.057
Yeah, I'm going to look at it.

42:28.077 --> 42:28.717
Of course.

42:29.038 --> 42:29.818
Is it unlocked?

42:29.958 --> 42:30.999
It's still unlocked.

42:31.019 --> 42:34.683
Do you have any music in your shop?

42:34.823 --> 42:34.943
Music.

42:35.817 --> 42:40.002
He has a shop across the street, so you can go over there afterwards.

42:40.022 --> 42:41.523
Oh, Red Door, William F. Hale books.

42:41.583 --> 42:43.365
He's got some music.

42:44.446 --> 42:44.867
Thank you.

42:44.987 --> 42:46.369
I didn't even know we had any.

42:46.389 --> 42:48.951
What club, by the way, is members and male guests only?

42:49.011 --> 42:50.353
Oh, that was Cosmos Club.

42:50.433 --> 42:53.256
But they've since let women in as members.

42:54.177 --> 42:57.040
I said that because half my audience belonged to the Cosmos Club.

42:58.162 --> 42:59.543
But it was outside the library.

43:00.224 --> 43:00.424
Yes.

43:01.130 --> 43:04.857
which really reinforced the point that you were making.

43:04.877 --> 43:11.248
Yes, you could take women up to the dining room as guests, but they were not allowed in the library.

43:11.268 --> 43:13.572
I presume they allowed them in now that they allowed them as members.

43:13.592 --> 43:15.115
And you refresh my memory.

43:15.155 --> 43:21.166
I didn't realize that Blades had actually included women as one of the great enemies of books.

43:21.186 --> 43:21.687
I mean, that's...

43:22.291 --> 43:25.015
I mean, you know, you're starting with two and a half strikes against me.

43:25.035 --> 43:25.556
I know, yeah.

43:25.596 --> 43:31.405
And then you wonder, I say, all right, you don't want me to collect books in the hell with you.

43:31.425 --> 43:32.286
Water and worms.

43:32.306 --> 43:40.158
Well, that's why this rather defensive, hostile attitude has been a cultural thing.

43:40.178 --> 43:47.229
You do kind of end up in an upbeat... I tried to, but you have a better example than I do.

43:47.289 --> 43:49.492
But that story of that girl is wonderful.

43:49.512 --> 43:51.555
In fact, I might even start a chapter like that, you know.

43:51.788 --> 43:52.909
with that little scene.

43:52.929 --> 43:54.130
I didn't even have to know who she is.

43:55.411 --> 43:56.052
It would be nice.

43:58.734 --> 44:00.516
Let's talk, give me a little background.

44:00.536 --> 44:05.220
When did you decide, how did you become a professional book book?

44:05.240 --> 44:08.983
I mean, you started as a, you loved books for as long as you can remember.

44:09.003 --> 44:10.184
Well, it's like keeping that book.

44:10.224 --> 44:11.666
I thought I was going to have to give away.

44:11.686 --> 44:13.727
I never thought of myself as a book seller.

44:14.568 --> 44:21.154
And actually, I started because Allard Lowenstein got defeated in Congress.

44:21.505 --> 44:35.547
20 years ago, and his AA, who was a friend of mine, and Larry and I started the store together, just impulsively, because that property was up for rent for $125 a month, and we figured we could make $125 a month.

44:35.567 --> 44:39.553
And then we just did it for fun.

44:39.573 --> 44:41.115
20 years ago for $125 a month?

44:42.778 --> 44:43.699
That's not a lot of money.

44:43.814 --> 44:56.915
20 years ago I had an apartment down here when I lived in Washington for a year.

44:57.395 --> 45:01.942
Don't go away, but he always comes in.

45:03.605 --> 45:06.109
So actually that's when he became a professional.

45:06.815 --> 45:12.362
Yeah, and it's just funded to buy books and sell them.

45:12.482 --> 45:20.152
And then John Curtis moved down to Williamsburg, and he has a very beautiful store there now.

45:20.172 --> 45:22.716
What's the name of the store?

45:22.756 --> 45:23.136
The Book Press.

45:23.196 --> 45:34.090
Yeah, and he was, his wife is at Bathurst with me, and he was the Allard Loewenstein AA, and I worked in the office to find it, and I believe it.

45:34.811 --> 45:34.992
Al.

45:35.212 --> 45:36.113
Okay, yeah, I did.

45:36.683 --> 45:40.149
I'm sorry, it seems like I'm jumping around the flag.

45:40.229 --> 45:50.026
But anyway, it was just kind of an impulse, and then pride kept it going because I think we're such a nice story.

45:50.047 --> 45:52.150
We keep it nice.

45:52.170 --> 45:53.052
I'm sorry, you said pride?

45:53.533 --> 45:54.074
Pride, yes.

45:54.394 --> 45:55.075
Pride of shop.

45:55.115 --> 45:55.476
I don't know.

45:55.496 --> 45:57.940
What's the German for that, Bill?

45:57.960 --> 46:00.565
Something.

46:00.950 --> 46:02.452
It's just a lot of fun to buy books.

46:02.832 --> 46:06.577
But did you find the transition difficult from going from a collector?

46:07.218 --> 46:09.801
No, because I checked what I wanted.

46:09.821 --> 46:11.062
Actually, it gave you an opportunity.

46:11.082 --> 46:19.693
And as I said, it checked me, basically, because... Actually, one thing Larry did tell me in one of these letters is that he became a bookseller as one way to get the books.

46:20.274 --> 46:20.654
That's right.

46:20.694 --> 46:22.036
That's what we both did.

46:22.196 --> 46:25.960
But as a consequence, mostly, I don't want rare, rare books anymore.

46:25.980 --> 46:26.902
I don't need them.

46:26.922 --> 46:27.703
You need it for yourself.

46:27.923 --> 46:28.183
Yes.

46:28.784 --> 46:29.725
I have a lot of them.

46:30.481 --> 46:33.206
I buy books to read now, as does he.

46:33.226 --> 46:36.492
He knows how to buy other traditions he cares about.

46:36.512 --> 46:38.014
And I don't know.

46:38.034 --> 46:39.978
You know what happens?

46:40.579 --> 46:42.262
I kind of find that myself, too.

46:42.282 --> 46:48.473
I mean, that... So much, quite interesting made by these modern people, for one thing.

46:48.925 --> 46:52.070
Are you immediately sitting here for a few minutes?

46:52.090 --> 46:53.913
I'll sit here for a few minutes.

46:53.933 --> 46:55.475
Tell me when you want to wrap up, by the way.

46:55.495 --> 46:56.997
Okay, okay.

46:58.219 --> 47:01.264
Can I have a quick look at the store before you close up?

47:01.524 --> 47:05.891
Sure.

47:06.191 --> 47:06.512
You know what?

47:06.552 --> 47:07.834
I'm going to probably call you sometime.

47:07.854 --> 47:09.136
We can finish this on the phone.

47:09.376 --> 47:09.677
Okay.

47:10.198 --> 47:11.760
Because this is kind of a...

47:12.955 --> 47:17.379
It's hard for me to continue to train us.

47:17.400 --> 47:29.792
Well, if you come back to Washington, maybe you'll come back and see my book.

47:29.912 --> 47:33.756
These are the most of them.

47:33.896 --> 47:38.661
We usually kept all the rare books in here, but now we've got some very rare books.

47:39.142 --> 47:40.583
We had very few sets.

47:40.985 --> 47:43.508
I'm still not governed, being guarded.

47:43.549 --> 47:45.271
I have to leave the window online.

47:45.291 --> 47:47.534
It's a very old shop.

47:48.275 --> 47:52.881
You have to take people to them.

47:52.901 --> 47:56.326
So we have some rarities upstairs, but these are all pretty good.

47:56.346 --> 47:59.671
And the next door is a total honor system.

47:59.691 --> 48:01.794
We have bibliography and history of art.

48:01.854 --> 48:03.336
You have some stuff in bibliography?

48:03.376 --> 48:03.656
Yeah.

48:04.057 --> 48:05.659
We should go in and air conditioning.

48:05.774 --> 48:07.897
I may well be that I could be a customer, too.

48:10.200 --> 48:11.662
Why don't you have a look next door, and then I'll take you up.

48:11.803 --> 48:12.283
Good to you.

48:12.303 --> 48:13.525
Yes, is this Mr. Kitchener?

48:13.665 --> 48:15.989
How can you tell?

48:16.149 --> 48:21.156
Mr. Kitchener, my name is Nick Baz Baines, B-A-S-B-A-N-E-S.

48:21.216 --> 48:23.319
I'm calling from Massachusetts.

48:23.800 --> 48:25.943
I was in Washington yesterday, and I

48:26.429 --> 48:28.952
I was waiting for you.

48:28.972 --> 48:29.613
Where you been?

48:29.673 --> 48:32.516
What do you mean waiting for me?

48:32.536 --> 48:34.999
She told me you were going to maybe call me.

48:35.039 --> 48:36.741
You're the collector, Justin.

48:36.761 --> 48:39.124
Well, I'm working on a book on such a subject as collecting.

48:39.144 --> 48:40.106
Well, what could be better?

48:40.126 --> 48:42.048
You're going to have a lot of fun.

48:42.068 --> 48:49.517
Well, I've been having a lot of fun, and I've been traveling to a number of places and talking to some fascinating people.

48:49.717 --> 48:50.418
Absolutely.

48:50.438 --> 48:51.119
You get the greatest.

48:51.139 --> 48:53.181
You're going to have a lot of enjoyment.

48:53.201 --> 48:54.563
How many have you got so far?

48:54.779 --> 48:56.221
Oh, God.

48:56.462 --> 48:59.988
I've probably got 82 hours of tape so far.

49:00.048 --> 49:00.609
Marvelous.

49:00.769 --> 49:01.510
Marvelous.

49:01.570 --> 49:02.512
I've been to England.

49:02.532 --> 49:03.073
I've been to France.

49:03.193 --> 49:06.759
I've been to Bill Scheide's place out in Princeton, New Jersey.

49:06.919 --> 49:10.465
He's a fellow that owns a Gutenberg Bible, among other things.

49:11.386 --> 49:11.747
Oh.

49:11.907 --> 49:13.750
Are you concentrating on books?

49:14.354 --> 49:17.899
Well, it is strictly about books, yeah, books and manuscripts.

49:18.420 --> 49:19.701
All right.

49:19.722 --> 49:21.724
Well, when are you coming back to Washington?

49:21.744 --> 49:23.467
Well, it's going to be a while, I think.

49:23.547 --> 49:25.249
Well, my door's wide open for you.

49:25.329 --> 49:28.594
Tell me a little bit about yourself.

49:29.015 --> 49:36.185
Well, I'm thoroughly enjoying life and have for some, oh, 82 years, I guess.

49:36.385 --> 49:41.492
And my mission in life is to convert people to collecting something.

49:42.400 --> 49:43.261
Just something?

49:43.442 --> 49:44.683
To collect, something.

49:44.703 --> 49:47.407
What to collect is incidental.

49:47.427 --> 49:47.948
Ah, okay.

49:47.968 --> 49:49.851
In your case, we want to collect books.

49:49.871 --> 49:53.336
Yeah, but so do you deal with people who collect books?

49:53.556 --> 49:53.937
Exactly right.

49:53.957 --> 49:56.361
Collect people who collect anything.

49:56.381 --> 49:58.283
I got a whole lecture.

49:58.303 --> 50:04.793
I got a whole lecture just finished, that is a joy, The Wonderful World of Books.

50:04.993 --> 50:11.563
And it takes my audience around to the book stalls, the book stands, the book dealers of the world.

50:12.303 --> 50:14.627
Have you done this?

50:14.647 --> 50:16.249
Have you been to all these book places?

50:16.590 --> 50:19.054
Yeah, absolutely.

50:19.494 --> 50:21.998
Do you have this thing typed up or written?

50:22.158 --> 50:27.026
It's all in the head, but it's all documented with slides.

50:27.046 --> 50:27.787
Color pictures.

50:27.867 --> 50:29.871
I'll take you to Japan.

50:29.891 --> 50:32.915
It's a delightful book deal is there.

50:32.935 --> 50:35.880
To France, wherever you want to go, I'll take you.

50:36.468 --> 50:42.236
And it looks like we're colleagues in the same thing, except you're writing and I'm talking.

50:42.256 --> 50:47.323
But tell me a little bit, I mean, why is this a mission for you?

50:47.443 --> 50:53.352
Because you've got to do something in life, don't you?

50:53.372 --> 50:54.453
You've got to have some purpose for living.

50:54.673 --> 50:56.396
I mean, it gives an added zest.

50:56.416 --> 50:58.118
And how long have you been involved in this collecting?

50:58.138 --> 51:00.141
I'd say, modestly speaking, 65 years.

51:00.161 --> 51:00.862
Really?

51:00.882 --> 51:01.783
All in Washington?

51:01.964 --> 51:02.965
Oh, the whole world.

51:04.582 --> 51:11.434
Do you have any information that's been written or published, or do you have any brochures or anything you could send?

51:11.514 --> 51:23.915
I'll send you maybe a little broadside that I have, but I've got books just filled with data.

51:24.215 --> 51:27.361
I've spoken in every state of the Union.

51:27.381 --> 51:27.882
You have?

51:27.902 --> 51:28.142
Yeah.

51:28.595 --> 51:34.843
Except with one exception, Alaska, and maybe I can accomplish that shortly.

51:35.263 --> 51:37.346
How do you get these bookings?

51:37.366 --> 51:46.156
For 15 years, I was on the Geertig Lecture Bureau, Celebrity Series.

51:46.176 --> 51:47.939
So how do you go about getting people to collect?

51:47.959 --> 51:57.370
Everybody, everybody collects something until they prove themselves innocent, and I find out what they collect.

51:58.092 --> 52:02.180
And why have you been so committed to going about it in this way?

52:02.200 --> 52:03.903
Because I like happy people.

52:03.923 --> 52:17.650
And I have found collectors, as you have too, who have got some purpose in life, something to talk about, something to do, something to look for, are happy people.

52:17.670 --> 52:17.991
Now, uh...

52:18.157 --> 52:22.102
Can you have any great examples of people you've converted?

52:22.282 --> 52:23.904
Well, continuously meeting people.

52:23.944 --> 52:31.974
Today I met, I took some pictures of a young lady who kept Japanese woodblock prints, a soccer of a special school.

52:31.994 --> 52:38.121
And she was very grateful to me for contaminating her, for getting her started.

52:38.141 --> 52:41.565
I meet people who, I got going on collecting ivory coffee.

52:42.946 --> 52:49.714
called fantastic little miniatures, no larger than your thumb, called Netsuki.

52:49.734 --> 53:02.210
And they portray the whole folklore, legends, lifestyle of the Japanese, no larger than your thumb, but particularly executed.

53:02.390 --> 53:04.753
How about in terms of books now?

53:04.853 --> 53:07.957
I've got a whole lecture just on book collecting.

53:07.977 --> 53:08.838
What do you tell people on book collecting?

53:08.858 --> 53:09.038
Go ahead.

53:09.170 --> 53:13.076
Give me a little bit of information.

53:13.196 --> 53:13.557
All right.

53:13.577 --> 53:18.285
Tell me a little bit about it.

53:18.305 --> 53:19.827
Why don't I tape the thing and send it to you?

53:20.688 --> 53:20.929
Do you mind?

53:20.949 --> 53:22.732
Well, what can we do?

53:22.792 --> 53:27.179
If I'm giving you all my cards, what feedback do I get from you?

53:27.399 --> 53:28.401
I'm sorry, what do you mean?

53:28.421 --> 53:33.509
Well, I mean, if I can do a lot for you, what can you do for me?

53:33.529 --> 53:36.173
Well, I'm right now trying to find people and fucking things.

53:36.693 --> 53:38.936
get into this book that I'm writing.

53:38.956 --> 53:42.722
I'm writing a book right now.

53:42.742 --> 53:44.584
What's the title of your book?

53:44.604 --> 53:46.267
The book has a title.

53:46.327 --> 53:49.071
The title of the book is A Gentle Madness.

53:49.952 --> 53:50.913
Beautiful.

53:50.933 --> 53:52.596
It's about obsession.

53:52.616 --> 53:54.078
It's about obsession.

53:54.098 --> 53:54.679
Yes, it is.

53:54.699 --> 53:55.700
A Gentle Madness.

53:55.720 --> 53:58.144
That is a description of a bibliomaniac.

53:58.164 --> 54:03.291
This man's grandson said my grandfather was

54:06.359 --> 54:11.045
So I've appropriated that for my title.

54:11.065 --> 54:18.013
And I'm writing basically about people who have been obsessed with books.

54:18.093 --> 54:19.675
This is my subject.

54:19.695 --> 54:23.279
So what I'm looking for is information.

54:23.299 --> 54:27.824
I'm looking for people that have been bitten by the bug, so to speak.

54:27.925 --> 54:29.326
And about books, obviously, anyway.

54:29.346 --> 54:34.172
If it's artiques and stuff, that's not really what I'm... Well, when you come to Washington, I'll put the whole show on for you.

54:34.793 --> 54:41.481
Tommy, could you tell me a little bit right now while we speak?

54:41.601 --> 54:44.764
I want to reserve my judgment.

54:44.784 --> 54:45.405
That's the trifle.

54:45.425 --> 54:46.887
I want to be helpful to you.

54:46.907 --> 54:53.995
But I want to reserve my answer until I've got something definitely resolved on my wonderful world of books.

54:54.015 --> 54:54.115
Okay.

54:54.135 --> 54:55.476
And then we'll get together.

54:55.496 --> 54:56.297
I believe in sharing information.

54:56.317 --> 54:58.920
But my point is, you say, how can I work?

54:58.940 --> 55:01.123
What do you get from me in return?

55:01.143 --> 55:02.204
I guess I didn't finish saying that.

55:02.224 --> 55:03.045
I'm writing a book.

55:04.291 --> 55:10.899
not just for information, but for people, for individuals, who I might want to include in there.

55:10.919 --> 55:11.059
Okay.

55:11.139 --> 55:12.982
I've got some great ones.

55:13.102 --> 55:14.404
I've got some great ones.

55:14.464 --> 55:22.353
And I'm not saying anybody, everybody's got a chapter coming, you know what I'm saying, but I'm most certainly willing to listen.

55:22.854 --> 55:29.122
Marcia Carter was interested in what you had to say, and she passed on your card, and so here I am.

55:29.142 --> 55:32.786
Well, I'm glad you're there, and don't leave me until I get a piece of paper and put your name down.

55:32.806 --> 55:33.267
Hold it.

55:33.287 --> 55:33.387
Sure.

55:54.190 --> 56:01.245
Of course, of course you've got The Anatomy of the Bibliomania by Holbrook Jackson.

56:01.425 --> 56:01.606
Yeah.

56:01.726 --> 56:04.332
My God, what a repository that was.

56:04.352 --> 56:05.274
Yeah, that's quite interesting.

56:05.294 --> 56:07.498
And I imagine you're going to do the sequel to it.

56:07.639 --> 56:09.162
Well, that's kind of the idea.

56:09.182 --> 56:10.946
I'm writing about Bibliomania.

56:11.206 --> 56:12.108
Oh, okay.

56:12.329 --> 56:13.692
Gentle Bibliomania.

56:13.972 --> 56:14.393
All right.

56:15.942 --> 56:17.064
What's the title?

56:17.124 --> 56:18.266
Give it to me again.

56:18.286 --> 56:19.608
I kind of like to keep that.

56:19.848 --> 56:21.631
Then you keep it.

56:21.651 --> 56:22.612
Don't repeat it to me.

56:22.632 --> 56:23.253
Don't repeat it.

56:23.273 --> 56:25.517
Because, you know, nothing's yours until it's yours.

56:25.537 --> 56:27.580
You're exactly right.

56:27.600 --> 56:29.203
It's a book that was published.

56:29.323 --> 56:30.184
It's anybody.

56:30.365 --> 56:32.328
We understand each other thoroughly.

56:32.408 --> 56:35.112
Now, one more thing you're going to spell your name for.

56:35.192 --> 56:36.534
It's Nick as in Nicholas.

56:36.594 --> 56:41.862
Nicholas with an H. It's B as in boy.

56:41.883 --> 56:42.203
A-S-B.

56:42.993 --> 56:46.498
B-A-N-E-S, Bears Beans.

56:46.658 --> 56:50.283
B-A-S-D-A-N-E-S.

56:50.303 --> 56:56.111
And did you give this body address and everything like that?

56:56.131 --> 56:58.674
No, I'm going to give it to you now.

56:58.914 --> 57:00.817
Good.

57:00.857 --> 57:00.917
92.

57:00.937 --> 57:00.997
92.

57:01.017 --> 57:02.339
East Street.

57:03.561 --> 57:06.705
East Street.

57:06.725 --> 57:07.566
East Street, got it.

57:07.586 --> 57:09.709
North Rafton, G-R-A-F-T-O-N.

57:12.946 --> 57:19.894
R-A-S-T-O-N-G.

57:19.914 --> 57:21.416
Yeah.

57:21.616 --> 57:22.377
Mass.

57:22.537 --> 57:23.177
Mass.

57:23.318 --> 57:24.499
0-1-5-3-6.

57:24.519 --> 57:24.599
0-5.

57:24.619 --> 57:24.739
0-1-5.

57:24.759 --> 57:24.839
1-5.

57:24.859 --> 57:24.939
3-6.

57:24.959 --> 57:25.180
Great.

57:25.460 --> 57:29.445
Now, how close do you, to Boston?

57:29.465 --> 57:30.005
Close.

57:30.065 --> 57:30.566
Okay.

57:30.586 --> 57:34.350
Yeah, 45 minutes.

57:34.430 --> 57:36.032
That's no distance.

57:36.052 --> 57:36.192
Yeah.

57:36.212 --> 57:37.413
Sick list, I'm happy you've called me.

57:37.433 --> 57:38.014
We'll get together.

57:38.034 --> 57:42.379
Okay, well, just, you know, if you think of something you can send me that I can see, you know, even if it's

57:42.663 --> 57:44.585
paper or something.

57:44.605 --> 57:53.256
But I mean, I am interested in this passion that you have for converting people to collecting.

57:53.276 --> 57:55.960
You know, then my highlight has some use for that.

57:55.980 --> 57:56.420
All right.

57:56.440 --> 57:57.822
I want you to use it.

57:57.842 --> 57:59.504
But, you know, not yet per se.

57:59.524 --> 58:02.208
Maybe, you know, you... Anything you want to use, you know.

58:02.228 --> 58:05.212
I mean, you sound like an interesting character to me, to be honest with you.

58:05.232 --> 58:05.872
Oh, that's what I work at.

58:05.892 --> 58:07.695
I work at trying to be a character.

58:07.715 --> 58:09.958
And what I'm looking for are characters to use in my book.

58:10.158 --> 58:10.358
All right.

58:10.574 --> 58:15.981
That's what I'm traveling the whole country for.

58:16.702 --> 58:17.984
Exactly right.

58:18.024 --> 58:20.147
We understand each other.

58:20.167 --> 58:22.049
I went out to California in three weeks.

58:22.170 --> 58:23.952
I've been to England.

58:23.972 --> 58:24.813
I've been to France.

58:24.913 --> 58:25.634
I've been to Texas.

58:25.995 --> 58:26.916
I've been to Chicago.

58:26.936 --> 58:27.957
I've been to Washington.

58:27.977 --> 58:29.800
I've been to Philadelphia.

58:29.820 --> 58:30.981
I've been to New York so often.

58:31.001 --> 58:31.121
Super.

58:31.522 --> 58:33.485
You ought to have some great ones in New York.

58:33.505 --> 58:37.009
Well, I'm here all the time, and I'm really kind of covered in New York, and I've got some beautiful stories coming out of there.

58:37.029 --> 58:37.510
Good stories, you know.

58:37.861 --> 58:40.865
of the great collectors as well as the, uh, the smarts.

58:41.045 --> 58:42.347
Just a little fire blow.

58:42.367 --> 58:44.549
Give a little sky change.

58:44.569 --> 58:45.310
He needs his place.

58:45.330 --> 58:46.472
Only if he does something interesting.

58:46.712 --> 58:47.814
That's well put.

58:47.834 --> 58:49.516
That's right.

58:50.217 --> 58:51.398
I agree with you.

58:51.418 --> 58:52.379
I'm looking for good stories.

58:52.419 --> 58:56.064
That's what the whole thing hinges on.

58:56.144 --> 58:57.566
Okay, nice talking to you, sir.

58:57.586 --> 58:57.986
Thank you.

58:58.006 --> 58:58.687
I will talk again.

58:58.867 --> 59:01.130
Please.

59:03.213 --> 59:04.054
Hum, hum, hum, hum, hum.
