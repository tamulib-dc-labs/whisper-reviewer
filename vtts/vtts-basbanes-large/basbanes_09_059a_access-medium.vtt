WEBVTT

00:03.018 --> 00:04.160
Okay, we're ready now.

00:04.180 --> 00:05.822
Now we're ready.

00:05.842 --> 00:08.587
Okay, start again.

00:08.607 --> 00:10.069
That little red light is on, right?

00:10.349 --> 00:11.191
Little evil light, yeah.

00:11.211 --> 00:12.352
Go ahead.

00:12.372 --> 00:14.576
Last year, I wrote a piece for GQ.

00:15.457 --> 00:18.502
I went out and saw my mother's murder file for the first time in 36 years.

00:19.083 --> 00:20.184
Saw the pictures of her dead.

00:20.825 --> 00:22.408
Saw the picture renewed on the morgue slab.

00:23.770 --> 00:29.338
The man who showed me the file was working the unsolved unit of the LA County Sheriff's Homicide Bureau.

00:29.499 --> 00:31.742
It's the LA County Sheriff's, nothing to do with the LAPD.

00:32.718 --> 00:36.162
Wasn't a cop at the time my mother was dead, and he was about to retire now.

00:36.282 --> 00:38.244
Came on in 61, retired in 94.

00:38.744 --> 00:44.991
Bill Stoner, the man that saw the Cotton Club case.

00:45.011 --> 00:46.473
Did he have an interest in the case?

00:46.513 --> 00:47.153
No, no.

00:47.173 --> 00:47.834
I just called him up.

00:47.854 --> 00:49.336
I said, I want to see the query.

00:49.436 --> 00:50.357
Right, right.

00:50.897 --> 00:52.139
I said, I want to see the file.

00:52.419 --> 00:53.080
He showed it to me.

00:53.360 --> 00:54.181
We got to be friendly.

00:54.301 --> 00:57.605
I decided I wanted to expand the story about the file into a book.

00:59.667 --> 01:01.829
I told Sonny Mehta this, the boss, Alfred E. Knopf.

01:01.849 --> 01:02.590
He said, yeah, do it.

01:03.059 --> 01:06.922
told a lot of my publishers, foreign publishers, they said, yeah, go ahead, do it.

01:06.942 --> 01:07.603
They gave me offers.

01:07.803 --> 01:08.964
This is going to be a nonfiction book?

01:08.984 --> 01:09.104
Yes.

01:09.465 --> 01:09.785
The whole way?

01:09.805 --> 01:10.005
Yes.

01:10.105 --> 01:12.427
I mean, you don't have to play with the stuff.

01:12.447 --> 01:12.567
No.

01:12.587 --> 01:12.647
No.

01:12.667 --> 01:13.188
Can you do that?

01:13.588 --> 01:14.209
And then fiction.

01:14.249 --> 01:14.389
No.

01:14.729 --> 01:14.869
No.

01:14.949 --> 01:16.090
This is totally nonfiction.

01:16.271 --> 01:16.951
Okay.

01:16.971 --> 01:21.155
I mean, it's my autobiography, my mother's biography, Bill Stoner's biography.

01:22.276 --> 01:31.564
It is going to be a juxtaposition of the original 1958-59 investigation into my mother's death, recreated from witness testimony

01:33.097 --> 01:38.284
transcripts and official records, and then Bill Stoner and I have teamed up in the present day to reinvestigate the case.

01:38.964 --> 01:40.006
Take it as far as it can go.

01:40.086 --> 01:42.549
Now, Stoner's doing this as a private investigator?

01:42.749 --> 01:44.572
He's a reservist.

01:44.612 --> 01:45.653
He's a reservist to the L.A.

01:45.673 --> 01:46.654
Sheriff's.

01:46.674 --> 01:48.096
But he's not doing this officially, then.

01:48.116 --> 01:48.637
He's doing this.

01:48.957 --> 01:50.739
You're hiring him to do it, basically.

01:50.759 --> 01:51.661
No, we're doing it together.

01:51.741 --> 01:53.182
He's getting a percentage of the book profits.

01:53.283 --> 01:53.443
Oh.

01:54.704 --> 01:56.246
Is he going to have a byline on the book?

01:56.427 --> 01:58.810
No.

01:58.830 --> 01:59.931
We've already sold the movie, right?

02:00.957 --> 02:05.604
to a producer named Robert Greenwald, a man that did A Woman of Independent Means for TV.

02:06.105 --> 02:06.886
That's what I'm doing now.

02:07.327 --> 02:09.009
So that's the basic story.

02:09.370 --> 02:10.772
How far into the book are you?

02:11.112 --> 02:11.954
I haven't even started yet.

02:11.994 --> 02:16.080
We'll probably be on the investigation all the way through the summer.

02:16.100 --> 02:18.023
Are you hopeful that you can solve this?

02:18.143 --> 02:19.385
Well, there's a linchpin to the case.

02:20.026 --> 02:23.872
My mother was last seen with a dark-haired swarthy man and a blonde woman.

02:25.154 --> 02:26.996
What one of these?

02:27.377 --> 02:27.437
No.

02:28.970 --> 02:29.851
Left a bar together.

02:29.891 --> 02:31.473
My mother's body was found the next morning.

02:32.213 --> 02:34.956
A blonde woman never came forth, presumably for fear of reprisals.

02:36.538 --> 02:38.240
And 36 years have passed.

02:39.481 --> 02:47.769
In these alcohol-fueled rape murders, very often the material witnesses, those who don't come forth, end up talking about it, and to lots of people.

02:48.570 --> 02:55.658
Senator believes there's a number of people out there who know elements of the story or the entire story, and maybe even the identity of the man.

02:55.938 --> 02:57.019
The man himself might have talked about.

02:58.619 --> 03:09.415
It's just a question of getting enough publicity, going through our established investigatory procedures and getting as much publicity as we can and sifting through the information and misinformation.

03:10.316 --> 03:12.099
Is this important to you as a person or as a writer?

03:12.339 --> 03:15.163
Both.

03:15.283 --> 03:16.845
I would not undertake this investigation.

03:16.865 --> 03:21.452
You're pretty honest that your mother was not your most favorite person in the whole world.

03:21.472 --> 03:22.714
I have no idea who she is.

03:23.796 --> 03:24.176
No idea.

03:24.296 --> 03:25.538
Not an idea in hell who she is.

03:26.159 --> 03:27.722
I hated her in the months preceding her death.

03:27.923 --> 03:28.865
She had been lousy to me.

03:29.165 --> 03:30.087
She'd been good to me before.

03:30.148 --> 03:36.742
She was a complex, tormented, alcoholic, promiscuous woman, and I want to know who she was.

03:38.245 --> 03:41.191
I would not undertake this investigation if there weren't a book attached to it.

03:41.211 --> 03:42.113
I simply couldn't afford to.

03:42.835 --> 03:44.438
I couldn't afford to put down work

03:44.924 --> 03:47.788
for six months and go around chasing leads.

03:47.928 --> 03:49.130
Is it a continuation?

03:49.170 --> 03:50.471
Is it part of the oeuvre?

03:51.012 --> 03:52.674
Because it is a non-fiction book for you.

03:52.714 --> 03:54.136
It's a non-fiction book.

03:55.057 --> 03:56.980
It's a part of the oeuvre.

03:58.101 --> 03:59.964
It's totally separate from the oeuvre.

03:59.984 --> 04:01.326
It is non-fiction.

04:01.686 --> 04:02.307
Everything is true.

04:02.327 --> 04:03.709
Does it fit in with what you've done?

04:05.351 --> 04:06.452
Yes and no.

04:06.472 --> 04:07.254
It's what it is.

04:08.495 --> 04:09.256
It's a non-fiction.

04:09.837 --> 04:10.318
It happened.

04:11.379 --> 04:12.320
It's my autobiography.

04:12.761 --> 04:13.682
But certainly you're going to write it

04:14.152 --> 04:21.963
with all the skill and the literary techniques and perception that you can muster as an artist.

04:22.043 --> 04:23.945
Mostly it's the journey back into myself.

04:25.427 --> 04:29.293
And you have no idea how far forward you're going to take it, or are you going to just revolve it around?

04:29.873 --> 04:30.995
I have no idea the structure.

04:31.095 --> 04:33.779
I'm not even fucking with anything yet.

04:33.799 --> 04:35.201
I have no idea what the structure will be.

04:36.683 --> 04:41.990
I'm just going to reinvestigate the case with Bill Stoner through the summer and sit down and write the book.

04:42.010 --> 04:42.150
Mm-hmm.

04:43.278 --> 04:44.839
Have you put a deadline on it?

04:44.859 --> 04:45.920
No.

04:45.940 --> 04:48.283
So you said through the summer, but I mean, what if you're close?

04:49.063 --> 04:51.325
You don't see yourself being obsessed with this.

04:51.345 --> 04:53.707
Oh, I am obsessed with it.

04:53.727 --> 04:54.708
Yeah.

04:54.728 --> 04:57.671
Ikenoff tentatively wants the book for the fall of 1996.

04:57.691 --> 05:00.834
Well, that doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot of that.

05:00.934 --> 05:03.496
Ikenoff is very good at turning books around very fast.

05:07.620 --> 05:08.901
What's the root of the obsession?

05:08.921 --> 05:10.943
Just an unsolved crime that happens to involve you?

05:10.963 --> 05:12.184
It's my mother.

05:12.564 --> 05:13.285
Yeah, it's my mother.

05:13.788 --> 05:14.369
I went back.

05:14.689 --> 05:15.350
I saw the file.

05:16.011 --> 05:17.452
I said to myself, it's not over.

05:19.335 --> 05:21.417
I saw the opportunity to write a great book.

05:22.258 --> 05:27.785
And of course, and this is kind of a cliche question, but are you a writer because of these events?

05:27.865 --> 05:28.086
Sure.

05:29.067 --> 05:29.287
Sure.

05:29.768 --> 05:33.893
But more than anything else, I'm a writer because I've always loved to read.

05:33.913 --> 05:38.739
I write the kind of books that I loved to read as a kid.

05:38.779 --> 05:42.343
And of course, my taste has evolved.

05:43.218 --> 05:48.006
Now, I get no satisfaction from reading other people's books, only very occasionally.

05:48.727 --> 05:48.968
Really?

05:49.088 --> 05:54.136
And I have to write the books to save my desire for reading this.

05:54.156 --> 05:56.240
Why is it that other people don't?

05:57.001 --> 05:59.545
I don't think any crime writer is very good.

05:59.866 --> 06:01.228
I just don't see anybody who's being very good.

06:01.248 --> 06:02.029
You mean out there now?

06:02.189 --> 06:04.573
Out there now, yeah.

06:04.593 --> 06:05.715
I've reviewed Raymond Chandler.

06:05.735 --> 06:06.697
I don't think he's very good.

06:07.638 --> 06:08.640
Tremendously overrated.

06:09.562 --> 06:09.782
And...

06:12.901 --> 06:14.403
I have to do this.

06:15.564 --> 06:17.006
And it's consciousness after a while.

06:17.227 --> 06:25.137
All good writers and great writers bring a certain amount of, you might call it thematic unity in their unconscious, to the craft.

06:25.157 --> 06:31.966
They can write two or three or four books based on everything that they've known and felt, their knowledge of form that they've gotten from reading books.

06:33.387 --> 06:36.391
And after that, it becomes a question of, you can take the rest.

06:36.592 --> 06:39.135
You can write bigger books, darker books, deeper books, denser books.

06:39.515 --> 06:41.558
You're going to write in the third person and the first person.

06:41.808 --> 06:42.789
You're going to change your style.

06:43.370 --> 06:45.131
Are you exploring the form?

06:45.151 --> 06:46.252
Is it a constant exploration?

06:46.272 --> 06:46.953
Oh, absolutely.

06:47.253 --> 06:47.774
Absolutely.

06:47.794 --> 06:49.295
Did you read what you asked?

06:49.315 --> 06:51.137
I have it with me.

06:51.157 --> 06:51.257
Yeah.

06:51.277 --> 06:53.660
That book, it's totally experimental.

06:53.680 --> 06:56.622
And you got your balls squeezed for that.

06:56.803 --> 06:57.063
No.

06:57.904 --> 06:58.584
People loved the book.

06:58.604 --> 06:59.425
People hated the book.

06:59.605 --> 07:01.888
Did not sell his book as well as my previous book.

07:06.732 --> 07:11.477
The first book of yours I read was The Big Nowhere.

07:11.879 --> 07:13.240
Yeah.

07:13.260 --> 07:14.181
Totally blew me away.

07:14.882 --> 07:20.508
Came in, book review editor, and I had the black guy, you know, preceded it.

07:20.789 --> 07:21.810
Yeah.

07:21.830 --> 07:24.112
I mean, it was one of these feasts, you know.

07:24.132 --> 07:24.553
Yeah.

07:26.395 --> 07:28.337
I thought LA Confidential did different things.

07:28.917 --> 07:29.238
Yeah.

07:30.819 --> 07:37.887
For me, weren't as satisfying as the... The themes, the two themes of the black guy, yeah.

07:38.508 --> 07:49.559
and The Big Nowhere, you know, the sexual obsession that's in, you know, that's in The Black Dahlia and The Twin Thieves of Homosexuality and Communism in The Big Nowhere are very powerful.

07:49.579 --> 07:50.720
And L.A.

07:50.740 --> 07:52.181
Confidential is a more sprawling book.

07:52.822 --> 07:57.246
It's really a story about a city and its political underpinnings and the crimes that built it.

07:57.666 --> 08:02.311
No, I'm amazed that you did, and I love the jacket art on those books.

08:02.611 --> 08:03.052
It's terrific.

08:03.072 --> 08:04.613
They really did evoke the 50s, I think.

08:04.733 --> 08:05.334
Yeah, yeah.

08:05.514 --> 08:05.934
Beautifully.

08:06.575 --> 08:06.675
Yeah.

08:08.275 --> 08:12.780
I mean, you don't remember anything in the 50s to speak of.

08:13.281 --> 08:15.243
Sure, sure I do.

08:15.484 --> 08:16.605
I was born in 48.

08:16.625 --> 08:20.249
I remember things from, I remember the Army-McCarthy hearings in 1954.

08:20.269 --> 08:20.750
No kidding.

08:20.770 --> 08:24.655
I remember Eisenhower's re-election in 50s.

08:24.675 --> 08:26.256
I mean, I remember a lot.

08:26.557 --> 08:33.405
Are you basically trying to write about, you know, using, you know, 48 as the year of your birth and trying to write

08:33.605 --> 08:45.155
It all really starts with the Black Dahlia and my obsession with that case and how it grew out of my mother's murder, and in my mind, imaginatively, the symbiosis of the two dead women.

08:46.056 --> 08:49.239
From that point on, I realized that I wanted to recreate L.A.

08:49.259 --> 08:51.401
in the 50s because I lived through it.

08:51.741 --> 09:02.110
I evinced absolutely no precocity as a kid, but I sensed, especially after my mother's death, crazy shit going on outside the frame of my consciousness.

09:03.794 --> 09:11.943
I wrote that quartet, and I said, you know, let's not write strict crime novels anymore.

09:12.784 --> 09:14.366
I said to myself, I want to get out of L.A.

09:14.747 --> 09:20.013
I don't want to be known as a guy who wrote four great books about demonic cops from 1947 to 1959.

09:21.575 --> 09:29.003
I wanted to write about crime as politics and the private nightmare of public policy.

09:29.424 --> 09:32.367
That's when I conceived American Tabloid, which is the first book in the trilogy.

09:32.414 --> 09:34.937
It's absolutely not a crime novel.

09:34.957 --> 09:36.158
Certainly not a mystery novel.

09:37.099 --> 09:38.981
There are no homicide investigations in this book.

09:39.141 --> 09:40.262
What is it then?

09:41.764 --> 09:43.285
Would you classify it in any way?

09:43.426 --> 09:49.051
I'd call it punchy mainstream popular fiction.

09:49.071 --> 09:53.276
Certainly the noir aspect is... The noir aspect is still in it.

09:53.296 --> 09:54.417
Without question, it's still in it.

09:54.757 --> 09:55.798
Yeah.

09:55.818 --> 09:56.840
I think it's history's noir.

09:59.242 --> 10:00.143
I think it's...

10:01.675 --> 10:10.026
a great hyperbolic novel of that last gasp of pre-public accountability in America.

10:14.311 --> 10:18.357
You have a preparatory note.

10:18.377 --> 10:20.479
I mean, there is no innocence, apparently, you say.

10:20.640 --> 10:22.101
I said America was never innocent.

10:22.121 --> 10:23.543
Never innocent.

10:23.703 --> 10:28.930
So there are some critics who suggest that this is a loss of innocence book.

10:29.191 --> 10:30.332
It's not a loss of innocence.

10:30.869 --> 10:34.273
There never was any.

10:34.293 --> 10:37.096
So it's a very cynical book in that respect.

10:37.116 --> 10:37.637
No, I don't think so.

10:37.657 --> 10:38.718
I think it's a realistic book.

10:38.738 --> 10:41.501
And I think that the morality of the book is the humanity of the characters.

10:42.262 --> 10:43.964
And I like messing with people's heads.

10:44.084 --> 10:47.168
I want them to identify with people under Ward, Littell, and Kemper Boyd.

10:48.529 --> 10:49.791
I want them to be applauded by them.

10:50.432 --> 10:52.174
I want them to feel for them.

10:52.194 --> 10:59.442
I want them to feel chiefly seduced by the Kennedys in the manner the characters were.

11:00.805 --> 11:08.392
I want people to step outside of themselves and go, wow, I'm really rooting for these guys to whack out Jack the Haircut.

11:09.774 --> 11:09.894
Yeah.

11:10.334 --> 11:11.335
Man, what a blast.

11:11.355 --> 11:12.296
Invade the Bear Pigs.

11:12.436 --> 11:13.337
Man, what a blast.

11:13.437 --> 11:16.600
Put that twist girl, Bob Jahelka, and Jack the Haircut's dead.

11:18.162 --> 11:23.407
But you really are kind of giving it a half a turn, aren't you?

11:23.447 --> 11:27.350
You really want us to be cheering for them for the wrong people, perhaps, no?

11:28.491 --> 11:29.192
I like these guys.

11:29.510 --> 11:31.192
I certainly don't want to hang out with them.

11:31.232 --> 11:32.614
You don't admire them, so to speak.

11:32.874 --> 11:33.735
No, I don't admire them.

11:33.835 --> 11:35.077
You're not making moral judgments, certainly.

11:35.257 --> 11:36.679
No, no.

11:36.759 --> 11:41.485
The only moral judgment there is that every man pays terrible crimes.

11:42.346 --> 11:44.509
I mean, the guy killed his own brother, for God's sakes.

11:44.749 --> 11:45.550
Pete Bonner, yeah.

11:45.610 --> 11:46.591
Well, you know what?

11:46.611 --> 11:48.574
I think Bobby killed Jack.

11:48.594 --> 11:49.175
Come on.

11:50.897 --> 11:53.100
You don't kill John F. Kennedy's father did.

11:53.540 --> 11:55.543
It was Bobby's Oedipal Drama the guy Jack killed.

11:55.983 --> 11:59.027
Bobby was the only guy, the only fucking Kennedy...

12:00.020 --> 12:06.089
with the moral vision to recognize Joe Kennedy for what he really was.

12:06.129 --> 12:13.040
He persecuted Joe Kennedy once removed by going after the mob, and more than anything else, that's what got Jack killed.

12:15.223 --> 12:15.503
Yeah, okay.

12:15.523 --> 12:16.805
Yeah, I firmly believe that.

12:16.825 --> 12:19.990
And so you have a story there very much of brothers and fathers and sons.

12:20.691 --> 12:22.634
Bondurant killed his own brother by accident.

12:22.694 --> 12:27.141
Kemper Boyd's brother died in a hunting accident, and Bobby kills Jack.

12:28.403 --> 12:32.307
Do you feel any kind of obligation to the factual record?

12:33.148 --> 12:36.071
You're doing tremendous research now for your non-fiction book.

12:36.091 --> 12:37.073
Right.

12:37.333 --> 12:38.494
I did research on this book, too.

12:38.534 --> 12:40.156
To what extent?

12:40.216 --> 12:43.840
Well, the only question I never answer on an exam was what's true and what's not.

12:44.621 --> 12:45.742
I want to keep that ambiguous.

12:45.842 --> 12:49.927
Is this true with a capital C, or just in terms of factual things?

12:49.947 --> 12:50.888
I did a bunch of research.

12:50.948 --> 12:51.809
I hired a researcher.

12:51.849 --> 12:57.415
She compiled notes for me, chiefly chronologies, because I knew what I wanted to work with.

12:58.019 --> 12:59.881
You've got to keep that line blurred.

13:01.643 --> 13:13.415
And I have an obligation to stay faithful to my view of history, which I think I do in that book.

13:13.896 --> 13:15.538
Do you have a view of history?

13:16.058 --> 13:27.030
My view of history is basically power-driven, grasping men getting caught up in events that they think they control and can't.

13:28.748 --> 13:31.971
And this is a general observation, this is a general view.

13:31.991 --> 13:32.892
Yeah, it's a general view.

13:33.032 --> 13:34.974
Applied successively in areas.

13:34.994 --> 13:39.698
Applied, it's applied here because I don't generally think in the abstract.

13:41.920 --> 13:46.785
Ideas come to me, stories come to me, characters come to me, and I start putting it together.

13:47.485 --> 13:54.572
And it isn't until I finish the book that I realize that's what this book is about.

13:54.612 --> 13:55.633
These are the themes.

13:58.820 --> 14:02.645
Now, can you give me some idea of the other books in the trilogy?

14:03.646 --> 14:07.490
Book number two, it's called the Underworld USA Trilogy.

14:07.510 --> 14:09.713
So you have a name for the trilogy?

14:09.833 --> 14:11.595
Yeah, Underworld USA Trilogy.

14:12.096 --> 14:14.138
Well, item two... Colon Trilogy?

14:14.398 --> 14:15.480
The Kong Trilogy?

14:15.500 --> 14:16.721
No, Colon Trilogy.

14:17.322 --> 14:18.183
Underworld USA Trilogy.

14:18.403 --> 14:19.985
No, Underworld USA Trilogy.

14:20.906 --> 14:25.992
Volume two picks up five minutes after American Tabloid concludes in Dallas.

14:26.883 --> 14:29.206
and covers 63 to 68 in America.

14:30.447 --> 14:31.809
A lot of the same characters occur.

14:33.792 --> 14:41.561
Bobby Kennedy, Pete Ponderant, Ward Littell, Jimmy Hoffa, Howard Hughes, J. Edgar DuBois.

14:41.581 --> 14:47.068
And we go to Vietnam, we go to Las Vegas, we go to Dallas, we go to LA, we go to Chicago.

14:47.588 --> 14:54.897
Volume 3, I have no idea about, but I know that it will be a seamless continuum following up on Volume 2.

14:55.098 --> 14:57.801
You know the year that it can close?

14:59.624 --> 15:01.826
Do you have an event?

15:01.887 --> 15:03.248
That's quite a defining year.

15:03.348 --> 15:12.280
We've got J. Edgar Hoover and his war on the Civil Rights Movement, Martin Luther King's assassination, Bobby Kennedy's assassination.

15:15.145 --> 15:18.330
I mean, if you're looking for bookends, you certainly have them there.

15:20.053 --> 15:20.894
Yeah, yeah.

15:23.498 --> 15:25.361
How accurate do you think the characters are?

15:25.841 --> 15:29.207
The characters based on actual people?

15:30.609 --> 15:36.898
You know, years ago, Herman Chandler said that Dashiell Hammett took murder and gave it back to the people who really committed it.

15:37.800 --> 15:41.305
I would like to go back even more at a vista plate

15:42.736 --> 15:45.920
and give it back to the people that I see as having really committed it.

15:46.621 --> 15:56.293
The primary sensibility in crime fiction is that there is a man or a woman, and down these mean streets they go.

15:56.333 --> 15:58.055
They're neither tarnished nor afraid.

15:58.796 --> 16:00.418
They hate racism.

16:00.438 --> 16:02.220
They hate authority.

16:02.561 --> 16:04.523
They're rebels within the system.

16:04.543 --> 16:08.608
The system tries to grind them to dust, but they can't because they have real integrity.

16:09.549 --> 16:12.473
They are conveniently...

16:12.858 --> 16:28.179
liberal in the best sense of the world, where they are incorruptible, they are egalitarian in their worldview, they are lonely, haunted, but unafraid, and easy for readers to identify with.

16:28.319 --> 16:30.662
That's the formula that Raymond Chandler started.

16:30.743 --> 16:40.536
It's profoundly adaptable, which is why now you've got the black private eye, the gay black private eye, you know, the gay black woman private eye, the dwarf private eye, the

16:40.988 --> 16:42.730
extraterrestrial, private eye.

16:43.071 --> 16:45.514
It's also, you know, cheap shot, very easy writing, too.

16:46.014 --> 16:52.102
I could write first person, conversational, private eye book, and a good one by the standards of the genre, which to me is totally moribund.

16:52.442 --> 16:53.583
I could write one in two weeks.

16:54.304 --> 16:58.229
And for all I know, make more money and sell more books than I'm going to be selling now.

16:58.610 --> 17:07.941
But my vision of crime is that the real protagonists are these historical bottom feeders

17:08.579 --> 17:12.062
who are not the foes of the corrupt system but the exploiters of it.

17:13.444 --> 17:15.906
The guys that break legs for Jack the haircut.

17:17.287 --> 17:35.244
The guys that beat up Rodney King interest me more than the guys in the LAPD who might be appalled by that and who might set out to be knights on their own.

17:35.264 --> 17:37.506
And I want to give crime fiction back

17:38.127 --> 17:38.968
to these guys.

17:43.234 --> 17:46.839
Are you pleased to be here while the OJ thing is going on out there?

17:47.159 --> 17:48.661
Oh, shit, I haven't followed it.

17:49.662 --> 17:50.303
I haven't followed it at all.

17:50.323 --> 17:52.626
You haven't been tempted at all to pick up on any of it?

17:52.646 --> 17:56.872
I wrote a piece about an essay on it for GQ, which was in the December issue.

17:58.073 --> 18:00.336
But that was just my impressions of the overall media service.

18:00.376 --> 18:01.498
I don't know any of the specifics.

18:02.559 --> 18:04.021
I stay away from popular culture.

18:04.081 --> 18:04.682
I go to movies.

18:05.423 --> 18:06.885
But this is implied in your view.

18:07.591 --> 18:07.871
What?

18:08.132 --> 18:10.054
This isn't a crime story in your view?

18:10.154 --> 18:11.736
I don't know what it is.

18:11.756 --> 18:14.459
I don't know what it is beyond my initial reaction to it.

18:14.579 --> 18:20.767
They say Joe McGinnis is out there attempting to do something out of the book.

18:20.787 --> 18:27.214
I'm curious to see what he comes up with.

18:27.234 --> 18:35.404
Assuming that everything I've read about your early years after your mother's murder accurately and accurately reported doesn't seem

18:35.823 --> 18:39.487
to have you recount any of it as accurate as I've read it.

18:39.607 --> 18:49.777
But I really am interested in the forces that drove you to become an occasional delight.

18:50.017 --> 18:51.579
I know you said these are things that you've read.

18:52.019 --> 18:52.700
I love to read.

18:53.541 --> 18:54.982
I wanted to tell stories.

18:55.243 --> 18:57.605
I wanted the identity of being a novelist.

18:58.646 --> 19:00.128
Crime fiction is the big love of my life.

19:00.248 --> 19:01.609
Would that happen without your money?

19:01.669 --> 19:02.490
I don't know.

19:02.510 --> 19:03.031
I can't say.

19:03.531 --> 19:04.412
The die was cast.

19:07.025 --> 19:08.226
The die was cast.

19:13.633 --> 19:18.239
Certainly the Black Dahlia story has its parallels, doesn't it?

19:18.259 --> 19:18.979
Yeah, it does.

19:20.702 --> 19:23.044
How did that story come to your attention?

19:23.064 --> 19:27.410
My father got me a book called The Badge by Jack Webb of Dragnet fame for my 11th birthday.

19:30.914 --> 19:33.437
And then this has kind of resonated through the years?

19:34.126 --> 19:34.647
I read it.

19:34.667 --> 19:38.272
My mother had been murdered six months prior, seven months prior.

19:38.292 --> 19:40.195
It shocked me.

19:40.215 --> 19:40.997
Well, yeah.

19:41.738 --> 19:42.779
Really, man.

19:42.799 --> 19:43.921
He did me a big service.

19:45.884 --> 19:51.392
I became very much interested in crime that first summer following my mother's death.

19:51.412 --> 20:01.568
And he got me the badge, and I read it, and I got obsessed with the Black Dahlia case, and had terrible nightmares about Elizabeth Short, and years passed, and

20:03.100 --> 20:04.562
I thought about it and thought about it.

20:04.582 --> 20:09.830
My curiosity spiraled out to encompass L.A.'

20:09.810 --> 20:11.532
's criminal history, crime in general.

20:11.632 --> 20:15.698
Read a million crime books, good, bad, and indifferent.

20:15.718 --> 20:19.925
But I always wanted to write because what does anybody want?

20:19.965 --> 20:23.009
You know, they want to express their inner life.

20:23.951 --> 20:28.537
They want to rewrite their personal history.

20:28.958 --> 20:32.483
They want to fix events for posterity.

20:33.695 --> 20:38.503
And I thought that I had the kind of brain that could not come up with the complex, well-layered plots that crime fiction requires.

20:39.465 --> 20:43.412
I thought I'd write painful novels about being a young drug addict, drunk in America.

20:44.093 --> 20:47.339
What gave me that crazy notion, I don't know, because I can't stand reading stuff like that.

20:48.020 --> 20:50.505
Why the fuck should I, you know, I just don't want to read it.

20:51.066 --> 20:54.011
The first story that came to me was Brown's Requiem, my first novel.

20:55.994 --> 20:57.036
Did it basically...

20:57.995 --> 21:01.540
I wrote an outline.

21:01.661 --> 21:05.426
I wrote an abbreviated outline for it, followed the outline, wrote the book, and sold it.

21:05.747 --> 21:07.710
You really are an outline person, aren't you?

21:07.730 --> 21:10.074
The outline for American Tabloid is 250 pages.

21:10.134 --> 21:10.514
Amazing.

21:11.055 --> 21:14.340
So there really are no surprises for you as the work?

21:14.541 --> 21:22.513
Well, the characters embellish the details of their lives, flesh out, in the course of writing the actual text.

21:23.414 --> 21:24.576
But I don't deviate from the plot.

21:25.855 --> 21:28.618
The plot itself is pretty well fixed in the outlet.

21:31.662 --> 21:39.230
The quote I've read in several places, that you want to be perceived as the American Tolstoy.

21:40.812 --> 21:42.614
Want to give me a comment on that?

21:42.734 --> 21:48.381
I've never read Tolstoy, but I've never read any American crime novels, just about.

21:50.082 --> 21:51.424
I want to write The Biggest Baddest.

21:51.978 --> 21:53.800
So why did you say the American Tolstoy?

21:53.860 --> 21:54.881
Because he writes the biggest.

21:55.321 --> 22:01.067
He's often mentioned as the king novelist, the guy that gives you the most bang for your buck.

22:01.988 --> 22:03.109
And that's how I feel about it.

22:05.311 --> 22:15.481
Does it disturb you that, you said earlier, that this book, and I quite agree, that this isn't a crime novel, that you have been identified as a genre writer that bothers you, doesn't bother you, or you don't care?

22:15.501 --> 22:19.204
I've been reviewed twice now in the New York Times, and I mean big full-page threads.

22:19.805 --> 22:21.006
Not mystery, either one.

22:21.577 --> 22:23.459
Yeah, I think I've moved away from that.

22:26.463 --> 22:28.225
And how do you see the body of work?

22:28.725 --> 22:30.708
I mean, do you see it as... I see it as expanding.

22:31.188 --> 22:33.571
I see each book as being better than the book that preceded it.

22:34.592 --> 22:36.955
I see myself as taking risks.

22:36.975 --> 22:43.222
I see an accumulation of critical acclaim.

22:45.525 --> 22:48.047
And... Is that important to you?

22:48.448 --> 22:49.709
Yeah, you know, it is.

22:50.050 --> 22:51.111
It is.

22:51.395 --> 22:52.096
I enjoy it.

22:52.176 --> 22:54.780
It's validation at its lowest level.

22:54.860 --> 22:57.464
That's what it's definable as.

22:57.484 --> 22:58.966
What's validation at the highest level?

23:01.289 --> 23:01.990
The book itself.

23:02.451 --> 23:04.334
You just hand the book and say, I wrote that.

23:04.354 --> 23:04.975
It's a Knopf book.

23:05.796 --> 23:08.099
That stands for a lot, doesn't it?

23:08.119 --> 23:09.041
Yeah, it's a Knopf book.

23:09.061 --> 23:11.184
I mean, look how beautiful the physical book is itself.

23:11.284 --> 23:13.367
Oh, it's gorgeous.

23:13.387 --> 23:16.111
And that's the validation at the highest level.

23:16.692 --> 23:17.793
Do you have a reader in mind?

23:17.833 --> 23:18.955
No, myself.

23:20.622 --> 23:22.785
I'm the most exacting judge out there.

23:23.406 --> 23:29.496
I mean, I'm pleased that you aren't cowed in any way by political correctness.

23:31.579 --> 23:33.782
Political correctness, I guess it had its head in.

23:33.802 --> 23:34.383
It's gone now.

23:34.403 --> 23:35.285
Everybody loathes it.

23:36.166 --> 23:39.131
Everybody loathes it, but boy, it's still there.

23:40.212 --> 23:44.399
I mean, we just got through February, Black History Month.

23:45.200 --> 23:49.026
The best success I had was with a story of this woman from Martha's Vineyard.

23:49.377 --> 23:56.384
You know, Dorothy West, survivor of the Harlem Renaissance.

23:56.424 --> 23:57.605
She's very old now.

23:57.625 --> 23:58.786
She's 87.

23:58.986 --> 23:59.567
Lovely lady.

24:00.047 --> 24:02.189
Went and did a feature opera.

24:02.209 --> 24:03.130
Placed it everywhere.

24:03.150 --> 24:04.352
I mean, everybody took it.

24:04.372 --> 24:06.414
Milwaukee Journal took it.

24:07.515 --> 24:12.439
So you can talk about everybody loading it, but I mean, this piece basically satisfied everything.

24:14.221 --> 24:17.564
African-American, you know what I'm saying.

24:17.584 --> 24:19.266
Blah, blah, blah, blah, I pressed the board.

24:19.465 --> 24:25.154
So you're not supposed to say black anymore, right?

24:25.875 --> 24:26.596
She says black.

24:26.616 --> 24:27.477
She says colored.

24:27.537 --> 24:29.360
I mean, she comes before black.

24:29.400 --> 24:30.562
She's from Negro.

24:30.582 --> 24:31.723
She's coming from Negro.

24:31.743 --> 24:32.905
Yeah.

24:32.925 --> 24:37.853
Of course, the whole thing about this book is that it is people who pass, you know.

24:38.053 --> 24:41.959
Her father was blue eyes and passed for white.

24:42.560 --> 24:42.760
Yeah.

24:43.621 --> 24:46.125
I used to know a wino caddy named Charlie Tucker.

24:46.846 --> 24:47.207
Black guy.

24:47.227 --> 24:48.088
Good looking guy, too.

24:48.338 --> 24:58.915
I used to say, my name is Charlie Tucker, I'm a bad motherfucker, and I don't take shit from a no-cocksucker.

25:00.277 --> 25:04.323
I guess we all, you know, you write what you know, too.

25:04.343 --> 25:14.599
I mean, I guess the reality of the persuasiveness of the people above whom you write, I guess this does come from your own

25:15.625 --> 25:17.267
Dark years, I guess, out there.

25:17.327 --> 25:18.609
Yeah, curiosity.

25:18.849 --> 25:21.232
And a lot of it is, again, it's just consciousness.

25:21.292 --> 25:23.615
I have just tried to change.

25:23.695 --> 25:24.316
Tried.

25:25.277 --> 25:29.643
And as I've gotten older, I felt the ebb and flow of the years and the history.

25:30.584 --> 25:32.827
The ebb and flow of history.

25:33.808 --> 25:42.780
And now I'm writing about the early 1960s, which is the era of my consciousness, as opposed to the era of my childhood.

25:43.334 --> 25:45.856
And I realized I was taking notes back then.

25:46.517 --> 25:46.877
You were?

25:46.958 --> 25:47.678
Mental notes, yeah.

25:50.021 --> 25:50.121
Yeah.

25:50.141 --> 25:52.042
Do you think you had works in mind?

25:53.003 --> 25:54.165
Mental notes.

25:54.185 --> 25:59.129
This is material that you kind of knew intuitively that you had summoned forth at some point?

25:59.189 --> 26:03.414
I knew that sooner or later I wanted to write books, but it was just a pipe dream then.

26:03.474 --> 26:09.880
And on the first book, that was a paperback, I guess, right?

26:09.900 --> 26:10.000
Yeah.

26:10.638 --> 26:13.061
And were these with Otto, or Otto came later?

26:13.081 --> 26:15.305
No, Otto came later.

26:15.325 --> 26:17.608
My first two books were Avon paperback originals.

26:18.710 --> 26:20.252
You've got to collect his items.

26:20.272 --> 26:21.834
Yeah, the first editions are, yeah.

26:22.475 --> 26:26.200
Then the three Lloyd Hopkins books, Blood on the Moon, Because of the Night and Suicide Hill, that I did for Otto.

26:26.701 --> 26:35.173
Then I did another paperback original for Avon called Cure on the Road, which was also published as Silent Terror, which is not my title.

26:36.335 --> 26:38.217
Then I did the L.A.

26:38.237 --> 26:40.020
Quartet, the first three volumes for him.

26:40.760 --> 26:42.923
Was this mindfully a quartet when it started?

26:43.043 --> 26:47.530
No, I decided after I wrote The Black Diet that I wanted to turn it into a quartet.

26:48.852 --> 26:51.476
So this trilogy will take us through the 60s, I gather?

26:51.556 --> 26:52.457
Into 1973.

26:52.738 --> 27:01.891
Basically three books, a trilogy, 15 years of history broken down into five-year influence.

27:01.911 --> 27:02.873
And what comes after that?

27:04.475 --> 27:06.038
You want to keep bringing it forward?

27:06.058 --> 27:09.703
You know, the non-fiction book is next, and then the trilogy.

27:10.274 --> 27:13.597
I want to do the biggest crime novel ever written.

27:14.538 --> 27:17.601
It's going to be about two generations of the Wisconsin State Police.

27:23.067 --> 27:24.368
My mother's from Wisconsin.

27:24.468 --> 27:26.670
I've spent scant time there.

27:26.710 --> 27:30.013
The northern Midwest is seductive to me.

27:30.294 --> 27:31.094
I like the Midwest.

27:32.135 --> 27:35.318
You know, my wife and I are moving there in a few months.

27:35.339 --> 27:38.922
And I think it'll be a thousand-page hardcover book.

27:39.302 --> 27:39.943
Really?

27:40.818 --> 27:49.672
And you just have an idea of the shape and the scope, but really not what it is.

27:49.773 --> 27:51.656
I have no specifics on it.

27:51.676 --> 27:55.682
Are you working on more than one thing at a time?

27:55.702 --> 27:55.762
No.

27:55.782 --> 27:57.685
Are you really focused when you're doing this?

27:58.266 --> 28:02.714
I have the best concentration I've ever seen on a rider.

28:02.734 --> 28:03.335
I know how to think.

28:03.375 --> 28:04.817
I know how to sustain concentration.

28:05.793 --> 28:08.155
Is it a painting they ask for you, or is it hard?

28:08.175 --> 28:08.576
I love it.

28:08.616 --> 28:10.818
I mean, there's times when I don't want to do it, but I do it anyway.

28:12.200 --> 28:12.860
I like to work.

28:14.222 --> 28:15.423
Are you a rewriter?

28:15.523 --> 28:17.705
I rewrite and rewrite and rewrite, so I've got to be perfect.

28:17.725 --> 28:20.849
It's got to be seamless and perfect, or I'm more committed to it.

28:20.869 --> 28:22.230
And physically, how do you write?

28:22.390 --> 28:23.451
Word processor?

28:23.752 --> 28:24.312
I write by hand.

28:25.173 --> 28:29.758
I have a woman who types for me, who's been working for me for 13 years.

28:29.778 --> 28:33.522
Is that how long you've been in Connecticut, 13 years?

28:34.058 --> 28:39.246
I've been in suburban New York and Connecticut for 13 years, yeah.

28:39.266 --> 28:40.688
Was this a statement leaving L.A.

28:40.748 --> 28:43.532
for you, or is it just a... My first book was about to be published.

28:44.233 --> 28:48.720
I had never really been anywhere else, and I just wanted to get out of town.

28:48.740 --> 28:52.225
I mean, was it a symbolic thing, too?

28:52.245 --> 28:53.807
I mean... I wanted to get out.

28:53.847 --> 28:54.588
I'd been there too long.

28:56.872 --> 28:58.374
What if you hadn't sold the first couple books?

28:58.474 --> 29:00.016
What do you think would have become?

29:00.998 --> 29:02.580
I'd have kept writing.

29:03.607 --> 29:04.308
I mean, you're a writer.

29:04.889 --> 29:05.249
You do that.

29:05.449 --> 29:06.771
Yeah.

29:06.791 --> 29:07.532
How do you take editing?

29:08.453 --> 29:09.574
I take it okay.

29:09.594 --> 29:32.803
Sonny Mettet, Kate Knopf, understands books, understands the author's intentions, and has a deep feeling for my book, and he's a damn good editor, and his suggestions have been sound on the two books of mine that he's edited.

29:33.222 --> 29:37.528
And boy, he really, I mean, the quotes I've read, the guy is in awe of.

29:39.090 --> 29:42.896
At all, apparently he still maintained very cordial relationships.

29:42.916 --> 29:44.037
Oh, yeah, we're still good friends.

29:44.057 --> 29:45.820
Yeah, I saw Otto in New York on Monday.

29:47.001 --> 29:51.107
I mean, I guess he understood that you have to let the bird leave the nest, so to speak.

29:51.187 --> 29:52.409
Well, Knopf is Knopf.

29:52.469 --> 29:55.613
I mean, you know, what writer wouldn't give their eye teeth to go there?

29:55.633 --> 29:55.794
Sure.

29:56.815 --> 29:59.198
It's the biggest thrill of my career is being published by Knopf.

29:59.799 --> 30:00.100
Really?

30:00.260 --> 30:00.360
Yeah.

30:01.657 --> 30:03.880
That's a validation, isn't it, certainly?

30:04.621 --> 30:08.546
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:11.710 --> 30:13.112
Anything I should cover that I haven't?

30:13.152 --> 30:16.116
Tell me a little bit about this Y designation.

30:16.516 --> 30:17.878
Well, I think I'm moving out of it.

30:18.399 --> 30:19.821
You've read American Tablet.

30:20.662 --> 30:29.453
You know that at the end you've got Pete Bondurant, desperately in love, writing the whirlwind of history.

30:30.260 --> 30:35.528
and terrified, this terrible man, terrified, and holding on to this woman.

30:35.548 --> 30:40.996
And you've got Ward Littell, who has achieved great power at a terrible price.

30:41.998 --> 30:49.309
And I think I want to soften and humanize these guys over the course of the next book.

30:49.630 --> 30:53.395
And I think I'm moving away from the noir universe.

30:53.455 --> 30:56.520
I think I've taken noirs as far as it can go, and I think it's time to change.

30:57.597 --> 31:00.641
And I won't know really until I sit down and start plotting out that book.

31:01.122 --> 31:01.943
Here's a checklist.

31:01.963 --> 31:04.687
Yes, sir.

31:05.988 --> 31:07.430
You can take these before you know the chips.

31:07.450 --> 31:11.175
And they're real good and real addictive.

31:11.336 --> 31:12.377
The greasiest and the best.

31:13.358 --> 31:14.199
Wonderful.

31:16.182 --> 31:27.317
So, I think noir is largely designated as being a style, especially as far as the movies go.

31:28.377 --> 31:35.671
I think, I haven't read a lot of the noir novelists like David Goodis and David Thompson.

31:35.691 --> 31:44.970
I think I've created a new genre with historical noir, and I want to move away from it.

31:44.990 --> 31:48.136
So you have no, you're a young guy, you're 47.

31:48.216 --> 31:50.841
You're not that much older.

31:51.496 --> 31:51.756
51.

31:51.796 --> 31:53.499
51, yeah.

31:53.539 --> 31:54.620
Good age.

31:54.640 --> 31:55.221
52 this year.

31:55.301 --> 31:57.204
Got my first book coming out this summer.

31:57.224 --> 31:58.526
Congratulations.

31:58.826 --> 31:59.447
Who's publishing?

31:59.487 --> 31:59.768
Holt.

32:00.328 --> 32:01.490
What's it about?

32:01.510 --> 32:10.703
It's about bibliomania, believe it or not.
