00:02.140 --> 00:02.561
May 2.

00:05.064 --> 00:17.503
The Basket of Flowers, or Piety, P-I-E-T-Y, Piety, P-I-E-T-Y, and Truth Triumphant, translated from the German with illustrations.

00:17.744 --> 00:25.235
The Piety and Truth is sort of interesting there, because that was the point of a lot of books.

00:25.475 --> 00:28.300
The children's book as we know it today entertains the music.

00:28.320 --> 00:31.084
The earliest ones were taught and moralized.

00:34.726 --> 00:36.369
That's very nice.

00:36.389 --> 00:49.917
Richard H. U. N. E. Hun, The Story of Old London by George E. Sargent.

01:01.540 --> 01:08.170
I'm glad you're doing this, because I think she labored in obscurity for so long, and I think what she did was a masterful thing.

01:08.691 --> 01:10.493
I don't think it could ever be duplicated.

01:10.754 --> 01:17.304
For one thing, the price of the books has skyrocketed, and it would just take a fantastic fortune to buy it.

01:18.145 --> 01:27.659
And, you know, buying the books that have since disappeared, essentially, rather than pristine first edition is a real gift, too.

01:27.719 --> 01:31.024
I mean, when you think in 50 years, who's going to have 500 golden books from the mid-20s?

01:31.240 --> 01:32.943
Mid-20th century.

01:33.744 --> 01:34.726
Nobody but us.

01:34.926 --> 01:36.869
Yeah.

01:36.889 --> 01:42.318
And when you say, see, she collected these things when nobody else did.

01:42.338 --> 01:42.478
Mm-hmm.

01:42.498 --> 01:46.445
That's why she could go into a book dealer and say, I'll take 2,000 books.

01:46.465 --> 01:48.829
I'll take them all off your hands for $1,000.

01:48.849 --> 01:51.413
And he'd say, great.

01:51.713 --> 01:53.336
Did she keep records of her purchases?

01:54.598 --> 01:57.062
I'm not sure if she did or not.

01:58.375 --> 02:00.578
There's no way of knowing what she had into it.

02:00.598 --> 02:02.481
See, I have no idea what's in my collection.

02:02.581 --> 02:05.506
It's just a fragment of what hers was.

02:08.711 --> 02:09.732
Was she a frugal woman?

02:12.757 --> 02:20.329
Well, she didn't have a lot of places that her money was needed.

02:20.389 --> 02:25.817
I mean, when she was here in Gainesville, she had a nice condo on a lake.

02:26.708 --> 02:33.215
And she drove a fairly late model car, but her clothes certainly weren't that important to her.

02:34.195 --> 02:36.978
Did you have a circle of friends, or did you keep pretty much to yourself?

02:37.559 --> 02:41.723
She had some fairly good friends, yeah.

02:41.743 --> 02:53.695
But I think they sort of, it was her agenda, basically, I think, when they were together.

02:55.042 --> 02:57.445
book collecting, going around to antique places.

02:58.627 --> 02:59.968
Kindred spirits, I would agree.

03:00.850 --> 03:02.351
Yeah.

03:02.372 --> 03:12.865
You did say, and I don't know if I have the machine on, but she had a sense, you perceived a sense of her own self or self-importance.

03:12.885 --> 03:17.331
She perhaps really thought that she was creating something great and monumental.

03:17.451 --> 03:18.973
Is that what you were suggesting, do you think?

03:21.147 --> 03:22.448
Well, I don't know.

03:22.648 --> 03:27.733
I mean, I'm sure she had some idea of the value of it and what it was, you know, the importance of what it was.

03:28.154 --> 03:41.186
When I made that comment, I think it was more, her life was so focused on this that she didn't, I didn't get the sense that she had time or wanted to give time to much of anything else, including people.

03:43.469 --> 03:46.952
You know, this was, this really... It was a mission.

03:47.287 --> 03:48.248
Oh, yeah.

03:48.268 --> 03:49.029
Yeah, it was a mission.

03:49.049 --> 03:49.790
It was a passion.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.793
It was just the total focus of her life.

03:51.873 --> 03:53.455
I'm sorry I missed talking to her.

03:53.715 --> 03:55.157
Would you talk about it?

03:55.758 --> 03:57.099
I think she would have.

03:59.963 --> 04:00.404
I don't know.

04:00.424 --> 04:05.110
She may not have wanted a book to be written about the library, and she may have.

04:05.290 --> 04:06.191
That's hard for me to read.

04:06.211 --> 04:07.553
I don't know if she would have or not.

04:09.675 --> 04:14.121
I mean, if any kind of publicity is going to bring inquiry, I would imagine.

04:15.316 --> 04:16.918
So she might have felt like that.

04:16.978 --> 04:18.380
She might not have liked that.

04:18.420 --> 04:20.763
Although she felt underappreciated.

04:22.064 --> 04:22.945
And yet over here.

04:23.065 --> 04:23.666
Well, here.

04:23.686 --> 04:30.655
And yet she was in some respects the major roadblock.

04:30.675 --> 04:33.498
Do you want to ask her to call Gus?

04:35.400 --> 04:38.003
Do you want to see if he's there?

04:38.023 --> 04:41.408
Yeah, you can call him.

04:41.428 --> 04:43.250
Why not do it, though?

04:43.270 --> 04:43.450
Go ahead.

04:44.071 --> 04:55.566
Okay, this is the first inscription that stuck with me when I started cataloging the books and really made me think about the person who actually wrote it and why he bought that book and why he presented it to this person.

04:56.107 --> 04:58.610
And it's dated 1874, January 1st.

04:58.671 --> 05:00.873
And the first is spelled out, F-I-R-S-T.

05:00.894 --> 05:04.739
And the inscription reads, presented to Mrs. Drabble.

05:05.540 --> 05:06.982
D-R-A-B-L-E.

05:07.162 --> 05:08.003
One B.

05:08.118 --> 05:08.458
Right.

05:08.639 --> 05:09.880
D-R-A-B-L-E.

05:09.900 --> 05:10.020
Right.

05:10.320 --> 05:11.361
By Edward Bailey.

05:12.362 --> 05:13.003
B-A-I-L-E-Y.

05:13.303 --> 05:15.886
As a token of respect on her wedding day.

05:15.926 --> 05:17.207
Isn't that lovely?

05:17.407 --> 05:23.514
Now, we found it interesting, or I found it interesting, because I wondered why he had dressed her as Mrs. Drabble.

05:25.035 --> 05:26.116
Was that her married name?

05:27.598 --> 05:28.819
Was she had assumed that day?

05:28.959 --> 05:32.283
And it just made me think about what relationship... With such time either.

05:32.603 --> 05:34.645
No, Edward had had to Mrs. Drabble.

05:35.666 --> 05:37.568
Why he didn't call her by her first name,

05:37.885 --> 05:39.306
Was it a teacher or someone?

05:39.326 --> 05:44.211
In that case, it seemed sort of an odd gift to give as a wedding present.

05:44.231 --> 05:47.053
And the name of the book is A Child's Life of Our Savior.

05:47.093 --> 05:48.695
It's a biography of Jesus Christ.

05:48.795 --> 05:49.155
By?

05:49.796 --> 05:52.158
By Reverend J. Burbage.

05:52.478 --> 05:52.999
Reverend J. B-U-R-B-I-D-G.

05:53.019 --> 05:53.600
Oh, you've written that down.

05:53.980 --> 06:00.926
And another interesting thing about this book is that the inscription is upside down on the back flyleaf.

06:01.887 --> 06:03.489
And I assumed it was a mistake.

06:03.629 --> 06:04.990
And I wondered how he felt.

06:05.324 --> 06:14.716
when he realized that this book he had bought for this woman on her wedding day and so thoughtfully signed, and he closed it and he had discovered that he had done it upside down.

06:14.936 --> 06:15.557
He did it again.

06:15.737 --> 06:16.237
On the back.

06:17.859 --> 06:20.142
See, you know, it was that tag there.

06:20.162 --> 06:24.067
No, that was a... This may be a later bookseller.

06:24.087 --> 06:29.253
I have a feeling he just opened it up and very carefully wrote it out here.

06:30.535 --> 06:31.736
And here it was upside down.

06:31.756 --> 06:32.918
And he used her married name.

06:33.218 --> 06:34.740
He used her married name, yeah.

06:36.357 --> 06:37.438
That's great.

06:37.458 --> 06:39.721
And so you just have to wonder.

06:39.781 --> 06:40.581
You just have to wonder.

06:40.601 --> 06:41.482
That's what a book does.

06:41.683 --> 06:43.344
What is the relationship with these two people?

06:43.364 --> 06:48.349
See, this book had one life, and now it's got another life with the speculation more than 100 years later.

06:48.670 --> 06:49.691
Right.

06:49.771 --> 06:52.814
Just let me hold it for a second.

06:52.834 --> 06:54.696
Let's take a look at it.

06:54.716 --> 06:57.739
You did copy the stuff for me.

06:57.859 --> 06:59.121
And then it was signed, by the way.

06:59.741 --> 07:01.183
Well, that's a different name.

07:01.223 --> 07:04.086
That's a subsequent element, I think.

07:04.106 --> 07:05.988
So it had several lives, hasn't it?

07:06.008 --> 07:06.128
Right.

07:07.762 --> 07:08.303
Sheffield.

07:08.323 --> 07:08.943
I think it's British.

07:09.945 --> 07:11.547
It doesn't say the city, either, does it?

07:13.769 --> 07:18.115
Well, that's Sheffield is definitely English, I would guess.

07:18.335 --> 07:20.778
So it could be English, you know?

07:20.798 --> 07:20.938
Yeah.

07:20.958 --> 07:21.539
Probably is.

07:23.001 --> 07:23.521
Probably is.

07:23.541 --> 07:23.822
Go ahead.

07:23.842 --> 07:24.322
Say that again.

07:24.342 --> 07:27.406
I liked Dr. Baldwin to the core of her feisty little being.

07:27.626 --> 07:29.008
I think she was a wonderful person.

07:29.148 --> 07:30.850
She was not without a sense of humor.

07:30.890 --> 07:36.537
And the way she could focus in and go after these books was really an inspiration to me.

07:36.871 --> 07:38.974
How did she express her sense of humor?

07:39.174 --> 07:40.175
You said she had a sense of humor.

07:40.896 --> 07:45.001
Well, it was a little satirical and ironical.

07:45.121 --> 07:48.505
It was not slapstick by any stretch of the imagination.

07:50.628 --> 07:55.774
But she just would tell the most interesting stories, little ironies that had happened that she picked out.

07:55.874 --> 08:00.219
Did she have any good book stories about finding things, great finds type things like that?

08:00.239 --> 08:03.503
Well, not so much great finds, it was just interesting finds.

08:03.702 --> 08:20.631
For example, the bookstore in Michigan that she went into and bought the whole back room of children's books, and how she had to box them up and carry them by trips in her station wagon to this little cabin, which is where they happened to be at the time they were visiting this cabin in Michigan.

08:21.492 --> 08:24.117
And I'm sure her sister could give you many, many more.

08:24.137 --> 08:26.561
This story probably came up when she learned that you were from Michigan.

08:26.882 --> 08:27.162
Right.

08:27.952 --> 08:29.294
Oh, when I was in Michigan.

08:29.314 --> 08:30.034
Well, I grew up.

08:30.375 --> 08:34.880
I grew up on a farm around Champaign, and she grew up in Champaign.

08:35.100 --> 08:38.484
So you were probably talking about mutually familiar places.

08:38.504 --> 08:39.886
Yeah, well, it was interesting.

08:40.626 --> 08:46.113
She sat often in the afternoon and just talked to me about, you know, her life, her father, her sister.

08:46.173 --> 08:48.676
What did she say about her father?

08:48.696 --> 08:50.998
Anything you... A lot of what I've told you.

08:51.018 --> 08:55.123
Did she reveal sides of herself, or was she kind of protective?

08:56.116 --> 08:56.877
About her father?

08:56.957 --> 08:59.980
Well, about her private side, her family side.

09:00.981 --> 09:03.604
No, she was amazingly open.

09:03.684 --> 09:06.587
Well, she was very open about things that had happened to her.

09:06.627 --> 09:11.993
As far as how she felt about those things, she wasn't quite so forthcoming.

09:12.214 --> 09:19.341
But, I don't know, she was in a talkative mood some of those afternoons, and she'd tell stories.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.964
And I regret to this day I didn't have a tape recorder.

09:22.064 --> 09:23.286
Yeah, I wish she did.

09:23.426 --> 09:25.448
But I'm sure Cynthia could give you a lot of...

09:25.546 --> 09:26.527
That's the first time.

09:26.547 --> 09:27.087
Personal anecdotes, yeah.

09:27.127 --> 09:27.728
Melissa's downstairs.

09:27.748 --> 09:28.929
Do you mind if I chat with her briefly?

09:28.949 --> 09:30.290
She may not be down where we were.

09:30.350 --> 09:30.951
Okay.

09:31.872 --> 09:34.754
She is usually down on the first place.

09:34.774 --> 09:36.676
Melissa Davis, I think.

09:36.696 --> 09:40.440
And you worked with her for how long, would you say?

09:40.460 --> 09:41.400
About a year.

09:41.420 --> 09:45.444
Do you have any recollections of her, how you felt about her, what kind of lady she was?

09:46.245 --> 09:47.046
I thought she was great.

09:47.486 --> 09:51.710
She was very crusty, you know.

09:51.750 --> 09:52.150
Crusty?

09:52.370 --> 09:53.251
Crusty.

09:53.271 --> 09:55.333
You know, I mean, you didn't quite know

09:56.073 --> 09:59.177
how she would take you being around her.

09:59.197 --> 10:06.365
But I was always taught to respect my elders, and I never had her get angry at me.

10:06.405 --> 10:08.908
I mean, she did get angry easily.

10:09.128 --> 10:11.030
What kinds of things got her angry?

10:11.050 --> 10:12.312
Oh, anything.

10:12.332 --> 10:15.275
Anybody messing with her books, her collection.

10:15.395 --> 10:17.958
Messing with respect you're touching or handling?

10:18.378 --> 10:21.182
Getting near them, anything to do with her budget.

10:21.522 --> 10:21.963
Doing what?

10:22.023 --> 10:24.966
With her budget, or just generally

10:25.334 --> 10:26.496
I mean, the program.

10:27.157 --> 10:27.838
What was your job?

10:27.858 --> 10:29.140
What was your position?

10:29.160 --> 10:30.522
I was secretary.

10:30.542 --> 10:31.904
So you were kind of closely with her.

10:31.924 --> 10:33.366
Did she have a secretary with her?

10:33.386 --> 10:33.646
Yes, she did.

10:33.666 --> 10:36.411
What kinds of things amused her, would you say?

10:36.431 --> 10:38.213
I don't know.

10:38.233 --> 10:42.360
She would mainly talk to me about my kids.

10:42.460 --> 10:43.281
Did she like kids?

10:43.301 --> 10:45.504
Yes, she did.

10:45.604 --> 10:48.709
I'm told that she was kind of standoffish.

10:49.499 --> 10:51.942
She certainly didn't want any of them in your books, didn't she?

10:51.962 --> 10:52.282
Right.

10:52.623 --> 10:54.926
No, she did let my little boy come in.

10:55.266 --> 10:56.348
Your little boy?

10:57.068 --> 11:03.136
And she talked to him and she even gave him a couple of books that she had copies of.

11:03.416 --> 11:04.558
Oh, that was it.

11:04.838 --> 11:05.839
Were you surprised by that?

11:06.280 --> 11:08.763
Yeah, a little bit, because I didn't know how she would take it.

11:09.644 --> 11:15.912
She preferred him to be out in the annex, you know, where the not-so-valuable books are kept out.

11:16.077 --> 11:19.901
But she did let him use some of the books and look at them.

11:20.221 --> 11:23.664
Did she ever talk about her collection, her books?

11:23.684 --> 11:27.648
Do you remember anything she might have said about what she was doing, what she was trying to accomplish?

11:27.668 --> 11:28.289
Not really.

11:28.910 --> 11:31.272
And what was that gentleman?

11:31.472 --> 11:36.998
Can you just tell me what you were told about that story from the frat boy?

11:37.878 --> 11:39.620
I was trying to think about it.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.562
They told him to come in.

11:41.761 --> 11:46.085
A fellow from one of the fraternities came in, and he asked to see Dr. Baldwin.

11:46.565 --> 11:49.968
Yes, but I can't really remember.

11:50.889 --> 11:55.693
The story is that she was dead, I guess, at that point, and that he was relieved.

11:55.833 --> 12:00.837
And the reason he wanted to see her was because that's one of the initiation rites?

12:01.257 --> 12:05.661
Yeah, he had to come in to the library and ask her to use some of the books.

12:06.042 --> 12:11.346
And when I told him she had passed away, he was relieved, like you said.

12:11.663 --> 12:19.134
But I mean, that kind of tells you how scared they were of the reputation she had for eating people's heads off, right?

12:19.154 --> 12:20.616
And did she have a temper?

12:20.636 --> 12:21.237
Yes, she did.

12:21.578 --> 12:23.621
And when she showed it, how did she show it?

12:23.881 --> 12:24.322
She screamed.

12:25.003 --> 12:25.964
What kinds of things?

12:25.984 --> 12:26.766
She yelled.

12:27.026 --> 12:30.131
I mean, just whatever she wanted to say.

12:30.291 --> 12:33.536
I mean, she had no qualms about speaking her mind and letting me know.

12:33.696 --> 12:40.145
Tell me, like, what kind of thing would get a man that would really occasion her to really scream or something?

12:40.166 --> 12:40.506
Yeah.

12:41.212 --> 12:48.186
I saw just somebody, just a professor sending over a student to use a book to make her mad.

12:48.627 --> 12:49.228
She didn't like that.

12:49.569 --> 12:53.476
She didn't want students who were in her book.

12:53.496 --> 12:54.378
She did not.

12:55.741 --> 12:57.565
Okay, Melissa, I think that's good.

12:58.086 --> 12:58.486
That's great.

12:58.506 --> 12:59.288
Thank you very much.
