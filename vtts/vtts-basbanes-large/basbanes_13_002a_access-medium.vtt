WEBVTT

00:03.997 --> 00:14.793
the month of February, leaving our old location on Bryant Street south of Market, and moving over 100 tons of type by hand.

00:15.794 --> 00:31.337
That's aside from, you'll see lots of heavy equipment downstairs, which was moved by heavy machine removers, but we picked 100 tons of type cases,

00:32.212 --> 00:36.940
fonts and so forth, which we had to move essentially by hand.

00:36.960 --> 00:41.607
We had to take it out of the racks on Bryant Street, put it on dollies.

00:42.709 --> 00:45.794
Movers moved the dollies over to here, but then we had to pick it up again.

00:46.956 --> 00:47.958
Wow.

00:47.978 --> 00:49.340
Do you have more space here?

00:49.741 --> 00:50.041
Yes.

00:50.442 --> 00:54.068
We had 10,000 square feet of space on.

00:54.436 --> 00:59.163
Brian Street, and now we have 14.

00:59.183 --> 01:11.601
So it's 40% more, but the way the space is divided up, we have a bit less space for production.

01:12.683 --> 01:18.932
There's more space for the public and for gallery and display areas.

01:20.875 --> 01:23.399
Who's in Ariane?

01:23.419 --> 01:23.599
Ariane.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.580
the legendary Greek poet.

01:27.702 --> 01:30.305
Saved from the sea by a dolphin.

01:30.325 --> 01:42.640
It's a boy riding on a dolphin, but he's supposed to be a mature man with a lyre in hand.

01:42.660 --> 01:49.148
So it's a take off on the idea that the grab horn press would be

01:49.567 --> 01:54.454
the dolphin, foiling the horn, rather.

01:54.514 --> 01:55.676
Not the anchor, but the horn.

01:55.696 --> 01:58.340
The anchor was the Aldean press.

01:58.360 --> 01:59.021
And you're a poet.

01:59.181 --> 02:00.423
And so I'm the boy.

02:00.443 --> 02:04.228
I got it.

02:04.549 --> 02:14.663
This building had quite elephant for the Presidio Trust, and the real estate people were

02:15.250 --> 02:18.413
encouraged to find a space for it.

02:18.733 --> 02:21.396
Why would it be a white elephant?

02:21.416 --> 02:28.003
Well, it's an old boiler plant, steam plant, for the public health service hospital.

02:28.023 --> 02:29.244
It didn't look like it.

02:29.264 --> 02:31.406
There was a lot of demolitions that we did.

02:31.426 --> 02:37.312
There was a lot of industrial build-out in these spaces.

02:37.352 --> 02:44.599
There's the old boiler room beyond that heavy wall, and the new boiler room beyond this wall.

02:45.052 --> 02:47.596
which serves this building and the surrounding buildings.

02:48.317 --> 02:52.563
But they didn't think they could lease this building, certainly not the lower level.

02:53.404 --> 02:55.507
It suited our purposes.

02:56.288 --> 03:06.303
We have three departments, a Tide Foundry, Composing Room, Press Room, where we are now, and then Book Findery, and linked by along corridors.

03:06.343 --> 03:10.830
All of the staff of the Labyrinth have a school thinking.

03:11.370 --> 03:14.535
Should Jerry and some people come in here, too?

03:15.545 --> 03:18.689
Oh, let them eat their cake, as they say.

03:19.711 --> 03:21.894
Where have I heard that before?

03:21.914 --> 03:24.777
It's a coin of race.

03:25.919 --> 03:27.782
So this is central to everything.

03:27.802 --> 03:28.923
So are you happy here?

03:28.943 --> 03:33.629
Oh, ecstatic.

03:33.689 --> 03:42.261
We were able to arrange things in the best order we could conceive of, where we were before we were

03:43.338 --> 03:51.706
We joined McKinsey and Harrisburg Type Foundry to sort of put our things down in and among their things.

03:51.886 --> 04:04.258
And here we were able to really place the presses and the type cases and the worktops in places where they would be most efficiently used.

04:05.219 --> 04:12.045
This is a large two-color cylinder press that we used for most of our printing work.

04:12.683 --> 04:13.844
This is Louis Mitchell.

04:14.125 --> 04:14.505
Hi, Louis.

04:14.926 --> 04:17.809
Who's been working for Mackenzie and Harris for over 50 years.

04:19.571 --> 04:30.344
He's our mainstay back in the type country.

04:31.325 --> 04:32.747
We make new type all the time.

04:32.887 --> 04:34.489
Were you casting type today, Louis?

04:35.887 --> 04:38.270
Your design type as well?

04:38.451 --> 04:40.994
I want to sometimes lend myself to advise.

04:42.116 --> 04:42.617
This one.

04:45.841 --> 04:51.670
This is a job that we are practicing.

04:51.690 --> 04:52.731
It should be so warm.

04:53.292 --> 04:54.053
Just slightly warm.

04:54.354 --> 04:55.576
Keyboarding and casting.

04:55.596 --> 04:57.639
This is monotype composition.

04:58.279 --> 05:01.504
Individual letters, just like Antet talk.

05:02.886 --> 05:05.590
Do you know the difference between the monotype and the linotype?

05:06.059 --> 05:08.983
I used to work with in the newspapers.

05:09.023 --> 05:30.230
So it casts individual letters just like that, much superior to the linotype, which has, as you know, raised letters on a slug.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.914
This is a two-part operation.

05:33.074 --> 05:33.855
So we have

05:34.308 --> 05:42.344
to have a keyboard operator who punches the paper tape on a machine, which is then transported to the casting machine.

05:43.206 --> 05:49.278
And punched holes tell the casting machine which letter or space to cast an order.

05:53.426 --> 05:55.590
So, there's one of his...

05:56.313 --> 05:57.274
percentage mark.

05:57.314 --> 05:59.037
Now is it down to the keyboard?

05:59.518 --> 06:01.120
Yeah, you'll see that when you get down.

06:01.781 --> 06:12.337
Along this wall we have many of the historic types that we inherited from the grab horn press.

06:13.478 --> 06:17.945
Many of these types go back to the turn of the century and even back into the 19th century.

06:18.826 --> 06:25.476
Types that came to the grab horns from John Henry Nash, a famous printer from the turn of the century to

06:27.008 --> 06:35.817
And then also some of the types that they got from him after he went bankrupt in his 30s.

06:36.118 --> 06:43.866
And I was interested in talking about the types found in Europe and how some of these represent the best cuttings.

06:45.467 --> 06:46.008
Right.

06:46.068 --> 06:50.973
The Grabhorns tried to buy the best version of the type.

06:52.975 --> 06:54.737
The Bauer of Bodoni, for example.

06:54.953 --> 07:01.319
which they consider to be the best modern re-cutting that they're doing these types of stuff they bought.

07:02.481 --> 07:07.926
And many of the types here are replaceable because some of these type foundries— They're irreplaceable?

07:08.267 --> 07:12.771
Yeah, because the type foundries have either gone out of business or destroyed in the war.

07:13.452 --> 07:20.279
So when you want to make a new set of type, how do you actually get the design into the machine?

07:20.299 --> 07:21.420
To be built.

07:22.481 --> 07:23.442
So when he's making—

07:23.793 --> 07:31.790
What he's casting is pre-existing matrices from pre-existing matrices.

07:31.810 --> 07:34.075
So these are here and that's it?

07:34.576 --> 07:38.084
You can't replicate these?

07:38.124 --> 07:44.097
So here you have a complete alphabet with different sizes.

07:44.431 --> 07:55.538
And by irreplaceable, what Sandy was referring to is that the type foundry that originally cast them was destroyed in World War II or has been dismantled.

07:55.558 --> 07:59.568
So you're not going to get this made again.

08:00.229 --> 08:00.550
You know.

08:01.913 --> 08:14.307
The M and H type foundry, you have matrices for casting both letters for hand setting and monotype composition, which you just saw.

08:14.708 --> 08:17.911
So the handset, there's a huge collection of matrices here.

08:18.292 --> 08:22.236
Those types can continue to be made.

08:22.416 --> 08:28.343
And you remake them because you sort of run out of things or you run out of things?

08:29.167 --> 08:31.990
Type will become worn.

08:32.571 --> 08:36.374
And we also sell types to Tuscaners all over the country.

08:36.855 --> 08:38.757
So that's why we're constantly casting.

08:38.817 --> 08:42.201
It's not just for our own use.

08:42.221 --> 08:55.174
But if we run out of the type in a case, or in a face that we can supply here, Lewis Mitchell can cast more for us.

08:55.745 --> 08:58.028
You still sell type.

08:58.048 --> 08:58.909
I used to buy type.

08:58.989 --> 09:09.022
What we hear is that this is really the best source of type in the world.

09:10.264 --> 09:21.198
These are type cases, but we're using it more temporarily as shelving for fonts that we're putting on sale at half off.

09:21.879 --> 09:24.402
We've got excess inventory that we realize

09:24.854 --> 09:29.563
We need to move since we make the move.

09:30.425 --> 09:35.274
And just feel how heavy one of these things is.

09:35.795 --> 09:36.216
Wow.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.282
But these are all labels, are they not?

09:39.462 --> 09:41.025
Now, you absorb this other company?

09:41.706 --> 09:46.896
Well, we bought the type foundry back in the late 80s.

09:47.585 --> 09:52.911
And it was just about to go out of business, and we managed to save it.

09:52.931 --> 09:53.812
You moved all of this over?

09:53.972 --> 09:55.394
This is part of the 150,000... Right.

09:55.414 --> 09:59.619
Oh, wow, look at this, huh?

09:59.639 --> 10:04.525
We're getting this kind of space in San Francisco in the late 1920s.

10:04.545 --> 10:05.266
It's amazing.

10:05.286 --> 10:07.729
It's amazing.

10:07.749 --> 10:12.114
Here's your monochrome, and this is the Matrix case.

10:12.214 --> 10:12.634
I see.

10:13.495 --> 10:17.440
And what happens is you have paper that has two holes in one hole.

10:17.960 --> 10:19.722
Moved it so far one, so far the other.

10:19.822 --> 10:21.544
Almost like a player piano.

10:22.405 --> 10:23.286
It works that way.

10:24.788 --> 10:28.652
This is wonderful.

10:28.672 --> 10:35.800
It almost looks like it was designed for you, you know?

10:36.020 --> 10:39.084
It really does.

10:39.104 --> 10:43.449
Presidio didn't even know they had this room available.

10:43.589 --> 10:44.490
Were you kept after them?

10:44.673 --> 10:50.902
They opened a few doors and said, with this, we can make it half a block.

10:50.922 --> 10:53.566
It's just perfectly fine.

10:53.746 --> 10:58.973
And we now have natural light in all the workspaces.

10:59.133 --> 11:05.002
We were in this dark warehouse building before.

11:05.022 --> 11:06.103
This is your keyboard.

11:06.123 --> 11:10.249
This is your Roman cap figure, lowercase.

11:10.269 --> 11:10.950
Small cap.

11:11.926 --> 11:33.073
italic on this side where's the italics how would you do it would you do a bold face here too i mean you could do that too right uh so we have

11:33.796 --> 11:39.021
You have different layouts.

11:39.081 --> 11:43.766
See, this one doesn't have what I want, but I'll show you.

11:44.827 --> 11:47.470
Let me get the other one down.

11:47.510 --> 11:48.130
This is fine.

11:48.270 --> 11:49.752
That was a dumb question.

11:49.832 --> 11:53.696
I'm sorry.

11:53.716 --> 11:59.742
This one here, you have your Roman on this side, and you have your bull face on this side.

11:59.902 --> 12:00.563
You change it.

12:01.003 --> 12:02.925
I see.

12:04.407 --> 12:05.108
13.

12:09.713 --> 12:10.915
How old are these machines?

12:10.955 --> 12:12.116
Like, how old?

12:12.136 --> 12:12.437
Okay.

12:12.837 --> 12:19.906
Now, this one here, you have your Roman, Italic, and Bullface in this one.

12:19.926 --> 12:21.007
This is Times Roman.

12:22.689 --> 12:28.676
He's pointing out that you can arrange the layout so that the keys will respond.

12:29.417 --> 12:34.363
All these bars over here, you change these.

12:35.035 --> 12:41.002
You put these underneath.

12:41.623 --> 12:43.806
You put these in underneath there.

12:44.747 --> 12:47.630
And these correspond to the matrix case.

12:48.531 --> 12:58.003
And then we have different ones on the top there that designate between Roman, Metallic, and Versace.

12:58.023 --> 13:02.168
And I interrupted you while you were typing, and I couldn't... No, no, no, that's it.

13:02.188 --> 13:03.810
I was just showing you here how it works.

13:04.432 --> 13:20.440
And what happens is, when you get to the end of the line, they're on it.

13:20.460 --> 13:28.273
Now, you can get that 814, that line would come in within 1,007 inch.

13:28.333 --> 13:29.916
Those are the justifiers.

13:30.200 --> 13:33.344
We hit that, and that would put a spacing between each one.

13:33.664 --> 13:35.467
Pre-computer, computer, right?

13:35.547 --> 13:35.807
Right.

13:35.847 --> 13:38.110
Basically, this is what it is.

13:38.430 --> 13:59.397
And when HP first started and Adobe, they came here and they paid us to have their men here for a whole month to learn how type was made, how it was designed, how you put pieces of type together on the floor and also back in here so that they could perfect their system.

13:59.849 --> 14:05.835
So this is late 19th century technology.

14:05.855 --> 14:06.716
It really is.

14:07.396 --> 14:11.460
And it's still the best.

14:11.480 --> 14:18.587
There are those who say that the monotypes were the highest achievement of the Industrial Revolution.

14:19.388 --> 14:22.611
This is very efficient.

14:23.672 --> 14:29.738
Does it predate the linotype or does it come after the linotype?

14:30.190 --> 14:33.193
It comes after, I believe.

14:33.753 --> 14:37.998
There were so many systems for time and machine composition being developed.

14:38.018 --> 14:41.681
You know, Mark Twain lost a lot of money on it.

14:41.701 --> 14:45.325
He turned in a manuscript and a typewriter, in fact, didn't he?

14:45.425 --> 14:48.027
Actually, this is the original typewriter.

14:48.808 --> 14:51.611
It was straight up and down this way instead of on an angle.

14:51.731 --> 14:56.856
You know, the way a computer... Yeah, it's got the standard QWERTY... It's still the same.

14:57.275 --> 15:05.587
But the original typewriter, this is the way they had it, straight up and down.

15:05.748 --> 15:08.592
And then they changed it so that it would be faster.

15:08.612 --> 15:10.995
But Monotype never changed it.

15:11.015 --> 15:13.679
Even the last ones that they made were still this way.

15:13.759 --> 15:18.306
When did they start making these machines?

15:19.748 --> 15:22.933
Now, it was about six or seven years ago.

15:22.953 --> 15:27.079
The English Monotype Company sold the last one that they had.

15:27.835 --> 15:32.840
If you have to have repairs, you have to make your own.

15:33.041 --> 15:33.801
That's my job.

15:34.542 --> 15:37.005
And if I can't get the part, then I make it.

15:37.285 --> 15:41.990
I have a small little machine shop at home where I've had to make a few of the parts.

15:42.070 --> 15:44.473
How many motor types do you have on these machines?

15:44.493 --> 15:51.340
Well, I have these two that are used all the time, and then I have two spares that are in the other room we can move into place if we need them.

15:51.921 --> 15:55.024
If one breaks down and I don't have time to repair it,

15:55.696 --> 15:56.477
Lift these up.

15:56.677 --> 15:57.999
They come off this pedestal.

15:58.821 --> 16:02.426
We just lift them right off, and we put the other one in place and go.

16:02.666 --> 16:06.752
How many of these do you think are still in operation, professional operation?

16:06.772 --> 16:07.333
Professional?

16:07.774 --> 16:09.897
Yeah.

16:11.199 --> 16:14.223
Maybe four, six at the most professional.

16:14.243 --> 16:18.950
But now you have a lot of amateurs that have these in their basements and in their garages.

16:19.030 --> 16:22.395
In fact, there's quite a few back east that have them in barns.

16:22.747 --> 16:31.276
Let me show you the matrix, then, what we have.

16:31.476 --> 16:37.322
Nobody can compete with us for this reason.

16:37.402 --> 16:44.429
Each one of those is a matrix case.

16:45.070 --> 16:46.531
And that's not all of them.

16:46.551 --> 16:51.977
I have probably a thousand more of them upstairs in this room up above here where the air compressor is.

16:52.413 --> 16:56.319
that we just don't have room for them here, but I know where they are.

16:56.459 --> 16:59.143
I've got a list where they are, and I can go run right up there and get them.

17:00.205 --> 17:10.420
You know, we got a designation from the National Trust for Historic Preservation, and the reigning concept here, as you can imagine, really is the mold.

17:10.440 --> 17:13.425
We have this extraordinarily complete

17:13.810 --> 17:16.012
This is an archive as much as it is.

17:16.073 --> 17:25.964
Yes, an archive, and once the molds are gone, there can't be any more, and so this is a really invaluable resource.

17:26.004 --> 17:27.385
That could be the angle for me.

17:27.425 --> 17:34.754
These are the larger typefaces for handset type.

17:34.954 --> 17:41.421
Down here on the machines on the left here is where we make the handset type.

17:46.227 --> 17:54.655
There is some spectrum that is just being run now, 18-point spectrum italic.

17:55.516 --> 17:59.881
Is this an anachronism in your view?

18:00.321 --> 18:00.521
No.

18:00.621 --> 18:08.970
I mean, it's still a perfectly viable way of doing predicts.

18:08.990 --> 18:10.011
Is it cost effective?

18:11.352 --> 18:14.395
On short runs, definitely.

18:14.780 --> 18:17.103
OK, here's the example.

18:17.344 --> 18:27.037
If we were going to do an elaborate book and produce, say, 250 to 400 copies, this is perfect.

18:27.057 --> 18:28.118
This is perfect.

18:28.138 --> 18:39.113
Because if you were to do it on the computer, and then you'd have to make plates, all the set up and make ready, and then only print a few copies.

18:39.714 --> 18:41.817
Here's a little souvenir picture.

18:42.320 --> 18:47.346
Your flag and your liberty bell worked with a stamp band.

18:49.289 --> 19:03.467
They grew them in an acid bath, and then they dovetailed those in, and they just regularly dovetailed those right into a piece of brass.

19:03.886 --> 19:07.191
stamped those in brass and then comb plated.

19:07.432 --> 19:08.133
So that's brass?

19:08.293 --> 19:12.460
This is brass inside and then comb plated.

19:13.001 --> 19:14.463
But this is brass.

19:15.785 --> 19:20.152
Now what are you setting over here?

19:20.392 --> 19:21.474
What would this be?

19:21.895 --> 19:26.502
Okay, this is Bodoni's book.

19:27.022 --> 19:31.608
In other words, what you do when you get through, you take a line of each one of these, and that makes a font of type.

19:32.389 --> 19:36.013
I'm not through yet.

19:36.694 --> 19:40.559
Down here, we've got a special order for some calendar mats.

19:40.979 --> 19:42.561
And this was the overrun.

19:42.601 --> 19:52.414
I always run extra so that when we get ready to make up the font and I look at it, if I find something that is bad, I can just grab one out and do it.

19:52.594 --> 19:55.037
I always run at least four or five overrun on...

19:55.270 --> 19:57.893
something like this, where you have those fine lines around the edge.

19:59.454 --> 20:01.256
And we go that route.

20:01.276 --> 20:11.245
And down here we have the largest type that we made, which is 72-point centaur.

20:11.265 --> 20:12.907
72-point, huh?

20:12.927 --> 20:18.512
72-point centaur, and that's the much bigger matrixes.

20:18.532 --> 20:24.518
Now, again, we've got the English matrixes on this machine, but we do have lots of American

20:25.291 --> 20:36.362
And these racks, both sides, just filled with matrixes, which you can't even buy anymore.

20:36.382 --> 20:38.825
And so date these for me, if you would.

20:40.867 --> 20:45.111
I'm using one down there that has a date in 1921.

20:45.191 --> 20:50.657
Well, you've also got a casting machine over here that came

20:51.548 --> 20:54.551
to the Panama Pacific Exposition, 1915.

20:54.711 --> 20:57.774
And it's still in operation.

20:58.434 --> 21:00.896
The best machine I've got.

21:00.916 --> 21:01.357
What is that?

21:01.377 --> 21:01.957
The machine again?

21:02.097 --> 21:03.058
That's this one right here.

21:03.078 --> 21:03.879
What do you call it?

21:03.899 --> 21:04.600
Tell me what it is.

21:05.801 --> 21:08.403
It's a composition machine.

21:08.803 --> 21:11.526
I just cut the metal part off, so don't touch it.

21:11.546 --> 21:12.266
It's still hot.

21:13.447 --> 21:13.988
Oops.

21:14.008 --> 21:15.830
Don't touch it.

21:16.450 --> 21:17.871
I just finished.

21:17.891 --> 21:19.693
This was the one that you just saw after.

21:19.713 --> 21:20.914
I just finished running it.

21:21.333 --> 21:23.857
So this is how the company was started.

21:24.678 --> 21:35.193
The Lanston Monotype Company sent a representative with sample machinery to the Panama Pacific Exposition, and he remained in San Francisco.

21:35.273 --> 21:36.034
And that was when?

21:36.054 --> 21:36.795
1915.

21:36.815 --> 21:37.736
1915.

21:38.257 --> 21:40.040
So it's an old company here in town.

21:40.581 --> 21:47.130
George McKenzie was the name, and he was joined in the early 20s by Carol T. Harris.

21:47.611 --> 21:50.715
They formed the partnership of McKenzie and Harris.

21:51.421 --> 21:53.684
So that's where you get the name, M&H Tide.

21:56.348 --> 21:59.572
And so give me an idea of the kinds of jobs that you get there.

21:59.592 --> 22:11.149
Not all fine-pressed books by, I mean, it's regular professional commercial work that people... Well, these days, there's less and less book work being done.

22:11.730 --> 22:19.200
And the composition side of the Tide Foundry is not as active as it once was.

22:19.754 --> 22:23.858
There are more people using computer-generated typography.

22:24.459 --> 22:31.225
And if they're letterpress printers, many of them are using photopalmer plates for their printing.

22:32.406 --> 22:40.414
But we continue to use this, and many other printers do too, because it's far superior to what can be generated on the computer.

22:40.975 --> 22:45.559
We're using the classic faces and able to get a better impression.

22:46.366 --> 22:49.510
So the superiority does come in the impression that you get.

22:51.052 --> 22:53.074
And also the ability to make changes.

22:53.115 --> 23:01.465
If you find that you've made a mistake in a computer-generated job, you've got a page here, you've got a plate made.

23:01.886 --> 23:03.067
The plate is expensive.

23:03.768 --> 23:07.292
If there's a mistake, you have to go back and make a little more plate.

23:07.312 --> 23:09.335
Here, we can change a letter or two.

23:11.318 --> 23:12.058
Thank you, Louis.

23:12.379 --> 23:12.880
Thank you, Sarah.

23:13.400 --> 23:14.061
Appreciate it.

23:14.328 --> 23:15.630
Nice technique.

23:15.670 --> 23:16.191
Good to see you.

23:18.193 --> 23:23.340
Is there any relationship to the paper tape and the piano roll?

23:23.360 --> 23:24.142
Well, absolutely.

23:24.242 --> 23:31.151
I mean, it's the same technology was developed in the 19th century.

23:31.271 --> 23:35.217
We're working on a book about the history of M.H.

23:35.317 --> 23:35.617
type.

23:35.898 --> 23:38.421
And that all will be revealed.

23:38.441 --> 23:40.224
And people come here.

23:40.264 --> 23:43.288
The knitting machine, the weaving machine.

23:43.268 --> 23:50.935
The design department from Adobe has been coming here for years to study the historic spaces.

23:51.096 --> 24:09.293
And a good analogy is with photography and the generations of prints, beginning with the original negative, the original negative being like the metal type, where as a piece of structure in metal, it has the form with

24:09.627 --> 24:11.990
the ability to cast shadows.

24:12.210 --> 24:13.752
More of the things.

24:13.832 --> 24:22.762
So what you see behind the temporary shelving of fonts on the left are cases like this.

24:23.202 --> 24:24.504
It's a vast type collection.

24:24.524 --> 24:26.967
There are 4,000 cases.

24:31.932 --> 24:38.740
You can go into a library and find one of the great printed books and photograph the page.

24:39.040 --> 24:42.969
and have computer-generated time made from the photograph.

24:43.009 --> 24:46.418
But of course, you're losing so much.

24:46.778 --> 24:52.071
You want to study the metal type.

24:52.675 --> 24:56.840
Boy, this is fantastic.

24:56.860 --> 25:11.897
One of the reason Andrew wanted to do the Bible was that, this was before the moving crisis, he had the type foundry, he had everything set up to do this tour de force of printing with letterpress.

25:12.017 --> 25:16.843
And there just wasn't the sense that he would be able to keep it all together.

25:16.823 --> 25:20.186
Unfortunately, he hasn't been able to keep it all together, but we didn't know that.

25:20.206 --> 25:20.987
Is the Bible done now?

25:21.067 --> 25:22.429
Are they Bible printed?

25:22.449 --> 25:25.972
Yes, and we really want you to see that.

25:26.633 --> 25:28.175
We're talking about the Bible.

25:28.275 --> 25:29.616
The Bible seems bad.

25:29.636 --> 25:31.919
So you're still producing Bibles.

25:31.939 --> 25:43.050
We finished the printing on the last day of August in 2000, around the first copies that fall.

25:43.773 --> 25:47.077
But it's a long, interminable process.

25:47.097 --> 25:52.963
With our whole crew here, we're able to get about three books a week found.

25:53.003 --> 25:53.464
That's it?

25:54.265 --> 25:56.227
Very labor intensive.

25:56.247 --> 25:56.727
Wow, hey.

25:57.869 --> 26:02.994
So there's a copy being sewn by hand.

26:03.014 --> 26:12.885
And here's a copy that's been sewn and is now being rounded to the next station.

26:16.173 --> 26:23.122
So the sewing of this step in here, right, is the next logical one.

26:25.425 --> 26:25.586
Right.

26:27.769 --> 26:27.829
Hi.

26:27.849 --> 26:34.417
So here, this is a book just beginning to be sewn with linen thread over linen tape.

26:34.438 --> 26:37.361
These are copies that have been sewn and have just been glued up.

26:38.223 --> 26:40.045
And here are copies that have been round.

26:40.065 --> 26:41.467
These are all hand sewn.

26:41.867 --> 26:43.289
And back.

26:43.309 --> 26:45.252
And the next step here will be

26:45.687 --> 26:49.051
to sew on the silk headbands.

26:51.213 --> 26:54.237
Please, you sew each signature, is that what it is?

26:54.277 --> 26:55.018
Each section.

26:55.198 --> 26:55.718
Each section.

26:55.738 --> 26:59.483
The section is... The signature is the printed sheet.

26:59.503 --> 27:01.685
That's right, but that's like 16 pages, right?

27:01.745 --> 27:09.834
Well, in this case it's 20 pages, so that we would have five, four-page signatures making up a sewing section.

27:09.854 --> 27:10.035
I see.

27:10.335 --> 27:13.078
And now the section's three times, so she goes right.

27:13.480 --> 27:14.621
And that's another machine.

27:14.701 --> 27:17.645
That's another person.

27:17.965 --> 27:18.286
Really?

27:18.326 --> 27:21.209
Working with that cradle.

27:22.090 --> 27:23.612
No, just beyond the cradle.

27:25.194 --> 27:27.737
The whole binding process is done by Hingon.

27:27.877 --> 27:30.720
So how long will it take you to do one volume normally?

27:30.740 --> 27:32.242
A volume like this?

27:32.462 --> 27:33.203
About three and a half hours.

27:33.504 --> 27:37.508
Well, so she can sew a book a day.

27:37.528 --> 27:40.652
And...

27:41.189 --> 27:44.072
What happens if they're absolutely all in order, right?

27:45.793 --> 27:47.094
Does it ever happen?

27:47.134 --> 27:48.356
No, that's all I'm saying.

27:48.376 --> 27:49.036
It must happen.

27:49.396 --> 27:52.279
Collating was one of the great feats.

27:52.299 --> 27:54.181
Then you have the rare variant.

27:54.201 --> 27:55.342
Well, that's right.

27:55.622 --> 27:56.803
What happens if you find that?

27:56.823 --> 28:06.932
Well, we did have a rare variant here within the last month, and it's really helpful.

28:06.992 --> 28:09.795
Is it worth it just to...

28:10.535 --> 28:11.236
forget about it?

28:11.256 --> 28:11.316
No.

28:12.258 --> 28:13.019
Take it apart and do it.

28:13.039 --> 28:18.087
It would have been if this had not been a copy with illuminated initial letters.

28:18.127 --> 28:20.391
That would have to be the case, right?

28:20.411 --> 28:23.295
Yeah, we have only 150 copies that are hand illuminated.

28:25.759 --> 28:28.784
No, this is not hand illuminated.

28:28.844 --> 28:32.129
The standard issue is with red initial letters.

28:32.770 --> 28:37.538
So there are 250 with red initial letters and 150 with

28:37.653 --> 28:39.456
gold and colors applied by hand.

28:39.476 --> 28:41.880
So what goes through first, the black or the red?

28:41.900 --> 28:50.693
Actually, in the press run, because we have a two-color press, it's the red that's printed first and the black second, but it's one pass.

28:51.415 --> 28:52.216
It is one pass.

28:55.461 --> 28:56.202
Well, that's good.

28:58.662 --> 29:02.207
So the printing took, what, a year and a half?

29:02.227 --> 29:06.734
Do you have to check every sheet that comes out to make sure that that red is aligned properly?

29:06.754 --> 29:10.380
Well, I was on the press throughout our printing.

29:10.700 --> 29:12.102
There were two of us running the press.

29:13.044 --> 29:16.749
And I was checking the sheets as they came into the delivery tray.

29:17.390 --> 29:20.234
And what are you gluing, the end sheets?

29:20.274 --> 29:27.285
We're gluing the end of the book so that there is some adhesive just barely between the sections.

29:28.227 --> 29:29.489
Oh, okay.

29:30.410 --> 29:34.436
And also glues to seal and strengthen the back of the book.

29:34.456 --> 29:37.922
And that's an old-timey thing, too, that people do.

29:37.942 --> 29:38.062
Right.

29:38.082 --> 29:40.566
Are these made to order, basically?

29:42.248 --> 29:44.131
Bound order, in a way.

29:44.612 --> 29:47.376
People have a choice of one volume or two volumes.

29:48.077 --> 29:52.804
They have the choice of whether they want initial letters or not, illuminated.

29:53.085 --> 29:57.171
And they also have the choice of...

29:57.455 --> 30:25.875
having a special dedication page at the beginning which you will print so are we making a dummy here does it have all the yellow paper in it so this is the next

30:26.176 --> 30:44.357
This is the next book we're going to be doing, which has a yellow cover, but it will look very different when we go to bind it because it will have sort of emblematic workshop images printed like so on the yellow.

30:44.377 --> 30:45.719
They'll be stamped or printed?

30:45.779 --> 30:46.320
Printed.

30:47.081 --> 30:50.284
And then the book is, well, these are all waste sheets.

30:53.007 --> 30:56.031
The book will have whole sheets of

30:56.804 --> 31:02.874
yellow, thin yellow paper for photogravures found into the book.

31:03.555 --> 31:04.397
What's the title?

31:04.637 --> 31:10.527
It's called The Ballad of Lemon and Crow by Glenn Todd and the artist is Bruce Conner.

31:12.951 --> 31:20.303
We're also thinking hard about how we're going to do a slip paste or an enclosure for the book.

31:20.563 --> 31:23.368
Are these Conner's designs?

31:25.323 --> 31:29.828
He makes these inkblot drawings by folding the paper.

31:32.111 --> 31:36.115
Are those reduced or are those that fit?

31:36.776 --> 31:39.959
Those are a full scale.

31:39.979 --> 31:45.365
They're very complicated.

31:45.385 --> 31:46.727
You asked about the dedication.

31:46.747 --> 31:53.334
And here we have, I believe, the last copy of Arcadia.

31:53.635 --> 31:53.895
Of Arcadia.

31:55.445 --> 31:59.730
The binders are always working on two or three projects at once.

31:59.750 --> 32:01.172
That's great that you have the work.

32:02.434 --> 32:16.972
Just imagine a lot of people who are interested in the binders are doing it because they think that this is an appropriate family area or an object that they can hand down.

32:17.153 --> 32:20.817
Are there individuals buying it so much as institutions are?

32:21.098 --> 32:24.642
A lot of individuals, and the thing I find

32:25.280 --> 32:50.275
interesting is that these are not necessarily conventionally religious people, but they're attracted to the idea of having a precious work of art in the family, and I think it's a wonderful thing that they think of a book, you know, they think of a book, and it sort of takes you back to the idea of the Bible as an aesthetic object

32:50.457 --> 33:05.200
representing literature for people, really no matter what their denominations are.

33:05.220 --> 33:18.220
Well, this is a small job that we're doing right now, an invitation to a meeting of this artist book council that supports the artist book collection of the fine arts museums.

33:30.265 --> 33:55.243
so there's two passes through as we say that's a red right in that case then he has to do two passes because that's what i was asking about the bible i mean did you print up x number of bibles or did you more or less sell them before no well we did a certain amount of pre-selling but i had to make a decision about the edition because i mean

33:55.477 --> 33:58.821
You don't want to keep too much of that inventory around waiting to sell it either.

33:59.401 --> 34:03.366
Well, you have to print the whole edition in months, of course.

34:03.386 --> 34:03.867
That's right.

34:04.087 --> 34:12.336
So we determined that we would publish 400 copies, and we bought paper accordingly.

34:12.356 --> 34:13.778
It was a big investment.

34:14.218 --> 34:20.666
And we also decided we would hand-illuminate the 150 copies, which also was a big investment.

34:21.447 --> 34:24.370
But we didn't invest in the binding all at once.

34:25.025 --> 34:26.127
Not that we could.

34:26.147 --> 34:28.670
Oh, you had three different kinds of bindings in any case.

34:28.750 --> 34:29.471
Yeah, right.

34:29.491 --> 34:33.557
So you had to see what the... What, what the people wanted in cloth or leather.

34:34.458 --> 34:39.465
That's a museum piece, isn't it?

34:39.485 --> 34:39.645
Yeah.

34:39.705 --> 34:40.526
That's a really good show.

34:40.847 --> 34:41.027
Yeah.

34:41.408 --> 34:44.011
We have Bruce Rogers portrayed up here.

34:45.513 --> 34:49.659
And a library where we... Good for you.

34:50.260 --> 34:52.703
Really, what a nice resolution to a...

34:53.746 --> 35:01.115
I just wanted to show some of the pages from the Bible.

35:01.175 --> 35:04.939
Individuals are buying it.

35:04.959 --> 35:05.961
Libraries are buying it.

35:05.981 --> 35:15.112
The main purpose of this, this is just a demonstration, is for liturgical use.

35:15.232 --> 35:16.834
It's a book that's made.

35:16.914 --> 35:20.418
These are the letters.

35:21.039 --> 35:23.061
She those are gorgeous.

35:24.121 --> 35:26.825
Local illuminators?

35:27.025 --> 35:28.206
Yeah, it was done.

35:28.246 --> 35:29.768
The design was worked out.

35:30.469 --> 35:33.613
Well, first of all, the initial letters were done by Sumner Stone.

35:33.693 --> 35:34.274
That's beautiful.

35:34.715 --> 35:40.402
And then Thomas Ingmeyer joined us on the illumination.

35:40.522 --> 35:42.825
Sumner Stone did the lettering for the word Bible.

35:42.845 --> 35:46.931
The rest of the type is Jan van Kruppen's Romulus.

35:51.356 --> 35:53.419
So it's designed to be read

35:53.703 --> 36:01.013
by an officiant before a large congregation and readable without reading boxes.

36:02.255 --> 36:04.377
Well, they can tell you where I am.

36:04.598 --> 36:08.984
I can't read any of them these days.

36:09.464 --> 36:12.448
And these are the covers?

36:12.689 --> 36:15.232
Well, this is the standard binding in leather.

36:16.073 --> 36:22.562
But we also offer full black linen for those who want to spend $750 less.

36:23.335 --> 36:27.261
Most people want the leather.

36:27.621 --> 36:40.119
Now an unusual thing about this Bible is that we set the prose text in full measure and then the metrical portions in double columns.

36:40.139 --> 36:44.405
And it can go back and forth as in Jeremiah.

36:44.725 --> 36:51.435
It's an English mold made paper.

36:53.812 --> 36:54.773
English what, I'm sorry?

36:54.833 --> 36:55.715
Moldmated.

36:55.915 --> 36:56.436
Moldmated.

36:56.496 --> 36:57.457
Yeah.

36:57.477 --> 37:03.165
So here you come along to, in Jeremiah, where it breaks into metrical.

37:04.366 --> 37:05.768
And then you have the two columns.

37:08.472 --> 37:14.260
And this Bible has also the Apocrypha in it.

37:14.280 --> 37:15.521
It's 1,350 pages.

37:16.583 --> 37:16.663
Hmm.

37:17.909 --> 37:20.212
And it's all in one volume?

37:21.113 --> 37:23.656
Oh no, this is just a demonstration.

37:23.676 --> 37:25.278
It's just a demonstration.

37:25.298 --> 37:26.919
But it's in how many volumes is it?

37:26.980 --> 37:32.926
Well, it's in two volumes for most copies, but you can buy it in one.

37:34.969 --> 37:37.672
Regardless for one or two volumes.

37:37.892 --> 37:38.593
And what does it weigh?

37:40.355 --> 37:46.262
It weighs about 50 pounds with the case.

37:46.580 --> 37:49.604
And this is what the books look like in there.

37:49.624 --> 37:50.685
Oh, yeah.

37:50.705 --> 37:52.848
Spectacular.

37:52.868 --> 37:54.130
And what do you call that size?

37:54.871 --> 37:55.271
Folio.

37:55.311 --> 37:56.192
That's a folio.

37:56.212 --> 37:57.434
Isn't that larger than a folio?

37:57.454 --> 37:59.677
Well, it's a large folio.

37:59.697 --> 37:59.797
Yeah.

37:59.817 --> 38:01.339
But not elephants.

38:01.359 --> 38:02.961
Elephant is out of bars.

38:04.984 --> 38:07.527
But that would be the next size beyond this would be an elephant.

38:08.088 --> 38:08.308
Oh.

38:08.869 --> 38:09.109
No?

38:09.670 --> 38:11.212
Well, we'd have to look that up.

38:11.232 --> 38:12.233
No, no, no.

38:15.925 --> 38:19.230
Well, we've done books in all shapes and sizes here can see.

38:19.250 --> 38:22.535
This is John Ashbery's Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror.

38:22.815 --> 38:23.616
That's wonderful.

38:23.696 --> 38:26.901
This is Invisible Cities by Calvino.

38:27.021 --> 38:28.263
That is ingenious.

38:28.283 --> 38:31.328
This is one of the more unusual books we've done here just recently.

38:31.348 --> 38:34.352
That's in steel, aluminum.

38:35.173 --> 38:39.760
So it comes in a case of aluminum with a locking pin.

38:42.043 --> 38:43.165
Isn't that something?

38:46.300 --> 38:47.741
Is there a point to it?

38:49.182 --> 38:50.684
Is there a point to it?

38:50.724 --> 38:53.086
This one is good.

38:53.106 --> 38:55.127
Absolutely.

38:55.348 --> 39:06.217
I like that question because I hope that there is a point or a reason for everything you try to do here.

39:06.237 --> 39:07.598
That's an aluminum binding.

39:07.618 --> 39:09.880
It's a book that has only a back cover.

39:11.121 --> 39:16.105
And the cover that goes over it is like three,

39:16.422 --> 39:18.445
container case with a locking case.

39:18.545 --> 39:19.707
And Andrew invented it all.

39:20.127 --> 39:21.770
I did invent this one.

39:21.850 --> 39:23.372
It was the hardest thing ever.

39:23.432 --> 39:24.774
And the whole thing.

39:24.814 --> 39:25.315
The concept.

39:25.856 --> 39:29.361
But the conceit really has to be the title.

39:29.581 --> 39:32.545
Yeah, you have to check your title.

39:32.986 --> 39:34.488
So, all right.

39:34.508 --> 39:38.454
You look on this page, can you see the word individual?

39:38.474 --> 39:38.794
Yep.

39:38.814 --> 39:40.096
Oh, I didn't see that.

39:40.477 --> 39:41.518
My copy.

39:42.207 --> 39:48.117
You have invisible running down here until it hits the bottom line where it's inked, invisible cities.

39:50.300 --> 39:53.145
How did you get that into the paper?

39:53.265 --> 39:59.215
Well, we printed it without any... It's called blind... What's it called, blind what?

39:59.616 --> 40:01.759
Blind embossing or blind stamping.

40:01.779 --> 40:02.781
Oh, blind stamping.

40:02.801 --> 40:02.961
Yeah.

40:04.003 --> 40:08.991
So then you turn, after the pre-title page, you could consider this

40:10.557 --> 40:12.961
You could consider this the dust jacket.

40:13.041 --> 40:15.024
You could consider this the cover.

40:16.586 --> 40:18.208
You could consider that the pre-title.

40:18.228 --> 40:18.869
That's true.

40:18.949 --> 40:20.532
That's the pre-title.

40:21.333 --> 40:24.638
Then there's this blank page, but it's got somebody's signature on it.

40:26.040 --> 40:32.029
And you turn the lead, and then it looks like it's Wayne Thiebaud signing his own drawing.

40:34.232 --> 40:39.720
But you didn't see that drawing too well because it was on black papers until it came to the page.

40:41.118 --> 41:06.349
We have a conventional title page, a conventional content, an introduction by the translator, and then a number for section one with a hint of color, and you see this blue field on the page.

41:08.152 --> 41:17.007
So you have all these different colored papers hiding the drawings.

41:18.590 --> 41:27.986
So these are all cityscapes by... How do you spell the people's name?

41:28.367 --> 41:32.674
T-H-I-E-B-A-U-T-H-I-E B-A-U-D-Wayne

41:36.518 --> 41:39.662
Can you collaborate with Calvino?

41:39.702 --> 41:41.885
I know Calvino is dead for it.

41:41.905 --> 41:43.968
Calvino has been dead for quite a while.

41:44.148 --> 41:45.510
Ten years or so.

41:45.530 --> 41:47.573
So these are recent, very recent.

41:47.633 --> 41:51.718
Look at that.

41:51.818 --> 41:56.725
So the reason for the binding is that I was having to join all these different elements.

41:57.465 --> 42:05.496
White paper, colored papers, and sheets of clear mylar, plastic.

42:05.847 --> 42:17.985
Not in any predictable order, because they had to fall within the sections.

42:18.687 --> 42:26.218
So, before Timo does the pictures, did you do the print job first and give him the space to work?

42:26.502 --> 42:28.584
You've got to think of formats and stuff.

42:28.604 --> 42:32.508
How are you going to put this?

42:32.548 --> 42:35.271
That's a good question.

42:35.311 --> 42:36.212
We did that.

42:36.232 --> 42:40.676
We set the book and said, this is page one.

42:40.856 --> 42:49.305
So you're basically giving him a hole that he can work in to work within to do a picture, whether it's going to be horizontal or vertical, or it's going to be staggered along the type.

42:49.385 --> 42:53.269
You've already decided that you can have a success.

42:53.468 --> 43:07.381
Well, we also sort of worked, I can't remember exactly how we worked back and forth on this, but obviously I provided him with a narrow measure here so he could do something vertical.

43:08.583 --> 43:19.493
And here, since the image, the text image was so small, we placed it in the middle of the page, and he drew around it.

43:21.008 --> 43:23.871
And how do you reproduce these Mylar sheets?

43:23.891 --> 43:28.736
They're printed by letterpress from photopolymer plates.

43:29.517 --> 43:31.980
And there was the question, would this work?

43:32.400 --> 43:34.082
Was it going to smear?

43:34.603 --> 43:35.604
Would it ever dry?

43:35.944 --> 43:37.045
Was it going to chip off?

43:37.446 --> 43:38.287
Those are good questions.

43:38.987 --> 43:42.611
Well, these are the questions my printers were asking.

43:42.631 --> 43:43.713
They never work.

43:43.753 --> 43:45.234
How did you resolve that?

43:45.274 --> 43:49.699
I said, let's give it a try.

43:50.118 --> 43:51.560
We tested it first, right?

43:51.700 --> 43:53.041
Well, we did test it.

43:53.202 --> 44:00.610
Unfortunately, we had this old proof, fabulous old proof dryer, which was electrically heated with a fan in it.

44:00.630 --> 44:05.596
Many, many drawers, and screen drawers, so that the air would circulate.

44:06.196 --> 44:09.780
We put... Is it a special ink?

44:10.421 --> 44:10.682
No.

44:10.862 --> 44:11.542
Right off the shelf?

44:11.563 --> 44:12.744
Just off the shelf.

44:12.764 --> 44:19.872
So the last illustration is shown on the aluminum or on the paper.

44:21.235 --> 44:26.241
And this image is also done as an action.

44:26.261 --> 44:30.947
And again, to go back to my question of the point of that painting.

44:31.048 --> 44:35.834
Well, the hardest thing I had to do was to figure out how to find this book.

44:35.854 --> 44:38.597
And I hadn't solved the problem when we went to press.

44:38.677 --> 44:49.251
So we went to the trouble of printing this book so that it could be bound in a conventional manner, but with tip-ins, so that the colored papers would have been tipped into the book

44:50.530 --> 45:00.024
And the mylar would have had to have been hand-sanded on one area just in order to get it to stick to paper.

45:00.264 --> 45:04.089
It would have been enormously time-consuming.

45:04.109 --> 45:09.357
And then I was on an airplane, and I knew it had to be a ring-binding sort of book.

45:09.457 --> 45:11.620
Ring-bindings bind up to paper.

45:11.660 --> 45:16.487
You remember your old school notebook where the pages, you know,

45:16.822 --> 45:18.324
holes were always tearing out.

45:18.364 --> 45:22.150
Well, that's because that's how a conventional ring binder works.

45:22.610 --> 45:29.420
But with a hoop binding and with only a back cover, you don't have that problem.

45:30.001 --> 45:37.091
So what popped into my head was, of course, it's the calendar.

45:38.713 --> 45:41.918
Turn the pages of your calendar.

45:43.349 --> 45:47.016
99.99.

45:47.256 --> 45:52.546
We did 400.

45:52.646 --> 46:01.562
But only a few of them came with an extra print.

46:01.822 --> 46:02.303
Right.

46:02.323 --> 46:02.684
100?

46:02.704 --> 46:07.072
40 or 50?

46:07.092 --> 46:07.212
40.

46:07.232 --> 46:07.753
That's great.

46:08.982 --> 46:18.184
So let's go on to the gallery.

46:18.204 --> 46:27.345
That's Robert Motherwell, James Porter, Joyce's Ulysses.

46:28.270 --> 46:34.097
These are woodblock bricks by Martin Currier or Kane by Jean Toomer.

46:34.237 --> 46:36.660
There's the etching by... That's what we're just looking at in there.

46:36.680 --> 46:38.262
Oh, and this is our gallery.

46:39.643 --> 46:40.124
Yeah.

46:42.267 --> 46:44.970
Our edition of Moby Dick, which was hand-set.

46:46.151 --> 46:47.092
Which is very old.

46:47.673 --> 46:49.015
Yeah.

46:49.055 --> 46:50.857
Very, very nice.

46:50.877 --> 46:52.118
Ape and Cat.

46:52.539 --> 46:55.002
This is one of our artist books with Jim Dine.

46:55.022 --> 46:56.944
That's a wonderful...

46:58.578 --> 47:04.125
And these are prints for the next publication.

47:07.389 --> 47:13.256
See, we often publish prints in conjunction with the publication.

47:13.356 --> 47:13.897
Makes sense.

47:15.579 --> 47:15.679
Sure.

47:15.699 --> 47:20.305
This is the cane that I was showing you.

47:20.365 --> 47:24.049
He made that box for the book as a sculptor.

47:24.249 --> 47:27.133
That's wonderful.

47:27.991 --> 47:39.805
Now, at this end of the room, we have a little piece of complication, which is Tom Stockard's play, Arcadia.

47:41.027 --> 47:43.770
And it is unusual for two reasons.

47:43.790 --> 47:48.796
The prints fold out from under the front and back cover.

47:48.836 --> 47:51.500
So you can look at all four illustrations at once.

47:52.301 --> 47:55.905
There are also continuous tone prints.

47:56.206 --> 48:00.955
printed by an iris printing process.

48:01.556 --> 48:17.387
So they're continuous tone prints, and you see the large print versions of them here, showing the landscape of Arcadia as it changes from 1735 to the present.

48:17.958 --> 48:20.482
scenes that the audience never gets to.

48:20.502 --> 48:22.445
And it's at the same location.

48:22.705 --> 48:25.289
Same location, but in regards to changes.

48:25.309 --> 48:27.833
1735, 1809, 1812, and the present.

48:27.953 --> 48:31.037
Again, your invention.

48:31.698 --> 48:34.162
Yeah.

48:34.182 --> 48:40.151
With an introduction by Diana, a scholarly introduction about the history of E. Wood's garden.

48:40.291 --> 48:44.617
These are the framed large prints.

48:45.579 --> 48:46.480
There's a prince.

48:46.595 --> 48:51.006
So those aren't the original art.

48:51.227 --> 48:56.541
But they look so close to the watercolor.

48:56.561 --> 48:59.489
Well, they look like white.

48:59.749 --> 49:02.376
There's a white hat back there.

49:03.301 --> 49:09.370
So we have Arcadia indoors and Arcadia outside.

49:13.737 --> 49:18.564
You were so intrigued by how the text and the image could be integrated.

49:18.744 --> 49:29.140
And this is certainly one of the characteristics of what Andrew does, not just prints inserted into a conventionally bound book.

49:29.660 --> 49:37.415
Again, you set the text first.

49:37.775 --> 49:43.767
Did you send me some materials you were going to give me?

49:44.228 --> 49:45.390
Yes.

49:45.843 --> 49:51.592
You can send it to me if you want to.

49:52.133 --> 49:55.678
Do you have the patience to watch a seven-minute video?

49:55.698 --> 49:55.999
You know what?

49:56.039 --> 49:58.282
I haven't even talked to you.

49:58.482 --> 50:01.227
Oh, no, I mean, I wanted to give it to you.

50:01.247 --> 50:01.767
Oh, okay.

50:01.787 --> 50:04.271
It was done on the Jim Lehrer News Hour.

50:04.371 --> 50:05.433
Oh, I'd love to have that.

50:05.453 --> 50:07.035
Yeah, that would be great.

50:07.056 --> 50:08.438
Seven minutes is very good.

50:08.458 --> 50:11.823
Yeah, excuse me.

50:11.903 --> 50:13.626
Is it William T. William?

50:13.646 --> 50:14.567
William T. William?

50:15.138 --> 50:15.659
Wiley.

50:15.799 --> 50:18.302
Wiley, of course, yeah.

50:18.363 --> 50:24.211
So these are unique works, and here is the print that we published in conjunction with the book.

50:25.633 --> 50:29.038
I cut it up into six parts to bind it into the book.

50:29.138 --> 50:31.521
So you see, here's how it fits into the model.

50:33.163 --> 50:34.265
I'm looking at it upside down.

50:34.325 --> 50:35.286
Yeah.

50:37.089 --> 50:38.711
Oh, sure.

50:38.751 --> 50:39.612
It's a streetscape.

50:39.813 --> 50:40.774
Very nice.

50:45.277 --> 50:46.058
Very nice.

50:46.519 --> 50:47.361
Congratulations.

50:47.661 --> 50:48.603
Thanks.

50:48.843 --> 50:49.845
Glad to have you come.

50:50.206 --> 50:57.378
Sorry we weren't able to do it before the logistics of getting out here while I was closing the book.

50:57.398 --> 51:01.846
Well, in a way, I'm so happy you were able to see us in our new location.

51:01.886 --> 51:04.050
Yeah, well, I'd like to have seen the old one, too.

51:05.412 --> 51:08.918
But I'm writing a lot of, I continue to work.

51:09.018 --> 51:09.900
Sure.

51:10.370 --> 51:12.074
That's great.

51:12.094 --> 51:13.477
Thanks a lot.

51:13.497 --> 51:16.524
Is that what you're talking about in a book?

51:16.544 --> 51:17.065
Well, kind of.

51:17.085 --> 51:19.631
We'll see what I talk about when we get up there.

51:20.674 --> 51:24.062
Yeah, I'm talking about my continuing work in this book.

51:24.122 --> 51:26.327
Thanks a lot for everything.

51:26.587 --> 51:27.630
We'll see you tonight.

51:27.650 --> 51:28.632
In a couple hours.
