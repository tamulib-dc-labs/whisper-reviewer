00:04.435 --> 00:06.518
John Lawrence.

00:06.918 --> 00:11.945
I'm planning an exhibition called By the Hand of a Woman.

00:13.067 --> 00:24.362
It thrives in illuminations and the provenance are manuscripts delicious by women for women.

00:24.382 --> 00:27.827
Clear provenance, no leaving.

00:28.769 --> 00:31.534
This came out as a result of a lecture at Indiana.

00:32.455 --> 00:40.169
And I had a group of very scholarly library science people that probably earned their masters in the 70s.

00:40.990 --> 00:45.358
Very prim, proper, the old guard library people.

00:45.378 --> 00:50.787
I mean, very civilized, intellectual, lovely movie.

00:51.468 --> 00:52.009
Pardon me?

00:52.208 --> 00:56.133
I wrote their names down, and I'm giving this call.

00:56.434 --> 00:58.717
Yeah, that time.

00:58.837 --> 01:05.085
And I mentioned, I held up this manuscript, it's a Carmelite manuscript, and I made an off remark.

01:05.105 --> 01:08.750
Now these are very prim and proper, ladies, okay?

01:08.770 --> 01:10.712
I'm very chink to you.

01:10.732 --> 01:18.182
And say, I think it would be really nice if someone would do an exhibition of works by women for women.

01:18.162 --> 01:22.246
And they turned in, as Rush Limbaugh would call Feminots, and said, where's it at?

01:22.446 --> 01:23.848
I go, whoa, get an idea.

01:23.908 --> 01:26.991
So they jumped me after the lecture and said, are you going to do that?

01:27.091 --> 01:27.752
Are you going to do that?

01:27.792 --> 01:29.293
I said, I don't know if I can do it.

01:29.374 --> 01:33.838
I said, works by women are very rare in this period.

01:33.858 --> 01:42.527
The best I will do, if you will take charge of logistics, and as this is the planning stage, I said, I will see what I can do.

01:42.667 --> 01:47.292
So I went to all the top book dealers in the world, and I said, I'd like works by women.

01:48.622 --> 01:50.544
And they go, why?

01:51.345 --> 01:54.389
OK, I'm going to do an exhibition by women.

01:54.489 --> 01:56.691
I go, why?

01:57.813 --> 02:00.456
So I hold up the almighty dollar a pound, as it may be.

02:00.516 --> 02:02.858
Now, that shark smells of blood.

02:02.878 --> 02:05.401
But then they start, look, they have nothing.

02:05.622 --> 02:07.304
So I have them scouring around.

02:07.424 --> 02:12.189
And I find pieces and institutional questions.

02:12.489 --> 02:15.533
I go home and do an inventory what I have.

02:16.494 --> 02:17.295
Bucks it off.

02:18.338 --> 02:24.858
One guy comes back and says, as far as I know, you have the largest collection of what's by women in a private collection.

02:24.878 --> 02:27.285
Certainly east of the Mississippi.

02:27.704 --> 02:29.988
And I said, pardon me, did you say works?

02:30.008 --> 02:30.869
Are you talking about manuscripts?

02:30.889 --> 02:34.155
I'm talking about illuminations and manuscripts, scribings.

02:34.175 --> 02:35.678
But are these strictly by women?

02:35.698 --> 02:37.942
These are very rarely signed.

02:38.062 --> 02:49.101
Well, you get that by, this is where the book breaking comes in, where they have the original book, which is clearly identified as to monastery.

02:49.722 --> 02:53.408
In the case of the antiphonal of Marguerite de Bocqueville, she signed it.

02:53.388 --> 02:56.372
Three times she signed it in an initial.

02:56.392 --> 03:02.901
I mean, it was a very arrogant act for a Renaissance woman to do, and I'm being facetious here.

03:03.141 --> 03:08.969
So I'd been involved with Marguerite Bacovall's Antipano when it was intact.

03:09.249 --> 03:13.515
It was purchased at Christie's, I think, for $25,000.

03:14.316 --> 03:16.839
I'm not clear on that.

03:16.859 --> 03:20.644
And I was there with a book breaker who showed it to me.

03:21.704 --> 03:25.249
And that was magnificent, the whole book.

03:25.269 --> 03:26.671
And it was a magnificent book.

03:26.771 --> 03:28.514
And I said, you can't, Tim.

03:29.475 --> 03:32.019
I said, how much do you want for the book?

03:32.159 --> 03:33.981
Unbroken.

03:34.001 --> 03:36.705
He said, pay $25,000 for it.

03:36.805 --> 03:39.169
I want $45,000 for it.

03:39.269 --> 03:40.551
I said, OK.

03:41.011 --> 03:41.833
I go home.

03:41.853 --> 03:45.518
My wife, here we go with the home equity loan.

03:45.538 --> 03:47.701
Get $45,000 certified check.

03:50.565 --> 03:51.306
Turn around.

03:51.809 --> 03:56.998
Right back to his full gallery, 45,000, where's the book?

03:57.018 --> 03:59.803
He said, you're not going to get it.

03:59.863 --> 04:03.650
He said, I want 100,000 for now.

04:03.730 --> 04:05.874
I said, what are you going to do with it?

04:05.894 --> 04:07.297
I knew he was going to do it.

04:07.317 --> 04:09.220
He's going to break it.

04:09.240 --> 04:12.766
He opens up, there's seven miniatures in it.

04:12.786 --> 04:15.471
He said, these miniatures will retail as a minimum.

04:15.620 --> 04:18.485
8,000, 9,000 articles.

04:18.505 --> 04:19.927
Is he an American bookseller?

04:19.947 --> 04:20.888
Yeah, American bookseller.

04:20.908 --> 04:21.549
Do we know who it is?

04:21.569 --> 04:22.451
Oh, I know who it is.

04:22.471 --> 04:24.114
I'll talk to you about that privately.

04:24.134 --> 04:25.696
I mean, do I know who it is?

04:25.716 --> 04:27.299
Yeah, you know his name when I drop it.

04:27.319 --> 04:28.160
We all know.

04:28.180 --> 04:30.544
Yeah, it's kind of a nefarious name.

04:30.564 --> 04:34.450
And I think quite a lot of you all know that the business is doing this.

04:34.570 --> 04:36.854
Yeah, well, not publicly.

04:37.154 --> 04:41.982
I mean, when you put a mouse in a box with a hungry cat, what do you think is going to happen?

04:44.611 --> 04:47.475
He then says, look at these initials.

04:47.495 --> 04:53.965
Marguerite de Bocavel had hired Louis Bacard, a Renaissance artist, to do the miniatures.

04:54.005 --> 04:57.289
She directed the themes, and she directed the initials.

04:57.410 --> 05:08.145
Then she did over 300 sketches, illuminations herself of various themes, including what looks like a portrait of her sister, Patton Hoban.

05:09.467 --> 05:11.530
She had the audacity to sign the book,

05:12.792 --> 05:17.579
She was a Carthusian nut, and this is completely opposite.

05:17.739 --> 05:22.906
So I told him, I said, you can't break this book.

05:22.946 --> 05:26.270
He said, this book is worth a million dollars, book.

05:26.351 --> 05:27.973
He said, you know how this works.

05:27.993 --> 05:29.014
And I said, that's the problem.

05:29.395 --> 05:31.818
I said, I'm warning you, don't do this.

05:32.219 --> 05:33.961
He went from $45,000 to a million, right?

05:34.161 --> 05:35.123
Pardon me?

05:35.303 --> 05:39.248
He went from $45,000 to a million in a matter of hours, basically.

05:39.288 --> 05:39.569
He thought.

05:40.149 --> 05:41.331
He thought he did.

05:41.615 --> 05:44.177
Yeah, and that's the way this works.

05:44.998 --> 05:48.121
So this is the same guy who wanted to break a Tyndale Bible, by the way.

05:48.622 --> 05:51.444
Is this Graham we're talking about?

05:51.565 --> 05:52.846
Pardon me?

05:52.866 --> 05:54.588
Is this Graham the Raider?

05:54.608 --> 05:55.168
No.

05:55.248 --> 05:55.749
No.

05:55.769 --> 05:55.829
No.

05:55.849 --> 05:57.650
He's got his own little area.

05:57.831 --> 06:00.453
So we know who we're not talking about.

06:00.473 --> 06:06.519
So I said to him, I want to buy as many of the miniatures as I can.

06:06.639 --> 06:08.601
Well, he wants the national deficits.

06:09.442 --> 06:13.467
And he doesn't want to give them to me because he knows that I'm going to use them.

06:13.487 --> 06:17.232
They're not going to disappear to some obscure private collection.

06:17.252 --> 06:20.576
So he sells them off to other manuscript dealers.

06:20.596 --> 06:21.417
So he did great for that.

06:21.437 --> 06:22.758
Oh, broke it apart.

06:22.778 --> 06:24.481
Cut it apart.

06:24.501 --> 06:26.002
That's horrible.

06:26.022 --> 06:31.649
Well, these guys are always desperate for cash in one way or another.

06:31.669 --> 06:35.474
They'll make a fortune on one book and go out and do something stupid or another.

06:37.356 --> 06:38.638
Times get hard.

06:39.142 --> 06:46.011
I go to one of the manuscript dealers who has the main miniature.

06:46.031 --> 06:49.535
It's a white woman of Jerusalem.

06:49.555 --> 06:54.001
Very feministy, disguised as the ascension.

06:54.021 --> 06:56.644
It is even the text.

06:56.664 --> 06:58.527
Rise up, ye daughters of Jerusalem.

06:59.027 --> 07:00.970
Very feministy.

07:01.150 --> 07:02.992
So times are hard.

07:03.012 --> 07:08.980
I get this miniature for like $6,000, which is really a bargain.

07:09.365 --> 07:14.551
He lets go of a number of the smaller miniatures, or the smaller leaves.

07:14.571 --> 07:17.655
I'd already collected as many of her individual leaves as I could find.

07:18.256 --> 07:22.461
They were selling, plain leaves were selling for $400 a cup.

07:22.481 --> 07:25.144
Ones with initials, beautiful initials, were $600.

07:25.224 --> 07:26.566
Multiple initials, $1,200.

07:26.586 --> 07:27.647
You can do the math.

07:27.867 --> 07:31.772
You know, you have 100-some leaves, you know, this number.

07:31.792 --> 07:36.958
So I find the other book dealer has two of her signatures.

07:37.799 --> 07:43.189
He needs money quick, so he sells them to me for like 900 hours each.

07:43.690 --> 07:44.772
Is this the same guy?

07:44.792 --> 07:45.814
No, different guy.

07:45.974 --> 07:52.126
The book breaker has subcontracted his whole sale piece out to people.

07:52.146 --> 07:53.509
So I buy both of those.

07:53.529 --> 07:57.917
Then he finds out I'm really interested in this, and he says, by the way, I've got one that's dated.

07:57.897 --> 08:21.627
in the initial 1539 how much do you want because i want 900 i said okay that's fine i buy it for you five friends and by the way i get five of your carmelite leaves on a assignment as i threw those in with the deal i think this is what you deal with these guys i mean you know it's like sharks nipping at each other if you don't nip back they're not going to respect you so

08:22.636 --> 08:27.084
I have to keep this business of this women's exhibition quiet because I know what it's going to do.

08:27.144 --> 08:28.827
It's going to force the price at least through the roof.

08:28.867 --> 08:35.058
So I go out and acquire all the Carmelite, which was a large antiphonal, the Carmelite Order.

08:35.078 --> 08:39.305
It was scribed on paper, beautiful hand-leaf paper, illuminated.

08:39.325 --> 08:41.870
One of the illuminations looks like a quilt.

08:42.891 --> 08:45.015
And in the middle of the book,

08:45.485 --> 09:03.882
which is very rare, are two large leaves and a very good yet very derivative form of lack of instructions by a woman to a woman on how to notate and rubricate music.

09:04.081 --> 09:08.107
First of all, it's in the middle of a book, which is rare for that to happen, accepted by the women.

09:08.127 --> 09:10.831
I said, what do you want for those?

09:10.851 --> 09:12.794
And he says, 150 each.

09:12.874 --> 09:15.598
I said, I've got to be honest with you.

09:16.159 --> 09:18.743
Do you know what those are?

09:18.763 --> 09:20.125
No, they're from the Carmelite.

09:20.145 --> 09:22.569
This one guy can read a little bit of Latin.

09:22.589 --> 09:25.093
Most of them can't read any Latin.

09:25.113 --> 09:26.595
I said, do you know what the temple is?

09:26.930 --> 09:28.832
You know what it says?

09:28.852 --> 09:32.936
He said, no, I don't know the first word, which is a derivative to give advice.

09:32.956 --> 09:34.298
I said, it's instructions.

09:34.618 --> 09:36.640
I said, I'll buy both of them.

09:36.700 --> 09:40.804
I'll buy every piece of Carmelite you have, because that book was intact.

09:41.145 --> 09:47.311
So what we're doing in the exhibition is only including leaves and have a 100% clear provenance.

09:47.331 --> 09:52.276
And Jim Merrill from Princeton authenticated a miniature I had, which was done by the four players.

09:53.177 --> 09:54.799
Very beautiful miniature.

09:54.819 --> 09:55.840
Next thing I know,

09:55.938 --> 10:02.585
I hear from the McMaster University people in Hamilton, and they're doing, they have a website of Medieval Women.

10:02.605 --> 10:04.207
They have a television series.

10:04.227 --> 10:05.889
I said, do you want to collaborate with us?

10:05.949 --> 10:07.491
Well, what do we need to do?

10:07.551 --> 10:10.674
I said, I want you to do, this is going to be an educational exhibition.

10:10.694 --> 10:12.616
I want you to do the brochures.

10:12.636 --> 10:14.438
I want you to do the extraneous material.

10:14.458 --> 10:17.141
It's not just an art exhibition.

10:17.201 --> 10:24.389
It's a writing, painting, history of the women, motivation of women exhibition.

10:24.429 --> 10:25.270
She said...

10:25.503 --> 10:28.566
We negotiate.

10:28.586 --> 10:38.617
Let me ask you, do you know the name Jeffrey Hamburger, who's now at Harvard, and kind of specializes in women with medieval manuscripts?

10:38.938 --> 10:39.759
I've never met him.

10:39.839 --> 10:40.459
I know the name.

10:40.620 --> 10:42.962
He used to teach at Obama.

10:42.982 --> 10:44.304
He was in Eric's position.

10:45.465 --> 10:47.027
If you could connect me.

10:47.447 --> 10:48.388
I've heard the name.

10:48.622 --> 10:53.449
I could do that.

10:53.609 --> 11:04.485
I'm sure Eric Engels teaches Medieval in our Art History department on Jeffrey Hamburger.

11:04.786 --> 11:09.212
As I understand it from Eric, this was really his specialty, because I mentioned to Eric

11:09.614 --> 11:14.405
that you were working on this medieval manuscript by women.

11:14.665 --> 11:19.276
And then he said, oh, that's Jeffrey's thing.

11:19.296 --> 11:25.530
Well, what he could do is help me locate pieces in collections that people may want to loan out.

11:25.510 --> 11:33.820
There's the, well, the book you're going to have, The Dominican Reverie, that was all done by women, five different women, from cover to cover.

11:34.040 --> 11:36.383
And that was very close to being broken.

11:36.403 --> 11:38.285
I think I told you that before I inquired that.

11:38.425 --> 11:39.066
I'm the same guy.

11:39.727 --> 11:41.889
Where is the exhibition going to be?

11:41.909 --> 11:51.180
What's going to open at the Shelley Museum in Harmony, Indiana, it's going to go to McMaster in Canada, and then after that, I'm keeping it open to find out what Oberlin wants to do.

11:51.160 --> 11:52.863
It's not going to go to Northern Ohio.

11:52.943 --> 11:55.348
It's going to go to the East Coast.

11:55.408 --> 11:56.750
And I'm falling out of it.

11:56.770 --> 11:58.453
I'm letting the women scholars take over.

11:59.195 --> 12:00.016
They are really great.

12:00.116 --> 12:00.958
They're rabid.

12:01.399 --> 12:02.461
They really love this.

12:03.042 --> 12:03.803
They're on a mission.

12:04.144 --> 12:05.867
And I'm completely off of it.

12:05.887 --> 12:07.209
I'm putting the pieces together.

12:07.289 --> 12:09.253
I'm doing the legwork with the book dealers.

12:09.233 --> 12:11.556
and letting them do the scholarship.

12:11.576 --> 12:16.423
You know, it's not going to be the most impressive thing, you see, but it's very unusual now.

12:16.543 --> 12:19.147
Well, it's a start.

12:21.110 --> 12:26.737
I talked to Sandra Hindman, who is one of the top five now.

12:26.757 --> 12:30.923
I said, Sandra, and she's the chair of the Art History Department of Northwestern.

12:30.983 --> 12:33.186
She's also a manuscript.

12:33.207 --> 12:34.949
I said, do you have any work by women?

12:34.969 --> 12:35.730
She said, no.

12:35.812 --> 12:39.538
Seconds of 19th century illuminations by women.

12:39.558 --> 12:40.599
So why not?

12:41.721 --> 12:44.606
So we're going from New Harmony, Indiana.

12:45.226 --> 12:47.410
I'd say we're going to be here a while.

12:47.430 --> 12:54.681
In New Harmony, Indiana, they're going to bring in Jane Owen, Jane Owen,

12:54.847 --> 13:07.506
very rare

13:07.942 --> 13:13.249
Early American fracture done by the harmonists.

13:13.289 --> 13:18.235
Jane Owen, who was behind us in New Harmony, never approached her.

13:18.275 --> 13:21.900
New Harmony was the place I went for years.

13:21.920 --> 13:25.264
I always wanted to meet her, and one of the scholars approached her, and she's really great on that.

13:25.284 --> 13:31.772
She said, well, I'm going to contact the historic New Harmony, and contact the people at the Pennsylvania.

13:32.073 --> 13:35.965
And so we do loan us your fracture, which is quite, you know, no one just does that.

13:35.985 --> 13:38.172
So we'll loan it for this exhibition.

13:38.192 --> 13:46.437
And whether they allow it to follow the exhibitions in their story, but they sent it to, they said, yeah, it'll be there in New Harmony.

13:46.720 --> 13:55.070
And so we're putting together something that's 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th century.

13:55.150 --> 14:01.838
And then I'm going to have one of the people look at some 20th century Illuminates that are women.

14:01.858 --> 14:07.865
So the whole idea is to put together, but where I'm coming around the circle to tell Nick is, I'm going to tell the story.

14:08.285 --> 14:15.934
They want to know about the Backevel thing, which has been tremendously painful to me, about who broke this book.

14:15.914 --> 14:21.664
I mean, no one's ever asked me, Nick, no one ever asked me, who writes these books?

14:21.724 --> 14:23.568
I mean, I give lectures, I'm getting this lately.

14:23.608 --> 14:25.111
Who wrote this book?

14:25.351 --> 14:26.713
Your old book.

14:26.854 --> 14:29.559
I can't mention its name, but you can until my attorney clears it.

14:29.579 --> 14:31.081
You know it.

14:31.101 --> 14:32.364
You've attended anything?

14:32.644 --> 14:33.826
Yeah, yeah.

14:33.846 --> 14:34.868
Who lives in this area?

14:35.084 --> 14:36.667
He lives in Northern, Ohio.

14:36.788 --> 14:38.592
In the Akron area?

14:38.993 --> 14:39.173
Mm-hmm.

14:39.193 --> 14:39.714
He's a bookseller.

14:40.315 --> 14:42.941
His first name wouldn't be Bruce, would it?

14:43.843 --> 14:44.805
Nancy James.

14:44.825 --> 14:46.329
Oh, thank God.

14:46.349 --> 14:46.649
That's amazing.

14:46.669 --> 14:49.656
Are you talking about Bruce Berrini?

14:49.696 --> 14:52.502
Did I say that name?

14:53.579 --> 14:55.983
You'll find a lot of information real quick.

14:56.003 --> 14:58.407
I thought you had a closer association.

14:58.487 --> 15:01.232
You have no close association with these people.

15:02.013 --> 15:07.743
You have no close association with these people.

15:07.983 --> 15:13.072
You have a symbionic relationship with all of these people, as Nick will tell you.

15:13.092 --> 15:14.895
If you want access to the material,

15:16.040 --> 15:40.461
you have to be very pragmatic and therefore you know these people could shut me down in a moment i mean it's a closed group and it comes to medieval books renaissance books of five people in the world and they're all interconnected and at a moment they can shut shut me down i mean they could they could do it in a moment and i don't think it'll happen

15:40.947 --> 15:43.672
Because I'm doing a lot of exhibitions and lectures.

15:43.692 --> 15:45.175
I would shut you down in what respect?

15:45.195 --> 15:48.882
Well, if they decided I was a threat to their business, they would shut me down.

15:48.902 --> 15:55.615
If you chose book breaking, if you kind of attack them on the issue of book breaking... Well, I've already gotten one phone call after I did a speech in Philadelphia.

15:55.797 --> 16:02.767
You know what you need, Don?

16:02.807 --> 16:09.377
You need somebody who is not dependent on you.

16:10.299 --> 16:12.302
Well, you know, that's the problem.

16:12.682 --> 16:13.944
Well, I do it, you know.

16:13.964 --> 16:16.268
I name names.

16:16.568 --> 16:18.531
Well, I understand that.

16:18.511 --> 16:25.882
I understand you do, but we'll have to talk about that, and we'll have to back it up.

16:25.902 --> 16:29.367
You have to be very careful about what you're saying.

16:29.447 --> 16:34.975
I have to be very careful, but accept the fact that I've been around this so long, I don't even know where they're footnotes in journals.

16:35.035 --> 16:38.741
I understand that I'm very careful with what I do, too.

16:38.841 --> 16:44.569
I'm the guy who writes the books, and if there are any lawsuits, they're into me.

16:44.549 --> 16:51.337
Minor old guard manuscript dealers who absolutely hate some of the big names.

16:51.798 --> 16:52.779
You have two groups in it.

16:52.799 --> 16:56.624
You have this group that's extremely ethical, which has died out.

16:57.304 --> 16:59.227
The whole dog?

16:59.507 --> 17:02.150
And actually, their prices on the leaves are realistic.

17:02.210 --> 17:06.696
And then you have the group that came in in the 80s and the 90s that built their business.

17:06.716 --> 17:08.618
The top five now are Farini.

17:09.319 --> 17:11.822
Well, I would say the top five are Farini,

17:12.477 --> 17:13.739
Sam Fogg in London.

17:14.140 --> 17:14.640
Sam Fogg?

17:14.841 --> 17:15.482
Sam Fogg.

17:15.762 --> 17:16.643
F-O-G-G.

17:17.405 --> 17:20.449
That's where this shipment was coming from today.

17:20.529 --> 17:23.474
Now, we're not talking about breakers.

17:23.514 --> 17:24.576
We're talking about dealers.

17:24.636 --> 17:31.486
But, you know, the question you always have to ask, Nick, is where's the line between and how did they get there?

17:31.667 --> 17:37.135
You're talking Jorn Gunther in Germany.

17:37.317 --> 17:39.561
Yes, yes, I have.

17:39.681 --> 17:43.809
He has to be one of the leading guys, wouldn't you think?

17:43.869 --> 17:45.191
I write about him in this new book.

17:45.412 --> 17:52.685
I don't know how leading he is.

17:54.829 --> 17:57.333
His name has never hit my radar.

17:57.493 --> 17:58.195
Read the chapter.

17:58.255 --> 17:59.477
I mean, I write about him in the new book.

17:59.744 --> 18:01.487
I will, but his name has never hit.

18:01.547 --> 18:03.751
He really doesn't sell that much in the States.

18:03.771 --> 18:04.672
That's why he doesn't.

18:04.732 --> 18:07.056
He says he has 35 customers in the world.

18:07.357 --> 18:09.981
Well, then that's probably why I've heard him.

18:10.001 --> 18:10.943
This was who again?

18:10.963 --> 18:11.844
Tenture.

18:11.864 --> 18:13.948
Yeah, but I've heard the name.

18:14.289 --> 18:18.035
Yeah, who started out in Bavaria, and he's now in Switzerland.

18:18.055 --> 18:20.159
What I'll do is I'll take a look at that.

18:20.179 --> 18:21.060
Run his name.

18:21.040 --> 18:23.503
He's got a website.

18:23.583 --> 18:25.806
Take a look at his website.

18:26.067 --> 18:30.613
Read what I have to write about him in the book.

18:31.134 --> 18:38.363
John, it sounded like from the description of that that he was selling complete medieval manuscript.

18:38.423 --> 18:41.367
He was not breaking that at all.

18:41.848 --> 18:44.091
Totally high-end.

18:44.111 --> 18:45.012
Absolutely.

18:45.513 --> 18:48.617
He looks for things that are really special.

18:49.154 --> 18:53.360
And as Dick was describing it, he kind of falls in love with these things.

18:53.421 --> 18:58.629
And then he goes out to his small group of people and convinces them to fall in love with it.

18:58.649 --> 19:00.091
And then they'll pay the big money.

19:00.131 --> 19:01.353
So he's a salesperson.

19:01.413 --> 19:02.494
Extraordinary.

19:02.514 --> 19:03.135
Catalog.

19:03.155 --> 19:03.696
Catalog.

19:03.776 --> 19:06.781
He's got a website.

19:07.041 --> 19:10.206
Go take a look at his website.

19:10.487 --> 19:12.229
Just do a search, Google search.

19:12.269 --> 19:17.878
I'm going to run his name to two of these people to see if they bought things from him.

19:17.858 --> 19:36.643
or if he refused to sell for them two of which people two of the two of the big five i started to name oh just drop his name and see did you ever get anything from him i don't think he sells it i don't think he has this yeah well i want to find out

19:36.623 --> 19:40.267
He's got 30 people who are enormously wealthy and who collect.

19:40.287 --> 19:41.968
And that's what he does.

19:42.289 --> 19:46.233
You know, I mean, like Conrad Black.

19:46.253 --> 19:50.577
What does Conrad Black know about him?

19:50.637 --> 19:51.218
Nothing.

19:51.238 --> 19:54.901
No, he doesn't like the appearances.

19:55.022 --> 19:56.503
Yeah, but I mean, the guy's got the money.

19:56.523 --> 20:00.587
What do any of these guys know about a precious art in the 80s and early 90s?

20:00.607 --> 20:01.348
I mean,

20:01.328 --> 20:03.572
Here's my $40 million impression of art.

20:03.592 --> 20:05.015
Here's my $40 million Monet.

20:05.295 --> 20:05.977
Isn't it beautiful?

20:05.997 --> 20:07.840
Here's my $40 million Monet.

20:07.880 --> 20:09.383
That's what's happening with medieval books.

20:09.403 --> 20:15.054
Here's my 14th century... I'm writing about this in that chapter I was talking about in this book.

20:15.074 --> 20:17.939
John Wendell says... Is this your new book?

20:17.959 --> 20:19.242
Yeah, the big book.

20:19.302 --> 20:20.364
The little one.

20:20.424 --> 20:21.205
The little one.

20:21.566 --> 20:23.269
I don't know if I really...

20:24.953 --> 20:29.525
I don't care who they are.

20:29.625 --> 20:34.297
And I don't want the Christie's to suffer these.

20:34.317 --> 20:37.364
Because frankly, you know, they're just options.

20:37.565 --> 20:39.570
I mean, that's where the book breakers go.

20:39.888 --> 20:41.730
Talk a bit about the book breakers.

20:41.750 --> 20:44.452
I mean, is this something that's new?

20:44.512 --> 20:45.013
It's not new.

20:45.053 --> 20:46.714
It goes back to the 20th century.

20:46.834 --> 20:52.039
I didn't think we were doing it anymore, so we're doing it again.

20:52.059 --> 20:53.320
That's what's been unique about it.

20:53.340 --> 20:56.083
I mean, doing it, it was feeding time in the 80s and 90s.

20:56.663 --> 21:00.046
I mean, books of ours, Boston University had a big sale.

21:00.146 --> 21:07.953
I gave a talk which was very controversial on what I called institutionalized co-conspirators and book breakers.

21:08.354 --> 21:09.895
And I really stepped on a nerve

21:10.600 --> 21:14.071
And I had my facts straight, so they were in a hard position.

21:14.853 --> 21:20.672
I traced several books, including the Hildensei book, which you've seen.

21:20.692 --> 21:21.775
And I got all the data on it.

21:22.565 --> 21:27.233
And all the ex officio collection went through the institution to talk.

21:28.254 --> 21:35.105
Boston University did, in the late 80s, a massive sale from their Institute for Bibles.

21:35.125 --> 21:37.569
Now, this isn't Howard Gottlieb who's doing this.

21:37.590 --> 21:40.294
He's the one that's head of the special collections.

21:40.374 --> 21:40.554
No.

21:40.655 --> 21:40.935
Oh, no.

21:41.155 --> 21:42.818
No, there was an Institute.

21:43.338 --> 21:44.921
for biblical research or something.

21:44.961 --> 21:46.483
Biblical?

21:46.663 --> 21:47.104
Yeah.

21:47.124 --> 21:48.326
And I'll have to get you the details.

21:48.386 --> 21:49.508
I know it's a quick story.

21:49.528 --> 21:50.389
I mean the exact title.

21:50.449 --> 21:51.611
And they had a catalog.

21:51.731 --> 21:54.396
I don't go with anything without the documentation.

21:54.416 --> 21:55.738
Well, no, no, but I would.

21:55.758 --> 21:57.060
I'm just giving you a new story.

21:57.120 --> 22:03.330
And they had a massive catalog of books of ours, religious books they sold.

22:04.391 --> 22:06.475
And the book breakers were there.

22:07.496 --> 22:08.518
And they got involved in this.

22:09.241 --> 22:10.543
And they bought these books.

22:10.563 --> 22:13.528
And I don't know how many of these books of ours that they have.

22:14.209 --> 22:14.529
Yeah.

22:14.750 --> 22:17.714
Boston University did in their seat.

22:17.774 --> 22:20.118
Well, here's what happened in the lecture.

22:20.138 --> 22:21.380
One guy challenged me.

22:21.420 --> 22:29.132
And he said, I want to go on record in saying that every of the institutions here, we hope that it is our time.

22:29.152 --> 22:30.334
But I said, cut the crap.

22:31.736 --> 22:33.639
You know who buys these books.

22:33.739 --> 22:35.502
If you put a fat, hungry mouse...

22:35.937 --> 22:38.141
a bat mouse in a box with a hungry cat.

22:38.502 --> 22:39.905
What do you think is going to happen?

22:40.386 --> 22:45.717
I said, you have a fiduciary responsibility to understand who gets this.

22:45.797 --> 22:55.617
I said, you have a moral responsibility because I sat there and watched these books of ours being cut apart with the books.

22:55.748 --> 22:56.289
Sold off.

22:56.409 --> 22:57.951
Miniatures, calendars, the whole bit.

22:58.551 --> 22:59.612
From your collection.

22:59.773 --> 23:01.435
This is B.U., you're saying?

23:01.555 --> 23:01.935
Pardon me?

23:01.955 --> 23:04.398
And this is still B.U., you're talking about?

23:04.418 --> 23:04.858
This is B.U., yeah.

23:04.898 --> 23:06.460
This was when you were giving a talk?

23:06.661 --> 23:07.481
Yeah, right.

23:07.501 --> 23:08.042
In the Boston area?

23:08.062 --> 23:10.545
No, that was an informal group in Philadelphia.

23:10.605 --> 23:11.566
It was at the same time?

23:11.826 --> 23:15.491
Yeah, and this guy happened to be there just any— This is pretty recently you gave this stuff?

23:15.511 --> 23:16.352
About three years ago.

23:17.213 --> 23:21.077
Did you have a text for it, or was it— No, no, very much my stuff is very impromptu.

23:21.097 --> 23:22.819
But I have my facts, I mean, I have my notes.

23:22.799 --> 23:26.747
And then the guy challenges me with a typical bureaucratic statement.

23:26.767 --> 23:27.408
A BU guy?

23:28.170 --> 23:28.450
Yeah.

23:28.470 --> 23:31.075
No, this guy was from Getty Museum.

23:31.195 --> 23:31.416
Oh.

23:31.596 --> 23:34.702
Because I was about ready to drop a name on them.

23:34.722 --> 23:45.263
And I said, my problem is you gauge in these million-dollar sales or they'll sell a lot of eight or nine, ten artifacts in return for X number of dollars.

23:45.513 --> 24:07.133
and they'll have private purchasers or they'll put them on auction where they're private purchasers and i said it depending on how the deal works together then these books end up in the hand of a book breaker cuts them apart and the book breakers will cut these these old books apart and then they'll wholesale them the manuscript dealers now courageous advertises in his book phil courageous can we

24:07.501 --> 24:09.164
Can we document a couple of these things?

24:09.184 --> 24:09.384
Oh, yeah.

24:09.404 --> 24:09.545
We can.

24:09.565 --> 24:11.789
A couple of books that we can prove that came from such and such.

24:11.829 --> 24:14.513
We can lead them all together.

24:14.533 --> 24:15.315
Get the catalog it.

24:15.355 --> 24:16.216
Did it go on a sale?

24:16.597 --> 24:17.859
Then we'll follow the book.

24:17.899 --> 24:19.602
This works for this book, unfortunately.

24:19.783 --> 24:21.165
You mean the third one?

24:21.245 --> 24:21.926
The big one.

24:21.967 --> 24:27.576
The one that... We can get... We can get... How about the antiphono of Marguerite de Bocavalle?

24:27.596 --> 24:29.640
Well, that's an impermanence of books.

24:29.700 --> 24:30.201
Because...

24:30.181 --> 24:35.126
I'm writing about the destruction of books in this next book.

24:35.146 --> 24:38.150
We've got a guy in the art history department.

24:38.610 --> 24:40.132
I love something like this.

24:40.152 --> 24:42.634
This is good stuff.

24:42.654 --> 24:49.502
What he talks about is what happens when a book is dispersed like it.

24:49.742 --> 24:58.011
In terms of what you lose, in terms of being able to know about both the book... This is great English.

24:57.991 --> 25:21.973
and everything surrounding it and you'd be an interesting person to talk with and he's been interested in in seeing if you could do a census of leaves and begin to put books back together virtually so that you're at least you could digitally put them put them back together the problem with that and i've tried to put leaves books back together the problem with that is they are sold on the open market

25:21.953 --> 25:27.061
to people who have just enough money to buy them and not enough money to understand what they have.

25:27.422 --> 25:28.904
And so they're hanging in homes.

25:29.125 --> 25:31.248
And I told you the story of the medieval wills.

25:31.268 --> 25:32.350
Well, there's no question, John.

25:32.370 --> 25:34.293
I mean, I'm not going to argue with you about it.

25:34.313 --> 25:35.435
Oh, no, no, I'm not, my friend.

25:35.455 --> 25:36.296
I'm just telling you.

25:36.677 --> 25:38.580
The dispersal, it's a crime.

25:38.640 --> 25:39.621
It is a crime.

25:39.682 --> 25:42.085
His idea is wonderful.

25:42.206 --> 25:43.708
You know, what...

25:44.093 --> 25:45.657
Oh, this is Eric Gables.

25:45.677 --> 25:48.724
He teaches art history here at Oregon.

25:49.305 --> 25:50.488
I-N-G-L-E-S?

25:50.508 --> 25:51.691
I-N-G-L-I-S.

25:52.072 --> 25:53.215
I-N-G-L-I-S.

25:53.816 --> 25:55.661
But I can get you in time.

25:55.681 --> 25:56.362
Just so I know.

25:57.585 --> 25:58.367
No, you're right.

25:58.387 --> 25:59.871
And that's a wonderful thing.

25:59.891 --> 26:00.853
And if we could do it.

26:00.833 --> 26:11.708
It's just that they have made sure that a number of these leads go out into, for lack of another term, hands of people who have no idea what they are.

26:11.748 --> 26:13.170
Remember the story of the medieval wills?

26:13.611 --> 26:21.442
I told you the story of the medieval wills that were bound, and the guy sewed them off as chapter rules, and one of my interns translated them as wills.

26:21.462 --> 26:22.864
It was a whole book of medieval wills.

26:23.324 --> 26:25.187
They were hawked off, broken, sewed off.

26:25.167 --> 26:40.726
The way I got him back, Nick, the guy who broke this book of medieval wills, he took out the miniature, which was a monastic order, he sold it to a private collector, and I know who it was, and then he cut the book off, and he put on him rules of the chapter.

26:40.846 --> 26:41.687
He didn't even read it.

26:41.827 --> 26:44.250
I mean, he can't read it.

26:44.290 --> 26:54.583
One of my interns at the College of Worcester, summer project, had 12 of these hot shot Latin young men, great young men, calls me one night, he says, Professor Lawrence, and I'm not a professor, but he called me a

26:54.884 --> 26:58.431
He said, I'm sure these are chapter rules.

26:58.451 --> 27:01.076
And I go, Jason, what are they?

27:01.096 --> 27:02.278
They're wills.

27:03.220 --> 27:04.382
I said, makes sense.

27:04.442 --> 27:05.364
So we did a research.

27:05.384 --> 27:07.127
He did a paper on it, which I'll supply to you.

27:08.009 --> 27:09.853
And a copy of the paper.

27:09.873 --> 27:14.041
And it turns out this was a bound copy, bound book of wills.

27:14.101 --> 27:16.926
And one of the wills we have says by the scribe,

27:17.075 --> 27:20.461
And a copy of this shall be placed in the monastery's library.

27:20.481 --> 27:21.643
So that's why they were there.

27:21.663 --> 27:24.187
Because the monastery served as a probate court everywhere.

27:24.207 --> 27:26.450
The guy had broken a book of wills.

27:26.551 --> 27:29.816
Now he was selling these for $75 a lease.

27:30.557 --> 27:32.040
And I bought every one I could find.

27:32.961 --> 27:36.207
So I called him up and said, do you know what you took apart?

27:36.307 --> 27:37.108
He goes, no, why?

27:37.578 --> 27:40.081
You took apart a book of medieval wills.

27:40.943 --> 27:44.247
And I think they would have sold for $2,000 each.

27:44.267 --> 27:45.008
Now you do the math.

27:45.028 --> 27:47.411
See, that's where you get out of it.

27:47.531 --> 27:50.676
And he came back and later called me.

27:50.696 --> 27:52.398
So he split the wills apart.

27:52.478 --> 27:53.700
Oh, he split the whole book apart.

27:53.720 --> 27:56.143
And he sold them off as rules of the chapter.

27:56.123 --> 27:58.526
So the people bought these for $75 each.

27:58.926 --> 28:03.051
But in effect, there were intact wills that were split apart in the whole process?

28:03.131 --> 28:04.412
Yeah, where they were intact wills.

28:04.512 --> 28:07.856
Not only were the wills split from the book, the wills were split apart.

28:07.876 --> 28:08.476
That's what I'm saying.

28:08.496 --> 28:09.798
The wills themselves were split.

28:09.878 --> 28:16.565
So that if you don't have the full content of an individual will... See, none of these people can read the language.

28:16.906 --> 28:19.228
No, and he hawked it off.

28:19.546 --> 28:22.671
And I called him up, and I said, these would have went for two grand each.

28:23.112 --> 28:24.374
And that really got him.

28:24.414 --> 28:26.377
I mean, that depressed him for days.

28:26.397 --> 28:32.807
But what I started to say about the Marguerite de Bacobala Tiffano, when the exhibition opens, I'm going to tell the story of her book.

28:33.187 --> 28:35.651
And, you know, before then, hopefully I can tell the story to you.

28:35.771 --> 28:38.255
But it will be in the exhibition, because the scholars want to know.

28:39.037 --> 28:40.659
So I dropped the name to one of these guys.

28:40.679 --> 28:43.123
I said, I'm going to have to start naming names, folks.

28:43.323 --> 28:45.209
And he looked at me and he said, you're not.

28:45.229 --> 28:46.492
I said, I got to.

28:46.613 --> 28:50.464
I said, I can't stand up in front of a group of scholars and dance around.

28:50.484 --> 28:54.295
And every one of these people,

28:54.477 --> 29:18.882
is up to here in their arms in one way or the other courageous philip courageous out in oregon advertises in his book i do not break books no he doesn't he stands while the guy does it i mean he buys it from a book breaker no he doesn't do it himself but he goes in and he buys the leaves from a book book he really specializes in

29:18.862 --> 29:20.364
entire books.

29:20.404 --> 29:23.749
He's more, he's not a real big medieval manuscript dealer.

29:23.989 --> 29:26.072
He's got a good reputation, actually.

29:26.112 --> 29:27.995
He does have one.

29:28.816 --> 29:30.458
But they have to make a living, Nick.

29:30.478 --> 29:31.139
That's how they do this.

29:31.159 --> 29:36.867
John, do you object to this on aesthetic grounds that you have a book that's moral grounds?

29:37.508 --> 29:38.429
On moral grounds?

29:38.549 --> 29:42.955
In terms of every kind of ground you can think of.

29:43.036 --> 29:47.221
Well, first of all, I object to a beautiful intact book being taken apart for any reason.

29:47.321 --> 29:48.463
And I object to

29:48.663 --> 29:53.933
when the objective of taking a part has nothing to do with scholarship and what I call the democratization of history.

29:54.554 --> 29:59.123
The democratization of history is this, like the book of hours I have, you can only enjoy two folios at once.

29:59.684 --> 30:06.857
If you can, if individual collectors out there have a manuscript lead, they become interested in medieval history, renaissance history, writing books,

30:07.040 --> 30:12.767
A lot of these people that I do buy leaves that come leave, take very great care of them.

30:12.927 --> 30:14.229
They're archived rights.

30:14.349 --> 30:14.990
They love them.

30:15.030 --> 30:15.991
They're family heirlooms.

30:16.031 --> 30:16.832
They document them.

30:16.852 --> 30:18.774
I write valuations and descriptions.

30:19.375 --> 30:19.956
So there's that.

30:20.396 --> 30:26.404
But when you're talking a healthy book of hours, a pristine book of hours that's cut apart to accomplish that, that's wrong.

30:26.644 --> 30:33.853
If you have a damaged book that was taken apart, part of it in the 19th century, 18th century, damaged, that's another story.

30:33.873 --> 30:34.954
I've got a book of hours.

30:35.086 --> 30:36.668
that has about 100 leaves in it.

30:36.968 --> 30:37.889
The calendars are gone.

30:37.929 --> 30:38.810
The miniatures are gone.

30:38.830 --> 30:46.438
It was re-sewn in the 60s very badly to put it in a new binding upside down.

30:46.919 --> 30:48.921
I haven't taken that book apart.

30:48.941 --> 30:49.381
I have it.

30:49.822 --> 30:51.003
You know, it's a matter of degree.

30:51.163 --> 31:00.013
There's no difference between what he's talking about and what Baker's talking about with those newspapers coming from the British Library that he chopped up for birthday parties.

31:00.432 --> 31:10.376
With Baker's style, that's a whole other thing.

31:10.457 --> 31:17.614
It's really true that when you film that you lose, with certain thinkers, you lose

31:17.948 --> 31:24.134
an ability to know and understand what that artifact is reflecting.

31:24.154 --> 31:33.083
So with the newspapers, all of those color illustrations, those incredible color illustrations in the early 20th century newspapers, that's just all lost.

31:33.243 --> 31:34.945
I tell a story in the book.

31:35.125 --> 31:43.213
Here, the interesting thing from what Eric was telling me is that when a book is broken like that,

31:43.463 --> 32:13.470
what you lose in terms of your ability to then both understand the book but understand the period and understand the whole culture that it's coming from because you there are certain things that just don't make sense unless you have the whole thing the paratextual elements of the book the whole book as artifact matters it creates something that's easier with synergy you know when i have my collection i still have the prices on it it's where some of these books

32:14.395 --> 32:20.473
people, and I like to call book people, book breakers, will take a leaf and then cut the leaf into squares.

32:20.707 --> 32:22.909
and hawk them off at $25 a square.

32:23.230 --> 32:26.493
Calligraphy shows.

32:30.598 --> 32:33.721
Here is a 12th century cistercen leaf.

32:33.741 --> 32:40.248
Those things retail for like $2,000, but it's fine cistercen script, fine cistercen vellum on parchment.

32:40.649 --> 32:41.089
There is.

32:41.530 --> 32:45.634
Someone cut one of these apart and was hawking them off at $50 a whack.

32:45.614 --> 32:48.619
So now they're not only dividing books, they're dividing links.

32:48.819 --> 32:56.692
Now that has stopped because I said, I told them all that we're doing it, I said, I'm going to really drop a dime on you publicly.

32:56.712 --> 32:58.876
And some of you got, you're trying to sell this.

32:58.916 --> 33:03.203
Now that may sound to you, Nick, like a form of, what is pressure?

33:03.403 --> 33:08.792
Nothing works in a vacuum.

33:08.912 --> 33:09.934
I said, this is going to stop.

33:10.150 --> 33:11.211
I said, it's going to stop now.

33:11.592 --> 33:13.394
I said, I'm going to start talking about this.

33:13.594 --> 33:15.697
And I've got, here I got, I got what you did.

33:16.738 --> 33:20.663
I got the, I got a copy of the, I got a sisterly original book.

33:21.224 --> 33:23.167
I said, you're in trouble.

33:23.868 --> 33:25.049
I said, so you'll cut it now.

33:25.069 --> 33:25.950
You'll cut it today.

33:26.090 --> 33:28.133
I said, I want to see none of this stuff on your market again.

33:28.173 --> 33:29.695
They didn't argue with me.

33:30.164 --> 33:52.105
now i'm not what i'm trying to do give it an exact ebay to see if they stuck them up there no they won't do ebay they don't trust the people there is something on ebay for sale now though but there's i printed i printed it off i have it back in my office there's a bookseller about who's selling bits and pieces of old books he wants to get out of the business apparently

33:52.085 --> 33:58.050
So what's the keyword search?

33:58.070 --> 34:02.114
How would I find that?

34:02.234 --> 34:06.438
I think Leapbook would probably do it, but I have it.

34:06.538 --> 34:13.484
I printed it off because it's just been a big discussion the last couple of days.

34:13.564 --> 34:17.548
It would be very interesting, Nick, what this guy would say to you why he's doing this.

34:17.568 --> 34:20.050
Because I was telling Ray it's gone into the printed box.

34:20.266 --> 34:25.873
The Johannes Mauritius, the Gutenberg of Belgium, and I have an entire missile.

34:26.314 --> 34:29.238
One of these guys bought a processional of his, hacked it apart.

34:29.278 --> 34:31.421
I mean, they've been doing that for years with the Gutenberg Bible.

34:31.781 --> 34:32.963
They leaked books.

34:32.983 --> 34:35.286
You can buy pieces of an accident page.

34:35.306 --> 34:39.631
We've got a few things like that.

34:39.651 --> 34:41.454
That's how things arrive.

34:41.554 --> 34:45.419
I have noticed with the Gutenberg, though, the leaves that were taken out years ago.

34:45.459 --> 34:46.240
They haven't been doing it.

34:46.405 --> 35:08.751
that now they won't touch them because they're too well known they're radioactive because they have too many questions the Tyndale bible one of these guys called me to dinner when I get a Tyndale bible paid a half a million dollars this is four years ago three years ago he shows it to me and I'm looking it's very pristine it's completely extant it's a complete Tyndale and there's 170 of them more than in Gutenberg and uh

35:09.187 --> 35:16.662
He's showing it to me, and we're having dinner, and we're having dinner at his house, and they pour more wine, and I said, what's the pitch?

35:17.785 --> 35:19.709
He said, well, I got an idea.

35:19.729 --> 35:23.837
He said, I paid a half a million for this book, and if we cut this book apart,

35:24.104 --> 35:25.667
No, she used the word we.

35:26.569 --> 35:31.518
He said, I'll make you my partner.

35:31.578 --> 35:33.662
And we take it down to the Bible guy.

35:33.682 --> 35:35.065
He said, we hit the fundamentalists.

35:35.846 --> 35:38.732
And we show them first English Bible.

35:38.852 --> 35:41.156
We hit the anti-papist thing.

35:41.217 --> 35:43.581
He said, you know, we go into the whole thing.

35:43.730 --> 35:45.172
Hey, here are you Christians.

35:45.192 --> 35:46.554
Here's the English Bible.

35:46.734 --> 35:47.755
Here's the first one.

35:47.795 --> 35:49.858
This guy died at the stake for it.

35:49.878 --> 35:52.681
He said, three to five grand a pop.

35:53.062 --> 35:53.742
I said, easy.

35:53.803 --> 35:58.168
So this half a million dollar book is 3.3, 3.4 million overnight.

35:58.929 --> 36:00.571
And he's serious.

36:00.591 --> 36:04.236
So I finished my salad, because I don't eat a salad, and I drink their wine.

36:04.256 --> 36:05.177
Who was this guy?

36:05.497 --> 36:09.422
I'll name Nick later, because I can't prove this.

36:09.742 --> 36:10.884
This was in the Midwest.

36:11.785 --> 36:12.606
And I said to him,

36:13.261 --> 36:16.608
I said, first of all, it's not we.

36:17.571 --> 36:19.435
I said, I want nothing to do with this.

36:19.455 --> 36:22.261
And I said, and secondly, you're not going to do it.

36:22.281 --> 36:22.822
He said, why?

36:22.903 --> 36:28.675
I said, I'd sure hate for the art critic, the New York Times, the Chicago Tribune, and the LA Times get a hold of this.

36:29.598 --> 36:32.063
I said, I want to go on record saying I won't be the one to call it.

36:32.532 --> 36:35.857
And I said, I won't be the one to point the finger.

36:36.017 --> 36:37.259
I said, I want to go on record sync.

36:37.319 --> 36:38.061
I won't do it.

36:38.081 --> 36:40.725
He said, well, then you feel that there's going to be a problem.

36:40.745 --> 36:42.107
And I said, yes, and you do too.

36:42.387 --> 36:45.532
Or you wouldn't have me here dinner serving expensive wine and salad.

36:45.813 --> 36:46.554
You wouldn't do this.

36:47.675 --> 36:49.418
And I said, you've got a problem.

36:49.799 --> 36:51.261
This book is too well known.

36:52.363 --> 36:53.865
It's therefore radioactive.

36:53.845 --> 36:56.351
And if you're stupid enough to break it apart... Wait a minute.

36:56.391 --> 36:58.876
I mean, is this... If it's well known, it's radioactive.

36:58.896 --> 37:01.081
Yeah, but I mean, was the Pobinots okay on it?

37:01.141 --> 37:02.043
Oh, yeah, it was clear.

37:02.063 --> 37:04.329
It was a clear... Yeah, a title to it.

37:04.369 --> 37:05.531
Oh, yeah, there was a clear title.

37:05.551 --> 37:08.017
I mean, the title was irrelevant to these guys.

37:08.037 --> 37:08.297
Okay?

37:08.317 --> 37:11.685
I mean, we're talking about whether the book is prestigious enough or not

37:11.868 --> 37:13.991
that they can get away without notoriety.

37:14.011 --> 37:15.212
But it wasn't in bad shape.

37:15.613 --> 37:16.554
No, it was perfect.

37:16.574 --> 37:22.241
Well, the only thing, the only thing that makes it radioactive was the potential reaction.

37:22.301 --> 37:23.102
That's what I meant.

37:23.222 --> 37:25.866
I said, you know, and they bounced off.

37:25.886 --> 37:31.793
He said, so you, you know, and if somebody is willing to withstand the criticism, they can just say, I'm going to make it happen.

37:31.833 --> 37:32.915
He said, well, but they can't.

37:33.095 --> 37:34.897
They can't stand the criticism.

37:34.917 --> 37:35.618
That's the point.

37:35.979 --> 37:36.740
They can't do it.

37:36.860 --> 37:40.204
Because that kind of criticism spills over to their other business activities.

37:40.420 --> 37:43.243
I like this gentleman that you mentioned, Tinscher.

37:43.323 --> 37:44.805
Is that his name?

37:44.845 --> 37:45.726
Yeah.

37:45.766 --> 37:48.429
But he keeps his name clean, see.

37:48.449 --> 37:55.056
He can't afford to be associated with something where that's happening because some of the people he deals with won't have anything to do with you.

37:55.076 --> 38:01.183
And so in the case of the Tyndale, now you're going to have religious groups, no matter what his reason was.

38:01.223 --> 38:03.666
So I went through the whole list of people who are going to come in on this.

38:04.147 --> 38:05.528
And I said, the book is radioactive.

38:05.548 --> 38:06.329
It's too well known.

38:06.930 --> 38:07.490
Leave it alone.

38:07.811 --> 38:08.892
I said, sell it off.

38:09.310 --> 38:15.864
find a seminary, and I found a seminary for him, and he sold it off and made a huge profit.

38:15.884 --> 38:17.567
Then, a year later, he walks in.

38:18.049 --> 38:19.572
He said, did you see the Sotheby's auction?

38:19.612 --> 38:20.233
I said, no, why?

38:20.253 --> 38:23.761
He said, they sold a 10-delvety for $1.3 million.

38:23.781 --> 38:24.182
I said, so?

38:25.164 --> 38:27.268
He said, well, if I'd held on to it, I said, you can't hold on to it.

38:27.552 --> 38:53.340
well you don't know what that bible might have had that his did to you know the burland shakespeare sells for six million dollars yeah but and then the second folio goes for half a million and fred bass says well i've got a second folio but maybe that means it's now worth 150 this this was a this was a very good it doesn't necessarily mean that copy of this the leaves were pristine and uh so he knew he knew that he shouldn't do it he knew he wasn't going to do it

38:53.320 --> 38:54.482
working to dinner.

38:54.502 --> 38:56.545
And what I did is do this, pushing.

38:56.805 --> 38:57.486
And that was it.

38:57.506 --> 38:58.187
And he didn't argue.

38:58.308 --> 39:02.053
And within a week, the book was sold to somebody who did it.

39:02.194 --> 39:03.416
And he got a nice number.

39:03.836 --> 39:05.098
He made a nice profit.

39:05.138 --> 39:06.460
He paid $4 million on it.

39:06.500 --> 39:07.522
I mean, that's not a bad report.

39:07.542 --> 39:08.023
How much did he make?

39:08.043 --> 39:08.483
$4 million.

39:08.824 --> 39:09.465
Sold for $750.

39:09.845 --> 39:10.266
Nothing.

39:10.567 --> 39:12.650
But see, that isn't as much as $4 million, Nick.

39:13.031 --> 39:14.413
Nick, you have to understand.

39:14.433 --> 39:17.598
If you have $4 million, you're going to have to work for that $4 million.

39:17.618 --> 39:20.082
You're going to have to work them up page by page, too.

39:20.123 --> 39:21.365
Not really.

39:21.725 --> 39:22.687
I mean, some books.

39:22.747 --> 39:30.820
Now, the Bockevel thing, the Hildenseiners backfired on it because they paid so much money for the book, and the books believe they're selling.

39:30.840 --> 39:34.185
And I've had a little bit to do with that, too.

39:34.285 --> 39:35.848
That was originally in the...

39:36.284 --> 39:44.381
That's the one that was in the getty, right?

39:44.441 --> 39:47.467
That was the one I had here, those leaves I had here.

39:47.587 --> 39:53.860
I'm trying to remember, did one of those go to our English professor?

39:53.881 --> 39:56.065
Yeah, I got one of the leaves.

39:56.416 --> 39:59.621
and sold it because I know where it's at.

39:59.641 --> 40:02.466
See, I'm doing the census of who owns these as much as I can.

40:02.806 --> 40:06.492
Anyway, Nick, there's many more stories.

40:07.834 --> 40:10.038
I will be happy to work with you on this.

40:10.439 --> 40:11.961
You're a great author.

40:12.127 --> 40:14.131
and you're certainly a person who can tell it.

40:14.211 --> 40:19.603
This would be a pretty good story to... Ray's heard all this to a great degree.

40:19.643 --> 40:22.028
How long have you been collecting?

40:22.229 --> 40:22.910
30 years.

40:24.634 --> 40:29.865
How I got started, I was a college student, watched the kind of gradual part,

40:29.845 --> 40:32.369
in the student commons at 10 bucks a leaf.

40:32.449 --> 40:35.515
And I used a year's worth of food.

40:36.336 --> 40:38.420
The check is on me.

40:38.460 --> 40:41.365
Did somebody pick up the check?

40:41.545 --> 40:46.073
No, she picked it up.

40:46.694 --> 40:48.597
And I started there, and then over the years,

40:48.577 --> 40:50.880
I collected pieces here and there.

40:50.900 --> 40:51.701
I had to get to the top.

40:51.721 --> 40:55.265
Yeah, but did you start, I mean, was it the breaks, the broken books?

40:55.586 --> 41:01.313
The broken books, I got my first lease from a guy who was breaking a book for ten bucks a week.

41:01.753 --> 41:09.703
From the beginning, because of my love of history and my love of books, I felt almost a violence down to that.

41:09.903 --> 41:13.167
So what you're collecting interest in has been focused at this time?

41:13.433 --> 41:19.308
opposing this, my whole collecting interest has been preservation, keep grabbing, preserving love of books.

41:19.328 --> 41:20.777
I mean, it's not just narrow.

41:21.128 --> 41:25.194
And I've done more collecting and preservation than I've been able to do the scholarship.

41:25.214 --> 41:30.501
If I had my way, I'd lock my house door, unplug the phone, and spend a year just working with my lease.

41:30.541 --> 41:31.703
I don't even have a catalog.

41:31.723 --> 41:37.832
I was telling Ray I started to do a catalog because I had no idea of the number of lease I have, and it's getting huge.

41:37.852 --> 41:39.154
I mean, I had no idea.

41:40.095 --> 41:43.320
But these are lease largely from broken books, though, right?

41:43.420 --> 41:46.444
Some of them were from broken books, contemporary, some of them from broken books.

41:46.424 --> 41:48.286
Three centuries ago, I have entire books.

41:48.306 --> 41:53.232
I mean, I've got a book, I've got not only a printed book of ours, I have a very beautiful high renaissance book of ours.

41:53.333 --> 41:59.841
I have a Missal, the woman's Dominican Brewery, I've got Cistercen printed, Typhenol.

42:00.001 --> 42:07.730
So you're really collecting things while at the same time you're crusading against the practice that makes this kind of collectible possible.

42:08.031 --> 42:10.213
Is that right?

42:10.514 --> 42:11.375
Right, right.

42:11.955 --> 42:14.018
But my objective of collecting is not to go,

42:13.998 --> 42:21.811
See, one of the great things about your book, my student lecture, is you capture the psychology so beautifully.

42:22.251 --> 42:25.136
I mean, it is marvelously told.

42:25.256 --> 42:29.824
And I recommend your book, and I give your book as copies by students.

42:29.844 --> 42:35.112
And I'll have students come back when I do seminars, and I'll say, read that thing, read this chapter, read that chapter.

42:35.132 --> 42:39.820
The stories, the stories of the eccentric people, the extent they will do, they'll climb up an elevator shaft.

42:40.154 --> 43:00.390
this is the mentality of the people i deal with and um of course i've been involved too with authenticating stolen leaves like the vatican leaves the melicoes thing where he went into the vatican library and stole the leaves he was from ohio state that's right yeah and the way he did it he went in in july he first of all

43:00.556 --> 43:05.783
Professor Melikos is one of the most personal people you meet.

43:05.803 --> 43:06.624
Yeah, I've heard that.

43:06.664 --> 43:10.248
Yeah, and I mean a bull crapper from day one, a charmer.

43:10.929 --> 43:13.172
And he became very good friends with Father Boyle.

43:13.412 --> 43:17.117
Father Boyle's in this book will be a greater extent in the next book.

43:17.137 --> 43:18.639
And they became best of buds.

43:19.320 --> 43:24.647
So he'd let Melikos in there in July when the Vatican libraries closed for maintenance.

43:24.667 --> 43:27.070
Melikos would sit there then with a penknife

43:27.252 --> 43:28.793
Open a leaf, and you go like this.

43:28.914 --> 43:30.135
Now, here's what happened.

43:30.155 --> 43:31.096
I get a call at 2 a.m.

43:31.116 --> 43:33.438
in the morning by one of the top people.

43:33.498 --> 43:34.419
Did you know this story?

43:36.801 --> 43:38.262
I followed it, but yeah, go ahead.

43:38.282 --> 43:40.104
So anyway, I get a call, and he says, you've got to come.

43:40.124 --> 43:41.425
I says, 2 in the morning, damn it.

43:41.445 --> 43:42.686
Bruce, bring me.

43:42.706 --> 43:44.227
He says, Bruce, I said, you've got to get up.

43:44.248 --> 43:45.248
You've got to get up there.

43:45.288 --> 43:46.690
So your house on fire, do you want me to help you?

43:46.710 --> 43:47.671
He goes, oh, get up here.

43:47.691 --> 43:48.311
Get up here, damn it.

43:48.331 --> 43:49.292
I've been up for three days.

43:49.312 --> 43:49.672
Get up here.

43:50.093 --> 43:51.474
So Bruce, it's 2 in the morning.

43:51.494 --> 43:52.155
I said, get up here.

43:52.335 --> 43:54.677
I said, put the coffee on, and I get up there on Easter.

43:55.602 --> 43:57.566
I said, Bruce, what happened?

43:57.646 --> 43:59.410
He said, come here, I want you to show me.

43:59.430 --> 44:00.412
I want you to tell me something.

44:00.472 --> 44:01.655
His son, Matt, is there.

44:02.537 --> 44:04.741
And they're both standing there, both of them pale.

44:04.761 --> 44:05.723
He said, what do you think of this?

44:06.324 --> 44:15.163
And there is a large leaf, beautiful, high renaissance illumination of an agriculture tree that looked like this, Nick.

44:15.886 --> 44:19.210
And I said, he said, what do you think of us?

44:19.230 --> 44:22.153
I said, who in the hell did this?

44:23.414 --> 44:25.236
And he said, what else do you think about?

44:25.256 --> 44:27.999
I said, Bruce, there's a problem here.

44:28.039 --> 44:29.441
No one does this to a leaf.

44:30.462 --> 44:31.563
And this is how it was presented.

44:31.583 --> 44:33.085
He said, yeah, it was presented for me to sell.

44:33.325 --> 44:35.027
The guy wants $400,000 for him.

44:35.107 --> 44:36.469
I said, well, it's worth that.

44:37.209 --> 44:38.191
And I said, you know what it is?

44:38.891 --> 44:42.215
He said, Jim Merrill authenticated it this afternoon.

44:43.076 --> 44:45.859
This is a large, beautiful,

44:46.396 --> 44:48.401
illumination from a treatise on agriculture.

44:48.642 --> 44:51.549
And this is Petrarch's describing.

44:52.051 --> 44:53.073
And he cut right through it.

44:53.294 --> 45:02.658
And I said, and by the way, it was in the Vatican Museum, a Vatican library in, trying to think of the dates.

45:02.678 --> 45:03.460
And he said,

45:03.490 --> 45:05.052
We have the catalog.

45:05.232 --> 45:05.853
No, no, thank you.

45:06.594 --> 45:08.416
We have the catalog to it.

45:08.496 --> 45:11.139
And he said, here it is.

45:11.399 --> 45:13.982
I said, what do you need me here for?

45:14.102 --> 45:15.003
You've got a problem.

45:15.023 --> 45:16.725
This is a highly stolen leaf.

45:17.586 --> 45:18.427
He said, what do we do?

45:18.648 --> 45:19.809
I said, well, you know what we're going to do.

45:20.109 --> 45:22.392
First of all, we're going to call the FBI.

45:23.473 --> 45:29.380
And we actually called customs because it was a law that's fairly new on importation of stolen antiquities.

45:29.680 --> 45:32.044
Well, I mean, did you know it was the Vatican straight away?

45:32.104 --> 45:35.249
Right away, he calls the Vatican, talks to Father Boyle.

45:35.469 --> 45:38.073
And the Vatican is going all, they're going berserk.

45:39.715 --> 45:43.902
And then all at once, he said, well, check your stacks, here it is, this, this, this.

45:44.122 --> 45:46.526
All at once, they call him back in daylight and say, forget about it.

45:46.826 --> 45:48.749
Put it in the mail, send it to us.

45:48.910 --> 45:50.612
And he goes, whoa, whoa, wait a minute, what's going on?

45:51.534 --> 45:52.435
Well, we knew what's going on.

45:52.695 --> 45:53.697
They checked their stacks.

45:54.014 --> 46:08.192
they check where dr malikos has been and everything's missing i mean the guy there was even remnants of the leaf i mean just kind of and so boyle covered up now boyle wasn't responsible no poor man he cardinal

46:09.100 --> 46:11.805
The guy he worked for.

46:11.985 --> 46:15.853
And this guy is an old guard, prince of the church.

46:16.133 --> 46:19.379
The cardinal forced Boyle for that.

46:19.399 --> 46:21.443
Boyle would not have done that.

46:21.563 --> 46:23.627
Boyle was known for opening the Vatican Library.

46:23.647 --> 46:26.172
The scholars were for being proactive.

46:26.252 --> 46:28.777
I think he was an Irish Benedictine, wasn't he?

46:28.797 --> 46:30.079
Wonderful guy.

46:30.295 --> 46:32.679
He had been a very trusting, loving man.

46:32.859 --> 46:33.941
No, he's Irish.

46:34.121 --> 46:38.087
He was at the Pontifical Institute in Canada for about 20 years.

46:38.107 --> 46:40.511
And he went from there to the Vatican Library.

46:40.631 --> 46:43.996
And Mellon Post and him were friends.

46:44.177 --> 46:46.741
And he gets this order, and he's totally in communion.

46:46.801 --> 46:48.203
So Customs comes in.

46:48.183 --> 47:06.040
we give them the story they got patience and fortitude just while you're talking i'll show you something there's a picture of it well i took it yeah i interviewed you took it yeah i interviewed um anyway this goes a step further um the father boils is just send it back

47:06.374 --> 47:07.175
Forget it.

47:08.096 --> 47:09.719
And we said, no, we're not sending anything back.

47:09.739 --> 47:11.081
I said, this has gone too far.

47:11.421 --> 47:12.483
We've contacted U.S.

47:12.523 --> 47:13.003
authorities.

47:13.023 --> 47:13.985
No, you don't.

47:14.005 --> 47:15.226
And we're contacting Liverpool.

47:16.328 --> 47:19.032
And we're going to contact the Italian authorities.

47:20.193 --> 47:22.176
He was such a trusting guy.

47:22.236 --> 47:24.980
He said, the Vatican is a sovereign state.

47:25.180 --> 47:28.545
And he said, we will not cooperate with U.S.

47:28.605 --> 47:29.046
authorities.

47:29.246 --> 47:30.468
By the way, later.

47:30.488 --> 47:31.529
So that was him.

47:32.150 --> 47:32.871
Poor man.

47:32.851 --> 47:35.174
And there's a long footnote on him.

47:35.194 --> 47:37.318
And I'll be writing about him in the next book.

47:37.338 --> 47:41.223
And so within a week, we get the word back that the Vatican will not cooperate with any U.S.

47:41.243 --> 47:41.764
authorities.

47:42.665 --> 47:43.627
They will not engage him.

47:43.647 --> 47:46.371
So he said, now we start bringing him.

47:46.391 --> 47:50.957
Melanchol runs off and hires one of the top criminal attorneys in Columbus, which is in chief.

47:51.118 --> 47:53.641
Now I start finding out a lot about this guy.

47:53.661 --> 47:55.324
This guy's got a house full of art.

47:55.784 --> 47:56.806
And he invites people in.

47:57.928 --> 47:59.490
And people are allowed to photograph this art.

47:59.530 --> 48:01.693
Now, you've got to understand in his books,

48:02.045 --> 48:21.910
that this isn't normal okay this is not normal behavior and and so i said you know bruce do you have some of those photographs we get some photographs customs comes in they do an investigation vatican emits is theirs there's documentary crews but they won't do anything so

48:23.122 --> 48:26.028
Then they get into an issue of bringing experts over.

48:26.048 --> 48:32.741
His attorney contacts these European experts and says, oh, by the way, back in 1978, we did a research.

48:32.801 --> 48:37.350
You got involved in a book that had a dubious provenance.

48:37.370 --> 48:38.132
Who's saying this now?

48:38.453 --> 48:39.074
His attorney.

48:39.595 --> 48:41.198
So when you come over here to the U.S.,

48:41.752 --> 48:46.978
to testify, that is going to go to the heart of public testimony about your credentials.

48:46.998 --> 48:49.661
So all over Europe, they said, we're not coming over.

48:49.681 --> 48:50.702
We're not going to make anything.

48:51.863 --> 48:58.891
Jim Merrill, who authenticated this at Princeton, and very much against any of this, here's where it goes a step further.

48:59.292 --> 49:07.981
Boyle then issues a statement under orders from Steckler, or Steckler, or whatever they might just name, that the manuscript is only worth $10,000.

49:08.082 --> 49:09.844
Now, see, that affects U.S.

49:10.104 --> 49:11.185
sentencing guidelines.

49:11.840 --> 49:13.062
Excuse me.

49:15.305 --> 49:16.607
This guy just issued a statement.

49:16.627 --> 49:18.510
This thing's only worth 10 grand.

49:18.530 --> 49:19.672
It's worth half a million.

49:19.772 --> 49:20.653
Easy.

49:20.914 --> 49:22.576
So I'm giving a speech that night.

49:23.578 --> 49:26.282
And I said, ladies and gentlemen, I have here a fact to tell me a story.

49:26.783 --> 49:28.706
Dressed to Father Boy of the Vatican Library.

49:28.766 --> 49:33.232
I am offering Holy Mother of the Church, St.

49:33.252 --> 49:35.416
Nicholas of Valona, which is worth $25,000.

49:35.536 --> 49:36.998
You've seen St.

49:37.479 --> 49:38.741
Nicholas.

49:38.901 --> 49:39.602
In return,

49:40.662 --> 49:42.985
for the Petrarch manuscript.

49:43.005 --> 49:48.051
And please, will the Church keep the rest of the value as a donation and an offering of my goodwill?

49:48.692 --> 49:50.174
I said, I want no thank you and the whole bit.

49:50.194 --> 49:53.058
And they were laughing, and I faxed it to the Vatican.

49:53.318 --> 49:53.819
Not a word.

49:53.999 --> 49:59.125
So anyway, they take this thing in.

49:59.145 --> 50:01.188
Excuse me, I'm killing this.

50:01.208 --> 50:05.894
Anyway, they take this thing in to the Vatican.

50:05.914 --> 50:07.716
The FBI takes it in, all right?

50:08.320 --> 50:11.384
And they said, well, you know, this guy's, here was his argument.

50:11.444 --> 50:13.307
You know what his argument was, Nick?

50:13.327 --> 50:16.171
He got mixed up in my papers.

50:16.191 --> 50:17.092
Well, how'd he get out of the book?

50:17.112 --> 50:18.674
Did this guy do this any time, by the way?

50:18.734 --> 50:19.776
Well, he did, eventually.

50:19.816 --> 50:20.477
But he won.

50:20.517 --> 50:22.880
He's 65, 66, 67.

50:24.322 --> 50:26.485
So then we started doing a check on this guy.

50:26.505 --> 50:30.531
This guy had access to every major library in Europe.

50:30.711 --> 50:31.191
Everyone.

50:31.211 --> 50:33.955
In minor monasteries, priories.

50:33.975 --> 50:35.998
The only one who kept an eye on him was the English.

50:36.248 --> 50:37.430
They kept an eye on him.

50:37.450 --> 50:38.091
He didn't touch them.

50:38.111 --> 50:40.375
They kept an eye on him.

50:40.395 --> 50:42.919
So we started doing some background check on this guy.

50:44.121 --> 50:49.069
Then they sent out photographs from his house of these large manuscripts.

50:49.089 --> 50:53.577
And one of his specialties, Bellicose, was the Codex, the Justinian Codex.

50:53.597 --> 50:56.521
And there was, he did a book on Justinian Codex.

50:56.541 --> 51:00.588
It was a horrible book, but Cardinal Steckler had his name in it.

51:00.608 --> 51:01.750
There was a rash.

51:02.017 --> 51:06.584
of sales of Justinian Kodai on the market over a 10-year period.

51:06.864 --> 51:08.707
I went back, an unusual moment.

51:08.727 --> 51:17.500
So I started to look at who was the hawkers at Sotheby's Christie's, Anonymous, some little interior decorating house in Pittsburgh, you know, been in business five years.

51:17.800 --> 51:20.545
How did those get through places like that?

51:20.565 --> 51:22.287
Oh, Nick will tell you that.

51:22.888 --> 51:24.210
Do this, do this.

51:24.798 --> 51:26.340
I didn't do it.

51:26.821 --> 51:27.522
Okay.

51:27.942 --> 51:33.449
Well, we assume that every work offered to us... No, not blatant.

51:33.529 --> 51:34.631
No, they're not blatant.

51:34.691 --> 51:36.273
Because they're libel if it's stolen.

51:36.373 --> 51:38.376
No, they're not blatant.

51:38.396 --> 51:40.739
They issue all sorts of disclaimers.

51:40.759 --> 51:44.604
So what happened was... You have to have clear title to it, generally speaking.

51:44.624 --> 51:46.927
Well, but what is clear title?

51:47.087 --> 51:50.612
The documentary trail in some of these is non-existent.

51:50.632 --> 51:54.096
So what comes out is we send out... Bruce sends out...

51:54.667 --> 51:59.173
to different scholars, pictures of some cobalt.

51:59.193 --> 52:11.350
A researcher at the Morgan Library notices one of them, and identifies it as belonging to the cathedral in Toledo, Spain.

52:11.410 --> 52:14.334
So she contacts it, and sure enough, contact the cathedral.

52:14.394 --> 52:19.461
In 1970, there it is in the catalog, and in 1973, Mellon Post was there.

52:19.802 --> 52:22.125
Now, all hell breaks loose.

52:22.477 --> 52:25.946
What was missing from Toledo, Spain?

52:26.708 --> 52:30.217
Two very large illuminated... Two leaves?

52:30.437 --> 52:30.818
Three.

52:30.839 --> 52:32.804
There were still leaves from that.

52:32.864 --> 52:36.874
But didn't you just check the books that he signed out?

52:37.141 --> 52:39.365
Don't you have to sign out everything?

52:39.645 --> 52:41.007
You're supposed to, but do they?

52:41.228 --> 52:41.408
No.

52:41.708 --> 52:44.934
I mean, people were trying, people were running, Nick, to cover themselves.

52:45.274 --> 52:47.959
Now, he was just left alone.

52:48.259 --> 52:50.783
No, he was left alone.

52:51.064 --> 52:52.706
Nick, he brought in a briefcase every day.

52:52.786 --> 52:55.070
Don't they know the books that he asked to see?

52:55.190 --> 52:56.132
Sure, sure.

52:56.152 --> 52:59.477
That's why they called back within a day or two and went nuts.

52:59.497 --> 53:01.220
Because they went over the things that he had looked at.

53:01.240 --> 53:02.322
Well, they only had to open one.

53:02.808 --> 53:05.472
and find out that half of it's probably gone.

53:05.492 --> 53:10.080
So the Spanish were contacted, and they went berserk.

53:10.100 --> 53:11.963
They wanted his body.

53:12.023 --> 53:12.704
And so U.S.

53:12.764 --> 53:19.235
Customs came in with a search warrant, and by the way, his attorney said, here's the one you want, and by the way, here's three more.

53:20.156 --> 53:21.959
Well, the Spanish are going nuts.

53:21.979 --> 53:22.881
They want him.

53:22.901 --> 53:27.448
They're going to put him in a Spanish prison from which he'll never come out.

53:28.036 --> 53:28.839
He goes to trial.

53:29.039 --> 53:29.822
He's elderly.

53:30.143 --> 53:31.588
He gets all, you know, he's sick.

53:31.749 --> 53:32.371
His wife's sick.

53:32.853 --> 53:34.599
The judge has been sensing on it.

53:34.619 --> 53:37.067
She gets so many letters from art historians

53:37.503 --> 53:40.087
and library people saying the damage this guy has done.

53:40.107 --> 53:42.011
She sent him away, I think it was for 18 months.

53:42.371 --> 53:45.857
I've got all the documents.

53:46.919 --> 53:51.086
Mellencos was originally a Lutheranian immigrant, supposedly.

53:51.106 --> 53:52.469
Where was the trombus?

53:52.489 --> 53:52.850
The what?

53:52.930 --> 53:54.272
Where was his trombus?

53:54.713 --> 53:55.795
Columbus.

53:56.315 --> 54:00.102
The last couple of years, last Friday?

54:00.588 --> 54:02.710
By 1996, yeah.

54:02.730 --> 54:13.199
I've got a whole file on it you can have, including original articles from magazines and everything that did interviews with him.

54:13.359 --> 54:14.700
And you can start from there.

54:14.720 --> 54:16.001
We're here in Worcester, right?

54:16.201 --> 54:18.063
Yeah, I live in Worcester.

54:18.083 --> 54:19.024
How far is that from here?

54:19.224 --> 54:20.946
It's not by the Crow, unfortunately.

54:20.966 --> 54:23.067
It's about an hour and a half other ways.

54:23.728 --> 54:29.633
But at any rate, some melancholy goes to the camp.

54:30.001 --> 54:34.330
Then the real question is, what else is missing, which has never got to the bottom of?

54:35.713 --> 54:36.896
But he'd been all over the place.

54:37.497 --> 54:39.060
He'd been all over these libraries.

54:39.722 --> 54:44.672
And Father Boyle, I understood as a result of this, and I don't know this is the case.

54:44.693 --> 54:45.394
You know him.

54:45.847 --> 54:46.468
retired.

54:46.950 --> 54:48.173
Well, he was forced out.

54:48.213 --> 54:49.415
Well, that was part of it.

54:49.436 --> 55:01.003
This was it, and the idea, and really, what we really did him in was that woman from California, also at the Artists of the Cardinal, to sell the rights to the digitization of the stuff.

55:00.983 --> 55:03.586
And that's really the thing.

55:03.606 --> 55:05.387
It was a huge piece in The New Yorker.

55:05.828 --> 55:07.249
It was all one-sided.

55:07.269 --> 55:10.713
He got once blamed, and he took the hit.

55:10.833 --> 55:13.536
Read the long footnote that I have on him in here.

55:13.836 --> 55:15.918
He's a decent guy.

55:15.978 --> 55:21.023
I talked to him on the phone when I sent the fax.

55:21.043 --> 55:23.846
I called him up, and they put him on, which was surprised.

55:23.866 --> 55:28.631
And I said, Father, you got to receive my fax.

55:28.811 --> 55:30.653
And he said, yes, I did.

55:31.190 --> 55:32.392
I said, Father, I meant it.

55:32.412 --> 55:36.717
I said, with all due respect, if you really feel this way, I will not only give you St.

55:36.737 --> 55:41.203
Nicholas of Bologna, which is a very rare miniature, 12th century.

55:41.223 --> 55:43.306
I will give you some other things.

55:43.326 --> 55:44.087
He said, we don't need it.

55:44.388 --> 55:46.170
I said, well, I know you don't need it.

55:46.190 --> 55:47.652
I said, but would you accept my offering?

55:47.692 --> 55:48.493
He said, no.

55:49.294 --> 55:50.816
I said, well, I understand, Father.

55:50.836 --> 55:51.737
I just wanted to make sure.

55:52.278 --> 55:54.060
But he seemed very upset.

55:54.541 --> 55:57.785
You could tell he was under tremendous pressure.

55:57.825 --> 55:59.728
He was under pressure.

55:59.877 --> 56:02.320
He died a very broken man.

56:02.640 --> 56:04.583
We need to get you to do this.

56:04.743 --> 56:05.484
I'm sorry.

56:05.824 --> 56:06.745
I'm sorry.

56:06.825 --> 56:11.050
No, no, don't be sorry.

56:11.070 --> 56:12.832
It's Robin here in Tucson.

56:12.932 --> 56:18.579
Ask me if I wouldn't do it after the binding.

56:18.599 --> 56:28.551
I have to, what's been fun, like, being involved with, say, you know, something about exhibition.

56:32.159 --> 56:38.087
There are chairs that are emblematic.

56:38.107 --> 56:40.870
Every little inch, you know, meant something, you know.

56:42.092 --> 56:46.157
And this was like a kitchen and a playroom or something or other.

56:48.620 --> 56:53.066
Closed it up, and then, of course, did the two rooms together.

56:53.086 --> 56:53.827
You just do it.

56:54.708 --> 56:57.011
You think... The house is a museum, actually, isn't it?

56:57.031 --> 56:58.673
Yeah, well, everything has...

56:59.041 --> 57:01.324
significance.

57:03.606 --> 57:05.829
All of this I think is a joy.

57:09.353 --> 57:25.911
The Bible and art, in about the 30s, about 28 to 30s, and what happened was I began to see Pater Bear, and of course Pater Bear is just pasty.

57:25.931 --> 57:27.613
What happened was they realized

57:27.863 --> 57:37.434
that the ancients had done this with just crushed glass that was put in rough kind of a thing in Paris, you see.

57:37.895 --> 57:41.679
So therefore, it's very, yes, you see.

57:42.080 --> 57:50.850
So that's, for example, when we had this, which, so therefore, when I did

57:51.134 --> 57:56.881
They change your mind to do sports, you know, or use that kind of thing, you know.

57:56.982 --> 58:00.166
All right, we'll just go through here.

58:02.228 --> 58:06.133
Well, I want to make sure, the reason I kept this place, I thought, oh, well, I have a place.

58:06.474 --> 58:10.999
But here we have some of the grants of Phillips, you see.

58:11.780 --> 58:15.505
And I peeked in the window here.

58:15.525 --> 58:17.648
You say, how is it happening in the window?

58:17.965 --> 58:22.251
I picked in the window, and I said, great.

58:22.271 --> 58:27.478
Of course, I thought it was argument, you know, but of course, this is the kind of thing.

58:27.498 --> 58:28.900
You've got a Columbus letter?

58:29.381 --> 58:30.623
Yes.

58:30.643 --> 58:31.524
I've got it put away.

58:31.864 --> 58:32.646
Right, that's pretty good.

58:33.086 --> 58:35.630
We're in the bathroom now.

58:36.110 --> 58:38.033
Yes, but look, you see, yeah.

58:38.232 --> 58:45.360
Where was I going to put it?

58:45.380 --> 58:48.043
These were all of the honorable books, you see.

58:48.864 --> 58:56.853
So therefore, that's the kind of thing, like all of these things, you see.

58:56.953 --> 58:59.837
I like the fact that you still keep some towels in the bathroom.

59:01.499 --> 59:04.442
And I purposely do this so people can go away.

59:05.350 --> 59:08.354
I won't take long, Sam, I promise.

59:09.516 --> 59:11.719
Come back sometime.

59:12.139 --> 59:13.060
Yeah.

59:13.080 --> 59:14.162
Bring your daughter, maybe.

59:14.282 --> 59:15.283
My daughter or my wife.

59:15.524 --> 59:17.026
Well, yeah, it doesn't matter.

59:17.266 --> 59:18.468
I'd love to bring that.

59:18.508 --> 59:19.329
Oh, let me get that for you.

59:19.709 --> 59:25.918
One day, Sam, you should do books that I have Russian.

59:27.520 --> 59:29.042
That's rather interesting.

59:29.983 --> 59:32.286
Have you ever thought of doing a catalog of your collection?

59:33.093 --> 59:44.188
I've never seen anything like this.

59:45.069 --> 59:45.690
I'm dazzled.

59:45.750 --> 59:51.658
I can only spend a little bit of time here.

59:52.043 --> 59:53.465
I knew Eddie.

59:53.545 --> 59:54.947
I interviewed him.

59:55.087 --> 59:55.648
Lovely man.

59:55.668 --> 59:56.889
He was a wonderful man.

59:57.150 --> 59:58.031
Of course, very sweet.

59:58.051 --> 59:59.132
He was unintelligent.

59:59.653 --> 01:00:00.774
He did feel good.

01:00:00.855 --> 01:00:02.317
And he had that background, you know.

01:00:02.397 --> 01:00:03.899
He had the Rosenbach connection.

01:00:04.119 --> 01:00:08.284
Yeah, so I did some nice... Oh, the Athenaeum.

01:00:08.445 --> 01:00:11.048
At the Athenaeum, which they asked me to do.

01:00:11.956 --> 01:00:13.117
It was very unusual.

01:00:13.177 --> 01:00:16.021
Women weren't doing anything without books.

01:00:16.041 --> 01:00:20.546
I didn't realize it was as if they were treating me as if I had come out of the woodwork.

01:00:20.586 --> 01:00:23.769
Being a self-student, it didn't bother me.

01:00:24.770 --> 01:00:38.065
I used... and she spent five minutes

01:00:38.264 --> 01:00:41.648
They had to pull away from Tom, $55,000.

01:00:42.048 --> 01:00:46.693
So everybody's going to, you know, enjoy what you want.

01:00:46.713 --> 01:00:54.922
But that, you know, the point is to make people feel as if they knew about it, but you're just recalling it to them, right?

01:00:54.942 --> 01:00:58.746
Nouveau and saying, oh, well, you know this piece because of, you know.

01:00:59.407 --> 01:01:03.512
And the more I'm involved in what you were trying to do.

01:01:03.532 --> 01:01:05.253
But you're still succeeding, though.

01:01:05.594 --> 01:01:06.074
That's right.

01:01:06.094 --> 01:01:07.596
Yeah, yeah.

01:01:07.829 --> 01:01:17.161
prompting some kind of a... As long as you've been doing this, you know, and you're a highlight.

01:01:17.181 --> 01:01:19.905
I'm the only person who I've ever written for every issue, by the way.

01:01:19.965 --> 01:01:21.607
I was in every issue.

01:01:22.348 --> 01:01:33.803
You're going to like this new book, because a lot of those articles... Yeah, well, let me do a little bit, because I've done some things, you know, I've done those things, but I know Dime.

01:01:34.289 --> 01:01:43.363
And I used to say to him at first, I said, you know, Mabel, I don't know whether... I practically carried on my back the cases, the books.

01:01:44.224 --> 01:01:46.948
If you don't do it that way, don't do it at all.

01:01:46.968 --> 01:01:51.916
All that mattered gave me the backing mentally.

01:01:52.297 --> 01:01:58.186
For example, what I'm writing now, and I said, you know, this is awfully hard.

01:01:58.626 --> 01:02:01.731
It's not going to be a necessary piece, but it's going to be...

01:02:02.268 --> 01:02:03.690
Do you mind if I contact you later?

01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:05.452
I'd love to come back and see you.

01:02:05.652 --> 01:02:07.995
I hope Sam would help me get in touch.

01:02:08.315 --> 01:02:12.800
I'd like to come back and spend some time with you and you do this properly.

01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:13.782
I'd like to write about you.

01:02:13.802 --> 01:02:20.670
I'll tell you when I started, you know, back at the time of... You turned off the light bulb?

01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:24.995
Yes, you went to... She is living with books.

01:02:25.836 --> 01:02:27.057
You're living with more than books.

01:02:27.077 --> 01:02:27.978
You're living with history.

01:02:27.998 --> 01:02:28.659
You're living with art.

01:02:28.719 --> 01:02:31.262
You're living with everything.

01:02:31.597 --> 01:02:39.448
It's like yesterday, to meet their people in the country, never mind anything, you've done at least a half a dozen out of my, well, I thought about a dozen.

01:02:39.729 --> 01:02:42.192
Well, in fact, half a dozen out of my, well, I thought about a dozen.

01:02:42.212 --> 01:02:43.955
Oh, pardon me, it's a hard situation.

01:02:44.696 --> 01:02:46.919
And before you know it, your life is gone.

01:02:46.939 --> 01:02:48.221
You have to like what you're doing.

01:02:49.483 --> 01:02:52.167
But you don't, that's the fun of it.

01:02:52.788 --> 01:02:57.575
But you did the Christopher Columbus little museum.

01:02:58.276 --> 01:03:01.300
And what I did was help them to restore.

01:03:01.364 --> 01:03:02.826
What is that?

01:03:05.088 --> 01:03:06.330
That's right off Madeira.

01:03:07.551 --> 01:03:08.873
Wow, wonderful.

01:03:08.973 --> 01:03:12.257
But it all has some kind of significance.

01:03:12.617 --> 01:03:13.858
What did you want them to say?

01:03:13.918 --> 01:03:24.030
I put some things in the... I was working on it because I put those books...

01:03:26.018 --> 01:03:27.000
You couldn't do old.

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:28.723
No, not yet.

01:03:28.783 --> 01:03:29.604
You're young yet.

01:03:29.624 --> 01:03:34.733
See, and when you learn about color printing and you read such beautiful, beautiful books.

01:03:35.474 --> 01:03:42.386
So I have all of those one special course of the color printing.

01:03:43.548 --> 01:03:45.732
Well, now, next time.

01:03:45.931 --> 01:03:47.593
These are the color printing books.

01:03:47.613 --> 01:03:48.994
To show the fore-edge books.

01:03:50.635 --> 01:03:51.977
You saw.

01:03:51.997 --> 01:03:54.759
I have to take, I've got the fore-edge here.

01:03:54.779 --> 01:03:56.301
I want to come, I want to come back.

01:03:56.481 --> 01:03:59.343
So on the next trip, there's something to look forward to the next time.

01:03:59.744 --> 01:04:07.411
And, uh, but, uh, I'll pick with one thing so that makes you be interested.

01:04:07.451 --> 01:04:08.052
I want to come back.

01:04:08.072 --> 01:04:09.593
To have the eyes to see.

01:04:09.613 --> 01:04:11.435
I want to come back.

01:04:12.296 --> 01:04:12.816
Now, Salvador, but a, um,

01:04:13.302 --> 01:04:15.225
party for them in an exhibition.

01:04:15.245 --> 01:04:18.569
What's the point of having eyes if you don't see?

01:04:19.270 --> 01:04:20.211
And that's the point.

01:04:20.952 --> 01:04:26.239
And many people used to the same things, but they really, everything.

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:32.407
Now I'm going to show you a special role.

01:04:32.427 --> 01:04:37.354
A Roman soccer player, I used it for these.

01:04:39.316 --> 01:04:42.921
And then I came across, it was Picasso's medal.

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:48.029
And I guess he used this as a form.

01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:50.916
Afterwards, he had it in a place in Spain.

01:04:51.978 --> 01:04:55.366
And this kind of mode would be cool.

01:04:55.386 --> 01:04:57.370
You know, these are the fun things.

01:04:58.753 --> 01:05:02.682
Can we have our last trip go to Europe?

01:05:03.286 --> 01:05:32.803
see this is where I was at from the start but that's Bartolo's because again the color printing you see I'm conscious of where they belong just really look like real fabulous that's a when you get around to it about color printing things

01:05:33.053 --> 01:05:38.765
Out here, I'm particularly interested in seeing the color printing, you see.

01:05:41.651 --> 01:05:44.737
Who was a very odd individual, four years old.

01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:48.885
She was eating chicken in the new book.

01:05:48.906 --> 01:05:50.228
No, in the first book, I'm sorry.

01:05:51.230 --> 01:05:52.092
Did you meet him?

01:05:52.173 --> 01:05:55.919
Oh, pardon me, but aren't you afraid that the sun is going to hurt some of these princes?

01:05:55.939 --> 01:05:57.261
No, I'm on to his museum.

01:05:57.281 --> 01:05:58.022
No, I haven't, no.

01:05:58.042 --> 01:05:59.704
Go out to his museum.

01:05:59.724 --> 01:06:00.005
Early.

01:06:00.085 --> 01:06:03.109
Well, this is Pennsylvania she's talking about.

01:06:03.210 --> 01:06:04.592
Oh, Pennsylvania, yeah.

01:06:04.612 --> 01:06:06.374
And, uh, something real.

01:06:06.955 --> 01:06:07.817
It's very interesting.

01:06:08.578 --> 01:06:13.205
If you're interested in learning something, if you see something new.

01:06:13.225 --> 01:06:14.607
Papillon, butterflies?

01:06:14.847 --> 01:06:17.010
Yeah, yeah.

01:06:17.030 --> 01:06:20.255
Congratulations, you should really be very proud.

01:06:20.576 --> 01:06:21.437
I guess I...

01:06:21.839 --> 01:06:22.721
I should.

01:06:22.981 --> 01:06:38.228
We found a very difficult thing, and I don't know why other people, the reading of writing is a very long kind of a thing, how the manuscripts, that we can identify,

01:06:38.410 --> 01:06:42.514
as having done by stencils instead of just being done by hand.

01:06:42.754 --> 01:06:45.677
So you have a mind that is so inquisitive.

01:06:45.997 --> 01:06:46.978
Yeah, that's the point.

01:06:46.998 --> 01:06:51.683
And you have to be careful because I'm writing and I want to get it done and do a research.

01:06:51.703 --> 01:06:52.483
That's the joy of this.

01:06:52.503 --> 01:06:52.984
Yeah, that's the joy.

01:06:53.004 --> 01:06:54.045
That's the joy of collecting.

01:06:54.365 --> 01:07:04.755
Yeah, that's, if you, if you talk to people to not to underestimate and have them do simple things, you know.

01:07:05.309 --> 01:07:15.445
And also to make them understand, they started to collect to something that had sort of an imprint of an artist or a good author.

01:07:16.006 --> 01:07:20.693
That's going to be... It's Dutch Gaelic.

01:07:20.713 --> 01:07:22.356
It was the first word here.

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:26.364
And I wanted to see this special event, and he said, fine.

01:07:26.705 --> 01:07:36.656
He took me out, and it was an open space, like, things were, every one of the books were, was a new book, had to do with cowboys or Indians.

01:07:36.676 --> 01:07:38.118
But this is the focus out here.

01:07:38.158 --> 01:07:46.167
Yeah, but that, but the point is this, at first I was a little, and I said, you know what, I said,

01:07:46.653 --> 01:08:04.019
And someday, I who's foolish, or you that's foolish, or Sam that's foolish, if you think that you only have to get things out of the past, relate to it, because as far as I'm concerned, 500 years is like nothing, but to me, it's the people.

01:08:04.961 --> 01:08:14.415
And I think of it that a fool like me, or an interested man like you, or the fact that they were lucky enough to have you, Sam,

01:08:14.682 --> 01:08:22.232
that we have all the little things that we attach to.

01:08:22.913 --> 01:08:24.515
And that's what's wonderful about it.

01:08:24.875 --> 01:08:26.578
But not a matter of smug.

01:08:26.958 --> 01:08:30.062
Some people make much to see an old book or something.

01:08:30.463 --> 01:08:39.795
But to me, the fact that I've attached myself to that, what he's been doing, now I have been calling all over

01:08:40.214 --> 01:08:48.052
The world documentation on certain artists, I refuse to finish that book unless I get their dates.

01:08:48.192 --> 01:08:49.194
Now, can I ask you a question?

01:08:49.234 --> 01:08:49.395
Yes.

01:08:49.816 --> 01:08:54.847
Do I have your permission for Sam to give me your telephone number and your address and how to get in touch with you?

01:08:55.689 --> 01:08:55.769
Yes.

01:08:56.190 --> 01:08:59.337
I certainly would never ask him without your permission.

01:08:59.755 --> 01:09:02.317
I mean, I'd love to get in touch with you.

01:09:02.337 --> 01:09:05.420
Sam looks like low-key.

01:09:05.961 --> 01:09:07.242
He looks like low-key.

01:09:07.322 --> 01:09:09.965
But he's very excited of everything you have done.

01:09:10.005 --> 01:09:11.806
But no, really.

01:09:12.847 --> 01:09:14.128
I feel good.

01:09:14.148 --> 01:09:15.430
I found your publication.

01:09:15.470 --> 01:09:18.292
It wasn't something that was around.

01:09:18.693 --> 01:09:20.074
I thought about it yesterday.

01:09:20.134 --> 01:09:22.897
I thought, how did I find your publication?

01:09:23.057 --> 01:09:27.501
Speaking to James Tannis, and I said, James, you know about it.

01:09:28.139 --> 01:09:28.480
Yeah.

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:30.703
It wasn't around that long, and then it just folded.

01:09:30.723 --> 01:09:30.783
No.

01:09:30.803 --> 01:09:34.149
But you haven't read my first book, Gentle Madness, yet?

01:09:34.169 --> 01:09:34.369
No.

01:09:34.650 --> 01:09:36.413
Well, we'll take care of that.

01:09:36.433 --> 01:09:37.374
I'm going to get some copies.

01:09:37.434 --> 01:09:40.820
In fact, I'll send some copies to you by mail.

01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:42.783
You don't have to worry about her getting a copy.

01:09:42.803 --> 01:09:50.136
It has been a pleasure for me, for Sam, to bring somebody here like yourself, and the fact that just to stimulate somebody.

01:09:50.636 --> 01:09:54.062
Now, when you go to speak, you're going to have to draw a diary.

01:09:54.262 --> 01:09:56.826
But on the other hand... Don't scare me.

01:09:56.906 --> 01:10:07.664
No, but on the other hand, if you realize that somebody has to start somewhere, and somebody has to document the things and just start them at some place, you know?

01:10:08.065 --> 01:10:12.672
So, you know, before us and after us.

01:10:15.958 --> 01:10:19.223
I did some of these shiny things.

01:10:19.405 --> 01:10:26.314
But see, actually, a clergy, that isn't the word they use, but he was out of the monastery.

01:10:26.574 --> 01:10:35.265
Because somebody must have backed him, the church must have backed him, all over doing things as far as... And who is he again?

01:10:35.285 --> 01:10:38.249
So I can check him out.

01:10:38.269 --> 01:10:39.951
I'll just read the description.

01:10:42.214 --> 01:10:43.936
So that's Kershler, K-I-I.

01:10:43.976 --> 01:10:46.399
You've got a Greek name, Athanasius.

01:10:46.419 --> 01:10:47.320
Yeah.

01:10:47.502 --> 01:11:01.680
The first illustrated account of China with sections on Japan and India, Kersher, K-I-R-C-H-E-R, was a Jesuit polymath who also wrote an Egyptian hieroglyphics, astronomy, plants in China.

01:11:02.181 --> 01:11:06.166
Are these descriptions from some of your exhibitions?

01:11:06.246 --> 01:11:07.407
Are these descriptions?

01:11:08.449 --> 01:11:11.873
I don't know how to put that back, so I'm just going to leave that there.

01:11:12.747 --> 01:11:17.661
Well, Sam, maybe we ought to be getting going.
