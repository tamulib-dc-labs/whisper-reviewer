WEBVTT

00:04.385 --> 00:20.283
Is it, do you think, just a coincidence, that the last three novels, one has been historical, one has played on a tragedy, and now we have a comedy?

00:20.323 --> 00:29.794
I mean, are we doing a real considerable bow towards Mr. Shakespeare, or at his fifth day of a week or a half ago?

00:30.415 --> 00:32.097
No, but the...

00:32.684 --> 00:36.207
The Greenlanders, I consider it an epic.

00:36.227 --> 00:42.554
So it's not Shakespearean, but I did want to try all the major forms.

00:42.814 --> 00:45.837
So I tried an epic, then a tragedy, then a comedy.

00:45.937 --> 00:48.499
So I am on track at least a tad here.

00:49.300 --> 00:53.664
Not the next one, but at some point I'll try and do a Romeo.

00:54.185 --> 00:56.127
Maybe you should try and do a novel in sonnets.

00:56.667 --> 00:56.787
Oh.

00:58.489 --> 01:02.173
Remember, Vikram Seth, his first novel was entirely in sonnets.

01:02.193 --> 01:02.573
It was?

01:02.755 --> 01:10.843
Tell me, I mean, this obviously must be quite a fascination with Shakespeare.

01:10.863 --> 01:14.206
It really is resonating to a good deal of your work.

01:15.447 --> 01:24.076
Well, it was only A Thousand Acres that was consciously based on Shakespeare.

01:26.799 --> 01:31.243
Moo, I just intended to be a comedy, but I guess I...

01:32.303 --> 01:36.750
learned most of what I know about what a comedy is when I took Shakespeare.

01:36.770 --> 01:45.303
So that has been just a sort of hidden influence rather than a conscious influence.

01:45.744 --> 01:47.126
I agree with Alison Lurie.

01:47.146 --> 01:59.004
I mean, the good giveaway is to end with the weddings, you know, which is so characteristic of all the Shakespeare product qualities.

01:59.125 --> 02:00.707
With that conscious device,

02:00.839 --> 02:02.942
that you worked into?

02:02.962 --> 02:05.325
Yes, I knew I wanted to end with weddings.

02:06.486 --> 02:12.874
And I just wanted it to be recognizably comic.

02:14.296 --> 02:29.715
When you're creating a comic novel like this, and certainly to follow one that was just 180 degrees in the other direction, creatively, I mean,

02:30.320 --> 02:45.960
Well, I don't think it shocks people who have read a lot of my work other than A Thousand Acres, because I always did.

02:47.542 --> 02:59.297
I don't think this Moo is any more different from A Thousand Acres than, let's say, the Greenlanders was from Duplicate Keys, you know.

02:59.615 --> 03:05.223
It's just, I like to try different things.

03:05.243 --> 03:17.781
And I had intended to write both a tragedy and a comedy on the same theme, you know, the theme of American agriculture.

03:19.042 --> 03:22.247
And so I conceived of them at about the same time.

03:22.928 --> 03:26.533
And as I was researching A Thousand Acres,

03:26.952 --> 03:29.095
I was thinking also about moods.

03:29.115 --> 03:33.981
Yeah, so this was in your mind when you... Mm-hmm.

03:34.001 --> 03:36.224
And was this novel germinating?

03:36.245 --> 03:37.146
Oh, more or less.

03:37.266 --> 03:51.225
I mean, I was noting things in my research that might be interesting, and I was... People were talking to me, and I was thinking about what they had to say.

03:52.346 --> 03:56.672
So I wasn't actually writing notes or planning or anything, but...

03:57.496 --> 04:01.099
I knew that it was next.

04:01.120 --> 04:04.943
I read someplace where you mentioned research.

04:05.023 --> 04:10.549
I mean, you really did almost go out and become an anthropologist to some degree, didn't you?

04:10.569 --> 04:14.833
I mean, you really went out and entered the lives of a farmer.

04:14.853 --> 04:18.897
Well, I did, in a way, though less than appears on the surface.

04:18.977 --> 04:27.385
I mean, I talked to a lot of people, and I read the Des Moines Register a lot, and I read a lot of books.

04:29.120 --> 04:45.184
And then when I had written most of 1,000 acres, I found people who were knowledgeable about farming and had them read the manuscripts and tell me what was right and what was wrong.

04:46.706 --> 04:49.691
So yes, I did research, but I don't think of that.

04:49.991 --> 04:58.384
I think of that as just interesting reading, you know, reading something that I'm interested in more than,

04:58.769 --> 05:02.533
you know, toiling away at the library or anything like that.

05:02.553 --> 05:04.294
Do you see these two as a pair, then?

05:04.414 --> 05:05.555
Oh, yeah.

05:05.575 --> 05:06.997
Very much.

05:07.017 --> 05:09.139
I hope they're in a slipcase someday.

05:09.279 --> 05:14.043
Well, I'd love to ask you to describe those two to me, and then the bottom one is from my editor at Hope.

05:14.464 --> 05:15.525
Oh, great.

05:15.545 --> 05:17.066
Who's a great fan of yours.

05:17.086 --> 05:18.868
Alan Peacock, actually.

05:19.729 --> 05:20.169
Oh, thanks.

05:20.209 --> 05:26.635
I told him when I said to be interviewing you, Jason Lee, give me a song.

05:26.655 --> 05:26.916
Oh, sure.

05:26.936 --> 05:28.337
He's Bob Butler, his editor.

05:29.448 --> 05:30.710
You mentioned Des Moines.

05:30.730 --> 05:33.433
Do you remember Steven Blumberg, the book Thief?

05:33.954 --> 05:35.496
Yes, sir.

05:35.596 --> 05:36.958
I was at that trial.

05:37.158 --> 05:38.039
He's in my book.

05:38.139 --> 05:39.621
I wrote a book about bibliomania.

05:40.062 --> 05:40.703
Oh, is that right?

05:41.644 --> 05:43.486
And I've got a major chapter.

05:44.187 --> 05:47.351
He must be the biggest bibliomanian ever, right?

05:47.552 --> 05:50.996
Well, bibliocleptomaniac is what he is.

05:51.056 --> 05:53.599
He's the biggest one in the 20th century by far.

05:53.619 --> 05:56.383
He's my example of excess.

05:57.730 --> 06:00.933
person who goes over the cliff when he comes back.

06:00.953 --> 06:02.815
Yeah, that seems an interesting case.

06:03.436 --> 06:10.143
Well, the great thing about him is that he stole the stuff to keep it.

06:10.304 --> 06:12.626
Rather than to sell it, yeah.

06:12.646 --> 06:14.388
I mean, there was no profit or anything.

06:14.408 --> 06:16.971
He kept putting a collection together in a tumble.

06:16.991 --> 06:21.175
And I went, and his house was in all these shelves.

06:21.195 --> 06:22.577
Really weird, weird case.

06:22.597 --> 06:23.658
Really amazing.

06:23.678 --> 06:23.838
Yeah.

06:24.239 --> 06:26.421
His defense was insanity, if you can believe it.

06:26.857 --> 06:29.000
And he should have won.

06:29.160 --> 06:36.551
Anyway, you don't want to hear about this, but you mentioned Des Moines.

06:36.671 --> 06:43.681
How do you respond to Lurie's suggestion that you're the Balzac of the American Midwest?

06:44.242 --> 06:48.848
Well, you know, that's an interesting thing because just a few months ago I said,

06:49.756 --> 06:52.179
to somebody, have you ever read any Balzac?

06:53.681 --> 06:55.183
And they said, oh, a long time ago.

06:55.203 --> 06:56.785
And I said, well, I never have, I should.

06:57.566 --> 07:08.560
And so I was kind of, I'd read some kind of, I don't know, article or review of Balzac in which they were talking about what a wonderful writer he was.

07:08.580 --> 07:10.403
And I thought, gee, I should read some of that.

07:10.423 --> 07:13.907
But I'm not very knowledgeable about French literature stuff.

07:14.528 --> 07:16.710
I had never read any, and I haven't yet.

07:16.951 --> 07:21.716
You should read this recent biography.

07:21.736 --> 07:22.937
It's absolutely spectacular.

07:22.997 --> 07:24.639
My wife got it.

07:25.480 --> 07:27.322
Maybe it was a review of that.

07:27.342 --> 07:27.703
Yeah, it was.

07:27.723 --> 07:30.326
It was one of the New York Times' ten notable books.

07:30.346 --> 07:32.248
It's a really wonderful book.

07:32.268 --> 07:41.919
Well, I should read some, but I'm not a very fast reader, so between student work and review books and stuff like that.

07:42.359 --> 07:44.181
Is this, in your mind,

07:44.532 --> 07:45.754
A satire?

07:47.216 --> 07:50.140
Well, it's a comic, satiric novel.

07:50.501 --> 07:56.931
I think of Fielding, you know, comico-satirico-ethical novel.

07:57.071 --> 08:01.778
I want it to be both satirical and comic.

08:01.798 --> 08:08.548
And as a satirical novel, then, what is the target, in your view, of your satire?

08:10.790 --> 08:22.968
Oh, a certain attitude of this, I think, typically American, that, you know, if we know a little technique about something and then apply it, it'll be great.

08:25.532 --> 08:38.451
You know, the difference between maybe technique and knowledge, you know, everybody, every technique is successful, essentially, you know, but people who

08:39.038 --> 08:49.491
knew the technique of the frontal lobotomy were totally successful in removing the frontal lobe, but they didn't know anything about what that was gonna do.

08:49.631 --> 09:06.852
So that's fascinating because the land grant university in general has been very technically oriented and has applied a lot of techniques without thinking through in a very clear way what

09:07.574 --> 09:35.927
those techniques were going to mean over the long run so it's i'm not targeting at any particular university it's just uh i'm interested in a whole way of thinking about now did you read by its possession i'm wondering and that almost is a satire academic question

09:37.628 --> 09:38.809
I don't remember.

09:38.849 --> 09:52.943
This passion was just to get all these manuscripts and the writing involved, but you really, it is a very, your book is really a funny look at the academic community.

09:52.964 --> 09:54.705
Well, that's what I wanted to do.

09:54.725 --> 10:07.298
I mean, I think it's a temptation for every comic writer to try and be as funny as possible, and so you can't resist

10:09.100 --> 10:36.002
being funny if you possibly can i mean did you have this just wonderful uh pig in mind right from the beginning really yeah i didn't know exactly why or what i was going to do with him but um one of the first things anybody uh one of the first things i ever heard that sort of put me on this track

10:36.792 --> 10:43.399
Or somebody said, or I read somewhere, that no hog had ever lived out its natural lifespan.

10:45.141 --> 10:47.804
And I thought that was fascinating.

10:48.524 --> 10:57.994
And of course it would be true because hogs don't have any real usefulness except being consumed.

10:58.034 --> 11:05.162
They aren't like horses or llamas or... Right, or even dogs or cats.

11:05.564 --> 11:09.670
Except truffle hogs, I guess, they don't function.

11:11.012 --> 11:23.332
And yet they're very intelligent and they have a kind of, I don't know, charm.

11:24.734 --> 11:28.459
So that fascinated me, the idea.

11:28.620 --> 11:33.327
I'm sure there are hogs that have lived out their natural lives there, but I had never

11:33.897 --> 11:41.529
I heard this, but this hasn't been... But that would be almost an Iowa kind of thing, wouldn't it?

11:42.731 --> 11:44.674
I mean, I mean, we'd have to even consider that.

11:45.656 --> 12:01.120
And then I asked somebody, I asked some of my people I knew who had had hogs or who knew hogs, what their lifespan was on the farm, even if they were used for breeding, and they were all, it was all, you know,

12:01.336 --> 12:29.031
four to five years well that doesn't seem very long chicken can live that long and so i said well why what about will they keep growing and they said well yeah but there's a limit on the size of the boar because the sow can't support the boar past a certain weight during breeding so that's a reason to

12:29.838 --> 12:38.770
water the breeding boards, because if they get too big, they can't really breed anymore without hurting the staff.

12:38.790 --> 12:41.093
So I thought, well, that's interesting, too, you know?

12:41.353 --> 12:48.182
So all that stuff about hogs really fascinated me.

12:48.202 --> 12:49.263
And of course, it's funny.

12:50.024 --> 12:51.066
Yeah, it's funny.

12:51.146 --> 12:54.470
I mean, pig is funny.

12:54.490 --> 12:58.796
I mean, if you don't even know anything about the pig.

12:58.816 --> 12:59.136
Right.

12:59.352 --> 13:04.698
And did you realize that you'd actually be characterizing his pig to a degree?

13:04.718 --> 13:07.121
Yeah, I did.

13:07.141 --> 13:08.943
I knew he would have a point of view.

13:10.125 --> 13:14.089
And those chapters were fun to write.

13:14.109 --> 13:16.432
I'm just laughing.

13:16.452 --> 13:22.099
It's almost brazen, isn't it?

13:22.119 --> 13:29.207
Well, some of the first people I had read the book found it unacceptable.

13:29.558 --> 13:31.580
that the hog had a point of view.

13:32.361 --> 13:43.451
And... But, you know, I liked him and I thought, well, it certainly makes it different, you know, from other academic novels.

13:43.471 --> 13:49.496
So I just went ahead and, you know, did what I wanted to do.

13:49.516 --> 13:52.219
Would you say that this is a uniquely American novel?

13:53.420 --> 13:59.025
Well, sure, because that this whole idea of... This couldn't be written by any other kind of...

13:59.832 --> 14:13.511
I don't think so, because this whole idea of the land-grant university arose out of the settling of the Midwest and the West, especially the Midwest.

14:13.531 --> 14:21.822
So the first departments that they had were agronomy and engineering and HOMAC.

14:22.062 --> 14:29.012
Their idea was to teach the settlers how to more productively

14:29.633 --> 14:31.955
the land that they were settling.

14:32.316 --> 14:43.727
And the founding of the land-grant university is coterminous with that period of rapid settlement just after the Civil War.

14:43.747 --> 14:47.731
So I don't know.

14:47.751 --> 14:58.281
It's not—there's not another—no other country has a university tradition that's in any way like this.

14:58.381 --> 14:59.522
That's true.

15:00.228 --> 15:07.896
and setting up my syndicates to mindfully go after newspapers in cities where the State University's been.

15:07.916 --> 15:13.582
Because in many cases, there's nothing else for miles around, you know.

15:13.602 --> 15:16.305
What's Eugene going for, the State University?

15:17.045 --> 15:19.228
What's Lincoln going for, I guess?

15:19.308 --> 15:20.869
It's amazing.

15:20.909 --> 15:21.870
Astorias, Connecticut.

15:21.950 --> 15:29.458
It's just where they put this university, and they were all when they had... A lot of them are.

15:29.810 --> 15:39.961
In Oregon, Corvallis is the Wayne Grant University, but a lot of them that you don't expect to be Wayne Grant Universities like Berkeley are Wayne Grant Universities.

15:39.981 --> 15:42.703
Or Amherst in Massachusetts.

15:42.723 --> 15:47.649
This is hardly an agricultural state deal.

15:47.669 --> 15:53.775
There are more than you think there are, at least there are more than I thought there were, because I got

15:53.958 --> 15:56.961
of them out of the University of Wisconsin.

15:56.981 --> 16:02.887
I was pretty surprised at which ones were land-grant universities in some cases.

16:02.947 --> 16:09.573
Because you do see these as a pair, so then tell me, if you might, how it started.

16:09.713 --> 16:13.297
I think you're teaching certainly out in Iowa, but I don't think you were in Midwestern.

16:13.317 --> 16:15.018
Yes, I was raised in St.

16:15.038 --> 16:15.319
Louis.

16:15.699 --> 16:16.240
Oh, okay.

16:17.301 --> 16:19.343
But you were an Army brat, aren't you?

16:19.503 --> 16:22.986
No, my father was in the Army, but after

16:23.287 --> 16:25.229
after he and my mother got married.

16:25.249 --> 16:32.496
He was not so young, but they were divorced when I was very young, and I moved back.

16:32.696 --> 16:39.062
My mother moved back with my grandparents, and my grandparents lived in St.

16:39.222 --> 16:42.145
Louis, so I'm pretty Midwestern.

16:42.205 --> 16:50.793
Missouri isn't Midwestern in the same way that Iowa is or Illinois is.

16:51.894 --> 16:53.175
I don't think it's Southern.

16:53.662 --> 16:58.527
It's definitely a border state.

16:58.767 --> 17:01.470
So it's southern, and St.

17:01.630 --> 17:06.875
Louis is a very old city, so in a way it's even kind of eastern.

17:06.895 --> 17:07.275
Pardon me.

17:08.276 --> 17:21.630
You've done quite an impressive—you have quite an impressive body of work, and I think one of the very remarkable aspects of it is a variety of things that you've done.

17:21.650 --> 17:21.930
Oh, thank you.

17:22.231 --> 17:40.997
Well, I get bored with doing the same thing over and over again.

17:41.017 --> 17:44.382
I have a real horror of doing the same thing over and over again.

17:44.542 --> 17:52.153
In fact, if I'm working on an idea and I realize there's something in it that I've done before, I sort of

17:54.395 --> 17:55.276
and panic.

17:56.638 --> 18:05.929
And I don't know why that is, but I just, in that way, and I like novelty.

18:06.170 --> 18:23.271
I also think that every person reads different forms, so all the forms must appeal to something different in each person.

18:23.909 --> 18:25.392
You're talking about the readers now.

18:25.412 --> 18:25.873
Right.

18:25.893 --> 18:34.448
So I don't see why a writer, you know, every form must express a different side of each writer, too.

18:34.608 --> 18:42.282
So I guess that's what I feel that each of the forms that I'm working in expresses a different side.

18:42.482 --> 18:44.065
How about themes, though?

18:44.085 --> 18:46.510
I mean, a form's certainly different, but how about themes?

18:46.530 --> 18:47.892
Do you find a consistency?

18:50.032 --> 18:58.059
Well, I've always been interested in country life as opposed to city life, and even in Duplicate Keys, which takes place in New York City.

18:58.720 --> 19:10.570
The people live near Riverside Park, and they spend a lot of time about as close to nature as you can get in Manhattan.

19:13.092 --> 19:18.317
I just don't particularly care for urban life, and I don't know much about it.

19:19.782 --> 19:32.323
I don't want to live in urban life, so... You say you've got somebody calling at 2.30.

19:32.363 --> 19:33.264
That's okay.

19:33.284 --> 19:35.147
We can go all the way until they call.

19:35.288 --> 19:37.331
We aren't necessarily going to be on time.

19:41.157 --> 19:45.925
And you are interested, of course, in relationships and families?

19:48.605 --> 19:55.433
I think I mentioned earlier that this is an American novel.

19:55.453 --> 20:04.304
Do you see yourself as writing an affinity for an American tradition?

20:04.425 --> 20:10.332
Why does it really have an affinity for place?

20:10.352 --> 20:15.338
Well, I do feel that I have an affinity for place in the sense that

20:16.634 --> 20:24.742
I can't really start, or I don't usually start writing until I know where it's set and what that place is like.

20:24.963 --> 20:29.728
And that gives me a lot of energy.

20:33.532 --> 20:43.502
But actually, you know, my favorite writers that I read are not traditional American writers.

20:45.170 --> 20:55.047
Well-educated in British and Russian and Scandinavian writers, so... Could you give me a couple of examples of who you read for pleasure?

20:55.067 --> 20:58.272
Oh, Dickens and George Eliot.

20:58.292 --> 21:00.195
So the 19th century ones?

21:00.576 --> 21:01.938
Mm-hmm.

21:01.958 --> 21:05.384
And Gokul.

21:05.404 --> 21:10.873
And, for example, I'm very poorly read in Hemingway and Faulkner.

21:12.355 --> 21:42.210
just american literature in general yeah so contemporary writers well i i yeah i know i read a lot of contemporary writers like sue miller and russell banks and jamaica kincai um and i especially like caribbean women writers and so i'm i'm pretty well read or i'm a slow reader as i said but i'm pretty well read in modern american writers but

21:44.114 --> 21:46.436
But not in the older one.

21:46.456 --> 21:48.538
I just got a curiosity when you say slow reader.

21:50.640 --> 21:51.922
How many pages in an hour?

21:52.022 --> 21:54.304
I'm just curious if you have the right piece.

21:56.246 --> 21:59.589
Well, it depends on the book, but maybe about 30.

21:59.809 --> 22:01.851
30 slow?

22:03.853 --> 22:08.578
When you read books, as I do, you know, for a living, I mean, you have to even time yourself.

22:08.598 --> 22:13.142
I mean, I've got to be doing 100 pages in an hour, you know, and I'll never do that.

22:13.162 --> 22:13.603
Oh, no.

22:13.623 --> 22:14.003
I'll never do that.

22:14.827 --> 22:16.970
And I have to read a lot of student work.

22:18.693 --> 22:38.703
I teach a course in graduate fiction writing, and the students have to write and discuss a draft a week, so that's generally about, I have 12 students, that's about 400 pages a week right there.

22:40.005 --> 22:43.450
So in manuscript pages, I can go faster than,

22:44.459 --> 22:54.410
I'm not a very fast reader, and I have, you know, a family, and a little boy is two, so.

22:54.470 --> 23:00.517
So he doesn't go to bed until 10 o'clock, so there's no reading until he goes to bed.

23:00.537 --> 23:05.422
You really seem to get passionate about your subjects.

23:05.542 --> 23:05.903
You really do.

23:08.205 --> 23:13.251
You immerse yourself, it seems, in your writing.

23:15.003 --> 23:16.805
Did you have fun writing, Lou?

23:18.126 --> 23:18.406
Oh, yeah.

23:18.426 --> 23:20.368
How about fun writing thousands of days?

23:21.008 --> 23:22.270
That wouldn't have been fun.

23:22.290 --> 23:23.931
No, that wouldn't have been fun.

23:23.991 --> 23:26.033
That wouldn't have been fun.

23:26.053 --> 23:32.339
And if you don't mind my even asking questions about that, because you do see them together.

23:32.819 --> 23:37.303
I did get a thousand words in a piece, so I can cover it like that.

23:39.145 --> 23:45.010
You did kind of turn the tables on NOI for one from making

23:45.563 --> 24:02.548
I know you've commented about it, but I wonder if you could comment to me about it, how that came to pass and how you felt justified really tinkering with Shakespeare.

24:03.089 --> 24:07.896
Actually, you've even said that you really don't think you tinkered with Shakespeare.

24:07.916 --> 24:12.803
Well, I think that I took a situation that had been presented

24:13.289 --> 24:18.855
from one angle and kind of turned it 90 degrees and presented it from another angle.

24:19.396 --> 24:28.827
I always felt that the older sisters had some kind of point of view in the play.

24:29.127 --> 24:30.709
They were purely evil.

24:30.729 --> 24:34.854
Well, Lear characterized them as purely evil.

24:35.615 --> 24:37.657
I mean, in your view.

24:37.677 --> 24:41.642
But, you know, I don't characterize anybody as purely evil.

24:41.926 --> 24:49.612
In our day and age, we looked for other kinds of motivation besides just pure evil.

24:52.035 --> 25:00.101
And so I was looking for some other motivation, and I decided maybe anger was the motivation.

25:02.483 --> 25:11.511
But if you looked at them as deeply angry, then you had to look at their history

25:11.845 --> 25:14.970
You had to look at what had made them so angry.

25:15.390 --> 25:31.976
It was interesting in the play that Lear always acts from the beginning of the play as if there's no past, as if everything starts today.

25:32.617 --> 25:39.928
And the biggest, the greatest sign of that is that he doesn't consult

25:40.330 --> 25:44.757
his knowledge of whether his daughters love him or not.

25:45.157 --> 25:48.322
He just gives them this test today.

25:49.444 --> 26:06.149
And this goes, this stands for every, this, or not, doesn't stand for it, but it kind of relegates all their history together to the dustbin, you know.

26:07.330 --> 26:09.814
And that fascinated me that he would,

26:10.688 --> 26:16.176
he would not acknowledge there having been a history.

26:17.618 --> 26:20.122
And I hadn't thought about that too much.

26:20.182 --> 26:36.886
I thought about it a little bit, but then when I saw Kurosawa's movie, Ron, one of the sons, the daughters were changed into sons, and one of the sons says to the father early in the movie, what we are, you made of.

26:37.767 --> 26:39.750
And I thought, well, obviously that's true.

26:40.473 --> 26:48.482
And that would apply to daughters as well as sons if you went back and looked at King Lear again.

26:48.502 --> 26:53.748
So all those thoughts sort of gestated together.

26:56.711 --> 26:59.254
What are you working on now?

26:59.474 --> 27:04.620
This is three years, I guess, four years between the books?

27:04.760 --> 27:09.585
Well, it's been three and a half years since the thousand acres.

27:10.021 --> 27:23.402
Yeah, I had another novella that I was interested in publishing, but the publisher said no, he wanted a novel, so he went home and wrote a novel.

27:25.325 --> 27:29.131
But I don't think it'll be that long now, until the next one, maybe two years.

27:30.192 --> 27:32.536
You said it will be another novel, I'm sorry.

27:32.556 --> 27:35.100
Yeah, it'll probably be a novel, a little shorter.

27:36.397 --> 27:39.721
again another exploration of form for you?

27:39.781 --> 27:40.022
No.

27:40.823 --> 27:43.045
Oh, yeah, another exploration of form.

27:43.206 --> 27:45.449
I thought you said another exploration of farming.

27:45.789 --> 27:50.735
No more about agriculture for the time being.

27:50.755 --> 27:53.499
But you've had fun with it.

27:53.519 --> 27:55.081
Yeah, it's been great.

27:55.521 --> 27:56.463
It's a good subject.

27:56.523 --> 27:57.804
More people should do it.

27:58.005 --> 28:03.872
I mean, the thing I noticed about I reviewed a novel called

28:05.337 --> 28:17.309
In the Place of Fallen Leaves by Tim Pears, a British writer, for the Washington Post earlier this year.

28:17.329 --> 28:19.732
And it was a wonderful novel.

28:19.752 --> 28:21.734
I gave it a good to hear.

28:21.814 --> 28:32.965
And the thing I noticed about it was that it just brought so many great ideas into contemporary English literature, which is entirely urban, you know.

28:34.885 --> 28:37.428
You have to get out into the country sometimes.

28:37.468 --> 28:43.915
There are wonderful primal dramas taking place in the country.

28:43.935 --> 28:59.092
The country is a source of great emotion and great spirituality and also great thoughts.

28:59.112 --> 29:02.496
And if you don't, your literature or your writers

29:03.235 --> 29:13.526
you know, never get out, never get past suburbia, then they don't get, then none of these forces ever get into their work, and that's what I like.

29:13.546 --> 29:19.211
I have to say, I'm delighted to be interviewing a mid-question writer.

29:19.231 --> 29:19.452
Okay.

29:19.472 --> 29:21.934
Again, it's just the way it's been lately.

29:21.954 --> 29:26.879
I've even been doing a lot of East Coast writers and a lot of English writers, you know.

29:26.899 --> 29:27.320
Oh, yeah.

29:27.340 --> 29:30.643
So it's really great to have that.

29:30.663 --> 29:32.365
And, of course, I'd be glad to be with you here.

29:32.598 --> 29:34.421
I don't really question you about the book.

29:34.441 --> 29:37.986
That's my job, to read them and to make a comment.

29:38.007 --> 29:41.412
It's kind of foolish to ask you which headline you have.

29:41.632 --> 29:42.854
Sure, that's fine.

29:42.874 --> 29:43.916
But I'm supposed to do that.

29:44.477 --> 29:53.571
I really am not going to take up too much of your time.

29:53.691 --> 29:54.072
It's fine.

29:54.092 --> 29:56.536
I didn't have to do with Nadine Goymo.

29:56.556 --> 29:59.280
She was up there doing some lectures at Harvard last fall.

30:00.053 --> 30:01.755
And she made a very interesting comment.

30:01.815 --> 30:05.299
She said, you know, because her body of work is enormous.

30:05.679 --> 30:10.664
But she felt that everything, the metaphor was a statue, a piece of sculpture.

30:11.485 --> 30:22.437
And so going into the room, and it's one sculpture, but every book is kind of walking around and looking at the same piece from a different angle, that it really is all part of one piece.

30:22.457 --> 30:24.219
And I wonder, do you agree with that?

30:24.279 --> 30:28.704
Or would you suggest that your work would, would you see your work similarly?

30:28.844 --> 30:29.605
No, I wouldn't.

30:29.770 --> 30:51.877
I would look at it as a different... She's walking around one thing and looking at it from different angles, but I feel more like I'm in... I am in a spot, and I'm turning and looking at different things, looking outward rather than looking at something.

30:52.057 --> 30:58.225
But nevertheless, you do certainly see this as a body of work that you're creating.

30:58.492 --> 30:59.433
book after book.

30:59.453 --> 31:01.395
Yeah, it'll shape up to do that.

31:01.535 --> 31:03.476
You're having fun.

31:03.576 --> 31:06.539
Whether it's your survey.

31:06.559 --> 31:06.819
Yeah.

31:06.839 --> 31:07.480
You enjoy this.

31:07.500 --> 31:08.921
This is not mission so much.

31:09.001 --> 31:09.982
You enjoy it.

31:11.463 --> 31:13.806
Do you feel a sense of mission in writing?

31:14.546 --> 31:15.627
It depends on the book.

31:16.308 --> 31:27.958
I mean, I don't feel it in particular in general, but if I'm writing, I think all of my books have a political viewpoint

31:28.377 --> 31:35.384
And they're all engaged with the world and they want the world.

31:35.504 --> 31:47.756
You know, Russell Banks, in one of his books, he wrote, go my book and destroy the world as it is.

31:47.776 --> 31:54.023
You know, I think there are a lot of writers who would say that that applies to them, too.

31:54.043 --> 31:56.545
I'm going to wrap it up.

31:57.014 --> 31:59.891
if that's okay with you, lots of stuff.

31:59.951 --> 32:01.641
And could you do me the others?
