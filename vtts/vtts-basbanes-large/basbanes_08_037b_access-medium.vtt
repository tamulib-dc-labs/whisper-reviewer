00:02.528 --> 00:14.546
That's a real difficult... I really didn't think of the book like that.

00:14.606 --> 00:16.109
I mean, again, the book is what it is.

00:16.169 --> 00:21.637
If it's commercial, so be it.

00:25.022 --> 00:26.104
That's fine with me.

00:26.544 --> 00:27.706
I don't have a problem with it.

00:29.429 --> 00:30.190
Literary?

00:30.828 --> 00:32.430
I've been told that's what it is.

00:32.450 --> 00:39.180
And I have no problem with that either.

00:39.240 --> 00:48.212
I mean, I think that's quite flattering to be told that it's literary.

00:49.534 --> 00:56.044
I think that the reader... I mean, I could say this just looking at the book now.

00:56.304 --> 00:59.248
I mean, I think that the reader...

01:00.258 --> 01:10.333
needs to bring something to the table, needs to bring something to the party in order to fully appreciate this book.

01:11.575 --> 01:24.595
And indeed the book was written to encourage the reader to bring and

01:24.912 --> 01:49.620
his own sensibility, his own values, his own belief systems, his own sense of humor, whatever the reader has, his own prejudices and biases, his or her own sensitivity, whatever the reader has to bring to the table, the book was written to

01:50.950 --> 01:51.952
allow for that.

01:52.292 --> 01:54.596
This book is not a seamless book.

01:54.616 --> 01:56.018
This book is full of seams.

01:57.360 --> 02:06.374
It's a book of entries and of segments and sections, what I call analects, A-N-A-L-E-C-T-S.

02:07.896 --> 02:17.110
And it's that lack of connective tissue that I want the reader

02:17.343 --> 02:19.086
to provide him or herself.

02:19.166 --> 02:22.531
The reader can provide the connective tissue of this book.

02:24.113 --> 02:46.405
Ideally, it would be my hope that if, just to pick a number at random, I had 100 different readers, that each one of those 100 different readers would have a wildly varied reaction to this book and to John Brown.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.029
That would please me no end.

02:49.249 --> 02:57.178
Does John Brown mean an enigma for you, or is it very explained and satisfactorily, at least for yourself?

02:57.198 --> 02:58.479
An enigma.

02:58.499 --> 03:00.141
Or is that relevant?

03:00.161 --> 03:02.043
An enigma wrapped inside a conundrum.

03:02.764 --> 03:08.170
Is he an enigma?

03:08.250 --> 03:10.012
I mean... Was he ever an enigma?

03:10.032 --> 03:11.133
He must have been.

03:11.153 --> 03:12.915
Something puzzling about him in the tragedy.

03:18.920 --> 03:29.251
I mean, my initial response is to want to say we're all enigmas, which is kind of a cop-out answer.

03:33.956 --> 03:38.501
He's much less of an enigma to me now, of course, than he was before.

03:38.521 --> 03:42.726
Hopefully, after people are through reading this, he will not remain an enigma to them.

03:42.786 --> 03:48.572
But there's nothing wrong either with the reader feeling

03:49.244 --> 03:55.554
after having read the book, that he is in some part enigmatic and ought to remain so.

03:55.614 --> 04:06.852
I don't think that fiction ought to go around taking events or personalities that are essentially enigmatic and attempt to explain them.

04:07.412 --> 04:10.197
I think you've answered these questions.

04:10.217 --> 04:11.399
We can probably wrap it up on this one.

04:11.419 --> 04:12.260
There are tons of stuff here.

04:12.380 --> 04:13.482
It's all good stuff.

04:13.502 --> 04:16.787
I think, I'm sure you addressed yourself to it earlier, but...

04:17.206 --> 04:22.774
just to clarify once more, is for the reader.

04:23.415 --> 04:30.745
The reader is about to be introduced to John Brown as a fictional character and not as a historical figure.

04:30.765 --> 04:35.311
And I think you also say there's a lot of Bruce Olds in the John Brown movie here.

04:35.331 --> 04:36.874
Is that a fair statement?

04:36.894 --> 04:37.434
Yes, it is.

04:37.454 --> 04:41.500
But it's not fair to say that... This is your John Brown.

04:42.101 --> 04:43.042
Yeah.

04:43.222 --> 04:43.863
I hope so.

04:44.404 --> 04:46.487
I hope that... That was my intention.

04:47.176 --> 04:49.700
to make this my John Brown.

04:50.521 --> 05:16.339
That's not to say, again, I identified those three threads, that's not to say that in a very broad and general way that the parameters of this story, the chronology for the most part, the settings for the most part are historically

05:17.399 --> 05:19.021
accurate.

05:19.041 --> 05:35.880
The general arc, let's put it this way, the general arc of the book and the general arc of the man are pretty close to the historical bone, but just let me give you an example to clarify this for you, if I can, real quickly.

05:42.608 --> 05:45.111
This is the funeral

05:45.310 --> 05:46.611
procession scene.

05:46.811 --> 05:47.832
We're at the back of the book.

05:47.852 --> 05:49.114
What page number?

05:49.154 --> 05:49.894
Page 330.

05:50.835 --> 05:52.757
Okay.

05:53.698 --> 06:00.344
Mary bore his body north from Virginia, swollen with preservatives, and salted it down with lime.

06:01.105 --> 06:03.487
Well, Mary is a real person.

06:03.707 --> 06:04.388
That's his wife.

06:04.468 --> 06:05.809
I'm sure that's how they call it.

06:06.350 --> 06:08.632
She did bear him north from Virginia.

06:09.933 --> 06:11.114
Swollen with preservatives?

06:12.115 --> 06:12.255
Maybe.

06:12.696 --> 06:13.056
Me.

06:13.610 --> 06:15.392
Selted down with line me.

06:15.472 --> 06:18.895
The next sentence gives you a better example of what I'm talking about.

06:18.935 --> 06:38.593
The corpse lay inside an unsanded walnut plank coffin, its lid nailed shut beneath a canvas tarpollin, unfestuned by black crepe or bunting, and battened down with leather belts appropriated from a pair of book-crammed steamer trunks stored in the attic of the Harpers Ferry Public Library.

06:39.153 --> 06:39.674
Total invention.

06:40.835 --> 06:42.636
No, not really.

06:42.816 --> 06:43.397
Speculating.

06:43.951 --> 06:49.036
Well, for instance, I know for a fact that there was no Harper's Ferry Public Library.

06:52.059 --> 06:52.740
So why use it?

06:52.760 --> 06:53.421
Well, I made it up.

06:54.001 --> 06:54.161
Why?

06:54.942 --> 06:59.086
Because it fits in my mind as I was creating it.

06:59.106 --> 07:06.834
It was a very general story, but it felt good to have it be a public library.

07:08.736 --> 07:12.540
Which makes sense, because incidentally, there were no public libraries in 1849.

07:13.853 --> 07:16.576
This book... The first public library was... It's in my book.

07:16.596 --> 07:18.779
It was 1852 in Boston.

07:18.799 --> 07:21.623
You know, public library... There couldn't have been.

07:21.643 --> 07:25.668
Well, you noticed before, and you mentioned certain anachronisms in the book.

07:25.688 --> 07:26.709
That's the biggest one right there.

07:27.690 --> 07:29.693
Yeah, sure.

07:29.713 --> 07:31.435
The last line of the... But I never noticed it.

07:31.455 --> 07:39.485
The last line of the entire book, any errors of fact, as all sins of omission, are strictly my own and entirely premeditated.

07:39.565 --> 07:40.706
Premeditated.

07:40.726 --> 07:42.949
I... You know, that's not there to be flipped.

07:43.655 --> 07:45.757
That's there because I mean it.

07:45.918 --> 07:50.223
It's there because I mean it.

07:50.543 --> 07:51.785
And the anachronisms are there.

07:53.366 --> 07:55.369
They're premeditated.

07:55.389 --> 08:00.034
They're intentional.

08:00.755 --> 08:02.657
I know that these sorts of issues bother people.

08:02.898 --> 08:03.618
They bother people.

08:03.859 --> 08:09.806
It's like the whole... I mean, Caesar is called to the Senate by the ringing of a clock.

08:09.846 --> 08:12.929
Well, I mean, that's a thousand years before the invention of what?

08:12.949 --> 08:13.230
Right.

08:13.370 --> 08:13.510
Right.

08:14.063 --> 08:16.467
But it works within the body of the fiction.

08:16.647 --> 08:18.149
It works.

08:18.189 --> 08:23.798
These issues bother people, and I take those issues seriously.

08:24.078 --> 08:33.653
But it's like the furor and the controversy that was engendered by, to use a commercial, popular example, JFK, the movie by Oliver Stone.

08:34.454 --> 08:43.007
I mean, it's just outrage because this was messing or toying with history or fact or whatever.

08:43.375 --> 08:55.030
My own reaction to that movie as my reaction to works of fiction that do that, that mess, is... I don't care about things.

08:55.771 --> 08:57.654
Does it work as a film?

08:57.694 --> 08:58.855
Does it work as a novel?

08:58.895 --> 09:02.039
I think that you've got your disclaimer out of front.

09:02.240 --> 09:07.847
Oliver Stone, however, in that movie, actually offered that as a valid premise.

09:09.194 --> 09:14.802
In every interview that I saw with Oliver Stone, he said, this is my version of events.

09:14.822 --> 09:19.449
Yeah, but I mean, he wanted you to believe that it was a possible scenario.

09:20.791 --> 09:23.495
And he cited sources as documentation.

09:23.515 --> 09:30.846
So, I mean, I don't forgive him for what he did in that movie, but you absolutely made it very clear what you said there.

09:30.886 --> 09:32.789
And you've got it in print right there.

09:34.652 --> 09:36.134
I love Tim O'Brien's book.

09:36.715 --> 09:37.295
Lake of the Woods?

09:37.315 --> 09:38.357
Yeah, isn't that wonderful?

09:38.540 --> 09:40.583
I have not read it.

09:40.603 --> 09:41.284
No solution.

09:42.226 --> 09:43.788
I mean, it's just because we like mysteries.

09:46.212 --> 09:47.494
Listen, I think it's so funny.

09:47.574 --> 09:49.577
I'm going to drive back to Massachusetts tonight.

09:49.597 --> 09:49.717
Okay.

09:50.058 --> 09:52.562
Do you want my phone number in case you just need to ask me anything?

09:52.582 --> 09:53.664
I know that happens sometimes.

09:53.684 --> 09:54.645
Let's just put it in.

09:54.665 --> 09:55.647
I'll have it here.

09:56.168 --> 09:56.548
Okay.

09:57.710 --> 10:02.818
Okay.

10:02.838 --> 10:06.083
If you're going to get back to me, well, my home in Miami.

10:06.299 --> 10:11.266
Okay, it's 305-899-8053.

10:11.586 --> 10:18.155
I'm probably going to move this for the week following Labor Day.

10:18.816 --> 10:19.177
Okay.

10:19.217 --> 10:26.407
I've asked them, I'd be happy to move it within two weeks, but they really want the book.

10:26.787 --> 10:32.675
I'll be at that number as of next Monday.

10:33.616 --> 10:35.479
Okay.

10:41.467 --> 10:43.550
I would love to describe a couple of things.

10:43.570 --> 10:45.492
Just do that postmodern thing once more.

10:48.116 --> 10:49.037
Right.

10:49.598 --> 10:51.160
Okay, yeah.

10:51.180 --> 10:52.802
That's exactly what you said.

10:52.822 --> 11:05.358
When Alan saw the manuscript for the first time, he noted that there was a certain postmodern cast or color or texture or certain postmodern touches to the manuscript.

11:05.518 --> 11:09.263
And when he said that, when he noticed it,

11:09.395 --> 11:18.348
noted that I knew that I found an editor who understood the work and where I was coming from as a writer.

11:18.368 --> 11:37.917
Again, postmodern can mean a dozen things to a dozen different people, but what it means to me, the way I use the term, is simply that for me it means that one writes to an extent

11:38.285 --> 11:53.245
in violation of certain literary conventions, that one does not write within a tradition of realism or naturalism or romanticism, that one writes against those traditions to an extent.

11:53.285 --> 11:57.911
There's a certain against-ness about postmodernism.

11:57.931 --> 12:00.835
It's subversive to an extent.

12:01.496 --> 12:04.360
And in terms of mechanics,

12:04.778 --> 12:06.259
when you're writing.

12:07.060 --> 12:07.741
Let me just interject.

12:07.761 --> 12:07.981
Sure.

12:08.081 --> 12:11.064
You weren't thinking about this when you were writing.

12:11.084 --> 12:11.805
No, absolutely not.

12:11.825 --> 12:15.669
You did say that you did not want to be constrained by any accepted form of convention.

12:15.689 --> 12:15.849
Right.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.570
And that you really wanted to be free.

12:17.590 --> 12:19.572
To do what you wanted.

12:19.632 --> 12:20.173
Right.

12:20.593 --> 12:22.735
So that you can, if you wish.

12:22.755 --> 12:23.656
You don't literary critic.

12:23.897 --> 12:24.237
Oh, no.

12:24.277 --> 12:25.538
I mean, you know what?

12:25.658 --> 12:31.744
How can you write with an established aesthetic in mind?

12:32.505 --> 12:32.625
Right.

12:33.010 --> 13:00.553
would just be so it would seem to me so stifling and and and and wooden and artificial and contrived to do something like that but i just i did not feel constrained by convention uh and mechanically it means you can violate uh conventions of time and space and and narrative voice uh it means you can slip in and out of point of view uh it means you can ignore

13:01.411 --> 13:03.295
this, that, or the other thing if you feel like it.

13:03.516 --> 13:07.004
And the only test is, finally, does it work?

13:07.385 --> 13:11.113
Does it help the work succeed?

13:11.313 --> 13:11.955
So that's it.

13:12.035 --> 13:12.677
That's all.

13:12.697 --> 13:13.839
Great.

13:14.280 --> 13:14.661
Thank you.
