00:02.005 --> 00:31.253
You're talking about some of the obstacles that are in the way of getting a perfect... The unintended consequences and the things that people tend to overlook, even in a library like this, which is critically conscious of conservation and has been a supporter of conservation at its highest form, the most expensive form, for thirty years.

00:31.469 --> 00:34.012
you know, without any questions.

00:34.032 --> 00:39.920
They have, through Dr. Borstein, Mr. Mumford, and Dr. Burlington supported it, praised it.

00:40.741 --> 00:45.127
We, you know, you're here, you know, you're not someplace else.

00:45.147 --> 00:48.452
So anybody who they feel is important generally ends up coming here.

00:49.413 --> 00:56.562
But at the same time, there is probably a confusion about what it is we do.

00:56.642 --> 01:00.868
It's highly technical, sophisticated, craft-oriented stuff.

01:01.338 --> 01:08.569
So they don't necessarily always understand the arguments we're making against some of the technology that they're pushing.

01:09.250 --> 01:12.014
Yet it's a relatively happy marriage.

01:12.735 --> 01:18.944
Now, the person who supervises scanning and stuff, that's somebody else I'm going to see, right?

01:19.325 --> 01:20.947
That's the National Digital Library.

01:20.967 --> 01:21.548
Are you going there?

01:21.949 --> 01:22.730
Oh, yeah.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.432
I'm very interested in that.

01:24.612 --> 01:28.358
Well, we have connections with them because they have employed several positions here.

01:28.743 --> 01:33.389
funded several positions for the purpose of us preparing materials for them to digitize.

01:34.050 --> 01:43.542
And so there's been that recognition, but of course it's a recognition that indicates, one, the possibility of damage in the course of digitization.

01:43.562 --> 01:55.957
I think the figures we looked at, and I'll certainly check them again, but I think we're talking at maybe 10,000 items a year, 4,000 of this and 6,000 or something else, that you're able to do here in this unit.

01:55.977 --> 01:56.758
Is that about right?

01:59.152 --> 02:01.736
Yes, that's accurate, and it varies.

02:01.956 --> 02:08.606
You can do 10 books at 50 hours, but you can also do one book at 500 hours.

02:08.627 --> 02:11.210
It's the same amount of time, but you've got one book and you've got 10 books.

02:12.072 --> 02:16.038
So the numbers are difficult to correlate.

02:16.579 --> 02:20.004
So I guess it's the number of hours, working hours.

02:20.124 --> 02:22.628
How many hours have you got a year?

02:22.648 --> 02:27.235
I would say that the figure, and I'm just talking off the top of my head right now, is that we have...

02:28.683 --> 02:35.973
If we have twenty-five conservators... Let's do the math here.

02:36.033 --> 02:40.338
Twenty-five times... Well, I'm talking about a year.

02:40.398 --> 02:44.704
Seventeen hundred hours a year.

02:48.869 --> 02:51.653
Let's say 40,000 hours.

02:53.658 --> 02:57.163
So those are very precious hours, aren't they?

02:57.524 --> 02:58.826
You really have to decide.

02:59.307 --> 03:02.351
I mean, there really is a prioritization of material.

03:02.411 --> 03:04.534
Do you ever get material that comes in?

03:04.554 --> 03:10.143
Of course, you are dealing, I think you said at the beginning, fundamentally with what have been designated as rare books.

03:11.445 --> 03:18.896
So you're really not, we mentioned 117 made-items, but as a practical matter, you're not dealing with the general collections.

03:18.916 --> 03:20.779
So therefore, books that do come in here,

03:21.113 --> 03:24.976
They've never passed that point of no return, have they?

03:24.996 --> 03:29.440
Yeah, a book can be rare and still be in just abysmal shape.

03:29.520 --> 03:36.927
Yeah, but I mean, but by the time it gets to you under the prioritization program, one would hope that you're catching it in time.

03:36.947 --> 03:50.378
No, I wouldn't say that's true, because they haven't always been here, and, you know, you have a lot of inherent vice in books, which could mean that a book could be crucially rare,

03:50.797 --> 03:56.483
but not used very much, I mean, is one part of it, and in terrible, terrible shape.

03:57.444 --> 04:16.264
And if it doesn't happen to be something that the curator or the curators think is important, just because we have seven or eight million rare volumes, let's say, that's still a lot of books.

04:17.138 --> 04:21.585
that's still a very, very narrow point at the top that you're working from.

04:21.605 --> 04:28.034
So you can get rare books that are in terrible shape, absolutely terrible, especially with regard to the paper.

04:28.976 --> 04:37.108
I mean, if it was a rare book, say, from 1865, because it's not always aged, you're into a situation where you have terrible paper.

04:37.128 --> 04:40.353
I can show you one over here, too, that one of the interns is working on.

04:40.373 --> 04:44.479
The paper is atrocious.

04:45.286 --> 04:48.810
You're suggesting that because they're rare, they've generally been cared for better.

04:48.830 --> 04:49.191
No, no, no.

04:49.511 --> 05:02.207
I guess I'm interested in a larger... When I was at Cornell, they have this policy there that they call phase deterioration, and it really doesn't have anything to do with the rare books.

05:02.287 --> 05:09.977
But they've made a decision that this book is not going to fit into any preservation scheme.

05:10.345 --> 05:13.849
And so what they're going to do is, I guess, make it comfortable.

05:14.930 --> 05:16.212
Like a hospice.

05:16.412 --> 05:17.674
Yeah, that's exactly right.

05:18.154 --> 05:34.554
And they also say that if you pass at a certain point, and the reason this decision is made, apparently you pass at a certain point where it's impossible to enter, to intervene, and to reverse the deacidification process.

05:35.014 --> 05:37.598
Every book can be saved at some point.

05:37.618 --> 05:39.660
You may have to adjust the format.

05:40.096 --> 05:46.484
In other words, if you get paper which is down to zero-fold, it would be very difficult for you to rebind it.

05:47.105 --> 05:51.150
You know, any time anybody turned the page, it would come apart, even if you deacidified it.

05:51.470 --> 05:59.761
But you could encapsulate it in mylar and put it in a bound post-binding format so it could be still dealt with.

05:59.821 --> 06:06.930
Now, you're changing the format, you're putting something to intervene between the book leaf and your fingers,

06:07.535 --> 06:11.821
And you might ask, well, really, you know, why not just copy it?

06:13.323 --> 06:14.445
But we do that with some things.

06:14.505 --> 06:21.895
Some things are too brittle, but you want to retain them in the format that a book provides, as opposed to this scrolling format.

06:21.975 --> 06:29.565
Well, at Cornell, some of the books that they do digitize, they proceed to make hard copy copies and bind them.

06:30.727 --> 06:31.448
And they're doing this.

06:31.628 --> 06:35.594
When I was up there last year, they had already done about 5,500 books.

06:35.614 --> 06:35.854
Right.

06:36.543 --> 06:41.748
And as a practical matter also, they are, you know, they're largely 19th-century books.

06:42.469 --> 06:47.714
They have copyright problems, you know, so they have to be public domain books.

06:47.834 --> 06:53.120
Also in that period where the pulp and the acids, you know, it's a lousy paper.

06:54.161 --> 07:01.228
But when I went up there, I mean, these books, the spines are off, they've been guillotined, they've been stripped, so you can get a true copy.

07:01.248 --> 07:04.491
And then when they're done with that book, it goes to the landfill.

07:05.095 --> 07:10.781
and then they may make a hard copy.

07:11.041 --> 07:21.753
I mean, Cornell is very prominent in this whole thing and there are people who are fast behind it and a lot of other people who say it's vandalism.

07:22.173 --> 07:28.420
Where do you stand in that?

07:28.941 --> 07:31.103
I would be inclined to think they ought to go slow.

07:31.904 --> 07:33.525
I think it's very easy to make mistakes.

07:33.606 --> 07:34.967
I think it's very easy to get

07:35.622 --> 08:02.997
whipped up by the notion that you know slow fire is created the movie that the cultural heritage of the united states and the world is slowly disintegrating i think that's a fictitious um um agenda it's not there's a certain truth to it in i think in a much smaller portion and i think that there is this is like a job um creating environment to my mind it's it's it's again mass technology

08:03.500 --> 08:09.308
And I think that nobody considers the sidebars, which is that you've destroyed the book.

08:09.569 --> 08:12.112
And they're going to say, well, it's practically destroyed anyway.

08:12.393 --> 08:15.317
But there are going to be books that are not practically destroyed that are going to be destroyed.

08:15.517 --> 08:16.599
And it's the thin end of the wedge.

08:17.380 --> 08:25.612
Listen, I saw things up there that they were scanning, and they weren't necessarily books, but they were Harper's weeklies and monthlies.

08:26.613 --> 08:32.882
And we called one up on the screen, and I said, gee, that's a...

08:33.183 --> 08:34.686
I have no Winslow Homer.

08:34.706 --> 08:38.052
I said, that's a Winslow Homer wood engraving.

08:38.072 --> 08:39.494
I said, where's the original for this?

08:39.514 --> 08:40.296
I said, go on.

08:40.316 --> 08:44.924
I said, you know, you realize you sent a Homer engraving up to the landfill.

08:45.004 --> 08:47.568
This is a valuable piece of art.

08:47.588 --> 08:49.311
You could have sold it, perhaps, you know.

08:49.331 --> 08:50.714
They could have, but you see.

08:50.734 --> 08:51.976
Well, I mean, that's, I mean, you.

08:52.116 --> 08:53.599
But they don't want to get into that.

08:53.679 --> 08:55.883
They really don't want people to know.

08:56.977 --> 08:59.180
You know, like in San Francisco, I was up there last week.

09:00.742 --> 09:05.488
Do you have a card right away, Tom?

09:07.190 --> 09:13.277
This is a 13th century Cistercian gradual.

09:14.098 --> 09:15.900
Unfortunately, I'm not going to open it up.

09:15.960 --> 09:19.084
It's just been bound, and so it has to really drive.

09:19.885 --> 09:22.068
Pardon me?

09:22.088 --> 09:23.109
Is that a vellum?

09:23.450 --> 09:26.173
No, this is Allum Todd Caskin.

09:26.373 --> 09:27.835
Wow, that's beautiful, isn't it?

09:28.475 --> 09:29.877
It is, and it's very, very durable.

09:29.897 --> 09:35.142
It's the same process that they make baseballs from, which is always interesting to people.

09:36.804 --> 09:41.729
But the leaves are on vellum, and it's a very pretty book, and it's got wooden boards.

09:42.189 --> 09:43.311
And how old is that book?

09:43.331 --> 09:44.412
13th century.

09:44.912 --> 09:49.677
We'll have these clasps, which the binder made will go on it to hold the boards shut.

09:52.240 --> 09:53.241
And that's contemporary?

09:53.710 --> 09:55.192
Uh, it's a contemporary design.

09:55.212 --> 09:57.034
Oh, you made that?

09:57.074 --> 09:57.274
Yeah.

09:57.494 --> 09:57.995
Oh, okay.

09:59.036 --> 10:01.559
And what happened to the previous binding?

10:01.579 --> 10:05.523
This was in a nineteenth-century binding of absolutely no merit.

10:06.925 --> 10:20.680
You'll see some older books over here that are in the original bindings.

10:21.031 --> 10:22.293
Adams, et al.

10:22.313 --> 10:23.314
Oh, it's in the press?

10:23.434 --> 10:23.955
Nothing here?

10:24.996 --> 10:27.059
Well, we'll have to take our word for it.

10:27.139 --> 10:27.780
I do, I do.

10:29.262 --> 10:29.362
Okay.

10:29.382 --> 10:30.283
Can't see everything.

10:32.286 --> 10:39.335
And we've got some Wright Brothers material here that are being mended and then rehoused.

10:40.596 --> 10:45.663
A series of notebooks and diaries that they kept from 50 fellows that they were.

10:46.184 --> 10:49.468
Notebooks usually from banks and drug stores that they got for free.

10:50.596 --> 10:53.680
Kareen is doing some boxing.

10:53.700 --> 10:57.624
These are books from Inconabula.

10:58.145 --> 11:01.408
In this case, Alan taught pigskin, but it's the same material.

11:02.189 --> 11:03.050
It's 500 years old.

11:03.150 --> 11:05.153
And that does look like a 500-year-old body.

11:05.173 --> 11:07.475
Yes, it does.

11:07.656 --> 11:16.806
This is... Genealogy Boccaccio.

11:20.245 --> 11:32.460
This is from the Fine Printing Collection, so I'm not quite sure who the printer is here.

11:35.724 --> 11:40.109
Pretty nice shape, though, huh?

11:40.129 --> 11:46.337
Yeah, well, I mean, this is quality paper, and this kind of structure, this alum-taught pigskin,

11:46.857 --> 11:49.020
How do you spell that, Alum?

11:49.381 --> 12:01.458
Alum, A-L-U-M, hyphen, T-A-W-E-D.

12:01.478 --> 12:07.867
I'm working on a book from the Photographs Division of Rembrandt Action Restrikes.

12:10.551 --> 12:11.352
Have you got one there?

12:12.374 --> 12:15.278
Yes.

12:16.523 --> 12:20.369
Maybe you could just explain, what is a Lembrandt re-strike?

12:20.389 --> 12:24.054
This is a print, an engraving.

12:24.635 --> 12:34.009
His plates were done at a later time.

12:34.411 --> 12:37.797
It was collected by a collector.

12:38.197 --> 12:40.201
Beautiful.

12:40.221 --> 12:43.206
And the collector had an entire collection.

12:43.306 --> 12:47.112
I remember it was probably printed.

12:47.132 --> 12:51.640
And the album is his collection.

12:51.660 --> 12:53.342
Do you remember the name of the collector?

12:55.065 --> 12:56.568
I don't remember it.

12:56.588 --> 12:57.610
I don't remember it.

12:57.630 --> 12:58.571
It wasn't wrestling out there.

12:58.591 --> 12:59.593
It wasn't wrestling.

12:59.713 --> 13:00.034
I've got it.

13:00.054 --> 13:00.334
That's okay.

13:00.803 --> 13:02.465
And you're doing what again?

13:02.485 --> 13:08.330
You're just... Well, it's being rebound and I'm sewing it.

13:08.350 --> 13:08.630
I'm sewing it.

13:08.730 --> 13:16.337
I cast guard the ages of three and then it's going into a new binding.

13:16.357 --> 13:21.102
The original binding was just here.

13:22.002 --> 13:24.885
And how long has this particular item been in the collection, would you say?

13:25.526 --> 13:28.228
I think it's been here

13:29.137 --> 13:36.488
So it's taken us 40 years to get around to doing what you're doing.

13:37.349 --> 13:37.649
Yeah.

13:37.690 --> 13:40.393
But you haven't had to do anything with these prints?

13:40.534 --> 13:44.059
No, the plates have not had that many.

13:44.219 --> 13:45.681
They've been for so little cleaning.

13:46.262 --> 13:54.935
There were some poor quality face sheets that were removed and they were all crinkled and so on.

13:54.955 --> 13:56.477
How many plates were there?

13:56.761 --> 13:58.103
They're 49.

13:58.123 --> 13:59.905
Do you enjoy them while they're doing this?

13:59.925 --> 14:04.510
Well, you left them out because we generally give them away to visitors.

14:04.650 --> 14:05.491
You have one, right?

14:05.631 --> 14:07.653
Yeah, well, I guess we give them all away.

14:07.774 --> 14:10.557
Just watch them and let me out of the building.

14:10.737 --> 14:13.901
That's too bad.

14:13.921 --> 14:14.621
Thank you.

14:15.202 --> 14:15.783
That's great.

14:18.185 --> 14:22.831
Having finished a book here and is now shaping the spine.

14:22.851 --> 14:24.813
That will sit in the press overnight.

14:24.873 --> 14:25.654
That's a press conference.

14:25.938 --> 14:37.991
That's a lying press, and it's between back and forth, and that's what takes the rounded shape that you see with the book and gives it the shoulders in which the boards sit.

14:39.193 --> 14:41.135
What do we call this room again that we're in?

14:41.155 --> 14:47.101
This is the Rare Book Conservation Center.

14:47.121 --> 14:48.503
Well, you have a lying press.

14:48.972 --> 14:53.057
These are nipping presses, the larger presses that you see sitting in.

14:53.077 --> 14:54.178
And the nipping press does what?

14:54.379 --> 15:05.893
What you see right there, you see a book that's sitting in the press with brass rods in the joint for the purpose of accentuating that groove that you often see in the book.

15:05.913 --> 15:12.721
This is a vellum book, and vellum, being as hygroscopic as it is, needs to sit under pressure.

15:12.782 --> 15:13.743
What was the word?

15:13.803 --> 15:16.086
Hygroscopic, attractive to moisture.

15:17.107 --> 15:17.207
Okay.

15:17.508 --> 15:19.130
This is also used for box making.

15:19.150 --> 15:29.103
When you make a box like this, you would secure this tray to this case by putting it in the press and putting wooden blocks in it and pressing it down.

15:33.368 --> 15:35.251
This is the book she mentioned that was in the press.

15:35.271 --> 15:36.152
Now, she's sewn it.

15:36.873 --> 15:44.663
This is the Commissioner's Accounts of New York, the money that the American emissaries to France during the Revolutionary War spent

15:45.183 --> 15:49.988
on the cost of sort of getting your French to help them out.

15:50.208 --> 15:54.953
And that is, again, sitting in one of those lying... In a lying press.

15:55.133 --> 15:57.436
L-Y-I-N-D, lying press.

16:01.059 --> 16:11.830
This is an original cover to a book that John's working on, and he's in the process of taking out some of the techniques for making it reusable.

16:11.850 --> 16:14.413
This is a process which is a little bit unusual,

16:14.647 --> 16:27.823
often found in Germany, called Medusa, which is to say you have allotard material that's been colored and partially tanned with the use of Hermes or Cochineal, and that's what gives it the colored mask.

16:29.665 --> 16:32.228
What's your phone number here, if they have any follow-ups?

16:32.248 --> 16:33.930
I'll give you a follow-up.

16:33.950 --> 16:40.738
And Judith is working on, again, taking ovular materials, and you see, this is a nice little shot here.

16:41.225 --> 16:44.851
of missing words, and where do they go?

16:45.111 --> 16:52.543
And so she's got them next to her, a little Nina Simone, and that's all you need, really.

16:53.725 --> 16:56.169
And so are you the one who's putting the puzzle together?

16:56.189 --> 17:03.621
Are you pretty sure before you... Is there a copy to work from, or...?

17:04.698 --> 17:06.403
logic is common sense here.

17:06.924 --> 17:09.752
We're not going to probably be able to find where all of them go.

17:10.113 --> 17:12.720
They would be encapsulated and included through the book.

17:12.961 --> 17:18.336
What we're looking at are really almost little fragments, little pieces of paper from a

17:18.923 --> 17:25.874
This suffered water damage, and consequently to that, mold damage, and the paper softens and falls apart.

17:25.894 --> 17:28.738
And so how long ago do you think that might have happened?

17:28.758 --> 17:31.662
Was this just something recently discovered or something that recently happened?

17:31.803 --> 17:35.448
No, this would have happened sometime ago, possibly in its previous ownership.

17:35.468 --> 17:38.873
It's unlikely to have happened here.

17:38.893 --> 17:40.195
But this is 500 years old.

17:40.296 --> 17:43.040
It's a long and interesting history.

17:43.060 --> 17:43.260
Yeah.

17:44.141 --> 17:44.702
Great.

17:44.722 --> 17:47.867
Thanks.

17:49.096 --> 17:49.537
Good.

17:49.937 --> 17:52.080
Do you want to get a look at any place else?

17:52.100 --> 17:53.562
No, I think.

17:53.582 --> 17:57.628
So we're talking to Kenneth Harris, Preservation Projects Director.

17:58.489 --> 17:59.531
Anyway, that's what it is.

17:59.551 --> 18:02.996
We're talking to Kenneth Harris, the Preservation Projects Director.

18:03.236 --> 18:14.732
So I guess I'm kind of interested in what you do and the policies that govern it, and maybe we can just start in a very general manner like that.

18:15.438 --> 18:18.663
interested in mass deacetification specifically.

18:19.284 --> 18:28.198
I mean, it's a technology that the library's been working on development of since the mid-seventies.

18:29.961 --> 18:43.842
Chemists at the Library of Congress developed and patented a mass deacetification process called the diethyl zinc or D-E-Z process.

18:44.227 --> 18:51.517
worked on the development and perfection of that process for about twenty years, I guess, altogether.

18:52.899 --> 19:02.232
And after that process had been under development for a few years, a number of other processes began to emerge in the United States and in other countries, as you know.

19:02.413 --> 19:09.322
So, the library also got involved in evaluating and testing other processes.

19:09.342 --> 19:12.647
In the United States, this included the Wayto process,

19:13.201 --> 19:19.689
What did you call it, sir?

19:20.029 --> 19:20.610
W-E-I-T-O.

19:20.730 --> 19:24.215
That's another American developed process.

19:25.016 --> 19:33.686
It's been used at the National Archives and National Library of Canada for about, I think, 17 years.

19:34.467 --> 19:39.934
It's a liquid phase process, what we call a liquid phase process.

19:40.927 --> 19:56.141
These deacertification processes break down roughly into gas processes, a gas approach to deacertification, using a gas to formulate the book, or using a liquid approach to neutralizing the acids in the books.

19:56.742 --> 20:00.906
So the process that you've heard of, for example, in Germany, is a liquid phase process.

20:01.106 --> 20:07.412
It's a derivative of this weight-toe process that was developed in the United States in the early 70s.

20:07.432 --> 20:08.773
So the libraries

20:08.990 --> 20:16.059
The DES process that I indicated our chemists developed in the seventies is a gas process.

20:17.520 --> 20:25.790
It was fully developed and perfected, but the chemical company that was working with the library got out of the business about three years ago.

20:26.792 --> 20:28.213
So that was the end of that process?

20:28.273 --> 20:29.335
That was the end of that process.

20:29.635 --> 20:32.078
It's not currently being commercialized.

20:33.059 --> 20:33.580
Was it good?

20:33.600 --> 20:34.261
Was it a good process?

20:34.281 --> 20:37.765
It's a very good process, yes, very effective.

20:38.318 --> 20:40.562
The two major disadvantages are safety factors.

20:40.942 --> 20:42.625
The chemical is pyrophoric.

20:44.688 --> 20:46.090
I'll start with the word once again.

20:46.170 --> 20:49.255
Pyrophoric, P-Y-R-O, phoric.

20:50.878 --> 20:57.428
It means you have to exercise real explicit safety precautions in handling and converting the chemical.

21:00.753 --> 21:03.297
It can blow up in the presence of oxygen or water.

21:03.817 --> 21:05.579
Chemistry.

21:05.639 --> 21:07.101
And did it in fact do that once?

21:07.601 --> 21:15.750
Well, it did it once in a test chamber at NASA back seventeen years ago in 1985, December of 85 and February of 86.

21:16.071 --> 21:21.477
And was it in conjunction with a test for, specifically for this kind of thing?

21:21.777 --> 21:23.779
For deacidification for the library.

21:23.880 --> 21:25.722
There was a company called Northrop.

21:26.623 --> 21:27.584
Did they make airplane?

21:27.604 --> 21:28.545
Northrop Industries.

21:28.625 --> 21:33.250
It was under contract to NASA, and the library was working through NASA.

21:34.208 --> 21:47.565
with this company in Northrop, and they were doing some testing, and some—I wasn't around, so I don't have first-hand knowledge of this, but what I've read of it is that some diethylzinc, some of this chemistry was still in a test chamber.

21:48.346 --> 21:50.068
They weren't using the real library books at all.

21:50.088 --> 21:52.732
In fact, at that point, that test chamber was empty.

21:54.835 --> 21:58.319
They're still trying to figure out how to develop the process.

21:58.339 --> 21:58.659
They were.

21:58.740 --> 22:03.726
It was very much in the early developmental stage when they weren't even dreaming of doing anything with real books.

22:04.668 --> 22:19.866
Evidently, the gauges did not indicate to the engineers present that there was still some dizz in the bottom of the cylinder, and some water was introduced, and it caused a flash fire inside the cylinder.

22:19.886 --> 22:20.948
But no one was hurt.

22:21.268 --> 22:22.129
No books were damaged.

22:22.149 --> 22:25.533
There weren't any books anywhere near it.

22:25.693 --> 22:34.624
There was a second event in February of 86, the following year, and after that, I think NASA and or Northrop decided they didn't want anything else to do with it.

22:35.802 --> 22:40.526
Well, they basically—you hear rumors that the library had about a test chamber that blew up or something.

22:40.546 --> 22:42.568
That's not the case at all.

22:42.808 --> 22:44.690
But they certainly must have been prized for reflection.

22:44.750 --> 22:45.290
It was.

22:45.530 --> 22:46.411
It was, I'm sure.

22:47.632 --> 22:55.219
Well, then the library sought out the assistance of a professional chemical company that had sophisticated experience in dealing with the chemistry itself.

22:55.279 --> 23:01.364
And that's when the library went to Texas Alkyls, a large commercial chemistry company in Texas.

23:01.524 --> 23:02.065
Texas?

23:02.705 --> 23:05.708
In Texas, called Texas Alkyls, A-L-K-Y.

23:06.295 --> 23:08.418
A-O-K-Y-L-S.

23:08.598 --> 23:09.299
Okay.

23:09.459 --> 23:13.945
It was bought up and eventually became AXO, A-K-Z-O.

23:14.526 --> 23:15.968
And these are the people you're working with?

23:15.988 --> 23:16.289
Chemical.

23:16.349 --> 23:19.974
No, it was a company we worked with until 1994 when they got out of the business.

23:19.994 --> 23:22.818
Oh, they're the people who discontinued this process.

23:22.838 --> 23:23.559
That's right.

23:23.579 --> 23:33.332
So they worked with the library for several years, developed a test facility in Texas, did a number of test runs for the library, basically perfected the process, but then they reached the conclusion that

23:34.308 --> 23:41.757
But they weren't going to get a large enough business from the library and archival community nationwide to make a good business venture for them.

23:41.777 --> 23:48.786
But they said that they basically had made this public announcement that they were leaving the business because it wasn't going to be profitable enough.

23:48.806 --> 23:51.710
And nobody else could pick up on it.

23:51.730 --> 23:52.691
No one else could pick up on it.

23:52.811 --> 24:04.045
So the one big comparison that's frequently made between DES and some other processes is that the DES process was, you might say, capitalization-intensive.

24:04.345 --> 24:08.049
The physical plant is fairly expensive.

24:08.971 --> 24:11.674
More expensive than for other processes.

24:11.714 --> 24:12.955
What were the advantages of it?

24:13.876 --> 24:33.660
One of the advantages is that since it's a gas phase process, it permeates all kinds of the papers more deferentially, I mean, without discrimination, and more thoroughly.

24:34.400 --> 24:43.849
every variety of book paper that you can imagine than other processes that we've tested and evaluated.

24:43.869 --> 24:48.834
Some other processes are very good, but they don't penetrate a variety of papers.

24:48.894 --> 24:59.665
I'm talking about coated paper stock, wood ground paper, supercalendar paper, every kind of paper that you can imagine a book being printed on, including coated book stock, kind of art books.

25:00.016 --> 25:02.460
And did you have to open them, or did you just kind of put the books?

25:02.480 --> 25:04.223
Well, in fact, they were put in the chamber closed.

25:04.263 --> 25:09.411
In fact, you could put several hundred of the books in one facility, one test chamber at a time.

25:10.152 --> 25:11.093
Several hundred.

25:11.113 --> 25:12.055
This wasn't done here.

25:12.075 --> 25:13.237
It was done in Texas.

25:13.477 --> 25:15.801
So you'd have to send the books to Texas?

25:15.821 --> 25:16.261
That's right.

25:16.742 --> 25:17.083
That's right.

25:17.103 --> 25:18.605
Or ship them by train or whatever?

25:18.685 --> 25:19.667
By truck.

25:19.687 --> 25:21.249
By truck.

25:21.409 --> 25:22.371
And how many were you doing?

25:23.873 --> 25:24.875
We were only doing tests.

25:24.975 --> 25:27.559
We were never treating real laboratory books.

25:27.792 --> 25:41.099
For some other libraries it was in the last year that we were perfecting the process with Exo Chemical Company, solving the last two remaining problems that we knew of with the process.

25:41.139 --> 25:43.825
Some other libraries were actually treating real library materials.

25:44.106 --> 25:46.671
Harvard-wise, really?

25:46.731 --> 25:48.214
Harvard, Johns Hopkins.

25:50.995 --> 25:52.858
Northwestern did some tests.

25:52.878 --> 26:00.969
I don't know if they were treating—I don't think Northwestern was actually treating library books, but I think Harvard and Johns Hopkins were probably their primary customers.

26:02.751 --> 26:03.131
Sally Sleuth?

26:03.192 --> 26:04.053
Pittsburgh?

26:05.735 --> 26:06.536
I don't think so.

26:06.776 --> 26:07.998
Pittsburgh State?

26:08.018 --> 26:10.582
I don't think so.

26:10.602 --> 26:11.503
They had other customers.

26:11.523 --> 26:14.607
I know they had other customers, but I'm not sure right now who they were.

26:15.194 --> 26:18.097
Two of the larger customers were Harvard and John Thomas.

26:18.117 --> 26:19.218
Was this exciting?

26:19.418 --> 26:33.450
Were you very optimistic that this was— It was very exciting, and it was exciting, especially when Dr. Shahani, our head research chemist here, basically worked with the engineers of this company and solved problems.

26:33.551 --> 26:44.020
One of the ongoing problems with that process through the years was that it imbibed an odor, post-treatment odor, into books, which wasn't very desirable.

26:44.675 --> 26:48.299
But, I mean, that's the last problem that was solved.

26:48.319 --> 26:50.461
I mean, they figured out how to get it out of books.

26:51.102 --> 26:53.725
So that problem was solved before Axel got out of the business.

26:54.406 --> 27:02.675
So there are, for example, interests in other countries, like in the Netherlands right now, who are thinking about commercializing the DES process.

27:03.436 --> 27:08.362
So it may, in fact, get commercialized someplace else earlier than it does New York City.

27:08.442 --> 27:10.063
I haven't seen it in the Netherlands in a couple of weeks.

27:10.304 --> 27:11.425
It's a Dutch company.

27:11.692 --> 27:13.574
interestingly, to start with.

27:13.694 --> 27:22.024
But the Dutch National Archives and Library have both been very interested in the test process.

27:22.044 --> 27:38.764
In spite of that, I think they're both working very actively right now with a Dutch company, a Dutch purveyor of preservation supplies and services, a company called Archie Mascon.

27:38.784 --> 27:40.146
It's a Dutch company.

27:41.257 --> 27:43.219
I think that's A-R-C-H-I.

27:43.760 --> 27:45.301
A-R-C-H-I.

27:45.942 --> 27:47.824
Hyphen M-A-S-C-O-N.

27:49.166 --> 27:50.948
I may have that wrong, but I think it's correct.

27:51.188 --> 28:02.540
If you ask the people at the Dutch, at the Royal Dutch Archives, who are also working with the library, they're physically joined to one of those two buildings.

28:02.560 --> 28:07.045
You'll see when you go there and visit that the archives are really kind of providing leadership here.

28:07.632 --> 28:09.074
for both of those institutions.

28:09.154 --> 28:11.817
And as I understand it, they're working with that Dutch company.

28:11.837 --> 28:19.625
And that Dutch company is working with the company of Pittsburgh that we're currently using to actually deacidify real library books for the first time.

28:19.645 --> 28:20.286
And who is that?

28:20.727 --> 28:25.972
It's a company called PTI, Preservation Technologies, Incorporated.

28:26.233 --> 28:29.576
I'll give you some information here.

28:29.596 --> 28:35.563
There's an article here that appears in the library's information bulletin in April.

28:36.691 --> 28:42.857
And there's a short and probably to you useful article here about that.

28:43.277 --> 28:46.881
The library uses that process and also mentions what we did with DES in the past.

28:47.061 --> 28:47.661
I can have that?

28:47.681 --> 28:48.602
Some other things, yes.

28:48.662 --> 28:55.809
And I think also perhaps in one of the last paragraphs here it mentions some of the things that are being looked into in other countries.

28:55.989 --> 29:01.194
It mentions several of the other countries where deacidification is being developed or looked into.

29:01.895 --> 29:03.036
This will mention that

29:03.387 --> 29:07.072
PTI Company and their process, which is called Bookkeeper.

29:07.853 --> 29:10.977
These are pictures of Bookkeeper equipment.

29:10.997 --> 29:14.021
There's two kinds of treatment cylinders.

29:14.041 --> 29:15.522
This one and a horizontal one.

29:15.663 --> 29:16.524
There's some pictures there.

29:16.944 --> 29:27.638
This Dutch company, as I understand it, is working with PTI Company in Pittsburgh to get them to build both of these kinds of equipment on a test basis for use by these Dutch institutions.

29:27.738 --> 29:33.225
And then this Dutch company is going to sell services to these major cultural institutions in the Netherlands.

29:33.728 --> 29:38.734
And I suppose if they're successful, they'll probably sell it to services to other institutions in Europe.

29:39.816 --> 29:42.159
So that's just in the developmental stage right now.

29:42.179 --> 29:45.983
I understand they have a contract with the company in Pittsburgh to build them equipment.

29:46.084 --> 29:48.326
And what's the essence of this particular thing?

29:48.346 --> 29:56.817
Okay, this and the German process that you'll see in Leipzig, and the Waito process in Canada.

29:57.556 --> 30:03.523
processes being developed at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, which you'll see in Sable if you go there.

30:03.543 --> 30:04.945
They're all liquid processes.

30:04.985 --> 30:14.877
So, compared to the process developed at the library some years ago, which was a gas process, these are all liquid processes.

30:15.998 --> 30:16.339
Okay?

30:16.359 --> 30:18.581
So, basically, three kinds of deacertification processes.

30:18.601 --> 30:23.507
The gas process diffuses a chemical like calcium.

30:23.547 --> 30:25.690
In this case, our gas process uses zinc.

30:26.497 --> 30:30.642
It's actually the chemical zinc neutralizes the acid in books with the DES process.

30:31.883 --> 30:36.508
Most of these liquid phase processes use calcium or magnesium.

30:37.710 --> 30:42.395
One of the processes, a new German process, uses both calcium and magnesium.

30:42.415 --> 30:53.888
So those three chemicals, zinc, magnesium, and calcium are the basic three neutralizing agents that are used to neutralize the acid in books with all these processes.

30:54.121 --> 30:57.064
diffuses, I mean DES diffuses zinc into books.

30:57.104 --> 31:03.490
These liquid processes imbibe calcium or magnesium deposits into the paper to neutralize the acids.

31:04.271 --> 31:06.553
Now, what's different about bookkeeper?

31:06.573 --> 31:08.195
Okay, you can picture this on the one hand.

31:08.235 --> 31:09.656
There's DES, which is gaseous.

31:10.697 --> 31:14.921
All the other processes except bookkeeper, which you could call liquid phase.

31:15.441 --> 31:22.288
What I mean by that is that a chemical, magnesium oxide or calcium oxide,

31:22.859 --> 31:29.606
a chemical is dissolved in a liquid carrier, in another chemical.

31:30.627 --> 31:37.414
And that dissolved chemical that's floating in another chemical permeates the bookkeeper.

31:37.434 --> 31:40.737
That's easy to understand because you know how things dissolve, how sugar dissolves in water.

31:41.338 --> 31:45.982
The thing that's different about the bookkeeper process is that it's not a liquid phase process.

31:46.002 --> 31:46.963
It's a liquid process.

31:47.023 --> 31:51.668
It's a process of kind of physical entrainment.

31:52.087 --> 31:55.230
magnesium oxide actually floats in the carrier.

31:55.250 --> 31:57.092
It's not dissolved in it.

31:57.112 --> 31:57.772
It's a suspension?

31:57.812 --> 31:59.794
So it's a suspension or a dispersion.

31:59.854 --> 32:04.158
I suppose either term is probably technically accurate.

32:04.178 --> 32:09.603
It's a process that has magnesium oxide particles in dispersion or suspension in the liquid.

32:11.605 --> 32:12.706
There are three books there.

32:12.746 --> 32:14.447
Is that basically how many you do at a time?

32:14.467 --> 32:15.288
There's only three.

32:15.348 --> 32:20.433
They only do three or four in this what they call Bookkeeper II equipment.

32:20.593 --> 32:21.874
You'll see this identified here.

32:22.124 --> 32:32.896
Most books that they've been treating for the Library of Congress, under current contract they're treating eighty-eight thousand books for us, are treated in this kind of cylinder, which is a vertical cylinder.

32:33.296 --> 32:36.299
I think there's probably like a diagram here.

32:36.780 --> 32:41.305
There's two racks in each vertical cylinder, and each rack, top and the bottom, holds four books.

32:41.405 --> 32:43.507
So each one of these cylinders holds eight books at a time.

32:43.948 --> 32:45.469
Is it going to be four cylinders?

32:45.490 --> 32:47.191
Two thirty-two books approximately.

32:47.211 --> 32:49.694
It's not exactly simultaneous, but that's the way it works.

32:49.714 --> 32:50.715
But it costs ten thousand either.

32:51.196 --> 32:51.456
No.

32:51.740 --> 32:57.166
Well, you have to do the, interestingly enough, you jump to the same conclusion I do, and everyone does.

32:57.767 --> 33:06.156
You think, well, you know, you have a test chamber in Texas where you could do 40,000 books in a year, and you put 300 or 400 books in there at a time, that's got to be more efficient.

33:07.438 --> 33:09.460
And in fact, all the processes are different.

33:09.480 --> 33:15.207
You take a DES process, it could be upscaled so that you could treat several thousand books at a time.

33:15.247 --> 33:20.633
But what we were doing before we were doing, we was, in Texas, we were capable of treating 40,000 books in a year.

33:21.187 --> 33:23.689
One cycle with that process took about four days.

33:24.831 --> 33:27.833
So before you could open a cylinder, I'd take the three or four hundred books out.

33:27.914 --> 33:29.735
Four days had passed.

33:29.755 --> 33:36.021
With some of these liquid processes, like this, you put books in, you can actually take them out completely dried, and then you can put back on the shelf in two hours.

33:37.303 --> 33:46.992
So even though there's only eight books in this cylinder, this company is running these four cylinders around the clock on three shifts, as I understand it.

33:47.782 --> 33:53.830
capable of treating, just with those four little cylinders, over 100,000 books a year.

33:53.850 --> 33:54.251
Wow.

33:54.271 --> 34:10.333
In other words, though it's more labor-intensive, the cycle time is so much less, even though the labor is more intensive, they're capable of treating more books on that small scale than the sun.

34:10.373 --> 34:12.697
Is the Leipzig thing similar to this?

34:13.598 --> 34:15.440
I've got pictures of it I can show you.

34:15.480 --> 34:17.383
I'm sure you'll see it in Germany, too.

34:17.414 --> 34:25.942
They have two fairly small cylinders that hold a few books at a time, but they're round cylinders too, but they're mounted this way.

34:25.962 --> 34:27.103
They're lying down on the side.

34:27.343 --> 34:29.705
And it kind of goes through assembly line fashion?

34:29.725 --> 34:31.307
Yeah, so to speak.

34:31.327 --> 34:32.588
Do you have to open the book?

34:32.608 --> 34:34.850
Do you have to, you know, flare the cages or something?

34:35.050 --> 34:36.972
I don't think so with the Battelle process.

34:36.992 --> 34:38.593
I think they put them in baskets.

34:40.235 --> 34:43.177
I think that they're not opened or flared as much.

34:43.397 --> 34:46.240
With this process, since this process imbibes chemical,

34:46.979 --> 34:55.997
more onto the surface, and it doesn't soak in as readily as it does into the interstices of the book page as quickly as it does with the other liquid phase processes.

34:56.639 --> 35:02.190
Processes like this and one other process I know of depend on fanning the pages of the book open.

35:02.210 --> 35:02.571
Fanning?

35:03.212 --> 35:05.637
Well, and they do that, for example, with this process.

35:05.737 --> 35:08.683
They have nozzles around these cylinders.

35:09.254 --> 35:11.396
This may be described in this article, I'm not sure.

35:11.496 --> 35:13.318
And does an individual have to do that?

35:13.438 --> 35:13.678
No.

35:14.319 --> 35:29.695
No, there's actually nozzles on the exterior of each of these cylinders, and the books rotate very slowly, very slowly past these nozzles, and these nozzles present some turbulence, a little bit of turbulence in the liquid, and it helps span the pages of the books open.

35:29.715 --> 35:32.898
The cylinder is completely closed, so the chemistry won't evaporate.

35:33.679 --> 35:35.460
So it's kind of a hands-off process.

35:35.520 --> 35:38.063
Once the books are mounted and lowered,

35:38.279 --> 35:45.229
into each of the cylinders a completely airtight lid is put on top of it.

35:45.249 --> 35:48.093
Is it kind of like dry cleaning where you try to recycle?

35:48.113 --> 35:48.533
It is, in fact.

35:48.553 --> 35:49.374
It's a good parallel.

35:49.555 --> 35:51.277
They recycle—I understand.

35:51.317 --> 35:54.201
They say that they recycle about 95 percent of their chemistry.

35:54.381 --> 35:56.885
The chemistry is very expensive, so they want to recycle it.

35:57.245 --> 36:00.490
They recycle it and completely filter it, so it filters out any

36:01.128 --> 36:04.973
particulates or degradation products that it takes out of the books.

36:06.695 --> 36:11.701
Well, it's an interesting parallel.

36:11.722 --> 36:19.011
I know we used to have to recycle the perchloethylene.

36:19.712 --> 36:21.314
Well, that's interesting.

36:21.814 --> 36:22.635
This is a relative.

36:22.655 --> 36:30.966
I mean, the main chemical they're using here is perfluoroalkane, and then it looks white or milky like this just because it has magnesium particles floating in it.

36:31.435 --> 36:36.682
And some people compare a process like this to dry cleaning the books because, in fact, we get books back.

36:36.722 --> 36:37.884
They're actually a little bit brighter.

36:37.944 --> 36:42.150
Sometimes they actually look, some people actually joke and they say it looks like the books have been dry cleaned.

36:42.470 --> 36:43.532
It gets rid of odors.

36:44.153 --> 36:50.281
So this comes to, one of the virtues of this bookkeeper process is that it essentially does sort of dry clean the books.

36:50.882 --> 36:52.224
It takes out particulars.

36:52.384 --> 36:57.291
Everything's fine.

37:02.198 --> 37:14.893
This is the end of part one of the Kenneth E. Harris interview at the Library of Congress on September 18, 1997.

37:17.175 --> 37:28.408
The batteries went dead at this particular point and the interview picks up on side two of

37:28.979 --> 37:31.147
The LC Tape 1.

37:31.307 --> 37:35.181
It's slugged LC 1 and this is LC 2.

37:35.262 --> 37:41.183
So the Harris Tape continues on LC 1 side 2.
