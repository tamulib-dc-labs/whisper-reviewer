WEBVTT

00:03.288 --> 00:03.909
There we go.

00:04.009 --> 00:05.711
We're taping Alice Hoffman.

00:06.913 --> 00:09.176
Anyway, we're talking about Gwen.

00:09.256 --> 00:12.240
She really does emerge as a character in this book, doesn't she?

00:13.081 --> 00:13.441
She does, I think.

00:13.462 --> 00:15.304
And I think, of course, Hank as well.

00:17.146 --> 00:22.113
The younger characters really do become almost role models in reverse, wouldn't you think, in a way?

00:23.375 --> 00:24.216
I think.

00:24.236 --> 00:26.038
I think it's very true.

00:26.138 --> 00:29.683
And I think sometimes that happens, you know, just as teenagers are kind of going through things.

00:30.001 --> 00:33.786
some kind of, you know, the parents go through some crisis where the roles are reversed.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.770
I think it's really interesting when that happens.

00:37.912 --> 00:41.216
Was this something mindful that you think you pursued?

00:41.236 --> 00:50.149
Well, you know, this book was in part, you know, kind of my paying homage to Wuthering Heights.

00:50.769 --> 00:54.775
I never would have guessed.

00:54.795 --> 00:58.540
And I think, you know, what's interesting in that book is that...

00:58.891 --> 01:15.567
You know, is that people tend to forget that there's another generation and that the second half of the book is all about that second generation and kind of what their history and what the past has done to them and what the legacy, you know, your parents and relatives leave to you.

01:15.749 --> 01:19.392
So that's really kind of what I was working from with Hank and Gwen.

01:20.433 --> 01:30.322
You know, it's interesting that as the father of a 16-year-old daughter, and as I'm reading this, and my daughter Barbara says, Daddy, you haven't put that book down.

01:30.342 --> 01:31.984
I said, Barbara, I think you'd like this.

01:32.144 --> 01:35.387
And she loves to read, you know, and she reads faster than I do.

01:35.587 --> 01:43.575
And I'm thinking, you know, of the many reasons that I think she'd like it is I like the way Gwen decides not to sleep with Hank.

01:43.775 --> 01:45.096
You know what I'm saying?

01:45.116 --> 01:45.216
Yeah.

01:45.196 --> 01:45.877
Yeah, I do.

01:46.577 --> 01:47.959
And I was kind of concerned.

01:47.979 --> 01:52.303
I thought, oh, Jesus, we're going to have an incestuous relationship here.

01:52.843 --> 01:54.485
And thankfully we don't.

01:55.165 --> 02:06.236
Well, I think, you know, I think what happens with Gwen is that, you know, she starts out to be kind of this kid who just goes along with the crowd and she becomes more and more of an individual, more and more of an independent thinker.

02:06.256 --> 02:07.757
I mean, it's really about her growing up.

02:08.778 --> 02:10.460
And I think that's what growing up is about.

02:10.540 --> 02:14.123
And the fact that she is not with a crowd, that she's like taken out of the crowd,

02:14.457 --> 02:16.119
It's kind of left to her own devices.

02:17.000 --> 02:22.207
And then she even disdains the crowd, even in the new place.

02:22.668 --> 02:23.289
Right.

02:23.309 --> 02:24.630
I mean, I have to say, I like her.

02:24.871 --> 02:25.632
Yeah, she's great.

02:27.254 --> 02:29.317
Do you ever think of bringing any of these characters back?

02:29.337 --> 02:31.800
I don't know.

02:31.820 --> 02:35.625
I mean, it's kind of a sad thing to say goodbye, but no, it seems like when they're done, they're done.

02:35.665 --> 02:39.570
You know, they kind of go off to their own lives, and it doesn't have much to do with me.

02:39.635 --> 02:45.181
I know when I read a book that I really like, I really do worry about the characters, you know?

02:45.842 --> 02:52.729
And I was really kind of, and I'm not going to put this in my story, of course, but I said, geez, did Hank have to give up all the money?

02:52.749 --> 02:54.451
I mean, couldn't he have kept any?

02:54.471 --> 02:55.212
Yes, he did.

02:55.753 --> 02:56.273
Did he really?

02:56.293 --> 03:04.702
I think, yeah, I think it was really important that he kind of starts his own life unburdened by the legacy of the past, and I think that was part of it.

03:05.443 --> 03:07.245
And I think, you know, also when you see

03:07.495 --> 03:21.960
I think for some people when they see what, you know, what, it can be, it doesn't have to be money, it can be many different things, but the tie that binds you to some kind of, you know, terrible bargain, I think he had to, I think he had to cut that tie.

03:22.008 --> 03:24.211
Excellent point.

03:24.552 --> 03:29.039
So do you mind if we just pursue the Wuthering Heights angle just a tad?

03:31.302 --> 03:48.488
You know, a concern there is that, of course, if you're too close to the model, then you certainly want to hold out some mystery, some surprises for the reader, right?

03:48.468 --> 03:50.271
But you did that, I think.

03:50.411 --> 03:51.152
Oh, well, thanks.

03:51.232 --> 04:03.791
I think, you know, I wanted to, I mean, I could never tell that story, but, I mean, I'm so in awe of that book that I wanted to take some of those things and kind of see what would happen if they took place in my world.

04:04.773 --> 04:05.674
Do you know what I mean?

04:06.115 --> 04:08.759
So this was, okay, what if Kathy didn't die?

04:08.799 --> 04:10.582
You know, what if he moved to California?

04:11.383 --> 04:17.192
And, you know, I guess, you know, people have such strong feelings about that book and what it means, and

04:17.510 --> 04:24.458
and such diverging feelings about Heathcliff and, you know, just the nature of love.

04:24.518 --> 04:26.320
I mean, was it a perfect love?

04:26.340 --> 04:27.502
Was it demonic love?

04:27.522 --> 04:37.794
I mean, that book raises so many questions and doesn't give answers, and I think that's one of the things that makes the book continuing to be interesting is that it doesn't give you the answers.

04:37.854 --> 04:39.256
It just raises these questions.

04:40.036 --> 04:45.643
So I didn't want to, you know, feel anything or copy anything, but I just wanted to use some of those things that I think

04:46.484 --> 04:48.827
she dealt with so amazingly.

04:49.268 --> 04:57.659
You know, how many writers say, quite persuasively, that it is fiction that resonates, you know, and that teaches you about things.

04:58.180 --> 05:03.748
And here you are, you're paying homage to a novel that continues to make us think about where we are today.

05:03.788 --> 05:05.430
I think it's really true.

05:05.871 --> 05:15.664
And, you know, I mean, I think that I always have the sense that, you know, there's a certain truth in fiction that's not in non-fiction because

05:16.724 --> 05:27.374
because it comes from kind of an unconscious position that's not being guarded so that in a way I think, you know, it doesn't matter if Emily Bronte knew what she was saying.

05:27.394 --> 05:30.683
It still has these amazing lessons to teach us.

05:30.713 --> 05:40.455
You know, you said in our, and I'm looking here, at our 1995 interview, and let's see, my daughter's also found the earlier interview.

05:40.475 --> 05:44.926
Isn't that great, kids doing your filing for you?

05:45.407 --> 05:47.271
But you are really a product of your reading.

05:48.078 --> 05:57.151
You personally, you know, that you're... I think that's really an appropriate statement in view of this particular book.

05:57.632 --> 06:00.697
Well, you know, I think, you know, for me it was true of Weathering Heights.

06:00.717 --> 06:02.379
There are other books that are true of it.

06:02.399 --> 06:06.685
I think it is for most people who are readers, you know, whether they become writers or not.

06:07.266 --> 06:16.600
I think, you know, one example of that is, you know, Catcher in the Rye, which is such a formula, you know, because...

06:16.985 --> 06:20.111
impacted so many people on a very personal level.

06:20.151 --> 06:25.722
I think there are books that kind of speak to you, depending on what time of your life you read them.

06:27.025 --> 06:36.023
And, you know, not that I think those are the only lessons to learn, but, you know, I certainly feel like people who read, I think...

06:37.150 --> 06:41.381
I think they're kind of more open to different points of view.

06:41.401 --> 06:50.123
You know, another thing, if you don't mind my revisiting some of these areas, that's one of the good things I like about doing multiple interviews with authors over the years, by the way.

06:50.163 --> 06:52.830
Because, of course, you remember what we said and you have no idea.

06:52.810 --> 06:56.115
Well, that's fine, but I'll read a little bit to you.

06:56.155 --> 06:58.058
You know, it seems very appropriate.

06:58.799 --> 07:12.360
I remember asking you, you know, do you find that, well, I don't want to read the whole interview to you, but in terms of becoming apparent and how it changed your fiction writing.

07:12.821 --> 07:17.468
But what I see now, here's a particularly telling quote.

07:17.448 --> 07:21.112
We were talking about discipline and how you had to work faster.

07:21.133 --> 07:22.474
You didn't have the luxury of time.

07:22.514 --> 07:22.855
Right.

07:24.316 --> 07:27.721
Even now I'm thinking, oh, my kids are going to come into this room.

07:27.741 --> 07:28.181
That's right.

07:28.682 --> 07:30.043
But then I said, but that's discipline.

07:30.103 --> 07:31.205
How about in terms of content?

07:31.225 --> 07:32.627
You said, but it will completely change it.

07:32.647 --> 07:35.730
I feel like I crossed over some line and went to the other side.

07:36.271 --> 07:38.794
I went from the child's point of view to the parent's point of view.

07:38.814 --> 07:41.177
I feel like I totally crossed over.

07:41.157 --> 07:44.482
And then I said, children still remain very much in the center of what you're doing.

07:44.582 --> 07:45.924
And you say, oh, yes, very much.

07:46.024 --> 07:49.209
I do still write about children a lot, but my allegiance changed.

07:49.229 --> 07:52.974
But I find, you know, that as your own children get older.

07:52.994 --> 07:53.915
I'm going backwards.

07:54.056 --> 07:59.744
I feel, you know, I do feel very close to that teenage girl.

07:59.764 --> 08:03.429
And I have a lot of, you know, I have a lot of readers who are mothers and daughters.

08:04.951 --> 08:08.937
It really makes me feel good, you know, that they hear my books.

08:09.710 --> 08:10.311
That's great.

08:10.631 --> 08:17.818
It's a really great feeling because I think it's really a way to communicate and a lot of times it's a point when you can't communicate.

08:19.740 --> 08:27.687
I have to tell you, do you mindfully develop that Gwen is going to become the wise young woman?

08:27.827 --> 08:33.113
I don't think I mindfully develop anything to tell you the truth.

08:33.753 --> 08:38.738
I think I have characters and I think I have an underlying theme, but other than that,

08:39.241 --> 08:45.050
I don't really know what's going to happen or what's going to happen to these characters until I'm done.

08:46.673 --> 08:52.782
You know, I haven't asked you the, we'll put it in quotes, the magic question that you must always be getting.

08:52.802 --> 08:57.549
But it is interesting that this wonderful horse is named Tarrot.

08:59.653 --> 09:01.215
Is that just a name that you like?

09:01.820 --> 09:03.543
Does he foretell anything?

09:03.563 --> 09:08.793
It's interesting because I feel like, you know, I don't think it out, but then when I look at it later, I feel like, oh, yeah, he's the future.

09:08.813 --> 09:09.794
He tells the future.

09:10.315 --> 09:10.456
Yeah.

09:10.636 --> 09:11.437
He tells the past.

09:12.599 --> 09:12.780
Both.

09:12.820 --> 09:14.263
I don't think about it when I'm doing it.

09:14.283 --> 09:15.705
You know, it's an unconscious thing.

09:15.745 --> 09:17.669
When I look at it, I think, oh, this is it.

09:17.689 --> 09:21.195
Makes perfect sense, doesn't it?

09:22.222 --> 09:26.307
And there are several points of view that you develop in this book which I think are interesting too.

09:26.447 --> 09:35.439
You're not writing from the point of view of this one woman or March or Hollis or this and that.

09:35.459 --> 09:42.208
You are developing multiple points of view here in this novel.

09:42.388 --> 09:46.333
Well, I think I'm interested in that.

09:46.353 --> 09:49.377
I'm interested in, and especially in this book, it's kind of about a town.

09:50.065 --> 09:58.457
And so you get the feeling of many voices and the feeling of kind of like a lot of life going on in the town.

09:58.678 --> 10:07.891
But I think it's also, I mean, I always find it interesting, you know, as a reader to think about, you know, the way that Wuthering Heights was told.

10:08.692 --> 10:11.055
It's told, you know, removed.

10:11.176 --> 10:14.581
It's told by somebody, to somebody, about somebody else.

10:15.181 --> 10:16.543
It's a story, you know?

10:16.984 --> 10:17.625
And I feel like

10:17.825 --> 10:22.029
You know, maybe it breaks it up a little and makes you feel like, oh, this is a story being told.

10:22.730 --> 10:27.956
But I think it gives you kind of a more interesting point of view.

10:29.457 --> 10:30.478
I have to say one thing.

10:30.558 --> 10:35.223
I always like to predict certain things when I'm reading it.

10:35.444 --> 10:43.512
Good writers like yourself, nothing is wasted and nothing is there that doesn't have a function, you know.

10:44.673 --> 10:46.524
Route 22, Route 22.

10:46.544 --> 10:50.970
And I said, Route 22 is going to play a very important role

10:51.963 --> 10:54.486
in this novel, one way or another.

10:54.526 --> 10:59.091
I thought maybe the two of them, you know, but no, it was correct the way you did it.

11:00.693 --> 11:12.126
But did you, when you were creating this town, I mean, I'm trying to place it because I love maps, you know, and so I mean, it's certainly a North Shore community someplace not far from Rye 93.

11:12.366 --> 11:14.028
But did you have a... I didn't.

11:14.469 --> 11:14.809
I didn't.

11:15.069 --> 11:18.954
I mean, I knew I wanted it to, I knew what I wanted it to look like and feel like.

11:19.474 --> 11:19.995
I didn't,

11:20.195 --> 11:22.017
It's not based on a real town.

11:22.097 --> 11:24.580
I knew I wanted it to be north of Boston.

11:25.060 --> 11:28.143
And the funny thing is, you know, after I wrote the book, I started to get panicked.

11:28.163 --> 11:30.686
And I thought, oh, my God, what if there is a Route 22?

11:30.806 --> 11:33.990
And I called up, is it AA or AAA?

11:34.010 --> 11:35.131
I forget what it's called.

11:35.151 --> 11:35.451
AAA, yeah.

11:35.591 --> 11:35.831
Yeah.

11:36.212 --> 11:40.116
And I said, you know, I'm just trying to find out if there's a Route 22 in Massachusetts.

11:40.136 --> 11:43.800
And they did their computer thing, and they came back and said, yeah, there is a Route 22.

11:43.860 --> 11:45.882
It's north of Boston.

11:46.435 --> 11:50.781
And I forget exactly where it is, but it is in the place where I thought of this town.

11:50.802 --> 11:54.287
And I thought, well, do I go out and drive this?

11:54.307 --> 11:55.208
And then I thought, no.

11:55.929 --> 11:56.871
It just is what it is.

11:57.231 --> 11:58.213
Yeah, that's interesting.

11:58.934 --> 12:01.718
I have a Route 122, which goes right by here.

12:02.179 --> 12:04.963
It's Central Mass.

12:04.983 --> 12:10.631
It goes through, I'm in Grafton, so it goes through Grafton, Shrewsbury, and it goes down towards Providence.

12:11.092 --> 12:13.896
Well, I guess there's a Route 22 somewhere like around Gloucester.

12:14.016 --> 12:14.958
Yeah, I'm sure there is.

12:14.978 --> 12:15.919
I mean...

12:16.878 --> 12:20.883
Let's say that's your business.

12:20.923 --> 12:21.263
You're right.

12:21.663 --> 12:27.250
And I'm glad you used, you know, I mean, it's a fictional town, but I'm glad you used otherwise real places and things, you know.

12:27.390 --> 12:31.975
I mean, it gives you as a writer, like, tremendous freedom to, you know, put anything anywhere you want.

12:31.995 --> 12:41.886
Yeah, but that is interesting that you do consider the town as much of a character, so to speak, as the characters themselves.

12:42.367 --> 12:44.269
I do, in this book especially, yeah.

12:44.418 --> 12:56.296
Chris, I don't want to ask you too many questions about the book, you know, but, you know, Children at Risk has always, not always, but it has been a continuing theme of yours.

12:57.117 --> 13:00.362
Are there themes that you're continuing to develop?

13:00.822 --> 13:03.466
No, I think that there probably are, but I think they're unconscious.

13:03.486 --> 13:13.581
I'm not really aware of them, and I think it's probably true that most writers have, you know, a story to tell, and that their story is different variations on, you know...

13:14.017 --> 13:22.267
you know, their major interest, and I'm not exactly sure what that is, and I'm not exactly sure it's good for a writer to think about that or know that, you know?

13:23.048 --> 13:24.810
So I don't know.

13:24.830 --> 13:26.632
I don't think about that much.

13:27.754 --> 13:30.797
Do you still write almost compulsively?

13:31.638 --> 13:33.060
Well, I pretty much write every day.

13:33.080 --> 13:39.568
I mean, you know, especially when I'm working on a specific project or toward the end of a project.

13:40.831 --> 13:45.419
So, you know, I write a lot, and I've written some kids' books lately also.

13:45.539 --> 13:45.840
Really?

13:45.960 --> 13:48.083
A real fun thing to do, yeah.

13:48.103 --> 13:49.065
Yeah, I love it.

13:49.085 --> 13:52.571
In fact, are these under contract, or is this something?

13:52.691 --> 13:54.094
Yeah, one is coming out this fall.

13:54.114 --> 13:56.097
It's being published by Hyperion.

13:56.117 --> 14:01.827
Okay, let me really make, I'm now writing a monthly children's book review.

14:02.617 --> 14:06.684
Yeah, I started it six months ago, and I'm telling you, this is as popular.

14:07.065 --> 14:08.407
I've really found a niche.

14:08.427 --> 14:10.351
I'm really treating children's books.

14:10.611 --> 14:12.574
I'm really, really devoted to them, you know.

14:13.516 --> 14:13.917
Wow.

14:13.937 --> 14:17.203
I'm writing a few children's books myself, but that's, you know, neither here nor there.

14:17.303 --> 14:26.599
Well, there's kind of a purity, it seems to me, in that section of business that's totally driven by what kids want to read, which is really nice.

14:26.579 --> 14:30.546
And I've found that I'm able to place this in newspapers.

14:30.766 --> 14:35.474
Orlando is taking me, for instance, I'm their children's book reviewer.

14:36.696 --> 14:38.359
And Denver is about to take it.

14:38.540 --> 14:45.552
I've got maybe eight papers taking this monthly book review of eight books.

14:45.712 --> 14:49.178
Actually, my wife, I say we, but it is definitely a we.

14:49.529 --> 14:51.775
Is she involved?

14:51.795 --> 14:52.938
I couldn't do it.

14:52.959 --> 14:55.185
Are you kidding?

14:55.205 --> 14:59.978
I basically sit down at the computer after she's made the selection and written up the

15:00.548 --> 15:26.792
you know, the reviews, and then I write them, and we actually have like an editorial conference where we discuss what we want to do, and we get art, so we distribute art to the papers, and we get terrific pickup, you know, so please make sure, and I have good connections with, I mean, good relationship with Hyperion, so please make sure, you know, you'll be very pleased with the

15:27.262 --> 15:30.267
And I give it about 150 or 200 word review.

15:30.327 --> 15:34.813
I mean, I really treat it on its merits, you know, and take it on its own terms.

15:34.913 --> 15:41.884
I had a huge, for this new book of writing, I finally, it took me a year and a half, but I had an interview with Maurice Sendak.

15:42.084 --> 15:43.667
Oh, that must have been, that's right.

15:43.687 --> 15:44.949
Yeah, it was magnificent.

15:44.989 --> 15:47.953
In his house, you know, among his things.

15:48.237 --> 15:50.299
Did he have German Shepherds?

15:50.319 --> 15:52.020
No, he didn't have any dogs when we were there.

15:52.040 --> 15:52.801
I think he died.

15:53.521 --> 15:57.985
But we're going back, and I'm going back in another two or three weeks to finish up.

15:59.186 --> 16:02.689
Civilization magazine is taking a piece from me on him.

16:02.729 --> 16:03.890
That's fantastic.

16:03.910 --> 16:05.251
I'm glad you're really busy.

16:05.271 --> 16:05.472
I am.

16:05.492 --> 16:08.354
Well, hey, I've got to make a living.

16:08.374 --> 16:09.555
You don't slow down.

16:10.396 --> 16:12.738
But Sendak, I have to tell you, this is so great.

16:12.758 --> 16:17.562
He won't let me use this, but he is such a product of his reading, like yourself.

16:17.722 --> 16:17.822
Yeah.

16:18.781 --> 16:22.267
You know, he never went to college, Sendak.

16:22.287 --> 16:28.136
You know, everything he is, everything his work is, is energized by what he's read.

16:28.196 --> 16:33.665
Now he's totally obsessed with Shakespeare and Keats, and he also buys things.

16:34.286 --> 16:39.955
To understand Melville, he went and he snuck, and he actually was lying down in Melville's bed, you know.

16:41.057 --> 16:44.222
And he sat in his chair, and then he said, I can't use this.

16:44.242 --> 16:46.105
I'm going to try and talk him into it.

16:46.793 --> 16:49.416
When the interview was done, he said, come on with me.

16:49.436 --> 16:59.888
And I go into his study, and he has a death mask of John Keats, which was molded within 24 hours of his death.

16:59.908 --> 17:03.792
And every time he goes to write, he touches this face.

17:04.273 --> 17:13.864
And you talk about being inspired by, you know, he literally has contact, physical tactile contact with Keats.

17:14.823 --> 17:18.888
It really blew me away, I have to say.

17:18.948 --> 17:22.532
But, you know, you talk about taking your reading to the extreme.

17:22.613 --> 17:24.114
You're not kidding.

17:24.755 --> 17:25.857
I can understand that.

17:25.977 --> 17:30.362
I mean, I don't think I could do that, but I can really understand wanting to do that.

17:30.382 --> 17:30.642
Yeah.

17:31.524 --> 17:32.805
Anyway, we're talking about reading.

17:32.825 --> 17:36.910
Can you give me just a... I have to tell you, I'm going out to San Francisco in two or three weeks.

17:36.990 --> 17:39.193
I'm having a chapter in this new book I'm doing.

17:39.764 --> 18:03.696
on reading you know the nicholson baker thing in new york and the new yorker about the destruction they they're very oh yes yes yeah uh well i'm interviewing everyone out there tilly olson you know who's a this whole band of what they call library activists out there there's one gray panther a woman who has 1300 books that were discarded by the san francisco public library and she's keeping them in her house

18:04.925 --> 18:07.669
Until they come back to their senses kind of a thing.

18:07.849 --> 18:10.332
I actually just wrote a little something about this.

18:10.352 --> 18:14.237
I think it's so horrible that they're destroying books and putting them on microfilm.

18:14.257 --> 18:17.681
I mean, San Francisco, that's the biggest scandal, but they do it everywhere a little bit.

18:17.742 --> 18:20.745
Well, I've been everywhere, and then that's just the tip of the iceberg.

18:20.785 --> 18:22.207
Yeah, I know, I know.

18:22.748 --> 18:28.215
I have one institution, Ivy League institution, thankfully not here,

18:28.803 --> 18:35.518
that by the year 2000 will have its collection of 6.8 million books down to 5 million.

18:36.159 --> 18:37.041
That is so disgusting.

18:37.061 --> 18:42.373
And then don't they say in the year 2000 something's going to happen with computers so that everything is going to be wiped out on computers?

18:42.893 --> 18:45.618
Oh, the bug, yeah, what do they call it?

18:46.138 --> 18:49.264
Yeah, the zero-zero is going to screw everything up, but that's billing.

18:49.284 --> 18:51.087
That's for those books.

18:51.127 --> 18:52.489
That would not affect the books.

18:52.870 --> 18:54.052
It wouldn't.

18:54.072 --> 19:02.185
That's billing, you know, like when you get your computer bill, the computer is going to see zero-zero, and instead of thinking 2,000, it's going to think 1,900.

19:02.165 --> 19:05.950
I don't trust any of it.

19:05.970 --> 19:07.391
But I don't trust any of it either.

19:07.411 --> 19:09.554
I don't take a book any day.

19:10.295 --> 19:14.980
But that is a, you know, you'll take a book any day, right?

19:16.002 --> 19:16.422
Yeah.

19:16.442 --> 19:18.625
Did you do much in libraries when you were a kid?

19:18.825 --> 19:20.767
Yeah, I spent a lot of time in libraries.

19:20.787 --> 19:25.513
I mean, you know, not educated time, but time.

19:25.833 --> 19:29.758
And, you know, my public library was really important to me.

19:30.295 --> 19:32.118
Because I could get there as a kid.

19:32.138 --> 19:34.282
You know, I could walk there and I could get where I wanted.

19:34.302 --> 19:35.625
Huge amounts of freedom.

19:36.066 --> 19:36.606
Where was this?

19:36.627 --> 19:38.390
It was on Long Island.

19:38.630 --> 19:38.951
Okay.

19:38.971 --> 19:40.393
You grew up on Long Island.

19:40.714 --> 19:40.874
Yeah.

19:42.517 --> 19:44.240
You know, I'm a big library fan.

19:44.401 --> 19:45.222
Very big.

19:45.262 --> 19:46.525
And continue to be, of course.

19:46.685 --> 19:46.785
Yeah.

19:47.440 --> 19:52.888
Well, Tilly Olson pointed out, you know, how many people learned everything they knew from libraries.

19:52.908 --> 19:54.670
And this is something I'm developing.

19:54.690 --> 19:59.196
You know, Shaw, for instance, everything he learned was from the British Library.

19:59.277 --> 20:02.541
And she said, well, Malcolm X, you know, everything was from the prison library.

20:04.143 --> 20:10.532
And I remember when I lived in California, I had relatives telling me, everyone used to tell them about the library so much.

20:10.552 --> 20:11.153
It was such a huge library.

20:11.674 --> 20:12.796
Well, you know who underwrote her?

20:13.076 --> 20:14.578
This new one is Pacific Bell.

20:15.335 --> 20:24.126
which is maybe one of the reasons why they're going into all this wired stuff.

20:24.347 --> 20:27.991
Anyway, it's a fascinating story that goes beyond.

20:28.031 --> 20:32.777
I've got interviews lined up with about 15 people when I go out there next month.

20:32.837 --> 20:38.845
But it's one of those cases where Nick Baker, really, his stories were just part of the story.

20:39.348 --> 21:01.525
and uh you know normally when something is written that that thoroughly i leave it alone but but i think in this case it's just the beginning because it really does more or less tell you everything about it's it's it's a it's a microcosmic example of what's going on everywhere i mean i'm very interested in this also anyway you know it's i don't want to take up too much of your time yeah well it's good to

21:02.213 --> 21:03.114
I just talked to you.

21:03.134 --> 21:03.695
You're just doing great.

21:04.015 --> 21:04.716
I'm having fun.

21:05.316 --> 21:06.958
And how about our next book?

21:06.978 --> 21:09.000
Are you well on to the next one?

21:09.020 --> 21:20.732
Yeah, I'm working on the next book, and I also have, you know, I have actually two kids' books coming out from Hyperion, and then I'm working on another book now, but it's not at the point where I feel like I can talk about it.

21:20.752 --> 21:24.256
Okay, well, can you tell me the title of the book that's coming out from Hyperion?

21:24.296 --> 21:25.757
Yeah, it's called Fireflies.

21:26.538 --> 21:26.879
One word.

21:27.319 --> 21:28.240
Uh-huh, one word.

21:28.921 --> 21:30.162
And what's the age group?

21:30.766 --> 21:33.289
The age group is, you know, it's kind of in all ages.

21:33.329 --> 21:34.491
I think they have a three to five.

21:34.511 --> 21:35.372
It's a folktale.

21:35.893 --> 21:39.758
And I think they did a beautiful job of it.

21:39.798 --> 21:40.599
I think it's really pretty.

21:40.619 --> 21:42.382
It's about a boy who's really clumsy.

21:44.084 --> 21:46.728
And his clumsiness kind of saves the day.

21:47.509 --> 21:48.370
And it's illustrated?

21:48.470 --> 21:50.673
Yeah, it's got beautiful illustrations.

21:50.913 --> 21:52.035
I think they're gorgeous.

21:52.055 --> 21:52.836
Who's the artist?

21:52.856 --> 21:56.120
The guy's name is Wayne McLaughlin, and this is his first kind of picture book.

21:56.140 --> 21:58.123
He's done other books for them, science books.

21:58.778 --> 22:02.162
but it's extremely beautiful.

22:02.983 --> 22:06.347
Very unique look to what I think.

22:06.368 --> 22:08.370
So what possessed you to do a children's book?

22:08.450 --> 22:13.997
Well, I wanted to do it before my kids got too old for me to read it to them.

22:14.017 --> 22:14.938
And how old are your kids now?

22:15.038 --> 22:16.420
Well, my youngest kid is nine.

22:17.481 --> 22:18.703
So it was either now or never.

22:19.925 --> 22:23.449
Is this a story that maybe you've worked on together?

22:23.950 --> 22:26.693
No, but he was the first person to hear it, and he kind of

22:26.977 --> 22:28.301
tell me what he thought about that.

22:28.722 --> 22:32.071
And it was, you know, it was a really, it was a nice experience kind of doing it together.

22:32.111 --> 22:37.746
And, you know, seeing the different, you know, seeing it first as a manuscript and then seeing the artist

22:38.232 --> 22:42.536
drawings coming in, and then seeing the whole process I think was really interesting for him.

22:43.717 --> 22:49.864
I think I do have one other question, if I can pose it in a way that makes sense.

22:49.904 --> 22:57.731
But do you think these recent books, certainly since you've had children, more or less reflect the continuing process of being a parent?

22:59.593 --> 23:01.015
Yeah, I think so.

23:01.575 --> 23:07.581
I mean, I feel like I can see it more from all sides now.

23:08.135 --> 23:15.382
I think, you know, first I saw it just from, you know, being a child, a child's point of view, you know, through my 30s or whatever, you know what I mean?

23:15.402 --> 23:15.743
Right, right.

23:16.023 --> 23:34.041
And then I think I saw it just from a parent's point of view, you know, when you have young children and you're so, that is so much your main interest is like being a caregiver and so much of it is physical work and, you know, and at this point I feel like, well, hopefully I can see it from all sides.

23:34.763 --> 23:36.908
That's the sense that I have here, too.

23:36.948 --> 23:46.849
And I don't find that... I know when my kids were 16 and 14, you know, you go through that phase where you're afraid to let them...

23:47.200 --> 24:12.027
go down for ice cream you know i mean you just have to let them go and then you really do have to let them go out you know and do what do whatever i mean i feel like my best response to a book would be like if you and your daughter both loved it yeah well i i she grabbed it and uh yeah well she and she's a very very she's a wonderful reader her insights are outstanding you know um

24:12.007 --> 24:13.468
I use these.

24:13.488 --> 24:18.914
I use my daughters and my wife, who loves biography and nonfiction.

24:18.934 --> 24:24.719
In fact, she'll read books that I want to read but don't have time to, and she'll basically tell me everything I want to know out of it.

24:24.739 --> 24:25.180
Oh, great.

24:25.640 --> 24:34.128
You know, like the biography of William Blake, which she's now into this Virginia Woolf biography by Hermione Lee, which is a family business.

24:34.148 --> 24:38.432
Yeah, well, Virginia Woolf was totally a product of her reading.

24:38.473 --> 24:38.993
Her reading.

24:39.462 --> 24:42.687
I mean, was never really formally educated.

24:43.469 --> 24:45.132
Everything was her father's library.

24:45.192 --> 24:51.943
And you read her notebooks, I mean, she gets very angry when real life intrudes on her reading, you know?

24:51.963 --> 24:52.404
That's so interesting.

24:52.424 --> 24:57.633
Well, I also feel like there are periods in your life that reading, that books make a big impression.

24:57.813 --> 25:01.800
I think one of those times when you're like, you know, kind of 15, 16.

25:01.820 --> 25:04.845
I think that really, it's a time when you're really open.

25:05.770 --> 25:12.844
And I think if you don't really develop it at that point, it's going to be awfully hard any other time.

25:13.212 --> 25:14.554
Yeah, well, anyway, it's nice to talk to you.

25:14.594 --> 25:17.718
Nice talking to you, and thanks for calling precisely at 9 o'clock.

25:17.779 --> 25:18.680
I was all ready for you.

25:18.700 --> 25:24.528
I have my coffee and my tape recorder, and there's no need to talk really anymore about the novel.

25:24.548 --> 25:25.530
I thought it was wonderful.

25:26.010 --> 25:29.455
Personally, I think it was, and I've read easily half a dozen of your books.

25:30.717 --> 25:32.700
I think it's the best one that I've read.

25:33.060 --> 25:34.402
I enjoyed it enormously.

25:34.502 --> 25:35.304
I appreciate it.

25:35.324 --> 25:36.385
I kind of think so, too.

25:36.665 --> 25:38.388
And the writing is really terrific.

25:38.728 --> 25:39.169
Thank you.

25:39.503 --> 25:47.875
You set that opening scene out there in the marshes, and I'm trying to figure what you're up to here.

25:47.915 --> 25:49.137
And I said, she's got the mood.

25:49.237 --> 25:49.878
It's right there.

25:49.918 --> 25:50.459
It's terrific.

25:50.519 --> 25:50.899
I'm hooked.

25:51.921 --> 25:56.527
So I wasn't much fun at the beach this weekend, but hey.

25:56.548 --> 25:57.088
Well, I'm glad for my sake.

25:57.108 --> 25:57.649
We'll talk to you.

25:58.891 --> 25:59.872
I'll talk to you soon.

25:59.892 --> 26:02.837
Okay, and please remind Hyperion to send me the kids' book.

26:02.857 --> 26:03.858
I definitely will.

26:03.878 --> 26:04.759
I hope you like it.

26:04.779 --> 26:05.460
I'm sure I will.

26:05.500 --> 26:06.422
Bye-bye.

26:06.442 --> 26:06.642
Take care.
