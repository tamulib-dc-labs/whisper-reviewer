WEBVTT

00:03.457 --> 00:06.901
A test at the National Leaders Center.

00:06.961 --> 00:08.043
Here we are in our car.

00:08.063 --> 00:10.165
We're going to go inside right now and start an interview.

00:11.367 --> 00:13.289
It is February 20th, 1990, 9.30 a.m.

00:13.549 --> 00:14.310
All right.

00:16.252 --> 00:17.394
We're working, Jeremy?

00:17.414 --> 00:17.854
We're working.

00:17.874 --> 00:18.235
I'm on.

00:18.715 --> 00:19.316
Okay.

00:19.897 --> 00:25.584
Aaron, I'm interested in how you, it's very important to me, you're from New Dutchman.

00:25.724 --> 00:30.470
You went to Hampshire College, which I guess is how you got here, right?

00:30.490 --> 00:32.552
Came back.

00:33.410 --> 00:38.475
But I'm wondering how you became, would you say you're obsessed, by the way?

00:38.975 --> 00:41.197
Is there any obsession with what you're doing?

00:41.277 --> 00:43.840
I've committed everything.

00:43.860 --> 00:50.967
At what point did the realization come that you were going to become a Johnny Appleseed, shall we say, of literature?

00:50.987 --> 00:53.569
I have to say, first of all, of course, I love books.

00:53.609 --> 00:55.451
I'm not primarily a bibliophile.

00:55.471 --> 01:00.315
My commitment is to Yiddish culture overall, to see a moment in history that is passing.

01:00.896 --> 01:02.978
So it's not just an obsession with books.

01:03.498 --> 01:08.163
with a literature and with a whole context.

01:09.144 --> 01:12.487
So the question is, how did it all start out?

01:13.408 --> 01:18.153
Well, but I want to know the motivation.

01:18.173 --> 01:19.794
I kind of know how you started.

01:19.895 --> 01:21.076
The story you know, right, okay.

01:21.176 --> 01:26.101
Yeah, but I'm wondering what's going, you know, you're going to college, you were studying what?

01:26.301 --> 01:30.265
Yeah, I mean, it goes all the way back to my first, when I first started out in college.

01:31.527 --> 01:33.629
I grew up very typical for my own generation.

01:33.649 --> 01:36.572
The story is very tied to the story of Yiddish and Yiddish culture.

01:36.592 --> 01:38.794
Just the books, as I said.

01:39.435 --> 01:44.781
Growing up, I heard Yiddish spoken as a language when I wasn't supposed to understand what the grandparents were talking about.

01:44.801 --> 01:47.203
That was very typical for my generation in my house.

01:47.363 --> 01:48.404
Yeah, right, right.

01:48.625 --> 01:50.507
Yeah, same thing, I'm sure, right?

01:50.527 --> 01:51.588
The same kind of dynamic.

01:51.608 --> 02:00.657
Of course, the difference always has been between Yiddish and other languages, only that at least Greece has a country, whereas Yiddish never had that.

02:00.940 --> 02:08.687
When Yiddish was lost among the immigrant population, it was lost, and there was no place where it was going.

02:08.707 --> 02:15.253
Eventually, I went on to Hampshire College, where I ended up studying modern Jewish history, studying with an anthropologist.

02:15.793 --> 02:17.475
Can I backtrack?

02:17.595 --> 02:18.616
Yeah.

02:18.636 --> 02:27.223
I did see one thing at one of the items that I read that your mother inculcated with.

02:27.243 --> 02:27.884
Oh, no.

02:27.904 --> 02:29.305
Yeah, you want to go back to that first?

02:29.325 --> 02:30.306
Well, I think that's important.

02:30.539 --> 02:34.044
There was a library being built, and she brought you to see it.

02:34.224 --> 02:34.544
Oh, yes.

02:34.564 --> 02:36.046
This is an important moment to me.

02:36.187 --> 02:36.507
Oh, yes.

02:36.567 --> 02:37.188
Go back to that.

02:37.208 --> 02:37.568
No, no, no.

02:37.588 --> 02:40.152
All my life, I... You're giving credit to your mother and your father.

02:40.272 --> 02:40.853
Oh, yes.

02:40.873 --> 02:41.253
No, no, no.

02:41.334 --> 02:43.577
I grew up in a home of which books were valued.

02:43.597 --> 02:46.861
I mean, my mother was just a great reader, as was my grandmother.

02:46.881 --> 02:52.509
My grandmother, my mom's mother, was an immigrant from Galicia from New York.

02:52.529 --> 02:56.153
Came to this country with... How do you spell Galicia?

02:56.334 --> 02:56.614
G-A-L-I-C-I-A.

02:56.932 --> 02:59.356
It was the southern part of the Austro-Lindary Empire.

02:59.436 --> 03:01.358
It's now the Soviet Ukraine.

03:01.379 --> 03:04.163
She came from near the city of Tarnapur.

03:04.203 --> 03:07.287
It's T-E-R-N-O-T-L-L.

03:07.708 --> 03:10.312
She came from a small village near there.

03:12.274 --> 03:15.018
And she was just an inveterate reader.

03:15.039 --> 03:15.920
She had eight kids.

03:15.960 --> 03:16.861
They were very poor.

03:16.901 --> 03:18.303
They had a really tough life.

03:18.343 --> 03:20.907
So she came to this country all alone when she was 16 years old.

03:21.848 --> 03:23.170
And yet she read all her life.

03:23.190 --> 03:24.272
And my mom tells me how.

03:24.623 --> 03:33.194
late at night up, she put all eight kids to bed and they were there in dirt poor, you know, with two rooms that were all crowded together, Providence and Fall River.

03:33.214 --> 03:36.178
They would, at night she would always read.

03:36.198 --> 03:37.119
She read in nature.

03:37.139 --> 03:37.880
She read everything.

03:37.900 --> 03:39.121
It didn't matter the language.

03:39.181 --> 03:41.584
How did they get to Fall River?

03:41.604 --> 03:44.969
She came into New York and I don't know, somebody knew something.

03:45.009 --> 03:46.310
I don't know, she ended up there.

03:46.330 --> 03:47.712
Yeah, she was married by the time she

03:47.843 --> 03:50.187
Do you know if they brought books with them?

03:50.207 --> 03:51.088
She probably did.

03:51.128 --> 03:51.769
She was a young girl.

03:51.789 --> 03:52.971
I mean, she came alone.

03:53.031 --> 03:53.852
I just don't know.

03:53.872 --> 03:56.777
The stories about books, as you're telling me about Jewish people.

03:56.797 --> 03:57.137
Oh, no, no.

03:57.177 --> 03:59.581
Books have always been so central to the culture.

03:59.681 --> 04:00.202
Oh, yeah.

04:00.523 --> 04:01.384
Well, just some of the things.

04:01.404 --> 04:05.791
I mean, that sense that books were treasures, I mean, was inculcated.

04:05.851 --> 04:08.214
I mean, nobody ever had to tell you this.

04:08.234 --> 04:09.236
You knew this from the beginning.

04:09.276 --> 04:11.780
No, but it was inherent in the culture in so many subtle ways.

04:11.800 --> 04:14.764
For example, when Jews drop a book on the floor, you always kiss the book.

04:14.885 --> 04:15.626
And that's just what you do.

04:15.746 --> 04:16.147
Is that right?

04:16.167 --> 04:16.467
Yeah, sure.

04:16.666 --> 04:18.428
you drop a book, you pick it up, and you kiss it.

04:18.448 --> 04:21.192
And that's just something that became so... Is there an expression for that?

04:21.672 --> 04:23.274
No, it's just something that's done.

04:23.675 --> 04:31.304
I mean, originally it's done because they're prayer books, right, or because they're religious books of one sort or another, but it's just something that applies to all books.

04:31.344 --> 04:44.040
I mean, even during the 60s, you know, when I was growing up and the war in Vietnam was going on, and there was a huge generational conflict, and when my brother and I used to argue with my father all the time about the war and what was happening politically, even during that period,

04:44.324 --> 04:50.172
We could have the most extreme anti-war literature in our room, and it was sitting on the floor, although my father might have hated the content of the books.

04:50.192 --> 04:52.055
He'd always put that book on the table.

04:52.095 --> 04:54.579
I mean, you would treat books with respect.

04:54.659 --> 04:56.401
That was always there, regardless of content.

04:56.521 --> 05:01.288
So where were you in terms of your family, or you said your brother, sisters?

05:01.308 --> 05:03.812
I'm in the middle of three boys.

05:03.832 --> 05:05.875
And your father and mother's names?

05:05.895 --> 05:07.917
My father is Sidney Lansky.

05:08.258 --> 05:08.819
S-I-D-N-E-Y.

05:09.119 --> 05:10.161
S-I-D-N-E-Y.

05:10.261 --> 05:11.182
He's a lawyer in New York.

05:11.302 --> 05:13.285
And my mom is Edith.

05:13.619 --> 05:17.144
Any problem at some point if I call them some folks?

05:17.244 --> 05:18.266
No, no problem at all.

05:18.286 --> 05:22.572
Yeah, my mother can talk to you at some length, because she's, to this day, is probably the biggest reader I know.

05:22.672 --> 05:24.475
Could you give me your phone number?

05:24.495 --> 05:29.242
Yeah, Edith Lansky, and her number's 508-758-6406.

05:30.083 --> 05:34.650
I'm going to be doing, this is going to be pretty thorough.

05:34.670 --> 05:35.591
Okay, that's great.

05:35.611 --> 05:38.676
This is not a one-day interview by... I understand that it goes on the next day.

05:38.716 --> 05:39.677
And it's long-term.

05:39.697 --> 05:39.818
Okay.

05:39.918 --> 05:42.141
The contract says, by the way, the book has to be done.

05:43.218 --> 05:45.942
March of 91, talking to my editor last week.

05:45.982 --> 05:47.924
She said she loves where I'm going.

05:47.944 --> 05:48.946
She loves the way it's going.

05:48.966 --> 05:50.708
She said, take all the time you need.

05:50.728 --> 05:51.088
Oh, that's nice.

05:51.108 --> 05:52.751
But I said, Becky, don't tell me this.

05:52.811 --> 05:53.732
I'm a journalist.

05:53.812 --> 05:55.054
I said, I need pressure.

05:55.374 --> 05:56.175
I need discipline.

05:56.295 --> 05:58.518
I intend to deliver the manuscript again here.

05:58.538 --> 06:03.224
My point is, I'll be back, and we're beginning now.

06:03.304 --> 06:03.965
So we begin.

06:04.526 --> 06:05.107
Okay.

06:05.748 --> 06:06.989
My mom can tell you some legs.

06:07.150 --> 06:12.837
She's very funny because she loves to read these Jewish novels, and the novels of Jewish immigrants, of which there are thousands of

06:13.525 --> 06:15.770
She lives in a small town.

06:15.830 --> 06:20.260
I grew up in New Bedford, but 15 years ago, my parents moved to Matapoiset.

06:20.280 --> 06:21.943
It's a small town close to Cape Cod.

06:22.885 --> 06:27.215
Matapoiset is a very small public library that's open a few days a week.

06:27.235 --> 06:31.163
And since my mom has to be one of the most avid readers in town,

06:31.582 --> 06:37.131
She puts in a great many of the orders at the local library, and people can ask for books, and the library will order them.

06:37.191 --> 06:41.818
So at this point, if you go into the Metapois public library, you'll see shelves and shelves of Jewish books there.

06:41.958 --> 06:44.141
In the town, it has about three Jews living there.

06:44.522 --> 06:50.571
I always say, you know, 300 years ago, someone's going to come into this library and wonder why they have the books that they have here.

06:51.693 --> 06:55.699
Yeah, that's great.

06:56.017 --> 06:58.319
Sorry, we have that, and so we have that.

06:58.339 --> 07:01.783
Yeah, but growing up, certainly, that respect for books is always present.

07:01.803 --> 07:04.205
I mean, my mom was the one who taught me how to read.

07:04.426 --> 07:10.892
So, you had to be able to write your name, just write your first name in order to get on high and free card in New Mexico.

07:10.912 --> 07:16.658
And so it was my mom who taught us how to do that, I'm sure, probably by the time I was four years older, so I was practicing and practicing.

07:17.219 --> 07:21.383
Until that time, my mother would take out books from the library for us, and then we'd take out books ourselves.

07:22.190 --> 07:23.732
We were quite young, still four or five.

07:23.772 --> 07:26.716
They built a new library, a branch library, near our house.

07:26.736 --> 07:30.461
We used to every day to see it being built and watch the books coming into it.

07:30.481 --> 07:30.621
Really?

07:30.641 --> 07:31.923
That sense of, every day.

07:31.943 --> 07:33.665
I had never heard a story like that.

07:33.725 --> 07:34.266
Oh, right.

07:34.446 --> 07:34.967
Every single day.

07:34.987 --> 07:37.410
Probably somebody would go to see a library going up.

07:37.430 --> 07:40.734
Every single day my mother would take me by the hand and bring me there to see that.

07:40.754 --> 07:42.256
So she really loved books, didn't she?

07:42.296 --> 07:46.662
Yeah, and I think books, I mean, for her and for her mother, I mean,

07:46.878 --> 07:55.607
not only was it something within Jewish tradition that books had great value, and we can talk about that later, but I mean, books had great intrinsic value altogether.

07:55.627 --> 08:04.537
Books were knowledge, books were culture, books were a chance to rise above the mundane, above the quotidian, and just see what existed.

08:04.657 --> 08:06.999
Do you know Saul Littleman and Tephs?

08:07.079 --> 08:08.120
I've heard of him.

08:08.160 --> 08:09.201
I've heard his name many times.

08:09.482 --> 08:12.425
He used to review from me, years before he became former.

08:12.485 --> 08:14.807
He used to say that these books are so precious.

08:14.887 --> 08:16.429
He said, you opened what one?

08:16.713 --> 08:19.817
He said, well, we can afford a book to get a book.

08:19.837 --> 08:22.500
I just can't tell you what a blessing it is.

08:22.740 --> 08:23.461
Oh, sure.

08:23.581 --> 08:24.963
It's the world.

08:25.063 --> 08:26.685
Everything there is.

08:26.705 --> 08:29.248
But it just seems to be a cultural thing.

08:29.288 --> 08:29.889
No question.

08:30.069 --> 08:31.931
I can talk a little bit about why I think that is.

08:32.012 --> 08:33.513
There are real roots in the culture.

08:33.553 --> 08:41.063
But the reality of it, I mean, that you can read about, the reality of it in my own life was how it came out in such subtle ways.

08:41.083 --> 08:43.125
I mean, even as a kid, I remember buying my first book.

08:44.084 --> 08:52.072
the first books that I would buy, you know, go down to the little bookstore and, oh, whatever, I don't remember, a book on Abraham Lincoln, whatever the books were that, you know, a six-year-old buy.

08:53.073 --> 08:55.695
I just wanted to make sure.

08:55.715 --> 08:57.277
Some points or something like that.

08:57.297 --> 08:58.358
Whatever it says you will buy.

08:58.378 --> 09:05.585
I can remember as a kid, you know, putting these near my bed or putting them on a shelf and just, you know, watching them with great pride.

09:05.605 --> 09:11.730
I mean, there was always a sense of, you know, books were knowledge, books were access to all there was in this program.

09:11.751 --> 09:13.332
So let's jump ahead now to college.

09:13.615 --> 09:14.937
Okay.

09:14.957 --> 09:18.442
And when you went to college, it was with the idea of doing what, did you think?

09:18.462 --> 09:19.164
Oh, I wasn't sure.

09:19.184 --> 09:20.285
I was interested in law.

09:20.405 --> 09:23.831
I was politically active.

09:24.171 --> 09:26.895
I was going to CO during the end of the draft.

09:26.915 --> 09:36.450
And when I went off to Hampshire, it wasn't clear what I was going to be studying, but my very first semester there, I ended up taking a course in the Nazi Holocaust.

09:37.392 --> 09:43.820
It was the first college course in the country on the Holocaust, organized the year before by a group of Hampshire students.

09:44.260 --> 09:57.596
And the people who were teaching the course, who were the greatest scholars from all over the world, who were inviting people like George Marcy, and Ralph Hilberg, and Eric Goldheim, they were the best people in the field who were coming to do the teaching.

09:57.616 --> 09:58.377
This was at what point?

09:58.597 --> 09:59.418
The University of Illinois?

09:59.438 --> 10:00.900
Yes, this was probably 73.

10:00.920 --> 10:02.041
So you were a freshman?

10:02.782 --> 10:05.205
Yeah, they don't call it that at Hampshire, but that's what I was.

10:05.438 --> 10:13.027
I had gotten out of high school a year, a quick high school hand in my junior year, and then spent a year cutting firewood and working as a gardener.

10:13.127 --> 10:13.427
Really?

10:13.447 --> 10:15.630
I had an old pickup truck and was just working for a year.

10:16.230 --> 10:17.872
But eventually went on to college.

10:18.753 --> 10:28.164
In the course of that, I realized that the Holocaust was fascinating, but it wasn't the Holocaust that was interesting to me per se so much as what was this culture that was destroyed.

10:28.184 --> 10:30.247
The Holocaust was a question of German history.

10:30.267 --> 10:30.927
How was it done?

10:30.947 --> 10:33.150
What was the process that was less interesting to me?

10:33.788 --> 10:34.709
But who were these Jews?

10:34.749 --> 10:35.590
What was this people?

10:36.231 --> 10:37.472
What was this world all about?

10:37.512 --> 10:40.976
That was something that was of a very great interest to it.

10:40.996 --> 10:47.262
As a matter of fact, the year before, in the course of working during the previous year, I had a chance to spend a fair amount of time with my grandfather.

10:47.903 --> 10:49.845
My grandfather, Tom, was already in his 80s.

10:50.986 --> 10:53.769
He was my mother's mother, also from Felicia.

10:54.350 --> 11:00.977
An old Jewish guy who'd worked all his life as a junk man, picking up scraps and farms around the countryside of Rhode Island.

11:01.683 --> 11:05.226
And so I had a chance to, I started doing a little junkies myself.

11:05.246 --> 11:05.747
I would go around.

11:05.767 --> 11:09.170
So he would go with me at work for 15 or 20 years since his first heart attack.

11:09.871 --> 11:16.897
And sitting in the truck with him, I had a chance to imbibe some of his values in a way that I probably wouldn't have been exposed to otherwise.

11:17.378 --> 11:18.539
And of course, I loved the books.

11:18.639 --> 11:19.240
I loved the learning.

11:19.280 --> 11:22.583
It was so central to everything that he was and everything he believed in.

11:22.603 --> 11:26.506
And he was just, day after day in the truck, he was able to impart that to me.

11:27.067 --> 11:29.209
And I guess even then I was able to understand that

11:29.712 --> 11:42.285
But there was something in this culture, in Jewish culture, that came out of Eastern Europe that was very different from the mainstream culture that was being, you know, given to, you know, what the mainstream culture had to offer me.

11:42.865 --> 11:46.889
You know, it was kind of just a visceral sense of something there that spoke to me.

11:46.969 --> 11:51.714
When I got to college, started studying the Holocaust, suddenly I began, well, who was this people?

11:51.794 --> 11:52.815
Who were these people?

11:52.855 --> 11:54.737
Why was my grandfather the way he was?

11:54.817 --> 11:58.201
Why was he so utterly different from most Americans that I knew?

11:58.241 --> 11:59.702
What was this world all about?

12:00.779 --> 12:07.650
So I went to the person who was the faculty advisor for the course, was the dean of social science at Hampshire, Leonard Glick.

12:08.692 --> 12:13.420
Leonard was an anthropologist, he was also a physician by training.

12:13.440 --> 12:13.680
Interesting.

12:13.700 --> 12:14.922
What did you do about medicine?

12:14.942 --> 12:21.613
Yeah, he was a physician by training, became an anthropologist, and then started, I can give you his number, he's a very instrumental.

12:21.814 --> 12:22.635
Okay, yeah.

12:23.003 --> 12:26.547
Why don't you do that right now?

12:26.567 --> 12:27.248
Yeah, G-L-I-C-K.

12:27.268 --> 12:29.811
Actually, yeah, I'm sure it's 549-4600.

12:29.831 --> 12:30.773
549-4600.

12:30.793 --> 12:37.040
Yeah, his home number is 508-544-544-7141.

12:37.141 --> 12:52.099
Okay, so he was an anthropologist.

12:52.552 --> 12:55.054
was also beginning to ask the same questions as I was.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.075
Who were these people?

12:56.095 --> 12:58.157
What was this world all about?

12:58.177 --> 13:04.163
So I had what has to be the most fortunate of all learning experiences that I was able to learn alongside my teacher.

13:04.183 --> 13:06.645
Here was a man who was a physician.

13:06.665 --> 13:09.108
Is this recorded anywhere, by the way?

13:09.608 --> 13:13.172
Yeah, I'm writing a book right now.

13:13.752 --> 13:17.396
It was the most fortunate of all experiences.

13:18.337 --> 13:19.858
A chance to learn a lot.

13:20.159 --> 13:21.340
He might have been a physician.

13:21.400 --> 13:23.602
He'd been a psychiatrist.

13:23.622 --> 13:27.766
He gave Elvis Presley his induction physical when he was wrapped into the air force.

13:27.986 --> 13:30.128
He was once in the front page of all the papers.

13:30.148 --> 13:33.771
So he was not chronologically a contemporary of this.

13:33.791 --> 13:35.213
He had been in his 40s or 50s.

13:35.233 --> 13:40.297
Yeah, and then he just turned 60, so he had been in his 40s.

13:41.318 --> 13:45.983
But the system in Hampshire, he had a Hampshire area that was a very new school then.

13:46.003 --> 13:47.584
It was based upon the premise of Lynch.

13:48.087 --> 13:49.248
non-traditional learning.

13:49.268 --> 13:54.033
The idea that it once follows one interest is a free intellectual exploration.

13:54.594 --> 13:57.016
Which works out here in Western Massachusetts.

13:57.136 --> 13:58.658
I got a great education out of it.

13:58.678 --> 13:59.939
Really, it was great for me.

13:59.999 --> 14:03.082
At the time, we used to talk about modes of inquiry.

14:03.102 --> 14:04.684
There wasn't a lot we should give the students.

14:04.704 --> 14:08.908
It was to teach them how to go about exploring a subject, how to let the students learn on their own.

14:09.529 --> 14:12.231
So I went to a lot less than the time interested in learning Jewish history.

14:12.251 --> 14:14.874
And I said, he was also interested in the same subject at the same time.

14:15.955 --> 14:17.757
So I was really able to learn alongside

14:18.344 --> 14:23.170
which meant that my education wasn't something that someone taught me as a process of discovering.

14:23.190 --> 14:25.512
As you know, when you discover things, you know them.

14:27.134 --> 14:28.656
What kinds of things did you learn together?

14:28.696 --> 14:30.218
Did you get me in a couple of years?

14:30.238 --> 14:37.186
Yeah, first of all, the time, the first field of Jewish studies was very different, but Jewish studies wasn't even called, and the field was called Judaic studies.

14:37.967 --> 14:40.229
Judaic means the study of Judaism.

14:40.249 --> 14:43.313
Right, the study of religion, the study of ideas, theology.

14:43.333 --> 14:45.195
But the study of Jewish studies, or the study

14:46.694 --> 14:47.915
how they lived their lives.

14:47.955 --> 14:49.196
This was more of a secular interest.

14:49.997 --> 14:56.263
Well, I guess not exactly, only in the sense that, of course, culture is all embracing, all encompassing.

14:56.283 --> 14:57.944
But it was more than just intellectual things.

14:57.964 --> 14:59.185
It was a history of ideas.

14:59.285 --> 15:00.526
Yeah, more than just theology.

15:00.546 --> 15:01.888
It was a history of ideas.

15:01.908 --> 15:03.129
It was a social history.

15:03.149 --> 15:05.771
It was a history of how people actually live.

15:05.791 --> 15:14.659
Well, at the time, I took a few courses, a so-called religious studies courses, mostly taught by non-Jewish professors.

15:15.162 --> 15:17.165
mostly, you know, studies of Old Testament.

15:17.265 --> 15:22.752
It had nothing to do with, oh God, you know, some Jew came in here, you know, eating an onion in the back of the room.

15:22.772 --> 15:24.494
I can't imagine what these guys would think about it.

15:24.574 --> 15:30.401
It's not what they would particularly, you know, there was something Jewish that they weren't very, they weren't teaching, obviously.

15:31.803 --> 15:37.871
But when I was able to begin exploring more, let's look at how these people lived their lives.

15:37.891 --> 15:45.000
So I used to go over to the UMass library and I'd go over there often and spend many, many hours there and just walk through the stacks and the areas

15:45.655 --> 15:53.647
DS was the subject area, you know, the heading for social historical books and Jewish history.

15:53.668 --> 15:57.914
And I would walk through and just pull books off the shelf at random and try to figure out who was who and what was what.

15:57.934 --> 15:59.457
It was a whole universe.

15:59.577 --> 16:00.458
And I knew very little.

16:00.478 --> 16:04.244
I didn't know much more education than you read from, you know, exploring the whole world.

16:04.925 --> 16:10.193
The reason I was taking course in history and other things to fill in the background for all this.

16:10.213 --> 16:11.916
One day I came across a work.

16:12.318 --> 16:25.314
published in 1916 in Philadelphia, the Jewish Publication Society, called The History of the Jews in Russia and Poland, by a historian named Simon Dubnow, B-U-B-N-O-W.

16:25.335 --> 16:26.376
B-U-B-N-O-W.

16:26.436 --> 16:27.878
Simon, S-M-O-W.

16:27.978 --> 16:32.824
He was a Russian Jewish historian, probably the preeminent Jewish historian of the early 20th century.

16:33.344 --> 16:43.118
and really the founder of modern Jewish historiography, the first to really, you know, what he called a sociological view of Jewish history, like the history of Jews.

16:43.959 --> 16:46.883
Well, I didn't know this at the time how central books were.

16:46.983 --> 16:49.206
I just found these old green books that were kind of dusty there.

16:49.226 --> 16:51.329
I didn't know what it was checked out in many, many years.

16:51.349 --> 16:54.834
And I brought them back and started reading, and I went to London.

16:54.854 --> 16:56.296
I think these books were poor.

16:56.677 --> 16:58.559
I said, well, take a look at them.

16:58.579 --> 17:00.402
I said, yes, these are things that I think they are.

17:00.502 --> 17:01.123
And of course, he knew how to

17:01.441 --> 17:02.342
be critical about .

17:02.362 --> 17:11.734
And I found reference works and began reading about this and realized I had stumbled across the central historian of the early 20th century.

17:11.754 --> 17:13.816
And that was a profound intellectual .

17:14.117 --> 17:16.059
And you found it in a library.

17:16.079 --> 17:18.802
Yeah, just walking through the staff, just by accident.

17:18.962 --> 17:19.884
That makes sense.

17:20.244 --> 17:20.825
Yeah, of course.

17:20.865 --> 17:22.146
The great things about books.

17:22.166 --> 17:25.591
Yeah, education is ultimately a process of discovery.

17:25.691 --> 17:28.674
Anyway, that was a big influence.

17:28.694 --> 17:30.857
And the more I did that, the more I began looking at

17:31.310 --> 17:34.974
but not Judaism or Jews, the more I began to try to understand who these people were.

17:35.634 --> 17:42.121
I was already studying Hebrew and German at the time, which was a prescribed language for Jewish studies students.

17:42.141 --> 17:53.011
And at the time, I said, you know, the more I studied, the more I realized that for the last thousand years, roughly, you know, between three, four, almost 80% of the world's Jews for the last thousand years had spoken Yiddish.

17:54.053 --> 17:58.617
And although Yiddish wasn't part of a curriculum for any Jewish studies students at the time, I said, you know, this is really

17:59.272 --> 18:05.639
If I'm going to understand who these people were and how they lived their lives, clearly I need to understand their experience in its own time.

18:05.659 --> 18:08.362
Did you speak Yiddish in this time?

18:08.382 --> 18:08.502
No.

18:08.522 --> 18:10.184
No, I spoke to you.

18:10.204 --> 18:10.584
In words.

18:10.604 --> 18:15.710
No, but I wasn't supposed to know.

18:16.450 --> 18:19.614
So I decided it was time to learn Yiddish in order to handle it.

18:19.634 --> 18:20.935
Really, I was only interested in history.

18:21.055 --> 18:21.996
You had a direction then.

18:22.357 --> 18:26.241
You didn't stumble into this, is what I can see.

18:26.558 --> 18:29.162
It's focused, but it's a great focus.

18:29.202 --> 18:31.204
Well, I found the focus.

18:31.225 --> 18:33.588
I mean, that wasn't the focus that was given to me.

18:33.608 --> 18:35.671
The focus was given to me with Old Testament studies.

18:35.691 --> 18:36.832
Well, you derived the focus, though.

18:36.852 --> 18:38.134
Yeah, it was obvious to me.

18:38.194 --> 18:40.838
I think it just split my own sensibilities.

18:43.361 --> 18:45.785
So I decided to start studying eulich.

18:45.805 --> 18:48.889
There was no course off of birth.

18:49.410 --> 18:51.072
Eulich was taught almost nowhere.

18:51.453 --> 18:52.414
Was it spoken at home?

18:53.221 --> 18:55.384
Did your parents?

18:55.584 --> 18:57.787
No, my grandparents don't get it.

18:57.868 --> 19:02.895
And it stopped even to dissipate even with their parents.

19:03.195 --> 19:04.417
My mother still could speak.

19:04.437 --> 19:07.361
It was somewhat familiar.

19:07.401 --> 19:10.926
Her oldest district was much more familiar.

19:12.828 --> 19:17.495
So finally, if I'm a professor, I could ask me around here, who we study with.

19:17.515 --> 19:20.359
And there was one other student at Hampshire that was interested in learning with me.

19:21.520 --> 19:27.369
We finally found a professor at the University of Massachusetts .

19:27.389 --> 19:29.512
He was himself a chapter for your book.

19:29.532 --> 19:37.463
He was an extraordinary, he was one of the discoveries of Leonardo da Vinci manuscripts in the career that became the honor of Leonardo.

19:37.483 --> 19:38.865
He's a real character.

19:38.946 --> 19:42.651
He's retired now.

19:43.525 --> 20:12.537
He's a great story in his own right, but he was in there with a great love of books and learning at all levels, and he spoke about 20 languages, all of which he had learned only to read literature.

20:13.748 --> 20:16.150
He said, have you ever read Don Quixote?

20:16.411 --> 20:18.332
He said, well, no, no, not exactly.

20:18.352 --> 20:19.053
I didn't think so.

20:19.173 --> 20:21.035
After all, you can't read it without medieval Spanish.

20:21.055 --> 20:22.697
I said, well, I could have read a translation.

20:23.257 --> 20:24.158
He says, translation?

20:24.178 --> 20:25.079
What the hell is that?

20:25.119 --> 20:30.164
You know, he had this idea that you could only read a word in its original language, and whenever he wanted to read a book.

20:30.204 --> 20:32.766
When he wants to read a book, he goes, I mean, there's the language.

20:32.846 --> 20:36.650
He taught himself Italian, so he could illustrate, you know, Dante.

20:36.750 --> 20:37.351
Right.

20:37.371 --> 20:39.433
I mean, he didn't want to read a translation.

20:39.493 --> 20:41.294
Let's just repeat it.

20:41.895 --> 20:42.996
Nerds languages to read books.

20:43.381 --> 20:45.264
He just finished learning Turkish last year.

20:45.284 --> 20:47.066
I think he's working on Japanese now.

20:47.346 --> 20:48.248
That is a good story now.

20:48.808 --> 20:52.393
Yeah, he's a man that's coming in his late 60s now.

20:52.413 --> 20:53.755
He just continues to study.

20:53.775 --> 20:55.117
It's what he does for the same place.

20:55.137 --> 20:55.858
So you went to him.

20:56.419 --> 21:05.391
Yeah, and by the time he decided, as a volunteer, he was going to teach a Yiddish class at the university, which he taught for one semester.

21:05.411 --> 21:07.414
And the kids all came to the class.

21:07.816 --> 21:11.940
a language requirement there, and I guess everyone thought somehow Yiddish would be easier.

21:11.960 --> 21:14.222
And there must have been 25 students to start up.

21:14.423 --> 21:16.044
Yeah, 25, isn't that spectacular?

21:16.084 --> 21:17.546
Probably the only Yiddish course?

21:18.046 --> 21:18.807
Well, now there are many.

21:18.927 --> 21:20.529
Now there are over six of the universities.

21:20.549 --> 21:21.890
But then it was one of a few.

21:22.170 --> 21:24.913
I'm sure there were one or two in New York.

21:24.953 --> 21:25.553
Yeah, there were a few.

21:25.573 --> 21:26.514
Brandeis was teaching already.

21:26.534 --> 21:27.055
Brandeis would have.

21:27.095 --> 21:27.896
Yeah.

21:28.336 --> 21:29.517
But it's limited.

21:29.537 --> 21:31.479
It was limited to that.

21:31.499 --> 21:31.840
And he taught us.

21:32.020 --> 21:34.262
And I say the class, and I remember he'd come into classes

21:34.833 --> 21:38.319
He was a very old-fashioned kind of teacher, very, you know, grammatical in his approach.

21:38.339 --> 21:41.966
Suited me fine, but most of his students were a bit like that.

21:43.228 --> 21:50.040
And one he bangs on the table and says, well, just because your grandmother spoke Yiddish, don't think you're going to learn the goddamn language by osmosis, you know?

21:51.067 --> 21:53.631
You have to learn the language, the language like any other.

21:53.651 --> 21:58.679
Well, the upshot of that was by the end of the first semester, out of 25 students, 23 had failed the course.

21:58.779 --> 22:01.142
Yeah, because no one did anything.

22:01.242 --> 22:04.107
You know, they didn't realize there really was a language.

22:04.267 --> 22:07.011
Yeah, he was doing this on a volunteer basis.

22:07.051 --> 22:10.817
He said, look, these kids don't want to learn the hell with you, and that was the end of the class.

22:10.837 --> 22:11.578
I respect him for that.

22:11.598 --> 22:14.282
Yeah, so he taught cancer the rest of the year.

22:14.302 --> 22:18.829
And so a friend of mine from Hampshire and I, along with one student from UMass, went to him and said, look,

22:19.703 --> 22:20.544
Well, we're enjoying it.

22:20.564 --> 22:21.966
Yeah, well, you teach us, you know.

22:22.887 --> 22:23.829
So he thought about it.

22:24.029 --> 22:24.229
All right.

22:24.530 --> 22:25.191
He says, I'll teach you.

22:25.211 --> 22:26.312
He's kind of a rough guy.

22:26.372 --> 22:26.693
I'll teach you.

22:26.713 --> 22:28.475
He says, we're going to make a few things crazy.

22:28.495 --> 22:30.058
I want you to work like hell.

22:30.078 --> 22:31.560
You're always prepared before class.

22:31.580 --> 22:32.902
You know, we're going to move very fast.

22:33.062 --> 22:38.349
And the last part of the deal was that he would teach us after hours at five or six o'clock one day.

22:38.369 --> 22:40.152
This is a dedicated teacher.

22:40.292 --> 22:40.612
Oh, yeah.

22:40.673 --> 22:42.235
He's one of the best teachers I ever had.

22:42.375 --> 22:43.316
Only a teacher would do this.

22:43.757 --> 22:44.718
I've learned so much with him.

22:44.738 --> 22:46.381
I can't begin to tell you.

22:46.401 --> 22:47.382
I mean, for two years,

22:47.767 --> 22:49.790
We went to him one day a week for two years.

22:50.431 --> 22:53.014
We sat with him for three or four hours each time.

22:53.034 --> 22:57.741
We used to bring with us a bottle of wine and a loaf of homemade bread, one of the guys who was a good bread maker.

22:57.761 --> 23:00.525
And as long as that lasted, we'd learn every week.

23:00.545 --> 23:01.266
What did he look like?

23:01.947 --> 23:03.809
It was quite a bit like Karl Marx, actually.

23:03.829 --> 23:05.271
Big white beer, white hair.

23:05.812 --> 23:06.974
Now, pick us.

23:07.034 --> 23:07.935
What is that?

23:08.692 --> 23:13.919
What was his first language?

23:14.059 --> 23:16.362
He was born in New York.

23:16.522 --> 23:17.544
I'm a Jewish guy.

23:17.584 --> 23:19.206
Born in New York, in Brooklyn.

23:19.226 --> 23:21.689
He spoke English as a kid.

23:21.709 --> 23:23.712
He knew his English.

23:23.952 --> 23:25.695
Bull knows football or whatever.

23:26.075 --> 23:30.241
Of the 20 languages, this was his first language.

23:30.261 --> 23:31.402
He spoke quite well.

23:31.422 --> 23:36.589
Do you think he knew that he was performing a function?

23:37.008 --> 23:42.974
the same kind of function you're performing with books on an individual basis?

23:43.054 --> 23:46.857
Passing on something which is in danger of disappearing?

23:47.038 --> 23:48.919
Jules has a genuine love of learning.

23:48.939 --> 23:51.021
It has an absolute thing unto itself.

23:51.682 --> 23:59.650
According to Jewish tradition, Jewish tradition talks about Torah Lishma, meaning learning for its own sake, the highest level of learning.

24:00.230 --> 24:00.851
How would you spell that?

24:00.871 --> 24:05.275
Torah, T-O-R-I-H, and then L-apostrophe S-H-M-A.

24:05.295 --> 24:05.395
Okay.

24:05.729 --> 24:08.312
Otherwise, I'll have to cry you at some point.

24:08.612 --> 24:10.173
That's right.

24:10.674 --> 24:11.314
Yeah.

24:11.334 --> 24:21.144
The point of it is that the highest level of learning is not to learn to become a mechanic, or learn to become an engineer, or learn to become a lawyer, but you learn just for the sheer love of learning, for the sheer power of learning.

24:21.164 --> 24:22.285
And that's what Jules had.

24:22.325 --> 24:25.929
He taught us more than just Yiddish, and he gave me a whole education in those times.

24:26.770 --> 24:33.997
Everything that would come up, and oftentimes we'd say, well, how the hell can I teach you kids Yiddish when you don't even speak English?

24:34.017 --> 24:35.398
And he would teach us everything.

24:35.902 --> 24:39.708
Growing up in America at the time, I think you just don't get a lot of education.

24:39.728 --> 24:45.676
So you've had, from what I can see so far, three exceedingly influential people in your life.

24:45.696 --> 24:47.579
Your mother, of course.

24:47.800 --> 24:47.960
Yeah.

24:48.601 --> 24:49.903
Well, yeah, I've been very blessed.

24:49.923 --> 24:50.884
I've had three great teachers.

24:50.904 --> 24:54.670
Lick, and now... Yeah, Leonard Lick, and Jules Peek, because they're my teacher in graduate school.

24:54.750 --> 24:55.891
I have three great teachers in my life.

24:56.112 --> 25:00.438
Which is probably the greatest blessing they've ever given to me.

25:00.458 --> 25:03.363
If I was lucky with anything in my life, it was great.

25:03.383 --> 25:03.883
And teachers.

25:04.404 --> 25:05.065
Yeah, three great teachers.

25:05.500 --> 25:06.641
It was just luck.

25:07.041 --> 25:07.482
So go ahead.

25:08.363 --> 25:11.265
Anyways, Jules started teaching us.

25:11.325 --> 25:13.447
The grammar book was supposed to be a two-year course.

25:13.467 --> 25:14.909
I think we did it in about a month.

25:14.929 --> 25:16.550
Sorry, let's just get through the goddamn grammar.

25:16.570 --> 25:17.812
We raced through the book.

25:17.832 --> 25:18.652
We worked very hard on it.

25:18.692 --> 25:20.954
Now, were you handling your other load of work?

25:20.975 --> 25:21.955
Oh, yeah.

25:22.015 --> 25:23.837
Well, Hampshire was an open curriculum.

25:23.857 --> 25:24.538
You know, just what I was doing.

25:24.558 --> 25:25.599
So I'm sure they liked this.

25:26.039 --> 25:26.440
Of course.

25:26.520 --> 25:28.522
I forget the whole idea.

25:28.542 --> 25:29.222
Of course.

25:29.262 --> 25:30.243
Yeah, I was learning.

25:30.804 --> 25:33.246
At the end, there were four of us in the class, myself,

25:33.412 --> 25:39.017
The two other Hampshire students and one student from the University, where four of us used to get together with George each week.

25:39.037 --> 25:44.462
And after we raced through the Grammar's Hour, I said, please, you want to spend your life studying grammar or you want to read literature?

25:44.482 --> 25:48.205
You know, he wasn't always, he was the exact opposite of the way language is taught now.

25:48.225 --> 25:53.870
There's no tapes, no language labs, no videos, there was no, no nonsense.

25:53.890 --> 25:59.896
When I went to college, we had tapes, and that's in the early 60s.

25:59.916 --> 26:01.377
He was strictly

26:02.167 --> 26:03.248
You want to learn to learn it.

26:03.368 --> 26:04.930
His idea of learning was you read.

26:05.130 --> 26:06.371
You learn to read literature.

26:06.992 --> 26:09.915
I remember he said, I'm going to find the hardest goddamn book I could find.

26:10.015 --> 26:22.488
He found the book by Isaac Bersheva Singer called The Satan and Goray, G-O-R-A-Y, which was a novel set in the 17th century, a difficult novel written in a very difficult Yiddish.

26:22.508 --> 26:26.091
He thought we should just start out with something tough and fight our way through it.

26:26.111 --> 26:26.972
So we used to sit around.

26:27.052 --> 26:28.554
We got copies of the book from Israel.

26:28.594 --> 26:30.756
That was one of the few books that was available.

26:31.799 --> 26:35.023
That's the first step ever once in the book we used.

26:35.043 --> 26:38.127
And we'd start sitting down, and we'd go around in a circle.

26:39.068 --> 26:47.179
There was one guy who always sat on his right, a guy named Jack, called Yanko, and he'd say, New Yanko, lay in a vessel, read a little.

26:47.259 --> 26:48.520
And that's how we started every class.

26:48.540 --> 26:49.241
And we'd go around.

26:49.782 --> 26:54.588
Whatever it is before class, we would work at home together, preparing the test.

26:54.608 --> 26:57.131
And when we first started, we had to look up every single word, of course.

26:57.151 --> 26:57.892
We didn't know anything.

26:58.693 --> 26:59.935
We got a little easier as time went on.

26:59.955 --> 27:01.637
We'd underline the word in the dictionary.

27:02.090 --> 27:04.532
But the second time you looked at the word, you usually knew it.

27:04.572 --> 27:06.094
The very time you always knew it.

27:06.114 --> 27:06.994
So you need to start to learn.

27:07.575 --> 27:10.958
And the first few weeks, we were going for maybe a sentence or two sentences a week.

27:11.558 --> 27:14.821
And towards the end, we were doing many pages a week.

27:14.921 --> 27:15.602
Word by word.

27:15.622 --> 27:17.443
But word by word, line by line.

27:17.463 --> 27:18.845
We'd read a line out loud and translate.

27:18.865 --> 27:19.886
Read a line out loud and translate.

27:19.906 --> 27:21.027
My daughter's in Greek school.

27:22.448 --> 27:23.008
Really?

27:23.028 --> 27:24.249
Just three days a week.

27:24.289 --> 27:25.651
Like an afternoon school.

27:25.671 --> 27:26.411
Yeah, right after school.

27:26.431 --> 27:26.992
And they're little.

27:27.112 --> 27:29.074
I mean, you know, seven or eight.

27:29.094 --> 27:30.075
That's a good time to do it.

27:30.695 --> 27:31.776
They go and they love it.

27:32.026 --> 27:33.008
I've got two daughters.

27:33.048 --> 27:34.510
Do you speak?

27:35.211 --> 27:38.516
You know, more than a lot of people realize.

27:38.536 --> 27:39.277
No, I don't speak.

27:39.297 --> 27:40.239
I kind of understand.

27:40.259 --> 27:41.361
My wife speaks.

27:41.381 --> 27:45.687
I happen to have a very Greek woman.

27:45.707 --> 27:46.489
It's a coincidence.

27:47.370 --> 27:48.191
And she speaks?

27:48.211 --> 27:49.974
She speaks.

27:50.775 --> 27:51.637
That's nice.

27:51.677 --> 27:52.578
I'm very pleased.

27:53.840 --> 27:55.503
It's a word.

27:55.543 --> 27:57.706
It's a word.

27:58.467 --> 28:00.210
My little wife reads Greek.

28:00.680 --> 28:03.524
I've got a seven-year-old daughter who can do two things that I can't do.

28:03.604 --> 28:04.285
Absolutely.

28:04.305 --> 28:06.468
She can read Greek, and she can read music.

28:06.528 --> 28:10.173
I can't read music, and I can't read Greek.

28:10.574 --> 28:14.739
I'm almost 40 years old.

28:14.960 --> 28:17.864
You can do two things that I can't do.

28:17.884 --> 28:18.605
But anyway, go ahead.

28:18.625 --> 28:19.586
Okay, so I'll continue.

28:19.626 --> 28:21.088
We read.

28:21.989 --> 28:28.358
In the course of all that, I was continuing my work at Hampshire, continuing to study Jewish history, and I was also teaching by them as well.

28:29.266 --> 28:32.409
And I ended up using Yiddish sources to write my undergraduate thesis.

28:33.711 --> 28:38.396
And by that point, I was beginning to understand more and more about Yiddish literature as well.

28:39.217 --> 28:43.041
About, you know, the estimate is one half of 1% of all Yiddish books.

28:44.663 --> 28:45.464
Just a check.

28:45.484 --> 28:48.607
Yeah, one half of 1% of all Yiddish books have been translated into English.

28:48.868 --> 28:50.189
One half of 1%.

28:50.229 --> 28:51.971
Yeah, I think it's actually less than that.

28:52.031 --> 28:53.553
I guess the estimate is usually given up.

28:54.173 --> 28:57.237
The more I see, the more I think it is probably considerably less than that.

28:57.257 --> 28:58.378
Most of them have been published

28:58.831 --> 29:04.059
Yeah, it's a modern literature, Yiddish, you know, 125 life years.

29:04.079 --> 29:05.442
That's right, exactly, exactly.

29:05.502 --> 29:07.605
It doesn't begin until the 1860s, really.

29:08.106 --> 29:10.670
It begins at a time when the old Jewish world breaks down.

29:11.051 --> 29:23.691
As long as the old traditional Jewish world has remained intact, Jews spent their time learning Torah, Talmud, Ra within it, and not, they didn't write in Yiddish, which was the Vernashtava, you spent your time with scholarship.

29:24.548 --> 29:35.727
When the old world began to break down, suddenly Jews had to figure out what it meant to live as a Jew in the modern world, and they drew upon this vernacular, which represented everyday Jewish experience, to create a whole new literature.

29:36.529 --> 29:39.234
And it was from that that Jewish literature came first and forth.

29:39.254 --> 29:43.461
I can give you a lot of information on the history of Jewish literature later.

29:43.802 --> 29:48.109
In any event, it's a modern literature, an inherently sect of the literature, an inherently modern literature.

29:48.494 --> 29:50.816
And really its primary issue is what does it mean?

29:50.936 --> 29:52.698
What is Jewishness in the modern context?

29:52.718 --> 30:02.286
So it's both ethnographic and reconstructing or documenting the world which had come before, and it's also laying the foundation for the world which will follow.

30:02.306 --> 30:04.348
Well, that was that.

30:04.488 --> 30:07.111
Finally finished with Jules, finally graduated from Hampshire.

30:07.831 --> 30:10.133
And I decided I would go on to graduate school.

30:10.273 --> 30:10.494
Graduated?

30:10.514 --> 30:11.394
About when?

30:11.414 --> 30:13.436
I finished him from December 76.

30:13.556 --> 30:14.677
Okay.

30:14.697 --> 30:17.640
Decided I would go on to graduate school in the fall.

30:18.093 --> 30:21.097
I decided to go to McGill, and there was a great teacher, a woman.

30:21.117 --> 30:26.083
I'd read a book by her, and I was very impressed with this book, and decided this was the person I wanted to study with.

30:26.103 --> 30:26.504
What was the book?

30:26.524 --> 30:27.385
What was his teacher?

30:27.405 --> 30:33.693
The woman's name is Ruth Wisse, W-I-S-S-E, and she wrote a book called The Shlemiel is Modern Hero, a Keep of Yiddish Literature.

30:33.713 --> 30:34.974
I'll look it up with Harvard.

30:34.994 --> 30:37.918
Yeah, it's a small little book from the University of Chicago.

30:37.938 --> 30:42.204
Anyway, the book made a big impression on that, so this is the person I wanted to study with.

30:42.224 --> 30:44.086
Let me write it down, because it might be a laboratory transcript.

30:44.106 --> 30:45.167
It says Ruth?

30:45.187 --> 30:46.729
Ruth Wisse, W-I-S-S-E.

30:47.150 --> 30:47.290
Uh-huh.

30:47.557 --> 30:52.343
S-C-H-L-E-M-I-E-L.

30:52.503 --> 31:00.493
Yeah, Schlemiel.

31:01.214 --> 31:01.695
Right.

31:01.935 --> 31:02.536
W-I-S-S-E.

31:02.676 --> 31:02.917
Right.

31:03.277 --> 31:06.561
She was a major influence.

31:06.581 --> 31:11.207
I can give you her a number.

31:11.387 --> 31:13.730
I do research quite thoroughly.

31:14.391 --> 31:17.395
She's probably the best scholar of British literature around today.

31:19.265 --> 31:21.709
It's 514-482-874-874.

31:21.809 --> 31:24.334
That's in my field?

31:24.895 --> 31:26.557
Yeah, that's in my field.

31:26.698 --> 31:29.883
Okay.

31:29.903 --> 31:32.768
Well, Ruth, is we still rowing it?

31:32.788 --> 31:33.329
Yep.

31:33.409 --> 31:34.130
Oh, yeah.

31:34.150 --> 31:34.711
That's well.

31:34.731 --> 31:35.873
It's just very slow.

31:35.893 --> 31:35.993
Okay.

31:36.014 --> 31:36.875
An hour on each side.

31:36.895 --> 31:37.857
No, that's great.

31:38.057 --> 31:41.383
So eventually I went on to graduate school.

31:41.443 --> 31:42.184
Before I did that,

31:42.822 --> 31:47.851
I headed off to, I had six months in jail, and I've been working, you know, all through college.

31:47.871 --> 31:50.235
I figured I would take some time off and head out to California.

31:50.255 --> 31:54.141
I had a deal at the time where you could go cross-country on the Greyhound for $49.

31:54.161 --> 32:00.813
I took the Greyhound cross-country, ended up out in San Francisco, and lived in an apartment with a friend there.

32:00.833 --> 32:05.100
And finally, after a number of different jobs, got myself a physician.

32:05.519 --> 32:09.382
at a Jewish library in Berkeley.

32:10.683 --> 32:15.748
My job was an unusual one.

32:16.348 --> 32:22.093
The museum was operating on a really shoestring project.

32:22.153 --> 32:25.056
It was called the Judah Magnes Museum.

32:25.076 --> 32:28.359
It's called the Jewish Museum of the West.

32:29.100 --> 32:30.601
Judah, J-U-D-A-H.

32:32.162 --> 32:35.425
J-U-D-A-H, first name then, M-A-G-N-E-S.

32:35.894 --> 32:36.234
Yeah.

32:36.315 --> 32:37.196
Still there?

32:37.216 --> 32:39.459
Yeah.

32:39.479 --> 32:42.463
When I got there, they had a carriage house up behind the building.

32:42.483 --> 32:45.808
There was a library in the basement of the museum.

32:45.908 --> 32:51.555
A pretty large library, I'm guessing, maybe 15,000, 20,000 volumes.

32:51.575 --> 32:59.787
And there was a librarian there who was from Kurdistan, you know, in the Ransom, I guess now.

32:59.807 --> 33:02.931
And, you know, , his first language was Aramaic.

33:03.417 --> 33:05.379
She had no Yiddish tradition.

33:05.399 --> 33:06.640
It was a very ancient language.

33:06.660 --> 33:07.101
I know.

33:07.121 --> 33:08.062
I've got a man.

33:08.362 --> 33:08.602
Yeah.

33:09.163 --> 33:20.374
So Bacha was the librarian, and they had a carriage house out behind the building, behind the main building, an old carriage house, which was filled to the rafters with probably about 10,000 Yiddish books.

33:21.415 --> 33:24.398
Now, that was the first time I'd ever seen large numbers of Yiddish books before.

33:24.498 --> 33:28.102
Even in college, we needed Yiddish books for our studies.

33:28.122 --> 33:31.585
We used to go down to New York, the old Lower East Side, which was still pretty Jewish then.

33:31.953 --> 33:37.320
And I'd go around to old Jewish bookstores there and try to find books, but rarely could find what we needed.

33:37.380 --> 33:39.342
I mean, most of the books were out, and almost all of them.

33:39.463 --> 33:40.264
Well, this is interesting.

33:40.284 --> 33:43.448
You see, again, this is part of what became your mission, I guess.

33:43.468 --> 33:43.668
Of course.

33:43.688 --> 33:44.148
Oh, yeah.

33:44.249 --> 33:44.829
This knowledge.

33:44.869 --> 33:47.473
Yeah, so almost all the Jewish literature was out at the time.

33:48.033 --> 33:50.196
We'd go out to New York and, you know, look for books.

33:50.256 --> 33:53.480
And it was very hard to find it, all kinds of adventures doing that.

33:53.500 --> 33:58.286
Eventually, when I'm in Brooklyn, suddenly I come in there and I see 10,000 books passed in this carriage.

33:58.747 --> 34:00.109
They had just gotten these books.

34:00.129 --> 34:01.150
They had been donated to them.

34:01.400 --> 34:07.410
There had been a commune of Jewish chicken farmers, Jewish socialist chicken farmers up at Aluma.

34:07.590 --> 34:12.098
And the chicken farmers had a large library of books, of Jewish books.

34:12.118 --> 34:15.163
And when they expanded the commune, the books were donated to this museum.

34:15.203 --> 34:16.264
They didn't know what to do with them.

34:16.304 --> 34:17.887
It's in Bacchus or Garamaic.

34:17.907 --> 34:19.490
No one knew the language.

34:20.071 --> 34:25.239
So they hired me to come in and try to sort these books out and make order of them.

34:25.259 --> 34:26.441
Which your interns do now.

34:26.882 --> 34:27.583
Yeah, exactly.

34:27.603 --> 34:28.825
And they didn't have enough money even.

34:29.041 --> 34:37.534
And the thing was operating in such a shoestring, so they got me, they used to pay me, I think it was $2 an hour, but only for 20 hours a week, although I worked for 40.

34:37.554 --> 34:43.723
And then they arranged for me to get food stamps, and the consolation was that I could have any duplicate books I could have.

34:44.504 --> 34:45.466
That's nice.

34:45.486 --> 34:46.648
That's a nice quirk.

34:46.668 --> 34:55.521
Believe me, at the time, I was really living in a smallman stamp in Fisco, and I was really on the quirk, I couldn't afford to borrow a train, I was taking the bus in, and it was really, really cheap, but

34:55.957 --> 34:57.560
for the prize of these books.

34:57.580 --> 34:59.783
Oh, yeah, and it was thrilling to me.

34:59.863 --> 35:03.610
Suddenly, here I am with all these books I'd never seen before, of course.

35:03.630 --> 35:06.995
And I spent almost five months sorting through them.

35:07.015 --> 35:10.741
And a number of people came to visit me in the course of that.

35:10.761 --> 35:18.173
There was a Yiddish writer who lived not far away, who used to come up, and she would tell me about the books, and she made things to me.

35:18.193 --> 35:19.255
It was a very good professor.

35:19.275 --> 35:20.597
So this was really adventurous.

35:20.637 --> 35:22.200
Oh, yeah, it was an amazing thing.

35:22.568 --> 35:26.836
And now I take it for granted that at the time I've never seen anything like this.

35:26.856 --> 35:27.818
So it was a great experience.

35:27.838 --> 35:32.427
I learned a great deal about Yiddish books in the course of all that and in the course of doing that work.

35:33.268 --> 35:44.610
One day an old man came into the library, a really old guy, and he said, Jungerman, Jungerman, the young man, a generic name, no Yiddishist, and he said, Jungerman, do you know why all these books are in such good condition?

35:45.299 --> 35:46.260
I said, no, I don't.

35:46.280 --> 35:47.021
He says, I'll tell you why.

35:47.041 --> 35:49.244
He says, it's because nobody ever read these books.

35:50.286 --> 35:51.327
I said, no, why didn't they read them?

35:51.347 --> 35:52.268
He says, I'll tell you why.

35:52.288 --> 36:01.440
He says, because we were a communist commune, and the party made everyone buy these books for appearance sake, and no one ever read them, so.

36:01.460 --> 36:06.147
But anyways, a lot of visitors learned a lot about the books, and we managed to get a good library for myself.

36:06.267 --> 36:10.853
By the end of this, I got shipped that 95 box of books, and I went back to Massachusetts.

36:10.873 --> 36:14.698
Then I studied Yiddish New York that summer, and then the following...

36:15.539 --> 36:18.121
I was in Montreal studying.

36:18.141 --> 36:24.266
Originally modern Jewish history, the East European Jewish history, then gradually switched over into Jewish literature.

36:24.306 --> 36:31.452
The more I learned, the more I, you know, the literature itself gave me a focus on the culture that the history itself could have provided.

36:31.472 --> 36:33.214
It's always this whole world opened up to me.

36:33.234 --> 36:35.636
I was able to lead a screw-up man up by then.

36:35.716 --> 36:37.017
You had it.

36:37.037 --> 36:39.279
I mean, you had the language of this world.

36:39.299 --> 36:43.142
Yeah, and the whole world, this whole literature was just opening up a formula.

36:43.162 --> 36:45.124
It was reading everything else at 3 or 3 in the morning.

36:45.627 --> 36:47.049
Yeah, it was a pretty intensive program.

36:47.189 --> 36:58.726
Where did we make the leap that, all right, this world had opened up on the one hand, but where also it dawned on, you became quite aware that it was also in great danger of disappearing?

36:58.786 --> 36:59.928
It came a little bit later on.

36:59.988 --> 37:06.057
After we had our first year or so in grad school, we used to have a real problem.

37:06.077 --> 37:09.081
We had a class, we never had more than six, seven, six years in the class.

37:09.622 --> 37:13.828
But even so, each class could teach us, okay, next week we're going to read such a bit of writing.

37:14.332 --> 37:15.714
And all these works were on prints.

37:15.774 --> 37:17.297
There's no way to get copies of the books.

37:17.317 --> 37:21.003
You couldn't buy it like you'd go get a Penguin edition on Dickens or something.

37:21.023 --> 37:23.086
There's no such thing.

37:23.106 --> 37:24.448
And we used to argue in class.

37:24.468 --> 37:28.856
I got the copy of the Jewish public libraries, the Jewish communal library in Montreal.

37:28.876 --> 37:30.258
And I got the copy of the McGill Library.

37:30.278 --> 37:30.899
And I was in.

37:31.340 --> 37:34.505
And the rest of us had a friend for ourselves with Veroxes and borrowing books.

37:34.625 --> 37:38.491
We used to go to old Jews where we knew had good libraries and borrow books from them.

37:38.571 --> 37:41.436
There were real problems getting through.

37:42.040 --> 37:51.270
Somewhere along there, I got a letter from a friend of mine that I had known out in California who had written to me to tell me about a, she had gone to visit her hometown in Ohio.

37:51.290 --> 37:52.671
I can't remember the city.

37:52.691 --> 37:53.893
I don't remember the name.

37:55.154 --> 37:57.337
And she went to visit this town city in Ohio.

37:57.377 --> 38:01.821
She saw a rabbi there who told her that he'd been given 900 Yiddish books to the man God.

38:01.841 --> 38:03.583
He gave 900 Yiddish books.

38:03.603 --> 38:05.405
He didn't know what to do with them, but no one wanted them.

38:05.425 --> 38:08.729
And he eventually sent them to the paper shredder.

38:08.749 --> 38:08.869
Gee.

38:08.889 --> 38:09.870
I read this letter, you know what I mean?

38:11.116 --> 38:13.380
I couldn't believe this.

38:13.900 --> 38:15.944
And I've heard stories like this before.

38:15.964 --> 38:16.544
Well, they were gone.

38:16.585 --> 38:17.366
They hadn't been shredded.

38:17.406 --> 38:18.247
Yeah, that was too late.

38:18.267 --> 38:19.129
So this was gone.

38:19.149 --> 38:21.052
Yeah, this was the story.

38:21.152 --> 38:24.136
Not long after that, I went down to New Bedford.

38:24.156 --> 38:26.640
It was in their parents' one of these.

38:26.660 --> 38:31.828
And I walked into the local synagogue there, and I just wanted to talk to the rabbi.

38:32.750 --> 38:38.018
I walked into his office, and I see on the floor of his office a fruit glass filled up with a lot of old Yiddish books.

38:39.449 --> 38:46.038
And among the books, the collected books were a writer named Mendelen and Moethesporam, one of the major Yiddish writers that I was writing my thesis on.

38:46.058 --> 38:46.198
Mendel?

38:46.779 --> 38:51.085
Yeah, M-E-N-D-E-L-E-N, and M-O-Y-K-H-E-R.

38:51.385 --> 38:52.667
K-H-E-R.

38:53.067 --> 38:54.890
That's S-F-O-R-I-N.

39:03.445 --> 39:07.951
And that was a pseudonym, the first great Yiddish writer called himself Mandela's person.

39:07.991 --> 39:09.654
So he used pseudonyms.

39:10.234 --> 39:11.136
Shalom aleichem.

39:11.156 --> 39:11.796
Yeah.

39:11.816 --> 39:14.540
There was a lot of stigma attached to Yiddish literature in the early days.

39:14.560 --> 39:14.861
Really?

39:14.881 --> 39:15.562
Is that right?

39:15.742 --> 39:20.949
These were all intellectuals who spoke many languages and writing Yiddish was going down.

39:21.009 --> 39:24.914
I'd like to have a college professor have people know that they read mysteries.

39:24.934 --> 39:25.575
Yes, exactly.

39:25.836 --> 39:28.459
There's another function as well.

39:28.479 --> 39:32.625
The other was that these were intellectuals who were speaking Russian, Hebrew in their own lives.

39:32.808 --> 39:35.631
in order for them to be effective narrated in the literature.

39:35.651 --> 39:36.692
They needed a persona.

39:36.712 --> 39:41.336
They put on these folks' personas that gave them a voice to use in their own stories.

39:41.356 --> 39:42.658
So that was kind of one of it.

39:42.678 --> 39:44.820
So it was a device, a literary device also?

39:44.880 --> 39:45.260
Yeah, exactly.

39:45.280 --> 39:46.481
As well as?

39:46.501 --> 39:49.304
Yeah, but the device was a telling one to call himself the book.

39:49.424 --> 39:50.966
Indeed, as I jumped on it.

39:50.986 --> 39:56.591
Yeah, it's because that was a very traditional role in traditional East European Jewish society.

39:56.611 --> 39:57.932
There were some people who were called .

39:58.053 --> 40:00.735
Which was when you were injured.

40:00.875 --> 40:02.697
Exactly, exactly.

40:03.115 --> 40:13.747
And that meant people who would travel from shtepel to shtepel from town to town, and they would carry with them either a little horse and wagon on their back a load of books.

40:13.767 --> 40:16.691
They would have religious books and some modern literature.

40:16.711 --> 40:20.054
They would have all kind of augmented religious life as well.

40:20.074 --> 40:22.097
And they would spread out their wares and sell this.

40:22.637 --> 40:26.682
But by doing that, they were one of the few Jews who had sanctioned travel on those.

40:26.722 --> 40:29.966
They became much more worldly than the Jews among whom they were traveling.

40:29.986 --> 40:32.008
So it was an interesting persona because it gave them away

40:32.596 --> 40:34.678
being both worldly and traditional.

40:35.479 --> 40:37.582
And it was a very traditional role.

40:37.602 --> 40:41.246
So you knew of this writer?

40:41.266 --> 40:41.767
Oh, sure, yes.

40:41.827 --> 40:43.149
I was writing my thesis on him.

40:43.309 --> 40:44.230
And you saw the book?

40:44.290 --> 40:45.311
And I couldn't find these books.

40:45.331 --> 40:47.374
And here I see the books in the basket.

40:47.394 --> 40:52.680
So I said, excuse me, Rabbi, what is Mendel doing on the floor in a fruit basket?

40:52.700 --> 40:55.824
And the rabbi said, oh, we're going to be throwing these books out.

40:55.844 --> 40:56.685
They weren't going to throw them out.

40:56.705 --> 41:00.049
They were going to bury these books, is what he said.

41:00.069 --> 41:00.289
Bury them?

41:00.309 --> 41:01.270
I said, what are you going to bury them?

41:01.840 --> 41:04.524
As a scientist, Jews have enormous respect for books, as you know.

41:04.544 --> 41:05.827
It's very central to the culture.

41:06.428 --> 41:10.454
Religious books which become unusable, they're too worn out to use anymore, are given a funeral.

41:10.514 --> 41:11.316
They're actually buried.

41:11.336 --> 41:12.297
Jews don't throw out books.

41:12.317 --> 41:12.878
They're buried.

41:12.898 --> 41:15.563
They actually give them a... One or two things can happen.

41:15.583 --> 41:19.169
You need to put them in what they call a genizah, which is a storehouse for old books.

41:19.249 --> 41:19.950
How do they spell that?

41:20.431 --> 41:24.998
G-E-N-I-Z-A-H, where they just sit forever.

41:25.018 --> 41:27.342
But they're actually buried with a regular funeral ceremony.

41:27.794 --> 41:29.076
attended by people?

41:29.096 --> 41:29.616
Oh, sure.

41:29.776 --> 41:30.437
Regular funeral.

41:30.457 --> 41:31.979
I mean, they have the whole thing.

41:32.340 --> 41:33.861
I've been to one such ceremony.

41:33.881 --> 41:34.943
It's very moving.

41:34.963 --> 41:36.004
Where was this?

41:36.024 --> 41:36.965
Oh, right here in Northampton.

41:37.045 --> 41:40.169
And this was done by you people?

41:40.189 --> 41:40.990
By the local synagogue.

41:41.371 --> 41:42.152
What did you think about it?

41:42.232 --> 41:43.273
Farying books?

41:43.293 --> 41:44.735
Well, these are books that were no longer usable.

41:44.755 --> 41:46.497
I mean, they really couldn't have been used anymore.

41:46.937 --> 41:49.060
These are old prayer books generally.

41:49.900 --> 41:53.184
From a practical standpoint, we'd say, let's just incinerate them that we have to.

41:53.244 --> 41:54.686
Yeah, well, this is a sign of respect.

41:54.706 --> 41:56.347
I mean, it fits in with all of it.

41:56.408 --> 42:00.612
Anyway, they're going to be burying the Yiddish books along with these Hebrew prayer books.

42:00.632 --> 42:02.334
But the condition of them was not bad.

42:02.394 --> 42:03.636
No, they were in fine shape.

42:03.656 --> 42:05.178
I said, we're going to bury these books.

42:05.218 --> 42:06.259
How can we bury these books?

42:07.000 --> 42:08.942
And they said, well, they didn't know what else to do with them.

42:08.962 --> 42:10.684
They'd been trying to give them to different libraries.

42:10.704 --> 42:11.565
Nobody wanted them.

42:11.585 --> 42:13.367
They just didn't know what else to do.

42:13.687 --> 42:15.610
And this was about when?

42:15.630 --> 42:17.612
This was in 70, probably 78.

42:19.280 --> 42:22.987
I can assure you that I can put these books to use.

42:23.047 --> 42:24.169
I even went through the basket.

42:24.190 --> 42:29.279
In addition to Mendelen, there happened to be a volume of Das Kapital in Yiddish translation.

42:29.299 --> 42:34.590
I said, listen, do you really want to be burying Das Kapital next to Talmud volumes?

42:34.630 --> 42:37.475
He said, do you want the books?

42:37.495 --> 42:38.016
You can have them.

42:38.277 --> 42:40.461
I think they dropped a few baskets on my shoulder.

42:40.880 --> 42:44.746
And I said, look, if you have more books, you know, I know millions of people who can read these books.

42:44.766 --> 42:46.529
Can we date it as starting right about here?

42:46.749 --> 42:48.652
Oh, yeah, this is getting there now.

42:48.672 --> 42:50.354
This is definitely getting there.

42:50.374 --> 42:52.978
Actually, the idea for the film came a little bit later.

42:52.998 --> 42:53.579
Oh, I'm trying to see it.

42:53.599 --> 42:54.581
I can feel it.

42:54.601 --> 42:58.507
So I said, look, if you have any more books from my parents, they'd be happy to pick them up.

42:58.527 --> 42:59.969
You know, I can definitely use them.

42:59.989 --> 43:01.251
But sure, you'd be happy to do that.

43:02.513 --> 43:11.426
Meantime, I headed back up to Montreal, and I thought, my God, if I could find this many books in a small town like New Bedford, imagine what I could find in a big city like Montreal.

43:11.446 --> 43:13.349
So I started letting it be known.

43:13.369 --> 43:14.891
This is, you know, no organization.

43:14.931 --> 43:19.858
I'm just for myself, my own personal use, that I personally was interested in Yiddish books.

43:19.878 --> 43:25.025
And before I knew it, I mean, boxes and bags and cartons of books began arriving.

43:25.045 --> 43:27.589
Did you think of yourself as a collector at this point?

43:27.689 --> 43:29.372
No, I was just getting my own research.

43:29.392 --> 43:31.815
You were getting material to support your own research.

43:31.895 --> 43:32.436
Yeah, exactly.

43:32.855 --> 43:34.858
But books are arriving.

43:34.898 --> 43:38.143
People would call me up when I had a bicycle and I'm racing around Montreal.

43:38.624 --> 43:44.233
Later I bought a motet from one of my students and I used that with a book basket on the back of it.

43:44.393 --> 43:46.656
The living room's filling up and the kitchen's filling up.

43:46.756 --> 43:49.721
Before I know it, I'm really inundated with books there.

43:51.704 --> 43:56.131
As a matter of fact, my girlfriend was complaining that the books were all over the bed when we finally had to buy one.

43:56.151 --> 43:58.294
It was like Guatemalan hammocks and hanging over the phone.

43:58.314 --> 43:59.196
It was completely out of hand.

43:59.216 --> 44:00.718
There were thousands of books everywhere.

44:01.188 --> 44:11.897
Somewhere along that time, my parents call up from New Bedford and say, Aaron, I think you better come down here pretty soon because the rabbi's given us so many books, we're afraid the second story of the house is about to collapse.

44:12.258 --> 44:13.459
Remember the rabbi's name?

44:13.499 --> 44:15.380
Yeah, Bernard Glassman.

44:15.400 --> 44:16.501
Bernard, right?

44:17.022 --> 44:17.162
Yeah.

44:17.182 --> 44:22.427
He's a very good scholar in his own right, a very bookish guy in his own right.

44:22.447 --> 44:24.328
What's the name of the temple?

44:24.348 --> 44:27.091
Tifereth, T-I-F-E-R-E-T-H.

44:27.611 --> 44:29.693
T-I-F-E-R.

44:29.892 --> 44:44.198
He was a guy with a real respect for books, as I say, and therefore he was able to convey that.

44:44.238 --> 44:45.640
He was very respectful.

44:45.741 --> 44:46.863
He might remember this.

44:46.943 --> 44:48.586
Maybe, yeah.

44:48.926 --> 44:51.230
He will at least remember giving books to my parents.

44:51.250 --> 44:52.693
He did that for quite a while afterwards.

44:53.298 --> 44:55.701
Anyway, so the books started piling up, piling up.

44:55.922 --> 44:57.003
Come to the house, the house.

44:57.023 --> 45:07.298
Yeah, and somewhere along here was when I realized that, my God, this really, it was right along this point, and we were sitting in class, I remember the exact day of cold winter day, and I'm sitting in class, and we're arguing once again where we're going to find the books.

45:07.499 --> 45:09.181
So there was an epiphanous moment.

45:09.201 --> 45:09.401
Oh, yeah.

45:09.421 --> 45:11.024
There was a light bulb that flies over your head.

45:11.044 --> 45:12.366
Yeah, I can remember exactly the moment.

45:12.386 --> 45:15.290
I was sitting in this classroom, and I'm thinking, this is ridiculous.

45:15.310 --> 45:22.360
Here we are, but you can't find books throughout classes, and yet it's clear that as an older generation is passing on, books are regularly being destroyed.

45:22.711 --> 45:24.513
Clearly, something needs to be done about it.

45:25.133 --> 45:26.154
And so I went to Ruth Wisse.

45:26.495 --> 45:27.896
She was the first one I spoke to.

45:27.916 --> 45:30.599
I said, look, I think we ought to do something about this.

45:30.619 --> 45:32.260
We ought to somehow collect these forms.

45:32.320 --> 45:34.362
And she thought it was a great idea.

45:34.382 --> 45:36.484
So I said, well, why don't you take a year or two off?

45:36.504 --> 45:37.866
I mean, you could take a year or two.

45:38.026 --> 45:39.167
I just finished a master's.

45:39.187 --> 45:42.290
It was like a European program.

45:42.310 --> 45:44.032
It was a three-year master's program.

45:44.052 --> 45:45.193
And I was just finishing it out.

45:45.333 --> 45:48.216
I said, why don't you take a few years off and then come back and get this job done.

45:49.037 --> 45:50.138
She said, it's a national problem.

45:50.158 --> 45:52.360
It's going to require a national solution.

45:52.380 --> 45:52.600
I said, OK.

45:53.913 --> 45:55.916
It's international if you're up in Canada.

45:55.936 --> 46:04.567
Using her name, I wrote to a number of leading scholars, Irving Powell, Saul Bellow, and Alfred Kaysen, a bunch of people like this.

46:04.587 --> 46:06.049
Alfred Kaysen's on our list.

46:06.149 --> 46:06.610
All right.

46:06.710 --> 46:07.872
Yeah.

46:08.012 --> 46:10.255
I wrote to all these people.

46:10.295 --> 46:11.316
Did they respond?

46:11.417 --> 46:13.019
Everyone responded.

46:13.039 --> 46:14.000
And I said, what do you think?

46:14.020 --> 46:16.604
I had an old portable pipe writer, and I banged up these letters.

46:16.624 --> 46:17.925
I said, what do you think of this idea?

46:17.965 --> 46:22.131
I want to try to rescue Yiddish books before the rest of them are destroyed, and what do you think?

46:22.634 --> 46:24.738
They all wrote back pretty much the same letter.

46:24.758 --> 46:26.141
They all think it's a great idea.

46:26.161 --> 46:29.308
It should be done immediately, but it might be too late.

46:29.348 --> 46:30.771
Too many books might have been destroyed already.

46:30.851 --> 46:39.529
At some point, not today, and you've got to make another trip to the Soviet Union, I understand, but at some point, do you think maybe I can get copies of some of these letters?

46:39.880 --> 46:42.543
Yeah, of course I'm not sure I can have those letters.

46:42.583 --> 46:44.064
This is a nationalist.

46:44.084 --> 46:45.506
We've got to have your archival stuff.

46:45.526 --> 46:46.026
I know, I know.

46:46.046 --> 46:47.388
We have a pretty good archive of everything.

46:47.468 --> 46:48.209
This is seminal stuff, you know.

46:48.249 --> 46:48.509
I know.

46:48.529 --> 46:51.072
This is before the Book Center started, so I'm not even sure where these are.

46:51.092 --> 46:52.133
Okay, well, think about it.

46:52.153 --> 46:54.015
You better find that stuff, because it's important.

46:54.455 --> 46:55.716
We have plenty of other archives.

46:55.736 --> 46:58.019
We have mountains and mountains of archival history.

46:58.499 --> 47:00.902
Anyway, so they all wrote back pretty much the same letters.

47:01.182 --> 47:02.343
I bet you they were thrilled.

47:02.363 --> 47:02.644
What's that?

47:02.864 --> 47:04.365
I bet you they were thrilled.

47:04.486 --> 47:04.926
Oh, I think.

47:05.210 --> 47:08.975
Yeah, I'd be interested to hear from him if he remembers this or he remembers what he thought.

47:08.995 --> 47:10.577
I've got his phone number I'm supposed to call.

47:10.637 --> 47:13.841
I'd like to hear what he, I've never met him, to see if he remembers what he thought.

47:13.961 --> 47:17.386
I was at what amounted to a master's course.

47:17.406 --> 47:21.351
It was just a seminar he gave to book friends in New York.

47:21.391 --> 47:25.636
But I mean, it's like being with Socrates.

47:25.657 --> 47:27.599
It's like being with Plato.

47:27.679 --> 47:29.782
And he just spoke.

47:29.802 --> 47:33.006
And then he did do a new book now on New York, which I reviewed.

47:33.762 --> 47:36.645
And so they gave me this one.

47:36.666 --> 47:37.567
So I think you can help me.

47:37.907 --> 47:39.149
Oh, that's good, yeah.

47:39.169 --> 47:41.571
I remember one of them certainly can help me, yeah.

47:41.591 --> 47:43.894
A long time ago, it was 1979 that we did that.

47:43.914 --> 47:45.196
Yeah, I think you're wonderful, man.

47:45.296 --> 47:46.117
I love the way it was.

47:46.237 --> 47:47.939
Anyway, so basically... Let me know.

47:47.959 --> 47:50.102
I'd love to hear if you remember it.

47:50.282 --> 47:52.284
We've got to be in touch.

47:52.445 --> 47:52.805
Okay.

47:55.488 --> 47:57.090
Go ahead.

47:57.150 --> 47:58.492
So, we... I went down to New York.

47:58.532 --> 48:01.896
I met with a lot of people who were experts in British books and British literature.

48:02.433 --> 48:09.801
The best guess anybody had was there was 75,000 recoverable volumes still, actually, from the United States.

48:09.881 --> 48:11.403
And that seemed like a reasonable guess.

48:11.423 --> 48:12.945
That was what everyone could figure.

48:12.965 --> 48:13.606
That was something else.

48:14.086 --> 48:17.650
And I figured that would take about two years to round those things up.

48:17.670 --> 48:21.194
And did you have any idea at that point where you were going to house them?

48:21.214 --> 48:21.374
No.

48:21.394 --> 48:28.322
I didn't know anything at the time, but my first instinct was to go to the major Jewish organizations to ask them to sponsor the project.

48:28.724 --> 48:29.385
I have this idea.

48:29.405 --> 48:30.828
It's not that expensive.

48:30.848 --> 48:32.631
You just need a truck and get out.

48:32.651 --> 48:33.913
75,000 books or titles?

48:35.335 --> 48:35.716
Books.

48:36.036 --> 48:36.156
Books.

48:36.177 --> 48:38.641
So there was a lot of replication, obviously, of titles.

48:38.901 --> 48:40.544
Yeah, but that was the guess.

48:40.564 --> 48:42.848
There would be 75,000 volumes kicking around out there.

48:43.709 --> 48:46.013
And as you know, we've gone on to collect almost a million books.

48:46.053 --> 48:47.315
You're pushing the first minute.

48:47.335 --> 48:49.419
Yes, everybody was wrong, obviously, but no one knew.

48:49.479 --> 48:54.607
Well, I went around to the major Jewish organizations, and they all told me the same thing.

48:54.627 --> 48:54.968
I said, look.

48:55.673 --> 48:57.716
These are like bureaucrats in Europe.

48:57.736 --> 48:58.457
Yiddish is dead.

48:58.497 --> 48:59.679
Why are you wasting your time?

48:59.739 --> 49:00.920
No one cares about these folks anymore.

49:00.940 --> 49:02.342
Who would have said that, Yiddish is dead?

49:03.203 --> 49:03.604
Everybody.

49:04.906 --> 49:07.429
Every major national Jewish organization would have said that.

49:07.449 --> 49:15.901
I mean, were they resigned to the fact that such a... Yeah, because they're not really involved in a cultural agenda, these people, dealing with Israel and with other issues.

49:15.921 --> 49:18.244
There were more pressing concerns.

49:18.625 --> 49:19.606
Yeah, I guess.

49:20.067 --> 49:22.250
I can't believe they would basically say, who cares?

49:22.570 --> 49:23.351
I'll read that.

49:23.371 --> 49:23.892
It's too late.

49:24.614 --> 49:26.137
No, they didn't say it was too late.

49:26.157 --> 49:27.298
They said, who cares?

49:27.419 --> 49:27.619
Who cares?

49:27.639 --> 49:28.180
Who cares?

49:28.300 --> 49:28.901
This is dead.

49:28.921 --> 49:29.843
Why don't you go back to school?

49:29.863 --> 49:30.784
Why don't you go to Israel?

49:30.844 --> 49:32.327
What are you wasting your time for?

49:33.148 --> 49:33.869
Oh, yeah.

49:33.929 --> 49:34.811
That kind of stuff.

49:34.851 --> 49:36.574
That was the general attitude.

49:36.594 --> 49:38.116
This was not important.

49:38.136 --> 49:39.799
Some Jewish people?

49:39.819 --> 49:40.480
Oh, yeah.

49:40.500 --> 49:40.781
I'm amazed.

49:40.801 --> 49:43.124
The establishment is very non-focused on cultural work.

49:44.467 --> 49:47.171
And there was no money for it coming, of course.

49:47.191 --> 49:48.934
I figured this really wasn't the way to...

49:49.454 --> 49:55.961
I was going to sit around and argue with these guys in the next 10 years, and I think my new books were being destroyed, and I figured I just had to go out and do something.

49:55.981 --> 49:58.824
Destroyed in the manner that you have described already.

49:58.904 --> 50:00.646
In the literal sense.

50:00.706 --> 50:02.588
Most often, it never got that far.

50:02.628 --> 50:04.810
What often happened, a grandparent would die.

50:05.471 --> 50:06.712
They leave behind everything.

50:06.772 --> 50:08.294
The kids come in to clean out the apartment.

50:08.314 --> 50:10.857
They find a bunch of old books, and the books get thrown in the garbage cans.

50:10.877 --> 50:13.660
And this has been happening for years.

50:14.501 --> 50:18.685
Well, obviously, not just Yiddish books, but from your standpoint, obviously.

50:18.985 --> 50:23.833
Because we're talking about a very fragile culture.

50:23.913 --> 50:24.294
Sure.

50:24.334 --> 50:26.839
There's no continuity beyond that.

50:27.720 --> 50:29.363
And that's the whole thing to keep in mind with all of it.

50:29.383 --> 50:31.126
These aren't just books we're talking about.

50:31.587 --> 50:34.472
These books are the repository of the entire culture.

50:34.652 --> 50:39.340
All that transpired in the last thousand years of Jewish history resides in these books, particularly after the Holocaust.

50:40.096 --> 50:48.465
one out of every two Yiddish-speaking Jews is murdered in the Holocaust.

50:51.428 --> 51:02.721
There's a culture that was literally ripped out of its roof.

51:02.801 --> 51:04.843
And murdered.

51:05.224 --> 51:09.208
Murdered.

51:09.880 --> 51:12.484
So, half are murdered, writing summarily.

51:13.065 --> 51:16.590
And then, of course, you've got the attrition process happening 40 years subsequent to that.

51:16.610 --> 51:19.834
Of course, and a lot of the others were in the Soviet Union with terrible persecution.

51:21.336 --> 51:27.425
On August 12, 1952, all the major Yiddish writers in the Soviet Union were shot on a single murder.

51:27.505 --> 51:32.092
Is this kind of why writers like Samuel Francis who lived in New York forever?

51:32.232 --> 51:35.337
Did he used to write in Yiddish?

51:35.417 --> 51:39.162
Is he paying homage to his... I think it's the idea of...

51:39.260 --> 51:40.742
You have to ask him that question.

51:40.762 --> 51:42.784
I can't answer for him, but I think that's his idiom.

51:42.804 --> 51:43.865
That's his language.

51:43.885 --> 51:51.774
It's just like if you had to move to another country today, you'd still end up, I think your literary voice would still be English regardless of where you went.

51:52.034 --> 51:55.718
Yeah, I think if you like Joseph Conrad, he could do it.

51:55.739 --> 51:56.680
Conrad was Polish.

51:56.800 --> 51:58.982
Yeah, that's pretty rare though.

51:59.022 --> 52:03.327
I mean, any Jewish writers have done that too.

52:03.897 --> 52:12.570
Many Jewish writers were written in indigenous languages, and the Coptic is only one of them, and there are thousands, right?

52:12.590 --> 52:16.576
Yeah, so he wrote in English, right?

52:16.596 --> 52:31.980
Yeah, so there are some who are able to... But it was symbolic, because he became... Some could do it, but I think in this case, most Yiddish writers... Most Yiddish writers are multilingual, and there are very few of them.

52:32.483 --> 52:35.568
of Yiddish writers who were not fluent in several other languages.

52:35.588 --> 52:37.772
Most Yiddish writers were intellectuals.

52:37.792 --> 52:43.080
I mean, a guy like Shlomo Leif and spoke Russian, which is clearly not Yiddish, his personal correspondence with Hebrew and Russian.

52:43.681 --> 52:49.150
Yiddish was a literary language, and he wrote... A beautiful writer, and his stuff does translate a lot.

52:49.250 --> 52:51.434
Yeah, I mean, like our literature, it's... How do I know?

52:51.454 --> 52:52.816
Because I can't read Yiddish.

52:52.836 --> 52:53.878
But it's great literature.

52:53.978 --> 52:55.601
I enjoy his stories a lot.

52:55.661 --> 52:58.305
So I'll get a little bit of it.

52:58.387 --> 52:59.468
Oh, really?

52:59.548 --> 53:01.511
Oh, let's see.

53:01.691 --> 53:07.678
Yeah, I have to speak with him Sunday after.

53:07.799 --> 53:08.800
It's lovely.

53:08.900 --> 53:10.061
Yeah.

53:10.582 --> 53:11.763
Go ahead.

53:11.783 --> 53:12.044
So.

53:14.427 --> 53:15.548
We'll be switching in a minute.

53:16.009 --> 53:18.492
Okay, where we know we're at.

53:19.453 --> 53:21.956
We're talking about the books are more than books.

53:22.436 --> 53:26.181
But books are being used to 75,000 recoverable.

53:26.221 --> 53:26.461
Right.

53:26.501 --> 53:27.803
So, anyways, I figured it out.

53:28.357 --> 53:32.423
around for the next 10 years, but in the meantime, something that needs to be done about all this.

53:32.463 --> 53:35.346
So I decided I would just start a new organization.

53:35.367 --> 53:38.931
I came to Amherst at Ruth's advice.

53:38.951 --> 53:42.676
It was difficult to do with the Montreal because of the border problem.

53:42.696 --> 53:43.838
And we come from New York.

53:43.858 --> 53:47.543
There were a lot of old Yiddish organizations in New York and a lot of politics there.

53:47.583 --> 53:50.006
And we really wanted to make clear this was something brand new.

53:50.026 --> 53:57.857
We weren't fighting old battles, but we were really trying to reach a new generation, save these books for the future, not for the past.

53:58.428 --> 54:01.591
as a precondition for the study of Yiddish culture in future generations.

54:01.832 --> 54:03.974
So there was real reason for coming here.

54:03.994 --> 54:06.216
I had good contacts in the area.

54:06.236 --> 54:12.963
Again, I moved down here, put together a board of directors of local faculty members, administrators, people I knew from the area.

54:13.944 --> 54:19.911
This is, as you embark on what you perceive at that point to be at best a two-year admission?

54:19.951 --> 54:20.772
That's right, that's right.

54:21.372 --> 54:25.937
The summer of 79, I spent up in Maine, right after I spoke with the establishment, I was told what I was told.

54:26.390 --> 54:36.739
I went up to Maine and we were picking blueberries, you know, in the blueberry harvest up there, a little bit of money, enough to print up letterhead and to get things off the ground.

54:36.759 --> 54:41.223
During the fall of 79, spring of 1980, I started organizing it.

54:41.243 --> 54:44.846
I was still finishing my thesis at the same time.

54:44.866 --> 54:49.791
And then in April of 1980, we opened up and incorporated it.

54:49.911 --> 54:52.833
It was called the National Yiddish Exchange, originally.

54:52.853 --> 54:54.675
We changed the name shortly thereafter at the center.

54:55.381 --> 55:00.427
And then in June of 1980, we'd done an old factory building over in Florence.

55:00.447 --> 55:01.628
We didn't have any money at all.

55:01.648 --> 55:03.170
We blocked our way into the lease.

55:03.190 --> 55:04.311
We said we were getting the food around.

55:04.331 --> 55:05.512
We made up some story.

55:06.213 --> 55:08.796
We got this old loft and moved in there.

55:08.876 --> 55:12.960
I don't have hoped at some point that the support would have been forthcoming.

55:13.240 --> 55:16.424
To this day, we're still a grassroots organization.

55:16.544 --> 55:18.566
It probably gives you your edge, too.

55:18.586 --> 55:19.808
Oh, yeah, I think so.

55:19.908 --> 55:21.249
But it's a huge struggle.

55:21.269 --> 55:24.713
You cannot imagine the struggle as many times we've kind of left.

55:24.980 --> 55:27.864
cluttering on the edge of bankruptcy.

55:28.445 --> 55:30.749
It's so regular that we're kind of used to it by now.

55:31.249 --> 55:34.514
The first five years, none of us were paid and we couldn't even afford heat.

55:34.534 --> 55:37.038
We used to work with those gloves without the fingers on them and stuff.

55:37.098 --> 55:40.604
I mean, it was really tough going for a long time.

55:40.624 --> 55:51.460
But we moved in and then knew him in nothing because of old government surplus furniture and a government surplus IBM typewriter.

55:51.794 --> 56:07.471
It didn't matter what the content was.

56:07.812 --> 56:13.978
It's too early in the history of that literature to understand what's important and what's not.

56:13.998 --> 56:18.103
So that's not your job then, to assess merit, shall we say?

56:18.163 --> 56:18.684
Not right now.

56:18.804 --> 56:19.945
We're collecting a lot of books.

56:20.245 --> 56:23.028
Yeah, and to make the book accessible.

56:23.829 --> 56:31.698
Anyway, the word went out, and the press releases got picked up, and some feature stories ran, and the Globe, and then the Times afterwards, and things started to spread.

56:31.738 --> 56:33.680
But we knew we were getting values with letters.

56:33.700 --> 56:35.962
I mean, you know, and first letters came in.

56:36.663 --> 56:38.525
You know, see, no one knew how many books were out there.

56:38.545 --> 56:41.749
The first were hundreds and hundreds of letters started coming in.

56:41.789 --> 56:42.730
These are all in the files.

56:43.951 --> 56:46.774
And then pretty soon, thousands of books began arriving.

56:46.794 --> 56:47.195
Arriving?

56:47.235 --> 56:47.875
Are you able to get them?

56:47.896 --> 56:49.257
Arriving, by now.

56:49.760 --> 56:52.344
It was so many that the post office started squawking.

56:52.364 --> 56:53.125
They just couldn't handle this.

56:53.165 --> 56:54.768
You know, we had a congressman intervene.

56:54.788 --> 56:56.791
I mean, things really got out of hand.

56:57.012 --> 56:57.913
Is that right?

56:57.933 --> 56:58.254
Oh, yeah.

56:58.274 --> 56:59.876
It went on for a year, I mean, to get the office.

56:59.896 --> 57:00.658
Was he supportive?

57:00.678 --> 57:01.619
Yeah, very good.

57:01.639 --> 57:03.282
That was a pretty good deal.

57:03.302 --> 57:04.243
Yeah.

57:04.263 --> 57:05.205
I'm going to switch the tape.

57:05.305 --> 57:05.545
Okay.

57:06.908 --> 57:08.410
It's about to run out, but I don't want to talk.

58:00.466 --> 58:24.571
.

58:24.591 --> 58:24.611
.

58:24.631 --> 58:24.651
.

58:45.758 --> 58:46.775
Thank you.

59:50.609 --> 01:00:03.876
Thank you.
