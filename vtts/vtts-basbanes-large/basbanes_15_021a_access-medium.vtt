00:01.550 --> 00:30.038
I have no idea, but I know that

00:30.102 --> 00:32.605
you know, the titles are not copyrightable.

00:32.625 --> 00:37.670
So in Germany, apparently, there's been a very successful book called The Law School of some other nature, and they wanted to change the title.

00:37.690 --> 00:59.873
So I think they will call it The Law School of the Law School of the Law School of some other nature, and they wanted to change the title, so I think they will call it The Law School of the Law School of the Law School of the Law School of the Law School of the Law School of the Law School of the Law School of the Law School of the Law School of the Law School of the Law School of the Law School of the Law School of the Law School of the Law School of the Law School of the Law School of the Law School of the Law School of the Law School of the Law School of the Law School of the Law School of the Law School of the Law School of the Law School of the Law School of the Law School of the Law School of the Law School of the Law School of the Law School of the Law School of the Law School of the Law School of the Law

01:00.241 --> 01:04.348
No, someone has published a book of juvenilia, and I can't remember.

01:04.368 --> 01:07.132
I have to find out what it is.

01:08.094 --> 01:10.858
But it's not like you're going over the Andromeda Spring.

01:11.139 --> 01:12.921
Finished work for you is finished work.

01:12.941 --> 01:13.863
Is that a fair assumption?

01:14.123 --> 01:14.564
Oh, no.

01:14.684 --> 01:18.911
I think it was— The context was the terminal man.

01:18.971 --> 01:26.383
You said you were looking over—

01:27.511 --> 01:31.956
Sometime in the last two years, Valentine reissued all the books.

01:31.976 --> 01:36.561
And at that time, I went through and got, because I have, you know, a list of errors and, you know.

01:36.581 --> 01:37.642
Factual errors.

01:37.662 --> 01:37.962
Yeah.

01:38.763 --> 01:42.027
And you sort of cleaned them up for the final edition.

01:42.047 --> 01:43.168
Right.

01:43.208 --> 01:48.414
Did Spielberg talk to you at all about things that he thought he'd like to see in a sequel at any point?

01:50.096 --> 01:52.939
You know, was there any kind of conference between the two of you?

01:55.462 --> 01:56.623
Well, um,

01:58.493 --> 02:07.764
We had, you know, it's silly to do something that Stephen wouldn't like.

02:10.407 --> 02:20.839
On the other hand, I really feel as though I have to do what I think is the thing to do, and then he'll have to make the movie that he wants to make.

02:20.859 --> 02:27.066
So we had a discussion where I talked to him about what I wanted to do.

02:28.987 --> 02:31.389
and he was, you know, approving at that time.

02:32.570 --> 02:39.817
And was there any thought, you've got Ian Malcolm as the only character who's returning in this sequel.

02:40.478 --> 02:44.962
Was that always, did you always want to have one holdover, or?

02:44.982 --> 02:50.287
No, I was willing to have others, or it just kind of turned out that way.

02:50.307 --> 02:51.868
You certainly have an affection for Ian.

02:51.888 --> 02:54.050
You quote him in one of the epigraphs.

02:54.070 --> 02:55.872
Yeah, and also you need him.

02:56.071 --> 02:57.773
Why do you need him?

02:57.833 --> 02:59.114
Can I interrupt you, please?

02:59.655 --> 03:03.338
Because he's the ironic commentator on you, actually.

03:03.358 --> 03:07.342
Can we get a comment about the kids today, as you've seen them?

03:07.702 --> 03:15.810
They gave you kind of a recognition gasp when you talked about how competitive it was in your day.

03:16.631 --> 03:18.713
How did you feel about this group of kids?

03:19.274 --> 03:21.256
I think they were terrific.

03:21.276 --> 03:24.559
Anything that's about the school today that

03:27.307 --> 03:40.438
It seems, I mean, first of all, I can't tell you, and I've hardly been here, but it seems very similar to me.

03:44.317 --> 03:54.352
You said in response to one of the kids in the earlier session that it takes longer for you to write.

03:54.953 --> 03:55.433
Why is that?

03:55.453 --> 03:55.954
Is it harder?

03:55.974 --> 03:56.335
I don't know.

03:56.936 --> 03:57.617
Does it get harder?

03:58.238 --> 04:00.661
It gets harder, too.

04:03.986 --> 04:07.251
You've done more things.

04:07.271 --> 04:11.337
You make more demands on yourself, I think.

04:14.422 --> 04:20.769
And there's something about... I don't know how you would say it.

04:20.789 --> 04:32.441
My experience is that as I get older, I have a more complicated life experience, and that it's not possible to.

04:32.461 --> 04:39.569
You know, a book like A Case of Me, which I wrote in my 20s, I just don't think that way anymore.

04:39.589 --> 04:41.290
I don't see things that way.

04:41.310 --> 04:42.792
It's a nice, clean,

04:43.767 --> 04:53.242
Now that you've got a little girl, have you thought of writing a children's story at all?

04:53.282 --> 04:56.687
Yes, I thought of it, but I haven't done it.

04:56.707 --> 04:58.250
Seems like a good idea.

04:58.530 --> 05:05.501
Your previous two books, you've had your brushes with the police and the political correctitude that you're now.

05:05.801 --> 05:08.305
Do you expect anything at all out of this?

05:08.966 --> 05:11.310
Any hassles?

05:11.628 --> 05:30.042
When you say you make more demands for yourself as a novelist,

05:39.708 --> 05:57.432
this next book that you're talking about that'll come out maybe in 1996, the idea that it's going to be an instant bestseller, and then it comes out, and how well it compared to your other work.

05:57.452 --> 06:01.738
Robert Rauschenberg once said that he had to do new work in order for people to like his old work.

06:03.361 --> 06:08.027
They could say, well, I don't like the new work, but I like the old work.

06:10.690 --> 06:12.232
No, the publishers were great.

06:12.292 --> 06:17.499
I mean, nobody ever told me they were going to publish too many copies, because I would have, you know, stopped writing right then.

06:18.240 --> 06:20.202
Who can deal with that?

06:22.164 --> 06:25.769
I was horrified before, you know, they kept it from me.

06:25.789 --> 06:28.913
You said you were always, always surprised at the popularity.

06:29.534 --> 06:29.634
Yeah.

06:29.974 --> 06:37.023
Who is your, do you have a perceived audience, a readership that you're writing for?

06:37.043 --> 06:40.107
You know, I imagine it's, I don't know.

06:40.289 --> 06:42.051
No, I just sort of write what interests me.

06:43.974 --> 06:52.265
But I'm surprised when, I was really surprised when a seven-and-a-half-year-old girl asked me to sign her copy of Jurassic Park when she had just finished.

06:53.667 --> 06:54.387
I thought, really?

06:55.028 --> 06:56.470
Did she ask intelligent questions?

06:56.650 --> 07:00.315
Yeah, she'd rather.

07:00.335 --> 07:03.780
So I don't think we know what'll happen.

07:03.800 --> 07:07.765
But when you're actually writing, when the creative process is going,

07:07.964 --> 07:09.446
You don't have a reader in mind?

07:09.466 --> 07:12.732
I don't have a reader in mind, no.

07:12.752 --> 07:16.618
So you have to be happy with it.

07:16.638 --> 07:19.322
Yes, I think I'm the reader in that way.

07:19.362 --> 07:24.771
You said to the kids earlier you hadn't gone to see Congo.

07:25.111 --> 07:35.608
Was it because Kennedy and Marshall were friends of yours and it might be awkward considering the bad reviews that the movie got to sit there and say to them what you really think?

07:37.192 --> 07:42.878
No, because they are friends of mine, and I've talked to them about what I would probably think if I'd seen it.

07:45.700 --> 07:56.031
No, actually what happened was they had previews prior to the release, and I was out of town.

07:57.432 --> 07:59.855
I can't remember where we were, but we were gone.

07:59.875 --> 08:06.321
And then when we came back, we left and went to Hawaii, and the Fisher hadn't been released

08:06.942 --> 08:10.166
I don't know why yet, and we kind of missed it.

08:10.186 --> 08:11.448
That's all.

08:11.468 --> 08:12.990
It just doesn't have anything to do.

08:13.010 --> 08:15.453
I'd like to ask you something as I've traveled.

08:16.754 --> 08:26.126
Halfway through the book, you deal with a section of your father's death that seems to suggest that there might be more you might want to write about.

08:26.206 --> 08:30.892
Have you written at all about that relationship, and will you?

08:31.613 --> 08:34.857
I would like to write more.

08:36.625 --> 08:39.248
And I just haven't gotten it.

08:39.268 --> 08:42.732
I haven't done it.

08:42.772 --> 08:48.659
When you talk about the new school years, you don't seem to allude at all to, perhaps, tension at home.

08:49.780 --> 08:52.864
Was that a difficult period because of that?

08:55.707 --> 09:04.557
I have to sort of go off the record and ask you, or tell you that my mother, who is in her late seventies, as Drea said about

09:04.942 --> 09:08.835
I don't know if I could even mention anything about my dad, so I kind of promise her that I won't talk about it.

09:08.855 --> 09:14.153
I will write eventually, but I prefer Natalie.

09:15.096 --> 09:16.521
I prefer her.

09:20.635 --> 09:29.629
Is there in fact a volume of poetry?

09:29.990 --> 09:34.177
Yeah, and my forthcoming light opera and my ballet, no.

09:34.197 --> 09:36.200
But do you write poetry at all?

09:36.220 --> 09:36.521
I don't.

09:37.202 --> 09:39.485
Okay, but are you working on a play then?

09:39.505 --> 09:44.233
You mentioned you are challenged by the prospect of writing a play.

09:44.253 --> 09:47.959
And we're talking about a play that would be staged, but I would play something on the screen.

09:48.783 --> 09:52.768
You know, I don't want to say too much about the future.

09:52.828 --> 09:54.009
I am interested in that.

09:54.029 --> 10:06.144
Has Hollywood sort of come to you, you know, producers or directors, saying, do you have an outline of a story or something that you'd want to do, not write a book first, but just do something original for the screen?

10:06.805 --> 10:08.807
And have you thought of going back to direct a movie?

10:11.511 --> 10:14.454
Well, I think there's always asking for stories.

10:14.534 --> 10:16.697
And I have thought about directing, but I don't know.

10:19.411 --> 10:21.113
I don't know.

10:21.213 --> 10:24.117
I guess it really depends on the project.

10:25.338 --> 10:29.563
I consider directing disclosure very, for a long time.

10:29.583 --> 10:32.366
And then there seems to be a writing period.

10:34.308 --> 10:37.993
You talked about, I think you were kidding a little bit about running away from reviewers.

10:38.734 --> 10:40.676
No, I wasn't.

10:40.696 --> 10:42.038
Do you really care at this point?

10:42.058 --> 10:42.979
Well, I run away.

10:43.079 --> 10:43.820
I don't like it.

10:43.840 --> 10:45.802
I mean, I don't like negative reviews.

10:45.822 --> 10:46.783
Well, what about positive ones?

10:46.803 --> 10:48.405
Do they mean anything?

10:49.060 --> 10:57.889
But I might open a magazine and see it by accident.

10:57.909 --> 11:13.646
Do you think it's in a way though, I mean, rationally, some way you say to yourself, you can't have it all, you can't have this incredible success and have people like your, have everybody like your stuff at the same time?

11:14.166 --> 11:15.928
Sure, I understand what's going on, but I think

11:18.389 --> 11:31.190
You know, there's a thing beyond the reviews, which is really, by this time in the life of the book, it has nothing to do with it.

11:31.210 --> 11:31.891
I've done mine.

11:32.833 --> 11:33.574
I'm finished.

11:33.594 --> 11:34.335
I've been finished for weeks.

11:34.656 --> 11:44.312
And whether it sells well or badly, whether people like it, whether Stephen likes it, whether the public likes it, whether Newsweek likes it,

11:45.929 --> 11:47.611
It has nothing to do with it.

11:47.851 --> 11:48.992
It's a response.

11:49.173 --> 11:51.075
That's the weight of the boat, you know.

11:51.235 --> 11:54.038
That's back there, churning up the boat.

11:54.058 --> 11:55.219
I'm not there anymore.

11:55.379 --> 12:10.897
And so one of the reasons for going to Japan is to really be orienting myself forward and not to be... Because if I do stay here and pay a lot of attention to the reaction, I will get a threat.

12:10.917 --> 12:14.080
How are you perceived, or do you know, in Japan?

12:14.532 --> 12:18.055
Yeah, I was there a couple years ago, yeah.

12:19.076 --> 12:19.877
They liked me a lot.

12:20.418 --> 12:24.902
I mean, they understand all the arguments and arguments, so I'm better than the Americans, obviously.

12:24.922 --> 12:29.506
They know everything.

12:29.526 --> 12:35.772
Now, I don't know how you feel about people knowing, but why are you generous to dinosaur science?

12:35.792 --> 12:37.974
Why does it matter to you?

12:38.315 --> 12:39.996
It's premature to talk about that.

12:40.016 --> 12:41.017
Okay.

12:41.037 --> 12:42.919
You're not generous.

12:44.401 --> 12:47.085
Jurassic Park was a really clever what-if.

12:47.165 --> 12:52.152
I mean, the premise there was scientific research.

12:52.252 --> 12:56.779
Is this a credible what-if here, you think, with the sequel?

12:56.799 --> 12:59.002
Did you continue along with this?

12:59.022 --> 13:12.822
Well, it certainly went to the, you know, in my way of thinking, there's a small question in the original Jurassic Park that has to do with

13:13.730 --> 13:29.628
technology, and there's a large question in the sequel which has to do with evolution, you know, where the whole enterprise is going, where we're going, how it all works, and whether our behavior matters to that.

13:30.749 --> 13:42.943
It's really, how I think of it is it's written sort of against the implications of the commentary theory,

13:43.480 --> 13:49.205
And the theory that a large comment may have struck at the Unicitation Committee may very well be true.

13:50.446 --> 13:57.432
But I think people will take that information and run with it, and imagine that they'll let them off the hook for certain kinds of behavior now.

13:57.512 --> 13:58.853
And I don't think we should be off the hook.

13:59.874 --> 14:02.336
You do a tremendous amount of research for all of your books.

14:03.137 --> 14:04.779
Did that hold true with this book as well?

14:04.899 --> 14:06.700
Was there a lot of research necessary?

14:07.821 --> 14:08.442
Yeah.

14:08.462 --> 14:12.205
Having to do with evolution, mostly.

14:12.337 --> 14:15.802
very dense and visible.

14:15.982 --> 14:30.062
Somebody like Stuart Coughlin who does chaos and adaptation and all the stuff out of the Santa Fe Institute is dense going for me and it's a triumph of the day.

14:30.283 --> 14:34.629
Did you ever hear from the government of Costa Rica about Jurassic Park?

14:35.430 --> 14:35.691
No.

14:36.151 --> 14:40.858
Although Kathy Kennedy told me that – I've never been to Costa Rica – and Kathy Kennedy told me

14:41.750 --> 14:46.176
about what hotel I stay at when I'm there.

14:46.216 --> 14:47.077
Thank you, everybody.

14:47.878 --> 14:48.999
Very nice.

14:49.040 --> 14:54.266
Do any of you need like photo, bio, cover art stuff?

14:54.627 --> 14:58.452
You guys want any of that?

14:58.732 --> 14:59.774
Thank you very much.

15:01.416 --> 15:03.158
Oh, you're welcome.

15:03.599 --> 15:04.720
Very nice to be here.

15:04.953 --> 15:34.588
Do you want to sign or do you want to sign too?

15:35.378 --> 15:36.319
You know how to.

15:36.339 --> 15:37.820
Yes, they know how to.

15:38.661 --> 15:40.002
They're a white collector.

15:40.022 --> 15:40.142
Yeah.

15:40.162 --> 15:41.563
Actually, the challenge is to not work.

15:42.704 --> 15:44.546
To not work.

15:44.566 --> 15:48.649
Good idea, right?

15:48.689 --> 15:49.069
Yeah.

15:49.530 --> 15:51.952
I'd love to see you.

15:51.972 --> 15:55.135
Do you understand that?

15:55.835 --> 15:57.937
I'm captive.

15:59.358 --> 16:03.782
I'm going to go to Japan.

16:03.802 --> 16:05.183
First trade edition?

16:11.052 --> 16:17.788
The questions were terrific.
