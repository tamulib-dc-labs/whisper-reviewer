WEBVTT

00:01.887 --> 00:05.390
to Carlos Fuentes.

00:06.731 --> 00:07.172
We're on.

00:07.192 --> 00:08.653
I'm going to just put this here.

00:09.194 --> 00:11.996
We have two books here.

00:12.817 --> 00:13.157
Yes.

00:13.177 --> 00:18.402
These are narrated by dead people, for the most part.

00:18.422 --> 00:19.383
For the most part.

00:19.403 --> 00:20.344
For the most part.

00:21.064 --> 00:23.387
And this is narrated by a fetus.

00:23.447 --> 00:25.028
That's right.

00:25.669 --> 00:27.030
Do I detect something here?

00:27.690 --> 00:30.493
In terms of...

00:30.980 --> 00:40.430
Well, it's life and death, and a continuity between one and the other, and the necessity of death in order to have life.

00:40.450 --> 00:51.483
Death being the predecessor of life, the creator of life, or inevitable deaths are the source of the continuity of life.

00:52.123 --> 00:55.407
That's the way we Mexicans look at it.

00:55.587 --> 00:58.650
Death is the end, or death separated from life.

00:58.671 --> 01:00.953
That does not come within our world picture.

01:01.658 --> 01:06.525
Do you think of these in terms of themes when you're writing the novellas?

01:06.585 --> 01:10.671
No, I think in terms of voices.

01:10.691 --> 01:14.196
What voices I would like for a given theme or a given story.

01:14.736 --> 01:20.725
Would it be for me the best voice, the most original voice, the most resonant voice?

01:20.745 --> 01:25.091
We're dealing with personas always, the masses, right?

01:26.092 --> 01:30.158
Did you conceive of this new book as novellas, five novellas?

01:30.459 --> 01:31.480
Yeah, but interlocked.

01:32.033 --> 01:32.594
Yeah.

01:32.994 --> 01:39.481
And with, of course, the central metaphor being the orange tree.

01:39.601 --> 01:41.723
The orange tree is nature witnessing.

01:41.743 --> 01:45.607
But it seems to be a metaphor for many, many things in this book.

01:45.647 --> 01:50.292
I guess, do we start?

01:50.552 --> 01:53.875
Do you start with this orange tree, this metaphor?

01:53.975 --> 01:54.676
No, it came.

01:54.816 --> 01:55.277
It came.

01:55.317 --> 02:00.522
The orange tree suddenly sprang from many grounds.

02:00.704 --> 02:02.366
I didn't imagine it that way.

02:02.386 --> 02:07.291
I didn't know when I began writing the first story, which was The Two Shores, I had no idea.

02:07.852 --> 02:09.513
There would be four of the stories.

02:09.533 --> 02:11.415
I had no idea there would be an orange tree.

02:11.756 --> 02:13.818
No.

02:14.058 --> 02:16.801
What a wonderful interview with you in The Letters of Work.

02:17.542 --> 02:18.242
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

02:18.282 --> 02:19.784
And it goes back a few years.

02:19.844 --> 02:21.266
I think it's 1981.

02:21.566 --> 02:21.746
Yeah.

02:21.886 --> 02:22.046
Right.

02:22.667 --> 02:25.650
And in fact, I think that you were working on this book at that time.

02:25.690 --> 02:27.272
On Christopher Unborn, yeah.

02:27.292 --> 02:30.255
And you really didn't want to say that much about it.

02:30.623 --> 02:36.669
But you also said that you see all of your books as more or less cut from whole files.

02:36.689 --> 02:57.171
Well, yes, they're part of a whole series of novels, a fictional fresco, if you want to call it, called The Age of Time, which is 28 novels, of which I've written 19 up till now, 19 titles, and which is appearing under the...

02:57.607 --> 03:01.672
sign of Alfaguara, which is a great publishing house in Spain and Mexico.

03:01.712 --> 03:05.476
They're publishing the first volume in May.

03:07.358 --> 03:09.841
You really can see ahead this far?

03:10.121 --> 03:11.603
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:12.064 --> 03:17.690
At a given moment in your career, you can't see the throw between all your work.

03:17.750 --> 03:18.511
You must see it.

03:19.092 --> 03:20.273
There are writers who see that.

03:20.293 --> 03:21.595
There are other writers who don't.

03:21.895 --> 03:25.059
I mean, you're Balzac or you're Flaubert kind of writer.

03:25.099 --> 03:26.280
I'm more of a Balzacian.

03:26.615 --> 03:32.621
and the writer who can see the consolation, the unity between the several works.

03:32.641 --> 03:42.390
I read in a review of this book here that in the Spanish edition there is a subtitle, The Circles of Time.

03:42.410 --> 03:43.251
That's right, yes.

03:43.572 --> 03:48.637
And I wonder if you could first explain that a bit, and then tell me why we don't have it.

03:48.657 --> 03:54.242
It's about a Spanish author, because a critic had written a book of essays called The Circles of Time,

03:54.442 --> 03:55.183
and sued me.

03:56.204 --> 03:59.287
I had no idea she had done this book.

03:59.307 --> 04:00.568
And I said, you don't have to sue me.

04:00.588 --> 04:01.669
I'll simply drop the title.

04:01.709 --> 04:02.830
It's not that important.

04:02.850 --> 04:06.113
I thought there was an editorial reason.

04:06.273 --> 04:07.434
No, no, no.

04:07.534 --> 04:13.640
It was a legal question, but I agreed wholeheartedly not to use the subtitle.

04:13.660 --> 04:14.761
What the hell?

04:14.841 --> 04:23.790
I don't know how it is in Mexico or Spain, but you cannot copyright a title in this country.

04:24.260 --> 04:25.762
Nobody has a copyright on a title.

04:25.782 --> 04:26.963
Oh, in Mexico you do.

04:26.983 --> 04:27.323
You do.

04:27.463 --> 04:28.044
Oh, yes, absolutely.

04:28.084 --> 04:30.847
I mean, if I wanted to call a book Gone with the Wind... You could do it.

04:30.867 --> 04:35.331
...how foolish enough to do it, you could do it, you know.

04:35.351 --> 04:37.233
Well, well... But she was going to sue you.

04:37.273 --> 04:42.298
Well, bless Obligio, it was a lady, so I said, keep your title, be happy with it, I won't take it away.

04:42.318 --> 04:44.981
But did you like the Circles of Time?

04:45.141 --> 04:50.166
Yeah, because the whole series is called The Age of Time, so it's always a reference to time.

04:50.433 --> 05:16.609
the time element and uh well if i can put it into the title it's okay but it's not indispensable do you find your vision changing from book to book yes of course of course the book teaches you a lot teaches the author a lot you're educating yourself constantly uh in what respect would you say i mean for example the vision changes even in um

05:16.960 --> 05:32.438
in a retrospective way because you end up by writing the books you wanted to write when you were a young man and didn't know how to.

05:34.521 --> 05:38.205
The Old Gringo is a novel that I conceived when I was 17 years old.

05:39.447 --> 05:41.309
I read the tales of Ambrose Bierce.

05:41.389 --> 05:46.275
I found it very striking that he was a writer who had written

05:46.610 --> 05:52.398
the best stories of the American Civil War, I think, in the midst of life, stories of soldiers and civilians.

05:53.239 --> 05:56.603
And we've come to die in our own civil war in Mexico.

05:56.623 --> 05:57.625
It struck me very much.

05:57.985 --> 06:04.213
And I started jotting down things about beers in Mexico and crossing the desert.

06:04.233 --> 06:14.507
Then I made a trip up Chihuahua, where we died and saw the desert and wrote more in 1964.

06:14.774 --> 06:18.398
And then until 1980, I had the complete vision of the novel.

06:18.718 --> 06:21.822
It took me all that time.

06:22.062 --> 06:30.551
And there it was a conscious fact, but how many novels are brewing within you ever since you were Carlos Unborn?

06:30.811 --> 06:31.632
Thank you.

06:31.652 --> 06:32.153
I'm sure.

06:34.035 --> 06:44.646
You know, the point of Christopher Unborn is that an unborn child has all the rings of memory.

06:44.812 --> 06:45.973
in his hands.

06:46.854 --> 06:49.557
He can remember his whole genetic catalog.

06:49.797 --> 06:51.919
Way, way, way, way back.

06:51.939 --> 06:54.842
The DNA, as far as it goes, he remembers it.

06:55.703 --> 06:59.407
And then the condition for being born is to forget everything.

07:00.128 --> 07:10.498
And that is why there is the Jewish tradition of the angel coming down upon you when you're born and hitting you right here and creating this

07:11.390 --> 07:21.461
You know, there's this dent between this cleft, which is the sign of the angel of amnesia, the angel of forgetfulness, that has hit you, that now you have to begin all over again.

07:21.501 --> 07:33.013
Now, you mentioned General Spears, and I had read that, he's an American, and that you, although your English is excellent, how many languages?

07:33.273 --> 07:36.857
Five, yeah, I'm one of those.

07:36.837 --> 07:56.221
Yeah, I have that kind of problem, yes, yes.

07:57.903 --> 08:02.549
With myself into the speech and the mind of Ambrose Beers, it was quite a feat.

08:02.569 --> 08:05.292
Many, many people have, you know,

08:05.828 --> 08:27.324
You were asked also if you ever thought of writing in English, and I mean, that's, that's, that's... Only communication, essays, journalism, literature.

08:27.505 --> 08:28.266
No, impossible.

08:28.306 --> 08:30.229
I don't mean in English.

08:30.249 --> 08:30.790
No way.

08:31.141 --> 08:32.663
And you actually do dream in a language.

08:32.683 --> 08:34.365
Oh, yes.

08:34.426 --> 08:42.897
Consult your dreams and you see.

08:42.917 --> 08:45.561
This is a very funny book.

08:45.581 --> 08:46.803
I mean, you smile.

08:47.283 --> 08:48.124
I hope so.

08:48.144 --> 08:48.505
I hope so.

08:48.886 --> 08:50.167
That is my intention.

08:50.187 --> 08:51.649
The themes are deep.

08:52.030 --> 08:54.373
No question about this.

08:54.894 --> 08:57.958
And I think that people who don't know your writing probably

08:58.934 --> 09:05.642
I mean, are you a naturally funny man?

09:05.662 --> 09:10.448
I don't know, but I'm funny.

09:10.808 --> 09:19.118
My children think so.

09:19.418 --> 09:26.106
They've always thought I was very funny.

09:27.183 --> 09:32.550
which makes them lose some respect for me.

09:32.570 --> 09:34.493
Who do you hope to reach with these novels?

09:35.194 --> 09:39.239
Well, listen, this has been a highly successful book in the Spanish language.

09:39.259 --> 09:42.703
It has sold 100,000 copies in a year in Spanish.

09:42.964 --> 09:53.378
And I know it has reached so many people who see in it a kind of song to the origins of our culture, to who we are.

09:53.978 --> 09:56.802
We're in a process, I think, in Latin America...

09:56.950 --> 10:02.858
of thinking less how many are we and more who are we.

10:02.878 --> 10:09.907
There's a big question about who we are, where we come from, what we mean as we reach the millennium.

10:09.927 --> 10:13.812
That's why so much historical fiction is being written.

10:13.832 --> 10:24.105
There are many, many writers who are taking the historical thing as though we wanted to have a balance before the new millennium begins.

10:24.423 --> 10:35.156
I think the book has reached so many people in Spain and Latin America precisely because of the nature of the themes, because of the insistence on the birth of the culture, the birth of the nation, the origins.

10:36.238 --> 10:43.527
Do you feel a move to... I mean, you are rewriting history in some respects, too.

10:44.207 --> 10:45.549
Tell me a little bit about that.

10:45.569 --> 10:52.017
I mean, are you rewriting history in a... Well, history has been rewritten, too.

10:52.418 --> 10:53.780
It's not that I rewrite it.

10:53.800 --> 10:55.842
History is going to be written every single day.

10:56.282 --> 10:59.906
There would be no history if we didn't rethink it, rewrite it, relive it.

11:00.367 --> 11:04.471
If we were just stuck with a bunch of arid facts, there would be no history.

11:04.491 --> 11:05.252
We were forgotten.

11:05.272 --> 11:13.641
Then we remember history because we desire it, because we experience it, because we live it today.

11:14.322 --> 11:16.845
It is the history we live today that matters, after all.

11:16.865 --> 11:20.569
And that is a history open to many, many interpretations.

11:20.802 --> 11:31.979
García Márquez was telling me that he recently had a talk with Frederick Forsythe, because García Márquez is writing a novel of terrorism in Colombia.

11:33.502 --> 11:38.389
And, well, he admires the day of the jackals very much.

11:39.170 --> 11:48.325
And he had this talk, and he told Forsythe, you know, I think it's a great book, the mechanics work very well, but it's not really the great book it could have been for one reason.

11:48.345 --> 11:49.206
Watch it, Forsythe.

11:49.540 --> 11:52.424
And Guzmachia, you did not kill General de Gaulle.

11:53.545 --> 11:56.449
If only you had done that, you would have written a great novel.

11:56.849 --> 12:02.577
And a hundred years from now, everybody would be convinced that de Gaulle was assassinated.

12:02.597 --> 12:04.619
You missed your point.

12:04.639 --> 12:16.675
You see, there is an argument also that one reason that is an excellent thriller is that even though we know how it turns out, he still manages to grip us to find out how it turns out.

12:16.695 --> 12:19.058
Guzmachia admits that, but he insists on the point...

12:19.578 --> 12:25.908
Of the next step that would have made it a great novel, an unforgettable novel, and a true novel.

12:26.489 --> 12:27.871
That's funny.

12:29.213 --> 12:33.360
You said once that being a bureaucrat taught you how to write.

12:35.363 --> 12:36.485
No, no, being a lawyer.

12:36.525 --> 12:39.670
Oh, well, and I know what you mean, Ted.

12:40.531 --> 12:44.117
Whatever, being in public service, let's put it that way, or...

12:44.384 --> 12:56.842
Well, it made me hunger so much for writing that I just wanted to get away from it and find my time for writing.

12:57.122 --> 13:14.307
But then studying law also is a very good lesson for a writer, because I think it was Stendhal who said that the French Civil Code, the Code Napoléon, is probably the best model a novelist has for structure and order.

13:15.029 --> 13:17.672
and exposition, probably he's right.

13:18.073 --> 13:24.020
But I appreciate all the things I've done in my life.

13:24.040 --> 13:28.785
I think I've all been able to channel them all into literature, finally.

13:28.805 --> 13:29.826
I'm glad about that.

13:31.068 --> 13:35.673
You've also been quoted as saying that you do not feel that as a whiter you represent Mexico?

13:36.414 --> 13:36.915
Of course not.

13:37.035 --> 13:38.196
I'm just an individual.

13:38.977 --> 13:39.097
Right.

13:39.117 --> 13:40.539
I don't represent a country.

13:40.579 --> 13:44.023
Nobody cares you represent a country, and if you think you represent a country, you're in trouble.

13:44.459 --> 13:51.446
Well, there are many writers in Mexico.

13:51.546 --> 13:56.470
Indeed, and there are also many great writers in Latin America.

13:58.032 --> 14:11.665
And I think that you have said that you are brothers and sisters, I guess, in that respect.

14:12.134 --> 14:18.861
Yeah, that's another thing I've said is that we are writing the same novel.

14:19.622 --> 14:27.470
We're writing one big Latin American saga with a Colombian chapter by García Márquez, a Peruvian chapter by Vargas Llosa, etc.

14:29.512 --> 14:35.779
And also, I think another thing that you've expressed is that

14:37.598 --> 15:05.142
the english novel of course has one the novel in english has one in uninterrupted history yeah whereas you know you start with uh there's nothing afterwards very little after absolutely yeah and then you kind of pick up again uh right with uh almost with a vengeance of the 20th century i guess that's right and that has a lot to do with uh

15:06.421 --> 15:08.043
what independence meant for us.

15:08.063 --> 15:14.011
It meant denying that we had an Indian and an African and an Iberian past.

15:14.031 --> 15:15.433
We were kind of ashamed of them.

15:15.453 --> 15:20.659
These are barbaric or backward-looking traditions.

15:21.020 --> 15:23.443
We wanted to be Europeans as soon as possible.

15:23.743 --> 15:24.845
We wanted to look forward.

15:25.305 --> 15:30.973
So we adapted the literary traditions of the moment in Europe, realism, naturalism.

15:30.993 --> 15:35.078
And through them we could not recover the wealth of the Indian

15:36.239 --> 15:38.462
and African and Iberian traditions.

15:38.482 --> 15:41.005
Once we did that, we started writing very good novels.

15:42.106 --> 15:46.431
I think you've also said, though, that the poets kind of... Yeah.

15:46.451 --> 15:50.516
There is an uninterrupted line of poetry throughout Latin America.

15:50.536 --> 15:56.223
Things, colonial times, great Baroque poets of the 16th, 17th century.

15:56.243 --> 15:58.846
They kept the torture of literature alive.

16:00.167 --> 16:04.272
The Spanish colony did not admit the writing or publication of novels.

16:04.842 --> 16:09.228
They were considered dangerous, dissolving, immoral.

16:09.248 --> 16:17.020
So the first novel written in Latin America appeared in 1821, The Itching Parrot by Jorando de Lusatari.

16:17.040 --> 16:20.625
And it was a kind of picaresque tale.

16:20.645 --> 16:31.741
But the tradition then is recent and therefore weak, whereas the tradition of poetry comes all the way from the colony.

16:31.761 --> 16:34.545
I've read where you've said that you

16:34.812 --> 16:36.033
You can write about your obsessions.

16:37.014 --> 16:37.415
Who doesn't?

16:37.975 --> 16:38.876
Every writer, I think.

16:38.896 --> 16:40.257
But you're obsessed.

16:40.277 --> 16:42.139
Every writer is obsessed.

16:42.199 --> 16:45.062
And I wonder if you could tell me something about your obsessions.

16:45.082 --> 16:56.253
Well, many of my obsessions have to do with the intersection of personal life and history.

16:57.114 --> 16:59.716
The way they intersect, the way they affect each other.

17:00.297 --> 17:02.279
It has to do with the uses of time.

17:02.359 --> 17:03.520
What is time?

17:03.787 --> 17:05.070
How do you employ time?

17:05.170 --> 17:07.194
How do time affect you?

17:07.214 --> 17:10.761
How does one live under time?

17:12.485 --> 17:25.491
I'm very obsessed by the capacity for creating another world through imagination, a world that

17:25.758 --> 17:41.005
is not a reflection of reality, but that adds something that did not exist before, which I think is the great challenge of the artist to read and write the unwritten and unread part of the world.

17:41.025 --> 17:48.559
Just as the plastic artist sees the unseen or invisible part of the world, or the great musician the unheard part of the world,

17:48.860 --> 17:51.083
That is the contribution of the artist.

17:51.103 --> 17:54.008
Something that did not exist before is suddenly there.

17:54.348 --> 17:56.832
Did the Ninth Symphony exist before it was written?

17:57.153 --> 17:59.336
Did Don Quixote exist before it was written?

17:59.396 --> 18:00.318
Or David Copperfield?

18:00.338 --> 18:07.909
No, they're there because of the intuition and art and imagination of the writer and author.

18:08.009 --> 18:13.237
Trying to explain the creative process is almost impossible.

18:13.257 --> 18:15.140
It's almost impossible, but there you are.

18:15.160 --> 18:16.943
The products are there, and they remain.

18:17.716 --> 18:23.324
We were all going to die, but these works of art remain, and it was a great homage to humanity, I think.

18:24.085 --> 18:25.648
Do you re-lead your own works?

18:25.688 --> 18:26.529
Never, never, never.

18:26.969 --> 18:27.711
They're like children.

18:27.751 --> 18:30.134
They cut the umbilical cord, and out they go.

18:31.216 --> 18:33.980
They're no longer yours, once you're written.

18:34.080 --> 18:38.546
I mean, there are... Can I say something else?

18:38.606 --> 18:43.133
So there's never a thought that, gee, I mean, it's probably...

18:43.231 --> 18:44.973
When you're done, you're happy with it.

18:44.993 --> 18:47.257
You're not repentant to me.

18:47.297 --> 18:50.822
Maybe I am repentant of a few things and a few books, of course, yes.

18:50.842 --> 18:52.123
But I won't touch them.

18:52.484 --> 18:53.165
Do you do readings?

18:53.866 --> 18:58.452
Some of my kids are cross-eyed and albino.

18:58.472 --> 18:58.853
I don't care.

18:58.873 --> 18:59.654
They're mine.

18:59.674 --> 19:00.175
I love them.

19:00.195 --> 19:01.236
Do you do public readings?

19:01.697 --> 19:02.138
Yeah.

19:02.158 --> 19:03.059
I'm doing one tomorrow.

19:03.660 --> 19:07.445
When you're reading, do you ever say... Yeah.

19:07.465 --> 19:08.867
I start collecting myself.

19:08.999 --> 19:10.882
I started reading other things around there.

19:11.262 --> 19:12.504
Change the words a little bit.

19:12.564 --> 19:14.667
As you go along.

19:14.747 --> 19:18.953
You know a lot.

19:19.233 --> 19:19.493
Uh-oh.

19:19.954 --> 19:21.937
That's right.

19:22.277 --> 19:23.839
What other writers do you read?

19:24.941 --> 19:26.964
Do you read other writers, I guess, for pleasure?

19:27.504 --> 19:31.830
Or as more or less a professional?

19:31.850 --> 19:34.894
I'm a great poetry reader.

19:35.615 --> 19:37.538
Poetry feeds me and nourishes me.

19:38.125 --> 19:39.948
very much poetry of all the ages.

19:41.850 --> 19:45.736
Then I read, more and more I re-read.

19:46.837 --> 19:54.788
As I grow older, I go back to books I've loved, or I read great books that I haven't read, and I feel guilty about it.

19:55.629 --> 19:56.551
I want to read them.

19:56.991 --> 20:01.838
Then I feel, not an obligation, but a pleasure in reading my contemporaries.

20:02.341 --> 20:07.032
and a special obligation to read what's new in Latin American literature.

20:07.053 --> 20:12.807
Because we are so uncommunicated and so much talent appears and nobody notices it.

20:13.167 --> 20:17.498
But I like to send clarion calls when I discover

20:17.748 --> 20:22.113
Very good writers, as in this last trip I made to South America in Chile and Argentina.

20:22.614 --> 20:25.177
Chile has a bevy of wonderful new novelists.

20:25.257 --> 20:26.138
So does Argentina.

20:26.198 --> 20:28.020
Nobody knows them outside their countries.

20:28.281 --> 20:31.204
So I try to call attention to them, but that means I have to read them first.

20:31.264 --> 20:32.005
It's very hard.

20:32.185 --> 20:36.010
I know in the United States, for some reason, it's almost xenophobia here.

20:36.030 --> 20:37.111
I mean, it's very hard.

20:37.993 --> 20:39.314
It's not xenophobia.

20:39.394 --> 20:43.800
But in many ways, it's so hard for fallen writers to be read here.

20:44.180 --> 20:45.021
It's a big risk.

20:45.558 --> 20:47.861
It's a big risk for a publisher.

20:48.061 --> 20:50.023
A translation is costly.

20:50.043 --> 20:51.165
And then will the book develop?

20:51.525 --> 20:53.327
Good translations are costly.

20:53.688 --> 20:59.735
And then the flip side of that is bad translations can destroy the good work, can't they?

21:00.195 --> 21:02.638
Well, that is one of the themes of the orange screen.

21:02.658 --> 21:03.119
Exactly.

21:03.179 --> 21:04.421
Translators.

21:04.481 --> 21:05.061
Creators.

21:07.765 --> 21:09.827
Now, tell me a little bit about it.

21:09.847 --> 21:14.873
I mean, I hate to, by the way, I'm deliberately not discussing the books because the books

21:15.190 --> 21:32.452
I have to say that as an interviewer, the most challenging interviews are with the novelists, because we talk about things generally outside of the work, as far as I'm concerned.

21:32.472 --> 21:37.799
Because if you come prepared, you read the books, and the books speak for themselves.

21:38.039 --> 21:43.426
But I guess translation is decidedly a theme.

21:43.466 --> 21:44.387
What do you think?

21:44.637 --> 21:47.602
I mean, are you poking fun?

21:47.622 --> 21:49.946
Is it history or is it crap?

21:50.027 --> 21:50.708
No, no, no.

21:50.768 --> 21:59.423
The fact is that I'm very struck by the fact that Mexico is a country founded by translators.

21:59.443 --> 22:07.337
Because if the Spaniards had not found translators into the Indian languages and from the Indian languages into Spanish, they would have gotten nowhere.

22:08.887 --> 22:12.190
But the translators have their own agenda.

22:12.650 --> 22:16.293
The agenda of this translator, Jerónimo de Aguilar, was to make Cortés fail.

22:17.434 --> 22:24.681
And every time Cortés tells the Indians, I come in peace, I am your friend, you say he comes in war, he wants to enslave you.

22:24.701 --> 22:26.742
But it turns out the lie was the truth.

22:27.183 --> 22:31.246
So where are you?

22:32.828 --> 22:38.893
I hate to come across that you have an earlier interview, but I'm 15 years old, and they do

22:39.751 --> 22:47.785
I do fascinate some of the statements that you made that you said that you wanted that all of your books are about fear.

22:51.631 --> 22:51.791
Hmm.

22:51.832 --> 22:57.601
Maybe I will... No, no, maybe I was thinking of Kafka more than a master.

22:57.722 --> 23:00.005
That was about 81 when you said that.

23:00.025 --> 23:04.493
Yeah, because I've just written a novel called Distant Relationship.

23:04.928 --> 23:12.062
I think there's a more playful fact.

23:12.162 --> 23:13.745
No, no, no.

23:13.825 --> 23:21.880
I would backtrack on that one.

23:21.900 --> 23:28.152
I told Big Cat is that.

23:28.688 --> 23:35.616
very often in your writing.

23:35.736 --> 23:40.902
That's a question of image, I guess.

23:40.922 --> 23:43.545
Did you get much criticism from women?

23:43.566 --> 23:52.316
Yeah, I've gotten a bit, but I'm writing from the heart of a very macho-oriented culture.

23:52.396 --> 23:57.582
When I'm expressing the point of view of a character, or what a character is looking for,

23:58.169 --> 24:12.628
We have lived tradition, it's no longer true, let me say it right away, but we have lived tradition in a society where a woman is seen as a nun or as a whore, and nothing in between.

24:14.310 --> 24:18.595
Or, as we say in Mexico, my mother is a saint.

24:19.536 --> 24:23.822
All the other women are whores, your mother included.

24:23.842 --> 24:25.264
That'll get you good fight, won't it?

24:25.384 --> 24:26.185
Yeah.

24:26.688 --> 24:37.302
But now this is changing, of course, because women are playing such an important role in the professions, in politics, in all literature, all walks of life.

24:37.322 --> 24:44.411
The most successful novelist ever in the history of Mexico is Laura Esquivel, the author of Black Water for Chocolate.

24:44.431 --> 24:44.871
She's a woman.

24:46.693 --> 24:48.536
And she said a very funny thing.

24:48.616 --> 24:56.526
She was interviewed in Spain, and since the book is about cooking and all this, she was asked...

24:57.080 --> 25:03.529
And then, is it true that cooking is a woman's second uterus?

25:04.971 --> 25:11.220
And she answered, no, cooking is the only way women have of penetrating men.

25:12.542 --> 25:15.286
Very interesting.

25:15.306 --> 25:19.712
You know, Harvard, about two years ago, published two volumes.

25:19.732 --> 25:24.319
I saw one, and I had a chance to read it.

25:25.109 --> 25:36.525
Well, there you are, the most important figure of our literature, probably.

25:36.585 --> 25:42.333
All our literature is a nun, a woman.

25:42.353 --> 25:44.076
Yes.

25:44.376 --> 25:47.400
But her work is a resonance, a body of work.

25:47.480 --> 25:49.243
I mean, it hasn't lost a thing.

25:49.463 --> 25:51.025
Oh, no, it's totally modern.

25:51.105 --> 25:54.390
It's as good as modern Shakespeare, let's say.

25:55.484 --> 26:05.279
Again, talking about a dead man's recollections, and it's kind of an interesting thing, too, isn't it?

26:05.299 --> 26:09.205
As a letter, I would just actually think in terms of a dead man narrating.

26:09.525 --> 26:21.263
Well, it's as audacious as putting yourself into the head of Richard III, or any other character.

26:21.283 --> 26:24.748
It is an act of boldness.

26:25.133 --> 26:31.581
They say, I dare enter the head of a criminal called Raskolnikov, and imagine it goes on.

26:32.122 --> 26:35.246
It's the same thing.

26:35.266 --> 26:42.635
I suppose, except that when we think of death, it is a... Well, you think of death as an extinction, but I don't.

26:43.176 --> 26:44.257
Well, that's an important point.

26:44.278 --> 26:48.603
And I'm not really mature now.

26:48.683 --> 26:50.145
Although I like it very much.

26:50.581 --> 26:55.005
Well, we're covering things quickly here, I have to say.

26:55.206 --> 26:56.907
Are you comfortable with the novella form?

26:57.028 --> 26:58.049
Very comfortable.

26:58.289 --> 26:59.730
Very, very comfortable.

26:59.750 --> 27:06.397
And I'm comfortable with the fact that in this country, the rears are not comfortable with the novella form.

27:06.417 --> 27:08.019
They don't like it very much.

27:08.079 --> 27:08.379
Why?

27:08.759 --> 27:09.160
I don't know.

27:09.180 --> 27:19.170
Mary Gordon did a collection of novellas last year, which I thought were for, I can't think of the title.

27:19.370 --> 27:35.166
You know, this, this is, uh, along with the Russians, you are the people that have written the best novellas in the world.

27:35.867 --> 27:39.470
There's a form that is perfected by the Russians and by the North Americans.

27:40.071 --> 27:47.098
When you think of James and Faulkner, and, uh,

27:47.838 --> 27:54.105
I think one of the most perfect novellas ever written is The Pilgrim Rock by Glenway Westcott.

27:54.826 --> 27:56.267
It is absolute perfection.

27:57.068 --> 27:58.490
And I can name many, many more.

27:58.510 --> 27:59.551
Yes please.

28:00.773 --> 28:06.038
Don't think of the death of Ivan Illich and the duel by Chekhov.

28:06.339 --> 28:10.804
The Russians and the North Americans are the great masters of the form.

28:10.824 --> 28:13.727
Why do you suppose that is?

28:15.648 --> 28:19.874
The novella has a maritime familiarity.

28:21.537 --> 28:34.797
You write a short story, you're really in a lake with a paddle boat.

28:34.817 --> 28:41.166
You are writing a novel, you are taking the transatlantic into deep waters across the oceans.

28:41.365 --> 28:47.371
But if you're writing a novella, you are in a yacht or a catch or a sailboat, hugging the shore.

28:47.811 --> 28:50.754
You see the shore and you see the horizon at the same time.

28:51.154 --> 28:56.679
It is a form of equilibrium, I assume, equilibrium of the soul, which is very satisfying.

28:58.200 --> 29:05.727
It permits you to get to the poem quickly, not to lose too much time in psychology or character development or inscription.

29:05.767 --> 29:07.649
You can't do all these things in a novella.

29:08.090 --> 29:10.832
You have to find the essence of the story very, very quickly.

29:11.150 --> 29:12.291
A short story is something else.

29:12.312 --> 29:13.373
It's like a telegram, no?

29:13.753 --> 29:14.414
Your mother died.

29:14.855 --> 29:16.477
That's a short story.

29:16.497 --> 29:18.399
It's one character in general.

29:21.063 --> 29:23.906
I love the idea of connecting with five.

29:24.327 --> 29:27.051
It really does make it one book.

29:27.071 --> 29:35.942
It does make it one book, but I hope all readers are as intelligent as you are and see that connection.

29:36.462 --> 29:44.142
For example, many people have criticized me in the Hispanic world for the Capuza story, saying it doesn't belong in this story.

29:44.162 --> 29:53.526
I think it does belong, because the movie star is a modern conquistador, and because the women, especially in Spanish, are using a language, which is the language,

29:53.708 --> 30:19.092
of the two sons of the conquistadores it is the language of the mestizos finally they have come into possession of a language that permits them to conquer the conquerors isn't it funny it never occurred to me that the story comes along it's been criticized for that you know and um i think it's uh also a story that permits me to link the stories because valera being a

30:19.477 --> 30:26.143
a movie actor who can, in depth, represent the parts of all the other characters of the other four novelas.

30:26.644 --> 30:29.987
So it ties many knots in that story.

30:30.487 --> 30:32.709
It was based on an actual fat story.

30:32.729 --> 30:33.110
I didn't know that.

30:33.410 --> 30:43.940
Steve Cochran was the actor, played gangster roles in James Caggins, things like that, and got a big opportunity with Antonioni in the film In Italy.

30:43.960 --> 30:47.543
And then nobody used him anymore, and finally he went on a trip to Acapulco,

30:47.725 --> 31:06.985
And then the yard was left to drift because they couldn't, the women couldn't maneuver.

31:07.685 --> 31:15.133
And it was finally found in Salvador by the Coast Guard, there was a dead actor there, about five days later.

31:15.383 --> 31:18.546
It's a very true story.

31:18.646 --> 31:23.551
I didn't realize that it had a foundation.

31:23.711 --> 31:27.215
Let's see.

31:27.235 --> 31:35.523
I have, I really hope that you have about 45 minutes and I don't know what else to do.

31:35.543 --> 31:40.108
You have too much of your time to answer a lot of questions.

31:44.071 --> 32:00.586
I guess one, the overwhelming, maybe if you could just give me a quote on your thoughts on the role of language, your sense of philosophy and the role of language in your country's history.

32:00.606 --> 32:12.137
Well, I think in every single society, you don't have a language, you don't have a nation, you don't have a society, you don't have

32:12.421 --> 32:16.947
You don't have politics, you don't have science, you don't have education, you don't have anything.

32:17.267 --> 32:27.000
So I think the writer's role in any society to keep alive the vitality of the language, meaningfulness of the language, is essential.

32:27.361 --> 32:31.306
It's not the powers that be tend to kidnap languages.

32:31.326 --> 32:33.489
They love doing that.

32:33.549 --> 32:36.673
The most terrible example perhaps in the 20th century is Hitler.

32:37.261 --> 32:44.611
He managed to absolutely abduct the language of the German people, corrupt it completely, and leave them mute.

32:44.631 --> 32:56.467
And I think it was Gunter Grass who said, well, we had to restore a great language that had been banalized beyond recognition by the Nazi regime.

32:57.128 --> 33:01.935
And I think writers like Solzhenitsyn and the Soviet Union have had the same experience.

33:02.135 --> 33:07.461
In Latin America, we have that experience of the corruption of the language by political power over time.

33:07.921 --> 33:11.725
And here, although sometimes you don't realize it, the same thing happens.

33:11.806 --> 33:18.413
When you get 80 years of Ronald Reagan sputtering the things he said, something happens to the language.

33:18.733 --> 33:19.354
It's banalized.

33:19.374 --> 33:21.296
I think something happens to the language.

33:21.316 --> 33:22.277
Terribly banalized.

33:22.297 --> 33:30.446
So it's very important for a writer to come back and fight for the meaningfulness of the language, the beauty of the language, the sense of the language.

33:30.466 --> 33:31.467
I think it's so essential.

33:32.071 --> 33:33.533
It is a great social function.

33:33.633 --> 33:34.615
You can't get away from that.

33:35.035 --> 33:38.080
Have you entered the word processor generation?

33:39.522 --> 33:40.524
Very old-fashioned.

33:41.425 --> 33:42.186
I'm very old-fashioned.

33:42.206 --> 33:44.550
I write by hand my first draft.

33:44.570 --> 33:47.975
Then I go on to a very old-fashioned machine.

33:49.036 --> 33:52.742
Then I give it to my daughter, who's a wonderful computer.

33:54.224 --> 33:56.307
She does it beautifully as I am.

33:56.725 --> 34:01.674
But now she's gone on to produce television, so she doesn't take care of my manuscripts anymore.

34:01.694 --> 34:03.056
I'll have to learn.

34:03.076 --> 34:05.460
But do you do revisions on the, what?

34:05.721 --> 34:08.786
Do you continue revisions when it's on the word process?

34:08.806 --> 34:10.990
No, I never see the word process.

34:11.090 --> 34:12.953
Oh, so really, it's done.

34:12.973 --> 34:14.496
It gizzes me.

34:14.516 --> 34:15.498
It gives me a headache.

34:15.938 --> 34:17.180
So I see sheets.

34:17.261 --> 34:19.164
I see sheets, galleys.

34:19.264 --> 34:21.568
I correct the way I've always done it.

34:21.835 --> 34:24.462
Are you painstaking whiter?

34:25.043 --> 34:26.026
No, no, no.

34:26.046 --> 34:27.910
I have a stage of the writing here.

34:27.930 --> 34:29.494
I confess that.

34:29.514 --> 34:29.996
It blows up.

34:30.016 --> 34:30.377
Excuse me.

34:30.998 --> 34:31.901
I think a lot.

34:32.041 --> 34:33.144
I lay in my head.

34:33.164 --> 34:33.685
It's what I do.

34:34.238 --> 34:44.317
I read that when you were living in Princeton you used to give yourself a good walk in the afternoon.

34:44.457 --> 34:45.219
You know that.

34:45.319 --> 34:48.044
It's like a triangle.

34:48.165 --> 34:51.751
You work out the creative process and come back.

34:51.852 --> 34:56.280
In Princeton I learned to write in my head and gain much of time.

34:56.260 --> 35:00.333
I think it had to deal with this Terry Waite.

35:00.875 --> 35:03.564
They wouldn't even let him read.

35:03.805 --> 35:05.410
He couldn't have a pencil.

35:05.744 --> 35:07.807
He wrote the whole book in his life.

35:07.827 --> 35:13.917
It was really good experience to talk to a writer who actually wrote the entire book in his life.

35:13.977 --> 35:16.201
He had a wonderful job, I think.

35:16.221 --> 35:17.784
Marvelous.

35:18.044 --> 35:22.010
Do you remember the Gregory's story, Fahrenheit?

35:22.030 --> 35:22.231
451.

35:22.251 --> 35:23.853
451 were books being banned.

35:23.873 --> 35:29.743
The character becomes Treasure Island, another one becomes Oliver Twist, and they learn the

35:30.010 --> 35:37.663
You know, there's a Roman precedent for that.

35:37.703 --> 35:40.788
I just finished writing a book about bibliomania, by the way.

35:41.108 --> 35:47.479
It was published by Henry Holt early next year.

35:47.695 --> 35:51.220
You know, the Romans were great collectors.

35:51.640 --> 35:53.603
They built great libraries.

35:54.183 --> 35:59.891
There was one Roman who was actually a very wealthy guy who had slaves with beautiful voices.

35:59.911 --> 36:08.402
And one slave would be, he'd be, you know, another one would be, some people had books, they had living books, and they'd have their dinner.

36:08.422 --> 36:09.403
Oh, that's wonderful.

36:09.423 --> 36:11.025
Well, that's a bad idea.

36:11.045 --> 36:12.968
It was a bad idea.

36:12.988 --> 36:14.530
It was a pretty, uh,

36:14.510 --> 36:27.966
Well, you know, one of the stories between Omancius as Scipio, the general of Scat, the principal character, and he was actually around his circle in Rome with Polybius and Terence, the playwright.

36:27.986 --> 36:30.713
It was the origin of Latin literature.

36:31.503 --> 36:48.343
And I tell that story in one of the novellas, which is the origin of Latin rhetoric, which is the origin of the Spanish language or such.

36:48.363 --> 36:53.829
You know what, I think that I've got plenty of material, and I'm not going to take up too much of your time.

36:53.889 --> 36:57.814
I wonder if you do me the honors.

36:58.587 --> 37:00.852
Do you miss being involved in public rights?

37:00.872 --> 37:02.275
I am involved in public rights.

37:02.295 --> 37:03.298
To what degree now?

37:03.618 --> 37:17.490
The degree of being commentator, critic, journalist, very close to Mexican politics, talking to political people.

37:19.073 --> 37:24.995
So I feel very close to the public life, especially when things are moving so much in Mexico.

37:26.240 --> 37:30.095
Especially with that tragedy over the last couple of weeks.

37:30.295 --> 37:30.737
Oh, that's good.
