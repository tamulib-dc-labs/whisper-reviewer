WEBVTT

00:02.630 --> 00:07.476
standing room only, sometimes we take whizzed care of books.

00:07.496 --> 00:19.692
Even when people bring stuff here, you know, if they just want to show it to us, but if it's not well cared for, I send them away with a box or something like that, because I sort of think it's my job to take care of the books of the world.

00:19.813 --> 00:30.747
And one solander box is not going to break the bank of the Getty, and it seems like that's a good thing to do, to make sure the book is well cared for.

00:30.862 --> 00:44.156
And so if you can do that, you know, if you can show people how to take care of a book or how they should store it, that's a good thing to do, I think.

00:44.176 --> 00:48.921
Just to go off on the side of the dendrocks about making these situations.

00:48.941 --> 00:49.362
Books seem different.

00:49.382 --> 00:51.464
You're almost a custodian for these libraries.

00:51.904 --> 00:56.189
You always have thought that you own them, but you're to preserve and take care of them.

00:56.429 --> 00:57.370
Passing on it.

00:57.390 --> 00:57.510
Yeah.

00:57.530 --> 01:00.193
And they'll have another life beyond our own lives.

01:00.848 --> 01:16.585
I also think that some people initially were critical of our buying at auctions of great libraries, because they thought we were aiding the dispersion of great libraries.

01:17.987 --> 01:22.472
But I think books have these long lives, and they move through collections.

01:22.512 --> 01:25.675
The cycle of books is a long way to do.

01:26.077 --> 01:32.705
The Doheny Library, for instance, that was up in Camarillo, was a really amazing collection of books.

01:32.725 --> 01:34.447
It wasn't being taken care of.

01:35.088 --> 01:36.770
It wasn't being used.

01:36.790 --> 01:37.851
I mean, it was being taken care of.

01:37.871 --> 01:42.276
They couldn't wait for the twenty-five years to come up so they could sell it to be real.

01:42.296 --> 01:45.740
She said twenty-five years, and twenty-five years to the day they put it up.

01:46.181 --> 01:48.323
But they wanted it to be kept together initially.

01:48.543 --> 01:52.388
The diocese said that they wanted that as the Doheny Library.

01:52.537 --> 01:58.065
And I really think it's okay.

01:58.565 --> 02:07.918
Well, you get books out there, and you get them in places where they'll be conserved and appreciated and used appropriately.

02:07.999 --> 02:19.114
Working with other curious, we're not terribly pleased with the condition, but it's a really rare book.

02:19.655 --> 02:21.177
And so we can't find it

02:21.798 --> 02:22.479
anywhere.

02:22.539 --> 02:31.649
Part of the question is, how much do you want to pay for something that's not in excellent condition?

02:32.049 --> 02:34.672
But the big one is, should you let it go?

02:34.952 --> 02:36.814
Are you going to see it again?

02:36.835 --> 02:37.736
That's right.

02:37.756 --> 02:39.137
That's precisely what I argue.

02:40.979 --> 02:44.483
You would have to be a fortune teller to know that.

02:44.983 --> 02:48.227
At a certain point, we get together and just

02:49.068 --> 02:56.200
Some little group of us votes on it when we don't feel comfortable making our own decision.

02:56.220 --> 02:57.182
It is really hard.

02:57.743 --> 03:02.651
When it's a unique object, in some ways it's a little easier because you know you're not going to see this again.

03:02.711 --> 03:06.257
So with archives and things like that, it's a little bit easier.

03:06.958 --> 03:10.003
But one is a collection of photographs that we're working on.

03:10.164 --> 03:12.688
So we know there might be some out there, but photographs.

03:12.828 --> 03:14.451
These are 1860s.

03:14.988 --> 03:21.401
One is 1860s, one is 1880s albums, one is in a photographically illustrated book.

03:21.421 --> 03:25.088
That's a really hard one, and we're just kind of twisting about it.

03:25.108 --> 03:26.490
But condition is the key here?

03:26.631 --> 03:27.292
Oh, yeah.

03:27.312 --> 03:27.873
It's condition.

03:28.494 --> 03:36.490
Because we're not completely pleased with the condition, but we're not sure that we can think we're going to see this again.

03:37.499 --> 03:44.786
I mean, we all know why a condition is condition, but why should that be the determining factor here?

03:44.806 --> 03:51.072
Because in one case, in one of the books, the condition is not that great.

03:52.293 --> 04:07.067
And it's an important work that was published by a turn-of-the-century Vienna secessionist publisher who was known, he was the publisher of Ver Sacrum, this beautiful

04:07.199 --> 04:11.343
you know, special paper illustrated journal.

04:12.444 --> 04:17.029
And so you, for us, we want that in the best condition possible.

04:17.549 --> 04:18.550
And this one isn't.

04:18.570 --> 04:22.234
But when I was in New York, I looked at New York Public Library's copy.

04:23.055 --> 04:24.937
It's a portfolio of plates.

04:25.818 --> 04:29.041
They bound it in a brown buckram binding.

04:29.201 --> 04:31.403
They threw away the slipcase.

04:32.765 --> 04:33.625
Not NYTL.

04:34.086 --> 04:35.387
Yes.

04:35.407 --> 04:37.189
They did that.

04:38.030 --> 04:40.092
It's not their fault.

04:40.892 --> 04:47.959
They didn't understand, when they did that, that this was an important document of the secessionist publishers.

04:48.459 --> 04:51.482
No one had that point of view, say, even 20 years ago.

04:52.823 --> 04:57.887
I could go through lots of university libraries and find exactly the same thing.

04:57.907 --> 04:59.468
UCLA, any of them.

05:00.229 --> 05:02.071
They didn't have this view that we have.

05:02.851 --> 05:07.075
I think this view that prizes the object

05:07.527 --> 05:12.512
and it takes into account the history of the book and what it looked like originally, is very recent.

05:12.972 --> 05:13.373
Don't you?

05:14.554 --> 05:16.676
I think so.

05:16.696 --> 05:18.257
Because I only learned about that.

05:18.277 --> 05:28.908
I learned about it a little bit in terms of rare books from Lehmanhaupt, but then I only started to really apply it, I think, when I came here.

05:28.968 --> 05:35.374
And I had taught history of the book, and so I started to apply things that I used with

05:37.075 --> 05:44.807
say, 15th to 19th century books to 20th century books, because I realized these were designed.

05:44.867 --> 05:49.834
These were carefully produced books that are part of that general art movement.

05:49.854 --> 05:56.284
So they tell you about the development of the avant-garde and the history of modernism.

05:57.305 --> 06:05.277
When you can look at a car, you can look at a cereal box, you can look at a matchbook cover, and it'll tell you something

06:06.218 --> 06:10.484
a work on paper or a designed object, that the books will tell you as well.

06:11.105 --> 06:15.872
So that modernist evolution is really important to me.

06:16.312 --> 06:22.181
That whole concept of paratexts, the paratextual element of Jeanette is his name.

06:22.481 --> 06:24.063
You know the book that's called Paratext?

06:24.284 --> 06:30.052
And all these elements outside of the text, they're as much a part of the artifact as the text itself.

06:30.092 --> 06:31.534
I'm telling you fans about it.

06:31.818 --> 06:33.300
Yeah.

06:33.320 --> 06:35.523
But I think that's a very recent point of view.

06:35.543 --> 06:36.584
Oh, it is.

06:36.604 --> 06:39.848
I think that word just comes in within the last 10 years.

06:39.868 --> 06:58.031
Remember when libraries used to bind journals, and particularly early periodicals from the 19th century, they took out all the advertising matter because they thought that all that was important was the actual articles and the illustrations.

06:58.051 --> 06:59.513
So they did that to

06:59.864 --> 07:02.488
some journals, now we would shoot ourselves.

07:02.848 --> 07:03.769
I mean, we'd never do that.

07:04.671 --> 07:06.413
Because you want to know all those things.

07:06.433 --> 07:10.038
And so I think that people are just interested in different things.

07:10.579 --> 07:23.778
And also cultural historians have really pushed that, because they think all kinds of things are important now.

07:24.338 --> 07:24.559
Yeah.

07:25.680 --> 07:27.002
They used to throw away the covers.

07:27.910 --> 07:28.831
Well, L.C.

07:28.871 --> 07:30.613
still doesn't keep the covers.

07:30.773 --> 07:32.875
To this day, Library of Congress still chucks the covers.

07:33.476 --> 07:34.096
To this day.

07:34.537 --> 07:35.538
To this day, yeah.

07:35.558 --> 07:38.200
I mean, as far as six months ago, they don't.

07:38.220 --> 07:41.163
They just can't fool around with it.

07:41.424 --> 07:44.767
And they acknowledge it, and they say it's a mistake, and maybe it will change.

07:45.127 --> 07:50.913
And you know, in some books, you get some books by Sendak, but I noticed you got a Sendak piece of art up there.

07:50.933 --> 07:57.580
You know, there are Sendak books that have different pieces of art, different things in the dust jacket.

07:58.505 --> 08:01.369
are not in the book, and yet they will be throwing these things away.

08:02.630 --> 08:04.612
It's crazy.

08:04.633 --> 08:06.515
You've been very generous with your time.

08:06.595 --> 08:08.417
I'm not even paying attention to the time.

08:08.457 --> 08:11.000
Well, it's so much fun to talk about.

08:11.020 --> 08:16.307
And we didn't even talk about that next book, the book, actually, what most of us do.

08:16.327 --> 08:27.060
The formatting is starting when we buy audio archives or videos or things 20th century artistic performances or

08:27.513 --> 08:36.483
documents when people were noticing that a lot of gallery owners or other art historians made tapes with artists now.

08:37.044 --> 08:40.128
They are so high maintenance.

08:40.148 --> 08:47.096
We get them, and then we have to reformat them, and we have to make archival copies and use copies and masters.

08:47.716 --> 08:51.681
We buy a book, maybe we have to make a box for it.

08:52.015 --> 08:54.959
Maybe we have to clean it a little.

08:54.979 --> 08:59.665
I mean, we buy things in such good condition that we don't even have to do that.

09:00.246 --> 09:03.049
They are so low-maintenance.

09:03.069 --> 09:04.231
It is so interesting.

09:04.591 --> 09:09.938
The books... Yeah, this isn't true at all.

09:11.019 --> 09:16.947
And it's so interesting because the other thing is with digital formats, you don't even know how long that's going to last.

09:16.967 --> 09:19.390
We have no idea how long they're going to last.

09:20.146 --> 09:27.357
some of these things that we buy, because they're important and interesting, they're excruciatingly high-maintenance.

09:27.377 --> 09:29.660
And we don't even know that we've even captured it.

09:29.680 --> 09:35.408
And somebody has to—one of the examples I use is the Viking data, you know, from the 60s.

09:35.949 --> 09:45.884
Thirty percent of that stuff is useless now, because they stored it on magnetic tapes, and the things that have decayed are certain kinds of cards that they can't access anymore.

09:46.104 --> 09:47.466
Oh, there was a big scandal about it.

09:47.486 --> 09:48.988
We spent millions and millions of dollars

09:49.424 --> 09:53.428
And, of course, all of it wasn't looked at.

09:53.488 --> 10:01.036
I mean, they brought back just all kinds of material that was supposed to keep the astronomers busy for, you know, thirty years.

10:01.637 --> 10:04.460
And they go to this stuff now and they can't get it.

10:04.940 --> 10:05.961
Thanks a lot, you know.

10:06.522 --> 10:16.933
My favorite fact that I'm always kind of dragging, everyone's probably really sick of this thing that I drag out all the time at, you know, conferences and meetings that we have, but the most stable books.

10:17.352 --> 10:20.275
are the ones from the 18th century.

10:20.696 --> 10:22.057
They're fine.

10:23.579 --> 10:24.280
It's beautiful.

10:24.420 --> 10:25.561
It's lovely.

10:25.581 --> 10:27.123
About 1860s.

10:28.385 --> 10:33.470
The big problems are the modern books and then the objects.

10:33.530 --> 10:34.832
They're so difficult.

10:34.972 --> 10:38.576
And so it's very interesting that we haven't learned a thing.

10:39.317 --> 10:42.421
You know William Blades' The Enemies of Books?

10:42.541 --> 10:43.422
That's a famous book.

10:43.442 --> 10:44.623
I have a quote from that.

10:44.803 --> 10:47.106
I call that a real life book.

10:47.474 --> 10:48.616
And of course, he was crazy.

10:48.636 --> 10:54.807
He actually got himself a bookworm, you know, and somebody had sent him a live bookworm.

10:55.388 --> 11:01.939
And so he put it out in a little box, and he tried to, I used it, like, oh, she gave it, it wouldn't touch the,

11:02.577 --> 11:06.886
It would go near the contemporary books because of the acids and stuff.

11:07.727 --> 11:10.994
He put a little bit of Jensen in there, a little bit of Caxton in there, whatever.

11:11.515 --> 11:12.417
He says, they love that.

11:12.477 --> 11:13.118
They love this stuff.

11:13.238 --> 11:13.879
It's like a banquet.

11:13.899 --> 11:14.781
They love this stuff.

11:14.801 --> 11:15.823
He says, they won't go near.

11:16.224 --> 11:17.607
He's writing in the 1860s.

11:17.747 --> 11:20.232
It's a fabulous quote.

11:20.650 --> 11:26.796
And then he said the bookworm finally dies, you know, and it's hysterical, you know.

11:26.816 --> 11:27.697
This is good.

11:27.717 --> 11:35.786
One of the things that I really believe is that books have these lives, and Lamanhap wrote this book called The Life of the Book, and I believe that books have these— The Life of the Book?

11:35.806 --> 11:39.569
Yeah, it's a book for children, and it's about— Lamanhap wrote this?

11:39.590 --> 11:40.831
Yeah, it's a very nice— The Life of the Book.

11:40.951 --> 11:45.576
Yeah, I bet you can get it, you know— Well, ABE books, I'll probably find it in the theater.

11:45.656 --> 11:49.780
I have it at home, unfortunately, it's not here, but it's this nice book for children

11:50.097 --> 11:52.300
on why books are important.

11:53.042 --> 12:04.379
It's very sweet, and I really believe that books have lives, and they live much longer than we do, and they go from place to place, and they convey knowledge.

12:04.420 --> 12:06.383
That's the theme of my trilogy.

12:06.403 --> 12:07.004
Come on now.

12:07.044 --> 12:12.392
That's a big belief of mine, and so it's nice to participate in that.

12:12.710 --> 12:15.113
to see that you're part of it, but you're going to die.

12:15.513 --> 12:16.975
But these books are just going to go on and on.

12:16.995 --> 12:22.000
And we have to think, quote, men may come and men may go, but books go on forever.

12:22.040 --> 12:26.145
The surest and swiftest way to immortality is the creation of a great library.

12:26.505 --> 12:32.752
That comes as close to explaining why he was so emboldened to create the Huntington Library.

12:32.792 --> 12:41.281
He saw his immortality through the books, which would long survive him forever.

12:42.062 --> 12:42.683
That's great.

12:43.203 --> 12:43.864
It's been very good.

12:44.485 --> 12:55.503
And of course we also write in this new book, we went to San Lazaro Island in Venice, where the Armenians have preserved their culture since 1720.

12:55.523 --> 13:00.390
I'm very interested in exile libraries, expatriate libraries.

13:00.430 --> 13:04.877
I write about the destruction of the library in Sarajevo in 1992.

13:05.038 --> 13:07.742
One night, 1.2 million books destroyed.

13:08.583 --> 13:10.926
in an attempt at the ethnic cleansing.

13:10.986 --> 13:13.388
If you're going to kill the people, you really have to destroy their books.

13:13.408 --> 13:14.529
Yeah, you get their cultural heritage, yeah.

13:14.549 --> 13:15.390
You have to get the books.

13:16.351 --> 13:25.601
And then the attempt by Harvard and elsewhere to replicate or to reseed, if it's possible, but to try and use whatever means they can.

13:26.562 --> 13:31.067
And then there's a guy, he's up at Harvard now, he's a librarian, Gene Smith.

13:31.267 --> 13:33.109
He's not at Harvard, but he's based in Cambridge.

13:33.430 --> 13:36.213
Remember, I introduced you to him in New York.

13:36.233 --> 13:38.235
He's been gathering up all the Tibetan books.

13:38.755 --> 13:42.960
And he has more Tibetan books than there are in Tibet, you know.

13:43.060 --> 13:46.924
Books that have been taken out over the last 40, 50 years.

13:46.944 --> 13:47.885
That kind of stuff.

13:47.905 --> 13:58.497
I'm interested in the books of threatened cultures and attempts to create exile libraries, expatriate libraries.

13:58.517 --> 14:04.704
The Polish library, Martin Gregorian told me, he said, when you're in Paris, go to the Polish library in Il San Luis.

14:04.744 --> 14:07.547
It was in Il San Luis in the city, the one right behind me.

14:08.118 --> 14:08.839
The Notre Dame.

14:08.859 --> 14:09.981
The Notre Dame, yeah.

14:10.001 --> 14:11.423
You know, that's when there was no Poland.

14:11.483 --> 14:23.822
For 150 years when there was no Poland, when it was broken up, a group of Polish intellectuals went to Paris and created what was, in essence, the National Library of Poland in Paris.

14:24.423 --> 14:25.084
Yeah, yeah.

14:25.104 --> 14:25.825
And it's fabulous.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.168
So that kind of stuff is what we're doing.

14:28.228 --> 14:29.090
It's very sad.

14:29.530 --> 14:37.382
Some of the scholars who come here from East Germany and from the other countries, you know, just lost everything in World War II.

14:37.885 --> 14:43.835
And we have all the books that they used to have and use, and sometimes— Here at the Getty?

14:44.736 --> 14:46.119
Or you mean here in the U.S.?

14:46.139 --> 14:46.239
Here.

14:46.259 --> 14:47.261
Here at the Getty.

14:47.281 --> 14:47.742
Really?

14:47.842 --> 14:50.646
Yeah, and so in some cases— What kinds of books?

14:50.666 --> 14:50.967
Artists?

14:51.287 --> 14:51.808
Art history.

14:51.989 --> 14:53.972
Yeah, just the artists' monographs and histories.

14:54.313 --> 14:58.780
But they're all, you know, books that were in their libraries, but they don't have anymore.

14:59.063 --> 15:04.870
There was a program a couple of years ago we sort of refurbished with some of our duplicates from the large collections.

15:04.890 --> 15:07.072
I'd like to know about that.

15:07.092 --> 15:08.053
Can I email you on that?

15:08.073 --> 15:10.096
Yeah, let me get the facts on it.

15:11.357 --> 15:12.058
We sent books.

15:12.158 --> 15:15.142
We sent huge loads of books to the Eastern European countries.

15:15.162 --> 15:17.765
That would be of immense interest to us.

15:18.365 --> 15:20.328
That absolutely fits into the thing.

15:20.348 --> 15:24.413
I'm sure it's in one of our old annual reports, but I'll find it and send it to you.

15:25.894 --> 15:28.277
Actually, if you want, I can send you

15:28.797 --> 15:35.029
I might need to make a copy of the collector's book, and if you want the world from here sent to you so you don't have to carry it back.

15:35.049 --> 15:35.670
I carry that.

15:35.931 --> 15:36.211
Really?

15:36.372 --> 15:37.995
Okay.

15:38.536 --> 15:42.423
It's really wonderful because I love these books that have devices of wonder.

15:42.764 --> 15:48.676
They have little vignettes, and so they have little stories about groupings or the books, and that's what they did.

15:49.137 --> 15:50.940
We got that idea, of course, from the

15:51.308 --> 15:51.829
Oh, shoot.

15:51.849 --> 15:54.051
What was the Philadelphia show, Legacies of Genius?

15:54.151 --> 15:56.834
That was the whole thing that started Gentle Madness.

15:56.914 --> 16:01.659
There wouldn't be a Gentle Madness if Marie Curie and Eddie Wolfe didn't do that show.

16:01.679 --> 16:03.781
The Legacies of Genius, yeah.

16:03.801 --> 16:04.842
That's kind of what this L.A.

16:04.862 --> 16:05.483
show is like.

16:06.564 --> 16:09.807
What's your email address?

16:09.827 --> 16:10.728
Oh, it's M. Reed.

16:10.808 --> 16:11.569
It's on my card.

16:11.669 --> 16:12.170
Oh, it's on my card.

16:12.190 --> 16:12.710
So you've got it.

16:12.770 --> 16:13.191
Okay, good.

16:13.571 --> 16:15.573
So that's easy, but it's intuitive.

16:15.593 --> 16:18.516
It's just mreed at getty.edu, but it's there.

16:19.417 --> 16:20.498
Books to Eastern Europe.

16:20.979 --> 16:21.079
Okay.

16:21.464 --> 16:22.647
Let me dig out some things.

16:22.667 --> 16:26.015
I'm sorry, you could probably tell I could talk forever about this stuff.

16:26.256 --> 16:28.461
I'm sorry.

16:28.561 --> 16:31.990
You haven't seen us running for the tour, have you?

16:32.010 --> 16:36.300
Just changing tapes.
