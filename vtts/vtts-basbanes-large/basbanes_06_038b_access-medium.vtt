00:03.997 --> 00:05.078
A boy from a farm in Illinois.

00:05.158 --> 00:05.759
Edward Ayer.

00:06.140 --> 00:07.381
Edward Ayer, A-Y-E-R.

00:07.481 --> 00:08.282
Edward or Edwin?

00:08.543 --> 00:08.903
Edward.

00:08.963 --> 00:10.145
Edward E. Ayer.

00:10.846 --> 00:12.948
And he was a big collector, major collector?

00:12.968 --> 00:16.373
Big Chicago collector of not just books, but all kinds of things.

00:16.933 --> 00:28.088
In fact, I was astounded to see, when I was at Ithaca a couple months ago, I see on the shelf in their History of Science collection, big fat cattle, the Edward E. Ayer collection.

00:28.749 --> 00:31.472
I pull it off the shelf and it's ornithology.

00:31.756 --> 00:33.839
books at the Field Museum.

00:34.179 --> 00:34.880
Published catalog.

00:35.281 --> 00:37.223
I mean, he collected Egyptian antiquities.

00:37.263 --> 00:40.127
If you go down to the Field Museum, lots of things in there.

00:40.167 --> 00:42.711
Egyptology collection, gift of every year.

00:42.731 --> 00:49.560
Well, he's also the man who convinced Marshall Field to give the original endowment for creating the Field Museum.

00:49.680 --> 00:59.113
The Field Museum's collection has its basis in the World's Fair of 93, and that material was collected for the anthropological exhibits, the ethnographic exhibits, or some of it was.

00:59.903 --> 01:07.312
And then a group of businessmen, led by Ayer, decided it shouldn't leave the city, but it should be the core of a new collection.

01:07.532 --> 01:13.800
But they couldn't find a grandfather, so they went to Marshall Field, and Field agreed to do it.

01:14.001 --> 01:17.365
But Ayer had to agree to be the first president of the board.

01:17.385 --> 01:19.628
You said there's something written about Ayer?

01:19.648 --> 01:23.292
Yeah, it was done by a relative, actually.

01:23.312 --> 01:25.675
Is it a published biography, or is it a...

01:25.992 --> 01:27.734
Some family type thing.

01:27.794 --> 01:31.039
Is it something I'm likely to find at the Widener Library?

01:32.140 --> 01:37.927
Frank Lockridge is the author.

01:40.090 --> 01:43.134
He was a substantial enough guy then to have a biography.

01:43.254 --> 01:45.477
Oh yeah, he was an interesting guy.

01:45.938 --> 01:47.680
In a way he was very much in the

01:48.014 --> 01:50.321
Very much like Huntington, I think, in a lot of ways.

01:50.341 --> 01:51.885
I don't know what Huntington's boyhood was like.

01:51.905 --> 01:54.152
He may have been born with a silver spoon, but Ayer was not.

01:54.553 --> 01:56.398
But they both made a lot of money in railroads.

01:56.439 --> 01:57.863
Ayer was selling railroad ties.

01:59.748 --> 02:01.433
Huntington was making railroads.

02:01.453 --> 02:02.817
Huntington was making railroads, right.

02:03.202 --> 02:07.347
But I think in later years they were very thick.

02:07.567 --> 02:12.032
Ayer and Ayer would go out to California and would visit them and stay with them.

02:12.052 --> 02:14.294
Well, I'm going back to Huntington and I've got access.

02:14.614 --> 02:16.917
They're giving me access to the correspondence.

02:17.097 --> 02:19.019
Maybe there's a nice Huntington-Ayer correspondence.

02:19.039 --> 02:23.124
It would be nice to know if there was one because there you'd have two collectors talking to each other.

02:23.144 --> 02:27.148
That's a different discourse than when you have a librarian interested in it.

02:27.168 --> 02:30.392
Huntington-Ayer correspondence at Huntington.

02:30.692 --> 02:31.673
Write that down in that.

02:34.100 --> 02:43.272
But the story of Ayer getting to briefly, he was, as a young man, he was in San Francisco when the Civil War broke up.

02:43.393 --> 02:50.462
So he joined some California regiment and was sent down to southern Arizona to guard a silver mine way down near the Mexican border.

02:50.963 --> 02:53.186
And he's sitting there, and this kid is off the farm.

02:53.246 --> 02:55.108
He hasn't read a book, you know, ever, maybe.

02:55.849 --> 02:57.391
And there's nothing to do.

02:57.451 --> 03:02.318
And he sees in the mine manager's office there's Prescott's Conquest of Mexico.

03:02.703 --> 03:06.348
So he starts reading and he's spellbound, you know, this is incredible.

03:06.429 --> 03:08.391
And it's like, this is what I want to do with my life.

03:08.472 --> 03:10.294
I want to learn about American history.

03:10.695 --> 03:15.462
So that's the air, that's the keystone of the air collection.

03:15.682 --> 03:17.245
That's the myth about it anyway.

03:17.285 --> 03:19.949
Well, yeah, and he wrote the myth.

03:19.969 --> 03:21.531
I mean, it's all history.

03:21.651 --> 03:22.973
This is the home of...

03:23.206 --> 03:24.929
advertising and public relations.

03:25.129 --> 03:29.817
He came back from the Civil War in 1866 or 17.

03:29.857 --> 03:39.333
He's bringing a load of hay or wood or something downtown, and he goes into the bookstore here in Chicago and says, do you have Prescott's Conquest of Mexico?

03:39.353 --> 03:40.155
And they say, yes, we do.

03:40.175 --> 03:43.641
We have the new Scribner's editions in three volumes, and they bring it out.

03:43.661 --> 03:44.302
He said, how much is it?

03:44.322 --> 03:45.604
And they said, $15.

03:45.804 --> 03:47.567
I said, $15.

03:48.128 --> 03:49.230
Well, he said, could I

03:49.970 --> 03:52.734
could I maybe, would you save it for me and I'll pay you when I can or something.

03:52.754 --> 03:55.958
He's like, you take it along and bring us, you know, $3 a month or something.

03:55.998 --> 03:57.139
I don't know, it's over the, you know.

03:57.159 --> 03:58.521
So he buys it and it's down here.

03:58.561 --> 03:59.222
Maybe I can find it.

03:59.302 --> 04:02.947
And he's got a note in it and he says he had taken it in the 90s.

04:02.967 --> 04:05.450
He took it to London to be bound by Zansdorf or something.

04:06.151 --> 04:11.918
And his instructions were, Mr. Zansdorf, this is, I consider this one of the most valuable books in my collection.

04:11.938 --> 04:14.762
I want you to treat it as a version.

04:15.299 --> 04:17.821
I gotta run this, what am I, about a five minute walk to Sam's?

04:17.841 --> 04:19.423
It's more like 10, but you better go.

04:20.864 --> 04:21.324
Okay.

04:22.205 --> 04:24.487
And what's a good question for Sam?

04:24.507 --> 04:26.268
Well, ask him to see his Marderstein books.

04:26.288 --> 04:26.849
How do you spell?

04:27.029 --> 04:30.492
M-A-R-D-E-R-S-T-E-I-G.

04:31.473 --> 04:31.773
Okay.

04:31.933 --> 04:37.358
And the other thing that he collects extensively is bindings, both modern and older bindings.

04:37.378 --> 04:37.618
Okay.

04:37.758 --> 04:44.344
I better write him because I... Same time as the three volumes of Mexico was bought, which now are the...

04:46.687 --> 04:51.319
Romance of my great American library in the Newbury Library.

04:51.920 --> 04:52.161
Here.

04:53.204 --> 04:54.648
Smell it, huh?

04:54.668 --> 04:56.633
Ah, that smells good.

04:56.733 --> 04:58.738
It's the other one that has been off, but...
