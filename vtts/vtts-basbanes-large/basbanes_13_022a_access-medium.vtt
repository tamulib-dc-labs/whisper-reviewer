00:02.883 --> 00:05.626
I'm in the National Yiddish Book Center.

00:06.847 --> 00:11.172
The fourth floor annex, as they call it.

00:11.773 --> 00:13.394
It's really an old factory.

00:14.916 --> 00:21.143
There are dozens of groves of hills.

00:21.243 --> 00:31.333
And interestingly enough, the numbers are Arabic, but the designations are Yiddish.

00:31.354 --> 00:32.755
They have a Yiddish...

00:33.477 --> 00:37.263
Linotype machine, probably the only operating one in the United States.

00:38.464 --> 00:40.207
This is a huge hole.

00:40.227 --> 00:44.614
I would say several hundred feet in length.

00:45.395 --> 00:49.080
I might just count the numbers of rows of shelves here.

00:49.741 --> 00:55.630
And there are perhaps half a dozen kids here who are summer interns completing their internships this week.

00:57.012 --> 00:57.633
Neil.

00:57.653 --> 01:01.138
We're talking to Neil Zagorin, Z-A-T-O-R-I-N.

01:01.658 --> 01:04.862
And you are the bibliographer for the... Are you Yiddish?

01:04.882 --> 01:05.462
Yes, I am.

01:05.502 --> 01:06.564
And I've been here four years.

01:07.445 --> 01:09.827
Can you just give me a bit of your background?

01:09.847 --> 01:11.629
Are you a trained bibliographer?

01:11.749 --> 01:14.512
I was an anthropology major when I was in school.

01:14.693 --> 01:15.253
And where was I?

01:15.494 --> 01:16.795
At the University of Massachusetts.

01:16.955 --> 01:17.155
Okay.

01:17.216 --> 01:18.197
Are you from around here?

01:18.217 --> 01:21.901
I grew up in Springfield, just to the south of here.

01:22.181 --> 01:27.447
The 18,000 square feet on this floor hallows approximately half a million Yiddish books.

01:27.983 --> 01:32.569
which have been sorted out and put on the shelves alphabetically by the author's last name.

01:32.609 --> 01:35.252
The book center has collected over a million pieces.

01:35.373 --> 01:40.739
That includes journals, newspapers, magazines, as well as books.

01:41.460 --> 01:48.710
We get books in all kinds of languages because the people who read these Yiddish books were often bi or tri or quadrilingual.

01:50.051 --> 01:54.377
So we have books in Hebrew and English and Russian and Polish and French and German as well.

01:54.397 --> 01:55.999
But what we're trying to do is

01:56.198 --> 01:57.019
collect the books.

01:57.039 --> 01:58.101
You have shelf marks.

01:58.181 --> 02:01.286
You have a computer that tells you where a title is.

02:01.366 --> 02:04.151
Can you put your hands on something if somebody asks you for it?

02:04.171 --> 02:10.862
Yes, we can, because the collection is organized alphabetically according to the author's last name.

02:10.882 --> 02:22.982
We have college students who work here in the summer opening up boxes of books and sorting them out, and they don't know enough theaters to be able to say this is a novel or this is a book of memoirs, so we just do it alphabetically by the author's last name.

02:23.722 --> 02:28.767
We have a computerized database with 7,500 titles in it now.

02:30.728 --> 02:35.172
We guess, when people ask us to guess, that we have somewhere between 15,000 and 20,000 titles.

02:36.634 --> 02:43.139
Out of the total of somewhere approaching 50,000 titles in modern... Which is the figure that Aaron says.

02:43.580 --> 02:49.225
When I first spoke with him, it was 40,000, but now it's... He rises up with the 50,000.

02:49.245 --> 02:52.868
Zachary Baker, the librarian of Evo Ambitu, has no calling in there.

02:53.168 --> 02:56.273
is the one who upped the estimate.

02:59.537 --> 03:13.638
There are any number of libraries which have more extensive collections of Jewish literature than we do, but this is the only place that has, this is the only place that it can supply books in multiple conferences.

03:13.798 --> 03:15.801
But who has a more extensive collection?

03:19.146 --> 03:22.551
Evo, probably Library of Congress, Oxford,

03:23.240 --> 03:27.426
However, Yale will be in the process of building it up.

03:27.446 --> 03:30.089
Jewish Theological Seminary, Columbia University.

03:30.470 --> 03:31.972
That's what you want.

03:32.012 --> 03:32.652
That's the idea.

03:32.733 --> 03:33.634
That is the idea.

03:33.654 --> 03:34.175
That's the goal.

03:34.375 --> 03:35.156
That's the idea.

03:35.256 --> 03:37.118
This is not a collecting competition.

03:37.158 --> 03:38.380
This is not an archive.

03:38.400 --> 03:39.381
This is not an archive.

03:39.401 --> 03:40.243
We're a clearinghouse.

03:40.303 --> 03:43.968
We'd be happy if we could put ourselves out of business by sending all the books out.

03:43.988 --> 03:46.451
We recognize that that's not going to happen for a very long time.

03:46.471 --> 03:52.639
We sent 10,000 books out of here last year, which is phenomenal, considering that

03:52.838 --> 03:56.964
10, 15 years ago, there was very little interest at all in Yiddish literature.

03:57.025 --> 04:00.430
But we still get $500,000 a week in the mail.

04:00.810 --> 04:01.752
How do you price them?

04:01.772 --> 04:08.563
96, 97, 98% of the books are priced between $8 and $12.

04:08.663 --> 04:12.749
So basically it's a handling fee.

04:12.769 --> 04:14.712
Yeah.

04:15.574 --> 04:17.356
You're covering your costs, in other words.

04:17.397 --> 04:19.159
We're not even covering the cost from the book sales.

04:19.580 --> 04:20.922
If we...

04:21.627 --> 04:49.086
the properties of our book sales bring in about 10 12 percent of the book sales operating budget you can ask aaron for the exact figure the point is you're not selling for intrinsic value per se you know putting 500 on the price of a book we can only one of 10 of such you know or 20 known copies yeah uh you follow what i'm saying yes yes i do most books we sell

04:49.606 --> 04:52.569
what we consider to be a nominal charge, $8, $10, $12.

04:52.850 --> 04:55.232
And I notice the condition is not really relevant.

04:56.433 --> 04:58.716
You're not about to reject the book if it comes in.

04:59.177 --> 05:01.199
No, we save them all.

05:01.419 --> 05:04.963
You never know when it will be the last copy and somebody might want it.

05:04.983 --> 05:06.645
We don't really do any conservation work.

05:06.665 --> 05:11.550
If a book comes in that's mildew, we try to dry it and wrap it in plastic, and that's really what we can do.

05:12.351 --> 05:13.392
You don't throw anything away.

05:13.432 --> 05:16.035
No.

05:16.387 --> 05:20.974
Do you have an attitude of how you treat these things that come in, these books?

05:20.994 --> 05:29.066
Well, I read these books represent a large part of the cultural heritage of the Jew, Ashkenazi Jews in Europe.

05:31.029 --> 05:35.616
So each book that is here is a part of that heritage, regardless of the condition.

05:35.717 --> 05:39.142
Yeah, that's potentially priceless, I mean, in a sense.

05:39.442 --> 05:41.085
So show me around a little bit.

05:41.105 --> 05:45.111
I mean, you can see by looking at the shows that some books we have hundreds of copies of.

05:45.513 --> 05:48.178
What is this book, for instance?

05:48.198 --> 05:49.901
This book is called 1905.

05:49.921 --> 05:51.343
It's from Moshe Alden.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.407
Write it down for me.

05:54.709 --> 05:58.035
You better actually print it, so I like this.

05:58.696 --> 06:00.580
It's a blue octavo, I would say.

06:00.620 --> 06:02.423
The title is 1905.

06:02.483 --> 06:03.725
Is that right?

06:03.745 --> 06:03.886
Mm-hmm.

06:04.607 --> 06:05.769
1905.

06:06.871 --> 06:09.175
It's a royal blue color.

06:09.847 --> 06:12.772
I would estimate 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

06:12.792 --> 06:15.156
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 is 60.

06:15.176 --> 06:20.885
120, you have several hundred, perhaps 300 copies of this book.

06:20.905 --> 06:23.830
9th and 10th would be the title of the edition.

06:24.752 --> 06:27.596
Y-U-T-S-U-V-U, and what's that last word there?

06:28.598 --> 06:29.259
How do you spell that?

06:29.500 --> 06:29.940
F-I-N-F.

06:30.201 --> 06:35.770
F-I-N-F, okay.

06:36.678 --> 06:39.401
I suppose you could call him the Dean of the Yiddish Communist.

06:40.022 --> 06:40.122
Okay.

06:40.563 --> 06:47.131
He was the editor of the Jewish Communist newspaper, the Freiheit, and he wrote a lot.

06:47.491 --> 06:52.918
And there was a period in the 20s and 30s when a lot of people bought his books.

06:53.218 --> 06:56.482
This was probably... Printed in the USA.

06:56.743 --> 06:59.065
Most of the books that we have here were printed in the United States.

06:59.726 --> 07:02.770
How do you account for so many copies of this?

07:05.450 --> 07:14.701
I'm not sure how many Jews were living in the United States in the 30s and 40s, but there might have been a couple of million of them who were literate in Yiddish and they read.

07:15.021 --> 07:17.924
They read and they bought books to support the authors and they hung on to them.

07:19.426 --> 07:24.992
I mean, this particular title, there seems to be quite a large, maybe it was printed.

07:25.072 --> 07:32.441
He was a personality among a certain Yiddish community, so when he published a book, people would have bought it.

07:33.142 --> 07:34.343
Let's move along a little bit.

07:37.985 --> 07:41.490
Here's the poet Chaim Nachman Bialik.

07:42.191 --> 07:43.773
We also have lots and lots of his books.

07:44.034 --> 07:47.198
Can we get his name here again?

07:47.218 --> 07:47.899
You can write it down.

07:48.400 --> 07:50.002
That's a nice one.

07:50.022 --> 07:52.105
Copyright.

07:55.410 --> 07:57.613
And he starts from the back and goes forward, right?

07:58.254 --> 08:00.737
He was known, yes.

08:00.897 --> 08:02.600
It opens from the right.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.405
He's known mostly for his Hebrew poetry, but he also

08:06.672 --> 08:10.156
wrote a little bit in Yiddish, and quite a bit of his poetry was translated.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.319
This is a lovely condition, this book.

08:13.280 --> 08:14.182
Quite a few of them are.

08:14.282 --> 08:16.104
A lot of them were... It's a book plate.

08:16.124 --> 08:19.508
It is a book plate.

08:19.528 --> 08:19.929
Can you read it?

08:20.490 --> 08:29.121
Book collection of somebody, Elkin.

08:30.322 --> 08:30.883
That's nice.

08:33.967 --> 08:35.008
This book was actually...

08:37.452 --> 08:38.373
It's Mendel Elkin.

08:39.254 --> 08:40.556
It's very interesting that we open this one.

08:40.616 --> 08:41.938
Mendel Elkin was a Yiddish writer.

08:42.539 --> 08:45.302
It says, Mendel Elkin and mit freindschaft, Yudit Schwarz.

08:45.803 --> 08:48.066
To Mendel Elkin with friendship, Yudit Schwarz.

08:48.606 --> 08:49.047
You know what?

08:49.087 --> 08:51.090
This might be an inscribed copy from the author.

08:51.190 --> 08:55.616
Not the author, but from the poet who translated Bialik's poetry from Hebrew to Yiddish.

08:55.636 --> 08:55.736
Okay.

08:55.756 --> 08:58.099
Spelled Bialik's name, B-I-A-L-I-K, right?

08:58.119 --> 08:58.880
Yeah.

08:58.900 --> 09:01.744
And the Library of Congress has an authority.

09:01.964 --> 09:05.609
And this particular copy we picked up is inscribed by the translator to whom?

09:06.169 --> 09:06.750
To...

09:07.203 --> 09:11.027
Mendel Elkin, who was also a Yiddish writer.

09:11.047 --> 09:12.929
It's very interesting that we have to pull us off the shelf.

09:13.890 --> 09:15.052
I'll take this and talk.

09:15.132 --> 09:19.256
I was just going to say that... Put this one aside.

09:19.637 --> 09:19.897
See that?

09:20.017 --> 09:21.178
I'm glad I came.

09:21.358 --> 09:22.540
Yeah.

09:22.620 --> 09:25.843
That's what's known as an association copy.

09:26.624 --> 09:29.207
The jargon is that's an association copy.

09:29.227 --> 09:30.588
Okay.

09:30.608 --> 09:33.732
The jargon of... You read my book, as I hope you will.

09:33.752 --> 09:33.852
Okay.

09:34.085 --> 09:35.186
You'll learn some of this stuff.

09:35.206 --> 09:37.028
Who's the picture of this gentleman here?

09:37.048 --> 09:37.909
Chaim Zhitlovsky.

09:38.029 --> 09:51.063
He was another illicit intellectual who shifted among various ideological viewpoints over the course of his life, whose thoughts were quite influential at one point.

09:51.103 --> 09:57.190
Dr. Chaim, C-H-A-I-M-Z-H-I-T-L-O-V-S-K-Y.

09:57.507 --> 09:59.790
His years are 1865 to 1940.

10:00.271 --> 10:03.896
The Library of Congress may have a different version of how his name is.

10:04.036 --> 10:06.220
Is this picture here because his books are here?

10:06.941 --> 10:09.564
Are we down on the Yiddish version of the Zs?

10:09.664 --> 10:11.066
Yes.

10:11.087 --> 10:12.428
And are these the letters here?

10:19.499 --> 10:19.639
Mm-hmm.

10:19.659 --> 10:22.483
How can we have duplication of numbers for rows?

10:24.245 --> 10:27.430
You have certainly more than 14 rows of books.

10:28.422 --> 10:35.912
It's numbered by quadrants and then by row numbers in the quadrants.

10:35.932 --> 10:36.092
Okay.

10:36.112 --> 10:37.894
We don't need to use those numbers.

10:38.134 --> 10:42.019
Jeffrey and I, who have worked here for four years, know where things are in the show.

10:42.039 --> 10:43.601
He was Mendel Moiches.

10:43.621 --> 10:44.823
Mendel Moiches.

10:47.607 --> 10:49.349
M-O-I-C-H-E-R-S.

10:49.369 --> 10:54.415
His surname is S-F-O-R-I-M, 1836-1917.

10:55.036 --> 10:55.797
He was...

10:56.148 --> 10:59.631
He's considered to be the first of the great modern English writers.

10:59.651 --> 11:01.113
Why are these pictures here once again?

11:01.613 --> 11:05.657
Oh, we found them in books or something like that, and we put them up.

11:05.677 --> 11:07.919
Just make it interesting for people.

11:07.939 --> 11:10.521
Just make it interesting for people.

11:10.581 --> 11:12.043
Take your picture.

11:13.424 --> 11:17.067
This picture is actually in the right place.

11:17.087 --> 11:18.809
It would need to be moved.

11:18.889 --> 11:21.351
How about this picture?

11:21.371 --> 11:23.954
Is this in the right place?

11:23.974 --> 11:24.214
No.

11:31.973 --> 11:44.891
That's what I want to get the picture to.

11:44.911 --> 11:45.552
Move a little bit to the left.

11:45.572 --> 11:46.834
Okay.

11:46.854 --> 11:52.161
Any rare books, per se, out here, or have they been removed from the general stacks?

11:52.622 --> 12:00.833
We keep books that we consider to be rare in the office, and what is a rare book by us is not necessarily something that is rare by a book collector.

12:01.319 --> 12:08.648
What we consider to be noteworthy are things which are seldom and of intrinsic... Well, scarcity.

12:08.868 --> 12:10.951
Scarcity and of intrinsic literary value.

12:11.371 --> 12:12.292
Can you show me some of these?

12:12.373 --> 12:12.633
Sure.

12:12.833 --> 12:13.254
Sure can.

12:15.657 --> 12:20.482
Yiddish books that are rare, according to our standards, are not necessarily monetarily valuable.

12:20.523 --> 12:20.863
No, no.

12:20.963 --> 12:23.186
Well, rare is not, and that's why I'm here.

12:23.226 --> 12:28.312
Rarity is scarcity, and then combined with significance.

12:28.372 --> 12:30.735
So that's, you know... And what we do...

12:31.711 --> 12:38.078
We put catalogs out three or four times a year of titles which have newly been added to our database.

12:39.359 --> 12:50.571
And the catalogs are sent to a range of major libraries and research institutions that do Judaic studies or specifically Yiddish, and they get first picked.

12:51.752 --> 12:59.240
So what we're trying to do is ensure that anything which is very significant or unusual is going to end up in the public domain that way.

12:59.680 --> 13:01.482
Do you think this is 300 feet long?

13:02.896 --> 13:03.857
A football field?

13:04.158 --> 13:06.521
It could be a football field, you know?

13:06.542 --> 13:10.107
I think it's reasonably close.

13:10.127 --> 13:11.429
Yeah, give or take.

13:12.871 --> 13:19.421
You could figure it out by measuring the space between the stanchions and this number of the stanchions.

13:21.544 --> 13:27.653
But I'd say it's close.

13:27.774 --> 13:28.375
It's close.

13:28.395 --> 13:30.658
It's a heck of a lot more than 100, that's for sure.

13:32.275 --> 13:34.557
which is the frontage of my house.

13:34.718 --> 13:38.902
Okay, I don't mean to rush.

13:38.922 --> 13:43.667
Just tell me, give me a fast run by the Glinotype machine.

13:43.687 --> 13:46.230
Well, several years ago, the Jewish Daily Forward in New York.

13:46.290 --> 13:47.171
The Jewish Daily?

13:47.371 --> 13:48.653
Jewish Daily Forward.

13:49.053 --> 13:50.194
Forward, F-O-R-W-A-R-D.

13:50.214 --> 13:58.443
Which at one time had a circulation of a quarter of a million, making it the largest non-English newspaper ever published in the United States.

14:00.605 --> 14:02.147
So the Forward...

14:02.954 --> 14:08.601
at the end of 1989, finally phased out its hot-length printing operation.

14:08.621 --> 14:13.167
They replaced the last nine Yiddish line-of-type machines with one PC.

14:14.288 --> 14:25.202
And the Workman Circle on the forward were kind enough to arrange to take one of the machines as well.

14:25.222 --> 14:26.824
Do you have a copy of that newspaper line?

14:28.206 --> 14:28.927
Of this article?

14:28.947 --> 14:30.008
Of this article?

14:31.439 --> 14:39.047
You, we have caught, there are a number of articles about this, and you should probably... I got one, they gave me one from the Wall Street Journal, but I'd love to get a copy of this.

14:39.227 --> 14:45.414
You should probably ask Aaron, because he's, Aaron would be... The Union News is, where is that published in New York?

14:45.474 --> 14:49.578
Oh, I could get that, then.

14:49.598 --> 14:50.379
I could call that.

14:50.399 --> 14:56.065
Maybe the Wall Street Journal won a spike down, right?

14:56.085 --> 14:56.225
Mm-hmm.

14:56.245 --> 14:56.345
Okay.

14:56.365 --> 14:56.586
Go ahead.

14:56.966 --> 14:59.689
It was quite interesting, if you get this article, you can read all about it.

14:59.709 --> 15:00.670
It was a white project.

15:01.190 --> 15:25.948
to bring it up here three trips to the truck to bring the parts up and then it took this expert mechanic half a week to put it back together and then it took us months to learn how to make it run but it does run now most of the time occasionally it gets jammed but we have we're very fortunate in that the small number of printers who use this technology are very much a

15:26.519 --> 15:30.863
a clan, and they love it that somebody has a Yiddish archetype.

15:30.883 --> 15:39.412
So we have any number of people who... You have to get the hot lead and heat up and melt these ingots.

15:40.714 --> 15:44.578
I wrote in a newspaper for 20 years, and before they went over, it's a cold type.

15:44.878 --> 15:49.042
It's that little well where the stuff is... The pot.

15:49.342 --> 15:50.864
The pot is what we call it.

15:50.884 --> 15:51.264
It works.

15:52.466 --> 15:53.106
That's wonderful.

15:53.367 --> 15:54.788
We had to learn how to do it ourselves.

15:55.578 --> 16:00.064
It was quite expensive to salvage this.

16:00.664 --> 16:04.169
And this was a project which came up very suddenly.

16:04.990 --> 16:13.140
So we had the idea that we would send a letter around to a core group of the book center's most avid supporters and ask people for donations.

16:13.220 --> 16:18.987
And with the stipulation, anybody who donated $50 or more would get their name set in a line of time.

16:19.388 --> 16:26.459
So we figured we'd get 50 or 100 people to donate money, and that would help subsidize a lot of the cost of bringing this back, and we had about 1,200.

16:26.519 --> 16:27.901
Isn't that wonderful?

16:28.322 --> 16:33.149
Well, it was wonderful in one sense, and on the other hand, it was terrible because we had to figure out how to print out 1,200 names.

16:33.269 --> 16:33.670
But you did.

16:34.591 --> 16:37.676
It took months, and we had to learn how to do it.

16:37.776 --> 16:38.657
They were patient, right?

16:39.138 --> 16:41.421
Yeah, they were patient.

16:41.442 --> 16:43.304
I don't think they did it from the line of type.

16:43.565 --> 16:45.127
No, they didn't.

16:45.768 --> 16:47.691
We had to learn how to do it ourselves through results.

16:48.295 --> 16:58.167
Chris Mourney, a printer in the area who has a small hot light operation of his own, came in quite often.

16:58.807 --> 17:00.750
Spent a couple of hours with us showing us how to use it.

17:00.810 --> 17:02.412
He eventually taught us.

17:02.812 --> 17:10.301
If people want to donate money to the book center, we'll put their name on it.

17:11.302 --> 17:14.826
Among Jewish people, it's a custom to celebrate

17:16.240 --> 17:21.865
a happy occasion by making a donation to a worthwhile college.

17:21.885 --> 17:23.847
This is how we recognize that.

17:23.887 --> 17:27.310
Nice.

17:27.330 --> 17:27.690
Okay.

17:28.191 --> 17:31.194
You're going to show me some rarities.

17:32.215 --> 17:34.537
And within the context that you've explained.

17:34.557 --> 17:34.657
Okay.

17:34.677 --> 17:38.580
Understanding the context that you've explained.

17:38.601 --> 17:40.322
Good.

17:40.342 --> 17:42.644
This facility, I gather, opened year-round.

17:42.965 --> 17:43.445
Yes, it is.

17:43.525 --> 17:45.707
But you're blessed by the presence of the

17:46.295 --> 17:48.017
of interns during the summer.

17:48.418 --> 17:50.981
During the summer.

17:53.484 --> 18:02.576
Among the many other things, among some of the many surprises that come away have been two collections of vintage music, which turned out to be publishers' remainders.

18:02.917 --> 18:03.297
Really?

18:03.317 --> 18:05.080
I can see they're in excellent condition.

18:05.340 --> 18:15.373
Well, these were published from the turn of the century to shortly after World War I by the Hebrew Publishing Company, which is a family-owned business, and they stopped

18:16.552 --> 18:21.379
They got out of the sheet music business shortly after World War I, and hung on to the rest of this music.

18:22.000 --> 18:27.789
And the family, the business moved from place to place, and they dragged the music around with them for years.

18:27.889 --> 18:40.288
And about 10 years ago, it was sold to somebody outside the family who finally decided to get rid of the music and be doing any of this first last year.

18:40.308 --> 18:45.816
So actually, interns from last summer and this summer

18:47.062 --> 19:14.048
spent time organizing the collection alphabetically and two of the interns that you met here today have written a computerized database have written a program for a computerized database and they've begun to catalog it okay so we're actually cornering the market on antique theater sheet music because over here we have a collection of sheet music which we acquired several years previously which is

19:14.703 --> 19:23.912
And this one, this one, this collection of sheet music has already been catalogued, so there's a copy.

19:23.932 --> 19:24.533
I can handle that, right?

19:24.553 --> 19:25.994
Yes, you can't copy the catalog.

19:26.715 --> 19:30.939
A man named Sidney Rimmer, who lives in Brooklyn, found all this music in a warehouse in Manhattan.

19:32.440 --> 19:44.592
Just left there and he thought it would be a shame to see it disappear, so he brought it home to Borough Park and moved his car out of the garage and moved the music in and put it in an air conditioner and hung onto it for over a decade, not knowing what would happen.

19:44.960 --> 19:47.143
I believe he lives in Borough Park in Brooklyn.

19:47.163 --> 19:47.684
Can you spell that?

19:47.724 --> 19:48.104
B-O-R?

19:49.807 --> 19:50.107
B-O-R.

19:50.147 --> 19:51.609
B-O-R-U-G-H.

19:52.050 --> 19:53.051
You can look it up in a map.

19:53.071 --> 19:53.592
I'm not sure.

19:53.792 --> 19:55.975
It's a neighborhood in Brooklyn.

19:57.116 --> 19:57.797
He hung on to it.

19:58.599 --> 19:59.299
What was his name?

19:59.620 --> 20:02.304
Sidney Rimmer.

20:02.324 --> 20:04.286
I believe R-I-M-M-E-R.

20:07.471 --> 20:10.995
He hung on to it for over a decade, thinking it would be a shame to see it lost.

20:11.015 --> 20:14.460
When he heard about the book's energy, he donated us the music and

20:14.575 --> 20:24.549
David and Lucille Guild and two generous Book Center supporters donated the money to catalog it.

20:24.569 --> 20:24.789
Great.

20:24.969 --> 20:25.770
Okay.

20:27.493 --> 20:30.717
We'll write along, as we say.

20:30.737 --> 20:31.498
This is our office.

20:31.518 --> 20:34.442
This is where we do all our book processing.

20:34.682 --> 20:41.832
That is, accessioning the books into our computerized database and also packing and sending out book orders.

20:42.740 --> 20:44.743
which we send all over the world.

20:45.384 --> 20:51.512
I mean, we have sent books to Guam and Thailand and places that you would not expect Yiddish books to go to.

20:51.532 --> 20:56.318
This is also where we keep the books which we would consider to be rare or unusual.

20:57.220 --> 21:05.831
So an example, well, some examples of that would be books autographed by the authors, such as the one we just found on the shelf several minutes ago.

21:06.853 --> 21:10.257
So this is basically, I'm going to take a picture of this.

21:10.277 --> 21:10.738
We would

21:12.203 --> 21:12.964
books in here.

21:24.740 --> 21:28.486
What other kinds of things would we consider unusual?

21:29.467 --> 21:36.557
Books published for unit language children's schools, which tended to have been heavily used and would fall apart.

21:36.577 --> 21:40.422
They were often, you know, these little, little, teeny tiny paperbacks.

21:40.655 --> 21:41.176
like this.

21:41.236 --> 21:42.979
We consider those to be unusual.

21:43.019 --> 21:44.180
We have those in the office.

21:52.353 --> 21:57.821
There are quite a number of Yiddish books about the Holocaust.

21:58.883 --> 22:06.294
Perhaps as much as 10% of our book collection are books that are about the Holocaust in one way or another.

22:07.336 --> 22:08.738
And some of those books are actually

22:08.870 --> 22:12.494
A lot of the books are memoirs, but some of the books are very unusual.

22:13.335 --> 22:32.078
There is a genre called , memorial books, which are like compilations about people who would come from these small towns in Europe, which were wiped off the map, of what life was like in those towns.

22:32.138 --> 22:36.784
What they remember about people who lived in those towns, what happened to the town during

22:37.085 --> 23:04.813
the war and so on and the books were published by subscription usually because the only people who were interested in the 50s and 60s were the people who had come from the times themselves they're very very rare and they have been 400 or 500 titles published and this is what we have this is what we have right here we've also found a very small number of books that were published in the displaced persons camps in europe in the late 1920s those are very very

23:06.245 --> 23:07.647
Very, very unusual.

23:07.687 --> 23:08.808
That's beautiful.

23:08.828 --> 23:09.249
Look at that.

23:09.469 --> 23:11.231
Unversht in our voice.

23:11.271 --> 23:14.035
This was a magazine published.

23:14.055 --> 23:14.956
You can leave it in the class.

23:15.977 --> 23:22.746
I just want to see what was published.

23:22.766 --> 23:24.208
Where did you learn Yiddish here?

23:24.388 --> 23:26.831
A little bit at home.

23:26.851 --> 23:29.154
My father and my grandparents are all immigrants.

23:29.535 --> 23:29.935
From where?

23:31.818 --> 23:33.279
Jewish Lithuania.

23:33.359 --> 23:34.040
Lithuanian, right?

23:34.100 --> 23:34.581
Russia.

23:36.822 --> 23:42.748
In the British zone of occupation, there was a displaced persons camp at Bergen-Balsen, which had previously been a transportation camp.

23:42.768 --> 23:43.789
And that's when this was published?

23:43.809 --> 23:44.030
Yes.

23:44.470 --> 23:44.770
Wow.

23:44.971 --> 23:45.831
What's the title of this?

23:45.952 --> 23:47.954
Unzerstimme, which means our voice.

23:48.755 --> 23:52.599
Some of the earlier... How would you spell Unzerstimme?

23:52.799 --> 23:58.845
U-N-D-Z-E-R, second word, S-H-T-I-M-E.

23:59.306 --> 24:01.208
And what is, describes that photograph there.

24:01.868 --> 24:06.373
Well, our work on the cover shows pictures of concentration camp inmates.

24:06.657 --> 24:09.200
in the barracks, in their uniforms.

24:10.381 --> 24:12.303
Somebody's reading a book by candlelight.

24:12.323 --> 24:13.424
What was the title?

24:13.464 --> 24:14.465
The year on this?

24:14.505 --> 24:16.948
This is 1946.

24:18.109 --> 24:19.431
October 2nd, 1946.

24:19.491 --> 24:21.173
It's pretty important diving.

24:21.193 --> 24:21.653
Yes, it is.

24:21.673 --> 24:24.276
It was the 14th issue.

24:24.296 --> 24:30.903
Some of the earlier issues were published before they had access to Hebrew type, and they were done with them.

24:30.923 --> 24:33.045
I don't know if we have any copies of them.

24:33.206 --> 24:34.487
Yeah, it was an early...

24:35.429 --> 24:45.923
This is number four published in October 1945.

24:46.324 --> 24:48.467
They didn't have typed yet, so it was handwritten.

24:48.487 --> 24:52.492
This is two months after the conclusion of the war, two or three months.

24:52.613 --> 24:55.176
Well, it was probably about half a year after

24:56.017 --> 24:59.802
It may have been half a year or so after liberation of the camp.

24:59.822 --> 25:00.803
I'm not quite sure of the day.

25:00.823 --> 25:02.666
Which camp was this in Bergen-Belsen?

25:02.926 --> 25:05.169
Which was in West Germany somewhere.

25:05.189 --> 25:07.231
And this was published there?

25:07.251 --> 25:07.532
Yes.

25:09.314 --> 25:10.255
There were a lot of Jews.

25:10.335 --> 25:14.321
Look, there's an illustration of a swastika.

25:14.381 --> 25:16.984
Let me just go slowly and describe that a little bit.

25:17.044 --> 25:20.288
A broken sword and a broken rifle.

25:20.549 --> 25:21.670
And a torn sword.

25:21.869 --> 25:25.772
Can you just read from one of these for me, or just a fragment?

25:26.133 --> 25:30.517
How about reading just a fragment of one of these little things for me?

25:30.537 --> 25:37.143
If I were that broken, something was particularly moving.

25:37.423 --> 25:40.906
Are there many copies of this known, by the way?

25:41.286 --> 25:43.608
Very, very few.

25:43.849 --> 25:45.130
These are very rare.

25:45.150 --> 25:48.012
Do you call them magazines, or what would you call them?

25:48.132 --> 25:49.834
They were journals.

25:50.152 --> 25:53.337
bi-weekly journal.

25:55.540 --> 26:17.813
The six-year horrible path of suffering and superhuman terror or superhuman suffering

26:18.586 --> 26:19.628
Wow.

26:20.329 --> 26:48.289
That's remarkable.

26:48.539 --> 26:49.961
Inscription at the beginning of the journal.

26:51.382 --> 26:51.883
That's fine.

26:52.944 --> 27:07.862
That's what I would... And these were given to you by somebody who was... I believe a good bunch of these were given to us by a man, a concentration camp inmate who survived the war who lived in Montreal.

27:08.723 --> 27:13.529
But others have come in over the years from various... But for him to part with these is quite a gesture, isn't it?

27:13.729 --> 27:15.111
A great gesture.

27:15.131 --> 27:16.673
And I'm sure to him it's quite meaningful.

27:18.374 --> 27:22.241
There's a page... Let me just do U-N-Z-E-R.

27:22.621 --> 27:25.346
This is Romanized as it would be in Polish.

27:25.366 --> 27:26.087
Okay.

27:27.429 --> 27:28.090
S-C-T-Y-M-E.

27:28.111 --> 27:31.356
Romanized as it would be in Polish, which translates Our Voice.

27:32.217 --> 27:37.747
Publish of a Central Jewish Committee in Bergen-Belsen-Belsen.

27:38.769 --> 27:39.350
Okay.

27:40.091 --> 27:42.214
Very good.

27:42.234 --> 27:42.475
Okay.

27:42.896 --> 27:43.757
Okay, let's...

27:45.712 --> 27:47.274
That makes the trip.

27:47.815 --> 28:05.519
I think Yiddish was actually supported to a certain extent in the Soviet Union in the years following the revolution up until the time that the Stalinist purges really began to take hold.

28:05.560 --> 28:15.313
And in the 20s and early 30s, there were actually these very wonderful Yiddish scholarly academies in a couple cities in Kiev.

28:16.255 --> 28:23.426
and Kharkov in Ukraine, in Minsk, in White Russia, where there was a lot of really fine scholarship on Jewish ethnography, Yiddish linguistics, and so on.

28:23.446 --> 28:25.469
A lot of that was carried out.

28:26.530 --> 28:31.298
They published scholarly journals, which we find very, very rarely.

28:32.119 --> 28:33.421
Those books were very significant.

28:33.982 --> 28:38.328
There was Yiddish publishing in the Soviet Union, which is very rare.

28:38.408 --> 28:40.812
It's very rare that we find those, but we do find them occasionally.

28:41.028 --> 28:42.309
You've been here for four years.

28:42.389 --> 28:46.153
You're 26 or 27 years old, is my guess.

28:46.273 --> 28:46.533
33.

28:46.573 --> 28:46.654
33.

28:46.674 --> 28:46.794
Good.

28:48.976 --> 28:54.781
And is this a future for you, or is this... Tell me about your plan.

28:56.103 --> 29:02.449
What does it do for you, necessarily professionally, with a statement?

29:04.631 --> 29:08.715
Well, it's tremendously... I guess it's the most meaningful job I've ever had.

29:08.735 --> 29:10.697
It's also the most enjoyable job I've ever had.

29:12.128 --> 29:15.052
I mean, I'm the bibliographer, but I do a wide variety.

29:15.252 --> 29:18.376
I have a wide variety of things that I do here besides cataloging books.

29:18.396 --> 29:26.426
I'm the person who drives through the trucks in New York to pick books up from people's houses and occasionally to Montreal, and that's a wonderful thing to do.

29:27.287 --> 29:35.598
There's a certain amount of physical labor that goes on in maintaining this warehouse, but Jeffrey and I do, and I mean, to me, that's something which is enjoyable as an occasion.

29:35.618 --> 29:36.259
It's handling.

29:36.279 --> 29:38.021
I mean, it's being physical.

29:38.041 --> 29:39.082
It's very tactile.

29:39.102 --> 29:39.823
It's being in touch.

29:40.124 --> 29:44.648
Now, you go out and you rescue the book, so to speak.

29:44.668 --> 29:57.160
Do you have any interesting anecdotes about meeting with people and the ceremonial... Ten years ago, we used to get the books quite often directly from the owners.

29:58.522 --> 30:04.908
And you really don't see that that much anymore in the four years or so that I've been going on these book pickup trips.

30:04.928 --> 30:07.330
We tend to get books from the children or the grandchildren.

30:08.035 --> 30:15.704
The owners themselves have either moved from their houses to an apartment or a senior citizen home or they died.

30:16.725 --> 30:21.370
We're getting the books from the descendants who may or who usually don't have any use from them.

30:21.390 --> 30:33.244
So we don't have these dramatic... Sometimes they're quite dramatic because we'll go to... There have been times when we've gone to a house and the person has just died and the child will meet us there.

30:34.506 --> 30:35.747
What is this cut, by the way?

30:36.487 --> 30:38.169
This was the actual pushcart.

30:38.650 --> 30:42.014
I don't think it's... Oh, it says Town Peddler License, BDLR 32406.

30:42.174 --> 30:44.797
I don't know what it was used.

30:44.817 --> 30:46.500
Probably a News Wagon or something.

30:46.520 --> 30:47.401
I don't know what it was used.

30:47.581 --> 30:48.442
I doubt it.

30:48.462 --> 30:50.224
No, actually, this is... A dramatic story?

30:50.505 --> 30:50.725
Yeah.

30:50.785 --> 30:59.997
Two or three years ago, we got a call that Shia Tenenbaum, a Yiddish writer who lived in Queens, had died.

31:00.057 --> 31:01.178
So we went to his house.

31:01.900 --> 31:09.130
This was a very educated man, a lawyer who lived in Poland and Bulgaria and Paris and a few other places.

31:09.150 --> 31:10.632
He loved to write.

31:10.732 --> 31:13.075
He usually published his own books.

31:13.255 --> 31:14.897
How do you spell his name?

31:15.098 --> 31:19.884
S-H-E-A Tenenbaum, T-E-N-E-N-B-A-U-L.

31:20.665 --> 31:26.473
He published his own books and he followed the time-honored tradition among Yiddish writers of sometimes

31:27.263 --> 31:32.511
inscribing a book to somebody, sending it to him, and asking for a contribution.

31:32.531 --> 31:33.593
That was something that was done.

31:33.613 --> 31:36.397
But he published his own books, and they were beautifully published books.

31:36.458 --> 31:37.579
I can show them to you on the show.

31:37.619 --> 31:48.657
When we went to his apartment, we found that he had boxes, I can show you the pile downstairs, hundreds of boxes of his books, of maybe a dozen or so different titles, which he had.

31:49.378 --> 31:55.127
In his two-room apartment in Queens, there was a bedroom, and then there was a living room, and his bedroom was entirely taken up with the books.

31:55.597 --> 32:02.627
And he, for the last part of his life when he was ailing, he had lived in the bedroom along with a 24-hour live-in attendant.

32:04.169 --> 32:08.275
So he had passed away recently, and the attendant was going through his belongings and sorting them out.

32:08.295 --> 32:15.706
And it had been arranged that when the time came, we would be called to the hall to come and get the books.

32:15.726 --> 32:20.132
So we went to this wonderful old apartment house in Queens and moved the books out.

32:20.152 --> 32:24.979
It was a neighborhood which at one time had been heavily Jewish, but it's now mostly Korean, I believe.

32:26.022 --> 32:28.608
That was a pretty dramatic thing.

32:29.190 --> 32:29.791
That's nice.

32:29.811 --> 32:31.375
How long ago was this?

32:31.395 --> 32:32.197
Three years, maybe?

32:32.217 --> 32:34.102
Okay.

32:34.402 --> 32:36.808
Listen, I've got to run.
