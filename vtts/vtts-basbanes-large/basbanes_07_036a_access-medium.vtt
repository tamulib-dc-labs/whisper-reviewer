00:02.967 --> 00:25.111
I've done about 200 hours of taped interviews for this book so far, and I have interviewed perhaps two or three people who actually write speech and paragraphs.

00:25.211 --> 00:29.215
Leonard Baskin, he pointed it out to me.

00:29.235 --> 00:30.797
I speak in complete paragraphs, don't I?

00:31.486 --> 00:33.548
Well, I'll have to look at the transcript.

00:33.568 --> 00:36.932
But I, believe me, I... Did he?

00:36.952 --> 00:37.193
He did.

00:37.213 --> 00:37.993
He actually did.

00:38.414 --> 00:42.118
I used it more as a convenience that I certainly don't embarrass anybody on.

00:42.999 --> 00:46.323
I just make the verbs agree in a very silent kind of way.

00:46.443 --> 00:46.844
Thank you.

00:47.664 --> 00:51.108
And so all those things have to be attended to.

00:51.249 --> 00:57.035
And in fact, when I have a completed chapter, I have no problems even going over some of this material with you.

00:58.557 --> 01:00.379
Because I want it light and...

01:01.068 --> 01:03.191
And I want you to be happy with what I'm doing.

01:04.953 --> 01:08.498
This is a remarkable library and you're a remarkable collector.

01:10.822 --> 01:13.025
Well, I consider I'm owning the top of a totem pole.

01:14.907 --> 01:18.412
And I want my camera to take some pictures of these portraits, by the way.

01:21.917 --> 01:24.721
Without that, I would not be sure.

01:25.863 --> 01:27.565
Well, it makes it a unique

01:28.051 --> 01:34.859
library and the history of American book collection has never been, and I say this and I said it, has never been anything quite like it.

01:35.160 --> 01:41.988
You've had John Carter Brown and John Nicholas Brown, but you haven't had the three generations and you don't have the back.

01:42.108 --> 01:53.923
It's still quite very much a private collection with such a focus that this library maintains and has

01:54.545 --> 01:58.509
Well, I suppose you could say the second generation Morgan was collected at bed.

01:58.770 --> 01:59.090
Indeed, indeed.

01:59.190 --> 02:01.713
Well, that's, again— You shouldn't run him out of the picture.

02:01.813 --> 02:02.974
No, in fact, I haven't been there.

02:02.994 --> 02:07.339
I spent yesterday at the Morgan Library, but I don't mean to at any point.

02:07.359 --> 02:09.422
There was more than one generation mixed up with that, at least.

02:09.982 --> 02:17.150
And there was a nephew there who was quite—Junius Spencer Morgan had something to do with, particularly in the manuscript end.

02:18.472 --> 02:19.753
Yes, he lived down here.

02:20.153 --> 02:20.874
Indeed.

02:20.894 --> 02:23.337
In his Virgil collection.

02:24.076 --> 02:35.934
Tell me, if you would, Mr. Scheide, about your decision to go for the 36 lines, if you can.

02:36.434 --> 02:40.521
It's very obvious, really obscure about that.

02:40.621 --> 02:44.607
There's nothing obscure about it.

02:44.667 --> 02:50.876
It's just the first time we've talked to Salem in over 200 years.

02:50.896 --> 02:53.560
Why shouldn't I try, at least?

02:54.400 --> 03:03.529
Well, to explain something so obvious, we have already so many pieces of early printing.

03:03.549 --> 03:09.956
It would be an obvious thing to try for, just a question of how much competition there would be.

03:09.976 --> 03:11.157
Thank God there wasn't any.

03:11.437 --> 03:13.139
We're very lucky.

03:13.159 --> 03:14.761
Apparently, you had the reserve.

03:14.781 --> 03:17.103
That was your competition as well, I guess, right?

03:17.123 --> 03:19.986
That's my impression, yes.

03:20.006 --> 03:24.070
But even though it was obvious, I mean, it wasn't.

03:25.045 --> 03:31.935
as if the day it was announced, you came in and said, all right, that's it.

03:32.816 --> 03:36.421
I mean, there were other considerations.

03:39.205 --> 03:42.950
Well, the principal consideration was how much your Christmas is going to stir.

03:43.491 --> 03:45.314
Yeah.

03:45.574 --> 03:51.102
As far as I was concerned, I wouldn't like to say, I'm going to have it or something like that.

03:52.524 --> 03:54.867
I would invite somebody else to fight.

03:56.112 --> 03:59.235
and pushed me up, I might say that.

04:00.056 --> 04:13.291
When I was here two years ago, and you were showing me some of your books, you offered the observation then that your favorite item in the library was the 1459 soldier.

04:13.692 --> 04:13.992
Wrong.

04:14.012 --> 04:15.273
1457 soldier.

04:15.814 --> 04:17.676
It was the 57th.

04:18.737 --> 04:18.997
Indeed.

04:19.878 --> 04:25.765
And I wonder if you can say that now, or the 36 line by, after I jump to the top of the list.

04:26.470 --> 04:35.020
Oh, I think so, because the 36-line Bible doesn't have the color printing in all the fancy stuff that the 57 solder does.

04:35.701 --> 04:37.743
So 57 is still number one?

04:37.964 --> 04:55.785
I don't mean to quantify it, but I guess a lot of collecting is the satisfaction of getting something so extraordinary that actually still makes it... You, I understand, are only the third private collector in history to own these five central

04:56.390 --> 04:57.612
According to Roland, yes.

04:58.713 --> 05:01.797
Well, I haven't heard anybody dispute it yet, and I've certainly looked around.

05:01.817 --> 05:04.260
This is the only one that's been offered in 202 years.

05:04.300 --> 05:04.881
That's right.

05:05.581 --> 05:06.663
Huntington couldn't get one.

05:06.723 --> 05:07.724
Morgan couldn't get one.

05:07.804 --> 05:08.685
Ho couldn't get one.

05:08.966 --> 05:12.350
And the other.

05:13.011 --> 05:15.794
And your father couldn't get the 57 and 59 salted.

05:15.834 --> 05:17.016
He couldn't get this either.

05:17.176 --> 05:20.140
Well, that goes without saying.

05:20.160 --> 05:21.281
How do you feel about that?

05:21.301 --> 05:25.266
I mean, you have actually taken this collection and brought it to a level.

05:26.697 --> 05:27.738
An unusual level.

05:27.998 --> 05:28.779
An unusual level.

05:29.179 --> 05:31.702
Perhaps even a level that you didn't even think possible.

05:31.762 --> 05:34.064
Is that possible?

05:34.144 --> 05:34.645
Of course not.

05:34.705 --> 05:38.929
One is entirely at the mercy of circumstances in these matters.

05:39.950 --> 05:41.732
They were good circumstances for me.

05:41.792 --> 05:42.853
I'm very thankful for that.

05:44.454 --> 05:53.143
Is it the kind of... The 57 soldered hadn't come up for sale since 1857 when it was 400 years old.

05:54.001 --> 05:55.022
until 1971.

05:55.042 --> 05:57.765
This had come up for sale since 1789.

05:58.106 --> 06:03.512
Those are remarkable pieces of luck, as far as I'm concerned.

06:03.532 --> 06:06.675
This is one of the... That's all there is in it.

06:06.695 --> 06:11.381
I just... I'm very, very happy, because I can be very lucky.

06:11.401 --> 06:20.451
The 57th dollar was a private sale, and this was an uncontested auction.

06:20.471 --> 06:22.253
I saw a letter from that...

06:22.773 --> 06:30.763
that Dr. Rosenbach sent to your father, and he was offering them, what was it, the horrendous, perhaps?

06:31.023 --> 06:35.809
And he said, well, and you'll never be able to get the 57 and 59 soldiers.

06:35.869 --> 06:37.090
They are unprocurable.

06:37.871 --> 06:40.695
And I quote that letter in my chapter.

06:40.715 --> 06:41.496
Yeah, I'm sorry.

06:41.596 --> 06:43.979
We didn't find that in time for my talk.

06:44.039 --> 06:46.321
I saw the original at the Rosenbach Archive.

06:46.342 --> 06:48.344
We found it this week, and we were looking for it.

06:48.564 --> 06:49.906
You should have called it.

06:49.926 --> 06:50.907
You certainly should have called it.

06:51.477 --> 06:52.958
I mean, I have a Xerox of it.

06:53.639 --> 06:56.222
Yeah, we do, too.

06:56.242 --> 07:03.269
One time we had an exhibit here for Hans Krauss came down and had the soldiers out and so on, and had this letter right in the middle of it so he could look at it.

07:03.769 --> 07:18.824
Another little story that you told me, which I'm using in my chapter, is when you and Mr. Krauss were at the Morgan Library and you were looking at something described as a complete fragment.

07:19.085 --> 07:19.425
Right, right.

07:19.979 --> 07:26.889
And I think that you had said that one reason you were teasing him a little bit because apparently it had passed through his hands.

07:27.470 --> 07:29.974
And that phrase was probably even his.

07:29.994 --> 07:32.918
I always think it's quite possible.

07:32.938 --> 07:36.223
And so you asked him, what does it take to make a complete fragment?

07:36.243 --> 07:38.186
And he said, booksellers talk, booksellers talk.

07:39.108 --> 07:44.676
I pretty much repeat that little description.

07:44.696 --> 07:49.463
You know the story about my meeting John Carter after he gave a talk on American collectors?

07:50.017 --> 07:50.518
No, I don't.

07:50.778 --> 07:54.624
Well, and you're writing about American collectors, let me say.

07:54.644 --> 07:55.005
Indeed, sir.

07:55.325 --> 08:00.112
Well, this is about 30, not quite 30 years ago.

08:00.954 --> 08:04.599
He gave a talk at the Minotaur Library on American book collectors.

08:05.380 --> 08:12.351
And since I am very conceited, at least I suppose I am, I went up to him afterwards and said, how come you didn't mention me?

08:13.352 --> 08:16.497
And he said, oh, Bill, you're just an institution.

08:17.641 --> 08:18.502
So, there you are.

08:18.702 --> 08:20.324
So, you ought to put me in perspective.

08:21.246 --> 08:30.177
Shortly after that, I went to a Bibliophile Congress in London, and they had an exhibit, a special exhibit put on, called British Private Collectors.

08:30.197 --> 08:31.759
It was off Piccadilly.

08:31.779 --> 08:37.506
I walked in there, and hitting me right in the eye, as soon as you went in, you couldn't miss it.

08:37.546 --> 08:42.332
There were special lights on it and everything, but it was the 1457 Solver, owned by H.M.

08:42.937 --> 08:50.488
And so I said to myself, I guess she is the private collector, and I am the institution, which didn't increase my love of the British anymore.

08:52.010 --> 08:58.019
So this would have been before you had the 57, when?

08:58.039 --> 09:01.043
Yes, before I had the soldier, but never mind.

09:01.304 --> 09:01.664
Oh, I know.

09:01.724 --> 09:12.640
She was the private collector, trumpeted as the British private collectors, no death duties, nothing at all, or paying full death duties as private collectors do, I beg your pardon.

09:13.092 --> 09:20.423
Um, and the institution, uh, there's no different thing, of course, according to John Carter.

09:21.404 --> 09:25.970
I found a very interesting letter from John Carter at the Newbury Library of all places.

09:25.990 --> 09:29.435
Uh, he was involved in, did you know Lou Silver at all?

09:29.836 --> 09:31.318
Yes, I know who you're meeting.

09:31.398 --> 09:34.282
I may have, may have seen him much twice anymore.

09:34.302 --> 09:37.547
Uh, but, but Carter wrote a letter to, to Mrs. Silver.

09:38.084 --> 09:43.831
While Texas was, I ran across this because I have a chapter on the University of Texas.

09:43.851 --> 09:44.652
I dare say you should.

09:45.052 --> 09:52.881
And a very interesting thing, Mr. Carter was really one of the people responsible for scotching the sale to the university.

09:52.921 --> 09:55.764
And that was sold to the University of Texas.

09:56.305 --> 10:03.453
And then Carter came along and offered the same amount of money, guaranteed the same amount of money for a self-abee sale.

10:03.473 --> 10:04.855
And so the family reconsidered it.

10:04.935 --> 10:06.977
And then the Newbury Library stepped in

10:07.396 --> 10:08.798
And they paid the same amount.

10:08.818 --> 10:12.864
And then John Fleming sued the Silver Estate.

10:13.545 --> 10:18.752
It's a long, drawn-out story, but it was in that suit that I was able to find all these letters that Carter had written.

10:18.972 --> 10:24.039
And there's an interesting thing about the University of Texas and John Fleming.

10:24.059 --> 10:27.364
I think there was no love lost between those two.

10:27.384 --> 10:28.746
Probably not in that picture, no.

10:30.785 --> 10:36.434
Bill was telling me that when Paul Needham was here, he discovered a 37th line.

10:36.495 --> 10:39.600
That must have been... It has four letters in it.

10:40.261 --> 10:40.982
But it's a 37th.

10:41.042 --> 10:53.082
It does involve a... I remember when you were showing me your 42-line vinyl, one of the most exciting sequences for me was when you were showing me the 40-line pages.

10:53.122 --> 10:55.847
There's no 43-line pages I know of.

10:55.928 --> 11:00.754
So this actually augments by even though it's only four letters.

11:00.774 --> 11:02.056
There was four letters left over.

11:02.076 --> 11:04.880
Interesting.

11:04.900 --> 11:11.408
And they are A-M-E-N.

11:12.269 --> 11:16.996
A note to finish on in the biblical page.

11:18.738 --> 11:22.323
Have you had a chance to study this Bible?

11:22.503 --> 11:24.906
One of the

11:25.612 --> 11:31.197
And the quality that impressed me so much was your complete knowledge of that 42-line Bible.

11:31.217 --> 11:32.498
Well, it wasn't complete.

11:32.518 --> 11:34.801
I just discovered something the other night that I'd never seen before.

11:35.241 --> 11:35.782
And a 42-line.

11:35.862 --> 11:36.322
Yeah.

11:36.762 --> 11:39.665
We were preparing it with a 36-line.

11:39.685 --> 11:43.449
I found a place where some heat had been spilled.

11:43.469 --> 11:44.570
I never noticed this before.

11:44.590 --> 11:45.350
On a 42-line?

11:45.491 --> 11:45.771
Yeah.

11:46.592 --> 11:53.458
A nice big blob of black ink falling over a couple of letters.

11:54.333 --> 12:04.503
But the new one has funny pages, too, and one book where there's a fellow writing a lot of stuff in it, and we'll have to figure out all the things he wrote in.

12:04.704 --> 12:06.265
Some of the things.

12:06.285 --> 12:10.770
Bill helped very much with that, because he knows medieval handwriting better than I do.

12:11.290 --> 12:17.156
And we looked at the paper stuff.

12:17.176 --> 12:21.741
Yeah, Bill made a great job of doing all the watermarks, identifying all the watermarks.

12:23.780 --> 12:39.697
But, I mean, I think that the thing that's interesting is that you really only notice things that society notices by spending time going through the book.

12:40.438 --> 12:43.781
It doesn't have to be systematic.

12:44.002 --> 12:44.302
No.

12:44.763 --> 12:46.324
It certainly isn't systematic.

12:46.424 --> 12:49.888
I mean, you just kind of open it, and in looking at things, you see things.

12:50.273 --> 12:52.397
Well, he did a very systematic job on the watermark.

12:52.417 --> 13:01.013
Yes, but that's because you told me to, and that's because we want to compare it then to the other, you know, to the other known copies.

13:01.033 --> 13:13.395
But, I mean, this pink block that he discovered, or the 37th line that Paul Neiman said, I mean, they tend to be accidents, but you have to, which require over a period of time is a sense of familiarity.

13:14.017 --> 13:17.661
And then with that familiarity that you build on each town, you open the book.

13:17.681 --> 13:19.883
Do you think that 37th line is an accident?

13:19.903 --> 13:24.468
Do you think it was just the only way that they could properly fill out the page?

13:24.548 --> 13:35.739
I wonder if that... Oh, the 37th line, well, that's a very easy one, because one of the epistles was ending, and they had just Amen left over.

13:36.100 --> 13:38.542
So that's where they put it.

13:38.562 --> 13:42.066
The only alternative would be to put Amen at the top of the next page.

13:42.468 --> 13:52.778
It's the bottom of a verso, and you have to put it on a new recto, just amen, at the end of another, of one of a book, and then start a brand new book.

13:52.798 --> 13:57.863
So Ray decided to just admit to those circumstances to do that.

13:57.883 --> 14:04.710
And I wouldn't give Paul Needham 100 percent credit.

14:04.870 --> 14:11.817
I'm not very anti-Paul Needham, but I will, since his name is being thrown all around here, the Discover and the rest of it, I will tell you why.

14:12.050 --> 14:25.968
I had something to do with that, namely that I had an individual leaf in vellum from the part of the Bible that's in this copy, and so I wanted to compare the two.

14:27.189 --> 14:41.888
And the vellum leaf had been in a binding and had been partly trimmed, and so all the text was not there, including on its verso, the bottom of the right-hand column had been cut off.

14:42.728 --> 14:53.277
And so I was, um, found that page, and it so happened, that's at the page where the 37th line, at the bottom of the right-hand column, which is not in the leaf I had before.

14:53.938 --> 15:02.646
So I turned the page out, or he could see it, and I was looking at the parts that were duplicating, and looked down and saw this thing.

15:02.966 --> 15:10.693
It had been cut off in the vellum copy, so it was right there in front of his eyes as a result of my finding a particular page, that's all.

15:11.112 --> 15:13.934
I would have perhaps seen it eventually myself, but he hadn't been there.

15:14.695 --> 15:16.837
I was preoccupied with the other part of the page.

15:16.977 --> 15:26.285
Well, you have to remember that this was what would be within 15 or 20 minutes of the rock.

15:26.305 --> 15:27.086
Oh, sure, yeah.

15:27.106 --> 15:30.589
And there was a great deal of hovering around this book with it.

15:30.649 --> 15:32.170
You can show the picture while you're showing the picture.

15:32.190 --> 15:33.151
That's right, that's right.

15:33.171 --> 15:34.472
We have a photographic record of it.

15:34.532 --> 15:40.157
My daughter is here, pictures of a roller making a speech about the

15:40.610 --> 15:43.314
It looks like we've had all these books.

15:46.277 --> 15:53.908
In addition, I have the flexus bull in this type of ... There, you can see that.

15:53.928 --> 15:56.431
There's the indentation.

15:56.471 --> 15:58.333
That's Rowan Fulcher, yeah.

15:58.353 --> 15:58.834
That's F-U-L-C.

15:59.114 --> 16:00.556
Yeah, and there's Paul's head.

16:02.439 --> 16:06.965
But you can see from the picture that there's a lot of ... There isn't quite a lot of order if you go back to the beginning.

16:06.985 --> 16:07.866
Yeah, go back to the beginning.

16:08.133 --> 16:11.077
And there's a cast of characters over there at the beginning, for example.

16:11.137 --> 16:12.799
Everybody is named.

16:12.859 --> 16:15.583
Not there, but over there, perhaps.

16:19.748 --> 16:21.651
Some people have more pictures of them than others.

16:23.533 --> 16:26.077
I can't describe all that in the cast of characters.

16:27.619 --> 16:34.528
But I've seen that because I was not... I was not...

16:34.795 --> 16:40.422
At the inner circle, I didn't realize that it was the result of this comparison that the 37 blind was discovered.

16:40.702 --> 16:42.444
Well, that's the only reason the page is open.

16:42.464 --> 16:43.726
I didn't know that.

16:43.746 --> 16:45.128
I just thought he happened on it by chance.

16:45.368 --> 16:45.909
No, he didn't.

16:45.929 --> 16:46.629
He did not at all.

16:46.650 --> 16:48.892
So I wanted to put it in context.

16:48.932 --> 16:51.155
You wanted to be there as co-discoverer anyway.

16:51.355 --> 16:56.061
No, I got that page out for that very good reason.

16:56.581 --> 17:05.916
And he'd already discovered a notice on the page of correction, and I was looking at the correction, and then he turned his eye down to the lower right, which was not on the villain.

17:05.936 --> 17:06.257
I don't know.

17:06.337 --> 17:10.964
I don't believe it's ... I read the ... I'll make your pardon, the Christie's catalog very carefully.

17:10.984 --> 17:13.128
I don't believe that's mentioned in the catalog, is it?

17:13.228 --> 17:14.690
No, no, no.

17:14.830 --> 17:17.655
In fact, I have a copy of that catalog with you.

17:17.675 --> 17:18.536
Oh, you have a couple here.

17:20.700 --> 17:22.082
That's great.

17:22.838 --> 17:26.101
How do you feel when something like this enters your library?

17:26.141 --> 17:30.164
That's really very pleased.

17:31.906 --> 17:39.993
By putting the two side by side, have you been able to draw any preliminary evaluations?

17:40.053 --> 17:43.356
I hate to take conclusions.

17:43.456 --> 17:44.717
It's fun to put them side by side.

17:44.737 --> 17:48.300
You can see they're about the same size in books.

17:48.380 --> 17:51.343
Isn't there some thought that this could even be earlier than the 42?

17:51.712 --> 17:53.514
It used to be, but it is not so.

17:53.594 --> 17:54.475
I can show you why.

17:54.835 --> 17:58.759
This is impossible.

17:58.779 --> 18:04.065
The type is probably older, but the book is not older.

18:04.085 --> 18:07.148
And the reason is right here.

18:07.188 --> 18:14.235
This is from that book we were talking about, you see, Jasko.

18:14.255 --> 18:15.076
Oh, yeah.

18:15.116 --> 18:16.117
He does have a copy of it.

18:16.137 --> 18:21.583
Now, if you look here, this is a...

18:22.053 --> 18:22.914
That will not see it.

18:23.254 --> 18:23.355
Okay.

18:23.375 --> 18:25.197
I can read it.

18:25.517 --> 18:26.058
May I sit?

18:26.078 --> 18:27.099
I think it would be helpful.

18:27.920 --> 18:29.202
Here's a chapter ending.

18:29.762 --> 18:35.189
Part of the Bible is not in our copy, so I cannot... I can show you this in the 42 line, but not there.

18:36.751 --> 18:45.742
But here the chapter ends, and then it goes... That belongs with that chapter.

18:45.762 --> 18:46.863
Do you see the text?

18:48.646 --> 18:49.867
Then here's chapter 5.

18:49.947 --> 18:51.469
That refers to the new chapters.

18:51.955 --> 18:58.222
I led that people out of slavery.

18:59.323 --> 19:00.244
So that's the way that goes.

19:00.825 --> 19:03.608
Now, look at what this says.

19:07.232 --> 19:08.453
Here, it begins there.

19:08.473 --> 19:09.254
He's mixed up there.

19:09.274 --> 19:19.245
It really looks as though it sounds like it should be in the short to go with the upper line.

19:19.833 --> 19:26.221
Yes, thus says the Lord, but that would be no sense.

19:26.281 --> 19:29.546
So it's the lower line, all right, given that one.

19:29.606 --> 19:33.330
So thus says the Lord, I, he is called.

19:34.091 --> 19:42.322
You see it goes, ego vocatus, and this belongs with that, but this fellow thinks it doesn't.

19:42.342 --> 19:45.967
And it shows that the copies working with one of these with no such line as that.

19:45.987 --> 19:47.489
That's a manuscript line put in.

19:47.509 --> 19:47.629
Right.

19:47.896 --> 20:02.717
When I was here the first time, the last time, you were showing me how they went from the, how you believe they went from the 40 line to the 42 line and the same amount of space, and they filed off spikes and ascenders and descenders.

20:02.737 --> 20:07.023
If this is the same type, does... That's the 42 line type.

20:07.043 --> 20:07.764
That's the 36 line type.

20:07.924 --> 20:11.569
But does the 36 line type have the spikes that were later filed off?

20:11.589 --> 20:12.731
In some cases, yes.

20:13.131 --> 20:15.695
But of course... That would indicate possibly that it's older.

20:15.995 --> 20:17.177
Yes, I think so.

20:17.478 --> 20:23.705
In the capital letters, I thought about that, but there are a lot of divisions.

20:24.066 --> 20:34.077
In your catalog, if you get the type plot, why you can tell better, and the type plot of the 42 lines in here, too, you can compare them.

20:35.038 --> 20:42.547
In a few letters, only you can see similarities, yeah, that one.

20:42.828 --> 20:45.831
But you can see what I'm talking about there.

20:46.132 --> 20:48.916
It's pretty hard to argue that this one went before that.

20:49.276 --> 20:51.820
It's pretty likely that this went before that.

20:51.900 --> 20:52.861
Oh, it did?

20:52.881 --> 20:52.981
Okay.

20:53.001 --> 20:53.142
Yeah.

20:53.162 --> 20:55.004
Oh, so that has basically just proved that.

20:55.685 --> 20:55.785
Yeah.

20:55.805 --> 20:57.948
It's pretty hard to answer that evidence I think so.

20:58.249 --> 21:02.995
Now, at least the type part in here somewhere.

21:04.177 --> 21:13.029
I'm able to remember exactly where it is, but it is here.

21:13.169 --> 21:15.312
No, that won't do either.

21:16.237 --> 21:16.858
What's this one?

21:16.898 --> 21:17.638
Yep.

21:17.759 --> 21:20.481
Some of them are Janet's.

21:20.501 --> 21:21.362
Oh, different people.

21:22.804 --> 21:23.745
I've done some.

21:34.455 --> 21:35.376
Maybe it's before.

21:35.917 --> 21:37.058
It might be.

21:37.338 --> 21:38.940
Everybody can look as much as I like.

21:38.960 --> 21:40.341
I may have missed it now.

21:40.361 --> 21:41.202
I think I have missed it.

21:42.303 --> 21:46.007
But I found it when I was in here before.

21:46.561 --> 21:52.730
And therefore, there's work.

21:57.878 --> 21:59.120
It is here.

22:01.183 --> 22:11.339
Oh, I'm disturbed.

22:12.240 --> 22:14.644
And he most certainly had it.

22:15.468 --> 22:18.091
There's no question on its existence.

22:20.214 --> 22:20.715
Hold it.

22:20.815 --> 22:21.776
Here it is right here.

22:22.517 --> 22:23.218
That's it.

22:23.879 --> 22:37.856
Now, if we compare the capitals here, the ones that are most... That's okay, sir.

22:39.979 --> 22:43.383
The ones that are relevant... All right.

22:43.403 --> 22:44.665
Let me see.

22:44.881 --> 22:49.505
Well, I know S and, is it P?

22:50.446 --> 22:51.748
Maybe now, wait a minute.

22:51.768 --> 22:53.149
S is a good one.

22:54.590 --> 22:55.091
Where's S?

22:55.111 --> 22:55.852
There's S there.

22:55.892 --> 22:57.713
That's fairly good.

22:59.475 --> 23:06.061
And this is the, you see, that's the 40 line S. This is the 42 line.

23:06.122 --> 23:09.184
I see it's filed down, rounded.

23:09.425 --> 23:10.286
It's pointed.

23:10.966 --> 23:12.187
Can you see?

23:12.207 --> 23:12.307
Yeah.

23:12.988 --> 23:13.909
And this is a,

23:14.581 --> 23:16.183
more pointed than rounded, I would say.

23:17.685 --> 23:23.713
F, to some extent, is more pointed.

23:24.114 --> 23:25.135
It's not quite as clear.

23:25.175 --> 23:29.881
Now, let me see.

23:29.901 --> 23:34.988
Q. Well, that's not clear.

23:35.008 --> 23:38.473
You're looking at O. There's a Q. O's over there.

23:38.753 --> 23:40.976
Yeah, but you're... Oh, yeah, there's a Q there.

23:41.036 --> 23:41.517
Yeah, it's all right.

23:42.273 --> 23:44.216
Yeah, the Q is there.

23:44.236 --> 23:44.897
I'm sorry.

23:45.117 --> 23:46.359
Those are very similar letters.

23:46.439 --> 23:49.703
Uh-huh.

23:51.185 --> 23:51.746
E. What about E?

23:52.287 --> 23:58.935
Yes, that E there is a ... That is quite an E, yes.

23:58.956 --> 24:04.143
And the ... A lot of these are designed basically different.

24:04.243 --> 24:07.487
The C is possible.

24:09.003 --> 24:12.326
It gets more rounded in the 42 line type.

24:15.429 --> 24:16.791
But a lot of them are different.

24:16.811 --> 24:19.794
There's nothing like this in that plot.

24:19.814 --> 24:23.998
The fellow who did this one liked the double lines very much more.

24:24.879 --> 24:33.107
Here there's a lot of letters that don't have double lines, like there and there and, well, circular and there and there.

24:34.088 --> 24:37.070
But look at it in the eye.

24:37.090 --> 24:38.672
He really makes a big deal of it there.

24:39.850 --> 24:44.235
Have any pieces of type survived through these centuries?

24:44.415 --> 24:44.676
Probably not.

24:44.696 --> 24:45.637
No, not of this type.

24:45.997 --> 24:47.979
We have a piece of a 15th century type.

24:48.500 --> 24:50.102
We are.

24:50.182 --> 24:55.708
It's just a Roman P. This type is not certain.

24:55.728 --> 24:57.710
Well, I remember now the letter P when we were here.

24:59.292 --> 25:04.638
You showed me a letter, and you said, that P is probably unique to this room.

25:05.399 --> 25:08.743
And we were talking about a specific letter from a font,

25:09.331 --> 25:12.075
Oh, probably.

25:12.095 --> 25:14.778
It clicks this ball, I think.

25:14.879 --> 25:15.319
Exactly.

25:15.359 --> 25:16.801
Yeah, that's some of this type.

25:18.203 --> 25:32.483
It's probably the same type as... I mean, part of the invention of printing, or part of the renewable nature of it, is that you can take worn-out type and melt it down and reuse it.

25:32.603 --> 25:36.368
So that's why I would think it tends not to survive, because it's a...

25:36.601 --> 25:42.189
Put it in your little green... Same thing with wood blocks.

25:42.209 --> 25:42.710
Exactly.

25:43.451 --> 25:50.881
They could sand them down and... But eventually they get so that they have problems padding them.

25:50.962 --> 25:51.562
Right.

25:51.602 --> 25:55.047
Whereas as a metal, you just melt it down and it's just... At the same point.

25:55.067 --> 25:55.228
Yeah.

25:55.808 --> 25:56.229
That's right.

25:56.449 --> 25:57.030
So that's why.

25:57.150 --> 26:00.655
And that's who I can't remember Janet would know.

26:01.176 --> 26:05.983
One of the English printers after Morris took all his tight...

26:06.284 --> 26:07.586
to a bridge and threw it over.

26:07.626 --> 26:09.308
Well, that's a famous story.

26:09.328 --> 26:13.793
Yeah, it's a famous, because he didn't want anybody else using his type.

26:13.813 --> 26:25.568
You know, he was one of these perfectionists, and it was one of those ones that, you know, in Chiswick that Janet knew about, and he and other people using his type, and he didn't want it to get in the wrong hand, so he took it all to the river and threw it in.

26:25.588 --> 26:26.509
So it's down in the mud somewhere.

26:26.529 --> 26:28.411
So it's down in the mud in the Thames somewhere.

26:29.012 --> 26:29.493
Well, well.

26:30.274 --> 26:35.380
Mr. Shetty, how do you want me to describe you professionally in my book?

26:35.562 --> 26:41.127
As a musicologist, I know you taught music at Cornell, I believe.

26:43.650 --> 26:45.351
Yeah, how do you want to do this?

26:45.672 --> 26:49.815
I would like to, again, get this the way you'd like to have it done.

26:51.577 --> 26:59.224
Well, in my active life, I was director of the Bach Aria Group, which was more musician and musicologist, I would say.

26:59.845 --> 27:02.127
Bach Aria Group, and that is located?

27:03.457 --> 27:05.581
Well, in those days, it was located in New York.

27:05.601 --> 27:05.741
Uh-huh.

27:09.628 --> 27:09.868
Okay, great.

27:09.888 --> 27:10.710
I think that's important.

27:10.770 --> 27:14.396
So, that was just a little biographical point.

27:14.416 --> 27:17.241
I did that from 1946 to 1980.

27:18.183 --> 27:18.463
Really?

27:21.488 --> 27:28.300
Are you still, at some point, I would hope to see the Beethoven notebook.

27:28.769 --> 27:30.211
You know, I see that.

27:30.332 --> 27:39.427
I'd love to see that, because that is one of the truly significant contributions that you've made to the library.

27:39.788 --> 27:42.613
Well, it's rather hard to read.

27:44.997 --> 27:47.181
But it's the only such book in this country.

27:47.261 --> 27:48.303
I'll put my pen away.

27:48.323 --> 27:52.009
I don't have ballpoint pens around.

28:03.751 --> 28:10.378
This handwriting on the cover is by the fellow Gustav Nadebaum, who wrote about his sketches in the 19th century.

28:10.418 --> 28:15.223
Now, wait a minute.

28:15.243 --> 28:15.844
Is it right?

28:15.904 --> 28:19.668
I can't find it.

28:19.688 --> 28:20.509
Which way it goes?

28:22.471 --> 28:22.631
One.

28:22.812 --> 28:23.052
All right.

28:23.072 --> 28:23.613
That's okay.

28:23.633 --> 28:24.353
This is the right way there.

28:25.334 --> 28:27.897
Yes, that is.

28:27.917 --> 28:28.678
All right.

28:31.797 --> 28:35.002
Here, I happened to hit the right page for once in my life.

28:37.265 --> 28:42.233
I don't know how much you know about Beethoven, but you recognize that theme at all?

28:42.673 --> 28:43.475
No, sir.

28:43.495 --> 28:46.279
That is the second movement of the Ninth Symphony.

28:48.022 --> 28:55.573
This particular note book would have been like a sketchbook.

28:56.294 --> 28:58.137
It's not like a sketchbook.

28:58.177 --> 28:58.918
It is a sketchbook.

29:01.548 --> 29:06.275
I mean, where the ideas would formulate and get them down before they leave, I guess.

29:06.415 --> 29:06.756
Sure.

29:06.796 --> 29:13.846
There he says, Symphony, First Beginning, Erster Unpah, and he's talking probably about this.

29:13.866 --> 29:22.740
He gives the impression, and other people have thought this, not me only, that he's talking about the first movement of the Ninth Symphony.

29:22.760 --> 29:25.564
This is 1815, quite the number of years before that was finished.

29:26.962 --> 29:28.244
How do we know it's 1815?

29:28.264 --> 29:30.347
Does he date his entry?

29:30.547 --> 29:32.349
Oh, no, he never dates anything.

29:32.369 --> 29:40.901
The watermarks of the paper, the works represented in it, when they were published, all that kind of thing.

29:40.921 --> 29:50.955
It's a complicated business that has been dealt with by people that know more about it than I. His paper holds up very admirably, doesn't it?

29:51.055 --> 29:51.555
Not too bad.

29:53.218 --> 29:53.738
Not too bad.

29:54.339 --> 29:54.960
He says...

29:55.835 --> 29:59.559
That isn't what I ... There's a sonata, he says.

30:01.121 --> 30:09.851
Right close by here, he has a ... How many of these sketchbooks are extents?

30:10.692 --> 30:13.295
Oh, they're ... I'm not sure how many.

30:13.315 --> 30:14.156
I think at least 20.

30:14.356 --> 30:14.737
Oh, really?

30:14.757 --> 30:15.418
Maybe more.

30:16.819 --> 30:17.540
There's some sewing.

30:19.402 --> 30:19.482
Hmm.

30:21.224 --> 30:25.369
And there, he says, B minor, black key.

30:25.771 --> 30:40.717
And then there's places where he spills candle grease, and then here he has cut out, probably himself, all those pages.

30:42.540 --> 30:45.705
And some of them may still be in existence somewhere.

30:46.486 --> 30:51.475
One time I found a mark on one of these little stubs.

30:52.720 --> 30:54.563
But I don't know where it is.

30:54.623 --> 30:56.185
It's possible to find it again.

30:58.990 --> 31:01.173
Why would you suppose he cut them out?

31:01.193 --> 31:04.378
He wasn't happy with them, or who can say?

31:04.398 --> 31:08.285
You can't put yourself in the mind of a genius, I suppose, a creative genius.

31:08.926 --> 31:10.949
I haven't solved that one.

31:11.289 --> 31:13.893
It's clear that somebody's, they have been cut out.

31:14.294 --> 31:16.758
See, here's some candle wreaths or something.

31:17.960 --> 31:18.781
There's a much better one.

31:18.821 --> 31:19.663
Oh, that's great.

31:19.683 --> 31:19.943
Look at that.

31:20.885 --> 31:26.653
That's page 55, Lee 55, yes, that's where that is.

31:26.694 --> 31:29.878
He was burning a candle at one end, anyway.

31:35.947 --> 31:40.253
And there are quite a number of songs in here, and there's one song here.

31:40.293 --> 31:42.517
There's about 25 or more different openings.

31:44.480 --> 31:45.801
What we call variants?

31:45.822 --> 31:48.225
Yes, they're all different.

31:49.336 --> 31:57.048
And when he came to do something in final, as a fair copy, he would do that in other paper?

31:58.310 --> 31:58.911
He didn't do it here.

32:00.593 --> 32:01.435
Didn't do it here.

32:03.578 --> 32:08.425
Do you suspect he probably carried this around with him, or just... I think it's possible now.

32:09.146 --> 32:12.572
You can... I have seen traces.

32:12.592 --> 32:14.274
Yeah, look at there, for example.

32:14.294 --> 32:15.196
Folded, sure.

32:15.216 --> 32:17.419
Yeah, it looks as though it might have been folded sometime or other.

32:18.749 --> 32:24.797
It might have been stuffed in his pocket some time or other.

32:24.817 --> 32:28.783
Thank you very much for showing that.

32:28.803 --> 32:29.744
Some day it ought to be.

32:30.085 --> 32:39.097
Everything render particular work, but there are something like 10,000 pages that they're doing sketches, and if they put them all sorted out, it will take some centuries.

32:41.040 --> 32:43.103
But this is on, okay, as we're on.

32:43.792 --> 32:49.219
That's the page on which there is a vellum or a production that has been cut off down here.

32:49.620 --> 32:54.627
And you may get it or something.

32:54.647 --> 32:55.969
It's in the case of the left.

32:58.392 --> 32:59.593
Well, would you do me a favor?

33:00.334 --> 33:01.076
A great favor?

33:02.517 --> 33:04.740
Would you take a picture of me, sir?

33:05.321 --> 33:05.702
I'll focus it.

33:08.065 --> 33:08.986
I hadn't even thought of this.

33:09.547 --> 33:10.288
Here we are sitting.

33:15.888 --> 33:24.097
All you have to do is look through that thing with a ray of fire to push that button.

33:24.717 --> 33:32.326
It should be focused.

33:33.727 --> 33:35.449
I can't remember which one.

33:35.469 --> 33:38.152
It's a large one, I think.

33:38.873 --> 33:41.035
Are we both in that picture?

33:41.504 --> 34:05.925
this might even be the dust jacket see um uh see that's the same as that you get it and then um anyway what what what's his name uh um

34:06.445 --> 34:09.168
Paul first said, ah, correction, he said, see.

34:09.348 --> 34:10.029
Look at that.

34:10.049 --> 34:10.369
Look at that.

34:10.390 --> 34:11.591
See, rogavi.

34:11.651 --> 34:12.852
It doesn't mean anything.

34:12.872 --> 34:14.895
So there it is corrected to rogavi, which is right.

34:15.055 --> 34:16.597
It is corrected.

34:16.617 --> 34:16.757
See?

34:16.777 --> 34:17.918
That would be corrected by hand.

34:17.958 --> 34:18.259
Yeah.

34:18.879 --> 34:22.123
They erased this A, and then they put it in the O, you see.

34:23.004 --> 34:23.985
See, they were very careful.

34:24.005 --> 34:26.588
They didn't want any, uh— This one never got corrected.

34:26.608 --> 34:29.832
They tore it up and put it in the binding before they had any chance to do anything about it.

34:29.852 --> 34:30.833
Look at the conditions of this.

34:30.853 --> 34:32.795
Has this ever been washed, do you think, or treated?

34:32.855 --> 34:33.816
I think it's very unlikely.

34:35.698 --> 34:36.199
Very unlikely.

34:36.398 --> 35:05.055
so you see you don't see anything down here but then paul found that so that's how we have this page open because of this that's all and and on this page that when they made the correction they must have stuck in the amen or where was the amen no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no it's probably not washed but it's probably

35:05.204 --> 35:12.474
It's been very tightly bound, and so you can't find out where the gatherings are from this copy.

35:13.796 --> 35:14.797
It does here.

35:14.817 --> 35:14.918
Yeah.

35:14.938 --> 35:18.763
That was, I mean, that's Felix Orian's hand marking where things are.

35:18.783 --> 35:20.746
He went through doing that kind of thing, which is a good idea.

35:20.766 --> 35:22.889
So you can find out where you're going.

35:22.949 --> 35:26.073
But it's a herring binding, which is a well-known English binder.

35:26.133 --> 35:29.478
It's so tightly bound you can't see.

35:29.518 --> 35:33.143
The condition is so much more remarkable than I would have expected to see, I think.

35:33.223 --> 35:33.844
Yeah.

35:34.347 --> 35:38.333
Well, you could hope for a little less, 17th and 18th, then turn a little more.

35:38.353 --> 35:40.576
15th, but that's... Never mind.

35:40.816 --> 35:41.277
Never mind.

35:41.477 --> 35:42.318
You can hope for it.

35:42.338 --> 35:43.039
You don't think badly about it.

35:43.059 --> 35:43.600
Exactly.

35:44.401 --> 35:44.702
All right.

35:44.742 --> 35:46.384
Now, where are the funny things here?

35:46.404 --> 35:48.086
Yeah, show them the funny things.

35:48.106 --> 35:51.251
Yeah, I want to show them the funny things.

35:51.271 --> 35:51.912
Um... Like 10.

35:51.932 --> 35:52.593
Like 10 right over here.

35:54.035 --> 35:55.717
All right, we'll go a little further.

35:55.737 --> 35:58.060
I'm going to ask you to shoot one more when you get a chance.

35:58.080 --> 35:58.601
It'll be ready.

35:59.903 --> 36:00.784
I used to do this Friday.

36:01.445 --> 36:03.628
This could be the dust jacket picture, Mr. Shady.

36:04.047 --> 36:04.708
Hmm?

36:04.728 --> 36:09.393
There has to be a picture of me in the dust jacket, and this would be the one, don't you think?

36:09.413 --> 36:09.833
Well, I don't know.

36:09.853 --> 36:10.414
Where are you from?

36:10.494 --> 36:12.596
Oh, yeah, that's the best.

36:12.636 --> 36:13.957
Well, that's one of the pages.

36:19.103 --> 36:21.826
Now, here's a funny page, one that's so straight in there.

36:22.246 --> 36:23.087
Thank you, pencil.

36:23.608 --> 36:28.333
A strong ink, well, weak ink, see, huh?

36:28.353 --> 36:28.453
Okay.

36:28.473 --> 36:30.635
And, uh... Thank you.

36:30.895 --> 36:32.417
That'll do it.

36:33.747 --> 36:46.024
The size of the book is about the size of it.

36:46.104 --> 36:46.865
Oh, it is.

36:46.925 --> 36:48.347
It's about the same.

36:49.068 --> 36:51.371
So that's why the columns are, well, there are fewer lines.

36:51.411 --> 36:54.255
The columns are the same thing.

36:54.275 --> 37:01.425
One of the things that you enjoy so much about your 42-line Bible, you had told me previously, is that it's amazing how

37:02.317 --> 37:05.063
Yeah, you never get hyphenations at the end of columns.

37:05.123 --> 37:05.845
But you do there, I see.

37:05.885 --> 37:06.887
But you do here, I know.

37:06.947 --> 37:07.408
All the time.

37:07.609 --> 37:07.989
Oh, yes.

37:08.009 --> 37:10.515
This fellow, you remember that very nicely.

37:10.575 --> 37:15.626
It's true, you cannot find it there, but to hear this fellow doesn't give a damn about it at all.

37:16.849 --> 37:21.118
That would almost indicate that, that would almost be an argument that it was earlier, or they didn't care.

37:21.301 --> 37:50.481
uh all right but then you have to put into that the thing i showed you a few minutes ago and then you had that phrase of this is the i was just mentioning how on the 42 you do have hyphenations to end columns and and you do here well but look at the beginning before they got this 42 line bible to work from they weren't even paying attention to their margins um very very opening pages here look at there look at that that's very bad how do you feel when you have something like this

37:51.777 --> 37:54.061
See, look at that, a terrible margin.

37:54.081 --> 37:54.822
What is this here?

37:55.062 --> 37:56.384
It's a preface.

37:56.464 --> 37:58.568
No, that's somebody's correction.

37:58.648 --> 38:02.314
It's probably a mistake there, and they stroke it out and put in what it should say.

38:02.334 --> 38:07.762
Yeah, a Bill Madonis, or whatever that word is, it's a medieval Latin word.

38:07.923 --> 38:08.684
But see these margins?

38:09.906 --> 38:11.188
See how ragged they are?

38:11.268 --> 38:12.329
Look at that.

38:12.370 --> 38:14.152
There and there.

38:14.994 --> 38:19.641
He straightens them out after they got their 42-line Bible to work from, which has very good margins.

38:19.992 --> 38:20.853
from the start.

38:20.873 --> 38:28.023
These fellas in, what you call it, Bamberg, didn't have the same standards, that's all.

38:28.103 --> 38:35.414
The people were doing it, were not the fella that brought the type over, evidently, and they didn't care.

38:36.155 --> 38:38.178
But when they began, see, look at that.

38:38.198 --> 38:42.003
See, it's getting straightened out now.

38:42.023 --> 38:43.305
And see, it's better now.

38:44.507 --> 38:46.049
It's calming down.

38:46.069 --> 38:48.953
It's not very good.

38:49.557 --> 38:53.724
The average is improving, and after a while, you see, it's pretty good.

38:54.826 --> 38:59.915
Now, did you show them where the worn-out type is on this part and the new part?

38:59.935 --> 39:00.736
No, I haven't done that one yet.

39:00.756 --> 39:03.120
How do you determine that, just in terms of the impression?

39:03.461 --> 39:04.623
How do I determine what?

39:04.643 --> 39:05.945
That some type is worn out.

39:05.985 --> 39:07.708
Oh, you'll see.

39:07.828 --> 39:11.234
I'll give you an opportunity to make your judgment up yourself, sir.

39:11.294 --> 39:12.597
Look how nice and dark that is.

39:12.677 --> 39:14.620
Yeah, sure, most of the time it's very good.

39:15.224 --> 39:16.345
Where are we?

39:16.465 --> 39:17.266
Gosh, I don't know where we are.

39:17.286 --> 39:19.588
This might be it, as a matter of fact.

39:31.421 --> 39:31.901
There we are.

39:31.941 --> 39:33.503
This is supposed to be worn type.

39:33.603 --> 39:34.684
This is supposed to be new type.

39:35.745 --> 39:36.626
Newer, fresher type.

39:36.946 --> 39:37.707
Can you see the difference?

39:38.408 --> 39:39.009
Not at the moment.

39:39.049 --> 39:39.949
Not just yet, no.

39:39.969 --> 39:41.451
Well, now, hang on.

39:41.971 --> 40:02.611
Let's see, take that O there, for example, and then this O over here, or that O there, or that E, that's pretty, the general impression, I think, that's, the impressions are wider than here, they're sharper and narrower.

40:03.452 --> 40:05.874
Can you tell the difference?

40:05.894 --> 40:06.114
Uh-huh.

40:06.154 --> 40:11.860
Take down there, look at that, that O, for example, as opposed to that O.

40:12.110 --> 40:13.451
See how kind of muddy it is.

40:13.672 --> 40:15.974
Are these still spaced at the same intervals?

40:15.994 --> 40:17.816
Would it come out to 36 if they continued?

40:17.836 --> 40:18.797
I suppose so, it seems to be.

40:18.817 --> 40:21.620
Well, it seems to be right on top of that line.

40:23.502 --> 40:30.970
I wonder how they would have logged for us to just... Yeah, you see if you hold it up to the right.

40:31.070 --> 40:32.051
Yep, it's right on.

40:32.191 --> 40:33.433
It's matching.

40:35.255 --> 40:39.399
And these red lines go into the... Of course, that's a manuscript.

40:39.419 --> 40:41.121
That's all manuscripts.

40:41.827 --> 40:46.031
Then there is a very bad page that Felix didn't notice.

40:47.193 --> 40:48.714
You know, it's a beautiful page that I had open.

40:49.275 --> 40:51.217
This is the best of the illuminations.

40:52.838 --> 40:54.200
These letters here are the best ones.

40:55.141 --> 40:55.942
I had a picture.

40:56.783 --> 41:06.072
And then the place where there's, you know, over here, I think.

41:06.753 --> 41:07.774
Yeah, look at that.

41:10.076 --> 41:10.156
See?

41:10.176 --> 41:10.857
It all slipped.

41:10.877 --> 41:11.698
It's very bad.

41:11.881 --> 41:14.984
I don't see a single instance of that in the 42-line Bible.

41:15.144 --> 41:16.886
Well, there has been some writing in there, too.

41:17.126 --> 41:17.386
Oh, yes.

41:17.406 --> 41:18.027
Well, that's different.

41:18.247 --> 41:19.188
One thing at a time.

41:19.248 --> 41:21.310
This is the press, obviously, you see.

41:22.972 --> 41:24.333
I'm surprised they kept that page.

41:24.994 --> 41:29.118
Yes, it's a ... That would almost be a page that they would have ... Look at that.

41:29.138 --> 41:29.598
See down there?

41:30.499 --> 41:37.005
The fellows crossed that, the manuscript fellow, or a manuscript cross some of that out.

41:37.486 --> 41:40.909
But that's obviously the press as well as the manuscript man.

41:41.311 --> 41:46.039
Nulla, for example, all that inkblots and drops.

41:46.380 --> 41:47.081
It straightens out.

41:47.141 --> 41:48.263
Everything's nice down here.

41:48.504 --> 41:49.886
At the top, something sure happened.

41:51.529 --> 41:51.790
Uh-huh.

41:51.810 --> 41:51.950
Mm-hmm.

41:51.990 --> 41:56.478
Well, in your comments on that one, presumably what happens is that at a certain point, you don't have any choice.

41:56.979 --> 42:00.124
I mean, you've printed however many copies you're going to print.

42:00.245 --> 42:01.527
You've gone on to the next one.

42:01.867 --> 42:04.372
When you start assembling, you see, well, this is not so good.

42:04.432 --> 42:05.614
You put that bottom of the pile.

42:05.780 --> 42:12.227
but eventually you have to do it over again, or use one of the slightly damaged ones, because they must break up the pages of sites.

42:12.247 --> 42:12.608
Exactly.

42:12.628 --> 42:14.950
They've got to do it and go on to the next group.

42:14.970 --> 42:16.592
So you don't have the choice at a certain point.

42:16.973 --> 42:22.319
Probably by the chance you know this, I mean, you probably do it and stack them up, and then it's too late by the time.

42:22.339 --> 42:25.262
We're not dealing with unlimited types of forms.

42:25.322 --> 42:25.723
Exactly.

42:25.743 --> 42:28.886
Somebody here got very excited about the Philippians.

42:28.906 --> 42:31.469
See, look, there's something rubbed out there.

42:31.489 --> 42:34.032
Yeah, there's something rubbed out there.

42:35.294 --> 42:37.957
Well, you would find out if we tried what that is.

42:38.017 --> 42:40.140
How much time did you spend with the book, though?

42:40.160 --> 42:41.402
Quite a bit.

42:41.742 --> 42:42.683
Quite a bit.

42:42.703 --> 42:43.925
I did the watermark.

42:43.985 --> 42:46.408
You're basically doing that on every page?

42:46.448 --> 42:49.072
Yeah, I did every page.

42:49.152 --> 42:51.755
There are ten watermarkes, you know, from a few of these.

42:51.795 --> 42:57.242
So you identified them all as really a piece of research, I would say.

42:57.963 --> 42:59.305
Would you write an article on that?

42:59.425 --> 43:01.167
No, well, unless we find something that...

43:01.383 --> 43:05.548
We have to get it.

43:05.668 --> 43:08.492
It helps to understand the way the watermarks develop.

43:09.013 --> 43:11.316
Why don't we go with two illuminated letters here?

43:11.356 --> 43:21.869
Well, this is a preface, and it just happens to be a short preface.

43:21.889 --> 43:22.590
Argumentum.

43:22.770 --> 43:27.156
It's called insipid argumentum, I guess.

43:28.077 --> 43:31.221
I don't know why that thing's there.

43:33.428 --> 43:36.714
All right, well, there you are.

43:36.914 --> 43:37.656
That's great.

43:38.597 --> 43:41.903
That makes the trip.

43:42.104 --> 43:45.670
I am interested also.

43:45.710 --> 43:53.023
So happens that the 36-line business coincides with my class, the class of 1936.

43:53.290 --> 43:57.636
You showed me some 36-line type the last time.

43:57.676 --> 43:59.218
Yeah, well, all right.

43:59.278 --> 44:01.962
So they're going to put a notice about this in the class of notes.

44:02.082 --> 44:02.944
It hasn't come out yet?

44:02.964 --> 44:03.745
I'm sure they will.

44:03.765 --> 44:05.527
No, in the middle of April, I suppose.

44:05.547 --> 44:06.709
You talk about understatement.

44:06.729 --> 44:12.557
When I was here the first time, you said there was probably more 36-line type in this room than any other room in the hemisphere.

44:13.058 --> 44:15.201
And now you add... It won't change that.

44:15.281 --> 44:16.563
It won't change that.

44:16.583 --> 44:17.705
Make a little stronger.

44:18.686 --> 44:20.509
Make a little stronger.

44:20.589 --> 44:21.931
Yeah.

44:21.951 --> 44:22.251
And...

44:22.737 --> 44:27.882
It's exciting, isn't it?

44:27.902 --> 44:30.805
How do you feel, Bill, when you see this?

44:30.825 --> 44:32.947
I'm very excited.

44:32.967 --> 44:35.809
I won't be able to find it.

44:36.450 --> 44:38.512
What was your family's reaction to this?

44:38.552 --> 44:42.416
Were they supportive to this decision all the way?

44:42.676 --> 44:44.057
Oh, yes.

44:45.238 --> 44:52.305
Roland called Bill from London.

44:52.994 --> 44:56.278
Then Louise, his daughter, called him from Philadelphia.

44:56.398 --> 44:59.442
I called him from other phone calls, whizzing around within.

44:59.462 --> 45:01.504
It was before lunch, wasn't it?

45:01.965 --> 45:02.646
I think so, yes.

45:02.666 --> 45:04.208
Of course, it would be afternoon in London.

45:04.228 --> 45:07.992
Yes, well before lunch, all these telephone calls were whizzing around.

45:08.072 --> 45:09.114
Everybody wanted to know what happened.

45:09.134 --> 45:11.476
So for the class, I'll have it open here, and you can read this, you see.

45:12.418 --> 45:16.002
Now, the sons of Eli were sons of Belial.

45:16.022 --> 45:17.984
You did not know the Lord, see?

45:18.004 --> 45:20.247
So that's a good one for the class, actually.

45:20.267 --> 45:21.188
That's right.

45:21.348 --> 45:22.630
The Eli's.

45:22.846 --> 45:23.707
Yeah, that's right.

45:23.727 --> 45:27.875
See, there it is, the sons of Eli and Haley.

45:27.895 --> 45:29.217
That's funny.

45:29.617 --> 45:31.140
They were sons of the devil.

45:32.783 --> 45:41.578
So I always thought that if a Princeton minister ever got a chance to preach in the Hill Chapel, that's a text he should use.

45:41.598 --> 45:43.160
The binding is pretty nice, too.

45:43.180 --> 45:46.045
Well, that's Earl Spencer's binder.

45:46.065 --> 45:48.870
But I mean, I hope that's a lot of remarkable.

45:49.188 --> 45:50.129
But a part of 200 years.

45:50.169 --> 45:50.410
Yeah.

45:50.830 --> 45:52.833
And there's a binder's ticket there.

45:52.993 --> 45:53.994
There's Charles Herring.

45:54.394 --> 45:56.357
G-R-I-N-G, bound by C. Herring.

45:57.098 --> 45:59.441
Ten... Probably in German.

46:01.483 --> 46:02.965
Beautiful.

46:02.985 --> 46:05.148
I think that's probably... I would imagine it's a German name.

46:05.749 --> 46:07.991
Just nobody knows what happened to the second volume.

46:08.352 --> 46:08.993
Oh, yeah.

46:09.233 --> 46:11.356
Well, you know, there's four parts.

46:11.376 --> 46:12.617
There's four units.

46:12.637 --> 46:14.299
And this has units one and four.

46:15.080 --> 46:17.884
And the joint I showed you is between one and four.

46:17.904 --> 46:18.064
I see.

46:18.348 --> 46:27.801
And the second unit, which goes from Chronicles to Psalms, I think, is in the Rans copy.

46:28.261 --> 46:34.370
The third one, from Proverbs to Prophets, disappeared as somebody who didn't know knows.

46:35.591 --> 46:36.673
Well, this one is safe here.

46:37.914 --> 46:39.917
But it's nice to have it here.

46:39.937 --> 46:42.921
Congratulations, Biblia, Latina, and...

46:43.778 --> 46:46.263
Vetustissima, very old.

46:46.283 --> 46:47.485
V-E-T-U-S-T-I-S.

46:47.505 --> 46:48.487
Vetustissima, yes.

46:48.507 --> 46:48.927
What is that?

46:48.987 --> 46:49.929
How does that translate?

46:50.130 --> 46:50.590
Most old.

46:50.650 --> 46:51.252
Very old.

46:51.272 --> 46:52.233
Very interesting.

46:52.494 --> 46:52.694
Yeah.

46:53.536 --> 46:54.277
V-E-T.

46:54.297 --> 46:54.898
U-S-T.

46:55.199 --> 46:55.860
U-S-T.

46:56.221 --> 46:57.383
I-S-S-I-M-A.

46:58.384 --> 46:58.945
Very old.

46:59.506 --> 46:59.947
Yeah.

47:00.288 --> 47:01.009
I would say so.

47:01.109 --> 47:03.614
It's a superlative adjective.

47:03.955 --> 47:05.357
Superlative form of answer.

47:06.259 --> 47:06.379
Okay.

47:07.501 --> 47:08.082
Well, I...

47:08.433 --> 47:14.904
I'm fortunate that we had an earlier interview, so I think anything I ask you would be repetitive, and I see no point in doing that.

47:14.965 --> 47:16.147
I did bring along a copy.

47:16.207 --> 47:21.676
Oh, wait, did you have something?

47:21.716 --> 47:22.458
No.

47:22.718 --> 47:28.769
This is the first book printed in Hungary, and there's only a copy in this country.

47:29.510 --> 47:29.731
Wow.

47:30.392 --> 47:31.734
Where does it tell?

47:32.936 --> 47:33.377
It says it.

47:33.914 --> 47:37.539
Vinita Buda, as in pest, B-U-D-E.

47:37.559 --> 47:37.659
Yeah.

47:37.679 --> 47:40.443
Oh, in Buda, of course.

47:40.463 --> 47:41.104
That's right, yeah.

47:41.124 --> 47:41.705
1473.

47:42.606 --> 47:42.687
Wow.

47:44.008 --> 47:51.719
And the putter Andreas Hest, and he was imported from Rome by a Hungarian bishop or something.

47:53.021 --> 47:54.323
Is this a recent acquisition?

47:54.563 --> 47:57.087
A year ago.

47:57.387 --> 48:00.470
This is a better copy in some respects than the one we saw in Hungary.

48:01.131 --> 48:04.314
And it's the only one in... Oh, yes, there's no copy in England either.

48:04.434 --> 48:06.557
How do you find these things?

48:06.577 --> 48:07.698
Oh, Roland got a hold of it.

48:08.258 --> 48:09.059
Oh, there it is.

48:09.079 --> 48:11.722
Oh, that's the best letter.

48:12.202 --> 48:19.430
It's called the Chronicles of... Chronica Hungar... In chronica hungarorum, yes.

48:19.590 --> 48:23.014
C-R-O-N-I-C-A-H-U-N-G.

48:23.034 --> 48:23.694
H-U-N-G.

48:23.774 --> 48:24.695
H-U-N-G.

48:24.916 --> 48:25.396
A-R.

48:25.997 --> 48:27.158
O-R-U-M.

48:28.252 --> 48:37.160
It's a medieval history of Hungary in Latin, and all kinds of crazy names in here.

48:38.161 --> 48:40.363
There's one of the less crazy names, Ladislaus.

48:40.843 --> 48:46.689
That's not so bad, but there's some that are worse than that, I can assure you.

48:47.109 --> 48:48.250
That's wonderful.

48:48.350 --> 48:52.274
You can see the Italian Renaissance print coming in here.

48:52.534 --> 48:55.997
You very quietly added to this collection,

48:56.905 --> 49:00.430
with determination, no question about that.

49:00.470 --> 49:04.076
Well, that's a facsimile.

49:04.096 --> 49:07.040
But there are hardly any facsimiles, at least.

49:07.420 --> 49:08.482
Now, can I ask you a question?

49:08.502 --> 49:11.527
Is this a book that you'd heard of before it was proposed to you?

49:11.547 --> 49:15.773
You had heard of it, so it's not like a target of opportunity, so to speak.

49:18.377 --> 49:20.620
But I didn't know it was possible to buy one.

49:21.121 --> 49:22.322
Oh, yeah.

49:22.342 --> 49:22.963
It's very rare.

49:23.144 --> 49:25.427
It's a comparable rarity to the Besson book.

49:25.981 --> 49:26.962
Oh, really?

49:26.982 --> 49:27.563
Oh, yeah.

49:27.583 --> 49:28.244
No, 11 copies.

49:28.324 --> 49:29.506
No, 11 or 13.

49:29.626 --> 49:31.770
Around a dozen.

49:31.790 --> 49:35.595
So in Hungary, it would probably be treated with the same... Oh, it's a national treasure.

49:35.615 --> 49:36.937
Oh, very much so, yes.

49:37.338 --> 49:37.819
You bet.

49:37.839 --> 49:39.521
And how many of them are in Hungary, I wonder?

49:39.661 --> 49:41.424
Oh, 67, I would think, anyway.

49:41.644 --> 49:42.426
Yeah, yeah.

49:42.446 --> 49:42.946
A majority.

49:44.629 --> 49:46.572
It almost doesn't even look like a printed book.

49:46.632 --> 49:49.436
It's so... Well, that's print, all right.

49:49.456 --> 49:53.001
That's print, but I mean, it almost looks like we could... Yeah, it's heavily rubricated.

49:53.262 --> 49:55.465
Well, most of those books were...

49:55.799 --> 50:09.563
Well, I'm not going to take up too much of your time.

50:09.603 --> 50:12.829
You better give Mark a chance to tell you about it.
