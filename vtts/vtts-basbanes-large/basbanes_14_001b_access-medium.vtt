WEBVTT

00:05.144 --> 00:26.585
But I think that by this point, anyone who's—it's going to be consulted only because someone has a reference to it, as opposed to running across it in the staff.

00:26.626 --> 00:32.872
And it's also going to be difficult for somebody to find it browsing through the computer, too.

00:32.932 --> 00:35.134
Is that right?

00:35.384 --> 00:44.794
Is there a descriptive enough title that it might engage the curiosity of a... No, the title is not descriptive enough.

00:45.134 --> 00:51.200
And because... That's one of your criteria, by the way, on the criteria that you sent me.

00:51.340 --> 00:56.826
Well, that often if it has a general title... That you might keep it here.

00:56.906 --> 01:00.970
If it has a really descriptive title that might...

01:01.203 --> 01:05.508
attracts somebody's attention, then that might argue to send it out.

01:05.528 --> 01:05.888
Exactly.

01:05.968 --> 01:07.369
No, I know.

01:13.416 --> 01:24.107
But my bet in this case is that it's going to be used because someone has a reference to the book, and they'll be able to get at it.

01:24.207 --> 01:27.671
On my word, look, I'm in the book, actually.

01:28.071 --> 01:29.893
So what's going to happen then, do you think?

01:30.835 --> 01:31.616
What's in this book?

01:33.119 --> 01:34.681
There should actually be more volumes.

01:39.128 --> 01:43.234
So what's your sense of this particular book right now?

01:43.254 --> 01:43.875
I'm going to send it out.

01:44.116 --> 01:44.516
Oh, you are?

01:44.797 --> 01:46.439
Okay, so you weigh all these things.

01:47.641 --> 01:50.526
So what's finally weighed in that direction?

01:51.487 --> 01:58.378
It's my sense that it's not going to be this.

01:58.730 --> 02:02.457
It's going to be used because someone has a reference to a particular essay in it.

02:02.477 --> 02:03.118
And they'll find it.

02:03.258 --> 02:07.686
And they'll find it.

02:07.706 --> 02:10.611
And I'm going to send it out even though I have an article on it.

02:11.613 --> 02:11.894
Really?

02:12.795 --> 02:13.116
Yeah.

02:13.136 --> 02:15.660
Did you just find that out or did you know that?

02:15.680 --> 02:17.544
Well, I've totally forgotten, actually.

02:19.828 --> 02:20.569
I don't see it.

02:35.703 --> 02:39.689
There should be more volume, so I wonder what's wrong.

02:41.151 --> 02:45.497
I'll have to look at them.

02:45.517 --> 02:51.505
So it's more than a five-volume work?

02:51.525 --> 02:52.567
Multi-volume work.

02:52.587 --> 02:54.910
I'll call it a multi-volume work.

03:08.997 --> 03:19.783
There you go, Katie Carpenter.

03:42.106 --> 03:46.374
So let's say that, all right, you sign off on these.

03:47.236 --> 03:50.643
How soon will they be going off to Southboro?

03:50.703 --> 03:53.528
What's the... Maybe this afternoon or tomorrow.

03:53.548 --> 03:53.849
Really?

03:53.949 --> 03:55.031
Oh, so it's pretty quick.

03:55.212 --> 03:56.454
Yes, pretty quick.

03:57.015 --> 04:03.608
And they get processed in a very short period of time out in Southboro and are once again available.

04:03.976 --> 04:09.924
So we could go out and actually look at some... Okay, I like that.

04:09.944 --> 04:25.866
And we might even get some more interest in... I thought that it might be interesting...

04:26.015 --> 04:37.569
And look at some different parts of the library, so that, you know, because there are different kinds of issues with different areas.

04:39.352 --> 04:41.995
Plenty of tape, plenty of film, and plenty of batteries.

04:42.295 --> 04:43.176
Did I bring my notebook?

04:44.178 --> 04:45.699
I can't go without my notebook, I'm sorry.

04:49.384 --> 04:49.985
Hold, wait.

04:52.428 --> 04:53.389
I'm sorry, Ken.

04:54.398 --> 04:57.202
That's bad luck.

04:57.462 --> 04:59.305
I've never gone without a notebook.

05:00.286 --> 05:02.489
I've got 42 of these notebooks filled with this book.

05:03.871 --> 05:04.773
I'm sorry.

05:07.737 --> 05:08.178
Right there.

05:12.303 --> 05:23.359
I'm not very superstitious about many things, but a reporter without a notebook... A reporter without a notebook... It's a very serious situation.

05:24.082 --> 05:24.603
I'm sorry.

05:26.986 --> 05:32.274
The last time we were here, there was that aroma of books, and you said, that's the smell.

05:32.675 --> 05:36.741
It's a nice aroma, but it's the smell of books, of writing books.

05:36.781 --> 05:38.904
I'm not pleased to say I don't smell it today.

05:39.485 --> 05:49.920
What kind of a preservation program does Harvard have in terms of deacidification and deacidification?

05:50.930 --> 05:55.159
There's a new lab downstairs that's just open.

05:55.179 --> 05:59.988
We could go down and take a look at that if you wanted.

06:00.489 --> 06:04.197
But, you know, there are articles of all of them.

06:04.430 --> 06:06.612
to do preservation work.

06:06.732 --> 06:06.833
Okay.

06:06.873 --> 06:09.035
But I mean, it's an ongoing process.

06:09.515 --> 06:10.677
It's an ongoing process.

06:10.937 --> 06:15.262
And do you have any rough idea of how many volumes you're doing in a year?

06:15.402 --> 06:17.344
I don't know.

06:18.545 --> 06:21.709
Who would be privy to that kind of interview?

06:22.009 --> 06:22.850
Well, the preservation work.

06:22.870 --> 06:23.390
Okay.

06:23.410 --> 06:31.399
I don't necessarily want to do a full interview, but I'm sure who would love to get some figures from them.

06:36.205 --> 06:40.711
We're looking at some nice empty shells here.

06:41.372 --> 06:53.610
Well, it's because some stuff has been sent out, but that wasn't what I... Now, where are we now?

06:54.170 --> 06:58.617
Well, we're in the section of Baltic.

06:58.637 --> 06:59.578
Literature in Baltic.

06:59.598 --> 07:00.660
What floor are we on?

07:00.780 --> 07:01.501
On one west.

07:02.642 --> 07:04.525
And I don't, you know...

07:04.707 --> 07:28.383
I don't know the author's language, but it's one of those sections where I can experience the story.

07:28.403 --> 07:32.689
I follow the policy of keeping a comfortable environment by every author on the show.

07:36.196 --> 07:37.798
Is this fiction we're looking at, or?

07:38.038 --> 07:44.266
Yeah, well, yeah.

07:44.286 --> 07:47.390
It's, it's, it's, well, less certainly.

07:47.410 --> 07:51.194
It's, uh, it's fiction, drama, poetry, all together.

07:51.795 --> 07:58.723
And here's a, a, uh, a two-volume, uh, work of that, that particular author.

07:58.743 --> 08:05.832
And, uh, so I'm going to, uh,

08:06.250 --> 08:18.813
Keep it.

08:18.833 --> 08:30.233
Here's a... Here's an author where I find four

08:33.706 --> 08:37.952
three books by the person I'm going to send out.

08:39.834 --> 08:42.698
Do you kind of impose a number on yourself?

08:43.779 --> 08:53.672
Is there kind of a general program of how many books you try to get out there over a certain period of time?

08:54.918 --> 08:57.881
I don't have such a number.

08:57.921 --> 08:58.942
I have to keep busy.

08:59.183 --> 09:02.006
And no number has been opposed upon you either.

09:02.186 --> 09:05.990
I have to keep busy the people who are processing the books as well.

09:06.010 --> 09:15.300
But there is going to be increasing pressure to send out a lot of books because there's going to be a renovation of the stacks here.

09:15.320 --> 09:17.363
So it's going to have to be.

09:17.503 --> 09:19.585
And that's scheduled?

09:19.605 --> 09:24.030
Yeah, work is, you know, will possibly begin now.

09:24.719 --> 09:26.963
I think 1999.

09:27.103 --> 09:32.333
So next year, and so at that time you hope to have—how many books out of here, would you say?

09:32.614 --> 09:42.492
Well, I figured that without doing any particular harm to the collections, I can send out to perhaps another

09:42.944 --> 09:44.466
Wow.

09:44.747 --> 09:45.849
Between now and next year.

09:46.129 --> 09:55.003
Well, I can't do it by next year unless more people are hired actually to process the books, unless I get some help.

09:55.103 --> 09:57.126
I just can't do that, you know?

09:58.949 --> 10:01.092
So I need some help.

10:02.374 --> 10:05.679
I keep looking at my watch in the space of about five minutes.

10:05.699 --> 10:06.741
You've got three

10:07.058 --> 10:08.780
four, five, six.

10:08.800 --> 10:09.740
There are about ten books.

10:09.881 --> 10:11.122
I see another three there.

10:11.502 --> 10:14.165
So you're moving along with a pretty good clip, aren't you?

10:14.185 --> 10:15.986
Yes, I do.

10:16.887 --> 10:22.052
And by my very rough estimate, you're getting a book at least every 30 seconds.

10:23.994 --> 10:25.215
Yeah.

10:25.295 --> 10:26.996
I'm doing calculations.

10:27.977 --> 10:36.205
And here's a, you know, this is,

10:37.180 --> 10:41.675
So there they go.

10:42.517 --> 10:47.092
There they go.

10:47.112 --> 10:48.557
But you took care to keep

10:49.921 --> 10:55.390
at least one book from the individual authors who you chose to remain.

10:55.770 --> 11:01.159
Even though it's someone who's not likely to be.

11:01.299 --> 11:03.623
Without regard to the specific work, right?

11:03.643 --> 11:07.549
Because you have no way of knowing what the magnum opus of this particular author is.

11:07.569 --> 11:08.270
I have not.

11:08.291 --> 11:12.958
Although one of these books that I left behind happened to have been charged out twice.

11:13.512 --> 11:15.755
So that was relevant.

11:16.376 --> 11:27.272
When you get into this, do you enjoy it?

11:27.492 --> 11:30.517
I mean, is it something that engages you?

11:30.537 --> 11:32.199
Yeah, you really can get into it.

11:32.480 --> 11:34.462
It's actually fascinating.

11:34.482 --> 11:39.229
Actually, you're running up against books that 99% of the time you've never heard of before.

11:39.890 --> 11:40.291
Am I right?

11:40.591 --> 11:41.072
Yes, I am.

11:53.759 --> 11:56.662
Nineteen-nine percent overstating it.

11:56.682 --> 11:57.383
Ninety-nine what?

11:57.543 --> 11:58.124
Overstating it.

11:58.144 --> 11:58.544
Really?

12:00.006 --> 12:17.164
But then in here, you know, we're in, for instance, into, you know, Soviet stuff on economics.

12:17.184 --> 12:19.246
So we've moved from one west to one what?

12:19.326 --> 12:21.268
Well, to one south.

12:26.075 --> 12:29.160
And now we're in Soviet literature?

12:29.240 --> 12:31.764
No, Soviet economics.

12:31.784 --> 12:32.045
Okay.

12:33.106 --> 12:45.426
And when you see a cover like that, someone looking up at airplanes in the cover of this book, you know that it's not really a scholarly work, is it?

12:46.428 --> 12:47.930
A paratextual element.

12:47.950 --> 12:50.935
Exactly, exactly.

12:51.286 --> 13:00.205
And most of this, of the Soviet literature in pamphlet form on economics is not scholarly stuff.

13:00.225 --> 13:02.490
I don't need to look at all of this stuff.

13:02.510 --> 13:03.492
I can, you know.

13:04.515 --> 13:08.603
So your time, your average is all of a sudden really put a bump into it.

13:08.623 --> 13:10.307
It really speeds up.

13:18.623 --> 13:26.774
But if I were to go over that entire shelf, it perhaps would indeed be something that I would keep here.

13:26.834 --> 13:37.668
Here, for instance, you know.

13:38.750 --> 13:45.559
But sometimes, you know, it doesn't all go because obviously people are interested in it.

13:45.725 --> 13:56.237
When we say something is thin, which I can, of course, in terms of content, but here, very physically, you can tell that it's probably thin.

13:56.697 --> 13:59.360
Actually, it often is indeed the case, you know?

14:00.402 --> 14:03.245
I mean, it's going to be pretty lightweight stuff, probably.

14:03.285 --> 14:05.127
That's right.

14:05.147 --> 14:07.670
And hear the sound?

14:09.652 --> 14:12.255
You can tell no one's been told.

14:16.302 --> 14:22.974
Well, that would qualify it at some institutions for deaccessioning, wouldn't it?

14:23.435 --> 14:25.498
Yeah, I know.

14:25.518 --> 14:29.986
But that's not what we do here.

14:30.006 --> 14:33.973
Well, that little one-minute stop gave you about fifteen books.

14:50.812 --> 14:56.859
The challenge for me is to make a wonderful, engaging story about walking through the stacks.

14:57.220 --> 14:58.201
This is book culture.

14:58.221 --> 14:59.442
This is very important.

15:04.168 --> 15:08.793
Here's a very different kind of section because it's German literature.

15:09.054 --> 15:20.127
And one of the reasons that I knew

15:20.292 --> 15:31.503
that storage would work and that I was willing to volunteer to take it on is because, look, here we have, here's a German novel.

15:31.523 --> 15:32.464
I don't know what the word means.

15:32.984 --> 15:45.656
But here we have three different editions of that particular book.

15:45.676 --> 15:48.679
And, you know,

15:49.655 --> 15:52.839
We don't need to have all of those.

15:52.859 --> 15:58.886
And the question, of course, is which one I'm going to send out to storage.

15:59.807 --> 16:13.283
And it's interesting that people will often prefer this kind of book that's in a rebinding as opposed to the book in the original covers.

16:13.824 --> 16:19.611
So I'm going to send out, you know, one in the original and the original.

16:19.996 --> 16:24.583
And we moved from one west to one south to one where now?

16:24.623 --> 16:25.444
This is where I'm one east.

16:27.387 --> 16:28.769
Is this kind of how you do it normally?

16:28.789 --> 16:30.832
You pick a floor and you'll work the four sides?

16:31.092 --> 16:31.473
No, no.

16:31.913 --> 16:32.314
No, no.

16:32.334 --> 16:38.924
Ordinarily, I stay in my area.

16:38.944 --> 16:42.930
Do you balance it by subject areas?

16:43.330 --> 16:46.695
If you're trying cards like, for instance, if we're doing Soviet and Baltic,

16:47.418 --> 17:04.397
Well, I've tried to go through and take some stuff from all of the sections on the grounds that I want people to have a sense that it's being done in an even-handed fashion, that everyone has to give some.

17:04.580 --> 17:06.602
but no one is going to be decimated.

17:06.962 --> 17:09.625
So I've worked some in all areas.

17:09.685 --> 17:12.428
So mindfully, you do try and balance it.

17:12.448 --> 17:31.448
Yes, but at this point, I think, you know, it's generally septic that this is going out there.

17:32.491 --> 17:52.961
But I'm really concentrating a lot on both those who are in various levels of choosing, which is economics, and church history, and social security, and I'm going to get into philosophy, because we have to replace with compact shelving over there.

17:52.981 --> 17:53.402
With what?

17:53.522 --> 17:54.023
Replace it?

17:54.043 --> 17:56.546
Well, we're trying to put in new compact shelving.

17:56.707 --> 17:57.648
Oh, you're right.

17:57.728 --> 17:59.791
I thought this was going to get rid of it.

17:59.952 --> 18:00.753
It's just too old.

18:01.033 --> 18:01.654
It's not working well.

18:02.731 --> 18:04.112
So it has to be in place.

18:04.132 --> 18:08.457
So compact shelving will remain conceptually as well as— Oh, I'm afraid it will.

18:10.579 --> 18:18.547
And so— This really would have been a paradigm regained if you were going back to— Yes, I know.

18:18.567 --> 18:24.693
But here in this German author here I run across a Czech translation of this person.

18:24.713 --> 18:28.637
Is that an inscription by the author, do you think?

18:29.309 --> 18:40.900
It's not by the author, but it is an inscription to Professor Wiener, or Wiener, who taught here at Harvard.

18:41.520 --> 18:47.486
Actually, it's from the translator, an inscription from the translator.

18:47.506 --> 18:52.291
I'm going to send this out to HD because it's a Czech translation.

18:52.331 --> 18:54.713
There simply aren't.

18:54.733 --> 18:59.097
So there's not that much artifactual value from the

18:59.600 --> 19:11.513
The transcription adds nothing, or is it just a ... Well, I think it's kind of nice, but Houghton won't want it because of that.

19:12.755 --> 19:13.395
It's not enough.

19:14.437 --> 19:15.578
It's not enough.

19:15.598 --> 19:17.160
So I'm going to turn it out.

19:17.320 --> 19:18.381
But it was borrowed.

19:18.741 --> 19:20.724
Books do get borrowed.

19:20.764 --> 19:25.489
Here's a Czech translation of a German

19:26.448 --> 19:29.152
Well, it was borrowed 38 years ago.

19:29.332 --> 19:30.855
It was borrowed 38 years ago.

19:31.135 --> 19:35.242
It came into the library in 35, so it waited 25 years to be borrowed.

19:35.262 --> 19:36.143
It was borrowed.

19:37.044 --> 19:38.927
And you probably didn't.

19:38.947 --> 19:39.508
I probably missed it.

19:39.528 --> 19:41.712
But just briefly tell me what it is.

19:41.932 --> 19:50.245
Well, it's a Czech translation of some verse of a German author by the name of Hammerling.

19:51.203 --> 19:54.107
H-A-M-E-R-L-I-N-G.

19:54.127 --> 19:54.267
Okay.

19:54.387 --> 20:00.135
So that does kind of fit into the category of translations, foreign translations.

20:00.415 --> 20:00.996
Exactly.

20:01.056 --> 20:02.338
This is one of the categories.

20:02.918 --> 20:05.382
Yeah, exactly.

20:05.402 --> 20:07.745
And Robert Hammerling is the poet?

20:08.065 --> 20:10.909
Is the poet, yeah.

20:11.289 --> 20:17.818
H-A-M-E-R-L-I-N-G.

20:18.305 --> 20:22.891
And here we have two German editions of the work.

20:22.911 --> 20:23.773
The same work?

20:23.793 --> 20:24.694
Of the same work.

20:24.714 --> 20:25.875
So it must be an important work.

20:26.917 --> 20:28.219
No.

20:28.239 --> 20:28.679
No?

20:28.699 --> 20:29.561
Not necessarily.

20:30.302 --> 20:31.924
Not necessarily.

20:32.485 --> 20:35.068
But why do you have three copies of the same book?

20:35.088 --> 20:38.753
Well, it's not the same.

20:38.813 --> 20:39.594
It's not the same.

20:39.655 --> 20:41.617
It's different editions.

20:41.757 --> 20:44.882
But the poet was significant enough, certainly, to go into foreign translation.

20:45.262 --> 20:45.763
Exactly.

20:46.604 --> 20:47.805
Exactly.

20:47.825 --> 20:50.127
I don't happen to know the person.

20:50.347 --> 20:54.911
No, if I were just basing it on the strength of what I... But I'm keeping one of those.

20:55.132 --> 20:56.173
Like what?

20:56.193 --> 20:58.174
Yeah, on the stacks.

20:58.194 --> 21:03.159
Then, you know, here's another kind of situation.

21:03.319 --> 21:10.565
Here's Gerhard Hauptmann, definitely, is a major author.

21:11.126 --> 21:13.928
And we have of this... But look, this is all Hauptmann.

21:14.189 --> 21:14.889
That's right.

21:14.909 --> 21:15.750
Exactly.

21:16.253 --> 21:33.300
And of this play, we have to be four— I mean, I see, one, two, three, four, at least four, five shelves, at least five shelves, half a dozen shelves of this stuff.

21:34.698 --> 21:36.540
And this kind of is what you were saying earlier.

21:36.560 --> 21:42.787
Do we have to have, obviously he's a major writer, but do we have to have all of the works of the major writer?

21:43.027 --> 21:46.771
He's represented here, and if we need more, we'll send out and bring it back in.

21:46.811 --> 21:47.412
Exactly.

21:49.194 --> 21:58.364
We don't have to have all of Hauptmann five, seven editions of the play, of this particular play.

21:58.404 --> 21:59.305
And that play is...

22:00.263 --> 22:29.106
It's D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D.

22:29.390 --> 22:33.196
Because people read them well and type easily.

22:33.456 --> 22:52.986
So this function here as well as ... And even students who in general don't necessarily read easily the prompt or script.

22:53.006 --> 22:57.152
And I will come back and I will make selections among

22:57.824 --> 22:59.729
So you've made a mental note here.

23:00.651 --> 23:02.616
Oh, I'll do systematically in this area.

23:02.676 --> 23:09.955
I just haven't been here, and I'm just trying to point out different sorts of problems in different areas, you know.

23:11.860 --> 23:13.504
So this truck is filling up...

23:14.395 --> 23:17.158
Pretty good, isn't it?

23:17.378 --> 23:17.458
Yes.

23:19.380 --> 23:25.146
You must think I'm nuts, huh?

23:25.166 --> 23:27.829
So now we're going in the elevator.

23:29.191 --> 23:32.033
And we're going to go to the 5 East.

23:32.054 --> 23:32.334
5 East.

23:33.715 --> 23:38.260
Which is where American lives in.

23:43.572 --> 23:51.741
I have allergies.

23:54.084 --> 23:58.889
I'm allergic to everything, but it could very well be the cat we have at home.

23:58.909 --> 24:01.532
How are you going?

24:02.013 --> 24:12.584
Al, what's up, please?

24:12.604 --> 24:13.225
I'm sorry.

24:13.525 --> 24:30.209
Well, I've been in here with a book truck and one person before, and a remote truck, and two people, and three people.

24:30.229 --> 24:30.390
Come up.

24:30.410 --> 24:31.031
Thank you.

24:31.051 --> 24:33.334
It's going to get terminals, aren't you, now?

24:33.354 --> 24:34.676
Don't get terminals in the stacks.

24:34.696 --> 24:37.340
That's new, fairly new, isn't it?

24:37.560 --> 24:39.763
Mm, so it is.

24:39.904 --> 24:42.267
I was researching the general badness, who didn't have them out here.

24:42.972 --> 24:49.561
But I'm going to buy a Widener ticket for whatever, maybe a month or something.

24:49.581 --> 24:50.402
I'm going to need everything.

24:50.442 --> 24:54.628
I'm going to get everything lined up and then just come in and blitz it.

24:54.668 --> 24:58.072
Look at all the empty shelves now.

24:58.172 --> 25:01.577
Is this your work over here, all these empty shelves?

25:02.078 --> 25:02.879
Well, it is, actually.

25:03.640 --> 25:06.904
And a lot of that...

25:11.153 --> 25:23.308
Here, for instance, this happens to be an area where there are lots of current periodicals of a general nature.

25:23.788 --> 25:30.977
And here there are— These are kind of like directories, aren't they?

25:31.297 --> 25:37.685
Well, these are more like the equivalent of Time magazines.

25:37.705 --> 25:39.287
Oh, really?

25:39.605 --> 25:41.668
Periodicals, then?

25:41.688 --> 25:44.271
Of the world, yeah.

25:45.753 --> 25:52.041
And this is one from Chile.

25:52.782 --> 26:05.578
And see, everything before 1989, I had sent out to HD, and at some point I'll come back.

26:05.677 --> 26:08.841
You don't kind of go back to your number of half a million.

26:09.041 --> 26:10.042
That's the goal.

26:10.703 --> 26:13.086
That means you've got to move 50,000 books a week.

26:14.467 --> 26:15.028
Can you do that?

26:15.749 --> 26:17.110
Oh, no.

26:18.352 --> 26:27.803
I can't do that.

26:28.323 --> 26:31.869
We'll just have to... Well, you'd have enough perks to do that, I don't think.

26:31.989 --> 26:33.331
There's not enough people to send it out.

26:33.351 --> 26:35.134
Yeah, that's a thousand books a day in a basement.

26:35.194 --> 26:37.457
It's not just a selection process, you know.

26:37.537 --> 26:40.802
It's a logistical problem.

26:40.923 --> 26:49.376
It's a logistical problem.

26:49.396 --> 26:54.584
And so... Well, that's a... That's a dream.

26:54.724 --> 26:55.866
A dream, yeah.

26:56.200 --> 26:58.844
How many books are out at HD now, all told?

26:59.686 --> 27:01.589
It'd have to be several million, wouldn't you think?

27:01.769 --> 27:02.110
Oh, yes.

27:02.410 --> 27:04.894
And you have four modules operating?

27:05.635 --> 27:06.637
You have four up, right?

27:08.220 --> 27:08.740
It's not five.

27:08.760 --> 27:09.101
This is five.

27:09.141 --> 27:10.623
I'll have to give Warren a call again.

27:10.644 --> 27:12.286
I think I'd better go out there again.

27:13.067 --> 27:16.173
But also, you see, in America, here we are, yeah.

27:16.974 --> 27:22.022
We have, here are two, you know,

27:22.492 --> 27:27.438
The Spartan by Caroline Dale, S-N-E-D-E-K-E-R.

27:27.458 --> 27:27.558
Yeah.

27:28.359 --> 27:32.564
And you have several copies of The Spartan by Caroline.

27:32.584 --> 27:32.924
That's right.

27:33.304 --> 27:37.649
And she seems to have been some kind of a, this must be a married name, do you think?

27:37.669 --> 27:38.250
Yeah.

27:38.270 --> 27:40.473
Or one of these is a married name.

27:40.493 --> 27:41.534
I don't know which one.

27:42.575 --> 27:42.695
Yeah.

27:42.715 --> 27:48.702
And so, you know, even in an area of life.

27:53.204 --> 27:53.985
I've never heard of her.

27:54.446 --> 27:54.626
No.

27:54.746 --> 27:55.427
Have you heard of her?

27:55.607 --> 27:55.787
No.

27:57.049 --> 28:00.954
Carolyn Dale Owen, and then she went to Carolyn Dale Snedeker.

28:01.214 --> 28:01.495
Yeah.

28:04.919 --> 28:05.980
She must have been a novelist.

28:06.001 --> 28:07.082
What are the kind of dates?

28:07.102 --> 28:08.884
Early in this century, 20s, 30s, you think?

28:08.904 --> 28:09.946
They look like 20s books.

28:12.609 --> 28:13.150
Exactly.

28:13.570 --> 28:14.451
Spartan is 22.

28:14.532 --> 28:18.376
So this is probably popular fiction of the 1920s.

28:18.557 --> 28:18.797
Exactly.

28:19.178 --> 28:20.359
But nobody's...

28:20.812 --> 28:22.634
even remotely interested in it anymore.

28:22.654 --> 28:27.478
Well, no, as a matter of fact, you know, 1992 it was borrowed.

28:27.578 --> 28:29.920
And it's been borrowed several times.

28:30.140 --> 28:36.226
And the Spartan has been, you know, re-backed, so it clearly had gotten some use, too.

28:36.967 --> 28:42.732
So some of the stuff does, you know, does get some use, and you can't just, you know.

28:42.752 --> 28:49.738
But again, you'd certainly keep at least one example of Carol and Dale Snedeker.

28:50.039 --> 28:52.542
Would you keep a Carol and Dale Owen, too, I wonder?

28:52.822 --> 28:59.891
Well, it's the same author, so I wouldn't feel necessarily compelled to keep them all.

28:59.911 --> 29:04.677
But the books have had some use, so I don't know that I would, you know, tend them.

29:04.957 --> 29:06.900
So you're not going to be that hasty on these.

29:06.920 --> 29:08.562
I'm not going to be that hasty.

29:09.503 --> 29:16.992
It really is possible, even in something like American literature,

29:19.402 --> 29:28.553
stuff that can easily go out without diminishing the utility of the collections.

29:28.573 --> 29:35.901
And I guess that was the point that I was interested in making in coming up here.

29:35.921 --> 29:37.263
That's all over.

29:37.283 --> 29:45.152
There haven't been that many easy choices just yet, have there?

29:45.473 --> 29:47.455
This is Austin Sinclair, I guess, right?

29:47.475 --> 29:48.396
I don't know.

29:49.321 --> 29:55.347
I don't recognize any title.

29:55.367 --> 29:56.468
Bertrand Sinclair.

29:56.488 --> 30:00.392
Bertrand Sinclair.

30:00.413 --> 30:05.798
I don't think that we need all of Bertrand.

30:05.818 --> 30:07.240
The inverted pyramid.

30:08.421 --> 30:09.222
Sinclair.

30:11.084 --> 30:14.207
And so I'm going to send out.

30:16.749 --> 30:18.231
What was that one called?

30:18.700 --> 30:21.685
this title here, the Heroine Bonanza.

30:22.767 --> 30:23.648
And it's not Bertrand.

30:23.668 --> 30:24.409
It's somebody else.

30:24.590 --> 30:25.331
No, but it is.

30:25.471 --> 30:26.753
It's Bertrand Sinclair.

30:26.773 --> 30:27.414
It's another name?

30:27.615 --> 30:27.935
Yeah.

30:28.035 --> 30:29.358
B. M. Bauer.

30:29.378 --> 30:30.039
B. M. Bauer.

30:30.519 --> 30:31.701
Do you use pseudonyms?

30:31.741 --> 30:33.164
Apparently.

30:33.184 --> 30:33.985
How do you know it's Sinclair?

30:34.005 --> 30:35.067
Well, I don't know that.

30:36.289 --> 30:44.002
But I figured that because they all have the, you know, they all start with the same, you know, prefix there, three, four, one, six, dot, three.

30:44.402 --> 30:45.484
So they're clearly all booked

30:46.139 --> 30:48.804
That's right.

30:49.646 --> 31:03.131
So it actually was pretty easy to make some decisions here.

31:03.151 --> 31:04.834
Two copies of the inverted pyramid.

31:04.914 --> 31:07.499
Oh, we don't need two copies of the inverted pyramid.

31:07.519 --> 31:07.860
Thank you.

31:08.161 --> 31:25.456
I just set a book off to oblivion.

31:25.756 --> 31:33.223
Oh, that's funny.

31:33.243 --> 31:36.666
I love that.

31:43.615 --> 31:51.063
So you see, we're, you know, we started out at about half an hour ago.

31:52.805 --> 31:55.288
Half an hour ago.

31:55.308 --> 31:59.072
And if we wanted to, you know, we could easily... We could be doubling.

31:59.092 --> 32:02.916
Well, you're explaining to me what you're doing.

32:02.936 --> 32:07.180
It's a demonstration.

32:07.200 --> 32:09.463
So we just passed some big flat, flat things.

32:09.923 --> 32:11.445
Are these candidates?

32:12.353 --> 32:15.996
Because I don't think Ron Lane has any plastic things that he can fit those into.

32:18.239 --> 32:19.540
No, they aren't.

32:19.560 --> 32:23.744
No, because they're so hard to ship out and bring back and so on.

32:23.764 --> 32:26.206
So regardless of what they contain, they're probably going to stay here.

32:26.246 --> 32:30.991
They're going to stay.

32:31.011 --> 32:40.740
As you go through these books and you see some things that are really approaching, you know, in extremis in terms of condition,

32:42.070 --> 32:44.032
Do you flag any of them for preservation?

32:44.072 --> 33:02.794
Yeah, I do sometimes, especially if I see a book that is really, you know, in terrible shape and that I think needs to be photocopied and put back on the shelves because of being, you know, important.

33:02.814 --> 33:04.235
So now we're, where are we now?

33:04.315 --> 33:05.497
Five West, right?

33:05.617 --> 33:06.778
Well, now we're in Five West.

33:06.798 --> 33:08.280
It's pretty good here, Five West.

33:08.885 --> 33:10.767
And this is Greek literature, ancient.

33:10.948 --> 33:14.733
It is.

33:16.095 --> 33:26.969
And, uh, and it's, uh, it's a real hard, hard one in some senses to collect and choose from for stories.

33:26.989 --> 33:36.141
Because a lot of the stuff was already collected at some point out and went over to the, uh, the England deposit library years ago.

33:36.779 --> 33:52.153
What I'm doing now is simply pulling out some books that were published before 1820, 1821, and we're going to send— Now, what's that little pink slip mean?

33:52.794 --> 33:56.497
Well, there are two different pink slips and green slips.

33:56.517 --> 34:01.822
The pink slips mean that they can barcode it for retrieval in the Hoven Library.

34:01.842 --> 34:03.664
Oh, and they can put the barcode—

34:04.032 --> 34:08.158
So what made you designate this Houghton?

34:08.198 --> 34:09.640
To send this to Houghton again?

34:09.660 --> 34:10.601
Well, because of the date.

34:10.961 --> 34:12.403
We just have a rule.

34:12.423 --> 34:12.864
1820.

34:13.345 --> 34:14.306
Before 1821.

34:14.586 --> 34:16.169
So this is what?

34:16.249 --> 34:17.310
Well, this is 1763.

34:17.330 --> 34:19.473
1763 is here.

34:19.493 --> 34:22.217
I'm amazed by that.

34:23.238 --> 34:25.842
Does that surprise you, too?

34:25.902 --> 34:27.424
No.

34:27.524 --> 34:28.445
This is 1739.

34:28.465 --> 34:31.069
1739, and the other one was 17...

34:31.336 --> 34:34.381
So they're getting pink slips.

34:35.142 --> 34:39.430
But his one is getting a green slip because it's still in an original binding.

34:39.710 --> 34:42.134
So that book will be wrapped.

34:42.154 --> 34:43.797
The green slip will get it wrapped.

34:43.817 --> 34:44.679
No, that's right.

34:44.699 --> 34:45.761
The green slip gets wrapped.

34:45.901 --> 34:48.846
And it also goes to Houghton?

34:49.267 --> 34:50.909
Oh, yeah.

34:51.731 --> 34:53.614
Are they obligated to accept them, by the way?

34:54.421 --> 34:56.943
Now, it doesn't actually go into the Houghton space.

34:56.983 --> 34:59.005
It goes out to the depository.

34:59.025 --> 35:04.170
But if someone wants to read it... That's important, because Ron, I asked him, I said, do you have books here from the Houghton Library?

35:04.190 --> 35:04.951
He said, yes, we do.

35:05.671 --> 35:15.160
And I said, you know, then I also wrote, well, the likelihood of an extremely rare item being out there is unlikely, but nevertheless, there are some books.

35:15.260 --> 35:16.882
Now, look at that, see?

35:16.942 --> 35:20.685
Now, would you flag that for being to be rebound, or what?

35:21.486 --> 35:21.666
No.

35:22.047 --> 35:22.487
No.

35:23.210 --> 35:24.632
It might be bound but repaired.

35:26.695 --> 35:30.842
Now, the next person who uses that is going to probably cause some damage to it.

35:30.862 --> 35:40.817
Actually, I'm going to send this out to the depository, though, and this will get wrapped up, maybe even put in a box before it goes out.

35:40.837 --> 35:41.618
That'll be done here.

35:41.798 --> 35:43.020
That'll be done here.

35:43.040 --> 35:49.530
Because all they're going to do out there is give it its own barcode and stick it in the top shelf because there's a small book.

35:49.671 --> 35:51.353
That's right.

35:51.373 --> 35:51.934
That's right.

35:52.319 --> 36:07.840
Now, there are others here, like this, so that, you know, you find... 1818, this is the green.

36:07.880 --> 36:08.280
1818.

36:08.841 --> 36:11.405
Yeah, that's a green seal.

36:11.425 --> 36:13.047
And the significance of 1821, once again?

36:13.067 --> 36:16.892
Yeah, the idea was that it's

36:17.243 --> 36:33.926
It's before the age of, you know, modern scholarship and before the... The assets started getting into the paper, too, you know?

36:34.247 --> 36:42.919
Yeah, and it's still, you know, it's still the older, you know, technology for printing, for modern printing technology.

36:42.939 --> 36:45.482
So there's some artifactual value to it.

36:45.502 --> 36:46.744
Well, of course, the more...

36:46.943 --> 36:52.450
Modern books also have their artifactual value, don't they?

36:52.470 --> 37:06.029
But it's mainly the idea that scholarship is better, stronger, substantial.

37:06.049 --> 37:09.814
The modern scholarship, it is before the era.

37:10.254 --> 37:14.660
They've clearly passed these Xenophon writings.

37:14.960 --> 37:16.883
You didn't even look at them.

37:17.217 --> 37:23.406
It's just because there are so many here I didn't want to take up your time with putting slips in all of these.

37:23.426 --> 37:26.611
But clearly this area is going to require more of your time.

37:26.631 --> 37:26.891
It is.

37:27.272 --> 37:27.753
It is.

37:27.773 --> 37:29.415
I've got to come back.

37:29.435 --> 37:38.388
And, you know, I hate to see that label going, but we can't do anything about it.

37:38.408 --> 37:42.955
We're looking at a label on a leather, an old, very old book.

37:43.458 --> 37:45.040
Well, it's a Xenophon, right?

37:45.060 --> 37:45.280
Yeah.

37:45.701 --> 37:55.994
It's a 1798 Xenophon, and it really is, you know, we just can't do anything about it.

37:56.154 --> 38:00.720
I'll stick the label inside, and who knows, but it might still be there.

38:00.740 --> 38:01.781
It might be a survivor.

38:01.861 --> 38:02.582
One never knows.

38:02.702 --> 38:03.844
We can't.

38:03.864 --> 38:06.748
We just can't.

38:07.529 --> 38:09.431
Can't do it.

38:09.451 --> 38:10.292
Can't do it.

38:11.572 --> 38:16.619
And, of course, the Latin literature is the same kind of issue.

38:16.639 --> 38:22.868
These books are, you know, are heavily, heavily used.

38:22.888 --> 38:25.592
The, uh... The Ophrastus.

38:26.594 --> 38:38.491
You know, here, you know, 1982, 84, 92, you know... This is taking down some random... 90, 91, 92, 93.

38:38.932 --> 38:39.773
So that, you know...

38:41.221 --> 38:55.080
You can't just, you know, there's this—you can't just say, you know, who reads that stuff?

38:55.100 --> 38:57.423
Oh, you've got a huge classics department here.

38:57.543 --> 38:59.045
Exactly, exactly.

38:59.065 --> 39:07.296
And the drama department, you know, and the history department, so we're not just talking— Well, these are modern periodicals, but that's another matter.

39:10.280 --> 39:10.680
That's right.

39:10.781 --> 39:12.242
Greek periodical is here.

39:12.823 --> 39:15.626
And look at all the Greek literature, ancient.

39:15.967 --> 39:18.790
It's a pretty substantial section, isn't it?

39:19.952 --> 39:22.154
It is.

39:22.715 --> 39:22.995
It is.

39:23.015 --> 39:31.325
And then the Latin is also substantial.

39:31.345 --> 39:32.066
Do you want one of these?

39:32.126 --> 39:33.688
I carry them.

39:44.755 --> 39:45.476
No, we are.

39:45.837 --> 39:47.299
Latin, Latin literature.

39:48.621 --> 39:51.926
So a similar drill is going to take place here, right?

39:51.946 --> 39:54.510
Yeah.

39:54.691 --> 40:03.905
And I could easily, you know, come up and fill up a tug.

40:04.066 --> 40:05.247
Lots of original, of course.

40:08.593 --> 40:11.978
But one of the things about, whereas, you know,

40:12.532 --> 40:20.142
We were looking at the Erhard Hauptmann and different editions, and I was feeling we only needed one.

40:21.244 --> 40:38.708
Part of the scholarship in classics is that people compare different editions edited by different people, so you can't simply come up and say, well, all we need is one edition of Virgil.

40:42.282 --> 40:47.088
You could really say the same thing about Shakespeare, too, of course, with all the different editions of Shakespeare along the way.

40:48.109 --> 40:51.453
Yeah.

40:51.473 --> 41:08.353
So you really have to... You see, you're making decisions in 20 seconds that's based on, I don't know how many years you've been at this, 40, 30 years or whatever of experience.

41:08.713 --> 41:10.095
I mean, you're telling me things...

41:11.037 --> 41:17.703
that you know instantly that it could go into this equation in a matter of microseconds.

41:17.923 --> 41:39.141
And I talk to a lot of faculty.

41:39.161 --> 41:40.943
This is another kind of interesting...

41:42.053 --> 41:42.534
case.

41:42.634 --> 42:02.477
And you can tell just by looking at this, this is a popular edition of Virgil's Georgics and by Harriet Waters.

42:02.677 --> 42:07.883
Yeah, translated by a woman published in Boston in 1881.

42:10.065 --> 42:11.487
And one could argue, you know,

42:12.243 --> 42:15.927
Do we need any of those in the stacks?

42:15.947 --> 42:32.244
On the other hand, Roger Stoddard has strongly urged me to keep in the stacks some books, enough books so that someone can get a feel for the 19th century book.

42:32.264 --> 42:35.508
So I'm going to put back one of those.

42:37.810 --> 42:39.752
But that's three copies of the same book, right?

42:40.238 --> 42:45.583
Yeah, but I'm not going to reject any of these.

42:45.603 --> 42:53.271
I mean, I'm going to store them all rather than reject them from the collection, even though they're the same book, because this is the predecessor.

42:53.792 --> 42:54.933
What do you mean, reject?

42:54.953 --> 42:55.554
I don't understand.

42:55.654 --> 43:00.619
Well, every now and then, you know, if we have, you know, enough copies of a book.

43:01.299 --> 43:03.422
So we're grooming a little bit then, aren't we?

43:03.442 --> 43:05.103
Well, some.

43:05.123 --> 43:08.727
There's some grooming, indeed.

43:09.449 --> 43:20.300
For instance, there was about ten copies of a fresh shirt for a Harvard professor down there.

43:20.320 --> 43:21.441
I ran across ones.

43:21.461 --> 43:28.789
You know, we really don't need to store ten copies of that book because we pay in perpetuity.

43:31.591 --> 43:38.038
But I will always keep every copy of the book.

43:38.187 --> 43:45.576
James R. Osgood was the president of the firm because we have the ledgers for the firm.

43:47.418 --> 43:48.199
That's 1881.

43:48.479 --> 43:50.862
So you never know.

43:50.882 --> 44:05.560
Now, I confess I've done a little bit of weeding and stuff, but only when there are multiple companies.

44:05.580 --> 44:07.182
Compelling reasons to do so.

44:07.381 --> 44:26.230
Only when there are multiple copies and there's no danger that the book is going to be lost from the university.

44:26.250 --> 44:26.771
That's right.

44:31.718 --> 44:32.019
Oh, I'm sorry.

44:32.039 --> 44:32.359
Another one.

44:37.638 --> 44:39.961
You don't forget anything.

44:39.981 --> 44:40.982
Every book.

44:54.377 --> 44:54.798
Excellent.

44:55.158 --> 44:57.761
So, you know, we could always do more of it.

44:57.781 --> 44:58.862
I think we've got it.

44:58.962 --> 44:59.443
I've got it.

45:01.702 --> 45:05.928
I want to spend a little time with that German book out of my copying room.

45:06.108 --> 45:07.891
Would that tell them then?

45:08.892 --> 45:09.733
If you don't mind, yeah.

45:09.753 --> 45:12.577
Go out and get myself some dimes or quarters or whatever I need.

45:15.562 --> 45:16.002
That's great.

45:16.503 --> 45:17.645
I didn't want to buy that book.

45:17.765 --> 45:18.786
I thought that it might be.

45:20.769 --> 45:23.192
That's the kind of book that costs you 80 bucks or something like that.

45:23.793 --> 45:24.735
No, it's not worth it.

45:24.755 --> 45:26.477
It's not worth it.
