WEBVTT

00:03.338 --> 00:14.008
He had a very humane regime in that country, which he was in, were not used to.

00:14.048 --> 00:16.551
The Portuguese are not so present.

00:16.571 --> 00:18.753
That's true.

00:18.773 --> 00:33.227
So he brought with him and staff of all kinds of good people, scientists, artists.

00:35.418 --> 00:42.185
Onspot, the topography of the country.

00:42.426 --> 00:44.688
Describe the life and then the animals.

00:44.708 --> 00:46.410
That's this book.

00:46.430 --> 00:48.152
That was one of the books, yeah.

00:48.172 --> 00:49.393
And can you remember the title of it?

00:49.413 --> 00:55.800
And that is, it's a book devoted to the greatness of this prince, Moritz.

00:56.802 --> 01:02.708
It's called Maurizia das M-A-U-R

01:05.000 --> 01:11.371
I-T-I-A-D-O-S.

01:11.972 --> 01:12.232
D?

01:12.613 --> 01:13.454
D-O-S.

01:14.456 --> 01:15.077
D or T?

01:15.377 --> 01:16.559
D. D-O-S.

01:16.820 --> 01:18.142
Moritiados.

01:18.162 --> 01:18.883
Moritiados.

01:19.765 --> 01:25.154
And by the court... Master?

01:25.174 --> 01:25.314
Uh-huh.

01:25.795 --> 01:28.760
Court, right.

01:28.780 --> 01:29.421
I know what you mean.

01:29.857 --> 01:33.840
I can't think of it.

01:33.920 --> 01:36.022
I know what you mean, though.

01:36.042 --> 01:38.364
A man called Plante.

01:39.005 --> 01:42.348
B-L-A-N-T-E.

01:42.368 --> 01:43.809
So you found this in Denmark?

01:43.829 --> 01:44.890
I found it in Denmark.

01:45.350 --> 01:48.293
And I must say, I found it for it.

01:48.313 --> 01:49.274
Absolutely nothing.

01:49.294 --> 01:54.378
I couldn't even pay out of it.

01:54.398 --> 01:59.222
That, when I came back, the book was completed, and everything is very, very completed.

01:59.742 --> 02:01.304
That's one volume.

02:01.725 --> 02:02.105
One volume.

02:02.826 --> 02:06.071
But beautiful place, beautiful place.

02:06.171 --> 02:07.312
And what year is the book?

02:07.332 --> 02:08.554
1600.

02:08.634 --> 02:08.994
Wow.

02:10.777 --> 02:13.521
Seven, seven or eight.

02:13.961 --> 02:14.622
Printed where?

02:14.762 --> 02:15.363
In Brazil?

02:15.503 --> 02:16.424
No, in Amsterdam.

02:16.445 --> 02:16.945
In Amsterdam.

02:19.008 --> 02:19.769
Great, great book.

02:20.750 --> 02:26.458
So when I went to check in the first library that I could compare copy and they found out they didn't have the...

02:27.130 --> 02:37.341
And I only knew what I had to pay for it.

02:37.361 --> 02:38.362
I never had a coffee.

02:38.382 --> 02:39.663
I didn't know much about the coffee.

02:39.683 --> 02:40.624
So I mentioned the price.

02:41.685 --> 02:42.927
He snapped it up, right?

02:42.947 --> 02:44.508
And he said, that's good.

02:44.528 --> 02:45.710
Yeah, all right, Nicole.

02:45.930 --> 02:47.552
That's something I'm going to buy.

02:48.072 --> 02:55.500
But then I found out when he said something like that, you could be sure you sold much under the price.

02:55.919 --> 03:01.868
Because next week or next month, I got a catalog from one of the great, great German dealers from before the war.

03:02.629 --> 03:05.193
It was already in there for thousands of marks.

03:05.774 --> 03:08.298
And probably not nearly as nice as this one.

03:08.318 --> 03:08.939
But I don't know.

03:08.979 --> 03:10.581
It was a good book, sounds like that.

03:10.621 --> 03:11.563
I find a good copy.

03:12.945 --> 03:15.268
But it was what it was.

03:15.669 --> 03:20.656
Now, I never regretted that when I had sold something.

03:20.676 --> 03:22.399
It was clearly it was.

03:22.750 --> 03:31.442
It was satisfactory to you, otherwise you wouldn't have... It was satisfactory to me, and in those days, hundreds of guilders, it was problems.

03:31.583 --> 03:34.387
I mean, for three of the guilders, you could live in months.

03:36.610 --> 03:38.773
And you sold that to the University of Amsterdam.

03:39.694 --> 03:40.095
Oh.

03:40.235 --> 03:42.859
That's here, so that's here.

03:43.219 --> 03:47.646
I just had my hands on it.

03:48.086 --> 03:52.032
I forgot, and that is where I, in a way, started.

03:52.973 --> 03:54.375
Yes, thank you.

03:54.395 --> 03:55.216
Dutch cookie.

03:55.236 --> 03:55.737
It looks good.

04:03.727 --> 04:05.910
Why do you suppose the book was so reasonable in Denmark?

04:08.213 --> 04:09.895
Because in Denmark they needed money.

04:11.237 --> 04:13.199
Everywhere they needed money.

04:15.262 --> 04:21.630
Denmark was just out on the occupation and some of them had the occupation.

04:22.471 --> 04:23.392
only in money.

04:24.433 --> 04:29.440
Nobody had money.

04:29.460 --> 04:46.681
In all of after the war, money around like flies in tropical countries, some day did that government decided that you had to deliver in all your money.

04:46.721 --> 04:48.103
You couldn't deliver it in.

04:48.123 --> 04:51.988
You couldn't get any compensation.

04:52.424 --> 04:54.767
And you could get out with ten guilders.

04:55.007 --> 04:55.768
That was it.

04:56.449 --> 04:57.891
Then you had to start all over again.

04:59.713 --> 05:00.274
I understand.

05:00.374 --> 05:02.497
You bring in your cash, is that right?

05:03.658 --> 05:05.441
And why were you supposed to bring it in?

05:07.483 --> 05:10.868
Because of too much cheap money being around.

05:10.888 --> 05:13.631
Inflation and... So they were going to start all over again.

05:14.593 --> 05:15.213
Ten guilders.

05:15.854 --> 05:18.678
Ten guilders could buy you, I don't know, food for a week.

05:19.599 --> 05:20.440
And that was it.

05:22.445 --> 05:23.648
This is right after the war.

05:25.451 --> 05:29.721
So when you would, was it the same terms in Denmark?

05:29.741 --> 05:30.482
In a way, yeah.

05:30.502 --> 05:32.066
A foreign currency that you'd bring in?

05:32.086 --> 05:32.727
In general.

05:33.328 --> 05:41.466
I mean, did you make the same arrangement with them, that give me the books, and when I sell it, I'll pay you a... No, it is, but I would pay you straight away.

05:42.205 --> 05:42.886
You're smiling.

05:43.867 --> 05:51.338
No, I'm not smiling because I would have seen them at a higher size, but that was not a thing.

05:51.358 --> 05:53.160
To find the book, that was a thing.

05:53.180 --> 05:58.267
And because you have to realize in Denmark, they don't realize the significance of the book in Holland.

05:58.287 --> 06:11.385
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

06:11.551 --> 06:12.532
I asked him a lot.

06:12.552 --> 06:13.754
He'd tell you the price.

06:14.154 --> 06:16.578
And the fact is, you didn't sell it for a tremendous amount either?

06:16.598 --> 06:17.559
No, no.

06:17.579 --> 06:18.380
A modest amount.

06:18.881 --> 06:20.603
I mean, it's a good profit.

06:20.683 --> 06:22.465
And it must please you that it's in a good place?

06:22.826 --> 06:26.170
It's the best place in the world.

06:26.190 --> 06:32.799
And does that matter to you, that your books find the best home?

06:33.260 --> 06:34.041
No.

06:34.101 --> 06:39.668
It's something I've always tried to achieve.

06:41.099 --> 06:56.498
I always, not always, but in many cases, I was very sad and mad when I had decided this book was there and there and they didn't buy it.

06:59.722 --> 07:06.150
And generally I was right because after all they should have bought it and they only told me they should have bought it.

07:06.170 --> 07:08.052
Afterwards, when it was too late.

07:10.799 --> 07:17.189
So you're not one of these booksellers who says, I don't want to sell to institutions.

07:17.329 --> 07:20.654
You'd much rather sell to keep the book in circulation.

07:21.115 --> 07:25.021
When you feel a book belongs someplace, that's most important.

07:25.041 --> 07:30.029
First, the librarian of the Amsterdam University library.

07:30.049 --> 07:38.342
Then, besides being a good true friend and teacher and columnist,

07:39.419 --> 07:48.995
He was a man who knew books, had to know the specialty better than anybody had ever met after.

07:52.881 --> 07:57.589
He loved books, he loved the language, knew what was good.

07:58.049 --> 08:00.313
He had, he could provide the money.

08:01.323 --> 08:04.849
You see, that's very important, you know, that... That's right.

08:04.869 --> 08:12.320
...there's nothing in that rare who wants to buy a notice that has to say, I'm sorry, I have no money for you.

08:12.340 --> 08:16.587
And I came, they did book the same book, that was another one.

08:16.607 --> 08:19.091
And I didn't make the money for it.

08:19.231 --> 08:22.576
So they told me that, yes, we're going to buy it.

08:22.596 --> 08:24.840
He knew instantly the importance of the book.

08:24.860 --> 08:28.225
Yeah, but he was much more trained.

08:28.610 --> 08:32.375
But he didn't betray his enthusiasm, did he?

08:32.395 --> 08:33.036
Not at all.

08:33.157 --> 08:36.281
He was very cool in that respect, and rightly so.

08:37.823 --> 08:57.992
He treated me like a human being, which was already rare in this country too, because the rare book man was not a very esteemed person, dealer.

08:58.327 --> 08:59.488
I'm not going to call it.

09:00.429 --> 09:00.709
Not?

09:01.690 --> 09:01.871
No.

09:02.371 --> 09:04.633
In your country, in the United States.

09:05.454 --> 09:19.268
When I came for the first time to the United States, the difference in the approach... There was no commission.

09:19.288 --> 09:24.874
And yet the European scholar, bookseller, I think to myself, that is the ideal.

09:25.208 --> 09:30.634
bookseller yourself, the bookseller who understands the significance of the book.

09:32.136 --> 09:37.562
I'm sure there have been occasions where you've discovered a book and you've explained to an institution why they should have it.

09:37.803 --> 09:39.064
Absolutely.

09:39.084 --> 09:45.432
And you've done, and go ahead, maybe you could... No, but that is exactly what happened, yeah.

09:45.452 --> 09:49.036
And how do you determine, how do you determine the importance of the book?

09:50.638 --> 09:51.859
I don't know.

09:51.879 --> 09:52.600
I honestly don't.

09:53.626 --> 10:03.179
I start buying it because I know that when you don't buy it, you won't probably ever see it again.

10:03.960 --> 10:05.141
So there's no chance.

10:05.942 --> 10:06.944
And you want to buy it.

10:10.969 --> 10:21.523
And I learned one thing in my life that is a real customer, a real client for the book is always, he's already born, he's already dead, only three years.

10:21.807 --> 10:26.254
Say that again now.

10:26.274 --> 10:32.243
The buyer who wants to buy it, the client, he's already born.

10:32.283 --> 10:32.904
He's there.

10:33.144 --> 10:35.648
The only thing is you have to find him.

10:35.668 --> 10:36.810
I have to find you.

10:36.830 --> 10:37.731
More happens.

10:37.892 --> 10:41.958
More often happens.

10:41.978 --> 10:43.640
So you absolutely believe that.

10:43.680 --> 10:47.947
The person who is correct for this book is out there somewhere.

10:47.987 --> 10:48.608
Somewhere.

10:48.908 --> 10:50.510
It's my job to find this.

10:50.530 --> 10:53.594
It's only my job to find me, or his job to find you.

10:55.256 --> 10:58.461
And generally speaking, if you have the book, do you think they will find you?

10:58.721 --> 10:59.362
Absolutely.

11:00.043 --> 11:00.644
There's no place.

11:02.626 --> 11:08.494
Somewhere in one of the interviews I say, there's a very small town, nothing in all of it.

11:08.514 --> 11:12.540
I don't write it down because I can't even spell it.

11:13.221 --> 11:16.545
There's a call in the northern part of Romans.

11:16.565 --> 11:17.266
That's nothing.

11:17.386 --> 11:18.848
I think 50 people are living there.

11:19.300 --> 11:23.766
And I once said, you can live in GTX, where you have to write a book.

11:24.867 --> 11:30.295
You can be sure that a customer someday walks up and says, may I have a look at your books?

11:30.655 --> 11:35.862
And that's true, absolutely.

11:35.882 --> 11:39.687
And when you say it's a very small town, you mean the readership of book people?

11:40.328 --> 11:43.792
First, it's a small town, as a small community.

11:45.495 --> 11:48.058
And second, it is a small world, not a

11:48.443 --> 11:50.506
It is a very small world.

11:50.526 --> 11:52.128
That's one of the reasons.

11:52.148 --> 11:54.131
Never tell fairy tales.

11:57.615 --> 12:00.359
No, that is the most stupid thing you can do.

12:01.861 --> 12:02.722
Never tell lies.

12:02.802 --> 12:04.184
Never tell fairy tales.

12:04.324 --> 12:09.151
Never try to cheat a client.

12:09.171 --> 12:16.240
Not only because of decency, but just because you are out of business.

12:17.283 --> 12:19.085
And your integrity is everything.

12:19.365 --> 12:22.069
And the integrity in this tradition.

12:22.089 --> 12:22.449
Absolutely.

12:22.829 --> 12:33.842
Because once people feel that maybe you misrepresented something, or them, it's never the same.

12:34.082 --> 12:36.025
I've never been the greatest person in the world.

12:36.705 --> 12:43.273
And I've never had the ambition, yes, but not the capabilities.

12:43.996 --> 12:52.108
On the other hand, I've handled a lot of interesting materials, and I've seen a lot of interesting clients.

12:52.208 --> 12:56.094
I've been on friendly terms with many of the great book collectors in the world.

12:57.236 --> 13:06.149
I've been on friendly terms with many of the great librarians in the world, and generally with most of my colleagues.

13:10.856 --> 13:13.260
I don't think that I have

13:14.405 --> 13:18.230
seen a chance to make money in the trade.

13:20.393 --> 13:22.335
Well, they certainly have the highest regard for you.

13:22.375 --> 13:25.039
Everyone has that I've taught.

13:25.159 --> 13:27.682
I'm not afraid of the reason not to.

13:27.802 --> 13:30.125
That's important, isn't it?

13:30.145 --> 13:30.546
That's important.

13:30.906 --> 13:32.528
And then, of course, you've been a publisher.

13:32.989 --> 13:34.471
I've been a publisher.

13:34.491 --> 13:38.355
I had your book, The Making of the Nuremberg Chronicles.

13:38.375 --> 13:39.277
Which is a very fine book.

13:39.297 --> 13:42.741
I met Harry and Wilson both are very nice.

13:43.885 --> 13:51.394
William Wilsman was, he was a photographer, he was a printer, he was a philosopher.

13:51.414 --> 13:52.836
He was a very nice man.

13:52.856 --> 13:53.938
He didn't touch origin.

13:54.058 --> 14:09.437
His parents, even his parents came to your country when he was, well, he was born in a country that they came to, and settled somewhere in the west.

14:09.457 --> 14:13.302
And he was an amazingly nice man, and good.

14:13.906 --> 14:21.703
Trustful, honest in his work, in everything.

14:21.863 --> 14:26.032
And he became very good friends.

14:26.052 --> 14:33.248
I met him through one of the Dutch authorities in this country.

14:35.438 --> 14:38.742
who came to me and said, listen, I know Eileen Wilson.

14:38.762 --> 14:41.324
Eileen Wilson wants to publish for a book.

14:41.344 --> 14:42.666
He's going to talk about the Dutch.

14:42.886 --> 14:44.127
I don't remember my chronicle.

14:45.048 --> 14:46.150
Is there something for you?

14:46.170 --> 14:48.132
I said, yes, of course there's something for me.

14:48.152 --> 14:50.294
And you say that Eileen Wilson is a good man.

14:51.095 --> 14:52.056
I take it for granted.

14:53.257 --> 14:55.740
So he did the layout for the book.

14:56.361 --> 15:00.786
I think altogether it became very interesting.

15:00.866 --> 15:02.087
It's a well produced book.

15:02.270 --> 15:05.495
Well, it's now 20-odd years old, I think, right?

15:05.515 --> 15:06.757
Yeah, about.

15:07.017 --> 15:09.281
I bought it in New York this past April.

15:09.841 --> 15:10.903
I paid a good price for it.

15:11.204 --> 15:11.464
Good.

15:11.965 --> 15:12.946
It's what it looks like.

15:12.966 --> 15:14.308
Yeah, I paid $125 for it.

15:15.490 --> 15:17.593
We sold it for $70.

15:17.814 --> 15:18.935
The book is worth it.

15:19.015 --> 15:20.197
I was thrilled to get it.

15:20.678 --> 15:25.004
And I went into Roger Stoddard from Harvard at the fair, and he says, what have you bought?

15:25.024 --> 15:25.485
I said, this.

15:25.505 --> 15:26.587
He says, great book.

15:27.408 --> 15:30.032
And then he said to me, you've got to go see Nico.

15:30.738 --> 15:32.440
He was here.

15:32.460 --> 15:34.001
I only spoke to him over the telephone.

15:34.021 --> 15:36.303
Yes, I was just out of hospital.

15:36.623 --> 15:37.104
This is here.

15:37.124 --> 15:38.365
He was here early in the summer.

15:38.545 --> 15:41.508
He was now in September.

15:41.608 --> 15:42.008
Oh, he's here?

15:42.048 --> 15:42.469
Here again.

15:42.509 --> 15:47.573
So we don't do business anymore together.

15:48.494 --> 15:51.397
We always have to talk and come to see him.

15:51.417 --> 15:53.859
But in a new age, he says that even better.

15:55.060 --> 15:56.801
Jim Bowles.

15:57.142 --> 15:57.802
Yes.

15:57.822 --> 16:00.745
He was a great man.

16:01.028 --> 16:04.513
He was a good book.

16:04.533 --> 16:06.696
A lot of books have gone to the U.S., haven't they?

16:06.837 --> 16:08.138
European things.

16:09.300 --> 16:12.224
It is a steady flow.

16:12.645 --> 16:16.411
It has been a steady flow.

16:16.431 --> 16:22.119
Last year, it has been turning around slowly.

16:22.580 --> 16:28.909
Because now you have more fluent Europe.

16:29.868 --> 16:30.790
Not only that.

16:30.950 --> 16:41.167
In your brother's office this morning, for instance, they said that they've basically seen the market in American institutions almost dry up.

16:41.768 --> 16:44.433
One of the reasons is they're spending money on computers.

16:44.713 --> 16:45.915
Well, it's the same.

16:45.935 --> 16:46.516
It's terrible.

16:46.536 --> 16:47.818
They're not spending money on books.

16:47.839 --> 16:49.561
It's the same everything.

16:49.581 --> 16:50.303
Is this concerning?

16:50.323 --> 16:50.864
It's a shame.

16:50.884 --> 16:52.026
It's terrible, isn't it?

16:52.046 --> 16:52.747
It is a shame.

16:53.488 --> 16:54.610
You've gone past.

16:55.450 --> 17:05.801
Okay, you can have a modern library like, let's say, university library, college library, with no research into history.

17:05.821 --> 17:07.263
That's fine, no problem.

17:09.125 --> 17:23.601
Then you can do with the regular book, come out every month, every day, and you buy copies, and you know how many copies, because you have 25 students' interest, so you have at least six copies, I don't know, and that's that.

17:23.817 --> 17:24.718
That's fine.

17:24.738 --> 17:38.834
But when you have a library like, traditional library, like Houghton, like Beineken, like Yale, like Roger Shakespeare, New York historical, which is a shame.

17:38.954 --> 17:40.777
I mean, such a beautiful collection.

17:41.517 --> 17:42.699
Being well-known.

17:42.759 --> 17:48.986
That they are trying to earn funds to... But they sold off a lot of the artwork and stuff.

17:49.046 --> 17:51.529
No, no, no.

17:51.813 --> 17:53.295
then it's different.

17:53.355 --> 18:02.144
You have to have funds to buy the old book you think you may need in the future the moment you see it.

18:03.785 --> 18:05.127
And that's all of the same.

18:06.088 --> 18:11.573
You know Ken Carpenter at Harvard?

18:12.474 --> 18:17.099
No, I haven't been to Harvard for a minute.

18:17.379 --> 18:18.140
Nice man.

18:18.260 --> 18:19.782
Bill Bond is a nice man, yeah.

18:19.802 --> 18:21.263
Well, Ken Carpenter is...

18:21.547 --> 18:35.342
He used to be at the business school, library, and now he's in charge of the white... Yes, at the famous collection of... Yes, Crest, I think it's called.

18:35.522 --> 18:37.344
Yes, the Crest collection.

18:37.745 --> 18:39.347
Well, he's now at Harvard.

18:39.367 --> 18:42.630
He decides which books go off storage.

18:44.292 --> 18:47.115
But he was telling me when he was buying books for Crest,

18:47.855 --> 18:52.720
And I said, if you see a book that you think nobody's going to use, do you still buy it?

18:53.781 --> 18:56.144
He said, I bought books that were 18th century.

18:56.164 --> 18:57.765
They were uncut.

18:57.786 --> 19:01.950
And he said, and they might stay uncut for another 200 years.

19:02.290 --> 19:07.276
He said, but my job is to make sure it's there 200 years from now, and that person needs it.

19:07.896 --> 19:09.758
And that's disappearing, isn't it?

19:10.479 --> 19:11.500
That's how you mad too.

19:11.615 --> 19:22.245
But I'm just saying, that attitude about buying the book for the future, and this is what I'm writing about in my new book, that concerns me now.

19:22.365 --> 19:37.960
Yes, I mean, it would be a tremendous loss to the world when libraries, no, not librarians, managers, managing a library, they are no librarians anymore.

19:38.420 --> 19:41.183
I'm studying, I'm writing about that too for the new book.

19:41.635 --> 19:42.396
Amazing.

19:43.117 --> 19:48.265
In the U.S., Columbia, which had the first school of library science, gone.

19:48.805 --> 19:49.186
No more.

19:49.426 --> 19:51.009
They closed it.

19:51.029 --> 19:53.432
Berkeley, now they teach computer sciences.

19:54.634 --> 19:56.156
How to catalog on the computer.

19:56.196 --> 19:57.258
That's interesting stuff.

19:57.458 --> 19:59.160
I think you have to know it.

19:59.201 --> 20:01.424
But nobody's teaching bibliography anymore.

20:02.185 --> 20:04.328
And Berkeley has a good tradition.

20:04.348 --> 20:06.411
Well, it's in trouble there.

20:07.032 --> 20:08.754
So it's a beautiful library.

20:08.814 --> 20:09.414
Beautiful campus.

20:09.594 --> 20:11.076
I was just there two weeks ago.

20:11.096 --> 20:12.096
I spent a week out there.

20:12.136 --> 20:13.297
That's going to be in there.

20:13.518 --> 20:15.640
I'm writing about all of these things in my new book.

20:16.400 --> 20:18.282
About these trends, about the library.

20:18.582 --> 20:23.707
The libraries through history, the libraries of the future, the computers, the printed books.

20:23.727 --> 20:28.171
It's becoming a strange world.

20:29.171 --> 20:36.718
I think that without the book, it will lose what I think and do yourself.

20:37.947 --> 20:46.097
a lot of scholarship.

20:46.778 --> 20:48.841
You can't, I mean, have computers.

20:48.881 --> 20:52.125
Yeah, I use it, and I don't use it now because I don't know how to use it.

20:52.886 --> 20:54.508
But, okay.

20:56.311 --> 20:58.093
But computer only, no books.

21:01.337 --> 21:01.397
No.

21:01.417 --> 21:04.561
The book is there to be there, not to be used.

21:05.863 --> 21:07.465
But like Carpenter said,

21:07.816 --> 21:09.238
day or tomorrow.

21:10.440 --> 21:11.902
Or over a hundred years.

21:12.203 --> 21:13.244
Or two hundred years.

21:13.685 --> 21:14.987
Even though it has to be there.

21:15.047 --> 21:15.788
It has to be there.

21:16.590 --> 21:18.773
I start my new book, I'll tell you the story.

21:19.835 --> 21:22.038
That's why I told the story.

21:23.360 --> 21:24.923
The client is already born.

21:25.864 --> 21:27.907
Sure.

21:27.927 --> 21:36.220
Tell me if it's possible to discuss, because in this new book I'm really interested in this whole concept of book culture.

21:36.790 --> 21:38.712
Does that phrase mean anything to you?

21:38.772 --> 21:40.333
How would you define book culture?

21:40.713 --> 21:42.415
And describe it here in Holland.

21:42.435 --> 21:45.477
Now, you say you're a small country, but it's such an important book.

21:45.517 --> 21:46.738
Holland is an important country.

21:46.758 --> 21:57.908
There's a great history, also in books and in contributions to the book, trade, business, culture, whatever you want.

21:59.169 --> 22:01.671
Great books were published in the country.

22:02.912 --> 22:06.375
Also, great books that couldn't have been published anywhere else.

22:07.503 --> 22:12.511
In the time that Eckhart came to Holland, he didn't come to Holland because Holland was such a nice country.

22:12.972 --> 22:18.000
But he came because he could probably fail in Holland.

22:18.020 --> 22:19.142
That's so important.

22:19.162 --> 22:22.428
That is so important.

22:23.229 --> 22:26.555
And that is why I must say that I live in a good country, yes.

22:27.496 --> 22:28.438
Absolutely.

22:28.838 --> 22:31.603
And even today, like I said,

22:32.528 --> 22:42.141
When you want to establish yourself as a bookseller, you don't need to go to 700 instances before you can establish yourself.

22:42.161 --> 22:44.425
You sit down and have a bookshop and take a test.

22:44.785 --> 22:49.151
Because our... What's that word?

22:50.873 --> 22:54.258
Constitution.

22:54.278 --> 23:01.388
If the free word of the word full freedom,

23:02.161 --> 23:05.766
You see, the word is sacred.

23:05.786 --> 23:07.168
The word is sacred.

23:07.789 --> 23:08.970
The word is sacred.

23:10.132 --> 23:23.490
You see, it reads something like, you can publish whatever you want, you can do whatever you want, as long as you don't libel some.

23:24.030 --> 23:31.881
But that is not the government, the state, who has resided, that the judge, the court,

23:33.802 --> 23:35.584
They are the only one to.

23:37.546 --> 23:40.069
So you have true freedom of the press.

23:40.109 --> 23:41.130
I should know.

23:41.150 --> 23:43.753
Whatever you want.

23:43.854 --> 23:46.036
We have, I must say, the same tradition.

23:46.377 --> 23:47.518
Of course yours is much older.

23:47.758 --> 23:51.482
Tomorrow I'm going up to Leiden, which is a great, great book city.

23:51.603 --> 23:52.023
That is.

23:53.985 --> 23:59.892
I'm going there tomorrow morning and they're going to show the old library there.

24:00.393 --> 24:00.653
Lovely.

24:01.308 --> 24:09.441
Plus it was so important in the book trade as well, not just publication and book selling.

24:09.922 --> 24:10.683
Even today.

24:12.146 --> 24:27.771
Again, not one of the booming publishing towns, but a firm like Burrill and Leiden is there publications for all kinds of obscure countries.

24:29.101 --> 24:38.132
Yeah, or for the Islam, they are the great publisher in the Western world on the Arabic sciences and sorts.

24:38.152 --> 24:46.762
And then they have, and their printing personality, again, because they all become different.

24:46.782 --> 24:56.593
But they were the only people, printers in the world, I think, who could print in college, whatever.

24:57.113 --> 25:02.681
whether it was Sudanese or Ethiopian or whatever.

25:02.701 --> 25:03.582
And why would they do it?

25:03.622 --> 25:05.765
What is the... That was their specialty.

25:06.786 --> 25:11.032
They were at a printing shop and they specialized in this kind of printing.

25:11.052 --> 25:13.235
And doing things that can't be done anyplace else.

25:13.495 --> 25:18.142
And doing things that then couldn't be done anyplace else.

25:18.162 --> 25:19.544
Today it's different.

25:19.564 --> 25:21.246
But they'll still do books.

25:22.428 --> 25:26.293
I think they did a book on Count Libri, a brand new book,

25:26.712 --> 25:27.373
published here.

25:27.773 --> 25:28.173
Oh.

25:28.193 --> 25:28.854
And it's in English.

25:29.515 --> 25:30.696
No, no, that's .

25:31.777 --> 25:36.041
Well, I'm saying, why did they have to come here to publish that book?

25:36.061 --> 25:38.664
That book should have been published in England, should have been published in France.

25:38.904 --> 25:47.993
Well, you don't know, but the Dutch publishing trade has always been a very important one.

25:48.033 --> 25:56.601
I just heard in television or the news today that two Dutch firms published both

25:56.952 --> 26:03.840
scientific material and all kinds of things have now merged.

26:04.621 --> 26:14.432
And they formed together the largest publishing company specialized in scientific books in the world.

26:16.154 --> 26:18.797
At a time when scientific books are in trouble, by the way.

26:19.798 --> 26:20.880
But they say no.

26:21.340 --> 26:23.523
And they do all kinds of things.

26:23.563 --> 26:25.525
They're not only known on the...

26:25.943 --> 26:26.944
Do you know the name of the company?

26:27.926 --> 26:28.968
Elsevier.

26:28.988 --> 26:30.249
Oh, it's Elsevier.

26:30.269 --> 26:31.511
Elsevier together with Clever.

26:34.155 --> 26:34.716
K-L-U-W-E-R.

26:35.157 --> 26:36.619
The Yes Merch today.

26:37.320 --> 26:42.287
But at least the Yes Merch that was publicized today.

26:42.307 --> 26:44.731
Of course, the Elsevier is a famous, famous name.

26:44.751 --> 26:46.474
Oh, that is the same name, not the same name.

26:46.514 --> 26:51.381
Of course, but it goes back many hundreds of years in the 60th century.

26:51.401 --> 26:54.145
Erasmus of Rotterdam, of course.

26:54.682 --> 26:58.886
Well, that, of course, he was a humanist.

26:58.906 --> 27:03.151
That's one of the things, you see, I always do regret.

27:04.332 --> 27:13.621
In London, some years ago, comes up a copy of Erasmus Adagia.

27:14.742 --> 27:17.685
He's famous for proverbs and sayings.

27:17.765 --> 27:18.026
Right.

27:18.786 --> 27:23.271
That runs from many, many editions in history.

27:24.044 --> 27:26.006
He was always working on it.

27:26.026 --> 27:37.259
And in London, a few years ago, comes out a copy of the book in early, I don't know, 11th edition or 10th edition or 9th edition, no matter what.

27:37.279 --> 27:47.371
Full of annotations in the handwriting of the US, or his scholars, or his students, his disciples and acolytes.

27:47.391 --> 27:53.798
Thousands, not a few words, thousands of annotations used

27:54.065 --> 27:57.188
for the next edition.

27:57.208 --> 27:57.588
God.

27:58.349 --> 28:00.451
So I was wild and I read it.

28:01.512 --> 28:06.397
I was already kind of... Excited?

28:06.797 --> 28:10.120
No, not excited, but I was already retiring a little.

28:11.382 --> 28:18.969
And so I called up and said, yes, now comes something new.

28:18.989 --> 28:23.413
In his name, rest of his specialist.

28:24.102 --> 28:27.826
we should try to get the government to buy it.

28:28.887 --> 28:32.850
So he said, yes, but I don't know in this time period.

28:32.870 --> 28:35.433
So I said, OK, try it.

28:35.753 --> 28:45.503
And then I went to the university, and I said, listen, when they do not come to buy it, find some combination that you Dutch ladders can buy the book.

28:46.784 --> 28:53.130
So finally, the Amsterdam ladders came to me and said, listen, we have so much money together.

28:53.245 --> 28:55.969
And do you want to buy the book for us?

28:55.989 --> 28:57.471
I said, no, I'm sorry, I can't.

28:58.211 --> 29:00.995
First, you won't get it at that price.

29:01.055 --> 29:04.359
And second, I have a private party interest.

29:04.380 --> 29:05.281
You have a private, yeah.

29:06.302 --> 29:10.848
Then you come up with a real bit.

29:10.868 --> 29:14.332
It's different, but a bit that has no chance.

29:14.373 --> 29:15.053
Has no chance.

29:15.114 --> 29:16.455
Why should I accept that?

29:17.396 --> 29:18.578
So we gave the bit to Quartz.

29:20.498 --> 29:21.820
And the words was out.

29:22.661 --> 29:23.702
Right away, yeah.

29:24.643 --> 29:31.512
And then I was bidding against the book center from Basel, who was bidding against, oh, who went for the University Library in Basel.

29:32.293 --> 29:39.061
They were just working on the new, complete edition of Erasmus words.

29:39.262 --> 29:39.822
So they got it?

29:40.723 --> 29:44.068
No, because my client, he wanted it.

29:44.588 --> 29:45.890
Oh, this was a private individual.

29:45.930 --> 29:47.272
I was a private individual.

29:47.292 --> 29:49.354
I said, next to me, I said, you're wrong.

29:49.374 --> 29:49.915
And I said,

29:50.030 --> 29:52.314
I told him what he was sitting next to you.

29:52.334 --> 29:54.037
I told him what he was going to fetch.

29:54.057 --> 29:58.425
I said, you wouldn't get it under so many pounds.

30:00.870 --> 30:03.535
So that was about the limit paid.

30:04.196 --> 30:07.282
I would have gone on in this case because that's the thing.

30:07.302 --> 30:09.085
And he, graciously,

30:09.436 --> 30:20.089
gave it to, not to represent it, but made it available to the scholars in Basel University to study it for the annual edition.

30:20.269 --> 30:23.112
Where was this auction?

30:23.393 --> 30:23.994
In London.

30:24.094 --> 30:25.676
How long ago?

30:26.076 --> 30:28.379
I don't know, something like that.

30:28.719 --> 30:32.464
Do you remember, just tell me again what the title of the book was, the Erasmus?

30:32.484 --> 30:33.785
Erasmus?

30:33.805 --> 30:33.885
Yes.

30:33.905 --> 30:39.392
Erasmus, Adagia, A-D-A, G-I-A,

30:40.283 --> 30:53.038
I'll check the auction record on it.

30:53.999 --> 30:57.984
It's a very wealthy country.

30:58.004 --> 31:08.957
I think the guts... That's not a lot of money for a national treasure.

31:09.713 --> 31:13.038
which they say it should have, and they don't have.

31:13.819 --> 31:25.776
Listen, it's one of the very few great humanists from the early 16th century, Erasmus.

31:28.680 --> 31:36.852
And we don't have much manuscript material in his hand in this country, needing nothing.

31:37.203 --> 31:38.925
This was in his hand, too, you think?

31:39.145 --> 31:42.329
For greater part, in his hands, or at the front.

31:42.389 --> 31:46.534
It was a copy that must have been on his desk.

31:47.515 --> 31:55.023
And everybody, anybody who came with some new analogy... Rick wrote it in a nail.

31:55.424 --> 32:06.957
This is so important to me because I'm doing a chapter on books that are important as artifacts, that have been read and that you can determine, like Coleridge's annotated books,

32:07.426 --> 32:11.592
You know, this is of extraordinary interest.

32:11.672 --> 32:13.214
It is, absolutely.

32:13.234 --> 32:16.539
And I'll check the, I'll find it.

32:16.659 --> 32:17.400
Don't worry about it.

32:17.461 --> 32:21.887
I can find it by checking auction records.

32:21.907 --> 32:22.989
Of course it is.

32:23.009 --> 32:29.218
And it's, I don't know, it's a 15, 23 edition.

32:29.939 --> 32:30.540
15, 20, 23?

32:30.580 --> 32:33.864
That's actually like 400, 700 pounds.

32:33.884 --> 32:34.345
Something like that.

32:35.776 --> 32:38.860
And your client was a private... He was a private man.

32:38.880 --> 32:40.943
And what will he do with it at some point, do you think?

32:41.083 --> 32:42.204
He has a lot of money.

32:42.225 --> 32:43.546
Yes, after books as well.

32:44.367 --> 32:46.430
Maybe, will he sell it or give it away?

32:46.450 --> 32:47.311
I don't know.

32:47.331 --> 32:49.334
That's his decision.

32:49.354 --> 32:51.777
His privilege he can do is to save property.

32:51.837 --> 32:52.578
Of course, of course.

32:52.618 --> 32:53.680
And I respect that.

32:53.740 --> 32:57.565
I'm just wondering at some point... Well, you can't say.

32:57.585 --> 33:01.210
I mean, nobody knows before about that.

33:01.450 --> 33:03.032
I never believed that...

33:04.328 --> 33:08.174
Gaskell Nolan's collection would come up for sale.

33:08.194 --> 33:10.317
So there's some, no doubt.

33:10.637 --> 33:11.539
Read my book, though.

33:11.959 --> 33:15.584
He says it, he says in there, I'm going to let my heirs decide.

33:16.346 --> 33:23.496
He says, and I'm sure they looked at the inheritance tax on that and said, sell it, you know.

33:23.837 --> 33:27.141
It's too bad, because, and plus they did that beautiful catalog.

33:28.243 --> 33:31.508
And I think that's what he wanted out of it, was a catalog.

33:31.568 --> 33:33.711
Well, that was, and you must say, it is not true.

33:34.147 --> 33:37.652
Much grandeur and respect.

33:37.813 --> 33:38.333
Absolutely.

33:39.495 --> 33:40.577
Beautiful capital.

33:41.939 --> 33:43.902
So Christie's is going to do it in three parts.

33:44.663 --> 33:47.828
I'll go to the sale.

33:47.968 --> 33:49.290
Book department.

33:50.031 --> 33:50.852
Very old friend.

33:51.153 --> 33:52.615
Well, Massey's gone now, you know.

33:52.895 --> 33:54.338
No, he's not gone.

33:54.578 --> 33:56.481
He was here as well.

33:58.344 --> 34:00.247
I couldn't meet the people.

34:00.507 --> 34:02.550
That's exactly what my really good friends.

34:03.745 --> 34:09.111
like the Krauses and Honey Krauses, the woman.

34:09.131 --> 34:11.713
Anne-Marie told me, really urged me to see you.

34:11.834 --> 34:17.459
Ah sure, Anne-Marie was here, Mary-Anne was here, together with Roland.

34:17.640 --> 34:19.361
I met Mary-Anne, I'm sorry.

34:19.381 --> 34:29.432
Mary-Anne, and the mother was here, but Honey is a woman I really adore, great woman, married to a great bookman.

34:29.632 --> 34:34.479
Let nobody ever tell you that Dr. Peter Krauss was not a great bookman, but he always asked for a money.

34:34.819 --> 34:35.360
He wasn't.

34:36.302 --> 34:42.991
You know, I just saw Tenchert the other day, and people have their attitudes on him, but he's interesting.

34:43.011 --> 34:44.193
That's why they wanted to talk to him.

34:46.176 --> 34:55.990
And he said that when Krauss was very sick, they would still bring him to his place and carry him in, literally, and he was buying books.

34:56.070 --> 34:57.512
He was active to the very end.

34:57.560 --> 35:00.083
He was a devoted bookman.

35:00.103 --> 35:00.464
He was.

35:00.824 --> 35:02.126
He did great things.

35:02.607 --> 35:04.609
He didn't just happen to arrive.

35:04.690 --> 35:05.871
People like to tell him.

35:05.891 --> 35:06.632
He had courage.

35:06.913 --> 35:07.994
He had knowledge.

35:08.395 --> 35:10.117
He had feelings.

35:10.958 --> 35:12.780
He was influenced.

35:12.841 --> 35:20.731
But I know him many, many years, and I think it was one of my first clients.

35:21.793 --> 35:25.137
I don't know if I remember the first thing I've shown them.

35:26.467 --> 35:40.203
He was helpful to you in the beginning when you were getting started?

35:40.283 --> 35:40.443
No.

35:45.449 --> 35:49.594
But I always respected him.

35:49.714 --> 35:50.535
And he knew his stuff.

35:51.135 --> 35:56.001
He generated a lot of resentment.

35:56.808 --> 35:57.970
But that happens.

35:57.990 --> 36:04.098
Because he was a kind of aerogenics, he was a kind of, well, he could be very inquirited.

36:05.040 --> 36:10.087
He was, no, no, he was in... I had one of my great friends in the trade.

36:10.948 --> 36:15.775
He was a man from A, Elton.

36:15.815 --> 36:16.716
That's it.

36:17.057 --> 36:19.601
We worked together.

36:19.621 --> 36:25.549
Not... And...

36:26.238 --> 36:36.490
Hans Krauss, in a way, he enjoyed when we were there.

36:37.391 --> 36:45.461
He said, Sunday he said to us, the good thing with you when you come is, at least we can talk books, you know.

36:48.344 --> 36:51.228
He had some dealings with Haven or more too.

36:51.308 --> 36:52.650
They sold him the Shakespeare's.

36:53.451 --> 36:55.553
Shakespeare's.

36:56.157 --> 37:09.796
And it was, I think it was, no, it was not Folter, it was Karabian, I think, Karabian, you know what I mean?

37:09.957 --> 37:10.417
Sure, Karabian.

37:10.658 --> 37:12.500
He's the one that brought the books up to Cambridge.

37:13.722 --> 37:17.527
Brought them to Haven O'Moore's house, and Haven O'Moore wouldn't even let him come in.

37:17.848 --> 37:19.610
Wouldn't even invite him in for a glass of water.

37:20.852 --> 37:22.094
He asked if he could use the bathroom.

37:22.114 --> 37:23.876
He said there was a gas station down in the corner.

37:24.417 --> 37:25.118
Can you believe that?

37:25.874 --> 37:28.898
I talked to him a couple of years ago.

37:28.918 --> 37:29.719
He was still alive?

37:30.580 --> 37:32.863
He was still alive two years ago when I talked to him.

37:32.883 --> 37:33.884
He can't be all that at all.

37:34.084 --> 37:35.546
He must be in his 80s.

37:35.566 --> 37:36.167
He retired.

37:36.527 --> 37:40.232
Are you still working?

37:42.234 --> 37:44.177
Yes, down in Delaware.

37:44.217 --> 37:47.621
Yourself, are you retired now from the business?

37:48.502 --> 37:50.104
Well, I sold my business.

37:50.625 --> 37:54.970
Did he miss it?

37:56.131 --> 37:56.872
Yes and no.

37:58.815 --> 38:01.839
I'm doing a tremendous job in the book.

38:03.382 --> 38:14.337
Some of the great art libraries asked me to evaluate the old books in their old books.

38:14.357 --> 38:22.970
So I'm working already since June last year to evaluate something I cannot find in some old books.

38:24.893 --> 38:25.834
So that keeps you active?

38:26.168 --> 38:28.613
And that took me, at least it took me up the street.

38:29.634 --> 38:32.379
I did it before I got this heart problem.

38:32.400 --> 38:40.034
About four days a week, every morning I went in, and I answered him out, and then I went left at 1 o'clock.

38:40.535 --> 38:41.857
So you set your own schedule?

38:41.877 --> 38:46.185
And that was beautiful, and then I reported every month, and...

38:49.540 --> 38:55.807
You've had quite an interest... Now, this must be all reference material over here from... Well, it is not old.

38:56.147 --> 39:02.875
No, I have... That is most, but then I have a university library.

39:02.895 --> 39:04.096
I have the greatest collection.

39:04.137 --> 39:04.517
What?

39:05.338 --> 39:06.639
What's in front of you?

39:06.679 --> 39:07.360
Your library?

39:07.460 --> 39:09.683
No, the university library in Amsterdam.

39:09.703 --> 39:11.044
Oh, that's your reference library.

39:11.064 --> 39:13.948
Oh, that's fantastic.

39:13.968 --> 39:17.051
And I have free access to it.

39:17.071 --> 39:17.792
And it's close?

39:18.329 --> 39:23.954
Yeah, but I mean, I'm teasing.

39:23.994 --> 39:25.536
So you would go over there to do your work.

39:25.576 --> 39:27.198
That's very interesting.

39:29.099 --> 39:32.002
They're fantastic.

39:32.022 --> 39:38.408
They have one of the great books out of the 19th century, this country was a man called Muller, Frederick Muller.

39:39.810 --> 39:40.390
He was German.

39:40.511 --> 39:46.176
He came to Holland in the 1830s, 1840s.

39:47.776 --> 39:51.181
established himself as a bookseller, became one of the great booksellers of the period.

39:53.183 --> 39:58.371
He did a lot of good catalogs, specialised in many other things.

39:58.391 --> 40:13.952
Americana, he was one of the great suppliers for, let's say, Carter Brown, George, all the great collectors in the land in the other days.

40:14.287 --> 40:31.124
He found that he had the idea when we, and we wanted to be knowledgeable, wanted to be capable of informing our clients, we have to have the books.

40:32.085 --> 40:39.012
And he was instrumental in forming the first library devoted

40:39.262 --> 40:41.986
to bibliography at... Mrs. Muller?

40:42.566 --> 40:44.028
Mr. Muller, yes.

40:44.048 --> 40:44.569
M-U-L-L-E-R.

40:44.589 --> 40:45.150
No.

40:45.170 --> 40:45.530
Frederick.

40:45.951 --> 40:47.793
Frederick Muller.

40:47.813 --> 40:48.514
And did you know him?

40:49.075 --> 40:49.235
No.

40:49.295 --> 40:49.936
He died.

40:50.056 --> 40:51.698
Oh, he died?

40:51.778 --> 40:52.319
He died.

40:52.760 --> 40:53.501
I don't know.

40:53.601 --> 40:55.703
Maybe something like that.

40:55.724 --> 40:56.885
No, no, I didn't.

40:56.945 --> 40:57.506
Okay, obviously.

40:57.866 --> 40:59.909
I'm not ashamed to tell you I didn't know.

41:00.169 --> 41:00.790
No, no, I'm sorry.

41:00.810 --> 41:02.332
I get lost there on the dates.

41:02.412 --> 41:02.653
No, no.

41:03.253 --> 41:04.315
But he was a bookseller.

41:04.615 --> 41:05.697
He was a great bookseller.

41:05.717 --> 41:06.838
And he persuaded...

41:07.831 --> 41:09.053
It's interesting, again.

41:09.113 --> 41:19.126
Not only persuaded, but he contributed in a big way, money-wise and book-wise, to the form of this library.

41:19.187 --> 41:25.655
Another one then was Nyhoff, a firm still-existing, but no rare book department anymore.

41:26.577 --> 41:27.538
Mathias Nyhoff.

41:28.659 --> 41:31.323
And those were great times.

41:31.363 --> 41:35.929
And then it was taken over by the Dutch Books House Association.

41:35.949 --> 41:36.370
No.

41:37.042 --> 42:06.711
was taken over which was taken elaborate the library so where is that what's the name of the library the library of the Dutch book sounds association it's now incorporated in the Dutch and there is a tremendous collection and they all died and have a book as well I don't think they're not present in the Netherlands

42:07.602 --> 42:11.387
My book had a very fine review on the Netherlands, by the way.

42:12.909 --> 42:13.751
It had a full page.

42:14.051 --> 42:17.576
No, I have it at home.

42:17.596 --> 42:18.818
They sent it to me.

42:18.838 --> 42:33.879
And then they did a television documentary, and two of the people in my book, the black man, Charles Blockson, and the Jewish fellow, Aaron Lansky, who saves the Yiddish books, they called me, I arranged, they gave me a credit on the film.

42:33.899 --> 42:36.422
And it was on Dutch national television.

42:36.582 --> 42:37.103
I didn't know that.

42:37.336 --> 42:39.520
Yeah, and they sent me a copy, but I was so very proud.

42:39.540 --> 42:43.246
I saw that you were reading paper for the Grosje Club.

42:43.987 --> 42:48.234
Two weeks and one of the Grosje Club.

42:48.274 --> 42:53.984
I love the Grosje Club, it's very... Yeah, but I don't use it, I mean... It's good for me.

42:54.024 --> 42:56.989
Of course, it's good for anybody, because they have a good library.

42:57.009 --> 43:03.580
They have a wonderful library, and the people I meet are very...

43:04.032 --> 43:04.833
helpful to me.

43:04.933 --> 43:07.176
I remember six and five.

43:07.196 --> 43:12.843
Yeah, I mean, I only go down once or twice a year, but it's still worth whatever it costs me, you know.

43:13.003 --> 43:17.689
But since I don't struggle much anymore.

43:17.769 --> 43:28.103
I used to go one, twice, three times every year to the United States or more.

43:28.123 --> 43:30.526
Most of your business was outside of Holland, would you say?

43:30.666 --> 43:30.946
Yes.

43:31.607 --> 43:33.229
I have also elected position.

43:33.614 --> 43:43.964
a position, that I had very good Dutch clients, institutional and non-institutional.

43:43.984 --> 43:58.538
Like the University Libraries, like the some of the University Libraries, like the Martime Museums, I showed a lot of Martime Museums here, other such maps, that kind of thing.

43:58.558 --> 44:00.820
I've been quite good in time.

44:01.272 --> 44:14.747
That story you just told me a few minutes ago about the Erasmus, and you were representing a collector.

44:14.767 --> 44:17.590
That was quite a responsible thing.

44:18.811 --> 44:26.520
On the one hand, you have a customer, but you said to the university, look, this is a matter of national importance.

44:26.888 --> 44:29.931
You're basically going against yourself there in a way, weren't you?

44:29.951 --> 44:31.693
You're saying you should be getting this book.

44:31.913 --> 44:32.273
Absolutely.

44:32.293 --> 44:33.474
I want to alert you to this.

44:34.035 --> 44:37.658
Well, I would have told my client they wouldn't have listened to me.

44:37.678 --> 44:40.381
And they would have taken another... Another agent.

44:40.521 --> 44:41.122
Other agent.

44:41.442 --> 44:46.066
And I would have told them, listen, take your hands off the book.

44:47.067 --> 44:54.094
I think it's something that belongs to the Netherlands and not particularly to you.

44:55.255 --> 44:56.516
You would have told them that?

44:56.657 --> 44:57.557
I would have told them that.

44:57.878 --> 44:59.379
He would have voted.

44:59.880 --> 45:00.761
He still would have bought it.

45:01.181 --> 45:01.722
I think so.

45:02.142 --> 45:04.585
He is a persistent client, yes.

45:04.605 --> 45:07.368
And he wants something, he wants something.

45:07.388 --> 45:07.949
And he's right.

45:08.409 --> 45:09.010
Then he should be.

45:09.631 --> 45:12.754
But your position is, your country came first.

45:13.174 --> 45:13.595
My country?

45:13.615 --> 45:14.476
No, not my country.

45:14.496 --> 45:23.085
Not the country, but... Yes, I think that this was the opportunity for the Dutch government to buy the only great Erasmus Heiden.

45:23.977 --> 45:25.839
still can be expected to come for sale.

45:27.300 --> 45:28.021
And they declined.

45:29.502 --> 45:30.062
They declined.

45:30.142 --> 45:32.224
And that bothers me.

45:32.264 --> 45:33.125
It bothers me.

45:33.385 --> 45:35.187
And we see it happen all the time, you know.

45:35.207 --> 45:38.810
I mean, Winston Churchill's books are circulating, you know.

45:40.111 --> 45:41.332
Why did that happen?

45:41.352 --> 45:43.614
Shouldn't his books have been... He was a great reader.

45:43.694 --> 45:45.356
He was a winner of the Nobel Prize.

45:45.476 --> 45:49.079
I mean, his library should have stayed together, it seems to me.

45:49.119 --> 45:50.040
Don't you think so?

45:50.440 --> 45:52.482
Well, that's getting...

45:52.630 --> 45:55.153
And thus everything had to stay together.

45:56.014 --> 45:58.617
But I think when, after how long?

45:58.637 --> 46:07.108
450 years, the opportunity comes for the government to buy a thing like that.

46:07.929 --> 46:09.110
They should hesitate.

46:09.130 --> 46:11.333
They should embrace me.

46:11.933 --> 46:13.796
Thank you for bringing it to Robert's notice.

46:15.277 --> 46:15.958
But it was the money.

46:17.120 --> 46:20.764
And how much were they willing to spend, just out of curiosity?

46:21.115 --> 46:33.729
They were willing to spend, and then they had a grant of one of the Dutch collectors, of, I don't know, I think half of the money, something like 900,000 euros, which was then $500,000.

46:34.110 --> 46:37.814
And it finally went for about $700,000, you said, right?

46:38.315 --> 46:41.378
It went for, yes, something like that.

46:41.398 --> 46:42.499
So it wasn't even close?

46:43.621 --> 46:44.261
No, they weren't.

46:44.422 --> 46:50.008
I mean, when they told me we had 900,000 euros to spend, I said, thank you very much, I won't get it.

46:51.119 --> 46:52.121
What was the estimate?

46:52.141 --> 46:54.506
Do you remember what they were doing?

46:54.526 --> 46:54.987
I'm not sure.

46:55.007 --> 46:58.433
I think in dollars, two, three hundred.

46:59.235 --> 47:02.080
So they barely came in at the estimate then?

47:02.181 --> 47:04.666
Just over... So that's never... They were brave.

47:05.247 --> 47:09.836
That's never... And I told them, you're not brave, you won't get it.

47:09.856 --> 47:10.116
No.

47:11.399 --> 47:13.583
Listen, that is...

47:14.170 --> 47:15.211
It doesn't make sense.

47:15.231 --> 47:17.654
No, you're giving them advice.

47:18.154 --> 47:20.237
They asked my advice, sorry.

47:20.257 --> 47:23.300
And you're saying, listen, I've been in this business all my life, I'm telling you.

47:24.001 --> 47:24.562
You won't get it.

47:24.602 --> 47:25.182
You won't get it.

47:26.864 --> 47:28.206
They should have just had an open ticket.

47:28.786 --> 47:29.667
I mean, they can afford it.

47:30.188 --> 47:33.932
At least in the States of the Netherlands.

47:34.112 --> 47:37.596
The States of the Netherlands must be capable of making

47:38.015 --> 47:42.401
I say, one million dollars extra to buy... One way or another.

47:42.641 --> 47:43.222
To buy a great thing.

47:43.242 --> 47:47.028
They buy paintings for, I don't know, five, eight, ten million dollars.

47:47.048 --> 47:48.810
That's the most amazing thing there.

47:48.830 --> 47:51.774
And then they buy the wrong ones as well, because the good ones are already here.

47:55.279 --> 47:55.860
I love that.

47:56.962 --> 47:59.065
Listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.

47:59.605 --> 48:05.794
Oh, I'm not... If you get tired or anything, just let me know.

48:06.466 --> 48:11.350
But I think that I have spoken enough, so then you have some questions to ask us.

48:12.011 --> 48:19.558
So I'm just delighted that... Because it's, of course, like always with me, it's a mishmash of all kinds of things.

48:20.759 --> 48:22.741
But, like, my book is a mishmash of things.

48:23.502 --> 48:25.924
I love a lot of different things.

48:25.964 --> 48:32.089
And this book is... You've touched on ten different subjects that I'm interested in.

48:32.230 --> 48:33.891
So ask me things, then I shall...

48:34.242 --> 48:37.245
tried to... Who were some of the great collectors that you knew?

48:37.365 --> 48:42.551
I mean, and I don't want to talk about customers that, you know... Well, in this country or everywhere.

48:43.152 --> 48:43.492
Anywhere, yeah.

48:43.512 --> 48:57.888
Well, I knew all the fun, but I knew many of the great collectors, people like Henry Taylor, people like Tom Streeter, people like... Well, what would Streeter buy?

48:57.908 --> 48:58.869
He was Americana.

48:59.370 --> 49:00.631
But I was Americana.

49:00.651 --> 49:01.813
You were Americana, too?

49:01.953 --> 49:03.034
Oh, sure.

49:03.892 --> 49:07.276
until my last move, you know.

49:07.296 --> 49:12.261
Explain how you became expert in that area, over here.

49:12.861 --> 49:15.644
How is it that you became... Well, I don't know.

49:15.864 --> 49:17.186
But I was an expert.

49:17.206 --> 49:22.912
Yeah, still am I. I know the... I know Americana.

49:22.932 --> 49:27.937
Of course, when we talk about Americana, we're talking about exploration, we're talking about... Oh, yeah.

49:27.957 --> 49:28.537
That's one I can't believe.

49:28.558 --> 49:30.580
And we're talking about charts.

49:30.940 --> 49:31.941
Echoing to see...

49:32.596 --> 49:34.078
He took exploration.

49:34.279 --> 49:34.860
Who did?

49:34.880 --> 49:35.541
Echo.

49:35.561 --> 49:36.102
Oh, really?

49:36.863 --> 49:37.684
Umberto Ethel?

49:37.704 --> 49:39.127
Umberto Ethel.

49:39.147 --> 49:39.768
I'm seeing him.

49:39.788 --> 49:45.858
But he didn't buy... He bought my facsimile editions.

49:48.703 --> 49:50.365
He bought the facsimiles.

49:50.385 --> 49:51.848
Was this while he was writing the novel?

49:52.389 --> 49:52.569
No.

49:53.551 --> 49:54.352
But that's interesting.

49:54.372 --> 49:54.933
He came here.

49:55.414 --> 49:56.275
What did you think of him?

49:57.706 --> 50:03.892
I don't know, my Italian is not great, he's not so perfect.

50:03.912 --> 50:06.594
He was together with the Dutch also.

50:07.235 --> 50:10.618
And he came absolutely unexpected.

50:10.638 --> 50:11.438
He just dropped in?

50:11.859 --> 50:16.843
He just dropped in and then somebody said to me, they mentioned a name, I'm not good in names anyhow.

50:16.863 --> 50:18.865
I'm not good in faces, I'm not good in names.

50:20.006 --> 50:25.671
And I didn't realize who the man was.

50:26.798 --> 50:30.803
So the first, later it became more.

50:30.823 --> 50:31.143
Yeah.

50:31.283 --> 50:35.148
Well, he's a very famous author in that.

50:35.168 --> 50:39.593
I'm interested in him because of his interest in so many different aspects of books.

50:40.114 --> 50:43.258
He came to see the collection of Ritman.

50:43.498 --> 50:45.400
I don't know whether that's a collection of Ritman.

50:45.420 --> 50:53.009
He is one of the few Dutch collectors of importance of the last pre-war years, post-war years.

50:54.251 --> 50:55.472
And he collects a very

50:55.688 --> 51:05.038
a special subject.

51:05.799 --> 51:07.120
Alchemy?

51:07.420 --> 51:07.841
Alchemy.

51:08.021 --> 51:09.282
Alchemy, anything like that.

51:12.325 --> 51:17.551
He got himself in trouble because of his lab.

51:17.571 --> 51:19.473
He got himself in trouble?

51:19.493 --> 51:24.278
To go over

51:26.738 --> 51:28.480
You didn't spend too much money on the books?

51:30.824 --> 51:31.324
It happens.

51:33.347 --> 51:34.969
Did he keep the books?

51:35.590 --> 51:43.000
Or did he lose the books?

51:44.402 --> 51:45.704
Well, I've covered a lot.

51:45.924 --> 51:53.775
If you think there's anything that I've missed... I know, I know.

51:54.498 --> 51:57.623
I'm like you, I talk too much.

51:57.643 --> 51:58.064
I'm sorry?

51:58.565 --> 51:59.847
I'm like you, I talk too much.

51:59.907 --> 52:01.269
No, no, I talk too much.

52:01.309 --> 52:03.272
That's my problem.

52:07.059 --> 52:09.222
I love the stories, though, I have to say.

52:10.524 --> 52:11.646
What was the greatest

52:12.503 --> 52:13.904
What's your greatest book experience?

52:13.924 --> 52:16.447
Can you think of what your greatest, the most satisfying?

52:16.567 --> 52:19.350
I must say the most satisfying lie was the answer.

52:19.450 --> 52:26.136
I think that was the greatest item anybody, any bookseller could expect.

52:26.156 --> 52:26.477
Really?

52:26.977 --> 52:27.658
Absolutely.

52:29.480 --> 52:42.072
I mean, given always that this is not worldwide, otherwise America would have been moved, I think they weren't.

52:43.081 --> 52:58.902
So, it is... Erasmus was one of the really great thinkers of the important period of moving around everything that existed.

52:58.922 --> 53:01.525
Religion and science and whatever.

53:01.905 --> 53:03.988
He's the first professional writer too.

53:04.048 --> 53:05.891
And he was there.

53:05.951 --> 53:07.533
He was part of it.

53:07.553 --> 53:09.195
And then you can buy a book like that.

53:11.137 --> 53:12.379
That his thoughts are...

53:12.747 --> 53:15.309
in the present time, and a unique copy.

53:15.409 --> 53:30.543
No, another thing I've always pleased, very pleased, but they are all not compared to, let's say, the great manuscripts that I've spoken in the place, or nothing, but it pleases me.

53:32.024 --> 53:37.329
I wrote completely unexpected.

53:39.431 --> 53:42.754
A manuscript, a Spanish manuscript,

53:43.561 --> 53:48.748
the original binding, but the original binding has something that is hardly known to exist.

53:48.768 --> 53:56.358
It's known to have existed, but from paintings, particularly Flemish paintings they show.

53:56.939 --> 54:06.312
They are manuscripts, prayer books, in kind of silk,

54:07.591 --> 54:14.920
They call it chimise.

54:16.522 --> 54:21.167
And that was, I think, one of the great things I handled, yes.

54:21.327 --> 54:22.609
And how long ago was this?

54:22.629 --> 54:23.930
Seven years.

54:24.491 --> 54:25.833
Really, so recent.

54:26.493 --> 54:27.615
And this again was at auction?

54:28.075 --> 54:34.543
No, I bought it from a company, because it's so pure.

54:34.878 --> 54:36.701
An unknown, you said it was unknown?

54:36.741 --> 54:37.101
Completely.

54:37.121 --> 54:38.002
It came out of the blue.

54:38.683 --> 54:39.485
Where did it come from?

54:39.505 --> 54:41.187
A private collection or a home?

54:41.207 --> 54:42.028
A private collection.

54:42.769 --> 54:51.882
The thing was that I was never knew and never recognized to be one of the great manuscript specialists.

54:53.204 --> 54:57.811
But some day we were in London for some book fair, I think it was.

54:57.911 --> 55:03.619
I was sitting at a hotel lounge and we just ordered an English tea.

55:04.308 --> 55:06.130
complete with them.

55:06.150 --> 55:09.494
There on Sunday afternoon, and in walks, and quality, I know, many days.

55:09.894 --> 55:12.116
Always been good friends.

55:13.017 --> 55:15.460
And so I said, come on, sit down and have a tea.

55:15.780 --> 55:17.302
So we sat down and had a tea.

55:19.184 --> 55:28.514
And then, we were talking short, and he said, I got something, I know you're not interested.

55:28.534 --> 55:33.960
And it's so fantastic, and he told the story, he said, who told you I'm not interested?

55:34.970 --> 55:38.195
I said, Adrian, why don't I show it to you?

55:38.215 --> 55:39.337
I said, of course, come on.

55:40.198 --> 55:41.921
You had your interest.

55:41.941 --> 55:43.804
You had your attention.

55:43.824 --> 55:44.465
Let's see it.

55:44.525 --> 55:46.609
Let's see it.

55:46.629 --> 55:48.972
So I said, you have a prize?

55:48.993 --> 55:58.648
They said, I can't tell you the prize I can't sell it to you because I gave somebody 24 hours until tomorrow night.

55:58.932 --> 56:01.935
Monday night, the right of first refusal.

56:02.456 --> 56:04.659
Mr. Fenton doesn't buy it.

56:04.679 --> 56:10.045
I know your price, and I shall say no then, but probably I say yes.

56:11.667 --> 56:17.694
So, through the morning, he calls me up in my room and says, I'm free.

56:18.295 --> 56:18.635
Are you?

56:18.655 --> 56:19.636
I said yes or not.

56:20.337 --> 56:21.759
It means the price, yes.

56:22.600 --> 56:26.945
Can you describe it a little more for me?

56:26.965 --> 56:28.146
Did you open the Royal Library?

56:28.598 --> 56:29.419
I'm sorry?

56:29.919 --> 56:35.365
I'm not going to have time, it's true.

56:37.467 --> 56:45.435
It is a Spanish manuscript for the Italian market.

56:45.455 --> 56:48.018
You know that there was an information in Spain.

56:48.498 --> 56:53.003
Yes.

56:54.215 --> 57:00.504
some good miniatures, manuscript of some standing, if you want, some jewelry.

57:02.266 --> 57:19.451
In the original leather binding, stamped leather binding, new, and over leather binding, this chemise in the most beautiful red silk.

57:20.592 --> 57:21.654
In a beautiful condition.

57:23.036 --> 57:23.817
In a beautiful condition.

57:24.303 --> 57:25.244
At 1450, 16.

57:25.324 --> 57:28.068
1450, 16.

57:28.088 --> 57:28.629
1450, 16.

57:28.649 --> 57:31.833
1460, I think.

57:33.095 --> 57:36.479
At Mount Royal Labyrinth, eh?

57:36.499 --> 57:37.721
How many of these?

57:37.941 --> 57:39.303
Do you remember how big it was?

57:39.363 --> 57:40.505
No, it also didn't.

57:40.625 --> 57:44.189
It was very, very precise manuscript of this.

57:44.590 --> 57:49.857
So did you buy it and then sell it to the Royal Labyrinth?

57:49.877 --> 57:51.539
I didn't sell it to the Royal Labyrinth.

57:51.559 --> 57:52.200
They bought it.

57:53.986 --> 58:03.777
I went to see the manuscript department, because I couldn't decide whether the manuscript was Italian or Spanish.

58:04.117 --> 58:05.739
I decided to ask for Spanish.

58:06.339 --> 58:11.865
So I went to see the curator of manuscripts in the library.

58:11.885 --> 58:16.971
And then she saw the combination.

58:18.733 --> 58:22.677
So she said, we should show that to the

58:22.910 --> 58:27.536
to our binding specialist.

58:27.556 --> 58:28.517
Specialist for bindings.

58:28.998 --> 58:35.626
Well, she said, he is not here, he is in the museum.

58:35.727 --> 58:41.634
I said, okay, let's go down and see him.

58:43.457 --> 58:49.204
And he was rather kind of annoyed to see me there because he was doing some work.

58:49.387 --> 58:51.990
and had taken off some hours from the library to do the work.

58:52.010 --> 58:54.812
This is up at the Hague now, the Book Museum of the Hague?

58:54.932 --> 58:56.334
No, it is in the Royal Library.

58:56.354 --> 59:00.198
They are not... The Royal Library here?

59:00.898 --> 59:03.200
The Royal Library in the Hague.

59:03.621 --> 59:03.941
Yes.

59:04.081 --> 59:05.242
I want to be here tomorrow.

59:05.262 --> 59:07.945
Maybe I'll have time to take a look.

59:07.965 --> 59:13.530
Then, I said, no, she said, we are not coming from us.

59:13.571 --> 59:14.732
We want to show you something.

59:15.132 --> 59:18.195
I said, I didn't want to show you, I don't want to show you anything.

59:19.424 --> 59:26.611
She said, I should go and we should go and show you the thing.

59:27.211 --> 59:28.993
And so I said, okay, but do you have?

59:29.013 --> 59:32.737
So I showed it to him and he said, come on.

59:33.337 --> 59:36.300
Yeah, absolutely.

59:36.320 --> 59:37.061
And then nothing.

59:37.221 --> 59:40.003
I said, he never had mentioned twice.

59:40.484 --> 59:47.671
Then some week later, 10 days later, he called me and I said, Nico, what do you want?

59:47.691 --> 59:49.212
I said, what do you mean you have to do?

59:51.487 --> 59:54.390
I think I can get money available to buy it.

59:54.410 --> 59:59.335
So I mentioned my price, and two weeks later he said, yes, we're going to buy it.

59:59.756 --> 01:00:01.117
So you had bought it yourself?

01:00:01.678 --> 01:00:02.178
Of course.

01:00:02.278 --> 01:00:07.644
I'm happy to have a deal with books that I had on commission.

01:00:07.664 --> 01:00:09.226
So this was already yours?

01:00:09.506 --> 01:00:11.568
Sure.

01:00:11.588 --> 01:00:14.351
And you weren't in any great rush to sell it anywhere either?

01:00:14.631 --> 01:00:15.192
No, why?

01:00:15.312 --> 01:00:21.038
I mean, something you never... The problem was that at a certain moment, again, there's always problems.

01:00:22.148 --> 01:00:36.896
that the board of directors of the Royal Library, they decided that before buying it, because the manuscript was not worth the money, the silver was not worth the money, the combination was worth the money.

01:00:36.916 --> 01:00:40.984
So was the binding and the manuscript and the illuminations?
