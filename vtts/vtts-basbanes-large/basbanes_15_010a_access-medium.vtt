WEBVTT

00:02.663 --> 00:05.086
Okay, I'll put the sweater on for that.

00:05.106 --> 00:06.607
Chatting with Mark Brown.

00:06.647 --> 00:07.488
Congratulations.

00:08.089 --> 00:16.838
I guess the TV, this is not a Saturday, quite pointedly, is not a Saturday morning show, right?

00:16.878 --> 00:17.579
No, it isn't.

00:18.540 --> 00:19.241
It could have been.

00:19.261 --> 00:26.108
I was approached by the networks to do Arthur on Saturday morning, but it didn't seem to me like a good fit.

00:26.809 --> 00:29.852
And I felt Arthur would get a little bit lost in...

00:30.136 --> 00:34.222
the kind of frenetic pace that Saturday morning offers children.

00:35.124 --> 00:36.686
It's just not the way he is.

00:36.766 --> 00:43.176
He's grounded in real life, and he goes at a child's realistic pace.

00:43.597 --> 00:47.623
And I think that's why kids relate to him so well in the books.

00:47.903 --> 00:54.072
And it didn't feel true to me to put him in that kind of an atmosphere.

00:54.994 --> 00:55.755
And...

00:55.904 --> 01:10.779
So I kind of forgot about Arthur being on television for a long time until GBH in Boston came to me and said, we'd like to put Arthur on television in animated form.

01:10.879 --> 01:15.644
And I thought, oh, wow, this is kind of a different ballgame.

01:15.684 --> 01:22.430
And I said, you know, I want to control a lot of things about this show.

01:22.470 --> 01:25.033
If Arthur's going to be on there, I want this to be done well.

01:25.520 --> 01:32.890
and I would want to choose the animators and choose the voices and the storyboards and the writers.

01:32.990 --> 01:37.837
And I thought, when I hear this list, I'm never going to speak to me again.

01:38.317 --> 01:38.998
But they did.

01:39.038 --> 01:49.993
They agreed to all of those controls, and I thought it was a real leap of faith on their part to want to work with somebody who was such a control freak.

01:51.435 --> 01:54.379
And it's been a wonderful partnership,

01:54.916 --> 01:56.138
When did you start working on it?

01:56.799 --> 01:57.761
About two years ago.

01:57.801 --> 01:58.202
Really?

01:58.302 --> 01:58.803
Yeah.

01:59.003 --> 02:05.034
So this first, this premiere forthcoming is the culmination of two years of production?

02:05.054 --> 02:07.218
It's almost anti-climax.

02:07.519 --> 02:07.819
Wow.

02:07.839 --> 02:10.684
It's like, well, we're working on year two now.

02:11.426 --> 02:13.349
Well, my daughter and I would love to watch credits.

02:14.992 --> 02:15.353
Uh-huh.

02:15.573 --> 02:15.934
Yeah.

02:16.014 --> 02:16.114
Yeah.

02:16.280 --> 02:17.221
It's one of those things.

02:18.242 --> 02:25.251
I was astounded at the number of personnel that put this thing together.

02:25.271 --> 02:28.135
It is amazing, isn't it?

02:28.155 --> 02:29.396
It's 50 or 100 people there.

02:29.416 --> 02:30.558
It's so expensive.

02:30.938 --> 02:35.584
I don't know if it's the most expensive show that WGBH has ever produced or not.

02:35.824 --> 02:36.104
Really?

02:36.204 --> 02:36.685
Yes.

02:37.205 --> 02:39.749
Oh, millions and millions of dollars.

02:39.769 --> 02:42.754
Why is that when there is no talent, so to speak?

02:42.774 --> 02:46.199
Well, the cost of animation is so expensive.

02:46.259 --> 02:47.942
I thought computers helped a lot.

02:48.042 --> 02:49.124
Well, they help some.

02:49.805 --> 02:55.394
But, you know, the humans still have to prepare all of this stuff.

02:55.514 --> 02:58.259
All of the backgrounds have to be painted.

02:58.279 --> 03:03.567
And I worked for months with the animators, just getting the characters looking

03:04.019 --> 03:09.887
the way they should look as they've rotated in space and, you know, as Arthur has different expressions.

03:10.367 --> 03:15.614
Just, I remember having a whole meeting in Montreal over the way characters would walk.

03:17.297 --> 03:22.664
It's like that, and picking the voices and working with the very... You were going to ask about the voices.

03:22.684 --> 03:25.267
Did you have a sense of how, of what you should sound?

03:25.287 --> 03:33.418
I knew I would know Arthur's voice when I heard it, and they'd sent me lots of tapes of different actors auditioning for Arthur,

03:33.736 --> 03:35.278
And one boy just stood out.

03:35.939 --> 03:37.942
His voice just sounded like Arthur.

03:37.982 --> 03:40.866
The kid's dream come true, right?

03:41.166 --> 03:45.652
Well, you know, I think I'm going to just turn that off.

03:45.672 --> 03:49.638
I'm lucky that he wanted to do the part.

03:51.861 --> 03:54.524
And, you know, I think he's enjoying it.

03:54.925 --> 04:00.773
But he's also a very talented actor in films, and he's gotten three big

04:00.955 --> 04:03.300
movie roles since he took on this.

04:03.320 --> 04:06.186
I think right now he's filming a movie with Meryl Streep.

04:07.810 --> 04:09.353
And of course his voice might change.

04:09.373 --> 04:10.034
Oh, I know.

04:10.054 --> 04:17.310
I pray every night, please, God, let Michael's voice stay young.

04:18.202 --> 04:26.576
Did your daughters feel like the character sounded right?

04:26.636 --> 04:26.997
That's good.

04:27.177 --> 04:37.794
Oh, that's great to hear.

04:39.477 --> 04:42.943
You know, let me also say my older daughter is a big

04:44.138 --> 04:45.860
Bart Simpson fan, right?

04:46.561 --> 04:46.881
Yeah.

04:46.921 --> 04:48.123
My daughter is, too.

04:48.143 --> 04:50.686
You talk about a character who is the complete antithesis.

04:52.588 --> 04:56.273
I mean, do you see it that way, too, in terms of this as an achiever?

04:56.953 --> 05:09.589
Oddly enough, Arthur is being animated at the same studio in Korea where The Simpsons are done, and I had a nightmare that Arthur was going to come back with a jagged head.

05:09.609 --> 05:11.631
Oh, that's funny.

05:11.651 --> 05:12.272
That's funny.

05:12.421 --> 05:19.148
Yeah, maybe they could have a guest on each other's show or something.

05:20.029 --> 05:28.657
But do you see him, if you don't mind jumping around in the interview here, but do you see Arthur as the antithesis character?

05:28.697 --> 05:35.564
Maybe that's one reason out of many why public television GBH would come to you.

05:35.924 --> 05:41.770
Maybe they'd see some values here being not so subtly

05:42.307 --> 05:54.521
I think what they see in the series is that Arthur is a real kid and he deals with real problems that kids seven, eight years old have to deal with in their lives.

05:55.442 --> 05:56.503
It's how he solves them.

05:56.544 --> 05:59.387
He solves them pretty well for a seven or eight year old kid.

05:59.988 --> 06:01.890
I think that kids relate to that.

06:03.411 --> 06:06.475
When we were putting this TV show together,

06:06.961 --> 06:20.860
In the back of my mind, I had as this model, this sounds so ridiculous when I say it out loud, but the Mary Tyler Moore Show, which I thought worked so well as a sitcom.

06:21.982 --> 06:31.956
There were a lot of issues that they dealt with in there that they did with humor, but the writing was so good and the acting was so good.

06:32.240 --> 06:34.262
And I kind of used that as a model.

06:34.282 --> 06:43.011
I thought if I could take anything from television that had been successful and kind of work on that foundation, it would be that show.

06:44.212 --> 06:47.935
So I kind of think of Arthur as this Mary Tyler Moore show for kids.

06:48.696 --> 06:56.804
And it's bringing the issues from their lives and putting them into sort of an entertaining situation.

06:57.605 --> 06:59.867
And it's about problem solving.

06:59.982 --> 07:01.323
for young kids, really.

07:01.404 --> 07:03.005
No, he's a third grader.

07:04.787 --> 07:06.829
Is this kind of your target audience?

07:07.450 --> 07:11.795
Of course, you have to also impress parents, too.

07:12.015 --> 07:21.565
Well, even in my books, I'm aware that parents have to read these books to their kids at night, as I do to my kids, you know, did to my kids.

07:21.885 --> 07:29.854
And I want something in there that's going to appeal to parents as well, if I can, without sacrificing

07:30.188 --> 07:32.491
what I'm doing for the children first.

07:34.093 --> 07:41.243
So my target group, I think it's four to eight, somewhere in that range.

07:42.145 --> 07:49.034
But what they're finding is that kids are interested in watching animation of all ages.

07:49.255 --> 07:52.219
Even younger kids love to watch animation.

07:53.140 --> 07:56.044
And my daughter was in fifth grade.

07:56.564 --> 08:01.692
She comes into the studio every day and says, did you get a new tape to look at yet, Dad?

08:01.712 --> 08:02.893
She wants to know.

08:03.554 --> 08:09.023
She likes to sit down with me when I go through and make notes on each tape that comes in.

08:09.123 --> 08:14.190
Our ninth river came running downstairs to watch this last night from her homework.

08:14.210 --> 08:15.212
That's nice to hear.

08:15.272 --> 08:15.833
And loved it.

08:16.053 --> 08:16.714
It really did.

08:16.734 --> 08:18.657
She was just jumping up and down.

08:19.008 --> 08:21.211
Arthur, Arthur.

08:21.231 --> 08:28.880
Also, the voice of Mr. Ratbone is pretty... Now, did you choose... He's a very interesting character.

08:28.920 --> 08:29.441
He is.

08:29.481 --> 08:34.848
He's based on a real teacher I had in seventh grade, my algebra teacher.

08:34.908 --> 08:42.017
And oddly enough, the actor who plays him looks a lot like my seventh grade teacher.

08:42.077 --> 08:45.000
I was really kind of scared when I first saw him.

08:46.462 --> 08:47.884
You know, I've taken a...

08:48.438 --> 08:57.370
My teacher, who to me was kind of a terrifying teacher, and I made him kind of a nice guy, the way I wish he were in real life.

08:58.071 --> 09:08.104
You know, I liked the structure in this classroom, but there was this kind of sinister quality about him that was... Yeah, I made him a rat.

09:08.125 --> 09:08.385
Yeah, I know.

09:08.405 --> 09:09.526
He looked like a rat.

09:10.808 --> 09:14.874
His name was Rathbun, but... Oh, you mean the name was that close?

09:14.954 --> 09:18.158
It was that close, but we all called him the Rat.

09:18.728 --> 09:27.057
And he had this kind of a long pointed nose, and he had these little green hairs that stuck out of the end of his nose, little claws.

09:28.078 --> 09:28.338
Really?

09:29.699 --> 09:35.525
But he's a very—he doesn't eat nails, as alleged.

09:35.545 --> 09:36.026
No.

09:36.666 --> 09:46.997
And there is—does seem to be some very valuable lessons to be learned from this man, and he does, you know—I mean, again, there seems to be a little moral in these—

09:47.686 --> 09:50.990
No, that's all right.

09:51.590 --> 09:53.412
You've done more than a hundred books, I guess.

09:53.753 --> 09:54.113
Is that right?

09:54.233 --> 09:55.375
Not all Arthur books.

09:55.395 --> 09:57.057
Oh, that's right, but that's my point.

09:58.618 --> 10:00.841
Walt Disney used to say, it all began with a mouse.

10:01.341 --> 10:03.944
With you, it seems to be an eidmark.

10:04.004 --> 10:15.477
It's amazing to me what's sort of happening here with the television and the 20th anniversary of Arthur.

10:15.878 --> 10:17.119
It's like an overnight

10:17.437 --> 10:18.078
success.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.419
Now I know what people say.

10:19.459 --> 10:35.517
You know, they work all their life doing something and then all of a sudden there's this sudden interest from all of these factions that come together and something magical happens and I'm kind of in awe of what's going on right now.

10:36.719 --> 10:41.284
Well, I mean, you say over that success after 20 years of trying, which is kind of funny.

10:41.664 --> 10:44.187
People don't appreciate how long it takes to become

10:44.808 --> 10:46.891
as the overnight success.

10:47.512 --> 11:13.532
It also says something about our culture and how we value television, too, how powerful television is, that doing these books for 20 years and having them be successful in children's publishing, but taking that leap to television, I think, is a remarkable... It opens up this audience to a much larger sphere

11:14.221 --> 11:22.955
And it elevates it somehow in the public's perception of what's important for children.

11:23.816 --> 11:25.899
Does it worry you as a trend?

11:26.941 --> 11:27.201
No.

11:27.622 --> 11:28.944
I think it's always been there.

11:28.984 --> 11:35.634
I'm just a part of it now, and I'm kind of watching it and amazed by the whole process.

11:36.235 --> 11:39.300
But I don't think television's a bad medium.

11:39.550 --> 11:43.994
I think it's a powerful medium, and I think it can be used really well.

11:44.295 --> 11:46.737
Just most often, it's not used well.

11:47.538 --> 11:56.567
In your field, in particular, I mean, do you see all this interactive stuff, and you work with Broderbund with the TV-ROMs?

11:56.627 --> 12:01.511
I mean, you're doing lots of different audio-visual things, interactive things, TV.

12:03.293 --> 12:06.716
Where does the printed book remain in your future, or does it?

12:06.997 --> 12:07.998
Well, it's my anchor.

12:08.118 --> 12:09.439
It's what I love to do.

12:09.706 --> 12:32.929
the most these other things are fun for me and I mean I never thought in my life I would be involved in designing toys but in order to support the public television show certain things have to happen that because the cost of animation and millions of dollars going into the show

12:33.348 --> 12:51.345
So, you know, I'm working with a toy designer, and they're doing little sort of movable part characters of Arthur, his family, his friends, and a board game, and things I never thought I would be doing, but I'm really enjoying it.

12:52.045 --> 12:56.569
And I'm seeing that, you know, I have something to bring to it, because I know the characters so well.

12:56.690 --> 13:02.595
I think I approach it from a child's perspective, too.

13:03.233 --> 13:09.861
Now, the stories for the TV series, are these stories that you've written, or are you more or less a consultant on all these?

13:09.881 --> 13:13.626
Well, you know, for the first year alone, we had to have 60 stories.

13:14.386 --> 13:14.467
Wow.

13:14.487 --> 13:24.278
They're 30 half hours they've done for year one, and each show is comprised of two stories that, as you saw, they're linked with that interstitial.

13:24.338 --> 13:25.680
Did you have that on your tape?

13:26.099 --> 13:27.381
Were there live action?

13:27.842 --> 13:28.242
Oh, yeah.

13:28.262 --> 13:30.245
Well, the kids were talking about the teachers.

13:30.285 --> 13:31.788
Now a word from us kids.

13:31.808 --> 13:32.429
This is Ms.

13:32.509 --> 13:33.230
Glenn Denning.

13:33.490 --> 13:34.351
Yeah.

13:34.572 --> 13:45.969
And each one of those will be different, and they'll kind of relate to the themes of the two shows on either side of it, which I think is a nice way to bring the kids in.

13:46.970 --> 13:54.081
And we want to find more ways to do that in the show where we can really involve real kids who are watching the show.

13:54.314 --> 13:56.637
and put them in that interstitial element.

13:58.040 --> 14:00.363
You've kind of done that from the beginning, as I understand it.

14:00.523 --> 14:04.970
You really do go out in the field, so to speak, and you do interact with kids.

14:04.990 --> 14:08.195
Do you get story ideas from them?

14:08.415 --> 14:09.456
Oh, absolutely.

14:10.057 --> 14:20.052
I get about 100,000 letters a year from kids that come here to the studio, and we answer every one of them.

14:20.285 --> 14:27.175
And my publisher gets more that go to the publisher, and they have people who, you know, students.

14:27.195 --> 14:28.597
You answer every one?

14:28.617 --> 14:30.319
Yeah, we do answer every one.

14:30.659 --> 14:39.432
I mean, it's not a long, involved letter, but I make sure that the kids get a fun postcard or, you know, something so that there's a response there.

14:40.794 --> 14:42.536
You're rewarding the interest.

14:42.556 --> 14:46.782
I mean, you don't want a kid who takes the time to write an author of a book.

14:46.897 --> 14:48.339
It should be rewarded, I think.

14:48.539 --> 14:49.361
Exactly.

14:49.441 --> 14:51.684
I put myself in their position.

14:51.724 --> 14:56.932
If I were writing a letter to someone, I'd want to get a response, just because they're children.

14:57.673 --> 15:01.979
I mean, how arrogant could someone be to not do that?

15:03.341 --> 15:12.254
And I've been at schools when kids have said, you know, oh, I wrote this or that author, and they never wrote me back, and oh, it is.

15:14.337 --> 15:16.060
You must have a staff for this.

15:16.428 --> 15:23.920
I have one full-time assistant, a studio manager who helps me, and that's recently.

15:26.945 --> 15:28.287
I can't believe how long.

15:28.367 --> 15:31.853
I must be a masochist or something.

15:31.873 --> 15:40.306
You trained at the Cleveland Art Institute, I understand, and was your intention then to be a book illustrator?

15:41.348 --> 15:43.431
No, I was studying to be a painter.

15:43.867 --> 15:55.365
And I kind of registered the power of picture books when I was in high school, and I read Where the Wild Things Are by Sendak.

15:56.668 --> 15:58.310
And I was really impressed.

15:58.430 --> 16:10.009
I had a new baby sister when I was a senior in high school, and I read books to her even when she was a little baby.

16:10.259 --> 16:16.489
starting to see, you know, picture books, and I was kind of looking at them from a different perspective.

16:17.630 --> 16:22.558
But in art school, it was just one of the lowest rungs of the art ladder.

16:22.578 --> 16:24.701
You just didn't talk about it.

16:25.863 --> 16:26.684
It was taboo.

16:27.546 --> 16:28.327
Because what?

16:28.968 --> 16:30.450
Well, they just didn't respect it.

16:31.151 --> 16:36.059
And I guess I was worried about what other people thought of me, I guess.

16:36.119 --> 16:38.663
You know, it's something...

16:39.200 --> 16:42.846
And so I didn't explore that at all.

16:43.507 --> 16:45.089
And they didn't really encourage it.

16:46.071 --> 16:49.156
But there weren't courses in children's illustration.

16:49.216 --> 16:53.663
There were courses in illustration, but I never seemed to deal with that part of illustration.

16:54.764 --> 17:00.393
So when I came to this field, it was as a painter and more of a fine artist.

17:00.513 --> 17:07.384
And I guess I thought I was approaching books more in a fine art fashion, where I was

17:08.090 --> 17:11.274
I was looking to please adults rather than children.

17:11.314 --> 17:21.705
And when my son was born, I saw how important, Dr. Seuss, I used to think, when I would look at those books.

17:22.286 --> 17:35.481
But reading them to my son and seeing how powerful they were and what they could do for kids and building their confidence in learning to read by memorizing this rhythmic story that was there,

17:36.389 --> 17:54.816
and the power of humor in picture books, it kind of gave me permission to loosen up and to have fun with them and to kind of revert back to being a five-year-old, six-year-old child and look at the world from that perspective again.

17:54.836 --> 17:57.920
And, you know, I want to hold on to that.

17:58.541 --> 17:59.863
I felt like I had lost it.

18:00.183 --> 18:03.668
A phrase you've used in some of your interviews is painterly.

18:03.688 --> 18:04.429
Oh, yeah.

18:04.450 --> 18:04.810
It's not a

18:05.515 --> 18:08.919
You don't take a painterly approach to what you're doing now.

18:09.139 --> 18:10.461
I guess I don't at all.

18:11.022 --> 18:11.762
Which is a nice word.

18:11.782 --> 18:12.844
I've not seen it before.

18:12.864 --> 18:15.126
I know.

18:15.187 --> 18:21.734
I guess I'm not worried about them being the kinds of books that will have the metallic stickers on them in the libraries.

18:24.518 --> 18:34.830
To me, the awards that I have won, the most important ones have been the ones that the kids have voted on.

18:35.468 --> 18:37.450
That's what's important to me.

18:38.511 --> 18:48.601
You said in the 1993 Publishers Weekly interview that you thought that when this contract with Lou Brown was up, that Arthur would be done.

18:49.041 --> 18:51.824
Obviously, that's you dispensed with that.

18:53.385 --> 18:56.889
Yeah, I'm not finished with him yet.

18:58.050 --> 19:02.754
I guess at a certain level, I feel a responsibility, too, to kids.

19:02.855 --> 19:05.357
They want more stories about Arthur.

19:06.097 --> 19:08.520
And I'm still having fun with him.

19:08.661 --> 19:10.443
I'm still having fun with the characters.

19:11.104 --> 19:18.855
And in a way, the television series has opened up this whole little world of Arthur for me.

19:20.117 --> 19:24.523
Just the fact that you have to, we had to know what Arthur's parents did.

19:24.543 --> 19:33.235
And, you know, when you go to Francine's house, which I haven't really done in the books,

19:33.637 --> 19:35.980
You have to know, well, what's her family like?

19:36.160 --> 19:39.964
And Buster, does he have a mother and a father?

19:40.004 --> 19:44.549
It so happens his parents are divorced and he lives with his mom.

19:46.091 --> 19:51.397
And it allowed me to really broaden this whole world that I've been working with.

19:51.497 --> 19:57.203
And I've been kind of myopic in looking at Arthur and his family and their little world.

19:57.564 --> 20:00.387
But now I get a chance to really open it up.

20:00.755 --> 20:03.519
It's giving me all kinds of other ideas.

20:04.320 --> 20:11.311
Do you find that you personally have to know more about your characters and their lives than you'll ever put in the book?

20:11.431 --> 20:17.139
I mean, you just mentioned, for instance, the parents of one of the characters who were divorced, what their house looks like.

20:17.219 --> 20:20.805
I really— I imagine in your own mind you have to know what this whole community is.

20:21.886 --> 20:23.809
I did a map of the town.

20:24.278 --> 20:33.570
It's very involved, where everyone's house is, where the school is, where Grandma Thora lives, where the amusement park is, and there's a lake.

20:33.710 --> 20:34.711
That's interesting, yeah.

20:34.731 --> 20:44.123
And it was so much fun to do that and give it to the animators so that they could sort of see where everything had to work.

20:44.143 --> 20:52.834
I had to make a floor plan for Arthur's house, where the rooms really are and how they worked, so when they moved cinematically

20:53.202 --> 20:56.306
from room to room, where were they going?

20:56.386 --> 20:57.467
How were they getting there?

20:57.508 --> 20:58.549
That's funny.

20:59.009 --> 21:00.291
It's fun.

21:00.351 --> 21:05.898
When you're doing the books, what come first, the pictures, the illustrations, or the stories?

21:06.419 --> 21:07.881
The stories, definitely.

21:08.502 --> 21:10.144
And to me it's like hard work.

21:11.085 --> 21:13.508
It's sort of like cleaning the house so you can have a party.

21:16.832 --> 21:18.855
Because I don't think of myself as a writer.

21:19.409 --> 21:23.835
I enjoy writing, and I enjoy telling stories to kids.

21:24.356 --> 21:35.392
But I guess I was waiting for a long time when I started into this business for other people to write fun, amusing stories for me to illustrate.

21:35.853 --> 21:36.914
And nobody was doing it.

21:37.856 --> 21:43.424
And that's when I discovered that my bedtime stories weren't so bad, and maybe I should use one of those.

21:43.484 --> 21:46.969
And so for me, the whole...

21:47.185 --> 21:49.648
the hard work is getting that foundation there.

21:50.289 --> 21:54.395
And while I'm writing, I sort of see things in my head cinematically.

21:54.976 --> 21:58.240
You know, is this a good opportunity for a picture?

21:59.402 --> 22:11.659
And then when the story's written, I start to do sketches and see, you know, well, maybe I have to change the story a little bit because the picture could tell the story better in this place.

22:12.741 --> 22:14.944
And so you constantly weigh these two elements.

22:15.044 --> 22:16.686
The picture is there to do

22:17.003 --> 22:19.847
what the words can't do most of the time.

22:20.348 --> 22:22.551
So they complement one another, certainly.

22:22.571 --> 22:23.373
Yeah.

22:23.393 --> 22:25.916
Have you ever worked with another writer?

22:25.996 --> 22:31.324
I know you have a collaboration with your wife, but that's... Yeah, I've worked with other writers.

22:32.747 --> 22:40.699
Verna Ardema comes to mind, who does a lot of African folktales, and Diane Wolkstein.

22:40.719 --> 22:43.703
I did a Haitian folktale with her.

22:44.408 --> 22:46.490
I worked with Isaac Asimov.

22:46.510 --> 22:48.091
That was my very first book.

22:48.892 --> 22:49.953
Right out of art school.

22:50.513 --> 22:51.635
What was the title of that?

22:51.655 --> 22:52.876
What Makes the Sunshine.

22:52.936 --> 22:56.279
And it was a non-fiction book for kids.

22:57.600 --> 23:00.202
And I was so worried about what he would think.

23:01.323 --> 23:06.788
And my editor said, well, he looked at your sketches and he said, at first I didn't know what to think.

23:06.888 --> 23:11.232
And then I reverted to a six-year-old child and thoroughly enjoyed it.

23:11.653 --> 23:12.914
I met him once.

23:13.014 --> 23:14.415
He was an amazing guy.

23:15.509 --> 23:18.013
Do you have any questions for Martha?

23:21.698 --> 23:26.125
Oh, that's nice.

23:26.285 --> 23:28.769
That's the best compliment I could have.

23:28.789 --> 23:40.827
And the kids suggest them, like you mentioned divorce.

23:40.887 --> 23:43.491
I mean, so would some kids say to you,

23:43.876 --> 23:48.281
Gee, maybe you should write about what it's like to live in a hundred.

23:48.542 --> 23:49.663
Absolutely.

23:50.084 --> 23:59.615
I remember when the book that Laurie and I did together, Dinosaurs Divorce, which I think is the book I'm proudest of, of all the hundred books I've done.

23:59.655 --> 23:59.936
Really?

24:00.496 --> 24:13.292
It came from my experience when I was divorced back in the early 70s, and I had my two sons, and I went to the library with them to try and find a book about divorce, and

24:13.947 --> 24:43.245
all of the books were about one family's experience and none of them were quite like ours because the boys were at that point living with me during the weekend with their mom on the weekends and it seemed, you know, too bad that all the fathers in these books, you know, lived in downtown hotels or something and it was kind of gloomy and depressing and, you know, there were difficult issues with divorce, no doubt about it, but

24:43.428 --> 24:46.792
there were also some positive elements that could come out of it.

24:46.992 --> 24:56.222
And so a few years later when I met Laurie, that was one of the first books I said, gee, I'd really love to do a good book on divorce.

24:56.322 --> 25:03.329
And she said, oh, I don't think I, because she had lived through a divorce as a child and she had divorced before we met.

25:04.410 --> 25:09.436
And she said, I don't think I could deal with that topic, but she did really well.

25:10.056 --> 25:10.617
And, uh,

25:11.440 --> 25:19.430
I think that when I went to schools and started talking about that book to kids, kids would come up to me.

25:19.450 --> 25:20.751
They would seek me out.

25:21.452 --> 25:30.223
When their teachers were saying, come on, let's go back to the room now, they would run over to me and they would want to share what was going on in their lives with them.

25:30.904 --> 25:33.006
That book was powerful.

25:33.527 --> 25:37.532
It's a catalog of divorce information for kids.

25:37.715 --> 25:40.898
But through the experiences of dinosaurs, tell me how that happened.

25:40.918 --> 25:50.028
And the American Library Association, they said, this is a terrific book, but we're not going to make it one of our notable books for the year because it's not people, it's dinosaurs.

25:50.689 --> 25:52.611
And they missed, they didn't get it.

25:53.412 --> 26:02.001
The reason that it's dinosaurs is that it allows the families to just separate themselves just enough from their own problem

26:02.251 --> 26:07.938
to get back and laugh at these dinosaurs making these same mistakes that they might be making in their lives.

26:08.999 --> 26:16.228
It's a way of letting parents sit down with their kids and be a little more comfortable talking about something that's really difficult.

26:18.911 --> 26:21.595
Yeah, it seemed like it was something that was helpful.

26:24.798 --> 26:31.887
It came out, I think, in 82, 83, and I'll give you a copy of it.

26:32.137 --> 26:37.086
Yeah, we might even use it in our piece, actually.

26:37.647 --> 26:40.252
And it's the best-selling book.

26:40.432 --> 26:42.856
It's my best-selling book of all my books.

26:42.876 --> 26:43.978
Who was the publisher of that?

26:44.018 --> 26:53.335
Little Brown.

27:05.195 --> 27:06.757
Okay, my tape is working fine.

27:06.897 --> 27:17.833
I always make sure we're machines or how we're bound by our machines, you know.

27:18.554 --> 27:24.042
Yeah, Laurie is scrupulous in her researching of all these subjects.

27:24.062 --> 27:26.866
We just did a book on death, too.

27:26.886 --> 27:27.787
It just came out.

27:27.827 --> 27:31.252
It's been getting all starred reviews.

27:31.312 --> 27:34.797
That's another topic that people... This came from...

27:35.300 --> 28:05.121
families wanting the same approach with the dinosaurs to another difficult topic and right now I'm redoing a couple of the illustrations for a Japanese edition which is exciting and it just thrills us to think of people in Japan wanting to use this book and I mean they just love the book 10 years 1986 selling more now than it did

28:05.658 --> 28:06.779
when it first came out.

28:09.122 --> 28:09.723
That's great.

28:10.564 --> 28:11.024
Yeah.

28:11.044 --> 28:11.745
That's spectacular.

28:11.825 --> 28:15.750
If you have a paperback... It's too bad that it's... I wouldn't want to take one of your first editions.

28:15.770 --> 28:18.413
I'm sure Laurie has some paperbacks downstairs.

28:18.973 --> 28:19.674
Yeah.

28:19.734 --> 28:21.917
We could use one, certainly, in our piece.

28:21.937 --> 28:22.037
Yeah.

28:22.117 --> 28:22.457
All right.

28:22.557 --> 28:24.119
I'd love to give it to you.

28:25.080 --> 28:30.206
And feel free to take the dinosaur's dye, too, because that's brand new.

28:30.366 --> 28:31.347
I'll take it.

28:31.367 --> 28:31.467
Yeah.

28:31.488 --> 28:31.988
It just didn't come in.

28:32.949 --> 28:33.770
It just came out.

28:33.790 --> 28:34.551
It just came out.

28:34.700 --> 28:37.243
Oh, that's very important.

28:39.406 --> 28:41.148
This will be like a thousand-word piece.

28:41.208 --> 28:44.232
There will be some depth to it.

28:44.252 --> 28:46.494
Oh, that's great.

28:48.256 --> 28:51.120
Primarily, it's a book piece.

28:51.220 --> 28:55.365
The television tie-in is wonderful, but he's going to get us into some television sections.

28:56.346 --> 29:01.973
Well, I hope Arthur, who is so accessible to kids and families,

29:02.290 --> 29:20.907
will allow me in the future to do other pieces that could be a little more meatier topics on death and divorce and things that families really struggle with where you might mix animation and live action.

29:21.443 --> 29:28.951
And, I mean, I've seen Dinosaurs Divorced as an hour family special in my head for years.

29:29.091 --> 29:31.754
And I'm just, I hear the music I want to use.

29:33.175 --> 29:35.238
So it's something I've got to do in my life.

29:35.658 --> 29:38.761
And so that'll be another challenge.

29:40.423 --> 29:41.825
So tell me about your day.

29:41.925 --> 29:44.347
I mean, you're involved with software.

29:44.447 --> 29:45.569
You're involved with CD-1.

29:45.709 --> 29:47.150
I know.

29:47.170 --> 29:47.891
You're doing TV.

29:47.911 --> 29:48.131
It's crazy.

29:48.151 --> 29:50.674
Of course, being close to Boston and where it's being produced.

29:50.907 --> 29:52.248
That was lucky, wasn't it?

29:52.268 --> 29:55.932
Well, lucky, but it's a curse, too, because you probably have to go up there a lot.

29:56.092 --> 29:58.895
No, actually, the fax machine.

29:58.915 --> 30:00.096
Oh, that's right.

30:00.116 --> 30:01.097
It's amazing.

30:01.998 --> 30:04.580
I work with the animators in Montreal.

30:04.981 --> 30:15.751
The drawings will come in by fax for each show, little background props or situations, and I'll redraw things that I don't like and want to change.

30:16.092 --> 30:17.753
You're keeping some firm control, then.

30:18.234 --> 30:19.395
I am a control freak.

30:20.084 --> 30:24.209
It is my main issue in my life, I mean, with everything.

30:25.231 --> 30:27.373
It's good and it's bad.

30:27.413 --> 30:34.943
Do you see this kind of getting into the realm of, you know, who's this character on TV?

30:35.183 --> 30:35.504
Barney.

30:35.524 --> 30:38.087
Barney, yeah.

30:38.107 --> 30:43.194
I never thought I would be grateful to Barney, but I think in Boston we're following Barney.

30:43.514 --> 30:49.602
And that's pretty good when you get linked up with a hit show.

30:49.818 --> 31:06.657
You know, I think Barney, there's a lot of Barney bashing that goes on, but just as there has been some Mr. Rogers bashing, you know, how people say things, but they forget that they're not looking at these shows from a child's perspective.

31:07.738 --> 31:17.108
And these characters, whether we as adults appreciate them or not, they do speak directly to kids, and kids get that.

31:17.476 --> 31:19.359
I think kids are amazing.

31:19.379 --> 31:20.801
They're so honest.

31:21.822 --> 31:32.018
And I think that they can tell when adults are being honest with them or not, or trying to talk to them and not at them.

31:32.739 --> 31:37.225
And I think that Barney does that, whether I like it or not.

31:38.848 --> 31:41.472
But I think that Barney does that.

31:43.214 --> 31:44.156
Tell us a little bit.

31:44.276 --> 31:45.778
I read also that you've...

31:46.180 --> 31:48.022
much more time you might be an architect.

31:48.483 --> 31:48.723
Yeah.

31:48.743 --> 31:52.908
And I guess, you know, we're in a, this is a, is this colonial era over here?

31:52.948 --> 31:59.576
Yeah, this is a, this house, our hobby is restoring antique houses, and we've done six of them now.

32:00.037 --> 32:00.197
Wow.

32:00.918 --> 32:02.940
And this one is, was built in 1840.

32:03.160 --> 32:06.184
It was the town butcher's house.

32:06.785 --> 32:09.188
He had his cattle out here.

32:09.208 --> 32:10.349
He had 40 acres.

32:11.510 --> 32:12.812
And, um,

32:13.298 --> 32:17.084
I'd done some research on the house to find out about him.

32:17.124 --> 32:19.408
His name was Henry Ripley.

32:21.251 --> 32:22.293
Was it Henry Ripley?

32:22.353 --> 32:23.615
Well, it was Ripley, anyway.

32:23.635 --> 32:37.838
I found his obituary at the town library, and they had this great obituary where, yes, Mr. Ripley went upstairs and they heard his candlestick drop to the floor.

32:38.442 --> 32:42.588
That was, you know, ooh, that was the end of Mr. Ripley.

32:42.888 --> 32:48.536
Revenge of the coal mines, probably.

32:49.978 --> 32:53.423
And I guess we go to the vineyard, we have a house in the vineyard.

32:53.443 --> 32:53.543
Yeah.

32:53.784 --> 32:56.748
So I gather you have a colonial, is that right?

32:56.808 --> 33:01.935
Yeah, these old houses that are falling down and need work they call out to us.

33:02.168 --> 33:04.551
You do the actual work?

33:05.312 --> 33:06.013
We used to.

33:06.133 --> 33:21.414
The first house on the vineyard in Gay Head, Lori and I, we literally tore the old plaster off the lath ourselves and lived with the lath on the walls and no plaster until we could afford to put plaster back on.

33:22.135 --> 33:29.205
And the first night we slept there, the roof had so many holes in it, we kept moving our bed and it was leaking.

33:29.590 --> 33:32.394
Just like five times until we found the dry spot.

33:33.655 --> 33:35.097
Where is your current house in the vineyards?

33:35.417 --> 33:36.899
It's on Lambert's Cove Road.

33:37.140 --> 33:39.142
It's an old farm.

33:39.362 --> 33:46.151
It was built in 1735 and needed a lot of work.

33:46.171 --> 33:48.073
It was on the market, I think, for three years.

33:48.133 --> 33:50.957
Nobody wanted it.

33:51.764 --> 33:54.808
Now you say you've restored six.

33:54.828 --> 33:56.170
Do you still own the six?

33:56.190 --> 33:57.732
No, no.

33:58.153 --> 33:59.995
It's kind of like living in a sculpture.

34:00.716 --> 34:03.200
And when it's finished, you move on.

34:04.942 --> 34:15.477
I'm really struggling to not get sort of bored with these houses, because this house is pretty much finished now.

34:15.980 --> 34:29.480
Our daughter doesn't like to hear it, but we know we want to move to Boston at some point when she gets a little older and, you know, when her school is at a point where she's not having to be in Hingham anymore.

34:30.602 --> 34:35.289
But I look forward to, you know, finding an old house in Boston and fixing it up.

34:35.549 --> 34:43.461
Oh, there's some great houses in, yeah, Back Bay, Beacon Hill, South End.

34:44.422 --> 34:45.784
This part of the country is...

34:45.967 --> 34:48.109
And you're a Midwesterner.

34:48.510 --> 34:49.931
Actually, Pennsylvania, right?

34:50.291 --> 34:51.092
Yeah.

34:51.513 --> 34:55.617
It's kind of on the edge of the east, but I felt like a Midwesterner growing up.

34:57.338 --> 35:02.904
But my dad loved architecture, and we would come to New England on vacations.

35:02.924 --> 35:06.447
The sun coming through all by me, but I want to take advantage of it.

35:06.467 --> 35:06.948
Nope.

35:06.968 --> 35:09.150
All by me.

35:09.571 --> 35:13.054
So, when did you come east?

35:13.321 --> 35:15.424
Well, that probably wasn't very good.

35:15.524 --> 35:16.185
Don't worry.

35:16.505 --> 35:20.210
Connie doesn't let a single picture that's bad go out, so I— All right.

35:20.330 --> 35:24.315
Thank you, Connie.

35:24.376 --> 35:29.783
I don't know what they sent you.

35:29.823 --> 35:34.769
We have some papers that like— And we're going to go over there and take some pictures.

35:34.869 --> 35:37.493
I did an interview with Margaret Ray a couple months ago.

35:37.513 --> 35:38.054
Oh, did you?

35:38.474 --> 35:41.438
And I have to say, she has more curious—

35:41.637 --> 35:44.500
George is in her home, and you have Oxford, but you're young.

35:44.960 --> 35:46.101
You'll catch up.

35:46.301 --> 35:47.202
I don't know.

35:47.443 --> 35:49.705
There's too many around here.

35:49.965 --> 35:50.846
You're under 50.

35:51.466 --> 35:52.367
Yeah.

35:53.849 --> 35:54.489
Holding.

35:55.070 --> 35:56.051
I'm holding.

35:56.071 --> 35:58.133
How do you see the arc of your career?

35:58.493 --> 36:00.395
Oh, gee.

36:00.555 --> 36:03.358
I don't plan that far ahead, really.

36:04.459 --> 36:08.623
I'm really enjoying what's happening right now.

36:09.123 --> 36:11.205
To me, this is like answered prayers.

36:12.147 --> 36:18.315
And it's a little scary because of all the work that's coming along with it.

36:18.455 --> 36:22.501
I'm just trying to stay on top of all the things that I wished for.

36:22.561 --> 36:28.869
They're here now, and I want to make sure I'm doing the best I can with each of these things.

36:30.131 --> 36:34.456
Is there anything I haven't covered that you can think of?

36:34.576 --> 36:35.838
Well, you have great questions.

36:36.399 --> 36:37.260
Well, thanks.

36:37.848 --> 36:41.912
I try to move them along, because I know your time is precious.

36:42.233 --> 36:43.935
I'd love for you to inscribe them.

36:43.955 --> 36:44.936
Oh, yeah, let me do these.

36:45.036 --> 36:47.158
One for Barbara and one for Nicole.

36:47.218 --> 36:48.439
Does it matter which is which?

36:49.260 --> 36:50.722
How about the writer for us?

36:51.082 --> 36:52.844
Who's the writer, Nicole or Barbara?

36:54.486 --> 36:55.307
They're both writers.

36:55.327 --> 36:57.930
Do a little picture.

36:58.590 --> 36:59.151
Oh, that's nice.

36:59.571 --> 37:02.875
Oh, they'll love that.

37:02.895 --> 37:05.678
Do you have any favorites among your contemporaries?

37:06.974 --> 37:08.896
You mentioned Sendak earlier.

37:09.317 --> 37:10.478
Oh, yeah.

37:11.139 --> 37:15.363
I like Jim Marshall's books a lot.

37:16.064 --> 37:25.895
I appreciate other people who do humor well, and I like Rosemary Wells a lot, picture books.

37:26.396 --> 37:29.499
Kevin Hanks, he's a newer author.

37:29.559 --> 37:31.902
I like his stuff a lot.

37:33.029 --> 37:34.151
Daniel Pinkwater.

37:34.771 --> 37:45.326
And do you read them more or less as one who appreciates other work, or is it like a carpenter studying somebody else's technique in carpentry?

37:45.586 --> 37:52.836
Well, I read them to enjoy them, but hopefully something good will happen for me.

37:53.097 --> 37:56.101
I don't know if I absorb technique or not.

37:56.521 --> 37:59.926
I'm not sort of analyzing them from that.

37:59.946 --> 38:01.028
This is for Nicole.

38:01.468 --> 38:02.850
And I see no age range.

38:03.387 --> 38:04.749
C-O-L-E.

38:10.114 --> 38:11.256
Did you date it, too?

38:12.297 --> 38:13.538
I did in 96.

38:14.579 --> 38:17.342
Pre-TV.

38:19.965 --> 38:24.010
Barbara.

38:24.030 --> 38:26.553
And we would like to get a paperback of it.

38:26.613 --> 38:28.455
Yeah, we'll do that when we go downstairs.

38:28.535 --> 38:31.318
I'd like you to meet Laurie, too.

38:31.653 --> 38:34.476
Well, that's actually an area we haven't covered.

38:34.496 --> 38:42.185
Maybe you could tell us a little bit about the collaboration with your wife, because that is quite apart from the author.

38:42.625 --> 38:46.549
Yeah, nobody's really done that, which is nice.

38:49.112 --> 38:51.455
It's a part that I really enjoy.

38:51.495 --> 38:58.082
Right now we're working on a book about sex.

38:58.433 --> 39:00.515
sign the dinosaurs died for you.

39:00.795 --> 39:03.037
You can do that for Nick and Connie, how's that?

39:03.057 --> 39:04.699
Okay, yeah.

39:04.719 --> 39:05.459
That sounds good.

39:19.793 --> 39:22.055
Gee, it turned out to be a lovely day, didn't it?

39:22.255 --> 39:24.217
Yeah, this morning it was really gloomy.

39:25.778 --> 39:26.719
The light is great.

39:28.640 --> 39:31.444
How much light do you get during the course of the day?

39:31.464 --> 39:33.726
I mean, you must have really planned this to get that.

39:33.867 --> 39:37.732
In the summer, on a warm day, it really cooks up here.

39:38.593 --> 39:45.902
And when we gutted the whole thing, we put in central air conditioning, and I'm so happy that that's in here.

39:45.922 --> 39:49.226
And Lori downstairs, hers is cool.

39:49.406 --> 39:51.449
I mean, she can appreciate the warmth.

39:51.529 --> 39:54.613
We should be in, you know, reverse studio spaces.

39:55.252 --> 39:57.334
You should see her place where she works.

39:57.454 --> 39:58.736
It's very nice down there.

39:58.756 --> 40:00.057
I want to get a few pictures.

40:00.958 --> 40:01.779
Do you want me to?

40:01.979 --> 40:05.303
Sure, but I do want you to talk a little bit about working with your wife.

40:06.063 --> 40:06.204
Okay.

40:06.804 --> 40:07.965
Maybe why don't we do that first?

40:08.025 --> 40:08.386
All right.

40:08.546 --> 40:17.335
Well, the first collaboration we had was a book about television, now that I think of it.

40:18.396 --> 40:18.917
Television?

40:18.937 --> 40:19.658
Yeah.

40:20.058 --> 40:20.499
I met her.

40:20.539 --> 40:21.900
She was working at Harvard.

40:22.235 --> 40:34.087
with Howard Gardner at Project Zero and studying children and media and how the media made a difference about the way a child understood a story.

40:35.108 --> 40:47.601
And she was interested in picture books and how the illustrations made changes in children's imaging processes and

40:48.509 --> 40:50.651
I thought, wow, it's so amazing.

40:50.691 --> 41:01.063
Someone is actually interested in illustrations in the picture books, because at that time, in the early 70s, illustrators were not even getting credit on the spine of the book.

41:02.004 --> 41:03.345
They were just the author.

41:03.385 --> 41:09.092
And when you think about it, you publish some of these very slim texts without the pictures.

41:10.213 --> 41:12.976
It's not going to be really satisfying to a child.

41:13.617 --> 41:16.660
And I was so happy there was somebody who valued...

41:16.927 --> 41:19.490
the picture element of these stories.

41:20.292 --> 41:39.237
So I worked with them as a consultant for a while, and then we got to know each other, and that was very nice, because I was kind of resigned to being single again, and figured, you know, who's going to want me with these two wild little boys?

41:39.277 --> 41:46.427
So the first book we were thinking of doing was a book about...

41:46.795 --> 42:11.762
television and young children have a real hard time understanding that superheroes in particular aren't just real people playing a part and how a TV show is made that's a big mystery to little kids so we were trying to figure a way we could do this book and we were driving to an antique fair out at Brimfield well we live near Brimfield do you?

42:12.423 --> 42:16.127
oh you must hate that three times a year but it's great

42:16.580 --> 42:17.922
Oh, it's a wonderful place.

42:17.942 --> 42:19.764
We look forward to going there in May.

42:20.064 --> 42:27.273
And we were going, and we started talking about the show, and I said, well, I have this character on Arthur's Lunchbox called the Bionic Bunny.

42:27.353 --> 42:30.417
Maybe we could use him as the superhero.

42:30.917 --> 42:41.490
And then the more we talked, Lori was driving, and she was driving faster and faster and faster, and she got her first speeding ticket that day.

42:41.892 --> 42:44.216
But we got this great book.

42:45.117 --> 42:49.824
It was the start of a great collaboration and Bionic Bunny Show.

42:49.845 --> 42:52.489
And we use that a lot in the Arthur series, actually.

42:52.569 --> 42:54.692
Arthur's always watching the Bionic Bunny Show.

42:55.233 --> 42:59.800
So working as collaborators, though, I mean, do you more or less, is it symbiotic?

42:59.820 --> 43:03.466
Do you come up with the ideas together?

43:03.486 --> 43:07.933
Yeah, sometimes we come up with the subject matter we want to work on together.

43:08.403 --> 43:16.593
Or, you know, Laurie, right now, with this next book, she's dealing with friendship.

43:16.613 --> 43:35.997
It started out as kind of conflict resolutions, but she started to think about it, and it really is in the context of this larger framework of friendship, and it would be more helpful, really, to families to put it in that context.

43:36.348 --> 43:39.193
She knows what she wants to work with, and we talk about it.

43:39.213 --> 43:43.881
Something I'm really interested in illustrating, I think it will be great.

43:45.123 --> 43:57.203
And so now she's starting to do research, and she's reading as much as she can about it, and talking with professionals, people that deal with kids a lot, families.

43:58.285 --> 44:02.372
And so that thing is that it's very infancy.

44:02.960 --> 44:11.051
A book that she just finished that she's waiting for me to illustrate, and that's what I'm going to start this week, is a book about sex for young kids.

44:11.852 --> 44:18.681
And it's about gender and kind of, you know, what's important about gender for young boys and girls?

44:18.781 --> 44:21.165
Where are their differences?

44:21.225 --> 44:23.027
Where are their similarities?

44:23.750 --> 44:26.454
Again, it's another difficult topic.

44:26.474 --> 44:27.034
Preaching?

44:27.195 --> 44:28.016
You said young kids.

44:28.276 --> 44:29.337
Yeah, young kids.

44:29.357 --> 44:31.480
This is quite critical, what I'm talking about.

44:31.781 --> 44:33.563
Very young kids, I know it.

44:34.044 --> 44:39.050
How much information is important to give to a 5-, 6-, 7-, 8-year-old child?

44:41.133 --> 44:51.006
And again, she's worked with some really top-notch professionals and people who work with kids all the time saying, you know, we need a book.

44:51.323 --> 45:00.318
for this age group, covering these topics, because nothing else is really out there like that for kids.

45:01.841 --> 45:03.664
And we can't use the dinosaurs for that.

45:03.764 --> 45:04.526
I wanted to.

45:05.227 --> 45:08.893
And you'll see on Lori's studio door there are two little nude dinosaurs

45:09.447 --> 45:12.251
That's funny.

45:12.411 --> 45:16.496
You know, anatomically it could confuse the kids with the tails and everything.

45:19.360 --> 45:22.043
So we had to use actual people in this one.

45:22.063 --> 45:27.451
That's a very delicate area that you're... Yeah.

45:27.471 --> 45:29.593
No subject is taboo for us.

45:30.174 --> 45:30.915
How about religion?

45:31.435 --> 45:32.337
You talk about what's happening.

45:32.377 --> 45:35.525
Well, in Dinosaurs Die, there's a little bit of religion.

45:35.806 --> 45:40.858
That's one of the topics that we think that would be a very good subject for kids.

45:42.482 --> 45:44.126
I'd love to deal with that.

45:44.186 --> 45:47.133
There's no shortage of that.

45:47.474 --> 45:49.118
Let me shoot a few shots here.

45:49.158 --> 45:49.258
Okay.

45:49.441 --> 45:51.163
Where do you want to do that?

45:51.183 --> 45:52.544
I like the stuff over here.

45:53.145 --> 45:54.907
You're a big antique person?

45:55.267 --> 45:56.509
Oh, we love antique.

45:56.529 --> 45:57.530
Do you collect things?

45:57.730 --> 45:59.912
Yeah, I collect game boards.

46:00.173 --> 46:00.513
Do you?

46:00.773 --> 46:01.354
Yeah.

46:01.374 --> 46:03.376
Want to sit with those?

46:03.596 --> 46:04.838
You could sit with those Arthur's.

46:05.198 --> 46:06.539
Maybe Arthur and D.W.?

46:06.560 --> 46:08.862
Yeah, and then we'll maybe do it.

46:09.423 --> 46:10.384
This is kind of nice.

46:11.024 --> 46:13.607
Oh, if I can get that outdoor stuff.

46:13.627 --> 46:14.188
We'll try it.

46:16.510 --> 46:18.132
But the available light is not bad.

46:19.732 --> 46:23.936
I'm going to shoot a couple available like this, and then I'll shoot a couple flash.

46:24.977 --> 46:25.678
I love getting them.

46:25.698 --> 46:27.499
I can turn the lights on above here.

46:27.740 --> 46:31.363
Well, this is right on you, and it's at a 60th of a second, which is not bad.

46:32.444 --> 46:34.005
It's supposed to get good flash tones.

46:35.847 --> 46:36.468
Oh, good.

46:36.528 --> 46:37.909
They're coming in tight now.

46:42.153 --> 46:44.555
All right, now let's try to get a couple with the flash.

46:45.596 --> 46:48.439
I'll put these on, see if this is helpful or not.

46:49.921 --> 46:51.543
Yeah, oh, that'll be—oh, that's good.

46:51.563 --> 46:52.063
Is that better?

46:52.283 --> 46:52.483
Yeah.

46:53.004 --> 46:53.605
Okay.

46:53.625 --> 46:54.626
I just like this setting.

46:54.666 --> 46:58.710
I like it even better than the— Do you want to couple with the books if you like this here?

46:59.250 --> 47:02.513
This is really excellent, yeah.

47:02.753 --> 47:03.374
That's great.

47:07.378 --> 47:08.359
The flash went off there?

47:08.619 --> 47:08.939
Yeah.

47:09.080 --> 47:11.482
Yeah, that's what we want.

47:11.542 --> 47:17.047
Coming back now.

47:17.067 --> 47:19.069
Coming back further.

47:19.089 --> 47:19.810
I don't like that.

47:21.781 --> 47:24.748
Oh, D.W., get your hair out of your face.

47:28.215 --> 47:28.596
I didn't realize.

47:28.616 --> 47:30.941
I'll go back to this light.

47:35.612 --> 47:37.917
I've done pictures of authors before, and they said,

47:39.517 --> 47:41.800
Vanity Fair was just serious.

47:41.820 --> 47:42.701
You spent two hours.

47:42.761 --> 47:43.622
You did two minutes.

47:43.722 --> 47:45.925
And I said, you know, we're all looking for one.

47:47.107 --> 47:48.628
My shots are going to be just as good.

47:49.089 --> 47:52.173
Because we're all looking for one picture.

47:52.193 --> 47:53.595
That's really what it comes down to.

47:54.556 --> 47:57.119
Can I move something?

47:57.139 --> 47:58.741
No, I'm just moving around.

48:00.443 --> 48:01.685
Well, I love these animals.

48:01.905 --> 48:02.606
Okay.

48:06.451 --> 48:09.034
Oh.

48:12.862 --> 48:15.810
Oh, that's the woods back there.

48:15.850 --> 48:16.678
They almost look...
