WEBVTT

00:03.187 --> 00:17.145
Thank you.

00:22.593 --> 00:23.314
Hi, everybody.

00:23.374 --> 00:24.957
Welcome to The Book Guys.

00:25.077 --> 00:38.699
From Washington, D.C., in the studios of WAMU-FM, I'm Mike Cuthbert, along with Alan Stipek, the founder, president, and chief major-domo of Second Story Books, one of the largest bookstores in the Washington area, dealing in used books.

00:39.500 --> 00:41.544
And we're doing our thing with you, as usual.

00:41.644 --> 00:44.829
Our phone number is 1-800-828-BOOK.

00:45.350 --> 00:47.954
You call that number, and we get you on the air.

00:48.094 --> 00:49.917
Talking about used books, rare books,

00:50.234 --> 00:56.662
And as we head into the officially now, into the holiday season, Alan, first of all, good to see you again.

00:56.882 --> 00:57.062
Hello.

00:58.123 --> 01:02.469
As we head into the holiday season, it seems like the world is breaking out in book fairs.

01:02.549 --> 01:06.453
You can't open a book magazine or anything else without seeing a book fair someplace around the country.

01:07.054 --> 01:08.416
There are generally two kinds, it seems.

01:08.456 --> 01:12.080
There's the book fair, and then there's the international book fair.

01:12.120 --> 01:12.961
What's the difference?

01:12.981 --> 01:15.364
One is out of the country, the one is in the United States.

01:15.344 --> 01:18.291
But there's international fairs in the United States.

01:18.311 --> 01:18.833
What does that mean?

01:18.933 --> 01:19.675
Okay.

01:19.996 --> 01:24.567
What is happening is about two and a half years ago, book fairs exploded.

01:24.908 --> 01:30.021
There used to be one or two book fairs every week or every month.

01:30.041 --> 01:32.948
Now there's two or three book fairs every week.

01:32.928 --> 01:34.009
year-round.

01:34.050 --> 01:37.614
You literally could be in two cities every week of the year.

01:38.115 --> 01:39.857
Now, there are international book fairs.

01:39.937 --> 01:44.163
I'm a member of the ABAA, and we have five book fairs annually in the United States.

01:44.524 --> 01:51.954
We call them international book fairs because we are the American chapter of the ILAB, the International League of Antiquarian Booksellers.

01:52.614 --> 01:54.497
And we have our

01:54.477 --> 02:00.323
compatriots in other countries come and participate in our book fairs as we do with them in their country.

02:00.343 --> 02:05.768
So if you have an international book fair, let's say the Washington International Book Fair, what happens if no foreign dealers come?

02:05.788 --> 02:07.270
Is it still an international book fair?

02:07.370 --> 02:08.571
Well, we'll make one come over.

02:08.591 --> 02:11.714
We'll either pay their way, but we'll make sure we have one.

02:11.995 --> 02:12.956
We won't call it a bribe.

02:13.036 --> 02:14.978
Let's say it's an enhancement.

02:15.058 --> 02:15.678
Let's be honest.

02:15.798 --> 02:19.422
Because people go to book fairs and they think they're seeing used books, they might get a deal.

02:19.402 --> 02:24.188
If you're shopping for Christmas presents, is a used book fair the best place to get a real bargain?

02:24.348 --> 02:36.083
Well, if we're talking a used fair versus a rare book fair, you might be better off going to a local book fair, which generally just has booksellers from that specific area.

02:36.103 --> 02:44.734
When you go to one of the larger Enneagram book fairs, an ABA book fair, the chance of getting something which is mispriced is slim and none because these are the professionals in the field.

02:44.714 --> 02:46.757
and they're going to be very conscious.

02:46.857 --> 02:53.265
They're going to get some very good books, and you might get books which we'll appreciate, but it's going to be very rare when you're going to get a real mistake.

02:53.765 --> 03:00.353
If you're going specifically to book fairs to find the mistake, I suggest you go around the country to the local book fairs.

03:00.434 --> 03:06.982
If you can afford the travel expenses and you really like the world of book selling, these are the areas to go to.

03:07.622 --> 03:12.088
There's at least, and I'm not exaggerating, there's two book fairs every week in some part of the country.

03:12.997 --> 03:14.979
Our number is 1-800-828-BOOK.

03:14.999 --> 03:22.787
When you call that toll-free number, be sure you have your book with you so you can describe the author, the title, the publisher, and the year in which it was published.

03:22.887 --> 03:25.470
It helps us figure out which book you're talking about.

03:25.730 --> 03:28.293
That's 1-800-828-BOOK.

03:28.313 --> 03:32.237
That's the number that Arthur called, and Arthur's our first caller of the day.

03:32.457 --> 03:33.898
Arthur, welcome to the book, guys.

03:34.058 --> 03:35.079
Thank you.

03:35.099 --> 03:35.860
What have you got for us?

03:36.241 --> 03:39.544
Well, I've got two books, the same book.

03:39.912 --> 03:46.161
And it's For Whom the Bell Tolls by Ernest Hemingway, published by Scribner in 1940.

03:46.341 --> 03:54.793
One of them was mine originally, and the other one I picked up, I think, at a church book, not a church book fair, but a church fair.

03:55.815 --> 03:58.979
And I've been told that there's a difference in them.

04:00.502 --> 04:04.427
The jacket, incidentally, on either one is in very good shape.

04:05.108 --> 04:09.835
But one of them, and I don't remember who told me this,

04:10.287 --> 04:24.385
was that one is better than the other because the photograph of Hemingway on the back of the dust jacket is not credited by the photographer.

04:24.826 --> 04:27.269
And the other one is credited.

04:27.449 --> 04:28.050
That's correct.

04:28.371 --> 04:34.759
One of them on the copyright page has a small A underneath the credit line.

04:35.735 --> 04:38.568
And that's the only difference that I can see in them.

04:38.588 --> 04:42.808
And if this was pointed out to me, I wouldn't have even noticed it, I guess, if it hadn't been.

04:43.109 --> 04:46.435
But I'm just curious about what all this is about.

04:46.776 --> 04:48.940
Okay, let's go from the best to the least.

04:49.621 --> 04:53.989
Okay, For Whom the Bell Tolls was published by Scribner's in 1940.

04:54.550 --> 05:01.844
All books published by Scribner's after 1929 must have an A on the verso of the copyright page.

05:01.924 --> 05:02.585
What's the verso?

05:02.626 --> 05:06.653
The other side of the title to indicate a first edition.

05:06.633 --> 05:12.903
Now, books prior to that that were issued by Scribner sometimes would have to be weighed.

05:13.424 --> 05:22.640
I think The Sun Also Rises by Hemingway, the way you can tell at first, if it's 15 and a half ounces versus 15 ounces, which is a problem for booksellers when they're in the field.

05:22.660 --> 05:27.488
They've got to carry a small weight with them, you know, a scale with them to weigh the book out.

05:27.728 --> 05:32.556
But as far as For Whom the Bell Tolls, the first edition is Scribner's 1940 with the A.

05:32.536 --> 05:37.242
To make it the best you can have, you have to have a perfect dust jacket.

05:37.282 --> 05:41.547
The dust jacket cannot have the credit of the photographer on the back.

05:41.827 --> 05:46.813
So you need an A for a first and no credit on the back for it to be a true first wrapper.

05:46.933 --> 05:49.436
Now, excuse me, there's an obvious technique here.

05:49.677 --> 05:57.106
Arthur takes the A volume and the photograph of Hemingway without the author and matches them up.

05:57.166 --> 05:58.107
That's called mating.

05:58.127 --> 05:58.547
Yeah.

05:58.567 --> 05:58.727
Okay.

05:58.848 --> 05:59.749
That's legitimate?

05:59.989 --> 06:01.731
That's mating a book.

06:01.751 --> 06:02.492
I mean...

06:02.472 --> 06:10.287
I mean, if you lose sleep, but quite frankly, that's done all the time in book collecting.

06:10.628 --> 06:18.203
Booksellers and book collectors will collect a book to add to their collection, and they'll buy it at any level they can.

06:18.183 --> 06:26.057
at that specific time, and what they'll do is if the dust wrapper is in poor condition, they'll look to buy a better dust wrapper.

06:26.298 --> 06:29.664
The greatest example is the Great Gatsby.

06:29.684 --> 06:34.352
A first edition of Great Gatsby sells for, quite frankly, a perfect jacket for about $25,000.

06:34.332 --> 06:35.674
The book is worth $1,000.

06:36.054 --> 06:37.356
The jacket is worth $24,000.

06:37.656 --> 06:45.247
And if you want to get a perfect copy and you don't have a perfect jacket, you certainly are going to look for the better jacket.

06:45.267 --> 06:50.734
And I've seen jackets sell on their own, no exaggeration, for $20,000 without the book.

06:50.754 --> 06:52.637
That's an interesting purchase.

06:52.917 --> 07:02.450
I mean, we've sold jackets to booksellers who specialize in feels when we've had, like, Agatha Christie jackets without the book that they wanted to put on a good copy without a jacket.

07:02.470 --> 07:02.550
Wow.

07:02.530 --> 07:13.180
In this case, For Whom the Bell Tolls, in good condition, or meaning good, I say very good to fine, would be worth about $300 a first in jacket.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.081
Then it would go down the ladder.

07:15.502 --> 07:23.929
A book, a reading copy, a non-first edition with the later jacket, a book club jacket, would be worth about $15 max.

07:23.989 --> 07:27.813
There is a great disparity between the first and the subsequent editions.

07:28.954 --> 07:32.537
But you wouldn't be the first person on earth to...

07:32.517 --> 07:33.258
We lost him.

07:34.620 --> 07:34.720
Yeah.

07:34.740 --> 07:34.840
Yeah.

07:34.860 --> 07:42.309
Whoever, Arthur, wherever he went, he wouldn't be the first person on earth to take the jacket and put it on a first.

07:42.690 --> 07:44.272
For Arthur, the bell just told.

07:44.372 --> 07:44.492
Told.

07:44.512 --> 07:45.273
No question.

07:45.293 --> 07:46.294
Sorry about that, Arthur.

07:47.236 --> 07:49.478
You bring up the dust jacket.

07:49.879 --> 07:52.342
Why is a dust jacket so important to us now?

07:52.362 --> 07:52.863
Why is it so important?

07:53.223 --> 07:56.888
Because it is the original form the book was issued in.

07:57.368 --> 07:58.710
And unfortunately...

07:58.994 --> 08:13.051
For a lot of people who have had books, they've taken the dust wrapper and they've let it deteriorate, and they haven't realized that because of the fragile aspect of the jacket, it has taken the book from its original format and lowered it.

08:13.372 --> 08:15.314
That's what makes dust jackets so important.

08:15.354 --> 08:17.316
Now, dust jackets are relatively new.

08:17.336 --> 08:19.399
They've only been around for about 100 years.

08:19.379 --> 08:35.643
And during the early, during the, let's say, the flapper years when book novels became very popular, especially F. Scott Fitzgerald, the jackets were very important because the art on the jackets were, in fact, their own part of the book.

08:35.723 --> 08:42.653
They influenced the purchase of the book, and they were the image what the person wanted, the author wanted the book to represent.

08:43.274 --> 08:45.197
And a dust wrapper artist worth a lot of money.

08:45.638 --> 08:46.019
Fascinating.

08:46.059 --> 08:52.570
In fact, we'll get into in future programs something that's very scary happening in dust jackets, and that's color Xerox copies.

08:52.711 --> 08:53.833
Oh, no question.

08:53.853 --> 08:54.734
We'll talk about that later.

08:54.754 --> 08:55.956
For Whom the Bell Tolls is one of them.

08:55.977 --> 08:56.778
Yeah, exactly.

08:57.259 --> 08:59.202
Let's go to Charleston, South Carolina.

08:59.322 --> 09:00.825
Jane, you're on with the book, guys.

09:00.865 --> 09:01.907
What have you got for us?

09:02.056 --> 09:05.501
Well, I have no dust jackets, for sure.

09:05.521 --> 09:11.690
I have a two-volume of the sketchbook of Jeffrey Crayon.

09:11.710 --> 09:12.210
No kidding.

09:13.853 --> 09:18.039
But it never, in the entire book, tells one who wrote it.

09:18.059 --> 09:19.000
Washington Irving.

09:19.340 --> 09:21.403
I know who wrote it, but why don't they tell me that?

09:21.584 --> 09:22.545
Well, because...

09:22.863 --> 09:30.574
Well, actually, this was Washington Irving when he used the pseudonym of Jeffrey Crayon and didn't want anybody to know for a variety of reasons.

09:30.975 --> 09:35.541
One, I believe, is because he didn't want the royalties to go to his own name.

09:35.642 --> 09:38.125
He wanted to have the royalties somewhere else.

09:38.145 --> 09:43.793
Others had to do with the fact that he published in Europe, in England, before he published in the United States.

09:44.114 --> 09:49.141
And being a very famous American author, this had to do, again, with getting paid for the book.

09:49.181 --> 09:51.064
He had another bank account in England.

09:51.044 --> 09:53.008
It all has to do with money then.

09:53.248 --> 09:54.471
Some of it has to do with money.

09:54.491 --> 09:55.072
Even then.

09:55.132 --> 09:56.334
Even then, Jane.

09:56.976 --> 09:57.857
Oh, my.

09:58.338 --> 10:00.342
Are they worth anything, do you suppose?

10:00.442 --> 10:02.206
The first edition of the sketchbook?

10:02.226 --> 10:03.949
I don't know if it's the first edition or not.

10:04.029 --> 10:09.019
It says London, John Murray, Albemarle Street, 1823.

10:08.999 --> 10:10.623
Well, there's a good chance it is.

10:10.783 --> 10:13.749
If you want to do some vamping music for me, I can look it up.

10:15.814 --> 10:18.219
But that's about the right time for that book.

10:18.580 --> 10:25.455
Let's say, and I'm not sure if it is or not, it was a first, that book would sell, is it an original board or an original cloth?

10:26.195 --> 10:28.381
I don't know.

10:28.401 --> 10:29.965
It looks like it.

10:30.105 --> 10:36.582
The outside is the same as the inside of the cover, you know, that beautiful kind of watery thing.

10:36.902 --> 10:38.466
Oh, the kind of watery thing.

10:38.767 --> 10:39.629
Let's see, what are we thinking?

10:39.689 --> 10:40.692
What are we thinking?

10:40.772 --> 10:41.875
We're thinking...

10:41.855 --> 10:44.219
Watermarks, marbleized paper.

10:44.239 --> 10:45.400
Yes, marbleized paper.

10:45.621 --> 10:48.645
Are the covers leather-bound or are they cloth-bound?

10:48.686 --> 10:49.847
Leather-bound.

10:49.867 --> 10:50.188
Okay.

10:51.049 --> 11:00.724
Generally, first editions of Washington Irving or Godfrey Crayon were issued in cloth bindings, generally black or brown boards.

11:00.704 --> 11:05.953
Subsequent editions were done in leather, again, to make a deluxe edition.

11:06.294 --> 11:17.112
But to have a true first edition of Irving, you will find them in these very hard brown boards with, oh, how would I describe it?

11:17.132 --> 11:25.306
A kind of like paste down on the spine, a kind of buckram cloth, which would be fastened onto the boards.

11:25.326 --> 11:26.408
Yeah, that is not fit.

11:26.388 --> 11:27.009
No.

11:27.029 --> 11:35.083
But, I mean, the leather enhances specific editions, and I would imagine if you had a true first, I would price that book somewhere in the vicinity of $300 to $400.

11:35.103 --> 11:35.364
Uh-huh.

11:35.504 --> 11:37.688
But this is not fact.

11:38.409 --> 11:39.130
Okay.

11:39.190 --> 11:39.671
Okay.

11:39.711 --> 11:40.433
Thank you very much.

11:40.653 --> 11:41.314
Well, thank you.

11:41.474 --> 11:42.136
Thanks very much.

11:42.356 --> 11:42.757
Bye.

11:42.977 --> 11:47.485
From Charleston, we go to Duxbury, Massachusetts, and John,

11:47.802 --> 12:17.590
welcome to the book guys hello hi there fine how are you very good very interesting program thank you well i think this is really gonna really gonna go good uh i have two volumes uh call of a book called wilson's tales of the borders in the scotland i don't have a date on it it's a large book old-fashioned with a marbleized cover and a buckram spine it was printed by adam and company

12:17.755 --> 12:20.398
Paternostro in London, Gatehead on Time.

12:22.101 --> 12:32.214
It's a very large book, very old, and it's not the kind people like today, but it's most interesting to anybody's Scottish ancestry.

12:32.374 --> 12:32.755
Right.

12:32.775 --> 12:36.700
Is it the actual title Wilson's Borderlands?

12:40.304 --> 12:43.088
Wilson's Tales of the Border.

12:43.928 --> 12:45.811
There's a variety of editions.

12:45.851 --> 12:47.554
You don't have an exact date on that, right?

12:47.614 --> 12:48.256
There is no date.

12:48.336 --> 12:51.040
I can't find either of the copies.

12:51.101 --> 12:55.368
It was probably published somewhere between about 1840 and 1875.

12:55.669 --> 12:57.251
It feels that old.

12:57.492 --> 12:58.153
It feels that old?

12:59.295 --> 13:00.177
What's it smell like?

13:01.479 --> 13:03.001
It smells about that old.

13:03.022 --> 13:03.683
It smells very good.

13:03.823 --> 13:05.025
It smells like...

13:05.005 --> 13:07.570
Sometimes I smell that all.

13:07.590 --> 13:15.527
Well, no, actually, the reason I say that is because, I mean, a professional nose could smell the difference between an 18th century... Come on now.

13:15.547 --> 13:16.589
I'm serious.

13:16.609 --> 13:17.331
Oh, quite true.

13:17.431 --> 13:20.738
Yeah, between 18th century and 17th century paper in the ink.

13:21.259 --> 13:24.446
This ink I can smell is early 18th century.

13:24.606 --> 13:25.107
That's right.

13:25.127 --> 13:25.528
I mean...

13:25.508 --> 13:27.754
Can you take the month of the year by any chance?

13:27.774 --> 13:28.716
I beg your pardon?

13:29.037 --> 13:31.143
Can you get the month of the year?

13:31.163 --> 13:31.484
No, I can't.

13:31.504 --> 13:35.294
But I can tell you what distillery it came from.

13:35.875 --> 13:36.457
From where, sir?

13:37.439 --> 13:38.502
At any rate, that's the book.

13:38.522 --> 13:39.585
There are large books.

13:39.869 --> 13:42.652
It was given to me as a gift many years ago.

13:42.692 --> 13:43.813
Full leather binding?

13:44.073 --> 13:44.894
Full leather binding.

13:44.914 --> 13:45.054
Right.

13:45.234 --> 13:46.256
And two volumes?

13:46.376 --> 13:46.836
Two volumes.

13:46.956 --> 13:48.438
Extra illustrated by any chance?

13:48.458 --> 13:49.299
All illustrated.

13:49.439 --> 13:53.123
Illustrated in sort of an antique lithograph.

13:53.523 --> 13:54.364
Two-color.

13:54.584 --> 13:54.944
Okay.

13:55.205 --> 13:56.666
In an antique lithograph?

13:56.686 --> 13:59.349
Well, I would say that they're... Is it hand-colored by any chance?

13:59.990 --> 14:00.850
No, they're not colored.

14:00.890 --> 14:01.671
They're two-color.

14:01.831 --> 14:02.552
Well, they're two-toned.

14:02.612 --> 14:05.415
So that could be a steel engraving by some chance?

14:05.435 --> 14:06.776
Does it look like an engraving?

14:06.897 --> 14:08.058
I happen to be an artist.

14:08.078 --> 14:09.319
I'll tell you, some are...

14:09.822 --> 14:13.126
engravings, but the others look to me like lithographs.

14:13.266 --> 14:14.448
Look like lithographs.

14:14.708 --> 14:15.869
They're taken off a stone.

14:15.889 --> 14:24.420
Well, then probably that's later than 1870, because 1850 is about the time that photo reproduction of lithographs came into existence.

14:24.881 --> 14:32.590
And so the fact that it looks like it's a lithograph, but it's a reproduction, I would imagine that book is probably later than 1860, 1865.

14:32.570 --> 14:39.156
which makes it a later edition, and I would guesstimate that without seeing the book, it would be worth anywhere between $75 to $150 for this sale.

14:39.456 --> 14:45.121
Well, it's a great book, and I was most interested in your comments in any case.

14:45.402 --> 14:46.402
John, thank you very much.

14:46.483 --> 14:47.063
Fascinating.

14:47.283 --> 14:47.824
My pleasure.

14:47.844 --> 14:50.226
It's fascinating to listen to you too, Matt.

14:50.246 --> 14:50.646
Thank you very much.

14:50.666 --> 14:50.846
Bye-bye.

14:50.866 --> 15:01.516
We'll talk more about the value of woodcuts, illustrations, lithographs, and all that to books that you might think are supposed to be most valuable just for their printing as the book guys continue.

15:01.556 --> 15:02.577
We're the book guys.

15:32.881 --> 15:34.743
We're the Book Guys in Washington.

15:34.863 --> 15:40.230
I'm Mike Cuthbert along with Alan Stipek as we take a look at your used books.

15:40.250 --> 15:42.953
Our number is 1-800-828-BOOK.

15:42.973 --> 15:48.300
All your questions will be answered there, and that's how you get on this radio program to be heard around the country.

15:48.841 --> 15:55.929
All you have to have is the author, the title, the publisher, and hopefully the year, though sometimes that's difficult.

15:55.949 --> 16:02.297
As you just heard Alan do, if we don't have a date of publication, he'll try to track it down for you from some other evidence.

16:02.277 --> 16:05.363
We were talking about lithographs, woodcuts and all the rest.

16:05.844 --> 16:11.796
What value are they, particularly when the book is supposed to be famous because it's, let's say, a novel by Dickens or anyone else?

16:12.177 --> 16:15.483
What is the importance of the art in those books?

16:15.624 --> 16:17.788
Oh, it's highly important, depending on...

16:17.768 --> 16:25.400
The book itself, I mean, a wonderful example is the Limited Editions Club comes out with a book.

16:25.600 --> 16:32.570
It started in 1929, and every other month they illustrated, they issued a classic with a special illustration.

16:32.590 --> 16:43.607
And the two greatest books in that series are the Lissistrata by Aristophanes, illustrated by Pablo Picasso, which now sells for about $3,000.

16:43.587 --> 16:50.240
And the Matisse Illustrated Ulysses, signed by both Matisse and James Joyce, which sells for about $8,000.

16:50.641 --> 16:56.071
So obviously, if you didn't have the Matisse Illustrations in that Ulysses, you wouldn't have an $8,000 book.

16:56.492 --> 16:56.933
All right.

16:57.193 --> 16:58.776
Let's go to Cincinnati.

16:58.796 --> 17:00.279
Hazel, you're on with the book, guys.

17:00.339 --> 17:00.961
Welcome to you.

17:01.722 --> 17:02.203
Good evening.

17:02.403 --> 17:02.564
Hi.

17:03.566 --> 17:04.347
What have you got for us?

17:04.647 --> 17:06.449
Well, mostly children's books.

17:06.809 --> 17:06.909
Okay.

17:06.929 --> 17:10.253
I just wondered if there was any value in those.

17:10.273 --> 17:13.397
Children's books are a wonderful, wonderful area to collect.

17:13.417 --> 17:17.841
The only unfortunate thing about collecting children's books is that you can't let your children look at them.

17:18.242 --> 17:19.824
No, no.

17:19.844 --> 17:21.185
Because they're not allowed to touch them.

17:21.405 --> 17:32.157
I have two daughters who probably have 3,000 books in their library at this point, of which maybe five are collectible because I can't allow them at their age to actually handle the books.

17:32.137 --> 17:34.800
Well, as a matter of fact, Hazel, there's a book out.

17:34.820 --> 17:38.463
In fact, we're going to hear from the author of it, Nick Basbanes, a little bit later.

17:38.884 --> 17:43.989
He talks about a woman down in Florida who was perhaps the most famous collector of children's books in the world.

17:44.409 --> 17:46.291
She headed the library where they were stored.

17:46.632 --> 17:50.516
She would not allow children to even touch the books that she had.

17:51.036 --> 17:52.398
So, so much for children's books.

17:52.418 --> 17:54.580
But what do you have in your library you'd like to check out?

17:54.740 --> 18:00.726
Well, I have one book, which is poems to be memorized and studied.

18:01.263 --> 18:05.409
It gives the poems that each grade they would need to learn.

18:06.691 --> 18:08.233
Now, is that a textbook?

18:08.253 --> 18:10.136
It's more like a textbook, yes.

18:10.276 --> 18:11.959
And when was it published, ma'am?

18:12.099 --> 18:15.063
19... 1925.

18:16.325 --> 18:17.287
And is it illustrated?

18:18.048 --> 18:18.288
No.

18:19.009 --> 18:19.229
No.

18:19.430 --> 18:20.371
And who is it published by?

18:20.411 --> 18:23.035
It's published by...

18:23.808 --> 18:25.711
Lincoln School Supply Company?

18:25.871 --> 18:27.153
That's a textbook.

18:27.173 --> 18:27.794
Okay.

18:27.814 --> 18:34.203
Okay, that is not, of all the world of children's books, that's probably one of the only ones that really doesn't have any market value.

18:34.543 --> 18:34.924
Okay.

18:35.505 --> 18:36.646
Okay.

18:36.666 --> 18:38.108
Is that a polite way of saying it?

18:38.128 --> 18:41.072
That's a polite way of saying it, but it's fun to read it.

18:41.213 --> 18:41.994
Oh, no question.

18:42.875 --> 18:43.656
To see what...

18:43.990 --> 18:47.054
children were expected to memorize.

18:47.875 --> 18:59.990
You know, the interesting thing about children's books, if you go back to school primers and the early chapbooks, you'll find that the earlier books are worth some money because they're the first books that were used in schools.

19:00.250 --> 19:03.855
But at school, Texas, you know,

19:03.835 --> 19:12.646
evolved, those books actually are of no value, and the books that are of value are the ones which were extra illustrated or are in some way enhanced by bindings.

19:12.967 --> 19:19.095
And it seems kind of disproportionate that the books which were most important for children look to be not collectible.

19:19.115 --> 19:20.276
Like the ones Hazel's talking about.

19:20.296 --> 19:23.781
Exactly, and the ones that are collectible are the books that you wouldn't allow your child to look at.

19:23.841 --> 19:27.626
Or you had to do under supervision.

19:27.666 --> 19:28.907
Did you have another one, Hazel?

19:29.007 --> 19:33.353
I also have Little Red Riding Hood, and this is illustrated.

19:34.531 --> 19:39.241
And it's published in, I had the page a moment ago, 1921.

19:39.965 --> 19:40.609
Mm-hmm.

19:40.775 --> 19:42.157
by Donahue and Company.

19:42.177 --> 19:42.297
Right.

19:42.797 --> 19:44.540
That unfortunately is a reprint house.

19:44.920 --> 19:50.727
Winston, Donahue, Grasset and Dunlap are all reprint houses.

19:50.767 --> 19:57.195
Hearst, that took children's classics and made, and I hate to use the expression again, poor man's or cheap editions.

19:57.756 --> 19:57.956
Okay.

19:58.016 --> 20:00.579
And that is exactly what that is.

20:00.879 --> 20:04.864
There are some wonderful Little Red Riding Hood books that are of value.

20:05.225 --> 20:07.187
You could go back to...

20:07.167 --> 20:14.157
the early forms of lithography, and you'll find children's books that just the lithographs alone are worth about $50 a page.

20:14.177 --> 20:21.407
And I like to say there are a lot of children's book illustrators out there that are so collectible that you're talking in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.

20:21.707 --> 20:27.355
I mean, Arthur Rackham, Edmund Duloc, or Willie Pagani, just names I'll throw out, but there's hundreds of them.

20:27.495 --> 20:28.637
Hazel, thanks for your call.

20:28.657 --> 20:29.939
We really appreciate it.

20:29.959 --> 20:30.059
Okay.

20:30.079 --> 20:30.520
Thank you, now.

20:30.700 --> 20:34.305
We're the book guys at 1-800-828-BOOK.

20:34.707 --> 20:43.540
I was fascinated to find the other day that one of the more collectible books recently has been Raggedy Ann and Andy, which is coming back.

20:44.221 --> 20:47.626
I found out it was also for Johnny Gruul's originals, but also the plates.

20:47.847 --> 20:51.712
In fact, we want to talk about that after the break coming up a little bit.

20:52.153 --> 20:59.584
The value of breaking books and just taking the plates out of them, I know you've got some strong feelings about that, and we'll find out what they are.

20:59.564 --> 21:05.039
I'm talking to Alan Stipek, I'm Mike Cuthbert, and we're the book guys in Washington.

21:06.964 --> 21:08.789
Alan, let's talk about what we got a second.

21:09.070 --> 21:11.215
What is your feeling about breaking of books?

21:12.318 --> 21:13.281
What's my feeling about it?

21:13.301 --> 21:13.502
Yeah.

21:13.863 --> 21:14.805
I think it's a felony.

21:15.629 --> 21:16.911
Okay.

21:17.171 --> 21:20.194
I quite frankly think there is no place for breaking books.

21:21.236 --> 21:24.059
If you have a book, the integrity of the book should be maintained.

21:24.520 --> 21:36.334
If a book was so destroyed and so disrepaired that the only thing that was obtainable out of it was the plates, then I could possibly agree that you should at least frame those.

21:36.694 --> 21:40.239
But nobody should ever extract a plate out of a book if the book is intact.

21:40.339 --> 21:42.601
I mean, that's not what the book was issued for.

21:42.661 --> 21:43.002
Fair enough.

21:43.022 --> 21:43.122
Yeah.

21:43.102 --> 21:44.664
Let's go to Susan.

21:44.744 --> 21:46.427
You're on with the book, guys.

21:46.607 --> 21:47.107
How are you?

21:48.269 --> 21:48.830
Hello, Susan.

21:48.990 --> 21:49.330
Oh, yes.

21:49.691 --> 21:50.152
Fine, thanks.

21:50.172 --> 21:50.772
It's your turn.

21:51.574 --> 22:04.872
I'm calling to... I don't have all the information I'm supposed to have to ask the question I have, but I have an old book that was given to me by my father and passed down to him by his mother.

22:05.332 --> 22:09.598
It's a volume of all of Shakespeare's plays, and...

22:09.950 --> 22:20.120
according to the little note in the book, was brought over by my grandmother's father in 1848 from England.

22:20.741 --> 22:32.132
The Shakespeare on the front of the book is spelled S-H-A-K-S-P-E-R-E, not the spelling we learn in college these days.

22:33.653 --> 22:35.995
And the type is probably about six points.

22:36.736 --> 22:37.977
The book is in terrible shape.

22:37.997 --> 22:39.619
The questions I really have are,

22:39.953 --> 22:44.863
And the book has enormous value to me just because I remember my grandmother reading this.

22:44.883 --> 22:46.266
She remembers her own father reading it.

22:46.286 --> 22:50.615
And she knew Shakespeare and loved Shakespeare so well.

22:52.118 --> 22:59.312
So my question, I would like to know how I might find out something about the history of this book's printing, since it would have been printed sometime later.

22:59.984 --> 23:03.110
presumably in the 19th century, and how I might preserve it.

23:03.390 --> 23:03.631
Okay.

23:03.711 --> 23:07.659
Well, question one is, who's the printer or the publisher on the title page?

23:07.839 --> 23:10.724
The really pathetic thing is the title page is missing.

23:10.764 --> 23:11.746
There's no colophon.

23:12.127 --> 23:12.728
Okay.

23:12.808 --> 23:16.896
It's probably, and I don't say this to detract from the value of the book,

23:16.876 --> 23:23.204
Shakespeare is probably the most published or printed book other than the Bible and the history of the world.

23:23.665 --> 23:29.372
The chance of it being a very early Shakespeare would be indicated by the paper.

23:29.473 --> 23:37.483
I mean, if you say it was handed down from your grandmother and you know it's at least as early as 1845, you've still got about another 200 years.

23:37.463 --> 23:40.649
before you're going all the way down to the folios.

23:40.809 --> 23:47.221
I'm just going to say that if it's just a regular reading copy, it's of no monetary value for resale.

23:47.521 --> 23:53.091
But from a personal perspective, to get it preserved, I highly agree that it should be maintained.

23:53.392 --> 23:55.135
And it is not...

23:55.115 --> 24:02.768
advantageous generally to rebound books for value because it usually detracts unless you're trying to protect the interior of the book.

24:02.788 --> 24:09.880
But in this case, because of your desire to maintain the keepsake, I would say go with whatever you want to do with it.

24:10.220 --> 24:17.933
I mean, it's not a question of money is no object, but you can make any kind of binding you want, and the book is more important to you because it's a family heirloom.

24:17.953 --> 24:19.536
Is there a binding on it now, Susan?

24:19.752 --> 24:24.604
There is a front and a cover but the spine is missing.

24:24.624 --> 24:24.865
Right.

24:25.807 --> 24:27.231
Is it leather bound or is it cloth?

24:27.371 --> 24:27.953
Leather.

24:27.973 --> 24:28.735
Yeah.

24:28.775 --> 24:31.602
Can you tell what kind of leather it is?

24:31.953 --> 24:33.756
You mean the color or, I mean, it's reddish?

24:33.917 --> 24:34.478
It's reddish.

24:34.518 --> 24:36.642
Reddish would probably be later.

24:36.662 --> 24:45.438
I mean, if there was a certain kind of, if the binding had different coloration, I might say it could be earlier, but a red leather binding usually doesn't start until about 1770.

24:45.558 --> 24:48.203
Well, and the engravings in it look like lithography.

24:48.223 --> 24:50.207
They don't look very early to me.

24:50.227 --> 24:52.932
Well, lithography or photo reproduction?

24:53.570 --> 24:55.696
I would say they look like engravings, right?

24:55.716 --> 24:56.559
Is that lithography?

24:56.880 --> 24:57.120
No.

24:57.461 --> 24:59.608
Well, lithography on stone engravings is different.

25:00.009 --> 25:01.774
I would say you probably have an early 1800s.

25:01.814 --> 25:03.018
Hang on just a second.

25:03.038 --> 25:08.153
We'll settle this in just a minute as we remind our listeners we're the Book Guys in Washington.

25:08.487 --> 25:10.932
We have dealt with Susan's Shakespeare.

25:11.714 --> 25:12.896
Who does rebinding?

25:12.917 --> 25:13.839
Where would she take it?

25:13.859 --> 25:14.640
Who does rebinding?

25:14.660 --> 25:16.284
There are book binders all around the country.

25:16.344 --> 25:28.470
I think depending on where you're calling from, I would just get in touch with a local chamber of commerce or look on the Yellow Pages or contact a local library or a museum and see who does their rebinding work.

25:28.450 --> 25:30.153
And that would be your best bet.

25:30.373 --> 25:31.114
Where are you calling from?

25:31.475 --> 25:32.056
Washington.

25:32.076 --> 25:32.577
Washington.

25:32.997 --> 25:33.819
Check the Yellow Pages.

25:33.839 --> 25:36.002
I mean, there's four or five binders in the area.

25:36.363 --> 25:39.368
One of the problems about good binders are they're backed up for years.

25:40.049 --> 25:45.818
And, you know, sometimes they don't have the time to, you know, not because they don't want to, but they have previous responsibilities.

25:45.798 --> 25:52.750
I would just check binders in the Washington area and see what they suggest and bring the book on it.

25:53.251 --> 25:54.794
You can also have a box made or something.

25:54.814 --> 25:55.054
Oh, sure.

25:55.074 --> 25:57.679
You can have clamshell boxes, cylinder boxes.

25:57.739 --> 26:00.264
You can have slip cases, a variety of ways to do it.

26:00.644 --> 26:02.828
And each of them could be special on your own right.

26:02.808 --> 26:11.019
I mean, one of the nicest things about book collecting is that you can actually create a protective box according to whatever you want to do.

26:11.079 --> 26:21.273
And I mean, if you went down and studied just the bindings, especially the French bindings from the 1920s, and saw what they did with the clam boxes, with the clam shake boxes, it is incredible.

26:21.494 --> 26:22.515
Those are works of art.

26:22.735 --> 26:25.339
And those works of art sell for thousands of dollars.

26:25.319 --> 26:28.043
I mean, you could design your own box if you wanted.

26:28.344 --> 26:29.906
Put a picture of your grandmother on it.

26:30.047 --> 26:31.729
I mean, seriously, I'm not saying that to be facetious.

26:31.890 --> 26:32.831
No, I was thinking the same thing.

26:32.851 --> 26:37.278
Yeah, I mean, you could do it, I mean, just off the top of my head, you could do little miniatures and actually paint them.

26:37.739 --> 26:41.305
I mean, that's not an, you know, it's something that would be wonderful.

26:41.325 --> 26:44.771
So you've got something to make, Susan.

26:44.791 --> 26:45.812
Thanks for your call.

26:45.973 --> 26:46.534
Thanks a lot.

26:46.554 --> 26:47.615
Thank you.

26:47.876 --> 26:48.036
Bye-bye.

26:48.016 --> 26:53.501
As we talked to you last week, we're going to be joined every week by Nicholas Basbanes.

26:53.701 --> 26:59.827
Nick is the author of A Gentle Madness, about book collecting, a lot of the people that we're talking with and about tonight.

27:00.487 --> 27:06.873
And as we join Nick tonight on Mars, he sounds like he's shaving again.

27:06.973 --> 27:12.278
We're going to hear the story tonight, I understand, Nick, of Nicholas Basbanes meets Michael Crichton.

27:12.318 --> 27:14.219
Tell us all about it.

27:14.760 --> 27:17.162
Michael Crichton, of course, I've interviewed...

27:17.412 --> 27:22.797
about four times over the years for Jurassic Park, a couple books prior to that.

27:22.917 --> 27:36.468
But in September, when his new book, his new novel, The Lost World, which is the sequel to Jurassic Park, was published, I went down to Long Island where he was visiting his old high school, Roslyn High School.

27:37.029 --> 27:40.252
To make a long story short, he was visiting with the students.

27:40.292 --> 27:41.192
They mobbed him.

27:41.232 --> 27:44.615
They all had copies of his book, which they asked to sign.

27:44.635 --> 27:46.677
We have to realize that this book was

27:47.028 --> 27:50.832
issued in the first printing of perhaps a half a million or 600,000 copies.

27:51.173 --> 27:53.375
Not a scarce book, perhaps a collectible book.

27:54.356 --> 27:57.800
But while he was there, they put up these little posters on the wall.

27:58.441 --> 28:04.248
Michael Crichton, welcome back to RHS, and it showed his little high school photograph.

28:04.969 --> 28:11.196
I took one of these off the wall, and as Michael was walking back out to his limo, I was walking with him, and I said, Michael, will you sign this for me?

28:12.053 --> 28:13.695
He looked at me and said, Nick, you son of a gun.

28:13.715 --> 28:15.558
I said, how many others have signed this thing today?

28:15.578 --> 28:17.641
He said, this is the only one.

28:18.042 --> 28:29.378
I don't know what the value of this thing is, but if there are half a million copies of The Lost World and only one signed copy of this poster, welcome back to RHS, dated on the day he was there.

28:29.899 --> 28:37.470
You know, this is a little piece of ephemera, but I think it's the kind of thing that collectors can look for, and if they see the opportunity to see something like that,

28:37.838 --> 28:38.639
Boy, go for it.

28:39.079 --> 28:40.461
Let me ask a question, Nick.

28:40.481 --> 28:45.326
After you realized he hadn't signed any others, did you go back and rip up all the other ones on the wall?

28:45.827 --> 28:47.249
No, actually, I ran to my car.

28:47.269 --> 28:49.852
I don't want anybody to see what I had.

28:50.212 --> 28:57.921
Actually, that's one of the greatest things about collecting is the oddity, the ephemeral oddity, which becomes the most desirable of any collector.

28:57.981 --> 29:05.830
I mean, there are so many authors, and you know that, Nick, that the scarcest piece is the one in five that was written while they were in college.

29:05.850 --> 29:06.090
Exactly.

29:06.070 --> 29:12.559
I did a mimeographed copy of something Ken Follett wrote in college, and I had him sign it for me, and he asked me, what's it worth?

29:12.619 --> 29:13.821
I said, now it's worth $2,000.

29:13.841 --> 29:17.827
And he looked at me, and he said the same thing, you son of a gun.

29:17.847 --> 29:18.628
Oh, good thinking.

29:18.648 --> 29:20.591
Nick, thanks very much for joining us tonight.

29:20.691 --> 29:21.472
Gentlemen, good luck.

29:21.492 --> 29:22.393
Thanks, Nick.

29:22.413 --> 29:22.734
Bye-bye.

29:22.874 --> 29:27.741
Nick Bazbaines, author of A Gentle Madness, published by Henry Holt.

29:27.721 --> 29:34.829
We're going to be talking about ephemera, but also about a set of presidential papers upcoming as the Book Guys continue.

29:34.849 --> 29:36.516
And we're the Book Guys.
