I was just mentioning Marvin, and he said he tried to retire a couple of years ago.

00:09.091 --> 00:11.714
I convinced him he had the best job in the store.

00:12.335 --> 00:15.478
He goes out and buys the private collections.

00:15.498 --> 00:25.390
He decides when and where he goes, what libraries he'll look at, decides which ones he'll buy, does it at his own pace, and doesn't have to worry too much about it.

00:25.410 --> 00:26.992
Tell me a little bit about his background.

00:27.012 --> 00:29.195
Was he part of the Fourth Avenue culture?

00:29.215 --> 00:33.700
Well, he actually started working for my dad when I went into the Army.

00:34.405 --> 00:37.669
And when I came back, I think he went into the Merchant Marine.

00:38.090 --> 00:50.807
So there was a gap, and then he worked for us for a while, started his own business, and worked again, I think, for us, and then went to Belgium for a couple of years, then came back, and he's been with us ever since.

00:50.827 --> 00:53.311
And he is a resource for us, isn't he?

00:53.331 --> 00:53.511
Oh, yeah.

00:53.812 --> 00:59.078
extremely knowledgeable, probably knows more about rare books than anybody else.

00:59.258 --> 01:02.162
I doubt, really, that you'd have that operation without Marvin.

01:02.182 --> 01:03.583
You might have less sense.

01:03.603 --> 01:09.250
Well, I've got Craig, Vassell, Scott in there, and I've got three guys who have really picked up on them.

01:09.270 --> 01:11.032
Craig is excellent.

01:11.052 --> 01:11.452
Craig's terrific.

01:11.472 --> 01:11.572
Yeah.

01:11.592 --> 01:17.439
I mean, but they each cover slightly different fields of that overlap, and they're good.

01:17.639 --> 01:20.022
Craig is top-notch on them, too.

01:20.255 --> 01:20.796
Craig Anderson.

01:21.218 --> 01:22.521
No, I know Craig.

01:22.962 --> 01:26.472
C-R-A-I-G and A-N-D-E-R-S-O-N.

01:26.532 --> 01:29.099
But we have about two and a half million books in here.

01:29.119 --> 01:29.921
I think that was the number.

01:30.141 --> 01:33.370
How many books do you think you moved through the store?

01:33.873 --> 01:34.754
You know, I don't know.

01:35.074 --> 01:37.877
One thing, I'm sort of superstitious.

01:37.897 --> 01:40.780
I'm counting numbers and customers or what we're selling.

01:41.281 --> 01:45.385
I just, you know, I don't know, and I really don't want to know.

01:45.405 --> 01:48.027
Sometimes I estimate how many boxes of books have gone out.

01:48.788 --> 01:54.374
But then I get a little bit further because I find out, I thought we sold about 50 boxes of books.

01:54.394 --> 01:59.619
But we're going to 65, so... You know, I've got a 130.

01:59.639 --> 02:00.420
I've got a...
