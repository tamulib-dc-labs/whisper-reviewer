WEBVTT

00:03.575 --> 00:32.923
and give some sense of the literature, the tremendous literature, both book cultural literature, the history of book cultural literature, and also the enumerative bibliography, which is a separate issue that has been written in a variety of languages about

00:35.131 --> 00:39.678
books, bookmen, libraries in that part of the world.

00:42.583 --> 01:00.312
And then maybe thirdly, to give some sense of how after 1989, this world

01:01.912 --> 01:31.412
that had existed for 70 some odd years in Russia and former Soviet Union and for a shorter time in Eastern Europe, kind of socialist or communist dominated world, how this came apart and what the influence or the impact was of this on book culture, on literate culture, on scholarship,

01:37.096 --> 01:53.500
It's a very dramatic story.

01:53.520 --> 02:04.656
And how all of these lives, thousands of people, tens of thousands,

02:05.885 --> 02:35.487
librarians, bibliographers, writers, how their lives have really been completely, you know, it's as if, you know, you're standing on a... Completely devolved, completely destroyed, after investing, you know, 40 or 50 years in a discipline.

02:36.192 --> 02:45.023
and then to see that whole world in which you were a functioning part completely unraveled.

02:47.466 --> 03:04.647
For example, Zeit said... Then you said, it's almost as if... It's almost as if you had been standing on some pedestal or on some mount, and someone comes along and rudely kicks the pedestal, and you fall, and everything that

03:05.032 --> 03:12.421
that you're holding these precious cultures off somehow just, you know, devolves.

03:12.441 --> 03:17.988
It's a very, I've seen so many lives, colleagues of mine.

03:18.008 --> 03:24.216
For example, you have, you know, someone like Professor Fadier of Moscow University here.

03:27.100 --> 03:29.042
Let's see where I can quickly get one of her.

03:30.243 --> 03:32.266
I think I'm on track here.

03:33.067 --> 03:33.908
This is very good.

03:35.727 --> 03:41.236
The context here, I see it very good.

03:41.256 --> 03:47.505
But in any case, some of these books are double stuck.

03:47.525 --> 04:03.490
But here is a woman who has spent a significant portion of her life studying the book, the manuscript and printed book,

04:06.288 --> 04:13.836
And she was getting government subsidies to do her various travels and so on.

04:16.099 --> 04:17.961
Has a doctorate in the field.

04:19.643 --> 04:26.630
Is considered one of the world's premier specialists in 17th century Russian book culture.

04:26.650 --> 04:34.759
And now, given other economic interests and other forces,

04:35.296 --> 04:41.743
that are going on in that part of the world, she's become completely marginalized.

04:41.763 --> 04:48.330
So you could have a stack of books this high, and all of a sudden, you're nothing.

04:48.350 --> 04:50.151
Your salary has disappeared.

04:50.592 --> 04:54.336
You have no savings, because most Eastern European people, they have no savings.

04:54.876 --> 05:00.402
They don't have, you know, sumptuous apartments, they don't have, you know, antiques.

05:00.422 --> 05:02.164
So, for example, Padyeva has

05:02.903 --> 05:06.627
You know, 35,000 books in her private library.

05:06.648 --> 05:08.269
35,000.

05:09.070 --> 05:13.996
You can't even look into her apartment because everybody... She's a professor at Moscow University.

05:14.016 --> 05:16.159
She was a consultant to New York Public Library.

05:18.862 --> 05:19.843
What's her name again?

05:21.786 --> 05:23.768
You have to meet her at some point.

05:24.409 --> 05:31.898
P-O-Z-D-E-E-V-A.

05:33.312 --> 05:36.736
And what's her first name?

05:36.796 --> 05:37.176
Irina.

05:38.377 --> 05:38.558
Irina.

05:38.638 --> 05:38.938
I-I-N-A.

05:39.018 --> 05:39.278
Right.

05:41.401 --> 05:46.006
And here is a woman who... She's in Moscow now?

05:46.126 --> 05:48.028
In Moscow, at Moscow University.

05:48.048 --> 05:48.909
We're in the center of town.

05:51.552 --> 06:03.184
And desperately needs Western support, Western financial, that's what, to keep, to keep going.

06:06.995 --> 06:32.985
And so for a second time in this century, first time after the Revolution, where you have this tremendous absolute realignment, I wrote an article called The Old Cadres in Service of the Revolution, where incunabulus, like Malaya, were great professors before the Revolution,

06:34.265 --> 06:39.932
after the revolution, his German, Latin, his tremendous erudition, Greek, and so on.

06:41.615 --> 06:43.217
We don't need this stuff.

06:43.237 --> 06:46.181
We need people who are going to work in the factories.

06:46.201 --> 06:48.323
The hell with your Greek and Latin.

06:48.343 --> 06:49.885
You're going into the library.

06:50.186 --> 06:53.951
You're no longer going to be exposed to students because we don't trust you politically.

06:54.271 --> 06:55.873
You're going to catalog books.

06:55.893 --> 06:56.874
Is that what they did to have?

06:56.894 --> 06:57.375
Exactly.

06:57.455 --> 06:58.136
You have this?

06:58.156 --> 06:58.577
Of course.

06:58.597 --> 07:00.299
This is one of the essays?

07:00.359 --> 07:01.060
One of the essays.

07:01.100 --> 07:02.001
I'll give you that, too.

07:02.582 --> 07:04.204
But my point is,

07:04.825 --> 07:26.716
that here again, second time in this century, that you have this very abrupt change of values in the society, where erudition, book learning, book culture, now is the emphasis, do you know English?

07:27.577 --> 07:33.145
If you know English, you're going to work in a bank, you're going to be a typist, you're going to be a computer processor,

07:33.462 --> 07:35.365
And the hell with all of this stuff?

07:35.385 --> 07:38.168
Okay, so who is this fellow now that they threw him into the law?

07:38.409 --> 07:40.512
Malayan, the great professor before.

07:40.532 --> 07:42.194
How do you spell his name?

07:42.795 --> 07:44.237
M-A-L-E-I-N.

07:44.617 --> 07:47.501
And then in the 30s, when he was working on the gazelle.

07:47.521 --> 07:48.743
Let me just jump back here.

07:49.584 --> 08:00.740
Now, this guy clearly pissed some people off, because you're telling me about some other people, and they didn't make any waves, and they were allowed to keep their libraries and their collections.

08:01.240 --> 08:03.283
So why did this guy all of a sudden

08:03.517 --> 08:09.062
with his great audition and his great scholarship, why did they single him out and say, we don't need you?

08:09.203 --> 08:22.135
I think that they did not, many intellectuals who did, they did not trust politically, because they may have come from a religious background, they may have, as I said, their parents may have been religious.

08:22.155 --> 08:22.796
You see what I'm saying?

08:22.976 --> 08:30.363
He's clearly one that wasn't protected in the manner in which you described earlier.

08:30.383 --> 08:31.144
Let me say,

08:32.103 --> 08:50.340
We're talking about the period just after the revolution, where people are very concerned about issues of political reliability, about political security of the regime.

08:52.201 --> 08:59.308
And they did not want a person who was educated in the ethos of the old regime in front of students.

09:01.313 --> 09:02.755
That was the point.

09:03.857 --> 09:09.424
I mean, Stalin sent a lot of his intellectuals off to the gulags, and they were just plain killed.

09:09.545 --> 09:09.845
Right.

09:10.185 --> 09:17.376
But some people were used because they had specialized... Now, for example... They were useful in some fashion.

09:17.396 --> 09:26.308
Useful in some fashion, and if you're in a library, if you're cataloging something, if you're working on Incunabula that is contributing to the Soviet

09:26.963 --> 09:37.896
contribution to the Gesamtkatalog, the Wiede Lücke in Germany, but then when the Nazis came to power, people who knew German were also suspected.

09:37.916 --> 09:41.320
They said, well, what are you, are you writing to people in Berlin?

09:41.581 --> 09:43.363
What are you writing to them?

09:43.383 --> 09:49.070
And he's sending them bibliographical information, and they say, well, maybe you're a Nazi.

09:49.090 --> 09:51.132
Maybe you're an enemy of the state.

09:51.553 --> 09:52.414
Is it in your essay?

09:52.954 --> 09:55.958
I'm sure it's there, which I will give you,

09:56.225 --> 10:11.523
But my point is that here again a second time in the century, you have people, and people that you can admire, that I can admire, whose lives have been profoundly, profoundly shaken up.

10:11.543 --> 10:16.628
I mean, think of our friend Zaitsev.

10:16.649 --> 10:19.211
How humiliating it must have been.

10:20.553 --> 10:23.336
I mean, he wouldn't say this, but just think about it.

10:23.396 --> 10:24.898
Here is a man who was

10:27.443 --> 10:44.139
responsible for... I think he was head of the cultural section of the Communist Party apparatus in St.

10:44.159 --> 10:44.379
Petersburg.

10:44.399 --> 10:52.887
Then he became a library director of one of the major libraries in the world.

10:52.907 --> 10:54.869
During the Soviet period.

10:56.010 --> 10:56.691
And now,

10:57.025 --> 11:07.696
He's coming to New York, and sitting at a table, he doesn't have any Western language, right?

11:07.716 --> 11:08.537
No, right?

11:08.557 --> 11:25.615
So he has to, you know, rely on an interpreter, but he has to rely on an interpreter in even a deeper level of trying to understand who are these people,

11:26.152 --> 11:27.354
Why are they here?

11:28.115 --> 11:29.516
Who is Baz Baines?

11:29.536 --> 11:30.798
Why is he here?

11:30.818 --> 11:32.720
Well, he doesn't even have a cool as to what I think.

11:32.740 --> 11:33.521
Right.

11:34.202 --> 11:42.233
And how does he figure into, and who is this lady who has given, you know, X number of millions of dollars?

11:43.254 --> 11:48.300
And how is it that all of this comes together, and how does this work?

11:48.420 --> 11:51.224
And how can I, and what can I do to get it worked for me?

11:51.745 --> 11:52.946
That's the question.

11:52.986 --> 11:54.909
This is really what he's trying to figure out.

11:54.929 --> 11:55.129
What is?

11:55.345 --> 11:58.008
Because the rules have changed dramatically.

11:58.208 --> 12:02.673
And not only, how does it, but I must get this to work for me.

12:02.694 --> 12:06.338
But being a survivor, he's probably sure that he's going to do it.

12:06.358 --> 12:08.220
He's got a good chance of doing it as anyone.

12:08.380 --> 12:11.304
As anyone.

12:11.324 --> 12:17.711
Is he an intellectual, fundamentally, or is he basically a party guy that is, you know?

12:17.731 --> 12:19.513
I think he has some background in the...

12:20.303 --> 12:23.747
But this is basically where he's wound up in the shake-up, I guess.

12:23.767 --> 12:24.628
In the shake-up.

12:24.809 --> 12:31.297
Actually, he was there before the profound shake-up and was able to hold on.

12:31.417 --> 12:35.562
But he could just as easily have been working in banking or commerce or something like that.

12:35.582 --> 12:37.565
Yeah, yeah, sure.

12:37.585 --> 12:40.568
And he's not like yourself, a book professional.

12:40.649 --> 12:41.349
Yeah.

12:41.369 --> 12:43.092
You know what I'm saying?

12:43.132 --> 12:45.675
His background is not in the world of letters.

12:45.695 --> 12:45.875
Right.

12:45.935 --> 12:48.218
He could have gone into some other

12:49.109 --> 12:53.153
into some other discipline, but... He's not a librarian.

12:53.294 --> 12:55.656
He's not a... Far from it.

12:55.736 --> 12:57.018
And he's not even like Paul.

12:57.038 --> 13:01.222
I mean, he's not a librarian, but he's... He was not even an academic physician.

13:01.242 --> 13:07.630
He was a cultural administrator within the party structure of the city.

13:07.650 --> 13:17.040
And here again, if you... Let me just get something from my throat before it devolves further.

13:17.560 --> 13:19.523
So you have a little call, too, I feel better.

13:19.743 --> 13:20.083
Yeah.

13:20.103 --> 13:22.767
Because I was afraid to come down today and it was my own call.

13:23.268 --> 13:25.951
In fact, I have one little throat thing left, but I'm going to take the bite.

13:25.991 --> 13:26.692
Yeah, please.

13:29.356 --> 13:32.560
This happened, actually, it came on, I think, yesterday or so.

13:32.580 --> 13:33.942
It comes in a little fast.

13:33.962 --> 13:35.344
Excuse me, one second.

13:35.564 --> 13:37.387
Would you like more coffee?

13:37.607 --> 13:38.488
I'm also fine.

13:39.169 --> 13:42.694
In fact, in another 15 minutes, I'm going to take a break.

13:42.714 --> 13:43.054
Clear up.

13:45.157 --> 13:46.639
I thought we might want to...

13:47.463 --> 13:53.530
or how you might want to proceed.

13:56.553 --> 14:15.495
I think that probably the story, if you will, that you want to tell is about this

14:18.310 --> 14:46.073
the vast academic structure, library structure, bibliophilic, book culture, that was created and pumped up in the 20th century

14:48.989 --> 14:54.795
actually throughout communist or socialist dominated lands.

15:00.681 --> 15:05.326
Including what you alluded to, namely Sarajevo.

15:05.406 --> 15:06.647
That's perfect to see.

15:07.007 --> 15:08.769
Part of that.

15:08.789 --> 15:18.439
This vast structure that with minor variance existed in socialist countries

15:19.752 --> 15:26.139
from Khabarovsk on the Pacific to the borders of Germany.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.101
What was the name of that place?

15:28.121 --> 15:34.008
Khabarovsk, the great port on the Pacific, Soviet port on the Pacific.

15:34.028 --> 15:36.531
K-H-A-B-A-R-O-V-O-S-K.

15:37.412 --> 15:38.072
Khabarovsk.

15:40.795 --> 15:45.000
This vast enterprise, cultural enterprise, which included

15:47.005 --> 16:15.291
libraries, and museums, and curators, and archives, and manuscripts, and bibliophiles, and publishers, and book designers, and, you know, that whole group of people who work with some part of book culture, and how buttressing this book culture

16:16.030 --> 16:30.183
Worst states, Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Latvia, Lithuania, for example, just looking at this, another example.

16:30.203 --> 16:39.110
Here's a catalog of Estonian book design.

16:39.131 --> 16:44.215
Also part of that, showing what the kinds of things that they

16:45.106 --> 16:50.151
covers and book designs.

16:50.171 --> 17:12.092
And part also of the story is how this book culture continued to get infusions during the period after World War II with the trophy collections, things that were

17:13.658 --> 17:28.733
captured archival manuscript documents, books from countries that the Nazis had occupied, and from the Nazis themselves, and taken to Russia.

17:28.753 --> 17:41.286
And how supporting this also was a vast publishing industry, a kind of industry

17:41.603 --> 18:09.670
In all of these areas, I mean, look at the, just even in a small private collection like this, how many books you have dealing with all aspects of book culture, listings of books, histories of bibliophiles, history of readers, history of libraries, this literature buttressing that book culture, and then how, beginning in the late 80s,

18:11.675 --> 18:40.450
As the values of these societies, or as these societies became open societies, transparent societies, because of the kind of telecommunication revolution, where people began to see themselves no longer in a kind of obfuscated way,

18:40.970 --> 19:10.774
in an obfuscated mirror, but could see themselves a little more in context, where people, library directors would come, and museum directors, who thought that they were just presiding over the greatest thing ever, and they would come and look at automation, or look at curatorial techniques in the West, or would look at the Metropolitan,

19:11.210 --> 19:20.302
after being director of the Hermitage, he said, hey, what I've been doing is wrong, is incorrect, is inherently archaic.

19:21.984 --> 19:40.187
And all of a sudden, the realization that the societies which they had been a part of, or that were a part of, were societies without an infrastructure, that many things that are taken for granted here

19:41.315 --> 19:52.105
in the West, in Scandinavia, that these things could not be taken for granted, that there was something fundamentally wrong.

19:52.125 --> 20:09.702
Then comes political revolution and economic revolution in these countries, where this whole segment of society, the curators, the writers, the bibliographers, are not

20:10.897 --> 20:20.971
off the pedestals on which they had stood, and find themselves either leaving the country, the greatest bookman.

20:21.952 --> 20:26.298
For example, the head of the rare book division in Zaitsev's library, Dr. Funken.

20:26.318 --> 20:29.362
He now lives in Brooklyn, Massachusetts.

20:29.382 --> 20:30.284
Exactly.

20:30.304 --> 20:35.311
He's one of the greatest special, fantastic languages, specialist on the bookstore.

20:35.331 --> 20:35.992
So what's he doing here?

20:36.833 --> 20:39.476
He's living with a child, I think.

20:39.516 --> 20:39.937
He left.

20:40.358 --> 20:40.718
He left.

20:40.900 --> 20:41.521
What's his name?

20:41.921 --> 20:45.326
Garfunkel, G-O-R-F-U-N-K-E-L.

20:45.506 --> 20:48.590
That's why there's about 20 miles from around there.

20:48.930 --> 20:50.673
Yeah, you would have to meet him.

20:50.693 --> 20:51.434
He's here.

20:51.454 --> 20:52.215
Alexander.

20:53.096 --> 20:54.898
And he was in charge of rare books?

20:54.918 --> 20:57.402
Rare books in Zeitz's library.

20:57.422 --> 20:57.782
In St.

20:57.802 --> 20:58.743
Peter's library.

20:59.484 --> 21:01.207
And is he working in books here?

21:01.367 --> 21:06.513
I wrote a supporting letter for him to get a fellowship at the Russian Research Center at Harvard.

21:06.533 --> 21:07.755
Is that where he is now?

21:07.855 --> 21:09.237
Yeah, he's a fellow at Harvard.

21:09.892 --> 21:12.394
Actually, yes, he must be on the phone over there.

21:12.494 --> 21:13.996
I can get to it.

21:14.016 --> 21:14.376
Gore Funko.

21:14.616 --> 21:16.058
Gore Funko.

21:16.178 --> 21:18.079
G-O-R-F-U-N-K-E-L.

21:18.139 --> 21:19.821
You'll find him just charming.

21:19.861 --> 21:21.462
He's like a little imp.

21:21.482 --> 21:26.026
And he would be able to talk about these similar things?

21:26.627 --> 21:26.767
Yeah.

21:27.067 --> 21:30.530
One further prism for you, another personality.

21:30.550 --> 21:31.091
I love it.

21:31.111 --> 21:32.552
Also, this thing, I'm quite awake.

21:32.772 --> 21:32.953
See?

21:36.256 --> 21:39.038
So, just finishing this, and then...

21:41.600 --> 21:51.113
I want to embellish on a couple, but you have people who leave the country, Yevtushenko living a block from yours truly.

21:51.133 --> 21:51.634
Do you know him?

21:52.935 --> 21:54.978
I see him in the stores.

21:55.058 --> 21:57.441
Is he accessible?

21:57.902 --> 22:01.006
I don't think he's ever been an easy man.

22:02.068 --> 22:05.372
He's evidently a brilliant teacher.

22:05.673 --> 22:11.100
And teachers, he has a university meaning that you're paying some exorbitant.

22:11.367 --> 22:13.269
Not exorbitant, large-style.

22:13.309 --> 22:14.871
Wonderful.

22:15.491 --> 22:18.174
Like John Silber hiring Nobel Laureates at BNU.

22:18.214 --> 22:20.257
We know what they pay him.

22:21.057 --> 22:21.558
Right.

22:21.638 --> 22:26.583
So Yevtushchenko's in the department there at Queens College, and lives right here.

22:27.645 --> 22:31.709
And I see him on the street at his shop or something.

22:31.729 --> 22:34.932
He has an office there at the university.

22:35.133 --> 22:36.374
Yeah, I'll get you his home.

22:36.414 --> 22:38.336
That's not a problem.

22:38.356 --> 22:40.058
But he's very typical.

22:40.375 --> 22:48.468
Imagine, he was a member of that very top belief, and he's now living in Forestville, and even in the déclasse part of Forestville.

22:50.271 --> 22:54.839
So... Did he bring his books with them there one day?

22:54.859 --> 22:56.001
I don't know.

22:56.181 --> 22:58.365
I mean, did he leave Russia?

22:59.727 --> 23:01.470
Or is this kind of a temporary gig for him?

23:01.490 --> 23:07.159
He probably has an apartment still somewhere, or a dacha, or a home in Russia.

23:07.291 --> 23:15.522
Many people, now, when you ask a person where they live from Eastern Europe, I mean, it's a very difficult question to ask.

23:15.542 --> 23:18.807
We live here, part of the year there.

23:18.827 --> 23:21.370
It's like trying to find a homeland for Yiddish, in a way.

23:21.691 --> 23:22.191
Where is it?

23:22.312 --> 23:25.175
Nobody knows.

23:25.196 --> 23:27.238
So, excuse me one second.

23:27.799 --> 23:34.328
And then I want to take a very brief walk, because at 1.45, I want to go...

23:35.168 --> 23:37.171
My doctor is right over here.

23:37.191 --> 23:46.787
No, I think that's probably enough for a session, too, because I'm driving back, too, so... Okay, but... We're back on it.

23:46.907 --> 24:01.952
What I could envision is a series of, and it depends on your power of writing, a series of...

24:04.649 --> 24:25.154
cameos in a series of word pictures on some of these people who, from different sectors, it could be a major publisher.

24:25.174 --> 24:29.099
It could be a very major library director.

24:29.119 --> 24:32.884
It could be a very major bibliographer, scholar, curator.

24:34.147 --> 24:47.145
It could be a major museum director, because in my perception, books, manuscripts, and stuff, and museums, it's that whole world that I'm talking about.

24:47.165 --> 24:49.108
And I treat them very similarly in this book.

24:49.849 --> 24:55.497
It's about books, but I write about manuscripts, and I'm interested in the whole art thing.

24:55.662 --> 24:57.484
It's cultural treasure is what we're talking about.

24:57.504 --> 24:57.965
Exactly.

24:58.045 --> 25:04.793
And then can we just go into the other one because I just want to show you so that you see a slightly different... Did you finish your summary, by the way?

25:06.395 --> 25:25.618
To have a series of word pictures or cameos as to how in this vast area the lives of people and of whole parts of the society the book curatorial

25:26.223 --> 25:28.565
cultural part of the society.

25:28.625 --> 25:32.269
I'm not talking so much now about dance or theater or that kind of thing.

25:32.289 --> 25:33.850
It's a little outside of my cat.

25:34.251 --> 25:49.125
But the whole kind of cultural curatorial world has been the rules of the game for them have been changed in mid-course.

25:49.145 --> 25:55.791
And their lives are becoming increasingly precarious.

25:56.682 --> 25:59.586
increasingly unstable.

25:59.926 --> 26:01.188
This is of the professionals.

26:01.228 --> 26:05.433
The professionals, but also the bibliophiles, the collectors.

26:05.473 --> 26:07.235
But how about the fate of the book itself?

26:08.737 --> 26:10.279
Is it uncertain?

26:10.359 --> 26:11.881
Is it threatened?

26:11.981 --> 26:17.768
Is Sarajevo a metaphor for anything in your view?

26:18.129 --> 26:25.778
I think that it is a metaphor, maybe,

26:26.028 --> 26:43.469
may be a little too grandiose, but what has happened is that rules now are not governed by, or the book world is not governed by subsidy.

26:43.489 --> 26:54.583
It is governed by very straightforward economic rules, whereas that was not the case.

26:55.036 --> 27:18.581
before 89, you could publish a book, Czech Illuminated Manuscript 13, and the book cost 220 Czech crowns.

27:18.601 --> 27:21.484
Now there are 30 crowns to the dollar.

27:22.005 --> 27:24.908
So this book costs $6.

27:26.052 --> 27:27.073
Six dollars.

27:27.333 --> 27:29.555
For what looks like a $75 book.

27:29.575 --> 27:30.776
Or $100 book.

27:32.198 --> 27:37.563
This book was published... 1990.

27:38.564 --> 27:40.506
Just on the cost.

27:40.526 --> 27:41.687
Try and do it today.

27:43.068 --> 27:49.294
Because the guy, if he's still alive, is no longer getting his salary in a regular way.

27:49.394 --> 27:50.735
He's impoverished.

27:50.755 --> 27:53.798
And the institution is also impoverished.

27:54.132 --> 27:56.034
and the publishing house that did it is also.

27:57.255 --> 28:00.818
So how, you know, when you say, is the book going to survive?

28:00.838 --> 28:02.299
Yes, certain kinds of books are.

28:04.261 --> 28:06.263
But they're going to be business directories.

28:06.603 --> 28:08.305
They're going to be banking directories.

28:08.425 --> 28:13.009
When we talk about books and libraries of the future, there are two totally different contexts for that.

28:13.370 --> 28:20.316
We're talking in the Western sense, and I guess you're talking about just having them come up to something approaching where we are now.

28:20.536 --> 28:21.557
Yeah, exactly.

28:21.790 --> 28:24.032
That is another thing.

28:24.052 --> 28:27.776
What you're doing, I think, is the following.

28:28.637 --> 28:35.585
This book covers one part of universal reality, but only one part.

28:35.745 --> 28:40.770
I call what I'm doing now a companion and not a sequel to this.

28:41.331 --> 28:44.895
I really think that this is elementary school.

28:45.435 --> 28:46.497
This is just collecting.

28:46.717 --> 28:46.937
Right.

28:47.660 --> 28:54.386
But now I'm trying to erase the whole concept of book culture, people, you know, where it goes.

28:55.587 --> 29:16.367
But you're also taking here a different part of the world where, in our society, technological innovation, some economic change, changes and mores of the society,

29:16.955 --> 29:21.323
have influenced the shape of book culture to come.

29:21.663 --> 29:32.742
There, what you had is someone coming and kind of erasing what existed before.

29:33.664 --> 29:41.157
And really, now when you go,

29:44.107 --> 30:07.528
into a bookstore, let's say, in Eastern Europe, you either see complete impoverishment, in other words, there's nothing there, or you go and you see Western books, Jackie Steele, or translations of occult literature, or sex manuals, or business directories.

30:08.189 --> 30:11.852
In other words, this kind of thing,

30:13.115 --> 30:19.442
has receded and become very, very, very marginal.

30:19.903 --> 30:26.650
I'm talking about these kinds of books.

30:27.291 --> 30:39.865
Books about books, book culture, art books, things that are elements of already a society

30:40.587 --> 30:45.412
that is supported in some way, that has an infrastructure.

30:46.333 --> 30:58.144
Over here in the West, in the United States in particular, we talk about dumbing down our culture, and what you're suggesting is that there's a certain degree of dumbing down going on over there as well.

30:58.164 --> 31:09.295
A dumbing down, but also almost a lobotomy, again, as after the revolution, taking place where a certain thing is just pulled out, extricated,

31:09.781 --> 31:14.786
And other values are coming to the fore.

31:15.807 --> 31:18.170
People now... Right.

31:18.190 --> 31:32.405
The number of books thefts in Russia, historical library, the Moscow State University library, the Zaito's own library, major thefts.

31:32.425 --> 31:32.726
By whom?

31:33.346 --> 31:35.068
By insiders in some cases.

31:35.088 --> 31:36.590
Selling over here, do you think?

31:36.610 --> 31:38.792
Selling in various parts of the world.

31:39.532 --> 31:44.037
Hebrew manuscripts are the most precious kind, etc., etc.

31:44.477 --> 31:50.965
What I'm saying is that the book now is no longer to be read, interpreted, it's to be stolen.

31:51.806 --> 31:55.770
It's to be an object of economic interest.

31:55.790 --> 32:00.475
Something to be sold on the book, on the black market.

32:00.495 --> 32:00.835
Exactly.

32:01.877 --> 32:03.198
It's a commodity.

32:05.521 --> 32:05.781
Right.

32:05.801 --> 32:07.162
Okay.

32:07.182 --> 32:08.644
Now, can we look at the other room?

32:08.894 --> 32:10.656
And then what I, what time is it now?

32:10.956 --> 32:12.277
It's 1, I think we're 12.20.

32:12.338 --> 32:13.018
Right.

32:14.079 --> 32:17.943
Then what I'd like to do is to take about a half... Start it again.

32:19.285 --> 32:34.260
The destruction in other parts of Eastern Europe has not been physical in the way it's been in parts of the Caucasus or in Serbia, but morally and psychologically.

32:34.898 --> 33:01.298
the destruction has been just as devastating on the lives of people who have spent the better part of their lives working in the area of book culture, and now, for a variety of reasons, no longer being able to pursue this course here.

33:01.939 --> 33:02.239
Okay, go ahead.

33:02.692 --> 33:15.067
You come down this street, and... Another element of this... Could you just give me an idea of what you mean by the destruction, though not physical?

33:15.528 --> 33:16.128
In what sense?

33:16.569 --> 33:17.050
Moral.

33:17.210 --> 33:18.992
How, how, how, how is it?

33:19.032 --> 33:31.247
For example, where a person who was a valued and honored member of society, reasonably well paid,

33:32.054 --> 33:56.658
let's say a curator, now gets no money for months on end, because the military is more of a priority than the people who work in museums, in libraries, and territories, they're not going to go to the barricades in the last part.

33:56.738 --> 34:01.302
But the military are armed, and if they're not paid, you have a major,

34:04.133 --> 34:09.760
major emblem.

34:09.780 --> 34:29.184
And so these people are eking out an existence while presiding over materials that are of international significance, like the curators of the Hermitage.

34:31.066 --> 34:31.727
You're sitting next

34:32.602 --> 35:01.663
to the greatest collections of impressionist art and you yourself are not paid it's like being a servant at a banquet where you're left performing a function but not being part any longer of that and not even being allowed to eat in the kitchen for that matter exactly because there's nothing

35:02.352 --> 35:08.798
to eat except for the people who economically control the society.

35:13.442 --> 35:16.385
Now, you can see very vividly here.

35:19.848 --> 35:30.418
The next question, I suppose, is trying to get what we needed.

35:30.635 --> 35:32.377
Let's develop a short list of people.

35:33.218 --> 35:38.323
And also a subsidy for your work.

35:38.343 --> 35:48.854
Are you interested in getting additional... These cultures have been living in a bifurcated environment.

35:48.974 --> 35:50.596
Most of the 20th century.

35:51.056 --> 35:51.537
Right.

35:51.557 --> 35:55.401
You had a culture that was developing over there.

35:56.222 --> 35:58.184
You had a culture in emigration.

35:59.165 --> 36:00.186
And the two...

36:00.470 --> 36:11.200
had not really come together until the decline of the socialist regimes.

36:12.681 --> 36:24.111
So whatever was going on in the book world, in immigration, was very little known to people over there.

36:25.312 --> 36:30.477
So you had collections developing, like the one in Putnam,

36:31.655 --> 36:37.261
which were a counterweight to what these people... In Putnam, Connecticut?

36:37.381 --> 36:38.442
Yeah.

36:38.502 --> 36:41.105
It's a Lithuanian, that's where I went.

36:41.145 --> 36:42.927
It's a Lithuanian immigrant library.

36:42.947 --> 36:46.851
And it's in Putnam, Connecticut.

36:46.871 --> 36:47.812
Is that something I should see?

36:49.134 --> 36:55.661
It's all interesting as a kind of, we're getting wet again.

36:55.801 --> 36:57.763
All right.

37:04.021 --> 37:19.184
And you have these emigres trying to gather books and materials that are going to give the lie to the governments over there.

37:19.204 --> 37:19.845
Well, I like that.

37:19.865 --> 37:22.329
I like that.

37:22.489 --> 37:25.514
This is also unusual.

37:25.574 --> 37:31.142
I don't know of another example

37:32.067 --> 37:56.860
where there were so many, like space, black, being developed, because all of these people who are afraid of themselves, they all had them, because they were desperately afraid that their countries were being distorted over there.

37:57.835 --> 38:01.239
And in fact, they were.

38:01.259 --> 38:25.125
And that they, here in the West, the emigrant libraries and archives and museums were bastions of truth.

38:26.928 --> 38:34.841
It's not the same with the Greek emigration, is it?

38:34.861 --> 38:35.041
No.

38:35.081 --> 38:39.989
Because there was also always a movement back and forth.

38:40.310 --> 38:52.750
So,

38:54.637 --> 39:05.174
This adds a particular kind of buoyancy to these people's fate in the 20s.

39:05.434 --> 39:18.535
Not only were they hermetically sealed within those societies, but there was no way of even their co-nationals communicating

39:20.236 --> 39:21.417
communicating with them.

39:21.437 --> 39:33.769
It was not only from the world at Orange that they were isolated, but most especially from their co-nationalists who were living out their lives and existence here in counterweight to what was going on there.

39:34.970 --> 39:46.581
For example, here in New York, there are probably two very major Ukrainian libraries that were formed just as a kind of counterweight to what they saw

39:47.033 --> 39:48.976
Formed here?

39:48.996 --> 39:50.178
Since when?

39:50.278 --> 39:52.382
Since the post-war period.

39:52.642 --> 39:53.183
Where are they?

39:53.704 --> 40:01.096
There's one on 100th Street, former Carnegie Library, there's another one on Lower... Under whose auspices?

40:01.116 --> 40:07.006
Shochenko Scientific Society, Ukrainian Free Academy of Sciences, and so on.

40:07.106 --> 40:08.328
So they're institutions?

40:08.348 --> 40:09.891
They're institutional libraries?

40:09.911 --> 40:11.674
Sure, they publish and so on.

40:12.953 --> 40:15.176
And almost all of the ethnic groups have.

40:15.196 --> 40:20.682
The Russians, the Estonians, the Lithuanians, the Blackians.

40:20.782 --> 40:21.743
Emigre libraries.

40:22.003 --> 40:23.245
How did they get the stuff over here?

40:23.265 --> 40:24.386
Did they have to sneak it out?

40:24.446 --> 40:25.788
Some was collected here.

40:25.828 --> 40:29.252
There were bibliophiles in immigration.

40:29.893 --> 40:37.161
They gathered materials in Germany and South America, and so on and so forth.

40:37.241 --> 40:38.883
It's a whole museum in San Francisco.

40:38.903 --> 40:41.526
It's a great organization.

40:41.793 --> 40:48.980
And now the people from over there are coming here trying to convince them to give this material back to them.

40:49.000 --> 40:49.941
I love that stuff.

40:49.961 --> 40:51.883
That's another interesting nuance.

40:53.465 --> 40:55.727
That's kind of what you were saying the other day in your library.

40:55.747 --> 41:00.892
There were people there from Russia studying their own history because the materials are here and not there.

41:01.152 --> 41:02.173
They're there every day.

41:03.074 --> 41:07.058
I just had an artist.

41:07.443 --> 41:14.571
who's doing the designs, the exceses, the frescoes, the great Cathedral of Christ the Savior in Moscow.

41:15.051 --> 41:26.023
We came here to look at our photographs of the cathedral that were done in the 19th century because they're very vivid depictions of what it looked like before it was destroyed in the 20s.
