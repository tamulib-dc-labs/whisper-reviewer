WEBVTT

00:04.081 --> 00:08.626
I put hundreds of hours of taping this.

00:09.527 --> 00:23.862
Ricky J. You became a collector, really, as one device, one way of helping you craft, I guess.

00:23.882 --> 00:25.644
That's what I said yesterday, yeah.

00:25.664 --> 00:31.270
It's absolutely true that my inspiration was going to

00:32.887 --> 00:35.109
going to old books, initially looking for material.

00:35.410 --> 00:42.657
I mean, I've always had this thing about wanting to do performance that was different from what other people were doing in my field.

00:43.678 --> 00:51.466
And other than inventing material, which I do, and which is great fun, the other way to deal with that is to be doing things that are so old people have forgotten.

00:52.747 --> 00:56.211
So I started looking at books for that reason.

00:56.311 --> 00:57.612
And about when would you say

00:58.435 --> 00:59.096
I'm very bad.

00:59.116 --> 01:08.507
I mean, one thing I can tell you is that I can remember almost all the events of my life, but I cannot give you any idea of how they appeared chronologically.

01:08.527 --> 01:09.669
I'm just very bad at that.

01:09.689 --> 01:15.476
Well, how about what phase of your... were you still learning the craft, the young man?

01:15.897 --> 01:17.358
I'm still learning the craft now.

01:18.400 --> 01:23.045
It's, you know, it's limitless, the pursuit of sleight of hand, so I'll be learning it always.

01:23.246 --> 01:28.392
But, yeah, I suppose I first started reading histories when I was...

01:29.367 --> 01:33.373
a teenager or in college, but I wasn't actively collecting at that point.

01:33.433 --> 01:35.576
I mean, I guess I've been seriously collecting.

01:35.676 --> 01:38.881
I mean, see, I'm reluctant to say things like this, because I honestly don't know.

01:39.302 --> 01:42.486
I mean, my guess would be 15 years, but maybe it's 20 years.

01:42.867 --> 01:44.629
So you were like 30, maybe.

01:45.090 --> 01:45.651
Maybe younger.

01:45.711 --> 01:46.372
But that's okay.

01:46.412 --> 01:48.055
I'm younger, yeah.

01:48.075 --> 01:57.248
Well, just so we could have a framework, but would you say you got the, was there a point at which

01:57.886 --> 02:04.439
You weren't just acquiring material, but you became obsessed with the... Well, I mean, it's very interesting.

02:04.459 --> 02:12.435
There's a man who was at the talk yesterday, and whose house I'm staying at right now, who was really responsible for me becoming, I think, a serious collector.

02:12.905 --> 02:15.829
He's a fascinating man as well.

02:16.971 --> 02:17.932
Will you tell me who he is?

02:18.112 --> 02:23.821
Yeah, his name is Percy Diaconis, and he's a professor at Harvard, and was a magician for years, and a serious book collector.

02:23.841 --> 02:25.162
And we were kids together in New York.

02:25.183 --> 02:25.884
He's two years old.

02:25.904 --> 02:27.506
Is he somebody I had to touch with you?

02:27.526 --> 02:28.147
That's possible.

02:28.327 --> 02:30.490
I mean, he's a wonderful, wonderful fellow.

02:30.590 --> 02:32.473
I mean, brilliant, interesting.

02:33.094 --> 02:34.296
How did he spell his last name?

02:35.437 --> 02:36.839
It's a Greek.

02:38.081 --> 02:39.223
D-I-A-C-O-N-I-S.

02:39.263 --> 02:41.646
I don't know if he'll talk, but I mean, you're more than welcome in.

02:42.217 --> 02:44.219
I haven't shut down yet on this, I have to say.

02:44.540 --> 02:52.129
Well, except he's kind of reluctant to talk about... I mean, he's a very serious academic, he's a MacArthur fellow.

02:52.189 --> 02:58.617
I mean, he's an amazing guy, and he just sort of shies away from publicity.

02:58.637 --> 03:04.424
Well, anyway, but he... Anyway, he and I, you know... I would name him, by the way, without... Childhood friends.

03:04.444 --> 03:07.748
Yeah, well, it's his permission, not mine, that matters in terms of this.

03:08.228 --> 03:10.671
Seriously, I mean, I respect his worship in that sense.

03:11.208 --> 03:13.210
I mean, we're great friends, obviously.

03:15.432 --> 03:18.355
But, you know, we knew of each other as child magicians in New York.

03:18.515 --> 03:22.439
But he became a serious collector long before I did, when he was a kid.

03:22.479 --> 03:23.800
Collecting in this area?

03:23.861 --> 03:26.223
Yeah, in this subject.

03:28.265 --> 03:36.473
And when we met again, I guess he was in graduate school here at Harvard, and I guess I was at Cornell.

03:36.790 --> 03:37.571
I came here.

03:37.591 --> 03:38.793
I moved here one year.

03:38.833 --> 03:39.814
I mean, and this is the problem.

03:39.874 --> 03:41.476
I'm never going to be able to tell you what year it was.

03:42.037 --> 03:51.190
It was one year when I rented a place in Cambridge or Somerville, somewhere right in this area, for a year, and I only spent five weeks in this apartment that I rented.

03:51.310 --> 03:54.494
I was on the road for 11 months of this year performing.

03:55.416 --> 04:01.544
But in the weeks that I was here, we reacquainted and became friends, again, having had seen each other since kids.

04:01.904 --> 04:05.970
And I had access to his library, and I was intrigued by it.

04:06.946 --> 04:30.000
um in the years that followed i mean he you know he and i spent a lot of time together talking about talking about these books and you know our collections aren't identical uh by any stretch i mean you know i then i branched off quickly into this field of unusual entertainments rather than just mainstream magical um which he doesn't collect but uh he's

04:30.757 --> 04:31.378
He's wonderful.

04:31.398 --> 04:34.001
I mean, he's a great person to talk about.

04:34.021 --> 04:44.974
I mean, the thing that I suppose we have that's different than people I know in this field is that we approach the history of magic and the literature of magic from the sense of the magician and what he did.

04:45.595 --> 04:48.078
It's not just an exercise in what was his book about.

04:48.118 --> 04:51.582
It's trying to understand the performance that's being described as well.

04:52.643 --> 04:59.211
And I think, to some extent, you have to be a solidly good performer to be able to intuit it on that level.

04:59.427 --> 05:02.931
And there are people who write fascinating historical work who don't go into that.

05:03.252 --> 05:08.398
But sometimes there's a sense of loss about that, that maybe they're missing the point.

05:08.418 --> 05:11.482
And this is not to knock everybody who's written histories of magic.

05:11.542 --> 05:24.979
It's just to say that I think it's a wonderful advantage to approach it from the state of being able to perform it.

05:25.887 --> 05:49.310
Actually, one of the theses I'm pursuing in this book is that the collector doesn't just acquire and accumulate and put things on the shelves, but in many cases, the collector is responsible for the colors and nice stories, for preserving things, for saving things which otherwise would be lost and would disappear.

05:49.890 --> 05:52.873
And I wonder if you, in your own way, are not only

05:54.558 --> 06:01.464
putting together an archive of pretty rare and fascinating material, but also by your practice perpetuating it.

06:01.524 --> 06:03.906
I mean... Well, to me, that's the way a library lives.

06:03.967 --> 06:13.035
I mean, my goal as the curator of a collection, beyond my personal interest, is to show that this art form is absolutely alive now.

06:13.055 --> 06:14.756
I mean, that's really essential.

06:14.836 --> 06:17.739
Is it alive through the books?

06:18.159 --> 06:20.381
To be honest, it's alive through performance.

06:20.401 --> 06:24.345
I mean, the books are a tool, and they're important as a road, you know,

06:24.494 --> 06:29.940
to take to get you for performance, but it's not just the books that keep it alive.

06:29.960 --> 06:37.888
I mean, I think that when it's most effective is when you see, you know, the results of that.

06:37.968 --> 06:43.735
Okay, but I understand this, but you're a young man, 43 years old.

06:43.775 --> 06:49.641
You did some fascinating things yesterday, and if I understood what you were saying, these were things that you learned

06:49.891 --> 07:00.829
a number of these things, 16th century, 17th century, 18th century stunts, if that's the correct word, that you picked up out of these sources.

07:02.191 --> 07:04.275
So, in a way, the book did preserve them for you.

07:04.495 --> 07:06.358
I mean, they passed this knowledge on to you.

07:06.438 --> 07:06.919
Is that true?

07:07.780 --> 07:07.881
Yeah.

07:07.901 --> 07:13.570
I mean, it is true, but I also had people to help me interpret them and to see...

07:13.988 --> 07:19.255
You know, I mean, there are cases where I just found an old book, realized there was a wonderful principle, and then began to perform it.

07:19.295 --> 07:19.836
That's true.

07:19.856 --> 07:24.062
And so if that is true, I guess that answers your question.

07:24.082 --> 07:32.854
Now, of course, one of the great strengths of magic is that we don't know what the hell it is you're doing.

07:32.894 --> 07:33.956
We don't know how you're doing it.

07:34.216 --> 07:36.459
You know, it's a sense of wonder, it's a sense of awe.

07:36.599 --> 07:42.207
In these books, however, are these tricks...

07:42.676 --> 07:43.357
passed on?

07:43.377 --> 07:45.140
I mean, do the great job?

07:45.180 --> 07:51.930
Yeah, they're rarely written well enough for you to just be able to understand, and that's why I guess I used the word intuit before.

07:51.950 --> 07:54.414
I think you have to come to it with some knowledge.

07:54.434 --> 08:03.849
If you pick up a magic book, it's pretty much to me like reading an engineering text or a math text, but it's very, very hard to just pick that up and to understand what it is.

08:04.891 --> 08:09.578
And I'd say that there are very few people who I've ever met in my life who are accomplished

08:09.963 --> 08:37.337
and you'll find that my standards are generally higher than most people's i mean i i it takes a lot to impress me in the performance of magic i've seen wonderful things in my life and i i don't often say to people that's good when i don't think it's good i mean so to really be accomplished in this field i'm suggesting is a very difficult thing to do and there's almost no one who has been able to do that without some sort of personal tutelage just from books it's

08:37.587 --> 09:06.649
not totally impossible but almost impossible it's almost the same with calligraphy as well which is another field i have some serious interest in well do you need a mentor then you need a i guess that's what i'm saying you do you know the literature is incredibly helpful but you need a mentor sure and do you think that that in the continuum through the centuries that it has it's something that primarily is passed on yeah in spite of the fact that there is this absolutely enormous amount of literature in the field i do believe that that that the real secrets have been passed

09:06.967 --> 09:31.540
you know hand to hand person to person there's more accessible now in this field than there has ever been i mean and the thing is that i think every succeeding generation laments the amount of material which is available in this field really yeah sure i mean you read old literature and you see people complaining about this used to be a great secret and now people know about it well to me things that were known 20 years ago to a half a dozen people

09:31.857 --> 09:36.682
are in some cases purchasable in a general bookstore for under $10.

09:36.842 --> 09:38.004
I mean, some of the great secrets.

09:38.024 --> 09:38.805
Does that upset you?

09:39.065 --> 09:40.026
Yes, it does upset me.

09:40.086 --> 09:50.638
But on the other hand, being able to do that material well and to, you know, gain the understanding and the knowledge necessary to do that well doesn't come from buying that book.

09:50.678 --> 09:58.406
You have to really sit down and be able to... Professional or amateur isn't the key either, which is interesting.

09:58.426 --> 10:01.830
Some of the greatest magic done in the world is done by amateur, flat out.

10:02.452 --> 10:10.102
You know, amateurs have a great advantage on some level, I mean, in the old sense of the word, the Greek sense.

10:10.202 --> 10:11.503
What would the advantage be?

10:11.523 --> 10:17.851
That they're not in any way motivated by money, and so it's a much purer approach.

10:17.912 --> 10:20.114
They don't have to work for an audience of people.

10:20.174 --> 10:21.917
I mean, they can just pursue it as an art model.

10:21.937 --> 10:27.784
I think of a friend of mine named Steve Freeman, who was a financial analyst down in Ventura, who was, you know, just a...

10:28.017 --> 10:37.067
a masterful exponent of sleight of hand who doesn't perform for money, who does it for the love of the art, who's just amazingly accomplished.

10:37.467 --> 10:38.228
And that's wonderful.

10:38.248 --> 10:42.793
There may be some levels on which he envies my ability to be able to go out and do it for a paying audience.

10:42.853 --> 10:45.256
I mean, you always find something attractive on the other side.

10:45.917 --> 10:55.127
So I have a great dislike of people who don't take the art seriously and who butcher the art, but the division isn't simply amateur or professional.

10:55.207 --> 10:57.349
There are professionals who butcher the art constantly.

10:57.599 --> 11:02.147
And there are amateurs who are so good they could easily be professionals, but choose not to be.

11:02.167 --> 11:10.481
Is it possible to see an amateur, I mean a professional, a bad professional, screw up a trick and because he's doing it so poorly, figure out the technique?

11:10.722 --> 11:12.845
Absolutely, and that infuriates me.

11:12.865 --> 11:15.430
I mean, the idea... And that blows it for all the... I think it does.

11:15.590 --> 11:23.083
It blows it to a certain extent that if that secret is made available, no matter how well the next person performs it,

11:23.553 --> 11:47.890
there's going to be a sense of loss and that's the difference between magic and singing if you hear somebody go out and butcher a wonderful song and then you hear another person sing it beautifully it doesn't ruin it for you you know you can you can appreciate that and the same with the playing of an instrument or the same of you know how many times have you gone out and seen shakespeare butchered and then you see a great performance and it's a great performance that is one of the problems with magic that if

11:48.562 --> 11:57.074
If this principle really is exposed by ineptitude, no matter how wonderfully it's performed the next time, it's not quite the same.

11:57.094 --> 11:59.998
Are there things that you see that you don't understand how they're being done?

12:00.018 --> 12:02.161
Occasionally, it's a wonderful feeling.

12:02.581 --> 12:03.943
Can you give me an example?

12:03.983 --> 12:04.564
More often?

12:05.025 --> 12:07.268
Well, I mean, I'm still fooled by people.

12:07.408 --> 12:08.950
It's just, it's great.

12:10.583 --> 12:20.859
Vernon, who is, you know, my mentor, and Percy's as well, I mean, you know, Guy Vernon is a great sleight of hand artist, who's 95 now, I mean... Where does that man live?

12:20.919 --> 12:23.222
He lives in Los Angeles, you know, I mean, he still pulls me.

12:23.242 --> 12:27.809
It's great, and then, you know, just recently I was... Maybe I could call him and get a quote from him about you.

12:28.070 --> 12:28.590
Would you mind?

12:28.771 --> 12:34.279
I wouldn't mind it, again, if he chooses to... You know, at 95, he's a pretty irascible fellow.

12:34.299 --> 12:38.325
I've got a 95-year-old guy interviewed, I'll tell you something about him later, Dave Kirshner, I've never heard of him.

12:38.345 --> 12:39.527
I'll tell you about him later.

12:39.997 --> 12:43.201
But yeah, sure, you can call him and see what he says.

12:43.601 --> 12:47.747
You know, depending on his mood, he might be very anxious to talk about it.

12:47.827 --> 12:49.569
I mean, he just came to my conference.

12:49.589 --> 12:55.997
You know, I just put on this conference on the history of magic in Los Angeles, and he was in the front row every day for three days listening to every lecture.

12:56.518 --> 12:57.379
You know, he's wonderful.

12:57.419 --> 12:58.981
I mean, he's so wonderful.

12:59.001 --> 12:59.421
His name?

13:00.282 --> 13:03.887
Dai, D-A-I, Burnett, D-E-R-N-O-N.

13:03.907 --> 13:04.047
Uh-huh.

13:04.870 --> 13:11.905
And then recently I've seen some wonderful stuff from a young magician named Michael Weber that really puzzled me very badly.

13:11.985 --> 13:13.629
You say very badly.

13:13.829 --> 13:15.192
Yeah, I mean fooled me.

13:15.894 --> 13:16.896
No, not at all, no.

13:17.156 --> 13:17.758
Excited you?

13:17.978 --> 13:19.521
Yeah, absolutely.

13:19.541 --> 13:23.149
It's exciting to be fooled, and it's a great feeling.

13:23.737 --> 13:24.818
Now, is it principle?

13:24.838 --> 13:27.481
See, I'm not in the field, obviously.

13:27.561 --> 13:29.543
I'm a neophyte when it comes to this.

13:29.563 --> 13:29.783
It could.

13:29.803 --> 13:31.625
I mean, there are lots of things that can do one.

13:31.665 --> 13:35.309
It can be a principle that you know that's disguised beautifully.

13:35.329 --> 13:36.550
It can be a new principle.

13:37.471 --> 13:39.173
It can be a combination of principles.

13:39.233 --> 13:40.754
It can be any of those things that do.

13:40.794 --> 13:51.645
But people who really come up who are incredibly creative, like Percy, or Michael Webb, or David Ross, I mean, it's exciting to see things.

13:51.826 --> 13:52.286
Oh, yeah.

13:52.306 --> 13:53.187
It's a wonderful feeling.

13:53.437 --> 14:02.006
You know, they've said in writing, there's nothing new to write about, it's just a variation of the same classic theme.

14:02.026 --> 14:04.328
Can this be said in magic as well?

14:04.348 --> 14:08.072
Yes, I mean, you know, right, there are only so many principles.

14:08.092 --> 14:16.000
But on the other hand, I mean, the reason I love cards so much, I mean, Hobsons are called cards, the poetry of magic, and the possibilities are almost limitless.

14:16.040 --> 14:19.343
I mean, here's Vernon, who's been the major figure in his art for a hundred years.

14:19.897 --> 14:21.099
And he's still learning.

14:21.519 --> 14:24.423
There are 52 objects.

14:24.543 --> 14:27.287
I mean, the possibilities are simply limitless.

14:27.347 --> 14:28.829
And so there are always new principles.

14:28.889 --> 14:31.613
And yes, most of them are based on old principles.

14:31.653 --> 14:40.384
That was, again, part of the thing we were talking about in the lecture yesterday with the impenetrable secret, tracing it back, tracing it forward, coming up with new variations, dealing with it, analyzing it.

14:40.945 --> 14:44.770
That's part of the process that I find so exciting in my field.

14:44.790 --> 14:47.474
Do you have a definition that you work by for magic?

14:47.494 --> 14:47.794
No.

14:48.854 --> 14:50.756
I answered that quickly, huh?

14:50.776 --> 14:51.156
No, I don't.

14:51.196 --> 14:54.359
I mean, I've never said and tried to define it.

14:56.562 --> 14:59.044
I think it would limit it to do that.

14:59.064 --> 15:03.849
But now that you are one in a series, I think, and you don't really have a beginning for it.

15:03.869 --> 15:06.211
I mean, it goes back as far as people... Right.

15:06.231 --> 15:09.234
There's a beginning of the literature and that we discussed, you know.

15:10.596 --> 15:12.538
Yeah, it's hard to know when it was first done.

15:12.558 --> 15:17.863
I mean, some people would call it the oldest, the oldest profession.

15:17.883 --> 15:17.983
Yeah.

15:18.807 --> 15:21.931
What was the question I was working on there?

15:23.813 --> 15:27.037
But the literature, as you pointed out, well, yeah, all right.

15:27.057 --> 15:32.765
There was a point in the Elizabethan times, for instance, when they were compared.

15:32.865 --> 15:34.567
Playwrights, of course, were in the same.

15:34.947 --> 15:39.714
Actors were considered nothing more than vagabonds and ruffians.

15:41.916 --> 15:42.737
Tricksters, right?

15:42.797 --> 15:45.100
I mean, whatever.

15:45.461 --> 15:48.004
You mentioned that yesterday.

15:48.929 --> 15:51.772
And at some point, obviously, they became respectable?

15:51.792 --> 15:57.679
Well, I actually started to talk about saying they didn't become respectable, that they weren't respectable then and they weren't respectable now.

15:57.699 --> 16:11.174
I would say there was a brief period in the middle of the 19th century, largely because of the Salon Hobson's there in Vienna and the Théâtre Robert Houdin in Paris, where magic did become respectable.

16:11.275 --> 16:14.278
I mean, people who went to see Hobson's perform in his Salon,

16:15.068 --> 16:20.816
were the same people who would go to the highest forms of artistic entertainment in all of Vienna.

16:20.897 --> 16:23.220
It was considered on that same level.

16:23.240 --> 16:24.141
And that excites me.

16:25.043 --> 16:33.074
As much as I've always been, you know, a fan of the tawdry sideshow carnival aspect of this, you know, I work sideshow, I love it.

16:33.615 --> 16:36.199
I also think that people have to understand that there exists

16:36.517 --> 16:38.841
incredibly classic side to it as well.

16:39.001 --> 16:43.589
And, you know, it's nice to know that both exist.

16:43.669 --> 16:46.874
It's interesting that associations make that very hard now.

16:47.255 --> 16:53.004
Well, I watched the, you know, that was a pretty good gathering of people yesterday.

16:53.024 --> 16:55.027
I mean, it had them.

16:55.047 --> 16:59.375
I mean, bending over, looking over to see what they were doing.

16:59.455 --> 17:02.119
You know, two feet and saying, how is he doing this thing, you know?

17:02.487 --> 17:06.291
And, yeah, absolutely, it is awesome.

17:06.312 --> 17:09.355
I mean, it's like my little kids watching animation.

17:10.997 --> 17:11.978
What does it do?

17:12.078 --> 17:13.540
It really does inspire wonder.

17:15.402 --> 17:22.330
Maybe you're kind of like a Disney for older people, you know?

17:23.312 --> 17:25.574
The idea is to achieve wonder, I guess.

17:25.855 --> 17:28.898
Well, it's certainly, yeah, largely fun.

17:29.138 --> 17:30.520
I don't know.

17:31.073 --> 17:35.861
The thing about books, of course, is to preserve and to transmit knowledge.

17:35.921 --> 17:41.590
It's not going to be a book of definitions, but obviously what we get from books is a connection with the past.

17:42.211 --> 17:49.943
It is kind of contradictory in a way, isn't it, that you're passing on information that an individual can use to...

17:50.952 --> 17:54.796
Not to deceive people, but to trick them, I guess.

17:54.997 --> 17:55.998
Well, it is deceiving.

17:56.078 --> 17:58.520
I mean, I'm interested in deception.

17:58.541 --> 17:59.261
I mean, I collect.

17:59.321 --> 18:02.725
One of the major areas I collect in is on deception.

18:02.745 --> 18:09.413
You know, I have a large personal collection, one of the largest of material on frauds and confidence games and gambling.

18:09.493 --> 18:11.335
You mean beyond your profession, in other words?

18:11.916 --> 18:13.738
Well, you know, what's the link with my profession?

18:13.758 --> 18:16.681
I mean, again, it's hard to define where one stops and another starts.

18:16.901 --> 18:17.702
It's...

18:18.526 --> 18:27.445
You know, the basis of it is deceiving someone, is fooling someone, and it's one of the reasons it's so peculiar to accept it as an art form, but it's also fascinating.

18:27.465 --> 18:35.242
I mean, again, it's a concept which goes back to antiquity and which is, you know, always interesting to people.

18:35.523 --> 18:38.008
Thomas J. Wise is going to be a medical point.

18:38.048 --> 18:38.830
You must have stuff.

18:39.181 --> 18:41.804
Yeah, sure.

18:41.824 --> 18:43.445
Let's talk a little bit about the collection.

18:43.605 --> 18:48.110
We haven't really talked in terms of numbers and the types of things that you have.

18:48.130 --> 18:50.532
My own collection?

18:50.572 --> 18:50.672
Yeah.

18:50.773 --> 18:53.095
And let's separate the two.

18:53.115 --> 18:55.117
You did mention that the Mulholland are separate.

18:55.217 --> 18:55.998
Right.

18:56.398 --> 19:00.602
I'll be happy to talk about both.

19:00.622 --> 19:03.105
My own collection, I guess, is in three basic areas.

19:05.167 --> 19:08.310
I collect material on magic,

19:08.763 --> 19:11.167
literature of Gondra.

19:12.188 --> 19:19.178
I collect material on unusual entertainers, which is largely the basis of the things that you see in my book.

19:19.198 --> 19:28.071
For instance, I'd say 80 to 90 percent of those illustrations are from my own collection, and that came before I really was associated with the library.

19:28.171 --> 19:35.462
I researched at the library when I was at the Players Club, but when I say the library, I mean Mulholland.

19:35.797 --> 20:00.370
know that field and that's a field that as far as i know i mean they're just i never really knew anybody actively collecting in that field i know a few people who are peripheral and then the third the third large area is gambling and swindling you know material and deception so those are the three major areas i really couldn't tell you how many books i have i don't know i suppose between three and five thousand volumes and then

20:01.868 --> 20:15.491
Oh, hundreds if not thousands of posters and playbills and pieces of ephemera dealing with the same things, whatever original material I can find, manuscripts and letters.

20:15.531 --> 20:18.576
Would you say that you clearly have the bug now?

20:18.596 --> 20:22.623
I mean, it's not just to nourish the profession.

20:23.645 --> 20:28.112
No, I mean, it's gratifying on a level.

20:28.396 --> 20:30.418
you know, beyond that as well.

20:30.438 --> 20:33.021
I mean, and I'm troubled by some of those areas of collecting.

20:33.041 --> 20:35.543
I mean, the need to own something often is troublesome.

20:35.984 --> 20:36.464
Why is that?

20:37.205 --> 20:38.586
I'm not sure exactly why.

20:38.687 --> 20:44.092
I guess maybe I don't like the thought of collecting becoming competitive.

20:44.152 --> 20:48.677
I mean, I've seen too much of people wanting to have something to keep somebody else from having it.

20:49.257 --> 20:52.861
I think collecting can take you into some negative areas if you're not careful.

20:52.881 --> 20:56.665
And, you know, I find even in myself a need to

20:57.151 --> 20:58.654
to temper that kind of thing.

21:00.416 --> 21:05.305
I think every collector has the ability to rationalize why they should have an item that no one else should.

21:05.946 --> 21:07.949
And I find myself doing that all the time.

21:08.009 --> 21:13.178
And it's easy for me because I write about the field and I perform in the field.

21:13.298 --> 21:22.213
So I'm often resentful of somebody getting a book that I want for some real specific need and that they want simply because they don't have it.

21:22.480 --> 21:25.003
and they're never going to open it, and they're never going to do anything with it.

21:25.204 --> 21:27.707
And I think, like I say, that all collectors do that.

21:27.727 --> 21:31.452
You're one of the few people, I would say, who could actually write off every purchase that you buy.

21:31.472 --> 21:32.654
I don't know if you do or you don't.

21:32.674 --> 21:33.655
That's your business.

21:33.855 --> 21:37.800
I mean, it certainly is work-related, yeah.

21:37.820 --> 21:40.304
Although, again, that's not what motivated me to do it.

21:41.185 --> 21:44.269
I mean, to some extent, the writing of Lerner Tiggs rationalized

21:44.570 --> 21:49.095
What was for me at some times, you know, a pretty compulsive endeavor.

21:49.175 --> 21:54.861
I mean, I guess there was no requirement saying that I was dead up to my years buying books for many, many years.

21:56.083 --> 22:05.073
All the years that I was putting this collection together when I wasn't doing particularly well and felt some genuine need to do it, and I wasn't even sure what that was.

22:05.093 --> 22:13.202
I mean, I knew that I was just so incredibly engrossed in this field that I continued to do it, and then suddenly when Learning Picks came out, it all seemed to make sense.

22:13.222 --> 22:13.362
Yeah.

22:13.865 --> 22:32.443
You just glided over something that's fascinating to me, the fact that you were acquiring to the point of depriving food, you know, from... Well, actually, a few booksellers told me that they flat out believed I paid more of a percentage of the money I earned on books than anyone they knew.

22:32.543 --> 22:33.325
I certainly...

22:33.625 --> 22:38.394
I think by nature, someone who has little money is paying more of a percentage than people who are enormously wealthy.

22:38.434 --> 22:50.416
I mean, when you think about it, you know, we have friends who, among those you're interviewing in the books, who just make some very big purchases lately that I think are, you know, even though they sound, you know, their one purchase may be more than my collection is worth.

22:50.957 --> 22:56.427
You know, it's still far less proportionately, is my guess, you know.

22:56.761 --> 22:57.862
than what I was spending.

22:57.882 --> 23:02.026
I mean, I was basically spending everything I made on it and a lot that I didn't make on it.

23:02.086 --> 23:03.487
I mean, I was just living on it.

23:03.547 --> 23:04.768
You clearly crossed the line.

23:04.828 --> 23:08.512
You weren't just getting material then to learn.

23:09.773 --> 23:10.754
No, by that time, no.

23:10.814 --> 23:13.877
I was already... Sure, I mean, there's no question.

23:14.377 --> 23:15.978
I'm a serious, serious collector.

23:15.998 --> 23:17.320
That's great.

23:17.340 --> 23:18.501
There's no question about it.

23:19.101 --> 23:25.367
And there's no... Now, looking back on it, even though, you know, I'm finally doing far, far better,

23:26.039 --> 23:29.964
There are some things that now would have gone up so many times that I got up I could have bought them then.

23:30.124 --> 23:32.588
You know, I traded and never sold.

23:32.668 --> 23:34.310
It's very interesting in all those years.

23:34.370 --> 23:36.793
But, I mean, I was often trading things and making.

23:37.254 --> 23:41.400
I was considered, I think, in my field a bad trader because I traded from passion.

23:41.420 --> 23:46.967
I didn't care if I was giving away something that was more valuable as long as it was something that I wanted.

23:47.470 --> 23:57.027
And even though there was no clear goal in mind, I just became absolutely intrigued, you know, clearly passionate about these areas.

23:57.568 --> 24:06.344
One thing that the people I'm writing about have in common, for the most part, is that they know their collections.

24:06.364 --> 24:08.247
And then you get people who buy, I mean,

24:08.800 --> 24:17.249
Not to mention names, but like Carter Burden in New York, he was acquired 80,000 books for seven or eight years, five or 6,000 authors.

24:17.530 --> 24:22.335
I can't imagine that this man knows all his authors, never mind all of his books.

24:22.355 --> 24:24.477
What's the purpose of that kind of a collection?

24:24.858 --> 24:27.881
I mean, yours really is a very clear collection.

24:28.001 --> 24:31.365
It really does nourish your profession.

24:31.683 --> 24:34.547
You know everything that you... I assume that you read everything that you buy.

24:34.567 --> 24:38.392
Well, there was a time when I honestly said I'd read every book that I owned.

24:38.412 --> 24:39.654
I can no one would say that.

24:39.774 --> 24:41.136
But you know every book that you wrote.

24:41.156 --> 24:41.717
Well, I try.

24:41.757 --> 24:59.762
And even when I buy for the library, I mean, there's a process where every book that I buy, whether it's cataloged by me or somebody else or one of the free people who work for me, it's still... It goes on a shelf for me to look at and feel and handle before it's shelved, you know, in the body of the collection.

25:00.223 --> 25:00.323
Okay.

25:00.472 --> 25:01.353
And that's essential.

25:01.774 --> 25:04.218
But even there, it gets out of hand.

25:04.238 --> 25:11.128
I mean, if you buy a collection of 500 books or 1,000 books, it's awfully hard to do that.

25:11.809 --> 25:13.712
Of course, at this point, I know most of those books.

25:13.952 --> 25:17.318
If we buy a collection of 500 books, they're probably not going to be more than a handful.

25:17.358 --> 25:17.838
I don't know.

25:18.680 --> 25:20.482
But I do find that necessary.

25:20.502 --> 25:24.268
The other thing that's interesting about these books is that you often buy a book for a particular reason.

25:24.974 --> 25:34.589
and then five years down the line you're writing about something else, and it never occurs to you that a book you already own has material in this other area, because that's not why you got it.

25:34.609 --> 25:40.017
I mean, and that's another rationale for having the book rather than taking it out of a library and returning it.

25:40.037 --> 25:42.040
I absolutely subscribe to that.

25:42.060 --> 25:42.481
It happens.

25:42.962 --> 25:51.234
I have books I've had for 10, 15 years, and all of a sudden, and it may not even be a book that you've ever read, but you know where that book is, and you know what's in it.

25:51.254 --> 25:53.698
Winston Churchill said it's not important for a gentleman

25:54.151 --> 25:55.713
who has read every book in his library.

25:55.733 --> 25:59.217
It's important for him to know what's in his library and how it can help him.

25:59.237 --> 26:00.739
And that's a pretty good working definition.

26:00.759 --> 26:03.483
I would say I have no objection to that protocol.

26:03.503 --> 26:07.448
I mean, I think we both know that the majority of people who collect books don't read them.

26:07.468 --> 26:09.891
I mean, I think that that really is flat-out true.

26:10.312 --> 26:22.727
And I think one of the reasons that booksellers were so good to me in the years when I had no money, and I formed these relationships with a lot of terrific booksellers, Steve Wiseman is a good example, was at the lecture yesterday.

26:22.747 --> 26:23.989
You know him from Zoom next.

26:24.442 --> 26:29.068
I don't know how many years, you could ask him about this, it was before I was able to buy a book from him.

26:29.088 --> 26:31.832
I used to come to his shop and sit there and read books.

26:32.212 --> 26:35.917
I mean, I would salivate over these books, and I just couldn't afford to buy them.

26:35.937 --> 26:40.023
And he, I mean, he just used to let me go into the shop and sit there and read them, you know.

26:40.263 --> 26:41.225
He didn't have the bug.

26:41.245 --> 26:43.007
I mean, you're giving...

26:43.291 --> 26:44.853
pieces of yourself here.

26:45.033 --> 26:45.353
Sure.

26:46.495 --> 26:51.380
You know, and there's some books that got away even from him in those years because he thought I really couldn't afford them.

26:51.440 --> 26:53.903
I mean, you know, he would turn up some wonderful things.

26:53.923 --> 27:02.673
Can you give me an example or two of things that you really, I mean, that are elusive, that you really, but maybe you don't want to tell me that.

27:02.693 --> 27:08.980
Well, there's always the thing if they go in print, it makes it really hard, but one of the books I referred to yesterday is a good example of that.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.863
I mean, it's my worst story as a book collector, even though it has a

27:12.097 --> 27:23.449
as happy an ending as I could have, and that was that I was really intrigued with this French book, Jean Prévost, Le Premier Parti de Subtle and Pleasant Invention.

27:24.930 --> 27:38.104
And I was able to locate a copy, and it had never been written about, really, more than a paragraph at the most in any magical literature that I knew of, even in France, and yet I knew that it was incredibly important, and I was able to get the book,

27:38.945 --> 27:41.127
and I had to make payments to get it.

27:41.207 --> 27:46.112
It was, you know, thousands of dollars, and at a time when I had... So somebody knows that.

27:46.452 --> 27:49.555
Yeah, although, you know, yeah, sure.

27:49.595 --> 27:51.216
I mean, well, it's a 16th century book.

27:51.336 --> 27:53.498
That's the first book in its field.

27:54.059 --> 27:56.421
So, you know, this is not going to be a hundred-dollar book.

27:56.501 --> 28:00.025
On the other hand, we're not talking about hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars either.

28:01.226 --> 28:07.011
But I actually, through a few disasters that seem just so incredibly peculiar, I mean...

28:07.295 --> 28:12.062
a tour of Australia that fell apart because of an airplane strike, Johnny Carson's divorce.

28:12.103 --> 28:19.434
I mean, things that seemed that they would have nothing to do with my life made it impossible for me to pay for this book during a requisite amount of time.

28:19.634 --> 28:22.759
And so I was able to steer the book into the hands of a very good friend.

28:23.601 --> 28:30.872
But it still was a real loss, even though there's no place on earth I would be happier to have this book than where it wound up.

28:31.055 --> 28:33.021
I would still be happier to own it myself.

28:33.121 --> 28:33.763
You don't.

28:33.824 --> 28:34.827
No, I no longer do.

28:34.867 --> 28:36.692
I owned it for six months, and I no longer do.

28:36.712 --> 28:43.714
Did you ever try and... Well, the nature of the transaction with my friend was that

28:44.167 --> 29:14.038
um we wouldn't do that you know and now that i could pay for the book you know i mean that option doesn't exist anymore and i wouldn't so you know um i shouldn't say i wouldn't if the opportunity was there but that that was part of the transaction and i mean his dealing was totally fair on it and the other thing is it's interestingly enough another friend would have loaned me the money to do it at that time but i was so in debt that i was very worried about it i mean i was already many thousands in debt to uh to booksellers and

29:14.913 --> 29:15.534
I don't know.

29:15.554 --> 29:20.523
I suppose there's some part of that that's sobering and also important.

29:21.585 --> 29:24.991
Like I said before, we were talking about the negative side of collecting.

29:25.011 --> 29:29.118
The idea of coveting things so much is not helping.

29:29.138 --> 29:30.240
It's clearly not helping.

29:30.260 --> 29:31.021
Well, it's a mania.

29:31.041 --> 29:32.744
I mean, so they call it a mania.

29:32.764 --> 29:34.547
Yeah, you're right.

29:34.567 --> 29:35.289
It is.

29:35.309 --> 29:37.372
Did I tell you the title of my book?

29:37.412 --> 29:38.254
I'm not sure.

29:38.274 --> 29:40.077
The title of my book is A Gentle Madness.

29:40.327 --> 29:41.068
Oh, no, you haven't.

29:41.088 --> 29:42.030
That's very nice.

29:42.110 --> 29:52.486
I derive it from Isaiah Thomas, whose grandson wrote a little obituary for him, and he said, my grandfather was afflicted with the gentlest of infirmities, bibliomania.

29:53.348 --> 29:53.908
That's very nice.

29:54.069 --> 29:56.052
And I said, that's nice.

29:56.072 --> 30:02.983
So I say, a gentle madness, colon, excursions, excursions among book collectors, past and present.

30:04.104 --> 30:05.727
But the beauty of it is, is how...

30:06.888 --> 30:16.538
Your example is really wonderful because you as a professional person had a kinship with people two and three or four centuries in the past.

30:16.618 --> 30:16.919
Oh, absolutely.

30:16.939 --> 30:18.660
And book collectors also.

30:18.680 --> 30:24.787
I mean, I will actually trace behavioral patterns and we're not going to make this a sociological study.

30:24.807 --> 30:26.589
Well, but to some extent it has to be.

30:26.609 --> 30:29.231
But motivation is one of the key things we're trying to establish.

30:29.352 --> 30:33.596
Well, here's the thing that will probably strike you as really strange and contradictory.

30:33.636 --> 30:35.898
And yet, to me, it's perfectly rationalized.

30:35.938 --> 30:36.439
And that is...

30:36.740 --> 30:40.744
that I've invented quite a few effects of my own in magic.

30:40.764 --> 30:42.405
I invent material.

30:42.425 --> 30:43.146
Tell me a couple.

30:44.207 --> 30:47.630
Unimportant, really.

30:47.670 --> 30:49.792
You'll see why I don't.

30:49.812 --> 30:57.279
The thing is, there is a great repository of material of currently invented magic.

30:57.299 --> 31:04.165
There are magic magazines that go out, and there are thousands of aficionados who buy these magazines and books that are published all the time.

31:04.516 --> 31:07.099
of original creations by magicians.

31:07.119 --> 31:10.684
And to an overwhelming extent, these creations are not original at all.

31:10.704 --> 31:24.341
They're either people who haven't read the past literature and don't know, or they're people who are creating variations of published effects, and in doing so, not realizing that they're publishing the discarded methods of more brilliant inventors.

31:24.361 --> 31:25.803
I mean, this happens to Vernon all the time.

31:25.823 --> 31:27.065
He's the best example of that.

31:28.266 --> 31:34.354
He published a trick, you know, I mean, he's published hundreds of thousands of really wonderful things with new concepts.

31:34.739 --> 31:55.365
And for most of his life, he's then seen people publish the variations that he discarded to get to this brilliant method, you know, being put out by people who think they're brilliant and original and innovative and who don't have the understanding that what they're publishing is not nearly as good as what's already been published and don't have the wisdom to assume that someone else might have thought of it first.

31:55.385 --> 31:57.848
Anyway, I've chosen in my life not to be involved in that.

31:57.888 --> 32:04.476
I have never published an idea of mine in a magical journal, a trip of mine, an effect of mine.

32:05.738 --> 32:09.743
And this would seem contradictory because I derive so much pleasure from written effects.

32:09.763 --> 32:12.867
I give effects that I've done to magicians whose work I like.

32:13.527 --> 32:16.551
They, in turn, may give me effects of theirs, published or unpublished.

32:16.571 --> 32:18.013
That's not the point.

32:18.033 --> 32:22.658
Because I'd like to see what I've come up with handled beautifully.

32:22.838 --> 32:26.583
I'd like to see someone who will take the time and energy to do it well.

32:27.104 --> 32:33.551
If I put it in a magazine, I'm basically giving my permission for it to be done and butchered by anybody.

32:33.571 --> 32:35.053
And I just won't become part of that.

32:35.438 --> 32:40.063
And I also won't become part of the petty game of who invented what and what came first.

32:40.163 --> 32:45.989
And there is a genuinely vitriolic magic scene for people who hate each other.

32:46.009 --> 32:53.957
I mean, literally despise each other, you know, claiming credit for things that for the most part go back far earlier than these people who were even alive and they don't even understand that.

32:54.598 --> 32:56.921
And I just won't take part in this.

32:57.001 --> 32:59.483
And people say to me, well, you know, how do you do that?

32:59.503 --> 33:01.125
How can you have a position like that?

33:01.409 --> 33:04.714
You know, wouldn't you be deprived if you didn't know this secret?

33:04.794 --> 33:09.861
You know, you were fortunate as a kid, and you knew great magicians, and they told you things, or you had access to books.

33:10.542 --> 33:11.504
You know, what if you didn't?

33:11.624 --> 33:21.959
And I say, I would rather that these things remain secret, and even I didn't know about them, than that they became so public that they lost all respect.

33:21.979 --> 33:26.486
And that seems like a genuine contradiction, but I think I can rationalize it.

33:26.506 --> 33:28.869
The most interesting case in the history of magic about that.

33:28.889 --> 33:30.792
Well, just before you pick that up on that, but...

33:30.991 --> 33:34.960
you still feel it is important that this wonderful effect

33:35.345 --> 33:36.286
should be passed on.

33:36.426 --> 33:39.330
I mean, Richard Jay's only a temporary resident.

33:39.350 --> 33:40.131
Yeah, no, no, I do.

33:40.551 --> 33:42.274
You know, I'd like to think of that.

33:42.494 --> 33:44.937
You know, and I mean, like I say, I don't... So how is that done?

33:44.957 --> 33:45.998
Through the mentor process?

33:46.018 --> 33:52.046
Well, I think so, that that is the answer, right, that it's done, you know, person-to-person rather than a general dissemination of knowledge.

33:52.146 --> 33:53.027
Okay, now pick up where you were.

33:53.047 --> 33:57.132
Well, where I was going to pick up was a man who I mentioned again in the talk yesterday, who is really significant.

33:57.152 --> 34:00.717
There's a man named Johann Nephemok Hoppsons, or this Viennese official.

34:00.737 --> 34:02.739
I couldn't write, I tried to write that one down.

34:02.899 --> 34:04.221
Yeah, it's a wonderful, wonderful man.

34:04.640 --> 34:08.546
You know, if you want, I'll let you look at the... I have a written text of the thought.

34:08.566 --> 34:17.719
I mean, I went off and spoke much more about American imprints because we were at AAS, but if that's helpful for you to take a look at that, yeah, sure.

34:19.141 --> 34:34.242
Anyway, Hopsinger is a great example because this is a man I admire as much as anyone in the world of magic, and he was, you know, remarkably innovative, and you might remember there was a question from the floor about that, about how long his theater was up in Vienna, and

34:34.559 --> 34:37.784
What I didn't go into detail about is that he lived a very hard life.

34:37.804 --> 34:39.807
He died impoverished.

34:39.867 --> 34:45.715
His magic, which was accepted by the Viennese aristocracy, was never effective when he went on the road with it.

34:46.136 --> 34:48.219
You know, he was a small and elegant performer.

34:49.380 --> 34:55.369
There's no one in the history of magic I would have rather seen perform, because I don't have such a precise idea of how he actually worked.

34:55.923 --> 35:04.816
I feel probably even more of a kinship with a man named Max Malini, who I have a long chapter about in my book, but I have a real sense of what Malini was like when he performed with Hobson.

35:05.336 --> 35:08.721
You know, if I could go back in history, I'm much less sure of what it would have been.

35:08.761 --> 35:10.864
I know his inventions were absolutely brilliant.

35:11.986 --> 35:23.382
But this is a case where almost everything we know about Hobson came from this one man, this German named Otto Carfischer, because Hobson at the end was bitter and anguished and impoverished.

35:23.699 --> 35:29.485
and he asked his wife to destroy all his notes and letters and all his material.

35:29.505 --> 35:38.073
And through the efforts of this one man who tracked down firsthand the pupils of Hostinger, the few pupils he had over his years, he resurrected all this material.

35:38.093 --> 35:38.753
Now, it is.

35:38.773 --> 35:41.196
It's truly a great and romantic story.

35:43.998 --> 35:47.161
So, I mean, to me, this is genuinely wonderful.

35:47.522 --> 35:50.905
And yet today, I mean, I read accounts written by...

35:51.340 --> 36:00.548
by supposed magic authorities who say that Hobson's work is boring and obsolete, and, you know, you want to strangle them, you know, because they're again failing to see the beauty of this idea.

36:00.629 --> 36:03.431
Who was the person, do you know the name of the person who rescued Hobson's work?

36:03.451 --> 36:05.413
Yeah, sure, and his name was Otto Carr Fisher.

36:06.134 --> 36:08.236
O-T-T-A-K-A-R.

36:09.156 --> 36:10.758
O-T-T-O-K-A-R.

36:11.539 --> 36:13.040
F-I-S-C-H-E-R.

36:13.841 --> 36:18.445
Well, he's much of a hero in the... Oh, yeah, I mean, he died years ago, and he is...

36:18.678 --> 36:19.639
But is he a hero or not?

36:19.659 --> 36:21.322
I mean, this has happened all through literature.

36:21.342 --> 36:26.168
I mean, how many times have we heard about novelists asking for their crafts to be destroyed?

36:26.549 --> 36:46.475
This is, to me, a great romantic story in magic, that this man, you know... And then when you read Hobson's letters, too, I mean, all the concerns and passions that I find myself expressing to friends who are my really great magical friends, like Percy or Steve Freeman, the people we're talking about, I see in Hobson's letters people who don't understand his creations.

36:46.495 --> 36:47.757
He's writing to his friends...

36:47.922 --> 36:51.789
who are complaining that these things that he's sending them are too expensive.

36:52.510 --> 36:54.394
And they're absolutely brilliant ideas.

36:54.434 --> 36:59.683
And if I think they're brilliant in 1990, what must have they been like in 1850?

37:00.264 --> 37:05.273
I mean, it's staggering to think of the effect that these must have had on people.

37:06.248 --> 37:09.072
And yet there's the same unfeeling, unseeing.

37:09.133 --> 37:10.455
Yes, there are contemporary accounts.

37:10.475 --> 37:16.624
There's some contemporary reviews of him, and there was a biography that was written of him in a journal that very few people know about.

37:16.765 --> 37:19.970
And yeah, so it wasn't, you know, there was a record of him.

37:20.190 --> 37:22.894
There's a street named after him in Vienna.

37:22.914 --> 37:25.759
I mean, you know, people knew, you know.

37:25.779 --> 37:27.882
So you've done your bit to perpetuate him.

37:29.224 --> 37:31.708
Well, maybe, maybe.

37:31.728 --> 37:33.591
I mean, how do you perpetuate him again?

37:33.631 --> 37:34.112
I think

37:34.345 --> 37:35.026
There are two ways.

37:35.146 --> 37:36.829
One is to write about it.

37:36.889 --> 37:37.570
You write about it.

37:37.590 --> 37:41.716
The other thing is obviously to perform his effects, which I do, I think.

37:41.736 --> 37:43.078
That's wonderful.

37:43.298 --> 37:44.239
That's very difficult, too.

37:44.259 --> 37:55.656
You see, in magic... See, we're winding up talking more about magic than books, but I suppose the only way to understand my sort of strange take on things is that it's very hard to give credit for magic.

37:55.676 --> 38:03.087
You know, a songwriter can effortlessly credit the person who wrote his song, and that does nothing to take away from it.

38:03.353 --> 38:05.516
a singer who can credit the songwriter, exactly.

38:06.137 --> 38:11.485
But a magician who stops a performance to say, this was invented by someone else.

38:11.565 --> 38:14.049
I mean, I can do that in an historical lecture.

38:14.069 --> 38:15.551
It's one of the reasons I love that form.

38:16.813 --> 38:26.748
If I'm sitting here and my job is to create some miracle, nothing will take away more from the miracle than to tell you it was invented by someone else.

38:26.768 --> 38:29.512
Again, one of the reasons magic is different than any other performing art.

38:29.532 --> 38:31.555
I mean, you want to come away sensing

38:31.838 --> 38:42.352
that the person you saw was magical, you know, not that they bought a prop, practiced a thing, read a book, you know, so it's very, very hard to credit.

38:42.372 --> 38:53.847
And yet I do want to perpetuate Hobson's Earp and other people who I think were geniuses, and that may be one of the reasons that at the moment I don't perform in nightclubs, and I do do lectures on the history of magic.

38:53.867 --> 38:58.453
But I don't, I wasn't trying to suggest that you would credit the originator,

38:58.636 --> 39:05.764
in the course of a performance, but you certainly do it when you write books and when you give your lectures, you're paying homage at that point.

39:05.784 --> 39:07.085
Yeah, and I think it's good to do.

39:07.105 --> 39:11.410
I mean, that whole performance yesterday was, I mean, that was a whole exercise in giving credit.

39:11.430 --> 39:22.442
Yeah, I agree that it was, yeah, and like I said, I like it and I'm comfortable doing it, but I would also say that it's contradictory to creating the greatest impression as a performer of magic.

39:22.462 --> 39:23.183
I mean, that's what you do.

39:23.243 --> 39:27.748
As a performer of magic, you want people to believe that you do miracles and that

39:28.657 --> 39:32.482
See, one of the things that's so difficult about the field is the attribution of power.

39:32.902 --> 39:34.524
I mean, that's a very complex issue.

39:34.905 --> 39:37.668
What do people think when they see someone doing magic?

39:38.149 --> 39:55.690
See, if I'm showing you as a gambling expert, I'm showing you that I'm competent to shuffle the deck and deal out any hand that I want, that I can stack the cards, that I can deal from the bottom, that I can deal from the middle, then you must pay me the compliment of having skill.

39:55.951 --> 39:57.853
That's what I've shown you, that I have skill.

39:58.627 --> 40:12.623
If I'm doing something that involves, you know, a ball coming under a cup, you're not sure whether this involves, you know, my hand or a prop or, I mean, what is the attribution there?

40:12.643 --> 40:13.864
I mean, it's very different.

40:13.884 --> 40:14.585
It's very difficult.

40:15.146 --> 40:24.076
And almost all the really sage writers on magic talk about the fact that to do magic at its best, there should be no manifest display of skill.

40:24.096 --> 40:25.798
That it should just look like something happened.

40:26.977 --> 40:30.941
Well, I have theories about it.

40:32.123 --> 40:38.890
I think personally I thought that there are only one of two ways you can really impress an audience.

40:38.910 --> 40:47.019
And one is to show them something so dazzling that they will then have to say this man can do anything that can be done with a deck of cards.

40:47.779 --> 40:50.422
Or to do nothing and then let these miracles take place.

40:50.562 --> 40:53.085
But when these miracles take place and you've done nothing,

40:53.673 --> 40:58.498
It's just as easy to attribute it to something like, you know, you often hear people say, that's a trick.

40:59.019 --> 41:03.283
And that becomes some sort of satisfying answer for them, even though it means nothing.

41:03.303 --> 41:04.825
Or that's something you buy in a store.

41:06.126 --> 41:08.849
They're put off balance by this sort of thing, and they don't know.

41:09.150 --> 41:10.831
It's very difficult.

41:10.851 --> 41:12.253
So it's tricky.

41:12.473 --> 41:18.840
And then the third area that I suppose is really interesting is the idea of mind reading or extrasensory perception.

41:19.641 --> 41:22.684
Anything where you seem to be able to read someone's thoughts,

41:23.170 --> 41:24.852
Well, then it goes back to power again.

41:24.913 --> 41:25.994
Do you have that power?

41:26.134 --> 41:27.276
Or is it attractive?

41:27.296 --> 41:27.596
Do you?

41:29.940 --> 41:31.282
I saw that little thing yesterday.

41:31.302 --> 41:33.225
It was pretty good.

41:33.926 --> 41:34.446
It's interesting.

41:34.526 --> 41:38.632
I mean, it's very complex, and it's very difficult.

41:39.954 --> 41:50.910
Interestingly enough, this Nikolai Tolstoy, who's writing a three-volume biography of Merlin, the magician, and I asked him.

41:50.930 --> 41:52.873
I couldn't read the thing because of the truth.

41:53.478 --> 41:57.722
historical novels of Celtic history, you know.

41:57.742 --> 42:00.145
But the premise is interesting.

42:00.165 --> 42:01.486
I said, why are you doing this?

42:01.506 --> 42:07.272
He said, to justify the purchase of 10,000 books of Celtic history and the next 10,000.

42:07.832 --> 42:08.813
I mean, this is another guy.

42:08.893 --> 42:12.677
I mean, he's been so obsessed with this subject.

42:13.278 --> 42:15.340
He knows as much about Merlin.

42:15.560 --> 42:22.827
You know, the documentation of Merlin is a hell of a lot stronger than it was for King Arthur because the magician was, I guess,

42:23.498 --> 42:29.747
elevated to a level that even a monarch occasionally wouldn't achieve.

42:30.248 --> 42:38.279
I mean, do you find sometimes that you're placed in the category of a brain surgeon or, you know, an airline pilot, people to whom we entrust our fates?

42:39.380 --> 42:51.818
I think I've one or two times expressed, and I'm not sure in what medium, and I'm not necessarily in any interview, that the only thing that ever scares me about magic is not what I do, but occasionally what people are willing to attribute to me, that people...

42:52.540 --> 43:17.670
are it seems to me all too easily willing to attribute power to me and a mystical thing beyond anything that i do and that that's sometimes very troubling it's very scary i mean i've had people run out of out of clubs screaming and clutching rosary beads and i mean the reactions are sometimes and i've had other reactions so i've had people taking punches at me and throwing shot glasses at me people are often angry when they're fooled

43:17.870 --> 43:43.253
um even though as you can tell from what i did yesterday i mean i try to be very respectful with the people that i use even though i think there's a lot of humor particularly in all my nightclub years um you know i don't want the humor to come out of attacking the people who are nice enough to help me but even so um when people are fooled their reactions just run the gamut of emotions and and all of those things well i think if people are fooled

43:44.009 --> 43:47.072
They don't want to be humiliated, and I think that's the fine line.

43:47.272 --> 43:59.163
Well, but the point is, I mean, I know there are times when there's absolutely nothing I've done to humiliate them, and yet they feel in some way humiliated, inferior, ignorant, whatever.

43:59.283 --> 44:07.251
I imagine you have to judge the people carefully, very carefully, before you invite them on the stage.

44:07.291 --> 44:09.913
I mean, you have to do a pretty quick character study, I would guess.

44:10.213 --> 44:12.936
Yeah, and you're not always right.

44:14.013 --> 44:15.294
Now you mentioned gambling.

44:15.815 --> 44:17.536
Do they allow you to gamble in casinos?

44:18.577 --> 44:23.202
I have been asked not to gamble in some casinos, but in general I'm allowed to play.

44:23.222 --> 44:24.003
I don't any longer.

44:24.043 --> 44:27.446
At one point in my life I was interested in playing cards.

44:27.466 --> 44:28.447
I mean, it's hard to do both.

44:29.648 --> 44:30.869
I should crap myself.

44:30.929 --> 44:37.115
There's no way you can, so far as I know, I mean, I wish you could do anything to craps, is there?

44:37.856 --> 44:37.996
Ha!

44:38.577 --> 44:39.998
Is there?

44:40.018 --> 44:41.660
I mean, I'll turn the machine off for this.

44:41.680 --> 44:42.901
Of course, of course.

44:43.281 --> 44:43.902
Really?

44:44.472 --> 44:45.634
I'll shut that off.

44:45.654 --> 44:45.714
No.

44:45.734 --> 44:48.498
I mean, I'm not going to go into... You mean casino craps?

44:48.558 --> 44:51.922
You mean somebody with skill can do things just throwing them like that?

44:51.942 --> 44:53.264
Really?

44:53.284 --> 44:54.146
Yeah.

44:54.166 --> 44:54.446
Really?

45:00.354 --> 45:01.055
Yeah.

45:01.075 --> 45:03.699
Sure, but I mean, the biggest problem, I mean, you don't usually have to worry about that.

45:03.719 --> 45:09.467
The problems are usually people, you know, a dice mob coming in to take off the casino.

45:09.700 --> 45:13.024
rather than today, I mean... Oh, no, no, it's not the individual.

45:13.084 --> 45:14.866
They're trying to be the host.

45:14.886 --> 45:15.407
Right.

45:15.427 --> 45:22.695
But I'm just wondering if you could make a certain number come up as opposed to, you know, make a hard floor come up or a six or a nine.

45:23.076 --> 45:25.198
Well, sure, I mean, you can control, you know, dice.

45:25.238 --> 45:29.083
I mean, admittedly, on a casino table, that's tougher than it is.

45:29.143 --> 45:32.867
It's tough because you've got to hit them.

45:32.967 --> 45:33.548
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:33.588 --> 45:33.969
But, yeah.

45:33.989 --> 45:34.629
That's not relevant.

45:34.649 --> 45:37.413
Interesting.

45:37.433 --> 45:37.733
Um...

45:39.350 --> 45:46.640
You mentioned... I guess the great example of the one that got away is the one you told me, and it really didn't get away because it's in friendly hands.

45:46.921 --> 45:49.765
Yeah, well, I mean, there are other examples.

45:49.945 --> 45:51.066
What's one of the great finds?

45:52.288 --> 45:54.832
Have you ever come across something?

45:54.852 --> 45:55.673
I'll tell you a good start.

45:56.374 --> 46:01.341
One day I was... I had a little house in Venice, you know, by the beach in California.

46:01.681 --> 46:04.145
It's a nice backyard right on the Venice Canal.

46:05.306 --> 46:06.488
And one day...

46:08.881 --> 46:37.538
one day uh i i heard someone call my name a very strange actor ricky and i looked out and my former karate instructor was in a rowboat on the venice canal well this is a pretty strange sight you don't often see boats on the venice canal i mean it's you know the sort of body of water that hasn't been active right i mean it's not you know um

46:39.053 --> 46:57.502
Anyway, my karate instructor and one of his kids was in this rowboat, and on a canal perpendicular to my canal, a house that I could literally see from my house, was another man who used to study karate with the same man, and they invited me over to his house.

46:57.842 --> 47:01.047
Somehow they were in this rowboat and going to his house.

47:01.328 --> 47:06.816
And I went over to this fellow's house, and he said to me, are you still collecting toys?

47:07.690 --> 47:14.018
And I was never a serious toy collector, but I used a lot of wind-up and mechanical toys in my act.

47:14.038 --> 47:15.741
I had all sorts of crazy effects.

47:15.761 --> 47:19.145
I mean, I had a learned pig, which would go around and find playing cards.

47:19.185 --> 47:21.528
I'd have one selected, and the learned pig would find it.

47:21.548 --> 47:22.890
It was even before the book came out.

47:22.930 --> 47:25.914
I mean, it was just one area that I played with a lot.

47:25.934 --> 47:28.557
And in the process, I had a couple of hundred old toys.

47:28.678 --> 47:30.680
I mean, some, I suppose, were valuable.

47:32.563 --> 47:35.767
But it was never, I never, again, I didn't collect them as a collector.

47:35.807 --> 47:37.309
I collected them for something to do.

47:38.217 --> 47:48.008
And he remembered from the times we had worked out together, somehow this came up, and he used to work for an antique dealer, for an auctioneer, actually, an antique auctioneer.

47:48.028 --> 47:51.071
And we must have once talked about this.

47:51.091 --> 47:53.433
And I said to him, no, I really only collect books and paper.

47:53.634 --> 47:54.394
And he said, paper?

47:54.414 --> 47:59.099
He wasn't even familiar with the term paper as, you know, posters, playbills.

47:59.800 --> 48:02.383
And I said, yeah, magicians, posters, and playbills.

48:02.403 --> 48:04.225
And he said, oh, I have a poster of a magician.

48:04.778 --> 48:10.428
And he walked out, and he came back with perhaps the most common poster a man who didn't collect magic would have.

48:10.448 --> 48:12.171
It was a magician named Alexander.

48:12.211 --> 48:18.061
When I was a kid in New York, I used to be around the village for a dollar apiece, and now they're, of course, worth much more.

48:18.201 --> 48:28.980
But a great poster of this magician, Claude Alexander Conlon, with a big question mark around his turban was fashioned into a question mark, and it said, Alexander at the top, the man who knows.

48:29.230 --> 48:36.457
And the printer on these posters was of Yaga Bombay, which I'm sure was done to make it look exotic, because Conlon was from the Midwest.

48:36.837 --> 48:38.559
He'd probably never been to India in his life.

48:38.579 --> 48:40.160
The poster was probably printed in Hoboken.

48:40.180 --> 48:42.042
I mean, all of this made it great fun.

48:42.362 --> 48:48.708
But it was a startling image, you know, this classic profiled face with this turban into a question mark, the man who knows.

48:48.748 --> 48:50.630
I said to him, oh, that's very nice.

48:50.710 --> 48:51.791
And he said, are you interested in this?

48:51.811 --> 48:52.812
I said, well, I have it.

48:53.513 --> 48:54.594
You know, but it's terrific.

48:54.634 --> 48:55.715
Thanks for showing it to me.

48:56.135 --> 48:56.656
You know, what's up?

48:56.676 --> 48:57.677
Is the science?

48:57.697 --> 48:57.837
No, no.

48:58.728 --> 49:04.619
So then he says, you know, we sit down, we have a beer, and he says, I've got a poster of comedians.

49:04.659 --> 49:05.501
Do you want to see that?

49:06.663 --> 49:09.448
Well, anybody who's like, you know better than to say no.

49:09.568 --> 49:12.334
He hauls out a six-sheet poster.

49:12.995 --> 49:13.496
Six-sheet.

49:13.676 --> 49:14.959
Six-sheet poster.

49:15.059 --> 49:17.824
An enormous poster.

49:17.844 --> 49:20.449
And on the top it says, Comedians de Mephisto.

49:21.374 --> 49:25.878
And the Comedians de Mephisto was a name for one of the most famous magic acts in the world.

49:25.999 --> 49:29.122
It was a subtitle for the act of Leroy, Thoma, and Bosco.

49:29.462 --> 49:30.723
So he has your attention now.

49:30.743 --> 49:31.784
He has my attention.

49:31.924 --> 49:34.147
I have never seen this poster in my life.

49:34.167 --> 49:37.370
I have now started to salivate into my beer.

49:38.991 --> 49:43.696
Sergei Leroy was a great Belgian illusionist who invented one of the most famous magic illusions in the world.

49:45.177 --> 49:47.520
The illusion was called the Azra Levitation.

49:47.740 --> 49:49.862
You've probably seen it because it's still done to this day.

49:50.737 --> 50:08.712
A woman was put on a couch and covered with a sheet, and he would make passes, and she would, you know, levitate under the sheet and go up above his head to almost the full extent of his arms outstretched over his head, and then he would whip the cloth away, and there would be no one there.

50:08.732 --> 50:09.232
Good trick.

50:09.252 --> 50:10.674
I mean, great, great effect.

50:10.694 --> 50:11.775
He was a brilliant inventor.

50:12.976 --> 50:16.479
And he did this act with his wife, you know, Leroy Toma in Bosco.

50:16.519 --> 50:20.642
His wife, Toma, was an English woman named Mary Ford, who was a wonderful coin manipulator.

50:21.044 --> 50:25.830
And then Bosco initially was a fellow named Leo Bosco, Leon Bosco, who was a comedy entertainer.

50:25.850 --> 50:29.055
And then another interesting man took over the job as Bosco.

50:29.075 --> 50:35.924
This was a guy named Dr. James William Elliott, who was a Harvard medical man who gave up his medical practice to do magic.

50:35.964 --> 50:38.106
Yeah, it was a wonderful story.

50:38.147 --> 50:42.813
He used to rent, he's from Boston, and he rented two hotel rooms whenever he traveled.

50:43.253 --> 50:46.558
And one, he would just have a chair and a table and a deck of cards in.

50:47.259 --> 50:50.663
And he would go into this room all day long and practice, and he'd build himself as a fiction.

50:50.930 --> 50:54.933
the champion, the challenge card champion in the world.

50:54.994 --> 51:02.260
And he would elicit the responses of other people to meet him in some test of magical skills.

51:02.780 --> 51:08.145
And when Vernon was a boy, you know, he had a wonderful session where he fooled Elliot and they became great friends.

51:08.225 --> 51:10.066
And, you know, so again, it lives that way.

51:10.086 --> 51:11.908
I mean, I have a certain sense that I know Elliot.

51:11.928 --> 51:16.072
And we also have five manuscript notebooks of Dr. Elliot in the Mulholland Library.

51:16.112 --> 51:19.975
So again, part of this whole link, some of it, which is attached to the books and manuscripts,

51:20.225 --> 51:22.107
And some of it, which comes from people.

51:22.127 --> 51:28.015
And I do techniques in my work that come from Eliot that I was taught from Vernon, and that's wonderful.

51:28.035 --> 51:29.176
How did you connect with Vernon?

51:29.236 --> 51:31.118
Oh, so you brought this poster by the way.

51:31.138 --> 51:33.121
Well, no, I mean, the story's even better than that.

51:33.181 --> 51:34.503
I'll go back to that.

51:34.523 --> 51:42.132
So now, not only that, the story's printed by my, the poster's printed by my favorite printer, this great lithographer in Hamburg, Adolf Friedlander.

51:42.517 --> 51:49.450
It's a staggering image with cauldrons and animals and devils and the three people, Leroy, Tomlin, and Bosco, and it's six years.

51:49.510 --> 51:50.752
I've never seen this one.

51:50.772 --> 51:55.922
It's about the size of that mirror, almost exactly the size of this whole three-part mirror.

51:56.242 --> 51:59.268
And now I look at it... Probably looking at 20 feet by 12 feet, something like that.

51:59.288 --> 52:06.381
I don't know if it was quite that long, but... I mean, you can see, you know, all three...

52:07.492 --> 52:09.375
Well, you can figure it out pretty much.

52:09.455 --> 52:14.302
A standard one sheet is 28 by 40, so you just, you know, picture three times that, you know.

52:17.166 --> 52:19.450
So, I look at this thing and I say, boy.

52:19.650 --> 52:21.012
And the condition of Jesus Christ.

52:21.212 --> 52:29.124
Well, it's mounted on brown craft paper, which is, you know, certainly not the way you would conservatorially mount anything like that, but it was in surprisingly good condition.

52:29.745 --> 52:31.548
You know, it's a piece right around the turn of the century.

52:32.770 --> 52:33.010
And...

52:34.120 --> 52:38.186
In those days, I had never even seen many Friedlander pieces of that size.

52:38.266 --> 52:41.632
I mean, I was just taken aback.

52:41.992 --> 52:43.274
Just a karate guy.

52:43.314 --> 52:45.978
Right, a karate guy whose house I could see from mine.

52:46.519 --> 52:49.704
So I call up two of the biggest poster collectors I know, my great friends of mine.

52:49.724 --> 52:51.787
They've never even heard of this piece.

52:51.808 --> 52:56.395
Anyway, this guy now says, do you like this?

52:56.415 --> 52:58.558
And I say, yeah, I like this a lot.

52:58.775 --> 53:04.141
And, you know, you're fed with this funny thing about how much do you have bought over it, and how much don't you, you know, what's going to happen here?

53:04.702 --> 53:07.745
And the guy said, do you have a place big enough to hold it?

53:07.765 --> 53:14.493
And I said, I know this is going to sound crazy, but I swear to you, my living room wall looks like it was made for this poster.

53:14.513 --> 53:15.654
Okay, that's the first thing I said.

53:15.694 --> 53:18.237
And he says, let's see.

53:18.417 --> 53:20.900
And I say, what?

53:21.581 --> 53:25.305
And we walk over, he puts the poster under his arm, and we walk over the canal.

53:25.673 --> 53:30.982
And we walk to my house and we put it up at this wall and it looks like the wall is made for this puzzle.

53:31.683 --> 53:33.606
And he says, well, you might as well have it.

53:34.908 --> 53:36.651
And I say, well, this is terrific.

53:36.691 --> 53:37.553
What do you want for it?

53:37.613 --> 53:39.656
And he says, no, no, you might as well have it.

53:41.159 --> 53:43.643
And he gives me this puzzle.

53:43.703 --> 53:45.446
Just pretty wonderful.

53:45.466 --> 53:47.930
And we wouldn't even speculate, right?

53:47.950 --> 53:49.072
Well, there's no point.

53:49.092 --> 53:50.054
There's no point.

53:50.094 --> 53:50.955
But I mean, it's just...

53:51.205 --> 53:52.947
It's one of those wonderful stories.

53:52.967 --> 54:00.918
How did this poster of a Belgian magician printed in Germany wind up in a house five doors away from me on a canal in Venice?

54:00.938 --> 54:01.699
That's the way he got it.

54:02.480 --> 54:07.347
Yeah, and he didn't really... The story wasn't interesting enough for me to remember.

54:07.407 --> 54:09.550
It came with some stuff.

54:09.650 --> 54:10.751
And here's the other poster.

54:10.771 --> 54:12.133
It's the most common.

54:12.333 --> 54:15.416
And that's the first one he showed you.

54:15.436 --> 54:17.358
That's the one you were going to like.

54:17.378 --> 54:19.280
And I mean, you know, there's so many interesting.

54:19.700 --> 54:21.182
How about manuscript material?

54:21.402 --> 54:24.365
Do you collect manuscript material?

54:24.385 --> 54:28.208
Because I would think that ultimately, if you're a serious collector, you have to go to manuscripts.

54:28.929 --> 54:37.017
I mean, I think anybody who's serious, particularly anybody who's writing history, you know, wants to find their original source material.

54:37.037 --> 54:39.319
One of the manuscripts I own that's fun is

54:40.480 --> 54:45.986
I own the manuscript of the memoirs of Count Joseph Borlowski, the celebrated Polish dwarf.

54:47.007 --> 54:48.168
That's a great story, too.

54:48.689 --> 54:55.756
He was, you know, he spanned the 18th and early 19th centuries, and he was a Polish dwarf who was a favorite in the courts of Europe.

54:56.738 --> 55:06.488
And I have this beautifully, you know, calligraphed, I mean, not in some cursive style, but, you know, a beautiful round hand.

55:07.244 --> 55:09.987
of his memoirs, which were published in both French and English.

55:10.007 --> 55:12.250
I mean, his famous memoir, first published in the 1790s.

55:12.750 --> 55:28.107
But the story that's so great about Berlowski is that, you know, dwarfs traditionally didn't live very long, and apparently he took an annuity out on his life when he was around 80 or so, and completely bankrupted the people who took out his annuity because he lived to be well into his 90s, you know.

55:28.527 --> 55:31.391
And so that's one of, you know, I'm sure I have other manuscripts as well.

55:31.411 --> 55:37.217
That's one of the ones that just comes... Speaking for yourself now, a lot of the effects that you've created

55:38.564 --> 55:42.088
Why are you not interested in publishing them and keeping them secret?

55:42.108 --> 55:43.250
Do you record them?

55:43.330 --> 55:44.111
Do you write them down?

55:44.712 --> 55:46.273
I have to confess I'm pretty bad at it.

55:46.794 --> 55:47.094
You don't?

55:47.315 --> 55:49.858
I don't religiously do it at all.

55:49.878 --> 55:53.302
And my memory is such that I've forgotten quite a few things.

55:53.342 --> 55:55.705
So you really haven't documented this stuff?

55:56.226 --> 56:00.811
I mean, certainly not the way you would think someone who's a curator and historian should.

56:00.831 --> 56:02.013
No, the answer is no.

56:02.073 --> 56:02.473
I haven't.

56:02.493 --> 56:04.496
I've got to turn this before it runs out.

56:04.656 --> 56:05.517
I'm going to turn it right now.
