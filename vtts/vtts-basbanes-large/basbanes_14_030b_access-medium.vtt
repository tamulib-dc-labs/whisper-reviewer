WEBVTT

00:01.752 --> 00:11.446
We've used the word definitive a couple of times in the last couple of minutes here.

00:12.548 --> 00:22.482
It's my hope and belief that once this bibliography is published it will become the definitive work in the sense that it will be cited.

00:23.383 --> 00:25.887
You know how the citations, guns and

00:26.120 --> 00:30.425
You're right, there's hundreds of them.

00:31.266 --> 00:32.648
And she's alive, by the way.

00:32.728 --> 00:33.489
Really?

00:35.131 --> 00:35.631
Look at this.

00:36.452 --> 00:46.023
As we speak, Carol comes walking out with an armful of these huge loose-leaf notebooks, I would say probably 12 inches high at least.

00:47.185 --> 00:48.807
This is a sample.

00:50.589 --> 00:55.114
This is benign fanaticism?

00:56.123 --> 00:56.624
I like that.

00:56.724 --> 00:58.067
Well, that's a gentle madness.

00:58.288 --> 00:58.689
That's right.

00:58.769 --> 01:00.553
There you go.

01:00.653 --> 01:02.036
I coined a phrase for this.

01:02.056 --> 01:02.577
Nice phrase.

01:02.597 --> 01:03.199
And she has it.

01:03.239 --> 01:04.181
Nice term.

01:04.281 --> 01:06.105
Everything is beautifully organized.

01:06.225 --> 01:08.510
Connie, this is my wife I'm talking to right now.

01:08.631 --> 01:09.372
Look how beautiful she's.

01:09.412 --> 01:11.517
My wife is organizing my stuff.

01:12.492 --> 01:29.816
What I have done is every time I have received a letter from an author, illustrator, or even from a university library, I have made a copy for my own files, put it in glassine, so it's as perfect for the next person seeing it as it was for me when I received it in the mail.

01:30.537 --> 01:37.346
And something we really didn't touch on, I think that what I'm doing is trying to preserve this for future scholars.

01:37.366 --> 01:38.027
I think that

01:38.243 --> 02:04.504
will be a lot of interest in the literature of the 30s and 40s as time goes on and this will have give people a chance to read what the authors and the alice critics themselves had to say oh you're doing much more than that this would and you're coming along at a time when there's not much time left a lot of these people uh you're you're losing we're losing them waters in particular you mentioned

02:04.754 --> 02:07.777
You got there precisely at the right time, undoubtedly.

02:08.077 --> 02:10.760
Several others do have done since.

02:10.840 --> 02:12.482
Can you figure that out?

02:12.582 --> 02:19.830
You know, the one I want to... I did this last week, and it was getting out of an alphabetical order.

02:19.950 --> 02:24.294
Well, they've always been alphabetical order, but... Here's Jim Dunn.

02:25.936 --> 02:30.721
Here's the guy who wrote the Allagash, Lou... D-U-N-N Dunn?

02:31.302 --> 02:32.723
Yeah.

02:32.843 --> 02:33.664
Lou Deeps wrote...

02:35.517 --> 02:41.223
She even saves the envelopes that the material comes in, everything.

02:43.285 --> 02:52.474
Lou Dietz, who wrote The Allagash, wrote, and this is back in probably 1991, Dear Carol Fitzgerald, enjoyed hearing from you.

02:52.995 --> 02:56.398
Writers aren't supposed to retire, but I must confess that I have.

02:56.739 --> 02:59.141
At 85, even typing has become a chore.

02:59.201 --> 03:01.343
I'll try to answer some of your questions.

03:02.104 --> 03:04.967
I was active in main democratic politics back then.

03:05.133 --> 03:08.678
It was Ed Muskie who suggested I do the book on the Allagash.

03:09.118 --> 03:10.740
Ed promised to write the foreword.

03:11.181 --> 03:17.168
The only other edition is a paperback issue by North Country Press, Thorndike Maine.

03:17.589 --> 03:21.954
As I recall, a proposal and early chapters were submitted to Holt.

03:21.974 --> 03:23.436
The project was accepted.

03:23.897 --> 03:26.180
This was handled by my agency in New York.

03:26.821 --> 03:29.985
I knew Maine's North Country, and I'd run the river a number of times.

03:30.525 --> 03:32.688
At the time, I was working for Field and Stream.

03:33.129 --> 03:34.971
Also, I'd written several books for...

03:35.170 --> 03:36.932
young people, the Maine woods.

03:37.032 --> 03:40.235
In any event, the Allagash appeared to be an ideal project for me.

03:40.555 --> 03:41.816
Not much else I can tell you.

03:41.836 --> 03:42.877
Trust is helpful.

03:43.157 --> 03:44.599
That's great.

03:44.619 --> 03:47.021
Ed Muskie was a base graduate.

03:47.041 --> 03:49.083
Yeah, and a great American.

03:49.123 --> 03:52.786
Got a great American.

03:52.806 --> 03:56.850
It's a tragic life in a way, really.

03:56.970 --> 04:00.173
Who made the fatal mistake of crying.

04:00.193 --> 04:01.974
Yeah, like a German man cries.

04:02.034 --> 04:03.996
Like I started crying just now, thinking

04:05.393 --> 04:15.465
He was being attacked by the Manchester Union leader.

04:15.545 --> 04:18.689
That was a great man.

04:19.130 --> 04:23.295
And he cried and it killed him politically.

04:23.355 --> 04:25.798
Do you know the name Frederick Gouton, by any chance?

04:26.579 --> 04:29.563
He wrote Beacon Tomic.

04:30.143 --> 04:32.346
You might not, but he was...

04:32.596 --> 04:35.359
This is all correspondence that you've exchanged with these offices.

04:35.759 --> 04:36.020
Exactly.

04:36.040 --> 04:37.221
Now, you asked for some other names.

04:37.241 --> 04:38.823
There's one at Gutham.

04:38.843 --> 04:39.423
How do we spell?

04:39.743 --> 04:40.825
G-U-T-H-E-I-M.

04:40.985 --> 04:42.606
First of all, Frederick with a K?

04:43.527 --> 04:46.731
Frederick with a K. Yes.

04:46.751 --> 04:47.251
G-U-T-H-E-I-M.

04:47.532 --> 04:48.393
And he wrote which book?

04:48.773 --> 04:49.914
The Potomac.

04:49.934 --> 04:50.635
Oh, the Potomac.

04:51.055 --> 04:56.041
He had a major effect on the architecture of the city of Washington, the metro system.

04:56.601 --> 04:58.303
He was a distinguished city planner.

04:59.564 --> 05:00.325
He's one of the...

05:01.570 --> 05:03.733
Godfathers in modern-day Washington, D.C.

05:05.115 --> 05:07.017
Carol, have you read all these books, all 65?

05:07.097 --> 05:07.237
No.

05:07.337 --> 05:07.478
No.

05:08.619 --> 05:11.463
Do you read any of them for pleasure?

05:11.943 --> 05:15.588
I will tell you that we were in Norway this past summer.

05:15.608 --> 05:22.837
We had a three-week vacation in Norway, and I knew that my gallery talk at Vanderbilt was looming.

05:22.898 --> 05:24.139
You might take these two books back.

05:24.159 --> 05:28.725
I feel uncomfortable having this tape recorded on top of them.

05:28.958 --> 05:38.612
It was September 15th, and I felt that if I was going to speak at Vanderbilt University, I should have read Donald Davidson's two volumes on the Tennessee River.

05:39.093 --> 05:54.696
So we are going through the fioris of Norway, and we're just admiring the scenery, and I'm desperately reading the two volumes on the Tennessee, and then on the flight back I read Goodread to Kentucky by Dr. Clark.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.782
No, I have not read it.

05:57.022 --> 05:59.345
Obviously, this has taken on an energy of its own.

05:59.425 --> 06:03.730
I mean, it's certainly not a passion for the content, or is it a passion for the content?

06:03.750 --> 06:04.691
Not particularly.

06:04.711 --> 06:07.194
I think it's a passion for the project is what it is.

06:07.895 --> 06:17.706
And I try to familiarize myself with the contents of the books, knowing that the writers put a great deal of effort and time into writing.

06:18.246 --> 06:22.371
But my energy has been important.

06:22.891 --> 06:25.674
and making sure that I'm preserving what I can.

06:26.655 --> 06:28.256
Wow, that's so great.

06:28.276 --> 06:34.822
And is this something that more or less developed as a conceptual thing for you?

06:34.842 --> 06:39.987
At what point did you say, I'm doing something scholarly and very important?

06:40.027 --> 06:50.097
I think that when I started receiving responses, such as this from Frederick Gutine, and I realized how important these people were in their crimes,

06:50.549 --> 07:05.071
that I had history to preserve, and I really had an obligation, not only to these people who were dying, but I had an obligation to scholars, future scholars, to present this, or to preserve it somewhere.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.815
So it would be a biography of Good Time.

07:07.835 --> 07:10.679
He was that big person in the Washington Post.

07:10.699 --> 07:11.661
He died in Washington Post.

07:11.701 --> 07:12.602
Somebody will come along.

07:13.764 --> 07:16.608
If they're smart, they'll come along and they'll look at this correspondence.

07:16.889 --> 07:18.531
Now let me ask a question.

07:19.220 --> 07:22.063
From the Washington Post.

07:22.504 --> 07:24.807
A Guiding Light of Architecture.

07:24.827 --> 07:29.913
And that's... The New York Times.

07:29.953 --> 07:35.559
What's the date of the obit?

07:36.020 --> 07:38.823
October 4, 1993.

07:40.425 --> 07:43.789
So that one you just kind of got made, didn't you?

07:43.809 --> 07:44.289
Yeah.

07:44.309 --> 07:45.431
And how old was he at his death?

07:45.751 --> 07:47.353
85.

07:48.042 --> 07:50.264
I had two people die.

07:51.065 --> 08:08.561
The Mohawk, written in 1949, I believe, was written by Codron Husslup, who was the University of Chicago, and illustrated by Lothario Calafon, who was a very accomplished artist from the Chicago area.

08:08.581 --> 08:17.509
They both wrote to me letters, and they both died, so I was able to meld the two into the book, and I would have missed them.

08:17.641 --> 08:20.483
And they both have stories to tell me.

08:20.543 --> 08:25.408
May I do this, just for the enduring value of this, because I love this woman so much.

08:26.148 --> 08:27.870
It'll take 30 seconds on your tape.

08:28.550 --> 08:32.714
This is the way Marjorie Stoneman Douglas opens her book, The Everglades.

08:33.435 --> 08:35.997
Chapter 1, The Nature of the Everglades.

08:36.017 --> 08:39.460
Part 1, The Name.

08:39.480 --> 08:41.522
There are no other Everglades in the world.

08:42.422 --> 08:46.686
They are, they always have been, one of the unique regions of the earth.

08:46.953 --> 09:13.618
remote never wholly known nothing anywhere else is like them their vast glittering openness wider than the enormous visible round of the horizon the racing free saltness and sweetness of their massive winds under the dazzling blue heights of space they are also unique also in the simplicity the diversity the related harmony of the forms of life they enclose

09:14.358 --> 09:21.986
The miracle of the light pours over the green ground expanse of sawgrass and of water shining and slow-moving below.

09:22.006 --> 09:22.826
It's poetry, really.

09:22.846 --> 09:23.307
Exactly.

09:23.327 --> 09:29.533
The grass and water that is the meaning of the central fact of the Everglades of Florida.

09:29.553 --> 09:32.055
It is a river of grass.

09:32.076 --> 09:32.976
Wow.

09:32.996 --> 09:33.077
Yes.

09:33.717 --> 09:33.897
Wow.

09:36.240 --> 09:39.223
That lady is our patron.

09:39.283 --> 09:39.783
Thank you.

09:40.123 --> 09:43.707
I love those concluding lines that always

09:44.311 --> 09:46.453
just capture it.

09:47.254 --> 09:48.755
I don't need this one.

09:48.815 --> 09:50.317
I was giving it to Alderaan.

09:50.397 --> 09:51.918
I hope it's easier to say.

09:51.939 --> 09:54.401
I've also... No, that's irrelevant.

09:54.481 --> 09:56.223
Let's go ahead.

09:56.243 --> 09:57.924
I was going to say something that's not relevant.

09:57.944 --> 09:58.505
No, we should.

09:59.005 --> 09:59.246
Go ahead.

09:59.266 --> 10:04.231
I was just going to tell you, I've also been collecting photographs of these people.

10:04.591 --> 10:06.032
So you're building an archive.

10:09.676 --> 10:11.137
Let me ask a question.

10:11.338 --> 10:12.799
What do you foresee

10:13.201 --> 10:17.885
donation of the books and all these papers to an invitation.

10:17.905 --> 10:31.857
I'm not sure where, but it would have to be someone or someplace that would guarantee that they are not going to break up the publishing history of the series, that everything is going to be available.

10:32.237 --> 10:35.960
I don't think I could do what I have done again.

10:36.541 --> 10:38.102
The books simply don't exist.

10:38.302 --> 10:40.504
I've got feelers out all the time.

10:41.225 --> 10:42.786
You can get the first edition

10:43.222 --> 10:46.426
but you could not find all the subsequent printing.

10:46.446 --> 10:54.257
Just make sure, take it for one, that you get that very clearly stated in writing.

10:54.357 --> 10:59.924
And if they break it up in any way, the whole collection reverts.

10:59.944 --> 11:02.187
In your book, there is a library.

11:02.207 --> 11:06.613
Well, that's Samuel Pepys, and there's a fellow, and I'm writing about for this new book, Lloyd Coatsen.

11:07.741 --> 11:09.964
who has given this enormous library to Princeton.

11:10.004 --> 11:14.030
It's all children's books, and the story behind that is unbelievable.

11:14.050 --> 11:18.136
He owned the Neutrogena Company, and he just sold it for a billion dollars.

11:18.897 --> 11:25.666
But his wife and his son were murdered in 1979 by somebody who was stalking him.

11:25.866 --> 11:31.634
And his life, basically, you talk about having everything but having nothing at the same time.

11:32.255 --> 11:37.022
And what he's doing is creating this library in memory of this child and the wife, and it's gone.

11:37.441 --> 11:46.274
And the deal is, and he said he took this out of my book, if they don't do what he wants with the collection at Princeton, he's pulling it out and giving it to UCLA.

11:46.775 --> 11:52.884
And I'm sure he has the best lawyers in the world working on that.

11:53.364 --> 11:55.487
But this is such an important archive.

11:55.547 --> 11:56.869
You really have to make sure.

11:56.969 --> 11:59.052
It'll become more important with time.

11:59.113 --> 12:01.776
Right now is still fairly modern.

12:01.877 --> 12:03.920
Of course, but that's the measure of a great collection.

12:04.180 --> 12:06.283
Yeah, exactly.

12:06.989 --> 12:10.679
Now, I'm sure that the Library of Congress must be wooing you.

12:11.621 --> 12:14.007
John Paul was very honest with me.

12:14.348 --> 12:22.028
Not that they wouldn't want the books, but he told me that they would separate the correspondence

12:22.278 --> 12:47.492
and my files from the books he said that's just the way they do things i don't think that would be conducive to doing a litter um you know we might be in adjacent rooms you know i don't know i think they're in separate parts of the library the truth is the broward county library is desperate i like the broward county here the library we love the library of the year 1996 in the united states would

12:47.827 --> 12:50.010
very much like to have this whole collection.

12:50.030 --> 12:50.230
Very much.

12:50.390 --> 13:03.527
And it would also be, I'm certainly not trying to, you know, my sense is that this would be the cornerstone collection, whereas at the Library of Commerce they have 120 million items, and things get lost that day.

13:04.108 --> 13:04.508
We know that.

13:04.588 --> 13:06.231
They lost the map of the Rivers of America.

13:06.271 --> 13:07.352
You don't even know about the map.

13:08.213 --> 13:08.654
It's right there.

13:08.814 --> 13:10.316
They get lost and they get stolen.

13:11.117 --> 13:16.804
I'm just saying that off the record, you know, but...

13:19.147 --> 13:23.291
This would be one of many, many, many, many, many, many collections.

13:23.311 --> 13:23.752
That's right.

13:24.052 --> 13:25.974
It'll be a success.

13:27.195 --> 13:35.904
But the main thing is I don't know if our library here can handle the volumes over the years if we're fairly small.

13:36.304 --> 13:39.487
You also want to scrawl the apparatus, so you have to balance things.

13:39.527 --> 13:40.929
You have to show them our professionals.

13:41.409 --> 13:42.811
We'll handle it.

13:43.351 --> 13:44.713
Oh, we'll get a color line?

13:44.733 --> 13:44.913
Okay.

13:45.333 --> 13:47.095
I think you might come in here and call.

13:47.362 --> 13:47.943
Okay.

13:47.963 --> 13:51.046
Thank God you had this tape recorder.

13:51.066 --> 13:52.207
Well, I'm glad we had a few.

13:52.247 --> 13:53.348
Batteries, huh?

13:53.428 --> 13:54.429
Are you recording?

13:54.529 --> 13:55.049
Yeah, I'm on.

13:55.069 --> 13:59.314
I'm just going to... This is the working mess.

13:59.534 --> 13:59.794
Uh-huh.

13:59.814 --> 14:00.615
These are my files.

14:01.235 --> 14:08.502
I work in here all the time, so I haven't, you know, neatened them up, but everything is sort of... What do you need to read?

14:09.363 --> 14:12.426
And this is the manuscript here, as I'm working on it.

14:12.446 --> 14:13.247
Double shelves.

14:13.347 --> 14:16.390
I know that I have... You found the pink...

14:16.673 --> 14:23.641
These pages are the final draft and the white pages are... When are you projecting a completed manuscript?

14:27.245 --> 14:28.647
It could happen this year.

14:28.727 --> 14:29.208
Oh, really?

14:29.228 --> 14:30.069
So you're that close?

14:30.089 --> 14:31.170
It's pretty close.

14:31.330 --> 14:36.016
We're just going through, doing some final editing.

14:36.036 --> 14:42.343
We're making sure that we have all the information and making sure that it's accurate.

14:42.543 --> 14:44.626
Here are the American Life series.

14:44.646 --> 14:46.489
There's the American Folkway series.

14:47.571 --> 14:49.834
These were all published about the same time.

14:50.476 --> 14:54.402
The Murder series.

14:54.422 --> 14:57.366
Now, was this a similar formal series, the Lake series?

14:57.967 --> 14:58.668
Yes.

14:58.688 --> 15:00.992
I see Marjorie Kinnon Rawlings, Cross Creek.

15:01.012 --> 15:02.995
Now, I notice you have Mark Twain.

15:03.015 --> 15:05.099
That must be, you know, Life in the Mississippi.

15:05.119 --> 15:07.943
Now, that clearly was outside of the...

15:08.176 --> 15:12.022
The boundaries of the... Here's a really sick collector.

15:12.283 --> 15:13.785
This is mine, not hers.

15:13.805 --> 15:14.326
Oh, I see.

15:14.587 --> 15:15.608
I have all of the libraries.

15:15.628 --> 15:16.510
I have every library.

15:16.530 --> 15:20.596
You have an open, really sick collector.

15:20.717 --> 15:22.620
But we collect a lot of things.

15:22.640 --> 15:23.922
I mean, not just the river.

15:23.942 --> 15:29.050
But before you get away from Ceres Americanans, if you want to see some really beautiful books, look at these.

15:29.070 --> 15:29.992
These are the ports.

15:30.012 --> 15:31.474
I don't know what the series was called.

15:31.494 --> 15:32.416
Seaport series.

15:32.456 --> 15:33.137
Seaport series.

15:33.691 --> 15:34.912
And let me, which is one?

15:34.992 --> 15:35.813
They're all good, aren't they?

15:36.274 --> 15:37.315
So we see Baltimore.

15:37.355 --> 15:38.977
We see the Northwest Gateway.

15:39.057 --> 15:40.399
We see the Port of Gloucester.

15:40.539 --> 15:42.641
We see Golden Gate, which is San Francisco.

15:42.661 --> 15:43.843
Look at the books.

15:43.863 --> 15:45.124
They are beautifully made.

15:45.965 --> 15:47.647
Are these carols or yours or both?

15:47.667 --> 15:48.248
These are carols.

15:48.568 --> 15:48.948
Look at this.

15:50.690 --> 15:51.611
They are magnificent.

15:52.472 --> 15:56.277
We should point out that you are a retired naval officer.

15:56.297 --> 15:56.397
I am.

15:56.497 --> 15:59.260
So there is an interest here, I assume, in...

15:59.797 --> 16:04.804
But I've also been working in the maritime industry since I retired in 1974.

16:04.965 --> 16:05.826
I see.

16:06.246 --> 16:07.368
In one connection or another.

16:07.889 --> 16:11.254
Basically doing what kinds of things, might I ask?

16:11.374 --> 16:18.344
Well, right now I'm in a shipping company that operates chemical carriers, petroleum tankers, harbor togs.

16:18.384 --> 16:19.886
The home office is here.

16:21.108 --> 16:22.770
Many of our vessels are in the Gulf of Mexico.

16:24.112 --> 16:28.639
We have one here, the pamphlet from the 1500s.

16:29.058 --> 16:32.644
computation with Daniel Johnson.

16:32.664 --> 16:34.046
This is a 17th century book.

16:35.348 --> 16:35.869
Yeah.

16:35.889 --> 16:37.151
And what does this fit into?

16:37.391 --> 16:37.952
Nothing.

16:38.012 --> 16:38.353
Nothing.

16:38.373 --> 16:39.615
We're not really going to do that.

16:40.616 --> 16:44.262
We have, everything's triple shelves.

16:44.362 --> 16:44.903
Oh, yeah.

16:44.923 --> 16:52.195
I do have a complete set of every book that Carl Hyasson has written, and they're all signed and inscribed to me.

16:52.235 --> 16:53.897
This goes back to when he was going to write it.

16:53.917 --> 16:55.680
It's Hillary Masters book right there.

16:55.700 --> 16:56.521
Inscribed.

16:56.541 --> 16:56.922
Yeah.

16:57.880 --> 17:02.484
He's given me good information on his father, and he's been very kind.

17:03.585 --> 17:05.246
I have an inscribed copy of that as well.

17:05.306 --> 17:11.252
He was a writer of residence at Clark University, so I interviewed him when he was there.

17:11.792 --> 17:22.781
I have a fairly substantial reference library for writing and art books and books on the Depression era.

17:22.801 --> 17:26.925
I have found that in any other room I have a lot of them.

17:27.766 --> 17:33.993
There's still some Federalist projects behind here somewhere.

17:34.394 --> 17:36.957
It's something else that we've gotten into, Carol's gotten into.

17:36.977 --> 17:39.279
You see this book on the Potomac.

17:39.299 --> 17:41.582
That is not Gutheim's book, the Potomac.

17:42.103 --> 17:48.030
You see this book here, this line here, the Illinois River.

17:48.070 --> 17:51.654
This is not part of the series of America, rivers of America.

17:51.714 --> 17:52.575
That's the juvenile.

17:52.825 --> 17:54.029
But it's a juvenile.

17:54.109 --> 17:55.212
It's based on that.

17:55.273 --> 17:55.493
Uh-huh.

17:55.533 --> 17:56.497
So it's important.

17:56.517 --> 17:58.362
River for America series for young readers.

17:58.382 --> 17:58.724
Right.

17:58.744 --> 18:02.596
So you'll certainly have to mention that then, won't you, in some way?

18:02.796 --> 18:06.548
And I have my friends at the National Art Club who keep feeding me information.

18:06.899 --> 18:10.263
And they're ready to, he said, your book party will be a super hit.

18:10.283 --> 18:12.946
They're already giving me a book party to make sure it's a club.

18:13.567 --> 18:14.428
You know where that is?

18:14.448 --> 18:15.129
That's great.

18:15.209 --> 18:15.509
I don't.

18:15.749 --> 18:20.255
I know where that's, that's where the Players Club is.

18:20.275 --> 18:21.837
Right next door.

18:21.937 --> 18:22.397
Right next door.

18:22.417 --> 18:22.738
Okay, yeah.

18:22.758 --> 18:28.985
So anyway, this is, this is the, the working room here.

18:29.005 --> 18:31.007
This is great.

18:31.027 --> 18:33.871
So Updike is here because you like Updike, I guess.

18:34.371 --> 18:36.754
We sort of started collecting Updike and then

18:36.920 --> 18:38.422
Gave it up, I think.

18:38.442 --> 18:41.326
Well, you have rabbit... Yeah, we've got the rabbits.

18:41.567 --> 18:42.428
Do you have the rabbit runs?

18:42.488 --> 18:43.129
No, we don't.

18:43.650 --> 18:45.652
That sprung's about $7.50.

18:45.813 --> 18:51.301
I interviewed John Updick about two months ago, and I brought along my rabbit run to have him inscribe it.

18:52.002 --> 18:56.388
So that gave it a little kick, didn't it?

18:57.369 --> 18:59.632
Henry Pitts was one of the illustrators.

18:59.673 --> 19:06.302
P-I-T-Z, Henry C. He's still the illustrator of the Allegheny, but of course here he's writing about...

19:07.278 --> 19:09.241
Right.

19:09.262 --> 19:14.290
And all sources that are used in these biographies, Carol's right, are credited, of course.

19:16.154 --> 19:20.982
But there's a nice interlife there between one of the illustrators.

19:21.042 --> 19:24.188
I just picked up lithographs of still Wind and Rock a couple of weeks ago.

19:25.390 --> 19:26.873
Anyway.

19:27.554 --> 19:29.738
There are some Gale research books up there.

19:29.858 --> 19:30.138
I see.

19:30.159 --> 19:31.040
You don't have to take them down.

19:31.060 --> 19:31.581
I know them.

19:32.067 --> 19:33.328
There's an ancient book.

19:33.409 --> 19:35.611
That's the history of book publishing in the United States.

19:35.631 --> 19:36.792
I finally found that.

19:36.853 --> 19:37.513
Oh, it's Belker.

19:37.533 --> 19:38.094
It's not Gail.

19:38.114 --> 19:38.615
I'm sorry.

19:39.736 --> 19:43.380
There's a Joseph Heller, a very fine book dealer in Washington, D.C.

19:43.580 --> 19:44.762
He sponsored the Brolier Club.

19:44.782 --> 19:46.504
Can I understand your opinion?

19:46.964 --> 19:49.888
I just became a member last year.

19:49.928 --> 19:52.010
Remembers.

19:52.090 --> 19:52.671
It's wonderful.

19:52.691 --> 19:54.853
I went to the dinner a couple of weeks ago, my first one.

19:54.913 --> 19:55.334
I loved it.

19:55.955 --> 19:58.918
We went through separate checks.

19:59.135 --> 19:59.516
Really.

19:59.576 --> 20:01.018
For both members separately.

20:01.118 --> 20:02.641
Amazing what they put you through.

20:03.102 --> 20:04.584
Really, really.

20:04.725 --> 20:06.768
I was just, I said, is this worth this?

20:06.788 --> 20:10.775
They kept asking me about the collection.

20:11.296 --> 20:14.381
We had to go in and be looked at and examined.

20:14.501 --> 20:15.804
I don't know what they're looking for.

20:16.264 --> 20:19.710
The cut of the jib, I guess, is basically what it was.

20:19.871 --> 20:23.657
It was one of my early loves.

20:24.397 --> 20:25.138
John O'Hara.

20:25.418 --> 20:37.614
You would make, are you familiar at all with the American Aquarian Society, which I was elected to last year, which has made lots of American history, which cuts off in 1876.

20:37.634 --> 20:39.977
Otherwise, this would be wonderful.

20:40.618 --> 20:46.646
That's about when the National Arts Club building was built.

20:46.666 --> 20:50.411
It was the residence of Samuel Tilton.

20:50.431 --> 20:51.332
Samuel Tilton.

20:53.118 --> 21:01.587
Now, how many lake books do you have?

21:01.627 --> 21:06.182
I see Lake Ontario, Lake Pontchartrain, Lake Huron, so you have them all.

21:07.664 --> 21:09.146
And how many were there in the series?

21:09.246 --> 21:09.727
Eleven.

21:09.747 --> 21:12.071
And what were the years for that?

21:12.411 --> 21:13.773
They were in the 40s.

21:13.914 --> 21:18.941
I haven't done a lot of research on this series.

21:18.961 --> 21:21.826
It's kind of hard to find that substantial.

21:21.846 --> 21:26.794
But was the concept similar, or was it just kind of a derivative thing?

21:27.034 --> 21:31.581
The concept with the rivers is terrific, the fact that how the civilization and the culture grew.

21:31.601 --> 21:32.322
I think that those were just...

21:32.926 --> 21:34.650
Something that made sense, yeah.

21:34.670 --> 21:37.898
I think a lot of stuff came out of the Federal Writers Project.

21:38.179 --> 21:42.329
We know Stetson Kennedy, who wrote this book in the American—what's the series called?

21:42.770 --> 21:43.612
American Folkways.

21:43.632 --> 21:44.394
American Folkways.

21:44.434 --> 21:45.516
We know Stetson quite well.

21:45.536 --> 21:46.599
He exposed the Klan.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.303
He wrote a book called I Wrote with the Klan.

21:48.383 --> 21:48.965
Oh, I know that book.

21:48.985 --> 21:50.428
He's an amazing man.

21:50.712 --> 21:56.020
And he says, he worked on the Florida State Guide with Sora and Neil Hurston.

21:56.641 --> 21:58.644
They worked together collecting folklore.

21:58.664 --> 22:03.771
And Stetson, who's the real character, said, he said, hell yes, it came out of the Federal Artists Project.

22:03.831 --> 22:06.696
We began looking at the country, began writing about the country.

22:06.776 --> 22:12.304
And what I've noticed, by the way, that there seems to be a good balance between men and women.

22:13.265 --> 22:14.587
Absolutely, yes.

22:14.607 --> 22:15.389
Women were writing it.

22:15.589 --> 22:18.373
They truly were.

22:18.573 --> 22:19.454
You mentioned Hurston.

22:19.474 --> 22:23.460
Were there any blacks who were African-Americans who wrote in this series?

22:23.480 --> 22:24.361
No, no.

22:24.782 --> 22:25.303
Not a woman.

22:25.323 --> 22:26.464
I don't know.

22:26.484 --> 22:29.288
And I wasn't sure what I was looking for at Faith Barnes.

22:29.308 --> 22:29.549
I know.

22:29.569 --> 22:30.430
That's what I was going to say.

22:30.470 --> 22:32.813
Faith Barnes was the last... I'll take you whenever you're ready to go.

22:32.833 --> 22:33.995
No, I want to take some pictures.

22:34.055 --> 22:36.599
Faith Barnes was the last editor of the Rivers of America.

22:37.220 --> 22:38.161
She edited this book.

22:39.803 --> 22:42.387
I'm on straight American duty.

22:42.721 --> 22:43.642
They have a home.

22:43.662 --> 22:44.163
I see it's a home.

22:44.183 --> 23:04.947
Now this map is, oh, we have a map of the history, lore, and legend of the rivers of America and of its people told in a series of books edited by Stephen Vincent Benet, accent on the E, and Carl Carmer, C-A-R-M-E-R, and published by Farah and Reinhardt-New York.

23:05.648 --> 23:06.349
That's wonderful.

23:06.910 --> 23:10.534
That is really a 1942 map.

23:10.852 --> 23:19.303
This is a photograph of a photo paper, but it was a paper map that was produced to promote the series.

23:19.323 --> 23:20.725
That's a facsimile of the map?

23:20.765 --> 23:21.567
That's pretty good.

23:23.609 --> 23:26.073
What's the origin of a facsimile, Mrs. Fitzgerald?

23:26.473 --> 23:30.038
Well, it came from Cleveland Public Library.

23:30.058 --> 23:36.547
It was used at the Vanderbilt exhibit in September.

23:36.567 --> 23:40.352
So they actually commissioned that to illustrate the exhibition, is that right?

23:41.918 --> 24:10.457
and then we have the ultimate ephemera search for curalists to find one of these because there were probably thousands of them sent out to book dealers all over the country but the problem with ephemera is that it was ephemeral right remember your days on the bridge when you looked in the ephemera that's right I'm going to shoot a couple pictures I have a sense we're going to have to

24:10.673 --> 24:12.915
I'm just going to let this run.

24:13.836 --> 24:16.039
Gary Wills is coming to Boston for his new book.

24:16.859 --> 24:17.500
Which is what?

24:19.142 --> 24:28.472
It's about John Wayne, believe it or not.

24:31.475 --> 24:32.636
What is that stuff there?

24:35.819 --> 24:38.882
That was a heavy thing.

24:39.103 --> 24:40.444
It wasn't a gun.

24:41.302 --> 25:03.124
When I graduated from Ole Miss, I worked briefly for

25:03.678 --> 25:12.330
some of the electronic personnel assistants there doing all their female hiring and their psychological testing.

25:12.670 --> 25:15.794
You know, back in those days we used to use the Wanderlick test.

25:15.814 --> 25:16.956
Remember that, Bunny Charm?

25:16.976 --> 25:17.156
No.

25:17.717 --> 25:26.809
The Wanderlick test was a test that determines your intelligence level.

25:27.370 --> 25:29.673
There was a Stanford Binet, I remember that one.

25:29.693 --> 25:31.035
It would be illegal.

25:31.353 --> 25:35.377
by today's employment standards.

25:35.457 --> 25:41.624
I hired the backing people and the young executives.

25:41.644 --> 25:57.141
I worked there for a couple of years until my first child was born and then I didn't work again until I was divorced in the late 70s and took a job with an aerial photography firm which I had for about

25:57.728 --> 25:59.872
nine months, going up in helicopters.

26:00.333 --> 26:01.916
I was Dr. Photography.

26:01.936 --> 26:11.195
I was sitting in the middle, passing the flight instructions back and forth, but there were no doors on the helicopter, and I got very scared.

26:11.255 --> 26:12.096
I know the sensation.

26:12.116 --> 26:19.551
I used to go up on the helo often, the plane guard helo, for launches, and I used to just hang out the

26:19.649 --> 26:22.794
We'd go in there shooting pictures or whatever.

26:23.295 --> 26:28.344
In Vietnam, I used to hang out almost horizontal.

26:29.906 --> 26:31.549
Let's take a few pictures, if we might.

26:31.609 --> 26:34.614
I'd like some singly and together, if that's okay.

26:35.335 --> 26:42.307
I'm not sure I have any official connection with the Georgians.

26:43.048 --> 26:45.893
Let me go out the script and go watch some pictures with you.

26:50.800 --> 26:52.422
My wife is my editor, too.

26:52.442 --> 26:58.810
That's nice.

26:58.830 --> 27:05.158
I'm a little tighter here.

27:05.819 --> 27:09.484
That's her problem she sometimes looks like.

27:09.504 --> 27:10.345
I do, I do.

27:10.405 --> 27:14.290
What's the little tense?

27:14.310 --> 27:18.235
Do you realize, Carol, some of your vests firsts are down on that chair.

27:18.275 --> 27:18.755
Do you care?

27:20.157 --> 27:20.217
No.

27:20.872 --> 27:22.194
For pictures?

27:22.474 --> 27:33.951
I don't think so.

27:34.151 --> 27:35.333
I like that.

27:36.234 --> 27:37.777
Let me just get a long shot.

27:38.297 --> 27:39.940
Miss Ole Miss.

27:42.183 --> 27:43.285
Miss Ole Miss.

27:43.585 --> 27:44.647
Miss Ole Miss.

27:45.808 --> 27:47.531
This picture's great.

27:47.631 --> 27:48.232
Ole Miss.

27:48.272 --> 27:49.714
Nice blush.

27:50.335 --> 27:51.977
Do you have color film in there?

27:51.997 --> 27:57.102
Of course, it's all I do.

27:57.182 --> 28:01.687
I can tell by the way you caressed the camera.

28:04.950 --> 28:07.113
I shot most of the pictures in Gentle Madness.

28:07.273 --> 28:08.654
Oh, really?

28:09.776 --> 28:09.956
Yeah.

28:10.456 --> 28:11.517
Oh, this is great.

28:11.577 --> 28:14.581
This angle here is terrific.

28:14.601 --> 28:15.221
Oh, good.

28:15.341 --> 28:16.763
Gene, can you have something with you?

28:16.783 --> 28:16.883
Sure.

28:17.808 --> 28:18.248
Carol?

28:18.509 --> 28:27.017
You know they say you should never ask the Texas cattleman how many carols he has, how many spears.

28:27.978 --> 28:31.041
You know what I'm getting at?

28:31.061 --> 28:31.261
Oops.

28:31.722 --> 28:32.302
That was good.

28:32.322 --> 28:32.863
I like that.

28:33.423 --> 28:35.225
What, land around it?

28:35.706 --> 28:36.666
Yeah.

28:36.686 --> 28:37.487
Okay.

28:37.507 --> 28:39.349
I like it.

28:39.589 --> 28:40.470
That's good too.

28:40.490 --> 28:41.451
That's what I'll send you.

28:41.471 --> 28:43.393
How about in the other room when we work?

28:44.268 --> 28:45.995
I can tell you're talking.

28:46.075 --> 28:48.203
You're like the maniacs from the next year.

28:48.223 --> 28:49.668
Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.

28:49.688 --> 28:52.499
Well, we have to do a graphic for the sexual hours here.

28:52.700 --> 28:53.282
Four hours.

28:54.275 --> 29:09.618
Oh, yeah.

29:09.638 --> 29:17.329
When they come up and I did an interview with some kinds of kind of writing, some kind of writing, some kind of writing, some kind of writing, some kind of writing, some kind of writing, some kind of writing, some kind of writing, some kind of writing, some kind of writing, some kind of writing, some kind of writing, some kind of writing, some kind of writing, some kind of writing.

29:18.170 --> 29:34.179
You don't spend a minute doing this.

29:34.199 --> 29:36.383
I think it's been a year since four hours, and I think one of the percent of my tickets was 45 seconds or 55.

29:36.403 --> 29:37.224
Do you know what I'm going to figure out?

29:37.244 --> 29:39.047
He doesn't put cash in the kitchen and put it in front of the sun and get 400, 400, 4,000.

29:39.067 --> 29:39.789
I'm not going to be able to do that.

29:39.809 --> 29:40.810
Oh, because it makes it so it's going to be tough.

29:40.830 --> 29:41.071
Yeah, it is.

29:41.091 --> 29:41.191
Yeah.

29:41.211 --> 29:41.532
Where else from?

29:41.552 --> 29:42.253
Bill Stoddard and his own art book.

29:42.892 --> 30:04.777
I love you.

30:04.797 --> 30:05.518
This air is more than 100 years old.

30:05.538 --> 30:05.738
I like it.

30:05.759 --> 30:05.959
I like it.

30:05.979 --> 30:06.179
I like it.

30:06.199 --> 30:06.399
I like it.

30:06.419 --> 30:06.620
I like it.

30:06.640 --> 30:06.840
I like it.

30:06.860 --> 30:07.060
I like it.

30:10.516 --> 30:33.062
I have a problem with him.

30:33.082 --> 30:33.603
The only question is this.

30:33.623 --> 30:34.224
I suppose I was a 50-year-old.

30:34.244 --> 30:34.604
You need the desk.

30:34.624 --> 30:34.784
My desk.

30:34.804 --> 30:35.525
The desk is an hour and a half hour.

30:35.545 --> 30:36.046
I bought a 25-lb surplus.

30:36.066 --> 30:36.386
I had to repent.

30:36.406 --> 30:37.187
Maybe, but it might have been a second.

30:37.207 --> 30:38.008
The drivers go all the way back to here.

30:38.461 --> 31:08.113
They're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than, they're more than

31:09.089 --> 31:31.756
What do we know about the books you're working on?

31:31.776 --> 31:32.357
Do you know what's happening?

31:32.377 --> 31:32.797
Um, the public panel.

31:32.817 --> 31:34.239
Any part of the panel, but, uh, there's not plenty of things like that.

31:34.259 --> 31:35.480
It's full of culture and libraries, which has food libraries.

31:35.500 --> 31:36.061
I really want to check them.

31:36.081 --> 31:36.822
I'm trying to do things that I enjoy.

31:36.842 --> 31:36.902
Um,

31:37.473 --> 31:55.443
You can see the photos, the leopard photo book, and it's a full mask, you know, of leopard times.

31:55.463 --> 31:56.345
Oh, sure, I know the woman who shot the one.

31:56.365 --> 31:56.846
He looked up in Chinese.

31:56.866 --> 31:59.430
In fact, I was going to get some of her pictures in my book, but she wanted $150 a picture, you know, even 50 or 60, 60 seconds.

32:02.802 --> 32:29.882
Speaking very well, this is the take on Gary Wilson in one week.

32:29.902 --> 32:30.463
It's an incredible question.

32:30.483 --> 32:31.524
I think it's all Gary Wilson books as we share them.

32:31.544 --> 32:32.185
You know there's a lot of times.

32:35.540 --> 32:58.325
So we were looking at them, life-wise, and instead of, uh, the motor wheels are a little closer to the moment.

32:58.345 --> 32:58.645
More like this.

32:58.665 --> 32:59.826
I am, uh, next picture of you, but you have a major of it.

32:59.846 --> 33:00.467
That's it, hold on to the left.

33:01.915 --> 33:25.264
The reason I brought up the cattle, you know, I just looked at how many cattle birds, how many birds, how many birds, so I didn't know how to read that.

33:25.284 --> 33:26.886
But I wonder if you have, how many passages of General Netanyahu have been sold?

33:26.906 --> 33:27.627
That's sold in two different states.

33:27.647 --> 33:28.328
We have close to 60,000 in French.

33:28.348 --> 33:28.788
And that's bad for us.

33:28.808 --> 33:29.589
The radio is very excited all the book.

33:29.609 --> 33:29.929
It's incredible.

33:29.950 --> 33:30.370
Yeah, it's wonderful.

33:30.586 --> 33:51.768
My first edition here came to me via William Scheide.

33:51.788 --> 33:52.129
Really?

33:52.489 --> 33:53.971
And this is a long story.

33:54.111 --> 33:55.112
You know Mr. Scheide?

33:55.272 --> 33:56.734
No I do not.

33:56.754 --> 33:58.956
But I do know in my

33:59.982 --> 34:03.366
The man who has kept my feet to the fire is Alexander McLeod.

34:03.406 --> 34:06.690
He's a doctor in Nashville.

34:07.271 --> 34:13.739
And Mr. Scheide is Dr. McLeod's mentor, good friend.

34:14.480 --> 34:21.828
Dr. Alex and Dr. McLeod spend their time at Scheide's home when they're in the area.

34:22.029 --> 34:24.792
He's a Princeton graduate.

34:26.375 --> 34:30.440
This came to me last year for Christmas, and you had signed this.

34:31.402 --> 34:34.205
You had signed one for Alex MacLeod also.

34:34.225 --> 34:34.325
Okay.

34:34.606 --> 34:41.334
You probably, you know, you don't, it wouldn't mean anything to you, but I'm pretty sure that this is, this is how I got this particular copy.

34:41.915 --> 34:51.888
So, and this copy, we were at Henry Holden Company, and Perla, Uriel Kaplan's suite secretary, came out with a couple of these.

34:51.908 --> 34:53.170
Well, good.

34:53.190 --> 34:53.731
The second.

34:54.532 --> 34:55.673
The second is still pretty good.
