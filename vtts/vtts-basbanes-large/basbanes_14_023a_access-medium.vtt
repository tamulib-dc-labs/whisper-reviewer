WEBVTT

00:03.558 --> 00:04.820
A.P.

00:05.140 --> 00:10.187
I want to look at this one here.

00:10.928 --> 00:13.271
Power, yes, power.

00:15.794 --> 00:17.797
I'm not going to have a couple of hours.

00:17.817 --> 00:17.977
Freedom.

00:17.997 --> 00:19.639
Freedom.

00:23.304 --> 00:23.524
Yeah, yeah.

00:24.078 --> 00:48.617
Thank you.

00:48.935 --> 01:15.685
... ... ... ... ...

01:16.053 --> 01:36.812
Thank you.

01:48.065 --> 02:05.550
and to listen to radio, to listen how it's difficult to live here in Sierra Leone, but to understand the situation and to understand the law, you must be here.

02:12.753 --> 02:20.665
I have three sons and one has been killed.

02:20.886 --> 02:22.729
How's it done?

02:22.749 --> 02:33.225
I have one of her sons and the third one is on the front lawn.

02:33.695 --> 02:50.607
We are like, er, like we, like one body who is in Canada.

02:51.633 --> 02:54.282
Some medicine.

02:54.362 --> 02:56.589
Everybody tries to do some medicine.

02:56.609 --> 02:57.291
But we are dying.

02:58.094 --> 03:01.124
They don't found real medicine.

03:01.144 --> 03:03.211
We are dying.

03:03.331 --> 03:04.956
We are dying.

03:04.976 --> 03:05.237
We are dying.

03:10.904 --> 03:29.217
It's not more on the front or at the ground, but it's more in the kitchen.

03:31.525 --> 03:38.294
Okay, we are going to work school.

03:38.775 --> 03:45.744
Now we are in Korea, as we know.

03:45.764 --> 03:51.412
We used to go to school in downtown, but now it's terrible.

03:51.432 --> 03:52.193
No gas shooting all the time.

03:52.213 --> 03:54.997
And we can only go to school one day a week instead of six days a week.

03:55.017 --> 03:59.262
We can come to school or not to come because it's not for that.

03:59.683 --> 04:01.245
We'll make the official office.

04:02.170 --> 04:22.677
We are all...

04:23.095 --> 04:49.963
Wow

05:10.160 --> 05:25.440
This is a very amazing place, you know.

05:25.961 --> 05:29.285
We live for something, for an apartment.

05:30.246 --> 05:38.277
We live in... I don't know, it's not a place, it's actually some kind of

05:39.033 --> 05:46.673
Super modern concentration camps, you know, where people, actually they're living in death.

05:48.839 --> 05:49.280
Understand me?

05:51.125 --> 05:55.135
They're actually not living next to death or really death, but they're living in death.

06:16.681 --> 06:35.787
So this tunnel seems to go to the audience.

06:40.627 --> 06:49.303
Thank you.

07:05.804 --> 07:35.440
Thank you.

07:35.858 --> 08:00.083
So that is the start of Hulik Orchestra.

08:00.103 --> 08:01.644
They play here in the city building, because they cannot play somewhere else.

08:01.664 --> 08:03.486
So they play with one French director, and this is Richard, so it's just to be heroic here.

08:03.837 --> 08:31.262
Can they stop, you know, some of the Serbs who want to create their Green Great Serbia, to occupy the Bouncyon stage and to

08:32.862 --> 08:40.332
to live there and to kill the old people, old people, etc.

08:41.273 --> 08:50.144
The hills are occupied by Chesnicks and we are here in the town, so you can't go out, you can't go anywhere.

08:52.087 --> 09:02.380
Sometimes, sometimes we go to the city, but it's not so, it can be dangerous.

09:02.579 --> 09:10.751
If we, in the city, have played in all of us, then we're going to have to help.

09:10.771 --> 09:12.874
People in the world.

09:12.894 --> 09:15.358
That is just in everyone.

09:15.378 --> 09:20.805
Everything you can treat in the actual world.

09:20.825 --> 09:20.986
But why?

09:21.006 --> 09:23.489
Who can ask only why?

09:24.190 --> 09:27.535
They try to go from the other side, you know.

09:27.675 --> 09:29.498
One of the main issues, you know.

09:29.950 --> 09:52.583
They want to go to the other side, and I know they want to go to the other side, you know, to leave, to leave, you know, but somebody killed them there.

09:59.549 --> 10:08.577
We go to water and anywhere else, just there.

10:08.597 --> 10:08.878
We have to go.

10:08.898 --> 10:10.379
Sniper, we'll be here, but we might.

10:11.060 --> 10:12.621
We'd be delighted if we go to water.

10:12.641 --> 10:18.526
I go, I don't know which water, which water.

10:18.546 --> 10:19.687
To find water.

10:19.707 --> 10:21.549
And I come to traffic very late.

10:21.569 --> 10:24.612
And the traffic is shut.

10:24.632 --> 10:29.016
And when the sniper is shut, I'll check the traffic out back.

10:31.055 --> 10:55.138
This is the car.

10:56.215 --> 11:18.409
These are special bullets for airplanes and they shoot people with it.

11:18.710 --> 11:47.232
When the war finishes,

11:47.633 --> 12:02.431
I think that I will then feel the consequences of this hatred, killing, you know, watching horrible things and listening to horrible things every day.

12:04.313 --> 12:14.986
She came into a refugee center and she saw a woman, a crazy woman, she didn't struggle right herself.

12:15.366 --> 12:16.948
She told her that

12:17.637 --> 12:22.864
No, my mother wasn't like this before the war.

12:22.884 --> 12:44.353
It happened to her when a chestnut came in our house and they took my little sister, she was just a baby, a few months old or something like that, and they put it in a, how do you call it, oven, oven, oven, and they put it in the oven and

12:44.857 --> 13:07.422
turned on and my mother was just standing and baby was crying crying and then she stopped and when they took her out of the oven she looked like a pig and she was all empty or something like that.

13:20.682 --> 13:45.814
Don't move on, don't touch me.

13:45.834 --> 13:46.135
Don't touch me.

13:46.155 --> 13:46.455
Don't touch me.

13:46.475 --> 13:46.775
Don't touch me.

13:46.795 --> 13:47.096
Don't touch me.

13:47.116 --> 13:47.416
Don't touch me.

13:47.436 --> 13:47.737
Don't touch me.

13:47.757 --> 13:48.057
Don't touch me.

13:53.673 --> 14:09.790
.

14:09.810 --> 14:09.830
.

14:09.850 --> 14:09.870
.

14:09.890 --> 14:09.910
.

14:16.150 --> 14:42.343
Thank you.

14:49.732 --> 15:11.018
This is called a special kind of training.

15:12.300 --> 15:18.928
The settings have, you know, and they can speak

15:19.415 --> 15:30.825
Whatever they want to shoot, every object which they see, they can fix with it in choice.

15:43.478 --> 15:46.623
I never need to live.

15:46.643 --> 15:48.706
I'm no need to survive.

15:48.726 --> 15:57.059
And I'm so welcome.

15:58.241 --> 16:00.103
Survive.

16:01.365 --> 16:05.672
I think you, you know, find the damage.

16:06.226 --> 16:12.012
One man is walking down the street and taking a canister of the water.

16:12.032 --> 16:15.035
And in one moment he looks on a floor, cheese.

16:15.616 --> 16:18.659
The type of cheese which we get in the very day.

16:18.799 --> 16:21.722
And he stands and looks at cheese, you know.

16:22.363 --> 16:25.226
And then he tries to take his cheese, but the cheese is moving, you know.

16:25.246 --> 16:26.988
And he's going further for the cheese.

16:27.008 --> 16:30.952
And in one moment he jumps, catches the cheese like that.

16:30.972 --> 16:31.893
Catches the cheese.

16:31.913 --> 16:33.735
And sees through the eyes, just like me, you know.

16:34.019 --> 16:40.129
And they are taking him, taking his blood, you know, because we need every drop of the blood.

16:41.091 --> 16:47.262
And when he is going out, he says, everything is okay to my blindness, he says, but where is my character of the water?

16:47.362 --> 16:49.285
It doesn't need the blood, it doesn't need anything.

16:49.766 --> 16:52.170
There are so many things in Aurora, really.

16:54.334 --> 16:59.723
For example, I think, jump in from San Francisco Bridge.

17:00.631 --> 17:24.867
Oh, there's a lot of big humor in the body.

17:25.235 --> 17:27.458
You know, people just keep on laughing.

17:28.059 --> 17:31.224
And they're making good from horrible things.

17:33.688 --> 17:36.672
That's our mentality, you know.

17:37.213 --> 17:38.975
And it's good.

17:38.995 --> 17:41.960
No matter if it's thick humor.

17:42.621 --> 17:45.385
It isn't humorous.

17:45.405 --> 17:46.787
In about half an hour.

17:47.122 --> 17:50.609
I had to go to the front line because I'm a soldier too.

17:51.751 --> 17:55.679
I spent two days at the front line, and then I had two days off.

17:56.620 --> 17:59.887
I had to play one nightclub, you know.

17:59.907 --> 18:01.570
There are nightclubs in Rio.

18:02.275 --> 18:25.498
Thank you.

18:25.478 --> 18:48.105
I'm his wife.

18:48.125 --> 18:48.565
I, I, I have his wife.

18:48.585 --> 18:49.006
Yes, I have his wife.

18:49.026 --> 18:49.546
Because marriage is a war.

18:49.566 --> 18:49.867
I have a grave.

18:49.887 --> 18:50.187
I have a grave.

18:50.167 --> 19:12.630
You have many, many things to do, you know, many obligations, but you have your family, you have to take care of it, you know, like,

19:13.117 --> 19:36.317
Water, electricity, wood, fire, you know, food.

19:36.337 --> 19:37.158
This is essential for living the rioting.

19:37.178 --> 19:37.439
Water mellow!

19:37.459 --> 19:37.719
Water mellow!

19:37.739 --> 19:38.000
Water mellow!

19:38.020 --> 19:38.280
Water mellow!

19:43.643 --> 20:07.238
Well, the worst thing that happened to me during the war was like two

20:07.623 --> 20:37.343
months ago the killing of three of my friends and while other three were wounded and one other guy and myself were, you know, like left alive, stayed alive when we were at the front line and threatened by the mortar on which I work at the moment and

20:37.812 --> 20:48.027
But two shells, you know, two grenades, two bombs, big, big, huge things fall down.

20:48.227 --> 20:56.560
And people, you spend 10 months, 11 months, I don't know how many.

20:57.982 --> 21:00.425
And you share everything.

21:00.526 --> 21:00.946
I mean, everything.

21:00.966 --> 21:04.511
When you live together, you share everything, you know, like you did.

21:04.531 --> 21:04.872
Everything.

21:05.052 --> 21:06.975
You know, food and cigarettes and everything.

21:07.867 --> 21:15.997
And all of a sudden, in five minutes you lose six people.

21:17.499 --> 21:26.170
And you see it happens four feet or ten feet away from you.

21:26.190 --> 21:36.203
And you have to take care of them, of the wounded people who are dying in front of you, of the thrown heads.

21:36.757 --> 21:50.137
the smell of brain, human brain and blood and mud, and drowning in your hair and everything.

21:50.157 --> 22:03.777
I mean, I hope that no one will have such an experience because it's really, you know, it can get you, make you

22:04.111 --> 22:14.796
Insane.

22:20.328 --> 22:47.305
Every single person is surprised how you're in the church.

22:47.325 --> 22:47.665
Take care of him.

22:47.685 --> 22:48.146
He's always at 20 days.

22:48.166 --> 22:48.507
He was not a kid.

22:48.527 --> 22:48.867
He was not a kid.

22:50.298 --> 22:55.285
There was a contest, only Sarajevo beauty contest.

22:55.305 --> 23:02.455
It was one of the ways to show that to the world and to the enemies.

23:03.436 --> 23:08.804
From what the killer said then, it wasn't.

23:08.824 --> 23:11.327
The Sarajevo contest in 1992.

23:12.539 --> 23:40.934
Each time I may feel you again I fall to pieces How can I be just your friend?

23:40.954 --> 23:41.955
People from my country, from this town,

23:42.340 --> 23:47.951
I guess that they all have their way of fighting.

23:48.151 --> 23:53.061
So not just men with guns, but also women with their beauty.

23:53.081 --> 24:01.437
Pretend we've never met.

24:01.458 --> 24:01.838
And not right away.

24:01.858 --> 24:02.239
I'm not right away.

24:03.215 --> 24:18.351
The buildings are standing behind a sign, drawing flowers, and the sign says, don't let them kill us.

24:18.551 --> 24:27.180
There is no interest to God.

24:27.818 --> 24:41.929
Yeah, it's in Europe, but if they wanted to do something, they do it in the beginning.

24:42.179 --> 25:08.929
Thank you.

25:09.938 --> 25:33.054
Welcome to hell was a sign of graffiti on one of the walls.

25:33.074 --> 25:33.535
Another one driving in.

25:33.555 --> 25:33.956
Welcome to Sarajevo.

25:33.976 --> 25:34.737
There's an image of a dead child, huh?

25:34.757 --> 25:35.558
A smiling child in front of a park park.

25:36.820 --> 25:51.812
Blood on the street collapses.

25:51.832 --> 25:52.433
Blood on the street collapses.

25:52.784 --> 26:13.937
dead and injured on the streets.

26:13.957 --> 26:14.177
Also it is.

26:14.197 --> 26:14.758
This is the burning library.

26:15.194 --> 26:42.650
And in a fresh kit battle, one fight over.

26:42.670 --> 26:42.911
You see her.

26:42.931 --> 26:43.171
You see her.

26:43.191 --> 26:43.431
You see her.

26:43.451 --> 26:43.692
You see her.

26:43.712 --> 26:43.952
You see her.

26:46.970 --> 27:07.619
And they're getting something young, young child.

27:07.639 --> 27:07.999
They're very good.

27:09.633 --> 27:34.761
.

27:34.781 --> 27:34.801
.

27:34.821 --> 27:34.841
.

27:34.861 --> 27:34.881
.

27:36.903 --> 27:46.014
I'm Muslim.

27:46.635 --> 27:48.938
No, I'm Muslim.

27:48.958 --> 27:50.760
But I go sometimes in church.

27:50.780 --> 27:53.063
I go in Muslim.

27:53.243 --> 27:56.967
I believe in God.

27:57.508 --> 28:01.753
Only one God.

28:01.773 --> 28:03.135
Not three guys, four guys.

28:03.155 --> 28:04.296
And I believe in Muslim.

28:04.316 --> 28:05.258
I believe in Muslim.

28:05.278 --> 28:05.678
I believe in Muslim.

28:06.957 --> 28:36.305
God is righteous.

28:36.325 --> 28:36.525
Thank you.

28:37.163 --> 28:44.112
In April of 1992, up to 2,500 shows started falling in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia.

28:45.193 --> 28:51.921
This is dedicated to Corine, C-O-R-R-I-N-A, introduced by Liam Neeson.

28:51.941 --> 29:06.259
These are the credits that are rolling now.

29:13.276 --> 29:17.560
Leah Milley and Kevin was the producer.

29:17.580 --> 29:20.743
Director of I. Bill Carter.

29:20.903 --> 29:22.545
I'm sorry, but I don't have anything.

29:22.965 --> 29:25.147
So are you, 1915, August 1995?

29:25.187 --> 29:25.608
Yes.

29:26.869 --> 29:31.333
Then my life has changed a lot.

29:31.353 --> 29:32.755
But I'm just going to take it out.

29:32.775 --> 29:35.738
A postscript, apparently, to the bill.

29:35.958 --> 29:36.638
Yes.

29:36.779 --> 29:41.443
I have lost

29:41.879 --> 29:48.308
My friend is burnt.

29:48.328 --> 29:48.829
I don't know.

29:50.151 --> 29:52.154
The situation is really heavy.

29:52.174 --> 29:53.656
I can't go walk in the street.

29:54.337 --> 29:55.458
I can't go to school.

29:56.540 --> 29:57.842
I live only for the past.

29:58.102 --> 30:02.428
I tell my friends who live here.

30:02.448 --> 30:05.753
I'm sorry, really sorry that I don't have anything to say.

30:06.774 --> 30:08.717
I'm really quiet.

30:08.737 --> 30:10.760
It's just reality.

30:10.780 --> 30:11.481
Thank you for this.

30:11.967 --> 30:19.846
But since what you have done for us, it's so... I love everyone, really.

30:21.209 --> 30:22.974
Thank you so much.

30:22.994 --> 30:26.382
Bye.

30:35.086 --> 31:00.893
You were surprised how ruthless someone came back.

31:00.913 --> 31:03.456
Unfortunately, there are not so human beings on the dying front, inside your neighbors.

31:04.111 --> 31:09.356
It was not the occupation in the terms of the Second World War.

31:09.376 --> 31:18.626
When you have a possibility to develop this, it is just a very hard attack.

31:19.907 --> 31:29.156
And I think that the surveillance especially did counterattack very slowly, very gently.

31:29.737 --> 31:30.658
And there are specific risks.

31:32.545 --> 31:46.620
It was not organized and presented for the world financially worth it.

31:46.640 --> 32:00.055
It is just one sign that everything is shorted up even in the world, that life go on regardless of the night of the night and night.

32:02.768 --> 32:11.438
Because when I ask you, did you have fun, I didn't want to work here.

32:11.458 --> 32:13.220
I mean, did you live there?

32:14.561 --> 32:19.847
You live there, and you're the person of the experience of employment in the middle of it.

32:19.867 --> 32:21.549
You have to relax and enjoy it.

32:21.569 --> 32:29.738
And then you will understand, because of the general nature of, and of course, when the children have,

32:30.292 --> 32:51.840
But you're asking, I mean, that's just, you know, some other questions.

32:51.860 --> 32:53.141
I think there's a film there that don't worry about the answers.

32:53.161 --> 32:53.582
You know what I mean?

32:53.765 --> 33:15.275
What happened then?

33:15.295 --> 33:15.556
I don't know.

33:15.576 --> 33:16.116
It was probably real close.

33:16.137 --> 33:16.938
But I had the money to worry about that.

33:16.958 --> 33:17.518
Just trying, trying, trying.

33:17.538 --> 33:18.219
You know, you run into this chair.

33:18.239 --> 33:19.041
Because I ran into people on their side.

33:19.061 --> 33:19.581
And here's the assumption.

33:19.601 --> 33:20.643
I never really don't want to screw in with that one.

33:20.663 --> 33:21.905
I'm standing there and that guy's telling me about 15 minutes.

33:21.925 --> 33:22.185
I don't know.

33:22.908 --> 33:34.919
And that the battle happened to go through.

33:34.939 --> 33:39.564
So it was very much like, it was very much in their entire operation for a few years.

33:39.584 --> 33:39.904
Three years ago.

33:39.924 --> 33:43.367
And you think, all right, all right, you're 10 years old.

33:43.387 --> 33:46.350
If you do come back, you got something on your own.

33:47.211 --> 33:47.872
And you tell me about this thing.

33:47.892 --> 33:48.572
And you're about to go kill a kid.

33:48.673 --> 33:49.293
Help me.

33:49.413 --> 33:49.613
You can't.

33:49.633 --> 33:51.295
You know, a normal Indian comes in there and fights with a lot.

33:51.916 --> 34:16.749
You know, what you could do on that, if you take that exact same thing according to our country, you're not going to even come here and kill us.

34:16.769 --> 34:17.951
But if I tell you, no, we have to tell you about the truth.

34:17.971 --> 34:18.912
The truth is today, and this is what I'm doing.

34:18.932 --> 34:20.153
Right, and there's a really strange, like, feeling like this.

34:20.174 --> 34:21.015
I'm not sure the same people are visiting.

34:21.035 --> 34:21.215
Oh, yeah.

34:21.235 --> 34:21.315
Wow.

34:22.595 --> 34:36.933
Well, I just had a question on how exactly you got into Parallel Europe, I mean, in the midst of this war.

34:38.495 --> 34:46.645
I look from a conflict in Croatia, nine days ago, it was about 200 kilometers.

34:47.080 --> 34:58.689
Nine days after .

34:58.709 --> 35:01.275
And at the time he cried, it was quite easy to go.

35:05.288 --> 35:21.785
They were much worse in many ways than the market curves.

35:21.805 --> 35:26.770
Much more loose about how they take care of it on the road.

35:26.790 --> 35:27.130
It was not loose.

35:27.150 --> 35:27.951
It was ridiculous in the yard, actually.

35:27.971 --> 35:30.253
If I think that, I've done the same thing easily, and I've forgotten that some things would happen on the trail.

35:30.273 --> 35:32.575
But some things you don't remember.

35:32.596 --> 35:32.936
Did you go alone?

35:32.956 --> 35:33.516
I went along, yeah.

35:33.536 --> 35:34.097
But I met some amazing guys.

35:35.039 --> 35:48.919
You know, I mean, just to paint a picture, these guys were, these guys were, the reason we were, they were accepted in five tons, so they were like that.

35:48.939 --> 35:53.245
The reason we were, we had, um, five, five-ton trucks, all things like Art Clemson and Robby, you know, cartoons.

35:54.027 --> 35:56.891
Massive cartoons.

35:56.911 --> 36:01.958
And everybody had, everybody was a little bit of a hated hippie, but

36:02.377 --> 36:06.326
They were all rapers.

36:07.448 --> 36:13.982
And we brought in, like, food and medicine and a bunch of toys.

36:15.245 --> 36:18.112
And we had circus kind of skid up.

36:18.132 --> 36:21.158
You know, we'd clowns in an outfit.

36:21.178 --> 36:22.461
And that's what we drove across Vermont.

36:29.191 --> 36:34.596
The UN had all kinds of rules.

36:36.378 --> 36:49.611
Like for a while they wouldn't let morphine go to the ringers, the hospital, and the affection of Syria on several of the funds.

36:49.631 --> 36:57.139
It would have taken morphine out of there.

36:58.216 --> 37:11.373
I went along, but then I came to this group in the next state of London.

37:11.393 --> 37:11.773
I think it's tired.

37:11.793 --> 37:17.160
There's two big towers every single day, and two cheese towers.

37:17.180 --> 37:19.183
We'll live on the 8th floor.

37:19.323 --> 37:23.628
And, you know, I had a power station for about 8 months.

37:23.648 --> 37:24.049
I got 8 hours a day.

37:24.069 --> 37:24.550
It's been 8 hours a day.

37:24.570 --> 37:25.391
That's after that.

37:25.411 --> 37:26.132
Two hours a day to sleep after that.

37:26.152 --> 37:28.054
You know, this is the old story.

37:31.527 --> 37:38.315
You're in trucks with these trucks too?

37:38.956 --> 37:40.678
Yeah, I don't know.

37:41.199 --> 37:43.401
Nothing is long.

37:43.421 --> 37:46.826
What's an off-school weather that took nine days to get trucks?

37:46.846 --> 37:50.951
Months, months, chances.

37:51.411 --> 37:53.393
There's everyone up there.

37:53.414 --> 37:58.800
Roblox, they're a curl up, maybe an HBO guy, you just want to send them a car every day.

37:59.742 --> 38:21.257
And, you know, the stretch of land at that time was all, hey, Josh, you know, you got to kind of gear up for it.

38:21.277 --> 38:21.598
We had no money.

38:21.618 --> 38:26.205
And so, hey, you can kind of compare.

38:26.573 --> 38:29.960
Then we went back and forth a lot.

38:29.980 --> 38:33.306
We had another truck in Johnson, Kitsiak, and we would get back the stuff and take it in three.

38:33.326 --> 38:40.360
We had a lot of doctors.

38:40.380 --> 38:40.701
One, two, three.

38:44.883 --> 39:04.815
yeah well i'm going to

39:04.795 --> 39:29.283
You know, he's from the city.

39:29.303 --> 39:30.584
He's got, I'm sure, a whole pile of watching spots on his brain.

39:30.604 --> 39:31.385
Actually, I wasn't playing for a while.

39:31.405 --> 39:31.846
Probably about a year.

39:31.866 --> 39:33.147
I mean, I wasn't, like, dangerous, but I was definitely playing.

39:33.167 --> 39:33.908
So, a little poisoning, a little, uh,

39:34.175 --> 39:40.467
A lot of new stories take everybody up the ground to correct it.

39:41.749 --> 39:51.247
Because, you know, normally you're kind of going, oh, man, there's another story that's actually going, you know, he's got a story that is on the back.

39:51.267 --> 39:52.289
And you kind of go, all right, that's out the door.

39:52.309 --> 39:53.010
There's another one.

39:55.403 --> 40:04.351
The big problem for me is coming here.

40:04.371 --> 40:07.634
America is not the place to come out of Cerebro.

40:07.654 --> 40:11.718
This place is actually going to say, you come out of Cerebro, I'll find a Cerebro.

40:11.738 --> 40:17.843
Because once you leave Cerebro, you see, there's a thing that happens after a certain point in time in Cerebro.

40:17.863 --> 40:19.445
And I don't know if Cerebro's got the same click mentality.

40:19.465 --> 40:22.668
You have to be, like me and I, X amount of foreigners in the room.

40:22.688 --> 40:23.048
You're in Cerebro.

40:24.142 --> 40:26.765
And you look kind of like, I know I'm American.

40:26.785 --> 40:27.867
I know that I can always believe.

40:27.887 --> 40:29.709
I know that I'm a student.

40:29.729 --> 40:36.277
But once you start really getting involved, I mean, food, water, the whole way you live your life, you start to look out at the world.

40:36.358 --> 40:37.739
You know you're all watching on CNN.

40:39.522 --> 40:42.786
As a matter of fact, we're watching on CNN.

40:43.246 --> 40:43.627
Why?

40:43.647 --> 40:44.888
It's quite silly.

40:45.589 --> 40:46.911
And you start to think, we're on CNN.

40:46.931 --> 40:51.617
Actually, the entire world is saying,

40:52.323 --> 41:11.683
And I'm not in banking, because him and I, we look at each other and honestly say, you know, change through.

41:11.703 --> 41:12.624
And this isn't happening to me.

41:12.644 --> 41:15.106
And she felt things like the world was really scary.

41:15.126 --> 41:15.867
I think the world was really off cue.

41:15.887 --> 41:16.288
That's what happens.

41:16.308 --> 41:17.189
That starts when everybody's not in banking.

41:17.209 --> 41:17.429
She's busy.

41:17.449 --> 41:18.430
You know, normal banking, you keep busy about it.

41:18.450 --> 41:18.550
Yeah.

41:18.968 --> 41:29.584
I think it's like really easy for all of us kids in America to be in denial about the things going on in the world, you know?

41:29.604 --> 41:35.252
And you're watching your documentary and then you think about people in the media place, I mean, you don't see this.

41:35.272 --> 41:36.894
No, no.

41:36.914 --> 41:37.235
What do you see?

41:37.255 --> 41:39.118
What you see though, you see more of this life.

41:39.138 --> 41:41.281
Because this life is a real fun entertainment.

41:41.301 --> 41:46.849
If they're done in 30 seconds with like a dramatic voice saying, you know, James, you're evil.

41:47.470 --> 41:57.886
How do you feel about the media?

41:57.986 --> 42:14.170
Do you look to film as more representing the industry?

42:14.285 --> 42:21.513
Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, art, you know, film, it's, and that's what I'm into, that I think it's a good thing.

42:21.533 --> 42:29.141
When I was in Caryville, I had a very, very tight relationship.

42:29.161 --> 42:32.184
First of all, I didn't meet a journalist for like a full month.

42:32.204 --> 42:34.166
Then I realized they were right across the street and all the animals.

42:34.347 --> 42:42.675
And when I went in there, I had this huge banquet room of wine and food and satellite phones for 25 bucks a minute and baths.

42:43.136 --> 42:44.157
I was just about...

42:45.267 --> 42:51.893
I was freaked out.

42:51.993 --> 42:55.617
Not to blame the individual journalist.

42:55.637 --> 42:57.138
He's just doing his job.

42:57.559 --> 42:59.601
That's not what we talked about, David.

42:59.621 --> 43:01.663
I started to realize I don't get it.

43:01.683 --> 43:05.046
But look, I'm not saying that in general.

43:05.066 --> 43:10.631
There's some journalists that got very well and they really worked hard and, you know, some ladies and gentlemen that made the stuff, but it's a small percentage.

43:11.772 --> 43:12.172
I had a problem.

43:12.193 --> 43:12.793
We had a couple of times.

43:12.813 --> 43:14.575
Did you have to send a car to your audience when you made this?

43:14.615 --> 43:14.835
No, no, no.

43:15.743 --> 43:18.186
What were you trying to achieve at a particular point?

43:18.727 --> 43:28.859
Well, actually, you know, we knew it was... I was scheduled to do a live link to Sarah Evel and to, like, all of Europe, one TV studio.

43:28.879 --> 43:44.198
So we went to live to Russia, Serbia, Croatia, Turkey, with the movie, and also Vlado, the guy that brings that up, and the two sisters, and it's quite fun.

43:44.650 --> 44:06.441
And so we didn't know when they go on the TV very well.

44:06.461 --> 44:07.002
So... Did you go to Russia?

44:07.022 --> 44:07.142
I did.

44:07.162 --> 44:07.403
I filmed it.

44:07.423 --> 44:08.665
Actually, I went to the 50th anniversary of the TV library.

44:08.685 --> 44:09.566
I knew Russia was quite during the siege.

44:09.586 --> 44:11.509
And I could hardly find the Russians to be able to do something about the siege.

44:11.529 --> 44:12.050
It was really interesting.

44:12.070 --> 44:13.071
On the third anniversary, I showed this film.

44:13.726 --> 44:25.414
And young people were very, very, very, very, very hard talented.

44:27.459 --> 44:30.587
And they had young male friends who were like, you're a liar, crap.

44:31.158 --> 44:47.398
And it was really weird, right?

44:47.418 --> 44:48.340
One of the very, I'll tell you what, it's not.

44:54.968 --> 45:20.563
Yeah.

45:20.583 --> 45:20.783
Thank you.

45:20.803 --> 45:21.304
This question is for you.

45:21.324 --> 45:22.065
You talked about coming from America.

45:22.085 --> 45:22.586
How did you find America?

45:22.606 --> 45:23.087
Is this your first time?

45:23.107 --> 45:23.187
Yes.

45:23.207 --> 45:23.487
And I used it.

45:23.507 --> 45:23.707
I used it.

45:23.727 --> 45:23.928
I used it.

45:23.948 --> 45:24.148
I used it.

45:25.495 --> 45:51.753
Yes, there is a big difference.

45:51.773 --> 45:53.275
I'm just saying, if someone is like the old friend, you have to come to me.

45:53.828 --> 46:19.970
Because the Americans are also put free, there is an invisible link between the mentality of the Bosnians and the U.S.

46:19.990 --> 46:21.371
I mean, if you can just give it to you, John, you can't even hear it.

46:21.391 --> 46:23.133
And at the last of weeks, where you come here, I understand that he's totally obsessed.

46:23.153 --> 46:23.633
And he's a free Bosnian.

46:24.473 --> 46:46.909
He made his employer and all of those he's been writing about back to the years ago from working on.

46:46.929 --> 46:48.051
Each of that kind of a story took to a previous meeting.

46:48.071 --> 46:51.797
Now the point about the future, regardless of what will happen to this day, whether it be the European type of the city of all, simply the human creation of the Islamic type of the city,

46:52.216 --> 47:01.946
It will be the most interested people in the whole Europe.

47:02.626 --> 47:09.673
Because it must have some kind of a development.

47:11.495 --> 47:13.017
We have everybody in the community.

47:13.037 --> 47:14.898
The most expensive at the moment.

47:14.918 --> 47:21.565
Consultancy, European Commission, Cultural Europe, Inesco, UNESCO, FBI, CIA, American Airlines, Moscow.

47:23.131 --> 47:50.378
World Bank, International Monetary Fund, the representatives of all the nations, East and West, everything.

47:50.398 --> 47:52.800
It would be very interesting to see how it felt to be developed, how it felt to develop this idea, and how the political

47:54.890 --> 48:21.240
This is the fact that we are almost evident in the fact that we develop a new cycle.

48:21.260 --> 48:23.142
You know, Europe is very, very good considering the possibility of our success in the country.

48:23.915 --> 48:47.495
The second item, which I'd like to come to with, is the future of the forest.

48:47.515 --> 48:48.476
They have a lot of ruins in which you can build.

48:48.496 --> 48:49.417
Buildings, construction, and things like that.

48:49.437 --> 48:51.218
The way the money is coming right now, from investments, buildings, buildings, buildings.

48:51.238 --> 48:52.619
Most of these buildings will remain in ruins for next 10 or 30 years.

48:52.639 --> 48:53.500
So that's a little bit over the way around.

48:54.188 --> 49:21.203
Definitely, there will be some other buildings, some other idea, and some other models, which will also fit with the landscape of cars.

49:21.223 --> 49:23.065
If you can recall, this is the right speed of the normal car running to plan for everything.

49:24.057 --> 49:52.697
Now we have to fight the struggle, which is more or less personal, but the struggle is a little bigger in our lives.

49:54.280 --> 50:04.170
They teach us how to live, rather than us teaching them.

50:04.190 --> 50:08.594
I think that we are building a downfall.

50:09.835 --> 50:22.287
Maybe, if you teach us in Rome, maybe, never be able to also be able to exchange this information.

50:22.307 --> 50:24.169
And one final remark to the media.

50:25.297 --> 50:28.902
Everyone was there on the side.

50:28.922 --> 50:51.834
Most of the press was there on the side, but I would like to thank each and every journalist on this oath of not abandoning us, of being together with us, and reporting from the spot the bloody people of Sarajevo or whatever other issue.

50:51.854 --> 50:55.118
That was our only link to the international community.

50:55.773 --> 51:14.583
Because we can experience seven days without any international organization, even Red Cross, abandoning the system.

51:14.603 --> 51:17.768
During the night, we've been watching this year's car, full of stars.

51:17.788 --> 51:20.953
Of course, there is not a physical outlet for the TV.

51:21.760 --> 51:42.803
And suddenly, all the city realized that there is nothing wrong on regular basis.

51:42.823 --> 51:45.326
We don't know what it is, because we didn't have the time.

51:45.346 --> 51:46.227
We didn't have to find any opinion about it.

51:46.247 --> 51:46.768
We didn't watch the story.

51:46.788 --> 51:48.349
And then the rumor spread around the city.

51:48.369 --> 51:49.851
And everyone is speaking this story, this particular story.

51:49.871 --> 51:51.733
Yes, there is some kind of a very special stuff like this human and the situation over there.

51:52.928 --> 52:07.091
That was our only hope for the seven days without any military or civilian observer, without any reporter here in court who will mobilize the international community to act.

52:09.054 --> 52:15.805
By waiting the intervention, the city itself organized on a very particular way.

52:16.586 --> 52:17.788
You have to fight for your freedom.

52:19.017 --> 52:25.162
Because going to the border, and you're done in 32 hours a year time.

52:25.723 --> 52:27.704
Okay, you have all the time on the earth.

52:27.844 --> 52:36.552
But, if you want anything extra, at least inshallah, you have to fight for it.

52:37.372 --> 52:39.594
Go twice and lose another two or maybe three hours.

52:40.775 --> 52:43.758
Very risky joke.

52:43.778 --> 52:45.299
But everyone did it.

52:45.319 --> 52:48.822
Because there is no one who will do this

52:49.763 --> 52:57.178
It's for you.

52:57.198 --> 53:02.649
You cannot pay you.

53:02.669 --> 53:03.590
That is the point that we met.

53:03.610 --> 53:04.552
What was the difference?

53:04.572 --> 53:06.456
I stay here, I behave like normal, but Yamanan is a lot.

53:07.195 --> 53:34.345
David Anderson, a famous Swedish actor who has tried to find several opinions and have established a group called Oki Sarajevo supporting the national theater in which he was looking at the national theater to the players, to the small institutions, make-up, figure it, money industry.

53:34.365 --> 53:35.346
She was so obsessed with Sarajevo that

53:35.680 --> 53:39.566
She got a medical treatment done after taking treatment.

53:40.387 --> 53:40.928
You know why?

53:41.468 --> 53:44.713
She starts asking herself, do I really need my brain over?

53:47.297 --> 53:53.566
Do I really need three or four television sets spread around my luxury house?

53:53.586 --> 54:00.657
Do I need five sets of different sports, sports, or things?

54:01.257 --> 54:05.063
Do I really need five different jackets or clothes?

54:06.325 --> 54:11.293
or perfume or whatever.

54:12.315 --> 54:22.933
Obsessed with that, she starts talking with her friends and leads to some kind of very special group.

54:23.834 --> 54:28.782
She sells her property in a way to raise her money.

54:28.802 --> 54:32.248
But it is a normal human question when you compare nothing

54:33.089 --> 54:40.159
to what is quite normal.

54:41.621 --> 54:43.003
What is the material?

54:43.824 --> 54:45.045
What is useful?

54:47.309 --> 54:50.573
What is it going to be?

54:50.733 --> 54:53.918
What is life all about?

54:54.278 --> 54:58.183
And where is the... What is the minimum standard?

54:58.204 --> 54:58.704
Where is the human being?

54:58.724 --> 54:59.265
Where are the human beings?

54:59.285 --> 54:59.886
It starts and when it starts.

54:59.906 --> 55:00.767
That's the whole issue

55:01.304 --> 55:17.429
Because you have to ask these questions on and on again.

55:17.449 --> 55:22.417
I think this is a magnificent view of this movie, because there is no line there.

55:22.437 --> 55:24.821
He was scared for going into the building and shooting Charlie.

55:26.123 --> 55:29.488
This building was close, more than 50 meters from the river of Sarajevo, out by Sirs.

55:31.038 --> 55:54.092
Everything that happened in Sarajevo happened in the 9th or 11th.

55:54.112 --> 55:54.493
It became a symbol.

55:54.513 --> 55:54.953
Holiday in the office.

55:54.974 --> 55:56.596
The office is the church, and that is where generally can they plant their homes?

55:56.616 --> 55:58.699
Faith, you know, to themselves, you know, to sell their apartments, simply waiting for them to continue.

55:59.168 --> 56:21.837
We, the nomadists in the world, believe us some kind of a distance.

56:21.857 --> 56:23.258
I see in the day, and thanks to God, each time, it's alive next to me.

56:23.278 --> 56:24.940
This is a certain kind of a mythical mythology that we develop in order to survive.

56:24.960 --> 56:26.222
And that is why it's so important to see, or not to mix things.

56:26.894 --> 56:48.304
Let's forget about it, Paul.

56:48.324 --> 56:50.046
Let's talk about reality and how people, yes, and how they reflect the nature of them.

56:50.066 --> 56:51.729
There is only the literature of heaven, and there is only something on the horizon.

56:51.749 --> 56:53.050
These others of your Christian mystically are about the universe.

56:53.070 --> 56:53.771
And by the way, who would end that?

56:53.791 --> 56:54.252
Can I ask you about it?

56:54.721 --> 57:22.905
so we inject politics um the date of these talks exists that these two segments of the boss i have a strong suspicion that that in fact will not work yes does that matter to you all of these blends also by international

57:23.476 --> 57:40.715
You know, one of the Jews who stopped the war, you know, one like that, through the villages.

57:40.735 --> 57:49.585
They've been, of course, tragically, unfortunately, tragically devised their country to a secular state, which I think that the Jewish government does not have the attributes of the state.

57:50.763 --> 58:02.317
But I, as a citizen of a university, do not have the right to go in the future.

58:02.337 --> 58:05.821
Just have a practical university, a divided.

58:05.841 --> 58:17.515
But it is the first piece of paper which has an implementation process involved in the paper.

58:17.535 --> 58:19.437
So, I have to follow

58:19.653 --> 58:28.407
Because it gives me the chance of hoping that there will be a second, third, or fourth generation of this.

58:28.427 --> 58:31.051
Generation of this.

58:31.071 --> 58:33.815
That will bring the pieces of the country together.

58:34.897 --> 58:40.326
Maps that you are seeing now are totally ridiculous.

58:41.527 --> 58:45.694
But they are produced in such a way that if anything is going wrong,

58:46.754 --> 59:08.233
So, of course, Konigod, a little tiny spot on the north, can be easily touched.

59:08.253 --> 59:13.558
And the pressure that the international community is putting upon the Bosnians is something... We are in the learning process.

59:13.578 --> 59:15.900
There must be a pressure, and there will be a pressure all the time.

59:16.707 --> 59:24.717
are capable not to raise another second generation of our politicians to obtain more projects.

59:24.737 --> 59:29.964
There is no way that you can put Bosnia in two and three projects.

59:30.064 --> 59:31.226
You know why?

59:33.168 --> 59:38.535
Because the border of Bosnia goes directly to me and my wife back.

59:38.555 --> 59:39.096
And I won't.

59:39.376 --> 59:43.922
So that's mostly for credit.

59:43.942 --> 59:44.723
Only other divisions.

59:45.597 --> 01:00:11.554
are so rude, so complicated, and so unjust, that create not one ghetto, one hundred thousand of the world, in a country which is structured in great, with a common population living as a refugee, outside, believe it or not, that these are the first of the UNHCR,

01:00:12.867 --> 01:00:36.679
If Bosnia is in this moment in 135 countries all over the world.

01:00:36.699 --> 01:00:39.463
Of course, there are little pieces of Bosnia in their heart, returning to the process that is broken with the non-government and election.

01:00:39.483 --> 01:00:40.444
But you have a waste plan, you have a minefield,

01:00:41.369 --> 01:00:42.771
You never talk only about places.

01:00:44.052 --> 01:00:54.365
You have to do something to improve the structure, to give them a chance and hope to not to live together, together, to live.

01:00:54.385 --> 01:01:01.694
As soon as you let people live, they will find a way how to communicate.

01:01:01.794 --> 01:01:08.022
They will communicate well by smuggling cigarettes and then the economy will do that.

01:01:08.042 --> 01:01:08.743
I feel very much like

01:01:09.112 --> 01:01:30.396
And we were talking about this kind of what we were doing on this area.

01:01:30.416 --> 01:01:32.077
And we were talking about eight men and it was going to be open and all this stuff.

01:01:32.097 --> 01:01:32.578
It's just a little crap.

01:01:32.598 --> 01:01:34.060
What's going to happen if we'll be able to come up against the terrorist?

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:35.021
Some people are going to know she was a former.

01:01:35.041 --> 01:01:36.182
Some people are going to know she's no lady in the chair.

01:01:36.854 --> 01:01:53.938
I don't believe she used to know that Muslims were there.

01:01:53.958 --> 01:01:54.199
Keep coming.

01:01:54.219 --> 01:01:54.459
Keep coming.

01:01:54.479 --> 01:01:54.719
Keep coming.

01:01:54.739 --> 01:01:55.661
There's no reason to bother to sound terrible.

01:01:55.681 --> 01:01:56.662
You know, she's a sound terrible.

01:01:56.682 --> 01:01:58.144
That's how it's done.

01:01:58.164 --> 01:02:02.330
Not by, you know, I mean, I think it's right to think of the future, but not by you and now hanging out together.

01:02:02.350 --> 01:02:03.492
It's going to be a very slow getting together process.

01:02:03.512 --> 01:02:03.792
Yeah, I guess.

01:02:03.812 --> 01:02:04.313
Those are new economists.

01:02:04.681 --> 01:02:15.914
What I worry about is that library was deliberately targeted by people who were presumably filing an mortgage or not in college education.

01:02:16.135 --> 01:02:20.560
They didn't know that that was why the library was doing.

01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:20.840
No, no.

01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:24.064
But somebody knew that library.

01:02:24.204 --> 01:02:25.786
Exactly, yes, precisely.

01:02:25.806 --> 01:02:26.968
That's what I worry about.

01:02:27.228 --> 01:02:29.751
It's the university professors who are running these things.

01:02:29.771 --> 01:02:32.815
They're not always with a carrot.

01:02:32.835 --> 01:02:33.996
Yeah, unfortunately.

01:02:34.364 --> 01:02:39.852
The major architects of the intellectual store, and more of us, and the intellectual store
