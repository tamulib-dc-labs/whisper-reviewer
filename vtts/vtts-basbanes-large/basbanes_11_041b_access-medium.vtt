00:02.427 --> 00:10.978
My reading list at Amherst, because this has to do with a lot of the recent anthologies.

00:11.719 --> 00:12.981
So the young man stood up.

00:13.562 --> 00:29.903
So the young man stood up after this young man had given this brilliant straight-out-of-the-book thing about the pathology, you know, of these Latinos and black people and how there was no real

00:30.372 --> 00:34.837
organization, you know, that they didn't have that.

00:34.957 --> 00:39.342
And so he gets up, one of them gets up and talks about the black church.

00:41.425 --> 00:42.926
It's a wonderful example.

00:42.986 --> 00:59.485
And he talks about it in relationship to what had happened in the civil rights time and so forth and so on.

00:59.819 --> 01:13.395
Well, I'm not going to continue, but I decided, yes, I would like to come, and I thought it would be very interesting also to talk in an all-male college, but I wanted to go because it was Emily Dickinson's Amherst.

01:13.415 --> 01:14.917
That's her hometown.

01:14.937 --> 01:15.918
Right down the street.

01:15.939 --> 01:17.340
Right down the street.

01:17.921 --> 01:19.303
Right down the street.

01:20.324 --> 01:27.092
And I'd already been there twice with Theodore Ward, who I'd mentioned earlier.

01:27.376 --> 01:34.027
who had carte blanche at the house next door in the Emily Dickinson house, too, because of who she was.

01:35.509 --> 01:41.879
But so I had my first academic experience.

01:42.500 --> 01:43.963
Well, this was 69, 70.

01:44.984 --> 01:53.518
There was a lot of, in my, I had four young men from SDS, Students for a Democratic Society.

01:53.853 --> 02:07.333
They were very excited about my class, because it had this fascinating name, which I had not given it, but Leo Marx, who taught there and was kind of the guy who'd been most instrumental in inviting me as the writer.

02:07.353 --> 02:14.845
And I'd said I would come if I could teach another class, and it would be a class in literature.

02:15.706 --> 02:19.692
And I was called suddenly to give a title.

02:19.925 --> 02:25.531
I couldn't think of a title, so Leo said, well, describe it, what you're going to teach.

02:25.631 --> 02:33.179
So I said, well, it's going to be literature about poverty.

02:37.724 --> 02:41.208
Well, it's going to be literature about the human struggle for freedom.

02:42.209 --> 02:46.253
Well, anyhow...

02:47.245 --> 03:00.687
As this was a time of when with so many of the college kids, unlike so many of the working class kids, they were not going to be going anyway.

03:00.707 --> 03:02.771
They were very much against the war.

03:02.811 --> 03:12.527
It was when poor David Eisenhower was there and Julie Nixon, and over the frat house,

03:13.520 --> 03:24.413
appeared this huge—the front house where he was, it was right on the corner across from the campus, impeach Nixon must have been hell for those two young people.

03:24.453 --> 03:27.397
I really felt for them then, you know.

03:27.417 --> 03:28.719
I've met him.

03:28.739 --> 03:29.239
I did interview with him.

03:29.259 --> 03:31.282
Well, I never had anything.

03:31.302 --> 03:39.612
I mean, he didn't enroll in my class, and she didn't come over from—or Smith, I guess she was Smith.

03:39.980 --> 03:41.602
I think it was Smith.

03:41.622 --> 03:44.045
It doesn't sound quite right to me, but anyhow.

03:45.347 --> 03:49.412
She wouldn't, she doesn't seem like a Smith girl, actually, does she?

03:49.432 --> 03:51.054
No, no, she doesn't.

03:51.114 --> 03:53.096
I don't think it was Smith.

03:53.136 --> 03:53.637
Vassar.

03:53.717 --> 03:55.159
Vassar sounds more like it.

03:55.299 --> 03:56.581
No, Vassar isn't there.

03:56.701 --> 03:58.523
Vassar is upstate New York.

03:59.224 --> 03:59.444
Well.

04:00.045 --> 04:00.285
No.

04:00.586 --> 04:02.248
Anyhow, well, it'll come to us soon.

04:02.268 --> 04:03.369
Mount Holyoke, perhaps?

04:03.389 --> 04:04.911
Mount Holyoke, perhaps.

04:05.031 --> 04:06.493
Mount Holyoke, Smith.

04:06.878 --> 04:10.503
And there was one other women's college there.

04:10.723 --> 04:12.485
Well, Wellesley is the other way.

04:12.725 --> 04:13.206
Oh, yes.

04:13.526 --> 04:13.947
Oh, yes.

04:14.408 --> 04:14.548
Uh-huh.

04:14.568 --> 04:16.831
Well, I don't think they would have sent her to Wellesley.

04:16.871 --> 04:18.132
That would have been a little too.

04:18.172 --> 04:19.314
Well, that's right.

04:19.374 --> 04:23.359
And the wrong surroundings.

04:24.841 --> 04:36.075
Well, I decided that the first part of my class was going to be around war.

04:36.646 --> 05:00.392
And I taught, for instance, Nicholas Stick, which is this wonderful—the young—he was middle-aged then—Tolstoy, who'd served in that terrible czarist army, but as an officer, you know, had encountered this man who was a hundred years old and had—

05:00.575 --> 05:20.700
survived not only a war, I think, was it against Turkey, whatever Turkey was called then or something, but anyhow, but at the time, well, at the time when one out of every four would be beaten to death in the gauntlet that they had.

05:20.720 --> 05:28.810
It was a time of terrible cruelty, and so he wrote about that.

05:28.992 --> 05:40.464
Then I had three other things that I was also teaching that had never been taught before at Amherst.

05:40.524 --> 05:49.714
And I think the only thing I taught all that semester, because I also wanted to teach—oh, I had work in my title, too.

05:49.774 --> 05:53.157
And, of course, Germinal, I guess they were teaching.

05:53.217 --> 05:57.582
They would teach that from time to time, but it also gave me a chance to.

05:58.102 --> 06:18.985
To contrast being female and male, which was something else I was about in that class, and that is when the daughter, who also works in the mines, has to get up like her mother earlier than the guys, and in addition to not getting a chance to sit down and eat anything, has to pack the lunches as well.

06:19.406 --> 06:24.231
You know, it's just one of those kinds of things.

06:24.251 --> 06:27.535
But I won't go on about the class, but it was quite a reading list.

06:28.088 --> 06:35.878
And as I said, it was not the kind of thing that was being taught.

06:36.819 --> 06:42.226
And I don't want to get started talking.

06:42.266 --> 06:46.211
It was pretty courageous of Amherst to invite you to do this class.

06:46.231 --> 06:50.276
They never expected me that I was going to teach a class like that.

06:50.496 --> 06:52.999
I was going to be freaky.

06:53.603 --> 07:10.950
They expected me to throw great parties like the other writers in residence did, have an affair or two that they could gossip about, you know, that would add a little spice to it all because this was the usual record I gathered as I learned.

07:11.511 --> 07:17.780
And instead, because it was that year, not only was I a female, I was getting up at faculty meetings.

07:17.800 --> 07:20.725
I was going to faculty meetings and I was speaking.

07:21.177 --> 07:30.691
about what was going on, and when they wanted to expel the black students who took over the library, I got up and I spoke about it.

07:31.673 --> 07:45.133
And anyhow, I wasn't trying to be outrageous or anything, but I just had not been briefed about how you were supposed to behave, and it was also a very special year.

07:45.794 --> 07:50.661
Anyhow, I began to be asked for my reading list.

07:51.535 --> 07:57.503
And also what I hadn't taught that I had put as if they wanted to do more reading.

07:57.804 --> 08:01.368
By the way, I did teach Agnes Smedley's Daughter of Earth.

08:01.449 --> 08:03.912
Do you have that reading list still?

08:04.032 --> 08:04.252
What?

08:04.393 --> 08:05.454
Oh, yes.

08:05.474 --> 08:05.855
Oh, yes.

08:05.955 --> 08:07.497
And I'll send you a copy.

08:07.677 --> 08:07.977
Yes.

08:08.037 --> 08:08.498
You'll remember?

08:08.518 --> 08:08.959
Yes.

08:08.979 --> 08:09.540
Yes.

08:09.560 --> 08:10.701
Uh-huh.

08:10.721 --> 08:19.433
And anyhow, Paul Lauder, who at that time was with Florence Howe,

08:20.054 --> 08:41.359
As more and more, I mean, 1971, when I spoke the second talk in silence as women who were writers in our century, I was asked for a reading list, because all these, I said, the academics, they'd had good teaching, but they didn't know this other literature.

08:42.340 --> 08:48.728
And I taught wonderful, by the way, speaking of writers who were educated in the library,

08:49.248 --> 08:51.872
There was wonderful Carlos Bulacan.

08:51.912 --> 09:14.648
I just mentioned something about the Philippines that I read in our library here, where I ran across El Ultima Adios, which was Jose Rizal's valedictory that is quoted in, Hey, Sailor, What Ship?

09:15.725 --> 09:22.757
Although I heard that also from a Filipino seaman, but he didn't know it all by heart.

09:22.817 --> 09:36.800
And then I looked it up in the library in a ragged book that was unquestionably destroyed because it wasn't there in this sudden period when I first heard that they were destroying books right and left.

09:37.421 --> 09:39.063
You've got to get to that pretty soon.

09:39.083 --> 09:41.327
Yes, I know.

09:42.370 --> 09:50.237
Anyhow, it was the first, and it was the major forum that they had.

09:50.297 --> 09:55.762
It was nothing else was happening that morning, and it was on women's literature.

09:55.782 --> 09:57.484
This again is still at Amherst?

09:57.644 --> 09:58.285
No, no, no.

09:58.305 --> 10:00.807
This was the Modern Language Association.

10:00.827 --> 10:02.729
Oh, this is the MLA.

10:02.749 --> 10:02.909
The MLA.

10:02.929 --> 10:03.470
Wow.

10:03.490 --> 10:08.995
So I'm mentioning all of these, you know, writers and talking about things.

10:09.175 --> 10:11.517
Well, I had no idea I was,

10:11.800 --> 10:19.452
saying what had not been said, because I didn't read criticism, academic books, and so forth and so on.

10:20.133 --> 10:30.008
So I stayed up all night with all this group that was nearly all women, with half a dozen guys, making up a reading list for them.

10:30.028 --> 10:31.431
Do you remember when this was?

10:31.451 --> 10:34.015
1971, December 1971.

10:34.115 --> 10:37.079
So two years after Amherst.

10:37.260 --> 10:38.702
Actually, the year after Amherst.

10:38.834 --> 10:50.814
It was the year after Amherst, and Elaine Hedges had thought to ask me because she'd heard a little bit about Amherst from Florence Howe.

10:51.335 --> 10:52.256
Who's Elaine Hedges?

10:52.617 --> 10:54.981
Elaine Hedges, who I just lost.

10:56.904 --> 11:04.116
This last year has been terrible on very unexpected death, plus some very beloved...

11:04.754 --> 11:16.145
terminal illnesses that at least you know about and have that strange kind of preparation and happiness when they no longer have that suffering.

11:16.466 --> 11:19.228
I'm sorry, I interrupted, but Elaine Hedges had advice.

11:19.329 --> 11:23.273
Well, Elaine Hedges is this professor at Tosin State.

11:23.793 --> 11:34.744
She was a graduate, I don't know, I think Barnard, and then she went to Harvard where she did her graduate work.

11:35.433 --> 11:49.917
And she was in charge of this panel, and she's the one who asked me to speak, and we became very close friends in the years since.

11:49.937 --> 11:59.072
And so I gave that, what in effect was that second talk, though that was edited, because I never have written a talk.

11:59.593 --> 12:00.715
It was all notes.

12:01.218 --> 12:09.673
Furthermore, somebody jogged my elbow walking up the aisle on these three-by-six cars, and it went all over, and I had to do without them.

12:10.935 --> 12:12.578
And I didn't know about time.

12:12.598 --> 12:13.860
I learned about time.

12:14.100 --> 12:19.670
There was a panel, and she had to shut me up, which I took in good grace.

12:19.770 --> 12:21.533
So did I learn.

12:21.573 --> 12:24.999
I mean, you know, there are things you should tell people ahead of time.

12:25.019 --> 12:26.702
Where was this, in New York?

12:26.885 --> 12:30.068
No, it was held in Chicago that year.

12:30.088 --> 12:32.151
It was held in Chicago that year.

12:32.191 --> 12:39.799
And so then I began to publish reading lists in the Women's Studies newsletter.

12:40.740 --> 12:42.642
But this was... Mostly fiction?

12:43.443 --> 12:44.023
No, no.

12:44.304 --> 12:44.904
No, no, no.

12:44.924 --> 12:47.007
It was fiction and nonfiction.

12:47.647 --> 12:53.854
And I had journals, and I had some poetry, too, occasionally.

12:54.172 --> 12:56.135
And I never finished the list.

12:56.235 --> 13:00.342
I mean, it ran for about three or four issues.

13:00.442 --> 13:16.028
I was going to do one on aging, you know, both youth and aging, the things that are college age or adolescent plus aging in the same list and so forth and so on.

13:16.767 --> 13:20.472
And so that got quite a circulation.

13:20.532 --> 13:39.079
And then, of course, people began reading on their own because they needed to teach, and it began the period where you went ahead and in the beginning you mimeographed, and then you had photocopying, and then came Xeroxing, and you were able to make up your own, what suited your students.

13:39.920 --> 13:46.369
And all this teaching of newer writers that had not been part of what was generally taught

13:46.906 --> 13:51.895
took place first in the community and state colleges, the public colleges.

13:52.516 --> 13:55.321
They were last of all in the elite colleges.

13:55.442 --> 14:07.564
Well, naturally, you think about it, you know, why would they suddenly take on a writer who they had never had themselves, who was not part of the canon?

14:08.067 --> 14:16.299
Do you have any thoughts on the canon debate, this whole debate that's going on, the great books debate, the Western canon, Harold Bloom?

14:16.659 --> 14:22.087
Well, I believe it's all your heritage.

14:22.327 --> 14:25.091
I believe it's like W.E.B.D.

14:26.353 --> 14:30.398
did in his Preface to Souls of Black Folk.

14:30.418 --> 14:36.707
Why would he quote an Irish, and like a lot of Irish writers,

14:37.143 --> 14:43.329
Why would he quote just a beautiful passage from Patrick Pierce?

14:44.310 --> 14:55.141
If you look at the souls of black folk and see, and then he'd have a phrase or two, say, from what he called the sorrow songs, you know, from his own people.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.983
It's all your human heritage.

14:58.003 --> 15:04.770
I believe absolutely that you should have what is the acknowledged great

15:05.122 --> 15:12.130
And you should also have a taste, and more than a taste, of those newer writers.

15:12.230 --> 15:23.543
Think of the blossoming of literature we've had in our country, the Nobel Prize winners, two of them, who came from people who a generation or two generations before were not readers.

15:24.164 --> 15:25.045
We're not readers.

15:25.145 --> 15:26.306
I mean, that's the thing.

15:28.649 --> 15:32.293
We had a period after World War II between the

15:32.459 --> 15:37.066
GI Bill and the sudden building all over this country.

15:37.486 --> 15:49.844
My God, I go back to where Agnes Smedley went to Arizona State Teachers Colleges, and there's a university there that has 25,000 students.

15:50.305 --> 15:54.771
I go to Youngstone, Ohio, where I just was, that was a steel town.

15:55.055 --> 15:56.156
and had nothing.

15:56.597 --> 16:01.122
And then I learned about other places, like, for instance, St.

16:01.162 --> 16:02.344
Joseph, Missouri.

16:02.404 --> 16:07.390
Somebody was at this wonderful Youngstown conference that I was at.

16:08.151 --> 16:19.245
And I learned that when the industries died out, when the chimneys no longer passed out smoke, a new industry arose, colleges.

16:19.905 --> 16:23.610
It was a certain period when we were establishing colleges.

16:23.995 --> 16:28.279
You go to Youngstown, it's so marvelous, that university there.

16:29.300 --> 16:29.441
Really?

16:29.461 --> 16:33.785
You know, and they produce readers.

16:33.985 --> 16:53.125
It was so exciting, the class that I went to, and not only readers, but I go to this where there's a home that's for older people, most of whom are the widows and a few of the guys who are still alive who also worked in those mills.

16:53.763 --> 17:02.655
Well, the students themselves, along with the faculty, they have book clubs there.

17:02.855 --> 17:03.376
Okay.

17:03.396 --> 17:04.317
And this is in Youngstown?

17:04.337 --> 17:05.038
In Youngstown.

17:05.058 --> 17:06.860
What's the name of the school, Youngstown?

17:07.101 --> 17:09.063
Youngstown State University.

17:09.304 --> 17:09.684
Oh, okay.

17:10.085 --> 17:18.496
You know, and then this wonderful guy, John Gilgan, who writes so beautifully, tells me about St.

17:18.996 --> 17:19.517
Joe.

17:19.885 --> 17:30.157
Missouri, where I went to try to organize slaughterhouses back in 1931 and what's happening there.

17:30.197 --> 17:40.991
And that's the industry and the love with which those who are the first generation to come to literature themselves to teach their students who come.

17:41.511 --> 17:44.695
And that's where a lot of this literature

17:45.012 --> 17:48.396
that was not in the canon has enormous value.

17:48.536 --> 17:58.428
You know, you do not only teach, say, I just mentioned it, Germinal.

17:58.929 --> 18:00.390
You know, you have a choice.

18:00.430 --> 18:05.376
You can teach and show the movie, for that matter of fact, of how green was my valley.

18:05.817 --> 18:12.825
Well, for instance, you know, you have, now I can't think of the name, oh, it's

18:13.345 --> 18:15.148
Well, it's set in the minds.

18:15.990 --> 18:33.820
Anyhow, and they bring in music, some of which is now in some of the anthologies, like the Heath anthology, I think, as Aunt Molly Jackson, who wrote, you know, she was a poet who was illiterate, and she wrote music.

18:33.940 --> 18:36.805
I mean, look at all, look at,

18:37.358 --> 18:41.043
Look at what was sung by slaves.

18:41.143 --> 18:44.047
And again, Thomas Wentworth Higginson, who you scorned?

18:44.507 --> 18:45.909
I scorned him.

18:46.049 --> 18:59.147
Well, he wrote the first piece when he heard the ex-slaves or those even who'd grown up in the North who fought in the Civil War.

18:59.527 --> 19:06.336
When he heard them sing and the words in those songs, he wrote a whole piece in the...

19:06.552 --> 19:10.597
You should read his notes of a black regiment.

19:10.657 --> 19:11.197
I think it's .

19:11.238 --> 19:11.318
.

19:11.338 --> 19:11.438
.

19:11.458 --> 19:12.639
I think it's .

19:12.659 --> 19:12.819
.

19:12.839 --> 19:12.980
.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.082
No, not that one.

19:15.422 --> 19:16.464
Not that one.

19:16.484 --> 19:17.245
Not that one.

19:17.385 --> 19:18.206
Not that one.

19:18.566 --> 19:24.113
There was a black regiment, finally, you know, although it had a white commander besides that one.

19:24.153 --> 19:29.439
And anyhow, the .

19:29.459 --> 19:29.479
.

19:29.499 --> 19:29.519
.

19:29.539 --> 19:30.781
and it's like in my .

19:30.801 --> 19:30.821
.

19:30.841 --> 19:30.861
.

19:30.881 --> 19:32.863
oh, yes, when I was paying tribute.

19:33.367 --> 19:40.877
to what suddenly was called Ebonics or something, a certain use of language, marvelous use of oral language.

19:40.917 --> 20:00.943
That's what this piece is partly about that was written, you know, for this around the original, yes, which I wrote all of us when I had that time, and it wasn't that much time because I had a family and a lot of things going on, but what I wrote was the

20:01.447 --> 20:06.975
in that free time that Stanford gave me where I didn't work on a job.

20:07.676 --> 20:10.700
So just briefly on this canon matter.

20:10.881 --> 20:11.702
Yeah, I know.

20:11.742 --> 20:13.064
You mentioned Scott Turow.

20:13.404 --> 20:24.601
He told me of an instance at Amherst where Amherst had graduated summa cum laude, an English major who had never taken a course in Shakespeare.

20:25.662 --> 20:30.289
What's... Well, that to me, Shakespeare is part of your...

20:30.556 --> 20:31.397
Heritage.

20:31.998 --> 20:39.851
You see, I'm against the dumbing down, but the real dumbing down doesn't happen there.

20:40.231 --> 20:49.125
And I'd like to have a lot of this passion around the true denial of literature to youngsters.

20:49.706 --> 20:53.171
The fact that public schools are so terrible.

20:53.872 --> 20:57.458
Listen, if you read Mayanandio,

20:57.961 --> 21:00.424
I have to find that piece for you.

21:00.524 --> 21:02.766
I was starting to go through this box.

21:03.106 --> 21:06.530
You're doing very well, but I hope you're not getting tired, by the way.

21:06.590 --> 21:08.392
No, no, no, no, no.

21:08.912 --> 21:18.322
But you see, Anna in there says to her kids, that's what books is.

21:18.843 --> 21:21.986
Places you've never been.

21:22.026 --> 21:24.108
Inside people's heads.

21:24.409 --> 21:24.829
Who says this?

21:25.383 --> 21:29.830
The Mother in Yanandio that I wrote when I was very young.

21:29.850 --> 21:33.296
I wrote that in my early 20s.

21:33.937 --> 21:35.139
That's what books is.

21:35.560 --> 21:38.425
Well, let's see if I can't find that.

21:38.465 --> 21:41.250
I was just beginning to dig into this thing.

21:41.310 --> 21:43.293
I'll find it.

21:43.313 --> 21:44.735
This is published, right?

21:44.755 --> 21:50.445
Yes, I know, but I quoted from it as something having to do about libraries.

21:51.050 --> 22:19.875
um uh by the way i'm sure you have a copy of that yes and actually i don't have a copy of it you don't have a copy of it well i have a better copy well of that but anyhow no i wrote it down i saw teacher last night i see well here's a better one you see well i made whole selections to send out to influential people at the time when we were being trashed in newspaper editorials and op-ed pieces

22:20.108 --> 22:28.020
We who were objecting to this magnificent new Maine, what was the matter with us?

22:28.140 --> 22:31.405
I mean, the whole town... Sure, you can have it.

22:31.825 --> 22:35.230
I probably have a number of copies of it.

22:35.250 --> 22:36.152
Okay, but I interrupted.

22:36.172 --> 22:36.732
I apologize.

22:36.853 --> 22:41.279
I was, well, about the... This new Maine, we were objecting to this new Maine.

22:42.220 --> 22:47.348
Well, we were criticizing the building...

22:47.750 --> 22:53.178
We were criticizing the fact there weren't enough books on the shelves.

22:53.198 --> 22:55.021
We were wondering where the books were.

22:55.041 --> 22:56.263
It was very thin.

22:56.283 --> 23:00.029
We were asking questions about where the money had gone.

23:00.069 --> 23:01.531
We still don't really know.

23:01.551 --> 23:09.103
I mean, you know why they just have, there's still none of, there's been no breakdown as who was getting what kind of salaries.

23:09.584 --> 23:11.907
Wonderful PR was done, as you know.

23:11.967 --> 23:13.670
There was such excitement.

23:13.690 --> 23:14.972
I was excited.

23:15.172 --> 23:18.335
I was not one of the writers who trooped through earlier.

23:18.355 --> 23:23.761
There were pictures for weeks in advance, you know, and I didn't go to the opening.

23:23.861 --> 23:32.109
I wanted to really be able to see and not have to be so packed with people that I couldn't really browse around.

23:32.129 --> 23:32.850
So you were excited?

23:33.471 --> 23:35.092
Oh, of course I was excited.

23:35.252 --> 23:36.273
I was thrilled.

23:36.994 --> 23:39.897
I was absolutely thrilled.

23:40.349 --> 23:44.894
We passed that bond measure for the library.

23:44.914 --> 23:47.336
78 percent of the people voted for it.

23:47.416 --> 23:48.057
That's amazing.

23:48.277 --> 23:48.577
Yes.

23:48.758 --> 23:49.659
Unbelievable.

23:49.679 --> 23:51.380
Well, we did a job.

23:51.420 --> 23:55.465
The Friends of the Public Library have never gotten the credit that they should have.

23:55.865 --> 23:57.286
Dowland was one of the people.

23:57.326 --> 23:58.267
That didn't matter.

23:58.328 --> 24:00.630
What mattered was the Library Foundation.

24:01.391 --> 24:06.576
Well, you know, part of what, you know, it was a big society thing.

24:06.893 --> 24:13.259
You know, and a wonderful job that was done in neighborhoods with support.

24:13.399 --> 24:15.521
See, we're getting around to the library now.

24:18.723 --> 24:32.476
What they did was to give people from the neighborhood, well, by the way, among other things, if you gave a dollar, you could have a little thing put up on a book.

24:32.976 --> 24:36.259
That was part of what violated me, not the dollar thing.

24:36.661 --> 24:41.107
It was, for instance, I had mentioned working in slaughterhouses.

24:41.807 --> 24:55.545
To have the heir of Hormel, and I'd been the Hill professor at the University of Minnesota at the time of a huge strike there that had lasted a year and three quarters already.

24:56.005 --> 25:02.854
And he had, it was just like back in the late 30s and 40s,

25:03.070 --> 25:05.494
He had armed people and so forth and so on.

25:05.514 --> 25:07.617
This was the father of the heir.

25:08.118 --> 25:13.046
And here, if you give a million dollars, you get a room named after you.

25:13.126 --> 25:15.430
Well, I'm against that kind of thing.

25:16.212 --> 25:19.577
And to see on every single thing people's

25:19.844 --> 25:49.227
people's names if you gave so much then you got a plaque you know it could be done discreetly you could have people who gave a lot of money have their names engraved downstairs in a whole list you know and have it hanging there and it's unobtrusive but if you want to know who gave a lot of money their their names why would why would why would be there but instead it was there was not a single bookshelf that didn't you know use that

25:49.510 --> 25:53.999
as a money-raising thing, but to get back to the neighborhoods.

25:54.400 --> 26:05.882
So here you were, and you were invited to these affairs where you might get your picture taken along with society people, and the papers published it, you know.

26:06.149 --> 26:09.054
And I didn't object to that at the time at all.

26:09.114 --> 26:15.123
You know, I wasn't paying, you know, but it was part of the nice PR about a people's library.

26:15.504 --> 26:24.418
Though I did note very bitterly that never before had there been any attention to or support for the public library.

26:25.059 --> 26:31.650
Well, then comes, I see I have the right thing in front of me, looking for my own piece that I wrote.

26:32.035 --> 26:43.830
for the Friends of the Public Library thing, where I was going to be giving a talk and doing a reading.

26:46.353 --> 26:47.615
So I read this.

26:48.075 --> 26:54.123
I read it on the bus over to Marin County, where I was going to a family birthday.

26:56.286 --> 27:01.873
Now, supposedly the people who use the library should be the ones to direct its internal design.

27:02.140 --> 27:05.764
Well, if you don't have this, by all means, you must have it.

27:05.785 --> 27:06.185
I have it.

27:06.225 --> 27:06.986
I think it's coming in.

27:07.006 --> 27:08.067
Okay, well, all right.

27:08.548 --> 27:14.055
But you see, even looking at this, I was totally unprepared for the whole thing.

27:14.235 --> 27:15.436
So what did you think when you saw that?

27:16.418 --> 27:18.020
When you saw this, what did you think?

27:18.360 --> 27:24.788
I felt, what a waste of space, plus the fact, how are you going to have quiet?

27:25.269 --> 27:31.236
You know, one of the things that distinguished a library was you went in...

27:32.380 --> 27:36.724
And people could talk, but you were quiet.

27:37.285 --> 27:38.346
You had a quiet.

27:38.506 --> 27:40.808
Quiet has to do with concentration.

27:41.589 --> 27:43.211
That was part of my horror.

27:45.713 --> 27:50.058
This was before I even started walking around.

27:50.818 --> 27:56.324
Well, I'm... The acoustics are wonderful in here.

27:56.724 --> 27:57.905
It could be a concert hall.

27:58.366 --> 27:59.927
You can hear things dropping.

27:59.947 --> 28:00.548
You can hear...

28:01.220 --> 28:02.722
The sound.

28:02.802 --> 28:03.883
You have chamber music.

28:03.903 --> 28:08.288
And I was horrified when I walked into the music room where you're supposed to have quiet.

28:08.308 --> 28:18.701
And you can have earmuffs on if you listen to certain things, but it's right where the constant elevator is so thoughtless.

28:19.522 --> 28:21.484
And then, of course, walking around.

28:21.924 --> 28:30.014
And I walk well, but I thought, my God, why do they do this to people who may have a problem?

28:30.074 --> 28:30.855
Mm-hmm.

28:30.987 --> 28:37.754
you know, who aren't in a wheelchair, but who are many people my age, you know, they don't go up and down stairs easily.

28:37.894 --> 28:44.080
I live upstairs, you know, and I'm a walker and so forth and so on, and I do stretches.

28:44.561 --> 28:48.565
But I was still very, very excited, you know, before I went.

28:49.045 --> 29:00.657
And I read this, the library of the future, a high-tech palace of democracy, the architects, you know, and so forth and so on, and anyhow,

29:01.008 --> 29:08.778
But Temco does have one demur that I marked at the time.

29:09.459 --> 29:19.392
Even so, the books make a formidable visual impression, so that in some ways the new main library seems as friendly as the old branch library.

29:20.032 --> 29:27.522
I think that that was the last time that the papers for months published anything

29:28.548 --> 29:31.933
that was at all critical of the new Maine.

29:33.335 --> 29:36.159
And I was totally unaware of it.

29:36.900 --> 29:57.070
And I am interviewed for what is to be a TV special of three of us white-haired artifacts who were users of the library from way back.

29:57.455 --> 30:03.101
Dorothy Bryant, Jade Snow Wong, and me for Channel 9.

30:03.141 --> 30:05.383
It was also a show nationally special.

30:06.184 --> 30:08.967
Well, Spencer Michael asked me.

30:09.067 --> 30:12.170
I'm very tactful, actually.

30:12.210 --> 30:16.435
And, you know, he expects me.

30:16.495 --> 30:22.281
First of all, it was my first encounter with the fact you're supposed to trash the horrors of the old Maine.

30:22.548 --> 30:27.414
Well, I had not been to any Library Commission meetings yet.

30:28.956 --> 30:44.657
The Old Main that I loved so and learned so much from, and my kids, well, I have to find you that particular piece that I wrote for the Friends of the Library before the Old Main had opened, that is

30:45.059 --> 30:59.659
the only published tribute to what is now called the Old Main, which it is, that says over it, May this structure throned on imperishable book

31:00.449 --> 31:30.304
be cherished from generation to generation for the delight and improvement of humankind that's what's inscribed on the you can go and look when you go to the well you'll have to have a panoramic camera because it goes all the way across and you see the heads it's true they're all men but so what i'm not going to object to that at the period that that library was set up it is

31:30.976 --> 31:32.397
What W.E.V.

31:32.437 --> 31:40.105
Du Bois cherished in his soul as a black folk, part of our greatest human heritage.

31:41.426 --> 31:43.929
It's those great thinkers and writers.

31:44.730 --> 31:50.335
Let the tape recorder, for the record, know that you recited that from memory.

31:50.756 --> 31:53.458
You didn't read that inscription from anything.

31:53.599 --> 31:54.960
You just happened to know that.

31:55.340 --> 32:00.105
No, I remember when I first came to San Francisco, and I loved...

32:00.811 --> 32:04.817
The old, I love the Omaha Public Library.

32:05.758 --> 32:12.568
But let me tell you, when I saw that, I got tears in my eyes.

32:13.168 --> 32:14.971
I thought, isn't that beautiful?

32:16.033 --> 32:18.556
You mean the first time in 1930 when you came here?

32:18.576 --> 32:19.137
That's right.

32:19.578 --> 32:20.218
That's right.

32:20.419 --> 32:21.000
That's right.

32:21.580 --> 32:23.443
In this so trashed building.

32:23.879 --> 32:32.611
the so-trashed building that meant so much to me and my kids and where I could be up reading and my kids were safe in that wonderful children's room.

32:33.172 --> 32:38.880
And I so wish Effie Lee were back from Europe so that you could talk to her.

32:38.941 --> 32:40.863
What a children's library.

32:40.923 --> 32:42.886
What an atmosphere she had there.

32:43.327 --> 32:45.450
It really belonged to the kids.

32:46.051 --> 32:50.477
And the kids, they learned somehow...

32:50.879 --> 32:55.104
Not to make a lot of noise, but they felt so at home in that place.

32:55.564 --> 33:16.549
The size of everything, the way the bookshelves were so low, the kind of pictures that were around, the fact that you always had crayons and paper and colored pencils and could write down things if you wanted and were encouraged to make notes, and Effie Lee would give kids sometimes

33:16.883 --> 33:20.950
notebooks if she, and pencils if she thought they did not.

33:20.970 --> 33:21.671
It was a library.

33:22.051 --> 33:23.053
It was a library.

33:23.634 --> 33:24.736
It was a library.

33:25.176 --> 33:26.058
Is this a library?

33:27.059 --> 33:28.181
Well, yes.

33:28.922 --> 33:32.648
It has books in it, and it has something else that's very necessary.

33:32.789 --> 33:44.207
It has computers, but it is primarily a place for information, not for the wings of imagination, not for

33:44.457 --> 33:49.563
That's what books is inside people's heads.

33:49.623 --> 33:53.108
You'd never get to know places.

33:54.810 --> 33:59.435
I asked you to go to the children's library and see what they have.

33:59.876 --> 34:11.410
You can watch on the computers what kind of children's books there are, and notice how many children are in the stacks and how many children

34:11.778 --> 34:16.303
And notice how much attention the librarians are paying.

34:16.363 --> 34:27.395
Now, I have not gone back from my survey since I went to Youngstown, and that was, let's see, when did I go to Cambridge?

34:27.435 --> 34:32.260
And I think it was early May, because I missed that Library Commission meeting.

34:32.681 --> 34:40.249
But imagine when I went to, I'm skipping slightly, to one of my first Library Commission meetings,

34:40.786 --> 34:46.635
And I hear for the first time the necessity to trash the old Maine.

34:46.655 --> 34:52.865
If you read your clippings, there are a few quotes here and there.

34:53.686 --> 35:07.468
Well, Coulter found it necessary to have dug up from somebody an account back in, I think it was early 1970s, Rainy Day.

35:08.174 --> 35:15.041
And this person, the last name of the person was Mandel, wrote into the papers to object.

35:15.061 --> 35:24.169
Because the second he came into the newspaper room, there was this awful smell of all of these unwashed, which they probably were.

35:24.189 --> 35:26.511
There were still homeless around.

35:26.992 --> 35:35.039
And they did come into the library on rainy days, and they probably did smell.

35:35.140 --> 35:37.742
But he didn't watch what they were doing.

35:38.701 --> 35:40.703
They were reading newspapers.

35:41.364 --> 35:43.346
They were upstairs, some of them.

35:43.406 --> 35:46.749
They were reading books.

35:46.769 --> 35:48.751
So what's a public library for?

35:49.351 --> 36:01.103
I started to say something about where the real censorship is and where I'd like to have attention, and I got digressed, which is easy for me to do because all kinds of things— I love the digressions.

36:01.123 --> 36:02.384
You notice I haven't interrupted you.

36:02.404 --> 36:05.147
Well, all kinds of things get into my head.

36:05.397 --> 36:33.058
The basic censorship is, first of all, that the public schools are so bad, and it's like in the Anandio, where I have a section where the kids do not want to be taken by Anna to the library, where, or was it not through school that they had been taught that they were dumb, dumb, dumb.

36:33.494 --> 36:41.428
It was in one of the worst public schools, and the first grade, I think she did a wonderful job.

36:41.689 --> 36:58.118
I had some of those teachers who, as far as the other kids were concerned, I never had that attitude, because they were great in sports, and they all were taller than me, and they loved me because I, like I loved, I looked up to them, and they looked up to me.

36:58.283 --> 37:01.926
because I would sometimes help them and try to teach them.

37:02.186 --> 37:07.932
I'd take a book, you know, the book, and never mind why that particular part of it.

37:08.712 --> 37:14.257
But the censorship, basic censorship, starts there.

37:14.938 --> 37:16.679
Now, what should a library be?

37:16.739 --> 37:17.920
Is this a library?

37:18.381 --> 37:27.649
If you're talking about the new Maine alone, I would say in the function it has taken on, just speaking of these kids,

37:28.675 --> 37:33.121
This library should have spent some of all the money that was spent.

37:33.902 --> 37:37.487
It should spend it to bookmobiles.

37:38.228 --> 37:39.850
What's wrong with bookmobiles?

37:39.870 --> 37:40.912
They're wonderful things.

37:41.012 --> 37:49.644
Well, they do have bookmobiles, but they're primarily for senior centers, which, I mean, you know, of course it's fine.

37:50.184 --> 37:54.811
Listen, we need just as much access as possible.

37:55.291 --> 37:57.214
Coulter's was accessible.

37:57.481 --> 37:58.922
something discover.

37:59.163 --> 38:00.724
Oh, I saw it.

38:00.764 --> 38:04.528
That's actually because he's using it as a verb when it's a noun.

38:04.548 --> 38:04.868
Yes.

38:05.689 --> 38:07.051
Well, and so what?

38:07.111 --> 38:09.053
I mean, that to me is perfectly fine.

38:09.113 --> 38:19.543
Language has always had more flexible uses, you know, through the years and has been added to and what's legitimate and so forth and so on.

38:20.164 --> 38:22.746
But there is such a job.

38:22.806 --> 38:24.568
If only they would enable

38:25.358 --> 38:33.250
There was a letter that I, where did I put it?

38:33.270 --> 38:39.019
It was right on top here that was in the paper just a few weeks ago.

38:39.680 --> 38:42.684
I'll have to mail it to you.

38:42.844 --> 38:46.590
A letter to the editor where she pointed out the joy

38:46.823 --> 38:48.867
of the school library that she had.

38:48.887 --> 38:51.713
I'll leave a couple of my cards in case you lose the envelope.

38:51.733 --> 38:59.008
Well, the joy and, well, I'd put one there and the other here, because this is where I stick stuff to put away.

38:59.068 --> 39:08.427
And so she writes this letter about the joy that she had and all she learned from her school library.

39:08.778 --> 39:13.295
Now, we did not have a school library in my eighth grade school.

39:13.355 --> 39:15.704
We were in a section that did not.

39:15.905 --> 39:18.535
Already, if you were in a certain neighborhood,

39:19.257 --> 39:26.146
And I think because it was Omaha that came in later, because New York had wonderful libraries in all of the neighborhoods.

39:26.407 --> 39:28.149
It's marvelous, you know.

39:28.169 --> 39:33.997
My in-laws grew up in New York, and they were the children of immigrants, and they said they had wonderful libraries.

39:34.017 --> 39:37.822
I know, and with the white librarians, too, you know.

39:38.262 --> 39:39.885
I love librarians.

39:39.905 --> 39:41.126
Oh, I do, too.

39:41.226 --> 39:43.189
I put them in the category of nurses.

39:43.169 --> 39:46.814
Well, with certain teachers, too, with the best teachers.

39:46.995 --> 39:51.461
I mean, those are the really sacred people in our... They're givers.

39:51.541 --> 39:52.262
They really are.

39:52.443 --> 39:53.985
Right, right, right.

39:54.005 --> 40:12.552
In our world, and one of the joys to me of beginning to be active, though it was the same time I also got involved, because it was very close to me to a case of police brutality, and I noticed when I was digging out clippings, I had some of those clippings mixed up with the library clippings,

40:13.055 --> 40:34.524
But to get back to the whole subject of illiteracy, and by the way, the library does have, it didn't come, it started in the old Maine, and they still have this group that teaches literacy classes through the, you know.

40:34.544 --> 40:41.593
That was also something that began with the Friends of the Public Library, I believe.

40:41.877 --> 40:44.980
But I met some of those wonderful, wonderful people.

40:45.681 --> 40:50.385
And, you know, but this is all their own volunteer.

40:50.445 --> 40:54.949
They're not connected with the library, but they use the library.

40:55.170 --> 40:58.953
I understand there's one man who keeps getting up at every library commission meeting.

40:59.754 --> 41:04.799
And all he asks is, will you please keep the library open a little longer?

41:05.279 --> 41:05.519
Yes.

41:05.579 --> 41:07.701
All he wants is normal hours.

41:08.082 --> 41:08.442
Yes.

41:08.573 --> 41:12.521
instead of closing it so you could have parties there and receptions.

41:12.541 --> 41:14.825
Well, they really don't have that many.

41:14.866 --> 41:23.302
There's a list that, and you probably got one of those lists of, you know, who used the library and when and so forth and so on.

41:24.565 --> 41:27.210
But the library is large enough for both.

41:27.310 --> 41:30.717
But it has to do, to me, with a certain elite attitude.

41:31.000 --> 41:39.769
We don't know who comes in, and it might disturb, you know, what else is going on, and it doesn't need to be that way.

41:39.790 --> 41:46.497
To start, go back to all the wonderful feeling about the library.

41:46.537 --> 41:59.691
It's curious to me that none of the people, the groups, who were so pleased, and one of them, a group of them got together and wrote a very angry letter about our group.

42:01.240 --> 42:10.825
You know, none of them have ever come to commission meetings, but it was the gay and lesbian group around the world.

42:10.845 --> 42:14.895
And yet we have, well, again, how do you know?

42:15.280 --> 42:23.210
Well, we have lesbians and gay, you know, who come to commission meetings from time to time to time.

42:23.270 --> 42:29.358
It's amazing to me that people who are trying to fight for a library would be the subject of it.

42:29.378 --> 42:36.006
But, you know, there has not been any kind of

42:36.728 --> 42:50.327
again, quote, outreach to get some of those community people to come to the library and be involved in the library and even use the library if you go to the different group names.

42:50.407 --> 43:00.702
Now, the Gay and Lesbian Center is somewhat used, and most certainly the Afro-American Center is somewhat used.

43:00.722 --> 43:05.048
But it's used pretty much by...

43:05.264 --> 43:08.068
not so much by those who are readers.

43:08.269 --> 43:10.832
What kind of scholarly collections are there?

43:10.973 --> 43:12.094
Well, which is fine.

43:12.515 --> 43:17.442
Well, it's a mixed collection, but there are things, and again, I could be critical.

43:17.502 --> 43:19.646
We should go back to what happened to me.

43:19.686 --> 43:30.462
So anyhow, there I am, and I'm speaking to Spencer Michaels, and I mentioned that there are far less books, well, especially

43:30.593 --> 43:44.871
Well, in the literature, biography, autobiography, poetry, and he looks at me and says, oh no, and he rattles off to me how there's so much more shelf space than the old library had.

43:44.931 --> 43:47.414
These were the official figures that were given out.

43:47.434 --> 43:59.689
And if you read your clippings, this is what all along until recently, you know, when Kathy Page, poor Kathy Page, by the way, I have a lot of respect for her, but she was the front person

43:59.888 --> 44:01.150
who had to lie.

44:03.014 --> 44:09.245
In effect, they were already knowing, you know, and they already knew they didn't have room for books, you know, from the beginning.

44:09.686 --> 44:14.434
The pages were the ones who first, they issued something.

44:14.474 --> 44:24.512
It was such a wonderful piece that the pages did, telling what the situation was in Brooks Hall, their own situation, having to go down

44:24.779 --> 44:30.528
and get books that they knew weren't there, you know, but presumably were supposed to be there.

44:31.570 --> 44:39.202
Well, or maybe was in, you know, mass where nobody had to put them up in shelves, some of them were getting milled.

44:39.282 --> 44:41.506
Well, you know the whole story of the books.

44:42.367 --> 44:52.423
Well, but to get back to me, so everything I have to say about the library, you know, and then he wants me to contrast

44:52.775 --> 44:58.202
how terrible the old Maine was and how wonderful the new Maine was.

44:58.222 --> 44:59.444
This was on a TV program.

44:59.484 --> 45:01.046
For this TV program.

45:01.406 --> 45:06.353
Well, I tell him how wonderful it was for my kids and for me.

45:06.433 --> 45:10.078
Well, anyhow... That's not what he wanted to hear.

45:10.098 --> 45:16.246
And I didn't... He was very polite, but he kept asking me questions.

45:16.306 --> 45:17.668
How were the librarians?

45:18.273 --> 45:23.980
So, of course, me and my peons to librarians, you know.

45:24.680 --> 45:29.566
Well, the half hour came out.

45:30.247 --> 45:32.009
I am on the cutting room floor.

45:32.529 --> 45:34.431
I am not included in that.

45:34.632 --> 45:35.373
I was cut.

45:36.013 --> 45:37.375
Now, he never called me.

45:37.735 --> 45:39.577
He had his assistant call me.

45:39.657 --> 45:41.860
She was very, very apologetic.

45:42.561 --> 45:47.166
She was stumbling around poor lamb, and she said to me,

45:47.737 --> 45:51.082
It just is that we didn't have enough room.

45:51.322 --> 45:52.023
What's his name?

45:52.063 --> 45:52.724
I'll call him.

45:52.924 --> 45:54.126
Spencer Michaels.

45:54.166 --> 45:55.488
You ask him about that.

45:55.708 --> 45:56.950
Ask him how it is.

45:57.171 --> 45:57.892
Spencer, is he a local fellow?

45:58.072 --> 45:58.553
Oh, yes.

45:58.813 --> 45:59.234
Oh, yes.

45:59.314 --> 46:00.596
Well, he often comments.

46:00.676 --> 46:02.058
I've never seen him since.

46:02.558 --> 46:05.342
But when I see him, I'm going to ask him.

46:05.362 --> 46:07.025
Well, I'll say, you know, I understand.

46:07.085 --> 46:10.370
But I asked Holder, and he didn't, to apologize.

46:10.430 --> 46:10.690
Mm-hmm.

46:11.362 --> 46:12.644
to apologize.

46:13.265 --> 46:15.789
So I'll ask him.

46:15.809 --> 46:26.505
And I told him about going up to the history room, and I told him about going about the labor books.

46:27.046 --> 46:38.584
And I was, you know, I couched these things very nicely, even in the question of, well, I said, you know, why the labor collection is really very, very thin, and this is

46:39.172 --> 46:41.434
outstanding as a labor town.

46:41.774 --> 46:45.578
And I said, we have remarkable labor.

46:45.598 --> 46:51.803
So when you started, when you began to learn about... So, yes, so I began to learn.

46:51.984 --> 46:54.846
That books were being dumped, though.

46:55.126 --> 46:56.748
Oh, well, I didn't know that yet.

46:56.948 --> 46:58.129
I didn't know that yet.

46:58.870 --> 47:00.131
I want to find, get your reaction.

47:00.151 --> 47:06.917
Well, although we knew after the earthquake that a lot of books had been just dumped.

47:07.707 --> 47:09.129
They used that as an excuse.

47:10.051 --> 47:11.633
They used that as an excuse.

47:11.673 --> 47:14.237
Well, this was Dowland's attitude about books.

47:14.257 --> 47:15.919
It was under Dowland's regime.

47:15.979 --> 47:18.804
I'm seeing him, by the way, on Thursday night.

47:18.824 --> 47:24.192
Well, it should be very interesting, and you should read the talk that he gave.

47:24.212 --> 47:26.876
He only gave one talk.

47:26.896 --> 47:30.281
And the talk, do you know what the talk was about?

47:30.521 --> 47:31.182
No.

47:31.202 --> 47:35.048
Well, the first few minutes was a tribute to books and librarians.

47:35.348 --> 47:37.771
Then it was the wonders of computers.

47:38.172 --> 47:40.415
He envisioned the library of the future.

47:40.976 --> 47:44.781
We would be able to get the Berlin Library online.

47:44.821 --> 47:49.067
We would be able to get Topio Library online.

47:49.728 --> 47:52.191
Everything was going to be accessible to us.

47:52.572 --> 47:58.180
Well, how many people who come to the library know foreign languages and need that?

47:58.580 --> 48:02.065
It's a comparatively small group, and they should be served, too.

48:02.315 --> 48:05.319
Very, very, very, very much they should be served.

48:05.339 --> 48:06.081
We have college.

48:06.101 --> 48:07.262
We have university libraries.

48:07.282 --> 48:18.479
Well, but this is a public library, a public library in a city where the public schools, most of them, although we have the Rosa Parks School.

48:18.759 --> 48:22.185
You can see it from here just a block and a half away.

48:22.205 --> 48:24.388
You can see the Raphael Wheel School.

48:24.969 --> 48:29.736
And they are going to have a library because it's the Rosa Parks School.

48:30.417 --> 48:31.258
But anyhow...

48:31.812 --> 48:44.491
This is a library in a city that has many, many immigrants as well as those who are not readers because they don't come from book homes.

48:47.355 --> 49:00.435
And it needs a consciousness that these are the people especially who have a need for libraries being brought into libraries and having the library come to them.

49:00.652 --> 49:07.700
I've several times gotten up at commission meetings where there's been the appropriate occasion to talk about this.

49:07.740 --> 49:11.945
This was the time when there was money, before the big deficit.

49:11.965 --> 49:30.405
Now, anyhow, it was at the time when I was there for the videotaping of Spencer Michaels' piece that Kathy Bremer came up to me, and she said...

49:30.672 --> 49:35.457
Because she knew I was a book lover, you know, and so forth and so on.

49:35.557 --> 49:38.059
And silence has a few librarians.

49:38.159 --> 49:42.043
It's partly acknowledged, too, among other things.

49:43.264 --> 49:47.708
And she said that she wanted to invite me to a meeting.

49:47.868 --> 49:51.412
It's going to be mostly librarians, but also some others.

49:52.473 --> 49:59.059
And they'd like to hear what my response, you know, how I feel about the library.

49:59.512 --> 50:04.798
And that's when I began to become part of this marvelous group.

50:05.499 --> 50:08.122
They are such wonderful beings, let me tell you.

50:08.222 --> 50:10.886
And some of them really put themselves on the line.

50:10.906 --> 50:12.668
I was this morning with Walter.

50:13.309 --> 50:13.909
Yes.

50:14.550 --> 50:16.452
I can't believe the work that he's done.

50:16.472 --> 50:16.813
I know.

50:17.414 --> 50:20.017
But he's sending me boxes of stuff by UPS.

50:20.417 --> 50:20.938
I'm sure.

50:20.958 --> 50:21.959
I can't carry it home with this.

50:21.979 --> 50:22.900
Well, I'm sure.

50:23.261 --> 50:25.864
Well, anyhow, but to get back to Dallin.

50:26.404 --> 50:28.607
Well, Dallin gives only one talk.

50:28.942 --> 50:32.848
And this talk is about, this is what his talk is about.

50:33.469 --> 50:37.075
It was supposed to have had a question and answer period.

50:38.017 --> 50:40.321
There is no question or answer period.

50:40.381 --> 50:41.743
He went over the time.

50:41.903 --> 50:44.047
That was his one public appearance.

50:45.108 --> 50:46.671
Well, what would you like to ask him?

50:46.691 --> 50:49.195
He presented, well...

50:50.086 --> 50:59.636
He presented at the meeting where he was, this was before the deficit was, but he was already on the hot seat.

51:00.677 --> 51:04.621
He presented, and I didn't have a chance to take a look at it.

51:04.641 --> 51:08.605
It's somewhere in one of the files here.

51:09.446 --> 51:19.536
He gave everybody this particular thing, which included his vision as to what libraries should be in his libraries of the future.

51:20.326 --> 51:26.616
Well, it was very interesting that he gave lip service in that, at least, to librarians.

51:27.998 --> 51:41.460
Then comes this meeting also when the deficit has been discovered, though we still don't know, as I said, in spite of the audits, who got what money on the staff.

51:41.981 --> 51:47.329
The librarians certainly did not get any big raises.

51:47.900 --> 51:52.264
any raises at all, I think, except there was a slight raise.

51:52.624 --> 51:54.266
You'd have to ask Kathy Bremer.

51:54.306 --> 51:56.027
Well, I have the material on that.

51:56.808 --> 51:58.489
Well, what is his proposal?

51:58.549 --> 52:04.935
It was the one that came in from the beginning, where the pages first spoke up.

52:05.936 --> 52:14.663
The new Maine opened all that money with many less pages than the old Maine had.

52:14.684 --> 52:16.405
They cut back on the pages.

52:16.655 --> 52:18.497
They cut back on the pages.

52:18.958 --> 52:20.820
Now there is, you should have it.

52:20.900 --> 52:23.683
If not, I'll send you my complete file.

52:24.985 --> 52:37.600
They issued something to the public saying how much they'd been cut and what it meant for the reshelving of books on the library.

52:38.381 --> 52:43.827
See, I didn't as yet realize that part of the reason things were so difficult

52:43.992 --> 52:48.616
there were such spaces on certain aspects of the shelves.

52:48.716 --> 52:52.560
Not the technological library, not the business library.

52:53.080 --> 52:53.981
That was full.

52:55.762 --> 53:05.111
That was full, which I also noticed when I walked through the library with a more critical eye, having seen certain things.

53:05.591 --> 53:09.575
Well, so the pages published the first thing.

53:10.876 --> 53:13.358
And the fact of the staff being published.

53:13.625 --> 53:18.872
I thought, my God, how can anybody be so short-sighted?

53:18.952 --> 53:26.443
So that's why when I ask for books and they're on the computer, I don't get the books.

53:26.583 --> 53:29.928
I didn't yet know about the destruction of books since.

53:30.428 --> 53:33.873
Well, I met Dietrich at one of these meetings.

53:33.893 --> 53:34.654
Isn't she...

53:35.242 --> 53:36.526
I mean, what a heroine.

53:36.546 --> 53:41.661
We met last night at the Grey Panther's office, and she had her buttons on and the posters on.

53:41.681 --> 53:43.226
What a heroine she is.

53:43.306 --> 53:44.871
She is really a heroine.

53:45.052 --> 53:48.863
I don't know if she was too modest to give you some of the publicity about her.

53:49.163 --> 53:52.747
And by the way, she is one of the most hated people by Coulter.

53:55.010 --> 54:10.930
Well, anyhow, so if you see what Dowland's vision of the library of the future is and his practice, which you do is cut staff, you don't need staff, I really came to feel that that guy does not know.

54:10.970 --> 54:13.834
And I don't think Coulter realizes.

54:14.835 --> 54:17.398
Somebody has to be there to order the book.

54:17.632 --> 54:20.937
after it's decided you want to get new books.

54:20.957 --> 54:26.325
Somebody has to be there to open the cartons when they arrive.

54:27.447 --> 54:35.359
Somebody has to be there to shell those books where they belong as well as put them in a catalog.

54:35.379 --> 54:38.043
Somebody also has to catalog them, too.

54:38.063 --> 54:38.944
Yes, of course.

54:38.984 --> 54:39.826
Yes, of course.

54:39.906 --> 54:44.112
But you see, when I first began to come to the commission meetings,

54:44.497 --> 54:47.560
And I still feel that to this day, and I've said it.

54:48.522 --> 54:55.870
And I love Nicholson Baker, and he performed such a service for the library and for libraries general.

54:56.891 --> 55:08.164
But his focus on the card catalog, which I felt so strongly, I said from the beginning, they can do what the New York Public Library did.

55:08.204 --> 55:11.247
You know, there's that whole wall in the reading room.

55:11.497 --> 55:27.857
And somebody who's intimidated yet by a computer, which is most people who use the public libraries here and who are the ones we want most to attract, so they can use at the public library.

55:28.277 --> 55:31.601
They can look, and it's exactly like what's on the computer.

55:32.182 --> 55:39.090
It's the old card catalog, but it's in books, you know, A to...

55:39.357 --> 55:41.199
A to AB, maybe.

55:41.239 --> 55:42.320
That's the first book.

55:42.380 --> 55:46.985
You take it out, and there's the things pasted in.

55:47.025 --> 55:51.810
What a simple, beautiful, practical solution.

55:51.830 --> 55:59.697
And meanwhile, to have enough library staff, they can want to know if you need some help to find something.

56:00.158 --> 56:08.166
And they can, at a time, because sometimes people are the same readers, and they recognize them, show them.

56:08.585 --> 56:10.587
how to really use a computer.

56:10.607 --> 56:17.174
The computers are not user-friendly, which I recognized with my first time.

56:17.895 --> 56:22.020
I thought, my God, I'd rather go to the shelves and just browse.

56:22.520 --> 56:23.922
This is no use to me.

56:24.623 --> 56:29.027
But there were no card catalogs where I could have found things.

56:29.908 --> 56:31.770
It's like browsing.

56:31.810 --> 56:34.854
You browse in a card catalog.

56:35.494 --> 56:37.517
You don't browse on a computer.

56:37.537 --> 56:37.917
No, sir, no.

56:38.183 --> 56:39.845
You don't browse on a computer.

56:39.885 --> 56:43.349
Browsing is essential for those.

56:43.369 --> 56:44.350
Oh, I think so.

56:44.430 --> 56:47.473
Think of all the things we discovered through browsing.

56:47.553 --> 56:56.082
For me, for all my research at Widener at Harvard, the book that's always the most important book is not the one I went in to find.

56:56.102 --> 56:59.526
It's the one that was next to it, or over here.

57:00.067 --> 57:06.874
All of a sudden, my attention is something, and it's a book I've never heard of before, but it turns out to be marvelous.

57:07.107 --> 57:08.108
Well, that's browsing.

57:08.148 --> 57:09.009
That's serendipity.

57:09.049 --> 57:14.694
This takes almost over, too.

57:14.714 --> 57:16.896
Tell me when you start to get tired, by the way.

57:17.497 --> 57:17.597
What?

57:19.579 --> 57:27.366
What is it in here?

57:28.727 --> 57:36.895
Here's a piece that somebody wrote about my reading list, by the way, that you might want to have.

57:37.178 --> 57:53.483
that's in this ... and it has a lot about ... Well, you see, Robin Desard was a professor's wife.

57:54.244 --> 58:03.658
Now, of course, she's a professor, which was beginning to happen at the time that I was at Amherst.

58:03.740 --> 58:28.920
You may know this name because she's a Mark Twain scholar and is editing the complete edition of everything that Mark Twain ever published in the original, with reproductions of the original, you know, thing that so often had the photographs and so forth and so on.

58:30.282 --> 58:31.063
But...

58:32.714 --> 58:38.062
Anyway, no, this is very mixed.

58:38.462 --> 58:39.824
That's Oxford.

58:39.904 --> 58:41.607
Oxford, yeah.

58:41.627 --> 58:43.830
1994.

58:43.870 --> 58:49.498
Well, that's not just about me, this book.

58:49.598 --> 58:56.207
Well, it has, you know, some pieces.

58:57.048 --> 59:05.137
Then it has, you know, some other things that are all around, silences, which... Oh, me.

59:07.619 --> 59:10.282
I have access to wonderful libraries, by the way.

59:10.362 --> 59:13.426
All I need is titles, and I can find them.

59:15.107 --> 59:16.889
So, are you getting tired, by the way?

59:16.909 --> 59:17.430
Let me know.

59:17.690 --> 59:18.651
Are you getting tired?

59:19.172 --> 59:20.854
No, I don't get tired, though.

59:20.874 --> 59:22.535
I'm going to stand for a while.

59:22.556 --> 59:24.878
Okay, because we've got... I'm not much for sitting...

59:25.010 --> 59:39.544
too long, and so anyhow, my excitement, and then I began to learn what was happening behind the scenes, and then I discovered, to my great shock, that I could write a letter to the editor and they didn't publish it.

59:41.626 --> 59:43.167
Amazing, huh?

59:43.187 --> 59:53.717
Well, I didn't write too many letters, but I tried three different times, that there were editorials and these op-ed pieces

59:54.153 --> 01:00:20.498
about us about the group we were called luddites you still are he called you he's he called you luddites yesterday as a matter of fact i see well you see luddites uh i wonder if he knows what a luddite is well i don't even i i don't think he really does he probably picked it up and maybe even and maybe somebody even told him uh uh but um

01:00:20.917 --> 01:00:26.389
And of course, Luddites had a reason they were losing their livelihoods.

01:00:27.451 --> 01:00:36.732
And in a sense, maybe it's true because we were losing our books, but we didn't go around destroying things.
