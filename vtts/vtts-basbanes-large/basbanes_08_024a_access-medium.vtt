00:02.174 --> 00:05.919
That looks like it's turning.

00:05.959 --> 00:07.220
I don't have my glasses on.

00:07.320 --> 00:08.522
Yes, it does.

00:09.463 --> 00:09.823
Thank you.

00:09.843 --> 00:13.408
Congratulations on this wonderful new book.

00:14.029 --> 00:20.456
I guess maybe to enter the discussion, the concept of it, you are doing a quartet of novels, I gather.

00:20.476 --> 00:21.037
Yes.

00:21.157 --> 00:25.923
Maybe if you could just tell me a little bit about that, the motivation for that.

00:27.225 --> 00:28.266
Why a quartet?

00:28.955 --> 00:43.112
I think at first I had the idea of writing a sort of long novel because it was partly with reading Proust when I was at college or just after.

00:44.293 --> 00:53.264
And then I had this idea that I had lived through a little bit of history, what was the war in the 1950s.

00:53.404 --> 00:55.907
I sort of had the idea at the beginning of the 60s that

00:56.444 --> 00:58.126
actually had a sense of time.

00:58.227 --> 01:04.916
I think when you start writing novels in your early 20s, you don't actually have a sense of time having fast.

01:05.677 --> 01:09.523
So I thought I would write a longish novel with several main characters.

01:10.605 --> 01:14.010
And then it became a quartet.

01:14.150 --> 01:24.645
The idea was originally to have the first one, which was The Virgin in the Garden, as a kind of nostalgic looking back to the days of Shakespearean English.

01:25.385 --> 01:29.129
and possibly also the big 19th century novel.

01:29.890 --> 01:42.744
Then I was going to do two more experimental ones, which was Still Life, which was going to be what I thought of as my biological novel, describing birth and death very, very barely and precisely.

01:42.784 --> 01:48.370
Then this one was always meant to be the linguistic novel, which is why it's called Babel Tower.

01:48.390 --> 01:49.671
It was meant to be the one about

01:50.258 --> 01:55.524
how language flew apart into fragments and everybody began to speak with a closed.

01:55.544 --> 01:57.146
It's a wonderful title.

01:57.166 --> 01:58.208
It's a good title, yes.

01:58.268 --> 02:01.111
It was called Evidence for a long time when I was thinking about it.

02:01.131 --> 02:04.015
Then it came to me with its real name, this Babel Tower.

02:04.035 --> 02:10.482
And then, of course, they were able to put all sorts of, after that, metaphors of towers began to proliferate all over it.

02:10.502 --> 02:13.005
Did the title come while it was a work in progress?

02:13.366 --> 02:15.548
Yes, it came quite late, really.

02:16.209 --> 02:16.890
I don't know much.

02:17.292 --> 02:20.596
No, probably sort of at the beginning of the 90s, end of the 80s.

02:21.517 --> 02:24.861
So how long was this work in progress, may I ask?

02:25.122 --> 02:28.746
Well, I've been thinking about it, all of it, you know, bits of it, since about 1963.

02:28.826 --> 02:31.870
I've been thinking for quite a long time, yes.

02:32.951 --> 02:35.554
And when I've done the fourth one, that will be the end.

02:36.516 --> 02:37.877
You think?

02:37.897 --> 02:42.523
I'm pretty sure, because I've got another two books after that that I want to write.

02:43.398 --> 02:47.843
You say you've been thinking about this since the 60s, and of course you have those cases of the 60s.

02:48.284 --> 03:01.460
Did you kind of fix on them at that point, that you thought that they would be so... that you'd be using them as models for a novel in the late 1990s?

03:01.881 --> 03:08.629
Well, I hoped to write it in the 1970s, but all sorts of things intervened and got in the way.

03:09.385 --> 03:13.249
But I didn't mean to be writing it as late as the sort of mid-1990s.

03:13.369 --> 03:22.377
I think it's probably on balance gained from me having been thinking about it for 20 years rather than writing it.

03:22.397 --> 03:29.203
But do you write it, obviously you have to, but what's the perspective of a woman in the 1990s?

03:29.223 --> 03:30.044
Oh, I think so.

03:30.084 --> 03:38.852
I think there is much more, I think there's a different sort of ironic distance on the characters and the world than there would have been if I'd written it then.

03:39.288 --> 03:42.092
I think it's a good afternoon.

03:44.576 --> 03:48.743
How do you think it would have been different had you, in fact, done it in the 70s?

03:49.804 --> 04:00.661
There were a lot of things that in the 60s, late 60s, early 70s, I found rather tedious and repulsive, you know, like the sort of theatre of cruelty.

04:00.681 --> 04:02.644
It wasn't my favourite sort of theatre.

04:03.345 --> 04:07.692
And all this idea that you should believe the Marquis de Sade and all the need to live in

04:07.942 --> 04:36.852
communes and things and I found most of these you know not my sort of thing and not what I had been hoping for they're very interesting whereas now it all seems to me much more coherent as a set of movements and as a kind of spectrum of moral interest and moral anxiety you know from the immense sense of everybody loving everybody in whatever way they felt like all you need is love as the Beatles said

04:37.051 --> 04:48.864
at one end, and the sort of people like Peter Brook, the theater impresario, putting on the Marat Sade, with the Naki de Sade directing the Mad Men in a performance of the death of Marat.

04:49.825 --> 04:51.426
I think it was written by Peter Weiss.

04:52.808 --> 05:02.518
And that was done to sort of upset and shock the audience, and to send great faissons of pleasure and cruelty through your blood.

05:03.612 --> 05:27.392
um and I couldn't find a copy of it anywhere when I was writing this book in the 1990s. Really? And I finally got hold of one it's actually a very static and boring play. I think and I mean it's a brilliant idea that Marquis de Sade did put on plays in his lunatic asylum in Charenton um but

05:27.608 --> 05:29.491
That is a fascinating concept.

05:29.511 --> 05:33.117
Well, and it would have made a wonderful play when you actually read the play, as opposed to St.

05:33.157 --> 05:36.542
Peter Brook's sort of absolutely star production of it.

05:37.483 --> 05:41.029
It reads a bit stiff and wooden, and it goes rambling off.

05:41.089 --> 05:45.656
There were a lot of art forms in the 60s that were very rambling and sort of repetitive.

05:47.139 --> 05:53.869
Anyway, but I find it much more interesting now than I did then, because I see how it fits into the way everything worked.

05:54.862 --> 06:00.190
And at the time, you know, the Moore's murders, which keeps cropping up in this novel.

06:03.455 --> 06:06.700
On the whole, I turned away from them in terror and fear.

06:07.641 --> 06:18.658
You know, I didn't, I would scan the accounts of the trials of these people very, very fast, because I felt you ought to know what was happening, but I didn't want to

06:18.908 --> 06:21.131
linger on it, because it just made me feel too ill.

06:21.732 --> 06:25.197
Plus, you don't want it to be a work of journalism either, in that respect.

06:25.257 --> 06:26.940
No, I mean, then I didn't look at it.

06:27.120 --> 06:31.907
I did look at it now when I was doing the research, because it fitted.

06:32.007 --> 06:32.808
Do you like milk?

06:32.868 --> 06:34.771
Yeah, I just like when I'm black, thank you.

06:34.791 --> 06:35.031
Right.

06:37.315 --> 06:38.536
There's sugar there.

06:38.556 --> 06:39.898
Yes, no, I don't take sugar.

06:40.539 --> 06:45.827
I find if I drink too much black coffee, you get very jittery, and I've got very jittery anyway with

06:46.398 --> 06:48.200
I like the caffeine, actually.

06:48.220 --> 06:50.003
I like real proper caffeine.

06:52.426 --> 06:55.149
I'm sorry.

06:56.411 --> 07:03.239
I guess you've kind of answered the question of how you visualise the quartet.

07:03.259 --> 07:04.261
How does it fit in?

07:04.301 --> 07:06.924
Do you see this all as a corpus, as a body of work?

07:06.944 --> 07:10.088
I mean, would you like this all to be... What, all my work?

07:10.589 --> 07:14.734
Well, actually, I've not said this before, but I've had this interesting idea...

07:15.237 --> 07:23.467
I wrote Possession, which is around, set in the year of Darwin's writing of the Origin of Species in 1859.

07:25.330 --> 07:35.823
And then I wrote Angels and Insects, and the insects bit is in the 1860s, and the angels bit moves on into the 1870s, 1880s.

07:36.283 --> 07:42.291
I have a novel I want to write next when I finish the quartet, and the one I want to write after that

07:42.642 --> 07:47.428
is about that kind of group of people in the 1890s, 1900s.

07:48.489 --> 07:54.396
It's going to be done from the point of view or about a children's writer like E. Nesbitt.

07:54.416 --> 08:01.804
But she lived in a world which contained all the geneticists who believed in eugenics and all the proto-socialists.

08:01.904 --> 08:02.645
She knew H.G.

08:02.725 --> 08:04.367
Wells very well.

08:05.288 --> 08:06.990
He tried to seduce her daughter.

08:07.010 --> 08:09.493
She knew George Bernard Shaw.

08:09.693 --> 08:16.023
And I want to do something, I mean, it won't be like that, but that world, Havelock Ehrlich, all the earliest.

08:16.144 --> 08:19.008
But then in a sense, you see, I've got a great historical run.

08:19.449 --> 08:29.125
And the one I want to do after that, which doesn't yet have a title, or if it does, I've forgotten it because I'm so tired, is about two women psychoanalysts.

08:29.806 --> 08:30.988
Sounds wonderful.

08:31.449 --> 08:36.477
I wanted to do an American and a Middle European, but I think I can't write an American.

08:37.148 --> 08:42.815
So I think I'll write an English woman psychoanalyst in the time of Freud and Jung.

08:42.835 --> 08:45.078
You had a pretty good American in possession, though.

08:45.098 --> 08:52.366
I mean... Well, I was rather fond of both my Americans in possession, but I do know that they were broad-outline caricatures.

08:53.948 --> 09:03.780
I taught American literature for a long time, and I made Professor Crocker out of all the preoccupations of 19th-century American literature, you know, the kind of Gothic, the interest...

09:04.047 --> 09:08.693
The Edgar Allan Poe interest in mortality, and all those.

09:08.793 --> 09:15.561
He came out of all those communes that sprinkled around the time of Henry James and Hawthorne.

09:15.801 --> 09:25.313
One of the chapters in my own book, I did a chapter on the University of Texas, and the institutional bibliomania that took place there.

09:26.103 --> 09:30.294
this gluttonous desire to get everything.

09:30.575 --> 09:32.440
And you had it right on.

09:32.460 --> 09:33.903
Well, he is it.

09:34.044 --> 09:35.788
I mean, I did actually.

09:35.828 --> 09:37.072
I got very fond of him.

09:37.212 --> 09:41.764
Well, I'm glad you liked him.

09:41.784 --> 09:42.947
No, I do think...

09:43.501 --> 09:45.404
I mean, Texas is a very interesting phenomenon.

09:45.424 --> 09:47.387
As you say, it really is love, isn't it?

09:47.407 --> 09:48.007
It is, yeah.

09:48.028 --> 09:50.491
But it's also without a possession.

09:50.591 --> 09:51.452
Are you familiar with the Texas phenomenon?

09:51.472 --> 09:52.133
A little bit, yes.

09:52.153 --> 09:53.575
I could send you a copy of my book.

09:53.716 --> 09:55.518
I would be very glad to have your book.

09:55.538 --> 09:58.242
You'd enjoy it, because you're in it, number one.

09:58.262 --> 09:59.985
I should have thought to bring a copy, I'm sorry.

10:00.105 --> 10:00.546
But go ahead.

10:00.986 --> 10:03.670
No, if you could get someone to post it to me.

10:03.886 --> 10:07.251
I would be even more grateful because I'm going round and round on tour.

10:07.471 --> 10:10.075
If you give me an address, I'll post it to you.

10:10.115 --> 10:10.656
How's that?

10:10.676 --> 10:15.463
That would be even better, but I could get my publishers to post it without causing you angst.

10:15.483 --> 10:19.128
Either that or I'd be happy to do it if you just tell me where to send it.

10:19.609 --> 10:20.290
Right.

10:20.751 --> 10:24.376
Before we forget, we don't have a copy.

10:24.416 --> 10:28.582
We don't have a British edition yet, so I'm running again.

10:28.922 --> 10:29.944
My eyes are terrible.

10:29.964 --> 10:32.728
These computer screens have killed my eyesight, I can tell you.

10:33.367 --> 10:34.448
Do you write on a computer?

10:34.468 --> 10:38.973
No, I write with a pen, which produces the kind of writing I do.

10:39.353 --> 10:46.300
I do my journalism on a computer, but I do it mostly by not looking at it and just thinking it in my head and typing it off the keys.

10:46.360 --> 10:49.904
I don't look at it much when I'm actually doing it.

10:50.524 --> 10:52.546
Do you notice a difference in the writing?

10:53.347 --> 10:53.708
Yes.

10:54.028 --> 10:58.152
Everybody says that computers make them write longer.

10:58.472 --> 10:58.773
True.

10:58.953 --> 11:00.474
They make me write much shorter.

11:00.675 --> 11:00.955
Really?

11:01.656 --> 11:03.137
When I've got a word check,

11:03.286 --> 11:09.814
I find that a thousand word review, I quite often have said everything I want to say in about 750 words.

11:11.897 --> 11:14.801
Whereas if I'm doing it by hand, it will run over.

11:15.101 --> 11:21.590
Well, I count them less accurately, and then it's nice to be able to just push two keys and get an exact count.

11:21.950 --> 11:31.943
And as you pointed out in one of your collections of criticism, I forget which one that was, you know, you are writing differently when you're writing for money at length.

11:32.142 --> 11:37.647
You know, when you're writing, it's an entirely, I mean, I write on deadline every week.

11:38.448 --> 11:39.489
No, it's in art form.

11:39.509 --> 11:44.314
I mean, it's like the sonnet in one sex, you know, it's got to be done precisely.

11:44.354 --> 11:45.275
14 lines.

11:45.295 --> 11:46.296
Yeah, exactly.

11:46.696 --> 11:49.879
And I mean, most reviews are about 14 lines.

11:49.899 --> 11:58.588
And you get, well, it says in that novel, you get to know what kind of vocabulary you can use and what you can't.

11:59.564 --> 12:11.586
There's a lot of young men reviewing in England at the moment who don't seem to realise that you can't quote extensively in a review of a thousand words because it leaves you no time to say anything.

12:11.887 --> 12:12.148
That's right.

12:12.168 --> 12:14.071
But the lazy people know that and do that.

12:14.873 --> 12:16.456
They don't do it out of laziness.

12:16.556 --> 12:19.601
They do it because they've been taught close reading at university.

12:19.762 --> 12:19.902
Mm-hmm.

12:20.185 --> 12:23.228
and they feel they have to demonstrate their point.

12:23.249 --> 12:31.578
And what they do is they pick out a paragraph, which is part of a much larger structure, which, of course, they haven't left themselves space to describe, even if they understood it.

12:31.898 --> 12:34.882
And then they say, look at that silly word in the second line of this paragraph.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.303
How could she use that word?

12:36.824 --> 12:38.326
Or how could he use that word?

12:38.806 --> 12:41.289
And they make themselves look very clever.

12:41.309 --> 12:43.432
But actually, what they're doing doesn't mean very much.

12:44.213 --> 12:48.117
And as a piece of writing, it's always very lopsided because of this silly quote.

12:49.042 --> 12:56.270
Whereas I've learned, you know, in a thousand words you can quote one and a half lines maximum of the thing you're reviewing.

12:57.291 --> 13:04.179
And if you were George Eliot when she was reviewing, you had two columns for you to write, and then you had two or three pages of quotes.

13:04.259 --> 13:04.920
Wonderful.

13:04.940 --> 13:08.103
Which was wonderful, because it meant she could really give an example.

13:08.584 --> 13:11.127
Even today, a thousand words is quite an indulgence.

13:11.307 --> 13:15.792
I mean, I write thousand word pieces, and I have to tell you, the newspapers that take me

13:16.058 --> 13:17.420
Really, it's a big deal.

13:17.440 --> 13:18.081
They give me a lot.

13:18.441 --> 13:21.285
A thousand words is about as big as you can get in a newspaper.

13:21.305 --> 13:23.408
That's why I mentioned it.

13:23.448 --> 13:25.632
And my word counter, I quit at a thousand words.

13:25.992 --> 13:29.878
Or if I run over it, then I edit it down and tighten it up.

13:30.238 --> 13:32.521
I mean, I can do 600 words, too.

13:32.581 --> 13:34.364
I can even do 200 words.

13:35.205 --> 13:37.969
I mean, there, the skill is to say anything at all.

13:38.570 --> 13:39.231
I like the two.

13:39.251 --> 13:41.314
You know, I've written quite a few of these.

13:41.975 --> 13:43.617
This one I'll go back on and talk about.

13:43.637 --> 13:45.660
And I promise not to take up too much of your time.

13:45.826 --> 13:56.383
I have your, I know your biography, I've read articles, so I'm not going to bore you with questions that you've been asked dozens of times, and undoubtedly have answered them the same way, so we won't bore you with that.

13:56.684 --> 14:02.153
I really am interested, however, in getting back to, you know, you gave me a very interesting answer on the corpus.

14:04.016 --> 14:06.700
Do you have a reader in mind when you're writing these books?

14:06.720 --> 14:12.610
Because I know you certainly have a very strong academic background, and I know you bristle at suggestions, rightfully so,

14:13.366 --> 14:21.616
that you're an academic who writes novels for the general readership, and perhaps you could address all of those things, if you might.

14:21.636 --> 14:31.106
Yes, I've never thought of myself as an academic, because, you know, when I was very young, I made a choice about whether to be an academic or whether to be a writer.

14:32.608 --> 14:36.553
And I did decide to be a writer.

14:37.374 --> 14:42.900
And I taught university for 11 years, but that was mostly to earn money to put the children through school.

14:43.403 --> 14:49.549
I used not to have a reader in mind very much.

14:49.569 --> 14:54.515
I mean, I used to sort of say, as a joke, if I was asked, I would say, yes, I write for Henry James.

14:55.636 --> 15:02.863
And he has had a surprisingly large and durable readership of people who are not academics.

15:04.045 --> 15:07.268
I...

15:08.362 --> 15:11.367
I have a New York edition of Henry James, which is a big deal.

15:11.527 --> 15:11.968
Oh, yeah.

15:11.988 --> 15:12.669
It's the 1922.

15:12.829 --> 15:14.371
Oh, it was wonderful, yeah.

15:14.391 --> 15:18.898
Where he went in and he wrote his prefaces and he started tinkering with the works themselves.

15:18.999 --> 15:22.804
I've got one or two of that edition, but not a run of it.

15:22.845 --> 15:23.966
I would love to have a run of it.

15:24.647 --> 15:27.652
Anyway, I used to think I was writing for him.

15:27.672 --> 15:33.441
You know, I used to think he would understand what I was trying to do, put it that way.

15:33.910 --> 15:38.656
And now I do know that I have a lot of readers of very many different kinds.

15:39.357 --> 15:54.157
This makes you actually feel quite comfortable with yourself because if you can write something as historical and as, in many ways, intellectual as possession and become a bestseller, you can presumably do anything.

15:55.139 --> 15:57.201
Did that shock you, surprise you?

15:57.221 --> 15:59.985
I thought it would sell quite well.

16:01.012 --> 16:06.702
I would have guessed it would have sold sort of 25,000 or so in the hardback.

16:06.762 --> 16:10.509
And in fact, it got itself up to 120,000, which is a big difference.

16:11.010 --> 16:16.960
But 25,000 is quite a lot for a... I knew it was a sort of good story that people would enjoy.

16:17.882 --> 16:22.370
And I got terribly upset when all the publishers tried to take all the things out.

16:24.294 --> 16:25.095
But...

16:26.510 --> 16:36.444
And, I mean, writing this one was quite good, because I've done so many readings in so many countries, and people kept saying, what's happened to Frederica, what will happen to Frederica, why haven't you finished it?

16:36.765 --> 16:39.128
Because I knew it had its readers who were waiting for it.

16:40.610 --> 16:46.118
And, um... Do you have a little top on your... Probably not, because I've made it too strong.

16:47.560 --> 16:51.005
No, no, I need to be able to put a little more milk in it, and then it'll be fine.

16:55.051 --> 16:55.251
Yes, um...

16:57.509 --> 16:58.931
It's a nice hotel, by the way.

16:58.951 --> 17:01.835
It does seem to be, yes, and it has good bread.

17:01.895 --> 17:04.218
I've been through a few hotels that the bread was black.

17:04.399 --> 17:06.301
I have very few offices stay here.

17:06.642 --> 17:09.526
I've been interviewing the office for close to 20 years, by the way.

17:10.848 --> 17:13.672
So I know I've been to every hotel, I think, in the northeast.

17:14.573 --> 17:18.418
Well, they've very kindly picked all my hotels so that I can go swimming.

17:18.699 --> 17:19.260
Oh, wonderful.

17:19.280 --> 17:22.344
And then, of course, they scheduled it so that I actually can't go swimming.

17:22.604 --> 17:23.145
Oh.

17:23.648 --> 17:31.356
Because the moment I come in, I have interviews, and then I go on until about 11 at night, when even if the swimming pool were open, I somehow can't.

17:31.376 --> 17:34.138
Maybe tomorrow morning, you'll be here tonight?

17:34.459 --> 17:41.706
Yes, I've got a very great friend in Cambridge, who I hope to manage to see.

17:41.746 --> 17:51.816
She's my very best friend, and possession is dedicated to her, and she's a distinguished professor of English who is on a year's sabbatical here.

17:52.083 --> 17:52.724
And who is she?

17:53.005 --> 17:56.911
Her name is Isabel Armstrong from Henry James Inn.

17:56.991 --> 18:00.718
And she's a great Victorian scholar.

18:01.459 --> 18:15.042
When she came over here to write a book on, she's writing an interesting book about glass and the idea of glass and the literary idea of glass, but also the substance itself and the production of glass.

18:15.282 --> 18:18.107
Well, have you ever been to the faculty club at Harvard?

18:18.813 --> 18:20.816
That's the site of where the Jameses lived.

18:20.836 --> 18:24.201
Yes, not since 1958, which is a long time ago.

18:24.321 --> 18:31.552
But that's, I was just there recently, and there's a sign out there, this is where, you know, James Senior had his home.

18:31.672 --> 18:35.578
I must be one of the few people that has really read the work of James Senior.

18:35.598 --> 18:36.720
It was interesting.

18:38.582 --> 18:38.843
Senior?

18:38.863 --> 18:38.983
Wow.

18:39.263 --> 18:43.429
Well, I used to teach Henry James, I mean, after I decided.

18:43.449 --> 18:45.833
And I used to do a series of lectures on...

18:46.201 --> 18:56.194
Henry James Senior and William James and Henry James and Henry James Senior's Swedenborgianism and whether or not that fitted onto the works of James Junior.

18:56.595 --> 18:58.037
And I'm pretty sure it did.

18:58.858 --> 19:07.169
And there was a book that came out when I was an undergraduate that said, you know, if you read James Senior, you see all sorts of things in James Junior.

19:08.491 --> 19:11.134
And I sat down and read The Secret of Swedenborg.

19:11.274 --> 19:11.835
And is it true?

19:12.516 --> 19:14.098
Oh yes, you definitely do.

19:14.348 --> 19:15.890
which is extremely interesting.

19:15.930 --> 19:20.936
You see all sorts of new ways of looking at him and new angles to look at him from.

19:21.256 --> 19:25.641
And he fits much more into this whole... The moment I get off myself, I get interested in things.

19:26.002 --> 19:32.589
He fits much more into this whole 19th century spiritual, religious pattern with Henry James, Jr.

19:33.090 --> 19:35.653
than you would ever have thought if you don't read Henry James, Sr.

19:36.434 --> 19:39.377
You know there's a new biography in progress of William James.

19:39.897 --> 19:41.800
Oh, who's doing that?

19:42.000 --> 19:59.446
Justin Kaplan was, I'm pointing to Cambridge across the river, but he stopped because somebody else started, and I'll remember it before we're done, but quite a notable biographer, and to the point that now Justin is no longer doing women, a major American biographer.

19:59.466 --> 20:00.488
In any case,

20:00.704 --> 20:19.984
You don't mind my asking a few questions that are totally unrelated to, I am interested in, I'm writing a new book now, and I'm really interested in how extensively the reading of authors influences their writing, and I know that you are quite a reader, a voracious reader, and perhaps even a bibliophile, I don't know if that, do you collect books, by the way?

20:20.885 --> 20:25.750
I own a large number of books, but I only collect them for the contents, you know, they're never the

20:25.966 --> 20:28.088
occur to me to go out and look for a first edition.

20:28.108 --> 20:29.750
I just like what's in there.

20:29.770 --> 20:33.974
But when you say a large number, what would a large number be?

20:36.216 --> 20:38.879
I should think about, I should guess 12,000.

20:38.959 --> 20:40.881
That's quite a good size.

20:41.061 --> 20:55.416
I mean, the house is full of books, and it was 3,000 about, the 3,000 were insured in about 1960-something, and I've been buying them at great speed, I've

20:55.868 --> 21:05.442
Does your reading, would you say, I mean, it seems like a silly question, but I'm wondering if you can see in your own work the influence of the books that you read?

21:05.642 --> 21:06.103
Oh, yes.

21:06.263 --> 21:11.971
I feel that, I mean, I feel that the great writers of the past are my ancestors, as it were.

21:11.991 --> 21:13.353
You can always learn something.

21:14.475 --> 21:20.804
And also, I think, you know, books are as real to me as people.

21:22.466 --> 21:23.007
I mean,

21:24.252 --> 21:26.734
you get the sort of sense of the shape of a book.

21:28.436 --> 21:37.704
I can't imagine, you know, occasionally you go into a house where there isn't a book.

21:39.185 --> 21:47.493
My mother-in-law had about eight books, and most of those were books of poetry, and she read them and re-read them with great passion.

21:48.254 --> 21:53.078
But how she could stop there and have just eight, you know, she had one little bookcase,

21:53.463 --> 21:55.846
with an arch over the top, and it had these row of books.

21:56.787 --> 22:03.136
And there were two, three 1930s novels and about half a dozen good books of poetry and a gardening book, and that was it.

22:03.837 --> 22:05.219
I just can't imagine that.

22:05.239 --> 22:08.683
You know, I can't... I feel that that isn't quite a lie.

22:09.304 --> 22:12.048
Do you have books that you haven't read in your home?

22:12.128 --> 22:13.470
I used not, and now I do.

22:13.490 --> 22:17.295
I've got quite a lot of books that I haven't read, and these are of two kinds.

22:17.375 --> 22:18.356
Well, three kinds, really.

22:18.376 --> 22:19.858
They're the ones I've bought

22:20.783 --> 22:24.948
because I know I need them for my research, and I haven't yet got round to reading them.

22:25.770 --> 22:30.796
And there are the ones I've bought, because that looks quite interesting, and I haven't got round to reading those as well.

22:32.999 --> 22:39.748
And then there are the ones that people send me, and in my position you get sent hundreds of books.

22:40.509 --> 22:44.414
And some of them come from the author saying, please will you write something on the back of my book.

22:45.556 --> 22:46.857
And some of them come from the publisher.

22:46.877 --> 22:50.402
I mean, you know, one came from my own publisher not long ago saying we're publishing this.

22:51.175 --> 22:58.826
groundbreaking new biography of Henry James, which we really think, you know, we think so, would you care to write something?

22:59.387 --> 23:07.999
And the only way I can deal with all this is to write back to absolutely every single one, even my best friend, and say, no, I will not write anything on the back of anybody's book, ever.

23:08.680 --> 23:12.846
And I say, if I write a review of your book, then obviously you can quote my review, but

23:13.585 --> 23:14.887
But that's public, you know.

23:14.967 --> 23:17.931
I don't like the private backstretching.

23:17.951 --> 23:23.299
And also, the only way I can cope with the people is to make it quite clear to all of them that I won't even consider it.

23:23.680 --> 23:25.883
Which is the way to do it.

23:25.923 --> 23:27.145
Yeah, it's quite worrying.

23:27.706 --> 23:29.288
My book had no blurbs.

23:29.489 --> 23:34.756
We had some nice quotes, which we didn't use, because we had such a dramatically beautiful dust jacket.

23:34.776 --> 23:35.037
Oh, yes.

23:35.097 --> 23:37.020
The Durer engraving of the book pool.

23:37.661 --> 23:38.562
Oh, yes.

23:38.642 --> 23:39.964
Lovely, lovely.

23:40.653 --> 23:42.256
And it was so wonderful.

23:42.677 --> 23:44.560
And my book has gone into its fifth frame.

23:44.580 --> 23:45.722
It's up to 60,000 books.

23:46.403 --> 23:50.390
Well, it's on the sort of subject that... It's about this wit, this cup, too.

23:50.410 --> 23:50.931
That's good, yeah.

23:51.392 --> 23:54.698
It's on a subject that will always... I mean, you will always have readers.

23:54.758 --> 23:55.660
I think you'll like it.

23:55.780 --> 23:58.705
I'll send it to you when I get back home.

23:59.647 --> 24:04.956
Briefly, to get back to Possession, was that a liberating book for you in that?

24:05.695 --> 24:08.259
I mean, it's been called the breakthrough book, I don't know.

24:08.279 --> 24:10.783
Yeah, well, I mean, in a way, it was a breakthrough book.

24:10.903 --> 24:17.654
Yes, it was a liberating book, partly because it was actually quite easy to write, although it looks very complicated.

24:18.695 --> 24:26.647
And partly because everybody liked it so much, and almost nobody dislikes it, as far as I can see, which ought to make one a bit suspicious of it.

24:27.990 --> 24:33.458
Are you fearful of so much public...

24:33.657 --> 24:34.819
approbation, you know?

24:34.839 --> 24:39.986
Well, what I feel is, which is right, of course, is that at the moment there's that much public approbation.

24:40.006 --> 24:45.614
The sort of cut-and-thrust young journalists will decide that you need taking down a couple or two.

24:46.415 --> 24:48.799
They will decide you need to be cut down to size.

24:49.680 --> 24:52.384
And they don't ask you what you felt about all that.

24:52.404 --> 24:55.449
I mean, what I felt about it all on the whole was I'd better get on with my work.

24:55.549 --> 24:58.052
I have this book and that book that I want to write.

24:58.213 --> 25:00.576
I'm not very good at being famous and

25:01.433 --> 25:04.497
On the whole, I would rather be at home writing a book than on a book tour.

25:05.478 --> 25:14.129
But they think, somehow, that because you have been well-received, you must now be mocked.

25:14.590 --> 25:21.299
This is very tedious, and I've seen it happen to other people so much that I know it isn't, you know, it's not personal.

25:21.319 --> 25:26.125
But it's, nevertheless, they find something personal to be hurtful about, because you've got yourself in the firing line.

25:27.166 --> 25:28.588
Whereas...

25:30.155 --> 25:33.301
But it is nice having the money, apart from anything else.

25:33.321 --> 25:34.443
Indeed.

25:34.463 --> 25:35.384
And that is liberating.

25:35.424 --> 25:37.909
Yeah, it is.

25:37.929 --> 25:46.264
I have to say, my book, which earned out its advance in two days, such a small, tiny advance, and it really does help when you're negotiating the next book, doesn't it?

25:46.284 --> 25:47.887
It really does help, doesn't it, yeah.

25:48.688 --> 25:51.353
And actually, I've got a two-book contract, which is even better.

25:52.750 --> 25:54.453
What are you going to do after this?

25:55.033 --> 26:00.842
I'm going to continue writing about books and book culture and libraries, books of the future.

26:01.243 --> 26:02.324
I'm not done.

26:02.384 --> 26:03.666
I'm just fascinated with books.

26:03.787 --> 26:09.856
I'm going to spend a considerable amount of time in Europe, I think, to do some European stories.

26:10.236 --> 26:11.779
We'll see.

26:11.819 --> 26:12.700
I mean, it's just beginning.

26:12.740 --> 26:13.401
I've just started.

26:13.421 --> 26:15.023
You never know the beauty of what I do.

26:15.064 --> 26:16.606
You write a history of publishing.

26:16.646 --> 26:17.707
That would be interesting.

26:18.068 --> 26:18.509
It would be.

26:19.250 --> 26:20.732
Maybe that'll be the next one.

26:20.948 --> 26:30.282
I don't want to take up too much of your time, and I know that you're worried as a traveling, but I just want to do less, and I've stayed away from, that's my job, to read the book.

26:30.302 --> 26:31.203
We've talked about a few things.

26:31.744 --> 26:32.685
We talked about the 60s.

26:32.765 --> 26:37.812
Is the 60s a fascinating generation, a decade for you?

26:39.375 --> 26:40.817
Not more than any other.

26:40.837 --> 26:41.738
Certainly is in this country.

26:41.778 --> 26:48.508
The 60s is a... Well, it's developed this kind of cult status, and I've taught two generations of students for whom

26:48.725 --> 26:54.953
The 60s was a sort of wonderful image of freedom and bliss and daring.

26:56.134 --> 26:58.517
It didn't feel quite like that when you were living, Stuart.

26:58.537 --> 27:00.680
It didn't feel that different from any other time.

27:00.720 --> 27:01.701
I quite agree.

27:01.781 --> 27:05.306
That's my generation, too.

27:05.326 --> 27:06.968
I think it's partly just a myth.

27:07.869 --> 27:11.273
Well, somebody said there were about a thousand people.

27:11.658 --> 27:13.060
who were the Sixth Years.

27:13.801 --> 27:19.029
And all of them have written their reminiscences saying that everybody was doing what they were doing.

27:19.069 --> 27:22.374
And actually, there were about, I think about a thousand is about right.

27:22.394 --> 27:24.637
That's not a bad idea for a monograph or even a book, is it?

27:24.697 --> 27:25.178
Exactly.

27:25.198 --> 27:35.533
I mean, I think you could... Determining which... Well, that is a terrific idea for me, isn't it?

27:35.553 --> 27:39.218
Yes, and you could get a really top-class photographer to take pictures of them all.

27:39.679 --> 27:40.500
Have you thought of this?

27:40.784 --> 27:46.811
It's not my sort of thing, I just want to get on with my novels, but it's a nice idea.

27:46.951 --> 27:59.206
I'm trying to think who it was that said it, because if it was, for instance, what's his name, Neville, the one who was tried for Oz, he probably has thought of it and is probably doing it himself.

28:01.028 --> 28:03.731
Did Timothy Leary die?

28:03.831 --> 28:05.273
He died today.

28:07.193 --> 28:08.314
I've been thinking about him.

28:08.334 --> 28:12.660
I mean, partly because I've been talking to journalists and bookshop people about the six days.

28:12.680 --> 28:13.901
Either last night or this morning.

28:13.921 --> 28:15.203
I just put it on the news driving in.

28:15.223 --> 28:20.349
Yes, because I saw that his death, as it were, he was conducting his death in public on the television.

28:20.369 --> 28:22.252
And that he was on the internet and all this.

28:22.272 --> 28:24.735
What do you feel about books in the future?

28:25.976 --> 28:26.517
Do you have a sense?

28:27.698 --> 28:30.061
I have two or three contradictory senses.

28:31.964 --> 28:33.986
This is of great interest to me, by the way.

28:34.006 --> 28:36.289
In fact, it'll probably be quoted in my next book.

28:36.961 --> 28:45.211
I tell you, if you haven't already heard or seen it, George Steiner has been giving a brilliant series of lectures on books of the future.

28:46.052 --> 28:46.192
Really?

28:46.212 --> 28:48.956
He gave a brilliant one I heard in Cambridge last summer.

28:49.957 --> 29:01.111
And he has a son who teaches, I think this is right, he said he had a son who taught disadvantaged children somewhere in North Carolina, I think he said, he may have said South Carolina.

29:01.992 --> 29:06.377
And he goes there with holograms and CD-ROMs.

29:06.948 --> 29:15.858
And he could offer them the whole of the Library of Congress and the whole of the British Library on these CD-ROMs, although these kids haven't the money to buy a book.

29:15.878 --> 29:17.140
And he said that this is good.

29:17.180 --> 29:25.129
And then he has a daughter who is an anthropologist or some sort of something, or a sinologist, I forget, but she's somewhere in Harvard or Yale.

29:25.570 --> 29:32.718
And she endlessly communicates her papers by sticking them into the internet and immediately getting back comments on email.

29:32.738 --> 29:35.301
And she's connected into the major people in her

29:35.602 --> 29:46.953
Now, this obviously is going to make the physical book less necessary, but I still think there will be physical books, because I think people need to carry them about in their pocket and read them in airplanes.

29:47.613 --> 29:49.635
I think for literature, the book lives.

29:50.256 --> 30:03.388
I think for literature... But I think for research and for precisely the kinds of things you're describing right now, these new devices are... The thing is, of course, that any of those things can be made into a book if you happen to want it to.

30:03.849 --> 30:05.170
If you talk to scientists,

30:05.453 --> 30:11.261
They say there is no reason to publish in book form most scientific papers.

30:11.381 --> 30:18.930
It is enough that there should be an internet register or a CD-ROM register of all the titles and the crises.

30:19.691 --> 30:23.997
And in a way, you know... This does reflect the body of opinion now, is that right?

30:24.017 --> 30:25.759
Well, it does of the scientists, I think.

30:25.799 --> 30:30.145
I think they think that any scientist can then, as it were,

30:30.817 --> 30:34.821
clock into there, and can draw out any paper they want to read.

30:34.841 --> 30:37.004
So the paper can be put down on a computer and put in.

30:37.044 --> 30:39.306
And it need never be printed out in a book.

30:39.326 --> 30:41.649
There's a brand new library just opened in New York.

30:41.689 --> 30:43.290
It's a division of the New York Public Library.

30:43.330 --> 30:47.695
It's called Sybil, science, industry, business, whatever.

30:47.715 --> 30:48.836
So it is all technical.

30:48.856 --> 30:52.260
$100 million, and there are just books there as decorations.

30:52.320 --> 30:54.222
It really is all to log in.

30:54.282 --> 30:56.925
Thank you.

30:58.610 --> 31:07.906
And there's, I'm also told, I'll be going out there, there's a brand new college just established in California, in Monterey, by the state of California, that was built without a library.

31:08.426 --> 31:12.734
There actually is not a building there to hold books, which I find reprehensible.

31:12.754 --> 31:15.919
Well, I find that very disturbing and distressing, yes.

31:16.300 --> 31:18.744
But it is a very technical kind of an institution.

31:19.084 --> 31:23.672
But there are buildings, there are libraries in California if you wanted to go and find one.

31:24.209 --> 31:25.991
not as extraordinary as Texas.

31:26.011 --> 31:26.471
Really.

31:26.712 --> 31:48.994
Let me tell you also that when I was doing my master's thesis back in the 60s, it was on the Bobby Baker case, and I remember using the Profumo scandal as a reference, you know, as a British counterpart to...the Baker case wasn't nearly as sexy as the Profumo scandal, but you do draw on that here.

31:49.014 --> 31:53.018
And of course, tell me briefly about the Subsidia case and why that was

31:53.285 --> 31:57.589
necessary for you, particularly in the concept of this book.

31:57.609 --> 31:58.029
Thank you.

31:59.450 --> 32:00.571
My obscenity case.

32:01.152 --> 32:06.136
Is this tea or coffee?

32:06.156 --> 32:06.296
Coffee.

32:06.316 --> 32:07.978
It looked a different colour, that was all.

32:12.342 --> 32:14.864
It's partly because there were a lot of obscenity cases.

32:15.645 --> 32:22.971
It's a book that's essentially about the relationship of language to things and language to life and the way it gets torn apart and

32:23.356 --> 32:30.847
I remember in the 60s I knew a lot of people who gave evidence both in the Lady Chatterley trial and in the trial of last exit to Brooklyn.

32:31.688 --> 32:38.918
And they were describing to them a sense they had that the whole of the language they wanted to use was being distorted by the legal process.

32:38.958 --> 32:41.903
They couldn't say what they would have liked to say.

32:42.423 --> 32:43.725
They were having to say something else.

32:43.745 --> 32:46.529
The whole process was driving them to talk in a different way.

32:47.050 --> 32:48.392
I got quite interested in that.

32:49.534 --> 32:50.595
And then...

32:52.988 --> 33:03.619
And I wanted to contrast that sort of public distortion with the private distortion of a divorce which in those days had to be adversarial.

33:03.639 --> 33:06.842
And I was interested in courtroom narratives.

33:06.922 --> 33:11.567
I mean, just as Possession is interested in detective stories and romantic love stories.

33:12.047 --> 33:16.552
This is interested in the nature of the courtroom narrative and how it changes the people.

33:17.393 --> 33:21.477
So, for all those reasons it got in.

33:23.093 --> 33:32.324
And then there is a place where it all comes together in the Moore's murders because there was a lot of argument about whether we should or shouldn't censor the Marquis de Sade.

33:34.126 --> 33:44.199
And the last exit case was lost because the jury brought a verdict against last exit in Brooklyn.

33:44.860 --> 33:50.907
And this was overturned on appeal because I think all the lawyers felt

33:51.173 --> 33:57.241
that on the whole the book ought to be published, even the ones who were prosecuting, and so the judge found various reasons.

33:58.563 --> 34:00.265
And last exit went through.

34:01.366 --> 34:06.853
But at exactly that point, sort of in 1967, the Moores murderers were tried.

34:07.755 --> 34:18.008
And when you looked at Brady's library, he had quite an extensive library of the Marquis de Sade and the Nuremberg trials and various other posts about torture.

34:18.123 --> 34:19.645
And that really frightened people.

34:19.725 --> 34:29.877
It produced a kind of wash of feeling about how perhaps these things were dangerous when we had just thought that we were being immensely liberal and free and we could publish everything.

34:30.377 --> 34:32.920
Well, there's a very interesting resonance today, the Unabomber.

34:33.862 --> 34:39.628
They're really trying to look at what he read and they're trying to find the books that he might have taken out of this university in Montana.

34:40.209 --> 34:42.412
And this fascinates me.

34:42.432 --> 34:43.653
Well, it fascinates me.

34:43.673 --> 34:46.136
I mean, the libraries of murderers actually are fascinating.

34:46.156 --> 34:47.758
The libraries of almost anybody, of course, is...

34:48.143 --> 34:50.806
That might be a pretty good chapter for me, actually.

34:50.826 --> 34:52.889
It might, if you know any more murderers.

34:53.530 --> 34:56.113
But Brady's library is completely recorded.

34:56.794 --> 34:56.954
Really?

34:57.054 --> 34:57.415
Yes.

34:57.735 --> 34:59.978
Has it been written up anywhere?

34:59.998 --> 35:03.483
No, but there is a sort of, you have to get a hold of it a second.

35:03.503 --> 35:10.612
There is an ancient Penguin transcript of the trial, not a complete transcript, but written at the time of the trial.

35:10.712 --> 35:11.954
I'll look at that at Harvard.

35:11.974 --> 35:12.795
I'm sure you can.

35:12.855 --> 35:16.720
And they list the books that he was found to have.

35:17.060 --> 35:17.661
Well, that's great.

35:17.911 --> 35:18.812
which is very interesting.

35:18.832 --> 35:23.578
I'm making a research trip to Wyden next week, so that'll be... I'm not going to take up too much of your time.

35:23.698 --> 35:28.444
I love what you write, and I'm a fan, and I wonder would you kindly inscribe a couple of books for me?

35:28.464 --> 35:28.864
Certainly I will.

35:29.085 --> 35:35.172
I'll give you my... Very briefly, writing... Were you surprised by the American reaction to possession after your books?

35:35.833 --> 35:38.036
Did you expect to give this kind of an American readership?

35:38.817 --> 35:40.258
No, I don't think I did.

35:40.278 --> 35:44.003
I always felt that my earlier books...

35:44.422 --> 35:47.707
If they had gone into paperback, the Americans would have liked.

35:48.629 --> 36:06.177
And in fact, when they did go into paperback, the Americans did like them, because one of the good results of possession was that still life then went into paperback and sat on the New York Times paperback bestseller list for quite a long time, which, you know, was unexpected, and nobody did bother to put it into print.

36:06.629 --> 36:13.175
And I think, you know, the thing about possession appealing to the Americans that most pleased me was that they do seem to like all the others.

36:13.235 --> 36:16.458
The others are all now in print, and they seem to be staying in print.

36:16.478 --> 36:19.842
And do you hear from them, or is it just the sales figures that lead you to believe this?

36:19.862 --> 36:21.023
Do you hear from the readers at all?

36:21.043 --> 36:23.725
Oh, I hear from the readers a great deal, and I very much enjoy it.

36:24.366 --> 36:31.773
I sat next to a lady on the airplane coming here, and she said she had once written a letter to an author, but he hadn't answered.

36:32.173 --> 36:33.835
And so I explained that, you know, I get

36:34.118 --> 37:00.396
a lot of letters and if I'm not in a terrible mess I answer them politely and carefully every now and then you just get too many and you're too much in a rush and you're trying to finish a book and you always have to reply to the bank manager whether you want to or not so these letters are the cream really but it has made a great difference having all these American readers and I love you know I love talking to them in the bookshops because

37:01.203 --> 37:04.510
They do take the book slightly differently from the English.

37:04.530 --> 37:05.852
That was my next question, yeah.

37:05.872 --> 37:07.917
So they do respond just a bit differently.

37:07.937 --> 37:12.345
Yes, they do, and they give you a new, you know, they give you yourself a new word.

37:12.566 --> 37:15.111
Some of it, a lot of the response is the same.

37:15.817 --> 37:20.143
Reader response is one of the vital signs, though, isn't it, of the writing life?

37:20.283 --> 37:25.631
I mean, you find that you're not writing into a vacuum, and it's not just reviewers who are the arbiters.

37:25.651 --> 37:32.280
Yes, reviewers in many ways bear no relation to readers, but it takes a few years of being reviewed for you to understand this.

37:33.061 --> 37:35.304
You know, reviewers have their own agenda.

37:35.464 --> 37:36.646
They have their own knowledge.

37:37.707 --> 37:44.777
And they already, they come, I think, quite often with preconceptions about what it's going to be and what they're going to say.

37:45.213 --> 37:47.777
which the book doesn't always change, even if it should have done.

37:47.817 --> 37:53.205
But readers come all innocent and open, and if they don't like your book, they just stop reading it.

37:54.147 --> 37:57.412
And if they do like it, then they respond with generosity.

37:57.592 --> 37:58.814
It's a wonderful quote.

37:58.914 --> 38:00.517
And it's much the best thing, really.

38:01.358 --> 38:02.019
Let's quit on that.

38:02.039 --> 38:03.441
That's a wonderful quote.
