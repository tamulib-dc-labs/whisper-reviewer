00:03.777 --> 00:13.473
My English is Macaronico.

00:14.575 --> 00:26.716
My English is spaghetti English.

00:27.738 --> 00:29.160
How old is this building, Father?

00:29.849 --> 00:34.599
So all this lived by the founder from the 17 and 20.

00:34.980 --> 00:38.067
Because we came on this island in the 17 and 17.

00:39.229 --> 00:44.481
And when the founder came here, he found only the church and a little building in the beginning of the monastery.

00:44.882 --> 00:49.552
So all these, all the monasteries, the cloister, the monastery, all these made by Nechitar, by a founder.

00:49.913 --> 00:50.153
Yes.

00:50.369 --> 00:52.151
And what church was here before?

00:52.711 --> 00:55.113
The church is after we can see the church.

00:55.133 --> 00:56.915
But what was here before he came here?

00:57.556 --> 00:59.918
Before he was here in Lepra Colony.

01:00.558 --> 01:00.638
Ah.

01:01.980 --> 01:02.240
Lepra Colony.

01:02.260 --> 01:02.340
Yes.

01:02.360 --> 01:04.522
For this he was giving generosity to our founders.

01:04.922 --> 01:10.207
The Republic of Venice was giving generosity to our founders because it was in Lepra Colony.

01:11.028 --> 01:11.889
Nobody wished to live here.

01:11.929 --> 01:12.529
Nobody.

01:15.592 --> 01:17.794
But this is made by the founders.

01:18.213 --> 01:23.200
But from the 1180, we have the construction of the church.

01:23.961 --> 01:28.448
The church is built in 1180 by Benedictines in the Roman Empire.

01:28.468 --> 01:30.110
1180?

01:30.130 --> 01:30.430
1180.

01:30.491 --> 01:30.691
Yeah.

01:31.212 --> 01:38.582
And in the 1300, we had the first hospital for the lepros.

01:38.602 --> 01:39.443
Yeah.

01:39.463 --> 01:41.626
And for this, we have the name of Salaam on the island.

01:42.207 --> 01:43.169
Salaam.

01:45.833 --> 01:47.054
Yes.

01:47.455 --> 01:47.595
Salaam.

01:47.643 --> 02:02.807
Okay, so Father, this building is one of the original buildings here?

02:03.208 --> 02:06.012
It's the only building of the founders.

02:06.352 --> 02:08.516
This is very old, I can see.

02:08.596 --> 02:11.801
Yes, it's from 1700.

02:11.861 --> 02:14.325
This path is 1740.

02:14.457 --> 02:16.560
And where do these paintings come from?

02:17.442 --> 02:31.124
Italian painters, these two are Palma de Young, Palma de Giovanni, Langezzi, Vassilassi, and this is from the school of the Tiepolo, the famous Tiepolo, from the school.

02:32.286 --> 02:33.788
But it's a fresco.

02:33.808 --> 02:34.229
Yes.

02:34.249 --> 02:35.671
It's made for us.

02:35.691 --> 02:36.653
Oh, it's made for you.

02:36.853 --> 02:38.035
For the monastery.

02:39.044 --> 02:46.231
So this monastery is very important in preserving the Armenian culture, isn't it?

02:46.251 --> 02:46.431
Yes.

02:46.451 --> 02:50.215
It's one of the most important centers for Armenian culture.

02:51.456 --> 02:52.157
This is beautiful.

02:52.457 --> 02:52.897
Yes, go ahead.

02:57.102 --> 03:03.047
You're saying this is the most important... This is the most important... Another one.

03:03.067 --> 03:03.348
Go ahead.

03:03.468 --> 03:06.891
The most important center for Armenian culture here.

03:07.850 --> 03:15.208
And the reason is because... Because our founder, when he came here, he brought with him also the Amina culture here.

03:15.950 --> 03:20.982
Because we are founded for the diffusion of Amina culture, for Amina people.

03:21.637 --> 03:25.861
And this came at a time when the Armenian people were being forced out of their homeland.

03:25.881 --> 03:33.449
No, no, here is only the monastery, only the founder with his monks who came here, not Armenian people.

03:33.649 --> 03:36.032
I understand, but they brought the culture here.

03:36.172 --> 03:38.274
Yes, yes, yes, the culture.

03:38.534 --> 03:39.575
Yes, that's what I want.

03:39.596 --> 03:45.842
The culture, and for this we had many important additions on Armenian culture.

03:46.463 --> 03:48.825
We had also a building house here.

03:49.582 --> 03:50.183
A which house?

03:50.343 --> 03:50.744
Printing.

03:50.904 --> 03:51.304
Printing house.

03:51.324 --> 03:51.605
Oh, yes.

03:51.765 --> 03:52.686
Is it still... Printing house.

03:53.187 --> 03:54.128
You still have the printing?

03:54.148 --> 03:55.169
No, no, no, no.

03:55.209 --> 03:56.952
We are the only editing house.

03:58.213 --> 03:59.875
We are editing house, yes.

03:59.895 --> 04:00.496
From the 1715.

04:02.018 --> 04:06.244
We start from the 1715 as editing house.

04:07.125 --> 04:10.089
And now we continue all these other activities.

04:10.529 --> 04:11.551
So you work with books?

04:11.651 --> 04:12.552
Yes, yes, yes.

04:12.572 --> 04:15.476
So you work with the printed work, which is very important.

04:15.636 --> 04:18.019
For this we have now the computers for the...

04:19.400 --> 04:20.201
Of course, yeah.

04:20.862 --> 04:21.843
So you're going to show us that?

04:23.545 --> 04:27.089
No!

04:27.109 --> 04:27.450
Go ahead, please.

04:29.272 --> 04:32.376
This library we have.

04:32.396 --> 04:36.261
Here we have more than 100,000 books.

04:36.281 --> 04:37.843
100,000 books?

04:38.343 --> 04:38.624
Yes.

04:38.644 --> 04:39.505
More.

04:39.525 --> 04:39.965
More than?

04:40.866 --> 04:42.669
In this monastery.

04:43.990 --> 04:45.612
Oh, look at this, Connie.

04:47.474 --> 04:47.955
Ah.

04:48.644 --> 05:11.174
This is unbelievable.

05:11.214 --> 05:13.517
And this is part of the library here?

05:13.678 --> 05:18.364
The official library made by the founder, Maghita.

05:19.373 --> 05:22.798
All the books here are in European languages.

05:22.818 --> 05:26.704
Because for the Amnian books, we have another part reserved for the fathers.

05:26.924 --> 05:27.124
Yes.

05:27.565 --> 05:30.089
Not here, another one.

05:30.109 --> 05:32.132
But here you have only European books.

05:32.913 --> 05:33.374
Okay.

05:33.394 --> 05:35.617
Occidental languages.

05:35.637 --> 05:37.159
And this room is how old here?

05:37.359 --> 05:39.983
It's also from the period of the founder.

05:40.003 --> 05:43.288
The founder who made this from the

05:43.572 --> 05:44.072
1740.

05:45.193 --> 05:47.555
And these you say are mostly European books.

05:47.976 --> 05:50.458
History of Byzantium is there, I can see.

05:50.498 --> 05:51.279
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:51.299 --> 05:52.980
No, you have all the culture here.

05:53.000 --> 05:53.240
Yes.

05:53.461 --> 05:56.984
It's not only religious.

05:57.004 --> 05:57.784
No.

05:57.804 --> 05:57.945
No.

05:57.965 --> 05:58.965
Books that were brought originally.

05:59.146 --> 06:00.187
Yes.

06:00.607 --> 06:01.868
About all cultural.

06:02.469 --> 06:04.230
This is an Indian papyrus.

06:05.371 --> 06:05.872
Oh, papyrus.

06:05.912 --> 06:07.313
Papyrus, yeah.

06:07.773 --> 06:09.194
This is an Indian papyrus.

06:09.455 --> 06:10.596
Indian papyrus, yeah.

06:10.616 --> 06:10.696
Yes.

06:10.716 --> 06:11.637
Oh, wow.

06:11.657 --> 06:12.237
That's amazing.

06:12.517 --> 06:13.258
This is beautiful.

06:14.015 --> 06:18.660
on the gold field and on the palm.

06:19.821 --> 06:23.445
And the form of the book is in accordion form.

06:23.485 --> 06:24.085
How old is it?

06:25.006 --> 06:26.127
It isn't old.

06:26.948 --> 06:28.230
I think it's from the 1900s.

06:28.250 --> 06:30.852
1900.

06:34.756 --> 06:37.519
It's a papyrus.

06:40.562 --> 06:41.203
Yes.

06:41.555 --> 06:47.843
And these letters are Armenian letters, but for the others, there are also numbers.

06:49.184 --> 06:52.789
We use that number also.

06:52.809 --> 06:54.591
Yeah, because we have 36 letters.

06:56.012 --> 07:01.059
Yes, in Armenian.

07:01.079 --> 07:01.459
More too.

07:01.539 --> 07:05.964
We have also two others who are in the middle age.

07:05.984 --> 07:06.465
So, 38.

07:06.698 --> 07:11.443
And all the books in here relate to the history of the world, or the history of our Armenian people?

07:11.943 --> 07:12.544
No.

07:12.624 --> 07:13.585
Is this possible?

07:13.605 --> 07:13.665
No.

07:13.966 --> 07:15.167
It's interesting.

07:15.287 --> 07:15.667
OK.

07:16.548 --> 07:20.873
Well, I'm going to explore the book about the Armenian culture.

07:21.093 --> 07:22.294
We have been an artist.

07:22.374 --> 07:24.777
And that's really what we're interested in seeing, too.

07:24.837 --> 07:25.097
For us.

07:25.297 --> 07:25.818
Yes.

07:25.838 --> 07:28.160
But we cannot see because it's a part of that of the father.

07:28.461 --> 07:29.362
I'll show you.

07:29.382 --> 07:29.502
OK.

07:29.522 --> 07:31.924
OK.

07:33.165 --> 07:33.246
Why?

07:33.266 --> 07:33.426
Here?

07:34.387 --> 07:34.647
OK.

07:34.846 --> 07:36.829
Now I'll show you the literature of the menacee.

07:37.110 --> 07:38.372
Oh, that's very important.

07:38.412 --> 07:39.454
This is more important.

07:39.474 --> 07:40.235
Yes, I can see now.

07:41.057 --> 07:42.820
OK, excellent.

07:42.840 --> 07:45.044
And I can take no photographs, right?

07:45.545 --> 07:46.266
No photographs?

07:47.188 --> 07:48.189
Well, you can.

07:48.249 --> 07:48.710
Thank you.

07:49.071 --> 07:51.235
I'd love to have a picture of you, too.

07:51.796 --> 07:55.743
By my... No, not this.

07:55.783 --> 07:57.005
The literature, you too.

07:57.025 --> 07:57.506
With me?

07:57.586 --> 07:58.828
Yes, of course.

07:59.213 --> 08:08.308
Oh, that's very nice, Father.

08:09.110 --> 08:22.993
Thank you.

08:26.703 --> 08:49.689
They can't leave you all the time.

08:50.089 --> 08:53.453
Always.

08:54.091 --> 09:10.132
This is the manuscript room.

09:10.192 --> 09:12.656
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

09:12.676 --> 09:19.445
A private library, all gifts, given by an anonymous minister of nations.

09:19.465 --> 09:21.908
And we had this in the 1920s here.

09:22.749 --> 09:23.490
And where was it?

09:23.808 --> 09:30.237
These books are all about political and also subject, right?

09:30.497 --> 09:35.865
And also diplomatic, historical, and also geography.

09:37.226 --> 09:42.874
So here you have some... Yes, of course.

09:43.014 --> 09:44.356
Yes, of course.

09:46.739 --> 09:49.223
Description de l'Egypte.

09:49.243 --> 09:49.864
That's right.

09:49.924 --> 09:52.988
That's a double folio, elephant folio sized book here.

09:53.660 --> 09:55.002
special looks.

09:55.042 --> 10:04.274
You haven't been in Italy.

10:04.294 --> 10:05.015
Thank you.

10:05.135 --> 10:11.063
In the 1860 we came in Venice.

10:11.184 --> 10:15.970
And we land here in Gonson for six months.

10:16.371 --> 10:21.878
And people who were coming in this island twice in the week for learning Amir language.

10:22.280 --> 10:27.450
And he learned Armenian language in this room after six months.

10:27.470 --> 10:31.898
He was able to translate from Armenian to English, and from English to Armenian.

10:33.081 --> 10:33.722
In this room?

10:34.103 --> 10:36.627
In this room he learned Armenian.

10:36.648 --> 10:37.529
A nice picture.

10:38.110 --> 10:43.621
And he wrote also here in the last chapter of St.

10:43.661 --> 10:44.743
Herbert's sentence.

10:45.719 --> 10:47.200
Did you know that one?

10:47.461 --> 10:50.403
Charles Harold's Figaro, which is a famous poem.

10:50.423 --> 10:51.844
Yes, the poem of the Bible.

10:51.864 --> 10:52.645
And he wrote it.

10:52.665 --> 10:54.146
It was here, in the last chapter.

10:55.167 --> 10:57.749
That's exciting, it's right in this poem.

10:58.490 --> 11:05.136
And here we have this one about thinking on the lagoon.

11:05.156 --> 11:06.657
Oh, that's a famous picture.

11:06.697 --> 11:07.658
I've seen that picture.

11:07.898 --> 11:09.019
That's a famous picture.

11:12.522 --> 11:14.344
He enjoyed the island.

11:14.364 --> 11:15.625
He used to walk all out here.

11:16.347 --> 11:31.069
Very peaceful out here.

11:31.089 --> 11:35.595
It applies for thinking, for writing.

11:35.856 --> 11:41.945
Our activity is only cultural.

11:42.606 --> 11:44.869
Very important.

11:46.418 --> 11:51.224
The only activity is cultural.

11:53.648 --> 12:04.122
This room that we're going into now... Can you tell us where we're going into the manuscript?

12:04.182 --> 12:16.138
This is in 1967.

12:16.355 --> 12:21.841
But 8 years before the 5th, we had in the old library of the manuscripts.

12:21.861 --> 12:22.521
You had a library?

12:22.582 --> 12:23.262
Yes.

12:23.342 --> 12:25.845
In the sacristy, in the old church.

12:25.865 --> 12:31.551
And also the library was up there, also on the... But the manuscript was here.

12:31.571 --> 12:35.936
So you were lucky.

12:36.136 --> 12:36.837
Fortunate.

12:36.857 --> 12:37.017
Yes.

12:37.037 --> 12:39.199
I say always, this is a minor foresight.

12:42.923 --> 12:43.003
Yes.

12:43.405 --> 12:46.189
So, in this library you had four thousand in Manskitts?

12:47.731 --> 12:48.412
Four thousand.

12:48.432 --> 12:50.795
Dating from how... From Armenia.

12:50.875 --> 12:51.956
All coming from Armenia.

12:52.076 --> 12:52.597
All Armenia.

12:52.737 --> 12:53.819
Yes, from Armenia.

12:53.839 --> 12:54.960
And how did these come here?

12:54.980 --> 12:57.944
These were brought by the founder and his followers too?

12:58.525 --> 12:58.825
No.

12:59.646 --> 13:01.709
No, no, no.

13:01.729 --> 13:02.931
But after.

13:03.171 --> 13:12.163
After the founder, you had... the father was going in Armenia and searching the most important Manskitts.

13:12.515 --> 13:18.382
So the author is from the 7th century.

13:20.445 --> 13:22.827
The author is Armenian manuscripts.

13:22.847 --> 13:24.069
And was it here?

13:24.149 --> 13:25.290
Not here, and now.

13:28.534 --> 13:30.236
But here we have not only a manuscript.

13:31.197 --> 13:32.719
Interesting, you have the Koran.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.001
That's the Koran.

13:34.381 --> 13:36.544
The Koran of the Kupik letter.

13:36.564 --> 13:40.168
We have a signature of Peter the Grape, an edict of Peter the Grape.

13:40.188 --> 13:41.109
That's Peter the Grape.

13:41.189 --> 13:42.471
Yes, yes, yes.

13:42.839 --> 13:45.501
Does that relate to Armenia at all?

13:45.541 --> 13:54.589
Because there was, I mean, it was, who had the promise with the Russians.

13:55.090 --> 13:56.031
What is this?

13:56.051 --> 13:57.272
This is a, yeah.

13:58.613 --> 14:12.205
It's an edict given by the first son of Russia, and given in four, not a

14:12.556 --> 14:13.217
Pierre Abrault.

14:13.697 --> 14:14.338
Peter Abrault.

14:15.299 --> 14:16.541
I mean, not Abrault.

14:17.162 --> 14:18.564
And it's dated 1717.

14:20.126 --> 14:20.807
When we came here.

14:21.267 --> 14:22.769
The nobel was Pierre.

14:23.230 --> 14:24.271
Pierre, yeah, also.

14:24.291 --> 14:25.352
The nobel was Pierre.

14:25.412 --> 14:26.414
Pierre Abrault.

14:26.434 --> 14:27.896
And that's his signature right there.

14:28.196 --> 14:29.137
Oh, Peter the Great.

14:29.157 --> 14:29.858
Peter the Great.

14:31.620 --> 14:32.622
That's quite impressive.

14:32.942 --> 14:38.990
And this is, in Hebrew, the book of Ephraim.

14:39.010 --> 14:39.410
The book of Ephraim.

14:39.430 --> 14:39.971
The book of Ephraim.

14:39.991 --> 14:41.493
The Indian papillus m'accordion form.

14:42.114 --> 14:42.394
Oh, it's good.

14:43.032 --> 14:43.793
But this is odd.

14:44.173 --> 14:46.797
This is from 1,300.

14:47.378 --> 14:49.961
And that's like a palm book.

14:50.121 --> 14:55.949
That's a palm book on your palm leaves.

14:59.574 --> 15:06.042
Let's make this one.

15:07.224 --> 15:09.126
That's Ethiopia.

15:10.808 --> 15:12.010
These are pretty old here.

15:12.277 --> 15:13.499
It's a beautiful room.

15:13.960 --> 15:14.180
Yeah.

15:14.440 --> 15:15.422
Who designed this?

15:15.622 --> 15:20.450
The architect is the son of the benefactor.

15:21.131 --> 15:26.720
The benefactor was Ispenian, and his son was the architect.

15:27.622 --> 15:29.685
It's very, it's like a church.

15:30.466 --> 15:37.137
It's also with the materialization for the climate, the humidity.

15:38.703 --> 15:41.306
Because they're all protected, but there is light.

15:41.407 --> 15:43.469
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:44.210 --> 15:47.454
And the idea of doing it circular, is that symbolic?

15:47.474 --> 15:50.138
Yes, because the old library was simpler.

15:51.379 --> 16:02.854
Is there a book we could buy or something with some history, a book in English?

16:02.914 --> 16:05.638
When I give you a book about this, I give it.

16:05.838 --> 16:09.502
Okay, just briefly, these are magnificent.

16:09.562 --> 16:19.174
This is a lap of Alexander the Great in comics.

16:19.234 --> 16:22.057
Every time is all illuminated.

16:23.299 --> 16:23.999
At how old?

16:24.640 --> 16:27.744
It's from the 1300s.

16:27.804 --> 16:29.466
12 or 13th century.

16:29.866 --> 16:31.288
No, 13th century, 13th century.

16:31.505 --> 16:36.833
Twelve hundred, that's seven hundred years old almost.

16:37.374 --> 16:39.958
And that's the original book.

16:39.998 --> 16:49.513
But, attention, this is a translation of

16:50.658 --> 16:51.659
The Greek was lost.

16:51.679 --> 16:52.460
Only copy.

16:52.480 --> 16:55.223
So this is, you know, the original.

16:55.243 --> 16:57.927
Yes, yes, because it's the only translation you have of all this.

16:57.947 --> 16:58.948
So what do we call this?

16:59.228 --> 17:00.390
Do you have a name for that?

17:00.410 --> 17:02.352
The Life of Alexander the Great.

17:02.372 --> 17:03.373
Life of Alexander the Great.

17:04.755 --> 17:05.976
And this was done in Armenia.

17:06.116 --> 17:08.279
It's a copy of a Greek manuscript?

17:08.760 --> 17:14.006
Yes, it's a translation of a Greek manuscript and the Greek original is lost.

17:15.327 --> 17:16.148
That's very important.

17:17.090 --> 17:19.973
Now, we have some other books or other manuscripts.

17:20.223 --> 17:22.566
but also a filon.

17:23.628 --> 17:28.935
May I take a picture in here?

17:28.995 --> 17:29.095
Yes.

17:29.116 --> 17:29.256
Filon.

17:29.276 --> 17:29.436
Filonet.

17:30.397 --> 17:34.443
Filonet was a filonet.

17:40.492 --> 17:41.573
Magnificent.

17:49.062 --> 17:50.844
I'm trying to take a picture of the dedication here.

17:56.410 --> 17:57.071
One more here.

17:58.253 --> 18:05.020
Great.

18:09.846 --> 18:10.046
Thank you.

18:12.128 --> 18:12.329
Thank you.

18:12.349 --> 18:17.094
The first Christians, some of the first Christians in the world, veterans.

18:17.114 --> 18:18.816
He's nodding his head, yes.

18:19.150 --> 18:42.188
Thank you, Stephen.

18:57.727 --> 19:20.781
This is your group here
