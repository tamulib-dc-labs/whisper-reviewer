00:02.377 --> 00:07.182
Let's take three with the injection.

00:07.202 --> 00:10.946
Oh, I know one small bit of a brain thread that I somehow got distracted from.

00:11.426 --> 00:14.970
The one other great advantage of living in California is you don't have to pay for your heat.

00:15.551 --> 00:22.998
And if you look at what's tax-deductible and what isn't, you're going to have a hard time taking off the heating of your entire house.

00:23.138 --> 00:27.743
I mean, not that I take my heat off the taxes, but I don't pay anything to keep it warm, really.

00:28.162 --> 00:36.461
So the idea, it seems to me, is to have as many pleasures in life as are tax deductible and as few non-tax deductible.

00:36.761 --> 00:44.238
And I actually, while I don't object to telling you I make $20,000, I don't like, it's not, I think I'd rather you didn't print it.

00:44.258 --> 00:46.423
You can say I make a very small amount of money.

00:46.690 --> 00:55.202
The reason I don't, I dislike the sort of journal, you know, everything with Rosenbach is all, you know, he sold it for $300,000, therefore it's an important book.

00:55.543 --> 01:00.070
I dislike the, you know, I recognize there is money involved in these things.

01:00.090 --> 01:07.180
I dislike the equation, particularly very much, especially in America, of...

01:07.666 --> 01:09.769
money, intellect, occupation.

01:10.410 --> 01:15.378
I know it appeals to, from a journalistic point of view, it's a useful thing.

01:15.418 --> 01:17.241
I'm not presumpting to be coy.

01:17.601 --> 01:21.067
You can just indicate a certain modest expectations.

01:21.127 --> 01:25.333
And what I've described, of course, to you... Well, it's basically subsistence expectations.

01:25.354 --> 01:30.822
Yeah, but as I say, I don't feel, you know, this great deal of difference between me and someone who...

01:31.612 --> 01:36.019
This isn't for everybody, is what I think it's important.

01:36.099 --> 01:38.322
It's an important point to face it.

01:38.522 --> 01:48.217
I think you're living a wonderful, exciting, exhilarating life, precisely the life that you want to live and you're enjoying it.

01:48.237 --> 01:50.901
But I don't think that you would want to recommend this.

01:51.101 --> 01:51.822
Yeah, absolutely not.

01:51.842 --> 01:52.403
And that's the point.

01:52.483 --> 01:56.269
I do feel there are other people who are making small amounts of money

01:56.738 --> 01:58.520
you know, washing dishes or something.

01:58.580 --> 02:00.282
Those people have no greater hope.

02:00.422 --> 02:04.547
I always have the sense of, you know, powers in reserve.

02:05.008 --> 02:07.851
I have willfully sold in a particular way.

02:07.871 --> 02:09.113
I mean, there are loads of things I could do.

02:09.153 --> 02:10.074
I could buy a computer.

02:10.114 --> 02:11.375
I could publicize myself.

02:12.316 --> 02:16.001
I could reduce long, unprofitable blurbs.

02:16.081 --> 02:18.964
I could do research on more expensive books in order to make more money.

02:19.165 --> 02:21.047
There are loads of ways I could make lots more money.

02:21.407 --> 02:26.273
All I've tried to do is, as painlessly as possible, make enough money to live on.

02:26.472 --> 02:37.303
And in California, you can, you know, it has intellectual disadvantages to my mind, but on the other hand, you can live a fairly retired and inexpensive life.

02:37.343 --> 02:41.127
The one problem is housing, which is fairly expensive.

02:41.467 --> 02:47.733
So I basically try to make enough money to pay the insurance and the property tax and that sort of thing.

02:47.753 --> 02:51.137
And then you're fortunate that your wife also has an income.

02:51.157 --> 02:51.417
Right.

02:52.122 --> 02:55.466
You mentioned that you're teaching your son over there.

02:55.486 --> 03:07.279
If you don't want to bring him into the discourse at all, but it is interesting how you talked about education and reading and your first library card when you were one boy, really, in Illinois.

03:09.842 --> 03:14.487
Are you encouraging your son to kind of move in the same direction in his reading?

03:14.507 --> 03:14.827
We've not.

03:15.147 --> 03:16.389
How are you?

03:17.210 --> 03:18.111
No, I've done nothing.

03:18.131 --> 03:19.092
You have a child here.

03:19.192 --> 03:20.273
We've done absolutely nothing.

03:20.894 --> 03:22.677
He simply follows his own best.

03:22.697 --> 03:32.933
And the people act, of course, because I like books as though we must have forced him to read from the very day of birth when, from a very young age.

03:34.956 --> 03:36.739
He wanted to be read through constantly.

03:36.779 --> 03:40.385
Our voices got very tired and we would have to read to him 10 hours a day.

03:40.405 --> 03:42.088
It was just insatiable.

03:42.829 --> 03:43.851
So you keep getting more books.

03:43.911 --> 03:47.256
The library here allows you to borrow 100 books as a child

03:47.843 --> 03:50.326
And my wife has a card and he has a card.

03:50.366 --> 03:53.290
So between the two of them, they can keep 200 books out at any one time.

03:53.650 --> 03:55.453
And there are no fines for children.

03:56.093 --> 03:57.655
So no overdue fines or anything.

03:58.136 --> 03:58.817
Wonderful system.

03:58.837 --> 03:59.938
And they have very good books.

04:00.299 --> 04:04.884
The library here is supported by a separate tax assessment.

04:04.945 --> 04:10.672
It used to be part of the general city budget.

04:10.692 --> 04:12.714
You now pay something on your property tax.

04:12.774 --> 04:14.897
We pay maybe $250 a year.

04:15.417 --> 04:21.986
in relation to our house value to support the library.

04:22.006 --> 04:24.089
And as a result, they really have a good... That's a lot of money.

04:24.109 --> 04:25.752
Each individual pays that much money.

04:25.772 --> 04:29.437
Well, every owner of a house worth roughly this, which is probably an average Berkeley house.

04:29.457 --> 04:31.620
Well, this is probably actually a slightly cheaper Berkeley house.

04:32.341 --> 04:35.005
About $250 of that money goes to the library.

04:35.606 --> 04:36.487
That's an enormous amount.

04:36.507 --> 04:37.829
Yeah, it's a lot more than most people do.

04:38.150 --> 04:39.471
We have their place over in Marin County.

04:39.491 --> 04:42.015
They've got nothing but a county library system, and they spend, I don't know.

04:42.991 --> 04:45.275
$5 per person here, something that's pathetic.

04:45.575 --> 04:47.058
Now, Berkeley is a very literate community.

04:47.318 --> 04:48.961
Books, it's a great place to sell books.

04:48.981 --> 04:51.745
I mean, that's another way I'm cutting my own throat.

04:52.166 --> 04:58.556
I'm sitting in a spot where I could live in western Massachusetts, so I could sell this house and buy five houses like this in western Massachusetts.

04:59.237 --> 05:04.385
And if I'm just living in a closet existence, Berkeley is a magnificent place to sell books.

05:04.405 --> 05:07.851
The, you know, Black Oak, I mean, this place is just...

05:08.118 --> 05:19.390
There are loads of people with a fair amount of money who actually do, they may not be buying the book-size scheme all the time, but nonetheless, it's a very, and the same with the library.

05:19.410 --> 05:27.478
A lot of people have spent fair amounts of money on the... What, you got a coffee?

05:27.679 --> 05:28.559
Well, it's just down the street.

05:28.579 --> 05:32.944
It's better, it's just coffee in Berkeley.

05:33.194 --> 05:34.475
It's just halfway down the street.

05:35.116 --> 05:39.500
We make tea ourselves, but the coffee we usually go down and go.

05:41.122 --> 05:44.825
So anyway, he's always been interested in... He's always wanted to be read to.

05:44.885 --> 05:48.289
He learned with reading that really sort of unconsciously.

05:48.349 --> 05:54.235
Eventually, a friend of mine said, just put your finger under the words as you read them, when he was about three or so.

05:54.795 --> 05:56.717
And he pretty soon, you know, he didn't sound things out.

05:56.757 --> 05:57.958
He just seized the whole word.

05:58.219 --> 06:01.682
And he now reads extremely... I mean, he could read books which...

06:02.017 --> 06:03.879
He's been reading for maybe a year and a half.

06:03.899 --> 06:13.030
He reads books which are sort of junior high, there's sort of level of page density of junior high to high school textbooks.

06:13.051 --> 06:21.501
And, you know, like Lee's Time Life Middle Eastern cookery book, which is presumably meant sort of for adults, is, you know, in large words, he will sound out.

06:21.941 --> 06:24.104
First thing he read was Times Literary Supplements.

06:25.766 --> 06:31.433
So big, long words that often are stumbling blocks for children don't seem to...

06:31.700 --> 06:33.623
So, and, you know, we've always bought books from them.

06:33.643 --> 06:36.506
There's a wonderful shop where you can buy quite cheap children's books.

06:36.526 --> 06:41.954
So he has lots of books of his own, and he borrows lots of books from the library, and it's his chief interest in life.

06:41.974 --> 06:47.982
But I don't think we've, I mean, obviously, Steve and I have books around, but we've never said, we're going to sit down and read to you.

06:48.042 --> 06:52.488
He's always the one who's bullying us to read, or he wants such and such a book.

06:52.508 --> 06:53.369
So he's extremely bookish.

06:53.409 --> 07:01.099
I think it's a, you know, Charles and Eric's idea is they want to believe from democratic, egalitarian things that everything is environmental, environmental.

07:01.450 --> 07:03.512
And I think heredity creates environment.

07:04.093 --> 07:05.074
Nothing you can print.

07:05.475 --> 07:11.942
But, I mean, without having a profound eugenic view of life, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

07:11.962 --> 07:12.983
Oh, I love that game.

07:13.044 --> 07:15.627
But I'm going to talk to your daddy.

07:16.007 --> 07:18.009
Oh, you like this game?

07:18.049 --> 07:19.791
A place, bourgeois.

07:19.811 --> 07:21.273
It's all in French.

07:22.034 --> 07:24.357
It's all in French.

07:29.262 --> 07:29.803
That's great.

07:30.121 --> 07:37.510
So I do think there is a liberty, you know, if I were promoting my manner of existence, I do think Americans are greedy people.

07:37.530 --> 07:39.392
They want to have vastly too many possessions.

07:39.712 --> 07:45.219
I certainly have an aesthetic strain, an aesthetic aestheticism.

07:45.239 --> 07:54.289
And, you know, I think you can get along with not a great deal, but I don't have the hopelessness that a person making...

07:54.944 --> 08:01.233
you know, washing dishes at $20,000 a year might well have, because I do feel I could do something else.

08:01.253 --> 08:06.441
And, you know, to some degree, you know, I still pack my own books.

08:06.501 --> 08:07.302
I have no employee.

08:08.204 --> 08:19.821
There's a lot of dog's body work that many a person who has a theorem, or in French, I should say, possibly knows as much about books as I do, does not have to do.

08:20.105 --> 08:34.604
But I do think even without an intellect, if you have some degree of memory and you're crazy to sell books if you don't, and you actually enjoy reading and you keep reading books, you can acquire a vast amount of knowledge that other people won't have.

08:34.624 --> 08:37.127
Now, I realize my extreme example.

08:37.187 --> 08:40.151
I realize that most people, when they were young, didn't read 12 hours.

08:40.331 --> 08:45.117
Even today, although I've cut down my reading enormously, I probably read two hours during the day.

08:45.248 --> 08:47.972
and then I read from about 11 at night until 4 in the morning.

08:48.353 --> 08:49.935
So I still get in about six hours.

08:50.216 --> 08:55.283
And when do you commune with the books that you've acquired from your sale?

08:55.304 --> 08:56.205
When do you start doing that?

08:56.225 --> 08:58.368
Well, I often read the books before I sell the books.

08:58.508 --> 09:00.311
That's why it's so hopelessly uneconomical.

09:00.552 --> 09:02.274
Many of my books I've read before selling.

09:02.575 --> 09:06.461
I have a big table in there, I show you afterwards, of books that are sort of in process.

09:06.541 --> 09:10.547
I either have to read them and then decide whether I'm keeping them or not, or read them and write the blurb.

09:10.966 --> 09:17.113
And, you know, it's ridiculously uneconomical, but if you actually want to read the book anyway, then it's fine.

09:17.614 --> 09:21.138
I don't know whether to put you in a reader's chapter or a bookseller's chapter.

09:21.919 --> 09:25.863
I'm an extreme example of whatever.

09:26.083 --> 09:29.948
Are you a reader or a bookseller, in your view, if you were to pick one or the other?

09:29.968 --> 09:33.712
I would say I'm a reader because, obviously, I would quit bookselling tomorrow.

09:33.832 --> 09:36.195
I mean, Peter Howard, you could give him a million dollars.

09:36.215 --> 09:37.777
He'll be opening the shop tomorrow morning.

09:37.797 --> 09:38.998
He's never going to retire it.

09:39.367 --> 09:40.809
I was cheerfully tired.

09:40.829 --> 09:44.835
I asked him the fate of the business, and I guess it sounds like he's going to die with his boots on.

09:45.576 --> 09:48.320
And then whatever happens, happens.

09:48.340 --> 09:56.711
See, also another aspect that isn't present, I think booksellers stultify themselves, you know, with the one, the printing in the mind of man, all these things.

09:57.012 --> 10:01.198
It's not as though these people don't actually occasionally... You've mentioned that reference now at least six times.

10:01.218 --> 10:03.521
Yeah, well, it's a talismanic book.

10:03.541 --> 10:06.505
I mean, it's... I've got a copy of it, but it's...

10:06.653 --> 10:07.374
curious to me.

10:07.474 --> 10:09.017
You keep coming back to it.

10:09.037 --> 10:12.483
Well, I'm just taking a symbolic... No, but you keep coming back to it.

10:12.503 --> 10:14.106
You could have mentioned any number of other books.

10:14.166 --> 10:15.388
No, no, I couldn't.

10:15.408 --> 10:18.073
You look at the sort of bookselling that I'm stigmatizing.

10:18.093 --> 10:20.457
Well, I don't stigmatize printing in the mind of man.

10:21.198 --> 10:28.892
In fact, with Stephen Lowenthal, I say it may be said of this, you know, corruptio optimi pessima, the corruption of the best things is the worst thing.

10:30.154 --> 10:32.037
Gregory the Great.

10:32.523 --> 10:38.991
You have something that really is a superb book, and you have it as used by somebody like Stephen Lowenfeil, barbarized, prostituted.

10:39.031 --> 10:45.399
The reduction of learning to these books and those that are outside of the pale are somehow insignificant.

10:45.419 --> 10:53.129
And somebody like Lowenfeil, and there are others, attribute financial value to things that are supposedly intellectual.

10:53.149 --> 10:54.871
That's why I call him intellectual kitsch.

10:55.492 --> 10:56.353
He's debased.

10:57.127 --> 11:04.637
The appraised intellectual pitch is in where Peter gave you a copy of the Jackals.

11:04.657 --> 11:07.021
You bought a copy of the Jackals.

11:08.062 --> 11:09.144
He paid for them.

11:09.304 --> 11:09.824
He did buy them.

11:10.125 --> 11:11.527
And he paid $8 a copy.

11:11.947 --> 11:14.291
So why shouldn't he sell them?

11:14.651 --> 11:16.253
I believe in buying books.

11:17.074 --> 11:19.638
I'm happy to buy them.

11:19.758 --> 11:23.644
But that book codifies in a way that, say, Garrison Morton is just medical books.

11:23.664 --> 11:25.446
I mean, there are a lot of books for different subjects.

11:25.898 --> 11:40.307
But printing in the mind of man has had an enormous influence in making, I should remember, I'm supposed to get back to Lasky and one other thing, but I'm going to, this is something, oh, and Lasky and Calder in Illinois.

11:40.447 --> 11:42.311
Lasky, Calder, and Illinois.

11:42.331 --> 11:47.822
I usually, believe it or not, have a lot more input into these things that would.

11:48.022 --> 11:52.549
It does seem to me, I lose-shaped interviews sometimes, but this one, I'm just letting this one fly.

11:53.690 --> 11:55.934
I also think Americans speak much too slowly.

11:56.254 --> 12:01.642
I think you'll have a devil of a time getting down the rapid fire here.

12:03.104 --> 12:06.449
Also, Americans also very pedantically always complete their sentences.

12:06.529 --> 12:11.076
You'll notice I've probably started and failed to finish an enormous number of them.

12:12.389 --> 12:21.984
But when I was talking about Huntington and Shakespeare, even if Huntington didn't read Shakespeare, he could possibly quote a tag or so, or he wouldn't be reviled as someone who couldn't read Shakespeare.

12:22.425 --> 12:28.214
That whole notion of literary value, you will notice Shakespeare first folios are worth a lot.

12:28.755 --> 12:31.399
Tennyson first editions are not worth a lot at all.

12:31.640 --> 12:35.646
You can look, in fact, at the...

12:36.537 --> 12:40.623
price of English literature in relation to literary value.

12:40.683 --> 12:48.955
Now, I think that, you know, we may be told nowadays you cannot assign absolute literary values, but nonetheless, we can say that Tennyson is a greater poet than Ebenezer Jones.

12:49.796 --> 13:01.233
And we didn't make two fine distinctions, but it is perfectly true that price of a book bears no, of an English book of English literature, bears no relation to literary value.

13:01.734 --> 13:05.920
If you were a poet scorned in your lifetime and valued later

13:06.136 --> 13:07.859
your books may be very expensive.

13:07.879 --> 13:14.709
If you're a poet loved in your lifetime, like Shakespeare, not Shakespeare, but especially Tennyson, Tennyson is almost worthless.

13:15.150 --> 13:18.274
In those first editions we went through, even the first printings were enormous.

13:18.675 --> 13:21.098
He was the poet warrior, too.

13:21.139 --> 13:23.302
He was a very popular poet.

13:23.542 --> 13:25.786
So there were many, many copies of the books.

13:26.106 --> 13:26.747
Exactly.

13:27.929 --> 13:29.972
So people don't collect Tennyson very much.

13:30.172 --> 13:34.759
Bond at Harvard, the retired librarian, has been working on his bibliography for years and years,

13:35.178 --> 13:39.123
And it's just nothing that's ever going to set the world of collecting afire.

13:39.523 --> 13:44.990
Scott's Waverly novels, I mean, a lot of things where the supply and the rarity bears no relation to literary merit.

13:45.330 --> 13:53.060
So a person collecting English literature never makes the confusion that literary merit is somehow a lie to price.

13:53.541 --> 13:57.005
And the more literary quality, the more expensive it is.

13:57.025 --> 13:58.086
And that was a standard thing.

13:58.126 --> 14:01.270
In the old days, when the second and improved edition with scholarly books

14:01.402 --> 14:05.746
the second improved edition is still worth more than the first crappy edition.

14:06.107 --> 14:08.850
Well, would you rather have a fourth folio or a first folio?

14:08.870 --> 14:10.972
Oh, well, if you're a collector, of course you want the first folio.

14:11.032 --> 14:11.713
It's worth more money.

14:11.733 --> 14:15.436
And as a bookseller, of course, I'd rather have that so I could sell it, but I wouldn't dream of keeping it.

14:15.737 --> 14:30.852
But when talking, I think there's a distinction between scholarly books and the appreciation of English literature between what I'm about to mention, which is a factor which enters into printing in the mind of man, the connoisseurship of scientific books, a completely different thing.

14:31.203 --> 14:53.390
The consciousness of that is promoted by, you may even have it in your Gentle Madness, by Herman McLean Evans, right here at Berkeley, where the idea was that the famous author, this is post-Darwin, and Darwin spent years and years, instead of writing this, he would never have written up his Origin of Species in this little communication from Linnaean society if Wallace hadn't forestalled him, and he had to do this little thing.

14:53.650 --> 14:55.432
He was just wavering away on his big book.

14:55.933 --> 14:58.375
And the idea is you produce a big book.

14:58.396 --> 14:59.657
Copernicus has a book.

14:59.823 --> 15:02.386
He doesn't produce lots of little papers.

15:02.446 --> 15:04.228
Galilean published books.

15:04.248 --> 15:04.729
He died.

15:04.749 --> 15:07.231
Copernicus didn't see his book through the press, did he?

15:07.311 --> 15:12.477
But the idea is you produce your learning in the form of a big book, usually not a duodecima, by the way.

15:12.497 --> 15:14.920
You remember there's that whole codification of learning.

15:14.980 --> 15:18.664
Massive learning, folio learning they even called it, is in big books.

15:18.684 --> 15:23.129
Are you familiar with a book called Paratexts, by the way, by Jeanette G?

15:23.149 --> 15:25.832
It's just published by Cambridge University Press.

15:25.852 --> 15:28.575
Ken Carpenter at Harvard suggested I read it.

15:28.755 --> 15:29.256
He...

15:29.843 --> 15:37.095
It's by Bronson, E.H.

15:37.115 --> 15:37.595
Bronson.

15:37.615 --> 15:38.437
Peter had his library.

15:38.457 --> 15:39.558
He was a professor of English here.

15:39.959 --> 15:41.321
It's published by New York Public Library.

15:41.341 --> 15:44.446
It's called Printing as an Index of Taste in the 18th Century.

15:44.807 --> 15:52.259
It's the best single, it's only maybe, it's an off-print from the New York Public Library bulletin issued as a separate, went through several printings.

15:52.279 --> 15:55.564
And it even reprinted in one of his collections, but you should be able to find it around.

15:55.932 --> 15:57.815
It addresses exactly that.

15:57.955 --> 16:00.600
This is a French book, by the way.

16:04.306 --> 16:06.910
But it is a classic formulation.

16:06.950 --> 16:10.155
BP focuses primarily on French literature.

16:10.536 --> 16:11.958
Thinking is an index of taste.

16:11.978 --> 16:13.060
Taste in the 18th century.

16:13.481 --> 16:18.970
And the idea was, the sort of little book of poetry that you took over to the fireside, or a little book of prayers,

16:19.220 --> 16:23.024
The book's praise that's read up at the altar is big in folio so the priest can read it.

16:23.465 --> 16:29.272
The book that you take around into the fields and read in front of a chapel shrine, shrine out in the woods, is a little thing.

16:29.592 --> 16:39.163
And that, of course, has been, well, Harvard Library Bulletin, I've been kind of covering an excellent example of something gone down the drain, something that was sort of holdable, was now this big floppy, and it goes to the mail.

16:39.423 --> 16:40.985
This is typical Harvard arrogance.

16:41.005 --> 16:44.429
They don't realize by the time it crossed the entire country, it's a Harvard Library Bulletin.

16:44.449 --> 16:45.350
There's, yeah, shrapnel.

16:45.851 --> 16:48.754
So, at any rate, that's a

16:49.004 --> 16:53.208
The Book Collector, an admirable example, is a nice, small, readable thing.

16:53.228 --> 16:59.995
Nichols Park, of course, has superb scholarly and typographical taste, which is why it looks so good.

17:02.157 --> 17:18.133
But at any rate, the big book, The Massive Folio Learning, what you find is post-Darwin, when periodicals really take over and every subject starts having a journal of environmental studies, a journal of evolutionary biology, all this type of stuff,

17:18.333 --> 17:24.902
you tend to, and the pace increases, and there are more workers and priority and money and all this, you get these little, you know, it's like the DNA announcement.

17:24.922 --> 17:27.065
You just got this two-page article.

17:27.445 --> 17:40.763
And as Evans rightly pointed out, once you accept the paradigm of firsts, the first form in which it was in there, the way the author first saw his brainchild, all that sort of baloney, you're logically obliged to say that isn't

17:41.165 --> 17:48.093
Einstein's paper where he simply announces relativity in five pages more significant than some bigger volume he might have done.

17:48.113 --> 17:57.544
Of course, the scientist gets into the habit of, since his whole manner of thinking is not in big books, many people like Ross Harrison in Embryology never published a book.

17:57.684 --> 18:08.016
The one book is posthumous, very famous, but they're all just somewhat largest, you know, 100-page, 50-page papers, but it's all just papers, and that's the way they think.

18:08.283 --> 18:17.082
So Evans rightly pointed out that Mendel's announcement and all these things, little papers, are the things that a person should be collecting.

18:17.142 --> 18:17.783
How about AIDS?

18:17.803 --> 18:19.567
That is the first use of that word.

18:21.030 --> 18:21.852
I wonder what that is.

18:21.972 --> 18:27.203
It's probably collectible, but it hasn't been put into some book by some bookseller.

18:27.520 --> 18:29.382
We're saying this is the 12th.

18:29.422 --> 18:32.144
Yes, if there were an AIDS checklist, the AIDS 50 or something.

18:32.165 --> 18:34.467
I'm sure somebody's got to be working on that.

18:34.487 --> 18:43.496
Well, but you notice a lot of things that Jeremy has in his, you know, when he updated Garrison Morton, he had to put in things from mostly recent Nobel Prize things.

18:43.516 --> 18:48.360
He had to look around and find what was going to be considered the official collectible form of this.

18:49.021 --> 18:57.409
A lot of this sort of, you know, it's always takes, there's a little, collectors don't like something hot off the press.

18:57.743 --> 19:03.553
They want, they need a little time, but of course AIDS, I mean, you know, another five years AIDS will be adequate.

19:03.573 --> 19:10.045
Well, I'll bet when somebody, if somebody can figure out who coined that word, and who first identified it as what it is.

19:10.165 --> 19:13.150
Yeah, that's what, I'm sure already it's what, something like Wayne Duck.

19:13.170 --> 19:14.352
Whoever did that, that's,

19:14.332 --> 19:16.534
Well, this is even bigger than Lame Duck.

19:16.614 --> 19:19.137
I mean, this is a scourge on, you know, the world.

19:19.197 --> 19:21.499
Oh, no, I was meaning Lame Duck Book.

19:21.559 --> 19:25.624
Oh, no, Lame Duck Book sells that sort of stuff.

19:25.704 --> 19:26.084
They do, yeah.

19:26.104 --> 19:28.967
Sort of cutting-edge intellectual.

19:29.147 --> 19:32.911
I'm not as much a chronicleer of the antiquarian trade as you might say.

19:33.211 --> 19:35.954
No, I have a little clarity on Lame Duck, which I don't think I'll ever print.

19:35.974 --> 19:39.938
It begins at Lame Duck, grad students run amok.

19:39.958 --> 19:41.520
There's very much a...

19:41.737 --> 20:08.694
I mean, I may seem didactic, although he seems, he's a, it's just, it reeks of grad students, late night coffee, too many chess games, too much quotation of Nietzsche, and this sort of grad student speak, which I think is not a well-rounded, humane, not the sort of conversation you would get from Nicholas Barker and Arthur Freeman, rather brittle and staccato and slightly show-offy.

20:09.816 --> 20:11.558
Sort of the worst side of George Steiner

20:12.061 --> 20:21.136
At any rate, these things have been codified by Evans, and then there are later books, and then Ian Fleming, as no doubt you know, under Percy Moore's Tutelich-Quetti.

20:21.516 --> 20:34.397
And so Printing of the Mind of Man, which, of course, is really involved, is you really should compare the thing that Stanley Morrison and others did for the Cambridge exhibition in 1940, which was closed because of the war.

20:34.437 --> 20:35.859
I can show you the catalog upstairs.

20:35.879 --> 20:36.540
What was it called?

20:36.641 --> 20:37.562
It's called...

20:39.922 --> 20:42.765
something just like an exhibition of printing or something.

20:42.785 --> 20:49.112
It was one of the first attempts to relate printing to intellectual products in an exhibition.

20:49.152 --> 20:53.317
You see, one often forgets that Printing in the Mind of Man was actually two exhibitions.

20:53.397 --> 21:06.992
It was the things in the British Museum, the books, but it was also an exhibition at Earl's Court of all the printing equipment, which in the little paper-bound book, there's half of it as printing equipment.

21:07.192 --> 21:11.798
So there's very much the printing trades aspect of this sort of thing.

21:11.898 --> 21:16.924
It's something that certainly began nowadays with computerization and that influence on desktop publishing and all that.

21:16.985 --> 21:22.291
My friend Calder, as I said, is able to produce uncensored copy because it's desktop production.

21:22.652 --> 21:30.442
It's rather like the sort of printing that French typographers in Holland did in the 18th century.

21:30.462 --> 21:33.526
You had people who knew French who could print it, but you were away from French censorship.

21:33.766 --> 21:35.308
Or the Belgian contrefaçon...

21:35.542 --> 21:37.987
in the 19th century, and you have that nowadays.

21:38.007 --> 21:39.590
At any rate, those things can be interlocked.

21:39.610 --> 21:53.938
But you look at the Cambridge exhibition in 1940, you find a much more eclectic, possibly less pondered, a little more English literature, a little more Pollard and Viral

21:54.644 --> 21:57.147
The humane science hasn't totally taken over.

21:57.167 --> 21:59.609
And I don't say that putting in mind away as a complete sellout to science.

21:59.649 --> 22:04.735
It's sort of like the 11th of Danica, the last monument before scientific barbarism took over.

22:04.955 --> 22:16.308
But nonetheless, it codifies, and the further Garrison-Worton thinks, codifies the equation of scientific value with financial value, which is a given with these people like Jeremy Norman.

22:16.788 --> 22:20.432
And I'm not, it's Jonathan Hill, a whole group of them.

22:20.581 --> 22:26.312
Or Rick Watson's last catalogue, he's been trying to sell it for a while, his off-print, the DNA off-print.

22:26.352 --> 22:28.996
Do you know how much that sells for?

22:29.017 --> 22:30.239
£22,000, I think it is.

22:30.680 --> 22:32.343
It's three pages, printed in 1960.

22:32.403 --> 22:33.365
No, it's not that.

22:33.385 --> 22:35.248
You know, there were 25, 50 copies.

22:35.268 --> 22:37.753
There are slight Bob Dewey graphical complications.

22:38.153 --> 22:41.239
But nonetheless, it's not a beautiful piece of printing.

22:41.405 --> 22:49.441
It's only, it happens to be rare, and it's highly significant, and everybody that's heard of DNA in the way in which everyone Huntington knew had heard of Shakespeare.

22:49.461 --> 22:57.136
So you can, it may look like pretty pibbling stuff when you take it out of its cloth case to say to some friend, but no one can, you can say, the most important scientific development.

22:57.377 --> 23:02.427
Same with Darwin's Origin of Species in Low and File Cells, you know, most important biological book ever written.

23:02.447 --> 23:03.008
You get this

23:03.241 --> 23:04.543
Therefore, it's expensive.

23:04.823 --> 23:06.685
That doesn't exist in old book collecting.

23:06.705 --> 23:08.087
And I think that's a fallacy.

23:08.487 --> 23:09.949
It obviously is a fallacy.

23:09.969 --> 23:12.512
These people fall for a hook, line, and sinker.

23:12.532 --> 23:15.175
The result is they've corrupted their minds.

23:15.275 --> 23:21.883
The bookseller who follows printing the mind of man, Garrison Morton and all these things, has, I should say, there are some exceptions.

23:21.903 --> 23:26.929
There are people like Malcolm Kotler, who has a PhD in history of science, who has some degree of independent judgment.

23:26.949 --> 23:30.193
But many of these people are just following the book that they're selling.

23:30.460 --> 23:41.596
the bibliography that they're consulting, those people have convinced themselves that the really important things in life are the things in these books, not just printing in the mind of man, but a select group of a hundred things.

23:42.097 --> 23:49.328
They have no independent judgment, and they've eliminated all sorts of other quite important things that just didn't happen to fit in the collecting paradigm.

23:49.348 --> 23:57.700
The notion that collecting and book selling somehow relate in a direct manner to intellectual pursuits

23:57.865 --> 24:02.170
is a total fiction that is assiduously promoted by booksellers.

24:02.731 --> 24:06.976
And I feel if I got more involved, I always hope to retire.

24:07.316 --> 24:16.407
If I decide to totally sell out to bookselling, I'd be willing to, of course I hope to retire, totally corrupt my mind and yes, decide, well, it's worth $2,000.

24:16.467 --> 24:19.350
It must be more important than a book that's worth $10,000.

24:19.482 --> 24:27.009
which these people, you know, you put it baldy like this, they'll try to deny it, but the evidence of their catalogs, auction prices, everything is completely... Haven No More is the same.

24:27.029 --> 24:32.575
Haven No More is a total charlatan in this, you know, pseudo-spiritual gobbledygook of these great things.

24:32.615 --> 24:40.022
Well, they're piles of famous spiritual things that aren't worth a lot of money and they don't have this... Haven No More didn't read any of these things.

24:40.042 --> 24:46.289
I mean, it's just complete... Yeah, but we're encouraging people like that.

24:46.309 --> 24:48.831
I mean, Haven No More is a typical American charlatan.

24:49.503 --> 24:58.393
And a typical result of bad educational systems, in many other countries, a person like Haveno Moore would be washing dishes somewhere, wouldn't become an intellectual... S.O.

24:58.413 --> 25:00.195
in health and supplements.

25:00.215 --> 25:03.639
Yeah, which is where there's rough information.

25:03.699 --> 25:04.620
Yeah, exactly.

25:05.001 --> 25:09.166
But I feel if you... Peter Howard has... I don't object in the least to Peter Howard.

25:09.186 --> 25:10.527
He's a very successful bookseller.

25:10.547 --> 25:15.493
He's indeed a great bookseller in a sense which I never could possibly be, even if I wanted to.

25:15.608 --> 25:19.134
But to a degree, he is sold out to his customers.

25:19.394 --> 25:20.757
You may say this is devotion.

25:20.817 --> 25:22.620
I'm putting it unkindly saying, sold out.

25:22.940 --> 25:24.243
He's looking after their interests.

25:24.263 --> 25:26.366
If they say this is important, it is important.

25:26.627 --> 25:28.329
I can give you an excellent example of this.

25:28.530 --> 25:32.456
Well, I mean, that is a very didactic position to take, though, don't you think?

25:32.717 --> 25:33.358
My position?

25:33.378 --> 25:33.618
Yes.

25:33.638 --> 25:34.199
Yes, of course.

25:34.259 --> 25:36.663
But you're telling me what's important.

25:37.224 --> 25:41.211
Not allowing the customer to tell you what the customer thinks is important.

25:41.377 --> 25:44.941
Do I know more than if, yeah, right, but you're cringing to the customer.

25:44.961 --> 25:46.763
You're claiming the customer knows more than you do.

25:46.784 --> 25:49.747
I try not to deal with customers who know less than I do.

25:49.787 --> 25:51.569
Peter is selling to idiots, basically.

25:51.589 --> 25:52.130
Really, he is.

25:52.510 --> 25:56.655
I'm trying to sell to people who are at least my peers, possibly even my superior.

25:57.056 --> 25:58.578
Not all of them, but some of them.

25:59.259 --> 26:04.225
And I feel there's certainly a world, you know, somebody like Calder, he knows what he's talking about.

26:04.245 --> 26:07.148
And I supply him, yes, I try to supply him with the sort of books he wants.

26:07.465 --> 26:11.930
But I don't, you know, I would never have wanted to sell a book to Haver no more.

26:11.990 --> 26:17.476
What's the great, what to you is a really exciting find in a book?

26:17.496 --> 26:21.240
I mean, you've read God knows how many books, the books that you come across.

26:21.500 --> 26:23.803
Do you know most of the books that you come across?

26:24.663 --> 26:26.966
No, you keep finding more things.

26:26.986 --> 26:27.907
You can go through your entire life.

26:27.927 --> 26:28.928
You can never find everything.

26:29.368 --> 26:30.790
But do you have these experiences?

26:30.955 --> 26:34.619
exciting, epiphanous moments when you say, wow, I didn't know about them.

26:34.639 --> 26:37.001
Yeah, they're for maybe about five times in my life.

26:37.081 --> 26:40.085
I've rediscovered a few, but you know, they're two things of no commercial value.

26:40.605 --> 26:41.947
Books like R.H.

26:41.967 --> 26:45.750
Quip's Life and Memoir, a completely uncelebrated book.

26:45.771 --> 26:48.593
Quip wrote Educational Reformers, he's well known for that.

26:49.294 --> 26:53.058
A remarkable volume of observations of school children.

26:53.939 --> 26:58.684
Henri Rourda, R-O-R-D-A.

26:58.968 --> 27:00.991
Dutch-verse, but actually Swiss.

27:01.511 --> 27:06.157
Again, a rather cynical schoolmaster who killed himself about 1925.

27:06.357 --> 27:10.943
I'd never heard of him until I found the book on a second-hand bookshelf.

27:11.544 --> 27:20.916
One does find those things, but I find just as many obscure and unusual things in libraries, possibly even more, because they're all on the shelves if you've got an open stack.

27:20.956 --> 27:22.318
That's what it is by this place.

27:22.338 --> 27:27.304
It's now the shelves, they've got compact shelving, and they've got shelves, say, this wide, this many books.

27:27.605 --> 27:31.411
The rest is all in storage because they never want to have to reshelve anything.

27:31.451 --> 27:32.492
So they'll buy it.

27:32.512 --> 27:34.695
It's ready for the next 50 years of expansion.

27:34.715 --> 27:38.060
You can see nothing but new books that you can see basically on a bookshop.

27:38.601 --> 27:42.527
And to me, I mean, the University of Illinois was all out on the shelf.

27:42.567 --> 27:44.269
The Boston Athenaeum is still on the shelf.

27:44.930 --> 27:48.375
And you really have a sense of what's out there.

27:48.395 --> 27:50.398
These people, again, you look at the Internet.

27:50.659 --> 27:52.321
They claim all the information is out there.

27:52.521 --> 27:55.185
You just have a sort of vague sense that it's there.

27:55.566 --> 27:56.447
You don't know...

27:56.815 --> 28:03.184
how much total information there is, you have no idea what single fact that you have bears to the totality of human knowledge.

28:03.445 --> 28:09.033
When I get back to Patterson and his 20,000 volumes, what relation does that bear to the totality of human knowledge?

28:09.053 --> 28:10.815
You can never know that with the Internet.

28:11.116 --> 28:13.018
With a book and with some thoughts, you can think.

28:13.038 --> 28:24.595
And again, when I say know thyself, you always want to know what relation your knowledge bears to the totality of knowledge, something to make you perhaps more humble than many a bookseller is.

28:24.794 --> 28:27.458
Those people have the theory, I know all of printing in mind.

28:27.678 --> 28:29.501
Many of those people have memorized what's in it.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.083
I'm sure Stephen Lowenfeld does.

28:31.103 --> 28:32.786
They know all the names of Nobel Prize winners.

28:32.846 --> 28:34.568
If the person won a Nobel Prize, you can sell it.

28:36.091 --> 28:39.796
They've got that kind of knowledge, and they think that it's very useful commercial knowledge.

28:39.856 --> 28:41.859
It's not terribly useful intellectual knowledge.

28:41.879 --> 28:51.173
And since I've always spent most of my time reading books and trying to sell them in not too compromising a way, I feel if I try to swallow the...

28:51.355 --> 28:54.601
It's not so much the annotations in Printing the Mind of Man are wrong.

28:54.621 --> 28:55.162
They're perfectly good.

28:55.182 --> 28:58.990
And if you had read every book in there, you would have an excellent range of knowledge.

28:59.230 --> 29:04.380
It's the idea that what they say about it is what's to be said about that book in all contexts.

29:04.461 --> 29:06.765
Now, they don't even, of course, they don't even claim that.

29:06.982 --> 29:11.549
But the idea a person absorbs this and sees Copernicus such and such, this is what there is to Copernicus.

29:11.569 --> 29:24.249
There's an enormous amount more to Copernicus, which if you knew a lot more, you could then relate it to, you know, your wife has, you know, think of, I don't know, Innocent of the Tenth and the fact that he couldn't get rid of mirrors in Spanish convents.

29:24.269 --> 29:29.617
You can think of the relation of mirror technology in 1500, how good were mirrors.

29:29.637 --> 29:32.922
Remember, they couldn't make mirrors beyond about this size, the silvering.

29:32.902 --> 29:34.724
of looking glasses is a very primitive thing.

29:34.744 --> 29:42.234
Early, you see some of those Chippendale mirror frames, unless they've been reglazed, they've got two mirrors in them, because they couldn't make the glass any bigger.

29:42.474 --> 29:46.839
If you've got something, how does the vanity of nuns, what do they see there?

29:46.879 --> 29:48.782
Do they see a fuzzy view of themselves?

29:49.082 --> 29:53.087
Do they, if they happen to see, if they've never seen a mirror for 30 years, and then they look in it, and they

29:53.236 --> 29:55.499
They don't recognize their own face anymore.

29:55.800 --> 29:59.465
Or how is female vanity fed by glass technology?

29:59.765 --> 30:01.467
There are loads of those things that you'd never see.

30:01.888 --> 30:08.958
If you knew all of astronomy, you would be able to understand that.

30:09.158 --> 30:09.959
That's another aspect.

30:09.979 --> 30:15.767
These people think, once we've said what's important about Copernicus for world civilization,

30:15.899 --> 30:19.183
Well, you know, we've said most of it, and I think these people, they have no curiosity.

30:19.223 --> 30:23.148
Their end of their curiosity is to basically have read the blurbs depending on the mind of that.

30:23.368 --> 30:25.811
And I think you convert, you know you're lying.

30:25.891 --> 30:36.465
See, that's why in many of my blurbs, I'm playing with the idea that all booksellers know they're slanting, as I say, the art of making it seem more desirable than it is without actually lying.

30:36.885 --> 30:39.949
You even sort of tell the person you're almost about to...

30:40.739 --> 30:43.966
position it in a false way so it'll seem more desirable.

30:44.226 --> 30:46.291
Horch had one catalog where they were trying to sell something.

30:46.652 --> 30:56.192
Horch had in the catalog, they said if something they were trying to sell for 5,000 pounds that was unique, they said if this were a stamp, it would be worth 10 times the amount, which is perfectly true.

30:56.453 --> 30:59.018
These whole phony...

30:59.116 --> 31:02.261
I think you just have to ignore money, and I basically have ignored money.

31:02.361 --> 31:06.206
I pay a certain amount for a book, and I sell it for more than I've paid for it.

31:06.226 --> 31:08.330
But there are many of Argon in my catalog.

31:08.570 --> 31:10.192
I've never tried to get the last dollar.

31:10.292 --> 31:13.657
Indeed, customers will call the last dollar out of it.

31:13.918 --> 31:15.881
There's always room for another bookseller.

31:16.301 --> 31:21.609
Booksellers will even call me up and say, you know, I've never heard of that, but your prices are always quite reasonable, so I think I'd like to get it.

31:21.629 --> 31:23.051
Do you think there's room for me in it?

31:23.131 --> 31:24.393
And I said, oh, yes, Henry.

31:24.413 --> 31:25.254
You know, I'm asking 150.

31:25.274 --> 31:26.997
They're buying your judgment, too, I think.

31:27.348 --> 31:29.151
They're not necessarily buying your book.

31:29.171 --> 31:38.083
They're buying your... Of course, there is a downside of that, which is there are some books people have never succeeded in selling because they don't have my blurb to go with it.

31:38.143 --> 31:39.645
Why don't they use your blurb?

31:40.006 --> 31:46.675
Well, maybe they... I should probably announce at the beginning that in my... A lot of books... I said you could just copy my blurb.

31:46.695 --> 31:49.459
Well, the trouble is, as you'll see, they're fairly distinctive.

31:49.759 --> 31:52.703
And if you ever have... Will you have some for me that I can... I'll give you some.

31:53.004 --> 31:55.347
If you ask a question of...

31:55.462 --> 32:01.267
Yes, if the bookseller Xeroxes it, sticks it in there and pretends it's his own, he may be asked an awkward question.

32:01.707 --> 32:05.451
People will notice that his conversation is not... My analogs are just like my conversation.

32:06.251 --> 32:09.054
Most booksellers have... No, they are.

32:09.074 --> 32:09.814
You'll see, you'll see.

32:09.874 --> 32:11.256
They're exactly like my conversation.

32:11.736 --> 32:15.619
I mean, we'll possibly remove some... How would you characterize your conversation?

32:18.101 --> 32:19.062
Rapid fire.

32:21.244 --> 32:22.165
Highly discursive.

32:22.325 --> 32:24.507
Unremunerishably, uncommercially discursive.

32:24.908 --> 32:27.712
You notice I still haven't finished Calder, which I was going to finish.

32:28.313 --> 32:33.100
Calder claimed he used to be at Boulder, and he left Boulder.

32:33.160 --> 32:34.301
He's very nearsighted.

32:34.682 --> 32:35.543
All you can do is Boulder.

32:35.563 --> 32:37.506
I mean, Boulder, complete intellectual isolation there.

32:37.526 --> 32:38.367
All you can do is ski.

32:38.447 --> 32:45.097
If you love skiing, you may be willing to accept a smaller salary, a slightly productive university for the sake of that.

32:45.157 --> 32:46.419
Calder, of course, is hardly nearsighted.

32:46.439 --> 32:48.061
He stays inside all winter long.

32:48.441 --> 32:50.224
He's an immensely productive scholar.

32:50.525 --> 32:58.977
And so when he moved to the University of Illinois, they offered him this wonderful chair where he's actually a professor of, instead of being a professor of classics, he's a professor of history of classical scholarship.

32:59.318 --> 33:01.842
And he has this huge slush fund to run these conferences.

33:01.862 --> 33:06.568
He can hire people to come and transcribe documents, and he's incredibly productive.

33:07.069 --> 33:11.416
And he says, well, you know, he felt the University of Illinois had just the advantage that Boulder had for him.

33:11.436 --> 33:15.141
There was nothing else to do there, so he could get an immense number of work done.

33:15.161 --> 33:17.224
This is like old-style Benedictine monks.

33:17.407 --> 33:19.289
You free yourself of the flash.

33:19.329 --> 33:25.696
I mean, Colby's still a gastronome, but you free yourself of lots of other impediments in life, and you can really produce a huge amount of work.

33:26.297 --> 33:30.662
And he's got his own library at home, and I felt University of Illinois was the same for me.

33:30.682 --> 33:37.369
I mean, it was not as though I was there a huge amount of time, but I went to high school there, and it had this library, which is the only redeeming thing.

33:38.050 --> 33:41.874
And once one gets started, I mean, this was a disappointment.

33:41.894 --> 33:42.995
I couldn't get a library card.

33:43.035 --> 33:45.338
I graduated from high school when I was...

33:45.807 --> 33:54.395
16, and you cannot get a library card here until you're, I think you have to be 18 or something to get one at UC, even if you're an ordinary person.

33:54.495 --> 34:00.620
You have to have a driver's license, basically, or be of an age, I think the driver's is 18 here, maybe?

34:00.640 --> 34:01.681
Whatever it was.

34:01.701 --> 34:02.202
Whatever it was.

34:02.282 --> 34:04.844
I went to a provide, of course, I never got a driver's license.

34:04.864 --> 34:05.865
You never got a driver's license?

34:05.885 --> 34:06.726
No, I don't know how to drive.

34:07.006 --> 34:07.767
I don't like cars.

34:08.127 --> 34:09.769
You also spend a lot of time sitting around in cars.

34:10.089 --> 34:10.930
I walk quite well.

34:10.970 --> 34:14.633
Notice I'm one of the very few booksellers who doesn't have a ponch at the age of 45.

34:14.933 --> 34:18.477
I was thinking of many of them.

34:18.798 --> 34:24.485
Peter Howard is in, although he's a bit of a punch, he's in very good shape for a bookseller, because he still schlaps boxes of books.

34:24.505 --> 34:28.089
Most of these people sit at a desk and they have somebody else to do all the dog's body work for them.

34:28.670 --> 34:31.633
And, you know, I can get a fair amount of exercise.

34:31.653 --> 34:32.995
You avoid an immense amount of frustration.

34:33.015 --> 34:40.364
You avoid getting tied, I mean, quite apart from environmental concerns, you get tied up into an AOI one.

34:40.384 --> 34:43.928
There's an interesting book actually written by Monty Holcroft, a non-driver,

34:44.262 --> 34:45.765
called Car Pace.

34:45.785 --> 34:49.153
It's the history of the car in New Zealand from a non-driver's point of view.

34:49.173 --> 34:56.008
And actually, not driving is quite common among book collectors and much more than you would think, probably far higher than the general population.

34:56.650 --> 34:58.434
Roger Ricker at Turtle Island doesn't drive.

34:58.895 --> 35:00.137
Neither does one of their employees.

35:00.177 --> 35:04.026
Now, it's rare in this country, but John Collins at Mags doesn't drive.

35:04.175 --> 35:11.367
And he told me that when he worked in the Sotheby Book Department in the mid-70s, no member of the Sotheby Book Department drove.

35:11.708 --> 35:14.552
Richard Landon at the University of Toronto doesn't drive.

35:14.572 --> 35:15.474
Neither does his wife.

35:15.494 --> 35:17.578
Yeah, and I've known him.

35:17.598 --> 35:18.319
They don't have a car.

35:18.339 --> 35:20.462
Well, of course, he's in Toronto.

35:20.502 --> 35:21.484
He doesn't really need to.

35:21.504 --> 35:22.265
And I'm here in Berkeley.

35:22.285 --> 35:23.067
I can walk to anything.

35:23.087 --> 35:24.289
Oh, there are good stores right by.

35:24.389 --> 35:25.090
One doesn't need to do it.

35:25.331 --> 35:27.614
And my wife does drive and have a car.

35:27.634 --> 35:28.596
But I've just avoided...

35:28.998 --> 35:33.823
Anyway, you just avoid a whole dimension of existence which you don't want to get involved with.

35:33.883 --> 35:35.285
Calder is a non-driver also.

35:35.846 --> 35:42.493
And there's a library of 2,000 books 5,000 miles away, and it sounds not too promising.

35:42.553 --> 35:44.876
Well, I just shrug my shoulders and forget it.

35:44.896 --> 35:47.799
I've got enough for a one-man thing.

35:47.859 --> 35:49.401
I also like things that I can deal with.

35:49.441 --> 35:51.744
Cars I don't have no interest in getting greasy and fixing.

35:52.004 --> 35:54.206
Whereas bookcases, I've built all my own bookcases.

35:54.246 --> 35:55.708
I build bookcases for other booksellers.

35:56.709 --> 35:58.431
In fact, you could spend a fortune...

35:58.647 --> 36:06.119
The bookcases to shell 30,000 books will cost you a very substantial amount of money, possibly more than $30,000.

36:06.279 --> 36:16.335
And if you don't have arbitrary skills... So I don't have... I'm not locked... You certainly...

36:16.889 --> 36:19.112
Do you have an antipathy to the computer?

36:19.152 --> 36:19.612
Yes, I do.

36:19.652 --> 36:26.381
I think, well, I've mentioned a number of examples through both Internet and World Wide Web, which I feel are bad for.

36:26.421 --> 36:27.783
I don't want to ruin my eyesight.

36:27.803 --> 36:28.904
You will notice what happens.

36:29.004 --> 36:31.007
Almost everybody who has a computer has glasses.

36:31.027 --> 36:32.008
Yeah, I don't have glasses yet.

36:32.028 --> 36:33.169
And I had a wonderful, perfect vision.

36:33.209 --> 36:34.331
A perfect vision until you have one.

36:34.391 --> 36:37.915
My father didn't wear glasses until he bought a computer at the age of 60 or something.

36:37.935 --> 36:40.438
I mean, I had fighter pilot eyes.

36:40.458 --> 36:41.159
I mean, I really did.

36:41.179 --> 36:42.221
I wasn't a fighter pilot.

36:42.241 --> 36:46.486
I was in the service because I had to be, but my vision was absolutely perfect.

36:46.526 --> 36:46.626
Yeah.

36:47.028 --> 36:50.152
And now it's, I can't, they're gone.

36:50.172 --> 36:52.114
Well, you see, I want to continue reading books.

36:52.815 --> 36:54.737
And I, you know, it's a ridiculous fact.

36:54.757 --> 37:10.757
I think this whole thing is a, you know, it's made speed up in work and it's destroyed not only Carpool Tunnel, but I, you also have to remember there's one important factor about computers that made them very easily acceptable to most people and not to myself, is that not having grown up with films or television, uh,

37:11.513 --> 37:14.258
To me, a screen has inadequate resolution.

37:14.418 --> 37:20.729
Indeed, much of modern offset printing is inadequate, but a good, solid letterpress is to my ideal resolution.

37:20.990 --> 37:23.214
I'm not used to seeing information on a screen.

37:23.494 --> 37:25.257
To me, it gives me a headache quite rapidly.

37:25.277 --> 37:26.940
Now, most people move from a television...

37:27.241 --> 37:29.204
screen to a computer screen just fine.

37:29.224 --> 37:35.854
I might find one of my objections to computers vanishing if there were some extremely high resolution non-screen.

37:35.994 --> 37:46.189
I think for the database material that you do, especially with all the stuff you put on cards and all the books you've read and all the footnotes, you know, computer technology there would be outstanding.

37:46.209 --> 37:46.609
Yeah, exactly.

37:46.649 --> 37:51.256
But on the other hand, I've started this, you know, I have to retrospectively do 30 years of reading.

37:51.336 --> 37:53.319
Retrospective conversion, they call it.

37:53.519 --> 37:56.083
Yeah, but it's all on his handwriting, not even typed.

37:56.215 --> 38:01.321
Retro, of course, retcon, Nichols and Bacon, I'm sure they've told you what a total fiasco is.

38:01.341 --> 38:03.243
These catalogs are no longer works of scholarship.

38:03.283 --> 38:06.047
The old Library of Congress cards, you could take those for gospel.

38:06.727 --> 38:13.976
These catalogs up here, it's making it easier for the library with budgetary cutbacks and stuff and harder for the person.

38:14.196 --> 38:19.342
You could look up something because it's never been done by anyone with brains.

38:19.683 --> 38:25.389
If they've got a book by Raphael Urciolo written down there, then they have a new one that they've got a catalog by R.G.

38:25.449 --> 38:26.070
Urciolo,

38:26.337 --> 38:29.281
Anyone who knows romance philology might tell you, well, R.G.

38:29.361 --> 38:36.630
Urciolo and Raphael Urciolo are the same person, but some poor hack who just knows how to work a computer doesn't know that, so you end up with two entries.

38:36.650 --> 38:39.514
And if somebody more accomplished, I mean, I've chosen a fairly researche name.

38:40.095 --> 38:44.080
If you've got something fairly complicated, you can find huge long lists.

38:44.100 --> 38:48.025
And if you want to find all the works of Benedetto Croce, for instance, you can spend...

38:48.393 --> 38:57.988
two hours looking through that catalog up there, whereas in the National Union catalog, you could take, you know, he's got a lot of pages because he wrote hundreds of books, but still it's manageable.

38:58.549 --> 39:02.495
And it's just, it's a way of shifting the labor onto someone else.

39:02.555 --> 39:04.799
And so many of these people have no sense of even how to use books.

39:05.119 --> 39:06.321
They can't even use computers.

39:07.042 --> 39:15.075
And I also, of course, a book, you know, well, this is old hat, you must, every computer, anti-computer person must tell you, hires unverified information out there.

39:15.292 --> 39:32.453
and people act as though they either decide, yes, they realize it's all unverified, therefore they assume something written by Nicholas Barker or John Sparrow is also unverified information, or they're used to reading Nicholas Barker, and they realize it's all gospel truth, and they transfer that to the Internet.

39:32.473 --> 39:36.338
I mean, either way, people don't have a critical... There's no editor.

39:38.420 --> 39:43.206
There's no way to distinguish between what's authentic, what's gone through the filtration process,

39:44.030 --> 39:46.013
Oh, it's very suspect.

39:46.033 --> 39:47.515
Listen, I'm going to get my car back.

39:47.816 --> 39:48.257
Okay.

39:48.277 --> 39:53.605
I will tell you in 30 seconds the last thing I meant to say, which is the Lasky quotation.

39:53.625 --> 39:58.172
He described how Lord Acton, you know, who had 100,000... Who's quotation again?

39:58.212 --> 40:00.696
This is Lasky's quotation of Lord Acton.

40:02.559 --> 40:06.966
It's obviously reported to Lasky because Acton died in 1901.

40:07.346 --> 40:08.929
That's what we did finish.

40:09.009 --> 40:09.109
Yeah.

40:09.815 --> 40:17.181
This is, I think, very significant not only to book collecting, to the Internet, hierarchy of information, organizing of information, scholarly practices.

40:17.782 --> 40:39.180
He said that Acton, the club, which is the club that's founded originally by Samuel Johnson, and it continues, with a small membership of fairly learning people, Acton, who, of course, had read everything, Acton would, in support of his opinions, which he had, he would quote, as I do, in fact,

40:39.515 --> 40:46.964
not only giving the work, footnoting, I mean, full documentation, he would quote authorities which his interlocutors did not know.

40:47.644 --> 40:57.376
And he was always vanquished in argument because they were unable to, they had no way of knowing whether the quotation that he gave was from a respectable book or not.

40:57.436 --> 41:02.602
Now, you could have taken it for granted that anything acted says comes from a source that may be taken as gospel, but they didn't know that.

41:02.622 --> 41:04.744
So that gets back to things like Printing of the Mind of Man.

41:05.024 --> 41:08.188
If you quote from Printing of the Mind of Man, it's a known entity.

41:08.523 --> 41:14.893
If you quote from something completely obscure, unless, I mean, people can quote from my catalogs who know me, and some of them occasionally do.

41:15.454 --> 41:18.719
But I realize, you know, there are 125 people in the world who have heard of me, and that's it.

41:18.739 --> 41:22.485
And to a small group, they will say, as Ian Jackson says, such and such.

41:22.525 --> 41:27.072
But to the rest, it's completely lost on them, and they have no idea whether I know what I'm talking about or not.

41:27.452 --> 41:28.774
And Acton's problem is the same way.

41:29.555 --> 41:30.998
How many catalogs have you done?

41:31.418 --> 41:31.699
89.

41:32.500 --> 41:33.502
And how often do you do them?

41:34.703 --> 41:35.745
Whenever I need money.

41:36.147 --> 41:38.610
About three or four years.

41:39.231 --> 41:42.135
Most of my books are actually sold privately.

41:42.155 --> 41:43.016
It's not through the catalogs.

41:43.036 --> 41:44.518
The catalogs are a waste of money and time.

41:44.818 --> 41:52.267
But you see, I entertain a few elderly friends, the 25, and if they die as they're beginning to die, I may quit doing catalogs because they're too much.

41:52.287 --> 41:59.877
I mean, each catalog has $5,000 worth of books in it, which I probably paid $3,000 for, and I make $2,000, and I've spent

42:00.211 --> 42:01.292
I mean, it's a complete money thing.

42:01.512 --> 42:04.495
But it does acquaint certain people with myself.

42:04.555 --> 42:09.300
And booksellers do come and visit my attic and go away with $5,000 worth of books.

42:09.320 --> 42:10.641
And that's where I'd actually make money.

42:10.681 --> 42:12.563
The catalogs, they're to entertain friends.

42:12.963 --> 42:13.784
And yourself.

42:13.864 --> 42:14.485
And yourself.

42:16.627 --> 42:18.829
This is why, actually, these clerishers are probably what God said to me.

42:18.849 --> 42:22.372
Because although I have given away a number of them, I have sold them and made money.

42:22.753 --> 42:28.578
And they provide the same sort of rough entertainment that you might be getting out of my catalogs in a state marketable form.

42:28.618 --> 42:29.239
Otherwise...

42:29.995 --> 42:33.167
You can't sell catalogs, particularly as badly produced as mine.

42:33.187 --> 42:35.435
I'm going to run.

42:35.455 --> 42:37.242
I'm going to get a car back.

42:38.085 --> 42:39.651
I'm flying out tomorrow.
