00:03.271 --> 00:10.100
As the books are closed, by and large, I mean, even collectors tend to keep their books lying around open.

00:10.120 --> 00:13.484
They tend to keep them closed on shelves, in boxes, or whatever.

00:14.966 --> 00:16.688
So they're protected from light.

00:16.708 --> 00:24.958
The other thing is, most of the paintings that we know, most of the pictorial images that we know from museums, are painted in oral painting.

00:25.377 --> 00:28.883
oil painting tends to discolor and tends to cause pigments to darken.

00:29.144 --> 00:37.880
If you look at a 17th century Dutch painting, you'll see that all the green trees are often so dark that they're black, and it's because of chemical changes in the pigment.

00:37.920 --> 00:41.527
With manuscripts, it's a tempera-based, an egg-based paint usually.

00:42.028 --> 00:46.997
For whatever reason, they don't seem to go through that same chemical changes, and you seem to get

00:47.230 --> 00:49.633
I'm quite certain that's true for almost all pigments.

00:50.074 --> 00:51.255
They don't change really at all.

00:51.275 --> 00:55.560
So basically, what you see here probably looks very much like what I looked at the time.

00:55.580 --> 00:57.503
It looks like they could have been done a year ago.

00:58.184 --> 00:59.045
Is the surface vellum?

00:59.345 --> 01:00.807
The surface is vellum.

01:00.827 --> 01:05.613
And vellum itself is a pretty tough substance if it's kept bound in the book.

01:06.114 --> 01:12.782
So books are... I have a friend at the British Library who always says, manuscripts are tough, and that's why they survive, and that's why they look so great.

01:12.965 --> 01:13.907
It's unbelievable.

01:13.987 --> 01:16.111
That's 900 years old.

01:16.692 --> 01:17.835
And it's a great object.

01:17.855 --> 01:29.739
And one of the things I said when we bought the collection to the trustees was, if we buy this collection, we'll be one of the few museums in the world that represents the history of the painting from the early Middle Ages right up to the end of the 19th century.

01:30.580 --> 01:32.003
Most museums don't collect

01:32.590 --> 01:40.004
Manuscripts in most libraries don't collect paintings, so we do something that most institutions don't do.

01:40.024 --> 01:42.229
That's very interesting.

01:42.249 --> 01:44.032
That's interesting.

01:44.172 --> 01:47.298
We have a great Van Gogh and a great autobiography manuscript.

01:47.318 --> 01:49.182
What else is terrific here?

01:49.820 --> 01:53.124
This is German 12-century Steinfeld.

01:53.144 --> 01:54.265
It's a nice example.

01:54.766 --> 01:56.628
It looks like it could be the original binding, too.

01:57.129 --> 01:58.390
Are most of these original bindings?

01:58.410 --> 02:00.233
No, most of them are not, actually.

02:00.273 --> 02:01.374
We have relatively few.

02:01.394 --> 02:03.477
In fact, even this, you can see the binding here.

02:03.957 --> 02:07.522
This is a treasury binding here, which has a metal relief.

02:07.682 --> 02:10.846
The book is 11th century, but the binding is actually 12th century.

02:10.866 --> 02:17.734
So the binding was actually already changed before German.

02:17.714 --> 02:19.997
These are rare, rare.

02:20.157 --> 02:23.702
This is a South Italian miniature.

02:23.722 --> 02:32.193
This is something I bought after Ridley, which are two, which were sold on a sale in 1983.

02:32.413 --> 02:37.360
They're probably made in Sicily or southern Italy.

02:37.863 --> 03:01.322
about by greek or byzantine artists this is this is the boethius manuscript that i was talking about in the show in this particular show we talk about how the apocalypse fits in

03:01.589 --> 03:05.234
to the Middle Ages, the idea that there were certain kinds of vision literature that were popular.

03:05.254 --> 03:07.937
Boethius is essentially about a vision.

03:09.058 --> 03:16.007
Boethius was a Roman statesman who was accused of treason and thrown in jail.

03:16.067 --> 03:19.812
He basically tries to reconcile himself to his fate.

03:19.832 --> 03:22.956
In fact, he was ultimately executed, and this was written about years or

03:23.172 --> 03:24.895
in the last couple of years before he died.

03:24.915 --> 03:36.454
So it consists of a series of dialogue with a woman called philosophy, an abstraction called philosophy, where he debates good and evil and truth and moral and ethical issues.

03:37.456 --> 03:42.985
But this was done in the 15th century by a great French painter, who's known only as the color TV master.

03:44.067 --> 03:49.095
Actually, if you get it, you can see how figures are wonderfully beautifully drawn and painted.

03:49.632 --> 03:53.046
How do you define illumination as opposed to illustration?

03:53.066 --> 03:56.942
I mean, there is a standard definition, I guess, but how do you know of it?

03:57.209 --> 03:59.311
Actually, I tend to use illustration.

03:59.331 --> 04:04.757
All of these essentially are illustrations, but I think it's sort of from the technical point of view.

04:04.857 --> 04:11.184
I tend to use illustration for printed books and illumination for painting or painted decoration in books.

04:12.065 --> 04:15.849
Frankly, the tradition of illumination pretty much dies out by the end of the 16th century.

04:16.489 --> 04:22.455
We actually have some 17th century illumination that's no longer actually a major and important art form.

04:22.475 --> 04:24.938
It no longer attracts the great artists of the period.

04:25.441 --> 04:28.925
So you can also sort of demarcate it chronologically pretty much.

04:29.306 --> 04:35.994
But you generally distinguish the two as the illustration being in the printed book and the illumination being in the manuscripts.

04:36.014 --> 04:36.555
Yeah, exactly.

04:36.575 --> 04:39.419
Because the illumination in manuscripts tends to be painted decoration.

04:39.919 --> 04:43.324
I mean, it is... I'm very pleased.

04:43.344 --> 04:49.091
It took me years to... I had to pursue these things for years.

04:50.453 --> 04:53.777
It was a private... Oh, thank you.

04:54.365 --> 05:06.647
This artist we know is a painter as well.

05:06.667 --> 05:08.550
There's a painting in the Louvre.

05:08.630 --> 05:12.697
There's only one painting that survives by.

05:13.258 --> 05:18.347
There's a painting in the Louvre, there's a set of drawings for tapestry designs that he did, which are major monumental works.

05:18.614 --> 05:21.539
but most of the painted work that survives his influx.

05:21.860 --> 05:23.202
Now how do you... did he sign these?

05:23.222 --> 05:26.528
Did he sign or did he just determine... I signed Curly on Stylist and Laces.

05:26.549 --> 05:38.310
We do have some circumstantial documentary evidence that suggests that these books were... that artists, specific known artists,

05:38.746 --> 06:06.762
was this artist but we have no sign they as a rule did not sign their stuff so usually you need a documented book which is pretty rare or some strong circumstantial evidence but were any of these done in teams you know where we had a number of writers working on the same question i'll tell you what is likely is that the borders were often and initials were often painted by a different artist um it's perfectly and we actually i know of a miniature or two in our collection where it's clear by looking at it that there were two artists working on it but

06:07.248 --> 06:11.253
We just don't know enough about it.

06:11.274 --> 06:14.017
The degree of collaboration in a miniature itself is hard to determine.

06:14.037 --> 06:15.599
I think these are probably all there.

06:15.619 --> 06:22.889
There's a kind of consistency in the way they're painting.

06:22.909 --> 06:24.452
Were they removed from text?

06:24.972 --> 06:26.995
They would have been in a book about this big.

06:27.683 --> 06:31.608
And in itself, the text in itself was very interesting.

06:31.628 --> 06:37.835
There was this bizarre fashion in the 15th century to have certain texts written in both Latin and French.

06:38.356 --> 06:41.379
And this book was written, the text was written in Latin and in French.

06:41.399 --> 06:43.502
And in addition, there was a commentary on the text.

06:44.082 --> 06:54.254
And because there were all these different texts running simultaneously, which essentially you were supposed to consult at the same time, some of the, there are other copies of this that I've looked at.

06:54.274 --> 06:55.716
There are the columns that,

06:56.253 --> 07:02.340
The texts themselves are arranged in these strange columns, and they sometimes curve in and out because it's so complicated.

07:02.360 --> 07:12.032
They made the sort of text pages into a kind of beautifully designed ensemble so that they were nice to look at and not too intimidated because it was complicated.

07:12.052 --> 07:13.995
It was weird, actually.

07:14.936 --> 07:17.279
Do you think they have been removed from the text?

07:17.459 --> 07:18.680
I have no idea.

07:18.700 --> 07:24.768
For reasons that would be difficult to give, probably in the 20th century.

07:24.948 --> 07:25.669
Probably...

07:26.628 --> 07:31.015
Maybe in the early 20th century, but it's hard to know.

07:31.877 --> 07:33.039
That's the wheel of fortune, yeah.

07:33.159 --> 07:38.729
And if you look at the woman, if you look at the very back of her head, there's a dark face as well.

07:38.749 --> 07:40.832
Fortune is sort of up and down, good and bad.

07:41.714 --> 07:42.635
Good luck and bad luck.

07:42.655 --> 07:42.916
Right.

07:43.096 --> 07:43.857
Good and evil.

07:43.998 --> 07:46.522
And she has both faces because fortune has two faces.

07:46.562 --> 07:47.904
That detail is so fine.

07:47.964 --> 07:48.906
I can't do that.

07:51.164 --> 08:05.288
The other thing, of course, is the patrons of these people, they were employed by the kings of France and the dukes and duchesses at the court, where all the money and power was, was where these artists worked.

08:05.328 --> 08:08.774
So at the very top of the society, and artists like this were also part of the household.

08:10.016 --> 08:16.767
They were employees of the royal household or the ducal household or whatever.

08:17.843 --> 08:25.953
This is the Roman de la Rose.

08:26.554 --> 08:29.838
Do you know this text?

08:29.858 --> 08:30.058
No.

08:30.339 --> 08:32.481
This is one of the great medieval texts.

08:32.501 --> 08:42.754
Roman de la Rose was an allegory of the search for love, and it was one of the really popular texts in the later Middle Ages, and it was also popular for artists.

08:43.696 --> 08:49.325
There are probably more than 100 copies, illuminated copies, which is a lot of this text.

08:49.385 --> 08:52.249
There are many, many more copies that weren't illuminated.

08:52.269 --> 08:55.515
Actually, artistically, this is one of the finest ones.

08:55.775 --> 09:00.603
It's probably from Paris from the beginning of the 15th century.

09:00.623 --> 09:03.567
Do the illuminations correspond to the text?

09:03.587 --> 09:05.350
Very closely.

09:06.005 --> 09:08.750
And the story is of a dream.

09:09.191 --> 09:13.980
And in fact, this shows that this is the story of, I forget what he's called, the lover in the book.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.965
And he goes to bed, and in his bed, he begins to have a dream.

09:16.985 --> 09:21.253
So it starts right with the beginning of the text.

09:21.273 --> 09:23.457
And it's nice because it's not, they're not,

09:23.774 --> 09:26.919
of a religious nature, and this is one of the lines.

09:26.959 --> 09:29.643
Most of the great books are religious.

09:29.963 --> 09:32.007
And in fact, that's an interesting point.

09:32.027 --> 09:42.022
It's incredibly hard to get good secular manuscripts, and if there's one area where I'd like to do better, is to get a great illustrated Dante or something, I mean, to get a wonderful secular, some more wonderful secular manuscripts.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.846
They're just really hard to find at this point.

09:45.988 --> 09:48.752
This is the very few I've ever seen.

09:49.036 --> 09:52.543
Is it such a romance from the early 15th century?

09:52.563 --> 09:55.569
Yeah, it's a German book, actually.

09:55.749 --> 09:56.070
Great.

09:56.651 --> 10:00.058
This is one of the book's manuscripts.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.585
This was probably his greatest manuscript.

10:03.906 --> 10:06.150
I think, actually, maybe I sent you the book about this.

10:06.250 --> 10:07.613
I recognize it, yeah.

10:07.873 --> 10:09.677
This is called The Visions of Tanda.

10:09.927 --> 10:14.397
In the Middle Ages, another popular genre of vision literature was about visions of hell.

10:15.019 --> 10:26.265
And actually they were kind of fun stories because some spoiled knight, you know, in this story he becomes ill at a dinner party and goes into a coma and there he has his vision.

10:26.617 --> 10:33.630
And then he's carried through hell and he has all these kinds of adventures where he's attacked by monsters and beasts nominally because he's committed this sin or that sin.

10:33.670 --> 10:36.014
And he's, in a sense, punished already for his sins.

10:36.415 --> 10:42.145
And all of this is a kind of warning that if you don't clean up your act, you're in big trouble.

10:42.428 --> 10:48.478
But this is interesting.

10:48.878 --> 10:50.320
This was also very, very popular.

10:50.340 --> 10:53.045
We know that this text was translated into 15 languages.

10:53.165 --> 10:57.371
It was written in the 12th century and was still popular in the 15th century when this book was made.

10:58.193 --> 11:02.800
There are versions in Icelandic and there are several versions in Italian.

11:03.168 --> 11:04.109
It was best-seller.

11:04.129 --> 11:07.652
But this is the only non-illuminated copy.

11:08.013 --> 11:13.018
So why was the Roman de la Rose illuminated over and over and over again and everybody had a copy?

11:13.038 --> 11:16.862
And this was an equally popular text, but it was never realistic.

11:18.703 --> 11:21.406
I don't know.

11:21.426 --> 11:25.330
This stuff is extraordinary.

11:25.450 --> 11:29.174
Actually, this is a new book because we do have a document for this book.

11:29.194 --> 11:30.255
This is one of the few

11:30.488 --> 11:33.191
a relatively human evil book that is very well documented.

11:33.531 --> 11:38.056
The payments survive for the scribe, and the artist, and the binding.

11:38.697 --> 11:40.039
The binding actually is lost.

11:40.279 --> 11:47.367
The book was done in 1469, and the binding is probably early 16th century, so already it got damaged.

11:47.387 --> 11:48.248
It must have been used a lot.

11:48.628 --> 11:51.751
You see, the calligraphy in this book is spectacular.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.194
This was the greatest of all the Burgundian scribes.

11:54.234 --> 11:57.398
His name was Nicholas Spierink, and he worked for the Dukes of Burgundy.

11:57.458 --> 11:59.500
This book, in fact, was made for Charles the Bold.

11:59.480 --> 12:01.965
in 1469, shortly after he became Duke.

12:02.366 --> 12:04.470
So, we have the documents.

12:04.490 --> 12:05.572
You have the documents?

12:05.592 --> 12:08.698
Well, they're in the archives in Brussels, but I mean, they exist.

12:11.042 --> 12:12.966
The artist is named Levin Finlantham.

12:13.233 --> 12:19.385
And in the documents, he's actually paid for completing the book and for taking it and delivering it to the binder in The Hague.

12:19.405 --> 12:26.860
So he went from, I think it was Gantt or Brussels or something, to The Hague.

12:26.880 --> 12:34.515
And he was paid a lot of money.

12:34.951 --> 12:43.161
And for some reason, one of the things that's interesting about manuscript illumination is in Northern Europe, it was always a greater art form than in Italy.

12:43.422 --> 12:50.190
In Italy, by this point, by 1469, you have your Renaissance, you have the Botticelli and, you know, Frangelico and your great artists.

12:50.210 --> 12:57.159
Although you have the Antoinette at this time, the volume of great and important painting going on in Italy is far more than in the North.

12:57.600 --> 13:01.785
But manuscript illumination as an original and vital and major art form

13:02.542 --> 13:05.171
is more important in the north in places like this.

13:05.191 --> 13:09.868
So these artists were very successful and they were very well played and they were among the best artists going on.

13:10.203 --> 13:14.690
He used two different color inks in the polygraphy.

13:14.730 --> 13:17.214
There's blue one and black.

13:17.314 --> 13:19.076
And it was all meant to be beautiful and sumptuous.

13:19.097 --> 13:21.680
One of the unfortunate things is the book is trimmed a little at the top.

13:21.700 --> 13:22.722
I think you can see that.

13:23.163 --> 13:28.431
Probably a little more space around it, the effect of all these flourishes would be even more elegant.

13:28.611 --> 13:31.195
But it was a prayer book, and so it had to be small.

13:31.235 --> 13:33.639
Small and personal, yeah, exactly.

13:33.659 --> 13:39.147
And there are three pictures of the Duke praying in here, and his name appears in the book.

13:39.430 --> 13:44.197
The thing is, these were meant to function as much as this particular book was a functional book.

13:44.217 --> 13:44.778
Is that right?

13:45.920 --> 13:46.941
Yes.

13:47.021 --> 13:48.444
In theory, yes.

13:48.804 --> 13:55.494
But one of the interesting things is, and I'll show you this when we get on sources, the number of the books that we required are in amazing condition.

13:55.694 --> 14:01.423
You can't imagine that they were overhandled, except maybe once a month to show to your uncle or something like that.

14:01.643 --> 14:08.053
So one wonders if they didn't have these items really primarily as prestige items,

14:08.371 --> 14:17.243
and have, in fact, a fair book that they used that was dog-eared and had no illustrations or something, or became so heavily used that it was eventually discarded.

14:17.964 --> 14:23.972
It's an interesting... I mean, they were functional in the purest sense, but whether in practice is hard to know.

14:24.052 --> 14:27.356
But as you said, they had to rebind quite a number of them as well.

14:27.376 --> 14:29.939
Well, in this case, that's true, actually.

14:30.020 --> 14:35.987
And this book looks a bit more worn than some of the... And yet the eliminations stand up, which is extraordinary.

14:36.408 --> 14:37.990
That's one of the great things.

14:38.493 --> 14:44.240
Let's go downstairs.

14:44.900 --> 14:47.283
This is the Spinal Hours.

14:47.343 --> 15:05.884
This is this manuscript, which was completely unrecorded until 1976, when apparently a German, some German, a travel agent or something, bought it wrapped in newspaper or brown paper or something like that into the office at Sotheby's there and said he wanted to sell it.

15:06.370 --> 15:08.952
And it's probably one of the great books of the 16th century.

15:09.673 --> 15:12.996
And I think what I may have to do is I'll show you some slides for it when we get on.

15:13.076 --> 15:19.922
It says it has 88 miniatures and has all kinds of fantastic illusionism and crazy things.

15:19.982 --> 15:23.185
This is a very rare example where both pages were used for one miniature.

15:23.285 --> 15:26.388
It's the Adoration of a Lamb who sort of gets lost in the gutter there.

15:27.109 --> 15:32.053
It came into Sotheby's and that binding and that condition is amazing.

15:32.313 --> 15:36.377
In fact, the interesting thing is not to sort of belabor the point, but

15:36.830 --> 15:41.117
I have to say that since we bought this, well, we bought it, it was even whiter and purer and cleaner.

15:41.497 --> 15:43.741
And when we first bought it, everybody wanted to see it in the world.

15:44.081 --> 15:46.084
And any distinguished scholar who wanted to see it, you let them see it.

15:46.645 --> 15:50.692
And we soon found that it actually didn't take very many people to handle it before the pages would yellow.

15:50.712 --> 15:52.675
So now we make people wear gloves when they handle it.

15:53.115 --> 15:54.357
It's still in wonderful condition.

15:54.397 --> 15:55.800
It's all relative.

15:55.820 --> 15:58.424
But it doesn't take much to make a book go yellow.

15:59.225 --> 16:01.549
And I think it's 15, about 15, 15.

16:01.569 --> 16:01.709
Yeah.

16:02.130 --> 16:05.014
And it's one of the first majors in cinemascope.

16:06.040 --> 16:09.645
Anyway.

16:09.685 --> 16:16.874
As I said, he had great Flemish manuscripts.

16:16.894 --> 16:22.961
The last book we looked right upstairs, the Spinella Hours, which was a two-page manuscript, that's one of the great Flemish ones.

16:23.021 --> 16:25.725
This is another one of the manuscript, which is the History of Alexander.

16:26.746 --> 16:31.512
And actually, the great patrons of this period were Philip the Good and Charles the Bold.

16:31.572 --> 16:32.453
And this was a text.

16:33.007 --> 16:36.631
that was commissioned, a translation that was commissioned by Charles the Bold, who's shown here.

16:36.671 --> 16:38.153
And there are many copies.

16:38.213 --> 16:41.817
In fact, this was one of the popular manuscripts that people at his court would buy.

16:42.238 --> 16:43.680
He loved Alexander the Great.

16:43.700 --> 16:46.263
He saw Alexander as being one of his heroes and models.

16:47.124 --> 16:53.692
And then his courtiers would then buy, commission copies of the book for themselves so they could have the same books that the Duke had.

16:54.613 --> 16:57.877
It was really, it was a fashion.

16:57.897 --> 16:59.959
And it was this sort of fashion for illuminated books

17:00.580 --> 17:08.489
a sort of glorious and prestigious items, and also because they told sort of adventurous stories, that was partially responsible for the flowering of this at the time.

17:09.110 --> 17:12.634
So, anyway, so... But look, there's not any chipping at all anywhere.

17:12.874 --> 17:17.199
I mean, I don't see any evidence of any... But there has been one bit of fudging.

17:17.239 --> 17:18.120
Can you guess what that is?

17:19.061 --> 17:20.563
Well... The book's been meddled with.

17:21.183 --> 17:23.686
It has been, huh?

17:23.706 --> 17:24.287
I can't see it.

17:24.307 --> 17:29.693
Okay, well, you might not guess it, but if you look here, you'll see the red...

17:30.179 --> 17:31.581
There was a rubric.

17:31.601 --> 17:32.722
There was writing in there.

17:32.742 --> 17:34.064
There was some kind of a dedication.

17:34.945 --> 17:38.489
In fact, someone later covered it over in gold.

17:38.630 --> 17:45.618
And I think actually this is where, this book was probably made for a member of the Kauai family, which is one of the great families at the Ducal Court.

17:45.899 --> 17:51.185
And I think that we've never actually been able to decipher it entirely, but it probably makes some reference.

17:51.245 --> 17:52.807
Have you tried to do x-rays work?

17:52.827 --> 17:53.768
Yeah, we've tried everything.

17:53.788 --> 17:54.970
It just doesn't come out fairly.

17:54.990 --> 17:55.971
Whose seal is that?

17:55.991 --> 17:59.055
Is that that little seal there, I wonder?

17:59.440 --> 18:00.922
That's a good question.

18:00.962 --> 18:02.104
That's a previous owner.

18:02.164 --> 18:03.686
Well, obviously, there's a royal owner.

18:07.291 --> 18:09.894
I'll show you some of the other pictures.

18:09.914 --> 18:10.435
I don't even know that.

18:10.635 --> 18:13.059
There are about 15 of them.

18:13.079 --> 18:15.502
So this is the birth of Alexander.

18:17.965 --> 18:18.807
And we get his exports.

18:18.827 --> 18:24.675
And, of course, the great thing for us is that they told these stories in terms of their own time.

18:24.695 --> 18:27.579
So they were costumes of their own day.

18:27.859 --> 18:28.620
So what you see is

18:28.887 --> 18:34.275
how the Gundyans dressed, not how Alexander dressed, not how the Macedonians dressed.

18:34.295 --> 18:35.837
And this is circa what, did you say?

18:35.877 --> 18:40.864
This is about 14, after 1475, maybe, probably not later than 1480.

18:42.847 --> 18:42.927
Wow.

18:44.749 --> 18:45.851
It was one of the great eras.

18:45.931 --> 18:48.054
And which, what was the name of this one again?

18:48.074 --> 18:49.877
This is called the History of Alexander the Great.

18:49.897 --> 18:50.237
Okay.

18:56.512 --> 19:10.112
Did all of these have pretty good provenance?

19:10.492 --> 19:19.685
Yes, actually, I would say, as a rule, if you look through the provenances, you'll find that they all came from Beatty or Bison Perrins or Yates Thompson.

19:19.766 --> 19:22.890
They're always, you see, it always seems like

19:23.174 --> 19:26.759
The great collectors of illuminated manuscripts are relatively few and relatively well-known.

19:27.059 --> 19:31.225
Almost all of them have their collections catalogued, and you can often trace these back.

19:31.245 --> 19:32.887
This book, you can't, actually.

19:32.907 --> 19:38.635
This one doesn't have much of a colonoscopy, but most of them do.

19:39.677 --> 19:49.971
Actually, we don't buy that much stuff that doesn't have some kind of a pedigree, not so much by design as just by that seems to be the way it is.

19:49.991 --> 19:52.354
The sphenola was an exception, although the sphenola, ours,

19:52.587 --> 19:54.630
upstairs, although we didn't know where it was.

19:54.670 --> 19:56.653
The coup ended in 1976.

19:56.693 --> 19:59.296
The binding is an 18th century binding of the Spinella family.

20:00.278 --> 20:11.854
And the Spinella family is an identical binding with the Spinella photovances on the Tres-Ris-sur of the Duc de Berry, which is perhaps the most famous of all of the manuscripts.

20:11.874 --> 20:13.676
So they, at one time, were in the same family.

20:18.403 --> 20:19.604
My glasses can't pick out.

20:19.724 --> 20:20.606
Is that a pencil marker?

20:20.626 --> 20:22.408
That's a modern foliation, yeah.

20:23.114 --> 20:25.117
There's the original foliation.

20:25.137 --> 20:25.858
That's what, 180, 190.

20:26.078 --> 20:29.302
That's unbelievable.

20:31.004 --> 20:33.067
It really is.

20:33.928 --> 20:34.589
Magnificent.

20:37.693 --> 20:38.474
Just a little Bible.

20:49.007 --> 20:49.628
Very much thank you.

20:50.030 --> 20:59.699
Because I think also, I mean, in the case of the kind of the text, I mean, the Duke really saw Alexander the Great as his great forerunner, because he also saw himself as a conqueror.

21:00.039 --> 21:11.529
So there was real political meaning to the choice of text and all that.

21:11.549 --> 21:16.573
This is another great... We'll use our gloves for this one, I guess.

21:16.614 --> 21:18.315
Yeah, and it took us off like a temple a lot.

21:18.886 --> 21:30.719
Um, and this was actually a Rothschild manuscript, and it was in, uh, and it was at Palmersfelden as well, the Counts of Schönborn, so it has a very distinguished provenance.

21:31.359 --> 21:32.721
And we know who it was made for.

21:32.741 --> 21:35.304
It was made for Albrecht of Brandenburg.

21:35.344 --> 21:47.577
Brandenburg was one of, uh, actually, Brandenburg was the guy who was the Archbishop of, uh, I guess, Mainz when the famous theses of, uh, Martin Luther were tacked on the

21:48.265 --> 22:01.518
on the cathedral at Worms, and it really wasn't the protest of what people like Brandenburg were doing, which was spending their money on good living and great artists and fancy books and selling indulgences to pay for them.

22:01.918 --> 22:02.419
Look at that.

22:02.439 --> 22:03.640
That's the Brandenburg Code of Arms.

22:06.643 --> 22:10.867
And as I say, he had paintings by Dror and Grunewald and most of the great German artists.

22:12.088 --> 22:16.973
And this book he particularly loved, and he also commissioned a couple of German artists to make copies of it.

22:17.138 --> 22:24.845
The book is also, it's one of the rare medieval manuscripts that exist in copies where all the illuminations are copied as well as the text.

22:24.985 --> 22:26.426
How many illuminations in that book?

22:26.646 --> 22:30.550
It says, I think it's 39 or 40.

22:30.970 --> 22:33.372
How long do you think it would take to produce one of those?

22:33.392 --> 22:35.094
Did you ever give them any thought?

22:35.394 --> 22:35.834
No idea.

22:36.495 --> 22:46.143
Yeah, people ask this question all the time, and I think a book like this probably would have, it's hard to know how fast they actually worked, and it depended to some extent on how many artists were involved.

22:46.163 --> 22:47.044
In this case, I think,

22:47.362 --> 22:49.125
It looks like the artist painted everything.

22:49.625 --> 22:52.690
It might have taken a year.

22:53.731 --> 22:54.633
But we really don't know.

22:54.853 --> 22:55.794
That's just a guess.

22:57.817 --> 22:58.418
Extraordinary.

22:59.540 --> 23:06.510
But it would be difficult to find a painting, let's say by a contemporary painting, like Bernard von Orly or Quentin Metzise, who's one of the great Flemish artists.

23:06.530 --> 23:08.453
You couldn't find a painting by them in this condition.

23:08.994 --> 23:09.935
Find a bigger object.

23:11.057 --> 23:13.881
But you couldn't find something that's splendidly preserved.

23:14.241 --> 23:14.702
Exquisite.

23:19.120 --> 23:20.322
Excuse me a second.

23:20.342 --> 23:22.184
It's really something.

23:22.424 --> 23:22.885
Thank you.

23:25.769 --> 23:30.335
We'll go to the... Now, the most beautiful miniatures are actually at the end of The Passion of Christ.

23:40.409 --> 23:41.270
Oh, God.

23:42.732 --> 23:47.338
Oh, God.

23:49.023 --> 23:52.748
I mean, the early 16th century is still considered to be a major period for Flemish painting.

23:53.389 --> 23:57.275
But when we talk about Flemish painting in the textbooks, they don't talk about Flemish manuscripts.

23:57.295 --> 24:02.583
But from our mind, the quality of the originality of it is as great.

24:07.089 --> 24:08.511
What did you call this one again?

24:08.972 --> 24:15.722
This is called the Pro Book of Albrecht for Bannenberg.

24:20.731 --> 24:23.254
Something that even we, in a sense, haven't figured out how to resolve.

24:23.714 --> 24:30.562
This is a book that does tell us, it's a pro-book, and it has different pros which have been related to the story of the Passion, the story of Christ.

24:32.183 --> 24:34.105
But it tells a continuous narrative.

24:34.125 --> 24:43.636
And in fact, as a work of art, I discovered when I first looked at this at the Ludwig's house, as you go through it and you turn the pages and you see this sort of Christ going through all this, it actually is a very, very moving story.

24:43.656 --> 24:48.561
I mean, it's called an incredible detail, and you see Christ is represented as a very sort of sympathetic and very human figure.

24:48.895 --> 24:55.544
And it really works on a certain aesthetic level from the handling of the book and the turning of the pages looking like the images.

24:55.984 --> 25:01.552
But, of course, in the museum, in the gallery camp, there's no way you can turn the pages to people.

25:01.852 --> 25:03.614
How did Ludwig present these?

25:03.715 --> 25:05.417
As books in a library?

25:05.437 --> 25:08.140
Or did he have them... He just kept them stored on shelves.

25:08.220 --> 25:13.127
And so I don't know the extent to which he... He didn't actually have any in the house.

25:14.308 --> 25:14.849
Sorry.

25:14.869 --> 25:15.710
Oh, okay.

25:15.770 --> 25:18.514
Is this a copy we can...

25:18.882 --> 25:19.323
Yeah.

25:19.343 --> 25:20.003
OK.

25:20.083 --> 25:23.267
Is that what you want to discuss?

25:23.287 --> 25:26.711
Yeah, is that what you want to think?

25:26.731 --> 25:28.513
So I don't know how he actually handled them.

25:28.794 --> 25:33.259
He actually didn't, as I say, kept them mostly stored in the museum in Cologne.

25:33.519 --> 25:36.883
I think actually he did live with art.

25:36.903 --> 25:39.647
I mean, there was a terrific Rauschenberg hanging in his bedroom.

25:40.167 --> 25:41.809
I mean, there were objects all over the house.

25:41.889 --> 25:43.772
I mean, he definitely lived with the objects.

25:44.152 --> 25:46.695
But how he lived with the books is less clear to me.

25:46.895 --> 25:59.448
I felt, I mean, it's how it's corny to say this, but the first time I looked at it, it was profoundly moving, you know?

25:59.468 --> 26:06.135
There aren't that many works of art that you could look at that, in a sense, really, you found very moving.

26:06.155 --> 26:12.582
But this was one, Christ was always trying to say, this is a very sort of vulnerable, very human sort of figure.

26:20.273 --> 26:33.150
There's also a period when, in the literature of the time, and in the whole devotional practice, the whole culture of this period, the idea was that you were supposed to empathize with Christ in this very powerful way and identify with his suffering.

26:33.471 --> 26:47.850
And so, even when it borders on the somewhat graphic, the point is to draw in the devout, the reader, the viewer, into a story that's very powerful and very moving.

26:48.252 --> 26:58.227
And it works, actually, and it's very remarkable.

26:58.347 --> 27:01.632
It's a great object.

27:01.652 --> 27:02.313
Isn't that wonderful?

27:02.333 --> 27:03.235
Well, 1530.

27:04.537 --> 27:05.518
Yeah, 1520 o'clock.

27:13.278 --> 27:16.922
So this competed with printing, to a degree.

27:16.942 --> 27:20.786
I guess printing for a period, right?

27:21.206 --> 27:32.197
Yeah, there was this funny, famous story about Federico de Montefalto, where he said that he wouldn't have any printed books in his library, that he took the printed books and had them copied into manuscripts and brought printed books.

27:32.457 --> 27:35.020
I mean, there was initially this kind of reaction against printing.

27:35.040 --> 27:38.283
I mean, eventually, actually, 1530 is fairly late.

27:38.323 --> 27:43.268
There are relatively few great artists left working, and by actually the middle of the century,

27:44.142 --> 27:46.545
The great aluminum manuscripts that are produced are really oddballs.

27:46.886 --> 27:50.010
By then, the illustrated printing book is much more important.

27:50.030 --> 27:53.614
So, in a sense, this belongs to one of the last great objects of the tradition.

27:55.016 --> 28:03.347
But, I mean, for 50 years, well, the Gutenberg Bibles of the 1450s, so for, I would say, 75 or 80 years after that, it's still a very serious art form.

28:03.367 --> 28:04.488
It still sort of hangs in there.

28:05.690 --> 28:08.854
But these books are made for the emperor, the king, the duke.

28:09.955 --> 28:11.938
Who is it that wouldn't have a printed book?

28:12.458 --> 28:17.744
I think it was Federico de Montecaltro was the famous... No, no, no, that's fine.

28:17.885 --> 28:19.827
I'm going to get up anyway.

28:19.887 --> 28:20.668
I just want to make sure.

28:20.688 --> 28:21.148
Can you see?

28:22.070 --> 28:34.184
Yeah, it's just so beautiful.

28:34.204 --> 28:36.627
That's a nice little story.

28:37.670 --> 28:39.112
I'll see if I can actually dig it out.

28:39.212 --> 28:40.794
I think it's written somewhere.

28:40.814 --> 28:43.638
That's the kind of stuff I like.

28:43.698 --> 28:44.659
I can use it, you know.

28:49.585 --> 28:50.807
That's just nice.

28:50.867 --> 28:52.109
It's magnificent.

28:52.730 --> 28:57.696
It took me a week to go through it.

28:57.716 --> 28:58.497
Look at the sky.

28:58.817 --> 28:59.478
Look at the sky.

29:00.520 --> 29:00.920
Never mind.

29:00.980 --> 29:04.945
I mean, he's got the textures there and the clouds and the bricks.

29:05.907 --> 29:06.968
I mean, working...

29:07.117 --> 29:09.240
What kind of brushes did they have?

29:09.300 --> 29:14.548
There is actually a famous self book that I've had late in his life where he's wearing glasses, actually.

29:14.568 --> 29:17.954
He probably says something about the patterns.

29:18.234 --> 29:19.396
But they must have used very fun.

29:19.476 --> 29:33.057
I mean, the sort of proverbial one-hair brush or something like it must have been used to be... Anyway, so these are... So this, this phenol... The Alexander the Great, the ones we just looked at,

29:34.117 --> 29:38.721
are things that were in Ludwig.

29:38.741 --> 29:43.345
I'll show you some Flemish things that we have since then.

29:46.148 --> 29:47.349
Number 20.

29:47.369 --> 30:03.504
Looking at number 20.

30:03.524 --> 30:03.904
This is

30:04.880 --> 30:11.167
This one here?

30:11.868 --> 30:12.829
Yep.

30:12.849 --> 30:14.151
It's called a model book of calligraphy.

30:14.171 --> 30:20.318
That's what we call it in English.

30:20.338 --> 30:21.079
Now, what is this?

30:21.299 --> 30:28.447
The history of this book is, this is a model book of calligraphy, which also has an interesting, rather bizarre story.

30:29.128 --> 30:31.731
The text, every page is a different calligraphic sample.

30:32.412 --> 30:33.553
And the whole sort of,

30:34.208 --> 30:44.339
genre of model books of this type, grows up from the fact that in the 16th century, once printing press begins to take hold, people want to learn how to read, and they want to learn how to write.

30:45.040 --> 30:49.905
Now that that grows a desire to have books about calligraphy and different styles of writing so that people can learn them.

30:49.985 --> 30:51.667
So they were essentially educational tools.

30:52.408 --> 30:59.796
And then within that genre, there goes out a sort of mini genre of deluxe model books of calligraphy, which were also showpieces.

31:00.256 --> 31:03.760
So this was done by the court secretary of the emperor Ferdinand I,

31:04.043 --> 31:12.351
in Vienna as a kind of show-off piece to show how good he was, an elegant manuscript for the emperor.

31:14.474 --> 31:29.248
Ferdinand's grandson, Rudolf II, was one of the great art patrons of Central Europe at the end of the 16th century, then took the book and commissioned an artist at his court about 30 years later to add the decoration.

31:29.789 --> 31:32.852
So the book was made, actually, in two campaigns.

31:33.119 --> 31:34.441
And that was declared that much later.

31:34.461 --> 31:37.406
30 years, though.

31:37.646 --> 31:40.250
So they just left the thing in storage all that time waiting for it?

31:40.270 --> 31:40.851
Well, I should know.

31:40.871 --> 31:44.136
He probably looked at it and showed it to his friends and everything.

31:44.357 --> 31:47.161
Because a beautiful holographic model would have been as well.

31:47.181 --> 31:51.388
What if they left space for the illustrations, though?

31:51.408 --> 31:52.009
Yeah, exactly.

31:52.029 --> 31:54.633
Well, it's not clear, actually, what was intended.

31:55.614 --> 31:57.497
But I suspect, yeah, I think that's probably true.

31:57.717 --> 32:00.021
But we don't know for sure.

32:00.490 --> 32:05.355
And what he did, the artist did this brilliant job of sort of making the two work as one image.

32:07.477 --> 32:12.942
And certainly the calligraphy is there, and they left... And there was a space, yeah.

32:13.122 --> 32:17.186
But it was intended, it probably was intended, actually, but it's hard to, one can always wear the space.

32:17.206 --> 32:17.866
Oh, sure, look at that.

32:19.108 --> 32:20.669
I mean, where the calligraphy comes down.

32:23.131 --> 32:26.294
It's almost as if the calligrapher worked with the artist, almost.

32:26.314 --> 32:28.717
Well, it seems like it seems like.

32:28.737 --> 32:29.097
Yeah, almost.

32:29.414 --> 32:37.645
Anything with words is part of the original, and all these little flourishes in the same color.

32:38.085 --> 32:44.454
That's all part of the written thing.

32:45.315 --> 32:51.403
Are all the illustrations flowers, fruits, botany type things?

32:51.423 --> 32:52.604
Well, actually not all, but most.

32:53.005 --> 32:54.527
Look at that.

32:55.199 --> 32:57.322
Unless you said it's Flemish, I think, is that right?

32:57.342 --> 32:58.343
Well, it's interesting.

32:58.384 --> 33:06.115
It was made by Gerard Kufnaga, who was an artist from Antwerp, and it's essentially a Flemish artist, but who worked at the Habsburg Court in Munich in Vienna.

33:06.976 --> 33:13.465
And the book was written by a Croatian artist who was working in Vienna and illuminated by a Flemish artist working in Vienna.

33:13.485 --> 33:14.386
So we call it Flemish.

33:14.406 --> 33:15.969
You have a pretty good history on it, don't you?

33:16.049 --> 33:18.893
Yeah, it's exceptionally well documented.

33:18.913 --> 33:20.455
That is really extraordinary.

33:20.475 --> 33:21.176
Isn't that something?

33:21.196 --> 33:21.797
Yeah.

33:21.963 --> 33:24.225
I mean, I've been going to all the sales in New York.

33:24.285 --> 33:25.567
I haven't seen anything like that.

33:25.587 --> 33:29.311
Well, believe me, Stephen comes to the sales room.

33:30.532 --> 33:31.633
This was sort of chased.

33:32.114 --> 33:33.275
Oh, here, now, this is fun.

33:33.295 --> 33:34.696
This is a mirror writing.

33:35.397 --> 33:38.600
Leonardo used to write in mirror writing, which is basically just backwards.

33:38.620 --> 33:40.943
Yeah, why would he include it just as a sample?

33:40.963 --> 33:47.630
It's just a sample of another type of writing, another sort of... It's basically a sort of show-off piece.

33:50.553 --> 33:50.653
So...

33:56.742 --> 34:06.258
There are many that exist, but very few with terrific illuminations.

34:06.278 --> 34:12.188
Also, most often the calligraphic model books were printed, and there are many printed examples.

34:12.889 --> 34:22.125
And there are actually book collectors, there are lots of calligraphic models that exist without, most of the decoration is with pen flourishes, not with painting.

34:22.578 --> 34:24.079
You know who collected those?

34:24.220 --> 34:24.540
Peeps.

34:24.960 --> 34:39.074
I was in Peeps' library last year, and he had a marvelous... He created... He wanted to create the illusion that he'd laced this sort of pod through the vellum.

34:39.414 --> 34:43.938
That's making good sense of both sides.

34:43.958 --> 34:45.480
So, yeah.

34:45.500 --> 34:46.421
The hook was a riot.

34:46.441 --> 34:48.503
And it's a unique volume, right?

34:48.523 --> 34:49.464
Yes, it's a unique volume.

34:49.924 --> 34:50.965
There is...

34:52.480 --> 34:57.508
There's one other book written by this scribe which this artist illuminated also.

34:57.829 --> 35:01.715
The separation in time was 20 years or something.

35:01.735 --> 35:04.159
And there's a missile that he illuminated.

35:04.781 --> 35:15.298
And actually the most interesting of all is Hufnagel owned a Flemish Book of Hours from around 1470, at the same time as that Alexander manuscript that we looked at, a very beautiful little book of hours, which had

35:15.717 --> 35:28.212
illusionistic flowers and insects from the time painted in, and then he took it and added his own, so that they're like late 15th century flowers and fruit, and then there's late 16th century, it's in the Royal Library of Blessings, and it's absolutely fabulous.

35:28.452 --> 35:29.033
It's a great thing.

35:29.453 --> 35:31.055
Was this for instructional purposes?

35:31.756 --> 35:38.704
Well, this again was a little bit, it's a little bit like the Book of Hours, the thing that you were talking about.

35:39.005 --> 35:45.995
Nominally, it was for instructional purposes, but it became a sort of precious object.

35:47.296 --> 35:51.602
They were show pieces, you know, sort of like pulling out your Van Goghs and your Rembrandts.

35:51.622 --> 35:54.286
Have these ever been done in facsimile?

35:54.306 --> 35:56.068
No, we're working actually on this now.

35:56.950 --> 36:05.181
As it happens, the Associate Curator of Drawings, Lee Hendricks, did her dissertation on another Hoofnagle manuscript, and so she and

36:05.988 --> 36:11.875
A German scholar who we commissioned have written a facsimile, which is hopefully the first one we publish.

36:12.116 --> 36:14.579
But I mean, you would do all the illustrations.

36:14.759 --> 36:16.541
Yeah, everything.

36:17.142 --> 36:19.785
We hope it'll be out by next Christmas.

36:19.805 --> 36:20.446
Not this Christmas.

36:20.466 --> 36:22.829
And you'll publish that with your imprint, the Getty imprint?

36:23.049 --> 36:28.355
Yeah, it'll be printed probably in England or in Switzerland, but we're going to try to do it ourselves.

36:28.636 --> 36:29.397
I'll buy one, for sure.

36:29.737 --> 36:31.479
Yeah, that's a great thing.

36:32.080 --> 36:33.181
Now, this is interesting, too.

36:33.442 --> 36:34.543
This is on paper.

36:35.131 --> 36:43.946
which was painted black, because you couldn't dye, in a sense, a piece of vellum, but I thought it was difficult to do it successfully.

36:44.827 --> 36:46.390
But he really wanted to do that, you see.

36:46.811 --> 36:54.163
I mean, he really had to go to great lengths to get that, to get all his effects.

36:56.928 --> 36:58.911
And it's one of the things.

37:00.157 --> 37:06.647
And then at the end, now this is a different, this section here was, oh there, let's see, let's find something from, this is good, oh there.

37:07.067 --> 37:08.389
It was added by Hufnagel later.

37:08.429 --> 37:13.477
It's on a different vellum, you can tell, but it's something different, and it's all, the decoration is in Hufnagel's own hand.

37:13.537 --> 37:21.669
And it's called, it's a section on how to construct the letters of the alphabet, which is also, again, yeah, see the geometry.

37:24.213 --> 37:26.056
That's the study of calligraphy, huh?

37:26.076 --> 37:28.780
So then it has all these crazy, this is sort of more crazy manners.

37:30.110 --> 37:32.674
I can't believe it.

37:32.714 --> 37:33.796
Look at the head on that.

37:35.138 --> 37:37.662
It's almost a human head on the dog, isn't it?

37:39.304 --> 37:39.525
Yeah.

37:39.665 --> 37:41.428
Eyebrows and an expression.

37:41.849 --> 37:43.531
That's beautiful, too, the ostriches.

37:44.272 --> 37:47.217
It's going to be a wonderful publication.

37:47.277 --> 37:48.339
Yes, it's a great book.

37:48.359 --> 37:50.642
And you'll do it to size, I guess.

37:50.662 --> 37:51.123
Yes, absolutely.

37:51.624 --> 37:55.510
It's going to be hard to do because it's so big that it'll be very expensive, but we thought we should do it.

37:55.692 --> 37:57.273
And it was made for Rudolf II.

37:57.313 --> 38:00.616
That's the double eagle, which is the Habsburg emblem.

38:01.217 --> 38:05.601
And then Hufnagel in German is hoof and nail.

38:05.741 --> 38:07.322
And the hoof and nail is the signature.

38:08.043 --> 38:09.024
And the G is Georg.

38:09.845 --> 38:11.786
And there's a date in 1596.

38:13.028 --> 38:14.229
So everything you could want in the book.

38:14.749 --> 38:15.730
It's wonderful.

38:16.631 --> 38:21.956
You can even see a little sense of humor in there, too.

38:22.116 --> 38:23.157
Yeah, no, there is.

38:23.257 --> 38:25.699
But the thing is, this is a very, and that's a good point, because this is

38:25.966 --> 38:26.527
This is it.

38:26.547 --> 38:28.829
This is the end of manuscript illumination as an art form.

38:28.849 --> 38:30.931
1596 is incredibly late.

38:31.432 --> 38:35.076
And in the 17th century, there are really no major manuscript illuminators at all.

38:35.556 --> 38:38.700
In the north, Hufnaga is probably the last great one.

38:38.740 --> 38:41.803
And in fact, there are only about six books that he illuminated that survived.

38:41.823 --> 38:44.386
He's better known for prints and drawings and watercolors.

38:44.826 --> 38:51.013
Actually, next year we're going to do a show around this book on the facsimile comes out, which would be really neat.

38:51.033 --> 38:53.155
Because he's the last great manuscript illuminator.

38:53.354 --> 38:56.899
But his studies of flowers and fruit were incredibly important for the Dutch still life painters.

38:57.319 --> 39:01.445
So he stands sort of pivotally between a medieval tradition and a modern tradition.

39:01.745 --> 39:04.709
And this is one that you, this is not, again, this is not part of Ludwig.

39:04.729 --> 39:12.139
This is one of the subsequent, that gives you a special degree of satisfaction, I'm sure, because you've located that, I gather.

39:12.159 --> 39:13.461
Yeah, that's fun.

39:13.481 --> 39:14.021
That's pretty neat.

39:15.423 --> 39:16.505
Chase down the owner.

39:20.710 --> 39:22.753
Who wouldn't chase down the owner?
