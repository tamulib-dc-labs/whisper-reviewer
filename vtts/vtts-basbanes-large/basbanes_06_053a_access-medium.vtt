WEBVTT

00:02.731 --> 00:04.433
Okay, we're talking to Peter Howard.

00:05.154 --> 00:14.865
I'm giving you the general... Is European bookselling different from... Let's hope in there, you know, in terms of the knowledge of the books.

00:14.885 --> 00:16.327
What is this?

00:16.347 --> 00:19.511
Is European bookselling different from what bookselling?

00:19.531 --> 00:20.672
Japanese bookselling?

00:20.692 --> 00:22.414
Well, American bookselling.

00:22.434 --> 00:23.395
American bookselling.

00:23.415 --> 00:29.362
You know, you see scholars, you see somebody like Perez, who knows his books.

00:29.382 --> 00:32.586
There's a scholar, a bookseller in the middle of Berkeley who was...

00:33.410 --> 00:58.082
as eminently qualified in the scholarship he does on the books he sells and in the scholarship he retains in his past achievements and in his study, is the equal of any bookseller in the world, Ian Jackson, so that the dispersal and location of booksellers who happen to be scholars is as arbitrary as it is individual.

00:58.883 --> 01:03.028
If an individual bookseller is also a scholar, glory be to God.

01:03.852 --> 01:13.207
To think that there's a better tradition of scholar bookselling in Europe than in America, I think, is a very arbitrary assumption.

01:13.227 --> 01:18.615
I didn't say better, but I wonder if, you know, what Fred Schreiber indicated.

01:18.655 --> 01:22.221
Fred Schreiber is a bookseller in the United States who's well known as a scholar bookseller.

01:23.823 --> 01:27.149
Ian Jackson is a scholar bookseller who's not well known.

01:27.169 --> 01:27.529
He's here?

01:28.090 --> 01:29.252
Right in the middle of Berkeley.

01:29.907 --> 01:48.685
So that, I'm very loath to the book business, antiquarian book business, although there are a number of associations of booksellers, and all of them amalgamated in concentric circles, antiquarian book business is almost entirely vested in the skills of the individual bookseller.

01:51.287 --> 01:59.155
And summary remarks about these booksellers is best and most wisely left to

02:00.012 --> 02:03.638
you know, an examination of the individual bookseller.

02:04.399 --> 02:06.282
It's a very fragile function.

02:06.923 --> 02:09.908
It almost invariably lasts only as long as he or she lasts.

02:12.192 --> 02:17.901
And I'm loathe to make generalizations about the trade that sweep over specific information.

02:20.446 --> 02:26.796
So you will not get me to say that the Europeans are somehow more highly committed to

02:27.518 --> 02:31.042
And I don't think that's what I asked either.

02:31.363 --> 02:37.410
I guess that's a general way into the conversation.

02:37.430 --> 02:49.746
What is pleasing is that Mr. Beres has seen fit to exhibit at American book fairs an almost unprecedented step among the French, only two or three of whom, three or four of whom

02:50.232 --> 02:57.580
have bothered to come to the United States in order to see what's going on perhaps, or to sell books, or to make themselves better known to the general public.

02:57.820 --> 03:02.885
Well, let's have a general softball question down the middle of a point to that.

03:03.966 --> 03:07.009
Describe the state of American bookselling.

03:07.029 --> 03:19.142
No, I'm extremely unwilling to describe the state of American bookselling, except that it seems at the moment to be sound and ongoing, evolving.

03:19.747 --> 03:41.589
The appeal of the profession has perhaps grown because one can measure the constancy of the membership and applications to the seminars, which purport to give some introduction to antiquarian book selling held annually in Colorado and in Florida.

03:42.110 --> 03:48.336
Attendance at those seminars has been consistent, sound, and full, suggesting that

03:49.936 --> 03:56.705
a steady flow of people find the Aquarian book business attractive.

03:57.005 --> 03:57.806
None of them are black.

03:59.008 --> 04:13.927
On the other hand, Afro-American, it's not a profession appealing to Afro-Americans as heart surgery is or any other profession, so it has its limited appeal to say the least.

04:15.268 --> 04:19.774
It's not perceived to be a profession in which people are

04:21.796 --> 04:35.949
invited to enter to make a programmed income and a living that is likely to be progressive and guaranteed in the way that any of the other professions in the United States, and in fact we're just tradesmen in that regard.

04:36.950 --> 04:50.622
And our training is hardly any better than a tradesman, unless an individual applies himself and has particular skills.

04:51.412 --> 04:56.477
In fact, the ABA membership is not significantly increasing in the exponential rate.

04:57.258 --> 05:01.022
It loses a few, it gains a few, and remains relatively steady.

05:03.304 --> 05:15.697
I think it's become slightly easier for members of the ABA, which is the only group I can really speak for, except for the isolated examples of individuals that I know who are not members with whom I am extremely close.

05:17.599 --> 05:20.001
It's my experience or guess that

05:20.707 --> 05:28.920
These booksellers have not an easier time of it, but have a sounder time of it on the basis of good hard work.

05:28.960 --> 05:43.462
But bookselling will take individuals only as far as their own skills, learning, education, experience, and personality will allow them.

05:44.364 --> 05:47.068
And they're not subject to generalities.

05:47.605 --> 05:52.472
business I've always maintained is extremely difficult.

05:52.492 --> 05:54.615
What do you feel shaped you as a bookseller?

05:54.635 --> 05:55.356
My education.

05:56.137 --> 05:59.823
What you could briefly describe for me.

05:59.843 --> 06:09.777
I was determined to become a student of literature, American and English, and to teach it from early in high school.

06:09.957 --> 06:16.887
I spent four years in college and another eight or nine years in graduate school.

06:17.035 --> 06:29.812
I graduated from Haverford College with a double major in biblical literature and English literature, and I chased a Ph.D.

06:29.832 --> 06:32.035
at the University of California at Berkeley, got an M.A.

06:32.075 --> 06:45.793
after two years, and continued on toward a Ph.D., passing a few tests in German, Old English, Middle English, Latin.

06:46.482 --> 06:49.566
I had French yet to go, and I had been advanced to candidacy.

06:50.487 --> 06:57.637
But, in fact, I was being wooed by the Aquarian book trade in ways that were probably unique to me.

06:59.399 --> 07:05.588
Do you care to share any of those ways that, those factors that attracted you?

07:06.549 --> 07:13.418
Two of my colleagues in subject A, we all taught remedial English to freshmen, sophomores, and juniors.

07:14.208 --> 07:28.950
Two of my colleagues and I were committed to building graduate students' libraries, and I swiftly found that I had already started to collect D. H. Lawrence for obscure reasons when I was in high school, right in college.

07:30.012 --> 07:36.301
And so I had begun to frequent bookstores up and down the West Coast.

07:38.044 --> 07:43.692
And I also found that I had a propensity to gamble in Emeryville, where local options prevailed.

07:45.224 --> 07:53.576
I found quickly enough that my pleasure, my needs, were to find books for others.

07:54.358 --> 07:58.704
And so I took greater joy in finding books for my two colleagues than I did for myself.

08:00.086 --> 08:06.796
And I found a long run of the Early English Text Society, which I sold to the university for their humanities reading room.

08:08.579 --> 08:11.423
And that was a sort of a turning point.

08:11.443 --> 08:14.708
It was my first institutional sale.

08:15.143 --> 08:27.098
to Dorothy Keller, who was then head of the library, and who complained bitterly that I had had the set rebound at my expense, because it would have cost them less to have the rebound themselves.

08:28.300 --> 08:32.104
But it was my introduction to institutional sales.

08:32.625 --> 08:35.489
You were a bookseller at this particular point.

08:35.569 --> 08:41.616
I had gotten my resale number in 1963, which was my third year as a graduate student.

08:41.657 --> 08:42.838
From that point on,

08:43.662 --> 08:48.747
In retrospect, it was only a matter of time, but I wasn't certain that I knew that.

08:52.531 --> 08:53.853
I was still going to Emeryville.

08:54.053 --> 08:56.375
When I once made... Explain to me what Emeryville is.

08:56.395 --> 09:04.163
Emeryville is a town where gambling is a local option and is permitted, so I was playing cards in Emeryville in the evening.

09:06.886 --> 09:12.572
And the day I once sold...

09:12.957 --> 09:24.693
books and made a profit equal to the profit I might conceivably have made gambling, I never went back.

09:25.033 --> 09:33.385
So in retrospect, it was clear to me that the motivation to gamble was in part having to do with money.

09:33.825 --> 09:34.306
It was not.

09:34.666 --> 09:35.027
It was.

09:35.287 --> 09:36.349
It was to do with money.

09:36.369 --> 09:36.489
Yes.

09:37.470 --> 09:41.175
It was money that I sought, not so much the gambling impulses.

09:42.151 --> 09:43.813
In other words, I wasn't addicted to gambling.

09:43.853 --> 09:47.497
I was somehow uneasy about money.

09:48.858 --> 09:53.023
That certainly has characterized my bookselling career as well.

09:54.524 --> 09:55.485
And in what respect?

09:55.505 --> 10:08.479
Well, a preoccupation with feeling self-sufficient and emotionally in need of...

10:09.033 --> 10:19.749
being successful in some small sense or in some large sense in an economic way, whether or not this is an admirable quality.

10:19.829 --> 10:23.915
I certainly don't admire it over much, but I have some respect for it.

10:23.975 --> 10:36.053
It certainly was a motivating factor in my career that, in fact, I became aware that I was less than intellectual.

10:36.421 --> 10:38.003
or less suited to be an intellectual.

10:38.343 --> 10:40.686
And, in fact, I've never regarded myself as an intellectual.

10:41.567 --> 10:45.211
Everybody else regards you as a profound intellectual.

10:45.231 --> 10:47.654
Well, I think they're probably wrong, and they don't know me well enough.

10:48.414 --> 10:58.606
I'm not preoccupied with ideas, and ideas don't monopolize my head time.

11:00.548 --> 11:01.890
Are you preoccupied with anything?

11:02.410 --> 11:04.032
I'm preoccupied with

11:06.053 --> 11:35.065
the emotions associated with baseball, professional baseball, and the emotions associated with beginning, forming, shaping, and continuing to direct an evolving business, such that the whole of Serendipity Books and what it represents and for whom,

11:35.720 --> 11:46.070
and all of the myriad of relationships that are implied and real that have to do with me and with my business.

11:47.551 --> 11:57.161
All of those complexes are what I am and what my business is, and they're also the sustaining factors in my business.

11:57.461 --> 11:59.423
How long did you build this building?

11:59.443 --> 12:02.226
No, I bought this building in 1986.

12:02.866 --> 12:04.748
And what was it before?

12:05.285 --> 12:16.337
It had been built in 17 years before that day, a single-purpose re-standing building built by immigrant Romanian oenologists.

12:16.917 --> 12:17.458
Oenologists.

12:19.640 --> 12:28.349
He sold wine and beer-making equipment, and I have not altered the structure of the building to an iota.

12:28.409 --> 12:33.074
I've strengthened some portions of it, but I have respected its original structure.

12:33.895 --> 12:34.836
At the time, it was the

12:35.305 --> 12:42.073
Earthquake ready and proved to be so during the 1989 earthquake.

12:43.074 --> 12:43.996
What are they about, 15 feet?

12:44.016 --> 12:50.203
I think they're a little higher than that, 16 feet.

12:51.084 --> 12:53.547
How many books would you say you have in here, roughly?

12:53.567 --> 12:57.432
I'm pleased to say that I have 400,000 books, whether it's true or not.

12:57.597 --> 13:02.663
Well, I have two or three warehouses as well, but we can get an awful lot of books in there.

13:02.683 --> 13:03.344
I don't really know.

13:03.604 --> 13:04.646
You have 400,000 books.

13:04.986 --> 13:07.189
I certainly believe I have 400,000 books.

13:07.209 --> 13:07.389
Wow.

13:10.113 --> 13:12.155
So, tell me your philosophy of acquisition.

13:12.395 --> 13:15.279
I mean, do you have a sense of what the 400,000 books are?

13:16.020 --> 13:17.161
Of course, I know them all.

13:17.482 --> 13:18.743
You know them all.

13:18.763 --> 13:21.627
I'd like to believe that I do, yes.

13:22.348 --> 13:27.334
How well I know them is a measure of how good a bookseller I am.

13:27.618 --> 13:34.307
say that I know them very superficially, and often I'll admit to that.

13:36.189 --> 13:48.386
It's not a question, the books that are usually welcomed, have you read this book, do you know what this book is, etc., etc., but I think I have a sufficient understanding of the books that I deal in.

13:49.467 --> 13:53.052
Sometimes I sell books before they get prolated, but that's at the

13:53.622 --> 14:00.171
behest of the buyer and when they come back I welcome them back with an open arm and that usually is not a problem.

14:01.613 --> 14:22.802
I am a servant of the community and I have the responsibility to honor all of the opportunities that have come about because I've been in business a long time and have had strong relationships with a few people and a few libraries.

14:23.373 --> 14:24.314
and a few booksellers.

14:26.818 --> 14:35.309
Maintaining these relationships inevitably result in a constant flow of books or an opportunity to have books flow.

14:36.250 --> 14:43.059
And I've always been somebody who's been willing to shoulder the responsibility of dealing with the opportunity rather than saying no.

14:44.220 --> 14:47.745
And I've always learned to take them all rather than to take only the one.

14:47.785 --> 14:52.992
So in fact, many of the books that are

14:53.765 --> 15:03.458
represented here are the residue of successful sales rather than the stock from which I will make a future profit.

15:04.459 --> 15:21.662
I also, because of the technology available to me on a good staff and good space and a sense of doing things the right way and sufficient lines of credit, I've also, I would have to say, mastered the art of selling on consignment

15:22.435 --> 15:51.649
almost always by receiving books from friends who are unable to sell them and who trust me and who want me to sell them for them are the happiest of circumstances and also because I'm certainly representative of one of the most significant changes in the book business and that is to say joint ownership of books among two or more dealers

15:52.118 --> 15:56.602
with large quantities of books.

15:56.863 --> 15:58.744
Can you give me a couple of examples on that?

15:58.764 --> 15:59.625
Well, it's simple.

15:59.905 --> 16:14.139
Two dealers will buy a library, either because of geographical reasons or financial reasons or relational reasons, and the books then either get split or not split, depending on where the books are and who can sell what.

16:15.180 --> 16:18.143
They get coded and they get sold or not sold.

16:18.899 --> 16:26.211
Each of the booksellers trusts the other to honorably report the results and pay the money's due.

16:26.832 --> 16:27.754
I'm very good at that.

16:28.215 --> 16:33.924
I'm trusted by a large number of friends, and I trust them equally.

16:35.767 --> 16:43.320
And this is particularly effective when the two are on separate coasts or have separate skills.

16:43.874 --> 16:47.360
Could you give me a couple of specific examples?

16:47.380 --> 16:50.745
Well, we bought the contents of Client Brooks' house.

16:51.666 --> 17:03.625
Waiting for Godot Books for Annie Ness and Gary Olsen and Serendipity bought the contents of Client Brooks' house in New Haven.

17:04.747 --> 17:11.097
This involved not only papers of Client Brooks that Beinecke didn't want,

17:12.005 --> 17:40.476
but also old books, which he had gathered when he was a young man on Rhodes Fellowship at Oxford, and significant quantities of books of modern writers with whom he was close, Elliot and Welty and Loverpin Warren, which recorded special treatment, so that I was able to sell all the Faulkner-related material to Xavier University in New Orleans and all of the

17:41.114 --> 17:55.010
books as copies of his own work to the University of South Carolina, while Godot, in the meantime, catalogued the Welty Collection and was in the process of cataloguing the Robert Penn Warren Collection.

17:55.551 --> 18:02.219
And each of us, in the meantime, sells individual books as they come our way.

18:03.200 --> 18:09.788
Similarly, when waiting for Godot was vacationing in California and I got a book call at City Lights,

18:10.122 --> 18:16.791
Even though Godot just happened to be in the area at that time, I invited them to come with me and help me move the books.

18:16.992 --> 18:18.934
We bought Perlinghetti's Rare Book Room.

18:20.036 --> 18:22.860
Almost all the books remained here, but they were coded Godot 50.

18:23.861 --> 18:34.636
He shared in the cost, and they share in the receipts so that I will be selling until I die.

18:34.696 --> 18:39.403
Small pamphlets from that room mark $3, less discounted dealers.

18:39.738 --> 18:42.821
Godot will get half the profit, or half the receipts.

18:44.403 --> 18:47.306
But this happens frequently these days.

18:47.426 --> 19:01.802
Serendipity negotiated the purchase of a portion of Carter Burden's books, 18,000 books, and took into partnership someone, another dealer who had more available cash.

19:02.683 --> 19:07.468
He fronted his half, though the deal was over time, so he got a slight discount.

19:07.728 --> 19:09.610
He got 50% of all receipts.

19:10.349 --> 19:16.557
And although I outsell him five to one, we split all of the monies, and everyone is happy.

19:16.577 --> 19:17.258
Who's that dealer?

19:17.698 --> 19:19.681
That dealer's Anna Kappa Books, David Worship.

19:23.866 --> 19:25.168
Is this now gone?

19:25.328 --> 19:28.452
There was a big ad in the Biblio magazine, three pages.

19:29.513 --> 19:35.901
The Burden Estate has offered another 18,000 books for sale, which I was an underbidder on, which went to

19:36.455 --> 19:43.547
Two young men who are new to the book business and who are selling them in ways not known to me.

19:45.450 --> 19:49.356
I think they've asked them to experiment a lot of money for some of these books.

19:49.376 --> 19:50.819
Well, what they've asked is their business.

19:51.540 --> 19:55.126
I've heard exactly what they've asked because I've spoken with one library who was interested.

19:55.206 --> 19:57.349
Several million is what I've heard.

19:58.231 --> 19:59.793
But it doesn't really matter what they ask.

20:00.454 --> 20:02.698
I know roughly what they paid.

20:02.813 --> 20:07.020
I've heard what they asked, but if they don't get what they asked, they're going to have to ask less or more.

20:07.060 --> 20:09.103
And good luck to them.

20:09.143 --> 20:19.459
They have the books under honorable circumstances, and getting the books in an upwardly mobile market is the secret of bookselling.

20:21.022 --> 20:26.290
So long as one keeps one's finances in order and maintains an honorable puss in the...

20:26.843 --> 20:28.145
face in the mirror.

20:28.165 --> 20:32.891
Not meaning to go off on the Carter Burden thing, because that's whether or not I've written about it.

20:33.312 --> 20:36.716
So what does the court collection now consist of?

20:36.736 --> 20:39.280
Consists of all the books that the Burden estate has not sold.

20:40.121 --> 20:43.285
But I mean, what's that, about 20,000, 30,000 books?

20:43.565 --> 20:46.089
I would think it was slightly more than 30,000 books.

20:47.330 --> 20:55.922
And 90% of the dollars that Carter spent, I think, are still at home in the

20:56.746 --> 20:57.807
books that he's retained.

20:57.847 --> 21:15.286
The collections that had been retained by the family are obviously those that are slightly more valued in terms both of their marketability and also their literary consequence.

21:16.247 --> 21:24.255
But I don't personally tend to celebrate

21:25.197 --> 21:30.605
an individual book simply because it's by a better author or a better copy or worth more money.

21:31.245 --> 21:39.076
I don't like that aspect of bookselling as much as I like the aspect of simple service, no matter what the book does.

21:39.777 --> 21:42.762
And one more question that will leave Carter with.

21:42.782 --> 21:49.191
Do you think then, in view of what you just said, that his scheme was a sagacious one?

21:49.311 --> 21:51.554
I don't think Carter had a sagacious scheme.

21:51.594 --> 21:53.837
The notion of Carter investing books is a stupid one.

21:54.391 --> 22:00.117
And I won't even discuss the notion of investing in books, booksellers invest in books.

22:00.697 --> 22:18.475
Carter collected books, he had collected art, he collected glass bells, and he got some joy and gratification in collecting, and made some contributions to future understanding of this and that.

22:19.035 --> 22:21.678
And he helped define the milieu too, didn't he?

22:22.038 --> 22:23.740
No, he did not help him define anything.

22:24.125 --> 22:27.569
Under any circumstances, Carter did not define anything.

22:31.313 --> 22:40.402
But he was supportive of the book trade, and many young booksellers are better for his having cared to spend some money on books.

22:40.943 --> 22:47.770
You mentioned at the beginning that a great deal of the satisfaction for you is in getting the books for other people.

22:49.331 --> 22:53.676
Well, all of the satisfaction for me is in...

22:54.854 --> 22:58.898
being part of a continuum in which books need to move from one place to another.

22:58.918 --> 23:00.399
Many of them move through me.

23:01.780 --> 23:15.113
And my job is to orchestrate the continuum and to do so honourably and to bring some pleasure to all parties, as much pleasure as possible, as much satisfaction.

23:15.133 --> 23:23.140
Not necessarily as much money as possible, but a sufficiency of money in an honourable way.

23:24.098 --> 23:27.122
and to do it with some sense of style and propriety.

23:28.444 --> 23:30.566
Do you do much work with institutions?

23:31.107 --> 23:49.431
I do an enormous amount of work with institutions, from appraisals on a next-day basis to selling individual books, mailing $10 small press printings to the Bancroft because they collect the local printer, to selling

23:49.765 --> 23:54.252
large archives, when possible, to the appropriate place.

23:55.314 --> 24:03.427
So I sell from one book to 100-box archives to institutions whenever it's appropriate.

24:03.828 --> 24:11.440
Have you ever assisted in what they call collection development and actually defining the focus of a research archive?

24:11.740 --> 24:15.807
Only in the minimal way that for some time we certainly chose the

24:17.170 --> 24:25.139
modern small press poetry and fiction that the University of California and Santa Cruz acquired, but that approval plan has been defunct for some time now.

24:26.060 --> 24:40.357
In general, the libraries, it is the responsibility of the librarians to choose what books they want, and if they make privy to me what they want, we certainly are effective in supplying it.

24:40.377 --> 24:45.203
The most notable contribution of serendipity to any such approval

24:45.520 --> 24:57.031
plan, not approval plan, but plan, a plan, any plan, it was that among other serendipity had want lists for American fiction 1901 to 1950 from Ohio State.

24:58.092 --> 25:02.376
The want lists were specific, and it numbered at least 15,000 books.

25:05.039 --> 25:11.325
And included with the want lists was the implied notion that Ohio State wanted any book that they didn't know about.

25:12.217 --> 25:13.839
By certain authors?

25:13.859 --> 25:17.325
By any author, any American fiction author between 1901 and 1950.

25:17.886 --> 25:19.208
So the years were what?

25:19.268 --> 25:20.469
The years were the parameters.

25:22.072 --> 25:29.743
And we supplied, offered, we offered to Ohio State, we found and offered to Ohio State more than 10,000 of the 15,000 books.

25:29.763 --> 25:31.406
On their list or in addition to?

25:31.426 --> 25:33.249
On their list and in addition.

25:33.569 --> 25:34.991
Over how long of a period of time?

25:35.011 --> 25:36.393
Over a period of about four years.

25:36.794 --> 25:38.517
Five years, six years, seven years.

25:38.697 --> 25:40.339
So you were constantly sending?

25:40.359 --> 25:41.481
It's a constant process.

25:42.355 --> 25:51.946
And so the work we did became the basis for the Depository Collection in the United States of American Fiction 1901-1950.

25:52.227 --> 25:54.009
It's still an ongoing project.

25:54.650 --> 25:56.992
There's still many books they don't have, which they know exist.

25:58.134 --> 26:08.346
In the meantime, the bibliography of American Fiction 1901-1925 has been published by Cambridge University Press, and it is an examination of the

26:08.900 --> 26:20.014
books that exist between 1901 and 1925, which are American fiction, many of which, but by no means a majority, came from Serendipity.

26:20.034 --> 26:26.682
We certainly have supplied the majority of the books from 1926 to 1950, but that bibliography has not yet been written.

26:28.364 --> 26:35.953
So in that sense, by physically supplying the books, and actually identifying the large number of books that

26:36.794 --> 26:42.961
had not previously been identified as appropriate, one makes a modest contribution to someone else's scholarship.

26:44.503 --> 27:05.586
Certainly you're alert to the debate that's going on, and we see it right over here at Berkeley where less and less money is going to the acquisition of books, more and more money is going to the purchase of computer hardware, software, and the budget isn't even adjusted for inflation, so the budget since 1989 has been the same.

27:06.106 --> 27:16.577
Do you find this a disquieting trend, or do you think that progress is progress in the electronic ways, especially since you do so much business with universities?

27:16.597 --> 27:19.200
It's a problem that the libraries have to solve.

27:19.220 --> 27:20.841
The booksellers cannot solve it for them.

27:23.644 --> 27:34.155
My solution is that the library, in several ways, raises money to compensate for the

27:36.683 --> 27:40.068
backward steps because of the double budgeting.

27:41.430 --> 27:44.254
It's easy to say such a thing and harder to accomplish.

27:45.576 --> 27:51.084
It's obvious that they must keep up with electronic developments, even though some may think it's less obvious.

27:51.184 --> 27:55.590
I think it's in the aggregate absolutely obvious.

27:56.692 --> 28:05.104
So whether or not one or two libraries chooses not to go that route as swiftly or as utterly as the rest,

28:05.641 --> 28:07.744
The fact is that the world is going to go that route.

28:10.067 --> 28:16.335
And so they simply have to raise and designate more money for the acquisition of books.

28:16.535 --> 28:34.939
I don't think for a moment that the number of books or the dollar value of books that need to be acquired are going to decrease what many libraries will do, particularly if the texts of books are automatically online, as I think many of us believe

28:35.746 --> 28:41.052
You know, vast quantities, not all, but vast quantities of books will be readable simply online.

28:42.354 --> 28:48.842
So many libraries will make the choice not to acquire the type of book that will be available online.

28:48.862 --> 28:52.406
I think all scholarly periodicals will be online.

28:52.987 --> 28:57.613
I think all scholarly books published by Mercy Presses will be online.

28:59.795 --> 29:03.660
Stanford's already done ten.

29:03.910 --> 29:10.878
Libraries, in fact, will be spared the expense of acquiring expensive periodicals and binding them.

29:10.898 --> 29:23.993
And in the long run, maybe there will be an advantage to the computer development of it, in the sense that the libraries will not have to buy certain kinds of books at all.

29:24.013 --> 29:25.275
I think that's obvious.

29:26.616 --> 29:32.263
But booksellers deal with the reality of a book in the hand, or an archive in the hand,

29:32.733 --> 29:33.935
or a manuscript in the hand.

29:36.398 --> 29:48.836
I'm not one for theorizing about the book trade, or about life in general, or about the future of baseball, so that I have plenty of books which I have no time to theorize about.

29:48.876 --> 30:00.833
I have the obligation and the responsibility to make them available for sale and sell them, and the computer may, I think, obviously, if properly used,

30:01.960 --> 30:05.804
make it slightly easier for me to sell certain kinds of books.

30:05.824 --> 30:08.648
Does it influence the kinds of books that you're more willing to acquire?

30:09.288 --> 30:12.552
I think not.

30:12.572 --> 30:25.927
When one finds that one has a type of book that seems to sell over the internet, and this is all baby talk so far, then of course one tries to find the time to make sure that that book is available on the internet.

30:26.007 --> 30:28.390
I've sold seven copies of

30:29.787 --> 30:31.389
the Canadian magazine Pan No.

30:31.409 --> 30:38.417
2, which is an anthology of young Canadian poets edited by Irving Leighton, at $35 each and a little more.

30:38.497 --> 30:53.213
And I'm informed that I have another 100 copies in the warehouse, and so I will be motivated to find them in my warehouse and bring them to the store and let the person who has already bought five of them know that I have 100 more.

30:54.745 --> 31:09.499
And this information and availability came about because of the Internet, but the profit on that transaction was not sufficient to pay my postage bill for one day, so I don't overvalue.

31:09.519 --> 31:15.725
I simply acknowledge and recognize the potential for what certain kinds of things can happen on the Internet.

31:16.225 --> 31:23.012
I have 5,000 books on the Internet, or six, and I have 400,000 books in stock.

31:23.032 --> 31:24.533
I do think that

31:25.711 --> 31:48.526
If I have 100,000 books on the Internet, which I think is easy to do, very easy to do, although I will not hire a slave simply to type them in, so I'll be the one who types them in, or since I have only a few employees and am not desirous of any more, I think I could look forward to an easier afterlife.

31:49.688 --> 31:52.512
If I had no employees, if I had 100,000 books on the Internet,

31:54.500 --> 31:58.424
And I've contemplated my later years frequently lately.

31:59.485 --> 32:00.806
Some of my friends are not well.

32:02.227 --> 32:07.051
But in fact, that is not the way serendipity grew, and it's not likely to happen in that way.

32:08.232 --> 32:14.338
I'm likely just to drop dead from lifting one too many boxes and leave someone else to clean up the mess.

32:15.519 --> 32:16.500
And it would be a big mess.

32:17.381 --> 32:18.602
How old do you think?

32:18.622 --> 32:23.106
I'm almost 60.

32:23.778 --> 32:27.943
persuaded you to buy 130 copies of hand?

32:27.963 --> 32:29.585
Oh, I didn't have to spend a penny for them.

32:29.905 --> 32:33.750
All that stuff.

32:33.770 --> 32:40.117
One of my friends, who was the best bookseller in Canada, decided that he no longer wanted to be a bookseller at all in Canada, and he moved to Russia.

32:40.157 --> 32:48.267
And I took responsibility for his stock, originally 80-20, and subsequently 50-50 on a mutually agreeable basis.

32:49.148 --> 32:50.429
This was another consignment.

32:50.650 --> 32:53.413
I picked up all the books, and he moved to Russia.

32:54.068 --> 32:58.474
And I have been representing his books ever since with great honor and some success.

32:59.436 --> 33:04.823
And since he was a great book seller, he had a significant stock, which can do nothing but mature.

33:04.883 --> 33:15.679
Canadian literature is not a major focus in many lives, but it has its place and role, and books often meet different needs over time.

33:16.340 --> 33:19.244
Well, you're lucky you have the warehouse space to indulge that kind of work.

33:19.264 --> 33:22.168
The warehouse space is fixed overhead, and

33:22.705 --> 33:25.629
Booksellers should beware of fixed overhead.

33:25.709 --> 33:28.853
Booksellers should never have books in a warehouse, in my opinion.

33:28.873 --> 33:30.175
But you have three warehouses.

33:30.195 --> 33:31.356
But I have three warehouses.

33:32.638 --> 33:37.824
So there's no contradiction in terms there.

33:38.005 --> 33:40.928
When acquiring books, 400,000 books, you said you know what you've got.

33:41.910 --> 33:45.634
What kind of criteria do you apply?

33:45.654 --> 33:47.397
I mean, what books won't you get?

33:47.497 --> 33:48.398
What books will you get?

33:48.558 --> 33:49.660
How do you make this decision?

33:49.680 --> 33:51.582
I'm an opportunist.

33:53.182 --> 34:00.272
acquire quantities of books when there's a sufficiency of books worth the effort inside the quantity of books.

34:01.093 --> 34:06.361
I try semi-successfully to get rid of truly bad books.

34:06.441 --> 34:09.365
I'd simply put them on the street, and they'd go away in a day or so.

34:09.405 --> 34:12.309
You physically put them on the street?

34:12.329 --> 34:12.409
Yes.

34:12.429 --> 34:18.818
Santa Cruz consigns books to me on Wednesdays, and we routinely put

34:19.237 --> 34:22.821
19 out of 20 boxes on the street, and keep the one box.

34:22.961 --> 34:24.703
And what do you charge for them?

34:24.723 --> 34:26.745
A book or something?

34:26.765 --> 34:27.806
The books on the street are free.

34:28.147 --> 34:28.367
Oh, really?

34:28.647 --> 34:28.747
Yes.

34:30.369 --> 34:32.151
Do you get a lot of poor people coming to get books?

34:32.191 --> 34:36.236
Street people take the books, and impecunious students.

34:37.357 --> 34:48.349
A school, English for Foreign Students and Computers for Foreign Students, is directly across the street, formerly the 9th grade high school in Berkeley, where my kids went to school.

34:48.734 --> 34:52.879
But whoever walks by and is welcome to pick up whatever I put on the street.

34:53.420 --> 34:55.462
This raises an interesting question.

34:55.543 --> 34:59.808
I did a wonderful deal with Tilly Olson the other day.

34:59.828 --> 35:00.349
I know Tilly.

35:00.369 --> 35:04.213
I actually appraised her archive for a university which subsequently acquired her archive.

35:04.534 --> 35:05.455
What a wonderful woman.

35:05.655 --> 35:06.957
I spent three hours with her.

35:06.977 --> 35:15.788
Tilly is a major presence in this new book, and believe me, not because of the San Francisco Public Library, but because she's Tilly Olson.

35:16.443 --> 35:23.431
who left, who never finished high school, and who was totally a product of her reading of her books.

35:23.451 --> 35:26.475
And possibly a victim of her reading in her books.

35:26.975 --> 35:30.419
And possibly a victim of the reading in her books, indeed.

35:31.180 --> 35:42.433
And she said, and she had a copy of Gentle Madness there from the San Francisco Library, as it turned out, and I opened it up, and she said, look at this, and it was all, it had been checked out, you know, maybe 25,

35:42.835 --> 35:54.388
Really, for me, one of the most satisfying moments I've ever seen with my book, but not only that it's been read and borrowed from the library, but she said there's a purpose to my bringing this up.

35:54.408 --> 35:55.989
She said, I love your book.

35:56.009 --> 36:01.696
She said, but you know, what you didn't get into here is how do poor people collect books?

36:02.416 --> 36:03.518
Do they collect books?

36:03.538 --> 36:05.780
Can they collect books?

36:05.800 --> 36:12.167
And I'm wondering, how would you have answered Tilly if she raised that question?

36:12.485 --> 36:15.409
I never thought, to my, you know, I'm ashamed.

36:15.429 --> 36:16.450
I've never thought of it before.

36:17.451 --> 36:25.702
A poor person is a person without education, the former or earned by application of self.

36:27.685 --> 36:35.836
And I would think it highly likely that the proportion of book collectors among poor people is very small.

36:35.856 --> 36:41.563
I watch street people take books or talk over them

36:42.337 --> 37:02.559
Constantly, but I think for the street people, the physical acquisition of books is a token act and will not in the end result in further education.

37:04.461 --> 37:10.588
It may have been too late already, although I don't ever like to think that it's ever too late for anything.

37:11.632 --> 37:20.120
People of modest means have always collected books, and invariably they are the most interesting of all book collectors and the most gratifying to serve.

37:22.703 --> 37:25.605
No one has enough money, however, to buy all the books they want.

37:27.567 --> 37:29.029
Hi.

37:29.209 --> 37:29.769
Hello again.

37:31.051 --> 37:31.491
Hello.

37:40.339 --> 37:40.980
We're on again.

37:41.652 --> 37:43.434
Okay.

37:43.454 --> 37:46.618
They're not going to be settled down for a while yet.

37:47.960 --> 37:49.061
You do what you have to do, right?

37:49.141 --> 37:49.742
I understand.

37:49.802 --> 37:51.845
If you don't mind my hanging around for a while?

37:52.405 --> 37:53.847
No, no, no, no.

37:53.967 --> 37:58.333
I've given them this warning to me, so maybe as long as necessary.

37:58.353 --> 37:59.394
We were talking about poor people.

38:01.236 --> 38:02.518
Right.

38:02.598 --> 38:06.943
Actually, we had gone to the moderate income people, I think, and they are the most interesting to you.

38:07.083 --> 38:10.107
The Antiquarian Bookstore.

38:10.576 --> 38:17.003
It's the wrong place, I think, to ask about the book buying habits of people with no money or very, very small incomes.

38:18.786 --> 38:24.472
Tavistock Book has just opened up a bookstore on the main drag in Hayward.

38:24.532 --> 38:36.266
He's a member of the ABAA, and I routinely ask him how he's doing, and did he sell any books today, and do the people come in off the street in Hayward, which is a middle-class town, to say the least.

38:36.286 --> 38:38.068
It's got plenty of naval people on it.

38:38.572 --> 38:46.605
And the answer is that occasionally people drift in and meet and have sticker shock and walk right back out.

38:46.625 --> 38:57.663
And on the other hand, Moe's bookstore in the middle of Berkeley on the Telegraph Avenue serves every type of human being and every level of income.

38:57.683 --> 39:04.815
And I am absolutely certain that modestly priced books sell to folks with modest incomes.

39:05.605 --> 39:07.328
I don't like the idea at all.

39:07.828 --> 39:21.109
I'm very hostile to the notion of dividing discussions of books up on the basis of either how much they cost or how much money the customer might have.

39:22.471 --> 39:26.136
I don't think that's the question I ask people.

39:28.039 --> 39:31.765
I'm sure that people with modest incomes

39:33.635 --> 39:47.099
are book buyers in this world, and doubtless the poorest countries in the world produce, such as India and China, produce vast quantities of books available at low prices.

39:47.179 --> 39:53.230
So I'm really not able to discuss that kind of question with much intelligence.

39:53.783 --> 39:59.568
It's just something Tilly threw out, and I thought of it when you mentioned that you put books out there.

39:59.689 --> 40:01.610
It wasn't any part of my agenda at all.

40:01.630 --> 40:11.380
I give plenty of books away, and I think many booksellers do, books which we cannot merchandise in any other way.

40:12.220 --> 40:20.348
I give them away because the street is pleased to find them out there, and because it costs $40 to take a truckload of books to the dump.

40:20.885 --> 40:31.618
Where they would get resorted anyway, at least in Berkeley, because there's a recycling organization in Berkeley that harvests books out of the dump, where I've gotten more than one interesting small archive.

40:31.658 --> 40:32.019
Come on, really?

40:32.660 --> 40:35.043
Oh, yes.

40:35.063 --> 40:43.793
The entire manuscript archive of the California NAACP from 1910 to 1940 came from the Berkeley dump.

40:43.813 --> 40:44.574
How did I get that?

40:44.594 --> 40:46.757
That's a fascinating story.

40:47.800 --> 40:52.486
the largest single correspondence between any two Japanese-American interned persons during the war.

40:52.587 --> 40:58.555
I have more than 900 letters between two kids who met in the camps and who subsequently married.

41:00.017 --> 41:02.200
That archive also came out of the Berkeley them.

41:02.921 --> 41:05.324
Who contacts these people?

41:05.344 --> 41:09.309
Well, every bookseller has his sources and his relationships with other people.

41:10.411 --> 41:14.837
And I have mine, and I do my best to nurture them.

41:15.863 --> 41:20.870
But is it an organized group of people who monitor what comes into the landfill?

41:21.792 --> 41:34.530
I think all dumps and recycling entities in the United States now are monitored for items of value for the purpose of recycling.

41:35.337 --> 41:38.542
Items of obvious value, but who judges the books?

41:39.263 --> 41:42.026
Well, they're recycling doors and door handles.

41:42.047 --> 41:42.748
That's pretty easy.

41:43.108 --> 41:49.517
And there's a lot more money in doors and windows and door handles than there are in books coming out of any dump in the United States.

41:50.258 --> 42:04.939
Books are just another entity or object or paper that gets thrown away by a household or picked up by house cleaners or the dump itself, and these materials get recycled.

42:05.527 --> 42:12.674
It's a modest end of the book business, but books come from all areas.

42:12.714 --> 42:19.281
I was very pleased and proud to recognize the NAACP manuscript archive, and I sold it promptly.

42:20.482 --> 42:23.265
I sold that to the Bancroft Library at Berkeley.

42:24.246 --> 42:24.886
When did this happen?

42:24.906 --> 42:26.968
This is fascinating to me.

42:26.988 --> 42:28.110
That's been some time ago.

42:28.190 --> 42:30.532
It's six or seven years ago.

42:31.012 --> 42:32.614
But to recap,

42:33.269 --> 42:37.256
Somebody contacted you and said, did they know?

42:37.316 --> 42:57.893
Well, either the children of the generator of the material or the family or the heirs or the house cleaners threw away all of the papers of the secretary of the California NAACP, and he had been, in fact, a grocer in Oakland and had meticulously kept all the records.

42:58.430 --> 43:01.916
of the NAACP's activities in California from 1910 to 1940.

43:01.936 --> 43:07.386
He had, in fact, been active in the Spanish Civil War as a black man as a teenager.

43:07.406 --> 43:09.851
He had gone to University of California as a student in 1930.

43:09.911 --> 43:13.076
What was his name, by the way?

43:13.096 --> 43:14.359
I don't remember his name offhand.

43:15.541 --> 43:17.685
I would like to think it was Jackson, but I don't remember.

43:17.765 --> 43:18.386
I'll check it out.

43:18.967 --> 43:20.490
The Bancroft Library was it?

43:20.510 --> 43:20.590
Yes.

43:22.291 --> 43:34.428
But he was a point man when James Weldon Johnson came to Oakland in 1919-1920, which I regard as the most significant event in the California history of the California NAACP.

43:35.809 --> 43:45.302
And into my grocer came letters from all the local chapters all over the state asking if he might negotiate Mr. Johnson's visit to their local chapter.

43:45.322 --> 43:48.687
So it was a documentary history of the

43:49.561 --> 44:02.783
formation of consciousness in the Afro-American in California, and I was very moved and proud to be party to both the recognition of this archive and to its salvation and to its placement.

44:04.125 --> 44:06.489
But it's also a routine matter.

44:07.571 --> 44:16.125
It's routine that someone should watch over material that's been moved from one place to another and contact somebody who's capable of dealing with it.

44:17.000 --> 44:30.439
in this case, me, and it's appropriate that the person, the dealer with whom it ends up, sees to its proper placement without, I hope, gross exploitation.

44:30.820 --> 44:36.988
And it was clearly evident to you that this had to go to an institution and not to an individual collector.

44:37.009 --> 44:39.492
There were many, many people who are African-Americans.

44:39.512 --> 44:43.297
Oh, no, that's entirely wrong thinking, completely wrong thinking.

44:43.458 --> 44:45.100
Well, that's a question.

44:45.856 --> 44:50.624
It is true that an Afro-American organization in Oakland heard that I had it.

44:50.964 --> 44:51.986
They were second in line.

44:53.068 --> 45:03.805
I was unaware of their ability to buy, and nor was I familiar with them, but I, under no circumstances, would have refused to sell it to them if I hadn't sold it elsewhere first.

45:05.087 --> 45:12.319
I normally will sell something to the first party in the door unless it's obvious to me that it belongs somewhere else.

45:13.801 --> 45:19.508
Frequently enough, I spend a great deal of time on an archive and offer it to a place which then does not buy it.

45:20.309 --> 45:27.197
So I have no artificial notions that sales are automatic.

45:27.617 --> 45:29.179
Nothing is automatic in the book business.

45:29.820 --> 45:37.809
But what is stable is the sets of relationships between me and my friends and my colleagues, my customers, and the institutions I serve.

45:39.271 --> 45:43.015
In that, I think if I offer something to an institution, the institution will

45:43.450 --> 46:10.181
I assume that I was reasonably certain of their interest and that my description of the material will be sufficient and organized and appropriate and professional enough and that my price will be fair.

46:11.623 --> 46:13.305
I expect institutions to trust me

46:14.180 --> 46:29.522
And just as I expect others to trust me, and repeated instances of trust, I think, are good for character and good for business.

46:30.724 --> 46:34.349
Since it was a sale to a university, do you care to tell me what the purchase price was?

46:34.369 --> 46:36.232
It was under $10,000, as I remember.

46:36.312 --> 46:37.654
Oh, that's cool.

46:38.035 --> 46:43.663
And then, could you briefly describe the correspondence between the two of the Japanese-Americans, since you were mentioning?

46:45.230 --> 46:51.818
The archive again came out of the Berkeley Dump, or systems associated with the Berkeley Dump.

46:51.838 --> 47:08.840
It was a 900-letter correspondence between a young woman in Topaz, Utah, internment camp in 1943 and 1944 and 1945, with her friend David Yamate, another Japanese-American.

47:09.220 --> 47:10.562
He got out before she did.

47:11.386 --> 47:12.828
They wrote each other every day.

47:12.888 --> 47:15.211
When they both got out, they married.

47:15.511 --> 47:22.960
He immediately joined the American Army, as did many Japanese men who were interned, being good Americans.

47:24.102 --> 47:26.605
And they again wrote each other every day, each.

47:28.187 --> 47:32.492
And in the end, he formed an import-export company, which I think was probably successful.

47:32.612 --> 47:34.354
I'm not aware that they had any children.

47:34.995 --> 47:38.980
But in any case, at the end of their lives, the archive was thrown into the dump.

47:40.327 --> 47:49.156
This particular archive was especially moving to me.

47:49.236 --> 47:58.166
I'm a very sentimental person, because there were 20 or 30 or so printed items in the archive.

47:59.367 --> 48:00.669
There were kids in high school.

48:00.689 --> 48:08.697
The high school was inside the Topaz confinement, but it mirrored high school life outside the

48:09.773 --> 48:10.714
internment camp.

48:11.395 --> 48:16.842
They had minimal facilities so that they had a small minecraft machine and smoke on it as a paper.

48:18.324 --> 48:33.042
But nonetheless, they had their harvest hop and their spring dance and their movie trips and their get-to-know-each-other events.

48:34.083 --> 48:39.510
And so in this archive are the very little dance cards and badges by which

48:39.862 --> 48:45.188
the two lovers introduced themselves to each other from the very first day.

48:45.268 --> 48:58.863
So I can actually chart the day they met and how many times he danced with her and given the circumstances and their desperate need to be Americans because they were good Americans.

49:01.506 --> 49:09.835
It's a wonderful epistolary and documentary history of a moment in American history which has not got a lot of glory covering it.

49:10.726 --> 49:18.595
I have this archive for sale for $8,500, and I have it fully catalogued.

49:18.655 --> 49:24.222
Can I get the cataloged entry?

49:25.103 --> 49:27.466
I'll give you a copy of the catalog.

49:27.486 --> 49:28.948
I love the story.

49:29.789 --> 49:36.136
There were also letters from other Japanese in other camps to these kids.

49:36.897 --> 49:39.180
There's the document in which

49:39.785 --> 49:45.803
the boy's father tries to get him to leave America and return to Japan, as the father did, and the boy refuses.

49:46.726 --> 49:49.575
And he doesn't want to be classified as somebody wishing to return.

49:50.804 --> 49:54.911
Well, I'll give you the whole archive.

49:55.752 --> 49:56.613
That's wonderful.

49:56.633 --> 49:58.496
You could actually write a story about that.

49:58.516 --> 50:00.359
Well, it's a good story.

50:00.720 --> 50:02.102
Is there a narrative?

50:02.262 --> 50:04.185
Can you divine a narrative out of the letter?

50:04.205 --> 50:17.166
Well, the letters are between two kids who gradually get older, but they're only 16 years old, and they're not so much philosophers of their situation as

50:17.332 --> 50:29.310
expressing, you know, constancy and devotion to each other amidst what they take routinely as slightly out of the way circumstances.

50:29.770 --> 50:32.254
They are certainly not whining their way through these letters.

50:32.995 --> 50:37.302
And so when you see something like this, what's your first reaction?

50:37.883 --> 50:43.551
My reaction is that it's physically interesting.

50:43.571 --> 50:45.634
To me, the letters have to go through

50:47.150 --> 50:55.840
censorship, so the letters which are mailed from Topaz to Salt Lake City go to Boston and get stamped by the censor and come back to Salt Lake City.

50:56.721 --> 51:03.909
They're interesting to me because I believe it's the largest single correspondence extant, so I think it has a historical and physical importance.

51:03.969 --> 51:08.774
It has an attractiveness in the sense of touch and feel.

51:08.814 --> 51:14.220
It's extremely emotional because it indicates a

51:14.605 --> 51:19.750
an internment in high school life mirroring an outside ideal life, which is ordinary life.

51:21.491 --> 51:29.078
I think it's a model for... I've read John Grishow.

51:31.941 --> 51:36.285
I've read Michael Crytan.

51:36.865 --> 51:38.907
I'm in the middle of an interview here, if you don't mind.

51:39.027 --> 51:40.608
Oh, I'm sorry.

51:40.628 --> 51:43.431
Sorry, it just didn't seem like... Sorry.

51:44.710 --> 51:47.874
I've been on 60 Minutes.

51:47.894 --> 51:48.214
Bye.

51:53.400 --> 52:01.190
This little archive that I got is an interesting archive.

52:01.250 --> 52:04.694
I typed these things up at home on my little portable laptop.

52:08.018 --> 52:09.219
It has its own integrity.

52:09.279 --> 52:13.384
Now I have the responsibility since I split the profit with the source organization.

52:13.837 --> 52:15.759
to which I advance some money.

52:15.779 --> 52:18.341
I have the responsibility of placing and selling the archive.

52:19.482 --> 52:31.394
On the other hand, it was an evening's work and a day's responsibility, and the next day has added responsibilities and opportunities and work.

52:34.196 --> 52:36.038
When I've sold it, I will be content.

52:37.500 --> 52:39.962
I've considered

52:42.271 --> 52:48.279
announcing it in the two or three local Japanese newspapers, but haven't gotten around to it yet.

52:50.282 --> 52:51.483
I love the story.

52:51.503 --> 52:59.414
The Topaz Utah is contemplating a museum, but I think it's not yet off the ground, although they have some letterhead.

52:59.454 --> 53:02.899
They certainly are not yet funded to buy archives.

53:04.241 --> 53:10.489
In the end, I will sell it, but I don't at the moment know to whom it's currently on offer to a major university.

53:12.376 --> 53:22.312
But it's an isolated and individual example of the kinds of things that I do, namely seize upon an opportunity that comes my way.

53:22.352 --> 53:28.722
I've never before had a serious archive from an intern camp.

53:28.782 --> 53:32.588
We all know that intern camp art is uncommon and saleable.

53:32.648 --> 53:39.058
I've had the occasional letter, but I've certainly not had 900 and some letters from before and after.

53:39.663 --> 53:44.910
internment from two people who met in an internment camp, plus all these little printed documents.

53:46.111 --> 54:09.400
So I regard it as a significant and sweet little archive, but it's only one event in my life, and my life is a sequence of unending events of this nature, most of which, if I get involved in them, I

54:12.383 --> 54:28.721
in the end, contrive to successfully complete the cycle and move the item or items on to a more appropriate place, since this is simply a conduit, not an end for anything at all.

54:29.002 --> 54:35.109
Bookselling is strictly a service profession, and it's not a repository.

54:35.149 --> 54:38.152
The bookseller himself is no repository.

54:39.053 --> 54:40.855
It's only a conduit for material.

54:42.573 --> 54:43.955
That's a very important point.

54:46.999 --> 54:48.041
Do you have a prize?

54:48.061 --> 54:49.223
I mean, you're a busy guy.

54:49.243 --> 54:50.204
You have 400,000 books.

54:52.707 --> 55:01.580
Did you ever prize and think, gee, this stuff was five seconds away from being pulped or burned or being buried?

55:01.600 --> 55:11.955
Well, we all think that way about almost everything.

55:13.538 --> 55:20.608
even if it's to the superficial level of a book in a fine dust jacket, that doesn't want to sustain a nick in the jacket.

55:21.349 --> 55:31.964
So many booksellers spend a great deal of time making sure that their perfect copy of a recent or not so recent modern first edition doesn't suffer any harm or further harm.

55:33.166 --> 55:41.217
So the degree and focus of the carrying, not to mention the quality of the carrying, is...

55:42.395 --> 55:43.756
Indigenous to the trade.

55:45.818 --> 55:52.585
Almost everybody in the business cares about the material that they sell or about the condition of the material they sell.

55:54.226 --> 56:04.176
Or to put it another way, the better the bookseller, the more the caring and the less the concern about the financial rewards.

56:04.196 --> 56:08.520
The finances in the book business are the byproduct of service.

56:09.800 --> 56:18.151
The more obviously the finances are the goal of the bookseller, I think the more obvious it is to others.

56:19.073 --> 56:33.192
And such booksellers automatically attract their own kind and carry on from there.

56:33.695 --> 56:39.100
Did you do, personally, any research beyond what you saw in the 900 letters?

56:40.020 --> 56:43.604
No, I tend not to be a great scholar or bookseller under any circumstances.

56:43.844 --> 57:02.520
In this instance, there was a coherence to the material and a sufficiency of inherent knowledge or information given the postmarks and the places they were coming to and from.

57:03.479 --> 57:10.690
and the documentary evidence about what the name of the high school was and what kind of business he went into subsequently.

57:11.491 --> 57:24.951
I didn't have to go research a history of when Topaz as internment camp was formed and when it ended and what the parameters were of a Japanese internment in Western America.

57:26.333 --> 57:29.037
So no, that was not necessary to the task.

57:29.999 --> 57:32.963
I did not write a history of a Japanese internment.

57:33.415 --> 57:41.868
camps from the point of view of high school students involved on the base as a result of my owning this archive.

57:41.888 --> 57:44.852
No, but I mean it was their later lives individually for you at all.

57:45.072 --> 57:45.733
No, I did not.

57:45.813 --> 57:48.818
I have the feeling, the strong feeling, that they're not with us any longer.

57:51.061 --> 58:02.258
And at least, probably, we're... Anybody can track down the lives of recently living Japanese-Americans in San Francisco or in the Bay Area if they're of a mind to.

58:02.997 --> 58:08.083
There was no need for me to do that.

58:08.103 --> 58:09.605
What would you like to see me do?

58:10.546 --> 58:14.691
What do you think would be a valuable, worthwhile exercise for me to pursue?

58:14.711 --> 58:25.725
I would like you to explore the structured life of the antiquarian bookseller from various points of view.

58:29.930 --> 58:31.452
One was emotional life.

58:32.444 --> 58:38.272
Two, his relationships with his colleagues, fellows, and spouses or significant others.

58:39.193 --> 58:41.657
Three, his economic life from beginning to end.

58:41.717 --> 58:44.220
Four, his potential for growth.

58:44.821 --> 58:48.146
Five, his commitment to bookselling and his understanding of it.

58:50.068 --> 59:01.624
Six, his ability to evolve as a bookseller, to change, to develop, or to grow, or to concentrate, and his inclination to do so

59:02.144 --> 59:29.029
the relationship of a bookseller to his book space, and whether he has any desire to be an entity that functions in the community as a bookstore, or if not, why not, and what tendencies there are in the United States for antiquarian booksellers to isolate themselves from the general public in order to survive, whether that's a necessity that they do that in order to survive.

59:30.899 --> 59:56.721
how hard they work and how readily they adapt to the technology that evolves, to what degree booksellers work with local institutions or don't work with local institutions, to what degree areas are defined by the concentric circles of influence that levels and grades of booksellers have,

59:57.764 --> 01:00:18.614
so whether, you know, all the areas of our country in fact have a structured book trade, and what the effect, what the nature of an area where there is not a book trade, or a poor one, or an undeveloped one, or one which is dominated by booksellers who have not been public booksellers.

01:00:19.695 --> 01:00:25.003
I've always felt that Chicago is a very poor book town because it has not had a lot of young booksellers for a long time.

01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:32.648
who are open and active in the streets, they have two great booksellers who were not influential on the younger booksellers of the trade.

01:00:32.668 --> 01:00:35.351
Maybe Nebenzoll and Hamlin Barker.

01:00:36.873 --> 01:00:43.300
They didn't breed, I feel, a lot of younger booksellers, whereas the Bay Area bred an extraordinary number of young booksellers.

01:00:44.661 --> 01:00:49.827
I think because the book trade was open and structured, but that's a history in itself.
