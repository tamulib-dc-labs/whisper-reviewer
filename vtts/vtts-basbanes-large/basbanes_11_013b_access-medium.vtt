00:06.207 --> 00:08.870
What do you do?

00:08.890 --> 00:17.438
Either you say, no, we're not buying today, because you mustn't say, I don't like to look at it, or else you take it in and you try to find out where it came from.

00:19.480 --> 00:22.523
And that sometimes is difficult.

00:22.543 --> 00:30.712
So one very vivid one in my memory is when I got a phone call from Melbourne in Australia from my friend bookseller there.

00:32.333 --> 00:36.197
And he said that somebody had been into his bookstore in Melbourne.

00:37.004 --> 01:03.197
with a lovely book for sale and it had come of course from grandmother's old attic in an old house in Melbourne he said that didn't look right because in it there were a price and the price was the current price of today so it certainly wasn't from an old attic but it had a library played for a name which he didn't know so he rang me

01:04.004 --> 01:09.210
And I happened to go that day to an association meeting.

01:09.231 --> 01:09.731
The committee.

01:09.751 --> 01:12.214
I asked the committee, anybody know his name?

01:12.234 --> 01:15.378
And somebody popped up and said, of course I know this.

01:15.398 --> 01:15.959
This is his collection.

01:15.979 --> 01:18.863
I've just sold him a little bit.

01:18.883 --> 01:21.085
And this was unaccessioned.

01:21.265 --> 01:22.147
It was in the basement.

01:22.807 --> 01:24.970
In the library in Melbourne.

01:25.651 --> 01:27.353
And this young woman was an assistant.

01:28.314 --> 01:29.596
So it hadn't been?

01:29.616 --> 01:31.418
It hadn't been accessioned or stamped.

01:32.880 --> 01:33.741
So that was stopped.

01:34.058 --> 01:38.926
It's not on the records yet.

01:39.347 --> 01:39.948
Exactly.

01:42.712 --> 01:49.864
I was preaching about this meeting in the Lake District.

01:50.405 --> 01:56.455
There was another one where a young man

01:57.194 --> 02:00.799
He had books, beautiful books for sale.

02:00.819 --> 02:09.212
And he came to us, and he came in also to Pickering and Chateau in Panama.

02:09.232 --> 02:13.218
And he was too young to have books of that quality.

02:13.278 --> 02:15.441
Didn't look right.

02:15.461 --> 02:20.789
And the fool of a youngster was wearing a school tie.

02:20.809 --> 02:23.674
And one of the people in Pickering and Chateau recognised the school tie.

02:24.775 --> 02:26.037
See, isn't it amazing?

02:26.320 --> 02:27.442
So he ran the school.

02:30.105 --> 02:38.978
And it turned out straight away, this was another collection that they'd been given that was in a locked up basement store.

02:39.819 --> 02:44.406
And this youngster had been made on Liberia or something, so he had the pick of the place.

02:44.426 --> 02:45.568
But he had this tie.

02:45.628 --> 02:48.011
What a great detail for a perspective story.

02:48.492 --> 02:52.918
So I had him in here then.

02:53.641 --> 03:02.390
I had a new person.

03:02.410 --> 03:10.499
I'm not sure what I did, but I had his headmaster.

03:10.519 --> 03:14.003
What was to be done with this youngster?

03:14.023 --> 03:15.785
And that's a good parent, because I was very concerned about it.

03:15.805 --> 03:16.205
What should they do?

03:16.225 --> 03:17.487
And the story was unbelievable, but the parents were separated.

03:17.507 --> 03:20.430
This youngster knew that money was tight, and that school was extremely expensive.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.332
He thought he could raise some money to help him with the school fees, to help his mother.

03:24.404 --> 03:27.427
But what should be done with him?

03:27.447 --> 03:31.291
And of course the school didn't want to know.

03:31.311 --> 03:31.752
Get him out.

03:32.953 --> 03:35.516
And they probably didn't want a lot of publicity on it either.

03:35.536 --> 03:36.116
Of course not.

03:36.136 --> 03:37.798
So I started thinking the other way.

03:38.178 --> 03:42.443
What about the soul of that young man who was to hand to him?

03:42.463 --> 03:46.467
Could he be saved?

03:46.487 --> 03:51.372
But it's probably better just to get rid of him.

03:51.392 --> 03:52.133
Very, very difficult indeed.

03:55.960 --> 03:58.002
No, I think they got shot of him.

03:58.022 --> 03:58.723
I'd be sure they did.

04:00.345 --> 04:02.908
Well, let's face it.

04:03.009 --> 04:04.931
It was not an innocent thing that he did.

04:05.391 --> 04:07.013
It wasn't innocent.

04:07.033 --> 04:07.254
No.

04:08.355 --> 04:10.478
I mean, it's theft, no matter how.

04:11.319 --> 04:18.307
Of course, you've heard that now all the libraries in Russia, formerly the Soviet Union, that stuff is being plundered now.

04:18.427 --> 04:21.511
I mean, public libraries.

04:21.551 --> 04:22.232
Yes.

04:22.252 --> 04:23.613
It's unbelievable.

04:23.633 --> 04:24.094
And where is it?

04:25.576 --> 04:28.440
being sold, I guess, outside of where the money is.

04:28.460 --> 04:30.142
By whom?

04:30.162 --> 04:32.886
Probably from people who worked in there, you know, who knows.

04:33.827 --> 04:36.230
But I just saw a piece from the New York Times.

04:36.391 --> 04:38.894
Does it have stamps?

04:38.914 --> 04:41.437
You see, I'm, I don't know that.

04:41.457 --> 04:49.328
Probably it does, but probably doing the same thing as the... Am I now to get a portrait of you if it's... No, I don't want you to dress up or anything.

04:49.348 --> 04:53.173
I don't know whether it was, whether I got the right lens on and thought that I'm going to try.

04:53.253 --> 04:54.435
Oh, yes, that's all right, that's okay.

04:54.837 --> 04:56.759
It's an automatic, so there's no trouble.

04:57.660 --> 05:00.563
Switch on.

05:00.583 --> 05:03.767
See what happens.

05:03.787 --> 05:05.169
Oh, the rounds.

05:05.589 --> 05:06.570
That's better.

05:06.590 --> 05:08.853
There it is.

05:08.873 --> 05:10.374
I'm no good at doing this.

05:11.255 --> 05:12.377
Well, that proves I was here.

05:15.500 --> 05:19.705
But, no, you've done a very interesting book there, and you haven't been murdered yet.

05:21.347 --> 05:24.270
Because your investigation on that was pretty serious.

05:24.689 --> 05:27.192
It was a bit scary.

05:27.392 --> 05:29.113
It was, and we heard from him, you know.

05:29.534 --> 05:31.055
Because you are an attorney, aren't you?

05:31.115 --> 05:32.197
No, I'm not.

05:32.217 --> 05:32.977
I'm a journalist.

05:33.738 --> 05:35.119
I've done investigative work.

05:35.240 --> 05:35.560
Yes.

05:36.341 --> 05:38.883
You read, didn't you, about a woman journalist in Ireland?

05:39.464 --> 05:39.724
No.

05:40.425 --> 05:42.987
And she investigated too much, and they got her.

05:43.007 --> 05:45.510
Well, that's not likely to hand happen with Haven.

05:48.173 --> 05:50.595
But we heard from him afterwards.

05:51.571 --> 05:53.814
He threatened to sue me for fifteen million dollars.

05:53.834 --> 05:56.498
Now, what about Arnold Fawkes?

05:56.518 --> 05:59.241
This is a new name of me.

05:59.462 --> 05:59.782
F-A-W-C-U-S.

06:01.424 --> 06:02.225
Arnold Fawkes.

06:02.886 --> 06:04.348
Do you know all about the Trianon Press?

06:05.470 --> 06:05.710
No.

06:06.171 --> 06:07.853
Who was printing the books?

06:07.873 --> 06:08.394
Oh, sure.

06:08.594 --> 06:10.236
For Sir Jeffrey Keynes.

06:10.276 --> 06:11.117
That's right, yeah.

06:12.079 --> 06:16.144
And Arnold Fawkes was the printer, trading as the Trianon Press.

06:16.625 --> 06:18.968
Mm-hmm.

06:18.988 --> 06:19.148
And

06:20.849 --> 06:29.719
He's one of the most colorful characters of this last sort of 30 years.

06:29.739 --> 06:30.741
He's a publisher.

06:30.761 --> 06:31.121
Printer?

06:31.501 --> 06:36.287
He was the man who had the posh wire printing in a house.

06:37.508 --> 06:46.679
And it was always said, I don't know if it was true, it was said that in the war he'd been a secret agent working for both sides at once, which could have been.

06:46.699 --> 06:47.720
But he produced those.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.683
You've seen all the Trianon first, haven't you?

06:49.703 --> 06:50.063
I have.

06:50.397 --> 06:54.141
I know it by reputation, but I don't... They were beautiful.

06:54.802 --> 06:55.924
They were poshoire.

06:56.484 --> 06:58.426
You know what that is.

06:58.446 --> 06:59.508
You should explain it for us.

07:00.008 --> 07:03.472
Where the colouring is basically hand.

07:04.974 --> 07:07.537
Through stencils.

07:07.557 --> 07:10.961
And so they're almost the same as originals.

07:12.663 --> 07:14.505
Very, very time consuming and tedious.

07:15.747 --> 07:16.708
But beautifully done.

07:18.663 --> 07:20.105
Is this a dying art?

07:20.125 --> 07:20.425
Yes.

07:21.386 --> 07:23.689
I'm also interested in the book arts, too.

07:23.709 --> 07:26.812
He died in France, I think.

07:26.833 --> 07:27.533
Time-consuming.

07:28.935 --> 07:31.618
And then, have you been into Joe Stodden?

07:31.638 --> 07:31.818
No.

07:32.819 --> 07:35.843
Editions, Alecto, A-L-E-C-T-O.

07:37.044 --> 07:39.447
Because I would like to direct you to him.

07:39.467 --> 07:41.830
Editions, Alecto, A-L-E-C-T-O.

07:41.910 --> 07:43.071
Unless you're in London.

07:43.292 --> 07:43.552
Yes.

07:43.792 --> 07:44.573
And his name again?

07:44.974 --> 07:47.877
Stodden, Stoddholm, S-T-U-D-H-O-L-N-E.

07:49.679 --> 07:54.026
And he had that incredible project.

07:54.107 --> 07:57.232
I'm sorry, I'm back to Captain Cook again.

07:57.252 --> 08:09.533
But when Cook was all that wrecked on the barrier reef in Queensland, he had to get the ship ashore while she was repaired.

08:10.234 --> 08:14.421
And all his botanists went off botanising.

08:15.413 --> 08:22.660
And they came back with wonderful watercolors, bringing up all the wonderful plants they'd seen which were new to science.

08:23.281 --> 08:29.007
And anyway, these drawings all got back to London and all the others that he'd made on the voyage.

08:31.049 --> 08:37.255
And Joseph Banks decided that they had got to be engraved.

08:37.275 --> 08:45.403
And so he got his engravers on doing the most fabulous work of engraving from one of these drawings.

08:46.160 --> 08:50.384
He died without a book ever being done properly.

08:50.404 --> 08:55.269
And the drawings were saved and passed into the Natural History Museum in London.

08:55.289 --> 09:04.578
And finally, they gave the assignment to this chap Studham, edition of Alecto Studham, which he called the Banks Flora Legion.

09:04.618 --> 09:05.539
Surely you've heard of that?

09:05.839 --> 09:06.079
Yes.

09:06.219 --> 09:09.162
In fact, there was a biography of Banks just a few years ago.

09:09.282 --> 09:15.188
Well, the Banks Flora Legion, the most ambitious publishing venture perhaps since the war,

09:15.775 --> 09:16.456
And he did it.

09:16.736 --> 09:17.337
And he did it.

09:18.918 --> 09:22.161
And they are like, you can pick them off.

09:22.241 --> 09:24.304
They're so real.

09:24.324 --> 09:26.446
I've never had one.

09:26.566 --> 09:31.611
I've had them through as specimens, but I've never had one for stock that are far too expensive.

09:32.712 --> 09:37.797
And in all the great libraries around the world, you see them.

09:37.877 --> 09:40.720
Wasn't it, who did a wonderful biography of him?

09:41.915 --> 09:44.018
Wasn't Patrick O'Brien the novelist?

09:44.058 --> 09:45.440
Didn't he do something?

09:45.560 --> 09:47.282
I'd rather think it was.

09:47.522 --> 09:48.604
I think it was.

09:48.624 --> 09:48.764
Yes.

09:48.784 --> 09:51.407
It was a wonderful, wonderful book on him.

09:51.427 --> 09:52.909
But Alecto.

09:53.310 --> 09:53.930
Alecto.

09:53.950 --> 09:54.972
And he's here in London.

09:54.992 --> 09:55.813
He's here in London.

09:55.893 --> 09:57.675
And he's at just a few streets over here.

09:58.657 --> 10:02.421
But you ought to go into his office and just see.

10:03.423 --> 10:05.906
And that's another of these things up there above your head.

10:06.266 --> 10:06.667
Oh, wow.

10:06.967 --> 10:07.568
Maximilian.

10:09.387 --> 10:10.588
if always to North America.

10:10.749 --> 10:12.611
So what street would that be on, do you think?

10:12.691 --> 10:13.412
It's on Sackville.

10:14.393 --> 10:16.095
Say CK, Sackville.

10:16.175 --> 10:23.043
Sackville, and it's just beside the entrance to Sotherham's Bookshop.

10:24.825 --> 10:25.306
Sotherham.

10:26.787 --> 10:28.469
You're a font of information.

10:30.191 --> 10:30.712
Excellent.

10:31.413 --> 10:35.918
And that is the most amazing story, this chap, that's a million.

10:37.180 --> 10:40.023
went through North America as a German potentate.

10:40.944 --> 10:45.649
You can see his track there, going by canoe, mostly.

10:46.370 --> 10:48.633
And he took a Swiss artist with him called Bodmer.

10:48.653 --> 10:49.093
That's magnificent.

10:49.373 --> 10:51.436
Do you know all this story or not?

10:51.456 --> 10:52.557
No, I don't think.

10:53.258 --> 10:59.565
And Bodmer made drawings, what kind of drawings of the Indians, and so on, everywhere they went.

10:59.645 --> 11:01.106
And this was the Indians as they were.

11:01.847 --> 11:02.848
I know about the Indians.

11:02.888 --> 11:05.391
I didn't know about this, but I know about the Bodmer around.

11:05.411 --> 11:06.312
The Bodmer paintings around.

11:06.352 --> 11:06.672
That's right.

11:06.693 --> 11:07.153
This is it.

11:07.454 --> 11:19.967
And there, all the copper plates were still extant in the family castle in Germany and were bought and are now in Omaha, Nebraska.

11:21.368 --> 11:21.749
Omaha?

11:21.769 --> 11:23.330
What's in Omaha?

11:23.350 --> 11:25.192
It's life insurance, isn't it?

11:26.453 --> 11:26.814
Wow.

11:28.575 --> 11:32.700
And having not been kept up to this story, because it is so wonderful.

11:34.401 --> 11:36.043
And so they sent

11:37.070 --> 11:44.556
they authorised Joe Stodden, a director, to republish these fond copper plates.

11:45.017 --> 11:48.480
Not reprints, but restrikes.

11:48.500 --> 11:48.920
Wow.

11:50.241 --> 11:51.862
And they are so beautiful.

11:51.942 --> 11:53.043
And he did that right over here?

11:53.203 --> 11:53.464
Yes.

11:53.484 --> 11:54.905
Is this where the presses are?

11:55.385 --> 11:57.827
The presses have, I think, been dispersed now.

12:03.012 --> 12:03.672
But, wonderful then.

12:03.872 --> 12:06.975
Have you been given a note about the

12:10.600 --> 12:39.342
a monotype corporation that went down the drain because nobody wants monotype anymore and so Nicholas Barker whom you must know of Croatia raised money for the purchase of all their relics and he's found a home in South London where all this equipment and the type is there being preserved

12:40.553 --> 12:45.539
And it's the most amazing story, but he's desperate to raise more money for it.

12:46.040 --> 12:46.841
He wants angels.

12:47.922 --> 12:49.184
He needs angels for that.

12:49.204 --> 12:49.684
To provide funding.

12:49.704 --> 12:56.693
I'm surprised some of the newspapers don't... If you can tap them, that's the point.

12:58.215 --> 12:59.577
But, yes, the Monotype Corporation.

13:00.999 --> 13:06.105
There's a wonderful press, with old presses and type, at the University of Toronto.

13:06.220 --> 13:13.155
I spent three days up there, and this project is fascinating.

13:14.217 --> 13:17.084
And I'm also very close with the R.O.M.

13:17.104 --> 13:19.809
That's right, which is marvelous.

13:19.830 --> 13:22.114
It's a live-wire institution, that.

13:24.840 --> 13:26.524
Well, but, um, yes.

13:26.842 --> 13:29.505
Are you going to be interviewing Nicholas Barker?

13:29.525 --> 13:31.107
I don't know if I'm going to see him this trip.

13:31.168 --> 13:32.069
I interviewed him.

13:32.089 --> 13:33.891
You have to run fast to catch him.

13:33.971 --> 13:35.814
He's a hard man to get in touch with.

13:35.854 --> 13:39.779
I wrote him, and I did see him in Los Angeles last year.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.302
He gave me a talk that I gave, and I did interview him.

13:42.322 --> 13:47.989
You came alongside, that's why I could, because he was talking at this same meeting in the Lake District where I was.

13:49.791 --> 13:52.996
Have you heard of a collector named Jack Lundzer around?

13:53.016 --> 13:55.118
He must say, yes.

13:55.439 --> 13:56.460
Val Madonna.

13:56.828 --> 13:58.870
Val Madonna.

13:58.890 --> 14:03.234
Val Madonna is the, it's a Jewish thing.

14:03.255 --> 14:04.636
I hear it's pretty spectacular.

14:04.656 --> 14:06.177
It's almost like a museum, isn't it?

14:06.197 --> 14:07.098
He's a diamond merchant.

14:07.118 --> 14:11.042
He's a diamond merchant out of South Africa, is that right?

14:11.583 --> 14:11.863
Maybe.

14:11.883 --> 14:12.764
Probably so.

14:13.805 --> 14:14.906
But he's a bit secretive.

14:15.106 --> 14:16.108
I heard that, yeah.

14:16.128 --> 14:17.349
He buys very much through salaries.

14:19.951 --> 14:21.253
I got on the fringes of it.

14:21.273 --> 14:22.834
I haven't done any business with him, really.

14:23.495 --> 14:24.736
Yes, I have met him.

14:24.756 --> 14:26.498
I mean, is that...

14:29.971 --> 14:32.076
tipped that.

14:32.096 --> 14:34.120
That was diamonds.

14:37.187 --> 14:38.009
You're kidding.

14:38.671 --> 14:42.279
Valmadonna is called, but it's very mysterious.

14:42.600 --> 14:45.446
Of the organisation, yes.

14:47.371 --> 14:48.874
It's a foundation, or what it is.

14:49.192 --> 14:53.196
So they don't let people in to see the collection, so far as you know.

14:53.296 --> 14:56.680
I don't know where the collection is, actually, but I know he has some of his books in London.

14:57.401 --> 14:58.362
But he's a mystery now.

14:58.382 --> 15:07.091
But you see, the trouble is now burglary as such that you've got to go behind, in his case, steel doors, because you're so scared.

15:07.532 --> 15:08.953
And I'm not going to quote you at all on this.

15:08.973 --> 15:10.715
And the golden rule, of course, is never talk to the press.

15:11.236 --> 15:11.937
Of course, yeah.

15:12.097 --> 15:13.238
Because they are enemies.

15:14.760 --> 15:17.022
But I heard that this is a fascinating collection.

15:17.660 --> 15:20.084
It will be extensively Jewish.

15:20.785 --> 15:22.708
But probably one of the best.

15:22.748 --> 15:24.170
Yes, exactly.

15:24.190 --> 15:25.773
And I think it's artifacts as well.

15:25.933 --> 15:26.854
But very secretive.

15:27.615 --> 15:29.899
Which, of course, makes me very interested.

15:30.139 --> 15:30.380
Exactly.

15:31.882 --> 15:33.645
Yes, I'm privileged to have met him.

15:33.665 --> 15:33.965
Really?

15:35.628 --> 15:36.389
Youngish man?

15:36.449 --> 15:40.536
No, no.

15:40.576 --> 15:41.457
My sort of contemporaries.

15:42.787 --> 15:44.250
Can you think of any other questions?

15:44.290 --> 15:48.197
Well, you've been so kind with your time service, you've given us an hour and a half already.

15:49.800 --> 15:50.561
Look, I enjoy it.

15:52.745 --> 16:00.780
But, do you know, I read your book at once, and the quotations that you put down to me, and you know what I said to myself?

16:01.642 --> 16:03.305
Well, I don't remember this interview at all.

16:04.106 --> 16:06.651
But I said, if

16:08.167 --> 16:11.052
If it was really real, that's exactly what I would have said.

16:11.212 --> 16:12.193
I sat right here.

16:12.514 --> 16:13.275
I have the tapes.

16:13.355 --> 16:14.497
I use this machine.

16:14.517 --> 16:18.744
Well, that's it, because they're typical things that I would have said, so I thought it must have been right.

16:18.844 --> 16:21.608
I could never come up with the books were thick on the ground.

16:21.828 --> 16:25.995
I mean, that's nothing I would ever... I don't trust the press.

16:27.557 --> 16:29.060
Have you met Sheila Markham?

16:29.400 --> 16:29.600
No.

16:30.402 --> 16:31.844
She writes for this.

16:33.146 --> 16:34.989
You know this journal, I hope.

16:35.009 --> 16:35.710
Oh, right.

16:35.875 --> 16:37.077
That's a British journal.

16:37.097 --> 16:37.718
Yes.

16:37.758 --> 16:38.839
We have a similar one.

16:39.079 --> 16:40.541
No, you couldn't have.

16:40.561 --> 16:41.583
I don't know.

16:41.763 --> 16:43.746
This is absolutely marvelous.

16:44.347 --> 16:55.302
And there is the story of one of the most horrible things to have happened in this last ten or more years of an auction sale in South Africa.

16:55.322 --> 16:57.164
And the property was being sold by Bight.

16:57.625 --> 17:00.328
I want to give you a photo copy of that piece.

17:00.348 --> 17:01.450
That would be great.

17:01.510 --> 17:04.414
Because this is the story to rock the boat

17:06.352 --> 17:17.564
And the thing had sold, and the hammer fell, and it was bought by the bookseller in Johannesburg, who was a good friend of mine, who was used to be a lawyer as well.

17:17.584 --> 17:20.828
And then having sold it, there was a fuss.

17:21.969 --> 17:26.314
And another lawyer in the sale room said, no, I was bidding on that, sir.

17:26.334 --> 17:27.595
But he wasn't.

17:27.615 --> 17:28.316
He was too late.

17:29.677 --> 17:33.962
But being the important man he was, he ultimately reopened the bill,

17:36.052 --> 17:38.595
very, very, very important thing.

17:39.736 --> 17:43.020
And so it was put up again.

17:43.140 --> 17:46.725
And so his bookseller bought it again the second time.

17:48.106 --> 17:48.887
And he bought.

17:48.907 --> 17:52.071
And he then claimed that it was his.

17:52.091 --> 17:58.078
And he attempted to pay the bill at the first price.

17:58.098 --> 18:03.865
But Miss Sarah was a multi-millionaire bride who was now dead.

18:03.885 --> 18:04.506
So he went to law.

18:05.245 --> 18:06.186
And it went to appeal.

18:07.707 --> 18:09.950
And finally now, the bookseller has lost the case.

18:10.030 --> 18:11.511
He lost the case.

18:11.531 --> 18:14.674
Whether it's going to cost him a quarter of a million or what, I don't know.

18:14.694 --> 18:15.835
Probably a lot of money.

18:15.855 --> 18:17.837
But he still was successful in both bits.

18:17.857 --> 18:20.019
He'll now have to pay the higher price, I assume.

18:20.460 --> 18:22.242
Or maybe he's lost the wholesale entirely.

18:22.702 --> 18:25.925
So just what the status of the stuff is, I don't know.

18:25.945 --> 18:29.208
But this is a thing we're very worried about, is the fall of a hammer.

18:29.889 --> 18:31.090
Because it now is meaningless.

18:31.871 --> 18:35.134
And some of it, in their wisdom, you buy it.

18:35.502 --> 18:36.824
Bam, the hammer has fallen.

18:37.624 --> 18:44.312
Five minutes later, the auctioneer says, oh, sorry, Elsie, you made a mistake here about that block five minutes ago.

18:44.372 --> 18:45.053
They do that?

18:45.233 --> 18:45.454
Yeah.

18:46.475 --> 18:48.337
And I'm within my rights to put it up again.

18:49.078 --> 18:49.698
It's against you.

18:50.800 --> 18:53.082
And he said, and you said, no, sir, I bought it.

18:53.102 --> 18:54.324
That's mine.

18:54.344 --> 18:56.106
No, I'm within my rights to re-offer it.

18:56.246 --> 18:58.449
So it's still continuing and so on.

19:00.150 --> 19:04.075
And they tried this on one of the biggest art dealers in Barn Street.

19:05.354 --> 19:06.456
And they contested it.

19:07.617 --> 19:10.481
And they said, no, we bought it, and we're paying that first price.

19:12.224 --> 19:13.526
So it's all that it's about to sue them.

19:14.768 --> 19:17.471
And it went on to go to the House of Lords.

19:18.373 --> 19:19.895
At that point, it's all that it's got to worry.

19:20.756 --> 19:21.337
So they settled.

19:21.798 --> 19:24.762
That's right, because if they lose, that's quite a precedent.

19:24.782 --> 19:25.763
They don't want a precedent.

19:26.204 --> 19:28.908
Because it's case law, and they don't want that.

19:28.928 --> 19:29.128
No.

19:29.889 --> 19:33.775
They'd much rather intimidate you the way they are doing now.

19:34.160 --> 19:39.467
And so now is this case running on the BBC, which you've been following from to?

19:40.288 --> 19:41.971
No, they will get the BBC.

19:42.551 --> 19:44.374
This extraordinary thing.

19:44.394 --> 20:00.696
One of some of his staff, or even senior staff, shocked them, as the expression is, and threatened to explode and expose what was going on inside the place.

20:00.716 --> 20:01.938
That's a great story.

20:01.958 --> 20:03.660
And so they put him in the court.

20:04.400 --> 20:18.620
in the Crown Court.

20:18.640 --> 20:23.426
It was hushed up anyway.

20:23.446 --> 20:28.393
But then the television got onto it and a particular journalist, Lala Hugh, and he wrote the thing up and they made a television program out of it.

20:29.394 --> 20:32.078
So several of his directors were suspended

20:32.783 --> 20:37.388
This was to do with illegal export of antiquities from Italy.

20:39.290 --> 20:40.872
Well, that's a big story, yeah.

20:40.992 --> 20:46.157
So they set up, the television people set it up as an inquiry process.

20:46.177 --> 20:47.118
We do know this story.

20:47.138 --> 20:50.002
And they had a television camera.

20:50.742 --> 20:51.203
That's right.

20:51.363 --> 20:54.246
The young woman had a television camera in her brooch.

20:55.808 --> 20:57.930
So they went round places and they filmed it.

20:59.328 --> 21:00.789
Dirty business altogether.

21:01.290 --> 21:03.112
We did have, the New York Times did cover that.

21:03.132 --> 21:04.213
We'll have covered that one.

21:04.233 --> 21:05.534
Yeah, we effectively flipped it.

21:06.896 --> 21:09.858
It isn't finished yet, and the book is now coming out.

21:10.199 --> 21:12.781
It could be a dirty business.

21:14.323 --> 21:28.457
We had an association meeting on this, and the feeling was very strong that be careful how you handle this one, because you may think it's going to knock some of these, but it will knock everybody.

21:29.669 --> 21:31.371
because all this dirty business.

21:32.632 --> 21:44.243
And so our chairman that evening looked round the room and said, I suppose there's nobody in this room really who could say totally honestly that they've never done anything wrong.

21:44.263 --> 21:52.151
Such as when somebody comes in here wanting to buy something and they've got a roll of banknotes.

21:52.171 --> 21:53.552
I've had that.

21:53.572 --> 21:54.633
Where do the banknotes come from?

21:54.653 --> 21:59.338
Put the roll of banknotes on the table, would that help to influence your decision?

21:59.588 --> 22:07.141
Well, you're desperate for money, and here's this roll of money.

22:07.161 --> 22:18.981
And you still say no, but it's a little bit like a pretty girl in Piccadilly.

22:19.653 --> 22:22.177
You said the woman's name is Sheila Markham, is that?

22:22.197 --> 22:25.882
Sheila Markham, yes, and she's a columnist for the book dealer.

22:25.902 --> 22:29.967
But you ought, you know, to, I think, speak to Barry Shaw.

22:31.570 --> 22:33.613
Who's the owner of this thing?

22:33.633 --> 22:34.414
Of that magazine?

22:34.534 --> 22:34.814
Yes.

22:35.635 --> 22:39.381
It's principally, of course, of Books Wanted.

22:40.082 --> 22:42.405
But he puts this wonderful editorial.

22:43.366 --> 22:49.475
Let's see if I can... Yes.

22:49.495 --> 22:49.575
Yes.

22:52.829 --> 22:54.152
I'll do a photo copy of that for you.

22:54.593 --> 22:55.134
That'd be great.

22:55.255 --> 22:59.765
But Danny Shaw is a really good man.

22:59.785 --> 23:02.812
Well, this is the kind of man who could do a scene inside.

23:03.193 --> 23:05.338
But he's a rival journalist, remember.

23:05.358 --> 23:06.020
I'm writing a book.

23:06.060 --> 23:08.786
I'm not writing for, you know, David.

23:08.867 --> 23:11.192
Let's just give you a photo copy of it.
