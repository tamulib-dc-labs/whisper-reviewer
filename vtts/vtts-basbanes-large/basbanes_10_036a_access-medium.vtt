WEBVTT

00:02.393 --> 00:04.375
Okay, we're talking to Dr. Owen Gingrich.

00:05.416 --> 00:06.637
It's working and it's fine.

00:07.537 --> 00:20.068
You know, we've talked before, and of course the title of this book is The Great Copernicus Chase, and I'm really fascinated about, and by your fascination, with this one book.

00:20.629 --> 00:32.299
And of course you give me a lot of background in the essay in here, but tell me a little bit, I mean, why is it so important for you to find not only every copy, but to try and determine...

00:32.566 --> 00:35.729
the people who read it through the centuries, actually.

00:37.571 --> 00:53.548
Well, there was a challenge thrown out by Arthur Kessler in his The Sleepwalkers, in which he has entitled a section, The Book Nobody Read, and describes Copernicus's book as the all-time worst seller.

00:54.209 --> 01:02.117
And I started out on the project assuming that was more or less correct, and it turned out, over a period of years,

01:02.367 --> 01:13.760
evidence was piling up that that was a very wrong view of things, and so it wasn't that I set out to prove Arthur Kessler wrong.

01:14.140 --> 01:15.501
It's just how it worked out.

01:17.604 --> 01:21.628
Doing something like that gets a momentum of its own.

01:22.289 --> 01:32.340
I started out by knowing that we were going to celebrate the 500th anniversary of Copernicus in 1973, and he had been

01:32.557 --> 01:38.945
examined for so long, it seemed to me that it was going to be hard for me to add anything new to it.

01:41.568 --> 01:57.248
So, I had this incident in Scotland, or on my way up to Scotland, talking with a colleague who was also on the planning committee for the Copernican celebrations about

01:58.122 --> 02:05.449
Well, maybe there are more people alive today who've read Copernicus's book in these great book programs than in all of the 16th century.

02:06.269 --> 02:21.022
And we thought maybe we could count on the fingers of two hands the people who have read the book intelligently than the very next copy of the book I found, which was in the Crawford collection.

02:21.483 --> 02:27.268
And that's something I thought was very much missing from your book, one of the great

02:27.738 --> 02:36.972
the greatest private library established in the last century was the Lindeciana, and you say practically nothing about it.

02:38.674 --> 02:41.699
We're writing another book so we can redress our earth.

02:41.719 --> 02:41.919
Okay.

02:42.921 --> 02:45.064
Throw it out so that you can do it.

02:45.084 --> 02:48.810
If you want to digress a little bit, tell me a little bit about it and what else.

02:48.830 --> 02:50.873
I'll pick up this other story later then.

02:53.998 --> 02:57.002
Lord Crawford, who is one of the leading earls of

02:57.387 --> 03:19.220
Scotland, started in as building a book collection, and then his son, and I think that's the 26th Earl, became more and more taken up with this, and they established a truly incredible library.

03:19.741 --> 03:23.226
But the 26th Earl was also an amateur astronomer.

03:23.746 --> 03:31.314
And his observatory was better outfitted than most professional observatories could afford to be in those days.

03:32.275 --> 03:53.719
So, he had a wonderful collection of astronomy books, and he was rather dismayed when it was decided not to reappoint an Astronomer Royal of Scotland, in part because the person who had been in

03:53.952 --> 04:07.550
that position so long had been very ingenious, but in the end became more and more interested in pyramidology and a few things like that, and he brought some level of disrepute to the position.

04:08.071 --> 04:17.023
But Lord Crawford decided that he would give all his instruments and his astronomy book collection to Scotland, provided there

04:17.763 --> 04:19.786
Well, he didn't put any provisions in.

04:19.826 --> 04:23.431
He gave the whole thing with just a little note.

04:24.172 --> 04:38.774
The implication was, and he was busy talking this up with the Secretary of State and others, the implication was, you better, you know, make sure that we have a national observatory in Scotland, and here's the nucleus for doing it.

04:40.597 --> 04:47.567
So, these books constitute a fabulous astronomical collection, and

04:48.121 --> 04:55.768
But the rest of their collection, which is in multiple volumes in the Bibliotheca Lindeciana.

04:56.950 --> 04:59.592
And that is where?

04:59.612 --> 05:11.364
It is, well, there are various volumes that commemorate it, but the collection has been broken up.

05:11.464 --> 05:18.010
For example, the Oriental Manuscripts, which was a fabulous collection, have gone to

05:18.344 --> 05:25.193
the Rylands Library and formed the basis for their Oriental collection.

05:26.454 --> 05:30.119
That was part of that original purchase that Mrs. Rylands bought?

05:30.139 --> 05:31.481
That was the Spencer collection.

05:31.501 --> 05:32.482
That was the Spencer.

05:32.502 --> 05:41.193
I understand that, but I thought there were some components given, donated by Lord Crawford.

05:42.374 --> 05:46.900
They had sort of the world's leading collection of Bibles for some time.

05:47.318 --> 05:51.062
But eventually, the collection got dispersed.

05:51.082 --> 06:04.595
So I think they were coal and iron magnates, and when the market sort of collapsed, they sold off some things, including their Gutenberg Bible.

06:05.035 --> 06:07.518
But originally, that was part of the collection.

06:08.178 --> 06:14.845
The present Lloyd Crawford has still got a remarkable collection of Bibles, but it doesn't have some of those high spots anymore.

06:15.162 --> 06:18.266
So, to get back to the train in Edinburgh.

06:18.286 --> 06:36.508
I went up there to, since I was going to Edinburgh, I stopped in at the Royal Observatory to see the Crawford Collection, which at that time was kept in a couple of large safes, sort of three deep in the books.

06:36.568 --> 06:41.895
It was, they were not easy to see, but basically these books had been just on the open shelves

06:42.145 --> 06:43.887
all the way up through World War II.

06:44.288 --> 06:49.135
And then they decided, wait a minute, these books are much too valuable to be out here in the open.

06:49.475 --> 06:52.660
And the incredible thing is, as far as I know, they never lost anything.

06:52.700 --> 06:54.382
That's truly amazing.

06:56.225 --> 07:11.646
But I looked at the Copernicus book, and this first edition was annotated from beginning to end by somebody who clearly knew what he was doing, and it seemed to me completely unlikely that if

07:12.453 --> 07:17.481
So few people had read the book, the very next copy I would see would be so well annotated.

07:18.002 --> 07:31.605
So, I really scratched my head on that one, and then decided that in some incredible way, this was the copy of one of the ten people we had mentioned, and that's how it turned out to be.

07:32.106 --> 07:39.017
It was the copy of Erasmus Reinhold, who was the preeminent

07:39.875 --> 07:43.900
astronomer teacher in the generation following Copernicus.

07:44.921 --> 07:57.275
And so he was working this book through very carefully, and he set into motion a whole tradition of teaching about Copernicus within the Lutheran university system.

07:57.655 --> 08:01.139
Reinhold was at Wittenberg, the central Lutheran place.

08:02.480 --> 08:09.308
I decided at that moment that, aha, here is something I could do

08:09.473 --> 08:13.497
which might cast some further light on Copernicus, which nobody has done.

08:14.098 --> 08:25.009
Namely, look at a number of copies and see what kind of annotations are in to get an idea of how people were looking at the book and how they were studying it in the 16th century.

08:25.029 --> 08:29.934
And of course, this presupposes your own expertise.

08:30.314 --> 08:34.799
This is not something for a layman scholar, a researcher to do.

08:34.819 --> 08:37.742
I mean, you have to bring tremendous baggage to this kind of

08:37.992 --> 08:39.994
You have to appreciate what these annotations are.

08:40.014 --> 08:41.516
You have to be able to.

08:41.536 --> 08:47.021
Well, this was the beginning of a long learning experience, which started right there at the Royal Observatory.

08:47.502 --> 08:53.288
Namely, it had a blind-stamped pigskin binding and no name in the book.

08:53.308 --> 08:55.570
I was really hard put to figure out whose it was.

08:55.951 --> 08:59.855
And then I saw the initials, E-R, stamped in the binding.

08:59.915 --> 09:02.257
And I said, aha, Erasmus Reinhold.

09:02.277 --> 09:04.860
So I grabbed a piece of paper to make a rubbing.

09:05.144 --> 09:26.564
And when I made the rubbing, it came out E-R-S, which at that moment deflated me, because I was so naive, I had no clue that the way people stamp their names in books was not only their name, but where they're from, Erasmus Reinholdus Salveldiensis, his hometown.

09:28.105 --> 09:33.430
So, it was all right for Reinhold, but that was the first thing I learned about

09:33.916 --> 09:35.659
16th century bookbinding.

09:37.502 --> 09:53.752
And then I had eventually to learn about heraldry in order to decipher book plates, and I had to learn about watermarks and about how to distinguish bindings and so on.

09:53.792 --> 09:57.679
It was quite a whole series of

09:58.148 --> 10:00.071
bookish things I had to learn.

10:00.191 --> 10:07.340
So what precisely would you say you learned from these annotations?

10:07.360 --> 10:27.227
In the Reinhold copy, what I discovered was that he was terribly interested in the details of the planetary mechanisms and not at all interested in the cosmology of throwing the earth into motion and fixing the sun in the center, which is what we consider the great breakthrough of Copernicus's work,

10:27.578 --> 10:41.096
And that was of secondary importance to Reinhold, who liked the idea that Copernicus had eliminated one of the Ptolemaic mechanisms that he considered unaesthetic.

10:42.719 --> 10:53.974
So it was a totally different way of looking at it, and it turns out that this is absolutely vital for understanding what was going on in the acceptance of the Copernican theory in the 16th century.

10:54.393 --> 11:04.125
Namely, it wasn't until the very end of the century with Kepler and Galileo that people began to say, hey, guys, this is a real system.

11:04.145 --> 11:06.948
This is how the physical world really is.

11:07.449 --> 11:09.812
This isn't just playing mathematical games.

11:10.152 --> 11:19.303
So in a very real way, this copy of this printed book provided a window for you, didn't it, into the thought and the thinking of that time?

11:20.330 --> 11:21.071
Absolutely.

11:22.232 --> 11:23.594
How often can something like this happen?

11:23.614 --> 11:28.701
The supreme irony is that the first book I saw was the best.

11:30.003 --> 11:42.339
In searching for over 500 more copies, which I've looked at, there isn't another book that matches it in terms of insights and quality.

11:42.359 --> 11:47.265
But that's not to say there weren't lots of other interesting surprises along the way.

11:47.768 --> 11:50.551
Well, I mean, of course, you were spoiled by this first one.

11:51.372 --> 11:56.359
What other things did you think that you might have been able to find, what you're hoping you might find?

11:56.379 --> 12:03.668
Well, at the outset, you would expect at least some people to say, this crazy, mixed-up guy is throwing the whole world out of kilter.

12:04.308 --> 12:06.932
But you don't get comments like that.

12:06.952 --> 12:15.102
The closest you get is a series of comments in the margin that say, here, Copernicus is dreaming, or here he's hallucinating.

12:15.422 --> 12:16.864
And it turns out that these...

12:17.249 --> 12:31.928
have to do with some of his trigonometric proofs, where Copernicus neglects the fact that there's ambiguity in certain trigonometric solutions of triangles.

12:31.988 --> 12:33.009
Let me show you what I mean.

12:33.750 --> 12:44.944
If you have a side and an angle and an opposite side, there's a double solution, you see.

12:45.059 --> 12:47.582
if this is the opposite sign.

12:50.085 --> 13:02.301
So that's picked up from a commentator who says that about Copernicus, and a fair number of people copy that into their books.

13:02.982 --> 13:08.449
But you don't find the criticism with respect to the heliocentric cosmology.

13:13.735 --> 13:14.256
Sort of the

13:15.063 --> 13:23.716
The really interesting thing about the annotations is that major annotations very rarely come singly.

13:24.437 --> 13:35.213
That is to say, a major astronomer putting major annotations in his book is liable to have one or more students who copy those notes into their own books.

13:35.794 --> 13:42.083
So if you find some major annotations, you're likely to find them again in another book.

13:42.873 --> 13:53.467
And then another fascinating set of annotations are the corrections put in as a result of the Inquisition's instructions in 1620.

13:54.568 --> 14:04.661
And because they were very explicit about four places, sorry, a dozen places for censoring the book, if you look at a book, you could immediately say yes or no.

14:05.081 --> 14:07.044
Was this book censored or was it not?

14:07.524 --> 14:12.711
So I now have very good statistics on this, which the Inquisition never knew.

14:12.843 --> 14:18.470
They got something over 60 percent of the books in Italy, and essentially none outside.

14:19.812 --> 14:21.835
This is fascinating, isn't it?

14:21.915 --> 14:22.596
So, really.

14:22.636 --> 14:23.897
You probably saw that.

14:23.917 --> 14:29.304
I think there is the map in this book on the.

14:29.324 --> 14:31.427
That's quite a nice book, by the way.

14:33.250 --> 14:35.332
I just got a dandy review of it.

14:35.472 --> 14:41.220
There's people who are apparently still reviewing it, where somebody said, it's a great book.

14:41.240 --> 14:42.782
You don't have to read it in order.

14:43.319 --> 14:49.730
People have said that about my book, and I take that as a compliment.

14:51.573 --> 14:56.401
You say you've actually sought out and located 500 approximately?

14:56.442 --> 15:00.068
Here's the map you see on page 109, okay.

15:00.509 --> 15:07.741
Where you see the censored copies and the black dots, and there's a more updated version of that map.

15:07.761 --> 15:08.382
It'll be in my

15:08.665 --> 15:10.887
So this is a living book for you.

15:10.927 --> 15:21.496
I mean, this is actually a perfect example of a book that actually resonates truly from the time of its first appearance through the generations, doesn't it?

15:21.516 --> 15:28.602
There's actually a history not only of the text that was written, but each individual copy has been influential.

15:28.722 --> 15:30.604
I mean, is that a fair statement?

15:30.784 --> 15:32.185
Well, that's right.

15:32.285 --> 15:37.930
It's influential in actually looking physically at the book as opposed to seeing

15:38.095 --> 15:40.377
a copy of it and looking at the text.

15:41.038 --> 15:47.044
If these were all like peas in a pond, there's no reason to look at all of these copies.

15:47.064 --> 15:52.670
I mean, it would be, I think, very dull to start looking at copies of Darwin's Origin of Species.

15:53.051 --> 15:59.738
To begin with, it's in a trade binding, so they are all alike unless they've been rebound or something.

16:00.499 --> 16:06.465
And people aren't typically annotators anymore, the way they were

16:06.698 --> 16:09.041
in the 16th and 17th centuries.

16:09.602 --> 16:15.331
So I would not expect, excepting very rarely, to find interesting remarks in the margins.

16:15.932 --> 16:18.616
And with Darwin, you have, you know, a couple thousand.

16:19.117 --> 16:24.344
Well, by the time you go through all the editions, you've got tens of thousands of copies of the book.

16:25.446 --> 16:34.900
So trying to find the ones that are annotated by looking at all of them would be a foolhardy thing.

16:35.183 --> 16:40.909
You mentioned in here that only two or three books have undergone this kind of scrutiny.

16:41.169 --> 16:43.932
The First Folio of Shakespeare, the Lutenberg Bible.

16:44.392 --> 16:46.254
I suppose we could include the base psalm book.

16:46.334 --> 16:47.715
There are only 11 or so of them.

16:48.416 --> 16:50.158
And Copernicus.

16:50.238 --> 16:53.561
The Elephant Folio of John James Audubon is a wonderful book.

16:54.282 --> 16:57.865
Somebody is redoing the Shakespeare folios at the moment.

16:57.905 --> 17:00.308
I've had some correspondence with him.

17:01.208 --> 17:03.891
In terms of technique, I guess?

17:04.090 --> 17:10.419
Yeah, in part, swapping notes on what one can find or expect to find about provenances, for example.

17:10.439 --> 17:14.625
And do you think that there will be annotations in the folios?

17:15.486 --> 17:17.429
No, he's not finding much at all like that.

17:17.669 --> 17:19.331
Do you have an explanation for that?

17:19.431 --> 17:26.021
Well, it's basically not the kind of thing you, it's not a technical work that you would want to write clarifying comments in the margins.

17:26.662 --> 17:31.228
Also, I think the destruction of the Shakespeare folios has been considerably greater.

17:31.799 --> 17:34.824
You estimate that actually half of the Copernicus .

17:36.065 --> 17:36.085
.

17:36.105 --> 17:36.125
.

17:36.146 --> 17:39.290
It was appreciated as an important book early on.

17:39.330 --> 17:47.763
It's very interesting, something I found rather recently, and it's coming out in, I believe, the next issue of the Harvard Library Bulletin.

17:47.903 --> 17:59.781
It's an issue that you will find interesting, because the editors have asked quite a number of people to write very short essays on Widener Library as I

18:00.132 --> 18:05.438
a seat for detective solutions.

18:05.558 --> 18:11.504
In other words, using the library to solve particular problems.

18:12.285 --> 18:15.168
I'm a member of the Friends, and I think they send that to the library.

18:15.348 --> 18:16.750
They should, yeah.

18:16.770 --> 18:30.004
So, I've mentioned some of this research, and I mentioned finding something like seven or eight major libraries in the 16th century in England.

18:30.288 --> 18:42.902
Out of those, you get something like six copies of Copernicus, which shows that anybody who's building a major library is quite apt to have this book.

18:42.922 --> 18:50.710
The one where it doesn't occur is one that is strictly a legal library, so it wouldn't have been a target book for him.

18:50.730 --> 18:59.940
But otherwise, it seems to be, you know, already by the late

19:00.308 --> 19:10.722
1500s, it's seen as a classic book, and people aren't going to throw it away, because it was an expensive book, and it was sufficiently technical, it doesn't get worn out.

19:11.383 --> 19:14.467
So, tell me, how did you go about locating these books?

19:14.487 --> 19:15.889
Did you take out ads?

19:16.109 --> 19:19.193
Actually, almost so.

19:20.235 --> 19:27.244
I have put little notes in the bibliophile journals, so that dealers or

19:27.578 --> 19:31.323
collectors could see I was doing it and to get in touch with me.

19:32.505 --> 19:40.116
But you have to do it, first of all, by using the sort of standard bibliographic tools.

19:41.157 --> 19:51.232
Then you look at the nature of libraries in the world of learning, for example, when the library was founded and how many early books they have.

19:51.733 --> 19:56.860
And on this basis, you write a lot of letters to libraries asking if they've got it.

19:58.325 --> 20:00.828
You slip up on things.

20:01.590 --> 20:12.404
A few years ago, somebody said, you know, you ought to inquire in Solitern in Switzerland, because that's the kind of library that should have this.

20:12.424 --> 20:14.467
And I said, well, I don't have a copy listed there.

20:14.507 --> 20:15.389
I'll write them a letter.

20:16.110 --> 20:18.853
I wrote them a letter, and they said, sorry, we don't have the book.

20:19.214 --> 20:23.259
But six months later, the librarian wrote and said, guess what?

20:23.720 --> 20:27.285
We've found the book in the uncatalogued portion of our library.

20:28.008 --> 20:29.309
Isn't that amazing?

20:29.329 --> 20:31.212
I was so pleased that he remembered.

20:31.572 --> 20:42.244
And then it turned out that it had a sufficiently interesting note in it at the beginning that we spent some effort trying to decipher the handwriting and transcribe it for the census.

20:42.264 --> 20:44.687
And so are you planning to publish this census?

20:45.067 --> 20:47.510
I'll show you some pages in just a moment.

20:48.812 --> 20:49.733
All right.

20:50.153 --> 20:55.399
But the chasing around to find the books has been quite tricky.

20:55.835 --> 21:11.873
There's the Adams catalog of sixteenth-century books in Cambridge University libraries, but I had to be there for a number of months before I discovered that Trinity College had a copy that wasn't on the Adams list.

21:13.174 --> 21:17.499
I'll talk about that copy in the Groyer Club lecture, probably.

21:18.500 --> 21:21.403
Are you confident that you found most of the

21:21.873 --> 21:24.497
Well, not all of them.

21:24.817 --> 21:27.441
I wonder how many are out there that I haven't found.

21:28.182 --> 21:34.071
I would like to think that it's fewer than 20 copies of the first edition, but I just don't know.

21:34.532 --> 21:47.110
I recently, somebody had told me some time ago that he thought there was a copy in Manila, and I thought, well, yeah, it's likely the Jesuits would have taken it in, so I wrote to the Jesuit University, and they said, nothing doing.

21:47.952 --> 21:50.175
And then, just a couple years ago,

21:51.050 --> 21:53.133
And the information got more specific.

21:53.934 --> 21:56.057
It was at a Dominican university.

21:56.078 --> 21:56.799
So you did find it.

21:56.879 --> 22:03.008
And I have, even a former student has gone in and taken a photograph of it, so it's physically there.

22:04.190 --> 22:05.992
And how about locating private owners?

22:06.012 --> 22:07.154
That must be a lot trickier.

22:08.396 --> 22:17.209
Private owners is a lot trickier, and for this, I am practically dependent upon dealers, to tell me, who

22:17.560 --> 22:20.883
they know of who's a private collector who would be apt to have it.

22:22.505 --> 22:24.606
There tends to be a little bit of secrecy.

22:25.467 --> 22:36.477
If a person is an active client of a dealer, a dealer is very hesitant to mention this because they don't want other dealers poaching.

22:37.018 --> 22:43.924
But the irony of this, again, is that it always seems that the other dealers know who this person is, and they're always glad to tell me.

22:44.905 --> 22:47.247
So there isn't too much

22:47.530 --> 22:50.815
keeping of secrets in this business.

22:51.235 --> 22:56.983
Now, the garden copy, which you maintain, is really probably the most important in private hands.

22:57.023 --> 22:58.685
Where did that go, just out of curiosity?

22:58.706 --> 23:00.568
Where did that go from the garden?

23:00.688 --> 23:10.602
That has gone to Vicenza in Italy, and I am on my way over to have another look at it.

23:10.818 --> 23:14.502
So it really only changed hands once since leaving the garden?

23:14.622 --> 23:15.263
That's right.

23:15.604 --> 23:17.466
And this is a private collection?

23:17.526 --> 23:19.448
Yeah, quite a fabulous private collection.

23:19.468 --> 23:22.432
He has, in fact, made a catalog of his collection.

23:22.472 --> 23:23.693
It's sitting here on the shelf.

23:24.714 --> 23:28.719
Is this somebody I might like to interview when I go to Italy, do you think?

23:29.139 --> 23:30.521
You might very well want to.

23:31.042 --> 23:31.903
Could I have a copy?

23:31.943 --> 23:34.826
Would you imagine by having a copy of this?

23:35.667 --> 23:40.032
I could give you a copy of that, or I could...

23:40.400 --> 23:43.465
give you a copy of the front page of his catalog.

23:43.505 --> 23:47.331
That would be even better, which is here.

23:48.313 --> 23:51.378
Well, as you can see, it's just a wonderful Xerox edition.

23:51.739 --> 23:53.882
Oh, yeah.

23:54.002 --> 23:54.904
Isn't that nice?

23:54.924 --> 23:57.468
He did it rather beautifully.

23:58.951 --> 23:59.792
His name is

24:00.633 --> 24:03.618
If I could have a copy of that.

24:03.758 --> 24:09.207
I think this or the letter will enable me to get in touch with them, too.

24:09.868 --> 24:11.069
I think I better give you the letter.

24:11.350 --> 24:14.094
If you don't mind, and you can count on my discretion.

24:14.214 --> 24:25.392
Yeah, well, I mean, it's better for you to wait, in a way, until after I've been over there to see him, so I get a better sense of how...

24:25.608 --> 24:31.515
I really want to get some European collectors in this next book.

24:32.076 --> 24:33.698
Otto Schaeffer.

24:33.918 --> 24:34.519
Otto Schaeffer.

24:34.599 --> 24:35.640
Is he selling this collection?

24:35.660 --> 24:36.902
He is, but it doesn't matter.

24:36.922 --> 24:37.443
I'd still like it.

24:37.463 --> 24:40.827
Another one is Henri Scheler.

24:41.227 --> 24:42.329
Have you met him?

24:42.549 --> 24:42.829
No.

24:42.990 --> 24:46.314
I'm really going to try and get some of the really notable references.

24:46.334 --> 24:49.017
I am going to Italy to see Umberto Eco.

24:49.587 --> 24:50.628
Okay.

24:50.748 --> 24:51.910
Well, when are you going to Italy?

24:52.030 --> 24:54.013
I haven't planned it yet, but it'll be several months.

24:54.033 --> 24:57.337
We'll wait until I'm back, and then I can tell you a little bit better.

24:57.377 --> 25:01.742
Just so I can put him on my itinerary, projected itinerary.

25:01.763 --> 25:02.103
That'd be great.

25:02.123 --> 25:02.303
Right.

25:02.423 --> 25:11.935
You see, in Europe, because of tax reasons and so on, some people try to be a little bit more secretive about what they're doing.

25:12.336 --> 25:19.265
There's somebody you might want to check in Japan, should you ever get that far.

25:19.285 --> 25:19.425
I hope.

25:19.844 --> 25:25.170
His name, well, is Reverend Kumoy or something like that.

25:25.230 --> 25:27.974
Is he the fellow that got the Lincoln stuff and the Shakespeare folios?

25:29.436 --> 25:29.996
I don't know.

25:30.016 --> 25:31.738
Did he form a university?

25:32.860 --> 25:33.080
No.

25:33.220 --> 25:37.405
He has a, he's putting them at a Buddhist monastery.

25:37.625 --> 25:39.107
Reverend, what's his name once more?

25:39.127 --> 25:42.051
I think it's K-U-M-O-I or something like that.

25:42.711 --> 25:42.852
Uh-huh.

25:42.872 --> 25:43.913
He has a Copernicus.

25:45.775 --> 25:49.800
And I just asked about a, asked Jonathan Hill about, uh,

25:50.236 --> 25:54.161
the catalog of Arago, of his library.

25:54.241 --> 25:56.304
He's a Frenchman from last century.

25:56.464 --> 25:57.946
I asked him if he still had it.

25:59.708 --> 26:01.531
Was Copernicus listed in it?

26:01.551 --> 26:07.739
He says it's, you know, in Kyoto, with Reverend Kumoy, I'll fax him.

26:07.759 --> 26:10.162
So, he's busy buying.

26:10.202 --> 26:12.345
Fascinating.

26:13.346 --> 26:18.032
So, this is a book you've seen several times before, and yet you're going to see it again.

26:18.383 --> 26:21.127
Oh, I'm going to see it because of the entire collection.

26:21.167 --> 26:23.950
I'm not basically going to see the Copernicus book.

26:23.970 --> 26:26.173
And this, of course, is a bibliophile in you.

26:27.455 --> 26:35.946
Well, I've been chasing another book as well, which is the Appianus Astronomicum Caesareum, and he's got a copy of that, which I haven't seen.

26:35.966 --> 26:37.087
Now, tell me a bit about that.

26:37.128 --> 26:41.213
I've seen a hundred, over a hundred copies of that one.

26:41.233 --> 26:45.739
Well, you see that picture on the wall?

26:45.819 --> 26:46.640
That's not a picture.

26:46.680 --> 26:48.222
That's an actual page.

26:48.590 --> 26:52.515
of a book that has got layered parts on it.

26:52.535 --> 27:04.891
There are about ten layers of paper there because it's a moving device, and this was the great tour de force of printing in the 16th century.

27:05.612 --> 27:07.434
And who is the author of this?

27:07.454 --> 27:09.357
His name is Apianus.

27:09.377 --> 27:10.518
And we spell that?

27:10.538 --> 27:12.541
A-P-I-A-N-U-S.

27:13.922 --> 27:17.567
Well, 25 years ago,

27:17.986 --> 27:26.394
Addition Leipzig in then East Germany put out a fantastic facsimile of this book.

27:26.414 --> 27:28.976
You can see it's large, a full cap of lining.

27:29.056 --> 27:30.658
Is that a facsimile?

27:30.798 --> 27:31.839
That's the real thing.

27:32.239 --> 27:35.622
Son of a gun.

27:35.742 --> 27:37.924
The book is full of those kinds of things.

27:38.845 --> 27:47.453
What happened was I was helping a dealer who had two defective copies that he was merging to try to get one good one.

27:47.905 --> 27:50.248
And he had doubles on this particular page.

27:50.268 --> 28:04.748
So a book was not really... And so he asked, you know, I said, you know, I'd really like your duplicate of this one, because he had only enough pages, really, to make one, almost to make one good book.

28:05.169 --> 28:10.116
So I have one of the very few single pages in captivity of that book.

28:10.176 --> 28:12.840
Were there, and when was this book published?

28:12.860 --> 28:13.360
1540.

28:13.581 --> 28:14.622
Oh, wow.

28:15.783 --> 28:22.413
And all of that coloring was done in the shop in Ingolstadt, in his private press.

28:22.674 --> 28:26.119
Most books at that time were, of course, hand-colored by the owner.

28:26.560 --> 28:32.509
This was one of those rare editions where if you bought this book, you got a colored one.

28:32.529 --> 28:34.232
Is the Copernicus illustrated at all?

28:34.252 --> 28:36.375
Were there any illustrations in there?

28:36.555 --> 28:38.378
Oh, lots of technical diagrams.

28:38.559 --> 28:43.626
We would touch probably every summer.

28:43.667 --> 28:43.967
Yeah.

28:44.251 --> 28:58.065
This is one that has an interesting history.

28:58.125 --> 29:03.530
It's been cut up by somebody who is busy making good books out of bad ones.

29:06.413 --> 29:11.558
So it's, in fact, not even quite in order here.

29:13.225 --> 29:21.935
Here's the famous page with the heliocentric diagram on it.

29:24.819 --> 29:25.239
Wow.

29:26.721 --> 29:30.585
Isn't that, but it hasn't really fucked that badly either, has it?

29:30.605 --> 29:34.049
No, it's a, uh, it's an incomplete copy.

29:34.069 --> 29:39.255
As I say, I own, uh, 1.9 copies of this book.

29:40.076 --> 29:42.439
I have a complete one, but I have, uh,

29:43.128 --> 29:47.012
I don't have a first edition, which is now about $150,000.

29:47.212 --> 29:52.257
I saw Jack Pincus's copy out in L.A.

29:52.277 --> 29:53.678
a couple years ago.

29:53.939 --> 29:54.319
Okay.

29:54.379 --> 29:55.220
Yeah, the nice one.

29:55.240 --> 30:01.866
And, of course, Haskell Norman considered that's a great feeling of his collection, that he was unable to get a Copernicus.

30:01.886 --> 30:04.849
Well, as you know, there's one listed in his catalog.

30:04.869 --> 30:07.692
Well, that was the one that was stolen.

30:07.712 --> 30:11.616
Yeah, that stolen copy was here in my office for about six weeks.

30:11.900 --> 30:17.507
I was part of that story of finding out what was going on.

30:20.450 --> 30:25.777
I don't know how much you want to impress me about the Copernican census and when you want to actually start looking at some books.

30:25.837 --> 30:26.378
Okay.

30:26.778 --> 30:30.322
How about just, we've got about a half an hour before you have to go back again.

30:31.043 --> 30:35.649
I do want to actually impress you a little bit more.

30:36.049 --> 30:40.675
So you started a new census on this book, and you hope to find out similar things from this book?

30:40.958 --> 30:50.826
No, I only call the other one a survey rather than a census, because I haven't copied down provenances and all the rest.

30:51.407 --> 31:08.221
But what happened was when Addition Leipzig made this facsimile, it was a tour de force of color printing, including the wrinkles, the stains, everything, excepting then they botched it up when it came time to assemble the moving parts.

31:09.662 --> 31:10.763
So this was just

31:11.384 --> 31:24.858
totally bungled, and I got interested in this facsimile, and then from the facsimile, got interested in seeing what their chances were of getting a bungled copy to reproduce.

31:25.519 --> 31:41.256
And it became clear pretty rapidly that all of the copies that left Appianus's workshop were just impeccably assembled, magnificently so, and that the only copies that were messed up

31:41.641 --> 31:50.270
were ones that had come apart because of dampness, and then pages got shuffled and so on.

31:50.970 --> 32:01.701
I got into the Basel University Library on a Saturday afternoon, when there were no librarians around, and found their copy was all messed up.

32:02.121 --> 32:10.990
So, I carefully reconstructed it for them, with a little trepidation, because you can never be sure

32:11.138 --> 32:14.762
how librarians are going to feel about this kind of thing.

32:14.782 --> 32:18.786
But in that particular case, they seemed to be very grateful that I had done it.

32:20.168 --> 32:28.297
The British Museum copy, they were, was restored at the beginning of this century, dreadfully mixed up.

32:28.777 --> 32:35.104
They were not about to let me move the pieces, but they took me down to the conservation

32:35.354 --> 32:41.681
And I didn't touch them, but I pointed to them piece after piece, telling the conservators where they had to put them.

32:42.142 --> 32:49.090
And so I essentially reconstructed the British Library copy without actually touching it.

32:49.110 --> 32:49.550
Wow.

32:49.570 --> 33:04.467
Would you say this became an obsession of yours, or would you say that you saw this as part of your professional mandate, or was this a hobby, or is this something you did to move yourself?

33:04.818 --> 33:09.503
You almost have to say it's a professional hobby if there's anything like that.

33:11.084 --> 33:26.459
So I have gone to considerable effort to see every possible copy that I can when I find out where one is, but it's not such an obsession that after an auction I knock myself out to find out where it has gone and so on.

33:26.479 --> 33:32.125
So I know a number of copies that have passed through the auction market where I haven't a clue where they've gone.

33:33.252 --> 33:35.895
Of course, with the Copernicus, I've worked very hard on this.

33:36.676 --> 33:38.398
I had an interesting story one day.

33:39.879 --> 33:48.268
Most book dealers are pretty forthcoming about where copies are, but Hans Krauss was typically a very secretive man.

33:49.069 --> 33:55.696
So, finally, he agreed to tell me something about the copies he handled.

33:55.716 --> 34:01.943
So, I went down to New York, and he produced the card file of all of the

34:02.429 --> 34:07.074
Copernicus copies he had handled, but without any locations on them.

34:07.915 --> 34:12.481
So, I went through his entire stack of cards, and I told him where each one was.

34:12.541 --> 34:16.846
Then, when we were through, I said, where's the Prince of Lichtenstein copy?

34:16.866 --> 34:19.209
You've sold that one, too, and it isn't here.

34:20.570 --> 34:22.312
What did you say to him?

34:22.332 --> 34:24.495
Well, he was pretty much faked out.

34:24.855 --> 34:28.940
I think I melted him, because after that— Melted was the word?

34:28.960 --> 34:32.284
Melted, yes.

34:32.551 --> 34:37.015
uh, obviously had a grudging admiration to what I had achieved.

34:37.035 --> 34:37.856
That's a great story.

34:37.876 --> 34:39.518
So, did he know where, did he have an answer?

34:40.278 --> 34:41.379
They hadn't kept a record?

34:41.399 --> 34:42.060
He didn't know.

34:42.781 --> 34:42.921
Wow.

34:43.201 --> 34:44.442
It was a second edition.

34:44.462 --> 34:46.424
Well, have you found it since then?

34:46.444 --> 34:50.128
Most of the Prince of Liechtenstein materials have book plates in them.

34:50.188 --> 34:51.849
I've not found one with a book plate.

34:51.869 --> 34:53.651
So, that one's, you don't know?

34:53.671 --> 34:56.834
I suspect I may have seen it without knowing that it was.

34:57.034 --> 34:58.896
It could have been rebound or anything.

34:59.315 --> 35:04.240
Yeah, but you pretty much also determined provenance as many of the books as you could.

35:04.300 --> 35:08.024
That's right, and I don't have a Prince of Liechtenstein provenance on any copy.

35:09.226 --> 35:11.648
Let me tell you something that's happened more recently.

35:11.728 --> 35:13.650
That's a great little story.

35:14.231 --> 35:23.301
I had heard a rumor that Columbia University Library had sold one of their second editions as a duplicate.

35:23.321 --> 35:27.145
I heard some, you know, vague rumor that it had gone to Japan.

35:27.800 --> 35:32.467
the two leading Japanese dealers denied any knowledge of it.

35:32.487 --> 35:44.766
And so, I wrote to Columbia, and they, after some months, wrote back and said, oh, it had appeared in the Swan book auction sale at such and such a day.

35:45.808 --> 35:48.832
Well, I knew right away that I knew where that copy had gone.

35:49.233 --> 35:51.116
Well, why hadn't I recognized it?

35:51.777 --> 35:52.398
And you know what?

35:52.939 --> 35:54.381
In that process,

35:54.715 --> 36:12.020
That book had been rebound, and all the earlier provenances destroyed, which as soon as I knew that piece of information, I was delighted to discover that the two times I had measured the book came out exactly the same to the nearest millimeter.

36:12.881 --> 36:15.244
So, that was a check on your own procedure, wasn't it?

36:15.264 --> 36:16.666
That's right.

36:16.686 --> 36:24.317
And the rest of the things, like the red speckled edges, was not changed in the rebinding, so it was

36:24.871 --> 36:27.353
It was clear that, yes, indeed, this was the same one.

36:27.714 --> 36:31.638
That is, as far as I know, the nearest I've come to having a ghost in the same sense.

36:31.658 --> 36:43.909
Can you think of any other books that might warrant this kind of determined investigation, not necessarily books in your professional line of perspective?

36:44.010 --> 36:52.578
I suspect that it works better for technical books, and I think Kepler's Astronomia Nova would be another good candidate for this kind of work.

36:52.778 --> 36:54.760
Otherwise, it's a little hard to say.

36:55.128 --> 37:01.476
I don't think literary books are apt to draw the same kind of marginalia.

37:01.996 --> 37:10.646
And Ulysses, for instance, to cite one example, which certainly had great consequences, as publication did.

37:10.666 --> 37:17.214
I'm sure that nobody wrote into the margins of those books, because they recognized the value of it immediately when it came out.

37:18.636 --> 37:19.617
That would be my guess.

37:20.305 --> 37:22.267
That's my assumption.

37:22.408 --> 37:26.753
Somebody is trying to do a census about Ulysses, I think.

37:26.793 --> 37:33.241
Yeah, it'd be interesting perhaps to locate them, but I don't think looking in for marginalia is necessarily going to help.

37:33.261 --> 37:40.129
And so, to go back to the original premise, Kessler's mandate, was it, that this is a book that nobody read?

37:40.149 --> 37:42.752
That's totally, in your view, you've disproven that.

37:43.493 --> 37:49.941
It seems to me that it was recognized as very important early on, and

37:50.461 --> 37:54.686
If you stop to think about it, it's got to be wrong.

37:54.706 --> 37:57.429
There was a second edition and a third edition.

37:57.949 --> 37:59.591
So demand was there.

37:59.611 --> 38:05.037
If it's an all-time worst seller, you do not have a second edition and a third edition.

38:05.057 --> 38:07.340
So why would Tesla make such a bold statement like that?

38:07.360 --> 38:08.521
Probably he couldn't penetrate it.

38:08.561 --> 38:09.022
Who knows?

38:09.803 --> 38:10.243
That's right.

38:10.283 --> 38:16.350
Well, on this particular general area, he has preserved a certain amount of mythology.

38:17.005 --> 38:19.227
Okay, I know you're kind of scheduled.

38:19.247 --> 38:22.970
No, I'm still okay, but I must show you some pages of the census.

38:23.171 --> 38:25.152
Let me bring some.

38:25.172 --> 38:26.814
Okay.

38:26.834 --> 38:33.960
Here you can see the camera ready copy on its under way.

38:35.001 --> 38:47.012
This shows the physical state of the book, then the provenances, if there are any, and then

38:47.397 --> 38:52.705
any comments about what's going on in annotations in the book.

38:53.065 --> 38:53.846
Who will publish this?

38:53.906 --> 38:54.828
Harvard?

38:55.068 --> 39:03.761
It's, at the moment, we're expecting it to be published by Brill in Holland and Leiden.

39:03.781 --> 39:08.347
Okay, now you're looking at the, at a section of USA.

39:09.429 --> 39:13.014
So, there you, there it begins with... How did Arizona get one?

39:13.034 --> 39:14.957
That's interesting.

39:15.562 --> 39:19.507
They had some collectors living out there, the Barkas's.

39:19.527 --> 39:20.729
I think they're still alive.

39:23.793 --> 39:24.854
So you never know, do you?

39:24.874 --> 39:25.935
You even have the prices there.

39:26.416 --> 39:27.838
Oh, I have a lot of prices in.

39:28.839 --> 39:29.159
Wow.

39:29.600 --> 39:30.401
Where possible.

39:31.723 --> 39:32.664
Going way, way back.

39:32.884 --> 39:34.106
Here's the bankrupt's copy.

39:36.749 --> 39:37.951
Here's the pinkest copy.

39:38.471 --> 39:40.734
Look at all the information you have on that.

39:41.335 --> 39:44.539
Yes, that's because there's a lot of material in it.

39:44.857 --> 39:46.239
Now, for instance, let me just read aloud.

39:46.599 --> 39:54.588
On the last flyleaf is a Greek inscription with a Latin paraphrase, apparently not from a classical source, followed by six Latin lines as follows.

39:54.608 --> 39:56.090
And there's a long Latin inscription.

39:58.312 --> 40:12.889
Heavily glossed to the very end, possibly by Bishop I, the notes derive from a close and studious reading of the text, although in general not particularly critical, they rise above the more usual brief index notes.

40:13.342 --> 40:17.189
Longer notes are found on FF.

40:17.670 --> 40:21.597
The star catalog contains numerous corrections, both to the positions and to the terminology.

40:21.777 --> 40:26.265
So you've actually subjected every volume to this kind of scrutiny, is that correct?

40:26.286 --> 40:30.914
Yes, if they've got notes in them.

40:31.014 --> 40:33.839
So Jack Pincus is a pretty interesting book, isn't it?

40:33.859 --> 40:34.901
It has a star on it.

40:35.162 --> 40:35.923
A star, ah.

40:36.173 --> 40:37.995
This is a Michelin-type system.

40:38.075 --> 40:39.336
It goes up to three sides.

40:39.416 --> 40:39.636
I see.

40:39.736 --> 40:56.171
Dark Spanish goatskin double-blind scored rectangles around the sides in fluorons at the corners, and in the center of both sides, a large cartouche with the motto, R-E-L-I-C-T-U-R-O, next word, S-A-T-I-S, claps missing.

40:56.611 --> 41:02.356
And this is from Irwin J. Pincus, which I also handled this book, I'm pleased to say.

41:02.436 --> 41:04.358
Okay, so you get quite a bit about that.

41:04.642 --> 41:10.409
But then you get this one, and it's only a couple of trivia notes.

41:10.429 --> 41:11.731
No stars on this one.

41:11.751 --> 41:12.091
No.

41:13.092 --> 41:22.824
Then the next one will be another one in Los Altos by another one of the Silicon Valley people, a first edition.

41:23.585 --> 41:26.489
That one I haven't inserted in there yet.

41:26.509 --> 41:29.232
I see.

41:31.287 --> 41:32.569
So none of these have stars.

41:32.729 --> 41:34.911
So actually you go up to three stars.

41:35.092 --> 41:40.478
A three-star copy obviously would be the former garden copy, the one you're going to go see again in Italy.

41:40.678 --> 41:41.840
That would have to be three.

41:42.040 --> 41:42.561
That's one.

41:42.821 --> 41:49.509
Yes, there are about roughly ten three-star copies.

41:49.529 --> 41:55.076
And to qualify as a three-star copy, you really have to have something?

41:55.096 --> 41:58.780
You have to have interesting and in general identified

41:59.114 --> 42:01.578
notes from a major figure.

42:01.938 --> 42:03.421
And a two-star would be?

42:04.282 --> 42:16.441
A two-star will have a fair number of technical comments in, and probably from a known person.

42:16.461 --> 42:17.502
And then the one-star?

42:17.522 --> 42:27.197
One-star means that there's something about at least one annotation in that's very interesting, whether it's been censored or something like that.

42:27.987 --> 42:34.556
If there's no stars, it means basically it's just sort of a humdrum copy that has only trivial notes.

42:34.736 --> 42:37.760
And you're documenting its existence of basically what you're doing.

42:37.780 --> 42:38.401
That's right.

42:38.421 --> 42:50.517
So you're going to have, with this, you'll have a text, an area of text to... There will be a discussion at the beginning that I suppose I had better indicate on what basis I've awarded the stars.

42:51.118 --> 42:54.923
It hadn't occurred to me, but that's a good idea.

42:55.780 --> 42:57.041
You mean for this?

42:57.582 --> 42:57.862
Yeah.

42:57.882 --> 42:58.703
Yeah, I think you should.

42:59.424 --> 43:03.748
Now, there will be a general essay at the beginning that tells what kind of things have been found here.

43:03.768 --> 43:04.629
Oh, sure, absolutely.

43:04.689 --> 43:06.110
Now, here's a three-star copy.

43:06.130 --> 43:07.652
Wow, this is Yale's copy.

43:07.672 --> 43:10.175
Yeah, this is the only three-star copy in America.

43:11.696 --> 43:14.679
And look at all the material.

43:14.739 --> 43:22.547
Now, why don't you explain for me why this was a three-star copy instead of my reading, just because of all these

43:22.983 --> 43:24.745
annotations and things here.

43:24.785 --> 43:35.175
Because it was a copy that has been annotated both by Johannes Homelius and Johannes Pretorius, two important figures.

43:36.896 --> 43:42.462
The Homelius is not Homelius' writing, but they're copying his annotations into the book.

43:42.682 --> 43:49.108
And that's H-O-M-E-L-I-U-S, 1518-1562, Johannes, J-O-H-A-N-N-E-S.

43:50.810 --> 43:53.534
Yeah, and then Johannes Praetorius.

43:54.315 --> 43:56.999
P-R-A-E-T-O-R-I-U-S.

43:58.041 --> 44:00.445
And so Praetorius had it after.

44:01.386 --> 44:01.787
That's right.

44:01.807 --> 44:03.810
So it passed from his hands to his hands.

44:03.830 --> 44:08.377
So actually, look at the... This is... Oh, this is... Would I be able to get a Xerox of this page?

44:08.817 --> 44:15.287
Because this really shows the owners through the generations, doesn't it?

44:15.467 --> 44:16.168
Very interesting.

44:16.228 --> 44:18.572
The people of this particular copy influenced.

44:19.075 --> 44:27.666
I can probably give you a Xerox of a different copy, which will have an even richer series of provenance.

44:27.686 --> 44:30.269
This is an example that I could draw from in the text here.

44:32.913 --> 44:38.400
You can see now the write-up of this copy goes for five pages.

44:38.520 --> 44:48.593
So you were excited when you... Oh, I was very excited when I realized that this was the long-lost copy that had been mentioned in the literature.

44:48.792 --> 44:50.854
This is the Yale copy.

44:50.894 --> 44:59.063
Yeah, but without identifying where it was, because we had this description of the copy from 1625.

44:59.163 --> 45:01.125
Well, did Yale know what they had?

45:01.445 --> 45:03.547
Of course not.

45:03.567 --> 45:04.468
How would they?

45:05.269 --> 45:07.011
So, what they knew was they had a Copernicus.

45:07.391 --> 45:07.812
That's right.

45:08.813 --> 45:12.376
And it took Owen Gingrich to come in and say, do you have any idea what you have here?

45:13.077 --> 45:13.798
Something like that.

45:13.878 --> 45:14.339
That's right.

45:14.959 --> 45:15.500
I love that.

45:16.621 --> 45:17.702
That's wonderful.

45:18.205 --> 45:19.507
I'd love to have a copy of that.

45:19.888 --> 45:21.210
Well, okay, we'll make a copy of it.

45:21.230 --> 45:21.871
If you don't mind.

45:22.191 --> 45:22.912
No problem.

45:22.992 --> 45:25.196
And anything I do, I'm going to run by you, okay?

45:25.256 --> 45:26.638
We're still several years away.

45:28.481 --> 45:31.566
But we'll go over some of this stuff.

45:31.626 --> 45:33.789
I think it only protects me to have it right.

45:34.230 --> 45:38.457
Not protects, but I think when we're dealing with... It makes a lot of sense.

45:38.477 --> 45:44.766
When we're dealing with very specific stuff like this, it behooves me to run it by you.

45:44.807 --> 45:45.107
So...

45:45.847 --> 45:52.955
Well, anyway, I don't think it helps to go through much more because you get the flavor of it.

45:52.975 --> 45:55.998
And that has no stars at all, the OOC copy.

45:56.058 --> 45:58.281
This one I should probably give a star to.

45:58.301 --> 46:06.430
A lot of people would suppose that Day 2's copy would be worth something, but there are no annotations in it.

46:06.450 --> 46:13.558
That's D-E capital T-H-O-M-U, and Day 2 is one of the famous collectors who

46:13.775 --> 46:16.898
has very wonderful bookbinding.

46:16.918 --> 46:24.106
That's Jacques Auguste II, 1533-1717, French historian and fastidious book collector.

46:24.126 --> 46:27.450
This library passed through several owners before being auctioned in 1789.

46:28.852 --> 46:29.613
This is wonderful.

46:30.113 --> 46:30.954
This is really wonderful.

46:31.014 --> 46:32.696
You can't tell me you're not having fun with this.

46:32.956 --> 46:34.838
Now, you've just indicated you're going to give it a star?

46:35.479 --> 46:41.225
No, I just noticed that it's inconsistent here in the capitalization.

46:42.467 --> 46:43.528
I see.

46:44.116 --> 46:46.700
And that's the one that was purloined, right?

46:46.720 --> 46:47.841
Is that the Crearine copy?

46:47.861 --> 46:47.921
No.

46:47.941 --> 46:49.864
No, that's the University of Chicago copy.

46:50.245 --> 46:51.987
This is the purloined copy.

46:53.449 --> 46:56.133
And you can see.

46:56.153 --> 47:01.901
There are quite a few copies in Chicago, aren't there?

47:03.303 --> 47:04.144
Stone.

47:04.164 --> 47:05.426
Book plates removed.

47:06.467 --> 47:09.111
So it reports, um,

47:10.357 --> 47:23.713
and that was consigned to Howell and illustrated in catalog 53, item 41, 1981, $60,000, sold to Dr. Haskell Norman, San Francisco collector, but returned when the Chicago theft was discovered.

47:23.953 --> 47:27.097
Now, this number, that's designation, that's 1566, 1565.

47:27.117 --> 47:36.228
1566 means it's a second edition, and 1543 means it's a first edition.

47:36.588 --> 47:39.992
Now, the reason for mixing both the first and second editions

47:40.293 --> 47:59.236
in the same run, as that so often when you have a first edition and a second edition in the same library, a lot of the book stamps and so on are exactly the same, and there's no reason to describe them the second time in such detail.

48:01.058 --> 48:04.062
So that usually, often, the copies are related.

48:04.302 --> 48:09.068
This is particularly true when you have old

48:09.622 --> 48:11.705
No annotations you're pointing at?

48:11.845 --> 48:12.126
No.

48:12.666 --> 48:15.691
Oh, since 1977, this copy has been missing.

48:16.472 --> 48:16.652
Yep.

48:16.672 --> 48:17.673
Stolen, you assume?

48:18.014 --> 48:18.755
Presumably.

48:18.795 --> 48:19.456
Presumably.

48:19.516 --> 48:23.381
And this one was at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

48:24.022 --> 48:24.162
Mm-hmm.

48:26.045 --> 48:26.345
Great.

48:26.446 --> 48:30.792
They had it on some sort of relatively informal exhibition, not in a case.

48:31.713 --> 48:39.544
And when the day was over, somehow, by and by, they realized they didn't have as many books as they had started out with.

48:40.351 --> 48:40.992
It's sad, isn't it?

48:41.012 --> 48:49.920
It's really... Whoever stole it has it for his own personal use because it hasn't appeared in the market.

48:52.662 --> 48:54.083
That's fascinating.

48:55.224 --> 48:57.246
It really is.

48:57.266 --> 48:57.887
Very rich.

49:00.569 --> 49:02.451
To get back on, yeah, that would be wonderful.

49:03.892 --> 49:09.497
What I think, Doctor, is... Let me transcribe this.

49:09.663 --> 49:12.808
I'll be in touch and we'll get together again.

49:13.088 --> 49:23.743
That sounds good to me.

49:25.526 --> 49:38.725
The reason I have a safe is that I was being eaten up by insurance costs, and I finally discovered that if I would buy a safe and not insure them,

49:38.924 --> 49:40.205
Don't put that in your mouth.

49:40.225 --> 49:41.887
I'm not.

49:42.007 --> 49:45.090
It would save me a lot of money, and I could buy more books.

49:45.431 --> 49:50.075
The safe pays for itself in a few months.

49:50.095 --> 50:01.727
You know, because this is a rifle safe, but they also sell it with shells.

50:02.708 --> 50:04.830
Let me pick out a...

50:05.468 --> 50:09.013
This is now what we're looking at are items from your personal collection.

50:09.053 --> 50:09.614
That's right.

50:10.795 --> 50:16.062
This is a John of Glogal commentary on the sphere of Sacrobasto.

50:16.082 --> 50:22.371
John of Glogal was probably one of Copernicus's teachers at Krakow.

50:22.391 --> 50:35.188
So it has a very nice wood block there, a very charming wood block here of the earth and the various spheres of water, air, and fire, and planets, and their heaven all around.

50:35.540 --> 50:37.802
When I saw this book, I was charmed by those.

50:38.303 --> 50:43.388
I specialize in Sacrovasca, which is what he's coming on.

50:43.408 --> 50:46.291
But when I hit this page, I knew I had to have this book.

50:46.832 --> 50:48.013
Now, you hold that.

50:48.153 --> 50:48.653
Okay.

50:51.657 --> 50:53.939
These are hand drawings here, right?

50:53.959 --> 50:55.861
Mm-hmm.

50:55.881 --> 50:56.882
Sacrovasca.

50:56.962 --> 51:03.268
Now, that is, let's see, that's, if you translate it, it turns out to be John of Hollywood.

51:04.330 --> 51:04.770
Okay.

51:05.189 --> 51:07.111
Now, here's another Sacre Vasco.

51:07.131 --> 51:09.134
This is in a 1499 edition.

51:09.554 --> 51:09.995
Wow.

51:10.456 --> 51:20.168
So this is an inkunable, and it's rather pretty because it has all these hand-colored illustrations from way back then.

51:20.208 --> 51:23.392
It's hard to believe that that's quite when we did it over, isn't it?

51:23.412 --> 51:24.012
Just about.

51:24.173 --> 51:24.473
Yeah.

51:24.853 --> 51:29.840
It goes over in a few years.

51:29.860 --> 51:30.741
That's magnificent.

51:30.761 --> 51:31.982
Look at all the annotations.

51:32.763 --> 51:34.285
And notice, this is the

51:34.535 --> 51:37.418
Sacrobasto text, and this is the commentary.

51:37.799 --> 51:44.206
It's set up like a medieval manuscript.

51:44.226 --> 51:51.795
Just hang on.

51:52.396 --> 52:02.248
What we're looking at is that this individual, the book I'm holding, copied these illustrations directly out of this printed text here and did a very good job of it, actually.

52:02.268 --> 52:04.390
The only thing he lost was the flag.

52:04.994 --> 52:09.702
But otherwise, look, the little details of the ship, everything is all there.

52:09.782 --> 52:11.845
Now, did you recognize this immediately?

52:11.886 --> 52:13.408
I recognized it immediately.

52:13.789 --> 52:15.692
You did, because you knew this text so well.

52:15.872 --> 52:16.153
Yeah.

52:16.293 --> 52:17.735
And the title of this text once again?

52:17.755 --> 52:20.280
They're both sakravaskas.

52:20.320 --> 52:24.988
But the owner of this tried to put in, I wonder why he chose those two illustrations?

52:25.008 --> 52:26.751
Well, now turn over to the previous page.

52:31.118 --> 52:31.238
Wow.

52:32.635 --> 52:33.436
That's amazing.

52:33.456 --> 52:35.097
And they're very good, aren't they?

52:35.117 --> 52:36.358
They're very capably done.

52:36.819 --> 52:41.223
Now, the fact is, this one is rotating compared to here.

52:41.643 --> 52:46.468
So I'm sure these guys have these same wood blocks all down in Venice.

52:46.508 --> 52:48.410
They were putting them in edition after edition.

52:48.470 --> 52:57.338
So actually, then, he hasn't copied it from this edition, but probably from another edition that has that wood block 90 degrees around.

52:58.699 --> 53:01.101
And especially where he's so good, you can see it.

53:01.121 --> 53:01.782
I mean, you can see that.

53:02.403 --> 53:03.665
Yeah, exactly.

53:04.245 --> 53:05.587
Old bits there.

53:05.887 --> 53:06.809
Wonderful.

53:06.829 --> 53:08.651
Well, look, he did this in many places, didn't he?

53:08.671 --> 53:08.811
Mm-hmm.

53:09.232 --> 53:12.396
So anyway, that was why I had to have that.

53:12.516 --> 53:14.438
And do we know who the owner was of this?

53:14.539 --> 53:15.460
No, we don't.

53:15.500 --> 53:20.106
This is G-O-O-G-O-D-I-E-N-S Sacro.

53:20.606 --> 53:22.068
That's for Sacro Vasco.

53:22.108 --> 53:24.732
Okay, and this is Sacro Vasco.

53:24.912 --> 53:28.056
Just so when I come to spell this and transcribe it, I'm not going to go crazy.

53:28.542 --> 53:30.083
Oh, that's wonderful.

53:30.564 --> 53:39.933
In any event, we don't know who annotated it, but I agreed that if it was Copernicus's hand, I would get back in touch with the dealer.

53:41.114 --> 53:44.738
Well, as you point out, there were very few things extant in Copernicus's hand.

53:45.138 --> 53:45.899
That's right.

53:46.860 --> 53:51.364
And what's very interesting is that he is such a mystery, almost like Shakespeare in that regard.

53:51.384 --> 53:52.025
There's so little .

53:54.467 --> 53:57.570
You can do better than with Shakespeare in some ways.

53:57.854 --> 54:04.901
because there are so many books still extant from his library, all in Uppsala, where they were taken in the Thirty Years' War.

54:05.782 --> 54:08.845
And so it's kind of fun to go up there.

54:08.865 --> 54:12.588
So there is a window into his soul, to a degree, isn't there, with his books?

54:12.608 --> 54:16.092
I felt, after looking at those books, that this was great.

54:16.152 --> 54:21.637
It was not just a cardboard figure, but a real flesh-and-blood guy who owned the books.

54:21.697 --> 54:23.219
And so you went to see his library?

54:23.879 --> 54:24.200
I did.

54:24.400 --> 54:27.743
And that is where it was in Uppsala in Sweden, and the first time I did it,

54:27.976 --> 54:39.250
They didn't have these books separated out, so I had to spend a whole morning writing call slips, just have them fetched from all the different divisions where they were classified.

54:39.310 --> 54:41.693
Have they put them back together again, I hope?

54:41.933 --> 54:42.694
Now they have, yes.

54:42.714 --> 54:45.318
It's a lot easier to see the whole works.

54:45.338 --> 54:55.350
But it was wonderful to get them all fetched and put them in a line there in the sort of broken sunlight coming in through the windows and get a

54:55.499 --> 55:00.744
Have you thought of writing a biographical essay of Copernicus?

55:00.784 --> 55:04.267
I'm going to write a biography of Copernicus.

55:04.407 --> 55:06.749
I am on the schedule for that.

55:06.949 --> 55:09.932
I anticipated that because it seems like you're on track to do that.

55:10.632 --> 55:21.042
Now, I said that on that Reinhold copy, we could see how he was just looking at this sun-centered system as a hypothetical mathematical device.

55:21.062 --> 55:24.865
And out of the teaching tradition in

55:25.047 --> 55:30.515
In Wittenberg, there came some studies of these astronomical hypotheses.

55:31.316 --> 55:40.530
Now, I've got to find another book, which is very key for this, and let me see how easily I can do it.

55:40.550 --> 55:46.960
Looks like an original pigskin writing, doesn't it, huh?

55:46.980 --> 55:47.721
No, I've got a lot of them like that.

55:47.741 --> 55:50.265
Here we go.

55:50.285 --> 55:53.890
What I discovered was that Reinhold's notes

55:54.275 --> 56:11.435
which he had started making on that subject, were then worked up by his student, Poytzer, but they were published first in this pirated edition out of Strasbourg in 15... You have to go always to the back of one of these early books to find out.

56:11.595 --> 56:16.601
I don't even find it there.

56:17.542 --> 56:21.747
I guess in that case you have to look when the dedication is dated.

56:21.767 --> 56:22.628
I think it's...

56:23.333 --> 56:25.075
1568.

56:26.097 --> 56:29.542
Well, this book is a real rarity.

56:31.204 --> 56:32.986
What's the title of this?

56:33.828 --> 56:37.152
I wouldn't even try it.

56:37.813 --> 56:45.204
This one, I thought, well, if I'm going to bid several times over the estimated bid, I will be sure to get it.

56:45.804 --> 56:51.973
But unfortunately, it took only one other reader of my article about the importance of this

56:52.207 --> 57:15.390
I didn't think anybody in the book business would have read that article, but it turned out that a former History of Science student who had gone into the rare book trade bid it away from me, and I had to wait several years until he decided that he needed to remodel his house, and he would dispense with some of the books.

57:16.190 --> 57:17.752
Were you the underbidder?

57:17.772 --> 57:18.252
Of course.

57:18.272 --> 57:19.834
Where was this sale?

57:20.067 --> 57:21.729
In Germany, I think.

57:21.749 --> 57:23.170
Did you go specifically to get there?

57:23.190 --> 57:24.512
Oh, I didn't go to the auction.

57:24.632 --> 57:25.092
You had an agent.

57:25.213 --> 57:26.013
I got an agent.

57:26.314 --> 57:27.595
Yeah, you get an agent.

57:27.655 --> 57:33.381
If you're going to be bidding, say, three or four times the estimated bid, you don't want to tip off the auctioneer.

57:33.962 --> 57:34.182
Sure.

57:34.983 --> 57:39.868
You can never be sure, but in general, I find that German auctions are honest.

57:39.888 --> 57:44.293
I've found I have some suspicions about some other options.

57:45.474 --> 57:49.939
If you put in a high bid and it comes in exactly on your high bid,

57:50.240 --> 57:52.403
you really wonder if there was an under there.

57:54.326 --> 58:05.641
In any event, this book is so rare that it hasn't, this is, as far as we know, the only copy that's passed through the market in the 20th century.

58:06.162 --> 58:07.704
So I was really pleased to get it.

58:08.124 --> 58:19.099
Well, this guy, Conrad Dasipodius, who put out this pirate edition that says in the preface, he doesn't know whose it is, but it's interesting, and so he's publishing it.

58:19.231 --> 58:23.896
and he dedicates it to William the long grave of Hesse.

58:23.916 --> 58:29.162
Well, hardly has he done that when there is an agonized cry from Wittenberg.

58:30.003 --> 58:35.949
Caspar Poitzer saying, but he knew full well whose it was, and he knew it wasn't his.

58:37.471 --> 58:39.453
And so Caspar Poitzer publishes it.

58:40.634 --> 58:44.418
Now, this is in a box because it's very curious.

58:45.219 --> 58:47.061
It is bound in velvet.

58:47.564 --> 58:50.188
and you very rarely see a book bound in velvet.

58:50.649 --> 58:54.475
It doesn't last too long, and you can see it's very scruffy.

58:55.276 --> 59:04.530
So, fortunately, it's scruffy, because otherwise some dealer would have bought the thing as an object without worrying about what was in it.

59:05.832 --> 59:12.282
This time through, I got my friend who had bought the other one to agree not to bid against me.

59:13.424 --> 59:15.006
Have you read this?

59:15.357 --> 59:17.680
I mean, is this something you've actually penetrated?

59:17.720 --> 59:20.223
Well, I've looked at it enough to have an idea about it.

59:20.944 --> 59:22.186
So it's very curious.

59:22.246 --> 59:24.489
It's another astronomical book, of course.

59:24.569 --> 59:28.955
It's another version, but now this is what you might call the authorized edition.

59:29.415 --> 59:33.521
And notice that it is also dedicated to William, the Landgrave of Hesse.

59:34.722 --> 59:37.005
All right, there's a signature on the title page.

59:37.966 --> 59:44.655
You can't tell immediately what it is, but having seen it before, I know it is Herman, Landgrave of Hesse.

59:45.040 --> 59:47.503
the grandson of the dedicatee.

59:48.204 --> 59:57.455
Well, it turns out that a velvet binding is the most expensive binding you can make in the 16th century, unless you're encrusting the jewels or something.

59:57.475 --> 01:00:00.859
So, it was reserved only for nobility and so on.

01:00:00.879 --> 01:00:06.346
So, probably, this is the dedication copy of the book, which was in the family.

01:00:06.607 --> 01:00:06.927
Sure.

01:00:06.947 --> 01:00:08.909
And I've had it passed down through several generations.

01:00:09.250 --> 01:00:13.495
And the grandson, who also got interested in astronomy, put his name in it.

01:00:13.964 --> 01:00:16.187
So what would the English title of this book be?

01:00:16.647 --> 01:00:20.692
Astronomical Hypotheses, or The Theory of the Pilots.

01:00:22.454 --> 01:00:34.669
So it is reflecting this whole idea that what Copernicus is doing is mathematical hypotheses, not the physical reality of the world.

01:00:34.729 --> 01:00:38.453
So these two books are very much part and parcel.
