00:03.001 --> 00:26.565
I just think a place like Cornell that says it's leading the world in digitizing books ought to be proud of that fact.

00:27.587 --> 00:28.768
There's absolutely nothing wrong.

00:28.848 --> 00:31.911
In fact, it's good to try to, you know, make this stuff work.

00:32.819 --> 01:02.590
But in practice, what these digitizing programs sometimes do, I think, is make the same mistake that Caxton made when he set Mallory's Morte d'Auteur in tight, which was, it's set in tight.

01:03.616 --> 01:10.563
therefore the manuscript can simply be lost, is a thing that has no value anymore.

01:11.243 --> 01:24.056
We've sucked it into the world of print, and therefore the handwritten work is just, you know, it's valueless.

01:25.237 --> 01:31.783
So that's why the manuscripts that Paxton worked from were lost.

01:32.337 --> 01:44.372
Because, and many manuscripts, I'm told, I'm not by any means, you know, an expert in the migration to print, but many manuscripts were lost in it because once they were set in title.

01:44.392 --> 01:45.673
I'll give you a better example.

01:45.693 --> 01:45.854
Yeah.

01:45.874 --> 01:47.396
An example that certainly doesn't look good.

01:47.436 --> 02:00.792
I love that one, but because when you read the first, and I mentioned this in my book, as a matter of fact, when you read the first photo, when you read Heming and Condell, and they say, this book is printed from the true original copies,

02:01.480 --> 02:02.602
It's honey right there.

02:02.982 --> 02:06.487
And yet, fully 50% of Shakespeare, you know, exists.

02:07.208 --> 02:15.659
You know, we had quartos for Hamlet, but you didn't have a quartos for The Tempest, and you didn't have one for Macbeth, and you didn't have one for Antony and Cleopatra.

02:15.699 --> 02:22.388
Those are three pretty big plays that would exist, that exist only because of their publication in 1623 in the Therese Folio, right?

02:23.329 --> 02:25.752
No manuscripts survive of anything.

02:25.793 --> 02:28.416
We don't know, you know, did The Pritchers,

02:28.784 --> 02:32.169
Who divided this stuff into acts and scenes?

02:32.189 --> 02:33.991
You know, the thought is maybe Ben Johnson did.

02:34.012 --> 02:42.223
Maybe Ben Johnson was the editor of the Therese Folio, because he also published his works, and he called them the works just prior to that.

02:42.904 --> 02:45.468
Did Shakespeare divide these into acts and scenes?

02:45.488 --> 02:52.158
He probably did, but wouldn't it be nice to see his, wouldn't it be nice, nice to have to work on his works?

02:52.178 --> 02:53.880
No, no, no.

02:54.147 --> 02:55.328
Totally gone.

02:55.729 --> 03:07.100
And once they printed, and the first folio was a beautiful print job, you know, for the most part, has some 17th century era that you'd expect.

03:08.562 --> 03:12.326
Either they tossed the originals, or they were, you know.

03:13.247 --> 03:18.512
But that's all 36 plays that are in the first folio gone.

03:19.313 --> 03:22.216
And that's, I think, what you're saying.

03:22.236 --> 03:23.918
And I hadn't thought of it

03:24.370 --> 03:26.253
at all as an example here.

03:27.454 --> 03:37.048
Well, but any new technology is very exciting and it's lots of fun.

03:37.889 --> 03:50.547
And always the temptation is to devalue the old technology because it's so hard

03:51.758 --> 03:53.501
to make the new one work properly.

03:53.521 --> 03:54.402
It's a lot of work.

03:54.482 --> 04:19.082
So you kind of say, well, you know, these books are disintegrating or they're not being read or we've got to get away from the warehouse mentality or, you know, any number of ways of saying what we used to do is no good because we are in a new world where we can store things

04:19.467 --> 04:32.238
a different way, and it's a very useful way of storing things for a number of, I mean, it's nice to go to search through all of Swift or something to find a particular word.

04:32.939 --> 04:44.729
But a lot of bad, this is the point at which bad things happen to the history of ideas, and this is the point where we actually lose things.

04:44.749 --> 04:49.373
And the only way that losses will be prevented

04:49.724 --> 05:16.654
is that people who really know about what it takes to do complicated research projects think about how they go about research and then say, no, because you have a certain number of books digitized does not mean that I have an equivalent, that I am just as well served this way.

05:16.934 --> 05:19.377
Would you please proceed with,

05:19.930 --> 05:37.327
with all your well-funded digital projects, but always include in the budget for them some tiny fraction for the preservation of the source copies, either the card catalogs, the books, the manuscripts, whatever.

05:37.607 --> 05:45.955
I mean, nobody would think of scanning Twain's papers and then throwing away Twain's papers, but as soon as

05:46.205 --> 05:54.573
when it's a book and the feeling is always that there are multiple copies, it's like the passenger pigeon.

05:54.773 --> 05:57.776
I mean, there are always multiple copies until there aren't multiple copies.

05:57.796 --> 06:08.968
I mean, we have no nationwide or worldwide way of checking right now that works properly about whether there are duplicates of a given book.

06:08.988 --> 06:10.809
It doesn't happen yet.

06:11.210 --> 06:14.473
So when a library decides, looks at a book and says,

06:16.124 --> 06:24.496
Well, this book was printed in 1911, and it's damaged, and we're not a research librarian anymore.

06:24.516 --> 06:27.560
Let's check it.

06:29.543 --> 06:31.766
They may be checking the last copy of that book.

06:31.786 --> 06:32.267
We don't know.

06:32.788 --> 06:35.111
What I'd like somebody to do is actually do a study.

06:35.692 --> 06:39.437
Find out the books that are... Did I mention this to you?

06:39.938 --> 06:41.160
I want somebody to do this.

06:41.220 --> 06:44.865
I can't do it because I'm not qualified, but a research

06:45.284 --> 06:59.340
librarian, somebody who's doing something, to go to the Library of Congress, find out all the books that the Library of Congress has had to get rid of, either because they've been stolen or damaged beyond repair or gone missing somehow.

06:59.360 --> 07:03.224
I guess we're going to be in two weeks talking to the head of preservation of the Library of Congress.

07:03.244 --> 07:09.611
Well, that's great because the nice thing, here the Library of Congress is sort of our greatest depository library.

07:09.631 --> 07:09.931
It is.

07:10.052 --> 07:11.373
It dwarfs everything else.

07:11.713 --> 07:14.076
And everybody always thinks, well, I can throw this away because

07:14.613 --> 07:17.237
No matter what happens, it'll always be at the Library of Congress.

07:17.317 --> 07:19.300
But you and I know that that's not true.

07:19.741 --> 07:27.533
We also know that they've done studying and found that, you know, a given library only overlaps another given huge library by about 30%.

07:27.653 --> 07:43.557
So I'd like to know, I would like somebody to, you know, go through all the lost books at the Library of Congress and then find out are there any of those that are lost

07:44.161 --> 07:46.004
to all other libraries.

07:46.024 --> 07:54.738
In other words, was this the last copy in the United States, or is this a book that has two books in it?

07:54.758 --> 07:58.864
Of course, there's lots of ephemera that has no duplicate.

07:58.945 --> 08:11.805
Ken Carpenter at Harvard, who I'm talking about, he gave me some cases in the book that was at Knox College that

08:14.603 --> 08:17.407
That's the real problem about talking about all this.

08:18.268 --> 08:28.422
But that one story about concrete is, I mean, if you're interested in that and doing history there, that's a horrible loss, a big gaping hole in your sources.

08:29.383 --> 08:43.783
But to somebody who's interested in, I don't know, the fabrication of umbrellas and everything, all these losses are piecemeals.

08:44.320 --> 08:47.124
And each individual book is a small thing.

08:47.565 --> 08:50.870
But, of course, the run of a newspaper.

08:51.310 --> 09:03.388
So it's very hard to make people understand why this is, you know, why they're tossing out all these thousands of books.

09:03.408 --> 09:05.852
It's bad, because each book is a small battle.

09:05.892 --> 09:13.703
I mean, you could say, well, the library doesn't hurt that much if this book on ethics is no longer on the shelves, because there are lots of other books on it.

09:14.392 --> 09:30.972
So that little battle can't be fought incrementally because we're talking about this whole, this complete entity that is offering the public something that they can't get anywhere else.

09:31.092 --> 09:40.804
And all those little incremental hits that it takes add up to

09:41.392 --> 09:48.940
Well, we lose something, and you say, well, I say, well, all right, so it's a little least fake when we're talking about this.

09:48.960 --> 10:05.478
All right, but if you're a student of the book of the textile industry in the U.S., if you're a student of the Industrial Revolution in America, if you're a student of the harnessing of water power, I mean, that would be of interest.

10:05.558 --> 10:09.002
If you're a feminist scholar and you're interested in the use

10:09.455 --> 10:14.062
of women in the industrial work park, which is all the mill girls were.

10:15.484 --> 10:23.696
This is a primary resource for all of these areas, and it's lost.

10:25.178 --> 10:27.161
And somebody went in to find it, and it was gone.

10:27.341 --> 10:30.045
It was gone, and nobody knows.

10:30.065 --> 10:37.656
You know, when I was up at Cornell, and I had lunch with it, it's important that these

10:38.193 --> 10:50.391
The primary reason for a book that has up-to-date current information, that's the sort of reason that library administrators want to have books, is not always the reason.

10:50.411 --> 10:58.823
Sometimes you're interested in the history of a publisher or the history of technology, so you want to find out how things were done 100 years ago.

10:58.904 --> 11:02.689
And all those other secondary reasons can sometimes be more important.

11:02.729 --> 11:06.715
So a book that's of minor interest as a

11:07.606 --> 11:17.895
primary reference object to tell you true things about the world and have enormous interest secondarily, or a tick collection or something, as you said.

11:17.915 --> 11:19.176
Funny, isn't it?

11:19.196 --> 11:19.397
Yeah.

11:19.417 --> 11:22.640
It's a good little story, isn't it, the tick collection?

11:22.940 --> 11:36.432
Well, what I find is when you make arguments like that, the kind of library administrators who are simply uninterested in the past don't know how things can have secondary interest

11:37.070 --> 11:41.096
start making these sneery things about, oh, well, you'd save everything in your refrigerator.

11:41.116 --> 11:55.175
Oh, you know, why don't you, I bet you, you know, I bet you have a problem throwing away your, your, the wrappers on your bologna or something.

11:55.195 --> 12:06.891
I mean, there's, they kind of, they kind of leap from something that is, is a complicated thing that's potentially of interest, hard to predict how,

12:07.411 --> 12:12.417
to something that's garbage.

12:12.457 --> 12:20.226
And that's why the computer industry is going to have such a difficult time telling its own history.

12:21.187 --> 12:24.431
I log onto the WELL.

12:24.932 --> 12:36.726
The WELL is one of the most important electronic bulletin boards for the early history of WELL, online communities, all that stuff.

12:37.313 --> 12:41.738
I'm a laycomer, I've only been on the well since 93, right?

12:41.758 --> 12:43.180
And I think it started in 85.

12:44.141 --> 13:04.925
And they evolved the conventions, the different kinds of etiquette, the whole vocabulary evolved on the well that then, in some cases, spread out to the larger kind of... You know if I'm starting this year, that's fascinating.

13:04.945 --> 13:05.886
Computer...

13:06.271 --> 13:15.961
But what's sad about the well is it had no understanding of its own historical importance.

13:15.981 --> 13:24.210
And therefore, most of what was on the well in those early years, 1985, 86, is gone.

13:24.230 --> 13:35.822
There's no way that you can study the development of one of the earliest and most interesting electronic communities and how it might have influenced this larger web that we've got now.

13:36.275 --> 13:43.545
Because the source is gone, even though electronic storage is a piece of cake.

13:43.665 --> 13:45.808
I mean, you know, they could have kept the tapes.

13:45.848 --> 13:51.175
They could have kept the, what they've done is kept, you know, best of the well.

13:51.295 --> 13:52.897
So you get a few little sample things.

13:52.917 --> 13:53.958
That's somebody's choice.

13:54.139 --> 13:54.399
Right.

13:54.419 --> 13:55.661
That's somebody's selection.

13:55.681 --> 14:02.670
But you don't get, but periodically, as an anthology, the leaders of each conference go through and purge out

14:03.123 --> 14:06.768
The sanitizing history is what they're doing.

14:06.788 --> 14:13.496
Well, and the argument can be made, well, we've got to get the stuff off of the well when you see it, you know, you don't want to clutter it up.

14:14.558 --> 14:19.665
But my feeling is, you know, that's what backup tapes are for.

14:19.765 --> 14:30.058
You know, that way, 30 years from now, assuming we have the software that's available that can read these old, you know, what would be old antiquated tapes, we would want to know that.

14:30.410 --> 14:35.756
But I don't think even now that the well is saving copies of it.

14:35.817 --> 14:44.147
And who knows, you know, maybe some Nobel laureate in 30 years from now will have been posting crazy messages on the sciences.

14:44.887 --> 14:48.872
That version of Juvenile.

14:49.193 --> 14:49.553
Right.

14:49.573 --> 14:57.443
And there are a lot of writers and people who then became kind of computer pundits who spent time on the well.

14:57.463 --> 15:00.366
It would be very interesting to see their opinions

15:00.835 --> 15:06.203
evolved and the source of their ideas, and all that stuff has passed and it's lost.

15:06.303 --> 15:07.264
Most of it is lost.

15:07.284 --> 15:12.492
See, I'm interested, and I don't know how I'm going to develop a chapter on annotated books.

15:13.193 --> 15:14.775
I think that people learn.

15:14.795 --> 15:15.296
Right, right.

15:15.316 --> 15:16.137
It's fascinating.

15:16.157 --> 15:16.518
Oh, yeah.

15:16.538 --> 15:20.684
And this Paul Ducard, you know Paul, who lives over here at D.U.G.

15:20.744 --> 15:22.687
writing, one of Melissa's friends.

15:23.068 --> 15:23.168
Yeah.

15:23.188 --> 15:24.109
I had a pleasure in this.

15:24.899 --> 15:27.982
He emailed me something last night.

15:28.162 --> 15:33.228
Cambridge University actually has a separate, discreet collection of an annotated book.

15:33.508 --> 15:34.389
Coleridge.

15:34.469 --> 15:38.513
Coleridge is a big annotated book.

15:38.934 --> 15:40.956
There's a whole book on Coleridge.

15:41.036 --> 15:42.778
I believe Yale.

15:44.700 --> 15:47.643
In my book, the new book, Owen Gingrich.

15:47.743 --> 15:49.945
Owen Gingrich.

15:50.127 --> 15:51.228
Missing.

15:51.248 --> 15:54.913
This is a missing... Missing first, or missing list.

15:54.933 --> 16:00.520
I don't know if it's a one or an L. Missing underlined list, I think.

16:01.461 --> 16:06.828
It's actually, and this is the thing that I downloaded.

16:07.889 --> 16:13.136
This is what I did.

16:13.236 --> 16:14.257
This zipped file.

16:14.377 --> 16:15.779
Zipped is a compression utility.

16:16.360 --> 16:18.362
It's what I downloaded from the

16:18.545 --> 16:23.833
And it's 2,282,221.

16:24.013 --> 16:29.501
Essentially 32 megabytes of stuff.

16:29.522 --> 16:33.067
You have to unzip it, though, to get all those.

16:33.688 --> 16:34.108
Hi.

16:35.090 --> 16:35.571
How are you?

16:36.652 --> 16:37.413
Hi there, Geibel.

16:43.022 --> 16:43.523
How are you?

16:44.985 --> 16:45.726
Nice to meet you.

16:47.408 --> 16:47.809
Thank you.

16:48.515 --> 16:51.338
My name is Nick too.

16:52.539 --> 16:57.323
Yeah.

16:57.343 --> 17:04.650
So look, so I downloaded WD Report Zip, Withdrawn Report Zip.

17:04.670 --> 17:15.140
And then I used PK Unzip, which is this program I'm giving it to you too, to unzip it, meaning, you know, to decompress it.

17:15.160 --> 17:17.222
Okay.

17:18.181 --> 17:21.845
And then... And you're in Norton desktop.

17:22.085 --> 17:24.287
Well, that's just like Windows.

17:24.407 --> 17:29.552
It's just a fancy or an old-fashioned... It's now, you know, four years old.

17:29.612 --> 17:32.555
So I can get into this through regular Windows stuff.

17:32.715 --> 17:32.855
Right.

17:32.875 --> 17:34.717
Just absolutely regular Windows.

17:34.737 --> 17:38.621
And this is what the disk looks like.

17:38.641 --> 17:39.282
It's just like that.

17:39.302 --> 17:41.664
A hundred megabytes of stuff.

17:43.446 --> 17:47.850
But I wanted to... I think I have a time crunch here, but I wanted to save...

17:48.083 --> 17:49.004
Take a little time.

17:49.024 --> 17:50.526
The XL ones, too.

17:52.468 --> 17:55.691
Until he said $50, so that's plenty of time.

17:55.711 --> 18:03.179
Let's get, uh... I'll save, uh... Oh, it's a car.

18:03.199 --> 18:08.144
I have it.

18:08.164 --> 18:08.905
Sweet boy.

18:09.045 --> 18:09.706
Lovely.

18:12.669 --> 18:14.811
How old is he?

18:14.831 --> 18:15.432
Uh, he's three.

18:15.952 --> 18:16.453
All right.

18:19.252 --> 18:20.935
Okay, here are my Excel files.

18:21.215 --> 18:22.657
Okay, now let's see.

18:22.677 --> 18:25.001
Now, what I did... What's this stuff?

18:25.021 --> 18:26.904
Those are the zeros in there.

18:27.946 --> 18:28.767
Let's take a look at it.

18:30.349 --> 18:34.837
This is Excel as a spreadsheet program, like Lotus 1-2-3.

18:34.917 --> 18:35.297
Okay.

18:36.139 --> 18:46.575
And this nice man, Kasim Visram, took that thing that I showed you that I downloaded, and he...

18:48.547 --> 18:49.949
He downloaded it from me.

18:50.730 --> 18:52.311
No, he downloaded it from the same place.

18:54.754 --> 19:01.142
Okay, so this is the... Oh, this is the way.

19:01.162 --> 19:02.704
I sorted this one by call number.

19:03.044 --> 19:05.507
So these are all Chinese books that were discarded.

19:06.308 --> 19:11.054
Okay, so we can start with several things.

19:11.074 --> 19:18.182
The automation department tells me that this list that I got is...

19:18.365 --> 19:24.173
mostly, it's almost, there's some books from earlier eras, but it mostly is from 95.

19:26.958 --> 19:32.085
I think it's 1-1-95 to 4-1-96.

19:32.906 --> 19:40.678
So we've got here something like, well... Let me interrupt for a second.

19:40.698 --> 19:45.304
I mean, the significance of what you just showed me in San Francisco with all those Chinese books.

19:46.686 --> 19:47.848
One of the most

19:48.183 --> 19:53.949
undoubtedly the most important Chinese-American population in the country.

19:54.809 --> 19:56.911
They dumped a bunch of Chinese books.

19:56.931 --> 19:59.394
You're talking about all these affinity centers and reaching out?

19:59.694 --> 20:05.079
Well, they were given a huge gift of Chinese books, probably.

20:05.099 --> 20:09.484
And so they didn't have enough room to hold the Chinese books they had.

20:10.024 --> 20:11.505
Here's the last checked out date.

20:12.366 --> 20:13.567
That's pretty recent.

20:13.587 --> 20:15.169
Okay, this is last checked.

20:15.790 --> 20:18.533
Look, these are all in the 1990s, for God's sakes.

20:18.553 --> 20:19.234
Right.

20:19.534 --> 20:22.978
It was 195, I mean, right up until the day they dumped it.

20:23.258 --> 20:24.219
Right, right.

20:24.239 --> 20:25.360
That was probably pretty cool.

20:25.581 --> 20:27.623
M-I-T-T-L-E, Middleman Ear.

20:28.984 --> 20:29.805
Now, what is this here?

20:29.985 --> 20:32.408
These are the authors.

20:32.428 --> 20:34.190
These are the authors, but, okay.

20:34.210 --> 20:43.620
Okay, so this should be, my spreadsheet doesn't know how to handle these long book codes for some reason, so it gives me this strange number.

20:43.955 --> 20:47.120
This should be the item number, which is their computer item number.

20:48.361 --> 20:51.246
And on another version of the list, I have all the item numbers.

20:51.306 --> 20:57.555
But when I turn it into this spreadsheet thing and then sort it, for some reason it gives me this strange thing.

20:57.675 --> 20:59.498
So we have the last checked out date.

20:59.518 --> 21:03.203
And then this list has two yeses.

21:03.324 --> 21:06.769
This is a list of all the books that have two yeses in these two categories.

21:07.470 --> 21:11.295
Last branch, last copy of the branches, and last copy of the main.

21:11.496 --> 21:12.477
That's Matt Code?

21:12.777 --> 21:14.639
Material code.

21:15.119 --> 21:16.681
And then it says last branch.

21:16.901 --> 21:18.062
Last branch, last main.

21:18.082 --> 21:19.283
Okay, I'm sorry.

21:19.303 --> 21:29.233
Well, these are complicated, difficult to interpret numbers, because even though it says last branch, last main, in some cases, when I double-check, it turns out there is a dupe.

21:29.253 --> 21:34.378
So this list, which I have, which is a total of something like 18,000-plus books.

21:34.398 --> 21:39.763
So it's suspect in some... It is not all the books that are listed as the last copy.

21:39.845 --> 22:08.029
are because they could have thrown it away and then because it was damaged and then bought a replacement copy so there's some but but generally speaking this these 18 000 books out of a larger number of whatever several hundred thousand that were discarded are the last copies in the system now to me you know these dates these dates to some of these people might say hey this book hasn't been used in two years to me every one of these shows

22:08.262 --> 22:11.725
So here we got Chinese.

22:12.006 --> 22:13.687
The Chinese goes on for a long time.

22:13.727 --> 22:16.750
And look at all the 95s, 94s, 93s, 92s.

22:17.050 --> 22:18.112
These were used books.

22:18.772 --> 22:19.833
Oh, yeah.

22:21.114 --> 22:23.477
This is damning information.

22:23.497 --> 22:24.177
This really is.

22:24.197 --> 22:26.339
Although you know what could be true?

22:27.841 --> 22:29.783
I think I asked him about that.

22:29.863 --> 22:31.304
Who's he now?

22:31.625 --> 22:35.368
The automation guy, Steve McLaughlin.

22:35.849 --> 22:37.290
He said maybe...

22:38.097 --> 22:48.911
Maybe that date, say 2-21-96, when they ran the barcode off the last time to withdraw it, it would have registered as a checkout.

22:49.111 --> 22:49.411
Yeah?

22:49.832 --> 22:51.534
How do you explain 5-19-89?

22:51.895 --> 22:54.878
My feeling is that probably this is the last time checked out.

22:54.898 --> 23:01.066
But all the numbers that they have to... In which case, they should all be within a couple of months of each other.

23:01.106 --> 23:02.929
Right, right.

23:02.949 --> 23:04.070
These are all over the block.

23:04.811 --> 23:06.453
Yeah, yeah, it's strange, isn't it?

23:06.473 --> 23:07.935
All these Japanese books, okay?

23:08.185 --> 23:12.710
So you get Japanese, Chinese, Spanish, Korean, all this stuff.

23:12.730 --> 23:15.714
Then you start getting the call numbers.

23:15.734 --> 23:19.098
So here are all the bibliography books.

23:19.118 --> 23:20.139
Look at all this.

23:20.159 --> 23:21.721
Urban and Basic Bibliography.

23:24.124 --> 23:27.808
They're all truncated titles, so we don't even know what the bibliography is.

23:28.089 --> 23:29.550
However, we have the call number.

23:33.195 --> 23:34.036
This is the item number?

23:34.076 --> 23:35.998
This is a chronological item number?

23:36.181 --> 23:40.046
These are the, this is the total, we're at book number 2,760.

23:40.406 --> 23:41.668
There are 18,000 books.

23:41.708 --> 23:42.429
Right.

23:42.709 --> 23:48.817
And this particular spreadsheet program can only handle 16,000 records.

23:49.398 --> 23:55.085
But the actual number of books is, let me see if I can do that.

23:56.527 --> 23:58.189
Last call text.

24:04.447 --> 24:08.292
is 18,000 because I used a different program to count them.

24:10.755 --> 24:15.962
All of this is compressed into that one disk?

24:16.342 --> 24:20.067
This one, last main, where's my last tab?

24:20.087 --> 24:20.648
Yeah, here we go.

24:20.768 --> 24:21.909
Last tab text.

24:23.231 --> 24:25.834
Okay, now if I, I'm hoping this will work for me here.

24:26.715 --> 24:33.424
If I do edit, and I use this editor, this

24:34.062 --> 24:35.564
editor, it cranks for a while.

24:37.266 --> 24:41.993
And it gives me this, it gives me a line count, see?

24:42.694 --> 24:53.328
This is what the Unix guy, the Unix guy sorted the list that I was given and put tabs in place of the Unix commands or something.

24:53.348 --> 25:00.058
So, and here's the list, exactly as it came in, except with tabs.

25:00.278 --> 25:01.299
These are important books.

25:01.379 --> 25:03.242
I mean, I recognize Women Who Kill.

25:03.863 --> 25:05.746
The Origins of Intelligence.

25:07.448 --> 25:07.989
Right, right.

25:08.269 --> 25:12.295
Philosophical fragments, characters, Jacques Melitin.

25:13.737 --> 25:23.069
But look, so the way to count, okay, there's 19,007 lines in this document, and each line represents one book.

25:24.752 --> 25:29.098
Okay, so those are... 19,000 books.

25:29.758 --> 25:32.402
That is a subset of the total number of books.

25:32.467 --> 25:39.595
That's all the books that say last main and last branch, last copy main, last copy branch.

25:40.095 --> 25:49.065
The larger file is so big that I don't have any text editor that can give me a line count, because it just crashes every time I try it.

25:49.526 --> 25:52.809
I tried it just now before you came, and it doesn't work.

25:52.829 --> 25:58.976
It says insufficient memory, because the file is too big for my, for this, anything that I have.

25:58.996 --> 26:00.718
And so the parameters here that you, that

26:00.968 --> 26:29.389
these are last copy books in the system is that right essentially essentially but but you have to when you say that about any particular one you have to double check because it turns out that it might be you know who knows the harvard independent guide to something or other it might be that that they bought a new version of this for instance uh but i gave a list this was the thing that i used when i wrote the letter to the new york times

26:29.875 --> 26:38.105
which I gave you, saying, you know, there's no possible excuse for books like this to be included.

26:38.225 --> 26:42.210
I checked every one of the ones that I... I pulled them off this list.

26:42.230 --> 26:44.192
And then I... So, for instance, let's see.

26:44.212 --> 26:46.695
I don't know.

26:46.715 --> 26:51.762
What was it I was interested in with Rivers... Rivers of America, I thought it was.

26:51.782 --> 26:52.703
Oh, not find files.

26:52.723 --> 26:56.367
I want to search... Is it Rivers of America?

26:56.487 --> 26:58.870
Rivers of North America, I think, right?

26:58.890 --> 26:59.511
Rivers of North America, yeah.

27:05.549 --> 27:07.331
Rivers of North America, Russell.

27:07.731 --> 27:08.812
Okay, so we know.

27:08.872 --> 27:12.716
Now, this is interesting.

27:12.836 --> 27:19.502
Now, 2-13-96, that could have been the discard date, because we could check with the book.

27:20.043 --> 27:28.771
If the book isn't stamped, we know that when they ran the barcode to withdraw it, that was the date that it was recorded as last check.

27:28.791 --> 27:30.492
All right, so then.

27:30.512 --> 27:31.033
But look at this.

27:31.453 --> 27:35.337
So here they've got Rivers of North America, Lakes of North America,

27:36.599 --> 27:42.868
This was where it really took a hit on this particular... Here's the evolution of the ear structure.

27:43.008 --> 27:46.453
Two copies of that book, several copies of that book, The Infinite River.

27:47.394 --> 27:47.494
Yeah.

27:47.514 --> 27:57.429
Now, here's the community that is... Rivers are very important to this place, and the history of rivers, and, you know, any number of... Water.

27:57.929 --> 28:02.596
Water is important to the Bay Area, and they threw out lots of water books.

28:04.038 --> 28:05.560
It's just, you know, figure out.

28:05.894 --> 28:10.720
Anyway, let's go back to this last call thing, because it's a little bit easier to read.

28:10.960 --> 28:23.034
And you can find that book also, I think, is also here, because I think it made it into this list.

28:23.055 --> 28:24.336
You can see it searching here.

28:24.396 --> 28:28.581
Rivers of North America, Israel, Roswell Lakes of North America.

28:28.942 --> 28:32.546
So here it is, sorted by call number, the way it was in the one.

28:33.026 --> 28:34.348
It was sort of hard to read there, but

28:35.510 --> 28:38.634
the structure of the ear.

28:40.135 --> 28:45.321
Paleocurrents and basin analysis was one that just blew me away.

28:46.563 --> 28:48.985
You see, now, here's a lot of 213-96.

28:49.065 --> 28:49.406
Right.

28:50.807 --> 28:51.929
A lot of 213-96.

28:52.009 --> 28:52.269
Right.

28:52.649 --> 28:59.017
So probably the weaving party went through, and 213-96, they filled the cart with books, and then the barcode.

28:59.397 --> 29:02.681
That argues very persuasively for that, too.

29:02.701 --> 29:02.901
Right.

29:04.653 --> 29:06.115
It wouldn't be great if it wasn't Flaherty.

29:09.921 --> 29:11.563
I think I'm not going to check the calendar.

29:12.144 --> 29:14.027
No, you're a better man than I am.

29:14.427 --> 29:16.049
Everybody has a calendar for anything.

29:17.011 --> 29:21.237
So I checked.

29:22.459 --> 29:26.825
So now we know sort of the process, why those books got in the discard room.

29:27.506 --> 29:29.629
They went through it.

29:30.490 --> 29:31.852
But it doesn't explain 618-91.

29:31.973 --> 29:33.715
No.

29:34.657 --> 29:35.418
It doesn't.

29:35.438 --> 29:36.939
And I don't know why those books are there.

29:37.560 --> 29:42.906
I don't know if they, in some cases, they weren't, you know, they had it set in a different way of the software.

29:42.946 --> 29:48.031
Yeah, there's evidence to back up what he said, but there's also evidence to suggest something else, too.

29:48.051 --> 29:48.311
Yeah.

29:48.772 --> 29:54.999
I mean, this guy that I'm talking, the automation guy, is in a very tricky position.

29:55.059 --> 29:56.620
I think he's a fundamentally nice guy.

29:56.740 --> 29:57.781
He's a smart guy.

29:57.801 --> 29:59.263
They're scared over there, by the way.

29:59.513 --> 30:04.541
They're not exactly looking forward to my arrival tomorrow morning, a lot of them.

30:04.561 --> 30:07.385
They're willing to talk to me, you know, coffee, blah, blah, blah.

30:08.106 --> 30:08.807
We'll see.

30:08.847 --> 30:11.992
This is fascinating.

30:12.413 --> 30:13.695
So that's the list that I got.

30:13.855 --> 30:15.277
Actually, that isn't the list that I got.

30:15.297 --> 30:20.625
The list that I got was the bigger list that I can't show you on this system.

30:21.186 --> 30:25.393
But this is, you know, for my purposes, this is extraordinary.

30:25.873 --> 30:26.234
Yeah, okay.

30:26.274 --> 30:26.955
So we're...

30:27.290 --> 30:32.836
And you got this by making a formal request, right?

30:33.216 --> 30:36.740
I mean, this wasn't something to get under the table, so to speak.

30:37.180 --> 30:47.050
No, this was part of that suit where I said, look, I want a list of all records relating to discarding, weeding, and everything like that.

30:47.070 --> 30:50.393
And they gave me a bunch of stuff, and they said, no record exists.

30:50.413 --> 30:51.995
There is, however, this computer file.

30:52.676 --> 30:57.060
And I said, okay, if it's on 40 discs, I'll take it, and blah, blah, blah.

30:57.580 --> 30:58.882
And then we worked out a better way.

30:58.982 --> 31:03.328
It was just that I would download it from their website using FTP.

31:04.089 --> 31:05.030
FTP.

31:05.651 --> 31:07.293
File Transfer Protocol.

31:08.114 --> 31:09.015
Do I need that, too?

31:09.176 --> 31:09.796
I don't need that.

31:09.877 --> 31:11.919
What do I need to see this at home?

31:12.019 --> 31:13.381
You need a zip drive.

31:13.702 --> 31:14.343
What kind?

31:14.363 --> 31:15.404
It's called Zip, right?

31:15.564 --> 31:17.006
It's I-Omega.

31:17.026 --> 31:17.867
It looks like this.

31:18.228 --> 31:19.089
Okay, I know I-Omega.

31:19.349 --> 31:22.574
I-Omega Zip 100.

31:23.134 --> 31:25.157
That Zip 100 is a...

31:25.677 --> 31:41.887
state-of-the-art one that's up to... Well, they sell a bigger, fancier, fatter one, but most people, when you tell them you have a zip drive, this is what they think of, because this is the thing they've sold tens of... Now Compaq and a couple other manufacturers actually sell boxes with zip drives built in.

31:41.907 --> 31:44.371
Are you using polymer only to backup material and stuff?

31:44.592 --> 31:49.761
Yeah, because you can, instead of, you know, floppy holding whatever, some small amount,

31:50.146 --> 31:54.192
Okay, and can you just attach this to any of your computers?

31:54.372 --> 31:56.255
You know where it plugs in?

31:56.275 --> 31:57.297
The printer port.

31:57.317 --> 31:57.817
Okay, good.

31:57.837 --> 31:58.939
It just plugs in the printer port.

31:58.959 --> 32:01.483
So all of my computers, I could work this out.

32:01.503 --> 32:04.167
You don't have to do any hardware installation or anything.

32:04.187 --> 32:08.954
You just plug it in the printer port, then run their install software, and it works.

32:08.974 --> 32:12.900
And then you put this disk in, and then how do you access it?

32:13.921 --> 32:15.664
Well, you have to have that.

32:15.684 --> 32:18.448
In order to read...

32:19.897 --> 32:20.598
Good question.

32:20.898 --> 32:26.263
In order to read the one that I showed you here, you have to have Microsoft Excel.

32:26.764 --> 32:41.598
So if you have their business suite of software, you know, you have Microsoft Word, then you... Do you write with Microsoft Excel?

32:41.918 --> 32:42.498
No.

32:43.579 --> 32:47.984
It's normally for financial accounting stuff, but you can sort with it.

32:48.464 --> 32:49.465
I could sort this

32:50.018 --> 32:51.620
by alphabetical.

32:51.940 --> 32:53.542
So you have Microsoft Excel.

32:53.782 --> 32:54.543
Right, right.

32:54.783 --> 32:55.824
And did you get it just for this?

32:56.505 --> 32:57.866
No, I got it to do my taxes.

32:57.966 --> 32:58.367
Okay.

33:00.809 --> 33:04.493
But you could use, also use Lotus 1, 2, 3, I think.

33:04.773 --> 33:07.696
I know somebody who has Microsoft Excel.

33:07.716 --> 33:07.977
Okay.

33:08.697 --> 33:15.064
But let's just double check that, okay, we want to save last one.

33:19.685 --> 33:22.008
You call it landfill, huh?

33:22.408 --> 33:25.072
I call that directory landfill.

33:25.092 --> 33:36.206
Although that's actually not a fair name for it, because I don't have, I don't, only some of the books that we're looking at here went to landfill.

33:36.226 --> 33:39.009
But it's a residence.

33:39.470 --> 33:42.093
Some of them were given away in those big giveaways.

33:42.554 --> 33:45.758
But from my point of view, both are wrong, because, you know.

33:45.778 --> 33:47.159
Look at all the Chinese books.

33:47.179 --> 33:49.202
Let me just say once more for the tape.

33:49.486 --> 33:51.889
Yeah, there are a lot of those Chinese.

33:51.909 --> 33:53.451
I don't know what the story is with those.

33:53.751 --> 34:01.921
I mean, I couldn't... My own areas of strength are... It doesn't even have to be strength.

34:03.123 --> 34:09.811
The city that you're in, I mean, it goes back to getting rid of the papers up in Lowell in a certain way, doesn't it?

34:09.871 --> 34:13.695
This is central to your heritage and to your history.

34:13.715 --> 34:18.261
It would seem to me that you would want to maintain a very, very strong collection in Chinese books.

34:18.443 --> 34:19.224
It would seem to me.

34:19.284 --> 34:24.611
I don't have to be, you know, the second coming of Sir Isaac Newton to figure that one out.

34:25.993 --> 34:26.594
Why Stubbs?

34:26.874 --> 34:29.878
Well, I'm not able to evaluate.

34:30.018 --> 34:32.662
I want them to keep the Chinese books, but I can't evaluate them.

34:33.142 --> 34:39.050
But this one, like William Stubbs, 17 lectures on history.

34:39.070 --> 34:43.436
I can't remember what the actual title is, but you check it out by using their online catalog.

34:44.257 --> 34:48.282
It's a book they should never have gotten rid of.

34:48.768 --> 35:05.322
the collected papers of Adolphus Ward, Cicely Wedgwood's Velvet Studies, Studies in Modern History, English Historians, all these history books, it was foolish of them to get rid of those books.

35:05.702 --> 35:13.529
I can say that because I know a little bit, I mean, I at least have some sense I'm in the ballpark with history.

35:13.549 --> 35:18.673
And so, and I know, the sad thing is that there are not a lot of

35:20.138 --> 35:38.444
lit books on here because some of the lit sections were weeded already before this computer report, and those are the earlier purge reports that we don't have because the automation department said, you know, there's no reason to keep these.

35:38.524 --> 35:43.992
I quote that, and I have a sort of a condensed version of all that in the New Yorker piece.

35:44.012 --> 35:46.095
See, they're trying to purge the history.

35:46.379 --> 35:48.381
They don't want a record of the books that they had.

35:48.421 --> 35:51.124
It's not even important for them to know what books they had, is it?

35:51.444 --> 35:51.705
Right.

35:52.285 --> 35:56.210
Which by itself would be a pretty interesting piece of cultural information, wouldn't it?

35:56.330 --> 35:57.211
You hit it on the head.

35:57.231 --> 36:03.938
I mean, you want to know, for instance, there's a huge German community in San Francisco.

36:04.438 --> 36:07.602
So the German collection was very strong.

36:08.262 --> 36:10.665
A judgment was made at some point recently

36:11.202 --> 36:14.685
to weed the German books, to weed the German collection.

36:14.725 --> 36:19.650
It should only get a two, I think, on this collection development.

36:19.670 --> 36:36.847
And so, and most, a lot of foreign literature, some of it, except for, anyway, so those books go, and then you don't know that the library was strong in German because there was a huge German center.

36:36.867 --> 36:38.188
It's really inexcusable.

36:38.776 --> 36:40.358
It's anti-intellectual.

36:40.418 --> 36:42.120
It's all that stuff.

36:42.140 --> 36:48.949
I mean, we only have nine plays by Sophocles or whatever, but at least we know the names of some of them.

36:49.950 --> 36:50.531
It helps.

36:51.031 --> 36:52.553
Maybe I'm making a big leap there.

36:52.613 --> 37:03.067
But we do know, actually, the great thing is because of concerted effort on the part of a lot of people, we do know some of what we have because we have the character.

37:03.087 --> 37:03.727
Here's a dime.

37:04.789 --> 37:04.969
Oh, yeah.

37:05.894 --> 37:08.859
Let me make sure I save the Excel file, though.

37:08.879 --> 37:09.380
Yes, okay.

37:09.400 --> 37:10.962
I'm going to put my cup out in the kitchen.

37:11.784 --> 37:15.049
I'm going to put the cup over here, okay?

37:15.069 --> 37:20.999
I'm going to just save, real quick, save some of these other files for you.

37:21.019 --> 37:21.560
Good.

37:21.620 --> 37:22.782
Last call number.

37:27.129 --> 37:27.951
These are my notebooks.

37:29.373 --> 37:31.817
I know I'm ready to start writing when I get 40 of these filled.

37:35.476 --> 37:52.318
If you need this back, I'll FedEx it back to you, by the way.

37:52.639 --> 37:55.602
But what I'm saying is, for some reason, you find that you're without something.

37:56.323 --> 38:00.529
No, no, no.

38:00.549 --> 38:01.390
I'm giving you copies.

38:01.851 --> 38:02.952
I'm just giving you copies.

38:03.607 --> 38:07.431
And this, I want to, you know, stress that this is an incomplete.

38:07.812 --> 38:08.372
I understand.

38:08.773 --> 38:11.316
You know, it isn't giving you the whole picture of what the library is.

38:11.336 --> 38:16.321
There's no way I'm going to be able to evaluate the whole thing, but I certainly can use it to draw examples from.

38:17.302 --> 38:18.444
Okay, it's saving.

38:18.464 --> 38:22.148
While it's saving, it's a big file, so obviously it takes a little while.

38:22.168 --> 38:25.431
Let me really quick go through and give you something else.

38:26.092 --> 38:29.937
The thing is that the library actually, did Biller give you stuff?

38:30.017 --> 38:31.578
Yeah, he's sending me everything.

38:32.079 --> 38:32.179
Okay.

38:32.513 --> 38:37.218
I said, instead of giving it to me, why don't you just send it to me, UPS, and I'll send you a check.

38:39.521 --> 38:42.465
That's what I suggested, and he likes that idea.

38:42.485 --> 38:44.207
Okay, well, I'll do the same thing.

38:44.227 --> 38:49.513
I got a lot of stuff, but there was one thing that was really, I really wanted you to see.

38:53.257 --> 38:54.919
This, this is nothing.

38:55.039 --> 38:56.181
This, you can have that.

38:56.201 --> 38:58.543
It's just that, the wonderful five-year-old.

38:58.563 --> 38:59.324
Oh, I love that.

38:59.685 --> 39:01.727
Because, look, this is what I like.

39:02.939 --> 39:07.003
The immediate goal of adding one new book per child each year was in their five-year plan.

39:07.363 --> 39:10.006
But they didn't, they built a library they wouldn't possibly develop.

39:10.466 --> 39:13.049
I've seen, I have the tape, by the way, the future library.

39:13.109 --> 39:16.713
Have you seen that tape, the limit with the Pacific Bellevue?

39:16.733 --> 39:17.313
That's wonderful.

39:17.393 --> 39:20.877
I've seen it once, yeah, that's bizarre.

39:21.858 --> 39:32.068
What I'm trying to get is, it's going to take me a while to find this probably.

39:34.225 --> 39:39.353
I want to get a copy for two things I'm looking for.

39:40.695 --> 39:54.796
One is a copy of the original thing that I sent to the New Yorker, which has a much further record of the book.

39:54.817 --> 39:59.363
But a lot of that got cut out because they cut the piece down.

40:00.065 --> 40:01.026
And so a lot of the

40:02.170 --> 40:04.434
the last copy of the stuff that I had.

40:05.416 --> 40:07.019
Look at this stuff.

40:07.059 --> 40:07.440
That's all.

40:07.480 --> 40:08.322
This is nothing.

40:08.883 --> 40:16.757
This is just... Okay.

40:18.340 --> 40:19.082
This is what I did.

40:19.102 --> 40:22.829
This was... I'll make a copy of this.

40:23.931 --> 40:25.073
I got the card catalog.

40:26.622 --> 40:29.105
And I got, I looked up Israel Russell, right?

40:29.125 --> 40:30.567
I got the drawer from the card catalog.

40:30.607 --> 40:31.909
I looked up Israel Russell.

40:31.929 --> 40:37.297
We know that he, we know that Rivers of North America and something else in North America.

40:37.437 --> 40:38.118
Lakes, I think.

40:38.178 --> 40:39.480
Lakes, okay.

40:39.500 --> 40:43.065
But these are all, all things that were in the card catalog.

40:43.665 --> 40:44.627
By Israel Russell.

40:44.647 --> 40:45.628
By Israel Russell.

40:45.648 --> 40:50.695
Existing glaciers, geology and water resources in Mez Perce, Idaho.

40:50.715 --> 40:52.618
All these geology books.

40:54.861 --> 40:55.802
But they're all gone.

40:56.575 --> 40:58.297
They're no longer in the library.

41:00.239 --> 41:06.065
Either that or possibly, I asked for all these using the card catalog.

41:06.146 --> 41:11.071
I asked for them, thinking maybe they hadn't yet put them in the online catalog because they're behind in that.

41:12.232 --> 41:13.093
But they couldn't find them.

41:13.113 --> 41:15.976
So those were already purged in an earlier thing.

41:16.357 --> 41:17.178
So there's no record.

41:17.198 --> 41:24.726
The only record is the card catalog that says these books were once in the library.

41:26.022 --> 41:30.266
Here's that card catalog, Pat, that I talked to you about.

41:30.286 --> 41:30.846
That's great.

41:31.767 --> 41:32.948
You can have that one.

41:33.028 --> 41:34.650
Oh, come on.

41:34.830 --> 41:37.673
No, no, I don't have the spirit.

41:37.693 --> 41:44.439
There was something else I was looking for that I really wanted to get to you before you went.

41:44.499 --> 41:45.099
What was it?

41:45.119 --> 41:45.400
Oh, it's fine.

41:45.420 --> 41:46.621
I know, I wanted to change it.

41:46.741 --> 41:47.642
Hey, sure.

41:47.802 --> 41:48.222
Yeah.

41:48.322 --> 41:53.447
That's great, thanks.

41:53.467 --> 41:53.667
Pat.

41:53.967 --> 41:55.869
I pulled these out the other day.

41:55.949 --> 41:57.230
These are a collector's item.

42:03.135 --> 42:03.575
That's great.

42:03.595 --> 42:10.642
See, at the end of the piece, you'll see there's a discussion of a little bit of the data processing stuff.

42:10.662 --> 42:22.192
But I have somewhere here, I have all, I have the pictures, all the photos that this one staff member took.

42:22.212 --> 42:22.692
And

42:23.701 --> 42:25.543
There's something else that I was just going to get.

42:25.884 --> 42:26.545
It'll come to me.

42:26.645 --> 42:29.128
But what I'll have to do is mail it to you.

42:29.669 --> 42:29.869
Okay.

42:29.889 --> 42:36.898
Can you burn a copy of that?

42:36.918 --> 42:40.722
This has been... This has exceeded... This, right?

42:40.883 --> 42:45.629
I should just take time and go through all this.

42:45.749 --> 42:47.731
I'm going to ask you to do something.

42:47.751 --> 42:48.612
This is the collector.

42:49.914 --> 42:50.715
Sign one for me.

42:51.476 --> 42:52.257
Inscribe it.

42:54.481 --> 42:55.683
You got a pen?

42:55.703 --> 42:56.244
Okay, good.

43:01.311 --> 43:02.513
It's like having Steve.

43:02.533 --> 43:04.336
You mean, you mean to try it to you, right?

43:04.657 --> 43:06.339
To me, to Nick Basbanes, you bet.

43:08.723 --> 43:21.442
All part of the, it's the physicality, you know, this is, there's a book I just got, I carried it right out to California, called Paratexts, have you heard of it?

43:21.462 --> 43:23.205
It's published by Cambridge University Press.
