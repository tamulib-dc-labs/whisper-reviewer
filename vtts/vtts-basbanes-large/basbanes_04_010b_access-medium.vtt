00:02.208 --> 00:09.375
The enthusiast, the triumphalist's insistence that the technology works against the print is just quite wrong.

00:09.415 --> 00:15.481
The technology is very much neutral in a way that other technologies aren't between the various forms of representation of a book.

00:15.501 --> 00:26.932
You know, one thing that does remain to be seen is there are some suggestions here in the future of the book that, well, paper doesn't last forever, but paper does last for a couple hundred years.

00:27.193 --> 00:28.654
Paper does last for a couple hundred years.

00:28.634 --> 00:30.476
Nobody really knows.

00:30.636 --> 00:39.827
I mean, it is zeros and ones when you come down to it, but nevertheless, CDs, we know, for instance, aren't forever, right?

00:40.167 --> 00:42.390
CDs have had a very long run as these technologies go.

00:43.211 --> 00:50.659
I mean, the assumption on the part of people who are doing this, who are either concerned with preserving the digital representations of paper books,

00:51.162 --> 01:11.627
or the just preserving digital artifacts, whether they originally were in paper form or whether they're things like software and video games and other kinds of artifacts that have never been paper and couldn't be represented on paper, is that you're just going to have to refresh them, is the phrase, every so many years.

01:11.667 --> 01:18.435
And part of your budget, when you did, part of the expense of digitizing them is going to be the constant cost of refreshing and making backups and making sure that

01:19.090 --> 01:26.145
because also the representations in digital form are not that stable, so you may want to make two or three of them and so on.

01:26.505 --> 01:32.919
The people who are working hardest on this and know most about it are the Commission on Preservation and Access in Washington.

01:32.939 --> 01:33.881
Have you ever talked to them?

01:33.901 --> 01:35.845
No, let's say so.

01:35.965 --> 01:37.849
Now, Duart Linn was the head of that.

01:38.170 --> 01:39.833
He was the guy who was at Cornell.

01:40.775 --> 01:41.316
He left.

01:41.376 --> 01:43.980
He was the vice chancellor for information technologies in Cornell.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.742
It's a commission for what, once again?

01:45.762 --> 01:48.266
A commission for preservation and access.

01:48.746 --> 01:49.708
And this is in Washington?

01:49.728 --> 01:50.549
They're in Washington.

01:51.250 --> 01:59.521
And they are the ones who have taken the leading role in sort of dealing with, I mean, getting the technology right, figuring out what you really need.

01:59.601 --> 02:01.084
Is that a governmental organization?

02:01.104 --> 02:02.385
No, they're a private organization.

02:02.405 --> 02:04.268
I think they're established by...

02:05.041 --> 02:07.084
I'm not, you know, I could be wrong about this.

02:07.124 --> 02:11.470
My impression is that they're established as a conspic consortium of university and research libraries.

02:11.670 --> 02:12.992
And they are based in Washington.

02:13.032 --> 02:13.773
They're based in Washington.

02:13.793 --> 02:14.254
So if I call them.

02:14.274 --> 02:15.075
Lynn was the director.

02:15.095 --> 02:16.898
Yeah, I think if you call them and just say, I want to find out.

02:16.958 --> 02:17.258
Yeah.

02:17.599 --> 02:19.381
And they have a lot of printed materials they can get.

02:19.401 --> 02:19.501
Good.

02:19.722 --> 02:20.042
Excellent.

02:20.122 --> 02:21.023
Excellent.

02:21.044 --> 02:26.391
So just to wrap that up, the...

02:27.603 --> 02:29.106
we're just going to have to keep backing them up.

02:29.126 --> 02:30.789
And there's also the problem of just compatibility.

02:30.809 --> 02:33.796
I mean, it isn't just a question of how long the physical media will endure.

02:34.317 --> 02:47.383
I guess one thing that bothers me, and of course looking at it now from a literary standpoint, not the informational end and the data and all this, and that's fine, but when you talk about creative works, literary works,

02:47.363 --> 02:48.825
There's a great concern.

02:48.885 --> 02:55.054
How do you know the original from the copy that you get on an internet?

02:55.074 --> 02:59.841
This whole concept of hypertext where the author really is not the author.

02:59.861 --> 03:02.765
It's anybody who gets into the... Well, I don't know that that's true.

03:02.785 --> 03:03.987
I think that's exaggerated.

03:04.027 --> 03:07.592
The fact that the author... I think there are still authors of hypertext.

03:08.233 --> 03:15.784
The way in which you... The way in which you work across the...

03:15.764 --> 03:20.189
The artifact is different, is determined by the reader, but that's always been the case.

03:20.209 --> 03:28.559
I mean, the fact is that somebody pointed out, I think the point's well taken, nobody ever sets down and reads Ulysses, you know, from stately plump Buck Mulligan to yes, yes, yes.

03:28.639 --> 03:31.703
I mean, you know, nobody's ever read a book like that that way.

03:32.404 --> 03:37.930
I mean, our experience of them is actually one of reading this, starting again, rereading the chapter, going back to Loretus, and so on.

03:37.950 --> 03:40.253
I mean, a linear book also has this

03:40.739 --> 03:41.501
this quality.

03:42.423 --> 03:45.611
Yeah, but I mean, where people can actually go in and tinker with the text.

03:46.454 --> 03:47.296
Well, that's one way.

03:47.336 --> 03:49.501
I mean, people can or can't do that.

03:50.003 --> 03:54.073
I don't know that that may, I mean, look, I don't, I think if you sort of ask, can there be novels?

03:54.307 --> 03:55.369
in digital form.

03:55.429 --> 03:59.034
Michael Joyce is one of the people who's... And he is somebody I'd like to talk to, by the way.

03:59.054 --> 03:59.936
He's a very interesting character.

03:59.956 --> 04:00.897
Where is he located?

04:00.917 --> 04:01.598
He's at Vassar.

04:01.898 --> 04:02.139
Is he?

04:02.399 --> 04:03.301
Okay.

04:03.601 --> 04:05.264
And are you on the web or on the net?

04:05.344 --> 04:05.824
I am, yeah.

04:05.844 --> 04:07.126
Okay, because I could send you some of this.

04:07.146 --> 04:07.747
Oh, that'd be great.

04:09.630 --> 04:13.516
I mean, you know, whether these are... He talks about interactive fictions or hyper fictions.

04:13.796 --> 04:14.658
I've seen these things.

04:14.678 --> 04:16.641
I haven't seen anything that blows me away, I have to say.

04:16.661 --> 04:21.428
But, you know, I don't know that that's, you know, that that's a fair judgment now.

04:21.813 --> 04:29.441
I don't see why there shouldn't be, there shouldn't be a medium for the expression of fiction, which isn't to say that, if you start to ask, is this a novel, that's a mug's game.

04:29.761 --> 04:32.884
I mean, to ask whether this is the same as that and so on.

04:32.924 --> 04:37.048
I mentioned this to Margaret Atwood, and she said, you know, what was Thomas Boldler?

04:37.068 --> 04:40.592
I mean, he went in and rewrote Shakespeare.

04:41.072 --> 04:43.555
She said, we have a word in the dictionary for her, Boldlerizing.

04:43.575 --> 04:48.900
There's also, I mean, there's a kind of, I mean, the things that are interesting in this media, I have a friend who's, um,

04:49.505 --> 04:57.396
who has done a lot of various kinds of CD-ROMs and virtual reality representations and so on of art historical.

04:57.716 --> 04:58.297
They just did one.

04:58.317 --> 05:02.623
He's in Rome, and they did one of the Galleria Borghese in Rome, for example.

05:02.983 --> 05:17.503
You've got every picture in the Galleria Borghese, and you can close up or move back, and you can find information about the painters and so on and make comparisons of this painter's work and that painter's work and so on as a means of representing the catalog of an institution like that.

05:17.821 --> 05:24.953
The CD-ROM is so much more versatile than a coffee table book, even if you're not going to... Well, there are some things.

05:24.993 --> 05:26.916
I've been up to Corbis, by the way.

05:27.016 --> 05:28.318
I spent a couple days up there.

05:28.339 --> 05:32.305
I interviewed Otto Bettman down in Florida.

05:32.325 --> 05:36.071
It's going to be a lot of fun, the people I'm bringing into this.

05:36.212 --> 05:40.639
But I love what they did with that Leonardo Codex.

05:40.619 --> 05:41.260
Right.

05:41.300 --> 05:47.712
The fact is you can click on any sentence and it's in Italian written backwards and you click and it'll give you a translation.

05:48.193 --> 05:50.337
I mean, a book is never going to do that for you.

05:50.417 --> 05:53.743
I just had a, I mean, this is just another, well, this is another story.

05:53.783 --> 05:57.750
I just had a, Cambridge University Press owed me a couple hundred for

05:58.000 --> 06:00.725
some readings, you know, from referees.

06:00.745 --> 06:02.108
Looking through the catalog and so on.

06:02.128 --> 06:03.350
Oh, they've got Johnson's Dictionary.

06:03.371 --> 06:04.974
I mean, I'm an electricographer first and former.

06:04.994 --> 06:07.919
They've got Don Johnson's Dictionary and CD-ROM, and, you know, that's what I want.

06:08.220 --> 06:08.901
It's about 200 pounds.

06:08.941 --> 06:09.442
That was it.

06:09.462 --> 06:10.304
Well, that's pretty good.

06:11.126 --> 06:13.571
You know, Holt has done a book on the history of dictionaries.

06:13.611 --> 06:14.472
Are you familiar with that?

06:14.492 --> 06:14.793
Who's this?

06:14.813 --> 06:15.013
No.

06:15.314 --> 06:16.737
I want to wait one.

06:16.757 --> 06:17.358
I'll get the book.

06:17.398 --> 06:17.899
Hold on.

06:28.915 --> 06:30.077
It's from Holt.

06:30.097 --> 06:33.383
It's by Jonathan Green, J-O-N-A-T-H-O-N.

06:34.104 --> 06:37.992
It's called Chasing the Sun, Dictionary Makers and the Dictionaries They Made.

06:39.554 --> 06:40.636
And it's brand new.

06:41.718 --> 06:43.301
Henry Holt.

06:43.902 --> 06:44.043
E-N-E?

06:44.063 --> 06:49.793
No E. It's J-O-N-A-T-H-O-N, Jonathan Green, G-R-E-N.

06:49.773 --> 07:10.431
uh chasing the sun dictionary makers in the dictionary and it just came out about a month or so okay i'll call them since i do the fresh air things i can always get reviews yeah you should uh if you if you have trouble call me i mean they're my they're my publisher so i could order it but i i could ask them for a review and uh i could i'd be happy to have my publicist send you one too

07:10.411 --> 07:12.818
But you really should be alert to it.

07:12.838 --> 07:14.382
I'm interested always in books.

07:14.402 --> 07:16.127
And this guy's a Brit.

07:16.207 --> 07:20.520
He's England's leading lexicographer, they say, of just whatever.

07:21.462 --> 07:23.087
You could have fooled me.

07:23.472 --> 07:27.776
Hyperbole, thy name is a publicist, you know?

07:28.176 --> 07:53.378
No, the other thing I was going to say, I mean, the other thing that's very interesting in this domain is this guy's doing, with Silicon Graphics and the help from the Getty Foundation, they're making virtual reality representations of various buildings, like the Basilica di San Francisco and the Inesisi, or the Tomb of Nefertari in Egypt, which are buildings...

07:53.763 --> 08:01.445
Some of them, like the two of the other buildings you and I can't walk to anymore because our bodies change the humidity and whatever.

08:01.465 --> 08:06.439
So, you know, maybe you can, but I can't get, you know, you have to be somebody special to get in there.

08:06.841 --> 08:12.832
And they're also, I mean, in the virtual Vatican, for example, you can click at any point, you can see things, you can do things like that.

08:12.852 --> 08:15.136
That's amazing, yeah, the Sistine Chapel, for instance.

08:15.156 --> 08:17.240
You can see the Baldacchino from the top, right?

08:17.480 --> 08:21.968
And you can see the Sistine Chapel from... Yeah, and also things like the OED.

08:21.988 --> 08:23.891
The OED is never going to be published again.

08:23.952 --> 08:25.935
I mean, I sit here... It's crazy to publish that.

08:25.955 --> 08:28.680
...with an OED, and I love it, and it's physical...

08:28.660 --> 08:33.586
And then the other thing is this virtual reality is the virtual urbanism, right?

08:33.606 --> 08:37.670
I mean, you can restore the Rome as it was in 1400 and walk around it.

08:38.031 --> 08:40.353
There are things you cannot represent in any other way.

08:40.814 --> 08:50.365
And so the range of things, you know, how many are literary and how many are critical and how many have this reference function, but whatever, it remains.

08:51.121 --> 08:54.505
enormous range of things that are being produced and will be produced in these media.

08:54.525 --> 08:55.567
I mean, you know that.

08:55.587 --> 08:59.732
So tell me a little bit, because I do want to write a newspaper column here.

09:00.974 --> 09:03.057
We need a couple of live quotes on this book here.

09:03.377 --> 09:10.667
So tell me about the conference, and this is Umberto's, this is basically ACO's group, is that right?

09:10.807 --> 09:11.568
Well, no, no, no.

09:11.688 --> 09:19.238
ACO, this was a series of papers done at a conference center, or at a kind of university center, but it was a study center, let me know.

09:19.505 --> 09:22.944
that ACO has been instrumental in putting together.

09:24.874 --> 09:26.443
But these are people...

09:27.149 --> 09:28.932
from a wide variety of backgrounds.

09:29.873 --> 09:35.281
I really have to fault California for not putting a page of... Don't fault California.

09:35.321 --> 09:38.045
Fault me, and then I'll... Biographical flurbs.

09:38.065 --> 09:39.587
And Bray Pauls will fault Aiko.

09:40.428 --> 09:42.731
I would love to know who these people are.

09:42.972 --> 09:44.594
I'll tell you what the story was.

09:44.614 --> 09:51.644
This center has a relationship with this publisher called Bray Pauls, who are a Belgian Catholic publishing house.

09:51.945 --> 09:52.606
I've never heard of them.

09:52.626 --> 09:54.649
You've probably never heard of them, but actually $100 million a year company.

09:54.669 --> 09:57.072
But they do things like the Patrologia Latina and so on.

09:57.625 --> 10:00.938
And they have the right to do all the proceedings of the book, right?

10:01.541 --> 10:02.946
And they said, we'll do it, and so on.

10:02.967 --> 10:04.834
And then they gave it to an Italian

10:05.354 --> 10:09.058
little company to do the page whatever, and they kept screwing up.

10:09.399 --> 10:14.224
I got the first version of this, and all the hyphenation was done according to the Italian language.

10:14.244 --> 10:15.165
You have to have a vowel.

10:15.746 --> 10:18.269
To break a line, you just have to have a vowel on one each one.

10:18.869 --> 10:22.213
Before I forget, you said Joyce is Vassar.

10:22.233 --> 10:23.214
How about O'Donnell?

10:23.234 --> 10:25.277
O'Donnell is at the University of Pennsylvania.

10:25.297 --> 10:28.020
He's typical of the writers in this book.

10:28.680 --> 10:30.923
He's a classicist by training.

10:31.645 --> 10:37.212
who worked on Cassiothorus and Sirius and Augustine and so on.

10:38.554 --> 10:44.321
But for some reason, like a lot of classicists, has become very much interested in the new technology.

10:44.341 --> 10:45.863
Yeah, he'd be very good for me, I think.

10:46.003 --> 10:50.068
He's interesting, and he is now actually director of computer systems at the University of Pennsylvania.

10:50.168 --> 10:52.070
I'm giving a talk at Swarthmore next month.

10:52.131 --> 10:55.695
Oh, then you should just get in touch with him, because he's got a lot to say.

10:55.675 --> 11:04.867
And he, again, is somebody who spans the history of the book, I mean, whose interests go back to the manuscript period through the period of print and now through digital technology.

11:05.288 --> 11:07.070
Do you have a, you know what department he's in?

11:07.170 --> 11:09.994
He's now actually the, I'll give you his, I'll send you his email.

11:10.034 --> 11:11.616
I'm going to give you my email address.

11:11.636 --> 11:12.297
Yeah.

11:12.397 --> 11:20.108
It's N-A, November Alpha, Baz Baines, B-A-S, B-A-N-E-S, at AOL.

11:20.128 --> 11:20.248
Right.

11:21.072 --> 11:23.775
A-O-L dot com, yeah.

11:23.795 --> 11:27.338
Okay, I will N-A-Baz Banes, right, okay.

11:27.518 --> 11:28.439
B-A-N-E-S.

11:28.900 --> 11:30.201
Give me yours too.

11:30.221 --> 11:46.537
It's number, N-U-N-B-E-R-G, at park, P-A-R-C dot Xerox dot com.

11:47.778 --> 11:47.878
Okay.

11:48.679 --> 11:48.919
So,

11:49.405 --> 11:51.784
O'Donnell, a classicist.

11:51.805 --> 11:53.458
Bolter, also a classicist.

11:53.742 --> 11:54.483
Who's the other one?

11:54.523 --> 11:56.326
Carla Hesse is a historian.

11:56.366 --> 11:56.907
Oh, where is she?

11:57.288 --> 11:59.051
She's at the University of California, Berkeley.

11:59.712 --> 11:59.972
Damn it.

11:59.992 --> 12:01.194
I'm coming out again anyway.

12:01.535 --> 12:01.775
Right.

12:02.416 --> 12:03.578
She's very interesting as well.

12:03.598 --> 12:04.680
I mean, these are all people.

12:04.920 --> 12:05.922
I love the book, believe me.

12:06.543 --> 12:10.149
I think she's an interesting person to talk to.

12:10.189 --> 12:14.696
I mean, she's got a very... She edited a book on future libraries that UC Press did.

12:14.816 --> 12:15.217
I have it.

12:15.557 --> 12:15.878
Okay.

12:15.918 --> 12:18.783
It also comes out of this sort of rich culture.

12:18.883 --> 12:20.205
I mean, I think there's a sense in which...

12:20.877 --> 12:25.916
The people, on the one hand, the enthusiasts of the technology are really quite ignorant for the most part of the history.

12:26.820 --> 12:32.220
They invoke Gutenberg and so on, but in a kind of third-hand way.

12:32.875 --> 12:39.403
Well, I thought Sven Birkitz's book didn't help anybody.

12:39.523 --> 12:42.667
I mean, I didn't care for the book particularly.

12:42.687 --> 12:52.560
I mean, I thought it was kind of cranky and not very... I mean, if you know my book at all, people would think I'm diametrically opposed to this future stuff.

12:52.580 --> 12:53.481
I'm just not.

12:53.561 --> 12:56.605
I mean, nobody's more wired than me.

12:56.585 --> 12:58.147
No, I mean, I think we're all like that.

12:58.167 --> 13:01.791
I mean, at a certain point, I mean, you know, we're all saying, give me a break.

13:01.811 --> 13:04.194
I mean, you know, I don't have to make this choice.

13:04.234 --> 13:07.518
I mean, I'm sitting in a room full of books, right, and I'm sure you are, too.

13:08.479 --> 13:12.584
And, you know, we've also got three screens within four feet of me.

13:12.604 --> 13:16.909
You know, we've got three computers in the house, and I was thinking, everyone is essential.

13:17.269 --> 13:19.372
I mean, we're using them all at all times.

13:19.412 --> 13:26.440
I mean, you know, I want to be able to, I'm just doing that little, in that article of mine, which I'm not that happy with, but the...

13:26.420 --> 13:31.761
You know, the idea of being able to look in Jane Austen and say, how many times has Jane Austen used the word information and how does she use it?

13:32.443 --> 13:35.535
It's the kind of question that we couldn't have asked before the

13:36.089 --> 13:39.353
before the technology development.

13:39.373 --> 13:42.197
And it can even have a strong... It's a dissertation topic.

13:42.417 --> 13:43.378
Yeah, go into Shakespeare.

13:43.438 --> 13:47.663
How many times, because it was all language, go into Midsummer Night's Dream.

13:47.703 --> 13:49.926
How often does he use the word moon or moonshine?

13:49.946 --> 13:58.677
Right, now that was available always in the... That was, and then the... Laboriously compiled... Which I have, Spivex Concordance, which is... But you couldn't make those for all, right?

13:58.697 --> 14:03.463
I mean, again, for lexicography... That took him 25 years to do, though, just Shakespeare, I think it did.

14:03.443 --> 14:15.065
I have to tell you, when we were preparing new versions of the American Heritage Dictionary, the idea, you know, it used to be you had to have these huge files of citations, as with the OED, right?

14:15.566 --> 14:24.102
If I want to find, if I'm interested in a new word or a new use of a word, I can just go on to Dialogue or on to Nexus and just pull down, you know, a couple hundred cites.

14:24.554 --> 14:27.038
And it just makes sense enormously.

14:27.479 --> 14:30.443
You know, I see something new and I just grab it down off the way.

14:30.463 --> 14:34.489
Now, you're going to send me some stuff at AOL, right?

14:34.910 --> 14:35.631
Right.

14:35.912 --> 14:40.038
If you have anything on how I could reach O'Donnell and Joyce.

14:40.118 --> 14:40.298
Right.

14:40.318 --> 14:40.419
Okay.

14:40.439 --> 14:41.520
You want to reach O'Donnell?

14:41.821 --> 14:44.244
I'd be happy to reach Carla as well.

14:44.685 --> 14:45.246
Joyce.

14:46.306 --> 14:48.489
They really interest me, yeah.

14:48.509 --> 14:49.671
Anybody else?

14:49.691 --> 14:51.895
Well, Bolter is an interesting character.

14:51.935 --> 14:52.415
I'll send you him.

14:52.656 --> 14:53.717
He's also a classicist.

14:53.737 --> 14:56.081
He's at the center at the University of Georgia.

14:56.101 --> 14:57.323
Well, I love classicists.

14:57.363 --> 15:07.979
I just love the whole concept of... Well, my sense is that these guys, these guys tend to fetishize the object less than the rest of us do because their texts have always been, you know, at second hand and third hand.

15:07.999 --> 15:10.283
I mean, they never, you know, they never had the papyri and whatever.

15:10.343 --> 15:15.030
So their texts have already survived several transformations of...

15:15.803 --> 15:18.066
of technology.

15:18.126 --> 15:21.750
Give me a knockout quote that'll give me a lead for this newspaper piece.

15:21.790 --> 15:29.038
Well, I mean, let's say we're on the eve of a new millennium here, which is part of the subtitle of my new book.

15:30.380 --> 15:34.224
What do you say about books and book culture and the future of the book?

15:36.046 --> 15:38.049
A general quote.

15:38.129 --> 15:41.052
Well, I mean, one line I've used, I don't know, is that the future

15:41.909 --> 15:45.314
The future is always interesting... I'll give you this.

15:45.635 --> 15:53.988
The future is always interesting both for... What in anticipation is always most interesting about the future is how different it will be.

15:54.609 --> 16:00.178
And that's perhaps why people have focused on the new technologies of reading.

16:00.478 --> 16:05.967
In retrospect, what's no less interesting is just how much the future remains the same.

16:06.007 --> 16:07.950
And I think what will be most striking to us...

16:08.437 --> 16:14.302
in the middle of the 21st century is just how pervasive the printed book will remain.

16:14.382 --> 16:25.812
Perhaps not exactly in the form we're familiar with, perhaps distributed in other ways, perhaps advertised in other ways, but nonetheless, the 21st century may very well be the century of the book.

16:25.832 --> 16:28.114
That's fascinating.

16:28.214 --> 16:30.156
Do that again?

16:30.276 --> 16:31.136
You think so?

16:31.357 --> 16:37.802
What's most interesting about a writer like Wells is not just that he was able to predict a lot of the technological marbles of the

16:38.525 --> 16:52.222
of the 20th century, which, after all, any number of second-rate writers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries were able to do, but that he was able to envision them in a world in which men are still wearing bow ties.

16:52.943 --> 16:53.664
That's great.

16:54.224 --> 16:58.870
I have to tell you, I'd never heard of this Trithemius before, a fascinating character.

16:59.311 --> 17:01.093
I tried to get that book at the Athenaeum.

17:01.113 --> 17:05.158
They didn't have it, so I have to buy a new reading ticket at Harvard right now.

17:05.178 --> 17:06.760
I was hoping I could do this without buying a reading ticket.

17:06.740 --> 17:09.323
Donald has a web page.

17:09.483 --> 17:10.505
He does?

17:10.605 --> 17:12.127
Yeah, and he's got a lot of stuff.

17:12.147 --> 17:15.591
He's got indications of where a lot of the classical stuff could be found.

17:15.611 --> 17:16.733
So what, do I just punch up?

17:16.773 --> 17:18.715
Why don't you just do a search for O'Donnell?

17:19.256 --> 17:22.740
Yeah, if you do a search for James O'Donnell, it will come up.

17:22.920 --> 17:23.802
I will send you his email.

17:23.822 --> 17:25.283
I mean, I'll send you emails for all these people.

17:25.404 --> 17:25.864
Oh, great.

17:26.465 --> 17:28.107
But the...

17:28.407 --> 17:30.990
Also, it's a small corpus.

17:31.310 --> 17:36.757
All of the Greek stuff, all of the classical Greek stuff we have, you can get onto one or two CD-ROMs.

17:36.777 --> 17:41.242
It's not like the 19th century, which is endless, and there's all this ephemera.

17:41.262 --> 17:44.726
It's not like the Alexandrian Library exists in total.

17:44.746 --> 17:51.334
It's a small corpus, and so they can just put it onto CD-ROM, and they can have all of their corpus they can carry around in a brief while.

17:52.115 --> 17:54.938
So the class is, in a certain sense, way ahead of the rest of us.

17:55.390 --> 18:00.518
those who were steeped in these historical periods of the 19th centuries, all these folks.

18:00.538 --> 18:01.619
They're classists, they don't give a shit.

18:01.920 --> 18:05.926
Can you recommend any people at the MIT Media Lab, I should say?

18:05.966 --> 18:07.728
Well, I don't know the people there very well.

18:07.748 --> 18:12.876
I mean, Negroponte's the... He's the big guy, yeah.

18:13.582 --> 18:15.404
I'm trying to think if there's anybody else you really want to know.

18:15.424 --> 18:16.165
What's your interest?

18:16.525 --> 18:19.368
I'm just interested in learning, going over and seeing.

18:19.468 --> 18:20.189
I mean, I understand.

18:20.209 --> 18:23.172
There's a guy I think very highly of, who's very sensible about this.

18:23.192 --> 18:26.576
And I think if you want to know anything about digital libraries, he's the guy I would talk to.

18:27.116 --> 18:28.998
His name is Cliff Lynch, L-Y-N-C-H.

18:29.018 --> 18:30.079
I've heard his name before.

18:30.440 --> 18:33.082
And he's at the University of California Office of the President.

18:33.123 --> 18:35.085
I'll write him down and I'll send you his email.

18:35.105 --> 18:37.867
Okay, okay.

18:37.888 --> 18:41.111
And he does all the digital library material for them.

18:41.131 --> 18:43.133
But he's also very...

18:44.210 --> 18:49.726
Like a lot of people who are trained in libraries, he's not going to make the mistake of thinking that this is going to be simple.

18:50.408 --> 18:53.737
He understands how complicated it is and how important printed things are.

18:53.777 --> 18:57.949
He also understands some of the economic changes that are going on

18:58.722 --> 19:01.386
in distribution as we go towards digitization.

19:01.406 --> 19:04.631
The leading edge here is not in the kinds of books we've been talking about.

19:04.671 --> 19:05.933
It's in things like scientific journals.

19:06.294 --> 19:07.636
Which is what Stanford is doing.

19:07.776 --> 19:08.617
Which is what Stanford is doing.

19:08.637 --> 19:10.099
Have you talked to Vicki Reich there?

19:10.640 --> 19:13.745
Is she Mike's assistant?

19:13.965 --> 19:16.309
I did talk briefly with a woman there.

19:16.762 --> 19:20.508
They're the ones who are doing, I forget the name of the project they're doing.

19:20.528 --> 19:21.369
Yeah, I did talk to her.

19:21.810 --> 19:24.775
The digitizing, the... The scientific.

19:24.795 --> 19:25.476
The science, yeah.

19:25.797 --> 19:38.517
But it's also, I mean, there's a guy, the other person is a guy named Richard Lucier, L-U-C-I-E-R, who is at the UCSF, University of California, San Francisco Libraries, which is the medical school that corresponds to Berkeley.

19:39.188 --> 19:47.021
And they, I mean, Cliff Lynch will put you onto this stuff, but they are aggressively pursuing these various kinds of arrangements with the publishers.

19:47.121 --> 19:48.544
Because, I mean, nobody wants these.

19:48.944 --> 19:49.806
Lynch is at Berkeley?

19:50.106 --> 19:55.275
Lynch is at the University of California Office of the President, which is the office that handles these things for all of these.

19:55.295 --> 19:56.877
But that's located in Berkeley, right?

19:56.897 --> 19:58.019
They're located in Oakland, I think.

19:58.059 --> 19:58.600
They're in Oakland.

19:58.620 --> 20:02.727
But they, for all of the different, you know, UCLA and Berkeley and Davis.

20:02.747 --> 20:03.829
So they handle that for all the UCLA.

20:03.809 --> 20:05.492
But he's in the Office of the President.

20:05.712 --> 20:07.436
He's in the Office of the President.

20:07.736 --> 20:10.501
But he's also involved in these negotiations with publishers.

20:10.802 --> 20:12.625
He has a sense of how it's going to pan out.

20:13.066 --> 20:13.887
It's going to be very different.

20:13.908 --> 20:14.829
Now you'll subscribe.

20:16.132 --> 20:18.696
The negotiations will be handled at that level.

20:18.897 --> 20:25.108
Let's say if you want a journal that's digitally available from Elsevier,

20:25.780 --> 20:29.645
it will come, the negotiations will be between Elsevier and the University of California.

20:30.166 --> 20:32.488
And they'll sell just a license to the University of California.

20:32.709 --> 20:43.002
How do you feel about these colleges and universities, Fort Ord comes to mind, where they actually planned an institution without a library and the plans?

20:43.162 --> 20:44.644
Yeah, I think that's very dangerous.

20:44.664 --> 20:53.475
And I think one of the most dangerous things about all this talk, this Yammer, wired type Yammer, is that it encourages

20:54.029 --> 21:00.699
people to think that they can get away without physical libraries on the one hand and without subsidizing.

21:00.779 --> 21:09.372
I mean, the university presses are really suffering from this because in an age of shrinking university budgets, the presidents look around and say, where are we going to make cuts?

21:09.392 --> 21:10.775
Ooh, here's this university press.

21:10.875 --> 21:14.400
We're subsidizing them to the tune of 25 to 50 percent of their budget.

21:15.241 --> 21:16.543
Let's just get rid of that.

21:16.563 --> 21:17.544
And they'll go online.

21:17.564 --> 21:18.686
They'll figure out a way to do this.

21:19.767 --> 21:21.569
And those publishers are really suffering.

21:22.170 --> 21:24.073
And on the other hand, libraries.

21:24.113 --> 21:29.900
I mean, you know, a lot of people are, you know, for all there are these new library projects that you were mentioning.

21:29.980 --> 21:34.326
My sense is that universities are not spending a lot of money on libraries.

21:35.468 --> 21:37.410
And the assumption is, well, we don't need a new library.

21:37.450 --> 21:40.634
Now, I got some mail about this a while ago from somebody at a university.

21:40.654 --> 21:43.358
I believe the University of West Virginia, but don't quote me on that.

21:44.013 --> 21:46.477
where the president basically said, well, we don't want to spend money on the library.

21:46.497 --> 21:50.643
We won't need this in a little while.

21:50.683 --> 21:50.783
Jeez.

21:50.803 --> 21:50.883
UVA?

21:50.903 --> 21:51.744
You understand these guys.

21:51.784 --> 21:54.929
They're not attending to the budget pressures.

21:55.009 --> 21:58.715
They're desperate for ways to save money, and they don't get it.

21:58.915 --> 21:59.816
I won't quote you on this.

21:59.836 --> 22:00.457
Was this printed?

22:00.477 --> 22:01.559
Was this published?

22:01.579 --> 22:06.526
I got this... I mean, is there a source for this?

22:06.726 --> 22:09.210
No, I received a letter from...

22:10.203 --> 22:10.824
Oh, God.

22:10.924 --> 22:13.808
I probably have it in an email file somewhere.

22:13.828 --> 22:16.051
I received a letter from somebody at this university.

22:17.352 --> 22:19.035
Because I would just call the guy.

22:19.315 --> 22:29.489
I mean, in the way I... Well, it's also, I mean, there's that... If I can send you... Let me see, info about West Virginia.

22:33.794 --> 22:38.100
There was the Indiana story...

22:38.857 --> 22:41.281
The Indiana University, do you remember there was an IBM ad?

22:42.342 --> 22:42.763
No.

22:42.983 --> 22:46.408
That showed, there was one of these series of international IBM ads.

22:46.428 --> 22:48.792
You know, they show the two old... Oh, sure, sure.

22:48.812 --> 22:50.094
Yeah, the guy's getting everything.

22:50.895 --> 22:54.079
And there was one of an old... The old guy.

22:54.099 --> 22:55.341
He's from his vineyard in Italy.

22:55.782 --> 22:57.124
And he's doing his research.

22:57.224 --> 22:59.668
He's doing his PhD in the University of Indiana.

22:59.688 --> 23:01.610
They have their whole library online, right?

23:01.631 --> 23:02.211
Which is not true.

23:02.231 --> 23:04.695
Well, it turns out what Indiana actually has online...

23:04.675 --> 23:12.062
is some number of collect books, manuscripts from its music collection, period.

23:12.583 --> 23:20.571
And the idea that, I mean, and the ad really made it, did not make it, you know, evident that this was just some, and then the guy said, well, yeah, it's just a matter of scaling it up, right, which it isn't.

23:20.591 --> 23:29.360
I mean, as you know, there's a big difference between digitizing a small collection and digitizing, you know, Indiana probably has a million books in its library.

23:29.380 --> 23:30.401
It probably is more than that.

23:30.421 --> 23:33.484
So, I mean, it's only as big as Stanford.

23:33.953 --> 23:39.797
So there's a lot of this going on, and that again leads to the assumption that this is just a matter of time.

23:39.918 --> 23:42.428
Cliff Lynch is always railing about this assumption

23:43.673 --> 23:50.059
we can, you know, that it's just a matter of time, and all that stuff is almost available, and we really don't need libraries anymore, and so on.

23:50.079 --> 23:54.142
I mean, there's a lot of that going around, and it's very pernicious and annoying.

23:54.162 --> 23:55.504
And it doesn't help.

23:55.564 --> 23:58.106
It's very bad for public relations stuff, right?

23:58.126 --> 23:58.446
Right.

23:58.466 --> 24:00.448
Especially when you don't even call the place a library.

24:00.468 --> 24:03.091
They call it an information resources.

24:03.271 --> 24:03.391
Right.

24:03.411 --> 24:04.292
We have, you know, at J.S.

24:04.392 --> 24:07.374
Park, we have a technical information center, right, which we call it a technical.

24:07.394 --> 24:08.015
And I understand that.

24:08.035 --> 24:11.198
I mean, there, you know, these people, you know, we don't have that kind of resources.

24:11.218 --> 24:11.318
Yeah.

24:12.074 --> 24:16.444
Well, listen, I think it's diminishing returns after an hour.

24:16.645 --> 24:17.286
Yeah, okay.

24:17.306 --> 24:18.348
Well, listen, thanks a lot.

24:18.368 --> 24:20.092
But I'd like to talk to you again if it's okay.

24:20.894 --> 24:21.456
I will send you.

24:21.476 --> 24:23.220
Well, it was interesting to talk to you, so I got going on this.

24:23.360 --> 24:24.082
Oh, I appreciate it.

24:25.144 --> 24:30.336
I will send you this information, and with it will be my...

24:31.058 --> 24:32.781
full affiliation and address and so on.

24:32.801 --> 24:34.824
I hope you'll send me a copy of the piece when it appears.

24:34.985 --> 24:35.486
Absolutely.

24:35.506 --> 24:36.627
Well, why don't you give me an address?

24:37.449 --> 24:39.773
Well, what I'll do is I'll just put it on the... Oh, okay, good.

Okay.

24:39.953 --> 24:40.514
Good, good.

24:40.815 --> 24:44.721
Yeah, and it'll be pretty quick, so, you know, the next couple weeks, let's say.

24:44.982 --> 24:45.302
Okay.

24:45.422 --> 24:48.588
I'll look forward to seeing you, and good luck with this other thing, and I'll send you these addresses.

24:48.608 --> 24:49.369
