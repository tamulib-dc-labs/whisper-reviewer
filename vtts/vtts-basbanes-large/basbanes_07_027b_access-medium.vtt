00:03.305 --> 00:12.615
On side two, the Cinderella story of this indomitable, that's an interesting word, I-N-D-O-M-I-N-A-B-L-A, is that a correct word?

00:12.635 --> 00:15.318
Or is it, it should be indomitable, shouldn't it?

00:15.338 --> 00:19.042
Indomitable, irrepressible, sex world, right?

00:19.643 --> 00:28.052
Merry widow belly dancer, philanthropist, millionaires, iconosaur, dot, dot, dot, dot, four dots, all women.

00:28.072 --> 00:29.273
I don't think that's a good word.

00:29.293 --> 00:31.135
I don't know, it's not, it should be a T in there.

00:31.402 --> 00:35.628
Tula says, that indomitable is spelled I-N-D-O-M-I-N-A-B-L-E.

00:35.648 --> 00:36.929
It should be indomitable.

00:37.830 --> 00:42.416
Tula says, I wrote it because I aspire to inspire before I expire.

00:43.077 --> 00:49.165
And then it's signed, July 1975, with love to Dr. Roberts from Tula.

00:49.185 --> 00:51.969
And there are four photographs.

00:53.211 --> 00:53.992
You shouldn't put that on there.

00:54.012 --> 00:54.833
I won't put that on there.

00:54.853 --> 00:56.875
I won't put that on there, okay?

00:56.895 --> 00:57.857
This is wonderful.

00:58.437 --> 01:00.480
She and Ed Henry came down here.

01:01.557 --> 01:02.218
in between.

01:02.438 --> 01:05.783
We were developing it, but we won the rest of the stuff we had.

01:05.803 --> 01:05.943
Jeez.

01:06.184 --> 01:07.105
But look at the picture.

01:07.145 --> 01:13.795
They came down here, and she was made, she, no, she was made an honorary member of 580 Kappa.

01:14.456 --> 01:17.721
She was made?

01:17.741 --> 01:20.265
And we had a dinner, I think.

01:20.285 --> 01:21.026
Isn't this wonderful?

01:21.046 --> 01:24.671
She went to the logical group of faculty wives, which my wife had done this time.

01:24.691 --> 01:29.378
I tell you, I was one of the funniest goddamn reports that I ever heard of my wife.

01:29.398 --> 01:30.079
I didn't know that.

01:30.177 --> 01:38.147
Well, there are four pictures of Tula here, one sitting in front of a really impressive... Well, that looks like a couple of Picassos, doesn't it, huh?

01:38.167 --> 01:38.267
What?

01:38.287 --> 01:40.070
I said, the paintings here are unbelievable.

01:40.090 --> 01:41.131
Oh, my God.

01:41.211 --> 01:42.613
She's got those paintings behind her.

01:42.633 --> 01:44.035
Yeah, look at those paintings.

01:44.275 --> 01:44.575
Right.

01:44.836 --> 01:45.176
Yeah.

01:45.296 --> 01:45.637
Yeah.

01:45.897 --> 01:46.978
And, of course, an inset.

01:47.119 --> 01:50.883
There she is as a belly dancer with a massive bust.

01:51.244 --> 01:53.827
And here she is lying on her back in costume.

01:54.108 --> 01:56.050
You can't recognize who they are except that one.

01:56.130 --> 01:57.552
Well, that's pretty obvious, yeah.

01:59.050 --> 02:02.815
Oh, yeah, the whole house was walled and covered with things.

02:02.855 --> 02:03.736
Yeah.

02:03.756 --> 02:05.638
That's great.

02:05.779 --> 02:08.702
Thanks for showing it to me.

02:08.903 --> 02:10.865
That's because you're going to send me that.

02:10.885 --> 02:12.948
I'm going to send you lots of stuff, and I'll do it.

02:15.451 --> 02:19.576
And the title of this book, The Strange Triangle of GBS.

02:19.737 --> 02:21.939
She wrote this, which we just crashed.

02:22.260 --> 02:22.841
She wrote this?

02:22.921 --> 02:23.061
Yeah.

02:23.081 --> 02:24.082
How did she know about it?

02:24.102 --> 02:25.424
Did she pretend to be a scholar?

02:25.604 --> 02:27.006
Oh, yeah, she pretended to be.

02:27.086 --> 02:27.927
She published it.

02:28.852 --> 02:31.035
Bruce Humphreys, 1956.

02:32.497 --> 02:34.299
I would say it's privately published.

02:34.419 --> 02:36.342
It's a fancy press stuff, yeah.

02:36.963 --> 02:38.525
In fact, look at the picture of her in the back.

02:39.245 --> 02:40.687
Was he much older than her?

02:40.747 --> 02:42.309
Much.

02:42.510 --> 02:48.177
Would you say that she was as much of an acquisition as the paintings and the manuscripts for him?

02:48.217 --> 02:48.958
She said she was.

02:49.279 --> 02:50.961
She said she was.

02:52.923 --> 02:55.286
Does she have anything to do with the purchase of the stuff?

02:55.306 --> 02:56.568
I don't know.

02:56.588 --> 02:57.349
That's my notebook.

02:57.369 --> 02:58.150
I think so.

02:59.294 --> 03:00.936
Tell me when you want me to go, by the way.

03:00.976 --> 03:05.021
That's all right.

03:05.041 --> 03:09.447
I'll take my wife off a little ride this afternoon, enjoy a little Texas before we go home tomorrow.

03:09.467 --> 03:10.007
Oh, good.

03:10.027 --> 03:10.448
We'll do that.

03:10.468 --> 03:11.349
Drive out west.

03:11.709 --> 03:12.931
The hill country is lovely.

03:13.071 --> 03:15.054
Is that right?

03:15.074 --> 03:15.434
That's nice place.

03:15.454 --> 03:24.285
And that's where Austin's expanding in that direction, where all the new money is, those big houses.

03:24.305 --> 03:26.668
This is where the old money is except us.

03:27.188 --> 03:29.311
Let's talk just a bit about the future.

03:29.731 --> 03:31.974
It's not static.

03:31.994 --> 03:34.718
The 20th century has two decades to go.

03:35.539 --> 03:36.300
Well, yes.

03:36.360 --> 03:43.409
What I think they need to do is to continue buying materials as a supplement, what they have.

03:44.150 --> 03:49.197
I really think they ought to try to concentrate and complete the 20th century.

03:50.639 --> 03:52.661
And then it will be a great monument, won't it?

03:52.801 --> 03:53.823
Yeah.

03:53.843 --> 03:54.784
We had programs.

03:54.984 --> 03:57.027
We set up a buying program.

03:57.428 --> 04:11.704
which I think, immediately after I retired, and it was not continued, in which we had a certain number of writers, and we had arrangements of booksellers to send us their first editions as soon as they were published.

04:11.724 --> 04:17.671
And every book that was published in there, some of them got them and published their prices.

04:18.652 --> 04:25.680
And that arrangement with Andrews Graham, for example, he had a big cardboard box,

04:26.048 --> 04:30.874
And every time he got a little magazine or a little odd pamphlet or something like that, he'd throw one up over there.

04:31.555 --> 04:33.637
And then when he'd get full, he'd buy it from him.

04:34.478 --> 04:35.840
Tom has a short list.

04:35.860 --> 04:36.661
It's not so short.

04:36.681 --> 04:41.186
A list of 500 or 800 odd authors that they're buying regularly.

04:41.707 --> 04:43.268
Is this something that you people started?

04:43.288 --> 04:44.350
Yeah, I started a long time ago.

04:44.390 --> 04:45.851
And I said, can I have a copy of that?

04:45.871 --> 04:46.472
And he smiled.

04:46.492 --> 04:46.953
He said, no.

04:46.973 --> 04:49.896
He said, every rare book dealer in America would like a copy of this list.

04:49.916 --> 04:50.537
And he's right.

04:50.804 --> 04:52.246
Well, it's me left.

04:52.266 --> 04:54.208
I wonder, you know, can you have some bookseller helping you?

04:54.288 --> 04:56.110
You know, I think it's awfully hard to do it yourself.

04:56.530 --> 05:01.456
You know, what it was was a big computer printout, and they had the numbers, you know, which was very interesting.

05:01.476 --> 05:02.497
Yeah, it was good.

05:02.517 --> 05:05.320
They got all kinds of computers, you see.

05:05.560 --> 05:14.249
For years, I tried to get a grant to put all of George Marshall's letters on the computer, annotated.

05:14.269 --> 05:17.152
But in that day, the computer was big, you know, and it was hard.

05:18.654 --> 05:19.495
Well, I never got the money.

05:20.099 --> 05:23.662
But nowadays, they've got that place full of little Matt Crosse's on their right mind.

05:24.463 --> 05:27.946
I talked to a pleasant young woman.

05:28.086 --> 05:30.648
I think Kathy Bigger was on.

05:30.889 --> 05:32.530
No, Bigger.

05:32.570 --> 05:33.311
Bigger, yeah.

05:33.411 --> 05:34.192
Yeah, you're right.

05:34.332 --> 05:35.813
But she's doing all her computer stuff.

05:36.494 --> 05:37.655
And that's interesting.

05:37.695 --> 05:38.776
So they're getting there.

05:38.796 --> 05:39.757
It's going to take time.

05:39.837 --> 05:40.257
Oh, it is.

05:40.377 --> 05:40.938
Oh, yeah.

05:40.958 --> 05:42.579
They're putting everything on computer now.

05:42.599 --> 05:43.880
I've got a modem over here.

05:44.120 --> 05:48.044
I can call out the library and I can look at everything I want to.

05:48.364 --> 05:49.245
It's in that computer.

05:50.052 --> 06:16.718
One of the raps on Texas in the early days, and again, was that one of the raps, the criticisms, was that they bought, quote, indiscriminately, that the tower was filled with things they didn't even know was in there.

06:17.018 --> 06:19.121
Is that a Justify or a Justify?

06:19.241 --> 06:27.253
Well, for a time we had, we were buying things and they were stored almost everywhere.

06:27.333 --> 06:32.320
And then we got a big building out there.

06:32.340 --> 06:33.942
And then finally got this new building.

06:35.004 --> 06:41.533
Most of the actual manuscript material and the extremely valuable books were kept in the main building.

06:41.553 --> 06:41.874
Tower?

06:42.054 --> 06:42.735
Yeah.

06:42.755 --> 06:46.080
No, the old Rare Books Library used to be

06:47.410 --> 06:51.194
It's located where the president's office is now, which is on the fourth floor of the main building.

06:51.214 --> 06:52.796
That's the tower building.

06:52.816 --> 06:56.199
But the fourth floor is on the front, looking down toward the capitol.

06:56.800 --> 06:57.381
That's where it was.

06:57.421 --> 07:02.586
That whole top floor there was the dump of all the rebels.

07:02.606 --> 07:12.837
And it was run by a lady that entered Fanny Radford for years, who, I suppose, didn't remember Thomas A. Wise.

07:14.078 --> 07:15.660
He's part of my book.

07:15.680 --> 07:15.780
Good.

07:16.874 --> 07:31.557
Well, she wrote a book about wise forgeries in existence, which are valuable now in the original, because they're forging the forgeries sometimes.

07:31.577 --> 07:37.225
There's quite a little controversy, because Carter really wanted to see some of those letters, and Texans wouldn't look at it.

07:37.265 --> 07:38.868
Forsheimer wouldn't look at it.

07:38.888 --> 07:42.173
I guess Forsheimer had some letters that came afterwards.

07:42.659 --> 07:43.961
that ultimately came here.

07:44.021 --> 07:46.745
And this woman actually did a little monograph, I think.

07:47.526 --> 07:49.208
She did the book, but there was a monograph.

07:49.409 --> 07:50.090
I have the book.

07:50.110 --> 07:51.151
You don't have to do it.

07:51.171 --> 07:51.692
I have the book.

07:51.712 --> 07:54.857
Yeah, what she did was very firmly on with Edmund Goss.

07:54.937 --> 07:55.538
That's right.

07:55.558 --> 08:00.785
Collaborated in the House of Lords, which the British always hated it for, but she was quite spotty.

08:01.106 --> 08:04.170
Very much of a steel magnolia.

08:06.433 --> 08:08.937
But anyway, to go back on track there about

08:09.440 --> 08:13.725
the so-called, the alleged purported indiscriminate people.

08:13.745 --> 08:14.426
Oh, yeah, yeah.

08:14.446 --> 08:16.888
But actually, it wasn't really indiscriminate.

08:17.069 --> 08:19.271
Divine wasn't indiscriminate.

08:19.291 --> 08:20.713
It was just coming in front of me.

08:20.733 --> 08:25.858
Some of the things used to horrify me, and I told a question, much as possible, like we had a fire once in the tower.

08:27.100 --> 08:34.788
And when I first came down, I wanted to see one of his tapes, and then we found out, and I had to tell him.

08:34.808 --> 08:35.329
I'm sorry.

08:37.688 --> 08:40.531
I bet he didn't pull his stuff out, though, either.

08:40.551 --> 08:41.853
Oh, no, he didn't.

08:41.933 --> 08:42.634
He was a good one.

08:46.057 --> 08:47.499
So, the answer to that is no.

08:48.760 --> 08:55.288
You had a window... The buying wasn't indiscriminate, and we had them pretty well cared for.

08:55.328 --> 08:59.172
That is really part of the jealousy of the whole thing, really.

08:59.873 --> 09:03.197
I thought you were going to talk about raps like government interference with a university.

09:03.217 --> 09:04.438
We've had that kind of thing.

09:05.144 --> 09:09.290
And that's what you say as well?

09:09.330 --> 09:18.083
Well, no, I wouldn't say it's always groundless, but I wouldn't say it's always hard as much.

09:18.103 --> 09:20.146
Is there anything I haven't covered?

09:20.186 --> 09:23.271
Well, you do know the old history, don't you?

09:23.952 --> 09:24.913
We have the one library.

09:24.973 --> 09:25.694
That's right.

09:26.015 --> 09:26.836
In 1918, I think.

09:26.876 --> 09:28.138
Yeah, who bought it?

09:28.178 --> 09:30.261
Major Newfield.

09:30.421 --> 09:30.662
Right.

09:32.384 --> 09:32.645
Right.

09:34.367 --> 09:34.948
C.S.A.

09:36.262 --> 09:43.210
He had a little house down there on the corner.

09:43.230 --> 09:50.920
Yeah, that house, all that iron work they found, selling cows and running back.

09:52.301 --> 09:54.664
He gave a lot of money.

09:54.684 --> 09:56.086
He did some nice things.

09:56.126 --> 09:59.710
Yeah, he did a lot of things.

09:59.730 --> 10:01.172
There were two men.

10:01.372 --> 10:02.594
We did a lot at the University.

10:02.655 --> 10:07.304
One of them was George W. Bracken, who was one of those major—Livingville, I think.

10:09.408 --> 10:14.799
Littlefield was an officer in the Confederate Army, and Bracken was just an officer in the Indian Army, and they were extremely jealous of each other.

10:15.761 --> 10:18.807
And each one wanted to do more for the University than the other one.

10:19.867 --> 10:21.449
About when is this now?

10:21.810 --> 10:23.372
Must be the early part of the 70s.

10:23.393 --> 10:25.836
70s, 80s, and last year.

10:26.097 --> 10:30.023
Well, they've always founded the 70s, 80s, 90s, and the first decade of the century.

10:30.203 --> 10:31.986
Yeah, quite a long time ago.

10:32.006 --> 10:34.049
Brackenridge left him a lot of land out here.

10:34.069 --> 10:35.331
It's called Brackenridge right now.

10:36.613 --> 10:48.051
And he wanted him to move the university out there, which they really shouldn't have done, because, you know, they're not paying much money now through the teeth to get even the houses over around East Austin.

10:49.010 --> 11:00.248
And Littlefield gave them that library and all this money and everything else but fun for Southern history, on the proviso that if they ever moved the university, it all went back.

11:00.309 --> 11:03.033
He didn't want to move that and bring them back to the property.

11:05.998 --> 11:07.821
Absolutely marvelous situation here.

11:07.881 --> 11:10.445
I don't know whether they could break that or not.

11:11.347 --> 11:14.612
Nobody would pay much attention to it.

11:17.005 --> 11:18.807
Well, they can hardly move now.

11:18.847 --> 11:24.212
They can hardly move now unless somebody raises the price of oil considerably.

11:25.053 --> 11:30.879
So, you're justly proud of your... Yeah.

11:31.019 --> 11:37.166
You are justly proud, I would hope, I would imagine, of your association over the years with the agency.

11:37.186 --> 11:38.407
Oh, absolutely.

11:38.427 --> 11:39.968
It would have been difficult to find a job.

11:41.490 --> 11:44.413
Everyone would want more, I think.

11:45.794 --> 11:57.591
Another rap, and I don't know if it's much of a rap, but that in the purchases you wound up with 40-odd copies of Ulysses, first editions.

11:57.611 --> 11:58.533
A lot more than that.

11:58.933 --> 12:00.295
We bought everyone we could find.

12:00.315 --> 12:02.418
No, was that intentional?

12:02.559 --> 12:05.824
Yeah, it was intentional.

12:05.844 --> 12:06.565
More than 40?

12:06.705 --> 12:08.207
What are they doing with the Shakespeare movies?

12:08.474 --> 12:11.760
What do they do with them?

12:11.780 --> 12:13.943
Well, they collate them to get the perfect copy.

12:13.963 --> 12:14.444
Exactly.

12:14.725 --> 12:15.987
What are they going to do with Ulysses?

12:17.850 --> 12:18.591
They're still doing it.

12:18.651 --> 12:19.933
They haven't finished it yet.

12:20.034 --> 12:22.237
They're doing it here?

12:22.378 --> 12:22.658
No.

12:22.678 --> 12:24.681
I'll have to come here to do part of it.

12:25.723 --> 12:30.812
But that was the notion that Ulysses was an important book, which I said, and that they're going to work on it.

12:30.852 --> 12:31.353
And they have.

12:31.373 --> 12:33.857
As a matter of fact, the professor here wrote a critique of that.

12:35.761 --> 12:37.964
There was supposed to be a critical edition of it.

12:37.984 --> 12:38.965
I've forgotten.

12:38.985 --> 12:40.167
I'm a little out of touch.

12:40.187 --> 12:42.030
Oh, there was, but it's already been discredited.

12:42.090 --> 12:42.690
Yeah, that's right.

12:42.711 --> 12:45.054
Well, the professor here wrote about discredited.

12:45.454 --> 12:46.756
Okay, that's been discredited.

12:46.816 --> 12:49.860
And so were most of his large things working on that, too, I imagine.

12:50.541 --> 12:56.630
But that was the theory that we have these, and you have all of them, yeah.

12:56.670 --> 12:59.153
And there are all kinds of differences in that, you see.

12:59.588 --> 13:01.331
They kept changing it.

13:01.351 --> 13:05.357
Well, there were 500 errata, I think, in the first printing.

13:05.537 --> 13:11.246
Plus, it was being done by French compositors who couldn't read anything.

13:11.386 --> 13:14.131
People who couldn't come out and couldn't read anything.

13:14.211 --> 13:15.933
And so you have quite a few lady chattels.

13:15.953 --> 13:19.419
That was done, not too many.

13:19.439 --> 13:24.186
18 or something, I don't know.

13:24.286 --> 13:27.351
I'll tell them they could try mine if they wanted to.

13:27.483 --> 13:30.107
And there's no reason why they shouldn't, so some of those now.

13:30.508 --> 13:37.659
However, we do have multiple copies of most of Lawrence's books, like 14 of some.

13:37.679 --> 13:41.385
But, you know, examine all of those when I do the bibliography.

13:41.405 --> 13:42.907
And you have to see all those books.

13:43.127 --> 13:46.673
You really ought to see every one in existence.

13:47.362 --> 13:51.546
if you're going to write a bibliography, if you're really going to describe what happens to it in the process of painting.

13:51.606 --> 13:53.608
And you're speaking as a bibliographer now.

13:54.089 --> 13:54.629
Yeah.

13:54.649 --> 13:56.151
So you're speaking with some authority.

13:56.191 --> 13:56.812
Yeah.

13:56.872 --> 13:59.234
Well, you see, you have to see those.

13:59.534 --> 14:04.379
And they've been immensely valuable.

14:04.399 --> 14:05.901
They have multiple copies of books.

14:06.121 --> 14:09.624
I mean, that is a deliberate thing.

14:09.665 --> 14:15.090
In other words, you don't have to do it with some sense of balance, however.

14:15.391 --> 14:18.114
25 copies of every book published in the 20th century.

14:18.995 --> 14:25.982
But some of the more important books, the more important writers, it may be potentially important.

14:26.042 --> 14:30.387
Would it be worth my while to talk to Deckard Turner, I think, if I can find him?

14:31.288 --> 14:33.690
He's kind of been recluse with me now.

14:33.750 --> 14:34.551
I don't know.

14:34.591 --> 14:35.532
You might talk to him.

14:35.632 --> 14:36.113
I don't know.

14:36.133 --> 14:37.895
I suppose I kind of am sorry for the man.

14:42.119 --> 14:44.622
He's a little unstable, I think.

14:44.770 --> 14:51.459
They asked me when he got the job, and as far as I knew, he was fine.

14:52.201 --> 15:03.376
He had charge of the Golden Club visit here, and I collaborated with him and talked with him about that, and we made arrangements.

15:03.497 --> 15:04.598
I thought he was very good.

15:04.638 --> 15:13.731
He was at the Broadway Library at SMU, which has a very good collection of cannabia, which is mostly religiously, or a lot of it is, but

15:14.420 --> 15:18.685
He likes all the books, but he likes museum books, the Vikings and things.

15:19.766 --> 15:23.009
And I don't think he's really a scholar in that sense.

15:23.950 --> 15:28.135
And he had a very slight regard for 20th century material.

15:28.155 --> 15:32.920
Isn't he the one who coined the phrase, the Ransom Syndrome?

15:32.940 --> 15:33.480
I don't know.

15:34.241 --> 15:36.784
But he did, he did a phrase.

15:36.824 --> 15:39.567
He did some very, very silly things.

15:40.188 --> 15:43.453
I mean, he... He even wrote about them on his HRC notes.

15:43.573 --> 15:43.894
Oh, I know.

15:43.914 --> 15:45.656
That was the silliest thing on earth.

15:46.097 --> 15:55.150
You don't know how for 25 years I struggled to keep this place from appearing like a foolish place in the press.

15:55.170 --> 16:01.820
I mean, there was a screen between Ransom and everybody else in the public.

16:02.421 --> 16:06.307
And that guy came out in that press room.

16:06.327 --> 16:08.490
You know, he said...

16:10.006 --> 16:16.612
I know a man who had the biggest Ted Hughes collection in existence, and he wrote about it today.

16:17.473 --> 16:22.197
And he came and tried to sell it to Decker.

16:22.217 --> 16:24.879
And Decker just threw it on his ear.

16:25.640 --> 16:38.832
And he wrote one of his things about it, about how this man came in and said, I'm going to get married, and I need to buy a house, and you can have this collection for all the... So he embarrassed him.

16:39.790 --> 16:45.158
embarrassed everybody, and Ted Hughes became the boy lawyer.

16:45.178 --> 16:45.458
You know.

16:45.979 --> 16:49.985
I mean, it would have been a perfect thing to add to this.

16:51.647 --> 16:52.389
Isn't that something?

16:52.549 --> 16:52.829
You see?

16:53.330 --> 17:00.641
So, he abruptly cut off and insulted almost all of them.

17:01.943 --> 17:04.747
And, I don't know, you can't do this without both people.

17:04.767 --> 17:07.671
I mean, Brother Miller, for example, none of

17:08.377 --> 17:14.863
I mean, that doesn't mean you have to think they're God and do everything they say, but you have to work through those people.

17:14.943 --> 17:22.630
They know things and find things, particularly if you're adding chunks.

17:23.051 --> 17:24.832
Were you kind of the chief scout?

17:25.052 --> 17:27.795
Were you kind of the chief scout for things?

17:27.875 --> 17:29.557
Well, I don't want to partially say that.

17:30.998 --> 17:36.443
Did you kind of suggest to Dr. Ransom areas that you made your...

17:36.946 --> 17:38.548
probes that you had located?

17:38.568 --> 17:39.009
Oh, yeah.

17:39.409 --> 17:43.074
Usually, I'd just let Luke Alvin pay for it.

17:45.137 --> 17:46.199
And say it's there, right?

17:46.839 --> 17:46.980
Yeah.

17:47.040 --> 17:48.882
But you would indicate to Lou that you'd like it.

17:49.283 --> 17:49.603
Oh, yeah.

17:49.623 --> 17:50.805
Lou would buy it, and then, sure.

17:50.825 --> 17:52.247
And then what, he'd deal with ransom?

17:52.868 --> 17:53.528
Well, yeah.

17:53.548 --> 18:00.097
Well, a lot of times, too, I just, I got the stuff and had him send it here and just had Lou pay for it, you know.

18:00.117 --> 18:00.718
He didn't know.

18:00.738 --> 18:01.960
He just paid for it in short as 10%.

18:01.980 --> 18:02.981
Isn't that wonderful?

18:03.001 --> 18:03.242
Yeah.

18:03.262 --> 18:04.303
Oh, it was very useful.

18:04.638 --> 18:08.564
I'm going to send you a few things that I've written to give you an idea.

18:08.584 --> 18:09.365
Normally I do that.

18:09.385 --> 18:13.852
I write you a letter, but I just called you this week, and so it was kind of put together rather hastily.

18:14.372 --> 18:19.120
But I will send you a copy of Tom's... Tom's machine works.

18:19.140 --> 18:21.723
And a few other things, and we'll keep in touch.

18:21.743 --> 18:25.269
And if you don't mind, I'll call you if I have any other questions.

18:25.289 --> 18:27.652
And you mentioned that you'd inscribe this for me.

18:28.093 --> 18:28.273
Oh.

18:28.774 --> 18:30.296
That would be awfully nice if you did that.

18:31.197 --> 18:32.940
I'm going to shut off the machine now, okay?

18:34.253 --> 18:35.935
Dr. Robert's a collector here.

18:36.616 --> 18:40.561
Anyway, I bought him a bookshop in Santa Fe.

18:40.581 --> 18:41.562
I don't know, maybe.

18:41.582 --> 18:43.224
$10 or something.

18:43.244 --> 18:50.554
$5 was coming.

18:53.017 --> 18:54.619
And I showed it to Dobie.

18:55.340 --> 18:56.862
He recognized his name.

18:58.003 --> 18:59.064
Isn't that something?

18:59.084 --> 19:00.426
He'd given it to her.

19:00.446 --> 19:01.948
So he wrote,

19:03.835 --> 19:06.399
Look at that!

19:06.539 --> 19:10.865
So this is now to you?

19:11.146 --> 19:12.287
Yeah, that's right.

19:12.307 --> 19:28.912
On the title, on the dedication page, dear, and I won't read the whole thing, but it's a very long... The past sometimes adds to the interest of a copy of a book, and he knew that woman, and he said, I'll tell you about this, have to part with a book that you love.

19:30.234 --> 19:31.976
So does he talk about this book?

19:32.958 --> 19:33.218
Yeah.

19:33.552 --> 19:35.014
He said that.

19:35.034 --> 19:38.377
This first edition is that of Ruth Waltham Barber.

19:38.397 --> 19:39.398
Being arcade, yeah.

19:39.418 --> 19:43.262
In the back of the frontiers, the very delightful Cavalleros, especially delighted.

19:44.784 --> 19:46.986
Delightful on Burroughs came out in 1931.

19:47.147 --> 19:47.267
Yeah.

19:47.887 --> 19:49.669
According to the children, it was published, though.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.952
It was copyrighted in 1930.

19:52.012 --> 19:54.575
I came to know her at Ruth Cavalleros.

19:54.775 --> 19:56.036
I liked her very much.

19:56.136 --> 19:59.220
When it was republished, her name was shortened to Ruth Waltham.

19:59.240 --> 19:59.981
I was curious.

20:00.481 --> 20:01.382
L-U-G-H-L-A-N, right.

20:01.683 --> 20:04.688
Yeah, you got her a copy of Carnot's children.

20:04.708 --> 20:08.093
Now I know you found it in Santa Fe, where she lives.

20:08.113 --> 20:15.344
So, as neighbor to the boroughs out there, good people, let's go back and find her.

20:15.364 --> 20:29.665
It's not too bad to die, but to become indifferent to a book once cherished, or to need a little money is too bad.

20:29.864 --> 20:31.146
Yeah.

20:31.166 --> 20:31.907
When did he sign?

20:31.947 --> 20:33.930
Did he date that by the way?

20:33.950 --> 20:34.230
1963.

20:35.672 --> 20:36.353
That's wonderful.

20:38.716 --> 20:43.063
That's, you know, this book has a whole new life.

20:43.083 --> 20:44.565
Austin, 15 October 1963.

20:44.665 --> 20:46.908
Isn't that wonderful?

20:47.649 --> 20:48.991
That's quite interesting.

20:49.371 --> 20:50.533
I'm keeping all of this stuff.

20:50.553 --> 20:51.655
I'm keeping all of this stuff.

20:51.675 --> 20:57.182
And sometimes I'm fixing things.

20:57.202 --> 20:57.643
This or that.

20:58.552 --> 21:05.502
a distant relative to mine, the wife of this guy who was a ranger.

21:05.642 --> 21:10.448
A woman's reminiscences of six years in camp with the picture.

21:10.468 --> 21:14.794
She stayed with me in camp, a place where I was born and raised, actually.

21:14.814 --> 21:15.315
Where is that?

21:15.655 --> 21:17.338
Oh, about 130 miles west of the area.

21:18.059 --> 21:21.323
And I think this is the picture of the picture.

21:21.343 --> 21:21.804
And this is D.W.

21:21.824 --> 21:22.204
Roberts.

21:22.325 --> 21:27.732
And this is her account of it, of all the experience that I had.

21:28.133 --> 21:34.120
But anyway, this is a kind of thing I'm putting together in people.

21:34.140 --> 21:37.204
I'm very proud, and one of my cases one.

21:37.224 --> 21:39.547
So, that's great.

21:40.709 --> 21:42.711
Yeah, I'm doing great.

21:42.771 --> 21:51.482
Tom Lee is another one of the man that has a marvelous... He's a painter and writer.

21:51.502 --> 21:52.643
You see the Tom Lee collection?

21:53.224 --> 21:56.688
You didn't see his paintings, you know.

21:56.708 --> 21:57.229
But that's okay.

21:57.631 --> 22:03.021
Were you a collector before you became an educator?

22:03.322 --> 22:05.085
Well, not much.

22:07.971 --> 22:11.658
This is something that developed in— I've got to show you, Tom Lee.

22:11.698 --> 22:16.247
This is all at Texas Workplace on the location.

22:16.267 --> 22:17.249
But I have to show you that book that comes down.

22:17.269 --> 22:17.990
I never can find anything.

22:18.010 --> 22:20.635
There are two copies of that book that comes down.

22:25.137 --> 22:26.078
This is awfully nice.

22:26.199 --> 22:28.883
You've got to go, yeah, you've got to go ask your wife soon.

22:28.903 --> 22:31.928
Oh, yeah, I told you that one, but it's dirty, but that's not, that's on my own track.

22:33.330 --> 22:34.692
Oh, here it is.

22:34.712 --> 22:36.074
No, this is Battle Stations.

22:36.094 --> 22:38.598
He was a combat artist.

22:39.520 --> 22:41.703
Oh, that's kind of interesting.

22:41.723 --> 22:42.464
Yeah, it is nice.

22:42.504 --> 22:47.592
This is a, you know, of his, uh, he did a lot of paintings over there.

22:47.613 --> 22:48.193
World War II?

22:48.374 --> 22:49.215
Yeah, World War II.

22:49.696 --> 22:53.001
This, uh, in Gorda Canal, uh, campaign.

22:53.234 --> 22:55.897
Tom Lee, L.E.A., as I was calling that.

22:55.917 --> 22:58.859
But his Western painting was a great song.

22:59.420 --> 23:06.527
He did this History of the King Ranch.

23:06.547 --> 23:10.511
Kathleen did a book of his paintings.

23:10.531 --> 23:12.813
She was really nice.

23:12.833 --> 23:14.494
Kathleen's a wonderful show.

23:14.514 --> 23:14.875
She's really nice.

23:15.575 --> 23:17.057
She was so pleased when I knew her book.

23:17.778 --> 23:19.079
She was really nice.

23:19.139 --> 23:19.719
Which book was it?

23:19.739 --> 23:20.660
The Beverly Gifted one?

23:20.840 --> 23:21.541
Oh, yeah.

23:21.561 --> 23:22.482
Isn't that nice?

23:23.913 --> 23:26.238
In fact, I'm going to send it to her and ask her to describe it for me.

23:26.258 --> 23:28.843
In fact, I wrote about it.

23:28.863 --> 23:36.538
I did a review of it.
