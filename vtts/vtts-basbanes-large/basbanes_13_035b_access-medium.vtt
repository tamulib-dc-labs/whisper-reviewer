00:03.068 --> 00:13.357
When it comes to reading, to portray their reading methods, I should write at the beginning, read the book from the very start.

00:13.377 --> 00:23.425
I was going to leave in the middle of the second hand, and I could go on with this book, and I was going to very faithfully carry on to the end.

00:23.445 --> 00:28.690
About seven years ago, I started this book called The Israel Reading.

00:31.032 --> 00:32.653
It started as a little essay.

00:33.022 --> 00:37.429
There seemed to be several views that met there.

00:37.530 --> 00:57.223
And with the question, I was very intrigued as to why the history of what I love, the history of literature, had always been written from the point of view of the writers, when in fact, it seemed to me, it was the readers who decided what a book is going to be.

00:57.490 --> 01:09.705
Jonathan Swift adamantly thought that his book was fierce political satire, and I believe the readers put the book on the shelf of children's books.

01:12.528 --> 01:20.638
The powers of the reader, I think, have not been chronicled in any systematic way.

01:21.779 --> 01:25.624
And when I worked on this book, I realized why.

01:26.110 --> 01:40.534
Probably because to write even a history of reading, a big history of reading, as I first arrogantly thought I would be able to do, is to write the history of the world.

01:43.219 --> 01:48.928
It's an extremely complex activity and I found that

01:49.432 --> 02:04.622
To describing the chronology of literature, the usual chronology of what we call history is quite useful because things happen in a different order for readers.

02:04.602 --> 02:25.969
It was interesting to discover that, for instance, we readers used to read aloud for the longest time, but the natural way of reading, then we picked up on this with trying to understand a text that seems complex, is to read aloud.

02:25.949 --> 02:32.679
silent being did not become common, at least in the Western world until the 10th century.

02:32.699 --> 02:41.652
And in my explorations of the history of being, I came across a wonderful moment in the confessions of St.

02:41.792 --> 02:42.853
Augustine with St.

02:43.034 --> 02:47.881
Augustine, a teacher in Milan.

02:48.061 --> 02:55.872
He had left, he had come from North Africa, come to Rome and try to set up a little school in Rome.

02:56.257 --> 02:58.600
the students for premiums and nobody paid.

02:59.221 --> 03:02.245
By the time they came to pay their rent and they all disappeared.

03:02.465 --> 03:05.530
So he decided to try to get back in Milan.

03:05.550 --> 03:14.221
And in Milan he went to visit one of his mother's acquaintances, Saint Ambrose.

03:15.543 --> 03:22.112
And he comes upon Ambrose in his cell surrounded with books

03:22.413 --> 03:33.199
And obviously doing something that Augustine identifies as reading, which he can't believe is reading because those towns are coming down to found books as far as.

03:33.500 --> 03:45.157
So we have, just like time, a description of how surprising it was to discover a solid reading at that time.

03:45.618 --> 03:53.770
Many of these anecdotes, these hidden readers came about as, as I will explain, as history of reading.

03:54.661 --> 04:03.820
I loved Lin Tarrant-Words' book because it reflected one of those aspects.

04:03.840 --> 04:13.159
A Canadian essay, Stanley Percy, told me once that for readers there must be a million autobiographies because

04:13.308 --> 04:18.756
We recognize ourselves in the experience that others have written about.

04:18.796 --> 04:28.350
And Sharon Schwartz's book seems to me an encapsulated version of all those readings.

04:28.631 --> 04:35.762
It's also the history of possession, of just accumulation of the things we love.

04:36.182 --> 04:42.792
And that, as I'm sure we hear, is Nicholas Batten's book, which he calls the general madness.

04:43.042 --> 04:48.182
this obsession with having as hours of all things to read.

04:50.451 --> 04:52.258
The invention of the printing press

04:53.015 --> 04:58.205
put forward the idea that there can be a number of identical books.

04:59.207 --> 05:03.996
Up to the invention of the printing press, of course, every manuscript necessarily is different.

05:04.016 --> 05:11.771
In fact, the scribes had no, there were no editors at the time who would decide you cannot do this.

05:12.272 --> 05:13.875
So scribes would

05:14.092 --> 05:18.617
in the book.

05:18.637 --> 05:25.184
It invented, in fact, the revised versions of the text.

05:25.625 --> 05:43.525
With the invention of the printing version, it seems as if you and I can read the same book, when in fact, we know that is not the case, because my book has a copy stain on page 74, and it has a memory of the case in which I read it, and it has those biblical parts.

05:43.505 --> 05:45.871
and Martin and so on.

05:46.413 --> 05:57.784
Each book becomes a unique copy, and so we want to possess it, we want to achieve it, and we want to base it in our history, our history of reading,

05:58.642 --> 06:06.190
There was also the need to somehow classify that which we have accumulated.

06:06.210 --> 06:21.747
I love one of our ancestors, the reader of the 10th century, the Grand Vizier, who had a collection of over 100,000 books.

06:22.013 --> 06:28.568
And in order to transport them from face to face, he had his panels open up by the crawlers.

06:31.856 --> 06:33.981
You can find them over easy.

06:34.838 --> 06:50.781
Those who were fascinated by books were known, for instance, in the Library of Alexandria, where the poet Galimachus tried to establish some sort of an order for both the human beings.

06:51.142 --> 06:55.748
But those are ordainers of the universe, and they think of the substance.

06:55.768 --> 06:59.694
Every reader is an ordainer of the universe.

06:59.714 --> 07:02.398
The universe, of course, is image of the libraries.

07:02.783 --> 07:07.870
is the image that Borges gave us for all time.

07:08.431 --> 07:17.643
He speaks of the library of the universe in the library of Denmark.

07:18.524 --> 07:22.089
Let me direct to my encounter with Borges.

07:22.269 --> 07:24.893
I was 16 years old at the time.

07:25.362 --> 07:32.853
And I was working in Anglo-German books for the Buenos Aires and had heard of Voyage.

07:32.873 --> 07:39.202
One of the reasons I didn't think he was important was because we had studied him in school.

07:41.665 --> 07:53.462
And as so many readers, I was put off by that which those who were older readers supposedly wired at once and not was told in the way.

07:53.830 --> 08:01.485
And when he came into the bookstore, he was almost completely blind and he was accompanied by his 90-year-old mother.

08:02.627 --> 08:05.152
And he was looking for books on Anglo-Saxon.

08:05.172 --> 08:07.256
He was studying Anglo-Saxon at the time.

08:07.276 --> 08:13.628
His mother would get very angry and would say, Georgie, I don't know why you don't study something useful like Latin or Greek.

08:14.620 --> 08:21.170
And one day he asked me if I would come and read to him in the evenings and his mother was very tired.

08:21.731 --> 08:29.402
Now, he asked me and he asked dozens of other people who were somehow privileged.

08:29.422 --> 08:33.989
And for about two years I read more of this on and off.

08:34.429 --> 08:41.640
And the extraordinary experience was that it gave me

08:42.025 --> 08:44.368
A private annotated edition.

08:44.729 --> 08:46.932
He would choose, of course, what to read.

08:46.952 --> 08:48.354
He would tell me how to read.

08:48.374 --> 08:49.616
He would tell me when to stop.

08:52.240 --> 09:08.303
When I told his anecdote to a friend, I told him it was, as if I were the driver and the boy that was behind me telling me where to go, he said, uh-huh, a case of Homer James or James James.

09:11.084 --> 09:18.133
It was extraordinary to read to Borges because he would interrupt, he would ask me to jot things down.

09:18.153 --> 09:22.278
He would use me as a notepad as he used to all the other people.

09:23.620 --> 09:28.306
And things would occur to him as you read.

09:28.506 --> 09:32.271
So I don't remember what it was that I was reading for him.

09:32.411 --> 09:35.455
It was one of the so-called classics.

09:35.992 --> 09:41.060
And he remarked how awful one of those lines was.

09:42.062 --> 09:47.911
And he wanted to be able to collect the mythology of bad literature by great writers.

09:48.432 --> 09:58.548
He had this wonderful lack of respect that allowed him to compare Plato to Daphne Moyer.

10:01.533 --> 10:02.134
And so

10:02.688 --> 10:08.698
He compiled for the air and air that an impromptu anthology of bad lines by the way back to the war.

10:09.079 --> 10:11.563
There was, for instance, Keats.

10:12.444 --> 10:16.050
The album for all his feathers was a comb.

10:17.152 --> 10:28.932
Or this one, which incited particularly by Webster and the Duchess of Malphie, We Are the Stars Tennis Balls.

10:29.485 --> 10:35.533
There is one in Neruga who he wasn't terribly fond of as a line.

10:36.254 --> 10:37.095
I used to.

10:37.696 --> 10:39.398
I still do.

10:39.999 --> 10:42.502
I used to love Neruga's .

10:43.443 --> 10:50.953
And what he said, yes, there is that first line that says,

10:51.136 --> 10:56.682
I don't know if you can say it in English.

10:58.484 --> 11:01.487
Boina is a little kind of Spanish can.

11:03.188 --> 11:04.970
Yes, that's right.

11:04.990 --> 11:06.792
Thank you.

11:07.012 --> 11:12.758
So the line is something that you were, you were the great beret and it was still hard.

11:13.039 --> 11:15.321
The great beret is something gorgeous, isn't it?

11:18.153 --> 11:24.587
An aspect that I explored in the history of reading was the privacy of reading.

11:25.229 --> 11:35.672
How extraordinary the fact that we can establish this activity without anyone else knowing what takes place.

11:35.905 --> 11:45.075
The rise of silent reading has something to do with this intense privacy.

11:45.095 --> 11:58.010
It is extraordinary how many of the great heresies in the Christian church rise at the time where silent reading becomes pervasive.

12:00.433 --> 12:05.338
There is also a prophylactic aspect

12:05.605 --> 12:06.527
to reading.

12:07.710 --> 12:16.011
Diderot in the 18th century would cure his wife who would suffer from depression.

12:16.031 --> 12:22.888
She was a strongly bigoted woman who you would not imagine as the wife of

12:23.678 --> 12:27.469
very liberal and racy Diderot.

12:27.910 --> 12:36.996
So Diderot would cure her by reading passages from racy Spanish and French novels and he invented this

12:38.022 --> 12:45.270
prescription order of two cases of Chicago and one case between and so on.

12:45.310 --> 12:50.115
And it seems that it's an use here in Armand's ear, did cure her from Verdepressant.

12:50.576 --> 13:05.312
Of course, in the extraordinary role of microbiology in which patients, the nurse also works with the same system, trying to

13:05.292 --> 13:07.996
fewer patients through reading.

13:09.398 --> 13:22.917
But perhaps the aspect that interests me most about reading, the one that made me banish this sense of how was the pleasure of being subversive.

13:23.999 --> 13:28.245
Oliver said that poetry makes nothing happen, and it's true that

13:28.867 --> 13:36.184
a book is there until we read it, until we make something out of it.

13:37.487 --> 13:42.538
And I think across so many cases where readers are able to

13:42.940 --> 13:46.385
turn the book into an extraordinary subversive force.

13:47.186 --> 14:08.374
One very recently, you are probably aware of the wave of censorship and ban writers in Turkey these days, where publishers, journalists, writers, actors are thrown in prison under flinges of offenses against the government.

14:08.354 --> 14:33.028
And recently, an actor and writer, Mayur Binsirai, fed up with the judge who was dictating these rules to him, recited back to the judge a passage of Calvester Trium, which I'm sure didn't share a choice of a piece.

14:33.177 --> 14:37.924
And he was held for contempt of court, thrown into prison.

14:37.944 --> 14:47.879
And then a number of other writers took that same passage, and instead of citing it, CAFTA signed it with their names and sent it to the judge.

14:47.899 --> 14:52.627
It's a very brave gesture, but has not gotten my credit.

14:53.047 --> 15:02.121
So if I make the equal, then it seems that Amnesty International has a proof at the fair, and he would sign a petition for the Turkish writers.

15:03.080 --> 15:04.583
Before we were very grateful.

15:07.768 --> 15:19.789
Fort Reynolds Ford tells a wonderful story which he imagines of Tarek Alexander reading Touheyev's sportsman's sketches.

15:20.073 --> 15:48.257
and first imagining himself as the landowner and slowly imagining himself as the serf behind the landowner and feeling the suffering that Turgenev is describing in the book and three days later of course he establishes the new laws that would remain at least for the time, the life of the serfs.

15:48.878 --> 16:02.970
Another moment of subversive reading, and I like this one particularly because it shows how wide the range of a reader's scope can be.

16:03.010 --> 16:09.616
Ionesco's Rhinoceros was performed in Algeria during the Algerian War.

16:09.636 --> 16:17.603
And at the end of the play, you remember, where the hero who refuses to become a rhinoceros

16:17.920 --> 16:21.104
shouts out, I will not capitulate.

16:21.604 --> 16:32.917
The whole audience cheered the Algerians and the French, those who wanted Algeria to be independent and those who wanted Algeria to remain French.

16:32.997 --> 16:45.411
Finally, that same subversive power is, I think, sometimes best read by those who fear it.

16:45.431 --> 16:46.712
I think censors

16:47.452 --> 16:50.957
are extraordinary subtle readers.

16:51.899 --> 17:16.395
Pinochet, in Chile during the military dictatorship, among the many books he banned, he banned not defaulted, because he felt, and quite rightly, that he should flee for individual human rights, for the sense of freedom and spirit and imagination.

17:17.573 --> 17:23.854
A question that comes up over time now is

17:24.610 --> 17:26.752
whether reading will continue.

17:26.852 --> 17:37.304
George Steiner has said that perhaps we will have reading houses in the future where those quaint enough to read would go to pursue their activity.

17:37.645 --> 17:50.299
But I'm not convinced, you know, I'm not in this immagized mode, or it seems that books will disappear, that people don't read it.

17:50.979 --> 17:54.263
I mean, you are true that that is not the case.

17:55.053 --> 17:58.039
More books have published than ever before.

17:58.059 --> 18:14.935
And also, if I look back at my school, if I look back at my classes at elementary school, high school, and so on, yeah, there were four or five, maybe six or ten friends of mine who I remember were teen readers, but that's about teens.

18:15.218 --> 18:18.325
Most of the class were not keen readers.

18:18.425 --> 18:27.625
They hated the English or Spanish literature class, and they never went to the library and looked at the same thing before.

18:28.178 --> 18:32.886
I'm not afraid of what is called the encroaching technology.

18:32.946 --> 18:35.210
I certainly don't share St.

18:35.250 --> 18:46.048
Burkhardt and Gutenberg energies as this kind of end of the millennium apocalyptic language that were all going to be destroyed by computers and so on.

18:46.068 --> 18:50.035
Everything has never had anything to hear from technology.

18:50.015 --> 19:00.007
We've gone from the clay tablets to the scrolls, to the scrolls, to the coding album, back to the scroll on the computer and so on.

19:01.288 --> 19:05.032
But the technology itself, we won't give you a way to reading it.

19:05.053 --> 19:09.638
In any case, even if we were terrified of the fact, the truth is that it's there.

19:10.459 --> 19:11.620
It's simply there.

19:11.680 --> 19:12.321
It's with us.

19:12.501 --> 19:18.368
And it's up to us to find creative ways of using the technology.

19:18.500 --> 19:21.523
I think that we want definitions.

19:21.543 --> 19:35.094
We just want to know how the book will end, and at the same time, readers know that books don't have an ending, that the best books live beyond the last page.

19:35.715 --> 19:47.865
If we could not wish for a conclusion, if we could allow

19:48.250 --> 20:01.313
this technology to open up new ways of reading for us of going back to methods that have always been there, their interactive text that existed and so on.

20:02.795 --> 20:12.452
The participation of the reader that existed from the very first writer who put that view on a page speaking to me, the general reader.

20:12.432 --> 20:27.814
If we could allow these things and read, perhaps, in a less assertive way, in a vaguely more ambiguous way, a richer way, then perhaps we will continue to cherish this craft of ours.

20:28.935 --> 20:32.500
And I wish you very good leaders of the future.

20:32.720 --> 20:33.141
Thank you.

20:43.634 --> 20:45.617
Thank you.

20:45.637 --> 20:50.103
And lastly has Nicholas Galvin.

20:50.123 --> 20:55.010
What is the visitor file, when the visitor file becomes a video maniac?

20:56.112 --> 20:58.495
There is a fine line between the two.

20:59.577 --> 21:07.829
And although Nicholas Galvin has collected 15,000 worth, he doesn't think that he crossed the line.

21:07.849 --> 21:12.375
But he also admits that you usually don't know what you do.

21:12.845 --> 21:18.733
Badgain is the former book editor of the book of Massachusetts, Cal Brown and Goodick.

21:20.476 --> 21:33.655
The book represents a personal identity of triumph for Badgain who started his career and family's financial future on the book.

21:34.208 --> 21:47.954
During the 80 years of Trent researching and writing a gentle madness, with your files, with your names, and eternal passions of both, he had encounters with two damn items.

21:49.497 --> 21:56.250
One, he lost his job as a book editor, that's paper, and then he lost his book contract.

21:56.872 --> 22:09.529
One is your clothing that his book probably wouldn't count more than 2,000 copies, and another said that the subjects were too similar claims, even for a university's press.

22:09.549 --> 22:21.985
His 12 years at the newspaper now, though, are keen in his approach to a new subject, searching for a carnal personality, eyeball facts, and unusual incidents.

22:22.437 --> 22:32.149
Bad Daniels is a good story when he sees it, and several interesting things happened to him while reading his book.

22:32.169 --> 22:42.302
From the largest book auction in the last 50 years, and the arrest and trial of Stephen Bumler, the champion of the Red Bull Chiefs,

22:44.543 --> 23:00.222
After traveling over 100,000 miles and compiling a 400-table bibliography, Badgain has grown through his worldly, youthful savings, and borrowed money from his family for expenses.

23:01.124 --> 23:03.667
Won't this happen?

23:03.687 --> 23:07.952
To be continued by our guest, it was Badgain.

23:12.927 --> 23:15.050
Thank you very much to me.

23:15.130 --> 23:17.133
Actually, I'm often asked how you cropped the line.

23:18.534 --> 23:20.137
And I like to ask, I'm on the cusp.

23:21.038 --> 23:37.660
And 15,000 books are now up to around 20,000, which leads us to a very interesting question that the three speakers we've already addressed to have quite rightly discussed the joys of reading, the pleasures of reading, the nourishment we get from books.

23:37.680 --> 23:41.365
My book is almost a little on the margin.

23:41.345 --> 23:49.014
I'm often asked if he thought, these people you have described are remarkable, eccentric, but do they read their books?

23:49.034 --> 23:51.477
You know, that's a fair question.

23:51.817 --> 23:56.783
One of the definitions of book collecting often given is how do you know where you're a collector?

23:57.945 --> 24:04.332
A cynical answer is you know you're a collector the day you buy a book you're certainly never reading.

24:04.767 --> 24:34.774
that wasn't pretty cynical perhaps but uh i just i just met with a gentleman in detroit a couple of days ago who has a remarkable collection of first editions by uh and i think that a lot of lessons of course i could probably can you read these books because of course not but you know the first edition you think of the very first book of uh constituents printed in north america that was acknowledged to be collectible the day it came off the press which is the alien indian bible

24:34.754 --> 24:38.765
This book was a great library, great collections all over the world.

24:39.326 --> 24:45.884
Well, that book was written in the Algonquin language, the Jewish Testament in the Algonquin language.

24:45.904 --> 24:49.995
Nobody could read that book.

24:50.313 --> 24:59.672
The day I went to visit with William Scheide, which I described as my chapter six, this man is acknowledged to be perhaps a racist book collector alive.

25:00.254 --> 25:02.057
He's a third generation collector.

25:02.538 --> 25:09.132
His library comes at the Five Stone Library at Princeton University, and he's very much a private collection.

25:09.280 --> 25:12.183
I'll never forget the day I was there, the first visit.

25:12.684 --> 25:17.950
This man who was in the 80s and walked over to a safe where he kept some really extra-rich treasure.

25:18.791 --> 25:24.237
He was lugging a huge clamshell box, which he opened up and reviewed his book.

25:25.058 --> 25:26.280
And I said, can I help you, sir?

25:26.300 --> 25:27.761
You know, you sit down over there.

25:28.462 --> 25:32.807
And he opened the box, reviewing to me his book of your Bible.

25:33.783 --> 25:36.589
And I always travel with a tape recorder.

25:36.609 --> 25:37.911
The tape, you could hear it.

25:38.232 --> 25:40.636
This elderly gentleman saying, are you all right?

25:40.656 --> 25:44.163
And I said, I am a big lightheaded actor, right?

25:44.183 --> 25:51.117
Now, it isn't often that you are invited to touch where metal type bins paper for the first time.

25:51.097 --> 25:59.109
And he invited me to not only handle the book, and to feel it really, and to smell the old leather and the paper.

25:59.369 --> 26:07.962
But then we sat down for 45 minutes, and he just proceeded to describe this book letter by letter, how there were no hyphen.

26:08.763 --> 26:10.065
He pointed out with pinholes.

26:10.225 --> 26:18.758
He was the first book to imprint that Reese's leaves had to be secured to the press with little mail, so they wouldn't wiggle around the paper.

26:18.738 --> 26:21.663
So you say, can we get duty for books?

26:21.763 --> 26:22.605
Can we get lightheaded?

26:22.705 --> 26:26.211
What is it about a book that really has no actual value?

26:26.912 --> 26:28.935
It's like diamonds, or pearls, or silver.

26:29.055 --> 26:30.057
It's really a paper.

26:30.077 --> 26:30.738
And it's terrible.

26:30.859 --> 26:34.565
Why are the people who spend thousands of dollars on a book?

26:35.146 --> 26:37.510
Well, the second thing went, you know, 50 cents.

26:37.890 --> 26:39.413
And it's happening.

26:39.393 --> 26:44.219
You do have an editorial chair down here, wonderful editorial chair.

26:44.340 --> 26:47.484
You'll see a first edition of Fox here, you know, $1,500.

26:47.504 --> 26:54.313
You know, you have the same book at home, but you picked up a good reading copy for a Bible or whatever.

26:54.854 --> 27:02.744
Why is it that people really spend this kind of money to get a first edition or to get a book that really has some meaning for it?

27:02.844 --> 27:06.169
Well, I think Winston Churchill sums it up.

27:06.189 --> 27:08.472
I quote him in my chapter one.

27:08.452 --> 27:12.723
Winston Churchill had a library of, what, 50,000 or so books.

27:12.743 --> 27:14.849
He was asked, have you read all these books?

27:14.929 --> 27:16.032
He said, of course not.

27:16.132 --> 27:18.057
Possibly read 50,000 books.

27:18.458 --> 27:26.148
But what is important is that a gentleman knows what's in his library, where it is when he meets this and how he can gain from it.

27:26.168 --> 27:30.754
To which I would add, you know, I can provide a book that I don't expect I will never read.

27:31.175 --> 27:32.476
But I think I might like to read.

27:32.596 --> 27:36.742
And I certainly can use it as a professional writer or as a reference.

27:36.862 --> 27:41.668
A library where Cicero says it doesn't provide control for a home.

27:41.688 --> 27:44.652
I can't imagine how it's going to hold another library for those books.

27:45.070 --> 27:51.599
and have indicated how various folks have shaped their lives and shaped their professions.

27:52.600 --> 27:56.185
I should tell you how that title came to be.

27:58.128 --> 28:08.783
I'm from Wilson, Massachusetts, where we have distinctively, I hesitate to use the word unique, but a distinctive American institution that you really only find here in the United States.

28:08.763 --> 28:22.914
It's a library that is formed by a book collector, a library that exists quite apart from the university, where there's money left, and the seed core collection is a collectivist library.

28:23.195 --> 28:26.923
This is known as the American Aquarian Society, happens to be in Worcester.

28:26.903 --> 28:39.831
Others are the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York, the Henry Huntington Library in California, the Winn-Andy Clark Library in Los Angeles, the Fulminus Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C.

28:40.512 --> 28:46.465
They're worth naming because there really is quite a number of the John Carter Brown Library of Providence,

28:46.445 --> 28:48.768
Clemens Library at the University of Michigan.

28:49.248 --> 28:54.815
These libraries basically were put together by people who had a passion for certain fields of influence.

28:54.835 --> 29:05.047
The Shakespeare Library at the Case in Point, Bolger and Dwight were childless, but they decided to build this great library.

29:05.067 --> 29:07.390
Their family would be this collection of books.

29:07.370 --> 29:11.676
They have 79 first folders of the 200 oddities of the Civil War.

29:12.177 --> 29:20.249
And everyone's going into that library and seeing them all laid out like gold ingots and being allowed to take whatever time brought the job.

29:20.490 --> 29:22.453
This is the first printed text of Shakespeare.

29:22.473 --> 29:23.995
This is how we get Shakespeare.

29:24.548 --> 29:44.093
And if you get Shakespeare strictly from print, because there are no surviving manuscripts when we talk about the printed book and what it serves to pass on, I think this is what I was trying to do in a gentle manner, not just to go out and document the activities of these people who are so possessed of acquiring things,

29:44.073 --> 29:45.775
but also the general theme.

29:46.036 --> 29:55.027
So much of what we know, we learn about ourselves, our history, our literature, our culture, would absolutely be lost if we were introduced to people who collect books.

29:55.047 --> 30:01.997
And Gene mentioned the problems that I had publishing this book, getting a publisher interested in it.

30:02.217 --> 30:03.579
I can understand it.

30:03.599 --> 30:09.186
My good friend Will Austin here, a book editor, he might have been here walking in New York.

30:09.166 --> 30:11.849
was Bill telling him about this book I had mine.

30:12.410 --> 30:13.571
And he said, well, what's it about?

30:13.951 --> 30:15.433
Oh, I'm going to write about book collectors.

30:16.534 --> 30:19.557
And Bill, like so many others, would give me a stinking book.

30:20.739 --> 30:21.159
Really?

30:21.499 --> 30:30.089
So I stopped telling people, what is it about book collectors, you know, that other people who are not book collectors might be interested in reading well.

30:30.109 --> 30:31.310
But there was a new theme.

30:31.530 --> 30:37.637
And I tried to trace it through 25 centuries, 23 centuries or whatever, starting in Alexandria.

30:38.005 --> 30:52.926
uh in egypt for the great greek collectors just acquired so many things and this library existed

30:53.733 --> 31:04.272
But being an old journalist, an old newspaper guy who loves good stories, it seemed to me that another story that had never been done, and I do have that bibliography.

31:04.292 --> 31:07.879
The bibliography of my book is my primary collection right now.

31:08.660 --> 31:12.467
I think I know 95% of all the books in my own bibliography.

31:13.628 --> 31:24.634
was that none of these books had ever gone out and profiled living collectors, found these people who I maintain exist in this continuum, who have preserved things, who have saved things.

31:25.137 --> 31:27.941
And so a whole new endeavor began.

31:28.742 --> 31:29.804
Part one was the history.

31:29.924 --> 31:32.748
I did a lot, most of my reading at Harvard University.

31:32.969 --> 31:34.331
We have over 13 million books.

31:35.172 --> 31:37.335
And I could really just about find anything I wanted.

31:37.916 --> 31:42.804
But now it was time to go out there, you know, to meet people, to find the stories.

31:42.824 --> 31:45.307
And this really became the heart of my book.

31:45.748 --> 31:53.119
I was blessed in that some of the great options in the last 25 or 30 years, more than what's happened under my watch,

31:53.318 --> 32:06.161
There was a Rattling Market sale, a Skelter Mahini sale, a sale called The Garden a little bit, in which on one night, $16.5 million was spent for 300 books.

32:06.181 --> 32:07.644
And that sounds like a lot of money.

32:08.145 --> 32:13.976
I guess to all of us in the room, that sale only got three paragraphs from the New York Times.

32:14.617 --> 32:15.799
Totally lost.

32:15.779 --> 32:16.941
Why is that?

32:17.002 --> 32:28.044
The day before, in the same Washington house, in the same room, one painting by William de Kooning, a living artist, sold for $21 million.

32:28.726 --> 32:34.277
That week, perhaps $150, $200 million was spent for painting, for artwork.

32:34.814 --> 32:39.663
So we talk about books and how valuable they are.

32:39.683 --> 32:41.547
There is a perspective, you know.

32:42.268 --> 32:53.069
Had the person who spent $21 million for that tomb decided to build a library, could have bought one of them, a great library, and had $5 million left over to build a building.

32:53.810 --> 32:57.818
And he needed perhaps a valid share on a library of events.

32:57.798 --> 33:02.764
But that story was lost, and that became a fascinating story.

33:02.784 --> 33:10.312
Because as I learned, a person who had put this library together was a pseudonymous person.

33:10.953 --> 33:20.584
And it had actually been a civil case that forced this library to be sold.

33:21.285 --> 33:24.328
When I started to look into it and pounded the files,

33:24.899 --> 33:34.386
So I was trying to find out who the person was and how he managed to get $20 million in other man's money.

33:34.585 --> 33:36.468
and to use it to build this library.

33:36.488 --> 33:40.032
And I call that chapter, To Have and To Have No More.

33:41.595 --> 33:45.560
The man's name is Haven of Olor, which is an acronym for Have No More.

33:45.580 --> 33:46.721
It's not his real name.

33:47.943 --> 33:50.146
I found out what his real name is.

33:51.067 --> 33:54.152
And I discovered that in the book, how I found it.

33:54.692 --> 33:58.257
And since publication, the book was determined to occur in the day.

33:58.818 --> 34:01.842
And we'll do that for our future piece.

34:02.210 --> 34:04.774
That's what we call a development story.

34:06.616 --> 34:11.423
Early one morning in 1990, I'm reading USA Today, I feel a little story.

34:12.164 --> 34:17.631
Now, I understand we had an amazing book, A Gentle Madness, and I feel kind of how that came to pass.

34:17.771 --> 34:22.198
Isaiah Thomas was a great patriot, printer, publisher.

34:22.358 --> 34:24.381
He wrote a book, which is still in print today.

34:24.401 --> 34:29.027
The oldest book in print, continuous, probably this year printing in North America.

34:29.007 --> 34:31.811
He's the most prominent bookseller.

34:31.831 --> 34:33.053
He had his own factory.

34:33.173 --> 34:34.776
He was using papers and selling books.

34:35.297 --> 34:36.178
He printed Bibles.

34:36.619 --> 34:38.281
He's remembered for nothing yesterday.

34:38.301 --> 34:42.808
What he's remembered for was his hobby, which became the American Aquarian Society.

34:43.669 --> 34:55.167
When he died, his grandson, Benjamin Franklin Thomas, said, Grandfather was afflicted from the earliest of ages by the gentleness of infirmities he completely obeyed at.

34:55.535 --> 34:58.161
I remember seeing that in the words of my title.

34:58.602 --> 35:05.997
Now that title was in place the day I read of the arrest of Oklahoma, Iowa, Stephen Ornberg.

35:06.017 --> 35:16.159
This man was arrested in an old Victorian house, 24,000 books, and was initially estimated to be worth perhaps $20 million.

35:16.561 --> 35:17.883
And they're all there.

35:17.903 --> 35:26.897
What makes them very interesting to me as a thief, by the way, is the fact that he sold these books because he loved them.

35:26.917 --> 35:28.480
He didn't steal them himself.

35:28.500 --> 35:32.125
I mean, reason is not a factor in this particular case.

35:32.626 --> 35:38.756
I'm going to forget going to the trial and the prosecutors saying over and over again, he is just a thief.

35:38.776 --> 35:40.138
He is just a thief.

35:40.237 --> 35:44.672
And I said, he is a thief, but he's not just a thief.

35:44.692 --> 35:51.715
And it became my intention there to try and probe this man

35:51.931 --> 36:13.467
the force is trying to understand the forces that they're moving into to acquire 24 000 books from 268 libraries in 45 states participating in provinces in the district of columbia and he's going to the record and he wanted to get all 50 before it was done

36:13.767 --> 36:14.809
How did he do this?

36:14.969 --> 36:16.492
You know, why did he do it?

36:16.512 --> 36:17.694
Over a 20-year period.

36:17.875 --> 36:20.460
And by the way, he didn't get caught the way that he falls into the zone.

36:20.480 --> 36:21.682
I think it's really out there.

36:21.702 --> 36:24.547
He'd be well over the 50 states by now.

36:24.567 --> 36:32.041
Except for his own friend, who got into trouble with the federal government, and negotiated to deal with insurance for money.

36:32.061 --> 36:32.923
He was arrested.

36:33.325 --> 36:42.617
When they started to look at new books and try to determine who owned them, they thought, number one, that we had removed all of the book plates.

36:43.258 --> 36:55.775
Any identifying mark that were going to be able to get rid of these books came from.

36:55.795 --> 36:57.437
Fortunately, within the collection, we kept a scrapbook of book plates.

36:57.457 --> 36:59.400
Three scrapbooks of book plates.

36:59.768 --> 37:01.910
I remember driving with him.

37:02.131 --> 37:04.053
I spent a day with him bearing a child.

37:04.994 --> 37:06.736
And this was wonderful.

37:06.756 --> 37:18.689
I was here in New York, and he was out on the hill by the way.

37:18.709 --> 37:22.454
The principal provision is he couldn't go get any life out of the book.

37:22.474 --> 37:24.696
And remained within the state of Iowa.

37:24.929 --> 37:27.613
He was fascinated by that.

37:27.633 --> 37:33.782
He said, do you want to write about me as a book of book collectors?

37:33.822 --> 37:34.744
He said, for sure.

37:35.505 --> 37:40.512
He put you in the same book with J.P.

37:40.793 --> 37:44.338
Warren and Henry Huntington.

37:44.318 --> 37:52.715
What you were looking for, what the focus was.

37:52.796 --> 37:59.830
You know, in fact, what's that extinguishing, the collection from accumulation is focused.

38:00.012 --> 38:04.661
you know, an interest book that really inspired me and moved to do this.

38:04.681 --> 38:08.068
Steven introduced his focus he had with Americana.

38:08.669 --> 38:20.772
He is considered as one of the training grade experts on the 19th century American architecture city and so he told me this collection started as a reference library.

38:21.342 --> 38:27.974
And if it's within your book collectors, one of these to another, it's explaining the 100th in funeral began.

38:27.994 --> 38:39.074
Well, the funeral is a book that is published in the creating period of the print, about the 1450 or so, but we can write by the name of the most prominent one, up to 1500.

38:39.535 --> 38:41.038
He had 100 movies.

38:41.356 --> 38:49.030
including the Ureberg Chronicle, which is one who is a property criminalized college in California.

38:49.050 --> 38:50.733
It's a hundred and two of them.

38:50.753 --> 38:56.023
It's not bad, not for a collection in the latter part of the 20th century.

38:56.155 --> 39:00.002
His had no work on it was estimated to be worth $100,000.

39:00.864 --> 39:07.736
He had to see Connecticut's own copy of the first book printed in Connecticut.

39:07.756 --> 39:18.356
How he managed to get this, we still don't know, because this came from the Connecticut State Library, which is absolutely a public.

39:18.436 --> 39:20.239
It's not a general circulation library.

39:20.219 --> 39:22.282
And for a team, we kept those.

39:22.783 --> 39:27.951
We were coming back from the area of flea market in Massachusetts.

39:27.971 --> 39:30.556
We traveled, we paid it, we sold the car.

39:31.337 --> 39:33.540
We sent one of the people across the street to the St.

39:33.641 --> 39:36.445
House and Hartley to steal a couple of dorms.

39:36.465 --> 39:40.011
We'll get to the dealer out there.

39:40.271 --> 39:44.438
But we went in that confession, particularly the American folks.

39:45.278 --> 39:45.699
Yes.

39:46.299 --> 39:49.724
During the trial, we talked, and we became friendly.

39:50.625 --> 39:59.477
And then he invited me during an off day to travel with him down to a tunnel, which I did take the whole conversation.

39:59.497 --> 40:01.459
He's driving along, you'll see a dumpster.

40:02.961 --> 40:09.430
The car will come to a Korean stop, get that car, guides into the dumpster, head for us.

40:09.697 --> 40:11.721
The thing is shaking around the garbage.

40:11.761 --> 40:18.633
Thankfully, I had one picture in the book of him emerging from the dumpster of a book.

40:21.218 --> 40:24.484
And it turned out it was a warranty hearty thing.

40:24.504 --> 40:27.469
We figured out it was probably worth $100.

40:27.972 --> 40:38.299
This is perfect, because his defense, or did I fail to mention, by the way, his defense and his trial, which essentially is criminal, because we're the lady of that, which is what that is.

40:38.319 --> 40:39.923
Those are the documents.

40:40.122 --> 40:49.596
This is a book titled Gentle Madness, and this defense is not guilty by reason of insanity, which I thought was quite frivolous until I got to the trial.

40:50.998 --> 40:56.386
He said to me once during I tried, by the way, he did not want to be judged insane.

40:56.447 --> 41:03.137
His family, which was the family of some demons, was pushing this defense.

41:03.177 --> 41:04.799
They clearly admitted the theft.

41:05.640 --> 41:08.104
He said, Nick, do you think I'm crazy?

41:08.962 --> 41:14.709
You see, the only person in every single head person is a dumpster.

41:14.729 --> 41:15.930
He said, I haven't caught him.

41:16.070 --> 41:17.332
He rescued a treasure.

41:17.352 --> 41:18.553
He said, he really rescued a treasure.

41:19.074 --> 41:22.198
He really believed he was a rescue of these things.

41:22.218 --> 41:34.412
And if you have a chance to read this chapter, I mean, you'll see that he has had nine episodes in his life where he has actually been in institutions and being looked at, evaluated.

41:34.392 --> 41:38.919
Apparently this started when he was 12, 13 years old.

41:38.939 --> 41:44.287
He started going to condemn the buildings and removing stained glass windows and door homes.

41:44.367 --> 41:47.592
Fixers and any number of other things.

41:47.692 --> 41:54.643
He was concerned that these old Victorian homes were being torn down and destroyed to make way for infestation.

41:55.223 --> 41:56.385
That kind of started there.

41:57.347 --> 42:00.872
When we went to visit the house where the books were kept,

42:00.852 --> 42:02.715
He took me over to his warehouse.

42:02.835 --> 42:12.728
He had, we believe, as many as nine warehouses all over the country, in which were kept renards, stained glass and doors, all kinds of artifacts.

42:12.828 --> 42:16.073
In this particular warehouse, there were 50,000 doorknobs.

42:17.475 --> 42:18.136
He would take.

42:19.097 --> 42:27.128
And he asked me, would you like a memento of our day together?

42:27.148 --> 42:27.889
I said, sure.

42:27.869 --> 42:37.465
I need you to grab a door and I need you to do it.

42:37.486 --> 42:38.046
I need you to do it.

42:38.067 --> 42:40.831
I need you to do it.

42:40.851 --> 42:43.275
I need you to do it.

42:43.456 --> 42:45.900
I need you to do it.

42:45.920 --> 42:46.922
I need you to do it.

42:46.942 --> 42:47.683
I need you to do it.

42:48.338 --> 42:51.361
So I have a drawn-out, which we described.

42:51.381 --> 42:52.282
We looked at it.

42:52.302 --> 42:54.345
It was one of the old brasses.

42:54.625 --> 42:58.429
You look at some of these drawn-outs, by the way, they are a really beautiful thing.

42:59.030 --> 43:02.854
He knows everything that is about them.

43:02.874 --> 43:05.477
1892, Robertson, Rothersbury, Pennsylvania.

43:06.117 --> 43:11.183
But the books, the books were really put together to nourish this collection.

43:11.203 --> 43:12.544
And I called that chapter.

43:12.564 --> 43:14.987
It was a blumbering collection, by the way.

43:14.967 --> 43:18.312
I said to him another time, Stephen, why?

43:18.332 --> 43:21.596
He said, you know, when I first was elected, they said that Ms.

43:21.616 --> 43:23.559
Springfield is already at a medical facility.

43:24.520 --> 43:27.825
And word is, elected, and spread around.

43:28.426 --> 43:36.537
And this mafia gone, whose name is me, by the way, and I checked it out too, called him in the car.

43:36.719 --> 43:38.706
Hey, you know, I don't understand.

43:38.726 --> 43:42.038
He said, a guy with less skills.

43:42.058 --> 43:44.608
I did skills in the market, by the way.

43:44.628 --> 43:45.852
He said, you study challenge.

43:46.169 --> 43:47.410
He said, why?

43:47.430 --> 43:50.433
Why are bones and diamonds?

43:51.694 --> 43:52.094
Why books?

43:52.114 --> 43:56.838
He said, we don't understand because I didn't steal these books themselves.

43:56.858 --> 43:58.480
I sold them to the people.

43:58.880 --> 44:01.843
And I said, that wasn't the guy who thought I really was crazy in terms of the procession.

44:01.863 --> 44:05.126
Why is me and my book so protective about Stephen Bloomer?

44:05.146 --> 44:07.047
Well, first of all, it's a great story.

44:07.968 --> 44:10.831
And so that's the first threshold he passes.

44:11.371 --> 44:14.674
But it also seems to me that we have an example of excess

44:14.654 --> 44:18.178
of a collective who literally has flown over the cliff.

44:19.119 --> 44:21.061
You know, there's something that's striking to that.

44:21.461 --> 44:24.024
Largely, you know, there are 14 chapters in the book.

44:24.685 --> 44:27.688
That is the one example of a great set.

44:27.848 --> 44:41.623
I love, you know, the stories of Charles Watson, for instance, the great football player who put together an arguing leader with the finest African Americans watching the United City as a couple of years ago.

44:42.076 --> 44:48.469
This man was offered in an ironclad contract with the New York Giants in 1957.

44:49.090 --> 44:51.114
He played with Lenny Moore.

44:51.695 --> 44:53.078
He played with Goldie Greer.

44:53.258 --> 44:54.741
I interviewed Lenny Moore in 2015.

44:54.761 --> 45:00.152
And I first heard that Charles walked away from the Giants that we thought he was crazy.

45:00.672 --> 45:03.155
I said, Charles, why did you walk away from the Giants?

45:03.736 --> 45:08.341
He said, in his words, I wanted to be a black bibliophile.

45:08.361 --> 45:22.618
When he was seven years old, growing up in Norristown, Pennsylvania, a teacher had told him, he had asked, why is it that I never read, when I'm reading the history books, why is it that there are never any references to me from that bibliophile?

45:22.638 --> 45:25.802
And the teacher said, Charles, black people have no history.

45:27.048 --> 45:28.895
And that bothered him.

45:28.915 --> 45:31.624
You know, my grandfather was a slave.

45:31.665 --> 45:33.632
He escaped on the underground railroad.

45:33.652 --> 45:35.679
He used to sit on the porch and hear these stories.

45:35.699 --> 45:37.044
He used to hear about our family.

45:37.265 --> 45:38.188
He had a history.

45:38.911 --> 45:45.660
And he set out to document and put together this collection, which he started at the age of seven, eight or nine.

45:46.321 --> 45:49.125
And when he was at Penn State, he was also a great track star.

45:49.746 --> 46:02.844
He was going to New York, going to Madison Square Garden, and on an off day, taking the A train up to Harlem, going into the Schaumburg Center, which is the great African American collection of the world.

46:03.565 --> 46:06.910
Also put together by a collector, I know you're part of the piece.

46:06.890 --> 46:09.754
And walking in and saying, I'm not alone.

46:09.934 --> 46:11.516
You know, somebody else has done this.

46:12.658 --> 46:18.626
I heard the money board letter said, we thought he was crazy, but he did better than anyone else.

46:18.646 --> 46:24.513
What he was doing today with the Watson Collection, he's going to campus, and I wouldn't remember, there's 80,000 books.

46:25.354 --> 46:31.783
And as a president of the University of Tiffany, the most important element of the Watson Collection is Charlottesville.

46:31.763 --> 46:37.352
If it seems rare, he asked people through, coming in to try to find out a genealogy.

46:38.013 --> 46:49.212
Well, this is a collector who makes it there, who has done something, but also less stuff for our future, future scholars, readers, like yourselves.

46:49.232 --> 46:51.856
I'll conclude with one brief little anecdote.

46:52.597 --> 46:57.906
Albertjoe mentions how it depends on the library of the future.

46:58.105 --> 47:03.036
There's a new school that was just built out of Monterey, California.
