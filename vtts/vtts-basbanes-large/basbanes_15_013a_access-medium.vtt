00:02.039 --> 00:31.725
Well, it's a great mistake because my publisher said to me, Bob Gottlieb said to me, Bill, every one of your books is different and that's the problem.

00:32.330 --> 00:37.896
The mercurial is mine.

00:39.418 --> 00:44.844
If I could pick the substance that most fascinates me and which is most like me, it's quicksilver.

00:45.445 --> 00:50.551
And with that, it's all over the place.

00:50.571 --> 00:54.716
These things bond according to their own life, according to their own energy.

00:55.316 --> 00:58.961
I'm trying to be faithful to the energy that's appearing today.

00:58.981 --> 01:01.864
I saw a little new piece about a Russian woodcutter

01:02.536 --> 01:06.101
who found a mastodon in a block of ice.

01:07.242 --> 01:10.327
And I thought, and then the energy in that was tremendous.

01:10.407 --> 01:12.430
So that's what you write.

01:13.231 --> 01:16.415
You write what's given to you.

01:16.435 --> 01:18.558
You've written for children as well.

01:18.578 --> 01:21.282
Tell me about, and I respect that, by the way.

01:21.542 --> 01:26.829
I love children in these books.

01:26.849 --> 01:29.493
And you don't mind if we jump around the block on things.

01:30.274 --> 01:32.357
Tell me a little bit about...

01:32.793 --> 01:40.641
Do you consciously sit down and write a book for kids and then turn off that tap and do the other tap?

01:40.961 --> 01:41.722
It comes calling.

01:41.842 --> 01:50.051
I saw on Gumbel's show in the morning, one morning, an interview with Texas millionaires who had the first teddy bear.

01:50.391 --> 01:53.855
They kept this teddy bear in a safe because it was worth a million dollars.

01:54.335 --> 01:55.817
I thought, the poor teddy bear.

01:55.837 --> 01:57.198
Man, he's locked in this safe.

01:57.318 --> 01:59.020
I want to liberate the teddy bear.

01:59.101 --> 02:06.049
So I wrote The Million Dollar Bear, which is coming out next year, and it's The Liberation of the Teddy Bear.

02:06.769 --> 02:11.835
And that one came to me in the only form it could be, a children's book.

02:12.095 --> 02:15.679
I mean, of course, we could have a couple of gangsters liberate the teddy bear.

02:15.719 --> 02:16.580
Maybe I'll do that next.

02:16.880 --> 02:19.083
But for this, I wanted kids.

02:19.864 --> 02:25.750
I remembered my teddy bear, and no child would put his teddy bear in a safe, only a couple of them.

02:26.168 --> 02:27.129
Texas millionaires.

02:27.169 --> 02:28.491
This is investment.

02:28.511 --> 02:28.891
Yeah.

02:29.111 --> 02:29.772
Right.

02:29.792 --> 02:30.973
Buying for value.

02:30.993 --> 02:31.334
Yes.

02:32.075 --> 02:43.187
And to extend this further, I would like to give kids the magic of their lives instead of the madness of their lives.

02:43.267 --> 02:48.533
And in that, in such ideas as liberating a teddy bear, I think they find the magic of their lives.

02:48.573 --> 02:54.960
There's some things I'd like to give to kids to get them out of the groove that they're being poured into.

02:55.328 --> 03:02.056
You know, Salvador Dali was at war with his father because his father wanted him to be a straight and narrow citizen.

03:02.076 --> 03:12.688
He used to shit in the family drawers and hide turds in the drawers just to break his father's will because he didn't want to be changed.

03:12.748 --> 03:21.057
He knew that we were born with the gift of great perception and that it's stolen from us.

03:21.077 --> 03:22.939
It's assembled everywhere.

03:23.206 --> 03:27.492
And it's reassembled into the ordinary.

03:27.512 --> 03:29.855
And he refused, and he called it paranoia.

03:30.897 --> 03:31.878
His paranoia.

03:34.041 --> 03:42.032
I'm delighted that you don't consider it any kind of a secondary calling to write the kids.

03:42.052 --> 03:47.059
It takes... You give it equal weight, I guess, in the creative... Absolutely.

03:47.219 --> 03:49.643
I got so far off on that Million Dollar Bear.

03:49.663 --> 03:50.764
I had such a good time with it.

03:50.885 --> 03:51.205
It was...

03:51.539 --> 03:53.981
I swear to God it was being dictated to me.

03:54.001 --> 03:58.105
I mean, I wrote it at night, just every night.

03:58.205 --> 03:59.687
It's a long children's book.

03:59.707 --> 04:10.978
Every night there'd be more there, and it was just there, and it had that kind of feeling, which I always connect to the child level that remains within us, and it's active.

04:12.559 --> 04:16.883
The erudite mind will make sure it's in touch with the child.

04:19.266 --> 04:20.567
Now this book, this new book,

04:21.239 --> 04:28.467
It's certainly not a vanity here, not by anybody here, but it is a novel of the city.

04:29.968 --> 04:39.779
Did you have this in mind, this is a mindful kind of thing, to write a biography of the city as much as you were writing a novel?

04:39.899 --> 04:40.239
Exactly.

04:40.319 --> 04:45.004
Because for me... That's not stretching for me.

04:45.425 --> 04:47.147
I wrote a mystery because I love mysteries.

04:47.367 --> 04:51.111
And for me, one of the greatest mysteries in the world is Manhattan.

04:51.547 --> 04:58.918
It has a quality that comes from the great mass of people who live there.

04:58.958 --> 05:03.224
They constellate a tremendous mental energy.

05:03.705 --> 05:08.112
And this mental energy attracts entities, non-human entities.

05:08.833 --> 05:09.954
They are everywhere.

05:09.974 --> 05:11.877
They're ubiquitous in the city.

05:11.897 --> 05:14.721
They're part of the secret behind the city.

05:15.342 --> 05:20.490
And I like to investigate those aspects.

05:21.010 --> 05:27.039
If I were to try to write a book straight on about that, I'd be dismissed instantly into the wastebasket.

05:27.139 --> 05:31.105
So I let McShane go through his doorways.

05:31.205 --> 05:41.280
I have him listen to the hundred-year-old gate wearing slowly down, because that was how I could get in my chase of the mystery.

05:41.750 --> 05:47.555
of the city because to me there's a spirit behind the city and I went for it.

05:48.035 --> 05:49.957
What went for it?

05:49.997 --> 05:52.319
The spirit of the city or the story?

05:53.820 --> 05:56.883
How did you start this book?

05:56.963 --> 06:10.795
Well, the book started itself ten years ago when I was in the Metropolitan Museum wandering through the Egyptian wing and I saw this unbelievably beautiful box and it had such luminosity.

06:11.213 --> 06:16.300
It was cracked on the side of it, desiccated wood, 2,000 years old, and people played it.

06:16.340 --> 06:17.181
There were the pieces.

06:17.662 --> 06:18.063
Wow!

06:18.543 --> 06:22.749
So I filed it away, and that game board suddenly occurred.

06:22.769 --> 06:24.011
I said, I want to write a mystery.

06:24.091 --> 06:25.373
I want to write about a map.

06:25.813 --> 06:31.962
And a game board is the perfect mystery because it's a labyrinth.

06:32.363 --> 06:33.825
It's an organizational form.

06:34.045 --> 06:36.208
In the Egyptian time, in the Hindu time,

06:36.627 --> 06:40.211
Labyrinth game boards were part of the search for Brahma.

06:40.231 --> 06:44.336
They were part of the search for a spiritual conclusion.

06:44.356 --> 06:45.998
So it's definitely a metaphor for you.

06:46.078 --> 06:47.099
Yeah.

06:47.139 --> 06:54.268
Well, I think the mystery is our life.

06:54.308 --> 06:58.613
The Greeks had a saying, time is a child playing at a game board.

06:59.414 --> 07:03.258
And because they saw games as very serious business.

07:03.759 --> 07:04.660
And McShane...

07:04.994 --> 07:09.939
sees them as serious business, too, because the killer is playing this goddamn game board with him.

07:10.981 --> 07:21.552
And so I then resurrected the Greek mind, the Hindu mind, the Celtic mind, all of whom saw game boards, and the Egyptian mind finally as very serious things.

07:21.572 --> 07:25.457
The Egyptians, when they played that game, it was an oracle for them.

07:25.617 --> 07:26.798
It was their I Ching.

07:27.639 --> 07:34.967
And if you've got somebody, a killer, playing it with you, then I've got what I think humanity has lost,

07:35.470 --> 07:37.413
the seriousness of play.

07:40.157 --> 07:42.601
That's almost an oxymoron, isn't it?

07:42.621 --> 07:43.542
The seriousness of play?

07:43.622 --> 07:45.926
Yeah, but you see, it is for us.

07:45.946 --> 07:51.374
But for them, it was a piece of their liberation.

07:51.875 --> 07:56.302
They were much more interested in liberating powers.

07:56.622 --> 08:02.912
They were connoisseurs of mystery and of the soul, and we are connoisseurs of consumerism.

08:03.415 --> 08:30.874
and we don't know how to play any longer except for big money and big contracts and uh big endorsements and all the rest of it our games are no longer quite what they used to be let me uh you know one thing writing for newspapers is that you do you are able you do hear from people uh the vital signs or response you know i i tell the newspapers somebody calls

08:31.158 --> 08:34.664
plug them through and want to hear from them.

08:34.684 --> 08:36.868
And you'd love to get letters.

08:36.888 --> 08:39.152
You certainly must have an idea of who your reader is.

08:40.254 --> 08:48.929
And I think maybe you think that you're attracting and reaching out to a wider readership with this book?

08:49.129 --> 08:52.195
Well, I want to... And you can go with that question anywhere you want.

08:52.255 --> 08:55.360
Yeah, I think that I'm taking advantage of

08:55.728 --> 09:21.735
a beautiful form and an advantage taking advantage of a signal beautiful form being what the detective form that we all have got sam spade resonating in our minds we are we all are hearing this is the stuff that dreams are made of um he had his maltese falcon and i've got it's funny i was just when i was telling you about the tempest i was about to give you that speech yeah

09:22.137 --> 09:32.211
I wanted to provide the scepter of Pharaoh Akhenaten as my Maltese falcon.

09:32.231 --> 09:33.653
It's the stuff that dreams are made of.

09:34.213 --> 09:42.524
And we're carrying around inside of us this image that Dashiell Hammett, that Raymond Chandler provided for us early on.

09:43.085 --> 09:44.247
We've all got it.

09:44.447 --> 09:46.510
I thought, that is powerful.

09:47.051 --> 09:51.857
The private eye as the archetype, as the carrier of mystery.

09:52.293 --> 10:16.258
and as the there's nothing more spiritual in my mind than a private eye and i know some because all they are are perception they don't create anything they don't make anything all they sell is their perception if their perceptions are on they know who's bugging a corporation if somebody's trying to steal coca-cola cigarettes uh you know formula

10:16.508 --> 10:19.031
And they've got the place bugged, and I know goddamn well they do.

10:19.472 --> 10:23.737
They are hiring private eyes at very high salaries to find out who's planning those bugs.

10:23.757 --> 10:26.660
So it's a game of perception.

10:28.743 --> 10:31.306
Is the gadgetry here legitimate, by the way?

10:31.406 --> 10:32.587
It's all legitimate.

10:32.607 --> 10:36.031
And I know the guy who runs the Pinkerton Risk Assessment.

10:36.051 --> 10:36.832
He's managed it.

10:36.852 --> 10:39.516
And he told me all about this stuff.

10:39.536 --> 10:39.816
And...

10:40.218 --> 10:45.025
You cannot get that Nagra tape recorder that's in that book.

10:45.045 --> 10:51.675
Only an FBI agent can buy this tape recorder from Nagra because it's so sensitive they don't want the mafia to have it.

10:53.738 --> 10:54.459
Or anybody else.

10:54.479 --> 10:55.621
Or anybody else.

10:55.661 --> 10:57.063
Yeah, right, or anybody else.

10:57.544 --> 11:02.131
And so if you're a well-connected private eye, you can get one.

11:02.351 --> 11:04.715
Or if you're a well-connected policeman.

11:04.795 --> 11:06.417
An ordinary policeman can't get one.

11:06.437 --> 11:09.482
He's got to know, he's got to have to pull with the bureau.

11:10.272 --> 11:17.641
So this is another, this is the private eye for the 90s, because the private eye for the 90s is a college graduate.

11:17.661 --> 11:19.663
He's got a degree in criminal justice.

11:19.683 --> 11:21.045
He's a sophisticated guy.

11:21.425 --> 11:28.194
Even if this degree is in an area that doesn't require philosophy, he becomes very philosophical.

11:28.674 --> 11:31.978
I went out with a private eye in Maine, of all places.

11:31.998 --> 11:36.163
Now, there's no place more paranoid than a convenience store in Maine.

11:36.584 --> 11:40.228
You walk in there a stranger, man, and they really look sideways at you.

11:40.968 --> 11:45.114
Here's a guy, very sophisticated, talking to me about literature and things like that.

11:45.414 --> 11:50.581
He parks, we go inside, and the quicksilver comes right over him.

11:50.601 --> 11:52.804
He's a country guy completely.

11:52.824 --> 11:56.369
And he says, Betty, who drives the school bus, she lives down this way, doesn't she?

11:56.389 --> 11:57.991
He says, oh, no, she lives that way.

11:58.372 --> 12:01.195
We go straight to her house.

12:01.215 --> 12:01.876
Just like that.

12:01.956 --> 12:04.760
And I'm standing there covered in embarrassment.

12:04.900 --> 12:05.922
It's a gift, isn't it?

12:05.942 --> 12:06.302
It's a gift.

12:06.322 --> 12:07.284
It sure is a gift.

12:07.604 --> 12:09.827
And to me, on high top then, there, that's Mercury.

12:10.263 --> 12:13.487
That's Mercury, the winged one, you know, in and out.

12:13.507 --> 12:15.971
You don't even know he's there.

12:15.991 --> 12:16.932
I know a private eye.

12:16.992 --> 12:18.074
In fact, he's in my book.

12:18.094 --> 12:19.135
He's the same way.

12:19.175 --> 12:20.477
He's from Des Moines.

12:20.497 --> 12:22.159
I was thinking, writing a book about this guy.

12:23.361 --> 12:23.921
He visited.

12:24.422 --> 12:25.824
We have a place in the Cape.

12:25.844 --> 12:29.649
And his wife flew in to Boston.

12:30.010 --> 12:32.373
I went to pick him up.

12:32.393 --> 12:33.875
And I looked.

12:33.895 --> 12:34.776
I said, well, we're not here.

12:34.796 --> 12:37.119
I went to take him to the Wiz in the head, and I came out.

12:38.020 --> 12:39.983
And then the guy taps me on the shoulder.

12:41.583 --> 12:43.846
Ray, Ray, Ray, I thought you were playing.

12:43.866 --> 12:44.687
Where have you been?

12:44.707 --> 12:45.768
He says, I've been here all along.

12:46.710 --> 12:48.211
You took a piss, you looked around here.

12:49.653 --> 12:50.454
Where the hell?

12:51.415 --> 12:54.139
You know, I mean, it was really scary.

12:54.239 --> 12:56.622
I mean, the guy, and I'm pretty observant.

12:56.702 --> 13:06.294
I mean, I consider myself kind of a detective as an investigative writer, but this guy absolutely made himself part of the woodwork.

13:07.195 --> 13:10.780
And he observed, and when he felt it was time to come out,

13:11.232 --> 13:11.893
It came out.

13:12.033 --> 13:15.058
It must be endemic to the species.

13:15.078 --> 13:17.221
Yeah, it is.

13:17.241 --> 13:22.029
And the best ones are the masters of this particular discipline.

13:24.072 --> 13:29.420
And, you know, McShane, knowing the scent of women's Perkins, is right on target.

13:29.680 --> 13:34.327
I mean, they develop everything they can because they use it all.

13:34.748 --> 13:39.315
There's actually, I don't have this guy in my book, I might have put him in, but there's actually a British...

13:40.122 --> 13:47.329
Bibliophile, Eric Quayle, who actually argues that he can tell the different books by their smells.

13:47.350 --> 13:50.413
I mean, they can identify certain books.

13:50.453 --> 13:53.896
Charles Lamb, they once asked him, oh, you have all these books.

13:54.056 --> 13:55.498
How can you tell one from the other?

13:55.638 --> 13:57.880
And he said, how does a shepherd know his sheep?

13:57.900 --> 14:00.083
How does a shepherd know his sheep?

14:00.163 --> 14:01.344
That was a great answer.

14:01.364 --> 14:01.624
I'm sorry.

14:01.764 --> 14:03.286
No, no, that's good.

14:03.306 --> 14:06.489
It's a relief.

14:06.509 --> 14:09.032
We do jump around.

14:11.813 --> 14:15.399
Sir, were you on something there that I interrupted?

14:15.419 --> 14:17.042
We were just on the private eye.

14:17.423 --> 14:18.605
Why a private eye?

14:18.625 --> 14:19.226
Okay.

14:19.246 --> 14:21.671
What kind of a compact do you make with your readers?

14:22.252 --> 14:26.720
Well, this is what they call an honest detective novel.

14:27.221 --> 14:28.643
It's already been referred to as that.

14:28.683 --> 14:32.370
The clues are there, and if you follow them closely, you can solve it.

14:33.329 --> 14:49.145
I mean, in terms of when we do time travel and things, as we've seen in the other books, and as you noted at lunch, I mean, you made a statement to me, death was there.

14:49.665 --> 14:54.310
And I believed it, and you certainly must believe it.

14:54.330 --> 15:00.576
How do you persuade a reader to accept some of this philosophy?

15:00.636 --> 15:03.319
Because on some level, he knows it's true.

15:03.367 --> 15:27.298
i don't have to persuade him he is already credible at the same time well that i do have to do i have to make it credible but as far as there's no persuasion necessary i'm counting on that i know that he knows she or she knows on that level that you what i look at are shadows literally this right here i watch my shadow on the street especially in big cities

15:27.515 --> 15:29.698
because it's an extra eye for me.

15:29.818 --> 15:31.260
It tells me things about myself.

15:31.340 --> 15:31.820
The shadow.

15:31.840 --> 15:33.222
Yeah, definitely.

15:33.362 --> 15:37.928
The play of the silhouette is defining my mood in ways that I'll get lost on.

15:38.068 --> 15:42.714
And I keep checking back to my shadow to get this information.

15:43.074 --> 15:44.196
I watch out of both.

15:44.396 --> 15:48.401
I watch peripherally when I'm walking, not worried about getting mugged.

15:49.482 --> 15:50.704
I look this way because

15:51.140 --> 15:53.302
other information comes in on the sides.

15:53.642 --> 15:54.383
And you process it.

15:54.423 --> 15:59.468
Yeah, and you ordinarily, we don't process this way because we're single-focused.

15:59.488 --> 16:01.189
We're taught to have single focus.

16:01.229 --> 16:12.900
So all of my techniques are to break down that single focus, and I put them all in the books to do the same thing for people, to break down their single focus, because I know how narrow it is.

16:13.321 --> 16:17.905
So you really do, you mentioned your techniques, we're talking about literary techniques.

16:17.925 --> 16:18.025
Yeah.

16:18.308 --> 16:22.094
But you derive these techniques from the way you comport your life.

16:22.114 --> 16:23.215
I guess this is training?

16:23.295 --> 16:23.996
Yeah, yeah.

16:24.197 --> 16:32.168
And see, that being there is a Tai Chi master of what they call the Wu Chi form, never moving.

16:32.729 --> 16:40.941
A Tai Chi master can stand like this for a half hour at least, not feel any strain whatsoever.

16:41.697 --> 16:43.780
He learns from the tree how to do that.

16:43.980 --> 16:45.302
I've practiced this myself.

16:45.663 --> 16:49.188
This is a Tai Chi master who's several hundred years old.

16:49.488 --> 16:51.531
T-A-I-C-H-I.

16:53.554 --> 16:59.342
Now, I have tremendous regard for this master standing here before us.

16:59.382 --> 17:04.069
When I'm in a city, I'm always taking account of the rooted masters.

17:04.810 --> 17:05.891
Not as a metaphor.

17:06.072 --> 17:08.315
No direct one-on-one.

17:09.256 --> 17:11.299
And it's so...

17:11.887 --> 17:40.071
it absolves you of all the anxiety now all the worry all the monkey madness now what absolves you the interaction with a rooted master who is several hundred years old are you interacting with this absolutely as we speak yes i've acknowledged the master's presence you do that and you get back immediately you get your is it a verbal acknowledgement it can be and it doesn't it doesn't have to be when

17:40.422 --> 18:06.278
when i need it to be verbal it will be and you feel in your soul that it it acknowledges this acknowledgement from you yes or it accepts it accepted because i i make obeisance i i acknowledge how can you how do you know that it is i know i know that i know i know that my life is enchanted in this way once you live within that enchantment you understand

18:06.578 --> 18:07.599
All else are clear.

18:07.759 --> 18:09.701
I alone am clouded, said Lao Tse.

18:09.781 --> 18:10.341
That's what he meant.

18:10.381 --> 18:11.783
Everybody else knows what's going on.

18:11.863 --> 18:16.047
I alone am clouded because I acknowledge the master.

18:16.067 --> 18:18.929
I mean, think of it just this way, simply.

18:18.949 --> 18:21.712
This tree is ten times older.

18:21.992 --> 18:32.802
Look, it's already several hundred years older than us, and it's going to go, you and I will be in your friend's old manuscript collection, and it's going to still be standing here.

18:32.842 --> 18:34.223
Who's got the jump on who?

18:34.557 --> 18:39.124
And this was probably here during, this is, you know, the common is over there.

18:39.144 --> 18:46.636
This witnessed significant times here.

18:46.656 --> 18:48.158
This was here, wasn't it?

18:48.178 --> 18:48.959
That tree.

18:48.979 --> 18:50.622
I'm sure it was.

18:50.782 --> 18:51.243
Oh, yes.

18:51.263 --> 18:52.024
A noble being.

18:52.084 --> 18:54.548
And I, you see, now you've got my secret.

18:54.588 --> 18:55.149
There it is.

18:55.189 --> 18:57.713
There's nothing any more secret than that.

18:58.081 --> 19:00.904
At what point in your life did you discern this?

19:01.184 --> 19:03.847
I mean, is this something that you worked at?

19:04.027 --> 19:10.715
Like Dolly, I discovered it in childhood and fought to keep it, because others would call it paranoia.

19:11.495 --> 19:13.137
That's part of his brilliance.

19:13.297 --> 19:15.580
He calls his sanity paranoia.

19:15.600 --> 19:19.224
I understood it in childhood in a nonverbal way.

19:20.165 --> 19:25.210
As I grew older and became articulate, I was unable to articulate what these feelings were.

19:25.550 --> 19:27.092
But it was a natural progression.

19:27.359 --> 19:31.604
And it led to the position I hold now.

19:35.169 --> 19:48.185
Tell me at what point you determined that you could take all this and process it into storytelling, and really wonderful storytelling, accessible, engaging storytelling.

19:48.726 --> 19:51.950
When I was four and a half, my grandfather gave me a fire engine.

19:51.970 --> 19:52.651
He was a fireman.

19:53.212 --> 19:54.193
I get into that thing.

19:54.494 --> 19:56.917
And I started pedaling, and I thought, I'm free.

19:57.458 --> 19:58.019
I'm free.

19:58.760 --> 20:08.313
When I was 24, I was mucking around, imitating other riders, paying my dues, but I hadn't gotten the voice yet.

20:08.333 --> 20:16.223
And one day, I suddenly felt myself, I was in my office at my typewriter, and I suddenly felt the fire engine.

20:16.764 --> 20:23.052
I felt my feet on the pedal, and I thought, holy God, I'm in the fire engine again.

20:23.072 --> 20:24.214
And I was in it.

20:24.413 --> 20:36.066
I jumped time, and I was in it, and I thought, he and Nippy, my little dog, and Mr. Bear went down the long alleyway in the sunshine.

20:36.086 --> 20:38.228
The fire bell rang, and a song came out.

20:38.749 --> 20:41.352
This is my first book, a children's book.

20:41.372 --> 20:45.797
And it was a gift from the spirit, I believe.

20:46.518 --> 20:49.321
My grandfather gave me the fire engine.

20:49.341 --> 20:54.066
I was ready to move through the door as a writer, and...

20:54.434 --> 20:56.637
He was then deceased.

20:57.138 --> 21:02.266
I had only his old clock that used to tick in my office.

21:02.286 --> 21:07.654
And I used to put a candle in front of that clock every day and light it for him.

21:07.674 --> 21:08.676
Was it an offering?

21:08.736 --> 21:08.996
Yes.

21:09.277 --> 21:11.861
It was an acknowledgment of an old master.

21:12.642 --> 21:18.771
And he wrapped me in the fire engine and he said, go for it.

21:19.257 --> 21:47.678
and uh i did and i went through that was the beginning and then i had my voice then i knew it's my life it's not the life of juna barn it's not the life of james joyce it's my life and what i've witnessed is now my art you say the voice is there one voice

21:48.012 --> 21:49.976
No, no, no.

21:50.477 --> 21:52.020
These are autonomous.

21:52.040 --> 21:55.587
I was just wondering if these are all part of one voice or are they many voices?

21:55.607 --> 21:59.815
No, the voice that I was describing there was— I understand, but you said something more and I just wanted to clarify that.

21:59.835 --> 22:03.743
Well, no, McShane has got his own voice, Saul Feldman has got his own voice, and I—

22:04.195 --> 22:08.781
These are, you know, Jung would call them autonomous figures in the unconscious.

22:08.901 --> 22:10.423
They are not my ego.

22:10.483 --> 22:11.504
That's the whole idea.

22:11.584 --> 22:15.909
If I were left in my own ego, it wouldn't last very long.

22:15.929 --> 22:17.671
How long could I last in my own ego?

22:17.691 --> 22:19.313
I mean, there's just not enough material there.

22:19.474 --> 22:24.420
And so I started to try and write about a serial killer.

22:25.261 --> 22:30.507
And after about six weeks, the office was filled with energy

22:30.655 --> 22:56.882
man that i did not want any part of because i i'm sensitive to it and i realized what kind of stuff i was pulling in and i don't know where was it coming from it was coming from the the those the world yeah yeah and all the alive dead or alive dead and both and those connoisseurs of that energy those disembodied beings who dig blood sacrifice you know in africa there are some very heavy duty

22:57.284 --> 23:21.435
sacrifice you can read about this it's all around and they get amazing results from blood well the blood in the mind is 10 times more attractive to a certain level of vampire than the blood than you know that's in our veins and you start creating those images and you suck in a lot of weird stuff i don't know if this is true

23:22.090 --> 23:30.861
Maybe this should be off the record, but the guy who runs the San Francisco Review of Books told me that when Anne Rice was writing Interview with a Vampire, her child was dying of leukemia.

23:31.122 --> 23:37.450
Jesus Christ.

23:37.470 --> 23:37.750
Yeah.

23:37.771 --> 23:40.855
I won't put that in, but it's a heck of a... Yeah, isn't it?

23:40.875 --> 23:43.037
I've interviewed Anne Rice before, too.

23:43.057 --> 23:46.562
Do you feel that this is not just entertainment, and this is off the record, then?

23:47.048 --> 23:47.629
Yeah, right.

23:47.889 --> 23:49.812
You feel that it's not just that.

23:49.832 --> 23:50.653
Hell no.

23:50.753 --> 23:52.335
She believes in shit.

23:52.435 --> 23:54.578
No, no, no.

23:54.698 --> 23:56.701
More interestingly, it believes in her.

23:57.502 --> 24:03.610
It has found... I don't mean, it didn't mean classifying as that, using that word.

24:03.890 --> 24:05.473
I know how you feel.

24:05.493 --> 24:11.120
I mean, you're sensitive to good writing, and she can write very well when she wants to.

24:11.140 --> 24:11.861
When she has to.

24:12.181 --> 24:13.343
When she has to.

24:13.829 --> 24:16.832
You've got two full-time secretaries just answer the mail.

24:16.912 --> 24:17.512
Did you know that?

24:18.713 --> 24:27.361
Well, you know, again, that's just proof to me that we are desperate for work of the unknown, about the unknown.

24:28.022 --> 24:37.050
That it would take the form of a vampire just shows how decadent we are and how in need of this kind of thing.

24:37.491 --> 24:42.115
What are you personally willing to believe in and not willing to believe in?

24:43.765 --> 24:59.158
Well, I met a woman in London at the Blavatsky Society, the Theosophical Society, and she said to me, there's only one thing I am able to say.

24:59.639 --> 25:02.101
I know the truth when I see it.

25:02.121 --> 25:12.810
And I've kept that in my mind, and I like to think I know the truth when I see it, that I'm not handing out cheap,

25:13.297 --> 25:16.440
fantasy.

25:17.521 --> 25:20.164
A Reuters news guy said in the other night, it's all fantasy.

25:20.364 --> 25:23.387
He said, every news story I file is a fantasy.

25:23.707 --> 25:26.270
And he said, all the stories we file are fantasies.

25:26.290 --> 25:30.434
The event is one thing, and then what we make about it is this fantasy.

25:31.055 --> 25:35.339
And there are degrees and degrees of this fantasy.

25:35.359 --> 25:38.342
And I like to think that the fantasies I'm shaping are

25:38.828 --> 25:50.659
up the ladder in erudition, in articulation, and that they attract higher energy, and that I'm funneling in stuff that's necessary for connoisseurs of the unknown.

25:54.423 --> 25:59.988
It is said that you have a cult following you, too.

26:00.008 --> 26:01.690
How do you respond to that?

26:01.710 --> 26:05.173
I don't want anybody following me.

26:05.626 --> 26:21.629
I think that if you're a cult novelist, that means you sell a certain amount of copies.

26:21.949 --> 26:26.075
And then when you stop being a cult novelist, you've sold.

26:26.335 --> 26:30.942
And my audience, these people don't buy books, they steal them.

26:31.208 --> 26:34.791
The copies of Fan Man, you never loan it away because you'll never see it again.

26:34.851 --> 26:37.394
I've heard that story so many times.

26:40.096 --> 26:41.798
Have you met Marty Asher?

26:41.818 --> 26:42.439
He's a pretty nice guy.

26:42.459 --> 26:44.460
Yeah, he's a nice guy.

26:44.481 --> 26:45.802
He's got excellent instincts.

26:45.902 --> 26:47.984
And he wrote some funny copy.

26:48.264 --> 26:51.247
His press kit for the Fan Man is funny as hell.

26:51.807 --> 26:54.550
Are you going to tour for that or is this kind of in conjunction with that?

26:54.610 --> 26:55.611
This is in conjunction.

26:55.691 --> 26:57.773
That is, they are riding on the coattails.

26:58.259 --> 26:58.860
That's smart.

26:59.240 --> 27:00.081
Sure, it's smart.

27:00.101 --> 27:04.705
Actually, in my piece, for instance, I'll certainly make mention of Vogue, you know, until you get them both.

27:09.850 --> 27:14.154
You know, I love, of course, being an old newspaper guy, I love the Midnight Examiner.

27:14.174 --> 27:16.677
Yeah.

27:16.697 --> 27:20.581
And, you know, I never realized it was a satire.

27:20.601 --> 27:23.403
Well, yeah, that's right.

27:23.463 --> 27:28.148
And I'm supposed to be a critic, and I said, well, I guess it's a satire.

27:28.482 --> 27:29.263
No, it's not.

27:29.523 --> 27:31.646
It didn't impress me as a sad thing.

27:31.666 --> 27:36.151
No, and you know, the Reuters news guy said to me, I said, have you read Scoop by Evelyn Waugh?

27:36.352 --> 27:37.413
He said, oh yeah, several times.

27:37.433 --> 27:39.035
He said, you know, Waugh wasn't a humorist.

27:39.055 --> 27:40.316
He was a realist.

27:40.517 --> 27:45.823
It's all, Scoop is about newspaper men, and it seems outrageous, but it's not.

27:45.903 --> 27:51.109
My first story for the Midnight Examiner when I worked there was, South American woman gives birth to puppies.

27:52.231 --> 27:52.431
And

27:52.715 --> 27:57.421
We just wrote one story like that after another, and people gobbled it up.

27:57.581 --> 28:00.184
And that's when I realized the power of the printed word.

28:00.524 --> 28:07.833
And I realized how desperate we are for crocodile-headed men and ibis-headed women like the Egyptians had.

28:07.913 --> 28:09.054
They had them.

28:09.074 --> 28:14.581
Their soul was answered by the forms they had on their walls.

28:15.342 --> 28:21.709
We need the forms, but we are again so decadent that the only place we get them are on the front pages of

28:23.157 --> 28:24.479
That fascinates me.

28:24.639 --> 28:26.221
I wonder if you've ever looked at them.

28:26.241 --> 28:34.272
Yale, a couple years ago, published a multi-volume edition of the paintings of Captain Cook's Voyages.

28:34.733 --> 28:41.642
You know, the first, because they didn't have photographs and cameras and stuff, so they took along artists.

28:41.662 --> 28:47.190
And when he did these trips and they saw these animals in Australia and these people in Israel,

28:47.474 --> 28:49.918
what the first impression was.

28:50.498 --> 28:56.788
And you look at some of these, I mean, they really are almost what you think you're seeing, not really what you're seeing.

28:57.168 --> 29:00.233
And I love these first perceptions.

29:00.834 --> 29:07.403
I love the paintings that the first artists did of the American West.

29:07.423 --> 29:16.637
I love those old maps where they, you know, perception and reality, they just... I mean, they're accurate.

29:17.090 --> 29:18.632
I guess.

29:19.773 --> 29:23.857
You know, they're not accurate for our purposes now or to our eye.

29:24.258 --> 29:34.108
But those strange bent Indians, you know, this peculiar way they drew them and the maps, as you say, it was a legitimate perception.

29:34.188 --> 29:36.831
Perceptions always change.

29:37.151 --> 29:37.732
Who's right?

29:37.992 --> 29:39.333
Whose perception is correct?

29:39.914 --> 29:41.155
It's an agreement we have.

29:41.396 --> 29:45.320
We agree on a certain style of perception right now.

29:45.340 --> 29:46.641
And we're lapped inside of it.

29:47.431 --> 29:51.175
You say that you listen to Shakespeare every day?

29:51.195 --> 29:51.535
Every night.

29:51.555 --> 29:52.176
Faithfully.

29:52.857 --> 29:53.357
Never miss.

29:54.098 --> 30:02.707
Is this in lieu of music or is this... No, but I like to go to sleep with the bard because I want him to sink deep inside of me.

30:02.868 --> 30:08.173
I want to get so that those rhythms are just constantly vibrating inside of me.

30:08.253 --> 30:12.558
And when you saturate yourself with it, you're really getting it.

30:12.678 --> 30:14.820
I mean, first of all, you're getting Paul Schofield.

30:14.981 --> 30:17.303
You're getting the best actors of your time.

30:17.435 --> 30:19.817
They add their energy to it, too.

30:20.278 --> 30:25.143
Hearing it is more than reading it, because you're getting written for performance.

30:26.024 --> 30:29.167
And so, to me, I'm trying to reach the Bard.

30:29.407 --> 30:30.688
Let me be honest about it.

30:30.788 --> 30:32.390
I'm reaching out to him.

30:32.830 --> 30:35.293
This is my preparation, my homework.

30:36.354 --> 30:40.818
I have to know it all totally in order to be able to reach out there.

30:40.858 --> 30:45.703
Isn't it extraordinary that we're sitting almost in the exact place where I, ten years ago,

30:46.780 --> 30:54.207
toyed with the idea of writing a novel about bringing Shakespeare back, conjuring him today.

30:54.647 --> 30:57.430
We talked for an hour about things.

30:59.252 --> 30:59.952
And it's lovely.

31:00.253 --> 31:01.994
And it would be in view of those swan boats.

31:02.074 --> 31:11.143
And maybe we would have walked under a, I think maybe we were actually walking to a mulberry tree and you said, where the hell are you going?

31:11.163 --> 31:11.643
Where are you taking me?

31:11.663 --> 31:12.404
You know what I'm saying?

31:12.424 --> 31:16.568
And here we are talking about you're trying to bring him back to

31:17.071 --> 31:41.179
I know when I took a course at Bates in Shakespeare, and this guy is now deceased, but one of the great things he did was to have us at one point in the course, after maybe 15 plays or so, to write 25 lines of blank verse, to take a scene that could have happened, but it's actually off stage.

31:41.660 --> 31:42.741
So you finish it.

31:43.700 --> 31:51.070
You have a minimum of three characters.

31:51.090 --> 31:55.416
The rhythm, all of a sudden, you really are getting this blank verse sense of feeling.

31:55.477 --> 32:00.584
And I'll tell you something that stayed with me for close to 30 years in my own writing.

32:00.604 --> 32:04.009
I mean, you really do have this feeling for rhythms.

32:04.029 --> 32:06.532
And I can pick up a volume of Shakespeare and read it.

32:06.552 --> 32:07.213
I love reading.

32:09.016 --> 32:11.819
I'm impressed enough to see it and to hear it.

32:11.840 --> 32:13.622
But just play with those rhythms.

32:14.176 --> 32:19.864
I absolutely think that it does affect you as a writer at some point.

32:20.204 --> 32:21.145
Oh, yes.

32:21.366 --> 32:26.512
And what I lament is that you can't write that way any longer.

32:26.773 --> 32:33.261
It's too bad, but you can't use those rhythms directly any longer because we don't hear that way.

32:33.381 --> 32:39.550
And beautiful as it is, it can't be reproduced for us.

32:39.790 --> 32:42.073
We cannot reproduce it because we could not...

32:42.357 --> 32:43.979
It couldn't be appreciated.

32:44.059 --> 32:44.859
It just couldn't work.

32:44.960 --> 33:02.197
I'm trying to figure out a way to write a play in poetry, because the sections of Midsummer's Night Dream, the dialogue between Oberon and Titania, I go, I go, look how I go, like the arrow from the something's bow.

33:05.560 --> 33:08.483
I want to write a play that sounds like that.

33:08.918 --> 33:12.041
Can I get a word?

33:12.061 --> 33:15.705
I'd like to think.

33:15.725 --> 33:16.846
Have you written a play?

33:17.347 --> 33:23.614
Yeah, I wrote a play called Joseph of Altoona.

33:23.634 --> 33:38.149
It's about an artist from Manhattan who goes back to Altoona, Pennsylvania to live because he can't stand it any longer and he lives with his mother and she brings in all her friends

33:38.618 --> 33:43.164
They bring in a broken statue of the Madonna and say, do you paint saints?

33:43.865 --> 33:45.327
And ask them to repaint it.

33:46.569 --> 33:50.815
It's the ludicrous position of an artist in a middle-class situation.

33:50.975 --> 33:58.185
I wrote, Django Reinhardt played the blues, and that was staged, there was a reading of that in Manhattan last year.

33:58.966 --> 34:04.393
I've written plays, and I wrote Hair Nightingale as a play, as well as as a book.

34:05.335 --> 34:07.157
But you have to be in...

34:07.576 --> 34:11.141
Manhattan full-time to pull it off.

34:11.281 --> 34:15.346
I don't know how anybody can make a living as a playwright.

34:15.707 --> 34:24.278
You've got to work with a repertory company, and I could do it, and I could be getting stuff put on.

34:24.379 --> 34:29.145
If I moved to L.A., I could be in the movie scene all the time, and I just don't want to.

34:29.952 --> 34:33.796
That was quite a switch, huh, doing a novel from E.T.?

34:33.816 --> 34:36.699
I mean, that's an inversion, isn't it?

34:36.719 --> 34:37.100
Yeah, it is.

34:37.480 --> 34:37.921
I loved it.

34:38.121 --> 34:39.422
Tell me about the challenge of that.

34:39.482 --> 34:40.563
Well, it was great.

34:40.703 --> 34:45.449
First of all, I didn't have to worry about the dialogue and I didn't have to worry about the plot.

34:45.589 --> 34:46.890
That left something open.

34:47.371 --> 34:49.193
It left open E.T.

34:49.213 --> 34:51.215
and everybody else's thought processes.

34:51.875 --> 34:58.963
And what was so much fun is there's a line of dialogue by the mother about how her kids are...

34:59.247 --> 35:01.229
you know, playing Dungeons and Dragons.

35:01.650 --> 35:04.453
And I thought, how does a mother really feel about that?

35:04.913 --> 35:08.056
And I, you know, she feels like an orc.

35:08.197 --> 35:09.138
That's how she feels.

35:09.718 --> 35:12.721
And I was able to put all that humor in and E.T.'

35:12.701 --> 35:16.385
's very sensitive, very far out thought processes.

35:16.405 --> 35:17.847
He's just what I want to be.

35:18.327 --> 35:25.575
I would like to be an extraterrestrial and see I'm working toward it, to come here with total other perception and look at things.

35:26.095 --> 35:30.021
It gave me the opportunity to do one of the things I like to do best.

35:30.041 --> 35:35.089
And I think... You're working towards becoming an extraterrestrial?

35:35.109 --> 35:35.409
Yeah, right.

35:35.549 --> 35:40.397
In other words, becoming non-human, getting rid of all the human model.

35:40.757 --> 35:41.819
Are you actively working?

35:41.879 --> 35:42.360
You bet.

35:42.380 --> 35:49.150
I mean, you talk to trees and have intercourse with your shadow, and you're on the way to being an extraterrestrial.

35:49.906 --> 35:53.231
I always look for the last line of my piece.

35:53.652 --> 35:56.856
I always come to these things looking for my lead and my kicker.

35:57.037 --> 35:58.298
That's great.

35:59.100 --> 36:02.865
He just gave me the last.

36:02.885 --> 36:04.588
So I had a great time with these two.

36:04.668 --> 36:07.392
Would you call it intercourse with your shadow or communion with your shadow?

36:07.412 --> 36:11.298
Well, it's both, really.

36:11.538 --> 36:15.744
I mean, it can be as sensual as intercourse.

36:15.764 --> 36:18.148
My shadow is male, so we better be careful.

36:19.490 --> 36:19.710
But...

36:20.028 --> 36:23.553
That's why I'm asking, giving you a chance to rethink the quote.

36:23.653 --> 36:26.196
Yeah, we better call it communication.

36:28.179 --> 36:33.125
I didn't want to say it quite like that.

36:33.566 --> 36:35.188
I see things in print, by the way.

36:35.308 --> 36:42.598
You know things that people say, you can quote them literally, but they look different.

36:42.618 --> 36:43.960
Have you ever noticed that?

36:43.980 --> 36:44.460
You bet.

36:44.620 --> 36:45.782
When somebody says...

36:46.471 --> 36:50.815
And even if you quote them in context, you say, Jesus, that looks different.

36:51.436 --> 36:55.200
I know I said it, but it looks different from the way I said it.

36:55.500 --> 36:57.322
Have you ever noticed that?

36:57.362 --> 36:57.742
What is that?

36:57.783 --> 37:01.046
Is that something different about the printed word as opposed to the spoken word?

37:01.406 --> 37:04.149
Yeah, they are two different things.

37:04.169 --> 37:07.292
A spoken word is one energy, and a printed word is another.

37:07.432 --> 37:09.775
And that's very distinct.

37:09.895 --> 37:11.116
They're two different muses.

37:11.236 --> 37:13.018
I mean, they're pushed by it.

37:13.606 --> 37:25.697
Somebody was telling me, in fact, a guy that there was actually research done at MIT that, I mean, you write on a word processor, right?

37:25.717 --> 37:28.960
And then do you edit off hard copy or do you edit off the screen?

37:29.381 --> 37:39.330
Because there actually has been research done that you have two different people respond differently to what they read off a page than what they read off a screen.

37:39.710 --> 37:41.892
I know I seem to edit differently off

37:42.412 --> 37:43.914
of hard copy?

37:43.934 --> 37:44.694
Yeah, you do.

37:44.935 --> 37:45.615
So I do both.

37:45.655 --> 37:53.524
I mean, the first... All the... Everything until the last draft is off the screen, and the last draft is on the paper, and then back to the screen.

37:53.544 --> 37:54.625
So you do that.

37:54.885 --> 37:55.806
Back to the screen, yeah.

37:55.846 --> 37:57.468
So you do go to the hard copy, then?

37:57.488 --> 37:59.550
Yeah, but it's primarily on the screen.

37:59.610 --> 38:04.595
But what takes precedence, in your view, in terms of... Because it is going to be read in a book.

38:04.615 --> 38:06.137
Yeah, that's such an interesting question.

38:06.177 --> 38:09.821
I hadn't even thought about it, because the hard copy looks different.

38:09.841 --> 38:11.102
It does, doesn't it, from the screen?

38:12.635 --> 38:19.265
Do you think the book is here forever?

38:19.465 --> 38:23.251
Or do you think that the computer screens are there?

38:23.271 --> 38:24.252
I would lament that.

38:24.973 --> 38:31.042
So would I. So would I. But they've got kids' books now.

38:31.082 --> 38:34.207
The kid can read it in English, press a button, hear it in Spanish.

38:35.990 --> 38:41.578
That is going to make for a wonderfully well-rounded human being.

38:42.672 --> 38:47.499
I'm not going to ask you questions that are answered in so many of those, I guess, certainly which are obvious.

38:48.380 --> 38:50.102
You do swim in the ocean, I guess.

38:50.303 --> 38:50.783
Yeah.

38:50.924 --> 38:52.045
In my wetsuit.

38:52.065 --> 38:52.746
In that ocean.

38:52.926 --> 38:53.587
Yeah.

38:53.607 --> 39:01.879
I need a wetsuit, but last year when I was swimming, I saw this body floating toward me, and it turned out to be a decapitated seal, and I thought,

39:02.197 --> 39:05.521
What takes the heads off seals and killer whales?

39:05.661 --> 39:06.142
Killer whales.

39:06.162 --> 39:13.390
And then I remembered the lobster man told me that he had found decapitated seals on one of the islands washed up and that the killer whales just like to eat the head.

39:13.410 --> 39:17.796
And I thought, how does the whale know the difference between the seal and the novelist?

39:18.437 --> 39:18.717
I know.

39:19.398 --> 39:21.380
Well, the novelists supposedly look the same.

39:21.680 --> 39:28.328
That was one of the things about people on floats, why they're attacked by sharks.

39:28.388 --> 39:32.153
I mean, they really have a profile that is...

39:32.842 --> 39:34.304
Who knows what a white shark thinks?

39:34.484 --> 39:38.190
I'm not going to take up too much of your time, sir.

39:38.210 --> 39:42.937
You've got plenty of good stuff.

39:42.997 --> 39:48.986
Is there anything that you see that does tie the body of your work together?

39:49.066 --> 39:50.108
Is it a corpus?

39:51.303 --> 39:54.586
Or is it just a movable piece?

39:54.606 --> 39:58.190
Is it something that's new all the time, or is there?

39:58.210 --> 40:06.539
You did say that you're striving to be an extraterrestrial, and I wonder if everything you do is a further step along the way to achieving that.

40:06.699 --> 40:07.740
Yes, I would say so.

40:07.760 --> 40:08.701
You would say that?

40:09.642 --> 40:16.029
Yeah, because then that maybe is why all of the books are different, because if I kept repeating, I couldn't make it.

40:16.049 --> 40:18.692
Well, it's an exploration for you as much as it is for the reader.

40:18.712 --> 40:19.673
Is that right?

40:19.855 --> 40:23.500
I'm the extraterrestrial wandering around in this strange landscape.

40:24.441 --> 40:27.505
And each book is another facet of the landscape.

40:27.525 --> 40:29.107
Do you know precisely where you're going?

40:29.167 --> 40:31.110
I mean, these are cliche questions.

40:31.190 --> 40:33.212
The next book I know precisely where I'm going.

40:33.232 --> 40:36.677
It's about a bear who becomes a best-selling novelist and goes on tour.

40:37.057 --> 40:38.239
Watch out for John Irving.

40:38.339 --> 40:39.761
I thought he had a corner on bears.

40:40.241 --> 40:41.363
Yeah, you'll find out.

40:41.383 --> 40:43.926
He did four novels on bears.

40:43.946 --> 40:44.887
It's a true story.

40:45.708 --> 40:47.010
My wife is a novelist.

40:47.547 --> 40:51.252
And we had a house burned down, and all of our manuscripts were lost.

40:51.332 --> 40:53.995
So when we rebuilt our house... Oh, that's rough.

40:54.035 --> 40:54.656
That's rough.

40:54.676 --> 40:59.923
When we rebuilt, we made damn sure that our manuscripts weren't lost.

40:59.943 --> 41:07.032
So she would put hers in a portfolio, an artist's portfolio, and hide it under a spruce tree far from the house every day.

41:07.052 --> 41:09.875
And then we'd go into town to get our laundry and so forth.

41:10.776 --> 41:13.740
We come back one day, and the portfolio is gone.

41:15.037 --> 41:23.966
I go straight over to the old lumberjack, who was our mentor there, and I walk in and he's sitting by the stove, looking into the stove as usual.

41:24.347 --> 41:25.728
His son is sitting there like this.

41:26.149 --> 41:30.113
I walk in and I say, an animal has taken Elizabeth's portfolio.

41:30.613 --> 41:35.639
He just stands up, takes his hat off the hook, puts it on, and walks out the door.

41:36.059 --> 41:38.361
He doesn't even ask what a portfolio is.

41:39.282 --> 41:44.588
So he'd go over there, go under the tree, he sniffs around, he said, a bear's got it.

41:45.209 --> 41:50.758
Elizabeth just collapsed on the ground, and he said, spread out.

41:51.619 --> 41:54.604
That bear could be in the next county, but spread out.

41:55.265 --> 42:04.400
So we spread out down in the woods about 100 yards, and I hear his son calling, what color is that bear, poor fleo?

42:05.662 --> 42:06.563
What color is it?

42:07.044 --> 42:08.426
How many colors are there?

42:08.446 --> 42:10.710
How many of these must be in the main woods, too?

42:10.730 --> 42:12.212
So we go over there.

42:12.682 --> 42:15.486
There are teeth marks on the handle of the portfolio.

42:15.506 --> 42:17.409
There are claw marks on the side of it.

42:17.609 --> 42:20.954
And, you know, he tossed it around to see if there was anything edible in it.

42:21.515 --> 42:25.982
So my novel, Or She, opens up the same way.

42:26.723 --> 42:28.866
The bear... Well, the sex is important.

42:28.886 --> 42:29.427
Yeah.

42:29.447 --> 42:33.132
Certainly in the creative... Yeah, it's a male bear in the story.

42:34.073 --> 42:35.035
He opens it up.

42:35.055 --> 42:35.976
It's not a pie.

42:36.497 --> 42:37.779
It's just termite food.

42:37.819 --> 42:38.380
It's paper.

42:38.900 --> 42:40.062
But he starts to read it.

42:40.102 --> 42:40.663
He said...

42:40.947 --> 42:41.808
This isn't bad.

42:43.890 --> 42:45.171
Is this in the book?

42:45.191 --> 42:46.893
This is in the book, yeah.

42:46.913 --> 42:51.077
And the next scene is him in the office of a New York literary agent.

42:51.097 --> 42:52.599
Is this a children's book?

42:52.679 --> 42:54.060
No, this is an adult book.

42:55.041 --> 42:57.383
And this book is about perception.

42:57.504 --> 43:05.492
And its message is, it doesn't matter who or what you are.

43:05.552 --> 43:07.534
It's the product.

43:08.395 --> 43:08.895
And they...

43:09.128 --> 43:11.873
They just seem, he's a Hemingway-like character.

43:11.973 --> 43:13.015
He's a big, tough guy.

43:13.035 --> 43:17.903
He's a hairy son of a bitch, right.

43:17.923 --> 43:18.324
All right.

43:18.344 --> 43:20.507
Remember, what was Bud Schulberg's line?

43:20.547 --> 43:25.235
I mean, you put a gorilla in a tuxedo, but you can't take him to a ballroom dance.

43:25.255 --> 43:27.499
This is just the opposite of that, isn't it?

43:27.519 --> 43:29.082
Yeah, that's right.

43:29.122 --> 43:29.703
That's right.

43:29.863 --> 43:31.626
And the literary agent says to him,

43:32.213 --> 43:35.057
You know, you really do remind me of Hemingway.

43:35.157 --> 43:36.218
And the bear says, who?

43:36.699 --> 43:37.960
And he says, who indeed?

43:38.060 --> 43:38.761
Yes, of course.

43:38.801 --> 43:40.724
You'll take his place.

43:46.110 --> 43:47.552
Listen, would you inscribe this book?

43:47.572 --> 43:48.093
You bet.

43:48.934 --> 43:50.195
Ed, do you need a pen?

43:50.335 --> 43:51.176
I got a pen.

43:51.317 --> 43:52.899
I'm sure it's a writing.

43:52.999 --> 43:55.842
It's N-I-C-K.

43:56.343 --> 43:58.025
I have a friend who spells it N-I-K.

43:58.145 --> 44:00.047
Oh, or some also do it.

44:00.088 --> 44:01.309
N-I-C, I guess.

44:03.500 --> 44:04.261
That was good.

44:05.682 --> 44:06.263
That again?

44:06.463 --> 44:06.784
Yeah.

44:06.884 --> 44:12.290
It's called The Geography of Nowhere, and it's about how we live in the geography of nowhere.

44:12.310 --> 44:22.742
We used to have neighborhoods, but as soon as they made cars, the Portland Cement Company and the Standard Oil and the rest of them wanted the society to be cars.

44:23.563 --> 44:31.532
And the integration of people, poor people with better...

44:32.137 --> 44:33.799
people with a little more income, ceased.

44:34.199 --> 44:38.003
The rich people live out in the suburbs, the poor people live in the ghettos.

44:38.223 --> 44:39.485
It ghettoized our culture.

44:39.845 --> 44:43.069
You go through suburbia now, there are no sidewalks, there are just roads.

44:43.089 --> 44:43.829
No, it must be his.

44:43.910 --> 44:46.632
No sidewalks and no streetlights.

44:46.973 --> 44:48.575
Which is nice.

44:48.595 --> 44:49.896
You've got little kids.

44:50.176 --> 44:54.261
And we've made a landscape of hell.

44:54.981 --> 44:58.045
It's just amazing.

44:58.065 --> 44:59.486
Look at his tail.

44:59.506 --> 45:00.287
Yeah, he's had a strange little...
