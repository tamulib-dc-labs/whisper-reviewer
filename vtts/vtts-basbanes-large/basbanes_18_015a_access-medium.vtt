WEBVTT

00:01.583 --> 00:02.264
We're running.

00:03.125 --> 00:04.847
So, Charlie Smith, nice to talk to you.

00:05.769 --> 00:07.070
Congratulations on another book.

00:09.834 --> 00:09.974
Thanks.

00:09.994 --> 00:12.578
Why don't we just enter this conversation at some point?

00:12.598 --> 00:19.968
I read a PW interview with you, I guess, in 93 when you finished Chimney Rock.

00:20.028 --> 00:25.195
And I guess that piece you recorded is saying that you saw that as the final...

00:25.175 --> 00:28.581
installment in a kind of spiritual trilogy.

00:29.883 --> 00:39.099
And I wonder if you still feel that way, and then what you see this novel as beginning, or why don't we enter it that way?

00:40.021 --> 00:40.983
Yeah.

00:41.003 --> 00:42.846
Well, I guess you could say that

00:43.366 --> 00:45.208
Yeah, sure, I still see it that way.

00:45.648 --> 00:47.270
I hadn't thought of it for a long time.

00:48.992 --> 01:04.188
Of that spiritual trilogy, it's hard even to explain what I meant by that, but I certainly see this new book as a beginning of something else.

01:04.208 --> 01:10.335
Somehow, it seemed like in earlier books that I had these characters who were...

01:10.315 --> 01:21.130
kind of violently and obsessively groping through the world, trying to find something to sustain them, trying to shed something and then find something else.

01:21.771 --> 01:25.617
And a lot of times, I think in general, they didn't really find it.

01:25.637 --> 01:34.990
I mean, if there was any tragic dimension to them at all, it was simply that they knew they didn't find it.

01:35.257 --> 01:37.442
I see a lot of that in this book, too, though.

01:37.782 --> 01:41.831
Yeah, but I think in this book there's another side to it.

01:42.031 --> 01:47.563
For one thing, in this book you have, once again, violent, murderous characters.

01:47.603 --> 01:50.449
These are real criminals, not kind of romantic criminals.

01:51.050 --> 01:52.253
But at the same time...

01:52.655 --> 02:07.576
They're both capable of a very kind of complex and sustaining love between them, which is never really in any way adulterated or diminished.

02:07.596 --> 02:16.468
And also I think that at least Jack and his kind of maniac relationship

02:17.832 --> 02:27.209
disheveled, groping around for some sense of a larger dimension, is able to in fact come on something like that.

02:29.834 --> 02:34.442
Do you start with characters here or do you start with a theme or story?

02:34.463 --> 02:35.284
I'm curious.

02:36.023 --> 02:37.264
No, I just start.

02:38.446 --> 02:48.277
Often, I'm trying to think about, like, this book is a book that I began back in 1989.

02:48.637 --> 02:53.142
I wrote about 100 pages of it at that time.

02:53.622 --> 03:02.432
It was a different version, but it was, I guess what I got a picture of was, back in 89, generally this is how books start for me.

03:02.452 --> 03:05.035
I got a picture of this married couple

03:05.318 --> 03:20.407
having breakfast in a cafe, quietly having breakfast in a western or midwestern cafe in a small town, and just conversing quietly, and then getting up, leaving the cafe, and robbing the local bank.

03:21.690 --> 03:23.473
This was just a picture that was in my mind.

03:23.513 --> 03:26.078
I really liked the contrast, the

03:26.463 --> 03:47.546
the smallest of the town, this kind of empty western landscape, the married couple just conversing about the meal, not talking about anything except what they were doing and then getting up without really even, the way I originally pictured it was that they went out and robbed the bank without ever mentioning that that was what they were doing.

03:47.566 --> 03:55.575
They just continued their conversation about whatever it was they were talking about, the past or where they wanted to go on vacation next year, this kind of thing.

03:55.943 --> 04:03.624
And in the midst of this running conversation, rob the bank, flee, and are eventually forced into this fire.

04:04.286 --> 04:06.713
That was the original version of it.

04:07.739 --> 04:09.962
What was this expressing for you?

04:10.043 --> 04:27.570
I mean, this certainly is kind of a... I'm trying to find the right description here, but your feelings about where the heck we're going in terms of our morals and the indifference with which we... Well, I don't really...

04:27.550 --> 04:29.793
ask myself, what is this expressing?

04:29.813 --> 04:31.796
I mean, I'm just interested in telling the story.

04:32.637 --> 04:35.622
And I like to get something rolling and see what happens.

04:36.463 --> 04:39.207
I don't plan ahead in stories.

04:39.307 --> 04:40.729
I don't outline.

04:40.789 --> 04:41.991
I don't figure things out.

04:42.352 --> 04:50.984
I don't feel like I have any obligation to, you know, to kind of improve the moral character of the country or anything like that.

04:51.004 --> 04:53.808
I mean, they're moralists and preachers enough for that.

04:54.249 --> 04:56.292
What I have an obligation to is to

04:56.778 --> 05:03.550
you know, is to kind of release the imagination in this formal manner that we call a novel and see what happens.

05:03.891 --> 05:10.422
And figure that that in itself is an expression of the time we live in and, you know, kind of life as it's going on.

05:10.582 --> 05:13.227
Now, you introduced the word tragedy earlier.

05:13.287 --> 05:16.693
And do you see these...

05:17.011 --> 05:30.906
Do you see this, number one, as a tragedy, and do you see these characters as tragic characters, you know, with... I'm not so sure I see... In the classical sense, because then we have to have some tragic... We have to have some really decent qualities here, I guess.

05:30.926 --> 05:34.289
You know, to be a tragic figure, you have to be a decent person to fall, I guess.

05:34.430 --> 05:36.051
I guess.

05:36.111 --> 05:38.314
I mean, I'm not... Yeah, I suppose so.

05:39.135 --> 05:41.998
I mean, I guess you have to have some kind of decency.

05:42.018 --> 05:44.200
I mean, I tend to see it as somebody...

05:44.180 --> 05:51.507
You know, it's a simple definition of just a character who winds up a loser but knows why he's losing.

05:52.488 --> 05:53.589
But knows why he's losing.

05:53.609 --> 05:53.849
Right.

05:53.929 --> 05:59.234
I mean, that's the difference between, say, a pathetic character who loses without knowing why he's losing.

05:59.254 --> 06:07.641
Did you have a sense when you're writing these, when you're writing your fiction or even your poetry, we should talk about, too, I mean, who you're writing for, who your audience is?

06:08.782 --> 06:10.424
I'm my audience.

06:10.444 --> 06:11.265
You're writing for yourself.

06:11.965 --> 06:12.205
Right.

06:12.225 --> 06:13.967
I'm writing to have something good to read.

06:15.027 --> 06:17.830
But, I mean, you don't visualize a reader out there.

06:18.471 --> 06:18.691
No.

06:18.972 --> 06:20.273
I mean, how would I know about that?

06:20.614 --> 06:21.455
Well, you'd hear from them.

06:21.695 --> 06:24.178
But you'd have a sense of who's reading your books, certainly.

06:24.859 --> 06:25.880
Well, maybe.

06:25.980 --> 06:27.322
I mean, I really, I don't know.

06:27.342 --> 06:29.044
I mean, that's real life.

06:29.144 --> 06:32.608
And, I mean, I don't really have any idea what goes on in people's heads.

06:32.708 --> 06:35.371
And, I mean, I get, you know, information from readers.

06:35.471 --> 06:40.157
And, you know, it's always nice to have people get moved by my books.

06:40.238 --> 06:43.022
But that's not really my interest.

06:43.042 --> 06:49.269
I'm really interested in writing something that really charges my batteries.

06:49.410 --> 06:51.652
It really makes me think it's great.

06:51.973 --> 07:00.103
Now, where you, and then you've already touched on it, and where you suggested in that PW interview that...

07:00.539 --> 07:03.622
that previous novel was part of a trilogy.

07:04.062 --> 07:10.308
So clearly you are thinking in terms of a corpus of work then, or that all these little... Yeah, yeah.

07:10.409 --> 07:21.639
It's kind of like after the fact, though, is really what it... You know, I mean, it's like... I mean, I may write something and then I look back at it and say, well, maybe this kind of seems to fit with something else.

07:22.120 --> 07:26.744
I don't really have that sense too much, you know, as I begin.

07:26.764 --> 07:29.567
I mean, I tend to be...

07:30.087 --> 07:40.917
You know, I mean, if you have this kind of spectrum of intention in art, where you have on the one hand, I have a friend who does nothing but outline.

07:41.297 --> 07:48.744
He just creates a series of, an increasingly complex series of outlines until his final outline is the actual book.

07:49.745 --> 07:59.554
And I'm kind of all the way at the other end, in which I don't really know what sentence is coming next, much less what event or...

07:59.855 --> 08:01.216
occurrence or anything like that.

08:01.557 --> 08:04.059
It often causes me a lot of problems.

08:04.079 --> 08:07.283
I write myself into dead ends, which is what happened with this book.

08:07.303 --> 08:14.530
I started it in 89, got about 100 pages done, and couldn't figure out what to do next and put it aside for several years.

08:14.630 --> 08:16.833
Wrote several other books in the meantime.

08:17.633 --> 08:19.295
And did you pick up where you left off?

08:20.556 --> 08:20.917
Yeah.

08:21.257 --> 08:27.904
I mean, I did pick up in terms of the timeline of the book.

08:28.238 --> 08:31.643
You know, where I left off, I mean, it's been rewritten several times.

08:31.984 --> 08:38.014
Originally, most of the first hundred pages took place in prison.

08:39.596 --> 08:46.247
I mean, it gave the life of Jack Baker in federal prison.

08:46.531 --> 08:55.885
When I revised an eventual final revision of it, I took most of that out, except in this kind of real selective way.

08:57.387 --> 09:05.680
And we both have the same editor, and I read your comments on Alan Peacock, and I couldn't agree with you more.

09:06.801 --> 09:16.015
What was Alan's role, I mean, beyond being the Good Shepherd and seeing this through the press and doing it well, not only doing it, but doing it well?

09:15.995 --> 09:20.180
What's your relationship with your editor?

09:20.240 --> 09:23.724
Now, I'm not a fiction writer, so I'm curious.

09:23.944 --> 09:24.985
Let's say it's flexible.

09:25.025 --> 09:27.748
I mean, time has passed.

09:27.768 --> 09:32.213
I was in my editor, I guess, about 10 years or something, and we've done several books together.

09:32.233 --> 09:34.075
Some he's liked better than others.

09:35.157 --> 09:37.199
Some have been more difficult than others.

09:37.259 --> 09:39.121
This one was a real difficult book.

09:39.922 --> 09:44.247
This book has had the most difficult birth of any book.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.854
He didn't really like the first version of it.

09:47.555 --> 09:51.822
And he held it for a very long time.

09:52.003 --> 09:52.884
That's Alan's way.

09:53.746 --> 09:53.846
Yeah.

09:53.866 --> 09:56.611
And it was too long for me.

09:57.572 --> 10:01.459
And so we had some conflict about that.

10:01.928 --> 10:11.268
The thing is, I like revising and I like the whole business of working on books.

10:12.090 --> 10:21.169
And so I wound up taking the book back and really kind of creating another version of it.

10:21.689 --> 10:24.153
Because of his reaction to it?

10:24.293 --> 10:26.636
Were you agreeing with him or what?

10:26.676 --> 10:37.111
The best way to deal with the problem that he was bringing up as far as he saw the book, I don't really like to revise in the sense like I tinker with the sentence or something like that.

10:37.472 --> 10:39.795
What I like to do is just reimagine.

10:39.815 --> 10:44.642
I mean, these acts of imagination really are the only thing that are interesting to me about this work.

10:45.010 --> 10:55.008
And so what I like to do is just instead of, say, there's a bank robbery scene and let me try to revise this, just throw that scene out and write another one.

10:55.028 --> 11:02.682
And that tends to be the way I, you might say, revise or rework book, is that I just throw stuff out and write some more stuff.

11:03.168 --> 11:04.810
Let's probe that a bit.

11:04.830 --> 11:05.390
I like that.

11:05.470 --> 11:11.997
You say what really captures you most about this whole process is the act of imagination.

11:13.038 --> 11:16.001
Can you articulate that at all a little bit, what happens?

11:16.081 --> 11:29.175
Imagination is the ability to perceive the unacknowledged correspondences between disparate things.

11:29.392 --> 11:33.396
In other words, it's the ability to see how things that don't seem to be alike are in fact alike.

11:34.177 --> 11:35.278
But do you see them visually?

11:35.498 --> 11:37.080
Do you see them in terms of words?

11:37.120 --> 11:39.543
It doesn't have to be visual or anything.

11:39.563 --> 11:45.229
It can be two words, feelings, concepts, ideas, notions, people, anything.

11:45.929 --> 11:51.395
Imagination is the ability to see how things that don't appear to be alike are in fact alike.

11:51.676 --> 11:54.418
My love is like the deep blue sea.

11:54.559 --> 11:56.841
That's what imagination is as far as I'm concerned.

11:56.861 --> 11:57.762
It's that ability.

11:58.231 --> 12:08.000
And that's the ability that artists have, and that what a work of art is, is a formal structure whereby these acts are in place.

12:09.906 --> 12:13.135
And for some reason, this ability, this quality,

12:13.351 --> 12:32.811
is incredibly fascinating sustaining and enlivening to human beings i mean we go for it whether it's listening to country music or you know or thinking how a mosquito is like a hawk or whatever it might be we're just you know our socks get knocked off by this stuff i mean a guy hitting a ball with a bat i mean it's like a pure

12:32.791 --> 12:38.741
Act of imagination, you know, that sudden kind of application of force going from one direction to the next.

12:39.342 --> 12:42.467
Wham, you know, suddenly it's like our spirits are in the air.

12:42.948 --> 12:47.796
These kinds of things, you know, dazzle and beguile us, and it's what we live for.

12:48.817 --> 12:50.680
Is it something you can conjure up?

12:50.701 --> 12:54.286
Just kind of turn on the tap.

12:54.306 --> 12:54.647
Really?

12:55.336 --> 13:01.787
Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of work involved, a lot of labor, but it's an ability I have.

13:01.827 --> 13:06.474
I wouldn't be doing this kind of work if I didn't have a gift for it.

13:06.534 --> 13:18.634
It seems like to me that the two things necessary for success as an artist, that is to say success being creating a living art object, is talent and drive.

13:19.716 --> 13:20.938
And you've got to have both of them.

13:21.290 --> 13:23.612
Now you write a lot of poetry as well.

13:23.853 --> 13:34.744
Are you able to go to work on fiction today and then turn on the tap to use your image tomorrow and pick up on the poem?

13:36.746 --> 13:39.489
I don't really do it quite that way anymore.

13:39.509 --> 13:44.554
Originally, I used to just slap back and forth between them.

13:45.635 --> 13:50.200
I jerk one page out of the typewriter, jam another one in and change, you know,

13:50.551 --> 13:52.894
from poetry to fiction like that.

13:53.475 --> 13:55.277
But now I don't really do it that way.

13:55.317 --> 13:56.519
It takes the transition.

13:56.559 --> 13:58.702
I stay with one a whole lot longer.

14:00.184 --> 14:03.508
You know, I mean, I may work on fiction for a year.

14:03.568 --> 14:05.451
I had two working on this book.

14:05.471 --> 14:09.176
I was in fiction for a year without getting to write any points.

14:09.276 --> 14:13.842
And then I try to, as soon as I finish a bit of fiction, have a break.

14:14.362 --> 14:17.126
spend an extended period of time writing poems.

14:17.306 --> 14:22.192
I mean, I don't consider myself to be more one side of the street than the other.

14:23.033 --> 14:24.855
Both work is just as serious to me.

14:24.875 --> 14:27.198
But what would you consider the more demanding?

14:28.600 --> 14:31.384
I consider them both about as demanding as I can stand.

14:31.904 --> 14:32.205
Really?

14:33.106 --> 14:33.206
Yeah.

14:33.226 --> 14:37.011
I mean, certainly among many of the novelists I've interviewed over the years,

14:37.514 --> 14:40.480
You know, you talk to them, like somebody like Updike, for instance.

14:40.580 --> 14:44.267
I mean, he craves recognition as a poet, you know.

14:44.647 --> 14:48.715
They would consider the poetry by far the more demanding calling.

14:49.076 --> 14:50.118
Would you agree with that?

14:50.198 --> 14:53.404
No, I consider them both equally demanding.

14:54.025 --> 14:59.375
I mean, you know, my life as a poet and a novelist are very separate lives.

14:59.455 --> 15:00.838
I have two different publishers.

15:01.460 --> 15:06.845
I've always kind of done it that way, where I just have completely separate life.

15:06.885 --> 15:13.311
There are many people who know me as a poet who aren't aware I write fiction, and vice versa.

15:14.012 --> 15:18.936
And that's the way I've always kept it from the beginning, entirely separate worlds, separate lives.

15:19.016 --> 15:22.740
I mean, as time goes on, people become aware of it.

15:22.900 --> 15:28.345
But, you know, I don't see myself as a novelist who writes poems.

15:28.645 --> 15:30.168
or a poet who writes novels.

15:30.248 --> 15:33.453
I see myself as a novelist and as a poet.

15:33.473 --> 15:40.706
Both requiring equally, but nonetheless different skills, I would guess.

15:40.726 --> 15:47.197
Yeah, different skills, but I don't see how one could be less difficult than the other.

15:47.357 --> 15:51.244
It's like you may have more of a gift for one than the other,

15:51.747 --> 15:56.934
I mean, I think that's what Updike's problem is, is that he's got more of a gift for one than the other.

15:57.294 --> 15:57.975
I think you're right.

15:58.336 --> 16:00.799
And so he kind of wishes he was a good poet.

16:01.540 --> 16:03.242
And there are a lot of novelists like that.

16:03.302 --> 16:08.409
There are a lot of novelists who churn out books and poems, and they really wish they were good poets.

16:08.429 --> 16:16.519
But what they are is novelists, you know, laboring really hard, you know, to try to cobble together something that looks like a poem.

16:17.420 --> 16:19.122
That's not what I'm really talking about.

16:19.142 --> 16:20.404
I mean...

16:21.312 --> 16:24.176
I don't think I would write poems if it was that way for me.

16:24.777 --> 16:28.543
I'm not a novelist who has an interest in trying to write some poems.

16:30.166 --> 16:31.708
I'm a poet who writes poems.

16:32.710 --> 16:35.995
And when you're a novelist, you're a novelist writing novels, I guess.

16:36.035 --> 16:39.039
They're separate.

16:39.660 --> 16:49.075
Do you feel that the skills that you have in one discipline influence in any way what you do in the other?

16:49.544 --> 16:53.570
Yeah, I guess I do to a certain extent.

16:54.611 --> 17:00.599
I mean, in the sense that you want to get help from any place you can get it, you know, any place.

17:00.800 --> 17:07.789
And, you know, with poetry, there's such a focus, an intense focus on language itself.

17:07.870 --> 17:15.400
I mean, it's almost like, you know, kind of squeezing words until they, you know, crack into diamonds that,

17:15.683 --> 17:20.352
you know, that kind of intensity to a certain degree can be brought to bear in fiction if you want to.

17:21.333 --> 17:22.616
And I've used it.

17:22.636 --> 17:38.485
I mean, there's, you know, with poetry, there's a certain kind of syntax, there's a certain kind of rhythm and a certain kind of tone that fits in a poem that you become able to use, whereas fiction rhythms and...

17:38.802 --> 17:41.467
syntax are a different kind of matter.

17:41.527 --> 17:44.112
They're much more ordinary, generally.

17:44.933 --> 18:00.000
You know, if a fiction writer does, you know, a couple of, you know, has a couple of syntactical, you know, tricks going in a novel, it's like he'll have two and he'll repeat them, you know, all the way through the novel, like something like Dr. O did in

18:00.402 --> 18:02.045
that book about the gangster.

18:02.386 --> 18:03.589
Billy Bascade?

18:03.609 --> 18:05.132
Yeah, he used these run-on paragraphs.

18:05.212 --> 18:11.826
It was like he figured out this syntactical trick, and it was so exciting to him that he did it a hundred times, you know.

18:12.187 --> 18:17.458
Well, a poet would do something like that eight times in one line.

18:18.280 --> 18:18.360
Hmm.

18:18.830 --> 18:27.485
A poem will require something like that, a kind of syntactical movement or a surge of some kind.

18:27.886 --> 18:37.923
Well, as a poet, you get used to pursuing language and pursuing a movement through a line of thought with that kind of intensity.

18:38.484 --> 18:41.850
And to some degree, that can be brought into a fiction.

18:42.271 --> 18:44.314
And to some degree, I intend...

18:44.868 --> 18:58.924
I try to bring that into fiction, at the same time remembering that, you know, the basic requirements in novel writing, I mean, the two basic requirements are to, you know, move the story deep in the character of both.

19:00.005 --> 19:02.508
And, you know, that that's what's going on always.

19:03.649 --> 19:12.799
Of course, you know, the poet, I would think that the expression, the imagery is something that you're going to find

19:12.779 --> 19:20.494
There are a lot of novelists who couldn't articulate an image if their lives depended on it.

19:20.514 --> 19:31.294
I really think that your work and your poetry certainly must have an influence in that respect, beyond the language that you use.

19:31.274 --> 19:42.013
If we could talk a little bit about your southern, do you see yourself writing in any kind of particular tradition?

19:43.776 --> 19:54.835
I do have a number of southern newspapers that take my features, and some Midwestern ones as well, so I'd be happy to work in a few of these regions here as best we could.

19:54.815 --> 19:58.882
I mean, I'll tell you some of the papers I'm in.

19:58.902 --> 20:00.204
I'm in Jackson, Mississippi.

20:00.224 --> 20:02.087
I'm in Wichita, Kansas.

20:02.187 --> 20:05.733
I'm in Knoxville and Gainesville and Charlottesville.

20:06.995 --> 20:14.066
And I'm in Toledo, of all places, Columbus, Austin, and a few places out in the West, Eugene, Oregon, Salt Lake City.

20:14.086 --> 20:15.709
So, you know, I'm happy.

20:15.689 --> 20:24.727
If we can talk a little bit, I mean, you certainly have touched on a lot of regions where you've lived and where you've visited, where you're from, and certainly the things you write about.

20:24.747 --> 20:26.851
You know, take it anywhere you want.

20:27.453 --> 20:35.689
You did talk about the influence of Faulkner and Hemingway, or a lack thereof in that PW piece, and I did find that fascinating, and I wonder...

20:35.669 --> 20:39.996
Yeah, sure.

20:40.036 --> 20:48.029
I mean, I'm Southern born and bred, and that's powerful and important to me.

20:48.049 --> 20:49.231
I've lived in the Midwest.

20:50.934 --> 20:51.915
And where in particular?

20:52.076 --> 20:52.657
In Iowa.

20:53.438 --> 20:53.919
Uh-huh.

20:53.939 --> 20:55.922
Des Moines takes me, you see.

20:56.358 --> 21:00.604
Actually, you studied at the Writers' Workshop there, isn't it?

21:00.624 --> 21:00.965
Right, yeah.

21:01.486 --> 21:02.227
What year was that?

21:03.168 --> 21:04.711
I was there around 1980.

21:05.031 --> 21:05.432
Okay.

21:06.153 --> 21:06.513
So go ahead.

21:06.533 --> 21:07.315
I'm sorry I interrupted.

21:07.755 --> 21:08.396
Yeah.

21:08.737 --> 21:19.393
You know, and so I have, certainly, I mean, there's no way to not, I mean, if you're born a Southerner, it seems like to me it's hard for there to be any way to not be a Southerner.

21:20.274 --> 21:22.197
You know, it's like being born in Italy.

21:23.122 --> 21:23.923
something like that.

21:24.303 --> 21:26.766
And it affects your life.

21:27.267 --> 21:32.934
As an artist, I can't say that I have any interest in pushing anything that would be called a Southern agenda.

21:34.736 --> 21:45.248
You know, I mean, and it's hard to know, you know, what, I mean, I think when people think of Southern, they think of Faulkner, you know, like Southern writers.

21:45.616 --> 21:48.802
I mean, they tend to think of somebody like Faulkner or something.

21:48.822 --> 21:51.005
Or Eudora Welty, perhaps.

21:51.045 --> 21:53.149
Yeah, maybe Eudora Welty.

21:53.590 --> 22:08.215
But, I mean, I think in a way what they're thinking of as Southern is they're thinking of the styles of individual artists as much as anything, you know, great geniuses.

22:08.617 --> 22:15.704
You know, I mean, Faulkner was a great genius, and Flannery O'Connor was one, and Eudora Welty.

22:15.724 --> 22:27.274
And these are artists with a voice so powerful and deep and singular that it seems to be representative of a whole kind of ethos.

22:27.294 --> 22:31.298
When really it's representative, I think, of these people's genius.

22:31.318 --> 22:37.864
You know, of their kind of, the penetration of their imagination into the heart of life.

22:38.738 --> 22:51.758
And sure, they used certain, you know, utensils, you know, certain, you know, glitter and fencing that they picked up in the particular region they lived in.

22:51.778 --> 22:54.522
But I don't think that business was particularly important.

22:54.562 --> 23:07.041
I think that, you know, if Eudora Welty or Faulkner or Plannery O'Connor had been raised in, you know, Nebraska or, you know, Kansas or something like that, then we would be talking about, you know, do you think of yourself as a,

23:07.358 --> 23:11.983
you know, a Kansas novelist or something like that, simply because that's where the genius is collected.

23:13.185 --> 23:19.572
And, you know, I'm not that interested in something that would be called a kind of southern writing or anything like that.

23:19.613 --> 23:31.847
What I'm interested in is trying to, you know, let my imagination take me as far as it will and take the reader as far as it will take him.

23:32.536 --> 23:38.366
And there are certain Southern things that have been useful because they're close at hand.

23:38.927 --> 23:40.830
I haven't lived in the South a long time.

23:41.671 --> 23:49.464
My last novels, last couple of novels, well actually last three novels have been the main characters have not been Southerners.

23:50.085 --> 23:53.751
The last two have not taken place in the South.

23:54.170 --> 23:56.692
Well, that's a matter of setting.

23:56.733 --> 23:58.114
I mean, that could be argued any way.

23:58.254 --> 23:59.175
Right, yeah.

23:59.235 --> 24:01.597
I wouldn't say that that's any kind of rejection of the South.

24:02.078 --> 24:08.404
It's just that particular utensils and artifacts of the story that came with the story didn't happen to be Southern.

24:08.504 --> 24:18.955
I mean, Jack Baker is born in Duluth, Minnesota, and the novel before the main character was born in Hollywood, and the novel before the main character was born in St.

24:18.995 --> 24:19.435
Louis.

24:20.393 --> 24:25.119
But there does seem to be a consistent kind of a character that you're interested in, regardless of where.

24:25.139 --> 24:26.921
That may be, yeah.

24:27.341 --> 24:28.783
And would you agree with that?

24:28.843 --> 24:32.688
And I wonder, what is the kind of character that particularly fascinates you?

24:33.569 --> 24:46.384
Well, I guess it's somebody who's kind of rattled and hell-bent and is trying to bear up under the weight of love's demands.

24:47.545 --> 24:49.528
Of what demands?

24:49.548 --> 24:50.490
Of demands.

24:50.510 --> 24:51.611
Of demands, okay.

24:52.873 --> 25:00.466
And you would say that that is, if there is a consistency in the characters that you've written about that, that would probably... I suppose.

25:00.506 --> 25:14.548
I mean, I'm real reluctant to try to wrap my hand around a character and say, this is what it is, any more than I would want anybody to do that to me.

25:14.984 --> 25:22.154
You know, and I mean, I suppose that, I mean, I don't, you know, I don't really try, I myself don't try to figure these things out.

25:22.194 --> 25:23.936
I figure that's the professor's job.

25:24.276 --> 25:24.397
Right.

25:24.597 --> 25:26.259
You know, is to do that kind of work.

25:26.299 --> 25:34.130
I mean, my stuff is just to get it down really honestly and, you know, with as much, you know, goodwill as I can.

25:34.610 --> 25:36.433
And I don't know that.

25:36.473 --> 25:42.321
I mean, you know, there may be things that are consistent running from character to character.

25:42.341 --> 25:44.063
They seem to tend to be

25:44.482 --> 25:47.727
in extreme situations often.

25:48.468 --> 25:54.137
You know, I mean, in this book now, I kept trying to think about what crime was.

25:54.838 --> 25:57.322
You know, that kept coming back into my mind.

25:57.943 --> 25:58.664
In what respect?

25:59.225 --> 26:00.046
Well, just what it is.

26:00.066 --> 26:05.815
Did you come to some kind of an answer?

26:05.930 --> 26:06.551
Not really.

26:06.591 --> 26:07.532
I mean, I'm writing a novel.

26:07.613 --> 26:09.495
I'm not writing a film novel.

26:09.596 --> 26:16.586
I understand, but for yourself, to resolve the problems of your novel, you probably have to resolve the questions for yourself.

26:17.147 --> 26:18.910
Well, it's a different kind of resolution.

26:18.970 --> 26:26.301
I mean, it's kind of like saying, I mean, if you're married or something, it's like trying to ask yourself, what is my marriage?

26:26.281 --> 26:29.388
I don't know if there's any answer to questions like that.

26:29.789 --> 26:45.825
I mean, for an artist, what an artist does is to try to, I think, to try to throw out all of the kind of complexity as artfully and honestly as possible so that we have an experience, an imaginative experience.

26:45.805 --> 26:47.627
you know, the reality of life.

26:48.188 --> 26:57.197
And so that's what I was trying to do in this book rather than to do something like, okay, here's a definition of crime or here's a philosophical exploration of it.

26:57.557 --> 26:59.840
Here's an imaginative experience of it.

26:59.880 --> 27:01.041
That's what I'm doing.

27:01.321 --> 27:05.966
You know, and I attempted to do that, you know, as fully as I was able to do.

27:06.607 --> 27:08.509
You know, that was not my whole idea.

27:08.529 --> 27:11.853
It wasn't like I sat down and say, okay, you know, like I had a topic.

27:11.913 --> 27:12.794
What is crime?

27:13.234 --> 27:15.036
This was just a question that came...

27:15.016 --> 27:22.779
So among the thousands of questions that came through in the writing of the book, this was one of them that showed up often.

27:23.601 --> 27:29.498
But you mentioned, again, to go back to the word you used earlier, tragedy.

27:30.507 --> 27:34.111
conceive of this as a kind of tragedy?

27:34.691 --> 27:41.279
And also, if that is the case, do you expect that there should be some kind of a catharsis here?

27:42.440 --> 27:45.403
Where the exploration is about the nature of crime?

27:46.424 --> 27:49.808
I'm not sure that this particular book I'd call a tragedy.

27:51.049 --> 27:54.453
But is there a form of catharsis in it in any case, would you say?

27:54.473 --> 27:55.554
Well, yeah, I hope so.

27:55.854 --> 28:00.379
I mean, I hope that there's a sense of the circle being fulfilled or

28:00.899 --> 28:11.478
you know, the story being told, you know, I mean, in that sense, I mean, in catharsis in the sense that, you know, possibly so.

28:11.498 --> 28:25.523
I mean, if I define catharsis, you know, it's kind of like the, you know, the shudder at the root of being, you know, in kind of acknowledgement of having experienced the heart of things, it would be nice if that were so.

28:25.503 --> 28:43.495
With this book, in some degree, every good book has either faint or profoundly that shudder of catharsis, of a kind of reception, acknowledgement, experience of the trembling heart of life.

28:43.795 --> 28:48.382
And in that sense, I hope that there is some sort of catharsis at the end of this book.

28:48.482 --> 29:06.929
I mean, whether this can be defined as a tragedy or not, once again, I have no kind of, there's no kind of formulaic or programmatic approach to these books that I figure, okay, tragedy has these elements, and so these elements must be put into the book.

29:06.989 --> 29:09.212
Those are not the kind of concerns I have.

29:09.682 --> 29:16.876
In writing it, I mean, in hindsight, I've written a book in which the two main characters wind up dead at the end.

29:18.439 --> 29:21.224
You know, well, that's going to be either, you know, who knows what that's going to be.

29:21.244 --> 29:22.246
It could be a comedy.

29:22.286 --> 29:23.549
But did you know that?

29:23.729 --> 29:28.077
Did you know that this was the inevitable consequence of what was going on?

29:28.578 --> 29:29.059
No.

29:29.079 --> 29:32.145
I mean, like I tell you, I really don't know what the next sentence is.

29:32.412 --> 29:35.977
But you must have had a sense that they were pointing to this at some point.

29:36.378 --> 29:38.761
I don't really go at it that way.

29:40.303 --> 29:56.226
You know, I mean, to some degree, you know, there are times in a novel when the security in writing comes from having a kind of little kind of area ahead of you where you feel that there's a cleared space.

29:56.864 --> 30:08.047
You know, that you're not just kind of jam up against, you know, the whatever, you know, just the unexpectedness, you know.

30:08.087 --> 30:12.997
I mean, there are times in a novel when you kind of need that.

30:13.038 --> 30:16.645
It can come like toward the end of a chapter when you get a sense of...

30:16.625 --> 30:19.870
of the rhythm and the momentum and what's going to happen.

30:20.391 --> 30:28.305
And it eases the imagination sometimes to have a sense, like, okay, this is going to end.

30:29.787 --> 30:38.802
But for me, there are other times when you can't know that at all, when you're just kind of writing, and you're really kind of trusting

30:39.035 --> 30:47.864
that there's a stronger rhythm, that there's a truer source underneath the rational mind that you're engaged with.

30:48.625 --> 30:52.389
I mean, I've been a professional writer since I was a teenager.

30:53.010 --> 30:53.811
Is that right?

30:54.251 --> 30:56.774
Yeah, I published my first stories when I was a teenager.

30:56.854 --> 30:59.297
I worked on newspapers from my teen years.

30:59.617 --> 31:00.278
Now, where was this?

31:02.480 --> 31:03.001
Where was it?

31:03.041 --> 31:04.022
Yeah, where, basically.

31:04.062 --> 31:04.542
Where were you?

31:04.562 --> 31:06.604
Down in Georgia and in North Carolina.

31:07.545 --> 31:08.046
And...

31:08.988 --> 31:19.405
Could you give me a sense without, you know, giving me your whole CV and the... But you have lived in a lot of different places, apparently, that I, you know... Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:19.425 --> 31:19.806
Uh-huh, yeah.

31:20.347 --> 31:20.607
Uh-huh, yeah.

31:20.627 --> 31:21.769
Uh-huh, yeah.

31:21.789 --> 31:22.110
Uh-huh, yeah.

31:22.230 --> 31:22.490
Uh-huh, yeah.

31:22.510 --> 31:22.831
Uh-huh, yeah.

31:22.851 --> 31:23.172
Uh-huh, yeah.

31:23.192 --> 31:23.512
Uh-huh, yeah.

31:23.572 --> 31:23.973
Uh-huh, yeah.

31:23.993 --> 31:24.995
Uh-huh, yeah.

31:25.015 --> 31:25.275
Uh-huh, yeah.

31:25.295 --> 31:25.556
Uh-huh, yeah.

31:25.576 --> 31:25.836
Uh-huh, yeah.

31:25.856 --> 31:26.137
Uh-huh, yeah.

31:26.157 --> 31:26.417
Uh-huh, yeah.

31:26.437 --> 31:27.579
Uh-huh, yeah.

31:27.599 --> 31:28.300
Uh-huh, yeah.

31:28.320 --> 31:28.581
Uh-huh, yeah.

31:28.601 --> 31:28.861
Uh-huh, yeah.

31:28.881 --> 31:29.142
Uh-huh, yeah.

31:29.162 --> 31:29.422
Uh-huh, yeah.

31:29.442 --> 31:29.702
Uh-huh, yeah.

31:29.722 --> 31:29.983
Uh-huh, yeah.

31:30.003 --> 31:30.283
Uh-huh, yeah.

31:30.303 --> 31:30.564
Uh-huh, yeah.

31:30.584 --> 31:30.904
Uh-huh, yeah.

31:30.924 --> 31:31.185
Uh-huh, yeah.

31:31.626 --> 31:31.886
Uh-huh, yeah.

31:31.906 --> 31:32.167
Uh-huh, yeah.

31:32.187 --> 31:32.447
Uh-huh, yeah.

31:33.338 --> 31:39.784
Been in the South since 1600, been in Georgia since the early 7th, since Georgia began.

31:39.824 --> 31:44.048
And pretty much down in the same place.

31:46.170 --> 31:47.572
You know, I mean, it's an old family.

31:47.972 --> 31:48.453
Still there.

31:48.833 --> 31:49.373
Still there.

31:49.413 --> 31:54.518
Yeah, now they're kind of scattered around Georgia a little bit.

31:55.419 --> 31:58.102
Atlanta and South Georgia, that kind of thing.

31:59.063 --> 32:01.405
But pretty much have always been there.

32:02.735 --> 32:04.680
Farmers, businessmen.

32:06.725 --> 32:10.896
I'm the oldest stepson of Dean Daysmith, if you've heard of Days Inn.

32:12.801 --> 32:15.327
That's my stepmother.

32:15.830 --> 32:18.152
Uh, my father died last year.

32:18.172 --> 32:26.801
He was a, uh, uh, he was a farmer, a businessman, owned a, uh, chemical corporation, uh, for years.

32:26.921 --> 32:30.184
Uh, he was, uh, uh, what was that guy?

32:30.204 --> 32:33.207
Walter Mondale was the marine manager in the South.

32:33.227 --> 32:33.848
Oh, wow.

32:33.868 --> 32:45.499
Uh, you know, various kinds of things like that, uh, horsemen, uh, all this kind of business, uh, you know, kind of like South Georgia guy, went to Harvard, uh,

32:47.808 --> 32:48.610
My father did.

32:48.650 --> 32:51.619
Let's see, what else kind of thing?

32:51.639 --> 32:55.449
I mean, I left town to go off to boarding school when I was 14.

32:56.111 --> 32:56.492
Up here?

32:57.074 --> 32:58.277
Yeah, I went to Exeter.

32:59.962 --> 33:00.122
Oh.

33:00.142 --> 33:00.543
That's fair.

33:01.466 --> 33:02.188
Went to...

33:02.692 --> 33:23.464
Went to Duke, quit there, knocked around, was in the Peace Corps, wandered around Europe, around this country, in and out of trouble, a whole bunch of kinds of jobs, a lot of different kinds of writing jobs, newspaper jobs, PR jobs.

33:23.484 --> 33:25.307
There was always writing, though, I gather.

33:25.540 --> 33:26.001
Pretty much.

33:26.041 --> 33:27.685
I mean, I really, well, I say jobs.

33:27.745 --> 33:32.535
I really haven't really had much of, I don't really have much of a work history, if you want to know the truth.

33:33.518 --> 33:40.553
I mean, I'll be 50 next year, and I suppose all together in my life I've put in, say, less than four years working on a job.

33:41.515 --> 33:43.059
But I've had a lot of jobs.

33:43.179 --> 33:43.279
Yeah.

33:44.575 --> 33:50.161
That's a great quote.

33:50.181 --> 33:50.662
I like that.

33:50.682 --> 33:55.106
I had some real brief jobs, you know, and some of them have been writing jobs.

33:55.187 --> 34:04.817
I mean, I've worked as a reporter on a newspaper job that lasted like 10 days, you know, various other jobs, a lot of freelance kind of work.

34:04.857 --> 34:11.224
I've done a lot of physical labor kind of jobs, apple picking, you know,

34:11.778 --> 34:15.864
Well, it all goes into the building of character, doesn't it, huh?

34:15.884 --> 34:16.364
I suppose.

34:16.485 --> 34:20.971
Well, you know, I've always just kind of, you know, I was always interested in being a writer.

34:21.492 --> 34:25.437
And I think the only reason I've had jobs is because I had to make a living.

34:25.457 --> 34:36.553
I mean, to a certain extent, I mean, I'm old enough to have come up in, you know, I came up in the 60s and kind of in those knockabout years that people had in the 60s.

34:37.124 --> 34:56.432
You know, when young people kind of went out on the road, wandering around and doing stuff at a pretty early age, I think, I don't know what it's like now, but, you know, I mean, in my generation, people were, you know, I mean, you could go out wandering, you know, I mean, take off.

34:56.767 --> 35:08.159
and do stuff, and you had this kind of hand-to-mouth way of trying to make a living doing one thing or another, wind up in a town, get a little job, hang out for a while, move on, this kind of thing.

35:08.179 --> 35:09.720
And there was a lot of that going on.

35:11.582 --> 35:22.473
I didn't have so much of a sense of trying to collect information or build up a repertoire of characters and things like that.

35:22.493 --> 35:24.495
I'm immensely grateful for it now.

35:25.184 --> 35:44.551
You know, to have spent time hanging around shrimpers, you know, in Apalachicola or, you know, whatever, or, you know, Hispanics in Spanish Harlem in New York City or, you know, people in Venice, you know, guys in the docks in Venezuela or something like that.

35:44.571 --> 35:48.897
I mean, to have had these experiences are now extremely valuable to me because I can draw on them.

35:48.877 --> 35:53.723
But it sounds like you were an early reader, a very appreciative reader.

35:54.644 --> 35:57.928
Books, I would assume, are very important.

35:57.948 --> 36:07.740
I mean, to me, I think this is the only, you know, I mean, people, you know, you hear people talk about, you know, like, you know, like, you know, I've done so much stuff, I ought to write a book, you know.

36:08.280 --> 36:09.522
Oh, I love that line.

36:09.622 --> 36:10.883
I say do it.

36:11.384 --> 36:16.009
Well, you know, the problem with that is that books are not made of experiences, they're made of words.

36:17.031 --> 36:18.192
And that's a different matter.

36:18.897 --> 36:22.844
And, you know, if they were made of experiences, we'd all be novels.

36:22.864 --> 36:24.047
You know, we'd all be writers.

36:24.347 --> 36:24.888
But they're not.

36:24.928 --> 36:26.952
They're made of words, and that's a different thing.

36:27.433 --> 36:37.692
And what made me, you know, the way I wanted to become a writer was not because I had interesting experience, but because I was excited by what other writers were doing on the page.

36:38.814 --> 36:40.838
That was what attracted me to being a writer.

36:41.459 --> 36:49.147
was that I read, I was exposed to writing early, and what clicked in me was that I wanted to do what these guys were doing.

36:49.167 --> 36:59.558
I didn't want to, you know, I mean, to some degree, I mean, you read certain kind of novels or something, and you may say, like, you know, like, whatever, you want to, you know, have experiences like Hemingway or something like that.

36:59.919 --> 37:06.786
But I was much less interested in that than I was interested in this whole thing of having something come alive on a piece of paper.

37:07.067 --> 37:08.428
Now, that was interesting.

37:09.083 --> 37:10.025
That's a great quote.

37:10.686 --> 37:16.637
And when you read other, do you read your contemporaries or do you read, who do you read for pleasure or do you read for pleasure?

37:16.697 --> 37:24.992
And when you read, do you read more or less as a carpenter, you know, examining how the other guy builds the cabinet or something like that, you know?

37:25.012 --> 37:28.138
Well, I don't think I can help but read like that, you know, I don't.

37:28.118 --> 37:30.721
I don't read a whole lot of contemporary fiction.

37:31.022 --> 37:32.724
I'm not really up on that very well.

37:33.004 --> 37:38.191
I mean, once in a while something will catch my eye and I'll take a look at it to see what's going on.

37:38.211 --> 37:47.724
I mean, there's certain contemporaries that I admire, you know, but poems I read constantly, all day, every day.

37:48.304 --> 37:48.585
Really?

37:48.865 --> 37:49.125
Yeah.

37:49.266 --> 37:53.451
I mean, you know, I can give you a list of the people I'm reading now.

37:54.038 --> 37:57.461
But it's always changing.

37:57.481 --> 37:58.702
It's not necessary.

37:59.903 --> 38:04.047
Charlie, I think we've done this for about 45 minutes, and I've got lots of stuff here.

38:04.407 --> 38:04.788
Oh, good.

38:04.808 --> 38:07.270
And I'll be writing this to go out next week.

38:07.971 --> 38:08.071
Okay.

38:08.091 --> 38:10.573
If I have any questions, I know you right now.

38:11.093 --> 38:12.975
Don't bother you before 11 a.m., right?

38:13.516 --> 38:14.817
Yeah.

38:14.837 --> 38:16.839
If you've got any more questions, call me back.

38:16.999 --> 38:17.239
Okay.

38:17.259 --> 38:24.045
Well, what I'm going to do is transcribe this tape and go to work on this story, and I'll be moving it along next week.

38:24.565 --> 38:27.337
And if I do have any specific questions, I will give you a call.

38:27.357 --> 38:30.590
I shouldn't have any, but if I do, I'll give you a ring.

38:30.610 --> 38:32.719
I can get a copy of what you do.

38:33.020 --> 38:33.440
Sure.

38:34.321 --> 38:37.864
Just give me an address, and I'll send it to you directly if you want, or a fax, or whatever.

38:38.085 --> 38:38.645
Yeah, sure.

38:38.665 --> 38:44.630
I mean, you know, whatever, because I don't get any of those, I don't take any of those newspapers, and so I hate for it to go by and not see it.

38:44.650 --> 38:46.552
No, and I don't get all those newspapers either.

38:46.592 --> 38:56.901
I send it out, but I will have a couple of copies, and I always send stuff to Ruth Wiener, but I'd be more than happy to, that'll be weeks before you get it, so why don't you just give me an address, and I'd be happy to send you a copy.

38:56.921 --> 38:57.021
Okay.

38:57.362 --> 38:59.544
My address is 23 Waverly Place.

39:00.104 --> 39:00.985
It was just down there, like,

39:04.745 --> 39:06.875
I'm in Worcester, actually.

39:06.975 --> 39:10.733
I'm in Grafton, which is a... I gave a reading in Worcester last spring.

39:10.753 --> 39:11.014
You did?

39:11.356 --> 39:11.818
Where?

39:12.355 --> 39:16.242
At the library, there's a poetry reading series at the library.

39:16.362 --> 39:20.750
Oh, you know, they, okay, good, that's cool, yeah.

39:21.011 --> 39:24.036
They have a great poetry association up here, you know.

39:24.277 --> 39:25.339
Yeah, it was fun.

39:25.359 --> 39:26.641
It was a very good experience.

39:26.761 --> 39:28.344
Yeah, I mean, very, very supportive.

39:28.364 --> 39:35.818
I mean, this is the, Stanley Kunitz is from Worcester, Elizabeth Bishop, Charles Olson, that's not bad.

39:36.339 --> 39:36.439
Yeah.

39:36.419 --> 39:38.903
A bad group of people coming from one city.

39:39.504 --> 39:41.747
23 Waverly Place, NYC.

39:42.749 --> 39:43.510
Say again.

39:43.530 --> 39:46.114
6Z, the apartment number.

39:46.394 --> 39:49.018
C as in Charlie or Z as in Zebra.

39:49.719 --> 39:51.402
And the zip is 100... 10003.

39:51.783 --> 39:54.647
Okay, good.

39:54.627 --> 39:55.389
Okay.

39:56.030 --> 39:56.391
All right.

39:56.431 --> 39:58.616
And if I have any questions, I'll give you a call.

39:59.117 --> 39:59.417
All right.

39:59.438 --> 40:00.540
Yeah, well, thanks for doing that.

40:00.620 --> 40:01.462
Well, I appreciate it.

40:01.883 --> 40:05.250
You're taking the time to talk to me, and we'll talk again, I hope.

40:05.451 --> 40:05.831
Okay.

40:05.972 --> 40:06.333
Take care.

40:06.874 --> 40:07.455
Bye-bye.
