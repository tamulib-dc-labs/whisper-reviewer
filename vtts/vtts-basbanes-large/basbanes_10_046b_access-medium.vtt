WEBVTT

00:02.242 --> 00:05.725
I don't have to take up too much of your time.

00:05.805 --> 00:06.967
No, no, that's all right.

00:06.987 --> 00:08.308
I'm not doing anything.

00:08.328 --> 00:10.030
Do you think we've covered the high points?

00:11.291 --> 00:22.241
Is there anything that I should know about your husband that you think that we haven't covered as a bookseller?

00:22.261 --> 00:27.326
No, I mean, there's... You've given me a lot of names of people I can call, too.

00:27.526 --> 00:27.767
Yeah.

00:27.787 --> 00:30.429
He'll say things about him, which is nice.

00:30.830 --> 00:31.270
Nice things about him.

00:33.055 --> 00:36.339
Well, it also depends how much you want to write about it.

00:36.359 --> 00:39.262
You said only, didn't you say only a chapter or something?

00:39.282 --> 00:41.624
Oh, it's a chapter, yeah, but I'm looking for good little stories.

00:41.644 --> 00:42.685
Oh, I see, yeah.

00:43.526 --> 00:45.148
And how influential they were.

00:45.889 --> 00:50.614
How, according to Roger Stoddard, we have things here that you don't have in Europe.

00:51.515 --> 00:56.380
We have things here that are better than what you find in Europe because of these booksellers.

00:57.710 --> 01:00.132
It's quite a comment to make, isn't it?

01:00.152 --> 01:00.773
Yeah.

01:00.793 --> 01:06.258
Lucien was very friendly with Donald Wing from Yves.

01:06.278 --> 01:10.341
You know, unfortunately he had this cancer in the throat and he couldn't talk.

01:10.822 --> 01:19.850
But he and Lucien got on so well, and Donald Wing was interested in more romantic French literature.

01:19.870 --> 01:27.497
But I must say there's one thing, that the booksellers are not of the same cup of tea

01:27.730 --> 01:30.272
as when we came here at the beginning.

01:30.733 --> 01:37.319
The knowledge of Jackson and other of these people, now you don't get this.

01:37.339 --> 01:38.180
You need the librarians.

01:38.200 --> 01:40.101
Yeah, you don't get this anymore.

01:40.702 --> 01:42.584
See, that also has changed.

01:42.604 --> 01:45.006
That has changed, yeah.

01:45.146 --> 01:52.052
I find it's too bad that this, with all this internet, the people are not going to use this anymore, you know?

01:52.533 --> 01:55.155
It's all pressing on a button and you get knowledge.

01:55.372 --> 01:57.994
But what kind of knowledge do you get?

02:00.616 --> 02:02.818
Well, they get information, which is not knowledge.

02:03.299 --> 02:04.800
Information is just data.

02:04.980 --> 02:06.802
I know, but it's so terrible.

02:06.862 --> 02:09.304
It doesn't, I mean, it doesn't excite you.

02:09.364 --> 02:09.584
No, no.

02:10.185 --> 02:12.547
It's also discovering things by yourself.

02:14.168 --> 02:18.071
So he used to go to the Grosje Club library, to the... Oh, yes.

02:18.131 --> 02:20.914
He was very friendly with Nykirk.

02:20.934 --> 02:24.957
You know, the one that died before, died about six,

02:25.291 --> 02:27.093
Years ago, before Martin.

02:27.153 --> 02:28.194
I quote him, yeah, that's right.

02:28.214 --> 02:31.316
And actually, Kimball followed him, I think.

02:31.336 --> 02:32.557
Yeah, Kimball, yeah.

02:32.597 --> 02:33.098
Kimball came in.

02:33.118 --> 02:33.878
Yeah, Kimball came in.

02:34.359 --> 02:36.721
And then he went over to Sotheby.

02:36.741 --> 02:37.822
Sotheby's.

02:37.842 --> 02:37.962
Right.

02:37.982 --> 02:40.204
That's where he is.

02:40.224 --> 02:42.286
But Martin was very, very good.

02:42.626 --> 02:47.650
Yeah, Martin wrote a memorial statement for your hand.

02:47.670 --> 02:52.234
Yeah, but I asked him, because, you see, it had to be done so quickly.

02:52.695 --> 02:53.696
So I had all this.

02:53.796 --> 02:55.197
My son helped me a little bit.

02:55.345 --> 03:06.362
But I was really, not interviewing, but I arranged it straight away to do all this, because this I found I had to do.

03:07.063 --> 03:08.465
That was a sort of farewell.

03:08.866 --> 03:12.712
Though I haven't always been treated like I should, but there we are.

03:12.872 --> 03:15.836
We never had a word between us, because I played second fiddle.

03:16.557 --> 03:19.622
And that's probably why it worked.

03:19.642 --> 03:21.505
Now, what you did is you...

03:22.092 --> 03:24.455
largely wrote these descriptions for the books?

03:24.575 --> 03:27.579
Well, I did most of the, lots of the description.

03:27.679 --> 03:31.043
I mean, actually, Lucien had more knowledge than I had.

03:31.163 --> 03:33.566
I didn't have any Greek, I only had nothing at school.

03:34.087 --> 03:40.595
But still, I had more professional, it was funny, because he never went to library school.

03:41.115 --> 03:44.600
So he learned this, shall we say, by himself.

03:45.241 --> 03:49.686
And I had my formative kind of background,

03:49.987 --> 03:54.131
And sometimes I said, but one doesn't write this way, it should be done this way.

03:54.692 --> 03:59.617
So he caught on, and we didn't argue.

03:59.637 --> 04:02.960
Well, I mean, look, why should I?

04:02.980 --> 04:05.022
Well, you say I can take these?

04:05.042 --> 04:06.083
Yes, you can take these.

04:06.103 --> 04:11.789
Could you say also that you could copy the Le Monde article for me, from the Beres interview?

04:11.909 --> 04:12.730
Yes, Le Monde.

04:12.910 --> 04:13.991
I will have it zero.

04:14.231 --> 04:15.412
Oh, that would be great.

04:15.453 --> 04:16.353
I don't have it zero.

04:17.014 --> 04:17.935
In the family.

04:18.370 --> 04:21.153
You should tell me just a little bit about Lucien's background.

04:22.095 --> 04:39.055
Well, his father was a doctor in law, and he had, well, he worked in Germany as a lawyer for, until really the Nazi came along.

04:39.455 --> 04:41.618
And he, they had three children.

04:42.439 --> 04:46.504
Lucien was the youngest, then the eldest was Raymond Goldsmith,

04:47.041 --> 04:52.667
who was in the State Department, one of the top economists, and he went over to Europe.

04:53.368 --> 04:56.612
He was nominated Brigadier General.

04:57.613 --> 05:00.296
He never did any military in his life.

05:00.917 --> 05:07.344
But he was in connection with the mark when it was changed, you see.

05:07.364 --> 05:13.551
And he wrote something like 32 books on economics.

05:13.571 --> 05:16.474
He was afterwards professor at Yale.

05:17.180 --> 05:19.522
until a few years ago.

05:19.863 --> 05:21.184
So they came to America, too?

05:21.204 --> 05:23.667
Oh, he came before Lucien.

05:23.687 --> 05:28.092
And he studied, I think, in London before he came.

05:28.472 --> 05:31.936
And thanks to him, Lucien was able to come over.

05:32.016 --> 05:37.261
And the second one actually went to Israel.

05:37.321 --> 05:42.587
He's the one that founded the kibbutz Engev with Kolek.

05:42.607 --> 05:45.330
You know, Kolek of the...

05:45.766 --> 05:46.667
That's right.

05:46.687 --> 05:49.311
Ex-mayor, a wonderful fellow.

05:49.792 --> 05:51.294
Oh, he was marvelous.

05:51.454 --> 05:56.281
I just loved the way he talked, and no fuss, you know, it was terrific.

05:56.942 --> 06:05.714
And then Lucien came five or six years later, and these two brothers were so, I would say, really nasty to him.

06:06.155 --> 06:11.082
So Lucien developed a kind of, as a revenge,

06:11.348 --> 06:14.091
to try and learn everything by heart.

06:14.191 --> 06:22.781
He could tell you inside out the names of the different Secretary of State of different countries.

06:23.161 --> 06:28.507
So you see how all this has been developed early in life.

06:29.949 --> 06:31.030
He liked to memorize things.

06:31.251 --> 06:32.272
Yes, memorize.

06:32.432 --> 06:40.461
He had to do that because then he had the revenge on his brothers, who really said, oh, you're a little boy, you don't know anything.

06:40.762 --> 06:46.728
So he used to come out because he used to read, and he was always a great reader of the newspaper.

06:48.770 --> 06:50.151
That he's done all his life.

06:50.992 --> 06:51.753
It meant a lot.

06:51.773 --> 06:53.154
He had to be informed.

06:54.456 --> 06:58.099
So his mother never went to school.

06:58.300 --> 07:00.141
She played the piano beautifully.

07:00.942 --> 07:06.668
Her mother could have been a concert pianist, but she wasn't allowed.

07:07.036 --> 07:14.602
His grandfather retired at the age of 39, and when he married, he told his wife, where do you want to live?

07:15.323 --> 07:15.823
Paris?

07:17.305 --> 07:18.045
Berlin?

07:19.306 --> 07:20.007
Vienna?

07:20.047 --> 07:22.849
And they could choose in those days.

07:22.929 --> 07:27.413
There was no passport.

07:27.433 --> 07:28.794
So you could live anywhere.

07:31.016 --> 07:31.577
That's great.

07:31.597 --> 07:33.218
That's great.

07:33.238 --> 07:34.539
Listen, I have to go downtown.

07:34.599 --> 07:36.241
I have a meeting coming up.

07:36.261 --> 07:36.621
Okay, fine.
