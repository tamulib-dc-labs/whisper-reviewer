WEBVTT

00:02.005 --> 00:08.953
We met once before, well actually several times before, but we did a formal interview I think in Boston.

00:09.915 --> 00:12.057
I don't remember how many years or so it was.

00:13.138 --> 00:14.260
Longer than you try to think.

00:14.280 --> 00:15.802
Time passes.

00:16.523 --> 00:22.169
And I think we sat at the same table at lunch at the ABA this year.

00:22.209 --> 00:23.571
Oh really?

00:24.192 --> 00:30.139
In any case, I'm pleased to have a... The ABA, the last ABA, not the one you just had.

00:30.608 --> 00:32.250
Was it Miami, perhaps?

00:32.310 --> 00:34.073
Yeah, Miami Beach, I was there.

00:34.273 --> 00:38.719
Okay, yeah, that's where these things do become a blur after a while.

00:40.100 --> 00:48.311
An interesting book that you have here, and I wonder if you could tell me how you see this fitting into the corpus, so to speak.

00:49.312 --> 01:00.447
Well, the history behind this book goes back to the fact that in Canada I've been involved in small publishing, small literary publishing through the years.

01:01.625 --> 01:12.647
And if you look on where it says Acknowledgements, you'll probably see that these appeared in two books from Coates has Pratt originally.

01:13.829 --> 01:19.380
And then they got published in England, and they got...

01:19.597 --> 01:24.322
translated into such languages as German and Swedish and French.

01:25.603 --> 01:35.634
And they were not, because they're not classifiable, you know, you can't say it's a novel, it's a short story, or it's poetry.

01:36.595 --> 01:38.717
American publishers just didn't know what to do.

01:40.298 --> 01:48.507
So finally, Nan Tlaive decided, why don't we take some from each and put them all together

01:49.212 --> 02:17.008
in one book so that is what they did but they are pieces that I write from time to time and they usually appear first in magazines and I read them at readings they're perfect for reading because they're very self-contained and they've been very popular with creative writing teachers who take them into the classrooms

02:18.102 --> 02:26.015
as an example to the students of something they can do that's short enough for them to manage when they're just beginning.

02:26.355 --> 02:31.964
Do you see each one as complete pieces, despite the... Yes, they're complete pieces.

02:31.984 --> 02:40.198
I know it's interesting, you should say, that I've done these little reviews for the New York Times over the years, and they tell you 200 words.

02:40.398 --> 02:43.603
You know, if you do 210, we've got to cut 10 words out of the thing.

02:44.244 --> 02:45.426
And it's amazing...

02:45.963 --> 02:51.969
You know, how you really try and be fair and just to a book in 200 words, how hard that is.

02:52.009 --> 02:54.632
It's harder than that in a longer form.

02:55.894 --> 02:58.677
And your answer anticipated another question.

02:58.777 --> 03:05.864
I felt that these were almost pieces that Margaret Atwood would write if she were like Ellen Goodman, you know, writing a column for her.

03:05.884 --> 03:06.245
Oh, no.

03:06.645 --> 03:07.546
No, I don't think so.

03:07.566 --> 03:11.110
They're far too condensed linguistically for that.

03:11.545 --> 03:20.860
But in terms of they are brief and concise, and they could almost be published in a newspaper, so to speak.

03:20.880 --> 03:21.781
I don't think so.

03:21.941 --> 03:28.031
I don't think newspaper readers would know what to make of them a lot of the time.

03:28.892 --> 03:32.017
I think they're a bit too literary for that, apparently, is such a word.

03:32.698 --> 03:37.446
Do you feel that the reader of these pieces has to be familiar with Margaret Atwood?

03:37.646 --> 03:38.127
No.

03:38.950 --> 03:46.906
I think the reader of the pieces, however, has to be familiar with, for instance, Gertrude talks back.

03:47.587 --> 03:49.010
You'd have to be familiar with Hamlet.

03:49.211 --> 03:52.858
Well, you know, I have that here in my notes, and I thought...

03:53.716 --> 03:59.125
In its own way, it does give a very accurate summary of the play.

03:59.806 --> 04:02.269
Well, there's quite a few things thrown in.

04:03.351 --> 04:07.778
Yeah, but I mean in terms of the factual nature of the play is correct.

04:07.798 --> 04:08.539
Yeah.

04:09.321 --> 04:11.023
The references are correct.

04:12.446 --> 04:19.296
Anyway, you never know because the little red hen, you would think everybody knows that.

04:19.657 --> 04:19.757
Yeah.

04:19.973 --> 04:25.601
But in fact, it was translated into German, and I read it out of an assemblage of German academics.

04:25.621 --> 04:27.144
In German or in English?

04:27.164 --> 04:27.925
In German.

04:27.945 --> 04:28.465
Oh, really?

04:30.208 --> 04:30.408
Yes.

04:31.109 --> 04:32.151
How did it translate?

04:32.351 --> 04:35.376
Well, it translated very well, and it was very funny.

04:36.297 --> 04:38.721
But they had never heard of The Little Red Hemp.

04:39.922 --> 04:42.306
It's not a known German story.

04:42.706 --> 04:47.854
So in fact, I found myself having to explain what that story was in the originals.

04:48.357 --> 04:52.962
And now there's all these German academics analyzing the little red hand.

04:52.982 --> 04:56.626
Now, you don't consider this serious work, do you?

04:57.407 --> 04:58.949
Well, some of it is serious.

04:58.969 --> 05:00.471
Well, of course it's serious work.

05:01.372 --> 05:02.293
What do you mean by now?

05:02.313 --> 05:09.641
Well, I guess I meant by asking the question to get a response.

05:11.703 --> 05:17.210
Well, some of them are funny, but if you turn towards the back, you will find pieces like death scenes.

05:17.330 --> 05:17.470
Mm-hmm.

05:17.686 --> 05:20.590
or good bones of self or third-handed.

05:22.593 --> 05:23.515
Now, do you write these?

05:23.715 --> 05:27.020
That's why I would say these are not newspaper pieces.

05:28.442 --> 05:33.250
Do you write these more or less as a diversion from the larger work?

05:33.430 --> 05:35.653
No, I write them the same way I write poems.

05:37.175 --> 05:40.200
They're a recognized European form.

05:41.243 --> 05:43.987
What is the descriptive term then?

05:44.248 --> 05:47.152
Well, the French would probably call them prose poems.

05:47.412 --> 05:49.556
Kafka might call some of them parables.

05:50.137 --> 05:50.297
Huh.

05:51.418 --> 05:54.844
And is that how they're... Kafka wrote in short forms a lot, as you know.

05:54.884 --> 06:00.993
And the Surrealists were quite keen on short prose forms.

06:01.013 --> 06:04.358
And is this how they are described in Europe?

06:05.219 --> 06:08.064
Well, the Europeans don't seem to have a trouble with the concepts.

06:08.825 --> 06:08.905
Huh.

06:09.712 --> 06:19.961
I realize it's a little early, but how have your American and Canadian readers been responding to this?

06:20.162 --> 06:24.666
Well, the Canadian readers had first crack at it, and they responded in large numbers.

06:25.186 --> 06:25.506
Really?

06:26.507 --> 06:29.770
And the American readers, of course, have just come out here.

06:31.132 --> 06:37.137
So it's a little bit early to tell, but you see, you don't write these things...

06:38.618 --> 06:45.524
in order to have, uh, Bridges of Madison County bestsellers.

06:45.544 --> 06:45.825
No?

06:46.385 --> 06:50.709
No.

06:50.749 --> 07:01.138
When I put them into books originally, it was part of the small publishing tie-in, uh, because I knew it would make enough money for the small publisher to keep them going for another year.

07:01.539 --> 07:01.939
Uh-huh.

07:01.959 --> 07:02.399
Which it did.

07:03.320 --> 07:05.682
Uh, I, I think the illustrations are quite nice, too.

07:05.702 --> 07:07.444
They, uh, um,

07:07.880 --> 07:08.561
These are yours?

07:09.202 --> 07:09.522
Yes.

07:12.106 --> 07:16.251
Were these done well after the pieces were written?

07:16.331 --> 07:17.833
Oh, I draw a lot.

07:19.055 --> 07:27.626
And I have done another... I've done a couple of other books, actually, with pictures, and one of them dates back as far as 1970.

07:27.806 --> 07:34.215
It's a poetry book called The Journals of Susanna Moody.

07:34.655 --> 07:35.997
So, again, it's not...

07:36.415 --> 07:38.859
completely out of the blue sort of thing for me to do.

07:39.761 --> 07:48.437
You have demonstrated in the body of your work an interest, a curiosity, a fascination, even in classical and popular mythologies.

07:49.438 --> 07:54.868
And I wonder if this more or less follows along with that interest of yours.

07:56.191 --> 07:56.611
Absolutely.

07:56.631 --> 07:56.972
Absolutely.

07:57.543 --> 08:02.410
You mean by classical and popular, you mean Greek, biblical and... All of the above.

08:02.811 --> 08:03.812
Yeah, absolutely.

08:03.832 --> 08:05.915
Even folk tales, even, and fairy tales.

08:06.476 --> 08:08.419
Building blocks of story, as it were.

08:11.303 --> 08:19.114
I guess we spoke earlier, we mentioned earlier, about how this fits into the body of your work.

08:20.316 --> 08:21.998
I think we touched on that briefly.

08:22.535 --> 08:25.139
How do you see it, actually, in a larger sense?

08:25.379 --> 08:28.965
Well, you see, I'm not an academic doing a thesis on myself.

08:29.766 --> 08:31.589
Thank heavens.

08:31.609 --> 08:35.555
But for future academics who undoubtedly will be doing it.

08:35.575 --> 08:36.877
I'm not going to help them out.

08:36.897 --> 08:37.578
You are or you are not.

08:37.638 --> 08:40.482
I'm not going to tell them.

08:40.502 --> 08:41.083
I'm going to have to do that.

08:41.103 --> 08:44.188
Actually, you know, somebody's already working on this very question.

08:45.097 --> 08:46.158
Really.

08:46.639 --> 08:58.934
I did an interview with Doris Lessing a few weeks ago when she was in New York, and one of the reasons she wrote this memoir, she said, is because she learned that there were five biographers in the works.

08:59.214 --> 09:01.257
So she said, well, let's try and get it right in any case.

09:02.118 --> 09:08.105
Well, I've already had a couple of things come out that are quite wrong, but... What usually do they get wrong?

09:08.205 --> 09:09.146
I'm talking about the work.

09:09.226 --> 09:09.787
They get the facts wrong.

09:10.087 --> 09:11.349
I don't care about opinions.

09:12.430 --> 09:14.833
Everybody's entitled to their own, but when they have you...

09:15.269 --> 09:19.617
Born in a different year than the year you were born in, you know something is wrong.

09:21.000 --> 09:27.292
Yeah, but you mean the opinions of the work, they matter to you certainly.

09:27.413 --> 09:30.058
But it's not something you go around correcting.

09:30.078 --> 09:32.282
You can't correct somebody else's opinion.

09:33.022 --> 09:34.324
But they do get the facts wrong.

09:34.544 --> 09:38.651
Well, are the facts in The Feminist Companion to Literature in English correct?

09:38.671 --> 09:40.093
Because that's my reference.

09:40.133 --> 09:43.819
That's the Yale book, which I have over here.

09:43.939 --> 09:44.080
Uh-oh.

09:44.140 --> 09:46.784
Well, I guess I've got to pick it up.

09:46.804 --> 09:47.866
It's pretty good, actually.

09:47.886 --> 09:48.967
It's a terrific book.

09:48.987 --> 09:50.069
Let's see who did that one.

09:50.129 --> 09:52.373
Virginia Blaine, Isabella Quindy.

09:52.393 --> 09:53.955
But it's an excellent book.

09:55.077 --> 10:00.025
I think the trouble is that once something gets written down, everybody thinks it's true, and then they draw on it.

10:00.292 --> 10:01.834
What's the famous quote?

10:01.974 --> 10:04.897
History repeats itself, but historians repeat one another.

10:05.417 --> 10:06.919
Yeah, something like that.

10:06.939 --> 10:07.780
Something like that.

10:07.800 --> 10:10.122
I think it's a Shaw quote.

10:10.142 --> 10:12.084
Are you working on a novel now?

10:12.925 --> 10:16.329
I am wrestling with a novel.

10:16.349 --> 10:16.769
Wrestling.

10:17.210 --> 10:19.632
Wrestling with a novel.

10:19.933 --> 10:21.334
What does wrestling mean?

10:22.175 --> 10:24.197
Waking up at four in the morning and thinking.

10:25.258 --> 10:28.121
So have you started, do you throw material away at all?

10:28.141 --> 10:29.623
Oh, do I throw, yes.

10:30.312 --> 10:33.556
You don't think in terms of those future scholars who might love to see?

10:33.596 --> 10:34.678
Do I put it in a drawer?

10:35.018 --> 10:35.299
Yeah.

10:35.459 --> 10:36.440
Sometimes I throw it out.

10:36.540 --> 10:39.704
Sometimes I put it in a drawer.

10:40.345 --> 10:48.216
I had an academic, speaking of academics, say to me, are you using a computer now?

10:48.276 --> 10:49.477
And I said, yes.

10:49.578 --> 10:49.958
He said, yes.

10:50.242 --> 10:53.987
I suppose that makes it easier for you to hide things.

10:55.469 --> 10:56.931
And I said, what do you mean hide things?

10:56.951 --> 11:00.856
He said, well, when you change something, there's no record of it.

11:00.876 --> 11:01.517
That's right.

11:02.338 --> 11:03.720
It's not hiding things.

11:04.962 --> 11:05.442
It's writing.

11:05.483 --> 11:15.836
Well, you know, you get out of the University of Texas and you see all these variant drafts after variant drafts, and I suppose they do have their place.

11:16.277 --> 11:18.460
But there are writers who would just as soon...

11:19.030 --> 11:22.995
see the finished work go out there and have that speak.

11:23.015 --> 11:24.476
Well, that's what should be speaking.

11:25.578 --> 11:27.240
You agree with that?

11:28.661 --> 11:29.883
That's what should be speaking.

11:30.023 --> 11:35.289
On the other hand, that doesn't mean that I don't give my manuscripts to the University of Toronto, because I do.

11:36.190 --> 11:40.395
I consider it a job creation program.

11:40.415 --> 11:41.016
For scholars?

11:41.056 --> 11:42.878
Yes, absolutely.

11:42.898 --> 11:45.521
So I would imagine there is an Atwood industry.

11:46.422 --> 11:48.244
Well, there's an Atwood newsletter.

11:49.675 --> 11:55.081
There's an Atwood Association, and it has a newsletter.

11:55.361 --> 11:55.521
Uh-huh.

11:55.541 --> 11:57.203
Are these for fans, or are these for scholars?

11:57.223 --> 12:01.267
No, these are for scholars, and it's an American one.

12:01.287 --> 12:03.629
It must be... You can write it right away and join it, if you wish.

12:04.630 --> 12:05.431
Um, why not?

12:07.253 --> 12:08.454
Where is it headquarters?

12:10.216 --> 12:11.718
I'll follow up on that.

12:11.818 --> 12:14.240
Well, I guess you would find it through the MLA.

12:14.741 --> 12:14.961
Sure.

12:15.141 --> 12:16.763
Well, really, that is...

12:17.317 --> 12:18.418
How do you respond to this?

12:18.498 --> 12:20.601
With wry amusement?

12:21.342 --> 12:23.284
Do you know Max Beerbohm at all?

12:23.805 --> 12:25.987
I know his work, of course, yeah.

12:26.007 --> 12:36.179
He has a cartoon called The Browning Society, which shows these rather dejected-looking people sitting around the discussing Robert Browning and looking terribly earnest.

12:37.801 --> 12:46.952
So I always think of... You can't get too... Usually these things happen to people who are dead.

12:49.109 --> 12:51.953
Generally speaking, of course.

12:51.973 --> 12:58.603
There's a delightful essay that Robert Benchley wrote back in the 30s, which he called, Why Does Nobody Collect Me?

12:59.103 --> 13:00.405
Yes, well, they do now.

13:00.686 --> 13:02.809
They do now.

13:02.829 --> 13:03.670
He was so upset.

13:03.730 --> 13:07.055
I mean, he saw a Hemingway book commanding such and such a price.

13:07.075 --> 13:13.625
He said, nobody's interested in my spare copy of such and such a book, even the one that's a cute story.

13:15.067 --> 13:16.028
Uh...

13:16.008 --> 13:30.551
I guess, where you mentioned that there is this repository in Toronto for your work, and of course there's a newsletter, do you feel... None of this really has anything to do with me, does it?

13:30.571 --> 13:31.773
It doesn't, does it?

13:31.793 --> 13:34.337
I guess that's anticipating a question, isn't it?

13:34.638 --> 13:37.724
The question being, does any of this have anything to do with you?

13:37.764 --> 13:39.066
That would have been the question.

13:40.409 --> 13:45.678
Could you answer it with more than a mono, with a single question?

13:45.698 --> 13:51.609
No, you can't get too hooked on your own, quote, career image.

13:52.751 --> 13:58.722
But you kind of have a, I won't use the word unique, but certainly being...

13:59.326 --> 14:06.896
I think everyone would agree, most knowledgeable readers would agree that you are your country's most prominent writer.

14:07.517 --> 14:11.602
And you do speak for Canadian literature, I guess.

14:11.903 --> 14:16.489
So you do, I guess that does come with some responsibilities, doesn't it?

14:16.509 --> 14:17.230
Or does it not?

14:17.330 --> 14:19.012
Even that's questionable.

14:19.192 --> 14:26.582
I don't like to be, I mean, I am not a government employee.

14:28.402 --> 14:37.934
But it could be suggested that you're certainly a national, I don't want to embarrass you now, but a national treasurer, as the Japanese might say.

14:37.974 --> 14:39.256
There are others.

14:39.276 --> 14:39.957
There are others.

14:40.077 --> 14:46.205
Robertson Davies, of course, is a major, major writer from, as opposed to a major writer.

14:48.608 --> 14:53.474
So you wouldn't feel any special comment on that at all?

14:53.494 --> 14:56.598
Well, you know, I talk about Canadian literature from time to time.

14:56.638 --> 14:58.240
In fact, I have a book of,

14:58.844 --> 15:26.050
a book coming out, which was four lectures that I did at Oxford University Press, at Oxford University, and it will be coming out with Oxford University Press, and it's about Canadian literature, in fact, the literature of the North, and it's called Strange Things, a quote from the Robert Service poem, Strange things are done in the midnight sun, etc.

15:27.076 --> 15:31.802
So I do that from time to time, but it's partly a matter of practicality.

15:31.822 --> 15:35.426
What do I have to tell English people about English literature?

15:36.627 --> 15:37.028
Nothing.

15:38.069 --> 15:44.837
So if I'm going to talk to them at all about anything, it has to be about Canadian literature, which they are guaranteed not to know very much about.

15:46.138 --> 15:50.243
Although Oxford did put out a nice companion to Canadian literature a couple of years ago.

15:50.263 --> 15:52.666
That was put out in Canada, wasn't it?

15:52.686 --> 15:54.568
Yeah, but it was distributed here.

15:54.588 --> 15:56.771
This is Oxford in England that we're talking about.

15:56.811 --> 15:56.931
Right.

15:57.383 --> 16:22.918
uh but it's an i have it it's very you know very useful book yes and and of course we do the oxford uh book of canadian verse in english and we do the oxford book of canadian short stories in english but those are published by oxford press in canada is is american literature of i notice when i see these tours these tour

16:23.506 --> 16:26.088
lists of where the American authors are going.

16:26.289 --> 16:33.155
Inevitably, if it's even a semi-important book, Toronto will always be on the list.

16:34.556 --> 16:42.883
Is American literature... How is it greeted in Canada, would you say?

16:42.924 --> 16:50.070
Well, in any Canadian bookstore that you walk into, you'll see a huge number of American books.

16:51.591 --> 16:52.332
And...

16:53.965 --> 16:57.769
I would say we can get anything of yours.

16:58.850 --> 17:02.613
You can't necessarily get anything of ours.

17:02.653 --> 17:12.423
Which is really the way it is, unfortunately, with so many other national literatures that American books... It's the small, big thing as well.

17:12.463 --> 17:13.864
Danes have the same thing.

17:13.884 --> 17:22.032
They're so delighted that Smilla's Sense of Snow has done so well because now foreign publishers are at least considering

17:23.412 --> 17:27.855
They're at least reading to consider Scandinavian writers.

17:27.875 --> 17:29.946
Ordinarily, they just don't get a look in.

17:30.314 --> 17:31.416
He's got another book out.

17:32.197 --> 17:33.458
I've had a chance to see it.

17:33.478 --> 17:35.441
I asked that question selfishly.

17:35.461 --> 17:41.530
Earlier this year, I started syndicating myself, and I've got myself in 22 newspapers now.

17:42.211 --> 17:53.807
And what I've targeted basically are university towns like Eugene, Oregon, and I'm in Madison, Wisconsin, and Knoxville, and Gainesville, and Austin, and Toledo, et cetera, and Columbus.

17:54.580 --> 17:58.990
And I thought, you know, my wife and I have just done this this year.

17:59.531 --> 18:00.613
We've got 22 papers.

18:01.676 --> 18:07.970
We were thinking very seriously of trying some Canadian papers to see if they're interested in these interviews that I do, you know.

18:09.092 --> 18:10.656
Well, it wouldn't be out of the question.

18:10.736 --> 18:14.344
On the other hand, I have to say the Canadian papers...

18:14.948 --> 18:16.991
their book coverage has gone down.

18:17.551 --> 18:20.575
Well, you see, that's the kind of thing I'm exploiting.

18:21.016 --> 18:22.938
That's happened everywhere.

18:22.978 --> 18:26.783
On the other hand, there are sort of specialty things that happen.

18:26.823 --> 18:34.613
For instance, some of the book chains have their own newsletters that they put out, and there are things like BC Book World.

18:36.836 --> 18:40.181
So there are books.

18:40.201 --> 18:43.605
If the newspapers didn't work, the book publications...

18:44.075 --> 18:46.999
of that kind might be another possibility.

18:47.319 --> 18:58.273
See, what I've been doing is going for cities where they aren't about to get a Margaret Atwood come into town or a Joe Heller or a John Irving or Doris Lessing, Nadine Gordimer.

18:58.293 --> 19:00.336
These are the authors I do week after week.

19:01.397 --> 19:06.724
And even if they have a full-time book editor, they've found it useful to...

19:06.907 --> 19:09.229
I mean, it's really caught on pretty well.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.492
Toronto is probably not a good bet.

19:11.512 --> 19:12.453
No, because they're too big.

19:12.473 --> 19:13.133
Yeah, they're covered.

19:13.153 --> 19:15.856
But I'm thinking of places like in British Columbia, perhaps.

19:17.978 --> 19:30.491
Quickly, so what would you name, what would you think are some of the better, you don't mind by taking your brains here for about two minutes, just on some of the newspapers, say, outside of Toronto or the areas where there might be strong book periods?

19:30.551 --> 19:32.273
Well, what you have to do is look at who owns them.

19:34.278 --> 19:36.221
See if they're part of the Thompson chain.

19:37.042 --> 19:37.602
That's bad.

19:38.163 --> 19:38.684
Yeah.

19:38.704 --> 19:41.868
Yeah, that's the case down here as well, unfortunately.

19:42.469 --> 19:43.430
Or whether they aren't.

19:44.051 --> 19:46.314
I haven't been able to get into a single Thompson paper.

19:47.135 --> 19:49.358
I've gotten into New York Times papers, L.A.

19:49.418 --> 19:50.300
Times papers.

19:50.400 --> 19:54.405
I've gotten into... Well, Thompson has a reputation for being extremely stingy.

19:54.966 --> 20:01.855
But for a freelancer who offers good stuff at a reasonable rate, you know, it could almost work to your advantage, too.

20:02.628 --> 20:04.673
But anyway, I won't bother you with this stuff.

20:04.894 --> 20:08.564
Mr. Thompson over the head, get him to change his... Yeah.

20:08.664 --> 20:10.008
I'd like it if you could do that.

20:10.148 --> 20:16.425
But Thompson's newspapers as a rule are pretty... But if it's not Thompson, then it'll be somebody else.

20:16.445 --> 20:18.510
For instance, who owns the Montreal Gazette?

20:18.693 --> 20:19.894
Yeah, I've got the E&P.

20:20.395 --> 20:21.496
That's our next badge.

20:21.516 --> 20:23.759
We're going to try some Canadian papers.

20:24.560 --> 20:25.481
I want to let you go, Ms.

20:25.501 --> 20:25.741
Atwood.

20:25.761 --> 20:29.005
I know you have another interview coming up in about three minutes.

20:29.166 --> 20:30.587
Oh, do I?

20:30.868 --> 20:33.291
They told me you had to be off the phone by 11.45.

20:34.913 --> 20:40.679
So I think we've got plenty here to do a nice little piece and look forward.

20:40.900 --> 20:45.325
For heaven's sake, for heaven's sake, they're not newspaper columns.

20:45.929 --> 20:47.003
No, I know that.

20:47.044 --> 20:48.868
I know they're not.

20:51.397 --> 21:01.506
I was trying to spark a response, and I'm afraid I was too successful.

21:01.526 --> 21:04.528
Sometimes you can go a little too far, I'm afraid.

21:04.548 --> 21:06.210
Don't worry, I promise you.

21:07.010 --> 21:16.238
The reason I'm able to get into these good university towns is I think that I do have a sensitivity for what I'm doing, and I do read the books.

21:16.458 --> 21:16.959
Guess what?

21:17.019 --> 21:17.980
You know, that helps, too.

21:18.760 --> 21:20.762
I just did an interview with the Germans.

21:21.113 --> 21:31.026
person, the person of Germanic persuasion, who said, why are you so ironic about academics?

21:33.089 --> 21:37.795
And I said, I didn't think I was any more ironic about academics than about anybody else.

21:37.936 --> 21:48.690
But the academics gave a lot of scope because the gap between what they're teaching and daily life is so large.

21:49.480 --> 22:00.634
On the one hand, you have philosophy and Shakespeare, and on the other hand, you have the staff meeting and power politics and the university, and who didn't wash their coffee cup?

22:02.600 --> 22:02.680
Hmm.

22:03.807 --> 22:07.512
Have you had a chance to read Harold Bloom's book, The Western Campaign?

22:07.532 --> 22:07.873
Not yet.

22:07.893 --> 22:08.714
What's it like?

22:08.734 --> 22:12.019
It's, you know, it's a very, I like it.

22:12.620 --> 22:16.886
I mean, you have to take into account he's a crusty old guy, you know.

22:17.607 --> 22:19.931
But I had a very nice interview with him.

22:20.271 --> 22:21.693
Oh, it's brilliant.

22:21.713 --> 22:22.294
Yeah, it is.

22:22.314 --> 22:33.190
I mean, when you, I think the central 20s, when he's writing about his writers and he's leaving aside the politics, which, you know, which you get in the first and concluding chapter,

22:33.170 --> 22:41.162
Not to say I agree or disagree with him, but when he's writing about, as a critic, the man is brilliant, really.

22:41.883 --> 22:44.526
He really has read the stuff and absorbed it.

22:45.628 --> 22:48.572
Well, I'm glad that he has because that's his job.

22:48.592 --> 22:54.621
Yeah, but I mean, a lot of us, so many people, well, I won't make a comment you can read, but...

22:55.040 --> 22:56.082
But not the way he was.

22:56.242 --> 22:56.422
Yeah.

22:57.384 --> 22:57.985
I'll let you go.

22:58.005 --> 22:59.046
Okay.

22:59.387 --> 22:59.847
Good luck.

22:59.968 --> 23:00.929
Thank you, and you too.

23:00.989 --> 23:03.193
I might try, for instance, Prince George.

23:03.213 --> 23:03.994
Oh, that's a good one.

23:05.296 --> 23:05.937
Actually, it's not.

23:06.217 --> 23:09.242
You were being naughty to me, so I was being naughty.

23:09.262 --> 23:13.368
It's not, huh?

23:13.388 --> 23:13.549
Okay.

23:14.210 --> 23:15.111
Have nice holidays.

23:15.171 --> 23:15.932
You too.

23:16.133 --> 23:16.413
Bye-bye.

23:16.513 --> 23:17.014
Bye-bye.
