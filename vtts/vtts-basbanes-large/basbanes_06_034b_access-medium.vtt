10:46.061 --> 10:46.281
Now to you.

10:46.641 --> 10:47.202
Seventeen hundred dollars.

10:47.222 --> 10:47.522
Now to you.

10:47.542 --> 10:48.103
Seventeen hundred dollars.

10:48.123 --> 10:48.343
Now to you.

10:48.363 --> 10:48.924
Seventeen hundred dollars.

10:48.944 --> 10:49.444
Now to you.

10:49.464 --> 10:49.985
Seventeen hundred dollars.

10:50.005 --> 10:50.225
Now to you.

10:50.245 --> 10:50.846
Seventeen hundred dollars.

10:50.866 --> 10:51.086
Now to you.

10:51.106 --> 10:51.627
Seventeen hundred dollars.

10:51.647 --> 10:51.927
Now to you.

10:51.947 --> 10:52.468
Seventeen hundred dollars.

10:52.488 --> 10:52.708
Now to you.

10:52.728 --> 10:53.249
Seventeen hundred dollars.

10:53.269 --> 10:53.489
Now to you.

10:53.509 --> 10:54.030
Seventeen hundred dollars.

10:54.050 --> 10:54.270
Now to you.

10:54.290 --> 10:55.912
Seventeen hundred dollars.

10:55.932 --> 10:56.152
Now to you.

10:56.172 --> 10:56.753
Seventeen hundred dollars.

10:56.773 --> 10:56.993
Now to you.

10:57.013 --> 10:57.534
Seventeen hundred dollars.

10:57.554 --> 10:57.774
Now to you.

10:57.794 --> 10:58.314
Seventeen hundred dollars.

10:58.334 --> 10:58.555
Now to you.

10:58.575 --> 10:59.095
Seventeen hundred dollars.

10:59.115 --> 10:59.336
Now to you.

10:59.356 --> 10:59.876
Seventeen hundred dollars.

10:59.896 --> 11:00.136
Now to you.

11:00.156 --> 11:00.657
Seventeen hundred dollars

11:05.497 --> 11:07.942
What was your reaction to the sale?

11:07.962 --> 11:08.944
Were you pleased with it?

11:09.045 --> 11:09.967
Well, I was very excited.

11:10.047 --> 11:13.494
I mean, certainly the smaller items are doing incredibly well.

11:13.514 --> 11:14.977
They bought an astonishing price.

11:15.318 --> 11:17.202
It's too bad about the Shakespeare there.

11:17.282 --> 11:22.854
Small items, they're medium items.

11:22.894 --> 11:25.159
Somebody said, they were sitting next to me, they said,

11:25.460 --> 11:30.810
I read a book, and I said, now it doesn't matter.

11:31.131 --> 11:32.133
How about the Shakespeare's?

11:32.153 --> 11:33.115
Shakespeare's too bad.

11:33.155 --> 11:34.578
I mean, it's a disappointment.

11:34.878 --> 11:37.143
What do you attribute that to, too fresh?

11:37.163 --> 11:40.008
Well, they were so fresh, after all, they didn't even bought two years ago.

11:40.429 --> 11:41.391
So what happens to them now?

11:41.411 --> 11:43.094
Do they go back to planning?

11:43.335 --> 11:45.218
Well, yes, they're his.

11:46.360 --> 11:48.244
We'll be talking to them about them.

11:48.562 --> 11:52.671
And they're an extraordinary, extraordinary, extraordinary series of books to have.

11:52.691 --> 11:54.775
You think maybe they're a little over-vegged at $2.5?

11:54.795 --> 11:56.799
$1.5 to $2.5?

11:56.940 --> 11:57.721
How can one say that?

11:57.741 --> 12:01.249
He paid $2.1 for $2 million and $90,000 to be exact.

12:02.111 --> 12:03.053
Where was that underbid?

12:03.814 --> 12:05.698
From the previous sale.

12:05.738 --> 12:06.520
One wonders.

12:06.787 --> 12:08.170
Yes, I agree.

12:08.230 --> 12:09.252
Where was he?

12:09.372 --> 12:12.339
I would have liked to have seen him.

12:12.359 --> 12:13.962
You're taking the words out of my mouth.

12:14.042 --> 12:16.508
I guess the Elliot Bible is my other question.

12:16.568 --> 12:21.238
Well, I think there have been a number on the market recently, and that's probably true.

12:22.300 --> 12:24.745
And so I think that market possibly has a result.

12:25.028 --> 12:25.749
On the whole earth.

12:26.210 --> 12:28.053
But the other things, I mean, look at some of the other clients.

12:28.073 --> 12:29.274
It's astonishing, right?

12:29.294 --> 12:29.955
Oh, it's right, right?

12:30.156 --> 12:30.316
Yeah.

12:30.677 --> 12:33.200
This gentleman, Mr. Weinstein, right?

12:33.341 --> 12:33.841
He helped.

12:33.922 --> 12:34.763
He helped.

12:35.384 --> 12:36.125
He helped.

12:36.205 --> 12:36.846
He helped.

12:36.866 --> 12:37.387
He helped.

12:37.467 --> 12:38.188
He helped.

12:38.488 --> 12:39.510
He helped.

12:39.550 --> 12:40.471
He helped.

12:40.491 --> 12:40.972
He helped.

12:40.992 --> 12:41.373
He helped.

12:42.434 --> 12:43.336
He helped.

12:43.356 --> 12:43.716
He helped.

12:43.736 --> 12:44.538
He helped.

12:44.878 --> 12:45.719
He helped.

12:45.739 --> 12:46.100
He helped.

12:46.180 --> 12:47.041
He helped.

12:47.061 --> 12:47.502
He helped.

12:47.522 --> 12:48.083
He helped.

12:48.282 --> 12:49.464
How are you doing?

12:49.704 --> 12:51.267
I'm fine.

12:51.287 --> 12:53.090
Did you see my piece on the New York Times in April?

12:53.150 --> 12:54.413
Probably not, huh?

12:54.433 --> 12:57.558
Yeah, I probably didn't because I was in Arizona in April.

12:57.578 --> 12:59.101
I had a front page.

12:59.121 --> 13:01.004
I'm excited to show here today.

13:01.024 --> 13:02.346
Well, I'd like to make a contribution.

13:02.406 --> 13:05.451
I feel I have a moral obligation to support my profession.

13:05.471 --> 13:09.258
Now, did it just appear that you were working as a trio today?

13:09.839 --> 13:13.986
We often work together in that

13:14.371 --> 13:22.546
It probably appeared that way more often than not because we consult each other about certain things.

13:22.566 --> 13:24.250
Were you buying collaboratively?

13:24.510 --> 13:27.015
A few items, but mostly we were buying separately.

13:27.035 --> 13:29.600
Were you buying for stock or for clients?

13:30.001 --> 13:32.064
Both.

13:32.125 --> 13:33.547
I mean, I was probably half of the material.

13:33.567 --> 13:37.695
The most expensive thing I bought, the Dickens Bank, I bought for a client.

13:37.844 --> 13:42.570
Do you feel that the market's softening a little bit with the economy?

13:42.590 --> 13:44.632
I feel it should be, but I don't feel it is.

13:44.732 --> 13:55.686
I went to two sales this week, the Christie sale on Tuesday, and there was only two lots bought in, a very modest lot, and this sale here, and it's a surprisingly strong market.

13:55.746 --> 14:03.936
And the only reason I have to believe that it's holding up is because art has become so expensive that people have stepped into books

14:04.304 --> 14:08.412
because $5,000 to $50,000 is the high end for books and the low end for art.

14:08.452 --> 14:11.497
Have you noticed that in Los Angeles?

14:11.517 --> 14:12.159
Well, I haven't.

14:12.399 --> 14:13.661
I've noticed it more in the rooms.

14:14.282 --> 14:19.312
I've noticed there is a reduction of the number of people coming around, certainly during the summer.

14:19.432 --> 14:23.299
But fortunately, you talked to me on a good day, and it's been very busy the last week.

14:23.379 --> 14:25.543
So I said, boy, it's been busy this week.

14:25.563 --> 14:27.527
But one thing good about Seal is that

14:27.862 --> 14:29.224
It generates interest.

14:29.244 --> 14:32.627
Even if I don't buy a book, I create the excitement of a customer.

14:32.648 --> 14:38.995
So if he missed a book for $20,000, I could sell him one in my shop for $15,000 that he was thinking about anyway because he's back in.

14:39.015 --> 14:41.798
And what I really need is momentum.

14:41.818 --> 14:44.201
Seals bring about that kind of momentum.

14:44.221 --> 14:47.364
How come you didn't go for the Tamerlane?

14:48.225 --> 14:49.327
Because I'm a catalyst.

14:50.228 --> 14:51.750
I believe I have to make a profit on it.

14:51.850 --> 14:53.351
And I would have bought it $120,000.

14:53.371 --> 14:56.535
$110,000 was my bid to sell it for $175,000.

14:56.785 --> 14:59.749
Of course, if the last one bought 150, I think that you sell.

14:59.909 --> 15:00.671
Yeah, right.

15:00.731 --> 15:04.276
And so, and it's not a strong market, say, on the high-end items.

15:04.596 --> 15:08.522
Because obviously, the higher the price, like a pyramid, the smaller, fewer people are.

15:08.602 --> 15:09.603
And Dick's out of the pool.

15:09.724 --> 15:13.369
Because if you could deal with the integrated to Dick, I'd look like this one.

15:13.910 --> 15:14.891
I saw Dick.

15:15.171 --> 15:17.355
Bill's self, his last trip, as a matter of fact.

15:17.375 --> 15:18.036
Yeah, he was here.

15:18.316 --> 15:19.357
Was Bill here today?

15:19.397 --> 15:20.759
Yeah, he was here today.

15:20.900 --> 15:21.821
He took him yesterday as a viewing.

15:21.861 --> 15:22.482
He was here today.

15:23.343 --> 15:23.624
I missed him.

15:24.304 --> 15:25.026
Might have to walk out there.

15:25.046 --> 15:26.067
Somebody's standing there waiting for him.
