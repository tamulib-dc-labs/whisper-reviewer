WEBVTT

00:03.085 --> 00:05.969
Okay, we're on again.

00:08.012 --> 00:09.133
Where was that?

00:09.153 --> 00:10.415
You do put out catalogues.

00:10.595 --> 00:10.976
No, I don't.

00:11.536 --> 00:15.482
I did for the first several years, but I don't put out any catalogues, no.

00:15.622 --> 00:16.162
But how does it work?

00:16.183 --> 00:17.144
I don't like soliciting.

00:17.224 --> 00:29.520
I don't like asking people to buy things, and I very much dislike the letter that comes back saying no.

00:30.442 --> 00:31.583
I find that humiliating.

00:31.663 --> 00:33.025
I don't like doing the whole thing.

00:33.157 --> 00:37.243
demeaning, exactly.

00:38.524 --> 00:41.709
It sounds like you have a rather unusual procedure.

00:41.729 --> 00:44.953
I think every bookseller is unusual and is himself.

00:45.794 --> 00:51.922
And as long as enough things happen during the year, that's fine.

00:52.423 --> 01:01.375
I'm not ambitious to get the greatest this or that or some wonderful conspicuous object at a sale.

01:03.194 --> 01:05.278
And I'd rather do slightly different things.

01:06.781 --> 01:07.382
Well, what happens?

01:07.422 --> 01:12.612
You acquire things, and then you think it might be right for a certain collector?

01:13.053 --> 01:22.991
No, I like to keep what I've just got for a while, and I'd much prefer it if somebody comes in and chooses something that's been here.

01:23.091 --> 01:24.434
So really that's what happens.

01:24.454 --> 01:25.596
People come and look.

01:25.616 --> 01:26.097
Yes.

01:26.633 --> 01:28.796
You don't alert them?

01:28.956 --> 01:30.438
I do now.

01:30.578 --> 01:38.128
I mean, I was even more remote, and for nine years of the 20, I think it was, got fed up with book fairs and didn't exhibit at all.

01:38.208 --> 01:50.363
Now, I do go to, I do exhibit at the London Book Fair in the summer, and exhibit it in Los Angeles this winter, and may exhibit it in New York next.

01:50.630 --> 01:55.137
We do that occasionally because I think it's necessary to appear occasionally.

01:55.578 --> 02:00.085
And of course I like my bookselling colleagues very much and it's a very friendly club to be in.

02:01.908 --> 02:02.910
So people will come in?

02:05.634 --> 02:07.657
And on the whole not riffle through the shelves.

02:07.717 --> 02:13.887
They don't like that happening unless I know somebody rather well.

02:14.575 --> 02:17.519
People just, and I don't mark prices in my books.

02:17.539 --> 02:21.043
I don't like surrounding myself with prices.

02:21.544 --> 02:23.706
I can look up anything that anybody wants to know.

02:23.747 --> 02:30.175
The system here is that if you're interested in something, we put it out on the table, and I tell you what it costs.

02:30.195 --> 02:32.518
So after you look around, you go to it.

02:32.538 --> 02:34.060
Or if you ask.

02:34.120 --> 02:34.780
If you ask.

02:34.840 --> 02:36.903
If you ask, that's right, yes.

02:36.923 --> 02:38.906
We establish interest first.

02:38.926 --> 02:39.386
Yes.

02:40.187 --> 02:41.629
And the prices.

02:42.520 --> 02:44.925
Otherwise, people just, I mean, I do the same.

02:44.965 --> 02:47.810
In our shops, cool things, I just see the price, shove them back.

02:47.850 --> 02:51.497
I want to see if I, especially if it's something that I have.

02:51.517 --> 02:52.018
Exactly, yeah.

02:52.359 --> 02:54.042
I want to see if I pay too much.

02:54.984 --> 03:04.663
You did say something briefly about you had an attitude bordering on contempt for those who collect modern for us, particularly with the recession.

03:04.930 --> 03:07.074
It's not to go on about that.

03:07.094 --> 03:12.322
I wouldn't like to say I feel contempt for the people who do it.

03:12.362 --> 03:15.007
They're welcome to their own idiosyncrasies in collecting.

03:16.389 --> 03:18.993
As a collecting subject, I feel it's a very stupid one.

03:19.814 --> 03:22.018
Why do you say that?

03:22.038 --> 03:31.714
Because really very insignificant mass-produced objects of recent vintage

03:32.133 --> 03:42.084
are hyped up to high prices through, I mean, probably through the need to discover a new collecting subject, and... Making it an industry, in other words.

03:43.726 --> 03:44.888
You know, making it fashion.

03:45.929 --> 03:47.951
But there has always been fashion in football.

03:48.131 --> 03:49.433
Yes, but of all silly ones.

03:49.633 --> 03:53.077
I can't think of any that's climbed lower than that.

03:54.879 --> 03:58.343
When you...

03:58.998 --> 04:02.863
You can climb down as far as you climb up.

04:03.023 --> 04:15.440
I think when I realized that a James Bond book or Dorothy Sayers book or something, if it has its dust jacket on, it's valued highly.

04:15.540 --> 04:17.603
Stephen King is really the one.

04:17.623 --> 04:18.664
Stephen King, I don't even know.

04:18.704 --> 04:20.647
He's the horror writer.

04:20.667 --> 04:22.349
Horror writer, yes.

04:23.450 --> 04:25.373
There's people who think of things.

04:25.393 --> 04:27.756
Yes, yes, yes.

04:28.023 --> 04:40.376
I think it's a dull-witted form of collecting, and a fashion of the moment, and the things are, so much is published, so much rubbish is published, so many people collect, that this satisfies the demand.

04:41.477 --> 04:47.903
It does make the exercise accessible, however, to more people.

04:47.923 --> 04:48.924
I think that's how it's happened.

04:48.964 --> 04:53.389
Because so many of the other great things are going to happen.

04:53.892 --> 04:57.556
And that really is so pricey that you can afford it for a focus.

04:57.576 --> 04:57.656
Yes.

04:57.736 --> 04:59.158
But you're not really collecting art.

04:59.198 --> 05:02.462
You're doing something which people are doing.

05:02.502 --> 05:03.483
It's like baseball cards.

05:03.543 --> 05:05.425
And everybody's doing it, sort of.

05:05.445 --> 05:08.989
You're trying to get a full run of baseball cards, you know, for the 1951.

05:09.149 --> 05:11.792
You only have baseball cards, but that's an ephemeral thing.

05:12.273 --> 05:12.673
Yes.

05:13.474 --> 05:14.876
I suppose.

05:15.116 --> 05:19.541
What is your focus, or is it mainly things that please you?

05:19.561 --> 05:20.642
Mainly things that please me?

05:21.095 --> 05:22.016
The focus changes.

05:22.156 --> 05:37.491
I think the bookseller's luck and the pleasure is, or can be, that he can be a specialist, but he's not to be a specialist in that some new subject can excite.

05:37.511 --> 05:44.918
And I'm actually much not very thrilled these days with, say, the great private presses and so on.

05:45.439 --> 05:46.299
I've been through that.

05:46.400 --> 05:47.300
I've travelled there.

05:47.340 --> 05:48.942
I don't want to do it again.

05:50.035 --> 05:51.978
It was an exciting thing that I know.

05:52.118 --> 05:53.480
I mean, it's not particularly arrogant to say it.

05:53.500 --> 05:53.941
I know it.

05:54.602 --> 06:00.231
You didn't say I grew up or I passed through that phase.

06:00.251 --> 06:01.352
You didn't say that.

06:01.372 --> 06:03.075
I haven't actually passed through the phase.

06:03.455 --> 06:09.645
If offered a collection, I'd really like to say yes, because I still enjoy the book, but it's not really my thing.

06:10.266 --> 06:12.369
Well, what really excites you now?

06:12.389 --> 06:18.979
Well, I mean, temporarily and for the moment, and I'm writing about it, is 18th century editions and editors of Shakespeare.

06:19.685 --> 06:36.713
which has been a fun thing that somehow absorbed me, and which I think was not being looked at, and it was possible to collect them, and now I'm writing a book about them, and the editors, and the editing, and the illustrations, and so on.

06:36.993 --> 06:41.761
But now you have acquired, you've put together a collection of these, right?

06:41.781 --> 06:41.861
Yes.

06:41.881 --> 06:43.684
What if one of your customers comes in

06:44.187 --> 06:49.516
I wouldn't dream of splitting it up.

06:50.077 --> 06:55.926
I might, of course, one day sell the whole thing as a collection, or might not, depends how life goes.

06:57.369 --> 07:08.367
We have a private collection, which I like to defend and not sell, and don't keep in this room, therefore, of Japanese things, because we've been a certain amount to Japan.

07:08.748 --> 07:10.110
Did you go to the Mary Heights sale?

07:10.782 --> 07:14.310
No, I was interested to learn the results.

07:14.470 --> 07:16.033
I certainly didn't want to go and buy that.

07:16.093 --> 07:18.920
It was the same Japanese dealer who sold it all to her.

07:18.940 --> 07:20.503
Yes, I bought things from him, yes.

07:20.523 --> 07:21.806
He kept his hand back.

07:21.826 --> 07:23.730
He bought a lot back, yes.

07:23.750 --> 07:24.953
It was a delightful story.

07:24.973 --> 07:26.135
Yes.

07:26.155 --> 07:27.237
Princeton was quite nipped.

07:27.278 --> 07:29.382
They thought that collection was going together.

07:29.513 --> 07:31.737
Oh, yes.

07:31.757 --> 07:32.779
But she did a good thing.

07:32.799 --> 07:34.361
She was helping the Morgan Library.

07:34.381 --> 07:37.447
I could never see the point of selling books in order to help a library.

07:37.487 --> 07:40.271
Why didn't she just give the books to the Morgan Library?

07:40.552 --> 07:43.196
Libraries spend so much on buildings and so little on books.

07:43.317 --> 07:50.529
And I'm sure that with their endowments, that really shouldn't be a problem for them to get the money.

07:50.549 --> 07:52.332
I did not think so, but apparently it was.

07:52.514 --> 07:57.159
I think if they'd got the money and she'd given the books to the library, that would have been a much more sensible idea.

07:57.259 --> 08:06.268
That collection, you know, it was in our country, I would say this country, this is Great Britain, but I mean, that was really quite an extraordinary collection in the United States.

08:06.328 --> 08:08.471
Yes, very good, yes.

08:08.491 --> 08:11.334
She is an extraordinary collection, isn't she?

08:11.354 --> 08:22.285
Yes, she's an even older generation than I am, so I've not really known Mary Hyde, although... Alfred Freeman feels that she was the greatest moving collector, if I was asked.

08:22.484 --> 08:25.830
I wouldn't use the word great of any collector because I don't think it's a great activity.

08:27.774 --> 08:27.874
Okay.

08:27.894 --> 08:31.321
The most accomplished, the most... I mean, I wouldn't use the word great.

08:31.902 --> 08:34.106
But she's the most accomplished collector.

08:34.126 --> 08:35.870
She may have the best... I don't know what he means.

08:35.890 --> 08:36.571
Well, all right.

08:36.591 --> 08:38.334
What little collector impresses you most?

08:39.657 --> 08:40.559
No collector impresses me.

08:40.579 --> 08:41.701
It just means flourishing money.

08:42.763 --> 08:43.885
I think that...

08:44.202 --> 08:48.710
She's got fairly obvious middle-of-the-road subjects, such as Johnson and Oswald.

08:48.910 --> 08:50.253
But I feel you've done it rather well.

08:50.754 --> 08:51.936
Well, how do you do it well?

08:51.976 --> 08:57.265
It just means you buy a lot, and you're told by your dealers, or you see in catalogs what's going, and you acquire it.

08:57.305 --> 08:58.868
I don't think it is a great activity.

08:58.908 --> 09:04.097
It's nice to put... You have spent your life at this.

09:04.117 --> 09:04.738
No.

09:04.758 --> 09:05.299
You love it.

09:05.380 --> 09:07.623
I enjoy buying things and having things.

09:07.643 --> 09:11.308
I told you how you lingered longer at the bookstores when you were in publishing.

09:11.328 --> 09:14.712
Yes, but I have no illusion that I was doing anything very noble.

09:15.913 --> 09:18.076
But where would we be without collectors?

09:18.597 --> 09:22.322
I mean, there would be no bailiff about Robert Cotton.

09:22.342 --> 09:23.703
I think it's a lot of fun.

09:23.723 --> 09:29.270
I think it's a lot of fun to acquire books, but I don't think it's particularly skilled.

09:29.310 --> 09:32.334
Do you?

09:32.354 --> 09:35.218
Well, I think it's skilled.

09:35.789 --> 09:40.576
Well, I'll tell you, I was really impressed by some of the things of Leonard Baskin's house.

09:40.596 --> 09:43.300
Leonard, I think, is... I would agree with you.

09:43.340 --> 09:47.366
I think Leonard is quite... He has an eye for things that nobody even knows exist.

09:47.406 --> 09:48.328
Exactly.

09:48.348 --> 09:59.364
Leonard is very exceptional among collectors in that he has an artist's eye for things which other people are not particularly noticing.

09:59.384 --> 10:00.927
He doesn't buy the fashionable thing.

10:01.788 --> 10:04.632
He gets excited by a thing.

10:05.168 --> 10:09.454
I use the word, but he never even knew it existed before.

10:10.676 --> 10:10.776
Yes.

10:10.796 --> 10:13.019
But he conceived.

10:13.079 --> 10:13.439
Yes.

10:13.500 --> 10:14.040
I quite agree.

10:14.060 --> 10:24.034
Leonard has been a great influence on me in my... I mean, I've learnt a taste for various things.

10:24.134 --> 10:27.920
Leonard taught me the taste for various things which I've been enthusiastic about.

10:28.721 --> 10:29.642
He's an original man.

10:31.825 --> 10:32.526
And...

10:34.193 --> 10:39.020
Whereas I would say Mary Hyde is probably not an original woman.

10:39.261 --> 10:42.105
Oscar Wilde, Johnson, people have thought of them before.

10:43.107 --> 11:02.817
Leonard in his knowledge of and his collecting of early colour printing, for instance, and some of the 17th century etchers and engravers was very original and I think he feels some contempt for those who collect middle of the road stuff.

11:03.775 --> 11:06.078
Yes.

11:06.098 --> 11:09.263
And you're working on his book, I believe, right?

11:09.283 --> 11:24.084
No, I had a nice invitation out of the blue, we've known each other for many years, to write an essay for his catalog of his retrospective exhibition printing.

11:24.565 --> 11:33.377
So I was pleased to accept his invitation, but said I must come and stay with him, work from his books in his house and talk with him.

11:34.792 --> 11:36.154
And this happened in January.

11:36.194 --> 11:41.822
We went over and stayed a fortnight there, and I enjoyed that very much and wrote his essay, and that's that.

11:42.863 --> 11:43.965
So you did write the essay?

11:43.985 --> 11:46.648
Yes, I wrote it very carefully, so.

11:46.728 --> 11:48.932
So that will be coming out, I guess, next year?

11:48.952 --> 11:55.421
End of next year, it will be the letterpress of his catalogue, you see, in that part of that bibliography.

11:55.441 --> 12:00.467
How do you judge him as a contestant?

12:00.748 --> 12:03.752
That's a very interesting...

12:04.053 --> 12:09.461
It's a very interesting exercise that Lennon was involved in.

12:09.641 --> 12:10.142
Yes.

12:10.162 --> 12:12.205
Well, the Gehenna Press and all this, yes, yes.

12:12.245 --> 12:16.892
Well, I've written about that now, and I'm happy to show you what I wrote, if you'd like to.

12:16.912 --> 12:17.052
Really?

12:17.092 --> 12:17.353
Yes.

12:17.473 --> 12:19.015
Is this something that's published?

12:19.516 --> 12:21.118
No, it will be published in that thing.

12:21.199 --> 12:23.742
I mean, it shouldn't be used before then, I suppose.

12:23.802 --> 12:26.647
It will be out when, next year or this year?

12:26.667 --> 12:30.212
Next year is his exhibition.

12:30.884 --> 12:31.965
Anyway, I think highly of it.

12:32.226 --> 12:38.032
I'd kind of like to see it, but my publication deadline is a year from now.

12:39.154 --> 12:39.454
Yes.

12:42.237 --> 12:45.902
Well, I would say I'm happy for you to see it.

12:45.942 --> 12:48.905
Ask Leonard if you want to quote from it or anything.

12:49.226 --> 12:54.732
It would not appear until afterwards it was published, in any case, until your thing was published.

12:55.049 --> 12:57.293
I mean, you know the Baskins.

12:57.593 --> 13:03.262
My manuscript deadline is a year from now, which is practically speaking, I'm not coming out until 1992, I don't think.

13:03.282 --> 13:05.786
Yes, yes, that's the way it publishes, yes.

13:06.067 --> 13:09.592
So I would not beat you to the punch.

13:09.652 --> 13:11.195
Yes, I'm not worried.

13:11.215 --> 13:13.038
I'm sorry, I'm looking for the order.

13:13.138 --> 13:17.304
I want to get as much as I can.

13:17.325 --> 13:21.411
Yes, well, he was happy with it, sir.

13:22.167 --> 13:22.908
I'm very lucky.

13:23.148 --> 13:26.891
He has never talked to anybody about his book collectors before.

13:27.051 --> 13:28.192
Has he not?

13:28.293 --> 13:28.933
I'm the first one.

13:28.953 --> 13:29.033
Yes.

13:29.113 --> 13:31.235
You're the first writer he's talked about.

13:31.255 --> 13:31.996
I'm the first writer.

13:32.016 --> 13:32.256
Yes.

13:32.757 --> 13:34.418
Well, I mean, I'm not that as a writer.

13:34.618 --> 13:34.898
Yes.

13:35.059 --> 13:36.860
I was invited to the home as a writer.

13:36.900 --> 13:37.140
Yes.

13:37.661 --> 13:42.305
His book collecting has changed, of course, because he sold a tremendous lot of books.

13:43.726 --> 13:44.948
Almost unique in every day.

13:44.968 --> 13:47.210
He's a collector.

13:47.230 --> 13:49.812
I mean, still a very obsessed and dedicated collector.

13:49.832 --> 13:50.012
Yes.

13:50.452 --> 13:52.174
Who will sell things that he loves.

13:52.458 --> 13:56.744
the graces, the tears of his insides, the real arts with them.

13:57.045 --> 13:58.226
And I said, Leonard, why?

13:58.246 --> 14:00.369
And he goes, I said, what is that?

14:00.389 --> 14:02.633
I kind of said, tape recorder can't pick that up.

14:02.653 --> 14:05.056
He said, money, money, any of the money.

14:05.617 --> 14:06.919
No, Leonard never has any money.

14:07.119 --> 14:08.441
And he does.

14:08.461 --> 14:14.770
He has a French expression, how you're on something, an agent of dealer collectibles.

14:14.952 --> 14:23.462
It's not rare that people do sell things in order to acquire the thing.

14:23.743 --> 14:25.765
That's not rare.

14:26.446 --> 14:27.487
Or exchange things.

14:28.408 --> 14:31.212
It is interesting that his wife is also a collector.

14:31.232 --> 14:32.894
Yes.

14:32.914 --> 14:33.194
Yes.

14:33.695 --> 14:35.137
Do you know the Gershbaugh's author?

14:35.157 --> 14:35.417
Yes.

14:35.437 --> 14:36.698
I've talked to him.

14:36.718 --> 14:37.920
He's got a magnificent collection.

14:38.561 --> 14:43.727
He has a couple of examples in that show at the Morgan right now when he eliminated, the Dutch illuminated death.

14:45.293 --> 14:55.346
I'm not going to take up too much more of your time, sir.

14:55.506 --> 14:55.926
All right.

14:55.946 --> 14:57.008
Well, it's been fun.

14:57.208 --> 15:00.292
I would like to contact you again if that's okay.

15:00.492 --> 15:01.133
Yes, of course.

15:01.173 --> 15:06.620
I am planning a second visit in late summer, early fall.

15:06.660 --> 15:07.681
Yes.

15:07.701 --> 15:09.023
Do you think there's anything I missed?

15:09.610 --> 15:11.592
Do you think we've hit the high points?

15:11.972 --> 15:18.118
No, we talk and we'd probably repeat ourselves and talk about it.

15:18.458 --> 15:21.561
But no, that's been interesting for me.

15:21.581 --> 15:22.943
Thank you.

15:22.963 --> 15:23.523
I wish you well.

15:23.723 --> 15:25.865
Does it sound what I'm doing to be interesting?

15:26.086 --> 15:26.646
Yes, it does.

15:26.666 --> 15:30.250
I think it's a very wide canvas.

15:30.330 --> 15:34.093
You are a man who's spent some time in publishing, so I'm interested in that.

15:34.113 --> 15:34.814
Well, all right.

15:34.834 --> 15:39.178
Well, if I were to sort of put on my publishing hat after listening to what you've been saying,

15:39.597 --> 16:08.980
you're taking a very wide sweep as you first described it to me historically and so on and I think from a publishing point of view I tend to say that I tend to say that much the most interesting part of what you've undertaken is the modern one because you see after all people have written about written to extinction about the

16:09.837 --> 16:21.508
we've agreed, or we've disagreed, that the word great collector is not a valid phrase, because collectors aren't great by being collectors, but the major collectors of years ago, people have written a lot about them.

16:22.570 --> 16:30.097
Nicholas Barker's written about them, and so on and so on, and I'm not awfully interested to read any more about Thomas Phillips, and so on and so on.

16:30.117 --> 16:30.597
He won't.

16:30.617 --> 16:36.283
He'll be there, but... Yes, but I think if you're talking about the collector's mentality,

16:36.787 --> 16:38.189
You have to read Dibdin, of course.

16:38.229 --> 16:39.290
You will have read Dibdin.

16:39.310 --> 16:43.136
I have acquired Dibdin in first edition.

16:45.258 --> 16:56.614
But what you say about present-day collecting and its motives and how... You see, for a long time, I think, books and prices made some sense.

16:57.475 --> 17:00.038
And books weren't up in the art world of nonsense.

17:01.460 --> 17:04.144
And now I think they are spiralling up towards

17:05.356 --> 17:09.562
rich nonsense, which has nothing to do with books anymore.

17:09.582 --> 17:10.904
And that's it for you.

17:11.645 --> 17:19.717
Do you really think there's stuff that fascinates people?

17:19.737 --> 17:20.137
To read?

17:20.178 --> 17:22.841
Yeah, because I think it's good gossip.

17:22.861 --> 17:26.527
I think it's... And two of the chapters are gossip chapters.

17:26.707 --> 17:27.068
Yes.

17:27.528 --> 17:29.872
Well, that's all right.

17:29.892 --> 17:32.916
The garden collection story is

17:33.571 --> 17:34.752
Everybody's going to go to that.

17:36.154 --> 17:37.835
The knowledgeable book crowd is going to go.

17:37.855 --> 17:40.358
They're desperate to find out what I have.

17:40.538 --> 17:41.539
A lot of people are.

17:41.619 --> 17:47.925
I mean, I got my ticket to Bill Scheide's house, but he wanted to hear what I put together on Hayden and War.

17:47.985 --> 17:50.007
I mean, I'll be honest with you.

17:50.227 --> 17:54.391
And then he brought out the Gutenberg Bible.

17:54.912 --> 18:00.237
And the Texas story, I think, will be of interest to some people.

18:00.706 --> 18:06.834
And I've got a couple of other very interesting stories.

18:06.854 --> 18:10.919
I'm not doing anything on Johnny Jenkins because it's been done to death.

18:10.939 --> 18:12.982
You're very well done in the New Yorker.

18:13.062 --> 18:15.605
Yeah, that was a great piece in the New Yorker.

18:15.625 --> 18:17.387
There's a case now... But he's not.

18:17.447 --> 18:18.629
I mean, he wasn't a great collector.

18:18.769 --> 18:22.133
He wasn't a great dealer either.

18:22.373 --> 18:23.855
No, I mean, he was a Texan.

18:24.136 --> 18:26.379
He was a Texan with very little taste.

18:26.479 --> 18:29.903
An interesting story, but it's been done.

18:30.794 --> 18:32.756
So his name will mention, I'll mention him.

18:32.816 --> 18:34.197
It'll probably show up in the index.

18:37.060 --> 18:39.462
Yeah, I have to go over this with my editor.

18:39.482 --> 18:41.084
Maybe they want two bargains, why not?

18:41.284 --> 18:42.145
Yes, yes.

18:42.265 --> 18:44.207
But maybe do the contemporary one first.

18:44.507 --> 18:46.029
You see, I have to establish a base.

18:46.069 --> 18:47.730
My title, I have a wonderful title.

18:48.391 --> 18:58.601
You just told me I should, you just suggested that my, you like the gentlest of infirmities better than the gentle madness.

18:58.621 --> 18:59.001
Yeah.

18:59.081 --> 19:00.683
Okay, and then you said,

19:01.085 --> 19:09.415
Well, taking up your phrase of the gentlest of infirmities is becoming more vicious, because in, was it Isaiah Thomas, is it?

19:09.536 --> 19:17.806
In his day, it was open to quite a modest, was he a modest country printer?

19:17.826 --> 19:19.508
He was to begin with, he made his money, no doubt.

19:19.528 --> 19:20.850
He became the most prosperous printer.

19:20.930 --> 19:24.815
He became the most prosperous printer, but he'd probably collect pretty well without being prosperous.

19:24.835 --> 19:27.698
He was born, well, what he collected was ephemera.

19:27.838 --> 19:28.599
Yes.

19:28.659 --> 19:29.100
Junk.

19:29.232 --> 19:34.358
what was considered junk, no way tickets, newspapers, brightsides, almanacs.

19:35.018 --> 19:39.664
He is one of these collectors that if he didn't exist, these things wouldn't exist.

19:39.684 --> 19:39.764
Yes.

19:39.864 --> 19:48.233
I only mean now, without comparing with him, that it's a calculating major thing to buy a decent book.

19:48.253 --> 19:48.794
Big bucks.

19:49.515 --> 19:50.636
Big bucks.

19:50.856 --> 19:58.024
And you think a lot, unless you're very rich in money, it doesn't matter, which is the least desirable sort of collector.

19:58.561 --> 20:04.548
You, with exceptions, I mean, I don't mean a rich person can't be a nice guy, can of course.

20:06.470 --> 20:11.275
Nor do I mean that he must be a nice guy because he's rich, which is a common Southern American ethic, of course.

20:11.976 --> 20:17.942
And therefore, a lot of the charmers left it.

20:19.084 --> 20:26.712
Because when you go and... I used to go, I mean, for myself, I used to be able to go

20:27.535 --> 20:54.336
In my first bookselling years, across to Paris, it was an easy thing to do from here, an hour to the airport and spend the day in Paris, come back in the evening or not, and go to a bookseller, I mean, one of several, and not to visit a number of booksellers, that wouldn't be the way of it there at all, but to go to a bookseller, look at several books he might show me in the morning,

20:55.919 --> 21:00.627
I probably didn't dare ask the price, not because I was frightened to know the answer, but because there wasn't good manners.

21:02.470 --> 21:04.614
I'm not talking about 1880, I'm talking about 1973.

21:07.158 --> 21:13.769
And then we'd go out to lunch together, talk about things, and eat well and drink well.

21:13.829 --> 21:16.935
And then he would judge quite shrewdly.

21:16.975 --> 21:21.302
That was not a bad moment when we went back to his place again to explain about prices.

21:23.071 --> 21:44.222
And I would realize this was a bit more than I should be spending, but fortified with pretty good mar de Bourgogne and so on, I would take two decisions that perhaps I shouldn't have taken, go back feeling very content with life, wake up at almost two in the morning realizing I'd ruin my family once more, and slowly digest it into the bloodstream.

21:44.802 --> 21:45.844
That was very nice.

21:45.924 --> 21:51.492
Well, now I can't behave like that because the decisions are too large.

21:53.024 --> 21:54.846
I'm going to Paris in about ten days' time.

21:55.367 --> 22:17.496
I shan't behave like that because something that was costing then several thousand pounds would now be up to like forty and fifty thousand pounds, which isn't the sort of sum I spend except once in the bluest moon, you see.

22:18.168 --> 22:21.673
So a lot... It's not done frivolously over a nice bottle of wine.

22:21.993 --> 22:26.519
It isn't a kind of minor, relatively minor decision that... All things are relative.

22:26.599 --> 22:34.910
It isn't a relatively minor decision that I'm just willing to take and swallow and live with and enjoy and convince myself that it's marvellous and so on.

22:35.631 --> 22:36.512
It would be a big thing.

22:37.133 --> 22:39.716
And I don't like big things very much anymore.

22:40.918 --> 22:43.461
Big decisions about things that involve money.

22:43.522 --> 22:44.463
I'm not too keen on that.

22:46.205 --> 22:46.926
So...

22:47.598 --> 22:49.591
No, I'm not in favour of stress of that sort.

22:51.263 --> 22:53.055
Well, I would like to get in touch with you again.

22:53.115 --> 22:53.558
Yes.
