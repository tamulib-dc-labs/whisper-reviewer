WEBVTT

00:03.018 --> 00:10.170
This is a very complex title.

00:11.391 --> 00:25.414
Well, here all this level is devoted to digital program and we digitize text

00:25.833 --> 00:35.387
Another part is digital images, but the main program is about digitization of text.

00:36.588 --> 00:46.403
Our goal, our target is to digitize 100,000 books or periodicals.

00:47.084 --> 00:50.929
That means about 30 million pages.

00:51.230 --> 00:59.220
which is a huge, tremendous, foolish program, one of the most important in the world.

01:00.101 --> 01:14.638
And since 1991, 1992, this team here had begun to select and digitize all these holdings, all these materials.

01:15.192 --> 01:19.498
I will come back on the criteria which is the main point.

01:19.999 --> 01:33.437
So we have here a team which is a scientific team, Politique Scientifique de Numerisation, and another one is a technical team, they give orders

01:33.822 --> 02:00.403
uh to uh private companies to uh digitize uh in the format we we want or something like that so it is then you contract out yeah it's not done yeah yes it's private all the work done inside is the intellectual and scientific choice of books and all the technical is out

02:00.772 --> 02:16.148
external outsourced so here i'm in charge of a team of about 10 persons who are specialized in

02:16.550 --> 02:39.739
in one discipline, in one domain, literature, philosophy, history, history of science, history of law, political sciences, economics, anthropology, and we have... Sorry, I will...

02:39.989 --> 02:47.659
We have also a lot of colleagues from research, scientists.

02:47.779 --> 02:52.585
We don't directly all select by ourselves.

02:52.605 --> 03:05.001
We are intermediate between colleagues from university, from inside the library, but also scientific competencies outside the library.

03:04.981 --> 03:26.179
But all the work to do is to find books or periodicals which are both important, intellectually important, whenever they belong to a period or a discipline,

03:26.513 --> 03:48.133
but who are also scarce books, or rare books, or difficult to find, or books not republished, or books not known, in fact, or material

03:49.092 --> 04:11.505
we deserve to be wider distributed yes how about condition does condition play a part if the condition is poor we use the phrase brittle books yes this physical situation is important of course but it's ever

04:11.806 --> 04:26.659
chains are a problem because sometimes these materials are so brittle that we could not use it to be reproduced

04:26.858 --> 04:45.576
Well, it's a bit difficult to convince our colleagues, our curator's colleagues, that because this is a brittle book to be conserved, to be restored, we have also to reproduce it.

04:45.961 --> 04:55.149
Sometimes they have the idea that it will be another damage to reproduce it.

04:55.830 --> 04:57.091
Do you understand?

04:57.151 --> 05:00.714
I understand perfectly.

05:00.734 --> 05:09.963
Because the book is recently restored, rebinded, they don't want to be brittle again.

05:11.284 --> 05:14.867
We have a lot of problems to access to the material source.

05:14.887 --> 05:15.968
This is very important.

05:15.948 --> 05:20.153
So if a book is... Merci beaucoup, Hélène.

05:22.816 --> 05:24.858
Merci.

05:24.878 --> 05:33.208
Sorry, I have chosen some texts, mostly in French, but one or two are in English.

05:33.368 --> 05:35.770
But I can work with some French texts.

05:36.011 --> 05:36.391
Okay.

05:37.913 --> 05:44.200
About what we are doing on a larger scope, what is the...

05:44.500 --> 05:47.585
the digital project inside.

05:47.905 --> 05:52.793
If you have some French text, I'd be happy to take them, because I can work with them.

05:52.813 --> 05:53.775
Well, we will come back.

05:53.815 --> 05:54.596
Okay, good.

05:55.457 --> 06:07.977
So, you see, in some places in the United States, if a book is really brittle, they feel that perhaps it can't be used again anyway, and maybe you should make a digital copy.

06:08.648 --> 06:12.193
And then maybe dispose of the book or whatever.

06:12.214 --> 06:13.035
You don't do that.

06:13.496 --> 06:20.446
You don't dispose of a book once it's been copied.

06:20.767 --> 06:21.047
No.

06:21.067 --> 06:26.416
Your question is, are there still on excess?

06:27.677 --> 06:37.052
Are there situations where you will digitize a book and then because you have to sometimes cut the pages, take the book apart, right?

06:37.235 --> 06:39.218
Don't they have to do that sometimes?

06:39.238 --> 07:05.098
Well, we have done it from a part of this collection, with books we have bought on this purpose, from second-hand books, antiquaria, and we are seeking a lot of catalogues of antiquaria,

07:05.348 --> 07:10.034
to buy books to cut it and to digitize them.

07:10.054 --> 07:25.453
And on the other side, we have reproduced first by photography, micrography, and then only digitized this microphone.

07:25.833 --> 07:27.255
So let me understand.

07:28.113 --> 07:44.248
your copy of the book, the one that Bibliotech National, you will not cut up or keep that, but if you can find a duplicate from a book dealer, not too much expensive, you'll buy this copy,

07:44.228 --> 07:54.595
Yes, and we could rebind it again, but of course, well, it's another expense.

07:54.736 --> 07:56.260
Because it is expensive, by the way.

07:56.280 --> 07:58.305
It's rather expensive, yes.

07:58.505 --> 08:16.765
You have to have a balance between the price you pay for this double or... I think something that interests both of us is selecting the 100,000 books out of 10 million books.

08:16.986 --> 08:19.468
You're selecting 100,000.

08:19.508 --> 08:21.991
1%, I guess that is, whatever it is.

08:24.174 --> 08:27.297
You've given us a rough idea, of course, the importance, the scarcity.

08:28.238 --> 08:32.766
But the curators and the librarians must have a tremendous amount of influence.

08:33.909 --> 08:34.309
Yes.

08:34.610 --> 08:36.513
Of which books will make it and which ones won't.

08:36.534 --> 08:36.894
Of course.

08:38.417 --> 08:49.458
Well, until now we were rather, let's say, not alone, but autonomous.

08:49.638 --> 08:50.259
Autonomous.

08:50.279 --> 08:51.782
Yes.

08:52.370 --> 09:02.412
On this project, we have to achieve this goal.

09:02.472 --> 09:10.530
It was rather hard work because it means

09:10.932 --> 09:15.938
almost an average of 400 choices by month by a man.

09:16.559 --> 09:18.842
Yes, 400 choices.

09:19.303 --> 09:38.307
Because afterwards we have to give all this material, paper or microphone, to the company who are waiting, the contractors, who are waiting to digitize inside a public market, public contract.

09:39.012 --> 10:01.476
Well, it was a rather hard reason, but now, to answer your question, of course we have to deal with advice from department collections, correct, of course.

10:01.675 --> 10:25.741
And we are working with them to give priorities to, well, to know if the priority is to digitize travel or literature or about Paris or about Romantism or about dictionaries or, well, we have always this kind of question.

10:26.241 --> 10:30.906
And our purpose is to try

10:31.308 --> 10:49.671
to have a good coherence on this collection from an encyclopedic point of view, mostly on French culture.

10:50.495 --> 11:05.640
Of course, in science, philosophy, we have to go to other cultures, of course, but, for instance, in literature, we are only centered on French literature.

11:06.722 --> 11:12.992
When there is a strong influence from English or Spanish, we have also some

11:13.259 --> 11:23.530
Italian, but we have also this kind of books, but we are very centered on French culture.

11:23.550 --> 11:27.014
Now, these are not rare books, per se, are they?

11:27.034 --> 11:37.205
Well, some are very rare, but they are, let's say, difficult of access.

11:38.346 --> 11:39.267
For instance,

11:39.483 --> 12:07.414
for the collection on free access on the upper level of the library they are very different they are very it's mostly even it's mostly from a patrimonial historical point of view we have well and we have to take into account all problems of conservation

12:07.850 --> 12:29.163
And for instance, our colleagues, our curator colleagues, wants us to choose mostly, for instance, in 19th century brittle paper or acid paper, more than 18th century or 17th century where the paper is good.

12:29.183 --> 12:30.465
Same thing in the US.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.302
Yes, yes.

12:33.383 --> 12:42.093
We know the Cornell project about the history of mathematics in Cornell University.

12:44.455 --> 12:45.176
Cornell?

12:45.236 --> 12:45.897
Cornell, yes.

12:45.917 --> 12:59.692
They have digitized several hundred books because they are in a very bad stage in Britain, but they are from the 19th century.

13:00.052 --> 13:00.553
That's right.

13:00.736 --> 13:03.239
I've been to Cornell for this project.

13:03.539 --> 13:06.683
Cornell will be in this study.

13:06.903 --> 13:16.315
So therefore, you wouldn't expect to see anything by Voltaire or Mollier because there are many copies of these books.

13:16.335 --> 13:17.336
Yes, yes.

13:17.396 --> 13:23.824
We also want to give access to classical texts

13:24.108 --> 13:46.169
It's a very well-scientific published series, because you have a scientific comment or peri-text, because also it's a very scientific publishing and very well-commented.

13:46.690 --> 13:53.997
Well, even if these books are accessible now, first,

13:54.500 --> 13:59.207
This will not be any longer the case.

13:59.668 --> 14:15.130
And secondly, we think it's very important for a researcher, for a reader on his computer to have access also to references or very well done, published texts.

14:15.150 --> 14:16.793
Now, you mentioned Cornell.

14:17.374 --> 14:20.338
Now, when Cornell digitizes a book,

14:20.791 --> 14:22.740
They make a hard copy.

14:22.760 --> 14:24.629
They make a physical copy of the book.

14:24.689 --> 14:25.533
Do you do the same?

14:25.815 --> 14:26.176
Yes.

14:29.210 --> 14:29.552
Well...

14:30.173 --> 14:32.437
This is an experiment.

14:32.557 --> 14:36.363
This is an experiment in Richelieu.

14:37.084 --> 14:39.768
Perhaps Madame Sanson will show you that.

14:40.709 --> 14:46.058
I pushed from three years ago on this project.

14:46.639 --> 14:49.283
Well, now it's working.

14:49.683 --> 14:55.152
And it's from Digital and with Rang Xerox

14:55.402 --> 14:58.126
docu-tech, docu-print techniques.

14:59.588 --> 15:14.150
People digitized them inside from readers demand or from curators ask and they published this one for instance.

15:14.170 --> 15:16.313
It's about two or three francs a page

15:16.968 --> 15:29.644
Well, if you are American and you want to come back to U.S., you have only to order it inside the library and they will send it to you.

15:31.266 --> 15:40.518
We do that with external contractors to know if there is a public demand.

15:41.179 --> 15:43.482
Now, is there any indication here?

15:43.867 --> 15:48.012
Well, it wouldn't, but I'm not sure.

15:48.032 --> 15:54.541
The paperback jacket, but I'm wondering if they say... Well, no, they wouldn't.

15:58.987 --> 16:00.509
No, no.

16:00.529 --> 16:04.474
I'm sure when you bind it in the hard binding, they would probably say something

16:04.994 --> 16:07.738
That's probably the title page?

16:07.918 --> 16:09.881
This here would be the title page?

16:09.901 --> 16:10.823
Yes, I think so.

16:12.105 --> 16:16.952
But you can choose your size, you can choose everything.

16:17.352 --> 16:23.121
So do you think that you will do that with all 100,000, or that was just an experiment?

16:23.101 --> 16:50.205
No, it's just an experiment to know if there is a public demand to publish on demand, and also for internal use, because of course if you want to replace one book to be restored by another one, you can do it.

16:50.540 --> 16:58.507
The main purpose for us is to give access on a network.

17:00.288 --> 17:05.913
How do you say in English?

17:05.973 --> 17:11.958
The selection of books, documentary politics?

17:11.978 --> 17:14.621
Well, this is one of our missions.

17:14.981 --> 17:19.905
The second is to give the best access

17:20.442 --> 17:42.332
that bibliographic access to these digital materials, to these digital repositories, and this is a very acute, very hard, very complex question to deal with.

17:42.667 --> 17:53.439
And the third mission is to prepare a network cooperation with other libraries.

17:54.941 --> 18:07.915
For instance, in France, with other libraries who have specialized collections or old collections on their own, we could also digitize with them.

18:08.587 --> 18:21.924
And so that we will prepare remote access, distributed repositories, or distributed access.

18:21.984 --> 18:28.072
We don't want to digitize on our own alone.

18:28.472 --> 18:37.564
We want also to distribute this charge on all, well not all, but on several libraries.

18:37.865 --> 18:40.488
So this book is scanned.

18:40.768 --> 18:41.148
Yes.

18:41.168 --> 18:43.090
It's converted into zeros in one.

18:43.130 --> 18:43.550
Yes.

18:44.071 --> 18:46.513
It goes into a database, a computer base.

18:47.034 --> 18:58.545
If I, in the United States, want to read this, to see this book, conceivably, if I can get into the Bibliothic National catalog, I can get this.

18:58.705 --> 19:07.213
First, in all this material, all these 100,000 books already digitized,

19:07.193 --> 19:21.010
will be accessed next year for the opening of the research level, but only inside the library.

19:22.151 --> 19:35.648
Secondly, at the end of this year, in October, we will give access for an experimental part of this collection, it's about two

19:36.050 --> 19:47.745
1,500 books and periodicals about 19th century French century.

19:48.586 --> 20:02.563
Inside this selection we select books and periodicals about literature, history, political culture from the 19th century so that we could give remote access on internet

20:02.813 --> 20:24.286
not only to records, but also to table of contents in text version, in ASCII or text version, and all the text in bitmap in graphic mode, in acrobat format or something like that.

20:24.306 --> 20:26.289
So this is not ASCII, this is a true copy?

20:26.329 --> 20:28.833
Yes, this is a true copy.

20:28.853 --> 20:31.437
And we, well,

20:32.024 --> 20:51.221
Of course, the distinction between text version and image mode or graphic is a kind of dead end.

20:51.241 --> 21:01.069
But now we think there is a lot of solutions to give access to information by OCR

21:02.112 --> 21:26.770
even if this text from OCR wouldn't be given to the reader, you can keep this OCR incorrect text to search and retrieve information by search engine so that you can

21:26.952 --> 21:48.977
give the answer that i don't know the word lapicid if his word is well known in the 327 page but will it be certain it won't be searching from the true copy it'll be searching from from the ocr but he gave you the location

21:49.126 --> 21:51.248
Oh, that's one.

21:51.428 --> 21:59.757
And you know that you have only to download this page or this chapter to read about what process.

21:59.897 --> 22:01.339
You're putting the two together.

22:01.359 --> 22:06.585
You're putting the text only with the true copy, but you're making reference to the original book.

22:06.825 --> 22:13.632
And for us, it's rather very important to keep in the library

22:13.814 --> 22:16.759
approach and not a database.

22:16.779 --> 22:36.835
A library is not only text or content, it is also all the publishing form, of course, overall on all books, but not only the way the book was printed,

22:37.034 --> 22:39.980
was composed is very important, in fact.

22:40.521 --> 22:48.696
And it's not only logical structure, but it's physical structure, and it's very important to keep all this information for the reader.

22:50.199 --> 22:51.241
I applaud that.

22:51.261 --> 23:00.038
Yeah, because if you translate all that in an ASCII text, you will lose a lot of

23:00.406 --> 23:06.435
Well, all this, we say in French, typo dispositionnel.

23:06.495 --> 23:07.016
Nuance.

23:07.677 --> 23:08.718
Yes, yes.

23:08.738 --> 23:14.386
Yes, and the type of paper, the color of the print, the binding.

23:14.447 --> 23:24.321
And all, very often we have maps, we have etchings, we have tableaux, I don't know.

23:24.807 --> 23:38.099
In French, but also in Greek, you have also to keep this information.

23:38.119 --> 23:39.984
Is your background as a librarian?

23:40.485 --> 23:41.668
No, I was a teacher of

23:42.053 --> 23:43.495
Oh, really?

23:43.776 --> 23:44.797
Formally, yes.

23:45.178 --> 23:46.399
Well, that's very interesting.

23:46.920 --> 23:59.919
But I was always interested in new technologies, cultural new technologies, so that was the reason why I went to this project.

24:00.700 --> 24:10.795
Well, as a teacher of philosophy, and also as one who is involved in new technology, do you have some thoughts on the future of libraries?

24:11.467 --> 24:20.059
Yeah, it's a very exciting question, very exciting question, because...

24:20.697 --> 24:42.623
In USA you had very well, very good books, I don't know if you know it from the California Press, called The Future of the Books, from Gilles Meinberg, and I'm very close what not only him but other person says about the future of books.

24:43.424 --> 24:46.688
It's a very complex future, and

24:47.258 --> 25:15.375
My thought is it's not only a technical change, but it's also a change of thought because it's a change of support, a change of the way you are writing or presenting or composing something you want to communicate.

25:15.642 --> 25:26.420
The future of the library is also linked with this new way of writing, of communicating.

25:26.480 --> 25:34.714
It doesn't mean that books will disappear, not at all.

25:37.178 --> 25:41.565
But we will have another kind of level of

25:41.798 --> 25:51.526
of organizing our thinking, a way of communicating or learning something.

25:51.846 --> 25:58.432
Does it concern you and whether or not books of the future, I mean, clearly the books that we have will be preserved.

25:58.552 --> 25:58.732
Yeah.

25:58.752 --> 26:00.073
We're not going to lose them.

26:01.154 --> 26:06.579
It would be too expensive to digitize 10 million books and nobody could understand why you'd want to do that anyway.

26:07.199 --> 26:11.603
But books of the future, do you think there will come a time where they will be written and

26:12.123 --> 26:16.868
and transmitted entirely on computers and not ever see print?

26:19.210 --> 26:26.978
We don't know, but we already see that in research or science literature, a lot of things have changed.

26:27.219 --> 26:38.710
Periodicals come after you have already on the net the article given on the net.

26:39.311 --> 26:41.353
You have a lot of

26:41.637 --> 26:54.038
reading practice are changing because people are searching information more than reading a book from the beginning to the end.

26:54.679 --> 26:57.865
We think that there is a culture of hypertext.

26:57.885 --> 26:59.107
A cultural hypertext.

26:59.127 --> 27:07.341
Yes, it's very important to take into account the hypertext culture.

27:07.608 --> 27:34.611
My concern also as a philosopher is that I protect culture from Ted Nelson or things like that, Engelbart or Bush, all these American heroes, is converging with a lot of

27:35.300 --> 27:59.333
also French philosophers or writers, Barthes, Jeunette, Foucault, Derrida, have done about the problem of organizing writing, the way thinking is not linear,

28:00.477 --> 28:24.662
course but yes and you have a lot of echoes between this way of new literature let's say and the technical possibilities in hypertext and there is a lot of links well it's not it's no

28:24.878 --> 28:45.652
There is no determinism, of course, between one or them, but in parallel, we have, well, simply speaking, of course, you have a lot of echoes or relation between all these cultural on one hand and technical on the other hand possibilities.

28:46.734 --> 28:49.418
Do you think that people are

28:50.157 --> 28:52.760
too afraid of the future in some cases?

28:53.341 --> 28:56.505
Yes, I think mostly in France.

28:57.246 --> 28:58.568
People are very afraid.

29:00.070 --> 29:19.776
Always the question they ask you is the opposition between the screen and the book, the fear that it will

29:20.161 --> 29:24.205
damage the book culture?

29:25.006 --> 29:27.748
I don't think so, I don't think so at all.

29:28.529 --> 29:36.817
It's not the same use, it's not the same, for instance, for learning children.

29:36.837 --> 29:47.907
It will be, you will have better access to information with a computer on the net than with

29:47.887 --> 30:17.134
only class books on the program and of course they have to use books but also have access to database and links with teachers and there is no opposition Does it concern you though and some of the people we've talked to here today

30:18.042 --> 30:28.318
are concerned that perhaps the technology isn't really there to guarantee that this material, once it's put in zeros and ones and put in, that it will last.

30:28.438 --> 30:29.820
How long will it last?

30:29.840 --> 30:31.002
Is this a concern?

30:31.062 --> 30:32.304
This is a question.

30:32.404 --> 30:34.868
And how do you maintain an archival document?

30:36.490 --> 30:37.852
Yes, this is a question.

30:38.013 --> 30:39.595
It's a question of

30:39.828 --> 30:52.225
of the soft in which you have encoded the text, but mostly of the system, operating system, the evolution of the operating system and the machines.

30:52.245 --> 31:05.143
And we know there is a problem of recopying all these digital materials, let's say, every 10 years or something like that.

31:05.495 --> 31:08.519
There's a big concern on that.

31:08.860 --> 31:13.126
But everything isn't eternal.

31:13.146 --> 31:14.108
Of course.

31:15.710 --> 31:27.687
Photographies and also electromagnetic supports, even the optical supports are not everlasting supports.

31:28.609 --> 31:31.553
But even if you know that you have to

31:32.242 --> 31:41.351
migrated is the word they use, to another system every 10 years, somebody has to make sure that everything is copied into the new system.

31:41.992 --> 31:43.954
What if somebody forgets to do this book?

31:44.474 --> 31:46.316
Is a loss there?

31:47.497 --> 31:53.223
I think there is a new question of relation with memory.

31:54.304 --> 32:01.371
Because with digital materials, it's like

32:01.587 --> 32:23.410
It looks like everything could be remembered when you want, which is not the same on books, because you have well-known books, very unknown or very rare books or very precious ones.

32:23.660 --> 32:27.990
In digital collection, nothing is precious.

32:29.374 --> 32:30.557
It's at the same level.

32:31.218 --> 32:41.162
It's only for intellectual reasons that you can underline that or outline that this is very important.

32:41.412 --> 33:09.597
on this well but not for normal material or aesthetical or rare reason we have to recreate all this cultural context about digital culture so as we could give perspective and a memory approach on that if everything is written on these machines

33:09.813 --> 33:13.060
Does that mean the end of things, rare and precious, do you think?

33:14.142 --> 33:16.967
Well, it could be the danger.

33:16.987 --> 33:18.029
I don't think so.

33:19.553 --> 33:30.775
But you have to recreate the cultural environment, the links between, for instance, scholarship, publishing.

33:31.801 --> 33:34.625
Very, very simply.

33:35.145 --> 33:43.597
In France, if a book is printed by Gallimard, well, even if you don't open the book, you know this is surely a good book.

33:44.057 --> 33:48.123
Well, it's perhaps an error, but Gallimard is a good publisher.

33:48.203 --> 33:48.684
It's sufficient.

33:49.344 --> 33:56.274
The color, yeah, the color of the cover and the use are only NRF.

33:56.794 --> 33:58.737
Well, it's...

33:59.155 --> 34:07.746
It's a signal that there is a lot of value, perhaps no value, but generally speaking.

34:07.806 --> 34:26.310
On my opinion, you have not yet this kind of context or cultural environment.

34:26.662 --> 34:38.795
And we have to take some recul, some, well, it's true news, in fact.

34:40.316 --> 34:49.186
Something that concerns both my wife and myself is that when you write something and when it's printed, there's a true copy, there's an original copy.

34:50.547 --> 34:55.032
When something is written on a computer, and available only on a computer,

34:55.703 --> 34:57.206
It can be changed, Kenneth.

34:57.226 --> 34:58.589
There's no primary source.

34:58.609 --> 35:05.885
You really can't see how texts change over the years if you're constantly modifying it, correcting it.

35:06.807 --> 35:09.733
And there's also the danger that somebody else can go in.

35:09.793 --> 35:14.303
That's the reason why I think the...

35:14.620 --> 35:35.969
Let's say the old problem, everlasting problem of integrity, authority, publishing, Marx, are on a new level still alive question.

35:37.992 --> 35:42.458
Well, you can have a text from Nietzsche on the internet.

35:42.478 --> 35:43.800
Is it really from Nietzsche?

35:44.000 --> 36:02.599
and you have to know who had put this text on what side and with which agreement or referee or committee and you have all that environment to

36:02.933 --> 36:09.704
to give value of this authenticity of this text.

36:09.824 --> 36:28.654
It's a new problem, an old problem, a new way to... It's a greater problem, because if you call up a text and it purports itself to be... But on paper... If somebody has very subtly gone in and altered a date, altered a name, you know, these are the things we've talked about.

36:29.478 --> 36:38.514
On paper also you have this kind of piracy or whatever.

36:39.555 --> 36:47.749
Well, at a less extent, of course, because it's easier to find.

36:49.172 --> 36:53.359
But, for instance, in the 19th century you had

36:54.031 --> 37:07.470
publishing done in Belgium, who looks like French publishing, but who are not the same, and the text is not the same, and we don't really know who would do it.

37:07.530 --> 37:13.639
Did you have any questions?

37:13.659 --> 37:16.362
Yeah, that was outstanding.

37:16.382 --> 37:16.983
I'm sorry, go ahead.

37:17.544 --> 37:23.953
No, well, our work is so first select all these materials,

37:24.220 --> 37:31.231
And we are very happy to end this first level of 100,000 books.

37:36.899 --> 37:46.273
We have a lot of new questions, of course, being, for instance, the links between text and images, which is very important.

37:48.316 --> 37:50.700
All the materials, for instance,

37:51.018 --> 37:53.341
music cover.

37:53.361 --> 37:53.842
That's right.

37:54.463 --> 37:57.947
Now, for some of these 100,000, are some of these illustrated books?

37:58.348 --> 37:58.648
Sorry?

37:58.808 --> 38:01.031
Are some of these books illustrated books?

38:01.152 --> 38:01.532
Yes.

38:01.552 --> 38:04.296
With wet engravings or cover plate engravings?

38:04.616 --> 38:20.738
And so then you have to have a higher... For instance, we had digitized from the Smithsonian Institute publication from the 19th century about America, Indians, and you have a lot of

38:21.292 --> 38:32.062
images of all kinds, photographies, etchings, drawings in black and white colors.

38:32.122 --> 38:39.909
Each illustration is very important to the text.

38:39.929 --> 38:51.180
So we want to have not only in black and white bitmap digitization, but also have a new

38:51.481 --> 39:02.519
digitization of all this illustration in the best way, in more defined colors, for instance.

39:02.539 --> 39:04.542
DPI is the best, 600 DPI.

39:04.682 --> 39:08.669
And with a link between text and images.

39:08.809 --> 39:18.805
And you have almost to rebuild, to republish, to restructure all that, which is a very, very easy work.

39:19.055 --> 39:22.178
I think you indicated the price of about three francs per page.

39:22.198 --> 39:25.842
Is that about what it's costing you right now?

39:25.862 --> 39:41.419
Well, the amount of budget, officially, only to digitize and to buy books or microphones, it's 100.

39:41.439 --> 39:45.784
It's rather easy to retain, to remember.

39:45.844 --> 39:47.205
It's 100.

39:47.506 --> 40:13.311
uh million francs one million francs we have not spent all this amount of money about 80 million francs for 100 000 books and i think you have about 80 000 done now is that right sorry you have about 80 000 done now have you done it 90 000 yeah yes

40:13.713 --> 40:15.175
She does it rather quickly then.

40:15.236 --> 40:15.716
Yes.

40:15.736 --> 40:18.160
We have already 90,000 books.

40:19.282 --> 40:37.833
It's about 28 million of pages on digital audio tapes, recording support, and all that is already transferred on optical discs.

40:37.854 --> 40:39.196
I see.

40:39.216 --> 40:39.957
Did you have a question?

40:41.253 --> 40:44.297
Does this project have a name, this 100,000 books?

40:44.397 --> 40:46.119
Is there a name for this book?

40:46.139 --> 40:52.187
No, it's a digitizing project of Bibliothèque Nationale de France.

40:52.207 --> 40:55.110
It's not like the year 2000 project?

40:55.251 --> 41:05.944
No, but it would be a good idea because all of this will be really in excess.

41:05.924 --> 41:31.982
In 2000, it would be a very good goal to give remote access all over the world to this material, because it could be very important to other countries, for instance, for the South countries, to have only with the computer on the line, the phone line, to have access via Internet.

41:32.333 --> 41:34.617
So this is short term, 100,000 books.

41:34.777 --> 41:38.002
When those 100,000 are done, another 100,000?

41:38.944 --> 41:56.953
Formerly, it was 300,000 targets, because we thought it was the size of an encyclopedic collection, about 300,000, let's say.

41:57.113 --> 41:58.155
When you select

41:58.321 --> 42:01.026
both on the first level.

42:01.547 --> 42:14.209
But for economic reasons, for budget reasons, of course, we had only the right to attain, to go to 100%.

42:15.591 --> 42:21.662
And we wanted to achieve this.

42:22.148 --> 42:23.049
this goal.

42:23.069 --> 42:29.458
And you probably said it, but just to make sure I have it on the tape, how many years has this program taken?

42:29.878 --> 42:34.885
Between 1991 and mostly 1992 to until now.

42:35.906 --> 42:37.729
Five years.

42:37.789 --> 42:38.950
And it will be done this year?

42:39.011 --> 42:39.651
Yes.

42:41.113 --> 42:50.586
We ended at the end of the year and we will have this experimental access of this 19th

42:50.937 --> 43:09.722
century collection and we expect a lot of from this experiment because we want people to give us critics or suggestions we already have a discussion group on internet about the presentation

43:09.702 --> 43:23.164
On this server we have five pages describing the 19th century collection from a historical and thematical point of view.

43:23.785 --> 43:34.343
And a lot of researchers, or not a lot, but some researchers and scholars gave us advice or critics on what we are...

43:34.323 --> 43:46.435
So if I call up BNF on the internet, I can... Well, it will be on the BNF server next week or in a couple of weeks.

43:46.455 --> 43:49.678
But right now, you don't have to know that.

43:49.758 --> 43:52.341
It's a bit of a scandal.

43:52.661 --> 44:01.630
It's on Liverpool, on UCAR, because it is an academic...

44:01.610 --> 44:11.479
a server of French culture called Disneuf.

44:11.499 --> 44:14.401
The site is called Disneuf.

44:15.222 --> 44:19.566
I'll give you the address.

44:19.586 --> 44:30.435
They want us to give them some indication so we only give them five pages of what we are doing.

44:30.652 --> 44:31.853
But that's good, it's there.

44:31.873 --> 44:36.117
Well, inside it was not very well appreciated.

44:36.137 --> 44:36.718
Inside here.

44:37.038 --> 44:37.719
Yeah.

44:38.159 --> 44:41.863
Do you have any thoughts, and I know you're a busy man, I don't want to take up too much of your time.

44:41.903 --> 44:43.685
No, it's all right.

44:43.705 --> 44:46.908
A library is built, some libraries last for hundreds of years.

44:47.369 --> 44:48.850
Yeah, I hope so.

44:48.890 --> 44:56.898
But architects of today, I was talking to a gentleman in the United States, and he said, you know, you have to decide what is the life of a library.

44:57.198 --> 44:59.781
Some people think just 50 years, which is, you know,

45:00.503 --> 45:05.097
What do you think the life of this library is in terms of

45:05.482 --> 45:12.849
Well, almost off record, but on record, almost off record.

45:13.209 --> 45:20.336
I could tell you, perhaps because when I was young I wanted to be an architect.

45:22.578 --> 45:25.221
But, no, it's a kind of joke.

45:25.781 --> 45:33.008
I think this is a very important question because, of course, if you only want to store,

45:32.988 --> 45:43.518
to classical, traditional supports, paper, images, even videotapes.

45:43.958 --> 45:53.387
Of course you have to do repositories, stories, reading rooms and all that.

45:54.789 --> 46:01.375
Well, the 19th architecture is the climax of the architecture of the library.

46:01.979 --> 46:20.292
But if you think about what is access to information, text, images from the digital point of view, you have perhaps other opportunity to organize.

46:20.677 --> 46:37.161
the space, the time, the functionalities, the way people have to meet them or to meet librarians or to meet original support or only.

46:37.501 --> 46:38.022
I don't know.

46:38.182 --> 46:47.055
And if you have this idea in mind, perhaps you will do something completely different from this building.

46:47.710 --> 47:02.368
I don't know, but because you can store things very far from where you are to access, a kind of network architecture or logical architecture, rather different.

47:03.209 --> 47:09.237
Well, a national library will be always a national library.

47:09.377 --> 47:13.262
It will be a monument, of course.

47:13.664 --> 47:17.869
So therefore, this library makes a statement physically.

47:18.089 --> 47:22.454
Not only by its function it makes a statement.

47:22.474 --> 47:23.155
Is that a fair statement?

47:23.175 --> 47:23.515
Yes.

47:24.036 --> 47:27.460
And the statement is, in your view, what is the statement?

47:30.503 --> 47:31.705
We use the word patrimony.

47:31.765 --> 47:33.046
I've heard that word a lot.

47:33.627 --> 47:35.169
The word patrimony.

47:35.189 --> 47:35.369
Yeah.

47:35.529 --> 47:40.515
And we're talking about what we see when we look at the Bibliotheque Nationale.

47:40.765 --> 47:43.988
as a symbol of the French nation and culture.

47:44.189 --> 47:46.211
Is that a fair...?

47:46.251 --> 47:55.341
When the people of France and from around the world look at these four towers and this building, what do you expect them to think and to feel?

47:55.361 --> 48:10.637
The architect, Mr. Perrault, wanted both the monumental side for the patrimony signification, but also the transparency.

48:11.022 --> 48:33.570
the un-monumental, so that he wants to show that it was the library of not only for Paris, for Persians, but for all the country or for

48:33.955 --> 48:48.812
Well, digital access was already inside the, what do you say in English, the command, the presidential command from the former president Mitterrand.

48:50.474 --> 48:57.782
The most important thing was to give access with a new technology of information communication.

48:57.802 --> 49:03.068
So in 1980 and 1980,

49:03.875 --> 49:06.577
1988, yes.

49:10.381 --> 49:24.073
But he combined these two ideas, transparency and monumental, but of course it's more monumental than other things, I think so.

49:24.093 --> 49:31.840
You said in your almost off-the-record statement about how you would like to have been an architect, you thought about being an architect at some point,

49:32.562 --> 49:36.387
when you think of the monumental nature of the structure, you probably shouldn't have had glass.

49:37.128 --> 49:42.234
If you're thinking just of a functional library, you probably wouldn't have built it with all these glass windows.

49:43.115 --> 49:51.466
But to achieve that transparency that you're talking about, I guess the glass was necessary.

49:51.486 --> 49:54.129
It became, as you know, a problem.

49:54.269 --> 49:59.255
Indeed, yeah.

49:59.275 --> 50:02.299
We are very...

50:03.376 --> 50:25.399
It's one of our work and we are very interested in all the digital library project in USA, the national digital project initiatives and we thought that a lot of things were done here.

50:25.459 --> 50:31.105
For instance, we have also

50:32.350 --> 50:38.581
think over the problem of workstation interface.

50:40.103 --> 50:44.751
It was a very high-tech solution in 1992.

50:45.212 --> 50:57.733
Well, now it's completely banalized, completely common.

50:58.051 --> 51:03.119
because of Internet access, because of Java solution, because a lot of things.

51:03.540 --> 51:15.519
But for us, it's a very important thing to know what people can do in reading activities on their own machine.

51:18.103 --> 51:20.447
It's not only to view text.

51:20.680 --> 51:32.399
but it's also to compute this text, to compute information, to annotate, to write, to put in database.

51:33.681 --> 51:47.143
If you digitize books, it's not only to give a larger access, but it's also to give a deeper way of working, a more productive way of working.

51:47.697 --> 51:56.405
And we had done an experimental test bed in 1992.

51:57.706 --> 52:17.164
I'll tell you that because you will find information about that in this text, about what we call the computer-assisted reading environment, PLAO, post-lecture assistée par ordinateur, in English, computer-assisted reading environment, PLAO.

52:17.684 --> 52:46.510
and care in english and well it was very how do you say avant-garde avant-garde in 1992 i remember american librarian researcher from california went in 1992 and 1993 and was very

52:46.895 --> 52:57.951
interesting, exciting on this side, because the end user could be assisted in all his research or reading activity.

52:58.631 --> 53:16.817
For instance, when you are reading a book, of course, you underline something, you put notes, annotations, and all this scholar reading, active, dynamic reading, could be assisted on your registration.

53:17.287 --> 53:46.129
you have a great deal of open question of what you can do on record repositories, on what you call, what we can call your own personal library, what you do when you gather a lot of materials from everywhere and you keep it in your own personal library, and what you are doing on your desk.

53:46.565 --> 53:48.487
when you are writing or reading.

53:48.907 --> 54:01.219
And all this free level has to be, for us, a virtual library is the new significance, new signification of this free level.

54:01.599 --> 54:02.740
You discussed that in one of these?

54:02.780 --> 54:03.081
Yeah.

54:03.101 --> 54:04.242
Because it's very interesting.

54:04.262 --> 54:05.523
This impacts on reading.

54:07.485 --> 54:14.952
You know, when you talk about one thing you will lose when a scholar reads a book and does his

54:15.117 --> 54:18.742
or her own annotations, the marginalia, that's going to disappear.

54:19.303 --> 54:32.902
But what you're telling me now is that you can customize the reading on the computer to fit the individual scholar and to preserve that reader's observation.

54:33.102 --> 54:34.144
People agree.

54:34.184 --> 54:40.753
For instance, you have Lévi-Strauss or something, who will work.

54:41.054 --> 54:53.312
on the library, we could perhaps ask him to keep, to preserve the manuscript, the annotation, the marginalia he has done.

54:54.314 --> 54:56.617
Perhaps he won, perhaps he doesn't want.

54:56.637 --> 54:59.161
Well, congratulations to the French for thinking of this.

54:59.241 --> 55:00.603
This is really very important.

55:00.643 --> 55:00.963
Yes.

55:01.344 --> 55:08.935
Because something that concerns so many people is that we are losing documentation of the reading experience.

55:09.505 --> 55:14.390
if it's done strictly here, what is the reaction of the person?

55:14.430 --> 55:18.294
And so often, it happens here on the margins of books.

55:18.674 --> 55:24.980
We try to be very close to the traditional model.

55:26.682 --> 55:32.127
For instance, for us, reading is a very complex activity, of course.

55:32.788 --> 55:36.571
And it's not only search and retrieve information.

55:36.972 --> 55:39.394
We think libraries,

55:39.492 --> 55:50.547
The first goal is a reading place, to help people, of course, to gather good information, but afterwards what they are doing is reading.

55:51.168 --> 56:06.208
And you have to give tools on the environment so that the reading activity is not only preserved, but with the best

56:06.543 --> 56:10.607
best productivity, better productivity.

56:10.627 --> 56:12.329
Who do you suppose proposed this?

56:12.529 --> 56:13.190
The scholars?

56:13.330 --> 56:14.171
The philosophers?

56:14.831 --> 56:16.733
Who proposed helping?

56:16.753 --> 56:32.989
Well, it was from, it's a good question, it was from writers, philosophers, historians, it was about 10 or 12 persons, and we asked them

56:33.678 --> 56:43.755
what kind of tools they would need if they had the good computer.

56:44.777 --> 56:59.702
It was in 1989 and we lend them, we give them a Macintosh with the best stage of the art in software.

56:59.834 --> 57:23.125
and, well, they give advice or critics in their own works, for instance you have Roubault, a French writer Roubault, from Oedipo, from a novelist, and he is

57:23.341 --> 57:34.949
working on his own already on computers, but he wanted things very different to give hypertext access, for instance.

57:34.969 --> 57:39.460
And afterwards, we gathered all this advice

57:39.946 --> 57:58.125
and we give them for a call of tender, so that computer private company competes.

57:59.006 --> 58:08.215
And one of them gave back an application on

58:08.515 --> 58:32.948
under UNIX and system, and where you can visualize both text and images, annotate, links, underline, structure, and, well, it was done in 1992, and this is this... So there was a model for this stuff?

58:33.208 --> 58:33.629
Yeah.

58:33.649 --> 58:35.732
And is it in place, or is it still experimental?

58:36.452 --> 58:37.594
Well...

58:38.367 --> 58:52.478
We hope it will finally realize for next year in a more simple way because it was done in our solution.

58:52.947 --> 59:07.986
from a computer approach, and the computer engineers here doesn't want to have an in-house solution, but only common solution from Microsoft.

59:08.006 --> 59:21.823
And we will use common tools, but by chance, from 1992 until now, all the progress done

59:22.478 --> 59:25.063
had confirmed this approach.

59:25.664 --> 59:44.841
Now you have a lot of tools to annotate, to links, to have in the same format text, images, for instance Acrobat from Adobe, to put OCR solution backwards, to have both.

59:45.158 --> 59:51.585
Well, all these tools are not completely integrated, but they will be.

59:52.045 --> 01:00:01.836
And the only things we do is to integrate commercial solutions in computers.

01:00:01.856 --> 01:00:06.501
What was the name of the French writer again who gave the proposal?

01:00:06.641 --> 01:00:08.423
It began with H, I think.

01:00:11.366 --> 01:00:12.988
I will give you that.

01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:35.854
One is the French novelist Jacques Roubault, R-O-U-B-A-U-D, Roubault.

01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:39.604
Jacques.

01:00:40.205 --> 01:00:55.446
Another is the philosopher Bernard Stiegler.
