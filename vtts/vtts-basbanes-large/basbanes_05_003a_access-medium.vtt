WEBVTT

00:02.984 --> 00:09.890
Dyson, and you're going out to Bethlehem, PA next week to give a talk.

00:09.910 --> 00:17.117
And I guess the title of the talk is the same of this most recent book of yours.

00:18.338 --> 00:18.518
Right.

00:18.558 --> 00:19.479
Well, you're right.

00:19.559 --> 00:21.541
Race Rules, Navigating the Color Line.

00:21.561 --> 00:22.101
Oh, that's not.

00:22.141 --> 00:22.742
Okay.

00:22.902 --> 00:26.665
No, I thought the title was Between God and Gangster Rap.

00:26.946 --> 00:31.810
Well, I had that book come out earlier this year, and I got another book coming out in a couple weeks.

00:31.790 --> 00:34.703
Give me the full title and the publisher.

00:34.724 --> 00:38.762
Yeah, it's called Race Rules, subtitled Navigating the Color Line.

00:38.928 --> 00:39.669
Yeah.

00:39.689 --> 00:41.592
And it's being published by Addison Wesley.

00:42.092 --> 00:42.493
Okay.

00:42.653 --> 00:43.854
Well, who's your publicist there?

00:44.716 --> 00:46.358
A woman named Debbie Youse.

00:46.378 --> 00:47.099
Okay.

00:47.199 --> 00:49.662
So maybe we can do a triple whammy here.

00:50.303 --> 00:50.623
Oh, yeah.

00:50.804 --> 00:55.510
Her number is 212-463-8591.

00:55.750 --> 00:56.451
Okay.

00:56.471 --> 01:00.256
So now maybe we can get into my little syndicate of 25 newspapers.

01:00.296 --> 01:00.757
Right.

01:01.197 --> 01:05.543
Because I do a weekly piece on an author.

01:05.523 --> 01:12.314
And I'm in largely university towns, which is perfect for us, you know, for you.

01:12.334 --> 01:13.896
I'm in Charlottesville, Virginia.

01:14.077 --> 01:15.599
I'm in Eugene, Oregon.

01:15.960 --> 01:17.482
I'm in Jackson, Mississippi.

01:17.823 --> 01:19.085
I'm in Gainesville, Florida.

01:19.105 --> 01:20.507
I'm in four New England papers.

01:21.569 --> 01:24.153
I'm in Columbus, Austin, Salt Lake City.

01:24.974 --> 01:26.877
So that's a diverse readership.

01:27.178 --> 01:31.705
And what brings it all together is that I write about pertinent things and literary things.

01:31.905 --> 01:32.526
Wonderful.

01:32.506 --> 01:38.580
So if you get this new book coming from Addison Wesley, then you and I can do some business here.

01:38.600 --> 01:38.900
That's right.

01:38.921 --> 01:39.341
That's right.

01:39.402 --> 01:40.284
That's what I'm saying.

01:40.344 --> 01:47.159
See, when I talk to you again, then we'll talk about, you know, you'll have a chance to check that book up, and then we'll talk for an hour, two hours.

01:47.380 --> 01:48.422
When's that publishing?

01:48.402 --> 01:49.364
October 23rd.

01:49.404 --> 01:50.646
Oh, that's great.

01:50.926 --> 01:51.126
Yeah.

01:51.267 --> 01:51.547
Cool.

01:51.767 --> 01:52.028
All right.

01:52.048 --> 01:54.071
So let's not even talk about that because I haven't had a chance to.

01:54.131 --> 01:57.076
Is that the title then of this talk that you're doing?

01:57.136 --> 01:57.677
I guess so, man.

01:57.717 --> 02:00.241
You know, my wife has smoked these things up, so I have no idea.

02:00.321 --> 02:02.504
But I think that must be that.

02:02.645 --> 02:08.093
Well, why don't you give me an idea of how this new book builds on your previous work?

02:08.153 --> 02:09.816
How's that for a nice opening question?

02:09.836 --> 02:15.625
Well, I extend through this new book some of the themes I've been preoccupied with before.

02:16.212 --> 02:18.535
but I try to bring them to an even broader audience.

02:18.996 --> 02:26.126
And I deal with crises in contemporary black culture and cultural expression.

02:26.206 --> 02:34.637
So I'm looking at black institutions, black major events in black life and relationships in black culture.

02:34.697 --> 02:38.403
The events that I examine are things like the O.J.

02:38.423 --> 02:42.388
Simpson trial and the consequences of that trial.

02:42.976 --> 02:55.434
And I look at the Million Man March through the lens of the leadership styles and aspirations of Colin Powell and Minister Louis Farrakhan.

02:55.454 --> 03:00.301
And then I also look at institutions of black life like the black church.

03:00.381 --> 03:09.895
I have a long chapter on the black church and sex where I try to talk about the understanding of embodiment within African American religious circles and the degree to which that

03:10.381 --> 03:18.349
sense of embodiment has been reflected in secular culture and also constrained some of it, or been contrasted to some of its expressions.

03:18.369 --> 03:37.688
And I have a long chapter on hip-hop culture, but really it uses hip-hop culture to examine the kind of intergenerational debates among African Americans, and especially the culture of nostalgia, as I say, the pockets of nostalgia, the hearkening back to a golden age of black life that

03:38.022 --> 03:44.812
I think never existed, but it's certainly used rhetorically to try to trump some of the most recent expressions of black culture.

03:45.833 --> 03:52.883
When you go out like this, as you are, I certainly have to localize it to Bethlehem, PA, where I've never been.

03:52.963 --> 03:53.584
Right, right.

03:53.604 --> 03:57.309
But when you go out like this, do you have any sense of who your audience is going to be?

03:57.930 --> 04:04.920
Yeah, well, you know, I always get a kind of lowdown on, you know, they'll give me, I ask them to fax me about a week before so it should be coming early.

04:05.060 --> 04:05.160
Yeah.

04:05.562 --> 04:15.313
of, you know, what kind of problems and issues that people are dealing with, what kind of situation they're in, what are some of the issues that they want to see addressed, and how I can best fit in.

04:15.333 --> 04:21.139
So yeah, I try to get a sense of some of the local color, as it were, to give texture to my own speech.

04:21.259 --> 04:27.546
But in the larger sense, is there a general message, or is there a message that you're trying to convey?

04:27.866 --> 04:34.033
Yeah, well, I'm trying to talk about the complexity of race and the difficulty of speaking across racial boundaries.

04:34.520 --> 04:36.883
but the necessity for doing so.

04:37.283 --> 04:48.137
And so my project is about trying to forge connections between, you know, not only black and white, but among African Americans of different classes, different castes, if you will.

04:48.958 --> 04:59.250
And so that message is that, you know, we've got to deal with the history of race and the facts of race so that we can get an appreciation for what the historic problems have been.

04:59.270 --> 05:00.932
And then we've got to move beyond that

05:01.300 --> 05:08.205
to forging the future of race and figuring out how we can constitute a better, healthier, more insightful

05:08.557 --> 05:15.651
community, whether locally or nationally, to try to figure out how to get beyond this bitter racial impasse that I think we're presently bogged down in.

05:16.011 --> 05:26.091
In one of the reviews between God and Gangsta Rap, one of the reviewers suggested that you preach a canon of inclusion.

05:26.512 --> 05:27.594
Is that true, number one?

05:27.614 --> 05:31.341
And if it is, perhaps you could explain or define that for me.

05:31.321 --> 05:54.486
Yeah, well, if what is meant by candidate of inclusion is that I'm trying to talk about a wide variety of peoples and perspectives and ideas that are allowed to constitute what it means to be black or how we reflect upon those texts and ideas and books that are important, musics and so on, then that's absolutely right because I'm about trying to figure out a way of doing that.

05:54.567 --> 05:57.750
And then secondly, if inclusion is meant I want to strategize for

05:58.220 --> 06:08.365
intervening in these larger mainstream societies and having black folk and other minorities participate, that's absolutely true as well.

06:08.767 --> 06:18.121
You know, beyond that, then, what I'm trying to do is to talk about how the canon, the books of... Oh, boy.

06:18.161 --> 06:20.845
You're really getting into my ballpark now.

06:20.865 --> 06:21.265
Yeah, yeah, right.

06:21.285 --> 06:22.307
I should defer, right?

06:22.327 --> 06:22.547
Yeah.

06:22.567 --> 06:28.816
But, you know, given these recent canon debates, and as I, in between God and Gangstrap, I have that chapter on Shakespeare and Smokey Robin.

06:28.836 --> 06:29.117
Right.

06:29.958 --> 06:33.223
Where I try to talk about, you know, it's about both and, not either or.

06:33.643 --> 06:34.825
We don't have to trash...

06:35.362 --> 06:49.745
you know, Eurocentric or European tradition, even though we can examine its weaknesses and its flaws and its limitations of vision, but we can also embrace certain elements of that tradition because it's been remade through the lens of an American and especially African-American culture.

06:49.805 --> 06:51.688
So you're a moderate in this regard, probably.

06:52.529 --> 06:59.901
Well, I would think that I'm a person who is radically investigating those specific forms of black culture, but

06:59.881 --> 07:08.492
I'm not an Afro-centrist, and I wouldn't give Afro-centrism as the radical edge unless it certainly might be an extreme perspective.

07:08.512 --> 07:10.134
You would not say that's the radical edge?

07:10.695 --> 07:11.976
That is not the radical edge?

07:12.117 --> 07:12.277
No.

07:12.317 --> 07:15.561
Well, it's an extreme edge, I would think, but I don't think radical.

07:15.581 --> 07:19.045
See, radical, I reserve the difference, say, between Martin Luther King Jr.

07:19.085 --> 07:24.252
and Malcolm X. Well, Malcolm certainly at a certain level might have been more militant, but I think King was more radical.

07:24.637 --> 07:33.890
So he's radical in the sense he's going to the roots of society, trying to figure out how we can redistribute resources that make the largest impact upon black people.

07:34.050 --> 07:34.872
So that's radical to me.

07:34.892 --> 07:52.737
So when I think of radical, I think it's much more radical to challenge the domination of interpretation of these books by white authors, to challenge how those interpretations have gone out, and to challenge how people have read Shakespeare, how people have read Melville, how people have read Thoreau.

07:52.936 --> 07:58.942
how people have read Emerson and see that through the perspective and lens of different cultures.

07:58.962 --> 08:06.009
I think that's much more radical than saying, let's have a purely Afrocentric perspective that says, let's ground and root the world.

08:06.549 --> 08:11.214
And why even bother with Shakespeare and Thoreau and Emerson?

08:11.234 --> 08:16.739
I mean, I've heard that you can get a degree at Georgetown University now in English literature.

08:16.759 --> 08:18.060
I mean, I read this in the New York Times.

08:18.100 --> 08:20.783
Without being required

08:21.337 --> 08:24.761
to study Shakespeare or Milton or Schotzer or Spencer.

08:24.981 --> 08:38.236
And I wonder how good a degree, I mean, maybe get a degree in literature, but to call it English literature, and not to read these four white, dead, white European males, to me is ridiculous, truthfully.

08:38.276 --> 08:47.547
And it's also equally ridiculous to be ignorant of Du Bois, and of Hurston, and of Morrison, and of, you know, and Baldwin, and Ellen.

08:47.527 --> 08:48.951
Well, go ahead.

08:48.991 --> 08:52.360
I did the first interview in the country last year with Dorothy West.

08:52.741 --> 08:59.138
I went out to Martha's Vineyard, and I got that piece in 40 papers, including the Philadelphia Inquirer.

08:59.158 --> 09:01.745
You've got to send me a copy.

09:01.785 --> 09:02.768
It's the best piece.

09:02.748 --> 09:06.595
In fact, my friend Charles called me the day it ran in the Philadelphia Inquiry.

09:06.615 --> 09:12.407
He said, Nick, I posted this in the Sullivan Hall here on campus at Temple.

09:13.008 --> 09:14.711
She is, to me, she's a goddess.

09:16.394 --> 09:19.440
So the thing, as you know then, the thing is that

09:19.420 --> 09:27.474
You know, it's a broad and wide tradition, as Lawrence Levine has proved in his latest book, that what it was meant by the canon was an invention after the World War.

09:27.554 --> 09:29.258
Oh, that's the brand new book from Beacon, right?

09:29.278 --> 09:29.698
That's right.

09:29.718 --> 09:30.380
I just got it.

09:30.580 --> 09:31.141
Yeah.

09:31.161 --> 09:32.163
I just got it.

09:32.263 --> 09:37.412
So let's not pontificate about the canon when the canon is something of recent invention.

09:37.645 --> 09:40.430
You think so, a recent invention?

09:40.470 --> 09:45.538
Well, a recent invention in the sense of what books are constituted in that canon, not the notion of a canon.

09:45.558 --> 09:48.042
Yeah, you see, this is going to be a great chapter in my new book.

09:48.142 --> 09:50.226
I'm just entering this debate here.

09:50.246 --> 09:51.147
Oh, yeah, right.

09:51.227 --> 09:55.995
And I already spent three hours with Harold Bloom down in New Haven two or three weeks ago.

09:56.696 --> 09:58.920
And, you know, he's there.

09:58.980 --> 10:00.683
He does represent...

10:01.051 --> 10:03.715
Oh, no question, no question.

10:03.755 --> 10:07.900
Well, see, when we talk again, we won't be able to do it today, but when we talk again, we're going to have a heck of a time.

10:07.920 --> 10:09.883
I may even have to come down and see you.

10:10.083 --> 10:10.784
Well, that would be great.

10:10.884 --> 10:11.365
Let's do that.

10:11.385 --> 10:14.469
Because I also want you to recommend to me other people.

10:14.910 --> 10:15.210
Sure.

10:15.991 --> 10:19.816
I know Gates here at Harvard is an obvious... Right, right, right.

10:19.836 --> 10:21.418
But other people, yeah, I'll definitely do that.

10:21.458 --> 10:22.320
Yeah, you should come on down.

10:22.340 --> 10:24.863
We'll spend a day like this guy is doing in about 15 minutes.

10:24.883 --> 10:28.388
Okay, well, so let's... He's coming from Kansas, and he's going to be here for all day.

10:28.548 --> 10:30.771
Okay, well, so let's...

10:30.751 --> 10:34.337
Let's get a couple of sound bites here for this piece.

10:34.357 --> 10:35.344
Right, right.

10:35.763 --> 10:37.165
Such as it is.

10:37.185 --> 10:51.388
So what I'll jump to then is, this is easy here, we go to the final paragraph of the preface and you say, as I write albums by hardcore rapper Tupac Shakur and Black Pop, Legend of Stevie Wonder, etc.

10:52.449 --> 10:55.594
So let's just bring this up to date with the Shakur.

10:55.875 --> 10:56.616
Yeah, yeah.

10:56.876 --> 10:58.379
Maybe you can give me a comment on that.

10:58.399 --> 10:58.779
I'll do that.

10:58.799 --> 11:02.445
Well, I wrote a piece about three or four weeks ago for the LA Times on Tupac.

11:02.425 --> 11:05.954
that you might want to eat if you got online or something like that.

11:06.195 --> 11:06.897
I do.

11:06.917 --> 11:09.043
You think I'll just go L.A.

11:09.063 --> 11:09.323
Times?

11:09.384 --> 11:10.105
It should be there, right?

11:10.126 --> 11:16.061
Yeah, yeah, it'll be there, like, you know, the Sunday opinion section about three, four weeks ago.

11:16.101 --> 11:18.949
I'll do a search under your name, so it should pop right up.

11:18.929 --> 11:20.231
Right, right, right.

11:20.251 --> 11:21.032
Okay, good.

11:21.052 --> 11:22.494
Don't you love this online culture?

11:22.734 --> 11:26.079
Yeah, it's something else, man, it's something else, you know, so convenient.

11:26.099 --> 11:28.122
Can't live with it, can't live without it, as they say.

11:28.162 --> 11:29.484
It's amazing, isn't it?

11:29.504 --> 11:30.005
It's amazing.

11:30.145 --> 11:30.786
Go ahead, shoot.

11:30.806 --> 11:47.350
So I think that Tupac, you know, certainly was a very important figure and is one of the few figures, I think, who has what authors describe in biblical circles and others as a literary future, that is a person whose life will constantly be the source of new stories

11:47.870 --> 11:55.678
about his possible interpretation and how we refigure him and rethink him in light of our needs at the time.

11:55.738 --> 12:01.523
So I think that Tupac is one of the first guys to survive as an urban legend, or I think he will be.

12:01.824 --> 12:11.914
That is, you know, unlike, say, majority culture where people are always spotting Elvis, people are now claiming that Tupac is not dead, but that he's in Hawaii somewhere living or something.

12:12.274 --> 12:15.497
Well, what's interesting about that is that here's a guy who, because of

12:15.882 --> 12:18.364
the contradictory lessons that he put forth.

12:18.705 --> 12:20.166
On the one hand, to resist violence.

12:20.206 --> 12:22.048
On the other hand, to embrace it wholeheartedly.

12:22.748 --> 12:26.532
On the one hand, to respect the integrity of black female identity.

12:27.132 --> 12:30.976
On the other hand, to engage in rapacious sexual liaisons.

12:31.736 --> 12:43.847
So he was a very complex young man who was struggling toward a definition of himself and trying to figure out what to do with his life, but always giving voice to the deepest struggles of young black males in our society.

12:43.887 --> 12:44.488
So in that sense,

12:44.958 --> 12:45.820
He's a profound figure.

12:45.860 --> 12:48.026
He's certainly not a hero, but he is a tragic figure.

12:48.527 --> 13:02.562
And he's tragic, I think, because he didn't trust the genius of his own ability to represent the ghetto, to represent street life, to represent the harshness of the gangster culture in which he aspired to participate at a certain level.

13:02.862 --> 13:06.286
his representations were just as powerful as the real.

13:06.426 --> 13:09.750
So he fled the representative world for the real world.

13:09.770 --> 13:20.403
And when he got involved in the real world, that is, you know, the trouble he got involved with, the criminal activity that he sometimes, you know, in terms of pistol-whipping somebody.

13:20.423 --> 13:22.165
Romanticized, in fact, didn't he?

13:22.185 --> 13:23.647
Well, it's a deep glamorization.

13:23.787 --> 13:26.150
Glamorization, that's the better word.

13:26.170 --> 13:28.853
And the problem with that, of course, is that

13:29.238 --> 13:44.962
You know, those people who jump on the Tupac Shakurs of the world often miss how the culture in which we live has conditioned them and has given them certain levels of response that they then, when successfully exercised, we then penalize them for.

13:45.422 --> 13:47.245
But we don't talk about the real vulgarity.

13:47.285 --> 13:51.972
The real vulgarity and obscenity was not simply the language he used or the ideals he spoke.

13:52.340 --> 13:55.788
But it was the conditions that provoked him to speak in the first place.

13:55.808 --> 13:57.993
So there are multiple vulgarities there.

13:58.013 --> 13:59.457
There's a lot of obscenity going on.

13:59.918 --> 14:04.008
And I think Tupac was a very powerful figure in that gangster culture.

14:04.108 --> 14:06.574
Now, I think that, again, as I write in the L.A.

14:06.594 --> 14:09.741
Times piece, the tragedy of Tupac is that he didn't trust the genius

14:10.193 --> 14:14.157
his own genius, his own ability to represent that world without trying to live that world.

14:14.677 --> 14:29.252
See, the gospel song, I want to live the life I sing about in my song, that's fine when you're talking about ideals within a gospel worldview, but when it comes to gangster rap culture, this quest for the authentic, this quest for the real, is a deeply problematic one.

14:29.332 --> 14:35.138
Not, of course, peculiar to gangster culture, because for authenticity is throughout black culture.

14:35.371 --> 14:49.785
But I think the way in which it played itself out with Tupac is deeply problematic.

14:50.440 --> 14:57.370
I genuinely admire the honesty with which you recognize the shortcomings.

14:57.390 --> 15:06.444
For instance, you obviously point out the sexist and homophobic views that are expressed in a good deal of gangster rap.

15:06.564 --> 15:11.011
It's important to recognize, to point out the shortcomings.

15:11.051 --> 15:12.533
I mean, you don't...

15:12.513 --> 15:18.161
If you'll excuse me here for jumping ahead here.

15:18.221 --> 15:21.306
You describe yourself as an inveterate polyglot.

15:21.907 --> 15:25.572
How about just picking up a tad on that?

15:25.713 --> 15:33.424
Yeah, well, I think we have to speak a whole host of languages, a variety of rhetorics and styles of speech.

15:33.657 --> 15:36.602
And I say that because, you know, I'm an ordained Baptist minister.

15:36.622 --> 15:38.665
I'm a, you know, PhD from Princeton.

15:38.685 --> 15:42.592
I'm a former teen father, welfare father, and so on.

15:42.632 --> 15:48.322
So, you know, there are a variety of languages that I've learned, appropriated, and tried to distribute.

15:48.342 --> 15:49.303
And they're all relevant.

15:49.624 --> 15:50.425
I hope so.

15:50.485 --> 15:51.086
I think they are.

15:51.106 --> 15:52.088
I think that when we...

15:52.287 --> 15:59.558
You know, we don't want to simply speak the academic speak, as you know, which is... Which basically is worthless if you're trying to reach a wider audience.

15:59.738 --> 16:06.689
Come on, I mean, you know, it's fine if you want to speak to 12 people, and there's virtue in speaking to 12 people for, you know, on certain subjects in certain ways.

16:06.729 --> 16:09.133
I don't, you know, dog that or gain say that.

16:09.153 --> 16:16.624
On the other hand, as you're absolutely right, if we want to, you know, be able to express with a certain amount of moral passion and clarity...

16:17.195 --> 16:21.722
issues that engage us and motivate us to speak in the first place.

16:21.742 --> 16:23.945
We've got to do them in ways that people comprehend.

16:23.965 --> 16:40.710
And I think that in that sense, being a journalist or being a public intellectual, a person who's able to articulate clearly and cogently, hopefully, ideas that affect a broad variety of people and in ways that they comprehend them, or at least they get the point, that's crucial to me.

16:40.730 --> 16:46.138
But I'm also a Baptist preacher, so I think that language of the gospel and the black gospel worldview

16:46.439 --> 16:51.105
is, you know, incredibly important from, you know, articulation as well.

16:51.125 --> 17:02.561
Let's just call, the guy in Allentown just asked me to ask you this question, so it doesn't come for anything that I've got pending, but he said, ask you about Spike Lee's movie on the Million Man March.

17:02.581 --> 17:05.225
I don't know anything about this, but do you have any comment on this?

17:05.445 --> 17:07.748
I've got, you know, my new book, I deal with the Million Man March.

17:07.788 --> 17:13.316
In fact, I've got a 1,500-word piece coming on the Washington Post tomorrow on the Million Man March.

17:13.336 --> 17:14.157
Oh, good, I'll get it.

17:14.297 --> 17:15.619
I want to get the post up here.

17:15.869 --> 17:17.251
kind of unfair kind of Million Man March.

17:17.291 --> 17:39.842
Well, I think that Spike Lee's Get on the Bus is a highly anticipated film that would be a wonderful kind of memento of the spirit of achievement and of love and of sacrifice and of self-reinvention that black men expressed a year ago in the Million Man March, which I participated in with my son and wife, as a matter of fact.

17:40.083 --> 17:45.370
So I think that Spike Lee's Get on the Bus is an attempt somehow to, through a cinematic vision,

17:45.923 --> 18:02.431
you know, explain and examine what was going on there, what drove black men to come to Washington, D.C., what motivated them to move from every nation and, you know, every Hamlet and every city and every county in this nation to converge on Washington, D.C.

18:03.252 --> 18:10.665
The Million Man March, it seems to me, was important because regardless of what one believes about black men marching to D.C.,

18:11.017 --> 18:23.889
that it rebutted vicious stereotypes about black men, that they're violent, that they don't love one another, that they can only, you know, get together for causes of catastrophe and suffering, not of celebration of our own virtues.

18:24.489 --> 18:38.442
And I think that the Million Man March, you know, as elementary as that sounds, and as fundamental as that appears, certainly contributed to a, you know, to Americans rethinking black men, and it also gave black men a boost

18:38.827 --> 18:59.692
not only to their egos, but to their self-definition, that they can and should engage in criticizing crime in their communities, becoming more responsible for their own lives and lifestyles, and that they should begin to build a culture that's much more positive and healthy and productive than ones that are destructive and negative and vicious.

18:59.752 --> 19:01.594
So I think that was a very important point.

19:01.827 --> 19:05.252
moment for the African-American men in this country.

19:05.272 --> 19:10.059
And just briefly, I mean, this whole debate over the actual numbers seems so ridiculous to me.

19:10.139 --> 19:10.880
Oh, it's just stupid.

19:10.940 --> 19:13.083
As if it wasn't a million, but maybe 800,000.

19:13.243 --> 19:15.266
Or maybe 1.2 million.

19:15.747 --> 19:16.608
Exactly.

19:16.668 --> 19:20.434
The point is that, but I was there, and I have no doubt, forget those numbers.

19:20.454 --> 19:21.655
I mean, it was more than a million men there.

19:21.756 --> 19:24.139
I mean, I was standing there on the stage.

19:24.440 --> 19:29.580
What's interesting is that as if it was only, you're right, 750,000, oh my God, it was a failure.

19:29.601 --> 19:32.492
Well, that still would have constituted the largest

19:32.928 --> 19:35.792
you know, gathering of any kind in our nation's capital.

19:35.852 --> 19:37.514
It was a historic, monumental achievement.

19:37.534 --> 19:42.902
And plus, in this day of instant communication, people were there without having, without actually being there.

19:43.102 --> 19:44.243
Oh, man, millions more before.

19:44.264 --> 19:45.265
You know, because this was covered.

19:45.345 --> 19:47.488
I mean, you know.

19:48.449 --> 19:50.212
Listen, you've got a thing coming up.

19:50.312 --> 19:52.154
Oh, you want me to send something to you?

19:52.174 --> 19:54.337
Send it to the university or give me... Okay.

19:54.357 --> 19:58.042
The 5125 Oak Brook Drive.

19:58.243 --> 19:58.663
Two words?

19:58.703 --> 19:58.924
One word.

19:59.464 --> 19:59.965
One word.

20:00.417 --> 20:03.360
And that's Durham, North Carolina, 27713.

20:04.581 --> 20:08.045
Okay, what I'll do is I'll send you my Dorothy West piece.

20:08.285 --> 20:10.268
Oh, man, I'd love to see it.

20:10.308 --> 20:17.555
I got a letter from her editor after Jackie at Doubleday, unsolicited, and he said this is by far the best piece.

20:17.575 --> 20:18.957
He said, I never write journalists.

20:18.977 --> 20:22.060
He said, this is the best piece that anybody has done on Dorothy West.

20:22.100 --> 20:23.882
Thank you for writing it, something like that.

20:24.343 --> 20:25.224
Man, wonderful.

20:25.524 --> 20:27.466
Well, I got it.

20:27.506 --> 20:28.467
Put all your stuff in there, too.

20:28.447 --> 20:29.708
The whole works.

20:29.728 --> 20:31.049
And we'll connect.

20:31.430 --> 20:32.250
We're going to get together.

20:32.350 --> 20:32.991
Yeah, we're going to do that.

20:33.011 --> 20:34.672
I want you to give me a buzz back.

20:34.692 --> 20:36.054
Come on down here and we'll spend a day.

20:36.194 --> 20:37.175
I think it sounds good.

20:37.195 --> 20:39.517
And in the meantime, I'll get in touch with Addison Wesley.

20:39.557 --> 20:42.900
And I do think it's great that you're going out to a trade publisher.

20:43.380 --> 20:43.560
Right.

20:44.041 --> 20:50.046
Because I love Oxford, but I had to call three bookstores to get that book last night.

20:51.067 --> 20:52.328
And that's why I went with Holt.

20:52.388 --> 20:54.069
I mean, Yale wanted to do my book.

20:54.109 --> 20:54.750
I love Yale.

20:54.810 --> 20:55.731
But give me a break.

20:55.791 --> 20:57.432
I want more than 1,000 people to read it.

20:57.592 --> 20:58.453
Thank you, man.

20:58.433 --> 20:59.518
And that's the thing.

20:59.538 --> 21:05.747
And see, there's interest in the kind of stuff... You know, that was a collection of my journalism between God and Gangstrap, so that's an audience that could have been reached.

21:05.867 --> 21:07.093
You know, now, Oxford...

21:07.327 --> 21:13.937
They did sell, you know, for, you know, using an academic book might sell, what, 1,400 copies, but that might have sold, like, 14,000.

21:14.417 --> 21:17.402
Yeah, well, without any advertising.

21:17.422 --> 21:19.365
Well, you know, without a whole lot, you know.

21:19.385 --> 21:20.867
Yeah, so, I mean, that's remarkable.

21:21.167 --> 21:26.495
Yeah, so, you know, and the book I did on Malcolm, of course, was named one of the notable books of, you know.

21:26.515 --> 21:27.537
Well, I just read, you know.

21:27.677 --> 21:32.464
So that book, you know, did well, and then the book before that, Reflecting Black.

21:32.724 --> 21:34.747
Yeah, well, I mean, I went to the public library yesterday.

21:34.788 --> 21:36.490
They didn't have...

21:36.470 --> 21:53.162
