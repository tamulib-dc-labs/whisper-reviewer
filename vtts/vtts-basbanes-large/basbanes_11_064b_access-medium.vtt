00:01.870 --> 00:10.665
I don't know how many of these, but it was assumed always that the addition was small and the number of 200 was floating around.

00:12.327 --> 00:24.908
We know that the Siberian snakes in us Galileo tells us that 550 copies per thing, but it sold so fast that he practically had none left for the students.

00:25.310 --> 00:32.744
The Dialogone we know is printed in a thousand, but we don't know how many of them in the Inquisition lot before they were sold.

00:34.889 --> 00:41.361
There has been a literature that Newton's first edition principally was something over 400.

00:41.864 --> 00:47.491
And we know for sure from the correspondence that 750 were made a bit.

00:47.831 --> 00:55.541
Now let's predict what numbers can survive if the survival rate is the same for all the books.

00:56.041 --> 01:02.710
And we'll use as a base this number and the number for the second edition of 30.

01:02.730 --> 01:07.095
And you'll see on the next slide the predicted numbers in LL.

01:07.075 --> 01:22.277
And now you see three striking discrepancies.

01:23.238 --> 01:26.383
So what do you make of it?

01:26.617 --> 01:42.404
A very, very thorough survey being made by the Bishop Raffi that's kept very long shows that this nation holds very strongly even when we look at all the copies in Europe and many copies of the same town.

01:43.265 --> 01:51.038
So I can only judge that it was a promise for Harvard to have so many copies as we do all in the United States.

01:51.338 --> 02:01.134
that really its clarity is such that it's not all that much more common than the Copernicus laws.

02:01.254 --> 02:03.037
And so something fishy is going on there.

02:03.538 --> 02:06.302
And Kaplan had papers for a thousand copies.

02:06.583 --> 02:11.611
There is no way that book was worn out for over the years.

02:11.631 --> 02:18.021
You just have to figure that Kaplan wants to use some of the paper to pay off the printer.

02:18.254 --> 02:27.603
and that they didn't actually print 1,000 of them, the chances are that they would print a date something like 500 a day.

02:30.126 --> 02:33.449
On the Siderius Rosius, it's a very small book.

02:34.330 --> 02:46.422
I learned from Roger Stoddard early on when I was advising Margaret about buying a stone, I was buying some myself, that if you have a very little book, it gets lost.

02:46.908 --> 02:48.070
It's thrown away.

02:48.150 --> 02:53.858
It doesn't survive nearly as much as a big stake in a book like you live others.

02:54.880 --> 03:01.529
I suspect that the Sidereus Gnosius of Gallio were simply read today.

03:02.471 --> 03:04.434
The copies were literally worn out.

03:04.834 --> 03:06.316
The readings were too small.

03:06.396 --> 03:07.498
They were chucked out.

03:08.069 --> 03:14.996
The problem with Newton is I think people have just guessed very badly about the size of the addition.

03:15.797 --> 03:20.542
It has to have been almost as large as the second addition.

03:21.363 --> 03:28.190
So let's look at the final numbers on the next slide in which I have now made some adjustments.

03:28.210 --> 03:31.714
The Principia has to be something over 600.

03:31.897 --> 03:36.083
They would often think that it's probably something like that.

03:36.503 --> 03:40.368
Here's information about English and science.

03:41.009 --> 03:55.329
Based on statistics, it's all numbers, and it is based on a very false assumption that the attrition of the revolution, none of us can be the same as the attrition of a book published 150 years later.

03:55.709 --> 04:00.756
Now, we had an extra hundred century in Iraq to lose how to get the Genesis book.

04:00.736 --> 04:05.504
So, there is some fechiness about what I've done here.

04:05.524 --> 04:11.653
It can't be totally right, but it gives you a ballpark of this.

04:11.673 --> 04:18.684
So now I have to ask, how come do books get destroyed?

04:18.945 --> 04:20.107
Why don't they survive?

04:21.108 --> 04:26.777
And the law record, the lawyer comes down to know, the greatest enemy of books is why?

04:26.757 --> 04:53.743
I was on the Yale Library in the visiting community for five years, and the very first thing that happened to us when we got there was to have a tour of Stirling Library, which had all those beautiful tables in it, so on, to see all the places that we used.

04:53.723 --> 05:03.387
And it came down in damaging ways where it already crashed, just some shortly before I started on the committee.

05:03.407 --> 05:10.163
So after all this millennia, architects still do not discover how to make moves that will leave.

05:10.379 --> 05:14.204
And you get lies, and so on.

05:14.224 --> 05:20.472
You look at copies of the character system, and at least a third of them have absolutely done it.

05:20.632 --> 05:23.176
It is just a great edit book.

05:23.196 --> 05:31.206
The worst case, I can show you on the next block, and this is from a great book called the edit book, is the letter book.

05:31.321 --> 05:41.260
sad, tragic case of this great library was the Pennelly Library that was being shipped from Venice around the Naples.

05:41.641 --> 05:43.184
Tyrants captured the ship.

05:43.625 --> 05:49.176
They were so outraged that it had nothing to focus on, that they built them overboard.

05:49.676 --> 05:54.105
And that included a copy of the First Edition of the Benefits.

05:54.085 --> 05:58.209
So that is one instance of document.

05:58.229 --> 06:08.601
Wayne's book, one of the books on this in the last century, has this story all mixed up, because there was a second female writer that was auctioned in London two centuries later.

06:08.981 --> 06:12.024
It has nothing to do with this story.

06:12.044 --> 06:18.051
The next slide will show us something about the second greatest name of the book, which is

06:18.908 --> 06:32.826
Rodents and worms, this is actually silverfish from Robert Cook's Mycordathia, and the next slide also from White Book, which has been done by the Netwatch Eagle.

06:33.607 --> 06:40.056
We're told, by the way, that they do come to his library, and Oxford is going to be closed now for a year.

06:40.036 --> 06:52.120
because, in fact, they have misestimated how badly the Death Watch field has done in the rafters up above, the roof, and they're going to have to close up again and go to work reconstructing.

06:52.140 --> 06:59.074
As far as I know, the Death Watch field is not pouring holes in their collection in present time.

06:59.054 --> 07:01.320
And rodents.

07:01.340 --> 07:14.515
I wanted to take a slide of several of my books that we can actually see the team marks in it, and I forgot to do this yesterday, but I do have an interesting slide from the Carnegie Institution of Washington Library.

07:14.495 --> 07:20.586
where they were moving their library and they had to put the books in storage for about three months.

07:21.087 --> 07:31.946
When they put them on the sledges and carefully covered them in parts so they wouldn't get wet, but they forgot for the first two or three weeks to put the math boys in it.

07:31.966 --> 07:37.296
And as a result, for the Bronkman, they just have got all these books with no smartphones.

07:37.512 --> 07:46.503
The rats didn't go after the books themselves, but they made the spine of hundreds of books from their life there.

07:46.523 --> 08:02.642
Five, a distant third, excepting for the books that are, that are bombed, and there have been a number of them lost in the last century in that way.

08:02.622 --> 08:13.199
Well, I didn't want to end with this kind of scene, so let me show you Perrinicus, simply because he's been the hero of my story here.

08:13.219 --> 08:25.339
And then finally, since it looked like this, I thought I should show you Perrinicus's library, which is one of those things that was not destroyed in the war, it survived, because it was captured.

08:25.319 --> 08:30.505
It was captured by the Swedish troops and taken off to Sweden.

08:30.926 --> 08:44.523
And it's now in Uppsala where I had to get those books stanched by filling out several dozen cards for each book individually because they were filed according to their subject matter.

08:45.284 --> 08:47.226
And then,

08:47.206 --> 08:49.849
wonderful security over there.

08:50.149 --> 08:52.492
This book is in the observatory library.

08:53.313 --> 09:02.124
So I carried it over from the observatory into the main library to order a photograph and carried it back.

09:02.664 --> 09:08.711
And he was never challenged any longer in his new membership.

09:09.012 --> 09:16.200
Because this has to bring his own handwriting in his copy of this particular book.

09:16.180 --> 09:28.695
It is a wonderful library, and I have to say, as a result of looking at all these of the book, it was pretty funny looking at the annotations.

09:28.715 --> 09:34.041
But Kestler wasn't private, but he said it was an all-time worst seller.

09:34.682 --> 09:42.711
What I found is that copies were owned by the Asian music theoretician, Giuseppe Mizzarino, by the Astoria Architect,

09:42.691 --> 09:53.055
by Juan de Herrera, by the Piaz Thompson-Tayard, by the humanists Llanas Sambucas and Pietro Francesco Giambolari,

09:53.238 --> 09:56.843
one of the copies that's gone to Japan in the last decade or so.

09:57.525 --> 10:00.930
By the antiquaries, John Albrey and William Camden.

10:00.950 --> 10:05.857
By the financier, Johan Yackel-Huber, who night popped in himself, I'm sure I can.

10:06.739 --> 10:22.182
By Henry the second, Philip the second, George the second, Sigismund the second, Augustus, Count Egmont, the electorate Paul Heinrich, and by Luke August, whose library both of them was considered the finest in Europe in the early 18th century.

10:22.162 --> 10:23.043
by St.

10:23.083 --> 10:36.860
Dolorzius Gonzaga, by Gerdano Bruno, by Thomas Diggs, DiProgramme, Galileo, Kepler, and a host of other lesser known medical doctors, astrologers, and miller doctors.

10:36.921 --> 10:46.853
Now these royalties did not annotate their books, but they considered it important to have them in any collection that attempted to be complete.

10:46.833 --> 10:55.417
Many of the rest of these people did annotate their books, and chasing them down has been a wonderful journey over the past few decades.

10:55.437 --> 10:57.282
Thank you.
