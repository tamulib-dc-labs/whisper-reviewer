WEBVTT

00:02.444 --> 00:03.986
Just that again?

00:04.006 --> 00:06.749
G-R-I-B-B-E-N.

00:06.909 --> 00:20.967
And Alan Gribben is a professor in the English department who has written about Mark Twain as a book collector.

00:20.987 --> 00:25.732
And he has gotten this assignment to do this biography of ransom.

00:26.653 --> 00:31.219
And I cannot imagine a less imaginative

00:31.891 --> 00:38.321
more flat-footed choice of people to come up with.

00:38.341 --> 00:43.569
But he has gotten himself an excuse from his teaching assignment to do this.

00:44.230 --> 00:45.992
Yeah, but it sounds like a house job, though.

00:46.393 --> 00:46.793
It is.

00:46.994 --> 00:48.596
I'm certain to be a house job.

00:48.656 --> 00:52.662
I'd call it the critical biography would be a misnomer in all.

00:53.183 --> 00:55.486
I mean, he's tenured, so at least that helps.

00:55.607 --> 01:00.514
Well, I don't think that he is not the kind of person who would necessarily

01:00.781 --> 01:04.966
You don't go in-house to get an objective biography out of it.

01:05.587 --> 01:30.096
And I'm not exactly certain what has gone into the commissioning selection process, but they have, apparently, working with him, Graves Landrum, who is a man surely retired, a name that I have always known as someone who was always kind of an executive vice president type,

01:30.447 --> 01:31.488
in the system.

01:31.788 --> 01:37.395
Maybe he was in the development office or, and he's always been a company man.

01:37.415 --> 01:40.458
And they have been going through ransom files.

01:41.699 --> 01:59.138
And I understand that last week there was a big meeting about the status of ransom files and whether other people would ever be allowed to see them or not, which I cannot believe has anything to do

01:59.523 --> 02:02.166
It is.

02:02.226 --> 02:03.427
They want to know when I'm coming.

02:03.707 --> 02:05.349
They've turned me over to this guy here.

02:05.429 --> 02:10.434
And this is unprecedented for me.

02:10.474 --> 02:12.236
They asked me for questions in advance.

02:13.978 --> 02:19.063
He doesn't ask for the questions there, but he called me.

02:19.083 --> 02:20.425
I was on vacation in Florida.

02:20.445 --> 02:21.025
He reached me.

02:21.045 --> 02:22.067
He found me in Florida.

02:22.487 --> 02:25.530
They're kind of in a panic about your coming.

02:25.790 --> 02:26.391
You think so?

02:26.624 --> 02:27.345
I think they may be.

02:27.365 --> 02:29.107
Well, do you think this letter was a mistake?

02:29.127 --> 02:31.870
I'll shut this off.

02:32.110 --> 02:35.594
Well, I think that you are, there are a lot of people who know.

02:36.575 --> 02:42.181
Tom doesn't really know that much about the stories that went on.

02:42.261 --> 02:45.825
That does give him a level of deniability, which is good, too.

02:46.066 --> 02:54.555
Not deniability, but which would mean perhaps that he could talk, frankly, about what he had nothing to do with.

02:54.923 --> 02:56.945
But yes and no.

02:58.527 --> 03:03.473
Tom is very much a forward-looking kind of guy.

03:04.114 --> 03:11.082
He is not going to wrestle with Ransom's ghost.

03:11.583 --> 03:14.647
He's going to go on and be his own Ransom.

03:16.189 --> 03:23.277
And his predecessor, Decker Turner, a very controversial director of the end,

03:23.459 --> 03:33.873
He really wrestled with Ransom's ghost.

03:33.893 --> 03:35.536
And... Decker Turner did.

03:35.576 --> 03:36.577
Decker Turner did.

03:37.118 --> 03:48.674
And recreated a lot of the Ransom myths and overstated a lot of the... And really kind of muddled the record terribly, I think.

03:49.655 --> 03:53.280
And I think that there are a lot of people who knew Ransom.

03:53.480 --> 04:01.768
and who were there at the time, who would be much better witnesses for you, if that's really what you want to get back to.

04:01.788 --> 04:04.250
Well, I would just like a little bit of color, you know?

04:04.290 --> 04:05.911
Well, I don't think you'll get it from Tom.

04:06.212 --> 04:07.533
Yeah, but I'm going to be there for two days.

04:08.714 --> 04:09.154
Three days.

04:10.255 --> 04:14.139
Well, um... I mean, really, two hours, I think I'll get what I need from Tom.

04:14.900 --> 04:19.344
Well... Two hours are kind of better to help you, repeating the questions.

04:19.364 --> 04:20.905
I mean, I think that my...

04:21.070 --> 04:27.837
I'm not going to tell you how to write the book, but Tom really wants to talk about his own ideas about the collection.

04:28.197 --> 04:34.123
And he is not an inconsiderable collector, because you know what his background is at Tulsa.

04:34.263 --> 04:34.843
Right.

04:35.003 --> 04:37.125
Well, Tulsa had a lot of money, too.

04:37.206 --> 04:44.192
And Tulsa wanted to create a collection from scratch, just the same way HRC had done.

04:44.272 --> 04:44.793
Did they?

04:44.853 --> 04:45.534
Yes, they did.

04:46.034 --> 04:47.636
And Tom came down.

04:47.816 --> 04:49.137
Tom was the dean.

04:49.454 --> 04:51.276
And Tom was the ransom.

04:51.856 --> 04:54.018
And Tom came down to the HRC.

04:54.479 --> 04:57.161
He's a very beguiling, charming guy.

04:57.181 --> 05:06.911
And he said, I want to do everything right that you have done and avoid anything wrong that you can tell me that I should avoid.

05:07.531 --> 05:09.333
And how do you work this?

05:09.353 --> 05:10.614
And can I see your forms?

05:10.674 --> 05:13.157
And what kind of shelves do you use?

05:13.237 --> 05:14.698
And how do you get your collections?

05:14.879 --> 05:18.482
And he really built the idea.

05:18.783 --> 05:39.604
took the idea of modern, and he limited it to British collecting, and really at a time when the acquisitions fever was cooling off at Texas, he was able to get a lot of things that would have normally gone to Texas and worked with the same dealers and some of the same people.

05:42.607 --> 05:46.731
One person who used to work at Texas ended up to a time that's ahead of the

05:46.981 --> 05:49.745
of the Special Collections Library at Tulsa.

05:49.865 --> 06:10.592
Now, you've heard, you've talked to some people in Texas that are aware of my... Well, one of the assistant directors, or the assistant director, Sally Leach, I was with in Chicago over the weekend, and she told me that they were having this big flap about the access to the ransom papers.

06:11.053 --> 06:16.600
And I said, well, don't you think it's because it doesn't have anything to do with McBadsey's Cummings?

06:16.850 --> 06:22.336
And apparently she had a message from you, so it was a very small one.

06:22.517 --> 06:43.161
But there are people like Warren Roberts, who was the director of HRC from 1965, or whenever it was officially created, to 1978 or so.

06:43.563 --> 06:47.367
who was there and worked with Ransom and built the collection.

06:48.148 --> 06:48.768
Is he there now?

06:48.789 --> 06:48.889
Yeah.

06:48.949 --> 06:49.750
He's retired.

06:50.050 --> 06:51.571
He lives on Windsor Road.

06:53.313 --> 06:54.775
I have a double number down.

06:55.155 --> 06:57.097
Is it Windsor with a D?

06:57.117 --> 07:00.301
I think it was a D, mm-hmm, and then the house of Windsor.

07:00.921 --> 07:11.072
And the other person who's been there every blow-by-blow step of the way is Bill Todd, William B. Todd, and they live on Exposition.

07:13.533 --> 07:22.707
And his wife, Ann Baden, was the first librarian of the Academic Center, which was the library that was created to house a lot of materials.

07:22.727 --> 07:24.189
I'm new to the story, okay?

07:24.249 --> 07:28.816
Again, this is one of these stories where I've been working on it for a while.

07:28.836 --> 07:31.300
And people say, you've got to go to Texas.

07:31.521 --> 07:33.904
And I say, well, what am I going to see there besides a great collection?

07:34.205 --> 07:35.186
It's a great story.

07:35.407 --> 07:37.009
I say, well, has anybody written it?

07:37.681 --> 07:38.362
And what is it?

07:38.783 --> 07:41.867
What is the Texas story, as you know it?

07:41.887 --> 07:43.449
Tell me what I can use and what I can't use.

07:43.469 --> 07:44.211
I'd just like to know.

07:44.511 --> 07:45.252
You can use any of it.

07:45.793 --> 07:46.554
Shoot.

07:47.495 --> 07:50.259
Did you mind if we found out there?

07:52.242 --> 08:02.237
In the late, there was, at the University of Texas, a history of rare books, special collections.

08:02.639 --> 08:05.763
You can go back to Wren, you know.

08:05.783 --> 08:10.449
Yes, there was a Latin American collection, an extremely fine one, still is there.

08:11.250 --> 08:17.778
There was a Texas history collection, still there, very fine one.

08:17.798 --> 08:32.376
And there was what was called the Stark Library, which included the Stark was a Texas collector, Mrs. Stark from Orange, Texas, and the Wren Library were the two largest collections.

08:32.947 --> 08:43.723
very fine, very traditional 18th, 19th century literary collections, autographs and first editions.

08:44.685 --> 08:54.820
And Dr. Ransom, in the late 50s, wanted to build a library of the

08:55.188 --> 09:01.036
He started out as an English professor.

09:01.097 --> 09:04.221
He rose rapidly through the campus ranks.

09:04.321 --> 09:08.948
He was even briefly president of the UT campus.

09:08.968 --> 09:12.573
But this was all happening so fast.

09:12.693 --> 09:20.765
They were creating the University of Texas system, and he became eventually the chancellor of the University of Texas system.

09:21.766 --> 09:24.250
And he started as an English professor.

09:24.803 --> 09:33.617
and a copyright expert, and no stranger to textual studies, but not really strictly a bibliographer.

09:33.637 --> 09:41.770
And he wanted to build up the library all over, you know.

09:41.790 --> 09:42.311
Not just Austin?

09:42.351 --> 09:44.775
Not just, but, well, mostly just Austin.

09:44.915 --> 09:46.498
Austin's always been the flagship.

09:46.518 --> 09:49.022
But he really wanted to build up

09:49.272 --> 09:52.557
Not just the special collections, but all of the libraries.

09:52.577 --> 09:56.003
But he really concentrated on the research collection.

09:56.023 --> 10:02.232
And this idea of the Humanities Research Center really took form in the late 50s.

10:03.174 --> 10:16.815
And the idea was to concentrate on 20th century, but not exclusively 20th century materials, modern art and letters and film and photographs.

10:17.065 --> 10:21.672
And not exclusively living, but mostly British-American.

10:22.293 --> 10:25.178
And humanity is very broadly interpreted.

10:25.999 --> 10:32.890
And they acquired tremendous things by gift, as well as by purchase.

10:33.150 --> 10:38.138
But the first big purchase that they made was the Hanley collection.

10:38.699 --> 10:40.461
Now, you want an interesting collector.

10:40.922 --> 10:43.065
That T.E.

10:43.125 --> 10:45.469
Hanley, Ed Hanley.

10:45.888 --> 10:58.161
was an oil man from Bradford, Pennsylvania, and he collected D. H. Lotz and George Bernard Shaw and all these manuscripts.

10:58.381 --> 11:11.254
They had so much stuff, and they also collected art, not of the same quality, but they had so many paintings that they were hanging on the ceilings in the bathroom and on the backs of the closet doors.

11:11.892 --> 11:20.721
And among his most interesting collections was his wife, Tula, who was a belly dancer, and her sister, Ami.

11:21.162 --> 11:22.383
Do you know this?

11:22.403 --> 11:24.826
And they lived in Bradford, Pennsylvania.

11:24.846 --> 11:35.317
And Tula Hanley, who claims to have been, to have slept with most of, all kinds of assorted people, wrote a biography.

11:35.357 --> 11:39.942
She used to get arrested all the time for correcting the youth of Bradford.

11:40.242 --> 11:42.925
She wrote a book that was- Bradford, Pennsylvania.

11:42.985 --> 11:43.746
Bradford, Pennsylvania.

11:43.766 --> 11:44.726
How did this get to Texas?

11:45.287 --> 11:45.567
Money.

11:47.049 --> 11:48.150
They buy it through Lou?

11:48.370 --> 11:49.551
Through Jake Schwartz.

11:50.172 --> 11:50.853
Jake Schwartz.

11:50.913 --> 11:52.494
He was a dentist.

11:52.514 --> 11:53.295
Jesus Christ.

11:53.756 --> 11:55.677
And painful extractions.

11:56.358 --> 11:58.660
Painless extractions, I mean.

11:58.680 --> 12:01.904
How did he get to sell books to Texas?

12:02.324 --> 12:08.190
Carlton Lake wrote a piece in the New York Times a couple of years ago.

12:08.356 --> 12:23.109
You know, the bottom half of the book review, bottom page of the book review that tells the whole story about Hanley and Jake Schwartz and Samuel Beckett, who Beckett collection, the Beckett materials were also involved in all this.

12:23.129 --> 12:27.213
But anyway, Hanley was the first big collection.

12:27.293 --> 12:32.198
His wife, the motto in writing her biography was, I aspire to inspire before I expire.

12:33.839 --> 12:34.940
She wrote this book?

12:34.960 --> 12:35.260
Yeah.

12:35.661 --> 12:36.081
No.

12:36.402 --> 12:36.962
Was it published?

12:37.988 --> 12:40.771
I don't think it's widely available.

12:40.791 --> 12:42.413
Well, Widener Library might have it.

12:42.433 --> 12:44.054
I don't think so.

12:44.074 --> 12:44.895
What's the name of it?

12:44.975 --> 12:46.998
It's something, it's really a schlock book.

12:47.018 --> 12:47.378
That's okay.

12:47.859 --> 12:56.207
But at any rate, Hanley was this first big collection, and that was acquired in 1958.

12:56.227 --> 13:03.355
And with that, this was the first big collection that they got.

13:03.807 --> 13:07.412
And I think they spent a million dollars for it.

13:07.432 --> 13:08.413
That's 32 years ago.

13:08.433 --> 13:08.894
That's a lot of money.

13:08.914 --> 13:12.238
Yeah, but I mean, like the corrected page proofs for Ulysses.

13:12.419 --> 13:17.566
Whoever would have thought this guy out of some place in Pennsylvania would have a collection like this.

13:17.886 --> 13:24.595
They had so much stuff in the house that the insurance company wouldn't let them keep the modern manuscripts in the house.

13:24.996 --> 13:28.060
So they had like a multi-car garage, and they got...

13:28.208 --> 13:29.049
metal footlockers.

13:29.069 --> 13:29.889
That's a great story.

13:29.970 --> 13:31.731
And put them in between the things.

13:31.751 --> 13:32.332
How do you know all this?

13:32.352 --> 13:34.453
Is this a fact or is this written something?

13:34.473 --> 13:35.975
No, there's a lot.

13:35.995 --> 13:37.996
There are people who have been there.

13:38.497 --> 13:44.682
And the two people I can think of who have been there most specifically both worked on the George Bernard Shaw thing.

13:45.383 --> 13:52.629
One of them is Stanley Weintraub, who is at Penn State.

13:52.649 --> 13:57.253
And the other one is Dan Lawrence, L-A-U-R-E-N-C-E.

13:57.807 --> 14:05.320
who is a senior, very senior Shaw scholar.

14:06.161 --> 14:16.700
And both of them were at Bradford as graduate students, you know, worked there and were, you know, entertained and had couscous and whatever.

14:16.720 --> 14:21.388
Did this guy die for us before the collection was there, or did he sell it?

14:21.508 --> 14:22.650
Did it go before he...

14:23.407 --> 14:28.033
I think he was alive when it came, but maybe he died shortly thereafter.

14:28.494 --> 14:40.851
But Dr. Ransom convinced the legislature to use part of the oil money from the state to build the library collection.

14:41.692 --> 14:45.657
And it was committed a million dollars a year for ten years.

14:46.238 --> 14:51.164
Is this in, do you think this will be in newspaper clips and stuff?

14:51.525 --> 14:51.625
Yeah.

14:51.824 --> 15:05.358
I mentioned this to you, there's this little pamphlet called Building 20th Century Collections, or something like that, that is a house piece at HRC, and has a picture of the building on the outside.

15:05.378 --> 15:09.041
And that tells, I don't think I have, I know I don't have one here.

15:09.102 --> 15:11.164
And that tells a lot of this same story.

15:11.284 --> 15:12.785
No, it doesn't give any of this stuff, though.

15:12.805 --> 15:15.108
Well, it, yeah.

15:15.408 --> 15:16.789
Let me ask you a question.

15:16.809 --> 15:19.452
I'm a guy writing a book about book collections.

15:19.938 --> 15:24.549
I'm looking for nice stories.

15:26.133 --> 15:28.178
Why should I get excited about my?

15:29.040 --> 15:29.962
They want me there.

15:30.323 --> 15:33.971
They're welcoming me, and they're saying, can you tell us what you want to talk about?

15:33.992 --> 15:35.896
And I thought that letter was vague enough.

15:36.056 --> 15:36.558
Do you think so?

15:37.299 --> 15:38.402
Very harmless letter.

15:39.293 --> 15:40.915
Oh, no.

15:41.195 --> 15:43.297
These people don't have anything to hide.

15:43.377 --> 15:46.241
Look how many hundreds of decades later it is.

15:46.261 --> 15:46.741
Is it embarrassing?

15:46.761 --> 15:47.502
There's nothing embarrassing.

15:47.522 --> 15:50.385
I've got quotes from three people, and I will use them, and I'll name the people.

15:50.405 --> 15:56.592
Nicholas Barker, Roger Studd at the Houghton Library at Harvard, and Bob Nykirk at the Groglia Club.

15:56.632 --> 16:06.583
And they've all said, in other words, what people say is indiscriminate collecting at Texas is sour grapes.

16:07.306 --> 16:10.850
sour grapes, because the collection is what counts.

16:10.870 --> 16:19.741
And according to Barker, Ransom is on record as saying, this money doesn't last forever, and let's do it while we can, because we'll never have the opportunity again.

16:19.761 --> 16:21.623
Now, I don't see what's wrong with that, really.

16:21.663 --> 16:22.965
There's nothing wrong with it.

16:23.305 --> 16:25.127
There are a lot of things that went on.

16:25.147 --> 16:26.829
It may not be Marcus of Queensbury rules.

16:27.130 --> 16:31.475
Maybe Luke Feldman is not Dr. Rosenblatt.

16:31.555 --> 16:33.918
And it's not just that.

16:33.958 --> 16:35.119
There are a couple of things.

16:35.369 --> 16:38.493
This doesn't answer your question, but this is a clause on my mind.

16:39.133 --> 16:47.684
A lot of people, and Turner was chief among them, who went on and on and on about this ransom syndrome, he called it.

16:47.784 --> 16:52.049
That's a very majority term, I think, but this ransom syndrome of collecting.

16:52.069 --> 16:53.330
That's a common loose phrase, isn't it?

16:53.350 --> 16:55.232
Turner's the only one who ever used it.

16:55.513 --> 16:56.274
Turner, again, is?

16:56.514 --> 17:02.541
This unfortunate director who Staley replaced.

17:02.892 --> 17:04.554
Turner said the Ransom Syndrome?

17:04.574 --> 17:05.195
He called it.

17:05.215 --> 17:05.915
He used that phrase?

17:05.955 --> 17:06.476
Yes.

17:08.238 --> 17:09.659
That is interesting to me.

17:09.960 --> 17:10.941
Oh, listen.

17:10.981 --> 17:12.563
Did he directly succeed Ransom?

17:12.783 --> 17:14.084
No, no, no, no.

17:14.745 --> 17:21.452
Ransom was never the director of the HRC, except maybe like for two minutes while he was creating it.

17:21.773 --> 17:23.314
He was always up here.

17:23.495 --> 17:24.296
He was a mover.

17:24.356 --> 17:25.156
He was the mover.

17:25.176 --> 17:26.017
He was the deal-maker.

17:26.077 --> 17:27.499
He was the deal-maker.

17:27.682 --> 17:33.610
And the nominal director of HRC from its inception was Warren Roberts.

17:33.630 --> 17:38.836
Warren Roberts was booted out through political fisticuffs.

17:38.856 --> 17:41.199
And this guy's alive and well and living in Austin, Texas.

17:41.399 --> 17:44.043
Yeah, with two new hips and three new knees.

17:45.104 --> 17:45.945
They know my dates.

17:45.965 --> 17:49.350
They're probably going to send him to Acapulco when I'm done.

17:50.051 --> 17:50.471
Yeah, yeah.

17:51.332 --> 17:57.520
And he, and Roberts was there until, as I recall, it was like 78.

17:57.770 --> 18:06.799
And then we had this kind of interim business, and Turner came in about 80, 80, let's say.

18:07.900 --> 18:10.262
And they suffered with him.

18:11.343 --> 18:12.625
I left in 83.

18:13.145 --> 18:14.266
And you started there when?

18:16.809 --> 18:20.132
Part-time in 71.

18:21.193 --> 18:24.557
And why don't you just tell me what you did when you were there?

18:24.577 --> 18:26.038
Well, I used to be the airplane girl.

18:26.693 --> 18:35.966
I worked for two years in the History of Aviation collection, one of the more tangential collections.

18:37.488 --> 18:42.495
And I did, you can quote me, nothing, absolutely nothing.

18:44.378 --> 18:48.003
And then I worked in the director's office.

18:48.023 --> 18:50.326
Is it a strong aviation collection, at least?

18:50.386 --> 18:50.727
There is.

18:50.767 --> 18:54.692
They gave it to UT Dallas, the History of Aviation Collection.

18:55.178 --> 18:57.801
They flew it up to now.

18:57.821 --> 19:02.946
They had a sailplane and all kinds of things.

19:02.966 --> 19:17.202
And then I worked as, basically, I had different titles, but I eventually became the research librarian, and I helped the people who were working on the research, doing research in the management collection.

19:18.283 --> 19:24.730
But Ransom, this, yes.

19:25.351 --> 19:37.487
The only time I ever went to him was I spent lots of my time trying to go back and sort out the history of the acquisition of various things and solve various mysteries about present-day problems.

19:37.867 --> 19:39.029
Is this stuff all documented?

19:40.951 --> 19:42.633
I mean, in the proceedings or something like that?

19:42.653 --> 19:43.695
No, there's no proceedings.

19:44.276 --> 19:46.779
Well, I mean, it's a state-owned institution.

19:46.799 --> 19:53.147
I mean, they must have records that indicate where we got something and for whom we bought it and how much we paid.

19:53.633 --> 20:02.006
But not in any kind of a, you know, ledger book kind of thing that you would have access to.

20:02.066 --> 20:05.792
Well, I'm sure, open records, I mean, could you get access to all that?

20:05.812 --> 20:09.137
Oh, and we know how much Rosenbach paid for the Ulysses manuscripts.

20:09.698 --> 20:13.303
Well, the public auction.

20:13.323 --> 20:14.585
Well, that's just an example.

20:14.605 --> 20:18.471
But you had records of his trips to England, I mean, you know, where he did.

20:18.491 --> 20:19.793
His records were not complete.

20:20.633 --> 20:24.418
Yeah, but he's not a state-mandated institution, either.

20:24.478 --> 20:35.532
Well, the record-keeping has always been not altogether straightforward.

20:36.894 --> 20:41.260
What I was going to say is I often was trying to untangle a lot of things.

20:41.781 --> 20:48.970
And the only time I would ever see Ransom, I would sometimes go into his office to ask him about, you know,

20:49.270 --> 20:53.836
What was the background of this particular thing, and this is the problem I would have?

20:54.417 --> 20:56.000
And he would say, always.

20:56.100 --> 20:58.403
I never got an answer other than this.

20:58.423 --> 21:01.467
Well, my child, that's a very complex matter.

21:01.507 --> 21:03.350
I'm like, I know what you think I'm in here for.

21:03.410 --> 21:05.393
Do you think I would have waited for three weeks to read you?

21:05.413 --> 21:06.635
In response to what kind of a question?

21:06.675 --> 21:07.576
Give me a direct question.

21:07.676 --> 21:08.938
Oh, let's see.

21:08.958 --> 21:10.460
I'm not being evasive.

21:10.480 --> 21:11.802
I'm only being forgetful.

21:12.242 --> 21:17.590
But let's say I was trying to figure out...

21:17.722 --> 21:23.511
Oh, there was a big hullaballoon once about these Rembrandt etchings.

21:25.133 --> 21:26.275
I mean a big hullaballoon.

21:26.575 --> 21:30.741
I don't think I asked Dr. Ransom this because I think he must have.

21:30.782 --> 21:33.065
I don't think I was involved with this, but it would be a kind of thing like this.

21:33.706 --> 21:45.163
Dr. Ransom bought a large collection of miscellaneous prints, etchings, for study purposes.

21:45.532 --> 21:48.876
They paid something like a dollar a piece for them.

21:49.637 --> 21:55.564
And some, and most of them, some of them were probably worth 50 cents.

21:56.526 --> 22:02.553
But some of them turned out to be Rembrandt etchings, or maybe were always known to be Rembrandt etchings, or whatever.

22:03.314 --> 22:08.821
And they were always intended kind of for study and office decoration.

22:09.622 --> 22:12.906
And some of them, at one point,

22:13.612 --> 22:29.027
Through Dr. Ransom's assistant, Frances Hudson, who is this, she took a lot of her praise with her, I'm sure of that, were lent to a big private dormitory that was having a big opening.

22:30.109 --> 22:38.897
The Hardin House was having a big opening, and they were having a kind of a little university town and gown kind of thing, and they had an exhibition over there.

22:39.338 --> 22:43.602
And that's the last anybody could ever find any record of these Rembrandt things.

22:43.936 --> 22:57.877
Well, it probably is not what happened to them, but some graduate student got on this kick about doing a project cataloging the Rembrandt etchings in the various collections at the university.

22:59.139 --> 23:05.830
And it ended up being turned over to the university auditors.

23:07.031 --> 23:11.378
And it was a big, big, big, hullabaloo.

23:11.746 --> 23:15.530
But anyway, it would be sometimes things like that, trying to track down.

23:15.550 --> 23:19.655
Is stuff covered pretty well in the Austin newspapers, or do you think Dallas?

23:19.755 --> 23:20.777
Not Dallas.

23:20.797 --> 23:24.902
And only very spottily in the Austin newspaper.

23:24.962 --> 23:29.647
If I wanted to go read some stuff that is outside of the university, where would I go?

23:29.747 --> 23:30.528
Library Journal?

23:30.548 --> 23:32.170
I mean, do they do anything on this?

23:34.773 --> 23:38.918
There have been a number of articles

23:39.505 --> 23:45.935
fairly large, comprehensive articles written about the Texas collection.

23:47.497 --> 23:50.642
The London Observer did a big article.

23:52.504 --> 23:54.587
With any of the stuff that you're talking about?

23:54.808 --> 23:58.373
No, it was just more, much more an overview kind of thing.

24:00.616 --> 24:03.100
I mean, this thing about this Rembrandt thing, you asked

24:03.552 --> 24:08.298
It would be kind of mindless little tracking down problems with individuals.

24:08.318 --> 24:10.200
Did he have any feel for what he was getting?

24:10.821 --> 24:11.301
Oh, sure.

24:11.321 --> 24:26.699
There were some things that he did that were very controversial, and Robert and Todd supported this even more so.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.222
They felt, for instance,

24:29.945 --> 24:42.980
that multiple copies of 20th century literary texts were important to acquire for comparison and collation purposes.

24:43.401 --> 24:45.123
But they have 41 Ulysses.

24:45.223 --> 24:47.045
Yeah, 41 and a half or whatever it is.

24:49.087 --> 24:56.656
Now that is, they said it was the same thing as Folger and First Folio.

24:56.676 --> 24:58.078
Of course, Folger's been accused of

24:58.666 --> 25:02.891
And not sharing with scholars, either.

25:02.911 --> 25:12.863
And you look at the stacks at Texas, and here they are, you know, eight copies of the first edition of Lady Chattery's Lever, you know, 20 copies.

25:13.324 --> 25:18.791
And it just seems to be ridiculous in the minds of a lot of people.

25:18.891 --> 25:26.580
Not only did they jack the prices of modern firsts and certainly 20th century manuscripts up,

25:26.932 --> 25:30.976
But then they bought much more than they could ever use or need.

25:31.576 --> 25:56.398
But this ransom syndrome that Turner referred to, he made claims that ransom was the first person who ever realized that the history of the text starts before the first edition.

25:56.952 --> 26:21.660
I mean, Turner was shown to be such an ass in the minds of the book world, and a very bizarre character, but it was such a, I found it such a derision of what Ransom

26:21.775 --> 26:25.839
was doing because he was making claims that Ransom himself never made.

26:26.019 --> 26:26.620
Such as?

26:26.640 --> 26:34.407
And that he was the first person to recognize the value in collecting modern literary papers.

26:34.648 --> 26:35.949
Well, what are the Bhatnikis?

26:35.969 --> 26:37.330
You know, what was all that about?

26:37.610 --> 26:38.671
Joe Clinton.

26:38.692 --> 26:41.094
Yeah.

26:41.294 --> 26:50.483
And this whole bullshit about the first person to recognize that the history of the text began with the

26:50.547 --> 26:57.859
before the first edition and back through the page proofs and the galleys and the manuscripts and the drafts and things.

26:58.500 --> 26:59.802
Well, it's just stupid.

26:59.822 --> 27:02.747
And so a lot.

27:02.767 --> 27:10.941
You don't necessarily need to talk to Johnny-come-latelys about the ransom syndrome or whatever.

27:10.981 --> 27:17.331
If you're going to talk to anybody and not rely just on published accounts,

27:17.834 --> 27:24.183
I certainly would think you should talk to people who were there, rather than people who were there.

27:24.203 --> 27:27.187
And you gave me three names.

27:27.207 --> 27:35.579
Yeah, and there are, and Sally Leach has been there much longer than anybody else on the staff now.

27:35.599 --> 27:36.481
She works?

27:36.501 --> 27:38.163
She works in Tom's office.

27:38.403 --> 27:44.772
She is the assistant director, unless Tom tells her not to, and I don't know.

27:45.013 --> 27:46.575
Ray Dom doesn't know anything.

27:47.028 --> 27:48.911
Ray Dalm came to H.R.C.

27:48.931 --> 27:50.893
with the Gloria Swanson collection.

27:51.374 --> 27:53.277
Which Howard Gottlieb lost.

27:53.617 --> 27:54.919
That's in my story.

27:55.740 --> 27:56.601
He was wooing her.

27:56.621 --> 27:58.043
I've got a wonderful book.

27:58.063 --> 28:00.006
You know Howard Gottlieb with Boston Boys.

28:00.426 --> 28:01.989
And he said, I was going to her house.

28:02.009 --> 28:06.194
He said, I was eating macrobiotic foods that was coming out of my ears.

28:06.735 --> 28:08.918
And he said, and I wake up one morning and I read.

28:09.269 --> 28:15.258
I hear on the radio that they sold the glorious Swanson collection to Texas for a million dollars.

28:15.318 --> 28:28.699
Well, and, I mean, Turner's the one who got the Selznick and got the Swanson and got the... Well, that's a pretty big money, though.

28:28.939 --> 28:31.343
Oh, really?

28:31.363 --> 28:34.568
I couldn't even know that.

28:34.767 --> 28:37.611
We bought them at auction for Texas.

28:37.631 --> 28:38.072
Which papers?

28:38.192 --> 28:39.053
I don't know.

28:39.134 --> 28:39.674
Whose papers?

28:39.694 --> 28:41.297
They needed them.

28:41.317 --> 28:46.404
But he got this Uzielli collection, and the Four-Timer collection.

28:47.145 --> 28:56.019
I mean, I just think that was pretty ... I think I'm just against the Four-Timer collection because Turner bought it.

28:56.740 --> 29:04.251
And Ransom and the Four-Timer family talked for years and years about amalgamating those two collections.

29:04.602 --> 29:08.226
But it all turned out, in the end, to be pretty funny.

29:08.286 --> 29:14.414
His nephew has the finest collection of espionage books.

29:14.434 --> 29:15.195
Did you know that?

29:15.215 --> 29:19.640
In fact, he took out a whole suite at the Watergate.

29:20.201 --> 29:21.983
He was a charter member of the CIA.

29:22.003 --> 29:23.205
It's very interesting.

29:23.225 --> 29:25.467
I'm going to be going to see this guy.

29:25.488 --> 29:28.832
Are you going to talk about the Fort Simon in your book?

29:28.852 --> 29:28.952
Yeah.

29:28.972 --> 29:29.192
Oh, yeah.

29:29.307 --> 29:32.531
Larry McMurtry is a great story.

29:32.551 --> 29:34.393
She's a writer and a book dealer.

29:34.413 --> 29:37.237
A Cadillac Jack is about a scout.

29:38.058 --> 29:42.744
She just has some very interesting things.

29:42.764 --> 29:43.224
It's going to be fun.

29:43.245 --> 29:45.527
Does the book sound interesting, by the way, that I'm doing?

29:45.567 --> 29:45.808
Oh, yeah.

29:45.828 --> 29:46.408
That sounds great.

29:46.509 --> 29:50.474
We're already buying copies.

29:50.554 --> 29:53.998
I'll describe how you get.

29:55.227 --> 30:00.673
Texas has always felt very much on the defensive.

30:00.693 --> 30:06.199
And there were a lot of things subject to much... You mean because of the technique that they use to acquire?

30:06.459 --> 30:07.200
Right, and there are a lot.

30:07.220 --> 30:08.060
Not because of the product.

30:08.101 --> 30:09.602
The product is world class.

30:09.622 --> 30:13.266
Well, there's a lot of crap there, but there's a lot of... Roger Kennedy at the Smithsonian.

30:13.306 --> 30:19.152
I mean, to drop names, but I just talked to him last week.

30:19.172 --> 30:22.235
He did a book on Greek revival of America, and I know him anyway.

30:22.255 --> 30:24.778
In fact, not mentioning you, but I...

30:25.012 --> 30:30.861
throughout the quote about, you know, how do you feel about places that buy a lot of junk?

30:31.703 --> 30:32.924
No, in fact, I didn't say junk.

30:32.985 --> 30:37.572
I said, I used your analogy of the sunken wreck.

30:38.333 --> 30:43.781
And he said, but you know, he said, sometimes the junk is, you really have to look at the junk.

30:43.822 --> 30:47.607
He runs the American Museum of National History.

30:47.628 --> 30:49.230
Yeah, where they collect a lot of junk.

30:49.582 --> 30:53.468
And he said, you have to really look at junk to understand the masterpiece.

30:53.488 --> 30:56.392
He said, sometimes if you just look at the masterpiece, you really don't know.

30:56.432 --> 30:59.396
He said, I'm all for junk.

30:59.777 --> 31:03.081
He gave me, which is a great quote, you know, I'm all for junk.

31:03.182 --> 31:07.688
Well, there's stuff in Texas, you know, like history of sports collection.

31:07.728 --> 31:08.910
Well, you know, they don't need that.

31:09.330 --> 31:10.051
Baseball.

31:10.111 --> 31:12.335
Yeah, but somebody... Drawers of baseball.

31:12.675 --> 31:14.438
I mean, they even have a woman's ashes.

31:14.458 --> 31:15.559
Did you know that?

31:15.820 --> 31:17.462
But the Boston Athenaeum has a...

31:17.847 --> 31:22.011
A highwayman's memoir is bound in his own skin.

31:24.514 --> 31:32.422
So, I mean, there are all kinds of... And the great quote is, from the guy that runs the athleticism, it has no literary merit whatsoever.

31:32.442 --> 31:36.867
It's the binding that makes it interesting.

31:37.408 --> 31:44.395
But the thing at Texas is that there were a lot of things that were very controversial as far as acquiring all this stuff,

31:44.746 --> 31:58.147
buying it on credit through a limited number of dealers, getting so far out on the limb in terms of they had stuff in-house that they wouldn't pay for for three years hence.

31:58.167 --> 32:00.050
Much less leaving stuff in-house.

32:00.070 --> 32:00.691
Okay.

32:00.711 --> 32:02.214
They were getting collections.

32:03.095 --> 32:08.003
They'd already spent this year's millions, but they were still getting stuff.

32:08.185 --> 32:10.308
And Fellman's going to sell them.

32:10.328 --> 32:12.091
Okay, this is on next year's million.

32:12.191 --> 32:13.213
And Fellman didn't care.

32:13.493 --> 32:17.279
Fellman didn't care because they were going to pay him 10% on the money.

32:18.460 --> 32:24.650
And then when they got to like the third year out, Fellman's still sending the stuff.

32:24.670 --> 32:27.895
They're buying everything and auctioning all these private sales.

32:28.075 --> 32:30.198
All these deals are coming to them.

32:30.218 --> 32:35.526
They got nervous thinking, my gosh, what if

32:35.945 --> 32:48.121
the sky falls in, and we don't have this money, and we should not be—well, we didn't want to process the collection anyway—but we shouldn't even be making it available to people unless it's really anors.

32:48.781 --> 32:56.591
So they started restricting big collections, saying that it would not be available until such-and-such a time.

32:57.152 --> 32:59.455
So often, given the kind of

32:59.755 --> 33:05.322
you know, not cavalier, but dramatic way, a lot of this stuff was being acquired.

33:05.642 --> 33:09.147
Things were being snatched right out from under people's noses.

33:09.167 --> 33:12.451
There were situations where scholars had been working on papers.

33:12.831 --> 33:18.218
They're sold to Texas, and then they're told that they can't have access to them for two or three years.

33:18.238 --> 33:22.603
Well, that's enough to wrinkle a few people's scouts.

33:23.004 --> 33:27.990
And so there are a lot of things like that that just created a lot of

33:28.308 --> 33:37.039
What would you like to know about Texas that you don't know, having worked there?

33:37.059 --> 33:39.181
Would you pretty much feel you know all the answers?

33:39.201 --> 33:44.568
I mean, is that pretty much it?

33:46.450 --> 33:53.338
If you were me looking to nail something down, what would you think I should be looking for?

33:53.358 --> 33:55.341
I feel very positive about the place.

33:56.322 --> 33:57.403
I do not think

33:58.227 --> 34:13.503
Texas is a very frontier kind of society, and there has been a lot of politics, a lot of money thrown in to kind of mix things up.

34:13.563 --> 34:24.775
There's been a lot of heads have rolled up and down the aisle, and I think that's all part of the fun of it all.

34:25.261 --> 34:31.026
You always took sides, and you always knew what sides you were on, and, you know, that was always part of it.

34:31.487 --> 34:42.217
But I think the immutable value of what's there is, you know, without... Why do you suppose Ransom chose to work with one guy in New York?

34:42.557 --> 34:43.318
I don't know that.

34:44.659 --> 34:53.648
And I'm not saying he was the only one, and certainly Anthony Roeder and the firm of Bertram Roeder limited in that.

34:54.100 --> 35:01.247
But I've heard stories that some people might come and offer something to Texas at a decent price.

35:01.267 --> 35:02.208
Texas won't buy it.

35:02.869 --> 35:03.810
You sell it to him.

35:03.850 --> 35:09.416
You give it to Feldman, Feldman will bring it to Texas and double the price, or whatever the factor is, and they'll buy it.

35:10.417 --> 35:20.367
And people like Rendell make the same claim that he couldn't sell stuff to Texas, but that he could sell it to Johnny Jenkins, and that Johnny could sell it.

35:20.387 --> 35:23.230
Johnny's going to know the whole story all by himself.

35:23.716 --> 35:27.481
According to the New Yorker piece, he didn't sell that much to Texas.

35:27.501 --> 35:28.723
He didn't.

35:30.105 --> 35:34.391
But Johnny had kind of a once-a-year sale for Texas.

35:34.411 --> 35:41.681
And Johnny would come in the day the money was released, if not before, but kind of on that kind of thing.

35:42.101 --> 35:45.726
And he would have a little set deal.

35:45.766 --> 35:47.569
This is what he's going to sell this year.

35:47.989 --> 35:51.394
And some of that stuff would be stuff that Rendell...

35:51.661 --> 35:55.164
You're talking about the guy from Boston, Rendell?

35:55.484 --> 35:58.047
Yeah.

35:58.927 --> 36:02.911
Rendell is all the time yelling at me about... He's very close.

36:02.931 --> 36:03.952
He's right next door.

36:04.732 --> 36:13.460
And Rendell goes berserk on this subject, because he says, you know, I would offer this stuff to Texas, and they wouldn't even look at it.

36:14.141 --> 36:15.742
But I would sell it to Johnny.

36:15.922 --> 36:17.944
He loved that story I wrote.

36:17.964 --> 36:18.765
Yeah, you told me that.

36:18.825 --> 36:21.567
He wrote a letter to the magazine, the best piece.

36:22.407 --> 36:31.579
But Ken basically sold, and always sold, autograph collections.

36:32.160 --> 36:34.223
And Texas didn't buy autograph collections.

36:34.863 --> 36:38.168
But they bought a bunch of stuff from— Well, they bought a lot of manuscript stuff.

36:38.188 --> 36:39.349
But not an autograph.

36:39.790 --> 36:47.520
You know, autograph—an autograph dealer, an autograph collector values a single-page letter.

36:48.412 --> 36:51.836
It can be framed before the prints of the person or photographs and so on.

36:52.136 --> 36:58.564
And a premium is paid for a single-page letter because the signature and the address and the text are all on the same side.

36:58.584 --> 37:02.008
And that's not, that has to do with the research value of the piece.

37:02.529 --> 37:14.924
The best letter that a president ever wrote the day after he got out of office is probably worth less to a manuscript collector because the premium is paid for the things written while he's now.

37:14.944 --> 37:16.866
Who's the president that only was in for one month?

37:17.403 --> 37:19.125
You know, he died right away.

37:19.886 --> 37:22.890
That's why his stuff, they say, is... Yeah, he doesn't know.

37:22.910 --> 37:23.590
Whatever.

37:23.610 --> 37:24.051
Nick Cannon?

37:24.692 --> 37:25.132
No, no, no.

37:25.152 --> 37:27.135
One of the most forgettable presidents ever.

37:27.155 --> 37:27.635
Yeah, yeah.

37:27.655 --> 37:28.857
Because he died so quickly.

37:29.037 --> 37:39.409
He got sick in his... But his stuff is... Anything he signed while he was president is worth a ton, worth a fortune, because he was helping president for such a short time.

37:39.429 --> 37:44.355
But I'm not saying that Texas didn't buy autograph kind of stuff.

37:44.707 --> 37:47.870
So Rendell might have an axe to grind, in other words.

37:47.890 --> 37:54.956
Yeah, but Ken has done lots for Texas and has done a lot of appraisals for Texas.

37:55.016 --> 37:57.899
I'm not looking to do a number on Texas, by any means.

37:59.020 --> 38:09.129
I'm a collector who believes that the collection really is in itself, as long as you didn't kill anybody for it or break a lot, you know, or commit any felonies to get it.

38:09.209 --> 38:13.633
I think part of the issue has always been, also, that ransom dealt.

38:13.765 --> 38:16.347
moved in very mysterious ways.

38:18.369 --> 38:30.982
Do you think he was a believer in the Gordian knot theory of Alexander the Great, don't untie the knot, just cut it with a knife, the sword, and this decisive, expeditious way of doing things?

38:31.162 --> 38:31.762
No, no.

38:31.782 --> 38:32.723
Oh, God, no.

38:34.105 --> 38:37.748
So he went through the channels and he did the red tape stuff?

38:37.768 --> 38:38.088
No.

38:38.989 --> 38:42.793
What I mean is that Ransom was a dreamer.

38:43.415 --> 38:48.079
And he left the execution to other people.

38:48.099 --> 38:55.066
I have seen letters that Ransom wrote to, for instance, Earl Stanley Gardner.

38:57.448 --> 39:12.342
In convincing Gardner, and all of the Gardner papers and books and everything, but there is a letter, several letters, that Ransom wrote to Gardner.

39:12.727 --> 39:31.130
about how the Earl Stanley Gardner collection will serve as the centerpiece for understanding the 20th century mind and, you know, the seminal nature of law enforcement in our, you know, world today.

39:31.811 --> 39:35.135
But it is like melodies.

39:39.401 --> 39:39.561
Yes.

39:40.385 --> 39:42.748
You don't get much of a sense of time when you're reading through files.

39:42.768 --> 39:44.030
Do you think a letter like that is accessible?

39:45.432 --> 39:45.793
I don't know.

39:45.813 --> 39:46.594
It's in the file.

39:46.994 --> 39:54.445
But Ransom told everybody, whether the collection was being purchased or bought, that they were going to be the center of attention.

39:54.986 --> 40:00.033
And I once had in mind that they would create this kind of a lazy Susan deal.

40:00.093 --> 40:02.176
Quick, quick, you know, collector X is coming.

40:02.537 --> 40:06.763
Dial that into the rotary deal so his collection room would come up.

40:06.963 --> 40:08.265
Let me tell you a story.

40:09.342 --> 40:12.665
Howard Gottlieb at BU, you know Howard, a charming guy.

40:13.686 --> 40:15.848
And he invited my wife and I to a dinner one night.

40:16.089 --> 40:17.430
I've forgotten about his name.

40:17.450 --> 40:21.914
Big, big Hollywood director, married to Edward G. Robinson's widow.

40:22.315 --> 40:23.956
Big collector.

40:24.897 --> 40:28.000
And at this dinner party was Mike Merrill, Betty Davis' son.

40:28.120 --> 40:31.183
In fact, she died a week after.

40:31.203 --> 40:35.167
I was sitting with Mike, and I said, what is Howard's trick?

40:35.327 --> 40:36.008
How does he do it?

40:36.578 --> 40:41.483
And this other woman who was there, and they both agreed, he writes wonderful letters.

40:41.503 --> 40:42.905
He cares.

40:42.925 --> 40:44.406
Nobody writes letters anymore.

40:44.426 --> 40:47.610
And maybe Ransom was doing the same kind of thing.

40:47.650 --> 40:48.731
He said, you have no idea.

40:48.751 --> 40:59.162
Some of these people, like my mother or whomever, to get a wonderful, charming, informative, thoughtful letter goes a long way.

40:59.443 --> 41:00.604
He said, he writes beautiful letters.

41:00.864 --> 41:01.585
I said, that's it?

41:01.605 --> 41:06.450
He said, you know, I stroke them, I guess.

41:06.616 --> 41:15.068
But Ransom, there was no way that anybody could deliver on all the promises that Ransom came up with.

41:15.088 --> 41:17.011
But did anybody expect them to either, I wonder?

41:17.652 --> 41:18.553
Oh, sometimes.

41:19.214 --> 41:21.257
Like, I mean, what do you mean promises?

41:21.277 --> 41:22.199
To individuals?

41:22.679 --> 41:36.319
To individuals, to heirs, to, you know, things like, oh, they have Evelyn Wallet's papers, his library, all of his manuscripts, his diaries,

41:36.704 --> 41:39.147
Not all of his manuscripts, but the manuscripts that he had.

41:39.807 --> 41:43.191
And you want to know what I want to know?

41:43.692 --> 41:46.775
Where is the wainscoting of Evelyn Wall's library?

41:46.795 --> 41:48.257
Because apparently we bought it.

41:48.677 --> 41:51.741
And I never saw it in those 13 years that I was there.

41:51.761 --> 41:59.009
And it might be out in storage in North Austin, or it might have been eaten by the tournament a long time ago, or it might be in somebody's den.

41:59.029 --> 42:00.771
I can't imagine anybody wanting it.

42:01.291 --> 42:02.552
I know where his desk is.

42:02.573 --> 42:04.334
I know where his ink stand is.

42:04.435 --> 42:06.677
I know where his pins and nibs are.

42:06.978 --> 42:10.804
But I don't know where the wainscoting is off of the walls.

42:10.824 --> 42:21.039
But there was an idea that if you're buying the library, somehow the idea got involved that it would all be ensconced in an actual installation.

42:21.740 --> 42:30.232
And they had paid all kinds of hullabaloo and brokerage fees to get the wainscoting through customs and all that kind of stuff.

42:30.252 --> 42:34.098
But I never saw any plans to actually build it.

42:34.218 --> 42:35.059
It was paid for, right?

42:35.380 --> 42:36.141
Oh, I'm sure so.

42:37.302 --> 42:53.221
And with the Earl Stanley Gardner room, they were going to recreate, they have recreated this study, you know, and you punch this button and this tape recording of Earl Stanley Gardner talks about this stuffed blowfish on his desk.

42:53.241 --> 42:55.083
Do I get to see all this stuff in him there?

42:55.324 --> 42:55.484
Sure.

42:55.524 --> 42:56.485
Sure stuff.

42:56.505 --> 43:07.258
And all of his citations from every little, you know, support your lowest local police department association and all this stuff.

43:07.677 --> 43:19.752
It's in a room where you can walk around and look in the windows, and apparently they took all these detailed measurements for the whole thing.

43:19.872 --> 43:20.793
So they replicated it?

43:20.813 --> 43:35.811
They replicated it, and in fact, after they got it in, or after the stuff had come and had been shipped out from California, the architect in the building department or something needed to take a few more measurements

43:36.179 --> 43:46.670
And I think this was all like in a study that might have been like in a separate little house or something that Gardner's wife wanted to turn into like a playroom for their grandchildren or something.

43:46.690 --> 43:56.361
So after the second the stuff had been carted out, she had a wall-to-wall kind of an indoor-outdoor carpeting put in there.

43:56.761 --> 44:02.828
And the architect thought that it had been there all along and went to great pains to have it reproduced.

44:03.128 --> 44:10.338
as an underlayment for the rugs and things, and really it was just added after that.

44:10.598 --> 44:15.625
But those stories don't have anything to do with the real history of what that institution is about.

44:16.246 --> 44:29.524
I think that when Texas bought its Gutenberg Bible, which Bill Todd was very much involved with getting

44:30.736 --> 44:34.199
And this is very late in life that this was gotten.

44:34.920 --> 44:39.505
There was much discussion about the fact that it was instant ivy.

44:41.386 --> 44:44.069
That was crazy down there.

44:44.089 --> 44:59.224
And certainly the acquisition of the Forzheimer books was seen as in a fell swoop to be able to compete with the

44:59.744 --> 45:06.593
with the more traditional collection of rare books in the nation.

45:07.554 --> 45:10.297
And... Was that a phrase used down there, instant idea?

45:10.317 --> 45:10.417
Yeah.

45:11.819 --> 45:25.236
And I don't think it would appear that way in the Board of Regents minutes, but... But I mean people... People, I mean... ...in the corridors and... Yeah, I mean, and there was all... Well, was it said with a snicker, or... A little bit of a snicker, actually, a snicker.

45:25.256 --> 45:26.798
But the idea being...

45:27.183 --> 45:30.006
Who could not get enough to Gutenberg Bible?

45:30.387 --> 45:33.029
I mean, we don't have one in Boston, you know.

45:33.050 --> 45:36.734
Well, we don't have one in Philadelphia, either.

45:36.754 --> 45:37.755
The widens have one.

45:39.136 --> 45:40.678
Dr. Rosenbach had lots of them.

45:40.698 --> 45:43.301
It's not a rare book.

45:43.321 --> 45:49.187
But, I mean, why did we have to have one?

45:50.168 --> 45:54.253
Why wasn't having the greatest 20th century collection good enough?

45:54.841 --> 45:56.243
What's the motivation?

45:56.523 --> 46:00.509
If some rich oil guy buys it, take it, for God's sakes.

46:00.890 --> 46:03.494
Nope, nope, that's not the way it works.

46:03.514 --> 46:04.475
That's not the way it works.

46:04.595 --> 46:05.677
And would you disagree with that?

46:07.039 --> 46:11.285
Um, all I'm saying... I just don't see it in my backyard as somebody else's.

46:11.846 --> 46:13.168
Oh, I guess that's true.

46:13.188 --> 46:13.569
I don't mind.

46:13.589 --> 46:16.333
There were three of them on the market at the time we bought that one.

46:16.813 --> 46:17.795
Did you get a complete one?

46:19.517 --> 46:19.798
Mm-hmm.

46:19.818 --> 46:20.819
Not enveloped, of course.

46:20.879 --> 46:21.080
No.

46:22.382 --> 46:23.363
Um, but...

46:24.878 --> 46:30.927
I think maybe part of the Texas story, which other people have written about, is the why.

46:31.588 --> 46:47.032
I mean, was there the legendary pride of a Texan, and how is it manifested in this kind of institutional electing?

46:47.794 --> 46:52.641
But I want to tell you that most people in Texas

46:53.650 --> 46:57.676
don't know anything about HRC or what's there.

46:57.876 --> 46:59.078
It's irrelevant.

46:59.098 --> 46:59.939
Irrelevant.

46:59.959 --> 47:01.321
To my point of thinking.

47:01.341 --> 47:04.004
There are 50 colleges in Boston.

47:05.266 --> 47:06.368
I don't know how many of them.

47:06.388 --> 47:09.132
I've never heard of the Houghton Library of Messages.

47:09.152 --> 47:11.635
It's a historical society in the Athens.

47:11.655 --> 47:14.760
And the treasures there are as rich as anywhere.

47:16.021 --> 47:20.147
But it would be total wounds to 90 percent of the population.

47:20.427 --> 47:22.290
And this is, we're talking about pretty

47:22.574 --> 47:28.319
Well, and you also have to consider the nature of the collection.

47:28.740 --> 47:47.277
I mean, the man on the street is more likely to have heard of George Washington, you know, and therefore be impressed that there are George Washington letters in a collection than he has heard of D. H. Lawrence, or Dane Edith Sybil, or Schechevril Sybil.

47:47.477 --> 47:48.719
I'm going to ask you one question.

47:48.739 --> 47:50.320
I'm going to try and catch a five o'clock plane.

47:50.536 --> 47:53.040
I see the 5 o'clock and 9 o'clock.

47:53.060 --> 47:54.542
I think I'll grab the 5.

47:55.443 --> 48:00.470
And this came to me this morning at 5.15 or so.

48:00.490 --> 48:01.431
I was driving to the airport.

48:02.032 --> 48:11.746
But do you think that there is such a thing as bibliomania on the institutional level?

48:11.846 --> 48:13.909
And I wonder if Texas is the example of that.

48:15.511 --> 48:20.138
Certainly, Texas has been bibliomania.

48:21.063 --> 48:30.111
When you talk about having X number of Lady Charlie's lover, there is no sense to that.

48:30.191 --> 48:32.914
Now, I have to say, that's going too far as a book.

48:32.934 --> 48:33.294
No, no.

48:33.614 --> 48:34.956
There could be a sense to it.

48:35.836 --> 48:42.162
The idea of the fact that there might have been textual changes within the press.

48:42.182 --> 48:43.904
If that's the case, but it probably isn't.

48:44.004 --> 48:48.348
And also, this is the copy that was owned by Lady Oddline Morrell.

48:48.388 --> 48:51.070
That's an entirely different argument.

48:52.045 --> 49:03.256
But if they are acquiring this title to get as many copies of the first printing as they can, I just don't .

49:03.276 --> 49:09.522
Well, bibliomania is subject to many different definitions and interpretation.

49:15.969 --> 49:20.533
But I think that it's not necessarily a bad thing.

49:21.408 --> 49:25.372
Well, the title of my book is A Gentle Madness.

49:25.592 --> 49:28.715
Well, I think there has to be a certain .

49:28.735 --> 49:28.896
.

49:28.916 --> 49:29.176
.

49:29.356 --> 49:36.103
I'm one myself, you know, and I confess it's like .

49:36.123 --> 49:36.483
.

49:36.503 --> 49:37.124
.

49:37.144 --> 49:49.997
Yeah, there has to be a certain amount of madness for an institution to buy things, but they have really no guarantee are going to be

49:50.500 --> 49:55.107
relevant to research or .

49:55.127 --> 49:56.369
It's a gut feeling.

49:56.389 --> 50:01.377
Well, what motivates somebody or some place to go crazy?

50:02.158 --> 50:13.555
That's an incorrect word, but to do things, to acquire books that you would never do for anything else.

50:13.755 --> 50:16.520
I mean, you know, you'd go out to dinner.

50:16.540 --> 50:19.444
You'd say, geez, 100 bucks or something for dinner.

50:19.694 --> 50:26.540
to spend $500 for this John Cheever, John Cheever's first book, which comes to mind, $600.

50:26.620 --> 50:33.426
Oh, it's wonderful, you know, mint, dust jacket, and without even breaking Sprite, you know, send it to me.

50:34.047 --> 50:40.092
I can't speak to the motivation of individual book collectors.

50:40.112 --> 50:40.993
I can have it.

50:41.033 --> 50:41.754
I have to have it.

50:41.794 --> 50:43.255
That's the phrase you hear all the time.

50:43.275 --> 50:44.496
I have to have it.

50:44.516 --> 50:47.879
Yeah, I can't speak to that, because I'm not bitten by that bug.

50:48.120 --> 50:48.520
I don't.

50:49.057 --> 50:54.284
It must amuse you to see it, too.

50:54.505 --> 50:56.508
I appreciate it in other people.

50:56.528 --> 50:59.993
They have the money, and that's fine.

51:00.634 --> 51:12.951
But I think that most collections that I have dealt with are dealing, institutional collections, are dealing more with research for public education.

51:13.412 --> 51:16.076
Texas is by no means alone, by the way, in this.

51:16.096 --> 51:18.439
I mean, the Lilly Library in Wilmington.

51:18.723 --> 51:20.245
the University of Illinois.

51:20.366 --> 51:23.751
You can go any number of... Cornell.

51:23.771 --> 51:25.814
Yeah, but within the last 30 years, you know.

51:26.976 --> 51:28.518
Are you going to talk to Lola?

51:29.099 --> 51:29.640
Lola who?

51:30.001 --> 51:31.263
Lola Gladys.

51:31.363 --> 51:32.044
I don't know her.

51:32.064 --> 51:32.605
Who is she?

51:32.625 --> 51:35.169
She's the librarian of the Burke Collection.

51:35.610 --> 51:36.311
Lola?

51:36.331 --> 51:39.195
Lola Gladys.

51:39.596 --> 51:41.839
S-Z-L-A-G-I-T.

51:42.621 --> 51:43.482
And she is...

51:43.529 --> 51:48.414
the librarian at the Berg collection in the New York Public Library.

51:48.434 --> 51:49.716
Is she an interesting woman?

51:49.736 --> 51:50.337
Oh, yeah.

51:50.357 --> 51:51.258
Why do you say that?

51:51.278 --> 51:53.760
She's a child in the New York Times, what, two years ago?

51:54.061 --> 51:55.202
Yeah, maybe one day.

51:55.222 --> 51:56.744
Three years ago?

51:56.764 --> 51:57.505
It was before Charles died.

51:57.525 --> 51:58.025
She's a book woman?

51:58.666 --> 52:03.011
She is, oh, yes, in the old school.

52:03.331 --> 52:05.814
She's Hungarian.

52:06.475 --> 52:08.437
She's Hungarian.

52:09.438 --> 52:13.182
She wrote a book about the Berg, a pamphlet about the Berg.

52:13.887 --> 52:18.193
as collectors, and it's an extremely fine collection.

52:18.213 --> 52:22.359
And, you know, it's kind of a collector's collection with Anna Baker's first collection.

52:22.379 --> 52:26.625
The Boston Public has an Argentine woman, Monti, is her first name?

52:26.645 --> 52:27.146
Laura.

52:27.166 --> 52:27.626
Laura.

52:27.646 --> 52:29.809
Nice woman.

52:29.829 --> 52:32.793
I'm going to go to the airport, I think.

52:32.813 --> 52:33.194
Okay.

52:33.214 --> 52:34.175
This is good.

52:34.195 --> 52:35.197
Can I have both of you?

52:35.217 --> 52:35.317
Sure.

52:35.337 --> 52:36.218
Talk some more.

52:36.979 --> 52:38.521
And come back.

52:38.662 --> 52:39.102
Oh, I will.

52:39.763 --> 52:42.527
Do you think maybe that shitey letter?

52:42.845 --> 52:45.396
We'll be fine at some point if I call you.

52:45.416 --> 52:47.465
Well, I'll look for it and make a copy for you.

52:47.485 --> 52:48.550
That would be wonderful.

52:49.614 --> 52:52.045
That's the kind of thing, because I will be writing about shiteys.
