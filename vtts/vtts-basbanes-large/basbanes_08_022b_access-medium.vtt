00:02.528 --> 00:09.983
That's all I got so far.

00:10.544 --> 00:16.155
Actually, that wasn't a bad review except for the headline.

00:16.175 --> 00:17.778
I missed that.

00:18.098 --> 00:20.503
The headline was the great horny editor.

00:20.618 --> 00:26.283
And then somebody said, well, at 75, Bradley, you'd better be horny than great.

00:26.303 --> 00:31.267
That must mean they didn't get beyond chapter four or five.

00:32.248 --> 00:33.129
That's John Corey.

00:33.149 --> 00:33.649
You know him?

00:34.390 --> 00:35.991
He's a big arch-conservative.

00:36.052 --> 00:41.116
Arch-conservative and a great son of disciple of AIDS.

00:41.656 --> 00:43.758
It seems to me that you don't have a thin skin, though.

00:43.778 --> 00:49.123
I mean, I think there's so many options over the years that after all these years...

00:49.542 --> 00:51.344
No, you're a Bostonian.

00:52.165 --> 00:53.107
I was a Bostonian.

00:53.487 --> 00:57.472
How do you... God, this city is fantastic now.

00:57.953 --> 01:02.679
You just drive down Commonwealth Avenue, you drive down Boston Street.

01:02.699 --> 01:05.222
It's really a wonderful city to live in.

01:05.242 --> 01:05.703
Fantastic.

01:05.723 --> 01:06.404
You live in the city?

01:06.764 --> 01:07.545
No, I don't.

01:07.585 --> 01:09.147
How's your new house?

01:09.168 --> 01:10.109
Oh, it's wonderful.

01:10.129 --> 01:10.770
You love it?

01:10.790 --> 01:11.871
Oh, it's terrific.

01:12.070 --> 01:16.835
It's a real... They live out near Walden Pond.

01:17.075 --> 01:17.215
Oh.

01:17.515 --> 01:21.659
And beautiful view is overlooking the Sudbury River.

01:23.701 --> 01:24.342
That's a challenge.

01:24.402 --> 01:25.283
Did you just have a menu?

01:26.244 --> 01:27.205
No, I don't want a menu.

01:27.225 --> 01:27.665
I don't know.

01:28.146 --> 01:29.247
You want another something?

01:29.267 --> 01:29.327
No.

01:29.347 --> 01:30.388
Dessert?

01:30.408 --> 01:32.170
No, thank you.

01:32.190 --> 01:32.250
No.

01:32.330 --> 01:33.791
No, don't you take the check.

01:33.811 --> 01:35.813
Let me... No, no, no, no.

01:35.833 --> 01:39.277
I mean, you're a free dancer, you don't need.

01:39.297 --> 01:40.558
Then I'll split it up.

01:41.078 --> 01:47.068
Okay, what's your travel schedule?

01:47.088 --> 01:55.462
Well, I've got... I go to... I'm here until tomorrow morning.

01:55.483 --> 01:58.107
I'm doing something for... MIT tonight.

01:58.167 --> 01:58.768
MIT tonight.

01:58.788 --> 02:01.994
Doing something for Washington Post advertisers tomorrow morning.

02:02.054 --> 02:03.336
I like to do that.

02:03.616 --> 02:05.179
Yeah, right.

02:05.598 --> 02:13.410
And then, I don't know, I've got the David Budnoy.

02:13.430 --> 02:16.055
David Budnoy?

02:16.315 --> 02:17.617
I bought Budnoy the 9th.

02:18.198 --> 02:22.184
And then I've got Letterman on the 5th.

02:22.685 --> 02:23.226
Oh, that's good.

02:23.266 --> 02:24.768
You've got Budnoy after MIT?

02:25.570 --> 02:25.750
Yeah.

02:26.219 --> 02:29.404
MIT could be a little tougher than that.

02:29.745 --> 02:30.907
Who's the audience?

02:31.027 --> 02:33.711
I guess MIT students, huh?

02:33.731 --> 02:36.836
Yeah, but some Waterstones or something to do with it.

02:36.856 --> 02:40.001
We had a big head in the globe yesterday.

02:42.445 --> 02:43.687
Wasn't it at MIT?

02:44.108 --> 02:45.671
You can't see without that.

02:45.691 --> 02:45.991
I know.

02:46.011 --> 02:48.896
I lost the other one.

02:50.118 --> 02:50.218
Shit.

02:50.722 --> 02:57.863
It's a book signing move.

02:58.282 --> 03:03.407
Yeah, Waterstones burned down, and this was supposed to be a Waterstones, so they moved it over to MIT.

03:03.928 --> 03:05.850
It's not necessarily an MIT thing.

03:05.930 --> 03:07.211
But I bet a lot of MIT can't.

03:07.311 --> 03:08.573
Oh, I'm sure it'll be loaded.

03:08.593 --> 03:09.333
Yeah, I'm sure it'll be loaded.

03:09.494 --> 03:11.316
It could be a little tougher than that.

03:11.336 --> 03:13.298
Yeah, but I think he's perfect for up here.

03:13.318 --> 03:18.243
You know, you and I, without any looking, we're inching towards legend status.

03:18.323 --> 03:21.406
Nobody wants a bite out of our ass anymore.

03:21.526 --> 03:24.289
You know, why they don't hit us up?

03:24.269 --> 03:27.596
I interviewed your wife twice in her two novels.

03:27.736 --> 03:28.197
Oh, did you?

03:28.237 --> 03:30.020
And I wrote two stories.

03:30.101 --> 03:31.483
Is she writing more fiction now?

03:31.603 --> 03:40.000
No, she's writing a nonfiction book, but she's way behind because she's writing about experiences in her life that had...

03:40.317 --> 03:49.400
that were important in the growth of her consciousness of being a woman.

03:49.460 --> 03:54.272
She has a couple of fantastic things.

03:54.292 --> 03:56.638
I haven't read all of them yet.

03:57.142 --> 03:59.085
We show each other the beginnings and ends.

03:59.125 --> 04:01.088
We don't... In the middle?

04:01.148 --> 04:03.932
In the middle because, you know, you have to get lost in the middle.

04:04.272 --> 04:05.694
Because she's such a wonderful writer.

04:06.235 --> 04:07.537
Did she edit this at all?

04:07.637 --> 04:09.720
No, she came in at the end of it.

04:09.880 --> 04:11.162
I didn't.

04:11.182 --> 04:12.904
I showed her the beginning of it.

04:12.924 --> 04:18.592
And my youth, which she knew nothing about.

04:19.513 --> 04:22.137
And then I showed her at the end of the book.

04:22.488 --> 04:25.292
That was kind of a, did you have any second thoughts?

04:25.372 --> 04:40.454
I know I did an interview with Ilya Kazan, you know, Ilya Kazan, about his autobiography, which is like 700 pages, and he said, the thing about writing like yourself is the real truth for you is that you have to strip yourself bare and stand naked before the world.

04:40.794 --> 04:44.319
And I think that you've done a lot of that yourself in this particular.

04:44.340 --> 04:45.161
I mean, you really are.

04:45.621 --> 04:46.082
Perhaps...

04:47.311 --> 05:03.885
a little bit too too confessional do you think well some people said something i don't know if it seems to me i decided i would write things that were mocking experiences and i didn't do it gratuitously or to titillate things that changed my life and one of the things

05:03.865 --> 05:07.531
that, uh, I didn't know fuck all about was sex.

05:08.492 --> 05:13.060
And, uh, so I, uh, don't... Don't worry about it.

05:13.080 --> 05:16.465
Uh, so I wrote... I wrote very briefly.

05:17.327 --> 05:19.410
Really comparatively briefly.

05:19.998 --> 05:27.609
A lot of the experiences that people say are too much were one paragraph, one line.

05:27.629 --> 05:30.974
It seemed to me that it was important in my progression.

05:31.014 --> 05:31.775
Thank you.

05:32.116 --> 05:37.964
It's not easy to write about yourself if you come from Boston, I'll tell you that.

05:37.984 --> 05:39.266
It's a good quote, too, isn't it?

05:39.286 --> 05:39.947
I can see that one in time.

05:40.518 --> 05:46.107
You can't write about money, you can't write about sex, you can't write about your family.

05:46.227 --> 05:57.505
And you set off to write about a... If you are living out and you're trimming the edges and riding the tractor, does this agree with you, this kind of a... Oh, yeah.

05:57.525 --> 05:58.126
Love it.

05:58.226 --> 05:59.268
I totally can't.

06:01.431 --> 06:03.194
I've got plenty of stuff.

06:03.715 --> 06:06.559
I hope it's not a big tractor.

06:06.539 --> 06:08.001
It is.

06:08.222 --> 06:11.868
I'm glad it's Flatland.

06:13.451 --> 06:14.592
It's Flatland.

06:16.596 --> 06:19.260
Yeah.

06:19.280 --> 06:23.427
It's a giant.

06:23.447 --> 06:25.691
It doesn't mean anything to me.

06:25.711 --> 06:26.592
It's pretty big.

06:26.953 --> 06:28.716
It's also pretty old, isn't it?

06:28.898 --> 06:30.342
I'll go one quick question.

06:30.402 --> 06:36.437
You mentioned you were about the Kennedy chair at the... And you said it hasn't been filled yet.

06:36.457 --> 06:37.760
Is that a political deal?

06:37.860 --> 06:42.211
Don't get me started on that.

06:42.311 --> 06:44.376
I had this...

06:44.660 --> 06:51.226
that I could repay two very important influences in my life.

06:51.246 --> 06:57.472
One was Kennedy and the other was the Post, which gave me a lot of dough, which gave me access to a lot of dough.

06:57.492 --> 07:01.535
So I thought, how do you do that in one swoop?

07:01.615 --> 07:07.400
Do a chair at the Kennedy School in Journalism and Public Policy.

07:07.641 --> 07:10.223
And so it took me some years to do it.

07:10.283 --> 07:12.805
I couldn't give it a more dough.

07:12.825 --> 07:14.667
And they've had the money for

07:14.647 --> 07:17.751
Eight years?

07:17.771 --> 07:18.772
That's ridiculous.

07:19.273 --> 07:21.055
Eight years?

07:21.136 --> 07:23.999
At least eight years.

07:24.019 --> 07:26.042
Now, do you have veto power?

07:26.142 --> 07:28.686
Do you have veto power?

07:28.966 --> 07:30.168
No, you don't.

07:30.188 --> 07:30.528
No way.

07:30.568 --> 07:35.815
In fact, if you were suggesting that person is dead, they offered it to one person.

07:35.835 --> 07:37.577
My phone was just dreadful.

07:37.597 --> 07:40.401
It would have taken all the joy out of it for me.

07:40.381 --> 07:45.992
And it was a she, and she turned it down.

07:46.894 --> 07:49.840
And it was a she, but she's already gone.

07:49.860 --> 07:53.648
She's the head of a college department.

07:54.229 --> 08:00.381
And you know goddamn well what...

08:01.103 --> 08:04.449
caused them to offer it to her.

08:04.469 --> 08:08.957
I tried to get Kay to do it.

08:08.977 --> 08:11.261
Maybe she'll do it out.

08:11.281 --> 08:15.028
She gave a good bundle of money to holler.

08:15.481 --> 08:16.542
To the Kennedy School?

08:16.643 --> 08:17.564
No, no.

08:17.584 --> 08:21.449
She loves the Kennedy School, as you know.

08:21.469 --> 08:26.997
She gave a bundle to the Kennedy School.

08:27.017 --> 08:27.717
Unattached.

08:27.958 --> 08:29.019
On the what?

08:29.039 --> 08:29.840
Unrestricted.

08:29.860 --> 08:31.102
Unrestricted.

08:31.122 --> 08:31.743
Unrestricted.

08:31.763 --> 08:36.790
So, I said, you hate the Kennedy School.

08:36.970 --> 08:40.775
I said, really, the people you used to get to buy into is the Neiman.

08:41.055 --> 08:42.517
The Neiman, I thought that.

08:42.918 --> 08:45.201
Because college is a high-pring student.

08:45.181 --> 08:51.172
I don't know.

08:51.553 --> 09:08.185
I got a note from Cal who spent a year in Washington.

09:08.519 --> 09:37.092
saying that he's heard that they picked something but it's got to go to the uh faculty committee and i had no idea who it is that pisses me off i don't like it it should actually yeah and then uh you know by god come time to announce that they'll want my ass up there you saw that thing down at yale where the guy gave oh yeah yeah x millions of dollars for western

09:37.561 --> 09:46.230
I think he wanted to approve the list of candidates and they said, no way.

09:46.370 --> 09:49.773
I like the idea of the curriculum, though.

09:50.054 --> 10:05.069
I mean, there was a lot of multicultural criticism of his... Well, they'll let you determine the purpose.

10:05.389 --> 10:05.710
That's right.

10:05.790 --> 10:07.011
There was criticism.

10:07.244 --> 10:09.788
A lot of people said that they didn't want to study Western.

10:09.808 --> 10:13.334
Look at the relationship between the press and the public policy.

10:13.354 --> 10:16.300
That should be pretty easy.

10:16.320 --> 10:17.502
Pretty big barn, isn't it?

10:17.522 --> 10:23.071
You can drive a lot of tractors into that.

10:23.171 --> 10:28.881
Did anyone have as good a time in the newspaper business as you and Wayne Chappelle?

10:28.901 --> 10:32.267
And I don't know the answer to that.

10:32.327 --> 10:32.948
Thanks very much.

10:32.928 --> 10:38.496
You know, people keep asking me whether I wish you were back by Disney.

10:38.516 --> 10:43.663
I keep saying, I think I would if I hadn't had such a good run, if I hadn't enjoyed it.

10:43.824 --> 10:45.646
I would regret it.

10:45.666 --> 10:51.815
You know, you and I were the bright people for the 60s, 70s, 80s.

10:51.835 --> 10:53.758
We're not the right people for the 90s.

10:54.058 --> 10:57.383
I don't think we're smart enough.

10:57.363 --> 11:01.567
Just my name, that's all.

11:01.607 --> 11:02.969
North Grafton.

11:02.989 --> 11:05.211
Yeah, it's right next to Worcester, actually.

11:05.611 --> 11:07.634
It's where the top vet school is.

11:08.354 --> 11:09.275
North Grafton.

11:09.295 --> 11:10.657
North Grafton.

11:10.677 --> 11:11.798
Right next to the vet school.

11:12.298 --> 11:15.341
I have got the vet school, basically, yeah.

11:15.442 --> 11:16.783
It's nice.

11:17.584 --> 11:19.286
How did you settle there?

11:19.306 --> 11:20.887
I came out of the Navy in 71.

11:20.907 --> 11:25.632
Hello.

11:25.983 --> 11:43.992
Wow.

11:44.172 --> 11:52.345
Wow.

11:52.325 --> 12:03.702
I'll walk you that way now.

12:03.722 --> 12:10.873
Okay, buddy.
