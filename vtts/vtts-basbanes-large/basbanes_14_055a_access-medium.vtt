WEBVTT

00:02.562 --> 00:06.608
Mark, kindly pronounce your name for me once more, please.

00:06.628 --> 00:06.728
Sure.

00:06.748 --> 00:07.749
Mark Dimunation.

00:08.110 --> 00:15.060
And just for my own interest, what's the origin of the surname?

00:15.440 --> 00:16.201
Oh, it's Ukrainian.

00:16.341 --> 00:17.163
It's Ukrainian?

00:17.183 --> 00:17.363
Yeah.

00:17.383 --> 00:18.544
Okay.

00:18.564 --> 00:25.795
And we're here in the— We're in the Carl A. Kroc Library, and you're in the Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections.

00:25.975 --> 00:28.198
And you were telling me that your responsibility

00:28.685 --> 00:33.591
responsibilities, embrace all of the... I'm responsible for the printed book collections.

00:34.332 --> 00:34.432
Okay.

00:34.452 --> 00:57.021
But then you also, when I decided to put on a tape recorder, were mentioning that as you put more and more material up on the web... We're discovering that there's a new role as a curator, as a person who's responsible for putting forward materials, which the creation of a website is, in essence, an interpretation, a synthesis of material...

00:57.355 --> 01:06.690
that then is described in a certain way, much more like a textbook, I would think, depending on how you exhibit or how you present as a curator.

01:07.492 --> 01:09.535
Because of the nature of selectivity?

01:10.136 --> 01:18.390
Selectivity, because you're interpreting the material, you're explaining what it is, you're explaining how it links to the other materials that you're also presenting as an image.

01:19.592 --> 01:24.139
It's much less of a stand-back, objective presentation of the material.

01:24.558 --> 01:28.323
And that's particularly the case when you start building websites.

01:30.586 --> 01:36.654
They become illustrated monographs, and it's a very different kind of function.

01:36.674 --> 01:39.317
Websites become illustrated monographs.

01:39.497 --> 01:40.879
That's one way of looking at it.

01:42.081 --> 01:51.493
They're not monographic in one very important way, which is the narrative is easily disruptive, is disrupted, and an individual...

01:51.946 --> 02:07.269
can go in any number of directions, so it's not a linear narrative any longer, and yet you have to build an interpretation that works regardless which path the individual takes as they select certain aspects and move around in the website.

02:07.850 --> 02:14.219
Can you give me an idea of numbers, of what you have under your... In terms of the collection?

02:14.279 --> 02:15.141
Yeah.

02:15.241 --> 02:18.105
The printed book collection now is about 300,000 volumes.

02:19.307 --> 02:21.430
The manuscript collections, which

02:21.882 --> 02:26.466
are under the curatorial control of two people.

02:26.606 --> 02:30.389
There's a curator of manuscripts and the university archivist.

02:30.409 --> 02:33.212
Together they hold about 75 million pieces of paper.

02:33.232 --> 02:36.895
75 million pieces of paper.

02:36.975 --> 02:42.200
And, of course, I'll be talking to the... You'll be talking to Elaine, and she can give you the actual linear footage.

02:43.141 --> 02:51.568
But I'm just curious where you've indicated that Cornell is the leader in...

02:52.190 --> 02:53.192
scanning these things.

02:55.097 --> 03:01.391
Is there an effort, is there a project afoot to digitize everything, all this stuff?

03:01.411 --> 03:05.660
No, I don't think that's a realistic target, I think.

03:05.680 --> 03:08.747
We have over six million volumes here at Cornell.

03:09.217 --> 03:11.480
And it costs approximately $5 a page.

03:12.622 --> 03:14.124
Think of what you're talking about.

03:14.304 --> 03:16.647
And I'm not sure if there's a computer around that.

03:16.667 --> 03:21.134
I know it was a naive question, however, but so then we have to go back to selectivity.

03:21.174 --> 03:21.695
Exactly.

03:21.995 --> 03:23.878
And so how do we decide?

03:24.198 --> 03:24.699
Exactly.

03:24.759 --> 03:30.547
And one of the things that Cornell is certainly one of many institutions that are doing this.

03:30.567 --> 03:37.637
It's just that in terms of the technology or the specifications for digitization, that's been a longstanding process.

03:38.073 --> 03:42.420
concern on the part of the individuals that you'll be meeting tomorrow.

03:43.001 --> 03:44.803
So value judgments are being made.

03:44.823 --> 03:48.469
Precisely, and that's what I'm referring to in a way that we... That's kind of what I'm driving at.

03:48.509 --> 03:51.994
Yeah, and it can be done in a variety of ways.

03:52.475 --> 03:57.483
And several of the projects that you hear about when you talk to Anne will be a clue to that.

03:58.845 --> 04:06.156
One is to cut across discipline for a certain time period as if you're representing a slice of

04:07.452 --> 04:11.038
concerns across various subject matters.

04:11.078 --> 04:22.336
So you look at the 1820s and you include economic material and material about domesticity and the cult of domesticity, and you include architectural plans and newspapers.

04:23.237 --> 04:35.316
Or you can do a genre, as we would call it down here, a genre approach in which you digitize all the abolitionist newspapers, which we're not doing, but it's just an example.

04:35.583 --> 04:37.646
Can you give me an example of something that you are?

04:37.686 --> 04:43.475
Ezra Cornell's papers are being digitized.

04:43.976 --> 04:52.189
There's a project that we participate in with other institutions called Making of America, which Ann Kenney is responsible for.

04:52.890 --> 05:00.882
And that's looking at a certain time period of America, but looking at materials that relate to the building of the infrastructure of the United States.

05:01.587 --> 05:17.321
Some of these are rather specific in terms of engineering, civil engineering, roads, bridges, but also the larger social and possibly political and cultural questions surrounding that, money, finance.

05:17.461 --> 05:29.012
And once the items that you select are scanned and stored in computers, does that

05:29.954 --> 05:33.478
Do you mean that you no longer have access to the scholar?

05:33.498 --> 05:39.864
Is the scholar now using the material off the computer as opposed to the primary?

05:39.904 --> 05:43.488
No, it's never meant to replace the—it depends on what project you're looking at.

05:43.568 --> 05:57.362
Making of America is really looking at cooperative arrangements between institutions, and how do you define your collections, and how do you make them accessible to an audience that goes far beyond your physical territory.

05:57.781 --> 06:07.834
and how do you develop a cooperative working arrangement with other institutions that still recognizes ownership and copyright and all of that sort of thing.

06:07.854 --> 06:21.151
So some of the projects are specifically designed to look at how do we build bases of information that aren't necessarily uniquely tied to a single institution.

06:21.351 --> 06:22.072
How do we share?

06:22.112 --> 06:24.615
The scholar is still welcome here.

06:25.321 --> 06:31.094
In this division, actually our approach to digitization is no different than the card catalog.

06:31.114 --> 06:34.902
It just gives people access and a route to the original object.

06:35.805 --> 06:40.495
It's just that they can do it 24 hours a day as opposed to waiting for the division to be open.

06:40.610 --> 07:09.148
but it's never meant to replace it it's meant instead to give people a variety of ways of access to the material that they wouldn't normally have if you were doing this as a bibliographic description in your view the primary materials are still the sacred objects absolutely and everything we do they're not meant to replace they're really just meant to facilitate and there's a very good example that Elaine will show you tomorrow which is the Feuertes

07:09.449 --> 07:10.551
website.

07:11.051 --> 07:26.734
Fuerides was a naturalist illustrator much in the in a more scientific manner than F-U-E-R-T-E-S Fuerides as opposed to what you would think it is which is Fuerides.

07:26.754 --> 07:30.158
That's why I wanted to kill myself on the transcription of it.

07:30.178 --> 07:32.502
But Elaine will actually show you the site tomorrow.

07:34.725 --> 07:39.051
Much in the vein of Audubon though he's claimed to be more scientific

07:39.470 --> 07:45.577
We have his drawings, his field books, his papers, and his paintings here at Cornell.

07:45.777 --> 07:48.260
All these have been photographed and digitized.

07:49.161 --> 08:02.076
Although we have the Audubon material here, and we have the manuscript collection that deals with the census of Audubons, and we do have an elephant folio here.

08:02.596 --> 08:06.861
But this is a much, much richer archival collection.

08:08.748 --> 08:19.739
Simply digitizing that collection without providing an overlay of access doesn't do much for the person who's working with it.

08:19.759 --> 08:28.587
You have to provide, or at least at a teaching institution, wants to provide an overlay of how do you get at this material, how do you organize it.

08:29.448 --> 08:36.915
So you'll see tomorrow that it's possible on the Furedis site to search by species and families if you want to.

08:37.452 --> 08:43.199
but the initial interface with it is in fact a map of the Harriman expedition in Alaska.

08:44.140 --> 08:47.164
And the route is sketched out for you.

08:47.224 --> 08:51.349
If you click anywhere on the route, it throws you into his journals for that area.

08:51.649 --> 08:53.011
This is all designed here?

08:54.192 --> 08:54.993
Yeah.

08:55.013 --> 09:03.584
Any bird that he mentions in that date, Sitka, sketched the red-blue heron.

09:04.525 --> 09:07.088
If you click on the hot-linked,

09:07.540 --> 09:11.386
name of the bird, it will then show you every drawing he's made of that bird.

09:11.406 --> 09:12.247
We'll see this tomorrow.

09:12.267 --> 09:13.068
You'll see that tomorrow.

09:13.348 --> 09:16.353
And this was designed by engineers?

09:16.373 --> 09:17.314
Did you call them engineers?

09:17.354 --> 09:19.097
What do you call these people?

09:19.518 --> 09:21.040
Well, they're called a number of things.

09:21.140 --> 09:27.810
We have positions here that are, and also up in preservation, that are referred to as digital archivists.

09:28.310 --> 09:28.971
Oh, good.

09:28.991 --> 09:30.814
I like that.

09:31.992 --> 09:34.115
I love your name.

09:34.135 --> 09:37.921
Well, actually, as I'm saying it, it's an interesting title because it's not quite sure.

09:37.941 --> 09:40.044
It implies two different things.

09:41.186 --> 09:44.010
One is an archivist who deals with digital information.

09:44.050 --> 09:47.955
The other is somebody who archives digital information.

09:47.976 --> 09:48.977
They're two different meanings.

09:49.598 --> 09:53.363
And then there are people who are involved in website design.

09:56.308 --> 09:58.371
Usually they're referred to as digital archivists, I think.

09:58.411 --> 09:59.873
You might ask Tom about that.

10:00.005 --> 10:03.168
How long has this program been in place here?

10:03.188 --> 10:05.751
All this stuff.

10:05.771 --> 10:07.853
I'm wondering if it's in Genesis, why Cornell?

10:10.876 --> 10:13.238
Ann would better be able to give you the history of that.

10:13.759 --> 10:16.842
It's been at least the last five years, probably more likely six.

10:16.902 --> 10:17.903
You'll see Ann tomorrow.

10:19.785 --> 10:21.407
Okay, good.

10:21.427 --> 10:27.733
And it started originally with our relationships with certain corporations, Xerox and Kodak.

10:31.797 --> 10:33.960
Which are not far from here, right?

10:34.060 --> 10:35.121
Kodak is not far from here.

10:35.141 --> 10:39.227
They're in Rochester, about two hours away.

10:39.607 --> 10:41.670
And out of Kodak came something called CLIC.

10:43.352 --> 10:47.798
The acronym, I think, means Kodak Library Image something or another.

10:48.299 --> 10:51.383
Tom was the— Of course it makes perfect sense.

10:51.403 --> 10:52.084
I mean, here they are.

10:52.124 --> 10:53.866
And you say, why Stanford?

10:53.906 --> 10:57.952
I mean, they're in the middle of Silicon Valley, you know?

10:57.972 --> 10:58.092
Right.

10:59.185 --> 11:00.807
So, and these projects are very different.

11:00.847 --> 11:07.533
Xerox dealt with how do you take and type and convert it to a digital image?

11:07.833 --> 11:11.116
What kind of specifications do you need in order to digitize a book?

11:13.799 --> 11:22.647
Kodak was interested in digital images, or images being digitized, and how do you make them accessible?

11:25.890 --> 11:28.112
Just, again, a naive question, but

11:30.320 --> 11:32.783
How does all this support the curriculum?

11:33.584 --> 11:36.087
Or is it relevant to the curriculum?

11:36.107 --> 11:37.149
It's actually quite relevant.

11:37.169 --> 11:38.410
There are a couple of projects.

11:38.711 --> 11:40.653
Some of this on Stealing People's Thunder.

11:40.673 --> 11:41.274
That's okay.

11:41.454 --> 11:42.375
I can hear it twice.

11:43.116 --> 11:47.682
An example would be a project that's referred to here as Utopia.

11:49.645 --> 11:53.590
You're also giving me questions to ask people about it.

11:53.850 --> 11:58.656
Utopia is an image database that's been developed on campus.

12:00.357 --> 12:06.763
that deals with all Renaissance images across collections on campus.

12:10.427 --> 12:24.921
Museum, the slide library, the book collections, and they are being cataloged with a variety of keyword access courses, buildings.

12:26.542 --> 12:29.385
So it's possible for our students in the history of art

12:29.804 --> 12:48.371
to go in and pull up thumbnail images and also full-scale JPEG images of materials available on campus, doing the kind of searching that you could never do in a paper environment, that you can't do in traditional computer cataloging.

12:48.872 --> 12:52.517
In fact, it's very hard to do because they're located in four different places.

12:53.058 --> 12:59.187
Now you sit down at a computer and call up all the images of Michelangelo or all of the Durer drawings

12:59.858 --> 13:01.961
and engravings on campus.

13:02.742 --> 13:18.326
Or you can call up all the images of the visitation or the Annunciation or all of the images that have animals in them on campus from the Renaissance.

13:18.346 --> 13:28.161
And it creates an instant gathering of material that students can begin to work with that would really have literally not been possible without that kind of

13:29.052 --> 13:34.358
Do you have a way to measure usage?

13:34.378 --> 13:35.439
It's used in classes.

13:35.499 --> 13:40.605
There are several classes that have assignments specifically geared to utopia.

13:41.707 --> 13:42.287
Utopia.

13:45.531 --> 13:47.974
Anything beyond the obvious reason for naming it?

13:47.994 --> 13:48.815
There's no acronym.

13:48.835 --> 13:54.081
It's just called utopia.

13:54.550 --> 13:58.415
Perhaps it was a reference to our vision.

13:58.655 --> 14:01.098
How long have you been here, Mark?

14:01.198 --> 14:02.420
I've been here almost six years.

14:02.740 --> 14:04.002
I came here from Stanford.

14:04.022 --> 14:04.723
Oh, you did?

14:04.743 --> 14:07.647
So you worked with Keller?

14:08.207 --> 14:09.629
No, Keller came after me.

14:09.749 --> 14:19.161
I was there in the David Weber years, and a man named Street was just stepping in when I left.

14:19.902 --> 14:22.245
You mentioned when we talked on the phone that

14:23.153 --> 14:28.421
You're involved in kind of a consortium with a number of other institutions.

14:29.022 --> 14:29.442
Is that right?

14:30.364 --> 14:31.666
In terms of digital projects?

14:31.726 --> 14:32.707
In terms of digital projects.

14:32.888 --> 14:32.968
Yes.

14:33.108 --> 14:36.353
There are a couple that are going on at the moment.

14:36.453 --> 14:43.143
One is MESL, and that's a combination of museums and libraries across the country.

14:43.163 --> 14:44.125
How do you spell it?

14:44.145 --> 14:45.447
M-E-S-L.

14:45.467 --> 14:48.351
It's an acronym.

14:56.701 --> 14:58.002
I was about to ask you.

14:58.022 --> 14:58.443
Oh.

14:58.463 --> 15:00.244
I love, I mean, I love tons of things.

15:01.025 --> 15:01.125
Yeah.

15:01.145 --> 15:02.146
You mentioned that on the phone.

15:02.766 --> 15:05.269
But it was, there are more than a ton of things.

15:05.289 --> 15:08.071
It's produced from Cornell, so I wanted to get a better sense of it.

15:08.171 --> 15:10.393
I've got my car, so it's not a question of loading one airplane.

15:11.034 --> 15:16.799
Last week was a trip coming back from, I think, John Cole loaded me down last week, too.

15:17.520 --> 15:25.847
Tell me, just to switch, since it was John Linseth who directed me to you, and I'm delighted

15:26.232 --> 15:27.033
that this happened.

15:27.393 --> 15:29.115
Serendipity is just a wonderful thing.

15:30.256 --> 15:30.376
Right.

15:30.396 --> 15:37.022
Can you tell me briefly about John's collection and your hopes for that when it comes here?

15:37.263 --> 15:41.907
Just talk in general a little bit about it and him.

15:41.927 --> 15:44.470
John has a couple of major collections going on.

15:44.530 --> 15:54.079
The Fables collection is his current passion, but he also has quite an impressive Alice collection.

15:55.004 --> 15:57.327
Alison Wonderland collection, Lewis Carroll collection.

15:58.589 --> 16:02.014
The Russian material that he's working on is connected to his fables collection.

16:04.277 --> 16:20.861
He started off in collecting fables, as I understand it, in the more traditional fashion, but has since pushed his collection towards those areas and literatures that aren't necessarily reflected in other fable collections.

16:20.901 --> 16:23.965
And so he's pulling in a lot of Hebraica

16:24.215 --> 16:32.204
and a lot of Russian fables, and he's acquiring illuminated manuscript leaves of Bibles.

16:33.325 --> 16:34.847
They purport to have fables.

16:34.947 --> 16:35.888
Right, right.

16:35.948 --> 16:37.270
He shows a couple of these.

16:37.290 --> 16:39.212
This is his most recent thing.

16:39.713 --> 16:40.233
Interesting.

16:40.974 --> 16:44.258
Yeah, and it's quite an impressive collection.

16:44.278 --> 16:45.880
Did you see it at all when you were at his house?

16:47.462 --> 16:50.625
Selectively.

16:50.765 --> 16:52.247
It's growing into quite a collection.

16:52.919 --> 16:56.504
He's an alum of Cornell and is a great friend of the library.

16:56.564 --> 17:07.758
He was one of the co-directors of the library's part of the capital campaign, which was a five-year campaign in which Cornell raised more money than any other institution in America has ever raised.

17:08.419 --> 17:09.320
It's like $1.5 billion.

17:09.440 --> 17:10.521
Cornell?

17:10.542 --> 17:16.429
Cornell is routinely the highest...

17:19.683 --> 17:22.867
Raises more money than any other institution on an annual basis.

17:23.027 --> 17:23.848
How does that figure?

17:23.868 --> 17:24.529
More than Harvard?

17:25.050 --> 17:25.230
Yes.

17:26.952 --> 17:28.134
That's a surprise.

17:29.335 --> 17:33.340
And this year they just hit a record, which was... I've forgotten the figure.

17:34.422 --> 17:49.521
It has to do with the atmosphere at Cornell, which, while Ivy League is also, because of its remoteness, creates a much tighter community so that alums have a very...

17:49.788 --> 17:51.350
strong connection to Cornell.

17:53.032 --> 17:54.193
That's reflected in giving.

17:55.375 --> 18:00.281
You mentioned, and I didn't know this, that there are actually two elements for Cornell.

18:00.301 --> 18:13.998
I mean, there's the Ivy League private kind of element, and then there's... Well, the whole institution is an Ivy League institution, but there are two aspects to the way in which Cornell is run and administered.

18:14.058 --> 18:17.382
We are both an endowed and a statutory institution.

18:17.902 --> 18:21.266
Which is, I would imagine, unique among the Ivy League.

18:21.286 --> 18:23.569
I don't see—among Ivy League institutions?

18:24.570 --> 18:32.579
I would think so, although I don't know about— You know, if they name one, that seems to come close.

18:32.679 --> 18:38.566
Dartmouth, I was thinking of the ones that are up in the sticks, but they might have something like that.

18:39.988 --> 18:40.809
Can't think of it.

18:41.089 --> 18:43.352
So we're— We're— Yeah.

18:43.585 --> 18:47.569
I think we might be unique in the Ivy League, certainly.

18:47.609 --> 18:49.891
I don't know if we might be unique nationally in terms of that.

18:49.911 --> 18:52.032
We're a land-grant institution.

18:52.473 --> 19:00.140
Some of our money comes from the state of New York and the rest comes from... And that's specifically for agricultural-type things and innovation, the vet school as well.

19:00.180 --> 19:12.951
The vet school, large animal research, agriculture, human ecology, some aspects of sociology and psychology.

19:13.184 --> 19:32.724
There are departments that are in fact half and half, or in some cases duplicated, on campus due to the... certainly there's the ILR, the Industrial Labor Relations, School of Labor Relations, are all statutory.

19:33.044 --> 19:41.773
The endowed is the medical college, the law, architecture,

19:42.023 --> 19:43.965
Actually, it's architecture, art, and planning.

19:44.926 --> 19:47.810
And then arts and sciences.

19:48.631 --> 20:04.849
How would you—I certainly wouldn't want you to compare, you know, your special collections to sisters, Ivy League schools, but maybe you could just characterize your holdings in a general sense.

20:04.869 --> 20:11.457
I mean, you gave me some numbers now—strengths, and what kinds of things are you actively acquiring?

20:11.842 --> 20:19.814
Some of the strengths at Cornell will grow out of the history of its collection, which of course is not unique to most collections, have this beginning.

20:21.637 --> 20:37.782
I would say we have a very solid teaching and instructional and rare book collection across the board, on top of which there are a fairly good number of great strengths, several of which are internationally prominent.

20:38.690 --> 20:43.175
And those partly come from the story of how Cornell's collections were built.

20:43.836 --> 20:56.309
Andrew Dixon White, and I'll give you a booklet about Andrew Dixon White as a book collector, is responsible for some of the major collections that are now great sort of steeples of excellence in terms of the collections.

20:57.911 --> 21:08.663
His interest as a collector centered around the individual in opposition or in confrontation with institutions

21:09.318 --> 21:12.862
grand historical events, the church.

21:14.303 --> 21:32.482
And his collecting interests are reflected now in large sections of the rare book collection that include the French Revolution collection, which is purportedly the largest outside of Paris, and is quite an impressive collection.

21:32.502 --> 21:36.186
I'm sorry, were these through gift or purchase, combination?

21:36.571 --> 21:40.655
Andrew Dixon White gave his collection to Cornell University.

21:40.775 --> 21:45.720
Andrew Dixon White was the first president of Cornell.

21:45.740 --> 22:05.160
It has been layered since then by gifts, significant gifts, to those holdings, added to that French Revolution collection, which began as a documentary-style collection besides the major books.

22:05.765 --> 22:14.134
White was interested in pamphlets, prints, newspapers, some of the fugitive material from the period.

22:15.336 --> 22:18.760
But since then it has been added to by significant gifts.

22:18.800 --> 22:21.242
Lavoisier's papers are at Cornell.

22:21.262 --> 22:23.145
Lafayette's papers are at Cornell.

22:23.205 --> 22:24.486
How did that happen?

22:24.526 --> 22:29.832
They've been acquired through the gifts of friends who've made it possible for them to be purchased.

22:30.318 --> 22:39.188
large segments of books from 18th century France have come in from several other donors that have been added to it because of the initial strength.

22:39.288 --> 22:42.492
But you'd almost think of Lafayette's papers would be in France, wouldn't you?

22:43.133 --> 22:48.699
Well, they were until they came to Cornell.

22:49.460 --> 22:52.123
Cornell acquired... And you just pointed to a portrait of

22:52.829 --> 22:56.392
of one of Lafayette's forerunners.

22:56.413 --> 23:15.331
This is an 18th century portrait of a 15th century relative of Lafayette, the first marshal of France, who's painted in 18th century style, and came from Chavignac, which was Lafayette's estate that Cornell acquired.

23:15.351 --> 23:19.515
There are bits of Lafayette throughout Cornell University.

23:19.555 --> 23:20.716
That's Lafayette's clock.

23:20.756 --> 23:22.498
There's another clock

23:22.951 --> 23:23.712
in the reading room.

23:24.733 --> 23:25.874
So we acquired the estate.

23:25.974 --> 23:30.278
Well, it points to Lafayette's clock in his office.

23:30.298 --> 23:30.498
Very nice.

23:30.518 --> 23:31.399
What kind of clock is it?

23:31.519 --> 23:34.082
Would you just—is there any different clock?

23:34.442 --> 23:38.145
It's a standard gear and spring clock.

23:38.205 --> 23:43.190
What's nice about it is that it has glass on the side so you can see the operation.

23:44.111 --> 23:44.551
Does it work?

23:46.073 --> 23:48.455
I am reluctant to find out.

23:48.475 --> 23:50.477
I don't blame you.

23:50.693 --> 23:56.398
And it's standing on a wood inlaid case that is original to the cloth.

23:56.959 --> 23:57.860
Is it French?

23:57.880 --> 23:58.921
It looks like it should be.

23:58.941 --> 23:59.601
Yes, it is.

24:01.583 --> 24:02.904
Sorry to jump around.

24:03.465 --> 24:05.026
Lavoisier's papers is the same.

24:05.066 --> 24:10.872
So this is a history of the development of certain subject strengths.

24:10.932 --> 24:18.979
Another of the collections that has strong representation in the holdings is the anti-slavery collection.

24:20.157 --> 24:22.981
Andrew Dixon White collected heavily in the Civil War.

24:24.943 --> 24:26.425
He grew up in central New York.

24:29.229 --> 24:40.624
His upbringing included a lot of exposure to abolitionists of the period, the Reverend Samuel May being the most significant for him.

24:41.685 --> 24:48.274
After the war, when Cornell was a young institution,

24:49.942 --> 25:15.932
William Lloyd Garrison, Frederick Douglass, Samuel May, a couple of other abolitionists got together and wrote a circular letter to the friends of the movement telling them that this place called Cornell University was quite wisely documenting the abolitionist movement and would they please send pamphlets and papers and documentation so that this rich tradition can be guaranteed.

25:16.891 --> 25:45.548
So a very early kind of contemporary collecting was going on at Cornell, and out of it is the anti-slavery collection, which includes William Lloyd Garrison's copy of The Liberator, large pamphlet collections from Samuel May, papers from the Freedmen's Association, Lydia Maria Child's papers, all of which pulled together as a very, very strong documentation on the anti-slavery movement.

25:47.148 --> 25:52.876
Andrew Dixon White also collected probably the leading collection on witchcraft, European witchcraft.

25:54.458 --> 25:56.120
And that's a separate collection actually here.

25:58.283 --> 26:10.860
Documenting the religious controversy, the doctrinal controversy, the Inquisition, and demonologists and penologists all the way up to the controversy in England.

26:10.940 --> 26:13.503
It doesn't deal with the United States or the colonies.

26:14.765 --> 26:16.868
In terms of acquisitions, I have

26:17.405 --> 26:20.388
What kinds of things are you buying?

26:20.408 --> 26:26.915
Currently, I do have obligations to continue certain collections given their comprehensiveness.

26:26.995 --> 26:34.122
The Dante and Petrarch collections, both of which were started by Willard Fisk.

26:34.142 --> 26:35.904
That's F-I-S-T-E.

26:37.125 --> 26:40.408
The first university librarian.

26:40.428 --> 26:43.952
And another great book collector from Cornell.

26:44.152 --> 26:47.276
His collecting actually was very different from Andrew Dixon White.

26:47.316 --> 26:53.984
So we have this interesting combination of, on the one hand, an historian's view of collecting.

26:54.024 --> 27:01.233
That's Andrew Dixon White was an historian before he became a university president and before he became a diplomat.

27:01.373 --> 27:09.923
Willard Fiske, on the other hand, collected extremely comprehensively and very much more in the fashion of a bibliophile.

27:11.540 --> 27:19.847
So he collected an extremely significant Dante collection, all editions, all printings.

27:19.867 --> 27:35.160
And the same for Petrarch, which is also here, and the Icelandic collection, the Fisk Icelandic collection, which interestingly, and you'll talk to Tom about this, is the focus of digital activity.

27:36.181 --> 27:41.445
And there's a certain project being developed now that will ultimately lead to

27:41.847 --> 27:45.711
digitizing a good section of the Icelandic national literature.

27:46.572 --> 27:56.022
And this is another version of what Cornell is spending much of its time dealing with, which is how you construct these projects.

27:56.042 --> 28:01.468
You meet with Tom at lunch and then at the end of the day on tomorrow.

28:01.808 --> 28:05.172
Which is how do you develop these kinds of projects.

28:05.973 --> 28:09.897
In this case, it's between a country and a university.

28:11.058 --> 28:19.811
And our collection, the Fisk-Icelandic collection, is probably after Iceland and Copenhagen, certainly the strongest in North America.

28:24.538 --> 28:34.854
So it's an effort between these two entities to come together and create a universe of information that exceeds both of our... And what are the two entities?

28:35.114 --> 28:36.957
Iceland itself.

28:37.398 --> 28:38.479
The country of Iceland, yes.

28:39.200 --> 28:40.322
We are dealing with...

28:41.146 --> 28:46.072
the Minister of Culture and the Ambassador and the National Library.

28:46.412 --> 28:48.595
You're actually going to create something that they don't have.

28:50.678 --> 28:55.664
We'll be creating something that none of us have, which is... Yes, exactly.

28:55.704 --> 28:57.666
Probably both have it, I assume.

28:57.946 --> 29:08.419
And the difference is that Willard, we have very little manuscript material in the Icelandic collection that comes from Willard Fisk's specific notion that you are...

29:08.787 --> 29:12.393
robbing cultural heritage when he removed manuscripts from the country.

29:12.573 --> 29:15.838
So he never collected manuscripts when he collected Icelandic material.

29:15.858 --> 29:16.820
Really?

29:16.840 --> 29:17.781
Did he articulate it?

29:17.801 --> 29:17.921
Yes.

29:19.864 --> 29:20.966
This was Fisk.

29:20.986 --> 29:21.207
Yes.

29:22.208 --> 29:26.575
So Fisk is Dante, Petrarch, and Iceland, or the Icelandic collection.

29:26.835 --> 29:28.037
I could say Dante and Petrarch.

29:28.057 --> 29:29.440
I don't see how he got interested.

29:29.460 --> 29:34.828
Well, it's a variety of stories behind it.

29:39.803 --> 29:55.241
Some of his interest had to do with language and saga, and Iceland is a perfect example of an island nation whose language is locked within a certain period of time, free of the more Teutonic influences that you find in Europe.

29:56.923 --> 30:05.574
He's the first collector I've ever heard of, ethically opposed to acquiring manuscripts from a country.

30:05.594 --> 30:08.477
I mean, usually they could care less.

30:09.301 --> 30:11.385
driven to acquire the material.

30:12.347 --> 30:16.857
I've never heard of a collector who was so highly ethical about it.

30:17.538 --> 30:21.346
He is highly revered in Iceland, Willard Fisk is.

30:22.288 --> 30:25.875
He's on a postage stamp as a collector, yes.

30:26.260 --> 30:27.382
As a collector?

30:27.522 --> 30:31.549
Well, as an individual he is recognized.

30:31.569 --> 30:38.902
I should make sure that you talk to Patrick Stevens, who is the curator of the Fisk Icelandic Collection.

30:41.227 --> 30:41.748
Okay.

30:42.449 --> 30:46.636
But well recognized in Iceland as an important individual.

30:46.736 --> 30:48.319
What were his approximate years?

30:48.800 --> 30:49.802
Willard Fisk?

30:49.822 --> 30:49.922
Yeah.

30:51.438 --> 31:01.331
Well, he's contemporary to Andrew Dixon White, so it's the late 19th, early 20th century.

31:01.391 --> 31:03.053
Actually, mid-19th.

31:03.173 --> 31:04.675
When the stuff was readily available.

31:04.695 --> 31:05.616
Right, right.

31:06.617 --> 31:09.801
And he could have acquired the manuscripts, probably.

31:10.001 --> 31:16.350
I suspect so, but he specifically avoided them.

31:17.771 --> 31:19.133
Yes, it is unusual.

31:19.585 --> 31:27.233
It also explains why a good deal of his money wasn't spent on acquiring leaves of Dante manuscripts, for example.

31:27.293 --> 31:34.842
He spent his time acquiring the printed Dante and the printed Petrarch, although we do have a few manuscripts.

31:35.262 --> 31:37.685
So he seems to be a little bit more specific about Iceland.

31:37.965 --> 31:40.748
He had left of a reserve about Western Europe for some reason.

31:43.110 --> 31:46.554
So those are also collections that are of great strength.

31:46.574 --> 31:49.137
The history of science collections have their own story

31:49.454 --> 31:53.579
Cornell has strength in ornithology and a variety of natural history.

31:54.320 --> 31:59.247
The medical collections are actually in New York, where Cornell Medical School is in New York City.

32:01.550 --> 32:07.378
Do you have jurisdiction over any of the New York City materials?

32:07.498 --> 32:16.189
It is part of the university library, but I don't have jurisdiction over the rare materials that are there, no, other than as a sort of colleague.

32:17.551 --> 32:18.432
That's irrelevant.

32:18.749 --> 32:31.962
But it does explain the nature or the lacunae in the history of science collections here, since that topic is not collected on this campus because we've collected in the United States.

32:31.982 --> 32:36.667
I have a hard time seeing how anybody could have bad feelings about this stuff, you know?

32:36.687 --> 32:44.835
I mean, regardless of where your attitude is about books and libraries of the future and— Bad feelings about what stuff?

32:45.076 --> 32:47.338
About digital technology?

32:47.791 --> 33:06.578
I think if it's held up as a panacea of some kind, or if it's held up as a solution, or as some educators and administrators have said, this is, you know, why build more buildings because everything's going to be digitized in ten years, so this space is no longer a concern.

33:07.119 --> 33:07.920
Right, right.

33:09.402 --> 33:11.605
Then I can see why people would be uncomfortable with it.

33:11.753 --> 33:19.244
Cornell has just developed an approach to it that sees it as a tool to getting you back to the original materials.

33:19.765 --> 33:22.329
So we incorporate it into our classroom presentations.

33:23.691 --> 33:24.392
That's done here.

33:24.432 --> 33:26.455
That's done in the reference department at Cornell.

33:28.017 --> 33:33.505
They build websites for individual classes now at Cornell so that all the information and all the links are put up.

33:35.688 --> 33:38.993
Are these readily accessed over the Internet?

33:39.412 --> 33:39.752
Yes.

33:40.053 --> 33:42.395
I can punch into these things on my computer?

33:42.415 --> 33:43.176
Yes, to the website.

33:44.037 --> 33:47.681
To the library website, and then you can go down into the Divisions website.

33:48.282 --> 33:49.303
You can look at exhibits.

33:49.363 --> 33:52.307
The exhibit that's up right now is also on the web, for example.

33:57.232 --> 34:00.576
What's your policy on deaccessioning things?

34:00.596 --> 34:01.617
Are you deaccessioning things?

34:01.637 --> 34:02.778
From the book collections?

34:03.519 --> 34:03.740
Yeah.

34:04.240 --> 34:05.942
We do not deaccession...

34:12.706 --> 34:19.712
We have duplicates, but I don't deaccession materials that are unique to the collections.

34:21.214 --> 34:27.099
There are gifts that come in that duplicate the holdings, general duplicates.

34:27.880 --> 34:40.992
If we're not in a field or a period of time in which valiant is an important question, which in this collection would be early printing or certain aspects of literature,

34:42.406 --> 34:45.409
then I'll swap for better copy.

34:45.850 --> 34:46.991
Those duplicates are sold.

34:47.752 --> 34:50.775
But I've been here six years, and we've yet to sell them.

34:52.176 --> 34:56.761
So you leave that open as an option that you have yet to exercise.

34:57.021 --> 34:57.682
Right, right.

34:57.762 --> 35:03.268
We do not have copy 12 of certain things, except in things like the Wordsworth collection.

35:03.868 --> 35:07.232
We have Wordsworth manuscripts here, the ones that are not at Dove's Cottage.

35:08.022 --> 35:13.308
And we have a relationship, actually, with Dove's Cottage, so that we have copies of each other's manuscripts.

35:13.328 --> 35:20.156
The Wordsworth Collection has multiple imprints, but they're really not duplicates.

35:20.196 --> 35:21.718
They're really issue-state variants.

35:23.520 --> 35:30.187
The George Bernard Shaw papers are here, and the Shaw Book Collection also has large numbers of duplicate copies for the same reason.

35:31.829 --> 35:36.915
But in general, this is a teaching and research-oriented collection.

35:37.722 --> 35:44.933
and so we will select materials out based on that.

35:46.716 --> 35:56.871
But we don't have subject limits because we are a research library, so I don't deaccession materials because the topic is no longer of interest or that sort of thing.

35:58.153 --> 36:00.256
So my collecting area is pretty broad.

36:00.737 --> 36:02.700
So if the hook is to say, well,

36:03.423 --> 36:06.787
Somebody gives you a great collection of Alice in Wonderland books, for instance.

36:07.188 --> 36:08.109
This is just an example.

36:08.850 --> 36:13.696
And there's no course that teaches Alice in Wonderland here, let's say.

36:14.216 --> 36:19.403
I'm really not trying to make an example of John's books, but I'm just throwing that out as a... Oh, here's Tom.

36:20.805 --> 36:22.887
This is Thomas Hickerson, the director of the division.

36:22.947 --> 36:24.449
This is Nicholas Basbane.

36:24.830 --> 36:26.872
Good to meet you.

36:27.173 --> 36:31.438
We'll have plenty of opportunity to talk later behind this one to...

36:31.992 --> 36:33.534
stop by and welcome you.

36:33.554 --> 36:34.035
Thank you.

36:34.115 --> 36:35.837
It's a pleasure to be here.

36:35.857 --> 36:38.641
Mark is doing a very thorough introduction.

36:39.943 --> 36:45.891
I have him totally confused at this point, so you can clarify.

36:46.172 --> 36:47.914
You can be the voice of clarity, Tom.

36:47.934 --> 36:49.416
I've set you up well.

36:50.077 --> 36:54.223
Well, I try to seize those opportunities.

36:54.403 --> 36:58.769
That wouldn't be an occasion to say, well, gee, we have no use for this stuff.

36:59.690 --> 37:01.813
Let's swap it for something else that might be more

37:02.485 --> 37:11.056
I think the fact that it's hard to think of a topic where we would say that to somebody is probably an indication.

37:11.076 --> 37:23.551
Well, I mean, I've heard it said, you know, Howard Gottlieb at Boston University said, well, generally speaking, the rule is it has to in some way support the curriculum, you know, material that you require.

37:24.792 --> 37:26.695
This is a good example at Cornell.

37:27.035 --> 37:30.940
We have probably the preeminent Dante collection in North America.

37:32.118 --> 37:36.002
Stanford probably at this point now having the second largest collection.

37:36.883 --> 37:42.850
And depending on what decade you're looking at Cornell, there are no Dantesca scholars.

37:46.034 --> 37:52.001
Would that lead one to the accession of the collection because it doesn't support the curriculum?

37:52.541 --> 37:55.845
One of the great strengths of Cornell University.

37:56.206 --> 38:01.872
So I don't view my collecting for program in that vein.

38:02.324 --> 38:05.547
And it's now being well served.

38:05.667 --> 38:22.901
I think the recent trends in literary theory and what people were referring to as the new historicism opens up an entirely different use of rare materials or special collections materials that one would not have been able to forecast 15 years ago.

38:23.442 --> 38:31.909
Materials that we would have seen as mere examples of popular literature are now, of course, perfect examples of reception of text

38:32.581 --> 38:39.190
cultural transmission of text over time, the filtering down of texts.

38:39.610 --> 38:47.321
And these materials, which may not have supported the formal academic program, are now exactly the evidence that researchers would use.

38:47.441 --> 38:51.166
And it would have been a real crime had they been, a real shame had they been deaccessioned.

38:51.586 --> 38:54.610
So there's really no policy here for removing.

38:54.671 --> 38:59.517
We're building a collection, not paring it down.

39:00.695 --> 39:04.641
There are also materials that come to light when other materials are brought in.

39:05.242 --> 39:24.091
An example of which is that in this division we are also, down the hall from me is the curator of the Human Sexuality Collection, which is largely an archival collection, documents cultural and the social and cultural politics of sexuality.

39:25.573 --> 39:27.917
Started with a gift of papers from

39:28.505 --> 39:46.967
David Goodstein, who was the publisher of The Advocate, it brought in other large organizations, includes thousands of magazines and videotapes and pulp fiction, but also includes archives of political organizations.

39:49.390 --> 39:50.131
Pulp paperbacks.

39:50.311 --> 39:51.893
We're talking pornography?

39:51.913 --> 39:55.457
Some of it's pornography, some of it's softcore.

39:56.230 --> 40:04.499
But the introduction of that material into the collection now gives a completely different view to late 19th century English holdings.

40:05.440 --> 40:23.520
And it prompts one to go back and make sure that sexologists have been documented properly, that the links between the decadence movement through the 20s in America through the late 20th century is now a linkage in the collection that you wouldn't have seen without this material.

40:23.922 --> 40:29.608
some of those materials were here, even though they might have seemed extraneous to a formal academic program.

40:29.708 --> 40:30.969
Who acquired them?

40:33.392 --> 40:35.134
The materials that were already here?

40:35.534 --> 40:41.861
Some of them are incidental sidelines to more traditional canonical authors.

40:42.421 --> 40:51.651
Some of them come in because they're part of a small series of chapbooks, because they were printed by Virginia Woolf, or

40:52.627 --> 40:58.552
because they've come in with other people's papers, because they've come in with libraries.

40:59.052 --> 41:01.895
So they've been culled and assembled in a collection.

41:01.915 --> 41:04.477
And are sitting on the shelf and waiting for a connection to them.

41:06.299 --> 41:07.239
Are they used?

41:08.080 --> 41:08.420
Oh, yes.

41:09.081 --> 41:16.487
It's a very heavily used collection, all total, and especially at Cornell with an extremely strong English department.

41:18.489 --> 41:21.992
Certainly one of the better-ranked ones in the country, if not the rank.

41:22.597 --> 41:25.541
Shakespeare is still required in the English department?

41:26.702 --> 41:28.705
There are certainly a good number of Shakespeare courses.

41:28.765 --> 41:30.908
I'm doing a presentation for one of them next week.

41:31.809 --> 41:35.854
I just thought, I did interview with Scott Turow last week.

41:36.795 --> 41:37.917
I certainly have the new book.

41:38.578 --> 41:40.320
I haven't... The Highbrow Lowbrow?

41:40.841 --> 41:43.044
Exactly, yeah.

41:43.765 --> 41:47.990
I have actually seriously thought about getting in touch.

41:48.010 --> 41:49.913
He's out of Berkeley, I think, right?

41:50.033 --> 41:50.593
He was at Berkeley.

41:50.613 --> 41:51.034
He was

41:51.385 --> 41:54.629
George Mason is where he is now.

41:54.649 --> 41:56.171
Yes, he's no longer at Berkeley.

41:56.271 --> 41:57.533
He's on the East Coast.

41:57.553 --> 41:59.315
He moved over when he won the MacArthur.

41:59.375 --> 41:59.616
Right.

41:59.636 --> 42:04.522
I think he then went back, but I saw him recently attributed to be someplace else as well, not Berkeley.

42:04.542 --> 42:07.285
I think he was in Virginia someplace.

42:08.006 --> 42:08.146
Yeah.

42:08.166 --> 42:09.168
He was closing the store.

42:10.369 --> 42:14.895
Well, yeah, and it's been about six, seven, eight years.

42:15.466 --> 42:17.208
I can't believe I agree with it.

42:17.789 --> 42:24.419
Well, it's sort of the beginning of this interest in readership and reception and transmission in a very different way.

42:28.544 --> 42:34.513
So I don't know if Shakespeare is required, but it's certainly, there are a number of courses that... And I'm sure that I should... Right.

42:34.713 --> 42:36.856
There's certainly a number of courses that continue to use it.

42:37.016 --> 42:44.747
Now, how it uses Shakespeare may vary, but that's... That's something I could address to the English departments for my perspective.

42:45.385 --> 43:05.162
When you mentioned, you know, the new historicism and other such movements, are you influenced by these critical movements in terms of acquisition and acquiring things?

43:05.182 --> 43:10.467
Since one of my primary charges is to build a collection that supports the academic program, yes.

43:11.728 --> 43:13.890
The difficulty in our work is

43:14.242 --> 43:24.717
is keeping a constant thread going so that you're not developing a collection that is a roadmap of fads that start and stop along the way.

43:24.777 --> 43:25.418
Has that happened?

43:25.918 --> 43:26.719
It can happen.

43:26.739 --> 43:35.231
It hasn't yet, in my mind, in terms of the collections, because we're adding to certain strengths already.

43:35.532 --> 43:36.553
So, for example...

43:36.854 --> 43:57.394
Most of my 19th century literature collecting now, some of this is rather obvious and routine for most institutions, is that I'm looking at second-rung authors in Victorian literature, largely women, and that I'm collecting them in a variety of editions so that people can see how that text filters down to a popular reading audience.

43:58.515 --> 44:02.099
Any authors come reading them tonight?

44:02.119 --> 44:04.161
Well, it's a large number of...

44:04.428 --> 44:19.906
of Victorian women authors in particular, some of whom are only one or two book authors, Bithya Croker, who also neatly ties into an interest at Cornell, which is post-colonialism and literature.

44:20.987 --> 44:26.153
How do these authors and these books come to your attention?

44:26.173 --> 44:28.035
From the faculty?

44:28.115 --> 44:33.321
From, in large, at least in part, through the fact that we are

44:33.554 --> 44:40.342
as a division, extremely involved, heavily involved with instruction and teaching on campus.

44:40.943 --> 44:48.673
We do a large number of presentations for courses on campus, well over a hundred a year.

44:48.933 --> 44:49.594
No kidding?

44:49.614 --> 44:50.195
Yeah.

44:50.215 --> 44:52.197
So you just mentioned you're doing something for Shakespeare.

44:52.838 --> 44:53.138
Of course.

44:53.939 --> 44:58.545
And this is more than half of our readership here is undergraduates.

44:59.626 --> 45:01.869
So such a presentation will be what?

45:01.889 --> 45:03.291
You'll have slides of

45:03.659 --> 45:33.413
no no no we bring them into the we bring them into the seminar room yeah and it's content oriented often times it is not a dog and pony in the sense that I don't spend when I'm dealing with Arthurian legend I don't spend a lot of time talking about Caxton other than to identify him as a printer but instead talk about how this particular piece fits into the larger arc of how that literature has been subject to cultural change and political nuance

45:33.815 --> 45:40.803
and how representation of Arthur over time can be seen by looking at original materials from different contexts.

45:41.103 --> 45:43.506
And those presentations go on here quite regularly.

45:43.526 --> 45:46.069
And you have the books for Arthur.

45:46.609 --> 45:46.830
Yes.

45:46.970 --> 45:49.312
Just to continue that example.

45:49.332 --> 45:58.683
So I start with, in this case, I started with secular medieval manuscripts, so we can talk about how text is... Which you have.

45:58.803 --> 45:59.704
Yes, which we have.

46:00.072 --> 46:16.010
I'll move into the introduction of printing and Western culture so that we can then look at the early editions of Arthurian legend, Chaucer, and then follow it through time in various renditions so that we can look at illustrations.

46:16.050 --> 46:25.000
You can look at how the language changes so that their paperbacks are the culmination of a very long story so that when they leave this room,

46:25.452 --> 46:31.140
And they'll have a sense of what it looked like at a particular period of time and its context.

46:32.021 --> 46:34.244
We do a lot of freshman writing programs here.

46:34.304 --> 46:41.293
Cornell is one of those institutions that has a mandatory writing program for all incoming students.

46:42.114 --> 46:51.767
And it's a subject-oriented device so that students are gathered together, you read within a common subject matter, and then you write based on that.

46:52.247 --> 46:54.210
And we do presentations for them

46:54.477 --> 46:57.941
Now, when you say we, you mean the rare books division.

46:57.981 --> 47:05.248
Well, the division here includes rare books, manuscripts, history of science, the Icelandic collection, human sexualities.

47:05.268 --> 47:06.970
It is interesting.

47:07.911 --> 47:16.000
Maybe it happens elsewhere, but I've not heard of it, where the rare books usually are quite apart from the undergraduate experience.

47:16.020 --> 47:19.403
Oh, I think it is certainly a primary focus here.

47:19.743 --> 47:22.206
We might be more ambitious.

47:22.388 --> 47:24.170
about it than other institutions.

47:24.550 --> 47:32.720
So you really do encourage the undergraduate to come and... We're trying to place ourselves as the central part of the library for undergraduate and graduate education.

47:33.280 --> 47:33.961
See, that's wonderful.

47:35.062 --> 47:37.465
And much of our work is geared toward that.

47:37.505 --> 47:39.447
And where does this originate from?

47:40.508 --> 47:44.993
It came partly out of the merger of this division.

47:45.033 --> 47:50.860
The Division of Rare Manuscript Collections grew up out of four separate departments.

47:51.278 --> 47:54.903
I came to Cornell as the head of the department of rare books.

47:56.345 --> 48:03.215
The other three were archives and manuscripts, but literary and medieval manuscripts were always in rare books.

48:03.856 --> 48:17.936
The history of science collections, which grew out of the specifications of the particular donor in which the history of science materials were pulled out of the rare book collection and they created their own history of science collection and the Icelandic collection.

48:18.937 --> 48:20.239
We pulled all of them together

48:20.894 --> 48:22.296
We restructured.

48:22.577 --> 48:24.240
When this building was built, we moved in.

48:25.602 --> 48:28.147
And our approach has changed fairly significantly.

48:28.607 --> 48:35.960
The building was designed to allow us to be an active member of the teaching community.

48:37.643 --> 48:39.326
And we built our programs around that.

48:40.348 --> 48:46.378
So public services and public access is probably the primary preoccupation of people in this division.

48:48.097 --> 48:49.158
Were you going to show me something?

48:49.179 --> 48:52.083
Yes, I want to take you to the vault, actually, so you have a chance to see the building.

48:52.824 --> 48:53.565
We're in a rear book.

48:53.785 --> 48:55.007
What do we call this, the rear book room?

48:55.027 --> 48:55.287
Vault.

48:55.347 --> 48:55.848
Vault.

48:56.329 --> 48:59.753
And you're saying that you see... It's actually a vault for a manuscript.

48:59.974 --> 49:00.194
Okay.

49:00.214 --> 49:02.557
And you said you shelve according to size.

49:02.577 --> 49:02.858
Right.

49:02.878 --> 49:06.343
And we have five shelving locations, size locations for books.

49:06.363 --> 49:09.147
Tiny, which is less than 16 centimeters.

49:09.968 --> 49:13.673
A regular, which is in quarto.

49:14.815 --> 49:15.015
Um...

49:15.282 --> 49:18.848
single plus, double plus, triple plus, quadruple plus.

49:18.868 --> 49:20.310
Are they shelved by subject?

49:20.691 --> 49:29.825
They're shelved according to the Library of Congress classification, but there are collections that are shelved independent of the general rare book collection.

49:31.107 --> 49:41.323
They're often referred to as the special collections, and that includes the Dante, the Petrarch, the Shaw, the Witchcraft, and the Wordsworth collections, History of Science,

49:41.624 --> 49:45.930
also has a general history of science collection, but there are several named collections.

49:46.571 --> 49:48.794
Those are mostly due to donor specifications.

49:49.354 --> 49:54.561
The Hill Collection, the same hill that you find in San Diego, for example.

49:55.563 --> 49:59.889
The Adelman Collection, a couple of others in the history of science as well.

49:59.909 --> 50:08.560
So it's a fairly complicated vault, five different shelving locations for each possible named collection.

50:08.700 --> 50:10.703
And you were saying before I put on the machine that

50:12.472 --> 50:25.092
The nature of these stacks is such that you know it's— One would have thought when we left the old rare book vault, you're used to being able to locate material by walking up and down the aisle and just spotting books.

50:25.333 --> 50:35.169
And there was some fear on my part, although I understood the advantage of going to compact shelving, but just sort of a cultural familiarity.

50:35.189 --> 50:37.973
I was afraid of not being able to see my books.

50:38.273 --> 50:41.858
But we don't allow browsing in the rare bunglebee.

50:41.958 --> 50:43.120
No, it makes perfect sense.

50:43.140 --> 50:46.885
It's just for the staff in terms of whether they were happy with it or not.

50:47.306 --> 50:50.790
But actually what it's led to is a much greater familiarity of the collections.

50:50.911 --> 51:03.929
And if you watch people paging books for classes, for example, they're punching buttons with the same kind of knowledge about what aisle to go into as if the aisles were open.

51:04.329 --> 51:07.774
So you actually have a much better sense of your collections even though you can't see the books.

51:08.395 --> 51:13.081
in a much more... But to get in here, you have everything... These are in stations.

51:13.141 --> 51:14.483
There are fixed shelves.

51:14.563 --> 51:16.065
This is fully computerized.

51:16.165 --> 51:18.408
And in between are about eight or nine units.

51:18.428 --> 51:33.408
And so to move them... So it's possible to run eight different aisles at the same time.

51:33.428 --> 51:35.470
Are these designed for Cornell?

51:35.631 --> 51:36.732
These are...

51:37.049 --> 51:41.155
They were modified for Cornell to meet our shelving specifications.

51:41.175 --> 51:43.619
So these are items that are available.

51:43.939 --> 51:44.180
Yes.

51:44.280 --> 51:48.967
This is Montel Shelving, which is a French-Canadian firm.

51:48.987 --> 51:50.570
We're French firm.

51:50.590 --> 51:52.813
I think French-Canadian.

51:54.976 --> 51:56.719
We've had no problems with it whatsoever.

51:56.779 --> 51:57.480
It's smooth.

51:57.560 --> 51:58.361
It doesn't lurch.

52:00.144 --> 52:00.645
It's beautiful.

52:00.825 --> 52:02.668
It reacts when you want it to.

52:02.935 --> 52:11.345
It has a built-in feature at the end of the day in which all the shelves move apart equidistant from each other so that everything can breathe overnight, so they're not locked away.

52:11.365 --> 52:12.606
And that's done automatically.

52:12.626 --> 52:14.689
That's done automatically.

52:14.709 --> 52:19.575
And it allows a very immediate access to the collection.

52:20.255 --> 52:23.019
Remember all these big folios standing?

52:23.039 --> 52:23.960
Yeah, yeah.

52:23.980 --> 52:29.446
The flat folios are shelved in the fixed shelving units where the motor is actually.

52:29.466 --> 52:30.968
Do you have any pictures of this stuff?

52:31.133 --> 52:33.957
Actually, there's a photograph in the brochure, I think.

52:34.658 --> 52:35.700
Quite a nice contrast.

52:36.020 --> 52:39.285
I'm sure there are incunables in here.

52:39.325 --> 52:41.448
Yeah, there are incunables everywhere here.

52:41.989 --> 52:53.186
Actually, what is going on here that these are all... This is probably part of... Yes, this is part of the French Revolution project, which also included conservation of all the materials.

52:53.366 --> 53:00.617
So part of going through the French Revolution collection was to take all the freestanding pamphlets that are scattered about

53:01.120 --> 53:16.559
deacidify them, put them into passive bindings, retaining the original sewing, so if it's stab sewn, we retain it, and redoing the bindings.

53:16.679 --> 53:17.881
All this work is done here?

53:17.901 --> 53:19.763
All this work is done by John Dean's operation.

53:19.823 --> 53:22.226
That's quite impressive.

53:22.246 --> 53:24.169
It's worthy of a fine bindery, isn't it?

53:24.689 --> 53:26.451
And these are cranked.

53:26.471 --> 53:28.234
Cranked out downstairs.

53:28.594 --> 53:29.355
Just cranked out.

53:29.572 --> 53:36.121
And those poor kids did 18,000 French pamphlets all in those pale blue papers.

53:36.141 --> 53:37.783
I'm sure they're quite sick of that color by now.

53:38.845 --> 53:41.829
But, you know, I'm quite lucky as a curator.

53:41.849 --> 53:46.255
It's unusual to find a rare book vault that can look like this consistently.

53:47.697 --> 53:49.780
It's so immaculate, too, I have to say.

53:49.800 --> 53:55.308
Well, that's one of my particular things.

53:55.328 --> 53:55.528
All right.

53:57.162 --> 54:02.910
I saw the collections run all the way down to about the middle of the vault.

54:03.711 --> 54:06.615
And you told me earlier how many printed books you have?

54:06.635 --> 54:08.237
About 300,000 printed volumes.

54:08.257 --> 54:09.679
And they're largely all down here?

54:10.080 --> 54:13.204
All the printed collections are in the vault.

54:13.224 --> 54:13.445
Right here.

54:13.465 --> 54:19.373
A good portion of the archival collections are in remote storage, those that are lesser used.

54:21.412 --> 54:30.267
The advantage also of coming into the building is you can design your shelving to meet your needs, so the Audubon has its own shelving.

54:30.287 --> 54:33.673
These are the Audubon's four volumes.

54:34.654 --> 54:39.683
And this is all part of the Hill collection, the Ornithology collection.

54:39.703 --> 54:40.344
Whose was this?

54:40.384 --> 54:42.387
This must have come as a gift at some point.

54:42.467 --> 54:43.088
Yes, it did.

54:45.172 --> 54:47.115
That's all right.

54:47.956 --> 54:49.539
I better verify that.

54:49.639 --> 54:51.784
They didn't belong to me when I first came here.

54:51.804 --> 54:54.769
They've come to me from the History of Science collection.

54:55.070 --> 54:56.332
Ah, well.

54:56.393 --> 54:57.555
Someone who speaks better of it.

54:58.757 --> 55:01.923
We're looking at several million dollars' worth of books, easily.

55:02.184 --> 55:02.424
Here?

55:02.725 --> 55:03.587
No, just those four.

55:03.747 --> 55:04.288
Just those four.

55:04.328 --> 55:05.530
I was going to say, this wall.

55:05.551 --> 55:06.613
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

55:06.633 --> 55:07.855
Just those four, I mean.

55:08.240 --> 55:09.782
No, no, no.

55:09.862 --> 55:16.109
I was talking about one, two, three, four, five.

55:16.469 --> 55:17.410
Yeah.

55:17.430 --> 55:22.215
When we want to expand, this is apropos of the accessioning question.

55:22.556 --> 55:24.298
This is the sort of dead poet's corner.

55:24.358 --> 55:34.409
This will give you a sense of, I think we probably have now the world's largest collection of Lafayette busts.

55:34.429 --> 55:35.530
All lying...

55:36.758 --> 55:38.219
supine on the shelves.

55:38.620 --> 55:41.182
We're in the middle of an NEH project on Icelandic.

55:41.282 --> 55:46.347
We're converting an old classification scheme to a new one and putting them online.

55:46.387 --> 55:56.938
This is as a prelude to the digital project that Saganet, that we were developing, and so this is part of that project going on right now as we speak.

55:57.939 --> 55:59.380
No, no, you're fine.

55:59.520 --> 55:59.961
You're fine.

56:00.301 --> 56:01.942
Asia Rare is also shoved down here.

56:01.982 --> 56:06.647
One of the necessities of

56:06.863 --> 56:13.610
Moving was to create an arrangement of manuscripts where everything was numbered and rare.

56:15.132 --> 56:15.673
Barcoded.

56:15.953 --> 56:23.722
Barcoded for circulation with an inventory location as well so that we know where they sit on the shelf at all times.

56:23.742 --> 56:29.648
Kroc Library, file 224, face number A, shelf number three, position A.

56:31.670 --> 56:39.700
I've actually devised a shelving system dissimilar to that for my own books at home because I have books in them.

56:39.720 --> 56:41.462
It's actually a very old English system.

56:41.482 --> 56:42.183
Well, it works.

56:42.203 --> 56:43.605
Yeah, you just call it something.

56:43.945 --> 56:49.452
Downstairs Library, Case 1, Shelp 3.

56:49.952 --> 56:53.897
It's no different than working in any of the reference rooms in Oxford.

56:53.917 --> 56:54.618
We're all based on that.

56:54.638 --> 56:56.580
Look at all the Lafayette stuff.

56:56.600 --> 56:58.423
Lafayette is a very interesting story.

56:58.443 --> 56:58.723
That's huge.

56:58.940 --> 57:01.423
The Joyce collection is equally impressive that way.

57:02.364 --> 57:06.850
Tom Staley would love to have that, wouldn't he?

57:06.870 --> 57:08.432
I'm not sure.

57:08.452 --> 57:12.017
I haven't asked him that.

57:12.037 --> 57:13.299
I'm sure he would.

57:13.879 --> 57:15.121
I'm just teasing.

57:15.501 --> 57:17.144
Anything, Joyce, you can just assume.

57:18.786 --> 57:27.597
You count up a number of people who own notebooks from the first draft of Ulysses, which Cornell has, but there are other institutions that have them as well.

57:27.982 --> 57:29.924
This would be one interesting jigsaw puzzle.

57:29.944 --> 57:36.070
And in fact, I think this would be ultimately, this would be the penultimate digital project.

57:36.210 --> 57:42.476
Get all these institutions to agree that we will all digitize our Joyce notebooks and put them up as a single publication on the web.

57:43.557 --> 57:47.481
Now, why do you think they would not agree to... No, because they're such prized possessions.

57:47.701 --> 57:49.623
We spent a lot of... In Texas in particular.

57:49.663 --> 57:51.224
In Texas in particular, exactly.

57:51.825 --> 57:54.107
I mean, anyway, the literature Xerox or...

57:54.526 --> 57:58.070
We're not based on that model.

57:58.471 --> 58:02.336
We do the photocopying for people that we do photocopy.

58:02.356 --> 58:09.605
We're really much more involved, I think, in a research and instructional mode than other institutions will be.

58:10.225 --> 58:14.050
We're fairly generous with the materials, too, within the reason of conservation.

58:14.751 --> 58:22.761
You can tell when we move into the archival section that the shelving changes to four-posts as opposed to cantilever, and it's designed to accommodate

58:23.348 --> 58:25.030
through boxes across.

58:26.712 --> 58:30.597
The same compact shelving that's now moving tons of paper.

58:31.138 --> 58:32.239
It's very impressive.

58:32.760 --> 58:33.821
And they just glide along.

58:35.143 --> 58:37.706
Have you seen the Harvard Depository setup?

58:37.766 --> 58:43.814
We're actually, the remote storage thing, we're mimicking that here at Cornell, the one with the huge tower.

58:44.735 --> 58:47.719
They're currently breaking ground for that right now.

58:47.759 --> 58:51.043
The next remote storage is based on that same system here.

58:51.665 --> 59:00.236
and is being built to environmental specifications for rare books and manuscripts, so we can send materials there.

59:00.656 --> 59:07.104
The goal so far has been not to let the books go out, because archival materials tend to travel a little bit more safely.

59:07.124 --> 59:11.009
And Harvard does keep its archival stuff at the outside.

59:11.049 --> 59:12.571
So ours has been based on usage.

59:12.651 --> 59:16.796
If a collection is called in too often, we actually exchange it with something else involved.

59:16.816 --> 59:20.220
So we do have flexibility because we're online.

59:20.555 --> 59:22.577
As they do as well, actually.

59:22.597 --> 59:24.919
It's called for, then they'll leave it in Cambridge.

59:25.299 --> 59:26.200
Right.

59:26.220 --> 59:32.426
So the difference is that ours is only at the edge of the apple with orchards on campus, it's not on the other.

59:32.446 --> 59:35.109
They share space with the primate center.

59:35.129 --> 59:39.393
They have monkeys on one side and books on the other.

59:39.813 --> 59:47.220
Don't think I'm not going to get that into the next book, one way or another.

59:47.808 --> 59:58.383
And you can have a sense of, I'm sorry, I'm trying very hard to meet the Harvard standards, but I just don't think I can match that.

59:58.924 --> 01:00:01.107
More examples of John Dean's work.

01:00:01.247 --> 01:00:09.078
We have the ability, we're very fortunate here, as curators, we can send materials to conservation and they come back immediately in boxes.

01:00:09.098 --> 01:00:14.946
So these are actually fan-fold manuscripts from the Asia Rare collection.

01:00:16.647 --> 01:00:35.972
many of which are paper mache with bits of water glass and very nicely boxed so that we can deal with our materials intelligently.

01:00:36.012 --> 01:00:37.634
Second part of the vault?

01:00:37.654 --> 01:00:38.014
I'm sorry.

01:00:38.034 --> 01:00:39.055
Second part of the vault?

01:00:39.075 --> 01:00:43.761
Yes, which is on the mezzanine level, but it's the very top floor.

01:00:44.943 --> 01:00:45.844
It's a half level.

01:00:46.651 --> 01:00:50.295
And that holds all the flat material, mostly map cases.

01:00:51.337 --> 01:00:53.880
Actually, this is a perfect example of what I was just telling you about.

01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:57.804
These are trucks that are left over from presentations from last week.

01:00:57.824 --> 01:01:02.009
This is a course called Cornell 101, which deals with the history of the university.

01:01:02.170 --> 01:01:03.732
And that's the charter of the university.

01:01:03.752 --> 01:01:05.754
Yes, the actual charter of the university.

01:01:05.774 --> 01:01:13.283
This was a course on... This was a presentation to the Board of Trustees, which included...

01:01:13.803 --> 01:01:17.989
an overview of how we use materials in the instruction program.

01:01:18.010 --> 01:01:19.692
And these are largely maps and charts.

01:01:19.792 --> 01:01:28.466
Well, actually, this also includes the Gettysburg Address, the Emancipation Proclamation, and the Thirteenth Amendment, all in the original documents, and original manuscript.

01:01:28.546 --> 01:01:32.292
Le Brasier's notebook for the discovery of the formula for water.

01:01:32.672 --> 01:01:34.776
Which you're holding in your hands right now.

01:01:34.796 --> 01:01:39.863
And signed by LaFosse and the major scientists of the period.

01:01:40.244 --> 01:01:41.346
These are the Joyce notebooks.

01:01:41.987 --> 01:01:42.207
Ah.

01:01:42.811 --> 01:01:48.598
The reason they're free like this is that... That's a little tactile kick for me.

01:01:48.618 --> 01:01:53.164
This is from the Norisica chapter of Ulysses.

01:01:53.224 --> 01:02:01.534
So this was a very high-end discussion for the Board of Trustees that included a variety of materials for a portfolio.

01:02:01.634 --> 01:02:04.578
Cornell has all... And as we speak, they're on these little trucks.

01:02:04.598 --> 01:02:06.200
They're meant to be reshelled.

01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:07.141
They're on the way to be reshelled.

01:02:07.161 --> 01:02:08.903
We're looking at precious items in a...

01:02:09.423 --> 01:02:10.584
That's wonderful.

01:02:10.644 --> 01:02:15.108
This was the freshman course on the Arthurian legend in Chaucer.

01:02:15.188 --> 01:02:21.153
It includes Mallory, Nuremberg Chronicle, medieval manuscripts as examples, chain book.

01:02:21.854 --> 01:02:22.635
Where's the chain book?

01:02:22.975 --> 01:02:24.056
The chain book is actually right here.

01:02:26.278 --> 01:02:27.078
Still have a chain on it?

01:02:27.339 --> 01:02:29.200
Yeah, yeah.

01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:29.861
Oh, that's great.

01:02:30.101 --> 01:02:31.102
Fabulous, isn't it?

01:02:31.162 --> 01:02:31.943
Yeah, that's wonderful.

01:02:32.003 --> 01:02:32.924
I've only seen one other.

01:02:32.984 --> 01:02:33.945
My first.

01:02:34.045 --> 01:02:35.326
Is that right?

01:02:35.346 --> 01:02:36.207
Yeah, my first.

01:02:36.287 --> 01:02:37.928
I've had three collections.
