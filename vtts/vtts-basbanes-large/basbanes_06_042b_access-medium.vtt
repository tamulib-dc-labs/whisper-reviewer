WEBVTT

00:04.098 --> 00:04.438
Of course.

00:04.478 --> 00:05.119
We're back on.

00:05.299 --> 00:05.640
Okay.

00:06.701 --> 00:07.222
Round two.

00:10.245 --> 00:13.569
We talked about affection.

00:15.051 --> 00:16.512
Let me tell you the title of my book.

00:16.532 --> 00:18.815
The title of my book is A Gentle Madness.

00:18.915 --> 00:21.338
Did I tell you that title?

00:21.478 --> 00:27.625
I derived that from a characterization Isaiah Thomas' grandson made.

00:28.297 --> 00:32.143
after his death, my grandfather was afflicted with the gentlest of infirmities.

00:32.163 --> 00:33.144
He was a bibliomaniac.

00:33.224 --> 00:34.686
I mentioned that to Colin Franklin.

00:34.706 --> 00:37.671
He said, I think you should call it the gentlest of infirmities.

00:38.132 --> 00:38.993
I said, that's British.

00:39.173 --> 00:40.755
I said, Americans understand.

00:41.116 --> 00:51.351
Well, clearly I'm writing about the passion, and I would say after 30, close to 30 years of the book trade, you have seen a lot of

00:51.955 --> 00:53.437
Yes, I would not characterize it.

00:53.457 --> 00:53.858
I would not.

00:54.739 --> 00:57.123
I'm not one to object to other people's titles.

00:57.143 --> 00:58.325
I have no problem with your title.

00:58.926 --> 00:59.647
I haven't found it.

01:00.848 --> 01:04.694
I think the word gentle is... Well, it's an oxymoron answer.

01:04.714 --> 01:10.944
And I don't think of it in those ways.

01:10.964 --> 01:16.512
It's...

01:21.385 --> 01:29.953
There's nothing gentle about it from the booksellers' point of view, from the collectors' point of view.

01:34.638 --> 01:49.873
I have met, and I am very fond of my collectors, they sustain my every, and I of course lump the libraries in as well, they sustain my every moment, financially and emotionally.

01:51.203 --> 02:01.818
I have met one collector in my life who has earned my unqualified respect.

02:03.661 --> 02:06.545
One.

02:06.565 --> 02:18.342
His life was totally sustained and enriched by the books he collected and read.

02:21.224 --> 02:33.198
And although he was an extremely private and shy and withdrawn man, he was one of the great monologuists that I have ever met.

02:33.278 --> 02:35.180
Monologuist.

02:35.300 --> 02:35.521
Yes.

02:36.262 --> 02:49.577
And if given the opportunity to discuss or talk about some book or literary person or poet or film,

02:51.835 --> 03:04.938
that his interlocutor and he had experienced in common, he would repay to that person with his monologue and with his knowledge and information.

03:05.379 --> 03:07.282
And he was not an academic or a scholar.

03:09.005 --> 03:16.138
He would repay the

03:23.307 --> 03:29.837
He would share that which he had won for himself by his commitment.

03:32.340 --> 03:38.029
And he spent his whole life collecting secretly, quietly.

03:38.069 --> 03:39.851
He worked in the U.S.

03:39.871 --> 03:41.093
Post Office in Portland, Oregon.

03:41.153 --> 03:44.358
He, for a long time, made no more than $4,000 or $5,000 a year.

03:44.378 --> 03:49.025
He never made, I'm sure he never made more than $12,000 a year.

03:49.606 --> 03:51.148
This isn't the guy down in L.A., is it?

03:51.168 --> 03:51.829
No, in Portland.

03:52.214 --> 03:57.681
Oh, yes, no, I remember that, but I had nothing.

03:57.741 --> 03:59.803
That was a mad acquisitor.

04:00.144 --> 04:16.264
This was a serious book collector who smelled every book he bought, who didn't collect the major writers, who got rid of a writer he didn't like, couldn't stand the influence of Carlos Williams and Charles Olson on modern poetry, and therefore wouldn't have them in the house, and so on.

04:16.885 --> 04:19.710
He ended up with eight or nine or 10 or 12,000 books.

04:19.830 --> 04:22.575
Oh, that's a nice, manageable point.

04:22.736 --> 04:25.100
In a one-room apartment, and they were all fine.

04:25.881 --> 04:31.692
They were almost all 20th century, although his favorite poet was the Bronte sisters.

04:32.012 --> 04:33.515
Is this the person you can identify?

04:33.535 --> 04:35.318
His name was Fred Oral Jacobson.

04:35.358 --> 04:38.925
He died of cancer a couple of years ago.

04:38.945 --> 04:39.346
Fred?

04:39.827 --> 04:40.648
Fred Jacobson.

04:42.248 --> 05:08.847
He is the only person whose life was utterly sustained by books and who took no commercial interest in nor sought commercial benefit from the labors of his acquisition from his collecting, and who for years threatened to leave his books to Portland Public Library because that's where he learned to read, and that's where he was wakened to books.

05:09.367 --> 05:11.770
He did not, in fact, leave them to the Portland Public Library.

05:11.790 --> 05:16.115
He left them to his niece and to Artis Kennelly, a writer friend.

05:17.857 --> 05:21.822
Could you spell that name for me?

05:23.043 --> 05:29.571
Artis is A-R-D-Y-T-H-K-E-N-N-A-L-L-Y, or K-E-L-L-Y.

05:30.212 --> 05:32.775
He's a well-known Portland writer.

05:34.004 --> 05:42.533
But what he said he wanted to do was to give the books to Peter Howard and Charlie Selyazicki and Bob Hoyt, his three book friends, but he didn't put that into his will.

05:43.535 --> 05:45.757
So... You mean give, or are you concerned?

05:45.797 --> 05:46.057
Give.

05:47.119 --> 05:53.986
So I, Peter Howard, had to solve that problem of books, and I managed to solve it.

05:55.127 --> 05:59.853
And, in fact, managed... How did you solve it?

05:59.873 --> 06:00.894
I appraised the library.

06:00.914 --> 06:01.935
As it turned out,

06:02.320 --> 06:05.124
Fred wanted Artis and his niece to have the books they wanted.

06:05.144 --> 06:07.687
He didn't want them to have the money from the books that they wanted.

06:09.670 --> 06:10.150
Great story.

06:10.591 --> 06:29.796
But the niece and Artis wanted the money, and so what I did was appraise the library at their request and get the money divided up amongst the niece and Artis, Kenley, and Bob Hoyt.

06:31.666 --> 06:39.315
And then I bought the library, and I gave half of it to my friend Charlie Celuzicki, so that all of... Did you spell that name for the last guy?

06:39.335 --> 06:43.300
Charles Celuzicki, S-E-L-U-Z-I-C-K-I.

06:43.320 --> 06:44.241
And where is he from?

06:44.261 --> 06:46.945
He's in Portland now, via Baltimore and Salem.

06:47.645 --> 06:52.171
So that all of Fred's... This was a classic problem caused by books.

06:52.191 --> 06:52.752
A classic.

06:54.113 --> 06:57.377
So that, in fact, all of Fred's desires were accommodated.

06:57.397 --> 07:00.441
Meredith and his niece and Bob Hoyt

07:00.826 --> 07:28.090
got the books of their choice from the library or the benefit they were from, and Bob Hoyt, Peter Howard, and Charlie Selyazicki equally, or Bob Hoyt got all the books he wanted, and then Charlie Selyazicki and Peter Howard, both of whom he knew to be booksellers, divided the books equally, all that remained, and instead of getting them for free, they got them at a wholesale price and were able to recirculate the books.

07:28.190 --> 07:30.192
None of the books were such that they

07:31.032 --> 07:40.807
The books were all 20th century books and didn't need to stay together since the only thing that kept them together was Fred's imposing intelligence and his needs.

07:41.247 --> 07:45.874
Well, can you describe the character, if you can, briefly, the collection of the characters?

07:45.894 --> 07:56.230
The books were simply all of the poets of the 20th century whom Fred respected in the best possible condition that he could find, in the best possible condition.

07:57.880 --> 08:03.867
It's just that he had checked out every minor poet in the 20th century, English and American.

08:04.688 --> 08:14.239
And so in one place were books of modest value but of extreme scarcity, and particularly in the condition exhibited.

08:14.759 --> 08:27.634
And although Fred smoked for 25 years, and it killed him, and the spines of all the dust jackets were tinged with tobacco smoke to some degree or other, nevertheless, the books were still in fine condition.

08:27.985 --> 08:56.608
And he similarly explored prose so that he had collection after collection after collection of short stories and also the novels of writers who are not systematically attended to by dealers whose knowledge hasn't extended that penetratingly into our literature.

08:56.892 --> 09:06.381
Fred was the living exponent of the certainty that our literature is composed of more than the one or two hundred authors investigated by most dealers.

09:07.122 --> 09:19.393
And so there would invariably pop up books that none of us were familiar with, which then... He would tell you the things that he... Oh, he would never tell us ever what he was looking for.

09:19.533 --> 09:23.777
I mean, it was a rare day in hell when Fred would...

09:24.213 --> 09:35.130
let it be known that he was looking for any particular book, and when one day one of his friends found his list of books wanted and published in the A.B., it ruptured their relationship for many years.

09:35.210 --> 09:36.291
This happened?

09:36.311 --> 09:36.552
Yes.

09:37.313 --> 09:37.994
For many years.

09:38.014 --> 09:39.356
Was he that well-known a collective?

09:39.536 --> 09:43.803
No, but Fred was incensed that his privacy should be violated.

09:44.043 --> 09:47.088
How did that happen?

09:47.108 --> 09:51.334
Well, his book friend found his want list and published in the A.B.

09:51.483 --> 09:54.247
Oh, I see it as a search thing.

09:55.068 --> 09:57.731
A purported friend.

10:00.014 --> 10:01.436
No, he was, in fact, a dear friend.

10:01.456 --> 10:02.898
He just made an error.

10:03.498 --> 10:14.773
But when Fred would tell you that he was looking for Catherine Bush's Don't Ever Leave Me, which he only found without a jacket in his last year of life,

10:17.200 --> 10:20.644
It would waken you to the fact that there was a writer known as Catherine Brush.

10:20.964 --> 10:22.086
How do you spell her name?

10:22.146 --> 10:22.906
B-R-U-S-H.

10:23.747 --> 10:30.795
Catherine with a K or a C. K. And then, of course, one would look for that book and discover Catherine Brush.

10:30.855 --> 10:32.938
That's wonderful.

10:32.958 --> 10:41.548
And actually find out that Catherine Brush wrote a dozen books, but that Fred only wanted one.

10:42.549 --> 10:45.452
And then, of course, the burden was to find out why he wanted it.

10:46.529 --> 10:51.394
Did you ever sit down with Fred and talk about how this came?

10:51.414 --> 10:52.675
Oh, of course.

10:52.776 --> 10:58.642
Of course, but he was not one to talk about the books that he still needed.

10:58.722 --> 11:07.551
Not the books so much, but the development of the... Fred loved cats and would be the last to go to sleep.

11:07.571 --> 11:09.453
There was no way that Fred would ever retire.

11:09.953 --> 11:11.275
He had no family other than this?

11:12.176 --> 11:13.397
Basically no family.

11:13.951 --> 11:25.922
So in his last years, he was very close to Old Oregon Bookstore his whole life, Preston McMahon with his basis of operations from a book point of view.

11:26.122 --> 11:39.234
But in the later years, when Charlie Solyzicki moved to Portland, and whenever I would come to Portland, which was a couple times a year, we would all gather at Charlie Solyzicki's house and talk.

11:39.354 --> 11:43.418
And Fred was still talking when the rest of us fell dead.

11:44.275 --> 11:58.872
He was totally sustained by writers and their relationships with each other and with their writing.

12:01.855 --> 12:04.999
He was just one of those people that make it worth living to know him.

12:05.460 --> 12:07.722
Was he a formally educated man?

12:07.742 --> 12:09.564
No.

12:09.584 --> 12:12.408
How did he come to this?

12:12.428 --> 12:13.489
Those are the miracles that

12:14.617 --> 12:16.039
Or for others, too.

12:16.059 --> 12:17.121
Was he an Oregonian?

12:17.281 --> 12:17.421
Yes.

12:18.122 --> 12:19.725
That's wonderful.

12:19.745 --> 12:22.269
I don't have anybody about California for my books.

12:22.830 --> 12:23.050
No.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.353
I can't tell you how wonderful this is.

12:25.374 --> 12:26.014
Fred is.

12:28.058 --> 12:31.463
Fred was only a rumor, even in his own community.

12:33.806 --> 12:36.090
His funeral service was particularly obnoxious.

12:36.130 --> 12:37.692
He had wanted... Did you go to it?

12:37.853 --> 12:38.093
Yes.

12:40.553 --> 12:42.576
Yes, I made a special trip for that.

12:42.596 --> 12:43.557
You didn't tell me when this was?

12:43.577 --> 12:44.157
Thousand miles.

12:44.218 --> 12:45.139
It was a couple of years ago.

12:46.400 --> 12:57.114
And he had wanted, he was a great movie fan, and he collected records in the latter half of his life in the very same way that he collected books.

12:57.134 --> 12:58.635
He sought minor composers.

12:59.557 --> 13:00.878
He sought the imported record.

13:01.179 --> 13:02.720
He sought records in fine condition.

13:03.702 --> 13:09.649
He's the only person I know who systematically collected the popular song in America.

13:10.203 --> 13:15.208
he collected film scores and cast recordings of plays.

13:16.950 --> 13:23.016
To the extent they ended up with almost a thousand cast recordings and film scores.

13:23.416 --> 13:35.788
He had wanted the score of, oh shit, I've just forgotten the film.

13:37.000 --> 14:03.970
But even the minister's memorial address, when it came to book, came to a, and at that time his library had not been dispersed, the principal burden of the minister's address in remembering Fred to his few friends assembled was

14:05.080 --> 14:11.225
Fred was known to have gathered a large number of books and records which were extremely valuable.

14:12.647 --> 14:18.212
And it was a very unpleasing way to say goodbye to Fred.

14:20.393 --> 14:26.639
Particularly because, in fact, the value of the library was quite modest.

14:26.659 --> 14:33.585
I'd pay $42,000 to the library and would be very lucky to get $60,000 or $70,000 out of it in a reasonable time.

14:34.865 --> 14:47.239
But they were the most interesting little library that I've ever had, whereas other libraries, I had bought a Faulkner collection a few months before for $445,000.

14:47.259 --> 14:54.208
And that was actually another collector sustained by books.

14:54.868 --> 15:00.535
I've interviewed this gentleman, by the way.

15:01.443 --> 15:19.004
inwardly focusing manner of focusing on one author, he in fact was, as well as the same, simply a library in which there are 10,000 authors instead of one, is ultimately going to please more people in.

15:19.024 --> 15:22.308
Well, in the marketplace, perhaps, please more people.

15:22.709 --> 15:28.455
But Peterson's collection certainly is of greater significance as an archive, I think.

15:28.476 --> 15:31.399
Except that it's no longer an archive.

15:35.750 --> 15:43.620
I totally believed in the notion of a bookseller as a conduit, rather than as a focal point.

15:45.462 --> 15:55.795
And the bookseller's responsibility is simply to move the items along, whether they're newly discovered or not newly discovered.

15:56.956 --> 16:03.865
And so the glory need not center in the bookseller.

16:05.207 --> 16:05.487
I have

16:08.302 --> 16:12.308
a modest opinion of what booksellers do.

16:14.351 --> 16:18.737
It's just that there aren't enough of them, although many people feel that there are too many at all times.

16:19.939 --> 16:27.229
There are huge areas in the world where there are no booksellers, including the United States, Knoxville, Tennessee, twice the size of Berkeley.

16:27.249 --> 16:37.043
I broke down there once and had, all of a Saturday, a perfect bookseller day to go to the local youth bookstores.

16:37.597 --> 16:50.734
could not find a single second-hand bookstore to go to and never left the automobile dealer's premises in a town like the size of Berkeley, which has more than 50 bookstores people selling an antiquarian book.

16:50.754 --> 16:59.586
So when one realizes that, one realizes what a haphazard profession of bookselling is.

16:59.927 --> 17:04.853
You can put all the antiquarian book dealers in the state of Florida

17:05.288 --> 17:10.294
I covered half of them in four days.

17:10.574 --> 17:17.342
Right.

17:17.942 --> 17:24.970
Well, how do you, I mean, you mentioned, without mentioning Carl Peterson's name, but I interviewed Carl, and I've been with him in St.

17:25.090 --> 17:31.798
Louis last month, and he mentioned you and Marty Cole with great respect and affection.

17:32.158 --> 17:34.401
I wonder,

17:34.870 --> 17:45.263
Do you think that Peterson, he said that he would like to have seen it remain as a collection, but then where so much of it was printed books, how did you feel about that?

17:45.303 --> 17:48.927
Do you think that should have remained as a collection?

17:49.388 --> 17:54.734
You mentioned one of your functions as being a clundler.

17:55.155 --> 18:03.645
Would you have preferred to have been a clundler for that collection as a collection rather than the way it is now being sold?

18:05.448 --> 18:19.262
These are the questions that conflict with the practicalities of life and of being a bookseller, and if your idea to say precedes, you get into trouble.

18:22.446 --> 18:33.177
The bookseller's necessary function and almost certainly the first thing, the first responsibility is to survive and to continue.

18:34.118 --> 18:39.447
although violating the integrity of anything, it's very high up on things not to do.

18:42.592 --> 18:46.438
Here he's spent his whole life, and I know actually that Carl is feeling quite sour lately.

18:47.961 --> 18:50.505
At one point, it was almost measurable.

18:51.947 --> 18:54.551
He played me as Margaret Cohn tapes, Michael.

18:55.132 --> 18:58.017
At some point, Carl himself

18:59.515 --> 19:05.361
ceased thinking of his collection as a book collection and started thinking about it as a retirement fund.

19:07.163 --> 19:12.168
And I'm certain that this idea cost him as much stress as it did pleasure.

19:14.650 --> 19:24.140
Of course I would have been honored to be able to have kept it together.

19:24.160 --> 19:27.463
I initially plotted to

19:28.996 --> 19:46.820
sell it the day after I bought it for a modest percentage but a serious dollar profit to the most likely customer, a customer who, one, I was certain to afford it, two, I was selling it through a dealer with whom I got along famously and who represented this person.

19:47.521 --> 19:56.033
And although I thought this person, I had nothing but dislike for the ultimate customer in this instance, and

19:56.418 --> 20:10.396
This was a similar experience of every one of my colleagues' periods, with the one exception of the intermediary, who was probably more tolerant than us, and consequently could get along with such a person.

20:10.456 --> 20:19.769
It was my intention to sell it intact the day after I bought it, and simply move it across town, the same town.

20:20.810 --> 20:22.673
You were talking about Brodsky?

20:22.693 --> 20:23.033
Brodsky.

20:23.485 --> 20:26.548
And I felt at the time that the price was that I wanted.

20:26.568 --> 20:29.612
I mean, I had negotiated a price out of Peterson.

20:29.632 --> 20:31.013
You didn't tell me this, though.

20:31.033 --> 20:31.794
That's very interesting.

20:31.814 --> 20:33.616
I had negotiated a price out of Peterson.

20:33.636 --> 20:34.677
I spent a day with Braski.

20:34.717 --> 20:35.578
Why didn't he tell me this?

20:36.900 --> 20:37.861
He may not have known it.

20:38.521 --> 20:49.273
The circumstances of my acquiring the Carl Peterson collection are extremely complex, and yet they themselves are a history of the book trade as I know it, from my point of view.

20:51.633 --> 20:52.994
Carl's dealer was Margie.

20:53.515 --> 20:59.901
Carl is a classic example of how I function in the book business, and how I think could booksellers function.

21:00.521 --> 21:08.288
Carl was a Faulkner collector by dedication, commitment, and interest.

21:08.308 --> 21:21.100
And although there were other collectors before, notably Linton Massey, and other collectors after, notably Carter Burden, and Brodsky after.

21:21.485 --> 21:37.270
and notably collectors simultaneous, the most important of which was Toby Holtzman, Carl, by virtue of every quality of human being that we can denominate, deserved the Faulkner.

21:39.394 --> 21:48.488
He was more appreciative, he was more rigorous, he was more discerning, and yet he was the poorest, by far.

21:50.712 --> 21:57.580
Recognizing that, his best dealer, Margie, gave him first crack at all for him.

21:57.600 --> 21:58.401
I believe all.

21:58.681 --> 21:59.602
She loved him.

21:59.622 --> 22:00.163
He played him.

22:00.183 --> 22:01.604
They had a personal relationship.

22:02.805 --> 22:04.587
She was much his senior.

22:04.647 --> 22:06.530
They had a very close personal relationship.

22:06.550 --> 22:09.793
He was her closest friend.

22:09.813 --> 22:16.821
And as a consequence of having a good book dealer and a friend, Carl built the best collection in the United States.

22:17.003 --> 22:33.258
aside possibly from Virginia and certain institutional collections, and then Brodsky got in to the family and came away with a hundred presentation copies and a lot of letters, but nevertheless, Carl had the best bibliographical collection and the best condition collection, and he was ahead of everyone else with regard to knowledge, and he himself dug some very interesting things out.

22:34.759 --> 22:47.010
I inherited the relationship when Margie died in that I was the second most consistent supplier, and I had a similar attitude that he should have the book at the

22:48.627 --> 22:51.109
friendliest price, and that he should have it rather than someone else.

22:52.511 --> 23:04.782
And I was capable, although he was not the beneficiary of the screen material that I had turned up over the years, I had turned up a significant quantity of Faulkner screen material, which went elsewhere.

23:04.802 --> 23:10.167
Carl wasn't for some reason as fond of that, or it was a little too expensive for him, or whatever.

23:10.207 --> 23:13.150
But in any case, I inherited the relationship.

23:14.752 --> 23:18.415
When it came time to market his collection, he first went to his oldest

23:18.985 --> 23:28.317
bookselling connections, then living, which was Colophon Books, and it was his insistence that the collection remained together intact and be sold only to an American institution.

23:29.318 --> 23:33.844
And he gave Colophon a year to do that, and Colophon simply failed to do that.

23:34.986 --> 23:43.176
So I, in inheriting the opportunity to sell his collection, inherited that situation that had already been on the market for a year with no takers.

23:44.418 --> 23:48.503
It was then Carl's intention, if I did not buy it,

23:49.259 --> 23:51.282
to send it to Sotheby's and break it up.

23:53.205 --> 23:54.767
And that was going to be the end of the discussion.

23:54.807 --> 24:02.358
In fact, that was a hammer over my head that he made quite clear that if I did not buy it, he would send it to auction.

24:03.560 --> 24:07.025
I would certainly make every effort to buy in order to keep any other bookseller from having it.

24:07.686 --> 24:18.642
I felt that I was as close to Carl as any other bookseller, and I'm certain that's true in terms of being somebody he would trust to sell his collection to, in terms of the terms or whatever.

24:20.326 --> 24:31.276
And so I knew that I had to buy the collection.

24:31.296 --> 24:34.279
The next step was to find out how much it was.

24:36.681 --> 24:38.983
The price had been slowly rising over the years.

24:41.085 --> 24:48.932
And after a long and friendly dinner and such, we negotiated a handshake price while we were walking through the middle of Chicago in the dead of night.

24:49.942 --> 24:55.670
And the price was $445,000 half down and half in one year.

24:55.730 --> 25:18.700
And I subsequently involved three of my friends in this transaction to the extent that my principal partner in the matter put up the same amount of money as I, which was exactly one-half, or 51%, and others came in for the other 49%.

25:20.671 --> 25:28.459
And the half down was paid by the others, so the principal mover and his principal partner didn't have to come up with a dime for the first year.

25:29.920 --> 25:31.021
That's very clever.

25:31.041 --> 25:41.391
And it was my intention to sell the collection the next day after I bought it and walk away with a couple hundred thousand dollars profit, which I would make 50 or so, and my friend would make 50.

25:41.992 --> 25:47.337
And if that didn't work, we had a year to affect something else.

25:49.021 --> 25:50.463
Well, it didn't work, as it happened.

25:50.483 --> 25:52.885
Brodsky was going through a divorce, which I had no knowledge of.

25:52.925 --> 26:03.958
And he and his dealer weren't seen buying the collection for $670,000, which was my price.

26:08.083 --> 26:14.370
So, I determined that the next responsible thing that I had to do was to catalog the collection properly.

26:15.683 --> 26:20.148
I had Carl's catalogue of his own collection, and there were editions, of course.

26:21.089 --> 26:30.640
However, his catalogue, although a very useful bibliographical guide, was singularly unforthcoming about the nature of materials inside.

26:31.341 --> 26:32.022
Singularly.

26:34.865 --> 26:41.793
And I had to determine at that point, having committed $445,000 of my and my friends' money, what their books were worth.

26:43.214 --> 26:45.657
And to do that, one simply had the catalogue in.

26:46.615 --> 26:47.156
properly.

26:50.740 --> 27:09.505
And because there is no way you can catalog a copy of Mosquitoes for $18,000 without saying why it's $18,000 and another copy in the same collection is only $3,000.

27:10.266 --> 27:14.952
And there's no way of saying why a letter to a friend is worth

27:15.758 --> 27:24.269
$12,500 until you explore the nature of the relationship of Faulkner and the recipient of the letter and what the letter says.

27:24.329 --> 27:32.740
But Carl only says letter to a friend, whereas it was something rather more than that.

27:32.760 --> 27:44.635
So his catalog required, the books that are in his catalog required different kinds of descriptions, and I spent a thousand hours of my own time

27:44.935 --> 27:48.560
after 9 to 5, Catalonia and Spokane.

27:48.580 --> 27:49.921
Well, that took a year and a half.

27:50.001 --> 27:51.643
All of a sudden, $50,000 is not a lot of money.

27:51.663 --> 27:58.432
I actually may have only made $17,500 so far for a thousand hours' work.

28:00.254 --> 28:08.985
And then in addition to seeing that I had to describe the items accurately, I realized that I needed to

28:09.860 --> 28:20.732
Since I was involved in bibliographical description and relationships one to another in a bibliographical sense, I had to impose on his collection a somewhat different bibliographical structure, which I did.

28:21.553 --> 28:26.738
And that took an immense amount of time getting it right on its own terms.

28:26.758 --> 28:34.146
So that the catalog that I have done and I have polished, but which I have not yet printed, because I haven't yet determined how I want to print it,

28:34.784 --> 28:37.327
whether as a book or as a free catalog or as both.

28:37.347 --> 28:42.112
I would like to either purchase or get a copy.

28:42.693 --> 28:44.655
I have computer printouts, but that's it.

28:45.776 --> 28:51.082
I now have them at the Boston Book Fair, but I don't have anything to give away.

28:51.162 --> 28:57.889
If somebody sends me $50, I maybe would get a copy of you off.

28:59.827 --> 29:11.578
In the meantime, so I have, after now at least a year and a half, completed the catalog and I'm trying to figure out how to print it, whether as a book for sale or as a free catalog or both.

29:11.599 --> 29:20.387
In the interim, however, we have at the same time attempted to sell the books in the catalog or as many as we can do the most likely places.

29:20.407 --> 29:24.111
One of the reasons I took Jeff Marks for a partner in this was that he had customers.

29:24.952 --> 29:27.454
People often have customers who are not shared.

29:27.907 --> 29:50.530
And as it turned out, we had two serious private customers, actually three or four private customers and a couple of institutions, and I have managed, we have managed, to sell $607,000 of the Faulkner book.

29:50.550 --> 29:55.315
And everybody who had to pony up money in order to acquire the books

29:55.447 --> 29:56.508
gotten their money back.

29:56.589 --> 29:59.533
After one year, they all had exactly what they put in back.

30:00.234 --> 30:05.801
And after a year and three months, they had a 25% profit, including myself.

30:06.943 --> 30:10.347
And my money was only out for three months.

30:10.868 --> 30:15.555
So in terms of financial dealings, it was a modestly successful proposition.

30:15.935 --> 30:19.039
In terms of the work involved, I put 1,000 hours in.

30:19.059 --> 30:25.268
And I may be repaid for that by selling the catalog or future glory or future profits.

30:25.450 --> 30:32.797
then we have 75% or 80% of the books remaining, and they hold maybe 50% of the value.

30:33.677 --> 30:43.326
So there's additional profits to be guarded in the future without the burden of being forced to sell them because we have our money back plus.

30:44.447 --> 30:53.415
So I'm in a comfortable situation of having a vast stock of Faulkner, albeit much of it with no apparent customer, i.e.

30:53.615 --> 30:56.077
translations into foreign languages of books.

30:56.097 --> 31:01.763
They're not easily or readily sold, particularly for $60, $70, or $80.

31:01.783 --> 31:03.885
But then, nevertheless, they have a great deal of integrity.

31:04.766 --> 31:21.883
And so the notion of keeping a collection together, all the time which I was... We held the collection, I bought it on July 6th of 88, and we did not deliver a book until

31:22.589 --> 31:30.721
May 1st of 89, during which time we allowed ourselves six or seven months to sell a collection as a whole.

31:32.244 --> 31:39.875
But selling a collection as a whole involved having a proper catalog of the collection, and involving the proper catalog of the collection took a year and a half.

31:41.137 --> 31:51.533
And so such cataloging and such of Carl's work as was available to any prospective buyer was always available to any prospective buyer.

31:52.390 --> 31:58.577
so that anybody could or any institution could have bought a collection for a period of about seven or eight months.

31:58.637 --> 32:08.487
However, we did not wholly dedicate our, just a full-time lawyer, and I have run a full-time business with a $40,000 a month overhead.

32:08.548 --> 32:21.942
We were not dedicating ourselves solely to hauling a Faulkner catalog from door to door the world over in order to sell it, and I don't believe that I would have been successful had I done that.

32:23.187 --> 32:33.239
And so the economics of the transaction prevented us from selling it intact.

32:33.259 --> 32:42.771
One of the great modern phenomenon, or possibly not only modern, is taking a collection and breaking it, or finding a customer and building a collection.

32:44.132 --> 32:50.680
And there are no rules in either case.

32:51.284 --> 32:57.833
is happy to supply books to someone who's building, or one is happy to buy it after its building to carve it up again.

32:57.873 --> 33:09.269
And I would think that I have no idea of what percentage of collections built to stay together, but my guess is that not a lot.

33:12.233 --> 33:16.178
Institutions are not in the practice of buying

33:17.356 --> 33:18.838
especially modern author collections.

33:18.958 --> 33:20.240
Perfectly, a perfect example.

33:20.260 --> 33:32.759
Many collections are given, but most of the people that ordinary booksellers deal with are not mortals that inhabit the street in which books are bought and then given away.

33:33.961 --> 33:39.209
I think a perfect example of this, of a dilemma, is Carter Britton's collection.

33:39.229 --> 33:46.300
Bob Nykirk, who I interviewed a year ago, who's now since died, said, you know,

33:46.837 --> 33:51.704
He had talked about maybe the New York Public Library would be a home for this.

33:51.724 --> 33:53.867
He said, you know, they've got 90% of what he's got.

33:53.927 --> 33:56.330
I mean... Right.

33:56.370 --> 34:00.496
There certainly are some wonderful gems in there that they'd like to have.

34:01.898 --> 34:05.864
The Carter Burden phenomenon is an entirely different book story.

34:05.964 --> 34:07.226
Talk about that, please.

34:07.366 --> 34:09.008
I've interviewed Carter.

34:09.028 --> 34:11.872
Carter's subject as a phenomenon.

34:12.713 --> 34:16.118
Well, it was an interesting phenomenon, and it caused a lot of...

34:16.823 --> 34:22.349
It brought a great deal of benefit to the book trade.

34:22.409 --> 34:28.175
I think the benefit far outweighed its subsequent disadvantages, and it brought a considerable amount of grief.

34:31.098 --> 34:45.312
The phenomenon is the most interesting part about it, and the fact that it went more or less unfulfilled is only the story of human, not frailty, but

34:47.350 --> 34:58.168
the lack of harmony between the world's anticipations and beliefs and the capacity of an individual.

34:58.969 --> 35:12.852
The notion, as I understood it or articulated, even if Carter didn't, was a very simple one, that Carter had set up about collecting all of American literature

35:12.983 --> 35:13.904
from Mark Twain on.

35:14.224 --> 35:16.306
Basically from Waller Barrett on.

35:16.746 --> 35:22.491
He overlaps with Waller Barrett slightly, but he collected more or less in the same style as Waller Barrett.

35:22.511 --> 35:37.144
He collected the primary editions, he collected significant inscribed and bibliographical editions, and he collected representative, possibly representative, autograph material, although that was certainly not a focus.

35:37.164 --> 35:42.349
The joy was that Carter wanted one of every book by every serious American author

35:43.662 --> 35:54.752
And he inhabited science fiction, where he really got screwed, and all other fields where he really got the finest treatment in the world from the best dealers around.

35:54.812 --> 35:55.633
Everything gets screwed.

35:55.673 --> 35:58.876
The New York Public Library has that now, and they think that's wonderful.

35:59.736 --> 36:02.819
Well, we'll just drop the word, screwed, then.

36:02.839 --> 36:04.981
But perhaps you could say it in another way.

36:05.361 --> 36:06.562
What do you mean by that?

36:06.643 --> 36:08.244
Possibly not.

36:09.025 --> 36:11.627
We'll retract that.

36:12.080 --> 36:17.608
He built a collection of modern science fiction, which was possibly not his best collection.

36:17.628 --> 36:23.355
You think maybe that's why it now has a whole... Well, he never had the heart for science fiction.

36:24.357 --> 36:27.581
They weren't books he necessarily was interested in or understood.

36:28.763 --> 36:39.117
He only collected one aspect of them, and he may not have gotten consistently fine copies at consistently fair prices.

36:41.155 --> 36:45.902
The general notion, however, is that he was going to collect all of American literature, one each.

36:45.922 --> 36:47.644
What did you think when you heard that?

36:47.784 --> 36:49.687
Well, that he ever articulated it in that way.

36:49.727 --> 36:54.714
In fact, Carter would not articulate anything to me or to anyone else.

36:54.734 --> 36:56.036
He was receptive.

36:57.318 --> 37:10.757
When it was understood that he would collect an author, then if we offered him a book that he didn't have, he was generally appreciative and he ordered it.

37:10.957 --> 37:23.290
I was introduced to him by Margie Cohn, who I was certainly much beloved by Margie, and I deeply cared for Margie, and she was my mentor number one, one that I'll go down with.

37:24.732 --> 37:34.022
She brought him around on his arm and introduced him to me, and I had just acquired Toby Holtzman's collections not long.

37:34.122 --> 37:37.926
Toby was way ahead of Carter in terms of time.

37:39.087 --> 37:40.829
and wisdom in some ways.

37:41.030 --> 37:50.043
Toby's an extremely hard-headed collector in that even though he was a man of means, he was not going to pay too much for books.

37:50.143 --> 37:51.144
I don't know Toby.

37:51.164 --> 37:51.705
And he didn't.

37:51.985 --> 37:56.492
Well, Toby's another highly concerned person.

37:56.652 --> 37:58.134
I'll talk about Toby later on.

37:58.615 --> 38:00.878
I had bought a hundred author collections from Toby.

38:01.058 --> 38:02.721
He also collected American literature.

38:02.741 --> 38:04.904
Let's stick with Carter.

38:04.944 --> 38:07.828
Carter was into far bigger ideas than that.

38:08.298 --> 38:09.639
So the idea was simple.

38:09.659 --> 38:13.083
He was going to collect one each of American authors.

38:13.103 --> 38:28.638
Who the American author should be was up in the air, and I'm certain that Diler provided him with many authors, out of some sense of self-advantage, of course.

38:28.698 --> 38:29.820
Let me interrupt.

38:30.440 --> 38:33.343
But, from my point of view,

38:35.129 --> 38:38.592
Carter did exactly the right thing, he could have gone further.

38:40.874 --> 38:46.199
And he was extremely well served by the trade.

38:47.000 --> 39:00.171
And he began systematically acquiring fine copies and proof copies and inscribed copies of American literature from when he decided the starting point would be.

39:00.231 --> 39:04.275
And I think he decided the starting point would be from that period when he still could get

39:04.424 --> 39:10.052
the best stuff, and it was perfectly clear that he could no longer get the best stuff for Melville.

39:10.593 --> 39:21.288
It was possible to get it for Howells, and it was possible to get it for Twain, remarkably enough, but basically he started with Twain.

39:21.308 --> 39:32.445
He simply, and in ten years, and however many millions, none of us calculated accurately how many millions, maybe ten million, maybe twenty million.

39:32.705 --> 39:34.127
I doubt it was more than twenty million.

39:35.120 --> 39:38.343
The fact is, there are several remarkable facts.

39:38.783 --> 39:41.686
One, he built a fabulous collection.

39:42.727 --> 39:46.430
Two, it could be done, and it was done.

39:46.470 --> 39:56.058
And he got the greatest and rarest books that ever were instantly, simply because it was known that he could afford to pay for them.

39:57.219 --> 39:59.321
This lights up books of his eyes like nothing.

40:01.203 --> 40:03.945
And after a while,

40:04.988 --> 40:14.061
He got the services of the three or four dealers most capable of dealing in those books in a penetrating way and most capable of carrying him.

40:14.822 --> 40:16.284
He named for me three dealers.

40:16.504 --> 40:21.451
Well, there was Glenn Horowitz and Ralph Sipper, Joseph's provider, and Serendipity Books.

40:21.471 --> 40:23.574
But those people harvested the rest of the world.

40:23.594 --> 40:26.939
I mean, those books didn't just get born in the cellars of those booksellers.

40:26.959 --> 40:28.381
Those books had to come from somewhere.

40:29.002 --> 40:33.628
So the fact is that it involved the whole of the book world.

40:35.617 --> 40:41.565
Everyone in the book world supplied those books and were repaid in kind.

40:41.605 --> 40:44.389
Now, there were... Did he add some books, the market?

40:44.469 --> 40:48.354
Well, only superficially.

40:49.175 --> 40:53.260
The notion that anybody was sticking it to Carter was a silly one.

40:53.300 --> 40:57.386
First of all, he could be theorized to have the capacity to say no.

40:59.168 --> 41:05.016
He had the appearance of being trusting and not gullible, but simply trusting people.

41:05.941 --> 41:07.443
There were numerous problems.

41:07.543 --> 41:15.995
The problems would begin when, first of all, it all started with he on Margie's arm, and Margie wanted 10%, and he wanted to get out of that.

41:17.176 --> 41:21.542
But he realized that Margie couldn't possibly handle the volume of his desire.

41:22.283 --> 41:25.047
So that quickly ended rancorously.

41:25.087 --> 41:28.973
It ended, among other things, in a lawsuit, which Margie won for failure to pay.

41:29.533 --> 41:35.121
There came a time when Carter would order books from individual small booksellers and not pay them.

41:36.468 --> 41:45.661
And to this day he has not, I'm certain, paid Jeff Marks for books that he bought from Jeff, and this effectively cut him off from those dealers.

41:46.502 --> 41:51.409
They could not afford, even if they wanted to, and I don't think that many people wanted to sell Carter books.

41:51.429 --> 41:54.454
What kind of rationale would he have for not paying for books?

41:54.474 --> 42:04.568
This was the great mystery that none of us could understand, and Carter was unprompt and

42:04.953 --> 42:18.995
arbitrary about whom he paid and when, and this effectively reduced his relationships to the three dealers mentioned, who, it may be said, had personal relationships with him, i.e., they had dined with him, been welcomed into his home.

42:20.537 --> 42:27.347
There was never a face-to-face, you're going to pay me, aren't you, or this, but there was an implicit understanding that one would be paid.

42:29.290 --> 42:32.395
The problems that

42:32.763 --> 42:35.006
The problems invariably involved money.

42:35.066 --> 42:41.696
The problems were, how could this man of apparent unlimited wealth not pay his bills and not pay them on time?

42:42.758 --> 42:53.293
And so Carter's, but all of us had a piece of the elephant, and who knows what the elephant was or was like or is?

42:53.854 --> 42:57.700
None of us knew, and to this day I'm absolutely certain none of us do.

42:57.740 --> 43:02.567
I'm not certain that Carter knows, but it's presumptuous for me to even

43:02.969 --> 43:04.711
begin to discuss something of that nature.

43:04.771 --> 43:09.797
The fact is that people progressively were less and less swiftly paid.

43:09.857 --> 43:15.944
This reduced his relationships, but not his effectiveness in acquiring books, to the three booksellers in question.

43:16.284 --> 43:32.503
The three booksellers in question are fabulously gifted booksellers and unbelievably faithful and loyal booksellers, unlike many.

43:33.327 --> 43:40.293
so that we were committed to our collector, we also understood the long-range financial benefits.

43:40.313 --> 43:47.780
I would not have my little half-million-dollar building if Carter Burden had not existed, although Carter hardly contributed half-million-dollar profit to my business.

43:47.820 --> 43:52.544
But the fact is I would not have that building, which is redefining my life if it hadn't been for Carter.

43:53.045 --> 43:54.706
I have nothing bad to say about Carter.

43:56.287 --> 44:02.473
What happened was that there then became this notion that I, say, would articulate in this manner that

44:03.618 --> 44:06.701
that the booksellers felt that this was, in fact, what Carter was doing.

44:07.141 --> 44:10.844
He was collecting all of American literature, and therefore all of American literature would be made available to him.

44:10.884 --> 44:13.567
And all of American literature was made available to him.

44:15.769 --> 44:19.011
And he bought it, up to the point where he stopped buying it.

44:20.092 --> 44:24.596
And none of us have a clue as to why he stopped buying it, or why he stopped collecting.

44:24.696 --> 44:31.603
It seems inconceivable that it was money that stopped him from buying it.

44:32.003 --> 44:33.304
He said the West.

44:33.571 --> 44:36.515
He had a television station that was in trouble.

44:36.535 --> 44:37.637
He's in the media business.

44:37.677 --> 44:41.422
Maybe he was minus 20 million on a television station.

44:41.442 --> 44:46.530
But that... All the stuff is in storage now, you know.

44:47.611 --> 44:49.013
All of the stuff is not in storage.

44:49.674 --> 44:53.019
The... So... It's not?

44:53.159 --> 44:53.359
No.

44:54.801 --> 44:55.242
So...

44:57.753 --> 44:58.734
A lot of us.

44:58.895 --> 45:12.032
He had been introduced to me as having previously been a book collector by Margie, and then he had started collecting paintings, and then it became clear that he would sell paintings for a serious profit when it was to his advantage, and so on.

45:13.474 --> 45:24.489
What seemed quite clear is that he had trouble managing his assets to enable him to collect books in the way that he had imagined, or we had imagined he was, in fact.

45:24.509 --> 45:26.612
My guess is that he grew into

45:27.706 --> 45:33.273
the idea that I have articulated that he would be the cluster of all of modern literature and what he would do with it was his business.

45:33.293 --> 45:34.674
What does it matter what he would do with it?

45:35.055 --> 45:35.575
Give it away.

45:35.615 --> 45:36.436
It doesn't matter.

45:37.237 --> 45:38.659
He could afford to do it.

45:38.679 --> 45:40.401
The notion was that he could afford to do it.

45:41.943 --> 45:57.021
And if he could not afford to continue doing it, then he ought at least to have the moral courage and ability to tell his people that, possibly in advance, so that he would not be sticking people with serious skills, which he did do.

45:57.760 --> 46:07.915
To what extent Glenn Horowitz was negative, Cass was, since Glenn became ultimately the principal dealer and the single conduit.

46:07.935 --> 46:11.781
Then, after a while, you realize that he, well, the science fiction collection had been given away.

46:11.861 --> 46:16.988
I appraised it because I hadn't sold as much of it to him, and I appraised it on a strictly formulaic basis.

46:17.389 --> 46:20.173
And I appraised it for cost plus cost of living.

46:20.592 --> 46:24.337
And that was simply that, and they gave it away for cost plus cost of living.

46:24.357 --> 46:25.438
Well, what did you appraise it as?

46:25.458 --> 46:28.862
Well, whatever that ended up to be, cost plus cost of living.

46:28.882 --> 46:30.004
Do you remember what that figure was?

46:30.104 --> 46:35.090
I don't remember off the top of my head, and I should think it would be a total violation of confidence for me to remember.

46:36.151 --> 46:38.314
You can't believe me harassing me.

46:38.334 --> 46:50.008
So, you know, whatever I appraised it for, it was, it was, it was not at a, well, it's value now, and it's not relevant.

46:50.225 --> 46:54.169
I think it's fair to say that Carter didn't give it away in order to make a profit.

46:56.392 --> 47:07.905
Then, all of a sudden, one would see on the market his Anglo-American poets, namely first Auden, then Eliot.

47:08.505 --> 47:18.817
And then you realize that the idea was fractured, and that the books were going right back into the marketplace, probably to settle bills.

47:18.837 --> 47:19.978
And in fact,

47:21.933 --> 47:35.250
Ralph had a significant bill with Carter which was sold by consigning books, and I have no notion of the degree to which Glenn is having his bills paid by the consignment of books, but my guess is that that is exactly what is happening.

47:35.731 --> 47:48.447
And not only did he get his Eliot collection, but suddenly he got his Marianne Moore collection, which is a strictly American poet, so there went the notion that his poetry collection was still intact.

47:48.983 --> 48:10.526
So then, on those principles, almost anything is subject to being, and then he had sold his Edgar Rice Burroughs collection, and I believe, not his bomb collection, but he certainly had sold his Edgar Rice Burroughs collection as something that was certainly one end of his science fiction function.

48:10.546 --> 48:17.033
So the idea was fractured, and Carter was no longer perceived to be a buying, and so he was no longer

48:17.367 --> 48:34.591
even worth mentioning as a viable ongoing, since booksellers are totally committed to tomorrow, then barely interested in the past, except for the more scully and responsible ones, and today is only a way in which to get to tomorrow.

48:34.932 --> 48:36.334
They're deeply interested in tomorrow.

48:37.836 --> 48:41.281
So Carter was not in their tomorrows in that regard.

48:43.244 --> 48:45.687
In the meantime, however, he had put...

48:45.987 --> 48:49.771
Let's call it $10 million into the modern first edition book trade.

48:49.791 --> 48:56.619
Well, the modern first edition book trade, no single dealer lives on more than $20,000 a year.

48:56.639 --> 48:57.460
My guess is less.

48:59.943 --> 49:02.526
And so that money was a free-floating cannonball.

49:02.606 --> 49:03.447
It's still out there.

49:03.567 --> 49:05.449
What did you say?

49:05.469 --> 49:05.789
$20,000?

49:06.070 --> 49:10.695
Yes, all booksellers live on less than $20,000 on the whole, on the average less.

49:12.127 --> 49:15.871
So all that money that he put out there is still rocketing around the trade.

49:16.512 --> 49:19.635
It's still out there sustaining the modern persuasion trade.

49:19.655 --> 49:40.699
In fact, it's very safe to say that he gave it, it's not immortality, he gave it 10 or 20 or 30 years more life, guaranteed life, that is, by the injection of this money into the trade, because the money is still there.

49:44.560 --> 49:54.689
This was of inestimable benefit to the trade, and the trade ought to be extremely thankful, and I, for one, certainly am.

49:54.769 --> 49:57.752
You don't see him as a viable player now, though?

49:57.772 --> 50:07.661
Well, I don't know him to have bought a book in recent time, if he... And if he did, he... Well, who would know?

50:07.741 --> 50:09.323
Who would know?

50:09.363 --> 50:11.985
It was Glenn that bought what Glenn bought.

50:12.117 --> 50:18.506
And I couldn't, since I knew, we all have a record of what Carter has, down to the last itty-bitty look.

50:20.328 --> 50:24.013
I didn't perceive that he specifically was buying any Faulkner through Glenn.

50:24.634 --> 50:29.180
This was... But he may well have.

50:29.220 --> 50:31.864
Fine.

50:32.184 --> 50:33.406
I'm happy that he did.

50:35.910 --> 50:37.011
If he couldn't pay odds,

50:37.328 --> 50:45.758
In the end, then it must be a structural problem for Glenn to solve if he presumably can also pay Glenn.

50:45.778 --> 50:48.381
Therefore, Glenn has to get books on trade.

50:49.743 --> 50:56.370
I do a lot of that structural manipulation in order to make it possible for customers to have books.

50:56.390 --> 51:06.222
By taking other books and consignment and keeping records, it can be hairy if you are challenged and you haven't kept proper records.

51:06.522 --> 51:10.307
And it's extremely burdensome, time-consuming, and expensive to keep proper records.

51:10.327 --> 51:13.952
It involves elaborate bookkeeping, and I'm very good at doing that.

51:14.612 --> 51:26.247
But I know what's involved, and if Carter is buying quantities of books to Glenn and paying Glenn with consignments, there's an immense amount of trust required and good faith.

51:27.108 --> 51:34.538
And it's very difficult for collectors to have that all over the map, so it's probably quite...

51:35.007 --> 51:45.201
effective and useful for Carter to center his energies through a given bookseller who then administers the problems.

51:48.565 --> 52:04.947
So I have pretty much nothing but fond memories for the recent phenomenon of Carter Burden, but he's no longer an important, at one point he was more than 25% of my accounts receivable, which I think banks are inclined to tell you is a bad thing.

52:05.146 --> 52:12.737
And if suddenly the fear of non-payment arises, we can have uncomfortable nights.

52:13.017 --> 52:19.066
But in truth and in memory, the phenomenon of Carter Burden was a wonderful thing for the trade.

52:19.106 --> 52:22.792
There's always been these perpetual questions on our lips.

52:24.594 --> 52:30.062
What happens if somebody gets into the, as a dealer, gets into the trade with a lot of money?

52:31.384 --> 52:33.988
Because none of us have a lot of money, he can...

52:34.643 --> 52:36.425
dominate and control.

52:37.066 --> 52:45.735
Well, the only time that somebody got into the manifestation business with a reasonably large sum of money, vast compared with the rest of us, that did not happen.

52:46.796 --> 52:56.887
And the one time that one collector with an apparently unlimited sum of money got into buying books that are very inexpensive, he got the books.

52:57.027 --> 52:57.708
He got them all.

52:57.768 --> 52:58.609
They left him
