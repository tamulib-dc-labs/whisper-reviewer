00:05.313 --> 00:32.400
It seems like it's saying something and it's saying strongly, but I'm not sure it's really asking me to remember what I think about it.

00:32.583 --> 00:48.047
Well, say the same as you think it's the same.

00:48.067 --> 00:48.988
I don't really think I understand this at all.

00:49.677 --> 01:01.248
I mean, you just understand the words in general, but I can't get much, you know, like, but I mean, at the same time, it's not so, like, blatantly obvious.

01:01.449 --> 01:04.932
There's nothing so blatantly obvious to me that tells me that there's nothing beyond that.

01:04.952 --> 01:11.619
Like, I know that there's something beyond what I've gotten, because of the fact that what I've gotten is so vague.

01:11.839 --> 01:16.123
I just, I mean, there seems to be some sort of, I don't know, there seems to me a description of, uh,

01:16.103 --> 01:19.207
I don't know.

01:19.227 --> 01:21.029
I don't know.

01:21.049 --> 01:31.802
I mean, if you mean a generalist or kind of the way people relate to, and what people on the coast relate to, you know, country or something like that.

01:31.822 --> 01:34.305
I want to close what you're saying about that.

01:34.325 --> 01:36.728
I think it's talking about...

01:38.311 --> 01:54.724
People in general do not look at things.

01:54.744 --> 01:56.387
They look at things that apparently have a great deal of theft and theft.

01:58.274 --> 01:59.035
.

01:59.055 --> 01:59.716
.

01:59.877 --> 02:18.949
.

02:18.929 --> 02:28.883
It's not even significant in describing.

02:29.463 --> 02:32.127
We have to.

02:33.208 --> 02:43.062
It's not even the form that seems to me to be saying, we can't see fog, we can't see these, but that doesn't stop us from this.

02:43.082 --> 02:45.325
The key is burning.

02:45.878 --> 02:53.452
I mean, if you're listening to people, I mean, it's kind of different.

02:53.612 --> 02:54.914
You just want to look at it.

02:55.054 --> 03:01.947
And if you can't be able to do that in that way, I'm sure.

03:01.967 --> 03:04.892
I mean, it can happen in a lot of ways, if you don't make this, you're going to be able to do it.

03:04.912 --> 03:07.136
You're going to be able to do it.

03:07.156 --> 03:09.861
At least in times, like outside, maybe.

03:09.841 --> 03:24.305
I mean, there's a way of thinking of things where you begin to see, you know, the object is there, of course, and everyone sees the world the same way.

03:24.325 --> 03:30.415
It's not like when people look further out of the ocean or can see through the water, but there's so much more sitting at that again.

03:30.395 --> 03:47.779
I think there's just a question of how much more multi-national reality actually is.

03:47.759 --> 04:11.151
that was when people came there every time

04:11.840 --> 04:35.620
Why do people look at the tree and not the land?

04:41.624 --> 04:44.612
Is it because they think somehow that it varies more?

04:44.792 --> 04:57.827
I guess the land may vary more, but whatever the truth may be, I guess I'm wondering whether one possibility is that there's something changing of the land.

04:58.043 --> 05:13.538
i guess like that would be perhaps one different something one thing that's different about the sea from the land the fact that it really isn't manifest motion or it might be that another difference between land and sea is people don't really say they live in the land and they're looking at

05:13.518 --> 05:22.770
they're looking at the sea, which is something different and foreign and alien, and if that's the reason why they're looking at the sea, I would read this poem as less critical of people.

05:22.830 --> 05:32.843
I think, you know, we sort of read this poem and we're like, oh yeah, all these people, they're just staring fixed or whatever, they're looking at the sea.

05:33.886 --> 05:40.417
There might be good reason for them to all look at the sea.

05:40.958 --> 05:44.904
I guess I'm not too sure whether that's the case or not.

05:46.106 --> 05:47.208
I don't really know.

05:47.368 --> 05:56.483
If I knew why they were looking at the sea, maybe I would have some idea.

05:57.064 --> 06:00.450
I don't know whether it was possible.

06:00.920 --> 06:29.425
I don't know whether it's why he brought up the truth, whether he came, and also the Romans, I don't know whether he came, there is truth in the land, or he is saying the truth actually is in the land, or he is saying the truth is in the land, or he is saying the truth is in the land, people are in the land, or the truth is in the land, people are in the land.

06:30.181 --> 06:56.037
uh the land may vary more but whatever the truth is whatever the truth truth is about that question of which has more variance to us see that's what i thought but it's wherever not whatever and so there's some i mean there's something about that so i get it so i think that it's not perfectly clear that that way like i think that i'm you know just instinctually putting whatever is

06:57.400 --> 07:01.116
because in the community I don't know whether

07:01.585 --> 07:17.886
right for people who don't get to see him somehow, exactly right, just because everybody is doing it, I thought maybe he is saying, oh, everybody is doing it, sir, it's not something for them.

07:18.868 --> 07:24.295
Then I don't, I don't find that kind of interesting.

07:24.315 --> 07:30.563
It also probably is that it's not just that there is no force in the community or they can't.

07:31.403 --> 07:39.013
You can't look deep in the ocean, and you can't speak all around the world.

07:39.033 --> 07:42.098
It's very interesting.

07:42.999 --> 07:53.653
It's fairly suggestive that their lives have something metaphorical, and that it's not the problem that they can do the work in the world.

07:53.673 --> 07:54.795
Take a look at the last few lines for that.

07:54.775 --> 08:19.433
Yeah.

08:19.835 --> 08:25.105
We will be talking on Monday.

08:25.626 --> 08:26.267
Monday?

08:26.287 --> 08:26.888
Friday.

08:27.209 --> 08:31.256
About design and the gift card.

08:31.276 --> 08:31.777
And the what?

08:31.938 --> 08:41.235
The gift card.

08:41.215 --> 09:06.565
How much time did you go?

09:06.545 --> 09:12.637
I do too.

09:12.838 --> 09:21.195
I do too.
