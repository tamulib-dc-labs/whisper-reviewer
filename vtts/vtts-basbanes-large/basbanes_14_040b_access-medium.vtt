WEBVTT

00:01.567 --> 00:02.428
Go ahead.

00:02.448 --> 00:07.392
This Wagner, he made the first sea atlas, Proprio Dicto.

00:08.433 --> 00:16.540
So he... other atlases before him had perhaps one or two charts.

00:17.041 --> 00:23.526
But this atlas contains about 50 sea charts.

00:23.766 --> 00:25.128
This is the first atlas.

00:25.628 --> 00:28.010
And it was printed in London in 1588.

00:28.471 --> 00:31.253
And I have...

00:31.520 --> 00:45.402
no less than the dedication copy to the Chancellor, Sir Christopher Hatton, because this atlas was dedicated by Wagner to Sir Christopher Hatton, and I have Sir Christopher Hatton's copy.

00:45.643 --> 00:47.485
Yeah, it's very important about the year 1588.

00:47.686 --> 00:51.051
That's the Spanish Armada year.

00:51.071 --> 00:52.173
Yeah, of course, of course.

00:52.273 --> 00:58.523
It all works together, so to say.

00:59.296 --> 01:11.894
Well, my copy, unfortunately, lacks four charts, but nevertheless, it is magnificently colored, and it is in the original binding done for Christopher Hatton with his initials on the binding.

01:12.495 --> 01:14.678
So, I mean, what can you expect?

01:16.040 --> 01:24.793
One title is lacking in four charts, but nevertheless, it's the finest copy of this pioneering work.

01:24.813 --> 01:25.534
Okay, okay.

01:25.774 --> 01:26.595
Should I come with you?

01:26.956 --> 01:27.717
No, I bring you.

01:28.338 --> 01:35.147
We have a client here holding the Christopher Hatton atlas with his device there?

01:35.267 --> 01:37.911
Yes, with his initials.

01:37.931 --> 01:38.231
H-C-O-C-H.

01:39.132 --> 01:39.733
Yeah, yeah.

01:39.753 --> 01:40.074
Look here.

01:40.975 --> 01:42.337
And here you have the dedication.

01:42.357 --> 01:45.901
To the right, honorable Sir Christopher Hatton, H-A-T-T-O-N.

01:45.921 --> 01:47.043
He was the Lord Chancellor.

01:47.243 --> 01:49.486
Knight, Lord Chancellor, everyone.

01:49.546 --> 01:56.315
Look at the... You see, that was built to take to see, too, I think.

01:56.535 --> 01:57.397
It's very compact.

01:57.417 --> 01:57.737
Yeah.

01:58.274 --> 02:00.357
Look at it.

02:00.978 --> 02:05.545
And there are 45 charts of that quality in it.

02:05.565 --> 02:16.301
It was the first time that all the coasts of Europe and also of Africa have been charted together.

02:16.401 --> 02:21.328
You know, there were single Portulans and so on, but never before

02:22.692 --> 02:25.937
And you see this is preserved in the original binding of 1588.

02:26.357 --> 02:30.202
And you can see that this was constructed to carry to sea.

02:30.383 --> 02:31.044
Yes, yes, yes.

02:31.184 --> 02:31.624
It's compact.

02:32.045 --> 02:32.986
Yeah, it's compact.

02:33.687 --> 02:39.155
And here you see that we have an assembly removed board charts out of this?

02:39.175 --> 02:40.076
Yes, yes.

02:40.156 --> 02:41.218
It's criminal.

02:41.358 --> 02:42.660
It's a pity, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:43.060 --> 02:45.424
And they really tore them off, you know.

02:46.605 --> 02:47.607
Look here, look here.

02:47.647 --> 02:52.193
I mean, this is really vandalism, one model.

02:52.932 --> 02:54.954
It's a pity but perhaps I can.

02:55.435 --> 03:08.189
So this is also one of the reasons for me never to offer this because I always hope to be able to improve it or to complete it from another copy.

03:08.929 --> 03:15.376
And perhaps it will be possible because I did this before without it.

03:15.777 --> 03:18.300
You see here, this is the second title.

03:18.620 --> 03:21.403
The title is lacking and this is the second title.

03:22.868 --> 03:25.312
So you've collated this against other companies?

03:25.332 --> 03:38.134
Yes, yes, I've collated this, and I had a, I had a, here, field title and carton 1, 14, 15, and 20.

03:38.154 --> 03:43.944
But nevertheless, I mean, it's the finest copy that you can ever, ever find.

03:44.004 --> 03:47.931
So if you are able to improve it, you would certainly...

03:49.042 --> 03:52.566
You'd make note that this has been approved with... Of course, of course.

03:52.606 --> 03:56.871
I mean, this has to be mentioned.

03:57.192 --> 04:08.184
One could even just lay the chaff that one can acquire... In the appropriate spots.

04:09.065 --> 04:15.873
Either this or at the end, or one could add them in a separate box or so.

04:15.914 --> 04:16.634
That's interesting.

04:16.654 --> 04:18.036
So that it is just...

04:18.353 --> 04:20.436
The perfect, but of course not.

04:21.498 --> 04:25.324
But it is, of course, sophisticated in this way.

04:25.925 --> 04:33.076
But you can also sell this the way it is, because this... Look at that.

04:33.116 --> 04:37.884
Though it is imperfect, it is perfect, so to say.

04:37.924 --> 04:45.255
And the preservation is very fine.

04:47.378 --> 05:14.871
this is to be mended maybe if people come in to do that kind of work are you saying yes either well with small things my restores book binders come here and do this here and with the more important more with the more extended things I send them to to my restores to Oxford or to Paris

05:17.635 --> 05:18.376
That's wonderful.

05:18.496 --> 05:20.878
Yeah.

05:20.898 --> 05:25.723
I've never seen... No, it's very, very rare, you know.

05:25.763 --> 05:44.723
Even the other editions, the Dutch edition, and there's also one French edition, they are so rare that in the last 20 or 30 years only one other copy

05:49.259 --> 06:14.794
or seven years ago but this is the original English edition and it is also much larger because the others they are oblong folio you know not not folio so so that the charts are only this this big see what I can see about this instantly is that this was made for a semen this was made for

06:14.977 --> 06:18.722
This was made for an officer who went to sea.

06:19.023 --> 06:23.189
Well, I don't think so, because it has been made for Christopher Hatton, you know.

06:23.229 --> 06:24.891
This is Christopher Hatton's copy.

06:25.372 --> 06:31.881
But, of course, ideally, he was supposed to take it to the sea.

06:33.723 --> 06:40.613
And so they constructed it for him to ideally take it to the sea.

06:40.795 --> 06:43.858
But I don't know whether he had ever... He never did, probably.

06:43.918 --> 06:45.820
Probably, because he was low chance.

06:45.840 --> 06:53.367
It just looks so compact, and it looks constructed in a manner that... for portability, I guess.

06:53.908 --> 07:05.619
I think that they constructed this to be able to take it with you on a ship, of course.

07:06.400 --> 07:09.283
But this is too...

07:09.820 --> 07:11.562
Finely preserved, I think.

07:13.545 --> 07:15.007
I think you're right.

07:16.449 --> 07:32.512
That one could presume that it has never been brought to... Can you surmise how the vandalized pages... What kind of lapse happened that somebody actually had access to tear out pages, I wonder?

07:32.792 --> 07:36.958
Well, one can imagine that

07:42.608 --> 07:44.651
of what they liked.

07:46.634 --> 07:47.315
That could be it.

07:47.676 --> 07:53.465
Yeah, perhaps because otherwise it is unexplainable.

07:53.685 --> 07:56.530
Otherwise there's always a thief there who's taken the whole book.

07:56.590 --> 07:58.793
Yes, he would have taken the whole book.

07:58.813 --> 07:59.615
Yes, I think.

08:00.156 --> 08:10.692
Or they just wanted, they were totally illiterate people and they just wanted some

08:14.030 --> 08:18.555
So they tore it off, but it's a great pity, one has to say.

08:18.996 --> 08:24.082
Can I ask you, last night you were saying that how some books go for six figures, seven figures.

08:24.262 --> 08:24.502
Yes.

08:24.722 --> 08:30.469
Are any of the books that you showed me in that range, would you say?

08:30.489 --> 08:32.371
Yes, yes, of course, I mean, most of them.

08:32.391 --> 08:33.613
Most of them, okay.

08:33.633 --> 08:41.522
The Grazian, it cost one million Deutsche Mark on vellum, and

08:41.924 --> 08:57.482
And you have to imagine, I mean, I bought this eight years ago, seven, eight years ago, and it then already cost me $300,000, which then was much more than $600,000.

08:57.922 --> 09:06.312
So after seven or eight years, you are nearly forced to

09:08.266 --> 09:18.918
to ask that some to get a certain profit out of it because don't forget the interest.

09:19.418 --> 09:23.462
What amazes me is that you aren't in any rush at all to move these things along.

09:24.083 --> 09:24.283
No.

09:24.964 --> 09:26.846
And really, I think I'm the only one.

09:26.906 --> 09:30.330
I was going to say, it would almost behoove you to have flow.

09:31.171 --> 09:33.293
Yes, of course, in a business sense.

09:33.373 --> 09:34.835
But my business is very good.

09:34.855 --> 09:37.918
I do it very calmly, very...

09:38.185 --> 10:06.167
very subdued and I collect and then I publish a catalogue once or twice a year and then I sell as much as I ever want to sell you know and sometimes I even don't sell if I do not like the ones who the way it's shaping up so

10:06.991 --> 10:12.759
then I have enough money or even more money than I need.

10:13.720 --> 10:15.944
And then I can make plans for new catalogs.

10:16.604 --> 10:18.868
And these catalogs really, I mean, they are my life.

10:19.889 --> 10:26.879
And if they are enough for others, this is just fine.

10:26.899 --> 10:29.262
I bet there are people who collect your catalogs.

10:29.302 --> 10:29.963
Yes, of course.

10:30.584 --> 10:32.286
I mean, my catalogs are collected.

10:32.987 --> 10:34.129
I would have to think they are.

10:34.582 --> 10:36.364
And this is the 40th that you're working on?

10:36.585 --> 10:38.948
Yes, the 40th and the 41st.

10:38.988 --> 10:42.192
So that's maybe two a year.

10:42.513 --> 10:43.354
Yes, exactly.

10:43.614 --> 10:44.135
Two a year.

10:44.896 --> 10:45.958
We published two a year.

10:46.498 --> 11:02.901
In the first years, they were small catalogs, but soon they developed into a larger size and into a more important illustration, and then also in a...

11:05.615 --> 11:13.408
sort of description that you can call sufficient or even scholarly.

11:14.490 --> 11:22.463
And so the kind of catalog that we do evolved.

11:22.904 --> 11:26.850
I show you my catalog of botanical and zoological books.

11:27.632 --> 11:29.715
With this we had, well,

11:30.235 --> 11:34.540
And I do want to look at the book you brought to dinner last night that we never had a chance to look at.

11:34.881 --> 11:36.422
Oh, yes, yes, I bring it.

11:37.003 --> 11:37.624
By town.

11:38.845 --> 11:40.027
Catalogs like these.

11:40.167 --> 11:41.989
Botanic.

11:43.231 --> 11:45.053
Botany and zoology.

11:46.054 --> 11:48.517
Where do you have these then printed?

11:49.398 --> 11:51.100
This is printed in Germany.

11:51.240 --> 11:57.728
You see here is one of eight colored, one of eight known copies of Basler, the most magnificent.

11:58.130 --> 11:59.672
botanical book ever published.

11:59.992 --> 12:06.219
It had 367 plates like that, and this is one of eight known copies with the original coloring.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.743
Nicholas Barker wrote on this copy.

12:10.484 --> 12:10.804
He did?

12:11.085 --> 12:11.605
Yeah.

12:15.690 --> 12:17.792
Only here do you know that it's a catalog.

12:18.093 --> 12:21.997
That's amazing.

12:22.037 --> 12:22.218
Yeah.

12:22.538 --> 12:26.162
This was the richest manuscript herbal in the world.

12:28.960 --> 12:38.291
It had 629 representation of herbs and and and and and flowers and so on.

12:38.311 --> 12:40.213
Now this is 34 and 35.

12:40.373 --> 12:43.397
Yes because it contains botany and zoology.

12:49.323 --> 12:57.853
We should have published this separately but I thought this way with a 400 and the 420

12:58.120 --> 13:00.964
pages or so, no, 440 pages.

13:01.365 --> 13:02.347
I've never seen anything.

13:03.068 --> 13:04.029
No, no.

13:04.089 --> 13:05.071
This does not exist.

13:05.091 --> 13:13.524
And we had, you see, Duhamel de Monceau, the copy of King Louis-Philippe of France, and all these things.

13:13.544 --> 13:21.015
I mean, not only were there the books you always liked to have, but the finest copies, you know.

13:21.636 --> 13:26.524
And this gives you a way of, I guess, of kind of keeping a

13:29.896 --> 13:32.860
This is my way of keeping the record.

13:33.040 --> 13:34.842
The recording has passed through your hands.

13:35.083 --> 13:36.925
And your custodianship, so to speak.

13:36.985 --> 13:37.306
Yes.

13:38.447 --> 13:42.432
This is very rewarding for me.

13:42.452 --> 13:45.576
You have a long shot, a detail.

13:45.717 --> 13:47.499
Yeah.

13:47.579 --> 13:49.181
But your photographer is excellent.

13:49.301 --> 13:52.245
He is very good, yeah.

13:52.566 --> 13:59.835
The lilies of the only known totally uncut, untrend copy.

14:00.743 --> 14:01.804
to survive.

14:02.865 --> 14:05.027
Has this moved along to the other pans?

14:05.067 --> 14:05.948
Yes, yes.

14:06.188 --> 14:07.749
All these things have been sold.

14:08.510 --> 14:10.712
And most of the finest things too.

14:11.493 --> 14:23.583
Long leaf of two melon leaves from this block book of the apocalypse, you know.

14:23.603 --> 14:26.166
And this is 1440 or so.

14:26.526 --> 14:28.708
So it's before Gutenberg or

14:29.043 --> 14:58.932
at the very latest the same time as Gutenberg because the illustration and the text has been cut into wood you know so this is say the medium between manuscript and printing with movable types the block books are very very critical yeah they are and I had the last complete block book oh I give you that catalog

15:06.910 --> 15:09.155
This house is deceptive.

15:09.236 --> 15:12.022
It just keeps going and going and going.

15:12.042 --> 15:15.270
Yeah, always, always.

15:15.290 --> 15:17.736
And this must be Dutch, of course, this painting here.

15:18.057 --> 15:19.099
No, it's Chardin.

15:19.580 --> 15:21.645
La mer la beuse.

15:28.612 --> 15:58.602
you said this house was 1716 no this this house is from 1918 you know I saw the old house in which you live in oh I see from 1716 I show you the date on the on those wooden

16:00.067 --> 16:01.569
panels.

16:01.589 --> 16:10.561
Come with me.

16:10.721 --> 16:16.249
Look at the beam.

16:16.349 --> 16:17.871
Look here, 1716.

16:18.352 --> 16:25.201
And this is LV, LV, Ludwig, I don't know, Derzeitverwalter.

16:25.582 --> 16:28.065
So he was the guardian of the mill.

16:28.450 --> 16:35.521
Because, of course, the mill itself belonged to noblemen, you know, the Herren von Klingenberg here.

16:36.283 --> 16:40.730
And he had only the right to use this mill.

16:40.930 --> 16:42.092
And what was the mill?

16:42.112 --> 16:43.054
What did they mill?

16:43.634 --> 16:44.356
Well, everything.

16:44.436 --> 16:48.923
I mean, barley, for instance, corn or whatever.

16:49.595 --> 16:55.203
And that's the name of the property, which translates Beaver Mill, I guess it is?

16:55.304 --> 16:56.025
Beaver Mühle.

16:56.465 --> 17:03.296
Well, that small river that you crossed in coming here from Steinheim Rhine, this is called Beaver.

17:03.876 --> 17:10.386
So the mill at the river Beaver, of course, was called Beaver Mühle.

17:10.867 --> 17:14.252
And the Beaver is still running into the river Rhine.

17:14.620 --> 17:26.634
These are all reference books, but this is the new catalogue of German literature, you know, with the finest copies of German first editions that one can ever imagine.

17:27.015 --> 17:31.240
This is one of the rarest books in German literature, Nathan der Weise, by Lessing.

17:32.682 --> 17:37.367
First impression of the first edition, and it's round like that.

17:37.788 --> 17:40.070
I mean, you never find a copy like that.

17:40.170 --> 17:41.472
Lessing was a librarian.

17:41.873 --> 17:43.755
Yes, in Wolfenbüttel, by the way.

17:43.896 --> 17:48.101
This is Wolfenbüttel about what you asked me yesterday.

17:48.241 --> 17:49.382
He was in Wolfenbüttel.

17:51.625 --> 17:56.611
This is the finest copy known of Heinrich von Ofteding and von Novalis.

17:56.651 --> 18:00.536
He's also a very important German romantic writer.

18:01.177 --> 18:02.599
This is on large paper.

18:02.939 --> 18:07.665
It's totally uncut and preserved as it appeared in 1802.

18:08.226 --> 18:11.610
This is Schiller's

18:12.772 --> 18:29.562
You know, the rarest book in German literature, the first book of... And this is the first edition of the first, the first printing of the first edition.

18:29.702 --> 18:31.225
And look at the condition.

18:31.245 --> 18:32.788
And the condition is just marvelous.

18:37.375 --> 18:39.057
You still get excited by a book.

18:39.077 --> 18:39.858
Yeah, of course.

18:39.878 --> 18:41.239
I mean, you have to.

18:41.339 --> 18:43.101
This is really inevitable.

18:43.521 --> 18:47.005
Look, this is for someone who lives in Switzerland.

18:47.686 --> 18:51.710
Especially, this is Wilhelm Tell.

18:51.730 --> 18:53.391
You know, his first edition.

18:53.752 --> 18:59.357
And with eight original drawings by Ramberg, who is a very renowned German painter.

19:00.479 --> 19:02.280
But these are original watercolors.

19:03.021 --> 19:04.523
Oh ja, ich danke Ihnen.

19:04.543 --> 19:04.783
Vielen Dank.

19:09.083 --> 19:32.779
and this is one of two copies known and the only totally complete copy of this block book of the art of dying the art of dying and it is colored and it and and the text has been cut in wood and so it is totally complete so i thought i

19:33.012 --> 19:42.748
must have a facsimile made, and I wrote a commentary on it, which is my catalogue, so to say, my catalogue 33, you see.

19:43.149 --> 19:55.490
And Nigel Palmer from Oxford wrote a night's foreword, and of course you get this, you can take this with you, you don't have to look at it now, but you just take this.

19:55.510 --> 19:56.331
You're giving that to me?

19:56.391 --> 19:57.513
Yeah, of course.

19:57.914 --> 19:59.256
Would you write something, Ellis?

20:00.097 --> 20:01.940
Yeah, of course, I write something.

20:02.220 --> 20:12.455
And he wrote, and I like this very much, the unusual distinction of producing both the largest and the smallest catalog we have seen this year.

20:12.955 --> 20:25.193
The smallest measures 1.47 to 1.12 millimeters over the slip case that contains two volumes, catalog 33, an admirably thorough description and analysis of the Furstenberg copy complete

20:25.527 --> 20:30.955
and unusually fine as the colouring and condition of the German Asmol-Yendi block book and so on and so on.

20:30.976 --> 20:34.160
So I give you this too, so you... Wow, okay, great.

20:34.181 --> 20:35.042
And I write something.

20:35.062 --> 20:35.302
Would you?

20:35.322 --> 20:36.324
That would be nice.

20:36.344 --> 20:36.745
Of course.

20:38.006 --> 20:38.728
You are kind.

20:42.974 --> 20:48.783
No, I'm not.

20:49.825 --> 20:51.548
I'm normal.

20:51.568 --> 20:53.070
I'm normal, but today...

20:53.624 --> 21:12.784
The normal is the utmost exception, it seems to me, because otherwise you can't explain most of the phenomena in the world.

21:12.804 --> 21:23.175
What I didn't explain at breakfast this morning, we were talking about the making of the catalogue, the beauty of the catalogue, but yet what is, what really...

21:23.864 --> 21:24.485
impressed me.

21:24.505 --> 21:28.192
It was your energy when you were with those books.

21:31.158 --> 21:32.601
Maybe I'm not describing it.

21:33.843 --> 21:38.993
This is essential for me.

21:39.013 --> 21:44.784
You know, one thing I didn't ask you, were you bookish as a youngster?

21:44.804 --> 21:44.944
Always.

21:49.413 --> 21:58.666
So, I mean, this may not be the most correct English of all, but I think you may read it.

21:59.407 --> 22:01.170
I will treasure it.

22:01.531 --> 22:03.814
No, really, it's a small jewel.

22:04.976 --> 22:12.126
The very day I published this catalog, I sold it to the Gutenberg Museum in Mainz.

22:12.226 --> 22:13.929
Where I was two days ago, by the way.

22:14.690 --> 22:15.351
I went to visit it.

22:15.611 --> 22:16.332
Aha, aha.

22:16.632 --> 22:20.818
And I sold this to the Gutenberg Museum.

22:21.059 --> 22:23.022
Which is quite a beautiful place.

22:23.122 --> 22:24.043
I'm going to write about it.

22:24.103 --> 22:26.587
It's very, very fine.

22:26.607 --> 22:28.249
And it's also very important.

22:28.269 --> 22:28.610
Look at this.

22:28.690 --> 22:29.752
It fits into my pocket.

22:29.952 --> 22:32.556
Yeah.

22:32.736 --> 22:36.582
It was destined to be taken with you.

22:36.662 --> 22:41.749
Also, the blog book was destined to be taken, to be read every day.

22:41.830 --> 22:45.475
To prepare for...

22:45.691 --> 22:49.916
But let's talk a little bit about your youth.

22:53.761 --> 22:56.845
I asked you if you were bookish as a youngster.

22:57.506 --> 22:59.228
Yes, I was always reading.

22:59.309 --> 23:04.355
I started reading as soon as I was able to read, six and seven years.

23:05.056 --> 23:11.204
And you know, in the 50s when I started reading, it was... Don't mind me.

23:12.405 --> 23:13.707
It was...

23:17.078 --> 23:20.704
It was totally different from today.

23:21.104 --> 23:34.546
Our children, they grow in the presence of... I can get there if you want.

23:35.167 --> 23:41.196
In the presence of TV and the presence of commercials and so on.

23:41.446 --> 23:52.700
But we, after the Second World War, you know, only 10 years away from the Second World War, when I started reading and so on, books were the essential food.

23:54.822 --> 24:00.269
And food of the mind, of course, intellectual food.

24:01.590 --> 24:05.195
And I read and read and could not get enough.

24:05.856 --> 24:07.858
And so it came that

24:08.193 --> 24:30.842
during my days and during my years of school I read through the whole world literature you know starting from the Gilgamesh epos in 2000 years before Jesus Christ with the pre-socratian philosophical writers and with Homer

24:31.295 --> 24:35.639
with Pindar, with all the Greek... Were you reading them in their languages?

24:35.920 --> 24:38.102
Were you acquiring languages at that point?

24:38.242 --> 24:45.529
Yes, I learned in school I had English, French, Latin and Greek, Old Greek.

24:45.549 --> 25:00.964
So I was prepared to read these four languages and of course the very, very difficult Greek poets or Pindar or Menander

25:01.282 --> 25:09.709
those I read together with a German, either with a German translation or with a commentary.

25:10.130 --> 25:12.632
Were you preparing to be a scholar in your mind?

25:12.652 --> 25:13.092
Yes, yes.

25:13.593 --> 25:19.818
I always thought that I had to prepare for a university career.

25:21.279 --> 25:26.164
This is a nice angle, by the way, with the painting over there.

25:26.264 --> 25:27.685
Have you seen this painting?

25:27.725 --> 25:31.288
This is interesting because it's a sort of

25:31.606 --> 25:38.016
pre-reflection of Watteau's embankment for Lille de Citerre.

25:38.898 --> 25:42.083
So, I read these languages.

25:43.265 --> 25:44.547
Was your family bookish?

25:44.868 --> 25:45.769
No, not at all.

25:46.049 --> 25:51.498
You know, my grandfather, he came from Bohemia, and my father came from Silesia.

25:51.578 --> 25:56.547
They both were refugees after the Second World War.

25:57.067 --> 25:58.289
After the Second World War?

25:58.410 --> 25:58.710
Yes.

25:59.095 --> 26:05.882
And they were expelled by the Czechs and by the Polish people.

26:06.803 --> 26:08.365
And Russian, of course.

26:08.645 --> 26:10.067
And what was your father's profession?

26:10.207 --> 26:13.270
My father was a dentist.

26:13.771 --> 26:17.895
And my grandfather, he was a farmer.

26:19.197 --> 26:27.145
Though a very wealthy farmer in Bohemia, but he had to start anew after the Second World War with nothing on his hands but his energy, you know.

26:27.513 --> 26:29.015
Well, it seems to run in the family.

26:29.075 --> 26:33.479
Yeah, and this is... So your energy is the word that I was writing all morning.

26:33.499 --> 26:38.764
Energy, energy is... Yeah, and my grandfather had a lot of energy.

26:39.425 --> 26:44.110
And my mother and my father met after the Second World War in Bavaria.

26:44.310 --> 26:53.019
And there I was born, and there was nothing whatsoever concerned with books in my family.

26:53.339 --> 26:57.503
Of course, there were some books, but nothing what we would...

26:57.922 --> 27:23.997
call book culture or library let alone so I had to make this myself the whole way and I did it with a certain enthusiasm with a perhaps sort of fever and I always liked to read and I always liked to get the knowledge get more knowledge and

27:24.213 --> 27:30.699
but also the sheer act of reading, you know, is very, very crucial to me.

27:31.120 --> 27:40.129
Not only to read because I know more afterwards, but also the very act of reading is very crucial to me.

27:40.149 --> 27:52.701
And so, when ending my high school, my what we call gymnasium, the high school, I was

27:53.879 --> 28:11.080
practically through with world literature and then I started I started with my studies in the University of Freiburg in Breisgar Romance languages, German languages and old languages.

28:11.161 --> 28:12.682
And did you finish all these programs?

28:13.203 --> 28:23.616
I finished them but then I did not make a dissertation because I was preparing a dissertation on the old Provençal poets Arnaud Daniel, Marc Cabrou

28:24.102 --> 28:51.409
incidentally it was on their way of hermetic writing it was a certain way of subdued poetry that lives in suggestions and not in outspoken terms

28:51.929 --> 28:58.375
So this is called Trobar Clues, closed poetry.

28:58.635 --> 29:20.957
So I prepared this dissertation, I had lots of materials, I had already hundreds of pages written, but then in 1977, exactly 20 years from now, I made up my mind and I

29:21.157 --> 29:24.801
recognized that the university was not my field.

29:25.382 --> 29:32.950
You know, that circling around one theme for 10 or 20 years... I think you like the excitement of things.

29:33.150 --> 29:36.654
Yes, and this was not... Which is why I chose journalism.

29:37.074 --> 29:38.756
I studied English literature.

29:38.776 --> 29:40.318
My degrees are in literature.

29:40.759 --> 29:47.586
So we are in a certain way... I do not want to compare myself with you, but our careers are

29:47.903 --> 29:51.727
are comparable because we all wanted the challenge.

29:52.788 --> 29:54.570
And we needed the challenge, you know.

29:54.831 --> 29:57.574
And there was no challenge whatsoever at the university.

29:57.594 --> 29:59.576
Because it's too protective and statical.

29:59.656 --> 30:06.704
Yes, statical and always only circling around one or two teams in ten years.

30:06.904 --> 30:09.327
And you snake on your turf and that's your little patch.

30:09.687 --> 30:11.329
And I make a catalog now.

30:11.647 --> 30:20.661
on 50 books, and every book is fascinating, every book is a new discovery.

30:21.302 --> 30:29.776
And so I make discoveries that universities take 10 years or so in a week or so.

30:30.437 --> 30:36.627
And so I never regretted one second in the last 20 years that I quit university.

30:36.647 --> 30:39.291
Here's a question that you can take anywhere you want, but

30:39.878 --> 30:47.286
We've talked about books of obvious value, but what to you is most precious about a book?

30:47.306 --> 30:50.870
And I mean the word in its purest sense.

30:51.270 --> 30:54.654
Well, I think we have to differentiate about this.

30:54.774 --> 31:07.388
Of course, if I have the first edition of the Faust fragment of Goethe in my hand, it is the literary context and the metaphysical context.

31:07.688 --> 31:09.711
background behind that book.

31:09.971 --> 31:21.887
I mean, this book was one of the two or three shaping cultural powers of the last 200 years.

31:22.828 --> 31:24.670
The past of Goethe, of course.

31:25.191 --> 31:34.323
And I have there, I have the finest copy of the past fragment of 1790 in Morocco binding with doublures.

31:34.743 --> 31:35.164
So I mean,

31:35.532 --> 32:05.202
here it is without a doubt the literary and more general the cultural impact of that small object but there are other things of course in a manuscript in a medieval manuscript it is most of all the artistic side because in a manuscript

32:05.502 --> 32:19.967
if it is not, say, the Ilias or the Odyssey of Homer, which does not exist in a medieval manuscript except for one in the Bibliotheca Amoriziana.

32:19.987 --> 32:20.568
I didn't know that.

32:21.710 --> 32:26.098
I mean, there are only two codices of Homer of the Middle Ages.

32:26.118 --> 32:27.240
They have to make it through.

32:28.233 --> 32:32.780
How did those epics make it through the oral form?

32:32.881 --> 32:36.126
Hidden away, tucked away in a cloister.

32:36.146 --> 32:37.608
You think it's something like that?

32:37.668 --> 32:38.830
Waste to be discovered?

32:39.491 --> 32:41.875
It's only hazard that they survived.

32:42.116 --> 32:42.897
It's only hazard.

32:43.698 --> 32:45.381
And because the...

32:45.732 --> 33:11.568
pre-Renaissance writers and the Renaissance writers, Pico della Mirandola, Marsilio Ficino, Lorenzo Valla, and all those, Coluccio Salutati, Boccaccio, Petrarch, proto-humanists, yes, because they searched for original manuscripts in Greek and in Latin in monasteries.

33:11.949 --> 33:13.731
And they found them...

33:14.032 --> 33:17.957
sometimes immediately before they were going to be destroyed.

33:18.778 --> 33:27.790
Because they went to a paper or to a vellum manufacturer who had them scraped off and so on.

33:28.291 --> 33:43.110
So we may say that perhaps we lost about 80% of the whole literary tradition of the antiquity, but we have about 80% of the more important texts at least

33:43.512 --> 33:47.378
in fragments or at least virtually complete.

33:48.079 --> 34:10.752
So if we keep away from the literary importance, which today is nearly impossible to find in manuscripts, though I have very important literary manuscripts,

34:11.238 --> 34:30.884
For instance, I have the oldest known manuscript of the Fiore di Virtù, which is a treatise based on Dante's writings, and which was one of the most widely read treatises of the late Middle Ages.

34:31.605 --> 34:36.271
And I have the first illustrated manuscript of this Fiore di Virtù.

34:36.291 --> 34:40.637
It's 1335, written in Modena with 37 miniatures.

34:41.731 --> 34:42.913
And so on.

34:42.973 --> 34:44.655
But these are exceptions.

34:44.675 --> 34:54.109
So normally in manuscripts what counts is the artistic value in the first place, and then the state of preservation and the provenance.

34:54.129 --> 34:57.494
And the completeness in the fourth.

34:58.195 --> 35:03.222
Because if the manuscript is really fine, it doesn't matter that two or three leaves are lacking.

35:03.262 --> 35:04.725
Because this always happens.

35:04.805 --> 35:07.028
I showed you the athletes.

35:07.048 --> 35:07.789
But...

35:08.107 --> 35:12.853
So we really have to divide between these two views.

35:12.873 --> 35:15.457
But they, of course, I mean, they belong to each other.

35:16.718 --> 35:21.605
But you can't say the most precious in a book for me is that and that.

35:22.566 --> 35:26.311
I have to say in a manuscript it is different from a printed book.

35:26.771 --> 35:32.158
In a printed book you even have to develop that site.

35:32.559 --> 35:36.544
But if we come to a view...

35:36.794 --> 35:50.992
that we are able to say there are four or five most precious entities in books, I think this is enough.

35:51.112 --> 35:54.276
And we have to discriminate, don't you think so?

35:55.798 --> 36:00.203
And if you are living in a thousand years or two thousand years, as I do,

36:01.010 --> 36:02.632
Really, I mean, I do that.

36:03.393 --> 36:24.098
You know, if you are living in the literary and cultural world of a thousand or two thousand years, so you are looking over a span of at least a thousand years, I have manuscripts from the 11th century here, I have

36:24.483 --> 36:29.631
artists' books from the 70s of the 20th century.

36:29.911 --> 36:37.082
So this is a thousand years that we look over in having a look into my treasure vault.

36:38.163 --> 36:50.862
So then you have to be discriminating on what attracts you or what is the most precious for you in a certain book, because book is not like book.

36:51.297 --> 36:55.924
An incunable... Oh, I show you the Philip Biblon.

36:56.044 --> 36:57.827
I would love to see that.

36:57.887 --> 37:00.330
No, this is for us too.

37:00.411 --> 37:15.533
I mean, this is a good... I think it's what we call...

37:16.475 --> 37:18.918
my tape, that's why I was taking notes furiously.

37:18.938 --> 37:24.445
I didn't want to break up the flow, but now I've got it going again.

37:25.286 --> 37:33.117
Do you think you could try and repeat the sentiments of what the philobiblon means to you?

37:33.137 --> 37:45.773
Well, to me, it's a sort of not only milestone, but it's a cornerstone to all we

37:47.069 --> 37:52.395
think, or we have read, or we feel about books.

37:53.016 --> 38:10.917
Because nearly everything that we can feel about collecting, that we can feel about our attitude towards the books, is at least seminary, written by this bishop, Richard de Bury,

38:11.335 --> 38:18.383
in the 13th and 14th century of our time.

38:18.824 --> 38:20.846
I mean, one has to think of that.

38:21.186 --> 38:32.719
And this is the first time that it got into the form in which we all recognize books in printed form.

38:32.960 --> 38:41.089
Of course there are manuscripts of the Philobiblon, but this is the first time that it got available to more than one or two or three books.

38:41.744 --> 39:05.476
So this is also metaphysically not... You cannot appreciate it, because to us it is like the Gutenberg Bible to just book-loving men, or just trained and learned and culturally trained men.

39:05.856 --> 39:09.962
But for book people, the Philobiblon is...

39:10.516 --> 39:12.498
the first and the last book.

39:12.518 --> 39:39.409
And repeat, not repeat, but say again, I was kicking myself, but I never had that on tape, but you're going through the provenance, and you said, Waddell Amherst Heights, and now, which is probably the last one, because... At least in my lifetime, this will be the last one, because I know exactly that this was

39:39.980 --> 39:58.849
the one and only copy for me to get in my lifetime because the other copy was the Wilmerding copy sold in 1951 in New York in the second sale of Lucius Wilmerding's books and it sold for the hugest sum in that whole

39:59.285 --> 40:07.896
very famous auction sale for $13,400, and it's now in Texas in the university.

40:07.996 --> 40:10.039
And you said if you were to sell this for a million dollars?

40:10.439 --> 40:26.760
Even if I could sell this for a million dollars or two million dollars, I wouldn't sell it, because there are things that mean much more than money to us, should at least mean much more than money to us.

40:27.128 --> 40:29.711
And I have other books that are worth that.

40:29.751 --> 40:32.694
Of course the inscriptions, the annotations in the back.

40:33.695 --> 40:42.885
They belong to that book because Michael Waddell, he was really one of the greatest book collectors of all times.

40:43.446 --> 40:49.913
And he noticed when he bought it, from whom he bought it, how much he paid.

40:50.298 --> 41:11.029
6 pounds, 16 shillings, 6 pence from Payne, the most famous bookseller of his time in London, and he bought it on November the 9th of 1802, and then he added some bibliographical notes, and at the end he noticed that he finished it on December the 5th of 1802.

41:11.330 --> 41:14.054
And can we just read the colophon for me once more?

41:14.094 --> 41:18.921
Yes, and the colophon reads explicit, so here,

41:19.340 --> 41:34.454
finishes, here is the end of, Philo Biblon, Sancti, Liber de Amore, Librorum, Colonia, Impressus, Anno Domini, Mille, Quattro Centorum, well, 1472.

41:34.474 --> 41:37.137
I realize I'm sharing in this.

41:39.038 --> 41:41.140
I'm getting a fragment of this book right now.

41:41.180 --> 41:41.861
You realize that?

41:41.881 --> 41:42.942
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:43.002 --> 41:49.228
Well, perhaps I send you a copy, a photocopy of that thing.

41:49.343 --> 41:51.827
You know what I'm planning to do?

41:52.347 --> 41:56.273
I wanted to do this for my 50th birthday, but I hadn't got the time.

41:56.914 --> 42:10.514
I wanted to make a facsimile of this original edition and to place against the facsimile my own translation of this book, to make a new translation.

42:10.614 --> 42:11.676
I think we need one.

42:11.696 --> 42:17.865
And then we have a nice book of 150 pages or so.

42:18.385 --> 42:24.775
And we have also a facsimile of the most important book for book lovers in the world.

42:26.958 --> 42:29.502
Well, I think I should do that.

42:29.783 --> 42:38.436
But it takes a lot of time because the Latin of Richard of Burry is very... It's serviceable.

42:39.337 --> 42:45.507
Yes, but it's that ecclesiastical Latin, you know, that attracted other...

42:46.094 --> 42:50.158
sense other meanings than the classical Latin that we know.

42:50.498 --> 42:55.503
But I know it very well, so it will take me perhaps two months or so to translate it.

42:55.523 --> 42:57.986
But the beauty of that is you've got forever to do that.

42:58.086 --> 42:58.306
Yes.

42:58.386 --> 42:59.788
Because that book's not going anywhere.

42:59.868 --> 43:02.050
No, I think I should do that.

43:02.290 --> 43:10.758
I wanted to send it then to my friends and to my clients as a gift to my 50th birthday, but perhaps I do it for my 55th birthday.

43:10.798 --> 43:13.401
I'm going to shoot a couple of shots, if you don't mind.

43:13.853 --> 43:16.976
Because if I don't mean it, I won't say it.

43:17.397 --> 43:20.320
You are always welcome back here together with your wife.

43:20.680 --> 43:32.792
And so what you cannot take or what you... Just a few shots to help me in the writing, you know, just little carnish shots like this.

43:33.433 --> 43:38.418
I usually carry much larger equipment, but on this trip I just carry this little camera.

43:38.438 --> 43:42.342
I'm going to buy contacts, I think, maybe even at the airport today.

43:46.625 --> 43:59.237
One shot from here.

44:02.720 --> 44:08.446
I'd love to get you sitting in that chair.

44:08.966 --> 44:12.970
This is the

44:15.295 --> 44:22.283
This little camera is not bad, believe it or not.

44:22.383 --> 44:23.284
No, no, I think so.

44:23.985 --> 44:27.409
I know my children have that too.

44:27.529 --> 44:28.310
This is my daughter's.

44:29.651 --> 44:34.837
My big Nikon, I have Nikon equipment in it, but it was too heavy for this trip.

44:34.897 --> 44:37.180
It's not so much better than this one.

44:37.240 --> 44:43.227
And really, unless you're doing fancy things with lots of lenses, but this gives you a nice

44:43.713 --> 44:47.998
composed shot, and the optics are terrific.

44:49.519 --> 44:53.063
You saw in my book, I shot most of the pictures in there.

44:53.103 --> 44:53.383
Really?

44:53.403 --> 44:58.289
I just wanted to say that the photographs were very good.

44:58.769 --> 45:00.851
I chose them all, selected them all.

45:00.932 --> 45:06.858
The old ones, of course, we bought, but the ones of contemporary people, I shot all of those.

45:06.898 --> 45:08.860
I love photography.

45:10.375 --> 45:11.697
Oh, well, this is great.

45:11.818 --> 45:14.643
I guess I want to get those books there.

45:16.827 --> 45:18.831
There are some interesting books here, you know.

45:19.492 --> 45:20.434
This is the G.R.

45:20.614 --> 45:23.139
Merriman School, the finest book on cruise ever.

45:24.221 --> 45:26.806
And this is one of two copies known on large paper.

45:27.567 --> 45:31.354
The four volumes down there.

45:42.134 --> 46:00.336
rulers of very important botanical books, as well as older ones, 16th, 17th century.

46:00.516 --> 46:03.640
You know what I'm saying?

46:04.021 --> 46:05.863
The recycling time is too long.

46:06.248 --> 46:08.270
Do you know the Contax camera?

46:08.491 --> 46:09.492
It's a German camera?

46:09.552 --> 46:10.093
Yes, yes, I do.

46:10.113 --> 46:16.140
It's supposed to be... Yeah, if I have time today, that's another thing, if I have time in Zurich today.

46:16.701 --> 46:20.105
Are camera prices expensive in Switzerland, or are they better in Germany?

46:20.125 --> 46:22.227
Oh, I think in Germany, yeah.

46:22.247 --> 46:31.178
Because in Switzerland they are about 30% more expensive than in Germany.

46:31.198 --> 46:33.741
Because, you know, it's the same, but...

46:33.991 --> 46:48.088
have been imported, not in the European Union, but in Switzerland, so... Oh, this is, yeah, just... Maybe just over here, so I can get these, and so I can get that, and I get the Schandrach.

46:49.709 --> 46:51.772
This is a great picture.

46:51.792 --> 46:53.454
This is a great picture.

46:53.474 --> 46:54.115
It's a great picture.

46:54.135 --> 46:57.599
It's important because it's reformed the Tsar's reform.

46:58.039 --> 46:58.800
This is wonderful.

46:58.860 --> 47:02.284
I'll show you the stamp.

47:02.424 --> 47:03.846
I just want to get a wide one here.

47:06.560 --> 47:07.201
Come on there.

47:09.064 --> 47:11.307
Well, let's just give it a second.

47:14.352 --> 47:16.936
My daughter's very good, and I said, I'm taking your camera.

47:16.956 --> 47:21.723
Bow for a bad day.

47:21.743 --> 47:30.517
Look here, I'll show you the example of the Daws library.

47:30.537 --> 47:32.500
We will take the Chelsky a cello.

47:32.851 --> 47:36.997
See, this was the private library of... Would you point at it again?

47:37.779 --> 47:42.205
This was the private library of Good Science, and there were the finest books.

47:42.225 --> 48:00.073
And look, there are a thousand, a thousand engravings, and then illuminated, not only colored, but illuminated, heightened with gold and so on.

48:00.374 --> 48:06.583
And this is bound by the finest French binding craftsman of the period, Jerome Leger.

48:07.004 --> 48:16.658
Here you have the initials of the Tsar, you know, Alexander I and Maria Pavlovna.

48:16.899 --> 48:24.610
This is also interesting, the works of Rabelais, you know, by Doré, and it's the only copy printed on vellum.

48:25.670 --> 48:31.317
They only printed one copy on valence, on the finest valence.

48:31.337 --> 48:33.580
You really have to weigh it to believe it.

48:34.161 --> 48:36.424
Come here, just take one hand.

48:39.408 --> 48:41.150
It's two valence.

48:41.591 --> 48:43.173
Look at that, on valence.

48:44.254 --> 48:50.543
This is the finest parchment that you can imagine.

48:50.563 --> 48:50.883
May I?

48:51.604 --> 48:52.285
And look here.

48:52.484 --> 48:55.688
They were so proud that they... Exemplaires unique.

48:55.708 --> 48:56.189
Exemplaires unique.

48:56.209 --> 48:59.553
Let's take a shot of that.

48:59.573 --> 49:00.674
Now, just a minute.

49:00.795 --> 49:02.657
It's better to take it here.

49:02.677 --> 49:03.518
Exemplaires unique.

49:03.538 --> 49:03.778
Here it is.

49:05.601 --> 49:07.003
How would you put this point together?

49:07.103 --> 49:11.468
Or we can take it together with it.

49:14.752 --> 49:16.795
This is also one of the 50, you know.

49:17.416 --> 49:18.477
Look how it is brown.

49:18.737 --> 49:20.319
And it is preserved like new.

49:20.840 --> 49:22.322
And it lay...

49:22.471 --> 49:36.070
And then they parted with it to a very fervent collector.

49:36.090 --> 49:50.790
And from him, the nephew of the original editor, no, the grandnephew, the grandson of the original publisher bought it back.

49:51.175 --> 49:53.197
And I bought it from his house.

49:53.217 --> 49:55.040
And it's Oeuf de Rabelais.

49:55.060 --> 49:55.901
Oeuf de Rabelais.

49:55.921 --> 49:56.581
Yeah, yeah.

49:56.842 --> 50:00.646
Tome Tiramille, Tome I, and Book I, Book II.

50:00.826 --> 50:09.236
And normally, both tome, both volumes are bound into one, and with the China paper copies, it's not thicker like that.

50:10.258 --> 50:14.343
And here you have the only copy printed on valor.

50:14.363 --> 50:14.743
The only copy.

50:15.244 --> 50:15.464
Yeah, yeah.

50:15.484 --> 50:18.047
Just get a picture of you with the wine in the background.

50:18.067 --> 50:18.988
Yes, okay.

50:19.137 --> 50:21.140
I've got one sitting, but that may not come out.

50:21.160 --> 50:22.983
There might be too much light for it.

50:23.023 --> 50:23.964
I have to get a picture in here.

50:25.607 --> 50:30.174
Well, this for me is the place.

50:30.194 --> 50:34.841
This is where we do the work, right?

50:35.482 --> 50:36.584
Yeah, of course.

50:37.846 --> 50:40.110
I work in here and in my stubby.

50:43.435 --> 50:46.900
That's a nice light.

50:47.150 --> 50:48.632
And here you have the rinds too.

50:49.253 --> 50:50.234
This is a great picture.

50:50.634 --> 50:52.056
This is a fine picture.

50:52.316 --> 50:56.041
You'll be in shadow, but that's okay.

50:56.221 --> 50:59.125
This is just really, this is going to be the nicest picture.

51:02.729 --> 51:04.571
Let me just come back a little further, make it long.

51:05.052 --> 51:05.753
Oh, you stay there.

51:06.794 --> 51:07.415
Can I stay here?

51:07.555 --> 51:09.518
Yeah, yeah, I like it, I like it.

51:09.618 --> 51:12.381
I think one could see the rinds.

51:12.631 --> 51:19.199
And the books will just be kind of like, and you will be in silhouette, but that will be... The frame.

51:19.219 --> 51:22.103
The books will be the frame.

51:22.123 --> 51:22.924
Okay, it's rewinding.

51:23.124 --> 51:25.166
That's great.

51:25.947 --> 51:26.888
That's a great picture.

51:27.269 --> 51:28.590
Yeah.

51:28.650 --> 51:41.406
I might even just... You see, I'm not only trying to get every book on books available, but I try to get the best book, the best copy, you know.

51:41.605 --> 51:51.114
I have one of the few copies of the Pierpont Morgan Library catalogue, of which only a hundred exist, that's found in full Moroccan.

51:51.214 --> 51:52.335
Look at that.

51:56.740 --> 52:03.026
And I always try to get the best copy of those books because they belong to me, you know, and they stay with me.

52:04.047 --> 52:06.830
I'm selling the other books.

52:06.850 --> 52:08.271
Slowly, but I'm selling them.

52:08.572 --> 52:13.018
But these books always belong to me, so I try to get the best copy.

52:13.298 --> 52:14.640
For instance, this one, you know.

52:15.161 --> 52:16.603
This is the copy of the author.

52:17.044 --> 52:19.527
And it is... Franz Bohata.

52:19.587 --> 52:23.613
Bohata, and you see... Who I quote in my opening in Gentle Madness, you know.

52:24.234 --> 52:26.096
Yes, and he had it interleaved.

52:26.396 --> 52:31.844
This is his main work on the Missalia, Catalogus Missalium.

52:31.864 --> 52:36.250
And he had it interleaved, and he had it heavily annotated.

52:37.073 --> 52:38.234
So this is interesting.

52:38.254 --> 52:39.155
That's his copy.

52:39.175 --> 52:40.136
That's his copy, yes.

52:40.297 --> 52:40.717
Hi, Hans.

52:40.857 --> 52:45.142
He was in my... He gave me the subtitle for General Madness.

52:45.162 --> 52:45.362
Yeah.

52:45.562 --> 52:50.488
He's the person who said, the bibliophile is the master of his books, the bibliomaniac and the slave.

52:50.828 --> 52:51.549
Yeah, yeah.

52:51.649 --> 52:53.671
And that's his quote.

52:53.692 --> 53:00.940
This is one of his very, very rare books, in the Liechtenstein Library.

53:00.960 --> 53:04.684
You know, this is... These two are his main books.

53:04.704 --> 53:06.726
And he also made this, the Libre d'Or,

53:07.178 --> 53:08.680
And then he told me to do the take.

53:09.181 --> 53:20.557
And I have, in Rotomusta, I have the only copy on valet, also his own copy, printed on parchment of the book of our photography.

53:21.178 --> 53:24.383
I have everything of him because I like him very much.

53:24.463 --> 53:34.958
He did a nice job and quite nice.

53:38.262 --> 53:50.533
And you know, this was the old mill house and they used to drive in here with a sort of factor as we call it.

53:51.454 --> 53:52.695
All the sun is here.

53:52.715 --> 53:53.135
Beautiful.

53:53.676 --> 53:57.739
This is going to be... Take another one.

53:59.241 --> 54:02.964
This is nice.

54:03.084 --> 54:06.387
I just want to get that out there.

54:06.427 --> 54:07.628
That's a little bit more.

54:08.840 --> 54:11.443
Perfect.

54:11.463 --> 54:12.124
Here's another one.

54:18.551 --> 54:26.159
You know, I'm the only one to have the whole catalogue general of the Bibliothèque Nationale, you know, 232 volumes.

54:26.940 --> 54:27.981
Look at that, I mean.

54:29.103 --> 54:30.284
And I have two copies of that.

54:30.864 --> 54:33.307
And this is ex-libris.

54:33.327 --> 54:36.771
Yes, it came from Los Angeles Public Library.

54:36.970 --> 54:37.410
Really?

54:37.511 --> 54:38.892
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

54:38.932 --> 54:42.475
And I bought it, bought it, uh... Prior to the fire, I assume, here.

54:43.456 --> 54:46.359
Why would they, just, why would they deaccession this?

54:46.379 --> 54:52.765
Well, perhaps they bought the CD-ROM or whatever, I think, because it takes, takes a lot, lot of space.

54:52.825 --> 54:54.007
Yeah, but that's very important.

54:54.107 --> 54:57.049
Of course, I mean, it's, it's the... A library should have that.

54:57.410 --> 54:57.770
I think so.

54:57.790 --> 54:59.071
That, that doesn't make sense.

54:59.232 --> 55:04.036
No, no, not to me, but, but I'm the one who preserves all these things, you know.

55:04.737 --> 55:06.859
I'm just going to get this line of bits right here.

55:09.404 --> 55:12.188
one of the most famous journals in German literature.

55:12.769 --> 55:30.838
It's the Horen, published by Schiller, you know, and the only known copy on large paper, totally uncut, untrimmed, and with dedications on nine of the twelve... Nine of the twelve...

55:32.084 --> 55:34.451
Is my train at 11.30?

55:34.892 --> 55:35.413
Yes.

55:35.855 --> 55:37.158
You know what?

55:37.199 --> 55:39.064
We've done it.

55:39.264 --> 55:41.571
But I'll be in touch.
