WEBVTT

00:05.043 --> 00:15.272
What is now on in librarianship, I mean, studying librarianship, we can also study the history of the book.

00:15.673 --> 00:17.834
It wasn't possible in the 70s.

00:17.854 --> 00:19.596
When we took our exam?

00:19.696 --> 00:20.157
No.

00:20.177 --> 00:20.937
No.

00:20.957 --> 00:24.300
So you had to be studied just by yourself.

00:25.681 --> 00:33.008
When you talk about the history of the book, of course, you're talking about what you can tell about history itself by studying books as artifacts.

00:33.460 --> 00:35.082
or the history of the book as an object.

00:35.202 --> 00:38.506
I'm curious what you mean by that.

00:38.526 --> 00:39.727
Both ways.

00:40.148 --> 00:48.237
Because there is a European discipline which is emerging, which has been emerging for the last 10 or 15 years in the United States, and it is called the history of the book.

00:48.297 --> 00:51.401
Yeah, Robert Darrington.

00:51.421 --> 00:51.982
Precisely.

00:52.022 --> 00:54.505
Elizabeth Eisenberg also.

00:56.367 --> 01:01.493
She wrote a wonderful book, but Darrington is the model right now.

01:01.945 --> 01:06.011
Can you say that Voltaire and Rousseau were responsible for the French Revolution?

01:06.031 --> 01:10.217
Exactly, that's the question he put.

01:10.918 --> 01:18.549
And it's a very interesting... Luther, would you have had the Reformation without the printing press?

01:19.270 --> 01:19.951
Obviously not.

01:20.392 --> 01:21.473
So these are fascinating.

01:22.855 --> 01:24.898
But you have the law in this country

01:25.317 --> 01:29.421
from 1661 saying that, yeah, well, sorry.

01:29.581 --> 01:35.507
No, you hear it again and you will hear it again and now you will remember it with my colleagues.

01:35.527 --> 01:36.928
I have corroboration as well.

01:36.948 --> 01:38.810
Yes, no, you will remember it.

01:38.830 --> 01:40.572
You tell it in your way.

01:40.632 --> 01:43.435
You see, we are parallel.

01:43.455 --> 01:45.937
We are like sisters, twin sisters in a way.

01:46.518 --> 01:50.401
But we have a different way to put it in a house, please.

01:50.622 --> 01:55.206
Yeah, well, I would say that the National Library

01:55.726 --> 02:07.020
comes because we have this law that every printer in the country should send one copy to the crown, to the king, to the palace.

02:08.102 --> 02:14.530
And they have of course discovered that the printed word was dangerous.

02:16.873 --> 02:22.560
So that you print, you can also spread a message.

02:23.401 --> 02:25.944
But that's precisely why they established that law?

02:26.364 --> 02:28.187
It was a law of censorship.

02:28.267 --> 02:32.371
So it was for all the wrong reasons, in other words, as we would think.

02:33.413 --> 02:37.457
Yeah, but we had then, we had a very young king.

02:37.477 --> 02:48.670
Maybe I'm not making, you know, generally speaking, you'd think that you would deposit books because you want to preserve them, and you have a deposit, but really... No, no, no, it wasn't a message.

02:48.690 --> 02:51.754
It was a control of what was printed.

02:52.477 --> 03:00.504
But it turned out well for us, because we have now all these old prints.

03:02.526 --> 03:04.648
Did they ever censor things that came in?

03:05.268 --> 03:08.351
I mean, did they look at a book and say, no, this is bad?

03:08.932 --> 03:12.595
And did they then prohibit the dissemination of those books?

03:12.675 --> 03:13.175
I don't know.

03:13.436 --> 03:18.820
We don't know that, because those books probably... Well, we don't know.

03:18.840 --> 03:20.762
No, we don't know if it's...

03:21.265 --> 03:25.008
was put here in the casser or if it was thrown out.

03:25.028 --> 03:32.575
In the 18th century there were prohibited books but I know very little about it.

03:32.595 --> 03:36.559
But there were prohibited books here as in France.

03:37.180 --> 03:42.865
But I wondered did you keep a copy here and still order that these books not be distributed?

03:43.425 --> 03:44.786
We don't know.

03:44.867 --> 03:48.690
When I was in Leipzig the other day it was very interesting.

03:48.890 --> 03:56.801
They took me to the top floor of the library there, and there they have, behind locked doors, the Exile Library.

03:56.821 --> 04:14.766
These are books of Jewish authors that Goebbels ordered kept, but they banned them from being read and being distributed, but so that they were able to keep, of course the Germans keep records of everything, that they could keep a record, they kept the books.

04:15.347 --> 04:16.669
So the books are still there.

04:17.155 --> 04:19.118
Did Anton write about that, too?

04:19.218 --> 04:19.438
Yes.

04:19.739 --> 04:20.740
Yes.

04:20.860 --> 04:21.982
Isn't that interesting?

04:22.202 --> 04:23.584
Yes, indeed.

04:23.884 --> 04:24.886
But we don't know.

04:24.906 --> 04:27.730
And we're not interested about Sweden.

04:28.190 --> 04:30.513
And again, you know how I found this?

04:30.734 --> 04:31.955
Totally unexpectedly.

04:32.756 --> 04:38.745
Just the same way we found out right now about the Nobel Prize that I'm going to go visit today.

04:39.225 --> 04:41.769
While I was looking, I was in Leipzig to see the machines.

04:42.730 --> 04:44.833
And then they said, you want to come upstairs and see the books?

04:45.100 --> 04:45.943
And I said, sure.

04:46.284 --> 04:48.712
And then there's the, and they call it the Anne Frank.

04:49.735 --> 04:50.137
Yeah.

04:50.478 --> 04:53.428
Oh, they call it the Anne Frank, of course.

04:53.448 --> 04:55.254
Yes, that's a good reason.

04:55.274 --> 04:56.859
And they call it exile, though.

04:56.959 --> 04:58.384
It's just a little,

04:58.887 --> 05:02.872
euphemism for what it really is, the Exile Library.

05:03.513 --> 05:05.596
It should be a little stronger than that, I think.

05:05.616 --> 05:08.039
Indication, anyhow, in the name.

05:08.059 --> 05:08.700
And then you know what?

05:08.720 --> 05:11.664
There's a little yellow sticker on every book that says Exile.

05:12.986 --> 05:14.528
And I took some photographs.

05:14.548 --> 05:16.491
I can imagine.

05:16.511 --> 05:19.535
Now, did you see our new National Library?

05:19.976 --> 05:20.997
No, I haven't.

05:21.449 --> 05:23.491
Because that's worthwhile to thank you.

05:23.511 --> 05:25.814
Mr. Mays Bains came here yesterday, you see.

05:25.834 --> 05:27.055
Just last night.

05:27.075 --> 05:28.477
Last night, yeah.

05:29.098 --> 05:33.242
And Nicholas might be arranging some of that stuff for me, too.

05:33.503 --> 05:35.625
You will have a full day tomorrow.

05:35.905 --> 05:39.149
This is what it looks like, you know, now.

05:39.629 --> 05:42.593
It's been open since April.

05:42.853 --> 05:45.416
Well, it has been... How far is it from here?

05:45.776 --> 05:46.377
20 minutes walk.

05:47.251 --> 05:49.274
But very close by taxi, right?

05:49.294 --> 05:51.497
Very close, in five minutes by taxi.

05:51.617 --> 05:55.262
But I mean, it's the old building from 1877.

05:55.622 --> 05:57.284
Maybe I'll go this afternoon.

05:57.705 --> 05:58.226
Yes.

05:58.306 --> 05:59.828
You should call either.

06:01.290 --> 06:03.392
I've got the whole day.

06:03.412 --> 06:04.834
Wilson would be the right person.

06:05.335 --> 06:05.775
Yes.

06:08.479 --> 06:08.880
Won't he?

06:09.540 --> 06:11.002
You ladies are wonderful, thank you.

06:11.022 --> 06:11.763
Yes, we know.

06:12.284 --> 06:16.009
And I want to take your pictures before I go, too.

06:17.744 --> 06:29.659
Let me just say, I'll turn this off.

06:29.679 --> 06:38.790
In the mountain, they have been putting dynamite into the mountains.

06:39.271 --> 06:40.973
Oh, dynamite.

06:41.313 --> 06:44.778
Invented by Mr. Nobel as a matter of fact.

06:45.619 --> 06:46.460
That was his invention.

06:46.560 --> 06:47.481
Yes, yes.

06:47.630 --> 06:50.172
And the Nobel Prize.

06:50.233 --> 06:51.153
That's right.

06:53.275 --> 06:54.757
Now you have the connection.

06:54.777 --> 06:58.160
Well, I don't think I need that.

06:58.340 --> 07:00.562
But you know, it's fun.

07:00.582 --> 07:01.263
It's fun.

07:02.224 --> 07:05.467
And of course the Library of Congress in the United States.

07:06.188 --> 07:08.270
So maybe half a dozen national libraries.

07:09.251 --> 07:11.473
Shall I call them?

07:11.493 --> 07:12.314
Antoine, of course.

07:12.394 --> 07:12.694
Of course.

07:12.734 --> 07:13.335
She shall call.

07:13.815 --> 07:14.616
She shall call now.

07:14.815 --> 07:17.898
to the Empress Amalia.

07:18.539 --> 07:26.067
And she was, the Empress was married to the Emperor of Brazil, Dom Pedro II.

07:26.208 --> 07:37.700
And while this little princess is hanging here, it was a niece to one of our queens, Queen Josephine.

07:38.601 --> 07:43.827
And our Queen Josephine, who lived in the beginning of the 19th century,

07:44.549 --> 08:03.604
she inherited her sister Amalia and her daughter Maria Amalia's books so they are here so she's here because she was a book woman in a way well in a way she read a lot of books

08:03.871 --> 08:14.723
children books and sweet little youth books from her youth and she died in tuberculosis.

08:14.743 --> 08:15.624
Tuberculosis.

08:16.344 --> 08:18.286
You said her name was Marie-Emily?

08:18.827 --> 08:19.047
Yes.

08:19.247 --> 08:20.128
M-A-R-I-E.

08:20.148 --> 08:20.889
Or Brazil.

08:22.231 --> 08:22.471
What's that?

08:22.491 --> 08:23.572
Marie-Emily.

08:24.853 --> 08:27.697
Marie-Emily.

08:27.717 --> 08:28.157
Very nice.

08:28.677 --> 08:35.047
You are the representative of these books, you're not just a librarian.

08:35.427 --> 08:35.848
Yes, you are right.

08:37.310 --> 08:40.655
Now, I think we have seen this now.

08:41.356 --> 08:42.858
We have, yes, I think you should.

08:45.342 --> 08:45.442
Yes.

08:45.462 --> 08:46.925
Now we continue.

08:47.085 --> 08:48.527
And these we can get later, right?

08:48.627 --> 08:48.888
Yes.

08:48.988 --> 08:50.871
So I can leave these here then as well?

08:51.331 --> 08:52.573
Yes, you can leave it.

08:52.593 --> 08:54.516
And then we bring you to another table.

08:57.517 --> 08:59.399
Oh, these are beautiful.

08:59.419 --> 09:00.640
I can see right off the bat.

09:04.544 --> 09:05.185
Architecture.

09:06.126 --> 09:06.867
Drawings.

09:06.887 --> 09:07.267
Oh, look, Hader.

09:07.467 --> 09:08.949
Oh, yes, he's using maps.

09:09.469 --> 09:17.037
No, drawings of commerce vessels or ships.

09:17.157 --> 09:17.798
Maritone.

09:18.078 --> 09:18.398
Yes.

09:18.979 --> 09:20.220
Ship architecture.

09:20.240 --> 09:24.064
Ship architecture, and he is

09:24.382 --> 09:27.988
It was a gift to Oscar II.

09:28.008 --> 09:32.356
And this is a lovely picture of Stockholm.

09:32.877 --> 09:34.139
And here you have the palace.

09:35.922 --> 09:37.004
Here is the palace.

09:37.585 --> 09:40.389
The library wing is not shown here.

09:40.409 --> 09:41.832
It's just behind that house.

09:46.279 --> 09:48.243
That's very nice.

09:48.263 --> 09:49.545
Let me just bring that back a little bit right there.

09:52.462 --> 09:53.984
Shall I hold it for you?

09:54.144 --> 09:55.967
Actually, I think I got it.

09:55.987 --> 09:56.428
It's fine.

09:56.708 --> 09:57.069
Yes.

09:58.611 --> 10:02.376
And it's... I like them at an angle, actually.

10:02.396 --> 10:04.159
Yes, it's more interesting.

10:04.239 --> 10:06.082
It's from the Baltic Sea.

10:07.384 --> 10:15.516
And you know, at this time, in the middle of the 18th century, Sweden was quite rich.

10:15.536 --> 10:17.679
We went to... I just want to write down the title.

10:17.739 --> 10:18.740
Go ahead, you can continue.

10:18.981 --> 10:19.341
Yes.

10:20.563 --> 10:20.663
Okay.

10:21.352 --> 10:26.397
Cectura navalis mercatoria.

10:29.560 --> 10:32.323
Mercatoria is commercial ships.

10:33.664 --> 10:36.487
It's not Mercator, I see.

10:36.587 --> 10:38.449
I thought it was.

10:38.850 --> 10:42.053
By Federico Chapman, right?

10:42.073 --> 10:42.393
Yes.

10:44.075 --> 10:49.080
Henrik Henrikus.

10:50.056 --> 11:15.591
and what's here you have 1768 mdcclx that's right yes okay and then you have oh you know when the path was here some years ago

11:15.790 --> 11:19.334
And where should they place all his bishops?

11:19.634 --> 11:20.756
The Pope was in here?

11:20.976 --> 11:21.977
The Pope was here.

11:21.997 --> 11:22.658
In this very room?

11:22.698 --> 11:25.982
No, he was upstairs in the king's apartment.

11:26.863 --> 11:31.789
But the bishops, they thought, where are we going to place them?

11:32.509 --> 11:35.233
Oh, they asked me to show them the library.

11:36.234 --> 11:44.143
And I think they had a good time, and I showed them, well, they asked, oh, well, show us something, showcase, so...

11:44.697 --> 11:48.982
And I showed them this book, Queen Christina.

11:49.002 --> 11:52.225
And that must be her binding, right?

11:52.265 --> 11:53.066
Her binding.

11:54.648 --> 11:57.611
And it's Queen Christina with a C, right?

11:57.871 --> 11:57.991
C-H.

11:58.652 --> 11:59.293
Christina.

11:59.313 --> 12:01.235
Well, that is the Queen Christina.

12:01.255 --> 12:03.637
Exactly, living in the book.

12:04.578 --> 12:06.781
Oh, she's the Lady Bibliophile.

12:06.801 --> 12:08.463
Yes, the real Bibliophile.

12:08.483 --> 12:10.705
She's in my book, Gentle Madness, by the way.

12:10.820 --> 12:12.122
Oh, lovely.

12:12.202 --> 12:13.804
Yes, I love Queen Christina.

12:13.824 --> 12:17.529
Yes, and this is... The Bibliotheca Alessandra at the Vatican.

12:17.709 --> 12:18.950
Yes, exactly.

12:19.771 --> 12:23.336
Can you hear a little bit about what I'm talking about?

12:23.356 --> 12:27.441
Well, we all find our paths meeting, don't we?

12:27.521 --> 12:28.302
We do.

12:28.322 --> 12:31.626
Yes, and this book, Gustav Adolf VI.

12:31.947 --> 12:34.210
This is one of Queen Christina's books?

12:34.510 --> 12:36.793
Yes, in her private library.

12:36.959 --> 12:39.402
From the Cardinal Albergati.

12:39.462 --> 12:40.784
How did this get left behind?

12:41.805 --> 12:47.352
Well, it was, you know, all the manuscripts were put in.

12:48.113 --> 12:51.638
The Pope got it, and it's in the Vatican Library.

12:52.119 --> 12:59.428
But her books, she had a will, but after some hundred years, they have been sold.

12:59.909 --> 13:02.612
Her library has been sold to different persons.

13:03.588 --> 13:13.782
And it came to a Swedish collector, Viktor von Stedink, and he gave it to our late king on his 80th birthday.

13:14.163 --> 13:14.884
This book here?

13:14.964 --> 13:15.845
Yes, this book.

13:16.506 --> 13:18.449
Which I'm taking a picture of right now.

13:18.469 --> 13:19.731
So, do.

13:20.412 --> 13:24.037
Go ahead, I'm still listening.

13:24.077 --> 13:30.726
Be careful of the strings, it doesn't come into... And here's, the emblem here is

13:31.263 --> 13:35.449
But do you call it a chef or with some wheat?

13:37.072 --> 13:37.873
What do you call that?

13:38.995 --> 13:39.896
Well, I look it up.

13:40.176 --> 13:41.038
A chef of wheat.

13:41.058 --> 13:43.081
So you will have it correct.

13:43.241 --> 13:44.783
I didn't think of it.

13:44.803 --> 13:45.805
What do you call it?

13:45.825 --> 13:46.546
I will look it up.

13:46.606 --> 13:47.788
A Queen Christina book.

13:48.008 --> 13:49.430
That's very exciting to me.

13:50.312 --> 13:53.537
A Queen Christina book is coming back to Stockholm.

13:53.737 --> 13:58.384
But not now to the castle, but to the new built palace, in a way.

13:58.718 --> 14:05.466
But this book was never, no, this book wasn't here because it's printed in 1664.

14:05.966 --> 14:09.370
So she got it from the Cardinal Albergati in Rome.

14:10.271 --> 14:11.192
But it came back here?

14:12.333 --> 14:13.955
It was never here in the beginning.

14:14.415 --> 14:15.316
I have to change.

14:15.537 --> 14:15.897
Okay.

14:15.917 --> 14:17.999
Because she left in 1654.

14:18.360 --> 14:22.284
But nevertheless, it's a book of hers that came back.

14:22.304 --> 14:24.387
Yes, in a way back to Sweden.

14:24.407 --> 14:24.827
Yes.

14:25.769 --> 14:32.275
And another book here that was a gift to Gustav Adolf.

14:33.436 --> 14:35.939
Nothing special with it.

14:35.959 --> 14:37.040
It's of Walter Scott.

14:38.561 --> 14:40.163
Look at it, but it has a treasure.

14:40.503 --> 14:43.947
It has a hidden treasure, this book.

14:43.967 --> 14:44.507
It is?

14:44.867 --> 14:46.709
Yes, it has a hidden treasure.

14:46.749 --> 14:47.570
A hidden treasure.

14:47.990 --> 14:49.011
A hidden treasure.

14:51.554 --> 14:52.875
I have to show you.

14:53.195 --> 14:54.797
You'll have to show me because I don't want to.

14:55.368 --> 14:55.688
No.

14:56.650 --> 14:58.132
You look at it there.

14:58.152 --> 14:58.412
Okay.

15:10.929 --> 15:11.550
Oh my.

15:11.570 --> 15:14.354
A forage, a forage painting.

15:14.374 --> 15:14.454
Yes.

15:15.816 --> 15:17.819
And it is a forage, and what is the scene?

15:19.101 --> 15:23.046
It's from North Amberland, if you can read it.

15:23.448 --> 15:27.213
You have seen this before, but we just have this one in this library.

15:29.717 --> 15:31.520
It's Northamberland.

15:31.540 --> 15:33.723
Northamberland.

15:33.943 --> 15:34.364
Yes.

15:34.384 --> 15:35.525
Is that hand painted, do you think?

15:36.247 --> 15:36.667
Of course.

15:37.148 --> 15:39.171
It's the only way to do it.

15:40.032 --> 15:43.938
Because you have to have very... It's in from 1808.

15:46.141 --> 15:47.923
Printed in Edinburgh.

15:49.045 --> 15:50.407
Mr. Walter Scott.

15:50.487 --> 15:51.128
Yes.

15:51.148 --> 15:52.510
Mar... Mar...

15:53.418 --> 15:55.140
tale of flattened field.

15:56.061 --> 15:58.845
And we call this forage painting, I think, right?

15:58.865 --> 16:00.387
Exactly.

16:00.407 --> 16:01.789
Well, you have seen this before.

16:02.350 --> 16:04.693
I've seen forage painting before, yes.

16:04.753 --> 16:04.953
Yes.

16:05.514 --> 16:12.663
And to have a fine forage painting, you have to bind it very well.

16:12.744 --> 16:17.530
Like, in a way, it should feel like a brick.

16:17.550 --> 16:19.172
And I think it's very sweet.

16:22.223 --> 16:22.864
It's beautiful.

16:23.024 --> 16:27.169
Yes, it's very sweet.

16:27.309 --> 16:28.050
No, it won't.

16:28.170 --> 16:28.531
It won't.

16:28.611 --> 16:30.033
It's just for you to have a look.

16:30.633 --> 16:32.075
And Gustav Adolf.

16:32.756 --> 16:33.857
There's Gustav Adolf.

16:33.878 --> 16:34.238
Adolf.

16:34.478 --> 16:35.580
That's here.

16:35.820 --> 16:36.561
You have it here.

16:38.443 --> 16:38.663
Book plate.

16:38.683 --> 16:39.324
Book plate.

16:39.965 --> 16:41.988
Yes.

16:44.491 --> 16:46.493
Aha, it has a life on its own.

16:47.755 --> 16:51.960
And this book, Gustav Adolf bought in London.

16:52.480 --> 16:57.726
And he was interested not so much to read old books, but a lovely binding.

16:58.427 --> 17:00.028
He liked very much.

17:05.594 --> 17:07.416
Otherwise, we are... Oh, look at this.

17:07.537 --> 17:10.700
Yes, it's so beautiful.

17:10.960 --> 17:12.342
It's the Book of Common Prayer.

17:12.702 --> 17:15.165
Yes, and here you have the note.

17:16.346 --> 17:17.808
So here you can read about this.

17:19.189 --> 17:22.453
I think it's binding so lovely.

17:25.353 --> 17:28.397
He went to antiquarians and so on.

17:28.417 --> 17:30.340
So he bought this at a store?

17:30.360 --> 17:31.882
Yes, he, yes.

17:31.902 --> 17:33.884
The store is so, anyhow.

17:33.904 --> 17:34.705
London, 1684.

17:34.765 --> 17:37.589
It's a small a-dub.

17:37.609 --> 17:39.632
So this is actually the bookseller's description.

17:39.652 --> 17:40.373
Yes, exactly.

17:41.054 --> 17:43.978
And he has saved it in his book.

17:44.118 --> 17:44.859
I think it's good.

17:45.119 --> 17:47.542
It's a good thing.

17:47.562 --> 17:49.004
And he paid 60 pounds for it.

17:50.867 --> 17:52.609
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

17:53.753 --> 17:55.976
And what year I wonder he was?

17:55.996 --> 17:57.719
When he bought it, it doesn't say.

17:58.400 --> 17:59.221
But that's a lot of money.

17:59.923 --> 18:00.203
Yes.

18:00.864 --> 18:02.487
When was he?

18:02.507 --> 18:05.211
Because he was married to two English ladies.

18:05.251 --> 18:10.779
His first wife was Princess Margaret of Connaught.

18:12.682 --> 18:22.157
And when she died in 1920, he married Louise Battenberg, later Louise Mountbatten.

18:22.677 --> 18:24.119
Lady Louise.

18:24.139 --> 18:25.380
Could I get a Xerox of that?

18:25.400 --> 18:26.161
Yes, certainly.

18:26.341 --> 18:28.623
Instead of trying to write it down?

18:28.643 --> 18:28.723
Yes.

18:28.743 --> 18:29.925
They'd love this in Biblio.

18:30.725 --> 18:32.067
I thought so, yes.

18:32.447 --> 18:34.910
That's why I picked it out for your magazine.

18:35.050 --> 18:35.891
Yes.

18:36.251 --> 18:36.952
They would love that.

18:37.052 --> 18:37.813
Yes.

18:37.833 --> 18:40.916
Because this is a book collector monarch right here.

18:41.076 --> 18:41.337
Yes.

18:42.037 --> 18:44.560
In a way, in a way.

18:44.760 --> 18:46.382
He didn't send somebody to buy it.

18:46.562 --> 18:47.503
No, he bought it.

18:47.821 --> 18:50.466
And he thought enough to keep the discreet.

18:50.486 --> 18:52.670
But we don't have many others, you see.

18:52.730 --> 18:53.411
But you've got one.

18:53.792 --> 18:54.813
Yes.

18:54.833 --> 18:55.735
It shows that he cared.

18:56.176 --> 18:56.536
He cared.

18:56.576 --> 18:58.199
That we know.

18:58.420 --> 19:01.605
And his years, you told me the years of his reign, right?

19:01.625 --> 19:05.111
It was in 1950 till 1972.

19:05.131 --> 19:06.855
1950.

19:07.936 --> 19:08.277
So...

19:08.476 --> 19:10.739
When he bought that, at some time within that range?

19:11.059 --> 19:14.384
No, he could have, because he was born in 1882.

19:14.484 --> 19:16.627
Oh, so it could have even been before he was king.

19:16.647 --> 19:16.807
Oh, yes.

19:17.068 --> 19:17.628
We don't know when.

19:17.648 --> 19:24.718
As a king, he had no time, perhaps, but as a young man, he could start.

19:24.738 --> 19:26.320
And we don't know the bookseller either, right?

19:26.761 --> 19:28.523
No, we don't.

19:28.543 --> 19:34.731
Yes, I think we do, because he saved that.

19:36.534 --> 19:38.196
I think I have seen a little bit.

19:42.040 --> 19:45.705
Let me look.

19:47.187 --> 19:49.250
It's a beautiful little book.

19:49.270 --> 19:50.531
I have a feeling.

19:50.551 --> 19:53.996
I saw a little brown piece of the envelope.

19:57.601 --> 19:58.742
Now, where is it?

20:02.167 --> 20:04.090
But if it's not there, then we don't know, right?

20:04.110 --> 20:05.632
There's no record to indicate.

20:05.652 --> 20:06.974
No, no, no, it doesn't.

20:06.994 --> 20:07.875
No, it's not here.

20:09.437 --> 20:10.759
Because we saved everything.

20:10.799 --> 20:11.760
Okay.

20:15.790 --> 20:17.133
It's a nice little start again.

20:17.313 --> 20:18.635
Just imagine Strindberg.

20:19.156 --> 20:23.605
Yes, yes, just imagine Strindberg here in 1870.

20:24.106 --> 20:35.267
Running up and down with moon stars, steps, looking for new books and...

20:36.091 --> 20:43.701
to read and really have a fantastic material for his novels and theater places and so on.

20:43.721 --> 20:45.023
And what do we call this area?

20:45.063 --> 20:48.327
This is... It's the second gallery.

20:48.428 --> 20:50.891
Or the middle gallery.

20:52.113 --> 20:53.174
The bottom, the middle.

20:54.055 --> 20:55.377
And it's to the north now.

20:55.657 --> 20:59.603
And it's a kind of a magazine.

20:59.623 --> 21:00.964
A store for a book.

21:01.906 --> 21:03.668
You see, they are less beautiful.

21:04.171 --> 21:26.820
in a way oh these are quite far done and we have the court calendar from russia in 1917 the last court calendar so oh look at that yes look at it beautiful yes

21:27.897 --> 21:33.285
Well, you say these are the less striking ones, but there are still some rather beautiful books here, though.

21:33.745 --> 21:34.667
Yes, never mind, these are quite nice.

21:36.589 --> 21:49.548
Oh, well, you know, they want to give the most beautiful gift, not only a nice book, or interesting book, but it can be bound in a beautiful way.

21:49.568 --> 21:52.312
Okay, so we are going up on another floor, actually.

21:52.332 --> 21:56.217
Yes, now we are coming up to the upper gallery,

21:56.534 --> 22:18.357
and we will enter what is what is that body of water out there this water is the mingling between the lake and the Baltic Sea it's a running water and now it's very calm but just a little some hundred meters away to the west

22:18.556 --> 22:43.703
you have an enormous big lake so we're looking out on i'm just thinking of what these windows are looking out on on the lake or the volcanic sea and opposite us is the opera house they now give norma bellini and uh so what's the name this is this is where the lake what's the name of the lake i will put it on maybe you can write it

22:58.145 --> 23:03.851
And you will have it, it's close to the carpet.

23:03.911 --> 23:04.471
Really?

23:05.092 --> 23:06.513
The same lake.

23:06.854 --> 23:18.045
And here we have, well, fiction literature.

23:18.065 --> 23:18.385
Fiction?

23:18.405 --> 23:21.629
Yes, a lot of fiction for Oscar II.

23:22.349 --> 23:28.135
Dreambird's work had been bought by his librarian.

23:28.672 --> 23:35.238
And, of course, Oscar II was very upset with what Strindberg wrote about, you know.

23:35.479 --> 23:38.221
But Strindberg wanted to upset everybody.

23:39.222 --> 23:40.704
It was his idea.

23:41.244 --> 23:42.746
He still got his book.

23:42.766 --> 23:43.927
He took about his books, though.

23:44.407 --> 23:46.269
Yes, yes.

23:46.329 --> 23:48.371
He was interested.

23:48.391 --> 23:50.693
So here's why... This is pretty remarkable.

23:50.994 --> 23:57.700
Yes, and it's here where Strindberg remembered in a madman

23:58.253 --> 23:59.254
Manifesto.

24:00.896 --> 24:02.237
The first chapter.

24:03.238 --> 24:05.881
The first chapter.

24:06.441 --> 24:12.367
This is going to be... No, it's too dark.

24:12.728 --> 24:16.051
It must be... We'll try it.

24:16.171 --> 24:18.413
Yeah, for your memory.

24:20.696 --> 24:22.578
And here you have the Queen.

24:22.598 --> 24:25.881
So here you have Queen Desiree above.

24:26.553 --> 24:29.558
Her consort.

24:29.578 --> 24:32.883
Above her husband.

24:33.023 --> 24:33.143
Okay.

24:33.704 --> 24:34.545
Yes.

24:34.565 --> 24:44.661
So the literature here belonging to the queens are actually like pearls in a crown because they have picked their literature themselves.

24:45.442 --> 24:49.628
They have had time to read their books.

24:51.051 --> 24:53.995
The kings, of course, are also reading persons.

24:54.599 --> 24:59.485
But they don't have so much time for it, unless you're time.

24:59.906 --> 25:04.011
Now, these are the queen's books, and you say the consorts are down there?

25:04.031 --> 25:15.305
Yes, and then the next king, after the provenance princess, Oscar I, and his queen, Josephine.

25:19.350 --> 25:23.796
King Charles XV, after Oscar I,

25:25.953 --> 25:29.376
but it's on these pages.

25:29.436 --> 25:30.918
From our palace library.

25:30.958 --> 25:31.638
That's excellent.

25:31.658 --> 25:32.639
So I don't need to write that down.

25:32.659 --> 25:35.602
And behind us we have a Vasa collection.

25:35.642 --> 25:43.009
It was, and you know, our king was brought away, the son of Gustav III.

25:43.610 --> 25:52.538
But he brought his father's books, and he bought books abroad when he was staying in Switzerland.

25:53.219 --> 25:55.521
And it came back by a will here.

25:55.957 --> 25:58.821
to the royal palace.

25:58.841 --> 26:02.186
I will show you some of the books.

26:02.206 --> 26:02.526
Okay.

26:04.890 --> 26:06.011
This is quite remarkable.

26:07.854 --> 26:08.134
It really is.

26:09.496 --> 26:16.246
It belonged to Gustav III, and it says Faga.

26:16.326 --> 26:17.187
H-A-G-A.

26:17.508 --> 26:18.469
Exactly.

26:18.489 --> 26:20.953
It was placed at the little palace, sir.

26:21.574 --> 26:23.536
That's on the back of the binding.

26:23.556 --> 26:23.877
Yes.

26:23.897 --> 26:24.698
And what does that mean?

26:25.927 --> 26:27.048
This.

26:27.990 --> 26:28.911
Yes.

26:28.931 --> 26:32.556
Haga is a name where he lived.

26:32.736 --> 26:37.542
He had a little palace there for his summer visits.

26:37.562 --> 26:39.845
Otherwise, he stayed here in Stockholm.

26:39.866 --> 26:41.287
But he put that device on that.

26:41.367 --> 26:43.791
Yes, because he had it placed there.

26:43.811 --> 26:46.394
Of course, it's a long one.

26:46.414 --> 26:48.998
A lexified.

26:49.018 --> 26:50.159
Yes, a dictionary.

26:50.620 --> 26:51.361
Latino.

26:52.042 --> 26:52.723
Svecanum.

26:54.405 --> 26:55.326
Latino, yeah.

26:55.897 --> 26:58.701
In Swedish, Latin Swedish.

27:03.649 --> 27:05.411
Excellent.

27:05.752 --> 27:10.239
You see, the marvelous page is so beautifully printed.

27:10.699 --> 27:11.761
What was the year on that?

27:12.322 --> 27:15.667
Yes, look, trying to find out.

27:16.448 --> 27:17.189
1790.

27:18.271 --> 27:19.933
That's a very early dictionary, isn't it?

27:20.614 --> 27:24.520
Quite early and a half for being here in this library.

27:27.031 --> 27:28.653
I mean, dictionaries aren't all that old.

27:29.234 --> 27:31.637
Well, perhaps.

27:31.657 --> 27:32.317
You were right.

27:33.379 --> 27:35.822
That's about when they were, I guess.

27:35.842 --> 27:36.683
When did they start?

27:38.505 --> 27:45.133
Well, Samuel Johnson was, you know, they was doing their dictionaries, but they're 18th century.

27:45.193 --> 27:46.695
I don't think they come before that, did they?

27:47.876 --> 27:51.060
I have not been thinking of them, actually.

27:51.080 --> 27:52.482
I mean, here's the...

27:54.132 --> 28:03.741
Well, the Swedish emblem, in a way, the small one, you know, with three crowns, belonged to Gustav III.

28:07.065 --> 28:09.167
And we are so lucky.

28:11.669 --> 28:20.578
And it belonged to Carl Gustav Tessin, one of the architecture of this library and this palace.

28:21.689 --> 28:32.845
but it's mentioned.

28:34.187 --> 28:35.168
And we are lucky here.

28:35.208 --> 28:38.613
You see, the bookbinder hasn't cut the pages.

28:41.858 --> 28:43.800
That's a little extraordinary.

28:43.981 --> 28:45.743
You have so much room here.

28:46.624 --> 28:48.507
But being...

28:49.702 --> 28:50.984
Handle it like this.

28:51.304 --> 28:53.527
It's a nicer binding in a way.

28:54.048 --> 29:02.759
Easier to look at.

29:02.779 --> 29:07.686
I think this is... We've done it.

29:07.706 --> 29:08.807
You have an idea.

29:08.867 --> 29:10.329
We've done it.

29:10.349 --> 29:11.270
We've done it.

29:11.311 --> 29:12.092
Yes, we have.

29:12.692 --> 29:15.456
Here's your colleague.

29:19.874 --> 29:20.835
Don't apologize.

29:22.737 --> 29:24.359
You know, the acoustics here are wonderful.

29:25.120 --> 29:25.200
Yes.

29:25.220 --> 29:34.851
For the sake of my tape recorder, let us say we are up on the gallery, the balcony, and I heard you from the other part of the room say you've made an appointment for me.

29:38.435 --> 29:39.917
Do they ever do musicals?

29:40.077 --> 29:40.858
Certainly.

29:40.938 --> 29:42.861
Benjamin Brinton has been here.

29:42.881 --> 29:43.541
Of course, why not?

29:43.661 --> 29:46.725
Yes, why not?

29:50.047 --> 29:50.628
I'll be there.

29:50.668 --> 29:54.476
Excellent.

29:55.839 --> 29:56.320
Excellent.

29:57.643 --> 29:58.004
Excellent.

29:58.024 --> 29:58.745
That's marvelous.

29:58.766 --> 29:59.166
That's good.

30:03.856 --> 30:06.602
I will be able to write his name down before I leave.

30:06.642 --> 30:08.125
Yes.

30:08.306 --> 30:09.388
We will.

30:13.452 --> 30:14.533
I'm feeling much better.

30:14.874 --> 30:17.537
I think it's the adrenaline, the excitement.

30:17.557 --> 30:19.840
I have drugged.

30:19.860 --> 30:20.801
You have been drugged.

30:20.821 --> 30:21.482
What do you call that?

30:21.702 --> 30:25.587
Well, I've been drugged by books.

30:25.827 --> 30:26.548
I'm fine.

30:26.568 --> 30:27.209
You are fine?

30:27.229 --> 30:27.830
Yep.

30:27.850 --> 30:35.659
Yes, go.

30:35.679 --> 30:37.141
This is all oak, right?

30:37.581 --> 30:39.243
All oak.

30:39.263 --> 30:42.227
The shelves are also oak shelves.

30:42.764 --> 30:47.851
So they can carry these very heavy books bindings.

30:48.332 --> 30:49.454
They have to be strong.

30:51.016 --> 30:52.358
I will show you down there.

30:52.458 --> 30:54.962
See, the architects knew they were making a library.

30:54.982 --> 31:00.089
They weren't simply making a thing of beauty, they were making a thing of function.

31:01.451 --> 31:02.012
Do I have it?

31:02.212 --> 31:03.635
Oh, you have it.

31:05.758 --> 31:09.804
So you found the words for it, really, really.

31:11.166 --> 31:12.147
That's my job.

31:21.610 --> 31:22.651
You say it's ridiculous.

31:22.671 --> 31:23.972
We've been working here so long.

31:24.172 --> 31:25.053
Yes.

31:25.073 --> 31:27.035
And why is it ridiculous?

31:27.556 --> 31:35.243
Well, I mean, if you want to make a career, you should always change an area where you change every now and then.

31:35.343 --> 31:37.325
But this is so nice.

31:37.465 --> 31:42.250
And it's very, I would feel like a mother leaving her children.

31:43.871 --> 31:45.373
It's too nice.

31:45.933 --> 31:47.495
Agreeable is probably the word.

31:47.655 --> 31:48.696
Agreeable, yes.

31:49.416 --> 31:49.957
Lovable.

31:50.117 --> 31:50.577
Lovable.

31:50.778 --> 31:51.178
Yes.

31:51.648 --> 31:59.202
And I was just mentioning to your colleague, this was not just built for beauty.

31:59.463 --> 32:02.910
There's actually a simplicity to it, but it was built for function.

32:03.230 --> 32:12.087
The wide, carrying the big books down the stairs, you know, falling down.

32:14.260 --> 32:14.981
What did you just say?

32:15.241 --> 32:16.704
Yes, please.

32:17.966 --> 32:28.622
We want some copies of the Biblio magazine so we can give it to the king and queen and our press department.

32:28.642 --> 32:32.387
Stay there just the way you were with your arm like that.

32:32.427 --> 32:33.869
Well, the background is lovely.

32:33.910 --> 32:34.911
Yes, thank you.

32:36.253 --> 32:38.076
So are you, by the way.

32:38.556 --> 32:40.019
Well, you are your best.

32:40.059 --> 32:42.242
That's nothing like a good background.

32:44.011 --> 32:49.879
I love my daughter's little camera, but it doesn't recycle the way the professional one does.

32:49.979 --> 32:50.780
All right, smile now.

32:50.880 --> 32:51.561
I think we'll get it.

32:52.963 --> 32:53.664
Yeah, that's a good picture.

32:53.684 --> 33:00.854
Yes, and here, the view you see here is outside Copenhagen, and the fortress is Three Crowns.

33:02.896 --> 33:03.217
Yes.

33:04.018 --> 33:05.660
I'm sorry, are you saying this?

33:05.680 --> 33:13.731
Okay, well, we are going to the Swedish Academy Library, and the Swedish Academy was...

33:14.318 --> 33:21.526
made by our king, or founded by our king, Gustav III, in the 18th century.

33:21.827 --> 33:27.513
And their library is housed in a house that also contains the stock market.

33:28.014 --> 33:28.314
Really?

33:29.035 --> 33:39.086
And the house was already there, because the academy was going to meet in a house with a room big enough and warm enough.

33:39.106 --> 33:40.568
Would you hold this just for a second?

33:40.628 --> 33:41.189
Just keep talking.

33:41.249 --> 33:42.250
I want to take a picture of it.

33:44.997 --> 33:47.020
Go ahead, you can keep talking.

33:47.040 --> 33:51.486
Okay, this is the house, you know, the big house.

33:51.586 --> 33:52.387
That's where we're going?

33:52.607 --> 33:54.710
Yes, that's where we're going.

33:54.810 --> 34:00.498
I'm sorry, you're talking about Bruce Valle III, who was founding the academy.

34:00.518 --> 34:07.788
I can hold that for you.

34:08.769 --> 34:12.574
But the librarian will probably tell you the story of the Swedish academy.

34:15.693 --> 34:19.038
I've got a picture of that right there, that's beautiful.

34:19.058 --> 34:19.418
Isn't that lovely?

34:19.438 --> 34:19.799
Yes.

34:19.999 --> 34:21.201
That says Sweden to me.

34:21.602 --> 34:22.222
Okay.

34:24.666 --> 34:37.144
The statue here is of Mr. Olofs, the scholar, or you could say the priest.

34:37.512 --> 34:42.177
who made Reformation in this country.

34:42.297 --> 34:47.322
The followers of Martin Luther King.

34:47.342 --> 34:47.662
This right here?

34:47.682 --> 34:47.822
Yes.

34:47.842 --> 34:52.046
He was the one who brought Reformation into the country.

34:52.066 --> 34:56.510
And Strindberg's first drama is called Mr. Olof.

34:56.631 --> 34:57.191
That's him.

34:57.511 --> 34:58.232
Right here.

34:58.252 --> 35:00.154
I'm going to take a picture right here.

35:00.174 --> 35:01.756
Shall I take a picture of you and him?

35:02.336 --> 35:03.477
Would you mind?

35:03.577 --> 35:03.958
Okay.

35:06.600 --> 35:07.401
Let me shut this up.
