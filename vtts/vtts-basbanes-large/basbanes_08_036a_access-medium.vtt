WEBVTT

00:02.866 --> 00:17.727
So why don't you pronounce your name for me so I can... Petro Popescu is speaking to Nicholas Basbains?

00:17.847 --> 00:18.188
Yeah.

00:18.388 --> 00:18.508
Right.

00:18.809 --> 00:20.912
Are you French by Greek?

00:21.493 --> 00:21.613
Yeah.

00:21.633 --> 00:22.854
Oh, you're one country over.

00:22.935 --> 00:25.298
That's amazing.

00:25.438 --> 00:28.503
It's just perfect right now.

00:28.523 --> 00:30.966
But how do you pronounce your name?

00:31.435 --> 00:32.616
They're true for places.

00:32.636 --> 00:34.399
That's just the way it looks.

00:34.479 --> 00:36.261
That's the way it looks.

00:36.281 --> 00:39.885
So you came from Romania about 20 years ago, I guess, right?

00:39.925 --> 00:40.966
No, actually, less than that.

00:41.547 --> 00:46.653
I came from Romania about, I defected about 15 years ago.

00:46.854 --> 00:55.384
And I went to the American Film Institute in Los Angeles as a student, the directing client.

00:55.404 --> 00:56.465
I'm just going to put this here.

00:56.645 --> 00:58.067
And I wanted to...

00:59.380 --> 01:05.691
I wanted to direct movies, which I did, and on the way I wrote screenplays, two things happened.

01:05.791 --> 01:13.945
I found out that I am a much better, which I knew, I had published books before, but I found out that I liked much better writing books than directing movies.

01:15.007 --> 01:21.658
And the second thing, during the screenplay writing period, I had a massive

01:22.229 --> 01:24.733
experience with social America, so to speak.

01:24.753 --> 01:33.687
So my knowledge of English, of the lived English language, got to a point where I had my confidence back to write fiction.

01:34.007 --> 01:35.129
I remember that moment.

01:35.249 --> 01:37.072
It was an extremely wonderful moment for me.

01:40.156 --> 01:46.947
Your specialty obviously seems to be to develop out of exploration, films of exploration and discovery.

01:47.327 --> 01:50.312
You have a previous film, which also involves

01:50.798 --> 01:53.763
That was Amazon Beaming, but that was non-fiction.

01:53.783 --> 01:57.730
That was the true story of a man who discovered the source of the Amazon River.

01:57.810 --> 01:59.874
Well, this one is a complete invention.

02:00.135 --> 02:06.546
I understand, but nevertheless, it seems to be charmed or taken by it.

02:06.526 --> 02:10.870
Tell me a little bit about the premise of this book.

02:11.270 --> 02:20.379
The premise of the book is the what if, and what if... Are you going to have anything for you?

02:20.399 --> 02:23.201
I had this this morning, but... Can I take a minute, please?

02:23.221 --> 02:25.944
Sure, just coffee for me is fun.

02:25.964 --> 02:29.407
Actually, how about a blueberry muffin?

02:30.168 --> 02:35.132
I know that there are, in various parts of the planet, habitats that

02:35.365 --> 02:40.993
have not changed very much for the last few million years, either in weather patterns or in flora and fauna.

02:42.074 --> 02:50.145
And there are habitats like that pretty much along the equator, some in Africa as well.

02:50.806 --> 02:53.610
So I asked myself, what if?

02:54.063 --> 03:06.368
there was a remaining packet of proto-humans who would be alive, but they would be the way they were two million years ago, which is not terribly far-fetched because

03:06.567 --> 03:14.094
There is one species that is the ancestor of apes, monkeys, and humans.

03:14.114 --> 03:16.456
That's the so-called tarsioids.

03:16.596 --> 03:19.719
They are considered to be the pre-monkeys.

03:20.080 --> 03:33.452
The ones that include the bush babies, the turtles, the lemurs, those animals that have extremely large big eyes at the front of the face, which is one of the first traits that started to separate hominids from the other mammals.

03:33.432 --> 03:49.817
I was accused that I pay an inordinate amount of attention to anatomy.

03:49.837 --> 04:01.414
In fact, in the New York Times, I was chastised for describing the size of the genitals.

04:02.592 --> 04:07.461
That was kind of a cheap shot because the production is extremely important.

04:07.541 --> 04:11.168
It was one of the most important factors in positive biofeedback.

04:11.188 --> 04:19.504
So anyway, finishing a very convoluted answer, the what if was, since we cannot see from satellites,

04:20.142 --> 04:24.048
individual specimens of any species.

04:24.088 --> 04:25.009
They're far too small.

04:25.130 --> 04:26.532
We can't even see herds.

04:26.632 --> 04:28.394
They don't register.

04:28.415 --> 04:35.425
It would be entirely possible if there was a pocket of hominy that would still be allowed for us not to know it.

04:35.445 --> 04:39.551
There are other species that we have not learned about until the last two decades.

04:39.972 --> 04:40.593
And they're everywhere.

04:40.613 --> 04:43.017
They're in the grasslands, they're in the forest, they're in the sea.

04:43.037 --> 04:46.622
They just found a mammal in Southeast Asia.

04:47.058 --> 04:49.781
Which is quite unbelievable to find a mammal.

04:49.841 --> 04:52.504
A picture of it in the New York Times.

04:53.245 --> 04:58.511
And then of course you think of the discovery of that Stone Age village in the Philippines.

04:58.551 --> 05:01.654
The Philippines, the Philippines.

05:01.674 --> 05:06.259
So it's not any possible.

05:07.500 --> 05:11.665
From the Watif started a lot of research on the plotting of the book.

05:11.645 --> 05:15.769
And then for the last three years, I kept writing it.

05:16.049 --> 05:38.631
And I certainly hope that I hit a vein of a wide audience interest, because at least it seemed that the book was sold so rapidly, which is very unlike my other books, that I said to myself, there must be here some sort of big mother load of public influence for whatever the reason.

05:39.134 --> 05:41.057
And now we're here sitting together.

05:41.257 --> 05:43.540
Do you think there's a movie here?

05:43.620 --> 05:44.020
Obviously.

05:44.501 --> 05:46.083
The rights to the movie were sold to St.

05:46.143 --> 05:46.864
John's Central Hope.

05:47.064 --> 05:54.214
I know there is a movie because I am a filmmaker and I can evaluate what makes a movie.

05:54.694 --> 06:00.262
Mine, in every suspenseful book, in every suspenseful novel, there is a movie.

06:00.322 --> 06:04.467
Whether that novel is about society, about the mafia, about prehistory, about

06:04.447 --> 06:12.539
relationships between men and males and females, anything that has good suspenseful plot is virtually a movie.

06:12.580 --> 06:16.065
But there would be a movie in this one, a big and expensive one, probably.

06:16.105 --> 06:17.407
It would be kind of fun.

06:17.427 --> 06:23.316
I mean, it would be, and of course, I think the theme of human nature, of course.

06:23.296 --> 06:32.152
I mean, you have these early creatures on one hand, but you also have the moving theme of human nature.

06:32.592 --> 06:33.113
Exactly.

06:33.133 --> 06:35.578
The theme of greed and all the other things.

06:35.598 --> 06:36.079
Exactly.

06:36.159 --> 06:40.326
I know fairly well the time people, because I used to teach clouds myself, and it's...

06:40.306 --> 06:43.911
It's not at all more moral than politics or than anything else.

06:43.991 --> 06:53.304
I mean, like everywhere else, there are individuals who are honest and there are individuals who are so driven by ambition that they don't have much sense of what exactly is the right thing to do.

06:54.305 --> 07:09.807
And part of the suspense of the book is obviously whether this breed will be protected from us, from the sapiens, if in the final analysis they will be allowed to remain what they are and not to be shifted in evolution by

07:11.170 --> 07:16.317
ourselves with our attention, our technology, all sorts of seeking ourselves upon them.

07:16.337 --> 07:18.981
And I want to reveal a lot about the book.

07:19.001 --> 07:19.682
No, no, don't worry.

07:19.842 --> 07:21.885
I don't do that either.

07:22.466 --> 07:29.836
Anyway, it was a complex, difficult book to write, and I had a lot of fun with it.

07:29.856 --> 07:34.002
I never expected that it will generate such interest.

07:34.143 --> 07:35.725
I'm extremely gratifying.

07:35.745 --> 07:37.988
It is interesting that it's simultaneous to this.

07:38.373 --> 07:42.853
There's another book out there, a Neanderthal book, which I haven't had a chance to look at.

07:43.134 --> 07:45.987
I'm just kind of curious that you have a similar kind of...

07:46.439 --> 07:52.686
Of course, your place in time is different from his, and it is a decidedly different story.

07:52.706 --> 07:54.467
But it is interesting.

07:54.487 --> 08:07.561
Well, if it indicates that a big cultural theme goes through the minds of many readers, and also of several writers, that can happen.

08:09.003 --> 08:11.265
To tell you the truth,

08:12.072 --> 08:21.205
This story that evolved in the past, that right behind my book there was another book that was beginning to somehow collect from the heat of the first book.

08:21.725 --> 08:32.038
I became, it's a great way to start being biased against a fellow writer, so I decided not to read this book now, but to read it later on.

08:33.040 --> 08:44.014
I was, in my mind, convinced that neither book, nor any book, is like another book, because if a book is good, I think there isn't anyone like it.

08:44.675 --> 08:50.803
In terms of the subject matter, it is, but this happens so often, you see one book come out,

08:51.408 --> 09:05.849
I was busy when I realized that when I realized that Primary Colors and Absolute Power by David Baldacci side-by-side on the personal list.

09:06.490 --> 09:07.432
That opened my eyes.

09:09.255 --> 09:10.857
So what can I say about that?

09:10.937 --> 09:12.960
I sure hope that

09:14.358 --> 09:20.213
I sure hope that the theme serves well in both books, or in as many books as there are in the market right now.

09:20.434 --> 09:27.793
Well, you know, that concern about what will be done with this group, I mean, that was the theme also of that actual Stone Age.

09:28.195 --> 09:31.721
that they could be in the Philippines.

09:31.921 --> 09:32.783
Will they be changed?

09:32.883 --> 09:34.305
Or should we keep them as a preserve?

09:34.365 --> 09:37.731
Or do we have an obligation to give them modern medicine and stuff like that?

09:37.751 --> 09:41.237
So there are all these ethical concerns.

09:41.457 --> 09:47.347
I met in the flesh tribal people in Africa and Australia and South America.

09:47.368 --> 09:53.578
I had experiences with Stone Age people who are not total human, admittedly, but who live nonetheless.

09:53.558 --> 10:17.338
at least 20 to 30 thousand years ago back in time and the anthropologists and uh the indian agents of the of the brazilian indian service that the the medics the the missionaries who fly in and out those sorts of tribal chiefs although they've been different by snakes to give them uh anti anti anti uh

10:18.820 --> 10:26.012
how do you say antipoison, antigenom, whatever, those people have an enormous

10:26.650 --> 10:36.623
an enormous moral dilemma, and I asked, I remember I asked once a missionary who used to fly, to fly people that were snake dip in an app, and he said, so how'd you solve that?

10:36.643 --> 10:47.678
He said, well, you try to solve it, you pass it in your mind, you're already in the plane, the propeller zone, this guy's heaving in the back of the plane, and you gotta take him someplace where you give him a shot, and you get him back to his life.

10:48.219 --> 10:50.963
So you don't solve the dilemma, you hopefully save the life.

10:52.044 --> 10:55.088
I don't know how we solve the dilemma.

10:56.080 --> 11:01.666
Again, now, did the idea for this novel begin when you were doing your last book?

11:02.026 --> 11:05.450
No, it became earlier than that.

11:05.470 --> 11:22.948
It came about 12 years ago when I was in Africa, in East Africa, and I was in a place that I got out of a compound at night and I started to hear basically the noises of a piece of savannah at night, which I fairly, first of all, especially the voices of sea lions carry.

11:22.928 --> 11:26.835
The leopards are grunting, the lions are sort of yawning.

11:26.855 --> 11:35.150
You can hear a lion belching and yawning a big distance in a savannah, especially if there is a little bit of breeze there.

11:35.170 --> 11:36.152
It can be really scary.

11:36.532 --> 11:38.376
You feel that they're right on top of you.

11:38.396 --> 11:40.038
Sometimes they're a few miles away.

11:40.059 --> 11:40.660
You can't see.

11:41.261 --> 11:43.705
So I had an incredible...

11:44.157 --> 11:47.402
an incredibly physical and concrete moment of panic.

11:47.963 --> 11:54.472
And in articulate awareness, my teeth are very small, my muscles are nothing by comparison.

11:54.632 --> 12:00.861
If I was chased by a lion or a bunch of hyenas or whatever, I would be just easy me.

12:00.881 --> 12:04.226
And that was the moment when I thought, how the hell did we get it together?

12:04.707 --> 12:13.540
That not only we survived, we displaced these enormously perfection killing machines instead of them displacing us.

12:13.520 --> 12:27.644
which I thought was a fabulously interesting question, but later on, after that, you start to read Richard Mitty, you read John Johansson, you read basically these are the classics in the field.

12:27.664 --> 12:32.693
Helen Fisher, they all ask the same question, and they have very interesting speculations, of course.

12:32.673 --> 12:38.887
And, of course, they all posit a missing link, too, which is, to a fiction writer, is very seductive.

12:39.047 --> 12:47.847
Entirely seductive, because it is mysterious, both in its name, and it gives you a certain latitude to invent, which is why I'm...

12:49.328 --> 12:53.136
I don't know what the scientists would say about this book if they wrote it.

12:53.256 --> 13:00.753
I hope that they have a sense of humor, because it was obviously an invention, and there are pieces where I stretched the reality.

13:00.793 --> 13:01.454
That's right.

13:01.554 --> 13:08.609
And it's not intended to be... I mean, it's an entertainment, I guess, fundamentally.

13:08.629 --> 13:09.852
I mean, you describe it as...

13:10.338 --> 13:22.364
It is described as commercial fiction, and I'm trying to accept the compliment.

13:22.384 --> 13:28.617
However, out in my mind was a little laughter when I was writing this book, and I keep on my desk

13:28.934 --> 13:51.297
a photograph of Joseph Conrad because through the years when I was basically trying to get English down as a real literary tool for myself it was very interesting to think about other people who wrote in English and it wasn't their language Conrad started to write in English when he was way past his thirties and he had a similar level for the tropics

13:51.277 --> 13:56.149
He also went to practically all the places where I went.

13:56.249 --> 14:07.918
He went because he was in the Navy, but nonetheless, the fascination of tropics and men against nature, men against wild solitude is a very big theme in both of us.

14:08.472 --> 14:15.745
In terms of the language, Nabokov did not write adventure stories, but obviously went from Russian to English.

14:15.785 --> 14:22.096
There was a Romanian, Eugene Yonescu, who went from Romanian to French, and they were all about four or five.

14:22.116 --> 14:27.707
I was fairly good friends with John Cheever at the time when I defected.

14:27.727 --> 14:29.670
In fact, John Cheever helped me to defect.

14:30.005 --> 14:37.224
John Cheever, John Ashbery, the poet, and a bunch of other people.

14:37.264 --> 14:38.688
Some I'm not here anymore.

14:39.370 --> 14:43.902
Howard Moss, who used to be with the New Yorker.

14:44.042 --> 14:46.208
I came to New York and I met

14:47.167 --> 14:52.775
of very large assortment of extremely distinguished writers.

14:52.795 --> 15:00.385
When I was part of the International Writing Program at the University of Ottawa, we also got all sorts of luminaries coming to visit and to talk.

15:00.405 --> 15:02.388
And I was puzzling and defecting at that time.

15:03.068 --> 15:10.879
With Chivo, with whom I was definitely on extremely friendly terms, I was not scared to be sincere with him.

15:11.230 --> 15:13.914
And I asked him the question, I said, what do you think I should do?

15:13.954 --> 15:15.757
And he said, it depends what you want.

15:15.837 --> 15:16.799
I said, I want freedom.

15:17.240 --> 15:20.785
I said, well, freedom and writing in English are not exactly the same thing.

15:21.587 --> 15:28.037
To be free is hard and dangerous in your case, probably, if you defect.

15:28.097 --> 15:30.521
They'll try to get you back this and that wish they did.

15:31.002 --> 15:32.404
But you do it.

15:32.424 --> 15:34.187
That's basically, it's feasible.

15:34.608 --> 15:37.272
Very many people have run away from dictatorship.

15:37.741 --> 15:44.168
Very few people who wrote in English from another language, four or five guys as far as I know.

15:44.969 --> 15:52.076
And he said, so you have to think whether you want to take the fourth gamble because you may not be able to win the second.

15:52.777 --> 16:02.787
And it was extremely helpful that someone so smart put the question in such concrete terms for me.

16:03.357 --> 16:29.533
anyway so i i decided that i will try here we are the first gamble was much easier of course to win than the second one but apparently i've won the second one finally i think so so it took a few years though it took a good few years absolutely and uh it's not for one to work i wrote i wrote piles of things piles of things that uh were not or were rejected by publishers

16:30.222 --> 16:48.842
Not because of the language issue, as a matter of fact, but because some of them were on commercial, others were sort of combinations of the older writer that I was, who had a far less daring vision about what he wanted to write about, and the writer that I was becoming.

16:48.882 --> 16:50.526
So it was a long translation.

16:50.962 --> 16:53.627
Tell me a little bit about your life in Romania.

16:54.669 --> 16:58.958
I was a best-selling writer in a small nation.

16:59.539 --> 17:10.000
I was extremely young and I was writing extremely explosive fiction and making extremely insidious movies against the regime.

17:09.980 --> 17:16.729
And my last novel in Romania was published with 100 pages excised by the censorship.

17:16.749 --> 17:19.372
So as of 450 pages, you knew the 100.

17:19.873 --> 17:22.256
That was pretty... And it was indiscriminately pulled out?

17:22.276 --> 17:23.577
It wasn't indiscriminately.

17:24.198 --> 17:27.643
I managed... There were chapters... You had edited it or they did the editing?

17:29.044 --> 17:30.927
This was my fourth novel.

17:31.007 --> 17:33.310
What was the title of it translated?

17:33.350 --> 17:36.314
The title translated was God's Children.

17:36.874 --> 17:39.818
And the...

17:41.654 --> 17:50.727
Forgive me, it wasn't God's word, it was Burial of the Vine, and Burial of the Vine was the English title, and Burial of the Vine was later published in England.

17:50.767 --> 17:53.852
It was published in England during my first year of the fiction.

17:54.513 --> 18:05.710
And that book, by the time that they published that book, I was an extremely popular author, so the censorship was somewhat more polite, somewhat more civil with writers who are not.

18:06.150 --> 18:11.458
And they said, very simple, you're not going to be able, you're not coming out to these chapters, period.

18:12.502 --> 18:19.862
And there was a negotiation, which I lost, but I was allowed at least to edit.

18:20.129 --> 18:45.833
the book in such a fashion that reading it you wouldn't see gaping holes and the book was that was one of the the strongest books that that i published uh in romania it was it was a romanian vessel it reached a hundred thousand copies which is an enormous print in a country of 25 million people but that country had no television the way we have it in america people could not travel

18:45.813 --> 18:49.619
So they were a captive audience in both senses of the time.

18:49.980 --> 18:55.529
They were captive to the system, they were captive to the few artists who were bearing within the system.

18:55.549 --> 18:57.933
And this was a contemporary novel.

18:57.954 --> 18:59.416
It was a contemporary novel.

18:59.436 --> 19:07.129
It was about the political situation and the anguish of the young generation seeing that they were stepping into a life that was entirely controlled.

19:07.548 --> 19:12.834
There was a love story that went on with it and whatever, but nonetheless it was a social novel.

19:13.355 --> 19:16.018
So you were known here as a writer?

19:16.219 --> 19:17.901
I was well known.

19:17.921 --> 19:22.086
No one invited to the international writing program of Iowa.

19:22.386 --> 19:26.431
Writers that were not notorious in their respective cultures.

19:26.511 --> 19:31.497
Everyone that came from Poland to Peru and from Greece to

19:31.730 --> 19:40.407
Canada, who were the ones who meant most at that time in their respective cultures, which was an extremely important society of peers.

19:40.487 --> 19:53.232
They were mentored locally by people like John Cheever and Paul Engle, who at that time was running the International Writing Program.

19:53.600 --> 20:01.952
I spent a whole academic year there, and funnily enough, I was the only one, or one of the few who was thinking of defecting.

20:02.513 --> 20:10.365
And basically all these other writers, there was a Greek writer who came from Greece at that time, was in the hands of the colonel Gentiles, and he was not leaving.

20:10.445 --> 20:17.896
And we had that conversation, and he said, look, you can't leave easily your language, but you can't leave easily the life you made.

20:18.437 --> 20:20.620
Everyone was like, more or less.

20:21.258 --> 20:24.882
more or less comfortable in what they have achieved.

20:24.902 --> 20:35.514
And I knew that that will change me enormously as a writer, partly because I wanted badly to go to the tropics and to stand where man became man.

20:35.614 --> 20:43.202
I had my own dreams about a sort of super science fiction kind of writing, about the sort of planetary meanings.

20:43.362 --> 20:46.526
And I was thinking of Conrad, I was thinking of H.G.

20:46.546 --> 20:51.231
Wells, who, in my opinion, in his time, just like me today, perhaps,

20:51.397 --> 20:55.607
was accused of being too much of a popular writer.

20:56.249 --> 21:01.742
And in fact, I think that some of his visions into modern society endure a lot better.

21:02.444 --> 21:03.767
He certainly... Go ahead.

21:03.787 --> 21:04.469
I'm sorry, go ahead.

21:04.489 --> 21:05.231
You go ahead.

21:05.251 --> 21:09.000
But Wells is a very interesting example because in his lifetime,

21:09.385 --> 21:16.901
He thought that his fiction was just entertainment stuff, and he really wanted to be recognized for his non-fiction, which of course today is totally forgotten.

21:16.922 --> 21:17.202
Exactly.

21:17.242 --> 21:24.458
And we remember him from the... Because we all are influenced by the judgment of our peers.

21:24.438 --> 21:35.553
And in all frankness, we don't like it when we get a bad review or when we think that we're reduced from what we wanted to say to the anecdote of it.

21:36.054 --> 21:47.509
So in a society like the England of HG Wells, which was a society that was extremely pretentious culturally, of course, Wells was, he had the public.

21:47.708 --> 21:51.318
who adored him then and kept adoring him since.

21:52.181 --> 21:59.502
And he did not have the nod of academe and of the Royal Society of Poetry.

21:59.522 --> 22:02.089
I think it still exists.

22:02.845 --> 22:03.606
What can I say?

22:03.706 --> 22:12.814
Edgar Allan Poe, who is the man that fascinates me, was accused in his time that he was too much... I don't know who wrote that.

22:12.894 --> 22:14.636
I think it might have been Bruce wrote his quiz.

22:14.656 --> 22:19.000
He said, well, he's two-thirds genius and one fudge.

22:19.380 --> 22:22.643
And that's too much fudge for a good writer or something like that.

22:23.323 --> 22:26.466
Well, the fudge meant... I'm sorry.

22:26.526 --> 22:29.969
I'm sorry to interrupt, but I don't mean... No, please.

22:29.989 --> 22:32.852
But now, you've made the transition 15 years...

22:32.832 --> 22:37.762
Do you write in English?

22:37.782 --> 22:43.694
The only thing that I do still in Romania is when I have to count fast from 1 to 20, I count in Romanian.

22:44.576 --> 22:48.644
And there are a few things that are reflex action.

22:48.664 --> 22:51.089
There are certain prayers that you say in your mind.

22:51.169 --> 22:52.532
You don't say them in English.

22:52.753 --> 22:53.895
You are too new.

22:53.875 --> 22:55.878
All curses, exactly.

22:55.898 --> 22:57.560
When I burn my fingers, I swear.

22:58.241 --> 23:00.103
But apart from that, I'm American-American.

23:00.163 --> 23:01.385
I have two American children.

23:01.805 --> 23:03.868
I'm the only one who speaks Romanian in my house.

23:05.510 --> 23:08.634
But the thinking... No, the thinking is entirely in English.

23:08.654 --> 23:09.615
The process is in English now.

23:09.635 --> 23:11.097
Yeah, absolutely completely.

23:11.177 --> 23:12.539
Was it hard to do for you?

23:13.880 --> 23:18.246
It was hard, but it was in stages, in the sense that

23:19.492 --> 23:22.637
With each book that I wrote that wasn't published, it became easier.

23:23.499 --> 23:42.890
With each screenplay that I wrote that was produced or not produced, living English as a dialogue, in terms of dialogue, indisputably screenplays teach you and force you to observe how people speak.

23:42.910 --> 23:45.955
People speak very interestingly.

23:46.323 --> 23:52.093
I was paid the compliment that for someone who was once a foreigner, I'm writing the dialogue.

23:52.634 --> 23:54.196
It was, thanks to film.

23:54.998 --> 24:10.564
So, well, if some people say, I've been, I've had reviews in which reviewers pointed very, very markedly and repeatedly that I am an active screenplay writer, as if that is so factual, makes me less of a writer or a girl.

24:10.584 --> 24:11.726
Well, how do you respond to that?

24:11.926 --> 24:12.347
You don't.

24:12.665 --> 24:28.210
you don't i think what you do you go on yeah i would think uh writing for film would be quite a challenge and would really teach you some very it's a big challenge first of all i respect these people this is a lot of this is very

24:28.477 --> 24:51.852
skills work the people who write for film you are entirely right you're entirely right the people who write for film and don't disappear after one after one product that's produced the people who write for film first of all have to be enormously smart film business is a business run by extremely smart people people

24:51.832 --> 24:57.739
These people are on occasion cynical about culture and about what they say.

24:58.259 --> 25:02.604
There are times when they're calculatedly uncrassy.

25:02.624 --> 25:03.806
That's very Hollywood.

25:03.826 --> 25:07.150
Hollywood is a great manipulator of culture and of people.

25:07.730 --> 25:13.117
Hollywood manipulates in terms of how the audience responds more than anything, but so does film.

25:13.697 --> 25:18.683
If film was not the science of telling a story through editing,

25:18.663 --> 25:26.254
which is an enormous way to tease the audience, to prepare it, and then not deliver right then, whatever.

25:26.996 --> 25:33.545
If you have been a film editor, film editors know how they can make out of material something that makes sense.

25:33.766 --> 25:41.638
So film is so capable in its manipulations that the people who make films can be very well calculated about the movies.

25:41.658 --> 25:43.721
But it doesn't mean that they're stupid.

25:43.741 --> 25:47.927
Oh, I don't think they're stupid, but... And I think the person who...

25:48.532 --> 26:01.908
elects to write for film also has to leave his ego at the door because you're working with a hundred people as opposed to... I've got to tell you, I mean, almost rise or fall with it, it's yours.

26:02.068 --> 26:03.249
Exactly.

26:03.369 --> 26:05.252
And I'll give you an example.

26:06.033 --> 26:10.658
Can't we get a little stronger love interest here or something like that?

26:10.638 --> 26:17.405
Well, the talk goes on more or less in those terms.

26:17.966 --> 26:25.654
The talk does not get too sophisticated, not too many 25-cent words in the film business.

26:25.674 --> 26:26.895
And I'll give you an example.

26:27.896 --> 26:36.625
There is a completed screenplay at this time, or a screenplay that approaches completion, at 20th Century Fox, based on understanding.

26:36.645 --> 26:38.367
I'm not the writer of their screenplay.

26:38.347 --> 26:45.535
It is easier for a studio, if they buy the rights to my book, to push around a hired writer than to push around the author of the book.

26:45.555 --> 26:54.405
It doesn't matter that I know everything about that subject matter, and this writer has to research, even though in many ways the research is all in my book.

26:55.246 --> 27:03.696
So, Hollywood is as respectful of writers as it is determined to use them on their own terms.

27:04.300 --> 27:06.724
A good friend of mine, Nick Gage, you know, Nicholas?

27:06.744 --> 27:07.705
Yes.

27:07.725 --> 27:10.049
Yes, I knew your neighbors, as a matter of fact.

27:10.830 --> 27:15.798
When they were doing the movie of his life, Lainey, you know, he was co-producer.

27:16.278 --> 27:18.221
You know, they wanted him to shoot the movie.

27:18.241 --> 27:18.842
He is Greek.

27:18.862 --> 27:20.405
Nick's Greek, yeah.

27:20.425 --> 27:26.494
I don't know if you know the story, but at the end he finds the... I said the movie, and I know that he killed his mother.

27:26.474 --> 27:27.575
Exactly.

27:28.056 --> 27:30.418
Well, in the movie, they wanted him to kill him.

27:30.438 --> 27:32.561
They said, but I didn't kill him.

27:32.581 --> 27:33.722
It doesn't matter.

27:33.862 --> 27:36.465
I remember that scene very well.

27:36.686 --> 27:42.572
The core of the scene was when the hero asks the killer, why are you alive?

27:43.153 --> 27:45.155
There's a charged emotional scene.

27:45.235 --> 27:46.196
It's a very good example.

27:47.017 --> 27:49.500
But they originally wanted him to actually kill him.

27:49.520 --> 27:51.362
And he said, no, but I didn't kill him.

27:51.382 --> 27:54.726
The truth is irrelevant to the...

27:55.229 --> 27:59.035
I mean, that's the kind of stuff that happens out there.

27:59.095 --> 27:59.896
Yeah, exactly.

27:59.916 --> 28:10.251
Which is why, despite the fact that novels are much harder to write, and they take longer, they necessitate everything.

28:10.292 --> 28:12.935
I mean, that's a harder way to live, writing novels and screenplays.

28:13.316 --> 28:13.957
Much harder.

28:14.017 --> 28:14.638
I don't think so.

28:14.956 --> 28:18.925
But it's far more to understand in terms of not being told what to do.

28:18.945 --> 28:20.528
But, you know, I mean, you look better.

28:20.548 --> 28:23.554
I tend to out there if you'd make it as a screenwriter.

28:23.635 --> 28:27.122
I mean, there is, I guess, the remuneration that goes along with it.

28:27.643 --> 28:29.387
I had plenty of linears.

28:30.025 --> 28:35.774
So you actually have benefited from your time in Hollywood?

28:35.794 --> 28:37.556
I did for several reasons.

28:37.576 --> 28:41.583
First of all, when I came to America, I knew America a little.

28:41.603 --> 28:48.974
And obviously the freshness of a new pair of eyes in an incredibly complex environment like America is a drug.

28:49.755 --> 28:57.687
I mean, I benefited from that, the fact that I was full of biological zest and whatever, and I had had cultural experiences on the other side that were interesting.

28:57.667 --> 29:00.872
I had a degree in computer literature and languages.

29:00.952 --> 29:04.277
I was from the universities of Bucharest and Vienna.

29:05.318 --> 29:07.221
In other words, I was not coming as a Grammy.

29:07.321 --> 29:09.604
I was not rocking at business.

29:09.624 --> 29:15.834
But nonetheless, the workings of this former advanced society were unknown to me.

29:16.394 --> 29:27.150
So in a way, there's nothing more like America and like the time in the future that America is reaching towards than the movie business.

29:27.333 --> 29:30.858
What do you hope that people take from you from the book?

29:30.898 --> 29:34.583
I would have left autographs.

29:34.603 --> 29:36.345
Yeah, we can walk the car.

29:36.405 --> 29:37.187
Do you mind?

29:37.207 --> 29:37.767
Not at all.

29:37.787 --> 29:38.468
I'm right down there.

29:38.649 --> 29:38.989
Not at all.

29:39.009 --> 29:41.312
This is a fascinating conversation.

29:43.115 --> 29:46.079
I wouldn't like it if you didn't do it.

29:46.539 --> 29:49.223
What do I want people to take from almost Adam?

29:49.777 --> 29:54.307
There's a bunch of things that I want to give a long list.

29:54.328 --> 29:58.277
First of all, what I want them to take is, of course, the adventure.

29:58.337 --> 30:05.794
I think that if the readers manage to see the wilderness through my eyes the way it was two million years ago in Africa,

30:05.774 --> 30:34.026
which is why i think that my book is entirely unique no matter what comparisons because it is in africa as far as i know neanderthal is based in the former soviet union and right it's nothing that that's not against a book but i think that africa in terms of of all of us is an enormously interesting place i think i i try to do it just as i have friends

30:34.006 --> 30:36.210
I have friends who are Africans from Africa.

30:36.230 --> 30:38.415
I checked myself with them as much as I could.

30:39.216 --> 30:41.441
And I used a couple of their names in the book.

30:42.403 --> 30:44.808
I want them to take that.

30:44.828 --> 30:55.930
The enormous, enormous emotion of us, the primates, coming out of the trees into a wide space.

30:56.416 --> 31:02.264
Unlike the forest, which is close and tightly knit and womb-like and whatever, the savannah is infinite.

31:02.945 --> 31:09.715
We're the only species that got out into the savannah on two lakes and survived.

31:09.775 --> 31:14.021
We're the only ones who could tilt their heads back and look at the sky and see stars.

31:14.421 --> 31:16.063
No, other animals look at the sky.

31:16.104 --> 31:18.968
The sky is there to rain or shine on them, and that's about it.

31:18.988 --> 31:20.670
To look at it with wonder, too.

31:20.750 --> 31:21.030
Exactly.

31:21.211 --> 31:22.553
To look at them with wonder.

31:23.474 --> 31:25.056
And I think that...

31:25.357 --> 31:30.944
what happened then is so enormously interesting and gratifying to think about.

31:31.445 --> 31:39.455
I think it would give us all a lot of... a sense of how, in fact, how successful the human race is.

31:39.635 --> 31:47.044
I think that... I think with growing up all sorts of things, but we are in the main

31:47.564 --> 31:49.789
an enormously successful race.

31:49.990 --> 31:51.674
Almost too successful probably.

31:51.794 --> 32:01.978
Sure, sure, but we've had other moments in our history when we sort of went through, we came to the brink of creating changes.

32:02.414 --> 32:10.386
And somehow we managed both to adapt to the habitat and the habitat managed to adapt to us.

32:10.426 --> 32:15.633
I don't think that the story of mankind is finished, not by a long shot.

32:15.673 --> 32:19.799
You know, really, when you think of the time frame, how far back history goes.

32:20.220 --> 32:20.440
Right.

32:20.420 --> 32:22.103
so infinitesimal.

32:22.123 --> 32:22.724
Yeah, exactly.

32:23.004 --> 32:24.026
5,000 years.

32:24.066 --> 32:26.049
I mean, recorded history, whatever it is.

32:26.870 --> 32:27.611
We have really nothing.

32:27.631 --> 32:28.192
That's nothing.

32:28.352 --> 32:40.592
There's someone wrote a comparison saying that if the whole history of mankind would be compressed to a year, the last 5,000 years of civilization will be the last five minutes of that year or something of that sort.

32:40.692 --> 32:41.353
If it's even that much.

32:41.373 --> 32:42.555
If it's that much.

32:43.276 --> 32:43.737
Right.

32:43.977 --> 32:47.102
But I think also your work out on the West Coast is also

32:47.453 --> 32:51.637
I'm suggesting that it's also helping to write very visually.

32:51.657 --> 32:55.060
When you do write, I think that's going to wish the book.

32:55.080 --> 33:01.727
That is a corollary to what you're saying, to see this landscape.

33:01.747 --> 33:04.370
Yeah, but I wrote visually all my life.

33:04.830 --> 33:10.716
And to be truthful with you, I have yet to write a character that I did not know in life.

33:11.116 --> 33:13.439
Of course, you combine them, you don't want to offend people.

33:13.859 --> 33:17.022
But I have not written about anybody that I did not know.

33:17.002 --> 33:29.957
And I slipped myself into my characters a number of times because basically I'm a super contradictory individual.

33:30.577 --> 33:38.446
I'm a very good example of an anxious guy who doesn't know what tomorrow brings and tomorrow brings surprises.

33:39.247 --> 33:43.532
And speaking of that, what are you doing next to embark on another?

33:43.512 --> 33:46.877
I am already working on another novel.

33:48.600 --> 33:54.009
I was told rather seriously by my agent not to tell anybody what it is about.

33:54.049 --> 34:03.564
He said, you've got a lot of high concepts and who knows, high concepts are very easy to rip off.

34:03.864 --> 34:10.515
I am working on another novel and it's again sort of planetary.

34:10.495 --> 34:12.640
Touch wood so far it has gone well.

34:12.720 --> 34:14.585
I don't know what will happen from now on.

34:14.665 --> 34:17.331
And do you have a contract with Mara for the next one?

34:17.391 --> 34:20.459
No, I do not.

34:20.780 --> 34:27.736
This contract was for one book and they have a right to look at my next book of fiction as is standard.

34:27.756 --> 34:28.538
I'm not...

34:28.518 --> 34:35.547
I'm not big enough, I'm known enough to go into three book deals the way other people do.

34:35.607 --> 34:37.209
Anyway, it's speculative.

34:37.570 --> 34:42.235
If it does well, you can get yourself an idea.

34:42.256 --> 34:43.357
Yeah, probably.

34:43.377 --> 34:53.149
All I hope is, all I want is that enough readers read it so that I get the feeling that this long, torturous road got me where I want to be.

34:53.189 --> 34:55.993
In other words, that I have a...

34:55.973 --> 34:59.136
an interchange with readers in America, which is really natural.

34:59.156 --> 35:02.239
I'm giving them something that other people don't give them.

35:02.720 --> 35:08.246
Do you now consider yourself an American writer?

35:09.147 --> 35:12.350
Realistically, I am an American writer.

35:12.370 --> 35:18.536
Specifically, I am an American writer with a very interesting personal story to tell.

35:18.556 --> 35:20.158
I was born overseas.

35:20.527 --> 35:31.941
I stationed in Europe and at the traffic and whatever else, and I'm over here at the age at which basically you want to start slowing down in terms of running around.

35:32.482 --> 35:38.970
I'm approaching my fifties, which is the best ripest time in fiction ripest, supposedly.

35:39.050 --> 35:48.542
So I'd like to slow down a little bit in terms of running around the planet and sit down and write the stories that I know and the people that I have met, who were very many.

35:48.944 --> 35:51.616
of very different cuts and sizes.

35:52.760 --> 35:58.465
It's funny, you know, I have to get another funny material.
