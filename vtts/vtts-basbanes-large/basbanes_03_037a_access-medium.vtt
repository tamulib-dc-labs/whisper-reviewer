00:02.714 --> 00:09.364
It's just the best out of comparison to what happens to books called Milton Friedman's style.

00:09.384 --> 00:10.846
Well, literary criticism.

00:11.287 --> 00:14.091
Your Amazon ranking this morning is 44.

00:14.111 --> 00:15.513
Oh, thank you.

00:15.613 --> 00:16.495
That's pretty remarkable.

00:16.555 --> 00:24.367
I mean, it is quite an observation, isn't it, that a work of literary criticism could resonate so much with the popular leadership?

00:24.387 --> 00:26.590
Just because of Mr. Dillon.

00:26.610 --> 00:28.553
Mr. Dillon, nevertheless.

00:28.955 --> 00:38.466
You are giving us a close reading of the poetry, and I'd like to just start, because I am writing for civilians, as we say.

00:39.667 --> 00:39.827
Please.

00:39.847 --> 00:43.992
Perhaps you could just give me an idea of what you regard close reading.

00:44.012 --> 00:45.133
What is close reading?

00:45.193 --> 00:52.802
What is a close reader of poetry, or any text for that matter, when they say that?

00:53.120 --> 00:57.845
I sometimes tell my students that it's easier to attend lectures than to attend to them.

00:58.346 --> 01:01.229
So we always spend the first meeting after we go to it.

01:01.730 --> 01:09.338
But my teaching here, we give lectures and we give sections, so the same people are then doing both.

01:09.659 --> 01:12.122
I take it it's a certain kind of attention.

01:12.382 --> 01:14.725
It's necessary for close reading, it's a certain kind of attention.

01:15.205 --> 01:17.828
If it's not cared for, it will sacrifice.

01:18.162 --> 01:25.431
some very, very important things, because I take it that there isn't any attention that you could ever give that would involve sacrifice.

01:25.851 --> 01:36.644
So for me, one of the things I keep coming back to is the idea that to do this is not to do that, and that, as Eliot says, however rich drama is as a form, is as a form.

01:36.664 --> 01:42.471
There are certain things drama gives up in order to be drama, and that's why you need Dante as well as Shakespeare and so on.

01:42.811 --> 01:47.697
So I take it close reading is predicated on...

01:48.757 --> 01:49.919
realization.

01:50.459 --> 02:05.600
That is, that unless certain ideas and convictions and wisdom are realized in the very words, then all you're talking about is an abstraction or a sketch and so on.

02:05.620 --> 02:11.148
So I take it the close reader's job is to help people notice things they otherwise wouldn't have noticed.

02:12.029 --> 02:18.358
I take it that artists are people who are very good not only at noticing things but noticing relations between things that they've noticed.

02:18.862 --> 02:22.867
And then the critic comes in as somebody who notices some things about that.

02:23.667 --> 02:35.941
We talk about Dylan, of course, being a poet of performance, and there have been obviously parallels made between Shakespeare and Dylan, and you've even suggested them yourself.

02:38.604 --> 02:40.887
Perhaps we could expand a little bit on that.

02:41.103 --> 02:47.590
Shakespeare, in his lifetime, so far as we know, never attempted to publish his own plays.

02:47.851 --> 02:50.133
He clearly wrote a performance.

02:50.153 --> 02:52.596
And I'm wondering, can we make that parallel with Dylan?

02:52.616 --> 02:56.120
Do you think it matters to him that people read his poetry as a text?

02:57.381 --> 03:01.546
I think Dylan doesn't want people to read them as poems.

03:01.706 --> 03:07.633
And in the book, I try to talk about the difference that it makes, not just that something is performance,

03:07.934 --> 03:14.441
because song is a different performing art from drama, and there's a difference that it makes that song is what it is.

03:14.561 --> 03:20.347
And I talk a little bit about different systems of punctuation, which sounds a very small thing, but T.S.

03:20.367 --> 03:24.831
Eliot was right to say that the difference between poetry and prose is that they're different systems of punctuation.

03:25.192 --> 03:26.333
They're not different media.

03:26.773 --> 03:27.975
They're not different genre.

03:27.995 --> 03:29.276
They have the same medium language.

03:29.316 --> 03:33.561
They're not different genre, because you could have a comedy that's in poetry or a comedy that's in poetry.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.022
They're different systems of punctuation.

03:35.457 --> 03:48.255
And song is itself, then, another different system of punctuation because it has melisma, that there's no equivalent in poetry or prose to what it is to sing long to rain.

03:48.315 --> 03:51.680
There's nothing you can do that's like to, ooh, re, eh.

03:52.241 --> 03:54.524
That is to spend the one syllable.

03:54.544 --> 03:56.808
So there's a root difference.

03:58.610 --> 04:05.380
The Shakespeare question is, I think, tricky and complicated, partly because Dylan himself invoked Shakespeare.

04:05.613 --> 04:10.941
Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells, talking to some French girl who says she knows me well.

04:11.542 --> 04:18.172
So the feeling of kind of comic camaraderie, and Shakespeare, Ophelia turns up, as you know, in Destination Row.

04:18.192 --> 04:22.138
I mean, he's very well read, it's well known, I mean, his own sort of joke.

04:22.979 --> 04:33.274
It's now questioned by scholars as to whether there was the clear-cut distinction between the page and the stage that we've taken for granted with Shakespeare.

04:33.575 --> 04:50.739
And there's a very good recent book that says that one of the reasons we have Shakespeare's plays in such different forms is that there was a move towards preserving them, not only a move by Ben Johnson, but also a move that gives us, as it were, unactively long versions of the plays.

04:50.899 --> 04:53.643
And it's been argued that this isn't... Unactively.

04:53.864 --> 04:57.188
Yeah, exactly.

04:57.308 --> 05:01.995
So that in a funny way, I think the Shakespeare case has been reopened lately.

05:02.279 --> 05:08.588
that we're used to saying he wasn't interested in whether they would be preserved on a page.

05:08.769 --> 05:11.573
Well, we don't really know very much about.

05:12.014 --> 05:14.718
Hamlet's advice to the players is always cut, for instance.

05:14.818 --> 05:15.619
Yes, that's right.

05:15.859 --> 05:18.764
You never see a full... If you say, let's do Hamlet in full, what do you mean?

05:18.784 --> 05:21.628
You mean everything from both?

05:22.229 --> 05:28.458
So to take it back, I mean, I argue in the book, I think song is a mixed media art.

05:28.939 --> 05:31.122
It's music and voice and words.

05:31.591 --> 05:41.586
I think that one is allowed to attend to the words, provided one does not forget that it is only part of the art, but then the same is true of Shakespeare.

05:42.607 --> 05:43.448
When A.C.

05:43.488 --> 05:52.201
Bradley writes about Shakespeare, he is writing as if Shakespeare, for the purposes of Bradley's noticings, exists on the page.

05:53.623 --> 05:57.649
So I suppose the question that keeps coming back for me is whether my way of getting at it

05:59.165 --> 06:15.109
very severely limits what I can show, which I think it does, or whether it vitiates what I'm doing, so that the people who are, as it were, hostile to the whole enterprise say, I'm sorry, the whole enterprise is vitiated by your attending to the words only.

06:15.129 --> 06:18.974
I think it's not vitiated by that, I think it is limited by that.

06:19.876 --> 06:26.185
But when you're in the vicinity of somebody who is really good, I mean, if you're in the vicinity of genius, whatever you do is limited.

06:27.076 --> 06:34.063
When you talk about, you suggest, and it has been documented clearly from his work, that Dylan is very well-read.

06:35.044 --> 06:37.086
Would you like to know what his reading habits are?

06:37.226 --> 06:39.088
I mean, or do you know?

06:39.208 --> 06:43.452
Is this something you define from a close reading of the text?

06:43.472 --> 06:47.216
Well, one of the key texts for this is Tarantula.

06:47.556 --> 06:50.919
That is, Tarantula is a very mixed bag, as a book-become-novel.

06:51.600 --> 06:56.965
The bits of it that are very good are the mocking letters, which come at regular intervals.

06:57.248 --> 06:58.951
And a lot of them mock education.

06:59.011 --> 07:00.573
A lot of them have learned jokes.

07:00.653 --> 07:02.296
A lot of them have allusive jokes.

07:02.416 --> 07:07.764
I mean, jokes about Walter Scott and about Jane Eyre and about Shakespeare and about Eliot.

07:08.204 --> 07:11.049
April or so is a cruel month.

07:11.609 --> 07:19.982
It's a good thing to do with Eliot because it messes up his rhythm in just the same way in which he liked messing up people's rhythm, for instance, Goldsmiths.

07:20.283 --> 07:27.152
And because it raises an interesting question about why can you say noon or so, but you can't say April or so?

07:27.172 --> 07:28.774
I mean, they're both units of time.

07:29.154 --> 07:30.656
Why can't you say April or so?

07:30.676 --> 07:32.879
So that, I mean, there's a sort of wit at work.

07:32.919 --> 07:36.904
So Tarantula is a terrifically allusive book.

07:37.004 --> 07:40.348
It is full of very funny literary jokes, all the way through, jokes about E.E.

07:40.408 --> 07:40.809
Cummings.

07:41.509 --> 07:44.813
And, of course, Dillon has given interviews in which he does talk about his reading.

07:44.854 --> 07:46.976
There was a very good recent interview in the L.A.

07:46.996 --> 07:47.657
Times.

07:48.008 --> 07:50.110
in which he talked about, he said that he read the poets.

07:50.130 --> 07:53.934
When he was young, he read the poets in the way in which people now read Stephen King.

07:54.555 --> 07:56.197
And he explicitly said John Donne.

07:57.078 --> 08:01.022
Now, I've been jeered at for mentioning John Donne.

08:01.082 --> 08:04.366
It's rather nice to have Dylan mentioning John Donne.

08:05.287 --> 08:14.657
So that world is a world which, I mean, it often suited that world to mockingly go a bit down market.

08:14.857 --> 08:21.794
On the other hand, Dylan is a singer who's talking about love troubles, sings that might have been like Verlaine or Rambeau.

08:22.295 --> 08:25.383
Now, you can say there's no reason to suppose he knows anything about Verlaine.

08:25.704 --> 08:29.473
Who do you think you are, as it were, to suppose that he knows nothing about Verlaine and Rambeau?

08:29.808 --> 08:33.012
It's a wonderful rhyme of Rambeau with, you're going to make me lonesome when you go.

08:34.073 --> 08:45.346
When you go to France, I mean, Verlaine of Rambeau, I mean, but, I mean, he, there's a lot about, there's a lot of jokes about poetry and writing, you know, read all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books.

08:45.686 --> 08:56.238
Why should we think he, why should we think he holds the song Day of the Locusts and doesn't have any idea that there was a Nathaniel West book that had that in the plural instead of in the singular?

08:56.659 --> 08:57.840
So, so you've been, apparently,

08:58.124 --> 09:00.186
interested in Dylan for close to 40 years.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.910
1965 was the year I read when you were out at Berkeley.

09:03.070 --> 09:03.951
Yeah, that's right.

09:03.971 --> 09:04.972
And I was insufficient.

09:05.052 --> 09:09.918
And then I'm contrite about having been snobbish.

09:09.938 --> 09:14.984
I mean, the English are not more snobbish than Americans, but we're differently snobbish.

09:15.284 --> 09:22.172
And I think it was stupid to me in 65 to suppose that people who told me Dylan was good were sort of slumming.

09:22.793 --> 09:26.157
Well, at what point did you think that you were encountering genius?

09:27.453 --> 09:28.675
By 68, I knew what I was.

09:28.835 --> 09:29.095
Really?

09:29.255 --> 09:29.716
Yeah.

09:30.777 --> 09:39.328
It's just, I mean, I've talked about this in some, the good questions that you ask are questions that have been put to me, as it were.

09:39.749 --> 09:47.078
But I think the moment when you know that something is really good is when there's this double process of gratitude.

09:47.339 --> 09:53.967
You're grateful to the song because it illuminates something about, say, a person you're in love with.

09:54.537 --> 09:58.622
And then you're very grateful to the person you're in love with, because it really illuminates the song.

09:58.942 --> 10:07.552
So there's this lovely, what I think of not a vicious circle, but a beautifully virtuous circle, by which you, as I do with Robert Graves' poems.

10:07.652 --> 10:13.839
Dylan is set in one of the biographies to have met Robert Graves, and not actually to have sort of really hit it off with him.

10:14.360 --> 10:17.043
But Graves' poems have that very beautiful applicability.

10:17.063 --> 10:18.925
You read a Graves' love poem, and you think,

10:19.343 --> 10:21.906
very strange that he sort of knew this about me, really.

10:22.346 --> 10:23.467
I never met him.

10:23.527 --> 10:32.637
Yeah, to go back to the Shakespeare parallel, I mean, one of the things that really dazzles people about us regarding Shakespeare is that he never attended university.

10:32.657 --> 10:37.061
Of course, that's one of the arguments that these people try to give, that he couldn't be Shakespeare.

10:37.081 --> 10:40.084
How did anyone so well-read have not attended university?

10:40.945 --> 10:43.748
And, of course, Dylan is a

10:44.082 --> 11:02.403
There's a dropout, too, and it just continues to dazzle that people could be so well-read, and not only so well-read, but to understand, even more than to assimilate this material into a proper way.

11:03.024 --> 11:10.613
I think the story in the past is... I think you bring up an important point there at a slightly different angle, that is that

11:10.897 --> 11:19.728
Our supposing that higher education has a monopoly of serious education would have seemed to people in the past to be very, very strange.

11:19.808 --> 11:32.965
And it's still the case, as you know, that far fewer people, proportionately, go to a university in England than in the States, but that doesn't mean that they have left school, left their schooling, less well educated.

11:32.985 --> 11:38.592
There are complications, aren't there, about how... I mean, I was the first member of my family to go to a university,

11:38.858 --> 11:41.442
But my father was well-read.

11:41.462 --> 11:43.465
So there were always books around?

11:43.485 --> 11:44.166
There were books around.

11:44.186 --> 11:45.829
The lending libraries were wonderful.

11:46.230 --> 11:52.319
The Workers' Educational Association, which wasn't just for workers, it was really for the bourgeoisie, mostly, was very good.

11:52.359 --> 11:59.030
The BBC, in the great days of the BBC, took literature and culture really seriously.

11:59.190 --> 12:02.335
I mean, I remember hearing when I was 20...

12:02.905 --> 12:06.530
This serious talk on Shakespeare's sonnets on the radio, and that's fifty years ago.

12:06.570 --> 12:10.535
You're going to hear a serious twenty-five minute talk about Shakespeare's sonnets now.

12:11.215 --> 12:18.504
So there were things that stood in the place of what we now think is provided only by university education.

12:19.546 --> 12:26.955
The Eliot remark about Shakespeare being the sort of person who could absorb more in, as it were, a mourning,

12:27.155 --> 12:29.940
than the simply scholarly mind can do.

12:30.140 --> 12:33.626
I mean, how can Shakespeare have that time for North's Blutarch?

12:33.986 --> 12:40.056
He didn't have that much time for North's Blutarch, but he just went right in on the speech about the barge.

12:40.437 --> 12:45.284
He goes right in on certain moments with this extraordinarily absorbing power.

12:45.385 --> 12:48.690
I said once that Dylan was like some wonderful sponge, and then I was told,

12:49.025 --> 12:51.549
There's a cartoon character, something called SpongeBob.

12:51.669 --> 12:54.233
This was very tactless of me.

12:54.473 --> 12:55.354
I didn't know about it.

12:55.374 --> 13:04.968
But there is this extraordinary ability to just get what you need, a terrific sense of what fosters your own insight into life and so on.

13:05.429 --> 13:09.134
And that's not... Dr. Johnson talked about ripping the heart out of a book.

13:09.555 --> 13:14.442
There's a certain kind of person who either reads the whole of a book or can't get anything from the book.

13:14.776 --> 13:19.844
There's a different propensity, which is just to go in really extraordinary and just find the pen.

13:19.864 --> 13:36.750
Alberto Eco told me that's exactly how he has 30,000 books in his home, and he said, you know, there are books that I can tell you I haven't read, but yet in the process of picking it up and looking through it and touching it, we all know it's in the book, and certainly you've

13:37.085 --> 13:39.130
gotten things from it.

13:39.752 --> 13:43.160
You can read a book without actually reading it.

13:43.240 --> 13:47.831
It's a bad idea when reviewers do that.

13:48.573 --> 13:51.360
I had a review which said, why the seven daily sins?

13:51.420 --> 13:54.267
Why not something about faith, hope and charity?

13:54.247 --> 13:57.671
Actually, there are more than 100 pages of our Facebook page.

13:57.811 --> 14:00.493
Could you look at the contents page if you're reviewing this book?

14:00.534 --> 14:02.996
Please don't read it, but you might look at it.

14:03.256 --> 14:09.162
I guess what I was driving at, and if it seems like I'm not questioning you about Facebook, because that totally speaks for itself.

14:09.202 --> 14:10.644
Well, you do what you like.

14:10.684 --> 14:12.926
Please, of course.

14:13.207 --> 14:22.296
But I guess what I was driving at with the Shakespeare question is that we are so puzzled by him as an individual, because we know so little about his biography.

14:22.360 --> 14:26.344
And I wonder, are there things that puzzle you about Dylan?

14:27.044 --> 14:30.627
Yeah, I mean, I think... And I guess his biography as well as his art.

14:30.647 --> 14:31.829
Yeah.

14:31.849 --> 14:35.872
Well, I think remaining... What do I want to think here?

14:36.232 --> 14:41.637
I think artists are this extraordinary combination of being deeply private with going public.

14:42.158 --> 14:46.141
I mean, the artist is somebody who goes public with the most intensely private things.

14:46.602 --> 14:52.367
I think you can only do that if you do hold to certain intense privacies and reticences

14:52.988 --> 14:56.334
That is then different in an age of celebrity.

14:56.495 --> 14:59.721
I mean, Henry James foresaw everything that would happen to somebody like Dylan.

15:00.182 --> 15:14.229
I mean, his description of the great actress in The Tragic Muse is a description of the price that she will pay for being a celebrity and hope that she will be able to travel around the world and continue to act without being a travesty of herself.

15:14.309 --> 15:15.672
That's a whole world of celebrity.

15:16.073 --> 15:23.301
Now, I take it, I mean, I've got my 15 minutes not quite of fame, but of kind of being interviewed.

15:24.002 --> 15:32.290
I take it that the celebrity is like a cuttlefish and announces where it is in order to not be caught.

15:32.551 --> 15:36.855
So what you get is, Dylan's decision has been the opposite of Beckett's.

15:36.935 --> 15:42.081
Beckett is, don't give any interviews, and as he wonderfully said to somebody, no, not even for you.

15:42.247 --> 15:45.132
In any case, I have no views to inter.

15:45.933 --> 15:49.759
The idea that really an interview is living death, because it just inters your views.

15:50.099 --> 16:00.997
Dylan has done the opposite thing, which is terrific self-exposure, like Norman Mailer, and at the same time remaining extraordinarily unknown and mysterious.

16:01.037 --> 16:04.863
He might have really exposed himself, but how much has he revealed?

16:04.903 --> 16:05.844
Exactly.

16:06.465 --> 16:09.570
You expose yourself in order not to reveal yourself.

16:09.719 --> 16:13.222
And I think many of the things he says about this in interviews are rather touching.

16:14.344 --> 16:32.081
I have a very beautiful photograph at home taken by Carly, Simon's brother, Peter, and it's of Dylan from the back at the piano, and you look at him, and that's all dark, and you look out into a sunlit amphitheatre of gigantic size and so on.

16:32.762 --> 16:35.845
And Dylan is terrifically alone in this photo.

16:36.297 --> 16:37.919
So I don't know.

16:37.999 --> 16:49.232
I mean, it's clear that he fabricated a whole lot of stories about himself when young, rather as Andre Malraux did and as Henry Miller did.

16:49.252 --> 16:52.836
There's a whole world of Nin, all these people.

16:52.856 --> 16:59.064
You look into it and the discrepancies between the official accounts of what they were and were doing.

16:59.144 --> 17:02.808
So it's clearly early Dylan is doing a lot of covering his tracks.

17:03.068 --> 17:04.650
Does he have a sense, do you think, of...

17:05.423 --> 17:10.370
who he is, I mean, in terms of his place as a poet?

17:12.213 --> 17:12.854
I don't know.

17:12.874 --> 17:20.485
I mean, I think he's talked well in interviews about the dangers of self-consciousness.

17:21.126 --> 17:25.933
I mean, that is, in a way, about, how do I want to put this, even about the dangers of self-knowledge.

17:25.973 --> 17:29.959
I mean, we tend to say, know thyself, and that this is an aspiration.

17:31.722 --> 17:32.022
But,

17:32.255 --> 17:35.838
it's difficult to know things without becoming knowing about them.

17:36.759 --> 17:44.926
That is, just as we want people to be self-conscious, but not self-conscious, so we want people to know themselves, but not to suppose that they're knowable.

17:45.326 --> 17:48.910
I mean, I think, one of the things I hate in Rousseau is that he thinks he knows himself.

17:49.490 --> 17:52.333
I mean, he begins by saying that he really knows himself.

17:52.353 --> 18:00.079
I don't think he did know himself, but one of the things he didn't know was how unknowable you are, even to yourself, or especially to yourself.

18:00.099 --> 18:01.941
I mean, Proust is wonderful, isn't he,

18:02.073 --> 18:02.654
How?

18:02.674 --> 18:05.278
Who's the person you really want to deceive all the time?

18:05.679 --> 18:05.919
You.

18:08.002 --> 18:20.301
So that I think there's a certain kind of knowledge and self-understanding that Dylan would think comes between you and felicity, something that happens

18:20.500 --> 18:21.762
by a kind of chance.

18:22.102 --> 18:24.485
Remember, Dr. Johnson loves that term, felicity.

18:24.845 --> 18:26.648
A good effect in poetry is a felicity.

18:26.988 --> 18:33.356
It's something which falls out happily, which you couldn't will into existence, and which wasn't even the consequence of your own knowing something.

18:34.477 --> 18:40.965
Knowing that you would receive grace, I mean, I'm an atheist, but knowing that you would receive grace would, I think, be incompatible with receiving it.

18:41.806 --> 18:43.869
And the point about grace is you can't know.

18:43.949 --> 18:48.555
You better be prepared, if it arrives, to recognize it for what it is.

18:48.615 --> 18:49.596
But

18:50.032 --> 18:55.600
Keith writes beautifully about this, that it's as if his best things had been written by somebody else.

18:55.841 --> 18:57.183
He can't believe that he wrote it.

18:57.343 --> 19:00.628
And he says, I cannot conceive how I came upon it.

19:00.648 --> 19:02.371
You know, I did an interview with John Keegan.

19:02.631 --> 19:03.493
Oh, yes.

19:03.593 --> 19:15.090
And, of course, I asked him, and we all know The Face of Battle, of course, is this great book, and that's the one that he... And he said, that one I wrote, he said, I don't remember writing any of it.

19:15.110 --> 19:16.292
It's like I was in a zone.

19:16.627 --> 19:21.434
You know, just getting up and not realizing where it's coming from.

19:21.934 --> 19:22.736
That's right.

19:23.056 --> 19:29.946
It's kind of getting at that level, I guess, where there's just so much just... I think it's kind of what you're talking about.

19:29.966 --> 19:30.707
I think that's right.

19:30.787 --> 19:39.900
I mean, Keegan and I were at college together, I find an interesting thing, and I was very interested in his combination of, in a way, a military career with a not-military career.

19:39.940 --> 19:41.622
There used to be a military historian.

19:41.838 --> 19:55.856
and the relation of that to the physical challenge that he faced, which is very, very considerable, so that there's a kind of courage in him which could not be directly translated into battlefield courage, but life's a battlefield.

19:55.876 --> 20:00.302
Of course, he's invaluable to the whole military apparatus.

20:00.402 --> 20:01.484
Yeah, absolutely.

20:01.524 --> 20:08.453
But the feeling that inspiration has something to do with not knowing,

20:09.175 --> 20:16.908
We remember Blake, though they are not mine, I call them mine.

20:16.968 --> 20:19.953
Now, what do you mean, though they're not mine?

20:20.053 --> 20:25.282
Well, because you don't really know what goes to the making of them.

20:25.422 --> 20:31.292
I mean, Dylan, the three concerts that he gave recently in Boston, he ended every night with All Along the Watchtower.

20:32.474 --> 20:34.778
He came back to the first verse of it.

20:35.078 --> 20:42.191
So as you went out into the night, you heard him singing, not with complacency at all, none of them along the line know what any of it is worth.

20:43.834 --> 20:45.156
And that's also remarkable about himself.

20:45.176 --> 20:47.761
I mean, if you say, do you know what it is worth?

20:47.861 --> 20:51.788
The answer is, you have to say, no, I don't know what it is worth.

20:52.229 --> 20:54.092
My songs lead their own lives.

20:54.673 --> 20:57.458
And to know what your song is worth would be to deny them.

20:57.826 --> 21:01.552
this right to live their own lives.

21:01.893 --> 21:02.974
They're beautiful, I think.

21:03.275 --> 21:09.105
I asked Helen Vendler a couple weeks ago, how in her view does something become canonical?

21:09.425 --> 21:12.049
And she said other writers.

21:12.891 --> 21:14.854
And I wonder if you'd agree with that.

21:15.275 --> 21:17.118
Well, I'd agree and disagree with it.

21:17.138 --> 21:23.428
I think that the pound is right to say that the greatest form of criticism is always subsequent creation.

21:23.999 --> 21:33.626
That's not, I think, true of the performing arts, because the greatest form of criticism of a performing art is a performance, so that it will forever be different.

21:33.686 --> 21:36.253
I mean, the rich criticism of a Shakespeare play is a production of it.

21:36.571 --> 21:50.109
even what Zola and Balzac and Dickens do with Shakespeare is not in the end as crucial as criticism as a production of it, because it was through productions, etc.

21:50.129 --> 21:51.991
So I think Pound's right about that.

21:52.292 --> 22:05.329
I think the bit where I disagree perhaps with Helen, though perhaps not with you, is the word canonical, in that it seems to me what that word immediately does is locate importance in the university.

22:06.271 --> 22:09.715
Now, the university is now the most powerful patron that literature has.

22:09.775 --> 22:19.184
It's not good for the university, though, to be told or to come to believe that being the most important patron is the most important thing.

22:19.925 --> 22:21.126
That is canonical.

22:21.206 --> 22:25.030
I mean, nobody ever wondering whether to read a book says, is it in the canon?

22:26.271 --> 22:28.474
No decent human being ever thinks like that.

22:31.377 --> 22:32.818
The canon really means the syllabus.

22:32.967 --> 22:34.110
The canon really means it.

22:34.130 --> 22:36.275
When people say, is it in the canon, they mean, is it taught?

22:36.295 --> 22:39.603
Does the MLA authorize the teaching of it?

22:39.643 --> 22:49.366
On the other hand, when you hear that a university like Brown, a very distinguished university, or Amherst College, for English majors does not require the study of Shakespeare.

22:49.426 --> 22:50.368
One hopes that they would

22:51.277 --> 22:54.042
Well, I'm terrifically in favour of syllabi.

22:55.685 --> 23:03.059
Well, I'm terrifically in favour of having a syllabus, and one of the reasons I wasn't happy in Cambridge was that there was no syllabus, essentially.

23:03.640 --> 23:11.074
What that does is either mean that there's no... Well, because there is no common body of books that your students have all read,

23:11.375 --> 23:16.083
you have to study something which doesn't depend upon any particular book, such as narratology.

23:16.403 --> 23:36.876
That is, all novels are in some way in touch with narratology, so it doesn't make any difference whether you, Stephanie, have read Dickens, and Harriet has read Henry James, because narratology... So one of the reasons why theory arrived, or conquered for a while, partly because there was a war as to what books to study,

23:37.312 --> 23:43.559
And if you can't agree on what books to study, what you agree on is a form of study which doesn't depend on what particular books are.

23:44.000 --> 23:48.024
So that's why you can go to a higher, to a meta-matter.

23:48.425 --> 23:51.308
It still amazes me that a person can conceivably get a degree.

23:52.409 --> 23:58.176
I'm an English major, and not to demonstrate proficiency in Shakespeare.

23:58.196 --> 23:58.816
Well, I agree.

23:58.896 --> 23:59.697
I mean, I agree.

23:59.838 --> 24:01.159
I was, I mean...

24:01.780 --> 24:07.407
I was brought up with, of course, you had the first choice of Shakespeare, a choice of paper Shakespeare reference.

24:07.507 --> 24:08.609
Excuse me for going on up into this.

24:08.629 --> 24:09.650
No, no, no, it's important.

24:10.211 --> 24:18.521
But I think that's different from, I mean, art stays alive because of artists and the general public.

24:18.702 --> 24:21.125
The most important patron is the university.

24:21.525 --> 24:26.832
The university, therefore, has a way of saying art stays alive because of universities.

24:26.932 --> 24:29.155
Now, hang on, but it doesn't.

24:29.422 --> 24:33.948
Literature did not stay alive because of the church, though it would have died without the church.

24:34.329 --> 24:40.798
It didn't stay alive because of political regimes or because of privileged classes, though it would have died without patronage.

24:41.619 --> 24:49.270
The university, like all patrons, is blind in certain respects and generous in others, and certainly too proprietorial.

24:49.621 --> 24:54.266
So that people, you know, when Cynthia Ozick says that some years ago that, you know, that T.S.

24:54.286 --> 24:57.209
Eliot doesn't matter any longer, I mean, he isn't really taught anywhere.

24:57.249 --> 24:59.671
A, it's not true that he isn't taught anywhere.

25:00.052 --> 25:04.897
B, whether he's taught or not is not the only way in which people stay alive.

25:05.137 --> 25:09.321
And Geoffrey Hill's poems are alive with and against T.S.

25:09.341 --> 25:09.681
Eliot.

25:10.402 --> 25:15.267
It is true that there wouldn't be a book buying public if it went for University Patronage now.

25:15.427 --> 25:19.071
But publishers are kept solvent

25:19.321 --> 25:22.605
by the book trade at two universities.

25:23.586 --> 25:30.015
And I don't mean that nobody ever reads a book once they've left the university, but if you didn't... So this is where the patron is, and in the past it's been elsewhere.

25:30.235 --> 25:33.699
Now, I'm a charter member of the Association of Literary Critics and Scholars.

25:33.719 --> 25:34.340
Yeah, good.

25:34.460 --> 25:37.604
Yeah, look, ALSC conferences, right there.

25:37.624 --> 25:38.686
And very proudly so.

25:38.706 --> 25:48.278
And of course, I'm a journalist and not really a literary scholar at this, but nevertheless, I think it... Because I write for newspapers and magazines, and I write books about books.

25:48.298 --> 25:49.159
It's very important to...

25:49.696 --> 25:52.483
express where your allegiance is.

25:53.224 --> 26:00.561
And a lot of this did emerge from a conflict with the MLA, and where you really don't have a canon at all.

26:00.602 --> 26:05.072
Well, you see, the funny thing there is, I think,

26:06.065 --> 26:21.063
Because of the word canon... And the dead white European males, that whole... Yeah, I'm wondering to agree with you, but then importantly not to, too, because I think the trouble with using the word canon is that it sells the past.

26:21.965 --> 26:26.931
It's funny, the word syllabus was an honourable word because it was frankly pedagogical.

26:26.951 --> 26:31.296
The word canon is a dishonourable word because it comes over from sacred text,

26:31.883 --> 27:01.806
it, I think, attributes to a whole lot of texts which are sacred in my eyes, but are not sacred texts, a certain power, and it's a little bit like, I mean, people like you and me should not use the word ideology, and it's not that we disagree exactly that ideology's at work, it's just that somebody's faith is not the same as an ideology, and it isn't true that, I mean, when people talk about kind of, you know, Pascal's ideology, you want to say, see, Pascal had a faith,

27:02.039 --> 27:04.001
There's a creed that he credited.

27:04.422 --> 27:14.493
You can describe it as an ideology, and you wouldn't be wrong to see it under the aspect of politics, but to call it ideology is to say the most important aspect under which to see it is political.

27:14.934 --> 27:19.279
If you call it a creed or a faith, you say the most important aspect under which to see it is religious.

27:20.120 --> 27:25.586
If you call it a canon, you say the most important context under which to see it is the university.

27:26.187 --> 27:29.751
Because my brother, who loves poems, is moved to tears by poems,

27:30.085 --> 27:35.190
Donald would never in a million years wonder whether to buy a book and ask anybody whether it was in the canon.

27:36.031 --> 27:40.155
He's going to say, are these poems really as moving as I've been told?

27:40.316 --> 27:43.199
But I totally appreciate that.

27:43.339 --> 27:52.108
But on the other hand, you see something like the Library of America, which is an attempt over the last 20 odd years to establish the American literary canon.

27:52.588 --> 27:57.153
I guess the play art is the... Yeah, but what were they doing?

27:57.173 --> 27:58.995
A hundred years ago, they didn't say canon.

27:59.296 --> 28:04.603
So you're not going to say that 100 years ago they didn't, you're not going to say Henry James didn't want to establish.

28:04.623 --> 28:06.165
Some of these books fell out of print, too.

28:06.205 --> 28:07.987
I mean, part of the effort was to bring them back.

28:08.467 --> 28:09.348
No, that's all true.

28:09.489 --> 28:13.854
And the word, hang on to put this, I feel about canons I do about liberty.

28:13.874 --> 28:15.716
You know, what crimes are committed in its name?

28:16.217 --> 28:18.219
I think liberty is a very good idea.

28:18.320 --> 28:19.241
I'm in favor of it.

28:19.501 --> 28:24.147
As soon as they start saying liberty, it's a little bit like Dylan, you know, rip down all hate, I screamed.

28:24.788 --> 28:28.392
Sorry, as he knows, if you scream it, you're not ripping down hate.

28:28.743 --> 28:37.514
You either say rip down all hate and acknowledge that you're in favour of screaming, or you say, we really must stop hating.

28:38.696 --> 28:40.138
But you say it, you don't scream.

28:40.558 --> 28:53.755
So it's funny how I think certain words really grant the terms to the other side.

28:54.241 --> 28:58.606
I mean, I think Helen Wendt was right to say, what matters most is what artists make of previous art.

28:58.686 --> 29:00.328
That's how art most stays alive.

29:00.408 --> 29:04.632
It's almost precisely the phrase that she used in that.

29:04.652 --> 29:08.777
But, but, but... Do you know how Cameron, for me, cuts across that?

29:09.057 --> 29:18.467
Because I think it cuts you off from the readerly instincts of the people who, in the end... Do you mind if I shoot a couple pictures, by the way?

29:18.507 --> 29:19.288
No, I don't mind.

29:19.368 --> 29:20.810
I don't like it, but I don't mind.

29:20.830 --> 29:22.872
Well, too soon, I mean.

29:22.892 --> 29:23.893
Go ahead, please.

29:24.363 --> 29:27.949
I'm married to a photographer and therefore don't mind being photographed.

29:28.249 --> 29:31.615
And you'll notice the calculated abstention from a photograph.

29:31.695 --> 29:34.059
And you know Splendor of Letters has no pictures in it.

29:34.920 --> 29:38.667
Because I figured a book that celebrates letters... Yeah, it doesn't need pictures.

29:38.687 --> 29:39.488
Well, that's very good.

29:39.548 --> 29:40.049
I like that.

29:40.069 --> 29:40.409
Thank you.

29:40.429 --> 29:43.314
I haven't noticed yet, but I'll... Don't mind.

29:43.334 --> 29:45.157
I'm just saying why you're talking.

29:45.398 --> 29:46.660
Please, shoot away.

29:48.443 --> 29:48.683
Sorry.

29:49.068 --> 29:52.872
But maybe we'll take a few more before I go to the books.

29:53.592 --> 29:59.198
And my wife, who's quite a good critic and editor, we work together with the pictures, anything that we use.

29:59.438 --> 29:59.778
Oh, yes.

29:59.918 --> 30:00.439
Not to worry.

30:00.459 --> 30:11.589
I now know, of course, about your writing, and I'm grateful for that, and grateful that you put me on to the TLS, which I might otherwise have missed.

30:11.669 --> 30:14.192
You speak of yourself modestly as a journalist, as it were.

30:14.492 --> 30:17.775
But where do you mostly appeal?

30:18.262 --> 30:21.842
I have a little syndicate of my own.

30:22.784 --> 30:25.027
circulates to about a dozen newspapers.

30:25.067 --> 30:28.991
At one point, I was about 30 or so at the Philadelphia Inquirer.

30:29.332 --> 30:30.934
And you've built this up over the years.

30:30.994 --> 30:37.462
I had built it up, and I had been a literary editor in Worcester, Massachusetts for 13 years, and then I became syndicated.

30:37.482 --> 30:41.306
At my height, I had 30 or so pieces.

30:41.547 --> 30:44.871
And now I do, well, I mean, because you lose them, and then it became so hard.

30:44.891 --> 30:45.952
And the world changes, too.

30:46.052 --> 30:50.277
And I was doing a weekly piece, and I wasn't able to write my books.

30:50.560 --> 30:52.302
And a week is a lot.

30:52.322 --> 30:52.543
It is.

30:52.603 --> 30:54.225
Every week you do one and then you go out.

30:54.245 --> 30:56.628
But I've been doing a lot of reviews for the L.A.

30:56.648 --> 30:59.673
Times lately, and it's been kind of fun.

30:59.693 --> 31:02.296
And that's been satisfying me, and magazine beats.

31:02.316 --> 31:05.160
But I really have been focusing on my books.

31:05.220 --> 31:06.322
Three books in three years.

31:06.402 --> 31:07.423
That's very good, isn't it?

31:07.443 --> 31:08.365
You must be very pleased.

31:08.485 --> 31:08.926
I am.

31:09.086 --> 31:09.867
I'm a late bloomer.

31:10.047 --> 31:12.991
I had published my first book when I was 52 years old.

31:13.011 --> 31:13.612
Oh, really?

31:13.632 --> 31:15.395
Gosh, that is unusual.

31:15.735 --> 31:16.957
George Eliot was pretty old.

31:16.997 --> 31:20.061
That makes sense.

31:20.868 --> 31:23.711
You know, this is kind of a softball question, but it's important.

31:23.931 --> 31:35.302
And I really add that the tentative title of my new book is Every Book It's Reader, which is a... You don't have to reach millions of people for a book to be influential and to be important.

31:35.622 --> 31:43.390
And I guess I really would like a statement or some thoughts about the continuing power of poetry to shape our lives.

31:43.430 --> 31:49.896
I mean, so many people would suggest that poetry, some people, I mean, the Philistines, to be sure, perhaps, but...

31:50.078 --> 31:57.449
That poetry doesn't matter, and I wonder if you could give me a general comment on that, and also how it shapes and continues to nourish your own life.

31:58.630 --> 32:02.576
There isn't, for me, a poetry-prose distinction along these lines.

32:02.596 --> 32:03.798
I know that for some people there is.

32:03.878 --> 32:10.648
I mean, that is, I think Helen, one of the disagreements I would have with Helen Wendler is that I think she believes all literature would be poetry if it could.

32:11.649 --> 32:17.217
I think that she's strangely... I know John Updike would probably be a poet if he would.

32:17.737 --> 32:26.346
It's published poetry, but if you ask him what the highest calling is, it would be the poet, as opposed to the novelist.

32:26.366 --> 32:31.792
And that particular sort of indoctrination or prejudice has kind of operated on a lot.

32:31.812 --> 32:36.477
I mean, that is an awful lot of writers who, I think even perhaps Beckett.

32:36.497 --> 32:38.499
I mean, Beckett started wanting to be a poet.

32:38.599 --> 32:42.423
I mean, he came, I think he's a much better poet at the end of his life than at the beginning of his life.

32:43.905 --> 32:45.887
Beckett's greatest works are not for me.

32:46.357 --> 32:47.238
poems.

32:47.258 --> 32:53.185
I mean, and I don't really then want to cheat with it by saying, but essentially that's because his prose is itself poetry.

32:53.205 --> 32:55.628
I mean, I just want to hold the differences of punctuation.

32:56.029 --> 33:05.220
His immense resourcefulness was not released, I think, except occasionally in poems, and it was in the prose.

33:05.300 --> 33:14.631
And that's something of a difference, because that prejudice, you know, I mean, Coleridge saying, you know, the words in the best order, poetry is the best words in the best order.

33:14.811 --> 33:15.672
Well, come on.

33:15.905 --> 33:19.210
Jane Austen was not working in an inferior medium.

33:19.730 --> 33:22.915
I mean, a medium isn't inferior to Keats' medium or Byron.

33:22.995 --> 33:27.842
It's the same, the medium is the same language and so on.

33:28.563 --> 33:43.144
The sort of conversations I get into with people now would have to do with asking them where they think their consciousness and their conscience come from

33:43.563 --> 33:47.449
if it isn't in large part from works of art.

33:47.930 --> 34:10.785
That is, when people say, wouldn't it be better if, and this is a traditional point about the church, if we sold all that we had and gave to the poor, instead of any money being spent by Boston University on its library, wouldn't it make for a much better world if we didn't spend money on books, we spent money on relieving people, you know, I mean, importantly in soup kitchens and so on.

34:11.322 --> 34:18.389
And the question that I then put is, but where do you think caring for poverty-stricken and anguished people comes from?

34:19.010 --> 34:22.374
I don't believe it's built into human beings to care.

34:23.275 --> 34:27.659
It's built into me to hate caring as an adjective.

34:28.820 --> 34:31.623
We're trying to create a deeply caring institution.

34:32.384 --> 34:33.285
There's something awful about that.

34:33.605 --> 34:39.912
But I think that caring, it's not just natural to human beings to care and to be magnanimous and to be compassionate.

34:40.128 --> 34:41.349
So where do these things come from?

34:41.369 --> 34:45.674
Well, they come either from people whom you love or from works of art that you love.

34:45.735 --> 34:46.656
I think Shaw is right.

34:46.696 --> 34:51.201
The next to personal conduct, the most powerfully influential thing, is art.

34:52.923 --> 35:03.695
It falls short of personal conduct in some respects as an influencer, and in other respects it goes ahead of personal conduct, partly because you can be influenced by those persons who are no longer around.

35:03.715 --> 35:08.481
I mean, the terrible thing about dead white European males was the opprobrium attached to the word dead.

35:09.052 --> 35:17.441
I mean, the white European male bit, I mean, it's not clear to me why being cloven instead of clustered necessarily makes you more dishonorable.

35:17.721 --> 35:20.184
That's the adjective that Tennyson's aunt used.

35:20.244 --> 35:21.565
It's really good, I think.

35:21.605 --> 35:25.069
She said she had never regretted being born cloven and not clustered.

35:25.870 --> 35:29.654
It's a beautiful way of setting up gender differences and so on.

35:30.014 --> 35:35.380
But dead, I mean, as if, you know, the wonderful thing is to be in conversation with people who are dead

35:35.697 --> 35:41.303
It has many of the advantages of conversation, and it's free of many of the disadvantages of conversation.

35:41.863 --> 35:43.745
It's got a wonderful disinterestedness.

35:45.807 --> 35:52.534
So that, I mean, for me, it would turn... And you do find yourself often in conversation, to use your... Well, yeah, I think so.

35:52.554 --> 36:02.785
I mean, one of the things that pleased me about the review in the New York Times Book Review of the book was that it said that I put the poems together and was interested in the way in which they spoke to one another.

36:02.950 --> 36:13.146
as it might be a done poem talking to a Dylan song, set them up so that they're sort of in conversation, which is different from saying this one is alluded to.

36:13.379 --> 36:23.429
That is, there is a kind of conversation, you know, if somebody says, come, madam, come, all rest my powers defy, until I labour, I in labour lie, there's a relation between that and lay, lay, lay.

36:23.609 --> 36:25.691
Come, madam, come, returns.

36:25.731 --> 36:34.159
It doesn't matter to me whether Dylan knows Dunn, though I'm interested to read his talking, when he talks about Dunn, I'm sort of pleased about it.

36:34.499 --> 36:40.365
But the belief that an analogue is not as interesting as a source,

36:40.750 --> 36:44.033
or a belief that a source is interesting only if it's an allusion.

36:44.133 --> 36:54.322
I mean, I love allusions, and I've written a book about allusion, but a source can be very interesting without being alluded to, and an analogue can be wonderfully interesting without being a source.

36:55.042 --> 37:00.547
That these two myths of the Flood exist in quite different cultures with so many features in common.

37:01.388 --> 37:03.670
So, I mean, that's all I haven't done.

37:03.690 --> 37:04.791
Well, tell me what I should say.

37:04.991 --> 37:10.656
You know, you were credited with being the midwife to the careers of Seamus Heaney, Philip,

37:10.805 --> 37:14.450
Larkin, I wonder if maybe you could talk a little bit about the role of the critic.

37:14.991 --> 37:18.355
Well, that was kind of somebody but was overstated.

37:18.436 --> 37:22.601
I think it was people wanting me to get elected to the poetry professorship.

37:22.621 --> 37:32.134
I'm very pleased to have reviewed Seamus Heaney's first book very favorably and to have reviewed his second book very favorably and in general to have continued to believe in his worth.

37:32.915 --> 37:39.124
I'm very pleased to have written probably the first essay that was written on Geoffrey Hill, not the first review of any of his books,

37:39.408 --> 37:49.478
But the first essay about him, which was in the London magazine a long, long time ago, I'm pleased to have written about Beckett when I was an undergraduate at Oxford in the mid-fifties.

37:49.899 --> 37:54.183
And that's not so early from Beckett's point of view, but it's pretty early from the world's point of view.

37:54.203 --> 38:00.590
I mean, you say pleased in terms also of recognizing the work and sharing his perception.

38:00.630 --> 38:01.491
Yeah, there was a nice feeling.

38:01.531 --> 38:06.816
And the thing I've done lately that has most pleased me in this way is this

38:07.167 --> 38:14.217
Victorian Irish poet, James Henry, whom I started reading only because I was tickled by his not being Henry James.

38:14.738 --> 38:19.264
So I took down this book in the Cambridge University Library.

38:19.284 --> 38:22.168
I was editing the new Oxford Book of Victorian Verse.

38:22.228 --> 38:36.027
I saw James Henry, took it down, published at his own expense in Dresden in the 1860s, presented by him to Cambridge University Library in England with the pages never cut, never opened.

38:36.665 --> 38:38.227
And this was to be so poignant.

38:38.287 --> 38:43.715
I think of this Victorian doctor sending his poems from Dresden.

38:43.735 --> 38:45.077
This is a wonderful story.

38:45.277 --> 38:47.320
And so I did this book of his poems.

38:47.340 --> 38:48.722
Every book it's reader, you see.

38:48.862 --> 38:51.646
Here's a book that was lying untouched.

38:52.427 --> 38:53.288
Unopened.

38:53.348 --> 38:57.734
And you happened upon it because of the... And he never had a season review.

38:57.814 --> 39:00.017
And he was never reviewed by anybody.

39:00.378 --> 39:03.302
He gets into the DNB as a Virgilian scholar.

39:03.322 --> 39:05.625
So it's not that James Henry was totally unknown.

39:05.791 --> 39:07.394
But he was in no anthology.

39:08.055 --> 39:10.319
Whatever the scale, he was in no anthology.

39:10.580 --> 39:14.066
And he's now in quite a lot of anthologies, because I brought out this edition of him.

39:14.327 --> 39:16.872
And there's something about thinking, and he's a lovely poet.

39:16.892 --> 39:18.595
I mean, you love the poems.

39:18.615 --> 39:21.340
I mean, they're very wonderful openings.

39:21.680 --> 39:27.411
One begins, By what mistake were pigeons made so happy?

39:28.066 --> 39:31.271
It's a wonderful, extraordinary view of the world.

39:31.632 --> 39:33.855
I mean, he's an anti-Christian poet.

39:33.875 --> 39:36.499
I mean, he's very devout in his human pieties.

39:36.639 --> 39:40.105
He thinks that paganism is wrong but isn't as bad as Christianity, at any rate.

39:41.647 --> 39:43.009
But by what mistake would he do?

39:44.572 --> 39:45.233
He's a lovely poet.

39:45.253 --> 39:47.997
So there's some sort of pleasure in having recognised something.

39:49.139 --> 39:52.504
Midwife is, though, terrifically overdoes it.

39:52.855 --> 40:00.243
And Larkin I wrote very favorably about early, but I'm nothing like the first generation of people.

40:00.283 --> 40:03.066
So how do you decide who you will read?

40:03.206 --> 40:09.954
And I mean read, of course, not only to enjoy, but to write about and to share your perceptions with.

40:09.974 --> 40:13.618
How does this particular alchemy change?

40:13.638 --> 40:16.341
Well, I think it's mostly luck.

40:16.401 --> 40:18.663
I mean, I go back to the idea of felicity.

40:18.943 --> 40:22.187
Something happens which is a happy happenstance.

40:22.538 --> 40:27.686
That is, in the case of... I mean, there's a felicity about just... How do you want to put it?

40:28.327 --> 40:40.565
If I'd been living in Oxford, as I did for ten years, instead of in Cambridge, as I did for ten years, when working on this anthology, I would never have read James Henry, because I would never have had stack access to the Bodleian.

40:41.046 --> 40:44.190
So this depended on... Now, in general, I'm against stack access.

40:44.811 --> 40:50.740
I mean, I think that... Well, yeah, I think Cambridge University Library loses a lot of books, and it doesn't know what it has.

40:51.057 --> 40:57.748
And there are all kinds of ways in which you lose something if you permit stack access.

40:59.651 --> 41:03.056
How many joyful discoveries have I made in the Widener library?

41:03.316 --> 41:05.740
No, there was a lovely thing that happened.

41:05.760 --> 41:07.523
That's right, we need them both.

41:07.563 --> 41:12.431
We need great libraries that have stack access, and we need great libraries that don't.

41:12.451 --> 41:18.280
I mean, for instance, one of the virtues of not having stack access is that you have servants who bring you the book.

41:18.580 --> 41:20.242
Now, that is an amazing saving.

41:20.542 --> 41:25.949
I mean, I simply write a slip, and that book will be in the upper reading room, the Bodleian Library.

41:25.969 --> 41:27.051
But you know what you're looking for.

41:27.591 --> 41:30.335
Yes, well, the price of... The serendipity factor is now gone.

41:30.815 --> 41:31.616
Yes, that's right.

41:31.656 --> 41:36.262
Well, I don't know whether all the princes of Serendip did well.

41:36.643 --> 41:42.650
I certainly don't think Salon has done terribly well as a country, if we're really going to get back to Serendip.

41:43.311 --> 41:45.874
But I think there is just a terrific lot of luck.

41:46.275 --> 41:47.997
Why do I...

41:48.432 --> 41:55.744
I happened to be in Paris on holiday at a time when Beckett had just published Watt in 1953.

41:56.285 --> 42:10.588
So I happened to pick up in the Paris bookshop in the Rue des Seines a numbered copy of Watt, which I bought for 25 shillings, because I read the first page and I thought, this is really weird and funny, and I will be the only person in the world who will have read it.

42:11.370 --> 42:13.393
A little empty brine.

42:13.576 --> 42:14.818
Now, but it's a pure fluke.

42:14.838 --> 42:17.782
I mean, I could easily not have been under the Rue de Seine.

42:18.182 --> 42:26.454
But these are the discoveries, and then, not to use the word canonical, but then there is the pantheon, certainly, of people who are at the core.

42:27.815 --> 42:28.556
Yeah.

42:28.577 --> 42:31.641
Well, trusting... And you must return to them often.

42:31.661 --> 42:33.003
You can recite them at will.

42:33.023 --> 42:35.005
Well, I can't really recite them at will.

42:35.386 --> 42:38.470
But, well, I think there are

42:39.209 --> 42:40.451
I don't know if it would be the same for you.

42:40.711 --> 42:41.953
There are people whom one trusts.

42:41.993 --> 42:49.064
I agree with Dylan that if you want somebody you can trust yourself, but I trust Eliot's taste.

42:49.644 --> 42:51.788
I think Eliot had extraordinarily good taste.

42:51.808 --> 43:02.263
Connoisseurship can easily become snobbish and wine tasting and a whole lot of prissy things, but in the end we're indebted to connoisseurs.

43:02.311 --> 43:05.655
I mean, Berenson had better eyes than I have.

43:05.675 --> 43:07.297
He was better trained to look at paintings.

43:07.378 --> 43:09.160
That's a word we don't use anymore, connoisseur.

43:09.180 --> 43:11.964
No, well, it's thought to be elitist.

43:12.144 --> 43:12.925
But it keeps a connoisseur.

43:12.945 --> 43:15.128
He didn't regard himself as a connoisseur.

43:15.148 --> 43:15.408
I'm sorry.

43:15.548 --> 43:16.149
No, no, that's right.

43:16.249 --> 43:19.393
And the connoisseur is the person who knows things, including knowing about.

43:19.413 --> 43:21.596
He recognizes and knows.

43:23.238 --> 43:26.402
It has an elitist tinge to it, unfortunately.

43:26.523 --> 43:27.864
Well, there is.

43:27.924 --> 43:30.748
The reason what one ought to do, I think,

43:31.083 --> 43:54.042
in arguing with people about that is not so much... I sometimes find it useful to remind people that in the areas that they really care about, they're absolutely used to the idea that this particular manager of this particular sports team had something which, if he were moving it somewhere else, you'd call commissorship.

43:54.462 --> 43:55.504
This person has

43:55.788 --> 44:06.507
really trained instincts and wisdom and knowledge all coming perfectly together in picking the Indian team or in deciding at what point you declare and so on, all those things.

44:07.389 --> 44:12.358
The general elitist competitiveness thing doesn't work at all in sports.

44:12.498 --> 44:14.742
Everybody knows that sports are elitist and rightly.

44:17.066 --> 44:18.268
You're looking for

44:18.434 --> 44:20.598
You're looking for an absolutely crack team.

44:20.978 --> 44:31.436
Why is it all right to have a crack team if they're playing basketball, but to think that the idea of a crack team in an English department... I think Lord David Cecil was right.

44:31.497 --> 44:43.918
I mean, I didn't like his aristocratic manner when I was at Oxford and young and so on, but he was right to say, poets are not racehorses, they do not run the one against the other.

44:44.573 --> 44:57.708
But on the other hand, Leavis was also right to think that you are trying to establish what the really great life-enduring things are, and that a lot of other things are footling.

44:58.309 --> 45:12.825
They're a waste of time, and it's not that you should read Henry James all the time, but you better be aware that not to read What Maisie Knew is to miss some extraordinary apprehensions about what divorce is and what children are,

45:13.058 --> 45:17.984
that you won't get from any number of sort of Kramer versus Kramer films.

45:18.004 --> 45:20.887
You know, you talk about Henry James, and he really is one of the great examples.

45:20.907 --> 45:28.016
When you talk about collecting and bibliophiles and following the flag, he really is a writer who straddles both.

45:28.396 --> 45:30.258
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:30.278 --> 45:38.087
The English tradition, and of course, he's a great, he's arguably one of the two or three great American novels.

45:38.188 --> 45:39.149
Yeah, I agree.

45:40.170 --> 45:41.091
And has so much

45:41.577 --> 45:51.406
Well, let's do this question first, because you said you're the first one in your family to graduate from university.

45:51.426 --> 45:52.487
Yeah.

45:53.568 --> 45:57.372
And you said there were books in the home, but can you describe for me what happened?

45:57.492 --> 46:07.321
I mean, what absolutely happened in your life that you became so... I hesitate to use the word obsessed.

46:07.922 --> 46:11.145
Well, I... With poetry and...

46:11.767 --> 46:13.970
I was at a boarding school from 8 to 18.

46:14.010 --> 46:25.047
The first chapter of Jane Eyre, in which somebody tries to protect herself by reading a book, I think it's the greatest first chapter of any novel I've ever read.

46:25.067 --> 46:28.011
I think it's an absolutely perfect opening chapter.

46:28.031 --> 46:37.285
I think it is so touching, it's so full of understanding of parental, and especially sort of foster-parental, and

46:38.108 --> 46:41.156
difficulties, sibling rivalries, and so on.

46:41.176 --> 46:46.411
And she wanted to tuck herself in behind the curtains on the window seat and read.

46:46.591 --> 46:47.554
And she's not going to be allowed to.

46:47.594 --> 46:49.700
And the book is thrown at her as a weapon.

46:49.720 --> 46:53.350
Good books are weapons.

46:53.785 --> 46:56.828
Samuel Johnson knocked a guy.

46:56.868 --> 46:58.290
Is it Lauder?

46:58.410 --> 46:59.671
Is it Lauder?

46:59.772 --> 47:02.515
I'm trying to remember.

47:02.535 --> 47:09.002
He was supposed to be doing a translation and he went up and he said live air and he stood on his neck.

47:09.022 --> 47:11.324
It was wonderful.

47:11.344 --> 47:14.588
Well, at my boarding school there was not an immense number.

47:14.648 --> 47:16.150
So I was there from eight to eighteen.

47:16.630 --> 47:20.354
There were protections against the harsher side of school life.

47:20.515 --> 47:22.797
One of them was I had a brother who was four years older.

47:23.097 --> 47:28.907
And it wouldn't be true that he stopped me being bullied, but he stopped me being bullied to nightmare, proportionally.

47:29.007 --> 47:31.271
I had a brother who protected me in the same manner.

47:31.392 --> 47:32.333
Forever and dead, too.

47:32.353 --> 47:33.175
Yeah, well, same here.

47:33.235 --> 47:37.122
Though it wasn't a sufficient protection, but it was better.

47:37.923 --> 47:38.604
So there was that.

47:38.704 --> 47:44.835
But mostly, I think, like a lot of people, I protected myself by having somewhere to go other than the sports field or other than the...

47:45.322 --> 47:52.755
changing room and so on, so that I liked studying, and I felt the relief and release that you get from reading.

47:52.995 --> 47:54.097
So that was very nice.

47:54.117 --> 48:00.888
I had two very good English teachers who, by a great bit of luck, profoundly disagreed about quite a lot of things.

48:01.429 --> 48:03.673
Mr. Swan and Mr. Harrison.

48:04.374 --> 48:05.817
Remember their first names?

48:05.917 --> 48:06.758
Ted Swan.

48:07.299 --> 48:07.780
S-W-A-N?

48:08.381 --> 48:10.705
S-W-A-N, just one N.

48:10.955 --> 48:15.967
I think I got to know Ted Swan after I left school, so he became Ted for me.

48:16.007 --> 48:19.515
Mr. Harrison was always just Mr. Harrison, and I don't know his first name.

48:19.876 --> 48:21.199
He's living in Australia now.

48:21.279 --> 48:26.652
I mentioned him in an article in the Sunday Times a few years ago, and somebody wrote to me saying,

48:27.070 --> 48:28.753
Mr. Harrison lives in Australia.

48:28.853 --> 48:29.615
He heard about this.

48:29.635 --> 48:35.125
He's really pleased that you're still, after 60 years, remember him.

48:35.145 --> 48:37.410
So there is a venturing element here then, isn't it?

48:37.430 --> 48:41.037
Yeah, well, the lucky thing here, yeah, I was very lucky with these two teeth.

48:41.057 --> 48:43.882
I was lucky that the school library wasn't bad at all.

48:44.022 --> 48:50.074
I was lucky that my mother gave me a subscription to the Times Literary Supplement when I was really quite young.

48:50.408 --> 48:58.460
It had a kind of snobbish, risky side, because at my school people were mostly reading Superman comics, not reading The Times Literary Supplement.

48:59.021 --> 49:05.891
So that as so often there's a relation between self-respect of a not-good kind that has to do with snobbery.

49:06.212 --> 49:08.375
I was a cut above these Berkshire Ploughboys.

49:08.475 --> 49:10.798
I was reading The Times Literary Supplement.

49:11.459 --> 49:18.610
And there's a bad side to that, but on the other hand we need to find our armour where we can, and that was one place.

49:18.758 --> 49:26.980
or you find it in some sense of superiority, not necessarily well-founded, but it stops you bursting into tears all the time.

49:27.722 --> 49:34.641
Then I was two years in the army, and again, for similar reasons, books were very important to me then.

49:35.347 --> 49:38.852
Well, my schoolmasters disagreed, and that was a terrific bit of luck.

49:38.872 --> 49:40.033
But don't forget the armies.

49:40.374 --> 49:43.097
I'd really like to hear about that.

49:43.377 --> 49:44.339
No, no, you've got a question.

49:44.419 --> 49:58.617
Well, the thing with the teachers was that one of them had been brought up in Cambridge and thought with Levis that Milton, there was something terribly perverse about Milton's writing, that Milton was not a great poet because of the intrinsic perversity of his dealings with English.

49:59.719 --> 50:01.321
He written no language, and so on.

50:01.341 --> 50:03.143
Sort of Johnsonian and Levisite.

50:03.494 --> 50:08.479
The other teacher, Mr. Harrison, was taught much more simply in a different tradition.

50:08.820 --> 50:19.171
And it was very good to me to have teachers where it was clear that you could honorably disagree with somebody else and argue without believing you could prove.

50:20.612 --> 50:22.294
You could argue without quarrelling.

50:22.334 --> 50:25.457
That's a really important thing.

50:25.818 --> 50:29.822
Intellectuals too much suppose that you can argue without quarrelling.

50:30.545 --> 50:34.490
Non-intellectuals too much suppose that you can't argue without quarrelling.

50:34.530 --> 50:38.254
It's a major difference between intellectuals and non-intellectuals.

50:38.715 --> 50:40.457
They're both in danger.

50:40.938 --> 50:45.924
The assumption that you can argue and not end up in a quarrel is often misplaced.

50:45.944 --> 50:49.328
The belief that you can never argue without any other quarrel is equally misplaced.

50:49.348 --> 50:50.950
So I would feel that in my own family.

50:51.490 --> 50:57.818
My father and mother and grandmothers, I didn't know my grandfathers, they were intelligent non-intellectuals.

50:58.507 --> 51:00.589
Dad loved Ike Claudius.

51:00.669 --> 51:04.092
Ike Claudius was absolutely at the limit of the kind of book that Dad would read.

51:04.132 --> 51:07.676
He would never read anything that aspired beyond... And it's a very good book.

51:08.497 --> 51:14.062
He would never read poems that aspired beyond John Maysfield, who wrote some very good poems.

51:14.102 --> 51:21.509
But my older brother, who's an attorney, for him it's Frederick Forsyth, so I... Well, that's right.

51:22.009 --> 51:27.855
And perhaps, you see, maybe 50 years ago that would have... Maybe that would have been... If you go back to my father's generation,

51:27.835 --> 51:30.117
It may be that there weren't quite the Forsythes.

51:30.498 --> 51:34.181
You know, you had James Branch Cabell instead of... I mean, he was there.

51:35.443 --> 51:37.905
You mentioned how important books were to you and the army.

51:37.925 --> 51:53.882
Yeah, well, that again had a... There was a feeling of a need not to... It wasn't quite ivory tower or escape, but it was some relief and release from the ordinary day, so that a book was very important.

51:54.322 --> 51:55.243
I first saw...

51:55.561 --> 51:59.810
Seven Types of Ambiguity when I was in the Army, though I wasn't the person who was reading it.

51:59.911 --> 52:07.888
I was terrifically impressed by the fact that somebody in the training, officer's training program that I was in, had this book called Seven Types of Ambiguity.

52:08.289 --> 52:10.414
It was terribly risky, because the barrack room

52:10.681 --> 52:12.864
people don't want you reading books.

52:12.884 --> 52:16.008
Especially ambiguity.

52:16.028 --> 52:16.388
Exactly.

52:16.789 --> 52:25.240
I'm a fallen naval officer myself, so I understand the... But the army officers, I mean, I was in a, of course, it was two years conscription.

52:26.141 --> 52:30.407
I had the luck that I was in a second battalion.

52:30.767 --> 52:36.655
That is, that the Green Howards had been very successful in recruiting and had a second battalion.

52:36.955 --> 52:43.604
And that was very good in terms of the make-up of the regimental, you know, the regiment that I was in.

52:43.845 --> 52:47.690
We were sent to Egypt before Suez.

52:47.911 --> 52:51.716
So I was in Egypt in 52, I'm trying to think.

52:52.337 --> 52:54.079
Yeah, 52 to 3, something like that.

52:55.121 --> 52:56.983
But so reading was very important.

52:57.003 --> 53:01.069
I mean, you're sitting in some parched tent in Egypt.

53:01.089 --> 53:02.892
I used to spend months on end at sea.

53:02.932 --> 53:04.013
Yeah, it'd be a similar thing.

53:04.294 --> 53:04.634
That's right.

53:04.654 --> 53:05.135
Where would one?

53:05.756 --> 53:06.557
So...

53:07.128 --> 53:11.915
Then I had been very well advised to go in the army before going up to Oxford.

53:12.596 --> 53:16.221
I applied to Oxford from my grammar school.

53:16.722 --> 53:17.944
I was at this grammar school in Bali.

53:17.964 --> 53:19.486
So did you have a commission prior to Oxford?

53:19.506 --> 53:22.010
That's pretty good.

53:22.090 --> 53:22.551
Yeah.

53:22.571 --> 53:29.441
I was told not to do what some people did, which was to defer national service until after getting a degree.

53:29.461 --> 53:31.424
I was told, and it was very good advice, go in the army.

53:31.444 --> 53:32.005
Two bits of it.

53:32.025 --> 53:34.789
One was go in the army now.

53:35.545 --> 53:44.134
Secondly, go in the Army now, as against the Air Force, and go into an infantry regiment, not into the Education Corps or the Service Corps, any of those things.

53:44.495 --> 53:50.782
If you're going to have to do two years, learn to be a soldier rather than learn to be an altogether effective teacher when you don't really want to do it.

53:53.124 --> 54:03.055
So I had a commission in the Greenhouse, then went to Oxford, therefore, at, let me think, I went to Oxford at 20 instead of at 18.

54:04.672 --> 54:06.014
Please, I'm aware.

54:06.034 --> 54:07.336
And I've got to see somebody at four.

54:07.356 --> 54:08.798
No, that's why I'm looking at my clock.

54:08.998 --> 54:10.039
That's great.

54:10.099 --> 54:11.261
Thank you.

54:11.341 --> 54:13.905
Somebody's to come here at four, but we have a bit of time.

54:13.945 --> 54:14.966
That was nice of you.

54:14.986 --> 54:16.468
I didn't mean to be rude.

54:16.508 --> 54:18.030
You weren't rude.

54:18.050 --> 54:20.133
No, I'm glad that you didn't mean to be, because you weren't.

54:21.134 --> 54:22.056
No, that was good of you.

54:22.076 --> 54:22.596
Thank you.

54:22.636 --> 54:24.018
No, it's considerate of you.

54:24.359 --> 54:29.305
I sometimes wonder... Anyway, please.

54:29.746 --> 54:31.168
We're...

54:31.537 --> 54:33.140
This is really a ridiculous question.

54:33.200 --> 54:51.250
I've asked so many people over the last 25 years, and I don't know if Shakespeare is one of the great heroes for you, undoubtedly he is, but if you had a chance to sit with Shakespeare, wave Prospero's magic wand, what one question, above all others, would you like to ask him?

54:51.270 --> 54:54.575
How would you begin the conversation with him?

54:54.595 --> 54:55.176
What puzzles?

54:55.336 --> 54:58.101
I mean, I've asked that question.

54:58.486 --> 55:03.295
Harold Bloom and Schornbaum.

55:04.257 --> 55:05.179
Oh, really?

55:05.199 --> 55:09.407
He said, well, I would want to get to the wellsprings of creativity.

55:09.648 --> 55:12.133
He said it would interest me most.

55:12.193 --> 55:13.896
Robert Giroux said, I'd like to know why he

55:14.332 --> 55:16.695
He never saw fit to publish his place.

55:16.715 --> 55:18.517
I mean, of course, it's a publisher.

55:18.537 --> 55:21.341
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

55:21.681 --> 55:23.564
I don't mean to put you on the spot, but... No, it's very interesting.

55:23.864 --> 55:26.888
I wouldn't... I'd want to know about his reading, for instance.

55:26.908 --> 55:28.289
That would be my only question.

55:28.309 --> 55:29.591
Yeah, no, that's very good.

55:31.854 --> 55:43.208
Because I think that suggests the wellspring of creativity in some ways, but... I tend... I mean, my habit of... Well, my habit of mind is to always think...

55:43.812 --> 55:46.215
very much in terms of particular instances.

55:46.275 --> 55:56.827
The critics that I know to be better than I am are the ones who are very good at a kind of middle tissue that I find very difficult.

55:58.269 --> 56:05.357
The reason why I admire Empson as much as I do... I mean, he is my superior in every respect, and I think he was a genius.

56:05.957 --> 56:09.341
But I don't mean I haven't done anything that I'm pleased with.

56:09.361 --> 56:11.384
I have done things I'm pleased with.

56:11.404 --> 56:13.566
But I think he was wonderful in...

56:13.765 --> 56:30.289
local detail, he was wonderful in some large general context or arc, so that his realising that the rhyme of the ancient mariner is in an important respect about the slave trade is a very, very large, very, very large thought.

56:30.438 --> 56:31.739
It's a surprising thought.

56:32.060 --> 56:42.210
As soon as it's uttered, and as soon as you begin to substantiate it, it's clearly right that these are the years in which Coleridge is reading all about the slave trade, taking out all these books about the slave trade.

56:42.971 --> 56:44.532
It's the slave trade, and so on.

56:44.552 --> 56:47.956
And what is this guilt that hangs around maritime expansion, and so on.

56:48.316 --> 56:50.559
And so there's a kind of sense that it makes.

56:50.639 --> 56:53.922
And then Empson is also good in a kind of middle tissue.

56:54.002 --> 56:59.668
Now, I've always found middle tissue, which would be a little bit like being, you might be

57:01.420 --> 57:08.928
You might be somebody who's very good at details of character, very good at plot, but not very good at situation.

57:09.269 --> 57:31.393
Situation's a kind of middle tissue in the novel, it seems to me, and every now and then you get a book which has a wonderful situation and is short on plot, or a wonderful plot but doesn't really have this sense of, you know, it's as if you bound from a very local observation about the tone in which a particular character said something to a large thought about injustice

57:31.559 --> 57:34.523
without somehow getting this middle bit and so on.

57:35.324 --> 57:47.219
Now, the bit that I'd try to get... So if I had a chance to talk, if I had a chance to put questions to Shakespeare, I think they'd be questions about... They'd go something like this.

57:47.279 --> 57:54.428
Am I wrong to think that something goes wrong with this work of yours?

57:56.130 --> 57:57.752
Because the thing that I...

58:00.483 --> 58:21.635
The thing that I find myself most caring about is, as it were, how can it be that Eliot, whom I admire so much, let me see, I'm not going to agree with what I'm not going to say, but how can it be that Eliot, who is so deeply and profoundly sensitive to so much, writes in Gerontian an anti-Semitic poem, because anti-Semitism is insensitive.

58:21.956 --> 58:22.597
It's terrific.

58:23.038 --> 58:23.959
Now, I...

58:24.226 --> 58:40.224
don't believe that Garantian is an anti-Semitic poem, but my friend John Gross is quite sure that it is, and quite sure that it's Eliot who says the juice quads on the windowsill again, whereas I think that it's Garantian who says that, and I've never met anybody who agrees with Garantian or who would like to be like Garantian.

58:41.386 --> 58:49.575
But the starting point for me often has to do with some failure, either in a receiver or in a transmitter.

58:49.792 --> 58:59.404
It's clearly that Eliot Gorontian is not getting through to John Gross, and is it Eliot's failure to transmit or John Gross's failure to receive?

59:00.765 --> 59:03.749
So that for me, there's something terribly wrong with Measure for Measure.

59:03.769 --> 59:05.311
We take it back to the Shakespeare case.

59:05.992 --> 59:08.515
I think there's something profoundly wrong with Measure for Measure.

59:08.915 --> 59:15.203
I would like to have it explained to me that I've got that wrong, because I think it's a very great play.

59:15.884 --> 59:18.127
I mean, I say it perhaps too often.

59:18.187 --> 59:19.208
I'm not a Christian.

59:19.492 --> 59:26.022
It is very, it's not disturbing to me, it's immensely surprising to me to have a 45-year-old son who's a Christian.

59:26.102 --> 59:28.065
It's really an amazement to me.

59:29.167 --> 59:39.102
Fortunately, I... Well, I think that literature, I mean, the interesting thing is that literature gives you sympathetic access to citizens of belief that are not your own.

59:39.523 --> 59:45.752
And the terrible thing that's happened lately is that literature is valued in proportion as it concurs with what you believe.

59:46.289 --> 59:51.816
entertaining beliefs that you do not hold is an imperative individual and social training.

It's very difficult to train people to entertain beliefs.

59:55.540 --> 59:59.806
It's much easier to get them to believe things than to get them to entertain beliefs.

01:00:00.206 --> 01:00:02.489
Anyway, so part of this would be for measure for measure.

01:00:02.529 --> 01:00:15.385
I'd like to know why is it all right for Angelo to have been and to be known to the Duke to have been a duplicitous, treacherous person?

01:00:16.090 --> 01:00:39.555
What does it mean to say, hence we shall see if power change purpose, what our schemers be, if all along the very person who says that knows that Angelo defected on his engagement, his affianced Marianna, by pretending in her discoveries of dishonour because she no longer has a dowry.

01:00:40.376 --> 01:00:42.157
Now, I don't believe that about Angelo.

01:00:42.458 --> 01:00:44.680
I think the opening of the play is true,

01:00:45.706 --> 01:00:51.401
And Aeschylus is right to say, if any in Vienna be of worth to undergo such ample praise and honor, it is Lord Angelo.

01:00:52.002 --> 01:01:00.103
And the terrible thing that happens is that somebody who is, from one point of view, morally and spiritually all right, but only from one point of view, has this hidden...
