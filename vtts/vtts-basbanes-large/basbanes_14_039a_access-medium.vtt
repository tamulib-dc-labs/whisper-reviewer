WEBVTT

00:03.693 --> 00:09.980
You have two moments in the bibliophilae.

00:10.000 --> 00:30.062
Yes, of course you have the beginning of the decouvert, but after you bought the books to read and to have the best lecture of one text.

00:30.142 --> 00:32.485
Grosje, he don't bought the

00:32.853 --> 00:35.617
the most rarest edition.

00:36.158 --> 00:52.283
He bought the best philological text of one book.

00:56.670 --> 01:00.396
But he bought not the first edition,

01:02.519 --> 01:06.104
of Dante or he bought not the first edition of Petrarch.

01:08.027 --> 01:17.781
He bought the best edition of the theological point of view.

01:18.582 --> 01:21.446
Now you're talking about Goyer now, Jean Goyer.

01:21.467 --> 01:21.827
Yes.

01:22.820 --> 01:29.268
But of course he put beautiful bindings on them.

01:29.348 --> 01:32.472
That's why we remember Grolier is for the bindings.

01:32.572 --> 01:33.173
Isn't that right?

01:33.193 --> 01:35.216
No, no, no.

01:36.157 --> 01:41.063
Before exists the book and after exists the binding.

01:42.044 --> 01:47.471
Grolier before bought a book and after he put on the book a binding.

01:48.272 --> 01:52.658
When we speak about Grolier we must

01:53.195 --> 01:55.599
speak of the man, but he choose a book.

01:56.680 --> 02:00.987
He like a book and he put on the book a precious binding.

02:01.628 --> 02:02.689
This is the process.

02:03.030 --> 02:08.998
The process is not right on the binding.

02:09.379 --> 02:10.821
This is nothing.

02:11.823 --> 02:14.066
Why did he make such beautiful bindings then?

02:14.587 --> 02:21.497
Because he loved the text, because he was a man of culture.

02:24.312 --> 02:40.395
Because the great collector bought books and not shoe and not painting.

02:40.675 --> 02:43.820
But the books have a text.

02:44.260 --> 02:46.443
First of all, it's a text.

02:47.685 --> 02:52.632
The concept of first editions wasn't an issue in those days.

02:53.270 --> 02:59.377
That only lately has become an important consideration, as you just said.

02:59.397 --> 03:02.541
Of the period of ecritism.

03:03.422 --> 03:06.926
Yes.

03:08.588 --> 03:22.264
If you want to have some idea of the bibliography, you must read the first, the Brunet, four

03:22.919 --> 03:27.503
edition and the Brunet fifth edition.

03:29.044 --> 03:52.825
In this period, change absolutely the complex, the complex, the fashion to look to the book because... I'm sorry.

03:53.665 --> 04:09.809
If you look the old bibliography, also if you look Brunei, what he put?

04:10.189 --> 04:11.311
The best edition.

04:12.973 --> 04:23.048
And after he said, the

04:23.720 --> 04:36.618
the book was printed the first time in a very bad lesson 100 years before.

04:40.003 --> 04:53.102
Just in the half of 19th century with the exhibition of the great international exhibition

04:53.656 --> 05:09.875
in Paris of 1950 that is just in this moment that you have the development of philology.

05:13.038 --> 05:22.549
It's the first time that appear on the Boulton de Bibliophile in France.

05:22.867 --> 05:43.551
two articles, very important, but he changed the spirit of the bibliophily and he said from this moment we must choose the first edition and the original binding.

05:44.572 --> 05:50.359
But this is recent from

05:51.183 --> 06:02.137
860, 880, before was the good text, not the first edition or the precious edition.

06:02.657 --> 06:03.498
So it was the text.

06:03.939 --> 06:04.880
It was the content.

06:05.161 --> 06:06.002
It was the content.

06:06.022 --> 06:07.303
The content always.

06:07.984 --> 06:13.871
Only that in the past was a question of reading.

06:15.453 --> 06:20.700
The best text of a philogenical point of view.

06:21.963 --> 06:50.670
And after one epilology, matrisoformas, enata, come forma moderna, is born as a modern, as a modern, all in this moment, you, he, he, he,

06:51.781 --> 07:07.319
He started the philological study on the text, the criticism on the text, and so it was not necessary to have the good edition.

07:08.320 --> 07:16.590
But the interest was on a historical interest.

07:16.958 --> 07:35.905
on the first edition, because the first edition is the edition that from his start, the thoughts, the idea and so on.

07:35.925 --> 07:44.417
But the first, but nobody liked old binding.

07:46.608 --> 07:56.659
The first exhibition exists in Paris in 1990, an album of old binding, 900.

07:56.679 --> 08:14.978
It's the first time, but it's very rare that you find in old catalog notes on grid binding.

08:15.700 --> 08:21.067
Yes, you know concrete binding, but very few of very, very important binding.

08:21.468 --> 08:26.995
But not a little original binding, they don't exist.

08:27.016 --> 08:34.646
And this, the first exhibition was in Edinburgh in 99.

08:34.866 --> 08:38.411
The first in Italy, it was in Pitti in 26.

08:38.752 --> 08:44.880
The first catalogue was in Paris.

08:46.244 --> 08:54.717
and Morgan also that he made importance to the old banding, contemporary banding, but nobody before.

08:56.840 --> 09:08.798
And this also because it is from this moment that the first edition was the edition that you prefer.

09:10.360 --> 09:13.365
You chose the book, the great collector

09:13.936 --> 09:26.708
You said as we were walking into the dining room that you learned bookselling in Paris.

09:27.368 --> 09:27.849
Is that right?

09:28.489 --> 09:33.194
Yes.

09:34.475 --> 09:36.096
Could you tell me a little bit about that?

09:36.717 --> 09:43.403
Could you tell me a little bit about your background, how you decided to become a bookseller?

09:43.619 --> 10:00.197
Because I like books and so I live on the... I think that the good city was Paris.

10:01.859 --> 10:08.186
And I lived for years on the trottoir and the bookshop.

10:10.288 --> 10:11.770
But you said you're from Milano.

10:12.003 --> 10:13.285
This is your home.

10:13.445 --> 10:15.007
I mean, you were born here?

10:15.287 --> 10:16.088
Yes, yes.

10:16.108 --> 10:19.213
I was born in Milano, yes.

10:19.233 --> 10:22.877
Is there a tradition of books in Milano?

10:22.998 --> 10:25.381
Is there a long... Yes, in 19th century.

10:26.863 --> 10:33.051
But my tradition of books, you must speak clear.

10:35.354 --> 10:41.402
If you told me it's a tradition of books or it's a tradition of bibliophily,

10:41.669 --> 10:43.912
Because there are two different things.

10:43.932 --> 10:45.734
Of course it's a tradition of books.

10:46.195 --> 10:50.540
You have a great patrimoine of books in Italy.

10:50.620 --> 10:54.305
Of course.

10:55.426 --> 11:11.406
It was the same as in France, as in perhaps most in 1970, during the Renaissance, during the Baroque, during the Rococo.

11:11.977 --> 11:19.266
19th century not so much, 20th century nothing.

11:19.286 --> 11:25.454
But the history of the Bibliophily... That's the question I think I meant.

11:25.474 --> 11:40.212
The Bibliophily, we have a very good Bibliophily in 19th century, around the Trivulti, Omel, Zidane, all these people.

11:41.170 --> 11:42.752
Milanese people.

11:42.772 --> 11:44.333
Mostly Milanese.

11:45.635 --> 11:51.381
And after you have a tradition also during this century in Florence.

11:54.204 --> 12:01.292
De Marini, Gennari Conti, Feltrinelli.

12:03.434 --> 12:05.696
So what kinds of things did you learn?

12:05.756 --> 12:09.220
How does a person become

12:09.790 --> 12:16.858
a scholarly bookseller.

12:18.440 --> 12:30.455
The reason.

12:32.297 --> 12:33.618
You want to know the reason?

12:33.758 --> 12:38.464
Well, the reason or how you explain

12:39.102 --> 12:44.008
the way you acquired your knowledge and your facility with books, your understanding.

12:44.749 --> 12:49.796
No, listen.

12:49.816 --> 12:51.819
Listen.

12:52.820 --> 13:00.871
First, you, as a man, you have your emotions.

13:01.772 --> 13:03.114
Emotions.

13:04.135 --> 13:08.080
You have your emotions.

13:08.937 --> 13:11.159
Very nice.

13:11.319 --> 13:13.902
And your emotion you have first here.

13:17.946 --> 13:18.927
Very often here.

13:19.848 --> 13:21.430
You think first here, before here?

13:22.251 --> 13:23.692
Yes, sometimes yes.

13:24.533 --> 13:25.073
First here.

13:25.113 --> 13:27.096
After here.

13:28.657 --> 13:29.258
After here.

13:29.778 --> 13:30.519
And after him.

13:31.160 --> 13:37.206
After the I. And very important is the nose.

13:37.246 --> 13:38.387
That's wonderful.

13:38.823 --> 13:45.272
This is... What you're saying is that you... And after, if you love something, you want to know.

13:46.534 --> 14:02.415
And you have your... Your brain, your... You love glass.

14:03.217 --> 14:06.401
My father was a glass maker.

14:08.464 --> 14:08.644
And so...

14:09.316 --> 14:38.462
we have many of the objects of my father are in the museum, in the Corning Museum, in the Duomo di Milano, but what was it like glass and so he made a lot of objects because he loved and when you love something

14:39.218 --> 14:51.591
You try to know about, you think about, you look.

14:51.611 --> 14:56.776
This is the only... It's difficult to... No, that's wonderful, it's unique.

14:56.796 --> 14:58.518
Have you ever heard an explanation like that?

14:59.980 --> 15:02.482
It's not easy, I mean.

15:02.703 --> 15:04.905
Sometimes it's difficult to...

15:05.797 --> 15:08.900
to give a quick word and explanation of it.

15:08.920 --> 15:14.805
It's difficult to explain you this not in my language or in French, you see.

15:26.815 --> 15:34.302
But you cannot write on bibliothèes, bibliothèes,

15:35.935 --> 15:54.934
If you don't look before the history of the bibliography, after you can understand a lot of questions.

15:54.954 --> 16:05.385
But the love of the book was different in, but it was extremely

16:05.585 --> 16:10.252
all changed in the half of the 19th century.

16:10.272 --> 16:12.855
But it changed absolutely.

16:17.341 --> 16:20.446
Now you say your father was a glassmaker here in Milan?

16:20.606 --> 16:20.886
Yes.

16:23.610 --> 16:25.333
And did he have a love?

16:25.413 --> 16:26.875
Was he a bibliophile?

16:27.095 --> 16:29.058
Did he impart a love of books?

16:29.278 --> 16:34.225
A little, because he was a Muhammad Kultura.

16:34.542 --> 16:36.064
Yes, a culture man.

16:36.084 --> 17:03.975
Man, so he loved books, and he bought time to time some books, and this was a reason that also, but I was possibly for me to make the glass maker, or the book was just a little, because he was a culture man, and... At what point did you realize that you wanted

17:04.647 --> 17:05.808
to make books your life.

17:13.298 --> 17:33.203
Because it's not different.

17:37.165 --> 17:41.610
You want to do something that you love.

17:43.393 --> 18:07.122
If one man finds a world that he loves, this means that he corresponds to his character, his sensibility, his temperament.

18:08.890 --> 18:25.251
And so, he has the possibility, he tries to transform what he loves also in an activity.

18:33.461 --> 18:35.083
If you love flowers,

18:37.797 --> 18:41.200
and you study flowers, botanicals.

18:41.761 --> 18:59.539
And you like to live in the garden, you like to live, to make travel, to look strange flowers and so.

18:59.919 --> 19:03.843
What is the most aspiration?

19:03.923 --> 19:07.787
To make your business, your life,

19:08.712 --> 19:09.553
on your passion.

19:09.573 --> 19:10.955
Dedicated to your passion.

19:12.937 --> 19:20.225
And so it was for me, from books.

19:20.866 --> 19:29.356
I think I can say that you were very lucky to dedicate yourself to a passion, as a worker.

19:29.496 --> 19:35.022
Sometimes it's not so easy, in fact, to dedicate not himself to the... One must work.

19:35.122 --> 19:36.804
The man must work himself.

19:36.824 --> 19:38.466
My son is a lawyer.

19:40.066 --> 19:50.537
but he has this inclination when he has five years old, ten years old.

19:51.418 --> 19:55.542
I was sure, we were sure that he was a lawyer.

19:56.483 --> 19:57.904
Our son, you are thinking?

19:57.964 --> 19:58.385
Yes.

19:59.146 --> 20:01.048
I have four, my third one.

20:01.748 --> 20:08.335
I have one, but it's also one, it was a little,

20:08.787 --> 20:17.056
He liked economy and so is in a great American bank.

20:19.299 --> 20:29.190
He worked in New York for American people and he liked immensely what he do.

20:29.210 --> 20:38.440
Another he liked always from painting and so and he would be a dealer

20:38.690 --> 20:45.337
in painting, but this is the experience.

20:45.377 --> 20:50.322
Did you always... I think that everybody has to do what he wants, not obliged.

20:50.903 --> 20:54.207
Is this something you always thought you wanted to do, to work with books?

20:54.227 --> 20:56.870
Is this something that you always thought that you wanted to do?

20:57.270 --> 21:03.837
No, before, but I...

21:04.475 --> 21:11.364
Before to burn, no, but in one moment of my life I have seen books.

21:11.604 --> 21:20.016
My father has a nice library, I look books, I like books, and they say, why not?

21:21.017 --> 21:28.727
No.

21:30.749 --> 21:42.881
These artichokes are the first of the season.

21:42.901 --> 21:45.183
I follow the season.

21:45.763 --> 21:51.409
I don't like to eat artichokes, but there are no season of artichokes.

21:51.869 --> 21:59.136
Because now you have the habit to find everything, everywhere, in any time of day.

21:59.403 --> 22:01.607
But it's not always the best.

22:01.707 --> 22:06.034
No, but it's not, I mean.

22:06.054 --> 22:07.115
Where do they grow them?

22:07.135 --> 22:08.157
Are they from around?

22:08.518 --> 22:10.200
I think they are Italian, yes.

22:11.262 --> 22:14.067
Generally, I grow over in the south.

22:14.087 --> 22:14.828
I thought that's so.

22:15.168 --> 22:16.471
Yes.

22:16.491 --> 22:20.217
In Vianitos, or in Sicily, or Roma.

22:23.021 --> 22:23.622
Do you want to know?

22:26.572 --> 22:38.083
You see, all is, sometimes in the, in the dipole, at the beginning it's difficult, because nobody arrives to find what he wants.

22:39.805 --> 22:47.192
And this is, this is, it's a shame.

22:48.593 --> 22:55.600
The best is one, one man can realize himself in what he likes.

22:57.048 --> 23:01.632
How did you decide what kinds of books you wanted to specialize in?

23:02.473 --> 23:05.797
Italian culture, of course.

23:05.817 --> 23:06.798
In all its glory.

23:07.919 --> 23:10.461
In all of its glory, all of Italian culture.

23:10.781 --> 23:26.717
Of all sense, yes, but only books like documents, not bibliographies, philology, criticism, not books of study.

23:28.621 --> 23:46.885
of our first edition, illustrated edition, typographical edition.

23:48.888 --> 23:53.214
So, from the very beginning, you wanted to celebrate Italian culture.

23:53.995 --> 23:57.099
Not from the first convenience, not the first.

23:57.139 --> 23:58.020
You see,

23:58.169 --> 24:05.699
One day came after one other day.

24:05.899 --> 24:09.244
Every day is something new.

24:09.264 --> 24:20.599
So little to little to have your taste, what you wish, what you can believe, what you understand.

24:20.659 --> 24:27.788
And this is the formation, formazione, come si dice,

24:28.055 --> 24:34.601
And so little to little you made your personality and your choice.

24:37.004 --> 24:40.487
But I don't say the first day I want to do this.

24:40.507 --> 24:42.269
Thank you.

24:42.289 --> 24:43.830
First is the curiosity.

24:44.791 --> 24:45.652
It's the curiosity.

24:46.133 --> 24:47.474
First is to know.

24:47.494 --> 24:48.455
First is to look.

24:49.155 --> 24:50.317
First is this.

24:51.278 --> 24:51.798
It's this.

24:53.179 --> 24:53.860
First is

24:54.852 --> 25:01.565
Sometimes you understand nothing and you have here something very stuck.

25:01.926 --> 25:04.731
And so why?

25:05.372 --> 25:16.033
And so little to little you try to

25:21.903 --> 25:34.341
I am a self-made man, but all people are the self-made men.

25:36.844 --> 25:48.501
You have chance to meet important people and to learn from important people.

25:49.949 --> 26:01.802
I learned from a lot of people, but to every you can learn something.

26:06.087 --> 26:13.995
The problem for a bookseller is not to buy what he can sell.

26:15.597 --> 26:16.698
This is horrible.

26:17.259 --> 26:19.922
This is horrible.

26:21.151 --> 26:26.043
Sometimes he must for a reason of necessity.

26:26.063 --> 26:34.523
But the good bookseller is the bookseller that he made the choice and on the choice he made business.

26:35.626 --> 26:39.295
But the business came after the choice.

26:41.840 --> 26:46.667
So you make the decision on a book, on the merits of the book.

26:46.848 --> 26:50.974
Yes, because I lie, because it corresponds to my mentality.

26:51.395 --> 26:53.458
And after I try... No, no.

26:53.478 --> 26:54.960
Yes, you know.

26:55.200 --> 26:59.447
I don't know what it says in English.

27:01.530 --> 27:02.552
Anyhow, try.

27:02.612 --> 27:03.693
Go in... Yes.

27:04.014 --> 27:06.658
Go deep.

27:07.379 --> 27:08.401
Go deep.

27:08.501 --> 27:09.282
Chateaunier.

27:09.430 --> 27:14.275
Is it Chessnais?

27:14.375 --> 27:15.015
Yes.

27:15.256 --> 27:17.918
Chessnais, yes.

27:17.938 --> 27:20.140
Oh, my goodness.

27:20.160 --> 27:21.181
Thank you so much, really.

27:21.501 --> 27:24.744
This is such a welcome and a treat, really.

27:24.805 --> 27:25.165
Thank you.

27:28.228 --> 27:28.728
Oh, my goodness.

27:28.748 --> 27:31.030
I couldn't stay here.

27:33.933 --> 27:38.037
I'm sorry, we were on to something there that was very...

27:38.658 --> 27:41.321
Very interesting.

27:41.602 --> 27:44.405
No, yes, you must buy what you like.

27:45.707 --> 27:58.482
And after you will try, you study the book and you will try to find a man that can't correspond to this book and to sell him this book.

28:02.047 --> 28:08.074
But you don't buy from

28:09.505 --> 28:11.468
to sell.

28:11.488 --> 28:12.309
Yes, of course.

28:15.413 --> 28:28.651
But if I found, I don't know, some German books very important but are not in my spirit, I don't buy.

28:28.691 --> 28:37.082
If I found American books I don't know about,

28:40.184 --> 29:10.174
Yes, if I know the first proclamation and thought ten pounds, I know that this, he cost a little more and so I'm happy to buy, but... I think I'm all set, thank you.

29:11.403 --> 29:17.230
Is it difficult to keep finding books of a quality to which you're accustomed?

29:17.890 --> 29:22.736
Probably all the time, all our life.

29:29.123 --> 29:40.296
If you see the quality of the books of Krauss, of Brazdao,

29:40.664 --> 29:41.786
of great quality.

29:44.110 --> 29:50.099
But also for these great booksellers, it was not easy to always.

29:54.126 --> 29:57.932
Would you say that most of your clients are here in Italy?

29:58.453 --> 30:00.155
No, they were.

30:00.175 --> 30:01.958
Really?

30:01.978 --> 30:06.165
In the States, in France, in Italy.

30:09.217 --> 30:11.219
Do you do much business with institutions?

30:12.120 --> 30:12.421
Yes.

30:16.385 --> 30:18.107
Are they looking for rarity?

30:18.127 --> 30:34.427
Or to go back to what you were saying earlier, or for significance or content, are they looking for a rare item?

30:35.688 --> 30:39.072
I mean institutions in particular, actually.

30:40.368 --> 30:48.238
They were rare, not exist.

30:51.101 --> 30:54.826
It does not exist.

30:54.846 --> 31:00.372
There are very few cases that exist.

31:00.452 --> 31:07.641
In this sense,

31:09.038 --> 31:11.582
But you don't buy a book because it's rare.

31:13.444 --> 31:20.775
You buy a book and you sell the book because it's important.

31:20.795 --> 31:27.124
If the book is also rare, it costs more or less.

31:29.327 --> 31:33.393
But I never bought something because it's rare.

31:34.314 --> 31:37.459
Because to the refogies, to these assets,

31:37.945 --> 31:49.397
All the leaves and all the stones are rare.

31:51.179 --> 31:56.966
All the stones are rare.

31:57.306 --> 31:59.288
The stones are rare.

31:59.368 --> 32:00.509
The stones are rare.

32:00.569 --> 32:01.370
I didn't get the word.

32:01.390 --> 32:06.636
I love that, stones.

32:06.785 --> 32:14.633
Very rare case that rarity is a question that you buy for rarity question.

32:14.653 --> 32:35.593
For instance, if you must collect an important collection, you must rebuild the life of Einstein or of Petra.

32:36.620 --> 32:59.530
through his books and in this and so you try to have all what Petrarca has in print, all what Einstein has in print and so this is possible you have a little insignificant book of Einstein, of Petrarca that is extremely rare.

33:00.912 --> 33:05.918
Although in this reason it's important to choose the rare also the books is

33:06.235 --> 33:20.190
absolutely no importance because he goes to the reconstruction of the life of a man.

33:20.210 --> 33:23.153
Do you understand what he means?

33:23.173 --> 33:23.833
Yes, yes, yes.

33:26.836 --> 33:36.006
But if

33:37.471 --> 33:46.058
If I bought Civilization, for instance, I tried to have the first Copernicus.

33:51.543 --> 34:06.516
But if I made a collection about Copernicus, also the first edition,

34:07.441 --> 34:27.371
But I try to have also the little books insignificant of scientific importance against Copernico, what he was made just the year after the Revoluciones of Breterrano.

34:28.132 --> 34:34.461
So in this case, the rarity of insignificant books

34:35.048 --> 34:38.332
It's important because it's explained.

34:40.134 --> 34:45.101
But when you see a book sale that you say rare books.

34:46.643 --> 34:48.004
What do you mean rare books?

34:49.066 --> 34:57.637
Rare books is the polyphilo.

34:58.017 --> 34:59.499
You know the polyphilo?

34:59.519 --> 35:00.701
Polyphilo.

35:00.721 --> 35:01.061
Colonna.

35:01.421 --> 35:01.942
Colonna.

35:02.162 --> 35:03.104
Oh yes, okay.

35:03.124 --> 35:04.245
It's not a rare book.

35:06.352 --> 35:07.894
It's not a rare book.

35:09.336 --> 35:21.971
I don't know the... The first book of Fleming is not a rare book.

35:23.834 --> 35:25.756
Of Einstein is not a rare book.

35:27.899 --> 35:35.228
But it's much more important as a lot of

35:36.018 --> 35:41.303
are the great books of our civilization.

35:41.483 --> 35:56.338
Of course, if Einstein, the first... You don't claim the name of Einstein's book.

35:56.358 --> 36:00.963
The first Einstein is very, very rare.

36:02.965 --> 36:05.367
He costs a great, great price.

36:05.633 --> 36:10.958
But your choice, your choice is not because it's rare.

36:11.539 --> 36:13.380
Your choice because it's Einstein.

36:13.400 --> 36:14.241
That's right.

36:14.281 --> 36:16.263
The first book is not all that important.

36:16.543 --> 36:22.689
Always, and always you must... Remember, the stone and the tree are rare.

36:23.670 --> 36:32.178
And when you see a book sale that is rare books, what do you mean rare books?

36:32.198 --> 36:34.560
Are little books that are not...

36:34.945 --> 36:38.630
rare at all that are very important of the civilization.

36:39.411 --> 36:46.120
Of course they are rare if many people want what only a few of them can have.

36:46.280 --> 36:47.382
That makes it rare.

36:48.463 --> 37:02.522
Yes, but you, of course, when you write you can say first edition very rare.

37:03.228 --> 37:10.319
But I say that this is very rare.

37:10.339 --> 37:13.564
He depends from the price, not for the choice.

37:16.308 --> 37:17.610
You bought a book.

37:20.294 --> 37:29.809
If you want, I can give you an incunabula, religioso or religious.

37:30.127 --> 37:36.396
Religions of the predicate, the priest.

37:41.864 --> 37:43.947
One copy only in the world.

37:48.334 --> 37:48.874
If you want.

37:49.375 --> 37:54.763
It's not rare, it's extremely rare because it's known.

37:55.464 --> 37:58.689
Apparently known, only one copy.

37:58.709 --> 37:59.610
One known copy.

37:59.978 --> 38:01.680
One known cover.

38:02.521 --> 38:07.065
But what pleasure can give you a so kind of book?

38:08.166 --> 38:19.437
If this book is an important book, I Ragionamenti dell'Arettino.

38:20.258 --> 38:22.440
Do you know what is Ragionamenti dell'Arettino?

38:22.901 --> 38:24.622
Arettino, Pietro Arettino.

38:24.642 --> 38:25.083
Of course.

38:25.904 --> 38:29.327
He wrote a book very erotic.

38:30.050 --> 38:42.684
but very interesting because it depends on all the culture of the Renaissance.

38:44.526 --> 38:46.488
It's a book very important for the Renaissance.

38:49.311 --> 38:53.276
Are known two copies, three copies, extremely rare.

38:54.457 --> 38:57.861
Or so, perhaps four copies.

38:57.881 --> 38:58.842
So if you have

39:01.032 --> 39:16.557
from a side, this Incunabula Unique of this priest of Venice and the Ragionamenti dell'Arettino.

39:18.380 --> 39:19.562
What you choose?

39:21.826 --> 39:24.610
Gli Ragionamenti dell'Arettino, not the

39:25.163 --> 39:36.315
because the Regenamento de la Retina, you have an important document of a civilization, of the other, unique.

39:37.136 --> 39:42.202
Yet you can say I have a unique book, but all is unique.

39:42.803 --> 39:46.066
Oh, I have a great collection of drawing.

39:46.086 --> 39:46.987
All are unique.

39:49.830 --> 39:53.955
And the books, unique, most...

39:55.100 --> 40:12.613
We don't want to take up too much of your time, by the way, either, because I know that... Thank you so much.

40:12.633 --> 40:14.256
This was quite wonderful.

40:14.607 --> 40:18.210
Your first lunch, Helga Delisicte?

40:18.230 --> 40:18.311
Yes.

40:18.331 --> 40:19.912
Well, I'm glad to have my first.

40:19.932 --> 40:21.193
In all of Italy.

40:21.213 --> 40:23.536
I'm very glad to be the first.

40:23.556 --> 40:24.376
You are.

40:24.977 --> 40:29.802
You'll be the most memorable by far, too.

40:29.822 --> 40:35.307
Not the unique, I hope.

40:35.967 --> 40:40.772
Very interesting, how this goes.

40:40.792 --> 40:41.813
Yeah, that's great.

40:44.003 --> 40:54.836
It's beautiful, Bonnie, isn't it?

40:55.276 --> 40:55.537
Which one?

40:55.557 --> 40:56.097
Which three is it?

40:56.117 --> 41:10.674
I have to say that you have to say that you want to say that you want to say that?

41:10.694 --> 41:12.036
You want to say that?

41:12.691 --> 41:21.564
I'm not able to make some American.

41:21.664 --> 41:23.046
It's concentrated.

41:23.687 --> 41:24.949
Do you want sugar in it?

41:25.069 --> 41:26.611
Do they usually?

41:26.631 --> 41:28.013
It depends on the taste.

41:28.875 --> 41:32.059
I don't take any sugar but it's just a meter.

41:32.220 --> 41:34.603
Now I bring you the next.

41:34.623 --> 41:39.390
Can we have all kinds of coffee bars now but nothing is authentic.

41:41.041 --> 41:46.949
So have you made a study of bibliophilia, Mr. Chiesa?

41:47.189 --> 41:48.090
No, I haven't.

41:48.110 --> 41:50.714
Because you seem so knowledgeable on the history of it.

41:51.635 --> 41:53.537
No.

41:53.557 --> 41:56.000
I buy every day a lot of books.

41:56.020 --> 41:58.143
Every day you buy?

41:58.704 --> 41:59.365
Not now.

42:01.327 --> 42:03.350
Do people come to the shop?

42:03.370 --> 42:07.015
I just like it black.

42:07.696 --> 42:08.096
Black?

42:08.136 --> 42:09.137
Without children?

42:09.157 --> 42:09.738
Just like that.

42:09.878 --> 42:10.339
Thank you.

42:13.222 --> 42:26.537
Some come in the shop, some I write, some I... I don't have computer.

42:26.617 --> 42:31.102
The computer is not in a ride.

42:33.164 --> 42:34.926
Do you write your own catalogs?

42:36.107 --> 42:41.473
I do two catalogs in my life.

42:41.926 --> 42:42.787
That's it?

42:43.408 --> 42:47.312
I did.

42:47.572 --> 42:55.560
I made one in 53 and the second in 54.

42:56.081 --> 43:02.607
And after it was not necessary, I made special offer to special people.

43:05.030 --> 43:06.311
Well, my goodness.

43:06.451 --> 43:10.195
So when you acquire a book, how do people know that you have it?

43:10.647 --> 43:24.526
Do you call them and say... Listen, I tell you something that I must appreciate you.

43:27.710 --> 43:39.827
The good bookseller, it's not that I mean that I am good in the bookseller, but the good bookseller are booksellers that before

43:40.229 --> 43:47.036
he made choice and after he tried to make business on the choice.

43:50.180 --> 44:02.513
So, this you have two kinds of booksellers.

44:02.894 --> 44:09.561
You have booksellers that are

44:10.925 --> 44:14.049
No, no.

44:16.211 --> 44:24.120
When did all the ships arrive in a, how do you call it, heaven?

44:24.180 --> 44:25.041
Haven.

44:25.642 --> 44:26.964
Haven, yes.

44:28.005 --> 44:32.971
So you have booksellers that are heaven, who arrive.

44:33.772 --> 44:34.933
Where arrive?

44:34.953 --> 44:38.417
Arrive and party.

44:39.443 --> 44:54.598
and leave culture, and is very important, bookseller, and are bookseller that he made only choice, and only choice made business.

44:54.618 --> 45:08.792
So if you want to try a book, to try to find a book on science, for instance,

45:09.616 --> 45:15.043
what you write to Hill or to Norton in the States.

45:15.063 --> 45:21.190
Or Norman in the States.

45:22.491 --> 45:36.248
If you are interested in a Spanish book, you wrote to Gilles in London and in Spain.

45:37.021 --> 45:42.649
If you want French literature, the best are these people.

45:43.270 --> 45:51.783
So it's not that the people come, the good people come to the bookseller.

45:51.803 --> 46:03.400
If you put a renommé, a reputation of special books that you collect,

46:05.624 --> 46:09.109
They know that you have those books.

46:09.129 --> 46:11.873
They know that he has the best, too.

46:12.013 --> 46:12.734
You understand.

46:13.175 --> 46:19.244
But this means also for a great, great bookseller.

46:19.945 --> 46:32.323
I know two booksellers fantastic in London that made business only of a book of Chirkos.

46:32.343 --> 46:34.686
Chirkos.

46:34.919 --> 46:39.626
Do you know what is a circle?

46:39.646 --> 46:43.131
The spectacle of animals and so on.

46:43.872 --> 46:46.496
Circles.

46:47.698 --> 46:55.530
So if you want something on the circle, you must try to be stupid.

46:55.610 --> 46:57.613
Very special.

46:58.915 --> 47:01.939
I know I've observed that he made only mathematics.

47:03.252 --> 47:06.576
And so all mathematics is very knowledge.

47:08.859 --> 47:12.123
Or also children's books.

47:12.423 --> 47:14.206
Yes, or children's books.

47:15.127 --> 47:22.136
But this came more in the past.

47:22.156 --> 47:29.665
Now it's a little less because the books are more rare and the booksellers try to have a little old books.

47:31.400 --> 47:37.225
But I don't buy French book or German book or Spanish book.

47:41.149 --> 47:43.071
I'm very specialized.

47:43.091 --> 47:46.874
Do you ever run across books that are a total surprise to you?

47:47.254 --> 47:51.859
Books that you don't know, but when you see them you say, I have to have them.

47:52.399 --> 47:53.320
They're very important.

47:53.660 --> 47:54.281
Every day.

47:55.462 --> 47:57.364
Every day.

47:57.384 --> 48:00.006
But you know.

48:00.475 --> 48:05.901
You leave and more you know nothing.

48:07.002 --> 48:13.048
That's crazy.

48:13.068 --> 48:23.379
So you have every day the new experience and after very often you find in the books some new but not novelty.

48:23.399 --> 48:24.660
You must read the book.

48:26.446 --> 48:34.096
In our shop we read the book, so we find very often fantastic news in the book.

48:34.116 --> 48:34.216
News.

48:34.857 --> 48:35.157
News.

48:35.558 --> 48:35.858
News.

48:35.978 --> 48:36.639
Not known.

48:37.580 --> 48:38.041
News.

48:38.061 --> 48:45.551
There are a lot of old books that are Portatrici.

48:46.512 --> 48:49.275
Great books.

48:49.296 --> 48:49.556
New news.

48:49.796 --> 48:51.238
Yes.

48:55.353 --> 49:12.278
If you read, you find extremely interesting news about some that you don't know before.

49:12.399 --> 49:22.294
That's what you talked about too.

49:22.334 --> 49:23.976
That's exactly right.

49:24.226 --> 49:35.263
He was talking about booksellers today and the knowledge of the booksellers in the past helping people.

49:35.483 --> 49:35.924
That's right.

49:36.805 --> 49:37.927
Sorry?

49:37.947 --> 49:40.231
Well, the knowledge of the booksellers.

49:40.271 --> 49:42.474
You said you make a discovery every day.

49:43.115 --> 49:43.295
Yes.

49:43.796 --> 49:48.804
Every day is not right.

49:49.445 --> 49:50.286
It's too much.

49:50.987 --> 49:52.950
But I say that I have

49:53.251 --> 49:54.132
and old books.

49:54.813 --> 49:55.654
I read the books.

49:57.137 --> 49:57.818
You read the books.

49:58.459 --> 50:03.005
And do you have a staff over there?

50:03.886 --> 50:05.268
Yes, yes.

50:05.849 --> 50:06.730
You read the books.

50:07.371 --> 50:10.836
And their responsibility is to read the books that come in?

50:11.437 --> 50:14.682
Yes, he collects, but more because he collects, he reads.

50:16.925 --> 50:22.313
But of course, you must sell complete books or you must collect the books.

50:23.170 --> 50:26.694
Make the collection.

50:26.714 --> 50:32.140
You must make the collection.

50:33.041 --> 50:39.988
But you must read.

50:40.008 --> 50:49.819
Of course, in the books, but it's not, it's ridiculous to read.

50:52.381 --> 51:15.642
but you don't read an edition of Dante Alighieri, of William Shakespeare, but you read of a little scientific man or a collection of letters, old letters of a strange book.

51:17.584 --> 51:22.388
And then how do you, if it's something you've never heard of before, how do you

51:22.823 --> 51:25.706
transmit this knowledge to a prospective client?

51:27.088 --> 51:30.051
I have descriptions.

51:31.733 --> 51:35.538
Every book is with a very long description.

51:36.018 --> 51:41.384
So even though you don't do a catalogue, you do write a full description of every book?

51:41.404 --> 51:41.624
Exactly.

51:41.845 --> 51:44.788
Much more than you find in a catalogue.

51:44.808 --> 51:48.753
Sometimes I read ten pages on a book.

51:50.114 --> 51:52.217
You write ten pages on a book?

51:52.237 --> 51:52.577
That's amazing.

51:52.844 --> 51:59.515
But not in rapport of the price.

52:01.638 --> 52:03.020
For the information.

52:03.040 --> 52:19.005
Father, because I want that somebody that buys books, he knows all what I was able to transmit to him.

52:19.025 --> 52:20.708
But also, for instance,

52:21.160 --> 52:29.051
a librarian or a curator and I made a description of a manuscript.

52:30.493 --> 52:47.758
I must give him more information as possible because he must in five minutes or ten minutes, in this ten page that I write, know

52:48.211 --> 53:10.491
all that I can't transmit all from the book after, because, because our librarian that he knows exactly one text, one problem, but our also librarian that he cannot know all.

53:10.991 --> 53:16.716
So I must give the information to give the possibility

53:17.624 --> 53:26.394
after, to the librarian, to curator, to work easy.

53:26.414 --> 53:32.601
Because you have a study, he starts from my note.

53:34.523 --> 53:36.565
You've got a very good beginning.

53:36.605 --> 53:45.775
You must have a very large reference library.

53:46.379 --> 53:48.561
Sixty thousand.

53:48.581 --> 53:49.763
Are they over here?

53:50.764 --> 53:56.490
Yes.

53:56.510 --> 53:57.291
Also little.

53:59.213 --> 54:12.387
Not only in bibliography, because of course I have all the bibliographies of interest, directly or indirectly, Italian books.

54:13.885 --> 54:29.482
but all the study of a little poet, of a little illustrator, of a neat typograph.

54:29.943 --> 54:43.217
I have so a large study of typographs, Italian typographs,

54:46.555 --> 55:04.051
The French have an expression they use for their collections, they call it, they collect French patrimony.

55:04.932 --> 55:06.874
Patrimony, are you familiar with that word?

55:07.535 --> 55:07.935
Patrimony.

55:08.075 --> 55:09.877
Patrimony, yeah.

55:11.038 --> 55:14.441
Do you do a similar thing in Italy, I wonder?

55:14.461 --> 55:15.482
I think where you collect

55:16.103 --> 55:19.330
It's a national pride.

55:19.731 --> 55:23.418
Items that reflect on your culture, your literature, your heritage.

55:24.500 --> 55:31.014
Of course, the French use that word to keep things in the country that they don't want to leave.

55:31.054 --> 55:34.922
They say, this is a patrimonial item, you know.

55:35.105 --> 55:36.927
a French patrimonial item.

55:38.790 --> 55:39.631
I guess not.

55:39.651 --> 55:40.272
That's okay.

55:41.173 --> 55:49.104
You intend in the patriotic sense, or what?

55:49.384 --> 55:51.227
More than that.

55:51.247 --> 55:54.211
It's like a national treasure and it can't leave the country.

55:54.751 --> 55:56.814
Ah, yes, yes.

55:56.834 --> 55:58.316
Yes, this was in Italy.

55:59.057 --> 56:02.562
You have the sovraintendencia bibliographic.

56:03.103 --> 56:04.825
It's more in Italy than in France.

56:05.210 --> 56:05.931
Really?

56:06.691 --> 56:07.072
Yes.

56:07.973 --> 56:18.983
Could you tell us a little bit about that?

56:19.003 --> 56:21.545
Do you know the bookseller Herbert Tentschert?

56:21.565 --> 56:24.668
Have you ever heard of him, the fellow in Switzerland?

56:24.688 --> 56:25.249
Tentschert.

56:25.909 --> 56:26.410
Yes.

56:26.690 --> 56:30.194
Well, they did it recently.

56:30.254 --> 56:32.736
He's German, but he's in Switzerland.

56:32.856 --> 56:33.917
He lived in Switzerland.

56:34.285 --> 56:40.935
He does these huge catalogues that are quite unbelievable.

56:42.037 --> 56:45.442
But I'm so impressed that you feel that you don't have to do a catalogue.

56:45.562 --> 56:48.106
The book speaks for itself, I guess.

56:48.186 --> 56:58.502
Yes, but the difference is that Tangier is a very rich man, and I am not a very rich man.

56:58.783 --> 57:01.086
Sounds like it's very interesting.

57:05.437 --> 57:10.023
You know what, Connie, do you think that we've... I don't want to try anything.

57:10.123 --> 57:15.650
I know that... No, but... You want to know in each moment for more.

57:16.891 --> 57:18.013
I'm very happy.

57:18.073 --> 57:23.620
I really don't want to oppose it, your hospitality and... No.

57:23.840 --> 57:28.726
You've been very good.

57:29.827 --> 57:31.049
You want a little drink?

57:31.609 --> 57:33.171
I don't think so, actually.

57:33.191 --> 57:33.672
Thank you.

57:34.327 --> 57:34.848
Thank you.

57:34.868 --> 57:40.896
Don't forget, we've been up all night flying, so I think another drink and I'd fall asleep.

57:40.916 --> 57:46.222
You lost the night or you sleep something?

57:47.624 --> 57:50.308
No, it's very difficult to sleep.

57:50.328 --> 57:51.890
It's very exciting to be here, though.

57:51.930 --> 57:53.792
You will sleep tonight.

57:53.832 --> 57:55.094
This is such a treat.

57:55.615 --> 57:56.676
We were talking about this.

57:56.756 --> 58:01.262
I said to my wife, of course, she's been following the itinerary.

58:01.360 --> 58:05.546
And I said we have a special treat in store in Milano.

58:06.066 --> 58:08.249
Are we far from the Arbrosiana?

58:08.510 --> 58:09.791
Not so far.

58:09.811 --> 58:11.253
Not so far.

58:11.494 --> 58:12.074
Ten minutes.

58:13.136 --> 58:13.536
Five minutes.

58:14.337 --> 58:15.679
Oh, really?

58:15.699 --> 58:20.686
I told them I might stop by about three o'clock this afternoon.

58:21.407 --> 58:26.334
And after you go to Arbrosiana?

58:26.354 --> 58:27.175
They're open until 5.30.

58:27.555 --> 58:28.937
You must go.

58:29.795 --> 58:40.177
While you come out here, on your left, put the left, you find him and you.

58:41.299 --> 58:46.690
If you go always, always, always, always straight down,
