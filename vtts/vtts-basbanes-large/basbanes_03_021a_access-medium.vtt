WEBVTT

00:02.815 --> 00:04.837
Thank you very much, Bob.

00:04.857 --> 00:09.182
I know you're too insistent on you, Bob, but I have to say I am humble in your presence.

00:09.202 --> 00:10.643
No, no, no, no.

00:10.663 --> 00:12.385
Listen, I'm like you.

00:12.465 --> 00:16.490
I'm just trying to put some words out of my age.

00:17.931 --> 00:19.813
You've done so much.

00:19.973 --> 00:22.516
You know, I've lived longer than Walker did.

00:23.978 --> 00:30.865
Walker died, I think he, well, he died, I think he was around 70.

00:32.397 --> 00:34.019
Wasn't he?

00:34.079 --> 00:35.741
Don't forget, he'd been sick, of course.

00:36.261 --> 00:37.242
He looked 70, too.

00:37.303 --> 00:39.485
I mean, he was an old 70.

00:40.106 --> 00:43.830
My father died last year at 91, and he was a young 91, you know.

00:43.850 --> 00:45.872
And that's his Jaguar out there.

00:45.892 --> 00:47.914
I just got it, you know.

00:47.934 --> 00:53.961
It was 1971, and when he died, it became mine, but not until it was.

00:53.981 --> 00:56.604
You know, I want to tell you something about Walker.

00:57.986 --> 00:59.147
He died out in William.

00:59.785 --> 01:02.908
metastasized.

01:04.630 --> 01:09.736
He had gone for a checkup, and they told him everything was fine.

01:09.876 --> 01:10.396
That's terrible.

01:11.558 --> 01:13.300
He called me up afterwards.

01:14.261 --> 01:15.902
He said, they missed it.

01:17.324 --> 01:18.866
That's the way he started the thing.

01:18.886 --> 01:20.287
I said, who is that?

01:20.307 --> 01:21.649
What's going on here?

01:21.669 --> 01:25.793
And then he went on to explain.

01:26.110 --> 01:34.379
For a guy who had that whole religious and existentialist, I was surprised at how tough, well, why should I be?

01:34.399 --> 01:36.221
But he went to the Mayo Clinic.

01:36.362 --> 01:38.384
I mean, he tried.

01:38.584 --> 01:40.506
But he'd been through that, of course, with TV.

01:40.606 --> 01:46.753
I mean, and he had done the same kind of perseverance and demonstrated the same level of courage, I think.

01:46.914 --> 01:47.835
Yeah.

01:48.816 --> 01:50.818
And he fought.

01:51.322 --> 01:54.606
I went to see him at the end to say goodbye, really.

01:54.706 --> 01:55.667
I flew down there.

01:55.747 --> 01:58.269
It's horrible.

01:58.570 --> 02:02.634
He was closest then to an African-American woman who was taking care of him.

02:02.654 --> 02:05.177
It's a southern story.

02:05.437 --> 02:14.567
Of course, Buck was there and his children, but she, in that bedroom, took care of him.

02:16.309 --> 02:20.113
Anyway, he was...

02:20.330 --> 02:22.413
Wait a minute, let's see if I can get it right.

02:22.433 --> 02:32.147
I think he was born in 1916, and he died in 1989, somehow that's 1620.

02:32.167 --> 02:35.972
Yeah, he was a little over seven years.

02:35.992 --> 02:39.958
Since we began with Walker Percy, I mean, I certainly have Walker Percy, William Carlos,

02:40.124 --> 02:41.586
Williams, Flannery, O'Connor.

02:41.666 --> 02:42.507
What are those three names?

02:43.187 --> 02:46.951
I mean, when I say those three names, what's the association of thoughts?

02:47.172 --> 02:49.074
Thoughts are the only one they're aware.

02:49.094 --> 03:01.827
I had a note from William Collins Williams just before he died when his wife, Arcee, told him what I was hoping to do.

03:02.728 --> 03:06.452
Because, you know, he died in 1963.

03:06.871 --> 03:11.836
And I was just getting started in that whole civil rights work.

03:13.098 --> 03:19.124
And he told her, you know, he nodded and he said, that's good.

03:19.164 --> 03:25.331
She later told him, you know, he'd had a stroke.

03:25.571 --> 03:28.354
I wouldn't be sitting and talking to you if I hadn't been for him.

03:28.414 --> 03:30.176
It's an extraordinary story.

03:30.336 --> 03:34.701
And I know it's been told a number of times, but you talk about

03:35.137 --> 03:41.964
I told you what he sent me back on the prescription?

03:42.004 --> 03:44.987
No, I told you that.

03:45.007 --> 03:54.297
I gotâ€”Perry Miller got me to send my thesis, my essay to him, which I wasâ€” Now, this is your senior thesis, right?

03:54.317 --> 03:56.159
Yeah, and I said, I can't do that.

03:56.179 --> 04:01.745
And Miller said to me, you don't have enough money for the poster.

04:01.765 --> 04:02.005
So I'm sad.

04:02.643 --> 04:04.145
I just can't bother him.

04:04.245 --> 04:09.353
He said, did it ever occur to you that he might be interested and want to have an undergraduate?

04:09.613 --> 04:13.819
He has no use for this place, and you should pay attention to his dislike.

04:14.500 --> 04:16.763
You could at least send him that.

04:16.863 --> 04:20.348
Anyway, I sent it to him, and I got back.

04:21.029 --> 04:28.560
William C. Williams, MD, 9 Ridge Road, Rutherford, New Jersey.

04:28.580 --> 04:29.882
Dear Mr. Coles,

04:31.870 --> 04:34.012
Thank you for your writing about me.

04:34.693 --> 04:35.213
Dash.

04:35.794 --> 04:38.817
Not bad for a Harvard student.

04:38.837 --> 04:40.138
That's wonderful.

04:40.158 --> 04:43.722
This has kind of shaped so much of your own outlook, hasn't it?

04:43.782 --> 04:53.031
I mean, what I read about, you don't have a disdain for this whole horror of the ivory tower intellectual elite here, but it does amuse you.

04:53.131 --> 04:59.177
And I wonder if this kind of, if not disdain, this

04:59.883 --> 05:08.074
I don't know if I'm choosing the right word, but I wonder if it begins with Williamson, the influence that he may have had on him.

05:08.434 --> 05:13.802
Well, it's because of him that I took pre-med courses and went to medical school.

05:14.002 --> 05:18.568
And I really wanted to be a doctor, per se, right?

05:18.628 --> 05:22.053
I had no intention of becoming a physician, but I learned for him.

05:23.234 --> 05:27.460
My ambition in high school and college

05:27.760 --> 05:31.124
was in some way to teach English.

05:32.485 --> 05:36.630
My favorite teachers in high school were the teachers of English.

05:37.651 --> 05:45.780
My father came from England, and my father was from Yorkshire, and my father and mother used to read to one another.

05:45.860 --> 05:48.984
That's how I got into all of this.

05:49.484 --> 05:51.526
If you want the psychoanalytic back.

05:51.867 --> 05:54.450
Which you're qualified to offer, I think.

05:54.570 --> 05:56.212
I got into it.

05:56.272 --> 05:57.413
I got into this.

05:57.848 --> 06:00.070
remembering them reading to one another.

06:00.110 --> 06:03.653
My father would read from Dickens, especially, which he loved.

06:03.673 --> 06:04.634
Oh, he loved.

06:05.615 --> 06:07.337
And he'd read from Hardy.

06:07.857 --> 06:08.438
Read aloud?

06:08.898 --> 06:09.219
Yeah.

06:09.239 --> 06:09.719
To your mother?

06:09.779 --> 06:10.980
To the obscurity.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.702
Read aloud, then she'd read aloud.

06:12.762 --> 06:14.163
And you and your wife did the same thing.

06:14.824 --> 06:15.384
What?

06:15.404 --> 06:16.966
You and your wife did the same thing.

06:17.106 --> 06:17.486
Yes.

06:17.907 --> 06:20.309
My wife was a high school English teacher.

06:20.369 --> 06:26.995
And my brother, by the way, became an English professor of English at the University of Michigan.

06:27.582 --> 06:30.145
So this is in the family.

06:30.165 --> 06:31.786
But I mean, this reading aloud.

06:32.287 --> 06:37.072
This book I'm working on has its working title, Every Book is Reader.

06:37.092 --> 06:43.458
And it's a long, discressive look into the continuing power of books.

06:43.558 --> 06:46.902
I mean, everybody's got a reading book, but this is mine.

06:47.342 --> 06:53.168
At the core of what I'm doing are a few of the great thinkers that I admire most.

06:53.840 --> 06:55.082
in the world.

06:55.102 --> 07:08.361
You've been one of them talking a little bit, not only about the power of reading, the power of storytelling, the power of narrative, and how it has really driven you to become the person that you are and to accomplish the things that you have.

07:09.222 --> 07:09.482
No.

07:10.364 --> 07:12.567
That's my opening statement.

07:12.587 --> 07:16.793
No, listen, I'm with you, and the more that you do, the better.

07:17.153 --> 07:22.581
You know, we need to know, Mrs. Look, as to draw and walk up.

07:22.966 --> 07:38.345
We're the creature of language, and through language we affirm ourselves and find out about the world, including ourselves, the words, and we share with one another through language.

07:39.066 --> 07:48.698
When you began to really learn about Walker and Dr. Williams and Flannery O'Connor, did it help you to know what they had read?

07:48.899 --> 07:52.483
We talked about how reading energizes a life.

07:52.970 --> 07:56.654
Did you learn anything about their reading?

07:56.674 --> 07:57.235
About who?

07:57.275 --> 08:00.098
Their reading, the people who you were writing about.

08:00.279 --> 08:00.959
Oh, yes.

08:00.999 --> 08:01.640
Learning about.

08:02.681 --> 08:13.494
Well, Walker, who, of course, turned to Dostoevsky and Tolstoy and the whole range of literature, English, American, Russian.

08:15.136 --> 08:21.323
Flora O'Connor I learned about, partially from her letters, but I spoke with her mother at great length.

08:22.450 --> 08:25.093
and went down there to Milledgeville and talked with her.

08:25.113 --> 08:26.095
Of course, she had died.

08:26.135 --> 08:26.916
I never met her.

08:27.677 --> 08:38.070
But her mother, when she heard that I came from Concord, Robert Fitzgerald had written her a note, which is how I got to see her.

08:38.751 --> 08:45.720
And I'll never forget, she said, if you're from Concord, I hope you know half of one.

08:47.142 --> 08:48.083
I said, yes.

08:48.203 --> 08:50.586
I told her I lived in it.

08:50.886 --> 08:51.327
She said,

08:51.678 --> 08:54.505
Flannery had no great interest.

08:55.267 --> 08:56.169
She was tactful.

08:56.570 --> 08:59.858
She had no great interest in Emerson and Thoreau.

09:00.138 --> 09:01.301
It was Hawthorne.

09:02.063 --> 09:05.952
So I thought to myself, of course, you know.

09:05.973 --> 09:07.657
Well, of course, how did you come to that?

09:08.098 --> 09:09.501
Why the of course?

09:09.987 --> 09:18.019
But then the story, as she said, she thought that they were like a lot of people today, as far as she would go.

09:18.099 --> 09:19.882
You mean the Hawthorne characters?

09:20.062 --> 09:21.525
No, the Emerson.

09:21.545 --> 09:22.206
Oh, the Emerson.

09:22.226 --> 09:22.847
Oh, okay, yeah.

09:22.867 --> 09:26.532
Of course, she didn't dare say to me, the liberal do-gooder.

09:30.118 --> 09:31.259
But Hawthorne was okay?

09:31.920 --> 09:34.965
Hawthorne, yes, because he was more...

09:35.333 --> 09:51.230
religious and conservative and skeptical about contemporary life then in the 19th century, less hopefully man-centered or secular or whatever it is.

09:51.810 --> 09:58.958
When you say that Walker all of a sudden embraced all of these panoply of writing, was it an epiphany for him?

09:59.378 --> 10:00.880
For Walker?

10:00.900 --> 10:05.104
For Walker?

10:06.232 --> 10:07.073
That's a good question.

10:07.113 --> 10:33.285
I think it was his interest in reading, which preceded his writing, his sense of tragedy, which he'd experienced, after all, father, a suicide, mother in an accident that took an orphan, really, is what he became, all too young for this.

10:34.143 --> 10:51.364
And I think through novels he found kindred spirits, those who would, the writing, the writers who could conjure up this world helped him to understand his own world and also made him feel less lonely.

10:51.945 --> 10:56.030
Because, you know, when you read, you are in the company of another person.

10:56.651 --> 11:01.737
The other person's words and thoughts become part of yours.

11:02.999 --> 11:04.421
and connect with you.

11:04.561 --> 11:09.307
And reading, in my opinion, is a kind of human connection.

11:09.808 --> 11:26.290
It's an embrace of another person's words, thoughts, ideas, suggestions, premises, worries, concerns, the whole list of nouns is what I think

11:26.590 --> 11:52.615
reading enables and prompts in a person. Is this something that you had mentioned the first time we spoke? I mean I can't believe it's seven years ago. The time does fly. That what you learned from your mother and I believe also from your father was that was that this cup this idea of taking hold of stories that you could live your life by and and I wonder uh we really didn't pursue that much further than than that observation if it's been really eighteen, estimated?

11:52.865 --> 11:58.400
Well, I did.

11:58.640 --> 12:06.722
You know, my father went to MIT, and he was a scientist.

12:07.192 --> 12:18.788
Buddy was a scientist who had gone to school in England and who was familiar with the English novelists and essayists.

12:19.429 --> 12:31.326
My mother came from the Midwest, and her father, well her family, they were farmers and then had become storekeepers or whatever, but she came from Sioux City, Iowa.

12:31.306 --> 12:34.669
to Boston, as my father came to Boston from Yorkshire.

12:35.090 --> 12:40.655
But my mother had read because she liked to go to the library to read.

12:41.516 --> 12:44.139
And in fact, I have an early memory that's interesting.

12:44.159 --> 12:47.662
My mother always encouraged me to go to the library and my brother.

12:47.702 --> 12:52.627
And one day, I went to the Milton Library.

12:52.667 --> 12:56.571
No, it was actually the Mattapan Branch Library over the

12:57.293 --> 12:59.976
extension of Boston and Borders of Milton.

13:00.957 --> 13:02.058
I still remember it.

13:02.698 --> 13:07.683
I went to the library, and the library was quite gall, was divided into three parts.

13:08.243 --> 13:14.069
There was the children's room, the high school's room, and the adult room.

13:15.190 --> 13:18.053
I used to wander in those various rooms.

13:18.914 --> 13:24.499
And one day, the librarian, whose name I still remember, Pauline O'Meara,

13:25.137 --> 13:27.740
M-E-A-R-A, O-M-E-A-R-A.

13:27.880 --> 13:29.362
Oh, possibly, M-E-A-R-A.

13:29.502 --> 13:42.578
Now, at my age, I remember a librarian I knew when I was seven or eight years old, but she came up to me and told me that I should not be in the adult room, I should be in the children's room.

13:42.598 --> 13:44.400
I went home and told my mother this.

13:45.642 --> 13:55.093
Within a day or two, my mother went with me to the library, and I can still see that conversation, if not confrontation.

13:55.664 --> 14:03.791
And my mother told the librarian that she would like me to go into any of the rooms that I chose to and read any of the books.

14:04.132 --> 14:10.878
And the librarian then told her that I couldn't read all these books or take any of them out because I wasn't old enough.

14:11.218 --> 14:23.629
And my mother said, if you're going to do this, I'm going to come here with him and sit in the adult room and wait for him to choose whatever books you'd like to take home, and I won't take them home on my card.

14:24.470 --> 14:26.774
I still remember that.

14:27.395 --> 14:42.660
I remember the librarian nodding, and I remember, I will say, this feeling of triumph, that I could now go any place I wanted in that library, including, I used to go into the adult room and read the newspapers.

14:43.120 --> 14:47.027
They were on these old-fashioned polls, right, that you could be hearing.

14:47.047 --> 14:49.751
Like they said at the YMCA, these old polls.

14:49.771 --> 14:51.574
And I was turning the pages and

14:51.875 --> 15:00.045
And it was as if I'd been given permission, first by my parents of course, and then by the whole world

15:00.397 --> 15:02.419
to read and read and read.

15:02.439 --> 15:03.981
And did you exercise the privilege?

15:04.161 --> 15:08.866
I did, and I took some, they let me take whatever books I want.

15:08.886 --> 15:13.611
Do you remember some of the books, the previously forbidden books that you now want?

15:13.631 --> 15:18.336
Well, I remember the books of William L. Shira, of all things.

15:18.556 --> 15:23.442
Now, you might say, what is a seven or eight year, but they thought it's seven or eight, I guess I shouldn't be reading.

15:23.462 --> 15:24.863
Well, I can't understand, yeah.

15:25.244 --> 15:29.408
I remember William L. Shira and his inside, inside, inside books.

15:29.894 --> 15:31.297
And he was in print already?

15:31.377 --> 15:33.721
And John Gunther was another.

15:33.821 --> 15:35.164
John Gunther, of course, yeah.

15:35.184 --> 15:41.315
And Halliburton, I think, was more, they thought, was more for young adults rather than children.

15:41.596 --> 15:43.980
But I was a great fan of Richard Halliburton.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.743
But you were focusing on non-fiction.

15:46.364 --> 15:48.608
Yes, I was focusing on non-fiction.

15:49.109 --> 15:50.552
So at what point...

15:50.937 --> 15:57.948
Does the storytelling, the fiction, enter into a call of stories, to be a point of phrase?

15:58.149 --> 16:06.722
At home, I heard the fiction at home in the sense that my parents would read novels to one another or excerpts.

16:06.742 --> 16:16.438
I still recall my mother and father contemplating Jude Fawley in Jude the Obscure.

16:16.756 --> 16:29.933
And I remember my mother saying to me, this was a young man who had all kinds of abilities, but who was being brushed aside because he was from the poor.

16:30.594 --> 16:34.719
Now, this is prophetic, given the work I played to do.

16:34.739 --> 16:40.587
But I remember this, and I remember Jude, and of course I ended up teaching Jude the Obscure to college students.

16:41.225 --> 16:59.349
and lecturing from the novel, but also out of the remembrance of my own experience with my parents and with myself as a boy, now a teenager, older, and definitely reading Jude the Obscure.

17:00.070 --> 17:05.517
Then I remember my father introducing me to George Eliot and Middlemarsh.

17:05.537 --> 17:07.379
That's a tough book.

17:07.399 --> 17:08.481
I was in high school.

17:08.921 --> 17:10.303
It was, as I told them,

17:10.553 --> 17:11.414
too long.

17:13.435 --> 17:22.683
Just as I thought War and Peace was too long, and the Brothers Karamazov too long, I even told Walker Percy that once.

17:22.763 --> 17:26.987
I said, you know, I was going through a lot of work in those books.

17:27.007 --> 17:28.789
But my parents were willing to do it.

17:28.809 --> 17:30.330
They knew how to excerpt.

17:31.351 --> 17:39.818
And when they got to a paragraph or a sentence that meant something, this gets me even now choked up, they'd read it again.

17:40.220 --> 17:44.668
So that they would together savor the message.

17:45.009 --> 17:45.730
Wonderful.

17:45.750 --> 17:47.774
And this is what I find myself doing now.

17:47.834 --> 17:54.186
I'll stumble into something even in the newspaper or in a magazine, and I just keep going back to it.

17:54.647 --> 17:55.489
Do you read it aloud?

17:56.170 --> 17:56.771
No, I don't.

17:56.831 --> 17:58.735
I read it just to myself.

17:59.035 --> 18:02.600
See, my wife and I used to do this with one another.

18:02.640 --> 18:12.433
She was a high school English teacher, as you know, and as I've said, and we used to read around, but then she died, and so I read to myself.

18:13.214 --> 18:14.235
But I do read.

18:14.275 --> 18:28.114
I did read to my children, and now I read to my grandchildren, and I sit with them and read, and they listen, and when their heads nod for me, I'm in heaven.

18:28.752 --> 18:42.255
When I have a child beside me, nodding, who has gotten a certain message that I am conveying as an intermediary from the writer of a book, even if it's a children's book like Rental,

18:42.657 --> 18:47.643
Lentil is a children's book, but it's also a story about something that happens.

18:48.184 --> 18:51.408
The boy from Alto, Ohio, what happens to him.

18:51.428 --> 18:58.918
And when I see my grandson nodding, I say, this is an affirmation of our humanity.

18:59.578 --> 19:02.582
His, mine, all of our humanity.

19:03.163 --> 19:08.570
Was it your work with children or this lifelong passion for reading?

19:08.810 --> 19:11.854
I'm just wondering at what point you begin to formulate this

19:12.357 --> 19:22.279
this concept of how important narrative and storytelling is to teach medical students and physicians and helping them become better doctors, better human beings.

19:22.639 --> 19:24.944
I wonder what comes first and how that develops?

19:25.025 --> 19:27.109
Well, you know, when I was a medical student,

19:28.692 --> 19:57.754
I used to bring books with me to the anatomy lab because I couldn't take some of the science without some modification, so I'd bring a book of poems to anatomy or histology or physiology, and I figure if I could just take a minute off and look at a poem, that'll help me get through these labs, not being a very good either pre-med or med student in the formal academic sense.

19:58.139 --> 20:15.361
But even there in medical school, I remember one or two teachers who had a certain interest in not only conveying knowledge or factuality, but wanted to tell stories, stories that some of their patients had told them about themselves.

20:15.461 --> 20:19.426
I particularly remember Yale Neyland, who was a professor of medicine.

20:19.446 --> 20:20.628
In fact, I've written about him.

20:21.048 --> 20:24.973
I wrote a piece about him, I think, in the American Poetry Review about...

20:25.223 --> 20:34.394
about 20 years ago, but he stands out because of his storytelling ability as a lecturer and a teacher and a physician.

20:34.434 --> 20:49.233
And then, of course, across the Hudson River when I was in medical school was Dr. Williams, dying, but nevertheless, Patterson was there, Rutherford was there, all New Jersey that he had showed me.

20:50.034 --> 20:55.180
And I could remember that, and I had Patterson close to me, and I would read

20:55.430 --> 21:02.182
a line, another line, and somehow it was like nourishment.

21:02.362 --> 21:08.093
It was like taking vitamin pills and therefore being able to be a bit stronger.

21:08.113 --> 21:12.821
So your life clearly takes a totally different turn if it's not for Dr. Williams.

21:13.703 --> 21:17.510
A totally different turn if it's not for William Carlos Williams.

21:17.770 --> 21:18.872
Oh, there's no question.

21:19.105 --> 21:24.513
I think if it hadn't been for Williams, well, not a totally different turn.

21:24.533 --> 21:25.615
You'd have been teaching English.

21:25.735 --> 21:27.258
I would have been an English teacher.

21:28.299 --> 21:39.316
I was asked what I would hope to be when I was a senior in high school, Boston Latin School, after six years of Latin and three years of Greek, not to mention France.

21:39.336 --> 21:42.802
I mean, a classical education that prepared me to go to college.

21:42.842 --> 21:46.868
But I remember at that time saying to people,

21:47.253 --> 21:56.746
that I liked to be a high school English teacher, and I even now can remember my high school English teachers, much more so than all the other teachers.

21:57.467 --> 22:03.976
I remember reading Dickens at their behest.

22:04.757 --> 22:06.279
I remember reading some poems.

22:06.399 --> 22:10.485
I remember being introduced to Emily Dickinson by one of them.

22:11.546 --> 22:15.792
I mean, these were important people in my thinking-wise, and then, of course,

22:16.177 --> 22:36.308
In my college life, I was taking English literature courses and got very close to Perry Miller, who was the great historian as well as teacher of literature and who changed my life by enabling me to work on Williams when that was a controversial act within the English department at that time.

22:36.388 --> 22:38.151
Believe me, he wasn't taught.

22:38.131 --> 22:41.055
This is Harvard in the 1940s and 50s.

22:41.396 --> 22:44.500
They probably didn't teach any living poets at that point.

22:46.362 --> 22:49.907
That they taught him, you can be sure.

22:49.947 --> 22:53.052
But that's right.

22:53.112 --> 23:01.263
So somebody had the courage then at Harvard to encourage you to say, you know, Bob, this is maybe something.

23:01.283 --> 23:03.827
Courage on his part to encourage me.

23:03.987 --> 23:07.632
Miller's courage, the encouragement of a student.

23:08.168 --> 23:23.920
And then my decision that if I felt so impressed by, enamored of Dr. Williams' way of dealing with life, I decided I should try to go to medical school.

23:23.940 --> 23:27.207
So I took these, hurriedly, these pre-med courses.

23:28.739 --> 23:33.988
And I still remember the interview at Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons.

23:34.589 --> 23:50.336
I was interviewed, this is a story in itself, I was interviewed by a biochemist there who asked me questions, and then he said, why would you want to come to this medical school?

23:50.757 --> 23:52.620
I said, well, it's in New York City.

23:53.005 --> 24:02.322
I can cross the Hudson if Dr. Williams continues to live and say hello, or even if he dies, I'll be near where he lived.

24:02.763 --> 24:06.249
And I remember he wrote down, near where he lived.

24:07.131 --> 24:09.195
I still remember that.

24:09.876 --> 24:10.998
And he smiled at me.

24:11.018 --> 24:11.419
He said,

24:12.007 --> 24:15.492
I'm going to tell the committee that they should take a chance of you.

24:15.813 --> 24:20.920
Well, again, this is a moment of perception on the part of the person.

24:21.581 --> 24:27.289
This is the kind of guy we should have, you know, because you don't want everybody stamped out of the same mold.

24:28.511 --> 24:29.092
Whatever.

24:29.152 --> 24:39.066
That's what I knew I was accepted, which was a bit of a miracle, given the fact that I was not exactly the promising Nobel scientist that they all were.

24:39.467 --> 24:41.490
I have to believe that you are one of the

24:41.707 --> 24:45.891
their most distinguished alums, and they're so proud of it.

24:45.911 --> 24:48.914
Well, I mean, these are honors and stuff like that.

24:49.174 --> 24:49.935
But that's a way to develop it.

24:49.955 --> 24:55.400
But I mean, in terms of what you, the way you directed, the way you directed your work.

24:55.840 --> 25:03.007
You know, I've read a number of essays and interviews with you and reviews and our own conversations.

25:03.207 --> 25:10.414
The word character, your use of the word character, it's a motif, it seems, through everything.

25:10.613 --> 25:12.275
There's my mother talking.

25:13.517 --> 25:38.629
There's my mother talking with her interest in spiritual matters and religion and prayer and the lessons that she would give us about behavior and that good is so important and that, in fact, she knew to tell us what Emerson, quoting from Emerson, that character is higher than intellect.

25:38.980 --> 25:56.596
The character, and I for years have quoted that from Emerson in my lectures, that character is higher than, to tell a group of Harvard students, including oneself as a Harvard student, the character is higher than intellect, is I think a bit of a statement.

25:56.616 --> 26:06.845
Well, in one long interview I saw with you, you reminded your questioner that, remember, that Dr. Goebbels had a PhD in comparative literature.

26:06.865 --> 26:07.165
That's right.

26:07.533 --> 26:11.498
You know, I got that from Perry Miller.

26:12.179 --> 26:15.183
Perry Miller used to remind us of those matters.

26:15.924 --> 26:18.567
The gerbils had the PhD, that's right.

26:18.887 --> 26:20.269
And he also went further.

26:20.650 --> 26:32.865
He reminded us that in Germany in 1933 and before, when Hitler took over, that Germany had the highest per capita ratio of high school

26:33.031 --> 26:34.433
and college graduates.

26:34.713 --> 26:36.995
It was the best educated nation in the world.

26:37.396 --> 26:44.684
It also had very high church-going attendance, both among the Lutherans and, of course, the Catholics.

26:45.184 --> 26:54.034
And Mill would say, next time someone tells you that the world is going to be better because of education and prayer, you point to Germany.

26:54.074 --> 26:54.294
Really.

26:54.494 --> 26:57.678
I mentioned that once to Elie Wiesel, and he said it goes beyond Goebbels.

26:57.718 --> 27:01.722
He said you'd be amazed at how many senior officers in the SS

27:01.853 --> 27:04.698
You know, colonels and whatever it was who had PhDs.

27:04.838 --> 27:05.459
That's right.

27:05.720 --> 27:07.383
I mean, it goes well beyond Goebbels.

27:07.463 --> 27:11.670
I mean, you had the whole officer corps, the senior officer corps.

27:11.691 --> 27:12.292
That's right.

27:12.312 --> 27:16.559
And easily the most evil police unit ever in general.

27:16.579 --> 27:17.140
Locked together.

27:18.423 --> 27:21.568
Exquisitely well-educated and beautifully read.

27:21.969 --> 27:22.630
But then...

27:23.116 --> 27:26.081
The element of character, I guess, comes into play.

27:27.103 --> 27:29.266
By the way, I've taught Elie Wiesel for years.

27:29.366 --> 27:29.927
I teach it.

27:30.348 --> 27:38.121
In my course, we'd read Night, Elie Wiesel's Night, and we'd read Dorothy Day's

27:38.590 --> 27:43.899
and the students used to nickname that whole part of the course Night and Day.

27:43.919 --> 27:45.141
Night and Day.

27:45.161 --> 27:50.891
Is this in Guilt 105, too?

27:50.911 --> 27:54.557
Yes, it's called Night and Day in Guilt 105.

27:54.537 --> 27:56.481
I love Eliot.

27:56.882 --> 27:57.623
I know Eliot.

27:57.643 --> 27:58.265
He's wonderful.

27:58.305 --> 27:59.187
What a gift.

27:59.467 --> 28:06.061
He's a gift to us, as Anne Frank was, because out of that horror they could tell stories.

28:06.642 --> 28:08.205
That's what the two of them did.

28:08.686 --> 28:14.318
They somehow redeemed the horror of Nazi hell.

28:14.298 --> 28:18.222
in a storytelling manner that we all remember.

28:18.322 --> 28:19.223
That we all remember.

28:19.383 --> 28:22.947
And reminds us, it actually goes beyond remembering, doesn't it?

28:23.067 --> 28:26.670
That's right, beyond contemplation and reflection.

28:27.071 --> 28:33.918
And they are witnesses through a diary, through a novel.

28:33.978 --> 28:39.723
They are witnesses to help as it visited us.

28:40.844 --> 28:43.427
And I always like, on the flip side of Dr. Goebbels,

28:43.627 --> 28:47.831
having a Ph.D., that Abraham Lincoln never went beyond the second grade.

28:47.851 --> 28:48.452
That's right.

28:49.032 --> 28:59.342
Easily, easily one of our very best-read presidents, certainly one of our greatest thinking presidents, and read Latin, and he was wonderful.

28:59.503 --> 29:02.105
Well, there's a good one.

29:02.125 --> 29:04.928
I should remember, because it's a very important one.

29:05.028 --> 29:06.309
Interesting, isn't it?

29:06.389 --> 29:09.212
But character, I mean, what president had more character than

29:09.597 --> 29:11.680
And also was a storyteller.

29:11.700 --> 29:16.367
I mean, on his day, they loved the fact that he told stories.

29:16.688 --> 29:26.503
And then you wonder whether this kind of person who Lincoln was these days could survive the way we are.

29:27.264 --> 29:35.537
The newspaper stories, the criticism, the savagery of daily life, so to speak, as it is.

29:35.905 --> 29:39.528
enacted in our journals and newspapers.

29:39.548 --> 29:40.809
On a daily basis.

29:40.849 --> 29:43.211
Not to mention television and whatever else.

29:43.231 --> 29:51.678
I mean, you wonder what a privilege it was in those times not to have all this kind of stuff available.

29:52.259 --> 30:00.206
On the one hand, you encourage your students, and you've taught in a law school, the medical school, the business school, throughout the university.

30:00.226 --> 30:00.666
Yes.

30:00.686 --> 30:05.170
And you really impress upon the students the value of

30:05.285 --> 30:06.806
narrative of storytelling.

30:07.407 --> 30:07.967
That's on the one.

30:07.987 --> 30:08.488
That's important.

30:08.508 --> 30:21.179
But then on number two, I wonder, in your work with children and with the impoverished people who perhaps can't read, adults, yet you still learn from the... you learn from these people, don't you, these children?

30:21.199 --> 30:28.045
By the way, I wrote some children's books, which you probably know of, and the reason I did that is because the children told me I should.

30:28.085 --> 30:33.250
The idea for the first book that I did, which was Dead End School,

30:33.500 --> 30:38.707
and which Norman Rockwell illustrated because he was close to Eric Erickson.

30:38.727 --> 30:45.577
They lived next door in Starkbridge, and I was working on that book, and Eric said, Norman should read that, and he should illustrate it.

30:45.637 --> 30:50.163
I said, Eric, I don't even know the person you called Norman.

30:50.523 --> 30:51.745
The next thing I knew...

30:52.045 --> 30:55.230
I got a letter from, quote, Norman.

30:55.671 --> 31:02.842
But I took the main... I was working on this book about what happens to children in ghetto life.

31:03.223 --> 31:07.910
In a city, you are having a rough time and going to school.

31:09.733 --> 31:14.340
And in this case, being bust in Boston, not to mention what I'd seen in the South.

31:16.362 --> 31:26.028
And one of the children said to me, why don't you tell people what you're asking us to tell you.

31:26.048 --> 31:29.477
I looked at her.

31:30.132 --> 31:31.995
I said, well, how could I do that?

31:32.075 --> 31:35.540
She said, well, you're always getting me to tell you what's going on.

31:35.680 --> 31:39.105
And, of course, I had the tape, of course.

31:39.125 --> 31:42.230
You want to know what I did with it and who listened to it?

31:42.570 --> 31:45.254
If anyone else did, did my wife listen to it?

31:45.334 --> 31:45.715
Yes.

31:46.195 --> 31:50.462
I mean, she was being, in her own way, a shrewd investigative reporter.

31:50.942 --> 31:52.885
About how old would you say this traveler?

31:52.905 --> 31:55.829
She was nine years old.

31:55.909 --> 31:57.692
She was an elementary school guest.

31:58.330 --> 32:18.550
I sat down and tried to pay attention to her, which is how I started writing stories about children, for children, based on experiences I've had with children, prompted in this case by a child to connect in a way my writing life about children

32:18.952 --> 32:27.242
to a storytelling mode for children, which is, she didn't put it the way I just did, but she got the point across.

32:27.262 --> 32:34.470
She certainly occasioned the writing of this, I mean, you took affirmative action and direct action.

32:34.490 --> 32:47.946
You sat down and you decided this moved you powerfully enough to... Well, she, you know, several of the kids, first of all, the stories and the involvement with them, but there, at times, you know,

32:48.179 --> 32:56.652
they spoke with me and to me, but they, I felt at times they were speaking for the world.

32:56.972 --> 33:01.078
Remember, I was an older white man who was a doctor.

33:01.138 --> 33:11.554
They knew that I was a person of some means and privilege and background, and for them the opportunity to sit with this guy who

33:12.108 --> 33:18.015
came for some fancy college and, you know, had this background was an opportunity.

33:18.576 --> 33:22.521
But I didn't appreciate that the way they did.

33:22.541 --> 33:36.838
I'm embarrassed even to convey that because I felt that I was learning from them, but they felt in a way that there was a responsibility for me to take what I had learned and to offer it to others.

33:37.058 --> 33:38.740
They didn't put it the way I'm putting it.

33:38.990 --> 33:40.252
But they put it that way.

33:40.312 --> 33:40.792
They knew.

33:40.832 --> 33:42.455
Certainly the way you understood it.

33:42.715 --> 33:44.357
It's clearly the way you understood it.

33:44.477 --> 33:45.939
Yeah, that's right.

33:45.959 --> 33:53.089
But they, you know, I remember the first kid I worked with there, Ruby Bridges, who's, you know, figures and all.

33:53.229 --> 33:56.654
And I worked with a little girl who went through a mob.

33:57.695 --> 34:02.922
And I observed on my way to a medical meeting in New Orleans in 1960,

34:03.374 --> 34:14.408
But I remember her telling me at one point that she hoped that I would let it, she put it that way too, she said, I hope you let some other people know what's going on here.

34:14.428 --> 34:18.053
So I said, well, Ruby, that's my job, ultimately.

34:19.014 --> 34:24.462
That's a story too, you know, the accident, because I never went south to do this work.

34:25.082 --> 34:28.607
I was drafted into the Air Force and put in an Air Force base.

34:29.188 --> 34:29.348
Exactly.

34:29.902 --> 34:32.927
I think you'd say, you can summarize my whole damn life.

34:33.708 --> 34:37.253
It's a series of accidents and incidents.

34:37.914 --> 34:39.216
Coincidental things.

34:39.256 --> 34:40.017
That's right.

34:40.057 --> 34:49.992
That somehow... Now, Erickson did say to me, Erick Erickson once said to me, he said, listen, Bob, I'm listening to you telling me about all these accidents.

34:50.273 --> 34:52.636
He said, but you know, I'll never forget.

34:52.656 --> 34:55.240
He said, you know, it does take two to tango.

34:55.260 --> 34:56.081
And I looked at it.

34:56.382 --> 34:58.525
He said, some of us...

34:58.876 --> 35:03.803
are only looking for these accidents, and some of us don't pay any attention to them.

35:03.823 --> 35:13.056
And if you're going to pay attention to them, you at least ought to give yourself a little bit of a break and say that you were ready to respond to those accidents.

35:13.076 --> 35:15.439
I said, all right, Eric, do you want to say that?

35:15.459 --> 35:18.743
I responded to them, but I didn't seek them out.

35:19.044 --> 35:21.788
They popped right in front of me, and he said, luck.

35:22.428 --> 35:26.094
Luck is important in life, which George Eliot tells us.

35:26.574 --> 35:27.195
Chance.

35:27.867 --> 35:30.070
Luck, chance, circumstance.

35:31.512 --> 35:31.712
Fantastic.

35:31.732 --> 35:35.557
She says that, I think, in Middlemarch.

35:35.918 --> 35:38.401
Chance, luck, circumstance.

35:38.421 --> 35:40.784
The James Agee professor.

35:41.125 --> 35:41.425
What?

35:41.465 --> 35:45.230
You had been the Agee professor.

35:45.311 --> 35:46.993
How appropriate is that?

35:47.013 --> 35:49.536
I mean, is this something that you selected for yourself?

35:49.756 --> 35:56.085
That's a Harvard story, because, you know, they felt that I should have

35:56.943 --> 35:59.506
a professorship.

36:00.206 --> 36:06.833
Then they thought that I should have a named professorship in the usual ways, through departments or through a philanthropist.

36:08.254 --> 36:18.685
And they finally decided thatâ€”they asked me, who would you want this professorship to be named after?

36:18.705 --> 36:21.988
This was with Neil Rudenstein, who was president.

36:22.087 --> 36:28.417
And I said, well, I think William Collins Williams, after all, I studied him when I was a student here.

36:28.477 --> 36:31.362
And this is the whole story of my working life.

36:31.763 --> 36:36.050
It's based on the kind of home visiting work that he did.

36:36.070 --> 36:38.293
He didn't only sit in an office.

36:38.313 --> 36:43.622
He went out there into those communities, up and down those tenement house stairs to visit families.

36:44.632 --> 36:47.755
President Rubenstein smiled and nodded.

36:47.795 --> 36:49.817
He said, I have to talk this over.

36:51.499 --> 36:52.820
Then he called me in again.

36:52.880 --> 36:59.868
He said, Bob, we can't name a professorship after Dr. Williams.

37:00.328 --> 37:00.428
What?

37:00.488 --> 37:02.350
He had no connection with Harvard.

37:03.511 --> 37:07.155
The money's going to come out of the Harvard funds.

37:07.195 --> 37:11.179
He said, if there were an endowed professorship for philanthropists,

37:11.513 --> 37:18.366
He said, even then, there might be a problem, given the way professorships are named.

37:18.446 --> 37:23.716
It ain't have to be endowing family, or a department goes through a routine.

37:24.498 --> 37:28.385
And you have to justify this in terms of the intellectuals.

37:28.465 --> 37:29.367
Art is an F.O.

37:29.387 --> 37:31.150
Matheson theorist, which there must be.

37:31.170 --> 37:32.172
I'm sure there must be.

37:32.152 --> 37:34.134
I don't know whether there is a Matheson.

37:34.174 --> 37:35.115
But there could be.

37:35.155 --> 37:36.997
Yeah, because he was the head of the English department.

37:37.017 --> 37:39.219
Had you chosen him, that would have been a piece of cake, right?

37:39.259 --> 37:39.559
That's right.

37:39.579 --> 37:40.721
It would have been very easy.

37:40.741 --> 37:41.922
I'm sorry, I interrupted you.

37:42.002 --> 37:42.502
No, no, no.

37:42.522 --> 37:46.827
Well, look what happened to Matheson, which is probably why there isn't a Matheson chair.

37:46.887 --> 37:47.427
That's right.

37:48.548 --> 37:58.378
But anyway, the long and short of it is that we talked, and we talked, and he suggested, said, Bob, you start your course out with Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.

37:58.882 --> 38:02.592
a great admirer of James Agee, he went to Harvard.

38:02.612 --> 38:05.260
He's a graduate of Harvard.

38:05.280 --> 38:09.010
Actually, he and my father-in-law were in the same class at Harvard.

38:09.597 --> 38:13.924
And he said, well, let's call it the James Agee professorship.

38:14.344 --> 38:16.227
Then the issue came up of what?

38:16.989 --> 38:23.679
I would not have a professorship of psychology or sociology or the social sciences.

38:23.980 --> 38:27.024
He said, I'll never forget, like an Eric Erickson question.

38:27.065 --> 38:28.587
He said, well, what are you?

38:29.869 --> 38:34.356
What are you going to call yourself in this intellectual world?

38:35.163 --> 38:43.093
I said, I looked down, I said, I like the way William James used to talk about social ethics.

38:44.795 --> 38:45.676
He smiled.

38:45.856 --> 38:48.880
He said, oh my God.

38:49.120 --> 38:50.422
Another Harvard guy.

38:51.543 --> 38:52.024
I said.

38:52.264 --> 38:53.246
He was right up the street.

38:53.266 --> 38:58.112
He said, Bob, I had a nice 19th century appeal to him.

38:58.412 --> 39:03.178
I said, that's how it came about, James, social ethics.

39:03.614 --> 39:06.837
When you think of... I mean, let me wander.

39:06.857 --> 39:08.779
High grounds are no department.

39:09.801 --> 39:11.602
Which must have been unique in the university.

39:11.683 --> 39:12.964
Well, sort of, yeah.

39:14.045 --> 39:15.086
Wonderful, wonderful.

39:15.487 --> 39:22.074
When you think of Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, this was a book that really had no audience when it was written.

39:22.094 --> 39:22.634
No audience.

39:22.654 --> 39:23.415
I mean, it was banned.

39:24.216 --> 39:28.641
I mean, it wasn't banned, but published loose, said no way.

39:28.661 --> 39:32.845
I mean, I have a first of that, by the way, first edition of that.

39:33.348 --> 39:34.831
Oh, boy, 1939.

39:34.931 --> 39:38.158
The first, yeah, the one with that kind of red.

39:38.178 --> 39:40.643
I have everything by A.G., by the way.

39:40.763 --> 39:42.226
I should have brought them here.

39:42.246 --> 39:43.950
You know, one of my sons has A.G.s.

39:44.090 --> 39:45.513
I saw that, yeah.

39:45.533 --> 39:48.399
You're telling me good work.

39:48.419 --> 39:51.325
When you think I'm bringing up A.G., it's not my mistake.

39:51.405 --> 39:53.109
I have pictures of him in my study.

39:53.129 --> 39:54.732
I think you probably remember it.

39:55.420 --> 39:59.825
David, will it be possible to take a few pictures, by the way, of the study before we do that?

39:59.845 --> 40:01.186
No, I'll check, yeah.

40:01.386 --> 40:04.450
And do you mind if I shoot a couple pictures, by the way, as we speak?

40:04.470 --> 40:04.950
Not at all.

40:04.990 --> 40:20.247
Let me tell you something else about the Let Us Now Praise famous moonwalk.

40:20.598 --> 40:25.664
always began with that book, and it drove the students a little crazy, of course, initially.

40:26.124 --> 40:38.238
They didn't know what to do with him, with the writing, with the whole, with a lot of those jibes thrown, including the intellectual world, the whole chapter in education there.

40:38.979 --> 40:43.504
But I couldn't have done it without him.

40:43.604 --> 40:44.565
I couldn't have taught.

40:44.585 --> 40:47.748
He was like a spiritual... It had to be a spiritual one, sir.

40:48.029 --> 40:48.329
What?

40:48.349 --> 40:49.050
I interrupt you.

40:49.070 --> 40:50.031
A spiritual what?

40:50.399 --> 40:54.203
the whole spiritual flow of the book.

40:54.223 --> 40:55.725
It had to be that book by A.G.?

40:55.745 --> 40:58.128
You don't think you could have done it with Death and the Family?

40:58.208 --> 41:07.298
I could have, but there's something about that book that takes on documentary work and the whole predicament that we're in.

41:07.338 --> 41:18.550
Those of us who are torn between our privilege and our moral responsibilities and

41:18.968 --> 41:21.531
It's an extraordinary book.

41:21.731 --> 41:26.595
I have to tell you, this is what I was going to tell you.

41:26.776 --> 41:36.425
I got a package sent, brought to me by a Yale undergraduate in the 1960s.

41:39.969 --> 41:41.570
It was from Walker Evans.

41:43.172 --> 41:47.516
And in it were pictures of A.G.

41:47.556 --> 41:48.537
that he'd taken.

41:49.124 --> 42:06.068
And he sent me a note saying that he looked forward someday perhaps to meeting me, but he felt that I should have those pictures that he'd taken of age.

42:06.208 --> 42:07.770
About a month later he died.

42:10.273 --> 42:14.379
Walker Evans, photography as it is in the future.

42:14.399 --> 42:17.123
Photography is a passion of mine, and Walker

42:17.440 --> 42:20.864
Evans is in the pantheon, as far as I'm concerned.

42:20.885 --> 42:22.286
Well, there are those pictures.

42:24.189 --> 42:29.396
When you teach Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, are the pictures, are the photographs?

42:29.616 --> 42:31.098
Oh, I show them to the students.

42:31.138 --> 42:32.540
So they're part of the text.

42:32.620 --> 42:33.541
Oh, very much so.

42:33.581 --> 42:35.243
Well, you know, double text.

42:35.263 --> 42:36.185
Pictures and words.

42:36.225 --> 42:36.966
Exactly.

42:38.408 --> 42:41.351
So maybe you could give me a little riff on that, if you don't mind.

42:41.391 --> 42:43.694
That whole conceptual thing.

42:43.714 --> 42:46.418
Why it's so important for you to combine the images

42:46.853 --> 42:54.263
Because that's what we are, the creature of words and images.

42:55.064 --> 43:02.033
Remember, when we dream at night, pictures cross our minds.

43:02.654 --> 43:08.001
When we wake up, we use words to convey what those pictures

43:08.960 --> 43:19.394
as they were seen by us and enacted by us in our dreams, mean, and we tell a story, which is our report about what we dreamed.

43:19.414 --> 43:31.070
So we are the creature who is constantly picturing things to ourselves at night and during the daytime when we have what are called daydreams.

43:31.991 --> 43:38.460
Then we use language to narrate, to tell us, to talk about those pictures.

43:39.335 --> 43:54.219
And in fact, Eric Erickson, who was an artist before he became a psychoanalyst and a writer, once said to me, he said, I will always say to my patients, what did you see last night?

43:55.361 --> 43:58.405
And he said that would get everything going.

43:58.425 --> 44:02.812
And I had those words in my mind when I thought of double take.

44:03.233 --> 44:04.515
Double take.

44:05.076 --> 44:05.697
Words.

44:06.031 --> 44:07.112
Pictures.

44:07.132 --> 44:08.754
And it's double capital T, too.

44:08.794 --> 44:12.479
I mean, so you really do, you emphasize the two words.

44:12.499 --> 44:13.179
That's right.

44:13.380 --> 44:14.140
That's right.

44:14.161 --> 44:14.881
It's not one word.

44:14.941 --> 44:15.562
That's right.

44:15.582 --> 44:16.383
It could be one word.

44:16.403 --> 44:17.825
It's a double take.

44:19.447 --> 44:22.971
And it's words, and I remember Eric saying that.

44:23.431 --> 44:26.455
What did you see last night?

44:27.116 --> 44:31.701
What did you see that you're trying to tell me about?

44:32.373 --> 44:34.816
And I would do, I've done this with my patients.

44:34.836 --> 44:36.358
I'm short to say, have you done the same thing?

44:36.378 --> 44:37.799
I've done this with my patients.

44:37.819 --> 44:43.045
I often say, well, last night, and I'll say, well, they'll say, well, I had a dream.

44:43.105 --> 44:46.129
And I'll say to them, would you tell me what you saw?

44:46.169 --> 44:48.371
And it doesn't happen.

44:48.431 --> 44:49.593
I don't say in the dream.

44:49.673 --> 44:51.875
I'll say, would you tell me what you saw?

44:51.976 --> 44:53.698
And they immediately know to pick up on it.

44:54.078 --> 44:56.881
And you mindfully do not use the word dream.

44:57.101 --> 44:57.642
That's right.

44:58.643 --> 45:01.907
But they immediately pick up because they have told me they had a dream.

45:02.343 --> 45:07.190
And that's when I annotate what they said with a footmark.

45:07.290 --> 45:09.513
So why do you avoid using the word dream?

45:09.834 --> 45:10.835
I don't avoid it.

45:11.416 --> 45:12.377
They bring it up.

45:12.397 --> 45:12.838
Oh, I see.

45:12.938 --> 45:15.041
And then another point, I would use it.

45:15.281 --> 45:25.436
But what I'm trying to do is accentuate the visual side of the dreaming experience so that it doesn't get lost in a lot of talk.

45:25.977 --> 45:28.721
Not the talk doesn't do justice to a dream, too.

45:29.121 --> 45:31.084
The conveying through words.

45:31.351 --> 45:34.775
what was seen and remembered.

45:35.436 --> 45:39.281
But remember, dreaming is a visual experience.

45:39.321 --> 45:44.187
So let us know... Not that there aren't words that take place in the dream, you know.

45:44.307 --> 45:45.849
We talk in dreams, too.

45:45.909 --> 45:46.690
I think we do.

45:46.710 --> 45:49.194
I mean, who knows?

45:49.214 --> 45:49.694
Who knows?

45:50.535 --> 45:56.683
The neurobiologist will come up with some little segment of the brain, and they've got to tell you that this

45:56.883 --> 45:58.264
This segment.

45:58.925 --> 46:08.714
I've often wondered what language people who are fluent in many tongues, several tongues, you wonder what language they dream in.

46:09.154 --> 46:09.414
That's right.

46:09.434 --> 46:11.196
What language they think in.

46:11.216 --> 46:11.476
That's right.

46:11.496 --> 46:23.207
Because I'm strictly all English, but my daughter is getting a graduate degree at that point in Tufts and French, and she says she can really think in French at some point, because she spent a year at the store.

46:23.507 --> 46:25.489
What a gift that is, to be in your 20s.

46:25.722 --> 46:32.010
and to be able to begin thinking in another language, I think it's a similar kind of a thing.

46:32.290 --> 46:33.812
But it is seeing things, isn't it?

46:33.832 --> 46:35.675
It is dreaming and seeing.

46:36.256 --> 46:39.580
So when it's acting, it's talking, but it's seeing.

46:40.201 --> 46:42.784
And it's primarily a, it's like a movie.

46:43.605 --> 46:46.709
Dreaming is a movie with sound.

46:48.511 --> 46:49.493
It's not a still.

46:50.153 --> 46:51.695
It's not a still picture.

46:51.816 --> 46:53.217
It's a moving picture.

46:53.418 --> 46:55.240
And is it a story, do you think?

46:55.625 --> 46:56.567
Is it narrative?

46:57.188 --> 46:57.609
It is.

46:58.009 --> 46:58.330
It is.

46:58.350 --> 47:03.599
Dreams are stories told to us by ourselves, then remembered.

47:04.140 --> 47:12.475
And if we are fortunate, if we work at it, and as Floyd told us, you have to work at it because you have to keep it in mind, so to speak.

47:13.296 --> 47:15.280
Then you become the student.

47:15.921 --> 47:18.105
You become your own student.

47:18.558 --> 47:20.019
Do you do this yourself?

47:20.600 --> 47:21.020
I do.

47:21.040 --> 47:23.583
I have a dream in the morning.

47:23.643 --> 47:24.504
I try to remember.

47:24.724 --> 47:28.428
Sometimes even like a few words down, just make sure that I hold.

47:28.808 --> 47:30.850
I got this from Eric.

47:31.451 --> 47:33.172
And I got it from Anna Floyd, too.

47:33.252 --> 47:34.173
She used to tell me.

47:34.614 --> 47:45.744
She once said to me when I went down to see her in New Haven, when she was at the Yale Child Study Center, she said, well, she talked about Eric because she knew him.

47:45.784 --> 47:46.405
He had been Eric.

47:46.587 --> 47:48.489
an Alice Sand, to use a word.

47:48.890 --> 47:50.371
He'd worked with her as a patient.

47:51.573 --> 47:54.256
Then it was called an Alice Sand in Vienna.

47:54.856 --> 48:11.696
But she once said to me, she said, you know, Eric's life as an artist helped him to interpret dreams because dreams have such a strong visual side to them that Eric could always appreciate it.

48:12.376 --> 48:16.341
You wonder about someone like William Blake and, you know, his, what,

48:16.709 --> 48:18.735
the dreams that the staff must have had.

48:19.156 --> 48:29.605
He learns these languages strictly so he can illustrate Dante in the original language or he learns Hebrew so he can do the Bible and he learns

48:29.804 --> 48:43.984
It's interesting, though, that Anna Freud did admit to me one of the only times I've ever heard her, she must have been critical of her father, but she said that this is an aspect of dreaming that her father didn't pay much attention to, which was an understatement.

48:44.385 --> 48:47.930
He didn't, to my knowledge, pay really any attention to it.

48:47.950 --> 48:59.406
He was so busy in analyzing, in a way, and then conveying in words what that analysis meant in dream analysis.

49:00.010 --> 49:03.796
that he, I think, paid very little attention to the visuals.

49:04.176 --> 49:09.584
So would let us now praise famous men be a powerful work without the pictures?

49:10.005 --> 49:13.991
Or is this a synergistic kind of a work where one feeds out the other makes it?

49:14.011 --> 49:14.251
I think A.G.

49:14.271 --> 49:15.232
would say no.

49:15.693 --> 49:18.998
I think he felt that those pictures are

49:19.214 --> 49:23.300
absolutely an essential part of what that book is about.

49:23.380 --> 49:26.825
So I wonder what it was that prompted Moose to say, no way.

49:26.925 --> 49:29.289
Was it the pictures, or was it the text, or was it both?

49:29.509 --> 49:30.330
I think both.

49:30.350 --> 49:31.191
I think both.

49:31.211 --> 49:32.093
He said, no way.

49:32.193 --> 49:33.314
I think both.

49:33.775 --> 49:37.360
It's the combination that I think Moose felt was social dynamite.

49:37.460 --> 49:37.881
Really?

49:38.350 --> 49:54.775
and, you know, the words are dynamite enough, and then you get those words in that context with that language, then they're taken away from the FSA tradition and connected, let's face it, to a kind of verbal dynamite.

49:55.235 --> 50:02.907
But they help the verbal side become more dynamite-ridden.

50:03.511 --> 50:11.423
The Gloria Club in the 1940s had an exhibition called The 100 Most Influential Books in America Prior to 1800.

50:11.723 --> 50:20.036
And they included, you know, the Noah Webster Dictionary of the Language, the Sears Roebuck catalog, believe it or not, the Montgomery Ward.

50:20.616 --> 50:21.418
It's a book, I guess.

50:21.498 --> 50:22.439
It influenced people.

50:22.519 --> 50:28.388
But that aside, the agey book, would you regard that as an influential book

50:28.958 --> 50:32.386
That's not what happened to it initially.

50:32.406 --> 50:33.409
It went out of print.

50:33.429 --> 50:34.952
That's right.

50:35.634 --> 50:43.693
But nevertheless, had it founded and not been... Actually, at what point does this book

50:44.382 --> 50:47.466
I guess it's reprinted by Holton Mifflin in the 60s, right?

50:47.607 --> 50:50.991
Yeah, it was definitely reprinted then because I used it.

50:51.011 --> 50:51.432
That's right.

50:51.572 --> 50:54.576
But prior to that, do you think it's one of these underground coal trains?

50:54.596 --> 50:58.582
It was Holton Mifflin, I think, originally published in 39 or 40.

50:58.642 --> 51:00.445
And then it was basically went out of print.

51:00.465 --> 51:02.087
I think it just disappeared.

51:02.489 --> 51:06.634
And then Angie died in 54, was it, early?

51:06.714 --> 51:09.057
Yeah, maybe a little later than that.

51:09.097 --> 51:11.100
I don't know when Death in the Family came out.

51:11.200 --> 51:17.027
Yeah, 55, I think, just about then, on his way to the Cornell Medical Center.

51:17.047 --> 51:20.351
But I think this all came after his death.

51:20.491 --> 51:22.033
Warper Evans was alive.

51:23.555 --> 51:25.037
But Angie...

51:25.237 --> 51:33.084
Remember, God knew Jews during the Civil Rights era because I saw that book in Mississippi with college students.

51:33.104 --> 51:48.938
And I thought, what justice that is, that let us now praise famous men has returned to the South and is being held to by civil rights young people standing up to the state of Mississippi segregationist government.

51:49.378 --> 51:52.561
That's such an important book for this book that I'm writing.

51:52.681 --> 51:55.243
I'm just thinking, I'm trying to find books that have really

51:55.730 --> 51:56.952
had an impact.

51:56.972 --> 51:58.514
It is important.

51:58.534 --> 52:03.039
And when I think that you begin your course, this has pride of place.

52:03.059 --> 52:04.401
This is the one that you start with.

52:04.421 --> 52:05.503
I begin him with A.G.

52:05.543 --> 52:06.544
and then with Orwell.

52:06.584 --> 52:07.525
He's the second one.

52:07.926 --> 52:09.388
Rode to Wigan Pier.

52:10.349 --> 52:15.976
Then we move on to Dr. Williams, Tilly Olson, very important in her story.

52:16.016 --> 52:18.579
I interviewed her in San Francisco a few years back.

52:18.619 --> 52:19.881
Did you?

52:20.232 --> 52:22.275
I took a picture of her that I let her use.

52:22.315 --> 52:24.558
She liked it so much that she used it for her.

52:25.359 --> 52:26.721
Oh, she's a sweetie.

52:27.061 --> 52:28.603
I think she's still alive, isn't she?

52:28.623 --> 52:29.324
She's still out there, yeah.

52:29.344 --> 52:32.448
She moved out of her apartment and moved into September.

52:32.468 --> 52:33.850
She must be in her mid-80s.

52:33.870 --> 52:34.150
Yeah.

52:34.190 --> 52:36.654
Now, there's a woman who's totally self-educated.

52:36.994 --> 52:37.795
I know.

52:37.855 --> 52:39.858
Her education is the public library.

52:40.239 --> 52:41.380
The public library.

52:41.849 --> 52:43.476
I've corresponded with her.

52:43.496 --> 52:44.098
She's wonderful.

52:44.239 --> 52:45.122
She's wonderful.

52:45.464 --> 52:46.669
These are the heroes.

52:47.211 --> 52:47.793
Oh, yeah.

52:48.134 --> 52:49.460
Oh, I was dead before.

52:49.500 --> 52:51.488
You know, I had such a brief...

52:51.704 --> 52:55.371
You get Dr. Williams and Tilly Olsen and William Collins Williams.

52:56.814 --> 52:59.579
And Walker Percy, who was also in my talk.

52:59.880 --> 53:02.625
That's social dynamiting.

53:02.645 --> 53:05.010
So Tilly Olsen, who else?

53:05.330 --> 53:08.456
Well, Allison, Invisible Man.

53:08.476 --> 53:12.885
So for your critics who say you concentrate almost exclusively on

53:13.085 --> 53:14.626
White males.

53:15.527 --> 53:17.889
No, it's well, Troy Olson.

53:17.909 --> 53:23.294
You're proving them wrong here, that's what you're telling me.

53:23.314 --> 53:24.616
I saw that in the Globe piece.

53:24.656 --> 53:27.218
I said, what the heck is this guy talking about here?

53:27.558 --> 53:30.821
A few years ago, there was a profile of you on the Globe.

53:32.383 --> 53:36.306
Holly's profiles, whatever.

53:36.487 --> 53:38.408
You have the reading list, I think.

53:39.449 --> 53:40.010
I can get it.

53:40.070 --> 53:41.171
It must be online.

53:41.331 --> 53:42.332
I'm sure I can get it.

53:42.616 --> 53:46.480
The reading list would include, of course... I don't have it.

53:46.500 --> 53:47.521
...Invisible Man.

53:47.641 --> 53:48.642
I didn't get it to you.

53:48.983 --> 53:50.845
I didn't get zero and stuff.

53:51.025 --> 53:54.329
Invisible Man is very important.

53:57.272 --> 53:59.955
Oh, Zora Neale Hurston.

53:59.975 --> 54:01.556
Very much part of that course.

54:02.477 --> 54:03.739
Zora Neale Hurston.

54:04.199 --> 54:05.741
What does she bring to the discourse?

54:05.881 --> 54:11.627
Well, look, what she brings to the discourse is the South and a black

54:11.995 --> 54:15.301
woman trying to find her dignity.

54:16.924 --> 54:20.451
You know, this is quite a story.

54:21.192 --> 54:23.397
And another rebellious, overlooked.

54:23.878 --> 54:27.304
She had a rough time, as did Angie, as did Williams.

54:27.858 --> 54:31.803
And Killie Olsen wasn't exactly celebrated for a long while.

54:31.843 --> 54:33.986
Oh, Killie Olsen had a tough time.

54:34.106 --> 54:37.190
I mean, she's been... And he arrested her in Kansas City, I think.

54:37.210 --> 54:38.131
That's right.

54:38.832 --> 54:40.334
I should show you what's coming out.

54:40.514 --> 54:42.898
Well, you know the Bruce Springsteen book, don't you?

54:44.239 --> 54:44.820
No, I don't.

54:45.120 --> 54:47.243
You don't know that book I do in Bruce Springsteen?

54:47.343 --> 54:48.124
Oh, I do.

54:48.244 --> 54:48.865
I'm sorry.

54:48.885 --> 54:50.287
It's obviously coming out.

54:50.307 --> 54:50.728
Yes, of course.

54:50.748 --> 54:52.029
It's going to be a paperback.

54:52.049 --> 54:53.511
And who's publishing it?

54:54.873 --> 54:55.614
Random House.

54:55.734 --> 54:56.135
Oh, good.

54:56.515 --> 54:57.156
I'll get it.

54:59.482 --> 55:05.535
Actually, I think I have extra... This I think you'd be interested in.

55:05.555 --> 55:07.058
So what a case... Oh, yeah.

55:07.078 --> 55:09.222
Oh, this is good.

55:09.323 --> 55:09.784
Excellent.

55:09.804 --> 55:12.129
Let me see if the guy is still in my study.

55:12.209 --> 55:12.429
Okay.

55:12.449 --> 55:13.391
Let me just a second.

55:13.451 --> 55:13.852
Good.

55:13.872 --> 55:16.257
Thanks.

55:16.277 --> 55:17.119
Fine.

55:18.078 --> 55:22.364
Tell me why... By the way, I saw a review you wrote in the Los Angeles Times.

55:22.464 --> 55:25.769
It's about a novel.

55:26.531 --> 55:29.375
They ask me, you know, why not?

55:30.897 --> 55:33.401
I've done about four pieces for them this year.

55:33.441 --> 55:36.265
And I've done a couple of op-ed pieces as well.

55:36.365 --> 55:40.852
It's a good... Five Pulitzer Prizes they won last year.

55:42.574 --> 55:44.457
Four more than the New York Times.

55:44.909 --> 55:46.271
No, it's very well done.

55:46.531 --> 55:48.414
Yeah, I'm very happy to be writing for them.

55:49.014 --> 55:50.496
Yeah, I was reading, I said, I know.

55:50.617 --> 55:52.699
That's great.

55:52.719 --> 55:53.200
Thank you.

55:53.220 --> 55:53.641
Thank you.

55:54.642 --> 55:55.663
So, why Springfield?

55:55.683 --> 55:56.685
Can I call you Nick?

55:56.705 --> 55:58.107
I would be honored.

55:58.127 --> 55:58.747
Yes, please.

56:01.591 --> 56:03.053
Why Springfield?

56:03.073 --> 56:05.196
You know, you'll see the answer to that.

56:06.610 --> 56:08.253
That's a very good question.

56:08.673 --> 56:13.461
You'll see there mention of Donathia Lang, who also came from New Jersey.

56:13.902 --> 56:16.225
You'll see that, and the William Collins story.

56:16.526 --> 56:18.409
You'll see the whole story that we're talking about.

56:18.429 --> 56:19.831
Makes sense to me right now, of course.

56:19.851 --> 56:21.594
And how I connect him to William.

56:21.634 --> 56:23.276
Sure, Mr. New Jersey, yeah.

56:23.437 --> 56:26.561
Also, I should tell you, it's because of Walker Percy.

56:26.582 --> 56:27.523
That's the story.

56:28.585 --> 56:30.087
Walker before he dies.

56:33.442 --> 56:42.514
He was dying, and I was saying goodbye, but he said, Bob, you ought to pay attention to this Bruce Springsteen fella.

56:42.814 --> 56:43.235
Really?

56:43.715 --> 56:45.578
And I said, who is he?

56:46.179 --> 56:46.639
I mean it.

56:46.739 --> 56:47.420
I said that.

56:48.241 --> 56:51.505
He said, you should pay attention to him.

56:52.427 --> 57:00.377
I said, Walker, I think I know the name, but I... He said, listen to those songs.

57:00.644 --> 57:03.608
And then it was very interesting the way he put it to me.

57:03.628 --> 57:08.474
He said, see if you can get the words and read them.

57:08.494 --> 57:11.838
He knew that I wasn't going to, you know, I'm not on music.

57:12.238 --> 57:17.625
I go to the symphony, right to the symphony, or to listen to the Beethoven of Brahms.

57:17.645 --> 57:21.069
He knew it was a generational thing and a lot of other things.

57:22.430 --> 57:25.554
I wanted to show him what it is.

57:25.574 --> 57:27.256
I went and bought my sons.

57:28.678 --> 57:30.280
My God, what's happening to them?

57:30.952 --> 57:40.143
I said, who's this fool's friend?

57:40.163 --> 57:43.578
I said, Dad!

57:43.600 --> 59:20.205
[Mumbling.]

59:20.205 --> 59:23.821
I was interested in Flannery O'Connor.

59:27.487 --> 59:36.083
He mentions Flannery O'Connor.

59:36.620 --> 01:00:06.185
[Mumbling.]

01:00:06.185 --> 01:00:18.508
And then you talk about a wicker-pushy rotation, when he came into that lecture hall.

01:00:19.109 --> 01:00:21.173
They all recognized him right there.
