WEBVTT

00:02.191 --> 00:04.093
Say it again.

00:04.133 --> 00:05.495
That's one kind of thrill.

00:05.695 --> 00:10.161
I'd say going to the big sale and getting the big item is a great thrill.

00:11.222 --> 00:24.739
But the other sort of, you know, the other kind of triumphs that make you glow when you think about them are to find a treasure that nobody realized was a treasure before.

00:25.040 --> 00:25.680
The find.

00:26.001 --> 00:28.744
And I have these happen all the time.

00:29.785 --> 00:31.067
It's to get a treasure.

00:31.182 --> 00:33.466
Very rare item for almost nothing.

00:35.449 --> 00:42.720
And these, you know, I could go for a week and show you these things that give me such satisfaction.

00:43.902 --> 00:46.726
Of course, once in a while, you make a fool of yourself.

00:46.826 --> 00:48.209
You buy something.

00:48.449 --> 00:51.153
But I strongly believe that.

00:52.736 --> 00:54.859
You pay the law of averages a bit.

00:54.879 --> 00:58.725
Once in a while, I will pay what I know is a little too much for a buck.

00:59.330 --> 01:02.634
but it is counteracted by so many bargains.

01:03.675 --> 01:09.622
Once in a while, I make a mistake, I buy something I wish that I hadn't bought.

01:10.483 --> 01:21.315
But you do that because once in a while you don't have the chance to really check out the item before, and you use hunches through auction purchases or through catalogs.

01:22.116 --> 01:25.219
And by hunches, I would say, have about a

01:25.823 --> 01:29.888
90% batting average, so that other 10%, what the heck.

01:30.208 --> 01:38.377
And the fact of the matter is, as Warren Roberts said, and I think I use it in that piece in the Times, this stuff doesn't lose any value.

01:38.578 --> 01:42.862
You may pay a little more now, but this stuff's only appreciated.

01:43.163 --> 01:44.344
Oh, without any question.

01:44.404 --> 01:46.727
In the long run, you're more like 98%.

01:46.947 --> 01:51.012
Maybe what you overpay for now, you know.

01:51.032 --> 01:55.577
You know, if you would think... I'm going to just use this stuff.

01:55.928 --> 02:01.917
You know, very fine stock, wonderful shop that he ran.

02:03.159 --> 02:09.810
And Ken, at no time while he was in the trade, did you think of him as being inexpensive.

02:09.890 --> 02:21.328
He wasn't wildly overpriced in any way, but he had very nice copies at market price, say.

02:22.945 --> 02:31.636
You would just die if you could take Ken's catalog one now and buy them for five times what the prices were.

02:32.557 --> 02:39.786
In the period that we're talking about, the inflation in the prices is just phenomenal.

02:40.486 --> 02:44.211
And I constantly am finding things on the shelf.

02:44.231 --> 02:48.396
Well, I'll pay sometimes $500 for

02:48.967 --> 02:54.893
a book similar to one that I literally paid $15 for 15 or 20 years ago.

02:55.053 --> 02:57.656
Do you ever go flea marketing and stuff like that?

02:57.816 --> 02:59.017
Oh, yeah.

02:59.037 --> 03:01.379
Oh, constantly.

03:01.559 --> 03:04.202
What I do is I cultivate.

03:04.903 --> 03:08.887
I do that myself to some extent.

03:08.907 --> 03:17.235
But even more than that, because I do get along with the dealers and respect their

03:18.160 --> 03:23.731
their business needs, they like doing business with me.

03:23.871 --> 03:31.507
And I have dealers in a variety of parts of the country who are an extension of my eyes.

03:31.607 --> 03:34.092
And they're going to the flea markets.

03:34.112 --> 03:35.555
They're going to the small dealers.

03:36.136 --> 03:38.160
And if they get anything good,

03:38.731 --> 03:40.893
They always will call me first.

03:40.913 --> 03:42.075
Yeah, but you never know.

03:42.135 --> 03:46.179
There's always that Tamerlane among the agricultural.

03:46.660 --> 03:52.987
I haven't found Tamerlane, but I've found some great treasures.

03:53.908 --> 03:58.513
Mr. Clements, did you ever have a chance to enjoy this?

03:58.533 --> 03:59.394
Oh, yeah.

03:59.414 --> 04:02.157
He was alive for 11 years at the place.

04:03.098 --> 04:04.900
Did he come here often?

04:04.960 --> 04:09.765
He had a regular office, and he would, yes, he was frequently here.

04:10.665 --> 04:17.933
It isn't really a museum, but there are a few treasures here that add a wonderful ambiance.

04:17.973 --> 04:25.200
That is actually Benjamin West's painting of The Death of Wolfe.

04:25.340 --> 04:26.922
He did four of them.

04:26.982 --> 04:28.103
This is one of the four.

04:28.143 --> 04:30.645
Again, every one is slightly different.

04:30.665 --> 04:32.447
This is the largest copy.

04:33.338 --> 04:41.351
That chest is Sir Henry Clinton's uniform chest.

04:42.152 --> 04:52.309
When the Clinton papers were purchased, the papers were shipped to America, Anthony.

05:03.241 --> 05:11.474
Who among us cannot love maps like that?

05:11.494 --> 05:13.658
Aren't they wonderful?

05:14.519 --> 05:17.604
In terms of numbers, how many maps?

05:17.624 --> 05:19.868
Why don't you just run the numbers?

05:19.988 --> 05:28.422
Well, I believe we quote a figure of 30,000 maps.

05:28.739 --> 05:31.103
I don't know whether that was all.

05:31.224 --> 05:31.985
Well, that's fine.

05:32.005 --> 05:32.506
It's both fine.

05:32.526 --> 05:33.548
How about printed books?

05:34.089 --> 05:38.758
Printed books have a better idea.

05:38.778 --> 05:41.022
Hello.

05:41.042 --> 05:46.833
We have approximately 65,000 premium titles in the catalog.

05:48.817 --> 05:52.283
This collection is very,

05:53.242 --> 05:54.323
heavily catalogued.

05:54.404 --> 05:57.568
We don't have a big backlog of uncatalogued material.

05:58.429 --> 06:07.341
So scholars can really find out what we have, and we make a great point of serving scholars, both by mail and phone and here.

06:07.862 --> 06:09.484
You have no problems copying things?

06:09.925 --> 06:11.347
Unlike Texas, for instance?

06:12.388 --> 06:15.693
We freely copy anything that can be copied.

06:15.733 --> 06:20.079
Of course, any scholar that wanted to publish something has to write to us.

06:20.700 --> 06:21.561
But no, we

06:22.452 --> 06:29.463
We have a strong feeling of... These are manuscript collections.

06:30.805 --> 06:32.828
Oh, Louis Cass, who was sent here.

06:32.888 --> 06:39.278
Peter Force, you know, the book collector, who was a mayor of Washington.

06:39.298 --> 06:41.141
Peter Force, F-O-I-C.

06:41.201 --> 06:41.882
Now, what was he?

06:41.902 --> 06:43.184
A distinguished collector?

06:43.324 --> 06:48.252
He was a very... There's a thing called The Force's Trapped.

06:49.373 --> 06:50.535
He republished...

06:51.106 --> 06:53.368
and a thing called American Archives.

06:55.230 --> 06:57.613
Something I should look up, huh?

06:57.633 --> 07:02.177
Peter Forks is somebody that you'd like to know about.

07:02.197 --> 07:03.439
He was a collector.

07:04.580 --> 07:09.265
He was involved in reprinting the very scarce traps.

07:09.445 --> 07:19.155
The first traps are the 16th and 17th century traps on early American settlements and exploration.

07:20.131 --> 07:22.554
And they're very collectible.

07:22.654 --> 07:29.100
He was involved with Henry Stevens I, who started that great firm.

07:30.442 --> 07:32.744
So he's one of the pioneer Americanists.

07:34.566 --> 07:36.828
A contemporary of Brindley, you think?

07:37.129 --> 07:39.511
He was earlier, really, a little earlier.

07:39.832 --> 07:44.877
His period went from the 1820s, say, to the 40s.

07:45.337 --> 07:49.902
Nathaniel Green's papers, you know, that's quantity.

07:50.692 --> 08:02.305
I was at the Kansas Movie of New York Book Fair last Saturday.

08:03.046 --> 08:03.406
You went?

08:04.007 --> 08:05.048
Yes, I went there.

08:05.068 --> 08:05.829
Just for the book fair?

08:06.129 --> 08:11.555
Well, I went there to see a private manuscript collection in upstate New York.

08:12.496 --> 08:15.980
My manuscript curator and I went.

08:16.020 --> 08:18.943
And so this is just the sort of thing we... Oh, so you acquired.

08:19.362 --> 08:20.283
we brought in.

08:20.464 --> 08:23.828
This is a diary of a clergyman.

08:24.149 --> 08:25.831
This is a private purchase?

08:25.851 --> 08:28.094
No, this is from the paper.

08:28.114 --> 08:29.056
And what did you pay for that?

08:29.837 --> 08:30.117
All right.

08:30.337 --> 08:42.995
That was priced at $650.

08:43.476 --> 08:48.643
A couple of travel letters.

08:48.843 --> 08:50.324
I bought this.

08:51.806 --> 08:54.008
Supposedly it belonged to Barbara Fritchie.

08:54.088 --> 08:56.771
I think probably the signature is phony.

08:57.371 --> 09:00.034
But I really bought it because of the imprint.

09:00.054 --> 09:00.795
Harrisonburg.

09:01.175 --> 09:02.536
Harrisonburg, Virginia.

09:04.398 --> 09:06.420
These are on approval.

09:09.723 --> 09:16.690
This is a list of all the people admitted to the lunatic asylum in New Orleans in the 1840s.

09:17.429 --> 09:20.292
which may or may not be worth picking up.

09:20.752 --> 09:21.834
Sort of interesting.

09:22.534 --> 09:24.336
This is a book.

09:24.456 --> 09:28.901
We have fine Civil War stuff, thanks largely to the Mr. Shoes, I mentioned.

09:29.702 --> 09:37.310
And this is a New York regiment, but it lists all the people, their age, their height, their eyesight.

09:37.330 --> 09:39.752
This is very useful stuff.

09:39.772 --> 09:42.055
Yeah, I think the Louisville thing is pretty good.

09:43.336 --> 09:45.138
One day it will be useful to somebody.

09:45.458 --> 09:46.339
I agree with you.

09:46.623 --> 09:48.805
This is Schultz's collection.

09:49.326 --> 09:50.287
Fabulous.

09:50.307 --> 09:50.487
Fabulous.

09:50.567 --> 09:51.548
He gave everything.

09:51.568 --> 09:52.449
He gave all of this.

09:52.509 --> 09:55.311
That's James S-H-O-F-S.

09:55.412 --> 09:55.732
James S-H-O-F-S.

09:55.752 --> 09:57.433
S-C-H-O-F-S, but he really was it.

09:59.215 --> 10:01.237
He was superb.

10:02.098 --> 10:10.106
He did, in the last, after he went to Bloomingdale's, he became president of Bloomingdale's in 1944.

10:11.387 --> 10:16.512
Well, Bloomingdale's is right opposite

10:17.453 --> 10:20.037
Dave Kirshenbaum's Carnegie Bookshop.

10:20.057 --> 10:21.478
You know, Dave's one of my subjects.

10:21.939 --> 10:22.240
Good.

10:22.480 --> 10:24.102
Have you talked to him a lot?

10:24.202 --> 10:25.704
Three hours on tape, I've got him.

10:25.724 --> 10:26.966
Oh, I'm real pleased.

10:26.986 --> 10:29.249
You know, I was going to be able to tape him.

10:29.269 --> 10:29.630
I got it.

10:30.230 --> 10:33.315
I got any work before he died.

10:33.575 --> 10:35.257
I had him all set up.

10:35.277 --> 10:36.920
I was going to interview Dave.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.942
You know, I've known him for years.

10:40.464 --> 10:43.849
And it was when Jim died, and Jim was his best friend.

10:44.808 --> 10:46.530
Tell me what?

10:46.590 --> 10:47.632
Can you tell me something about Dave?

10:47.972 --> 10:49.394
Can you tell me something for the record?

10:49.414 --> 10:51.277
Oh, I can tell you lots about Dave.

10:51.497 --> 10:53.540
Oh, yeah, I can talk to you about Dave.

10:53.820 --> 10:54.521
Oh, I know Dave.

10:54.702 --> 10:57.586
I mean, can you tell, how do you judge him as a bookman?

10:58.307 --> 11:02.653
He claims to have attended the wholesale in 1912?

11:03.053 --> 11:03.894
Yes.

11:04.595 --> 11:09.542
I personally have every reason to think he did as a young kid.

11:09.562 --> 11:12.486
And I have attended every major sale in the last three years.

11:12.526 --> 11:13.327
He's at every one.

11:13.487 --> 11:14.148
Oh, of course.

11:14.168 --> 11:14.629
And bidding.

11:14.947 --> 11:15.768
Oh, exactly.

11:15.788 --> 11:18.810
At 97 years old, he's got his cattle in the air.

11:18.830 --> 11:25.216
Well, I can tell you, Dave is a kind of dealer that I hate to see die out.

11:25.236 --> 11:25.937
And it's happening.

11:26.117 --> 11:27.999
And there aren't many of them left.

11:28.079 --> 11:29.400
For one thing, he's a man.

11:30.081 --> 11:31.041
Oh, I could talk to you.

11:31.662 --> 11:33.163
I'm going to have to call you for some close.

11:33.203 --> 11:34.805
I could really talk to you about him.

11:34.845 --> 11:36.166
He's great.

11:36.967 --> 11:43.873
He's, you know, if you ask other dealers or other people, you ask the sort of volume club type people,

11:44.275 --> 11:55.971
I will tell you that Dave, it's jealousy.

11:55.991 --> 12:01.038
It's that Dave does not cultivate them, never has.

12:01.759 --> 12:09.490
Dave is an absolutely loyal person to his

12:11.073 --> 12:29.790
Customers mean he and this is not true of some people in the trade When Dave is in an auction he is representing you And he is not he doesn't play footsie with the trade as much as most dealers do some of us some some people

12:30.344 --> 12:37.694
I think that he may be a little too close to the auction houses, and that may just be a scurrilous kind of... Well, Dave is close to the auction houses.

12:38.295 --> 12:41.899
He's done tremendous favors for some of these.

12:42.140 --> 12:44.383
John Marion just thinks he's the greatest thing.

12:44.563 --> 12:47.527
Well, I know he is.

12:47.547 --> 12:51.492
In fact, it was John Marion, when I interviewed him, who said,

12:51.843 --> 12:54.105
You're missing out if you don't talk to Dave Christian.

12:54.265 --> 12:55.766
Oh, absolutely.

12:55.786 --> 12:57.388
And thankfully, we set it up.

12:57.448 --> 13:00.370
Well, you see, Dave has an oldie.

13:00.630 --> 13:06.335
Do you know the little book by, you know, the little thing on the book?

13:06.355 --> 13:08.477
The Book Dealers of New York, done in about 1922.

13:08.597 --> 13:16.924
It's by, oh, you've got to get it.

13:17.585 --> 13:19.586
I'll think of it.

13:19.687 --> 13:21.428
I'll find it before I leave.

13:21.931 --> 13:26.396
The BRU, I'm just not thinking of the man's name.

13:26.416 --> 13:27.878
It's an Italian name.

13:27.898 --> 13:30.842
He did this little thing on the trade in New York.

13:30.862 --> 13:31.543
No, no, no.

13:31.643 --> 13:37.090
In fact, this is 1921 or two.

13:37.911 --> 13:45.820
He records talking to, going into the Carnegie bookshop, and talking to Mr. Kirshenbaum.

13:45.840 --> 13:51.347
Now, he is really, I believe, talking to Dave's father, and

13:51.732 --> 14:01.784
You know, Dave doesn't say too much about his father, but this guy says his father was an officer in the White Russian Army.

14:02.926 --> 14:10.515
His father was apparently sort of in the, he would buy and sell anything.

14:10.535 --> 14:11.116
What's that?

14:11.216 --> 14:12.578
The word is black market.

14:13.879 --> 14:16.443
Dave grew up in New York.

14:16.463 --> 14:20.468
But the father gives his philosophy of business in this book.

14:20.488 --> 14:20.828
Yes.

14:21.365 --> 14:32.202
And the philosophy of business is you buy something for a certain price, you add, I've forgotten whether it's 10% or 20%, you sell it.

14:33.123 --> 14:34.465
That's all you do.

14:35.687 --> 14:39.814
Dave Kirshenbaum has followed that philosophy of business.

14:40.655 --> 14:46.444
From the first day he got in, he has no other philosophy in the business.

14:47.335 --> 14:53.163
And what he does, he therefore has never lost money on a book.

14:53.183 --> 15:01.235
And if he buys something that's worth $50,000 for $1,000, he sells it for $1,200.

15:01.455 --> 15:10.709
Back when he was active in the putting out manuscript catalogs, you couldn't get to him.

15:10.769 --> 15:11.850
There were so many calls.

15:11.870 --> 15:16.617
He was selling letters that were worth $500 for

15:17.035 --> 15:19.418
120 often.

15:19.598 --> 15:21.260
But he knows his business.

15:21.681 --> 15:35.659
Dave has personally has never collected anything at all, except he very sheepishly will tell you that he got Harry Truman to sign his memoirs when he was out there in Independence.

15:36.420 --> 15:38.723
But Dave doesn't collect.

15:39.103 --> 15:41.046
He's there to represent.

15:41.507 --> 15:44.190
And he's loyal

15:45.149 --> 15:49.716
To people that have been dead for 50 years, he will not betray a confidence.

15:49.736 --> 15:53.402
I can tell you that's absolutely true.

15:53.583 --> 15:56.848
He will not betray a confidence.

15:57.209 --> 16:06.263
The reason that other dealers get annoyed with that is because you get the little friction.

16:06.303 --> 16:10.330
Part of it is that his customers were so loyal to him.

16:10.867 --> 16:11.848
And they were jealous.

16:11.988 --> 16:14.571
And he handled my big customers.

16:14.591 --> 16:17.254
I mean, Bradley Martin came into his office three days a week.

16:17.555 --> 16:18.496
Bradley, yeah.

16:18.516 --> 16:20.138
He sat right where you're sitting right now.

16:20.738 --> 16:20.899
Oh.

16:20.919 --> 16:22.741
And I had my wife with me doing the synthesis.

16:22.761 --> 16:23.462
Oh, absolutely.

16:23.642 --> 16:25.484
And Bradley and they knew each other.

16:25.904 --> 16:36.857
So Dave, you see, when one of these people would die in 1970, I used to go and sit with Dave and Shoaff at the old shop there.

16:37.343 --> 16:41.108
sit around Saturday mornings, and then they had... He still has the shop.

16:41.128 --> 16:50.340
Yeah, but I mean the shop he was in for 50 years, right opposite Bloominguez, there's a great dresser in there.

16:50.360 --> 16:58.811
And you'd sit around in this sort of cavernous place, and the mail would come in.

16:58.991 --> 16:59.672
Somebody would bring it in.

17:01.036 --> 17:10.771
A widow of somebody that he had sold something to in 1938 would send back, in brown paper wrappers, manuscript letters.

17:12.113 --> 17:16.580
Dave would open it up and would show the lay there.

17:17.581 --> 17:25.373
Dave would sort of toss it across the table, and he'd say, that's the interest you have.

17:25.960 --> 17:28.282
He'd just sell it to us right there.

17:28.302 --> 17:31.605
Didn't matter if it was worth a fortune.

17:31.625 --> 17:32.966
He knew what he had in it.

17:33.247 --> 17:34.228
He knew what he paid.

17:36.269 --> 17:40.313
His customers knew how honestly he had treated them.

17:41.134 --> 17:52.084
And Dave also has a sense in the auction room equal to surpassing anyone of when to stop, when to move on.

17:52.144 --> 17:55.427
He's brilliant as a bidder.

17:56.015 --> 18:11.535
And so people like Bradley Martin, people like Dick Gimbel, some of these other people, they just knew with Dave there, they were going to get it at the cheapest price they could get it with the greatest expertise.

18:11.555 --> 18:14.999
Well, for Bradley's Audubon, he looked at one earlier.

18:15.059 --> 18:16.501
He said, Bradley, this is not for you.

18:17.122 --> 18:18.824
You want good condition.

18:18.844 --> 18:19.845
Oh, without any question.

18:20.180 --> 18:20.941
Exactly.

18:20.961 --> 18:21.682
Well, there he is.

18:21.702 --> 18:22.863
Fantastic.

18:22.903 --> 18:24.185
I'm glad that this came up.

18:24.245 --> 18:26.407
He's in a small world, isn't it, this book?

18:26.508 --> 18:28.810
Here are the Gage papers.

18:29.631 --> 18:35.558
These are the Pleasant papers, Lord Shelburne's papers, the Germaine papers.

18:37.941 --> 18:42.887
You know what Bernadette cared for?

18:43.027 --> 18:45.010
Very thoroughly catalogued.

18:45.030 --> 18:46.912
See, they don't have one large reading room.

18:46.932 --> 18:48.654
You have a number of smaller reading rooms.

18:48.674 --> 18:49.495
We have two reading rooms.

18:49.981 --> 18:57.591
And then, you know, this sort of spills over... Who's this old portrait out there?

18:57.611 --> 18:59.634
It looks like... Helen!

18:59.654 --> 19:02.198
It looks like Andrew Jackson in a way.

19:02.358 --> 19:03.960
It's Thomas King.

19:04.280 --> 19:05.422
We don't know who did it.

19:05.502 --> 19:07.525
For a while, it was thought to be trouble, but it is.

19:07.545 --> 19:10.008
Do you think it's a contemporary portrait?

19:10.028 --> 19:10.769
Yeah, I think so.

19:10.849 --> 19:16.957
It was in sort of a traveling circuits or something back in the 19th century.

19:17.338 --> 19:18.840
It was given to us.

19:19.613 --> 19:26.342
This painting, I don't know who it is, but I think it's one of a balanced family who were engravers from Philadelphia.

19:28.164 --> 19:30.407
Lincoln?

19:30.427 --> 19:32.410
My gosh.

19:33.211 --> 19:38.578
Just reference, but I'm... We're in the stacks here.

19:38.758 --> 19:43.605
British Army lists for British military history.

19:43.665 --> 19:45.467
And also for British politics.

19:45.487 --> 19:49.232
And here are...

19:49.752 --> 20:02.228
First commanding officer of the United States Army under Washington.

20:02.509 --> 20:05.012
Melville was a British cabinet official.

20:06.093 --> 20:09.337
Hi.

20:09.357 --> 20:13.202
Rob Cox, our manuscript curator.

20:13.583 --> 20:13.683
Hi.

20:13.943 --> 20:15.245
Nick Wiseman.

20:15.285 --> 20:17.548
Nice to meet you.

20:18.997 --> 20:33.302
You know, you get these calls all the time.

20:34.544 --> 20:39.773
The Declaration, of course, every single one of those give away things from

20:40.124 --> 20:41.966
Twenty-five cents things from independence.

20:42.146 --> 20:46.130
I bet you put your own theory in the one that went in June, though, huh?

20:47.792 --> 20:52.858
One thing I'm quite confident is the story with no way.

20:52.958 --> 20:53.258
No way.

20:53.418 --> 20:56.742
I mean, we all know what happened.

20:56.882 --> 21:05.431
This is 1815 to the present for our collection.

21:05.451 --> 21:07.093
The Clements is...

21:07.968 --> 21:17.803
These are over... This is my upcoming duplicate sale.

21:19.226 --> 21:27.158
Duplicate auction periodically whenever I get around so I can personally make sure the catalog is in good shape.

21:27.560 --> 21:28.221
Now, J.T.

21:28.281 --> 21:29.943
Brown just doubled their space.

21:30.003 --> 21:31.825
You guys can't do that.

21:31.965 --> 21:34.067
We got a double of space sometime, too.

21:34.107 --> 21:34.788
Where would you go?

21:35.188 --> 21:35.749
Down?

21:36.029 --> 21:36.970
Underground.

21:36.990 --> 21:38.232
Underground, under the front.

21:38.252 --> 21:40.254
I suppose like the law school did over there.

21:40.274 --> 21:40.434
Yeah.

21:40.975 --> 21:42.957
You know, one of the problems—oh, I'm sorry.

21:42.977 --> 21:47.402
One of the problems is that—I guess I'm like Howard.

21:48.023 --> 21:50.425
When I got a buck, I want to buy a book.

21:50.726 --> 21:54.169
I don't want to put up another building.

21:54.189 --> 21:54.590
Now, Howard who?

21:54.610 --> 21:55.130
Howard Beckham.

21:55.230 --> 21:57.293
Okay, I'm sorry.

21:57.433 --> 21:57.533
Okay.

21:58.897 --> 22:06.688
Little repair area, work, lighting, and conservation work.

22:06.708 --> 22:07.810
Excuse me.

22:07.830 --> 22:08.110
I'm sorry.

22:08.130 --> 22:11.555
Well, we're going to get you a couple of publications on the way towards the map.

22:11.575 --> 22:20.288
This is great, by the way.

22:24.634 --> 22:24.814
Yeah.

22:24.834 --> 22:25.495
Newspapers.

22:27.044 --> 22:30.269
Do you replicate a lot of AAS stuff, or is it this?

22:30.289 --> 22:30.790
You know what?

22:30.850 --> 22:35.777
When Clemens established this, he bought all the duplicate newspapers of the Antiquarian Society.

22:36.479 --> 22:39.383
Yes, in that case, of course, there's a lot of replication.

22:40.064 --> 22:46.033
But you know, a lot of libraries have gotten rid of the old newspapers, but the readers hate microfilms.

22:46.053 --> 22:46.895
I do, too.

22:46.995 --> 22:51.101
So they're used, and I'm not going to get rid of them.

22:51.121 --> 22:51.702
Good for you.

22:52.390 --> 22:53.492
Because I love them.

22:53.512 --> 22:58.099
Every time I think about them, I think about getting rid of them, I start to read them, and I get nuts.

23:02.206 --> 23:06.133
Okay, I want to find you a copy of Mr. Clement's biography.

23:06.513 --> 23:08.416
Get them pretty well covered.

23:09.398 --> 23:11.602
All right, look.

23:11.622 --> 23:14.306
I'm going to give you one of these.

23:14.326 --> 23:17.892
This is Mr. Clement's own book describing his library.

23:18.412 --> 23:19.293
Gee.

23:19.313 --> 23:21.054
And... I can't find this, you know, by the way.

23:21.094 --> 23:22.075
I've looked in libraries.

23:22.115 --> 23:22.856
This is a tough one.

23:22.876 --> 23:25.298
Look, there's one that's signed by Randolph Adams.

23:25.838 --> 23:26.639
It's presented.

23:26.679 --> 23:27.840
You can have this copy.

23:29.021 --> 23:30.062
And... Did you sign it, too?

23:30.702 --> 23:31.343
Uh, sure.

23:32.504 --> 23:38.449
And... And it was... He needed to get... Winship really sort of helped ghostwriting.

23:39.490 --> 23:40.350
Understood, isn't it?

23:40.430 --> 23:46.836
But, uh, then... I'll give you the dedication.

23:46.856 --> 23:47.076
Dedication?

23:47.096 --> 23:47.296
Oh, boy.

23:47.316 --> 23:48.317
One thing about the directors...

23:48.584 --> 23:54.352
I'd say at this library, the directors have always been active historical scholars as well.

23:55.433 --> 24:04.926
So combining your collecting with perhaps a little teaching and writing books is a full-time occupation.

24:08.711 --> 24:14.980
I think we've covered it a little.

24:15.314 --> 24:18.018
Do you get the Bloomsbury auction catalogs?

24:18.038 --> 24:19.340
No, I don't.

24:19.360 --> 24:22.725
They're equivalent to Swan in London.

24:22.745 --> 24:27.372
Well, one of these Irish country houses.

24:27.392 --> 24:30.597
You know, books that haven't been touched since 1810.

24:30.617 --> 24:32.860
Unbelievable bargains.

24:32.880 --> 24:43.836
This, one of these British magazines, and got not only a pristine set of the magazine, but then they had bound up the separate plates, kind of for salt.

24:45.385 --> 24:47.147
That's one of those kind of deals.

24:47.167 --> 24:48.809
What did you say when it was hopeless?

24:48.829 --> 24:49.409
What's hopeless?

24:49.429 --> 24:50.510
What do you mean, it's hopeless?

24:50.671 --> 24:53.634
You mean this place?

24:53.654 --> 24:55.596
Well, I didn't have my machine on when you said that.

24:55.616 --> 24:56.697
You said, ah, it's hopeless.

24:56.717 --> 24:58.779
What did you mean when you said that?

24:58.819 --> 25:03.564
This book, I like that.

25:03.585 --> 25:03.805
It's crazy.

25:03.825 --> 25:11.293
Seriously, I thought it was great and it was cool with it.

25:11.313 --> 25:14.116
You can't believe it's a tragedy.

25:14.236 --> 25:15.257
What do you call this room?

25:15.946 --> 25:18.589
Well, it's the Atlas story.

25:18.609 --> 25:19.370
Mm-hmm.

25:19.390 --> 25:20.971
But it's wonderful for us.

25:21.031 --> 25:26.337
We were able to give them the time to see.

25:26.357 --> 25:27.198
Here's the first Atlas.

25:27.218 --> 25:29.560
This is the Hall of May Atlas.

25:29.580 --> 25:29.961
Fourteen.

25:29.981 --> 25:30.962
Oh, we just pulled it up.

25:31.022 --> 25:31.302
May I?

25:32.243 --> 25:34.786
Fourteen, eighty, uh.

25:34.886 --> 25:36.647
Bramley-Martin works for a million and a half.

25:36.668 --> 25:37.168
You know that.

25:37.689 --> 25:37.849
Yeah.

25:38.109 --> 25:40.111
Well, this is as fine as Bramley's.

25:40.131 --> 25:42.313
I'm feeling I'm touching it right now.

25:42.373 --> 25:43.595
I'm touching it.

25:43.615 --> 25:44.335
Oh, this is.

25:44.356 --> 25:44.856
Oh, my God.

25:45.157 --> 25:47.239
Well, this is it.

25:47.299 --> 25:48.060
It's brand new.

25:48.080 --> 25:54.388
Let me find the, uh, here's the world map.

25:55.189 --> 25:56.230
Original coloring.

25:56.570 --> 25:57.892
Oh, yeah.

25:57.972 --> 26:04.399
Let me just get that again.

26:04.419 --> 26:07.323
Oh, this is probably the picture, you know?

26:09.625 --> 26:12.148
It's probably... And I just want to look at it.

26:13.730 --> 26:13.830
Okay.

26:14.350 --> 26:20.196
You know, we've got these cans.

26:20.977 --> 26:40.678
In 1923, he and the university bought the entire collection of a French, New Orleans-born French Confederate, I mean, New Orleans-born Confederate, who then moved to Paris.

26:41.384 --> 26:41.985
died there.

26:42.025 --> 26:45.991
His name was Henry Vigneault, V-I-G-N-A-U-D.

26:48.194 --> 26:51.619
Vigneault was a great collector on exploration.

26:51.679 --> 27:00.793
He was a scholar on Columbus, on Vespucci, and he had a collection of over 60,000 titles.

27:01.173 --> 27:01.434
Jeez.

27:02.034 --> 27:09.265
Clements and the university together bought the whole collection and included in one shot Clements got it.

27:10.088 --> 27:22.989
all of the key editions of Ptolemy, Mercator, Blau, and Ortelius, which we could barely afford for that.

27:23.871 --> 27:26.255
But the mine collection is just a bagel.

27:26.275 --> 27:27.156
This is just a small room.

27:27.216 --> 27:33.046
I would say this room is probably 15 by 15, if it's bad, you know, maybe 20 by 20.

27:33.066 --> 27:35.370
They're only the Library of Congress.

27:36.397 --> 27:56.981
the American Geographical Society, the Newberry, the Huntington, and, let's say, John Carter Brown have a fair percentage of what's here, and we have many that are unique, they have others that are unique, but it's in that league.

27:58.222 --> 28:04.750
We have a portal on chart that I got problems.

28:05.590 --> 28:24.654
This came from a French dealer, and it had been captured, I'm sure, by a British admiral in the 1740s, in perfect condition.

28:24.674 --> 28:28.138
And we bought this in honor of one of the chairman of our associates.

28:33.316 --> 28:35.279
This is very exciting for me.

28:35.299 --> 28:36.181
We're always out there.

28:37.944 --> 28:39.927
So they tell you, I've been collecting libraries.

28:39.947 --> 28:45.135
Don't forget that stuff.

28:45.816 --> 28:51.466
Now, let me get... You going to leave that door open?

28:51.646 --> 28:55.272
Yeah, it was, I'm sure.

28:55.412 --> 28:59.779
So is this door, John?

29:03.050 --> 29:08.757
Okay, it's closed.
