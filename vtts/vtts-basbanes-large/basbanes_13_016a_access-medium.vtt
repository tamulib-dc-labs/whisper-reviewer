00:02.765 --> 00:06.329
in 1970.

00:06.349 --> 00:17.239
His doctoral work was on the 18th century London book trade, and he has published extensively on this subject.

00:18.801 --> 00:32.755
Many of you knew Terry in Columbia, where he brought further than now, because the library was through there, by founding the Book Art Thread in 1971, and in

00:33.207 --> 00:38.275
founding the Rare Book School.

00:38.295 --> 00:51.975
He moved Book Arts Press and Rare Book School to the University of Virginia in 1992, where he accepted his appointment as university professor and honorary curator of special collections.

00:52.495 --> 01:05.392
dreams that I continue, that I refuse to accomplish, to attend the radical team someday.

01:05.933 --> 01:16.647
And particularly now that I've read it, students commented on it and called it an intellectual Hawaii.

01:19.428 --> 01:27.643
Well, Terry and the press and the school are enriching and inspiring the actors in Virginia now.

01:27.663 --> 01:31.830
And to enrich and inspire is what a great teacher does.

01:33.053 --> 01:42.229
And we all can attest, I think, tonight to that inspiration that goes beyond the classroom that we know will be with us for the rest of our lives.

01:42.462 --> 01:45.690
Uh, Terry, we asked you to speak to Tony.

01:45.710 --> 01:50.301
We're going on a principle that it takes a great teacher to know him.

01:50.321 --> 01:57.197
So it's a very great pleasure to introduce to you, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Terry Dellinger.

02:09.867 --> 02:17.077
Is it just like home?

02:17.097 --> 02:28.493
When we talk about a book, say for instance, Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre, we generally mean one but not both of two quite different things.

02:28.513 --> 02:33.580
We may be talking about the now-woke as an intellectual construct.

02:35.568 --> 02:45.333
A very particular assemblage of words and sentences forming the text of Bronte's book was made manifest through any one of a great number of copies.

02:46.736 --> 02:51.889
On the other hand, we may be talking about a particular copy of Jane Eyre.

02:56.358 --> 02:59.481
as a single, unique, physical object.

03:00.102 --> 03:15.838
We may, for example, be talking about a particular one of the several battered copies of Jane Eyre in the Book Arts Press collection back in Charlottesville of the well-known 1943 Random House edition with Woodard Graves' illustration of Spicer's eigenfathers.

03:17.079 --> 03:24.407
Or we may be talking about a particular copy of the second classic mass-market paperback edition of Jane Eyre, available

03:24.657 --> 03:34.171
sale at Baldwin's Book Barn in Westchester, Pennsylvania, but available for sale no longer because I bought it last weekend.

03:34.311 --> 03:48.252
Specifically, a copy of the 40th printing of the Signum Classic Edition of Jane Eyre, the copy about to have a booker expressed book plate put in it on its inside cover, the copy now sitting on the opposing stone,

03:48.468 --> 04:03.110
in the Press Room, in Alderman Library, in the University of Virginia, in Charlotte School, Virginia, 2903, United States of America, Western Hemisphere, or Polar Center.

04:03.410 --> 04:08.518
A unique, single physical object in our universe.

04:10.169 --> 04:31.131
When we use one or the other of these two quite different meanings of the word book, we almost always do it without feeling the need for further descriptive explanation, confidence that the context will be clear whether we're talking about any copy of a particular title or a particular copy of any title.

04:32.191 --> 04:44.504
For those of us who kneel on frequent basis with books as physical objects, tend, I think, to forget that most people are concerned with books as intellectual constructs and not as physical objects.

04:45.445 --> 04:55.296
Most people think of paper simply and primarily and sensibly as a support for whatever text happens to be sitting upon its surface.

04:57.385 --> 04:59.068
Consider the following little story.

04:59.749 --> 05:07.945
Some years ago, a Canadian paper maker working at Massey College in Toronto, named Andrew Smith, produced a special book.

05:09.608 --> 05:15.218
He made sheets of paper by hand, and he bound up the folded sheets to make a blank book.

05:16.260 --> 05:20.608
He then cut out a Canadian $100 bill with small pieces.

05:21.533 --> 05:27.741
and he pasted the pieces of the $100 bill onto various leaves of the blank book.

05:29.763 --> 05:40.116
If I remember correctly, he called his completed work paper money, and he offered it for sale for a great deal more than $100.

05:41.838 --> 05:50.629
Many people who saw copies of paper money were outraged, thus no doubt fulfilling the intention of the maker.

05:50.913 --> 06:00.763
which was surely to focus attention on the difference between paper as intellectual construct and paper as physical logic.

06:00.783 --> 06:14.878
The difference between books like Jane Eyre as intellectual construct as opposed to physical artifacts is one that we're so used to that usually we never think about it, but consider a quite different situation in the art world.

06:15.584 --> 06:23.858
When we talk about Union Art Division's Mona Lisa, we're usually referring to a particular painting hanging in the Louvre in Paris.

06:24.679 --> 06:34.977
There's little likelihood that anyone is in conversation going to confuse the Paris painting with, say, the picture on the package of Mona Lisa chocolates.

06:35.564 --> 06:41.070
When I say that I've never seen the Mona Lisa, you know just what I mean.

06:41.090 --> 06:46.896
That I've never actually stood in front of a particular physical object at the Louvre.

06:46.916 --> 07:02.213
You assume I know what the Mona Lisa is and what it looks like because of the availability of copies of the original, not only on the cover of candy boxes, but also in the art books that I used in school and on picture postcards and so on.

07:02.497 --> 07:17.580
But whereas reproductions of the Mona Lisa may be more or less acceptable or convenient substitutes for the original painting, nobody, at least yet, pretends that they are satisfactory replacements with the original.

07:17.600 --> 07:28.977
Thus, while I can speak fairly easily about Jane Eyre in both an intellectual and an artifactual way, the book versus a particular copy of the book,

07:29.969 --> 07:39.598
are considerably more difficultly in doing so about the Mona Lisa, which, at least in many ways, is not an intellectual construct at all.

07:40.119 --> 07:44.643
It is simply and necessarily and inescapably an artifact.

07:46.845 --> 07:59.757
It may be that someday we will have easy access to surveys for the Mona Lisa that are so good that they will accommodate most of the needs primarily satisfied only by the original artifact,

08:00.445 --> 08:15.231
and the electronic version of the Mona Lisa, full-sized and so detailed, with colors so faithful, that we will not be able to recognize the difference between the original and its electronics area from, say, six feet away.

08:16.105 --> 08:21.249
But that day will presumably be a while on coming, although it will surely come.

08:21.269 --> 08:33.160
And meanwhile, the goal between the original one and only Mona Lisa in Paris and the currently accessible surrogates is a wide one.

08:33.180 --> 08:37.544
The Mona Lisa lives comfortably at the center of the world of fine arts.

08:38.865 --> 08:46.011
In the world of the book arts, the distinctions between artifact and intellectual construct can become a bit blurred

08:46.852 --> 08:52.841
But still, I hear you thinking, if one is serious, one must always have access to the original.

08:54.062 --> 09:02.935
You probably believe that statement, and so do I. But consider the difference between general librarians and rare book librarians.

09:03.896 --> 09:08.383
General librarians are concerned with intellectual constructs.

09:08.403 --> 09:12.188
Rare book librarians are concerned with physical objects.

09:12.208 --> 09:15.593
Rare book librarians are, relatively speaking, few in number.

09:15.944 --> 09:21.032
General librarians, at least by comparison, are very numerous.

09:21.052 --> 09:36.818
The library profession in this country, over the past century and more, has been dominated by persons concerned with closest intellectual constructs, professionals dedicated to making information available as broadly as possible to the largest number of persons possible.

09:38.140 --> 09:39.021
And good for them.

09:39.041 --> 09:42.627
A noble undertaking which, however, can go too far,

09:42.961 --> 09:47.807
As books are for use, they are going to continue to argue.

09:47.827 --> 10:02.145
If your copy gets used up in the process of being read, then get another one, or buy a reframe, or use a Microsoft copy, or make a prototype, or find a copy available in machine-readable form.

10:02.165 --> 10:11.297
General librarians are suspicious of all constraints on access to knowledge, including the constraints imposed by regular librarians.

10:11.598 --> 10:16.505
on the use of rare and fragile securities in their charge.

10:16.525 --> 10:24.956
And what is true of general librarians is even more true of most general readers, who almost always think in terms of intellectual constructs, not physical objects.

10:27.540 --> 10:38.955
And because this is so, because there are a great many readers and general librarians, and relatively few rare book librarians and persons otherwise interested in the book particular physical object,

10:39.796 --> 10:44.600
An important job of education faces over the rest of us.

10:45.101 --> 11:09.043
It becomes all those who are in constitutional arts or in books as physical objects from any point of view to join in the effort to help libraries identify physically interesting books in their perception and encourage them to retain such books as physical objects in their present condition without reminding them or putting their intellectual contents into a different physical format.

11:09.918 --> 11:33.833
It does seem to me that one could wait forward such developments to send as part of their book by Brains themselves to the importance of the physical nature of the materials in that care and to encourage them to learn as much as they can about type, paper, printing, illustrations, binding, and original distribution and later destinations of their books.

11:34.117 --> 11:41.337
so that they will be able to defend them against physical objects if necessary against their own supervisors.

11:41.357 --> 11:48.497
The more knowledgeable curious they are, the less believable they are.

11:48.764 --> 12:14.873
This is my justification for establishing Rare Book School at Columbia University in 1983, and for causing to be offered therein such courses as the physical bibliography of early printed books, or the history of paper making, or the history of typography, or the history of binding, or book illustration, and so on, and for moving Rare Book School to the University of Virginia in 1992.

12:16.405 --> 12:26.663
And I say to this audience that one of my inspirations in studying on various book arts programs, both at Columbia and at the University of Virginia, was Laurie John Crisola.

12:27.685 --> 12:36.460
Mrs. Young lived at 21 Claremont Avenue, behind Barnard College, and less than two blocks from the main gate of Columbia University.

12:36.480 --> 12:37.722
And so did I.

12:38.495 --> 12:41.945
The Youngs had a big apartment on an upper floor of 21 Claremont.

12:42.467 --> 12:50.952
I had a small, dark apartment on a lower floor of 21 Claremont.

12:51.674 --> 13:02.412
Carol Dermont used to say that my apartment was so dark that the only husk plant I could grow successfully was fungus.

13:02.432 --> 13:07.500
The dark apartment actually wanted to throw them on evidence, but it was the same guilty.

13:08.122 --> 13:13.210
And I used to see Mr. and Mrs. Young quite often in the elevator and the hallway.

13:13.679 --> 13:39.062
In the 1970s, I visited Mrs. Young on a number of occasions in her studio, located just behind Kay Coney on West Orange District, and talked with her, among many other matters, about her involvement over the years with various book arts programs at Columbia, some of them located in the space of the Post Office on 115th and Amsterdam.

13:40.612 --> 13:48.822
When I talked with her in the early 1970s, Mrs. Young was not trending towards Columbia University.

13:48.842 --> 14:02.718
The paper-making, book-finding, and psychology programs with which she had been involved in Columbia in the 40s and 50s had been swept away, beginning in the later 50s when Jacques Barza became provost at the university.

14:02.738 --> 14:05.742
This is not a crazy school, he said.

14:06.177 --> 14:12.388
and he abolished a distinguished collection of general studies-based courses in printing publishing.

14:12.790 --> 14:13.875
That's very interesting.

14:14.716 --> 14:28.935
The instructors of those courses, Mrs. Young informed me, with considerable satisfaction, managed to make off with a considerable amount of Columbia-owned paper-natees.

14:28.955 --> 14:36.966
And no, she told me, really, when I was setting up the Booker Express, she would not tell me where that clip and down was.

14:37.287 --> 14:40.992
And she never did.

14:41.012 --> 14:42.073
Let me add...

14:42.053 --> 14:46.221
parenthetically, that Mrs. Young could be an expert at grit.

14:46.301 --> 14:53.074
In her grit face, she reminds me of a story they tell at the Huntington Library.

14:54.577 --> 15:02.172
In San Marino, there's an oil painting at the Huntington, about Henry Huntington's former little wife, Arabella Huntington.

15:02.607 --> 15:10.620
hanging on a wall next to the elevator in an ante drum outside of one of the Huntington's 18th century picture galleries.

15:10.741 --> 15:18.293
In 1922, when Mrs. Huntington first saw this painting in her soul, she made the artist rework it.

15:18.313 --> 15:19.575
It was too flattering, she said.

15:20.497 --> 15:25.345
As repainted, Mrs. Huntington now looks pretty grim.

15:25.606 --> 15:28.851
So much so indeed that on one occasion,

15:29.202 --> 15:48.156
The visiting college class brushed it out of the elevator and into the ante-drill, and their instructor directed the class's attention to the painting of Arabella, saying, knowledgeably, she pointed to it, Mrs. Sitton says that magic music.

15:48.727 --> 16:05.429
These events at Columbia University, not only in the 40s and 50s, but also in the 80s and 90s, suggested that Innocence Young had good reason to be correct about Columbia, and to keep her master about the location they could make in the book like that.

16:05.470 --> 16:13.300
Though in fairness, I don't think you need to mourn the loss of much Bookart's press property as the result of the translation.

16:15.558 --> 16:21.567
Back to artifacts and intellectual constructs and the training of general liberal librarians.

16:21.947 --> 16:37.190
Granted that liberal librarians now or eventually gain a thorough understanding of and a proper respect for the books as physical objects, the next step, you might think, is to carry the message to the general librarians and supervise the liberal librarians.

16:38.152 --> 16:41.336
In many cases, this is not difficult to do.

16:41.356 --> 16:43.219
In a case, by way of illustration,

16:43.655 --> 16:57.032
Consider a copy of the first edition of a new deal's book by me, which is background in technique at one time or another, published in two volumes in 1946.

16:58.334 --> 17:08.447
A copy of the first edition was badly worn without its slipcase, then with the cover staining and the pages brought here, not a very good copy.

17:09.001 --> 17:18.808
But what if I told you that this particular copy of this particular book was once owned by Mrs. Young, and then she had carried it in her studio on 115 Street.

17:19.193 --> 17:27.121
and that the generation of students had consulted it and listened to Mr. Young's reservations about some of his contents.

17:27.141 --> 17:41.156
The talismanic qualities of this copy of Edith Biel's book, its artifactual values, now go up considerably for reasons which may resist logical analysis, but which are very real nonetheless.

17:42.117 --> 17:44.880
The book may be statistically in bad shape, but

17:45.502 --> 17:49.889
It must be conserved as an object if it is to be retained at all.

17:50.750 --> 17:55.978
A microform or photocopy of this copy of the appeal book has little purpose.

17:58.261 --> 18:10.119
In concerning ourselves with the artifactual aspects of books, we do not need to rely only on examples of which are based in pedagogical sentiment for their argument.

18:10.540 --> 18:11.982
Take life magazine.

18:13.042 --> 18:19.720
The history of commercial color photography in this country was written in the pages of Life magazine.

18:19.740 --> 18:20.442
It was immensely popular.

18:20.703 --> 18:26.258
Was there a barbershop for the beauty parlor in the 1950s that you can have copies to look at?

18:26.356 --> 18:48.280
Libraries too block and ground up copies, usually too many issues in one volume, however, with the result that most library runs of Light Magazine are now in rather bad shape, and their physical condition is not challenged by the fact that Light Magazine was printed on a heavy plate-coated paper from which the ink cracks off with lowly even lines.

18:49.019 --> 18:52.923
No matter, we may think, Black Magazine is available on microfilm.

18:53.985 --> 18:54.385
Or is it?

18:55.206 --> 18:59.090
The microfilm is available, and the person libraries in Manhattan have a copy.

19:00.051 --> 19:01.473
But the microfilm is in black and white.

19:02.394 --> 19:07.119
Color microfilm, like other kinds of colored film, is inherently unstable.

19:07.239 --> 19:09.161
Colors don't stick true.

19:09.181 --> 19:12.445
Microfilm vendors don't use it, and libraries don't buy it.

19:12.897 --> 19:23.352
If you wish to study the history of commercial color photography then, you'd better have access to a run of the original Life Magazine, at least until it appears electronically on the web.

19:24.293 --> 19:27.258
The black and white microfilm copies just won't do.

19:28.700 --> 19:37.993
As it happens, long runs of Life Magazine are becoming increasingly pricey optics, and it will cost you several thousand dollars to get a complete run.

19:38.446 --> 19:41.870
You see, your crazy Aunt Agnes is right.

19:42.911 --> 19:48.178
She says that you were something.

19:48.198 --> 19:49.580
Well, now they are.

19:49.600 --> 19:51.081
That's great.

19:51.202 --> 20:00.673
It's likely the case that many of us, especially but not exclusively our older ones, have permanent value only just as the logics.

20:00.991 --> 20:10.824
There's no need to read the 1943 printing of Jane Eyre as opposed to the 1975 printing or the 1997 printing.

20:11.125 --> 20:14.389
Any good edition of the book will do.

20:14.409 --> 20:22.981
As being the case, a copy of the 1943 printing of Jane Eyre is as disposable as last week's TV Guide.

20:24.403 --> 20:30.171
Unless a particular copy of the 1943 printing was annotated by Barry Moser,

20:30.590 --> 20:53.560
or there's a presentation description from chris eidenberg to lynn ward on flying or is rebound in full goatskin by lower young or has other sufficiently compelling artifactual qualities all of which is to say that by no means all or even many of the surviving copies of the 1943

20:53.708 --> 20:58.875
printing of Jane Eyre will, or even particularly, need to be preserved.

20:58.895 --> 21:12.714
And furthermore, it may be that not even the intellectual contents of the 1943 edition, with the exception of the illustrations, will be preserved, that they don't differ from the intellectual contents of earlier printings of the book.

21:13.696 --> 21:21.927
On the other hand, some copies of this printing are going to be valuable as physical objects, as artifacts, and are going to need to be looked after.

21:23.712 --> 21:30.600
We are all going to be living in interesting times with the next several decades as regards to the world and the physical book.

21:32.261 --> 21:42.453
This posting could be a good time to look ahead and in doing so to look back as well, for we've seen a great plumbering of our joint concerns over the past several decades.

21:43.474 --> 21:47.138
Of the great growth since the 1960s there can be no doubt.

21:47.489 --> 21:59.364
Think thus to the bibliography and newsletters that have appeared in the book arts since the founding of the Bibliography Newsletter in 1973, and we can take a date which speaks to my mom.

21:59.384 --> 22:01.330
And we can find that shortwave's matrix.

22:02.035 --> 22:09.625
the newsletter of the American Printing History Association, itself founded a year later in 1974, and its journal Printing History.

22:10.406 --> 22:29.832
The newsletters of the Guild of Book Workers and of the American Typecasting, of the American Tech Conference Fellowship, The Paper Conservator, Hand Papermaking, The Abbey Newsletter, The Auckland Paper Advocate, Conservation of Masters and Food, The New Book Finder, Publishing History, Rebels and Manuscripts Librarianship from RBMS,

22:29.812 --> 22:31.994
and, God help us, Biblio.

22:32.635 --> 22:33.956
The list goes on and on.

22:34.136 --> 22:43.165
Why this sharp increase of interest in book art in the 1970s, represented by such an outburst of journals?

22:44.626 --> 22:59.380
One reason may be that the book as a physical object began to become more visible in the late 1960s, as virography began to become common, and as non-print media became ever more important as a means of communication.

23:00.777 --> 23:06.223
and as later computer-generated machine-readable information sources began to emerge.

23:07.285 --> 23:21.942
Machine-readable information, for the most part, displayed or set forth on paper, to be sure, and often in book format, but disposable to use and to throw away because backed up by electronic originals.

23:22.597 --> 23:23.779
Yes, I know.

23:24.200 --> 23:29.551
People have been predicting the end of the codex book since McLuhan in a long time before.

23:30.112 --> 23:31.655
But still, look around you.

23:32.196 --> 23:37.246
You can buy in cheaply the CRT Bible or CRT Shakespeare.

23:37.266 --> 23:39.911
They're no longer laptop, they're palm.

23:40.533 --> 23:44.200
Surely, we're going to be renting or buying book chips

23:44.332 --> 23:55.029
to acknowledge the way we now grant provide video cassette tapes or otherwise download electronic information for use in our own personal reading and viewing devices.

23:57.173 --> 24:00.037
The speed at which all of this is happening is threatening.

24:01.700 --> 24:06.087
In the summer of 1980, I sat down in my first word processor.

24:07.315 --> 24:15.828
It was a DEC, a DEX machine, Digital Equipment Corporation, and it was the size of the boat slides.

24:15.848 --> 24:19.274
If you ate in 20 disks, it really worked well.

24:20.255 --> 24:34.538
If you get about 40 double pages, or if you get about 40 double-spaced pages with type script on each disk, it took two and a half minutes for the machine to move from one end of the diskette to the other.

24:35.108 --> 24:40.333
and we all thought we would perfectly want to change.

24:40.353 --> 24:43.556
A couple of years later, our debt was replaced by a debt maker.

24:44.357 --> 24:51.183
And then our dedicated word processors were replaced by IBM XTs and then by 386s.

24:51.203 --> 25:03.394
In the fall of 1989, I received a letter from Paul Mito from Venice, then still the astro-creator of Pinnacles and Binding, Morgan, to which he had dug his epony

25:04.505 --> 25:10.335
Printed in a type-quality font on a Hewlett-Packard laser jet printer, Time Throne.

25:11.698 --> 25:22.677
It was the first personal letter in 1989 that I had ever received that was set in type, as opposed to a typewriter basis like Courier or Prestige.

25:23.999 --> 25:26.023
And I was consumed with gelatin.

25:26.341 --> 25:31.366
That's wonderful.

25:31.386 --> 25:46.743
By the end of 1989, I had a way to just... I do introduce letters sometimes wrong, and did, or later, zap political, according to the most recently century school book.

25:46.823 --> 25:52.669
Boy, do I. The electronic or variety I've just given you has relevance

25:52.902 --> 26:00.252
In your electronic history, I can see some of the grown-ups in the audience rolling their eyes in the notion of 8-inch floppy disk.

26:01.293 --> 26:09.363
Many of you, too, have lurched your way from dedicated word processors to laptop powerbooks over the past, what, 15 years?

26:10.785 --> 26:12.768
Surely not much longer than that.

26:12.788 --> 26:20.698
I sat down at my DEC dedicated word processor for the first time in 1980, less than 17 years ago.

26:22.653 --> 26:28.239
Kodak's books are going to continue to be a part of our lives, and an important one.

26:28.259 --> 26:36.989
But books are already a lot more visible to most people than they used to be, and they're going to be a lot more still in the future.

26:37.669 --> 26:45.538
The fish don't see the water they swim in, but they certainly notice when the level in the tank begins to sink.

26:47.560 --> 26:53.228
Most of us have a considerable instinctive affection for the Codex book.

26:53.248 --> 27:13.956
One of my own speech party tricks in teaching descriptive bibliography in Virginia, and indeed in Columbia as well, is to take a late 19th or early 20th century book, usually a cloth-bound one with a pictorial cover, hold the book up and talk about its contents, design, and construction a bit, and then, without warning, rip it in half.

27:14.881 --> 27:24.640
and systematically tear it to shreds, as I accuse my horrified students of being overly sentimental about books as physical objects.

27:26.083 --> 27:32.215
Books, I say, as I head for the weight paper basket, with the shards of the book I have just destroyed, are for use.

27:34.321 --> 27:43.392
I think that our... I didn't pick the books I developed fairly carefully.

27:43.412 --> 27:56.528
I think that our sentimentality, of course, the physical book has been growing as the book becomes, slowly but surely, ever less necessary a part of our daily lives.

27:57.930 --> 27:59.612
A parallel case presents itself.

27:59.732 --> 28:03.737
As a society, we are far more sentimental about the force

28:04.173 --> 28:07.861
since it seems to be our major mode of transportation.

28:09.825 --> 28:12.590
We use horses now mostly for play, not for work.

28:14.053 --> 28:17.821
The same thing slowly but surely is happening with the physical look.

28:18.663 --> 28:22.992
It is becoming more an object of play than work.

28:24.338 --> 28:36.970
Our service formats are becoming more and more sophisticated, and soon, for example, the argument I used a moment ago in favor of preserving hard copies of Life magazine is no longer going to be valid.

28:37.631 --> 28:42.836
We will no longer need to rely on the black-and-white microfilm copies of Life magazine.

28:42.856 --> 28:51.004
Instead, we will have high resolution video copies in color, or on compact discs, or available on the World Wide Web.

28:50.984 --> 29:02.544
with easy access to any year or week in Life Magazine's long run, Phileadest, and copies will be available everywhere to prove.

29:02.564 --> 29:14.545
What's going to happen to our originals as our substitutional formats get better and better and convey a greater and greater amount of the information provided by the original physical object?

29:15.588 --> 29:24.017
But I replied, the presence of Life magazine in digitized form is not to leave us of the necessity of holding on to our hard copies.

29:24.037 --> 29:31.004
We still need the hard copies to study such obvious aspects of the original as the paper it was printed on.

29:31.024 --> 29:31.664
Hold the thought.

29:32.966 --> 29:42.616
James Berger once said that a dog's best friend is probably another dog.

29:42.636 --> 29:45.038
An old book's best friend is indifference.

29:45.878 --> 30:08.764
At the moment, books do best and last longest when they are kept closed on the shelf, uncatalogued, unread, unexhibited, unrebounded, unconserved, unmicrofilmed, unstopped, uninteresting, unopened, unused, unloved, unpunished.

30:09.098 --> 30:18.288
In most library contexts, books are staged for their own physical preservation only by accident.

30:18.308 --> 30:24.535
They are there, ready to be used, only as it happens, no one wants to use them.

30:24.555 --> 30:36.608
They say that books in the German language and the University of Chicago Library stats are used on average once every 40 years.

30:39.237 --> 30:45.443
From this curious position, such books have, at least until recently, been allowed to remain without question.

30:45.484 --> 30:52.831
Research libraries, after all, are largely out of books, but that in the moment, nobody wants to read.

30:52.851 --> 31:06.105
In the several decades since the end of World War II, certain libraries in this country have been almost uniformly enthusiastic about increasing rapidly in size, partly in order to support their research missions.

31:06.507 --> 31:15.655
partly from local or regional pride and partly because, left to their own devices, libraries tend to grow almost all by themselves anyway.

31:17.617 --> 31:23.602
American variable collections have grown along with the general research libraries of which they tend to be a part.

31:23.622 --> 31:28.866
Many of them, indeed, have grown more rapidly than their general counterparts.

31:28.886 --> 31:36.413
This has been a general situation since the Second World War, though I wonder how much longer it is going to last.

31:37.372 --> 31:44.300
No rare book library, public or private, can buy, or catalog, or house, or preserve everything.

31:44.320 --> 31:49.847
All libraries increasingly must rely on copies, whether by the film or otherwise.

31:49.867 --> 32:00.780
Physically reformatted versions of the originals held elsewhere, or physically reformatted copies of their own originals, whether they all have been destroyed in the process of formatting.

32:01.520 --> 32:10.388
or historically, formatting is being no longer cost-effective or otherwise necessary to retain the original form.

32:10.408 --> 32:21.157
Many of the search libraries are going to continue indefinitely to hang on to part of their holdings in their original formats, particularly their rare book holdings.

32:21.177 --> 32:25.661
But we're not going to be able to continue to preserve, in their original format, a great many old books.

32:26.081 --> 32:30.345
And we are going to become increasingly expert at the techniques of triage

32:31.017 --> 32:35.343
separating the seriously hurt from the walking wounded and leaving the morrow behind.

32:35.523 --> 32:46.818
The old books most likely to survive are those still in good condition, and in their original or at least contemporary bindings.

32:46.838 --> 32:57.092
Old books, even rebound in the Clancy Library Buckroom, with no intrinsic artistic or at least some sort of graphic appeal, are going to have a hard time with it.

32:57.342 --> 33:05.331
and many of them are going to end up in book art's press collections or in a sanitary landfill.

33:05.471 --> 33:13.440
Indeed, some of us are going to discover that a great part of our jobs is to lead the procession to adult.

33:13.460 --> 33:17.324
For us, it's quite a different way.

33:17.344 --> 33:25.493
A rare book and other special collections, public and private, are those which have include some significance or relevance as physical objects.

33:26.485 --> 33:30.749
There will also be continued pressure for rare book libraries to become museums of the book.

33:32.290 --> 33:41.378
A movement which, however, will cause increasing tensions between these rare book libraries and the larger institutions of which they are a part.

33:41.398 --> 33:49.906
Rare book libraries may become museums of the book, but are most academic libraries going to be willing to support the expenses of such museum operations?

33:51.287 --> 33:54.670
Or are most academic institutions as a whole?

33:55.612 --> 34:09.149
Returning to my earlier example, will research libraries in general be willing to maintain hard copies of Life magazine as our surrogates become more and more satisfactory alternatives to the reader for most purposes?

34:09.169 --> 34:20.843
Not for your purposes, perhaps, because you, for a soul, are an historian of colored photography, but for the purposes of the vast majority of Jeff readers.

34:22.375 --> 34:35.929
Institutions that decide to sell their artifacts and get out of the physical object business entirely, and many of them are going to do just that, and in the near future, you may be sure, will not do so merely from a desire to make money.

34:36.489 --> 34:39.552
They won't get that much for their real books, by and large.

34:40.553 --> 34:50.003
They will sell because they want to save money, to save housing costs, to save preservation costs, and most of all, to save staffing costs.

34:50.843 --> 35:08.002
It won't happen in the next decade, but in the next 50 years or so, I predict confidently we're going to see the wholesale transfer of old books out of American academic libraries at a scale that we have not seen anywhere since the decades immediately following the French Revolution.

35:10.304 --> 35:18.133
Well, as over the next 50 years, let me hand you back to the present and return to another reason why we live in interesting columns.

35:19.092 --> 35:39.598
In 1977, Robert D. Silver said publicly that if he had had to begin his scholarly career over again in the 1970s, he could never have written his books and articles because of the many and steadily increasing restrictions on the use of materials in the libraries he used over the past several decades.

35:40.580 --> 35:46.247
In this connection, it's worth remembering that members of the American African Society in Worcester,

35:46.227 --> 35:48.311
had keys to the eight A.S.

35:48.492 --> 35:55.987
buildings there until well within the tenure of the emeritus director, Lachis McCorris, who retired in 1992.

35:56.688 --> 36:02.380
And those members could enter the Antrarian Hall to work at any time of the day or night.

36:03.693 --> 36:18.782
Then there's Michael Linship, who says that if he had to begin work now, and Michael was a married child, who says that if he had to work now on Jacob Lange's great multivolum bibliography of

36:18.762 --> 36:29.616
American Authors, Visiography of American Literature, the first volume of which appeared in 1955, and he was an eternal, he could never do it.

36:30.878 --> 36:46.778
Copies of VAL books and their original bindings are rapidly disappearing to a considerable extent as the result of the current research library enthusiasm for rebinding, photocopying, microfilming, digitizing, and other kinds of physical reformatting.

36:47.686 --> 37:07.551
A great many of the titles in the language of the Bibliography of American Literature were originally published in the second half of the 19th century, and in the first three decades, the 20th of time, when the quality of materials used in bookmaking underwent a steady, progressive, deterioration as regards both progress and durability.

37:08.645 --> 37:15.132
Both fault is not entirely as a paper and cloth from which 19th and 30th century books are made.

37:15.892 --> 37:32.830
American libraries have been, at least until very recently, notoriously inhospitable physical environments for books, kept as they are in stacks that alternate between being too hot and too dry in the winter and too hot and too wet in the summer.

37:34.143 --> 37:42.052
One of my personal scholarly surprises was my first experience in using 17th and 18th century English books in English libraries.

37:42.632 --> 37:45.956
The paper in those books was white.

37:46.076 --> 37:50.320
I had been used to looking at Columbia and New York Public copies of the same books.

37:50.340 --> 37:51.582
This paper was yellow.

37:53.584 --> 38:01.112
And I remember the Oxford librarian, Michael Turner, who I remember to be shocked when he first saw ranges of English books in American libraries.

38:01.092 --> 38:05.584
He had thought that the older books in bodily were showing signs of wear.

38:06.206 --> 38:10.478
American copies of Hitler's books were at much worse shape than scope.

38:11.268 --> 38:18.060
Environmental conditions have been improving in a great many rural libraries around the country recently.

38:18.241 --> 38:29.260
Many of them are air-conditioned and humidity controlled, and some of them, like the Brotherhood Club, now even leave their air-conditioning on over the weekend.

38:29.280 --> 38:34.710
Rural libraries are learning what their colleagues in museums have known for a much longer time.

38:34.994 --> 38:53.718
that their responsibilities are essentially curatorial in nature, that they are primarily responsible for a collection of physical objects and not for the collection of intellectual constructs over which, by contrast, most general librarians reside and wish to survive.

38:53.738 --> 39:04.191
Increasingly, river librarians are so sensitive to the physical means of the frequently very fragile materials in their care that they take preservation as their primary mission.

39:04.171 --> 39:18.588
With the result of that, unsurprisingly, tensions arise between readers and rare book librarians as to whether or not the readers will be allowed to read a certain original text or only a physically reformatted copy of it.

39:19.810 --> 39:24.415
Readers in libraries want to read books, that's why they're called readers.

39:24.435 --> 39:26.938
What about bibliographers who have better things to do?

39:28.437 --> 39:48.715
Tensions also arise between bibliographers and rare book librarians as to whether or not the bibliographers will be allowed to study a certain original as a physical object because of curatorial fears that an overly close physical examination or manipulation of the item will significantly damage it.

39:49.515 --> 39:58.123
What happens, in short, when Michael Sadler shows up at the door of the rare book room and wants to make the detailed collation of your first edition of Jane Eyre,

39:58.897 --> 40:04.289
Or when Mr. Briquet shows up and wants to make a tracing of a watermark in one of your funerals.

40:05.130 --> 40:09.921
Or when Edwin Wolfe shows up and wants to make a tracing of one of the embossed leather bindings.

40:10.963 --> 40:18.880
Or when Stanley Morrison shows up and wants to look at one of the 17th-century European text testament books through his pocket microscope.

40:19.433 --> 40:27.585
Or when Charlton Hinman shows up and wants to put one of your 16th century play editions into his cover here.

40:27.605 --> 40:33.574
Or when I show up and want to roll my pocket photocopier across the first edition of your edition of Ivanhoe.

40:35.177 --> 40:40.024
Or when you show up wanting to make it a rubbing of a Dutch binding, blind stamp binding.

40:40.544 --> 40:48.638
They don't let you walk on their old Persian rubs at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, or let you drink out of their Renaissance wine glasses.

40:50.060 --> 40:59.235
That's great.

41:02.601 --> 41:06.788
Such fun.

41:06.768 --> 41:13.454
three kinds of renaissance wine glasses or letting you sit in your seat in your armchairs.

41:14.375 --> 41:35.034
Yet readers in rare bookrooms, and bibliographically sophisticated ones in particular, routinely expect to be able to handle the rare books and read them, or at least to finger them and calling them and to place objects on them and draw them in traits and photograph and photocopy and microfilm and destroy them.

41:35.054 --> 41:36.235
Not to be sure,

41:36.991 --> 41:51.175
Michael Sadler, Mr. Briquet, or Edwin Wolfe, or Stanley Morrison, or Charlton Hymna, all of whom may be presumed to be happily colliding and praising and rubbing and otherwise torturing books and physical objects in the happy hunting grounds.

41:52.898 --> 41:58.107
But still, those who are among the living are in the process of being hoist by our own guitarists.

41:58.127 --> 42:02.374
We are increasing the interest of the book as a physical object and rightly so.

42:02.354 --> 42:12.865
We segregate our rare books and prevent promiscuous access to them so that they will survive intact as accurate representations of their time.

42:12.885 --> 42:23.015
We want readers to take an interest in the books of physical objects in their paper type, illustrations, construction binding, in their manuscript annotations, and other signs of use.

42:23.876 --> 42:28.541
Unfortunately, the close studies of books of physical objects tends to damage the books.

42:29.762 --> 42:31.264
So where does this leave us?

42:31.548 --> 42:40.657
Over the shortfall, students of the Wilkis artifact are going to find that access to the outreach they want to study is going to become increasingly difficult.

42:41.959 --> 42:50.648
Over the long haul, they're going to find such access to be increasingly impossible because a great many of the books will by then become sanitary landfill.

42:52.029 --> 42:57.555
And because relatively few remaining ones, the books will have been allowed to remain.

42:57.856 --> 43:03.904
in their original physical formats because of their pristine condition or sentimental values.

43:04.044 --> 43:15.460
Icons will be so valuable that almost nobody will be allowed to look at them, let alone the collage or trace or row or otherwise common physical contact with them.

43:15.480 --> 43:17.543
Still, always not lost.

43:18.424 --> 43:24.893
Remember the analogy of the horse I used a few minutes ago, where the horse started out as means of transportation.

43:25.430 --> 43:33.558
but since the advent of the train and the car and the plane has become more an object of play than at work.

43:34.980 --> 43:40.225
I sold that very useful analogy from Santa Kirstenbaum, by the way.

43:40.245 --> 43:49.594
For the making of books, there is no end, and this seems likely to remain the case even as our electronic arrangements proliferate.

43:49.614 --> 43:53.378
The Codex book is going to have a long, happy Indian summer.

43:54.168 --> 44:05.323
The immediacy of words printed on paper will always remain, and at the moment at least, the excitement of the book as artifact, of the thing itself, continues.

44:05.343 --> 44:11.732
I had an interesting confirmation to this point last year when I was giving a lecture to Skidmore College in Saratoga.

44:12.834 --> 44:21.205
My subject was 19th century illustration processes, and I illustrated the lecture not with slides, but with copies.

44:22.518 --> 44:29.490
for everyone present, of actual examples of the processes I was talking about.

44:29.511 --> 44:36.723
I was told to expect about a hundred persons in my audience in Saratoga, and in fact, this over that number showed up.

44:36.743 --> 44:47.142
My hosts, as prudently, invited a large number of locals to a pre-latue difference, and then made sure that no one was allowed to escape between a certain intellectually.

44:47.122 --> 45:11.239
In preparation for a 100-person audience, I had made up a few more than 50 folders of blue coverstock and loaded each folder with 12 different examples, each in its own polyestered closure, of illustration processes common in the 19th century, including examples of woodcut, white-lined facsimile and interpreted wood engraving,

45:11.725 --> 45:22.221
talk manner and transfer lithography, steel engraving, process relief line and halftone, acronym photo reviewer, color type, and so on.

45:23.062 --> 45:31.515
Working two persons to a blue boulder, the audience could follow along from example to example as I presented my lecture.

45:31.535 --> 45:33.278
I can show you how the system works.

45:34.388 --> 45:46.386
They came down on cue, didn't they?

45:47.307 --> 45:52.735
Thank you.

45:53.812 --> 46:10.993
I brought 55 folks with me, and there are about 80 of you here, I think.

46:11.013 --> 46:16.680
So I should be enough folks to go around, and those of you who are here with someone will share with you.

46:19.394 --> 46:34.745
That's a digitized version, right?

46:34.765 --> 46:34.905
Mm-hmm.

46:35.442 --> 46:38.446
18, look at the date on it.

46:38.467 --> 46:40.369
It's yesterday, or today, isn't it?

46:40.389 --> 46:40.550
Wow.

46:40.570 --> 47:00.359
Each of the loop holders now handed out contains an original example of posed in a polyester enclosure, taking the book out very bad, what was named, you know, by the ditch of the water birds, a great program for the water station.

47:00.980 --> 47:04.285
Of the water bird volume of Thomas Hewitt's 1804, Mr. Bridge First,

47:04.535 --> 47:11.069
And each enclosure contains, sometimes on two separate leaves, and sometimes on both sides of the single leaf.

47:11.089 --> 47:22.915
There's these two original images, a Buick wood engraving of a water bird, and one of the enchanting little wood engravings, and yes, Buick used as tail pieces throughout the book.

47:24.413 --> 47:53.323
You can open and carefully handle the originals without interference.

47:53.303 --> 48:07.401
Looking at the illustration process, the polyester is like a kiss and a glass.

48:07.421 --> 48:19.497
Each polyester also contains a folded sheet, on which I have photocopied in the margins of four different different birds that we have to speak.

48:21.130 --> 48:31.077
So the finding contains an unfolded sheet of white paper on which I copied electronically both a big and small version of one of the four enlarges.

48:32.701 --> 48:34.887
I downloaded the big and small images

48:35.170 --> 48:38.594
Do you believe this?

48:39.415 --> 48:39.875
From the Buick website.

48:39.895 --> 48:39.975
Wow.

48:39.995 --> 48:40.396
That's amazing.

48:40.416 --> 48:46.122
It's aimed by the Edmonton Art Gallery in Canada that has the whole Buick office there.

48:46.142 --> 48:48.305
Amazing.

48:48.325 --> 48:48.485
Amazing.

48:48.505 --> 48:57.015
Now back to my Skidmore College lecture last year, I used Peer Richmond Buick Plus when I was in front of you as examples of white, white, woody bacon.

48:57.756 --> 49:01.600
And here I had an enormous piece of good luck.

49:02.558 --> 49:07.485
A considerable part of my audience was made up of Skidmore undergraduates.

49:08.006 --> 49:10.650
They had not identified the different formats.

49:10.670 --> 49:15.096
Their attendance had been secured through a simpler and even more effective device.

49:16.057 --> 49:25.390
They were taking an English department course on the 19th century British novel, and the instructors simply assigned my lecture to them as part of their coursework.

49:25.971 --> 49:27.874
They had to show up.

49:28.428 --> 49:38.126
The core novel in their course on the British novel, the book they kept coming back to throughout the semester and re-reading, was Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre.

49:39.829 --> 49:49.407
Now, those of you in my audience who are better read than I am, I'm sure it's both of you and have better memories, which I'm sure it's all of you who know where this discussion is heading.

49:50.028 --> 49:56.037
For the novel Jane Eyre opens on a rainy afternoon in November with a famous first sentence.

49:56.658 --> 49:59.924
There was no possibility of taking a walk that day.

50:00.845 --> 50:15.428
The young Jane Eyre, unfairly recommended yet once again by her nasty stepmother, steals off to an alcove window seat where she possesses herself of a volume, taking care that it should be once stored with pictures.

50:15.931 --> 50:22.203
The book she has chosen is by Buick's History of British Birds.

50:22.644 --> 50:30.300
And she tells us that, sitting cross-legged like a Turk on her window seat, she is mesmerized by Buick's little vignettes.

50:31.422 --> 50:36.572
It gave significance to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and fray,

50:38.341 --> 50:47.611
to the broken boat, stranded on a desolate coast, to the cold and ghastly moment, glancing through bars of the cloud, at a wreck just thinking.

50:47.771 --> 50:50.714
You've got copies of these, I guess, in front of you.

50:50.734 --> 51:05.850
I cannot tell if Jane Eyre can take this, what Senate haunted the quiet, solitary churchyard with its inscribed headstone, its gate, its two trees, its slow horizon, girdled by a broken wall and its new risen crescent.

51:06.083 --> 51:08.226
attesting the hour of even time.

51:09.327 --> 51:11.450
The fiend pinned down the thief's pack.

51:11.490 --> 51:13.392
Behind him I tapped over quickly.

51:13.412 --> 51:14.794
It was an object of terror.

51:16.436 --> 51:25.627
Each picture told a story, mysterious often to my other developed understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting.

51:25.647 --> 51:26.708
And so on.

51:27.042 --> 51:34.130
Members of my student audience have original examples of a vignette like these in their blue folders.

51:34.150 --> 51:41.799
And when I identified them, as deriving from Thomas Dewey's history of British birds, the response was electrifying.

51:42.700 --> 51:56.256
The students in the novel course all knew their Jane Gare very well, but apparently no one had thought to hunt down a copy of Hewitt and take a look at his wood engravings of birds or their accompanying vignettes.

51:56.590 --> 52:01.436
or to look for viewer images even out in the world right now.

52:01.456 --> 52:04.880
Did she actually identify the engineer?

52:04.900 --> 52:06.102
Did she actually identify the engineer?

52:06.122 --> 52:07.744
Did she actually identify the engineer?

52:07.764 --> 52:07.864
Yeah.

52:07.884 --> 52:14.973
But now the members of my Stipmar audience have the viewer bird and the viewer vignette in front of them.

52:15.053 --> 52:23.644
Turning again to the viewer vignettes in front of you, take a look at the unfolded sheet and take a look at the big and small version of the thief in his load.

52:23.962 --> 52:26.666
which is downloaded from the Edmonton World Wide Web page.

52:29.029 --> 52:35.177
The big version you can have is simply a blow-up of the small version, which is the size of the U.S.

52:35.217 --> 52:36.599
original.

52:36.619 --> 52:40.023
In this big version, the image-producing pixels are all too visible.

52:40.724 --> 52:49.716
Of course, they're still there in the smaller version, but harder to see, and therefore less subtracting to the viewer because of the reduced size.

52:50.540 --> 52:58.811
Neither the big nor the small versions of the thief and his loathe is as clear as the photocopy of the original wood engraving of the thief and his loathe.

52:59.192 --> 53:03.538
On the folded sheet, you have contained four at large vignettes.

53:03.558 --> 53:13.872
And I hope you will agree that none of these reproductions has the immediacy and impact of the original vignettes, one of which you also have in front of you.

53:13.892 --> 53:19.880
Indeed, one of you has the original of all of these examples in front of you.

53:19.900 --> 53:20.361
It's the immediate need

53:20.864 --> 53:23.869
of the original, the chapters are attended.

53:23.889 --> 53:26.293
No substitute for it is entirely accepted.

53:26.313 --> 53:26.813
That's it.

53:27.234 --> 53:27.575
That's a copy.

53:27.595 --> 53:33.264
And a large copy of the original has its uses for study purposes, but there is no substitute for the original.

53:34.866 --> 53:45.623
One wants both of them, perhaps, but finally, if one is serious about the other's foot engravings, if one is serious about anything, one must have access to the original.

53:45.822 --> 53:52.691
Okay, now I'm going to have these to call a fool.

53:52.711 --> 53:53.554
I'm going to pass it down.

53:55.002 --> 54:14.676
That's funny.

54:14.696 --> 54:16.680
In their Skidmore manifestation, these posters had, each had 12 personalities each and one of them.

54:16.700 --> 54:17.321
And there's something to think.

54:17.341 --> 54:19.204
Well, one paid for so much money, but second to get it to Skidmore, because it's still a lot.

54:20.062 --> 54:25.233
It was an exciting day because FedEx is lost again.

54:25.433 --> 54:29.221
Obviously, if FedEx didn't visit Skidmore, lost it.

54:29.522 --> 54:31.186
It was delivered.

54:31.226 --> 54:32.669
Everybody knew where it was in Skidmore.

54:34.753 --> 54:36.517
It was discovered during dinner.

54:36.717 --> 54:38.020
I had a lecture.

54:47.078 --> 54:49.783
So here we are again.

54:49.803 --> 55:06.774
Back to justification for what many of these people are living, and for rare book school, and for causing to be offered therein such courses as the physical bibliography of early minute books, and the history of paper making, and the history of typography, and the history of book illustration or book writing.

55:06.794 --> 55:11.162
The justification for rare book school, and for such things as rare book school,

55:11.429 --> 55:27.907
whether conducted in New York City, or Charlottesville, or Boston, or Bloomington, or Hanover, or University of Alabama, or Worcester, or in the small studio on the 15th Street.

55:27.927 --> 55:33.994
We need constantly to show books, real books, to the present generation, young and old, and to its successors.

55:34.598 --> 55:48.115
and to do what we can to ensure that the most comprehensive, or at least the most representative, collection of actual examples survive, so that we can continue to have grist for our bibliographical mills.

55:50.318 --> 55:54.443
We must not deprive the future of the past.

55:54.463 --> 55:58.328
Thank you very much.
