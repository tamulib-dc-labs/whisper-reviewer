00:03.203 --> 00:07.770
Okay, we're talking to Steve Wiley at the Massachusetts Historical Society, December 5th, 1989.

00:07.890 --> 00:09.953
Go ahead.

00:10.013 --> 00:13.999
I read a French book recently, and it was always fascinating.

00:14.059 --> 00:15.461
That's a wonderful book.

00:15.541 --> 00:16.803
Yeah, wonderful book.

00:16.823 --> 00:18.866
I haven't known about it before.

00:18.886 --> 00:21.109
I thought it was made at a table about a month ago.

00:21.229 --> 00:21.790
Did you really?

00:22.371 --> 00:22.911
In New York.

00:24.153 --> 00:25.455
That's the Oxford Press book.

00:25.715 --> 00:26.036
Yeah.

00:26.056 --> 00:26.517
Excellent.

00:26.637 --> 00:26.837
Excellent.

00:26.877 --> 00:30.983
Wonderful book, and how he stuck to it through the years.

00:32.212 --> 00:35.696
is the relationship of Kelsey Conrad, who was very interesting.

00:36.297 --> 00:37.098
She loved Conrad.

00:37.118 --> 00:37.298
Yeah.

00:37.899 --> 00:41.563
But they had a parting of the ways for a while, yeah.

00:41.624 --> 00:45.448
Well, however, I also have Quinn's auction channel on it.

00:45.468 --> 00:45.608
Mm-hmm.

00:46.309 --> 00:50.014
Well, things were so... The part of the piece was Conrad.

00:50.194 --> 00:51.736
Right, Conrad, yeah.

00:51.756 --> 00:56.362
So even though they may have had the parting, I think that he still recognized him.

00:56.382 --> 00:57.783
But anyway, I'm sure there's nothing.

00:57.863 --> 00:59.566
Well, who are the people you're going to check?

00:59.586 --> 01:00.767
Well, one of my chapters,

01:01.237 --> 01:16.272
My early chapters, when we start to focus on the American collectors, we'll have Jeremy Bell, and this will be one chapter for Isaiah Thomas, Jeremy Belknap, John Carter Brown, and Logan from Philly, I think.

01:16.712 --> 01:24.179
A little bit of Thomas Jefferson founding of those who were not founding, but Stockler, a great congress.

01:24.199 --> 01:30.265
So I'm really quite interested in Jeremy Belknap, and I think he could help me

01:30.616 --> 01:31.557
Give me some insights.

01:34.500 --> 01:39.084
Maybe Prince too, but certainly as a precursor, one who collected, but one who didn't preserve.

01:39.164 --> 01:40.646
Maybe there's something to be learned there.

01:41.546 --> 01:43.028
Well, Prince had a great collection.

01:43.048 --> 01:44.669
At one time, it was all here.

01:46.031 --> 01:47.372
Most of it was here in this building.

01:47.672 --> 01:49.374
Not this building, but in the Society.

01:49.414 --> 01:50.976
In the Society.

01:51.296 --> 01:52.197
Yeah.

01:52.217 --> 01:58.783
And actually, there were a number of copies of the Bay Sound Book in the library at that time.

02:00.400 --> 02:06.869
And we never, we never have owned a couple of them.

02:06.889 --> 02:15.562
And then later we pulled out of here, and I guess it was in the Old South for a while.

02:16.103 --> 02:16.684
Did they sell?

02:16.864 --> 02:19.848
All of us were out there, yeah.

02:19.888 --> 02:20.749
What are we talking?

02:20.769 --> 02:23.173
Are we still prior to the revolution now, or?

02:23.193 --> 02:24.595
No, that's afterwards.

02:25.616 --> 02:26.678
Afterwards, yeah, yeah.

02:27.147 --> 02:30.672
He was a man of that time, the library, which went on.

02:31.193 --> 02:38.144
Doesn't legend have it that he left a lot of stuff in the church and the British used it to light fires, or is that just an apocalypse?

02:38.164 --> 02:40.047
It might be, but I don't know.

02:40.107 --> 02:44.353
Well, things like that do happen.

02:44.373 --> 02:49.761
What do the soldiers think about just people?

02:49.781 --> 02:50.603
They might have done that.

02:50.683 --> 02:51.164
I don't know.

02:52.486 --> 02:55.450
But I was interested in the library because

02:56.881 --> 03:04.895
It seems so strange that this wonderful book, and there was a number of copies in the library, and the Society never wrote one.

03:06.157 --> 03:07.159
How was that?

03:07.179 --> 03:08.561
Well, they were not out and out.

03:08.601 --> 03:10.765
We were just storing them.

03:11.546 --> 03:13.189
So, did you make a pitch to get one?

03:13.470 --> 03:15.193
I don't know whether anyone did or not.

03:15.333 --> 03:15.994
I would have had.

03:16.074 --> 03:17.657
I would have made one.

03:18.228 --> 03:23.216
And maybe... I mean, Mark's got one out in... Yeah, they have one there, yeah.

03:23.296 --> 03:25.239
I think Isaiah Thomas got that, actually.

03:25.259 --> 03:26.220
He may well have.

03:26.521 --> 03:35.254
Of course, there aren't too many of them around, and the last one, of course, came up in the... Let's see, what was it?

03:35.274 --> 03:39.341
No, it was Harvard.

03:39.361 --> 03:40.402
Harvard has a copy.

03:40.723 --> 03:42.325
Yeah, Harvard does have a copy.

03:43.828 --> 03:46.632
They've got one down at Philadelphia or something, let's see if they have a copy.

03:48.687 --> 03:52.792
Well, I think there are 1011 copies around.

03:52.812 --> 03:54.314
But it's on an awfully high price.

03:56.136 --> 03:59.540
Some of those things, we think it was a high price.

04:00.261 --> 04:01.743
Now we look at auction catalogs.

04:03.885 --> 04:05.067
And the price is staggier.

04:05.547 --> 04:09.752
Well, I went to the garden auction in New York three weeks ago.

04:09.772 --> 04:12.115
And the Shakespeare's went for $2 million.

04:12.756 --> 04:17.261
The increments and the bids were in $50,000 increments.

04:17.281 --> 04:18.002
$50,000

04:18.370 --> 04:20.033
to stay in the bidding.

04:20.053 --> 04:29.008
That's how much Huntington paid for Gutenberg Bible in 1911, $50,000, which was a staggering figure then.

04:29.068 --> 04:31.251
Of course it was.

04:31.271 --> 04:38.403
Well, I went to the street of sale because we bought two big books for us.

04:40.747 --> 04:43.311
First time we ever had enough money to buy anything like that.

04:43.932 --> 04:44.513
Which were they?

04:44.898 --> 04:51.167
We bought the first sermon delivered in this country before the full ones in 1621.

04:51.227 --> 04:58.638
And of course, it had to be printed in England because there was no clean pressure.

04:58.738 --> 05:01.241
We paid $10,000 for it.

05:01.822 --> 05:04.126
So when approximately was this?

05:04.326 --> 05:09.854
Oh, gosh, it was about the 57, maybe in the 60s.

05:09.954 --> 05:12.137
Did you consider that a lot of money then?

05:12.792 --> 05:18.058
$10,000 is unheard of for us to pay $10,000 for a book.

05:18.298 --> 05:23.003
And then they thought, we actually, we really didn't have the money.

05:24.845 --> 05:29.750
But I brought it to the council's direction that these two things were coming up.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.473
I knew Tom's freedom.

05:34.375 --> 05:38.800
And I read part of the preface to the sermon.

05:39.252 --> 05:44.579
and served some attention there and said, well, Tom Adams said, well, let's make a sporting venture.

05:44.659 --> 05:46.421
Let's see if we can raise some money to get that.

05:46.522 --> 05:47.703
This is Tom Adams.

05:47.723 --> 05:47.823
Yeah.

05:47.843 --> 05:49.766
It could be interesting for me to talk to you, by the way.

05:49.786 --> 05:52.950
Yeah, he doesn't know that great much about books, though.

05:53.851 --> 06:01.962
And then the other thing that was coming up was Maud's relation, the first account of the sale in the Mayflower, and we didn't have that.

06:02.102 --> 06:03.764
Well, Cushing came up first.

06:03.924 --> 06:05.226
My boss was giving for us.

06:05.746 --> 06:06.827
Who is this now?

06:06.887 --> 06:07.548
Mike Walsh.

06:07.728 --> 06:08.149
Mike Walsh.

06:08.469 --> 06:10.792
He's a dealer?

06:10.812 --> 06:12.293
He can kind of interview him now, he's dead.

06:12.393 --> 06:13.695
Okay, but I'm just curious.

06:13.715 --> 06:14.296
Mike Walsh.

06:14.476 --> 06:18.400
This is just because it's just the name on the tape, so just so I know what we're talking about.

06:18.440 --> 06:22.825
Michael J. Walsh was an arcana man of good speed.

06:22.845 --> 06:23.186
Okay, good, fine.

06:23.206 --> 06:24.567
He's waiting for you.

06:24.747 --> 06:32.496
And he was actually put in charge of this position of the library by Tom Sweden.

06:32.628 --> 06:34.911
He had great faith, and Mike Walsh and everybody did.

06:34.932 --> 06:36.073
He was one of the great men.

06:37.295 --> 06:39.198
George Goodspeed can tell you a lot about him.

06:41.341 --> 06:45.307
Well, Mike was in front of us, and I didn't know.

06:45.368 --> 06:50.796
Of course, they make a little movement of their hand, you know, when they're taking a bid, and I couldn't see anything.

06:50.816 --> 06:55.042
When they went for $10,000, I thought, well, that's not too bad.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.284
We have 16 left.

06:56.505 --> 07:00.070
We've collected 26,000.

07:01.197 --> 07:03.779
When the march came up, I said, I don't go for less.

07:03.799 --> 07:07.083
Well, it's 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

07:08.364 --> 07:10.005
And it was knocked down at 16 times.

07:10.025 --> 07:11.507
Ah, that's just what you had.

07:11.567 --> 07:11.767
Yeah.

07:12.468 --> 07:17.052
And I didn't know that we had it, you know.

07:17.072 --> 07:24.980
And so, then Mike, I didn't know they turned around and looked at me or not, but it was a great day.

07:25.700 --> 07:26.541
Where was the ocean?

07:26.801 --> 07:29.584
In New York.

07:29.885 --> 07:31.567
That was one of the great libraries that you saw.

07:31.908 --> 07:32.809
The Street of Sales.

07:32.829 --> 07:33.530
The Street of Sales.

07:33.750 --> 07:36.153
There were four, I think, four catalogs.

07:37.435 --> 07:41.220
They are a copyist in the United Society.

07:41.240 --> 07:48.789
No, he was, he did a great collection on railroads, and I guess, one of his collections he gave the American Antiquarian Society.

07:48.809 --> 07:50.672
So, you know, it's not true to very well.

07:50.772 --> 07:52.174
He was a member there, too.

07:52.554 --> 07:55.939
He lived in, I think it was, I guess.

07:56.259 --> 07:58.542
What was the source of his wealth there?

07:59.416 --> 08:07.944
Well, I think he was a lawyer, and I was told that he made and lost money.

08:08.024 --> 08:15.411
And I think his father, I've also been told, was the lawyer for an everyday career.

08:16.812 --> 08:17.072
Really?

08:17.092 --> 08:17.313
Yeah.

08:17.333 --> 08:18.554
I think you've got to check him over.

08:18.574 --> 08:19.495
Oh, yeah, check everything.

08:19.535 --> 08:20.816
Yeah, yeah.

08:20.836 --> 08:24.419
And so Tom was a wonderful fellow.

08:24.439 --> 08:27.482
Why do you think he didn't give the collection away?

08:27.800 --> 08:33.849
No, he was a collector that felt that all people ought to have a chance at these great things, which he had collected.

08:33.869 --> 08:38.817
This is a theme that I would explore, too, you know, like the Bradley Martin sale that's going on now.

08:40.279 --> 08:45.086
Some feel that they had great fun, and why not shouldn't some other people have fun.

08:45.126 --> 08:49.413
How do you feel about that?

08:49.914 --> 08:51.897
Well, I am in favor of it, sure.

08:51.917 --> 08:54.060
Even though you're on the institutional side,

08:54.209 --> 08:56.792
Well, if it spreads around, usually some of it comes back to us.

08:57.012 --> 09:00.476
You don't get them all, and you can't hope to get them all.

09:00.496 --> 09:07.343
And besides, that's not our first purpose in collecting.

09:07.363 --> 09:14.190
I mean, we do collect Massachusetts imprints, and so we have a fine collection there.

09:14.911 --> 09:21.698
But we don't compare with the Apparent Society, which has been the first place on, because they collect it widely.

09:21.718 --> 09:23.760
And they were fairly in the game, and they have

09:24.095 --> 09:31.884
the Isaiah, the Thomas collection of Sabbath.

09:32.645 --> 09:49.143
So our interest really, we do collect infants of Massachusetts and things relating to Massachusetts, but we do not go way out trying to collect everything that comes along.

09:49.163 --> 09:50.524
Let somebody else do that.

09:50.665 --> 09:52.887
No one can really collect

09:53.035 --> 09:55.378
on a national scale in my country.

09:55.398 --> 09:59.642
Marcus Bond called the American Antiquarian Society National Library of American History.

09:59.763 --> 10:03.827
There's no library except the Library of Congress, in my view.

10:04.628 --> 10:11.416
And I bet that practically every state was collecting the same things, because they had own state papers.

10:11.436 --> 10:12.237
Which is good.

10:12.257 --> 10:14.259
I think it is good, yeah.

10:14.980 --> 10:22.148
But the Antiquarian Society has a marvelous collection, and especially in some newspapers that we all know.

10:22.769 --> 10:27.176
You have some wonderfully eccentric things, too.

10:27.196 --> 10:31.542
I think that's one of the things you find with private collectors often is eccentricity.

10:32.223 --> 10:35.468
You know, somebody might collect railway tickets or something.

10:35.608 --> 10:36.529
Oh, yes, yes.

10:36.710 --> 10:48.307
I've just finished reading a book written by the fellow, read it last night, as a matter of fact, who's head of the Children's Museum here, I guess.

10:48.327 --> 10:49.789
And he collects postcards.

10:51.490 --> 10:53.753
I have a wonderful collection of postcards.

10:54.273 --> 10:55.995
You know whose collection of postcards I am?

10:56.095 --> 10:57.657
Francis Henry Taylor's collection.

10:57.697 --> 10:57.978
Oh, really?

10:58.839 --> 10:59.299
Uh-huh.

10:59.740 --> 11:02.523
I bought it at the Clark auction, as a matter of fact.

11:02.543 --> 11:02.683
Uh-huh.

11:02.723 --> 11:04.746
Remember they had an auction there a couple of years ago?

11:04.906 --> 11:05.647
Yeah, yeah.

11:06.327 --> 11:07.309
And I went there.

11:07.329 --> 11:07.989
Oh, shut this up.

11:08.009 --> 11:08.730
There's more than that.

11:09.751 --> 11:12.655
There's a man, the name of Braco, I think.

11:12.675 --> 11:17.160
It was just a paperback, .

11:17.478 --> 11:23.624
And from the time he was just a boy who started collecting postcards, his father would send him postcards.

11:23.644 --> 11:29.790
And he's continued all his life, and his book was completely involved with postcards, all the events of his life.

11:29.810 --> 11:30.690
He was fascinating.

11:30.710 --> 11:32.432
He gave one of the best talks I've ever heard.

11:32.452 --> 11:33.133
Is this a new book?

11:33.913 --> 11:34.454
I think so.

11:34.654 --> 11:36.816
It was in the Western Public Library.

11:36.836 --> 11:37.377
You know the book?

11:38.218 --> 11:38.318
Hmm?

11:38.338 --> 11:39.299
I think I know the book.

11:39.319 --> 11:39.419
Yeah.

11:40.139 --> 11:40.299
Yeah.

11:40.420 --> 11:46.185
And so he talked before the Harvard Federalist book.

11:47.380 --> 11:58.515
And over a year, he was down in the middle of Africa living with a native tribe.

11:59.216 --> 12:02.620
He was a world scholar from Illinois.

12:02.900 --> 12:04.643
I thought he was English.

12:04.683 --> 12:07.326
He was actually from Illinois.

12:07.526 --> 12:10.811
And he's been involved in all sorts of things.

12:10.831 --> 12:14.856
And I was here, head of the, I think, Children's Museum.

12:16.844 --> 12:21.931
And here's a count of the living with this Indian tribe.

12:22.011 --> 12:24.214
There were only about a hundred in the tribe.

12:25.416 --> 12:27.178
And they just got off the plane.

12:27.198 --> 12:28.380
They dropped him off the plane.

12:28.400 --> 12:31.484
He walked through the jungle with a guide for a while.

12:31.524 --> 12:33.847
Then the guide deserted him as soon as he was paid off.

12:34.928 --> 12:36.911
And he went along and said, yes, it's that.

12:36.931 --> 12:37.812
Who wouldn't be?

12:37.933 --> 12:40.476
Is this in the book or is this?

12:40.716 --> 12:42.779
It's partly talked about in the book.

12:42.819 --> 12:45.703
Because they tell us about just being dropped off in a plane.

12:46.342 --> 12:50.128
straight ahead because he didn't know where he was in the jungle.

12:51.590 --> 12:53.273
And he must have a lot of courage.

12:54.315 --> 13:03.510
And finally, he came to the natives, and they looked at him for a while, and then they accepted him and lived with him for a year.

13:03.590 --> 13:06.795
And he was absolutely fascinated by them.

13:07.416 --> 13:09.840
I'm going to have to talk to this guy.

13:09.880 --> 13:11.202
He's a very interesting man.

13:11.738 --> 13:19.227
And he got to know very many people there, some of the top people and some of the writers and so forth.

13:19.347 --> 13:22.270
I decided to look at it last night, and I said, kind of a book is this.

13:22.590 --> 13:25.754
And I noticed the name.

13:25.774 --> 13:26.775
So I went ahead and read it.

13:27.096 --> 13:29.598
It's about 100 pages, something like that.

13:29.618 --> 13:32.382
But it's all based on postcards.

13:32.402 --> 13:33.303
I think I have the book.

13:33.443 --> 13:35.745
I know the book.

13:35.785 --> 13:39.610
My book is not just about books by no stretch of advantage.

13:39.750 --> 13:41.492
It's collecting things

13:41.995 --> 13:45.741
which tend to document the way we have lived.

13:45.761 --> 13:47.824
And I think it goes back to Jeremy Belmatt.

13:47.844 --> 13:51.250
I mean, he said, we need a good repository.

13:52.291 --> 14:00.324
Yes, of course, he saw too much of the things being destroyed and burned up and so forth, and so forth.

14:00.344 --> 14:03.409
Do you think he actually saw this?

14:03.429 --> 14:04.130
I don't think so.

14:04.210 --> 14:07.395
Ted Shipman used to say a lot of them had disappeared because of that.

14:07.679 --> 14:12.224
I mean, but this sort of abuse was going around.

14:12.425 --> 14:14.307
It was rampant that he was cognizant of it.

14:14.327 --> 14:14.567
Yeah, sure.

14:14.827 --> 14:15.348
Sure he was.

14:15.388 --> 14:16.289
He knew there was love.

14:17.190 --> 14:27.963
And he goes and his own accounts of things are going to places and finding things just scattered around and piles and rotting away.

14:28.303 --> 14:30.245
Where can I read some of this stuff?

14:30.646 --> 14:32.127
What kind of stuff I'm looking for?

14:32.147 --> 14:36.893
Well, actually, Lem Tucker is hoping to

14:37.396 --> 14:38.877
write an account of him.

14:38.957 --> 14:44.202
I did just an essay somewhere, probably a copy of society.

14:44.883 --> 14:57.374
It was done by a director by the name of Lord, who just edited a kind of sketches of book people.

14:57.434 --> 14:59.095
Is this something that I can see?

15:00.076 --> 15:02.138
I have to see if it's a copy here.

15:03.159 --> 15:04.420
I have a copy of it.

15:04.500 --> 15:06.762
Oh, it certainly did a full

15:07.332 --> 15:12.119
a reference of my book, but the kind of information.

15:12.380 --> 15:20.992
Yeah, Clifford Law was a man who was a very well-known historian and director of libraries, mostly historical societies.

15:21.013 --> 15:24.778
But that's the kind of thing that I'm looking to see.

15:25.359 --> 15:27.382
I'm certainly not going to write a whole book about that.

15:27.642 --> 15:28.203
Oh, no.

15:28.223 --> 15:30.767
He may account for five or ten pages in my book.

15:31.268 --> 15:32.490
But he died yet, too.

15:32.530 --> 15:34.032
He died yet, but look what he established.

15:35.024 --> 15:40.949
Well, you'll find the accounts of all the things in the press writings about proceedings.

15:40.969 --> 15:41.169
Okay.

15:41.189 --> 15:41.390
Uh-huh.

15:41.470 --> 15:45.353
And these are, I could come in and read some of these.

15:45.373 --> 15:46.334
You read them in the ad press?

15:46.394 --> 15:46.654
Sure.

15:46.774 --> 15:48.016
Okay.

15:48.036 --> 15:50.478
And there must be an index to look up on that point.

15:50.518 --> 15:53.300
Oh, there's indexes all over there.

15:53.320 --> 15:56.183
See, these are the collections.

15:56.203 --> 15:58.765
These are the proceedings.

15:58.905 --> 16:04.390
Index, yeah.

16:04.673 --> 16:12.240
And there ought to be indexed the first of 1791.

16:12.681 --> 16:16.084
So the index had to be 25.

16:16.144 --> 16:22.690
But if I wanted to find out this background and these things you should tell me about Belknap reporting, having seen this stuff piled up and being destroyed.

16:23.351 --> 16:26.214
Well, he was a minister up in Dover, New Hampshire.

16:26.234 --> 16:28.836
And he wrote a history of New Hampshire, and everybody said it was pretty good.

16:28.876 --> 16:33.060
It's a very good history of New Hampshire, yes.

16:40.212 --> 16:42.116
There are the references on film map right there.

16:47.346 --> 16:47.446
Okay.

16:48.869 --> 16:49.671
Reverend Jeremy.

16:49.771 --> 16:52.356
Now these are all references here, right here in the proceeds?

16:52.376 --> 16:54.139
Yeah, they're in the proceeds.

16:56.023 --> 16:58.167
Okay, this is volume 1791, 1883.

16:59.149 --> 17:01.073
Let's write it down so I don't have to go looking for it again.

17:01.660 --> 17:02.721
1791, 1883.

17:04.043 --> 17:07.348
And then that refers me to articles that are in all these proceedings.

17:07.368 --> 17:08.529
Yeah, in the M.H.S.

17:08.549 --> 17:09.050
proceedings.

17:09.070 --> 17:13.095
And you think everything that I need about him, I will find in there.

17:13.115 --> 17:14.457
Most of it you'll find in there.

17:14.477 --> 17:17.541
I think your daily workings and so forth in the beginning of society.

17:17.882 --> 17:25.792
But some of the great anecdotes, how he is said to have sat down with Paul Revere and said to write this, think that.

17:25.952 --> 17:29.457
Well, he did, Paul Revere's account.

17:32.660 --> 17:35.543
It was done in 1798, and it's the fullest account.

17:36.665 --> 17:39.247
He wrote for Jeremy Donner, the last one to write.

17:39.708 --> 17:43.272
Is that the kind of thing I'll find in the proceedings?

17:43.292 --> 17:44.493
Sure.

17:44.513 --> 17:48.218
If you don't, I'll be disappointed.

17:48.438 --> 17:59.190
Actually, at first, they were trying to get the deposition by Paul Revere about who fired the first shot.

18:00.807 --> 18:09.075
We had an early account of the position written by him, which was in the Deer papers.

18:09.095 --> 18:16.663
And then one of the Deer sisters, two girls, and they both died in the last two years.

18:16.683 --> 18:24.210
And one called me and said that she had found an earlier account of the riot.

18:24.230 --> 18:26.072
It was a rough draft of this riot.

18:26.457 --> 18:27.819
Now, whose sisters were these?

18:27.839 --> 18:28.499
Revears.

18:28.519 --> 18:30.322
They were readers, girls.

18:30.342 --> 18:32.084
They were descendants of Paul Revere.

18:32.104 --> 18:34.026
Descendants of Paul Revere.

18:34.487 --> 18:36.569
So, these things had remained in the family archives.

18:36.589 --> 18:39.192
They were in the family, and the papers were here on deposit.

18:40.714 --> 18:44.578
And so, what happens when you get a phone call like that?

18:44.599 --> 18:45.299
Do you get excited?

18:46.260 --> 18:50.946
I get kind of excited, yes, because I've noticed

18:52.360 --> 19:01.213
And then in a day or two, I was going down to talk to Gloria Club about our collections.

19:01.313 --> 19:08.724
And she said, well, she wouldn't want that.

19:08.784 --> 19:13.711
We'd already get a copy.

19:13.731 --> 19:20.601
And I said, I am going down with Gloria Club to talk about the Society of Stakers.

19:20.621 --> 19:22.283
And I said, I would just

19:22.651 --> 19:25.995
loved to be able to talk about this.

19:26.015 --> 19:30.540
And so she said, oh, well, I guess .

19:32.102 --> 19:33.324
So she gave it to me.

19:33.344 --> 19:36.007
And what was it when you, was it wonderful when you saw it?

19:36.047 --> 19:44.757
Because you see, the first, the later copies were explicated, because not even a damn man to be captured by the British, and I got to use four little words .

19:45.178 --> 19:46.059
So you have that .

19:46.239 --> 19:51.105
They're all printed in a volume of our, what we call our picture books.

19:51.473 --> 19:54.256
all in facsimile.

19:54.276 --> 20:11.573
And with an introduction, we used to have, I guess every year, I don't know, I'm very sorry, it was discontinued, a book, sort of an exhibition, and the book could be about the exhibition.

20:12.453 --> 20:20.181
And we'd have a well-known scholar who'd write the introduction, like Evan Morgan, you know,

20:20.482 --> 20:27.431
It was based on an even series of lectures I had here.

20:27.791 --> 20:37.063
I used to have a theme for them, and this sentence he was.

20:37.163 --> 20:48.177
Fred Merck did one, and Morrison did one, and Frank, I don't think.

20:49.338 --> 20:56.388
my house dinner about two weeks ago.

20:56.408 --> 21:00.855
He's right, and she had Franklin Butler, Franklin Delano.

21:00.875 --> 21:01.155
Not Ken Davis.

21:01.275 --> 21:04.520
No, no, no, no, no, no, Franklin Delano.

21:04.840 --> 21:14.895
And so, we got out right downstairs in the reading room under the shelf there.

21:14.915 --> 21:17.218
We still copy the bill.

21:17.907 --> 21:19.449
It's funny how those things went then.

21:19.810 --> 21:26.779
It was a great day, the day, again, came in 1956.

21:26.900 --> 21:34.210
In the Adams family, Poseidon, the papers had been put here.

21:35.812 --> 21:39.918
They were actually given a room in which to keep the family papers.

21:39.938 --> 21:40.419
Here.

21:40.439 --> 21:41.861
Yes.

21:41.881 --> 21:45.045
And this was strictly extraterritorial.

21:45.734 --> 21:48.878
because nobody else could join me.

21:48.918 --> 21:49.279
Really?

21:50.100 --> 21:58.091
And this went on for years and years, and one of the members of his family was kind of curated.

21:58.111 --> 22:05.442
He was a Henry Adams, and John Adams, who became the director of the President of the East Society in 1950.

22:05.462 --> 22:05.862
The East Society?

22:05.882 --> 22:06.563
The East Society from 50 until 57.

22:06.583 --> 22:08.506
Then he was succeeded by his son, Tom.

22:09.728 --> 22:15.015
And I became director in 57, so I worked for John Adams.

22:16.109 --> 22:27.363
I did a lot of camping around the country, and he was out in the West, and he was a young man, just out of college.

22:27.884 --> 22:42.842
His father was a great railroad man, a great thing, but one of the, I don't know if it was Montana or something like that, and he sent his sons out, and it never panned out, but John Adams was up there for a while, and he'd tell me about it.

22:43.278 --> 22:44.179
experiences.

22:44.520 --> 22:45.261
It was wonderful.

22:45.281 --> 22:47.684
I mean, this was in the West, was it?

22:47.704 --> 22:50.088
It was in the 90s, 1890s.

22:50.529 --> 22:53.873
And a lot of the time, Francis Parkland was a little afterwards.

22:53.893 --> 23:03.107
So I finally, I must have gotten the courage, and I said, Mr. Adams, that started so interesting.

23:03.127 --> 23:06.071
I said, I wish you would write it down.

23:06.091 --> 23:08.434
This is 1956, though.

23:08.775 --> 23:10.197
This was before he retired.

23:12.455 --> 23:17.840
And he finally consented to write down about these stories.

23:18.141 --> 23:24.507
Just one particular story he told me about he and his friend had been out riding.

23:24.527 --> 23:29.232
And it's getting down at dusk, and they were in along the Snake River.

23:29.252 --> 23:31.934
And it was going down what they called a draw.

23:32.495 --> 23:42.445
And when they found a little sort of cabin there, and they went up.

23:43.252 --> 23:54.221
and the lady asked if it would be possible for them to spend the night there.

23:54.241 --> 23:58.765
It was a simple little place, only two rooms, one kitchen, living room, you know, and the second bedroom.

23:58.785 --> 24:02.008
So they invited him, and the husband and the other.

24:02.028 --> 24:10.175
And they had dinner, and then she showed them the bedroom, and two beds in it, you see.

24:10.195 --> 24:13.157
And so he said he and his friend were in one bed,

24:13.458 --> 24:26.791
And then they wondered how the lady was going to handle this situation.

24:26.811 --> 24:31.635
And she said, well, she kind of even dressed in the kitchen and put on a nightgown.

24:31.655 --> 24:36.500
And then she came in bearing a cool oil lamp.

24:37.140 --> 24:42.165
She said, we could greatly see the lady.

24:42.517 --> 24:45.160
who lost the life in heaven.

24:45.180 --> 24:46.101
Simple.

24:46.121 --> 24:49.685
Because I've never become this.

24:49.826 --> 25:03.622
So no man, because then John Adams was, then his late 70s, but all his life he had remembered this woman who had probably no education whatsoever.

25:03.642 --> 25:04.944
But I'm coming.

25:04.964 --> 25:05.104
Didn't.

25:05.124 --> 25:05.264
Didn't.

25:05.284 --> 25:06.385
But she carried that lamp.

25:06.505 --> 25:09.088
And I loved the coal, oil lamp.

25:10.030 --> 25:11.031
What was the word, coal?

25:11.191 --> 25:11.551
Coil?

25:11.872 --> 25:12.152
Coil.

25:12.385 --> 25:18.694
A-L, oil.

25:18.915 --> 25:26.145
I just love that story, and I finally got them to print it, and it's printed in our proceedings.

25:26.165 --> 25:28.048
But you said the great moment came in 1956.

25:28.148 --> 25:41.768
When the great moment came, right after the papers had been here for so many years, and so many scholars had tried to get permission to use them, and usually the family was very reluctant to get permission.

25:42.001 --> 25:42.882
Why do you think so?

25:43.263 --> 25:54.979
Well, they were private family papers, and I guess the feeling was that if they opened it, then there'd be a rush, you know, and everyone would want to get them.

25:54.999 --> 25:56.581
I can't understand that thinking, or anything.

25:56.681 --> 26:04.392
But at any rate, so many scholars are trying to get them.

26:05.033 --> 26:11.822
Samuel Faglimas was doing his biography of John Quincy Adams, and he got along very well, and this was

26:12.123 --> 26:23.260
Mr. Henry Adams, who helped him find materials on papers, he would do the researching for Mr. Demus and he would come out and show him things or write things down for him.

26:23.320 --> 26:26.986
So it was a very untenable relationship.

26:27.006 --> 26:28.949
And Sam Demus was .

26:29.069 --> 26:37.101
He was professor at Yale.

26:37.486 --> 26:48.642
And I was here, and then I came to know him very well.

26:49.443 --> 26:53.869
In fact, I did all the checking for him on his second violin, because he had to go back.

26:53.889 --> 26:55.051
His sabbatical was over.

26:56.052 --> 26:59.817
And I was the only one who knew anything about the collection at that time.

26:59.837 --> 27:05.265
So I checked all his quotations to see if they were accurate and so forth.

27:06.140 --> 27:11.647
He insisted that he was going to paint, and I said, no, I didn't really want any paint.

27:11.767 --> 27:16.533
And now he said, I won't let you do it.

27:16.753 --> 27:18.616
And so I said, well, all right.

27:18.636 --> 27:22.160
I said, we're going to house in Western.

27:22.180 --> 27:23.402
I said, we'll name one moon after you.

27:23.422 --> 27:25.745
I came and stayed with us many times.

27:25.765 --> 27:27.167
You're a wonderful man, really.

27:27.187 --> 27:32.113
So the great moment was when the... And then, the great moment in 56,

27:32.684 --> 27:38.933
was when the Addams Family decided to turn all of their huge collection papers over to the society.

27:38.953 --> 27:40.456
There were no qualifications for that?

27:40.556 --> 27:54.016
Well, uh... With some of the... No, really, yeah, because I went with, uh... What was his first name?

27:54.036 --> 27:56.059
Lyman's not a few of the Addams papers.

27:56.079 --> 27:57.782
His brother.

27:59.745 --> 28:00.666
Oh, there's an older brother.

28:01.085 --> 28:04.531
was working for Time Life.

28:04.551 --> 28:14.046
Time Life put up a lot of money to be able to publish things from the papers.

28:14.066 --> 28:19.154
And I remember Roger Butterfield, he's done the books and so forth.

28:19.234 --> 28:23.481
So Roger Butterfield wanted to meet John Adams and I could come out to Adams' house.

28:24.743 --> 28:38.625
And I can remember, I was asking Mr. Adams if there'd be anything that would be held back.

28:38.645 --> 28:43.833
And then we turned around and said, no.

28:43.853 --> 28:44.094
He said, no.

28:44.114 --> 28:44.675
And no restrictions.

28:44.695 --> 28:45.736
So you've been with the society for how long?

28:46.017 --> 28:46.197
1934.

28:46.217 --> 28:51.966
1934.

28:52.823 --> 28:53.885
But what a perspective.

28:54.085 --> 29:03.218
John Adams, plus I wasn't at all sure of it.

29:03.759 --> 29:05.221
And I didn't think really about it.

29:05.381 --> 29:12.792
I was made librarian when I came back from the service.

29:12.812 --> 29:19.962
And then I worked with John Adams for a long time, and there came a time

29:22.051 --> 29:29.679
I was approached to go to New York Historical Society.

29:29.699 --> 29:33.403
And I went down.

29:33.423 --> 29:33.843
I told John Adams.

29:33.863 --> 29:36.846
He said, well, you must go down there.

29:36.867 --> 29:37.367
And I found out about it.

29:37.387 --> 29:41.792
And again, we were very poor at that time.

29:41.812 --> 29:42.012
Very poor.

29:42.032 --> 29:43.053
This society and the New York?

29:43.073 --> 29:43.513
This society.

29:43.533 --> 29:45.576
Because the New York claims to be very poor now.

29:45.596 --> 29:47.237
They were what they were at one time.

29:47.378 --> 29:49.780
Tom Spreeder was their treasure and they were wealthier.

29:50.047 --> 29:52.771
Well, that's what you have turned to another one.

29:52.791 --> 29:56.155
Yeah, well, that's been a mess, an absolute mess.

29:56.235 --> 30:19.385
So, John Adams, when he was going to retire, he knew about this, and I went down, I told him, back, and when I came back, I went down, and he came up to see me, and he said, well, Stephen, he said, well, Mr. Adams will not come.

30:19.405 --> 30:19.986
He's at the time, and I said,

30:20.945 --> 30:33.103
My wife and I didn't want to leave the game.

30:33.123 --> 30:35.066
I didn't want to leave the society.

30:35.086 --> 30:36.028
And she said, well, I'll tell you what I did.

30:36.048 --> 30:40.474
It needed to advance my salary, which had been legal.

30:40.494 --> 30:41.296
There was no money here.

30:41.316 --> 30:43.118
It's rich in materials.

30:43.138 --> 30:45.602
It's much better off now.

30:46.072 --> 30:49.858
One thing I wanted to do was build an addition to it.

30:49.918 --> 30:57.008
We didn't know things come in, especially if you think of a whole range of shows.

30:58.270 --> 31:06.081
And so then he sought what else his choice becomes less than.

31:06.161 --> 31:15.555
So in the 55 years that you've been here, would you say that if you were to pick one single event, would you say then that it was the

31:16.278 --> 31:21.246
Well, the Adams family papers, that is the greatest moment for you.

31:21.266 --> 31:25.913
And at the same time, we were given the .

31:25.933 --> 31:34.266
So, you see, there was a double barrel of them, and I said, I never would see this again.

31:34.286 --> 31:36.950
The paper was absolutely huge of those, just 500,000 papers.

31:36.970 --> 31:38.813
We're talking about the Adams family papers.

31:38.833 --> 31:43.180
Well, this will occupy scholars well into the next century, from what I understand.

31:43.683 --> 31:51.273
Well, they expect that they have the money to continue it, a hundred dollars.

31:51.293 --> 31:55.679
Harvard's involved with this, isn't it?

31:55.699 --> 31:55.779
Yes.

31:56.460 --> 32:04.610
So those are just... But that's good, because you have the backing of a university press which will put the funding that goes along with that.

32:04.630 --> 32:07.714
Well, for the plenty of the violence on it.

32:07.734 --> 32:12.981
The funding hasn't come along from the National Historical Publications Commission.

32:14.075 --> 32:16.199
and with help of some of the foundations.

32:17.661 --> 32:22.890
But foundations don't like long projects, I think.

32:22.910 --> 32:24.312
They've got something accomplished.

32:24.853 --> 32:27.858
But you're not going to accomplish any of these things.

32:27.878 --> 32:38.015
So, oh, there are five different... I don't want to lose any of this, so I have to just keep checking.

32:38.055 --> 32:40.639
There are five different projects.

32:41.615 --> 32:47.702
The Franklin papers were being done at Yale and the American Philosophical Society.

32:47.722 --> 32:50.125
They both had four inches.

32:50.145 --> 32:54.390
The Hamilton papers were done at Columbia.

32:55.891 --> 32:57.213
They were completed.

32:57.914 --> 33:01.658
As the editor said, thank God for birth.

33:06.103 --> 33:08.466
That's wonderful.

33:08.969 --> 33:10.190
Is that on the record?

33:10.371 --> 33:12.013
Did somebody actually say it?

33:12.033 --> 33:12.914
Yeah, he said it.

33:12.954 --> 33:16.698
You were told he said it.

33:17.039 --> 33:19.682
Who is the editor?

33:19.702 --> 33:21.103
You'll find his name on it.

33:21.664 --> 33:24.708
He is Professor Plumby.

33:25.008 --> 33:31.275
Then the Washington papers, right now being the University of Virginia.

33:31.296 --> 33:33.438
But you would have to say that these are unique.

33:34.439 --> 33:36.782
They were never opened up.

33:37.184 --> 33:40.388
But give me some sense of their importance in your words.

33:40.408 --> 33:47.016
Well, you have all the, you have the diaries, the greatest diary, probably, is the diary of John Quincy Adams.

33:47.036 --> 33:50.461
That goes on and on and on and on.

33:50.481 --> 33:53.184
And his son, Charles Francis.

33:53.204 --> 33:58.130
Well, he was a minister of Great Britain during the Civil War.

33:58.351 --> 33:58.791
Secretary of State.

33:59.452 --> 34:03.377
And, well, John Quincy Adams was Secretary of State and President.

34:03.560 --> 34:09.788
John Adams was one of the mainstays in the adoption, of course.

34:10.809 --> 34:16.136
And then the son of Henry, and... Yeah, that goes on, but then we haven't... These will not be included.

34:16.156 --> 34:16.937
They'll be included.

34:17.618 --> 34:22.765
This edition is supposed to go up through 1889, when the wife of Charles Francis Evans dies.

34:23.706 --> 34:26.670
That's the first three generations, you see.

34:26.690 --> 34:28.092
And, of course, you have Africa.

34:28.112 --> 34:29.234
But Henry Adams led us.

34:31.296 --> 34:32.318
Which was published.

34:32.338 --> 34:32.638
Yeah, Harvard.

34:33.800 --> 34:36.903
Harvard Press did that.

34:36.984 --> 34:44.652
Harvard Press did it, but... Well, I felt strongly they should be done.

34:45.153 --> 34:48.336
In fact, at first I was thinking of doing Justice Celci letters.

34:48.777 --> 34:51.099
So wonderful, those letters.

34:53.602 --> 34:58.628
So then the question came up about how much they were going to do.

34:58.648 --> 35:01.731
And I went over, Tom Wilson was in,

35:02.116 --> 35:07.282
He was a great director.

35:07.302 --> 35:15.190
And so, you know, when I was asked to go over, and I talked about, I thought, .

35:15.230 --> 35:21.678
Because truthfully, I'm a little tired of Henry Adams after all.

35:21.798 --> 35:25.462
Everyone who came here wanted to work on Henry Adams, you see.

35:25.482 --> 35:29.406
Francis Taylor came in one day.

35:29.926 --> 35:42.003
He had retired from the Metropolitan, he was in Worcester, and he said, I have been commissioned to do an introduction to St.

35:42.224 --> 35:43.445
Michel.

35:44.286 --> 35:46.450
He said, I don't really know anybody.

35:46.470 --> 35:48.132
He said, I was just there as a young man.

35:48.613 --> 35:54.701
So, he said, could I look at the papers?

35:54.721 --> 35:58.667
And so, in this case, I brought him up and set him down.

35:59.508 --> 36:05.338
and he came down about two hours later.

36:05.358 --> 36:07.561
He said, what a wonderful man.

36:08.823 --> 36:10.186
God, I said, here goes another one.

36:11.087 --> 36:12.690
They're all so-and-so.

36:12.710 --> 36:20.343
When I went over to have a person, I said, look, I said, we have more people coming to this society to work on Henry Adams and read his letters.

36:20.363 --> 36:23.448
I said, they are, I think, at Gouldmine.

36:23.828 --> 36:26.072
The Gouldmine has done some copies.

36:26.322 --> 36:36.672
But the six volumes are out, and an awful lot to do with them, because I pushed it, and I hope get some money for them through one of the others.

36:36.692 --> 36:40.135
And that maybe diverts some of the attention of the scholars now back to the other.

36:40.435 --> 36:44.579
Now that they're out, now the other Adams family members might get even a bit of attention.

36:46.040 --> 36:47.822
You've said ahead of one angle.

36:47.842 --> 36:51.825
I don't, I think they're all very bright, and all can write.

36:51.966 --> 36:53.727
All seem to be able to write.

36:53.767 --> 36:54.608
And they enjoyed writing.

36:54.807 --> 37:15.128
He literally died in the house floor.

37:15.243 --> 37:21.151
No, no, he was taken into a... But I mean, he was... He was right in action, right up for a while.

37:21.211 --> 37:22.232
He was there when he hit.

37:22.973 --> 37:25.456
I have liked John Quincy Adams.

37:25.476 --> 37:29.822
A lot of people found him very hysterical and so forth.

37:29.842 --> 37:34.067
But I have great admiration for him and the way he stuck in and did his job.

37:34.367 --> 37:35.369
He didn't want to retire.

37:35.549 --> 37:37.431
He never wanted to retire.

37:37.451 --> 37:39.634
Well, he went back to the House.

37:39.854 --> 37:41.857
He was a president to go back to the House.

37:42.358 --> 37:45.081
I don't suppose that the Adamses have ever been really great for us.

37:46.192 --> 37:47.633
That they served their country well.

37:47.653 --> 37:48.794
They served them well.

37:48.815 --> 37:54.400
But I think John, Quincy Adams was a great session.

37:54.420 --> 37:57.903
I think Dean was also killed as the Secretary of State.

37:57.923 --> 38:00.045
It was a great triumph.

38:00.065 --> 38:02.668
So that's a great day for the Historical Society.

38:02.748 --> 38:08.173
What would the alternative have been, do you think, if they hadn't have given them to the United States?

38:08.193 --> 38:10.455
They wouldn't have sold these things.

38:10.475 --> 38:15.540
Well, we had a session out in Quincy, and we talked about the necessity of

38:16.027 --> 38:17.790
and making them available.

38:18.210 --> 38:20.994
And we talked first with a microtome addition.

38:21.095 --> 38:22.597
And they agreed to that.

38:22.617 --> 38:25.040
We went ahead and made a microtome.

38:25.061 --> 38:33.553
And I told her, I don't know how many sets now, but they must be set all over the world.

38:33.573 --> 38:35.777
It must have been a pretty expensive thing.

38:35.937 --> 38:36.458
It was.

38:36.478 --> 38:36.898
It was.

38:36.918 --> 38:40.484
And it was, we signed off a lot.

38:40.504 --> 38:43.468
I can't remember it was $3,000.

38:43.718 --> 38:44.940
I would guess more than that.

38:44.960 --> 38:47.523
Well, half a million patients.

38:48.004 --> 38:49.266
I think it's probably .

38:54.493 --> 39:06.790
They have an arrangement .

39:07.090 --> 39:10.715
That's how that was, that's a great day, and there's another great day, isn't there?

39:10.735 --> 39:13.959
Great collection, but no one would talk to you, honestly.

39:14.019 --> 39:15.321
That's the greatest thing.

39:15.341 --> 39:17.083
It's a point, and so forth.

39:17.103 --> 39:18.445
Do you collect anything yourself?

39:18.945 --> 39:19.947
No.

39:19.967 --> 39:21.228
It is a point never to collect it.

39:21.248 --> 39:22.890
So why is that?

39:22.910 --> 39:24.833
Because your energy had to be focused here, I guess.

39:25.594 --> 39:29.038
Well, what's the sense, I mean, of my trying to collect?

39:29.399 --> 39:30.560
None whatsoever.

39:30.740 --> 39:32.102
We buy the books we like.

39:32.322 --> 39:35.106
My wife and I have our own.

39:35.542 --> 39:40.186
She's a reader.

39:42.488 --> 39:45.491
Well, we haven't got another inch of space at home.

39:46.712 --> 40:02.147
But I think what I'm driving at is I think that you certainly, every time you express these, you talk about these great moments when these things came into society, you're talking like a collector, but you are collecting from society.

40:02.167 --> 40:04.789
And I think you're getting your kick, Adam,

40:05.242 --> 40:06.864
These things come in here.

40:06.924 --> 40:08.345
They don't have to come into your home.

40:09.506 --> 40:11.088
I don't know.

40:11.148 --> 40:11.448
I know.

40:11.669 --> 40:12.670
That's very true.

40:12.690 --> 40:15.853
That's my great feeling was in collecting manuscripts.

40:15.873 --> 40:20.658
I think in the institutional level, I find this with dedicated people like yourself.

40:21.719 --> 40:23.401
You know, what's the point?

40:23.481 --> 40:24.702
I mean, I've got everything here.

40:24.922 --> 40:26.884
This is where it matters.

40:26.944 --> 40:33.291
Well, you also, for example, one of the collections I got just before I retired,

40:36.730 --> 40:38.252
It was rather strange.

40:42.937 --> 40:53.088
And I didn't know where it was.

40:53.108 --> 40:56.252
It was the collection of Sin of the Hoa.

40:56.412 --> 41:00.837
And I couldn't get any information about it.

41:01.077 --> 41:05.742
And finally, Ted Chipman heard some clue about it.

41:06.937 --> 41:17.351
I was still in Boston, up in Needham.

41:17.371 --> 41:26.623
And so she invited me up to see her.

41:26.643 --> 41:27.243
And we talked about the table.

41:27.263 --> 41:31.229
They were still looking with her, and invited me to go with her up to see her.

41:31.249 --> 41:34.553
She said, will you bring your lunch, and I'll bring your lunch.

41:34.573 --> 41:35.374
And we said, we'll go up.

41:35.894 --> 41:43.642
This is important stuff, too.

41:44.703 --> 41:55.455
This is important stuff.

41:55.775 --> 42:04.905
And he had been head of every Republican convention.

42:05.510 --> 42:11.957
When I had seen them, she, I don't remember what it was, at the pier house.

42:12.958 --> 42:15.601
No, it was up in Westminster, because we were sitting on a porch.

42:15.621 --> 42:22.068
I remember it was in the trawl, and the bees were posing around, and I thought we were eating a sandwich.

42:22.088 --> 42:30.657
And she said, well, again, you had better tell me why the paper should go to you rather than .

42:31.582 --> 42:34.667
You must have run into this a lot, in competition for things.

42:34.687 --> 42:35.829
Oh, yes, and I did there.

42:35.869 --> 42:41.077
And so, she said, you must write me a letter and tell me why.

42:41.097 --> 42:43.661
Meanwhile, you're concerned that the place might burn out, you know.

42:44.141 --> 42:49.530
So, I wrote a little letter, and I said, well, we had the papers here.

42:49.570 --> 42:54.057
They were on deposit from the Capitol.

42:54.077 --> 42:57.843
She had been sent a weird poem during the same period.

42:57.863 --> 42:58.824
So they didn't make any care.

42:58.844 --> 42:59.445
Yes, they managed.

43:00.505 --> 43:30.445
and she accepted them so i bet you were right there within 24 hours to get this well we had to hire a truck let me see if i have a picture oh my god the heat and that was cool so you see there oh that's a nice little room you have here yeah oh it's a model

43:30.982 --> 43:32.364
How often do you come in?

43:32.404 --> 43:34.347
I come in three or four days, please.

43:39.214 --> 43:40.836
I'll give you one of these if you'd like to have it.

43:41.037 --> 43:42.659
Oh, I'd love to have anything.

43:42.919 --> 43:45.864
Oh, please, yes.

43:45.924 --> 43:52.674
This was done every time, and they did it without knowing anything about it.

43:53.615 --> 43:59.183
Yeah, well, it was—what they did was I—

44:01.002 --> 44:01.843
Are you going to give me that?

44:02.423 --> 44:05.106
Would you describe it for me?

44:05.546 --> 44:07.488
Spoken as a true collector.

44:09.830 --> 44:13.093
I'm just going to shut this off.

44:16.617 --> 44:20.080
They were very clever, you know.

44:20.120 --> 44:21.521
This is the staff.

44:21.561 --> 44:25.285
They got together, and they had the president and everybody else in there.

44:26.106 --> 44:28.528
And they got this portrait out of my house,

44:28.897 --> 44:35.767
And then they had it back in my house by the time I got home from work.

44:35.967 --> 44:40.154
So they had it out, had it photographed, and then got it back again.

44:44.119 --> 44:48.586
So Tom Adams wrote the introduction.

44:50.168 --> 44:54.735
And then Malcolm Freyberg and the others.

44:55.407 --> 45:02.135
and these friends, even these, Carol Dudo, who was an American group viewer, they were all in it.

45:02.155 --> 45:02.896
They printed this.

45:03.397 --> 45:03.737
It's beautiful.

45:03.958 --> 45:08.103
And then they... I can't think of you enough of this, really.

45:09.885 --> 45:10.806
Oh, boy.

45:11.547 --> 45:13.670
That was as I graduated from Parkingworth.

45:15.933 --> 45:22.461
So, and then they had an essay I did on the manuscript collection, and then they took my annual reports.

45:23.285 --> 45:28.912
That photograph was a famous photographer for life.

45:29.292 --> 45:37.282
He did a series of photographs from the time of life that was going to be a support.

45:38.623 --> 45:41.987
That's John Adams.

45:42.147 --> 45:44.750
I was so proud of him.

45:45.111 --> 45:48.555
That's the gentleman who finally said to publish it all.

45:48.875 --> 45:52.920
This is Henry Lee Shattuck.

45:54.233 --> 45:59.298
who gave us more money than he ever received from anybody.

46:00.199 --> 46:05.345
I would say, I'd say, you know, a million and a half.

46:05.445 --> 46:05.785
Wow.

46:06.146 --> 46:09.289
And then there's the books.

46:09.309 --> 46:15.556
He gave us the Copley book of John Hancock, and what was that, Prince of Zay?

46:15.576 --> 46:16.797
Millions.

46:16.837 --> 46:17.097
Millions.

46:18.079 --> 46:22.283
And he always had a liking for the Irish.

46:22.381 --> 46:32.742
Now this man is a benefactor, is a collector, even if he's not sure.

46:33.163 --> 46:33.603
Mr. Shattuck?

46:33.664 --> 46:37.892
If a man does something like that...

46:38.429 --> 46:40.772
Thomas Candleside Trekkens.

46:40.812 --> 46:44.196
That was a man who made the great fortune in China, Drayton.

46:44.276 --> 46:47.380
He was one of the first to go over there in a supercar.

46:47.400 --> 46:48.121
He was in the 1970s.

46:48.442 --> 46:51.065
He must be well represented at the Essex Institute then.

46:51.145 --> 46:52.086
How about that happened?

46:52.106 --> 46:52.867
Salem?

46:54.570 --> 46:58.695
Maybe at Peabody, but not so much.

46:58.715 --> 46:59.336
He was in Boston.

46:59.356 --> 47:04.542
He was in politics, and then this was Alan Forbes who hired him.

47:04.562 --> 47:06.765
He had a great salary of $25 a week.

47:07.015 --> 47:08.137
which was not bad in 1934.

47:08.157 --> 47:10.801
These are friends of mine.

47:10.882 --> 47:19.937
This is the man when we were talking about trying to get these two rare books.

47:19.997 --> 47:25.426
He taught at MIT.

47:25.607 --> 47:32.398
He said I had some small distinction.

47:33.374 --> 47:36.978
And he had this kid come over and something that needed to hear.

47:38.099 --> 47:42.824
He could slip Tom Adams and make it to help get those books or stuff.

47:42.924 --> 47:45.026
And he needed to get a place and sell it.

47:45.047 --> 47:46.488
That's this gentleman here?

47:46.508 --> 47:46.608
Yeah.

47:46.628 --> 47:47.870
And his name is?

47:48.290 --> 47:49.391
Henry Adamus Sever.

47:49.411 --> 47:49.752
Ah, okay.

47:50.332 --> 47:50.733
Sever.

47:51.033 --> 47:53.395
Yeah, and Hamilton was very good to us, too.

47:54.116 --> 48:00.003
And so these were, that's a typical Adam's face.

48:00.143 --> 48:03.246
I have a drawing of him that the artist didn't hear to me.

48:04.424 --> 48:09.829
That was the man alive.

48:09.849 --> 48:13.913
This was Stuart Mitchell, who was the director before me, a brilliant man.

48:15.094 --> 48:16.375
This is the top half the roof.

48:16.475 --> 48:17.776
It was a dirigible going back.

48:18.097 --> 48:25.403
Now, when you were going to Clark University, did you have any idea that you would be doing this kind of work?

48:26.504 --> 48:28.406
I didn't know what I'd be doing.

48:28.666 --> 48:32.710
All I know is that I always loved books.

48:33.145 --> 48:39.792
And at the age of 15, I started working with the public library.

48:39.892 --> 48:43.696
I stayed there until I came down here.

48:43.756 --> 48:46.999
I worked in the reference department.

48:47.019 --> 48:49.902
There are such wonderful people there.

48:51.043 --> 49:01.954
Most of the people in the reference department were some of the graduates of the early women's colleges, like Smith.

49:02.221 --> 49:14.940
One was, her father was a book by the Maude Wesley, and there was a Mr. Robinson, a wonderful stately lady who came from, went to Boston University.

49:15.962 --> 49:30.203
And then the reference librarian was Miss Wood, Grace Wood, a very sort of scared New English interest, but it was wonderful because she was at every commencement.

49:31.398 --> 49:40.688
I mean, MIT, Clark, and so forth, she'd be in the audience to see her voice.

49:41.689 --> 49:48.255
We would grant after books, and eventually as you get older, you're in charge in the evenings and so forth.

49:48.576 --> 49:49.497
I love the library.

49:49.517 --> 49:51.399
So you've always had this reverence for books.

49:51.419 --> 49:54.542
Oh, I've always had that, yeah.

49:54.562 --> 50:00.628
And I guess I got a ticket to the Western Public Library when I was about five.

50:00.929 --> 50:08.199
And I used to go and spend my Sundays there, you know, at Southern Bells on Hunt Street.

50:08.279 --> 50:09.601
Who would know that?

50:09.621 --> 50:12.244
They had a candy store and ice cream and so forth.

50:12.264 --> 50:15.609
You know, you'd get a sack of pink about that size of a nickel.

50:17.251 --> 50:19.013
What do you feel when you walk in this building?

50:19.214 --> 50:21.897
When you're surrounded by these wonderful things?

50:22.959 --> 50:29.788
Well, I'm so used to them now, but they move me every time I see them.

50:31.051 --> 50:37.198
Well, there are two.

50:37.318 --> 50:41.482
One is a teacher's French and Greek's college, a nun.

50:42.103 --> 50:50.773
And the other is a head of the foster department, also a nun at St.

50:50.873 --> 50:53.175
Joseph's College .

50:53.195 --> 50:57.480
So I came out and I put out some of the big declarations of independence and death.

50:58.017 --> 51:04.045
And the first and second drafts of the United States Constitution.

51:04.065 --> 51:04.686
Not bad.

51:04.706 --> 51:05.807
Not bad.

51:05.827 --> 51:17.663
We have the journal kept by John Winfrey from North that time.

51:18.665 --> 51:20.687
By the society or by a publishing?

51:20.928 --> 51:23.691
No, it'll be done by the society, yeah.

51:24.152 --> 51:26.455
And because the papers

51:27.127 --> 51:56.425
uh have been uh with the papers have been turned not all of them through john whitford's period now confirmed they're twerking on one now on some of the letters crystal letters from lincoln and you have don't have papers in the chest there was this is i was free so you just need to have you'll have to uh help that

51:56.742 --> 51:59.006
I'll be fine.

51:59.146 --> 52:01.530
If Marcus doesn't have this... They'll have them.

52:01.550 --> 52:02.111
I'll come here.

52:03.073 --> 52:07.661
Well, are we getting off your track?

52:07.701 --> 52:08.663
No, no.

52:09.124 --> 52:14.894
No, we were talking about the feeling that you get with these extraordinary things.

52:14.934 --> 52:21.906
You have the Lincoln letters, that exchange of letters for the Gettysburg... Well, you have other things that move you just as greatly.

52:23.472 --> 52:31.926
The Edward Everett exchange with Washington and Lincoln, I think, was one of the greatest exchanges we had in American history.

52:31.946 --> 52:36.012
I mean, because I didn't like Edward Everett.

52:37.655 --> 52:43.845
He married into a Brooks family, as did Charles Francis Adamson and Edward Everett.

52:43.865 --> 52:49.935
Edward Everett and then there was a probably handsome three, and Brooks was an opiate man in this area.

52:51.181 --> 53:10.201
But later on, I don't think that Charles Francis Adams at first liked him very well, but he can't have a change of mind about him, because he did an awful lot going around the country, raising money for restoration in Washington, not running.

53:10.221 --> 53:12.403
But, of course, he was a fine artist.

53:12.484 --> 53:19.551
He was one of the great young scholars, the first to go abroad and to study in German universities.

53:19.615 --> 53:25.422
to see the Russian, the Greek Revolution.

53:25.523 --> 53:27.565
And then he's kept one of the longest diaries.

53:27.665 --> 53:31.971
I'm trying to get, you know, Oscar Handel and do it.

53:32.031 --> 53:35.055
But in the diary, have I told you this before?

53:35.155 --> 53:35.315
No.

53:36.437 --> 53:41.743
Well, of course, he had this great speech to give, which he had prepared.

53:42.885 --> 53:46.189
And he had a program in advance in the Boston Valley Advertising.

53:46.209 --> 53:48.492
And then he took those narrow strips, you know,

53:49.079 --> 54:03.640
And he noted on the fly leaf, I had this printed in advance in the Daily, Boston Daily Advertising, particularly in E2, Gettysburg.

54:04.642 --> 54:06.785
He placed it on the desk and did not look at it.

54:06.805 --> 54:08.247
He gave it from memory.

54:08.567 --> 54:08.888
Really?

54:09.168 --> 54:15.137
And while he said part, he'd gotten part together and so forth.

54:15.758 --> 54:22.709
And they were, that was two hours long, and they listened without apparent uneasiness.

54:22.850 --> 54:31.203
And then he was so tired, I guess, and sat down and making a game of, you know, the best lasted about it.

54:31.223 --> 54:31.865
Perhaps.

54:31.905 --> 54:35.891
He didn't even say anything about it, you know, that puzzle.

54:35.911 --> 54:37.654
He didn't say a word about it.

54:37.674 --> 54:41.901
But the next day, he wrote to Lincoln.

54:43.771 --> 54:46.273
and thanked him for the courtesies extended.

54:46.293 --> 54:48.375
He had his daughter with him.

54:48.715 --> 55:00.887
And he said, I wish I had been as successful in approaching the central idea of the occasion in two hours as you did in two minutes.

55:00.907 --> 55:04.490
And Lincoln replied, we have his work.

55:04.510 --> 55:12.017
In our respective parts yesterday, I could not have been excused to make a sharp address while you are wrong with it.

55:12.037 --> 55:13.558
I am pleased to know that in your

55:13.808 --> 55:17.735
judgment, the little I did say, is not entirely a failure.

55:17.975 --> 55:20.159
Isn't that a wonderful exchange?

55:20.219 --> 55:20.600
Wonderful.

55:20.740 --> 55:21.802
Wonderful exchange.

55:21.822 --> 55:25.268
And I thought the other day... Gracious on both parts, too.

55:25.709 --> 55:26.029
On both sides.

55:26.049 --> 55:26.410
Both sides.

55:26.530 --> 55:28.373
And they were telling the truth, really.

55:28.614 --> 55:30.377
How did these come to the Society?

55:31.198 --> 55:33.102
How did you get... We got all the Lincoln papers.

55:33.202 --> 55:34.143
Edward's papers.

55:34.324 --> 55:34.664
It's useful.

55:34.684 --> 55:37.369
But the Lincoln, of course, the Lincoln letter would come with it, yeah.

55:37.602 --> 55:40.806
Actually, at one time... But how about the letter that he sent to Lincoln?

55:40.846 --> 55:41.527
How did you get that?

55:41.567 --> 55:42.288
He kept a copy.

55:42.809 --> 55:44.111
He kept it in his own hands.

55:44.131 --> 55:45.773
He kept letterbook copies of all those letters.

55:47.074 --> 55:50.539
So he was thinking about the future then, wasn't he?

55:51.761 --> 55:54.023
Well, that was the only way of keeping copies.

55:54.044 --> 55:55.205
There were no Xerox machines.

55:55.245 --> 55:55.906
No, nothing like that.

55:55.986 --> 55:59.110
I mean, you either wrote it or you didn't have it.

55:59.130 --> 56:02.074
And even, for example, when we go,

56:02.695 --> 56:04.337
traveling, which we like to do.

56:04.597 --> 56:06.059
My wife usually keeps a diary.

56:06.079 --> 56:09.603
I did earlier, and then I shifted the job to her.

56:09.643 --> 56:11.985
But otherwise, you can't remember where you've been after a while.

56:12.526 --> 56:16.390
I mean, you have to go back and see, well, where were we in such and such a day?

56:16.410 --> 56:17.331
So that's it.

56:17.351 --> 56:19.874
I suppose that's, he wanted to have a record of what he did.

56:19.894 --> 56:24.520
He was president of Harvard, who was a very great person.

56:24.560 --> 56:27.483
But what he loved was being an ambassador to England.

56:27.543 --> 56:29.125
That was the thing.

56:29.165 --> 56:31.167
That was the pinnacle, isn't it?

56:31.467 --> 56:35.884
I just keep looking at this because I don't want to miss anything because I'm going to have to turn it over.

56:36.145 --> 56:42.709
But anyway, to go back to that story you were telling me, I'm going to just switch the tape on the other side so I don't lose anything.
