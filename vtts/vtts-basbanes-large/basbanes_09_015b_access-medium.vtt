00:03.558 --> 00:13.094
The paradoxical answer to have you sold out, did you take the money off of that?

00:13.375 --> 00:18.544
No, no, but the paradoxical answer is that I sold Father's Day to Alan last year for $25,000.

00:19.165 --> 00:24.013
If I thought this was a commercial novel, if Alan thought it was a commercial novel, I was selling out.

00:24.297 --> 00:25.118
Do I take $25?

00:25.138 --> 00:29.726
You've got to put it on a zero on it, I think, before we start selling out.

00:30.007 --> 00:34.294
Well, not only that, but that wasn't the intention at the time.

00:34.454 --> 00:36.217
That isn't the vocabulary of the players.

00:36.598 --> 00:38.602
That isn't how we think.

00:38.622 --> 00:41.026
We thought we were experimenting.

00:41.046 --> 00:43.390
That John was going to change speeds and try something new.

00:43.730 --> 00:47.677
And when you say we, this is yourself and your editor.

00:47.697 --> 00:47.938
Yes.

00:48.819 --> 00:49.360
And that...

00:49.863 --> 01:01.400
Alan bought a proposal in a first chapter because I was going to use a new vocabulary and try something that hadn't been tried before, which was to write about the Constitution and make a thriller in a post-Cold War era.

01:01.460 --> 01:07.328
Two insights I had that are created as a background to Father's Day.

01:07.949 --> 01:09.251
One, Cold War is over.

01:09.291 --> 01:13.377
Therefore, only the power of the White House is powerful enough to stop the White House.

01:14.278 --> 01:19.566
That shelf of books that you and I have read, the Cold War fiction, it's all gone.

01:20.018 --> 01:20.659
KGB, gone.

01:20.739 --> 01:24.943
Only the power of the White House can stop the White House.

01:24.963 --> 01:25.384
One.

01:25.404 --> 01:29.609
Two, what's really thrilling, what's really scary is the immediate future.

01:29.629 --> 01:35.815
Because we're going to be alive in it, we can't control it, and no one's ever been there.

01:36.036 --> 01:37.637
I put those two things together.

01:37.918 --> 01:44.946
And I came up with what I would call a post-Cold War thriller.

01:45.847 --> 01:47.889
And then how did the movies get involved?

01:47.929 --> 01:49.030
That came from nowhere.

01:49.499 --> 01:53.365
I didn't know about it, didn't know where they were, didn't ever think that way.

01:53.685 --> 01:57.030
I mean, why bother yourself?

01:57.591 --> 01:58.612
No, no, no.

01:58.993 --> 02:18.561
I think the truth of it is, my agent, who's a very, very ambitious 31-year-old woman, maybe Kim Witherspoon, is friends with, of all people, Dick Snyder's son, Matt, who was an agent at CAA, and

02:19.047 --> 02:36.332
He and she had talked about Father's Day and knew how thrilling it was, knew that it had, but they didn't talk to me about this, especially because of my relationship with his father, non-relationship, my episode of his father, and my and Alan's position in public towards his father.

02:36.352 --> 02:39.676
So when the book was done last March, she called me within a week.

02:40.297 --> 02:43.482
Alan called me first and said, Kim's got something to say to you.

02:43.502 --> 02:47.127
I don't know whether you're going to like it, but she's got an agent who very much wants to take your book.

02:47.147 --> 02:47.788
And I said, who?

02:48.342 --> 02:49.543
He said, well, it's PAA.

02:49.563 --> 02:50.384
It's big time.

02:50.404 --> 02:50.845
I said, who?

02:51.306 --> 02:52.327
He said, Matt Snyder.

02:52.347 --> 02:55.691
I said, it's not going to happen, Alan.

02:55.711 --> 02:57.473
He said, now, John, think ahead here.

02:58.214 --> 02:58.774
Don't do this.

02:58.895 --> 03:00.557
You know, that's old news.

03:01.237 --> 03:02.459
And I said, I'm thinking ahead.

03:02.479 --> 03:03.420
It's not going to happen.

03:03.820 --> 03:06.524
That isn't how I write books.

03:06.544 --> 03:07.845
And he said, don't.

03:07.865 --> 03:13.472
And then Kim called me, and she said, now, John, Matt and I had dinner.

03:13.975 --> 03:18.620
He's really excited and he's just sold a book for one and a half million and he thinks he can do better by you.

03:20.082 --> 03:21.784
And I said, it's not going to happen.

03:21.804 --> 03:23.446
Did you say replay that number again?

03:23.586 --> 03:23.946
No.

03:24.287 --> 03:27.250
I said, it's not going to happen.

03:27.270 --> 03:29.032
She said, don't do this to me.

03:29.052 --> 03:31.375
I said, it's not going to happen.

03:31.395 --> 03:33.297
It's not going to happen.

03:33.317 --> 03:34.638
She said, well, how can I tell him this?

03:34.859 --> 03:40.325
I said, well, you can tell him the truth or you can really go.

03:41.546 --> 03:42.227
And within...

03:42.629 --> 04:07.523
four days william morris had come in and called me and said we understand that we hear that and then the frenzy and uh the next week they come down to uci to hear me read the opening chapter my two agents of william morris and kim whom i had and i had had sharp words on monday and i had essentially said well kim we're not going to work together

04:08.752 --> 04:19.185
She flew in from New York that day to pick her up at LAX, and she came to the readings, so I said, my dear Ken, with this gesture, we are together again.

04:19.205 --> 04:20.326
That sort of thing.

04:20.687 --> 04:31.360
And I have a question that's in, the fact that she's as ambitious as I am, and that she recognized that she's not dealing with straightforwardness of that.

04:31.380 --> 04:34.383
She's dealing with somebody who writes things down.

04:35.905 --> 04:37.527
Well, I wouldn't be too pleased.

04:37.810 --> 04:45.019
If you don't do this to me, please, this is my book.

04:45.880 --> 04:47.963
She had a good argument.

04:47.983 --> 04:51.647
She said, you told me when we got together last year.

04:52.168 --> 04:56.734
We met through actually Bob Butler, who found her.

04:56.754 --> 05:03.582
See, I gave Bob to Alan many years ago when Bob was orphaned by one too many enough lives.

05:04.540 --> 05:07.944
And I said, Bob, Bob is the best out of it.

05:08.064 --> 05:09.585
And nobody's handling him well.

05:09.665 --> 05:13.590
So he did a couple of his books at S&S and they treated him even worse.

05:13.610 --> 05:15.231
They treated him terribly.

05:15.612 --> 05:16.693
Well, it's wonderful.

05:16.973 --> 05:26.724
It's wonderful now to, you know, Bob and Alan and I and the rest of Alan's office, we can sit around a table and go, what were they thinking?

05:26.744 --> 05:31.469
But anyway, that's part of the heroism of the story.

05:31.589 --> 05:32.590
The peacock just, you know,

05:32.975 --> 05:58.594
with his way i love this kid i really do i'll never forget the day he walked into my office he said uh bob's very i said he said bob's very happy with her why don't you try so i called her and talked and kim had reminded me while we were having this argument she said you told me that you weren't going to bring any baggage you know that that was behind you i said yes it was and now it's in front of me again and

05:59.249 --> 06:12.309
I let it go, and she let it go, and we're not going to revisit it, although she flinches every time she sees the mention, like in the New York piece, because it's true, the episode and the incident, although we're not talking the Matt Snyder episode now.

06:12.329 --> 06:14.492
We're just talking the general bother thing.

06:14.512 --> 06:15.774
I mean, Dick Snyder's a villain.

06:15.794 --> 06:18.137
But business is business, too.

06:18.177 --> 06:18.658
But it's not.

06:18.798 --> 06:20.140
This isn't business with Snyder.

06:20.160 --> 06:22.223
This is personal.

06:22.344 --> 06:24.607
He tried to hurt Alan, and I hurt him.

06:25.068 --> 06:26.410
And he did?

06:26.430 --> 06:26.590
No.

06:26.924 --> 06:30.388
No, he gave Allen an opportunity that he wouldn't have gotten if he'd stayed at SNS.

06:30.408 --> 06:33.911
This is true, but he wasn't thinking of it.

06:33.931 --> 06:35.233
And that wasn't Dick Snyder's doing.

06:35.253 --> 06:37.956
It was a consequence of Dick Snyder's recklessness.

06:38.036 --> 06:42.761
And Dick Snyder was dealt with by Viacom in the correct fashion.

06:43.582 --> 06:46.745
And he tried to make it into some kind of cruelty.

06:47.166 --> 06:49.989
But in fact, he was just projecting the way he treated people.

06:50.009 --> 06:53.713
They treated him very correctly and wanted to keep him on and honor his contract.

06:53.753 --> 06:55.935
Oh, that is nonsense about them throwing him out.

06:56.438 --> 06:58.180
It's just the baby he is in there.

06:58.520 --> 07:00.983
You know, every 10 millionaire is a baby.

07:01.744 --> 07:11.395
And so my history with Snyder got me to the movies, and then the movies did me within, they had the manuscript.

07:11.575 --> 07:13.798
It is interesting.

07:13.818 --> 07:17.262
The movies had the manuscript, and within three weeks they'd done the auction.

07:18.944 --> 07:19.464
And it was over.

07:19.604 --> 07:23.248
When do you think, what's the, is it on track now?

07:23.308 --> 07:24.109
Oh, I don't know.

07:24.149 --> 07:24.690
I haven't looked.

07:25.379 --> 07:27.141
I followed Hemingway's life.

07:27.221 --> 07:33.107
You know, you go to the state line, you throw the bandit script over, they throw the money back.

07:33.127 --> 07:34.529
You drive home and they drive home.

07:35.130 --> 07:36.731
And God bless.

07:36.751 --> 07:39.094
Actually, on it, I'll take it.

07:39.114 --> 07:40.195
I don't like that.

07:40.536 --> 07:46.582
In 1968, for couples, somebody came in and paid him $400,000.

07:47.223 --> 07:50.166
Never made the movie, so it never bothered him.

07:50.186 --> 07:51.007
And he never looked back.

07:51.728 --> 07:52.729
Check cleared.

07:52.749 --> 07:53.209
That matters.

07:53.750 --> 07:53.850
Yeah.

07:54.472 --> 07:55.373
And he never looked back.

07:57.215 --> 07:58.857
You got it.

07:59.879 --> 08:01.020
14 or 13?

08:05.586 --> 08:07.148
I'm very happy for you, John.

08:07.248 --> 08:09.991
I remember... Look at all those books.

08:10.011 --> 08:20.384
I tell Alan, though, that I pump it up a little bit because some of them are long titles and make it look... He's doing my first book.

08:20.684 --> 08:21.305
Right, I know.

08:21.565 --> 08:23.027
I saw the manuscript when it came in.

08:23.395 --> 08:25.002
And it's going to be...
