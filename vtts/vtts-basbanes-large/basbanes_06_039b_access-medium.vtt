00:05.684 --> 00:09.449
good printing and typographic tape.

00:09.469 --> 00:11.491
But better things were at hand.

00:11.611 --> 00:14.315
I went home that Christmas and asked my father for a printing press.

00:14.835 --> 00:23.346
He went to see Walter Lewis, who was the university printer, and Lewis said, well, that's quite a coincidence, because Michael Hornby has just asked me if I can find a good home for his father's press.

00:24.087 --> 00:25.749
Now, Michael Hornby was the son of St.

00:25.769 --> 00:28.873
John Hornby, the founder of the famous Ashending Press.

00:29.478 --> 00:37.030
And it was, in fact, even more of a coincidence than Lewis thought, because Michael Hornby had been one of my father's pupils at New College in the 20s.

00:37.290 --> 00:46.906
And so before long, I was delighted at pulling the bar of an old 1853 Hopkinson & Cope Royal Albion, one of the very, very best hand presses I've ever set hands on.

00:47.427 --> 00:50.031
Now I've got help as a Southern Methodist.

00:50.051 --> 00:54.658
The Cambridge University Press provided type and advice

00:54.925 --> 01:00.814
And slowly the quality of my work improved, and by the time I got to Oxford as a student I became quite ambitious.

01:01.675 --> 01:09.888
The Duke of Wellington, the then Duke of Wellington, gave me an unpublished contemporary memoir of his great ancestor to print, and it was, by my standards, a runaway bestseller.

01:10.149 --> 01:16.258
I printed and sold a thousand copies, and several of the papers that reviewed it were quite complimentary about its appearance.

01:16.947 --> 01:25.137
The last book I printed was Francis Cornford's last book of poems, 96 pages long, with illustrations in seven colours and an edition of 1,500 copies.

01:26.238 --> 01:32.626
It took two years, and it was actually a bit of a fiasco, because the ordinary edition, which cost 15 shillings, settled out very quickly.

01:33.207 --> 01:36.912
But the limited edition, which was to have been signed by the author, fell through.

01:36.992 --> 01:39.715
She died seven weeks before I printed the last sheet.

01:41.112 --> 01:43.375
It's been an awful lesson to you.

01:43.415 --> 01:48.201
If you're going to have a signed limited edition, print the last sheet first.

01:48.221 --> 02:04.961
Still, all this work brought me in touch with Geoffrey Keynes, who is her cousin by marriage, and I owe to him and Tim Munby, the genial and generous librarian of King's College, Cambridge, my introduction to a wider circle afflicted with the same passion for books that I had.

02:05.061 --> 02:10.748
Well, I'm sorry about this long digression, but it brings me to the founding fathers of the book collector.

02:11.318 --> 02:14.142
John Hayward was and remained the most powerful.

02:14.362 --> 02:21.052
Although a cripple, multiple sclerosis had begun to set in when he was a brilliant undergraduate editor of the works of Rochester.

02:21.753 --> 02:27.340
Now confined to a wheelchair, he conducted business from a desk in a bay window overlooking the Thames on Cheney Road.

02:28.402 --> 02:30.605
Until recently, he had shared a flat with T.S.

02:30.625 --> 02:35.031
Eliot, whose muse and critic he had been during the writing of some of his best poetry.

02:35.332 --> 02:40.438
You actually want to know one of the most gripping accounts of this association.

02:40.478 --> 02:52.991
Read Helen Gardner's fascinating and very sympathetic appreciation in her study of the four quartets, a very moving account of creative process, not to mention John Hayward.

02:53.011 --> 02:57.556
This association came to a very abrupt end with Eliot's second marriage.

02:59.739 --> 03:05.305
To be absolutely exact, Eliot sneaked out before breakfast, leaving a note saying, I've moved out.

03:05.572 --> 03:11.278
And there was a new age as a result to John's always mordant command of those who came to him.

03:11.619 --> 03:13.360
Everyone did come to him.

03:14.041 --> 03:16.584
Printers came to have their proofs excoriated.

03:16.964 --> 03:21.830
Poets abided his merciless tongue for the quality of the creative criticism that he provided.

03:22.530 --> 03:26.555
Librarians and book collectors came to listen to his fascinating and malicious gossip.

03:27.596 --> 03:33.402
No one could leave him without quailing at the thought of what John would say about them now behind their backs.

03:34.057 --> 03:37.742
None failed to come back for fear of what he would say if they did not.

03:40.126 --> 03:54.847
None of this gives any suggestion of the magnetism and charm of this extraordinary man who turned all his weakness into strength, his once handsome face, now a gargoyle, his legs immobile, only one arm moving, but that capable still of writing a beautiful hand.

03:55.608 --> 04:02.798
He dominated the early years of the book collector, although two others, more able-bodied than John, were nominally editors, one of the other,

04:03.115 --> 04:09.825
It was, in fact, John who took all the decisions, chose the articles, and rewrote and criticised till the hapless authors gave in from sheer exhaustion.

04:11.026 --> 04:21.161
He, whose magisterial comments on sales and exhibitions, institutional acquisitions and catalogues, gave the magazine a new and powerful authority in the world of old and rare books and manuscripts.

04:22.623 --> 04:26.108
At the same time, the editorial board was very much a team.

04:26.689 --> 04:28.612
Percy Muir was the oldest of the group.

04:28.632 --> 04:32.818
His education had stopped when he left school, after which he'd been a clerk, an actor, and a soldier.

04:33.203 --> 04:36.629
only taking up bookselling by chance when he was demobilised in 1919.

04:38.151 --> 04:58.266
How he became a partner and eventually owner of Elkin Matthews, that great name of the 90s, and then in the 20s and 30s, the most adventurous and scholarly of antiquarian booksellers, is a tale once told in the pages of the book collector and subsequently brought together in his autobiography, Minding My Own Business, which again is full of worthwhile lessons for our own time.

04:59.123 --> 05:06.257
By sheer application, he'd educated himself till he'd become a tower of strength, not only among English, but also the European book trade.

05:06.357 --> 05:11.247
Literature in all languages, fine printing, theatre and music, early industry and trade found him well equipped.

05:12.008 --> 05:20.946
And his tall figure, beautiful speaking voice, and peculiar hand-woven bow ties made him a striking figure.

05:21.179 --> 05:31.134
Almost unique among the English and American book trade at the time, apart from the expatriate part of it, he could speak French and German fluently.

05:31.154 --> 05:42.512
But perhaps his principal contribution to the book collector was not the admirable and copious articles and notes he provided up to a month or two before his lamented death ten years ago, but his friendship with Ian Fleming.

05:43.319 --> 05:54.370
Now, Ian Fleming's name will be very familiar to you as the author of the James Bond novels, whose spectacular popular success and exploitation has overlain the real quality of his early writing, notably Casino Royale.

05:55.471 --> 06:04.279
What you may not know is that Fleming was, and had been since just before the war, a book collector of very great determination and staggering originality.

06:04.339 --> 06:09.064
His subject matter was the books that demonstrated the progress of the human mind since 1800.

06:09.104 --> 06:11.706
Nobody else was in the field.

06:12.310 --> 06:19.423
The books were not then expensive, not even the origin of species, but they were hard to find.

06:20.626 --> 06:30.384
Fleming, working hard in naval intelligence during the war, and as foreign editor of Lord Kemsley's Sunday Times after the war, didn't have time to look for them himself and made Percy Muir his agent.

06:30.404 --> 06:35.854
This was ideal for Percy too, because the war had forced him to abandon London, had been bombed out.

06:36.712 --> 07:06.685
And choosing the subjects and the books while the way in many bleak hours during the war and after it, the more abstruse foreign items like Semmelweisle d'Etiologie, this is one of the rarest books in the world, the little pamphlet tracked on outbreak of purple fever in the 1860s in Vienna, which almost accidentally laid the entire foundations for the creation of immunology.

07:07.238 --> 07:17.612
Of all examples of how the printed word can transform human life is one of the most staggering.

07:17.632 --> 07:28.968
Anyway, picking up books like this were a splendid excuse to renew pre-war friendships in Italy and Germany for Percy, where he had a tremendous influence in hatching over the wounds of war.

07:28.988 --> 07:33.955
Fleming was ideally placed, as you can see, to rescue the book collector from its 1952

07:34.272 --> 07:40.061
And in that year, Lord Kemsley gave up books as suddenly as he'd taken them up.

07:41.003 --> 07:44.067
And the Brockmore Press was closed down, and the book collector would have followed.

07:44.107 --> 07:47.573
Sorry, it's 1953-4, the winter of 54.

07:47.593 --> 07:52.641
The Brockmore Press was closed down, and the book collector would have followed, and Fleming rescued it.

07:52.701 --> 08:00.533
He'd just begun to reap the rewards of the success of Casino Royale, and felt he could offer to buy the book collector from Lord Kemsley for Â£100, which he did.

08:01.711 --> 08:15.428
So it was a very anxious moment for the editorial board, which is now solely responsible for the journal's future, and they decided to protect it by asking one or two book-loving friends to act as guarantors by putting up some capital which would provide the reserves needed in an emergency.

08:16.129 --> 08:29.625
Several people responded, notably Mr. Paul Mellon, with great generosity, and the book collector was off again with, as I said, no visible change in editorial policy or physical appearance, except that it now had a new printer in James Shand of the Shenville Press.

08:30.500 --> 08:32.882
a firm distinguished for the quality of its printing.

08:33.943 --> 08:41.190
I suppose it was about now that I became a regular reader, and as I turned the pages now, I can still recapture the excitement that I felt when I first saw them.

08:41.210 --> 08:51.060
There was that marvellous series, Nixon's English Bookbindings, which has become now enshrined in a book and continued by his successor, Miriam Foote.

08:52.101 --> 08:57.786
There was my last, now recently dead, friend Julian Brown's English Literary Autographs.

08:57.826 --> 08:59.528
There was unfamiliar libraries.

09:00.115 --> 09:05.543
from Manchester to Los Angeles, from Kershaw in the west of Ireland, to Arevan in southern Soviet Georgia.

09:06.464 --> 09:13.794
Contemporary collectors described the libraries of most of the great collectors of the time, Robert Taylor, Bradley Martin, Albert Ehrman, Major Abbey.

09:14.355 --> 09:27.253
Well, a portrait of a bibliophile has ranged from Humphrey-Dougard Gloucester in the 15th century to Charles Spoilbosch de Gloucester, the collector of his great French contemporaries in the 19th century.

09:27.740 --> 09:41.754
And above all, there was uncollected authors in a series of invaluable author bibliographies, beginning with John Hayward's article, assisted by his old friend, the subject of the piece, on Raymond Chandler.

09:44.637 --> 09:52.805
And most of all, there was John's authoritative commentary, a feature that still continues, though in a slightly different form.

09:53.065 --> 09:55.688
It's now called news and comment, and it's rather longer.

09:57.490 --> 10:01.295
Well, what about the sort of feature articles in the Book Collector?

10:01.315 --> 10:04.719
Well, they all seem to me to deal with new and unfamiliar subjects.

10:04.799 --> 10:10.025
The first article on beta radiography ever appeared in the Book Collector.

10:11.146 --> 10:17.915
Graham Pollard's brilliant resurrection of Anglo-Saxon bookbindings by X-ray photography first appeared here.

10:18.595 --> 10:24.362
Here, too, the strange conduct of the Cathedral Library of Saragossa was first exposed.

10:24.382 --> 10:26.485
I noticed, incidentally, that Larry Wittenhouse

10:26.718 --> 10:33.008
I haven't read it yet, The Definitive Account of the Vinland Math in the current Yale Library Gazette.

10:33.749 --> 10:38.797
And I gather that he thinks he got Ferraioli out of prison when I expect he helped.

10:38.917 --> 10:50.616
But it was an article in the Book Collector, which was subsequently appeared in the Sunday Times, that caused the Spanish ambassador to be summoned to the Foreign Office and told him to get him out of the jug quickly.

10:51.642 --> 11:18.477
One article that peculiarly fascinates me was by a lady whom I've since lost touch with called Mary Walter at UCLA, who pieced together the astonishing story of this suppressed crypto-antisemitic version of Thomas Mann's Valsam and Blue, which was resurrected from waste sheets of the suppressed issue of the magazine in which it had appeared, which had been providently preserved for packing by the bookseller publisher.

11:19.199 --> 11:23.466
How much bibliography owes to the parsimonious habits of booksellers?

11:25.729 --> 11:27.272
Well, there's been other articles.

11:28.093 --> 11:32.079
Robert Bosper wrote a marvellous article on the red brick universities in England.

11:33.101 --> 11:37.547
There's been an article on the library of the church at Monterey.

11:37.567 --> 11:42.195
Harding's unique collection of song books, once in Chicago and now at the Bodleian Library, Oxford.

11:43.056 --> 11:47.603
On dirty books in England from 1660 to 1745, we did the first

11:48.443 --> 11:56.445
full-length description of the damage caused by the flood in Florence in 1967, and so on and so on.

11:58.653 --> 12:07.524
Well, I suppose it was natural once I got into business and work in London that I got involved into this vortex.

12:07.564 --> 12:22.163
The immediate cause was Stanley Morrison, the older and much admired friend of Carter Muir and Hayward, who invited me in 1959 to be his research assistant, thereby setting me off on a course which led finally to writing his biography, finishing his last great work called Politics and Script.

12:23.071 --> 12:51.660
I find myself doing odd reviews for the book collector, but what first caught John Hayward's attention was an article I wrote called The Aesthetic Investor's Guide to Current Literary Value, in which I attempted to prove that every author had a value, mathematical or financial, it didn't really matter which, that could be worked out by correlating the original price of his works, the current price, the number of copies printed, and the number of copies now surviving,

12:51.927 --> 12:57.535
multiplied by the number of lines accorded to the author in the Cambridge History of English Literature.

13:00.320 --> 13:01.842
John Maywood liked it.

13:02.443 --> 13:06.870
It sent up both the book trade and academic lit crit with impartial abandon.

13:06.910 --> 13:08.212
I read it again the other day.

13:08.272 --> 13:09.874
I still think it's quite too funny.

13:12.678 --> 13:17.125
Anyway, I soon became admitted to the terrors and delights of tea at Carlisle Mansions.

13:18.775 --> 13:21.619
John's conversation was ribald, erudite, and riveting.

13:21.980 --> 13:23.802
I learned much and began to be less afraid.

13:24.864 --> 13:32.435
I even took our eldest child, now doing her PhD at the Courthold, she was then about eight months old, and crawling.

13:32.675 --> 13:38.704
John fed her very sticky chocolate cake and watched with cheerful malice in the hope that she would spread it on the T.S.

13:38.724 --> 13:40.967
Eliot manuscripts on a convenient bottom shelf.

13:42.389 --> 13:44.192
What I did not realise...

13:44.510 --> 13:49.055
in those days was that John, immobile, had begun to become dependent on me.

13:50.076 --> 13:54.161
People used to say that he kept alive on willpower alone with his terrible disabilities.

13:54.481 --> 13:56.223
He felt that it was the activity of the mind.

13:57.064 --> 14:02.010
The endless curiosity about other people that forced his reluctant limbs to the little activity they could compass.

14:02.330 --> 14:04.733
He lived vicariously through the activity of others.

14:05.854 --> 14:13.723
In 1965, I remember, we'd had no holiday for a variety of reasons until October when we were about to snatch a bare week starting on a Friday.

14:14.362 --> 14:17.928
That day, John rang me up with some question about a review, which I couldn't follow.

14:17.988 --> 14:24.019
He had, by then, no muscular control of his mouth, and this was apt to prolong his very, very long telephone calls still further.

14:24.079 --> 14:27.104
In the end, I gave up, and I said, John, I'm off on holiday today.

14:27.124 --> 14:27.985
I've got nothing else to do.

14:28.005 --> 14:29.208
I'll come down and see you.

14:29.869 --> 14:32.032
So I went down to Chelsea, and we sorted out the problem.

14:32.113 --> 14:34.116
I still didn't quite see what the fuss was about.

14:34.136 --> 14:38.243
And as I was going to meet, he said, you will make sure everything is all right, won't you?

14:38.628 --> 14:40.411
I said, John, look, I'm going off on holiday.

14:40.432 --> 14:40.933
You'll be here.

14:40.973 --> 14:41.634
You can look after it.

14:41.654 --> 14:44.600
Yes, he said, but I want to be sure that you will if anything goes wrong.

14:45.622 --> 14:48.588
I was very puzzled by this and said, of course I will.

14:48.628 --> 14:50.571
Off I went on holiday, and that night he died.

14:51.934 --> 15:01.092
Three weeks later, I was at his memorial service in St Luke's Church, Chelsea, and a posse of hard-faced men, Muir, Carter, and Mumby, rounded me up after it.

15:01.544 --> 15:11.757
As I stood against the wall of the North Isle of church, I looked at them with their hats well pulled down, their hands in their overcoat pockets, and I realised that my hour had come.

15:11.777 --> 15:17.284
And with John's last words still echoing in my ears, I agreed to do my best to take his place.

15:17.764 --> 15:23.251
Well, 16 years later, no, God, 25 years later, we're still here.

15:23.391 --> 15:25.594
I still wonder at it.

15:26.030 --> 15:29.614
I was instantly plunged into a major financial crisis.

15:29.814 --> 15:33.098
Ian Fleming had died a few weeks before John.

15:33.699 --> 15:47.235
And the cumulative effect of inheritance tax on Fleming's estate, followed by inheritance tax on John's estate, swallowed up every single penny of the book collector's reserves.

15:47.255 --> 15:51.700
And we survived that, and we survived the death three years later of our printer, James Shandt.

15:52.692 --> 16:03.201
But the greatest of all losses came on the 29th of March 1976, with the death of the kindest and closest of friends to the book collector and its editor, John Carter.

16:04.762 --> 16:09.306
Jake, as many knew him, was as distinguished in person as he was in mind.

16:09.586 --> 16:22.277
A scholar of King's College, Cambridge, he was for many years manager of Scriblin's rare book department, and as such made a host of friends in this country, and with his Savannah-born wife, Ernestine, made more as an attachÃ© at the British Embassy in Washington.

16:22.443 --> 16:24.285
and later at Sotheby's.

16:24.305 --> 16:27.729
I dare say that some of you were as proud as I am to number him among their friends.

16:28.110 --> 16:51.117
He only made one enemy, Thomas James Wise, whose forgeries he exploded in the famous Enquiring to the Nature of Seven 19th century pamphlets, which was printed and published in 1934, and which was republished 50 years later and edited by me with an extra volume, which I'm very proud to have

16:51.518 --> 16:52.399
added to his memory.

16:53.421 --> 16:58.931
As an editor, he also co-opted me onto that great catalogue of all the world's greatest books, Printing in the Mind of Man.

16:58.951 --> 17:12.454
I sometimes think, as people mainly generally do, that if I had a penny for every pound that the book collector, the book selling trade, made out of Printing in the Mind of Man, I could have retired on the proceeds a long time ago.

17:13.435 --> 17:17.442
But John was actually a great classical scholar, Montay, and his

17:17.725 --> 17:21.670
critical talents in that direction displayed in his edition of Houseman's Priorities.

17:21.770 --> 17:22.911
It's a marvelous book.

17:22.931 --> 17:28.998
He was a writer of very great elegance himself, and the ABC for book collectors is a perennial reminder of his skill.

17:29.339 --> 17:34.905
Actually, I'm real fed up about that because I have a box which I must get down to someday.

17:35.466 --> 17:39.531
It contains 25 books on book collecting written in the last decade.

17:40.432 --> 17:43.395
And I want to do one of those consumer guides.

17:43.595 --> 17:52.125
through guys to book collectors, you know, full of elaborate graphics and graphs and things like that.

17:52.385 --> 17:53.166
Yes, I know.

17:53.326 --> 17:58.412
Well, take it from me that ABC for book collectors is way out in front and the rest is nowhere.

17:59.133 --> 18:03.718
The trouble is, of course, that it was a book that was meant for permanent revision.

18:03.738 --> 18:10.005
And those arch buffoons in Random House, when they took over Knopf, they forgot about this.

18:10.106 --> 18:13.129
And so they've gone on reprinting it unaltered.

18:13.565 --> 18:16.589
thereby souring the entire market for the rest of the world.

18:16.670 --> 18:21.477
And so there hasn't been a revised edition since the one that I did in 1980.

18:23.179 --> 18:24.862
Well, where do we stand now?

18:25.743 --> 18:29.529
We're much where we were 30 years ago.

18:29.589 --> 18:33.895
The Book Collector's got about 2,000 subscribers, just under half of them in this country.

18:35.057 --> 18:41.867
Its contributors are also drawn pretty equally from Britain and the USA and a few from elsewhere.

18:42.505 --> 18:45.829
I like to think of its registered office, so to speak, in Atlantis.

18:47.011 --> 18:57.124
And the leader with which each issue begins, which I usually write myself about some topic or book of current interest, it's firmly aimed at both sides of the Atlantic.

18:57.284 --> 18:58.206
It's always anonymous.

18:59.067 --> 19:04.915
I always sort of taskably assume that everybody knows that anything that doesn't have somebody else's name in it is written by me.

19:05.615 --> 19:10.622
I'm thankful to say that those awful people, the people who make a living by compiling

19:10.822 --> 19:37.352
anthologies called the year's best work in this that and the other have never conned on to this fact so I do not get a series of letters saying will you please assign the copy into our article on so and so which affects other people then come the articles which I've talked to you about then there's news and comment which has all the latest news on books and libraries and exhibitions book sales and catalogues book collectors

19:37.754 --> 19:40.818
booksellers and librarians, the whole world of old and rare books.

19:40.878 --> 19:42.580
It's written by several hands, in fact.

19:43.161 --> 19:49.870
And it's topical, and I hope careful, and sometimes funny, and only scandalous if I know that the scandal is true.

19:51.512 --> 20:04.369
After that, there's bibliographical notes and queries, an invaluable agony column for those who've got some small but important discovery they want to get off their chest, or want to run down some missing manuscript or edition, or have found some other bibliographical conundrum.

20:04.872 --> 20:08.756
I wish that more people took advantage of this, actually.

20:08.776 --> 20:13.380
It used to be much longer, and for some reason I can't explain.

20:13.420 --> 20:16.823
It seems to me that it still serves the same useful purpose.

20:16.843 --> 20:22.629
It's a marvellous way of running down the manuscript that was last seen in the Lothian sale in 1937, and where is it now?

20:23.149 --> 20:33.799
And people don't use it, so if any of you have got some little problem that you think somebody else in the world, jot it down on a piece of paper, send it into the book collector, and we'll publish it.

20:35.348 --> 20:41.654
After that come the book reviews, which are occasionally dull, though I try to stop that.

20:41.674 --> 20:45.098
They're usually authoritative, and sometimes, again, they're very funny.

20:46.259 --> 20:47.280
That makes up the text.

20:47.380 --> 20:50.163
But there's one other very important component, the advertisements.

20:51.144 --> 20:52.945
We take great personal pride in these.

20:52.985 --> 21:00.012
We see to the design and presentation and try and see that they're all equally elegant.

21:00.113 --> 21:02.655
Every now and again, somebody sends us what they call a mechanical.

21:03.445 --> 21:09.594
which usually lives up to its name, but so long as we can do the setting ourselves, they really look rather nice.

21:09.614 --> 21:14.521
And I like to think of this as a kind of directory of all the best booksellers in Britain, the USA, and Europe.

21:16.384 --> 21:33.148
There have been, it's rather sad that the old friends, so many of them, Mike Papantonio, John Fleming, Krauss, LDF, Peter Murray Hill, the people who set us off in life, have died, and some of their

21:34.124 --> 21:36.771
I can't call them equals.

21:36.831 --> 21:40.360
I've been a little slow to pick up what I see as beauty.

21:42.606 --> 21:44.130
I was thinking of Cavallity.

21:44.972 --> 21:45.855
Yes, Cavallity.

21:45.975 --> 21:50.226
Cavallity is our motto too, friend.

21:50.594 --> 21:55.326
I think they get a very good return for it.

21:55.366 --> 22:03.727
I will tell you, there was one bookseller in New York who once said that he thought he'd better cancel his full page advertisement.

22:03.747 --> 22:08.198
I said, well, let's still think it over because he really is very sorry to lose you.

22:09.427 --> 22:13.070
Ten days later he rang up and he said, could you still put my ad back in again?

22:13.090 --> 22:15.252
I said, well, yes, it hasn't got the press yet.

22:15.272 --> 22:16.513
He said, well, I wish you would.

22:16.553 --> 22:23.559
He said, somebody came into the shop just after I wrote that letter and asked for, said he'd read a copy of the book collection and could he have my last catalogue?

22:23.579 --> 22:27.162
And I said, I gave him one and didn't expect to see him or hear any more about it.

22:27.602 --> 22:32.747
Ten days later he came back and bought a $35,000 book out of the catalogue.

22:33.968 --> 22:39.012
Advertising pay!

22:39.228 --> 22:43.292
In the old days, of course, we were still printed by letterpress.

22:43.772 --> 22:46.415
And I told you I'd say something about the covers.

22:46.435 --> 22:58.446
And in those days, the covers were all printed on different colored paper stock, each with a very elegant border of colored printers' flowers surrounding the contents.

22:58.466 --> 23:06.113
And this design was, I'm ashamed to say, plagiarized by so many American bibliographical library journals.

23:06.582 --> 23:09.184
that I decided with much regret to give it up.

23:09.825 --> 23:22.416
And we now use a series of different early title page borders, again with, I think, distinctive and cheerful colours, which we've tried to maintain ever since.

23:23.578 --> 23:25.319
Well, here we are in 1989.

23:25.359 --> 23:30.083
I shall have celebrated my Silver Jubilee next year if I live so long.

23:30.944 --> 23:34.007
Book collectors now have become a closely studied species.

23:34.780 --> 23:41.510
rarely found outside wildlife parks like book fairs or reservations like libraries.

23:42.011 --> 23:43.413
But somehow they survive.

23:43.873 --> 23:55.330
And indeed, they're showing a new vitality these days which suggests that all the rules of ecology are being somehow contravened.

23:55.350 --> 23:57.233
On the whole, the book collector still survives.

23:57.273 --> 24:03.302
A new generation of subscribers and contributors is beginning to enjoy it, I think, and I think to share in

24:03.704 --> 24:12.899
a distinctive and even admirable tradition, one that brings individuals and institutions, collectors, booksellers and librarians a bit closer together.

24:12.940 --> 24:14.743
That's what he's really there for, you know.

24:14.803 --> 24:19.651
There's no other journal that actually tries to serve all those communities.

24:19.731 --> 24:29.307
There's trade journals, there's library journals, there's scholarly journals, but we're the only one that tries to sit and see it through all those points of view.

24:30.417 --> 24:39.131
And I can't see myself, really, as any more than a link in a chain, which I hope will go on for a long, long time after I have seen it.

24:39.151 --> 24:49.367
Thank you very much for listening to me.

24:49.447 --> 24:57.960
Any brickbats, comments, and queries will be filled as best I can with my mouthful.

24:58.261 --> 25:01.604
What became of Ian Fleming's collection?

25:01.845 --> 25:03.526
What became of Ian Fleming's collection?

25:04.307 --> 25:08.091
The Lilly Library.

25:08.131 --> 25:10.954
What was the answer?

25:12.315 --> 25:17.340
It's gone to the Lilly Library in IU.

25:17.360 --> 25:19.682
That must be a good story.

25:21.344 --> 25:25.027
That wouldn't be one of the invitations for it.

25:25.047 --> 25:27.610
Oh no, I couldn't say such a thing.

25:33.918 --> 25:49.758
Well, you touched on a little question which I approach with a certain delicacy.

25:50.178 --> 25:57.828
There is, in Iowa City, a thing called, I think, the U.S.

25:57.848 --> 26:02.153
Military Hospital.

26:03.500 --> 26:04.741
medical library.

26:07.684 --> 26:11.908
Why you should need to subscribe to the book collector, I simply can't imagine.

26:11.928 --> 26:19.575
Well, no, I think part of it would defeat a casual external inspection, shall we say.

26:19.595 --> 26:30.285
There are other great libraries which don't subscribe, but I do notice that the librarian, I happen to know by name, subscribes to it.

26:30.305 --> 26:32.747
The main fact of the matter is that, you know,

26:33.436 --> 26:36.178
Do you have a differential rate for an institution?

26:36.198 --> 26:37.039
We do not, no.

26:37.320 --> 26:40.202
No, we get the same subscription for everybody.

26:41.243 --> 26:46.708
And actually, it's dirt cheap.

26:48.590 --> 26:51.572
I keep on being, how much is it?

26:53.594 --> 26:57.578
Yearly subscription rates, 28.

26:57.978 --> 27:00.180
Well, I suppose that's $28.

27:00.200 --> 27:02.262
That's where I'm allowing them.

27:03.237 --> 27:04.198
Oh, no, that's a different thing.

27:04.218 --> 27:05.780
That's called Libraries and Culture.

27:05.881 --> 27:08.624
I'm sorry, that's not... How much is In Corsica?

27:08.684 --> 27:11.688
Oh, well, In Corsica, you have to belong to society, I don't know.

27:11.728 --> 27:18.698
We have $40 a year, and I reckon that probably that's for our... You get 500 pages for $40.

27:19.539 --> 27:20.981
You couldn't do that with most books.

27:21.882 --> 27:31.455
No, the fact of the matter is that...

27:33.933 --> 27:41.903
In terms of actually what it says, name institutions of three-eighths, and names of five-eighths.

27:43.144 --> 27:53.297
But I know that some of the individuals are really libraries in disguise, and I know darn well that the number of libraries are really mortgaged.

27:53.858 --> 28:01.527
Well, I'm counting booksellers as individuals for the purpose of this.

28:02.047 --> 28:13.599
Of course, some booksellers have multiple subscriptions from which I know that there are other people whom I don't know about who will habitually buy their copy from forages or not.

28:13.739 --> 28:26.191
We did an analysis of, since many of our members would get our proceedings for free, and we were wondering what in fact they were getting their copies.

28:26.211 --> 28:29.995
We did an analysis last year and matching their

28:31.561 --> 28:59.982
very little um uh evidence to make that necessarily that is including there are a few um institutions where they were not uh

29:00.198 --> 29:19.264
I mean, the people who actually are like Shaw in my really good books are the not inconsiderable number of big libraries who have two subscriptions, one to go on the shelf and one to circulate the staff.

29:19.284 --> 29:22.408
And that always flatters and pleases me very much indeed.

29:26.236 --> 29:31.244
Nicholas, I didn't get the name of the founder of the, what was it, the book, the handbook?

29:31.264 --> 29:32.647
Reginald Horrocks.

29:32.667 --> 29:33.128
Horrocks.

29:33.568 --> 29:34.510
H-O-R-R-O-X.

29:34.650 --> 29:36.914
Oh, okay.

29:36.934 --> 29:38.296
What was his background?

29:39.618 --> 29:40.280
Well, I don't know.

29:40.680 --> 29:41.301
I suppose.

29:41.682 --> 29:49.375
I mean, he only died within the last decade, actually.

29:49.395 --> 29:49.896
I suppose.

29:50.857 --> 29:51.298
I mean,

29:51.515 --> 29:55.119
I think he would have just started as a bookseller before the war.

29:55.139 --> 30:02.006
What he did in the war I don't know, but he started up the book handbook in the immediate aftermath of the war.

30:02.026 --> 30:15.160
And then he dropped it in certain places I really don't know, and went off and was a bookseller in Bath, and for years and years she was one of those

30:15.342 --> 30:31.599
curiating booksellers who used to issue catalogs sporadically with at least three really good books, very cheap, and no telephone number.

30:32.060 --> 30:32.761
John Hayward.

30:35.884 --> 30:39.628
This will show you the advantages of immobility.
