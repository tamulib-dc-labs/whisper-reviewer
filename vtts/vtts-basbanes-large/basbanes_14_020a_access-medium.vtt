00:04.283 --> 00:14.041
Well, I was in a position to be custodian for 10 years as the director of the National Museum Library.

00:14.141 --> 00:19.731
It opened in 1888.

00:19.892 --> 00:25.482
It has a magnificent Hebrew.

00:25.917 --> 00:29.662
Spanish, Bosnian manuscript called Sarajevo Haggadah.

00:29.702 --> 00:34.408
All these attributes are important.

00:34.428 --> 00:38.734
It's written in Hebrew, it's fully illustrated in Haggadah.

00:38.754 --> 00:42.238
As of the Haggadah, 1360.

00:43.540 --> 00:49.528
It was bought in Bosnia probably by the exile, by the Jews exile in Spain.

00:49.930 --> 00:51.211
About when, would you say?

00:52.012 --> 01:05.387
Well, it circulated certainly for two last centuries, somewhere between Bosnia and Croatia, where there's a lot of Jews in their settlements.

01:05.407 --> 01:18.402
And finally there was a library, one of the greatest libraries, I mean the only library of that time, the library of the museum.

01:18.888 --> 01:21.151
Because most of our manuscripts, that's the point.

01:21.171 --> 01:26.897
Because most of the original Bosnian medieval manuscripts are somewhere else in Spain, somewhere else.

01:27.758 --> 01:37.429
I am spreading the lie that this is a Bosnian manuscript.

01:37.449 --> 01:42.094
Although I am fully aware that it is from Spain, that it belongs to the Jewish tradition,

01:42.749 --> 01:48.536
And that is accidental in Sarajevo because the refugees took the book.

01:48.556 --> 01:56.204
So what you're suggesting is an ecumenical context.

01:56.224 --> 01:57.946
That's the whole point.

01:58.206 --> 01:58.967
It's a good book.

01:59.027 --> 02:00.309
That book had held a genie.

02:01.030 --> 02:04.994
Enclosed little metal casket.

02:06.235 --> 02:10.360
And every time you open the book, the genie did a good thing.

02:10.593 --> 02:17.162
The good thing about Chi is that he is protecting not only the book, but you and all the people involved.

02:17.202 --> 02:21.348
That is so, I'm obsessed with this book on one hand.

02:21.408 --> 02:27.336
On the other hand, you cannot predict what will happen next.

02:28.458 --> 02:37.410
So practically we have a crisis with Haggara during this war because someone, Tom Schenker, did an article in the New York Republic,

02:37.998 --> 02:39.960
The New Republic?

02:40.000 --> 02:53.978
The New Republic, February 17, 1995, stating that the Bosnian Muslim governments sold the Haggadah, the price of the Haggadah, for one million dollars in order to buy the weapons.

02:54.739 --> 02:55.500
Oh, that's horrible.

02:55.780 --> 03:01.006
That's totally BS, as we say, too, right?

03:01.026 --> 03:05.592
Talks about BSes, don't you?

03:06.213 --> 03:09.798
I was so furious at the moment.

03:09.878 --> 03:12.202
I'm sorry, just a second.

03:13.023 --> 03:15.306
Let us know what your plans are.

03:15.486 --> 03:19.812
Okay, I'm sorry.

03:22.476 --> 03:29.366
You said something about the... The problem is, I will kill him on the spot, but he's not in the city.

03:29.907 --> 03:32.891
He was in New York at that time.

03:33.552 --> 03:35.595
I have a phone call from William May.

03:35.828 --> 03:49.368
the guy that published that article in New Combat, in 9 o'clock morning, my time, meaning 3 o'clock in the night, your time, stating, I am sending you the email because my phone rings all the time.

03:49.968 --> 03:58.481
All the peoples are inquiring and telling me that I am a liar, that I am spreading the news, that I met in Sarajevo, you who are the custodian of the data.

03:59.522 --> 04:01.064
For Christ's sake, what is happening?

04:02.406 --> 04:04.890
So he said, after he returned,

04:05.090 --> 04:14.283
home, he sat for two hours, retyping the article and sending me via email and asking me to respond to the letter of the editor.

04:14.424 --> 04:19.231
I did my job and respond, unfortunately, they didn't publish it.

04:19.351 --> 04:31.789
But we have to present the Haggadah in a Passover, that was a blasphemy, you know, presenting the book, that is family book in the synagogue, just to show the world

04:32.343 --> 04:33.424
But we didn't sell it.

04:33.544 --> 04:37.269
I mean, it was the most beautiful way, just to show it on the CNN.

04:37.930 --> 04:41.554
At the time I was in Slovenia, totally alone.

04:41.854 --> 04:43.436
This is Passover, no one works.

04:44.077 --> 04:44.758
What year is this?

04:45.198 --> 04:46.400
In 1995.

04:46.760 --> 04:47.901
This is just last year.

04:48.002 --> 04:50.304
Yeah, 1995.

04:53.068 --> 04:59.335
And I was there watching the CNN pouring in a hotel room.

04:59.415 --> 05:00.156
And then it was

05:00.423 --> 05:11.675
Oklahoma City, Palm being special, and then as small pieces, Paso Vomirko in Sarajevo, and after the O.J.

05:11.695 --> 05:13.997
Simpson trial, I don't know, of course.

05:14.057 --> 05:15.299
And more O.J.

05:15.359 --> 05:16.140
Simpson trial.

05:16.220 --> 05:16.600
And more O.J.

05:16.620 --> 05:17.000
Simpson trial.

05:17.661 --> 05:18.442
So we did it.

05:18.462 --> 05:26.110
But I find it insulting for the government, and both for me, if someone tells me that I will send the most precious volume of my collections.

05:26.410 --> 05:30.174
We've got no price at all.

05:30.194 --> 05:32.996
Marion, could we... Marion.

05:34.498 --> 05:36.440
Marion, let's pick my stuff and go.

05:36.480 --> 05:37.941
Okay, let's go, come on.

05:38.121 --> 05:38.181
Hi.

05:40.724 --> 05:46.369
So... So we presented to the world that you didn't sell.

05:46.409 --> 05:49.212
You know, this is a humiliating thing to happen.

05:49.992 --> 05:53.476
Why would it be suggested that you sell it after all you went through to save it?

05:54.737 --> 05:55.978
It's outrageous, isn't it?

05:56.093 --> 05:58.496
Outrageous.

05:58.556 --> 06:02.019
I never chose the smiling because my favorite quote, dark over the dead.

06:03.341 --> 06:05.683
And why do you suppose that story was made up?

06:05.823 --> 06:07.165
I mean, what was the purpose to that?

06:07.205 --> 06:11.950
Well, I spent several months in discussing with myself.

06:13.311 --> 06:16.435
Precisely that same reason, same question.

06:16.575 --> 06:19.418
Same question.

06:19.735 --> 06:32.550
asking the same question for myself, and after reviewing the situation and the circumstances and everything, what had happened, I wasn't so angry at Tom Shanker.

06:32.950 --> 06:33.992
Now, who's Tom Shanker?

06:34.012 --> 06:34.893
Is he an American?

06:34.913 --> 06:38.557
Yes, he's an American figure in general, I think.

06:40.399 --> 06:48.088
Because it clearly shows that someone knows that Vergara exists, and definitely because of the communication breakdown,

06:48.490 --> 06:57.462
And because of a lot of rumors, information, and mal-information, these things can be put in public.

06:57.482 --> 07:06.714
So practically he raised the issue on very, you know, journalists like to do these things.

07:06.734 --> 07:12.181
Do we know where we're going right away?

07:12.461 --> 07:17.147
The only thing about Dan Schoenke that he knows, I think he's a Jew.

07:17.127 --> 07:19.170
I'm not sure.

07:19.230 --> 07:22.695
He knows about Haggara and definitely raises questions.

07:23.195 --> 07:30.025
But he did it on the way as young reporters do to make a sensation.

07:30.225 --> 07:32.468
I'm shocked.

07:32.488 --> 07:33.650
Where is he based?

07:34.250 --> 07:35.412
I think so in New York.

07:35.652 --> 07:37.034
I think I'll find him.

07:37.054 --> 07:37.755
I'm very curious.

07:37.815 --> 07:41.320
This is kind of a question I'd be pleased to ask him.

07:41.340 --> 07:42.702
Don't mention my name.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.666
I've been doing this for a lot of years.

07:45.646 --> 07:48.229
Your email address.

07:48.469 --> 08:06.307
Are we invited in this?

08:06.907 --> 08:09.850
This is comfortable.

08:11.172 --> 08:11.552
Great.

08:19.514 --> 08:43.767
I have to go to, you are going to go straight.

08:43.983 --> 08:47.972
And then Nick will take you back.

08:48.012 --> 08:50.658
Mary, tell me where you want me to take you.

08:50.838 --> 08:56.250
Well, he'll have to take you back.

08:58.134 --> 08:58.515
Oh, that's easy.

08:58.647 --> 09:26.764
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

09:27.115 --> 09:57.004
Thank you very much.

09:57.322 --> 10:14.838
Were you filming it?

10:16.880 --> 10:27.210
No, I don't think it's hard to be worried.

10:27.646 --> 10:50.346
I'd like to send you a copy of my book, so you can see what I've done about my first book.

10:52.908 --> 11:06.175
I think we're open.

11:06.627 --> 11:28.245
No, no, no.

11:28.265 --> 11:28.466
Thank you.

11:28.486 --> 11:28.686
Thank you.

11:28.953 --> 11:46.219
How long were you at the Holy Cross?

11:46.199 --> 12:08.967
Uh, actually, there's some of that, uh, two days ago, we had a community.

12:08.987 --> 12:09.969
And I was wondering if we were to do that.

12:09.989 --> 12:10.269
Is that right?

12:10.289 --> 12:10.569
Is that right?

12:10.589 --> 12:10.870
Is that right?

12:10.890 --> 12:11.170
Is that right?

12:11.190 --> 12:11.470
Is that right?

12:11.490 --> 12:11.771
Is that right?

12:11.791 --> 12:12.071
Is that right?

12:12.091 --> 12:12.372
Is that right?

12:12.392 --> 12:12.672
Is that right?

12:12.692 --> 12:12.972
Is that right?

12:12.992 --> 12:13.273
Is that right?

12:13.293 --> 12:13.573
Is that right?

12:13.553 --> 12:36.709
I used to read a book editor for the paper.

12:36.689 --> 12:54.327
to write this book.

12:54.347 --> 12:57.991
And I can't even know it.

12:58.011 --> 12:59.713
I'm going to try to do two more books.

12:59.733 --> 13:00.434
This was another book I read about.

13:00.454 --> 13:00.994
I'm going to get astounded.

13:01.014 --> 13:02.436
I read this book, 400 copies, which, well, they haven't sold out to me.

13:02.456 --> 13:04.118
They went into a specific printing store, but I want to get out for $15 in a place.

13:04.138 --> 13:04.418
It's just $15.

13:04.617 --> 13:20.854
It's a nice story.

13:20.834 --> 13:38.058
Take it up in here.

13:38.398 --> 13:47.871
Take it up in here.

13:47.851 --> 14:01.774
We have to coordinate our vehicles.

14:01.974 --> 14:07.243
Alan basically rescue.

14:07.628 --> 14:16.899
Yeah, and he came forward and said, this book is worth it.

14:16.959 --> 14:23.827
He called me and said, I'm going to publish it, and he's worth it.

14:23.927 --> 14:27.231
He said, you've got to tell me one thing.

14:27.251 --> 14:29.533
I said, what's wrong with this?

14:29.553 --> 14:30.494
I said, nobody ever told him.

14:30.514 --> 14:34.559
I'll go out in a second.

14:34.579 --> 14:35.981
This is what we're on the cover stuff.

14:36.001 --> 14:37.062
Yeah, this is what we do.

14:37.835 --> 14:51.440
Thank you.

14:54.706 --> 14:59.455
Thank you.

15:00.160 --> 15:13.541
Can anybody wait for a moment?

15:14.322 --> 15:23.316
I have to walk on it all.

15:23.819 --> 15:28.244
about a single book, about not just the content.

15:28.284 --> 15:43.160
The content is, of course, what a book is all about, but it may well be that I don't want to do a little too little book as a cautionary tale, kind of, you know, with illustration.

15:43.200 --> 15:44.261
I mean, we'll talk about it.

15:44.361 --> 15:46.023
Maybe it's something that's very interesting.

15:47.084 --> 15:48.105
And so when I

15:48.963 --> 15:54.511
go to the story and my actor told Tom Shanker, will I kill him and how will I kill him?

15:55.913 --> 16:01.802
I finally realized that I'm no longer angry on this guy because, yes, there are people who care.

16:02.182 --> 16:04.325
There are people who know about Aghara.

16:04.746 --> 16:13.298
And I simply understand his question as a question that will issue... I mean, every Jew will ask you this question.

16:13.579 --> 16:14.360
You know how I'm done.

16:15.542 --> 16:16.523
Unfortunately,

16:16.958 --> 16:20.642
It was done on the way as the news are produced in Pasadena.

16:20.722 --> 16:44.524
Everything must be covered with blood or totally described as a radical fundamentalistic, regardless of who is provoking the radicalism, chief rabbi or the chief prayer in a Muslim mosque or whatever.

16:44.544 --> 16:45.345
So what we do

16:45.933 --> 16:46.734
This is what we do.

16:46.754 --> 16:48.377
We show it to the Passover.

16:48.397 --> 16:54.388
It was something that was noticeable in the international press.

16:55.089 --> 17:02.382
Chicago Tribune issued an article on the front page stating that Passover is the arrival of the Times.

17:02.602 --> 17:04.565
Do you know when this was, the Chicago story?

17:05.126 --> 17:08.312
Last year again, in 1995?

17:08.782 --> 17:10.785
In fact, I have all these articles.

17:11.186 --> 17:12.849
I have the clippings of all these articles.

17:12.869 --> 17:13.550
They're at home.

17:13.911 --> 17:14.251
Yeah.

17:14.271 --> 17:17.597
You can send these to me when I have copies?

17:17.677 --> 17:18.298
Yes, I can.

17:18.318 --> 17:19.600
I can send you the copies.

17:19.640 --> 17:21.504
You can just give me the dates and I'll get them here.

17:21.944 --> 17:24.148
First, I will send you the bibliography.

17:24.168 --> 17:25.430
I have it in my computer.

17:25.731 --> 17:26.492
That's wonderful.

17:26.933 --> 17:29.597
That's all I need.

17:29.617 --> 17:32.983
And then the Roger Cohen article appears in the New York Times.

17:33.773 --> 17:53.131
And then in Times Magazine someone wrote a magnificent piece, but what hurts me in that particular piece in Times was Agira after the title stating a famous Jewish manuscript was returned, returned to the... To the white pole owner or whatever.

17:54.012 --> 17:56.274
To the Jewish community.

17:56.354 --> 18:02.380
I will never use the word return, like it is stolen or taken away.

18:02.714 --> 18:04.015
So that's my objection.

18:04.035 --> 18:07.739
But the total altitude of that particular piece is magnificent.

18:07.759 --> 18:09.761
I also have a... This was the New York Times Magazine?

18:10.682 --> 18:11.744
Yes.

18:12.644 --> 18:14.526
The magazine, the Sunday Magazine.

18:14.707 --> 18:15.407
Yeah, okay, good.

18:15.427 --> 18:17.890
There's a lot of stuff I have to research here then.

18:17.910 --> 18:20.192
But you say you have all these citations in your computer.

18:20.613 --> 18:21.714
I have all the list.

18:22.134 --> 18:29.262
And that they print practically the same story appeared in some Atlanta journal and, I don't know,

18:29.782 --> 18:33.949
So what are we doing?

18:44.408 --> 18:45.850
I'm just...

18:46.268 --> 18:49.071
pleased to do a public driving camera.

18:49.111 --> 18:50.492
What would be the best way to show you?

18:50.512 --> 18:52.954
He said you might be able to connect me to somebody in Zagreb.

18:52.974 --> 18:53.815
In Zagreb, yes.

18:53.835 --> 19:14.875
Ten years ago, there was a big scandal of the guys smuggling books from the National and University Library in Zagreb, practically stealing the books in a very specific way by buying a drink, a Spritzer, to the local guys who...

19:15.850 --> 19:19.074
You know the stuff of the library who puts the books in the shelves.

19:19.114 --> 19:20.055
They're not librarians.

19:20.375 --> 19:22.938
They're not curators either.

19:23.279 --> 19:27.003
They're custodians or whatever the heck they are or something like that.

19:27.083 --> 19:29.066
The lowest level of librarians.

19:29.106 --> 19:30.928
Shelvers, we call them.

19:30.968 --> 19:31.529
Shelvers.

19:31.549 --> 19:37.135
So he bought from them a priceless book, a very rare book.

19:37.556 --> 19:40.900
From the Trezor, they call it Trezor.

19:40.920 --> 19:42.702
The Trezor Safe Deposit Boxes.

19:43.087 --> 19:58.108
to the restricted area special collections with just a spritzer

19:58.088 --> 20:00.151
Can I get you a beer?

20:00.331 --> 20:03.556
A glass of wine.

20:03.576 --> 20:05.438
A glass of wine.

20:05.638 --> 20:12.127
He was stealing the books from the guy from the shelves by buying them a drink.

20:12.147 --> 20:14.891
Half water, half cheap wine.

20:14.911 --> 20:16.313
And he did it constantly.

20:16.634 --> 20:24.805
And the lady, a librarian, noticed that something is happening because of her invoices that she was putting was returned like...

20:24.785 --> 20:27.349
Book is on reading.

20:27.369 --> 20:30.154
But it's a special collection.

20:30.174 --> 20:32.097
She cannot trace.

20:32.117 --> 20:33.900
Who the fuck is reading these things?

20:33.920 --> 20:38.087
Because she asks daily and days and days.

20:38.107 --> 20:42.555
And always, always the stamp on the receipt occupied.

20:43.957 --> 20:44.438
I mean, out.

20:44.458 --> 20:45.780
Out on the reading.

20:46.503 --> 20:53.813
And she tried to figure out what is happening and realized that someone is picking up the priceless.

20:55.536 --> 21:04.208
The priceless books, I mean, it was not any book to the count.

21:04.228 --> 21:09.355
These are the books that were carefully selected.

21:10.043 --> 21:26.027
So he was getting them for somebody who knew what he wanted.

21:26.048 --> 21:26.148
Yeah.

21:26.168 --> 21:28.591
The problem is the following.

21:28.611 --> 21:33.719
She informed the director, this is part of the story that I wrote, the director of the library, and she did not respond.

21:33.739 --> 21:35.302
I mean, as a director, to start up an internal investigation or whatsoever.

21:35.322 --> 21:36.844
And there are books appearing on the black market in Zagreb, in Belgrade,

21:37.347 --> 21:49.241
with a stamp, not of the National University Library, it is a collection of Zagreb bishops' outfits.

21:49.402 --> 21:57.051
Because that, it's an agreement that they will keep the stuff for them.

21:57.071 --> 22:00.435
And finally when this affair broke up and the guy was in jeopardy,

22:00.415 --> 22:11.231
The set-up, he made all the arrangements, the set-up of fire internationally.

22:11.371 --> 22:19.723
Five minutes before he makes the match, he was arrested.

22:19.703 --> 22:31.025
The problem with this guy was in his nature, I mean, he's a guy who was a diabolic person, they have his diary on all these things, but he did it on purpose.

22:31.045 --> 22:32.168
Was there a trial?

22:32.188 --> 22:33.590
Yes, there was a trial.

22:33.610 --> 22:41.526
There is a magnificent four-hour special produced by a radio television of Zagreb.

22:42.029 --> 22:49.498
which describes in details what had happened, the trial, the aftermath, everything.

22:49.518 --> 22:50.400
How it all began.

22:50.580 --> 22:51.841
What did they call it?

22:51.922 --> 22:55.386
Did it have a name for it, like Watergate?

22:55.406 --> 23:00.552
No, it is a pair called... Alexander Miles, it's the name of the guy.

23:00.833 --> 23:05.859
They call it the father or something like that.

23:05.879 --> 23:08.863
The father of this person is... One of the famous...

23:08.843 --> 23:18.594
a famous freelance reporter and journalist.

23:19.375 --> 23:22.238
Very respectable one.

23:22.839 --> 23:28.105
And also this film includes the testimonies of his lawyer who defend him on the trial.

23:28.125 --> 23:33.551
And all the aftermath of what happened after.

23:33.571 --> 23:35.273
It is magnificent.

23:35.253 --> 23:48.666
There is also in that film, which I think you can easily, somehow, if you have a connection with Zara, have a coffee on video.

23:48.686 --> 23:52.114
In that film, there is a special story, a special attention to the lady.

23:52.094 --> 24:05.942
who first noticed these things.

24:05.963 --> 24:06.464
And alarmed the director.

24:06.484 --> 24:07.846
And I think that she's still working in National University Library.

24:07.866 --> 24:09.630
And I think she's the key person if she's still working, if she's still working, because

24:09.610 --> 24:18.362
She was the only responsible librarian at a particular point.

24:18.382 --> 24:25.052
Well, the other people were probably getting something, right?

24:25.172 --> 24:25.452
What?

24:25.472 --> 24:27.816
The other people were probably getting something.

24:28.336 --> 24:30.059
Maybe they were involved in the scheme?

24:30.079 --> 24:30.179
No?

24:30.199 --> 24:31.040
The film does not answer these questions.

24:31.060 --> 24:31.561
What was the trial?

24:31.581 --> 24:32.542
What was the good part of the story?

24:32.562 --> 24:33.103
We got him, you were still.

24:33.083 --> 24:47.378
So virtually you have everything.

24:47.978 --> 24:52.803
You have TV cover, TV special dedicated to that particular point.

24:52.824 --> 24:54.685
You have a trial and all the records of the trial, if accessible.

24:54.705 --> 24:56.027
You have a lawyer who lives in Zagreb who is defending.

24:56.047 --> 24:58.129
You have a guy rotting in the jail or he was released.

24:58.109 --> 25:04.556
And you have a librarian who will tell you the story of how it all started.

25:04.576 --> 25:06.838
I mean, you have everything.

25:06.918 --> 25:07.999
Let me try you explaining.

25:08.080 --> 25:14.847
Now, was the motive he agreed to sell the books, or did somebody just want to own it?

25:14.867 --> 25:21.754
From the point of view of the lawyer who defended him, he was a person with the trouble...

25:21.734 --> 25:39.194
Troubled childhood, probably obsessed with 666 model and some kind of weird stuff developed in the hand, because developed in the mind.

25:39.214 --> 25:46.122
There is an interview with a girl that she was walking, and roommates and classmates, you know, very particular person.

25:46.102 --> 25:53.223
He did it for some reasons.

25:53.243 --> 26:00.685
His lawyer basically said that he did it because he had a troubled childhood.

26:01.120 --> 26:14.198
But the amazing thing is that he did it so professionally in terms of his feeling and so brilliantly professionally in terms of picking up the particular books.

26:14.218 --> 26:15.821
But did they just swear the records?

26:15.901 --> 26:19.025
I mean, do they know what was taken?

26:19.045 --> 26:25.474
Yeah, they know what has been taken because they trace all the things because in his diary there are

26:25.454 --> 26:32.469
There are the addresses of all the antique shops in Austria.

26:32.589 --> 26:40.826
You know, all the peoples involved that take day witnesses in front of the court.

26:41.267 --> 26:44.273
For example, the antiquariats in Austria.

26:44.253 --> 27:11.239
My largest concern, of course, is the systematic destruction of your national library and the whole record of your... Yeah, maybe we can talk a little bit about it out in the pile when we don't have all this.

27:11.506 --> 27:26.473
But I mean, this will also be interesting to Cynthia.

27:26.493 --> 27:29.779
The problem is that I still do not believe that the library is gone.

27:29.799 --> 27:31.742
Because, you know, because the level of my...

27:31.722 --> 27:49.352
The level of my self-confidence is rather low.

27:49.372 --> 27:52.398
I still don't believe that the burning of the library is close if you don't mind.

27:52.418 --> 27:54.161
I still don't think that the burning of the library really happened.

27:54.181 --> 27:56.785
You know what, because I do not have the right answer why they did it.

27:56.765 --> 27:59.489
You still don't gather by yourself.

27:59.509 --> 28:03.055
Because... I think the answer is pretty simple, though.

28:03.075 --> 28:05.199
They were just trying to destroy people.

28:05.219 --> 28:07.663
You destroy people, you destroy... Yes, but you know, this is a national library.

28:07.683 --> 28:09.205
It's got the holding.

28:09.225 --> 28:20.724
The origin of that library is that they, in fact, put four libraries of the four cultural societies together.

28:20.744 --> 28:21.625
This is the core...

28:21.605 --> 28:30.318
of the National Library, plus involving the law on legal deficit.

28:30.578 --> 28:32.902
They are destroying everything.

28:32.962 --> 28:41.655
They are destroying at least one third of the library in terms of the books that really belong to the Serbian nation.

28:41.635 --> 28:54.314
But these people are Philistines, or are they, I mean, are these intelligent people who are doing this?

28:55.015 --> 29:01.164
I know, I mean, I can explain why they burned down the Oriental Institute a month before, okay?

29:01.484 --> 29:04.048
Because in the Oriental Institute you have a clear case.

29:04.838 --> 29:12.826
There are a manuscript called death test, where you have a description of the owners of the land.

29:12.926 --> 29:23.277
It's a cadastro in the right type of thing that this and this person is a real estate owner of this particular land from this point to this point.

29:23.297 --> 29:25.099
You see, there's a motive there.

29:25.479 --> 29:33.327
So, they claim at that stage of the war that 63% of the whole Bosnia is

29:33.307 --> 29:37.172
ownership of the serfs.

29:37.192 --> 29:43.300
So there is a way how the Bosnians, how the Muslim side can... Oh my!

29:43.320 --> 29:53.273
What's going on right now?

29:53.253 --> 30:17.449
If the Muslims want to prove that they are the majority owner of the land as a real estate, they will simply go to the Oriental Institute and say, okay, these are the vectors, the first real official records of the ownership of the land.

30:17.569 --> 30:19.632
We are the majority of the ownership.

30:20.489 --> 30:23.973
So they burned the Oriental Institute.

30:23.993 --> 30:25.255
So you can understand.

30:25.275 --> 30:26.436
I can understand.

30:26.456 --> 30:29.059
As sick as the motive is, you can see it.

30:29.079 --> 30:30.881
You can still understand it.

30:30.901 --> 30:37.890
Let's not give them a chance, you know, to establish some kind of international arbitrary court.

30:37.910 --> 30:39.812
So this is property we're talking about.

30:39.832 --> 30:40.192
Yes, sir.

30:40.252 --> 30:41.174
This is property.

30:41.254 --> 30:43.937
So now when we come to the National Library.

30:44.017 --> 30:45.499
I said, well, I understand.

30:45.519 --> 30:46.760
Now it's culture.

30:46.780 --> 30:48.262
Now it's heritage.

30:48.282 --> 30:49.043
Now it's history.

30:49.063 --> 30:49.163
Okay.

30:49.143 --> 30:51.026
It doesn't make sense.

30:51.046 --> 31:04.249
You know, if the Library of Congress consists of the 50 separate, 51 separate collection of the state, and if you are radical Massachusetts...

31:04.229 --> 31:05.230
Wow.

31:05.972 --> 31:07.674
And you burn that place to the ground.

31:09.016 --> 31:15.125
You are killing one... At least you are killing one fiftieth.

31:15.145 --> 31:16.367
One fiftieth.

31:16.387 --> 31:17.629
All the collections.

31:18.009 --> 31:26.421
Yeah, I mean... Just for the good comparison.

31:26.442 --> 31:28.364
But there is another motive involved in this.

31:30.227 --> 31:33.612
Another motive is that they abandoned the country, abandoned the government,

31:34.688 --> 31:36.631
and become rebels.

31:38.113 --> 31:42.580
They join their reserve nation, Serbia.

31:42.600 --> 31:44.062
The Croats do the same thing.

31:45.905 --> 31:53.676
So the only nation who does not have the reserve land are the Muslims.

31:54.432 --> 31:57.516
That is why this war is so horrible.

31:57.636 --> 32:00.940
In terms, I really do not have the place to hide.

32:02.342 --> 32:06.727
And my passport is not validated.

32:06.747 --> 32:11.653
So I have to apply to a visa.

32:11.673 --> 32:19.883
Practically everywhere where I go, in Europe, even we have a visa with Croatia, which is totally nonsense, nonsense.

32:19.863 --> 32:35.740
So I do not have the chance even to think that I have a reserve land where I can accidentally pack my things and my belongings and just flood it.

32:36.421 --> 32:47.153
And it amazes me in this world how the Muslim population, for example, are so keen to preserve the symbols of the land, the court of arms,

32:47.977 --> 32:50.561
But you've got nothing to do with the Muslims.

32:50.581 --> 32:52.623
This is a normal coat of arms.

32:52.643 --> 32:55.427
Coat of arms is the phrase, right?

32:55.527 --> 33:04.019
I just think, when I come to transcribe the tapes, I know what you're saying.

33:04.860 --> 33:06.543
Coat of arms.

33:06.623 --> 33:11.089
Have a Christian symbol on it.

33:11.109 --> 33:12.371
You know.

33:12.391 --> 33:12.711
Lilies.

33:13.152 --> 33:13.372
Six lilies.

33:13.412 --> 33:16.236
It's got nothing to do with it.

33:16.637 --> 33:16.937
It's blue.

33:18.082 --> 33:22.147
you know, with the golden lilies.

33:23.488 --> 33:26.972
It's nothing to do with the Muslims.

33:26.992 --> 33:31.698
There is no iconography of anything, even the green color.

33:31.718 --> 33:31.998
No.

33:33.820 --> 33:46.114
Because the Muslim population knows that the well-being of the state is the well-being of the nation.

33:46.516 --> 33:50.219
because they do not have the place to go.

33:50.419 --> 34:09.836
They cannot make the airlift to Istanbul, for example, because my pre-assessors were fighting for the borders of the Ottoman Empire at the same time when Kemal Ataturk made a modern Turkey.

34:10.777 --> 34:16.202
So we were the last rebels who believe in Padişah, in the Sultan,

34:17.043 --> 34:30.006
While Kemal Atatürk, a brave person and a wise man, made the Turkey, as we know, in borders where it's located now, modernized administration, etc.

34:31.083 --> 34:35.768
So that is why we are so affiliated to the country.

34:35.788 --> 34:38.591
That is why we always have a peace of heart.

34:38.792 --> 34:42.776
That is why I am so optimistic that people will return.

34:42.796 --> 34:56.652
But what it makes me is that the international community do not recognize in proper terms what is going on or what's been going on, even in the country.

34:56.672 --> 34:57.833
In the country, you know.

34:58.252 --> 35:00.435
It is a clear genocide.

35:01.056 --> 35:04.581
I think we understand that.

35:04.601 --> 35:11.872
But we refer to it as the ethical cleansing.

35:11.892 --> 35:17.861
This ethical cleansing is also the concept of the total waste plant.

35:18.823 --> 35:23.229
So I will kill you, I will rape you, I will destroy everything that you have.

35:23.249 --> 35:25.212
Your house, okay, I will rebuild the house.

35:25.412 --> 35:26.554
But your monuments,

35:27.445 --> 35:36.906
The symbols, the memory, history, literature, whatever.

35:36.927 --> 35:40.695
Like these are things, like the culture is...

35:41.266 --> 36:01.182
glass of beer that we can drink so the bottle is so the glass is empty or we can accidentally spill like it's something like the car like the culture in total is something material no it is not

36:01.162 --> 36:12.534
I mean, if I like William Butler Yeats, it is part of my imaginary world.

36:12.554 --> 36:17.299
If I like his poetry, I receive this poetry.

36:17.319 --> 36:19.001
It's in my head.

36:19.021 --> 36:22.104
We all have the museums in our head.

36:22.124 --> 36:25.628
Ten best movies, ten best books.

36:25.648 --> 36:28.671
Do you have in your head the books that were destroyed?

36:28.651 --> 36:42.080
Yeah, I have my imaginary museum that consists of ten best movies, ten best books that I ever read.

36:42.280 --> 36:46.930
Yeah, but the movies you can see here, the books you can read here, even if you have to get other copies, but the ones that are destroyed in your library here.

36:46.910 --> 36:49.554
in the National University Library.

36:50.215 --> 36:52.899
I'm asking a philosophical question.

36:52.919 --> 36:53.940
Yeah, there's a question.

36:54.200 --> 37:03.033
Well, now there's a challenge how to find out, how to figure out, is there a heaven?

37:03.233 --> 37:06.538
And heaven must be a library, definitely.

37:06.518 --> 37:14.987
Is there some kind of... I'm teasing, but... No, no, it's my favorite phrase.

37:15.007 --> 37:17.189
It's Carton Bachelard original.

37:17.209 --> 37:27.920
If there is a heaven, the heaven must be a great library so the books can easily fall from the sky.

37:27.940 --> 37:35.648
Now, what is inspiring and what gives me that mystical hope that...

37:35.628 --> 37:47.908
is maybe there is a possibility to reconstruct, at least, to reconstruct the several parts of the library.

37:47.928 --> 37:50.932
Well, there's a structure.

37:50.952 --> 37:57.543
You can reconstruct the architecture, the building, but can you replicate what you lost?

37:57.563 --> 38:00.808
Definitely not the original manuscripts that are not microfilms.

38:00.788 --> 38:04.251
But how catastrophic was that?

38:04.331 --> 38:08.155
I mean, I've seen some numbers.

38:08.175 --> 38:08.595
Beyond belief, right?

38:08.615 --> 38:10.517
Beyond the wildest imagination.

38:10.697 --> 38:20.466
The collection of the Oriental Institute is, for example, 200,000 of separate sheets of the so-called Turkish archives.

38:22.267 --> 38:30.795
This is the legal stuff inherited from the Turkish government, from the government of Turkish authority before the Austrians came.

38:30.775 --> 38:52.687
That was the part first of the collection of National Museum and then transferred to the Oriental Institute and the collection of approximately 1600 manuscripts, written manuscripts.

38:52.747 --> 38:54.290
That is irreplaceable.

38:54.310 --> 38:58.656
But there is a hope that some of the published items

38:59.395 --> 39:02.561
because of the multiplied copies, can be traced.

39:03.463 --> 39:04.865
And how is that working?

39:04.885 --> 39:06.628
Are you finding some of these things?

39:07.250 --> 39:15.545
I know about what Andras is working on over here at Harvard, but has there been any kind of measurable success in this?

39:15.745 --> 39:17.148
Measurable at this point?

39:17.208 --> 39:17.469
No.

39:18.190 --> 39:20.434
But the miracles happen sometimes.

39:20.935 --> 39:21.977
Defend the mind.

39:21.957 --> 39:43.125
Libraria of a Slovanic Collection at Michigan University, Janet Crane, sent me via this first shipment that is on our way to Bosnia today, from Boston to Sarajevo, two small packages of duplicates.

39:43.165 --> 39:48.572
For most of the stuff, most of the stuffs are familiar

39:48.805 --> 39:53.991
National University Library does not have most of the stuff.

39:54.011 --> 39:55.153
It does not.

39:55.173 --> 39:59.278
It does not, but it can be easily purchased on the streets.

40:00.039 --> 40:03.183
There are people who have these particular books.

40:03.623 --> 40:09.891
Three or four of them are totally ridiculous books that does not belong to this particular collection.

40:09.911 --> 40:15.298
But two of the items are unpriceless.

40:17.321 --> 40:18.542
Unpriceless, because

40:19.383 --> 40:36.190
In the duplicate fund she found the first volume of Nasostarina, our Antiquist, the journal of the Institute for the Preservation of Cultural Monument in Bosnia.

40:36.630 --> 40:37.712
I think I will have

40:38.198 --> 40:45.470
Definitely, we will get drunk, me and the director of the institute, because this is the missing volume.

40:45.491 --> 40:48.315
This is the, no one has it.

40:49.137 --> 40:49.858
First volume.

40:49.938 --> 40:51.942
So where was this found?

40:52.683 --> 40:53.805
In Michigan.

40:54.907 --> 40:55.408
You're kidding me.

40:55.728 --> 40:56.029
Yeah.

40:56.149 --> 40:57.231
How recent is this?

40:59.094 --> 40:59.194
Well,

40:59.461 --> 41:25.317
you know most of the libraries who deals with the Slavonic stuff and collections uh during the they establish some kind of relations uh yeah it's amazing the second book is uh i'm curious to see the second book because it's a book on both here to govina published something in stuttgart in uh

41:25.533 --> 41:27.757
1914.

41:29.460 --> 41:32.786
I know the author but I never see the book.

41:33.988 --> 41:43.926
So practically means this book definitely does not exist in the National Museum Library which is safe and sound.

41:45.148 --> 41:48.975
So I'm very keen to see what is that book.

41:48.955 --> 41:54.101
For this book, I don't know.

41:54.122 --> 42:05.796
So the triumphs are by individual, by single numbers, aren't they?

42:07.999 --> 42:09.541
When you have a triumph of great success, it's not finding the whole archive.

42:09.561 --> 42:11.403
It's one book at a time, really, isn't it?

42:11.423 --> 42:11.984
And they had a very sad way.

42:12.004 --> 42:15.148
Yes, but now what is important in terms of how the thing is operating,

42:15.955 --> 42:21.725
to repute rivers, all the bibliographies, which also were destroyed.

42:22.026 --> 42:27.816
Yeah, but thanks God I'm a bibliograph for myself, so I have the crucial ones.

42:27.856 --> 42:39.938
Five or six retrospective bibliographies, apart of retrospective bibliographies, I have, so first thing is to reprint them.

42:39.918 --> 42:44.167
in order to use it as a wish list or the checklist.

42:44.528 --> 42:47.174
Is it the answer of what you have lost?

42:47.354 --> 42:48.898
Is that what it is?

42:49.399 --> 42:49.479
Yes.

42:49.579 --> 42:51.543
Because that's amazing, isn't it?

42:51.664 --> 42:55.392
Yes, because the bibliography of books no longer exists.

42:55.412 --> 42:59.701
Yes, but let's hope that we will reconstruct most of this stuff.

42:59.721 --> 43:00.002
We're hopeful.

42:59.982 --> 43:04.896
Definitely I'm hopeful because I'm doing these things and I'm pushing these things.

43:04.916 --> 43:08.526
So I'm going to write about it.

43:09.529 --> 43:11.574
So I'm going to help you.

43:11.595 --> 43:15.004
The problem is... This is how the things operate.

43:14.984 --> 43:21.754
We present, we have a cultural week of Bosnian culture in Vienna.

43:21.775 --> 43:30.368
You know, the attitude of the Republic of Austria toward Bosnia is okay.

43:30.788 --> 43:32.231
It never changes.

43:32.792 --> 43:35.035
Now they want to do something visible.

43:36.348 --> 43:42.542
and they are supporters of the Bosnian cause for the obvious historical reasons, and we are grateful for that.

43:42.863 --> 43:54.188
We have an excellent partnership in lots of fields, including taking care of our refugees, the problem with the students and other things.

43:54.168 --> 44:02.184
And there is a separate part of that whole program that will present the Jewish Sephardic tradition of Bosnia.

44:02.204 --> 44:10.942
And it is hosted and sponsored by the mighty Jewish community, which is Ashkenazi of Vienna.

44:10.962 --> 44:14.168
And I just developed a very simple idea.

44:14.873 --> 44:20.358
Please, let us not have a fancy full-color catalog of the event.

44:21.599 --> 44:29.827
Instead of that, let's use the money for the printing of such a catalog to reprint the book.

44:30.207 --> 44:33.790
And I suggested which book to reprint.

44:35.171 --> 44:42.518
Then they, of course, go to the National Library in Vienna, by the way.

44:42.852 --> 44:49.070
Now, the National Library in Vienna celebrates one millennium of existence.

44:49.090 --> 44:55.950
They find a photocopy of the book that was originally published in Salary in 1911.

44:57.196 --> 45:10.316
So by some kind of a miracle, I have in my personal possession the only book, even the Jewish community library, the small library of the Jewish community, etc., does not have this book.

45:10.517 --> 45:24.098
So it is an amazing thing to do the reprint of this book, plus in the same volume we will do a translation on the Bosnian language.

45:24.567 --> 45:29.918
Any day after, you'll do what on the Bosnian language?

45:29.938 --> 45:31.521
What was the word?

45:31.541 --> 45:33.806
What was the word?

45:33.826 --> 45:34.367
Bosnian language.

45:34.508 --> 45:37.614
You'll do what on the Bosnian language?

45:37.634 --> 45:42.665
In the same language, originally in Germany, on German, so you'll make a translation to the Bosnian in the same volume.

45:42.685 --> 45:43.326
What does it mean?

45:43.346 --> 45:44.348
It means a lot.

45:44.328 --> 45:58.305
in terms that the people who are visiting these events, these exhibitions, will have something to buy, a souvenir.

45:58.325 --> 46:00.210
A souvenir will be the book.

46:00.578 --> 46:22.468
And the substance of this book is a detailed explanation of the tolerance of everyday living in Sarajevo, and the description of the tolerance of two communities, the ruling and majority Muslim community, and

46:22.448 --> 46:26.216
The small one, mighty Jewish.

46:26.316 --> 46:27.819
Can I ask you a question now?

46:27.839 --> 46:30.204
Did you have a point that you wanted to make?

46:30.284 --> 46:31.647
Yes, I would like to make a point.

46:31.667 --> 46:34.753
This is a reference to me because I edited the book.

46:35.324 --> 46:41.370
So my next step is to find an American partner to do the same thing.

46:42.611 --> 46:46.135
To make a translation of the very small book.

46:46.155 --> 46:48.577
It's 120 pages.

46:48.677 --> 46:49.838
It's nothing.

46:49.858 --> 46:52.601
Plus it has 27 original photographs.

46:52.901 --> 46:53.622
Nothing.

46:53.742 --> 46:57.366
In terms of BTP publishing and anything.

46:57.566 --> 47:02.631
Because that is the way how to spread the disease.

47:03.640 --> 47:10.791
You know, how to get people infected by a very simple problem.

47:10.991 --> 47:21.847
That there is no money that some of it is granted for the buying of books, for the reconstruction of these things.

47:22.307 --> 47:27.635
Because we are the black holes, if you count... The black holes, is that what you said?

47:27.655 --> 47:28.476
Yeah, black holes.

47:28.497 --> 47:28.777
Black holes.

47:28.797 --> 47:30.560
I'm just saying it on the train, so I understand.

47:30.580 --> 47:30.880
Black holes.

47:32.260 --> 47:45.426
And definitely, the reconstruction of the library and the reconstruction of other things that do the culture will not be the top priority for the Mighty Ones in terms of

47:45.963 --> 47:55.676
of this arrangement of how to reconstruct the Bosnia.

47:55.697 --> 48:00.864
You know, you need 70 million dollars to reconstruct the building and the... 70?

48:00.884 --> 48:01.284
Yes, 70 million.

48:01.304 --> 48:03.988
To reconstruct the building and the basic fund.

48:04.306 --> 48:11.200
What you have in your pocket is less than 50,000 American dollars.

48:11.280 --> 48:15.007
So you have to be very, very realistic.

48:15.308 --> 48:25.268
But you have to do something because you have to develop the feasible program of support.

48:25.248 --> 48:29.415
So, let me get to the point.

48:29.475 --> 48:46.723
This is a reference to me, because now I have an opportunity to think, or maybe to develop a program, how to reprint this book and spread it all over the United States.

48:47.424 --> 48:49.467
For the sake of the...

48:49.717 --> 49:04.314
For the sake of the simple book, because there are other books that need to be reprinted, because they are essential.

49:04.334 --> 49:06.878
They have a crucial value for Bosnia.

49:06.898 --> 49:08.259
Can I ask you a question now?

49:08.499 --> 49:10.662
I know you've written about it, but...

49:11.435 --> 49:17.067
And I hate to ask you to relive that night when that library was attacked.

49:17.087 --> 49:17.287
Yeah.

49:17.307 --> 49:18.730
Did you feel that that was a mistake?

49:18.750 --> 49:20.534
That was a horrible mistake?

49:20.554 --> 49:24.402
That that was just one of the... I was frightened to death.

49:24.422 --> 49:24.482
No.

49:24.749 --> 49:27.732
Considering the sounds of the shells that dropped.

49:27.832 --> 49:30.255
It was deliberately being targeted.

49:30.335 --> 49:31.897
Deliberately being targeted.

49:32.397 --> 49:45.912
That is my real feeling, but... I know they plotted the pattern of the shells, so it's obvious that they were bracketing it, as we say in there.

49:45.932 --> 49:48.495
None of the shells, all the shells...

49:48.475 --> 49:49.998
Hit the target.

49:50.018 --> 49:51.682
That's right.

49:51.842 --> 49:56.993
I mean, attack lasted 12 minutes, you know.

49:58.076 --> 49:59.158
Very precise.

49:59.459 --> 50:03.888
And you've described the next day of actually seeing pages come out of the sky.

50:03.908 --> 50:05.151
That's terrible.

50:06.768 --> 50:07.931
It was so hot.

50:08.672 --> 50:17.632
Summer in Sarajevo is practically very unpleasant because we are surrounded by hills.

50:17.853 --> 50:20.238
And nothing moves.

50:20.378 --> 50:25.249
It was over 27 degrees Celsius scale.

50:25.651 --> 50:42.997
without the water, without anything, plus the smoke and the leaves really going very, there was no wind in nothing.

50:43.017 --> 50:44.319
And the leaves of the burning roots going like this, very slowly.

50:44.339 --> 50:44.419
Yes.

50:44.399 --> 50:49.896
And really, we can pick it.

50:49.916 --> 50:50.919
It's still a leaf.

50:51.120 --> 50:51.260
A leaf.

50:51.280 --> 50:53.206
Believe it.

50:53.949 --> 50:54.791
It's hot.

50:54.811 --> 50:55.995
You can even read it.

50:56.397 --> 51:01.822
You can actually see it disintegrating in your head.

51:02.863 --> 51:03.123
Yeah.

51:03.944 --> 51:06.506
It is, let's say, the text is black.

51:07.126 --> 51:10.729
The background is gray.

51:11.770 --> 51:13.112
And you can feel the heat.

51:13.792 --> 51:18.877
And the instant the heat goes into your plumb, it all melts.

51:21.159 --> 51:22.780
This is not smoking area.

51:23.020 --> 51:23.661
I will show you.

51:23.681 --> 51:25.122
I understand what you're saying.

51:26.114 --> 51:30.181
They do it outside.

51:31.103 --> 51:37.634
That's crazy, but like you're the last person ever.

51:39.077 --> 51:45.028
Have a chance to maybe read a line or two, a word or two.

51:45.909 --> 51:47.532
Like you're the last person ever.

51:47.917 --> 51:51.544
on the earth doing this.

51:51.564 --> 51:54.249
Did you feel this when this was happening?

51:54.269 --> 51:56.613
That was the most horrible.

51:56.633 --> 51:58.998
And did you try to catch as many cages as you could?

51:59.038 --> 52:00.080
But what can I do with that?

52:00.240 --> 52:01.542
Collect the ashes?

52:01.562 --> 52:05.369
Because when you catch it, it melts.

52:05.470 --> 52:08.074
When you catch it, it melts.

52:08.094 --> 52:09.036
So what did you feel?

52:09.056 --> 52:09.537
I mean, what was your...

52:09.517 --> 52:12.562
I was terrified for that.

52:12.662 --> 52:13.203
Terrified for fear?

52:13.223 --> 52:15.387
Terrified for the consequences?

52:15.407 --> 52:19.694
Now, terrified that the next library will be my library, the time in charge.

52:19.714 --> 52:22.398
I was in the middle of an evacuation of my library.

52:23.039 --> 52:24.281
I'm sorry, you know what?

52:24.441 --> 52:27.506
I am in the middle of an evacuation of my library.

52:27.666 --> 52:29.710
A relocation, is that the word?

52:29.730 --> 52:30.751
Relocation, yes.

52:30.772 --> 52:31.693
I have to relocate.

52:31.713 --> 52:34.157
I'm just trying to get the words so I understand it, yes.

52:34.711 --> 52:40.860
I was in the middle of my job.

52:40.880 --> 52:49.513
So theoretically speaking, hypothetically speaking, I have a rare book collection which can fit into two closets.

52:49.533 --> 52:57.565
Let's say I have 500 books that are kept separately.

52:57.585 --> 53:03.233
If someone, if my library in the National Museum

53:03.365 --> 53:25.137
is destined to be burned and if i have a chance to choose which part of the library should be burned i mean if someone give me the opportunity it's like picking which of your kitchen is going to be shot well i mean if someone asks me okay one way or another i have to burn your library but i will give you the chance to say will it be

53:25.522 --> 53:31.171
Will it be the library in Toronto, but you can keep the rare book collection?

53:31.191 --> 53:39.224
Or will it be a rare book collection and I will not burn your library?

53:39.244 --> 53:43.791
I will rather see, go away, burn the rare collection.

53:44.272 --> 53:44.632
Really?

53:44.792 --> 53:45.473
You know why?

53:45.493 --> 53:45.994
No, I don't.

53:46.094 --> 53:51.563
Because it's rather weird, but rare books are rare books.

53:52.741 --> 53:54.406
collected one way or another.

53:54.446 --> 54:01.969
They sometimes don't even fit into the mainstream of the collection.

54:02.270 --> 54:04.978
Sometimes rare books are, you know,

54:05.718 --> 54:07.541
By accident there.

54:07.961 --> 54:09.003
Oh, I know.

54:09.263 --> 54:10.926
I've got a book about it.

54:10.946 --> 54:11.867
By accident there.

54:11.887 --> 54:13.529
They reflect one person's obsession, perhaps.

54:14.090 --> 54:21.220
I mean, a rare book collection in such a library, The Time in Charge, is a series of extraordinary accidents.

54:22.302 --> 54:26.869
It's almost an indulgence in a way, right?

54:27.409 --> 54:28.992
It's got a function... Limited.

54:29.012 --> 54:30.594
As you see it as a collection.

54:30.614 --> 54:31.996
It's a limited function.

54:32.116 --> 54:34.780
Yeah, but if you see that this is a hoard, is that...

54:35.131 --> 54:36.933
Because of the binding, yes.

54:36.953 --> 54:37.774
What is that?

54:37.854 --> 54:39.836
Because of the scripture.

54:39.856 --> 54:40.357
What is that?

54:40.377 --> 54:45.843
Because, you know, there is a story how this book came and blah, blah, blah.

54:46.204 --> 54:51.990
So every picture tells a story, every book tells a story, but so what?

54:52.571 --> 54:55.074
But take it away.

54:55.895 --> 55:04.885
But the real collection of the museum library are the full-scale collections of

55:05.472 --> 55:13.447
and got periodicals from the Austrian times, I mean sets number one to last published.

55:13.467 --> 55:19.759
Total sets of periodicals, total sets of the book that were produced during the Austrian times.

55:20.100 --> 55:24.308
We have more than 16 private companies producing the books.

55:25.435 --> 55:37.313
I got an extended collection of the books that we acquired in the library due to the international exchange partners.

55:37.333 --> 55:40.217
You got everything there, the full collection.

55:40.238 --> 55:44.524
We covered 100% of the archaeology of Bosnia.

55:45.247 --> 56:04.183
75% of ethnology and related studies, if you are researching ethnology of Bosnia, and approximately 42% of natural sciences, if you are expert in natural sciences.

56:04.163 --> 56:10.732
Is this material that is basically unique to this library?

56:10.752 --> 56:10.972
Yes.

56:11.332 --> 56:24.990
In time, the most beautiful books in the museum libraries are from the Austrian times, because in the Austrian times, somehow, this library was a deficit library.

56:24.970 --> 56:39.573
So it serves like a national library because you have to understand that Austrians are not keen or their attitude over the Bosnia were not the development of the national institutions.

56:40.314 --> 56:50.269
But one way or another they established a museum, London's museum, meaning Glenn Museum, Grand Museum, this museum, because Bosnia is a part of the occupation territory.

56:51.413 --> 57:02.064
So it was a state-governed institution, and they have developed the passion of samlung, of the collections.

57:03.706 --> 57:06.849
So they passionately make collections.

57:07.650 --> 57:09.812
One of these collections also is a library.

57:10.673 --> 57:19.142
So regardless of the thing that it is not a deposit library in the full sense, each and everyone contributed, I mean,

57:19.510 --> 57:43.054
to that library so in that time of the australian rule uh like a gene pool almost in a way it's unique for every every individual everything that was contributed to this library made it in terms of coverage what covers this library it got almost everything

57:43.355 --> 57:55.193
almost everything that was published from 1886 up to 1980, during the Austrian period.

57:55.954 --> 58:00.621
So this part we have.

58:01.360 --> 58:10.530
We will just have to make the duplicate for the National University Library.

58:10.971 --> 58:15.356
So in an evil way, did they destroy?

58:15.376 --> 58:20.682
Were they successful in this evil attempt to destroy?

58:20.702 --> 58:22.124
Ah, you shoot me the question.

58:22.144 --> 58:27.790
Hypothetically speaking, even if my library of the museum was totally burned out to the ground,

58:29.474 --> 58:34.683
I don't think that there are, in military terms, they are successful.

58:34.703 --> 58:39.491
But I don't think that's the context that I use the word, by the way.

58:39.511 --> 58:40.633
Successful.

58:40.653 --> 58:41.254
Successful.

58:41.774 --> 58:44.960
As a military objective, did they succeed and evolve?

58:45.941 --> 58:54.115
I still think that if all the libraries are run, there is a possibility to reconstruct...

58:54.432 --> 59:05.467
some portion of it.

59:05.567 --> 59:21.148
I will never choose as a librarian a library as a target, you know, but for some reason yet unknown to me because I practically don't want to justify them or don't want to accuse them because it's out of my scope.

59:21.128 --> 59:29.408
They tried to do something really nasty.

59:30.130 --> 59:32.175
Just a second.

59:32.195 --> 59:33.197
I'm going to close this so I don't miss any of it.
