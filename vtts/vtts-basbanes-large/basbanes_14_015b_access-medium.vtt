WEBVTT

00:05.633 --> 00:07.055
I didn't have the switch on.

00:07.075 --> 00:07.756
That was on and off.

00:07.776 --> 00:09.178
That's why it didn't happen.

00:10.420 --> 00:28.407
Well, so the impermanent, all these cells that are all very short-lived are kind of absorbed into the later cells.

00:30.109 --> 00:34.155
So the everlasting story of Nori is really the very short-lived

00:34.912 --> 00:42.061
story of Nori at a very small three-month juncture in her life.

00:43.423 --> 00:53.236
So I like the ironic flavor of the title, even though it's exciting to risk.

00:53.256 --> 01:01.206
It's almost postmodern, in a tiresome way, to risk

01:02.030 --> 01:07.836
or to risk sentiment.

01:08.336 --> 01:18.547
Because you don't get anything if you don't start with some kind of love or affection or some kind of passionate feeling about something.

01:19.868 --> 01:30.619
There are many books that I've started to write and have stopped because I just don't have a powerful enough charge of feeling to sustain

01:32.101 --> 01:33.002
the book to the end.

01:33.243 --> 01:35.706
I mean, you know it from your own books.

01:35.726 --> 01:41.794
It's a tremendous amount of work to do these things, to compress it all into one finished thing.

01:42.234 --> 01:49.925
Unless you really have the feeling that there's something desperately important about it, I'm too lazy to get it done.

01:50.826 --> 01:55.592
Unless I have the feeling I'm too lazy to get it done.

01:56.814 --> 02:01.500
And the feeling here is just a primitive one of

02:02.999 --> 02:13.288
of wanting to be able to remember what my daughter was like, more or less.

02:13.749 --> 02:17.672
I think it's the guy who's driving me around.

02:17.752 --> 02:19.114
We'll be wrapping up pretty soon.

02:19.134 --> 02:22.717
We'll be wrapping up pretty quickly.

02:22.837 --> 02:33.006
Go ahead, just finish that thought.

02:33.948 --> 02:41.678
I'm glad I got you first this morning.

02:41.738 --> 02:45.002
That's another reason I'd like to get the first book of the day, by the way.

02:45.022 --> 03:01.542
Well, you know, the other weird thing is, in some ways it's an easier book to read from and to think about and to do interviews about, because I feel as if I'm not kind of exhibiting a piece of my own life.

03:01.960 --> 03:11.853
All the other books are more or less about me or about bits of my own imagination that I've artificially kind of... The Fermata, for instance.

03:12.034 --> 03:18.022
I mean, that was a childhood fantasy of mine, that I could stop time and do all these adolescent things.

03:19.824 --> 03:20.945
Fox?

03:20.966 --> 03:24.931
Fox was, you know, what would these two people say?

03:25.391 --> 03:27.474
Well, I'll use my own imagination.

03:27.534 --> 03:29.477
But that's not drawn from you.

03:29.577 --> 03:31.039
Is that drawn from your own...

03:31.745 --> 03:40.775
No, no, but it's drawn from my own imagination of what would be, you know, if you're typing along, you think, what would be funny or arousing?

03:40.795 --> 03:44.199
I think we should put that into context.

03:44.219 --> 03:44.819
Go ahead.

03:44.839 --> 03:45.120
Yeah, yeah.

03:45.160 --> 03:48.663
You mentioned that they're all drawn from aspects of your own self.

03:48.844 --> 03:53.148
So you should probably put books into some better context.

03:53.168 --> 03:53.288
Right.

03:53.308 --> 04:00.216
Well, I mean, they're all products of my imaginative self, shall we say.

04:01.107 --> 04:17.270
Even a book like The Size of Thoughts, which is non-fiction, and I go around interviewing people and stuff, I am personally interested in fingernail clippers, and therefore I'm going to do a piece on it.

04:17.290 --> 04:26.924
But this one, I put myself aside, and I just decided to kind of see what I could do with this other person.

04:27.285 --> 04:30.169
It's true that she's my flesh and blood, and so I know her better.

04:30.318 --> 04:44.137
It's not a big leap of imagination, really, but there is more of an active, this kind of solipsistic person that I naturally am and I enjoy being.

04:45.399 --> 04:54.271
I was able to hold down for a bit in order to look at somebody else.

04:56.134 --> 04:58.637
Well, our pop-up books and paper engineers, you're

04:58.921 --> 05:02.665
interest or hers, for instance.

05:02.965 --> 05:06.589
Actually, we share that interest, because I collect pop-up books.

05:07.810 --> 05:10.573
You're going to be very important.

05:10.653 --> 05:13.455
Forget the rest, but that's like Pepys.

05:14.136 --> 05:17.239
I got in on that from the very beginning.

05:17.279 --> 05:22.665
I love the ones that really are dated in time, too, like the royal family, the pop-up book.

05:22.765 --> 05:26.008
There's Charles and Diana and the Queen, and they're all clapping.

05:26.309 --> 05:30.114
That's a fact of great collectors I have already.

05:30.134 --> 05:36.441
No, when I was doing that thing on books as furniture, in The Size of Thoughts, I went with Alice, in fact.

05:36.521 --> 05:38.564
I said, let's go to the children's section.

05:38.584 --> 05:44.971
I want you to pick out the pop-up, the strange books, the books that are like toys that interest you.

05:45.432 --> 05:52.300
And that's why I came through it, because I was doing the idea of books being, you know, books trying to become more than

05:52.718 --> 05:56.023
books, but also books celebrating their flappiness.

05:56.043 --> 05:59.568
Well, the tactile nature of the book.

05:59.608 --> 06:00.189
Right.

06:00.329 --> 06:00.990
Exactly.

06:01.010 --> 06:03.774
So you get all those doors and everything.

06:04.315 --> 06:09.563
Long before interactivity became a, you know, like books don't have interactive aspects.

06:09.743 --> 06:10.484
Right.

06:10.644 --> 06:18.876
The Mystery of the Russian Ruby was one of the ones that I wrote about, where you open one page and you've got a bookcase and it opens and there's a disappearing foot.

06:18.896 --> 06:19.317
That's great.

06:19.972 --> 06:20.933
Just amazing things.

06:20.953 --> 06:30.322
But there's a guy, Chuck, somebody, Chuck, not Chuck Norris, Chuck Russell, Chuck Noe, who did a one, two, one, two, three, four, five.

06:30.382 --> 06:31.103
It's black and white.

06:31.363 --> 06:37.189
When you open it, all these colored animals and creatures come out of the numbers.

06:37.249 --> 06:40.392
That is one of the finest ones I've ever seen.

06:40.412 --> 06:41.013
You've got to go.

06:41.033 --> 06:42.794
Would you say, did you inscribe my book for me?

06:43.475 --> 06:43.735
I would.

06:43.755 --> 06:46.118
I'd be happy to.

06:46.138 --> 06:47.559
I'll even give you a nice crumb pen.

06:47.739 --> 06:49.641
Yeah, I didn't quite finish that thing, but...

06:50.077 --> 06:59.786
about the love part, you know, but... This is the book I'm proudest of.

07:00.967 --> 07:01.528
Really?

07:02.249 --> 07:02.849
Yeah.

07:03.550 --> 07:06.873
Jesus Christ, did I get my kicker in the very last minute?

07:06.893 --> 07:07.093
Yeah.

07:08.274 --> 07:19.645
Well, but I think it's because I finally succeeded in...

07:21.835 --> 07:36.853
in catching on paper some of the reasons that I think life is worth living or some... That's nice.

07:36.873 --> 07:39.456
Yeah, I think that's maybe part of it.

07:39.476 --> 07:41.999
There's a period right there.

07:42.120 --> 07:45.624
It's a perfect... It's excellent.

07:45.644 --> 07:49.969
Okay, so let's see.

07:49.989 --> 07:50.830
Let me shut this up.
