WEBVTT

00:04.368 --> 00:04.949
Um, Kolb.

00:06.070 --> 00:06.630
Philip Kolb.

00:06.650 --> 00:07.191
Philip Kolb.

00:07.331 --> 00:08.012
One L and Philip.

00:09.093 --> 00:09.593
Pardon me?

00:09.673 --> 00:10.494
One L and Philip.

00:10.634 --> 00:11.055
I think so, yeah.

00:11.075 --> 00:11.895
I think so.

00:12.296 --> 00:12.976
K-O-L-B?

00:13.237 --> 00:13.517
Mm-hmm.

00:13.537 --> 00:15.159
Yeah, he was a French professor here.

00:15.539 --> 00:17.040
His daughter now teaches at Smith, actually.

00:17.060 --> 00:17.361
Really?

00:17.441 --> 00:18.081
And when was this?

00:18.802 --> 00:19.022
Mm-hmm.

00:19.042 --> 00:20.163
When did he do this?

00:21.545 --> 00:23.226
Oh, Nancy, when was Kolb here?

00:23.707 --> 00:27.471
When did he collect his proof?

00:27.491 --> 00:29.833
He died two years ago, and he's been working with proofs for about four years.

00:29.853 --> 00:29.953
Okay.

00:30.608 --> 00:35.759
He'd go over to Paris in the summer, the way I get, and he'd buy a letter for $30 here, $20 there.

00:37.061 --> 00:40.328
Now, at auction, they're, you know, $10,000 a piece.

00:40.448 --> 00:42.493
Do you get anything written on this?

00:43.835 --> 00:47.884
I don't think so, and this is an interesting story.

00:47.944 --> 00:48.746
Or Carl Lee.

00:49.708 --> 00:50.389
It's a good story.

00:50.673 --> 00:54.699
Was he acquiring for the university or for himself, and then did he give it to the university?

00:54.879 --> 00:58.003
Nancy, did he acquire for himself and then give it, or did he...?

00:58.244 --> 01:03.831
He made that he was there and was 100 times working in a business at National and scouring around trying to find others for us to buy.

01:03.852 --> 01:04.212
Okay.

01:04.432 --> 01:07.697
He bought some for himself, but then later he gave them to us.

01:07.717 --> 01:09.379
So is it called the Philip Kolb?

01:09.499 --> 01:11.983
It's called the Kolb Proust Archive.

01:12.143 --> 01:12.784
That's great.

01:12.844 --> 01:14.166
And how many items?

01:14.821 --> 01:16.402
Boy, how many letters do we have?

01:16.563 --> 01:17.203
It's a lot.

01:18.905 --> 01:20.026
And who are the letters to?

01:20.086 --> 01:24.149
I mean, are they... Oh, very... I mean, everybody.

01:24.730 --> 01:27.693
You are going to have to visit the archive.

01:27.753 --> 01:31.256
I mean, you're going to have to go on to Carlene because... Is Carlene there?

01:31.576 --> 01:31.816
Yes.

01:32.037 --> 01:34.058
She's expecting... Tom's not going to be there, does she?

01:34.078 --> 01:36.781
And this is something that you're scanning and you're making available?

01:37.221 --> 01:37.541
Yeah.

01:37.561 --> 01:39.603
And it's very generous of the university to do that.

01:39.643 --> 01:41.265
A lot of universities... I know.

01:41.625 --> 01:42.706
That's what's neat about this place.

01:42.786 --> 01:44.828
The University of Texas would ever do that with...

01:44.808 --> 01:48.795
We're doing here, there's going to be a huge conference here.

01:48.815 --> 01:55.867
We're going to have a huge boost seminar here in whatever that anniversary year is, 2000.

01:55.927 --> 01:57.930
We're going to have a huge conference.

01:57.950 --> 02:01.416
We're going to have an exhibition at Krannert Art Museum, another exhibit up here.

02:01.666 --> 02:03.349
We're loaning things to the end.

02:05.272 --> 02:13.745
You should have a statement that Bob wrote on Access that was published in the university newsletter last year.

02:13.765 --> 02:15.047
Do you know the one I'm talking about?

02:15.067 --> 02:16.029
I do, but I can't say it.

02:16.049 --> 02:17.291
I don't know where you're going to get it.

02:17.331 --> 02:20.196
We have to get all this stuff together and send it to you, Nick.

02:20.556 --> 02:21.998
That's fine.

02:22.099 --> 02:25.023
I'd love to, just before we forget, that Des Moines statement.

02:25.103 --> 02:27.687
Oh, yeah, the Freedom to Read statement.

02:27.928 --> 02:28.028
Yeah.

02:28.227 --> 02:54.842
the cold thing is interesting because we went to auction last year actually November of 96 to get the proof letters that were finally released that were about his homosexuality and they were front page on New York Times and everything and we and actually our university librarian Bob Wedgworth told me to go ahead and try to get him and so we hired an agent and she tried to get him and the interesting story there is that

02:54.991 --> 03:02.341
She called me from London, and she said there were about 60 people sitting in this room, and one phone call, and one person.

03:02.361 --> 03:04.904
To this day, Anonymous bought every single letter.

03:05.125 --> 03:07.047
And all these people were sitting there waiting for the business.

03:07.067 --> 03:07.548
How long ago?

03:07.568 --> 03:09.430
This was in November of 96.

03:09.571 --> 03:11.293
So it couldn't have been Carlton Lake.

03:11.313 --> 03:12.495
We don't know who it is.

03:12.515 --> 03:13.115
Somebody knows.

03:13.256 --> 03:19.965
I mean, I'm sure that somebody knows, but we do know it wasn't the Bibliotech Nacional.

03:20.445 --> 03:23.209
We know it was a private collector.

03:23.847 --> 03:31.797
The bibliotech now, through the auction house, asked this person, look, we don't know who you are, but could we copy these or something?

03:32.458 --> 03:33.359
And he or she said no.

03:33.600 --> 03:34.561
With a letter of copy.

03:35.202 --> 03:35.762
No.

03:35.883 --> 03:36.964
It's terrible.

03:36.984 --> 03:39.207
Business person making an investment.

03:39.467 --> 03:41.089
Totally anti-intellectual.

03:41.270 --> 03:42.471
Exactly.

03:43.913 --> 03:50.902
But what this prompted me to do is we just did a joint purchase of a manuscript with the Newberry Library because the Newberry couldn't afford it and we couldn't afford it.

03:50.962 --> 03:51.643
And I said, you know,

03:52.079 --> 03:56.384
We have to keep these things out of private hands and get them into public, sort of public institutions.

03:57.105 --> 03:57.525
We'll do it.

03:57.585 --> 03:58.827
We'll do it whatever way we can.

03:58.907 --> 03:59.527
So we did it.

03:59.547 --> 04:00.849
What did you buy in your area of Newbury?

04:01.650 --> 04:03.131
We bought a manuscript.

04:03.151 --> 04:04.132
14th century?

04:04.152 --> 04:05.414
Yeah, 14th century.

04:05.434 --> 04:06.675
It was earlier than it, wasn't it?

04:06.695 --> 04:06.875
No.

04:06.976 --> 04:08.938
Nancy, is that 14th century, that manuscript?

04:08.958 --> 04:09.819
That's 14th century.

04:10.139 --> 04:12.542
I can give you a newsletter about that.

04:12.562 --> 04:16.186
Okay, but how did you come to the... Because I have a friend there.

04:16.226 --> 04:17.067
It's a network.

04:17.127 --> 04:21.732
We all, like Lynn said, there's a network of us out there, and I have a friend.

04:22.100 --> 04:26.668
And he and I had lunch one day, and he said, hey, let's buy some stuff together.

04:26.688 --> 04:29.373
That's really quite revolutionary.

04:29.393 --> 04:30.034
It is.

04:30.054 --> 04:30.595
It's great.

04:30.615 --> 04:33.160
That's another story, because apparently it is revolutionary.

04:33.180 --> 04:38.289
When I was accepted into the Grollier Club, that's what they interviewed me about, is how did you do this?

04:38.830 --> 04:41.875
And it's a public institution and a private institution.

04:41.895 --> 04:43.939
And I said, well, you know, we just did it.

04:44.459 --> 04:47.604
We just had the attorneys worry about all the weaknesses.

04:47.624 --> 04:52.251
Because after that Proust experience, I said to myself, this is not going to happen again, you know.

04:52.291 --> 04:54.635
And this manuscript is being used.

04:54.655 --> 04:58.742
I mean, we have a student in our history who is actively using that manuscript.

04:58.842 --> 05:01.306
And I have a call from the Newberry.

05:01.346 --> 05:03.128
They want it, because somebody there wants to use it.

05:03.148 --> 05:05.552
So where is the permanent home, or is this wherever it is?

05:05.572 --> 05:09.058
The permanent home is at, let's see, it's eight months.

05:09.078 --> 05:09.859
It's in Newton, right?

05:10.008 --> 05:12.952
It's two-thirds of the time at the Newberry and one-third here.

05:13.212 --> 05:15.635
They must have put in two-thirds of the money, is that right?

05:15.675 --> 05:16.276
Yeah.

05:16.296 --> 05:17.777
But we're kind of loose about the whole thing.

05:17.857 --> 05:19.459
I can't tell you how much we paid, by the way.

05:20.501 --> 05:21.842
Was it at auction?

05:21.862 --> 05:22.203
No, no.

05:22.803 --> 05:23.785
It was through a private dealer.

05:24.906 --> 05:25.567
And when was this?

05:26.368 --> 05:27.769
In, let's see, about a year ago.

05:29.171 --> 05:29.992
Yeah, it's really neat.

05:30.373 --> 05:31.594
It's a genealogy roll.

05:32.468 --> 05:39.410
Is there anything that you want to see that you want to show?

05:39.430 --> 05:40.534
It's up to you.

05:40.614 --> 05:41.497
I mean, it's a rare book.

05:41.537 --> 05:45.550
Because we have 35 minutes now to go see Cole Proust and then go see Beth.

05:45.665 --> 05:46.868
And he wants to see the stacks.

05:46.888 --> 05:48.472
I really want to see nine million books.

05:48.492 --> 05:48.953
You do.

05:49.073 --> 05:49.414
Yeah.

05:49.434 --> 05:51.178
We should probably go to the stacks right now.

05:51.399 --> 05:51.980
That's my kind of thing.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.283
Yeah, we'll go up and see Carly.

05:53.344 --> 05:53.845
I just wondered.

05:53.885 --> 05:54.787
Okay, this is good.

05:54.807 --> 05:55.910
Well, we can talk.

05:56.531 --> 05:56.752
Sure.

05:57.233 --> 05:58.336
Should I inscribe that book?

05:58.356 --> 05:58.436
Yes.

05:58.576 --> 06:00.721
And if you want to see... Is this your book?

06:00.761 --> 06:03.488
This is the book for the... Oh, okay.
