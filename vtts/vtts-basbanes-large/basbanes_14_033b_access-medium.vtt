00:07.777 --> 00:16.789
These are two books.

00:16.809 --> 00:18.931
Oh, my God.

00:18.951 --> 00:19.893
Oh, my God.

00:23.537 --> 00:24.719
Oh, this is a bibliotech.

00:24.739 --> 00:25.259
Thank you.

00:25.279 --> 00:37.395
And my small piece, in which I was using,

00:38.236 --> 00:53.596
There are all new books, all new books arrived here.

00:53.696 --> 00:56.640
Oh my goodness.

00:57.041 --> 00:58.843
Hold these notes for time.

00:59.465 --> 01:11.676
And notice the bookshelves are maybe just ten inches deep, so only one, like you said, only one book.

01:11.696 --> 01:12.257
Only one book.

01:13.718 --> 01:17.041
It's very difficult to put the second one.

01:17.061 --> 01:18.322
Uh-huh.

01:18.342 --> 01:19.263
Thirty thousand.

01:19.403 --> 01:21.004
Do you know, do you have a catalogue?

01:21.044 --> 01:22.706
Have you catalogued it?

01:22.726 --> 01:22.826
No.

01:22.906 --> 01:27.210
Because they move according to my needs.

01:27.629 --> 01:35.882
A certain book in a certain period stays in the shelf, but it has to move for certain reasons.

01:36.083 --> 01:37.325
Do you mind if I take a few pictures?

01:38.026 --> 01:38.266
Yes.

01:38.807 --> 01:39.889
Maybe one at your desk.

01:40.790 --> 01:42.493
Sitting at your desk would be great.

01:43.835 --> 01:46.800
Yes, I'm trying a translation.

01:46.820 --> 01:49.705
They try it after a minute and they cannot.

01:52.874 --> 01:54.617
A couple of shots with the books.

01:54.637 --> 01:55.539
Well, this is wonderful.

01:56.079 --> 01:59.605
Alfred E. Newman, Mad Magazine.

02:00.186 --> 02:15.372
Yes, but since one, I was published by Warner, and at the LDA there was a novel, and with all the fossils of the author,

02:16.381 --> 02:19.225
Me too, but also Newman.

02:19.245 --> 02:26.636
So I said, I am so proud of this that they prepared for me to keep a warm visit.

02:28.158 --> 02:28.719
Are you ready?

02:28.879 --> 02:30.241
Oh, yeah, I've got to get a picture of that.

02:30.261 --> 02:31.463
That's wonderful.

02:33.026 --> 02:34.408
With you holding it like that.

02:35.870 --> 02:38.293
Yeah, that's great.

02:41.117 --> 02:42.419
So how long have you lived here?

02:42.760 --> 02:45.544
How long have you lived here at this school?

02:46.013 --> 02:47.795
Six years.

02:48.896 --> 02:50.799
Did you design this with all the books?

02:52.300 --> 02:52.741
Oh, yes.

02:53.081 --> 02:54.002
Have you designed this?

02:54.383 --> 02:56.005
Yes.

02:56.125 --> 03:00.250
It's like a warren.

03:00.490 --> 03:15.227
All right, this is like alcoves of bookshelves.

03:15.663 --> 03:37.783
This is unbelievable.

03:38.584 --> 03:42.868
And two months ago I decided to take 400 books into

03:43.405 --> 03:50.876
This is the collection in here.

04:07.160 --> 04:08.161
This is the collection.

04:08.362 --> 04:10.645
This is the collection.

04:11.789 --> 04:26.989
So, alchemy, witchcraft, mnemonics, strange languages, Kabbalah, emblems, letters of hermeticism, everything.

04:27.009 --> 04:27.510
Beautiful.

04:28.251 --> 04:35.079
And where is the Aristotle book that inspired The Name of the Road?

04:35.100 --> 04:36.261
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

04:36.629 --> 04:40.114
This is beautiful.

04:40.334 --> 04:51.329
I love this light here, Mr. Echo.

04:51.910 --> 04:53.332
This light is quite wonderful.

04:53.452 --> 04:58.218
Yes, this is made by my daughter, who is an architect.

04:58.599 --> 05:03.345
She designed the...

05:03.528 --> 05:08.553
I love this lectern here.

05:09.254 --> 05:10.795
There it is, Aristotle.

05:11.336 --> 05:11.636
Look.

05:12.637 --> 05:15.740
I want to take a picture of you holding it, too.

05:15.760 --> 05:16.922
This is the Poetita.

05:17.142 --> 05:32.978
And in the last part, there is a second book, which at Ars Comica, at the end, at the end, at the end,

05:34.527 --> 05:41.874
become poisoned and poisoned.

05:45.758 --> 05:48.321
This is so important to the novel.

05:48.421 --> 05:49.041
It's amazing.

05:49.101 --> 05:50.703
It is.

05:50.743 --> 05:54.186
It became very disagreeable to you, so you put it someplace.

05:54.246 --> 06:03.015
So, it is the

06:03.738 --> 06:05.600
The real one.

06:12.107 --> 06:13.228
The real one.

06:16.852 --> 06:18.054
This is the real one.

06:18.334 --> 06:21.738
I mean, the fake made for the film.

06:22.599 --> 06:22.699
Ah.

06:23.299 --> 06:23.740
Oh, well.

06:25.442 --> 06:28.865
That's the... This is now tell us again what this is.

06:29.566 --> 06:30.207
I'll take a picture.

06:30.347 --> 06:31.689
They do fake files.

06:31.769 --> 06:33.070
I don't know.

06:34.096 --> 06:36.939
In order to use it for the movie.

06:36.959 --> 06:37.540
For the movie.

06:39.382 --> 06:46.590
It is the only memorabilia that I could have.

06:46.630 --> 06:47.751
Who did this for you, Ewa?

06:47.771 --> 06:48.672
Who did that for them?

06:49.813 --> 06:50.714
I think half.

06:50.834 --> 06:51.215
Photos.

06:52.115 --> 06:53.097
That's perfect.

06:53.197 --> 06:54.578
Yeah, that's magnificent.

06:55.479 --> 06:56.300
That is real.

06:56.520 --> 07:02.787
Oh, that's the little... So they copied probably because it is great.

07:03.627 --> 07:08.773
So that has been done professionally, professionally well.

07:08.813 --> 07:10.816
This is real Greek.

07:10.996 --> 07:12.738
I have to put it almost in.

07:12.758 --> 07:19.326
So you copied some from some manuscripts.

07:19.627 --> 07:23.532
Can I take your picture with Mr. Eko?

07:23.732 --> 07:26.856
Or maybe any pictures with you?

07:26.876 --> 07:29.399
About phase and hyper-reality.

07:29.619 --> 07:32.723
My wife is going to take my picture with you, Mr. Eko.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.902
Just look at it.

07:37.003 --> 07:39.306
This is the most beautiful book of the world.

07:40.287 --> 07:40.868
Of the world.

07:41.248 --> 07:41.509
Yes.

07:42.830 --> 07:43.611
To my copies.

07:43.851 --> 07:46.094
The Hypno-Automachia Polyphile.

07:46.114 --> 07:46.254
Ah.

07:49.818 --> 07:50.839
Oh, that's wonderful.

07:54.283 --> 07:58.248
It is not a good copy because there are copies.

07:58.328 --> 08:00.371
So this has been trimmed a little bit.

08:01.332 --> 08:03.334
And how old is this?

08:03.719 --> 08:05.482
1499.

08:07.945 --> 08:24.729
But when I speak of the beautiful paper, you have, look, this is a great book of the Renaissance that I found for ten times less its value.

08:24.749 --> 08:27.253
That always makes you feel good, doesn't it?

08:27.273 --> 08:28.494
Yes.

08:28.514 --> 08:32.460
But it is the 16th place.

08:33.098 --> 08:34.480
Look at the paper.

08:38.805 --> 08:41.468
It looks as print.

08:41.488 --> 08:42.329
Magnificent.

08:46.314 --> 08:52.602
That is unbelievable.

08:55.225 --> 09:02.194
But, the Santa Agustin, I mentioned you, which has 50 years

09:02.647 --> 09:10.860
more, you can do with the original.

09:11.040 --> 09:12.442
Oh, that's the binding, right?

09:12.482 --> 09:13.143
And the class.

09:13.243 --> 09:14.045
And we have a problem.

09:14.065 --> 09:17.550
We made this.

09:17.570 --> 09:28.367
It is not only entirely complicated until the end, which is very handy, but there is a text and a commentary.

09:28.668 --> 09:36.459
So, according to the length of the commentaries, there is a lot of tests, and there is a less test, text and more commentary.

09:37.019 --> 09:42.647
All the commentary, there are things in which the commentary is... Yes.

09:42.767 --> 09:47.995
So, every page is a different typographical invention.

09:48.415 --> 09:49.316
Ah.

09:49.336 --> 09:53.202
And, even in this case... Look at how he's handling it.

09:53.943 --> 09:55.505
Look at the paper.

09:55.545 --> 09:56.807
Whose annotations are they?

09:56.827 --> 09:58.489
Do we know who he... Yes, it is...

09:59.363 --> 10:02.426
49 years old.

10:03.707 --> 10:11.714
That is unbelievable.

10:11.734 --> 10:14.156
507 years old.

10:16.157 --> 10:18.219
And look at the paper.

10:18.700 --> 10:20.381
What does this say on the spine?

10:20.882 --> 10:21.402
Not the spine.

10:21.442 --> 10:28.408
In the usual monastery they wrote probably

10:28.827 --> 10:31.791
only they were kept like these.

10:31.991 --> 10:34.815
So that was a way of shelving it, cataloging it, or whatever.

10:35.336 --> 10:36.557
And where did the book come from?

10:36.617 --> 10:37.539
Do you know?

10:37.919 --> 10:38.840
The provenance of it?

10:40.002 --> 10:44.268
No, I don't think so.

10:45.730 --> 10:48.153
I just want to write down the title of it, too, if I can.

10:50.476 --> 10:56.264
No, but I was mentioning you and writing these parathesis.

10:56.324 --> 10:57.045
Look, look,

10:57.363 --> 11:12.779
The beauty of the note, the way the book has been worked about, worked by work.

11:13.139 --> 11:17.744
Can you tell anything about the reader, the person, the reader whose annotations leave that?

11:17.844 --> 11:18.084
No.

11:19.585 --> 11:27.133
No, because there is no possession mark.

11:27.518 --> 11:31.323
No, but does it tell you something about him as an individual beyond his identity?

11:32.325 --> 11:39.374
An alchemist.

11:39.595 --> 11:47.706
An alchemist.

11:48.868 --> 11:53.153
When they would write, would they write their observations from their reading or are they ideas?

11:53.434 --> 11:55.737
Are they interacting with the text?

11:55.902 --> 12:01.608
Certainly, sometimes correcting it, sometimes elaborating it.

12:01.748 --> 12:12.138
But you see, now the writing is probably of the same time.

12:15.662 --> 12:17.284
What is the title of this book?

12:17.404 --> 12:18.325
What do we call it?

12:18.465 --> 12:22.949
It's one of the volume of the complete works of Panacelsus.

12:23.029 --> 12:25.572
I'm sure the title page is just like that.

12:25.906 --> 12:36.518
Ex Bibliotheca Christophori Stimuli.

12:36.538 --> 12:38.220
Oh, so we do have it in there.

12:38.500 --> 12:40.142
There is a provenance, yes.

12:40.162 --> 12:53.778
Let me say I have some more news about... Ah, catalogs, card catalogs.

12:53.838 --> 12:54.799
This or this one?

12:58.492 --> 13:09.387
Ex Biblioteca Cristofori Stimeli.

13:11.590 --> 13:15.515
I just want to get a picture of the title page of the book in its original.

13:16.817 --> 13:19.420
I don't want to handle it myself.

13:26.538 --> 13:28.320
Can I just get a picture?

13:28.340 --> 13:33.708
Sometimes there are books in which you know who made the notes.

13:33.728 --> 13:38.514
Recently, I don't remember which one, which I did this.

13:39.736 --> 13:43.961
We know who was this time.

13:44.962 --> 13:46.605
And the copy.

13:49.188 --> 13:54.435
And I think it is well, this is Nukonabu.

13:55.782 --> 13:57.564
Very, very good copy.

13:57.624 --> 13:58.145
Beautiful.

13:58.305 --> 13:59.266
With the notes.

14:01.269 --> 14:21.495
And according to my information, the notes, signature on title and annotation of the Polish opposition and book collector Peter Wedecki, born in the second half of the 15th century.

14:21.515 --> 14:22.937
He studied in Krakow.

14:23.693 --> 14:41.055
I don't know which reasons it was possible to retrace the owner.

14:41.075 --> 14:46.442
In this case this is called possession mark of a certain one.

14:46.462 --> 14:48.064
Obviously it was something

14:53.714 --> 14:55.877
Beautiful.

14:55.897 --> 14:56.277
Lovely.

14:56.818 --> 14:57.439
Beautiful notes.

14:57.639 --> 14:58.740
And look at the engravings.

15:03.186 --> 15:10.075
That was an astronomy.

15:10.335 --> 15:22.371
And look at the... Can I just get a picture of the title page of this one here, the big one, the folio?

15:24.697 --> 15:26.279
We talked quite a bit about that.

15:26.319 --> 15:31.406
This is difficult because there is a complete handwritten.

15:31.766 --> 15:32.547
Yes, that's wonderful.

15:33.008 --> 15:47.927
Complete handwritten.

15:47.987 --> 15:49.830
Great.

15:49.850 --> 15:50.671
This has been wonderful.

15:52.794 --> 15:53.134
Thank you.

15:54.447 --> 15:55.228
Thank you so much.

15:57.891 --> 16:10.483
You know that Alexa always likes to share, to show, because there are not so many people interested.

16:10.503 --> 16:13.186
And you have some lovely maps, of course, that must come.

16:13.226 --> 16:16.269
Did you get these for the new book, the last novel?

16:16.289 --> 16:19.813
Yeah.

16:20.030 --> 16:38.769
The description I gave on the island of the day before of the disease of the valley, it was a description exactly of that man.

16:39.169 --> 16:41.271
We love that book.

16:41.391 --> 16:46.797
My wife read it before I did, as a matter of fact.

16:47.197 --> 16:49.159
Yes, I bought some

16:49.477 --> 16:52.720
maps of that time.

16:52.740 --> 17:16.204
This war rest is of the same map of Coronelli, about, yes, my place was here, and he found here this precise antipode of Venice.

17:16.224 --> 17:17.185
How old is that map?

17:17.205 --> 17:19.247
That must be... Coronelli.

17:20.088 --> 17:24.954
Yes, yes, that's the way it's 400 years old.

17:24.974 --> 17:37.391
The problem is to find the real one, but the real one is dead.

17:37.691 --> 17:48.846
And probably the real one is completely in color, but you know there is a piracy

17:49.552 --> 17:59.707
Because a bookseller who has this, he can sell it for, let's say, $100,000.

18:00.448 --> 18:05.715
But if he says the separator, it takes double.

18:06.036 --> 18:06.757
More than double.

18:09.601 --> 18:16.150
Oh, now there is another side of the book, Technology, which is...

18:20.028 --> 18:47.217
this is the book of cares you have it in Dublin I calculated that no human being can see it completely because they open two pages every month so your life is not enough that's now the anesthetic made by laser art of a total perfection they look

18:48.040 --> 19:02.002
Look, Le Travicheur de Luc de Berry, another book that if you are not Mr. Panofsky, Mr. Gombrich, two, three persons in the world, you cannot touch it.

19:03.123 --> 19:10.254
But the anesthetic, you see, you feel the gold.

19:11.536 --> 19:15.162
To touch here, you feel the gold.

19:15.698 --> 19:18.841
And they are reproducing even the wormhole.

19:19.562 --> 19:21.604
Oh no, they did, they did.

19:21.745 --> 19:25.108
All the transparencies of the... They did.

19:25.128 --> 19:26.510
So it's possible, finally.

19:26.870 --> 19:33.818
In fact, everybody knew of the treasure of those images that are in every calendar.

19:34.639 --> 19:41.166
But the discovery of the rest is absolutely a discovery for a common person.

19:42.125 --> 19:45.991
Now they cost a fortune, they too.

19:46.031 --> 19:47.072
What is this book again?

19:47.153 --> 19:47.894
I missed the title.

19:48.034 --> 19:51.179
Les Très Richeurs du Duc de Berthe.

19:51.219 --> 19:52.140
Oh, that's the Duc de Berthe.

19:52.160 --> 19:53.322
Yes, every word you find.

19:54.664 --> 19:57.188
They made the complete anesthetic.

19:58.169 --> 20:04.819
Then a critical volume made by the greatest scholar in this field, the experience.

20:04.839 --> 20:08.605
And they have a market.

20:09.901 --> 20:13.746
I get them free.

20:13.766 --> 20:16.750
They want you to see them?

20:16.770 --> 20:17.872
You earn them, sir.

20:18.413 --> 20:19.214
You earn them.

20:19.594 --> 20:20.275
You have earned them.

20:20.415 --> 20:24.401
No, they ask you maybe to make a blurb or something like that.

20:24.922 --> 20:27.545
But this now goes like the original.

20:27.745 --> 20:31.611
Well, the British Library is doing a thing they call turning the page.

20:31.651 --> 20:34.795
They're going to do digital images of the Lindisfarne gospel.

20:35.062 --> 20:38.485
And so you'll be able to actually turn the page and see everything.

20:38.525 --> 20:40.587
But this is a real industry.

20:40.708 --> 20:42.169
There are the Spaniards.

20:42.189 --> 20:43.230
There are many.

20:43.570 --> 20:45.572
Those are Swiss.

20:45.592 --> 20:47.895
And according to me, they are the best.

20:48.635 --> 20:51.698
They make, let's say, 800 copies.

20:52.359 --> 20:55.842
These codes now, $30,000 or something.

20:55.902 --> 21:00.507
They sell it to the great libraries.

21:00.527 --> 21:01.228
$30,000 for that?

21:02.088 --> 21:02.969
Yes, I think.

21:02.989 --> 21:04.731
And now it's $30,000.

21:05.217 --> 21:05.618
Wow.

21:07.120 --> 21:08.982
I repeat, I didn't know.

21:09.103 --> 21:10.905
No, that's not necessary for that.

21:10.925 --> 21:21.180
What do you think of somebody like Bill Gates, who's putting the billionaire, who's putting on the walls of his new house these screens that he can see the great paintings?

21:21.200 --> 21:21.440
Yes.

21:22.582 --> 21:24.986
But, okay.

21:25.506 --> 21:31.014
He was a poor man and has no other chances to have one cigar.

21:31.074 --> 21:32.577
They are my facsimiles.

21:32.897 --> 21:34.279
You can have a good...

21:34.968 --> 21:36.130
reproduction.

21:36.390 --> 21:44.924
His naivete is maybe that he believes that it will substitute the real gallery.

21:44.944 --> 21:45.885
That's wonderful.

21:45.905 --> 21:56.922
Then why she spent so much money for the Leonardo O'Connor since he could have his reproduction.

21:56.942 --> 21:59.366
It makes honestly a difference.

21:59.627 --> 22:03.152
I would like to have in my little room every

22:03.554 --> 22:26.693
the night the different images and the uh the case i love the case maybe just echo here by the case yes okay

22:36.241 --> 22:37.002
Thank you.

22:37.803 --> 22:38.463
This dancer?

22:39.044 --> 22:45.310
And I'm going to come in close.

22:46.251 --> 22:47.532
Thank you.

22:47.552 --> 22:49.274
What?

22:49.294 --> 22:49.955
That's wonderful.

22:52.717 --> 22:56.321
I can't believe it.

22:56.341 --> 23:02.487
We've taken about this whole thing.

23:02.567 --> 23:03.568
It's not lit yet?

23:03.628 --> 23:06.231
Maybe on our way out we'll see it.

23:06.447 --> 23:14.335
But we are very happy because we discovered that the leaves look like Vermont.

23:14.395 --> 23:22.484
This year we have an immediate passage from summer to winter.

23:22.925 --> 23:24.707
And it seems that it's worked out.

23:24.727 --> 23:27.049
The leaves, they look like in Vermont.

23:27.109 --> 23:30.292
I was telling my wife today, I said, look, I have a fall here this year.

23:30.713 --> 23:31.434
But this is unusual.

23:31.654 --> 23:32.215
Unusual.

23:32.235 --> 23:34.617
Unusual to have those colors.

23:35.138 --> 23:35.458
Absolutely.

23:36.282 --> 23:37.003
Yeah, really.

23:37.443 --> 23:38.304
Yellow.

23:38.324 --> 23:44.871
That is like an Indian... No, the East Coast.

23:44.911 --> 23:47.814
The red leaves of the East Coast.

23:47.834 --> 23:49.556
No, it's not usually the East Coast.

23:49.576 --> 23:52.019
Oh, we thought it was typical because it was so pretty.

23:52.039 --> 23:53.320
You had golden colors.

23:54.281 --> 24:00.407
There was a sudden passage that produced this result.

24:01.248 --> 24:02.710
We were lucky enough to see that.

24:02.750 --> 24:03.731
This is beautiful.

24:03.751 --> 24:04.872
It reminded us of home.

24:05.138 --> 24:34.690
so this is a case of where we we hear something that was by looking at it looking at what it was without having any real conception of what it is or what it might have been i don't know maybe they're not expressing it they look at the last supplement

24:35.834 --> 24:42.144
I would like to see if it's a theater, because I've never seen it.

24:42.184 --> 24:42.807
Okay, thank you.
