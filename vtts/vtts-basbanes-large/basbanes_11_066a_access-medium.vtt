00:02.748 --> 00:09.216
We're talking to Michael Keller at Stanford, and you just said something to me about I should talk to who else.

00:09.236 --> 00:18.667
With regard to the National Library in Sarajevo, you should speak with Tanya Lorkovic, who's the Slavic Studies Curator at Yale University Library.

00:18.787 --> 00:19.208
At Yale?

00:19.628 --> 00:19.889
Yes.

00:20.029 --> 00:20.429
Oh, great.

00:20.569 --> 00:27.017
She's responsible for the librarians who are going to be helping to rebuild that library.

00:27.177 --> 00:31.843
She's a curler herself, and brilliant, wonderful,

00:32.212 --> 00:35.657
well-known, well-traveled, sensitive person.

00:36.098 --> 00:36.739
Absolutely the right person.

00:36.759 --> 00:39.063
You wouldn't know off the top of your head how to spell her name.

00:39.464 --> 00:40.766
O-R-K-O-V-I-C.

00:42.488 --> 00:45.633
And it's... Do you know what department she's in?

00:45.693 --> 00:49.980
Yeah, she's in the library, in the Sterling Library in the Slavic Studies.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.446
She's down last week with Harold Bloom.

00:53.526 --> 00:56.851
I'm entering the canon debate as well.

00:57.392 --> 00:59.215
The other person you should speak to is...

00:59.988 --> 01:12.541
Professor Ival Banat, B-A-N-A-C, who is the professor of history at the Central European University in Budapest, and a professor of history at Yale University.

01:13.142 --> 01:20.609
Banat is also a co-op, but very much involved with library matters and quite, quite smart.

01:21.470 --> 01:28.257
And I'm lucky in a way, I wish there had been more press on it to help it, but there's been very little press on this.

01:28.608 --> 01:31.252
There's been something in the New York Times in the last couple of months.

01:31.272 --> 01:33.375
Just on the fourth anniversary, scant.

01:33.976 --> 01:34.877
Not a whole lot.

01:34.897 --> 01:36.379
An inside story, really.

01:36.399 --> 01:37.761
An inside story.

01:37.781 --> 01:42.568
So, I mean, you've certainly... I was having Bill Lees as a friend.

01:42.628 --> 01:43.710
He's great.

01:43.990 --> 01:46.894
I was hoping he'd be here for the Inner Korean Book Fair.

01:46.914 --> 01:48.657
He was here last time, but he didn't come.

01:48.677 --> 01:50.860
I didn't see him.

01:50.880 --> 01:51.360
I didn't see him.

01:51.380 --> 01:52.081
Where was he?

01:52.101 --> 01:53.704
Saturday morning while I gave a talk.

01:54.004 --> 01:56.708
He was staff friends at the Stanford Library, and he was there.

01:57.194 --> 02:03.520
And I told them when I was coming down to the city, you know, this is great, Yale, you know, tell them that.

02:03.540 --> 02:04.641
And they said very nice things.

02:05.142 --> 02:21.477
Well, you certainly have been talked about, you know, you are certainly, when people talk about philosophies of libraries, of the future, the plug-in library, all this, there's even a quote that's been attributed to you, rightly or wrongly, if you can't plug it in, I'm not interested.

02:21.517 --> 02:23.139
That's absolutely untrue.

02:23.159 --> 02:24.540
Not an accurate quote.

02:24.560 --> 02:26.442
I don't think I've ever said that.

02:26.658 --> 02:30.342
So is there a quote that even comes close to that?

02:31.563 --> 02:32.944
Why don't I try to give you a sound bite?

02:32.964 --> 02:34.346
Let me talk about what I'm up to.

02:34.406 --> 02:38.430
And that will allow us to enter the conversation.

02:38.450 --> 02:44.095
We're in a kind of ironic situation in the great research libraries of the country.

02:45.397 --> 02:51.703
On the one hand, there are more and more books to attract our interest.

02:52.730 --> 02:57.736
And the fact that there are more books results from the fact of information technology supporting publishing.

02:58.377 --> 03:06.506
So now suddenly people with fairly low investment in technology can bring out what looks like a credible book.

03:06.586 --> 03:09.990
Whether the content is credible or not is something else.

03:10.391 --> 03:16.198
But suddenly publishing is no longer an arcane and difficult thing for people.

03:16.658 --> 03:20.543
So a lot of niche publishers and a lot of governments are putting out a lot more than they ever put out before.

03:24.387 --> 03:52.740
We have more and more books to select from, more and more materials for scholarship to navigate amongst in print, while simultaneously we have the opportunity and, in my view, the responsibility to deliver to our faculty and student clientele, our readers,

03:53.733 --> 04:01.761
the materials that they most use and most want on the net seven days a week, 24 hours a day.

04:02.802 --> 04:20.398
So it's an ironic situation because in both cases, information technology and the Internet have had an enormous impact on the production of new books, print on paper, new journals, new documents, new statements, new great literature, all that stuff.

04:21.020 --> 04:35.142
and simultaneously has produced a lot of other sorts of material which is really partly a kind of parody or mimic of the print world and partly a whole new information domain altogether.

04:36.004 --> 04:48.343
And from my perspective, a professional in research librarianship, which has been in my trade for a very long time now, is to provide to the readers, to the scholars and students at our place and our places,

04:48.897 --> 04:55.225
the information in any genre, any format, any medium that is relevant to their work.

04:55.265 --> 05:00.412
There's several different axes of consideration.

05:00.452 --> 05:07.420
One is a chronological axis, one is a genre axis, one is a format axis, one is a rarity to commonality axis.

05:08.101 --> 05:16.592
As far as I'm concerned, source material for scholars, students, runs the gamut from pre-ancient

05:17.264 --> 05:27.678
ancient cuneiform tablets and papyrus fragments and so forth, right forward to material that will never see ink on paper, but it will only exist in bits and bytes on a network somewhere.

05:28.580 --> 05:31.764
That's the intellectual world.

05:32.145 --> 05:42.619
Are you suggesting also that there's a co-equal, are you placing co-equal weight on all of these areas?

05:42.659 --> 05:42.799
No.

05:43.060 --> 05:45.162
Are you tilting towards the technology?

05:45.403 --> 05:45.583
No.

05:46.120 --> 05:48.302
We place the emphasis on content.

05:49.583 --> 05:59.373
The choices we make are based on the relevance of the content to the programs or the programs to be at Stanford.

05:59.993 --> 06:02.055
For that matter, for the whole research community.

06:02.116 --> 06:09.002
Our principal emphasis is on what is important for Stanford students and faculty and what is an opportunity for them.

06:09.803 --> 06:16.009
In truth, we are interpreting what we hear from them and know of them.

06:16.445 --> 06:38.093
It is also true that this context, the Stanford context, is a whole lot more wired up and technologically engaged than lots of other research university contexts, partly because of Stanford's enormous engagement, investment, and relationship to Silicon Valley.

06:38.113 --> 06:45.422
So what happened here after the Second World War and the building of a great university

06:45.875 --> 07:07.240
great in engineering, which has fed lots and lots of technologists down into Silicon Valley and like places, but also a great medical school and a fantastic law school and arguably one of the best business schools in the country and a superb humanities and sciences school and greater sciences and environment, environmental studies school.

07:07.841 --> 07:15.510
Each one of these have had an influence on the way we think about what we do as the principal

07:15.811 --> 07:19.637
you know, academic support unit of the university.

07:20.258 --> 07:22.201
So we spend a lot of time thinking about content.

07:22.702 --> 07:30.675
We spend a lot of time thinking about how convenient it is, it might be to provide one resource or another on the net.

07:31.576 --> 07:34.741
We spend a lot of time balancing costs and investments.

07:36.284 --> 07:42.173
We also, I think, have to, I've lost my chance of thought there,

07:45.781 --> 07:52.046
Part of the problem with this whole business is that of acceptance.

07:52.507 --> 08:15.687
And what we've discovered is that the scholars at the leading edge of a discipline, who tend to be the younger ones and the most influential ones, so it's an ironic contrast, the graduate students and the young assistant professors and the Nobel laureates and the Nobel laureate equivalents in all disciplines tend to gravitate to the

08:15.903 --> 08:27.897
the new methodologies, the new source materials, the new methods that can be used to extract value and knowledge from source materials.

08:28.638 --> 08:34.044
So they tend to be interested and have influenced the course of all disciplines.

08:34.064 --> 08:39.430
I say that without qualification, there is virtually no discipline that has not been influenced by information technology.

08:40.391 --> 08:43.615
So they tend to influence what's going on in disciplines.

08:43.983 --> 08:52.114
Because we follow the disciplines, both as practiced here and as practiced globally, we cannot help but be invested in information technology.

08:52.695 --> 09:05.191
Now, as it happens, for a very long time, in fact, for the moment I stepped into librarianship, there has been a continuous investment in the use of information technology to improve the service that librarians provide to their readers.

09:05.732 --> 09:12.741
It started off with the work of Fred Kilgore at the Yale Medical Library a long time ago.

09:12.923 --> 09:16.808
eventually migrating to the Ohio College Library Center to create OCLC.

09:18.350 --> 09:19.171
Which is essential.

09:19.832 --> 09:25.379
Well, what it turned out to be was the first of the bibliographic utilities, and it's the most extensive of bibliographic utilities.

09:26.220 --> 09:39.437
And when I was a junior G-man librarian in my first year on an acting contract at Sunny Buffalo, I was, because of the time, still a graduate student, of course, I was immediately sucked up into

09:40.126 --> 10:03.368
a decision-making group in the library as a representative of the very youngest generation to help make a decision about whether Southern Buffalo as well as four other universities in Upper New York State called the Foul Group, F-A-U-L, should in effect be the first group outside of Ohio to subscribe to the OCLC services.

10:03.848 --> 10:04.229
And we did.

10:05.770 --> 10:09.053
And as a result of that subscription, we got into the

10:09.353 --> 10:15.261
into avoiding redundancy of cataloging and classification efforts and therefore cataloging more materials.

10:16.022 --> 10:21.630
We got to building databases of bibliographic records, and ultimately we got the respective conversion.

10:21.690 --> 10:37.892
I participated in that decision-making about 10 years after that initial engagement, maybe a little less, to put our car catalogs, and despite what Nicholson-Baker says, those car catalogs as transferred are very robust

10:38.125 --> 10:40.828
reflections of what had been on the cards and more.

10:41.949 --> 11:04.970
As a result of that investment, the investment of online cataloging and classification and the retrospective conversion of card catalogs, these kinds of libraries are getting a huge increase in circulation because people can find more, more accurately and more quickly, and they can find materials of more relevance and more materials of relevance than they could formally just by flipping through the cards.

11:05.511 --> 11:06.732
Our circulation rates

11:07.454 --> 11:14.962
in terms of actual movement of materials out of the shelves and out of the buildings are generally up between 30% and 60%, depending on where you are.

11:15.843 --> 11:18.286
Certainly in this place they're up about 40%, 45%.

11:19.567 --> 11:21.069
No question about what the influence is.

11:21.730 --> 11:22.370
It's totally clear.

11:24.773 --> 11:36.426
In effect, the universities have gotten that much larger a yield from the capital investment they've made in these libraries, in these collections, as well as the processing and interpretation of the collections.

11:36.666 --> 11:37.427
It's a phenomenon.

11:37.610 --> 11:38.912
It's absolutely fantastic.

11:38.952 --> 11:39.693
You mentioned Baker.

11:39.833 --> 11:43.118
What's your take on this as an outsider?

11:43.458 --> 11:45.601
Well, I'm not really an outsider.

11:45.621 --> 11:55.615
I think that this whole thing is part of Nicholson Baker's general scheme to keep his name and his essays in the public eye.

11:55.955 --> 11:59.821
Of course, there's a new volume of the essays, which is just released quite coincidentally.

11:59.841 --> 12:07.431
That essay, that original essay in The New Yorker, offended a lot of people in the profession.

12:08.153 --> 12:18.729
It offended me a lot more because I knew he had information at hand, which he chose not to use because it did not fit his theory of what's going on in libraries.

12:18.829 --> 12:26.801
Well, he says, for instance, that the UC Berkeley retrospective conversion project did not transfer all the information off the cards onto the database.

12:26.821 --> 12:27.542
It's simply not so.

12:28.604 --> 12:29.485
It's simply not so.

12:29.545 --> 12:31.528
He did not report all the information that he had.

12:31.762 --> 12:35.387
He did not report all the good things that have happened as a result of retrospective conversion.

12:35.427 --> 12:36.208
That's why I would talk to him.

12:36.288 --> 12:37.710
You should definitely talk to him.

12:37.750 --> 12:41.336
These are things, if you think of questions you'd like me to raise to him.

12:41.476 --> 12:43.018
No, I don't need you to ask any questions for me.

12:43.158 --> 12:49.267
No, not for me, but I mean that you would like to see some of the... Then there's this gray irony of the San Francisco Public Library.

12:49.788 --> 12:55.035
He is taking energy and time away from a bunch of people who have a lot of very distinct things to do.

12:55.235 --> 12:57.259
as a result of building a fabulous building.

12:58.261 --> 13:03.071
That building is absolutely a mind-boggling, groundbreaking building.

13:03.091 --> 13:03.391
Why?

13:03.412 --> 13:14.053
Not because it's a highly wired building, though it is, not because they've provided a fair amount of extra shelf space and are finally getting more of their collection accessible to the public, which they are,

13:14.506 --> 13:17.690
but because the building itself is drawing masses of people in.

13:18.091 --> 13:19.553
It's a very attractive building.

13:19.573 --> 13:20.894
It's a community-building building.

13:20.975 --> 13:22.216
Public tours twice a day.

13:22.376 --> 13:24.259
Oh, it's unbelievable.

13:24.519 --> 13:41.161
And for this guy and his whole cadre of people that are really madly in love with card catalogs to go in and disturb, really disturb, the work that a small staff has got to cope with, they had no idea they were going to get so much traffic as they've gotten.

13:41.181 --> 13:42.403
Seems to me to be on a front.

13:42.535 --> 13:48.982
The guy isn't even a citizen of San Francisco, and yet he's over there doing business, trying to make trouble for these good librarians.

13:49.403 --> 13:51.525
Let him work on the Berkeley situation if he wants to.

13:51.545 --> 13:52.606
He's a citizen of Berkeley.

13:53.487 --> 13:55.549
I just find the whole approach annoying.

13:55.890 --> 14:04.900
The truth is that the San Francisco Public Library, the new one, and its leadership, starting with Ken Dallin, have done something that is quite brilliant.

14:05.480 --> 14:09.685
And it has to be experienced to be understood.

14:10.366 --> 14:11.547
They've built this.

14:11.932 --> 14:25.032
They built this building, which is an intersection of modern technology, very sensitively applied, wonderful collections, wonderful arrangements of collections in the building.

14:25.092 --> 14:38.293
They've encouraged community groups to become enmeshed in the program library, all kinds of community groups, gay, lesbian, Asian American, Hispanic American, Afro American, children, the whole thing.

14:39.404 --> 14:40.886
Their circulation rates are up.

14:40.906 --> 14:43.209
Their visitation rates are up.

14:43.289 --> 14:50.377
Ken is now turning his focus to expanding this engagement of the community and the library's programs to the branch libraries.

14:51.138 --> 14:52.700
It's a fantastic story.

14:52.720 --> 14:53.941
It's a very positive story.

14:54.001 --> 14:57.105
You think it's translated to literacy concerns as well?

14:57.185 --> 14:57.606
Absolutely.

14:57.626 --> 14:59.128
I mean, visitation is visitation.

14:59.648 --> 15:02.071
You know, for people like going to the zoo.

15:02.131 --> 15:04.534
No, I'm quite convinced.

15:04.574 --> 15:06.957
Their circulation rates are very much higher.

15:06.977 --> 15:07.858
That would be the measurement.

15:08.092 --> 15:09.073
That'd be one measurement.

15:09.534 --> 15:20.248
I think you have to wait some number of years and see how well the schools engage with the libraries, not just the main branch, but all the libraries, and maybe talk with a bunch of people and do some kind of systematic survey.

15:20.628 --> 15:28.258
My belief is that that building is such a positive atmosphere that it's going to have a major effect, not just in San Francisco, but all around the country.

15:28.278 --> 15:30.661
I think it's a brilliant exposition of what's possible.

15:30.681 --> 15:32.824
Have you seen the new Sybil in New York?

15:33.545 --> 15:34.306
No, I haven't been there.

15:34.326 --> 15:34.827
I've been to that.

15:34.847 --> 15:36.529
I had a wonderful interview with Paul McClare.

15:37.960 --> 15:40.302
I hear it's fantastic.

15:40.423 --> 15:42.865
It's great.

15:43.526 --> 15:45.048
Little places where you plug in.

15:45.208 --> 15:47.490
That's going to be true.

15:47.610 --> 15:49.953
But of course, they say that's why we set up that facility.

15:50.113 --> 15:53.877
You can still go to 45th Street, the main library.

15:53.917 --> 16:00.003
This is SIBL, Science, Industry, Business, and that's the function.

16:00.604 --> 16:03.847
We haven't even talked about generally looking ahead.

16:03.928 --> 16:07.191
The next millennium is hard upon us.

16:07.745 --> 16:10.970
And I'm concerned, you know, with the printed books, special collections.

16:10.990 --> 16:22.507
Let me just add, yesterday at the fair, I had an unplanned but quite rewarding interview with the new director of special collections at Berkeley.

16:22.527 --> 16:23.248
Charles Folliver.

16:23.268 --> 16:23.889
Yeah, I love him.

16:23.909 --> 16:24.490
Very nice guy.

16:24.510 --> 16:24.911
Good guy.

16:25.291 --> 16:30.218
And he says, you know, I, and when he said it, I was taking notes because, you know, we take this.

16:30.258 --> 16:30.980
This is pretty good.

16:31.681 --> 16:36.688
He doesn't think that Berkeley, the Bancroft Library, should be collecting printed books.

16:37.360 --> 16:45.128
He thinks that they should focus on unique things, manuscripts, and also digitizing them because they're precious and they're fragile.

16:45.889 --> 16:48.792
And he went on and on, but that was the thrust of what he said.

16:48.972 --> 16:52.376
What was your response to that?

16:52.596 --> 16:55.619
Well, I'm going to comment about our special collections program.

16:55.639 --> 16:56.320
I'm asking you to do.

16:56.340 --> 17:00.144
I throw that out as a... I admire Charles Feilhaber enormously.

17:00.164 --> 17:04.448
He's a very good scholar, and I believe he'll be just a brilliant director of the Bancroft.

17:05.255 --> 17:07.077
Our perspective is very similar.

17:08.458 --> 17:14.965
We have embarked upon a refreshment of our Special Collections program.

17:14.985 --> 17:24.734
From my first days here, we've bought more collections of unique materials, starting with Allen Ginsberg, but going also in all kinds of other directions.

17:25.976 --> 17:33.523
We've bought considerable collections of rare books.

17:34.398 --> 17:35.319
a few manuscripts.

17:37.262 --> 17:52.784
We're in the act of negotiating the gift of a major collection of commercially available software, but from the beginning of the revolution to the present time, in coordination with a museum.

17:53.304 --> 17:55.447
Will this be considered our special collection?

17:55.608 --> 17:56.829
Absolutely.

17:56.849 --> 17:57.771
That's pretty interesting.

17:58.011 --> 17:59.012
Why not?

17:59.032 --> 18:03.038
I mean, we have everything from cuneiform to stuff on diskettes.

18:03.338 --> 18:10.967
provided by, I mean, Robert Creeley's archive here has got material, drafts that he put on, that he did on diskettes.

18:10.987 --> 18:13.510
Why shouldn't we have this other information?

18:13.590 --> 18:14.751
It's just information, right?

18:14.771 --> 18:16.693
We're going up to Corbus tomorrow, by the way.

18:16.713 --> 18:18.175
We're going to spend two days up here.

18:18.195 --> 18:25.643
It's, I mean, if one is, if one allows one's vision of what a library is to be limited, then one is forestalling the future.

18:26.204 --> 18:29.428
In effect, you would prevent the library from continuing to be relevant.

18:29.448 --> 18:30.749
It would become a kind of museum.

18:30.849 --> 18:32.451
I guess it begs the question.

18:33.410 --> 18:34.591
How do you define a library?

18:34.751 --> 18:35.652
What is a library?

18:35.892 --> 18:40.056
Well, let me talk about what libraries do and maybe that would be my definition.

18:40.096 --> 18:41.958
Go anywhere you want with it.

18:41.978 --> 18:42.278
Okay.

18:42.298 --> 18:57.312
My belief is that libraries are cultural organizations that have multiple responsibilities, but they can be, in any library, they can be reduced to five or six different ones.

18:57.933 --> 19:02.337
One is libraries do selection.

19:02.907 --> 19:11.657
select among a very, very large corpus or corpuses to build collections of relevance to particular populations.

19:11.677 --> 19:16.243
And depending on the size of the library and the readership and so forth, you get these variations of what those collections are.

19:17.184 --> 19:20.207
Two, libraries organize that information that they acquire.

19:20.227 --> 19:25.293
And that information that they acquire may be physically owned and physically possessed, or it may not be.

19:25.313 --> 19:26.194
It may be on the network.

19:26.214 --> 19:26.835
It may be leased.

19:26.875 --> 19:32.121
It may be something that's not owned at all, but is reliably available, but it's somehow been incorporated into the library's

19:32.472 --> 19:33.693
sense of what its collection is.

19:34.114 --> 19:35.115
Two is they organize that.

19:35.135 --> 19:36.716
They catalog it and they classify it.

19:36.736 --> 19:39.940
They provide finding aids for materials.

19:39.980 --> 19:53.333
Increasingly, we're providing the kinds of access devices that allow readers using information technology to search for words and phrases, to search for dates, to search for geographical patterns and so forth, images.

19:54.735 --> 19:55.675
That's the second item.

19:55.736 --> 19:57.477
The third item is that we interpret the stuff.

19:57.597 --> 19:59.519
We provide the reference service.

19:59.539 --> 20:02.142
The same people who select the material

20:02.797 --> 20:06.661
and their colleagues in the reference services answer questions.

20:06.681 --> 20:08.002
They help people find the stuff.

20:08.022 --> 20:14.950
And it doesn't matter whether it's print on paper, the strokes of a piece of quill on clay or whatever.

20:16.031 --> 20:17.352
Thirdly, we circulate the stuff.

20:17.372 --> 20:18.313
We distribute it.

20:18.333 --> 20:21.677
We distribute it physically by circulation of books across the counter.

20:22.057 --> 20:23.338
We distribute it on networks.

20:23.358 --> 20:25.581
We distribute it in a variety of ways.

20:25.601 --> 20:27.643
Sometimes we do it by radio works.

20:27.663 --> 20:31.707
And lastly, we preserve the stuff, whether we're preserving it physically

20:31.906 --> 20:46.601
because it has artifactual value, and in a lot of cases, places like Stanford and Berkeley and Yale and Harvard do a lot of work to preserve artifacts because they have, the artifacts themselves are scholarly value.

20:47.062 --> 20:49.084
Well, I've been to the Harvard Supervisors.

20:49.104 --> 20:51.907
Well, it's not just storing them.

20:51.927 --> 20:55.591
I'm talking about washing them and cleaning them and re-silking them.

20:55.831 --> 21:01.457
But then we also preserve the content by microfilming them and scanning them and putting them into various other

21:01.825 --> 21:04.288
kinds of storage formats.

21:04.348 --> 21:12.479
The sixth one is kind of an odd one, and it's odd because at this library, there's a kind of new responsibility.

21:12.979 --> 21:15.222
My role here is to be university librarian.

21:15.803 --> 21:24.074
I'm also director of Academic Information Resources, which is the largest single piece of academic computing in the university.

21:24.094 --> 21:28.339
So I have tried very hard, and I've had a lot of help from a lot of good people,

21:28.893 --> 21:42.673
to merge the attitudes of service and function that librarians have with the attitudes and techniques and qualities of professional information technology in service of the academic processes.

21:43.434 --> 21:57.955
So we have this odd extra service and function here which is providing access to the tools and techniques of automation in service of teaching, learning, and research at Stanford.

21:58.829 --> 22:04.258
There are probably several different sub-disciplines there, but that's the overview of what we're really up to in this kind of a place.

22:04.278 --> 22:14.775
And I think at one level or another, that's true in almost all the research libraries in the country, whether they're public or private, whether they're associated with a university or not, whether they're a city library or a private library or whatever.

22:14.815 --> 22:17.539
At some level, that's going on in practically every place.

22:17.559 --> 22:26.153
I mentioned the Harvard Depository, the philosophy of Harvard, and I guess at Berkeley, UCLA, and many other places, many other places, other places.

22:26.842 --> 22:28.484
There's no such thing as a dead book.

22:28.524 --> 22:30.787
We all deaccession anything.

22:30.807 --> 22:33.111
Do you have a policy on deaccession?

22:33.631 --> 22:34.072
Do you do deaccession?

22:34.092 --> 22:35.474
We don't deaccession very much.

22:35.874 --> 22:45.888
When we have multiple copies for reserve purposes and N plus one copies, N minus one copies are not circulated anymore.

22:46.249 --> 22:49.793
Our selectors may choose to read the book, but we don't throw things away.

22:51.235 --> 22:53.038
Do you have a depository or repository?

22:53.078 --> 22:56.022
We have an auxiliary library that we had to build because of the

22:56.626 --> 22:58.588
damage to this building right here.

23:00.310 --> 23:07.518
When we finish rebuilding this building, we'll move much of that collection back in here, and that will be our depository library.

23:07.538 --> 23:13.864
But it's right on campus, and I believe very much in keeping Stanford's books on campus.

23:13.904 --> 23:18.950
That actually has a reading room out there, and we page books from it for readers two, three, four times a day.

23:18.990 --> 23:20.612
It's very accessible.

23:20.652 --> 23:25.637
Unlike the Harvard Depository, which has, because of the 13.5 million

23:25.735 --> 23:29.419
Yeah, and they also have no room in Cambridge to put one up.

23:29.519 --> 23:32.562
And they have 100 libraries all over the place.

23:34.744 --> 23:45.774
What's your philosophy on, I mean, you touched on it, but maybe you can articulate it on special collections, on acquiring special collections?

23:45.794 --> 23:54.983
My philosophy on special collections derives from my own work as a musicologist, where I use source materials in a lot of libraries in Italy and elsewhere.

23:55.840 --> 24:04.750
I believe that unique source materials bring a special quality to the educational experience.

24:05.651 --> 24:22.810
This notion was reinforced by my time at Yale, where the undergraduates at Yale were the largest single body of readers in both the Beinecke Library and the Department of Manuscripts and Archives, two of the largest but certainly not the only special collections at Yale.

24:23.296 --> 24:34.567
I believe very firmly that undergraduates and graduate students ought to have an experience with a source of unique value.

24:35.107 --> 24:47.059
So as I think about what makes Stanford's libraries distinctive and what makes the Stanford educational experience distinctive, I want there to be two things that are present there.

24:47.659 --> 24:49.641
One is I want every undergraduate

24:49.975 --> 24:55.943
and every graduate student for whom it's relevant to have an experience in our Special Collections department or among our Special Collections.

24:55.963 --> 24:57.906
And we, too, have some Special Collections in other places.

24:59.488 --> 25:08.120
I want them to have, I want their faculty to know that the undergraduates are welcome and that we have materials that they can use and rightly should use.

25:08.140 --> 25:13.567
Could you give an example of how an undergraduate could benefit from something like that?

25:14.008 --> 25:14.108
Sure.

25:14.128 --> 25:19.375
Let us take the Black Panther Party papers, the Huey Newton papers.

25:19.878 --> 25:32.411
There are undergraduate students in Afro-American studies working on the politics and social vectors in the mid to late 60s into the mid to late 70s.

25:33.512 --> 25:43.843
The Black Panther Party papers are brilliant source materials for kids interested in how African Americans try to take back some political power for themselves.

25:43.863 --> 25:48.147
And this particular set of papers illustrate a particular

25:48.650 --> 25:51.193
political parties attempt to do that.

25:52.033 --> 25:58.039
It's a fabulous way for these kids to understand the past, the recent past.

25:58.059 --> 26:00.121
It brings vitality to the thing.

26:00.181 --> 26:05.667
Music students should use Lully's scores to do a new edition of Lully.

26:05.927 --> 26:06.308
Why not?

26:06.668 --> 26:09.951
It's accessible and under the right conditions.

26:10.892 --> 26:11.873
L-U-L-L-Y.

26:12.013 --> 26:14.235
Jean-Baptiste Lully, 17th century.

26:14.896 --> 26:17.779
You guys won't have to flail over.

26:18.282 --> 26:24.549
So there's that one vector, and that's very much special collections, and that informs what we do in special collections here.

26:25.050 --> 26:40.107
So we try also to provide faculty with the grist for their research, and it's faculty in the humanities and sciences in particular that we try to serve, but we're also doing things in engineering with a history of science and technology.

26:40.468 --> 26:42.370
We're building collections.

26:42.530 --> 26:46.855
Collections that were started here a long time ago, we're now building onto them.

26:47.543 --> 26:53.376
Are there any areas where you would like to claim distinction for the university?

26:53.557 --> 26:56.103
Well, we absolutely have distinction in the history of science and technology.

26:56.243 --> 27:00.773
I mean, also to characterize your tenure, too, where you have gone.

27:00.793 --> 27:05.564
I've continued that vector, and as things go along, there'll be some things to be proud of.

27:05.604 --> 27:06.767
I can't announce the one that we're...

27:07.490 --> 27:13.876
We're two years away from publication on this.

27:14.056 --> 27:21.424
I suspect that by the end of the year I will have persuaded the Cabrinity family to give their materials to Stanford.

27:21.704 --> 27:26.829
Their son, who died prematurely, very young, had been a Stanford undergraduate for a couple of years.

27:26.909 --> 27:27.950
What's the name of the family again?

27:28.010 --> 27:28.731
Cabrinity.

27:30.332 --> 27:37.159
The father was a vice president with IBM and something of an entrepreneur.

27:37.426 --> 27:53.589
I don't know what the source of the income was, but the Sun essentially spent 10 years or 15 years of life building up this collection of 35,000 or 40,000 pieces of software.

27:53.989 --> 28:05.906
But with all the documentation, the packaging, and a whole herd of what has become gray literature of popular computing magazines of one kind or another that rose and fell.

28:05.966 --> 28:07.348
Some of them continued, some of them didn't.

28:07.666 --> 28:09.769
all kinds of books and so forth.

28:10.410 --> 28:34.281
They form a pretty thorough survey of what was going on in the commercial world where mass marketing of software... I would even come out to see this.

28:34.396 --> 28:38.501
We're doing it in conjunction with the Computer History Museum.

28:39.262 --> 28:44.248
The Computer History Museum?

28:44.569 --> 28:51.037
I think there'll be something open in a matter of a year and I'm hoping that I can persuade the university to put the museum itself in two years.

28:51.237 --> 28:52.399
We're publishing late 1999.

28:53.100 --> 28:54.301
You should talk to Glenn Bell.

28:55.002 --> 28:58.246
Glenn and Gordon Bell are the lead people in the Computer History Museum.

28:59.728 --> 29:00.469
Fabulous people.

29:00.769 --> 29:01.230
They're really

29:01.582 --> 29:03.365
This is interesting for me.

29:03.525 --> 29:10.435
Well, you see, what we've done is this history, science, and technology archive, and they have the capacity to take care of the software.

29:11.336 --> 29:15.703
So we're going to leave, by the way, let me interrupt, that something should be doing this, by the way.

29:15.723 --> 29:16.444
We're doing it.

29:16.464 --> 29:18.707
But we're not the only ones doing it.

29:18.727 --> 29:20.490
I mean, MIT is doing it.

29:20.510 --> 29:21.391
Makes sense.

29:21.672 --> 29:25.277
I think we're very strong in American literature, and especially American literature of

29:25.780 --> 29:28.323
of the post-war period, especially poetry.

29:28.363 --> 29:30.946
I also interrupted you of finishing the Cabrini thing.

29:30.966 --> 29:31.386
Cabrinity.

29:31.466 --> 29:32.007
Cabrinity.

29:32.147 --> 29:35.330
That collection, I hope... Can I spell that by the way?

29:35.350 --> 29:35.691
C-A-B-R-I-N-T-Y.

29:35.771 --> 29:36.291
Cabrinity.

29:37.172 --> 29:39.174
I probably left that an I on there somewhere.

29:39.415 --> 29:40.055
Okay, well, you know.

29:40.776 --> 29:41.777
Very interesting.

29:42.998 --> 29:45.461
It's not a done deal, but I think it's close to being one.

29:46.943 --> 29:47.924
It's a fabulous collection.

29:47.984 --> 29:49.806
Of course, you're trying to work it as a gift, too.

29:49.826 --> 29:50.827
It will be a gift.

29:51.167 --> 29:52.268
Whoever gets it, it'll be a gift.

29:52.328 --> 29:52.969
But I think we're the...

29:53.303 --> 29:57.568
the major one that they're considering because of the relationship to the Computer History Museum.

29:58.309 --> 30:05.418
And the Computer History Museum and the Stanford Libraries are going to interdigitate, in effect, so that we collect the archives... Did you invent that word?

30:05.498 --> 30:06.400
No, that's a real word.

30:08.823 --> 30:09.223
Freaks off.

30:09.343 --> 30:10.265
Interdigitate?

30:10.725 --> 30:12.848
Look it up.

30:13.068 --> 30:14.149
We're going to work together.

30:14.730 --> 30:22.500
Well, it has real meaning, because it's an articulation that has overlap and movement.

30:23.122 --> 30:25.765
I do invent words occasionally, but only occasionally.

30:25.806 --> 30:26.847
That may be one for all I know.

30:26.867 --> 30:29.330
There's only one person picked me up.

30:29.350 --> 30:30.892
Or the Samulsorium.

30:31.793 --> 30:33.075
I have no idea.

30:34.076 --> 30:34.617
I'll tell you what.

30:34.657 --> 30:36.019
It takes over as a cute story.

30:36.139 --> 30:40.124
Ask me to tell you two cute stories about the Blinker card catalog story, too.

30:40.265 --> 30:41.907
I've got personal experience with that.

30:42.508 --> 30:43.229
Go ahead.

30:43.970 --> 30:45.712
Okay.

30:45.732 --> 30:48.155
So there's the one, the science and technology.

30:48.175 --> 30:50.378
We continue to do a lot of collecting down the valley.

30:50.898 --> 30:52.080
We do oral histories.

30:53.001 --> 30:54.863
Now we're doing video stuff.

30:54.883 --> 31:08.542
We've got a project underway based on software we've written to store images of all kinds of source materials for students and faculty to use in that research project.

31:09.884 --> 31:16.393
We do a lot in American literature, especially American literature after the Second World War, and especially the more avant-garde of that literature.

31:16.433 --> 31:20.078
So Ginsburg fits into our Beat Poets collection, of which we had

31:20.429 --> 31:24.854
Robert Creeley and Denise Levertov and a bunch of others, both local and national.

31:26.636 --> 31:29.139
We have other American literature collections.

31:29.159 --> 31:30.561
Steinbeck is very big here.

31:30.581 --> 31:31.702
We have a fine Himalayan collection.

31:31.742 --> 31:34.105
Now we have the Soranian collection and many, many others.

31:34.886 --> 31:37.589
A little bit of controversy with some of these two letters, right?

31:37.649 --> 31:45.238
Well, Ginsburg was a controversial one because a lot of people on the conservative side of

31:45.927 --> 31:53.155
of culture in America and many in California felt that we were rewarding an anti-establishment guy by buying his stuff.

31:54.276 --> 32:01.984
But it turns out that Allen Ginsberg had some sense of himself as a historical figure from the time he was quite young.

32:02.845 --> 32:07.510
So he saved practically everything that had some intellectual value.

32:09.132 --> 32:11.034
And Soran has the same characteristic.

32:12.175 --> 32:13.977
And we have, as a result,

32:14.547 --> 32:25.824
a way of looking not just at the literary process and the creative process, but at the life of a creative artist from very early in their lives right through to the end.

32:25.924 --> 32:26.885
It's fabulous.

32:26.905 --> 32:27.586
It's an amazing thing.

32:27.606 --> 32:30.330
Was there some problem with Columbia untitled for this stuff?

32:30.350 --> 32:30.831
Columbia?

32:31.272 --> 32:32.574
With Ginsburg?

32:32.674 --> 32:32.934
Yeah.

32:33.695 --> 32:33.976
No.

32:34.837 --> 32:43.710
Ginsburg had given or sold material to Columbia, and there was some material on deposit there, but when it came down to it, Ginsburg decided that he'd rather place this stuff with us, so he did.

32:44.230 --> 32:47.113
And also the Sarayan material had a problem.

32:47.153 --> 32:48.535
The Sarayan was an interesting thing.

32:48.995 --> 32:50.737
Let me tell you a story as a precursor to that.

32:51.558 --> 32:53.420
And address it for the record if you'd like.

32:53.520 --> 32:54.661
I am going to address it for the record.

32:55.002 --> 33:14.102
About a year and a half ago, Wallace Stegner, who was a fabulous writer, American writer, based in the latter part of his life here at Stanford, the man who formed the creative...

33:14.892 --> 33:27.908
writing program here and was its first director and, you know, real sort of philosopher king, deposited at Stanford in the libraries his papers for a long time.

33:27.968 --> 33:30.051
He gave us some things, but he also deposited most of it.

33:31.052 --> 33:42.486
He was killed by an automobile accident, tragically, and way too young, near Santa Fe, and when his will was probated,

33:43.276 --> 33:48.802
It turned out that he'd given all his material on deposit at the Stanford Libraries to the University of Utah, his undergraduate school.

33:49.282 --> 33:57.011
Not because he was unhappy with the Stanford Libraries, but because he was unhappy with some of the things that Stanford had done after he had relinquished control of the creative writing program.

33:57.091 --> 33:57.992
At least that's what I've heard.

33:59.293 --> 34:05.400
His widow came to us and essentially said, we need this stuff to go to the University of Utah.

34:06.040 --> 34:06.681
They own it now.

34:06.721 --> 34:07.722
The will has been probated.

34:08.283 --> 34:09.084
Of course, I was new.

34:09.304 --> 34:10.465
I had no idea what was going on.

34:10.698 --> 34:12.500
So I quick got the deposit agreement.

34:12.680 --> 34:15.103
We have a contract with everyone who put something on deposit with us.

34:15.784 --> 34:24.614
And I quick got the probated will, and within a day, we could see that there was no place to go except to say to Mrs. Stegner, yes, ma'am, where would you like if they go?

34:25.215 --> 34:30.060
It was done in a matter of a week or two, the whole thing, including the delivery of the materials.

34:30.841 --> 34:33.424
Absolutely no resistance.

34:33.444 --> 34:37.589
Soran cases in outline are very similar to this.

34:39.191 --> 34:40.232
Soran, when he died,

34:41.191 --> 34:51.146
effectively disinherited his children and his ex-wives and gave his literary property, his naklas, to the Sorain Foundation.

34:51.246 --> 34:52.168
What did you call it?

34:52.208 --> 34:53.109
That's a German word.

34:53.169 --> 34:55.192
It means what remained of his life.

34:55.853 --> 34:56.835
How do you spell it?

34:56.855 --> 34:57.516
N-A-C-H-L-A-S-S.

34:58.457 --> 35:00.981
To the Sorain Foundation.

35:01.001 --> 35:06.971
And the Sorain Foundation had been established by him to take care of just this eventuality.

35:08.132 --> 35:09.274
It placed...

35:09.980 --> 35:19.568
as much of the Sororian literary archive as I could at the Bancroft Library, thanks to the relationship with Jim Hart, the... Legendary.

35:19.588 --> 35:22.211
Legendary, and really a wonderful guy.

35:22.231 --> 35:22.831
I knew him quite well.

35:22.871 --> 35:26.274
I worked up there for five years, and he and I did a bunch of prizes together.

35:26.815 --> 35:33.120
He was one of these San Francisco Blue Bloods with incredible collections.

35:33.761 --> 35:38.485
He was responsible for the Oxford Companion to American Literature,

35:38.549 --> 35:39.631
four or five editions.

35:39.711 --> 35:41.053
Which I find essential.

35:41.313 --> 35:41.854
Absolutely.

35:41.934 --> 35:43.536
The Companion to California.

35:44.197 --> 35:46.661
Brilliant, brilliant, but a grand seigneur.

35:46.841 --> 35:49.846
Not someone who's too much in the details of running the Bancroft Library.

35:50.086 --> 35:52.309
He was a collector.

35:53.571 --> 36:02.344
Material, 120-some-odd boxes eventually landed up on Bancroft's door, and they deselected some of it and sent it back into storage with the Soron Foundation.

36:02.885 --> 36:07.071
It had two or three different homes, the stuff that didn't get collected at Bancroft over in Fresno.

36:09.143 --> 36:14.331
Eventually, the president of the foundation decided that he was getting older, his board was getting older.

36:14.832 --> 36:21.402
There were some decisions that had to be made about the long-term care and promulgation of the Soraya material and legend.

36:22.043 --> 36:23.025
What would he do about this?

36:23.365 --> 36:37.547
He came to us and spoke to us, and as he was talking to us, he said he was considering us, establishing a separate library in the Presidio, placing the materials at Bankeroth, all of them,

36:38.253 --> 36:41.076
Placing the materials, all of them at the State Library of California.

36:42.218 --> 36:46.383
And there was mentioned the possibility of placing this stuff at the University of Texas, Austin.

36:46.403 --> 36:47.504
So there's a competition underway.

36:48.385 --> 36:49.126
Were we interested?

36:49.146 --> 36:50.828
Of course we're interested.

36:50.848 --> 36:52.730
Soroyan, great figure in American literature.

36:52.770 --> 36:54.773
How can we not be interested?

36:55.934 --> 36:59.198
I knew the stuff was on deposit at the bank, but I knew they didn't own it.

36:59.538 --> 37:02.261
And I knew that it was up to the owners to decide where they wanted to place it.

37:04.504 --> 37:07.888
He eventually made an offer to us, which I refused.

37:08.746 --> 37:09.467
Who's he?

37:09.487 --> 37:13.874
The president of the foundation, involving a lot of money from us to the foundation.

37:14.374 --> 37:15.196
Robert Satrakian.

37:16.598 --> 37:16.738
Okay.

37:17.079 --> 37:21.846
Very interesting man, and a very decent man, I think.

37:23.128 --> 37:26.913
Mr. Satrakian made this offer to us, you know, send us a lot of money, we'll send you the stuff.

37:27.234 --> 37:27.815
And I said, no.

37:29.077 --> 37:29.497
I said, no.

37:30.038 --> 37:37.369
We're interested in American literature, in truth, but I can't afford to spend this money on someone that doesn't have an active...

37:37.720 --> 37:39.302
advocate among the faculty here.

37:39.322 --> 37:43.226
We have no one working on Soroyan at the moment.

37:43.246 --> 37:45.288
But I said, so that's over.

37:45.509 --> 37:48.132
In six weeks, he came back to me and he said, Mike, we really have to make a deal.

37:48.212 --> 37:49.573
I want this stuff to be at Stanford.

37:50.134 --> 37:53.638
I have a lot of things I want to accomplish for Soroyan and with Soroyan's materials.

37:53.678 --> 37:55.400
I want to sit down and talk with you about what those are.

37:56.041 --> 38:00.225
So I sat down and talked with him, and several things have happened.

38:01.627 --> 38:07.153
We made an agreement that said Stanford would acquire the Soroyan collection, the archives,

38:07.640 --> 38:09.802
in toto, the literary archive.

38:09.822 --> 38:15.407
Stanford would store the household goods while the foundation decided what to do with them.

38:15.427 --> 38:17.048
They will insure them.

38:17.128 --> 38:22.553
Stanford would accept ownership of the intellectual property, so we now own the copyrights.

38:24.435 --> 38:36.145
Stanford would, with the income from the copyrights, manage the property, but also establish a writing price, which we're in the act of doing.

38:37.272 --> 38:44.461
Stanford would also promote literacy and promote reading and scholarship on Soroyan, which we were in the act of beginning to do.

38:44.481 --> 38:55.275
And we would do all these things in concert with the foundation so that the Stanford libraries and the foundation would create some operating committees to give us advice about what would be most effective in these various areas.

38:56.496 --> 38:57.718
So I didn't have to put any money out.

38:59.080 --> 39:01.983
Soroyan Foundation got to join all of its material in one place.

39:02.644 --> 39:03.565
Which mattered to them.

39:03.685 --> 39:05.087
Which matters to them enormously.

39:06.209 --> 39:06.469
And

39:06.837 --> 39:28.638
Because the Soran Foundation is a chartered foundation in the state of California, they decided that they had to go with this proposition to the Attorney General, which they did, to get his approval for the thing, and to the Supreme Court, which had probated the will, which gave the material, the ownership of the material, including the property, the intellectual property, to the foundation.

39:29.219 --> 39:34.884
So they went to the Superior Court of San Francisco and asked the court to approve the agreement, which the court did.

39:36.085 --> 39:36.726
They then...

39:37.111 --> 39:48.745
wrote a letter to the Bancroft, and I have to say that I did not see that letter before it went out, and in a very one-page kind of way said, look, we decided to place this stuff with Stanford, and they had no inkling this was coming.

39:48.765 --> 39:50.867
This is not the way I would have done it, but that's the way it happened.

39:52.009 --> 39:54.452
There proceeded to be a low-yield explosion.

39:54.472 --> 39:55.132
Yes, you can.

39:58.096 --> 40:05.785
And some very fine people who are not responsible for whatever the relationship was between the Foundation and Bancroft

40:06.305 --> 40:13.113
who came there only in the last year or two, Peter Lyman, the University of LeBron, my counterpart, and Charles Foulhaver, the head of the Bancroft, got enmeshed in this thing.

40:13.693 --> 40:18.599
And their lawyers got enmeshed in this thing, and our lawyers got enmeshed in this thing, and the foundation's lawyers got enmeshed in this thing.

40:19.119 --> 40:33.375
But in the end, the attorney general of the state of California said, look, you've got no case here, Berkeley, UC, because this material is owned by the foundation, and they have every right to do with their property what they want to do with it as long as it doesn't fly in the face

40:33.693 --> 40:36.376
of what Soroy himself would have done, as he said, in his will.

40:36.917 --> 40:42.504
And placing it at Stanford is a logical alternative to what situation it persists now.

40:42.624 --> 40:43.545
And you don't own the stuff.

40:43.565 --> 40:44.406
You have no interest in it.

40:44.426 --> 40:53.077
And by comparison, I could cite the case at Boston University with the Martin Luther King material, where the family wants to bring it down to Atlanta, but they say, guess what?

40:53.097 --> 40:54.899
The paperwork says he gives it all to BU.

40:55.700 --> 40:56.741
BU wins.

40:56.761 --> 40:58.664
You know, game, set, match, it seems to me.

40:59.304 --> 41:03.109
The reason I started the story with a Stegner thing was an example of what

41:03.578 --> 41:06.883
we did and what we do when such a situation arises.

41:07.184 --> 41:15.657
Now, it turns out that Jim Hart did not have a deposit agreement with the Foundation or with Sir Royan for this material that was on deposit.

41:15.677 --> 41:17.159
There was no contract.

41:17.179 --> 41:18.862
That stuff was just sitting there for all those years.

41:20.785 --> 41:27.476
So, but it does raise the delicate question, of course, of now what does this do with the relationship with sister universities?

41:27.576 --> 41:31.442
Well, of course, that was an item on the press, you know,

41:31.675 --> 41:35.642
How could Stanford do this to Berkeley?

41:35.702 --> 41:38.967
How could we affect the relationship?

41:39.067 --> 41:56.957
Our relationship with Berkeley has been based for a very long time on lots and lots of relationships between curators and bibliographers and disciplines, between circulation librarians, between reference librarians, between various administrators and so forth.

41:57.697 --> 41:58.899
rich relationship.

41:58.919 --> 42:12.156
I know in Boston, Cambridge, where I'm located, you know, they get together, well, we're collecting this, we aren't going to... Well, there was no such set of agreements at any high level.

42:12.697 --> 42:14.039
Or understandings, even.

42:14.119 --> 42:14.980
Or understandings.

42:15.200 --> 42:18.264
There's one on science and technology.

42:18.404 --> 42:19.566
Stanford's going to collect the valley.

42:20.167 --> 42:24.953
But beyond that, we can find no...

42:25.304 --> 42:52.594
recollection and i've talked to the people that were here before me about these matters and there's no recollection of any of that so a lot of this was sort of hype for the sake of this the case my opinion in the meantime by the way this was not this gentleman didn't even raise this no no we finally sat down and talked about this thing you have to realize two things charles falhaber is new to being head of the bankrupt library formerly he was a professor of spanish and portuguese he's a

42:52.979 --> 42:57.485
He's an expert, a real distinguished expert in medieval Spanish literature.

42:57.525 --> 43:02.832
In fact, he's sending me to the Columbus Library in Seville.

43:03.333 --> 43:04.394
He's great.

43:04.434 --> 43:07.498
He's a real bibliographer in that area.

43:07.779 --> 43:11.884
But he has no particular experience running a great, big, and important special collections unit.

43:12.445 --> 43:16.911
His colleague, Peter Lyman, who's the university librarian over there, came from USC.

43:17.617 --> 43:24.985
and he'd been at Berkeley maybe for two years, and I don't know how long he'd been a university librarian at USC, but his whole library experience is something, I think, under 10 years.

43:26.207 --> 43:31.553
And he'd been only at USC and then at Berkeley, and he'd been at Berkeley only less than two years when this whole thing broke.

43:33.335 --> 43:45.548
We had a couple people fairly new to their own situations and reasonably new to research librarianship, although Peter Lyman is very experienced and speaks eloquently and well for libraries, and you really should talk to him.

43:45.568 --> 43:46.189
He's a great guy.

43:47.198 --> 43:52.302
On the other hand, you have a bunch of people here that are sort of wizened and grizzled and palaced.

43:52.322 --> 43:53.363
I've been in these wars.

43:54.024 --> 43:57.167
I've been in situations where depositors... And they're turf wars, aren't they?

43:57.187 --> 44:08.616
Well, not only turf wars, but you get these arguments from the depositors and their heirs and legatees who think you haven't done right by the agreement, and battles are fought constantly in these places, constantly.

44:10.338 --> 44:16.463
You do the best you can with what you've got, and what you use are contracts, wills,

44:17.337 --> 44:21.422
Explicit agreements, recollected agreements, and all that you have.

44:21.442 --> 44:26.067
I mean, I think that the relationship between Berkeley and Stanford is just great.

44:27.028 --> 44:35.418
We finally had one of these sessions where someone says something and there's a five-minute waiting period while the next person decides what they want to say back.

44:35.638 --> 44:36.539
Went on for two hours.

44:37.120 --> 44:38.201
Very uncomfortable meeting.

44:38.602 --> 44:43.627
We got a lot of things out on the table that they had no idea of, and they got a lot of things on the table that I had no idea of.

44:43.848 --> 44:45.910
I found out about why they're so sensitive about this.

44:46.717 --> 44:52.245
From their position, this was an aggravation of their Armenian-American studies program.

44:53.026 --> 44:57.211
Well, it's true that Soroyan is an Armenian-American.

44:57.231 --> 45:05.283
There's not a whole lot about Soroyan, however, that in his writing is directed to Armenian matters, per se.

45:05.303 --> 45:06.164
He's an Americanist.

45:06.184 --> 45:07.666
He writes about American matters.

45:08.026 --> 45:14.395
He's an Armenian-American who had an interesting experience in this country, and I think, therefore, is worth looking at as an Armenian-American.

45:14.898 --> 45:17.702
But the thrust of our interest in him has to do with American literature.

45:19.224 --> 45:24.692
And I think you also touched on whether you could even state it.

45:24.712 --> 45:25.753
By the way, how much time?

45:25.773 --> 45:26.434
I've got 15 minutes.

45:26.514 --> 45:27.195
Okay.

45:27.215 --> 45:32.923
In terms of the 60s, is this an area that you've kind of staked out for yourself too?

45:32.943 --> 45:35.968
60s, 70s, absolutely.

45:36.328 --> 45:37.750
But not just the 60s and 70s.

45:37.770 --> 45:40.554
We won't just focus on those two areas.

45:40.574 --> 45:44.820
With the Hoover Institution, we're interested in the 20th century experiences of war and peace.

45:45.323 --> 45:48.366
and the various cultural vectors that arise.

45:48.406 --> 45:51.470
So we just participated with... And we're not talking about Tolstoy's novel.

45:51.510 --> 45:53.912
When you say that... No, we're talking about Pasternak.

45:53.932 --> 45:57.977
We just acquired Pasternak papers with them as a joint acquisition.

45:59.558 --> 46:01.280
We've got... Do you make money change stamps?

46:01.300 --> 46:01.620
Absolutely.

46:01.761 --> 46:04.764
And by the way, you do have money to make acquisitions.

46:04.824 --> 46:05.204
Yes, we do.

46:06.746 --> 46:11.071
Because it's suggested maybe you don't have money or you haven't... We have money.

46:11.091 --> 46:13.413
Are you not willing to spend money?

46:13.433 --> 46:15.195
No, we spend money...

46:15.783 --> 46:21.929
where it's relevant to spend money, but we first always try to see if we don't have a way of making another kind of a deal.

46:22.910 --> 46:29.076
And in many, many cases, we're quite persuasive in getting gifts.

46:29.096 --> 46:29.716
But we have money.

46:29.736 --> 46:36.062
We have income from various endowments that are intended to provide for our special collections.

46:36.342 --> 46:37.704
And I'm building that income.

46:37.724 --> 46:39.185
And how did Peshek make it here?

46:40.246 --> 46:40.607
How did that work?

46:40.627 --> 46:45.351
Oh, I think that story is best told by the people in the Hoover, but essentially there was a contact to the Peshek family.

46:46.478 --> 46:54.228
They've been doing a lot in the Soviet Union and Russia, and the family wanted some money, and they also wanted to be sure that the material would be in a safe place.

46:54.789 --> 47:06.784
And as you see this terrible transition to a kind of chaos in Russian society, you see the questions about where the library programs are going to persist.

47:07.785 --> 47:09.007
The libraries aren't getting paid.

47:09.127 --> 47:10.849
They don't have money to turn on the lights.

47:11.673 --> 47:13.215
replace the glass in the windows.

47:13.456 --> 47:14.157
What's going to happen?

47:14.297 --> 47:15.659
Let alone take care of the stuff.

47:15.879 --> 47:16.680
Well, yeah.

47:16.700 --> 47:24.091
But, you know, so I think various of these people are quite concerned about perpetual care and persistence of their material.

47:24.672 --> 47:34.085
So here we are in this great place with a lot of ambition and a lot of know-how, and fortunately a university that expects us to do this work.

47:34.706 --> 47:40.414
And can we, in the few minutes that we have left, again, I'm anticipating

47:40.529 --> 47:43.913
The 21st of the next millennium.

47:44.493 --> 47:45.174
Let's focus on that.

47:45.194 --> 47:47.697
Have you seen our High Wire Press material?

47:48.037 --> 47:48.958
No.

47:48.978 --> 47:49.078
Okay.

47:49.539 --> 48:01.852
About, just about two years, two and a half years ago, two years ago, we started something called the High Wire Press, which is an Internet.

48:02.533 --> 48:02.893
What word?

48:03.394 --> 48:07.218
High Wire, capital H-I-G-H, capital W-I-R-E press.

48:07.938 --> 48:10.401
It's a unit of the Stanford University Libraries.

48:11.005 --> 48:13.407
It has a web page.

48:13.447 --> 48:15.890
You can go to highwire.stanford.edu.

48:17.571 --> 48:28.142
Its intention is to, it has multiple intentions, but one intention is to improve scholarly communications, particularly in the hot sciences.

48:29.223 --> 48:40.354
Another intention is to provide an alternative as Internet publishing develops to the more or less monopolistic model of scientific publishing now, today, in the print world.

48:40.739 --> 48:45.505
journal publishing.

48:46.727 --> 48:58.643
We started with a full text, fully indexed version of the journal Biological Chemistry, which is one of the largest, the second largest journal in the world today, scientific journal today.

48:59.184 --> 49:00.926
They publish 800 pages a week.

49:02.508 --> 49:07.455
They publish something like five, seven thousand articles a year.

49:09.460 --> 49:13.744
They distribute their work to 7,000 subscribers, about half of whom are institutions.

49:14.846 --> 49:19.090
Their science was growing so fast, they had to go from 48 issues a year to 52 issues a year.

49:19.130 --> 49:30.162
They could see it growing, and they were worried that they would reach the four-pound limit of their mailing rate, which would put them in another mailing rate altogether.

49:31.103 --> 49:35.447
Frankly, they weren't reaching their readers away from North America rapidly enough.

49:35.928 --> 49:39.231
They were disadvantaged in their distant readers, basically.

49:39.515 --> 49:46.021
The most advanced of the editors thought that there was some new advantage to be gained by publishing on the Internet.

49:46.681 --> 49:48.983
So we proceeded to publish this thing on the Internet with them.

49:49.144 --> 49:50.104
We're co-publishers with them.

49:50.525 --> 49:52.146
And we did a joint venture to get it started.

49:52.607 --> 49:53.488
We shared in the risk.

49:54.148 --> 49:57.251
Having gotten it started, now we've created a kind of model.

49:57.771 --> 50:06.179
Well, six weeks after we got it started, the publishers of Science magazine, American Association for Advanced Science, came to us and said, we'd like to talk to you.

50:06.559 --> 50:07.480
Show us what you've got.

50:08.152 --> 50:14.999
We went down to Washington, showed them what we had, and what started to be a show-and-tell turned out to be a contract negotiation session.

50:15.600 --> 50:15.960
Science.

50:16.320 --> 50:16.681
Yeah.

50:16.701 --> 50:20.905
So we now have a partial text version of science on the web.

50:21.466 --> 50:24.109
That is, there are abstracts and summaries of most articles.

50:24.149 --> 50:25.991
Some things are complete, but most things are not.

50:27.792 --> 50:30.355
And that's been going on now for just about a year.

50:32.037 --> 50:34.159
And we're about... This is...

50:34.477 --> 50:36.839
nondisclosure stuff until the fact.

50:36.879 --> 50:47.430
In about a month, science will be a full-text version, and it'll be a subscription-only situation in January.

50:48.811 --> 50:51.654
The whole text of the articles and all the footnotes.

50:51.934 --> 50:53.556
It's on paper now.

50:53.596 --> 50:57.620
It's going to be on the Internet.

50:57.860 --> 51:04.146
On the 1st of August, we brought up a full-text, on-the-Internet edition of the Journal of Neuroscience.

51:05.189 --> 51:13.719
Today visiting us are the publishers from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the single highest impact journal in the sciences in the world today.

51:14.380 --> 51:16.903
We will bring up an Internet edition of their work.

51:17.324 --> 51:18.986
So this is where we're going?

51:19.667 --> 51:21.028
This is where we're going in some areas.

51:21.088 --> 51:22.370
How about the printed book?

51:22.930 --> 51:24.512
Well, you know, you're making a huge leap here.

51:24.793 --> 51:26.094
Let's talk about science.

51:26.555 --> 51:28.297
Well, you can read this, though.

51:28.537 --> 51:33.323
Science journal publishing is a peculiar publishing world where

51:33.742 --> 51:39.627
The time to print in the hot sciences needs to be as small as possible, but the refereeing process is key.

51:40.508 --> 51:45.312
So you've got to have the scientists review their own work, but you've got to do it in a quick way, and you've got to get the word out there in a quick way.

51:45.412 --> 51:48.815
So there's this competition, in effect.

51:49.396 --> 51:55.461
In addition, there are ways of making the communication process much more effective and vivid than print on paper can provide.

51:55.962 --> 52:02.888
We believe that journal publishing in the sciences, all the sciences, is where it's going to be, and we're taking it there.

52:03.053 --> 52:05.615
in competition with others, but also with others.

52:06.236 --> 52:09.138
And as soon as you get on, do you have a good computer at home or have access to one?

52:09.158 --> 52:11.720
I just got a Toshiba 720.

52:11.800 --> 52:13.282
And what's your link to the Internet?

52:14.082 --> 52:14.883
I have two.

52:14.903 --> 52:16.805
I go to Merck online in the local area.

52:16.845 --> 52:18.186
But it's 28.8 basically, right?

52:18.206 --> 52:19.707
Yeah, it's 28.8, yeah.

52:19.767 --> 52:20.428
Okay.

52:21.488 --> 52:25.972
If you've got some time sometime, I would like you to see this on a fast link.

52:26.092 --> 52:27.974
Okay.

52:27.994 --> 52:29.135
When do you have to be able to see?

52:30.276 --> 52:31.577
This afternoon.

52:31.597 --> 52:32.858
Maybe I could have someone show you

52:33.479 --> 52:38.363
what we're doing on somebody's terminal around here.

52:38.483 --> 52:39.865
No problem.

52:40.285 --> 52:45.790
If you give this, whoever I can find, an hour to show you what's going on, you'll see what's happening.

52:45.810 --> 52:52.676
We've got another 12 journals waiting to come up, and their contracts are negotiated and we're starting to work.

52:53.337 --> 52:59.462
We've just started work with the Stanford University Press, with the Grant Flamel Foundation, to bring monograph publishing to the web.

53:00.523 --> 53:01.444
We think as a new

53:01.711 --> 53:04.054
marketplace to be found for scholarly monographs.

53:04.715 --> 53:09.621
Realize that most university presses publish fewer than 1,000 copies of any scholarly text.

53:10.803 --> 53:12.745
That means that things are out of print almost immediately.

53:12.765 --> 53:13.626
And they cost a fortune.

53:13.646 --> 53:14.648
And they cost a fortune.

53:15.248 --> 53:16.330
What's a better way to do this?

53:16.350 --> 53:23.058
Well, you realize also that 40% of the publishing costs, whether it's journal or monographs, go to two things, printing and distribution.

53:24.100 --> 53:30.688
If you can take that 40% away, you ought to be able to lower the costs or improve the mode of communication or both.

53:31.495 --> 53:32.316
And that's what we're trying to do.

53:33.498 --> 53:34.519
And we're working on it.

53:34.539 --> 53:37.082
We've got some very interesting partners that are quite committed to this.

53:37.122 --> 53:37.803
Things like this.

53:37.883 --> 53:39.826
Novels, though.

53:39.846 --> 53:40.587
Absolutely.

53:40.767 --> 53:41.748
Novels, I think.

53:42.169 --> 53:43.430
On the other hand, big reference works.

53:43.510 --> 53:46.434
Have you seen Encyclopedia Britannica online?

53:47.095 --> 53:48.657
It makes it a usable document.

53:48.697 --> 53:50.099
The OED, for instance.

53:50.179 --> 53:50.799
OED.

53:50.860 --> 53:56.467
I'll have someone show you that, too, because we've got a very interesting reader we've developed locally that allows you to see a fact only in the page.

53:56.807 --> 54:00.692
Not just the Asky stuff, but the Fossum, the Bullface, and all the rest of it.

54:02.225 --> 54:06.710
I think we have to be very intelligent about this, and that means we have to make distinctions.

54:07.831 --> 54:15.460
I don't want to sit in bed at night, or in my chair at home, and read John Gillian on the screen.

54:15.700 --> 54:17.102
Have you ever read a novel on the screen?

54:17.643 --> 54:17.703
No.

54:17.723 --> 54:19.104
I don't know what soul has.

54:19.785 --> 54:20.005
I don't.

54:20.025 --> 54:26.713
But on the other hand, when I wanted to find out last night what was going on with this business about the card catalog attempts at the public library,

54:27.048 --> 54:28.190
I don't subscribe to the Chronicle.

54:28.210 --> 54:29.071
It's a lot of paper.

54:29.091 --> 54:30.453
I subscribe to the San Jose American News.

54:30.473 --> 54:31.234
It's a fabulous paper.

54:31.314 --> 54:32.376
They don't cover San Francisco.

54:32.737 --> 54:38.365
I went on to the GATE, which is the San Francisco Chronicle Examiner's website, did a search.

54:38.385 --> 54:42.632
I got four or five articles and two letters about the library.

54:42.692 --> 54:43.773
You wouldn't just search under it.

54:43.793 --> 54:45.436
I'd search under... Because I want to get crappy.

54:46.017 --> 54:52.887
I'd search under library, but with a limited time frame, because I knew when the issue arose, mid-August to mid-September of this year.

54:53.468 --> 54:55.992
And there were five or six things that I could get from the two.

54:57.136 --> 54:58.538
They have a little search engine that works fine.

54:58.558 --> 55:00.982
They have the Baker story in there, too?

55:01.763 --> 55:03.726
Yeah, he was in there.

55:05.128 --> 55:06.430
I guess we're almost done.

55:06.971 --> 55:08.714
What I'm saying to you is this.

55:09.415 --> 55:22.935
I think you have to help people understand that those of us who are doing interesting things with net publishing do not believe that there's not a place for print publishing.

55:22.955 --> 55:23.837
I am printing books.

55:24.317 --> 55:26.080
I have just printed a book on all segments.

55:26.431 --> 55:32.918
I have printed this much stuff in the last three years here at Stanford.

55:32.938 --> 55:33.840
I'll give you one of these things.

55:33.920 --> 55:37.884
Okay, good.

55:38.365 --> 55:39.166
A few things you buy.

55:39.186 --> 55:39.666
Can I have these?

55:39.686 --> 55:40.127
Absolutely.

55:40.227 --> 55:40.627
Okay.

55:40.647 --> 55:43.671
I can't give you the book report because it's very expensive, but I can show it to you.

55:43.691 --> 55:43.791
Okay.

55:43.811 --> 55:49.177
Can we have a copy of the Stegner?

55:49.518 --> 55:51.580
Talking about the Supreme Court thing.

55:51.600 --> 55:52.942
This is the book we just put out.

55:53.482 --> 55:55.545
Catching the Light, Remembering Wallace Stegner.

55:55.685 --> 55:55.965
Right.

55:56.215 --> 56:10.557
It's an essay that was published at the Air Review and then not read or published elsewhere by Wally, some photographs, and then I don't know how many, but a number of his students and people he influenced wrote appreciations.

56:11.478 --> 56:11.999
Beautiful.

56:12.019 --> 56:12.399
Beautiful.

56:13.561 --> 56:17.567
So I'm investing in both realms in serious ways.

56:18.068 --> 56:19.530
It's not all one way or all another.

56:20.131 --> 56:22.374
And Stanford is right with us.

56:22.775 --> 56:23.556
It's a community project.

56:23.576 --> 56:24.838
All these people staying around here.

56:25.190 --> 56:27.720
350 other people around here all working in the same directions.

56:28.644 --> 56:28.885
Thanks.

56:29.146 --> 56:30.130
We'll be in touch.

56:30.391 --> 56:33.664
Good.
