00:03.153 --> 00:11.503
Do they hope to rebuild that building?

00:12.104 --> 00:27.362
There's some controversy right now because there are some people who argue that it should be left a ruin like Coventry Cathedral as a memorial to the victims of the siege and others who say, no, you should rebuild it.

00:27.663 --> 00:30.426
Then there's the problem of if it's rebuilt,

00:31.030 --> 00:43.781
whether it is to resume its function as a library, for which it was not particularly well-suited in modern age, in terms of wiring and so forth, or to have it be some sort of cultural center.

00:44.522 --> 00:59.535
I don't know if you, sort of like the Boston Public Library, where you'd have a modern functional library, and then the older building used either as a research library or as a cultural function center.

01:00.933 --> 01:02.635
There's pictures of that, too.

01:03.116 --> 01:05.098
Well, I have to start with.

01:05.118 --> 01:08.743
You're going to remember to give me this gentleman's email address, right?

01:08.903 --> 01:09.644
Buck Ashutcher?

01:09.664 --> 01:13.089
Sure.

01:13.169 --> 01:19.697
I think I'll just compose a letter to him and let him know what I'm doing and rub this stuff, go back, transcribe the tape.

01:19.818 --> 01:21.940
No, it's after.

01:23.262 --> 01:24.864
The exterior is still a shell.

01:25.605 --> 01:26.306
It's still there.

01:27.247 --> 01:30.231
But...

01:32.168 --> 01:43.903
Although we originally started this whole business as a project for manuscripts, we kept getting information on various people doing very small things to help.

01:44.744 --> 01:48.529
And so we decided as long as we had a web page to try to coordinate that.

01:49.250 --> 01:57.862
And so we have a whole list of projects to which we're about to add a brand new one, which I'll also give you a printout of.

01:59.163 --> 02:02.007
James Carroll, who has a column in the Boston Globe.

02:02.830 --> 02:08.378
wrote a couple of really good articles on the National Library.

02:08.438 --> 02:27.505
One of his devoted followers has a small family foundation, you know, African Hill types, and was moved to make a $20,000 donation to the Sabre Foundation here in Cambridge, which has now started a book donation program from Bosnia.

02:28.008 --> 02:39.779
And we've got the president of Harvard University, Neil Rudenstein, involved, and he directed the Harvard University Press and the Harvard University Library to donate books through Sabre.

02:39.879 --> 02:40.839
And Sabre means what?

02:41.240 --> 02:43.142
Sabre is the name of the foundation.

02:43.162 --> 02:46.945
I have no idea whether it was originally an acronym or it means something.

02:49.948 --> 02:50.368
What else?

02:51.409 --> 02:53.831
And similarly, we have... S-A-B-R-E, right?

02:53.851 --> 02:54.071
Mm-hmm.

02:54.972 --> 02:55.973
All caps.

02:56.442 --> 02:58.044
Is it all caps?

02:58.064 --> 03:00.367
No, I think it's normal, you know.

03:01.188 --> 03:09.079
Big S, small A, B, R, A. Actually, his email address is right here.

03:09.620 --> 03:10.000
Oh, good.

03:10.381 --> 03:10.862
Oh, there it is.

03:11.102 --> 03:11.462
Excellent.

03:11.823 --> 03:12.985
Are you printing that for me?

03:13.005 --> 03:14.947
Yeah, I'm just printing that for you.

03:15.087 --> 03:16.449
How do you pronounce his name?

03:16.469 --> 03:17.210
Vakar Shich.

03:18.772 --> 03:22.317
There should be a little mark on the S and the C. Okay.

03:22.337 --> 03:22.998
Vakar Shich.

03:25.722 --> 03:25.842
Flash.

03:26.429 --> 03:29.072
Stuff by regular mail still is problematic.

03:29.092 --> 03:30.934
Sometimes it gets through.

03:30.994 --> 03:32.236
What's wrong with e-mail?

03:32.256 --> 03:34.699
It's instantaneous, isn't it?

03:34.719 --> 03:35.540
E-mail's good.

03:45.251 --> 03:47.313
He wrote this, which I thought was very moving.

03:47.333 --> 03:47.974
This is great.

03:47.994 --> 03:50.897
This is wonderful.

03:50.917 --> 03:52.019
This back up there.

03:52.039 --> 03:53.701
Okay.

03:53.721 --> 03:54.141
Let's make it.

03:54.543 --> 03:58.827
Yeah, that's the end of one section there.

03:58.847 --> 04:11.259
The main problem with printing anything off the web is the pages are never numbered, so you have to be careful about the end of eight months.

04:11.760 --> 04:13.481
But it wasn't just these two libraries.

04:13.501 --> 04:21.109
I mean, in Sarajevo, seven or eight of the branches of the public library were destroyed, targeted and destroyed.

04:21.129 --> 04:24.432
And most are the public library, the university library.

04:25.087 --> 04:34.737
the library of the Archbishop of Mostar, the archives of the State Commission on Conservation of Monuments, all of these, many small towns.

04:34.918 --> 04:42.766
The local archives were the first ones they went after when they blew up mosques or Catholic churches.

04:43.487 --> 04:48.192
They always blew up the community buildings or parish house that had the local records.

04:49.775 --> 04:56.043
I mean, the idea really is to remove not only the people, but any trace that they ever were there.

04:57.084 --> 05:06.296
If your ideology says that people can never live together, then the evidence that they've actually managed to do so successfully over centuries is something you cannot let stand.

05:06.577 --> 05:08.079
Now, you're from Hungary.

05:08.139 --> 05:09.420
How long have you been here?

05:10.201 --> 05:11.142
Since I was 13.

05:11.383 --> 05:12.284
A long time.

05:12.564 --> 05:13.926
Came here in 1961.

05:14.682 --> 05:18.606
I'm working at it here.

05:19.026 --> 05:27.294
I've got a lot to work with here, I think.

05:28.195 --> 05:30.798
When do you think is the best time to go over there?

05:32.359 --> 05:35.442
The winters are basically parallel our winters, right?

05:35.542 --> 05:41.168
Yeah, and I think you'd probably want to go sooner rather than later.

05:41.208 --> 05:42.529
I don't think

05:42.745 --> 05:46.090
Politically, anything is likely to go wrong there before the U.S.

05:46.130 --> 05:48.794
elections, because Clinton wouldn't let that happen.

05:48.814 --> 05:55.724
If Bosnia blows up in late October, it would be dreadful for the presidential elections.

05:57.066 --> 05:59.229
There are no guarantees for December.

06:00.671 --> 06:06.880
So if you really intend to go, I can put you in touch with somebody who's just been there.

06:07.045 --> 06:10.769
and who can give you a recommendation on places to stay and people to see.

06:11.130 --> 06:13.873
And also the best way to get there.

06:13.933 --> 06:20.201
I guess you said going through Amsterdam is probably the... Was it you that said or was it... No, I didn't say anything about Amsterdam.

06:20.261 --> 06:21.782
Marion said that, I think.

06:23.585 --> 06:27.689
Well, she was there just a few months ago.

06:27.730 --> 06:35.719
This is something... This is like one section of their heritage that was lost, just the...

06:35.969 --> 06:39.893
Islamic manuscripts, which means about 50,000 throughout the country.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.875
Did this print out all of it?

06:42.015 --> 06:45.820
No, it ran out of paper.

06:45.860 --> 06:56.591
Not so much for the list itself, which gets sort of numbing as you keep reading, but there's an end note that I think... These are the things I'd like to have, however.

06:56.611 --> 06:58.994
Yeah.

06:59.014 --> 07:05.841
There's an end note to that... No, I actually rather like having all of this.

07:07.087 --> 07:24.029
a rather dumb website by somebody who went to Sarajevo, took lots of snapshots of people and asked them to give representative quotes, most of which are not terribly interesting, but that's just the background he chose.

07:26.933 --> 07:32.520
But the reason I picked this is because one of the people he happens to interview is

07:34.357 --> 07:37.962
How in the world did he choose those monkeys at Scotland?

07:37.982 --> 07:38.583
Yeah, I don't know.

07:38.603 --> 07:57.968
Explain your own... I mean, obviously, you're from that region, certainly not from that country, but you're from your European... No, my own connection is... I mean, I never had a close personal connection to Bosnia as such.

07:59.618 --> 08:11.235
First of all, I think because I've traveled in that area, this is the last part, which you might want to look at.

08:11.295 --> 08:15.181
It's part of the experience.

08:15.782 --> 08:20.989
We had a volunteer who actually keyed in this list of libraries that were destroyed.

08:21.030 --> 08:22.051
Oh, right.

08:22.111 --> 08:24.054
Okay.

08:24.074 --> 08:25.957
Are you talking about your own interests?

08:27.319 --> 08:27.499
Yeah.

08:28.373 --> 08:33.041
What happened was... I'll read all of this when I get in.

08:33.061 --> 08:33.161
Yeah.

08:35.825 --> 08:43.237
First of all, as a librarian, I just found it outrageous that a major library of one and a half million books could burn down.

08:43.277 --> 08:51.310
And nobody even took cognizance of the fact, let alone raised a voice in protest or tried to help.

08:52.268 --> 08:54.772
I mean, I was just absolutely flabbergasted.

08:54.832 --> 09:02.184
The first thing I did when I learned about it is I started writing letters to all the professional organizations I was a member of.

09:03.466 --> 09:10.518
And nobody—the historians, the librarians, the archivists—nobody wanted to touch it with ten-foot poles.

09:10.538 --> 09:10.718
Why?

09:10.858 --> 09:12.801
Because of the politics?

09:12.902 --> 09:19.272
Yeah, the American Library Association said, well, we don't do politics, as if burning books is a political thing.

09:19.437 --> 09:30.672
You know, this really stupid American notion that every coin has two sides and every dispute can be safely split down the middle.

09:30.732 --> 09:43.469
And, you know, I'm sure these very same people that had been alive in 1942 would have said, well, now for our next panel discussion, we'll give five minutes to Herr Göring and five minutes to the Jewish gentleman.

09:43.529 --> 09:47.554
And I'm sure the truth is somewhere down the middle.

09:48.074 --> 09:49.195
You know, that sort of thing.

09:49.235 --> 09:51.338
So, gosh, we don't want to take sides.

09:51.358 --> 09:54.122
Did they answer your letters, or did they ignore them?

09:54.762 --> 10:00.229
I got back very cautiously worded responses, usually by telephone.

10:00.249 --> 10:01.751
They don't want to do anything in writing.

10:03.113 --> 10:07.699
And generally saying, no, we cannot introduce this on the agenda.

10:07.899 --> 10:12.765
If we did, we couldn't point fingers, name names.

10:13.100 --> 10:18.168
Tania Lorkovich, who was—I mean, I just quit the ALA over it.

10:18.608 --> 10:19.550
Really?

10:19.570 --> 10:26.600
Tania Lorkovich, who is a librarian at Yale, actually pushed for a resolution at ALA's 1993 mid-winter meeting.

10:27.141 --> 10:29.064
There was a huge ruckus about it.

10:30.486 --> 10:41.503
Various people who were annoyed at the ALA for various other past resolutions that they politically disagreed with, although they had no particular access to grind about Bosnia,

10:41.686 --> 10:45.671
were absolutely outraged that the ALA should be spending its time on such things.

10:46.652 --> 10:48.674
And so there was a huge floor fight.

10:48.974 --> 11:04.312
This was the mid-winter meeting in Denver, out of which eventually, after much acrimony, came the most namby-pamby resolution deploring the loss of access to information of the peoples of the former Yugoslavia.

11:06.534 --> 11:09.938
It's as if these libraries had all somehow destroyed themselves.

11:10.762 --> 11:14.687
There was no mention of the agency that destroyed them.

11:15.288 --> 11:17.551
There was also no action suggested.

11:18.112 --> 11:39.300
But what really blows my mind about it is that in order to placate the people who had objected to the resolution in the first place, the ALA decided, contrary to their practice in the past with resolutions, to send the text of the resolution to three or four designated agencies

11:39.736 --> 11:49.172
the White House, the International Federation of Library Association, UNESCO, but then not to publicize it, even in its own publications.

11:50.314 --> 12:01.293
So having taken this brave resolution, it was mentioned in passing in the overall report on the Denver meeting in about half a sentence, and that was it.

12:02.455 --> 12:05.220
If I wanted to talk to somebody at the ALA,

12:05.403 --> 12:18.844
You can talk to Tania Lorkovich, who was at the meeting, but I can probably dig up for you the person who eventually leaked the text of the resolution to me, somebody at the L.A.

12:18.864 --> 12:19.585
headquarters.

12:20.126 --> 12:29.520
And so I actually have it, otherwise I'd have no way of knowing what it was even that they voted on.

12:30.040 --> 12:35.385
IFLA, the International Federation of Library Association, met in Barcelona that summer.

12:36.125 --> 12:47.936
An almost identical text was passed, only after any mention of the word Bosnia was deleted from it at the insistence of the Russian delegations, which said they would walk out.

12:50.618 --> 12:58.545
And the ALA, with all of its political involvement domestically, and you know they are one of the more political organizations around,

12:58.981 --> 13:15.404
and with all of its resources, you know, huge membership, has yet to take any action to aid Bosnian libraries in terms of helping to train librarians or organizing assistance.

13:15.424 --> 13:26.339
I mean, that's what really bugs me, that it's left to people like me with no resources and full-time jobs and families to do this on the side.

13:26.519 --> 13:26.659
Mm-hmm.

13:27.550 --> 13:34.297
when you have what a Council of Europe report called a major cultural catastrophe.

13:34.317 --> 13:35.318
Who else works with you?

13:35.598 --> 13:37.240
I mean, who would you like to give credit to?

13:38.101 --> 13:40.003
Well, there are people like Tania.

13:40.303 --> 13:42.185
There's people like... How many spell her name?

13:42.406 --> 13:43.507
T-A-N-I-A.

13:44.668 --> 13:46.790
L-O-R-K-O-V-I-C.

13:46.970 --> 13:48.052
And she's in Yale?

13:48.072 --> 13:50.034
Yeah, she's the Slavic librarian at Yale.

13:50.554 --> 13:54.098
There's the Slavic... She's at the Stirling.

13:54.871 --> 14:03.147
Then there's Janet Crayne, C-R-A-Y-N-E, who is a Slavic specialist at the University of Michigan, who has worked very hard on this.

14:03.909 --> 14:08.678
There's my colleague, Jeff Spurr, who is a cataloger here at the Fine Arts Library.

14:09.097 --> 14:10.459
S-P-U-R-R.

14:10.719 --> 14:12.902
He'll be coming back from vacation on the 19th.

14:12.942 --> 14:18.150
You know a fellow out in Indiana by the name of Laszlo Kovacs?

14:18.170 --> 14:18.851
Have you ever heard of him?

14:19.131 --> 14:22.215
No, it sounds like a very common Hungarian name.

14:22.235 --> 14:23.437
He's quite a bibliographer.

14:23.457 --> 14:34.052
He contacted me after A Gentle Madness, and he's traveled extensively through European, not in conjunction with Sarajevo, but I thought you might know him.

14:34.573 --> 14:36.235
He's written a lot of articles.

14:36.434 --> 14:46.748
So anyway, then there's the nice systems people at Harvard who really sort of took the ball and ran with it and initiated that whole OCLC project.

14:47.649 --> 14:57.523
So there are people throughout the world who have been trying to move things, but again, they've been small private individuals, people struggling to set up little private foundations.

14:59.405 --> 15:04.332
There's the Sarajevo Fund in New York, which was largely from the proceeds of one book,

15:05.105 --> 15:07.608
Why Bosnia Writings on the Balkan War.

15:07.648 --> 15:08.809
Have you ever seen it?

15:08.929 --> 15:10.151
I've heard of the book, yeah.

15:10.171 --> 15:16.358
Yeah, anyway, part of the proceeds of the book went into the Sarajevo Fund, but that's raised less than $10,000 so far.

15:16.418 --> 15:19.782
So realistically, when do you think that you'll see something?

15:20.903 --> 15:22.765
Well, some things are happening.

15:22.885 --> 15:29.593
One thing is the first shipment of books from Sabre will be leaving for Bosnia next month.

15:30.434 --> 15:43.667
There is a gentleman called Merle Colglazier, M-E-R-L-E C-O-L-G-L-A-Z-I-E-R, who is a medical librarian somewhere in Virginia, I believe.

15:44.768 --> 15:53.576
And he worked out something called Journal Share, where he's just sending a whole container load of medical journals to the University of Sarajevo.

15:55.098 --> 15:58.281
In the case of Sabre, we've got a real ongoing program.

15:58.717 --> 16:02.341
We've gotten a number of publishers involved.

16:03.502 --> 16:06.746
So far, Harvard is involved in a big way.

16:06.946 --> 16:10.290
MIT and BC are involved with them.

16:10.851 --> 16:24.606
There is a wonderful gentleman in Montreal by the name of Andre McLaughlin, who, in spite of the McLaughlin, is actually French-Canadian, and who

16:25.210 --> 16:27.352
was much seized by this whole thing.

16:27.792 --> 16:31.176
He's a great friend of Bakarsic, by the way.

16:31.196 --> 16:31.977
I thought that was he.

16:32.357 --> 16:34.099
Yeah.

16:34.119 --> 16:41.045
And he was, during the war, was actually smuggling in printing paper through the U.N.

16:41.065 --> 16:41.446
lines.

16:42.747 --> 16:45.810
The UMPRAFOR, the U.N.

16:45.830 --> 16:53.277
Protection Force, during the middle of the siege, was operating Sarajevo Airport strictly for relief supplies.

16:53.965 --> 16:59.676
And they had a list of forbidden items given to them by the Serbs, amongst which were books and printing paper.

17:01.139 --> 17:10.677
And I know of at least one shipment of 5,000 medical books that was destroyed on the tarmac by UN troops because they had come in on a relief flight.

17:12.099 --> 17:13.001
So that was punishment?

17:13.482 --> 17:14.424
That was a no-no?

17:14.744 --> 17:15.045
Yes.

17:17.523 --> 17:20.446
Other things included personal letters.

17:20.927 --> 17:30.638
If you had more than five personal letters that you were carrying for people, the UN people would search your luggage and confiscate and destroy excess letters.

17:30.678 --> 17:33.862
Why don't they just let them go through?

17:33.922 --> 17:44.574
Because they said they weren't there to take sides, and if they didn't follow the directions of the Serbs, that would imperil the shipments of relief supplies.

17:45.155 --> 17:45.235
Wow.

17:45.805 --> 17:51.171
So they were acting essentially as the capos, the camp guards for the Serbs.

17:51.191 --> 18:04.104
Anyway, McLaughlin actually holds strings in Canada using local Canadian politics by persuading the Quebec provincial government to donate supplies of printing paper, of which Quebec has a superfluity.

18:05.666 --> 18:14.395
And then because Canada is the way it is, any Canadian undertaking, including humanitarian relief, has to have a French-Canadian component.

18:15.421 --> 18:17.283
You know, it's sort of like affirmative action.

18:18.264 --> 18:30.296
And so he somehow talked Care Canada into making space on its shipments of relief supplies for the printing paper donated by Quebec.

18:30.917 --> 18:35.301
And Care Canada, unlike Care U.S., has direct links with the Canadian government.

18:36.382 --> 18:45.411
Then once the paper got unloaded on the Adriatic coast, he got Care Canada to supply trucks

18:45.931 --> 18:59.085
which trucked the paper to the outer edge of Sarajevo Airport, where he waited for about two months until a ceasefire, which allowed him to drive the trucks across without anybody stopping him.

18:59.105 --> 19:03.329
And the paper was used to print children's books.

19:05.912 --> 19:09.696
So anyway, I'll also tell you how to get in touch with him.

19:09.756 --> 19:11.918
This is the quote from Bakasic, which is funny.

19:14.200 --> 19:14.841
To be...

19:15.192 --> 19:16.013
Why don't you read it?

19:16.033 --> 19:18.857
To be quite frank and sincere, this is how I feel today.

19:18.877 --> 19:21.641
I am a small church, not a great cathedral.

19:22.322 --> 19:37.923
This is reflecting on the frustration of having to gratefully receive several tons of useless and obsolete textbooks, a gift of some thoughtless but well-meaning individual who had not considered that the cost of transporting this paper to Sarajevo could have rebuilt a school.

19:38.383 --> 19:39.705
Just give me the money, please.

19:41.748 --> 19:43.410
I mean, this is the other tragedy.

19:43.593 --> 19:50.463
You tell people about this, their first reaction is, my God, we have all these books left over from our last duplicate sale.

19:50.483 --> 19:52.706
Sure, yeah, but you read his digest, condensed books.

19:53.067 --> 19:53.447
Exactly.

19:53.467 --> 19:54.228
Totally useless.

19:55.050 --> 19:57.253
That's why they're left over in being sent.

19:57.834 --> 19:58.414
Yes.

19:58.635 --> 20:03.922
You know, the 1967 membership list of the American Association of Electrical Engineers.

20:03.982 --> 20:05.004
Thanks a lot.

20:05.224 --> 20:06.025
Yeah.

20:06.767 --> 20:07.327
That's funny.

20:07.628 --> 20:12.655
So this is why I'm so glad that we got Sabre...

20:13.597 --> 20:39.385
involved because they will not ship any book over until they've had an okay from the other end. So they actually? The computer does help. Yeah. So they email or fax whole lists which they're then are checked off at the other end. I mean I expect to I don't know the context exactly where this fits into my book. Yeah. It will get in. Yeah. You know because I am certainly interested in the future.

20:39.652 --> 20:40.033
Yeah.

20:40.273 --> 20:42.636
And this is the future, too.

20:42.796 --> 20:45.740
I mean, the future is always this kind of stuff, isn't it?

20:45.760 --> 20:45.861
Yeah.

20:46.221 --> 20:49.626
But, you know, again, what he's looking for are books.

20:50.066 --> 20:55.654
Realistically, you're not going to have 800 village schools in Bosnia suddenly reading all their texts online.

20:55.895 --> 20:58.638
That's right.

20:59.259 --> 21:01.482
But this is a guy who knows about books.

21:01.502 --> 21:09.253
So he's giving up the ministry post and turning down a lucrative offer from World Bank to...

21:09.537 --> 21:14.443
direct the distribution of the books that Saber strips over.

21:14.483 --> 21:21.632
This is the same fellow that you're corresponding with, and this is the fellow who describes the burning.

21:21.733 --> 21:27.760
He also is the fellow that burned the books for heat, right?

21:28.161 --> 21:28.341
Right.

21:30.203 --> 21:31.525
So, pretty amazing stuff.

21:31.585 --> 21:34.549
Now, let me get you a couple of other things I promised you.

21:35.322 --> 21:36.344
I don't want to take up too much.

21:36.384 --> 21:38.307
I got a 2 o'clock appointment in Boston.

21:38.327 --> 21:42.553
Okay, well, that clock is about 10 minutes fast.

21:42.573 --> 21:43.615
It's bar time.

21:46.439 --> 21:47.321
What time did you call?

21:47.541 --> 21:48.723
Bar time, you know.

21:49.163 --> 21:50.145
That's right.

21:50.165 --> 21:50.806
Last call.

21:53.330 --> 21:58.338
No, I used to work as a bartender back in college.

21:58.458 --> 21:59.980
Where did you go to school?

22:00.581 --> 22:01.462
University of Chicago.

22:01.763 --> 22:01.903
Uh-huh.

22:02.390 --> 22:12.187
And so my last year I was old enough to do it, and they always used to set the clock fast so people who had one last drink would still make it out in time.

22:13.309 --> 22:16.114
When you moved to the United States, did you live in Chicago?

22:16.434 --> 22:18.157
Yeah, I lived in Chicago.

22:18.277 --> 22:20.601
I essentially went to high school and college in Chicago.

22:20.622 --> 22:23.807
I went to graduate school at Princeton in New Jersey.

22:24.952 --> 22:27.054
And your degrees are in...?

22:27.214 --> 22:32.639
My undergraduate degree is in history, and actually had something to do with Bosnia.

22:34.160 --> 22:39.725
My graduate degrees are in New Year's studies at Princeton, and I have a library degree from Simmons.

22:39.745 --> 22:41.827
Which is a great place in a library.

22:41.847 --> 22:43.788
Yeah, the virtual monopoly in New England.

22:43.808 --> 22:47.211
And your duties here at Harvard...?

22:47.231 --> 22:51.215
I'm a bibliographer for Islamic art and architecture.

22:51.875 --> 22:54.958
Harvard has a chair in Islamic art history.

22:55.310 --> 22:57.312
And this is part of the support structure.

22:58.033 --> 23:03.899
When they establish the chair, they set up a small endowment to run a department in the library.

23:05.300 --> 23:06.481
And how large is the library?

23:06.922 --> 23:15.010
Oh, well, the books and photos, et cetera, that we buy all get integrated into the Harvard libraries, which is huge.

23:15.731 --> 23:17.592
But I mean, I thought you meant to collect them.

23:17.612 --> 23:18.073
No, no.

23:18.453 --> 23:21.196
So it's all integrated in the larger Harvard libraries.

23:22.217 --> 23:22.337
Right.

23:22.357 --> 23:25.080
So we buy books.

23:25.634 --> 23:27.296
by photographs and slides.

23:27.477 --> 23:28.598
We catalog them.

23:28.738 --> 23:31.482
We provide reference services.

23:33.385 --> 23:34.827
We're at Widener?

23:34.847 --> 23:35.508
Mostly here.

23:35.548 --> 23:38.252
Some at Widener, a few at the architecture library.

23:39.233 --> 23:46.784
And we do this kind of thing, which is essentially bibliographic outreach.

23:47.304 --> 23:54.274
What we do is indexes that are published all over the world.

23:54.558 --> 24:01.267
On specific subjects, we do the subject cataloging for, subject indexing for Islamic art and architecture.

24:03.470 --> 24:04.091
This one.

24:07.816 --> 24:10.721
Basically, we see to it that people know about books.

24:11.141 --> 24:22.557
And again, in the modern electronic world, what this results in is people who live in places that don't have these journals write to us with requests for Xeroxes of articles.

24:23.228 --> 24:28.197
But if the indexes didn't have the citations, they wouldn't know these things existed.

24:29.800 --> 24:32.224
Let me get you two things.

24:32.966 --> 24:34.649
Oh, yeah, this is what I just got today.

24:34.669 --> 24:40.379
It says, hi, Andras, in case you haven't seen this email message, I'm forwarding you a copy.

24:40.419 --> 24:47.312
JournalShare will be sending a 20-foot container of medical journals to the University of Sarajevo in early September.

24:47.765 --> 24:51.451
This will be our first shipment, and hopefully there will be many future shipments.

24:51.631 --> 24:53.835
I'll keep you informed.

24:53.895 --> 24:55.477
I'll print this out for you.

24:55.497 --> 24:57.260
That's today?

24:57.821 --> 24:59.083
Yeah, they just came in today.

25:00.726 --> 25:03.530
And let's see.

25:03.550 --> 25:04.812
And this was just yesterday.

25:04.853 --> 25:10.121
This is the press release on... Oh, the Harvard thing, yeah.

25:10.141 --> 25:11.083
I'd love to see that.

25:11.523 --> 25:12.625
Get a copy of that.

25:12.841 --> 25:14.824
Anyway, this, again, is hot off the press.

25:14.864 --> 25:18.089
We just got the okay yesterday from the Harvard president's office.

25:20.973 --> 25:24.599
Got a call to run everything by them before you send it out.

25:24.619 --> 25:35.936
I'm an old public affairs officer in the Navy, and I... Protocol is... Anyway, if you want to reach Cole Glaser, he's got an email.

25:36.036 --> 25:40.823
I'll also get you Lorcovich's email.

25:41.427 --> 25:45.993
Oh, if she's not very good at answering here, you may have to call her up.

25:46.013 --> 25:46.494
I'll call her.

25:47.835 --> 25:52.121
And perhaps, and then I guess if I could get that New York Times article from yesterday.

25:52.141 --> 25:53.102
That's upstairs, yeah.

25:53.122 --> 25:55.085
But one day I couldn't get a Times yesterday.

25:55.145 --> 25:58.089
You know, they won't deliver my address in Grafton.

25:58.109 --> 25:58.830
What's wrong with it?

25:59.831 --> 26:01.373
Well, I have to go buy it.

26:01.573 --> 26:08.022
I mean, the stores get two copies, three copies, and all of my outlets were out yesterday.

26:08.843 --> 26:08.903
Oh.

26:10.874 --> 26:11.555
Well, that happens.

26:11.615 --> 26:13.777
I read the New York Times on the computer.

26:13.977 --> 26:18.202
I just go... Okay, and we can Xerox a couple of those other things for you.

26:18.722 --> 26:23.147
Now, let's see if I have Tania's thing here.

26:23.167 --> 26:24.128
I'm going to shut off it.

26:24.308 --> 26:25.370
Tania Lorko

26:25.530 --> 26:27.131
L-O-R-K-O-V-I-C.

26:27.211 --> 26:27.852
I saw it, yeah.

26:27.872 --> 26:29.594
Yeah.

26:32.377 --> 26:33.298
Yeah, that's Connecticut.

26:33.318 --> 26:33.738
I'm sorry.

26:33.758 --> 26:37.002
Yeah.

26:37.022 --> 26:38.343
V-T-J-A-N.

26:38.383 --> 26:39.885
The J's and...

26:40.355 --> 27:07.813
that part of europe are always pronounced as y's. So who would have thought of her as we get to this point in the at the end of the century that you'd be talking about rebuilding a recently destroyed library? All righty I think this is good for a good. We're looking at uh to say it once more. It's a uh Sarajevo Urbicide meaning city and killing of cities and it was an exhibition

27:08.333 --> 27:17.068
published by the Association of Architects of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and then it was reprinted for showing at the Centre of Pompidou in Paris.

27:19.792 --> 27:28.928
And you're showing me a photograph of the burnt books of the Oriental Institute in Sarajevo.

27:29.629 --> 27:33.115
Copies of these photographs should be available to me, you'd think, huh?

27:33.135 --> 27:33.936
I can provide them.

27:34.068 --> 27:36.290
We don't need them right now, by the way.

27:36.451 --> 27:40.535
This is like the Museum of the City of Sarajevo with direct shell impacts.

27:42.377 --> 27:45.401
So it's really pretty ghastly.

27:46.242 --> 27:46.622
Mosque.

27:47.823 --> 27:50.446
Now, here you can see how the targeting analysis works.

27:50.967 --> 27:54.130
This is the 16th-century mosque of Ghazi Husrev Beg.

27:54.611 --> 28:01.299
You can see that is not a random pattern of shelling.

28:01.319 --> 28:01.459
No, no.

28:01.479 --> 28:02.520
Can I get a xerox of that, please?

28:02.540 --> 28:02.640
Sure.

28:03.363 --> 28:05.138
That would be really great.
