The Hemingway stuff is rather extraordinary.

00:28.873 --> 00:29.093
The prices.

00:29.073 --> 00:31.857
How do they get to these prices anyway, these estimates?

00:31.877 --> 00:33.279
These estimates aren't even close.

00:33.559 --> 00:35.161
No.

That's twenty-six thousand dollars up front.

03:01.417 --> 03:03.880

37:59.506 --> 38:00.267
$13,000.

38:00.408 --> 38:01.930
$15,000.

38:01.990 --> 38:03.192
$15,000.

38:03.232 --> 38:16.232
$15,000 now.

38:16.212 --> 38:22.298
I have $15,000, $16,000, $17,000, $18,000, $19,000.

38:22.899 --> 38:29.946
I have $19,000 now for my life, $19,000, $20,000, $21,000.

38:30.107 --> 38:34.371
I have $21,000 now for my life.

38:34.391 --> 38:36.633
I have $21,000 now for my life.

38:36.653 --> 38:44.802
I have $21,000 now for my life.

38:51.717 --> 39:19.446
There was not a contemporary

39:19.544 --> 39:21.067
in the 50s, 60s, and 70s.

39:21.087 --> 39:23.811
How do you explain those extraordinary prices, then?

39:23.831 --> 39:24.773
It's great.

39:24.793 --> 39:27.978
It's the same way the extraordinary prices and impression as they are.

39:27.998 --> 39:29.741
The simple supply and demand is economic.

39:29.762 --> 39:30.843
Although the letters went low.

39:30.863 --> 39:31.685
They went low.

39:31.765 --> 39:32.626
Below estimates.

39:32.727 --> 39:34.029
Some of the letters did.

39:34.049 --> 39:36.533
I think they all did, except for the last one you just got.

39:36.593 --> 39:36.753
Right.

39:36.834 --> 39:37.835
I bought the hard one.

39:37.855 --> 39:37.976
Right.

39:38.016 --> 39:39.338
No, there's a good point.

39:39.358 --> 39:40.300
I think it went under.

39:40.420 --> 39:41.722
I think it went under.

39:42.163 --> 39:45.248
You know, there aren't 11, 12,

39:45.498 --> 39:58.127
Would you tell me your name once again?

39:58.688 --> 39:59.450
Joe Maddalena.

39:59.470 --> 40:00.452
Joe Maddalena.

40:01.242 --> 40:14.079
I think the lack of collection, you know, at that level, in the market, everybody clicks margin through, because you can still buy margin.

40:14.259 --> 40:18.404
There's a million guys at Hemingway, there's a million guys at Jack London.

40:18.525 --> 40:22.710
But the problem with Paul and Melville is the material is so rare.

40:23.028 --> 40:32.295
Did you buy it for stock or for a client?

40:32.897 --> 40:33.679
Have you sold it yet?

40:33.699 --> 40:34.000
No.

40:34.418 --> 40:48.741
I'm surprised it's heroin rolling up for a buck and a half.

40:48.801 --> 40:53.108
It would have went last year.

40:53.149 --> 40:57.135
We bought a post-tail and a half.

40:57.571 --> 41:19.275
He might like to read my book.

41:19.508 --> 41:23.296
It's a pretty famous book.

41:24.278 --> 41:37.264
A while ago, in the morning.

41:39.623 --> 41:56.350
... ... ... ...

41:56.330 --> 42:04.738
I don't really think there is a dedication copy of Moby Dick.

42:04.798 --> 42:06.279
He dedicated the book to him.

42:06.299 --> 42:08.121
He dedicated the book to him.

42:08.401 --> 42:11.984
I think the one that Rosenbach has, it's just signed by Hawthorne.

42:12.004 --> 42:12.345
Right.

42:12.525 --> 42:14.066
Maybe someday there was one.

42:14.126 --> 42:15.307
You never know.

42:15.487 --> 42:18.130
It's not even a first print, either.

42:18.210 --> 42:24.936
We bought this book.

42:24.916 --> 42:49.894
and so in 1933 50 000 which which now we're talking about two one okay one of those things this is not a second edition they're wrong they don't know what you're talking about how long have you been in books

42:50.060 --> 43:12.000
Do you ever sell this to people in LA?

43:11.980 --> 43:13.862
We bought this.

43:13.902 --> 43:16.184
Tell me what it is.

43:16.604 --> 43:20.388
This is rarer than Tamerlane.

43:20.968 --> 43:27.194
There are only five copies.

43:28.575 --> 43:33.480
One in five is and we have it.

43:33.540 --> 43:41.667
This is five times as rare as Tamerlane.

43:41.950 --> 43:42.832
This is the rarest.

43:42.892 --> 43:43.493
$800.

43:43.513 --> 43:44.074
$800.

43:44.354 --> 43:44.615
$800.

43:44.635 --> 43:44.935
$800.

43:44.955 --> 43:45.156
$800.

43:45.176 --> 43:46.097
$700.

43:46.258 --> 43:46.819
$700.

43:46.839 --> 43:47.039
$700.

43:47.199 --> 43:47.600
$700.

43:47.620 --> 43:47.921
$700.

43:47.941 --> 43:48.321
$700.

43:48.341 --> 43:48.462
$700.

43:48.482 --> 43:48.702
$700.

43:48.722 --> 43:49.083
$700.

43:49.103 --> 43:49.423
$700.

43:49.584 --> 43:50.004
$700.

43:50.024 --> 43:50.405
$700.

43:50.425 --> 43:50.926
$700.

43:50.946 --> 43:51.367
$700.

43:51.387 --> 43:51.667
$700.

43:51.687 --> 43:51.888
$700.

43:51.908 --> 43:52.449
$700.

43:52.469 --> 43:52.669
$700.

43:52.689 --> 43:52.949
$700.

43:52.970 --> 43:53.170
$700.

43:53.190 --> 43:53.490
$700.

43:53.611 --> 43:53.931
$700.

43:53.991 --> 43:54.292
$700.

43:54.332 --> 43:54.612
$700.

43:54.632 --> 43:55.093
$700.

43:55.113 --> 43:55.213
$700.

43:55.234 --> 43:55.334
$700.

43:55.354 --> 43:55.514
$700.

43:55.534 --> 43:57.157
$700.

43:57.177 --> 43:57.437
$700.

43:57.598 --> 43:57.778
$700.

43:57.798 --> 43:57.898
$700.

43:57.918 --> 43:58.079
$700.

43:58.099 --> 43:58.279
$700.

43:58.299 --> 43:58.599
$700.

43:58.660 --> 43:58.760
$700.

43:58.780 --> 43:59.000
$700.

43:59.100 --> 43:59.341
$700.

43:59.822 --> 44:00.082
$700.

44:00.102 --> 44:00.483
$700.

44:00.503 --> 44:00.683
$700.

44:00.703 --> 44:00.884
$700.

44:00.904 --> 44:01.264
$700.

44:01.284 --> 44:01.725
$700.

44:01.745 --> 44:01.905
$700.

44:01.925 --> 44:02.246
$700.

44:02.266 --> 44:02.366

$700.

44:02.927 --> 44:03.148
$700.

44:03.168 --> 44:03.268

44:03.288 --> 44:03.448

44:03.468 --> 44:03.668
$700.

44:03.688 --> 44:03.809
$700.

44:03.829 --> 44:03.969
$700.

44:03.989 --> 44:04.129
$700.

44:04.149 --> 44:04.249
$700.

44:04.270 --> 44:04.450
$700.

44:04.470 --> 44:04.650
$700.

44:04.670 --> 44:04.770
$700.

44:04.790 --> 44:05.432
$700.

44:05.452 --> 44:05.632
$700.

44:05.672 --> 44:05.772
$700.

44:05.792 --> 44:05.892

44:06.073 --> 44:06.253
$700

44:06.554 --> 44:08.497
At 3250 on the Isle.

44:08.517 --> 44:14.645
At 3250, 3500, 3750, 4000, 4250, 4500, 4750.

44:14.765 --> 44:16.167
At 4750, Federal Isle.

44:16.688 --> 44:21.514
At 4750 now, Federal Isle at 4750, fair warning.

44:22.756 --> 44:23.297
107.

44:23.317 --> 44:23.978
4750.

44:24.058 --> 44:24.619
107.

44:28.364 --> 44:33.591
The last 2257.

44:36.187 --> 44:57.368
And I have $1,000,000, $1,000,000, $1,000,000, $1,000,000, $1,000,000, $1,000,000, $1,000,000, $1,000,000, $1,000,000, $1,000,000, $1,000,000, $1,000,000, $1,000,000, $1,000,000, $1,000,000, $1,000,000, $1,000,000, $1,000,000, $1,000,000, $1,000,000, $1,000,000, $1,000,000, $1,000,000, $1,000,000, $1,000,000, $1,000,000, $1,000,000, $1,000,000, $1,000,000, $1,000,000, $1,000,000, $1,000

44:57.348 --> 45:02.090
At $32.50, at $3,500.

45:02.110 --> 45:04.421
$4,000.

45:04.441 --> 45:06.531
I've got to start talking.

45:07.034 --> 45:19.633
Okay, kitty corner is a woman in a black sweater with a red hat.

45:19.733 --> 45:28.587
That's his wife.

45:29.697 --> 45:30.058
.

45:30.078 --> 45:30.238
.

45:30.358 --> 45:57.055
.

45:57.355 --> 46:04.523
I'll tell you this, here's the best collection.

46:04.543 --> 46:14.013
I mean, nobody has a book collection with them.

46:14.113 --> 46:16.515
It's why the hands get everything.

46:16.595 --> 46:17.436
Everything.

46:17.556 --> 46:26.586
And I have $200 for this, $200, $70 to $5,300 to $5,500 to $5,500 to $5,500 to $5,700 to $5,800 to $5,900 to $50,000 to $61.

46:28.608 --> 46:37.778
He's been collecting since the 40s.

46:38.299 --> 46:39.480
He says he's got everything.

46:39.960 --> 46:41.762
It's on the West Coast.

46:42.303 --> 46:44.005
I'm going to write the man.

46:45.947 --> 46:47.869
I'm going to get something going.

46:47.889 --> 46:48.129
$600.

46:48.149 --> 46:48.250
$600.

46:48.710 --> 46:49.171
$600.

46:49.191 --> 46:49.451
$700.

46:51.153 --> 46:55.037
$750.

46:56.873 --> 47:01.559
$7.50 on the telephone and then it's $7.50.

47:01.699 --> 47:06.926
Okay, $7.50.

47:06.946 --> 47:07.948
Law, $2,000, $7.52.

47:07.968 --> 47:16.879
And $200 will lose, a $200 company is $200, a $200 company is $200.

47:16.899 --> 47:19.983
$250 on the right now, $250.

47:20.003 --> 47:22.366
$250 at the cost of $250.

47:22.386 --> 47:25.851
$250 comes, $300, $250.

47:28.042 --> 47:32.348
$350 on my right side is $350.

47:32.368 --> 47:33.289
One, two, one.

47:35.472 --> 47:38.856
Now, somebody on the right side.

47:39.237 --> 47:40.538
Now, $2,353.

47:40.558 --> 47:45.144
And $50 with a list of $50 now, winning at $50.

47:45.184 --> 47:49.990
$75 now, winning at $75, $100.

47:50.010 --> 47:52.594
$100 in your notes and $100, $135.

47:52.774 --> 47:53.615
And $155, $135.

47:54.016 --> 47:55.838
On my left, there's one.

47:57.083 --> 48:06.486
135, 149, lot number 2654, and whatever goes on this, whatever goes on...

48:06.972 --> 48:11.119
This one has two chairs, two chunks out of it.

48:11.480 --> 48:12.582
This is grubby.

48:12.762 --> 48:16.488
This has, you know, actual enough part of that page.

48:16.589 --> 48:18.792
So it's six and one half dozen.

48:18.812 --> 48:23.520
They're both in all the Chamberlain's in front of the commission.

48:23.581 --> 48:26.666
They're really rare books.

48:26.726 --> 48:27.968
Have you handled any?

48:27.948 --> 48:48.522
oh yeah we were going to get probably

48:48.822 --> 49:12.130
you know

49:12.295 --> 49:15.359
I don't have any cards.

49:15.439 --> 49:20.185
I'm going to write you and send you some copies.

49:20.305 --> 49:22.027
I'll explain in the letter.

49:22.168 --> 49:26.373
I've got a hardcover deal with Random House.

49:26.473 --> 49:27.795
I've got a wonderful title.

49:27.815 --> 49:28.235
$3,000.

49:30.578 --> 49:31.680
Who ruined that?

49:32.221 --> 49:33.162
$3,000.

49:33.422 --> 49:36.666
I'd like to just be a book collector.

49:36.766 --> 49:39.270
Because we have a contemporary collector.

49:39.290 --> 49:41.172
There's about a dozen years of sight contemporary collectors.

49:42.367 --> 49:42.647
$1,500.

49:42.667 --> 49:48.894
$1,500.

49:48.974 --> 49:49.355
$1,500.

49:49.375 --> 49:49.915
$1,750.

49:49.956 --> 49:50.616
$1,750.

49:50.636 --> 49:51.397
$1,750.

49:51.417 --> 49:52.839
$1,750.

49:52.859 --> 49:53.279
$1,750.

49:53.299 --> 49:53.880
$1,750.

49:53.900 --> 49:54.581
$1,750.

49:54.601 --> 49:55.562
$1,750.

49:55.642 --> 49:56.403
$1,750.

49:56.423 --> 49:57.284
$1,750.

49:57.304 --> 49:58.085
$1,750.

49:58.105 --> 49:58.705
$1,750.

49:58.725 --> 49:59.606
$1,750.

49:59.646 --> 50:00.287
$1,750.

50:00.327 --> 50:00.888
$1,750.

50:00.928 --> 50:01.769
$1,750.

50:01.949 --> 50:02.490
$1,750.

50:03.030 --> 50:03.651
$1,750.

50:03.671 --> 50:04.652
$1,750.

50:04.672 --> 50:05.193
$1,750.

50:05.213 --> 50:05.593
$1,750.

50:05.653 --> 50:06.074
$1,750.

50:06.094 --> 50:07.195
$1,750.

50:07.235 --> 50:07.976
$1,750.

50:07.996 --> 50:08.616
$1,750.

50:08.636 --> 50:09.117
$1,750.

50:09.518 --> 50:09.938
$4,250.

50:09.978 --> 50:10.779
$4,500.

50:10.799 --> 50:12.441
$4,750.

50:12.461 --> 50:15.063
At $4,750 in the center of the room now.

50:15.484 --> 50:19.988
At $4,750 in advance, there's a $4,750 there running.

50:20.008 --> 50:21.509
$5,000.

50:21.529 --> 50:24.012
$5,500.

50:24.032 --> 50:24.292
$5,500.

50:24.312 --> 50:24.713
$5,500.

50:24.733 --> 50:26.995
$5,500.

50:27.035 --> 50:36.724
The last number is $2,269.

50:37.396 --> 50:44.286
And $600, $600, $700, $700, $700, and $800, standing at $800.

50:44.386 --> 50:45.688
I'm not saying that now.

50:45.708 --> 50:53.279
I'm waiting for Bill himself, who's having a pressure taken.

50:53.299 --> 50:54.801
For the Baltimore Sun.

50:54.821 --> 51:06.778
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 2000, 2250, 2500, 2750.

51:07.349 --> 51:12.495
This is the leaves of grass coming up next.

51:12.715 --> 51:17.841
I'm going to wait for this one, then I'm going to go grab him.

51:17.881 --> 51:20.705
This is the leaves of grass coming up next.

51:20.725 --> 51:22.166
This one right here.

51:22.207 --> 51:24.249
227 hours.

51:26.632 --> 51:35.382
I think it's the leaves of grass.

51:35.800 --> 51:55.530
That's a thousand.

51:55.730 --> 51:56.531
$15,000.

51:56.791 --> 51:57.052
Sure.

51:57.272 --> 52:01.057
At $15,000 now, being in the back, it's $15,000 now.

52:01.478 --> 52:05.784
At $16,000, $17,000, $18,000 standing.

52:05.964 --> 52:09.048
At $18,000, it's standing at $18,000.

52:09.068 --> 52:12.493
At $18,000 now, being at $18,000.

52:12.513 --> 52:14.536
At $18,000, standing in the back.

52:14.956 --> 52:18.922
At $18,000, we will prove now $18,000.

52:18.942 --> 52:21.906
$18,000.

52:22.392 --> 52:23.158
204.

52:23.380 --> 52:27.593
204.

52:28.687 --> 52:35.416
Quite briefly what I'm doing on my book.

52:35.436 --> 52:39.241
So when I write you, I'm learning what I call a selected history of book collection.

52:39.261 --> 52:48.473
I'm looking at the collection of reselectors, starting at the dissolution of the monastery, half of the book went, and then the breakup of the last five years.

52:48.493 --> 52:52.318
And then came in and saved by Robert Patton and Erloposki.

52:52.338 --> 52:55.622
And half of the book went on about a dozen really exciting contemporary collectors.

52:55.906 --> 53:06.938
I'm doing Charlotte of Boston, Leonard D. Sebastian in New York.

53:06.958 --> 53:10.388
So I'm doing some very, very interesting people.

53:10.823 --> 53:12.565
and I would like to include you in my study.

53:12.826 --> 53:13.567
It was a thesis.

53:13.647 --> 53:17.792
I mean, the collector has the preserver, not just an accumulator.

53:17.892 --> 53:21.157
The collector is responsible for the preservation of human achievement.

53:21.537 --> 53:22.739
That's my quick pitch.

53:22.759 --> 53:24.060
So I'll write you.

53:24.201 --> 53:27.044
And I'd like to come out to LA probably in May or so.

53:27.305 --> 53:32.612
I'm going to England in April to do some research in April.

53:33.433 --> 53:37.718
Thank you so much.

53:37.758 --> 53:38.940
Thank you so much.

53:39.207 --> 54:01.435
Yeah.

54:01.921 --> 54:08.128
How long have you been preparing for this book?

54:08.849 --> 54:15.817
I've read a book review and I have a newspaper teller for 12 years.

54:15.837 --> 54:18.620
So that's my day job, so to speak.

54:18.640 --> 54:21.904
And my passion is collect books.

54:21.924 --> 54:25.028
So what do you think of that material?

54:25.268 --> 54:28.312
Oh, it's such a great idea.

54:28.592 --> 54:31.135
It wasn't just one great item.

54:31.655 --> 54:38.644
through letters.

54:38.928 --> 54:42.774
The Americano was known as a highspot.

54:42.874 --> 54:44.777
You heard of that phrase?

54:44.957 --> 54:45.377
Highspots.

54:45.397 --> 54:46.840
H-I-G-H-S-P-O-T.

54:46.920 --> 54:49.884
He only had one Faulkner, right?

54:49.904 --> 54:52.207
Which was his first book signed from Marble Point.

54:52.228 --> 54:53.229
That's a highspot.

54:53.249 --> 54:54.911
That's the first Faulkner to get.

54:55.392 --> 54:56.634
Was that good or bad?

54:57.175 --> 54:59.819
It doesn't have a reflect effect.

55:00.319 --> 55:02.262
He did some very nice Henry Miriams.

55:02.282 --> 55:03.484
He must have known him.

55:03.464 --> 55:17.878
But he had two, if you look at your candle, I guess he, with the exception of a few others, you know, he had two, three, four, five, or six, but his pro-comotion was extraordinary.

55:17.998 --> 55:18.618
Well, why?

55:18.678 --> 55:20.220
Just because of it?

55:20.280 --> 55:23.223
I suppose he loved it, you know.

55:23.283 --> 55:24.904
Well, why was it extraordinary?

55:24.944 --> 55:27.907
Well, first of all, there was only one of two tenaways in private events.

55:27.927 --> 55:30.990
The other book that Joe showed you was even more serious than a tenaway.

55:30.970 --> 55:38.112
I mean, he has absolutely the most American editorial to say, which is a whistleblower.

55:38.395 --> 55:41.738
The National for the Finest, they don't know the Tamarine.

55:41.758 --> 55:44.882
There isn't a Tamarine at Harvard University.

55:45.142 --> 55:46.764
They don't know the Tamarine.

55:47.264 --> 55:48.926
But also the depth.

55:49.326 --> 55:52.950
That front of letters there was just extraordinary.

55:53.050 --> 56:00.798
A letter to chickens, a letter to hot, I mean, you know, they're not just letters.

56:00.838 --> 56:03.681
They are substantive letters.

56:04.021 --> 56:05.803
That makes them much more

56:05.868 --> 56:34.221
Two thousand two hundred and eighty-one let's catch the wind And $200 bill this is $200 happening at $200 250

56:34.522 --> 56:36.385
I'd like to say copy.

56:36.565 --> 56:37.627
I'd love to say copy.

56:38.248 --> 56:43.797
And I'll say this is stuff that I've got to give you an idea about it.

56:43.917 --> 56:46.261
Thank you all very much.

56:46.281 --> 56:53.733
I will call it the end of the actual level.

56:53.813 --> 56:57.559
So this will begin at N15 tomorrow morning.
