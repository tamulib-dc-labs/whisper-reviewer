WEBVTT

00:02.967 --> 00:04.489
It's irrelevant.

00:04.570 --> 00:07.695
It really is irrelevant to it.

00:07.715 --> 00:09.037
I love your snow button.

00:09.057 --> 00:09.678
It's half the fun.

00:09.698 --> 00:10.980
Listen to your stories.

00:11.000 --> 00:11.841
I got a lot.

00:11.861 --> 00:14.786
I mean, you know, because you get around, you know, and everything.

00:15.327 --> 00:18.973
That's going to be a terrific story.

00:20.696 --> 00:27.387
Texas decided, and they did it within 15 years, that we're going to be major.

00:28.108 --> 00:28.789
We're going to be big.

00:29.309 --> 00:35.162
And if you have to break a few weights to make an armlet, you know, well, they did buy everything in sight.

00:35.482 --> 00:37.226
They got 41 copies of Ulysses.

00:37.246 --> 00:38.669
I mean, did they need 41 copies?

00:38.689 --> 00:40.773
They didn't even know they had 41, but they were fine.

00:41.675 --> 00:47.588
You did mention, I had nothing, this is from, it's so funny, it's cute, you know.

00:47.922 --> 01:14.723
uh henry huntington by the way started late in life yes much later in life than you did by the way he may have even been 60 or so which is why he was so obsessed with getting it all together he did that huntington library for seven years nobody even blows my mind nobody even heard of him until he came to new york in 1912 and only then when he when he bought

01:15.091 --> 01:17.294
Everything he wanted.

01:17.314 --> 01:22.783
Basically, what our attitude is, whatever it is, don't worry about it.

01:22.803 --> 01:24.185
It's not too much.

01:24.205 --> 01:28.873
He paid $50,000 for the Gutenberg Bible, and I took about the most money ever spent.

01:28.953 --> 01:34.682
It's lasted for years and years and years, and if he had to pay more, he would have had to pay more.

01:34.702 --> 01:36.945
That's right, he would have done it.

01:36.965 --> 01:40.090
And that was on vellum, by the way.

01:40.130 --> 01:40.831
What's that worth?

01:40.851 --> 01:41.993
$15, $20 million?

01:42.462 --> 01:44.124
I don't even know if you can put a price on it.

01:44.144 --> 01:45.005
It's like with Vermeer.

01:45.225 --> 01:46.267
I mean, it's almost so great.

01:46.307 --> 01:46.387
Yes.

01:46.407 --> 01:48.489
With Vermeer, you can't put a price on it.

01:48.509 --> 01:48.729
No.

01:49.791 --> 01:55.498
That painting, that painting is probably, should be the most expensive painting in the world.

01:56.158 --> 02:05.329
Because he only did, not only did he only do 36 pictures, whatever it was, he is also recognized as the greatest painter of that genre.

02:06.731 --> 02:07.592
That's right.

02:08.821 --> 02:37.478
you have a film noir collection yes now what is that these are these are these are these are the great uh these no these are the actual man these are the actual um scripts uh can you name yourself sure sure casablanca i have the original uh i have the director's script uh with all the changes all the changes uh they were writing that movie as they were going along i don't know if you're aware of that uh and uh the entire ending

02:37.795 --> 02:39.417
It was just a classic ending.

02:40.799 --> 02:48.871
He and Claude, when Bogart and Claude Rains go off into the sunset, so to speak, at the airport, all that dialogue was changed.

02:49.972 --> 03:03.011
And I have most of the 1940s and 50s couloir scripts like that.

03:03.051 --> 03:03.932
Mine sometimes goes blank.

03:03.992 --> 03:06.756
I've got to think of titles.

03:07.360 --> 03:30.448
my god that's all right because we can get some of this later all right can we because we're going to talk i'll give you we'll talk home show because there's a lot we're just we're just really getting to know each other okay this is dancing i'm amazed that you ask all these questions i have a script before you which is wonderful i'm on track by the way i know i'm going

03:31.424 --> 03:33.706
By the way, tell me when you have to wrap up.

03:33.726 --> 03:34.187
I'm okay.

03:34.447 --> 03:35.308
Not a problem.

03:35.388 --> 03:36.849
I'm good for 2.15.

03:36.889 --> 03:39.972
What's gotten away that you really wanted?

03:40.012 --> 03:42.154
What continues to rank on you?

03:42.294 --> 03:44.576
Yeah, it's a couple of things.

03:44.796 --> 03:54.606
I'm just going to think about where you want to hold the tape for a second.

03:54.626 --> 04:00.351
Believe it or not, that last Gutenberg, I was... Unfortunately, I was out of the country at the time.

04:00.567 --> 04:03.211
Oh, you mean the one that went to the Japanese?

04:03.231 --> 04:04.552
The one that went to the Japanese.

04:04.672 --> 04:07.216
And I don't know when the next one's going to come up.

04:07.236 --> 04:08.317
That wasn't a complete one.

04:08.337 --> 04:09.038
No, it wasn't.

04:09.239 --> 04:17.930
And that's one of the reasons why I danced around, going out of town, out of the country, and the heck with it.

04:17.950 --> 04:21.495
When I came back, I fell back.

04:22.235 --> 04:24.958
But what are you perceiving?

04:26.681 --> 04:31.507
Again, this quote that you've given stuff to Delaware that has made the collection.

04:32.528 --> 04:34.230
And you mentioned that you've got a couple of rooms.

04:34.250 --> 04:35.412
The gallery of Chicago.

04:35.432 --> 04:38.055
This must be a source of really great satisfaction.

04:38.075 --> 04:38.576
Oh, absolutely.

04:38.596 --> 04:41.379
Not only have you collected, but you've kind of made a gift.

04:41.399 --> 04:41.700
Yes.

04:42.020 --> 04:44.704
How about the books?

04:44.784 --> 04:46.786
What's the future of it?

04:47.047 --> 04:49.710
I'm sort of wrestling with that.

04:50.382 --> 05:18.803
i believe that uh books should be circulated because i'm always very happy that i've had the opportunity to collect some very wonderful books because they weren't given to an institution see i think i think books are much rarer and much less available some of the great books are much less available than than paintings or furniture because you can always get you can't get one painting by a particular one you get another one

05:19.492 --> 05:25.920
If you can't get one example of a piece of furniture, you get another one.

05:25.940 --> 05:30.807
In certain categories, it's much tougher to get great examples of particular books.

05:33.050 --> 05:33.490
That's interesting.

05:33.510 --> 05:38.377
And because of that, I believe that books should keep recirculating wherever possible.

05:38.397 --> 05:40.039
The reason is interesting.

05:40.159 --> 05:48.790
A book is not something that is on display like a painting or an art object or a decorative art object or whatever.

05:49.529 --> 06:03.671
A book is usually, you know, these kinds of books that we're talking about are in reference libraries, private libraries, university libraries, and only through very special permission can one get in to see them.

06:03.691 --> 06:14.827
When one gets in to see them, they're really going to see, most times, they're going to see the book for its content, not because it's the first edition.

06:14.847 --> 06:17.832
They're not looking at the book, except for the few

06:18.368 --> 06:44.460
interested parties and i really mean few and especially manuscript and especially manuscript material which is unique yes exactly they're looking at it for the content therefore it's never on display for public use and since it isn't it might as well be in circulation in private and private libraries as well as public libraries as long as

06:44.761 --> 06:55.195
There are reproductions or other printings or reproductions of the manuscripts so that scholars can have access to the actual written material.

06:55.996 --> 06:58.720
Otherwise, the actual books should be enjoyed.

06:59.121 --> 07:04.288
They are not enjoyed by anybody in these institutions.

07:04.308 --> 07:05.009
That's a fact.

07:05.029 --> 07:07.392
The only one that enjoys them is the librarian.

07:07.412 --> 07:12.519
To go back to Bill Shady's quote, oh, Roger will let you handle it.

07:12.759 --> 07:13.941
I said, number one, he wouldn't.

07:14.225 --> 07:15.787
And I said, number two, it's not his.

07:15.927 --> 07:16.388
Exactly.

07:16.488 --> 07:17.329
He wouldn't let him.

07:17.409 --> 07:18.891
Are you kidding me?

07:18.911 --> 07:23.397
If I asked him if I could take out that Gutenberg and Daniel, he would have a hemorrhage.

07:23.597 --> 07:24.378
Why wouldn't he?

07:24.558 --> 07:25.840
He would just let him.

07:25.880 --> 07:29.044
He'd call a guard and have me arrested.

07:29.665 --> 07:34.851
So I think what you're trying to tell me is that maybe you feel an obligation to the next generation of collectibles?

07:34.891 --> 07:37.795
I feel an obligation to the next generation of collectibles.

07:37.815 --> 07:41.419
As Robert Ho said, by the way, he's got two Gutenberg guys.

07:41.840 --> 07:41.920
Yes.

07:42.575 --> 07:46.120
I have all of his catalogs, by the way.

07:46.200 --> 07:49.064
And I feel I can say that because we do give mostly everything else away.

07:50.065 --> 07:59.579
And therefore, I'm not really saying it because I'm really trying to say I'd love to make some money on what I put together because I've made a lot to do it.

08:00.921 --> 08:01.982
That isn't really the reason.

08:02.042 --> 08:03.725
And that's not a bad thing to do, incidentally.

08:03.945 --> 08:06.949
People should make money on what they... What are you wrong with that?

08:07.390 --> 08:11.215
But I do believe that cooks should go back into the hands of people who are going to

08:11.617 --> 08:34.992
love them and enjoy them and visit with them well robert always asked and it's in the first it's in the practice of the first catalog of the sale i said you know this is the greatest library ever put together certainly in north america one of the great libraries in the world why don't you send it to an institution and he said where would i be if it weren't for the collectors for other collectors

08:35.174 --> 08:40.021
He said, where would I have gotten my books that hadn't have been for other collections?

08:40.442 --> 08:42.545
And Bradley Martin said the same thing?

08:42.565 --> 08:43.686
Essentially the same thing.

08:44.287 --> 08:44.367
Yes.

08:44.387 --> 08:44.608
Yes.

08:45.048 --> 08:46.811
You know, well, come on.

08:46.851 --> 08:48.934
His Audubon, the wonderful, was not unique.

08:48.954 --> 08:50.376
He should have given his own a follow-up.

08:50.737 --> 08:51.077
Yes.

08:51.137 --> 08:52.359
See, that's different.

08:52.519 --> 08:57.827
When you put something so comprehensive together, you've got to give it.

08:57.967 --> 08:59.429
And where it cannot be replicated.

08:59.469 --> 08:59.950
Yes.

08:59.930 --> 09:01.533
That's, I totally agree.

09:01.553 --> 09:05.900
Now, therefore, you see, as wonderful as your collection is, it's extraordinary.

09:06.180 --> 09:08.043
There are other perispolios.

09:08.204 --> 09:08.745
That's right.

09:08.945 --> 09:11.549
Mine's a personal library, my own advertisement.

09:11.569 --> 09:15.756
It'd be fun to separate it and let other guys grab a little piece of it here, a little piece of it there.

09:16.037 --> 09:22.267
Now, I haven't asked money figures, and I'm not, but would you say that you've put more money into your other collecting areas than you have into your books?

09:22.988 --> 09:25.212
Well, only because I started 20 years earlier.

09:25.478 --> 09:31.926
I put a lot of money into my other stuff, but I put a good few million into the books already.

09:32.186 --> 09:33.908
I put millions into the books.

09:34.108 --> 09:38.754
I put a good few... I put some millions into the books.

09:39.374 --> 09:42.979
It's evident what people put into it.

09:43.079 --> 09:50.187
But the rest of the collection is... The other question.

09:50.740 --> 09:55.552
I gather also that you're a self-made guy.

09:57.076 --> 09:57.558
$60.

09:58.119 --> 10:01.027
I mean, because we started $60 paying for books on time.

10:01.588 --> 10:05.458
Not books, but... I started my business with $60.

10:06.063 --> 10:15.056
Did you know that this collector was waiting to be released?

10:15.076 --> 10:16.098
I had no idea.

10:16.118 --> 10:20.805
With the acquisition of his wealth.

10:21.005 --> 10:23.249
I'm dancing around.

10:23.269 --> 10:24.030
No, no, that's wonderful.

10:24.090 --> 10:25.632
Let me answer it.

10:25.652 --> 10:30.119
Let me answer it two ways.

10:30.139 --> 10:32.863
Number one, I read this somewhere.

10:32.843 --> 10:40.211
that most of the great collectors didn't become great collectors until they started to make some money so that they had some extraneous income.

10:41.612 --> 10:47.058
Then all of a sudden... I thought you didn't call it disposable income.

10:47.138 --> 10:47.779
No, I hate that.

10:47.819 --> 10:49.581
No, it's... No such thing is disposable.

10:49.761 --> 10:50.602
Isn't that the truth?

10:51.783 --> 10:57.349
Disposable income means that this money I don't really need, and so what I'm doing with it is unnecessary.

10:57.700 --> 10:58.441
disposable.

10:58.821 --> 10:59.602
That's a terrible thing.

10:59.642 --> 11:01.064
That's a contemptible word.

11:01.084 --> 11:04.547
I never thought of it in those terms, but you happen to be right.

11:04.567 --> 11:04.908
Very interesting.

11:04.928 --> 11:06.029
Well, it's true.

11:06.169 --> 11:06.750
You're right.

11:06.770 --> 11:07.511
Because you didn't say it.

11:07.691 --> 11:08.872
You didn't call it disposable.

11:08.992 --> 11:09.913
No, no, no.

11:10.073 --> 11:10.634
Extraneous.

11:10.714 --> 11:11.555
No, I'm saying it.

11:11.595 --> 11:12.136
You're right.

11:12.216 --> 11:12.836
Absolutely.

11:13.557 --> 11:23.488
And, well, you have, and if I sought out a word like extraneous, it's interesting you say it, then for sure I wasn't trying to get into the disposable

11:23.907 --> 11:53.593
trapped you know what i mean i also believe that you're it's obvious that you you've worked hard for what you have a man who is a person who has made himself nothing is disposable right i have a saying that some some people are lucky their father was born before them i'm not i'm not look go ahead continue but you've got a theory that i cut you off in explaining this thing yes you're answering me in two ways yes very good very good um

11:54.113 --> 11:56.576
What was the question?

11:56.597 --> 11:57.077
What makes collectors?

11:57.137 --> 11:57.438
Okay.

11:58.179 --> 12:03.086
I think what we were saying is that you started with 60 hours.

12:03.566 --> 12:05.028
You've been a very successful man.

12:05.970 --> 12:07.432
This collector has been released.

12:08.613 --> 12:09.755
I never knew he was there.

12:10.756 --> 12:12.599
And I think there's a lot of collectors out there.

12:14.021 --> 12:21.271
Fine collectors who've never realized what was lurking beneath the surface of their being.

12:22.173 --> 12:23.935
And obviously...

12:25.231 --> 12:26.612
It's a means of expression.

12:27.193 --> 12:29.295
You see, I'm not a creative person.

12:29.355 --> 12:30.016
Well, I shouldn't say that.

12:30.357 --> 12:35.442
I'm creative in many ways, business-wise.

12:37.204 --> 12:42.730
I'm creative in all the ways, except I'm not creative when it comes to art or writing.

12:43.471 --> 12:49.357
And I've never tried.

12:49.637 --> 12:53.061
I've never really attempted to draw, paint, or write.

12:53.918 --> 12:57.263
And I've always said there's something I really can't do, and therefore I've never tried.

12:57.924 --> 13:14.587
But what has supplanted that for me, what has given me my creativity, in quotes, so to speak, is the ability to recognize wonderful things and acquire them.

13:15.068 --> 13:17.030
To have the means to acquire them.

13:17.090 --> 13:18.853
To have the means to acquire them.

13:19.674 --> 13:19.814
Yeah.

13:20.675 --> 13:22.558
I guess what I'm saying is by...

13:22.859 --> 13:34.270
Acquiring something wonderful, and by having the pleasure that my wife and I have of donating something wonderful, that's my way of creating.

13:35.831 --> 13:38.934
Participating in the creative process.

13:39.154 --> 13:40.456
Yes, exactly.

13:40.876 --> 13:43.518
Participating in the creative process.

13:43.558 --> 13:44.459
Making it accessible.

13:44.680 --> 13:52.647
And being able to build a comprehensive collection, as we have, in many, many areas,

13:53.133 --> 14:02.163
which scholars and curators and dealers and other interested parties can come to to learn from, that's a creation.

14:03.164 --> 14:16.037
That's taking the great works and putting them in such a way and presenting them in such a way that other people can glean more information than from the individual work by itself, you see.

14:17.019 --> 14:20.542
And putting the package together is a creation.

14:21.463 --> 14:22.144
That's nice.

14:22.883 --> 14:23.984
We're going to wrap it up on that.

14:24.185 --> 14:24.585
I'm fine.

14:24.965 --> 14:25.987
Because you got a 215.

14:26.007 --> 14:26.487
No problem.

14:26.547 --> 14:28.069
If you're okay, I'm okay.

14:28.089 --> 14:28.570
Oh, I'm fine.

14:28.590 --> 14:33.075
Because we're going to talk again.

14:33.095 --> 14:34.036
We're going to talk again.

14:34.056 --> 14:35.458
I still want to do it.

14:35.478 --> 14:36.780
I will be a maniac.

14:36.820 --> 14:37.200
Well, yeah.

14:37.240 --> 14:40.644
Yes, in the sense that I continue.

14:41.345 --> 14:45.210
Anybody that makes every... Let me just put one step.

14:45.270 --> 14:45.750
All right?

14:46.111 --> 14:48.013
And it's in this article that I found at Harvard.

14:48.550 --> 14:50.293
And the guy has a wonderful two senses.

14:50.313 --> 14:53.238
He says, the bibliophile loves books.

14:53.439 --> 14:55.703
The bibliomaniac is a slave.

14:56.324 --> 15:00.111
That's a wonderful sense.

15:00.612 --> 15:03.617
I think I'm really a bibliophile, maybe.

15:03.677 --> 15:08.586
My bibliomania, I have a deep appreciation for books.

15:09.247 --> 15:10.710
I haunt bookshops.

15:11.078 --> 15:19.996
I make every book fair, from the smallest around the country to the largest around the world.

15:20.918 --> 15:28.253
And when I'm in London, during the book fair season, when they have about 20 different fairs going at the same time, I make every little cockamamie fair.

15:29.054 --> 15:32.361
I think the Leo Maniac, by the way, is a...

15:33.539 --> 15:34.562
I don't use that word.

15:34.583 --> 15:35.586
I'm not like Thomas Phillips.

15:35.666 --> 15:37.472
I don't want to quiet everything.

15:37.492 --> 15:39.298
I don't want to use that negatively.

15:39.318 --> 15:41.446
I think many of us are.

15:41.526 --> 15:43.151
I think that I am a bibliomania.

15:43.171 --> 15:44.295
I am a bibliomania.

15:44.355 --> 15:45.760
Yeah, because, I mean...

15:46.027 --> 15:50.633
You gave a quote to me a couple months back when we first started talking.

15:50.653 --> 15:56.582
And you said, people who know me know I'm going to get them.

15:56.602 --> 15:58.364
And we were talking about the auction.

15:58.384 --> 16:02.269
What was going through your mind when Marion said, think about it.

16:02.289 --> 16:10.260
And Marion thought that maybe he'd give you time to think about it because you're coming this far.

16:10.281 --> 16:10.901
And he told me.

16:11.042 --> 16:12.183
Are we on?

16:12.203 --> 16:13.425
Yeah, we're on.

16:13.445 --> 16:14.987
You don't want this on?

16:15.743 --> 16:23.189
Just so you'll remind me to tell you about the manuscript for Tegenev's Fathers and Sons.

16:23.209 --> 16:23.850
Oh, jeez.

16:23.870 --> 16:24.371
You got that?

16:24.931 --> 16:26.733
Do you remember when it was sold?

16:26.973 --> 16:31.096
You may have seen the catalog, but it was never sold in auction, but it was catalogued.

16:31.136 --> 16:31.457
Right.

16:32.157 --> 16:36.901
It's a great story about how we got the Russians to buy it.

16:36.941 --> 16:38.263
You're involved in this story?

16:38.283 --> 16:39.123
Yes.

16:39.143 --> 16:40.605
I'm watching myself with partners.

16:40.685 --> 16:42.026
I found it.

16:42.106 --> 16:44.128
I'm going to have this story.

16:44.148 --> 16:44.808
You have it this time?

16:44.988 --> 16:45.649
Yes.

16:46.186 --> 16:48.112
Which way are you going?

16:48.132 --> 16:51.984
I'm going back to Samarich and I can turn it around.

16:52.004 --> 16:52.827
Oh, I don't know.

16:52.907 --> 16:53.951
Forgive me.

16:54.191 --> 16:54.372
Samarich?

16:54.392 --> 16:55.014
That way.

16:55.034 --> 16:55.656
I'm all set.
