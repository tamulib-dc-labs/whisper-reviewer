00:09.008 --> 00:11.811
11.36 a.m.

00:11.951 --> 00:13.292
Line 1.

00:13.312 --> 00:14.874
Nick, good morning.

00:14.914 --> 00:19.399
This is Leon Monstein, and I'm replying to your letter of April 11th.

00:19.599 --> 00:22.642
Sorry, I've been away and didn't get to it sooner.

00:23.122 --> 00:29.669
But it's correct to deduct the whole $10,000 as your investment in Hanson technology.

00:29.709 --> 00:37.277
The business is no longer in business, and that you did contribute $10,000 in stock to that.

00:37.628 --> 00:41.665
And you can't deduct $3,000 off.

00:41.932 --> 00:44.756
three and a half years until you used up that loss.

00:44.776 --> 00:49.383
I'm trying to look for some old stationery so I can write you to this effect.

00:49.403 --> 00:53.309
And as soon as I find it, I will write you a letter on this.

00:53.710 --> 00:58.457
Thank you for everything and my regards to Connie, etc.

00:58.918 --> 01:00.320
Mary says her best.

01:00.340 --> 01:00.740
Thank you.

01:01.121 --> 01:09.694
If you have any questions, you can call me at Nero at 852-5553 or call me at home at night at

01:10.332 --> 01:11.954
892-4648.

01:12.335 --> 01:14.518
And I'd be happy to answer any questions.

01:14.538 --> 01:23.149
But meanwhile, we're going to be stationary so that we can tell you you can defect the entire amount of the $10,000 investment you made in Hanson technology.

01:23.229 --> 01:23.610
Thank you.

01:23.710 --> 01:25.012
Bye.

01:28.717 --> 01:32.762
Tuesday, 12, 34 p.m., line one.

01:33.316 --> 01:38.264
Nick, it's Alex Johnson, the author of A Hidden Writer, and you did the most wonderful, wonderful piece.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.408
My editor, I loved it.

01:40.428 --> 01:43.694
My editor really loved it because it kept popping up all over the United States.

01:43.854 --> 01:44.715
So I thank you.

01:45.456 --> 01:52.288
After we did our interview, I went on a pretty long book tour and then was away for all of August, getting back just around Labor Day.

01:52.308 --> 01:54.191
So I'm just returning your call.

01:54.211 --> 01:55.273
We would love to see you.

01:59.692 --> 02:03.578
Hi, this is Nick.

02:05.360 --> 02:06.322
It's 10 a.m.

02:06.342 --> 02:08.926
on January 22, 1998.

02:09.066 --> 02:25.770
I'm on my way to New York City for some book-related matters, listening to the New York Times Jazz Station, home of popular standards.

02:25.790 --> 02:27.673
And...

02:27.907 --> 02:47.088
Thought it might be a good time to just record a few thoughts on the work in progress, which we have tentatively titled Life Beyond Life, colon, book people, book places, book culture, comma, at the dawn of a new millennium.

02:48.290 --> 02:49.691
Or it could be at the dawn of a new era.

02:50.232 --> 02:52.795
Or it could be on the eve of a new millennium.

02:52.815 --> 02:53.476
We'll have to see.

02:53.516 --> 02:56.479
In any case, I have started to write the book.

02:57.050 --> 02:58.492
I have about 10,000 words.

02:59.834 --> 03:03.059
Not necessarily all clean, finished, polished words, but words nonetheless.

03:06.284 --> 03:19.865
And I'm hopeful that if I can keep up this pace, I can get the manuscript turned in, submitted by the end of this year.

03:20.867 --> 03:23.631
I hope perhaps even by October, but...

03:23.611 --> 03:28.396
With some luck, it'll be November.

03:29.176 --> 03:34.001
In which case, we will see the book published in 1998.

03:34.121 --> 03:42.349
In the case, that was a pretty difficult turn there, folks.

03:43.751 --> 03:49.276
Getting from 84 to 684, and I almost missed the turn.

03:52.339 --> 03:53.500
I was writing last night.

03:54.340 --> 04:06.777
working on the tentative outline, very rough outline of how these chapters might go.

04:08.980 --> 04:18.373
So we know already that we have a prologue that begins with Otto Bettman playing a Bach piece for Connie and me.

04:19.349 --> 04:20.931
in his apartment in Florida.

04:21.932 --> 04:23.153
And why Otto Bettman?

04:23.173 --> 04:29.060
Of course, because he is someone who touches every decade of the 20th century.

04:29.080 --> 04:30.282
He was born in 1903.

04:30.402 --> 04:36.929
And here we are, two years from the year 2000.

04:36.949 --> 04:41.735
And he's still alive and he's still thinking.

04:41.755 --> 04:42.396
And what was he?

04:42.416 --> 04:46.200
He was at one time a rare books librarian.

04:46.417 --> 04:48.400
in Germany.

04:49.181 --> 04:52.446
He's Jewish.

04:52.466 --> 04:56.672
He had to leave the country when Hitler took over in 1933.

04:56.692 --> 05:01.759
He had hoped at one point to be a publisher.

05:01.859 --> 05:14.618
So we have a librarian, a prospective publisher who did his PhD thesis on the German book trade prior to World War I.

05:16.133 --> 05:22.760
And what he did, of course, he came here with a Leica camera and a trunk full of photographs that he had made.

05:23.902 --> 05:28.106
He had begun making one when he was in Germany.

05:30.249 --> 05:44.605
And this enterprise became known as the Betman Archive, which was sold for many millions of dollars in the 1990s to Corpus, which is 100% owned by Bill Gates.

05:47.504 --> 05:51.050
I interviewed Otto over a two-day period in 1996.

05:51.191 --> 05:55.398
And he talked about books.

05:55.418 --> 05:56.420
He talked about images.

05:56.881 --> 05:58.944
He talked about the future.

05:58.964 --> 06:01.308
He talked about being an immigrant.

06:01.328 --> 06:09.423
And then when he played the organ for us, and it was a Bach piece, and I said to him, why Bach?

06:09.443 --> 06:10.204
And he said,

06:10.555 --> 06:16.060
Because Bach always comes back to where he began.

06:16.080 --> 06:22.466
We are going to have a chapter, possibly even two chapters, called Continuum.

06:22.486 --> 06:23.447
Continuum 1, Continuum 2.

06:23.607 --> 06:28.171
Or we will have two sections about Continuum 1, Continuum 2.

06:28.191 --> 06:28.532
I don't know.

06:28.572 --> 06:29.873
We'll have to see how this plays.

06:30.914 --> 06:33.516
We'll have to see how this plays in the lighting.

06:33.616 --> 06:37.440
But I have Otto playing the Bach piece.

06:38.551 --> 06:55.053
And then I will, in the prologue, and I will say a little bit about it, perhaps even four or five hundred words, and I will conclude that opening segment of Otto talking about the continuum.

06:55.073 --> 07:07.950
Also in the prologue, I will deal with my little anecdote from the Boston Athenaeum, the story I've told several times, many times in my

07:08.909 --> 07:12.533
and my addresses to various library groups.

07:15.275 --> 07:32.432
How as I was working feverishly to get the galleys and the gentle madness corrected, going back to New York and to get the book on track so we could get it published in time.

07:32.452 --> 07:38.038
I took out some books from the Athenaeum, which are 84 years old, the catalogs to the Peace Library.

07:38.187 --> 07:48.674
And I noticed as I was signing them out, the Athenaeum at that time, and in fact even today, still signs out books.

07:48.695 --> 07:54.610
I was able to determine that I was the first person in 84 years who had ever taken out these books.

07:55.349 --> 08:02.364
And as I was checking them out, I said, my goodness, you wonder who they bought these books for in the first place?

08:02.444 --> 08:09.139
And the man whose name I have to get, the gray-haired man, said to me, Wyatt, we bought them for you, sir.

08:10.081 --> 08:13.046
There's, you know, a statement that I came.

08:13.066 --> 08:15.429
That would end the prologue.

08:15.449 --> 08:17.232
We bought them for you, sir.

08:19.075 --> 08:27.549
Then, from there, we would go directly into what we have tentatively titled as Continuum One.

08:33.197 --> 08:34.840
And I will start...

08:35.444 --> 08:39.027
on the hill in Pergamum in Asia Minor.

08:39.047 --> 08:43.611
There to absorb the ambiance of this ancient Greek library.

08:43.631 --> 08:44.612
This is a place.

08:45.953 --> 08:50.818
And we will talk a little bit about this while we're there.

08:51.298 --> 09:01.387
And then we will sweep from Pergamum, perhaps over to the island of Patmos, where there is a library that continues to function.

09:03.429 --> 09:05.451
And from Patmos, maybe over to

09:06.730 --> 09:08.331
Mount Athos.

09:08.351 --> 09:10.874
This is really a medieval community.

09:12.115 --> 09:20.182
They are book people, it is a book place, and it is book culture.

09:20.302 --> 09:24.866
All at one site, all at one richly medieval exotic site.

09:25.727 --> 09:34.915
And working into this part most section, this will be, I suspect, the major thrust of attention in this opening chapter.

09:36.380 --> 09:37.181
Mount Athos.

09:38.843 --> 09:43.470
And there we can use the Robert Curzon Travels to the Levant.

09:44.111 --> 10:05.039
Record how when he was touring this part of the world in the 1830s, Lord Elgin at that same time was taking the marbles of the Acropolis, the Parthenon marbles from the Acropolis in Athens to England, which are the subject today.

10:05.079 --> 10:06.201
Very, very, very much.

10:06.839 --> 10:09.543
controversy and speculation.

10:09.563 --> 10:19.598
But he was getting manuscripts, and many, many of those manuscripts are now in the British Museum, British Library.

10:19.618 --> 10:22.602
So anyway, we used some of the quotes of Corazon.

10:22.623 --> 10:25.407
Maybe his observations intersposed them with mine.

10:27.910 --> 10:32.357
I think this will be a very wonderful segment of this opening chapter.

10:32.422 --> 10:41.035
And those first three places will more or less set the scene for the Continuum One chapter.

10:41.055 --> 11:01.905
I haven't yet decided how I'll move from there, but I suspect from Mount Athos and Patmos, both of which are on hills, we'll go directly to Monte Cassino, also on a hill, where

11:03.269 --> 11:06.554
the rule of Benedict was formulated where I went into this room.

11:08.577 --> 11:20.194
Make the point, Nick, that this abbey was virtually destroyed by Allied aircraft in World War II.

11:21.315 --> 11:22.537
And yet the book survived.

11:23.258 --> 11:24.880
The rules certainly survived.

11:26.803 --> 11:31.470
This cell, the room where Benedict formulated this rule, survived.

11:32.632 --> 11:35.316
Books survive.

11:35.336 --> 11:36.537
Places are destroyed.

11:38.220 --> 11:44.629
And so again, it's a question of the ambiance and the importance of why we go to Monte Cassino.

11:45.310 --> 11:47.573
We actually see books there that were made there.

11:48.734 --> 11:49.636
And the books survive.

11:50.336 --> 11:54.662
You might want to intersperse here the brief point.

11:55.363 --> 11:57.947
It recalls how this recalls

11:58.366 --> 12:12.626
The observation of Dr. Hennepad-Benz at the Gutenberg Museum at Lines, how none of Gutenberg's title has survived, none of his office records, not his press.

12:12.646 --> 12:14.909
All that we have, she said, is the book.

12:16.812 --> 12:18.154
But of course, what were they doing?

12:18.174 --> 12:20.817
It was the book.

12:20.837 --> 12:24.883
Okay, so from Monte Cassino, I think we'll shoot up to St.

12:25.003 --> 12:25.504
Gall.

12:28.083 --> 12:29.164
It's not the original library.

12:29.184 --> 12:36.133
We don't have an original cloister there, but it's very important, isn't it?

12:36.153 --> 12:38.395
Because that is where St.

12:38.435 --> 12:39.997
Columba came.

12:40.458 --> 12:41.679
And we will talk about Columba.

12:41.699 --> 12:44.282
We will develop him as a personality.

12:46.965 --> 12:53.053
And we will explain the significance of the rule, of the plan of the Abbey at St.

12:53.253 --> 12:55.896
Gaul, which was a model

12:58.390 --> 13:21.803
Abbey, which was put into effect for the making of scriptoria around Europe and for the preservation and transmission of knowledge.

13:21.823 --> 13:23.164
From St.

13:23.184 --> 13:26.229
Gaul, I think I'll shoot over to England, Durham Cathedral.

13:26.249 --> 13:27.891
We're still in our continuum phase.

13:28.850 --> 13:34.498
There are cloisters there, beautiful cloisters, apparently.

13:34.518 --> 13:35.199
We'll do that.

13:35.319 --> 13:37.182
It's a cathedral library.

13:37.202 --> 13:57.692
It is the only cathedral library, apparently, that survived Henry VIII's program of the dissolution of the monasteries, beginning in 1536.

14:00.693 --> 14:02.975
So that's very important.

14:02.995 --> 14:10.682
And then I think down we'll go to Hereford Chain Library, bring in the fittings, the study of libraries, a wonderful book that you have.

14:10.702 --> 14:12.524
We want to talk about fittings.

14:13.785 --> 14:29.400
And then I guess we'll go back to Italy, to this nice big sweeping segment that I plan on the Italian libraries, like this string of pearls that stretches across the top of Italy.

14:30.258 --> 14:43.933
the Ambrosiana, the Capicillare, the Libreria di Malatestina in Chechnya, the Biblioteca Menecea Lorenziana in Florence.

14:44.074 --> 14:46.757
I think you have four exquisite libraries.

14:47.157 --> 14:59.691
And I think the idea here is to write about Italy as a nation of libraries, diverse libraries, the rich, the rich, pulsing cultural heritage that you find that these libraries represent.

15:00.127 --> 15:05.596
You know, certainly we have the Pope and religion, and what did we learn when we were at the Ambosiana?

15:05.616 --> 15:19.019
That there are more than a thousand, one thousand, ecclesiastic libraries accounting for the number I believe is 27 million books in Italy.

15:19.821 --> 15:24.008
And this does not count, this does not include the Vatican Library.

15:24.427 --> 15:33.343
which quite technically is not Italy, it's Vatican City, and it is an ecclesiastic library, but it's the library of the Vatican, of the Catholic Church.

15:33.363 --> 15:38.072
And then you have six or so national libraries in Italy.

15:38.092 --> 15:39.575
We only have one in the United States.

15:39.595 --> 15:40.617
Why do they have six?

15:40.637 --> 15:45.085
Because Italy has only been a nation for about 125 years.

15:46.499 --> 15:47.820
And so you have that spread out.

15:47.840 --> 15:49.883
Then you have some interesting university libraries.

15:50.904 --> 15:59.433
And of course these individual libraries that have survived really are quite unique.

15:59.453 --> 16:00.114
And so that's Italia.

16:01.535 --> 16:02.516
We finish Italia.

16:04.819 --> 16:05.700
And then we'll go to Spain.

16:06.160 --> 16:09.664
And we'll do the Biblioteca Colabina.

16:09.684 --> 16:11.646
Christopher Columbus's son founded it.

16:12.824 --> 16:17.088
the first library in Europe, apparently, to have been built with American money.

16:17.628 --> 16:33.763
And also you wish to make the point that the history of America, at least so far as Europeans are concerned, the European history of America, is bracketed by the history of print.

16:33.783 --> 16:42.291
Columbus, we must recall, his father, announced his discovery in the form of a letter that was printed.

16:42.608 --> 16:49.574
To say all this, the history of North America is bracketed by printing.

16:49.594 --> 16:54.379
It has been an ongoing history that has not only been documented, but printed.

16:56.701 --> 17:06.250
And some of that, a slice of that, is at this library and also over at the Archive of the Indians.

17:06.470 --> 17:09.713
I think at this point, we've kind of done

17:11.380 --> 17:13.542
the front part of Continuum One.

17:14.803 --> 17:32.561
Whether we close this chapter at around this point or we shoot it over to the British Library, the new one, the new French Library, the new German Library, the new Swedish Library.

17:32.601 --> 17:35.744
Libraries are going up all over the world right now.

17:35.865 --> 17:39.328
Millions and millions of dollars are being spent on libraries.

17:40.810 --> 17:43.454
So our library as repository is dead?

17:45.637 --> 17:49.243
Well, the evidence certainly doesn't indicate that at all, does it?

17:49.263 --> 17:53.970
We'll hold on to the epilogue of the book.

17:53.990 --> 17:58.516
And I don't know whether or not we'll mention it in the forelog.

17:59.017 --> 18:04.766
But certainly when we're discussing Patmos, we have to mention that how it came up as a rival to Alexandria.

18:07.930 --> 18:09.653
And we talk about Alexandria.

18:11.455 --> 18:20.064
And we'll mention here that really no trace of that original library remains.

18:20.525 --> 18:21.286
Can't leave it there.

18:21.466 --> 18:29.094
And then in the prologue, we'll return to that part of the world, and we will be on that site.

18:31.237 --> 18:39.606
And there on that site is the brand new Alexandrian library being built, being erected.

18:40.868 --> 18:43.612
and taking us into the 21st century.

18:44.854 --> 18:51.103
And like Bach, and like Otto Bettman says, we return to where we started.

18:52.966 --> 19:01.338
So we've got the prologue, we've got chapter one, we've got the epilogue.

19:01.358 --> 19:08.428
I believe at this time, I would move immediately into the chapter on booksellers.

19:09.877 --> 19:37.335
And as I indicated in the outline I prepared last night, booksellers we will include in this will be Pierre Perez, Carlo Alberto Chiesa, John Maggs, Nico Israel, Max Israel, Peter Howard, Bill Reese,

19:38.260 --> 19:42.424
You need a woman, possibly Christina Juvenas.

19:42.444 --> 19:46.567
We want to talk about the scholarly tradition of bookseller.

19:47.809 --> 19:49.970
You've got a lot of literature at home, a lot of material.

19:50.891 --> 19:53.173
Check the database.

19:53.193 --> 19:55.255
Check the books that you purchased.

19:55.275 --> 20:06.225
You want some sense of continuity, of continuum again, of the tradition of the bookseller as scholar, the bookseller learning things, the bookseller passing on.

20:09.192 --> 20:18.626
his knowledge, her knowledge, gleaned from a bibliographical investigation into a book.

20:18.646 --> 20:20.890
That's what the book is when it's important.

20:20.910 --> 20:23.053
Oh, my goodness, you know, we forgot Rustenberg and Stern.

20:24.115 --> 20:26.739
Rustenberg and Stern go in there, by all means.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.441
Terrible attention goes in there.

20:29.363 --> 20:35.512
Steve Weissman goes in there.

20:35.532 --> 20:37.495
And then, I'm not sure...

20:37.762 --> 20:48.072
whether we go from that chapter to the emigres, whether the emigres are part of this, or we start with the emigres and go to this.

20:48.292 --> 20:51.455
I think we do this and then we'll do the emigres.

20:54.919 --> 21:06.570
There are no survivors other than the FEMA, but we do have the recollections of Marguerite Goldschmidt,

21:09.200 --> 21:15.527
and her husband, and the woman over in Queens on Offenbacher.

21:17.229 --> 21:23.517
I hope at some point to talk to Mary Ann Krause about her father.

21:23.537 --> 21:26.680
Otto Bettman works in here again, even though he wasn't a bookseller.

21:26.700 --> 21:27.862
He's from the tradition.

21:29.404 --> 21:36.692
We have Steve Schuler's Harvard PhD thesis, where he

21:37.246 --> 21:47.265
has information on Walter Johnson and Schatzky and Helen Wolfe, the immigrate publishers.

21:47.966 --> 21:57.744
So, in the aspect of the immigrates, it will not be focused strictly on the books.

21:57.764 --> 22:00.790
Oh, I forgot Barney Rosenthal and I forgot Fred Schreiber.

22:01.597 --> 22:10.592
Bonnie Rosenthal and Fred Scheiber are booksellers who have to be in these front two chapters and in Bonnie's history.

22:11.333 --> 22:14.258
Bonnie's history is very important.

22:14.278 --> 22:15.840
The Israel history is very important.

22:16.882 --> 22:20.268
The Crow's history is very important.

22:20.288 --> 22:24.735
In each of those cases, we have generational booksellers.

22:27.179 --> 22:49.103
probably booksellers and then lost the burgers during the year too and everybody loved that story and that could pretty much come out of what we did for biblio so that's done all right that's three chapters from this one i'd kind of like to go to

22:50.062 --> 22:52.045
I think we have good materials at this point.

22:52.065 --> 22:58.296
Good, exciting, engaging, anecdotal material.

22:58.316 --> 23:00.600
A lot of narrative possibilities here.

23:02.964 --> 23:05.007
Let's go straight to the office.

23:05.027 --> 23:06.530
Reading.

23:06.550 --> 23:07.251
Start with reading.

23:07.712 --> 23:11.939
Go to the office.

23:11.999 --> 23:15.305
Umberto Eco.

23:15.325 --> 23:16.086
Ella Bloom.

23:19.492 --> 23:23.299
Stephen J. Gould, Timmy Olson.

23:23.319 --> 23:24.341
Robert Coles.

23:24.361 --> 23:25.763
We've got to put Robert Coles.

23:25.843 --> 23:28.508
Where do we put Robert Coles?

23:28.568 --> 23:31.473
Stories that you can live your life on and children.

23:32.575 --> 23:36.682
That reading study from Boston where books have been prescribed.

23:36.702 --> 23:42.192
And you know that little segment I wrote last night about Stephen Cusisto?

23:42.593 --> 23:45.157
where reading was dangerous to his health?

23:45.177 --> 23:52.489
How about pairing that immediately, immediately with that story out of Boston on books being prescribed as medicine?

23:52.509 --> 23:54.632
You know?

23:55.774 --> 23:58.439
Books dangerous, physically?

23:58.459 --> 24:04.689
How about books therapeutic, medically?

24:04.709 --> 24:07.133
I would pair those two stories together.

24:07.153 --> 24:09.917
Two stories that broke within weeks of each other.

24:10.623 --> 24:24.044
literally within weeks of each other in January of 1998.

24:24.064 --> 24:27.009
All right, let's use that device.

24:27.029 --> 24:27.470
Let's use that device.

24:27.490 --> 24:35.803
In January of 1998, within weeks of each other, two seemingly disparate cultural stories, one in the form of a book, the other in form of an article in the New York Times,

24:37.960 --> 24:43.690
raise the issue of books, of reading, of reading.

24:45.393 --> 24:50.721
And the concept is, are they hazardous to your health on the one hand?

24:50.742 --> 24:55.149
And do they help you grow or nurture you on the other?

24:55.169 --> 24:56.752
That's really, I like that a lot.

24:56.892 --> 24:59.957
That sounds really, really good.

24:59.977 --> 25:02.922
Let's use that in the reading, and then we'll get into

25:03.239 --> 25:09.685
Echo, don't forget now you haven't written yet the Jean-Paul Sartre segment on reading.

25:09.785 --> 25:12.828
We haven't done the Virginia Woolf yet.

25:13.069 --> 25:17.973
You have to do that.

25:17.993 --> 25:20.356
Stephen Jay Gould, you have one transcript for him.

25:20.376 --> 25:22.958
I recommend you transcribe that other tape pretty quickly.

25:26.402 --> 25:29.184
So now we've got four chapters plus a co-log.

25:29.204 --> 25:31.947
We've got the co-log, we've got the continual one,

25:33.395 --> 25:43.247
And we've got the two bookseller segments, one including the emigres, the other based on the Europeans, and now we get into reading.

25:43.988 --> 25:45.190
So that's four.

25:45.210 --> 25:48.333
Reading, again, very anecdotal.

25:48.353 --> 25:56.884
So, in the first four chapters, we've established a continuum, we've established the places, book places and libraries.

25:56.904 --> 25:58.626
We have a number of book people.

26:00.445 --> 26:06.212
And book culture is evident by everything that we've described.

26:06.232 --> 26:06.813
Of course, reading.

26:08.235 --> 26:14.283
Be alert to all the great quotes that you've picked up in your LFS interviews about reading.

26:14.303 --> 26:21.011
You know, when they came to me last night, I certainly don't want to forget it.

26:21.172 --> 26:25.457
Andre Brink, who was banned in his own country,

26:25.808 --> 26:29.273
which describes what it's like to be a writer without a country.

26:29.293 --> 26:30.855
A writer without a country.

26:30.955 --> 26:32.277
A writer without a reader.

26:33.138 --> 26:34.901
A writer without a reader.

26:37.204 --> 26:42.711
And thus it came to pass that he wrote all of his books himself in two languages.

26:43.873 --> 26:45.535
He does not consider this translation.

26:45.736 --> 26:52.104
He considers this two separate works of the literary imagination, each of which that he has done.

26:52.124 --> 26:54.668
And there are textures that he does differently.

26:55.070 --> 27:01.339
Contrast that with what Peter Carey told you about being an Australian writer who lives in America.

27:03.142 --> 27:06.226
And who does he write for?

27:06.447 --> 27:07.809
What, the reader here in America?

27:08.009 --> 27:09.271
Or the reader that matters?

27:09.331 --> 27:14.258
The reader that matters is the one in Australia.

27:14.278 --> 27:14.899
So that's good.

27:15.320 --> 27:16.081
That's really good.

27:16.101 --> 27:18.244
We've got those two there.

27:18.264 --> 27:21.509
I really definitely think they work together.

27:21.529 --> 27:24.233
But the writer and his reader, Carey's quote,

27:24.787 --> 27:31.334
The canon, it is ultimately the reader, not the critic, creates the canon.

27:33.177 --> 27:35.439
I like that quote a lot.

27:35.459 --> 27:40.385
And Robert Coles, as I said, goes in the writer's chapter.

27:42.027 --> 27:44.189
I would also put Robert Fagles in there.

27:45.130 --> 27:46.812
There's got Helen Vendler.

27:48.243 --> 27:59.817
You know, we have some vague overlap here between these writers, between the reader, and between the canon discussion, the literary canon.

27:59.837 --> 28:01.299
You know, I think we'll go with what we have.

28:01.359 --> 28:03.181
We'll summarize what's going on.

28:04.803 --> 28:05.804
The concept of text.

28:05.824 --> 28:16.056
You can bring in here that LexisNexis item that you found, where they are outsourcing the selection of books for their libraries.

28:16.627 --> 28:27.216
or they are doing research to determine the core collection of fiction for a public library.

28:27.236 --> 28:33.682
You know, detail, this is all detail that you want to get.

28:33.702 --> 28:39.687
Again, pay attention, look at your database.

28:39.707 --> 28:44.572
So I think we've got about five chapters here.

28:44.592 --> 28:45.132
But,

28:45.938 --> 28:47.280
sequences, everything.

28:48.521 --> 28:58.654
So from the reader, let's go straight to Harvard, the Harvard Cornell chapter.

28:58.674 --> 29:12.891
Harvard Cornell with strong backup support from Berkeley, Stanford, Virginia, Michigan, Illinois, Brown,

29:13.276 --> 29:15.838
You were at Dartmouth, Columbia, Utah.

29:18.561 --> 29:19.382
Minor Myers.

29:20.983 --> 29:24.667
That new university down there in Florida that was just opened in 1997.

29:24.727 --> 29:30.252
They outsourced the formation of a library.

29:30.272 --> 29:40.802
You know about the new California College of Monterey that was going to build its place without even having a building for books.

29:41.930 --> 29:46.976
We've got that man in San Diego who has worked at stock libraries with books.

29:46.996 --> 29:49.418
The whole idea of books, how do they matter?

29:49.438 --> 29:50.820
Do numbers matter?

29:51.380 --> 29:55.765
The Harvard Depository kind of gets to this, the last copy policy.

29:56.806 --> 29:59.129
And so we'll go from that.

30:01.472 --> 30:05.957
Let's go to the San Francisco Public Library story.

30:05.977 --> 30:09.000
This does bring up the question now of technology, doesn't it?

30:10.685 --> 30:19.638
So next we'll do San Francisco Public Library and Technology, and that's the case study.

30:19.658 --> 30:24.605
I can bring in here other public libraries, New York, certainly.

30:27.008 --> 30:32.676
The town of Parker, both culture, a good place.

30:36.824 --> 30:38.366
You'd have to mention Boston.

30:38.386 --> 30:40.608
Maybe you'll go to a couple of new public libraries.

30:40.628 --> 30:42.290
You've got one in Fort Lauderdale.

30:42.310 --> 30:44.833
You've got one in San Antonio.

30:44.853 --> 30:52.923
I mean, you'll visit these things, but you certainly want to mention them, and you certainly want to know about them and include them in there.

30:52.943 --> 31:00.372
From here, we'll go to, um, from specific to general.

31:00.792 --> 31:04.837
Try and balance this specific to general, specific to general.

31:04.857 --> 31:06.679
Now, wherever we put Lloyd Colson,

31:07.064 --> 31:10.971
I think he has to follow very closely to the colleges.

31:10.991 --> 31:15.980
So after the colleges, let's go to Post.

31:16.000 --> 31:22.733
After the Harvard, Cornell, et cetera chapter, let's go to Lloyd Coates.

31:22.753 --> 31:23.875
And these are the

31:24.445 --> 31:29.710
Chapters that I envision being a lot like the Texas A.M.O.

31:29.830 --> 31:30.051
Moore.

31:31.032 --> 31:42.243
I have a number of chapters in Gentle Madness where they are very focused.

31:42.263 --> 31:42.684
They're not episodic.

31:42.704 --> 31:48.990
They're also thinking, which has not been researched yet, but a book arts chapter.

31:49.010 --> 31:53.895
Be sure to include Terry Belanger in the book arts press in Risky, Virginia with this.

31:54.601 --> 32:01.611
And I would start this chapter with Joe Jacobson at the MIT Media Lab.

32:02.833 --> 32:15.912
The MIT Media Lab is showing me an electronic book that looks like a book, has pages like a book, but can load up to 3,000 books.

32:15.932 --> 32:17.314
That's a book.

32:17.454 --> 32:18.115
That's very interesting.

32:18.135 --> 32:23.663
It presages the future, but it also allows us to then go off and write about.

32:24.318 --> 32:32.087
I think prior to the writing of this, we'll do bibliography.

32:32.888 --> 32:36.953
We're going to do an interview with Tom Tantel and Alice Schreier.

32:40.156 --> 32:41.098
We have Father Boyle.

32:41.418 --> 32:42.319
We have Art B. Hanneman.

32:42.339 --> 32:45.803
We have Carol Fitzgerald, who basically has written.

32:46.863 --> 32:49.387
We've got Owen Newbridge of the Aquinas Project.

32:49.467 --> 32:59.502
Don't forget to mention the project of the Mass Historical Society on the Adams papers.

32:59.522 --> 33:04.549
Tom Tanzel will tell you the bibliographic projects.

33:04.569 --> 33:10.879
We've got Tom Staley of the University of Texas, Austin, the HRC.

33:10.899 --> 33:14.524
He's got the story there on

33:17.120 --> 33:20.905
I think D.H.

33:20.925 --> 33:22.887
Lawrence, Ulysses, that are there.

33:22.908 --> 33:30.597
Could they do a headwind collated type of project with that book?

33:30.618 --> 33:31.559
You know, we have to get into deaccessioning.

33:31.579 --> 33:40.110
Now, either we do deaccessioning with San Francisco and Harvard.

33:40.130 --> 33:44.415
Yeah, it would work, doesn't it?

33:44.435 --> 33:45.357
We got David Stamm.

33:45.377 --> 33:46.418
I think David Stamm will come in

33:46.972 --> 33:53.918
in the Harvard Cornell.

33:54.539 --> 34:07.571
And when we're discussing the New York and San Francisco Public Library, that's where you bring in Paula Clare.

34:07.591 --> 34:08.011
Paula Clare comes in.

34:08.031 --> 34:09.453
That's where Padme comes in, too.

34:09.473 --> 34:13.817
But the deaccessioning question and the preservation question comes in again.

34:14.798 --> 34:16.219
But the real issues of

34:16.823 --> 34:29.636
over accessioning and preservation, really preservation, is to be picked up in the National Libraries.

34:32.158 --> 34:34.881
And we will do that with L.C.

34:34.921 --> 34:36.082
We got good quotes there.

34:37.603 --> 34:39.525
We have good quotes from the British Library.

34:39.605 --> 34:41.207
We have good quotes from the French Library.

34:41.427 --> 34:44.350
We have excellent on-site from

34:45.106 --> 34:59.006
We might even want to start in Bucherei, Leipzig, in this whole preservation discussion.

35:00.669 --> 35:14.168
So I've done the readers, I've done canon, heritage, culture, and I don't know what chapter will be the concluding chapter yet.

35:15.886 --> 35:20.497
Something strong, something good, better than Nick Manning, certainly.

35:21.139 --> 35:28.016
Maybe the National Libraries' Repositories of Culture and History, because it says Continuum, too.

35:28.036 --> 35:28.878
It's a continuum.

35:28.979 --> 35:33.169
It's a really focus on the heritage of the National Libraries.

35:33.605 --> 35:36.610
So that will be your concluding chapter.

35:38.353 --> 35:48.969
And then it will allow us to segue you neatly into an epilogue, and the epilogue will be at Alexandria and the New Library.

35:48.989 --> 35:55.680
So there I think you have ten very strong, integrated, interrelated

35:56.048 --> 35:56.789
Chapters.

35:58.552 --> 36:00.896
And we don't mean to forget anything.

36:00.916 --> 36:06.505
I would suggest check your calendar from last year, see who you interviewed, LFS as well as LBL.

36:08.909 --> 36:14.517
And write them all down on your outline.

36:14.598 --> 36:17.863
As fragmentary as it is.

36:18.684 --> 36:20.487
Okay, I just got onto the hutch.

36:21.580 --> 36:26.469
And this has been a good conversation, and now I'm going to go take a leap.

36:27.130 --> 36:28.673
Thanks.

36:32.319 --> 36:34.322
One thing I want to add, I'm back on the road again.

36:35.284 --> 36:44.280
I don't believe I mentioned Toronto and the Fisher Rare Books Library, but how the University of Toronto serves as a de facto national library in Canada.

36:44.497 --> 36:46.821
It really is not a national library, per se.

36:46.841 --> 36:49.505
There is a National Archives, but there's a national library.

36:52.489 --> 37:02.124
The University of Toronto, and I do believe the University of Vancouver, but we'll have to check that out, or British Columbia or something out there on the West Coast works.

37:03.847 --> 37:10.217
There's another kind of national library, but there are two major depository libraries for books in Canada.

37:10.400 --> 37:16.634
I also want to mention, you know, I never even got into the last one about the emigre libraries.

37:18.518 --> 37:23.970
We talked about the emigres who came here.

37:24.507 --> 37:29.634
as booksellers, but I didn't mention the Emigre Library, the concept of the Emigre Library.

37:29.654 --> 37:31.677
That's so important.

37:31.857 --> 37:40.749
And Cornell's work with the Cambodia Archives, that could either go into digital, or it could go into Cornell, or it could go into Emigre.

37:41.230 --> 37:47.358
I don't think it's Emigre, per se, because the Cambodians really didn't bring that stuff here with them.

37:47.378 --> 37:51.063
It came here through other means.

37:51.143 --> 37:53.907
The university had agents who acquired it and bought it here.

37:54.224 --> 37:58.290
We also want to write about... I forgot to mention Sarajevo.

37:58.350 --> 38:03.978
There's a whole other chapter, so actually now we'll have to... I've forgotten all about that.

38:04.018 --> 38:09.605
There's Kimmel McCartney describing the destruction and the bombing of Sarajevo.

38:12.730 --> 38:20.721
Now, could that go into the... Boy, that could go... That could go into the National Libraries.

38:21.393 --> 38:30.421
You know, unless you come up with something else, unless we actually do ultimately go and develop a chapter on Eastern European book culture.

38:31.882 --> 38:35.345
And I still, to this point, do not wish to preclude a trip to St.

38:35.365 --> 38:39.689
Petersburg.

38:39.709 --> 38:44.173
I'd love to do it, really, and to talk to some people.

38:44.193 --> 38:49.898
But I do, I do have the Paul Magliucci, the Edward Kassanek,

38:50.317 --> 38:51.959
in the John Simmons interviews.

38:55.864 --> 38:58.948
You know, yeah, yeah, Sarajevo, emigre.

39:01.552 --> 39:04.536
Destruction.

39:04.556 --> 39:07.379
Destruction and fighting destruction.

39:09.362 --> 39:20.256
Sarajevo, Cambodia, the Republic of Georgia, San Lorenzo in Venice, the Armenians, the Kurds desperate to find

39:21.333 --> 39:22.555
to preserve their culture.

39:22.595 --> 39:23.757
They have no library.

39:24.438 --> 39:26.340
Talk to that woman in New York who did that book.

39:29.545 --> 39:32.470
So he definitely, how could you possibly forget Sarajevo?

39:34.833 --> 39:35.835
So you got Sarajevo.

39:37.998 --> 39:38.979
Book stories.

39:38.999 --> 39:46.510
Book stories as we approach the new millennium, which elucidate a boy.

39:46.530 --> 39:49.635
So, you know, pal, you could have here 11 chapters.

39:50.797 --> 40:01.668
And of the 11 that you've just outlined, I'm sure that you could make a 12, because it sounds to me like a lot of this material could spin off.

40:04.130 --> 40:08.615
At the moment, I don't know how to begin the Sarajevo one.

40:08.655 --> 40:16.403
Maybe, maybe, you know, but I want to use the image of Christine Lachman, the burning of books.

40:16.423 --> 40:20.567
You want to really get the destruction of books

40:21.307 --> 40:24.772
the destruction of libraries through history.

40:25.192 --> 40:27.235
Remember the quote that Martin Gregorian told us?

40:28.777 --> 40:31.341
The murder of memory, the destruction of memory.

40:34.365 --> 40:45.861
Now, that could really go into the whole, we could hold that in with the national libraries, because this was a national library.

40:46.842 --> 40:48.084
And don't forget Poland.

40:48.224 --> 40:49.286
There was no Poland.

40:49.306 --> 40:50.908
What did Martin Gregorian tell us?

40:51.513 --> 40:55.019
Where was the de facto National Library of Poland?

40:55.039 --> 40:57.423
It was in Paris, and it's still there.

40:59.887 --> 41:10.805
And the Georgians, when they were forced out by fellow Georgian Stalin, they went to Paris and they deposited their papers at Houghton Library until there was a New Georgia.

41:12.007 --> 41:13.509
Well, that's terrific stuff, my friend.

41:14.110 --> 41:16.635
That's really good stuff.

41:16.655 --> 41:18.077
So remember using all of that.

41:19.036 --> 41:23.701
folding it into the National Library chapter.

41:24.682 --> 41:25.602
That's good.

41:25.683 --> 41:27.965
So, I don't like odd.

41:28.045 --> 41:29.566
I like even.

41:29.586 --> 41:33.110
So either it's going to be 10 chapters or a dozen chapters.

41:34.251 --> 41:35.252
What's wrong with a dozen?

41:35.852 --> 41:36.353
You can do it.

41:36.994 --> 41:42.299
Gentle Madness was a 14-chapter book.

41:42.399 --> 41:48.705
A dozen chapters are 10,000 to 15,000 words each.

41:49.360 --> 42:01.037
You've got yourself close to a 200,000-word book, plus notes, plus bibliography, plus sign.

42:01.057 --> 42:02.659
So don't forget your Sarajevo.

42:03.941 --> 42:07.006
It'd be nice if you could go there on this trip, but I don't think you can.

42:07.026 --> 42:11.853
C'est la vie.

42:11.873 --> 42:13.235
But we'll have to get some photographs.

42:14.296 --> 42:16.079
We've talked to the people.

42:16.099 --> 42:18.422
And we talked to Kemmel when he was here.

42:19.988 --> 42:21.350
You know, you could start in the morning.

42:22.571 --> 42:25.514
Kimmel McCarsick and I are having drinks.

42:27.337 --> 42:29.960
That legal seafood of Brooklyn, he's here.

42:29.980 --> 42:35.286
He's trying to elicit help to rebuild his library, to rebuild his collections.

42:35.746 --> 42:37.629
He's been to the White House with Hillary Clinton.

42:40.592 --> 42:48.401
And they are working on, this is where you bring in OCLC, to replicate their collections.

42:48.421 --> 42:49.843
To replicate their collections.

42:51.089 --> 43:11.518
digitally and also to try and find copies of books or manuscripts really that people had possibly have made when they were doing research and if they could send them back to Sarajevo.

43:11.858 --> 43:16.665
That's a very, very, very, very important chapter on a concept.

43:18.027 --> 43:18.868
Preservation.

43:19.996 --> 43:42.721
digitization, scanning, technology, the technology aspects, trithemius, the future of the book, the shape of the book, the culture of the book, and really the twelfth chapter I gave you, the twelfth one would be the interactive fiction.

43:42.741 --> 43:44.383
And that doesn't have to be that long.

43:44.836 --> 43:48.300
or that may even work in some place else.

43:48.621 --> 43:51.224
But we've been talking to the authors.

43:51.845 --> 43:55.349
You know, I think the interactive fiction can go in the office.

43:55.389 --> 44:05.241
They could go in Bob Cooper, in the holodeck, in the paper.

44:06.183 --> 44:07.024
Microchips.

44:08.706 --> 44:12.912
Don't forget your papyrus item.

44:12.932 --> 44:20.022
That book that you saw from the Boston Athenaeum.

44:20.042 --> 44:22.185
Nobody knows who invented papyrus.

44:23.186 --> 44:34.502
I've got to go over to WIS shortly to hear that news conference, but

44:34.735 --> 44:51.463
Even after they invented papyrus, the Egyptian pharaohs still insisted on documenting their important matter in stone, carved in stone because it would last, or baked them on tablets because it would last.

44:53.266 --> 44:56.492
And then what did that young man tell us at the Gutenberg Museum and Mines?

44:57.173 --> 45:00.338
Frederick II insisted that all important documents

45:00.588 --> 45:02.794
be preserved on parchment and not paper.

45:04.017 --> 45:11.899
So we do have this resistance to technological change at every spot through history.

45:11.919 --> 45:13.804
All right, let's leave it there for the moment.
