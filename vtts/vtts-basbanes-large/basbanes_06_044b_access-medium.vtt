WEBVTT

00:04.975 --> 00:07.960
It makes it useful for me.

00:08.642 --> 00:10.585
I will say this with the machine running.

00:11.046 --> 00:13.891
I promise you that we'll go over your stuff.

00:14.532 --> 00:15.554
It's about a year before.

00:15.574 --> 00:18.700
I have a year to read the book.

00:18.720 --> 00:23.508
I hope it'll certainly be before that.

00:23.528 --> 00:23.929
I will.

00:24.179 --> 00:28.104
I'll want to go over the stuff, and certainly if you want to change a quote.

00:28.144 --> 00:34.632
I'd like to say, for accuracy's sake, I have to... It's fine with me, too.

00:34.672 --> 00:39.638
You'll probably have to try the spellings of these names of people and all sorts of strings.

00:39.658 --> 00:43.643
The biggest pain in the ass is transcribing it.

00:43.723 --> 00:44.865
Sure.

00:44.885 --> 00:49.050
But it is good to have it accurate.

00:49.070 --> 00:53.275
Tell me a little bit about the Mulholland collection.

00:55.229 --> 00:56.651
Is there a catalog for that, by the way?

00:56.671 --> 00:59.014
No, there's not a printed catalog.

00:59.555 --> 01:03.059
We've been working on cataloging it since we've done it.

01:04.761 --> 01:13.472
Well, John Mulholland was this New York-based magician and writer, teacher at Horace Mann, who started collecting as a boy.

01:13.492 --> 01:17.878
I think the first purchases he made were about 1913.

01:18.668 --> 01:21.931
And he knew the major figures of his day.

01:22.012 --> 01:25.936
Howard Thurston, the great magician of his day, was particularly friendly with him, as was Houdini.

01:25.956 --> 01:30.040
I mean, a lot of the treasures in the Mulholland Library came from Houdini personally.

01:30.100 --> 01:32.963
Houdini clearly liked Mulholland a great deal.

01:32.983 --> 01:38.049
And at that time, Houdini was the most active collector in this field.

01:38.349 --> 01:44.315
So this collection was built for a long time by Mulholland, who eventually became the editor of what was the best journal in magic.

01:44.336 --> 01:45.257
It was called The Sphinx.

01:45.577 --> 01:48.540
And for a long, long time, Mulholland was the editor of it.

01:49.128 --> 01:55.778
And he wrote articles on the history of magic, also published books on the history of magic, some of which are, you know, around and still quite good.

01:56.199 --> 02:02.428
But where familiar spirits is a wonderful account of spirit wrapping and fraudulent mediums and quicker than the eye.

02:02.448 --> 02:04.812
I mean, he was very good at this.

02:04.832 --> 02:07.656
And this collection built and built.

02:07.756 --> 02:15.127
And because of his position as the editor of the Sphinx, he was receiving all of the contemporary books of the day, usually with incredibly elaborate inscriptions.

02:15.828 --> 02:18.392
And many of the things in his library had wonderful provenance.

02:18.963 --> 02:22.229
And in 1966, he brought this over to the Players Club.

02:22.469 --> 02:23.531
He was made curator of it.

02:23.551 --> 02:26.176
He'd been a member of the Players for years.

02:26.196 --> 02:31.065
And, you know, in Edward Booth's home on Ramsey Park.

02:31.385 --> 02:34.891
And so it became part of this famous Walter Hampton Theatre Collection.

02:34.912 --> 02:39.119
And by whatever means necessary, Mulholland died in the 70s.

02:40.261 --> 02:40.802
How do you mean by that?

02:41.542 --> 02:45.507
I was going to say, by whatever means they were allowed to do this eventually.

02:45.607 --> 02:49.232
The sentence was, by whatever means necessary, Mulholland died in 1970.

02:49.252 --> 02:50.353
I said, what?

02:50.373 --> 02:52.576
This is the difference in speaking and writing.

02:52.596 --> 02:54.298
I mean, I'm clearly jumping all over.

02:54.318 --> 02:56.401
You're not paying attention to what you said.

02:56.421 --> 02:57.642
Well, there's your mistake.

02:57.842 --> 03:00.886
I don't pay attention to that.

03:01.887 --> 03:04.731
Mulholland died and by what means

03:05.251 --> 03:09.657
I'm not exactly sure the Players Club eventually decided that they were going to sell this collection.

03:09.677 --> 03:11.980
You know, I'm not claiming that they couldn't sell it.

03:12.621 --> 03:15.865
I am claiming, however, that Mulholland thought the collection was there for life.

03:16.146 --> 03:19.010
I will say that, because I have a tape recording where Mulholland says that.

03:19.030 --> 03:20.311
I'm addressing this in my book.

03:21.673 --> 03:22.955
Well, I don't know the answer.

03:23.015 --> 03:24.677
And like I say, I'm not pointing fingers.

03:24.697 --> 03:25.258
Well, I'll ask them.

03:25.278 --> 03:25.919
Because I don't know.

03:25.959 --> 03:26.640
Well, it's pretty simple.

03:26.680 --> 03:28.542
Yeah, go ask the Players Club and ask them.

03:28.563 --> 03:30.185
Yeah, that's an interesting question.

03:31.326 --> 03:34.110
So Mulholland certainly thought this was set for life there, but...

03:34.377 --> 03:44.913
By whatever means, they, you know, the players decided, they tried to sell it privately for quite a while, and they were unable to do that, and then eventually decided to put it up at auction at Swan.

03:47.457 --> 03:52.404
I had been called in by Swan as a consultant on the sale, and was helping them prepare it, because I knew the collection well.

03:52.424 --> 03:53.366
I mean, I've been there to do research.

03:53.386 --> 03:54.868
It must have really upset you to see this thing.

03:55.008 --> 03:55.409
Oh, sure.

03:55.529 --> 03:56.931
I mean, it was a great collection.

03:56.971 --> 04:01.177
I mean, there's certain collections that you don't mind seeing in BookerNet.

04:01.197 --> 04:02.199
I mean, if they're books.

04:02.339 --> 04:03.000
That's right.

04:03.149 --> 04:07.354
But this was one of the most famous magic collections in the world.

04:07.815 --> 04:12.802
Anyway, one day we got a call from an anonymous benefactor.

04:12.862 --> 04:13.803
Oh, it's a wonderful story.

04:13.883 --> 04:19.030
Who suddenly said, you know, he'd very much like to talk to someone about keeping his collection together.

04:19.070 --> 04:20.331
I was already living in L.A.

04:20.351 --> 04:21.253
I just went back to L.A.

04:21.273 --> 04:21.833
and talked to him.

04:22.394 --> 04:23.155
Anonymous?

04:23.175 --> 04:23.616
Yeah.

04:23.636 --> 04:24.817
Which is interesting, too.

04:25.859 --> 04:27.401
Anyway, we met five or six times.

04:27.521 --> 04:28.642
You met the anonymous benefactor?

04:28.662 --> 04:32.287
I met the anonymous benefactor, and eventually he decided that he would like to buy it.

04:32.307 --> 04:33.088
I mean, what happened is,

04:33.558 --> 04:35.923
He seemed very interested, but he didn't make any commitment.

04:35.983 --> 04:39.871
I called him up and I said, look, we're going to press in 48 hours on the first part of the cell.

04:39.891 --> 04:40.693
It was an enormous caution.

04:40.713 --> 04:42.456
We would have had to do it in at least three cells.

04:44.821 --> 04:46.324
So they did have a catalog printed?

04:47.126 --> 04:48.148
We were about ready.

04:48.188 --> 04:49.310
We never had a catalog printed.

04:49.351 --> 04:51.695
I mean, we were two days away from having it printed.

04:51.715 --> 04:52.637
We had slips.

04:52.838 --> 04:54.120
It would be a nice collectible.

04:54.140 --> 04:54.942
Yeah, we had slips.

04:55.613 --> 04:57.896
And we were just about ready to do that.

04:57.997 --> 04:59.759
And I called him up and I said, now is the time.

04:59.799 --> 05:02.423
We had had an offer from Europe and we didn't really want to do that.

05:02.443 --> 05:07.291
We didn't know what would happen to it in Europe, whether it would be broken up or kept together, it would be out of the country.

05:08.172 --> 05:10.696
And he decided that he would like to do it.

05:10.716 --> 05:11.678
We met one more time.

05:12.499 --> 05:15.904
And then he said he would do it if I would stay on and be curator.

05:15.984 --> 05:18.168
And I mean, this was like manna from heaven.

05:18.188 --> 05:19.910
I mean, I had never even considered it.

05:19.930 --> 05:21.773
I mean, it really was amazing.

05:22.006 --> 05:29.315
I wanted to make sure that my stipulation was that I could still continue to perform and write, and he said that was absolutely no problem for him at all.

05:29.335 --> 05:32.338
And so suddenly, you know, we got this collection.

05:32.719 --> 05:36.463
Does the benefactor continue to be anonymous?

05:37.584 --> 05:39.386
I mean, I don't read.

05:39.406 --> 05:42.410
You can't tell me who he is.

05:42.430 --> 05:43.431
Right.

05:44.392 --> 05:48.257
So the collection went out to L.A., and, you know, in the early days, I mean, I was there alone.

05:48.297 --> 05:51.861
I unpacked every book myself and put it up in this space, and then

05:52.448 --> 05:56.493
You know, and since then we've had, you know, to the point now where I have three people working for me.

05:56.513 --> 05:57.434
That's great.

05:57.454 --> 05:59.016
And, you know, and we're active and collecting.

05:59.036 --> 06:00.618
Well, now, who pays the three people?

06:01.539 --> 06:02.660
You?

06:02.681 --> 06:03.502
No.

06:03.622 --> 06:06.745
The benefactor.

06:06.786 --> 06:07.026
Well.

06:07.046 --> 06:07.967
You should tell everybody.

06:08.047 --> 06:11.151
You should ask the benefactor if they'd like to be identified on this.

06:11.171 --> 06:11.972
That's a nice story.

06:12.472 --> 06:13.354
Yeah, it is a nice story.

06:13.694 --> 06:15.376
But I'm, I'll ask him.

06:16.838 --> 06:18.119
I doubt it.

06:18.340 --> 06:20.262
I didn't matter to him that I went to L.A.

06:20.410 --> 06:22.613
He didn't insist that it stayed in New York.

06:23.414 --> 06:25.777
No, he wanted to go to Ellen.

06:25.997 --> 06:28.260
He wanted to go to Ellen.

06:28.280 --> 06:30.103
And it probably belongs in that way, actually.

06:30.403 --> 06:30.764
I don't know.

06:30.864 --> 06:32.206
I mean, that's very hard to know.

06:32.226 --> 06:34.789
I mean, one never knows the fate of such things, you know.

06:35.189 --> 06:38.093
But all I know is that the last five years have been fascinating.

06:38.193 --> 06:43.440
I mean, it came at a time in my life when this was a wonderful thing for me to be doing.

06:43.821 --> 06:46.564
This is a good story.

06:46.685 --> 06:47.886
I don't know as I've read it.

06:47.906 --> 06:50.029
Has this been published, the details?

06:50.414 --> 06:51.095
I don't think so.

06:51.496 --> 06:57.945
I mean, there was a press release that Swan sent out about a white knight coming in at the last minute and buying the collection.

06:57.985 --> 06:58.926
What happens to Swan?

06:58.946 --> 06:59.968
Do they still get a piece?

07:00.168 --> 07:02.171
Well, I'm sure they got a percentage to sell it.

07:02.191 --> 07:04.034
They were the sellers.

07:04.094 --> 07:05.396
They were the agents, right.

07:05.456 --> 07:07.098
They usually have 10% added.

07:07.619 --> 07:08.140
I don't know.

07:08.340 --> 07:12.506
Well, did the players play hardball on this?

07:13.768 --> 07:14.890
What do you mean by hardball?

07:15.470 --> 07:17.974
Well, they can sign the thing for options.

07:18.275 --> 07:20.317
Well, they obviously agreed, I mean, to do it.

07:20.377 --> 07:24.101
But, I mean, did they, whatever they were hoping to get, did they get what they were hoping to get?

07:24.201 --> 07:29.467
I don't know, again, I don't know the answer to that, because you have to look at my position then as opposed to my position now.

07:29.627 --> 07:33.371
I was brought in as a consultant for George, you know, for George Lowry.

07:34.011 --> 07:34.972
We got along fine.

07:36.334 --> 07:38.556
But I certainly didn't establish the price.

07:38.616 --> 07:39.457
Swan's graduate.

07:39.797 --> 07:41.339
Yeah, Swan brought me in, right.

07:41.359 --> 07:42.620
I didn't establish the price.

07:43.941 --> 07:44.502
I didn't.

07:44.650 --> 07:46.472
have anything to do with the sale.

07:46.512 --> 07:50.717
Well, I suppose I had a lot to do with the sale in the sense that I excited the benefactor about the collection.

07:51.117 --> 07:53.760
He, I'll tell you this, he was never a collector before.

07:54.261 --> 07:55.462
Well, this is what's great, right?

07:55.482 --> 07:56.663
Why didn't he buy it for himself?

07:57.044 --> 08:00.127
Well, he did buy it for himself, you know, in effect.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.489
Well, that's a good story.

08:01.509 --> 08:05.273
You know, he set up a library, right, where scholars can come and lose.

08:05.293 --> 08:07.696
This is one of the major thrusts of my book.

08:07.716 --> 08:09.317
I mean, it's done on every level.

08:09.438 --> 08:11.680
It is a genuinely philanthropic gesture.

08:11.700 --> 08:14.303
It's not this potent library over here.

08:14.941 --> 08:15.482
Sure.

08:15.542 --> 08:17.585
Yeah, no, it's very interesting.

08:17.605 --> 08:20.128
I mean, if I were you, I'd want to talk to him also.

08:20.168 --> 08:24.514
My guess is he won't talk to you, but it's just a guess.

08:25.075 --> 08:26.276
And again, I'm happy to ask him.

08:26.296 --> 08:26.937
You know what I mean?

08:26.957 --> 08:29.040
I'm not trying to... I'm going to write you and remind you.

08:30.081 --> 08:30.262
Sure.

08:30.322 --> 08:37.371
And maybe at some point after I've written a little bit, maybe I could send you a little copy to kind of show you where I'm coming from on the thing.

08:37.672 --> 08:39.134
Well, this is not for me.

08:39.154 --> 08:42.057
I mean, I will tell him that you'd like to talk to him.

08:42.317 --> 08:45.741
I mean, I'm just guessing based on my acquaintance with him.

08:45.781 --> 08:47.102
I love little coups like this.

08:47.122 --> 08:56.232
You know, Dick Manning is kind of shedding his... He's been the big anonymous collector for the last couple of years.

08:56.252 --> 09:01.758
He was the anonymous purchaser of Hope, and he was the anonymous purchaser of Shakespeare.

09:02.279 --> 09:03.660
Yeah, he was supposed to come up, apparently.

09:03.740 --> 09:05.302
We talked, yeah.

09:05.322 --> 09:06.463
In fact, we were going to get together.

09:06.612 --> 09:08.915
Yeah, it's too bad that it didn't come out.

09:08.935 --> 09:09.576
We haven't met yet.

09:09.596 --> 09:11.258
We've talked about six times.

09:11.698 --> 09:13.921
He called me one night at 10 o'clock at home.

09:14.702 --> 09:15.503
He said, it's good.

09:15.623 --> 09:16.324
I like it.

09:16.845 --> 09:18.187
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

09:18.607 --> 09:19.789
I took a shot.

09:19.949 --> 09:21.030
See if I can find your number.

09:21.631 --> 09:22.212
I said, no.

09:22.392 --> 09:23.814
I respect this.

09:23.854 --> 09:27.298
This is the kind of thing that I do, tracking people down.

09:27.679 --> 09:31.844
But he's going to be very good if I could.

09:31.864 --> 09:35.168
I've got a terrific story here at Cambridge, I think.

09:35.671 --> 09:40.238
What happens to Ricky Jay's collection?

09:40.298 --> 09:41.240
My personal thought.

09:41.260 --> 09:41.360
Yeah.

09:42.662 --> 09:44.284
Well, I don't know.

09:44.304 --> 09:49.012
I mean, you're a young guy, but let me phrase it another way.

09:49.452 --> 09:51.756
How do you feel about collections going?

09:52.428 --> 09:58.878
collected items going back out into the marketplace for the next generation of collectors, or should they go to an institution like them?

09:59.319 --> 10:01.642
Well, again, I mean, here's obviously a difference.

10:01.662 --> 10:15.804
I mean, as a private collector, I mean, I suppose I'd say it should go in the marketplace privately, but as someone who represents the institution, I mean, I think it's probably most likely it would join that collection.

10:15.864 --> 10:19.870
You are in a unique situation where you

10:20.339 --> 10:26.464
represent the collection, the formal collection, and your private collection.

10:26.484 --> 10:33.150
Right, and we've worked out guidelines, the benefactor and I have worked out guidelines, so there's not a conflict with that.

10:33.270 --> 10:35.212
And that's something that I think has to be discussed.

10:35.252 --> 10:42.438
I think we've all heard stories of serious conflicts when things like that weren't dealt with.

10:42.458 --> 10:46.742
Is the benefactor, does the benefactor consider himself a collector now?

10:46.762 --> 10:49.384
Well, I think now he certainly does.

10:49.617 --> 10:52.861
a major collection in this field, for sure.

10:53.521 --> 10:56.004
Is it his collection, per se?

10:56.565 --> 11:07.837
Well, it's fairly clear that he doesn't like to talk about it and doesn't choose to have anything mentioned with it, so I can't really go beyond that.

11:07.857 --> 11:16.587
I mean, I can talk about the collection, and I have, on that level, fairly autonomous dealings with it.

11:16.820 --> 11:18.401
I deal with the collection.

11:18.441 --> 11:21.825
I don't have anything to do with the business of the collection at all.

11:21.845 --> 11:22.765
So that's handled.

11:23.666 --> 11:25.548
That's handled.

11:25.568 --> 11:27.890
The business of the collection is handled by other people.

11:30.092 --> 11:35.497
Like I said, I have nothing to do with the business of the... Do I sound like a naive questioner?

11:36.358 --> 11:40.001
The point is you don't, yeah.

11:40.181 --> 11:44.125
But you clearly are intrigued by all of this business and machinations.

11:44.145 --> 11:44.986
And I'm not.

11:45.286 --> 11:46.287
I'm intrigued by books.

11:46.722 --> 11:49.465
And I mean, honestly, I'm really not.

11:49.666 --> 11:52.870
I mean, and maybe it's my own fault.

11:52.990 --> 11:57.215
You know, I mean, I don't know that I'm particularly sophisticated about business on any level.

11:57.315 --> 12:04.765
I just... I love books, and I also believe in the worth of what we're doing.

12:04.825 --> 12:15.919
I mean, you know, in establishing a research institution and hopefully going to the next step, which is having our own museum and with a small theater to keep these arts alive by the performance of the best people in the field and...

12:16.372 --> 12:19.576
And this conference that we just put on, I'm incredibly excited about.

12:19.596 --> 12:21.058
Did I send you the catalog of the conference?

12:21.078 --> 12:21.138
No.

12:21.158 --> 12:21.759
Would you do that?

12:22.039 --> 12:24.582
Yeah, I actually have one in town here.

12:24.602 --> 12:26.084
You need a lift someplace?

12:26.104 --> 12:28.147
Yeah, you could drop me off at this house.

12:28.167 --> 12:29.869
Okay.

12:29.889 --> 12:30.009
Great.

12:30.029 --> 12:32.672
So you can see, you know, on that level what we're doing.

12:32.712 --> 12:33.393
I mean, you know.

12:34.595 --> 12:39.181
Do you want to wrap it up now?

12:39.381 --> 12:41.303
Whatever you want.

12:41.383 --> 12:42.284
I'm fine for five.

12:42.585 --> 12:43.145
Good.

12:43.165 --> 12:44.387
I think there's anything else.

12:45.110 --> 12:48.694
I mean, I think you'll probably find out there is later after you digest this.

12:48.734 --> 12:53.538
I mean, we've been going around so much of a complete picture of it.

12:53.558 --> 13:04.650
Have you heard, I understand that I've heard that... I mean, the choice I made about my book was not to try to do a chronological history.

13:04.850 --> 13:05.851
Which I'm not doing either.

13:05.871 --> 13:07.392
Right, which you're not doing either, right.

13:07.492 --> 13:08.854
And now there probably is some variety there.

13:09.294 --> 13:15.100
But rather, the things that interested me and telling stories that for the most part had not been told before.

13:15.569 --> 13:22.059
And if you really want to get technical about it, you know, they were told only in the remarkable character literature.

13:22.079 --> 13:27.707
I mean, that's another field that I passionately collect, you know, stories of remarkable characters.

13:27.727 --> 13:31.112
And these compilations first begin in the end of the 18th century.

13:31.813 --> 13:45.373
They were actually first done, you know, in Granger's History of England, you know, the whole term of Grangerizing, of illustrating these pieces, and the last class that he talked about where, you know, this wonderful class of entertainers and beggars and con ministers, and that's

13:45.708 --> 13:47.470
That's the thing that I'm particularly fascinated by.

13:48.031 --> 13:54.237
But I went back, you know, in many cases, to sources prior to that to try to find out the real stories.

13:54.337 --> 13:56.240
And yeah, they are wonderful stories.

13:56.280 --> 14:00.684
I mean, ultimately, I'm absolutely excited about this field.

14:00.704 --> 14:03.988
I mean, I find the stuff wonderful.

14:04.008 --> 14:09.434
And beyond the pure romance of a story like Hobson's, I find the insanity of stories.

14:09.494 --> 14:14.820
Like one of the pieces I'm working on is a piece that I might call Houdini colon

14:15.087 --> 14:20.094
Howdini, Audini, Martini, Zini, and Zucchini for tenders to the throat.

14:20.615 --> 14:40.343
I'm compiling material on imitators of Houdini, and it's inspired largely by a poster I have framed in my house of a Hungarian escape artist named Martini Zini in a Mexican outfit strapped and chained to a cactus plant, printed by a German lithographer, you know, with the pastels of the plains and Indians behind.

14:40.383 --> 14:41.285
I mean, I love this.

14:41.405 --> 14:42.847
It's just crazy.

14:42.867 --> 14:44.850
I love it.

14:44.870 --> 14:45.010
This is

14:45.412 --> 14:47.254
one of the best little stories you've published.

14:47.274 --> 14:49.176
Yeah, but I mean, I do, and I mean... Who are you writing this for?

14:49.196 --> 14:50.378
Is this a book or an article?

14:50.398 --> 14:52.260
It may wind up being part of another book.

14:52.300 --> 15:00.108
I mean, I just gave a paper on Aztec Lilliputians and the Wizard of the North, the last paper that I gave at my own conference.

15:00.168 --> 15:15.165
There was a book published in 1850 about the travels of a man who found this supposedly the only heirs to an ancient Aztec race of sacrodotal intermarried priests.

15:15.652 --> 15:18.035
who had sloped heads and were tiny.

15:18.696 --> 15:21.600
And this becomes a great story.

15:21.620 --> 15:24.144
So I bought, many years ago, I bought one of these pamphlets.

15:24.164 --> 15:28.470
There have been a number printed since the first of 1850, which I have, and I have a few later editions.

15:29.311 --> 15:33.797
And I found out, well, this may be an interesting story for your book.

15:34.679 --> 15:35.320
By the way, it is.

15:35.920 --> 15:44.933
Well, I'm saying how I wound up pursuing this and writing 50 pages about it, or whatever I've done, comes very specifically from

15:45.520 --> 15:47.802
what I think is the best part of collecting.

15:48.983 --> 15:58.431
So forget, years ago, I get this book, and I read it, and it's clearly a hoax, and wonderfully written, and charming.

15:58.451 --> 16:03.916
But that's all I know about it at that point, that I'm very happy I've bought this pamphlet, but I don't really know much more about it.

16:04.056 --> 16:11.342
And I'm also intrigued by the fact that you just sense from reading this thing that it's so preposterous that this can't be real.

16:11.363 --> 16:13.024
I mean, it just doesn't sound real.

16:13.044 --> 16:14.245
They're comparing

16:14.495 --> 16:30.475
the Aztecs, the figures carved in Mayan statuary, and they're comparing it to the great Austin Laird's work on Nineveh, and, you know, Stevens' history of Central America has just come out, and these kind of fascinating sociological points to make the world ripe for this story.

16:30.955 --> 16:36.482
And I'm very interested in the history of the presentation of freaks and anomalies of all kinds, and so I'm intrigued.

16:36.502 --> 16:39.606
But that's 10 years ago, 15 years ago, whenever I bought this pamphlet.

16:39.626 --> 16:40.587
It's at least 10 years ago.

16:41.849 --> 16:49.997
Cut to, I'm in the home of a bookseller in Germany, and he shows me a collection of freak material.

16:50.017 --> 16:53.160
Let's say this is between three and five years ago.

16:53.220 --> 16:57.084
Remember, I'm terrible at chronology, but we have basic times.

16:58.045 --> 17:02.549
And he shows me a collection of freak material that's very expensive, like $30,000 or something.

17:02.610 --> 17:09.156
And in it, there are only two pieces that are vaguely interesting, but in fact, one of them is really interesting, and it's a piece of a man

17:10.132 --> 17:16.301
holding two tiny people, and the caption is, the Aztec relocation.

17:16.962 --> 17:19.987
I say to him, can I buy this?

17:20.087 --> 17:22.851
And he says, you can only buy the whole collection.

17:22.871 --> 17:25.775
And I say, will you copy it for me?

17:25.795 --> 17:27.077
Make me a photocopy of this.

17:27.197 --> 17:28.439
And I take another piece, too.

17:28.860 --> 17:33.607
And that's funny, and extra, you know, as a collector, you don't want your exact passion.

17:33.887 --> 17:36.992
So I have another piece, which I'm not particularly interested in, and I haven't copied that.

17:37.532 --> 17:39.295
The reason I'm intrigued by this

17:39.629 --> 17:46.076
is that I think the man holding the Aztec Lilliputians is the most famous 19th century British magician.

17:47.878 --> 17:51.462
I'm looking at it, and it looks to me like it's John Henry Anderson.

17:51.482 --> 17:52.023
But I don't know.

17:52.964 --> 17:54.245
It's just so weird.

17:54.986 --> 17:58.670
You know, I've never heard of any reference with John Henry Anderson in the Aztec Lilliputians.

17:58.730 --> 18:00.732
I don't want to pay $30,000.

18:00.792 --> 18:03.776
I mean, the rest of it is interesting, but not irrelevant.

18:03.936 --> 18:05.097
Irrelevant, basically.

18:06.123 --> 18:10.247
But it's interesting about how you work on a piece and how your collection becomes part of your life.

18:10.488 --> 18:18.276
So I get a photocopy of this, and I take it home, and sure enough, I have pictures of Anderson, you know, these 18th century cabinets, and I take it, and it's Anderson.

18:18.356 --> 18:20.579
It's absolutely Anderson.

18:20.599 --> 18:26.345
So now I start hunting magic journals for some reference to Anderson and the Aztecs, and I find none.

18:26.445 --> 18:33.352
I find absolutely no reference to Anderson and the Aztecs, and that's kind of frustrating.

18:33.372 --> 18:35.775
So again, I think, all right, interesting.

18:36.430 --> 18:37.311
Nothing goes by.

18:37.351 --> 18:39.433
A year later, I come across some reference.

18:39.493 --> 18:43.818
The first time I ever see Anderson's name linked with the Aztecs, and I think, boy, this is neat.

18:43.838 --> 18:48.283
Again, nothing much happens, but it's all kind of coming together in my mind.

18:48.323 --> 18:54.129
Years later, three or four years later, the dealer turns up in America.

18:54.730 --> 18:55.190
Same guy.

18:55.451 --> 18:55.991
Same guy.

18:57.253 --> 19:01.717
And we've had some strained relationships since then.

19:01.737 --> 19:04.681
And he's offering material for sale in this area.

19:04.801 --> 19:05.121
And they're...

19:05.405 --> 19:12.073
The thing that's interesting about this is he's offering it for sale at a convention of magicians, collectors of magic material.

19:13.515 --> 19:16.279
And he's actually got that piece.

19:16.539 --> 19:18.421
In parts, different pieces.

19:19.703 --> 19:23.187
And he doesn't invite me to see this stuff right away like he usually does.

19:23.207 --> 19:26.892
So I'm one of the last people to go up there to see his stock.

19:27.012 --> 19:28.854
And there's this piece, the Aztec Lilliputian.

19:30.456 --> 19:33.821
And now many magicians have looked at this and have no idea.

19:33.881 --> 19:34.922
They haven't made the connection.

19:35.442 --> 19:40.189
I mean, again, I'm not saying this to prove that I'm, you know, it's what happened.

19:40.229 --> 19:44.214
And I see the piece, and I say to him, and the other piece that I'd asked him to Xerox is there.

19:44.495 --> 19:49.101
The only two pieces that are Xeroxed, that I've Xeroxed, are the only, and I say, well, what happened here?

19:49.121 --> 19:51.725
And he said, well, I was able to buy these two pieces.

19:51.745 --> 19:55.109
And the piece, the price on this Aztec piece is very, very reasonable.

19:55.190 --> 19:58.935
And obviously, if anybody had realized it was Anderson, it would have been much more.

19:59.796 --> 20:03.441
So I get it like that, and then I work in earnest.

20:03.910 --> 20:05.052
on this piece.

20:05.072 --> 20:06.253
I mean, really nervous.

20:06.554 --> 20:08.256
All these years have passed, he hasn't sold it.

20:09.097 --> 20:09.738
He didn't own it.

20:09.758 --> 20:10.539
He had to buy it.

20:10.600 --> 20:11.681
It was on consignment.

20:11.741 --> 20:12.763
It was on consignment.

20:13.043 --> 20:16.768
And he wound up only buying those two pieces, clearly thinking he could then sell them to me.

20:16.788 --> 20:17.209
But you did.

20:17.489 --> 20:17.830
Okay.

20:17.990 --> 20:18.791
Only one of the two.

20:18.811 --> 20:21.755
The other one, I remember I was really never interested in the other piece.

20:21.796 --> 20:22.016
Right.

20:22.276 --> 20:22.717
Exactly.

20:22.757 --> 20:23.919
It was a deep part piece.

20:23.999 --> 20:24.940
I don't know if you want

20:25.493 --> 20:27.438
I know that stuff makes good copy for a book.

20:27.458 --> 20:29.984
It's just a little weird when you talk about how you buy.

20:30.104 --> 20:31.949
Is there a payoff to the story?

20:31.969 --> 20:34.896
Have you finally been able to fix Anderson?

20:35.738 --> 20:40.650
The payoff to the story is I've located three other pieces with Anderson and the Aztecs.

20:40.883 --> 20:42.806
I've now put the whole story together.

20:42.846 --> 20:45.470
There's absolutely no question that he exhibited them.

20:45.550 --> 20:51.398
I found material, and I've written, you know, a 40-page paper about, you know, Anderson and the Aztec.

20:52.119 --> 20:57.407
I just gave it in this conference, and it'll be part of a book or published, you know, whatever.

20:57.447 --> 21:00.732
I might want a little detail on it.

21:03.496 --> 21:04.076
Sure.

21:04.417 --> 21:06.520
So, I mean, again, it's a real collective.

21:06.820 --> 21:14.108
You've just given me two stories that I'm not knowing what they were, but I came to get.

21:14.229 --> 21:18.934
Well, I suppose what you're saying is you're interested in really anecdotal sort of stuff.

21:18.994 --> 21:22.518
And the thing is that, you know, it's also part of why you rationalize.

21:22.538 --> 21:30.347
Remember what I said earlier about how every collector rationalizes why he should have a piece in someone, you know, rather than the next person who also wants to buy the same piece.

21:30.715 --> 21:36.564
And to me, this is what justifies my business in it, that I will go to these extremes in business.

21:36.584 --> 21:37.245
That's a great story.

21:37.405 --> 21:38.747
That's a great story.

21:38.827 --> 21:40.329
Just give me the years for Anderson again.

21:41.291 --> 21:43.935
He was, I think, 19th century.

21:43.955 --> 21:44.916
Yeah.

21:46.218 --> 21:47.761
Just give me his full name, and I'll check him out.

21:47.781 --> 21:51.707
Oh, I mean, it's just insane to me that I can't remember this off the top of my mind.

21:51.727 --> 21:57.876
He was born in the first decade of the 19th century, and died, you know, in the 70s.

21:57.896 --> 21:59.338
So he has some lost years, then.

21:59.960 --> 22:00.861
Well, it's very interesting.

22:00.941 --> 22:04.546
To this day, it's one of the points that I mention in this article.

22:04.566 --> 22:06.468
There are a number of things that are very interesting about it.

22:06.708 --> 22:11.254
One is that no magic report ever mentions this, ever.

22:11.274 --> 22:12.015
It's like the last year.

22:12.035 --> 22:12.836
He came to America.

22:12.896 --> 22:13.977
He made two tours of America.

22:13.997 --> 22:15.239
You'll see there's a lot of material in him.

22:15.259 --> 22:16.060
Just look at the catalog.

22:16.100 --> 22:17.602
His dates will be in the catalog yesterday.

22:17.622 --> 22:20.065
It's very weird that I'm buying it.

22:20.085 --> 22:21.847
No problem.

22:21.867 --> 22:27.074
Because I even went to a great deal of trouble to find his actual birth date, which is recorded in at least four different places.

22:27.234 --> 22:27.334
Okay.

22:27.685 --> 22:30.810
Maybe that's why I'm reluctant to commit to it.

22:31.651 --> 22:33.073
You always get the wrong date for him.

22:34.696 --> 22:36.618
Just like Marcus had the wrong date for me.

22:36.679 --> 22:38.301
I don't think he did yesterday.

22:38.321 --> 22:47.515
But I found three other bills that have him with the Aztecs and every time he is unidentified.

22:48.536 --> 22:51.140
I think it makes perfect sense that he was a promoter.

22:51.981 --> 22:55.667
He was the most bombastic magician of his day, the biggest advertiser of his day.

22:55.917 --> 22:59.904
For instance, you know, there are more pictures of him in that catalog than anyone else.

23:00.425 --> 23:02.128
He was over in America two different times.

23:02.168 --> 23:05.314
The first time he came here was exactly the same time that they were on tour.

23:05.354 --> 23:07.518
They played the same venues, not at the same time.

23:07.558 --> 23:08.319
They clearly met.

23:08.740 --> 23:09.742
He brought them to England.

23:10.022 --> 23:14.550
The thing that I do find fascinating is that he took them to see Queen Victoria, and yet...

23:14.767 --> 23:19.233
he's not letting himself be identified with them on the program.

23:19.273 --> 23:27.584
So there's a side of him that clearly is worried that this is beneath him as a performer, and yet here's a guy who will take publicity at any cost.

23:27.604 --> 23:29.947
So it's not entirely solved, this mystery.

23:30.267 --> 23:40.521
And then I go into the mystery of the Aztecs themselves and anthropological hoaxes, and I end the paper by tying it into Castaneda and the Don Juan books, because I think there really is a similarity, that there's

23:40.957 --> 23:49.087
an absolutely fraudulent anthropological hoax going on.

23:49.307 --> 23:54.413
So you're a scholar, and you consider yourself a scholar.

23:54.433 --> 23:59.959
Well, I don't, I mean, I'm very, let's say I'm very serious about this work that I do.

24:00.220 --> 24:04.024
I mean, but you mentioned that you no longer do nightclub shows.

24:04.104 --> 24:04.605
Right.

24:04.625 --> 24:09.951
I think this is clearly connected with the course that your career has taken.

24:10.640 --> 24:12.823
You have elevated, you have elevated.

24:12.843 --> 24:13.945
I don't know that it's elevated.

24:14.265 --> 24:15.587
I've changed all my life.

24:15.627 --> 24:23.118
I mean, there were 10 years where I refused to work on stage because I thought it created a barrier between a magician and an audience and I would only work in a close-up situation.

24:23.979 --> 24:28.646
I would work in short-sleeved shirts and, you know, I mean, I've gone through many phases in my life.

24:28.726 --> 24:32.952
I look at this as constantly evolving and at the moment I am passionately interested in

24:33.269 --> 24:39.179
the history of my art and lecturing about the literature and the art, and, you know, I may be doing something very different.

24:39.199 --> 24:41.042
I may want to be in nightclubs again in years.

24:41.062 --> 24:43.547
And you're a young guy, 42, I guess, is the age.

24:44.027 --> 24:44.208
One.

24:44.348 --> 24:44.488
41.

24:45.931 --> 24:51.080
So, I mean, you haven't even reached the halfway point of your career, not even.

24:51.120 --> 24:51.981
We don't know that either.

24:52.262 --> 24:53.083
Probably hope.

24:53.232 --> 24:57.059
This could be the last day I ever do anything.

24:57.199 --> 24:57.940
So where do we go?

24:57.980 --> 25:01.246
It's clearly a development.

25:01.306 --> 25:04.411
What excites me is that I'm doing different things all the time.

25:04.491 --> 25:10.421
It excites me that at the age of 39 or 40 I suddenly was acting in some wonderful movies.

25:10.441 --> 25:11.443
It excites me that

25:11.862 --> 25:19.933
This year I've done my own television special, and it excites me that, you know, I had a book on this esoterica theme so well accepted.

25:19.953 --> 25:21.195
That's a bestseller, isn't it?

25:21.215 --> 25:22.677
Yeah, a mild bestseller.

25:22.797 --> 25:25.040
Front page of New York Times, all of these things.

25:25.060 --> 25:26.822
What were the numbers on that offhand?

25:26.842 --> 25:28.464
I don't know.

25:28.484 --> 25:29.165
I'm curious.

25:29.265 --> 25:36.055
Well, there were three printings of the hardcover, although, I mean, that's the great crime of the book, is that there weren't enough hardcover copies out when it was really hot.

25:36.075 --> 25:37.557
It was sold in three, four weeks.

25:37.697 --> 25:38.578
It was on...

25:38.963 --> 25:46.075
The front page of the New York Times with this rave two weeks before Christmas, and they didn't have another copy of the book until the first day of February.

25:46.095 --> 25:47.617
You could have sold 100,000.

25:47.697 --> 25:48.559
I was killed.

25:48.579 --> 25:50.302
I mean, I was flat out destroyed.

25:50.482 --> 25:51.884
It's a terrible story.

25:51.924 --> 25:55.891
I've got the same house, too, and random house, which is the same.

25:55.911 --> 25:57.293
They're good, I mean.

25:57.374 --> 26:05.224
Well, you know, people, it's very interesting, booksellers always have said to me about that book, every year it happens to one or two books.

26:06.466 --> 26:09.250
But there they went behind it and got back and did it.

26:09.270 --> 26:09.590
The next year.

26:09.610 --> 26:09.931
In my case.

26:09.971 --> 26:11.373
They came right back the next year.

26:11.393 --> 26:13.936
That's what they should have done with your book.

26:14.036 --> 26:18.662
It didn't happen, and my relationship with Billard, with that branch of ranch, was just really strange.

26:19.083 --> 26:21.566
That's part of what happened, is that he left in the middle of it.

26:21.586 --> 26:26.132
He was a champion of the book, and he left, and my editor became the acting head, and it,

26:26.365 --> 26:28.508
I'll tell you a cute Mark Jaffe story if you're right.

26:28.588 --> 26:32.454
I'll shoot it up the machine.

26:32.474 --> 26:33.055
By booksellers.

26:33.876 --> 26:36.440
By books in general, beyond my field.

26:36.540 --> 26:38.563
And I like the company of booksellers.

26:38.583 --> 26:39.785
They're usually interesting people.

26:39.865 --> 26:44.332
But it is a field that seems, you know, just utterly rampant with gossip.

26:44.352 --> 26:48.518
I'm having no trouble getting this story.

26:48.578 --> 26:51.462
That's why I really wonder if I have to go to court and get this.

26:51.847 --> 26:57.953
Because I'm, as you can see, I'm getting what's available outside of the case.

26:57.973 --> 27:01.457
I really am having a terrific, terrific story.

27:01.797 --> 27:03.119
People are talking to me.

27:03.139 --> 27:04.780
My sources are good.

27:04.800 --> 27:06.702
Yeah, well, there are fascinating stories.

27:06.722 --> 27:09.826
And I think the glass is as good as what's in the file.

27:09.846 --> 27:18.194
Well, except that, I mean, I can tell you, you know, from my own thing, from the library, when we bought this library, all sorts of stories came out that were just ridiculous.

27:18.274 --> 27:19.596
I mean, they were just wrong.

27:19.656 --> 27:20.757
And people would call me,

27:20.956 --> 27:23.559
And I would never tell anyone something that was untrue.

27:23.619 --> 27:27.284
You know, I would tell them in my limited capacity what I could.

27:27.324 --> 27:30.628
And people would simply ignore it.

27:30.648 --> 27:31.730
It was the oddest thing.

27:31.850 --> 27:34.513
I mean, I just think people's sense of God.

27:34.694 --> 27:35.815
They'd make up prices.

27:36.316 --> 27:38.639
They'd make up who this person was, you know.

27:38.679 --> 27:41.342
I mean, you know, his profession, where he lived.

27:41.382 --> 27:42.864
Never write for any of it.

27:42.964 --> 27:43.325
Never, never.

27:43.505 --> 27:44.947
I'll give you an example of the same thing.

27:45.027 --> 27:50.794
Howard Gottlieb, you know, Howard, he runs Boston University's candidate in competition for Texas, but he doesn't have that money.

27:51.432 --> 27:55.517
And I wrote a story on how—actually, this was the story that led to my selling book.

27:55.557 --> 27:58.501
I should send you a copy of my shirt.

27:58.521 --> 28:06.151
It was a nice little anecdotal story, but Howard said he was grueling, glorious once, and that's what I wanted a collection from Boston University.

28:06.171 --> 28:11.298
He said, I was eating a macrobiotic food still was coming out of my ears, and he was sending him flowers.

28:11.618 --> 28:15.583
And he said, and then I woke up one morning, and I heard on the radio, I heard on the radio,

28:15.952 --> 28:20.200
that had gone to the University of Texas, and they did something that I couldn't do.

28:20.220 --> 28:22.766
They gave her a million dollars.

28:22.786 --> 28:23.687
And so I wrote that.

28:23.768 --> 28:27.535
And then when I was kind of contacting the people of Texas, I sent them from the store.

28:27.615 --> 28:32.104
And the last thing I was there for three days, two people told me, by the way,

28:32.692 --> 28:34.897
That million dollars is bullshit.

28:35.458 --> 28:37.081
You can only pay a hundred thousand dollars.

28:37.342 --> 28:40.388
You tell Howard Brotley that we didn't pay.

28:40.549 --> 28:43.295
We did not pay a million dollars for Gloria Swanson.

28:43.315 --> 28:46.582
She wanted to come to Texas, and she didn't want to go to Boston.

28:46.602 --> 28:48.726
And she really did not want to go to L.A.

28:49.528 --> 28:52.354
And in those circumstances that she wanted to go to UCLA,

28:52.790 --> 28:55.155
Because she thought she got screwed on the last one.

28:55.776 --> 28:57.759
But she didn't, so she wanted to go outside.

28:57.780 --> 29:00.344
I mean, now I can pretty much put this story down.

29:01.146 --> 29:04.152
But how does it make you feel to have put in something that was a rumor?

29:04.192 --> 29:07.438
I mean, do you feel good because it's a good story or bad that it isn't right?

29:07.678 --> 29:09.602
Well, it wasn't in my book, number one.

29:09.722 --> 29:12.007
But number two, the guy... Well, but it was in the article, I think.

29:12.027 --> 29:14.832
Yeah, but I quoted the guy directly on the record.

29:15.031 --> 29:16.553
Oh, that's interesting.

29:16.573 --> 29:19.656
That's already very different than what I'm saying to you.

29:19.676 --> 29:21.978
I read the quotes in them on the phone.

29:22.018 --> 29:30.226
In fact, what it did do... What's strange to me is that I know anything about their worlds, you know, I mean, because that kind of collecting really is different.

29:30.246 --> 29:37.093
I mean, there's this collecting that comes from passion and from the field, you know, and that's clearly what I do.

29:37.113 --> 29:38.735
And once again, I'm not saying it's better.

29:38.795 --> 29:40.316
Well, I guess I am saying it's better.

29:40.396 --> 29:45.021
I guess in my heart I believe that, so there's no sense to mince words about that.

29:45.625 --> 29:53.914
I think that is better than simply going out to buy the best book in the field and high spot without, you know, some depth or some intuition.

29:53.934 --> 29:56.858
On the other hand, you know, people change.

29:56.898 --> 30:04.987
We talked a minute ago about the evolutionary process, and if that's the way you get into the subject that you then become impassioned about and then become an expert about, great.

30:05.387 --> 30:06.328
I mean, that's fine too.

30:06.969 --> 30:12.595
I don't know that I even believe everybody's got to be an expert, but I think, I mean, it can't happen.

30:13.486 --> 30:16.450
Did I mention I'm doing this guy, Forsheimer, down in Washington?

30:16.470 --> 30:18.332
Do you know who he is?

30:18.352 --> 30:19.033
Sure.

30:19.053 --> 30:20.095
The CIA collection.

30:20.115 --> 30:21.957
I think he's going to be one of my guys.

30:22.918 --> 30:23.179
He is?

30:23.379 --> 30:24.240
Yeah.

30:24.581 --> 30:25.782
Fascinating.

30:25.822 --> 30:27.084
His collection is unique.

30:27.184 --> 30:29.928
And it's better than anything they've got at Langley.

30:30.408 --> 30:30.709
Really?

30:31.550 --> 30:32.211
Do you know who he is?

30:32.251 --> 30:33.412
This is Forsheimer's nephew.

30:33.973 --> 30:34.894
Oh, oh, oh.

30:34.954 --> 30:37.277
This is not the great Forsheimer.

30:37.478 --> 30:40.101
No, that's who I thought you were talking about.

30:40.121 --> 30:42.244
This guy, he's alive.

30:42.427 --> 30:44.249
was a charter member of the CIA.

30:44.750 --> 30:53.060
He came out of the OSS, and then he has put together these people out of suite at the Watergate just to house his CIA collection.

30:53.080 --> 30:56.304
Well, it's not just CIA, it's like what you've done with magic.

30:56.324 --> 31:02.331
I mean, it's espionage going back 400 years, anything that... No, I don't know.

31:02.351 --> 31:05.735
It's a great... But he's the nephew of... He's the nephew.

31:05.775 --> 31:06.516
That's right.

31:06.596 --> 31:07.978
He's the youngest member.

31:08.058 --> 31:09.700
I left it at a 12-year club.

31:10.338 --> 31:11.681
eccentric.

31:11.701 --> 31:13.204
Should be just a thoroughly delightful.

31:14.446 --> 31:15.087
Can I buy you a drink?

31:15.929 --> 31:20.177
You were offered what?

31:20.197 --> 31:20.758
Let's do it again.

31:20.778 --> 31:27.952
Well, there's one particular day that I was offered a dean, whole art of ledger domain, not the first of 1722, but an 18th century dean.

31:28.232 --> 31:29.595
I had no copies of that.

31:29.930 --> 31:35.078
And that's, you know, a book that any magic person would consider a great high spot book.

31:35.118 --> 31:44.874
You know, any book with Hocus Pocus in the title is considered really important, but I was also offered on the same day Pinchbeck's Expositor, which is the first original American magic book.

31:44.914 --> 31:49.862
It's an 1805 imprint, 19th century, not 18th century, but it's a book that had never been reprinted.

31:50.399 --> 32:20.406
um they were about the same price i mean to me there was no question about the choice but what were the prices oh god this is a while ago i i think i paid i think i wound up paying you know between four and five hundred dollars for the exposure you should have got a boat you know well i couldn't afford to i flat out couldn't afford to that was the whole point i mean that was an awful lot of money for me to be paying on a book but you couldn't take them both and pay the guy i mean we do that all the time well that's what i was saying i was already i was already in debt i was up to i mean no that was a great deal of money for me then i'm sure it was the first time i'd ever paid that much for a book and it

32:21.213 --> 32:46.360
it just was a much more important book to read it wasn't a rehash it wasn't the same material it was a new approach it was a new country i mean uh another time i was offered a really important book at the same time i was offered uh the andrew roller book that i talked about in my lecture you know life travels and unparalleled sufferings of andrew i mean i'm trying to find books within this world that are also fun to read that are wonderful books to talk about i mean that give you great anecdotal material

32:46.745 --> 32:52.196
you know, rather than simply some famous book or some book that's made important because someone else tells you it's important.

32:52.416 --> 32:54.680
I mean, that's what comes from reading.

32:54.740 --> 32:58.929
Well, let me ask you, so you clearly brought the book there that was the important one, did you?

32:58.969 --> 33:04.439
To me, yeah, but I'm saying that I think other people making that choice would not necessarily have brought that book.

33:04.459 --> 33:09.529
But would you also say that was a lost opportunity on the one you passed, or have you since been offered that book again?

33:09.745 --> 33:10.526
Well, it's interesting.

33:10.606 --> 33:15.995
I have, and I've bought a number of copies of it from the library, but ironically, I don't own an 18th century dean myself.

33:16.776 --> 33:23.486
You know, even though the first Philadelphia dean, 1795, is a great rarity, and as I mentioned in that story, I really wanted that.

33:23.546 --> 33:28.394
It was only by the weirdest stretch of luck that the third known copy of that didn't go to me.

33:28.414 --> 33:31.699
I mean, it literally was the bookseller calling an R.J.

33:32.801 --> 33:35.745
for information in Los Angeles and getting someone else's number.

33:35.785 --> 33:36.446
That wasn't mine.

33:36.466 --> 33:37.508
I'm an unlisted number.

33:37.927 --> 33:58.197
and uh you know missing it out that way one other thing though uh you did mention your mentor how did you connect with him which which is that the 95 year old fellow oh vernon yeah well my grandfather um you know who mark mentioned this was a well-known amateur magician and and please i haven't asked you which your actual given surname is

33:58.598 --> 34:01.264
I suppose I'm mildly pleased.

34:03.089 --> 34:07.078
But anyway, my grandfather and this man, Vernon, were great friends.

34:07.218 --> 34:08.942
And so I met him as a kid.

34:09.023 --> 34:12.591
And then I moved to Los Angeles, really, because he was there.

34:13.010 --> 34:17.116
So this was really a pilgrimage, so to speak.

34:17.276 --> 34:18.437
Yeah, I mean, it was.

34:18.578 --> 34:25.387
I came out to do some shows, and I realized he hadn't been situated in L.A., and I was going back and forth, and I just wanted to spend time with him.

34:25.407 --> 34:29.713
So this really was a case of passing on, of taking an apprentice.

34:29.733 --> 34:37.363
Yeah, in Los Angeles, Vernon and a man named Charlie Miller, who I just dedicated this conference to, who just died this year at the age of 70, who was brilliant.

34:37.698 --> 34:40.401
And those were the two great sleight-of-hand men.

34:40.421 --> 34:42.744
So you just didn't emerge into this world.

34:42.804 --> 34:45.728
I mean, you were brought into it.

34:45.748 --> 34:46.369
Can we say that?

34:46.629 --> 34:48.091
Sure.

34:49.373 --> 34:53.498
But, you know, my grandfather taught all the other grandchildren, too, and none of them ever pursued it.

34:53.518 --> 34:54.399
You know what I mean?

34:55.300 --> 34:56.882
Well, everything doesn't take, you know?

34:57.003 --> 34:57.403
Right.

34:57.683 --> 34:58.545
Everything doesn't take.

34:58.625 --> 34:59.986

35:00.127 --> 35:02.770

35:03.891 --> 35:06.034
Well, that's good.

35:07.145 --> 35:11.434
We're gonna run I think you get it
