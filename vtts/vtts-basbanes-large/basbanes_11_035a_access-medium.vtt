WEBVTT

00:02.562 --> 00:03.663
to tell you what I'm doing.

00:03.884 --> 00:09.270
And if you could, just for the purposes of this tape, tell us who you are and what you do here with Corvus.

00:09.830 --> 00:11.472
My name is Charles Mossey.

00:11.492 --> 00:32.316
I'm the director of media development at Corvus, and my central responsibility is in the guiding and building of the development of the Corvus archive, which I sort of lovingly have called the Digital Alexandria.

00:33.477 --> 00:36.221
So when you see my book, I start with Alexandria.

00:36.983 --> 00:38.525
Well, I like Bach as well.

00:38.826 --> 00:40.068
I like the way things come back.

00:40.108 --> 00:46.237
This is a little different than Alexandria, and it's different beyond the fact that just the fact that we have backup tapes.

00:47.259 --> 00:49.983
So I'd like Alexandria, which didn't.

00:50.003 --> 00:52.968
That's an excellent quote.

00:54.110 --> 00:59.839
The interesting thing about my role here, and it's really a role that's part of the group,

01:00.157 --> 01:05.625
the whole evolution of the Corvus archive, which is at the center, really, of all of our activities.

01:05.725 --> 01:07.908
We publish out of it.

01:07.928 --> 01:10.832
Our CD-ROMs celebrate the material that's in the archive.

01:10.972 --> 01:24.452
We license it out for reproduction rights, so we act as a resource to the traditional and even new publishing industries that materials that we have can be available for anyone engaging in those kinds of products.

01:24.532 --> 01:26.755
We intend to develop this as well.

01:27.410 --> 01:33.599
for educational and consumer applications as a research resource or an entertainment resource.

01:33.659 --> 01:39.708
So this is really, functions kind of like a library, but in one very different component.

01:39.728 --> 01:42.152
It's digital.

01:42.172 --> 01:49.603
Now, in terms of your first book, which I think, you know, if you mentioned

01:50.275 --> 01:53.679
then you'll probably have some kind of... Okay, Bach is in this as well.

01:53.699 --> 01:54.620
Open the second book.

01:54.640 --> 01:55.120
Go ahead.

01:55.160 --> 01:56.462
You know, the idea ties together.

01:56.502 --> 02:03.590
When it comes to books, I have to confess to being one of the afflicted.

02:04.310 --> 02:04.611
Okay.

02:04.631 --> 02:06.413
I mean, there's something about... You don't know my book?

02:06.433 --> 02:12.539
No, this is very odd, but I had to... I mean, it's one of these things where, you know, it's sort of like... I'll bring this book back to you if you'd like.

02:12.860 --> 02:13.761
I'd like to see it.

02:13.961 --> 02:16.023
It's like AA for anything else.

02:16.103 --> 02:17.965
I mean, AA for books for me was to stop.

02:18.045 --> 02:19.607
I had a huge private collection.

02:20.026 --> 02:21.528
But there's something I think about.

02:21.548 --> 02:22.009
There can't be.

02:22.029 --> 02:28.678
There's something about stroking 17th century vellum and just knowing and thinking about what that means.

02:28.758 --> 02:31.322
You don't know my book, A Gentle Madness?

02:31.342 --> 02:36.610
The subtitle is Bibliophiles, Bibliomains, and an Eternal Passion for Books.

02:36.830 --> 02:39.434
I had a full-page review in the New York Times.

02:39.514 --> 02:40.535
It boggles my mind.

02:40.635 --> 02:42.318
I was on Brian Lamb's show twice.

02:42.478 --> 02:44.641
In fact, he rebroadcasted this for Christmas.

02:44.681 --> 02:45.342
I love this.

02:46.098 --> 02:53.046
So I love books, and as a book lover, I do not feel by any stretch that the computer's going to replace the book.

02:53.106 --> 03:06.662
But there's a couple very different kinds of, and again, I'll show my limitations really with computers when I talk about this, but I think there's two fairly different things that we're talking about here.

03:07.242 --> 03:15.852
The computers and computer technology and visual archives, or the digital Alexandria that I'm talking about in terms of Corbus,

03:16.338 --> 03:18.461
and a real Alexandria.

03:19.202 --> 03:26.170
And one is, in its most basic level, is a tactile distinction.

03:26.931 --> 03:30.936
It's one of, what role do books play in our lives?

03:31.797 --> 03:38.465
And I have to say that for me, and for many people that I know, the role is more than just as an information resource.

03:39.186 --> 03:40.368
It's part of an experience.

03:40.388 --> 03:41.910
It's something that's really built.

03:43.372 --> 03:44.573
It's almost become genetic.

03:44.924 --> 03:47.889
It's about the urge to climb a tree when we hear the lion roar.

03:47.990 --> 04:00.252
I mean, when we think about our relationship with the printed words since its inception, and what role that's taken over from the days when knowledge was transmitted by storytellers and minstrels that wandered through the countryside.

04:00.272 --> 04:05.481
I mean, it's a very important role, I think, that's

04:05.933 --> 04:07.295
that books have taken over.

04:07.895 --> 04:25.337
And I don't think that computers and computer information and computer technology, the computer's ability to organize and present and retrieve massive amounts of information, is really going to replace an experience that sort of has its roots almost in the spiritual and cultural and personal aspects of who we are as a species.

04:25.517 --> 04:28.520
I mean, this is, you know, my own view on this.

04:28.641 --> 04:35.569
Well, there's a distinctive difference between information and the kind of knowledge

04:36.173 --> 04:37.574
that you get in a book.

04:37.674 --> 04:46.303
I mean, a computer does data and information, but is that the appropriate vehicle for, you know, what we're talking about in terms of books?

04:46.903 --> 05:02.198
Well, it's really interesting to look at the advent of some of the new publishing, the attempts to do magazines on the web and do editorial commentary on magazines on the web, so clearly people are working around this notion that there's

05:02.870 --> 05:14.322
that computers are one of the next steps in how we share information between each other and how we share information on a global level and to an extent never before possible by the printed page.

05:15.344 --> 05:27.797
And interestingly enough, in ways that can be very personal, you know, it's not been the case in the past where you or I or anyone as an individual, whether they're a photographer or a writer, could simply

05:28.638 --> 05:38.831
in a very quick period of time, publish our own manuscript, you know, whether it's words or visuals or a combination of both, talk about issues or ideas that are important to us.

05:38.931 --> 05:47.763
Now, with the advent of the web and computers, we can do that and reach an audience far broader than any traditional publisher might have been able to do.

05:48.463 --> 05:52.789
But is that really the same as publishing a book?

05:53.427 --> 06:06.522
I would argue that there's distinctions that are so deep as to go beyond the simple argument that computers could organize the information better and could distribute it more broadly and do it much quicker.

06:07.103 --> 06:12.409
But it's how I feel about the role that books play in our culture, what they've evolved into.

06:14.011 --> 06:17.975
It's a pretty interesting position you find yourself in, isn't it, you personally?

06:18.416 --> 06:18.716
It is.

06:19.176 --> 06:19.477
It is.

06:19.597 --> 06:22.320
I mean, in this company, in this place,

06:22.604 --> 06:31.775
at this time, with the technology you have available to you and the mandate, apparently, that you've been... In fact, for the record, why don't you tell me what your position is, your title?

06:32.536 --> 06:37.863
Well, the director of media development, in terms of it's my responsibilities for building the archive.

06:37.903 --> 06:47.234
I mean, the mandate for how that archive, the look and feel and scope and breadth and depth of the archive, really comes from Bill, in Bill's vision for how this should look.

06:47.254 --> 06:49.557
Bill Gates.

06:50.431 --> 07:05.772
The summary I like to use is that this archive is about, in the process of building, is about creating a visual resource, a visual encyclopedia, if you will, that spans the whole of human experience through time.

07:06.573 --> 07:08.115
And it does that across media.

07:09.016 --> 07:11.920
Now we're focusing on the still image in art.

07:11.940 --> 07:17.367
We'll broaden that out over time, and as technology allows to include film and video and sound and text,

07:17.819 --> 07:24.506
and other media has evolved, and they'll all be linked together so that we create the relationships between those different components.

07:24.606 --> 07:27.969
But now the focus is on still imagery and art.

07:28.570 --> 07:32.434
So you must confer often with Bill?

07:33.114 --> 07:35.076
I don't personally, a couple times a year.

07:35.096 --> 07:40.282
But you pretty much, does he give you an idea of what the kinds of things that he will... Yes, he does.

07:40.862 --> 07:46.628
And, you know, our senior... Not marching orders per se, but just the general philosophical

07:47.435 --> 07:51.300
Yeah, sort of, you know, sort of, yes, we'd like this to be editorial in nature.

07:51.321 --> 07:54.124
We'd like the materials to be informative and informational.

07:54.685 --> 08:07.704
We'd like these to be images or pictures of art that not only are art and talking about art as a part of the cultural experience, but also art as a window into the human experience pre-photography.

08:08.124 --> 08:17.037
Because at a certain point in time, you have to go, you quickly slip beyond the realm of photography, and now you're into the realm of words and art.

08:17.708 --> 08:26.625
And the other things that we used to capture, the wood blocks, or whatever we used to capture and depict human experience, our daily lives.

08:26.845 --> 08:30.452
However, that was pre-photography.

08:31.674 --> 08:33.558
Those are the resources that we have to draw on.

08:33.598 --> 08:39.649
And you can sort of step that back to cave paintings of our prehistoric, you know,

08:40.051 --> 08:45.137
natural history counterparts, whether it's a mastodon or an antelope on a wall in a cave in southern France.

08:45.177 --> 08:50.464
So you can actually, now we may capture that with photography, but the art itself is, you know.

08:50.484 --> 08:52.046
Do you have a comprehensive scheme?

08:53.267 --> 08:55.770
We do, and it's one that we're constantly refining.

08:55.810 --> 09:03.940
In fact, a major project that I have underway now is to really begin to create a new road map, you know, for the archive.

09:04.021 --> 09:07.645
And that's so critical for a number of reasons, is that

09:08.452 --> 09:10.734
How do you think about a road map like that?

09:10.754 --> 09:18.241
Kind of the way that I've thought about it, characterized it in the past as an example, just by way of illustration.

09:20.583 --> 09:36.016
Let's take any one of our major encyclopedias, maybe Encyclopedia Britannica, and if you take the Britannica and you blow all of the body text out of it, you're left with a lot of headings and subheadings that represent different categories of human experience.

09:36.036 --> 09:36.957
Great life.

09:37.223 --> 09:41.167
information about the world that we live in, we've developed in.

09:41.207 --> 10:02.151
And if you were to take Latin America's equivalent of Britannica, and Africa's equivalent of Britannica, and India's equivalent of Britannica, and do the same thing, and then merge it, you know, delete the similars, you begin to get a structure of knowledge and a structure of

10:03.633 --> 10:10.940
human experience of the different categories of that in our science, our literature, our art, our history, okay?

10:10.960 --> 10:17.827
All of those pieces at that very top level become like markers, or almost become like vessels.

10:18.488 --> 10:19.469
They're the key events.

10:19.489 --> 10:20.951
They're the key cultural things.

10:20.991 --> 10:26.416
They're the key parts of science and technology that we've developed.

10:26.436 --> 10:32.222
Our task is, in looking at that kind of very comprehensive structure,

10:32.540 --> 10:47.355
to find the visual materials, primarily again now photography, and fill those vessels, each one of those categories, with the right amount, and that's always an issue, of illustration, what illustrates that.

10:47.375 --> 10:51.960
When you're talking about photography, you're talking about photographs of images, not necessarily photographs of events.

10:52.100 --> 10:53.621
Well, it could be photographs of events, too.

10:53.802 --> 11:01.990
Photojournalism, for example, is of major importance to us, because what you see now in contemporary photojournalism is really

11:02.257 --> 11:10.206
compelling documents that will be our history tomorrow, just as when you step back and you look at, you know, the work done around the Civil War and how compelling.

11:10.226 --> 11:13.971
I mean, Ken Burns did this amazing series, all out of still images.

11:14.091 --> 11:14.771
Amazing.

11:14.812 --> 11:15.272
Amazing.

11:15.813 --> 11:17.495
Amazing.

11:17.515 --> 11:28.247
That's actually an interesting thing about how computers might function to give us insight, how they may differ from a book, because, you know, what he did really for PBS, similar

11:28.480 --> 11:35.170
analogies in terms of structure and presentation and organization, I think we'll see that on the web.

11:35.270 --> 11:38.896
How about developing the narrative aspects of the film?

11:38.956 --> 11:40.899
Well, sound is going to be part of that.

11:41.880 --> 11:51.535
When you get a chance to spend time with Curtis Wong, who's developed some of our titles, you'll begin to see, I think, some of the shape of

11:51.920 --> 11:59.733
how the computer is going to be used, how it's going to relate to books, because what you see on a CD-ROM maybe is a stepping stone.

12:00.775 --> 12:16.982
I look at CD-ROMs, again, with my limited understanding of the technology involved, but I sort of look at CD-ROMs as really laying the groundwork for what's going to take place over the Internet or what's going to come down through our cables.

12:17.907 --> 12:22.171
It'll probably come down through multiple channels of distribution directly into our homes.

12:22.372 --> 12:27.237
Now, you say you're a limited knowledge of the technology, so why don't you tell me a little bit about your background?

12:28.037 --> 12:28.278
Excuse me.

12:28.398 --> 12:28.918
I'm sorry.

12:28.938 --> 12:30.420
I'm sorry.

12:31.901 --> 12:35.645
You know, my background is in biochemistry and botany.

12:35.665 --> 12:36.967
Are you from around here?

12:36.987 --> 12:37.347
San Francisco.

12:37.367 --> 12:39.569
I went to school in Berkeley, California.

12:40.130 --> 12:44.134
I've always been on the West Coast.

12:44.671 --> 12:58.052
my background in the sciences, but also beyond that I spent most of my life struggling against the academic institutions to create an interdisciplinary major that integrated science and philosophy and religion.

12:58.072 --> 12:58.332
Interesting.

12:58.352 --> 13:00.075
They never quite gave it to me.

13:00.095 --> 13:07.607
They were always absolutely sure that that was such a philosophical position that I thought I should be a philosophy major and forget that.

13:08.110 --> 13:10.113
I have a firm belief that there's integration.

13:10.173 --> 13:13.478
I do not see simple distinctions between those three.

13:13.498 --> 13:15.481
I see them as integrated deeply.

13:15.541 --> 13:18.485
I not only think that way, I feel that way.

13:19.086 --> 13:21.189
So how did you get into this?

13:22.050 --> 13:27.819
It became really clear to me that my future was not going to be doing scientific research.

13:28.119 --> 13:34.168
I had a couple of interesting experiences that really convinced me that was not the route I wanted to go down.

13:34.790 --> 13:41.357
I had a passion for photography, and decided, well, the best thing you do with that kind of background is become a photographer.

13:41.377 --> 13:43.960
Visual communication is really important to me.

13:43.980 --> 14:01.680
I mean, you have to remember, I was kind of a child of the 60s and 70s, you know, late 60s, early 70s, so a lot of my background was informed of coming out of the civil rights movement, Berkeley, free speech, you know, from Hayden.

14:01.741 --> 14:03.042
Well, I'm from Sam, from...

14:03.410 --> 14:05.232
The 60s is my decade as well.

14:05.332 --> 14:07.455
Same age probably as I am.

14:07.495 --> 14:14.703
So, you know, one of the biggest frustrations I had at that time was really how the flow of information was controlled.

14:14.963 --> 14:30.261
And not just in the, you know, trying to bring civil rights issues to a broader awareness, but a lot of the issues around the Vietnam War and international policy and world policy and the nature of world governments and how do governments communicate with each other, or more particularly,

14:30.528 --> 14:33.973
How do governments get in the way of populations communicating with each other?

14:33.993 --> 14:44.107
And it was an ongoing frustration for me, you know, whether it's the subtle or gross signs of censorship and the free flow of information around this planet.

14:44.127 --> 14:45.109
Major frustration.

14:45.910 --> 14:57.126
And I can think of a dozen little instances in my own personal research and work I was doing where I remember getting books from

14:57.477 --> 15:03.575
a library that was involved with the Vatican where the book arrived finally after months of trying to get it.

15:04.618 --> 15:07.166
Comparative religion is an area of interest of mine.

15:07.186 --> 15:11.298
And the book was sealed in tape that said Carcer in Latin around it.

15:11.318 --> 15:12.381
And it hadn't been opened.

15:13.103 --> 15:16.187
God knows how many.

15:16.207 --> 15:17.889
You got this at Berkeley?

15:17.949 --> 15:24.096
I got it through a very, actually a combination of working through Berkeley and the Theological Seminary.

15:24.116 --> 15:26.299
They sent it from Rome here for you to study?

15:26.439 --> 15:29.022
Yeah, to look at it, and I had to break the tape on it to look at it.

15:29.042 --> 15:29.643
Wow.

15:29.663 --> 15:32.967
But it was that idea and how hard it was to get that in on.

15:34.148 --> 15:36.351
It was a physical obstruction.

15:36.551 --> 15:37.352
It was tape.

15:37.372 --> 15:38.694
It was literally tape around it.

15:38.714 --> 15:41.237
But this wasn't an index to talk about it.

15:41.470 --> 15:43.833
Paul Leclerc at the New York Public Library.

15:43.853 --> 15:44.133
His book.

15:44.434 --> 15:46.436
Yeah, but he told me of an instance in the 60s.

15:46.556 --> 15:47.898
He was a few years older than I am.

15:47.918 --> 15:48.779
He was 56.

15:49.900 --> 15:53.104
And he studied at Holy Cross College in Massachusetts.

15:53.285 --> 15:54.166
They sealed their books.

15:54.686 --> 16:05.720
Well, he had to request permission from the bishop in the 60s, 63, 64, to read, was it Reveille, or, you know, it wasn't Voltaire, but it was somebody.

16:05.940 --> 16:10.566
And then the Jesuit brother, teaching the course, had to get permission as well.

16:10.867 --> 16:13.611
I mean, I said, what did the bishop say?

16:13.932 --> 16:15.114
Did he ask you to be careful?

16:15.214 --> 16:17.938
I mean, he said, no, he just gave us permission.

16:17.958 --> 16:23.146
But it's amazing, isn't it, how recently, that's why I'm wondering when you said it was sealed, you know.

16:23.166 --> 16:26.691
It's a book on Gnosticism, research work on Gnosticism.

16:26.711 --> 16:31.279
Not that it's that important for this, but you get, that was, it was very, well, we don't know.

16:31.299 --> 16:38.730
No, it is important because I've talked to Harold Bloom for this book, by the way, and of course he's the, you know, Gnosticism is major

16:39.689 --> 16:40.910
consideration of his.

16:42.252 --> 16:51.001
So we have an early Christianity trying to define itself, and we have all these Neoplatonic cults we have, and the Gnostics were very powerful.

16:51.021 --> 16:58.789
The Gnostics, in some people's opinion, might be closer to the original teachings of Jesus than maybe what we've inherited.

17:01.232 --> 17:08.920
Church is there today, but there were concerns as to why they would not want to have

17:09.322 --> 17:12.066
that kind of information broadly disseminated.

17:12.547 --> 17:14.590
I've even purchased books out of collections.

17:15.811 --> 17:16.212
For yourself?

17:16.553 --> 17:23.142
For myself, where they were sealed similarly with tape, and that probably came out of seminaries that were sold but were never even opened.

17:25.045 --> 17:32.055
At any rate, I mean, the interesting part, I suppose, of how that all ties together is I, you know, sort of making the decision to move into photography

17:32.710 --> 17:37.435
At the same time, I opened a bookstore that I was just finishing my college career.

17:37.455 --> 17:38.296
Amazing you haven't heard of my book.

17:38.316 --> 17:39.297
I suppose new.

17:39.417 --> 17:40.177
I know, I know.

17:40.218 --> 17:41.439
This was a while ago.

17:41.459 --> 17:43.541
How late are you going to be here tonight?

17:43.661 --> 17:44.422
Probably about five.

17:44.822 --> 17:47.385
All right, if I'm out of here before that, I'll try and drop it back.

17:47.625 --> 17:48.085
I'd be great.

17:48.105 --> 17:48.766
I'd love to see it.

17:48.786 --> 17:49.267
Before I go.

17:49.867 --> 17:51.329
I'd probably go crazy by something.

17:51.669 --> 17:52.770
I'm amazed.

17:53.150 --> 17:55.673
But, you know, a lot of things happened.

17:55.693 --> 17:56.614
I had to let that go.

17:56.654 --> 17:59.697
But the interesting thing was to tie this all back together.

18:00.014 --> 18:05.880
But that's why, by the way, I hope you'll allow me to call you with some... Absolutely.

18:05.900 --> 18:07.842
...after I transcribe this thing.

18:07.862 --> 18:08.222
Absolutely.

18:08.242 --> 18:12.807
And I like to, and I, by the way, there are no surprises with me.

18:12.827 --> 18:16.851
I'm happy to go over quotes with you, you know, prior to publication.

18:17.312 --> 18:19.774
Yeah, especially things related to Gnosticism, the Church.

18:19.794 --> 18:20.875
Well, that's incredible.

18:20.955 --> 18:21.876
Are you Catholic?

18:21.896 --> 18:22.357
No.

18:22.377 --> 18:27.642
I should call you.

18:28.313 --> 18:42.072
Well, you know, the interesting thing was, is when I first, you know, most of us, when we started using computers for information, it was like the LexisNexis, and it was database, and it was textural research only.

18:42.112 --> 18:57.814
But when I really began to see a lot of what was taking place, and a number of things actually affected my thinking about what modern technology and communications, whether it's a fax machine or a photocopier or

18:58.267 --> 19:06.696
you know, a computer and a modem in the Internet is doing in terms of breaking down those barriers that frustrated me in the 60s and 70s.

19:07.457 --> 19:08.538
So I'm bringing it up to date.

19:09.059 --> 19:13.804
When I first stumbled into this project here... Now, did you stumble into it?

19:14.204 --> 19:16.587
Actually, I came here to interview them for an article I was writing.

19:16.627 --> 19:18.289
Who gave them?

19:18.349 --> 19:18.970
No, Corbis.

19:18.990 --> 19:19.350
Oh, I see.

19:20.331 --> 19:22.393
I didn't know who Bill was at that time.

19:22.454 --> 19:23.835
He was not on my radar.

19:24.541 --> 19:26.905
Again, I'm not a technologist.

19:26.925 --> 19:28.868
Computers really were a tool for me.

19:28.888 --> 19:32.313
You're perfect for my book, by the way.

19:32.333 --> 19:33.835
Well, computers were not a tool for me.

19:33.855 --> 19:37.481
I mean, they were a tool, but they were not... I had no idea who Bill Gates really was.

19:37.541 --> 19:42.008
Even the first time I met him, I was in a six-hour meeting here with him and a number of other staff.

19:42.028 --> 19:42.809
And he was at the meeting?

19:42.969 --> 19:49.519
He was at the meeting, and I, you know... Yeah, Microsoft, I kind of knew what that was, but I've never read any articles about him.

19:49.887 --> 19:55.475
He was wealthy, but he wasn't as wealthy as Warren Buffett, who was always kind of one of my heroes, and so he wasn't even on my radar.

19:55.495 --> 19:59.982
And really, he didn't even start to become profiled, really, until a few years ago.

20:00.242 --> 20:03.527
I mean, the first I had ever heard of him was in 60 Minutes, you know.

20:03.547 --> 20:08.494
Well, I'm sitting here listening to this guy talk, and he wasn't really addressing any long soliloquy or anything else.

20:08.514 --> 20:17.747
He was just answering and having a dialogue with the staff about sort of the organizational structure and long-term plans, from his point of view, for this company.

20:17.767 --> 20:18.949
And I'm listening to this going...

20:19.756 --> 20:48.970
this is part of the answer this technology with this kind of commitment with this kind of vision is the kind of thing that really can touch deep down into concerns i have about the democracy of information okay if we're very good and very thoughtful about how we build this resource this is not going to be the only resource like this there's other archives like this okay and there will be other archives developing like this but if we can lead and set an example of how you build

20:49.372 --> 20:56.782
a resource like this and be very smart about how we do it in terms of getting both the breadth and the depth.

20:57.263 --> 21:02.290
And even in doing that, be sure that we really build into this a multicultural perspective.

21:02.330 --> 21:12.865
So as we think about world history or human culture, it's not just another white North American male's perspective on that, that we draw out of the very cultures we're trying to cover.

21:13.283 --> 21:41.144
So if we're going to deal with the Hispanic culture of Latin America, or we're going to deal with the Islamic culture of North Africa or the Mediterranean, that we draw on photographers, for example, who grew up in that culture, who speak that language, who understand them, who are part of that culture, so that when we see, whether they're photojournalists, those cultures, through those eyes, their photographs are informed by the same kind of knowledge that a North American photographer would be informed when they were photographing culture here.

21:41.244 --> 21:42.987
What is cultural significance?

21:44.047 --> 21:47.050
And it's powerful how critical that is.

21:47.891 --> 21:49.313
Let me give you one quick example.

21:49.853 --> 21:53.778
And this was just serendipity in a way, but it played directly into it.

21:54.238 --> 21:57.582
I had a photographer came through who showed me his portfolio.

21:57.602 --> 22:06.372
And among the other things, he'd shot for several major national and international publications dealing with people, culture, national geographic style of work.

22:08.594 --> 22:13.800
And one of the things he had was coverage of a market in Ecuador, one of those public markets.

22:13.949 --> 22:18.614
And you looked into it, and there was color and all the flowers and vegetables and colorful robes.

22:18.654 --> 22:23.700
And everyone was looking away from the camera, concentrating on their activities.

22:23.740 --> 22:30.548
Maybe there was a couple people in the distance that were kind of looking on a slightly disturbed way back at the intrusion of the photographer into that moment.

22:31.669 --> 22:33.011
But it was a good document.

22:33.031 --> 22:37.977
You really got a sense that you could see what they were selling, what kind of produce, what kind of textiles.

22:38.217 --> 22:39.398
You could get a sense of that.

22:39.418 --> 22:42.522
It was very visually quite stunning.

22:43.227 --> 22:43.948
That's not bad.

22:44.328 --> 22:47.152
You know, it's a photographer here in the States.

22:48.333 --> 22:57.183
The next day, the very next day, a photographer, an Ecuadorian photographer from Quito comes in, and I'm going through his portfolio.

22:57.263 --> 22:57.704
Comes in here.

22:57.924 --> 22:58.345
Comes in here.

22:58.365 --> 23:02.770
So they're coming here basically trying to sell their... It's a license to try to figure out, what are we doing?

23:02.830 --> 23:03.951
Is there a relationship?

23:03.971 --> 23:08.256
And I had met this guy in Europe, oddly enough, but I hadn't seen any of his work.

23:08.793 --> 23:10.656
I saw a book that he had published.

23:10.676 --> 23:11.457
This is the Ecuadorian.

23:11.477 --> 23:12.639
The Ecuadorian, okay.

23:12.679 --> 23:14.341
So we'd already had a relationship.

23:14.782 --> 23:18.288
You know, we had everything in this business is relationship.

23:18.308 --> 23:22.474
And so we established a relationship first, and then he was bringing the work to me to look at.

23:23.075 --> 23:23.936
So I'm going through it.

23:23.956 --> 23:28.123
The third picture I hit is the same market piece.

23:28.143 --> 23:31.348
Now, I mean, and my breath stopped.

23:31.408 --> 23:36.235
I'm looking at this picture, and there's a person who's sort of carrying this big,

23:36.535 --> 23:42.480
thing of vegetables, and they're moving into the frame from the right-hand side, and they're looking back, and they're smiling into the camera.

23:42.821 --> 23:48.106
And you look at the market, and there's people around, and the people aren't looking suspiciously from a distance.

23:48.166 --> 23:49.267
There's no halt.

23:49.307 --> 23:50.928
The activity doesn't look frozen.

23:50.968 --> 23:51.989
There's motion people.

23:52.009 --> 23:54.251
There are a couple people that are looking at the camera, smiling.

23:54.451 --> 23:54.732
Why?

23:54.772 --> 23:55.793
He's one of their own people.

23:55.813 --> 23:56.954
He's one of their own people.

23:57.894 --> 23:59.756
And it was night and day.

23:59.796 --> 24:03.840
The other one was a dead document in my mind at that point.

24:03.860 --> 24:03.960
Okay.

24:04.379 --> 24:08.886
Technically it was perfect, because I described it the first time it would have worked.

24:08.926 --> 24:14.174
But when you get into, okay, what happens when it's someone who participates in that culture?

24:14.975 --> 24:17.599
Maybe it would be worthwhile to even acquire both.

24:19.121 --> 24:19.462
Could be.

24:19.782 --> 24:23.047
I mean, you know, there's a number of... But then, again, of course, for your purposes, you won't.

24:24.469 --> 24:25.611
I'm just thinking in terms of...

24:26.266 --> 24:31.173
A statement that goes to express what you just articulated, you know?

24:31.234 --> 24:38.484
Yeah, well, there's similar issues, because, you know, when we think about photography as art and what that means, and there's pieces to this.

24:38.525 --> 24:49.241
There's the information that's in a photograph or a piece of art, okay, which we've just kind of gave an example of one, but there's also the work in and of itself, okay?

24:49.261 --> 24:51.624
Now, what do you do in terms of issues of restoration?

24:51.945 --> 24:53.387
I mean, we've sort of...

24:53.722 --> 24:58.352
had the experience of seeing the Sistine Chapel and what that represented, but what about photographs?

24:58.933 --> 25:08.052
Photographs taken in the, you know, even photographs in the Vietnam War area, or photographs of the civil rights, if they were color transparency, were already starting to get color shifts.

25:09.255 --> 25:12.281
You know, this doesn't look quite the way it does now.

25:12.341 --> 25:14.245
Now, when we scan those in,

25:14.377 --> 25:15.479
Is it like an old book?

25:15.499 --> 25:16.360
Do we rebind it?

25:16.560 --> 25:17.762
Do we take away the vellum?

25:17.782 --> 25:21.869
Do we put on a modern leather cover just because it's a little worn along the edges?

25:21.889 --> 25:25.775
So you address these, you have these issues that are... Well, you have to talk about it.

25:25.795 --> 25:27.237
How do we deal with that now?

25:27.297 --> 25:29.941
Well, what's the, do you have a policy?

25:31.944 --> 25:34.248
For instance, I can think of a Matthew Brady photograph.

25:34.348 --> 25:36.732
Oops, sorry about that.

25:36.752 --> 25:36.992
Hold on.

25:37.968 --> 25:42.293
Well, at this point, we don't make those changes without working with the photographer.

25:42.313 --> 25:56.469
In many instances, with the photographers, the common agreement is that we look to restoring where we can, and with their cooperation, restoring that image to the original so it mirrors the intent of the photographer when they took the picture.

25:56.889 --> 25:59.932
That's only done with the photographer's permission and participation.

26:00.053 --> 26:01.754
So very limited at this point.

26:01.955 --> 26:05.899
It's an expensive process, and it's an investment for us.

26:07.313 --> 26:17.624
I mean, interestingly enough, when I, just to feed back to you on your comment, when I asked, in a meeting here, I asked Bill about that, he said, well, why not both?

26:19.467 --> 26:24.192
Because that is sort of the aging of the transition, the maturation of the medium, and what does that mean?

26:24.292 --> 26:25.914
I don't know.

26:25.934 --> 26:31.660
I mean, there's a whole, there's a lot of issues about photojournalism and reportage, and what is the intent of this photography?

26:31.680 --> 26:36.966
And it's, well, arguably, there's a lot of art in that work, and there's a lot of artistry in producing

26:37.300 --> 26:38.742
wonderful photojournalism.

26:39.063 --> 26:43.489
It's also about the capturing of essential information.

26:44.891 --> 26:46.434
Yeah, but, you know, it's a very interesting point.

26:46.454 --> 26:56.789
When you think of what the intent of the photographer was in a photojournalistic situation in the 60s, I don't think he wanted that image to fade or to discolor.

26:56.889 --> 26:57.871
That's why we go back.

26:57.891 --> 26:59.914
So that's why you do correct it.

27:00.354 --> 27:06.784
You send a probe to the planets, and they have to correct those images to make them appear, you know,

27:07.220 --> 27:20.522
So we have comfort with that, but now we step back, and you can think of the famous image of Lincoln, you know, in his hat, the portrait where the water stain on the original negative kind of came down, and up in the corner above his head, you've got this weird little liver-shaped mark, you know.

27:20.542 --> 27:29.176
Do we fix that, or is now that image so much a piece of history that it would be analogous to our taking Photoshop and removing the crack out of a Liberty Bell?

27:29.997 --> 27:30.578
You know, I mean...

27:31.013 --> 27:32.735
I mean, where are the lines?

27:32.755 --> 27:35.719
I mean, this is all of these issues are the issues of the new frontier.

27:35.839 --> 27:44.270
But the lip taking the crack, I mean, just to continue the metaphor, taking the crack out of the Liberty Bill, you're fooling around with real life at that point.

27:44.290 --> 27:51.640
If you're correcting a watermark on the negative, that happened quite apart from the artist who took the picture.

27:51.760 --> 27:54.123
Well, it goes back to the comment I made on the Matthew Brady story.

27:54.143 --> 27:55.625
Well, that's why I brought it up here.

27:55.685 --> 27:58.489
In that kind of nostalgic perspective,

27:58.908 --> 28:02.052
They're all questions.

28:02.092 --> 28:05.818
I like the idea of both, but you brought up the Sistine Chapel.

28:05.858 --> 28:11.545
The bottom line is they went and fixed it and arguably made it better.

28:12.326 --> 28:19.316
Whether or not they restored it to what it was in the image of the artist is a whole other matter.

28:19.536 --> 28:27.227
So when a photographer like the Ecuadorian you mentioned comes in and the American the day before, you're basically passing

28:27.612 --> 28:32.659
judgment, professional judgment on what kinds of images you want for the archive, I guess.

28:33.159 --> 28:37.705
So you will acquire licensing rights to these, and they'll enter the archive.

28:37.805 --> 28:40.229
And as Laurie pointed out to me, then you'll keyword it.

28:40.269 --> 28:45.315
I mean, it's not going to do you any good if people don't know what you have and how to get it, right?

28:45.335 --> 28:45.676
That's right.

28:45.696 --> 28:46.417
Absolutely right.

28:46.437 --> 28:51.063
So you're basically what, as I mentioned earlier, the publishers would call an acquisitions editor.

28:51.083 --> 28:53.326
Is that kind of roughly analogous?

28:53.346 --> 28:55.729
Yeah, that would be it.

28:56.485 --> 29:01.934
Your attitudes, I guess, your worldview plays a very critical part in all this, doesn't it?

29:02.535 --> 29:04.638
I mean, what you think is relevant.

29:05.961 --> 29:07.723
It's a group process, though, understand.

29:07.764 --> 29:09.647
It's not just me, but it's a group process.

29:09.667 --> 29:11.550
And we partner with a lot of experts in the field.

29:11.570 --> 29:13.032
And we draw heavily.

29:13.092 --> 29:13.934
That's a very good point.

29:13.954 --> 29:15.536
We draw heavily on experts in the field.

29:15.556 --> 29:23.269
And interestingly enough, in the area of photography, since we're talking about that, we draw heavily on the photographers themselves because they were there at that point.

29:23.384 --> 29:29.012
So if you have a photographer that was working in Chechnya or Bosnia... So we're talking about contempt, obviously.

29:29.452 --> 29:30.594
When you go back, you can't.

29:30.774 --> 29:32.857
Unless there were diary entries or whatever.

29:32.877 --> 29:35.981
Yeah, or west, you can go into the day books, and you can dig back into it.

29:36.923 --> 29:43.952
No, I mean, there's a certain amount of choice that has to be made, and it's very much the same process that a librarian would have to go through.

29:43.972 --> 29:46.776
Because, you know, we understand the idea that we want breadth.

29:47.127 --> 29:58.602
And within each one of those, we want depth so that we adequately illustrate it and that that depth is to a degree that's useful for research, for education, for consumers, or for someone that just has personal interest.

29:59.063 --> 30:01.245
And it's critical that those are the right choices.

30:01.746 --> 30:06.532
I mean, a good example is if you take someone who's a train buff or an aviation buff.

30:07.614 --> 30:13.962
When we develop transportation sub-theme trains, sub-theme aircraft or aviation,

30:15.038 --> 30:24.391
trains, we have to make sure that we have good images and that we have the right images and we cover the major types of locomotion and the history of the development of that.

30:24.451 --> 30:26.354
So we have narrow gauge, wide gauge, steam.

30:27.396 --> 30:31.461
You better have a New York Central engine and you better have a Santa Fe engine too.

30:31.542 --> 30:32.423
The right ones.

30:32.443 --> 30:37.991
Because the thing is, even if it's an individual, they're an expert in the areas of their particular passion.

30:38.191 --> 30:40.995
So if we think about the value of this as a resource,

30:41.667 --> 30:47.173
You know, we may not be able to do everything ultimately, but the areas that we do, we have to think very good about.

30:47.193 --> 30:52.939
It's very much like the librarian that has, you know, 72,000 square feet in their library.

30:53.520 --> 30:59.266
Well, by the way, that only is going to hold a certain number of books and administrative support staff and everything else, okay?

30:59.527 --> 31:00.728
It's public areas.

31:00.888 --> 31:04.452
It's only going to hold a certain number of volumes before they have to add the wings.

31:04.853 --> 31:07.998
So how many books on trains are they going to put on those shelves?

31:08.338 --> 31:09.440
And which books are they?

31:09.560 --> 31:11.082
Which ones are the most informative?

31:11.142 --> 31:12.484
Which ones are the essential?

31:14.887 --> 31:24.642
Just to go back to a couple of things, when you chose to go into photography, was this as a photographer or a historian?

31:24.722 --> 31:25.663
As a photographer.

31:25.812 --> 31:26.233
Really?

31:26.253 --> 31:28.537
In the areas that were of particular passion to me.

31:28.558 --> 31:29.960
It was visual communication.

31:30.121 --> 31:31.744
That's what really interested me.

31:31.824 --> 31:33.387
And did you work at this for a while?

31:33.407 --> 31:35.191
Twenty-five years, and I'm still in fact.

31:35.271 --> 31:37.175
That's one of yours?

31:37.335 --> 31:39.279
He's published several books.

31:39.299 --> 31:39.720
Really?

31:40.966 --> 31:42.469
Very well known in nature.

31:42.489 --> 31:45.153
I'll swap you with gentle madness for one of yours.

31:45.173 --> 31:45.834
It's a deal.

31:48.399 --> 31:51.063
Yeah, Charles has been in the industry for a very long time.

31:51.124 --> 31:51.825
It's a deal.

31:51.885 --> 31:56.172
His expertise has been instrumental in building this team and being able to build this resource.

31:56.252 --> 31:58.436
Well, I have a fair peculiar.

31:58.456 --> 32:00.139
It's kind of like you, I bet, you see.

32:00.322 --> 32:08.287
is that I have as much of a passion about the business of images and photography and visual communication as I do about making the images themselves.

32:08.307 --> 32:11.698
It's probably you and your love for books as well as your love for writing books.

32:12.387 --> 32:18.335
You'd probably make a great antiquarian book dealer, but could you do that full-time and still write about antiquarian books?

32:18.395 --> 32:20.798
I couldn't make any money being an antiquarian book dealer.

32:21.059 --> 32:21.499
I didn't.

32:21.780 --> 32:23.402
Plus, you did, you didn't.

32:23.502 --> 32:23.882
I didn't.

32:24.043 --> 32:26.005
I kept keeping them all.

32:27.047 --> 32:28.869
You can't sell the babies.

32:28.989 --> 32:30.471
I could not afford to.

32:30.491 --> 32:32.354
Well, you've got this thorough poster here.

32:32.454 --> 32:34.557
My wife and I acquired at a sale last year.

32:34.577 --> 32:38.181
This does not have to be in the tape.

32:38.202 --> 32:40.424
So you were a bookseller where, in San Francisco?

32:40.705 --> 32:42.327
No, Eureka, Northern California.

32:43.015 --> 32:44.281
What was the name of the store?

32:44.301 --> 32:45.205
It was called Osiris.

32:45.266 --> 32:49.586
It was a bookstore that really focused on comparative philosophy and religions.

32:50.791 --> 32:52.198
You were perfect for this job.

32:52.938 --> 32:54.841
I mean, so tell me how you heard about this job.

32:54.861 --> 32:56.223
You saw an advertisement for it?

32:57.786 --> 33:00.530
We very carefully developed our standards.

33:00.550 --> 33:05.678
Actually, I came here to interview them for an article, a series of articles I was writing on the future.

33:05.698 --> 33:06.239
You said that.

33:06.519 --> 33:13.951
Well, you know, among the other things, I mean, if you love books and you love photography, you always have the other fantasies for the things you want to do in your life.

33:14.011 --> 33:15.333
And I had about three.

33:15.373 --> 33:18.719
One of them was to, you know, work or run a nursery.

33:19.099 --> 33:20.802
And I love plants a lot.

33:21.136 --> 33:27.143
One of the others was to write, to be a writer, to try to get something published, and that was a big thing for me.

33:27.503 --> 33:37.094
And I convinced a magazine to allow me to write a series of articles on the future of photography, and the first on photography in general, stock photography in particular.

33:37.395 --> 33:40.398
And the future of photography was going to be one of the first articles.

33:41.359 --> 33:45.524
So I had kind of looked around among, you know, the industry, and who could I go interview?

33:45.604 --> 33:47.046
There you go.

33:48.728 --> 33:50.089
Sure.

33:50.109 --> 33:50.890
And when was this?

33:51.207 --> 33:51.808
Oh, 1993.

33:51.928 --> 33:52.389
Very recent.

33:53.390 --> 33:53.910
Late 93.

33:55.973 --> 34:05.666
I had asked a number of my acquaintances and friends, I mean, who do you know that would be a very interesting interview in a publication called Photo District News?

34:05.726 --> 34:06.927
It said, well, you really can't.

34:06.947 --> 34:07.268
Photo what news?

34:07.288 --> 34:14.056
Photo District News said you really can't interview, you can't write this article without interviewing Continuum, which was now Corbis.

34:14.938 --> 34:19.223
So I had, you know, directory information.

34:19.608 --> 34:22.373
That company was originally Continuum?

34:23.115 --> 34:26.601
We actually had that name during the research and development phase of the company.

34:26.762 --> 34:30.008
Two chapters of my new book, as I mentioned, two are Continuum chapters.

34:30.028 --> 34:35.037
When we went to send the products to market, there were 75 other Continuums in the U.S.

34:35.137 --> 34:35.538
alone.

34:35.578 --> 34:39.506
There is a publisher called Continuum, a small publisher in the East Coast.

34:39.726 --> 34:40.608
So what's Quervis?

34:40.628 --> 34:41.329
What does that mean?

34:41.545 --> 34:44.791
It was actually the result of a naming search that we did.

34:44.811 --> 34:51.644
It has a Latin root meaning of like a woven basket or vessel, but that really wasn't what we were after.

34:51.684 --> 34:56.854
All the naming criteria, it's got to be short, so many syllables, start with a hard consonant.

34:57.391 --> 35:02.644
You know, it was... I didn't know what Exxon went through when it changed over from... No nasty meanings in other languages.

35:02.724 --> 35:03.246
That's right.

35:03.266 --> 35:04.950
We had to do all the criteria.

35:05.010 --> 35:13.712
I mean, I'm from Massachusetts, where there's Wang computers, and I mean... That's why I said people...

35:13.692 --> 35:17.337
I mean, the joke, you know, I mean, how to name it for himself.

35:17.357 --> 35:27.449
Well, that's, I mean, you know, there's that classic story of the Chevy Nova on sale in Spanish countries where Nova means it doesn't go.

35:27.870 --> 35:29.151
Well, there you go.

35:29.311 --> 35:30.873
You know, it's a little low.

35:30.994 --> 35:43.429
Exxon was the classic case of that because they were changing the name and they went through, and this was long before there were computer searches, you know, it was a totally non-existent word that meant nothing in all the major languages of the world, you know.

35:43.679 --> 35:45.742
Sometimes that's the criteria you use.

35:45.763 --> 35:46.303
That's right.

35:46.344 --> 35:47.946
We were kind of serendipitous.

35:48.026 --> 35:49.128
But vessel is nice.

35:49.148 --> 35:55.379
You see, Richard Dubarry called books the vessels of sacred wisdom, you know, which I quote in my book.

35:55.860 --> 35:56.320
You'll see.

35:57.382 --> 36:01.008
Well, they'll never replace the troubadours and the minstrels, but yeah.

36:01.028 --> 36:01.910
They're all we have now.

36:01.930 --> 36:03.613
So tell me again, you said you were a collector.

36:03.733 --> 36:04.995
You had, did you, did,

36:05.448 --> 36:07.971
For some reason, there's a number of 17,000 books.

36:07.991 --> 36:09.253
Did you say that at the beginning?

36:09.293 --> 36:10.775
No, but I had quite a library.

36:10.875 --> 36:13.498
In fact, I sort of started taking over the rooms of my house.

36:14.299 --> 36:15.961
At some point, the master bedroom was gone.

36:16.001 --> 36:17.904
Another bedroom was gone.

36:17.924 --> 36:20.046
It was rows and rows.

36:20.086 --> 36:21.648
It was difficult for me to let them go.

36:22.189 --> 36:23.971
So now I have a lot of anecdotal references.

36:23.991 --> 36:24.612
Did you let them go?

36:24.812 --> 36:25.253
Yeah, I did.

36:25.894 --> 36:27.015
You sold them?

36:27.035 --> 36:29.518
I was involved with a divorce years ago.

36:29.879 --> 36:31.641
First marriage, and it's at my library.

36:33.410 --> 36:33.991
It was a shame.

36:34.071 --> 36:37.296
I did an interview with Joseph Hiller for my, I do a newspaper.

36:37.316 --> 36:38.557
Were you a collector, per se?

36:38.778 --> 36:42.824
I collected, primarily in comparative religion and philosophy.

36:43.545 --> 36:44.506
Original editions?

36:44.526 --> 36:46.249
Original editions as much as possible.

36:46.329 --> 36:48.632
So it was an antiquarian collection as well as a scholarly collection.

36:48.652 --> 36:50.254
Absolutely, yeah.

36:50.354 --> 36:54.380
And it was, I had a, I had a lot of very diverse interests.

36:54.420 --> 36:59.788
I mean, one of, one of the areas that I was quite interested in is, is, you know, sort of the

36:59.988 --> 37:19.718
what I thought of as the parallel religions, the parallel paths that religious truth took out of that era that you were talking about earlier, and what really, what happened to the Neoplatonist Gnostics, and where did that go, and what really, you know, formed the foundation of Masonry, for example, what involvement that they have with carrying on certain aspects of that,

37:20.812 --> 37:24.358
religious ideas and what influence did they have in political culture.

37:24.418 --> 37:32.250
So I did collect heavily in areas like that, whether it was trying to follow the Rosicrucian movement through and the Masonic movement.

37:33.392 --> 37:37.518
Did you get a tactile rush from handling exquisite things?

37:37.659 --> 37:38.921
Well, I mean, it was amazing for me.

37:38.941 --> 37:48.135
I remember stumbling onto this estate sale, and there was a set of seventeenth-century Robert Flood, early Rosicrucian.

37:48.757 --> 37:55.745
Well, his works, I mean, the vellum was, I mean, it was the white, it was soft, it was just like... Like a fig-y mane.

37:55.765 --> 37:58.048
Oh, it's just, it's like pearl.

37:58.569 --> 38:00.070
I mean, it's just so... Like marble.

38:00.411 --> 38:16.890
And these things, it was so amazing, see, that went, but the only memory I have is the musical director at the Shakespearean Festival in Ashland was doing his dissertation on Among Things, he needed Flood to do it, and the only copy of this book that was anywhere close was in the British Museum, so there's a little thing in the front of his dissertation.

38:17.309 --> 38:19.612
special thanks to Charles Monsi for the loan of it.

38:19.632 --> 38:21.575
So he's a book lover, he just loved it.

38:21.635 --> 38:23.818
He's a musician, but he had that sense, you know.

38:23.838 --> 38:32.350
I describe in my book, and this, everywhere I went, everybody I talked to, I had to handle the goods at some point.

38:32.631 --> 38:38.519
And it had to be, you know, and there was that moment, and there was always this great moment that would arrive, and it was unpredictable.

38:39.521 --> 38:45.249
But I describe this moment where I'm interviewing William Scheide, arguably the greatest book collector in the world.

38:45.389 --> 38:46.050
His collection

38:46.638 --> 38:49.603
at Princeton, still privately owned.

38:49.623 --> 38:52.287
Well, do you travel in search of stuff?

38:52.308 --> 38:53.870
Maybe you could tell me briefly about that.

38:54.171 --> 39:06.471
I mean, are you a book scout like in the... You know, it's funny because this is not the first job I've had where I traveled extensively, but this is the first time I didn't spend half my time in bookstores when I got there.

39:06.972 --> 39:11.059
Unfortunately, this job doesn't really allow me the chance to do that, although

39:11.360 --> 39:22.691
We do work with a number of libraries and cultural institutions, and one of the pleasures and the rewards of this work is having the opportunity to sort of walk through these museums.

39:22.971 --> 39:33.121
In many instances, have the senior staff who are very familiar with the work, who ordinarily would not have contact with the public, walk you through and look at the images.

39:33.201 --> 39:38.346
I think back on my first trip to the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, and it was like,

39:38.714 --> 39:39.935
Talk about not breeding.

39:40.396 --> 39:43.460
I mean, they had to finally pull me out of the building.

39:44.641 --> 39:50.428
You know, it was just like... So you do the negotiations, say, with the Hermitage and the Van Gogh?

39:50.568 --> 39:52.471
Some, not those particular ones.

39:52.591 --> 39:58.358
We have a pretty good team, and once it moves into a certain level of negotiation, that's hands... When's this battle station?

39:58.778 --> 39:59.919
It means I have another meeting.

40:01.101 --> 40:03.043
Well, I have to personalize my computers.

40:03.083 --> 40:06.207
Again, I'm not a... So to make them friendly and accessible, mine talk...

40:06.187 --> 40:09.170
But the battle station is... Star Trek, yeah.

40:09.190 --> 40:13.675
That means there's a meeting or something that's up there, so it says Red Alert.

40:15.017 --> 40:15.617
They have to talk.

40:16.298 --> 40:17.139
Spock's on there.

40:17.800 --> 40:19.081
I'm a Star Trek-y.

40:19.101 --> 40:19.662
What can I say?

40:20.543 --> 40:25.908
Although most of what it says is, you would like this when it starts up in the morning, it's Hal.

40:25.928 --> 40:28.832
Most of the voice on this is the Hal 9000 computer from 2000.

40:28.912 --> 40:30.894
Oh, I love that.

40:30.914 --> 40:32.275
Did he ask you if you want to take a shower?

40:32.295 --> 40:33.797
I'm sorry, I can't do that.

40:34.030 --> 40:37.234
Or to talk about how times change.

40:37.254 --> 40:42.360
You know, I got that tape to show my girls, and I'd never seen it before.

40:42.400 --> 40:44.382
It was just about a month or two ago.

40:44.402 --> 40:46.044
And I said, but look at this movie.

40:46.064 --> 40:48.827
This was 1969 or whatever it was.

40:48.867 --> 40:51.590
And they were projecting to 2001.

40:51.971 --> 40:53.733
But look how huge the computer is.

40:54.033 --> 40:57.317
See, they had no conception at that point of a computer, of a microchip.

40:57.457 --> 40:57.857
That's right.

40:58.238 --> 41:02.923
That computer, which would do more today than they envisioned for 2001,

41:03.089 --> 41:05.892
Well, you know, it would not nearly be that size, right?

41:05.912 --> 41:10.056
It would be just a very small, and we would probably keyboard things in it.

41:10.837 --> 41:12.899
It would be entirely different from what they visualized.

41:13.699 --> 41:19.605
Oh, you know, and the amazing thing is, I have to say, is that, you know, I was, I mean, long ago I was seduced by the book.

41:20.846 --> 41:21.587
You know what I mean?

41:21.607 --> 41:23.469
Long ago I was seduced by the book.

41:23.529 --> 41:32.758
More recently I've been seduced by the computer, and really, because for me books were in part an experience and in part about the information that's in them.

41:33.312 --> 41:35.437
And I really see the power of both.

41:36.559 --> 41:40.889
And I have to say, I love them both.

41:41.511 --> 41:46.562
And just to go back to, you mentioned that you see the CD-ROM

41:46.964 --> 42:10.322
adventure here more or less celebrating what's in the archives absolutely so that's more or less picking the high spots so to speak finding something where you can create a narrative around you know where you have enough density you have enough depth first breath within it and it's compelling it makes a compelling story and more importantly it's a story that's not only compelling but it's important that people would care about it that it would enrich them when they had it so it's

42:10.707 --> 42:16.914
It's really about the information and arranging in a very compelling way that are things that really mean something to people.

42:17.595 --> 42:19.678
I mean, Curtis Wong is an absolute genius.

42:21.019 --> 42:22.561
Don't tell him I said that.

42:22.681 --> 42:31.451
I mean, he really, in his sense of combining sound and text, but more importantly, visuals in a way that makes for a compelling story.

42:31.491 --> 42:34.555
I mean, the first product I ever saw of his had me in tears.

42:34.923 --> 42:35.804
Well, what was that?

42:35.824 --> 42:39.107
It was a thing he did with Pedro Meyer called I Photographed to Remember.

42:39.147 --> 42:40.668
It was just, this was years ago.

42:41.148 --> 42:43.130
And that's when, I mean, it was an about-face.

42:43.210 --> 42:50.136
I was fairly staunchly, as a photographer and as someone working in that industry, not particularly keen on digital.

42:51.217 --> 42:55.941
I saw that disc, I left the thing in tears, and I went there to argue against it.

42:55.981 --> 42:59.023
You know, I went out going, my God, this had just turned my life around.

42:59.184 --> 43:00.224
So you went over, haven't you?

43:00.244 --> 43:03.687
No, I mean, I just, it was, the power of it was really interesting.

43:03.707 --> 43:04.508
I mean,

43:04.690 --> 43:19.827
And then you also mentioned, and then we can wrap it up for now if you want, that you want this to, and you use the image of Alexandria, you know, you want this to be an Alexandrian kind of a library for the 21st century, I guess.

43:21.148 --> 43:26.894
So that suggests, you know, that there has to be a certain mass, a critical mass that you have to achieve.

43:26.914 --> 43:27.134
Absolutely.

43:27.455 --> 43:32.200
And do you have any specific goals in terms of numbers or in terms of

43:32.753 --> 43:39.384
Do you have a plan, or are you just acquiring, acquiring, and we hope that it will get some focus?

43:39.424 --> 43:40.666
No, it can't be that random.

43:40.686 --> 43:44.372
I think there really is a lot of thought and planning that goes into that.

43:44.392 --> 43:55.791
In terms of what the critical mass and critical number is, I don't think we've really been able to figure that out yet, because in a sense, and this may sound crass, but it's not really meant to be,

43:56.733 --> 44:01.884
The market, the markets that we service will help determine that mass.

44:02.145 --> 44:13.830
As we start working increasingly in the areas of education, with educational institutions, as our markets, even with the education, broaden out beyond North America, with consumers directly, even in licensing,

44:14.333 --> 44:27.113
we can work out this sort of encyclopedic overview of what this looks like, but in order to be a business at the same time, to make this whole thing work and to make it viable, we have to prioritize among that range against those markets.

44:27.133 --> 44:40.033
So as universities and K-12 start to tell us what really is interesting for curriculum planning, that'll influence where we go as publishers, news magazines, book publishers start to tell us what they're interested in.

44:40.413 --> 44:42.196
We'll start to prioritize on that.

44:42.596 --> 44:42.957
You see a

44:43.291 --> 44:48.677
In good examples, you see a lot of flurry of activity on planning up to the millennium, the year 2000, 2001.

44:49.538 --> 44:52.602
What kinds of materials are going to be used in that?

44:52.722 --> 45:06.378
Well, as you start to look at that, it's that process of analyzing and thinking through and reacting to that has sent us moving very quickly to build all of those images with a historic context.

45:07.340 --> 45:09.262
Because a lot of us are going to be looking back.

45:09.843 --> 45:11.104
When we hit 2000,

45:11.202 --> 45:19.853
That's going to be a very different New Year celebration, because a lot of more thoughtful people are really going to drift back over the last, you know.

45:19.873 --> 45:21.615
I told you my book is being published, right?

45:22.016 --> 45:22.577
Late 1999.

45:22.617 --> 45:22.837
Yeah.

45:23.017 --> 45:29.505
It's very important to just anticipate book culture, I guess.

45:30.186 --> 45:30.747
Book culture.

45:30.847 --> 45:33.390
The new title, by the way, is not a new book.

45:33.410 --> 45:37.075
It's a new project we were working on with the Medford Historic Society.

45:37.460 --> 45:40.383
and that wonderful collection, Civil War Photography.

45:40.603 --> 45:42.124
Oh, do that book?

45:42.205 --> 45:49.111
They're doing the book, but we have a relationship with them, and we're scanning in almost 2,000 images out of that collection.

45:49.652 --> 45:52.735
I didn't know that.

45:52.815 --> 45:58.160
But the interesting thing we did in order to be really true to that, because those are antique prints.

45:58.200 --> 46:01.323
In many cases, the print, the negative, no longer exists, just the print.

46:01.823 --> 46:03.805
So we're photographing those in color.

46:04.223 --> 46:12.236
on a very high-quality, high-resolution color film, and then scanning it in color so all the nuance and tone of these wonderful prints is captured.

46:12.316 --> 46:13.097
So we have that.

46:13.177 --> 46:14.239
So it's not just black and white.

46:14.259 --> 46:15.401
And where are you doing that?

46:15.701 --> 46:15.901
In situ?

46:15.921 --> 46:16.683
Or are you doing that?

46:16.703 --> 46:17.744
No, they're being scanned here.

46:17.764 --> 46:18.325
Are they?

46:18.926 --> 46:19.107
Oh, yeah.

46:19.127 --> 46:21.250
Not the photographs, the color photography.

46:21.270 --> 46:21.971
No, no, no.

46:22.111 --> 46:23.834
So that was a major, major story.

46:24.114 --> 46:30.805
Stephen Jay Gould, who I've interviewed for this book, very articulate on these subjects,

46:31.291 --> 46:35.464
He said, you know, he loves the computer for certain things, and he's a Civil War statue buff.

46:36.347 --> 46:44.271
Now, there's some kind of project going on where every Civil War era statue in the whole United States is being photographed and scanned.

46:44.555 --> 46:50.644
And I said, no, that's not going to work in a book, but it sure is going to work on a database or something that you can punch up.

46:51.045 --> 46:55.272
You can take Civil War and Statue and type it in here, and you'll get some interesting work out of it.

46:55.332 --> 47:01.361
Apparently this is going to document every gnome and every town and every interesting idea all over the United States.

47:01.762 --> 47:06.209
This is the power of that computer.

47:06.329 --> 47:07.471
I mean, it's going to change.

47:07.571 --> 47:08.993
I don't think it's going to change...

47:09.648 --> 47:14.934
the fact that books will continue to be published and loved and handled for all of the experience that those represent.

47:15.575 --> 47:18.158
But it may change the computers.

47:18.198 --> 47:23.444
This whole evolution that we're involved with could change the nature of what books are printed.

47:23.664 --> 47:34.657
And this still remains to be seen, but I can certainly see a lot of reference materials that are just going to be too efficient to be done in a book form.

47:35.759 --> 47:39.503
But more importantly, things that were never economically feasible

47:39.803 --> 47:44.271
in book form, now become completely feasible with technology.

47:44.852 --> 47:49.621
Let's say you have an interest in flight or trains that we talked about.

47:49.661 --> 48:03.887
You're going to be able, you know, once we've really started flushing out all of the byways of the Corbett Archive, you're going to be able to search and arrange and aggregate visual information on a

48:04.340 --> 48:07.283
against personal criteria that are of interest to you.

48:07.423 --> 48:10.346
It's like essentially publishing your own volume.

48:10.406 --> 48:11.467
That's right.

48:11.487 --> 48:14.510
This was demonstrated to me two days ago at Stanford by Keller.

48:15.331 --> 48:25.762
She said, now I'm going to just have this woman spend an hour with the Journal of Biological something or another to publish a monograph of a thousand copies and to buy this.

48:26.042 --> 48:28.144
And, of course, it's going to be outdated the day it's out anyway.

48:28.604 --> 48:31.107
It'll cost you $200 to buy a volume of it.

48:31.407 --> 48:32.788
Now it's available here.

48:32.888 --> 48:35.090
You know, you can punch up anything you want.

48:35.110 --> 48:36.191
The graphics are there.

48:36.211 --> 48:39.955
The illustrations in some cases are even better than you'd get in the book.

48:39.995 --> 48:41.176
You can do the zooming in.

48:41.196 --> 48:41.877
I mean, it's amazing.

48:42.297 --> 48:59.533
Well, you know, the interesting thing is it can really force us back to reevaluating it and gaining a new appreciation, maybe a reinvigorated appreciation of the book itself, you know, because a lot of the more referenced pieces are going to fall into the realm of new media.

48:59.553 --> 49:00.334
So I think that

49:00.955 --> 49:09.213
In many instances, a lot of this computer access to this kind of information could really even enhance, I think, book publishing.

49:09.353 --> 49:16.087
It'll really have publishers thinking more carefully about what kind of books can we publish that people will love.

49:16.127 --> 49:20.497
I was at the ABA in June in Chicago.

49:20.517 --> 49:21.158
I go every year.

49:21.695 --> 49:24.778
That's where we met, as a matter of fact.

49:25.179 --> 49:27.862
There was a whole level there just devoted to this stuff.

49:28.683 --> 49:30.124
We did some searches in the archive.

49:30.144 --> 49:32.747
We had the archive online.

49:33.949 --> 49:38.113
That's what kind of made him see where Corbis might fit into this project.

49:38.133 --> 49:40.436
Oh, it fits into this project.

49:40.917 --> 49:44.481
Do you have a CV on Charles and all the people I'll be talking to?

49:44.701 --> 49:44.901
I do.

49:45.387 --> 49:49.292
taking a CD-ROM and putting it on the internet doesn't make a very interesting web experience.

49:49.653 --> 49:53.097
You need to design to use the media to its best effect.

49:53.257 --> 49:55.080
And it will really be its own creature.

49:55.360 --> 49:56.321
Exactly.

49:56.401 --> 50:05.513
And so that's what we're kind of looking at with our new online team is what sorts of publishing online, what sorts of experiences online are interesting and compelling.

50:05.894 --> 50:09.098
And Curtis will talk to that, address himself for that.

50:09.118 --> 50:09.538
Absolutely.

50:10.199 --> 50:11.481
So this is the product development team.

50:11.501 --> 50:12.042
It smells new.

50:12.062 --> 50:14.685
We just punched down into these offices a few weeks ago.

50:15.121 --> 50:19.889
We're on the second floor.

50:20.890 --> 50:23.014
Laurie's talking again on this table.

50:23.074 --> 50:31.428
Each development team is comprised of a producer and a designer and a developer and assistants.

50:31.448 --> 50:37.598
And then we do occasionally contract out for some of the more sophisticated things like audio mixing or some of that sort of thing.

50:37.618 --> 50:39.441
But we do a lot of the work in-house.

50:39.860 --> 50:44.305
We partner with experts, subject experts, for instance, with Passion for Art.

50:44.365 --> 50:52.654
We worked with some of the leading art history experts, experts on Impressionist art in Critical Mass, which is our title on the atomic bomb.

50:52.675 --> 50:58.982
We worked with the Los Alamos facility and the head archivist there, as well as leading physicists and scientists from around the world.

50:59.402 --> 51:07.251
We really, again, in this attempt to develop context around the story and provide an enriching experience, we really want to work with the best

51:07.535 --> 51:10.879
And we know that we can't bring that level of research to it internally.

51:10.919 --> 51:13.682
We need to partner with people out in the field.

51:13.783 --> 51:17.467
We're working on a title right now on FDR that will be out in a few months.

51:17.487 --> 51:18.228
That was in the PW.

51:18.248 --> 51:25.577
Yeah, we've been working with Doris Kearns Goodwin, with Jeffrey Ward, who are some really noted experts in that field.

51:25.657 --> 51:29.902
And they're actually narrating parts of the CD and doing some of the essays.

51:29.922 --> 51:32.825
So that's kind of the caliber of people that we're trying to work with.

51:33.486 --> 51:36.189
And this team down here, a very creative group.

51:37.291 --> 51:37.491
Let's see.

51:37.657 --> 51:46.367
Again, not much to work out, lots of offices with the computers and lamps, but the work that goes on here is really, really outstanding.

51:46.786 --> 51:53.233
I don't know if I noted, I think I did, that all four of the existing titles have all been recognized with several awards.

51:53.253 --> 51:57.218
You mentioned that, and you were probably going to get me a listing of that.

51:57.238 --> 52:00.962
Passion for Art, the first title, I think has won just about every award that it could.

52:02.404 --> 52:09.652
Just amazing acclaim for these titles, which is great testimony to the talent of the scene.

52:09.752 --> 52:15.358
And when it started, was that the intent that at some point you would be...

52:15.524 --> 52:17.131
producing these CDs?

52:17.151 --> 52:24.662
Well, I mean, again, the original intent was, the charter was, okay, we think that someday digital content is going to be important.

52:24.923 --> 52:26.007
Go out and figure out

52:26.425 --> 52:26.946
figured out.

52:27.386 --> 52:39.501
So we were looking at all sorts of opportunities, everything from, you know, interactive television to CD-ROMs to internet to, you know, kiosks and, you know, what do you do with digital content?

52:39.622 --> 52:46.150
So several years were spent investigating all the options and going down many, many tracks as any R&D company will do.

52:47.331 --> 52:51.977
And it wasn't until, you know, maybe two years ago that we really kind of said, okay,

52:52.396 --> 52:54.558
You know, this has been great, but we could do R&D forever.

52:54.598 --> 52:55.459
It's real interesting.

52:55.519 --> 52:58.823
But let's figure out, you know, what are some businesses we can get our hands around?

52:59.624 --> 53:02.647
And what are some businesses that are currently using digital images?

53:03.288 --> 53:07.492
And two of the obvious ones were CD-ROM products and image licensing.

53:07.672 --> 53:09.975
And so those were the first two business groups we developed.

53:10.055 --> 53:11.516
But there will be others.

53:11.576 --> 53:14.459
And as these sorts of things come out and as new markets emerge.

53:14.479 --> 53:16.121
And they reveal themselves, I guess.

53:16.141 --> 53:16.562
Exactly.

53:16.642 --> 53:20.766
We'll be able to develop businesses that address those different markets.

53:22.214 --> 53:24.385
It looks like Curtis isn't in his office.

53:25.049 --> 53:26.657
Do you want to take a quick break?

53:26.677 --> 53:26.918
Sure.

53:27.039 --> 53:28.647
That would be good.
