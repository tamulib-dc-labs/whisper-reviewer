00:04.773 --> 00:05.775
He's a good writer, too.

00:06.856 --> 00:07.417
Very fun.

00:07.477 --> 00:08.298
He's a good writer.

00:08.659 --> 00:10.662
He's written some beautiful things.

00:10.682 --> 00:14.928
The book that he did on Logan, I think, is exceptionally good.

00:14.988 --> 00:23.561
Some things I can tell you, but I cannot tell you.

00:26.386 --> 00:31.894
I don't want you to do anything that this is going to be a very good-spirited book.

00:32.482 --> 00:38.288
I'm not out to embarrass anybody, but I want to tell some nice stories.

00:38.509 --> 00:44.315
I'm going to see Ed Wolfe.

00:44.435 --> 00:46.177
I spent some time with Steve Riley.

00:48.139 --> 00:50.802
I'm told I should talk to Rostenberg and Stern.

00:50.842 --> 00:54.306
They might have some interesting stories to tell.

00:54.326 --> 00:56.047
I'm going to go to the University of Texas.

00:56.067 --> 00:57.729
Do you know anything about Harry Ransom?

00:58.190 --> 01:02.134
Well, there's a lot to know about Harry Ransom, but...

01:03.211 --> 01:10.718
I haven't got enough material to give you the background.

01:10.738 --> 01:18.946
How about just off the record background, could you tell me how he was able to do such a marvelous... Something about his methods.

01:19.127 --> 01:26.173
His methods are quite interesting, aren't they?

01:26.193 --> 01:28.536
Well, let's talk about the other thing.

01:28.556 --> 01:29.877
You just think about that.

01:30.110 --> 01:30.751
Cheers.

01:30.771 --> 01:31.993
Here's a happy new year.

01:32.033 --> 01:32.915
Thank you very much.

01:32.955 --> 01:34.658
God bless you and your children.

01:34.678 --> 01:35.339
Thank you.

01:35.359 --> 01:36.361
God bless you and your family.

01:40.688 --> 01:46.498
I'll shut this off in a moment.

01:46.748 --> 01:58.669
400 letters of Dickens to Mrs. Koops, Farron's Koops, which I paid, I don't know, $7,000, $8,000, $9,000 for the Morgan Library.

01:58.769 --> 02:01.494
I bought for the Morgan Library.

02:01.534 --> 02:02.856
This is an object?

02:02.916 --> 02:06.883
This was a Pachmanay Gallery.

02:06.903 --> 02:10.630
Well, Barrett kept out five or six.

02:10.812 --> 02:15.560
And then he put them into a later sale recently in the last year.

02:16.962 --> 02:20.948
And the five or six letters that he sold brought more than the 400.

02:20.968 --> 02:28.500
The five letters that he sold brought more

02:29.662 --> 02:31.464
And this is why we couldn't sell before.

02:31.484 --> 02:32.745
No, he didn't want, he wanted to.

02:32.765 --> 02:33.365
Oh, he couldn't.

02:33.385 --> 02:34.226
No, Roger.

02:34.246 --> 02:35.387
So he kept the best way.

02:35.407 --> 02:36.588
Roger's a good friend of mine.

02:36.608 --> 02:37.249
He's a lawyer.

02:37.269 --> 02:38.550
I know him very well.

02:38.911 --> 02:41.313
Know the whole family.

02:41.853 --> 02:50.421
And he thought he'd keep them, but he decided to sell them, so he sent them over to the gallery.

02:50.601 --> 02:56.867
What do you feel when you pick up, like, a...

02:57.151 --> 03:22.534
do you feel anything when you're holding something like that no i don't feel anything it's become become a commercial thing like uh like like this guy's a waiter like you're a writer like you're a house house you're a social worker social worker oh that's good social workers good we need a lot of

03:22.987 --> 03:52.757
we need more social workers than booksellers and anything she's good she's such a compassionate woman you know it's more than nothing anything else the hell with anything else did you see the times this morning that the state of connecticut is going to buy condos now yes yes crazy times people used to say condos were the future that's right

03:52.990 --> 04:09.077
You told me that there has not been a great collection, any book at all, written about Robert Fulton in 60 years.

04:09.357 --> 04:15.488
And I said, naively, there has to be more to him than the steamboat.

04:15.868 --> 04:16.990
And then you said...

04:17.527 --> 04:19.149
You said, bear that in mind.

04:20.430 --> 04:27.518
Diplomatically and scientifically, he was one of the greats.

04:28.399 --> 04:31.462
And you know this because you said he built the great collection.

04:31.482 --> 04:34.926
I built one of the great collections.

04:34.946 --> 04:36.148
So you know what the name is.

04:36.168 --> 04:36.628
So I know.

04:37.469 --> 04:38.490
Right.

04:38.510 --> 04:41.013
That's the point, because you built the collection.

04:41.033 --> 04:45.018
And if I were a younger man, I would write it.

04:45.138 --> 04:47.280
I would begin to write a life of reference.

04:49.893 --> 04:52.436
What about him impressed you?

04:52.456 --> 04:52.896
Who?

04:53.757 --> 04:57.962
So you were basically a bookman, and you were building a collection.

04:58.643 --> 04:59.964
You built hundreds of collections.

05:01.005 --> 05:08.233
What was there about Robert Fulton that particularly intrigued you, is the word I was looking for.

05:08.373 --> 05:10.375
Well, he intrigued me.

05:10.395 --> 05:17.503
His versatility, his knowledge, and government, and science.

05:18.158 --> 05:21.021
Who did you build the collection for?

05:23.763 --> 05:25.364
An individual or an institution?

05:25.445 --> 05:26.085
Individual.

05:27.987 --> 05:30.829
And it is still an individual collection?

05:30.849 --> 05:31.930
Or is it now an institution?

05:31.950 --> 05:32.811
It's in a museum.

05:34.232 --> 05:35.253
So you can tell me that, right?

05:35.313 --> 05:39.497
It's at the New York Historical Society.

05:39.517 --> 05:40.638
I've managed to go there.

05:40.798 --> 05:46.123
I've managed to see it go there.

05:47.133 --> 05:49.656
Yeah.

05:49.737 --> 05:50.578
It was quite enough.

05:50.798 --> 05:53.021
You mean oil paintings or sketches?

05:53.041 --> 05:54.483
Yeah, yeah.

05:54.503 --> 05:59.009
Well, anyone who could design a steamboat as more than an inventor.

05:59.370 --> 06:03.235
Oh.

06:03.255 --> 06:13.248
But his science and his diplomacy with Jefferson and these men, they were mad at him.

06:13.268 --> 06:15.992
I mean, corresponded to him.

06:16.478 --> 06:38.318
well if you were a collector if i was if i were you i did everything up and i'd write a life of books really yeah i think i think it could be a that's the next book maybe maybe that's book number two

06:38.922 --> 06:42.768
This is book number one, because I'm under contract for this one.

06:43.129 --> 06:44.471
I don't care.

06:44.531 --> 06:47.876
I'm teasing, but I'm sorry.

06:48.076 --> 06:52.723
You're telling me something based on years of knowledge and insight.

06:52.743 --> 06:56.910
It's never been in my knowledge.

06:57.150 --> 06:58.332
And of course you'll find

06:58.548 --> 07:10.871
material all over the country, which basically was one of the founders of the New York Historic Society.

07:10.951 --> 07:21.872
And the material there is just...

07:22.696 --> 07:26.481
Well, you know, you forget.

07:26.521 --> 07:30.286
I had a friend.

07:30.306 --> 07:33.470
He invented the steamboat.

07:33.570 --> 07:44.205
But that kind of recedes in memory, doesn't it?

07:44.225 --> 07:45.987
And people forget who this guy was.

07:46.591 --> 07:52.038
So clearly he was much more than a man who invented the means of transportation.

07:52.258 --> 07:54.741
He changed the way that people traveled for centuries.

07:55.402 --> 07:57.024
That's your answer.

08:00.949 --> 08:14.826
It's stuck in my brain, you know, and I said closer.

08:15.093 --> 08:19.343
A visionary man, and I looked around and said, Brent was the last.

08:19.423 --> 08:30.069
Now what you're saying is that a collector came to you and said, I'm interested in Robert Fulton.

08:30.249 --> 08:32.595
And so fine.

08:32.845 --> 08:36.676
being a professional book dealer, you said, I'll do what I can.

08:36.776 --> 08:40.407
And you acquired extraordinary things, obviously.

08:40.567 --> 08:48.289
And in the process of doing this, it dawned on you that there's a possibility for books.

08:48.792 --> 08:53.940
Based on the archival material that you put together?

08:53.960 --> 08:56.964
Not only on the material that's available.

08:58.627 --> 09:00.029
Why is it untapped?

09:00.109 --> 09:00.610
I don't know.

09:01.191 --> 09:05.157
That's one question I cannot answer.

09:05.197 --> 09:08.522
That's why the collector is important.

09:08.542 --> 09:10.585
This is one of the theses that I have.

09:10.885 --> 09:12.928
This is what the collector does.

09:13.109 --> 09:16.774
People like yourself who assist the collector and build the collector.

09:16.754 --> 09:28.230
is that you produce a body of work that can then be used to create an important work, either a history, a work of art, a work of documentation, whatever.

09:28.951 --> 09:31.114
I think that's an example of what he's saying.

09:31.134 --> 09:32.516
And that's the one that hasn't been done yet.

09:32.536 --> 09:34.038
That's the best part of it.

09:34.059 --> 09:36.762
That's what makes it point to me.

09:36.782 --> 09:45.715
I think that man was so crazy, you know, and so little written about it.

09:45.695 --> 09:47.037
Did he have an interesting life?

09:47.397 --> 09:47.657
Very.

09:48.238 --> 09:51.101
I mean, personally, not just creatively.

09:51.302 --> 09:55.206
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

09:55.266 --> 10:02.815
Love affairs, scandals, septal interest, that would go beyond a scholarly readership.

10:03.696 --> 10:07.821
No, I think it's more scholarly than...

10:07.801 --> 10:30.703
well obviously i'm literary because if i weren't i wouldn't be doing this book you know dave david mccullough did a book about the panama you know david mccullough wrote the book about the brooklyn bridge oh yeah yeah he took subjects that nobody

10:30.683 --> 10:32.666
Well, Robles, I knew very well.

10:32.907 --> 10:38.757
You knew Robles?

10:38.897 --> 10:41.542
Of course.

10:41.562 --> 10:49.175
Who made the best collectors?

10:49.315 --> 10:50.397
Doctors, lawyers?

10:50.377 --> 10:52.142
You never can tell.

10:52.202 --> 10:52.944
Businessmen?

10:52.964 --> 10:53.586
Businessmen.

10:54.107 --> 10:57.556
They have come out of the woodworks.

10:57.597 --> 10:58.900
They come out of the woodworks.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.209
He told me, he said, at the closure club, they really want to have...

11:02.712 --> 11:11.043
Business, they want Wall Street types on the board because they get things done.

11:11.323 --> 11:14.247
But that's what I would do.

11:14.667 --> 11:15.368
Bear that in mind.

11:16.430 --> 11:17.211
No, he'd like to do it.

11:17.231 --> 11:19.253
Do I bear it in mind?

11:19.313 --> 11:21.416
I've talked to him.

11:21.436 --> 11:23.038
The piano guy now, right?

11:23.078 --> 11:25.261
What kind of a collection did he have?

11:25.281 --> 11:26.863
You mean his own stuff?

11:27.248 --> 11:36.841
The sons of the original... But his own documents about the making of the... It wasn't a book collection, for se, it was a documentary collection.

11:36.901 --> 11:42.589
That's how I go on from one to another, you see.

11:43.911 --> 11:49.999
I think of these things, you know... As I just mentioned, I've got the machinery again.

11:49.979 --> 11:57.751
You probably told me today about five different collections that you sent away of the New York Historical Society.

11:57.811 --> 11:59.514
And you said, why send it out there?

11:59.594 --> 12:03.961
Give it to Landauer with one Steinway.

12:04.021 --> 12:08.949
You mentioned something about tickets or something like that.

12:09.029 --> 12:11.113
Oh yeah, the Landauer collection.

12:11.153 --> 12:13.236
That's right.

12:13.216 --> 12:13.997
It's all there.

12:14.498 --> 12:16.101
You love this city then, don't you?

12:16.121 --> 12:16.863
Well, listen.

12:16.883 --> 12:19.808
You send a lot of things to a historical place.

12:19.828 --> 12:26.500
Yeah, I sent a lot of stuff to Boston, to Brandeis.

12:26.520 --> 12:29.545
When they started original, I sent them a lot of stuff.

12:29.826 --> 12:32.170
I sent them, they gave them a building.

12:32.690 --> 12:38.636
gave him $250,000 to put up a building at Brandeis called the American Civilization Building.

12:40.758 --> 12:49.166
But of course, the guy gave him the money, $250,000, and his name was on it, but he didn't give him any money to do it.

12:49.206 --> 12:50.147
Isn't that amazing?

12:51.107 --> 12:52.309
Usually it's the other way around.

12:52.349 --> 12:55.972
They give the collection, but they don't give him any money to maintain it.

12:56.052 --> 12:57.854
It's the other way around, usually.

12:57.994 --> 13:02.258
You know, they give this wonderful collection, but then they say, how come we afford to keep it?

13:02.491 --> 13:14.440
And that's probably why they had to sell the, if Rosenwald had given them enough money to keep that document, you know, that's, again, now that's a very interesting, I hadn't thought of that.

13:14.460 --> 13:19.572
See, when John Carter Brown, when their family set up the library at Brown,

13:20.176 --> 13:24.984
Well, they not only built the building, but they gave a half a million dollars, which 80 years ago is a lot of money.

13:26.085 --> 13:29.691
So therefore, they've got a beautiful library there that's able to maintain itself.

13:29.971 --> 13:31.334
When J.P.

13:31.394 --> 13:34.819
Morgan set up the library, he gave money to maintain it.

13:35.440 --> 13:36.622
That's why it's able to go.

13:36.662 --> 13:37.784
That's why it's able to go.

13:37.824 --> 13:40.408
I think your point is extremely well made.

13:40.428 --> 13:42.431
You have to do both.

13:42.471 --> 13:44.434
This guy gives the building, but nothing to put in it.

13:45.316 --> 13:48.040
So you had to get the collection to put in it.

13:48.020 --> 13:50.945
Otherwise, what's the good of the collection?

13:50.965 --> 13:51.867
There's no collection.

13:52.027 --> 13:53.349
There's no collection.

13:53.369 --> 13:54.731
You get my point.

13:54.791 --> 13:56.134
You get it together.

13:56.194 --> 13:57.817
So where did you get the stuff to put in it?

13:57.917 --> 13:59.980
I didn't get it.

14:00.120 --> 14:03.406
It turned into something else.

14:03.747 --> 14:04.187
He died.

14:04.227 --> 14:05.269
The guy died.

14:05.289 --> 14:07.293
And that was the end of it.

14:08.254 --> 14:09.336
The building was there.

14:09.518 --> 14:26.008
and uh and so what went into it we have to heat the building we have to clean the building and there's nothing in it so what finally went in i don't know they put something

14:27.338 --> 14:29.260
Why would he do it that way?

14:29.380 --> 14:30.842
I guess he wanted to do something.

14:30.922 --> 14:31.662
It was a gesture.

14:31.682 --> 14:33.284
It's like giving money to the church.

14:33.304 --> 14:34.926
Can I tell you what's in the guy's mind?

14:35.066 --> 14:35.987
I'm not that smart.

14:36.067 --> 14:38.249
I'm not a mind reader.

14:38.369 --> 14:39.731
I can't.

14:39.751 --> 14:43.174
You know, look at his name on the boobie.

14:43.935 --> 14:44.916
Well, Harry Whitener.

14:44.956 --> 14:48.560
Did you know the Whitener family, by the way?

14:48.640 --> 14:50.522
Now, he went down to the Titanic.

14:50.642 --> 14:51.603
Yeah, that's right.

14:51.703 --> 14:54.426
And then he had a nice, modest little collection.

14:54.760 --> 14:57.524
If you listen to people, he was one of the greatest collectors.

14:57.704 --> 14:58.465
He wasn't.

14:58.485 --> 15:00.488
He was a young man.

15:00.508 --> 15:04.715
But his mother hired Rosenbach to put together a great collection.

15:04.975 --> 15:10.623
But what she did is she built this wonderful library named the Canary Widener Library.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.847
Which is a great institution.

15:12.867 --> 15:15.250
Which is an extraordinary institution.

15:16.208 --> 15:19.518
And she also had Rosenbach to buy a few more books.

15:19.539 --> 15:21.425
Well, that helps, you know.

15:24.936 --> 15:26.320
That's a pretty good story, isn't it?

15:26.705 --> 15:29.570
You don't mind if I'm telling the truth about you.

15:29.590 --> 15:30.371
I love it.

15:30.431 --> 15:31.353
This is what I want to do.

15:31.373 --> 15:32.174
Did you know Newton?

15:32.755 --> 15:34.037
I knew him very well.

15:34.117 --> 15:35.920
I knew his son even better.

15:35.940 --> 15:37.202
You knew everybody.

15:37.222 --> 15:43.312
Shukti, I knew very well, but I knew everybody who's involved in books and it's very interesting.

15:43.332 --> 15:47.719
Of course, I've lived all through it.

15:47.760 --> 15:49.322
Tell me, do we repeat this?

15:49.342 --> 15:52.948
My daughter-in-law published a...

15:52.928 --> 15:58.828
A book of, she wrote a book of, illustrated a book on Joyce.

15:58.848 --> 16:00.273
Sells now for $10,000.

16:00.393 --> 16:02.561
Your daughter-in-law did this?

16:02.581 --> 16:04.146
Yeah.

16:04.588 --> 16:05.571
Susan Wilde.

16:06.462 --> 16:07.764
Susan Wilde?

16:07.984 --> 16:11.449
Susan Wilde, yes.

16:11.949 --> 16:16.756
She illustrated this big illustrated thing.

16:17.096 --> 16:18.778
There must be a limited edition of it.

16:18.798 --> 16:21.241
It is, yes, to 50 copies and all sold.

16:21.782 --> 16:23.204
It now sells for $10,000.

16:23.685 --> 16:23.985
Wow.

16:24.185 --> 16:25.567
I bought the first one.

16:26.468 --> 16:27.269
I paid them $2,500.

16:27.670 --> 16:31.695
Now it's, I don't want it.

16:31.715 --> 16:32.696
I still have it.

16:32.716 --> 16:34.279
Would you like some coffee?

16:34.339 --> 16:35.440
Yes.

16:35.960 --> 16:41.388
It should be a little bit of coffee.

16:41.448 --> 16:42.771
Regular coffee.

16:43.171 --> 16:47.718
Maybe some dessert to someone first.

16:47.919 --> 16:50.563
No, I want to go back.

16:50.743 --> 16:53.728
I'm not eating pizza.

16:53.748 --> 16:54.849
Coffee also?

16:55.691 --> 16:56.652
Coffee first.

16:56.632 --> 16:59.739
What do you remember about Newton?

16:59.760 --> 17:03.308
Was he a... Well, he was a very interesting character.

17:03.328 --> 17:06.456
Swifty I knew much better, of course.

17:09.102 --> 17:10.405
But he was a...

17:11.296 --> 17:13.440
He's an interesting man.

17:13.501 --> 17:14.302
Who's Swifty?

17:14.322 --> 17:16.046
Swifty was... His son.

17:16.066 --> 17:19.794
His son, okay.

17:20.335 --> 17:24.343
He's the last guy to write really best-selling books about book watching.

17:24.363 --> 17:27.550
Yeah, well, he wrote those books, you know.

17:28.120 --> 17:31.164
They were basically stories in the Atlantic Mercury, I guess.

17:31.344 --> 17:35.889
Right, right, right, right.

17:36.029 --> 17:38.632
With a little bit of luck, I'll write something like that.

17:38.793 --> 17:40.955
With a little bit of luck, I'll write something like that.

17:40.975 --> 17:44.880
Well, there's a feel for it.

17:45.621 --> 17:49.365
People are eager for anecdotes, you know.

17:49.385 --> 17:50.246
Well, that's what I'm doing.

17:51.808 --> 17:52.509
But with a purpose.

17:52.529 --> 17:54.070
There's a purpose, too.

17:54.311 --> 17:57.234
I mean, there's a purpose to what I'm writing about.

17:57.254 --> 17:57.975
You know this guy, Broccoli?

17:58.478 --> 18:00.537
Matthew Buckley.

18:00.557 --> 18:02.272
I have his private phone number.

18:02.293 --> 18:03.342
I haven't called him.

18:03.710 --> 18:09.238
He's the guy we ran into at the restaurant in Washington, D.C., at the 88, at Galileo's restaurant.

18:09.258 --> 18:10.840
Look at that guy with a short crew cut.

18:10.860 --> 18:11.361
Yeah.

18:11.381 --> 18:15.827
He's the biographer of Scott Fitzgerald, and he has a Hemingway thing.

18:15.987 --> 18:16.829
Well, he writes them.

18:17.029 --> 18:17.970
He writes them overnight.

18:18.090 --> 18:20.173
He writes a bibliography overnight.

18:20.193 --> 18:20.394
Yeah.

18:20.594 --> 18:24.339
He did the biography of Mitchell Kennelly, which I thought was... I thought it stunk.

18:24.620 --> 18:25.401
Oh, it didn't sell.

18:25.461 --> 18:26.002
It was much.

18:26.022 --> 18:27.404
It was terribly written.

18:27.624 --> 18:31.810
I knew Mitchell Kennelly as well as I know my own children.

18:32.684 --> 18:34.687
Did he capture Mitchell Kendall?

18:34.707 --> 18:37.390
No, he didn't know what the hell he was talking about.

18:37.410 --> 18:38.551
Where did he miss it?

18:38.572 --> 18:39.493
He missed it all over.

18:41.235 --> 18:42.957
He came up to see me and I told him.

18:42.977 --> 18:43.838
So Buckley did.

18:44.339 --> 18:45.440
Buckley did?

18:46.021 --> 18:49.846
Well, Mitchell Kendall, I saw him die.

18:50.667 --> 18:52.009
He owed me $2,000.

18:53.511 --> 18:55.113
Committed suicide, you know.

18:55.153 --> 18:56.815
He was quite a character.

18:56.835 --> 18:58.277
He was a wonderful human being.

18:58.477 --> 19:00.139
He had the Anderson Galleries, right?

19:00.359 --> 19:00.600
Right.

19:00.620 --> 19:02.522
He was the head of the Anderson Galleries.

19:03.582 --> 19:10.291
And he is a story about wine, women, and so on.

19:10.311 --> 19:16.920
With him, it was wine and women.

19:16.940 --> 19:17.821
Never mind the song.

19:17.942 --> 19:20.405
I'm sorry.

19:20.445 --> 19:20.906
I'm sorry.

19:21.046 --> 19:24.230
It could be so.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.333
What do you remember about that?

19:26.617 --> 19:27.919
Bob Dick Kenwood?

19:27.939 --> 19:29.601
Richard Kenwood?

19:29.621 --> 19:30.562
I do him very well.

19:30.622 --> 19:34.046
I do him intimately well.

19:34.066 --> 19:35.047
Intimately well.

19:35.127 --> 19:36.349
Did he know his stuff?

19:36.369 --> 19:37.290
Did he?

19:37.310 --> 19:37.510
Yes.

19:37.550 --> 19:49.384
He had, I'm telling you, a couple words that... Too much women and too much...

19:49.550 --> 19:51.955
He enjoyed his life.

19:56.265 --> 19:58.911
You were going to tell me something about John Quick.

19:59.854 --> 20:01.738
Well, he was a lawyer in New York.

20:01.758 --> 20:06.208
Yeah, but he is really responsible for supporting writers.

20:06.188 --> 20:11.694
And collecting writers like Joseph Conrad and Joyce and V.H.

20:11.874 --> 20:12.374
Lawrence.

20:12.414 --> 20:12.915
That's right.

20:12.995 --> 20:13.996
That was his field.

20:14.156 --> 20:20.042
And they say he's responsible for making the collecting of modern, of contemporaries fashionable.

20:20.803 --> 20:22.385
And I guess that's why I'm interested.

20:22.445 --> 20:27.049
In a way, in a way you could, yes, in a way you could, yes.

20:29.512 --> 20:34.457
But you said he was kind of... Well, he was out to make a buck.

20:34.876 --> 20:35.337
Really?

20:35.377 --> 20:36.778
That's not the impression you get.

20:37.279 --> 20:39.722
The impression I get is that he was a patron.

20:39.822 --> 20:44.989
He supported these people.

20:45.209 --> 20:47.712
That's not true.

20:49.695 --> 20:52.678
You're breaking all these legendary views.

20:52.839 --> 20:59.467
I don't care what I... Basically, there's no sense to it.

21:02.951 --> 21:04.393
Well, you think that when he...

21:04.694 --> 21:10.162
Of course they say that he would give money to Grace and to Pound and to all these others.

21:11.123 --> 21:12.164
But he always got stuff.

21:12.224 --> 21:14.247
But he always got stuff in return.

21:14.347 --> 21:15.910
He got manuscripts and stuff.

21:15.930 --> 21:16.530
He got manuscripts.

21:16.551 --> 21:17.392
He got paintings.

21:17.412 --> 21:18.053
He got drawings.

21:18.133 --> 21:20.656
He had everything.

21:20.676 --> 21:22.238
That's the kicker, isn't it?

21:22.258 --> 21:24.522
It wasn't just support.

21:25.443 --> 21:29.489
He was buying stuff at bargain basement prices is what he was doing.

21:29.509 --> 21:30.210
And he knew it.

21:30.230 --> 21:31.531
At least he had the taste to know it.

21:31.672 --> 21:32.693
He had the taste to know it.

21:33.331 --> 21:38.338
That's interesting, though.

21:38.759 --> 21:46.230
And Mitchell Kennelly did a great thing by putting out the Quinn catalog.

21:46.250 --> 21:47.212
I have it.

21:47.232 --> 21:48.253
I have it.

21:48.634 --> 21:49.956
Two volumes in the blackboard.

21:49.976 --> 21:50.416
Wonderful.

21:51.738 --> 21:53.661
Joseph Conrad is the pointy's piece.

21:54.002 --> 21:54.162
Oh.

21:54.182 --> 21:54.242
Oh.

21:55.015 --> 22:02.165
You'd think that somebody dead, a great whiter, but he had somebody alive, which is very unusual.

22:02.185 --> 22:03.446
That hadn't happened before.

22:03.947 --> 22:06.350
Did you ever have any dealings with Weiss, Thomas J. Weiss?

22:07.632 --> 22:09.455
No.

22:09.475 --> 22:09.535
No.

22:09.555 --> 22:10.576
He was in London.

22:10.596 --> 22:12.198
Yeah, but he dealt with Americans.

22:12.559 --> 22:14.281
Well... But he really wasn't a dealer.

22:14.301 --> 22:15.303
He really wasn't.

22:15.363 --> 22:16.785
He was a faker.

22:16.825 --> 22:17.946
He was the great forger.

22:18.026 --> 22:18.927
He was the great forger.

22:20.169 --> 22:22.272
And yet...

22:22.522 --> 22:24.869
You know, he put together one of the greatest libraries.

22:25.391 --> 22:28.279
I mean, it's the actually library.

22:28.299 --> 22:29.162
How can you figure that?

22:29.222 --> 22:30.807
What gets into people's minds?

22:30.827 --> 22:33.094
What gets into people's minds?

22:33.475 --> 22:36.223
Did you ever get suckered by any forgeries?

22:36.243 --> 22:37.206
Listen, no.

22:37.422 --> 23:01.438
listen i'm not a psychiatrist i can only answer questions from from the bread and butter line you know other than that i have no i i don't profess to be it i lived a long time and i lived among these people and i i began to know them you know and they knew me and which is one of the best

23:01.739 --> 23:03.402
I asked Mitchell Kenley one day.

23:03.422 --> 23:04.283
He used to come in.

23:04.303 --> 23:05.685
I saw him every day, every day.

23:05.765 --> 23:06.847
Every day.

23:07.167 --> 23:09.852
He is.

23:10.012 --> 23:15.460
He asked him one day.

23:15.480 --> 23:23.072
One day, I said to him, Mitchell, I said, who do you think?

23:23.170 --> 23:30.597
is one of the greatest upcoming booksellers in America.

23:32.238 --> 23:36.462
At that time, I didn't know what his answer was.

23:36.502 --> 23:37.924
He said, Bonnie Byer.

23:38.304 --> 23:41.047
You never heard this name.

23:41.067 --> 23:45.231
I knew Bonnie Byer very well.

23:45.271 --> 23:45.891
P-Y-E-I?

23:46.732 --> 23:47.613
P-Y.

23:47.633 --> 23:50.055
And I knew him.

23:50.440 --> 23:58.271
He was a great buyer in the famous sale.

23:58.552 --> 24:00.835
Not the Quinn, but the other one.

24:00.995 --> 24:01.436
Bishop.

24:02.297 --> 24:03.278
Not the Bishop.

24:03.298 --> 24:07.304
The musical writer.

24:07.324 --> 24:07.985
Jerome Currie.

24:08.145 --> 24:09.547
Jerome Currie, a great buyer.

24:09.848 --> 24:17.238
And I was surprised that he told me.

24:17.318 --> 24:17.899
You know, I was

24:18.166 --> 24:21.530
I just asked a question, and I was surprised that he didn't.

24:21.550 --> 24:28.739
Of course, there was Gabriel Wells, who was knowledgeable.

24:31.122 --> 24:33.865
So was that a significant answer when he said Barney Byer?

24:33.985 --> 24:38.831
Well, it was, to me, it was more than a significant answer.

24:38.851 --> 24:42.756
To me, it led me to a new line of

24:42.888 --> 24:44.150
people, you see.

24:44.170 --> 24:45.331
I knew Bonnie Byer.

24:45.351 --> 24:46.773
So was he right on that, by the way?

24:47.434 --> 24:48.175
Was he on the money?

24:48.395 --> 24:49.677
Well, he died very young.

24:49.857 --> 24:52.881
But I mean, was Kennelly on the money with that assessment?

24:52.901 --> 24:54.543
Yes.

24:54.563 --> 24:56.906
So he was very perspicacious then, he was very astute.

24:56.926 --> 24:57.467
That's right.

24:59.129 --> 25:00.651
That's right.

25:00.671 --> 25:02.093
But he impressed you then?

25:02.514 --> 25:08.001
He impressed me with that remark, because I didn't think of Bonnie Byer being the

25:08.538 --> 25:10.541
I was wrong.

25:10.641 --> 25:12.865
Listen, have you ever been wrong in your life?

25:13.045 --> 25:14.167
Many times.

25:14.388 --> 25:19.696
But I admit I was wrong, you know.

25:20.998 --> 25:24.224
Did your wife take part of your interest in books?

25:24.584 --> 25:24.685
No.

25:24.705 --> 25:28.411
She was a house driver.

25:28.571 --> 25:31.556
She was very happy with her children and with her grandchildren.

25:32.297 --> 25:33.499
And she loved the farm.

25:34.964 --> 25:37.187
You should love table clothes.

25:37.327 --> 25:40.631
What does it do with all the vegetables?

25:40.751 --> 25:44.275
Do you sell them and give them to the back?

25:44.295 --> 25:45.657
No, I give them away.

25:45.677 --> 25:52.385
I mean, I just go out in the summertime and pick the corn and take it in and eat it right.

25:52.846 --> 25:53.947
You love that out there, huh?

25:53.967 --> 25:55.850
Your own garlic?

25:55.870 --> 25:57.932
Yes, I love my garlic, my own onion.

25:58.633 --> 25:59.254
How about the kids?

25:59.274 --> 26:00.175
Horseradish.

26:00.255 --> 26:01.917
I do my own horseradish.

26:02.487 --> 26:04.570
I grew everything, every damn thing.

26:04.590 --> 26:06.613
Did the kids enjoy it out at the park?

26:06.633 --> 26:08.375
Oh, yeah, they enjoyed it.

26:08.435 --> 26:10.478
They enjoyed it.

26:10.518 --> 26:18.469
They used to come home, big bags of zucchini and cucumbers and tomatoes.

26:18.489 --> 26:23.135
When fall came around, did you kind of look forward to returning to the bustle of the big city, though?

26:23.175 --> 26:25.358
That's right, yes.

26:25.438 --> 26:26.960
New Yorker all the way, right?

26:26.980 --> 26:30.705
Yes, New Yorker all the way.

26:31.006 --> 26:36.521
You know, we've had a wonderful session.

26:36.762 --> 26:38.266
I've had three and a half hours with you.

26:38.286 --> 26:41.474
I can't believe that it's turned so quickly.

26:41.675 --> 26:42.998
It's like a dream.

26:43.099 --> 26:45.305
I didn't know if you'd have an opportunity to meet you.

26:45.325 --> 26:47.310
I can't, I can't, and I'd like to,

26:47.628 --> 26:48.470
see you again.

26:48.490 --> 26:53.179
Well, when you come, please bring your wife and I'll take you to a restaurant.

26:53.239 --> 26:54.822
I will take you to a restaurant.

26:54.842 --> 26:56.285
No, no, no, no, no.

26:56.345 --> 26:57.587
But you'd like me to bring my wife?

26:57.647 --> 26:59.030
Yeah, bring your wife.

26:59.050 --> 26:59.771
This is a retreat from me.

26:59.791 --> 27:02.677
I'm usually going with the girls about working on my project.

27:02.697 --> 27:04.801
Come, come, come.

27:04.821 --> 27:05.182
Thank you.

27:05.202 --> 27:06.524
I'm going to shut this off.

27:07.947 --> 27:09.450
I think it's... The thing is...

27:09.768 --> 27:14.613
I just said again, I shut off, but not only have you experienced it all, but you appreciate it.

27:15.634 --> 27:16.335
You savored it.

27:19.098 --> 27:27.207
And I guess to put it all into perspective, have people, have collectors, book lovers changed it all over the last 75 years of your experience?

27:29.169 --> 27:30.370
Are we still pretty much the same?

27:31.031 --> 27:35.556
What should I say?

27:35.992 --> 27:43.889
They became more sophisticated, you know what I mean?

27:44.250 --> 27:54.692
More of the sophistication of ideas and what field they want to go in.

27:54.672 --> 27:56.634
Or more focused, to go back to that word.

27:56.714 --> 27:57.355
More focused.

27:57.375 --> 28:03.602
Well, I don't think you can put together the kind of great library today that Henry Huntington's collection.

28:03.622 --> 28:04.383
I mean, you can't go out.

28:04.403 --> 28:05.184
No, you can't.

28:05.464 --> 28:06.565
Well, you could.

28:06.585 --> 28:12.412
You never can say you can't, because there are always things coming up as a surprise.

28:12.632 --> 28:17.878
In the Martin collection.

28:18.314 --> 28:22.964
There's a great chance for somebody to start some great collection.

28:23.185 --> 28:27.956
Assuming you've got $50 million or something.

28:28.297 --> 28:29.860
We assume that, right?

28:30.194 --> 28:31.116
There you go.

28:31.136 --> 28:32.559
That's a chance.

28:32.579 --> 28:35.285
You can buy some top plate things, you know.

28:35.665 --> 28:40.796
Well, as David Redden said to me, he said, you know, I see paintings go for 20, 30.

28:40.816 --> 28:42.520
David Redden is a child, you know.

28:42.540 --> 28:43.321
I know David.

28:43.362 --> 28:44.785
He's still a boy.

28:44.825 --> 28:48.372
Yeah, but he said, I see paintings go for 30 and 40 million dollars.

28:48.706 --> 28:52.773
He said, you could buy a wonderful library, everything, for 10 or 15 million, and he's right.

28:53.114 --> 28:57.261
You know, if you've got the money, assuming you've got the money, you can have a world class.

28:57.281 --> 29:00.506
I had a customer in Chicago, and he called me up one day.

29:00.526 --> 29:01.508
He was in London.

29:02.850 --> 29:06.877
And he said, this will give you one picture of an idea.

29:08.320 --> 29:12.587
He was in London, and he said, look, it's my wife's birthday, and I want to buy it something.

29:12.989 --> 29:15.872
Will you look around and see what you can find?

29:17.573 --> 29:19.395
That's the type of trust people.

29:19.455 --> 29:23.940
How do I know what you would mean?

29:23.980 --> 29:25.041
Your husband would call me.

29:25.061 --> 29:27.283
How would I know what you would mean?

29:27.703 --> 29:38.254
So I looked around and I said, I went up to the gallery, and I saw a painting of Mary Cassette.

29:38.814 --> 29:39.995
By Mary Cassette?

29:40.015 --> 29:42.658
Yeah, but it was a very interesting group.

29:43.212 --> 29:50.982
a woman and child, and I have a love for children anyway, young children.

29:51.002 --> 30:02.417
And I looked at it, and I said to Leslie, who was the head of the life, I said, what do you think of that?

30:02.698 --> 30:05.401
He said, well, it's a great picture.

30:06.723 --> 30:08.165
I said, what do you think it'll go for?

30:08.185 --> 30:12.190
He said, I think it'll go for about $30,000 or $40,000.

30:12.507 --> 30:14.373
That's amazing.

30:14.393 --> 30:24.728
So I called them up in London and I said, listen, I found a very interesting painting I think you'll like.

30:25.079 --> 30:27.923
It's going to go for around $35,000.

30:27.963 --> 30:29.686
She said, go ahead and buy it.

30:29.706 --> 30:30.266
Just like that.

30:30.627 --> 30:35.534
Over the phone.

30:35.594 --> 30:37.176
For sure.

30:37.677 --> 30:41.242
So I bought it for $30,000.

30:41.462 --> 30:43.565
I sent it out to Chicago.

30:44.286 --> 30:48.112
A couple of weeks, he came back.

30:49.294 --> 30:51.677
And it was sold here two months ago.

30:52.315 --> 30:54.259
She put it up at auction.

30:54.279 --> 30:55.962
Can I guess?

30:55.982 --> 30:56.844
Can I guess?

30:56.904 --> 30:57.405
About one million.

30:57.485 --> 31:00.310
I was going to say a million and a half.

31:00.390 --> 31:01.653
One million.

31:01.733 --> 31:04.919
About one million bucks.

31:04.959 --> 31:07.023
America said it was, you know, I don't know.

31:07.043 --> 31:12.433
So, I mean, you know, I can tell you stories like that, but what does it mean?

31:12.700 --> 31:18.227
I'm not an art expert, but the picture appealed to me.

31:18.267 --> 31:20.390
She's so wonderful, like I said.

31:20.570 --> 31:23.554
She's an American who actually is a French Impressionist.

31:24.395 --> 31:32.245
Right, but I like the way this child with the mother, you know, and to me it had a feeling, you see.

31:32.225 --> 31:35.749
If I was somebody else, I think, you'd buy a race car.

31:35.789 --> 31:37.011
Was it a large picture?

31:37.031 --> 31:39.053
No, it was a very large picture.

31:39.073 --> 31:40.255
Sounds wonderful.

31:40.295 --> 31:41.556
$30,000.

31:41.676 --> 31:47.503
And in the catalog, they said, bought by Kennedy at Department of Gallery for $30,000.

31:47.604 --> 31:50.267
And they bought a mint.

31:50.327 --> 31:51.288
Oh, man.

31:52.189 --> 31:53.811
America says.
