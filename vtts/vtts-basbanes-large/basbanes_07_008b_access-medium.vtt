00:03.288 --> 00:04.930
You just said the houseman collection.

00:04.950 --> 00:08.534
The houseman collection, I would say, is not of primary importance.

00:08.554 --> 00:20.148
When I have been friends, I've been a friend of a collector in Philadelphia whose library went to Pridmore, the college of Pridmore.

00:20.168 --> 00:31.101
And because of my friendship with him, the Morgan Library invited solely on his collection, in their cases,

00:31.520 --> 00:33.842
Would that be Seymour Adelman?

00:33.982 --> 00:36.745
You know Seymour Adelman?

00:37.345 --> 00:37.706
I know.

00:37.746 --> 00:39.147
I'm doing my work, as you can see.

00:39.227 --> 00:39.628
Of course.

00:39.888 --> 00:41.369
Seymour was a beloved man.

00:41.950 --> 00:46.554
They just smile and think of Seymour, who loves ice cream.

00:46.955 --> 00:51.179
Well, anyhow, Seymour called me about two years before I died.

00:51.879 --> 00:56.143
Father Monahan, he said, Morgan, I didn't want to show off my heart.

00:56.163 --> 00:58.225
I said, this is not mine.

00:58.245 --> 01:00.227
So anyhow, when?

01:00.764 --> 01:09.056
They were showing off the catalog of the exhibition of the Morgan, so three institutions showing off.

01:09.076 --> 01:12.060
We were number three, because my friend said it was Seymour.

01:12.420 --> 01:17.708
We were number three, three out for showing off the collection.

01:18.469 --> 01:30.265
So I had a digression in saying, a horseman collection is good, but who knows, it might get great all of a sudden, because you have opportunity to add to it.

01:30.683 --> 01:34.227
a base, or anything between a corner, we have something before.

01:34.787 --> 01:35.228
That's important.

01:35.708 --> 01:39.913
And then the two together become like, let's say, the Jeffers.

01:40.253 --> 01:43.877
We had a bridge of Jeffers, but now we have a fantastic Jeffers collection.

01:43.897 --> 01:46.219
This is, the La Gallienne is also first-rate.

01:46.379 --> 01:47.661
That's first-rate.

01:47.961 --> 01:56.350
That is, I'm sure that Harvard and Columbia and others will have a great collection, but this is a very significant collection.

01:56.610 --> 01:59.593
As I say, these are all manuscripts down here.

02:00.299 --> 02:07.570
the manuscript value, the benefit if you're studying a text and find out that the printed text is quite different from the Office of Regional Work.

02:07.590 --> 02:09.232
That's why we go to manuscripts, isn't it?

02:09.453 --> 02:09.573
Right.

02:11.376 --> 02:12.858
So, in fact, let's see.

02:13.359 --> 02:18.486
So, when you go out looking, you're not just looking for targets of opportunity.

02:19.047 --> 02:24.435
You have an idea of things that might support the curriculum, shall we say, number one?

02:24.455 --> 02:25.236
Not really.

02:25.256 --> 02:25.577
Not really.

02:25.697 --> 02:28.281
It's only after I see them, I would say, they support the collection.

02:28.666 --> 02:30.949
so that I'm looking over someone's shelves.

02:32.431 --> 02:33.272
That's pretty good.

02:34.073 --> 02:46.811
Now, one of the things I want to stress is the booksellers are very important co-workers with me, with my friendship with them.

02:46.831 --> 02:52.539
And because then they have given, many have given significant things to us.

02:52.739 --> 02:53.500
The booksellers?

02:53.520 --> 02:58.487
The booksellers, not so much they're going to phone me and say, look, I got this, I got that.

02:59.058 --> 03:01.020
They give names together?

03:01.100 --> 03:01.560
Well, they have.

03:01.580 --> 03:05.284
For instance, could you name me Warren Howell, I imagine?

03:05.384 --> 03:08.667
Warren Howell would be Warren Howell, but Howell and Barker, the two ladies.

03:09.147 --> 03:09.828
Who are they then?

03:09.888 --> 03:10.909
Hamill and Barker.

03:10.929 --> 03:11.309
Hamill?

03:11.430 --> 03:14.713
Hamill Francis Hamill, H-A-M-I-L-L.

03:14.733 --> 03:15.814
Oh, she was famous, wasn't it?

03:15.834 --> 03:20.058
And Marjorie Barker, M-A-R-G-E-R-Y Barker.

03:21.719 --> 03:25.943
These were two ladies who were known in trade for years, Chicago.

03:26.497 --> 03:27.939
They were Chicago dealers?

03:27.959 --> 03:28.860
Chicago dealers.

03:28.881 --> 03:29.762
Sellers or whatever.

03:29.802 --> 03:34.729
They are both deceased now.

03:35.090 --> 03:37.553
I was there in 1960, about to know them.

03:41.459 --> 03:50.833
I was looking for Ellen Schaefer's book when I walked into the shop and Marjorie Barker came out

03:51.286 --> 03:54.169
her dad's consent, by my hand, you'll never find it.

03:54.329 --> 03:55.570
Take my copy.

03:56.010 --> 04:00.534
You have that ascribed by Ellen when she gets it back home in California.

04:00.934 --> 04:08.421
So now Francis Hamill, well, Marjorie died first of cancer.

04:08.441 --> 04:14.967
And then she created a commission of trust to her partner and said, I have a certain amount of my estate.

04:15.307 --> 04:19.030
I want to go to our favorite people in America.

04:19.050 --> 04:19.791
Favorite what?

04:21.290 --> 04:26.895
I'm one of four favorites on Francis and Martha.

04:26.915 --> 04:31.159
So I got $200,000 as a trust fund.

04:31.179 --> 04:32.961
Sounds like they were pretty successful booksellers.

04:33.281 --> 04:35.563
Oh, they were very successful.

04:36.844 --> 04:41.449
How did you establish this kind of friendship for people in Chicago?

04:41.469 --> 04:50.537
Well, I would go there every year, and I'd come through seeing donors and possible donors and friends.

04:51.530 --> 04:54.172
I'd say the thing grew.

04:54.733 --> 05:03.581
To give you an example, I was up in the mountains on vacation this month in August, and this is the month that Francis and Marjorie would do their buying, going around.

05:04.542 --> 05:05.803
And so they phoned me.

05:05.843 --> 05:08.645
I was up in the mountains, and they said, we're here.

05:09.086 --> 05:10.127
We just want to say hello.

05:10.147 --> 05:11.047
We don't want to disturb you.

05:11.488 --> 05:12.529
Just to say hello to you.

05:12.609 --> 05:15.111
I said, how long do you want to be there?

05:15.852 --> 05:17.373
Be here until next Friday.

05:18.234 --> 05:19.495
I said, I'm coming down right now.

05:20.318 --> 05:29.170
So, that sort of loyalty of friendship between friends, I think, had an influence.

05:31.513 --> 05:35.758
They had to have certainly believed in what you were doing, too.

05:35.779 --> 05:36.159
They did.

05:36.479 --> 05:44.470
I mean, they saw this priest trying to build a great library, and just the circumstances of

05:45.580 --> 05:51.669
being a Jesuit priest in an institution with not the greatest endowment in the United States, you know?

05:52.109 --> 05:53.832
Maybe she believed in your commitment.

05:53.852 --> 05:54.232
She did.

05:54.352 --> 05:55.073
She did.

05:55.514 --> 05:56.235
They did, rather.

05:56.335 --> 06:00.802
Absolutely no connection at all with Jesuit order, with the Roman Catholic Church at all.

06:00.922 --> 06:01.603
Nothing at all.

06:02.003 --> 06:09.153
That's just me, and that's what I enjoy, being accepted as me, as Bill Monaghan, or Father Monaghan, or Monaghan, whatever you call me.

06:09.214 --> 06:09.694
Father Bill.

06:10.956 --> 06:11.357
Whatever.

06:11.697 --> 06:12.018
Whatever.

06:12.098 --> 06:12.839
It makes no difference.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.182
The thing is that we're friends, friendship.

06:15.567 --> 06:18.810
And so, you know, this happens.

06:18.830 --> 06:21.172
Well, you must project this passion for books.

06:21.192 --> 06:21.512
I do.

06:21.832 --> 06:23.474
But also, I'm helping them, too.

06:24.014 --> 06:26.917
I say, why don't I bring a friend to meet you?

06:27.277 --> 06:28.298
In Chicago.

06:28.598 --> 06:29.519
People, they didn't know him.

06:29.879 --> 06:33.963
I want to bring a friend, a man who had lots of sources to buy books.

06:34.463 --> 06:37.566
So, he said, we got to play with him.

06:38.146 --> 06:41.289
So, I was a mutual help to each other.

06:41.309 --> 06:45.152
How did you develop so many sources, so many friends?

06:45.419 --> 06:51.065
How is it you knew people in Chicago that Marjorie and Ellen didn't know, for instance?

06:51.085 --> 06:54.248
Let me tell you in terms of Rosenthal.

06:54.969 --> 07:02.116
Bernie Rosenthal is now in Berkeley, a bookseller, a famous Rosenthal family, a great family.

07:02.676 --> 07:14.228
As I'm thinking of things I want to show you, give you, this one, he said to me many times,

07:14.748 --> 07:17.072
I can't do my work staying home.

07:17.813 --> 07:19.617
I must, must travel.

07:19.637 --> 07:20.999
And I say the same thing.

07:21.019 --> 07:22.662
Travel is of essence to me.

07:23.564 --> 07:29.314
So I would, they would say, now, Paul, Bill, when you get to Chicago, be sure to meet so-and-so.

07:30.316 --> 07:34.644
Then a note or telephone call, or they'd be ready to see me.

07:34.704 --> 07:36.587
Or going for the grocery store to work.

07:37.428 --> 07:40.733
I'd be on the Goliath Club, or the International Biblical Files.

07:41.053 --> 07:42.014
And you'd meet some people.

07:42.034 --> 07:43.737
I'd meet people, saying, come to see us.

07:43.757 --> 07:45.259
We're next time in Chicago.

07:45.559 --> 07:46.441
Let's get together.

07:46.941 --> 07:47.462
Or Detroit.

07:47.682 --> 07:48.403
Come on.

07:48.423 --> 07:49.164
Or Montreal.

07:50.146 --> 07:51.047
Come on up and see us.

07:51.608 --> 07:52.249
That's right.

07:52.349 --> 07:53.050
I'm a child.

07:53.070 --> 07:53.571
I'd like to do it.

07:54.071 --> 07:57.776
So this led to one thing, to another, to another, to another.

07:57.796 --> 08:05.427
And so that I, my contributions to our library are from Germany, from Canada,

08:05.896 --> 08:07.238
from the United States alone.

08:07.759 --> 08:08.299
Wonderful.

08:08.900 --> 08:15.710
And let's talk a little bit about why are you the only person to have ever thought about an award to recognize Book Collective?

08:16.150 --> 08:22.720
Well, it's just that I saw what the Royal Library of Sweden was doing, and I just thought that would be a good thing to do.

08:22.760 --> 08:26.946
Now, it so happens that Mary Hyde was instrumental.

08:27.326 --> 08:27.867
Mary Hyde.

08:27.967 --> 08:34.536
Mary Hyde was instrumental in Princeton for a while, but they did it only occasionally.

08:34.556 --> 08:35.818
But I kept it up every year.

08:36.220 --> 08:38.702
And Norman Strauss told me this is a very key thing.

08:39.343 --> 08:53.136
He said, Bill, I want you, you've given this point to me, 1968, but I want you to get the very best, because if you got the very best, you didn't get anyone then.

08:54.298 --> 08:56.540
So, Rosenwald.

08:56.780 --> 08:58.662
I've seen your list.

08:58.682 --> 09:02.025
I mean, when I saw that list, I said, how can you beat that?

09:02.225 --> 09:03.366
So it won't.

09:04.027 --> 09:05.788
Well, Bill Shady is not Bill Shady.

09:05.868 --> 09:08.011
That Mary, the Lady Eccles is not there.

09:08.311 --> 09:08.671
That's right.

09:09.092 --> 09:11.254
So you keep it up.

09:11.534 --> 09:13.075
And you've also gone international.

09:13.095 --> 09:16.359
You've picked a Japanese and a Canadian.

09:16.779 --> 09:17.940
Sure.

09:18.441 --> 09:19.822
And you won't have any problem getting it.

09:19.842 --> 09:21.704
What are you looking for when you're looking for it?

09:21.724 --> 09:28.350
You're looking for not just collecting great things, but I guess the willingness to...

09:28.786 --> 09:32.372
Well, the understanding that what you're collecting is a— Well, it's personal.

09:32.392 --> 09:34.796
You're really the custodian, not the owner, I guess.

09:34.877 --> 09:35.418
Oh, yeah.

09:35.438 --> 09:35.798
Oh, yeah.

09:35.818 --> 09:40.847
I think that even though you might have a legal ownership, the corporation of U.S.

09:40.887 --> 09:42.530
South owns these things.

09:42.550 --> 09:50.884
But over the years, things change, and institutions cease to become corporations.

09:50.904 --> 09:52.988
But not just the institutions, but the private collecting.

09:53.609 --> 09:56.532
he or she owns this exquisite item, owns.

09:57.113 --> 09:58.775
It's in my library, it's on my shelf.

09:59.055 --> 10:03.540
But this book is going to live, it's going to be around a lot longer than the human body is.

10:03.621 --> 10:08.146
Besides, you see all these books, a history of decades or centuries of collecting.

10:09.127 --> 10:16.796
And one thing that Nicholas Barker saw here, let me get the book and I'll show you.

10:17.096 --> 10:17.937
It's an author.

10:20.480 --> 10:21.241
Start again now.

10:21.261 --> 10:22.182
Nicholas Barker.

10:22.702 --> 10:33.878
I saw this book on ourselves, and the on its sign is our owls, four owls, five owls.

10:33.898 --> 10:35.780
And it says Thomas Hollis.

10:35.800 --> 10:36.201
Really?

10:36.461 --> 10:38.124
H-O-L-L-I-S.

10:39.386 --> 10:43.652
It was a 17th century Englishman who was a major donor to Howard College.

10:43.732 --> 10:44.072
Really?

10:44.853 --> 10:46.415
Four owls.

10:46.436 --> 10:47.116
I'm just trying.

10:47.557 --> 10:48.538
That's my owl.

10:49.360 --> 10:49.981
Go ahead.

10:50.001 --> 10:50.922
Five owls.

10:50.942 --> 10:51.322
Five owls.

10:51.503 --> 10:51.763
Five owls.

10:52.672 --> 11:08.272
So, now, this came directly to us from a library form by two bishops in Portsmouth, Virchow and Cahill.

11:08.292 --> 11:12.958
Virchow, and V-I-I-T-U-E-N-C-A-H-I-L-L, looks like Cahill.

11:12.978 --> 11:14.680
Virchow and Cahill Library.

11:14.700 --> 11:16.342
The English is called Cahill.

11:16.362 --> 11:16.583
Okay.

11:16.603 --> 11:19.566
And so this is a book of, oh, look at that.

11:19.586 --> 11:20.788
This is a Thomas More book.

11:21.511 --> 11:22.832
It's Lucian.

11:23.493 --> 11:25.955
I use C-I-A-N-I, Luciani.

11:27.056 --> 11:33.681
Actually, it's Lucian, L-C-I-A-N, and it's a translation by Thomas More.

11:34.542 --> 11:34.862
Really?

11:35.483 --> 11:36.904
Yeah, but it's not the person.

11:36.924 --> 11:38.225
It's Lucian of Samosatris.

11:38.245 --> 11:39.186
It's not the same guy.

11:40.587 --> 11:41.828
Is it the satirist?

11:41.848 --> 11:42.108
No.

11:42.128 --> 11:44.931
Well, I'm not up on that.

11:46.092 --> 11:46.492
I don't know.

11:46.512 --> 11:50.776
Is this the Greek satirist, I wonder?

11:50.796 --> 11:51.096
No.

11:51.734 --> 11:57.640
I got to just say, honestly, I don't know.

11:57.720 --> 12:02.866
I'm quoting him in my book, because he has the—no, it's a different one.

12:02.886 --> 12:05.729
He's just a different solution.

12:06.770 --> 12:16.780
But the thrilling thing for me was when people come to your library or my library, they say, oh, now listen, you say, what did you say?

12:16.861 --> 12:17.402
I had this.

12:17.602 --> 12:19.444
I didn't know it.

12:19.604 --> 12:22.807
So what made it significant to Nicholas again?

12:23.428 --> 12:24.049
The owls?

12:24.449 --> 12:24.589
Yes.

12:24.910 --> 12:26.531
Thomas Hollis.

12:26.551 --> 12:29.775
He says, this is a book from the Hollis Library.

12:30.015 --> 12:30.395
I see.

12:30.796 --> 12:34.019
And this is the sign that you would have a signature.

12:34.199 --> 12:36.382
This is a signature of the Hollis Library.

12:36.402 --> 12:38.284
And the significance of Hollis was what?

12:38.304 --> 12:42.729
He's the major, one of the major owners of the 17th century, through Harvard College.

12:42.749 --> 12:43.189
Oh, okay.

12:44.772 --> 12:46.274
Nicholas knew that straight away.

12:47.495 --> 12:47.776
Yeah, right.

12:47.796 --> 12:49.057
He's another enthusiast.

12:49.077 --> 12:55.586
He's a man of genuine honesty with his friends.

12:56.187 --> 12:59.771
As I say, he's a man of great poise.

12:59.791 --> 13:02.695
As I say, he can be a room full of people.

13:02.955 --> 13:05.679
He can sit down and look at that book and hear nothing.

13:05.699 --> 13:14.610
So, I'd say, in fact, I'm a house guest of Brayden's book.

13:14.776 --> 13:25.090
people, collectors, the wives or the husbands will say, we meet the finest people anywhere through this area of collecting.

13:25.110 --> 13:26.192
It brings us together.

13:26.713 --> 13:28.916
Trust costs all boundaries.

13:29.336 --> 13:37.127
But it is interesting to go back to the award, because it does recognize the contribution of the private collector.

13:37.187 --> 13:40.151
And you've taken a little bit of your time and your thought.

13:40.432 --> 13:44.277
You've designed a gorgeous medal, which Sandy showed us,

13:44.594 --> 13:59.853
And you're saying, you're giving a little something back to the collectors, you're giving recognition for their, for their, is it also with the hope that these collectors, not necessarily your library, but they will see fit to make sure that these collections go into public offices?

14:00.034 --> 14:05.661
Well, I'll pre-site an example of a gentleman you met with yesterday, Sandy Berger.

14:06.202 --> 14:12.470
He is thinking every day of his 10-book judgment of where the discussion is going to go.

14:13.190 --> 14:14.432
It could be, I don't know where.

14:14.733 --> 14:26.226
But he really needs a museum plus a library, because the glass you've seen, the Burne-Jones, it's a museum collection and book collection both.

14:27.347 --> 14:29.170
So, I bet you'd go together.

14:29.390 --> 14:30.351
I wouldn't.

14:30.371 --> 14:31.893
I wouldn't.

14:32.053 --> 14:36.538
You know, I'm there.

14:36.638 --> 14:37.799
I'm among these friends.

14:38.500 --> 14:44.487
And so, you just wait and see what's possible.

14:44.804 --> 14:52.815
The thing is that the principle between us, I get recommended to other people, and I keep the circle going.

14:55.639 --> 15:11.520
We discussed Sandy, but let's just not even say, how do you go about going up to an individual, an individual, and initiate a discussion about the ultimate

15:11.990 --> 15:14.694
this position or this collection?

15:14.754 --> 15:18.579
Well, the way you do it is by becoming friends with them for a long time.

15:18.659 --> 15:30.895
Now, Otto Schaefer in Germany, I was his house guest in Germany, in Schweinfurt, in 1988, in July, in June.

15:31.916 --> 15:34.600
And I said, Otto, what are you planning to do?

15:35.021 --> 15:39.887
He says, well, I am planning to leave my lobby to the city of Schweinfurt,

15:40.255 --> 16:03.315
a museum, it'll be like a Huntington Library in Oval, beginning by beginning, but he's a man of great wealth, but he'll fund it for not only for maintenance, acquisitions, for building maintenance, we'll also fund it for people who come to a fellowship museum to study.

16:03.335 --> 16:10.161
So that's what his assist is to do, but because I've known him for so long, I can ask him these questions.

16:10.428 --> 16:12.410
Start out the conversation, of course.

16:12.510 --> 16:13.071
We're back.

16:13.091 --> 16:21.819
But I wrote to him two years ahead, asking me to come to San Francisco to see the colors more metal.

16:22.159 --> 16:27.364
His firm has plants in North America and other places, so he can fit in with his business.

16:27.444 --> 16:28.405
He makes ball bearings?

16:28.586 --> 16:31.208
Yes, ball bearings.

16:31.228 --> 16:34.952
He's probably got the finest individual collection.

16:35.012 --> 16:39.456
Well, Getty's got a pretty good collection of Getty in England, I'm told.

16:39.942 --> 16:42.164
I would say his collection is considered one of the greatest.

16:42.925 --> 16:43.266
It is.

16:43.286 --> 16:44.547
Well, certainly in Germany.

16:45.448 --> 16:47.430
Well, I mean, they say in the world, actually.

16:47.450 --> 16:48.812
Well, it's hard to say greatest.

16:48.832 --> 16:53.657
What is great for each quality of this man in Paris?

16:54.779 --> 16:56.060
Chilet, Henri Chilet?

16:56.240 --> 17:03.348
Sure, who has a manuscript collection, and principally both made of a manuscript.

17:03.368 --> 17:07.393
And he is just as businesslike as any businessman ever.

17:07.813 --> 17:08.734
He has people.

17:10.030 --> 17:15.296
He's keeping record of how many manuscripts are of this way or that way that are available.

17:15.316 --> 17:19.620
So the client comes on the market and says how rare it is immediately.

17:19.640 --> 17:20.561
Isn't that interesting?

17:20.902 --> 17:24.666
And he actually came personally to buy the Utopia at the Martin sale.

17:24.706 --> 17:26.267
He was there.

17:26.287 --> 17:26.908
Did he buy it?

17:26.928 --> 17:27.709
Yeah, he did.

17:28.370 --> 17:29.010
Big money.

17:29.050 --> 17:30.932
A couple hundred thousand, I guess.

17:31.473 --> 17:36.358
Well, his mother is a source of the money.

17:36.980 --> 17:40.184
He owns the pharmaceutical plant.

17:40.204 --> 17:50.538
So I've been in his house, but it was very difficult to see his library, because he would say, look at this, and then he'd move on to that.

17:50.558 --> 17:52.581
So hardly any time to look at anything.

17:52.781 --> 17:56.366
I wanted to sit down and look at something, but I'll show you this.

17:56.966 --> 18:04.236
Have you considered him as a recipient of the award?

18:05.431 --> 18:07.693
I would consider him.

18:07.813 --> 18:11.257
I would consider him.

18:12.858 --> 18:16.162
I don't know if any public association has.

18:16.202 --> 18:17.763
That's very important.

18:17.843 --> 18:22.909
I mean, you have to have some kind of an orientation to the use of it.

18:25.831 --> 18:27.813
See Scheide, for instance, for example.

18:27.914 --> 18:31.337
I mean, that's at Princeton, but scholars go in.

18:31.705 --> 18:35.010
And the Carlton Lake collection is at HRC.

18:35.070 --> 18:37.975
I mean, that's part of the Humanities Research.

18:37.995 --> 18:38.816
There's a guy out in St.

18:38.836 --> 18:41.560
Louis, Brodsky, who's done this Faulkner collection.

18:41.961 --> 18:42.822
What Faulkner?

18:43.303 --> 18:52.817
Brodsky's got the finest Faulkner collection in the world, and he's deposited at this small college, Southwest something college in Missouri.

18:53.138 --> 18:56.283
I'm going out to see him in September.

18:56.303 --> 18:57.384
Maybe I'll send you something on him.

18:57.404 --> 18:58.506
He's a very interesting man.

18:58.570 --> 19:06.619
I'd like to know if I'd like to... He's a very, very interesting man, by the way, because he does... His point is to make this stuff available to scholars.

19:07.360 --> 19:12.185
And, you know, there's another Faulkner collector by the name of Peterson that never made anything available, you know.

19:12.545 --> 19:16.089
Well, you can help me a lot by giving me ideas for future candidates.

19:16.109 --> 19:16.730
Oh, I will.

19:17.050 --> 19:17.310
May I?

19:17.731 --> 19:18.392
I wish you would.

19:19.132 --> 19:27.902
It's because I've been... Part of my job has been to... Is there anything else... Is there anything I've missed, in your view?

19:28.372 --> 19:35.663
Well, all you can do is, for a visit like this, you can get some misnamed reactions when I talk together.

19:35.723 --> 19:40.110
Okay, and I want to read that, I certainly want to read that oral history.

19:40.250 --> 19:41.913
I hope we have it in Massachusetts.

19:42.393 --> 19:44.457
I should think Harvard would have a copy of that.

19:44.557 --> 19:46.640
Well, you can take ours along and mail it back to us.

19:46.700 --> 19:47.401
Can I do that?

19:47.641 --> 19:49.264
That would be wonderful.

19:49.284 --> 19:50.666
Why don't I take a look at the binder?

19:50.906 --> 19:51.527
Okay.

19:52.689 --> 19:55.273
This is probably showing us some

19:56.418 --> 19:57.880
This is Latin American literature.

19:58.240 --> 19:58.761
Borges.

19:58.781 --> 20:16.459
It was a very successful symposium, and the purpose was to give an idea of the writers in Latin America since 65, because that was the Castro, not that they were affiliates of Castro.

20:16.800 --> 20:23.927
Castro helped them express their work, and here's Borges.

20:25.349 --> 20:26.290
B-O-I-G.

20:26.573 --> 20:49.897
I have a friend in New York City who did this, Fuhrman Fink, F-I-N-C-K, F-U-R-M-A-N, first name, and he had Jorge's own whole apartment, and when he finished the portrait, Jorge was nearly blind, took the portrait and looked at him like that.

20:50.338 --> 20:52.841
He said, oh, that's marvelous.

20:53.061 --> 20:55.163
He said, could I sign it?

20:55.565 --> 20:56.767
saying to the artist, can I sign it?

20:56.787 --> 20:57.908
That's ruining the project.

20:58.189 --> 21:00.832
Apparently, my guess is he probably told them, sign it here.

21:00.892 --> 21:02.715
So that's what Borges signed it.

21:02.735 --> 21:03.817
So we have it.

21:03.837 --> 21:05.098
Oh, that's wonderful.

21:05.619 --> 21:06.520
We bought it.

21:06.540 --> 21:08.984
It's $3,000, knocked this down, but we have it.

21:09.024 --> 21:11.067
That's great.

21:11.087 --> 21:12.569
But Borges signed it, which is great.

21:12.589 --> 21:13.030
Borges signed it.

21:13.050 --> 21:13.851
So we have the project.

21:13.871 --> 21:14.271
I love it.

21:14.291 --> 21:17.055
I mean, if Borges wanted to sign it, why not?

21:17.095 --> 21:23.344
He said the experience, he says, of being with that man was such a marvelous occasion for him.

21:23.493 --> 21:26.597
Oh, he's one of the greatest living writers.

21:26.778 --> 21:27.559
Yeah.

21:27.579 --> 21:29.842
Now, these were—I have entertainment always.

21:30.082 --> 21:36.411
This is the program before the reception's announced, I suppose, so Latin American people came.

21:37.252 --> 21:49.770
But then we're coming into the program itself, and then these are—Monegal was at Yale, and he was a ham.

21:50.003 --> 21:52.307
in the sense of, for the puppet.

21:52.327 --> 22:08.412
He was being about 20s himself, 20s himself in the 1950s in Paris, as two fellows just going around having a lot of fun, and they went into various theaters, which caused a lot of trouble, which is just having fun.

22:08.812 --> 22:10.535
So this is a quite a showman.

22:10.755 --> 22:12.438
He gave us wonderful talks.

22:14.100 --> 22:17.766
And this is Leal from the East Santa Barbara.

22:18.472 --> 22:20.595
He died since.

22:23.138 --> 22:24.881
But then all these are connected with collectors.

22:25.121 --> 22:34.434
He was a collector, and we didn't get a chance to buy the library, but these are contacts, too.

22:36.176 --> 22:37.358
And here's Kevin Stone.

22:43.666 --> 22:49.535
This is Father's, did Ruth tell you about the symposiums?

22:49.715 --> 22:51.118
This is major, major.

22:51.178 --> 22:58.869
These people come from Arizona, from the East Coast and so on.

22:58.890 --> 23:00.171
Black tie, I can see.

23:00.672 --> 23:01.614
Oh yeah, that's part of it.

23:01.734 --> 23:03.437
It's part of the thing getting dressed up.

23:06.221 --> 23:10.888
They like to show their fine clothes and all.

23:11.358 --> 23:16.105
I want to take your picture before we leave, if it's all right with you.

23:16.546 --> 23:17.647
Yeah, of course.

23:17.667 --> 23:26.780
So anyhow, these are, um, um, the follow-up, this one, I, I, I... These are more than a place for students.

23:26.921 --> 23:35.393
You have to stimulate, because I formed these from, from here, from, from, from, uh, the, the library.

23:35.713 --> 23:38.257
But if you like what I'm giving you, there's more where that came from.

23:38.337 --> 23:40.200
Here's the library.

23:40.315 --> 23:47.125
It's from Michigan, a very wonderful man from Michigan.

23:47.145 --> 23:47.766
Wonderful.

23:47.786 --> 23:49.389
That's great.

23:49.409 --> 23:51.632
So music, everything, it's one experience.

23:52.754 --> 23:58.463
We got a Borges book collection from one of the scholars.

23:58.503 --> 24:03.050
I think maybe this is the man we purchased his collection of Borges.

24:03.871 --> 24:07.757
So it's always connected with the library and helping us in one way or another.

24:10.032 --> 24:15.440
Yeah, because they're supporting.

24:15.460 --> 24:16.702
They are followed over many years.

24:17.704 --> 24:18.244
There's Sandy.

24:19.366 --> 24:20.007
Isn't that Sandy Bird?

24:20.027 --> 24:21.009
No, no, it looked like him.

24:23.232 --> 24:29.942
It kind of looked like him in profile.

24:29.962 --> 24:30.743
Great.

24:32.185 --> 24:35.230
Pat, why don't you start in 1955.

24:35.598 --> 24:42.087
And my object was to reach the people in the community who support the symphony, the ballet, the opera, and the zines.

24:42.107 --> 24:46.192
And she, the grand dame, said, Father Bill, you've done it.

24:46.212 --> 24:47.153
Who's that?

24:47.334 --> 24:48.796
Margaret St.

24:48.896 --> 24:49.637
Aubyn.

24:49.657 --> 24:50.358
S-T period.

24:50.678 --> 24:51.860
A-U-B-Y-N.

24:52.280 --> 24:52.761
Margaret St.

24:52.781 --> 24:53.382
Aubyn.

24:53.402 --> 24:55.324
And she's saying, Father, you've done it.

24:55.384 --> 24:56.105
You've done it.

24:56.125 --> 25:01.032
Meaning I reached out, and she helped me a great deal.

25:01.501 --> 25:02.562
I'm what I am.

25:03.043 --> 25:07.007
But she had the context, and she made sure that we got out to people.

25:07.027 --> 25:11.412
And looking at these photographs of these various symposiums, you say, this is PR, my style.

25:11.552 --> 25:12.573
My style, yeah.

25:14.875 --> 25:15.456
These are fresh.

25:15.476 --> 25:16.277
She's from Arizona.

25:17.598 --> 25:18.760
But this is more than PR.

25:18.820 --> 25:19.680
This is meaningful.

25:19.981 --> 25:24.045
This is, you're doing something that's productive.

25:25.327 --> 25:25.547
Yeah.

25:26.087 --> 25:27.209
Yeah, it's kind of connected.

25:27.229 --> 25:31.373
We have to, the library must be part of the community.

25:31.572 --> 25:33.794
And then the menus.

25:33.814 --> 25:40.001
We'd have the Dostoyevsky dinner, the Dostoyevsky dinner.

25:40.021 --> 25:40.641
I love those.

25:40.661 --> 25:45.406
Let me just read a couple of these for the Dostoyevsky dinner, which was in 1981.

25:45.626 --> 25:46.928
Shout out to the whole world.

25:46.948 --> 25:48.209
That's the continuing name.

25:48.229 --> 25:48.910
No, it's the title.

25:49.170 --> 25:59.120
We have cold cream of asparagus soup, veal, G-A-R-C-H-I-Z-A, broccoli, grilled tomato, creme de menthe sundae.

25:59.140 --> 26:01.242
Also, in other words, you're trying to do the

26:01.643 --> 26:03.125
Yeah, yeah.

26:03.145 --> 26:06.488
Kind of cute.

26:06.509 --> 26:09.612
And then Musogorski.

26:09.632 --> 26:11.294
I'm sorry?

26:11.314 --> 26:17.361
Then I would try to get themes from the writers or composers, some of the people who've used them.

26:17.381 --> 26:20.905
There's the M-U-S-O-R-G-S-K-I-I dinner.

26:20.925 --> 26:22.126
That was in 81 as well.

26:22.727 --> 26:24.809
Oh, so you had these successive nights.

26:25.650 --> 26:26.932
Yeah, it was too much.

26:27.052 --> 26:30.656
Now we only have one dinner, and we had a small buffet.

26:30.676 --> 26:30.756
Wow.

26:31.057 --> 26:32.178
on Thursday night.

26:32.198 --> 26:33.639
I was going to say, that's pretty ambitious.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.001
But too much, too much.

26:35.021 --> 26:38.003
But I couldn't listen to the common sense.

26:38.023 --> 26:39.084
People said, that's too much.

26:39.265 --> 26:42.467
Well, they're still coming, aren't they?

26:42.487 --> 26:42.908
At the St.

26:42.948 --> 26:45.050
Francis yacht club, I noticed, which is nice.

26:45.450 --> 26:48.113
And this one is at the Pacific Union Club.

26:48.153 --> 26:50.034
Well, that is a wonderful place to entertain.

26:50.054 --> 26:52.016
One of the finest old mansions of San Francisco.

26:52.276 --> 26:52.937
Which the?

26:52.957 --> 26:53.758
That's wonderful.

26:55.439 --> 26:59.443
I'm going to take a couple pictures, if it's OK with you.

26:59.913 --> 27:00.874
The Rosenthal.

27:00.894 --> 27:01.555
Oh, it's the Rosenthal.

27:02.216 --> 27:03.998
He says, we're not like the Rothschilds.

27:04.359 --> 27:05.440
The Rothschilds have the money.

27:07.483 --> 27:14.472
So he gave a talk here, and the second time he was at Harvard, and the third time at the Newbury Library.

27:15.393 --> 27:26.888
And in the keepsake, for occasion, you have the family tree, and Jacques Rosenthal of Munich was, in a sense, the ancestor.

27:28.050 --> 27:29.852
This is the man who sold to the generation

27:30.153 --> 27:36.219
of Temple and Crocker here, of Morgan in New York, and so on.

27:36.239 --> 27:37.781
A great, great bookseller.

27:38.041 --> 27:41.244
And the Olske firm is the female side of the family.

27:41.585 --> 27:44.267
So, it would be the Roosevelt and Olske.

27:44.868 --> 27:53.697
And so, this, then I have the whole family coming down, the generations coming in, and only the booksellers in the family, with many other families.

27:53.717 --> 27:55.238
He's the booksellers members of the family.

27:55.899 --> 27:58.742
So, and he is a dear person.

27:59.110 --> 28:05.337
And I would love to have you know him, because he is a traveler, and the two of you should know each other.

28:05.397 --> 28:06.458
Bernard Rosenthal.

28:06.879 --> 28:08.580
And where is, where would I reach him?

28:08.600 --> 28:09.101
In Berkeley.

28:09.501 --> 28:09.702
Okay.

28:11.223 --> 28:13.506
I went to Berkeley this afternoon, as a matter of fact.

28:15.348 --> 28:16.549
And Rosenthal.

28:17.090 --> 28:22.456
You ask Ruth, when leading, for that address or telephone number.

28:22.876 --> 28:22.996
Okay.

28:23.016 --> 28:28.122
Bernard Rosenthal, a bookstore in Berkeley.

28:28.473 --> 28:40.904
But he is, now, I asked him, our friendship is such that he's given me many things for the library, some great manuscripts and so on, for the library.

28:40.944 --> 28:50.252
And so I said, Arnie, I would love to have a collection of catalogues of your grandfather, Jacques Bosenthal, of Munich.

28:50.272 --> 28:54.496
I said, I don't know if I can afford it, but he said, oh, poor God.

28:55.036 --> 28:56.978
So he gave me a near-complete book.

28:57.380 --> 28:59.522
A collection of it.

28:59.542 --> 29:06.869
There was an auction in Germany that, what's the big auction in London?

29:07.470 --> 29:08.791
Sotheby's.

29:08.991 --> 29:09.412
Sotheby's.

29:09.732 --> 29:15.097
Sotheby's had an auction, sawing off the things of an auction, in Munich.

29:15.117 --> 29:16.578
This was during Hitler's time.

29:18.260 --> 29:25.547
And the day before the reception, the Gestapo put on Jew in a Ura, Jew outside.

29:25.966 --> 29:34.580
And people, this is, I can only say this without tears, but people came to pay respects to the family, and did look at the collection.

29:38.166 --> 29:40.891
And, isn't it a touching thing?

29:41.372 --> 29:42.634
But this is a great family.

29:42.814 --> 29:47.943
It's a great family, and so... And obviously, it's a book family.

29:47.963 --> 29:49.425
A book family, book family.

29:49.658 --> 29:57.790
But these people, very successful, very successful, and, as I say, travels all the time.

29:58.170 --> 30:08.986
The thing is, I'm probably, Ruth maybe can give me, if this is a little too tight to set up something for today or tomorrow, but maybe I can make contact with him, and I'm coming back, I think, in about two or three months.

30:09.006 --> 30:11.770
Telephone call is enough just to make out who you are, and so on.

30:11.790 --> 30:12.731
And he can help you a lot.

30:13.092 --> 30:17.558
But a lot of people that you know, you can say, how about John Doe?

30:18.079 --> 30:18.560
Yeah.

30:19.261 --> 30:19.581
That's great.

30:20.219 --> 30:26.005
But he's an excellent person.

30:26.085 --> 30:31.750
We have tried to honor people who have done things with public benefit.

30:32.030 --> 30:38.937
And Franklin Murphy, Dr. Franklin Murphy, he was Times Mirror paper in Los Angeles.

30:39.638 --> 30:45.303
And he was the chancellor of the University of Kansas, UCLA.

30:46.584 --> 30:49.467
And although he was a chancellor, he

30:49.683 --> 30:55.156
really made it possible for the libraries to grow enormously in both, in both, both places.

30:55.998 --> 31:00.248
So, uh, Murphy, we wanted him to tell him a fellow of our library associates.

31:03.155 --> 31:03.355
Thank you.
