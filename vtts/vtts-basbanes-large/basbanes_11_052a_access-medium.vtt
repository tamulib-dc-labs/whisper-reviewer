WEBVTT

00:02.714 --> 00:03.936
my audio tape here.

00:04.056 --> 00:04.477
I know.

00:05.038 --> 00:05.638
Sure.

00:05.658 --> 00:11.147
I'm talking to Jim Kerwin here, tape one in San Francisco.

00:15.233 --> 00:21.502
Let me put this over here.

00:21.522 --> 00:25.528
This is the opening of a... This is an opening of a videotape.

00:25.549 --> 00:29.194
It's called The Library of the Future.

00:29.883 --> 00:32.066
It's about the San Francisco Public Library.

00:32.086 --> 00:38.535
It was made in 1988 by Somebody Communications.

00:38.555 --> 00:39.556
It's on the tape.

00:40.398 --> 00:42.941
Had the money already been approved for a library at this point?

00:44.163 --> 00:44.383
No.

00:50.291 --> 00:54.557
You know, we'll watch it, and if you don't mind, I'll take it with me and make a copy of it and return it to you.

00:59.735 --> 01:02.138
And you can feel free to speak out loud as we watch this.

01:02.158 --> 01:15.816
Tell me what particularly... I'll try and keep the comments in the room so you... I want you to have this to look at because it will confirm later in your mind what was desirable and what wasn't for these people to do.

01:16.697 --> 01:21.503
Okay, San Francisco Public Library, so this is a tape, clearly either made by them or for them.

01:22.444 --> 01:24.086
By Davis Community.

01:24.687 --> 01:26.890
About 1,800 hours after a rush hour for most of us.

01:27.410 --> 01:44.404
And there's a great light show in the sky about San Francisco.

01:44.424 --> 01:46.228
Imagine yourself.

01:46.208 --> 01:50.394
Here, here's our man's future.

01:50.474 --> 01:52.637
Hey, who is it?

01:52.917 --> 02:04.153
Nobody's ticket, but you say that.

02:04.213 --> 02:08.339
Yeah.

02:10.402 --> 02:12.925
Wow.

02:18.018 --> 02:19.580
Welcome home, Mr. Taylor.

02:20.001 --> 02:21.944
Environmental service will be here.

02:21.964 --> 02:25.529
No inclusions in security zone 142.

02:25.569 --> 02:28.253
Telecommunication report.

02:28.273 --> 02:29.335
Voice mail, two messages.

02:30.056 --> 02:31.999
Televaccine, one message.

02:32.580 --> 02:33.842
Video test.

02:33.862 --> 02:35.264
International use on screen 3.

02:35.284 --> 02:36.986
Stop report on screen 4.

02:37.207 --> 02:40.451
Why don't you just go up to run down there and be part of this library?

02:40.471 --> 02:41.994
All the policies are stable.

02:42.014 --> 02:42.895
Did not be prepared.

02:43.094 --> 02:47.020
Your report for advanced dynamic systems is due tomorrow.

02:47.601 --> 02:51.287
Today is Monday, November 8, 2001.

02:52.028 --> 02:58.838
Have a good evening.

02:58.858 --> 03:01.142
So you need information on various subjects.

03:01.162 --> 03:03.786
And he's punching stuff now into the...

03:10.263 --> 03:16.995
Find a source.

03:17.015 --> 03:28.214
13 years early in the future.

03:28.234 --> 03:28.775
Specify available services.

03:28.795 --> 03:30.598
Need help?

03:30.618 --> 03:30.718
Yeah.

03:59.639 --> 04:12.918
It is a building designed to last well into the 21st century.

04:13.238 --> 04:20.728
A magnificent structure of glass, steel, and stone, bringing new beauty to the classic Renaissance architecture of Civic Center.

04:20.789 --> 04:26.136
Some stores over 400,000 square feet of usable space

04:26.588 --> 04:30.292
house and disseminate the most important commodity of our century.

04:31.474 --> 04:32.074
Information.

04:34.537 --> 04:46.491
Inside a world-class facility, spacious and bright, the hub of a regional information network, is a knowledgeable world home to the citizens of San Francisco.

04:46.651 --> 04:54.520
There is a knowledge center, talent, preserve, organized, handmade, graphic, and written documents

04:55.124 --> 05:09.242
It is an information center using current technology to produce and collect information that is available from home, in the office, or at the library.

05:09.262 --> 05:09.863
A future robotic voice.

05:09.883 --> 05:11.304
Would you describe it as a robotic voice?

05:11.405 --> 05:11.665
Yes.

05:11.685 --> 05:13.467
It is a communication center.

05:14.028 --> 05:20.356
The nucleus of an information network that can access data from all over the world and distribute it quickly.

05:20.376 --> 05:21.377
But nothing to stop it.

05:21.918 --> 05:23.680
Nothing to swallow it.

05:24.875 --> 05:35.661
This is a noble institution lending the knowledge of the past to the technology of today and tomorrow.

05:37.261 --> 05:43.494
The business and economic development section provides immediate access to valuable information and data.

05:43.514 --> 05:47.662
Within minutes, office computers are online.

05:48.324 --> 05:58.324
It is a new age resource designed to keep San Francisco business one step ahead of the competition.

06:00.835 --> 06:12.803
An expanding children's section.

06:13.441 --> 06:19.289
a discovery center offering knowledge and creativity in a safe, secure environment.

06:19.309 --> 06:28.101
With story hours, comprehensive book correction, creative playtime is in the tools to stimulate and challenge young minds.

06:28.121 --> 06:33.728
The largest children's library on the West Coast offering our children the technology to solve problems

06:33.708 --> 06:35.810
for the future.

06:36.611 --> 06:39.013
They live on computers.

06:39.033 --> 06:44.839
The physical records have catalogued and preserved important city documents in the physical archives.

06:45.059 --> 06:46.541
The history of San Francisco.

06:46.581 --> 06:47.462
The city archives are gone.

06:47.482 --> 06:51.986
Find the information at the fingertips of decision-makers 24 hours a day.

06:54.168 --> 07:00.715
Any Asian or civil rebellion, a unique and historical meeting of Eastern knowledge.

07:00.735 --> 07:02.156
That never happened.

07:02.176 --> 07:03.057
That never happened.

07:03.948 --> 07:08.235
Information and data on the files of the privacy.

07:08.255 --> 07:12.461
I think I say, hey, look, yes, sure, but he's got the work in change.

07:12.481 --> 07:29.348
The card catalog, a partial out-of-date index of library holdings, has been replaced by the online public access catalog, a completely integrated and current listing of all library resources, video tapes, laser discs, microfilm, periodicals, and books.

07:29.328 --> 07:35.879
Through the online public access catalog, any library holding will be located and reserved.

07:36.720 --> 07:43.712
And fiber optic technology allows you to get that information at home, at the office, or at any branch library.

07:43.772 --> 07:50.323
And it will even find materials in other library systems across the country or across the world.

07:52.092 --> 07:58.361
It is a public facility, providing many necessary public services in that district center area.

07:58.661 --> 08:00.784
Oh, we did it again.

08:00.804 --> 08:06.592
All to transmit ideas in a public forum, allowing public participation of neighborhoods.

08:06.992 --> 08:10.337
I'll show you the one.

08:11.077 --> 08:17.224
Community meeting groups where groups of citizens can share their concerns, even when a library is closed.

08:17.244 --> 08:28.017
The literacy project is coordinated by library staff, teaching the skills of weeding, and opens the door to full participation in our modern society.

08:28.558 --> 08:34.585
The Center for the Book, where rare and priceless collections of protective and environmentally controlled rules.

08:35.306 --> 08:38.890
This Center for the Book was to be, they were going to put books under glass.

08:39.241 --> 08:46.090
Because books were going to become a thing of the past, they were going to build a monument to the book.

08:46.991 --> 08:49.454
Making it like a laboratory specimen, so to speak.

08:49.474 --> 08:50.416
Right, right.

08:50.436 --> 08:52.879
When the public found out about it, they went ballistic.

08:53.400 --> 09:03.953
They had to cancel their precious... So if we would just go back a tad, and maybe we can watch that again.

09:03.974 --> 09:04.354
Right there.

09:07.169 --> 09:10.780
...participation in our modern society.

09:11.322 --> 09:17.601
The center for the book, where rare and priceless collections are protecting and environmental controls.

09:17.851 --> 09:25.138
and displayed from public appreciation, image collection, and the Revolute Scholar Program.

09:25.158 --> 09:35.328
Over 2 million books, 12,000 videotapes, document delivery, special programs for seniors and young adults.

09:35.849 --> 09:44.297
Full and complete access to all library services for the blind and handicapped with expanded facilities for the deaf and hearing impaired.

09:45.982 --> 09:51.370
The San Francisco Public Library provides the resources demanded by the information age.

09:51.931 --> 09:56.397
It is the nucleus of an information delivery system dedicated to serving the public.

09:56.838 --> 10:03.828
The primary source of knowledge and achievement at the center of this modern metropolis.

10:03.848 --> 10:06.832
Knowledge, information, communication.

10:07.654 --> 10:10.818
The three elements that will shape our society in the year 2000.

10:11.920 --> 10:15.465
How well we answer the challenge ahead depends on what we do today.

10:16.711 --> 10:20.955
The steps we take now will ensure that we're prepared to meet those challenges.

10:22.316 --> 10:29.323
But while we are firmly rooted in the present, we must always keep an eye on the future.

10:34.588 --> 10:39.533
Well, here you go.

10:39.553 --> 10:46.380
Close to the right, Q-O-N-A-P-I-R.

10:47.137 --> 11:07.002
This was inexpensive.

11:20.347 --> 11:27.875
That's a huge step.

11:29.136 --> 11:35.903
Look at this.

11:35.923 --> 11:43.651
Look at this.

11:43.671 --> 11:44.973
Kenneth Dallas is a librarian following his staff at the library.

11:44.993 --> 11:45.833
Kenneth Dallas is probably a relative kid.

11:45.854 --> 11:46.354
This is all we have here.

11:48.629 --> 11:50.791
for partial underwriting of this program.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.393
I mean, there's nothing illegal about this.

11:52.413 --> 11:52.473
No.

11:52.713 --> 11:53.694
It's worth noting.

11:53.974 --> 11:54.274
All right.

11:57.518 --> 11:58.899
Why don't we stop?

12:00.380 --> 12:00.741
Back it.

12:02.943 --> 12:06.927
Back, back, back, back, back.

12:06.947 --> 12:07.247
All right.

12:07.287 --> 12:07.547
Stop.

12:07.567 --> 12:07.787
Wait.

12:07.808 --> 12:09.849
And what we'll do is... U.S.

12:09.870 --> 12:17.657
Department of Education, under the provisions of the Library Services and Construction Act Title I,

12:18.008 --> 12:21.613
and three, administrative in California by the state librarian.

12:22.094 --> 12:27.241
However, the opinions expressed herein do not necessarily reflect the position or policy of the U.S.

12:27.322 --> 12:32.429
Department of Education or the California State Library, and no official endorsement by the U.S.

12:32.469 --> 12:36.234
Department of Education or the California State Library should be heard.

12:36.395 --> 12:41.702
But this was a publicly funded PR tape, apparently.

12:41.722 --> 12:42.423
Apparently.

12:42.443 --> 12:45.268
No, quite, quite pointedly, I think.

12:45.288 --> 12:45.568
Yeah.

12:47.725 --> 12:55.977
Why is that significant, Davis Communications?

12:55.998 --> 12:59.703
Well, that's just what's, that's who they call for copyright.

12:59.723 --> 13:02.047
Okay.

13:02.067 --> 13:06.393
I don't need to ask anybody's permission right away or anything.

13:06.413 --> 13:06.513
Okay.

13:06.533 --> 13:14.205
Well, no, I mean, first of all is... And the last poll was regarding the Black Journalist.

13:14.489 --> 13:28.588
Well, Dan, it may only be a year old, but boy, does it have problems.

13:28.668 --> 13:42.606
Channel 7 News has learned that a newly completed audit shows library operations $700,000 in the red.

13:42.856 --> 13:49.987
The fallacial library is an architectural showcase, but the red ink is just part of the trouble.

13:50.088 --> 13:57.259
The more traditional has no place in this library.

13:57.640 --> 14:00.464
The glass and chrome building is flooded with light.

14:01.025 --> 14:08.357
Car catalogs serve as decorative pieces of art, and the cars that once inhabited them have creative wall coverings.

14:08.692 --> 14:15.001
and the computers with internet access are attracting people who have never used the library system before.

14:15.762 --> 14:19.367
We are more popular than the 49ers in the Bronx.

14:19.467 --> 14:23.433
Those crowds are one element straining this high-tech showpiece.

14:23.453 --> 14:31.765
Employees are rarely seen by patrons, but behind the scenes are grappling with mounds of books, which are used often months ago.

14:32.426 --> 14:35.931
And, uh...

14:36.653 --> 14:41.578
College student Jennifer DeLue has heard it before.

14:42.119 --> 14:47.404
And she may not be able to the next time.

14:47.424 --> 14:52.089
With a looming debt, the library may remain severely short-stamped.

14:52.109 --> 14:58.216
The hiring of a new head librarian may be delayed, and purchases of new books may be put on hold.

14:58.796 --> 15:02.340
Although critics say there was never room for them in the first place.

15:03.333 --> 15:11.624
No doubt the building feels spacious enough to accommodate the tens of thousands of patrons that visit the library each week.

15:12.165 --> 15:23.520
Yet librarians say actual shelf space for books is so puntier that according to one estimate, over a third of the circulating collection remains in storage.

15:24.361 --> 15:28.547
Hundreds of thousands of books have already been given or thrown away.

15:28.848 --> 15:42.820
and critics charge with so little shelf space, that trend will continue.

15:44.602 --> 15:57.673
That may be, but no matter how troubled, San Francisco's Library of the Future may be giving younger patrons just that, the future.

15:58.430 --> 16:05.459
But still, the fact remains, library operations are deeply in debt, as we discover to the tune of $700,000.

16:05.520 --> 16:09.986
Mayor Willie Brown has been briefed on the preliminary findings of the new audit.

16:10.406 --> 16:20.720
Mayor Willie Brown bought off Channel 7, ABC World News tonight, which had real figures, and had pictures of Brooks Hall to go with it.

16:20.740 --> 16:22.923
For this report here, one prior.

16:23.824 --> 16:26.047
And so what happened was they tanked it.

16:26.468 --> 16:26.648
Yes.

16:27.640 --> 16:30.384
Which we have the records of.

16:30.404 --> 16:30.504
Yeah.

16:30.524 --> 16:35.231
He or she aggressively after he returned from his trip to Philadelphia next week.

16:35.251 --> 16:35.471
Ben?

16:35.872 --> 16:37.194
While he was in Philadelphia.

16:37.635 --> 16:38.255
Willie.

16:38.276 --> 16:38.596
Willie.

16:38.636 --> 16:40.439
We sent those photographs after him.

16:40.719 --> 16:42.742
And the Philadelphia Inquirer ran the story.

16:43.283 --> 16:46.668
We take that back to a copy of him in the file.

16:47.028 --> 16:48.330
Because of their situation.

16:48.631 --> 16:50.273
And because they liked the picture of Willie.

16:51.164 --> 16:54.028
So these problems at the library begin the moment this thing opened a year ago?

16:54.229 --> 16:54.890
Pretty much.

16:55.310 --> 17:03.803
When people started looking, decided to leave the library, a strategy was put into place not to hire new people to replace them.

17:03.863 --> 17:08.070
So overtime was put into play, and that's when the bill started out.

17:08.090 --> 17:09.191
That was not it.

17:09.852 --> 17:12.336
Technology is the core of the cost.

17:12.356 --> 17:15.741
They were trying to blame the staff for that.

17:15.761 --> 17:16.362
Well, so if the...

17:16.510 --> 17:17.892
That's why we had the audit.

17:17.912 --> 17:20.656
So does the audit tell us what they spend on technology?

17:20.676 --> 17:21.978
The audit didn't tell us jack shit.

17:22.478 --> 17:28.747
The reason was, it goes back to this, that's what all that correspondence is about.

17:29.528 --> 17:34.535
They did not want to get into digging into what it was really all about.

17:36.598 --> 17:40.764
The administration of the library wants to say, ah, overpaid staff.

17:40.964 --> 17:42.286
That's the reason.

17:42.306 --> 17:45.150
Well, 30% of the staff services only the computers anyway.

17:45.991 --> 17:47.653
And they are some of the highest paid people.

17:47.673 --> 17:49.915
30% of the staff is computers only.

17:49.995 --> 17:52.718
How do you know this, though?

17:53.279 --> 17:54.440
From the library commission.

17:54.540 --> 18:00.727
So the question is, how much of the staff, wait for me now, I'm posing my question.

18:01.307 --> 18:05.131
How much of the staff, how much of the staff?

18:05.151 --> 18:06.813
78% of the staff.

18:07.233 --> 18:10.136
I just finished asking them that at the last library commission.

18:10.156 --> 18:13.500
And Gina said, what Gina said to me, 78% of the staff,

18:14.459 --> 18:17.022
78% of the costs are the staff.

18:17.103 --> 18:19.806
4.5% is book.

18:19.826 --> 18:21.308
7.1% is computers.

18:21.368 --> 18:25.334
So is she telling the truth, or is that accurate?

18:25.434 --> 18:26.535
That's what they're telling her.

18:26.856 --> 18:28.918
Okay.

18:28.938 --> 18:29.699
All right, Mabel's wrong.

18:29.719 --> 18:31.842
Thanks very much for that.

18:31.862 --> 18:32.063
Come here.

18:32.083 --> 18:33.885
Always one more little quick bet here.

18:33.965 --> 18:39.092
Bill, it was hailed as the shining example of how... At the same time, no, this is a later story.

18:39.212 --> 18:42.897
This is about a week later when the audit finally came out.

18:43.518 --> 18:44.941
No, a couple days later, I think.

18:45.001 --> 18:46.003
It should be on.

18:46.023 --> 18:47.545
But how do you know these things are coming on?

18:48.167 --> 18:51.112
Like, you know these reports are coming on.

18:51.152 --> 18:53.677
How did you know they were coming on?

18:54.458 --> 18:56.903
We've been on them like a dirty load.

18:57.023 --> 18:57.985
So they were worried.

18:58.005 --> 18:58.205
Yeah.

18:58.305 --> 19:02.573
What we did was, prior to the audit release, Channel 7...

19:03.380 --> 19:05.402
This is the same channel we just watched before?

19:05.462 --> 19:13.550
Yeah, but Channel 7 initially released that little thing to protect the mayor's ass about when the audit was going to be released, because nobody knew when it was.

19:13.570 --> 19:15.391
It was late, it was late, it was late, it was late.

19:16.152 --> 19:26.822
So when it finally came out, about three days before it came out, I faxed everybody in a known universe with these really clear criticisms of what the audit didn't do.

19:28.204 --> 19:32.728
To my surprise, these people bought what we said, and you're going to see the end result.

19:33.164 --> 19:46.038
They released the audit that night, and these guys went on the air along with Channel 4, which is NBC, and Jeff smacked them, basically saying this was half-assed.

19:46.058 --> 19:54.668
All over the Bay Area should operate, but a $50,000 audit just released a short time ago indicates that other libraries should not make the same mistakes.

19:55.229 --> 20:01.956
As Channel 7's Deborah V. Alone explains, the Fancy U facility has all the bells and whistles, but just can't deliver the basic service.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.937
Return a book to the new main library.

20:05.957 --> 20:09.718
It drops to the basement and joins the crowd.

20:10.036 --> 20:34.373
books sit here for weeks waiting to be reshelled there's no one to do it only five employees work in this sorting room i'm talking about people genuinely making themselves sick trying to keep this building running with not enough people the library commission knows it has problems there's been a hiring freeze since the budget dipped into the red and mayor brown ordered an audit

20:34.859 --> 20:36.561
Tonight, the results came in.

20:36.581 --> 20:45.811
21 recommendations, from hiring new managers, to finding more storage space, to training staff on the computers scattered throughout.

20:46.512 --> 20:53.480
This library is state-of-the-art, packing in twice as many users, but a victim of its own success.

20:53.760 --> 20:55.342
It's not surprising.

20:55.362 --> 20:57.184
The system comes on the boundary.

20:57.204 --> 20:59.406
That was their national mantra.

20:59.907 --> 21:01.148
Victim of its own success.

21:01.168 --> 21:02.489
Victim of its own success.

21:02.509 --> 21:04.832
Only that's not true.

21:05.234 --> 21:10.461
in a very short period of time after a long, long short of not having much time.

21:10.481 --> 21:20.834
Okay, well... Every change that the audit recommends costs money, as much as $3 million, mostly to hire people to get all these books back on the shelves.

21:20.854 --> 21:23.698
I want your fingers to indicate how many books they've loaned out in comparable periods.

21:24.940 --> 21:26.562
Of course, they're going to say, well, it's more than books.

21:26.582 --> 21:29.105
We've got computer hits and all this other stuff.

21:29.185 --> 21:34.532
I'd be curious to know how many books... They have people counters that show numbers of people.

21:35.035 --> 21:37.117
Yeah, but I want to know how many books have been borrowed.

21:37.798 --> 21:40.661
That is one statistic we have not been able to get.

21:40.681 --> 21:41.622
Maybe you'll have more luck.

21:41.662 --> 21:43.183
Have you asked that question?

21:43.364 --> 21:44.565
Yeah.

21:46.347 --> 21:48.749
Didn't get anywhere.

21:49.029 --> 21:50.551
Well, I'm just a journalist here.

21:50.631 --> 21:54.315
I just heard somebody say that they are a victim of their own success.

21:55.216 --> 21:57.458
They made a declarative statement.

21:59.360 --> 22:01.182
So successful, how can we show this?

22:01.582 --> 22:02.063
So fine.

22:02.123 --> 22:02.623
I'll say, really?

22:02.643 --> 22:04.165
Well, how many books have you loaned out?

22:04.499 --> 22:08.984
This year as opposed to the year when you were in the old Maine in the previous year.

22:09.104 --> 22:10.987
We have figures, but they must be given.

22:11.007 --> 22:11.868
We have computers.

22:11.928 --> 22:13.850
Computers tell you how many books you loaned out.

22:14.511 --> 22:15.592
I would be curious to know.

22:15.632 --> 22:22.921
But I'm sure that they will say, well, we don't judge success strictly by computer, by book loans, because we do so many other things.

22:22.941 --> 22:23.882
That's what they're going to say.

22:24.743 --> 22:26.285
And then, you know, fine.

22:26.585 --> 22:32.532
One of the things is that in one of these reports, several people, they have what they call a fill rate.

22:33.288 --> 22:35.110
Fill rate.

22:35.250 --> 22:36.812
This is a national thing.

22:36.912 --> 22:37.833
All libraries do it.

22:38.194 --> 22:41.738
And what it does is attempt to measure customer satisfaction.

22:41.758 --> 22:45.362
The fill rate in the San Francisco Public Library is 37%.

22:45.923 --> 22:55.414
That means that when a person comes to the library, four times out of ten, they're going to find what they look for.

22:55.434 --> 22:56.855
Only four times out of ten.

22:57.116 --> 23:00.139
The other six times, they will not find what they're looking for.

23:01.199 --> 23:05.905
for Brown and the Board of Supervisors to come up with some money.

23:05.925 --> 23:08.028
We will endeavor to make it work for everyone.

23:08.288 --> 23:18.040
Just as the audit has pointed out that there's some issues that are rough and need to be addressed, I think the mayor is going to review that very carefully in the upcoming budget and take steps to fix it.

23:18.120 --> 23:26.331
And fix it fast, because every day 5,000 more books come back, joining the 50,000 waiting in the basement.

23:26.851 --> 23:29.755
Deborah Villalone, Channel 7 News, tonight.

23:33.245 --> 23:35.367
Dashed hopes tonight for the library.

23:35.667 --> 23:58.306
Some parents in the South Bay are vowing to step up their fight against pornography.

24:00.188 --> 24:02.610
Some hunger strike to the great boycott.

24:03.805 --> 24:04.947
I forgot, right?

24:05.267 --> 24:07.090
Who is I, the excellent file?

24:07.110 --> 24:09.253
It's a wonderful model.

24:09.874 --> 24:15.322
Now, this is what?

24:16.644 --> 24:22.353
Register.

24:23.294 --> 24:23.594
Register.

24:25.818 --> 24:26.960
Register.

24:26.980 --> 24:28.382
Register.

24:29.644 --> 24:29.824
Register.

24:29.844 --> 24:30.365
Register.

24:30.385 --> 24:30.705
Register.

24:31.126 --> 24:31.807
Register.

24:31.827 --> 24:32.007
Register.

24:32.442 --> 24:41.394
For weeks on end, professional movers swarmed over the entire collection of San Francisco's 80-year-old main library.

24:41.414 --> 24:47.042
A million books were on these shelves, some well-thrumped, some gathering dust for years.

24:48.003 --> 24:51.408
The collection, while large, had been disarray for decades.

24:51.929 --> 24:53.070
Books had disappeared.

24:53.511 --> 24:54.973
Others had been thrown away.

24:55.730 --> 25:00.197
Now, at last, the library was on the verge of a new era.

25:00.657 --> 25:10.352
When the movers were finished in early spring, they had transferred every book across Fulton Street to new shelves in a breathtakingly new building.

25:10.372 --> 25:17.623
The distance is short, but the journey is... They just said that they put all one million books in the new library.

25:18.224 --> 25:20.687
I heard a figure of three million, though, at a previous tape.

25:21.749 --> 25:22.530
That's in the whole system.

25:22.780 --> 25:28.266
But in the new Maine, they said they moved all one million books from the old Maine to the new Maine.

25:29.227 --> 25:30.709
There are 37,000 short.

25:30.869 --> 25:36.936
An often neglected library into a marvel for the 21st century.

25:36.956 --> 25:46.587
San Francisco has gone in 10 years from a neglected system to a cutting-edge system in the center.

25:47.048 --> 25:52.534
This building is a bridge from the past to the future.

25:53.257 --> 26:02.349
I don't think there's anyone who got there where they are in life without having to leave a public library.

26:02.369 --> 26:16.166
San Francisco will begin the millennium in the midst of a cultural and civic renaissance.

26:17.027 --> 26:20.091
Visual evidence is all around.

26:20.341 --> 26:24.164
The New Museum of Modern Art dominates the South of Market skyline.

26:25.746 --> 26:34.594
Just across Third Street, a recently opened view of Buena Gardens provides calm and culture against the glorious backdrop of the city.

26:34.614 --> 26:41.900
The Palace of the Legion of Honor has been renovated and included in growing crowds.

26:42.100 --> 26:48.306
And the DeYoung Museum in Golden Gate Park is due for major reconstruction.

26:48.556 --> 26:52.982
City Hall is getting the treatment too following the 1989 earthquake.

26:54.224 --> 27:02.114
The jewel in the crown completing the grand plan for the Civic Center is the building just finished at this site.

27:05.839 --> 27:07.522
The new main library.

27:08.483 --> 27:12.268
In four years it went up and in these images it looks so easy.

27:12.738 --> 27:25.954
But getting to this point was fraught with politics, cultural jealousy, indifference, benign neglect, and incredible determination by a few people that overcame all that.

27:28.537 --> 27:35.305
Fundraisers, activists, architects, librarians, and donors.

27:36.146 --> 27:42.373
The champions were not the politicians who never were quite sure what to do about the library.

27:43.130 --> 28:03.434
It's an intriguing story how this library came to be.

28:03.454 --> 28:08.260
The public library had always been an orphan in the cultural household of San Francisco.

28:08.915 --> 28:14.722
The sophisticated and the well-to-do in this city were generous to the opera, the symphony, and the ballet.

28:15.583 --> 28:23.473
The principal constituency of the public library came from a far different, less affluent strata of society.

28:23.493 --> 28:33.686
Surprisingly, it was a powerful group, able to generate the support that made this building possible.

28:33.706 --> 28:36.289
It included people like Jade Snow Wong,

28:36.590 --> 28:41.917
who long before she became a ceramicist, was the best-selling fifth Chinese daughter.

28:42.618 --> 28:46.644
She grew up poor in Chinatown.

28:46.904 --> 28:49.307
Around 11 years old, I started going to the library.

28:50.308 --> 29:03.306
I never was allowed outside of Chinatown, but going to the library was okay, and I would take out four books every day, meaning I would buy four books, and I would eat a book a day and go back the fifth day and get four more books.

29:03.944 --> 29:12.855
I think I was fascinated because through the books I learned about all the big world outside of San Antonio and the world of mixed views.

29:13.976 --> 29:20.885
Wong and people with similar experiences became the grassroots from which the new library grew.

29:20.905 --> 29:22.126
I don't know.

29:22.146 --> 29:25.831
It's to me the frontier of democracy.

29:25.931 --> 29:27.733
A few libraries.

29:28.154 --> 29:30.897
Everybody, no matter how poor, they have.

29:31.687 --> 29:44.344
But the story of San Francisco's library begins long before Wong's early memory.

29:44.644 --> 29:51.093
Even in its wild gold rush days, San Francisco was a literary town.

29:51.914 --> 29:57.782
The first public library borrowed or rented space for their small collection.

29:57.802 --> 30:00.225
The library, like the city, was on the move.

30:00.391 --> 30:05.379
In 1898, it took over a wing of the new city hall.

30:05.399 --> 30:09.426
In April 1906, earthquake and fire.

30:09.466 --> 30:10.207
I love this stuff.

30:10.227 --> 30:16.056
The city hall was severely damaged by the earthquake.

30:16.077 --> 30:19.502
It took a while for the fire to get to the library.

30:19.622 --> 30:26.854
And once it did, it burned virtually everything that was in the library.

30:27.458 --> 30:41.717
Peter Booth Wiley has written a history of the library and the city.

30:43.660 --> 30:50.589
But from the ashes, the new city grew, determined to enhance its prominence as a cultural center of the West.

30:52.271 --> 30:55.896
A new grandiose library in the Bozart style went up.

30:56.129 --> 30:59.193
in a reborn civic center near the new city hall.

31:01.235 --> 31:06.581
Opened in 1917, the main library at first worked wonderfully.

31:06.922 --> 31:09.885
The monument is a cultural and art.

31:10.026 --> 31:16.874
It is a beautiful building with grand staircases and huge... They're going to talk about how dark and dingy it was.

31:17.174 --> 31:22.120
What they don't tell you is that they painted the skylights black in order to make it more dingy.

31:22.454 --> 31:25.337
Which television station produced this?

31:25.717 --> 31:26.357
Channel 9.

31:26.518 --> 31:27.178
Channel 9.

31:27.458 --> 31:30.201
You don't know what they're called.

31:31.802 --> 31:31.902
KQED.

31:32.443 --> 31:32.643
KQED.

31:32.663 --> 31:35.846
I think I'll call them and find out when it was broadcast.

31:35.966 --> 31:40.770
This was rebroadcast just last week.

31:40.890 --> 31:42.111
That's what we're watching.

31:42.131 --> 31:42.532
I see.

31:42.672 --> 31:43.413
Oh, really?

31:43.433 --> 31:44.293
Yeah.

31:44.313 --> 31:46.515
It was broadcast on National.

31:46.736 --> 31:49.378
Portions of it were on NewsHour with Jim Lehrer.

31:50.419 --> 31:51.820
And portions of it were

31:54.247 --> 31:56.329
Well, do they get into any of the problems here?

31:57.411 --> 31:58.612
Or is this... Yeah.

31:58.632 --> 31:59.052
Copy.

32:02.656 --> 32:03.177
June 22nd.

32:03.337 --> 32:03.597
Here.

32:06.000 --> 32:06.841
June 22.

32:06.941 --> 32:08.303
That was local.

32:08.463 --> 32:08.823
1996.

32:09.324 --> 32:13.969
And July 22nd, 1996, was national.

32:14.089 --> 32:14.810
July what?

32:15.170 --> 32:15.451
22nd.

32:16.472 --> 32:17.934
Same day, the month.

32:17.954 --> 32:18.815
1997.

32:19.155 --> 32:19.275
Sixth.

32:19.643 --> 32:40.825
It will soon become the Asian Art Museum.

32:41.530 --> 32:47.277
Among its admirers is historian and former city librarian, Kevin Scott.

32:47.337 --> 32:50.862
It has a monumental feel of all great libraries that year.

32:50.882 --> 32:53.445
You don't really need any library, do you?

32:53.465 --> 32:54.707
More like a museum.

32:54.727 --> 32:59.753
Well, Spencer, do we need the Mona Lisa?

33:00.534 --> 33:02.657
Do we need the dome under the Capitol?

33:03.198 --> 33:05.160
It'll make a nice museum.

33:05.180 --> 33:07.103
Isn't it a great library?

33:07.123 --> 33:07.944
It's a delightful museum.

33:07.964 --> 33:09.626
It's a spectacular public space.

33:09.646 --> 33:10.547
Single light bulb.

33:10.607 --> 33:11.048
Look at that.

33:11.197 --> 33:14.901
The old Maine, as it's now called, had an aura about it.

33:15.601 --> 33:19.425
Gladys Hanson worked there for 40... Point of interest.

33:19.845 --> 33:31.337
Last year, the library spent $92,000 on light bulbs alone.

33:31.357 --> 33:33.298
Founding the San Francisco History Room.

33:33.879 --> 33:38.243
Today, she runs the Museum of the City of San Francisco.

33:38.263 --> 33:40.005
There's like a barn.

33:40.137 --> 33:41.459
But it was home.

33:42.099 --> 33:43.361
It corrects you.

33:43.842 --> 33:46.064
It made you feel comfortable.

33:46.565 --> 33:48.607
And of course, the military says it's a dress code.

33:48.828 --> 33:52.052
You wore heels and you were dressed and so forth.

33:52.172 --> 33:55.275
I can remember going out in the back and all those big marble floors.

33:55.295 --> 34:03.445
We'd take off our high heels and we'd go with our bare feet to pick up the books, come back, put our heels on again and go out to the public.

34:04.286 --> 34:08.912
The history room still includes wonderful collections of old and rare books.

34:09.803 --> 34:15.611
Librarians mothered volumes from the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and the Enlightenment.

34:16.412 --> 34:22.299
But for all its collections and affection, there was plenty wrong with what they called the Old Man.

34:23.140 --> 34:29.749
For one thing, it filled up with books by 1943 and became nearly impossible to manage.

34:30.290 --> 34:32.012
The new librarians stopped that.

34:32.192 --> 34:33.894
They're not buying any books.

34:33.934 --> 34:36.638
Librarian Ken Dowling found when he came to work.

34:37.242 --> 34:49.173
It was quite embarrassing to be a person with two master's degrees and a 30-year library director, and I couldn't find a book in the Old Main Library because of the way it was organized and laid out.

34:50.014 --> 34:54.858
Mr. Dowling, because of that, decided to create his own filing system.

34:54.878 --> 35:05.528
He did away with the Dewey Decimal System and he created something called Leveled Access, which was to jam everything together so that he had fewer categories to bother with.

35:06.908 --> 35:11.953
It created a massive, massive nightmare, which they are now trying to unravel.

35:13.655 --> 35:26.167
Both funds to even care for the facility, the lighting in there apparently was extremely dark, and the walls were unpainted and very dreary, and the place had a feeling of abandonment about it.

35:27.249 --> 35:31.633
The library was an embarrassment to the city that prided itself on culture.

35:32.170 --> 35:39.517
In the 1950s, the Chronicle ran an expose on the disgraceful condition, written by Hale Chandler.

35:39.978 --> 35:42.900
In San Francisco, there was a feeling of frustration.

35:43.461 --> 35:51.949
Politicians didn't allocate enough money to buy books, catalog them quickly, and hire trained professional librarians to manage the system.

35:52.790 --> 35:59.296
And the library couldn't compete with music and arts for private funds.

35:59.316 --> 36:00.878
Over the next 40 years,

36:01.246 --> 36:05.711
succession of librarians and their supporters tried to bring order to the chaos.

36:06.633 --> 36:12.780
Kevin Starr marched with costumed Minutemen to draw up support for more funds.

36:12.800 --> 36:19.308
But politicians, perennially faced with budget shortfalls, saw the library as vulnerable.

36:19.328 --> 36:25.856
Not just the main library, but the branches, too.

36:26.677 --> 36:30.662
Well, we all thought him was a good guy, and I don't know

36:31.233 --> 36:32.375
I think he's a little both.

36:32.415 --> 36:35.659
In other words, he's got a political agenda to maintain and stay.

36:35.859 --> 36:40.446
He was approached about taking it over after Dallin when he passed.

36:40.886 --> 36:41.767
So that's a little bit.

36:41.808 --> 36:42.048
Yes.

36:43.009 --> 36:48.817
But he is, in his own right, a very well-thought-of librarian.

36:49.338 --> 36:52.562
Which is a hell of a highly regarded historian.

36:52.863 --> 36:53.704
Yeah.

36:53.964 --> 36:59.171
But some of the things that went on after, he's one of the people that didn't want to build a new building.

37:00.053 --> 37:00.413
Really?

37:00.680 --> 37:09.771
Yeah, they tried to get him to, and that's why he had to, I think that's the reason he was no longer the city librarian, because he refused to outright.

37:09.791 --> 37:15.137
He was a librarian then, and they brought Gallim in supposedly just to build this new building.

37:16.058 --> 37:18.861
And would it have to have been, because Kevin Starr said no.

37:19.522 --> 37:24.848
Because he saw no reason to tear the building down, or desert the building, just to build a new one.

37:24.908 --> 37:25.949
I mean, it didn't make any sense.

37:27.631 --> 37:28.392
Did he say something so slow?

37:28.777 --> 37:31.400
that there was a lot of pressure on me to consolidate.

37:31.841 --> 37:36.246
And the special nature of San Francisco is such that I held the line and I did not close branches.

37:37.147 --> 37:50.664
So the library community throughout the state began to develop its political expertise, began to learn to lobby, began to learn to get its message out to the community, and that made it much more difficult for an elected official, for a mayor, to come in and to arbitrarily cut a budget.

37:51.805 --> 37:54.869
The library had developed a constituency of its own.

37:55.470 --> 37:58.193
Among the devotees were people like Dorothy Bryant,

37:58.510 --> 38:05.636
who grew up in a poor Italian-American family in the Mission District and later became a best-selling novel.

38:05.656 --> 38:06.477
It was the 30s.

38:06.817 --> 38:08.379
There were no paperback books.

38:08.399 --> 38:09.199
There were no books.

38:09.219 --> 38:11.662
There was no money to buy books.

38:11.682 --> 38:17.287
And as soon as I learned to read, boy, I was up here every day hanging out in this room.

38:17.307 --> 38:20.289
So it's a very special feeling to come here.

38:20.850 --> 38:21.891
What were the librarians like?

38:22.992 --> 38:27.876
Oh, they were very much like the stereotypical librarian who said, hi.

38:28.210 --> 38:32.396
kept everything still, and they were all lost.

38:32.416 --> 38:35.460
They were not Italian-Americans as I was.

38:36.000 --> 38:39.545
The new library has mobbed children screaming and yelling.

38:39.565 --> 38:42.489
They were very kind.

38:43.851 --> 38:48.697
The branches in the residential neighborhood still evoke the most loyalty.

38:48.797 --> 38:53.003
They have become like the distance they are in centers of ethnic diversity.

38:53.590 --> 38:58.537
First stop for immigrants trying to maintain their own cultures and learn a new one.

38:59.518 --> 39:03.083
Many of the city's new residents seek out books in their native languages.

39:03.885 --> 39:07.990
The branches supply them and try to cater... Not anymore.

39:08.010 --> 39:17.624
This year, just for your own information, you should know, no foreign language books have been purchased.

39:17.744 --> 39:23.412
So everything about that... You don't know...

39:24.117 --> 39:38.340
While the 26 branches tried with rather skimpy collections to meet the needs of the neighborhood, the main library remained the brains of the system, backing up the branches, directing them, and setting the tone.

39:38.360 --> 39:47.475
It was the main that guarded the valuable collection, like the music room's incredible treasure trove of sheet music, part of America's pop culture.

39:47.995 --> 40:13.328
But even the five collections could erase the fact that the main library was in bad shape and was ignored in first aid.

40:13.578 --> 40:22.349
That was evident to San Francisco philanthropist Marjorie Stern and her fellow fundraisers, Margaret Mayer and Mary Louise Stonk.

40:22.949 --> 40:31.941
My family, my father had a great library, which went to Stanford because he didn't think that Stanford School was sitting at rare books properly.

40:32.081 --> 40:34.003
And so he got married.

40:34.163 --> 40:37.788
And he was very upset with the committee that it didn't do more.

40:37.828 --> 40:39.970
So that was the reason I got involved, really.

40:41.893 --> 40:42.133
Stern.

40:42.316 --> 40:50.366
friends with many of the city's wealthy and powerful, decided to lead the fight to build a new library, a great library.

40:50.947 --> 40:51.888
And it was a fight.

40:52.969 --> 40:55.993
We had a target, which was the new main library.

40:56.354 --> 40:59.197
We had to make people feel that it was a possibility.

40:59.538 --> 41:00.959
Cincinnati, Cleveland.

41:01.720 --> 41:03.443
One of the things about Ms.

41:03.543 --> 41:09.370
Stern, so you know, every politician runs for office, a dog catcher up,

41:10.008 --> 41:10.729
Five bucks.

41:11.410 --> 41:15.596
And five bucks to $50,000 gets from Stern.

41:15.616 --> 41:15.936
Really?

41:16.397 --> 41:18.540
Just so that all her phone calls are returned.

41:19.201 --> 41:20.322
Absolutely.

41:20.623 --> 41:25.870
So she became this, over many years, this woman has become this powerhouse.

41:27.032 --> 41:30.557
And this was her driving passion, was to have a new library.

41:30.577 --> 41:32.039
And so that's where that all came from.

41:32.059 --> 41:34.202
And she did say that her daddy was a bibliophile.

41:34.642 --> 41:36.886
I wonder if she was at my talk at the Roxburgh Club.

41:36.906 --> 41:38.648
She's the kind of person that would have been there.

41:39.185 --> 41:42.490
We have several wannabes here that aren't.

41:42.650 --> 41:45.775
We have a James Haas who runs the Civic thing downtown.

41:45.995 --> 41:48.659
One not related to the Haases that own Levi Strauss.

41:50.362 --> 41:53.126
Miss Stern is not related to the Sterns.

41:53.246 --> 41:54.568
She is a standalone.

41:55.209 --> 41:57.733
And in both cases... But she's wealthy enough already.

41:58.735 --> 41:59.556
Wealthy enough, yes.

42:01.510 --> 42:03.952
Philadelphia, our library town.

42:03.993 --> 42:06.915
That was a symphony opera and ballet town.

42:07.076 --> 42:07.936
That's where she comes.

42:07.956 --> 42:09.298
What are you fighting against?

42:09.318 --> 42:10.539
We didn't just socialize.

42:10.559 --> 42:14.363
That's me and Meg, I guess.

42:14.483 --> 42:19.168
Yeah, and too many things begging attention, you know.

42:19.728 --> 42:27.636
The people who could afford to make something happen, many of them assume the library is for poor people.

42:28.317 --> 42:29.098
It's not for us.

42:29.158 --> 42:30.319
We can afford to buy books.

42:31.312 --> 42:33.595
So it was in a different category.

42:34.396 --> 42:37.620
The problem was who would pay for a new library?

42:38.140 --> 42:44.969
The San Francisco Public Library would proceed primarily as a municipal service rather than a cultural institution.

42:45.689 --> 42:48.953
And so there's an reluctance for people to raise money for government.

42:49.014 --> 42:50.255
After all, we gave it the office.

42:50.275 --> 42:51.316
We gave it tax time.

42:53.719 --> 42:55.562
A bond issue would be needed.

42:55.582 --> 43:00.087
But first, Stern had to fight to keep the site envisioned for the new library.

43:00.674 --> 43:09.767
It was across Fulton Street from the Old Main with a small city planning department building that had gone up as a USO headquarters in World War II.

43:10.188 --> 43:14.895
Supporters of Cochrane wanted that site for a symphony hall.

43:15.636 --> 43:21.525
So as widely people perceived the Performing Arts Center, people was coming along and essentially stealing their sights.

43:22.005 --> 43:23.267
It was a pretty intense fight.

43:23.287 --> 43:26.292
It was a very intense fight, and it didn't look good for a long time.

43:26.712 --> 43:28.274
Like this, right in this room.

43:28.294 --> 43:30.057
We would just sit down and have it out.

43:30.357 --> 43:34.522
with all these different groups and everyone's colliding and then seeing where they're there.

43:35.062 --> 43:36.404
It's a political process.

43:36.484 --> 43:38.786
It really is.

43:38.806 --> 43:45.173
Tough negotiations by Stern and her friends ensured that the library won back dollars.

43:45.193 --> 43:48.877
Once cleared, the site for the new library oozed history.

43:49.818 --> 43:55.805
Archaeologists pored over what had been the ceremonial heart of the city in the last century.

43:55.825 --> 43:59.689
They found evidence of the cemetery that was here before 1870.

44:00.175 --> 44:05.042
and the old city hall and jail, which perished in the earthquake and fire.

44:05.162 --> 44:12.813
Building a library here required a lot of money, and getting a bond issue about was a big hurdle.

44:12.893 --> 44:18.781
Even librarian Kevin Starr felt there wasn't enough public or political support.

44:18.801 --> 44:21.044
Today he admits he was short-sighted.

44:21.825 --> 44:27.533
I didn't think that we could jump from one of the most neglected public library systems in the nation

44:27.935 --> 44:32.180
and automatically overnight become one of the most, one of the best finances.

44:32.360 --> 44:34.182
I thought there'd be a little difficulty in between.

44:34.662 --> 44:40.449
And being a prudent San Franciscan, I thought that the recycling of this heritage building would be the best alternative.

44:40.869 --> 44:45.915
Now, I presented that to the commission, and the commission said, no, that's not what we want.

44:45.935 --> 44:46.756
We want a new building.

44:47.256 --> 44:51.261
And therefore, Roma, La Cuccia, Causa, Sanita, Rome has spoken.

44:51.761 --> 44:52.642
The cause is finished.

44:52.822 --> 44:54.004
The commission makes policy.

44:54.364 --> 44:55.906
I kept my mouth shut from that point on.

44:56.106 --> 44:57.047
Almost everybody...

44:57.348 --> 44:58.409
Love libraries.

44:58.610 --> 45:00.592
It's an American institution.

45:00.612 --> 45:04.217
With Ben Franklin and Thomas Jefferson on, everyone loved libraries.

45:04.938 --> 45:12.728
Banking on that, Steve Coulter, president of the Library Commission, led the campaign for $110.5 million in bonds.

45:13.670 --> 45:16.674
Proposition A, which finally got on the ballot in 1988.

45:16.694 --> 45:21.440
You talk about the constituency of the public libraries.

45:21.680 --> 45:23.823
You're talking about the average person.

45:24.284 --> 45:26.747
A lot of working class people, regular Americans.

45:27.588 --> 45:36.220
But Coulter says some opposition sprung up from strange bedfellers, business interests and neighborhood activists.

45:36.240 --> 45:43.410
The business community was somewhat irritated because of the closure of the downtown business branch.

45:43.430 --> 45:46.694
Some of the neighborhood activists were somewhat skeptical of the new name.

45:47.155 --> 45:52.622
They saw that as, you know, money going downtown wasn't in a specific neighborhood.

45:52.883 --> 45:56.167
To everyone's surprise, the bond issue passed.

45:56.267 --> 45:57.409
It wasn't even close.

45:58.148 --> 46:02.973
78% of the voters in unheard of margin for San Francisco voted yes.

46:07.078 --> 46:14.627
It was a glorious day for Marjorie Stern and friends in 1992 when construction got underway.

46:14.647 --> 46:23.477
The plans were grandiose and politicians who had a marginal role in the new building were happy to share in the credit.

46:23.517 --> 46:28.122
The man of the hour was the principal designer

46:28.405 --> 46:30.207
Architect James Ingo Free.

46:30.868 --> 46:36.616
He and co-designer Kathy Simon had a mission imposed on them by the voters.

46:37.077 --> 46:38.999
They're being sued by the city.

46:39.380 --> 46:39.880
The architect?

46:40.361 --> 46:41.202
Yep.

46:41.222 --> 46:41.683
Where is that?

46:44.587 --> 46:47.250
Failure to, there's a piece of correspondence about it.

46:47.270 --> 46:50.274
Failure to just hide the building properly.

46:50.334 --> 46:51.776
The plans are illegible.

46:52.417 --> 46:56.983
And they've had so many change orders and so many problems with this.

46:57.003 --> 46:58.345
They have no choice but to sue them.

46:58.763 --> 47:01.869
because they can't possibly, it's still, it's not up to Clarkos.

47:01.909 --> 47:03.371
It doesn't meet any in the city.

47:03.391 --> 47:06.877
It's a mess, a total mess.

47:06.898 --> 47:08.701
More than a traditional library.

47:09.562 --> 47:18.819
It also had to reflect in an artistic way both the spirit of the new technological age and the diversity of a changing city.

47:18.939 --> 47:21.784
The building itself is really designed to be people's space.

47:22.945 --> 47:31.854
and it was designed to be space for people, connect with people, and connect with books, connect with computers, connect with resources.

47:31.874 --> 47:34.777
First of all, its function is to bring light into the building.

47:34.797 --> 47:36.619
It's a very big building.

47:36.639 --> 47:40.203
Each floor is about an acre and a third, which is a very big area.

47:40.403 --> 47:45.349
So we have these three entrances, and all of them come to this place of light.

47:45.809 --> 47:51.535
This building is about how light enriches our lives and how a library brings light to the world.

47:51.802 --> 47:58.831
undertaking.

48:00.553 --> 48:10.526
Principal architect James Ingo Freed, who has Parkinson's disease, recently finished the Holocaust Museum in Washington.

48:10.546 --> 48:15.092
He was enthused about building a free library in San Francisco.

48:15.112 --> 48:16.333
Free library.

48:16.433 --> 48:19.117
I learned a free library.

48:19.397 --> 48:21.640
I learned a free library during the

48:22.565 --> 48:24.608
He's sitting in the stacks and hiding out.

48:25.149 --> 48:28.514
He tries to understand what this madness is all about.

48:28.534 --> 48:38.669
Fried designed a complex, transparent building with bridges from one section to another, a metaphor in a city of bridges.

48:38.689 --> 48:42.034
He says it's a speaking person's building.

48:42.054 --> 48:43.776
A building can make you think, it's safe.

48:43.797 --> 48:45.319
A building can make you smile, it's safe.

48:45.339 --> 48:46.440
A building can be part of your life, it's safe.

48:46.781 --> 48:50.867
And just so people will come in, look up and say, wow.

48:51.303 --> 49:05.441
I need to raise money in order to furnish the building.

49:06.342 --> 49:17.597
The bond issue would only pay

49:22.387 --> 49:25.756
We didn't want to actually have chairs or computers, bookshelves.

49:26.398 --> 49:29.285
Any enhancements to the building all had to come from private money.

49:29.687 --> 49:36.244
So we had to find some ways of convincing the public that it should actually give cash to the library.

49:39.160 --> 49:45.549
The message that Coulter and others hit upon was a milestone in the history of fundraising and of this library.

49:46.049 --> 49:53.700
They decided to tap into San Francisco's amazing diversity and to raise funds among what they called affinity groups.

49:53.720 --> 50:03.053
That would be gays and lesbians, African, Latino, Chinese, and Filipino-American, and environmental.

50:03.073 --> 50:07.058
Within the library, centers for each affinity group were planned.

50:07.460 --> 50:33.130
I urge you to be a part of the purpose to help us burn the mortgage on this piece of the library, on this piece of frankly the first pure evidence for a lifetime of our existence and our contribution in the future.

50:33.329 --> 50:42.863
When you go to the African-American room, you must note that when you walk in the room, the building is 16 months old now.

50:42.903 --> 50:45.026
There's a large patch in the carpet.

50:45.126 --> 50:49.052
The carpet was supposed to last 30 years.

50:49.252 --> 50:54.019
It didn't make it through six months, and it's still there.

50:54.039 --> 50:55.100
They never did change it.

50:55.581 --> 50:58.425
There are rips in it, tears.

50:59.165 --> 51:00.647
It's pathetic what's down there.

51:00.747 --> 51:02.048
Look on what's on the shelves.

51:02.088 --> 51:05.733
The African-American community didn't get what they promised them.

51:06.454 --> 51:07.575
Nobody got what they were promised.

51:09.517 --> 51:11.480
But they can count it.

51:11.520 --> 51:20.170
And what it's done is drive stakes through the heart of an institution that's been around for a very long time to serve all people.

51:20.390 --> 51:24.295
And by setting up these special little enclaves, they've created a problem.

51:25.557 --> 51:27.860
We're traveling first class.

51:28.161 --> 51:31.105
We didn't get in at the end of the caboose.

51:31.526 --> 51:36.193
We got in from the beginning, and we're pinning our own way.

51:37.074 --> 51:52.136
It became rather easy to go out to the Filipino-American community and say, here is our chance for a Filipino-American presence, which heretofore had never existed, and to be in an American mainstream cultural institution.

51:52.156 --> 51:54.940
We use a kind of psychological

51:55.088 --> 52:02.560
challenge and say, we occupy 20% of the chicken population.

52:02.580 --> 52:05.806
How can we not do it?

52:05.826 --> 52:09.111
I mean, how do we live with that kind of skill?

52:09.652 --> 52:17.164
The first time that I just go out and I said, well, you know, you could get $5,000 in this human being system.

52:17.184 --> 52:18.987
I mean, for a $5,000.

52:19.523 --> 52:32.119
The affinity centers are carefully planned attractive rooms.

52:32.880 --> 52:40.249
This one, for gay and lesbian correction, received almost double the goal, a total of nearly $3 million.

52:40.465 --> 52:55.019
San Francisco philanthropist James Hormel donated half a million dollars for a project unlike any the gay community had supported before.

52:55.980 --> 52:59.123
They had to take the doors off because they promised them a librarian.

52:59.424 --> 53:03.848
The doors were on there and locked because the books behind there don't belong to the citizens.

53:03.868 --> 53:06.891
They belong to the gay and lesbian community.

53:07.571 --> 53:09.173
When they couldn't provide a librarian,

53:09.912 --> 53:12.702
the gay and lesbian community-making take the doors down.

53:12.722 --> 53:14.509
Now these are custom-made steel doors.

53:15.593 --> 53:18.403
And so the books are in there, but there's no librarian.

53:20.729 --> 53:45.994
Librarians deal with both the lofty and the more practical.

53:46.784 --> 53:53.093
They had to figure out a strategy for a problem with the devil's libraries in all large cities.

53:53.113 --> 53:58.161
The homeless who see a public library as a place to sleep or hang out.

53:58.782 --> 54:01.766
The only issue to us is their behavior.

54:02.527 --> 54:07.695
We do have standard rules of conduct for behavior for everyone, not just homeless.

54:08.917 --> 54:11.661
And we do not allow people to sleep in the building.

54:12.890 --> 54:18.716
Librarian Dowland had a thousand other details to worry about and plan for.

54:18.856 --> 54:27.144
Her new name, in a city whose economy is tied to high-tech Silicon Valley, was designed with a computer in mind.

54:27.525 --> 54:30.708
Every desk has a data port for a laptop.

54:30.728 --> 54:33.611
This patron from Oakland is writing a book on his.

54:35.012 --> 54:38.796
A bank of TV sets and VCRs is constantly in use.

54:39.434 --> 54:46.362
showing educational, informational, and entertainment tapes to anyone, anytime.

54:46.382 --> 54:50.107
The photo collection... That fell apart early.

54:50.207 --> 54:53.090
It's been shut down for about nine months on and off.

54:53.210 --> 54:55.112
It may be on now again, I'm not sure.

54:55.333 --> 55:00.158
But many of these services never materialize or materialize and fail.

55:04.463 --> 55:06.606
...and into computers for easy viewing.

55:08.054 --> 55:19.290
terminals dedicated to specific uses are constantly busy, like this one that helps you buy or sell a new or used car, or this one that assists in a job search.

55:20.712 --> 55:28.783
The library's catalog is now available only on computer, which bothers some librarians and some patrons.

55:28.803 --> 55:36.694
I doubt if I'll ever go into the new library because I'm already uncomfortable because I won't feel that I can walk in and find anything.

55:37.130 --> 55:38.912
I don't know how to use that computer.

55:39.553 --> 55:40.914
I want to talk to a person.

55:40.954 --> 55:47.642
I want to actually touch somebody.

55:47.702 --> 56:05.382
As if to answer hands and spears, librarians have been trained to help the public operate the more than 300 terminals in the library, sometimes in basics, often in searching the internet for needed information.

56:06.273 --> 56:14.927
Hanson still isn't convinced that libraries benefit from high tech.

56:15.248 --> 56:20.356
The one that I grew up in is a grand old lady.

56:20.376 --> 56:25.224
The other is a new kid on the block and we're ready to wait and see which will survive.

56:28.008 --> 56:30.913
Robin Williams for the new Maine Library.

56:31.433 --> 56:34.838
Hello, you're watching TV right now, but I'd like to ask you to see something different.

56:35.158 --> 56:35.439
Book.

56:35.939 --> 56:36.320
Friend.

56:36.440 --> 56:37.261
Many books.

56:37.281 --> 56:37.742
Family.

56:38.022 --> 56:38.743
Come on down next floor.

56:38.763 --> 56:40.266
Tell us this is called New Main Library.

56:40.566 --> 56:42.228
Grand opening celebration on Sunday, April 21st.

56:42.309 --> 56:42.569
Be there.

56:42.629 --> 56:43.831
How do we do it?

56:43.851 --> 56:44.131
Volume!

56:44.672 --> 56:50.140
On opening day, 12,000 people heeded Robin Williams' invitation.

56:50.160 --> 56:57.390
They streamed inside the new building and fanned out to examine the wares and the affinity centers and the same question.

56:57.657 --> 57:06.370
The mayor headed for the children's section, where computers are as popular as Winnie the Pooh.

57:07.371 --> 57:14.802
In a way, the library is using computers and programs popular with kids to get them to read books.

57:14.822 --> 57:20.610
It is also preparing them for life in the increasingly... That has since been proven to be false.

57:20.630 --> 57:24.195
Start them on computers, no good book.

57:24.215 --> 57:25.277
No.

57:25.297 --> 57:27.580
Yeah, well, there was a big story in the Atlantic one.

57:27.813 --> 57:37.684
Areas where jobs are linked not just to leading literacy, but to computer literacy as well.

57:37.704 --> 57:44.071
Marjorie Stern had no trouble finding the book she wanted, a free library in the city.

57:44.091 --> 57:51.139
As the undaunted, tenacious fighter for the new building, she got to check out the first book.

57:51.159 --> 57:54.343
But for the public, it wasn't so easy, at least at first.

57:54.847 --> 57:58.512
Lines were long to check out books and get new library cards.

57:58.852 --> 58:01.035
You sure have Steven Coulter.

58:01.055 --> 58:07.744
We don't have any time he can use in the library a week.

58:07.764 --> 58:10.006
Because I'm not supposed to know this.

58:10.026 --> 58:10.828
But he doesn't have a library card.

58:10.888 --> 58:14.632
The signed books didn't get put back on the shelves quickly.

58:14.733 --> 58:21.782
It looks like there's five individual or 10 cents each, which means five books will return a day late.

58:22.482 --> 58:24.465
In the first few months of operation,

58:24.749 --> 58:31.996
Usage of all aspects of the library, especially the high-tech features, was far heavier than anticipated.

58:32.837 --> 58:37.121
Critics sniped that there wasn't enough shelf space for all the books.

58:37.141 --> 58:41.426
All this put a strain on the staff and on the operating budget.

58:41.446 --> 58:47.732
We have about two and a half million books in our collection, the largest in public libraries in Northern California.

58:47.932 --> 58:52.917
So we have 15 million items that are not catalogued, and we need to get our documents

58:54.095 --> 58:57.278
15 and a half million that are not catalogued.

58:57.398 --> 58:57.999
What did he say?

58:58.740 --> 58:59.320
I'll back it up.

59:03.244 --> 59:03.825
That's okay.

59:04.906 --> 59:10.191
Peace out there.

59:10.211 --> 59:13.555
Staff and the operating budget.

59:13.615 --> 59:18.820
We've got about two and a half million books in our collection, the largest in public libraries in Northern California.

59:19.306 --> 59:29.718
But we also have 16 million items that are not cataloged, and we need to get our documents, get our rare books into the catalog so people can find them and locate them.

59:29.738 --> 59:34.103
To some degree, the new library was a victim of its own success.

59:34.123 --> 59:40.751
Officials say the problems are temporary, but our digital shelf space for new books is already anticipated.

59:41.512 --> 59:43.694
Where are they going to put them?

59:43.714 --> 59:48.520
More importantly, where are the books for the next 20 years if they promised us when they gave the money?

59:49.023 --> 59:53.568
They haven't got room for the books they have, never mind buying anything for the next 20 years.

59:53.608 --> 59:56.011
Now, how is that going to work?

59:56.031 --> 59:59.395
Especially when this was supposed to be twice as big as the old library.

59:59.435 --> 01:00:01.157
It turns out it's actually smaller.

01:00:02.318 --> 01:00:08.965
It's 179,000 square feet of book space.

01:00:09.146 --> 01:00:13.591
Architects Simon and Freed have been realized.

01:00:13.611 --> 01:00:16.033
This is a building from the 21st century.

01:00:16.053 --> 01:00:18.456
They're walking because the site reflects market seats.

01:00:18.875 --> 01:00:32.324
which is right at the corner, and thereby reflects also the idea that the building is a building for the next millennium, building for the future, both with a foot in the past and a vision of the future.

01:00:32.344 --> 01:00:34.909
A new building, even a beautiful one.
