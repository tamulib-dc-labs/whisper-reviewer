WEBVTT

00:02.528 --> 00:06.613
Let's see, where were we?

00:07.514 --> 00:09.177
We're talking about your book.

00:09.837 --> 00:12.260
Playback to the last sentence.

00:12.841 --> 00:29.903
The German antiquarian book business was decimated by, first of all, the Nazis themselves, who, of course, were...

00:30.440 --> 00:53.980
sort of know-nothings and anti-culturalists, then by the immigration of the Jews, then by the bombing during the war, occupation, and then misery and no money for years.

00:54.360 --> 00:59.805
And then as we know also how the Russians, the Soviets also took all the books, anything that was left,

00:59.954 --> 01:02.318
Yeah, a lot, a lot.

01:02.438 --> 01:06.125
They actually emptied out libraries, which we didn't do.

01:06.145 --> 01:19.549
But anyway, still, but to my great surprise, I found out from a book, an auctioneer in Munich, Mr. Hartung, who is now 81, I believe,

01:20.609 --> 01:26.595
They had book auctions in Munich in the 1940s, still, while the bombs were falling down.

01:27.035 --> 01:29.477
They still had auctions in Munich, yes.

01:29.658 --> 01:31.639
Who was going to them?

01:31.659 --> 01:34.082
People continued to buy books.

01:34.863 --> 01:36.684
Who was this man, Hartung?

01:36.764 --> 01:39.367
Hartung, H-A-R-T-U-N-G.

01:39.407 --> 01:50.177
And if you go to Germany, perhaps you could interview him, because he's got a long memory, and he also remembers my grandfather, Hartung, where his

01:50.512 --> 01:53.456
Hans, I believe, and his son is Felix.

01:53.857 --> 01:56.260
I'll give you the exact... Okay, and where are they, in Germany?

01:56.420 --> 01:56.941
In Munich.

01:59.364 --> 01:59.585
Okay, good.

01:59.605 --> 02:01.648
Yeah, because Germany will be, I will be going to Germany.

02:01.668 --> 02:04.672
Yes, and they, they, uh... Do they speak English, I hope?

02:05.653 --> 02:07.756
Yes, most of them do.

02:07.776 --> 02:18.932
Then, um, there was a wonderful man in Munich who, a former employee of my grandfather, Jacques, uh, by the name of Helmut, H-E-L-M-U-T,

02:20.380 --> 02:32.892
Domizlaff, D-O-M-I-Z-L-A-F-F, Helmut Domizlaff in Munich, who was a bookseller who never issued a catalogue in his life.

02:34.553 --> 02:46.945
He was more of a collector than a bookseller, but when I came back to Munich after the war to visit him, he remembered me, you know, in lederhosen and golden locks and, uh,

02:47.617 --> 02:50.320
There was an immediate rapport established with him.

02:50.400 --> 03:01.290
He was absolutely untouched by Nazism.

03:01.430 --> 03:14.502
He was one of those people about whom you needn't have the slightest suspicion that they in any way collaborated or were Nazis or anything.

03:14.954 --> 03:33.477
He suffered a great deal because he was a very sensitive man, very intellectual, and thank God he was drafted into the German army, and somebody succeeded in having him assigned to some typing pool in Bavaria during the war.

03:34.178 --> 03:43.189
He was the first bookseller with whom we took up contact again.

03:46.004 --> 03:51.633
I'll tell you a nice anecdote, but this I think would be better if you didn't quote it.

03:52.935 --> 03:55.700
He knew me extremely well, as I said.

03:55.880 --> 04:03.432
And one day he said, you know, Bernhard, he was one of the few people whom I allowed to use the H in the name.

04:03.452 --> 04:06.898
He said, let me tell you something about your grandfather Jacques.

04:07.115 --> 04:10.558
He said, I think he was an anti-Semite.

04:11.539 --> 04:12.360
So I said, oh.

04:12.921 --> 04:13.301
He said, yes.

04:13.341 --> 04:20.688
He said, he never had a Jewish employee in a trade where, after all, there are so many Jews.

04:21.649 --> 04:23.270
And so we had a good laugh about that.

04:24.832 --> 04:25.312
And it's true.

04:25.673 --> 04:25.993
It's true.

04:26.173 --> 04:29.316
Never had a Jewish employee.

04:29.336 --> 04:29.977
That doesn't matter.

04:29.997 --> 04:30.818
That goes very deep.

04:30.998 --> 04:35.282
I think that has all to do with the German Jews trying to

04:35.870 --> 04:36.571
Assimilate.

04:36.652 --> 04:37.854
I don't think it's relevant.

04:38.115 --> 04:42.644
No, but it also shows you the openness and the friendship that we had.

04:42.704 --> 04:44.087
And Domitsev died, unfortunately.

04:44.507 --> 04:47.774
Before I interrupt you, Hartung was telling you about the bombs falling.

04:47.894 --> 04:50.460
Yes, but that's all I know.

04:50.540 --> 04:55.650
And I wanted, unfortunately, we didn't have much time, and I wanted him to tell me more, but he showed me some catalogs.

04:56.120 --> 05:00.168
So there was something, there was some trade going on.

05:00.368 --> 05:04.336
There was still this passion for books while the bombs were falling.

05:04.356 --> 05:12.773
I see this chapter opening, it might change a thousand times, but I will try and get some contemporary accounts of these book burnings in Germany.

05:13.575 --> 05:17.723
You want to talk about setting a scene and moving into it.

05:17.888 --> 05:21.852
have these, you talk about the... 1935 was the first book.

05:21.912 --> 05:24.174
There are accounts and people... Oh, yes.

05:24.254 --> 05:28.497
I think I would just try and set that scene very visually and take it from there.

05:28.638 --> 05:31.520
You can either go back and forth.

05:31.540 --> 05:35.363
You have to set the scene for what's about to happen.

05:36.044 --> 05:37.065
Quite a job.

05:37.766 --> 05:38.566
Pretend you're a writer.

05:38.586 --> 05:39.187
That's okay.

05:39.607 --> 05:41.669
You'll do it.

05:42.029 --> 05:44.512
I said that as much for my benefit there because I just thought of it.

05:45.152 --> 05:46.373
I see.

05:46.393 --> 05:47.254
Also in England.

05:48.010 --> 05:50.495
I mean, just because there were some bombs dropping in London.

05:51.336 --> 05:57.868
I mean, my brother, Albie, who started his business in 1936 in London.

05:58.490 --> 05:58.870
Albie?

05:59.331 --> 05:59.992
A-L-B-I.

06:00.353 --> 06:03.579
Well, his name is Albrecht, but it's untranslatable.

06:03.599 --> 06:05.202
It's not Albert.

06:05.403 --> 06:08.348
And everybody called him Albie practically from the day he was born.

06:09.053 --> 06:14.239
And so, and it's now official and has been for, really, 75 years, I think.

06:14.439 --> 06:17.863
So anyway, and Albie is... This is an older brother.

06:18.223 --> 06:19.124
Yeah.

06:19.144 --> 06:21.988
He's, yeah, he'll be 81 this year.

06:24.130 --> 06:27.494
Still full of beans and growing great guns.

06:27.814 --> 06:29.116
And he's still working, opening?

06:29.136 --> 06:29.516
Oh, yes.

06:29.796 --> 06:30.757
Oh, yes, very much so.

06:30.777 --> 06:31.318
Very much so.

06:31.338 --> 06:33.981
Yes, he is the music dealer, the world's...

06:34.366 --> 06:37.910
most recognized dealer in music, expert in music.

06:37.930 --> 06:39.372
Maybe he'd like to talk to me as well.

06:39.753 --> 06:40.354
I'm sure.

06:40.374 --> 06:52.389
I keep telling him to do something and to write down, because he knew people that, for instance, he could give you a whole thing about the people in England, the Germans who went to England.

06:52.729 --> 06:53.710
You'll tell me how to get in touch with him.

06:53.851 --> 06:54.571
I certainly will.

06:54.752 --> 06:55.272
I certainly will.

06:55.373 --> 06:57.055
And maybe you can pin him down.

06:58.416 --> 07:00.239
He was interviewed by these Germans, too.

07:00.259 --> 07:01.220
I'll send him a copy of my book.

07:01.240 --> 07:02.441
That's how we start.

07:02.461 --> 07:02.922
Okay.

07:03.290 --> 07:06.193
Okay, but I talk to him practically every day.

07:06.233 --> 07:13.801
But this guy who wrote this book would love to talk to him when I come to England, which he'll be sometime within the next time.

07:13.841 --> 07:15.203
He makes the papers all the time.

07:15.663 --> 07:21.209
He's a self-taught musicologist.

07:21.309 --> 07:27.075
He's a good violinist, a self-taught musicologist, and he deals in rare music, chiefly.

07:27.215 --> 07:30.799
But anyway, he started his business in London in 1936,

07:31.437 --> 07:38.724
And he was bombed out, came to work one day, and the wall of the building was missing.

07:39.765 --> 07:51.095
But the books, strangely enough, were still there, and they allowed him to go up on the rickety stairs and to save the books.

07:51.956 --> 07:55.439
And then he moved to Oxford and continued.

07:55.459 --> 07:58.122
I mean, you know, what's a few bombs?

07:58.462 --> 08:00.364
He's both, but he lives in Oxford.

08:00.985 --> 08:03.569
and has been living in Oxford since the 1940s.

08:03.689 --> 08:09.498
And I used to go and see him, and I was in the most beautiful towns in the world.

08:09.518 --> 08:13.784
Yes, when I was a GI, I was stationed in England for a while, and I'd go see him all the time.

08:14.825 --> 08:23.198
We made a strange pair, you know, he was this typical English civilian, and I was an American private uniform.

08:23.218 --> 08:24.540
I wouldn't think we were brothers.

08:25.140 --> 08:28.225
Anyway, so...

08:29.470 --> 08:37.679
But, of course, in England, the bombings were not as bad as what the Germans got.

08:39.241 --> 08:50.094
And so, as I say, the German antiquarian book market was a desert or a heap of rubble like the cities.

08:51.475 --> 08:55.680
And I think it's incredible how they managed to...

08:57.382 --> 08:59.926
somehow rebuild this business.

09:00.026 --> 09:01.609
It took 50 or 60 years, though, didn't it?

09:01.629 --> 09:06.517
Well, yes, it took them a long time to get a ten shirt, but that has to do with the currency also.

09:06.557 --> 09:12.046
But they had, also in the 50s already, there were some very remarkable booksellers in Germany.

09:12.086 --> 09:17.675
Domitschlaff, of course, was the most important one, and he was the first president of the German association.

09:17.715 --> 09:18.637
How would you spell his name?

09:19.197 --> 09:21.641
Domitschlaff, D-O-M-I-Z-L-A.

09:21.762 --> 09:22.903
He's the fellow that I mentioned.

09:22.984 --> 09:24.486
Yeah, Helmut, yeah.

09:25.563 --> 09:52.448
And so they had him, then they had some other people who, of course, worked under very difficult circumstances, but then the German universities and institutions all of a sudden got infusions of money again, and it's quite remarkable how they managed.

09:54.301 --> 09:57.306
It used to be that if you wanted to buy incunables, you went to Germany.

09:58.768 --> 10:04.718
Well, now it's the Germans who go to England to sort of restock.

10:05.279 --> 10:07.903
And a lot of stuff is going back.

10:07.943 --> 10:20.443
And that's incidentally a chapter which is, I think, very difficult to put your fingers on, but the flow of material back to Europe and to Japan.

10:20.592 --> 10:21.974
Well, this is essential.

10:22.294 --> 10:23.456
It is tremendous.

10:23.857 --> 10:24.317
Tremendous.

10:24.397 --> 10:33.731
I mean, I sell... If I have a really fine German item that is not represented in a German library, it'll be bought by a German library.

10:35.052 --> 10:36.154
Oh, yes, absolutely.

10:36.635 --> 10:40.019
And they will be fierce in their... Oh, yes, in their competition.

10:40.080 --> 10:40.781
Yes, indeed.

10:41.361 --> 10:42.563
And so are the Italians.

10:43.184 --> 10:45.707
You see what happened with his Leonardo da Vinci notebook.

10:45.728 --> 10:46.669
I was there.

10:46.689 --> 10:47.170
That's right.

10:47.190 --> 10:47.730
I was there.

10:47.931 --> 10:48.912
Yes, yes, yes.

10:49.482 --> 10:52.065
I mean, you know, that's a lot of money.

10:52.085 --> 10:53.927
They came prepared to spend $25 million.

10:53.947 --> 10:54.347
That's right.

10:54.728 --> 10:55.048
That's right.

10:55.068 --> 10:57.190
They just didn't know they were going up against Bill Gates.

10:57.891 --> 10:58.091
Right.

10:58.171 --> 10:58.692
Nobody knew.

10:58.892 --> 10:59.533
Nobody knew.

10:59.553 --> 11:01.054
Not even Steve Massey.

11:01.114 --> 11:01.475
He didn't.

11:01.495 --> 11:04.838
I was the one who questioned him at the press conference after the sale.

11:05.239 --> 11:06.040
Yeah, you.

11:06.821 --> 11:10.304
That's not in the book, but I questioned him.

11:10.324 --> 11:15.610
And his superior said, all I can tell you is that it's a quarter.

11:16.391 --> 11:16.951
And that was that.

11:17.352 --> 11:18.373
But then the story broke.

11:18.433 --> 11:19.354
It's not a collector.

11:20.212 --> 11:22.855
Well, he's not a collector, but why do you suppose he bought it?

11:22.875 --> 11:29.284
Okay, I have to start with one of Barney Rosenthal's great predictions.

11:29.484 --> 11:31.266
I made a number of such predictions.

11:31.927 --> 11:33.690
People would say, what do you think it'll bring?

11:33.730 --> 11:35.372
They'd say, I'll tell you, it won't sell.

11:36.473 --> 11:44.464
Because, yes, I was convinced that this would not sell, because obviously it must have had a reserve of about $10 million.

11:44.984 --> 11:48.649
And I said, there is no collector in the world that I know

11:48.832 --> 11:53.236
that is willing to spend $10 million for a book, for this book.

11:53.256 --> 11:56.379
And I was right, because this was not a collector.

11:56.399 --> 12:00.804
This was an intelligent, wealthy individual who knew what this was all about.

12:01.124 --> 12:03.706
Neither were the Italian bankers, collectors.

12:03.726 --> 12:04.687
They just wanted for Italy.

12:04.988 --> 12:06.729
And I thought this acting won't sell.

12:06.749 --> 12:13.836
I was standing there with Bart Orbeck, and who walks by, but Lou Weinstein.

12:13.896 --> 12:14.196
Yes.

12:14.317 --> 12:17.079
So I said, OK, Lou, what's it going to go for?

12:17.239 --> 12:17.860
He was leaving.

12:18.430 --> 12:22.794
He says, oh, 10.5, he says, 10.5 million.

12:22.814 --> 12:28.660
And he's standing right there five minutes later, $28 million, $30.5 million.

12:30.102 --> 12:31.463
So much for experts.

12:32.024 --> 12:35.467
And the advances were in million-dollar increments.

12:35.487 --> 12:35.867
Yeah, imagine that.

12:35.887 --> 12:40.192
For a 72-page book, a beautiful, and it's more than a book, of course.

12:40.272 --> 12:42.334
It's a unique manuscript.

12:42.354 --> 12:46.598
But how do you explain, then, that the Louisiana Purchase,

12:48.080 --> 12:50.584
Didn't find a buyer for a million dollars.

12:51.385 --> 13:01.159
And as Hanni Krauss said, and we were talking, because that was the day before the sale, she said, you know, Barney, for this country, that's much more important than the Leonardo da Vinci manuscript.

13:01.259 --> 13:04.543
And somehow, she was right.

13:04.724 --> 13:07.067
I mean, it didn't find a buyer.

13:07.300 --> 13:09.483
It was bought by Jefferson.

13:10.484 --> 13:13.529
Yeah, and they gave him hell for spending so much money.

13:13.549 --> 13:13.989
That's right.

13:14.029 --> 13:18.075
No, but I mean this Louisiana Purchase document at Christie's.

13:18.095 --> 13:21.380
Oh, I think I'm talking about that.

13:21.420 --> 13:21.780
Oh, I see.

13:21.900 --> 13:25.966
Okay, this document, the Louisiana Purchase document at Christie's.

13:26.006 --> 13:26.547
That didn't sell?

13:26.807 --> 13:27.388
That was bought in?

13:27.408 --> 13:29.591
It was bought in, and then I have to know that it was bought in.

13:29.671 --> 13:31.053
I didn't know what you were talking about there.

13:31.073 --> 13:31.814
Oh, I see.

13:31.854 --> 13:33.296
I've been in a fade here.

13:33.316 --> 13:33.797
That didn't...

13:33.777 --> 13:55.313
that was that was the engelhardt document yes is that what you're talking about that was brought in it was bought in but it was then sold it was then sold and you can ask steve massey i don't want to say i know but uh if he wants to reveal it but it was bought by a couple of dealers yeah yeah speculation then whatever yeah

13:56.204 --> 13:59.487
Would you know what they paid for it, off the record?

13:59.507 --> 14:03.951
Off the record, $750,000, including commission.

14:05.092 --> 14:05.693
How could that?

14:06.774 --> 14:08.935
The document that opened the West.

14:11.538 --> 14:13.720
How is that possible?

14:13.980 --> 14:15.842
See, that's a very interesting point.

14:15.862 --> 14:18.324
Why is that, do you figure?

14:18.344 --> 14:21.867
Why wouldn't the Smithsonian Institution try to get it?

14:21.887 --> 14:26.211
I thought that this should bring between $5 and $10 million.

14:27.389 --> 14:30.354
Maybe because there's another copy in the archive somewhere.

14:30.414 --> 14:30.975
I don't know.

14:31.515 --> 14:33.498
Well, is it a printed thing?

14:33.559 --> 14:34.760
No, no, no.

14:34.800 --> 14:35.982
A lot of it is manuscript.

14:36.663 --> 14:37.845
So it's the actual document.

14:37.865 --> 14:40.850
Yeah, it's the actual document, or maybe an official copy of something.

14:40.870 --> 14:45.257
I don't have the... But it's a fantastic Americana.

14:46.418 --> 14:50.084
And, uh... Yeah, it's amazing.

14:50.184 --> 14:51.506
I don't know where we're going on that.

14:51.947 --> 14:52.688
So, anyway.

14:53.140 --> 14:54.081
Yeah.

14:54.381 --> 15:03.230
So, in a way, you see, Gates is not a collector, I think, in that sense, or a bibliophile.

15:03.270 --> 15:04.171
Oh, he's certainly not.

15:04.331 --> 15:05.332
I'm sure that he collects.

15:05.352 --> 15:06.113
No, no, no, he's not.

15:06.834 --> 15:13.140
But he's gathering things, and what his intentions are, are really very, nobody knows.

15:13.340 --> 15:14.702
Yeah, right.

15:14.722 --> 15:17.044
I think it's part of this, he's digitized.

15:17.064 --> 15:18.345
He bought the Bettman Archive.

15:18.405 --> 15:19.326
Yes.

15:20.187 --> 15:23.130
I told you I'm going to be seeing Otto next month.

15:23.363 --> 15:24.224
Very interesting.

15:24.364 --> 15:24.884
I called him.

15:24.904 --> 15:26.326
He must be a remarkable guy.

15:26.346 --> 15:29.689
Yes, he sounds so lucid and clear, and he's in a retirement home.

15:29.969 --> 15:31.110
Yeah.

15:31.190 --> 15:32.671
And I said, what day is good?

15:32.691 --> 15:34.913
He says, I'm here all the time.

15:35.134 --> 15:35.594
He's coming.

15:35.794 --> 15:36.054
Right.

15:36.155 --> 15:38.016
I'm looking forward to your arrival.

15:39.157 --> 15:39.257
Yeah.

15:39.277 --> 15:45.543
But, you know, he was a special collections librarian and lip-sig, I guess.

15:45.563 --> 15:45.803
Really?

15:46.044 --> 15:46.464
Yeah.

15:46.484 --> 15:47.765
I don't know his background at all.

15:47.785 --> 15:51.008
Well, I just started looking it up, and so he's going to have a

15:52.068 --> 15:53.930
He'll fit in later in the book.

15:53.950 --> 15:58.074
You know, you do hundreds of interviews, and then they kind of walk around.

15:58.354 --> 16:08.303
You know what is amazing about the, I think I also say that somewhere, but it's worth emphasizing how none of the bookseaters went back.

16:08.884 --> 16:09.765
You know, they could have.

16:09.985 --> 16:18.493
I mean, these refugees who came here, they would have been received in open arms in Germany, and probably would have also had government subsidies and all that.

16:20.174 --> 16:20.775
They all stayed.

16:20.975 --> 16:23.278
Well, they'd made a new life, hadn't they?

16:23.298 --> 16:23.759
Yeah, that's right.

16:23.779 --> 16:24.740
And it was agreeable.

16:25.180 --> 16:27.063
Yeah.

16:27.083 --> 16:27.704
And life went on.

16:27.964 --> 16:33.872
But also, amid the rubble, the booksellers, their businesses were destroyed.

16:34.412 --> 16:41.522
Didn't this also open up extraordinary opportunities to bring material to the states and stuff for the emigres?

16:41.742 --> 16:42.863
I mean, they still knew where to go.

16:42.883 --> 16:45.767
And people desperately needed money to sell material.

16:46.372 --> 16:51.138
I think, without mentioning any names, I think some of them took advantage of that.

16:51.258 --> 16:56.124
They went to Germany and bought things for cartons of cigarettes.

16:56.144 --> 17:07.097
But that didn't last very long, because the German dealers were, of course, totally cut off from the international market and had no idea about international prices.

17:08.018 --> 17:13.425
And so a lot could be bought very cheaply, indeed.

17:13.726 --> 17:21.860
However, it was also a time, you have to think, that in the 40s, it wasn't so easy to sell an early continental book in this country, yet.

17:24.284 --> 17:29.092
Now, we're talking about institutions as well as private collectors that are buying, right?

17:29.112 --> 17:29.412
Indeed.

17:30.134 --> 17:35.723
And what do you think prompted this interest, finally, in this country and this material?

17:37.326 --> 17:38.808
Just that mainly that it was available?

17:39.109 --> 17:39.970
I mean, I wonder.

17:41.367 --> 17:50.117
Well, I think that library schools turned out more sophisticated librarians.

17:50.137 --> 18:03.914
I think that some of the European academics who were teaching here got their librarians to get this material.

18:06.076 --> 18:07.678
And maybe a lot of these are

18:08.688 --> 18:11.271
Librarians and curators were also people who edited them.

18:11.291 --> 18:12.652
Not a lot of them, but some of them were.

18:14.254 --> 18:31.793
One of the main examples of that would be Rudolf Hirsch, H-I-R-S-C-H, who was the son of a famous German bookseller, Emil Hirsch, who also came here

18:40.261 --> 18:43.464
Yeah, there is Emil Hirsch from Munich.

18:43.484 --> 18:55.716
And Emil Hirsch's son, Rudolf, became a librarian, first at the New York Public and then at the University of Pennsylvania, very influential.

18:55.857 --> 19:03.624
For instance, he bought lots of medieval manuscripts and continental 15th and 16th century books.

19:06.828 --> 19:10.251
But he is sort of

19:11.311 --> 19:14.234
the only obvious examples I can think of.

19:16.817 --> 19:21.441
Think of how this strengthens American institutions, though.

19:21.461 --> 19:24.945
And Roger says, you know, our stuff is as good as anybody's now.

19:26.106 --> 19:27.127
And it's an interesting statement.

19:27.147 --> 19:30.290
Of course, Harvard, you know.

19:31.271 --> 19:37.858
They were blessed by a succession of librarians and donors that were just

19:38.007 --> 19:43.473
Every one of them exceptional, including Roger, who is really an exceptional person.

19:44.133 --> 19:55.044
And, you know, I have seldom seen a librarian, if ever, that has this kind of encyclopedic knowledge that he has.

19:56.186 --> 19:56.906
He knows everything.

19:56.946 --> 19:57.687
It's disgusting.

19:58.248 --> 20:01.731
I usually see him every six months or so.

20:02.552 --> 20:03.854
And he'll listen to me.

20:03.894 --> 20:05.015
And he'll just listen.

20:05.695 --> 20:06.276
Then he'll get up.

20:06.863 --> 20:09.127
get a book and read it down, and try to get a look at that.

20:09.407 --> 20:14.375
Of course, it's exactly what you write more, and it's telling you something you absolutely didn't know.

20:14.416 --> 20:18.342
It's almost embarrassing, you know?

20:18.362 --> 20:32.145
Well, and I think that also, possibly, that after World War II, America became more of an international and European, Europe-oriented power.

20:32.682 --> 20:35.206
and I think Fulbright scholarships.

20:35.506 --> 20:48.185
When you think of all this tremendous flow back and forth of people coming here from Europe and Americans going to Europe to study and all that, that probably also must have had some kind of influence on this.

20:48.205 --> 20:58.420
Largely, this deals with institutional collections, I guess, but are there any private collectors you can think of whose collections really became spectacular by virtue of this?

21:00.803 --> 21:01.845
Well, yes.

21:02.281 --> 21:05.145
Um, one of them is Kim Brooker in Chicago.

21:05.165 --> 21:05.826
Oh, for sure.

21:05.846 --> 21:07.468
I don't know who he is.

21:07.489 --> 21:10.853
But Kim, of course, let's see, he came to see me— But he's more recent now.

21:11.074 --> 21:11.835
He's more recent.

21:11.855 --> 21:14.679
He came to see me in New York when I just began in the 1950s.

21:14.999 --> 21:16.902
He came to see you in the 50s.

21:21.669 --> 21:25.515
Yes, he came to see me in the late 50s.

21:26.596 --> 21:30.702
Uh, but he was already then a collector.

21:31.137 --> 21:32.739
I would have to think about it.

21:32.859 --> 21:42.430
I think that, for instance, another collector in Chicago, Abel Berland.

21:42.470 --> 21:43.752
I'm seeing him.

21:43.792 --> 21:45.854
I'm talking to the Caxton Club out there.

21:45.915 --> 21:46.415
Are you?

21:46.435 --> 21:47.176
In May.

21:47.256 --> 21:47.516
Good.

21:47.757 --> 21:48.738
He was the one who invited me.

21:49.078 --> 21:49.579
You asked him.

21:49.639 --> 21:50.840
He wanted me to come see his books.

21:51.261 --> 21:53.644
You've got something.

21:53.664 --> 21:55.085
Do you know Chef Louis Zafmari?

21:56.187 --> 21:56.908
He's in my book.

21:57.188 --> 21:57.588
Who is that?

21:57.709 --> 21:59.811
Chef Louis Zafmari, the chef.

22:00.230 --> 22:00.610
Oh.

22:00.791 --> 22:01.251
The bakery.

22:01.271 --> 22:03.954
You probably wouldn't know him, but he's in my book.

22:03.974 --> 22:04.514
You'll see him.

22:04.554 --> 22:05.075
I don't want to.

22:05.095 --> 22:09.559
I'm curious to read your chapter on Manny, which I have now.

22:09.759 --> 22:19.649
Anyway, but Abel, well, I want to compare the two because as far as I know, I never sold Manny anything.

22:20.730 --> 22:21.391
There it is.

22:22.352 --> 22:24.454
Two hundred and fifty cents.

22:24.474 --> 22:27.637
Okay, we're talking what, Burlington?

22:27.657 --> 22:28.718
Come on now, are you working?

22:30.031 --> 22:51.921
Go ahead, you spoke to a class of Terry Bell and just... Yeah, and I emphasize the fact that, you know, this... This is a Lucien Goldschmidt lecture, which is a little bit too much like, you know...

22:52.407 --> 22:56.173
the good old days, but then, this is my little autobiographical search.

22:56.393 --> 22:56.854
Okay.

22:56.874 --> 22:58.156
This is running again, so go ahead.

22:58.176 --> 23:00.679
I think maybe there's a little bump on the tape.

23:01.481 --> 23:05.747
I can't think of any, well, of course, Rosenwald.

23:05.767 --> 23:15.141
If you talk about really major collectors, there must have been quite a few that were, you know,

23:15.442 --> 23:20.189
How about people like Otto Schaeffer and people like that in Europe?

23:21.010 --> 23:26.638
Well, Otto Schaeffer, of course, Breslauer was one of his main suppliers.

23:28.601 --> 23:30.103
But that's a different chapter now.

23:30.563 --> 23:31.685
That's over there, yeah.

23:31.725 --> 23:33.147
Right, yeah.
