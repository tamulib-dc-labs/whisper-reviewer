WEBVTT

00:03.001 --> 00:09.329
and tell me about the night.

00:09.509 --> 00:14.015
How does... I mean, you've written so many different things.

00:14.095 --> 00:19.161
I mean, my wife drove in with me and said, you know, look at the books that this guy's written.

00:19.502 --> 00:32.738
Well, this is my big problem as a writer, because, you know, that if you can kind of do something so that you create an audience for that one thing, so...

00:33.005 --> 00:38.971
Everyone knows it's a King C. Amos or it's a Le CarrÃ©.

00:39.432 --> 00:40.813
You know, you've got a built-in audience.

00:41.394 --> 00:45.598
But my thing is, my problem has always been that I can't get interested in subjects.

00:45.879 --> 00:50.544
I mean, I don't want to do the same thing again, you know.

00:50.564 --> 01:01.155
This is... This has got the... It started, you know, all... My...

01:03.329 --> 01:22.998
The mission has been always to take these rather difficult subjects like suicide, divorce, and so on, but then to deal with them as though they were kind of part of life rather than abstract subjects, so that I'm there.

01:23.078 --> 01:28.105
Because usually, you know, I might as well kind of play to my own mind with that.

01:29.097 --> 01:32.100
Are they, in your view, abstractions when you start with that one?

01:32.200 --> 01:35.043
Well, not really, but they're kind of complicated subjects, you know.

01:35.063 --> 01:36.865
You can't really put your arms around the night.

01:37.025 --> 01:37.606
Exactly.

01:37.766 --> 01:44.833
Well, as I say in the book, the trouble with night is that it really was like one of those cone juice handkerchiefs, you know.

01:44.874 --> 01:48.137
You know, you pull the blue, you know, it's got a blue one coming out of the top.

01:48.157 --> 01:51.040
You pull it, there's a red one, there's a yellow one, there's a green one.

01:51.060 --> 01:53.923
You know, it just went on and on and on and on and on.

01:54.072 --> 01:57.977
Did you expect that it would be a four-year inquiry?

01:58.138 --> 01:59.339
I mean, you mentioned four years.

01:59.379 --> 02:00.761
I said, Jesus Christ, that's a lot.

02:01.022 --> 02:02.444
That's a long time.

02:02.464 --> 02:06.129
11 years in mind, but I knew it was a marathon going into it, you know?

02:06.810 --> 02:09.513
In a way, I could have gone on forever with this.

02:09.654 --> 02:10.475
That's the other thing.

02:10.635 --> 02:13.038
I'll tell you something interesting.

02:13.058 --> 02:16.924
That is that a lot of the time, my books always get shorter.

02:17.945 --> 02:19.087
Is that right?

02:19.287 --> 02:21.430
Yeah, I kind of...

02:22.118 --> 02:24.561
I'm a great believer in kind of making it clear.

02:25.061 --> 02:27.484
You know, if you can say it, you can say it clearly.

02:27.504 --> 02:28.986
You don't have to.

02:29.106 --> 02:30.828
But that takes time, you know.

02:30.848 --> 02:32.910
It takes away a lot of the writing.

02:34.012 --> 02:41.540
And it started my initial involvement.

02:41.560 --> 02:47.467
It was quite simply that I got kind of totally hooked on sleep.

02:47.747 --> 02:50.170
You mean the pleasure of it?

02:50.190 --> 02:50.991
The pleasure of it.

02:51.011 --> 02:52.092
Yeah, I just loved it.

02:52.342 --> 02:54.144
And then, of course, it's very mysterious.

02:54.184 --> 02:58.890
You start looking at sleep, and then it becomes a very mysterious subject.

02:59.691 --> 03:05.499
Pardon me, but even as you've gotten older, the appreciation for him has made it.

03:05.559 --> 03:11.827
Yeah, I do not believe what they tell you about the old get-by with less sleep.

03:11.847 --> 03:14.210
I'm now 65.

03:14.230 --> 03:19.016
So I started this when I was up in 59.

03:19.116 --> 03:21.239
All I ever wanted to do was sleep.

03:21.259 --> 03:21.960
Not altogether.

03:22.210 --> 03:28.340
Because the other thing is that I'm also a very key poker player.

03:28.360 --> 03:31.085
For someone who's obsessed with sleep, I don't get a lot older.

03:31.806 --> 03:35.612
Yeah, but now, see, do you take naps?

03:35.632 --> 03:36.694
Do you take naps?

03:36.714 --> 03:36.814
Yeah.

03:36.894 --> 03:37.616
I love naps.

03:37.636 --> 03:39.078
I thrive on them.

03:39.318 --> 03:39.980
Yeah.

03:40.060 --> 03:45.028
I love having my wife drive me in, even, because going back, I'll take ten minutes in the car.

03:45.168 --> 03:45.889
That's wonderful.

03:45.929 --> 03:47.492
Yeah, if you can do it, it's marvelous.

03:47.573 --> 03:49.557
And you mentioned wartime experiences.

03:49.677 --> 03:58.014
I know I was on an aircraft carrier in Vietnam, and I literally lived immediately beneath the catapults.

03:58.094 --> 04:00.358
And the O2 level was in light.

04:00.479 --> 04:01.801
I was the one in the O2, O3.

04:01.821 --> 04:04.266
I mean, you learn to sleep through this stuff.

04:04.533 --> 04:05.535
You can sleep well.

04:05.575 --> 04:06.356
You can sleep well.

04:06.417 --> 04:12.087
I cannot sleep standing up, but I can sleep sitting down in a movie theater, in a lecture.

04:12.107 --> 04:12.548
Oh, yeah.

04:12.568 --> 04:16.035
On an airplane, cars, clock band, anywhere, anywhere.

04:16.375 --> 04:19.521
And I can do it for five minutes and feel wonderfully refreshed.

04:19.562 --> 04:20.924
You do feel much better.

04:20.944 --> 04:22.988
People don't understand that, do they?

04:23.048 --> 04:23.990
There's churches.

04:24.471 --> 04:25.613
The thing is huge.

04:26.217 --> 04:32.787
Church was one of those guys that got by with no sleep, but he had pan-maps all the time.

04:32.827 --> 04:35.551
They do rejuvenate you, and they shut you up.

04:36.292 --> 04:38.996
But of course, let's connect that with the night now.

04:39.016 --> 04:41.279
I mean, I guess what we're saying is I can sleep.

04:42.361 --> 04:47.308
I don't have to close the windows or anything like that.

04:47.328 --> 04:48.850
It's not necessarily a night.

04:49.454 --> 04:53.158
No, it's not necessarily an eye activity, but it tends to be an eye activity.

04:53.178 --> 04:57.503
Even the animals go crazy during a quip.

04:57.623 --> 04:57.943
Oh, no.

04:58.684 --> 05:00.947
We're kind of rooted into this thing.

05:00.967 --> 05:17.925
The other thing, of course, is where I kind of went off, got really involved and spent a lot of time, was that it's very much, you start thinking about sleep and dreams and so on, then you get involved in how the brain works.

05:18.412 --> 05:22.338
And what you're really involved in is the question of mind.

05:22.418 --> 05:25.443
The whole way the mind works is to sleep from the brain.

05:26.104 --> 05:31.492
It's a very fascinating, very deep, complicated subject.

05:31.733 --> 05:31.893
Yeah.

05:32.414 --> 05:37.161
Do you find that... I mean, I know that I... This happens to me all the time, and I mean all the time.

05:37.622 --> 05:40.386
Let's say I'm wrestling with something, and I'm writing something, and I...

05:41.125 --> 05:45.232
Pardon me, I'll notice it.

05:45.252 --> 05:46.734
You didn't say pardon me to pardon me.

05:46.754 --> 05:49.659
And sometimes I'll wake up with the solution.

05:50.200 --> 05:50.540
Oh, yeah.

05:50.561 --> 05:51.202
Immediately.

05:51.262 --> 05:54.046
Well, that's what I... It's the words out, that's right.

05:54.928 --> 05:57.512
Or the word that's been escaping you for days.

05:57.532 --> 05:58.594
Sure, that's right, yeah.

05:58.614 --> 05:59.375
It's there, immediately.

05:59.475 --> 06:03.281
So I've misplaced something, and I wake up knowing precisely where it is.

06:03.302 --> 06:07.268
But you see, that's the whole point about, you know, what really...

06:07.990 --> 06:15.619
The thing that I absolutely had no idea of when I started was that I just assumed that, you know, that the mind shut down when you saw it.

06:15.999 --> 06:21.906
But in fact, you know, according to the neurophysiologist, it drops off five, maybe ten percent.

06:22.066 --> 06:26.512
You know, the mind's buzzing away, and you're just thinking in different terms.

06:26.992 --> 06:29.215
And you're thinking kind of visually.

06:30.656 --> 06:34.120
You know, you're thinking with the right hemisphere and on the left hemisphere.

06:34.501 --> 06:36.343
Did you see the review on today's New York Times?

06:37.015 --> 06:38.416
Oh, yes, the Sunday one.

06:39.157 --> 06:46.605
No, not of your book, but there are two books on dreams by Burroughs and Graham Greene that I reviewed and read them today.

06:47.126 --> 06:50.469
But maybe after the fact that it's our time, take a look at it.

06:50.589 --> 06:53.272
They did your book, I think.

06:53.292 --> 06:54.453
They did Leavenhof, did it?

06:54.574 --> 06:56.255
Yes, I actually did.

06:56.275 --> 06:59.058
And then the Sunday Times did it.

06:59.198 --> 07:01.221
It's a pain in the ass.

07:01.241 --> 07:02.522
But it was so pompous.

07:02.702 --> 07:05.385
I just thought she was on the...

07:05.838 --> 07:11.767
Tell me why you picked New York.

07:11.847 --> 07:12.248
New York.

07:12.268 --> 07:16.875
Because ever since I came to New York... Are the clubs different in New York than they are in London?

07:16.895 --> 07:20.160
I mean... Oh, shit, they are different.

07:20.180 --> 07:21.622
Boy, I mean, that's really something.

07:21.722 --> 07:23.324
I'll tell you one thing.

07:23.465 --> 07:33.199
The clubs in New York and London, both of whom have terribly bad press, you know, were absolutely terrific.

07:33.339 --> 07:35.102
I love New York.

07:35.183 --> 07:36.104
Yeah.

07:36.124 --> 07:38.308
I can't find anything wrong with it.

07:38.328 --> 07:39.269
Well, New York.

07:39.289 --> 07:40.411
Oh, no, New York itself.

07:40.431 --> 07:42.694
I was talking about the cops.

07:42.714 --> 07:43.816
The cops are just marvellous.

07:43.836 --> 07:45.959
They have this, oh, fucking job.

07:46.359 --> 07:50.886
I mean, you see, but beyond belief, you know, is stressful.

07:50.946 --> 08:00.280
You know, and they've got their faces in night, whatever the time of day is, all the time, they're right pressed into it.

08:00.732 --> 08:02.774
I think they keep sailing.

08:02.814 --> 08:03.635
They keep decent.

08:03.655 --> 08:07.320
And if they go off the rails sometimes, the miracle is that they go off the rails.

08:07.380 --> 08:13.727
Well, I don't know how long you've been in the States, but they say that the incidence of suicide... Very high.

08:13.788 --> 08:20.055
...New York Cops is like five times the national average, you know.

08:20.075 --> 08:28.545
Brother Lowe once said to me that if there was a little switch in your arm that you could flick bacteria in the light,

08:29.150 --> 08:30.615
to create suicide?

08:30.856 --> 08:31.277
Everyone.

08:31.498 --> 08:32.421
I don't think so.

08:32.762 --> 08:34.187
You think that?

08:34.207 --> 08:40.347
Because to me, the most ludicrous, it's almost an oxymoron is when you hear that somebody has attempted suicide.

08:40.367 --> 08:40.628
Yeah.

08:40.777 --> 08:42.519
That should be the easiest thing in the world to do.

08:42.539 --> 08:43.119
Oh, sure, of course.

08:43.300 --> 08:45.382
Absolutely, yeah.

08:45.402 --> 08:48.004
You know, I mean, she attempted a suicide fight.

08:48.024 --> 08:49.366
What do you mean, she attempted it?

08:49.386 --> 08:50.207
Why did she fail?

08:50.267 --> 08:51.388
How stupid can she be?

08:51.408 --> 08:53.170
I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:53.190 --> 08:55.852
I mean, aim the gun in your mouth or jump off a bridge.

08:55.913 --> 08:57.214
I mean, it should be very easy.

08:57.234 --> 08:57.694
Yeah, can't miss.

08:57.975 --> 08:59.236
You can't miss, absolutely.

08:59.256 --> 09:01.578
But what did you do to attempt, you know?

09:01.799 --> 09:03.300
You're the authority of it.

09:03.320 --> 09:03.801
Yeah, yeah.

09:03.821 --> 09:06.143
What happened then was that she swallowed it.

09:06.443 --> 09:10.249
Yeah, and then called the paramedics.

09:12.212 --> 09:16.258
You know, the boyfriend or whatever.

09:16.278 --> 09:19.542
You see, it's just bullshit, man.

09:19.562 --> 09:28.335
But no, my thing is, I came first to the United States of America in 1953, and it was through love at first sight.

09:28.496 --> 09:31.320
I've been crazy about America ever since.

09:31.340 --> 09:36.147
And I was at Princeton as a graduate student,

09:37.156 --> 09:40.400
But I was in New York a lot, and I just left New York.

09:40.980 --> 09:48.309
And what that, what that, beginning of that, cops actually, is kind of hidden to New York, really.

09:48.389 --> 09:50.632
Did you find riding with the cops at night?

09:50.652 --> 09:53.215
I mean, do the predators really come out at night?

09:53.235 --> 09:54.496
Oh, yeah.

09:55.638 --> 10:00.023
And this is kind of interesting, because they know that there's something you can do, you know.

10:00.363 --> 10:04.648
The drug dealers know that they can't,

10:05.641 --> 10:14.373
you know, just be, you know, they can't, there's nothing the cops can do unless they can actually get another, you know, in the middle of a deal, you know.

10:15.154 --> 10:20.641
And there's this kind of extraordinary sort of standoff thing that goes on.

10:20.942 --> 10:22.884
Do you like to walk at night in the city?

10:22.984 --> 10:27.090
Well, I've got this problem where I said something that I can't walk anymore, you know.

10:27.110 --> 10:29.493
I love to walk at night.

10:29.513 --> 10:31.756
I know it's dangerous, but I do it.

10:31.816 --> 10:34.720
But the other thing is that in the smaller hours,

10:35.155 --> 10:46.288
You know, cities really do change, but in some weird way, I mean, if you don't go into, you know, some crazy area, they become much more friendly.

10:46.308 --> 10:52.515
You know, it is as though there was some kind of club that Insomniacs belonged to, you know.

10:52.535 --> 10:56.760
Tell me about Las Vegas.

10:56.820 --> 10:58.262
You read my book on Vegas.

10:58.602 --> 10:59.523
Years ago.

10:59.704 --> 11:02.066
Yeah, that's my favorite book, actually.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.369
I love Vegas myself.

11:04.535 --> 11:05.697
Yeah.

11:05.717 --> 11:08.922
Atlantic City, as close as it is.

11:08.942 --> 11:10.324
You mean to the other one?

11:10.364 --> 11:11.325
You mean the Indians?

11:11.345 --> 11:12.347
The Indians are still close.

11:12.567 --> 11:13.068
Terrific.

11:13.168 --> 11:14.650
It's only an hour from where I live.

11:14.810 --> 11:15.391
Oh, really?

11:15.852 --> 11:16.513
It's too close.

11:16.593 --> 11:17.514
I'm a crapshoot.

11:17.634 --> 11:18.836
Oh, you're a crapshoot.

11:18.856 --> 11:19.437
Yeah, I don't.

11:19.457 --> 11:26.027
You see, I'm, I'm, I actually, I'm a very serious poker player.

11:26.067 --> 11:27.209
I know that.

11:27.229 --> 11:28.731
But I, I don't gamble.

11:28.791 --> 11:30.974
I don't, I play poker.

11:31.074 --> 11:32.196
I, I, I really,

11:32.530 --> 11:36.555
When I rode the big scale in town, I spent a month in Vegas here.

11:37.617 --> 11:44.265
And you know, when you're in Vegas, you cannot get out of your hotel without going through the casino, yeah?

11:44.285 --> 11:45.507
No clocks, no windows.

11:45.527 --> 11:46.528
No clocks, no windows.

11:46.929 --> 11:50.954
They pump oxygen in there, they can't use you up a little bit.

11:51.054 --> 11:53.297
That's what I might sit on the way.

11:53.317 --> 11:57.002
But the fact that I was, I never made a single best part for the military.

11:57.657 --> 12:00.622
No, because you take this, you poke it very seriously.

12:00.642 --> 12:03.526
Yeah, I love it.

12:04.047 --> 12:05.649
You don't shoot craps or anything?

12:05.770 --> 12:08.574
I tell you why I don't shoot craps.

12:08.594 --> 12:20.272
I have a pal, a Canadian, who's a poker-playing pal of mine, and he used to run when he was a kid.

12:20.573 --> 12:23.277
He ran an illegal craps game in Montreal.

12:24.168 --> 12:32.858
and he said, I'll teach you trance.

12:33.379 --> 12:34.740
Come with me, just do what I do.

12:35.021 --> 12:38.365
So we went out, and I did exactly what he did.

12:38.425 --> 12:38.945
Killed, right?

12:39.206 --> 12:42.149
No, he finished up winning, and I started losing.

12:42.169 --> 12:47.695
And I thought, there is some mystery here, but I cannot... Well, he was probably making a lot of playbacks.

12:47.735 --> 12:49.558
Yeah, I don't know.

12:49.858 --> 12:53.382
And I also think that because it's exciting and I'm an adrenaline chunk,

12:53.513 --> 12:54.033
Yeah.

12:54.053 --> 12:59.298
But it might, um, you know, I could get, I could see that it worked out.

12:59.318 --> 13:05.563
The thing of it is, what's scary is that, and it's not much fun, is that you can lose all your money in 90 seconds.

13:05.743 --> 13:07.245
I mean, it doesn't take long.

13:07.625 --> 13:11.868
Especially with, I mean, I like to play five, ten dollar tables.

13:11.968 --> 13:14.571
Who can afford $25 tables?

13:14.651 --> 13:15.231
I mean, sure.

13:15.371 --> 13:23.318
And of course, you don't want to just do the front line, you want to buy some numbers, you want to do some, that's, you've got 200 bucks out there or something, you know, one seven,

13:24.209 --> 13:26.211
You sand them out.

13:26.231 --> 13:28.233
I mean, they clean all those chips.

13:29.354 --> 13:31.496
If you bet no, that's boring.

13:31.516 --> 13:35.559
You're just waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting for the shooter, you know, to pull up seven.

13:35.839 --> 13:37.641
And you can really get killed on that as well.

13:37.661 --> 13:39.042
Can you get killed on that?

13:39.062 --> 13:39.243
Oh, yeah.

13:39.263 --> 13:40.724
I thought that's lucked in the old swing.

13:41.845 --> 13:43.406
No, I mean, you wait forever.

13:43.506 --> 13:47.250
I mean, and if you say, well, I think I'll bet with the shooter now.

13:47.270 --> 13:48.531
I mean, you always get it wrong.

13:48.631 --> 13:50.653
I mean, you have to make a decision.

13:50.693 --> 13:51.934
You know the whole way.

13:52.154 --> 13:54.216
I shouldn't report it.

13:55.563 --> 13:57.386
kill myself when I got to transcribe it.

13:58.007 --> 14:02.734
Are you familiar with the book that was published a couple months ago, The Primary Colors?

14:03.435 --> 14:04.156
No.

14:04.176 --> 14:06.439
By Alexander Theroux.

14:06.459 --> 14:06.519
No.

14:06.539 --> 14:07.541
And it's pretty interesting.

14:07.561 --> 14:11.587
I can see a similarity, I mean, with the treatment that you've done.

14:11.767 --> 14:17.075
But yours is, I respect, and we have the same editor, Alan Peacock, at Holtz.

14:18.437 --> 14:20.260
But I like what you've done a lot.

14:20.300 --> 14:21.722
Because you've involved yourself.

14:22.022 --> 14:22.583
You went out.

14:22.765 --> 14:23.906
I think you've got to.

14:23.926 --> 14:25.728
I think there's no point in doing a book.

14:26.268 --> 14:27.770
Again, it's reading stuff.

14:27.930 --> 14:29.171
I've read a book.

14:29.351 --> 14:32.093
Address yourself to that.

14:33.294 --> 14:37.138
That's what pisses me off about what Diane Ackerman said in The Times.

14:37.198 --> 14:42.723
It's almost like you're reading essays out of professional magazines.

14:42.743 --> 14:43.984
This is field work.

14:44.064 --> 14:45.666
Yeah, absolutely.

14:45.706 --> 14:52.772
The other thing that pissed me off was that I've had three letters from American

14:53.579 --> 15:04.395
American writers whose opinion I really, you know, whose good opinion I want to have, you know?

15:04.415 --> 15:04.535
Ralph.

15:04.836 --> 15:05.917
And Bob Stone, I think.

15:05.937 --> 15:06.638
Bob Stone.

15:06.839 --> 15:11.125
And actually, just before I left, I got a letter from Deliver.

15:11.826 --> 15:13.268
Those are three of my favorite writers.

15:13.288 --> 15:14.870
Well, exactly.

15:14.890 --> 15:15.131
Mine too.

15:15.411 --> 15:22.101
And what all of them said was they really loved the way the book was organized.

15:22.621 --> 15:25.306
These monks have never organized anything along with them.

15:25.526 --> 15:31.837
I assumed she was just a reviewer, a New York Times reviewer, and couldn't see it.

15:32.057 --> 15:34.742
In fact, she writes for the New Yorker.

15:34.762 --> 15:35.664
What does she write?

15:36.024 --> 15:44.219
She writes this, uh... The point is, I have always felt it.

15:44.239 --> 15:45.000
I get it out of the way.

15:45.588 --> 15:51.854
One of the reasons for doing this terrible trade, you know, there's no pleasure in writing, none, zero.

15:51.954 --> 15:53.596
I hate the business.

15:53.896 --> 15:57.540
And the satisfactions are true.

15:57.560 --> 16:03.606
One is getting it right, getting a sentence absolutely right in the paragraph, absolutely right.

16:03.626 --> 16:09.412
There's a kind of conflict of satisfaction in that, you know, a stonemason or something.

16:09.432 --> 16:12.135
And the other thing is if...

16:12.723 --> 16:15.727
I've always used to go out and look at things.

16:16.669 --> 16:23.098
You know, when I wrote about the North Sea, I went out and lived on a wine estimation.

16:23.579 --> 16:31.230
You know, the Vegas book gave me a chance to hang around professional poker.

16:31.250 --> 16:33.814
Was it the cot leading the horse or the horse leading the crank?

16:33.994 --> 16:34.935
Well, who knows?

16:35.596 --> 16:38.140
Did you want to go to Vegas and play poker or anything?

16:38.272 --> 16:41.575
How did you want to write a book about this?

16:41.676 --> 16:45.259
I wanted to use the fact I was interested in poetry.

16:45.279 --> 16:51.586
I mean, Sean, you see, William Sean, loved the idea of a poet going to Vegas.

16:51.646 --> 16:54.709
You know, that was a kind of gaffy idea.

16:55.210 --> 16:58.313
And it seems to me that this is what you should do.

16:58.333 --> 16:59.554
Is there poetry in Vegas?

17:00.215 --> 17:04.860
Well, I love about Vegas.

17:05.420 --> 17:08.143
What I really love about Vegas is this kind.

17:08.765 --> 17:13.230
It's the essence of that wonderful American cynicism.

17:13.951 --> 17:16.354
I mean, cynicism, of course.

17:16.374 --> 17:23.342
Which is, which is kind of, the Americans are kind of tougher and more realistic than the Europeans.

17:24.183 --> 17:27.567
In most ways, I'll give you an example.

17:27.707 --> 17:35.937
I went, I was in Vegas once, and I didn't want to go to a show, but I was with a couple of guys, one of them when we did a show.

17:36.457 --> 17:38.740
And I said, OK, George Burns is on.

17:38.760 --> 17:41.463
I'd been all these years, in fact, so I've never been to a show.

17:41.903 --> 17:43.986
Don't mind going here to see George Burns.

17:44.226 --> 17:47.290
So I called Caesar's Palace.

17:48.671 --> 17:49.612
How long did this?

17:49.632 --> 17:50.493
Ten years ago, yeah.

17:51.415 --> 17:56.641
And the guy said, I want to take off and see for the George Burns show.

17:57.342 --> 18:01.887
And this crably voice said, why do you want the Pelican show or the midnight show?

18:02.548 --> 18:04.590
And I said, I don't know, what do you recommend?

18:04.975 --> 18:14.531
He said, the guy's 88 years old, take the telephone.

18:14.551 --> 18:19.179
I mean, you know, automatic reaction.

18:19.500 --> 18:21.082
And I love that.

18:21.483 --> 18:23.046
It is a uniquely American city.

18:23.086 --> 18:24.388
That's right, yeah.

18:24.408 --> 18:25.931
I think it is.

18:25.951 --> 18:28.695
I mean, it's not Monte Carlo in Las Vegas.

18:28.735 --> 18:29.717
No, I agree.

18:30.136 --> 18:35.342
It's got none of that pretension that it hangs around gambling in Europe.

18:35.402 --> 18:39.527
I think it's mindfully garish and outrageous.

18:39.707 --> 18:40.728
Absolutely.

18:40.788 --> 18:44.993
I mean, Liberace was a quintessential.

18:45.013 --> 18:49.118
It's been mentioned in Vegas.

18:49.158 --> 18:52.602
They don't reach, or they'll just say Liberace.

18:54.744 --> 18:59.890
I've tried to place my literary column out there, and it's funny.

19:00.005 --> 19:01.086
serious, you know.

19:01.707 --> 19:20.151
On the other hand, I've got to tell you, it was the great irony, one of the great irony of my life, and that is that for a long time, in the 50s, 60s, I was, among other things, a poetry critic, and I was, and what again?

19:20.311 --> 19:21.392
A poetry critic.

19:21.473 --> 19:21.713
Okay, yes.

19:22.254 --> 19:29.623
And I discovered Sylvia Plath, I discovered for the English, Berman and Roll, and so on and so forth,

19:30.093 --> 19:33.438
I had all those Eastern European poems.

19:33.558 --> 19:35.401
I was editing the series, I brought them all.

19:35.762 --> 19:37.745
You know, they're all kind of complex now.

19:37.765 --> 19:38.846
But I did it.

19:38.987 --> 19:41.931
I'm sorry to say, I'm really not blowing my own trumpet.

19:42.272 --> 19:47.620
But I honestly changed the way people read poetry to me in The Speaking World.

19:47.840 --> 19:49.182
This was 30 years ago, yeah?

19:51.005 --> 19:57.435
The only place I'm really famous is Las Vegas, Nevada.

19:57.555 --> 19:58.817
Because of that book.

19:59.067 --> 20:03.654
because of the biggest game in time, which they won't love.

20:03.694 --> 20:05.417
Have you gotten away from the criticism?

20:05.958 --> 20:06.999
Oh, yeah, I do.

20:07.560 --> 20:08.902
Why is that?

20:09.243 --> 20:14.791
A little too static, perhaps?

20:15.152 --> 20:16.213
Yeah, exactly.

20:16.353 --> 20:26.509
I started off, like a lot of people do, as a young university teacher.

20:27.147 --> 20:31.514
And then I thought, I've never spent the whole of my life writing books about other people's books.

20:32.215 --> 20:37.603
And basically, I've always assumed that I was a writer and this is a cop-out, if I do that, yeah?

20:37.944 --> 20:43.873
So, I, um... I quit my job and do the same thing?

20:44.213 --> 20:44.594
Yeah, exactly.

20:44.614 --> 20:45.976
You've got to shoot the crap sucker.

20:45.996 --> 20:48.179
Yeah, you've got to shoot, you've got it, that's right.

20:48.220 --> 20:50.163
If you're a writer, you've got to fucking write.

20:50.583 --> 20:53.087
You know, that, um... And I did, I...

20:53.557 --> 20:59.826
And actually, that really was a gal, because I was offered a... I wasn't offered... I was an officer.

20:59.866 --> 21:03.992
I was hanging around, and I'd talk there for a year, you know, in a kind of unofficial way.

21:04.572 --> 21:22.838
And I was... And a job came up, and I was asked to apply, which is as near as they will get in that... I'd just got married for the first time to some totally inappropriate young lady.

21:23.476 --> 21:34.087
And I looked at her and I thought, how can I take her?

21:34.107 --> 21:40.974
I didn't work out, I didn't even bother, but I did not apply.

21:42.496 --> 21:47.861
And it's the only real decision I've ever came.

21:47.901 --> 21:48.682
I had no money.

21:48.722 --> 21:51.745
I had 30, what was voted 30 shillings, one pound.

21:52.180 --> 21:54.842
Now, Â£1.50 in the bank, nothing.

21:54.922 --> 21:58.125
I was flatbread, and I thought, fuck it, I'm going to do my own thing.

22:00.127 --> 22:01.588
What emerged from that decision?

22:01.609 --> 22:17.483
Well, what emerged from that decision was that I then spent an awful lot of time having to write reviews and get some pieces in order to... How old were you about it then?

22:17.503 --> 22:19.785
Twenty-seven.

22:19.805 --> 22:21.006
Twenty-seven, I guess, just two years.

22:22.032 --> 22:27.460
You said earlier you hate writing.

22:28.622 --> 22:31.866
You don't mean that.

22:32.307 --> 22:33.789
Well, I... It's a pain, yeah.

22:33.909 --> 22:34.931
It's a pain in the ass.

22:35.031 --> 22:35.732
Yeah, that's right.

22:35.752 --> 22:37.274
Yeah, well, that's right.

22:37.554 --> 22:39.657
I find it very difficult.

22:39.838 --> 22:42.842
I can't sit down and just... Are you easily distracted?

22:43.480 --> 22:44.421
Well, of course.

22:44.441 --> 22:45.342
I mean, I had a ton of work.

22:45.362 --> 22:47.485
I had four stories I had to have out by this morning.

22:47.505 --> 22:50.028
I finished the last one 15 minutes before we left.

22:50.589 --> 22:51.931
We have motives now.

22:52.051 --> 22:52.972
Yeah, yeah.

22:53.132 --> 22:54.093
We'll watch them.

22:54.113 --> 22:54.714
Yeah, yeah.

22:54.774 --> 22:57.197
You spend it all up in the head.

22:57.578 --> 22:59.961
But, man, I watched the football games on Sunday.

22:59.981 --> 23:00.301
You did?

23:00.601 --> 23:00.942
Bet.

23:01.443 --> 23:04.366
My wife says, well, you got all this work you do.

23:04.386 --> 23:05.227
You got all these stories.

23:05.247 --> 23:06.569
I said, oh, fuck it.

23:06.589 --> 23:07.971
It's a big game.

23:08.091 --> 23:11.395
I got money on this game.

23:12.151 --> 23:18.779
What was the spread?

23:18.799 --> 23:23.145
Oh, the spread, they were pretty close games, both of them, as a matter of fact.

23:23.205 --> 23:33.457
In fact, I had San Diego, and San Diego, and Pittsburgh was really favored to beat San Diego, so the spread there was about 10 points or so.

23:33.758 --> 23:34.699
But San Diego won.

23:35.405 --> 23:40.453
So they covered easily, and then I had San Francisco, and they killed Dallas.

23:40.634 --> 23:41.715
Yeah, they really did.

23:41.735 --> 23:42.897
What was the spread of?

23:43.258 --> 23:45.482
I didn't see this up yet.

23:45.502 --> 23:47.305
It was about six and a half points.

23:47.325 --> 23:48.166
It was close.

23:48.186 --> 23:51.432
In fact, a lot of people thought that Dallas was going to work.

23:51.512 --> 23:55.018
And they would have if they hadn't come from the first three possessions.

23:55.038 --> 23:57.882
I mean, a woman might crap out of it.

23:58.002 --> 24:01.969
But they basically thought they were a lousy game.

24:02.725 --> 24:04.987
Yeah, I saw the second one.

24:05.007 --> 24:07.290
I saw the 49ers.

24:07.670 --> 24:10.052
But I mean, anything to stay away from getting that piece done.

24:10.453 --> 24:15.818
I interview for, I do, publishes weekly now, which is kind of fun.

24:15.958 --> 24:18.481
And I had a big PW piece that was due yesterday morning.

24:18.701 --> 24:23.786
And I just, I did a spin-off of that for Hackensack, which is one of my papers.

24:23.847 --> 24:25.869
And then my regular column had to go out today.

24:26.229 --> 24:30.774
I got a piece I got to get to Minneapolis, which takes me tomorrow.

24:30.794 --> 24:32.175
And I got three interviews this week.

24:32.510 --> 24:41.980
So I have to say, I'm a little thin on... I didn't want to read the book pretty quickly, but when it comes down to, you know, writing it, I'm sure it'll be covered.

24:42.000 --> 24:46.365
You always manage to get a little bit of literary criticism into all of your books.

24:46.405 --> 24:57.216
I can't say I've read them all, but... Not all of them, but... Of course, and of course, the literature and sleep is endless.

24:57.377 --> 24:58.598
Absolutely endless.

24:58.618 --> 25:02.382
But you see, what I think is interesting...

25:03.948 --> 25:18.234
What I found out about this was that writers writing about dreams, mostly about nonsense, but it's the way in which dreams, what I'm trying to discuss and talk about there is the way dreams really infect the arts.

25:18.615 --> 25:27.812
The way you think when you're dreaming is the same as you think when you're really, you know, on song as a creative writer.

25:28.163 --> 25:30.970
I'm sure glad you got Shakespeare and Coleridge in there.

25:31.010 --> 25:31.552
Yeah, yeah.

25:31.572 --> 25:34.359
Shakespeare had to be one of the world's great insomniacs, I'm sure.

25:34.559 --> 25:35.301
I'm sure.

25:35.321 --> 25:36.664
Well, Shakespeare was happening.

25:36.704 --> 25:38.609
You probably said that it may be true.

25:38.629 --> 25:39.852
Yeah, you never know.

25:39.872 --> 25:41.717
That's the smartest sleep.

25:41.900 --> 25:42.962
the innocent sleep.

25:42.982 --> 25:44.564
I mean, he rhapsodized them.

25:44.584 --> 25:45.545
Yeah, that's right.

25:45.645 --> 25:47.788
And he lies the head that wears the crown.

25:47.808 --> 25:52.195
I mean, the worst thing Shakespeare could do to somebody is to prod them of sleep.

25:52.215 --> 25:52.776
That's right.

25:52.796 --> 25:54.358
Look what happens to Lady of the Mid.

25:54.398 --> 25:55.540
That's right.

25:56.080 --> 25:59.405
And Coleridge and Kublai Khan and all this other stuff.

25:59.425 --> 26:00.447
There's a lot about that.

26:01.288 --> 26:03.451
Which is a great story.

26:04.112 --> 26:04.212
Yeah.

26:04.900 --> 26:10.407
Did you learn anything that surprised, you know, you got into the REM stuff and the sleep laboratory?

26:10.427 --> 26:15.653
Oh, sleep lab was absolutely fascinating, because first of all, I go and watch this guy being hooked up and so on and so on.

26:15.673 --> 26:18.857
And that in itself is totally... Could you do that?

26:18.997 --> 26:20.979
Well, I then went and had myself hooked up.

26:21.600 --> 26:24.343
You know, in that same thing.

26:24.724 --> 26:31.532
And that really pissed me off, because what happened was, I'd watched this and so on, and I'd been with this,

26:31.883 --> 26:39.232
girl that used the head at the laboratory and walked her to get her out of life and what was happening and so on and so forth.

26:39.252 --> 26:41.596
It was kind of really fascinating.

26:41.616 --> 26:44.920
So I got a bunch laid up, get myself hooked up.

26:45.220 --> 26:50.847
You're like Medusa, you know, kind of great hair full, head full of snakes, you know, electronic snakes.

26:52.209 --> 26:54.272
So I thought, this is going to be very difficult.

26:56.815 --> 26:58.237
You know, my obsession takes it.

26:58.257 --> 27:00.500
I sleep like a baby.

27:00.540 --> 27:01.401
You're perfect for this.

27:01.803 --> 27:03.405
So I think, wonderful.

27:03.845 --> 27:09.171
Then, three weeks later, a month later, whatever it is, the computer readout comes through.

27:09.191 --> 27:14.637
I'd work in accordion to computer 23 o'clock in time.

27:15.117 --> 27:18.421
I thought I'd work in one day.

27:19.001 --> 27:28.992
Well, yeah, but it was just totally fascinating, because the actual, what the scientific machine

27:30.305 --> 27:35.150
that had happened was totally, and varies to my own subjective experience.

27:35.571 --> 27:35.951
Totally.

27:36.091 --> 27:44.441
You know, you've been out in the middle of the ocean, and you talk about true darkness.

27:44.581 --> 27:58.877
I remember when I was in the Navy crossing, being in the middle of the Pacific, and going out at night, because there's darkened ship, you have all these lights blazing, and the naval ship, and just being amazed at how

27:59.819 --> 28:01.941
But this is it.

28:01.961 --> 28:15.094
This is basically the thing I start from, and that is that we've lost darkness to the biggest step forward in kind of human progress.

28:16.375 --> 28:23.281
The first great one was the stuff we found, you know, in the hospital in years ago, or 350,000 years ago, where it was.

28:23.982 --> 28:29.067
And then the next one was about just over 100 years ago, when they

28:29.401 --> 28:33.125
I just did a piece on Thomas Edison.

28:33.986 --> 28:35.228
Exactly.

28:35.248 --> 28:37.991
You know about this stuff.

28:38.051 --> 28:42.456
Because that really changed a wonderful perception of the world.

28:44.399 --> 28:52.809
Being in the service, of course, especially out at sea, and in a ship with no windows, there is no day and night.

28:52.829 --> 28:53.690
No, that's right.

28:53.830 --> 28:58.075
If you stand watches, and if you're out there for five or six weeks at a time,

28:58.409 --> 29:02.415
You only know if it's daytime if you actually walk topside for any particular reason.

29:02.435 --> 29:03.056
But you didn't.

29:04.197 --> 29:04.958
You did or you didn't.

29:05.078 --> 29:05.539
I mean, I did.

29:05.559 --> 29:06.260
I used to go up.

29:06.340 --> 29:09.685
I love to watch the airplanes take off and land, so I did that.

29:10.226 --> 29:15.293
And I was always, you know, I remember computing wouldn't be in the absolute middle of the Pacific Ocean.

29:15.313 --> 29:20.060
I wanted to, you know, throw a dime out there or anything.

29:20.080 --> 29:21.101
Going down on the fly.

29:21.161 --> 29:23.244
So, I mean, I would think about that.

29:23.885 --> 29:27.370
But the guys that worked down in the boiler rooms, the night sweepers.

29:28.328 --> 29:30.370
No perception there.

29:30.390 --> 29:32.051
They called me snipes.

29:32.071 --> 29:32.772
Snipes, yes.

29:32.792 --> 29:37.957
I don't know if they used the same phrase on the British people, but they're the guys that work on the boilers.

29:37.977 --> 29:38.457
Yeah.

29:38.617 --> 29:40.419
I once wrote my passage on it.

29:40.439 --> 29:45.524
It was just when I was fresh out of school.

29:45.544 --> 29:47.466
But it was something real.

29:47.846 --> 29:51.149
But I worked in the boardroom when I first arrived.

29:51.369 --> 29:53.471
Somebody's whacking away at a saxophone out there.

29:53.491 --> 29:53.992
Can you hear it?

29:56.514 --> 29:56.614
Yeah.

29:57.657 --> 29:58.938
It's this crazy world.

29:59.019 --> 30:01.061
Yeah, I'll put this up in the table.

30:01.622 --> 30:02.483
What's your schedule, by the way?

30:02.543 --> 30:03.944
I don't have a week.

30:04.024 --> 30:05.106
You can't keep a lunch.

30:05.406 --> 30:11.453
Actually, I got my wife downstairs, so I'm going to meet up with her at about 1230.

30:11.573 --> 30:15.558
Okay, well, whatever.

30:15.598 --> 30:18.781
I appreciate it, but thank you very much.

30:19.222 --> 30:21.404
So what are you working on now, might we ask?

30:21.505 --> 30:22.726
A lot.

30:23.647 --> 30:24.508
I'm doing a

30:25.012 --> 30:26.894
longish piece of the New Yorker.

30:27.074 --> 30:38.087
I found the complication with this, what I want to do is I want to do a book on risk.

30:38.247 --> 30:41.010
I spent the whole of my life doing risk sports.

30:44.574 --> 30:54.765
The book that I felt I was put on this planet to write is

30:55.353 --> 31:00.779
Now what happened here?

31:01.019 --> 31:15.655
I'll tell you, the book I really, really wanted to write, I wanted to get on a space shot with, and I was agitated with Sean, too.

31:15.675 --> 31:16.176
No kidding.

31:16.576 --> 31:18.759
I was about to have done that.

31:18.779 --> 31:21.362
And I have gone on the next one after Challenger, too.

31:21.382 --> 31:24.465
Yeah, I was actually agitated to get on to Challenger.

31:24.749 --> 31:26.692
And he wouldn't have it.

31:26.732 --> 31:28.995
He said, it's too dangerous, you know.

31:29.996 --> 31:33.921
And, but I read, you know, I'm kind of a poet.

31:33.981 --> 31:38.287
I've got a really good eye for what happens, and I love machinery.

31:38.307 --> 31:39.849
Did you apply it after all?

31:39.869 --> 31:43.995
No, I just did it through him, because there's no way an Englishman at that point, 50-something years.

31:44.015 --> 31:51.305
Yeah, they sent the senator out, but I would have loved, and I'd love to have gone on one of those ships that went around the moon, and that's total darkness.

31:51.325 --> 31:51.685
Yeah, that.

31:52.171 --> 31:54.114
I'm just reading Lovell's book about that.

31:54.174 --> 31:55.075
Yeah, yeah.

31:55.095 --> 31:56.037
Go behind the moon.

31:56.157 --> 31:59.502
And that is, in fact, and then when they come around, and then it's total light.

31:59.843 --> 32:00.123
Yeah.

32:00.804 --> 32:01.225
You know?

32:01.826 --> 32:06.333
And there was a book published a couple of years ago about, you know, still one of the great I answer questions.

32:06.353 --> 32:13.103
How is it that light can go through, sunlight can go through the sky, and it's dark only until it hits like something?

32:13.123 --> 32:14.605
Why is it black in the sky?

32:15.126 --> 32:16.508
You know, why is the sky black?

32:17.213 --> 32:22.020
It's not illuminated, except that when it hits your spaceship or hits the Earth.

32:22.861 --> 32:26.526
I don't think that there's a satisfactory answer to it.

32:26.746 --> 32:30.511
There's a book on it, and when I think of it, I'll think about it.

32:30.772 --> 32:34.257
These guys are up here in their spaceship, total darkness.

32:34.757 --> 32:37.862
They come around the corner, and then the thing is totally illuminated in light.

32:38.042 --> 32:46.073
But what's interesting, of course, is that these suns from other galaxies don't, you know, that they're light.

32:46.272 --> 32:47.173
It doesn't.

32:47.193 --> 32:48.956
You think it would be measurable?

32:48.976 --> 32:52.742
I thought it would be like starlight or something.

32:53.002 --> 32:54.224
You'd think so, wouldn't you?

32:54.244 --> 32:55.806
Yeah, which is kind of light.

32:55.826 --> 32:56.227
Okay.

32:56.247 --> 33:06.182
Do you want to know what happened there?

33:06.643 --> 33:08.646
I'll tell you what happened there.

33:08.726 --> 33:08.926
1960.

33:08.946 --> 33:10.829
I used to be a very serious rock climber.

33:10.869 --> 33:11.831
I really loved it.

33:11.911 --> 33:12.111
Good.

33:12.665 --> 33:21.638
And 1960, the Russians sent a team of climbers to Great Britain.

33:21.998 --> 33:24.041
And I was climbing with them in North West.

33:24.602 --> 33:27.146
These poor buckles have never been outside the Soviet Union.

33:27.166 --> 33:28.668
They're never going to get out again.

33:29.789 --> 33:31.171
And they're really nice guys.

33:31.212 --> 33:34.216
And one of them fell off a terrible one on the face.

33:34.236 --> 33:34.817
He broke his leg.

33:35.377 --> 33:37.180
So the following day, I pretend.

33:37.200 --> 33:39.243
I fell off all the same.

33:39.784 --> 33:42.047
The following day, broke my leg.

33:42.584 --> 33:50.373
was taken to some worse hospital, which was like being in Zaire, you know, they hadn't invented anything, you know.

33:50.493 --> 33:56.100
And I broke my leg, and I also tore all the ligaments in the eye.

33:56.320 --> 33:57.681
But they didn't notice them.

33:57.862 --> 33:59.163
They didn't even look at the end.

33:59.924 --> 34:02.006
And they swept the leg wrong.

34:02.847 --> 34:03.308
You're right.

34:03.768 --> 34:04.149
Yeah.

34:04.830 --> 34:07.072
And now the whole thing is going off really good.

34:07.132 --> 34:10.296
So there's no, what's called cartilage between the

34:10.867 --> 34:14.331
Um, the leg bone and the anchor, that's just bone, right?

34:14.371 --> 34:18.175
They never would have let you go up on the shuttle, by the way.

34:18.195 --> 34:19.977
Well, it wasn't, it hadn't happened at that point.

34:20.158 --> 34:26.525
It was, it was, I was still, I was climbing, what would it be?

34:27.947 --> 34:39.540
Um, five, seven, in American standards, hard rock, until I was, well, less than two years before I was 63.

34:40.162 --> 34:45.868
So, you know, it wasn't... What do you think the kick would have been for you?

34:46.529 --> 34:49.552
Just a whole stage of going up there, the watch?

34:49.572 --> 34:51.394
Would you like to see the planet?

34:51.514 --> 34:52.735
Oh, I'd like to love it.

34:53.376 --> 34:57.280
Wouldn't she like a hundred thousand horses up your ass, you know?

34:57.400 --> 34:58.781
I flew at the Blue Angels once.

34:59.222 --> 34:59.842
Oh, did you?

35:00.523 --> 35:06.049
I've got a pal who flies over the place, and I fly with everybody on that sort of stuff.

35:06.069 --> 35:06.229
Oh, boy.

35:06.249 --> 35:08.311
I mean, he's stuck around its ass, too.

35:08.331 --> 35:09.412
Yeah.

35:09.432 --> 35:10.033
I mean, we were...

35:11.465 --> 35:14.128
20,000 feet or whatever.

35:14.248 --> 35:15.209
Nothing.

35:15.389 --> 35:16.310
And then we did that.

35:16.331 --> 35:18.953
And I have a pilot's license, so he let me do a little landing.

35:18.973 --> 35:19.434
Oh, really?

35:20.976 --> 35:32.269
And that was even, being on a carrier, I was a naval officer on an aircraft carrier, so I had my sure of cat shots, catapults, and landings, which are, you knowâ You were to fly.

35:32.329 --> 35:37.995
I was our pilot, but I was a public affairs guy, and I had connections, and Iâ

35:38.313 --> 35:48.342
was able to trade things like newspapers and movies and dirty pictures.

35:48.602 --> 35:49.904
I love that.

35:49.924 --> 35:50.744
Me too, yeah.

35:51.765 --> 35:53.167
Well, now I can't climb anywhere.

35:53.187 --> 35:59.953
I've got a pal who corrects old airplanes to handle it.

35:59.973 --> 36:04.277
And he does a quick plane.

36:04.977 --> 36:06.919
He flies down to some big

36:07.253 --> 36:12.458
who's a lovely guy.

36:12.658 --> 36:31.515
And we fly down, it's very, you know, a whole lot of us fly down in different, in various places, in sort of, you know, in formation practice.

36:31.535 --> 36:33.897
They're just boozing and take three days.

36:34.457 --> 36:37.260
But twice now, I've come back with this guy.

36:37.662 --> 36:47.753
in 60-year-old plays, 1930s, made out of, you know, wood and canvas and great single-edged.

36:47.773 --> 36:49.355
Yeah, but they're great airplanes.

36:49.375 --> 36:52.118
And we've done it in a day, a red search of England.

36:52.658 --> 36:54.280
I mean, those D.C.

36:54.300 --> 36:56.383
Drees are still a great thing.

36:56.663 --> 36:57.083
I know.

36:57.163 --> 36:58.084
They're 60 years old.

36:58.145 --> 36:58.325
Yeah.

36:58.425 --> 37:00.187
They're pale dragons, for God's sake.

37:00.207 --> 37:01.468
That's right, all these greats.

37:01.688 --> 37:01.989
Yeah.

37:02.009 --> 37:03.250
And they're great.

37:03.270 --> 37:03.550
Yeah.

37:03.751 --> 37:04.952
No, it's...

37:05.253 --> 37:06.635
Just fantastic.

37:06.695 --> 37:08.739
But unfortunately, I don't fly, he said.

37:08.839 --> 37:12.064
I have a phone.

37:13.606 --> 37:14.888
My wife is a kid.

37:15.109 --> 37:16.030
That's right, yeah.

37:16.050 --> 37:18.574
And I also maintain, I'm 51.

37:19.315 --> 37:21.379
Unless you aren't doing it off.

37:21.919 --> 37:23.802
You've got to do it a lot.

37:23.822 --> 37:24.884
You can't do it for me two or three hours.

37:24.904 --> 37:26.046
No, you've got to keep your license.

37:26.245 --> 37:27.126
Not just that.

37:27.146 --> 37:29.188
I mean, you should keep current, but you get rusty.

37:29.288 --> 37:30.449
It's like anything.

37:30.729 --> 37:32.071
Sure, yeah.

37:32.111 --> 37:33.592
If you lose your stroke, forget it.

37:33.792 --> 37:35.454
It is kind of paradoxical.

37:35.514 --> 37:45.564
I mean, you really get your adrenaline rush out of things, and yet your training is as a critic, a poet.

37:46.044 --> 37:50.789
It is kind of fun, actually.

37:50.849 --> 37:53.051
People have lots of science to them.

37:53.071 --> 37:54.733
The whole part of my life has been

37:55.186 --> 37:59.693
