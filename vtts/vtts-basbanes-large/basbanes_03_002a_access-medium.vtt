WEBVTT

00:03.322 --> 00:04.324
That's it.

00:04.524 --> 00:05.366
There we go.

00:06.348 --> 00:06.929
Very good.

00:06.989 --> 00:07.670
Nice and slow.

00:07.771 --> 00:08.793
Why not nice and slow.

00:08.813 --> 00:09.714
There you go.

00:09.734 --> 00:11.097
Okay, we were talking about Chester.

00:11.357 --> 00:22.298
Well, I was only talking about Chester and his enthusiasm for kind of other people's... Bon Moe and other people's kind of... Well, yeah, Bon Moe.

00:22.319 --> 00:22.579
He had a...

00:22.812 --> 00:30.120
framed statement that he hung up in New Haven, and he gave us a framed copy of it.

00:30.140 --> 00:31.141
Kate will know where it is.

00:31.382 --> 00:33.984
I think it used to be, so he was consigned to the basement for a time.

00:35.166 --> 00:43.775
But it was about the importance of books, and it had this phrase about, you know, books won't stay burned, that idea is a better idea, and so on.

00:44.156 --> 00:45.377
Which was, I mean, cool.

00:45.560 --> 00:57.190
completely unacceptable and one agreed with every word of it, but it was slightly, um, slightly self-important, slightly embarrassing, having just stuck up on that.

00:58.712 --> 01:03.036
Um, well, Tina Winer could tell you about Chester.

01:03.296 --> 01:07.880
And she has some really, really, very interesting stories about him.

01:07.900 --> 01:13.525
Especially from the female point of view, like, uh... Chester was not...

01:14.568 --> 01:22.219
He used to say, I remember, female staff in New Haven, as they had children, he'd say, they'd think they'd invented motherhood.

01:22.279 --> 01:23.761
Well, it's true.

01:23.781 --> 01:31.753
He was an amazing guy.

01:31.773 --> 01:35.217
Actually, I had a very considerable affection for him.

01:35.258 --> 01:37.541
He was a monster, too.

01:37.561 --> 01:40.585
He could behave very badly.

01:40.645 --> 01:43.309
I mean, like all of us, he was very...

01:43.559 --> 01:56.235
But really you're one of his triumphs.

01:56.502 --> 02:05.935
Well, I was very lucky and I was in the right place at the right time.

02:05.955 --> 02:14.527
And Chester was very supportive and so was the whole New Haven office, actually.

02:14.707 --> 02:18.072
So it wasn't...

02:19.030 --> 02:46.168
It was fun. It's quite a departure, though, I mean you have American university presses that have offices here but their sales offices are it's just something that you can put on the copyright page or the title page. You can't really regard them as legitimate divisions of. No no that's right. Acting as a publisher though, really. But what we were

02:46.587 --> 02:58.422
The reason Chester hired me was it was all to do with the Mellon Centre and it was sorting out problems back in New Haven.

02:58.442 --> 03:08.916
I don't know how much of this history you know, but the Mellon Centre had been set up by Paul Mellon in the 60s and it spent money like water.

03:09.115 --> 03:30.809
Yeah, and I can actually put some numbers on it, because they did a huge book on Hogarth, a two-volume book by Ron Paulson on Hogarth, and they spent Â£70,000 on printing, 3,000 copies of it, in 1969, which would be about a million pounds now, or a bit more.

03:30.909 --> 03:36.979
It's almost inconceivable that they could have found anyone to take so much money off them, but they did.

03:37.381 --> 03:42.528
It was set in hot metal, it was done in Holland, which then was not cheap.

03:43.389 --> 03:48.175
It was done very beautifully, but that's the resulting poet's cousin.

03:49.096 --> 03:53.122
It was not really a piece of fine bookmaking at all.

03:53.142 --> 03:59.831
They were spending this money at a prodigious rate, and Mellon's lawyers, I suppose, told him that he also reigned them in.

03:59.851 --> 04:02.494
And the way he did this was to

04:02.845 --> 04:07.871
fold it back into the museum that he was building in New Haven.

04:07.891 --> 04:19.684
And the university took on the obligations to run the Mellon Sector, which basically existed to collect photographs, to give some grants, and to act into a research centre in the UK.

04:20.225 --> 04:25.991
And it had this publishing commitment, serious publishing commitments, which were trivial, actually.

04:26.011 --> 04:31.317
I mean, it had published maybe ten books, eight books, and it had contracts to do four or five more.

04:32.056 --> 04:37.364
That obligation was passed by the university to the press in Iceland for about 69, 70.

04:37.384 --> 04:43.554
And the press, just being a good fit, said, OK, they'd pick that up and do the books.

04:44.475 --> 05:00.780
What the press didn't realise, or Chester didn't realise, was that these four or five books would involve him or someone at the press dealing with some fairly complicated, ambitious, difficult, opinionated Brits.

05:01.368 --> 05:26.987
and he hired a rather nice woman called Robin Bledsoe who he gave the job of producing these books out of New Haven and she was way at her death and couldn't cope with these senior arrogant greedy kind of needy people and so the first two or three books produced by the press out of New Haven were not significantly more

05:27.170 --> 05:36.604
successful in terms of economy and in terms of efficiency than the ones that have been done previously by the Foundation.

05:36.624 --> 05:38.107
And I think Robin then resigned.

05:38.648 --> 05:45.718
And Chester decided, rightly, that the only way to handle it, to sort this out, is actually to produce the books in the UK.

05:46.680 --> 05:54.031
And not only did Robin decide to resign, but Ellis Waterhouse, who was the old dinosaur running in the World Foundation.

05:54.151 --> 05:54.612
Yes, thanks.

05:54.912 --> 05:57.857
He also retired at Ellis Waterhouse.

05:57.897 --> 06:00.282
He was a grand old man of English art history.

06:00.302 --> 06:04.108
He used to be in the pleasure of Birmingham for a long time.

06:04.389 --> 06:07.334
He'd written a standard history of 18th century paintings.

06:07.695 --> 06:12.263
And he was replaced by

06:12.648 --> 06:28.962
And this was replaced by a very, not okay.

06:30.045 --> 06:33.492
Yeah, something.

06:37.994 --> 07:05.925
a little replaced by a very nice um brain who had been at the British Museum and went to Washington to the National Gallery, um had been keeping um drawings there, called Christopher White and he was he'd been unhappy in Washington and had come back to take this job, which was a job that was not and not a job that really stretched him. I mean a job that was

07:06.530 --> 07:08.412
It's a fairly easy job.

07:08.593 --> 07:12.718
But Christopher was desperate to go back to Britain.

07:12.738 --> 07:12.978
Thanks.

07:12.998 --> 07:17.144
And he, quite coincidentally, was a sort of remote friend of mine.

07:17.164 --> 07:18.946
I'd had feelings with him.

07:19.006 --> 07:22.210
Thanks, I'm sorry.

07:22.350 --> 07:28.598
And I suspect that Chester knew that or found that out.

07:29.079 --> 07:34.005
And so he decided to hire me.

07:34.340 --> 07:57.250
I think to solve a political problem that he got in New Hope, with these books giving trouble, and with the concern that I was almost still there, I don't know, it was my last look, that the Melbourne lawyers would get twitchy, and things had to be done that kept the Melbourne lawyers happy.

07:57.270 --> 08:03.638
And so he decided to give me the job of doing these books.

08:03.837 --> 08:08.822
And I knew Chester very slightly from... Now, you had been at Oxford, I think.

08:08.882 --> 08:10.563
I was at Oxford, I remember.

08:10.624 --> 08:12.585
The reason I knew Chester was because I remember.

08:12.605 --> 08:14.647
So I knew Robin.

08:14.687 --> 08:17.070
When he hired Robin, I had applied for that job.

08:17.090 --> 08:20.513
I was getting... I was becoming persona non grata at Oxford.

08:20.533 --> 08:21.554
I'd been there five years, six years.

08:21.614 --> 08:23.436
Now, why were you getting persona non grata?

08:23.456 --> 08:26.679
I'd fallen out with my boss and, you know, becoming up and see in difficult.

08:26.739 --> 08:32.244
And, you know, the way people do when they've been there five or six years and think they should be in charge and they're not, you know?

08:32.284 --> 08:33.085
And Oxford was...

08:33.689 --> 08:52.187
yeah whatever you say about whatever anybody says about yale oxford was a complete shambles of the 60s i mean it was a nightmare publishing place nightmare business it was quite i mean it's very interesting they published wonderful books um and i learned all kinds of things there was a business it was complete disaster and it was it took

08:52.488 --> 08:55.753
It made life difficult for its junior employees.

08:56.214 --> 08:57.796
It didn't nurture them or value them.

08:57.816 --> 08:59.919
It was run like a sort of Oxbridge College.

09:00.360 --> 09:04.426
Entirely in the interests of the fellows.

09:05.808 --> 09:07.391
And the sort of senior members.

09:08.693 --> 09:10.716
But that's why Chester knew me.

09:10.736 --> 09:14.221
At any rate, he invited me.

09:15.323 --> 09:16.284
So you were ready to move?

09:16.405 --> 09:17.366
I was ready to move, yeah.

09:18.087 --> 09:20.471
And my wife-to-be was then already working.

09:20.491 --> 09:21.212
I think I was married, I think.

09:21.361 --> 09:24.765
She was already working in London and she was a publisher as well.

09:24.786 --> 09:25.807
She was a publisher too.

09:25.827 --> 09:27.669
She lived in London, I lived in Oxford.

09:27.769 --> 09:32.556
So there was a lot of travel and I was ready to meet.

09:33.417 --> 09:46.454
But the thing that I guess made it all worthwhile was when Chester, I can remember when he interviewed me, he was saying, there are these three, four books that we're committed to and you can do some more.

09:46.474 --> 09:47.115
And I said, well, that's

09:48.597 --> 10:05.982
Yeah that is never going to make a publishing list and you can't make a publishing list in my view just out of books about British Art anyway. And so he said well so can I do other books as well, and he said yes and I said what I want to do and he said well any books that are

10:06.232 --> 10:32.712
appropriate for a university press and I'd been doing history books and a little bit of literature as well as literature but in effect I don't think he realised this I don't think I realised it really but he gave me carte blanche really to publish an academic list you know any academic list that I could reasonably sort of justify and so

10:33.468 --> 10:36.511
I think I was luckier than I realised.

10:36.591 --> 10:38.032
You were a kid too, right?

10:38.133 --> 10:40.375
Well, I was 28 or something.

10:40.655 --> 10:41.476
Well, they get younger.

10:41.496 --> 10:44.639
I mean, I went to Amazon the other day and the people there were like about 19.

10:44.679 --> 10:51.686
Yeah, I was quite young.

10:53.748 --> 10:59.373
But it was... There was a pre-existing business here, which was, I think, four people.

10:59.393 --> 11:01.355
I think I was a thick.

11:01.375 --> 11:01.956
And it was...

11:03.016 --> 11:08.105
just selling New Haven's books in Europe, as best it could.

11:08.626 --> 11:14.857
And there was a slight... and Yale has always had a strong... English-list has always been strongly-anglish-centric.

11:15.077 --> 11:22.510
There had been one book that Yale had published in Rather,

11:23.907 --> 11:27.952
dramatic circumstances, which was a sort of spy thriller.

11:27.972 --> 11:30.135
Do you know the story of the double-cross system?

11:30.175 --> 11:33.059
Have you been told about that?

11:33.119 --> 11:36.824
That wasn't mine, but it was one of Chester's greatest exploits.

11:36.864 --> 11:41.610
And Chester worked for the CIA, so he was... They say they all gailed.

11:41.691 --> 11:46.457
I'm sorry, Robert said he didn't really know that.

11:47.959 --> 11:51.163
The CIA is like a great pipeline.

11:52.831 --> 11:54.173
had came out of that world.

11:56.196 --> 12:04.630
I said, my God, he looks like John Foster Dulles, isn't he?

12:04.690 --> 12:07.695
Chester claimed to be left wing.

12:07.735 --> 12:09.198
Well, he was.

12:09.218 --> 12:12.082
He had left wing kind of aspirations.

12:13.585 --> 12:17.551
But he was a humane man in some ways.

12:17.752 --> 12:19.294
But Chester

12:20.995 --> 12:23.759
came out of this world, and he was, I think, finished with it.

12:23.799 --> 12:27.104
But in the 60s, it's going a long way, isn't it?

12:27.124 --> 12:43.907
In Britain, there was an obsessive sort of fascination with spies, of course, partly the Soviet spies, but actually what I'm talking about with German spies, Second World War spies, and the whole Enigma business, and what had been going on in Bletchley Park, and code-breaking and so on.

12:43.947 --> 12:45.229
Who doesn't love to read about that?

12:45.329 --> 12:45.549
Exactly.

12:46.230 --> 12:49.635
And there was this guy...

12:50.341 --> 13:02.796
called John Masterman, who by this point, by 68, 69, had become master of an Oxford college.

13:03.478 --> 13:04.300
But during the war,

13:05.090 --> 13:08.717
had been something in the Foreign Office.

13:08.797 --> 13:26.592
And it had been his job at the end of the war to write a report about what they called the double-cross system, which was a mechanism by which I think every German spy in Britain had become a double agent or was in any way under control of

13:27.247 --> 13:57.102
the British Secret Service and the Germans didn't know this and so all the information that they got fed back to them was wrong and he'd written a report about this in 546 and come 1966-67 he wanted to publish it really out of his pension I mean like politicians do now in those days they didn't and the Foreign Office wouldn't allow him to and said it was an official secret not permitted and Masterman being

13:57.655 --> 13:59.878
He was a funny bloke, actually.

13:59.898 --> 14:07.549
He was a sort of guy who was in the Foreign Office and then becomes head of an Oxford College.

14:07.569 --> 14:09.432
I mean, very, very self-confident.

14:09.452 --> 14:15.661
He pleases himself and basically continues himself to be above these kind of rules.

14:15.681 --> 14:24.253
And he decided that if he wasn't going to be allowed to publish it in the UK, he'd publish it in America.

14:24.672 --> 14:29.644
I don't know how he knew Chester, whether that was another wartime connection or whether that was through somebody else.

14:30.506 --> 14:37.382
But anyway, he sent it, sent the manuscript to Yale, and Yale published it.

14:37.700 --> 15:07.639
They then imported back into the UK, and it was a huge success and it sold 50 60 buying copies. Can I interrupt this for a second? Is it known that Chester was CIA? Certainly known that it's, yeah I think so yeah no I think I'm sure that's right. Yeah you know I mean I wrote in my last book nobody seemed to have known that but I don't know what happened the Houghton Library oh right

15:08.125 --> 15:21.200
The guy, I think he's just died, Robin Wicks, is he dead?

15:22.982 --> 15:26.887
He knew all about Chester's background.

15:26.927 --> 15:27.568
Did he write about it?

15:28.028 --> 15:35.517
Well yes, he wrote a book called Yale, he wrote a book about Yale and Spike, didn't he?

15:35.952 --> 15:38.335
I don't even have to ask anybody if it's in there.

15:38.415 --> 15:42.401
I think it's important.

15:42.421 --> 15:42.741
No, I'm not.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.024
Because he did a lot of neo-climb books.

15:45.585 --> 15:46.046
Chester did.

15:46.066 --> 15:46.567
Chester did?

15:46.587 --> 15:48.009
Yeah, Chester did.

15:48.029 --> 15:50.732
This kind of thing is going to be unthinkable today.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.214
When did he do that?

15:52.234 --> 15:54.257
According to Johann Heiden.

15:54.297 --> 15:56.240
Very little New York thing.

15:56.340 --> 15:58.964
I don't know about that.

15:59.024 --> 16:02.829
I've got the transcript of my writing for that interview with me today.

16:02.849 --> 16:05.132
I'll go and get it exactly since it's right here today.

16:06.260 --> 16:12.166
Well, at least... This is going to be a fun little book.

16:12.186 --> 16:14.208
You know what I like about it?

16:14.228 --> 16:15.369
Is that it has such little expectations.

16:15.409 --> 16:17.992
Maybe they expect it to be a special thing or something like this, you know?

16:18.032 --> 16:18.252
Yeah.

16:18.372 --> 16:23.998
I think I'm going to come in and write something that's going to be... It's going to be an interesting book with stories.

16:24.018 --> 16:25.219
Well, that's fun.

16:25.319 --> 16:28.062
And otherwise, why bother?

16:28.082 --> 16:31.826
You know, I mean, I'm... Why bother?

16:31.926 --> 16:32.026
Yeah.

16:32.106 --> 16:33.347
Go on.

16:33.614 --> 16:46.533
I think if you can make it a funny story, that will be... There must be people at Yale who... Well, you know what the... The challenge is for me, is that my editor in Harper is having a few Van Dusen, good old guy.

16:46.553 --> 16:50.819
Van Dusen, he's... Yeah, he's a kind of drunk.

16:50.919 --> 16:51.741
Yeah, exactly.

16:51.761 --> 16:54.725
Yeah, but this is not how we connected.

16:54.745 --> 16:57.128
I mean, this is his editor.

16:57.409 --> 16:58.090
It's my last book.

16:58.110 --> 16:58.591
Yeah.

16:59.312 --> 17:02.997
And I thought that he'd be... I think he was so excited.

17:04.411 --> 17:07.355
Anyway, Masterman did this book.

17:07.395 --> 17:19.231
Chester published it, made a big success of it.

17:19.251 --> 17:25.659
He became something of a celebrity in London circles, because he'd been two fingers to the government.

17:25.679 --> 17:32.308
He became very friendly with Joe Crook, who was then the editor of the CLS, who was an admirer and friend of Chester's.

17:32.491 --> 17:39.163
He sort of fancised himself as a British publisher.

17:39.703 --> 17:44.251
You think that was what encouraged him to embark on this?

17:44.311 --> 17:49.821
Yeah, I don't think... There were two things encouraging him.

17:49.881 --> 17:57.975
One was the success of The Mastermind, and the other was that he was desperately keen to have an excuse to come to London every six months, three months to go to the theatre.

17:58.411 --> 17:59.492
Yeah, he did.

17:59.572 --> 18:02.195
I mean, he enjoyed it.

18:02.355 --> 18:08.320
He was a man who enjoyed British culture, society, and particularly Scottish culture and society.

18:08.360 --> 18:13.365
He got involved in restoring some old castle up in Jedburgh.

18:13.625 --> 18:19.411
Which, funny enough, the Yale Press, the existing, right now, Yale Press, had just published last month a book.

18:19.731 --> 18:22.374
We published a series of architectural guides for him.

18:22.394 --> 18:23.715
Just published a volume on the Borders.

18:24.195 --> 18:25.937
It has a whole bit about...

18:26.423 --> 18:32.836
Chester's castle outside of Jedra and how it was restored 20 years ago.

18:32.856 --> 18:33.938
Is Chester in the book?

18:33.978 --> 18:36.624
No, not the family.

18:37.405 --> 18:42.255
But Chester, you know, panting in Scotland is Scotland.

18:42.505 --> 18:44.889
He enjoyed very much the theater.

18:44.909 --> 18:46.351
He liked staying in nicer hotels.

18:47.112 --> 18:50.778
I think he found you having a bit, you know, provincial.

18:50.798 --> 19:03.557
He actually had perception to see that he was initiating something that would become almost unique about the numerical university presses.

19:03.577 --> 19:03.998
I have no idea.

19:04.018 --> 19:05.560
He might have done that.

19:05.776 --> 19:14.754
Robert said this morning, I asked him, I said, do you think that the University Press London division is a British publisher?

19:14.894 --> 19:18.180
He said, I think it is.

19:18.401 --> 19:20.906
Would you agree with that?

19:21.006 --> 19:21.647
I'm sorry.

19:22.388 --> 19:23.631
I'm glad I don't know.

19:23.932 --> 19:24.713
That's fascinating.

19:24.693 --> 19:26.355
I think the answer is no.

19:26.435 --> 19:32.804
I think he did have a perception because I think although it suited him as basic as what he just suggested, like coming here and there.

19:32.824 --> 19:45.622
I think it suited him personally, but it didn't particularly suit him politically or professionally because I think one of the reasons why I enjoyed myself so much for those 20 years working for Yale was basically because Navy New Havens had any serious interest in what we were doing.

19:45.662 --> 19:46.864
So you had a ton of things.

19:46.884 --> 19:49.047
So we had freedom, yeah.

19:49.280 --> 19:54.811
It was only when they began to take the interest that it got kind of more oppressive and kind of less fun.

19:54.831 --> 19:59.139
John Wright's words were, for a period, you were at their cash cow.

19:59.260 --> 19:59.861
Yeah, we were.

19:59.881 --> 20:00.903
But they would never admit that.

20:00.983 --> 20:02.746
I mean, he said it after.

20:02.767 --> 20:03.348
No, he would not.

20:03.408 --> 20:04.590
He only admitted it after.

20:04.610 --> 20:06.253
They never said so at the time.

20:06.313 --> 20:07.075
I mean, I knew.

20:07.095 --> 20:07.636
He said it.

20:07.937 --> 20:08.638
I knew.

20:08.618 --> 20:12.163
But nobody else did.

20:12.183 --> 20:12.985
Nobody did in the book.

20:13.005 --> 20:14.206
Yeah, yeah, well, fine.

20:14.226 --> 20:15.408
But probably it should be.

20:15.488 --> 20:21.016
But no one else in New Haven would at that point have admitted it or have even recognized it.

20:21.037 --> 20:24.382
I mean, it was, oh, because they didn't think in those terms.

20:24.442 --> 20:26.344
And nobody said it in public, ever.

20:26.945 --> 20:31.813
I mean, I'm amused that John should say it now, because obviously it was true.

20:32.393 --> 20:33.936
And he said it to me at the time.

20:33.956 --> 20:37.461
But it suited, I think it suited John in the same way it suited Chester.

20:38.032 --> 20:42.798
not, excuse me, not overplay it.

20:42.818 --> 20:47.464
Because I wouldn't find my ambitions to interfere with what happened in New Haven.

20:47.544 --> 20:49.747
I just didn't want them to interfere too much.

20:49.987 --> 20:51.429
So what were your ambitions?

20:51.489 --> 20:52.931
Did you have ambitions or was it?

20:52.951 --> 20:55.794
You didn't have any ambitions.

20:55.814 --> 20:56.916
That's a terrible question.

20:56.936 --> 21:01.381
I mean, our ambition is to publish as many details.

21:01.501 --> 21:02.923
Do you have a vision?

21:03.384 --> 21:03.664
No.

21:03.824 --> 21:06.908
Certainly not a vision.

21:07.310 --> 21:12.357
No, I mean, was it Morris Philipson at Princeton?

21:13.098 --> 21:14.120
Yeah, he was at Chicago, wasn't he?

21:14.140 --> 21:15.081
He was a guy.

21:15.101 --> 21:25.597
The old codger at Princeton, I can't remember his name, who once said, the mission of the University Press, the job of the University Press is to publish as many decent books as it can without going bankrupt.

21:25.617 --> 21:30.624
And I thought, I mean, that is roughly what I thought we should be trying to do.

21:31.586 --> 21:31.866
And...

21:32.453 --> 21:40.869
There were all kinds of fundamental... A extraordinary thing happened on the way to publishing these books.

21:40.910 --> 21:41.891
We made quite a lot of money.

21:42.012 --> 21:44.697
And the money was then dissipated by others.

21:45.999 --> 21:47.262
Many of them in New Haven.

21:47.543 --> 21:50.047
On the other side of the... Some of them here.

21:50.128 --> 21:51.390
We dissipated our share of it.

21:51.370 --> 21:55.636
Did you bring an firm business sense to the task?

21:55.756 --> 22:05.128
I think that's not the way university presses are normally operated.

22:05.148 --> 22:11.016
I don't know about in the UK, but in the United States, I think Yale is the only one that operates in the black.

22:11.076 --> 22:12.658
If there's another one, I'd like to know what it is.

22:12.678 --> 22:15.201
I think it is good.

22:15.181 --> 22:16.704
Harvard Sunday?

22:16.804 --> 22:19.388
No, I suppose I did.

22:19.528 --> 22:23.335
I mean, I don't know quite where I got it from.

22:23.375 --> 22:36.717
My father was a businessman, and my wife was a businesswoman, so I guess I sort of... But, I mean, of course, there is a fundamental issue there, which is not what we should be talking about, but one of the problems with the university press is that this...

22:37.068 --> 23:04.560
cross-subsidy from the profitable books and the unprofitable books is usually done in a very secretive and undiscussed and usually probably rather inappropriate sort of way Thank you very much I'm not sure quite what the right way to do it would be but usually it's pretty sort of murky just how you decide which books you take on

23:04.844 --> 23:10.598
that aren't going to make money, which ones should ask, that there's very... So that has to be a higher purpose then?

23:10.618 --> 23:15.952
Well, it should be, it should be, but it's not, and there's no adequate mechanism to do it.

23:15.972 --> 23:22.127
As if Ebi Yosier, an editor-in-law meeting, and you say, well, this book is really good, but it's going to lose Â£10,000.

23:22.107 --> 23:25.532
Everybody else in our television says, well, we don't want these Â£10,000.

23:25.812 --> 23:30.840
And he says it's really good, but he says his book's really good and it's going to make Â£10,000.

23:30.860 --> 23:35.307
So, you know, there is never any real honesty or transparency about this.

23:35.687 --> 23:38.151
And I'm not sure there can be.

23:38.171 --> 23:42.858
But we had lots of luck.

23:43.198 --> 23:49.127
We had the Mellon books that were no kind of drain on Yale's parlance.

23:49.428 --> 23:55.176
And we managed to make some of them successful, surprisingly.

23:55.797 --> 24:02.126
And then we were in the right place because Illustrated Publishing, which is what I just happened to be interested in.

24:02.146 --> 24:04.309
I should say that was almost inspired.

24:04.529 --> 24:05.310
It has, yeah.

24:05.811 --> 24:14.102
But in the late 70s, early 80s, it was booming and growing.

24:14.943 --> 24:20.190
And it was easy to do, and it was much easier to do in England than it was in America.

24:20.210 --> 24:30.365
And so, you know, it was just a matter of being in the right place at the right time, and having the right interests, and being able to take advantage of them and exploit them.

24:30.385 --> 24:39.498
Well, I can say I was a book review editor in Massachusetts from 1978 to 1991 when I left to write my books.

24:39.698 --> 24:41.701
And then I continued to write.

24:41.721 --> 24:42.402
I still write.

24:42.652 --> 24:46.056
book reviews and get reviews done.

24:46.377 --> 25:08.406
And I would say, without any clarification, one of the reasons I decided to take this Yale offer was because of the extraordinary regard and respect and admiration I have had over the last 30 years for the art books that I have said, in front of me, that

25:08.386 --> 25:15.931
The finest art books published in the world, as far as I'm concerned, without any qualification are the Yale books.

25:16.152 --> 25:19.122
I mean, I forget about them.

25:19.270 --> 25:22.575
We used to do some nice books.

25:24.357 --> 25:32.269
Not only for the exquisite nature of their design and their production, but the level and the depth of the scholarship is fantastic.

25:32.289 --> 25:33.531
And it continues.

25:33.591 --> 25:35.975
And it's not just one or two a year.

25:35.995 --> 25:38.578
It's 10, 12, 15 a year.

25:38.598 --> 25:40.181
And it's just unremitting.

25:40.241 --> 25:41.643
They come one after the other.

25:42.264 --> 25:42.865
I keep them.

25:42.965 --> 25:45.629
I never sent them out for review.

25:45.669 --> 25:47.792
I kept them for myself and did them myself.

25:48.076 --> 25:49.044
I don't quite know what to say.

25:49.064 --> 25:52.652
I mean, obviously I appreciate very much what you're saying.

25:53.088 --> 25:54.209
entirely think you're wrong.

25:54.309 --> 26:01.196
Well, that's very nice of you, and I'm flattered.

26:01.837 --> 26:03.719
What inspires you?

26:03.799 --> 26:05.841
I mean, what elevates them?

26:05.861 --> 26:15.291
So why is it that so many others are unable to do what you did and what Yale, I think, continues to do quite remarkably?

26:15.311 --> 26:21.137
I hope we're not going off track, but I really do want to talk about The Night Book.

26:21.370 --> 26:47.462
University press to be doing that. I don't know I mean other university questions do an occasional. I mean we were we were very lucky. I mean it not really was a major part of it and I'm very touched by what you say there and it's quite I mean apart from John occasionally John occasionally one-to-one saying nice things about this no one said it in print over the years. Well reviewers do say I'm afraid

26:47.645 --> 26:54.134
I've got extremely thick skin not to say what reviewers say very seriously.

26:54.174 --> 27:00.602
I can't take what reviewers say very seriously in case they say nasty things because I have to ignore that too.

27:00.883 --> 27:03.667
But it is very gratifying the way in which the books have been received.

27:03.687 --> 27:06.210
And I think it's probably fair to say that I'm

27:06.393 --> 27:15.358
I was intermittently hurt or slightly puzzled that no one except John and Rollins occasionally seemed to know.

27:15.498 --> 27:21.735
I mean the president of the university had no idea what we were doing for instance when I was introduced to him not so very long ago.

27:21.715 --> 27:25.739
They had no understanding of what we were doing at all.

27:25.959 --> 27:32.245
I wouldn't expect them to have much, but I would have thought they might have just... That's a surprise.

27:32.405 --> 27:41.494
Well, I mean, I was not... I was not bothered by that, because it just meant they weren't looking, which was fine.

27:41.514 --> 27:45.497
Sometimes it's a bit of a thing, aren't they?

27:45.517 --> 27:46.618
Absolutely.

27:47.940 --> 27:49.461
That's exactly what I thought.

27:49.795 --> 28:07.180
um but i but the only reason you were able to do it was because britain was the right country to be in no other competition was was feeble i mean no other

28:07.379 --> 28:10.622
University Press was interested in illustrated books.

28:11.223 --> 28:14.947
Isn't it interesting that a university press can pick this up?

28:14.967 --> 28:17.089
Why didn't a trade publisher pick it up?

28:17.209 --> 28:21.173
Well, some trade publishers did, but they weren't interested in serious artists.

28:21.393 --> 28:36.829
What you might call illustrated books were reinvented in Britain in the 1970s and 80s by people like Dolan Kindersley and Walker Books and Mitchell Beasley and at some level my wife, who were

28:37.180 --> 28:48.597
taking advantage of new technologies to produce illustrated books and sell them to big American publishers like Simon Schuster and Reader's Digest, and very large numbers.

28:48.617 --> 28:52.523
At one level, I was just sort of coattailing on that.

28:52.603 --> 28:53.785
We were just coattailing on that.

28:54.486 --> 29:03.559
In a culture where academic presses thought that books for pictures were basically children, grown-ups didn't need pictures, and where

29:04.079 --> 29:06.444
Trade publishers.

29:06.505 --> 29:20.637
Funny, I learned more about this as I grow older, but my new kind of retired trade publishers who were active in the 70s and 80s, they all thought had been led to believe by their production departments or whoever that picture books were just endless trouble and you couldn't get them right.

29:20.937 --> 29:32.480
and that it was much more fun to publish novels or publish high profile political memoirs or whatever, or even history books, which it perhaps was.

29:32.500 --> 29:38.592
And the satisfaction that comes from art books is not really the reviews or the sales necessarily, it's actually

29:38.572 --> 29:41.658
the sense of producing a beautiful, satisfactory book.

29:41.678 --> 29:42.920
It's a sort of physical thing.

29:42.940 --> 29:44.263
Some of that book that pleases you.

29:44.363 --> 29:47.269
Yeah, quite a book that pleases everybody who has to do with it.

29:47.950 --> 29:51.196
But, you know, the history book looks alright or not, it doesn't matter too much.

29:51.938 --> 29:57.669
With an art book, you've got to feel that the author is satisfied with it, or the institution that might have sponsored it.

29:58.170 --> 30:01.356
And one has to be satisfied with it oneself.

30:01.505 --> 30:07.232
Because we were so good, it was just me, I got very involved in the design and production of books.

30:07.252 --> 30:11.737
I was just anticipating my next question, because that's exactly what John said.

30:11.817 --> 30:14.440
He didn't use the phrase, I'll find it.

30:14.460 --> 30:15.721
You can just keep going.

30:15.741 --> 30:20.106
Well, I remember the first book about design.

30:21.088 --> 30:21.949
I was rather proud of it.

30:21.969 --> 30:22.790
I showed it to my father.

30:24.371 --> 30:27.495
And he said, John, I think it was a real pest.

30:27.728 --> 30:32.533
We kind of cleaned it up, but it was all over the place.

30:32.573 --> 30:33.474
Here's a giant book.

30:33.494 --> 30:35.256
He says, you did a very unusual thing.

30:36.878 --> 30:44.926
He said you wanted to be able to control the quality of the production, the product, the production quality of the book.

30:44.946 --> 30:46.828
He used the phrase engine work.

30:46.928 --> 30:49.090
That was one of his phrases, yeah.

30:49.130 --> 30:49.751
Workshop.

30:50.392 --> 30:51.453
Make it look right.

30:51.513 --> 30:54.296
Then he also mentioned it.

30:54.956 --> 30:56.638
I used to

30:56.888 --> 31:18.188
love... Is that kind of an interesting phrase? He's actually right. I mean have you ever been to a print work. I mean do you know about them, but have you been there all night? Well I mean those printing presses are um well somebody said I'm not sure this is true that you know that the only thing really compared to is steam engines that they have this huge kind of discoral kind of um power

31:18.691 --> 31:24.081
and authority, a rather comforting kind of noise that they make, not unlike steam engines with lots of air, hissing and so on.

31:24.141 --> 31:33.679
It's not a frightening kind of machine, but you have this impression of things being made there and down, and you can tweak them, you can adjust them.

31:34.321 --> 31:39.110
And when you're printing an artwork, a 24-hour shift, you have to be around all the time.

31:39.731 --> 31:40.412
And in those days,

31:40.966 --> 31:41.947
it made a difference.

31:41.987 --> 31:50.219
Nowadays, the technology is so sophisticated that actually it's pretty much a waste of time to be there because it's all going to be whatever you've given them is what you're going to get.

31:50.239 --> 31:53.423
But in those days, it was still a craft to a considerable degree.

31:53.724 --> 31:59.752
So I actually remember the first time it had been said to me, well, the computer... So you actually went down there for the rents?

31:59.772 --> 32:00.713
I spent lots of time.

32:00.733 --> 32:03.077
And so where were the books actually produced?

32:03.097 --> 32:04.258
Well, over the place.

32:04.318 --> 32:08.124
So you would go to all these plants and supervise these actual production?

32:08.144 --> 32:08.725
Oh, yeah.

32:08.805 --> 32:10.467
And I spent a lot of time in...

32:10.750 --> 32:14.235
Initially we printed them in the UK in the 70s.

32:14.435 --> 32:20.263
And they're all now bankrupt except for one printer's roundabout in England and Scotland.

32:20.924 --> 32:22.707
And then we started printing in Italy.

32:23.147 --> 32:25.090
And I spent a lot of my life in Milan.

32:25.110 --> 32:28.715
Well, in the rather seedier suburbs of Milan.

32:28.735 --> 32:35.144
And in the middle of the night in fog and snow.

32:36.506 --> 32:37.748
And then in Hong Kong.

32:38.409 --> 32:39.390
And then in Singapore.

32:40.282 --> 32:47.569
So yes, I used to spend three or four weeks a year as the office and printers.

32:47.649 --> 32:48.670
What were you looking for?

32:48.690 --> 32:52.394
Well, when you're printing, you're looking for two things.

32:52.414 --> 33:03.384
You're looking for mistakes that you can fix at the last minute, but basically... Registration, colour... Basically, mistakes are, you know, things are actually wrong, otherwise it's a massive degree.

33:03.985 --> 33:07.588
And with colour printing, even with black and white printing in those days,

33:07.940 --> 33:08.881
by being there.

33:08.901 --> 33:10.163
You could say, no, I don't like that.

33:10.243 --> 33:10.964
It's got to be better.

33:11.065 --> 33:16.132
They throw away the... Oh, yeah, yeah.

33:16.232 --> 33:17.514
It's very good, thanks.

33:17.674 --> 33:21.299
Oh, sure they would.

33:21.319 --> 33:25.606
They would take the job off the press and redo it.

33:26.006 --> 33:32.215
And printers are... It has changed, but standards were terribly, terribly low.

33:32.836 --> 33:34.338
In Britain, they were appallingly low.

33:34.899 --> 33:36.141
Even in Italy, they weren't.

33:36.678 --> 33:39.984
not that high, and they were higher in the Far East.

33:40.004 --> 33:54.248
But another pair of eyes, a critical pair of eyes, a customer's eyes, sees things that the operative on the press, who basically just wants to get home and wants to produce an acceptable job, doesn't necessarily see.

33:54.268 --> 33:56.712
And colour printing is quite a

33:57.012 --> 33:59.015
an artful game.

33:59.276 --> 34:08.090
There are the problems of tracking, this picture running with that picture, this picture's got a woman in a red dress, this picture's got a picture of snow or something.

34:08.170 --> 34:13.679
It's no surprise that snow gets a bit pink because there's so much red ink to paint the red dress, to print the red dress.

34:15.402 --> 34:16.443
That's an unavoidable issue.

34:16.844 --> 34:18.126
But someone has to strike a compromise.

34:18.376 --> 34:24.583
And you either let the printer take the picture, so it's usually, well, I've got these two proofs, nice red dress, nice white snow.

34:24.623 --> 34:25.644
The snow gets a bit pink.

34:26.786 --> 34:29.709
Let back keep the red dress, because the prints are like... So what drove you to do this?

34:29.769 --> 34:31.571
Did you have some disasters in the random?

34:31.591 --> 34:34.675
I mean... Oh, yeah.

34:34.955 --> 34:36.757
That's unacceptable.

34:36.777 --> 34:37.438
It's outrageous.

34:38.059 --> 34:40.421
Why did I... You say, why did I?

34:40.461 --> 34:44.166
Because I knew already that that was the only way to get it done properly.

34:44.186 --> 34:47.910
And it started... It started in the UK.

34:48.565 --> 34:51.488
So you saw the books that were being produced and obviously they were hopeless.

34:51.648 --> 34:52.849
They were inadequate.

34:52.870 --> 34:56.233
They were unsatisfactory.

34:56.253 --> 35:01.779
And I knew that the anywhere I was going to get them right was to go there and sit on the press to make sure they did it.

35:01.799 --> 35:02.920
So how much time would you spend there?

35:02.940 --> 35:04.782
Would you actually stay for the whole line?

35:04.802 --> 35:05.102
Yeah.

35:06.203 --> 35:06.504
Yes.

35:06.524 --> 35:08.326
Oh, for the big books, the important books.

35:09.187 --> 35:10.848
The Max Gerard book, for instance?

35:10.948 --> 35:11.509
Yeah, yeah.

35:11.549 --> 35:12.430
That was...

35:12.967 --> 35:14.950
That was actually physically a relatively easy book.

35:15.210 --> 35:16.272
Oh, it had a real desire to do.

35:16.292 --> 35:23.062
But that's one of your great, really... Yeah, it was very, very successful, but it wasn't... But it's not one of those, the artful tool plates and the colour separation.

35:23.123 --> 35:25.987
I saw all of that book being printed.

35:26.007 --> 35:33.238
So if I look at it now, I think, God, won't those standards be accepted in those days?

35:34.800 --> 35:37.304
But by going there, I'm going to a printer.

35:38.366 --> 35:40.109
It's a bit like watching the builders.

35:40.129 --> 35:41.050
I mean, you don't really know...

35:41.435 --> 35:45.960
how to lay the bricks, or the nuances of good and bad bricklaying.

35:45.980 --> 35:54.530
If the customer's there, watching and caring and taking an interest, the bricklayer, the printer, realizes he's got to raise his game a bit.

35:54.931 --> 35:55.952
That there's someone there who cares.

35:56.052 --> 35:59.836
And of course they, most of them, care too.

36:00.177 --> 36:04.862
And so if there is someone who's interested, and who asks questions, and says, why isn't this as good as that?

36:04.882 --> 36:06.184
And can we make this better?

36:06.204 --> 36:06.784
What can we do?

36:06.844 --> 36:10.108
I mean, then you see it in an adversarial kind of way.

36:10.477 --> 36:12.804
They'll say, well, yeah, we probably could if we did this.

36:12.904 --> 36:14.188
And they'd get, yeah, okay.

36:14.228 --> 36:18.199
It's a seduction as well as a carrot as well as a stick.

36:18.219 --> 36:23.895
So I used to spend a lot of time, and my colleagues, when we grew...

36:25.175 --> 36:33.872
My colleagues who sort of took over the design and production of the editing books, who I recruited, they all spent a lot of time with printers too.

36:33.892 --> 36:43.470
And it's only stopped, I suppose, in the mid-90s, by which point, and gradually became clear in the early 90s, we felt that each visit to a printer achieved less.

36:44.041 --> 36:45.282
Because really they could do it.

36:45.302 --> 36:46.844
They got it right most of the time.

36:47.324 --> 36:49.286
Initially they got it wrong.

36:49.306 --> 36:53.110
But standards were transformed between 75 and 95.

36:54.171 --> 36:55.512
Plus the equipment got better.

36:56.873 --> 36:58.194
The technology got better.

36:58.275 --> 37:01.177
That's right.

37:01.197 --> 37:04.280
And now... It probably wasn't digital when you started.

37:04.420 --> 37:06.783
Certainly wasn't that.

37:06.803 --> 37:07.684
And the machines were old.

37:08.424 --> 37:09.725
And standards generally were low.

37:09.765 --> 37:12.428
Nobody expected proofs to be matched on first.

37:12.745 --> 37:16.208
The question was, what compromises did you make?

37:16.228 --> 37:22.994
And I'd rather make those compromises myself than entrust them to some half-educated Italian.

37:23.014 --> 37:26.357
I mean, not to be... Probably couldn't read English, right?

37:26.377 --> 37:27.378
Well, it certainly couldn't read English.

37:27.999 --> 37:35.466
And the irony, of course, with Italians is that they all think they know what Fiore della Francesca should look like.

37:35.606 --> 37:40.631
But they didn't claim to know what impressionists look.

37:40.651 --> 37:42.212
So beyond production, which is...

37:43.492 --> 37:55.449
exacting them, such as I've never come in contact with the content, developing the list.

37:56.030 --> 38:00.837
I have a question of advice, really, of knowing who to ask.

38:00.857 --> 38:10.511
I think academic publishing is quite easy, if you know where to go for advice.

38:10.531 --> 38:12.975
And it's not from trade publishing.

38:13.175 --> 38:15.958
You don't have to have a feel for it.

38:16.619 --> 38:22.545
You've got to have a sense of whether people are going to be interested in something.

38:22.565 --> 38:25.488
And if they are, it'll work.

38:26.128 --> 38:33.516
But the judgment as to whether the book's any good when it comes in is a sort of, usually in my terms, a sort of common man's judgment.

38:33.536 --> 38:34.256
Yes, it's literate.

38:34.277 --> 38:36.319
Yes, it seems to touch the bases.

38:36.339 --> 38:37.620
Yes, it's witty.

38:38.080 --> 38:39.622
It's stylish.

38:39.642 --> 38:40.663
It's whatever.

38:40.883 --> 38:41.484
We'll publish it.

38:41.504 --> 38:42.625
But with an academic book,

38:42.757 --> 38:44.319
It's more difficult than that.

38:44.339 --> 38:57.095
You've got to know whether he really or she really has seen all the right archives and read all the right articles and thought all the appropriate thoughts.

38:57.115 --> 39:04.485
And that's a pretty tricky game, especially when it's an area you don't know anything about, which basically one doesn't.

39:04.505 --> 39:10.232
So, you know, someone's writing a history of Byzantia or something.

39:10.904 --> 39:36.287
or particularly a social history of you know some aspects of the ottoman or by the entire administration into eastern anatolia between 1100 and 1200 who's going to tell you whether what they say is um is worth publishing and that is quite tricky and i don't know but i think i would probably know who i could ring

39:36.672 --> 39:43.855
who would tell me who would know who, and then you have to make a judgment about how good that judgment is.

39:43.875 --> 39:49.332
But I mean, what I always did, and it's just funny, because there's a conflict with what the Yale Convention was.

39:49.497 --> 39:59.952
I used to use a very small circle of advisers who would tell me what they thought was good, and who they thought was good, and usually... From here?

39:59.972 --> 40:01.074
From the UK?

40:01.494 --> 40:01.674
Yeah.

40:02.095 --> 40:06.922
Oh, mostly, because that's why most of my contacts were not entirely, no, some of them in America.

40:06.942 --> 40:13.311
But they would usually be pretty kind of curt and perpetuity about it and say, you know, Smith is...

40:13.291 --> 40:18.977
is good, he's doing interesting work, and you should certainly publish anything that he does.

40:18.997 --> 40:35.075
And I can remember the time of hysterics who were in New Haven when I would produce a written report because they would say, the publication's because he doesn't explain why he thinks Smith is any good, he doesn't say why he's doing interesting work, he doesn't demonstrate this at all, how can we take his opinion seriously?

40:35.095 --> 40:40.581
And you say, well, because his name's Isaiah Berlin or something, and they would say, well, I'd rather have

40:40.915 --> 40:44.842
a properly argued case from a person from somewhere else.

40:45.322 --> 40:54.618
And I used to have to plead with my advisors sometimes to at least get their reports over to the second side of the sheet of paper so that Carol looked as they had done their homework.

40:55.019 --> 40:56.241
But that was...

40:56.660 --> 41:05.572
How I didn't answer this was by sort of getting what I thought was good advice.

41:05.632 --> 41:11.740
So you spent at least half your life with Gail, 30 years?

41:11.920 --> 41:16.286
Yeah, 30 years, from 73 to 2002.

41:16.746 --> 41:17.908
Did you enjoy it?

41:18.142 --> 41:19.586
Oh, was it 2002?

41:19.627 --> 41:20.931
No, 2003.

41:20.951 --> 41:21.191
No, 2004.

41:21.211 --> 41:24.201
Only one year.

41:25.665 --> 41:27.210
Oh yeah, I had a fantastic time.

41:27.290 --> 41:28.594
And I loved it.

41:28.614 --> 41:30.219
I was very, very lucky.

41:30.239 --> 41:31.543
And what could be nicer than having

41:31.945 --> 41:39.134
a wealthy benevolent benign owner who's 3,000 miles away.

41:39.154 --> 41:39.695
That's great.

41:41.137 --> 41:42.318
I love it.

41:42.359 --> 41:47.105
Now, how often did you have to go to New Haven?

41:47.165 --> 41:47.746
Was that fun?

41:47.766 --> 41:49.027
Was that interesting?

41:49.788 --> 41:50.850
It reminds me of Chester.

41:51.791 --> 41:52.772
Chester hired me.

41:53.596 --> 41:58.582
I had to say to him, I didn't sort of think CIA people used to it, it's just I got a confession to me.

41:58.602 --> 41:59.703
So what's a confession?

41:59.723 --> 42:01.986
It's that I'm too frightened to get in an aeroplane.

42:02.006 --> 42:04.248
I'm not prepared to come to America.

42:04.488 --> 42:05.429
Oh, you said this.

42:05.449 --> 42:06.451
Oh, were you serious?

42:06.531 --> 42:07.712
Oh yeah, absolutely.

42:07.732 --> 42:11.476
I'm not prepared to come to America on an airplane.

42:11.496 --> 42:14.560
I'm only prepared to take this problem.

42:14.700 --> 42:15.621
So if I can come by ship.

42:16.040 --> 42:20.466
So he said, well, that's ridiculous.

42:20.567 --> 42:23.170
And that's how it is.

42:23.351 --> 42:24.512
And for me, it's not negotiable.

42:24.672 --> 42:30.881
So he took his, I suppose, credit, but maybe not.

42:30.901 --> 42:34.867
He said, OK, and he put it in my little conditions.

42:34.887 --> 42:36.610
This is in the 70s, too.

42:36.730 --> 42:37.912
That's right.

42:37.932 --> 42:39.113
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:39.133 --> 42:40.415
And of course, what was clever?

42:40.435 --> 42:41.256
I'm not talking VC3.

42:41.737 --> 42:42.879
No, no, no.

42:44.161 --> 42:45.102
I guess he knew.

42:45.487 --> 42:50.793
and maybe I knew that he knew, that I wasn't always getting serious about this.

42:50.853 --> 42:55.318
I mean, I was serious, but I think he knew that I would back down on it.

42:55.338 --> 42:56.239
And I did.

42:57.140 --> 42:58.561
And I forced myself to fly.

42:58.681 --> 43:00.303
So how often did you go?

43:00.463 --> 43:01.724
So about four times a year.

43:01.745 --> 43:01.985
Really?

43:03.146 --> 43:05.469
What were they like?

43:05.569 --> 43:06.490
Did you dread them?

43:06.510 --> 43:07.471
Did you enjoy them?

43:07.491 --> 43:09.493
Well, I hated flying, but I got used to it after a bit.

43:09.673 --> 43:14.278
I had a very close friend who hated flying too, and he used to swap anecdotes.

43:14.461 --> 43:18.005
You would not have wanted to be on the planet last night.

43:18.206 --> 43:24.273
We just went from 40,000 feet to 28,000 feet to just kind of fine and comfortable.

43:24.373 --> 43:26.315
It was bumpy all the way.

43:26.335 --> 43:30.060
Not all the way, but where it wasn't, where it was bumpy, it was bumpy.

43:30.140 --> 43:31.802
I'm fairly relaxed about flying now.

43:31.822 --> 43:37.549
It was just so... But it was a...

43:38.558 --> 43:46.249
a period of my life where I was very, very... apprehensive about it.

43:46.270 --> 43:49.675
I know all the Iraq policies and everything, but I certainly do now.

43:49.695 --> 43:50.035
I did them.

43:50.776 --> 43:53.781
But what did I think of going there?

43:53.801 --> 43:54.462
I hated the flying.

43:55.043 --> 43:58.167
And, well, you've been to New Haven.

43:58.187 --> 43:59.710
Oh, I've lived 90 years.

43:59.730 --> 44:00.992
Well, that's decent history.

44:01.012 --> 44:04.697
That's one of the reasons I didn't agree to do this like this.

44:05.298 --> 44:08.042
I'd first been to New Haven before I...

44:08.360 --> 44:09.102
I joined the press.

44:09.202 --> 44:12.711
I had been there when I worked for Oxford, and I'd been there as a student.

44:12.791 --> 44:19.669
I hadn't studied there, but as a student I'd gone to America and I'd binged me home.

44:20.003 --> 44:23.369
It's not really the Athens of the East Coast.

44:23.469 --> 44:30.661
It's certainly not the... I always find it a very depressing place.

44:30.821 --> 44:37.412
Parts of it are nice, but the demographics have become such that it's really very scary.

44:37.432 --> 44:38.434
I think they've always been.

44:38.600 --> 44:40.506
I mean, I first went there in 66, 67.

44:40.887 --> 44:42.552
And it seemed pretty scary then.

44:42.572 --> 44:43.515
They were burning it down.

44:43.675 --> 44:49.051
I mean, every year you can count on at least one male student being murdered by a county.

44:50.435 --> 44:50.736
Yeah.

44:51.053 --> 44:52.155
That's scary.

44:52.175 --> 44:53.196
Yeah, it is.

44:53.216 --> 44:56.020
I have two daughters, you know, college graduates.

44:56.040 --> 45:02.489
No, not at Yale, but, you know, Tufts and Smith.

45:02.689 --> 45:06.174
But, you know, it's like going to Columbia, you know.

45:06.234 --> 45:08.798
Columbia is a great school, but we'll go where it is.

45:08.818 --> 45:11.562
But Columbia is at least in New York.

45:11.582 --> 45:12.924
You go on the subway in some minutes.

45:12.944 --> 45:13.745
That's right.

45:13.845 --> 45:17.130
Well, we can get up for, you know, 1.35 or whatever it is.

45:17.150 --> 45:19.373
But, no, Yale is, I love Yale.

45:19.353 --> 45:22.437
I don't know.

45:22.458 --> 45:35.456
A lot of people at Yale were extremely nice to me and gave me a very good time and interesting time and fun time.

45:35.476 --> 45:43.528
I had my share of people who were arrogant and difficult in the way that you would in any university.

45:43.668 --> 45:46.913
I don't have any huge affection for us in the institution because I don't

45:47.180 --> 45:51.407
I just used to go there for two or three days and then come back.

45:51.427 --> 45:53.190
Actually, my affection is for the press.

45:53.330 --> 45:56.615
Oh, the press is slightly different.

45:56.635 --> 45:57.156
Well, it is.

45:57.517 --> 46:01.022
In fact, for half of its existence, it wasn't even owned by the university.

46:01.403 --> 46:03.206
Well, it was.

46:03.426 --> 46:09.576
They gave it to the university in return for the freehold on that property, isn't it?

46:09.944 --> 46:11.506
It was a private corporation.

46:11.526 --> 46:15.951
I mean, the first guy, only for 50 or 60 years has it been part of the university.

46:15.971 --> 46:20.736
Gaddis Smith is doing a history of the university, and he's not including the press.

46:21.757 --> 46:22.518
And I said, why not?

46:22.538 --> 46:36.073
He said, well, it's only, you know, he told me a few things he thought I should look at, you know, a couple of political, a couple of books that were published in the 1930s that would never be published.

46:36.093 --> 46:37.234
I mean, they were really,

46:37.433 --> 46:41.579
covered this anti-Franklin Roosevelt polemics.

46:42.019 --> 46:42.580
Oh, really?

46:43.161 --> 46:46.085
Leave it to the historian to give me that.

46:46.105 --> 46:47.207
I said, check this out.

46:47.227 --> 46:48.188
It should be in there.

46:48.208 --> 46:51.292
So I think it's going to be a fun little book.

46:51.372 --> 46:52.955
I'm going to have fun for that.

46:52.975 --> 46:56.379
As I said, I live 90 minutes from the place.

46:57.942 --> 47:00.826
I drive down there to do two or three interviews.

47:00.906 --> 47:03.509
They gave me graduate students.

47:03.650 --> 47:04.671
This is unprecedented.

47:04.931 --> 47:05.432
Who's that?

47:05.817 --> 47:07.299
I don't even know how to use her.

47:07.542 --> 47:08.638
So what does she do?

47:09.007 --> 47:17.677
Yes, I've been told that, but I've forgotten that.

47:17.817 --> 47:31.312
Well, Bennett Cerf had given his word to you, John O'Neill, that he wouldn't publish this, because it's so autobiographical.

47:31.392 --> 47:36.398
And then he died, and then the widow said, well, we're going to do it.

47:36.631 --> 47:38.295
through his words of, well, I can't do it.

47:38.936 --> 47:44.269
So Neil, which had the book, said, well, we can do it.

47:44.930 --> 47:45.752
And they did in that book.

47:45.772 --> 47:47.556
That's their best-selling book.

47:47.656 --> 47:48.999
Absolutely.

47:49.019 --> 47:50.022
I wish we had the UK rise.

47:50.924 --> 47:51.906
But we never did.

47:52.207 --> 47:53.408
You sold the drunken cake.

47:56.472 --> 48:01.317
Anyway, very, very... I interrupted you.

48:01.337 --> 48:02.899
What were we talking about?

48:02.919 --> 48:04.020
We were talking about printing.

48:04.401 --> 48:05.582
No.

48:05.602 --> 48:05.842
No.

48:05.962 --> 48:07.364
Acquiring books.

48:07.684 --> 48:13.271
And I was just saying it was... Did you ever do textbooks?

48:13.291 --> 48:17.235
Did you ever feel that you should... I totally shouldn't.

48:17.840 --> 48:24.306
But John said that's one of the things that Yale did, that textbooks, art books,

48:24.573 --> 48:48.353
and what was the other thing three things that yale did which is uh well did you feel that you should be supporting any kind of a curriculum or anything like that so basically the name is of the university press that you can largely proceed

48:48.907 --> 48:50.591
As far as I was concerned, it was all tertiary levels.

48:50.671 --> 48:51.372
Publishing.

48:51.392 --> 48:52.014
Yeah.

48:52.394 --> 48:52.495
Yeah.

48:52.515 --> 48:59.509
And it was publishing at a fairly serious level for academics and for the interested general reader.

48:59.529 --> 49:00.612
It was not for students.

49:00.632 --> 49:03.498
I'm looking at it as a title, but actually, that's worth it.

49:03.518 --> 49:03.898
Keep going.

49:04.540 --> 49:06.544
Sorry, I've finished, I think.

49:07.452 --> 49:09.635
Publishing at a fairly serious level.

49:09.775 --> 49:10.976
That's not bad, is it?

49:10.996 --> 49:13.960
Well, no, it could do.

49:14.040 --> 49:14.861
It's a bit English.

49:14.941 --> 49:15.883
It's double negative.

49:16.123 --> 49:17.685
We can work it.

49:18.887 --> 49:24.614
I really need to settle it.

49:24.874 --> 49:26.596
That's what I thought we were trying to do.

49:26.716 --> 49:36.649
And this is where one comes back to the... We're trying to keep the show on the road, but trying to justify the charitable status, as it were, that one...

49:36.815 --> 49:38.957
Now, you went to Oxford.

49:38.977 --> 49:39.858
I did, yeah.

49:40.058 --> 49:42.200
And you worked for the press.

49:42.360 --> 49:59.256
I left the Claremont Press, which I think was quite a good, gave me quite a good grounding in academic publishing and its kind of conventional sort of practices and sort of principles.

49:59.476 --> 50:04.341
But do you have a process to what a university press ought to be?

50:04.760 --> 50:08.885
I think I know that I don't know what universities are supposed to be.

50:08.905 --> 50:10.287
I mean, I have thought about it quite hard.

50:10.668 --> 50:19.239
And I think I know that no one at Yale ever really wanted to talk about it, I think, because... Sorry, I'm not supposed to interrupt you.

50:19.259 --> 50:31.274
No, but I... And I can see why they didn't want to talk about it, because it would beg all kinds of questions about what we did and why we did it and whether we should be doing it.

50:31.294 --> 50:33.417
And it was much easier just to...

50:33.835 --> 50:36.940
point to the books and say, well, that's a pretty distinguished collection.

50:36.960 --> 50:39.563
And looking back... Oh, my proper picture.

50:40.024 --> 50:40.344
No, don't.

50:40.485 --> 50:41.046
Well, me.

50:41.066 --> 50:42.468
Yeah.

50:42.488 --> 50:44.010
Everywhere.

50:44.611 --> 50:46.193
I have everything.

50:46.293 --> 50:46.914
Okay.

50:47.215 --> 50:56.468
It was much easier for everyone to point to the books and say, that's a pretty distinguished collection of books and only 10% of them do we need to be ashamed of and another...

50:56.785 --> 51:01.691
10% we need to kind of perhaps have reservations about.

51:01.891 --> 51:09.780
And it's really difficult to ask the questions, or to answer the questions, as to why did you think this one was worth doing?

51:09.800 --> 51:11.582
And was it really worth doing?

51:11.602 --> 51:13.604
Because perhaps it wasn't.

51:14.325 --> 51:21.793
And those are the questions that I think nobody wanted to have raised, not least me.

51:21.813 --> 51:26.218
I mean, I wouldn't particularly want to have to justify every book that I did.

51:26.485 --> 51:31.577
And you publish a lot of books because you couldn't think of a decent reason not to publish them, actually.

51:31.597 --> 51:36.269
The author was personable, the subject was self-evidently kind of interesting to somebody.

51:37.131 --> 51:38.614
It appeared as though it was going to be a good book.

51:38.634 --> 51:39.577
It obviously was a good book.

51:40.078 --> 51:43.887
As far as you can tell, you're going to sell some, so why not publish it?

51:44.221 --> 51:58.268
And it was never, there was never the time, I mean, it's not like HarperCollins, or Darlene Kindersley, where you are not going to do a book unless you think you're going to sell 10,000 copies, and I hope you're going to sell 100,000 copies.

51:58.288 --> 52:03.057
You can spend a lot of time discussing

52:03.593 --> 52:12.503
whether you should do this or that, whether this really is satisfactory and sufficient, because there is enough time, there's enough revenue there to support that kind of time.

52:12.563 --> 52:15.146
Editors don't need to be particularly productive.

52:15.726 --> 52:18.049
10, 15 books a year is probably enough.

52:18.069 --> 52:26.298
With the university press, actually, you have to keep cranking the stuff out, because a lot of these books are going to sell 500,000 copies.

52:26.859 --> 52:29.321
Many of them have a $25 price point, or less.

52:29.582 --> 52:32.605
They're not going to earn much money for anybody.

52:33.007 --> 52:45.342
So unless you do quite a lot, the economics really aren't spout, and if you're going to do quite a lot, you've got to take decisions quite quickly.

52:46.123 --> 52:54.753
You can't spend too long debating whether it's quite good enough or quite the right subject or the best book that could be written on the subject.

52:55.013 --> 52:59.098
You just have to say yes or no.

52:59.585 --> 53:00.807
I think that's being realistic.

53:01.288 --> 53:05.454
I don't know what the university press is for.

53:05.474 --> 53:07.497
I see it as a department of the university.

53:07.717 --> 53:13.926
At some level, it exists to publish research emanating from the university and the published books.

53:14.127 --> 53:16.570
Something has to distinguish it from the trade.

53:17.532 --> 53:18.974
Otherwise, what's its reason for being?

53:21.397 --> 53:24.562
I'm not in the business of founding university presses.

53:24.582 --> 53:27.507
If you were to set up a new university and say, should it have a university press?

53:27.547 --> 53:28.528
But they all exist.

53:28.610 --> 53:30.512
I mean, you know, that's... They've evolved.

53:30.532 --> 53:41.185
I mean, according to John, again, Wright, you know, the American University Press begins at about the same time that you have the professionalization of scholarship in the United States.

53:42.387 --> 53:44.530
And it's served a function there.

53:45.631 --> 53:48.234
That's not necessarily the case anymore.

53:48.274 --> 53:53.461
I mean, Yale doesn't even... I mean, if you're a Yale professor, that may go against you trying to get your book.

53:53.481 --> 53:54.702
Yeah, that was...

53:54.884 --> 53:56.006
That's new.

53:56.026 --> 53:58.249
When I started, it counted in your favour.

53:58.269 --> 54:00.753
I thought that was a very bad thing.

54:00.773 --> 54:04.959
I think it should probably count against you.

54:04.999 --> 54:08.625
Do you think it probably should count against you?

54:08.645 --> 54:10.788
Well, I'm joking, but it should be difficult.

54:10.808 --> 54:13.111
It certainly shouldn't count in your favour, actually.

54:13.131 --> 54:18.900
I think the press should be completely indifferent, in the same way that I wouldn't give

54:19.218 --> 54:43.791
preference to um the children of the one night. Otherwise it looks like a vanity press. Exactly. It is what may be true is that there are certain strengths in the university, certain bits of the university that have ongoing programs or what have you that the press is bought into and that's fine. I don't have problems about that, but if it's just any old history professor who's written any old history book then I don't have any um because if once that happens I mean

54:44.075 --> 54:50.724
One of the issues at Oxford, which I think they handled quite well, which is 35 years ago, was maintaining a distance from the university.

54:50.745 --> 54:55.471
And they were very... I suppose I kind of put that in a bit with my training.

54:55.672 --> 55:12.175
But keeping one's distance from the university was very important because if they thought they had you in that pocket, there were a lot of very powerful people, very ambitious, very ruthless, who would have no compunction about taking advantage of it.

55:12.526 --> 55:13.909
And one had to be careful about that.

55:14.270 --> 55:19.541
When I joined Yale, I felt that was not something that people were worried about anything like enough.

55:19.741 --> 55:30.884
And it seemed to me there was clear evidence of second-rate books, or third-rate books, being published because they were written by the student of a professor and so on.

55:30.904 --> 55:32.307
And I thought, that's no way to...

55:32.472 --> 55:37.116
he hopes to run an academic company.

55:37.136 --> 55:37.937
In my view of that.

55:37.957 --> 55:38.778
Sure, they are.

55:38.798 --> 55:40.259
And there are always going to be some of them.

55:40.359 --> 55:41.600
And they're always worthless books.

55:41.620 --> 55:47.125
But if you publish a worthless book on the stage... That's where the internet can really do something good.

55:47.425 --> 55:49.728
Well, it can't stop you publishing worthless books.

55:49.748 --> 55:54.232
But at least it provides a way to get their things done.

55:54.252 --> 56:02.479
Well, that's $150 to buy a stupid little monograph that... Of course.

56:02.459 --> 56:11.158
But the distinction is between the monograph that no one's ever going to read, which they should read, and those which they're absolutely right not to read.

56:11.599 --> 56:18.615
And the tricky bit is that, you know, you're the fancy professor, and this is your possibly glamorous blonde student who's written the monograph.

56:18.635 --> 56:20.198
Very good.

56:20.532 --> 56:28.128
I'll have a double espresso.

56:28.208 --> 56:29.812
Just regular, Joe.

56:30.694 --> 56:36.145
I hesitate to call it American coffee.

56:36.631 --> 56:42.936
But that's where a university press is kind of special.

56:44.097 --> 56:56.328
You can afford to spend money on books that people won't buy, and you think, well, I've done a good thing.

56:56.548 --> 57:01.012
But of course, if you do it on books people should never have bought, then it's a complete waste.

57:02.613 --> 57:06.216
But I mean, there are some issues there that I, to be honest, have never

57:06.533 --> 57:09.256
properly addressed because it gets quite uncomfortable.

57:09.997 --> 57:11.739
It's a bit like charity, triage.

57:11.779 --> 57:14.702
What are some of the issues that you've never properly addressed?

57:14.742 --> 57:17.825
Well, the issues of just what is the university press for?

57:18.486 --> 57:19.467
That's a good question.

57:19.487 --> 57:19.927
Yeah, exactly.

57:19.947 --> 57:21.689
And I've never addressed it.

57:22.450 --> 57:24.092
It's there to promote sponsorship and so on.

57:24.132 --> 57:29.698
But just how does it do it and how does it differentiate itself from a commercial publisher?

57:29.758 --> 57:35.344
And if it only publishes the books that are uneconomic, that's fair enough.

57:35.364 --> 57:35.764
But then it's

57:36.048 --> 57:58.225
it's it's really a and that's not publishing that's kind of charity that's um that's oxfam it's feeding and starving and people who can't cope and this odd sort of conjunction of business and sort of entrepreneurship and um scholarship is is um it's eccentric and it's

57:58.441 --> 57:59.843
It's tricky.

57:59.863 --> 58:02.208
Maybe it's better if it's a private corporation.

58:02.228 --> 58:08.699
What's remarkable to see is that you're a publisher and you happen to have worked for a university.

58:08.719 --> 58:13.588
That's a nice flashing thing to say, but I suppose, yeah, I mean, I would like to think of myself.

58:14.169 --> 58:16.112
My conclusion, I'm writing a book.

58:16.092 --> 58:22.068
And this is what maybe makes you so refreshing on the scene.

58:22.689 --> 58:25.035
I don't mean to flatter you here.

58:25.055 --> 58:31.131
I'm trying to come up with something here, which...

58:31.111 --> 58:39.660
I mean, you've had university presses here for half a millennia.

58:40.080 --> 58:41.562
We've only had them.

58:41.642 --> 58:46.687
Yale is celebrating its centennial in 08, and it's the third and oldest in the U.S.

58:46.707 --> 58:47.668
by two or three years.

58:47.688 --> 58:52.493
Hopkins, Chicago, Princeton, Columbia, Yale.

58:53.013 --> 58:53.814
That's about it.

58:53.834 --> 58:55.836
A hundred years old.

58:56.356 --> 59:05.952
To be realistic, Oxford and Cambridge, before 1908, weren't really university presses as we know them.

59:05.972 --> 59:06.212
Really?

59:06.933 --> 59:21.317
Well, a lot of Bibles and a few sort of Greek-Aladdin texts, I don't think people like Macaulay and so on didn't publish their books with Oxford in the 1860s, and John Stuart Mill,

59:21.702 --> 59:32.895
Ruskin and... Actually Ruskin, funny enough, did publish one of his books at the Oxford University Press because he gave it as the Slade Lectures and the Slade Lectures were published by the OEP.

59:32.916 --> 59:38.582
If you look at the serious books published in Britain in the late 19th century, they were by and large published by Oxford and Cambridge.

59:39.203 --> 59:40.925
I think that's probably after the First War.

59:41.185 --> 59:42.948
So they were all moving at the same time then?

59:42.968 --> 59:44.149
I would say so, yeah.

59:44.433 --> 59:50.198
Clarendon's history of the Great Rebellion, which financed the Clarendon press, was a... So what's driving it at that point?

59:50.218 --> 59:51.819
It's the professionalisation of academic life.

59:51.839 --> 59:53.701
So it's the same thing here as it is in the US?

59:54.121 --> 59:54.401
I think so.

59:54.422 --> 59:54.902
I think so.

59:54.922 --> 59:57.264
I hadn't actually thought that before, but I suspect that's right.

59:57.284 --> 59:59.085
So that's a good point, did he make?

59:59.106 --> 01:00:00.807
Yes, I think so.

01:00:00.827 --> 01:00:02.348
Plus a few odd individuals.

01:00:02.428 --> 01:00:13.798
I mean, the OUP had a rather... It had Chapman and Sison, who were both energetic, sort of, academics, monquet.
