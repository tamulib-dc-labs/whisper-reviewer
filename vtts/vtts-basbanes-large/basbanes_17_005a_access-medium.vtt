00:01.465 --> 00:06.091
The commission oversees a 10-year-old salmon treaty between the U.S.

00:06.132 --> 00:06.692
and Canada.

00:07.253 --> 00:15.725
On Wednesday, Alaska officials will try to persuade a federal court judge in Seattle to lift a temporary restraining order she imposed on the fishery earlier this month.

00:16.266 --> 00:23.796
In a preliminary decision, the judge agreed with Canada, Oregon, and Washington that Alaska's harvest violates the terms of the U.S.-Canada treaty.

00:24.337 --> 00:28.603
In Wednesday's hearing, she'll decide whether to lift the restraining order or issue an injunction.

00:29.005 --> 00:31.935
Alaska officials will challenge her jurisdiction in the case.

00:32.316 --> 00:36.230
They say SAMA disputes should be resolved through the treaty process, not the courts.

00:36.792 --> 00:40.585
If Alaska loses, it vows to take the case to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

00:40.953 --> 00:44.158
For National Public Radio, I'm Paula Dobbin in Juneau.

00:44.178 --> 00:48.265
The conference board today reported little change in consumer confidence in August.

00:48.606 --> 00:52.072
Confidence rose briskly in July but fell slightly in August.

00:52.713 --> 01:01.407
Improved consumer confidence is considered crucial to an economic recovery because consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's total economic activity.

01:01.908 --> 01:04.412
This is National Public Radio News from Washington.

01:16.002 --> 01:16.503
Welcome.

01:17.686 --> 01:18.749
I'm Jean Faraca.

01:18.769 --> 01:21.876
This is the Ideas Network of Wisconsin Public Radio.

01:24.683 --> 01:26.266
Have you ever stolen a book?

01:27.489 --> 01:31.659
If the answer is yes, you may find yourself in good company.

01:32.902 --> 01:33.724
On the other hand,

01:34.244 --> 01:48.568
You may find yourself among the deranged and literary individuals who have exchanged the common pleasures of the nearly human for the collector's exalted and insatiate passion.

01:48.588 --> 01:58.885
The passion for collecting books is documented richly in a book that is itself

02:00.350 --> 02:01.211
What shall I say?

02:01.652 --> 02:02.453
Covetable.

02:03.715 --> 02:09.864
It's called A Gentle Madness, and it's by Nicholas Bestbanes.

02:10.264 --> 02:19.578
Nicholas Bestbanes is former literary editor of the Worcester Sunday Telegram and now a nationally syndicated columnist.

02:20.740 --> 02:28.551
He is the author of this beautiful book, A Gentle Madness, Bibliophiles, Bibliomains, and the Eternal Passion for Books.

02:29.527 --> 02:34.714
He joins us by telephone from Massachusetts to talk about all this.

02:35.115 --> 02:35.475
Welcome.

02:36.096 --> 02:36.296
Thank you.

02:36.316 --> 02:36.777
Good morning.

02:38.119 --> 02:40.883
I have to share something with you.

02:41.323 --> 02:50.636
Attached to my copy of your book was a little stick-on note that said, please save this book.

02:51.257 --> 02:52.158
I want to keep it.

02:52.178 --> 02:53.019
I love it.

02:54.061 --> 02:54.641
That's wonderful.

02:54.661 --> 02:56.404
Thank you.

02:56.424 --> 02:57.245
Wonderful compliment.

02:57.445 --> 02:58.707
Yes, indeed.

03:00.931 --> 03:14.973
You claim in the book that if it weren't for those among us who are afflicted with this particular form of madness, we wouldn't really have the culture that we do.

03:16.355 --> 03:24.287
I believe that to be true, not only at points during this century, but throughout history, the history of culture.

03:24.327 --> 03:29.014
I think I discovered this dramatically during a visit

03:29.770 --> 03:52.913
to the British Library, oh, it must be 10 years ago, and walking through that wonderful reading room of King George's, it's called King George's Library, and going up to what is known as English Literature, and seeing in that display case of nine items, five, fully five, that were preserved by a book collector, Sir Robert Cotton.

03:52.933 --> 03:58.258
They included Beowulf, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Piers Plowman,

03:58.593 --> 04:04.179
These are the only known copies of these precious artifacts, and they were preserved by a book collector.

04:04.960 --> 04:11.267
And you see this dramatically in the British Library, and if you study, you'll find many, many other cases throughout history.

04:11.307 --> 04:22.980
You'll find Poggio Bracciolini, for instance, during the period of humanism saving Quintilian, and you'll find even modest cases like Francis Parkman, the historian going south,

04:23.500 --> 04:26.567
towards the end of the Civil War to preserve Confederate imprints.

04:26.707 --> 04:38.793
So you just find many, many cases of this, of a collector who sees some value in preserving things, and for later generations to say, wow, we wouldn't have this stuff if it weren't for these collectors.

04:38.973 --> 04:43.483
And what I tried to do is to document as many cases of these as I could.

04:44.088 --> 04:49.815
What makes a book collector different from other kinds of collectors?

04:50.195 --> 04:54.260
And what distinguishes this particular form of madness?

04:54.621 --> 05:00.948
And how would you convince someone that it is, in fact, a form of madness?

05:01.609 --> 05:04.292
Well, I think I use the phrase madness.

05:04.392 --> 05:10.720
I hope the tongue is perceived to be placed firmly in my cheek.

05:10.919 --> 05:17.466
On the other hand, in the case of somebody like Don Vincente... Exactly, of course.

05:17.486 --> 05:22.911
There's no question that there are many examples of pathology.

05:23.872 --> 05:24.713
I'm not a physician.

05:24.773 --> 05:25.514
I'm not an M.D.

05:25.794 --> 05:33.241
I certainly do see, however, some value in citing cases of excess.

05:34.022 --> 05:36.905
But I think the key word in my subtitle is passion.

05:38.006 --> 05:40.048
These people are passionate about books.

05:40.737 --> 05:48.208
It is, as I point out, I think, the only hobby that has a disease named after it, which is bibliomania.

05:49.209 --> 05:54.396
And I tried very hard to trace the origin of that word, and it goes back several hundred years.

05:54.416 --> 06:09.057
I just don't see any other instance in stamp collecting or coin collecting or rock collecting or any other hobby that you can think of where it has reached such a degree over such a long period of time

06:09.577 --> 06:15.402
where you actually have a disease named after it, and it has been written in several medical journals.

06:15.462 --> 06:19.706
The Journal of the American Medical Association had an essay which I quote in my Chapter 1.

06:20.486 --> 06:21.167
It's just different.

06:22.108 --> 06:25.911
So are we going to see support groups for bibliomaniacs?

06:26.051 --> 06:34.578
The problem, I think, is that those of us who recognize that we have this malady feel that we don't want any help.

06:34.598 --> 06:39.162
I think that's one of the problems, is that perhaps you could treat it and...

06:39.412 --> 06:41.655
and devise these support groups.

06:41.736 --> 06:47.604
But all the people that I know who are afflicted with it are rather pleased to be so afflicted.

06:47.865 --> 06:48.906
Are you a bibliomaniac?

06:49.567 --> 06:55.837
I like to say that I'm on the cusp, but we have a quote early on.

06:55.937 --> 07:01.666
The bibliomaniac is the slave of his books, the bibliophile, the master.

07:03.068 --> 07:06.533
However, we also say you don't really ever know when you cross that line.

07:07.171 --> 07:09.314
I have collected things all my life.

07:10.496 --> 07:12.239
As every kid does, I guess.

07:12.299 --> 07:17.948
I collected baseball cards and bottle caps and stones and rocks that I found at the beach.

07:17.988 --> 07:18.408
Who knows?

07:19.390 --> 07:23.737
But books did kind of take over 20, 25 years ago.

07:23.757 --> 07:29.746
It was concurrent, I guess, with my getting this book editor's position in Massachusetts.

07:31.028 --> 07:32.250
And as you know, of course, we

07:33.023 --> 07:38.088
get all these review books, these wonderful books from publishers to read and to review.

07:38.129 --> 07:46.758
One thing I did from the very beginning, I've always done perhaps as many as 900 author interviews over the last 18 years.

07:46.898 --> 07:51.283
And from the very beginning, I always ask these authors to inscribe my books.

07:52.024 --> 07:59.892
And so I have now, I guess, somewhere between 1,500 and 2,000 inscribed books by authors

08:00.344 --> 08:04.129
that I've interviewed over the years, wonderful books, and it makes it kind of a unique collection.

08:04.329 --> 08:06.993
And the inscription makes the book automatically more valuable?

08:07.013 --> 08:09.877
I absolutely believe so.

08:09.897 --> 08:16.165
There's one school of thought that says a book is more valuable if it's just signed by the author.

08:16.846 --> 08:17.687
I tend to disagree.

08:17.767 --> 08:18.889
I like something personal.

08:19.049 --> 08:22.474
What's more valuable, a letter from somebody or a signature from someone?

08:22.494 --> 08:28.081
I think if an author writes something personal in a book, it has more meaning.

08:28.101 --> 08:29.423
Now, value, of course, is a

08:29.858 --> 08:31.000
It's a personal thing.

08:31.120 --> 08:39.113
I never collected any of these books with the idea or acquired any of these books with the idea that they would have a market value, a monetary value.

08:39.273 --> 08:40.515
The value to me is personal.

08:41.256 --> 08:46.304
However, a few of them I would also probably venture would have some value in the marketplace.

08:46.324 --> 08:50.190
Well, what makes a book, in your view, desirable?

08:51.212 --> 08:53.135
Scarcity, of course, number one.

08:53.997 --> 08:55.579
The fact that it's desirable.

08:56.183 --> 09:07.655
I once asked a bookseller from Quaritch in England why a particular copy of Don Quixote went up to close to $2 million at a sale when the pre-sale estimate was $600,000.

09:07.815 --> 09:16.945
And he said, because you had two people who wanted one copy of a book, a book of which there was only one copy at that particular time.

09:17.566 --> 09:18.767
Two people wanted one book.

09:19.528 --> 09:26.055
Scarcity, desirability, significance, all these things, I guess, go into what makes a book valuable and desirable.

09:26.137 --> 09:28.600
How many books do you own?

09:29.601 --> 09:31.163
There are in the house, I guess.

09:33.806 --> 09:40.193
We estimate 15,000 books, but it could be over that or it could be under, I don't know.

09:41.714 --> 09:48.402
All of my books by no means are, I don't even really think that I have rare books per se.

09:48.442 --> 09:53.768
I have books that are meaningful to me, books that I love and books that I use in my work.

09:53.948 --> 09:54.709
I do write about

09:55.212 --> 10:01.258
books and authors, and so I have a collection that is quite focused.

10:01.278 --> 10:10.228
In fact, I think if you look at the bibliography of my book, A Gentle Madness, one of the subtexts here is that I think I own 95% of the books in the bibliography.

10:10.368 --> 10:22.401
A passion for me while researching this book was to acquire as many books as I could about library formation, book collecting, the history of books in general,

10:22.904 --> 10:23.725
all of these things.

10:23.925 --> 10:25.847
And it wasn't enough for me just to read them.

10:26.007 --> 10:30.711
You know, I think if I saw a beautiful book like Dibdin's Bibliomania, I had to have a copy of it.

10:32.532 --> 10:32.673
Mm-hmm.

10:32.693 --> 10:35.355
And so these are here, 15,000, I guess, give or take.

10:35.375 --> 10:41.380
I know my older daughter did say to me once, Daddy, if we ever move to another house, can I have my own books in my room?

10:41.440 --> 10:43.502
I mean, our books are all over the house.

10:44.763 --> 10:51.409
I think there are something like 36 bookcases, which is actually 72 because they're double-shelved.

10:52.013 --> 10:53.014
Do you know where everything is?

10:54.075 --> 10:56.137
Believe it or not, I believe that I do.

10:57.638 --> 11:00.320
And, of course, the next question always is, have you read all your books?

11:00.340 --> 11:01.181
Well, that's impossible.

11:01.441 --> 11:02.482
I would never ask you that.

11:03.764 --> 11:13.733
But I think what Winston Churchill says, I quote it in Chapter 1, it's not necessary for a person to have read every book that he or she owns.

11:13.893 --> 11:19.818
What is important is, number one, that you know what you have, you know how to lay your hands on it, and how it could help you when you need it.

11:19.918 --> 11:22.020
And I think that's a pretty good rule of thumb.

11:22.355 --> 11:30.428
I don't keep books that I'm not interested in any longer, that I have no expectation that I'll ever read or that can't help me in any way in my writing.

11:31.910 --> 11:47.434
In this day and age, when it's possible to access the Library of Congress through one's personal computer, doesn't a collection such as yours lose its value and take on a sense of burden?

11:48.308 --> 11:51.631
Well, to some sensibilities, perhaps.

11:52.151 --> 11:57.036
Can you actually access the entire Library of Congress, however, by computer?

11:57.076 --> 11:58.177
I don't know, as you can.

11:58.917 --> 12:01.860
You certainly might be able to find out what titles they have there.

12:01.920 --> 12:11.868
I know I can call Harvard University their online cataloging system, and I can certainly find out if they have a book there.

12:11.988 --> 12:14.090
I don't believe I can access that text.

12:14.751 --> 12:17.353
I'm not so sure that you ever will be able to do that.

12:18.008 --> 12:20.531
I always think that there'll be a place for books.

12:21.111 --> 12:25.696
I just can't believe that they're going to be replaced by computers.

12:25.716 --> 12:27.778
I certainly hope not, not in my lifetime.

12:28.799 --> 12:33.645
How does your personal library compare with that of, say, William Scheide?

12:35.587 --> 12:44.256
Well, William Scheide, I think, is the only person in the book who has to be in the book.

12:44.276 --> 12:46.378
Stephen Blumberg, for instance, the book thief,

12:47.017 --> 12:49.780
who is the centerpiece of Chapter 13.

12:49.820 --> 12:57.828
It's wonderful that he's in the book, but he wasn't even arrested until after I had signed a contract to write it.

12:57.848 --> 12:59.911
He appeared, and he had to be in there.

13:00.511 --> 13:14.526
However, a person like William Scheide, who is arguably the owner of the greatest private library in the world, and if you're going to write a book about the passion to collect books and significance, I think that

13:15.113 --> 13:20.762
It behooves you to have a William Scheide in there, and he gets a chapter entirely to himself.

13:21.523 --> 13:32.481
My collection, compared to his, I mean, it's... My collection, it's a library, it's a working writers, a journalist library that helps me, that pleases me, that gives me a great deal of pleasure.

13:33.463 --> 13:40.294
But you're talking about a library that has a Gutenberg Bible, every major important printed book that you could possibly think of.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.383
It's right there in Princeton, New Jersey.

13:43.403 --> 13:48.971
It's the most extraordinary thing I certainly have ever seen that's privately owned.

13:48.991 --> 13:58.083
About that Gutenberg Bible, he's quoted as saying, now one of the fun things I enjoy about this book very much is the hyphens, though the margins are wonderful, too.

13:59.665 --> 14:01.647
You have to get the context of that.

14:03.049 --> 14:05.613
He does say that, and I'm sure because you've read that.

14:05.633 --> 14:08.256
You know he proceeds at that point to explain

14:08.506 --> 14:10.189
why the hyphens are so wonderful.

14:10.349 --> 14:12.433
Every page, this is a large folio.

14:12.453 --> 14:19.224
This is the first book, or certainly one of the surviving copies of the first books ever printed with movable type.

14:19.925 --> 14:22.770
And what's really amazing is that every page is two columns.

14:23.311 --> 14:27.417
And no column on any page, and no page, ends in a hyphen.

14:28.038 --> 14:35.070
And what amazes him, and when he points it out to anyone who is privileged enough to be sitting with him at this table,

14:35.962 --> 14:40.326
is that page after page, column after column, you never see a word end in a hyphen.

14:40.407 --> 14:43.169
And he says, how they managed to do this is a marvel to him.

14:43.730 --> 14:49.556
And of course, then he goes on to the margins, because as you know, through history, books have been, many books have been rebound.

14:50.236 --> 14:55.422
We know, of course, that the most valuable books are the books that are in their original bindings.

14:55.502 --> 15:04.551
His Gutenberg Bible, which consists, by the way, of two volumes, the Old Testament and the New Testament, is in its original binding, and so therefore,

15:04.868 --> 15:06.430
margins have never been trimmed.

15:06.450 --> 15:19.892
They're huge, they're wide, and at the extreme side of each page, you'll see these, when he points them out to you, these little pinholes, and every page was pinned down by tacks on the press.

15:19.912 --> 15:28.565
You can touch these, and you can touch where a sheet of paper was pinned to a press, and the first type bit into paper for the first time.

15:28.585 --> 15:28.986
It's a

15:29.877 --> 15:42.807
for me i was light-headed with this happened with every biblio file it's ineffable i can't i can't describe it

15:43.293 --> 15:53.082
Well, but I'm going to probe a little bit here because I want to get a better sense myself, a more visceral sense of what you mean by that.

15:54.323 --> 16:05.314
Is it the connection, the sensual connection with a moment in the past that was so significant to the history of books?

16:05.614 --> 16:07.416
I think all of those things and more.

16:08.977 --> 16:09.958
When he took this...

16:10.850 --> 16:17.980
I think I described this moment briefly, but this Mr. Scheide is now about 80, I believe.

16:19.342 --> 16:24.489
And, well, he was showing me around his library, which is attached, by the way, to Princeton University.

16:24.509 --> 16:27.693
I suspect it's unique.

16:27.814 --> 16:32.520
I don't know of any other Ivy League institution or any other institution, for that matter, that

16:33.007 --> 16:41.256
that allows a private individual to construct his library as part of its own institutional library with no strings attached.

16:41.476 --> 16:41.937
It's there.

16:42.437 --> 16:45.481
What he chooses to do with it is something he will decide at some point.

16:46.802 --> 16:57.634
In any case, he went to this vault that he has in his library, and he took out this big box, and he was lumbering over to the table with it, and I asked if I could help, and he said, no, no, you stay right there.

16:58.635 --> 17:01.258
I didn't know what he had at that point, and when he opened the box,

17:02.032 --> 17:02.713
There it was.

17:02.733 --> 17:06.337
I knew instantly what he was showing me, and he wrapped it with his knuckles.

17:06.818 --> 17:11.624
There was one volume of the Gutenberg Bible, and I absolutely felt weak.

17:11.784 --> 17:13.906
He looked at me, and he said, it's on my tape.

17:14.007 --> 17:14.788
I taped everything.

17:14.808 --> 17:15.328
You can hear it.

17:15.348 --> 17:16.269
He said, are you okay?

17:17.311 --> 17:18.732
And I said, forgive me, sir.

17:19.673 --> 17:21.215
I have the same as moment.

17:21.315 --> 17:25.160
It was really quite a feeling, and I felt all sorts of things.

17:25.180 --> 17:26.041
It was physical.

17:26.221 --> 17:27.143
It was emotional.

17:27.343 --> 17:30.807
It was intellectual, sensual, perhaps, as you suggested.

17:31.563 --> 17:33.265
It was all of those things.

17:33.666 --> 17:34.266
It was wonderful.

17:34.687 --> 17:36.870
And you see this everywhere.

17:36.890 --> 17:39.794
I mean, you have people describing the moment.

17:39.934 --> 17:46.843
Sanford Berger out in California when he describes the first Kelmscott press book that he picked up and held.

17:46.923 --> 17:49.706
And he said he still gets shivers.

17:49.746 --> 17:50.287
He sweats.

17:50.367 --> 17:53.992
He broke into a cold sweat the first time he picked up this book.

17:54.012 --> 17:56.175
Carlton Lake down in Texas.

17:56.936 --> 17:57.977
He describes a feeling.

17:57.997 --> 18:00.220
He said he feels a message coming from the book.

18:00.520 --> 18:06.486
through his fingers and up his arms, and he almost hears this voice saying, is it good, is it not good?

18:06.606 --> 18:13.053
And I think any of your listeners out there who have feelings for books can empathize with us.

18:13.113 --> 18:15.856
It just happens, and I don't know if I can describe it.

18:16.096 --> 18:23.764
You're describing it beautifully, and it reminds me that people are really most alive through the things that they love.

18:24.665 --> 18:25.566
I couldn't agree more.

18:26.026 --> 18:26.907
I couldn't agree more.

18:26.947 --> 18:28.128
And it's things, too.

18:28.328 --> 18:29.389
There they are, inanimate.

18:29.690 --> 18:29.970
Yeah.

18:30.119 --> 18:39.070
So therefore... It's so funny that we think of things as inanimate when it's so obvious that we imbue them with life.

18:39.811 --> 18:42.174
You know, I'm thinking here, that's it exactly.

18:42.214 --> 18:44.276
They are inanimate, but they do have life.

18:45.137 --> 18:50.704
And what's wonderful about them, and what's wonderful, I guess, about the cycle of collecting, which I've tried.

18:50.764 --> 18:54.429
If there is a theme, it's the cycle in this book.

18:54.449 --> 18:55.350
It's these books...

18:56.140 --> 19:03.487
if they are taken care of properly with respect and with love and all these wonderful words, they go on.

19:03.547 --> 19:05.369
We're merely custodians of them.

19:05.389 --> 19:07.430
They are in our company for a while.

19:08.471 --> 19:11.254
And then we pass them on from generation to generation.

19:11.614 --> 19:14.637
Some go to institutions, others go to other owners.

19:14.797 --> 19:17.239
But it's really a wonderful feeling for me.

19:17.280 --> 19:20.102
I love my favorite places in the world.

19:20.162 --> 19:23.245
Wherever I go, whatever city it might be in the United States,

19:23.866 --> 19:50.397
i always seek out the secondhand bookstore uh... i'd love to go and and just find something old that's been kicking around and i love finding a book that i've never even heard of before i'd love traces of prior ownership i'd like to see a book plate or an inscription from an aunt to a to a niece at christmastime dated 1892 or whatever and you just feel these vibrations that

19:51.220 --> 20:00.852
that these people say they feel, and I feel it, and if I can buy this book or acquire this book and it enters my library for a period, I really feel wonderful about it.

20:02.414 --> 20:06.560
I hope I haven't gotten too discreet on the subject here.

20:06.580 --> 20:08.983
It's positively erotic.

20:09.664 --> 20:10.305
What can I say?

20:10.365 --> 20:10.845
It's true.

20:12.988 --> 20:20.738
I don't know if I'd use the word erotic, but it certainly is sensual, and you certainly acquire and develop a feeling for it.

20:21.173 --> 20:22.675
And I'm not so sure it's innate either.

20:22.695 --> 20:42.855
I don't know if it's passed on from generation to generation because you have so many cases where, I mean, I hate to be crude, but you'll have a person dead one day and barely resting in his grave where the heirs will be consigning these books off to the nearest auction house.

20:44.117 --> 20:48.261
And you've had many instances of that even within the last five or ten years

20:48.747 --> 20:57.277
where remarkable libraries never got beyond 12 months into the next generation and went off to the Sotheby's or Christie's or wherever.

20:57.317 --> 21:01.302
I don't know if it's an innate thing, if it's an inherited thing.

21:01.362 --> 21:03.524
I think, however, it is innate.

21:03.544 --> 21:04.465
It's within the individual.

21:05.827 --> 21:06.428
What's in a book?

21:07.469 --> 21:13.135
A Gentle Madness, according to Nicholas Besbaines.

21:13.195 --> 21:17.100
I'm sorry, perhaps I'm not... It's a tough name, but it's a Greek origin and...

21:17.401 --> 21:22.264
which has, however, been anglicized to Baz Bain's, but you're doing very well with it.

21:23.510 --> 21:33.024
bibliophiles, bibliomanes, that also rhymes with besbane, come to think of it, the eternal passion for books.

21:33.044 --> 21:35.027
I've never heard it better described.

21:35.568 --> 21:38.853
If you'd like to join us on the air, the number toll-free, 1-800-642-1234.

21:38.873 --> 21:47.206

21:47.627 --> 21:48.548
I'm Jean Faraka.

21:48.969 --> 21:51.913

22:00.536 --> 22:05.646
You'll find a wide array of interesting guests answering thoughtful questions from our hosts and from you.

22:06.047 --> 22:11.438
We bring people and ideas together all week long on the Ideas Network of Wisconsin Public Radio.

22:25.863 --> 22:29.529
Join in next hour with your questions about your pets.

22:29.549 --> 22:34.657
Larry Mueller talks with UW Medicine Veterinarian from 11 till 1230.

22:36.540 --> 22:39.064
We have a caller who joins us from Milwaukee.

22:40.827 --> 22:41.789
Hello.

22:41.869 --> 22:45.315
I'm calling to tell you I am so happy this man is speaking this morning.

22:45.335 --> 22:51.685
I have been in the process of packing up as a way of de-singing my life.

22:52.222 --> 22:55.725
a lot of items, including mostly books, to give to the Salvation Army.

22:55.745 --> 22:58.748
And after hearing this man, I am unpacking the boxes.

22:59.428 --> 23:04.873
It took me such emotional pain to even put these books in the box.

23:05.994 --> 23:12.479
And when I heard him describe the very things that I've always felt about books, I thought to myself, why am I doing this?

23:12.780 --> 23:15.802
Let my kids after me have the burden of getting rid of them.

23:15.962 --> 23:17.464
I am, in my lifetime, in keeping them.

23:18.224 --> 23:21.587
I also wanted to tell you, Jean, that your use of the word erotic

23:22.192 --> 23:23.333
is really not quite it.

23:24.134 --> 23:25.775
Books are orgasmic.

23:25.795 --> 23:28.318
That is the real word.

23:28.338 --> 23:31.381
That is the real word, and I'm so happy you have this gentleman on.

23:32.902 --> 23:35.264
I could live with a man like that the rest of my life.

23:38.608 --> 23:44.974
Well, one of the cute things that happens here periodically, as everyone has to do, we spring clean.

23:45.214 --> 23:46.335
We decide.

23:46.916 --> 23:51.540
Remember I said earlier, if there's a book that I've decided I can't,

23:51.908 --> 23:52.549
or whatever.

23:52.629 --> 23:53.410
And so we cull.

23:53.450 --> 23:55.273
We go through the process of culling.

23:55.793 --> 24:00.179
And as this lady has just said, give to the Salvation Army or one of the libraries.

24:00.840 --> 24:01.561
But it's so funny.

24:01.581 --> 24:06.308
With 15,000 books, I might be able to find six or eight that I'm willing to part with.

24:06.688 --> 24:09.472
And then I will have terrible anxiety attacks.

24:09.552 --> 24:13.918
I mean, I've actually given books away and gone out and bought the same copy again to get it back.

24:14.699 --> 24:15.180
It's terrible.

24:15.200 --> 24:18.304
I mean, you really hate to part with a book that you've enjoyed or

24:18.892 --> 24:22.157
I have had some attachment with, good for you, keep your book.

24:24.661 --> 24:25.162
Wonderful.

24:26.003 --> 24:26.785
Okay, next.

24:26.985 --> 24:31.432
By the way, what does this collection weigh, I wonder?

24:33.575 --> 24:45.895
I do know that when we added a room to the house, which is the library I'm sitting in now, the building inspector did suggest that we had extra room.

24:46.769 --> 25:11.180
I have no idea what it weighs, but if you recall, there's a cute little anecdote in Chapter 1 about this gentleman from Nebraska, Lincoln, who actually came in violation of the law because the load limit of his house was something like 10 times exceeded by 10 times the legal limits, and it was all books, and most of these books.

25:11.240 --> 25:15.105
Now, by the way, to go back to an earlier theme, or at the University of Kansas,

25:15.457 --> 25:24.509
That's the Fitzpatrick collection, considered by many to be junk, but today considered one of the great, great collections of science at the University of Kansas.

25:26.172 --> 25:28.334
Next, we go to a caller from La Crosse.

25:29.516 --> 25:29.796
Hello.

25:30.177 --> 25:30.337
Hi.

25:31.359 --> 25:33.822
I just have a couple questions.

25:34.663 --> 25:41.713
First off, I picked up a book at a rummage sale not too long ago here entitled Swinton's Fifth Reader.

25:42.714 --> 25:42.814
Yeah.

25:43.233 --> 25:46.817
I bought it for my son because it contained some good literature.

25:46.857 --> 25:51.261
And when I got it home, I realized that the copyright date was 1853.

25:51.402 --> 25:53.804
Interesting.

25:53.824 --> 25:59.330
And I was wondering where I can find out if there's any value attached to this book.

26:01.092 --> 26:05.777
I would look in, first of all, is it a textbook, like a school textbook?

26:05.797 --> 26:10.101
It looks like a school reader, like something they may have used in a grade school.

26:10.655 --> 26:21.768
My sense initially, and again, I'm not a book dealer by any means, but generally speaking, old text, in terms of value, don't have much value.

26:22.028 --> 26:26.113
You don't know whether or not it's a first printing or an eleventh printing or whatever.

26:26.453 --> 26:27.475
You don't know that, do you?

26:27.495 --> 26:28.155
What does it say?

26:28.796 --> 26:32.621
But they were printed in the thousands, of course.

26:33.322 --> 26:36.325
So even though it's an old book, it's not necessarily a scarce book.

26:36.760 --> 26:44.146
Well, what I would do is check the Bibliography of American Literature to see if it's in there.

26:44.426 --> 26:46.288
No, we're having trouble hearing you.

26:46.328 --> 26:48.530
I wonder if I could ask you to speak up just a little bit.

26:48.670 --> 26:49.671
That's much better.

26:50.451 --> 26:50.852
I'm sorry.

26:52.073 --> 26:55.956
I think there would be a number of bibliographical sources that you could check.

26:56.176 --> 27:01.921
I would try BAL, the Bibliography of American Literature, see if it's in there under the author.

27:04.583 --> 27:06.565
But my initial sense is that

27:06.747 --> 27:11.252
where it's probably a textbook, that it probably does not have that much value.

27:11.272 --> 27:13.074
But I certainly would not want to be held to that.

27:13.735 --> 27:14.295
Okay.

27:14.315 --> 27:15.056
Next, Middleton.

27:17.238 --> 27:17.439
Go ahead.

27:18.299 --> 27:19.120
Is it Middleton?

27:19.140 --> 27:19.581
Yes, it is.

27:19.601 --> 27:20.902
Hello.

27:20.922 --> 27:23.445
I'm so glad that you have this guest and this show on.

27:23.625 --> 27:29.412
I feel like I've been carrying the secret shame.

27:29.432 --> 27:33.696
I'm the only one in my whole entire family who has a curse.

27:33.756 --> 27:35.438
I've been working in publishing...

27:35.772 --> 27:37.093
for the past ten years.

27:37.233 --> 27:39.155
I love to make books.

27:39.616 --> 27:49.086
But I wanted to tell you, I happen to think that it's something one's born with, and I think it's also related to a love of reading.

27:50.207 --> 28:05.222
But for me, collecting books, I've thought about this a lot because I've moved so many times, and it's just I'm in the process of moving again, and it's an expensive venture to move books, and I do my moving myself.

28:05.692 --> 28:11.759
I grew up in a little tiny village in western Wisconsin in the 60s, and we didn't have a library.

28:11.799 --> 28:25.275
And the closest town that had a library to my town was 17 miles away, and the only way I could get books was by babysitting, which I started doing in fifth grade for 25 cents an hour.

28:26.036 --> 28:29.861
And I read Little Women when I was about, I think, about 9 or 10.

28:29.881 --> 28:34.146
I was so inspired by the book because Beth's neighbor...

28:34.615 --> 28:43.605
I don't remember his name, but in the story, the neighbor had a library, and she would go there and get lost in the books.

28:43.665 --> 28:47.409
And I resolved at that age that when I grew up, I was going to have a library.

28:48.210 --> 28:48.770
And I do.

28:48.810 --> 28:55.297
And I derive the same sort of comfort from it that you described, the same sort of pleasure.

28:55.598 --> 29:02.385
You know, if I see a book that's thrown out in a recycling bin, I find it kind of painful.

29:03.286 --> 29:04.167
And...

29:04.400 --> 29:12.569
I guess I just want to close it off by saying that I really, really have a deep, deep reverence for books.

29:12.589 --> 29:15.191
And I know that there are a lot of others out there.

29:15.251 --> 29:25.322
And just, you know, it's an inexplicable kind of compulsion to love and collect books.

29:25.342 --> 29:32.389
And it's really great to hear that there are more people out there and to hear the stories that people are saying, their anecdotes.

29:32.469 --> 29:33.090
So thanks.

29:33.577 --> 29:36.260
Thank you very much for that wonderful call.

29:36.581 --> 29:40.405
It's interesting that my 11-year-old daughter just finished reading.

29:40.425 --> 29:50.097
It took her about a month or six weeks, but she just finished reading Little Women, and she would not allow herself to watch the video of that wonderful movie until she'd finished it.

29:50.137 --> 29:53.301
She said, Dad, 476 pages.

29:53.361 --> 29:55.203
She said, It's the longest book I've ever read.

29:55.243 --> 30:00.449
I said, Honey, I think that's a bigger book than many people, adults, have read.

30:00.630 --> 30:02.672
I'm very proud of her, but...

30:03.040 --> 30:09.689
Moving books, I think, has to be the most difficult, the most formidable thing that anybody could be faced with.

30:10.209 --> 30:11.972
Gene, you mentioned earlier the weight of the books.

30:12.412 --> 30:13.614
I mean, it's awesome.

30:13.654 --> 30:22.626
I think when you think of how many boxes it might take to fill a library of 5,000 books or even 1,500 books.

30:23.547 --> 30:29.655
Stephen Blumberg, the book thief, when they seized his books, 23,000, it was something like 879 books.

30:30.125 --> 30:43.915
packing crates seventeen FBI agents it took them two days to remove these books from that house but this woman has just described moving often with a lot of books it's not an easy thing to do is that part of what
