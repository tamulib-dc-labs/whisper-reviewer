00:14.521 --> 00:24.496
I've met a number of very interesting dealers this morning from the west coast, from New York, from Philadelphia.

00:24.596 --> 00:31.827
A gentleman who brought the Lefkart O'Hearn items for Japanese collector.

00:32.549 --> 00:36.322
He gave me his card, suggested that I see him when I go out to California.

00:37.085 --> 00:38.851

06:02.111 --> 06:02.391

06:06.742 --> 06:14.656
Now I know that she's got $2,288, perhaps one of the gold is a listed one.

06:14.817 --> 06:18.343
It's over now, $85, $50, it's $75, $200 now.

06:18.363 --> 06:19.826
It's over here, it's up to $1,200.

06:33.978 --> 06:38.132
Last time I was in Dallas where the night of the week was around there,

07:10.411 --> 07:20.043
Well, you see that in the children of the children of the world.

07:20.063 --> 07:34.680
That 5,000 belongs to this, 5,000 of the Lord, 85,000, and 5,000 belongs to this, 5,500, and 6,500, and 6,500, and 6,500 of the Lord, and 6,500, and 6,500 of the Lord, and 6,500 of the Lord, and 6,500.

07:34.660 --> 07:41.808
Eight thousand dollars, eight thousand dollars, I mean eight thousand.

07:42.208 --> 07:46.873
For my wife, eight thousand dollars, then he is not too busy, eight thousand dollars.

07:47.073 --> 07:54.541
Then eight thousand dollars, then he also, eight thousand dollars, in small life, then eight thousand dollars, the purpose of eight thousand dollars.

07:54.561 --> 07:59.566
Eight thousand dollars, that's true in the year, and that's the best, what kind of money?

07:59.586 --> 08:00.347

That $17,000 now is $17,000.

11:42.987 --> 11:46.131
That $17,000 now is $17,000.

11:46.151 --> 11:46.511
This is important.

11:47.713 --> 11:55.062
The last time I was going to speak with Christians,

11:55.396 --> 12:16.543
And I bought it on the roof and bought it on the roof and bought it on the roof and bought it on the roof and bought it on the roof and bought it on the roof and bought it on the roof and bought it on the roof and bought it on the roof and bought it on the roof and bought it on the roof and bought it on the roof and bought it on the roof and bought it on the roof and bought it on the roof and bought it on the roof and bought it on the roof and bought it on the roof and bought it on the roof and bought it on the roof and bought it on the roof and bought it on the roof and bought it on the roof and bought it on the roof and bought it on the roof and bought it on the roof and bought it on the roof and bought it on the roof and bought it on the roof and bought it on the roof and bought it on the roof and bought it on the roof and bought it on the roof and bought it on the roof and bought it on the roof and bought it on the roof and bought it on the roof and

12:17.637 --> 12:27.232
This is through the looking glass 2349, opens at the $20,000.

12:29.656 --> 12:43.678
And Mickey Mouse astoundingly went from $4,500 to an FCD bid estimate only to bring $600.

12:43.658 --> 12:55.131
and 7,500, and 7,500, all my life, and 7,500.

12:55.151 --> 12:56.415
What is it?

12:56.475 --> 12:58.140
7,500.

13:11.080 --> 13:17.072
Vahat is being Vahat.

13:17.533 --> 13:18.836
Vahat was a little bit.

13:18.856 --> 13:21.361
Vahat was a little bit.

13:21.401 --> 13:22.884
Vahat was a little bit.

13:23.285 --> 13:23.846
Vahat was a little bit.

13:23.866 --> 13:24.327
Vahat was a little bit.

13:24.347 --> 13:26.892
Vahat was a little bit.

13:26.912 --> 13:27.874
Vahat was a little bit.

13:27.854 --> 13:54.418
13, 14, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15,

13:57.638 --> 14:15.985
This is when you're in the willows.

14:16.686 --> 14:24.878
That's interesting.

14:24.858 --> 14:29.386
$15,000, $17,000, $18,000, $19,000, $20,000.

14:29.406 --> 14:30.588

14:30.608 --> 14:31.890
That's $20,000.

14:31.910 --> 14:32.852
That's $20,000.

14:32.872 --> 14:33.713
That's $20,000.

14:33.733 --> 14:35.196
That's $20,000.

14:35.216 --> 14:36.919
That's $20,000.

14:37.039 --> 14:38.201
That's $20,000.

14:38.281 --> 14:38.802
That's $20,000.

14:38.822 --> 14:39.623
That's $20,000.

14:39.643 --> 14:40.545
That's $20,000.

14:40.605 --> 14:41.126
$20,000.

14:41.146 --> 14:41.647

14:43.209 --> 14:43.370
$20,000.

14:43.390 --> 14:43.550
$20,000.

14:43.570 --> 14:43.730
$20,000.

14:43.750 --> 14:43.911
$20,000.

14:43.931 --> 14:44.091
$20,000.

$20,000.

14:44.291 --> 14:44.472
$20,000.

14:44.492 --> 14:44.692
$20,000.

14:44.712 --> 14:44.892
$20,000.

14:44.912 --> 14:45.073
$20,000.

14:45.093 --> 14:45.253
$20,000.

14:45.273 --> 14:45.433
$20,000.

14:45.453 --> 14:45.614
$20,000.

14:45.634 --> 14:45.794
$20,000.

14:45.814 --> 14:45.974
$20,000.

14:45.994 --> 14:46.154
$20,000.

14:46.174 --> 14:46.335
$20,000.

14:46.355 --> 14:46.495
$20,000

14:55.705 --> 15:23.653
I don't have a little lady before I hear, but when do you know what I want to say?

15:27.160 --> 15:31.385
You have number 23,55.

15:31.405 --> 15:31.885
I have heard about this.

15:32.045 --> 15:49.405
It's twenty-five, seventy-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty-five, twenty

15:49.739 --> 16:09.081
So within three items we go from $20,000.

16:10.006 --> 16:14.452
And there's the willows right down to 125, which gives me information.

16:14.472 --> 16:17.135
But it's not totally inscribed that big.

16:17.495 --> 16:18.276
$5,000.

16:18.296 --> 16:19.678
$5,000.

16:19.698 --> 16:20.899
$5,000.

16:20.920 --> 16:39.102
$5,000.

16:41.950 --> 16:47.680
In my mind.

16:48.060 --> 16:58.819
Mark number 2368.

16:59.460 --> 17:04.448
So it's over.

17:10.030 --> 17:33.490
But if we could be wrong, fast and not slow, if we could not understand the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of

17:33.757 --> 17:35.519
$3,500 for my wife.

17:55.788 --> 17:56.169
$4,000 for my wife.

17:56.189 --> 17:56.569
$4,000 for my wife.

17:56.589 --> 17:56.970
$4,000 for my wife.

17:56.990 --> 17:57.370

18:02.337 --> 18:02.818
$4,000 for my wife.

18:03.777 --> 18:17.585
Actually, it reads as in the description of Mark 3 to 2.

18:17.865 --> 18:20.450
Oh, that's right.

18:20.470 --> 18:20.671
Yes.

18:20.691 --> 18:21.272
I have an exhibition.

18:21.292 --> 18:23.777
This is the blind copy of Luke 4.

18:24.905 --> 18:28.532
of Uncle Remus, after the full-time description.

18:28.552 --> 18:32.559
The description of Catholic is a duplicate of law 2382.

18:32.579 --> 18:41.696
So this is the Uncle Remus in the fine position of Blue Cross.

18:41.716 --> 18:45.343
And I have eight episodes of military episodes of 1,800, 1,900, 1,000, 1,000.

18:49.694 --> 18:53.199
18, 19, 3,000, which is 50, 500, which is 50, 3,000.

19:21.841 --> 19:37.156
I'm sorry, I wasn't going to go wrong.

19:37.576 --> 19:48.186
Three thousand dollars per one.

19:52.267 --> 20:21.649
Last $2.380 longer, I have $4.340, $4.340, $4.340, $4.340, $4.550, $600, $650, $700, $750, $800, $850, $900, $950, $1000, $1100, $1200, $1200, $1200, $1300, $1300, $1300, $1300, $1300, $1300, $1300, $1300, $1300, $1300, $1300.

20:30.708 --> 20:50.235
Last experience is that period of resistance, 300, 300, 350, 400, 40, 500, 550, 600, 250, 700, 650, 800, 850, last word, 850, that's 850, that's 850, that's 850, that's 850.

20:52.409 --> 20:56.095
Not every person is really free.

20:56.115 --> 21:02.244
And I have 40 dollars on this, 40 dollars for 50, 500, 500 dollars, 50, 300, 50, 700, 750 on my life.

21:02.805 --> 21:03.466
That's 750.

21:03.606 --> 21:11.018
And if not for the 750, 750 is over 800, 850, 900, 950, 950 dollar life.

21:11.939 --> 21:14.703
Forty hours.

21:14.723 --> 21:17.868
Oh, sorry, forty hours.

21:19.591 --> 21:21.133
Do you know what that's 49 verses?

21:23.290 --> 21:37.192
Yes, we're holding the meditation.

21:39.195 --> 21:42.801
Shri Mataji.

21:43.943 --> 21:48.530
Shri Mataji.

21:48.550 --> 21:49.872
Shri Mataji.

21:51.961 --> 21:57.612
Not that you're not supposed to be like this, please.

21:57.632 --> 22:09.615
And I was talking about the list, it was not supposed to be like this, it was not supposed to be like this, it was supposed to be like this, it was supposed to be like this, it was supposed to be like this, it was supposed to be like this

22:15.839 --> 22:43.197
This is Lodge 2423 with big projections.

22:43.632 --> 23:09.336
75,000, 75,000, 75,000, 75,000, 75,000, 75,000, 75,000, 75,000, 75,000, 75,000, 75,000, 75,000, 75,000, 75,000, 75,000, 75,000, 75,000, 75,000, 75,000, 75,000, 75,000,

23:10.109 --> 23:14.238
It is different.

23:15.240 --> 23:16.924
It is different.

23:16.944 --> 23:17.806
It is different.

23:17.826 --> 23:18.146
It is different.

23:18.166 --> 23:18.487
It is different.

23:18.808 --> 23:19.489
It is different.

23:21.073 --> 23:26.424
It is different.

23:26.444 --> 23:26.785
It is different.

23:26.945 --> 23:27.266
It is different.

23:27.286 --> 23:27.607
It is different.

23:27.627 --> 23:28.809
It is different.

23:28.829 --> 23:29.150
It is different.

23:29.170 --> 23:29.631
It is different.

23:29.771 --> 23:30.092
It is different.

23:31.709 --> 24:01.176
This is 2424 and it's much longer than the other.

24:02.641 --> 24:14.193
There is one back there according to the government of the government.

24:16.176 --> 24:18.178
You know, one is the government.

24:18.278 --> 24:30.471
The last one they said, the fourth is five, and eight of them are for this, eight of them are $1,000, $1,000, $1,000, $1,000, $1,000, $1,000, $1,000, $1,000, $1,000, $1,000, $1,000, $1,000, $1,000, $1,000, $1,000, $1,000, $1,000.

30, 40, 30, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60,

24:53.452 --> 25:14.194
And I just have to go with it, I just have to go with it, I just have to go with it, I just have to go with it, I just have to go with it, I just have to go with it, I just have to go with it, I just have to go with it, I just have to go with it, I just have to go with it, I just have to go with it, I just have to go with it, I just have to go with it, I just have to go with it, I just have to go with it, I just have to go with it.

25:20.519 --> 25:29.710
And now I'm going to go to the world.

25:29.730 --> 25:31.913
I am going to go to the world.

25:31.933 --> 25:34.817
I am going to go to the world.

25:34.837 --> 25:36.058
I am going to go to the world.

$3,500.

27:53.383 --> 27:53.443
$3,

27:56.242 --> 28:01.628
This is part one of Heidi 2469.

28:07.025 --> 28:31.193
775.

28:35.543 --> 28:43.791
You have 30 years, so 30.

28:44.011 --> 28:49.196
I think I should say, the first day is 30 years later.

28:49.216 --> 28:55.542
That day, of course, the days of 3,500, I feel it is less than 3,000 people.

28:55.562 --> 29:05.432
400, 50, 500, 50, 6,000, 50, 7,000, 50, 8,000, 50, 9,000, 50, 100,

29:35.247 --> 29:59.415
... ... ... ...

30:01.471 --> 30:04.527
What is this?

30:05.412 --> 30:06.316
This is?

30:06.336 --> 30:07.141
What is this?

30:07.161 --> 30:07.342
Eighteen.

30:08.267 --> 30:08.789
Eighteen is not happy now.

30:08.809 --> 30:09.332
Eighteen is not happy now.

30:09.352 --> 30:09.895
Eighteen is happy now.

30:12.693 --> 30:20.420
Last time I was 24, 73 years ago, I left again.

30:20.440 --> 30:41.080
That's about 15, I don't know if this is 15, I don't know if it's 15, I don't know if it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's 15, it's

30:41.785 --> 30:53.660
And five fifty-five million dollars, the idea is fifty-five million dollars, they're working.

30:53.680 --> 30:54.601
Fifty-five million dollars, one hundred.

30:56.484 --> 30:57.305
Last of all, it's more.

30:57.325 --> 31:03.152
One thousand dollars, one thousand dollars, one thousand dollars, one thousand, one thousand, one thousand, one thousand, one thousand, one thousand, one thousand, one thousand, one thousand, one thousand.

31:05.343 --> 31:35.333

Cloud number 2487.

31:46.865 --> 31:50.115
And very, very spirited.

31:51.243 --> 32:11.412
That's wonderful.

32:11.392 --> 32:19.323
This is why I wasn't, that is why I didn't have a challenge, this is why I was like six thousand.

32:19.343 --> 32:22.708
I had six thousand dollars, I didn't even think about it at all.

32:22.728 --> 32:26.834
You see, I did thousands of dollars, that is often six thousand dollars, very well.

32:29.558 --> 32:31.020
It's not on the same thing.

32:37.396 --> 32:59.860
Law 1.24 is 8, and so this is going over 200 and it comes to 200, it comes to 10, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15
