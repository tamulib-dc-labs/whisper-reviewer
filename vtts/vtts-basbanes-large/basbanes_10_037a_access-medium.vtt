00:02.967 --> 00:04.269
Joe Jacobson, right?

00:04.570 --> 00:05.291
Joe Joseph?

00:05.411 --> 00:08.377
Well, what's your actual... Yeah, Joe's name is Jacobson.

00:08.397 --> 00:10.380
Joseph, and your usable initial?

00:11.082 --> 00:12.404
And... And you're young.

00:13.767 --> 00:14.468
Why do you say that?

00:16.492 --> 00:18.816
Well, because I'm... Thirty-one.

00:18.996 --> 00:19.617
Thirty-one.

00:19.637 --> 00:21.401
Is that young?

00:21.421 --> 00:21.821
That's young.

00:23.284 --> 00:26.089
My background is... I was out of college with your report, so...

00:26.491 --> 00:30.015
My background's in physics, so as a physicist, that's all.

00:30.035 --> 00:36.223
Well, and I know it because you are working in an area that has kind of anticipated dramatic changes.

00:37.765 --> 00:50.841
Anyways, there's a great story in Cuneiform about, you probably know this, but in Alexandria, they would solicit texts from around the world, and with the promise that they would copy them.

00:50.861 --> 00:52.363
It's in Chapter 2 of my book.

00:52.681 --> 00:53.021
Is it?

00:53.362 --> 00:53.702
Yeah.

00:53.722 --> 00:55.364
And they keep it caught in the originals.

00:55.404 --> 00:56.184
Keep the originals back.

00:56.204 --> 00:58.827
You know what the original source for that story is?

00:58.847 --> 00:59.127
Tom.

00:59.367 --> 00:59.788
Galen.

01:00.989 --> 01:01.429
Galen.

01:01.850 --> 01:02.090
Galen.

01:02.450 --> 01:08.556
Now, one of the things I wanted to do in The Gentle Madness is not only tell the great stories, but... And this is in Gentle Madness.

01:08.576 --> 01:09.617
This is in my book.

01:09.677 --> 01:10.238
I've got to read it.

01:10.278 --> 01:11.539
The Gentle Madness.

01:13.981 --> 01:15.122
It's just in bookstores now.

01:15.282 --> 01:16.103
Everywhere, yeah.

01:16.123 --> 01:17.324
It's been out since 1995.

01:17.344 --> 01:20.928
It was a finalist last year for the National Book Predicts Circle.

01:22.149 --> 01:22.249
Okay.

01:22.685 --> 01:26.909
And this new book is basically a companion volume to that.

01:26.929 --> 01:31.393
It's got a gorgeous knockout dust jacket with the door ingredient of the book pool.

01:31.634 --> 01:32.715
You've probably seen it.

01:32.775 --> 01:36.318
I mean, it's really... The Globe did a huge story on it last year.

01:36.338 --> 01:37.860
I don't read The Globe, unfortunately.

01:37.880 --> 01:38.240
I read The Times.

01:38.260 --> 01:38.680
I read The Times.

01:38.700 --> 01:39.081
I read The Times.

01:39.101 --> 01:39.441
I read The Times.

01:39.461 --> 01:39.802
I read The Times.

01:39.822 --> 01:40.222
I read The Times.

01:40.282 --> 01:40.662
I read The Times.

01:40.682 --> 01:41.083
I read The Times.

01:41.103 --> 01:41.463
I read The Times.

01:41.483 --> 01:41.843
I read The Times.

01:41.864 --> 01:42.244
I read The Times.

01:42.264 --> 01:42.604
I read The Times.

01:42.624 --> 01:42.965
I read The Times.

01:42.985 --> 01:43.325
I read The Times.

01:43.345 --> 01:43.765
I read The Times.

01:43.785 --> 01:44.186
I read The Times.

01:44.206 --> 01:44.606
I read The Times.

01:44.626 --> 01:45.027
I read The Times.

01:45.047 --> 01:45.407
I read The Times.

01:45.427 --> 01:45.967
I read The Times.

01:45.987 --> 01:46.348
I read The Times.

01:46.368 --> 01:46.728
I read The Times.

01:46.748 --> 01:47.089
I read The Times.

01:47.109 --> 01:47.489
I read The Times.

01:47.509 --> 01:47.849
I read The Times.

01:47.869 --> 01:48.910
I read The Times.

01:48.930 --> 01:49.311
I read The Times.

01:49.331 --> 01:49.791
I read The Times.

01:49.811 --> 01:50.572
I read The Times.

01:50.592 --> 01:50.932
I read The Times.

01:50.952 --> 01:51.293
I read The Times.

01:51.313 --> 01:51.673
I read The Times.

01:51.693 --> 01:51.713
I

01:52.216 --> 02:03.232
Just a bit before Gutenberg, I guess in 1313, was Wayne Chen, who actually had the whole system that Gutenberg had.

02:03.252 --> 02:10.682
It wasn't metal type, it was ceramic type, but it was movable, and he had a press and so forth.

02:10.702 --> 02:18.273
But the interesting thing is the book that he published was, in 1313, was the history of technology, which I thought was great.

02:18.614 --> 02:20.016
How do you spell this guy's name?

02:20.036 --> 02:20.897
Wayne Chen.

02:21.238 --> 02:21.598
Wayne?

02:21.950 --> 02:25.414
I believe it's W-E-N-G-Chen.

02:26.555 --> 02:28.597
And the translation is The History of Technology?

02:28.617 --> 02:31.520
The History of Technology.

02:31.560 --> 02:33.382
That's the kind of detail I love.

02:33.882 --> 02:39.068
And I do have a book, The History of the Discovery of Printing in China, on the Columbia University Press.

02:39.088 --> 02:40.409
It must be in there, right?

02:40.749 --> 02:42.631
I would assume it would be in there.

02:42.651 --> 02:43.652
The History of Technology.

02:43.672 --> 02:48.177
The problem with the Chinese printing, of course, is the characters, and how many...

02:48.325 --> 02:48.866
Right.

02:48.886 --> 02:57.459
Well, that's why people said that Gutenberg went to metal, or that the Europeans embedded metal in the first place, is that a Roman character is much smaller than a Chinese character.

02:57.479 --> 03:03.868
You need more detail, and you can't really support that in a San Seren, in Nigeria.

03:05.411 --> 03:08.515
That's one reason that's citing it.

03:08.595 --> 03:16.307
It's amazing when you look at Gutenberg's type that the mixture of tin, antimonium, lead that he used,

03:17.148 --> 03:18.931
Has any of his type survived?

03:18.951 --> 03:19.872
Yeah, yeah.

03:19.892 --> 03:20.293
Is that right?

03:20.373 --> 03:23.838
Yeah, people have recently done spectroscopy on his type.

03:24.039 --> 03:26.082
I didn't know the type survived.

03:26.102 --> 03:35.977
Yeah, the metal orgy is almost identical to what is used up until a few years ago, which is amazing.

03:36.538 --> 03:38.922
Did he also have to invent an ink?

03:39.042 --> 03:42.067
Yeah, he invented ink.

03:42.087 --> 03:45.552
He invented ink, metal matrix in the press,

03:49.784 --> 04:02.803
Right, but the ink, you needed an ink that had good sticking problems, but really the Chinese already 2,500 years before that had reasonable.

04:02.823 --> 04:03.885
How many years?

04:03.905 --> 04:07.270
2,500 years before that had developed the process.

04:07.330 --> 04:10.174
Had reasonable inks, right?

04:10.434 --> 04:11.156
Reasonable what?

04:11.336 --> 04:11.877
Inks.

04:11.897 --> 04:15.202
Inks.

04:15.222 --> 04:18.947
And anyway, let me tell you a bit about what we're up to.

04:19.602 --> 04:29.613
I actually have a question for you that I'll ask and everybody asks me, and the question is, why a book?

04:29.994 --> 04:34.559
Why don't you tell me what you're opening up here?

04:34.579 --> 04:43.428
Oh, this is just a notebook, but I'm going to just show you a few film clips of stuff that we're doing down there.

04:43.449 --> 04:45.711
What we're developing is something called

04:46.045 --> 04:50.472
and it's described in some of those articles, is called electronic ink.

04:50.492 --> 04:51.633
Electronic ink.

04:51.653 --> 04:53.616
Electronic ink, right.

04:53.676 --> 05:00.927
What it is, is a real printable ink, like a silkscreenable ink.

05:00.947 --> 05:08.439
We can silkscreen it onto an arbitrary surface, but now this ink has something special inside of it.

05:08.479 --> 05:10.642
We can address it in an electric field.

05:11.403 --> 05:12.745
So, the idea is to

05:12.910 --> 05:18.556
start with a piece of paper, print a couple of layers of ink that we've developed.

05:18.576 --> 05:23.881
And then, instead of printing letters, we're going to actually print an electronic display.

05:25.243 --> 05:30.768
The reason we thought about this project was because of thinking about a book.

05:32.230 --> 05:35.033
And there are many other uses for this ink.

05:35.253 --> 05:39.998
We've got a whole range of projects that we're working on with this material.

05:40.670 --> 05:48.338
from shoes that display how far you run, to watch bands that display your email, to clothing that changes.

05:49.439 --> 05:54.064
But the motivation was, in fact, in a book.

05:54.244 --> 06:00.671
And the reason is that... The primary motivation was in producing a book.

06:00.711 --> 06:01.312
Well, right.

06:01.352 --> 06:10.221
The original motivation came from thinking about how do you make an electronic book that looks and feels like a real hardcover book

06:10.825 --> 06:14.931
It's got several hundred real paper pages in it.

06:14.951 --> 06:22.962
But nonetheless, we want to make each page an electronic display.

06:23.743 --> 06:33.477
And that's a very tough problem because most displays, even this flat display, are not flexible.

06:33.657 --> 06:35.179
You're talking about the flat display on the screen.

06:35.463 --> 06:39.028
Well, let's say this display, for instance.

06:39.168 --> 06:43.093
This display here costs about $1,000, OEM cost.

06:44.135 --> 06:50.082
It's a nice display, but the price is much too high if you want several hundred of these.

06:50.483 --> 06:52.426
Also, it's too thick to make a book.

06:53.227 --> 07:00.777
What we need is something we can actually put on paper, and so that's why we invented this ink system.

07:00.797 --> 07:01.538
Ink system?

07:01.858 --> 07:03.580
Yes, this electronic ink system.

07:03.700 --> 07:04.862
Let me give you an idea here.

07:06.580 --> 07:36.520
just open this up what we're talking about here let's see my apologies by the way this morning i the time that i had down when we chatted on the phone was 9 30 and i never looked at uh

07:37.782 --> 07:45.108
I was here until about 4 last night trying to get him a couple of things out.

07:45.129 --> 07:49.512
Okay, so this is... Tell me what you're displaying now, if you like.

07:49.532 --> 07:52.695
Okay, I'm going to open this up in March.

07:52.895 --> 07:54.477
I see eight pages.

07:55.117 --> 07:59.862
You're going to see one in a second.

07:59.882 --> 08:00.002
Okay.

08:00.242 --> 08:02.944
So this is the idea for a book.

08:03.425 --> 08:04.305
We call it the e-book.

08:05.787 --> 08:07.148
Yeah, you can call it...

08:07.330 --> 08:33.135
electronic book it's fine and again the idea was we wanted to think of a way to make such a real hardcover book that had several hundred real paper pages in it on the spine you could leaf through a few thousand titles find one you like press a button wait 30 seconds open this how are you going to leaf through it with your fingers or with a machine

08:33.588 --> 08:39.015
Okay, on the spine would be a couple of buttons here that you could leaf through and different titles would come up.

08:39.035 --> 08:48.066
When you find one you like, let's say King Lear, you press a button, wait 30 seconds, open it, and now you're reading King Lear on real paper page.

08:48.086 --> 08:49.467
It's all loaded into this book?

08:50.208 --> 08:52.211
Loaded into this book, right.

08:52.771 --> 08:56.496
So it already has a menu of X number of titles loaded into it.

08:56.696 --> 08:57.317
That's right.

08:57.517 --> 08:58.498
That's right.

08:58.518 --> 09:00.781
Contained in microchips or some such.

09:00.801 --> 09:01.001
All right.

09:01.121 --> 09:11.594
It contained either in a flash memory or a magneto-resistant drive, for instance, that have very high storage capacity.

09:11.614 --> 09:13.717
So the technology is already there?

09:13.917 --> 09:15.218
For the storage, it's there.

09:15.319 --> 09:21.786
But the question is, how do you put new text onto paper itself?

09:21.826 --> 09:25.110
When we print paper, it's static.

09:25.130 --> 09:27.253
It's not changing.

09:27.571 --> 09:30.274
What we developed is this ink material.

09:30.314 --> 09:36.100
Everything I'm going to tell you is all done in-house.

09:36.160 --> 09:40.044
We don't take things from outside.

09:40.064 --> 09:44.189
This is an idea of what this ink looks like.

09:44.289 --> 09:50.095
These are little micro particles that are about the size of a grain of laser toner.

09:51.436 --> 09:52.658
This is under the microscope.

09:52.838 --> 09:56.802
Inside is a system that we can affect with an electric field.

09:57.338 --> 10:00.703
This gives an idea of, these are some photomicrographs.

10:00.743 --> 10:01.865
These are ink.

10:02.686 --> 10:04.308
This is the same ink here.

10:05.550 --> 10:09.356
And what we've done here is just a... You're pointing at the blue ink on the left.

10:09.376 --> 10:10.818
The blue ink and the white ink.

10:10.978 --> 10:13.802
This is the picture of the exact same patch of ink.

10:14.103 --> 10:14.964
Okay.

10:14.984 --> 10:22.435
But what we've done is, in this case, we've put an electric field of one type here, and here we've put an electric field of another type.

10:22.904 --> 10:25.808
So the ink itself, once it's printed, is mutable.

10:26.128 --> 10:29.452
We can change its color just by putting an electric field.

10:29.512 --> 10:35.620
Well, printed, you're using, in a futuristic sense, print being something that's permanent, right?

10:36.201 --> 10:39.705
Well, no, this is ink.

10:40.166 --> 10:43.210
These are ink particles, and here, this is an idea of what we can do.

10:43.250 --> 10:47.595
This is a display that we've...

10:48.284 --> 10:51.048
screened or stencil printed onto a piece of paper.

10:51.629 --> 10:56.555
We can actually flip this on and off in an electric field.

10:56.575 --> 10:59.259
Let me show you what this is.

11:05.868 --> 11:07.731
This gives an idea of what this looks like.

11:07.771 --> 11:11.175
This is our ink that we're in an electric field.

11:11.195 --> 11:13.178
So we're switching our ink on and off.

11:14.508 --> 11:23.079
And so you can imagine a page that goes from all white to blue, to white to blue, or we can have patterns, for instance.

11:23.099 --> 11:25.862
And it will be on a piece of paper, or purportedly a piece of paper?

11:25.882 --> 11:26.563
This is on a piece of paper.

11:26.583 --> 11:28.245
You will have the feel of a piece of paper.

11:28.305 --> 11:32.691
Well, this one I showed you was on a real piece of paper.

11:32.711 --> 11:36.696
This is a paper that just went out about a week ago.

11:36.716 --> 11:37.417
This paper here?

11:38.358 --> 11:39.599
This is a scientific paper.

11:39.619 --> 11:41.121
This is from a scientific paper.

11:41.241 --> 11:43.384
Is this something I can access and read someplace?

11:43.820 --> 11:46.242
Yes.

11:50.827 --> 11:54.210
My book is two years away, I understand, so don't worry about it.

11:54.230 --> 11:54.350
Okay.

11:55.671 --> 11:57.733
I can send this to you soon.

11:57.753 --> 11:58.294
If you would.

11:58.314 --> 11:59.015
Would you?

11:59.135 --> 12:01.197
I mean, you have to trust me.

12:01.317 --> 12:02.097
I understand.

12:03.679 --> 12:06.942
We're under the firm of lots of different companies.

12:09.645 --> 12:10.746
I'll get this to you soon.

12:10.766 --> 12:10.986
Okay.

12:11.086 --> 12:13.168
Do you have a card, by the way?

12:13.655 --> 12:28.629
Okay, so in a large way we're really in the chemistry business.

12:28.649 --> 12:36.015
We're in the ink business of making these very special inks that can do strange things like this.

12:37.857 --> 12:41.080
Here's just an idea of

12:41.380 --> 12:50.471
Now, we set out to do an ink that can change only very slowly, and we quickly discovered that we can make our ink change quickly at about 20 hertz.

12:50.972 --> 13:03.928
We actually, as described in that book, in that little paper I gave you on the last book, we actually can make things move fast enough that we can think about books where you would open the book and then

13:04.246 --> 13:07.450
things would move on the surface of the book, like characters.

13:07.610 --> 13:08.672
As you're watching it?

13:08.732 --> 13:10.254
As you're watching it, right.

13:10.274 --> 13:11.135
As you're looking at it.

13:11.155 --> 13:12.256
As you're looking at it, right.

13:12.276 --> 13:15.640
This just gives another idea of... What is that we're looking at?

13:15.660 --> 13:32.802
This is a little... It's a little... I'll tell you what, I don't have a card, but what I'll do, I'll send you a copy of my book.

13:33.676 --> 13:34.577
That would be tremendous.

13:34.597 --> 13:35.518
Straight up, straight up.

13:36.579 --> 13:39.683
Honorable?

13:39.983 --> 13:40.424
You bet.

13:41.265 --> 13:44.509
And that way you don't have to go looking for it, and that will remind you.

13:44.529 --> 13:45.590
Sounds great.

13:45.650 --> 13:48.493
Send me a paper, you know, when it's clear and fine.

13:49.334 --> 13:50.596
I will certainly get it out here.

13:51.256 --> 13:51.477
Okay, good.

13:51.497 --> 13:51.677
Okay.

13:51.697 --> 13:52.898
I'll get the book out this afternoon.

13:52.978 --> 13:53.099
Okay.

13:53.119 --> 13:53.599
Send it here.

13:54.240 --> 13:54.921
That would be great.

13:54.941 --> 13:55.602
Here, let me, yeah.

13:56.963 --> 13:58.185
Yeah, great.

13:58.205 --> 13:58.485
Super.

14:00.247 --> 14:01.168
Make a specific book.

14:04.422 --> 14:04.742
Right.

14:06.384 --> 14:07.846
Multi-pixel display.

14:08.146 --> 14:08.266
Right.

14:08.286 --> 14:12.211
This just gives an idea of how fast we can change things on the surface.

14:13.993 --> 14:18.879
This is printed on a glass slide, because that's what we're running this experiment on.

14:18.959 --> 14:24.285
But again, we can print this, as we showed in this paper, that we can print it on anything, including real paper.

14:26.548 --> 14:27.389
Let me just show you.

14:27.409 --> 14:32.995
I don't want to go into too much detail of the chemistry, but here's another

14:33.380 --> 14:34.121
thing that we made.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.905
This is using this kind of ink.

14:38.086 --> 14:41.772
And what we've made here is something called the reversible printer.

14:42.713 --> 14:54.008
And the idea is we can print something onto a sheet of paper and then take the same piece of paper, feed it back into a printer, and print something completely new on that same piece of paper.

14:54.028 --> 14:55.510
It's like a negative, is what it is.

14:56.251 --> 14:57.433
A photographic negative?

14:57.653 --> 15:01.178
Well, the text just happens to be inverted here.

15:01.198 --> 15:03.201
But no, the real point is this.

15:03.704 --> 15:04.885
It says MIT on it.

15:05.786 --> 15:07.948
And it's going to go through twice.

15:08.209 --> 15:09.850
The first time is going to blank.

15:09.910 --> 15:10.771
What's it going through?

15:10.791 --> 15:12.593
This is a special printer that we built.

15:13.914 --> 15:20.201
And the criterion is, in this printer, there's no ink in this printer.

15:20.721 --> 15:21.562
There's no toner.

15:21.582 --> 15:22.323
There's no chemical.

15:22.383 --> 15:24.245
Nothing is ever added to this printer.

15:24.846 --> 15:27.488
Nonetheless, we can blank out what's on that page.

15:28.269 --> 15:33.154
And then when we feed this through the printer a second time, we can print something completely new.

15:33.843 --> 15:35.446
on the same piece of paper.

15:41.937 --> 15:43.039
That's a very strange thing.

15:43.059 --> 15:47.086
You could think about taking... Well, pardon me, can I just ask... Please.

15:47.106 --> 15:49.931
...the adjective reversible applies to what?

15:50.592 --> 15:55.000
Applies to the ink that is embedded into this piece of paper already.

15:55.381 --> 15:56.302
Okay.

15:56.322 --> 15:59.007
Reversible meaning the process is reversible.

15:59.307 --> 16:01.109
ink's color is reversible.

16:01.350 --> 16:03.192
Not reversible in terms of what I was saying.

16:03.232 --> 16:05.515
That's how I was interpreting the word reversible.

16:05.535 --> 16:05.815
No, no.

16:06.095 --> 16:07.417
I see what you're saying.

16:07.437 --> 16:08.538
So I was totally screwed up.

16:08.558 --> 16:14.766
So this gives an idea that we can put a completely new image onto the same piece of paper.

16:14.786 --> 16:15.767
It's a reversible process.

16:15.827 --> 16:18.130
It's a reversible process, right.

16:18.310 --> 16:22.075
Now, you could think of a bad way to do this.

16:22.095 --> 16:27.762
You could think about taking this printed text here and soaking it in some chemical and getting this

16:28.012 --> 16:29.875
ink off and then printing something new.

16:30.716 --> 16:33.881
What I'm telling you is that's not what's happening here.

16:34.762 --> 16:41.192
This process involves no consumable material whatsoever.

16:41.212 --> 16:43.876
Nothing is being consumed here.

16:44.858 --> 16:54.913
All the magic is happening by leaving the ink on the surface but mutating the ink from one color to another color reversibly.

16:59.483 --> 17:01.225
So, can I ask you a question?

17:01.345 --> 17:03.468
Please, yeah.

17:03.488 --> 17:04.589
I buy one of these books.

17:04.990 --> 17:05.230
Yeah.

17:05.250 --> 17:05.851
I buy one of these.

17:05.891 --> 17:06.872
What are you going to call them?

17:06.892 --> 17:09.916
Is it a book or is it a shell or is it a machine?

17:09.936 --> 17:10.837
What would you call it?

17:10.897 --> 17:11.097
E-book.

17:11.478 --> 17:12.999
Let's call it an e-book or an electron.

17:13.160 --> 17:14.621
Let's say I buy an e-book.

17:15.202 --> 17:15.302
Yeah.

17:15.322 --> 17:17.325
And I can load it with whatever books I want.

17:17.645 --> 17:17.785
Right.

17:17.945 --> 17:18.186
Right.

17:19.187 --> 17:23.532
The problems of copyright and how the author's going to be paid, that's for somebody else to figure out.

17:23.592 --> 17:26.035
Well, there's an easy system for that.

17:26.055 --> 17:28.258
The basic idea is...

17:28.525 --> 17:43.405
I think Grasbane writes a gentle madness and he sells 50,000 copies, but all of a sudden people can go... Okay, well, first of all, already on the web, as you know, there's something, last time I looked, more than 10,000 full textbooks.

17:43.425 --> 17:48.552
Yeah, probably all the copyrights probably already... There's probably not a copyright problem.

17:48.572 --> 17:51.836
A fraction of them are things like Shakespeare and so forth.

17:52.357 --> 17:55.461
Others, unfortunately, are still under copyright, but...

17:55.913 --> 17:58.798
The system is the following.

18:00.060 --> 18:04.487
The book itself would have a vast number.

18:04.527 --> 18:13.000
In fact, in that last book, I show, I talk about the technology that will allow all books to be stored.

18:13.020 --> 18:16.225
Okay, so then don't say things that are already in the paper.

18:16.245 --> 18:16.846
Yeah.

18:17.507 --> 18:20.031
Because I just didn't use my time more productively.

18:20.051 --> 18:20.392
Yeah, okay.

18:20.412 --> 18:22.495
All right, so I buy an e-book, and...

18:22.660 --> 18:37.674
And so I gathered, and the paper's going to tell me if my book is 638 pages and it's 44 lines of a smaller type, and you buy a novel that might be 220 pages with a larger type, this little computer's going to figure all this out, so it's... Yes.

18:38.615 --> 18:49.465
But if you only have 200 physical pages in this book, how is it going to make my book a 600-page book fit onto the sheets that are available?

18:49.485 --> 18:49.686
Right.

18:49.726 --> 18:52.228
If there are only 200 pages, obviously, then...

18:52.529 --> 18:56.393
When you get to the end of the 200th page, then it has to rewrite that book.

18:56.413 --> 18:58.315
Then you just have to go back to the beginning.

18:58.375 --> 19:04.522
Right, but the basic idea would be to have a book that's got a sufficiently number of pages that can incorporate, say, most books.

19:05.323 --> 19:07.485
Why not fit Paul Stoyd?

19:07.766 --> 19:11.149
Is it going to replicate the type of the printed person?

19:11.169 --> 19:12.110
Yes, yes.

19:12.130 --> 19:12.791
Right.

19:12.811 --> 19:17.216
In fact, if your eyesight is poor, you can press a button and the type will expand.

19:17.236 --> 19:19.899
It's fully reconfigurable.

19:19.919 --> 19:21.861
But it will look like the actual book.

19:22.128 --> 19:23.810
It'll look like the actual book.

19:23.910 --> 19:28.496
And if there's a certain style of type, as you know, you see... Of course, right.

19:28.837 --> 19:35.425
If this book is printed in German, blah, blah, blah, what you see at the back, this machine is going to do that.

19:36.687 --> 19:36.887
Right.

19:37.448 --> 19:51.426
I mean, there's no substitute for... If you've got a typesetter like Aldous Minutius, who's probably the world's best typesetter, came right after Gutenberg,

19:51.997 --> 19:58.085
I don't think he's ever been vested.

19:59.087 --> 20:11.284
I think that's a lot of what the soul and body of a book is.

20:11.364 --> 20:18.554
This technology is aimed at being able to do that.

20:18.594 --> 20:20.617
The question I have for you is this.

20:20.637 --> 20:21.598
I had lunch

20:22.844 --> 20:30.738
a while ago with Thomas Amos, Dr. Thomas Amos at Widener Library's assistant curator.

20:30.758 --> 20:36.027
He was actually the curator for the Gutenberg Bible, among other things.

20:37.329 --> 20:46.384
And the question that arises is this, what's the advantage of a book?

20:46.424 --> 20:48.548
Let's say you had a single sheet of paper

20:49.186 --> 20:51.649
that had this electronic paper.

20:51.769 --> 20:58.417
And you have two buttons here that you could leaf through all the different pages of the book.

20:58.517 --> 21:01.480
What's the advantage of a real book?

21:01.500 --> 21:06.506
In that paper, the last book, I discussed a little bit my feelings about a real book.

21:07.167 --> 21:12.012
But I should say that many of our sponsors are interested in single-page displays.

21:13.013 --> 21:15.737
As opposed to volume displays.

21:15.757 --> 21:18.720
As opposed to multiple-page displays, right?

21:19.308 --> 21:25.236
Well, when you get a chance to read that paper, why don't you let me know what you think about it.

21:25.256 --> 21:27.579
Well, the title of the last book refers to what?

21:28.520 --> 21:29.442
The last printed book?

21:30.042 --> 21:38.334
The title of the last book refers to the fact, to the idea that this would be, since this is every book, this would be the last book.

21:39.936 --> 21:41.077
Now, do you honestly pursue this?

21:42.259 --> 21:46.545
We honestly pursue that.

21:46.585 --> 21:48.387
Now, in order to

21:48.569 --> 21:56.959
In order for that to be a reality, it's got to be very cheap, it's got to look very good, and it's got to have vastly expanded utility over a normal book.

21:56.999 --> 22:03.686
And we think that our technology can bring all three of those together.

22:03.706 --> 22:12.957
And is the work on this at such a state to project when you might have a prototype?

22:12.977 --> 22:17.963
Yeah, I'd say probably on the order of two or three years.

22:17.983 --> 22:18.323
Really?

22:19.467 --> 22:21.870
Have you actually seen marketing it at that point?

22:22.170 --> 22:23.071
Well, I don't know.

22:23.271 --> 22:23.571
I don't know.

22:23.591 --> 22:29.338
We're working on a lot of different projects right now for this electronics.

22:29.358 --> 22:30.419
What's the most important thing?

22:30.539 --> 22:33.902
What's the most difficult thing right now with ink?

22:36.165 --> 22:38.848
The ink chemistry just recently came together.

22:39.749 --> 22:43.753
That chemistry that I showed you.

22:45.556 --> 22:49.621
It's a matter of making a very high-quality display.

22:49.982 --> 22:51.243
I didn't tell you about it.

22:51.283 --> 22:54.147
There's another half to this project.

22:54.428 --> 22:55.509
Well, actually, we don't.

22:55.789 --> 22:59.314
I've got a meeting downtown at noon, unfortunately.

22:59.334 --> 23:01.236
What time are you going to split?

23:01.256 --> 23:02.658
About 5, 10 minutes?

23:02.859 --> 23:04.220
Yeah, let's say about 10 minutes.

23:04.701 --> 23:07.845
Well, let's also say let's get back together at another point.

23:07.885 --> 23:08.746
Let's do that.

23:08.926 --> 23:09.427
I'd love to.

23:10.128 --> 23:13.993
What I'll be able to do now, I've seen the place, and let me

23:14.412 --> 23:15.613
Listen to this tape.

23:15.633 --> 23:15.854
Yeah.

23:16.094 --> 23:16.915
Read your stuff.

23:17.936 --> 23:22.261
And this is where I go to London next week.

23:22.281 --> 23:26.205
I go to the New British Library and see Paul Gaze.

23:26.225 --> 23:28.608
Sorry, who's the publisher?

23:28.708 --> 23:28.888
Holt.

23:29.028 --> 23:29.489
Holt, right.

23:29.929 --> 23:34.234
The same publisher of a copy of the book that I'll be sending you this afternoon.

23:34.274 --> 23:34.594
Correct.

23:34.614 --> 23:35.516
Under contract.

23:35.536 --> 23:37.157
It will be published in 1999.

23:37.257 --> 23:37.498
Yeah.

23:38.339 --> 23:38.559
Tremendous.

23:38.579 --> 23:44.065
Well, I've got to tell you, this sounds like one of the best books to have heard.

23:44.872 --> 23:46.832
I work, you know.
