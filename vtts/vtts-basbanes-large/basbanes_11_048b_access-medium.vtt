00:02.765 --> 00:10.332
I think it's an ideal location for the collection of presents.

00:11.192 --> 00:17.418
The reference and the actual collection of next speech finder is extremely important.

00:17.438 --> 00:21.461
Not many collections are kept out as well.

00:22.802 --> 00:24.304
Does it get a lot of use?

00:24.344 --> 00:25.465
Did a lot of people come here?

00:26.125 --> 00:31.590
During the summer, when we have reasonable scholars, and in the winter term, when we have the paparology class.

00:31.992 --> 00:33.754
We have a paparology class almost every year.

00:34.015 --> 00:34.836
And do you teach it?

00:35.296 --> 00:45.729
Well, sometimes I teach it, and sometimes we have my senior colleague, who would retire in two years, Professor Tannen.

00:46.510 --> 00:53.439
He has been here for about 20-many years, since 1975.

00:53.479 --> 00:56.363
He was brought here to replace Professor Udi.

00:56.984 --> 00:58.886
who was in charge of the collection.

00:58.946 --> 01:06.352
He was a professor of archaeology in the Department of Classical Studies for almost 40 years.

01:07.813 --> 01:08.694
This is fascinating.

01:08.714 --> 01:10.175
I didn't expect to find this today.

01:10.255 --> 01:12.397
I'm here to give a talk to them.

01:12.517 --> 01:15.540
I said to them, you know, when you take this class, it's not just a class.

01:15.980 --> 01:17.001
Just think of it.

01:17.582 --> 01:26.029
You're the first people, after so many hundreds of years, to touch this, to read this, and to learn.

01:26.954 --> 01:29.757
what it contains?

01:29.777 --> 01:31.559
Because of what?

01:31.579 --> 01:35.303
Because of the technology, or just because this stuff is being made available for them?

01:35.323 --> 01:36.644
Because it's available.

01:37.325 --> 01:41.810
I mean, think of how many big universities there are in the United States.

01:41.930 --> 01:44.773
How many of them do you think have a virus collection?

01:44.833 --> 01:45.514
I don't know.

01:45.574 --> 01:46.415
Very few.

01:47.116 --> 01:51.100
And very few have an active virus collection.

01:52.081 --> 01:53.783
And people operating it.

01:53.863 --> 01:55.645
And that's what you mean by active, of course.

01:56.789 --> 02:06.675
Well, I mean, certainly we don't have it just for display purposes, because when a collection ends up being like that, it's useless.

02:06.695 --> 02:11.388
And, of course, the whole point of materials at a university is that they're being used for scholarship.

02:11.428 --> 02:13.133
You're not just saving them.

02:13.153 --> 02:13.313
Exactly.

02:14.812 --> 02:16.514
We very much believe you, actually.

02:16.534 --> 02:17.896
Well, I would think so.

02:17.916 --> 02:18.738
That's great.

02:18.798 --> 02:21.161
I better get back to see .

02:21.181 --> 02:22.343
Put that on.

02:22.383 --> 02:22.603
Okay.

02:22.623 --> 02:23.184
Say it again.

02:23.504 --> 02:24.446
The largest library .

02:24.726 --> 02:26.549
The CIC Center for Library.

02:26.569 --> 02:27.250
Yeah.

02:27.270 --> 02:31.976
It stands for the Committee on Institutional Cooperation .

02:35.561 --> 02:38.245
Anyway, we also call it the Center for Library Initiatives.

02:38.265 --> 02:41.089
It's been in operation for about two years.

02:41.322 --> 02:43.405
And Nick, you can see some of the things here.

02:43.445 --> 02:53.960
We think we're saving or avoiding costs around $800,000 per year by jointly signing on to these databases.

02:54.060 --> 02:55.862
And I mentioned it.

02:55.882 --> 02:56.403
Okay, yeah.

02:56.904 --> 02:59.027
I hope I can talk to you.

02:59.047 --> 03:05.636
But with the Modern Language Association, this is the, you know, Michigan is providing that, and you can see.

03:05.656 --> 03:07.879
But this is something you can take and read at your leisure.

03:08.180 --> 03:10.603
But it's quite a...

03:11.090 --> 03:11.871
remarkable thing.

03:11.891 --> 03:16.858
What we're doing here, we're realizing from collective efforts what we can't do individually.

03:18.500 --> 03:21.605
Before I went off to see... Right.

03:21.625 --> 03:24.148
But I wanted to give you a copy of that.

03:24.168 --> 03:31.759
We were talking about the role of a library, and we were talking, and of course, you have a building now that's not even called a library anymore.

03:31.839 --> 03:33.100
It's called, what is it called?

03:35.404 --> 03:36.085
Oh, the media union.

03:36.125 --> 03:37.486
The media union.

03:37.527 --> 03:38.167
Tell me, what's that?

03:38.848 --> 03:40.050
What's wrong with library?

03:40.435 --> 03:41.036
Okay.

03:41.376 --> 03:43.037
Well, it has two libraries.

03:43.918 --> 03:55.208
We took two libraries, the art and architecture library, which is one, and the engineering library, and we brought them into this media union, but it's much more than a library.

03:55.228 --> 03:56.370
We have studios there.

03:56.390 --> 04:02.755
We have so many workstations, and we want, for example, I can speak from the library standpoint.

04:02.775 --> 04:07.860
We want those students to be able to sit down and look at a Frank Lloyd Wright book

04:09.106 --> 04:24.890
and be at a workstation and do some simulations to bring the old media, so to speak, i.e., the book, right in line with the most sophisticated electronic media.

04:25.151 --> 04:28.516
That's the reason we call it the media union.

04:28.536 --> 04:32.903
But we have a strong presence there in the library component.

04:32.923 --> 04:37.510
But that building is one that is yet to become.

04:37.777 --> 04:40.039
It's always evolving, so to speak.

04:40.059 --> 04:40.219
Yeah.

04:40.399 --> 04:41.640
So I hope you get to see it sometime.

04:41.821 --> 04:50.789
Of course, you know, you heard about that when they closed that military base at Fort Ord in California for their new school.

04:51.329 --> 04:53.211
And they didn't even put a library in the plans.

04:54.512 --> 04:56.674
Well, something under Chronicle of Higher Education, not too long.

04:56.714 --> 04:57.335
Did you see that?

04:57.975 --> 04:58.356
No, I didn't.

04:58.376 --> 04:59.717
Chronicle of Higher Education, is that the name?

04:59.737 --> 05:01.078
Chronicle of Higher Education.

05:01.138 --> 05:01.478
Okay.

05:01.498 --> 05:02.259
I gave it to Bill.

05:02.980 --> 05:04.401
You can probably go and get it right now.

05:04.481 --> 05:05.522
But here's what it said.

05:06.363 --> 05:14.694
They designed that campus, we found a library, and they've admitted, after three weeks, they made a serious mistake.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.036
Can I get that?

05:16.056 --> 05:16.157
Yeah.

05:16.177 --> 05:16.998
Very important.

05:17.058 --> 05:18.500
Oh, yeah.

05:18.540 --> 05:18.780
Okay.

05:20.162 --> 05:20.442
Bill?

05:20.462 --> 05:21.063
They're a target.

05:21.163 --> 05:22.605
I'm not a target, but I want to write about it.

05:22.866 --> 05:23.146
Bill?

05:24.488 --> 05:24.728
Bill?

05:25.790 --> 05:27.752
At that Monterey thing before?

05:27.913 --> 05:31.037
The Monterey where they accepted that building, that campus?

05:31.473 --> 05:38.361
California State University, like the 26th or 25th campus, and I told them there was a piece in the Carnival Education.

05:38.522 --> 05:40.244
Can you put your hand on that fairly fast?

05:41.846 --> 05:42.346
Right now?

05:42.446 --> 05:43.287
I think mine's at home.

05:43.388 --> 05:44.469
I keep a file on these things.

05:44.569 --> 05:46.692
Well, you must have called up this stuff real fast.

05:47.312 --> 05:48.494
No, but do you remember that piece?

05:48.674 --> 05:49.655
It was a photocopy.

05:49.695 --> 05:50.456
Bill, you remember that piece?

05:50.596 --> 05:51.597
No, I know exactly what it was.

05:51.658 --> 05:53.840
You said, after three weeks, they discovered it made a serious mistake.

05:53.860 --> 05:55.482
They're going to build this campus to our library, Tony.

05:55.542 --> 05:58.686
That's the second one in the university system.

05:58.706 --> 06:00.248
The first one was San Marcos.

06:00.633 --> 06:01.074
Well, St.

06:01.114 --> 06:03.037
Marcus has the library, because I have several consultants.

06:03.057 --> 06:07.303
They started, it was going to be electronic.

06:07.423 --> 06:09.406
It's called Information Rural Library.

06:09.426 --> 06:20.323
And they quickly learned they had, this is my recollection, Marion Reed is the librarian there, and she's the person to talk about the history in that play.

06:20.343 --> 06:21.104
But I've been there.

06:21.545 --> 06:23.768
Marion Reed built the library.

06:24.349 --> 06:27.113
They ended up starting out, I think, California.

06:27.397 --> 06:30.122
I was telling you about this in the car this morning.

06:30.422 --> 06:35.972
The San Marcos is not as gross as this, but this military base, they started out there.

06:36.833 --> 06:40.259
They started out there without the concept there would not be a library.

06:40.479 --> 06:47.852
That was the same in the other one, and then they had to build it, and they started in a storefront, and then it became a library on the campus.

06:47.992 --> 06:48.914
Is this in this article?

06:49.996 --> 06:51.278
No, that isn't in the article.

06:51.663 --> 06:54.287
Now, Marion is at Monterey or the other place?

06:54.488 --> 06:54.668
No, no.

06:54.688 --> 06:55.670
She's at San Marco.

06:55.710 --> 06:57.833
No, but it won't do you any good to call Marion.

06:57.853 --> 06:58.995
I know that personally.

06:59.015 --> 06:59.756
See, I was there.

07:00.037 --> 07:12.477
I was there when they... They started that campus, the whole campus off in a storefront, but they always wanted to build... They always wanted to build... No, they always wanted to build a library, their bill, at Marion, because I went out there as the consultant.

07:12.938 --> 07:14.380
They had the big plans and everything.

07:14.630 --> 07:16.492
At Monterey is a whole different .

07:16.512 --> 07:17.894
I mean, it wasn't even in the equation.

07:17.954 --> 07:19.375
They weren't building a library.

07:19.395 --> 07:19.515
No.

07:19.576 --> 07:20.637
At Monterey, they were not.

07:20.797 --> 07:21.558
At Monterey.

07:21.658 --> 07:23.600
A library that had .

07:23.940 --> 07:24.401
That's right.

07:24.421 --> 07:25.282
Well, that's .

07:25.702 --> 07:27.144
Yeah, at Monterey and .

07:27.164 --> 07:27.184
.

07:27.204 --> 07:27.224
.

07:27.244 --> 07:27.945
They're learning resources.

07:27.965 --> 07:29.146
Yeah, there's information.

07:29.847 --> 07:29.947
Yeah.

07:29.967 --> 07:32.030
Jim May is the head librarian there.

07:32.050 --> 07:33.191
What's his name again?

07:33.251 --> 07:33.731
May, M-A-Y.

07:34.632 --> 07:35.974
Jim May.

07:35.994 --> 07:37.255
And you can even tell him why I called him.

07:37.295 --> 07:38.136
Let me see if I can find that out.

07:38.156 --> 07:41.380
I'm going to start the Friends of the Non-Library.

07:41.528 --> 07:42.169
Excuse me, man.

07:42.189 --> 07:46.796
But at Monterey, they started off with the concept they do not need a library.

07:46.816 --> 07:48.018
San Marcos is a different story.

07:48.038 --> 07:49.921
Was May part of this?

07:49.941 --> 07:51.263
Well, he was employed later.

07:51.683 --> 07:56.230
But after three weeks, and the article states this, after three weeks, they discovered they made a serious mistake.

07:56.250 --> 07:56.911
What year was it?

07:56.951 --> 07:59.495
Well, serious in terms of public relations or what?

07:59.515 --> 08:05.004
No, serious in terms of serving the academic needs of the faculty and students.

08:05.444 --> 08:06.726
What year is it?

08:06.746 --> 08:07.127
Right now.

08:07.147 --> 08:08.189
Over the last couple of years.

08:08.209 --> 08:09.130
Yeah.

08:09.150 --> 08:10.051
And the article just appeared.

08:10.071 --> 08:10.472
It went around then.

08:11.009 --> 08:13.753
The article just appeared in about three weeks ago.

08:13.773 --> 08:14.394
It went around me.

08:14.814 --> 08:17.118
I heard about it at a conference at Smith College.

08:17.218 --> 08:19.501
And you started talking about it, but it left me.

08:19.521 --> 08:26.130
And then I was out at Oberlin last week, and the new president there gave a talk, and she mentioned it in some of the articles.

08:26.150 --> 08:27.973
So this is known in the circles.

08:29.214 --> 08:33.400
And then a couple people actually went out there, and there was still no books there.

08:33.420 --> 08:35.944
They had some shelves up, some metal shelving.

08:36.865 --> 08:37.746
No Stephen King?

08:38.748 --> 08:39.008
What is that?

08:39.258 --> 08:43.082
Of course, it's a very technically-oriented school, I guess, too, in its defense.

08:43.102 --> 08:46.446
You have to say it's a liberal arts school among any stretch.

08:46.526 --> 08:49.949
It does have very technical... They just figured they could do this without books.

08:50.650 --> 08:54.014
Everything... The kids would work at home, and they'd be able to access this.

08:54.214 --> 08:55.916
We've been here an hour and a half.

08:55.936 --> 08:58.398
Your interview is over, but we're going to go get a bite to eat.

08:58.559 --> 08:58.859
Okay.

09:00.180 --> 09:04.045
I did ask them about the vet, the... What do we call that thing again now?

09:04.645 --> 09:06.507
The place that's not called the library?

09:06.948 --> 09:07.929
The media union.

09:07.949 --> 09:08.269
The media union.

09:08.502 --> 09:11.545
We're coming back on that to save you this piece.

09:11.585 --> 09:13.327
I know, I know, but I'm just asking a question.

09:13.347 --> 09:13.908
That's all.

09:14.088 --> 09:14.328
Okay.

09:14.348 --> 09:15.730
You can ask all the questions you want.

09:15.770 --> 09:18.292
Your interview's over, but you can keep asking questions.

09:18.312 --> 09:18.412
Okay.

09:18.533 --> 09:18.793
No.

09:19.213 --> 09:20.455
No, you can talk to me.

09:20.515 --> 09:22.116
I don't have an appointment to a club.

09:22.276 --> 09:24.879
Well, really, I think we've covered the stuff that I want.

09:24.899 --> 09:25.200
I don't know.

09:25.220 --> 09:26.861
We can go on.

09:26.881 --> 09:31.426
Well, I mean, I guess, but Michigan's not moving away from libraries to media unions.

09:31.606 --> 09:34.149
But the library school's now called the information.

09:34.309 --> 09:34.609
Yeah.

09:34.689 --> 09:35.190
Is that right?

09:35.210 --> 09:37.092
It's a library school.

09:37.207 --> 09:39.950
Library has been dropped from a nominate place.

09:39.970 --> 09:40.771
But we're not at the end of it.

09:40.791 --> 09:41.833
It seemed like that's a trend.

09:41.853 --> 09:45.096
I was telling Toby, 70 percent of our graduates still work in libraries.

09:46.058 --> 09:46.959
So what do you call it now?

09:46.979 --> 09:47.319
What school?

09:47.680 --> 09:48.981
It's called the School of Information.

09:49.562 --> 09:53.867
It used to be called the School of Library and Information.

09:53.887 --> 09:55.889
The School of Information and Library Studies.

09:56.029 --> 09:57.912
So why did they drop the Library Studies?

09:57.932 --> 09:59.754
Because they wouldn't dare drop information.

10:00.054 --> 10:01.876
Well, let me ask that one.

10:01.896 --> 10:02.517
I don't know why.

10:03.498 --> 10:06.522
Is there a change in emphasis, though?

10:07.261 --> 10:15.434
I think there is a greater emphasis on the information technology than previous.

10:15.454 --> 10:16.736
But we still give—go ahead.

10:17.497 --> 10:18.559
You still give?

10:18.579 --> 10:25.810
We still offer degrees, and we still give primary emphasis to libraries, even though it's not in the title.

10:25.992 --> 10:28.415
libraries, archives.

10:28.435 --> 10:29.696
That's what I said.

10:29.716 --> 10:30.738
What you call yourself is what you believe you are.

10:30.758 --> 10:32.299
We take it easy.

10:33.020 --> 10:34.482
I think we have plenty of material here.

10:34.562 --> 10:35.323
I love it.

10:35.623 --> 10:36.945
I'll send you, um, please.

10:36.965 --> 10:37.546
Materials.

10:38.407 --> 10:38.707
Will you?

10:39.127 --> 10:39.388
Yeah.

10:40.850 --> 10:44.354
This is one of my copies, but I'll send all this to you, Nick.

10:44.694 --> 10:49.580
Here's, for example, one way of looking at what's probably going to happen.

10:49.600 --> 10:50.661
Oh, I've got to have this, yeah.

10:50.701 --> 10:54.025
We're moving from facility-centric to user-centric.

10:54.292 --> 11:04.005
centralized collections, distributed collections, just in case, you know, just buying a book, just in case someone wants it, to just in time, to where the value is probably on collection size.

11:04.145 --> 11:05.847
Now, this could be controversial.

11:05.867 --> 11:10.373
Well, just in case strategies, isn't it?

11:11.254 --> 11:13.537
You just kind of slid right by that, just in case.

11:13.577 --> 11:15.520
You buy a book just in case somebody wants it?

11:17.222 --> 11:17.362
Mm-hmm.

11:17.382 --> 11:19.725
Do you know how many books that we buy that no one has a bucket?

11:19.908 --> 11:23.632
But maybe not in your lifetime, though.

11:23.652 --> 11:24.372
That's my point.

11:24.412 --> 11:26.514
For the pro album, I don't want to jump ahead.

11:26.795 --> 11:28.676
You know, I say this at my talk tonight.

11:30.458 --> 11:33.761
You know, I went to the Boston Air.

11:33.821 --> 11:35.283
They were buying for me.

11:35.323 --> 11:36.044
They saved me.

11:36.244 --> 11:36.744
It was there.

11:36.984 --> 11:44.512
This was on Samuel Pepys, and it was on the codicils to his will, which I knew was only in this catalog of his library.

11:44.532 --> 11:46.113
Not in the earlier one, not in the later one.

11:46.334 --> 11:46.954
And I had to have it.

11:47.575 --> 11:48.936
And they had it, and they bought it for me.

11:49.102 --> 11:55.891
Now, when you say, just in case, you're saying, well, maybe somebody might need it.

11:56.392 --> 11:56.872
Maybe not.

11:57.293 --> 11:58.655
But maybe a hundred years from now.

11:59.276 --> 12:01.178
And this is what bothers me, frankly.

12:01.198 --> 12:02.180
Now I'm showing my stripes.

12:02.780 --> 12:03.361
Timeless, timeless, timeless.

12:03.381 --> 12:08.628
Now I'm showing my stripes just a little bit when I see a Cornell and they say, nobody uses this biology collection.

12:09.109 --> 12:09.590
Nobody uses it.

12:09.610 --> 12:10.731
We don't have anybody teaching it.

12:10.751 --> 12:16.158
And they're thinking of getting rid of it, even though they have one at the great agricultural schools there, you know.

12:16.399 --> 12:16.699
They do.

12:17.020 --> 12:17.320
I said,

12:17.722 --> 12:23.610
Don't you have an obligation to students yet unborn that may be somebody coming along in 50 or 75 years?

12:24.030 --> 12:29.377
And that's why I was kind of edging when we were talking earlier about the role of the librarian.

12:30.659 --> 12:32.682
That is part of your role, don't you think?

12:32.702 --> 12:37.208
Well, I just came from a session this morning about our selectors.

12:38.109 --> 12:39.330
And Toby and I have talked about this.

12:39.350 --> 12:41.774
I don't see our notes here.

12:41.794 --> 12:44.337
But I was stuck with addressing things like

12:44.890 --> 12:49.097
The changing role of the libraries, these are the people who select the books.

12:49.117 --> 12:53.884
And the changing role, because... Well, Alexis, they call them censors.

12:54.265 --> 12:57.249
You can joke on this.

12:57.389 --> 13:00.795
Yes, but see, here's... This is called role of the selector.

13:00.875 --> 13:01.776
Role of the selector.

13:01.796 --> 13:03.138
These are the people who select the books.

13:03.459 --> 13:04.701
Anticipating the future.

13:04.741 --> 13:06.123
Are you going to give me a copy of this?

13:06.243 --> 13:07.285
If you like it, you like this.

13:07.405 --> 13:08.687
Oh, well, I would like it, yeah.

13:09.545 --> 13:13.350
This is the giant sucking sound that we're always talking about.

13:13.430 --> 13:14.292
Right, right.

13:14.312 --> 13:17.115
But, yeah, we talk about the role, how it's changing, you know.

13:19.198 --> 13:20.420
What was this printed up for?

13:20.440 --> 13:21.481
Was this for a talk or something?

13:21.502 --> 13:24.205
Yeah, just for a talk this morning, which I... Oh, you gave this warning?

13:24.726 --> 13:24.886
Yeah.

13:24.906 --> 13:25.948
Do you have a copy of this?

13:26.088 --> 13:27.670
I'll make you a copy, yeah.

13:28.411 --> 13:30.574
Well, could explain it.

13:31.263 --> 13:36.288
We talk about some trends here affecting selection, you know, um, greater faculty contact.

13:36.308 --> 13:38.891
Well, it's in the future is what you were just talking about there.

13:39.031 --> 13:40.192
Exactly, yeah.

13:40.212 --> 13:45.938
This, this, uh, value center management is a, is a new, new budget tool here at the university.

13:46.399 --> 13:50.943
See, I've been, since I've been here, I've been able to get the library taken right off the top.

13:50.963 --> 13:56.489
Now they're talking about having the deans to, to determine how much money will come to the library.

13:57.250 --> 13:59.532
And I told them, I said, I don't know if any university

13:59.798 --> 14:02.681
that has ever done this, that would libraries come out better.

14:03.021 --> 14:15.735
At Indiana University, for example, they built this fine library on Indiana limestone down there, and the librarian down there a few years ago said, I've got to have a storage facility.

14:15.755 --> 14:17.878
We can't put any more, and we can't build onto the building.

14:17.938 --> 14:20.581
Well, he went to the deans, made a presentation.

14:20.601 --> 14:21.682
Dean said, thumbs down.

14:21.782 --> 14:22.743
This is at IU here.

14:23.544 --> 14:25.206
This is at Indiana University.

14:25.226 --> 14:25.806
Yeah, yeah.

14:26.467 --> 14:29.350
And someplace it's called Responsibility Center Management.

14:29.633 --> 14:30.734
What's it called?

14:30.814 --> 14:31.335
Responsibility?

14:31.355 --> 14:34.057
Responsibility-centered management.

14:34.137 --> 14:36.739
Or budgeting.

14:36.759 --> 14:38.101
Anyway, I don't know of any university.

14:38.161 --> 14:39.882
At Vanderbilt University, let me give you another example.

14:39.902 --> 14:42.665
You don't have any university, what, to finish that sentence?

14:42.745 --> 14:55.476
Well, I don't know of any university library that has engaged in responsibility-centered budgeting or responsibility-centered management that is better off after engaging in that new budgeting technique than before.

14:56.497 --> 14:57.598
Vanderbilt, case in point.

14:58.220 --> 15:00.342
The School of Engineering there is going bankrupt.

15:00.763 --> 15:07.490
They have not bought any—the dean there of the School of Engineering cannot give the library any money to buy engineering books.

15:07.770 --> 15:11.574
They're able to keep most of their journals, and engineers do read, believe it or not.

15:12.415 --> 15:17.541
So now, I told the provost there some time ago, I said, this is serious business.

15:18.201 --> 15:18.922
What's going to happen?

15:18.982 --> 15:20.804
You can't go back and buy those engineering books.

15:21.525 --> 15:23.247
This is responsibility-centered budgeting.

15:24.148 --> 15:26.370
They called down there, each job on its own bottom.

15:26.570 --> 15:28.793
But the library is at the mercy of all these deans.

15:29.434 --> 15:30.696
See, here I've been able to keep this.

15:31.337 --> 15:33.380
They printed the order of the publishing.

15:33.400 --> 15:33.500
Yeah.

15:33.520 --> 15:34.562
But see, I've been buying.

15:34.582 --> 15:35.624
That's what we were saying earlier.

15:36.245 --> 15:36.345
Yeah.

15:36.365 --> 15:36.465
Yeah.

15:36.485 --> 15:36.625
Mm-hmm.

15:36.645 --> 15:38.147
And why some of those books maybe got better.

15:38.288 --> 15:39.149
Right.

15:39.610 --> 15:43.515
But anyway, here you can see significant increase in digital resources.

15:44.357 --> 15:47.862
Access to information may be more critical than acquisition.

15:48.483 --> 15:50.786
I don't know.

15:50.806 --> 15:50.887
Wow.

15:50.907 --> 15:50.987
Wow.

15:51.007 --> 15:55.193
More resources acquired or licensed outside of libraries.

15:55.814 --> 15:59.399
And here we navigate and increasingly become more important.

15:59.419 --> 16:01.221
I'm talking about survival here, man.

16:01.241 --> 16:01.401
Yeah.

16:02.042 --> 16:02.443
Survival.

16:02.823 --> 16:03.985
The selector.

16:04.786 --> 16:10.834
But you know, before I get going on my little thing, you were about to say, you know how many books people buy that are never used?

16:11.014 --> 16:13.037
That is, it's got to be a consideration.

16:13.197 --> 16:15.520
I mean, my cute story, Toby, let me talk about it.

16:15.560 --> 16:21.027
My cute story notwithstanding, that does bother you.

16:21.148 --> 16:25.213
You know any book exhibits are made without use?

16:25.852 --> 16:28.896
I'm sorry, well, how many of them?

16:29.437 --> 16:29.818
That's right.

16:29.878 --> 16:30.519
Well, okay.

16:30.839 --> 16:31.039
So?

16:31.880 --> 16:32.802
Use is relative.

16:32.922 --> 16:34.965
Use is self-absorbed.

16:35.005 --> 16:50.426
What concerns publishers of journals and electronic journals in electronic journal format, if libraries pay per use or per drink, so to speak, each time a journal article is used, if we pay on that basis, publishers may lose their shirts.

16:50.487 --> 16:52.990
Because there are many journal articles that are never read.

16:53.847 --> 16:55.449
That's why they cost so much.

16:55.929 --> 16:56.470
Exactly.

16:56.670 --> 16:57.832
That's right, yeah.

16:57.852 --> 16:59.974
Because they figure they're only going to make it on one shot.

17:00.254 --> 17:00.454
Yeah.

17:01.235 --> 17:01.736
Oh, could be.

17:01.756 --> 17:04.619
And that's what they're saying at Stanford.

17:04.639 --> 17:08.043
You know, we still haven't figured out how you make people pay when you access it.

17:08.063 --> 17:08.183
Right.

17:08.203 --> 17:11.287
Because otherwise, putting it on here, the guy who writes it, is not going to make anything.

17:12.188 --> 17:14.871
And there are those of us who do live by our pens.

17:15.291 --> 17:16.753
That's right.

17:16.793 --> 17:17.514
You want this now?

17:17.554 --> 17:18.095
Yeah, I do.

17:18.215 --> 17:19.756
Well, if you can copy it or whatever.

17:19.816 --> 17:20.077
Okay.

17:20.858 --> 17:21.679
And I can copy.

17:21.739 --> 17:22.960
I'll send this to you.

17:23.446 --> 17:38.502
or have that copied now if you like this is only one one of the i'd love to take it with me okay yeah good i believe in securing territory okay now i gave you yeah that thing on the consortium you see it yeah i gave you that yeah let me get this
