00:03.929 --> 00:11.556
He seems without humor, but he has a little more than they say.

00:12.777 --> 00:20.465
I loved, by the way, when you were on the Today Show the other day, you corrected Jane Pauly on the pronunciation of your name.

00:22.366 --> 00:24.308
I didn't like what she did, though.

00:24.328 --> 00:31.495
She had never gone on the fucking program because she hadn't read the book and they hadn't read it.

00:31.615 --> 00:32.976
They just gave her a list of questions.

00:32.996 --> 00:33.717
She had a paper.

00:33.983 --> 00:36.847
That's the official given event that she asked.

00:36.907 --> 00:38.510
That's the way it works, though.

00:38.530 --> 00:39.591
They have four minutes.

00:39.691 --> 00:40.933
It's probably a four-minute segment.

00:40.953 --> 00:42.756
You know why I picked that topic?

00:42.776 --> 00:43.417
Well, you know why?

00:43.617 --> 00:49.986
Because everything on television is what they've read in the New York Times two days earlier, which is what, there was a big piece on that in the Times.

00:50.948 --> 00:55.695
And you'll find that I'm really not going to ask you that much about that experience today.

00:55.715 --> 00:58.539
Well, it's in the book, though, and we'll certainly touch on it.

00:58.579 --> 01:00.582
Anything I have to say is in the book on that subject.

01:00.747 --> 01:01.468
I know that.

01:01.508 --> 01:02.850
I wrote it very carefully.

01:03.311 --> 01:10.021
That's why I say it seems foolish of me to ask questions that you've answered quite thoroughly in the book.

01:11.644 --> 01:12.245
Where do we start?

01:12.285 --> 01:28.129
The first time we met, and the piece I wrote, you said that you've had so many experiences as an actor, directing plays, doing movies, but that what matters to you most in the world is the respect of your children.

01:28.871 --> 01:29.151
True.

01:30.008 --> 01:30.809
I'm a Greek.

01:30.829 --> 01:31.310
You're a Greek.

01:32.832 --> 01:33.192
Go ahead.

01:33.212 --> 01:34.073
When they read this book?

01:34.354 --> 01:35.235
That was my question.

01:35.355 --> 01:35.956
I was anxious.

01:36.937 --> 01:38.078
I was very anxious.

01:38.239 --> 01:39.420
I thought, would they like it?

01:39.761 --> 01:41.222
And the two boys read it first.

01:41.923 --> 01:44.006
One is 49, one is 40.

01:44.687 --> 01:47.210
And they called me up and said, I'm proud of you.

01:47.230 --> 01:48.832
So you know what the best of a Greek thought.

01:49.193 --> 01:50.975
You know, it felt great.

01:50.995 --> 01:53.318
And then the girls began to read it.

01:53.478 --> 01:57.423
One of them said that she had a few objections, but basically she liked it.

01:57.483 --> 01:58.665
Sort of like 90%.

01:59.236 --> 02:04.724
And then my other daughter read it, and she said she was hurt by one thing, which is the way I treat her mother.

02:04.744 --> 02:07.307
She and her mother were very close, closer than the other children were.

02:07.327 --> 02:12.354
The other children were not so close, but she was very close to her, and that hurt her.

02:12.374 --> 02:16.119
She liked the book in every way except that, she said.

02:16.680 --> 02:18.663
And this kind of leads into another question.

02:18.903 --> 02:20.385
I was apprehensive.

02:20.405 --> 02:21.787
You're about to say that.

02:21.807 --> 02:24.771
Yeah, because you're so frank and so candid.

02:25.460 --> 02:26.762
about everything in your life.

02:26.802 --> 02:31.868
And some might even say, Jesus, he's too candid.

02:33.030 --> 02:34.311
Maybe that's a twin question.

02:34.372 --> 02:38.136
Why did you feel the need to be so candid?

02:38.457 --> 02:42.843
I mean, you're talking about, you know, everything.

02:42.863 --> 02:46.007
Your love life, your womanizing, that's your word.

02:46.567 --> 02:47.348
I hate the word.

02:47.489 --> 02:49.371
I can contest the word in the book.

02:49.671 --> 02:53.977
Well, yeah, but you also say that I've been here someplace.

02:54.157 --> 02:54.758
It, uh,

02:56.763 --> 02:58.545
I learned a lot from it.

02:58.565 --> 03:00.087
Well, I'll get to it, but you use that.

03:00.107 --> 03:05.092
Well, you have it in quotes when you say on page 380 that you're womanizing saved your life.

03:05.713 --> 03:06.414
Did I put it in quotes?

03:07.035 --> 03:10.298
Let's look it up, page 380.

03:10.498 --> 03:11.359
I think you did, yeah.

03:12.260 --> 03:12.921
I read the books.

03:13.001 --> 03:15.424
It's silly to go and do an interview if you don't know.

03:15.444 --> 03:17.446
You can't interview this book without having any book.

03:18.047 --> 03:20.069
I've done so many of these, I feel.

03:20.089 --> 03:21.611
I'm the book review editor, by the way.

03:21.771 --> 03:23.513
Oh, you are?

03:25.045 --> 03:32.136
You kind of just throw that in.

03:33.098 --> 03:34.039
You can test the word.

03:34.861 --> 03:35.582
I don't like the word.

03:35.902 --> 03:39.188
I don't like the word because I think it makes it mechanical.

03:40.389 --> 03:41.451
Like women aren't people.

03:41.551 --> 03:50.826
If you take advantage of everything that the feminist movement is against, the womanizing to sort of take one after another, use them and throw them away.

03:50.866 --> 03:52.048
That's what it suggests.

03:52.467 --> 03:53.629
And I never did that.

03:53.729 --> 03:56.833
I was always friends with them and they were always someone with whom I had a connection.

03:57.453 --> 04:03.842
They were in a play of mine or in a movie of mine or some common interest or at the actor's studio with me or something like that.

04:03.942 --> 04:11.472
So it wasn't that I went out fucking secretaries or prostitutes or anything.

04:11.492 --> 04:14.916
It had to do with people who were equals with me.

04:15.036 --> 04:19.842
I mean, the whole thing was conducted with conversation in one thing or another.

04:19.862 --> 04:21.124
I mean, we meant something to each other.

04:21.475 --> 04:28.705
But the suggestion that, however you wish to describe this activity, that it saved your life.

04:29.246 --> 04:29.847
Yeah, it did.

04:30.748 --> 04:35.094
I didn't mean to get into this so early in the interview, by the way.

04:35.114 --> 04:38.058
It was no problem at all, in any order you want.

04:38.138 --> 04:46.470
But it made me feel, at the beginning, that I wasn't just an outsider, that I wasn't just a funny-looking kid.

04:46.754 --> 04:50.397
I look all right here now, probably fair, but I was pretty funny looking.

04:50.598 --> 04:52.159
He was a pretty handsome guy.

04:52.179 --> 04:56.883
I was very tense, very unsure of myself, and it helped in every way like that.

04:57.324 --> 05:01.868
But it also taught me a lot of, I had no sisters, it taught me a lot about the other sex, too.

05:01.888 --> 05:07.133
And it fed my curiosity, and then when I came to the right place by women, I understood them much better.

05:07.153 --> 05:13.639
You contend that with the single notable reception of Brando, that women are the better actors?

05:14.092 --> 05:15.855
a little bit better on a whole.

05:15.875 --> 05:21.684
If I had to make any generalization about them, I'd say I got more respect for them as actors.

05:21.704 --> 05:24.027
It's more natural for a woman to act, it seems to me.

05:24.788 --> 05:31.879
They resent that when I say that, but it is more natural because that's according to whom they're going to see that now, do they not?

05:32.179 --> 05:34.964
Men don't particularly, and I don't think they do anyway.

05:34.984 --> 05:37.628
And they play up to everybody.

05:37.648 --> 05:40.392
They wonder what will interest them, and they play up to them.

05:40.492 --> 05:42.495
They're acting a lot of the time in that sense.

05:42.678 --> 05:44.300
I don't mean falsely, but truly.

05:44.901 --> 05:49.568
The acting tradition, though, comes from men, doesn't it, from the Greeks and the Shakespeareans?

05:49.588 --> 05:50.970
The Shakespeareans, of course.

05:50.990 --> 05:51.731
Yeah, men playing women.

05:51.791 --> 05:53.714
Men playing women, even.

05:53.734 --> 05:56.237
The Greeks and the Shakespeareans, men playing women.

05:56.257 --> 06:01.885
Yeah, and yet, since they've developed their own tradition, you feel that they've surpassed the men?

06:02.846 --> 06:03.988
It's more natural.

06:04.008 --> 06:04.549
It's more natural.

06:04.569 --> 06:05.150
It seems to me.

06:05.210 --> 06:07.313
I may be wrong, but it seems more natural to me.

06:07.433 --> 06:11.098
Every time a woman comes in here, she's entering this...

06:11.652 --> 06:12.714
She's entering a set.

06:13.615 --> 06:15.157
You watch when they come in.

06:15.197 --> 06:18.903
They're charming and entering a set, and they want to make a certain impression.

06:19.223 --> 06:20.606
They're nice, that's all.

06:21.106 --> 06:22.609
Life's more interesting to them.

06:22.629 --> 06:24.511
A lot of men resent it, like Brando did.

06:24.552 --> 06:29.399
A lot of men I know don't like the fact that they're actors, and don't like acting.

06:29.419 --> 06:32.143
It's humiliating to them.

06:32.163 --> 06:33.345
Ask Brando, I don't know.

06:33.365 --> 06:35.067
It's true, though.

06:36.049 --> 06:37.631
George Scott was that way for a long time.

06:37.651 --> 06:38.132
He hated it.

06:38.737 --> 06:40.840
He hated what?

06:41.081 --> 06:41.581
Acting.

06:41.601 --> 06:45.588
He hated acting, and yet, I mean, that's a paradox.

06:46.229 --> 06:47.831
He's a damn good actor, very able.

06:47.871 --> 06:49.133
Well, why even continue with it?

06:49.153 --> 06:50.255
I mean, to make a living?

06:50.435 --> 06:52.438
What are you talking about?

06:52.458 --> 06:53.360
He makes millions.

06:53.380 --> 06:56.044
So that obviously, I mean, to make a living, that's why they do it.

06:56.064 --> 06:57.506
Do you like to review books you don't like?

06:57.586 --> 06:57.786
No.

06:57.887 --> 07:00.070
No, of course not.

07:00.691 --> 07:02.674
Are you still as angry as you used to be?

07:02.714 --> 07:05.698
You say towards the end that, okay, I'm a bourgeois.

07:05.938 --> 07:06.258
I'm not.

07:06.278 --> 07:07.300
No, I'm just kidding.

07:07.320 --> 07:07.981
You're just kidding.

07:08.001 --> 07:09.002
We'll say that.

07:09.102 --> 07:09.723
No, but I'm not.

07:09.903 --> 07:10.985
But you settled, you all.

07:11.165 --> 07:11.786
I'm not angry.

07:11.846 --> 07:12.607
I'm happily married.

07:13.788 --> 07:17.153
The great thing in my life was doing that book you got at your right elbow.

07:17.393 --> 07:20.477
That was a great thing that I ever did in my life because it said everything.

07:20.537 --> 07:22.440
I talked about everybody and relieved me a lot.

07:22.520 --> 07:24.763
You know, it eased everything out.

07:24.783 --> 07:26.465
So I finally spoke of it.

07:26.845 --> 07:27.306
Was it?

07:27.455 --> 07:29.057
A therapeutic exercise?

07:29.217 --> 07:32.280
No, it was a desire to write everything I felt about everybody.

07:32.300 --> 07:35.083
Call that therapeutic therapy.

07:35.143 --> 07:40.269
When you say, was it a therapeutic exercise, it sounds like it was done as part of an exercise.

07:40.289 --> 07:40.689
Therapy?

07:40.769 --> 07:41.931
It wasn't a therapy at all, no.

07:42.451 --> 07:43.192
I enjoy it every day.

07:43.252 --> 07:45.234
I work three and a half years on it every morning.

07:45.254 --> 07:45.895
It's marvelous.

07:45.975 --> 07:48.838
And deep down you're telling a story, too.

07:49.679 --> 07:50.700
My own development.

07:50.720 --> 07:51.741
Your own development.

07:52.227 --> 07:59.059
Would you like to consider this, I mean, and I hate to search for absolutes, but as your monument?

08:00.221 --> 08:03.166
Not a monument, but as my final word.

08:03.207 --> 08:09.818
As I go down, I mean, I hope I live twenty more years, but as I go down, I say, well, I did that book.

08:10.540 --> 08:11.742
I did nothing else.

08:11.762 --> 08:12.102
Really?

08:12.804 --> 08:15.889
Well, how many movies and plays do you do, written by other people?

08:16.088 --> 08:23.296
about other things with actors and everything else, you know, that doesn't say even the best of them, exactly what you feel this book does.

08:24.637 --> 08:35.690
Perhaps you might even give me a statement on that as to why writing is more satisfying because it is an individual creative work, whereas the other creative endeavors are by committee.

08:35.730 --> 08:36.711
That's also the subject.

08:37.452 --> 08:37.712
Sorry?

08:37.912 --> 08:39.514
It's also the subject.

08:40.490 --> 08:48.623
writing can be creative, it can be creative about a lot of different things, but this subject was of final interest for me.

08:49.905 --> 08:56.996
You've, despite all the years you've spent in New York and in Hollywood, which you say you detest by the way, I don't like it.

08:57.717 --> 08:59.600
I don't like anything about it.

08:59.680 --> 09:02.785
I mean, you're clearly an American man, but

09:02.967 --> 09:06.291
A lot of the Anatolians seems to have stayed with you.

09:06.472 --> 09:06.712
Right.

09:06.932 --> 09:09.095
Is that a correct assessment?

09:09.235 --> 09:10.537
Absolutely.

09:10.557 --> 09:15.363
Would you describe an Anatolian particularly as regards yourself?

09:15.544 --> 09:31.445
Well, an Anatolian is a Greek who lives under Turkish domination, and they develop qualities of survival, of being clever, qualities that I don't particularly like, of being clever.

09:31.485 --> 09:32.586
I don't know what the word for it is.

09:33.578 --> 09:42.950
but being sly, not quite saying the truth, getting along at whatever cost, those are qualities I didn't like and I've had to get rid of.

09:42.970 --> 09:49.038
I mean, I spoke out in this book, I spoke out directly and frankly without trying to make an impression.

09:49.058 --> 09:56.728
So this book is sort of the end of my development from being an Amazonian to being what I am now, which is not an American, but which is sort of a citizen of the world.

09:56.748 --> 10:00.433
I mean, I don't believe I'm any particular New Yorker or anything else.

10:00.453 --> 10:01.915
I think all people are the same.

10:02.924 --> 10:03.865
Is that clear what I said?

10:03.885 --> 10:04.446
It is, yeah.

10:04.466 --> 10:09.251
And you also described the mask, the Anatolian mask that you developed.

10:09.271 --> 10:09.571
Smile.

10:09.691 --> 10:10.572
And the Anatolian smile.

10:10.612 --> 10:10.732
Smile.

10:10.752 --> 10:11.313
Let's get along.

10:11.473 --> 10:12.274
I'm a cute guy.

10:12.314 --> 10:13.115
I'm a smart guy.

10:13.175 --> 10:13.936
I'm a funny guy.

10:14.056 --> 10:14.857
Look at you.

10:15.477 --> 10:16.238
I mean, you do the same.

10:16.258 --> 10:17.499
You get the same smile.

10:18.200 --> 10:18.741
That's the Anatolian smile.

10:18.761 --> 10:19.982
You probably had a bad thought.

10:20.002 --> 10:21.784
You're covering it up.

10:21.804 --> 10:22.605
That's the way we are.

10:23.466 --> 10:24.647
But anyway, you have to get over it.

10:24.787 --> 10:26.048
You do get over it.

10:26.068 --> 10:27.009
I mean, not you.

10:27.029 --> 10:28.150
No, I know what you're saying.

10:28.191 --> 10:30.633
Excuse my presumption, but we all have to get over it.

10:30.653 --> 10:32.475
We have to say, look, we're as good as anybody else.

10:32.742 --> 10:40.292
And when you're brought up in Turkey and you're a Greek and you leave the country at the age of four and you're glad to get out of there.

10:40.852 --> 10:41.874
Well, I'm just quoting you.

10:41.914 --> 10:47.601
You mentioned the Anatolian Greek tactic of successfully blending in with the Turkish oppressors.

10:47.901 --> 10:48.802
Do you think that's true?

10:48.822 --> 10:49.984
Of course it's true.

10:50.665 --> 10:52.467
I spoke Greek at home and Turkish on the street.

10:54.430 --> 10:55.851
Are you still fluent in these languages?

10:56.012 --> 10:57.113
Yeah, I speak Turkish and Greek.

10:58.763 --> 10:59.504
Both of them.

10:59.544 --> 10:59.805
Really?

10:59.845 --> 11:01.107
You get along both countries, yeah.

11:01.287 --> 11:07.356
Now, when you came to this country, I imagine you quickly tried to assimilate yourself and become an emerita.

11:07.376 --> 11:07.757
You got it.

11:08.538 --> 11:13.645
And perhaps this might explain anxiously assimilate.

11:13.666 --> 11:14.947
I was anxious about it.

11:14.967 --> 11:15.789
I want to be part of it.

11:16.950 --> 11:18.793
It explains by going to Williams College.

11:18.813 --> 11:20.095
What the hell did I go to?

11:20.235 --> 11:21.477
I went to Bates, by the way.

11:21.537 --> 11:21.858
Huh?

11:21.878 --> 11:24.602
I went to Bates College, which is not unlike Williams.

11:25.055 --> 11:25.936
Oh, not unlike it?

11:26.016 --> 11:26.718
Full of goys?

11:26.738 --> 11:27.579
Full of goys?

11:27.619 --> 11:28.861
I was the only Greek kid there.

11:29.542 --> 11:33.368
I waited for four years.

11:33.488 --> 11:39.137
I waited on table to a lot of elitist kids that were too nice to know they were elitist.

11:39.157 --> 11:41.280
I have to feel that was one of the most impressionable things.

11:41.300 --> 11:41.621
You're right.

11:41.641 --> 11:42.622
That's ever happened to you.

11:42.843 --> 11:43.363
You're right.

11:43.384 --> 11:44.065
I never got over it.

11:44.365 --> 11:46.709
I mean, having to wait on these bastards.

11:46.809 --> 11:47.550
They weren't bastards.

11:47.570 --> 11:48.852
They were nice kids.

11:49.658 --> 11:50.179
They were all right.

11:50.199 --> 11:52.441
They threw roles in me a couple of times, but they were nice kids.

11:52.461 --> 11:53.182
What did they call you?

11:53.342 --> 11:53.743
You remember?

11:54.424 --> 11:54.964
Uh-huh.

11:55.525 --> 11:56.907
What did they call you?

11:58.068 --> 11:58.529
Eli.

11:58.749 --> 11:59.129
Eli.

11:59.970 --> 12:00.371
Eli.

12:01.332 --> 12:02.854
Sure, that's... Eli.

12:02.974 --> 12:03.595
A Jew.

12:05.697 --> 12:06.158
That's right.

12:07.580 --> 12:13.367
They couldn't help between a Jew and a Syrian and any other goddamn thing.

12:13.387 --> 12:16.290
At that point in your life, certainly, you never would have expected that you would have...

12:17.300 --> 12:19.203
get involved in the performing arts.

12:19.223 --> 12:22.068
I never wanted to be in the theatre, not until I got in it.

12:22.088 --> 12:24.112
I didn't know what the hell I wanted to do, honestly.

12:25.093 --> 12:28.018
Nick, I didn't know what the hell I wanted to do.

12:28.038 --> 12:29.942
All I wanted was not to work in my father's store.

12:31.044 --> 12:34.389
Well that breaks with that, as you point out, that really breaks with tradition.

12:34.409 --> 12:38.997
Talk about the eldest son takes over the father's store.

12:39.017 --> 12:39.979
Takes it over.

12:40.179 --> 12:41.822
I love those pictures in the book where he's

12:42.022 --> 12:47.529
finally appreciating your clippings.

12:47.589 --> 12:50.092
You can write this fucking interview without talking to me.

12:50.733 --> 12:51.594
You know all about me.

12:52.275 --> 12:55.339
You were successful despite yourself is basically what he's thinking.

12:55.660 --> 12:58.644
He used to call me hopeless case.

12:59.004 --> 12:59.425
I love it.

13:00.105 --> 13:05.032
Oh, my father has a business and my brother became a lawyer and I'm a writer.

13:06.053 --> 13:07.455
You escaped.

13:08.212 --> 13:10.395
It's done wonderful things.

13:10.475 --> 13:14.542
It put us through college, it gave us a good living, but, you know, we wanted to do other things.

13:14.842 --> 13:16.585
And it's hard to pay tuition.

13:16.665 --> 13:22.093
It was $400 in those days, but after that, it was amazing everywhere.

13:22.694 --> 13:29.063
You mentioned also that it took a trip to your village to really appreciate the Ned, to begin to understand.

13:29.083 --> 13:30.686
I wonder if you could talk a little bit about that.

13:30.766 --> 13:36.835
Yeah, well, when I went back to where he came from, which was mid-Anatolia,

13:38.030 --> 13:42.235
I realized, I pictured him there and I realized how brave he was getting out of there.

13:44.397 --> 13:52.927
I realized how courageous that act was getting out of there and how lucky I was that he did it and how much I owe to him.

13:53.348 --> 13:54.489
It first occurred to me.

13:54.950 --> 14:00.076
He goes, now watch this beautiful creature ringing.

14:00.256 --> 14:04.100
He looks forward to this time of the day, as I call it tea time.

14:05.001 --> 14:05.522
I do.

14:06.802 --> 14:08.965
My wife and I just... Look what she brought you.

14:09.225 --> 14:10.026
I'm going to pass.

14:10.046 --> 14:11.868
We just had lunch at the oyster box.

14:12.028 --> 14:12.749
Oh, none of this.

14:12.789 --> 14:13.530
None of this.

14:13.550 --> 14:13.831
Can't do that.

14:13.851 --> 14:14.912
You're going to hurt our feelings.

14:15.032 --> 14:16.153
Thank you.

14:16.173 --> 14:18.216
A little mixed bag.

14:18.236 --> 14:18.817
He'll have a little.

14:19.017 --> 14:19.898
He's Greek.

14:21.119 --> 14:21.780
Thank you, Laura.

14:21.800 --> 14:22.361
Look at this.

14:23.582 --> 14:25.585
Are my friends Janice and Rana here today?

14:25.985 --> 14:26.786
They should be back.

14:26.826 --> 14:29.089
Rana has returned and Janice will be back.

14:29.109 --> 14:29.790
I'm going to say hello to you.

14:29.810 --> 14:30.050
Oh, sure.

14:30.351 --> 14:31.392
They would like to see you.

14:31.412 --> 14:32.353
Before I head back to...

14:33.194 --> 14:33.955
Massachusetts.

14:33.975 --> 14:36.658
Drove in this morning because I... You want to drive back out?

14:36.679 --> 14:37.039
Yeah.

14:37.059 --> 14:38.060
What's it take?

14:38.080 --> 14:38.741
You know what it takes?

14:38.761 --> 14:39.182
Six hours.

14:39.262 --> 14:42.626
It takes three hours to drive down and three hours to take the shuttle.

14:43.467 --> 14:44.849
I mean, I left my house in Grafton.

14:44.869 --> 14:46.151
You know where Nick Gage's house is?

14:46.171 --> 14:46.451
Thank you.

14:47.152 --> 14:48.053
Where Nick Gage's house is.

14:48.173 --> 14:52.159
I live from maybe 45 seconds away from his house.

14:52.179 --> 14:52.699
From Nick's house?

14:52.900 --> 14:53.440
From Nick's house.

14:53.460 --> 14:53.981
We're neighbors.

14:54.582 --> 14:55.423
Nick and I are neighbors.

14:55.443 --> 14:57.646
We're pretty friendly, I must say.

14:57.886 --> 14:58.447
We're pals.

14:59.208 --> 15:02.011
As much as we can be, I suppose.

15:02.031 --> 15:02.492
But, uh...

15:02.945 --> 15:04.687
It took me, I left my house this morning at 8.30.

15:04.987 --> 15:06.669
We were in New York at 1.25.

15:06.769 --> 15:08.211
I parked the car.

15:08.231 --> 15:08.892
My wife's with me.

15:08.912 --> 15:09.712
She's out shopping.

15:10.153 --> 15:13.156
We've got two little girls there in school today.

15:13.176 --> 15:13.857
And here we are.

15:13.877 --> 15:15.559
We'll be back home by 7 o'clock tonight.

15:16.220 --> 15:17.521
Who takes care of the girl?

15:17.541 --> 15:23.808
We're there in school, and we've got a babysitter coming up at 2 o'clock.

15:23.828 --> 15:27.212
I thought I'd take my wife to the town today to buy her lunch.

15:27.592 --> 15:28.473
You're a regular Greek.

15:29.314 --> 15:32.918
Got to be, you know, gave her a credit card and said, well, we'll buy some.

15:33.860 --> 16:02.922
some pretty clothes right i hope you've met her before you might remember her first let her bring her in she's right she didn't i wanted to bring her in you know but uh she's probably best doing she's right she's out shopping but we'll see her on the way home she read the book she was i just got this book a week ago so she's got it after i do she's grabbing at it but when i'm done she has it next to her

16:03.762 --> 16:06.184
I was impressed that you interviewed your parents on tape.

16:07.505 --> 16:12.049
I mean, you've been working three and a half years on the book, but I have a sense that you've been working on this book all your life.

16:13.951 --> 16:14.211
Right, right.

16:14.231 --> 16:19.135
I mean, when you interviewed your parents, and certainly asking them pertinent questions that... I'm a saver.

16:20.816 --> 16:23.559
You write me a letter, I save it.

16:23.799 --> 16:25.981
I make a note on you, I save it.

16:26.061 --> 16:30.044
I notice something, I hear a joke, and I think it's good, I save it, I save everything.

16:31.966 --> 16:33.567
I had a mountain of material for this book.

16:34.306 --> 16:47.303
That's very important, because one of the reviewers, was it Dr. Schlesinger, I wonder, who was so impressed by the detail that you remembered all these conversations.

16:47.883 --> 16:48.364
I told him.

16:48.404 --> 16:49.365
I met him at the party.

16:49.385 --> 16:51.208
I didn't remember all those conversations.

16:51.228 --> 16:54.512
I only remember what was important to me.

16:54.532 --> 16:57.736
I mean, beyond what I wrote down, I remember only what was important to me.

16:58.337 --> 17:00.139
I can't remember what I did yesterday.

17:00.159 --> 17:01.401
No, yesterday I can remember.

17:01.421 --> 17:02.322
Not the day before, though.

17:03.500 --> 17:04.161
Why is that?

17:04.221 --> 17:05.743
I don't know, I just don't remember.

17:05.763 --> 17:06.564
Unless it's important.

17:06.584 --> 17:08.887
I only remember something important.

17:08.907 --> 17:10.529
It makes an imprint.

17:10.549 --> 17:17.258
Well, now you mentioned that scene where you had this confrontation with the guy from Detroit.

17:17.459 --> 17:18.260
Yeah, I wrote that down.

17:18.820 --> 17:19.261
That night.

17:19.782 --> 17:21.203
You went back and wrote it down that night.

17:21.264 --> 17:23.166
Now here's something that happened 50 years ago.

17:24.948 --> 17:29.895
You saved it for 50 years for this, 50 odd years ago for this book.

17:31.192 --> 17:33.935
I wrote it down that night.

17:34.235 --> 17:35.336
That night.

17:35.376 --> 17:36.918
Not that night.

17:37.479 --> 17:38.500
Later that same night.

17:39.961 --> 17:41.102
I went home and wrote it.

17:41.142 --> 17:41.843
So I wouldn't forget it.

17:43.525 --> 17:43.925
It's amazing.

17:43.965 --> 17:45.547
That's why the detail is so fresh.

17:49.951 --> 17:52.074
Other stuff I forget.

17:52.094 --> 17:59.041
You say, you know, I have the sense also that, like the Greeks, you spit in the face of death.

17:59.101 --> 18:00.102
You defy it.

18:00.908 --> 18:04.752
Well, I'm reading your book.

18:04.972 --> 18:06.113
I mean, you're in this book.

18:06.674 --> 18:08.155
You are this book, you know.

18:08.215 --> 18:09.577
That's a good way to say it.

18:09.997 --> 18:12.239
I think I agree with that.

18:12.259 --> 18:13.461
The better or worse than him.

18:13.641 --> 18:14.542
Well, that's it.

18:16.083 --> 18:17.385
But do you fear it?

18:20.348 --> 18:23.411
78 years old, I'm good health.

18:23.431 --> 18:25.373
It looks spectacular, by the way.

18:27.595 --> 18:29.717
I've held the hands of a lot of people when they died.

18:30.423 --> 18:31.344
and I saw them die.

18:32.565 --> 18:37.390
And I know I've put in four of them, but there are a lot more.

18:37.410 --> 18:39.593
Five of them, I described Clifford's death, too.

18:39.613 --> 18:40.374
And there are a lot more.

18:42.796 --> 18:50.765
I'm fascinated, but I'm afraid of the truth, because I think what Harold Kuhlman said, how a man dies just tells a lot about how he lived.

18:50.785 --> 18:51.746
I'm not afraid of it, no.

18:53.448 --> 18:53.968
I'm not afraid.

18:54.088 --> 18:57.092
One thing that helps me a lot is the fact that my children love me.

18:57.112 --> 18:59.434
If my children had anything against me, I have five children.

18:59.853 --> 19:07.143
If they had things against me, I wouldn't be as happy as I am, or resolved, or at ease as I am.

19:07.163 --> 19:11.709
I've got a good wife now, cooks my dinner once in a while.

19:11.729 --> 19:12.891
That's a Greek thing, huh?

19:12.991 --> 19:14.453
Oh, I love that opening cry.

19:14.974 --> 19:23.205
This is my wife, I'm happy with her, but I wish the hell she'd stop asking me if I'm angry, you know?

19:25.068 --> 19:26.029
That's a cute song.

19:27.545 --> 19:29.768
I have to say, I collect.

19:29.788 --> 19:32.331
I'm a book collector, first edition.

19:32.351 --> 19:35.274
I'm going to ask you to describe this before.

19:35.294 --> 19:36.415
I'm glad to go later.

19:36.435 --> 19:36.916
It's a pleasure.

19:38.137 --> 19:50.091
Two of the authors I collect, Uliad Pizan, of course, but I also collect Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller, who I would have to say are the two great playwrights of our time.

19:50.192 --> 19:51.793
I mean, is that a fair assessment?

19:51.813 --> 19:54.457
It's not an obvious assessment, perhaps.

19:54.477 --> 19:55.678
You think I'm mean to Arthur Miller?

19:57.532 --> 19:58.794
No.

19:58.814 --> 19:59.735
Not on the whole.

19:59.755 --> 20:00.096
No.

20:00.116 --> 20:00.837
I'd flatter him, really.

20:00.857 --> 20:01.758
You'd flatter him.

20:01.799 --> 20:05.965
I mean... Tennessee Williams is, of course, a thousand hours of battery.

20:07.507 --> 20:13.376
And I was very moved by that letter that you wrote for delivery at his memorial service.

20:13.396 --> 20:19.506
I was going to ask you about, you know, as I was formulating this interview, reading the book, and then I came from that, I said, he's answered it right there.

20:19.526 --> 20:20.367
He's answered it.

20:22.330 --> 20:23.692
Be happy for what the man did.

20:23.732 --> 20:24.513
I mean, he's with us.

20:24.553 --> 20:25.615
His work is with us.

20:26.675 --> 20:29.839
Talk about how unhappy he was bullshit.

20:29.859 --> 20:33.605
He really... Well, he's lucky he died when he did.

20:33.645 --> 20:35.227
If he were alive today, he'd die of AIDS.

20:35.407 --> 20:37.150
That's my own personal opinion.

20:37.170 --> 20:37.510
He worked.

20:38.472 --> 20:47.184
I mean, that's said as a statement because of what you hear about the man's indiscriminate promiscuity.

20:47.204 --> 20:49.407
I mean, that's... This is off the record.

20:49.427 --> 20:52.151
I'm just saying this is not... I'm off the record, but I think, too.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.893
I mean, it's true, isn't it?

20:53.973 --> 20:56.597
I don't know, but that's my guess is that.

20:59.294 --> 21:06.944
But you worked with them, not only worked with them, but in the preparation of their greatest works.

21:09.867 --> 21:13.792
And I wonder if you could just give me a sense of the two playwrights.

21:13.812 --> 21:18.838
Just talk a little bit, maybe I can ask you a question.

21:18.858 --> 21:21.922
Well, like you said before, it's all in the book, but I will try it.

21:24.285 --> 21:26.668
Tennessee was more...

21:29.045 --> 21:36.232
Secret, more reserved, more imaginative, gentler, more compassionate.

21:37.874 --> 21:41.717
Compassion is an outstanding characteristic of his 20s.

21:42.898 --> 21:47.363
Arthur Miller was a great storyteller, but very definite by what he felt about everything.

21:48.984 --> 21:52.348
I think he wrote from a desire to make a statement.

21:53.268 --> 21:54.850
So when understood the human condition better?

21:55.893 --> 22:01.980
I respect Arthur.

22:02.120 --> 22:04.363
Arthur really stayed in the theater, for one thing.

22:04.383 --> 22:06.666
I didn't, I quit it.

22:06.686 --> 22:08.648
He always had something to say.

22:08.668 --> 22:09.809
His plays always had theme.

22:09.829 --> 22:12.412
You don't find that much in the movies and the plays today.

22:12.432 --> 22:13.914
They lack theme.

22:13.954 --> 22:21.563
They don't know what the hell made the author sit down and write him.

22:22.488 --> 22:27.493
Aside from everything else, I had great personal affection for one of them, and lost it for the other.

22:27.513 --> 22:30.376
I used to have, we were like brothers at one time.

22:31.377 --> 22:37.583
But the political thing, I didn't care about that.

22:37.623 --> 22:40.927
The guys that disagreed with that, that I did too.

22:41.928 --> 22:48.274
But in effect, what they said was, look, we didn't like what you did, but you're still our friend.

22:48.334 --> 22:51.077
John Steinbeck was that way.

22:52.070 --> 23:17.284
said the same thing they never changed where they stood they realized i have a right to my own viewpoint and very good but you also pointed out how erected clip was that that's one of the saddest parts that's true that that's a tragedy i mean as you described going out to visit him in california it's true it's too bad he couldn't hack it he couldn't help with him what you just said is true he couldn't hack it

23:18.023 --> 23:20.807
And it went on for years, I mean, what happened.

23:20.827 --> 23:25.054
And nobody can tell me, nobody knows what cancer comes from.

23:25.094 --> 23:27.477
There isn't a doctor in the world who knows anything about it.

23:28.118 --> 23:32.345
But I think it comes from a diminution of the body's will to resist.

23:32.926 --> 23:39.576
I mean, we all have this immune system in us that resists the disease germs that are in all of us.

23:40.079 --> 23:40.900
I don't know.

23:40.920 --> 23:41.982
This is not theoretical.

23:42.042 --> 23:42.463
I don't know.

23:42.483 --> 23:43.324
You know who also believes this?

23:43.344 --> 23:44.025
I'm not medical.

23:44.045 --> 23:44.346
You understand?

23:44.426 --> 23:45.548
But I want to tell you who does believe it.

23:45.568 --> 23:47.350
You know, Michael Crichton, who's a pharmacist?

23:47.411 --> 23:48.312
He believes it, too.

23:48.492 --> 23:48.973
He believes it.

23:49.594 --> 23:51.036
And he's a trained physician.

23:51.096 --> 23:52.679
I mean, they would practice and he'd bring it.

23:53.019 --> 23:53.761
That's what I believe.

23:53.981 --> 23:55.263
I've seen it so often.

23:55.303 --> 23:55.984
He said it.

23:56.024 --> 23:57.346
He absolutely believes it.

23:57.366 --> 24:00.331
You bring up these things.

24:00.351 --> 24:01.933
And I believe Tommy Thompson.

24:01.953 --> 24:02.855
Remember him, the writer?

24:02.915 --> 24:03.015
Sure.

24:03.416 --> 24:04.197
Wonderful guy.

24:04.615 --> 24:24.160
He firmly believed that Birch, remember, just don't ask me how we ended up discussing Birch Bayh, the senator, whose wife died of cancer, and Birch Bayh was considered one of the biggest swordsmen in Washington at the time, you know, and he believed that

24:25.017 --> 24:30.204
Perhaps his wife did this as a statement, as a desperation, subconsciously.

24:30.264 --> 24:31.085
Did he tell that to you?

24:31.105 --> 24:32.126
He did tell it to me.

24:32.146 --> 24:32.366
To you?

24:32.647 --> 24:33.488
To me.

24:33.508 --> 24:34.108
Private.

24:34.129 --> 24:34.769
Private.

24:34.789 --> 24:34.950
Private.

24:35.070 --> 24:35.971
Private on tape.

24:36.031 --> 24:36.632
I don't tell it.

24:36.652 --> 24:39.455
It's not that I would never use something confidential.

24:39.475 --> 24:40.677
I'd keep it to myself, but I don't tell it.

24:40.697 --> 24:40.877
Use it.

24:40.897 --> 24:41.898
The man's deceased.

24:41.998 --> 24:44.642
It's not privileged anymore.

24:44.702 --> 24:45.763
It's an act of revenge.

24:46.264 --> 24:47.345
He felt that way.

24:47.445 --> 24:52.712
And then Baye resigned from the Senate and he wrote this book, I almost think as a

24:53.654 --> 24:57.978
as a gesture to seek retribution, I mean, redemption.

24:58.559 --> 24:59.459
Redemption.

24:59.479 --> 25:00.480
Not retribution.

25:00.500 --> 25:03.203
Redemption, because he felt guilty.

25:03.223 --> 25:05.945
That sounds as good as anything else.

25:05.986 --> 25:07.207
I'm sorry to go off on this.

25:07.227 --> 25:16.415
I'm just validating what you said on that particular point.

25:16.435 --> 25:22.581
We did talk about your kids, and that's very important to me to have this story, the respect.

25:23.050 --> 25:24.433
of your kids and the approval.

25:24.493 --> 25:25.975
The approval of your children on this?

25:26.036 --> 25:26.757
What if you don't?

25:27.037 --> 25:28.520
Did your kids read this in manuscript?

25:28.781 --> 25:29.362
No, no, no.

25:29.442 --> 25:29.903
Yes, yes.

25:30.003 --> 25:30.624
No, wait a minute.

25:30.825 --> 25:31.446
Not manuscript.

25:31.486 --> 25:31.806
Galley.

25:32.107 --> 25:33.249
Wait a minute.

25:33.850 --> 25:37.617
Two of them read it in manuscript and three read it in found galleys.

25:37.637 --> 25:39.801
Well, let me just ask a hypothetical question.

25:39.822 --> 25:42.346
What if they objected to a lot of what you were doing?

25:42.587 --> 25:43.508
I would have felt terrible.

25:43.528 --> 25:44.350
That would have changed it.

25:47.738 --> 25:52.346
I imagine you tried to explain to them how important it is.

25:52.426 --> 25:58.517
I might have tried some, but this is a book where you either like the basic intention or you don't.

25:58.537 --> 25:59.018
I was lucky.

25:59.238 --> 26:00.360
I really was.

26:00.440 --> 26:03.486
I was also scared about my wife, my cousin wife, my third wife.

26:03.506 --> 26:07.613
She liked it, too.

26:07.773 --> 26:10.658
God has blessed you with the people who love you, apparently.

26:11.414 --> 26:13.337
They don't love me only.

26:13.517 --> 26:18.125
What they love is the fact that when they read the book, even a few pages, they realize the guy's leveling.

26:19.547 --> 26:20.228
Well, it's trust.

26:20.589 --> 26:20.729
What?

26:20.889 --> 26:22.392
It's trust as well, I think.

26:22.412 --> 26:28.161
They say the guy's telling the truth, and he's as tough on anyone else as he is, on himself, as he is on anyone else.

26:28.982 --> 26:31.987
Is it important to hear the last thing I said?

26:32.007 --> 26:34.672
I did, sir.

26:34.692 --> 26:36.154
That's the problem with tape recorders.

26:36.174 --> 26:38.097
You know, you're always thinking, instead of taking notes,

26:38.549 --> 26:39.832
No, no, no, no, it isn't that.

26:41.094 --> 26:45.784
It's important to me that you asked me how the hell you had a miracle, God blessed you and all that.

26:45.804 --> 26:49.953
The reason he blessed me was that I didn't fudge on anything.

26:50.153 --> 26:51.195
I tried to tell the truth.

26:51.215 --> 26:53.280
But I was going into a follow-up on that.

26:56.606 --> 26:58.330
On the need to tell so much truth.

26:58.512 --> 27:03.518
to be so confessional, to be so frank, to expose yourself, to make yourself naked.

27:03.758 --> 27:04.439
There are two things.

27:04.499 --> 27:06.662
One is to expose yourself, which I don't care about.

27:06.722 --> 27:07.163
I'm 78.

27:07.223 --> 27:09.345
I don't care what everybody thinks of it.

27:09.365 --> 27:10.847
But the need to tell it all.

27:10.887 --> 27:12.790
You can't go halfway with this.

27:12.810 --> 27:14.211
I don't think, I couldn't.

27:14.231 --> 27:18.617
I started to write the book once, wrote 60 pages, and threw it away.

27:20.499 --> 27:21.000
Why is that?

27:21.621 --> 27:25.726
Just then I did, then I did, then I did, then I did, and then I did, and then I did, and then I met.

27:25.746 --> 27:27.608
It's not worth the effort.

27:28.465 --> 27:29.846
So you weren't going all the way with us.

27:29.866 --> 27:34.371
So I waited a couple of years, and I waited another year, I waited about three years.

27:34.431 --> 27:36.113
I said, I better do it right.

27:38.696 --> 27:49.507
You also say frequently in the book that when you were acting, that one of the greatest charges I got, and this word is used a lot, a charge.

27:49.907 --> 27:55.553
The biggest charge I've ever had, and this is when you were acting, I won that particular role.

27:55.752 --> 27:58.335
You're saying that you need a charge out of what you're doing.

27:58.535 --> 28:00.397
You need to be energized.

28:00.417 --> 28:05.222
And I guess the converse of that is you must get bored pretty easily, too.

28:05.482 --> 28:10.288
I mean, is life a series of... I've never been bored in my life because I never have been bored.

28:10.308 --> 28:11.169
I've always done something.

28:11.309 --> 28:16.975
If I'm suddenly out of anything that interests me, I find something that is.

28:16.995 --> 28:18.176
I've never been bored in my life.

28:18.336 --> 28:23.582
But the charge thing, charge thing, looking for something that stirs me is critical and important.

28:24.203 --> 28:26.085
I have no leisure.

28:26.947 --> 28:27.507
It's a curse.

28:29.470 --> 28:31.673
I can't go fishing.

28:31.693 --> 28:32.414
It drives me nuts.

28:32.494 --> 28:34.516
Friends of mine say, let's go fishing now.

28:34.536 --> 28:40.063
They took me bone fishing in the Caribbean and I really like the scenery and I like the bone fish and everything.

28:40.083 --> 28:42.166
I hated to catch the cotton and bone fish.

28:42.186 --> 28:44.709
I threw them back in as soon as I could.

28:44.729 --> 28:45.831
I have no leisure in me.

28:45.851 --> 28:46.692
I can't play cards.

28:46.772 --> 28:47.713
You mean you can't relax?

28:48.054 --> 28:49.215
No, all I can do is I can read.

28:49.235 --> 28:50.256
I can read and write.

28:51.919 --> 28:53.080
Do you relax doing that?

28:53.819 --> 28:54.540
I want to relax.

28:54.560 --> 28:55.301
Why should I relax?

28:55.801 --> 28:56.702
I'll relax when I'm dead.

28:58.604 --> 29:01.647
So if you're gold fishing, what's going on?

29:02.128 --> 29:02.889
You say, what am I doing?

29:02.909 --> 29:03.910
I'm being a nice fellow.

29:04.050 --> 29:05.171
What would you rather be doing?

29:05.251 --> 29:05.552
Writing?

29:05.872 --> 29:06.493
I'd rather be home.

29:07.894 --> 29:09.476
That's what I'd do a couple of days later.

29:09.496 --> 29:10.156
I didn't go out.

29:10.217 --> 29:12.159
I'd just stay home and read or just thought.

29:12.839 --> 29:14.161
I don't mind having nothing to do.

29:14.761 --> 29:21.008
But you say you've never been bored, yet you reach the heights as an actor and you'll leave it.

29:21.393 --> 29:26.099
You're the hottest director on Broadway and you kiss it off.

29:26.780 --> 29:27.621
Not because I'm bored.

29:28.081 --> 29:28.842
Well why though?

29:28.882 --> 29:29.503
I want to move.

29:30.604 --> 29:32.547
Well I mean there must be an affinity.

29:32.587 --> 29:40.156
There must be a flying line between being bored or looking for the next kick, the next charge to use your word.

29:40.176 --> 29:42.819
Maybe there is.

29:42.839 --> 29:43.460
I don't know.

29:43.500 --> 29:44.481
I look back on it.

29:45.220 --> 29:47.322
When I was being an actor, I always wanted to be a director.

29:47.563 --> 29:50.766
When I was a stage director, I always wanted to be a screen director as well.

29:51.767 --> 29:53.029
There's a lot of as-wells in there.

29:53.089 --> 29:58.275
When I was a stage, a screen director, I always wanted to be a writer as well.

29:59.095 --> 29:59.816
I wanted everything.

29:59.856 --> 30:07.965
Some guys said that critically of me, that I see them on everything in life and so on and so on.

30:08.005 --> 30:09.727
Your friend Nick Cage is a little like that.

30:09.747 --> 30:10.808
He is a little like that.

30:10.869 --> 30:11.629
He's restless.

30:11.649 --> 30:13.572
He's nicer than me, but he's a little like that.

30:13.592 --> 30:14.873
He's restless.

30:15.325 --> 30:43.662
he wants it all yeah and and like he had a week's vacation with his family down the cape and i mean and he had a wonderful time but i could i sense that the guy you know where is he now he's got an office in a house i think he's in california he's in new york i talked to him in new york last friday yeah i told him i was coming down to see you what did he say i said you know tell him i love the book but you know he wrote the blurb and uh i i just asked him he liked the book it was a lot like him

30:44.418 --> 30:47.663
In fact, he had told me a few things about it.

30:47.683 --> 30:51.410
I remember coming across a few things that sounded familiar.

30:51.430 --> 31:04.973
I remember he had told me that one scene where you gave the director, this guy that was with this woman, and you told him what room you would be staying in, knowing implicitly that the woman was going to show up.

31:05.854 --> 31:07.817
That was the old days.

31:07.837 --> 31:08.198
It's all over now.

31:08.583 --> 31:09.204
this as well.

31:09.424 --> 31:10.104
It was vengeful.

31:10.205 --> 31:11.406
I don't have a vengeful feeling.

31:11.426 --> 31:12.467
That's the question here.

31:12.507 --> 31:14.068
You say, I am not a forgiving man.

31:14.108 --> 31:14.809
Has that changed?

31:14.829 --> 31:15.409
No.

31:15.950 --> 31:17.892
I'm not a forgiving man, but not in that way.

31:17.912 --> 31:19.533
I'm not vengeful.

31:19.613 --> 31:28.081
You really went after that guy to kick that guy in the nuts maybe a little bit.

31:28.121 --> 31:30.844
Not him, but his type.

31:30.864 --> 31:32.205
His eminence.

31:32.285 --> 31:35.248
The officers in the army I knew.

31:35.802 --> 31:38.085
Yeah, dig the trench, do this run here.

31:38.346 --> 31:45.456
You know, all that kind of shit that I had to go through.

31:45.496 --> 31:48.981
I don't exercise vengeance now, but I do have vengeful feelings.

31:49.082 --> 31:50.063
I don't have them anymore.

31:50.083 --> 31:50.824
I put them in a book.

31:51.285 --> 31:52.447
What do you think I wrote the book for?

31:52.487 --> 31:54.449
I got it off.

31:55.771 --> 31:58.215
I relieve myself, as they say, of a lot of stuff in it.

31:58.516 --> 32:00.758
You've written six books, seven books?

32:00.818 --> 32:01.919
Novels, they're different.

32:01.939 --> 32:02.360
Oh, I know.

32:02.400 --> 32:03.441
I've read a couple of them.

32:03.461 --> 32:06.384
I mean, I read the Anatolian and I read... The Anatolian's good.

32:06.404 --> 32:07.184
That's the best book I've read.

32:07.265 --> 32:07.665
That was good.

32:07.685 --> 32:08.766
We've talked about that.

32:08.906 --> 32:09.547
Yeah.

32:09.887 --> 32:12.009
And that's because there was a lot of you in that.

32:12.189 --> 32:14.632
Yeah, it's my favorite book of a novel.

32:14.712 --> 32:17.154
I mean, it doesn't compare with what I put in this book.

32:17.234 --> 32:19.436
So what do you do next after this?

32:19.597 --> 32:21.518
Well, I've written another novel.

32:22.499 --> 32:25.182
I wrote it four or five years ago.

32:26.275 --> 32:27.777
It needed revision.

32:27.817 --> 32:28.538
I may revise it.

32:28.918 --> 32:30.220
I may make a film of it.

32:30.280 --> 32:32.022
I'll do something.

32:32.043 --> 32:33.424
Right now I'm going to take it easy a while.

32:35.187 --> 32:36.188
But you're not going to relax.

32:36.568 --> 32:38.351
No leisure time.

32:38.371 --> 32:39.532
See what happens.

32:39.552 --> 32:45.100
I'm much more able to take leisure time now, Nick, because I haven't got something driving me here.

32:45.120 --> 32:48.664
Write that book I'm talking about.

32:48.704 --> 32:49.385
You like the cover?

32:49.806 --> 32:50.807
I love it.

32:50.867 --> 32:51.608
It's beautiful, isn't it?

32:52.060 --> 32:57.265
I love the whole book, and I just love the way they've incorporated the photographs into the text.

32:57.766 --> 33:00.088
It was my idea, but they did it in a way that made it work.

33:00.448 --> 33:00.589
Yeah.

33:01.009 --> 33:01.870
This is a good company.

33:02.170 --> 33:02.951
This is the best.

33:03.151 --> 33:05.013
This is the Tiffany book publisher.

33:05.033 --> 33:06.154
They're a real good company.

33:06.174 --> 33:06.915
Yeah, they're wonderful.

33:07.035 --> 33:07.976
They cared a lot.

33:07.996 --> 33:09.397
They gave a shit, you know.

33:09.497 --> 33:11.640
I didn't find one type of one there.

33:11.680 --> 33:13.882
I mean, and this is an 859 page book.

33:13.902 --> 33:14.462
They gave a lot.

33:14.482 --> 33:15.223
They gave a lot.

33:15.443 --> 33:16.845
They care a lot.

33:16.865 --> 33:19.047
They gave a lot of time and attention.

33:20.444 --> 33:24.150
It was thrilling to me, really, to be able to, because I admire them so much.

33:24.170 --> 33:25.832
Yeah, they're wonderful.

33:25.852 --> 33:27.455
The last book was with this house, too.

33:28.176 --> 33:28.997
Yeah.

33:29.017 --> 33:30.420
As I recall.

33:30.440 --> 33:32.964
That's the Unsold, I remember.

33:33.064 --> 33:34.185
Yeah, they did.

33:34.206 --> 33:39.995
I can't believe it when you say, I am a mediocre director except when a player or film touches a part of my life experience.

33:40.015 --> 33:40.656
God's truth makes it true.

33:40.676 --> 33:41.537
Come on now.

33:41.978 --> 33:43.460
Isn't that a little self-effacing?

33:44.281 --> 33:44.341
No.

33:44.361 --> 33:44.982
It's the truth.

33:45.002 --> 33:45.964
God's truth.

33:45.984 --> 33:47.386
It's the opposite of self-effacing.

33:47.406 --> 33:47.987
It's posting.

33:48.423 --> 33:51.187
I have so much integrity that I can only do one kind of thing.

33:51.207 --> 33:51.688
It's posting.

33:52.108 --> 33:55.053
In a funny kind of way, it's posting.

33:55.073 --> 33:57.817
I can only do a play if it in some way touches me.

33:57.837 --> 33:58.338
I can't do it.

33:58.358 --> 33:59.199
I was at Lincoln Center.

33:59.219 --> 34:00.160
What can I do there?

34:00.180 --> 34:00.461
Nothing.

34:01.062 --> 34:01.683
I did shit.

34:02.464 --> 34:03.826
My workday was terrible.

34:03.846 --> 34:05.929
I deserve to fail there.

34:05.949 --> 34:08.413
I can't do classics.

34:08.493 --> 34:09.654
I can't do high comedy.

34:10.015 --> 34:15.102
I have a sense of humor, I suppose, but I can't do musical comedies.

34:16.004 --> 34:18.227
You start thinking of what I can't do, it's mostly theater.

34:18.680 --> 34:20.082
You understand now?

34:20.102 --> 34:20.582
A little better?

34:21.804 --> 34:23.686
That shit, I'm telling you the truth.

34:23.706 --> 34:25.869
And the fact that every time I tell the truth, I feel better.

34:26.049 --> 34:29.473
I'm relieved of that, why should I pretend I can do what I can't do?

34:30.314 --> 34:31.455
You end the book like that.

34:31.515 --> 34:35.540
It's almost, to go back to a Greek concept, it's almost a catharsis.

34:35.800 --> 34:35.941
Yeah.

34:36.581 --> 34:41.928
You really have purged your soul, so to speak, of this weight, of this burden.

34:41.968 --> 34:43.670
Three and a half pounds of stuff there did it.

34:44.851 --> 34:45.632
I am purged.

34:45.916 --> 34:52.808
And then just the way you conclude the book, it's a relief for you.

34:52.828 --> 34:54.330
I mean, this is it.

34:54.992 --> 34:57.255
Here I am, and I told you this story.

34:58.197 --> 34:59.760
Did you have any idea it was going to be this long?

35:00.421 --> 35:02.685
And it's mesmerizing.

35:02.705 --> 35:03.767
I mean, you cannot skim this.

35:03.887 --> 35:05.970
I cannot skim this book.

35:05.990 --> 35:09.436
Oh, no, but it began to appear that it would be very long, and I tried to cut.

35:09.476 --> 35:10.438
I guess I cut 150.

35:11.077 --> 35:13.399
Maybe a little more than a hundred pages out of it.

35:13.419 --> 35:17.783
I thought once, two hundred, but I think it's about a hundred and a quarter pages.

35:17.803 --> 35:19.084
I cut out some good stuff, too.

35:20.505 --> 35:28.813
I've got to go back to the directing because, okay, so if it touches your life experience, you mean there's nothing in Hamlet that could touch?

35:30.594 --> 35:32.536
Doesn't Shakespeare speak for all time?

35:32.636 --> 35:33.537
Yeah, he could, I guess.

35:33.637 --> 35:39.042
I mean, you pick the play that does touch me because it's about father and son, about revenge for your father and son.

35:39.511 --> 35:41.194
loving your father after he died.

35:41.935 --> 35:42.937
You pick the one, maybe.

35:43.838 --> 35:48.185
But I got offered a lot of Shakespeare plays to do, and I wouldn't know how to start.

35:48.225 --> 35:49.888
And I did one Elizabeth play.

35:50.068 --> 35:50.349
It was awful.

35:51.410 --> 35:51.771
Which one?

35:51.791 --> 35:58.662
The play I did, Lincoln Center.

35:58.682 --> 35:59.724
It was terrible.

35:59.744 --> 36:00.145
That's all.

36:01.086 --> 36:02.689
And then you say you're not an intellectual.

36:02.709 --> 36:04.692
You are not an intellectual on here.

36:04.975 --> 36:07.697
You consider yourself intellectual?

36:08.298 --> 36:08.718
Bullshit.

36:08.738 --> 36:09.299
I read a lot.

36:09.479 --> 36:10.480
Yeah, I read a lot, too.

36:10.520 --> 36:11.481
I'm not intellectual.

36:11.501 --> 36:13.302
I mean, I don't like intellectuals much.

36:13.322 --> 36:13.983
I mean, we're human beings.

36:14.023 --> 36:15.004
What is an intellectual?

36:15.604 --> 36:17.426
A guy that makes books out of other people's books.

36:18.067 --> 36:19.408
You say, what I need, I steal.

36:19.648 --> 36:23.171
I'm quoting you, Leah Kazan, right?

36:23.191 --> 36:25.453
A guy that makes books out of other people's books.

36:25.473 --> 36:26.574
That's what intellectuals do.

36:26.594 --> 36:28.996
They sit around, they read, and they make another book out of it.

36:29.176 --> 36:32.820
Do you want me to take a couple of shots here while we talk?

36:33.020 --> 36:33.160
No, no.

36:34.574 --> 36:37.937
Let me ask you another question so you can be talking.

36:38.798 --> 36:40.640
You say acting is a sexual act.

36:40.900 --> 36:42.021
It is, yeah.

36:42.041 --> 36:42.982
What do you mean by that?

36:43.002 --> 36:54.194
Well, in the sense that the fellow gets up there and he's asking for people to admire him and look up to him and impress with him and so on.

36:54.494 --> 36:56.936
In that sense, the sexual act.

36:56.956 --> 36:57.977
You get enough light?

36:57.997 --> 37:00.460
Yeah, this is very fast film.

37:00.480 --> 37:01.541
It's a wonderful little camera.

37:01.561 --> 37:02.982
It's amazing how everything has been made.

37:03.042 --> 37:03.743
What is that?

37:03.763 --> 37:04.564
It's an olympus.

37:05.270 --> 37:07.773
Is that the one that you don't have to load?

37:07.793 --> 37:08.173
No, I load it.

37:08.234 --> 37:08.594
It's .35.

37:08.614 --> 37:11.377
In fact, it's kind of flashy, which I don't even need.

37:11.397 --> 37:12.879
There's a flash in it, isn't there, too?

37:12.899 --> 37:14.261
There is, but I'm not using it.

37:14.281 --> 37:15.903
I'm shooting it all the way up.

37:15.923 --> 37:16.844
I don't like flash.

37:17.925 --> 37:18.305
I hate flash.

37:18.326 --> 37:19.247
How about as a director?

37:19.267 --> 37:22.130
Did you like a lot of light, or do you like that natural light?

37:22.731 --> 37:24.853
I like the streets.

37:26.575 --> 37:27.957
Real sets.

37:28.017 --> 37:32.222
I love the creation of every...

37:33.367 --> 37:36.451
to be a play or a movie, to me, is fascinating.

37:38.154 --> 37:39.496
On the waterfront.

37:39.516 --> 37:40.938
That was good, my description of that.

37:41.398 --> 37:41.999
Sad, wasn't it?

37:42.019 --> 37:43.221
That's a tour de force.

37:43.241 --> 37:44.863
Yeah, that description's very good.

37:44.963 --> 37:47.447
It really is.

37:47.467 --> 37:49.730
That's a lot of you in that, obviously.

37:49.790 --> 37:51.212
Again, it's your own experience.

37:51.973 --> 38:01.086
I guess it touches you, I guess I'm trying to get you to give me some quotes of that in the book.

38:01.106 --> 38:02.428
You know what's good at the end?

38:02.695 --> 38:09.363
about the play I did with Pinter and Spiegel and my mother dying at the same time.

38:09.563 --> 38:11.065
I always liked that chapter.

38:11.085 --> 38:13.287
It's terrible.

38:13.868 --> 38:23.279
You do talk at some length in the book about the differences between directing for the stage and film.

38:23.799 --> 38:28.585
Any one which you think is most demanding?

38:29.020 --> 38:31.803
It depends how hard you try.

38:32.164 --> 38:39.553
If you want to go all the way, like I did in this book or something, it would take you two years to do a good movie.

38:39.573 --> 38:41.495
Write it, cast it, and so on.

38:41.856 --> 38:43.738
It depends how much you want.

38:44.079 --> 38:45.721
Everything is as good as you try hard.

38:45.741 --> 38:47.383
If you try hard, it takes all that time.

38:48.624 --> 38:50.066
You can skip through everything.

38:50.086 --> 38:53.070
You know, in life, I'm talking about me, I don't know.

38:53.090 --> 38:57.475
Listen, I hate generalizations, but I don't like to tell you or anybody

38:58.400 --> 39:02.545
or you or anybody, generalize that, which is harder and all that stuff.

39:02.565 --> 39:04.007
That's for textbooks.

39:04.688 --> 39:08.052
They can be made hard or they can be made easy.

39:08.072 --> 39:13.879
One movie I did was easier than the rest, called Sprinter in the Grass, for some reason.

39:13.899 --> 39:14.820
That's a nice movie.

39:14.840 --> 39:14.960
Huh?

39:14.980 --> 39:16.241
That's a nice movie.

39:16.261 --> 39:18.824
The beautiful thing about movies, too, is that they last.

39:19.225 --> 39:24.231
But I worked a long time getting that ready, and they worked a hell of a long time getting that ready.

39:24.251 --> 39:26.854
But that went more easily than the others.

39:27.880 --> 39:28.901
I had good actors in it.

39:29.783 --> 39:33.448
I also wrote the screenplay, so that's not known generally, but don't say that.

39:33.468 --> 39:35.551
I don't want to take away from Amy.

39:35.571 --> 39:36.652
He wrote the screenplay?

39:36.672 --> 39:39.356
Yeah, he got the Academy Award, but I put it together.

39:39.376 --> 39:40.378
Did that annoy you?

39:40.398 --> 39:40.478
Hmm?

39:40.558 --> 39:43.863
Does that annoy you a little bit?

39:43.883 --> 39:44.423
No, he deserved it.

39:44.443 --> 39:45.104
He wrote the story.

39:46.106 --> 39:49.010
Well, why should he give the screenplay?

39:49.250 --> 39:50.953
I mean, why should he give the Academy Award?

39:51.013 --> 39:52.555
Listen, I had enough credit.

39:52.575 --> 39:53.156
It's like now.

39:53.176 --> 39:54.858
It doesn't matter.

39:54.878 --> 39:55.439
It doesn't matter.

39:55.499 --> 39:55.960
Don't worry about it.

39:55.980 --> 39:56.841
I'm not going to use that.

39:57.412 --> 40:04.679
We're going to turn it around so they can hear.

40:05.300 --> 40:06.381
Okay?

40:06.601 --> 40:06.721
Yep.

40:06.741 --> 40:08.623
It's a nice little camera.

40:08.643 --> 40:09.084
It's good.

40:09.204 --> 40:09.604
It's better.

40:09.624 --> 40:11.566
And this little machine is the best thing.

40:11.586 --> 40:12.207
What kind is that?

40:12.227 --> 40:13.668
It's a Sony.

40:14.029 --> 40:16.311
I mean, when I first got one, they were that big.

40:16.331 --> 40:17.192
Then they were that big.

40:17.232 --> 40:19.915
And now they're down to these microphones.

40:19.935 --> 40:21.717
And the sound is better.

40:22.097 --> 40:23.538
Is that that clever?

40:23.598 --> 40:24.139
Japanese.

40:25.060 --> 40:25.140
Hmm?

40:25.981 --> 40:27.603
Why can't the Greeks make these things?

40:27.663 --> 40:28.624
They didn't win the war.

40:28.664 --> 40:29.966
That's why the Japanese won the war.

40:29.986 --> 40:30.867
They did win the war.

40:31.708 --> 40:37.055
You mentioned in the book, you describe yourself politically for the record, a little left of center.

40:37.355 --> 40:40.659
You think Ronnie's done nice things for the... Who?

40:40.679 --> 40:41.280
Ronnie Reagan.

40:41.300 --> 40:44.044
You say he's done nice things for the inflation, but you'd never vote for him.

40:46.707 --> 40:47.668
What he did was...

40:47.868 --> 40:52.275
If I have some money in the bank, it's not much less than it used to be.

40:52.295 --> 40:55.179
My brother keeps saying to me, your money's leaking, your money's leaking.

40:55.459 --> 41:03.912
You say often that you long for chaos, and that on the other hand, you're such an orderly man.

41:03.932 --> 41:08.278
I don't know many people who have kept notes of all these conversations and details.

41:08.338 --> 41:10.922
That's a contradiction.

41:11.443 --> 41:13.526
At least, ostensibly, it's a big contradiction.

41:13.546 --> 41:15.429
But actually, I like both.

41:15.449 --> 41:16.170
I like order.

41:16.505 --> 41:18.788
My room where I write is very orderly.

41:18.828 --> 41:20.290
Everything has a place and so on.

41:20.711 --> 41:32.267
At the same time, a 9 to 5 job and going out to dinner and dinner at 7 and bed by 10 every night is hard to take.

41:32.288 --> 41:34.691
I mean, other people may like it.

41:34.791 --> 41:37.495
I don't put them down, but it's hard to take.

41:37.555 --> 41:38.617
I like surprises.

41:38.637 --> 41:40.820
I meet people that challenge me and so on.

41:41.881 --> 41:42.462
Traveling.

41:43.302 --> 41:47.227
I like it when I don't know what I'm doing.

41:47.287 --> 41:50.552
I think order is on a very rudimentary level.

41:50.572 --> 41:54.257
Chaos is perhaps on the cosmic level.

41:54.277 --> 41:55.759
I think you got a point.

41:55.819 --> 41:57.381
It's philosophic and cosmic.

41:57.401 --> 41:59.163
Yeah, again, it's getting a charge.

41:59.183 --> 42:03.870
It's not getting a charge out of the... I see your article's going to be called Getting a Charge.

42:04.250 --> 42:05.071
No, no, no.

42:05.452 --> 42:06.373
That's not a bad title.

42:06.473 --> 42:08.015
It's not bad.

42:09.437 --> 42:10.018
Let's see.

42:11.956 --> 42:13.938
It has been an eventful life, though, for you.

42:13.958 --> 42:15.981
I don't think so.

42:16.001 --> 42:17.122
Yes, we love.

42:17.803 --> 42:20.366
And the amazing thing is, I'm going to change this.

42:20.386 --> 42:21.627
You know what the amazing thing is?

42:21.707 --> 42:23.810
I'm still in good health.

42:23.930 --> 42:24.410
God bless.

42:26.473 --> 42:27.334
Are you a religious man?

42:29.456 --> 42:31.979
I don't like the religious man.

42:31.999 --> 42:33.341
Antipathy, too.

42:33.361 --> 42:35.443
How about the Greek background?

42:35.543 --> 42:38.246
Does any of that superstition stuff ever come in?

42:38.266 --> 42:41.490
Superstition, no, but they don't.

42:42.280 --> 42:48.890
the art and the philosophy and the sort of a large view.

42:48.910 --> 42:52.655
I really admire that.

42:53.376 --> 43:04.592
One of the big experiences I had from the point of view tradition was sailing in a boat around the islands, the Greek islands, stopping here and stopping there and seeing the people the way they were.

43:04.612 --> 43:06.295
And it was beautiful there.

43:06.315 --> 43:07.797
But I like everywhere then.

43:07.817 --> 43:09.379
I like Turkey too.

43:09.399 --> 43:10.701
You mentioned at the end

43:11.407 --> 43:13.109
There are so many things you'd like to do.

43:13.529 --> 43:16.993
I'd love to own a home in Greece, but it's never going to happen, you know.

43:18.014 --> 43:19.035
I almost did twice.

43:20.656 --> 43:21.497
I almost did twice.

43:21.517 --> 43:32.328
Is there a sense of going full circle or kind of going back to your... When I go back to Athens, I walk around, hear the language, but also a little bit of that happens when I go back to Turkey.

43:32.348 --> 43:39.355
When I go to Haji Baba's restaurant, which is his father who went to Haji Hodge,

43:40.381 --> 43:46.976
I see my father there walking around.

43:46.996 --> 43:52.990
I've got a very complex background, don't you think?
