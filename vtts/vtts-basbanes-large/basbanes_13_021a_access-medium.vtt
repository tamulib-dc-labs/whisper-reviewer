WEBVTT

00:02.731 --> 00:05.736
Well, thank you so much, Sam, for your wonderful introduction.

00:06.597 --> 00:10.543
And thank you, Charles, for your great welcoming remarks.

00:10.684 --> 00:14.049
And I want to thank Pat for her hospitality.

00:14.069 --> 00:30.375
And I want to thank the entire UTEP community for inviting me to join with you in this wonderful event, an event that not only celebrates books, but celebrates the book as an artifact.

00:30.929 --> 00:37.679
We have with us two remarkable young women who will be this year's Carl Herzog honor recipients.

00:38.280 --> 00:39.582
It's really a great pleasure to meet them.

00:39.602 --> 00:46.672
And I have to say that the Whistler book, I'm originally from Lowell, Massachusetts, where James McNeil Whistler was born.

00:46.712 --> 00:49.536
So there's always some connection, isn't there?

00:49.797 --> 00:54.784
We mentioned Whistler, Massachusetts, and your father lives in Massachusetts.

00:55.045 --> 01:00.092
So there's always these little connections that we make when we travel far afield.

01:00.933 --> 01:06.499
I'm just so impressed by the fact that I've come to Shangri-La on the border.

01:06.619 --> 01:15.630
I have to say, when Sam drove me up the hill yesterday and I saw these remarkable buildings in this architecture, I first thought, wow, this is southwestern architecture.

01:15.670 --> 01:17.572
And then I said, wait a minute, maybe it's Asian.

01:17.632 --> 01:19.814
And then, of course, then it's Butanese.

01:19.914 --> 01:27.463
And now I find that you are quite correctly anointed as Shangri-La at the border.

01:28.912 --> 01:30.635
Wonderful phrase.

01:30.795 --> 01:33.199
Well, I tell you, I look up here and say, still my heart.

01:33.279 --> 01:48.443
To see the dust jacket of a book that you work on for 10 years, all of a sudden, you know, 15 feet, however, it's quite an exciting experience, I have to say.

01:48.564 --> 01:52.290
Even after all these years, we're now entering the fifth year of publication.

01:52.390 --> 01:55.695
As Sam mentioned, the book was published in 1995.

01:56.232 --> 02:07.187
We've had seven editions, six in hardcover, and each one is a, this is a book arts gathering, so we do appreciate, I guess, the niceties between printings and editions.

02:08.669 --> 02:21.826
I'm a person who believes that a book like mine, which is a nonfiction work, which deals with living people as well as deceased people, can't help but to be a work in progress.

02:22.427 --> 02:24.450
And you say, how is that possible, a book that's

02:25.088 --> 02:32.838
published and produced and designed and issued between hard covers, how can a completed work be a work in progress?

02:32.858 --> 02:35.722
Well, I guess that kind of brings us to the title of the lecture today.

02:35.742 --> 02:38.045
Actually, I prefer to call it a talk.

02:38.065 --> 02:42.210
I think a lecture is a little too pedantic for a person of my temperament.

02:44.012 --> 02:48.218
I'm much more comfortable talking with you and having a conversation with you.

02:48.879 --> 02:53.745
But Among the Gently Mad, of course, is a play on the title of A Gentle Madness.

02:54.502 --> 02:56.845
And it is a continuing work in my view.

02:58.247 --> 03:09.763
Those of you who have had an opportunity to read the preface to the paperback, you'll note that I have had an opportunity to bring up to date at least five of the major stories in there.

03:11.045 --> 03:20.138
The great collector of modern first editions, Carter Burton, died in February of 1996 and his collection went to the Morgan Library.

03:20.590 --> 03:27.818
Then we had a famous chef from Chicago, Chef Louis Zafmari, when he passed away, also in 1996.

03:29.339 --> 03:41.772
He saw to it that his 250,000 books and perhaps a million culinary objects went to a variety of institutions to help them support museums and libraries and scholarship.

03:42.553 --> 03:48.960
And so there was another collector who had a transition, which I felt obligated to report

03:49.396 --> 03:51.358
on and to my readers.

03:52.639 --> 04:02.970
And then we also have the passing on of Dr. Haskell Norman, who is arguably the greatest collector of science books and medical books, again also in 1996.

04:03.050 --> 04:13.761
It really was a threesome of three extraordinary collectors who in each, in his own way, contributed to the cycle of books and collecting.

04:14.121 --> 04:18.846
The subtext of A Gentle Madness, it's wonderful to have a title

04:19.231 --> 04:21.835
that incorporates and embraces the word madness.

04:21.915 --> 04:32.231
I think that's one of the things that has really resonated with readers when you're talking about emotion and human nature and passion and obsession, of course.

04:32.251 --> 04:35.556
It was an inspiration, I have to say, when I came up with the title of Gentle Madness.

04:35.616 --> 04:43.628
And when I heard Sam say the new title of the new book is Lions at the Gate, then I whispered to myself, well, for now it is.

04:43.908 --> 04:44.950
It could change.

04:45.571 --> 04:47.213
And that is maybe the 10th or 12th

04:47.615 --> 04:48.957
different title that I've had.

04:49.017 --> 04:53.124
It's really been much tougher to come up with a title for this new book.

04:54.085 --> 05:01.036
I like the image of Lyons, who are the guardians of libraries, historically, traditionally, going back hundreds of years.

05:02.238 --> 05:05.183
And I'll tell you, this is a plea, this is a request.

05:05.704 --> 05:10.872
I've made requests to the queries to the Morgan Library in New York with their Lyons outside.

05:11.510 --> 05:17.637
to the New York Public Library where there are lions outside, to the Boston Public Library where there are wonderful lions inside.

05:18.578 --> 05:21.001
The Art Institute of Chicago, I believe, has lions.

05:21.041 --> 05:22.623
The British Museum has lions.

05:23.084 --> 05:25.466
Nobody can tell me where this tradition started.

05:25.607 --> 05:30.212
I mean, I've asked the head librarians, the Charles Pierce at the Morgan Library.

05:30.232 --> 05:31.493
You know, that's a good question, they say.

05:31.513 --> 05:31.994
We don't know.

05:32.535 --> 05:33.296
Well, I'm still looking.

05:33.456 --> 05:37.460
But I like the idea of the lion as the guardian of the library, the guardian of the book.

05:38.582 --> 05:40.504
And if you think about it, the lion, of course,

05:40.822 --> 05:43.746
facing outward is protecting the library.

05:43.786 --> 05:47.811
But if you turn them around, then I guess the image can almost be a predator.

05:48.893 --> 05:52.397
And the book is under attack in many quarters.

05:53.479 --> 05:54.700
We have suggestions.

05:54.840 --> 05:58.946
There will be a chapter in my new book, which I call The Once and Future Library.

06:00.087 --> 06:08.398
And it's a case study examination of the San Francisco Public Library situation, which many of you may have read about in the New Yorker magazine with Nicholson Baker.

06:08.902 --> 06:17.297
I spent two weeks out there attempting to get every little nuance and every little detail on just what happened there.

06:17.998 --> 06:33.846
What was this calculus that was put into play that actually persuaded these people that they could build a library without books, that they could actually build a place that was quite beautiful, have an atrium with wonderful sound

06:34.265 --> 06:35.327
acoustics in there.

06:35.347 --> 06:37.510
If you can believe it, a reading room is supposed to be quiet.

06:37.530 --> 06:38.872
You can hear pin drops in there.

06:40.254 --> 06:45.642
You can have string quartets play in there, but you really don't have much room for people to sit down and read.

06:45.682 --> 06:53.233
And then you wonder what kind of books they're going to read because they sent 500,000 books off to a landfill without even documenting what books that they were.

06:54.495 --> 07:02.247
And now, just within the last six weeks, the people of San Francisco have had a post-occupancy evaluation

07:02.885 --> 07:11.775
which reports that it will take $30 million to now repair this state-of-the-art future library and to make it a real legitimate library.

07:11.795 --> 07:20.464
Well, it's a very interesting case study, and I know that you've had some concerns here in El Paso, and I certainly don't mean to be making any comparisons.

07:20.764 --> 07:31.896
I think we all have to deal with our own library situations, but I think that there is a cautionary tale there that you should all be alert to and you should study and pay attention to.

07:32.686 --> 07:34.208
Well, I guess I'm jumping ahead of myself.

07:34.268 --> 07:38.293
I usually talk about the new book towards the end of the talk.

07:38.313 --> 07:41.897
But among the gently mad, who are the gently mad?

07:41.917 --> 07:45.761
I guess all of us who love books have a touch of the gentle madness.

07:48.364 --> 07:51.168
Sam mentioned that I am from Massachusetts.

07:51.228 --> 07:57.495
I spent my professional life working in Worcester, much of it, as a book review editor, 13 years.

07:58.235 --> 08:03.360
than as an independent scholar and a writer and a historian of books and book culture.

08:04.721 --> 08:13.170
And very early on, I did an essay for a Boston magazine, and the subject of this essay was 1200 years of collecting in Boston.

08:13.190 --> 08:14.991
Now you wonder how that is possible.

08:15.992 --> 08:19.396
You know, Boston, we've only been here for 300 years or so.

08:20.257 --> 08:27.904
But if you look at 350 years at Harvard, and if you look at 200 years at the Massachusetts Historical Society, and 200 years at

08:28.475 --> 08:33.480
the American Antiquarian Society, and you go on and on, and the math adds up to about 1,200 years.

08:33.520 --> 08:47.054
And what I did was write a kind of a narrative history of all of these institutions, and not just the collection and the gathering of the books, but the kind of passion and obsession that went into building these collections.

08:47.074 --> 08:57.385
And it dawned on me at one really almost epiphanous moment that it is really the passion, the obsession,

08:57.652 --> 09:16.418
of the quirky eccentric collector who is responsible for preserving so much of what we know of our literature, our culture, our history, and that without the efforts of these determined, driven individuals, so much of what we know of ourselves and value of ourselves would be lost forever.

09:17.780 --> 09:24.790
So I wrote this piece, and it was published in 1988, I guess it was, and had a very nice response.

09:25.748 --> 09:33.956
And my wife, God bless her, I remember, prior to the publication of this piece, I like to read to her what I write aloud.

09:34.937 --> 09:39.661
I get a good feeling for the rhythms and the nuances and the organization.

09:40.662 --> 09:44.005
And I remember reading this opening paragraph for her.

09:44.085 --> 09:52.093
I started at Harvard University on the second floor of the Houghton Library, and with the death mask of John Keats,

09:52.394 --> 09:58.662
in the Amy Lowell room, and then I moved across the Charles River and up to Beacon Hill to the Boston Athenaeum.

09:59.903 --> 10:02.667
And she said, you know, there's your book.

10:02.687 --> 10:04.148
You know, the light flashes over you.

10:04.329 --> 10:07.212
This could be the book that you were born to write.

10:07.232 --> 10:08.233
Excuse me just a second here.

10:14.421 --> 10:21.169
And so began this quixotic

10:21.588 --> 10:34.804
attempt to try and document as much as I could the creation of the great libraries and the efforts and the contributions put forward and put forth by these private collectors.

10:34.844 --> 10:36.906
Now, how do we get the title of Gentle Madness?

10:38.568 --> 10:50.042
I've worked in Worcester, Massachusetts, and in Worcester is, believe it or not, the oldest library, which is an example of a distinctively American species of library.

10:50.427 --> 10:56.555
the American Antiquarian Society, which was established in 1812 by a gentleman named Isaiah Thomas.

10:57.797 --> 11:01.282
Isaiah Thomas was known in his day as the most prominent printer.

11:01.582 --> 11:03.124
He was a patriot.

11:03.685 --> 11:06.168
He fought at the battles of Lexington and Concord.

11:06.188 --> 11:11.275
He published the first reports of the battles in his Massachusetts spy.

11:12.276 --> 11:15.280
After the war, he was a great printer, binder.

11:15.661 --> 11:19.506
He owned his wood factories to make paper.

11:20.937 --> 11:25.043
He wrote the first history of printing in North America, a book that is still in print.

11:25.724 --> 11:29.008
We don't remember him really for all of these things today.

11:29.028 --> 11:38.862
We remember him for his book collection, which became the American Antiquarian Society, and which became the first of a distinctively American institution, which is a library.

11:39.618 --> 11:51.036
founded by a book collector with a great collection, which is really not connected or associated with any academic institution, but exists with its own endowment, with its own staff, with its own librarians.

11:52.137 --> 11:53.379
It's there to serve scholars.

11:54.040 --> 12:08.342
The AAS was the first, but we also have in the United States the Morgan Library in New York, the wonderful Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C., the Huntington Library in California,

12:09.115 --> 12:10.777
Park Library in Los Angeles.

12:10.797 --> 12:12.138
I mean, you can go on and on.

12:12.178 --> 12:16.602
There are the John Carter Brown Library in Providence, Rhode Island.

12:16.622 --> 12:22.448
And each one reflects a certain kind of a passion, Americana, Shakespeare.

12:22.968 --> 12:26.031
Morgan is, of course, great illuminated manuscripts.

12:27.032 --> 12:29.114
Huntington, of course, is wonderful British things.

12:30.335 --> 12:31.957
The wonderful charts are wonderful things.

12:32.837 --> 12:34.919
It's a distinctively American institution.

12:35.600 --> 12:37.722
Well, when Isaiah Thomas died at the

12:38.191 --> 12:40.014
ripe old age of, I think it was 92.

12:40.274 --> 12:48.846
His grandson said in tribute that grandfather was afflicted at the earliest of ages with the gentlest of infirmities.

12:49.507 --> 12:50.748
He was a bibliomaniac.

12:52.150 --> 12:57.457
I remember reading that phrase and saying, well, you know, there's my title right there.

12:58.118 --> 13:00.602
And thus we have a gentle madness.

13:01.643 --> 13:03.766
And I also take note of the subtitle.

13:04.207 --> 13:07.371
Being a good journalist, I've learned

13:08.195 --> 13:22.651
especially as a book editor, that if you have a long subtitle that pretty much summarizes your book, wherever it's reviewed, you're going to get a nice big boldface ad for free at the top of the piece, Bibliophiles, Bibliomanes, and the Eternal Passion for Books.

13:23.752 --> 13:38.168
I have a definition in the introduction, a German bibliographer by the name of Hans Bohata, who said, the bibliophile is the master of his books, the bibliomaniac, their slave.

13:38.823 --> 13:41.946
And then he also acknowledges that you never really know when you cross the line.

13:43.327 --> 13:46.330
And I'm often asked, am I a bibliomaniac?

13:47.731 --> 13:55.998
One local reviewer in Worcester who said, well, Nick Basbane may not be a bibliomaniac, but he certainly is on the cusp.

13:56.819 --> 13:58.520
And I kind of like that.

13:59.501 --> 14:07.648
I moderated a forum at the American Antiquarian Society a couple of weeks ago, and I was introduced there as a person who really collects collectors

14:08.287 --> 14:26.410
And I guess I like that a lot, because I really do see these people who I've gotten to know and spent a lot of time with them, learning not only about their collections and their collecting and their libraries and their passions, but have become friends in many cases with them, have followed their fortunes.

14:27.071 --> 14:32.438
And I guess I can never afford to own a first folio of Shakespeare.

14:33.481 --> 14:38.668
but I certainly could handle one, as Abel Berland allowed me to do in Chicago.

14:38.688 --> 14:42.113
He'll be in my new book, a chapter on scholar collectors.

14:42.173 --> 14:43.495
I couldn't stay away from the collectors.

14:43.515 --> 14:46.298
The new book is a continuation of themes.

14:46.319 --> 14:56.232
It will involve many book culture considerations, but I will have a chapter on people I consider scholar collectors, another chapter on scholar booksellers.

14:56.887 --> 15:00.731
technology, preservation, libraries through history, libraries of the future.

15:00.771 --> 15:16.748
I'm really going off the deep end here, perhaps, which may in a few minutes bring us to Stephen Blumberg, my book thief, by the way, who is the example of the collector who kind of falls off the cliff.

15:16.768 --> 15:21.473
Now, there was a review in the local paper, which I'm grateful for, very well written.

15:21.513 --> 15:22.815
Thank you very much, sir, if you're here.

15:24.316 --> 15:25.898
The headline said, book croaks.

15:27.110 --> 15:28.451
which is a great phrase.

15:30.413 --> 15:34.818
But I have to say that the book is really not about the theft of books.

15:35.699 --> 15:39.002
I maintain that bibliomania is a very productive thing.

15:40.024 --> 15:52.136
And I think that these libraries and these great collections, the great collections that you have here, I'm sure that a good number of them I've seen, I know a good number of them, come to you courtesy of your friends, of private individuals, of collectors.

15:52.477 --> 15:56.661
It isn't just these individual libraries, by the way, that I've mentioned.

15:57.299 --> 16:12.676
that exist because of collectors, the great collections in many libraries outside, in universities, Harvard, here at HRC, which I have a chapter on at the Lansom Center at the University of Texas in Austin.

16:13.397 --> 16:18.643
Many, many gifts there from collectors, people who have followed their passions.

16:19.825 --> 16:24.690
So then people say to me, well, if you're writing about the

16:25.261 --> 16:27.944
the productive aspects of bibliomania.

16:27.964 --> 16:31.267
What in the world is Steven Blumberg doing in there?

16:31.587 --> 16:35.531
Why do you have this chapter, which you call the Blumberg Collection?

16:36.652 --> 16:42.318
Now, for those of you who haven't read the book, chapter 13, just coincidental that it happens to be chapter 13.

16:43.639 --> 16:47.483
And I noticed, by the way, that you have a room over in the library called the Blumberg Auditorium.

16:47.583 --> 16:49.125
I don't think there's any relationship.

16:49.145 --> 16:53.209
I mean, it's kind of cute.

16:53.678 --> 17:03.167
Stephen Carey Blumberg was arrested 10 years ago in Ottomua, Iowa, by a squadron of 17 FBI agents.

17:04.068 --> 17:23.567
And when they went into his Victorian home, they seized 23,800 books, which he had gathered over the previous 20 years from 268 libraries in 45 states, two Canadian provinces in the District of Columbia.

17:24.458 --> 17:28.603
23,000 books, initially valued at perhaps as high as $20 million.

17:30.286 --> 17:35.252
Later, more realistically, determined to be about $5 million.

17:35.733 --> 17:44.123
The point is, this fellow had spent 20 years traveling the United States, coming... I don't know if he came here, by the way.

17:44.183 --> 17:44.824
I should check.

17:44.864 --> 17:46.847
He may have.

17:47.127 --> 17:49.650
He loved Texas, by the way.

17:49.711 --> 17:52.134
He actually spent a lot of time down here.

17:52.154 --> 17:53.976
He was kind of in the antique business.

17:54.378 --> 17:56.821
He spent 20 years assembling this library.

17:56.841 --> 18:06.553
He had a Nuremberg Chronicle, which is the last great history of the world written prior to the discovery of America, so it makes it very, very interesting.

18:07.154 --> 18:15.645
The author of that book quite wisely left a few blank pages at the back so you could add breaking events such as the discovery of America.

18:15.745 --> 18:21.212
He got his copy of the Nuremberg Chronicle from Claremont College in California.

18:21.800 --> 18:25.784
He had the state of Connecticut's own copy of the first book printed in Connecticut.

18:26.905 --> 18:30.608
And he got that out of the State Library of Connecticut, which is not open to the public.

18:31.910 --> 18:33.351
We still don't know how he got in there.

18:33.371 --> 18:34.092
It was in a vault.

18:35.613 --> 18:39.277
He had books from the University of Michigan.

18:39.297 --> 18:44.181
He had books from Harvard University, the Library of Congress, 268 libraries.

18:44.261 --> 18:50.187
And he actually, now I called him, I call that chapter the Plumberg Collection.

18:50.926 --> 18:51.888
A cute title.

18:52.609 --> 18:58.699
But it does, it does illustrate the difference between a collection and what we call an accumulation.

18:59.541 --> 19:05.531
You know, there are people like the famous Cauldre Brothers in New York who died literally under the weight of all their books.

19:06.352 --> 19:08.115
You know, they collapsed.

19:09.337 --> 19:10.880
But this was just a mass of things.

19:11.020 --> 19:12.242
There was no focus.

19:12.695 --> 19:13.956
Blumberg had a focus.

19:14.036 --> 19:17.100
A collection is a focused extension of your personality.

19:17.820 --> 19:24.147
It reflects your interests in life, your passions in literature or music or whatever.

19:24.868 --> 19:30.333
Stephen Blumberg's passion was Americana, was architecture, was design.

19:31.134 --> 19:37.240
Did I mention that he owned 50,000 doorknobs, antique doorknobs?

19:37.301 --> 19:41.605
He had 120,078 RPM records.

19:41.888 --> 19:45.212
He had 10,000 stained glass windows.

19:45.232 --> 19:49.738
I was thinking at dinner last night in this Tiffany room here at the Camino Real Hotel.

19:49.878 --> 19:55.946
I thought, boy, if Lumberg had ever been here, he would have figured out a way.

19:55.966 --> 19:57.949
There's no question.

19:58.069 --> 20:02.474
His ever-always, we say, he would travel.

20:02.514 --> 20:05.678
He would find condemned structures.

20:05.738 --> 20:07.761
His passion was Victoriana.

20:08.483 --> 20:11.206
And he is quite an authority on these things, by the way.

20:11.247 --> 20:22.601
He would go in and he would strip the place of the stained glass windows or the doorknobs or the fixtures or the fireplace, whatever he could find that was old, that was interesting to him.

20:22.641 --> 20:27.227
Did I mention that he also was a person of independent means?

20:27.247 --> 20:28.569
You would never know it to see him.

20:28.589 --> 20:33.495
He lived, you would think in first seeing him, but he's kind of a homeless person.

20:34.100 --> 20:37.524
But he really was living in the 19th century.

20:38.064 --> 20:39.967
His family is from Minnesota.

20:41.148 --> 20:44.231
They are the largest single owners of real estate in St.

20:44.312 --> 20:44.512
Paul.

20:44.552 --> 20:47.795
So there are some means there.

20:48.036 --> 20:50.418
I think the last estimate I read was $250 million.

20:51.540 --> 20:53.402
Why couldn't he buy the books that he wanted?

20:53.422 --> 20:54.863
He could certainly afford to do that.

20:55.704 --> 20:57.727
But he chose to go and select, as he said.

20:57.767 --> 21:03.313
And he did.

21:04.913 --> 21:27.394
very interesting when he was arrested fully 95 percent of the books that he had were never known to have been missing until the day they were recovered only five percent had been reported missing now this is again you talk about cautionary tales a lot of a lot of like and it's every place in america believe in harvard university

21:27.593 --> 21:32.646
Every place with the greatest security systems were victimized by this fellow.

21:33.247 --> 21:35.553
He really was a brilliant master thief.

21:35.613 --> 21:36.536
He was a cat burglar.

21:36.656 --> 21:42.531
I mean, if you have a chance to read chapter 13, you'll find that he would affect the...

21:43.726 --> 21:45.989
the demeanor of a professor.

21:46.409 --> 21:50.274
He managed to get some documents that identified him as a scholar.

21:50.494 --> 21:52.216
He would travel around with a briefcase.

21:52.737 --> 21:53.358
He would go in.

21:53.378 --> 21:54.819
He would introduce himself.

21:55.681 --> 21:56.902
He'd find his way around.

21:56.922 --> 22:00.266
He'd identify the books that he would want to come back and get later.

22:00.286 --> 22:01.448
How did he get in?

22:01.508 --> 22:02.429
Well, he would find a way.

22:03.090 --> 22:05.953
I don't know how he would do it, but he'd probably find your desk.

22:06.625 --> 22:08.547
I'm talking you generically now, Pat.

22:09.248 --> 22:10.809
But he would find your keys.

22:11.470 --> 22:12.311
He would remove them.

22:12.351 --> 22:13.132
He'd make a copy.

22:13.152 --> 22:14.413
He'd come back later at night.

22:14.473 --> 22:16.395
He would defeat security systems.

22:17.276 --> 22:18.697
He'd back up a pickup truck.

22:19.878 --> 22:21.040
He'd load up with books.

22:21.780 --> 22:25.464
And he did this for 20 years, and he really didn't get caught through any fault of his own.

22:25.724 --> 22:33.392
He had a good friend, good friend in quotes, who got in trouble with the law and turned him in for a bounty of $56,000.

22:34.182 --> 22:37.126
Well, at this birth book, Gentle Madness, I already had the title.

22:37.146 --> 22:38.648
I was working on it.

22:40.070 --> 22:41.531
It had a focus.

22:41.652 --> 22:42.673
I knew where I was going.

22:43.915 --> 22:44.856
I had already sold it.

22:45.296 --> 22:46.438
The contract was signed.

22:47.019 --> 22:50.643
And then I read in the newspaper about the arrest of this fellow in Atomua, Iowa.

22:51.284 --> 22:55.870
And I knew instantly that, you know, it's going to take a little longer to finish this book, I'm afraid.

22:56.542 --> 22:57.904
And so I went out to Des Moines.

22:57.944 --> 23:02.652
I spent two weeks there, got to know Mr. Blumberg, spent a day with him.

23:03.172 --> 23:03.994
He took me down.

23:04.154 --> 23:07.980
He was out on bail while the trial was pending.

23:08.982 --> 23:12.447
On the Saturday, when Court was not in session, he called my room.

23:12.467 --> 23:17.936
He said, would you like to, he had this gravelly voice, would you like to spend a day in the life of Stephen Blumberg?

23:18.076 --> 23:19.338
And I said, what time?

23:19.739 --> 23:20.580
He said, 10 minutes.

23:20.880 --> 23:22.403
And I was out in front of the hotel.

23:22.443 --> 23:23.865
We were on our way.

23:24.048 --> 23:40.488
We went down to a town where he took me into one of the nine warehouses that he is known to have maintained, one down here in Texas, by the way, throughout the United States, where he kept his stained glass windows, his antiques, all of these remarkable things.

23:40.528 --> 23:43.732
The library, by the way, began as a reference library.

23:44.253 --> 23:46.175
He wanted to know more about his antiques.

23:47.096 --> 23:51.642
And then one of the great quotes is, well, you know, us collectors, once we get started, we can't stop.

23:52.010 --> 23:54.834
And I said, well, how does that explain?

23:54.894 --> 23:56.716
He said, Americana, I love Americana.

23:56.736 --> 24:00.141
I said, well, how does that explain the incunabula?

24:00.161 --> 24:06.630
You know, these are books that are 500 years old, published prior to 1501, published in the cradle period of printing.

24:07.150 --> 24:10.475
We call them incunables, which literally means from the cradle.

24:11.617 --> 24:14.380
You know, he had, well, the Nuremberg Chronicle was an incunable.

24:15.101 --> 24:16.503
He had a hundred of these books.

24:16.784 --> 24:19.367
You know, I mean, this is a remarkable collection of...

24:19.786 --> 24:21.147
of 500-year-old books.

24:21.367 --> 24:25.912
And that's when he said, well, you know collectors, once we get started, we really can't stop.

24:27.133 --> 24:33.599
What proved to be part of his undoing was that he collected trophies.

24:34.100 --> 24:35.441
He had three scrapbooks.

24:36.001 --> 24:38.924
When he removed the books, he took them back to a tumbler.

24:40.385 --> 24:42.828
And he would take out, he didn't hurt the books.

24:43.148 --> 24:44.910
He was very good to the books.

24:44.930 --> 24:45.731
He loved the books.

24:45.751 --> 24:47.312
He was passionate about the books.

24:47.832 --> 24:58.767
And when he took them back, he took out the book weights, and he put them all very neatly, pardon me, geographically, and pasted them into these three scrapbooks.

24:59.849 --> 25:04.575
And we talk about jumping ahead, and how I continue to collect my collectors.

25:05.476 --> 25:09.522
I just this summer acquired those three scrapbooks.

25:09.622 --> 25:10.363
They are now

25:10.850 --> 25:35.271
in my collection and they i paid a dear price for them i have to say but uh thankfully the person who had them i mean the federal government had them they and they still have their marking on the exhibit number one and uh and then they were given to creighton university along with books that they couldn't determine the ownership of and creighton

25:36.162 --> 25:44.111
decided that they didn't want to keep them, and they were consigned to a bookseller, and they actually had an auction, and I was given the opportunity to get these.

25:45.152 --> 25:48.056
They belong in my collection, I think.

25:48.076 --> 25:49.838
But they're very, very interesting.

25:49.858 --> 25:53.362
You can really follow this progress around the country.

25:53.382 --> 26:02.052
My daughter is a first-year student at Smith College out in Western Massachusetts, and I know the director of special collections there very well, a fellow by the name of Martin Antonetti.

26:02.953 --> 26:05.916
I was telling them that I had just recently acquired these notebooks,

26:06.622 --> 26:11.747
These scrapbooks, he said, Nick, he said, did he ever get to Smith?

26:12.508 --> 26:13.750
I said, you don't know?

26:14.771 --> 26:15.571
He said, no.

26:16.152 --> 26:17.273
I said, well, let me check.

26:17.874 --> 26:19.075
Well, I sent him an email.

26:19.456 --> 26:21.318
I couldn't bear to call him and break the news.

26:21.378 --> 26:23.980
But there are six different Smith book plates in there.

26:26.083 --> 26:27.444
And two with shelf numbers.

26:27.724 --> 26:30.067
So I said, we don't know what books they were.

26:30.087 --> 26:32.990
But in two instances, there were shelf numbers.

26:33.010 --> 26:34.992
So I said, Martin, let me know what books they were.

26:35.697 --> 26:37.419
And he didn't get back to me on that.

26:37.439 --> 26:40.461
But he has an Ivy League section.

26:40.702 --> 26:42.643
He has a Southwest section.

26:42.683 --> 26:44.045
He has a California section.

26:45.006 --> 26:46.367
And very neatly put together.

26:46.407 --> 26:49.430
Really has a remarkable window into this guy.

26:49.450 --> 26:50.571
Did I mention?

26:50.671 --> 26:52.793
I didn't.

26:52.813 --> 26:55.495
That his trial, he was convicted, by the way.

26:56.336 --> 27:03.763
At his trial, his defense, for what amounted to the only instance in the history of American jurisprudence,

27:04.351 --> 27:13.846
of a case of what I call criminal bibliomania, where the defense was not guilty by reason of insanity.

27:16.651 --> 27:17.632
This is what he claimed.

27:18.213 --> 27:20.517
I thought it was ridiculous until I got to the trial.

27:21.278 --> 27:23.382
And you know, it wasn't that frivolous after a while.

27:23.802 --> 27:26.747
It was demonstrated at this trial.

27:27.082 --> 27:33.570
Then he had had nine institutional admittances.

27:33.670 --> 27:38.376
I'll have to, when I do the text of this talk, I'll have to find a better noun than that.

27:38.476 --> 27:49.290
But he was committed in nine different instances where he was treated, and then always came back to breaking into abandoned houses, going into condemned structures.

27:50.011 --> 27:52.093
Now what's the latest update of Mr. Blumberg?

27:52.914 --> 27:53.956
He did it seven years.

27:53.996 --> 27:55.738
He was released.

27:56.090 --> 28:02.906
He was told to go near no libraries or bookstores or museums or condemned houses.

28:05.030 --> 28:06.373
He was arrested in Des Moines.

28:06.393 --> 28:11.545
He was in a condemned house, stripping the thing of doorknobs, and he's going back for five years.

28:14.191 --> 28:14.993
Go figure.

28:15.698 --> 28:19.021
While he was in prison, we had to maintain the long correspondence.

28:20.042 --> 28:21.984
A fascinating character.

28:22.065 --> 28:25.788
I don't know why nobody from Hollywood hasn't come forward to do a movie on this guy.

28:26.229 --> 28:31.755
If you're going to do a crime story as a writer, I mean, what better story could you possibly have?

28:31.775 --> 28:34.918
Here's a person whose crime idea is that he loves books too much.

28:35.799 --> 28:36.479
He really does.

28:36.519 --> 28:44.828
I mean, there's no murder, there's no rape, there's no child abuse, there's no battering, there's no trucks.

28:45.314 --> 28:49.660
Everything that was stolen was returned in a better shape than it was when it was taken.

28:50.501 --> 28:52.985
So if you have to do a crime story, that's not bad.

28:54.187 --> 28:56.951
I taped the seven hours.

28:56.971 --> 29:02.639
So I have this wonderful archive of tape-recorded conversation with him.

29:03.640 --> 29:08.968
And as we're driving down to a tumble, you can hear him say at one point, shut the tape recorder off.

29:09.489 --> 29:10.410
Okay, I shut it off.

29:11.453 --> 29:22.590
He was holding out as a bargaining chip the fact that he knew where all the books came from, because he had taken out all the book plates and he had disguised provenance, as we say in the book world, with prior ownership.

29:24.433 --> 29:31.384
So he pretty much figured that he could help them, and if he helped them determine where the books came from, then that might get him a lighter sentence.

29:32.585 --> 29:35.710
He said, you know the Uncle Tom's cabin I think I got from Harvard?

29:37.052 --> 29:38.254
I said, USC.

29:38.858 --> 29:40.160
University of Southern California.

29:40.601 --> 29:43.385
Didn't get it from Harvard, got it from USC.

29:43.425 --> 29:44.888
They discovered that at some point.

29:46.029 --> 29:53.040
He was also working very closely with the FBI to tell them where he got the books.

29:54.142 --> 30:05.440
At one point, there was a special collections librarian from Duke, a gentleman by the name of John Sharp, who went to the warehouse in Omaha, Nebraska, where I was admitted, the only journalist allowed inside, to see these books.

30:05.993 --> 30:07.094
before they were returned.

30:07.675 --> 30:10.138
The FBI agent said, what in the world do you want to come here for?

30:10.198 --> 30:12.701
All it looks like is a library of old books.

30:13.902 --> 30:14.403
No kidding.

30:15.104 --> 30:15.805
That's the idea.

30:15.825 --> 30:17.827
It looks like a library.

30:18.408 --> 30:19.009
That's what it is.

30:19.129 --> 30:19.870
It is a library.

30:21.151 --> 30:31.764
You wonder why a reporter or a journalist always has to see something where you can't really rely on what somebody tells you it looks like or secondhand descriptions.

30:32.665 --> 30:35.308
If you read that chapter, I begin it

30:35.913 --> 30:39.921
with this conversation with the FBI agent saying, why in the world do you want to come out here?

30:40.882 --> 30:46.213
And I go in and I guess what really didn't impress me immediately was the massive books.

30:46.233 --> 30:49.619
What really impressed me were these stenciled signs on the shelves.

30:50.681 --> 30:57.955
University of Michigan, University of Texas, USC, Harvard, Massachusetts Historical Society.

30:58.424 --> 31:10.656
That kind of crystallized for me what this story was about, because he was not only just stealing books, he really was stealing part of our national patrimony, and that is a grievous crime.

31:10.956 --> 31:21.026
You know, I was thinking earlier when you were saying that you have books overdue, I was smiling, I was thinking Clearwater, Florida, you know?

31:21.086 --> 31:27.452
Have you met the story down in Clearwater where these two people had books overdue and they arrested them?

31:28.073 --> 31:30.137
And everybody said, well, I did this just for books.

31:30.617 --> 31:31.359
Just for books?

31:31.419 --> 31:34.945
Well, I said, you know, with all due respect, you've had books out for two years.

31:35.646 --> 31:38.731
Maybe it's not a bad idea to have a little bit of an object lesson.

31:39.372 --> 31:41.837
And then maybe the books won't be read, just books.

31:42.678 --> 31:44.561
But people say to me, I'm a journalist, you know.

31:44.922 --> 31:47.527
You've spent 15 years now writing about nothing but books.

31:48.709 --> 31:51.313
I said, well, what would you have me write about, you know?

31:51.732 --> 31:53.073
I mean, if not books, what?

31:53.193 --> 31:53.714
Oxygen?

31:53.894 --> 31:56.196
I mean, food?

31:56.236 --> 31:57.717
The essentials of life?

31:58.438 --> 32:03.402
I mean, what better thing, as far as I'm concerned, can we write about than books?

32:04.083 --> 32:14.692
We celebrate here, and I failed to mention that because we do honor book design here, the engraving here is called The Book Fool.

32:15.993 --> 32:20.777
It was drawn by Albrecht Durer in the late 1800s.

32:21.095 --> 32:32.791
late 1580, this particular book was printed in 1494 in Basel, in Das Basel or wherever, Das Naranschief, the original Ship of Fools.

32:33.352 --> 32:36.977
And the number one fool in the whole Navy of the Ship of Fools was the book fool.

32:37.899 --> 32:38.900
And so there he is there.

32:39.020 --> 32:44.608
And I remember seeing that picture, that illustration, and I wonder, there it is.

32:44.648 --> 32:45.189
Wonderful.

32:46.891 --> 32:48.053
Well, there it is.

32:48.073 --> 32:49.515
That's 1494.

32:50.305 --> 32:52.209
wood engraving.

32:52.229 --> 33:05.935
I remember when I sent in my manuscript, my 1300s age manuscript to New York, I just kind of Xeroxed this wood cut and put it on top and I said to the editor, try and do something with this with a dust jack.

33:06.725 --> 33:11.469
And maybe if you can just kind of suggest the decorations around the border there.

33:11.489 --> 33:13.371
So I'm not a book designer.

33:14.152 --> 33:17.335
The young woman who did design the book, she did a splendid, wonderful job.

33:17.355 --> 33:19.997
And I have to take credit for the art and for the suggestion.

33:20.077 --> 33:31.207
And I really think that this is one instance where the appearance of a book has just made such a fantastic, you say you can't sell a book by its cover.

33:31.247 --> 33:35.331
Well, I'd like to think that we have seven printings because of the content.

33:35.497 --> 33:37.599
and the stories that I tell.

33:37.659 --> 33:45.927
But I also know that in Christmas of 1995 or 1996, Rizzoli's bookstore in New York gave it a whole window.

33:47.148 --> 33:51.172
And my wonderful mother was in New York to see some plays.

33:51.232 --> 33:52.853
She's 80 years old.

33:52.894 --> 33:55.756
She's walking down Fifth Avenue and she sees the window.

33:56.997 --> 34:01.842
But all copies of my book are in this splendid poster.

34:02.125 --> 34:04.328
And she went in and she said, that's my son.

34:04.348 --> 34:05.949
You have to give me that poster.

34:07.091 --> 34:08.012
I thought she was crazy.

34:09.033 --> 34:09.774
And they refused.

34:09.834 --> 34:12.297
I said, no, mother, they need the poster.

34:12.377 --> 34:13.598
You know, they're trying to sell books.

34:13.678 --> 34:14.739
It's a wonderful poster.

34:14.759 --> 34:16.682
She had to have it.

34:16.702 --> 34:18.504
But she didn't get it, as it turns out.

34:19.365 --> 34:28.335
But it's really quite a thrill still to see it displayed on a screen like this here.

34:28.957 --> 34:34.584
I failed to mention earlier that this is my first trip to El Paso.

34:35.485 --> 34:39.550
I didn't really believe how far west and how far south I was until I did look at the map.

34:40.512 --> 34:42.674
We from New England tend to be pretty smug.

34:43.736 --> 34:54.289
We take pride in the fact that the first printing press in what we now know as the United States was set up in 1639 in Cambridge.

34:54.910 --> 34:59.094
And there the first, the base, what we know is the base of what was printed.

34:59.895 --> 35:05.640
Well, you come down here and you realize that the first press in North America was established in Mexico 100 years earlier.

35:05.720 --> 35:15.589
And the first book in North America was printed, you know, I don't know if it's within eyesight of where we stand, but it is here.

35:15.669 --> 35:22.335
And when Mr. Herzog came here, as he said, as a tenderfoot Yankee,

35:23.024 --> 35:26.188
He came and became known as the printer at the pass.

35:26.888 --> 35:52.558
I just think that is such a delightful, wonderful story and that he celebrated the book not only as an object and as an artifact and as a visual performance but also as a container and a bearer and a vessel of information and the fact that you celebrate his accomplishments and you celebrate him and you have this wonderful competition and you recognize these

35:53.028 --> 35:56.333
wonderful young women who have produced beautiful books.

35:57.315 --> 36:06.911
I just tip my hat to you and I thank you very much for inviting me to join with you here and to share in this celebration of books and to honor these young women for their splendid accomplishments.

36:06.931 --> 36:09.214
And I thank you very much for coming out on a beautiful day.

36:09.274 --> 36:11.458
My wife tells me it's 10 degrees at home.

36:12.147 --> 36:17.317
a little bit of snow overnight, and going down below zero.

36:17.418 --> 36:19.101
And I said, you should be with me in El Paso.

36:19.161 --> 36:20.163
And she said, well, next time.

36:20.243 --> 36:25.334
And I really, truly hope that there is a next time, and that you look out for Lions of the Gate next year.

36:25.394 --> 36:27.979
Thank you very much for coming out for session.

36:42.421 --> 37:07.534
At this time, we will be presenting

37:07.852 --> 37:21.844
The award consists of a prize of $1,000 and a managal design by Todd Lee, who has received 106 entries from publishers and book designers across the country.

37:22.094 --> 37:33.638
a panel of three judges selected as the letter, a publication by the Art Institute of Chicago entitled The Lipograph of San Antonio Whitlam.

37:34.941 --> 37:38.989
The desire for the two bodies set is by Studio Glee.

37:39.610 --> 37:57.833
The Hussard Award judges characterize this work as a tour de force, a monumental work with consistent attention to minds and channels that is very rare to find.

37:57.853 --> 37:59.395
They also describe it as an act of a piece.

37:59.415 --> 38:01.618
The printed boards prepare you for something special in size.

38:01.717 --> 38:19.536
The title page continues to judge, and in the literature's lyricism of the high publishing sets a wonderful sentence for the presentation of Kitzler's images.

38:19.556 --> 38:25.783
The two partners in the Studio Blues, Charles Humbley and Captain Ferguson, have a very impressive list of projects and titles for their credit.

38:26.675 --> 38:41.881
One of the two runners-up in the Hitchcock Award competitions, Sherrick Chung's Stones of China, is also a publication of the Art Institute of Chicago and the Science of My Senior Group.

38:42.342 --> 38:46.168
There may not only be awards for the Hitchcock as the winner, but as the winner of it.

38:47.498 --> 38:58.442
Other titles from Studio Berlin Street to God and Me, a publication of her life in this year.

38:58.462 --> 39:01.288
I followed the poetry song, The Making of Art in the Modern Age, Conflict and Justice.

39:01.825 --> 39:26.116
Julia Margaret Cameron's Wing, another publication of the Art Institute of Chicago, and then an exhibition from the Baker and Albert's Smart Museum of Art called Still More District Journey, even with the pure examples of some of the things that Julia Breed has been working with.

39:26.136 --> 39:28.339
Julia Breed also runs the museum in designing their institutions and other projects.

39:29.315 --> 39:37.178
Carol has a master of fine arts and graphic arts degrees, and Catherine has a master of arts and instruments degrees.

39:37.198 --> 39:43.898
To create a talent at the studio, will you design a place to see the community art in the recent science program?

39:44.671 --> 40:03.743
Some of these come from the Center for Jesus Organizations as the American Association of the University of Franklin, the American Center for Desirements, the American Institute of Graphic Art, the Art Library Association of the American Library Association of the University of Maryland,

40:03.993 --> 40:24.661
the American Association of New Zealand, the Chicago Book Prince, the New Zealand Fundamentals of First Nations, Trent Leonard Reed, and the General Judicial Award.

40:24.681 --> 40:27.706
The friends of Goliath University are very, very happy to be here with Carl McClubbin Ward, to C.O.

40:27.726 --> 40:29.528
Williams, represented by Carol Holmes and Kathy Frederick in the New York City Commission.

40:40.527 --> 41:01.337
And we'll ask each of them to say two words at each time.

41:14.530 --> 41:37.242
I don't have much to say, but I want to thank you all for honoring me, and for the wonderful kindness and hospitality that you've shown to us in our business here.

41:37.262 --> 41:38.503
I especially want to thank Adam and Laura and the library.

41:38.523 --> 41:40.086
It's our first time to have been really a very remarkable and special place.

41:40.106 --> 41:41.888
And I'm delighted to be here.

41:41.868 --> 41:58.924
I just want to say a few words to about the process that we need to be stable.

41:58.944 --> 42:00.646
And a little bit about our partnership.

42:00.666 --> 42:03.769
I first met Carol in 2019 when I was working at the RU to be here in Chicago.

42:03.789 --> 42:08.213
And I've been working for three years with the editor of the period of Carol on this catalog.

42:08.446 --> 42:15.368
And as fun as two hieroglyphs, diviners, diviners, enormous projects.

42:15.685 --> 42:33.152
And most of the time, at that point, that we wanted that the Art Institute awards were from east of state to New York, but we wanted time to come up with students local.

42:33.172 --> 42:40.984
And I remember this, I remember this coming a few weeks earlier to show me her portfolio, and I had to really trust the quality of it, which was right out of graduate school, and she received that in four boys.

42:41.099 --> 42:58.040
So I suppose that when we consider it as a process, we realize that at that time, we had hundreds of millions of pictures, and there were literally hundreds of illustrations.

42:58.060 --> 42:58.841
I think it's too long.

42:58.861 --> 43:00.964
That is over 1,000 print pages.

43:02.564 --> 43:27.854
We offered the project, and we waited to see what would happen, and we started researching material, looking at the trends, learning all about what sort of work, and to remember, .

43:27.874 --> 43:32.520
And for me at this point, we will break through into my career, because through the use of design,

43:32.905 --> 43:43.208
we've been able to capture some of the elements as far as the work.

43:43.228 --> 43:49.562
The way that she, the title of the poetry, the way that the title works, and the way that the lab works, is sometimes something can happen.

43:49.662 --> 43:52.669
For me, the first person is talking about a lot of style that they've written in the photograph.

43:52.649 --> 44:01.172
And she also created a book that was very contemporary and fresh.

44:01.493 --> 44:04.060
And that was a confusion of our relationship.

44:04.242 --> 44:19.056
We've been asked to be partners and eight years have passed.

44:19.076 --> 44:26.523
And I still think about pleasure in the process of discovery that we use when we grow, whether it's for an exhibition or a website.

44:26.543 --> 44:28.205
We're betrayers and we do that too.

44:28.225 --> 44:31.047
But like Nicholas with his project, his book was a 10-year process for me.

44:31.208 --> 44:33.810
And what's really rewarding is that we

44:34.313 --> 44:47.378
We've done something that is hard to do so wonderful and we do love it and we want to thank you for recognizing that and for having a gift.

44:55.508 --> 45:16.909
and how I had a couple of talks to Kathy said, and I think there's some things that have been found for everyone to do with that, and it has been a very wonderful discussion to all of that.

45:16.929 --> 45:21.533
So I think having that been particularly touched by the three reasons that have been our options as all of our patients have been used by this as we tried to explain it now.

45:21.513 --> 45:32.535
I think it allows you to be cranial to use in each sort of forces that they'll use each other's spirit.

45:32.667 --> 45:53.490
a combination of learning and reading about a subject, and then trying to make this terrible, miserable form that you have to accept subject in some way that means your own business has to get.

45:53.510 --> 45:55.592
It's really one of the hardest but rewarding challenges you've found.

45:55.612 --> 45:59.316
Carpenter taught yourself to have set a step, and he said that a book is circumcised, whether they are talking about the errors or cultivating,

45:59.549 --> 46:15.145
It's so peculiar to one that it's been kind of a trick, because something is kind of a enough cause of a testifier to the common care.

46:15.165 --> 46:18.773
And what we also show up that we need in a serial about that thought is that it is not from the West, but it is happening to someone.

46:18.753 --> 46:35.519
In learning about the West, I think he's been a curious caller, and then he arrived.

46:35.539 --> 46:37.762
He's been extremely powerful and effective international.

46:37.782 --> 46:40.727
I think that's the exact same process that you take on when you work on new projects that you really have to take.

46:40.707 --> 47:03.209
delve into the approach that we're doing in a way to be able to create something better.

47:03.229 --> 47:08.014
I also want to mention a little bit about the corroborative nature to the abuse has been said that in particular words like pain and still pain is the probability of the hard mind being able to come together.

47:07.994 --> 47:23.911
And each of that plays several roles from a book.

47:23.931 --> 47:27.475
He's believed by musicians, stories about the knowledge of the information organizers, to experts, to social projects, and to manage their opportunities.

47:27.495 --> 47:29.957
And he's a weird role with his head, and he's really paralleled the technique with the practice of running time in the air.

47:29.977 --> 47:31.639
He's on his sometimes functions out there, and sometimes it's time to do it.

47:32.632 --> 47:47.401
What I really used to occur is a book that stars me down in Arusha, where you can study the biology, and I've been born, and I need to explore any type of stories in the book of it, which is what you find in the future of that nature.

47:47.421 --> 47:47.822
Thank you very much.

48:05.538 --> 48:25.925
At this time, I also, again, want to acknowledge the support that we have, and this is a lot of times, it has to be somewhat similar to the unthinkable speech.

48:25.946 --> 48:27.928
They've got permission to have support in this lecture, and I want to write them.

48:27.948 --> 48:32.254
So there are some of the writers that have come from the library, and you seem to know if you can continue here in the practice.

48:32.234 --> 48:53.189
And I don't know if you have any friends here, but we want to again say thank you to the Texas Center for the work for his contribution to the president of Jordan and Dr. Roy West.

48:53.209 --> 48:55.513
And I also want to express again my appreciation to the Carl and Sam and to St.

48:55.533 --> 48:56.655
Laura for all his efforts in making this event possible.

48:56.635 --> 49:06.709
And it's about free justice.

49:06.729 --> 49:17.063
Professor Rocha Johnson-Arlo, Mr. George Wood, his family, Mr. Robert Stiegel.

49:17.083 --> 49:18.205
He was in the community at one time.

49:18.225 --> 49:20.108
He used to be the right thing autographed in our pastor.

49:20.128 --> 49:21.069
He came back to be one of our pastor's stories.

49:21.089 --> 49:24.153
Rocha Johnson-Arlo, a faculty member here at East County, graduated by, and there was some employment experience.

49:24.173 --> 49:25.495
And that was the UC Press, and put it down.

49:25.475 --> 49:45.721
And at this time now, we will invite the police to go and have a lobby and protect the body of justice.

49:45.741 --> 49:47.042
And they will have a lot of peace in our world and our community.

49:47.062 --> 49:47.483
Thank you for coming.

49:48.779 --> 49:58.861
Oh, well, I deserve it.

49:59.383 --> 50:03.412
We'll let you, I'll get you out of it.

50:03.432 --> 50:05.877
It's not two years.

50:05.857 --> 50:30.047
I was tempted to lunch and drink myself, but I thought that probably was not my role.

50:30.067 --> 50:31.509
I thought I was thinking, well, just look on the impression of his face.

50:31.529 --> 50:32.810
I don't know what he's putting on here with his crap in the air.

50:32.830 --> 50:33.251
What was that, Frank?

50:33.271 --> 50:33.812
No, I hadn't thought of it.

50:33.832 --> 50:34.092
Look at that.

50:34.072 --> 50:50.908
You know, I would like that.

50:50.928 --> 50:51.569
There wasn't nothing in my head.

50:51.589 --> 50:52.030
I would like to do it.

50:52.010 --> 51:07.093
I have a man for you.

51:07.113 --> 51:07.654
I'll put it in my new book.

51:07.674 --> 51:08.495
Did you have that meeting with the mayor?

51:08.515 --> 51:09.276
I got a message or something about it.

51:11.686 --> 51:28.372
I have Bob Skimmett, a local author, who writes and authored his system.

51:28.392 --> 51:29.674
He's probably sold three million copies, so he's not a beginner.

51:29.694 --> 51:29.934
What's that?

51:29.954 --> 51:30.555
He's not published in America.

51:30.940 --> 51:54.031
Oh, it's wonderful.

51:54.051 --> 51:54.271
I loved it.

51:54.291 --> 51:54.432
No, no.

51:54.452 --> 51:55.553
I started going for things that I didn't mean to go to.

51:55.573 --> 51:55.833
You're right.

51:55.853 --> 51:56.254
How do I just do it?

51:56.274 --> 51:56.474
Let's see.

51:56.494 --> 51:56.795
Where do we go?

51:56.815 --> 51:57.015
I'm sorry.

51:57.620 --> 52:22.564
Let's go outside and let's get you a table if you don't mind where you can be seated.

52:29.024 --> 52:53.496
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...

52:53.948 --> 53:01.382
And we have a very fine collection of very fine books.

53:02.083 --> 53:06.731
I'm curious, are there any folks there from Dallas?

53:07.733 --> 53:11.400
Recently, actually, regarding our security.

53:11.380 --> 53:37.643
He passes through Dallas on his way.

53:37.663 --> 53:38.704
He gets four-signed a lecture at the Ransom Library.

53:38.724 --> 53:39.105
Well, I invite you.

53:39.125 --> 53:40.085
Have the first folio bus in the airport tonight.

53:40.105 --> 53:40.746
We also have a new copy of that.

53:40.726 --> 54:05.902
He has an e-mail address.

54:05.922 --> 54:06.343
Right now, I'm sorry.

54:06.363 --> 54:06.463
Okay.

54:07.304 --> 54:27.777
regarding the lines there must be an explanation.

54:27.797 --> 54:28.318
It could be, you know, St.

54:28.338 --> 54:29.099
Jerome is always picking up the lines.

54:29.119 --> 54:30.141
Some people say he did these things in the library.

54:30.161 --> 54:30.622
That's not good enough.

54:30.642 --> 54:31.523
This is something I don't want to go on for.

54:31.908 --> 54:44.702
This is a couple of things put together by WCBH, and it's a... I'll look at that.

54:45.661 --> 55:04.115
I wonder if you could pass it for longer.

55:04.135 --> 55:04.475
I'll make copies.

55:04.495 --> 55:05.357
I'll make copies and give you a good check.

55:05.607 --> 55:10.857
Have you heard of the Antiques Roadshow?

55:10.877 --> 55:12.480
Oh, yeah.

55:12.500 --> 55:14.524
This is a guy that's developed it.

55:14.544 --> 55:19.834
This guy's got to buy this big money from them, and they're really going to do a second.

55:19.854 --> 55:21.778
Maybe I'll send you a comment about it.

55:21.798 --> 55:25.225
Well, Antiques Roadshow is just coming to Austin, and I told Branson to get in touch with you.

55:25.245 --> 55:26.347
How are you doing?

55:26.367 --> 55:27.970
How are you doing?

55:33.856 --> 55:41.907
I think, I think, I hope it's going to go away.

55:41.987 --> 55:47.995
L-I-B-X-C-I dot... Dallas, D-A-D-L-I-S.

55:48.175 --> 55:54.143
Maybe we can have a little... I'll have some... He sure does.

55:54.163 --> 55:54.643
Yes, I do.

55:54.783 --> 56:01.332
We, we... Take a ride.

56:01.733 --> 56:04.758
I don't want to just focus on San Francisco.

56:04.778 --> 56:04.898
Right.

56:04.918 --> 56:07.382
Well, I'm off to me with what's going on.

56:07.402 --> 56:08.764
It's really coming down.

56:08.785 --> 56:10.708
The incident in Florida.

56:11.469 --> 56:12.230
Florida.

56:12.250 --> 56:13.132
What's the end of Florida?

56:13.272 --> 56:14.874
What happened in Florida?

56:14.894 --> 56:16.217
Real clear one.

56:16.277 --> 56:17.138
Okay, yeah.

56:17.399 --> 56:26.153
Let's go ahead and get over here.

56:26.173 --> 56:26.273
Okay.

56:27.232 --> 56:56.091
I've been checking out.

56:56.476 --> 57:11.582
Here we go.

57:11.562 --> 57:26.004
The Dallas Public Library is the road institution for the Texas Center for the Book.

57:26.525 --> 57:29.169
Your donation is in his contract.

57:30.230 --> 57:31.512
Well spent, well spent.

57:31.492 --> 57:57.162
I think I don't know.

57:57.142 --> 58:10.836
If I held in some reason, would you do it?

58:10.856 --> 58:13.538
I'd rather sit down.

58:13.558 --> 58:16.882
Okay.

58:16.902 --> 58:20.045
Right over here.

58:20.065 --> 58:20.706
It could be right over here.

58:20.726 --> 58:21.526
I don't sign them standing up with that.

58:21.546 --> 58:23.188
I heard from him in the hospital, so I was going to sign him.

58:23.208 --> 58:24.109
Well, let's do it right now.

58:24.129 --> 58:24.650
Well, I mean, I should go.

58:24.670 --> 58:24.770
Okay.

58:24.790 --> 58:24.970
Sit down.

58:24.990 --> 58:25.090
Okay.

58:25.070 --> 58:45.516
You don't have to tell them stories before you're wealthy.

58:45.536 --> 58:46.858
If you're wealthy, you have a secretary to take care of the court.

58:46.838 --> 59:12.898
Has anybody ever known me about it?

59:12.918 --> 59:13.078
I can't.

59:13.098 --> 59:13.299
You can't?

59:13.319 --> 59:13.639
Everybody knows.

59:13.619 --> 59:34.731
Thank you for your book.

59:34.751 --> 59:34.851
Okay.

59:38.341 --> 59:56.661
Beautiful.

59:56.681 --> 59:57.042
Thank you so much.

59:57.022 --> 01:00:25.000
And then she called me when you were on television, and I got to see you on television.

01:00:25.021 --> 01:00:26.843
So this is for sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar.

01:00:35.682 --> 01:00:59.626
I just get to visit with you at that luncheon the other day.

01:00:59.646 --> 01:00:59.786
I know.

01:00:59.806 --> 01:01:02.468
Because they had all you important people up there, but I had to take things and she had them.

01:01:02.489 --> 01:01:03.149
Well, it's nice to see you again.

01:01:03.169 --> 01:01:03.269
Yeah.

01:01:03.289 --> 01:01:04.310
Do you know how we're going to move to White Acres?

01:01:04.330 --> 01:01:04.911
I'm going to talk about that.

01:01:04.931 --> 01:01:05.031
Yeah.

01:01:05.011 --> 01:01:15.845
Are you going to pee for cats?

01:01:15.865 --> 01:01:27.420
And I hope you will come back and bring your wife home.

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:28.842
And you know, I want you to turn my book and get going to your family.

01:01:28.862 --> 01:01:29.884
I went after your flight of the 10th last year.

01:01:29.904 --> 01:01:30.985
I had a hipster place because my texts are gone.

01:01:30.965 --> 01:01:56.502
Oh, I'm doing great.

01:01:56.522 --> 01:01:56.722
Thank God.

01:01:56.742 --> 01:01:57.343
There's a decoration in there.

01:01:57.323 --> 01:02:23.219
Now, this would be a S-A-N-A-C exercise.

01:02:23.239 --> 01:02:23.480
A-C-O-V-A-L.

01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:23.820
S-A-N-G-O-V-A-L.

01:02:24.138 --> 01:02:46.130
Also known as?

01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:46.231
Yes.

01:02:46.251 --> 01:02:46.531
Also known as?

01:02:46.551 --> 01:02:46.852
You can answer.

01:02:46.872 --> 01:02:47.092
No, no, no.

01:02:47.112 --> 01:02:47.192
Why?

01:02:47.172 --> 01:03:10.702
I just got left out.

01:03:10.722 --> 01:03:11.122
I just got left out.

01:03:11.143 --> 01:03:11.543
I just got left out.

01:03:11.523 --> 01:03:29.042
Thank you.

01:03:29.022 --> 01:03:51.351
I've never written a script to my script to my script to my script to my script to my script to my script to my script to my script to my script to my script to my script to my script

01:03:51.803 --> 01:04:17.430
Do you like her at the table?

01:04:17.450 --> 01:04:17.831
Now I've got to go.

01:04:17.851 --> 01:04:18.151
I've got to go.

01:04:18.171 --> 01:04:18.471
I've got to go.

01:04:18.491 --> 01:04:18.792
I've got to go.

01:04:18.812 --> 01:04:18.992
Oh, good.

01:04:19.012 --> 01:04:19.212
Thank you.

01:04:19.192 --> 01:04:39.957
See, let's go around and get a picture of me.

01:04:39.977 --> 01:04:40.117
You OK?

01:04:40.137 --> 01:04:40.798
Oh, I went around the block, huh?

01:04:40.818 --> 01:04:41.058
Get me back.

01:04:41.078 --> 01:04:41.519
I was looking for you.

01:04:41.539 --> 01:04:42.259
Well, I was coming around the block.

01:04:42.279 --> 01:04:43.020
I wouldn't be it the way I wanted to.

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:44.482
If I hit my nose that much, and all of a sudden, I got to get a picture.

01:04:44.502 --> 01:04:44.883
I'll be right back.

01:04:44.903 --> 01:04:45.283
I'll be right back.

01:04:49.415 --> 01:04:54.072
Yeah.

01:04:54.092 --> 01:04:54.193
Yeah.

01:05:03.742 --> 01:05:10.853
All right.

01:05:10.873 --> 01:05:11.234
Ready?

01:05:11.314 --> 01:05:16.002
He didn't wait.

01:05:19.107 --> 01:05:24.175
You were very entertaining.

01:05:24.435 --> 01:05:25.457
You were wonderful.

01:05:25.477 --> 01:05:28.321
You were wonderful.

01:05:28.342 --> 01:05:30.525
I think Judge O'Ran is so long about my bookshelf.

01:05:31.130 --> 01:05:54.622
You've told me.

01:05:54.642 --> 01:05:55.444
Do we have to take the picture with him?

01:05:55.464 --> 01:05:55.804
Okay, quite okay.

01:05:58.585 --> 01:06:17.775
Keep working.

01:06:24.893 --> 01:06:38.341
I can't.

01:06:38.361 --> 01:06:38.802
You don't like my man.

01:07:05.798 --> 01:07:19.521
One, two, three.

01:07:22.184 --> 01:07:37.423
Okay, hold it.

01:07:37.443 --> 01:07:42.009
Just one another.

01:07:42.029 --> 01:07:42.089
Oh.

01:07:42.109 --> 01:07:42.790
So you can be in the picture.

01:07:42.810 --> 01:07:44.312
That's a very nice idea.

01:07:44.332 --> 01:07:44.412
Wow.

01:07:46.045 --> 01:07:55.498

Oh, that's huge.

01:09:05.681 --> 01:09:06.102
That's a great thing.

01:09:06.122 --> 01:09:06.843
One of our famous people in Chicago.

01:09:06.863 --> 01:09:07.403
I almost yelled out to you.

01:09:07.423 --> 01:09:08.024
Can we get anything from that?

01:09:08.044 --> 01:09:08.124
Yes.

01:09:08.144 --> 01:09:08.405
It has to be.

01:09:08.425 --> 01:09:08.685
It has to be.

01:09:08.665 --> 01:09:29.283
Do you buy anything?

01:09:29.303 --> 01:09:29.904
Can you get any of that stuff?

01:09:29.924 --> 01:09:30.505
No, so you couldn't touch me.

01:09:49.047 --> 01:09:55.996
I'm going to put Nick at a table.

01:09:56.016 --> 01:10:01.744
Why don't we put a place, let's find a central place for the two ladies.

01:10:02.164 --> 01:10:14.380
And I'll bring you all to the table.

01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:37.965

01:10:37.985 --> 01:10:38.125
Really?

01:10:38.145 --> 01:10:38.706
I don't want to put you out.

01:10:38.726 --> 01:10:39.186
They'll give you cards.

01:10:39.571 --> 01:10:56.961
Just in case you need a designer, exactly.

01:10:57.583 --> 01:11:03.473

01:11:03.493 --> 01:11:03.894

S-K-I-M-I-N-O-S-K-I-N-O-S-K-I-N-O-S-K-I-N-O-S-K-I-N-O-S-K.

01:16:33.305 --> 01:16:44.992
So whatever you can do to help me.

01:16:45.012 --> 01:16:45.373
Yeah, we can chat.

01:16:45.393 --> 01:16:45.674
I'm very keen.

01:16:45.694 --> 01:16:46.676
I have a chapter of public libraries in New York.

01:16:46.696 --> 01:16:48.360
I think I've got more public libraries in New York and public politics in Michigan.

01:16:48.695 --> 01:17:15.745
Right.

01:17:15.765 --> 01:17:16.446
Well, we've had a lot of problems.

01:17:16.466 --> 01:17:17.267
Hopefully, we're going to get them down.

01:17:18.192 --> 01:17:37.751
When I was on the board a couple of years ago, we discovered that we had a collector, too.

01:17:37.771 --> 01:17:40.433
We decided the following system was not very adequate.

01:17:40.613 --> 01:17:42.255
Is this your card?

01:17:42.395 --> 01:17:44.197
No, he's in the CGL.

01:17:44.217 --> 01:17:44.537
Okay, very good.

01:17:45.361 --> 01:18:07.432
Yes, sir.

01:18:07.452 --> 01:18:07.652
I'm sorry.

01:18:07.672 --> 01:18:07.933
No, I didn't.

01:18:07.953 --> 01:18:08.213
No, I didn't.

01:18:14.858 --> 01:18:33.865
Are you a biophile, Howard?

01:18:33.885 --> 01:18:34.526
Howard, would you like to learn?

01:18:34.546 --> 01:18:35.187
Howard, would you like to learn?

01:18:35.207 --> 01:18:35.848
Howard, would you like to learn?

01:18:35.868 --> 01:18:36.509
Howard, would you like to learn?

01:18:36.529 --> 01:18:37.170
Howard, would you like to learn?

01:18:39.749 --> 01:19:06.134
Yeah, I used to try it.

01:19:06.154 --> 01:19:06.594
I don't know about it.

01:19:06.614 --> 01:19:06.834
No problem.

01:19:06.854 --> 01:19:07.575
I don't see me holding up the crowd.

01:19:07.595 --> 01:19:08.236
Yeah, they're pretty much there.

01:19:08.256 --> 01:19:08.676
I know, it's a crash.

01:19:08.656 --> 01:19:31.356
Thank you very much.

01:19:31.336 --> 01:19:58.841
Oh, I'm already into it, and I just got to get to it.

01:19:58.861 --> 01:19:58.961
I do.

01:19:58.981 --> 01:20:00.042
I am a graphic artist, and so I really appreciate it.

01:20:00.062 --> 01:20:00.242
Oh, yeah.

01:20:00.262 --> 01:20:00.682
Oh, I really like it.

01:20:00.702 --> 01:20:00.963
I don't know.

01:20:00.983 --> 01:20:01.343
I think it's good.

01:20:01.323 --> 01:20:27.176
Thank you.

01:20:27.196 --> 01:20:27.516
And this is for?

01:20:27.536 --> 01:20:27.637
Mary.

01:20:27.657 --> 01:20:27.997
And I'll go home.

01:20:28.017 --> 01:20:28.097
OLD.

01:20:28.117 --> 01:20:28.197
OLD.

01:20:28.217 --> 01:20:28.297
OLD.

01:20:28.317 --> 01:20:28.798
Actually, I correct you.

01:20:28.778 --> 01:20:49.905
What is it?

01:20:49.925 --> 01:20:50.446
Oh, I know all about that.

01:20:50.466 --> 01:20:50.827
Do you do e-mails?

01:20:50.847 --> 01:20:50.907
No.

01:20:50.927 --> 01:20:51.107
My son...

01:20:51.087 --> 01:21:06.741
Oh, but I don't know myself.

01:21:06.761 --> 01:21:07.161
I can write it down.

01:21:07.181 --> 01:21:07.442
I can get it.

01:21:07.422 --> 01:21:32.556
I bet you know what it's like.

01:21:32.577 --> 01:21:32.957
I bet you're right.

01:21:37.207 --> 01:22:03.161
Oh, it's in the grass.

01:22:03.181 --> 01:22:03.621
Oh, it's in the grass.

01:22:03.641 --> 01:22:04.082
Oh, it's in the grass.

01:22:04.102 --> 01:22:04.542
Oh, it's in the grass.

01:22:04.562 --> 01:22:05.003
Oh, it's in the grass.

01:22:04.983 --> 01:22:20.005
That wasn't easy.

01:22:19.985 --> 01:22:45.956
Oh, yeah?

01:22:45.976 --> 01:22:46.357
Oh, no, I got them.

01:22:46.377 --> 01:22:46.617
Where is it?

01:22:50.174 --> 01:23:16.200
What?

01:23:16.220 --> 01:23:16.300
Yes.

01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:40.620
Try again.

01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:42.081
And the mix for a friend who couldn't have been made for a second while.

01:23:42.101 --> 01:23:44.024
And it's been a very difficult time for a friend who couldn't have been made for a second while.

01:23:44.044 --> 01:23:45.966
And it's been a very difficult time for a friend who couldn't have been made for a second while.

01:23:59.159 --> 01:24:22.056
Yeah.

01:24:22.076 --> 01:24:22.717
She and I are in the club, yeah.

01:24:22.737 --> 01:24:23.539
And she's in the club, isn't that right?

01:24:23.559 --> 01:24:23.659
Yeah.

01:24:23.679 --> 01:24:24.360
South America's in the club, yeah.

01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:24.741
We're in the club.

01:24:24.761 --> 01:24:25.121
We're in the club.

01:24:25.141 --> 01:24:25.502
We're in the club.

01:24:25.522 --> 01:24:25.882
We're in the club.

01:24:25.902 --> 01:24:26.263
We're in the club.

01:24:35.423 --> 01:24:49.028
It's very nice.

01:24:52.248 --> 01:25:10.838
Thank you so much.

01:25:10.858 --> 01:25:11.299
And thanks for coming.

01:25:11.319 --> 01:25:11.640
Congratulations.

01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:11.780
Hello.

01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:12.501
And if you do, I want to volunteer.

01:25:12.481 --> 01:25:36.755
Can you encourage work?

01:25:36.775 --> 01:25:37.796
Can I have a San Antonio paper in one of my papers?

01:25:37.816 --> 01:25:37.936
Is it?

01:25:37.957 --> 01:25:38.377
Is Dallas finding it?

01:25:38.397 --> 01:25:39.358
No, I really have never had a chance to grow it.

01:25:39.378 --> 01:25:39.859
I just started doing it.

01:25:39.879 --> 01:25:40.480
While I was writing this book.

01:25:40.460 --> 01:26:03.073
It's a lot of fun.

01:26:03.093 --> 01:26:03.453
It's a lot of fun.

01:26:03.473 --> 01:26:03.834
It's a lot of fun.

01:26:03.854 --> 01:26:04.215
It's a lot of fun.

01:26:04.235 --> 01:26:04.595
It's a lot of fun.

01:26:04.615 --> 01:26:04.976
It's a lot of fun.

01:26:04.996 --> 01:26:05.356
It's a lot of fun.

01:26:05.376 --> 01:26:05.737
It's a lot of fun.

01:26:05.757 --> 01:26:06.117
It's a lot of fun.

01:26:06.137 --> 01:26:06.498
It's a lot of fun.

01:26:06.518 --> 01:26:06.878
It's a lot of fun.

01:26:06.898 --> 01:26:07.259
It's a lot of fun.

01:26:07.279 --> 01:26:07.639
It's a lot of fun.

01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:08.020
It's a lot of fun.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:30.371
It's in Pittsburgh, it's in Nashville, it's in Worcester, it's in Oregon.

01:26:30.391 --> 01:26:31.572
As soon as I have time, I'll just throw it in a little bit.

01:26:31.592 --> 01:26:32.514
I'm going to write the children's book anyway.

01:26:32.534 --> 01:26:34.176
What I'm saying is I really feel very profoundly books, not only books, but books.

01:26:34.156 --> 01:26:52.625
I have some great ideas for some stories.

01:26:52.645 --> 01:26:53.005
Oh, do you really?

01:26:53.025 --> 01:26:54.147
In fact, the first idea that I've got was from Congress.

01:26:54.167 --> 01:26:54.848
I've had aspirations or something.

01:26:54.828 --> 01:27:05.799
I mentioned it.

01:27:05.819 --> 01:27:07.725
I had a publication where he said, if you do that book, there's a little design in the library.

01:27:07.745 --> 01:27:08.326
I actually propose two books.

01:27:08.347 --> 01:27:08.487
Really?

01:27:08.507 --> 01:27:08.607
Yeah.

01:27:08.627 --> 01:27:08.888
I can't miss.

01:27:09.357 --> 01:27:30.783
Every one would be about a book as an object.

01:27:30.803 --> 01:27:31.604
This particular book would be a glamour.

01:27:31.624 --> 01:27:32.486
They would have people on their kind of TV.

01:27:32.506 --> 01:27:32.946
It's a ball of a cart.

01:27:32.966 --> 01:27:33.527
They spend 25 cents a while.

01:27:33.547 --> 01:27:34.728
The book would be heightened, too late, that's what we say.

01:27:34.748 --> 01:27:36.951
From this book, here comes the registration procuration, and the paper and address, and the person sent there.

01:27:36.931 --> 01:27:56.794
He's been warned, he never had a second grade education, but he did teach himself how to read this book.

01:27:56.814 --> 01:27:57.555
So what is the story behind the book?

01:27:57.575 --> 01:27:58.476
And I think it could tell the story about it.

01:27:58.496 --> 01:27:59.517
And it's very well, so I'd like to know what it is.

01:27:59.537 --> 01:28:00.558
And so I think you think that would be interesting.

01:28:00.578 --> 01:28:01.179
Yeah, I think it would be fun.

01:28:01.199 --> 01:28:01.960
Well, right now, you know what I mean?

01:28:05.365 --> 01:28:32.112
No.

01:28:32.132 --> 01:28:32.593
I thought you had heat.

01:28:32.613 --> 01:28:32.993
You're a hurricane.

01:28:42.693 --> 01:29:09.602
Okay.

01:29:09.622 --> 01:29:09.762
Uh-huh.

01:29:09.783 --> 01:29:09.883
Good.

01:29:09.903 --> 01:29:11.044
And the Bonneke Library, do you get any of what you mean?

01:29:11.064 --> 01:29:11.164
Yeah.

01:29:20.037 --> 01:29:41.877
Yes, she's cute.

01:29:42.278 --> 01:29:58.265
I love her.

01:29:58.285 --> 01:30:00.068
Well, you know, I couldn't get too excited to go to Bloomberg if I could understand that.

01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:23.642
What's going on, of course?

01:30:23.622 --> 01:30:37.480
Isn't that amazing?

01:30:37.645 --> 01:30:59.789
When I was in college, we used to read Jill.

01:30:59.809 --> 01:31:01.070
You know, I've got 25,000 hours, and we read Jill all day long.

01:31:01.090 --> 01:31:02.452
But they took the names of a lot of archived areas and universities.

01:31:02.472 --> 01:31:03.153
Now, I don't know who to say that.

01:31:03.173 --> 01:31:05.815
You know, a lot of universities, archived areas especially, were told, understand what happened to original catalog and other stuff.

01:31:05.835 --> 01:31:06.336
And once there was a lot,

01:31:06.316 --> 01:31:28.070
Well, I'm sure he said thank you.

01:31:28.090 --> 01:31:28.611
I think he said thank you.

01:31:28.591 --> 01:31:53.333
Because Joe was looking at one of the papers at the university, and they could celebrate it.

01:31:53.353 --> 01:31:53.974
And he could even know of that.

01:31:53.994 --> 01:31:54.214
Oh, really?

01:31:54.234 --> 01:31:54.374
Uh-huh.

01:31:54.394 --> 01:31:54.754
I know that, baby.

01:31:54.774 --> 01:31:55.215
Of wanting to possess.

01:31:55.235 --> 01:31:55.335
Yeah.

01:31:55.355 --> 01:31:55.555
I knew it.

01:31:55.575 --> 01:31:55.835
I understood.

01:31:55.855 --> 01:31:56.116
I understood.

01:31:56.136 --> 01:31:56.336
I knew it.

01:31:56.356 --> 01:31:56.556
I knew it.

01:32:02.695 --> 01:32:30.986
My wife, what was secretly in her heart that somebody on the side, they want my collection.

01:32:31.006 --> 01:32:31.226
Oh, oh, oh.

01:32:31.246 --> 01:32:31.467
Oh, oh, oh.

01:32:31.487 --> 01:32:31.867
Well, that is true.

01:32:31.887 --> 01:32:32.668
I can hear myself more of a collection.

01:32:33.982 --> 01:32:49.797
and uh

01:32:53.422 --> 01:33:19.067
.

01:33:19.087 --> 01:33:19.107
.

01:33:19.127 --> 01:33:19.147
.

01:33:19.167 --> 01:33:19.187
.

01:33:19.207 --> 01:33:19.227
.
