00:03.136 --> 00:04.458
Can we talk about Haven or more?

00:07.822 --> 00:09.124
He had come to our house.

00:09.184 --> 00:11.928
We had a house in Riverdale, in the Bronx.

00:12.308 --> 00:15.032
You met your wife here, by the way.

00:15.172 --> 00:16.414
You met your wife here in the state?

00:16.434 --> 00:17.455
Yes, we met in college.

00:21.801 --> 00:25.266
He wanted to see the houses.

00:25.306 --> 00:26.267
Can I see your house?

00:26.327 --> 00:26.868
I said, sure.

00:26.888 --> 00:27.889
So I took him to the attic.

00:28.650 --> 00:29.852
And in the attic, which was

00:30.119 --> 00:39.973
I mean, it wasn't finished or anything, it was just the... I had put on a chimney, I think, on the chimney, the PhD degree, you know, hidden away.

00:40.634 --> 00:44.880
So he sees it and he says, oh, Universitas Harvardiana.

00:45.581 --> 00:47.805
Oh, I went beyond Harvard.

00:47.825 --> 00:53.313
Now, as soon as he said that, I took a tremendous dislike to him because it's a silly statement.

00:53.373 --> 00:54.354
How do you go beyond Harvard?

00:54.374 --> 00:57.479
Yeah, even if you did, what's the point of saying that?

00:57.519 --> 00:59.181
You know, I mean... It's insulting.

00:59.684 --> 01:07.253
It's not only something, it's... it reflects... It's putting you down.

01:07.593 --> 01:09.095
No, no, no, I didn't take it personally.

01:09.355 --> 01:11.978
I had no... But he meant to say that he has surpassed you.

01:12.119 --> 01:13.801
Yeah, but that didn't bother me, you know.

01:14.281 --> 01:24.533
What bothered me is that anybody can make a statement like this, oh, I went beyond Einstein, or... I mean, it's a... it's a... egotistical, it's... No, I reflected on him.

01:24.774 --> 01:25.574
I didn't care about me.

01:26.536 --> 01:27.717
So I said, what do you mean?

01:28.827 --> 01:33.733
He says, well, I have three doctorates.

01:33.753 --> 01:35.455
And that's when I said, oh, in what fields?

01:35.495 --> 01:36.356
Naively, you know.

01:36.556 --> 01:42.963
I said, well, I have a doctorate in classics, physics, and a third one I don't remember.

01:42.983 --> 01:46.067
But I remember he said, classics, because that right away, you know, I mean, I had.

01:46.528 --> 01:47.228
So I said, oh.

01:48.690 --> 01:51.874
And he said, and I know 20 languages right after.

01:52.174 --> 01:53.255
I said, oh, which ones do you know?

01:53.376 --> 01:55.118
You know, I wanted to know.

01:55.138 --> 01:57.180
Oh, well.

01:57.903 --> 01:58.744
Which ones do you know?

01:59.745 --> 02:03.430
And that told me right away that he didn't know any, because he wanted to see which ones I knew.

02:03.510 --> 02:09.438
So whatever I would tell him, that those are... So I said, well, of course, since I know Greek and Latin.

02:09.478 --> 02:12.041
So he says, oh, I never studied those.

02:12.882 --> 02:14.104
And it was just impossible.

02:14.144 --> 02:19.892
And at that point, I decided to drop the conversation, and I realized the guy was full of it.

02:20.032 --> 02:20.232
Yeah.

02:21.038 --> 02:25.024
But when he said, I went beyond Harvard, who says something like this?

02:25.265 --> 02:35.601
But I remember you're saying this because of your own experience with learning and education, and how seriously you did it.

02:35.801 --> 02:41.930
The fact that he was making these claims, it wasn't just idle talk.

02:42.111 --> 02:46.137
If I'd known that all you have to do to get a PhD is say you have one, that would have been so easy.

02:46.157 --> 02:49.442
I can say I have five PhDs, why not?

02:50.468 --> 03:04.305
I mean, it's no big deal to have a PhD, but... Well, for me it was a very big deal, because I came from absolutely nothing.

03:04.886 --> 03:12.375
Well, I had something to prove to myself, and that's why it was a big deal to me.

03:14.337 --> 03:15.078
Anyway, you know what?

03:15.138 --> 03:18.282
I'm going to use the facility here.
