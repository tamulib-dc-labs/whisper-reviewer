00:02.208 --> 00:04.632
Nick, we come back to these fundamentals again.

00:05.713 --> 00:13.685
You can't have a book collection where you and I are checking out 100,000 books a day and you cannot shelf 100,000 books a day coming back in.

00:14.066 --> 00:14.506
Understand?

00:14.686 --> 00:14.867
Yep.

00:15.708 --> 00:17.370
Well, these are just basic fundamentals.

00:17.451 --> 00:24.120
You better be set up if you have a new library opening that you're going to have three times the amount of circulation for at least the first year.

00:25.022 --> 00:28.867
And so you have to have the pages set up, the book trucks.

00:28.887 --> 00:32.012
Everything has to be on go to get those books back on the shelf.

00:32.903 --> 00:33.363
They didn't.

00:33.684 --> 00:38.289
They just piled up there in the room and they moved them into other rooms.

00:38.969 --> 00:40.591
And they were dead storage there then.

00:41.132 --> 00:51.202
So now you run into massive public complaints because your brother goes in and the book has been returned, you returned it, and now they say they can't find it.

00:51.963 --> 00:56.768
Do you think it would have been a good idea when they were building this thing to have a librarian in the loop?

00:57.457 --> 00:59.721
Oh, you should leave.

00:59.741 --> 01:04.629
The thing is, I think some of us, I'm very enamored with my Macintosh computer.

01:05.169 --> 01:05.850
You know, I love it.

01:07.092 --> 01:07.934
I kiss it every day.

01:09.576 --> 01:17.409
But I also, I know when I sit down here, somehow I have to phrase a good sentence.

01:17.429 --> 01:17.669
Right.

01:18.371 --> 01:20.494
And the technology of the computer...

01:20.761 --> 01:36.682
is great to edit and reorganize and so forth, but you and I have to be the ones that give the love and the line and the feel for the words and do the shaping and the creating.

01:36.702 --> 01:38.604
The computer is not good.

01:38.684 --> 01:41.588
And librarians, some of them have become enamored in the last

01:42.378 --> 01:53.192
the last 40 years with this idea that microfilm first is going to do everything and second, the computer is going to do everything and all you have to do is have a fine computer.

01:53.492 --> 01:56.937
But another basic thing, he set up a very poor computer system.

01:56.957 --> 01:59.340
Yeah, that's almost unforgivable.

01:59.400 --> 02:02.023
For a guy that wrote the book called The Electronic Library,

02:02.543 --> 02:03.965
You know, the library.

02:05.306 --> 02:08.290
You think he would have had a terrific computer set up.

02:08.350 --> 02:09.311
Yeah.

02:09.652 --> 02:13.256
The computer system there is not as good as here at the University of Texas.

02:13.276 --> 02:16.060
You know, it's not even comparable in quality.

02:17.502 --> 02:23.269
So a lot of his fundamentals somehow, I think he was caught up.

02:23.671 --> 02:37.360
with this huge task of trying to get the bond issues, get the budget increased, and trying to balance the staff to a degree, that he just couldn't be involved with the basics.

02:37.829 --> 02:40.172
And he didn't delegate anyone to do it.

02:40.393 --> 02:44.238
I think really his priority was, though, in the electronic library, though.

02:44.699 --> 02:44.919
Yes.

02:45.300 --> 02:47.002
I mean, I'm not asking you to comment on that.

02:47.022 --> 02:51.408
I don't think there's much doubt that that's where his interests were.

02:51.428 --> 02:53.351
That's just where his major interests are.

02:53.571 --> 02:53.952
Right.

02:53.972 --> 02:57.677
But there again, he needs to go back and he needs to go over the country

02:57.657 --> 03:03.245
and look to see what's being done in other libraries in this very field, and he's not doing it.

03:03.365 --> 03:21.190
I mean, he denies it now that he cared about books, but, I mean, the fact is he also made the statement when they had that earthquake in 1989, and, you know, and they had some books fall off the shelves, and he said this is an ideal opportunity to clean out the Augean stables.

03:21.951 --> 03:23.013
Oh, yeah.

03:23.073 --> 03:26.938
You know, basically comparing books to horseshit, you know?

03:30.209 --> 03:35.037
But the thing is, I think he played a very vital, important role.

03:35.678 --> 03:39.805
And that is to, he brought vivid attention to that library.

03:40.406 --> 03:42.930
He got a great budget and a book budget.

03:43.451 --> 03:47.998
He got the new building funded, you know, and he got it built.

03:48.485 --> 03:57.096
And now it can be reshaped, and you can add storage space, and they can even go back over to the old main and probably be some stacked space.

03:57.116 --> 03:58.397
No, that's not what's going to happen.

03:58.417 --> 04:00.140
They're going to take over that Brooks Hall.

04:00.400 --> 04:01.902
Yeah, they're going to take over Brooks Hall.

04:02.222 --> 04:08.350
And that looks like it's going to happen, you know, and then they'll have to spend a couple million dollars down there fixing it up.

04:08.810 --> 04:09.832
Yeah.

04:09.852 --> 04:13.076
I've been down there, took a bunch of photographs while I was down there.

04:13.156 --> 04:14.037
Yeah, I went through there.

04:14.017 --> 04:14.938
at that time.

04:15.098 --> 04:17.181
They're damn lucky they've got it, let me tell you.

04:17.321 --> 04:19.083
Well, this is another thing, see?

04:19.103 --> 04:20.325
They stumbled into that.

04:20.785 --> 04:23.148
I mean, it absolutely adjoins the new building.

04:23.388 --> 04:23.949
I know it.

04:24.410 --> 04:26.692
You walk from one to the other without going outside.

04:26.772 --> 04:28.495
You know, that's almost like a godsend.

04:28.695 --> 04:34.922
It's an incredible story, though, that you go out and build a new building and don't have the lineal footage of Shelby doing the old.

04:35.864 --> 04:39.568
And yet that was one of my problems there, was running out of space.

04:39.869 --> 04:44.317
I was just in Germany and Sweden just a couple weeks ago.

04:45.299 --> 04:50.028
And, of course, I went to the brand new Deutsche Bibliothek in Frankfurt.

04:50.048 --> 04:55.218
And they have, what, seven floors of storage space.

04:55.278 --> 04:57.042
The bottom two floors are totally empty.

04:58.044 --> 05:00.949
And that's to take them up to the year 2040.

05:00.929 --> 05:12.266
Then you go to Sweden, and they've got 20 what they call book magazines, and they blasted out 110,000 cubic meters of granite, and they're going down.

05:12.687 --> 05:19.457
Well, something like 40% of that is totally empty, and that's to take them up to the year 2050.

05:19.517 --> 05:26.548
So that seems to me that they're planning to not only maintain existing collections, but

05:26.528 --> 05:28.770
but anticipating the future.

05:28.790 --> 05:31.974
I don't see any of that in San Francisco.

05:32.174 --> 05:33.756
I don't know what happened there.

05:34.737 --> 05:49.713
Most of the staff members that were there when I left, he got rid of several of them, and others have retired, and several have passed away, so I've never been able to talk to anyone to find out exactly what went on the inner planning stages.

05:49.893 --> 05:51.675
They were all new personnel.

05:52.162 --> 05:53.724
that were in on that.

05:54.004 --> 06:00.452
And so it was completely... Well, it is a very interesting story, and I think it's a cautionary tale, too.

06:00.733 --> 06:01.894
Well, it is a cautionary tale.

06:01.914 --> 06:03.176
I think you put your finger on it.

06:04.117 --> 06:06.820
There again, I don't see absolute horrors in it.

06:07.601 --> 06:08.682
You don't see absolute what?

06:09.684 --> 06:10.545
Absolute horror in it.

06:10.645 --> 06:10.945
Okay.

06:11.105 --> 06:11.866
I see a future.

06:11.926 --> 06:16.792
And also, this is what discouraged me when the librarian was there that you talked to.

06:17.033 --> 06:18.895
He said to the press that...

06:19.178 --> 06:29.552
The applicants are spooky, you know, so to speak, about coming to San Francisco because of its, oh, I guess, political unrest or turmoil.

06:30.293 --> 06:33.697
But that is inherent in any public job.

06:34.318 --> 06:38.683
And that is part of the challenge, and that's part of the fun, you know.

06:38.704 --> 06:44.071
The challenge, in other words, it's not the arrival, it's the journey.

06:46.594 --> 06:47.515
That's a good quote.

06:48.237 --> 06:54.608
And the journey is to fulfill the aspirations of a finer library.

06:55.209 --> 06:59.737
And that's where the sheer pleasure of it all is.

07:00.639 --> 07:06.730
You know, and if you go to a library where there's no unrest and there's nothing to be due, it's an awful dull world.

07:06.790 --> 07:09.374
It's just like a book, Nick.

07:09.394 --> 07:10.937
Have you ever found a book...

07:11.474 --> 07:15.920
that people love to read that's written about a happy man?

07:15.940 --> 07:19.544
No.

07:19.945 --> 07:21.267
I don't think so.

07:21.487 --> 07:23.009
There's something out of human condition.

07:23.409 --> 07:25.552
We like to read about the unrest.

07:25.773 --> 07:26.193
That's right.

07:26.253 --> 07:27.014
Conflict, don't we?

07:27.415 --> 07:27.895
Exactly.

07:27.975 --> 07:31.200
Well, the thing is, when I go someplace, I want a conflict.

07:31.340 --> 07:39.270
I want something that's a challenge, you know, and that they say, I know when I went there, you know, I have a quote in this book about Al Swalbucker,

07:39.638 --> 07:46.427
You know, I told you, after they had, see, I think Al was the first one that told me.

07:46.447 --> 07:52.254
He said they had pointed them, and I said, well, Al, why do they cite on a young man in his 30s?

07:53.395 --> 07:58.462
He said, well, I think we need someone who's young and foolish and doesn't know what the hell he's getting into.

07:58.482 --> 08:00.164
And this is what, to me, that's it.

08:00.204 --> 08:07.333
You know, there's more to the truth to that than just that many people don't realize that's what you want.

08:07.600 --> 08:08.221
Exactly.

08:08.501 --> 08:10.603
You know, you want that challenge.

08:12.245 --> 08:13.186
Listen, I've got a 330.

08:14.528 --> 08:16.450
My chiropractor's got to fix my back.

08:17.131 --> 08:20.254
I really killed my back and my leg on this trip to Europe.

08:21.136 --> 08:22.137
It's coming along.

08:22.297 --> 08:25.200
I'm leaving for Italy in a week, and I've got to get squared away here.

08:25.240 --> 08:26.121
What are you doing in Italy?

08:26.922 --> 08:29.745
I'm going to go visit the great Renaissance libraries of Italy.

08:30.246 --> 08:30.847
Oh, yeah.

08:30.867 --> 08:33.810
And I'm going to do an interview with Umberto Eco in Milan.

08:33.790 --> 08:34.712
Oh, my God.

08:34.732 --> 08:44.711
And I'm going to go to the Vatican Library, see Father Boyle, who was the great medievalist who just recently stepped down as the prefect or the librarian there.

08:44.731 --> 08:52.526
And I'm going to be doing a lot of things, going to the Medicea Lorenziana in Florence, which is... You do all this travel.

08:52.566 --> 08:53.308
How do you make a living?

08:54.029 --> 08:55.011
I'm in debt.

08:55.512 --> 08:55.933
You're in debt?

08:55.913 --> 08:59.979
Did you have your wife working?

09:00.760 --> 09:04.506
I write a weekly book column, which brings me in a little bit of income.

09:04.546 --> 09:15.261
I write a monthly column for a magazine, and I just did a piece for Civilization magazine on Murray Sendak, which paid me a nice piece of change.

09:16.503 --> 09:19.187
And then I got a couple contracts for these books.

09:19.775 --> 09:21.637
you know, you go from one to the other.

09:21.677 --> 09:25.201
And I give talks, which give me a little bit of money, too.

09:25.221 --> 09:25.882
Oh, that's good.

09:25.902 --> 09:26.723
That's good.

09:26.743 --> 09:27.644
You've got a good voice.

09:29.887 --> 09:36.154
Listen, so, Bill, I think we've got over an hour here on tape, and I always think an hour is a good place to stop.

09:36.574 --> 09:37.315
That's funny.

09:37.335 --> 09:38.717
I'm sorry talking with you.

09:39.157 --> 09:40.379
But let's do it again.

09:40.419 --> 09:41.320
Okay.

09:41.340 --> 09:42.761
And I'd like to meet you sometime.

09:42.902 --> 09:43.282
We will.

09:43.342 --> 09:44.423
Do you ever come up this way?

09:44.844 --> 09:46.746
Well, I haven't in the last 10 years.

09:47.287 --> 09:48.448
I was going west.

09:48.428 --> 09:50.792
But sometime I may come east, and I'll give you a call.

09:50.812 --> 09:51.193
If you do.

09:51.233 --> 09:52.536
And then, of course, I want to come.

09:53.036 --> 09:53.738
You're in Austin.

09:54.199 --> 09:55.581
Do you ever see my book column?

09:55.601 --> 09:57.565
Do you ever read The American Statesman?

09:57.885 --> 09:58.066
Yes.

09:58.727 --> 10:01.592
Well, I do a weekly book column, and I sell it to them.

10:01.632 --> 10:02.975
They give me a check once a month.

10:03.015 --> 10:04.177
I don't know how often they use it.

10:04.197 --> 10:05.820
They probably use it once or twice a month.

10:06.622 --> 10:08.064
Do you ever read the book pages?

10:08.084 --> 10:09.627
I haven't been using it.

10:10.433 --> 10:11.575
They haven't, huh?

10:11.715 --> 10:12.737
Not that I remember.

10:13.598 --> 10:17.224
It's interviews with authors, basically, you know.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.107
Well, you know, that's very interesting.

10:19.147 --> 10:21.150
You think it's on Sundays?

10:21.911 --> 10:22.452
Yeah, I do.

10:23.614 --> 10:24.075
I'll look.

10:25.197 --> 10:28.061
I mean, they send me a check once a month.

10:28.301 --> 10:29.644
Wonderful.

10:29.664 --> 10:32.268
And they're not for a whole lot of money, but it's basically, you know.

10:32.288 --> 10:33.690
But I haven't picked that up.

10:34.582 --> 10:35.404
But I'll have to look.

10:35.424 --> 10:38.750
I should call this guy Dale Rice one of these days.

10:38.770 --> 10:40.513
See what the story is.

10:40.774 --> 10:41.816
I think I'll call him right now.

10:41.836 --> 10:42.858
I'd hate to rock the boat.

10:42.938 --> 10:45.643
I'd hate to have him say, Jesus, that's right.

10:45.663 --> 10:48.890
I should have stopped that check ages ago.

10:49.170 --> 10:50.793
I wouldn't call him, Mick.

10:50.813 --> 10:52.016
If I see it, I'll let you know.

10:52.076 --> 10:52.356
Yeah.

10:53.579 --> 10:54.120
Okay, great.

10:54.340 --> 10:55.663
Okay, have a safe trip.

10:55.983 --> 10:56.625
Thanks, Bill.

10:56.985 --> 10:57.366
Bye-bye.
