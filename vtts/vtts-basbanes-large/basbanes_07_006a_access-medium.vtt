00:02.900 --> 00:06.805
I'm talking with Michael Zinman in Yonkers, New York.

00:06.885 --> 00:07.586
Is this where we are?

00:08.587 --> 00:08.928
Arsley, New York.

00:08.948 --> 00:09.589
Arsley.

00:09.609 --> 00:10.610
I thought we were in Yonkers.

00:10.630 --> 00:11.852
We're in Arsley, New York.

00:11.872 --> 00:12.693
Oh, you were teasing me.

00:13.173 --> 00:14.435
We're in Arsley, New York.

00:17.739 --> 00:19.141
I can grab some of this food, right?

00:20.062 --> 00:23.847
We're having a lovely lunch in a room that I described on the way in.

00:24.448 --> 00:26.411
It looks kind of like a CIA safe house.

00:27.933 --> 00:28.473
Well, it is.

00:30.035 --> 00:31.978
It's a house where you keep your books, I guess.

00:32.465 --> 00:33.206
Or some of them.

00:33.546 --> 00:33.967
Some of them.

00:37.952 --> 00:41.497
Let's start with you and start with a couple of screen buffs.

00:42.578 --> 00:51.731
Tell me a little bit about yourself, how the man who runs earthworm and becomes a passionate collector of American inference.

00:53.213 --> 01:00.362
Not accustomed as I am to being paid.

01:02.907 --> 01:31.378
I have always been surrounded with books and had an opportunity as a kid to have access to a bookseller or, let me back it up, a refugee cousin

01:31.493 --> 01:36.097
My family came out of Germany in the late 1930s.

01:36.417 --> 01:40.300
A brilliant guy.

01:40.320 --> 01:45.325
And he wanted to be a teacher, but his English was no good.

01:45.345 --> 01:47.747
He couldn't speak English, but it was too guttural German.

01:49.308 --> 01:54.612
He had a knowledge of, I guess, rare books and books, and he became an Italian bookseller.

01:54.632 --> 01:55.593
His name was Walter Ganz.

01:57.855 --> 02:01.298
And he wound up living a block away from us, my family, as I grew up.

02:02.071 --> 02:13.388
I mean, the guy was a prick, but I was probably the only person who ever had access to his library or to his house or had any interest in him.

02:16.473 --> 02:26.007
Because of that, I at least had a passing knowledge of what books were.

02:26.407 --> 02:31.555
I had some idea of the

02:33.931 --> 02:38.576
How do you want to put it?

02:38.596 --> 02:42.501
The form of the book, both physical and intellectual.

02:42.961 --> 02:45.805
The book as object and the book as object .

02:46.806 --> 02:48.047
It's something of value.

02:49.589 --> 02:58.960
At the time, I used to collect

02:59.193 --> 03:01.521
How old were you?

03:02.625 --> 03:06.258
This was, let's say, my late teens, my teens, you know, high school.

03:06.278 --> 03:07.161
You're a New Yorker, right?

03:07.181 --> 03:07.543
New Yorker.

03:08.386 --> 03:08.667
City?

03:09.730 --> 03:10.232
Monkers.

03:10.972 --> 03:17.583
But I used to, my mother used to go to auctions, local auctions and what I loved.

03:17.603 --> 03:18.585
Did she collect?

03:18.605 --> 03:22.572
She was in some sense, but not a book collector.

03:22.592 --> 03:27.580
Not a book collector, but she would collect, you know, tchotchkes and things and art, and she had a fairly good eye.

03:27.620 --> 03:29.083
What is this brand like?

03:29.103 --> 03:30.225
Mozzarella, fresh mozzarella.

03:31.106 --> 03:36.996
It was made about an hour before we bought it.

03:39.440 --> 03:42.024
I used to hang around the auctions, and I started buying prints.

03:42.985 --> 03:49.796
I'm going to buy some nice prints, you know, early and what have you.

03:49.816 --> 03:57.067
And I would buy books occasionally without any concept of what I was buying, except if they were old or not new, and they were a quarter or whatever.

03:57.107 --> 04:06.561
At some point, I decided I wanted... I got interested in Audubon.

04:08.043 --> 04:08.644
as it was.

04:08.864 --> 04:18.254
I don't know why, but I saw some Audubon prints, folio prints of the quadrupeds, mainly the rafts, and I could buy them for like five bucks a piece.

04:19.375 --> 04:24.421
And I was essentially angry at the fact that this gorgeous stuff was so cheap.

04:27.404 --> 04:29.707
I started buying... But is your background bookish?

04:29.727 --> 04:30.408
Did you read a lot?

04:30.648 --> 04:31.048
Oh, yeah.

04:31.349 --> 04:31.929
Yeah.

04:31.949 --> 04:33.291
Well, it was curious.

04:33.471 --> 04:37.155
My background was curious.

04:38.165 --> 04:39.126
was quite curious.

04:40.188 --> 04:47.237
Well, professionally, did you describe yourself as a businessman?

04:48.058 --> 04:48.819
No, I was an engineer.

04:48.839 --> 04:51.382
I mean, I studied engineering in Cornell.

04:51.402 --> 04:54.767
What year did you graduate?

04:55.408 --> 04:55.768
I didn't.

04:58.752 --> 05:00.354
This is off the record.

05:02.116 --> 05:03.278
I was invited to leave

05:04.405 --> 05:11.613
And the deal was, if I left and didn't register the next term, they wouldn't try to prosecute me for grand theft.

05:12.434 --> 05:15.718
I stole all the toilet seats in the university the day before the alumni came up.

05:16.779 --> 05:19.502
They were very upset.

05:19.542 --> 05:21.464
They were smiling.

05:21.484 --> 05:25.389
Do you remember the pleasure or you had a reverberation?

05:25.429 --> 05:28.312
No, I remember nothing bad.

05:28.352 --> 05:31.155
The only time I've ever been...

05:31.743 --> 05:37.408
The only time I've ever been embarrassed, and that's something I will tell you about, is with something that I wound up at the HRC.

05:38.349 --> 05:39.670
That's a wonderful story.

05:39.690 --> 05:41.492
I really would like the HRC story.

05:41.632 --> 05:42.293
I will.

05:42.313 --> 05:42.453
Anyway.

05:43.414 --> 05:46.897
Of course, it's not only what I tell it to you, it's ongoing and continuing.

05:47.017 --> 05:49.379
Okay.

05:49.399 --> 05:58.628
Let me also say, parenthetically, that Mel Ellestine, you know, I told him, he applied for the HRC job, but he gave it to Tom Staley, and then he got to get it yet.

05:59.502 --> 06:14.927
Is this... When we get to it, I will give you the true quote to that story that you will regale, you will be omniscient knowing what I'm going to tell you.

06:14.967 --> 06:16.029
You think so?

06:16.289 --> 06:16.991
Okay.

06:17.011 --> 06:17.672
You're going to love it.

06:19.435 --> 06:20.236
Okay.

06:20.256 --> 06:21.899
You put all this stuff together, right?

06:21.919 --> 06:23.040
Yeah, we wouldn't buy that.

06:23.742 --> 06:24.042
So...

06:25.017 --> 06:26.258
Now, this is not pepperoni.

06:26.338 --> 06:27.460
This is like a cappuccola?

06:27.480 --> 06:27.760
What is it?

06:27.780 --> 06:28.721
Yeah, it's not cappuccola.

06:28.761 --> 06:30.503
It's a soprassata.

06:31.124 --> 06:32.986
Anyway, they make it right there.

06:34.087 --> 06:38.672
Wonderful.

06:38.692 --> 06:41.555
It's not particularly hot today, though.

06:43.017 --> 06:48.983
Anyway, so I started getting interested in Portugan prints.

06:53.553 --> 06:55.215
Must have been around 1958, 59.

06:56.677 --> 07:01.784
And I wanted to buy, I suddenly bought up on Quadra Pets.

07:01.804 --> 07:11.016
And the first books I ever bought that were collectible books, I went to an auction of the Sintas sale, Oscar Benjamin Sintas.

07:11.717 --> 07:12.458
Didn't know what the hell it was.

07:12.498 --> 07:13.139
I bought two books.

07:13.579 --> 07:14.701
They were cheap, 25 bucks.

07:15.522 --> 07:17.405
And I think I was in college at the time.

07:19.467 --> 07:22.311
And I would think the sale was probably 56 or 57.

07:23.692 --> 07:29.699
But I still have one of them.

07:29.719 --> 07:33.884
But shortly thereafter, I started finding out about Audubon and his work.

07:36.668 --> 07:45.198
Why do you have such a ... I've got to type this, so I don't want to say it.

07:45.238 --> 07:47.420
Why do you have such a fascination for Audubon?

07:47.440 --> 07:48.822
I didn't.

07:51.468 --> 07:54.333
But, no, you mentioned him at least three or four times now.

07:54.433 --> 07:57.619
Well, this started, you asked me how I got into the collecting.

08:02.327 --> 08:13.746
There's an aspect of collecting that has to do, in the beginning, with... Keep going, this is not very good, I just want to get it.

08:18.974 --> 08:22.298
concepts of, let's say, value.

08:22.778 --> 08:23.679
Concepts of value.

08:28.144 --> 08:44.442
My feeling is that people who are collectors, who have advanced states of the disease, are incapable of not

08:49.062 --> 09:16.926
using their eyes to measure value in abstract or relative terms, whatever it may be, whether it's a woman's body, whether it's a car, whether it's a picture on the wall, whether it's the price of a meal, whatever it is, there is a type of mentality, a type of mindset that if you say to me, for example,

09:17.817 --> 09:23.203
I just bought this tie for five bucks.

09:24.084 --> 09:32.174
Somehow or other, I will immediately register.

09:32.194 --> 09:39.362
I'm incapable of not registering somewhere in my mind mechanism.

09:40.163 --> 09:43.487
You paid too much, you paid the right price, or you got a bargain.

09:44.564 --> 09:45.746
It was undervalued.

09:45.806 --> 09:47.890
It doesn't matter whatever it may be.

09:47.990 --> 09:54.661
It's a totally unfocused mechanism, but it's there all the time.

09:54.681 --> 09:55.823
You measure value.

09:56.144 --> 10:08.445
And I think that true collectors at some point go through this and are constantly defining what is value, what is the nature of collecting, why do you

10:10.450 --> 10:15.638
go out and fund $25,000 for a fucking book like Moby Dick, okay?

10:16.399 --> 10:20.125
So when somebody copied without the title page and invoiced it to me, one ragged dick.

10:21.527 --> 10:29.239
But I'm saying, why do you go and spend $25,000 for a book?

10:29.259 --> 10:32.965
What is it in the human...

10:34.143 --> 10:50.302
mind, makeup, that people who don't have illimitable funds, because illimitable funds corrupt or take away the pleasure of discretionary choice of money.

10:56.349 --> 11:02.817
When you have something that you're willing to shell out,

11:03.168 --> 11:07.433
It's just the amount of money for it.

11:07.453 --> 11:11.237
Or you have a shelf of books in there that's three feet wide.

11:11.257 --> 11:12.238
It's worth more than your house.

11:14.661 --> 11:19.366
And you're not a guy who's got 50 or 500 million dollars.

11:20.087 --> 11:21.328
You're a guy who's making a living.

11:22.189 --> 11:23.511
And who comes?

11:24.271 --> 11:24.812
What?

11:25.513 --> 11:26.194
We got two.

11:26.414 --> 11:27.475
There's a cup in the cabinet.

11:27.495 --> 11:29.277
You can wash it out in the toilet.

11:36.344 --> 11:43.511
point that I'm getting at is why do people spend money?

11:43.551 --> 11:51.519
I'm getting off on a very... I also think that, you know, we can be vague about this, but I don't think that there are bad results and means, however.

11:51.619 --> 11:54.562
But even so, my means are relatively... Yes, that's true.

11:54.782 --> 11:58.326
Yes, but my means are still relatively limited.

12:01.248 --> 12:06.013
Certainly, they are far more precarious than many other people, and I, you know,

12:06.247 --> 12:07.649
But that's irrelevant.

12:07.669 --> 12:08.511
Oh, I think it's relevant.

12:10.073 --> 12:11.375
The means of this, okay?

12:11.395 --> 12:14.420
Have you ever gone hungry because of purchasing books?

12:14.500 --> 12:15.141
Oh, sure.

12:16.143 --> 12:16.464
Sure.

12:18.928 --> 12:24.156
I once, when I was, I remember at one time there was a... Absolutely.

12:24.176 --> 12:25.118
Well, that's it.

12:25.138 --> 12:25.999
Yeah, I'm curious.

12:26.921 --> 12:28.243
You actually went hungry.

12:28.303 --> 12:30.927
You actually deprived yourself of some human need.

12:30.947 --> 12:32.710
Well, let me tell you the story, okay?

12:32.960 --> 12:39.048
When I was first married, my wife was working as a teacher, and I was struggling, trying to get a business going.

12:39.749 --> 12:49.381
And there used to be, I lived in my plans at the time, and there was a thrift shop, Federated Jewish, a thrift shop or something.

12:50.122 --> 12:51.124
And they had a painting.

12:51.785 --> 12:56.270
I used to buy crap there, nice things, but they had a painting on the wall, a painting they wanted 100 bucks for.

12:56.991 --> 13:01.397
So I offered them, I think at the time, 15 dollars.

13:02.238 --> 13:04.702
And they laughed, and they said, no, blah, blah, blah.

13:04.742 --> 13:05.864
Got a glass?

13:05.884 --> 13:09.649
So I kept going back, because I was on the way home from work.

13:11.111 --> 13:18.142
I used to drive in, I used to take the train home and what have you, and I'd go by.

13:18.523 --> 13:20.326
And for six months, the price was $100.

13:20.626 --> 13:22.309
Then they finally dropped it to $75.

13:23.470 --> 13:28.218
And after about a year, they were dropped at $5 and $10 a week or a month or what have you.

13:28.578 --> 13:31.182
I finally walked in there one day, and they said, Mr. Zimmer,

13:31.735 --> 13:32.576
Finally, you got it.

13:32.896 --> 13:33.677
It's $15.

13:33.697 --> 13:35.319
I said, I'll give you $10.

13:35.439 --> 13:38.743
And they wouldn't sell it.

13:38.864 --> 13:40.005
So I was thinking about it.

13:40.025 --> 13:43.669
I was going down to my... Did you buy it for the $15?

13:43.689 --> 13:43.750
No.

13:43.770 --> 13:45.452
I said, I'll give you $10.

13:45.472 --> 13:47.394
Did you give me $15 a year ago?

13:47.414 --> 13:52.040
Anyway, that weekend, I'm going down to visit my parents.

13:53.441 --> 13:54.022
I'm with my wife.

13:54.082 --> 13:54.983
I stopped off there.

13:55.003 --> 13:56.385
I decide I'll pay the $15 or what have you.

13:56.685 --> 13:58.628
I go in and I buy the pension for $15.

13:58.928 --> 13:59.869
I put it in the car.

14:00.963 --> 14:03.185
My wife says, what did you do?

14:05.007 --> 14:06.448
I said, I just bought this painting.

14:08.590 --> 14:09.951
And she became hysterical.

14:11.493 --> 14:15.056
She said, we have a disconnect notice from the phone.

14:15.076 --> 14:16.938
We have a dispossessed notice from the landlord.

14:16.958 --> 14:18.579
We're three months behind in our rent.

14:18.599 --> 14:19.540
We can't pay our phone.

14:19.560 --> 14:20.321
We can't pay our rent.

14:20.341 --> 14:21.582
We can't pay our electricity.

14:21.843 --> 14:22.163
We can't.

14:22.223 --> 14:23.244
And you're buying paintings?

14:23.264 --> 14:23.904
I said, yeah.

14:24.545 --> 14:25.206
It was cruel.

14:25.226 --> 14:26.567
So yeah.

14:26.947 --> 14:27.488
Nice painting.

14:28.929 --> 14:29.209
It was OK.

14:29.229 --> 14:29.890
I still got it.

14:30.359 --> 14:31.961
That was my next question.

14:31.981 --> 14:33.363
What is it?

14:33.383 --> 14:36.026
A pleasant painting.

14:36.046 --> 14:36.707
My daughter likes it.

14:36.727 --> 14:37.248
I'll give it to her.

14:37.368 --> 14:38.609
An American painting?

14:38.649 --> 14:39.090
Probably.

14:39.130 --> 14:40.732
It's a nondescript painting.

14:40.812 --> 14:42.014
It's a pretty painting.

14:42.174 --> 14:44.396
Is it a pastoral scene?

14:44.937 --> 14:46.179
It's a pastoral scene.

14:46.219 --> 14:47.120
Winter scene of trees.

14:47.861 --> 14:50.784
Me too.

14:50.804 --> 14:54.970
But what I'm getting at is, sure, I'll spend money for books.

14:55.430 --> 14:56.151
I'll spend money.

14:56.191 --> 15:00.096
I've spent hundreds of thousands of dollars

15:00.464 --> 15:27.518
books but to buy a car oh yes hmm at what point did you did you to do it's like the guy who wakes up one day and says i am an alcoholic i'm going through the process um the i know something at what point did you say i'm i'm really possessed i'm obsessed i am driven

15:28.139 --> 15:29.300
When did I admit it?

15:29.360 --> 15:30.621
When did I admit it to myself?

15:30.701 --> 15:32.223
I was doing something quite irrational.

15:32.383 --> 15:36.126
When did I admit it to myself, or when did I admit it to myself verbally irrational?

15:36.146 --> 15:36.567
Well, whatever.

15:36.587 --> 15:39.249
I'd kind of like to know anything about the process.

15:39.269 --> 15:39.589
Okay.

15:39.609 --> 15:40.590
The process is this.

15:45.475 --> 15:56.965
When I started... It's hard to really, I think, to focus or to...

15:59.037 --> 16:22.497
identify that with me but i think it was why because it was an evolutionary sort of thing because there were other competition it was competitive there were competitive demands okay there's competitive demands for time space and money wives um friends uh family or food

16:24.029 --> 16:25.752
You say white, that's plural, I guess.

16:25.952 --> 16:32.082
No, it's the... Well, yes.

16:32.242 --> 16:33.203
Yes, thank you.

16:34.185 --> 16:40.375
Anyway, the point I'm getting at is that... Well, I would just ask that question.

16:40.595 --> 16:45.663
I've talked to people who have lost families because of the obsession of the book.

16:46.004 --> 16:47.506
Of course, it does have a reason.

16:47.526 --> 16:51.893
I'm just trying to find out how often you've been married or how long you've been married.

16:52.312 --> 16:58.940
You did tell me an anecdote about a painting and the wife went crazy over the, you know... Yeah, but she's still my wife.

17:00.281 --> 17:01.482
Well, there you have it.

17:01.502 --> 17:01.743
That's good.

17:01.763 --> 17:02.844
That's an understanding of the wife.

17:03.244 --> 17:06.849
Yeah, you betcha she's understanding.

17:06.869 --> 17:08.671
Anyway, he's my father.

17:12.335 --> 17:16.359
Father's my daughter.

17:16.379 --> 17:17.240
He's also at Leavelin.

17:17.261 --> 17:17.761
You met the wife?

17:18.482 --> 17:20.344
No, I didn't met the wife.

17:21.151 --> 17:32.584
Look, I started collecting art before I started collecting books.

17:33.185 --> 17:35.808
Then I continued to collect art and collect books.

17:36.769 --> 17:40.894
Then I continued to collect a little more books than art.

17:41.675 --> 17:51.006
Then, when I was collecting books, the evolution of me, of my collection, my focus, went from

17:53.821 --> 18:00.427
the idea of Audubon and the anger that Audubon's animals were underappreciated.

18:00.447 --> 18:07.053
I was angry that I could buy a painting or a folio print of Audubon for five bucks.

18:07.314 --> 18:09.576
Because it was a rat.

18:10.517 --> 18:15.161
Then I started asking, where were the originals of all of these things?

18:15.641 --> 18:18.444
Because what you have, you know, the original that they're talking about is a print.

18:18.884 --> 18:19.545
Where are the originals?

18:19.965 --> 18:22.748
Then I started looking around to try to buy the original studies

18:22.947 --> 18:46.643
natural history and i started buying some of those and that sort of you know competed with uh my desire to buy books you know you buy a painting the painting's a good answer much more so you know you're going to buy now as it turned out as far as i was dealing i'm sure a little light is flicking okay let's not look

18:50.977 --> 18:51.698
It's flicking.

18:51.818 --> 18:52.839
It's flicking.

18:54.481 --> 19:04.351
Anyway, I went from collecting Audubon to collecting natural history as a general focus.

19:04.431 --> 19:09.357
You can always buy a few books here or there because you're a junkie anyway.

19:09.377 --> 19:17.946
I then decided I wanted to collect American natural history because I found a good reference to it by maximizing over the book on American natural history references.

19:18.533 --> 19:22.840
And I started getting rid of my European natural history and collecting more and more money.

19:22.860 --> 19:23.301
Getting rid of how?

19:23.321 --> 19:23.481
Selling.

19:23.501 --> 19:26.205
I'd sell to dealers who I could then buy.

19:26.225 --> 19:27.467
Did you take a loss?

19:27.487 --> 19:28.689
No, I generally made a lot of money.

19:29.110 --> 19:35.240
As a collector, I have made a great deal of money in my books.

19:35.260 --> 19:37.443
That's very interesting.

19:37.463 --> 19:39.767
Most collectors get screwed.

19:39.927 --> 19:42.531
Most collectors collect for different reasons than I do.

19:44.254 --> 19:46.077
I would say to you that

19:47.710 --> 20:05.546
The collectors who collect for reasons other than prestige generally are extremely successful in measuring.

20:06.147 --> 20:15.355
If one measures success by you make money when you sell it, whether you deal it or do other things with it,

20:16.145 --> 20:36.964
The people who collect books with some reason not to flip them for a profit or with some focus to what they're collecting and some knowledge, it's time and grade.

20:37.184 --> 20:42.109
I spent a lot of time and a lot of money and a lot of effort collecting books.

20:42.209 --> 20:44.751
If I measure the value of my time economically,

20:46.807 --> 20:52.675
that I spend with my books, my book collection costs me a lot of money.

20:52.695 --> 21:04.131
If my income is arbitrarily, as an employee, quarter of a million dollars a year, and I spend 50% of my time... Well, you're not an employee, you're not a company.

21:04.151 --> 21:04.752
It doesn't matter.

21:04.772 --> 21:10.099
I don't own the company, but I'm an editor of the company, but it's still a book.

21:10.119 --> 21:14.485
If my value, my professional value is this, then

21:16.304 --> 21:28.439
If I spend 50% of my time with books, then I have to add to the cost of what I buy the alternate value of my time.

21:28.799 --> 21:39.792
So that people who tell you that if I buy so many books or so many dollars, you have corporate overhead.

21:39.832 --> 21:44.758
One could impute this sort of value, but that's the pleasure of living.

21:45.920 --> 21:58.622
But still in all, what I was getting at is that when I got done collecting, or when I started to shift in area of collecting, I generally was able to dispose of what I collected at a significant profit.

21:58.982 --> 22:00.104
Mainly through dealers?

22:00.385 --> 22:00.625
Yes.

22:00.905 --> 22:06.375
That's pretty good, because dealers will factor in their own markup.

22:07.497 --> 22:08.799
Mainly through dealers.

22:08.859 --> 22:11.303
And I would give a dealer, I mean, Quaritch, for example,

22:11.992 --> 22:17.497
I used to go into one side of Quark and give them my natural history books and go to the other side and buy them out of Americana.

22:17.517 --> 22:19.399
So you go to London to buy books, do you think?

22:19.559 --> 22:21.621
I have quite often.

22:21.641 --> 22:22.262
Regularly.

22:25.665 --> 22:26.927
Could buy American in France?

22:29.429 --> 22:29.709
Yeah.

22:31.091 --> 22:33.493
I don't go to Paris to buy American in London.

22:34.794 --> 22:40.480
Although now, most of them, it's very inefficient to do it.

22:41.422 --> 22:44.425
I wasn't buying American imprints necessarily, I was buying natural history.

22:45.406 --> 22:46.507
So I'm buying natural history.

22:51.853 --> 22:57.138
Then I switched over to American natural history.

22:57.238 --> 23:02.384
Then I switched over to voyages and travels.

23:03.765 --> 23:05.887
Which is really a lovely thing.

23:05.907 --> 23:07.449
Commenting on natural history.

23:07.649 --> 23:09.471
I picked up your cook stuff.

23:12.083 --> 23:19.514
I mean, I've had Columbus letters.

23:21.376 --> 23:22.678
Yeah, I got rid of them.

23:22.698 --> 23:35.256
What happened was, I went from autobahn to natural history, to American natural history, to voyages and travels commenting on natural history,

23:35.827 --> 23:38.130
The voyages and travels in Americana to the New World.

23:38.551 --> 23:40.874
Did this reflect changes in your life?

23:41.395 --> 23:43.938
No, just to... Changes in your intellectual development?

23:43.978 --> 23:45.941
Did this reflect changes in interest?

23:45.961 --> 23:47.903
Did you become void with earlier things?

23:48.845 --> 23:49.746
To some degree, yes.

23:50.527 --> 23:52.810
There's other areas... All of the above.

23:52.830 --> 23:53.811
Yes, to a degree.

23:53.831 --> 23:58.177
They were all less than satisfying or continuing to be satisfying over a long period of time.

23:59.319 --> 24:03.184
One of the other factors that came into play is that if you anticipate a market...

24:04.328 --> 24:09.895
or an area of interest, then you buy at a certain level.

24:11.618 --> 24:14.562
If other people... Maybe before the interest is there.

24:15.082 --> 24:15.863
Whatever, whatever.

24:16.024 --> 24:18.747
Being precocious, in other words.

24:18.767 --> 24:20.309
Determining... Opportunistic.

24:20.670 --> 24:24.836
I started buying natural history, let's say, when natural history was ignored.

24:25.977 --> 24:33.407
Now, so long as it was ignored, you get into a situation where you're willing to pay certain chips for certain things.

24:34.045 --> 24:35.707
Now, if I was buying... Certain chips?

24:35.727 --> 24:38.050
Yeah, economic chips, units, or whatever you want to call it.

24:38.070 --> 24:41.775
If I'm buying quadruple... My type is chips, and it's C-H-I-P-N.

24:41.795 --> 24:49.525
If I buy, if I'm collecting, and one of the things I did was I always collected multiple.

24:49.545 --> 24:56.734
One of the ways I've always looked or moved into an area of collecting is I've always wanted action, as opposed to quality.

24:56.895 --> 24:57.435
Quality.

24:57.656 --> 24:59.218
I wanted quality instead of quality.

24:59.258 --> 25:00.800
You know what I was saying when I said quality?

25:00.860 --> 25:01.140
Yeah.

25:02.562 --> 25:03.343
That's how we got.

25:03.442 --> 25:03.803
I know.

25:04.864 --> 25:08.310
Anyway, but I'm saying to you, I wanted quality instead of quality.

25:09.151 --> 25:17.105
And I wanted to handle... Okay, the difference is this, that I believe collecting is an educated process.

25:17.585 --> 25:21.091
And one of the satisfying ways of dealing with it is handling things.

25:21.171 --> 25:22.514
You've got to handle the goods.

25:22.854 --> 25:29.365
If you handle it tactically, objectively, you know, visually, you learn to discriminate between...

25:30.104 --> 25:30.605
Factorily.

25:30.745 --> 25:31.407
Mole factorily.

25:31.427 --> 25:32.610
Mole factorily too.

25:32.690 --> 25:32.971
Smell it.

25:32.991 --> 25:33.592
You betcha.

25:34.233 --> 25:36.338
I can let you smell some shit I'd want too.

25:37.822 --> 25:40.808
To me, I think that's interject.

25:41.330 --> 25:43.815
A woman wrote a book about the senses and a guy went blind.

25:43.855 --> 25:44.637
He loved his book.

25:45.022 --> 25:46.224
Story about that in the Times today.

25:46.244 --> 25:46.865
It was an article.

25:47.105 --> 25:47.606
Okay.

25:47.927 --> 25:49.169
Today's book review.

25:49.269 --> 25:52.714
Oh, well, the book on the... Some woman, some cunt.

25:52.794 --> 25:53.676
Yeah, she's wonderful.

25:53.716 --> 25:58.764
She let a bat go through her hair or something like that?

25:58.784 --> 25:59.245
Let me ask you.

25:59.265 --> 26:01.849
But anyway, she told me about this guy who went blind, loved his books.

26:02.209 --> 26:05.555
He learned to identify every book in the library by smell.

26:06.316 --> 26:07.157
Is that a great story?

26:08.099 --> 26:09.080
Is that a great story?

26:10.883 --> 26:12.025
It's not a bad story, is it?

26:12.224 --> 26:15.528
I'm just going to get in my book, I can tell you that.

26:16.789 --> 26:18.151
Go ahead, I'm sorry.

26:18.171 --> 26:20.233
I don't even know where we were, but that was my mistake.

26:20.453 --> 26:21.274
Interview was there.

26:23.557 --> 26:29.343
We're talking about a focus of collecting.

26:29.363 --> 26:37.592
Some collectors are passive collectors and want to have form for them a collection, neat, fastidious, and elegant, which is fine.

26:37.612 --> 26:38.413
These are collections.

26:38.513 --> 26:41.657
I guess what I'm drawing again, I don't mean to interrupt, but...

26:43.493 --> 26:47.498
I want to know what you get out of the collection personally.

26:47.518 --> 26:48.019
Do you know it?

26:48.379 --> 26:49.661
Do you feel it?

26:49.681 --> 26:50.482
Do you read it?

26:50.502 --> 26:51.563
Do you absorb it?

26:51.603 --> 26:57.150
What does it do for you other than acquisition and possession?

26:57.170 --> 26:58.692
Okay.

26:58.712 --> 27:00.574
I have no possessive instinct.

27:00.595 --> 27:04.079
I don't believe it.

27:04.740 --> 27:08.364
I have no possessive instinct.

27:08.444 --> 27:11.048
Let's identify him if it's all right.

27:11.128 --> 27:12.910
William Miller, a pedagogue.

27:15.455 --> 27:17.298
I mean, you say this knowing him.

27:19.301 --> 27:21.264
You say he is not possessive in any way.

27:21.504 --> 27:25.190
But the man is a biblio maniac.

27:28.896 --> 27:29.317
Big difference.

27:30.058 --> 27:39.252
I don't... You said he is a preservationist and a compiler.

27:40.328 --> 27:42.830
And we don't believe, therefore, we need to collect it as well.

27:43.471 --> 27:44.952
No, not possessive.

27:45.052 --> 27:46.393
Possessive.

27:47.334 --> 27:48.455
You say possessive.

27:48.695 --> 27:49.396
You see.

27:49.416 --> 27:50.056
Possessive.

27:50.076 --> 27:51.397
I have a sense of my book.

27:51.838 --> 27:53.659
This is my book.

27:53.980 --> 27:56.181
This is not my book.

27:56.201 --> 27:56.422
Possessive.

27:56.442 --> 27:57.342
This is something that I'm using at the time.

27:57.362 --> 27:58.884
You are a custodian?

27:59.024 --> 28:00.225
Yeah.

28:00.245 --> 28:02.947
Passing along.

28:02.967 --> 28:05.729
But not simply a custodian.

28:06.830 --> 28:07.331
The process.

28:07.731 --> 28:09.813
Do I ever go over the hill?

28:09.853 --> 28:09.913
No!

28:10.417 --> 28:12.560
William Miller.

28:12.700 --> 28:21.834
How do you know Michael?

28:21.934 --> 28:23.517
I'm just curious.

28:23.897 --> 28:24.638
We met at a bookshop.

28:24.719 --> 28:26.081
I was looking to buy a building.

28:26.121 --> 28:29.566
But you seem to have an understanding of the book for us.

28:29.606 --> 28:34.053
No, I'll tell you an excellent story that describes both ends of what we're talking about.

28:34.073 --> 28:35.435
You seem to have some insight.

28:35.455 --> 28:36.897
I'm standing in a bookshop in Hastings.

28:37.130 --> 28:45.624
I'm looking across the street at a building that is for sale, talking to the owner of the shop where I'm social.

28:47.507 --> 28:50.873
We are talking about what this building is worth and if it's worth doing.

28:50.953 --> 28:53.758
It's like a 10-unit building or something like that.

28:54.078 --> 29:02.412
As I'm standing there with my hands in my pocket, a guy walks up to me, stands next to me, looks at the building, looks at me, looks at the building, says, Hey, what do you think?

29:06.458 --> 29:07.599
do a little of this, do a little of that.

29:08.000 --> 29:08.801
I'd make some money on it.

29:09.982 --> 29:10.563
You got the money?

29:12.084 --> 29:13.105
I said, no, I don't have the money.

29:14.127 --> 29:15.528
My name is Zinman, come and see me.

29:19.593 --> 29:21.495
That's how it started.

29:21.515 --> 29:31.606
Out there, in the universe at present, there are littered remains of the course of human events.

29:31.626 --> 29:35.250
Some people come along and curry

29:35.618 --> 29:57.390
those littered remains specialities they farm when you're finished farming and you harvest yourself sometimes you eat sometimes you keep often you sell that's what this process is in this case to a great degree there's a little of this there's a little of that there's a little of that

30:00.020 --> 30:01.702
Until you put it together.

30:02.043 --> 30:04.506
Then once it is together, then it becomes appreciated.

30:04.526 --> 30:06.289
Those parts are greater than less.

30:06.309 --> 30:07.831
How long have you known Michael?

30:07.851 --> 30:09.413
Ten years, 12 years, 15 years.

30:09.433 --> 30:10.234
You studied him?

30:10.254 --> 30:11.676
You studied him?

30:11.696 --> 30:14.340
It sounded like you studied him.

30:14.400 --> 30:16.223
Not as a laboratory animal.

30:17.224 --> 30:22.832
I mean, as an example of human behavior.

30:22.952 --> 30:26.417
I know him.

30:26.597 --> 30:28.440
But I don't think that's unique to Michael.

30:29.348 --> 30:30.529
There are many collectors.

30:37.037 --> 30:38.738
But there are many collectors like that.

30:38.979 --> 30:40.921
Collector dealers, that's the difference.

30:41.041 --> 30:48.810
I mean, before you were talking about collectors, you were talking about people I've never known, and I know a lot of book people.

30:49.070 --> 30:53.835
These seem to be... Oh, Colin Franklin is a collector dealer.

30:53.855 --> 30:53.995
Yeah.

30:54.015 --> 30:55.938
All the bookmen are collector dealers.

30:55.958 --> 30:56.939
This didn't get on the tape.

30:56.959 --> 30:59.001
I said, Leonard, he's showing these collectors.

30:59.150 --> 31:02.955
I said, why did you sell them?

31:03.035 --> 31:12.726
And I said, he goes like this and says, that's nothing going on the tape.

31:12.887 --> 31:14.008
He says, money.

31:14.629 --> 31:25.562
The point is this, that for whatever compelling reason I have to collect

31:26.757 --> 31:27.798
It's not to possess.

31:28.018 --> 31:29.640
Possessing is irrelevant.

31:29.960 --> 31:30.821
It's the action.

31:32.603 --> 31:37.829
Well, Vic Manning says he gave up gambling to collect.

31:38.089 --> 31:38.409
Quote.

31:38.489 --> 31:43.415
He said he loved the baccarat games, he loved the table games, and he was a heavy gambler.

31:44.416 --> 31:46.758
This guy had an interview with John Larroquette.

31:47.679 --> 31:50.102
He gave up booze to become a collector.

31:50.122 --> 31:55.127
So it was kind of like taking one passion and kind of making it more productive.

31:55.580 --> 31:59.987
This is not what I'm suggesting that you've done in any way like that.

32:01.108 --> 32:08.679
Look, like every other messianic asshole, you look for a cause that is just.

32:10.182 --> 32:21.819
I simply, being a collector and accumulating and having the fun, the pleasure that I got was in the act of collecting.

32:23.161 --> 32:23.662
The hunt?

32:23.682 --> 32:23.882
Yeah.

32:24.773 --> 32:27.636
the treasure hunting, just the fun of collecting.

32:30.099 --> 32:34.345
The possessing of the book, as pleasurable as it is, is transitory.

32:36.948 --> 32:54.409
I have, if I'm no longer active, I had probably the, I collected at one time stamps, and the stamps that I collected were revenue stamps, tax paid revenues, and I had a very formidable collection, probably the best collection of beer stamps, of tax paid beer stamps around, and I loved them.

32:55.368 --> 33:02.158
When I decided that books were overwhelming this area of my interest, I didn't pack them away.

33:02.178 --> 33:03.320
I dumped them.

33:04.421 --> 33:10.630
Because if it wasn't alive, I wasn't locking it up and putting it away.

33:11.191 --> 33:15.036
Let me address an apparent contradiction.

33:16.318 --> 33:16.759
Apparent.

33:17.480 --> 33:25.071
And it only goes back to something we were talking about, which I'll raise, and then we can discuss both of you.

33:25.287 --> 33:36.077
You mentioned, as we were talking, that you probably own the finest collections anywhere outside of an institution of American interests.

33:37.678 --> 33:39.460
Is that a fair statement?

33:40.661 --> 33:40.901
Yes.

33:41.502 --> 33:42.903
Certainly the largest.

33:43.023 --> 33:44.865
Okay.

33:45.485 --> 33:47.707
And certainly the most important.

33:47.727 --> 33:49.449
Well, maybe you haven't.

33:49.469 --> 33:51.351
That's not necessarily the finest.

33:51.431 --> 33:51.991
Okay.

33:52.011 --> 33:52.932
Well, what's the difference?

33:53.148 --> 33:59.296
I look at finest as... Fine, I don't mean in terms of condition.

33:59.516 --> 34:05.264
I look at fine in terms of quality, condition, significance.

34:06.766 --> 34:16.779
Now, I don't own, for example, I don't think I own many of the great high spots of American imprints.

34:17.160 --> 34:18.862
I don't have a Bay Songbook.

34:18.882 --> 34:19.583
I don't have a 1648.

34:19.663 --> 34:22.547
It is 13 or 11th.

34:22.763 --> 34:26.669
I don't have a 1648 Cambridge platform.

34:26.689 --> 34:33.739
I got two 1671 Cambridge platforms and four 1680 Cambridge platforms, but the 16471s are all defective in some way.

34:33.779 --> 34:35.040
Is that just you all right?

34:36.142 --> 34:36.202
No.

34:36.222 --> 34:37.364
Not at all.

34:37.384 --> 34:45.295
But there are many people who have, for example, beautiful copies of the Eliot Bible.

34:45.460 --> 34:49.845
Why don't you point out parenthetically that you own three Elliott Bibles?

34:49.865 --> 34:53.508
I own three Elliott Bibles, but I own three second editions, only half of the first edition.

34:54.950 --> 35:01.196
So if you were to have a want list, I don't know if you have a want list, a first Elliott Bible will be yours.

35:01.376 --> 35:05.100
Oh, sure, but only I can buy one tomorrow, but I don't want to spend 400 grand for it.

35:07.423 --> 35:11.106
What would you pay for it?

35:11.126 --> 35:11.867
Between you and me?

35:12.568 --> 35:14.590
I would probably, if it was perfect,

35:14.755 --> 35:16.096
I probably wouldn't be a buyer.

35:16.116 --> 35:24.265
No, I probably wouldn't be a buyer because I think that the premium that it would take to get a perfect copy would be something that I wouldn't want to spend.

35:24.385 --> 35:31.312
But if it was lacking a couple of leaves, I'd like to buy one for about a hundred, a hundred and a quarter.

35:31.332 --> 35:37.718
I'm told that conditions of importance is not essential to you.

35:37.738 --> 35:38.639
Yes, you could say that.

35:39.380 --> 35:42.383
I mean, if you buy things that other people might ask,

35:42.852 --> 35:45.556
Because it is not the... Less and less.

35:47.199 --> 35:50.424
Not that I won't continue to buy them, but less and less that other people will pass.

35:52.367 --> 36:00.860
The idea of perfect or less than perfect in the book business was very much irrationally ascribed to the business of pregnant or not pregnant.

36:01.120 --> 36:01.922
They were absolutes.

36:03.464 --> 36:11.256
And whatever basis the booksellers chose to implicate this in the industry or in the area of collectors,

36:11.995 --> 36:13.077
They successfully did it.

36:13.617 --> 36:27.758
If a book was worth $1,000, the same book, you know, in fine condition, the same book lacking the leaf, the last leaf, for example, was worth $75.

36:29.360 --> 36:37.732
You see much of this today in American fiction, modern American fiction.

36:37.832 --> 36:38.273
Let's check.

36:38.607 --> 36:40.389
Not only dust jackets, but condition.

36:40.870 --> 36:44.894
You take a book that's in vogue, for example, The Murphy's Falcon.

36:48.258 --> 36:54.325
A first edition without a dust jacket today is probably going to be on the market for, I would say, $600 to $1,000.

36:55.827 --> 36:59.552
In poor condition, it's probably $75, or fair condition.

36:59.592 --> 37:02.455
In poor condition, it's $25.

37:05.371 --> 37:06.612
But people read these things.

37:06.853 --> 37:09.035
They're not meant to be treasured and strode.

37:09.576 --> 37:13.560
And the same thing when you have a dust jacket that's worth, you know, seven grand, ten grand, or what have you.

37:14.121 --> 37:15.122
That's irrational.

37:15.362 --> 37:29.538
It's not irrational, but it is a premium that I'm not prepared to pay because I have finite sums of money to buy in a universe that will consume my money.

37:29.939 --> 37:32.301
Would you pay a book for a book for it?

37:32.321 --> 37:32.662
Oh, sure.

37:32.682 --> 37:32.982
So what?

37:34.278 --> 37:35.519
But others would pay a lot more.

37:36.740 --> 37:38.141
I'd like to buy it for like $35.

37:38.321 --> 37:45.468
I mean, the Elliott Bible I bought, I bought three Elliott Bibles, one at auction and two from dealers.

37:46.568 --> 37:51.873
And the last one I bought, I bought this year, and it cost me $8,500.

37:52.173 --> 37:57.498
And it's a wonderful and instructive story about the book world.

37:58.539 --> 38:03.643
The book was brought to the California Book Fair.

38:04.703 --> 38:09.429
And the dealer called me up Sunday night after he came back from the fair and said, would you be interested?

38:09.449 --> 38:10.831
You know, would you have been interested?

38:10.891 --> 38:13.214
Would you have been interested in an Elliott Parable?

38:13.234 --> 38:14.135
I said, I would have been.

38:14.595 --> 38:14.856
Why?

38:15.516 --> 38:17.058
I saw one in California.

38:17.078 --> 38:18.160
I said, was it at the book fair?

38:18.180 --> 38:18.700
He said, yes.

38:19.962 --> 38:21.404
I said, how much was it?

38:21.804 --> 38:22.745
And how complete was it?

38:22.765 --> 38:26.250
He said, he thought it was lacking a couple of leaves, the title page and maybe some of the leaves.

38:27.251 --> 38:28.573
I said, how much was it?

38:28.593 --> 38:31.817
He said, he thought it was like $7,500 or $8,000.

38:34.300 --> 38:34.660
I said,

38:35.770 --> 38:37.493
simply inconceivable.

38:37.573 --> 38:46.546
It is impermissible that an Elliott Bible went through the California Book Fair at eight grand and didn't get bought.

38:47.307 --> 38:49.751
He says, it was there with the fair closed.

38:52.214 --> 38:54.217
And... What was this thing?

38:54.818 --> 38:56.120
Check out?

38:56.461 --> 38:58.744
Wait, I couldn't believe me.

38:58.784 --> 38:59.765
I couldn't believe it.

39:00.527 --> 39:02.329
And I said, well, if you get it, I'm interested.

39:02.349 --> 39:03.371
He called up the dealer.

39:03.391 --> 39:04.933
He said it was being shipped back.

39:05.453 --> 39:09.397
to him and have it, and I went through this whole bizarre world.

39:09.517 --> 39:11.259
I'm surprised you didn't fly up to California.

39:11.279 --> 39:14.402
Wait, you don't have to do things like that necessarily, but you're right, okay?

39:14.782 --> 39:20.768
And back and forth, and it's more preposterous, more preposterous every day.

39:21.589 --> 39:24.732
One day, the guy calls me and says, I got the book.

39:24.752 --> 39:27.174
This is a book dealer in New York.

39:27.194 --> 39:28.936
So I say, bring it up.

39:28.956 --> 39:29.596
He says, I can't.

39:29.636 --> 39:30.477
My car broke down.

39:30.497 --> 39:31.278
I only had one car.

39:31.298 --> 39:32.139
My wife was using it.

39:32.159 --> 39:32.659
I'll come out.

39:32.679 --> 39:33.580
No, don't come out.

39:33.861 --> 39:35.342
And it goes on and on like this.

39:35.862 --> 39:38.645
Two days later, he walks in and hands me the book.

39:39.246 --> 39:40.067
He says, there it is.

39:40.648 --> 39:43.411
And all of these thoughts that I had, I couldn't understand.

39:43.431 --> 39:45.233
I mean, it certainly defied logic.

39:45.313 --> 39:46.975
I couldn't understand this.

39:46.995 --> 39:47.836
There's the book.

39:47.856 --> 39:50.559
He says, look, it's lacking an extra page, which I didn't mind.

39:50.899 --> 39:53.282
And I think I bought it for $9,000.

39:53.562 --> 39:55.525
He paid $8,000, and I bought it for $9,000.

39:55.545 --> 39:55.965
You got it?

39:56.125 --> 39:56.646
Yeah, I bought it.

39:56.666 --> 39:57.247
I got it.

39:57.287 --> 39:57.887
It's over here.

39:58.288 --> 40:00.290
Now, the point I'm saying was... How long ago is this?

40:01.151 --> 40:02.913
The California Book Fair in February.

40:02.933 --> 40:03.454
This year?

40:03.474 --> 40:03.574
Yeah.

40:04.010 --> 40:13.745
So I said to him, it's not that I'm doubting you, and I certainly believe everything you say.

40:13.765 --> 40:15.248
Can you check it out pretty good?

40:15.368 --> 40:15.628
Yes.

40:15.969 --> 40:17.291
It's exactly what you want.

40:17.491 --> 40:19.094
It's the best copy I have.

40:20.195 --> 40:21.738
In the original binding and everything.

40:21.758 --> 40:24.642
So I said to him, that's what I said.

40:24.803 --> 40:26.305
I said, how did this happen?

40:26.909 --> 40:29.193
He says, well... This is supposed to be L.A.

40:29.213 --> 40:33.380
This is supposed to be... He says, well, the book dealer had it on consignment from someone.

40:33.400 --> 40:33.901
He brought it.

40:34.202 --> 40:39.270
He put it in a box and put it under the cabinet because he didn't get around to displaying it.

40:39.531 --> 40:43.838
And I was there and I pulled out the box and I opened it up and there it was.

40:43.818 --> 40:45.200
So it was never displayed.

40:45.220 --> 40:46.020
It was never displayed.

40:46.040 --> 40:51.607
But the thing is that this book dealer, this schmuck, brings the goddamn book to the fair and doesn't display it.

40:51.647 --> 40:52.227
And that's the book.

40:52.247 --> 40:53.209
Can we hear the dealer?

40:53.469 --> 40:54.210
I don't know the dealer.

40:54.330 --> 40:54.991
I'd love to know.

40:55.231 --> 40:56.052
I don't know the dealer.

40:56.072 --> 40:56.873
I really don't know the dealer.

40:56.893 --> 40:57.373
I may find out.

40:57.453 --> 40:58.454
But can you imagine?

40:58.474 --> 40:59.235
I think you should.

40:59.255 --> 41:00.857
I mean, this is not a publication.

41:01.117 --> 41:01.598
I don't wish to.

41:01.618 --> 41:02.319
I don't wish to.

41:02.339 --> 41:02.919
I don't wish to.

41:03.300 --> 41:04.341
I don't know the dealer.

41:05.342 --> 41:05.662
I wasn't.

41:05.943 --> 41:07.324
But I mean, everything about it.

41:07.344 --> 41:10.548
So realistically, what's the book worth?

41:12.270 --> 41:12.390
Fifty.

41:17.298 --> 41:18.660
No.

41:18.680 --> 41:19.221
You did good.

41:19.581 --> 41:20.182
I did very good.

41:20.202 --> 41:20.723
You did good.

41:20.843 --> 41:21.884
I did wonderful.

41:21.944 --> 41:24.968
And I was offered another one, but it turned out to be the same book.

41:25.789 --> 41:29.575
Some other dealer knew of a copy of the Elliot's Bible, and I thought it was very interesting.

41:29.615 --> 41:43.273
To get back on track where I was heading, so accepting your assertion that this is arguably the finest, the best, the most important, not the finest.

41:43.293 --> 41:47.018
You've already distinguished between fine and good, and

41:47.875 --> 41:52.862
but the most important collection of American imprints, etc., in private hands.

41:54.505 --> 41:58.671
Understanding that, on the other hand, you say, well, I'll sell it.

41:58.691 --> 42:01.996
Stuff comes and goes, agent collected, dealer collected.

42:02.537 --> 42:03.758
What happens to the collection?

42:04.319 --> 42:12.972
I mean, if it's this important, if it's this significant, do you feel that it must remain as a collection, that it belongs someplace?

42:13.492 --> 42:19.479
Do you feel also that you go out into the world and feed the next generation of collectors?

42:19.499 --> 42:28.530
From my point, when you... Taking into account the suggestion that you are merely a custodian, holding things for the next generation.

42:28.550 --> 42:31.454
So there are a lot of things that I've heard today that are life-resolved.

42:31.654 --> 42:32.415
Let's put it that way.

42:33.436 --> 42:36.060
The tape is running good.

42:36.080 --> 42:36.740
It is good.

42:38.783 --> 42:41.106
This could be good.

42:41.126 --> 42:42.027
History is wonderful.

42:42.828 --> 42:42.908
Huh?

42:44.643 --> 42:48.967
I don't know, and don't presume to know, the mind of other collectors.

42:49.648 --> 43:03.582
Scheide and his father had his grandfather, or Carter Brown, or the Browns, not Carter Brown, but let's say the Brown family, put together great libraries.

43:03.602 --> 43:08.787
And I certainly don't come anywhere near beginning to talk about that.

43:09.607 --> 43:14.312
What happened to me was that if I have a talent, which is simply

43:15.052 --> 43:16.674
or let's say I have some talents.

43:17.374 --> 43:22.680
One of the talents is recognizing value, abstract value, as I was talking to you before.

43:22.740 --> 43:29.407
And in collecting where I was collecting in Bywaters, which are fun, I'm challenging my own intellect.

43:29.467 --> 43:31.830
If I'm in business, I'm a professional in my business.

43:32.430 --> 43:33.171
Here's a challenge.

43:33.211 --> 43:36.114
Can I be a professional as an amateur?

43:37.035 --> 43:38.317
Or a professional amateur?

43:38.557 --> 43:41.060
Or the true sense of the amateur that I can operate.

43:41.080 --> 43:42.401
You don't make a living from it.

43:42.421 --> 43:44.383
Whether you make a living from it or you don't,

43:44.566 --> 43:49.112
You compete with the sharks on equal terms.

43:49.392 --> 43:53.538
Oh, I believe the editor has advantages.

43:53.738 --> 44:00.387
Well, whether they have advantages or not, the question is, I guess, the basic question is, can I buy a book and sell it to a dealer to profit?

44:01.208 --> 44:10.320
Now, there is this very simple litmus test if you want to deal with your sense of value with your eye.

44:12.545 --> 44:39.818
Where I came and where I've come into this situation, or in this position that I'm in today, is that because of the number of circumstances, I was able to, out of many areas of collecting, many, many, many channels that I was collecting in, and I collected the area of the history of printing outside of America, which are the question, or outside of Europe, which I

44:40.051 --> 44:53.467
I'm doing the book on it, we'll publish in the future, which is not, when did the first book get printed in Napoli, but when did the first book get printed in Tananariva, or Matavidea, or Papua New Guinea, what have you.

44:53.527 --> 44:58.653
And I've been collecting missionary imprints and examples of early presses outside of Europe.

44:59.374 --> 45:06.242
And I collected natural history, and I collected, wait, let me just finish this one.

45:06.262 --> 45:07.543
I collected...

45:07.945 --> 45:25.804
and I am collecting, I have a collection of modern American fiction, I have a collection of Bibles, American Bibles, I have a collection, I have lots of areas, American bindings, which you saw, which is a very formidable collection, but those are collections from the basis of, I would say, almost accumulations.

45:25.925 --> 45:34.594
You see things, you buy them, you're a book jockey to the extent you see, you just accumulate, and all of a sudden, the accumulation has some

45:35.975 --> 45:38.598
It reaches a critical mass and becomes a collection.

45:38.939 --> 45:49.232
Now, because of a lot of diverse circumstances... Well, there are general focuses, or foci, or what have you, but they don't necessarily... You don't have to focus, just buy.

45:49.993 --> 45:56.741
And if you can buy within a budget... Don't tell me you're casting out a wide net, pulling in all this shit and pushing, and then calling the good stuff out.

45:56.861 --> 45:59.765
No, you buy everything... You're pulling a lot of crap in the net?

45:59.785 --> 46:00.286
All the time.

46:01.167 --> 46:03.049
If you can't buy crap, you can't differentiate.

46:03.590 --> 46:05.172
You've got to have the crap to see what good it is.

46:05.877 --> 46:07.039
Well, someone has to tell you.

46:07.119 --> 46:11.606
Roger Kennedy of the Smithsonian, Kennedy of the Smithsonian, says to me, we're talking about Texas.

46:12.427 --> 46:14.911
One of the assertions is, they brought so much shit.

46:15.552 --> 46:16.534
This is what people say.

46:17.375 --> 46:26.029
And he said, you know, he said, I believe that you cannot understand the masterpiece unless you look at all the junk that led up to it.

46:26.482 --> 46:30.588
I think, first of all... This is the guy that puts junk on the shelves in the museum, you know?

46:30.628 --> 46:32.811
But first of all, I happen to ascribe to that.

46:32.831 --> 46:33.431
Do you believe that?

46:33.692 --> 46:39.039
I think that it's not a universal statement, but I think that a lot of people can benefit from it.

46:39.059 --> 46:42.344
But that's the man that runs the Smithsonian who's saying this.

46:43.405 --> 46:54.480
But the whole idea of connoisseurship, for example, Berenson didn't buy, you know, 50,000 paintings of shit to be the expert in what he was, but in the little piss-ass world that I live in,

46:55.270 --> 47:03.262
I have found that if I buy everything indiscriminately, I develop a sense of differential value, differential appreciation.

47:03.282 --> 47:04.103
You learn from it.

47:04.123 --> 47:05.205
That's me.

47:05.225 --> 47:07.088
That's not necessarily you or anyone else.

47:07.969 --> 47:23.573
But it happened to work out that because of some events that happened, decisions I had to take, which one had to be with the flood, where I lost a lot of books, none of which were my

47:24.093 --> 47:28.597
Evans material, my early American imprint, so I decided that... Evans meaning what?

47:29.117 --> 47:41.909
Evans, Charles Evans was a bibliography, a bibliographer, who did the primary bibliography on early American imprint, the history of printing in America, the 1800s.

47:41.929 --> 47:45.332
And I realized... So you were going out of punchlines, so to speak.

47:45.972 --> 47:48.855
Yeah, in a very broad way, which is everything.

47:49.796 --> 47:52.598
And what happened was,

47:54.063 --> 48:07.819
I recognized that in my accumulating, in my relative interest, while accumulating in many areas, I had accumulated and brought together a lot of early American imprints.

48:08.800 --> 48:21.775
And the reason I was able to do it was that the area, the primary area I was interested in, which was printing in America before 1700,

48:22.649 --> 48:26.734
It could not be a lot of Americana, if you will, for whatever it was.

48:26.915 --> 48:27.836
Yeah.

48:27.856 --> 48:33.743
So I decided I wanted to buy early American infants.

48:33.763 --> 48:34.304
Could it be done?

48:34.344 --> 48:35.726
Everyone would say it couldn't be done.

48:35.766 --> 48:39.871
The reason it couldn't be done was that A, they're absolutely rare.

48:40.392 --> 48:42.014
B, they had evidence.

48:43.296 --> 48:51.306
They had disappeared from the marketplace so that the dealers could not accumulate enough books to put a catalog on them.

48:51.691 --> 48:53.273
If they got one or two, they'd sell them.

48:53.313 --> 48:54.755
They would go out or what have you.

48:55.596 --> 49:01.284
And it was still at a time when I started buying these things when perfectness was neat, was nice.

49:01.304 --> 49:03.847
And an imperfect book was less than garbage.

49:05.670 --> 49:07.993
So this is where you... This is where I started.

49:08.013 --> 49:10.656
...where you assume the reputation of a guy who will take anything.

49:10.697 --> 49:11.958
I heard you say this, though.

49:12.519 --> 49:12.879
It's true.

49:12.919 --> 49:17.065
We were at a cocktail party in New York, and you talked to a friend of mine.

49:17.145 --> 49:18.908
It was a dude in American Graphic Art.

49:19.488 --> 49:20.770
And you said, I don't give a shit about you.

49:21.188 --> 49:22.871
Of course, I give a shit about it.

49:22.891 --> 49:25.374
But the point is, I'm trying to get the goods.

49:25.434 --> 49:27.778
If I don't tell them, then I'll take it.

49:27.838 --> 49:28.799
They'll never show it to you.

49:28.819 --> 49:30.642
They'll never show it, because they won't think of it.

49:30.662 --> 49:31.684
You can't believe it.

49:31.784 --> 49:35.369
It's like asking Farrah Fawcett for a date, because you're afraid she's going to turn you down.

49:35.630 --> 49:40.557
She's still got two legs in a hole.

49:40.677 --> 49:43.121
I mean, come on.

49:43.161 --> 49:45.585
That's because he's got a woman.

49:45.645 --> 49:48.529
You're one of the people who's willing to take what everybody else was in.

49:48.569 --> 49:49.170
That's right.

49:49.420 --> 49:58.008
You just talked a moment ago about accumulating the vast quantity from which you treat critical mass, from which there grows a collection of work.

49:58.028 --> 49:58.209
Right.

49:58.989 --> 50:05.296
One of the ways you can do that in a crazy world is to take the crimps.

50:05.316 --> 50:07.518
You start with a thing that no one else is looking for.

50:08.258 --> 50:12.022
You do it at a low threshold of financial pain.

50:12.703 --> 50:14.905
You accumulate a vast quantity.

50:15.492 --> 50:17.355
And that somehow takes on a critical mass.

50:17.375 --> 50:18.456
It takes a life of its own.

50:18.556 --> 50:20.218
And you wake up one morning, you have a collection.

50:21.039 --> 50:24.304
You're then increasingly less and less by the shift.

50:24.324 --> 50:27.809
You concentrate on filling in the spaces with the really good stuff.

50:27.829 --> 50:37.502
But what I'm saying, though, is that whether Thomas did it, or Henry Stevens as a dealer did it, or Brindley did it, they all did it.

50:37.522 --> 50:40.065
But what happened was, in my case,

50:40.552 --> 50:45.459
When Henry Huntington came in and bought everything in the 20s, the 1910s and 1910s.

50:45.780 --> 50:48.123
The same members in the teens.

50:48.204 --> 50:48.825
That's right.

50:48.845 --> 50:50.267
He bought everything.

50:50.287 --> 50:52.170
He creamed the market at the time.

50:52.470 --> 51:01.023
And it took literally 60 years for the remnants to start filtering up to the surface.

51:01.043 --> 51:04.348
And over those 60 years, the remnants of what?

51:05.206 --> 51:12.997
the examples of books that escaped his net or the net of the institutions holding these early American imprints.

51:13.057 --> 51:17.803
I'm talking now as an arbitrary cutoff, books printed before 1701.

51:17.883 --> 51:33.525
Now, for whatever it was, the idea of going back to roots or having examples of the early press intrigued me, and I had certain talents to go out and discover them.

51:33.792 --> 51:34.393
Where'd you go?

51:34.753 --> 51:35.895
Tell me a little.

51:35.995 --> 51:36.656
Give me a little.

51:36.796 --> 51:37.537
I went to cellars.

51:37.557 --> 51:38.238
Give me some stories.

51:38.258 --> 51:39.019
I went to cellars.

51:39.059 --> 51:40.381
I went to the cellar of Quaritch.

51:40.581 --> 51:41.863
Give me some color, as they say.

51:42.183 --> 51:43.945
Okay.

51:44.406 --> 51:45.247
I went to Quaritch.

51:45.267 --> 51:46.429
I went to Francis Edwards.

51:46.449 --> 51:47.190
I went to Mags.

51:47.230 --> 51:48.191
I went into the cellars.

51:48.351 --> 51:49.653
You can't leave.

51:49.693 --> 51:50.714
You get dirty.

51:50.754 --> 51:52.376
You swat.

51:52.396 --> 51:53.458
All the time.

51:53.478 --> 51:54.319
All the time.

51:54.719 --> 51:55.380
All the time.

51:55.921 --> 51:56.682
Is it exhilarating?

51:57.583 --> 51:59.125
It's not a question of exhilarating.

51:59.145 --> 52:01.548
Do you know what you're looking for or do you know what it is?

52:01.649 --> 52:01.849
No.

52:01.949 --> 52:02.770
I know what it is when I see it.

52:03.374 --> 52:04.475
And I have a good audience.

52:04.495 --> 52:20.114
Lennon Baskin, which is, you really, you may be the second one, but he showed me some things, and I won't go on, it'll take some time to explain, but he's the artist, and he had some art things, and he made a connection, and it was wonderful.

52:21.256 --> 52:31.508
And I said, but, and so far as I know, it's an unrecorded book, and it's this and that, explaining significance, but the point is, he had no,

52:32.399 --> 52:35.665
idea what it was until the moment he saw it.

52:35.905 --> 52:41.916
But the perception, the insight and the connections were there to say, this is an extraordinary discovery.

52:42.136 --> 52:43.859
Next, it's like smelling pussy.

52:44.340 --> 52:57.563
When you see a woman walk down the street, when you see a woman walking down the street and it's going up and this and this and this and this, you know, you simply know, that's it.

52:58.167 --> 53:00.650
and it's those pharognomes or whatever you want to call it.

53:00.670 --> 53:02.052
Am I describing a sentence?

53:02.112 --> 53:02.853
Absolutely.

53:02.913 --> 53:04.515
Does he have it there when he says that?

53:04.535 --> 53:04.796
Yep.

53:05.236 --> 53:06.498
He showed me this thing.

53:06.598 --> 53:08.300
You know.

53:11.304 --> 53:23.820
Whether you have, everyone has an eye, whether you have an internal eye or what have you, all I'm saying is that when I recognize, and to some degree it was a challenge, but it really was,

53:28.222 --> 53:34.128
something you do without qualification or self-questioning.

53:34.568 --> 53:40.374
If I want to go out, I decided I wanted to buy 17th century American infants.

53:41.295 --> 53:49.323
I wanted to accumulate 17th century, but I had no preconceived... What made you decide in one of these 1700 infants?

53:54.248 --> 53:55.950
I think because...

53:57.500 --> 54:00.383
Do you buy them and absorb them and read them and learn from them?

54:00.403 --> 54:09.332
Are you a scholar in the sense that... I once, I guess, to some degree, I'm not a scholar, but I'm certainly a knowledgeable person in the sense that... Maybe so, when you're writing a book, which sounded very interesting.

54:09.892 --> 54:12.955
Repeat the quote of fortune-mindedness.

54:12.975 --> 54:13.256
Oh, Jesus.

54:13.496 --> 54:14.076
Another time?

54:14.317 --> 54:14.677
No.

54:15.478 --> 54:19.642
I... May I?

54:19.862 --> 54:20.203
Yeah.

54:20.343 --> 54:21.264
This might kill it.

54:21.284 --> 54:25.067
Give me a little first.

54:25.087 --> 54:25.768
I...

54:26.221 --> 54:30.647
I don't want to buy them.

54:30.708 --> 54:38.779
So there was an article about book collectors that was in Forbes magazine some years ago.

54:39.100 --> 54:40.902
And I was interviewed.

54:40.922 --> 54:41.123
Really?

54:41.643 --> 54:44.528
How did they find out about you?

54:44.548 --> 54:48.734
And Stanley Marcus and some other guy.

54:49.094 --> 54:50.016
He does the miniatures.

54:50.056 --> 54:51.478
Yeah.

54:51.498 --> 54:53.741
Little pussy things, right?

54:54.001 --> 54:55.063
How do you stop it?

54:55.313 --> 54:58.594
This thing here?

54:58.614 --> 55:00.345
We're going over on the other side right now.
