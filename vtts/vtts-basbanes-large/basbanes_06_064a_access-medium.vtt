WEBVTT

00:02.410 --> 00:07.017
So we're on with Mr. Carter Burden in New York, and I'm going to just put this close to you.

00:08.018 --> 00:10.201
I guess I have read a lot of the background.

00:10.982 --> 00:15.068
Those pieces that I mentioned, are the facts in there essentially correct?

00:15.088 --> 00:19.034
I think essentially correct, yeah, as I recall.

00:19.335 --> 00:20.576
I mean, Harvard is correct.

00:20.636 --> 00:21.518
Yes, yes, yes.

00:21.538 --> 00:23.220
I mean, the basic biographical things.

00:23.240 --> 00:25.704
I really don't want to ask you biographical questions.

00:25.724 --> 00:29.329
Yeah, no, the biographical stuff I think is absolutely correct.

00:29.748 --> 00:30.489
Let's start.

00:30.709 --> 00:32.392
Has the passion diminished in any way?

00:32.853 --> 00:37.840
No, I've been on a bit of a hiatus because we sold our apartment.

00:38.461 --> 00:39.783
You don't mind if I do this?

00:39.803 --> 00:41.165
No, please, I just did it myself.

00:43.949 --> 00:51.901
For 23 years, I'd been in this large apartment on the East River that was great for quantity of books.

00:51.921 --> 00:53.003
I mean, they had a lot of room.

00:54.025 --> 00:57.430
And for various reasons, my kids had both grown up.

00:57.470 --> 00:59.012
My wife...

00:59.296 --> 01:07.968
have been eager to move for quite some time, and I was afraid the floor was probably going to collapse into the next apartment.

01:08.048 --> 01:16.038
We sold that a year ago, and everything has been, all my books have been in storage for the last year.

01:16.619 --> 01:17.140
As we speak?

01:17.180 --> 01:18.221
As we speak, really.

01:19.844 --> 01:26.873
We have bought a new apartment, which is much smaller, and I will be able to have fewer books, but it's going to be basically

01:27.528 --> 01:36.117
The best feature is a double-height living room, but it's going to be all bookcases, which I think will ultimately be a fabulous room.

01:36.638 --> 01:41.023
But I will have one less room, which is a problem, so I think I have to be more selective.

01:41.624 --> 01:47.991
And two, not having the books around is distressing.

01:48.131 --> 01:48.571
Really?

01:48.671 --> 01:50.313
Yeah, it's really true.

01:50.333 --> 01:54.137
It becomes more abstract to collect.

01:54.197 --> 01:56.640
What in particular do you miss?

01:57.413 --> 01:59.436
Well, I like books as objects, too.

01:59.476 --> 02:05.103
I mean, I think they're, I like living with them, I like looking at them, I like holding them, and so forth.

02:05.323 --> 02:09.909
And if you are just collecting from a list, it's just, it's not the same thing.

02:09.929 --> 02:16.258
I love, I make all my own, you know, glassine covers and so forth.

02:16.378 --> 02:16.558
Yeah.

02:17.459 --> 02:27.032
And, which I, was manual therapy for me, and I loved then putting a book in the right place, you know, with the author collection and so forth.

02:27.367 --> 02:29.269
So you'll be cutting the collection down now.

02:29.349 --> 02:31.612
At last count, it was around 70,000 volumes.

02:31.992 --> 02:36.036
Yeah, that number, I'm not sure how accurate that is.

02:36.096 --> 02:40.161
That was just a very rough calculation.

02:40.201 --> 02:41.783
This is... It's impossible.

02:41.943 --> 02:42.523
It's impossible.

02:42.563 --> 02:46.147
I mean, I say I've got anywhere between 5,000 and 7,000 volumes.

02:46.167 --> 02:47.028
It's a lot of books.

02:47.829 --> 02:50.732
But whether it's 5,000 or 7,000, I couldn't tell you.

02:50.752 --> 02:51.493
Yeah, exactly.

02:52.794 --> 02:55.197
I...

02:57.877 --> 02:59.720
I'm on the board of the New York Public Library.

02:59.760 --> 03:06.008
I just went on the Morgan Library Board, and I'm on the Library Visiting Committee at Harvard.

03:06.809 --> 03:13.699
And I think all three of those places are places I'd like to give, you know, completed collections to.

03:13.799 --> 03:17.684
I did give my science fiction collection to the New York Public Library.

03:17.864 --> 03:20.728
Somebody mentioned that to me as a really excellent collection.

03:20.748 --> 03:22.030
It's a wonderful collection, yeah.

03:22.210 --> 03:24.153
You know, it's a fairly esoteric field.

03:24.393 --> 03:26.837
Somebody in California mentioned that.

03:26.857 --> 03:27.057
Yeah.

03:27.239 --> 03:28.340
It might have been Ralph Sipper.

03:28.441 --> 03:29.422
Yeah, yeah.

03:29.442 --> 03:31.705
Because I saw Ralph up in Santa Fe.

03:31.725 --> 03:35.730
And he said your science fiction collection was a major collection.

03:36.491 --> 03:42.158
In fact, I think you were one of the very first people to maybe take it very seriously.

03:42.198 --> 03:42.879
Well, I don't know.

03:43.099 --> 03:44.501
I don't think I can take back credit.

03:44.561 --> 03:50.128
I mean, I think... But I guess when you think about the... It's always been very actively collected.

03:50.148 --> 03:53.993
I mean, you know, the prices were very high for some of those people.

03:54.013 --> 03:54.293
But...

03:54.897 --> 03:58.323
I think maybe the context was this is something the New York public really didn't have.

03:58.343 --> 03:59.224
The New York didn't have at all.

03:59.565 --> 04:04.413
Which I guess you have to take into account, collecting modern firsts.

04:05.074 --> 04:09.582
I have realized that I can't do all, I mean, I can't keep up with

04:09.815 --> 04:10.937
you know, with everything.

04:10.997 --> 04:11.618
I mean, it's absurd.

04:11.638 --> 04:12.620
But you tried, though.

04:12.640 --> 04:13.120
I tried.

04:13.321 --> 04:15.685
I made a manful effort at it.

04:16.766 --> 04:17.848
Were you defeated, do you think?

04:17.908 --> 04:18.689
I think I was defeated.

04:19.070 --> 04:20.833
Yeah, I think I was defeated.

04:21.113 --> 04:23.718
Because another question is, is the collection ever complete?

04:23.878 --> 04:25.460
No, it never is complete.

04:25.480 --> 04:28.485
No book collector ever closes a collection, I think.

04:28.505 --> 04:29.086
Yeah, I don't think so.

04:29.166 --> 04:35.597
And your house and garden piece, you say, you give the uptick case, you know, he was for, he's a possible, I start collecting.

04:35.617 --> 04:36.919
You have to, I mean, exactly.

04:37.102 --> 04:39.525
I'm still trying with him.

04:39.585 --> 04:41.727
I know, exactly.

04:41.767 --> 04:46.373
And if he tried to do every issue, one of 26 and one of 200.

04:46.413 --> 04:52.400
He does this very mindfully.

04:53.421 --> 04:55.363
He has a sense of the market.

04:55.383 --> 04:56.124
He really does.

04:56.565 --> 04:57.786
Do you think he makes much money from it?

04:58.627 --> 05:00.389
I think he makes enough money from it.

05:01.210 --> 05:05.455
I think he's a good young man from Pennsylvania.

05:05.873 --> 05:12.503
This is just my own sense, because I know one guy that prints things in Worcester, Bill Ferguson does medical books.

05:12.523 --> 05:13.845
I mean, they sit down and they talk.

05:14.085 --> 05:15.047
They really do, yeah.

05:15.107 --> 05:20.355
They talk about what the breakdown is going to be.

05:20.375 --> 05:21.917
He's never divulged any of these figures.

05:22.318 --> 05:24.821
I've always been curious what the author actually made out of some of these things.

05:24.861 --> 05:25.342
I don't know.

05:25.983 --> 05:27.005
But he drives a bargain.

05:27.285 --> 05:28.106
Yeah, he does.

05:28.587 --> 05:31.251
It's not for love at all.

05:33.795 --> 05:34.716
You have, I guess...

05:35.135 --> 05:36.417
6,000 authors.

05:36.858 --> 05:38.039
Yeah.

05:38.059 --> 05:44.269
Is it possible when you have 6,000 authors, my God, to know your authors, to know your collection?

05:44.289 --> 05:45.551
No, it became impossible.

05:45.691 --> 05:49.617
I mean, it became... We are.

05:50.959 --> 05:57.328
I think it's, as you well know, I think, I mean, it's a something, I mean, it's a feel that you live and learn.

05:57.368 --> 06:01.935
I mean, experience is very important, and I know a hell of a lot more than I did

06:02.388 --> 06:12.704
ten years ago, and I never would, if I were starting today, I certainly would never attempt to be as broad as I started out to be.

06:13.585 --> 06:27.687
And now it really is a process of winnowing it down, reducing the number of authors considerably, probably trying to be less complete

06:27.970 --> 06:33.957
in terms of having every issue of a book and all that kind of stuff, and proofs and all the rest of it.

06:34.638 --> 06:42.548
Well, when you winnow down, do you discard the lesser authors, the ones with the lesser reputation, or the ones you don't like?

06:43.309 --> 06:47.554
I've been debating this in my own mind the last year.

06:47.755 --> 06:56.205
I thought one approach was to take a whole category and like the science fiction and give it to the New York Public Library.

06:56.388 --> 06:59.213
But that was something they didn't have at all.

06:59.273 --> 07:04.501
They were interested in, and I wanted to do something for them.

07:05.423 --> 07:16.741
I could do that, say, with all detective fiction or all poetry or whatever like that, but that I just don't want to do, I don't think.

07:16.781 --> 07:21.889
So what I'm trying to do is keep the people I consider more important.

07:22.628 --> 07:24.951
I guess the collection is about, what, 10 years?

07:24.991 --> 07:26.894
Can you give me a year about when it started?

07:27.915 --> 07:28.876
I can't remember the exact year.

07:28.896 --> 07:32.021
I think it was probably 79, 80, something like that.

07:32.041 --> 07:34.063
And you collect everything, by the way, apparently.

07:34.284 --> 07:36.487
I mean, you collect toy soldiers and baseball.

07:36.567 --> 07:38.129
Oh, yeah, but not at the same time.

07:38.169 --> 07:39.511
That's what you started with.

07:39.531 --> 07:39.631
Yeah.

07:39.871 --> 07:46.781
But, I mean, you're a respected collector of art and sculpture and everything.

07:46.821 --> 07:47.742
Right, right.

07:48.059 --> 07:52.062
But from what I can gather, the passion is really now for the books.

07:52.082 --> 07:52.643
Very much so.

07:52.823 --> 07:53.584
Yeah, very much.

07:53.604 --> 07:56.906
And why would you say you came to this last?

07:56.926 --> 07:57.507
I don't know.

07:57.567 --> 07:59.148
Where were you all these years?

07:59.168 --> 08:00.069
It's interesting.

08:00.189 --> 08:01.090
I really don't know.

08:01.110 --> 08:02.191
I really don't know.

08:02.271 --> 08:11.199
I think that, well, in one sense, I mean, art became just too expensive to collect.

08:11.239 --> 08:17.644
I mean, I started collecting American contemporary art in the 60s.

08:18.265 --> 08:24.433
when you could buy a Frank Stella for $2,000 and a Jasper Johns for $10,000.

08:24.473 --> 08:30.301
That, fairly quickly, got out of my league entirely.

08:30.401 --> 08:33.966
Did you buy some of these things for directing?

08:33.986 --> 08:34.967
Oh, yes, absolutely.

08:34.987 --> 08:36.910
I bought a Jasper Johns for $10,000.

08:36.970 --> 08:46.062
I had, at one point, 15 Stellas, Rothko, de Kooning,

08:46.582 --> 08:47.343
Barnett Newman.

08:47.584 --> 08:54.436
Well, with the market being what it has been, not necessarily what it is at this moment, has the temptation been to sell?

08:54.496 --> 08:55.819
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

08:55.839 --> 08:57.522
I mean, you had a couple of zeros.

08:57.542 --> 09:02.250
I paid for my book collecting, basically, with the profits I made on the thing.

09:02.270 --> 09:02.471
Really?

09:03.092 --> 09:03.312
Yeah, yeah.

09:03.332 --> 09:05.095
Did you ever consider these investments?

09:05.496 --> 09:06.598
Never, never.

09:07.810 --> 09:10.192
Sometimes you have to tell your family you missed them.

09:10.212 --> 09:11.273
You did, exactly.

09:11.854 --> 09:12.014
Exactly.

09:12.034 --> 09:17.199
Well, now they think, of course, they thought I was nuts at the time, and now they think I'm a genius for having done it.

09:17.920 --> 09:21.163
And the whole point is I wasn't nuts and I wasn't a genius.

09:22.164 --> 09:24.886
Roger started at Harvard, you must know Roger.

09:24.906 --> 09:27.989
A wonderful man, I think.

09:28.009 --> 09:29.711
We've been together a number of times.

09:30.151 --> 09:37.378
He said, well, one thing that puzzles me as much as anything, without naming anyone, because he's a very discreet man,

09:37.628 --> 09:41.293
why some people, not why they start collecting, but why they stop.

09:42.174 --> 09:44.297
And I'm sure he had in mind Arthur Houghton.

09:44.598 --> 09:46.280
Right, except he had the perfect example.

09:46.440 --> 09:47.702
He had the perfect example.

09:48.283 --> 09:52.649
And I've asked a number of people, and nobody really has.

09:52.809 --> 09:54.852
In fact, he died, and I never had a chance to think of him.

09:56.254 --> 09:58.978
And some people say, well, maybe people thought he was crazy.

09:59.127 --> 10:01.169
and he wanted to prove that he wasn't.

10:01.470 --> 10:03.372
But I think that's too simple.

10:04.393 --> 10:11.700
Have you run into a fellow called Michael Thomas, who's a writer who's written several novels, and was a good collector.

10:11.720 --> 10:18.568
I mean, you know, fairly small scale, but had a fabulous Wah collection and a great Eliot collection and other things like that.

10:18.588 --> 10:25.335
And he just, in the last couple years, just decided to sell everything.

10:25.535 --> 10:27.177
Sold the whole collection through

10:27.663 --> 10:32.290
Glenn Horowitz, and he would be interesting to talk to in terms of why he's done.

10:32.310 --> 10:33.232
Is he in New York?

10:33.332 --> 10:35.014
He lives out on Long Island.

10:35.094 --> 10:35.936
He's from New York.

10:38.119 --> 10:39.822
What does he do?

10:39.882 --> 10:43.908
He's a columnist for the paper called The New York Observer.

10:43.928 --> 10:45.510
I think I have heard of him.

10:45.530 --> 10:47.153
And he's written about four or five novels.

10:47.533 --> 10:48.855
So I have heard of him.

10:49.236 --> 10:49.957
Yeah.

10:49.977 --> 10:53.983
And I can either get you his number or... But he's very articulate.

10:54.003 --> 10:54.644
I mean, he's a writer.

10:54.664 --> 10:56.387
He's very articulate and a collector.

10:56.924 --> 10:58.966
And he would be interesting to talk to on that point.

10:58.986 --> 11:00.928
That would be very interesting.

11:00.949 --> 11:03.451
I'm doing a lot of these little things, not just collectors.

11:03.491 --> 11:12.101
For instance, Yale primarily, for instance, has an undergraduate award for book collectors.

11:12.121 --> 11:12.962
Why do they do that?

11:13.503 --> 11:14.984
Just to interest people in books.

11:15.084 --> 11:15.645
I was at J.C.

11:16.126 --> 11:16.486
Dallin.

11:16.526 --> 11:18.548
That was Harvard, by the way.

11:18.568 --> 11:20.130
Does Harvard give an award?

11:20.313 --> 11:22.435
I asked Tom Adams about this last week.

11:22.455 --> 11:24.057
He said, well, Harvard, you can get it better.

11:24.077 --> 11:25.178
They used to give a seminar.

11:25.198 --> 11:26.919
Well, there was that famous guy who, yeah.

11:27.040 --> 11:27.940
Famous guy, Winship.

11:28.501 --> 11:30.403
Yeah, I guess so.

11:30.863 --> 11:33.166
And, you know, Arthur Houghton was one of his students.

11:33.346 --> 11:33.466
Right.

11:33.646 --> 11:34.767
Oh, a lot of it could be exciting.

11:34.807 --> 11:39.892
And he said, you know, they infected him with this enthusiasm for books.

11:39.952 --> 11:42.495
And, you know, he said, be a little cynical.

11:42.515 --> 11:43.676
He said, look ahead.

11:44.357 --> 11:47.940
And Harvard does give an award, huh?

11:48.460 --> 11:52.145
To the undergraduate collection, the most interesting undergraduate collection.

11:52.165 --> 12:06.983
It would be interesting to find out, because I have been talking to the accomplished collectors, or the interesting collectors, but not the beginning, which might make a very interesting study.

12:07.003 --> 12:08.044
I think it would be very interesting.

12:08.685 --> 12:15.413
I do think the instinct is innate to some extent, but I think it could clearly be nurtured.

12:15.848 --> 12:24.898
And I mean, what a better thing to do than to encourage people to something that's going to enrich their lives and their minds for, you know, the next 40 years.

12:24.978 --> 12:25.879
I think it's a great idea.

12:26.159 --> 12:29.362
Innate on the one hand, but not inherited on the other.

12:29.622 --> 12:31.124
No, definitely not inherited.

12:31.184 --> 12:31.985
Definitely not inherited.

12:32.586 --> 12:37.911
Because the first thing so many people do, I mean, look at Bradley Martin's collection, you know, Scattered to the Fort Wayne.

12:38.832 --> 12:39.473
Right, right.

12:39.493 --> 12:44.438
And this is something I want to talk about at some point, but...

12:45.076 --> 12:53.107
On the one hand, so much of his stuff really should have gone out into the market, because you have to think of the next generation of collectors.

12:53.127 --> 12:55.690
I mean, there are first folios in institutions.

12:55.730 --> 12:57.332
Why should you have given that to an institution?

12:57.693 --> 13:03.421
But the ornithological collection was pretty extraordinary, better than any institutional collection.

13:03.481 --> 13:07.506
And there was an argument that maybe that should have been kept together.

13:07.874 --> 13:10.398
Do you have any philosophical thoughts on this?

13:10.418 --> 13:12.180
Well, I think it becomes a very practical question.

13:12.200 --> 13:14.323
I mean, what was the total for those sales?

13:14.383 --> 13:15.925
Twenty-something million dollars?

13:15.945 --> 13:16.286
Big money.

13:16.366 --> 13:16.947
Twenty-nine.

13:17.067 --> 13:18.309
Twenty-nine million dollars.

13:18.749 --> 13:31.787
Well, in order for his heirs to have kept the collection, for example, they would have had to come up with seventeen million dollars in cash just to keep the books, which becomes prohibitive.

13:32.268 --> 13:33.269
Why would they have to?

13:33.290 --> 13:34.371
Because of inheritance taxes.

13:34.520 --> 13:37.223
I mean, but couldn't he have taken care of this beforehand?

13:37.303 --> 13:42.970
No, he would have, one way or the other, he would have had to pay that much, either gift tax or inheritance tax.

13:42.990 --> 13:49.377
It's like, that's why nobody inherits these hugely valuable paintings anymore, unless you've got billions of dollars and lots of cash.

13:49.898 --> 13:52.621
It becomes a very expensive thing to pass on.

13:52.661 --> 13:54.483
It also becomes an enormous asset.

13:54.523 --> 13:58.368
I don't know how, and Bradley Martin was rich, but I mean, $30 million is $30 million.

13:58.788 --> 14:02.012
There is irony, though, isn't there?

14:02.954 --> 14:23.680
$30 million if this Japanese guy who spent $150 million for two paintings had, if his artistic taste were inclined to books, what he could have done, I mean, with the Doheny sale, $30 million, Martin, $29 million, Garden, $16 million,

14:24.706 --> 14:27.350
He could have built one of the finest libraries in the world.

14:27.410 --> 14:32.357
He had 20 or 30 million left over to build a shrine, you know, to house it all.

14:32.377 --> 14:35.461
And all he would have had to have done was hold his hand out.

14:35.942 --> 14:37.864
So we have to keep this thing in context.

14:38.185 --> 14:49.601
The night before the garden sale, the night before, De Kooning, who was a living artist, 21 million to a Japanese, 16 million for 314 lots of the garden.

14:49.621 --> 14:50.342
So we do have to...

14:50.660 --> 14:54.004
We do have to kind of keep... Look, a Ferrari went for $10 million.

14:54.044 --> 14:57.929
I mean, it's really... It's all... There's no such thing as absolute value, anyway.

14:58.009 --> 15:02.835
But books remain an excellent thing to collect.

15:03.015 --> 15:04.217
And you can collect at any level.

15:04.577 --> 15:05.258
Right.

15:05.278 --> 15:05.398
Right.

15:05.419 --> 15:05.759
Exactly.

15:05.779 --> 15:10.305
You can go out and do lovely things for dollars.

15:10.585 --> 15:11.546
Right.

15:11.566 --> 15:11.827
Exactly.

15:11.847 --> 15:12.207
I agree with you.

15:12.287 --> 15:17.394
If you're inclined to go to the Brimfield Fair, which is running now in Massachusetts, you know, you don't mind getting dirty.

15:17.434 --> 15:17.794
I vote.

15:17.894 --> 15:20.177
I love getting... Yeah, I like that, too.

15:20.832 --> 15:22.834
I'm sorry, how do I get off on this?

15:22.854 --> 15:30.301
But I guess we're talking about your own thoughts about... Why people stop, or the Bradley Martin, whether he should have given at the institution.

15:30.322 --> 15:33.805
I think it becomes financially prohibitive to do that, basically.

15:34.125 --> 15:48.780
It's certainly financially prohibitive to be able to inherit something of that value, although he could have kept some books and so forth.

15:48.980 --> 15:55.427
But I think it's great to help institutions, and I think it's great to put them up for other collectors to buy.

15:55.467 --> 15:58.410
I don't think there's an absolute rule that should apply.

15:58.630 --> 16:01.312
Were you naive early?

16:01.352 --> 16:02.814
Would you say you were kind of a naive collector?

16:02.874 --> 16:03.074
Oh, yeah.

16:03.214 --> 16:03.715
Absolutely.

16:03.975 --> 16:11.563
I mean, just the thought that you could collect the entire scope of a... Right, right.

16:11.583 --> 16:13.465
Well, I had no idea what I was getting into.

16:13.485 --> 16:18.750
I mean, I spent thousands of times more dollars than I ever, you know,

16:19.085 --> 16:19.866
planned to spend.

16:20.166 --> 16:20.707
Really?

16:20.727 --> 16:21.888
Yeah.

16:21.908 --> 16:24.191
So you made, do you think you made mistakes, or...?

16:25.192 --> 16:27.814
Well, I mean, you always make, everybody makes mistakes.

16:29.016 --> 16:31.038
Probably a lot of my mistakes I'm not even aware of.

16:33.501 --> 16:36.804
It is said that you influenced the price of books.

16:36.824 --> 16:37.925
Do you think that that's...?

16:37.945 --> 16:38.126
Probably.

16:38.146 --> 16:40.508
It's such a narrow field, I think it's possible.

16:42.310 --> 16:46.234
I mean, everybody knew that Carter Burden was buying books.

16:46.254 --> 16:48.096
Modern First, right, yeah.

16:48.597 --> 16:48.737
And

16:49.004 --> 16:57.232
I imagine that you must have heard from a lot of dealers urgently telling you about things that they have.

16:57.252 --> 16:59.074
Right, right.

16:59.094 --> 17:03.298
But I also understand that you negotiate.

17:03.519 --> 17:04.720
Oh, yeah, yeah.

17:04.780 --> 17:05.821
I mean, you're not a pushover.

17:05.981 --> 17:06.702
No, no.

17:07.643 --> 17:08.864
No, hopefully not.

17:08.884 --> 17:10.706
But what I mean is something might be irresistible.

17:10.726 --> 17:11.707
I have to have it.

17:11.907 --> 17:12.167
Yeah.

17:12.307 --> 17:14.530
Well, that's part of the sickness, right?

17:14.570 --> 17:16.071
But I don't have to have it at your price.

17:16.111 --> 17:18.994
Right, exactly, exactly.

17:19.362 --> 17:27.152
Well, one thing that works in my favor is that if it's that expensive, there's not a lot of competition for it.

17:27.172 --> 17:35.464
I mean, there's really not... There aren't people who are spending huge amounts of money for modern... Well, it's not... Certain authors, it's not true.

17:35.704 --> 17:43.394
I mean, I've lost... I mean, I've been outbid many times at auctioning things on James material and Pound material and so forth.

17:43.414 --> 17:45.237
Did you ever go to the auctions yourself?

17:45.557 --> 17:49.302
Yeah, but as a rule, I learned a long time ago that that's a mistake.

17:49.754 --> 17:52.518
That's what the chef told me last week.

17:53.139 --> 17:54.381
He said, never again.

17:54.421 --> 17:58.747
He gave me a very cute story, which I don't bore you with, but that was the last time.

18:00.770 --> 18:03.294
They saw me there, and things happened.

18:03.854 --> 18:09.843
Or if Carter Burden wants this so badly, maybe he'll buy it.

18:10.284 --> 18:11.686
Later, down the road.

18:12.908 --> 18:14.390
You have to get agents at some point.

18:14.590 --> 18:16.192
I think it's the only way to do it.

18:16.212 --> 18:17.314
It's really the only way to do it.

18:17.446 --> 18:19.990
And you buy from a whole network of dealers, I guess.

18:20.190 --> 18:28.121
Yeah, and I think you also, when you're there, you can get carried away and go way beyond what you should pay for something.

18:28.241 --> 18:31.285
Dick Manning, you know Dick, is a recent collector.

18:31.365 --> 18:32.547
He collects a lot of different things.

18:33.949 --> 18:36.953
I think he's still trying to find his focus.

18:36.973 --> 18:39.457
It's all over the place.

18:40.638 --> 18:45.445
But he said he became a collector because he used to bet heavily at the...

18:46.235 --> 18:47.096
at the Casino.

18:47.176 --> 18:47.577
Oh, really?

18:47.617 --> 18:48.738
No kidding.

18:48.999 --> 18:49.800
That was very great.

18:49.820 --> 18:51.221
I've never heard that connection before.

18:51.241 --> 18:51.762
That's interesting.

18:51.782 --> 18:52.603
But it makes sense.

18:52.623 --> 19:01.014
And he said, I get my kicks at the auctions, even if he's, well, when he bought the Shakespeare's, he was sitting right next to Jim Cummins, so everybody knew who was buying Shakespeare.

19:01.034 --> 19:02.276
Right, right.

19:02.296 --> 19:03.818
I mean, there was no mystery about that.

19:03.838 --> 19:05.119
Yeah, no mystery about it.

19:05.660 --> 19:06.581
Yeah.

19:06.601 --> 19:11.027
But, you know, it is a kick, I guess.

19:11.564 --> 19:13.306
You had been selling off parts of yours.

19:13.426 --> 19:15.569
I mean, in fact, I brought the Auden.

19:15.589 --> 19:18.512
I asked you to sign it.

19:20.475 --> 19:29.505
Well, this is part of the process of trying to winnow down and through a combination of selling and giving collections away.

19:29.966 --> 19:33.370
And I decided to do the Auden because

19:34.902 --> 19:39.308
I decided, well, he was marginal, not in terms of importance, but he really was English.

19:39.348 --> 19:40.489
He became an American citizen.

19:40.550 --> 19:44.855
So, I mean, you could have a collection of American literature without Auden.

19:46.237 --> 19:49.962
That's the reason I picked that, and I had a fair amount invested in that.

19:50.002 --> 19:52.706
It's a nice catalog, right?

19:52.726 --> 19:56.030
Yeah, yeah, very nice.

19:56.050 --> 20:00.336
He's, I think, as far as a modern person, just myself, he's wonderful.

20:01.025 --> 20:02.026
Prices are high.

20:02.126 --> 20:03.568
Prices are really high.

20:03.808 --> 20:07.311
I've just been negotiating with him on one of the books in his new catalog.

20:08.072 --> 20:09.593
The 20th anniversary one?

20:09.614 --> 20:09.734
Yeah.

20:09.754 --> 20:10.474
I haven't had a chance.

20:10.514 --> 20:11.135
I just got it.

20:11.175 --> 20:13.177
There's some great stuff in there.

20:13.197 --> 20:13.658
It looks good.

20:13.738 --> 20:15.219
We were just out there a couple weeks ago.

20:15.840 --> 20:18.122
I did an interview with John Larroquette, the actor.

20:18.542 --> 20:19.663
Oh, really?

20:20.044 --> 20:29.293
Who was a wonderful example of your basic novice collector.

20:29.797 --> 20:34.223
I mean, how do you get the novice collector into a book and make it interesting?

20:34.243 --> 20:36.105
And he just kind of fell out of the sky to me.

20:36.125 --> 20:37.507
He's a movie star.

20:37.687 --> 20:43.235
A star with four Emmys and who's a recovering alcoholic on top of that.

20:43.255 --> 20:44.256
Well, that's important.

20:44.276 --> 20:48.141
That's part of the... I asked him why... I said, I understand your collection.

20:49.383 --> 20:50.364
He showed me what he had.

20:50.384 --> 20:53.067
I said, but I don't understand why you're collecting Charles Bukowski.

20:53.928 --> 20:54.629
I said, I understand.

20:54.649 --> 20:56.832
I don't... And then it came.

20:56.852 --> 20:59.736
He said, because I saw in him what I was becoming.

20:59.952 --> 21:00.613
Oh, really?

21:00.653 --> 21:01.294
That's very good.

21:01.314 --> 21:02.015
What a quote.

21:02.115 --> 21:07.963
I mean, he said, I saw what was happening to my life and where I was going.

21:09.525 --> 21:11.688
Oh, that's a wonderful quote.

21:11.708 --> 21:12.889
Oh, my God, yeah.

21:12.909 --> 21:15.833
That's very good stuff.

21:15.853 --> 21:18.196
And then I interviewed a guy up in Sacramento.

21:18.317 --> 21:20.199
I started an item on him in the New York Times.

21:20.319 --> 21:22.142
He bought this Hemingway collection.

21:22.162 --> 21:23.764
Again, his collection is good.

21:24.445 --> 21:27.529
Certainly nothing to make a big deal about in a book.

21:28.792 --> 21:29.753
My wife came with me.

21:29.793 --> 21:32.136
I said, all right, we spent a half a day going to see this guy.

21:32.836 --> 21:36.680
I said, why is he getting, tell me why he's getting into the book.

21:37.601 --> 21:39.543
And she said, well, you asked him a question.

21:39.724 --> 21:40.444
I was just a guess.

21:40.524 --> 21:43.007
I said, did you mortgage your house to buy this collection?

21:43.047 --> 21:44.028
And he said, yes.

21:44.148 --> 21:47.011
And he said, my wife is divorcing me on top of it.

21:47.472 --> 21:47.792
Right, exactly.

21:47.812 --> 21:48.373
I like that.

21:48.593 --> 21:49.814
That's part of that.

21:50.395 --> 21:51.696
Yeah, absolutely.

21:51.776 --> 21:52.577
Absolutely.

21:52.597 --> 21:56.301
This is what happens, isn't it?

21:56.905 --> 21:58.427
Do we lose our senses?

21:58.487 --> 21:59.428
Do we lose our grip?

21:59.528 --> 22:03.653
Well, I tell you, I mean, you should probably talk to the families of collectors as well as the collectors.

22:03.734 --> 22:09.320
I mean, I think that my son could give you an earful, and my wife to some extent.

22:09.340 --> 22:26.642
My wife is basically very understanding, but, I mean, there were times, especially with the kids, where I would be so absorbed in catalogs and, you know, my list and putting books away and all the rest of it that it was, you know, that my list was more important than they were.

22:27.230 --> 22:32.901
And I started building bookcases in my son's room, which became a huge fight.

22:32.921 --> 22:33.582
Yeah, yeah.

22:34.283 --> 22:34.904
I have two daughters.

22:34.924 --> 22:37.749
And he was indignant, and my wife was indignant about that.

22:37.790 --> 22:39.573
And I said, but they're nice books.

22:40.975 --> 22:44.562
I noticed in one of those pieces where you tried to encourage your wife to collect.

22:44.863 --> 22:48.349
I started out, that's how I, that was my rationale.

22:48.590 --> 22:49.591
You see, that doesn't work.

22:49.732 --> 22:50.453
No, of course not.

22:50.720 --> 22:52.242
That's where the innate thing comes in.

22:52.262 --> 22:53.003
She's not a collector.

22:53.043 --> 22:55.927
Neither of my kids are collectors of anything.

22:55.947 --> 22:57.850
Laura Kett was saying this, and his wife.

22:57.910 --> 22:58.651
I said, what did your wife say?

22:58.671 --> 22:59.612
Should I know Laura Kett?

22:59.632 --> 23:00.053
I don't know.

23:00.253 --> 23:00.814
Night Court.

23:01.314 --> 23:02.736
Oh, I don't know.

23:02.756 --> 23:03.497
The tall guy who plays.

23:03.577 --> 23:05.159
I don't watch television, but I found out.

23:05.320 --> 23:05.760
I see.

23:05.780 --> 23:08.764
The tall guy who plays the sex star of the lawyer.

23:09.465 --> 23:10.567
I don't watch television either.

23:10.587 --> 23:13.030
I mean, I heard that he's very... I do watch television, but I don't know.

23:13.210 --> 23:13.451
Really?

23:13.571 --> 23:14.192
Yeah.

23:14.212 --> 23:15.934
But, you know, anyway.

23:16.370 --> 23:20.055
And he said, well, I started buying books for my wife, Ann Tyler.

23:21.377 --> 23:25.543
So then when I went in to see the collection, I said, John, problem here.

23:25.824 --> 23:29.509
I said, these books, they're in your collection.

23:30.671 --> 23:33.154
I said, you didn't buy these for your wife.

23:33.395 --> 23:35.017
I said, you bought these for yourself.

23:35.077 --> 23:38.041
I mean, I really heartily endorsed the collecting of Ann Tyler.

23:38.101 --> 23:38.762
She's wonderful.

23:38.782 --> 23:39.323
She's wonderful.

23:40.485 --> 23:40.905
Yeah, exactly.

23:41.246 --> 23:41.967
And he smiled.

23:41.987 --> 23:42.748
He said, well...

23:42.931 --> 23:45.375
I want to take care of them, but I said, they have pride of place.

23:46.197 --> 23:47.719
How are they arranged?

23:47.740 --> 23:48.601
Yeah, well, they're right there.

23:48.641 --> 23:49.943
They're all signed in their name.

23:51.246 --> 23:51.386
Really?

23:51.406 --> 23:53.950
I have a nice Antarctica collection, too.

23:53.971 --> 23:56.936
Yeah, she's wonderful.

23:56.956 --> 23:57.437
I agree with her.

23:57.457 --> 24:04.990
You said we were talking, you have to talk to, so, I think your wife described you once as a...

24:05.290 --> 24:09.096
She used a psychology term, Freudian.

24:09.136 --> 24:11.680
She's a therapist, so it would be appropriate.

24:11.700 --> 24:12.501
I don't remember that.

24:14.484 --> 24:17.629
You describe yourself as an anal personality.

24:17.649 --> 24:18.450
Right, yeah.

24:18.530 --> 24:20.813
Is that something you want to keep on the record?

24:21.574 --> 24:22.276
Sure, I don't care.

24:22.336 --> 24:24.279
I think it fits.

24:25.260 --> 24:29.867
Well, I mean, as you know, there are times when you feel that you are nuts.

24:30.087 --> 24:31.690
I mean, this is just crazy.

24:31.710 --> 24:33.913
This is insane.

24:34.940 --> 24:37.283
Tell me how you enjoy the collection.

24:38.104 --> 24:41.609
Now it's a box.

24:41.629 --> 24:44.713
Are you having any anxiety about this?

24:44.813 --> 24:45.854
Any anxiety attacks?

24:45.875 --> 24:58.111
Well, yes, I do have anxiety attacks, and in fact, when we first moved the stuff into storage, there was a leak in the room, and I panicked.

24:58.151 --> 25:01.335
There was very little damage, but it was very scary.

25:01.805 --> 25:09.033
But it's in very good, you know, pretty safe conditions now and so forth.

25:10.935 --> 25:14.278
And, well, I mean, I think it probably is the same for everybody.

25:14.298 --> 25:16.200
I think the chase is part of the fun, too.

25:16.220 --> 25:21.506
I mean, just looking for a book that you, you know, is hard to find is a lot of fun.

25:22.166 --> 25:22.787
It's wonderful.

25:22.807 --> 25:23.288
Yeah, a lot of fun.

25:23.308 --> 25:23.668
It's thrilling.

25:23.768 --> 25:25.210
Yeah, thrilling, exactly.

25:25.230 --> 25:25.390
It is.

25:25.410 --> 25:27.112
It's like winning at the crap table.

25:27.312 --> 25:28.293
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

25:28.313 --> 25:28.613
With that done.

25:29.014 --> 25:29.494
Exactly.

25:29.554 --> 25:30.395
Occasionally.

25:30.495 --> 25:31.356
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:31.994 --> 25:38.043
To find something that you'd have been... I got a call from Bob Fleck down at Okinaw.

25:38.063 --> 25:42.769
I'd been looking for Lessing Rosenwald's Recollections of a Collector, which was only done in 250 copies.

25:42.789 --> 25:47.877
And he published it, but it's very important to my study.

25:47.897 --> 25:53.905
He called, he had it, and it was inscribed from Lessing to... I was overjoyed.

25:54.005 --> 25:56.008
I couldn't wait for it to arrive.

25:56.028 --> 25:56.409
Yeah, I know.

25:56.429 --> 25:57.450
I know, that's very exciting.

25:57.510 --> 25:59.834
And didn't go to bed the night, you know.

25:59.934 --> 26:01.596
I stayed up and read the whole thing.

26:02.116 --> 26:05.820
He was a wonderful collector.

26:05.840 --> 26:09.023
I do think there's got to be another common denominator.

26:09.043 --> 26:13.587
There's got to be a sort of a basic love for literature.

26:13.607 --> 26:30.503
I mean, I think there are a lot of people who maybe stop reading and so forth, and God knows I haven't read anywhere near books that I've collected, but I think you have to probably have been a reader as a kid that

26:31.765 --> 26:38.596
you know, the name Faulkner, Hemingway has to have the same excitement that Van Gogh or Renoir has for the Japanese.

26:38.656 --> 26:47.811
I mean, I think there is, that there's glamour and excitement in just knowing you've got a book that had been handled by Faulkner or whatever.

26:48.011 --> 26:55.544
Well, and that piece that you wrote, you describe Faulkner's inscribed... To his mother.

26:55.824 --> 26:56.926
Oh, is that Billy?

26:57.246 --> 26:57.587
Yeah.

26:57.787 --> 27:04.737
That would absolutely knock me over.

27:04.878 --> 27:12.609
You mentioned literature, but tell me the difference between the love of literature and the veneration for the object, the artifact.

27:13.551 --> 27:15.674
There is still a leap that you have to make.

27:16.695 --> 27:19.840
What makes this book such a coveted thing?

27:20.040 --> 27:21.242
Why do you want it?

27:21.443 --> 27:27.051
This goes back to your point about the Japanese who spent $120 million on two

27:27.301 --> 27:27.962
two paintings.

27:28.643 --> 27:29.865
And why didn't, what?

27:29.885 --> 27:31.667
150 or whatever it is.

27:32.809 --> 27:36.274
That, you know, he could have built the greatest.

27:36.995 --> 27:37.216
Could have.

27:37.236 --> 27:40.040
Well, he'd have the greatest, but a very respectable library.

27:40.060 --> 27:40.741
A major, major, major.

27:40.761 --> 27:42.644
A very respectable library.

27:44.927 --> 27:54.321
It sounds, and I've read about this guy, that he's a real Philistine, you know, and that he wants down the most expensive Renoir and the most expensive Van Gogh in the world.

27:55.229 --> 27:58.274
he's probably not smart enough to want to collect books, you know?

27:59.035 --> 28:06.367
Because they're not considered glamorous and attractive by, you know, the world at large.

28:06.868 --> 28:11.174
But there's something fundamental, and you mentioned it too, a picture, by the way, you put on the wall.

28:11.194 --> 28:11.815
Yeah.

28:11.835 --> 28:13.238
And you really do present it.

28:13.939 --> 28:14.199
Right.

28:15.261 --> 28:16.122
I mean, people see it.

28:16.202 --> 28:16.463
Yeah.

28:16.603 --> 28:17.645
People don't see your books.

28:19.187 --> 28:21.471
This is really something... They are in my new apartment, I'll tell you.

28:21.491 --> 28:22.873
Yeah, but they...

28:23.309 --> 28:25.653
Only other people who are interested in books.

28:25.873 --> 28:26.554
Yeah, yeah.

28:26.574 --> 28:28.557
No, they never, exactly, exactly.

28:28.577 --> 28:30.019
I was at Leonard Baskin's house.

28:30.280 --> 28:30.500
Really?

28:30.660 --> 28:31.942
Yeah, wonderful.

28:33.224 --> 28:33.805
He and his wife.

28:34.266 --> 28:35.067
How old is he?

28:35.347 --> 28:35.868
Is he, really?

28:35.968 --> 28:36.369
How old?

28:36.689 --> 28:37.931
Yeah.

28:37.951 --> 28:39.954
65, 66, 67.

28:40.736 --> 28:41.657
Right around there.

28:41.677 --> 28:45.944
He told me, and I have it for a while since.

28:45.964 --> 28:47.746
It's underappreciative, I think.

28:47.766 --> 28:50.110
He's great, but he's a wonderful collector.

28:50.461 --> 28:51.803
I was there one afternoon.

28:51.823 --> 28:52.824
It was four hours.

28:52.844 --> 28:53.905
It was a Sunday.

28:53.925 --> 28:54.947
And I was getting embarrassed.

28:55.027 --> 28:57.189
I said, look, I'm loving this.

28:57.269 --> 28:57.970
No, no, stay.

28:58.251 --> 29:00.153
It's not often we get to share.

29:00.273 --> 29:00.553
Right.

29:00.573 --> 29:01.194
It's really true.

29:01.254 --> 29:02.276
And I was with Shitey.

29:02.296 --> 29:04.338
I mean, the same thing has happened time and time again.

29:04.358 --> 29:09.985
When the collector gets, I mean, if your stuff was here, we'd be going.

29:10.005 --> 29:10.666
I mean, I just know.

29:10.826 --> 29:12.068
I mean, I feel very badly.

29:12.348 --> 29:12.829
Exactly.

29:13.109 --> 29:15.692
We'd be going through it, and the time would pass.

29:15.908 --> 29:18.751
And I'd start to apologize, and he'd say, no, no, no.

29:18.951 --> 29:20.013
You haven't seen this yet.

29:20.033 --> 29:21.815
I haven't seen this yet.

29:21.835 --> 29:25.639
And when Scheide went and got his Gutenberg Bible and put it on my lap.

29:25.659 --> 29:27.521
Wow, Jesus.

29:27.541 --> 29:28.182
And I went like this.

29:29.343 --> 29:30.244
And he said, are you OK?

29:30.264 --> 29:31.946
I said, I am a little lightheaded.

29:31.966 --> 29:33.408
I said, this happened.

29:33.488 --> 29:34.169
Oh, Roger.

29:34.289 --> 29:36.652
I'm sorry, but we were saying something about Gordon Ray.

29:36.872 --> 29:40.256
Yeah.

29:40.416 --> 29:44.160
He was a wonderful man and an extraordinary collector as well.

29:44.562 --> 29:46.788
wrote wonderfully about collecting as well.

29:47.309 --> 29:53.084
I'm hopeful that... And there's a case where a lot of his books were at the Morgan and they went to the Morgan.

29:54.246 --> 29:57.314
And that was probably known beforehand.

29:57.334 --> 30:01.204
I'm going to have to Columbia this afternoon where they have some extraordinary...

30:01.690 --> 30:02.812
oral history school.

30:03.072 --> 30:06.538
Oh, yeah, that whole project, that whole Columbia oral history project, yeah.

30:06.558 --> 30:08.060
I had to get permission to see it.

30:08.080 --> 30:08.320
Really?

30:09.021 --> 30:11.746
They didn't even realize I had to get permission.

30:11.886 --> 30:12.367
No kidding.

30:12.567 --> 30:16.573
Gerald Gottlieb, the fellow from the Morgan, did the interviews 20 years ago.

30:16.633 --> 30:16.894
Really?

30:17.034 --> 30:17.154
Yeah.

30:17.214 --> 30:18.676
I got his... Yeah.

30:18.997 --> 30:20.018
Gordon was really wonderful.

30:20.699 --> 30:28.391
I'm going to get myself a cup.

30:28.431 --> 30:29.313
Do you want something more?

30:29.333 --> 30:30.094
No, I'm fine.

30:30.192 --> 30:41.987
I've lost my wife for giving me this expert tape recorder.

30:42.607 --> 30:44.510
I mean, you should talk to the families of collectors.

30:45.030 --> 30:47.914
I mean, the madness aspect of it.

30:47.954 --> 30:52.580
I mean, I think they can give you better stories than anybody about how far it goes.

30:52.960 --> 30:57.786
The other thing, I mean, I know what drives me crazy when I

30:58.205 --> 31:02.450
I have a book and a collection and my wife decides she wants to read it and I just have a fit.

31:04.492 --> 31:06.114
And she says, this is ridiculous.

31:06.154 --> 31:08.737
You can't have books and not read them and so forth.

31:08.977 --> 31:09.758
How do you explain that?

31:11.761 --> 31:24.415
Well, I think that probably gets down to the whole issue of the condition of an object.

31:24.580 --> 31:25.441
It's an artifact.

31:25.482 --> 31:26.463
Yeah, it's an artifact.

31:26.704 --> 31:27.224
Exactly.

31:27.285 --> 31:29.849
It is said that you know you are a collector.

31:29.869 --> 31:32.113
The day you buy a book, you know you will never read.

31:32.333 --> 31:32.714
Right.

31:32.734 --> 31:32.874
Really?

31:32.894 --> 31:33.435
Yeah, that's interesting.

31:33.455 --> 31:35.518
Well, I mean, somebody says that, but it's not bad.

31:36.159 --> 31:37.381
How do you know when you're a collector?

31:37.982 --> 31:39.084
You've always been a collector.

31:39.405 --> 31:39.665
Yeah.

31:40.527 --> 31:42.089
That's important, isn't it?

31:42.129 --> 31:42.610
I think it is.

31:42.811 --> 31:50.824
Certainly in analyzing myself or analyzing how all this started and so forth, it seems to me that that

31:51.631 --> 31:55.756
That instinct was always there, and I look at my own kids, and they really don't have it.

31:55.776 --> 32:00.040
I thought my daughter had it for a while, because she started collecting Archie comic books.

32:00.060 --> 32:04.445
But then I found I was going out and buying her Archie comic books.

32:04.505 --> 32:04.986
What is it?

32:05.006 --> 32:06.968
Do you understand this fascination for things?

32:08.610 --> 32:08.970
I don't know.

32:08.990 --> 32:15.597
I think probably all the Freudian analysis in this is probably very interesting, and I assume it's been written about.

32:15.998 --> 32:17.119
You must have gotten into that.

32:17.139 --> 32:19.341
Not in books.

32:19.982 --> 32:20.963
Really?

32:21.348 --> 32:26.055
I'm told there are some things that I won't get to.

32:26.176 --> 32:31.524
I'm really interested in the stories.

32:31.884 --> 32:34.228
There's a woman in Washington, Marsha Cotter.

32:34.929 --> 32:37.593
She's Larry McMurtry's partner.

32:39.176 --> 32:45.145
She wrote a paper, which I have a copy of, Why Women Don't Collect.

32:45.631 --> 32:46.813
Well, I mean... That's interesting.

32:47.214 --> 32:55.369
I mean, when you think about it, most of... And she admits it, and she says, I see them walk into my store, and they pick up a book, and they don't have the veneration for it.

32:55.389 --> 32:55.610
Yeah, yeah.

32:55.650 --> 32:58.435
And she said, I mean, even kids from high school.

32:58.455 --> 32:59.477
Yeah.

32:59.998 --> 33:03.404
And so she has some theories on that.

33:03.424 --> 33:05.348
I mean, it was really... What were the, what are the theories?

33:05.368 --> 33:09.175
Oh, there's some feminist theory that the woman...

33:09.543 --> 33:17.191
having once been an object herself that, you know, she doesn't have to retain her speed or whatever.

33:17.251 --> 33:20.255
Again, it comes down to who's to say.

33:20.695 --> 33:23.418
But, I mean, there have been some very great women collectors.

33:24.059 --> 33:24.580
Mary Hyde.

33:24.740 --> 33:25.440
Mary Hyde.

33:25.481 --> 33:32.688
Arthur Freeman believes, in his view, she's the greatest living collector.

33:32.708 --> 33:33.249
Of anything.

33:33.970 --> 33:35.972
Of anything.

33:36.796 --> 33:38.058
She's a very interesting story.

33:38.078 --> 33:40.622
She's always been around book collectors, too.

33:40.862 --> 33:43.125
Yeah, I mean, Donald started it, didn't he?

33:43.226 --> 33:43.907
I think, yeah.

33:43.927 --> 33:46.050
I'm going to see a guy in Chicago, Sam Rosenthal.

33:46.070 --> 33:46.791
Have you ever heard of him?

33:46.851 --> 33:48.634
No, but is he part of the, yeah.

33:48.694 --> 33:51.177
Yeah, he's a lawyer, a very, very prominent lawyer.

33:51.658 --> 33:52.700
He's about 90 or so.

33:53.381 --> 33:54.142
Thanks, Tim.

33:54.162 --> 33:58.889
But I understand he went out with Mary long before she met Donald.

33:58.909 --> 33:59.510
Oh, no kidding.

33:59.610 --> 34:00.051
Oh, my God.

34:00.071 --> 34:00.832
She's an attractive woman.

34:00.852 --> 34:01.753
I'm sure she was a real.

34:01.853 --> 34:04.938
Yeah, but I mean, but there's another book collector, book collector.

34:05.018 --> 34:05.759
This is the third.

34:06.180 --> 34:06.280
Yeah.

34:06.513 --> 34:07.955
Yeah.

34:08.316 --> 34:08.736
Interesting.

34:09.097 --> 34:10.058
Yeah, fascinating.

34:10.078 --> 34:12.302
I'm seeing him in a couple of weeks.

34:14.445 --> 34:20.494
If you want to tell me anything you think I should know while I look at my... Well, I assume... I think Michael Thomas would be good to talk to.

34:20.594 --> 34:22.858
And Glenn Horowitz, you presumably know.

34:23.058 --> 34:24.921
I've met... I run into Glenn all the time.

34:24.941 --> 34:25.181
Yeah.

34:25.201 --> 34:26.022
I go to all the auctions.

34:26.062 --> 34:27.865
Yeah, yeah.

34:28.206 --> 34:32.833
He's... I've had a lot of fun with him, and he's got some great stories, certainly.

34:32.993 --> 34:33.594
He's a funny guy.

34:33.634 --> 34:34.495
Yeah, yeah.

34:34.812 --> 34:37.196
A very good dealer, I think, and it's been a big success.

34:37.877 --> 34:40.361
He started out on the Strand, as a matter of fact.

34:40.381 --> 34:41.623
Yeah.

34:41.643 --> 34:49.656
But the three best dealers in my experience in this field have been Ralph and Glenn and Peter Howard, basically.

34:49.676 --> 34:50.217
That's the three.

34:50.397 --> 34:51.940
Yeah, that's the three.

34:53.282 --> 35:01.275
At one point, I think early on, you were kind of suggesting that the collection might go to the New York Public Library, I guess in the beginning.

35:01.610 --> 35:04.494
Well, as I say, I mean, or pieces of it.

35:04.534 --> 35:06.636
I mean, the science fiction did go there.

35:06.736 --> 35:07.117
I don't know.

35:07.137 --> 35:11.242
I think it's going to come down to an economic issue, too.

35:11.302 --> 35:17.109
I mean, I think it's become such a big part of my net worth that I can't, you know.

35:17.590 --> 35:18.972
My children may not be able to eat.

35:19.112 --> 35:20.393
Oh, yeah.

35:20.413 --> 35:22.936
Do you have a figure that you care to share with me?

35:23.137 --> 35:25.139
I'd rather not do that, yeah.

35:25.159 --> 35:26.601
But it's too embarrassing.

35:26.621 --> 35:27.863
Everybody rathers not.

35:27.883 --> 35:29.845
Yeah, too embarrassing.

35:30.584 --> 35:31.645
Except the chef.

35:32.166 --> 35:32.466
Really?

35:32.546 --> 35:33.587
Yeah, well, because he's giving it.

35:33.627 --> 35:34.388
He's giving it.

35:34.448 --> 35:35.349
He's putting values on it.

35:35.369 --> 35:35.969
Right, right.

35:36.209 --> 35:38.091
And he's giving it to institutions.

35:38.512 --> 35:44.397
But you did say, I want everything to be broken up and sold, or you'll quote it as saying it's a little piece, I think.

35:44.418 --> 35:46.099
Well, I don't think anything that categorical.

35:46.319 --> 35:52.565
I mean, I think it's going to, it's, what I've done is large enough that I'm going to be able to do a variety of things with it.

35:53.486 --> 35:59.292
But I guess what I'm kind of probing for here is this,

36:00.031 --> 36:10.462
When Robert Ho's collection went out, he was quoted as a, where would I have gotten my books if it hadn't been for other collections?

36:10.482 --> 36:11.023
Fair point.

36:12.084 --> 36:16.508
I mean, should it all go to the museum and to the library where you can't get access to it?

36:16.608 --> 36:18.090
Well, that's the problem, the access.

36:18.791 --> 36:25.998
On the other hand, look at the Berg collection, and I mean, that's really been wonderful, and it's, I think, served people very well.

36:26.118 --> 36:28.000
It's very well displayed.

36:28.040 --> 36:29.582
I mean, they do great exhibitions.

36:30.068 --> 36:33.872
That collection has been kept together, separately endowed.

36:33.892 --> 36:34.873
I mean, I think that's quite wonderful.

36:34.893 --> 36:36.675
Whereas the Lennox collection hasn't.

36:36.775 --> 36:37.596
No, absolutely not.

36:37.636 --> 36:39.999
Tom Adams last week said, you know, the J.C.

36:40.079 --> 36:44.223
Brown collection, which is where we were, he said, was the first.

36:44.544 --> 36:45.425
It was unique.

36:45.445 --> 36:49.249
And he said, to this day, Brown University doesn't give a nickel to this collection.

36:49.269 --> 36:49.569
Really?

36:49.910 --> 36:50.130
Yeah.

36:50.150 --> 36:52.873
They raise it, and it's here it is, part of Brown.

36:53.273 --> 36:59.400
But one reason it is it retains its character, and it is distinctive, and its focus,

36:59.633 --> 37:01.896
is because they made damn sure that it would.

37:02.857 --> 37:03.799
They built the building.

37:03.819 --> 37:07.023
They gave a half a million dollars, which was not inconsiderable in 1903.

37:08.004 --> 37:09.466
That's a lot of money, right?

37:09.767 --> 37:10.988
And they continue to raise the money.

37:11.008 --> 37:15.074
Then you go over to the Hay Library, which is the Brown University special place.

37:15.094 --> 37:20.581
And he said, but Lennox and Brown were contemporaries, and they were rivals for the same time.

37:21.022 --> 37:22.844
And look what happened at about the same time.

37:23.125 --> 37:27.110
You know, Lennox went here, and it's been absorbed into the main collection.

37:27.150 --> 37:28.131
Nothing wrong with that.

37:28.151 --> 37:28.712
Yeah, yeah.

37:29.215 --> 37:33.139
But Brown's is still the Brown collection with his spirit.

37:33.759 --> 37:35.841
That's kind of a long discourse.

37:35.881 --> 37:37.883
But he had unique things.

37:37.903 --> 37:43.549
Inevitably, I guess, another thing I'd like to discuss, at what point did you decide that books weren't enough?

37:44.770 --> 37:52.357
I guess every serious collector at some point has to go after manuscripts, association copies, presentation copies.

37:52.698 --> 37:53.959
They're really wonderful things.

37:53.979 --> 37:55.000
They're really wonderful things.

37:55.120 --> 37:57.282
Yeah, I think you get very quickly

37:59.590 --> 38:27.488
come to the conclusion that that's what really makes it special, and that's what really makes it important, and that these things are available, and they're unique, and that they have real lasting... I mean, there may be 2,000 copies of a relatively rare first edition or first printing of a modern book, and they can become very scarce, and they can become valuable, but there's nothing really special about it.

38:27.991 --> 38:43.625
Where it does become special is where there are, you know, something that has textual and substantive differences and reveal part of the creative process of the author, and the students will always find that fascinating.

38:44.646 --> 38:55.416
And in the same sense, the connections between, you know, associations, whether it's, you know, Edith Wharton to her gardener or

38:55.835 --> 39:01.883
You know, Hemingway to Fitzgerald, or Hemingway to Edmund Wilson, and so forth, which is my book that I've got.

39:02.303 --> 39:04.967
Well, you do have some unique things, manuscript things.

39:04.987 --> 39:06.849
Well, the Tennessee Williams archive.

39:06.869 --> 39:07.350
Yeah, yeah.

39:07.430 --> 39:08.772
I collect Tennessee Williams.

39:08.792 --> 39:09.012
Really?

39:09.112 --> 39:09.953
Yeah.

39:10.073 --> 39:11.215
I think he's wonderful.

39:11.235 --> 39:12.096
I think he's wonderful, too.

39:12.116 --> 39:12.817
Very underrated.

39:12.877 --> 39:15.881
And the prices for him are very... Very reasonable, yeah.

39:16.021 --> 39:17.383
I collect Tennessee Williams.

39:17.403 --> 39:18.124
I've got everything.

39:19.045 --> 39:19.526
I mean, everything.

39:20.066 --> 39:20.307
Right.

39:20.567 --> 39:22.129
All of them, yeah.

39:22.430 --> 39:25.174
I collect Arthur Miller, who I really enjoy.

39:25.234 --> 39:28.238
I love Tennessee.

39:28.318 --> 39:32.443
I think Williams has lived better than Miller, actually, in a way.

39:32.463 --> 39:33.785
Yeah, but he's a better writer.

39:33.805 --> 39:34.946
A better writer, exactly.

39:35.908 --> 39:38.832
His stage directions are to be read aloud.

39:39.432 --> 39:42.997
He was writing, you'd think, just for the director, but boy, you read these.

39:43.017 --> 39:44.199
Did you read the Maria St.

39:44.219 --> 39:44.960
Juste?

39:44.980 --> 39:46.802
I interviewed her, matter of fact.

39:46.822 --> 39:47.984
It's a wonderful book, I think.

39:48.004 --> 39:50.547
She tells me I should interview Lachlan for the directions.

39:50.695 --> 39:51.276
Oh, really?

39:51.296 --> 39:53.338
Because, you know, they were supposed to get married.

39:53.358 --> 39:54.019
She was supposed to marry him.

39:54.039 --> 39:54.419
I noticed that.

39:54.560 --> 39:55.901
I had no idea about that in the book.

39:55.921 --> 40:03.130
Well, apparently, he started that press because, I mean, he had the money, number one, but he really wanted to publish the people he wanted to collect.

40:03.290 --> 40:03.730
Right, right.

40:03.751 --> 40:05.773
It's an interesting little twist on it.

40:05.793 --> 40:06.734
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

40:07.215 --> 40:08.056
How did you decide?

40:08.596 --> 40:10.539
I mean, did you just start collecting people you liked?

40:11.119 --> 40:11.940
Is that how you did it?

40:11.960 --> 40:13.202
Yeah, that's how I continued the course.

40:13.222 --> 40:14.523
Yeah, right.

40:14.543 --> 40:15.585
I think you have to do that.

40:16.566 --> 40:17.987
I think that I like themes.

40:18.148 --> 40:18.508
I love

40:19.096 --> 40:23.362
I've got a really outstanding collection of literary biographies.

40:23.602 --> 40:26.346
I love this.

40:26.406 --> 40:31.312
I mean, for my work, but I go after them.

40:31.352 --> 40:33.295
I love reading about writers.

40:35.097 --> 40:38.882
And you do go for, when you pick a writer, you go for completeness, not just the high spots.

40:39.002 --> 40:44.049
Yeah, but I've kind of refined it down to first trades.

40:44.189 --> 40:47.854
I mean, these little, I hate them.

40:48.104 --> 40:49.786
I detest them.

40:49.906 --> 40:51.267
Literary prostitution.

40:51.287 --> 40:53.810
I've written piece stories about them.

40:54.310 --> 40:55.791
It's manufactured rarity.

40:56.132 --> 41:02.018
It's taking something and deciding that we're only going to do 150 copies of this.

41:02.418 --> 41:09.465
You know, the marketplace is such that let's do a first printing, and if it's good, then we'll go into the second printing.

41:09.505 --> 41:14.410
Now, if you're perspicacious enough to buy this author, it's the marketplace.

41:14.470 --> 41:17.993
I'm really interested in the marketplaces, not the perception of the writer.

41:18.142 --> 41:22.907
I love having a couple of John Cheever things, first editions, with remainder stamps on them.

41:23.007 --> 41:23.828
Right, right, absolutely.

41:24.088 --> 41:25.189
That tells you something.

41:25.229 --> 41:28.132
That doesn't bother me when they say it's got a remainder stamp on it, really.

41:28.973 --> 41:30.255
No, it doesn't bother me either.

41:30.335 --> 41:33.398
That means that the Wap Shop didn't sell out its first edition.

41:33.538 --> 41:37.923
It's like finding a Rembrandt in a junk shop, exactly.

41:37.943 --> 41:39.104
That's right.

41:39.124 --> 41:43.829
The other thing I think it really came to do with it is the whole proof thing.

41:43.869 --> 41:48.013
That's the mistake I made in the beginning, was collecting a lot of proofs.

41:49.192 --> 41:52.035
You're the first person to talk to me about it, which is worth my having.

41:52.055 --> 41:52.356
Really?

41:52.736 --> 41:57.421
I think, you know, in a way, it's kind of an artificial rarity, too.

41:57.502 --> 42:02.587
I mean, if there are textual differences, it has some independent value.

42:03.268 --> 42:13.520
But just as, I mean, the first appearance of the book, and then which, I mean, it's the galleys, it's the corrected galleys, I mean, those are fascinating documents.

42:13.560 --> 42:13.680
Okay.

42:14.048 --> 42:15.630
I got this thing to be really complete.

42:15.650 --> 42:22.499
You wanted to have the proof and then the, you know, the copy of Rabbit Run and so forth, and they sell for big prices.

42:22.539 --> 42:27.205
Well, I'll shut this off if you're interested in it.

42:28.167 --> 42:36.017
Well, Robert Stone's last book, I've forgotten the title of it, but I was reading it in proof.

42:36.077 --> 42:38.360
It was the Hollywood one about the actress.

42:38.380 --> 42:40.663
Yeah, and he put the liver on the wrong side of the body.

42:40.863 --> 42:41.343
Oh, really?

42:41.624 --> 42:48.551
And I called Knopf, and I told him, and they wrote me a letter, and Bob wrote me a letter, and they fixed it.

42:49.031 --> 42:55.058
It's a small thing, but he said, do you have any idea how many doctors I hear from?

42:56.159 --> 42:57.640
Yeah, exactly.

42:57.861 --> 42:58.982
I've always wondered about it.

42:59.002 --> 43:00.303
I mean, have you read the book in proof?

43:00.443 --> 43:00.744
Yeah.

43:00.764 --> 43:01.284
To review it?

43:01.364 --> 43:02.105
Yeah.

43:02.786 --> 43:08.912
And I called, feeling that they might have some time to fix it, but I kept the correspondence, and

43:09.179 --> 43:12.162
So personally, for me, it's a... Yeah.

43:12.182 --> 43:15.345
But it's such a... So what do you do with the proofs you don't want to keep?

43:16.907 --> 43:17.908
I give them away.

43:17.928 --> 43:18.288
Give them away?

43:18.308 --> 43:19.009
Yeah.

43:19.029 --> 43:22.252
Because I know Glenn Horowitz had a thriving business with the Times reviewers.

43:22.272 --> 43:27.197
I mean, they would... Well, that's what I'm supposed to do with it, you know?

43:27.217 --> 43:27.337
Right.

43:27.357 --> 43:27.917
I don't know why not.

43:28.037 --> 43:29.939
But really, the only ones that are worth anything are fiction.

43:30.079 --> 43:30.760
Yeah, yeah.

43:31.040 --> 43:32.942
Proofs, I mean... Proof, yeah, exactly.

43:33.102 --> 43:34.944
They're really junk for the most part.

43:34.964 --> 43:35.325
Right.

43:35.345 --> 43:38.848
And I've really found that... I would never go out and buy one.

43:39.419 --> 43:39.879
personal.

43:40.540 --> 43:42.082
I just don't, I agree with you.

43:43.303 --> 43:47.227
But a dealer will really try and convince you that you have to.

43:47.247 --> 43:56.316
I had a big, big, long discussion with Ralph, I mean, not, I guess about a year ago, because he bought all these Steinbeck proofs for huge prices.

43:57.116 --> 44:03.323
And he was asking huge prices, you know, $8,000, $10,000, $12,000 for proofs that just happened.

44:03.343 --> 44:05.945
I mean, there was no real substantive difference and so forth.

44:05.965 --> 44:07.907
And he, I think he obviously thought I would be

44:08.292 --> 44:15.122
one of the prime customers for those, and I didn't order anything, and he called me up and he said, you're not interested in these proofs?

44:15.142 --> 44:16.083
And I said, I'm really not.

44:16.144 --> 44:17.085
This is just crazy.

44:17.726 --> 44:21.191
And I don't know whether he unloaded them or not, but I just don't get it.

44:21.211 --> 44:25.517
If you gave me a choice between something signed by an author... I agree.

44:25.537 --> 44:29.283
...or a proof... I totally agree with you.

44:29.303 --> 44:31.186
...a signed book any day of the year.

44:31.206 --> 44:33.008
And I don't care who it's inscribed to, either.

44:33.129 --> 44:36.173
More people think that they'd rather have just one signed than inscribed.

44:36.507 --> 44:37.709
I'd rather have one inscribed.

44:37.729 --> 44:38.430
There's more to it.

44:38.450 --> 44:39.311
There's like a little letter.

44:39.351 --> 44:40.413
There's something there.

44:40.433 --> 44:41.495
There's a history to it.

44:41.515 --> 44:48.246
However, the proof of Sam and the Fury would probably be $25,000, $30,000, I would think, or Sun Also Rises or whatever.

44:49.728 --> 44:54.656
Have you ever felt that... I mean, I've talked to some people.

44:54.696 --> 44:55.998
This guy Zinman.

44:56.018 --> 44:57.039
You ever have Michael Zinman?

44:57.400 --> 45:00.545
Yeah, I've heard the name, yeah.

45:00.565 --> 45:00.705
Crazy.

45:00.725 --> 45:01.426
I mean, wild.

45:01.486 --> 45:01.887
Wild, yeah.

45:01.907 --> 45:02.969
Wild, yeah.

45:03.269 --> 45:03.730
But...

45:04.351 --> 45:04.992
But he does.

45:05.012 --> 45:05.732
He's got a business.

45:07.074 --> 45:09.676
He's got three houses filled.

45:09.716 --> 45:12.679
His imprint collection is extraordinary.

45:12.699 --> 45:20.567
But he said up until two years ago, they didn't go by where he wasn't in debt to some dealer or another.

45:20.587 --> 45:20.967
I don't know.

45:21.248 --> 45:29.256
I mean, you certainly have a different... Oh, I've carried big balances with all the... Despite your lineage as well.

45:29.356 --> 45:29.936
Yeah, exactly.

45:29.956 --> 45:31.718
Oh, absolutely.

45:31.738 --> 45:33.700
And in fact, you know,

45:34.135 --> 45:37.638
Not a fair amount of trading and, you know, in kind and so forth.

45:38.900 --> 45:43.004
I think I'm out of debt at the moment, unless I buy this book from Ralph, and I'll be back in debt again.

45:43.024 --> 45:44.185
But at the moment, I'm out of debt.

45:44.205 --> 45:49.490
I'm told that there was a Vanderbilt, by the way, who was quite a collector down in South Carolina, who built a $200 million.

45:49.570 --> 45:50.571
Oh, the North Carolina jewelry.

45:50.591 --> 45:51.312
Yeah, yeah.

45:51.912 --> 45:53.954
I mean, is that... I've seen the house.

45:54.014 --> 45:54.355
I don't know.

45:54.415 --> 45:57.237
I don't know whether both of the... Somebody just mentioned that to me.

45:57.878 --> 45:57.978
Yeah.

45:57.998 --> 46:01.982
What's really disappointing about the Vanderbilts is they built all these huge houses and

46:02.401 --> 46:05.347
But they bought terrible art, and they bought books by the yard.

46:05.407 --> 46:08.353
I mean, they bought, you know, that generation did.

46:08.373 --> 46:12.361
Well, Henry Huntington did beautifully with books, but his art tasted terrible.

46:12.381 --> 46:18.854
But I mean, Vanderbilt nowhere approached what he did or what the Widener did or what any of them.

46:18.874 --> 46:24.325
And it would have been, they probably spent as much money, you know, buying these sets and stuff.

46:25.148 --> 46:26.429
Huntington is fascinating.

46:26.449 --> 46:30.353
I've gone through all of his correspondence at the Rosenbach.

46:30.533 --> 46:32.574
I love those books.

46:33.355 --> 46:35.757
Did you talk to John Fleming before he died?

46:36.037 --> 46:37.339
Missed him.

46:37.359 --> 46:38.380
No, I've missed a few.

46:38.680 --> 46:42.583
Zeitlin, by the way, left quite a nice oral history on L.A., so I'm getting that.

46:42.603 --> 46:43.564
Oh, great.

46:43.884 --> 46:45.125
And Howell left one.

46:45.165 --> 46:47.447
I'm getting Howell's oral history.

46:47.467 --> 46:49.529
And going up, Lou Feldman left an oral history.

46:49.549 --> 46:50.070
Did he really?

46:50.270 --> 46:50.790
Yeah.

46:50.810 --> 46:55.054
That was before my time, but I gather he was quite a... Well, I have a chapter at the University of Texas

46:55.355 --> 46:56.076
Really?

46:56.517 --> 46:56.757
Yeah.

46:56.777 --> 46:57.017
Fascinating.

46:57.037 --> 46:57.758
Yeah, that would be fascinating.

46:57.778 --> 46:59.180
Institutional bibliomania.

46:59.441 --> 46:59.541
Yeah.

46:59.561 --> 47:00.222
Without question.

47:00.242 --> 47:00.582
Yeah.

47:00.602 --> 47:02.966
I had a blank check, Texas style.

47:03.126 --> 47:04.868
I spent five days down there.

47:04.908 --> 47:05.890
And look what they got.

47:05.910 --> 47:06.611
I've never seen it.

47:06.651 --> 47:07.452
I would love to get it.

47:07.532 --> 47:08.454
Good for you.

47:08.474 --> 47:08.574
Yeah.

47:08.754 --> 47:13.220
So many people wrap them, but they bought a lot of shit, some people say.

47:13.280 --> 47:14.702
And then, you know Nicholas Parker?

47:14.762 --> 47:15.544
I'm dropping names.

47:15.724 --> 47:16.124
Yeah.

47:16.164 --> 47:17.166
But I asked people.

47:17.186 --> 47:17.667
You know what he said?

47:18.247 --> 47:22.273
He said, you know, we're just discovering some 16th century writers now

47:22.726 --> 47:24.529
We're just discovering now that they're good.

47:24.649 --> 47:25.971
Absolutely.

47:26.091 --> 47:29.315
And I think this is a pertinent point for you to make, because you have 6,000 copies.

47:29.355 --> 47:32.059
A lot of people might say, hey, a lot of these people are worthless.

47:32.320 --> 47:35.624
And you might say, well, they're worthless now, in your view.

47:36.526 --> 47:39.750
But nobody looked at Melville until they discovered Billy Budd in the 1920s.

47:39.850 --> 47:48.683
And Texas is buying some stuff that may, in the view of some critics, be worthless.

47:49.085 --> 47:49.726
But who's to judge?

47:49.746 --> 47:51.848
Well, that's such a subjective judgment, anyway.

47:51.868 --> 47:55.012
Subjective, but I think that what they've done is pretty spectacular.

47:55.252 --> 47:58.355
They have mainly focused on 20th century manuscripts.

47:58.736 --> 48:01.799
They went after stuff that nobody else was going, that was available.

48:01.819 --> 48:04.943
They got all that, I mean, fabulous archives, right, exactly.

48:04.963 --> 48:06.785
And they take care of it beautifully.

48:06.805 --> 48:07.826
I don't know if you've been down there.

48:07.846 --> 48:08.567
I've never been down there.

48:08.587 --> 48:09.007
I want to see it.

48:09.047 --> 48:09.808
Gorgeous.

48:10.008 --> 48:10.929
Well, it's not gorgeous.

48:10.949 --> 48:11.810
It's like a fortress.

48:12.091 --> 48:13.993
The Beinecke is beautiful.

48:14.013 --> 48:14.113
Yeah.

48:14.684 --> 48:16.947
back in the contrast, the two buildings.

48:17.668 --> 48:18.690
His attitude is there.

48:19.331 --> 48:22.154
You walk into Texas, and it's like they've got Uzis.

48:22.335 --> 48:27.642
I mean, they don't, but it's a bank of streets and cars, and there were no windows.

48:27.883 --> 48:34.151
And of course, the Beinecke is like a fountain of books, and it's very inviting.

48:35.153 --> 48:37.736
But this is the Ivy League, and this is Texas.

48:38.237 --> 48:40.320
I always thought, I mean, often,

48:40.672 --> 48:45.058
I thought about that a lot when I had all my books were out and they will be out again.

48:45.098 --> 48:58.377
And I said, you know, if somebody could just walk in here and if they knew what they were doing, I mean, walk away with three or four things worth a lot of money that it would take me months to notice were gone.

49:00.000 --> 49:04.186
And the only protection you have against that is that people don't know and don't care.

49:05.067 --> 49:06.950
You know how many people have said that to me?

49:07.310 --> 49:09.413
This guy Zindan, for instance, has a house.

49:10.051 --> 49:13.799
that his wife doesn't know about.

49:13.819 --> 49:14.260
Jesus.

49:14.781 --> 49:15.102
I got it.

49:15.122 --> 49:18.569
Bradley Martin was very sort of paranoid about his books, wasn't he?

49:18.589 --> 49:19.431
Yeah, well, paranoid.

49:19.451 --> 49:20.032
Yeah, he should have.

49:20.052 --> 49:21.295
Well, exactly.

49:21.736 --> 49:23.379
We're talking about a whole other category.

49:23.499 --> 49:24.782
Right, exactly, yeah.

49:25.524 --> 49:27.528
But I said, Michael, you don't even lock the house.

49:28.630 --> 49:28.971
He said,

49:29.339 --> 49:32.583
people come in here aren't going to be interested in this grungy old book.

49:33.123 --> 49:36.087
I said, they might pull them off the shelves looking for the money.

49:37.488 --> 49:39.991
But they're not interested in an Eliot Bible book.

49:40.011 --> 49:42.955
And there is some merit to that.

49:43.655 --> 49:48.621
As I'm building my library now, and I'm thinking, this is going to be visible from the street.

49:48.701 --> 49:50.784
But who cares about books?

49:51.424 --> 49:52.225
Very few people.

49:53.467 --> 49:56.430
I at least had most of my value ones upstairs where people didn't always go.

49:56.490 --> 49:59.093
But in this new apartment, they're all going to be in the living room.

49:59.748 --> 50:01.534
You know, when you have a party or something.

50:02.737 --> 50:05.446
Tell me, what time is your next day?

50:06.128 --> 50:07.211
Oh, I'm good till 1.

50:07.231 --> 50:12.407
I'm just going to change this tape to the other side before it runs out.
