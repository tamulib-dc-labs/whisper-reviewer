WEBVTT

00:08.182 --> 00:11.225
Remember?

00:13.948 --> 00:22.637
We were at the ending, we were talking about the ending of November 5th.

00:22.657 --> 00:33.988
I intend that it, although, I intend it to be a positive ending.

00:35.169 --> 00:36.771
It's Richard Yates kind of ending, is it?

00:39.316 --> 00:40.878
You say it is?

00:40.898 --> 00:42.780
It is not?

00:43.421 --> 00:43.702
No.

00:44.222 --> 00:45.944
No, I don't think it's not.

00:45.964 --> 00:48.548
It's not bitterness.

00:50.290 --> 00:57.459
Talk to me about five minutes about Richard Gates.

00:58.140 --> 01:05.069
I first met Richard Gates at Iowa.

01:05.089 --> 01:06.170
He came there as my teacher.

01:07.392 --> 01:09.154
He was, we all lost in the Institute.

01:09.961 --> 01:16.169
because he immediately went out drinking those.

01:16.430 --> 01:24.220
So every class, when Richard Gates would meet once a week, they would all end up at a bar in Iowa City.

01:25.522 --> 01:30.028
And we were all young married.

01:30.909 --> 01:34.054
Almost all the students then were married and had kids.

01:34.835 --> 01:38.820
There were a handful who were single, but for most part,

01:39.914 --> 01:40.795
We were all married.

01:42.457 --> 01:53.268
And Jerry Williams was single, one of the handful.

01:55.550 --> 02:02.398
And once a week, the class sessions, the drinking sessions, we end up going to someone calling home.

02:02.998 --> 02:09.465
Actually, we say we're going to have, you know, we're going over someone's house.

02:09.985 --> 02:15.171
Andre's house, when he goes to my house, that's how I'm his friend.

02:15.271 --> 02:18.174
And I remember when the comedy had never parted his goal.

02:18.194 --> 02:28.126
So, and Richard Yates, he's always kind of at the center of this, and of course he loved it, because it was a kind of drinking thing that he liked.

02:28.226 --> 02:35.073
And he was telling his story, and he was, he was very fun to be around, and he had wonderful sentiment.

02:35.093 --> 02:37.076
He was very sentimental over the office.

02:37.096 --> 02:39.098
He had a sentiment that,

02:39.533 --> 02:44.039
but I'm a child, you know, and I've been a person.

02:44.059 --> 02:51.889
And you play old music and tell stories and leave you up before four o'clock in the morning.

02:51.909 --> 02:57.396
There is a kind of a, I do sense of sort of parity.

02:57.416 --> 03:08.190
A lot of the characters, I mean, there is this sympathy with me, the damage, and there's a sort of frustration in a lot of, maybe I'm reaching just a little too,

03:09.588 --> 03:25.571
He was always regarded as a writer's writer, and I remember asking him, you know, and it was a matter of some agitation to him that he couldn't really make it as a commercial writer.

03:25.831 --> 03:30.978
I mean, I really had a, he needed these site credits and these scholarships and things like that.

03:31.719 --> 03:35.224
And he said, if I knew how to write a bestseller, he said, I'm going to do it in five minutes.

03:35.404 --> 03:36.526
I don't know how to do it.

03:36.546 --> 03:38.008
He said, I mean, I write what I write.

03:39.575 --> 03:49.306
I'm sure we all do.

03:49.366 --> 03:55.152
We're all running to support our habits, and we'd love to do what we do.

03:55.172 --> 03:56.774
I'm sure you do.

03:59.217 --> 04:00.298
Why not?

04:00.438 --> 04:04.343
Just to support yourself.

04:04.363 --> 04:07.506
Well, you know, your character here is

04:08.752 --> 04:22.686
I'm sure you do a hell of a job for us, but you hate this.

04:22.906 --> 04:27.031
I think that's what you're saying right now.

04:27.671 --> 04:36.160
Tell me about the development of your part.

04:37.186 --> 04:45.600
How would you characterize... I'm sure you see it as a corpus, if there is a body report, isn't it?

04:45.620 --> 04:50.348
One where it has more or less led into the next one.

04:50.368 --> 05:02.147
I mean, the true detective does seem to be one that's had a lot of the track, a little bit, but... Well, certainly my first novel, which I wrote almost accidentally,

05:03.629 --> 05:07.873
I did not set out to write that novel, in fact.

05:07.893 --> 05:13.458
I mean, I didn't know where it was going as I wrote it.

05:17.021 --> 05:26.970
But I wanted to write a novel, and it's pretty much an autobiographical novel.

05:26.990 --> 05:31.094
In fact, what happened is I told a couple short stories.

05:31.114 --> 05:33.096
I came here to teach that

05:33.245 --> 05:40.752
You lived in New Hampshire for quite a while, haven't you?

05:40.913 --> 05:43.895
Yeah, since 1960.

05:44.536 --> 05:45.357
What's the day this?

05:46.118 --> 05:47.539
Just about, yeah.

05:49.161 --> 05:49.641
Not quite.

05:49.681 --> 05:51.703
Not quite.

05:52.804 --> 05:53.765
I told a couple stories.

05:54.085 --> 05:58.210
In fact, one day, a story taken by a New Yorker, a story taken by a black man.

05:58.230 --> 05:58.310
Wow.

05:58.330 --> 05:58.790
That's fine.

05:58.810 --> 06:00.512
That's fine in New York the same day.

06:00.932 --> 06:01.733
And you were doing this?

06:01.949 --> 06:03.190
I did it myself.

06:03.290 --> 06:04.392
I came in the mail.

06:04.552 --> 06:06.354
These were acceptances.

06:06.514 --> 06:08.256
Letters in the mail.

06:08.316 --> 06:10.618
Well, there's a date.

06:10.638 --> 06:13.001
The rest of the letter is a date.

06:13.661 --> 06:15.343
It's 1967.

06:16.804 --> 06:28.336
And my colleagues and friends at the University of Massachusetts, Tom Williams, novelists, John Young, Mark Smith, they all had novels out there.

06:29.017 --> 06:31.720
And I wanted to write a novel.

06:32.797 --> 06:41.950
I was put in touch with their various editors and met with them.

06:41.970 --> 06:46.616
And they began to make me offers on the basis of these coupled stories.

06:46.636 --> 06:50.262
And I said, these will be chapters in this novel I'm going to write.

06:50.702 --> 06:59.354
And so they offered me various advances and they got into a bit of a bidding thing.

06:59.374 --> 07:02.719
And so I ended up with Random House.

07:02.952 --> 07:13.303
to do a first novel, and they gave me, what, it was $15,000 advance, which at the time was one of the $1,000 advance, which was pretty standard.

07:13.323 --> 07:14.824
For a first novel, that's right.

07:14.924 --> 07:16.947
Yeah, for a first novel.

07:16.967 --> 07:26.056
In fact, I took a year off from teaching, and in fact, I tried to write a novel, but I didn't know where I was going with it.

07:26.076 --> 07:26.857
So how did you see it?

07:26.997 --> 07:29.620
Well, it was a little bit fun.

07:29.640 --> 07:29.820
Oh, yeah.

07:30.307 --> 07:35.233
school ended and I started writing this thing and throughout the summer I knocked off 200 pages.

07:35.353 --> 07:38.756
All I knew was I wanted to do a father and son story.

07:39.698 --> 07:46.225
And so I started with the childhood of the father.

07:46.866 --> 07:49.268
So I invented it.

07:49.288 --> 07:54.094
And of course I didn't know quite what I was getting into.

07:54.134 --> 07:58.018
Maybe I was influenced by Thomas Wolfe.

07:58.927 --> 08:11.983
I was going for the big thing, and after about 200-some pages, I realized that if I continued at that pace in the scope, I would have a 5,000-page novel.

08:12.003 --> 08:25.459
It just started working, so I bagged that and started over from the point of view of The Sun, but as a child growing up.

08:25.740 --> 08:28.343
I was doing it chronologically.

08:28.643 --> 08:34.989
I wrote another 50 or 60 pages into that, and that clearly wasn't worth it.

08:35.009 --> 08:40.934
By then, this year that I'd taken off to live on the advance, I was into November, this time of year.

08:41.775 --> 08:42.676
I had a little study.

08:42.896 --> 08:58.330
I lived out in the country, and I had a separate shed with a window, looked over a field, and after the second failed attempt of living on this money, I was striking the brighter spot.

08:58.934 --> 09:05.320
The only time in my life is I was so tense and tight, I couldn't do anything.

09:05.340 --> 09:08.543
What year is this again?

09:08.563 --> 09:11.126
This was, um, in 1968.

09:11.146 --> 09:15.750
Um, this lasted about two weeks, and I lived with it as a kind of secret.

09:15.770 --> 09:18.273
I didn't tell even my wife.

09:18.893 --> 09:23.177
I'd go out to my shed each day, and... You worked in a shed?

09:23.538 --> 09:27.962
Yeah, we were in a shed with windows hooked up on a few... Barrington.

09:28.465 --> 09:50.187
And then finally one day, the first snowfall of the year came, and for some reason I said to myself, take the kid, go to the heart of the problem, put him in a stolen car, have it be in a snowstorm, and I started writing.

09:50.307 --> 09:51.648
It was snowing way up, right?

09:51.668 --> 09:54.511
Yeah, and that came, that's the opening.

09:54.591 --> 09:58.455
Yeah, sure, I was about to say, why did the opening chapter here be arrested?

09:58.874 --> 10:01.857
This novel must have brought to a number of lives here.

10:02.178 --> 10:03.839
A very invariant.

10:03.859 --> 10:08.524
Some of the first couple of attempts didn't deal with any of this at all.

10:09.365 --> 10:12.949
I didn't begin with this arrest situation.

10:13.029 --> 10:13.289
Yeah.

10:13.349 --> 10:14.611
No, anyway, I didn't.

10:14.811 --> 10:17.134
The father was riding the rail.

10:17.154 --> 10:18.055
In the first attempt.

10:18.175 --> 10:19.536
In the young man.

10:19.896 --> 10:20.958
In the depression.

10:20.978 --> 10:22.299
Yeah, it was quite remarkable.

10:22.319 --> 10:27.885
And, of course, winning the city is also from the viewpoint of a teenage kid, too.

10:28.355 --> 10:36.488
I mean, I've already said that if Catra and the Ride would be written today, it would be marketed as a non-adult novel.

10:36.989 --> 10:43.479
Because, I mean, it's one of the no-no's today is you can't wait for the adult trade market.

10:44.240 --> 10:50.530
It's still right from the viewpoint of a teenager, 15, 16, 17-year-old kid.

10:50.550 --> 10:50.791
Yeah.

10:50.991 --> 10:54.717
I mean, I'll bet you there's a problem today trying to sell that kind of

10:55.726 --> 10:58.870
In fact, it's carried in libraries.

10:59.051 --> 11:00.573
It's marked as a YA.

11:01.314 --> 11:01.614
Is it?

11:01.634 --> 11:02.676
That was just my guess.

11:02.696 --> 11:04.779
I saw it in the library the other day.

11:05.580 --> 11:06.782
Of course, it's library.

11:08.063 --> 11:13.151
I noticed what kind of shelf it had with a YA label on it.

11:13.571 --> 11:16.055
What do you think of that?

11:16.075 --> 11:16.716
I'm not sure.

11:16.816 --> 11:19.820
No, I certainly intended it as an adult novel.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.823
Without question, are themes there?

11:22.224 --> 11:22.324
Yeah.

11:23.485 --> 11:24.687
They are all adult themes.

11:25.747 --> 11:30.992
I mean, I'm happy with the notion that I've got a lot of nice attention.

11:31.012 --> 11:37.758
I did letters from schools and teachers and so on, saying to kids' office, they did this book in their class.

11:37.998 --> 11:39.439
It was a discovery book for me.

11:39.620 --> 11:43.383
I'm just delighted to have read it.

11:43.743 --> 11:44.744
Oh, thank you.

11:44.985 --> 11:51.871
I mean, I've become a fan, you know, very quickly, in a couple of weeks.

11:52.071 --> 11:53.172
I'm really pleased with that.

11:53.489 --> 11:58.294
kids, high school kids, and so on, we didn't identify and like it.

11:58.354 --> 12:12.046
Have any of your editors, again, this is now, but did they say he's good from Big Tech, kind of so, right from the viewpoint of a teenager?

12:12.066 --> 12:16.471
Was there any concern there, or there wasn't?

12:16.831 --> 12:18.312
No, it was never.

12:18.613 --> 12:21.235
When the marketing people didn't determine

12:22.143 --> 12:25.127
whether a book is an adult book or for young adults.

12:25.307 --> 12:26.889
This would happen to me, it really would.

12:27.450 --> 12:33.297
I think you'd have a hard time coming in as a brand new writer, trying to play this book.

12:33.657 --> 12:38.604
My friend Robert Cormier has this trouble all the time.

12:39.665 --> 12:45.332
He's been trying to break through it.

12:46.934 --> 12:49.197
Let's see who they have.

12:49.632 --> 12:56.998
He's a king among the... He does very well financially.

12:57.259 --> 12:59.841
He's living modestly.

13:00.802 --> 13:08.809
I mean, he lives very modestly, even upset.

13:08.929 --> 13:18.357
I mean, it's the perception that he writes for young writers, and I don't think that he would necessarily agree with that.

13:19.113 --> 13:29.423
You did mention that this book was, part of the motivation here was to try to remember, recall, what it was like to be a young guy at the end, right?

13:30.103 --> 13:36.589
And I suppose when you were writing the first novel, you were looking back 20 years earlier there, weren't you?

13:37.690 --> 13:40.433
You still kind of went the same thing, maybe?

13:41.694 --> 13:41.834
No.

13:41.854 --> 13:44.176
You did McCarthy?

13:44.216 --> 13:47.179
Oh, it was a story strictly of you, I guess, but...

13:47.750 --> 13:58.444
Oh yeah, certainly that was a story looking back 20, yeah, I guess 20 years ago, prior to my writing it.

13:58.924 --> 14:14.244
And there is this element in this major part of the November fest, certainly.

14:14.264 --> 14:16.727
Living in the city, that's interesting about it,

14:17.602 --> 14:35.730
My editor, I think, Jim Zilliman, is a man older than I am, or a smart guy, never suggests anything of the kind, you know, that it be regarded as a novel.

14:35.850 --> 14:38.915
I'm just wondering out loud on that.

14:40.197 --> 14:42.881
You said you've seen it categorized.

14:42.901 --> 14:43.502
Oh, absolutely.

14:43.522 --> 14:44.183
That's how it is.

14:44.348 --> 14:46.631
That has come to be identified.

14:46.711 --> 14:48.314
Was it a great deal from young readers?

14:49.235 --> 14:50.216
I have, yeah.

14:50.477 --> 14:57.807
I've had a number of letters from kids, high school kids.

14:57.827 --> 15:04.075
I was asked to be a speaker at a certificate granting.

15:04.736 --> 15:05.698
I didn't do it.

15:05.718 --> 15:07.841
It was something I did very comfortably.

15:09.022 --> 15:12.347
A congratulations ceremony because the script

15:13.373 --> 15:16.978
a local group here read Winning the City.

15:17.098 --> 15:17.919
This was a year ago.

15:20.904 --> 15:36.386
Anyway, the final scene in that book, in Winning the City, when the kid buys the first pack of cigarettes, and this page, and one of them smoked, not everyone there, everyone had captured it.

15:36.406 --> 15:42.334
I talked to smoke for the first time, and I intended it to be a statement of

15:43.124 --> 15:47.809
Well, the Declaration of Independence is positive.

15:48.610 --> 15:49.651
This is who I am.

15:50.733 --> 15:53.716
I'm ultimately the winner, because I'm going to accept who I am.

15:54.657 --> 15:59.562
Almost everyone, my friends included, said, oh, let me forget.

15:59.963 --> 16:01.044
Let me put you down there.

16:01.445 --> 16:05.789
Obviously, life is going to go nowhere, because look at me, here you become the smoker.

16:06.350 --> 16:07.772
And that's not what I meant, you know?

16:07.912 --> 16:11.195
And he sort of rose his rose.

16:11.316 --> 16:12.557
Yeah, yeah.

16:13.010 --> 16:14.371
But I think I'm wrong in that one.

16:14.392 --> 16:24.623
In any case, the reason I think of that is because my editor, in terms of age and so on, he never called me on that.

16:24.663 --> 16:29.028
He never said anything in the kind of, do you really want to end on this down?

16:30.729 --> 16:31.070
No.

16:31.110 --> 16:31.771
He didn't say this?

16:31.951 --> 16:32.451
Not at all.

16:32.672 --> 16:35.575
No, and I didn't intend that it be a downer.

16:36.776 --> 16:38.138
Boy, he's been a downer for readers.

16:38.718 --> 16:38.999
Really?

16:39.379 --> 16:42.122
Well, I've heard from so many people, friends and

16:42.423 --> 16:45.827
Most of them are as much as anything else, I suppose.

16:45.907 --> 16:47.348
Most at the end.

16:47.629 --> 16:49.271
Only criminals smoke.

16:49.371 --> 16:50.512
Well, you must have smoked.

16:50.532 --> 16:53.696
I mean, I've been smoking pretty much through everything here.

16:53.716 --> 16:56.158
I mean, that's... I've been caught for 10 years now.

16:56.659 --> 16:57.139
Really?

16:57.239 --> 17:00.944
I mean, the cigarettes really play a major... I mean, they're there.

17:00.964 --> 17:02.986
Everything that I read that you've written.

17:03.106 --> 17:08.532
I mean, the kid, when he's arrested his cigarettes, he gets whacked across the face when he

17:09.035 --> 17:17.985
And then here, I mean, he brings the gift.

17:18.005 --> 17:19.727
The gift is a carton of cigarettes.

17:19.747 --> 17:21.650
I mean, this is the token.

17:21.710 --> 17:27.136
Because she sees it as a, she keeps treating her in the hooker as a street walker, you know.

17:27.156 --> 17:29.419
But you give a chick, I mean, it's a cigarette.

17:29.779 --> 17:36.747
Because when I was on my aircraft carrier, we used to be able to get cartons of cigarettes, and it was like cigarettes, but for a bucket carton, people would say anything.

17:37.385 --> 17:41.170
As soon as the ship leaves, three-mile weather, they went that old bucket cart.

17:41.190 --> 17:42.452
Can you believe this?

17:42.472 --> 17:45.376
That's what I say, $9, 10,000.

17:45.396 --> 17:47.940
Yeah, and this is I'm talking 1968, 69.

17:48.661 --> 17:49.482
Oh, really?

17:50.163 --> 17:50.563
Yeah.

17:50.583 --> 17:55.790
And, I mean, hey, you know, England is Vietnamese.

17:55.810 --> 17:57.112
You're getting bigger.

17:57.132 --> 17:57.413
Anyway.

18:00.136 --> 18:03.141
So, what are you working right now?

18:03.161 --> 18:03.842
Another novel?

18:03.862 --> 18:06.345
I'm doing a new novel, yeah.

18:08.198 --> 18:14.588
It's more invention.

18:15.549 --> 18:18.954
It's really much more invention.

18:19.475 --> 18:25.064
I guess we were talking about following the, you know, started with an autobiographical novel.

18:25.204 --> 18:25.364
Right.

18:25.905 --> 18:30.552
And I think that... You know, there's at least three of them, from what I can see.

18:30.592 --> 18:32.916
I'm kind of branching away with that.

18:32.936 --> 18:34.538
I mean, that's... It's certainly true.

18:34.558 --> 18:36.501
It's actually just entirely researched

18:36.886 --> 18:49.385
and Novemberfest is largely invented, too.

18:49.585 --> 18:58.699
I know what it's like to be a parent, certainly, but I had no experience being a man and a 54-year-old child.

18:59.520 --> 19:06.370
And there's other parts of that, plus the background story

19:06.772 --> 19:09.055
That's not your story.

19:09.716 --> 19:10.717
That's not my story.

19:11.699 --> 19:17.066
I was wondering, too, because, you know, you're this guy driving down in Boston.

19:17.286 --> 19:19.950
Are you teaching in Boston now?

19:19.990 --> 19:23.174
Yeah, I teach at Amerson College.

19:23.194 --> 19:25.477
Okay, and how often do you teach down there?

19:26.198 --> 19:28.642
I go in two or three days a week.

19:28.662 --> 19:32.287
Is this something you're doing now for the pleasure of it or for the employment of it?

19:32.407 --> 19:34.249
For the employment.

19:34.510 --> 19:35.631
I need a lot of income.

19:36.725 --> 19:39.609
so I find maybe three days a week.

19:39.890 --> 19:42.053
So you don't know about your writing there?

19:42.073 --> 19:42.173
Yeah.

19:42.553 --> 19:43.595
No, I'd like to.

19:45.738 --> 19:46.199
Next year.

19:47.400 --> 19:47.981
Yeah, next.

19:49.223 --> 19:50.304
This one's coming out here.

19:50.425 --> 19:58.296
In November 5th, I've had three really wonderful reviews, the trade reviews, the PW Review, Perkins, and the book, and all.

19:58.516 --> 20:01.220
I thought it was really a good answer.

20:02.081 --> 20:05.887
I wouldn't, you know, have a TBR done in this time?

20:05.907 --> 20:06.107
No.

20:06.610 --> 20:09.073
And what's cut date on this?

20:09.093 --> 20:09.513
November 8th.

20:09.894 --> 20:11.195
That's what they said.

20:11.215 --> 20:14.459
See, I know I haven't gotten my review copy yet.

20:14.479 --> 20:19.465
And my deadline for this piece is November 30th.

20:19.485 --> 20:19.905
Usually P.O.D.

20:19.925 --> 20:21.347
is right out on it today.

20:21.367 --> 20:24.370
And I haven't received any review copies.

20:24.390 --> 20:30.837
There's four weeks late, so I only got copies shipped to Air Express.

20:30.857 --> 20:32.680
That's what happened.

20:32.700 --> 20:33.661
Two seconds.

20:33.681 --> 20:34.862
One week ago.

20:35.281 --> 20:40.206
I think they may say November 8th, but I bet it's not in the book stories yet.

20:40.226 --> 20:41.887
I don't think it is in the book stories.

20:41.907 --> 20:46.051
I haven't heard any word on the game there.

20:46.071 --> 20:46.732
I've heard it.

20:46.832 --> 20:55.019
Now, this is not for my piece, but I mean, a reviewer out-of-the-wood work can take 25 minutes to make a judgment.

20:55.560 --> 20:57.482
It's like a wound, isn't it?

20:57.582 --> 20:58.102
It's like a knife.

20:58.703 --> 20:59.463
Oh, yeah.

21:00.064 --> 21:01.545
Yeah, it's awful.

21:01.705 --> 21:02.807
It means it's hard.

21:03.167 --> 21:03.347
Yeah.

21:04.627 --> 21:09.974
And do you think the person just misunderstood the book?

21:10.174 --> 21:12.458
Well, it's a review in time.

21:12.478 --> 21:17.625
It's a self-indulgent kind of review.

21:17.665 --> 21:20.949
It opens to something like, here's another writer writing about a divorce.

21:20.969 --> 21:31.343
75%, or 5% of the people who tend to get divorced, and 75% of the writers are writing novels about it.

21:32.690 --> 21:37.374
And he uses a few words that I don't want to bring enough.

21:37.394 --> 21:47.743
And concludes with something like, you better off spending your time in your dog world.

21:47.964 --> 21:50.226
I mean, it's just, it's terrible.

21:50.446 --> 21:52.227
It's mucking.

21:52.247 --> 21:53.028
It's mucking.

21:53.048 --> 21:53.388
I hate mucking.

21:53.408 --> 21:55.831
I would never remember when I was looking at it.

21:56.571 --> 21:57.012
I'd kill him.

21:57.292 --> 22:01.376
I can't imagine that time would allow you to do like that.

22:01.396 --> 22:01.836
That's correct.

22:02.879 --> 22:05.682
Because there's no evidence put forward.

22:06.663 --> 22:11.307
He identifies me as a professor of German at the University of New Hampshire.

22:11.327 --> 22:11.628
Wow.

22:11.688 --> 22:16.292
The University of New Hampshire isn't even mentioned in the book.

22:16.312 --> 22:18.474
I did teach there once, just many years ago.

22:18.494 --> 22:21.918
Well, of course, if it's close enough, but you don't teach German.

22:22.378 --> 22:23.259
I don't teach German.

22:23.279 --> 22:25.141
That's a flaw, right there.

22:26.462 --> 22:27.743
That is an invention.

22:28.164 --> 22:29.545
I mean, your guy had

22:29.761 --> 22:30.562
Oh, yes, of course.

22:30.602 --> 22:31.783
It's a total invention.

22:31.923 --> 22:34.006
It's not autobiographical at all.

22:34.266 --> 22:35.127
No way, no.

22:35.347 --> 22:36.809
And you teach writing in Boston.

22:37.029 --> 22:40.553
I teach writing in Boston, yeah.

22:41.794 --> 22:50.724
And the... Well, there's several other actuators in the review of any analogies.

22:50.744 --> 22:53.026
I just don't get into it anyway.

22:53.046 --> 22:56.210
I think we've talked about your development as a writer, haven't we?

22:56.310 --> 22:58.232
You certainly covered that.

22:58.921 --> 23:02.565
You certainly do have a preference for the longer form as opposed to the shorter form.

23:02.585 --> 23:09.531
You have to have the stories, but a lot of the stories have been more or less borrowed from the works and progress of the novels.

23:11.093 --> 23:12.554
That's happened, yeah.

23:13.195 --> 23:28.590
It began to happen in the first place, I guess, with a couple of stories I mentioned, but thereafter, if I were to finish a chapter or an episode that had the shape of the story, I'd pull it out and give it some polish and do it as a story.

23:29.313 --> 23:29.934
So I did it.

23:30.154 --> 23:37.264
I think Carty had stories, I don't know, perhaps half a dozen pieces that published his stories in magazines.

23:37.284 --> 23:39.648
Do you have a reader in mind?

23:39.668 --> 23:43.633
Or are you writing mainly?

23:43.713 --> 23:46.257
You can raise yourself.

23:46.277 --> 23:54.909
I mean, you made a remark a while back about the dictation sort of weakness for the injured and damaged people.

23:55.009 --> 23:57.733
I guess they were quite solid.

23:57.933 --> 24:01.036
writing for a particular reader.

24:01.717 --> 24:21.337
I haven't thought of writing about characters, people who are weak or damaged, but I think I do have a special sort of sympathy for some mythical reader out there whose life will be addressed by what I write.

24:21.738 --> 24:24.901
I find that to be an appealing idea.

24:26.443 --> 24:26.843
I like that.

24:27.447 --> 24:34.013
I've had a good response over the years from young readers.

24:34.093 --> 24:48.127
I've been identified as someone who writes, who's written about adolescence, and I hadn't set out to be a writer about adolescence, but it just happened, by the way.

24:49.888 --> 24:54.853
Someone who writes about adolescence with a particular sympathy or insight or something.

24:54.873 --> 24:57.015
So I would guess if I had a reader in mind,

24:58.312 --> 25:04.840
I'd like to speak to that kind of reader.

25:04.860 --> 25:11.989
I also like certainly to speak to, I'm going to take my writing very seriously.

25:12.009 --> 25:16.214
I would like other writers to admire my work.

25:16.234 --> 25:18.837
That's important to me.

25:20.860 --> 25:21.821
I try hard.

25:22.422 --> 25:26.547
I would like very much to have other writers.

25:27.117 --> 25:34.964
If you've identified as a writer's writer, I'd like to be identified as a writer's writer.

25:35.305 --> 25:46.015
Based on some of the comments that you work at BC, to be the wrong writers that I have, the highest respect for the name.

25:47.016 --> 25:52.561
You send me some of the words and, you know, it's pretty spectacular.

25:52.581 --> 25:53.982
That must be quite nice.

25:54.002 --> 25:56.044
Yeah, that's very satisfying.

25:56.513 --> 26:03.061
You can tell if they're genuine in the remarks that people make or abuse that they hear.

26:04.342 --> 26:09.648
And, yeah, that's how I get down.

26:09.668 --> 26:10.850
Pull something like that out.

26:11.951 --> 26:14.494
Did you say that you built a quiet body of work?

26:16.837 --> 26:22.744
That's reasonable statement, yeah.

26:22.804 --> 26:24.546
Have you yet had

26:24.965 --> 26:28.311
the breakthrough book or are you still looking for that?

26:28.651 --> 26:30.976
I'm still looking for the breakthrough book.

26:30.996 --> 26:49.588
I think my first novel, uh, spoiled me in a way because it was, uh, uh, it was very successful, yeah, beautifully reviewed, uh, and it settled all over the place and, and it was translated and, uh,

26:50.783 --> 26:53.687
And I thought, well, that's what it's all about.

26:53.707 --> 26:56.851
I broke the snow hole, and I'm not just going to go respond.

26:57.592 --> 26:59.555
Did you feel that?

26:59.995 --> 27:01.157
That it's all uphill?

27:01.257 --> 27:04.802
Yeah, well, I mean... I felt it was smooth for a smooth sail.

27:04.822 --> 27:05.062
Smooth sail.

27:05.082 --> 27:05.302
Yeah.

27:06.023 --> 27:09.428
Do you remember how well it did?

27:11.931 --> 27:16.618
I think that in hardcover, it must have sold something around $20,000.

27:16.638 --> 27:16.718
Wow.

27:17.619 --> 27:20.723
And I think $400,000...

27:21.040 --> 27:23.662
It's not in print.

27:23.682 --> 27:27.346
It's not in print.

27:27.526 --> 27:29.528
It's not in print.

27:29.548 --> 27:38.676
I thought vintage, the whole idea was vintage was that they stay in print forever.

27:38.696 --> 27:38.936
Vintage?

27:38.996 --> 27:42.259
That edition has not been available now for a couple of years.

27:42.679 --> 27:45.682
They told me to send it back to them, by the way.

27:45.822 --> 27:47.003
Oh, the copies?

27:47.103 --> 27:47.303
Yeah.

27:47.323 --> 27:50.406
There aren't any in the building.

27:50.622 --> 27:53.246
You know, the cops sent me what they could find.

27:53.266 --> 28:04.020
And, I guess, Gary, technical collaboratively, and I am returning when you did that, you know, when I'm done.

28:04.100 --> 28:06.964
Are they going to do the photography for another edition?

28:06.984 --> 28:12.371
There is nothing beautiful right now planned, but I'm my agent.

28:12.391 --> 28:13.853
Well, don't forget I'm writing for P.W.

28:14.014 --> 28:18.700
I might even have a little, what I write might have a little bit of influence in this area.

28:18.920 --> 28:20.342
I would, I would, uh,

28:20.592 --> 28:30.905
My agent is hoping to place Car Thief and my collection of stories that contained eight stories.

28:33.088 --> 28:38.054
And I always had these title arguments with Eric.

28:38.855 --> 28:46.405
The name of the collection, my name for the collection of stories, my title, was A Dozen Stories when I first put together.

28:46.425 --> 28:48.287
It was Alone at Night with a Dozen Cigarettes.

28:49.195 --> 29:00.231
and when you love to smoke, when you were young enough and healthy enough that you thought you could manage it.

29:00.251 --> 29:07.662
And there is that sort of occasion when you're alone at night and smoking, you have these laptops and cigarettes.

29:07.682 --> 29:17.717
So I wanted to make a kind of sentimental, deliver a sentimental message in a way, a message of a certain sentiment

29:18.659 --> 29:27.530
people who kicked smoking to recall how the hell it used to be when you didn't have to worry so much about it.

29:27.750 --> 29:31.394
How about you this cigarette?

29:31.415 --> 29:34.458
I can't really be around the smoke anymore.

29:35.640 --> 29:40.445
I wasn't that happy to smoke it, but it makes me feel it's up for me to be out of the smoke.

29:40.466 --> 29:41.607
I can't believe it.

29:41.727 --> 29:46.633
I smoked cigars, but good cigars for 20 years.

29:46.653 --> 29:48.295
I'm even walking on the street.

29:48.950 --> 29:54.138
I mean, I get lightheaded.

29:54.158 --> 29:56.140
It's almost transports me.

29:56.161 --> 29:56.962
Is that right?

29:56.982 --> 30:02.510
With the tobacco that's there, I could easily go in and buy myself a $3 and pop away.

30:02.970 --> 30:08.278
Anyway, Laura, what about title?

30:08.999 --> 30:11.463
The title was Change the Children's Hearts.

30:11.903 --> 30:14.087
That's the title we settled on.

30:14.107 --> 30:17.792
I had a mind to return that to a collection because it was never really published.

30:18.127 --> 30:33.405
to return it to a collection of top stories, reclaim my old title, because I had recovered all rights in the list, and some of them are on your desk, and I didn't choose to write it all.

30:33.625 --> 30:36.869
It's mine, and Carthi's is mine as well.

30:37.369 --> 30:41.975
Well, Carthi's is a heck of a project.

30:42.816 --> 30:46.480
You know, I'm always looking at copyright pages and stuff,

30:47.641 --> 30:52.246
I was halfway into that book, and I said, well, this could be said any time.

30:52.266 --> 31:02.878
There are certain things, and clearly I'm in the 50s and the 60s, but he wrote this in the late 50s, I guess, right?

31:02.898 --> 31:03.860
Mm-hmm.

31:03.880 --> 31:07.644
You know, this could really, this book could be any time.

31:10.567 --> 31:16.794
You certainly are most comfortable with writing in the longer form, though.

31:16.814 --> 31:17.395
I mean, you're not.

31:18.235 --> 31:21.419
I'm a novelist, Eric.

31:21.499 --> 31:26.545
I will occasionally do a story, but very rarely.

31:26.565 --> 31:27.526
As a change of pace.

31:28.327 --> 31:35.775
Yeah, I was hit on an idea of something that would be a new story, but I'm very comfortable writing novels.

31:35.795 --> 31:37.497
I like getting into them.

31:37.517 --> 31:42.323
I like having trouble creating an entire world and a lot of creative and knowledge.

31:43.665 --> 31:47.449
And I love identifying myself with the book.

31:47.868 --> 31:54.496
As a writer, stories are difficult.

31:54.516 --> 31:56.879
It's a big world out there for stories.

31:56.899 --> 31:59.962
There are very few places to talk or something.

32:00.023 --> 32:01.044
This is funny because of the P.W.

32:01.064 --> 32:01.805
thing.

32:01.825 --> 32:04.007
What other authors have influenced you?

32:04.027 --> 32:06.410
Are there any others you want to add to that?

32:06.470 --> 32:09.514
But this is cute, too, just because this is a generic thing.

32:09.534 --> 32:13.719
Did he attend the Iowa Writers' Workshop or the Writing Center?

32:13.739 --> 32:17.183
Did he have friends in the literary community?

32:18.040 --> 32:20.143
Because you teach as well as I am.

32:20.383 --> 32:21.485
What is his daily schedule?

32:21.505 --> 32:23.628
What are his work habits?

32:23.648 --> 32:24.509
Do you write every day?

32:24.929 --> 32:26.131
I do write every day, yeah.

32:26.952 --> 32:29.455
And I can see you write in a word processor now?

32:29.515 --> 32:32.760
No, actually, I compose along here.

32:33.921 --> 32:34.122
Still?

32:34.242 --> 32:35.323
At this window?

32:35.403 --> 32:36.625
Yeah, I sit here.

32:36.645 --> 32:39.048
I have a pretty few pounds down there in the water.

32:39.309 --> 32:39.449
Mm-hmm.

32:39.909 --> 32:43.735
And I... That's historic portsmouth out the window, right?

32:43.755 --> 32:45.517
That's historic portsmouth, yeah.

32:45.537 --> 32:47.239
You don't find that it's a distraction.

32:47.259 --> 32:47.760
You write on those

32:48.938 --> 32:55.186
I write on these legal pads and I'm working this morning.

32:55.927 --> 33:00.392
It gets a little bright.

33:03.797 --> 33:06.761
Then I go to the word processor.

33:08.343 --> 33:14.350
I find that I can't really get the words just right on the word processor.

33:14.370 --> 33:16.633
I really like to do it in longhand.

33:19.280 --> 33:26.268
New Hampshire is home for you now, but you've lived kind of a parapatetic life up to coming here.

33:26.808 --> 33:28.130
Yeah, New Hampshire is somewhere early.

33:28.190 --> 33:34.677
I like very much living in Portsmouth, a nice little town, and I love to walk.

33:36.419 --> 33:37.240
Do you work out?

33:37.400 --> 33:39.302
Do you look in good shape?

33:39.322 --> 33:40.884
It has courts right down here.

33:41.004 --> 33:42.846
I know, that's quite a nice thing.

33:42.927 --> 33:43.527
Play tennis.

33:44.048 --> 33:47.852
In fact, Shannon and I,

33:48.592 --> 33:52.016
We've invented what we call winter tennis.

33:52.036 --> 33:54.739
The coldest weather has little tight gloves to put on.

33:55.339 --> 33:55.760
It works.

33:55.780 --> 33:57.221
Well, we're pretty close to the ocean.

33:57.241 --> 34:05.350
We get a pretty good, I'll bet you get a pretty good... The breeze is the worst thing because it will blow the ball over the place.

34:05.370 --> 34:06.191
But we go out.

34:06.211 --> 34:12.077
In fact, a number of other people have followed suit, and they leave the net about pretty much year round.

34:12.358 --> 34:17.383
So, except for snow, play tennis in 33 temperatures.

34:17.903 --> 34:22.388
With little gloves, you can warm up in a hurry, and it works.

34:24.410 --> 34:28.474
But as I'm saying about the walking, I like living where I can walk.

34:28.494 --> 34:34.080
And I walked to the post office this morning to send some books to my kids.

34:34.261 --> 34:36.603
I just got them copies out there.

34:36.623 --> 34:39.767
And I like that I can just walk down to the post office.

34:39.787 --> 34:45.533
I walk to the library, drugstore, grocery store.

34:45.553 --> 34:46.594
I want to get in my car.

34:46.912 --> 34:48.193
I'm sure you're in New England there now.

34:48.494 --> 34:51.357
I'd be coming to England there.

34:51.377 --> 34:52.198
Yeah, New Hampshire.

34:52.218 --> 34:56.923
It's kind of a stoicism up here, though, isn't there?

34:56.943 --> 35:00.046
You don't necessarily see it in the Midwest, I guess.

35:00.066 --> 35:01.408
I think there is, yeah.

35:01.628 --> 35:06.994
Yeah, there is a little Yankee kind of distance.

35:07.154 --> 35:09.276
How long is the drive to Boston from here?

35:09.296 --> 35:12.159
About an hour and 20, an hour and a half?

35:12.660 --> 35:16.564
I can make it in an hour and 10 minutes, hour and five or 10 minutes.

35:16.831 --> 35:20.055
either I know all the moves to make.

35:21.958 --> 35:26.344
But I allow an hour and a half for, you know, I'm going to leave.

35:26.364 --> 35:30.369
My sentence is to run 95 and go over the Mystic River Bridge, though, the Mystic River Bridge.

35:30.389 --> 35:31.170
The Tobin Bridge.

35:31.791 --> 35:33.694
Yeah, that's what I do, yeah.

35:33.714 --> 35:36.998
No, actually, going in, I take, I don't take the bridge going in.

35:37.058 --> 35:40.483
I take, I get on to say 128 and take 93.

35:40.623 --> 35:42.165
Really?

35:42.325 --> 35:43.767
Yeah, Route 1, uh,

35:44.523 --> 35:47.487
Leaving 95 is very slow.

35:47.507 --> 35:52.735
93 is going to take you over by the South East East Westway.

35:53.215 --> 35:56.119
12 miles longer, but it's faster.

35:56.320 --> 36:00.846
Coming home, I take the bridge.

36:00.866 --> 36:04.371
Coming back north.

36:04.471 --> 36:11.361
Did you want to identify Janet?

36:11.601 --> 36:12.943
I know you have

36:13.430 --> 36:21.377
Is this a note of dedication and acknowledgments that you want to mention?

36:21.397 --> 36:25.681
Janet certainly has been a great support.

36:26.202 --> 36:30.326
Janet, do you want to give her a surname?

36:30.366 --> 36:34.269
Janet Schofield.

36:39.394 --> 36:42.357
S-C-H-O-S-I-E-L-D.

36:42.725 --> 36:44.707
one I'm happy to make.

36:44.727 --> 36:47.529
I think he bought the book.

36:47.609 --> 36:48.470
I'm sure he was.

36:48.530 --> 36:50.612
That's what I thought about that.

36:50.632 --> 36:53.715
That's one of the reasons, when we talked about him earlier, one of the reasons.

36:53.735 --> 36:54.456
He hasn't liked my work.

36:55.677 --> 36:58.039
He was a great supporter.

36:58.059 --> 36:59.640
Did you ever meet with him at the Crossroads?

36:59.780 --> 37:00.581
Oh, yes.

37:01.342 --> 37:01.842
Yeah.

37:02.002 --> 37:04.425
I don't see if I can get this in his pieces.

37:04.445 --> 37:07.608
Yeah, a lot of times I'd tell him there.

37:08.028 --> 37:11.571
He was really in a bad church.

37:11.591 --> 37:12.512
Yeah, he...

37:14.213 --> 37:16.155
He's in Darche for years, huh?

37:16.175 --> 37:16.675
That's amazing.

37:16.735 --> 37:20.919
He had the TV when he was younger, too, didn't he?

37:20.939 --> 37:21.419
Yeah.

37:21.659 --> 37:23.901
He had terrible lungs.

37:23.921 --> 37:27.144
He looked like death-worn over 20 years.

37:28.265 --> 37:31.928
And the drinking bouts he used to get with Buddy Everett.

37:32.108 --> 37:38.233
Everett Scheme is this guy's name, you know, looking up a name.

37:38.534 --> 37:42.537
He wrote a biography of Rocky Marciano and a crime worker.

37:42.557 --> 37:43.798
He was looking away the hell up.

37:44.723 --> 37:46.745
Oh, really?

37:47.105 --> 37:51.970
Well, he's a fabulous literary and fabulous writer right now.

37:52.190 --> 37:53.091
He loves the paper.

37:54.232 --> 38:01.899
That's a tough life to be in the late 50s, as he is.

38:02.900 --> 38:10.027
And to be so super qualified as an outdoor writer or this and that, you can't get it.

38:10.047 --> 38:11.188
You can't get everything going.

38:11.308 --> 38:13.110
And I was getting a little gusty.

38:14.052 --> 38:18.577
cranking out books, I think, just a little too fast, and trying to place them for the money.

38:18.597 --> 38:22.821
I mean, and that's never going to work, to get the fast 10K, you know.

38:23.682 --> 38:26.805
It's sad to see it.

38:30.629 --> 38:36.074
So you do, you are teaching, because it's important, for the sake of life.

38:36.174 --> 38:37.876
Is this at Emerson?

38:38.557 --> 38:38.757
Yes.

38:38.797 --> 38:41.680
What's your position there?

38:41.828 --> 38:43.350
I'm a professor.

38:43.370 --> 38:44.531
They may be a professor.

38:44.551 --> 38:45.191
Terrific.

38:45.272 --> 38:46.192
A tenured professor?

38:46.212 --> 38:46.753
I'm tenured.

38:46.893 --> 38:54.561
Yes, I'm tenured and a professor, and I am the... I'm in charge of the graduate program.

38:54.581 --> 38:55.422
Oh, great.

38:55.442 --> 38:55.982
That's great.

38:56.263 --> 39:01.868
So... It is Emerson College of formal languages.

39:01.888 --> 39:02.689
Yeah.

39:02.809 --> 39:03.991
Is it in the back bay?

39:04.011 --> 39:05.372
It's in the back bay.

39:06.173 --> 39:07.774
They give me a parking place.

39:07.794 --> 39:10.597
So I go flying in and park.

39:10.617 --> 39:11.278
That's terrific.

39:11.596 --> 39:13.098
I love the stories of you guys.

39:13.118 --> 39:15.922
I mean, I always cry with quarters at the thing.

39:16.062 --> 39:20.068
If you get parking, if you get a ticket in Boston, it's big money now.

39:20.329 --> 39:21.350
Yeah.

39:21.751 --> 39:24.354
And those meter maids are on you within an instant.

39:24.394 --> 39:26.497
Within an instant.

39:27.859 --> 39:31.484
Have I missed anything in your view of this discussion?

39:32.045 --> 39:38.835
Is there anything that you want to tell me about your work and your writing and your things and everything else?

39:41.144 --> 39:43.887
Does it feel to you that we've covered?

39:45.168 --> 39:45.608
It does.

39:45.808 --> 39:47.010
It feels to me.

39:47.030 --> 39:52.094
Yeah, it feels good, feels right.

39:52.435 --> 39:52.815
Okay.

39:53.236 --> 39:55.738
And just these PWPs are 2,500 words.

39:56.299 --> 40:00.122
I know when I've got more than 4,000 words.

40:00.322 --> 40:04.286
I think we've covered everything.

40:04.306 --> 40:06.969
They really like all this publishing stuff.

40:07.189 --> 40:08.750
Can we just go over?

40:08.871 --> 40:10.392
I can always call you on this, too.

40:11.148 --> 40:13.631
I might just do that.

40:13.711 --> 40:16.153
You know the little blocks they have?

40:16.553 --> 40:18.596
Oh, they show publication history?

40:18.616 --> 40:22.179
Yes, dates and years of publication and publishers.

40:23.180 --> 40:23.621
Okay.

40:23.701 --> 40:25.082
Frank, why don't we just do that?

40:25.182 --> 40:25.963
Sure, okay.

40:25.983 --> 40:29.567
Why don't we just talk, and I'll read them off here.

40:30.588 --> 40:32.009
The Car Thief was published.

40:32.069 --> 40:33.791
Random House, 1972.

40:35.032 --> 40:40.918
Dell Books, 1973.

40:41.152 --> 40:43.716
Contemporary, 1987.

40:43.936 --> 40:45.298
Okay, A German Affair.

40:45.318 --> 40:48.262
A German Affair, Random House, 1976.

40:50.025 --> 40:53.409
Oh, that's that.

40:53.430 --> 40:53.890
True Detective.

40:54.471 --> 40:57.856
True Detective, Summers Books, 1987.

40:59.839 --> 41:00.920
Avon, 1988.

41:03.744 --> 41:09.893
And then Winning the City was Summers Books, 1987.

41:10.413 --> 41:33.282
1990, and Avon 1991, and Children's Hearts of Summit Books, 19... I can check that out.

41:40.838 --> 41:43.060
Don't worry about it.

41:43.120 --> 41:43.901
I can find that.

41:43.921 --> 41:46.183
That'll be the Harvard Institute.

41:46.203 --> 41:46.983
1992.

41:47.003 --> 41:47.384
Okay.

41:47.404 --> 41:48.004
1992.

41:48.024 --> 41:50.887
Do you have a paperback on this guy yet, or is this to me?

41:51.647 --> 41:55.711
I haven't known a word yet on any paperback.

41:55.731 --> 41:59.254
I'm looking forward to seeing what will happen.

41:59.274 --> 42:00.195
Sure.

42:00.215 --> 42:02.857
Do you know what the first frame was?

42:04.338 --> 42:05.119
I think it was 10,000.

42:05.139 --> 42:10.103
That's what was told to me when they were talking about

42:10.420 --> 42:13.964
getting copies in one of those two weeks ago.

42:13.984 --> 42:22.132
So do you have this... I mean, you love to break through and to get that water out of you, I guess.

42:22.172 --> 42:24.855
That's everybody's dream, isn't it?

42:24.875 --> 42:27.097
Yeah, that's pretty much frustrating.

42:27.358 --> 42:29.520
I mean, you're a fine writer.

42:29.540 --> 42:30.941
I mean, you know you're a fine writer.

42:30.981 --> 42:39.330
You know that your other writers think that you're, believe that you're a writer's writer as we used the train earlier.

42:40.745 --> 42:41.826
Is there a formula?

42:41.906 --> 42:45.130
Dick Gates said, if I do it, I do it myself.

42:46.271 --> 42:46.792
Oh, I don't know.

42:46.852 --> 42:53.880
I don't think there is a formula that any of us can easily embrace.

42:53.900 --> 42:56.824
It seems to me you've got to love what you're doing.

42:56.844 --> 43:02.810
And I think those people who have those kinds of commercial success, Stephen King loves what he does.

43:02.830 --> 43:09.418
And I guess John Grisham must, I don't know John Grisham's work, but he must love doing what he does.

43:09.837 --> 43:17.345
And I love doing what I do, not wish it were as successful financially, because I could do more of it.

43:17.445 --> 43:29.018
One thing I know that's very true of my own experience is that I feel that having hit my fifties, that I feel much more in control of my work.

43:29.419 --> 43:38.629
When I first started writing, writing the car piece and trying to write other things, I would know what I was after, but I couldn't make it happen.

43:39.149 --> 43:59.509
I couldn't get into words on the page, and now it seems to me it would be a very difficult thing to get a handle on or to capture in words, but it seems to me that at this time in my life, if I want it, I can get the words very quickly, and I can begin to work with them.

43:59.529 --> 44:05.595
That's kind of reassuring and pleasant.

44:05.744 --> 44:07.526
I don't know how it applies to other writers.

44:07.547 --> 44:11.051
It makes you wonder about all the people who died young.

44:11.652 --> 44:16.199
If that would apply across the board, what one of the things they might have done.

44:16.219 --> 44:26.653
But I know some writers who seem to absolutely get run out of gas by like 40s or mid-40s or something.

44:26.693 --> 44:29.437
They no longer have the desire for the interest.

44:29.677 --> 44:32.261
Myself, I now only feel more desire, more interest.

44:33.422 --> 44:35.245
I have a trilogy planned, actually.

44:35.917 --> 44:56.582
novel that I'm working on now, I have been partway into another novel, and I mean, partway, I have about 50 pages of it, but it's one of three pieces that I've had in mind to turn to next.

44:56.602 --> 44:57.904
I'd love to have a breakthrough.

44:58.805 --> 45:04.472
Let me just, I'd love to stay here, watch the snow fall and take walks and

45:05.465 --> 45:06.346
and do my work.

45:06.867 --> 45:08.510
Are you a morning person?

45:08.530 --> 45:10.893
I'm a morning person, yeah, an early riser.

45:12.556 --> 45:14.879
At what time does it pretty much switch off?

45:16.502 --> 45:33.868
Well, I usually, if I have to go to school, I will be up here riding by maybe 7, 7.30, and I'll be able to work until 9 o'clock, 9.30, and I have to shift, run down, take a shower, get in the car, and I have to get my school stuff together.

45:34.507 --> 45:42.874
And on days when I don't have to go to school, I will start at about the same time, but I'll work until 1 o'clock or something.

45:42.995 --> 45:46.137
Until you're hungry, really.

45:46.278 --> 45:48.259
Do you enjoy the classes at least?

45:49.320 --> 45:53.164
I enjoy graduate classes a lot.

45:53.184 --> 45:57.207
Some I enjoy more than others.

45:57.227 --> 46:02.472
I feel like I became a good teacher over a period of time.

46:03.245 --> 46:13.318
I've been teaching for a long stretch now, but I feel like I've taught enough.

46:18.285 --> 46:27.717
I'm very keen to myself in ways that I, you know, the same questions, the whole crop with new people, and I always question the whole crop, and the same question

46:28.557 --> 46:31.240
Whereas as a writer, you're always exploring the territory.

46:31.260 --> 46:38.489
Yeah, you're always moving off down the road somewhere, and that's really fun to do, and challenging and exciting to do.

46:39.069 --> 46:55.088
Dick Gates was one guy, as I recall now, who believed that if a writer hasn't done it, and I think he's wrong, but he used to challenge us to say, name some great writers in his 60s, who's great as what comes up at a certain age.

46:55.109 --> 46:57.231
I know he was very fearful about losing it.

46:57.920 --> 47:02.146
Maybe it was desire, or maybe it was frustration, or lack of desire.

47:03.668 --> 47:06.933
But I just don't think that's the case at all.

47:07.093 --> 47:15.986
If you have the motivation for it, and you still want to have the stuck, then the best work should be another new one.

47:16.006 --> 47:16.768
I mean, is it?

47:16.788 --> 47:17.368
Yeah, why not?

47:17.388 --> 47:20.493
I mean, we learn it as we go along, I would think.

47:21.394 --> 47:24.619
As long as you know, what I have things to say, I kind of admit,

47:25.004 --> 47:26.926
I guess subject matter has no problem with it.

47:26.946 --> 47:28.528
You said you can block once in your life.

47:28.628 --> 47:29.609
That's about it, right?

47:30.030 --> 47:30.150
Yeah.

47:31.511 --> 47:34.795
I've never thought about that, writers in their 60s and what kind of work they do.

47:34.915 --> 47:37.698
I didn't have to think about that.

47:37.738 --> 47:41.603
There was Yeats talking 20 years ago.

47:41.623 --> 47:43.925
He was in his cuffs at the back.

47:43.945 --> 47:45.527
He was always dealing with it.

47:45.547 --> 47:53.256
I mean, he had such physical burdens to deal with it, the TV, and the foods.

47:53.607 --> 47:59.556
And Enfacema, we continue to smoke through Enfacema.

48:00.017 --> 48:07.107
Anyone among your contemporaries you read for pleasure or for inspiration?

48:07.127 --> 48:13.357
Oh, let's see.

48:13.377 --> 48:15.941
I read Toby Wolfe.

48:16.241 --> 48:19.606
I read Richard Ford.

48:21.349 --> 48:22.230
I read...

48:26.665 --> 48:53.803
um do you exchange manuscripts with anybody or are you pretty much a solitary writer i think i'm pretty much a longer solitary writer alice mcdermott

48:56.753 --> 49:08.748
I really rather like Bastard Out of Carolina by Dorothy Allison.

49:08.788 --> 49:12.173
That was a nice piece of work.

49:16.558 --> 49:19.302
Reminded me of my own novel.
