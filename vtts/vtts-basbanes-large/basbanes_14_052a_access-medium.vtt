WEBVTT

00:02.697 --> 00:06.022
Test, test, test, test, test, test.

00:07.905 --> 00:15.256
I'm talking to Dr. Robert Coles, and you're pointing out some... Is that the Jill Kremitz photo?

00:15.276 --> 00:15.877
Yeah, that's the Jill.

00:15.897 --> 00:17.900
That's in a new book that just came out.

00:17.940 --> 00:19.502
That's right.

00:20.163 --> 00:23.388
I devoured that book, and what a great photograph.

00:24.249 --> 00:25.792
She sent me that, actually.

00:26.092 --> 00:27.574
Is that at Saranac, I think?

00:28.255 --> 00:29.097
No, that's in his home.

00:29.177 --> 00:30.038
That's in his home.

00:31.148 --> 00:31.909
Remarkable.

00:32.049 --> 00:33.390
That's the bed he died in.

00:34.031 --> 00:34.652
Really?

00:34.672 --> 00:34.772
Yeah.

00:36.554 --> 00:36.814
Oh, yeah.

00:37.174 --> 00:40.418
I didn't know that at all.

00:40.438 --> 00:43.941
This is the profile in New York in the two parts.

00:43.961 --> 00:45.403
There he is with me.

00:45.984 --> 00:52.751
He was at LSU, and I was giving these lectures in Plenary O'Connor.

00:52.771 --> 00:58.517
That's Raymond Carver, and this is Dr. Williams, whom I wrote my thesis on.

00:58.837 --> 00:59.738
What's his first name?

00:59.887 --> 01:01.369
William Carlos Williams.

01:01.389 --> 01:03.353
Oh, that's William Carlos Williams.

01:03.393 --> 01:08.041
I'm sorry I didn't recognize the photograph.

01:09.243 --> 01:11.046
You did your thesis on Dr. Williams.

01:11.066 --> 01:11.166
Yeah.

01:12.087 --> 01:12.929
Very interesting.

01:13.850 --> 01:17.797
My whole life follows from that, because that's when I decided on the medical school.

01:18.117 --> 01:19.359
That's Bonhoeffer.

01:20.181 --> 01:23.987
And those are some ordinary working people I worked with in Appalachia.

01:25.452 --> 01:27.655
That almost looks like a Walker Evans photograph.

01:27.675 --> 01:28.917
I know, but it isn't.

01:29.518 --> 01:35.206
Or Dorothea Lange, marvelous.

01:35.847 --> 01:43.338
This is Anna Floyd and Eric Erickson, both of whom I knew and worked with.

01:43.398 --> 01:46.242
Dr. Floyd, marvelous.

01:46.542 --> 01:49.907
And this is finally when she was not sick.

01:52.013 --> 01:54.195
She was a very young woman there.

01:54.215 --> 01:55.036
She was a young woman.

01:55.056 --> 01:56.678
It was before she got lupus.

01:56.698 --> 01:58.540
I mean, she died in the thirties, didn't she?

01:58.560 --> 01:58.880
Thirty-nine.

01:59.061 --> 01:59.221
Yeah.

02:00.882 --> 02:01.643
And this is?

02:01.843 --> 02:02.764
Seymour Valley.

02:04.186 --> 02:07.830
And then also, written about A.G.

02:08.110 --> 02:08.791
Orwell.

02:08.931 --> 02:14.097
That's George Barron, and I was looking at the Diary of the Country Priest, a novel.

02:14.117 --> 02:15.478
I have everything A.G.

02:15.518 --> 02:16.719
did in first edition.

02:16.739 --> 02:17.380
I love A.G.

02:17.680 --> 02:22.687
One of my sons' no name is aging.

02:22.847 --> 02:23.168
Really?

02:24.249 --> 02:25.311
Yeah.

02:25.331 --> 02:28.816
This is Walker Evans with Alex House.

02:28.836 --> 02:36.086
He and I worked together as a photographer.

02:36.146 --> 02:36.246
Wow.

02:36.918 --> 02:37.839
You know who this is?

02:37.900 --> 02:38.300
I don't.

02:38.380 --> 02:39.803
That's Bruce Springsteen.

02:42.347 --> 02:45.512
And you're holding the bottle of Jack Davis Black at the record show.

02:46.533 --> 02:46.774
Yeah, right.

02:47.114 --> 02:48.276
And what occasion is that?

02:48.296 --> 02:52.803
Well, I was after one of his concerts, and he's a Percy fan, you know.

02:53.103 --> 02:53.745
I didn't know that.

02:53.905 --> 02:54.486
Oh, yeah.

02:54.506 --> 02:55.227
That's amazing.

02:55.287 --> 02:56.649
He's a Walker Percy fan.

02:56.689 --> 02:57.851
That's truly amazing.

02:57.951 --> 03:00.916
And Walker wrote him a letter, you know, before he died.

03:00.936 --> 03:01.336
No, really.

03:03.039 --> 03:03.139
Yeah.

03:03.159 --> 03:03.600
Really.

03:04.694 --> 03:09.481
I so wanted to interview Walker Percy, one of the great, great missions of my life.

03:09.541 --> 03:10.643
I was never able to do it.

03:10.683 --> 03:14.890
I wanted to get out of Louisiana even, and it just didn't come to pass.

03:15.290 --> 03:16.232
But I met him once.

03:16.913 --> 03:23.983
By the way, those were pictures of A.G., of four successive, you know, quick.

03:24.003 --> 03:26.467
Pop, pop, pop, pop.

03:26.487 --> 03:28.590
He died a young man, too, actually, didn't he?

03:28.791 --> 03:29.792
Forty-five.

03:29.812 --> 03:29.992
Yeah.

03:31.655 --> 03:32.476
I loved A.G.s.

03:32.496 --> 03:32.997
I love him.

03:34.242 --> 04:03.203
I think this goes to the very heart of what I've been trying to do with my entire life, which is to figure out the nature of the way to figure out how children grow up and what matters to them and how they become adults and what it means to become an adult.

04:03.841 --> 04:09.469
And my first work with children was when I was originally trained in pediatrics.

04:10.610 --> 04:12.613
And I think I go into that in this book.

04:12.794 --> 04:30.338
And I worked with kids who had polio and who had to face limitation of movement, even the possibility of death, because I worked also with children who had leukemia at a time when we did not have a cure for leukemia, as we do now, 80 to 90 percent of children.

04:30.841 --> 04:33.885
who get leukemia will survive.

04:36.028 --> 05:00.021
And it was in the midst of that kind of work actually that my career veered from pediatrics to child psychiatry because I was so moved by the moral testimony of those children under duress, facing life's hazards, if not the loss of their own life,

05:00.406 --> 05:05.491
they became morally reflective in a way that was very surprising to me.

05:05.632 --> 05:13.740
And that gave me a big deal of moral powers myself, prompting me to stop and think about matters that perhaps I otherwise had ignored.

05:14.861 --> 05:21.829
And in a way connected with the kind of undergraduate education I had.

05:21.909 --> 05:24.692
I was a student of Perry Miller's, who was

05:25.718 --> 05:32.368
actually a tutor of mine, and his field was the Puritans in New England.

05:33.550 --> 05:39.458
And he himself was the one who got me connected to William Powers Williams.

05:39.478 --> 05:40.961
He admired his poetry.

05:42.202 --> 05:52.097
And what I began to realize is that the kind of moral reflection that Perry Miller taught me to embrace

05:52.651 --> 05:58.259
the kind of moral reflection that you find in Williams' poetry and prose, for that matter.

05:58.960 --> 06:17.308
I was, in my own way, hearing from these children who were young, and not necessarily from well-educated families, but in a so-called quote-unquote existential situation, were suddenly becoming alive to what life

06:18.470 --> 06:37.488
to life's mysteries and its disappointments, but also we're becoming in a way more thoughtful than I think a lot of us are, who enjoy good health and don't have to face some of the hazards of life as these children are facing them.

06:37.508 --> 06:44.595
This kind of experience is something that I've never forgotten.

06:45.132 --> 07:00.354
It's probably no accident that when I stumbled into Newby Bridges in New Orleans in 1960, which I'm always writing about, this little girl went through labs to get an education, that I heard from her the same kind of moral reflection.

07:00.374 --> 07:06.623
And so, what I'm telling you is that basically I've had a lifelong interest in moral questions.

07:06.683 --> 07:13.553
Going back to my undergraduate days, when I studied with a reading

07:14.309 --> 07:34.225
I studied with a professor whose interest was moral reflection, as it has taken place in New England, in its ministers, in its theologians, in its professional people, in its writers, and its writers especially.

07:35.032 --> 07:45.067
I reconnected in my clinical years, and I continue with this to this day as I work with children from a variety of circumstances.

07:45.848 --> 07:51.056
My ears and my eyes, I think, are quick to respond to these moral questions.

07:51.837 --> 07:59.208
This is probably why I'm so interested in Walker Persia and Franley O'Connor in Dorothy Day.

07:59.228 --> 08:04.195
I worked in her soup kitchen when I was a medical student.

08:05.677 --> 08:08.881
That's true, yes, I recognize that.

08:08.901 --> 08:34.452
And, you know, I've written about, I think the side of me that has been interested in and written about writers such as Simone Weil and Dorothy Day and Walker Percy and Flannery O'Connor and William Krause Williams is the side of me who, as a child psychiatrist, is going to respond to children in this way, concentrating

08:34.718 --> 08:48.633
less on their impulsivity and their emotional tensions that people like me usually concentrate on.

08:48.673 --> 08:54.960
And I'm not saying we shouldn't, namely their struggles with sexuality and with aggression and whatever.

08:55.381 --> 09:02.228
But in my case, I think I'm more interested in their moral struggles, have been for a long time.

09:02.528 --> 09:07.694
and address them in my writing.

09:07.954 --> 09:11.178
The Children of Crisis series was eight volumes, is that right?

09:11.198 --> 09:30.139
There were five volumes of Children of Crisis and three volumes called The Inner Lives of Children, in which I had to deal with their moral and their political and their spiritual affiliations and ways of identifying themselves and their beliefs.

09:30.963 --> 09:36.152
And for those, particularly the first five, you traveled virtually everywhere.

09:36.172 --> 09:37.133
All over the country.

09:37.333 --> 09:41.420
It was really an investigative… Investigative field work.

09:41.620 --> 09:56.565
North and South, East and West, rich and poor, black and white, English-speaking and Spanish-speaking, boys and girls, all the whole range, rural and urban.

09:57.085 --> 10:09.997
And my preparing for this interview, of course I managed to find a number of previous feature pieces that have been written about you.

10:10.017 --> 10:13.380
And you had said, I think, after, this is it, I'm not writing anything for you.

10:13.400 --> 10:14.521
I keep saying that.

10:16.122 --> 10:17.363
I keep saying that.

10:17.623 --> 10:27.092
I was going to say that to you right now, but this is it.

10:27.393 --> 10:32.700
You know, right now I'm reading a lot of Bonhoeffers.

10:33.721 --> 10:34.562
There's a collection.

10:36.344 --> 10:44.675
I'd be surprised if I somehow didn't try to come to terms with this thinking, because what he struggled with is what we all struggle with.

10:44.715 --> 10:48.320
Here was a man of decency who was challenged by Hitler.

10:48.340 --> 10:48.920
What do you do?

10:48.940 --> 10:51.404
Who stands up to evil?

10:53.226 --> 10:54.868
I think very few of us.

10:55.608 --> 11:04.080
are going to be willing to take on evil when it controls the state apparatus, the police, the military.

11:04.922 --> 11:19.623
And there he was from a rich Aryan family, could have had an easy time rationalizing that fifteen-year spell, and instead chose to— I've never read M.D.'

11:19.603 --> 11:20.164
's response.

11:20.184 --> 11:20.564
Yeah.

11:20.965 --> 11:23.288
You ought to read his prison letters.

11:24.290 --> 11:24.450
Okay.

11:24.751 --> 11:28.055
He was killed by Hitler just before Hitler killed himself.

11:28.175 --> 11:28.535
Really?

11:28.936 --> 11:29.156
Yeah.

11:30.237 --> 11:32.119
He had to get rid of Bonhoeffer.

11:32.900 --> 11:33.100
Why?

11:33.140 --> 11:35.963
He kept him in a concentration camp for years.

11:36.464 --> 11:39.467
Well, because he was an anti-Nazi.

11:39.487 --> 11:40.829
Why did he have to kill him at the end?

11:40.849 --> 11:49.438
Because I think this was his way of trying to kill off the good that he was trying to kill off on a larger scale.

11:49.719 --> 11:54.724
At a parallel point, you notice all this resurgence of interest in Walter Benjamin.

11:54.940 --> 11:55.461
Yeah.

11:55.981 --> 11:57.242
Three books have come in.

11:59.064 --> 12:02.248
First one of his writings, there's a new biography of him.

12:02.328 --> 12:06.512
There's one of the three books that have come in.

12:06.532 --> 12:12.479
I know there's a plot walk of Percy, but Benjamin, of course, wrestled, didn't he?

12:12.539 --> 12:14.541
He killed himself trying to escape.

12:14.941 --> 12:15.422
Yeah.

12:15.442 --> 12:17.084
A great bookman as well.

12:17.564 --> 12:18.545
Very much so.

12:18.665 --> 12:24.812
And I think a humane critic.

12:25.197 --> 12:39.919
I think it's a long and abiding interest in my part, constantly trying to fulfill itself through explorations, exploratory conversations with children, with their parents, with their teachers.

12:40.340 --> 12:51.677
And what this book in particular I'm struggling with is not the moral thinking of children,

12:52.096 --> 12:54.939
how their behavior is shaped.

12:54.959 --> 12:57.021
And this is an important distinction.

12:58.623 --> 13:07.312
And this is a distinction that maybe a lot of us who are interested in moral questions are to make for ourselves, even if we're not children.

13:08.193 --> 13:15.721
Namely, do we live up to in our daily lives what we profess in our intellectual lives?

13:16.442 --> 13:19.926
Is there a disparity, in other words, as Emerson pointed out?

13:20.615 --> 13:22.277
is a great danger.

13:22.417 --> 13:25.600
Is there a disparity between intellect and character?

13:25.620 --> 13:32.086
Well, of course, the word character, the whole concept of character, is the central.

13:32.666 --> 13:33.407
Is the central.

13:33.427 --> 13:34.128
What is it?

13:34.668 --> 13:39.373
How do we help build it up, not only for our children, but for ourselves?

13:39.433 --> 13:49.002
And I guess what I'm saying is, if we want our children to have a certain kind of moral quality, if we want to shape a certain kind of character in them,

13:49.319 --> 13:53.904
I think the task is autobiographical, not only parental.

13:54.545 --> 13:57.949
Can you define character for a general leader?

13:57.969 --> 14:01.653
Well, I can define it the way my father defined it once for me.

14:01.693 --> 14:04.817
He said, character is how you behave when no one's looking.

14:07.360 --> 14:18.533
And what he meant is that it's a kind of a rock-bottom way of behavior that you yourself basically either know or ought to know, particularly if you want to

14:18.800 --> 14:20.482
develop it in someone else.

14:21.523 --> 14:29.051
So, in a way, I look upon the question of character as a personal question for parents.

14:29.811 --> 14:46.849
How willing are we as parents or teachers to confront ourselves, never mind our children or our students, with what it is we really believe in, in that way that my father was getting at, in that moment of truth when we really examine how we behave,

14:47.605 --> 15:14.440
Not how we behave in order to impress people, whether it be lawyers or policemen or someone who has something that we want, an admission certificate or we want them to buy something from us or to patronize us, but how we behave in response to our own moral sense of what's right and wrong, if we have such a sense.

15:15.162 --> 15:16.884
What is driving this?

15:17.125 --> 15:20.850
Is there something that you see out there in the world today?

15:20.870 --> 15:23.213
Well, I've seen it in my own soul.

15:23.474 --> 15:31.185
I've seen, you know, I described my relationship with my son one day when I was taking him to the Emerson Hospital here.

15:31.205 --> 15:31.645
And you were speeding.

15:31.666 --> 15:38.335
And I was speeding and, frankly, sprattering people, because it was a very rainy day.

15:38.787 --> 15:41.130
He was driving through slush as well.

15:41.150 --> 15:48.280
But he pointed it out to me, and by the time, he pointed it out in a very nice way, but it was a very pointed way.

15:48.300 --> 15:50.603
I mean, it was a very jarling way.

15:50.623 --> 15:52.085
He got me to scroll down.

15:53.547 --> 16:00.576
And then when we got to the hospital, I was again ready to start pulling rank, and I was intimidated by him.

16:01.720 --> 16:05.566
And I thought to myself, he is teaching me something here.

16:05.606 --> 16:10.814
And I got annoyed with him, I have to admit.

16:10.834 --> 16:13.358
I'm not sure this is so rare.

16:13.378 --> 16:14.139
Yeah.

16:14.159 --> 16:17.704
I have two teenage daughters, and it is amazing.

16:17.744 --> 16:21.370
And this is a theme throughout your work, I think, but things that we can learn from kids.

16:21.630 --> 16:22.091
Right.

16:22.872 --> 16:27.559
People don't appreciate the intelligence and the depth.

16:28.433 --> 16:31.456
And the moral search of children.

16:31.536 --> 16:33.679
I mean, what is Walker Percy about?

16:33.699 --> 16:40.125
He's about, you know, a kind of moral search for how to live a properly reasonable life.

16:41.467 --> 16:47.013
And a connected life, because that's the end of the movie, though.

16:47.053 --> 16:48.775
We hand one another along.

16:48.815 --> 16:50.476
That's a moral statement.

16:51.477 --> 16:52.479
One of the great, great books.

16:52.499 --> 16:54.421
And our children hand us along.

16:54.441 --> 16:57.664
It's not only us handing the children along.

16:58.252 --> 17:09.087
I hope parents and teachers will read it just as I'm a parent and a teacher.

17:10.289 --> 17:17.438
It's really addressed, you know, to myself as well as to my fellow parents and my fellow teachers.

17:18.320 --> 17:19.882
And it's based on my own struggle.

17:19.942 --> 17:25.930
You know, my wife and I brought up three children and struggled with them and tried to

17:26.585 --> 17:29.531
you know, learn from them as well as teach them.

17:29.951 --> 17:33.819
Now, you have three sons, and are they all three physicians?

17:33.899 --> 17:34.761
Is that right?

17:34.921 --> 17:37.686
Two of them are physicians and one's in medical school.

17:37.706 --> 17:37.907
Amazing.

17:38.708 --> 17:40.091
And how did this happen?

17:40.111 --> 17:42.275
I don't know!

17:42.295 --> 17:45.180
But I— You see, but it's the example that you said, isn't it?

17:45.200 --> 17:46.062
Isn't it pleasing?

17:46.379 --> 17:51.765
One of them is a resident in surgery, one of them is a pediatrician, just finished his training.

17:51.805 --> 17:52.606
Here, around here?

17:52.626 --> 18:04.079
Yeah, he just finished in North Carolina, and he's going to, I will tell you, he's going to work in a migrant clinic, a clinic for migrant farm workers in California.

18:04.099 --> 18:09.926
And the oldest one is learning to be a surgeon, and the youngest one is in medical school.

18:09.946 --> 18:14.091
You know, you mentioned a Bronx Tale, a film about a Kristen Tolstoy story.

18:14.324 --> 18:16.326
That's a whole story, a story.

18:16.467 --> 18:20.011
Frankly, I think the book, the whole book is worth it.

18:20.131 --> 18:28.681
Just for parents to read that story and to read it to their children or teachers with a class and then to discuss it.

18:29.022 --> 18:38.293
And tell me about finding that story and how you recognize that it not only resonates with you but with people.

18:38.473 --> 18:42.778
Well, that story goes back to my mother.

18:43.096 --> 18:59.000
There's a book, a book of poems that I wrote, which the poems aren't so good, but my mother loved Tolstoy, and she died with Tolstoy literally in her hands.

18:59.361 --> 19:06.652
She took some of his books with her to the Mass General and was reading them as she was dying of cancer in her 80s.

19:08.174 --> 19:08.855
When was it?

19:08.875 --> 19:10.538
This was 10 years ago.

19:11.345 --> 19:16.470
And I took home from that hospital room her Tolstoy books.

19:17.511 --> 19:18.452
You had them.

19:18.472 --> 19:19.052
I had them.

19:19.373 --> 19:26.580
She taught me to read Tolstoy, going back to my adolescence, War and Peace, Anna Karenina.

19:27.280 --> 19:30.704
But very important, she taught me to read those moral fables.

19:30.804 --> 19:33.166
And that's what she had with her, the fables?

19:33.186 --> 19:34.287
Yeah, she had that.

19:34.307 --> 19:36.089
She had the death of Ivan Ilyich.

19:36.109 --> 19:38.011
She had Master of Man.

19:38.191 --> 19:40.373
How much land does a man need?

19:41.804 --> 19:44.789
So you've got this passion.

19:44.809 --> 19:46.592
It goes from my parents.

19:46.672 --> 19:52.581
If you read The Call of Stories, my parents, I wrote it after they died and dedicated it to them.

19:52.601 --> 19:53.783
That was about ten years ago.

19:53.803 --> 19:55.085
About ten years ago.

19:55.105 --> 19:59.232
If you want to, I'll give you a copy of The Call of Stories and of the poems.

19:59.873 --> 20:00.514
Would you do that?

20:00.775 --> 20:03.339
Yeah, because you'll see there's a Tolstoy poem.

20:03.499 --> 20:06.283
I'll make you this afternoon a copy of A Gentle Madness.

20:07.485 --> 20:09.128
Okay.

20:09.884 --> 20:13.231
Okay, then I'm going to just check my tape, so this is a good opportunity.

20:14.413 --> 20:19.483
The note thing is, the first poem is about my mother and Tolstoy.

20:19.503 --> 20:29.884
So the line goes from, oh dear, M. Williams and all of your mother's Tolstoy.

20:41.963 --> 20:56.264
But you were talking about Tolstoy, and how that story, which your mother passed on to you, and which in fact she was holding, literally, while she was dying in the hospital.

20:56.364 --> 21:05.178
And she not only handed the story over to us, but she kept on telling us that these are stories that you can live your life by.

21:05.398 --> 21:07.481
I remember the phrase, live your life by.

21:07.501 --> 21:10.806
But stories, and I want to get back to that, okay?

21:10.988 --> 21:23.681
And what she was doing is she was making a connection between the reader and the moral implications of a story, but also the moral implications of reading.

21:25.163 --> 21:36.895
Are you going to read in an abstract, distancing way and not connected to your life, or are you going to read in such a way that what you read informs the way you live?

21:37.718 --> 21:51.931
The Call of Stories deals with, in one fashion, it's my way of addressing my fellow writers and my fellow teachers and saying, hey, this is serious stuff.

21:51.951 --> 21:55.234
This isn't just the deconstruction of texts.

21:55.254 --> 21:58.397
This is reading as an aspect of living.

21:59.939 --> 22:05.464
It's amazing how reading has this whole exercise

22:06.018 --> 22:15.853
Just within the last six months or so has really—and my book, for instance, people, when I give a talk, they say, well, this is all about the passion for books, but does reading ever enter it?

22:17.174 --> 22:19.378
You know, that's a very good question, I have to say.

22:19.638 --> 22:20.319
Of course it does.

22:20.359 --> 22:21.200
We love our books.

22:21.561 --> 22:28.371
I can't say I read 50,000 books that I—I don't own 50,000 books, but I own about 15,000 books.

22:28.431 --> 22:35.822
But I don't know if you've been following this whole great debate on reading, turning it around.

22:35.988 --> 22:46.564
You're here talking about the bond between—you're going beyond the author to the reader, but now we're talking about the reader getting stories that you can live by.

22:46.604 --> 22:47.946
That you can live by.

22:48.127 --> 22:48.828
It's amazing.

22:48.868 --> 22:58.823
And to me, you know, reading is an act of companionship, and the literal meaning of companionship, namely with Brad, namely communion.

22:59.073 --> 23:04.880
namely Jesus and his disciples or the Hebrew prophets.

23:05.300 --> 23:08.905
It's Percy talking about handing one another along.

23:08.945 --> 23:12.229
We hand one another along as writers and readers.

23:13.350 --> 23:23.342
And a reader can get from a writer some kind of moral response that the writer may not even be consciously intending.

23:23.913 --> 23:37.609
There may be that moral aspect of the story that comes out of the aesthetic capability of the artist becoming almost a transcendent phenomenon.

23:38.149 --> 23:39.411
But you follow me?

23:39.551 --> 23:40.071
Yes, I do.

23:40.392 --> 23:49.402
And so it's almost gratuitous in the non-pejorative sense of gratuitous.

23:49.442 --> 23:51.945
It's like grace coming out of a story.

23:52.651 --> 23:55.015
that the reader is privy to.

23:56.538 --> 24:13.647
But that tension, when she said to us, my mother, and my father too, live by these stories, she was doing in a sense what Tolstoy asked of himself when he wrote, what is art?

24:14.167 --> 24:25.042
when he went through what we would now call a midlife crisis, tried to, and said to himself, I've constructed these two extraordinary novels called War and Peace and Anna Karenina, and now what?

24:25.062 --> 24:30.369
Now we've got, as Percy and Kierkegaard would say, now I've got my whole life cracked.

24:30.389 --> 24:31.871
What am I going to do with it?

24:32.071 --> 24:32.652
What am I going to do next?

24:32.672 --> 24:35.276
What am I going to do with this life, you know?

24:35.436 --> 24:38.840
And this story specifically was given to you by your mother?

24:38.961 --> 24:40.022
Oh, definitely.

24:41.032 --> 24:53.205
She gave it to me, and the huge irony of it is she gave it to me among a number of moral fables that she had collected.

24:53.365 --> 25:04.577
And then a student of mine, a college student, brought it to me because he was using it as a volunteer with some underprivileged kids in Boston.

25:04.597 --> 25:07.260
And I said, my God, I know this story.

25:07.460 --> 25:08.021
Very well.

25:08.561 --> 25:10.043
What is there about that story?

25:10.580 --> 25:38.798
It's one of many that— But it just seems to have, for you, a particular— It is a reminder that we can take for granted our own privileged life and forget how it goes for others and how it might soon enough go for ourselves, see, as we get a little older and become vulnerable.

25:39.250 --> 25:41.373
And also it took a child to point it out.

25:41.393 --> 25:43.715
Oh, I'll make one for you.

25:44.156 --> 25:44.777
Yeah.

25:44.797 --> 25:48.882
And then of course the kids are, you have the kids discussing, well what's a dishpan?

25:50.223 --> 25:52.166
That's right.

25:52.186 --> 25:53.127
Is this really bad?

25:53.147 --> 25:54.288
Is this really insulting?

25:54.409 --> 25:55.029
I guess.

25:55.049 --> 25:55.550
Right.

25:55.570 --> 25:59.655
And the more they probe it, then you have to say, my God, I'm learning from this kid.

25:59.939 --> 26:02.823
And we're learning the nature of empathy, aren't we?

26:02.843 --> 26:03.584
I think, yeah.

26:03.604 --> 26:05.526
But maybe we're learning it from them as well.

26:05.586 --> 26:12.916
We're learning it from them because, you know, I worked as a pediatrician in a nursery in a children's hospital.

26:15.880 --> 26:19.745
The kids were not yet old enough to speak language.

26:20.426 --> 26:23.690
They were eight months old, nine months old.

26:24.531 --> 26:27.735
They'd hear a child crying and they'd stop crying.

26:28.458 --> 26:30.701
And everyone would say, oh, God, look what's going on.

26:30.721 --> 26:31.682
All the kids are crying.

26:31.743 --> 26:40.655
But what was really going on is little infants hearing tears, responding with their own tears.

26:40.735 --> 26:46.082
This is a kind of an early instinctual empathy that we're capable of.

26:46.102 --> 26:50.849
And I sometimes think a lot of us lose this as we get older, unfortunately.

26:51.269 --> 26:57.057
Do you feel, obviously, it's a symbiotic thing here, I guess.

26:57.198 --> 26:58.279
We help a child.

26:58.597 --> 27:02.681
people are in moral intelligence and we get something back.

27:04.102 --> 27:10.287
Is there some anxiety in your part that maybe people are dropping the ball on this lately or in recent years?

27:10.347 --> 27:26.342
Well, I look around and I see a civilized, quote civilized, unquote, affluent society, powerful, second to none in the world, and yet many moral questions in the country.

27:26.402 --> 27:27.743
How do we treat others?

27:28.600 --> 27:30.603
Why are there so many criminals?

27:31.144 --> 27:32.986
Why are our jails so full?

27:34.328 --> 27:36.211
What do we watch on television?

27:36.251 --> 27:37.492
You were just talking about that.

27:37.713 --> 27:46.385
Why are our movies and our television programs so riddled with violence and exploitativeness of various kinds?

27:46.485 --> 27:48.468
What does this tell us about ourselves?

27:49.209 --> 27:52.093
Is this what we want our children to grow up to be like?

27:55.117 --> 27:57.460
Self-indulgence?

27:57.946 --> 28:14.471
callous, indifferent to others, mean-spirited, exploitative economically, sexually, culturally and socially of other people.

28:16.474 --> 28:20.099
Is it endemic to the times in which we live?

28:20.119 --> 28:22.303
Well, I hope not.

28:22.463 --> 28:27.210
And I think that for all the crudities

28:27.612 --> 28:38.389
and callousness that one sees on television and in the movies and in the newspapers, in the reports that we read of what's going on in the country.

28:38.449 --> 28:47.342
For all of that, there are millions of us, I think, who are trying to be honorable citizens and honorable parents and honorable teachers.

28:47.843 --> 28:51.368
And those aren't news stories.

28:51.609 --> 28:55.054
That's everyday life.

28:55.625 --> 29:05.019
I guess I'm addressing that aspect of ourselves, the search that a lot of us have for meaning for ourselves, for our children, for our students.

29:06.261 --> 29:08.123
You're very gentle in the book, I think.

29:08.384 --> 29:09.566
I mean, you don't scold people.

29:09.686 --> 29:11.528
Is that preachy?

29:11.548 --> 29:12.730
Well, I hope not.

29:12.830 --> 29:21.463
I don't want to start getting into a polemical posture, because in a way, it's not that I'm afraid of taking a stand on various issues.

29:21.815 --> 29:25.058
And I have in other ways.

29:25.318 --> 29:28.441
I've written about a lot of social and cultural issues.

29:28.942 --> 29:37.070
And Lord knows I was in the Civil Rights Movement at a time when it wasn't so popular, you know, in the early sixties in Louisiana and Georgia.

29:37.530 --> 29:50.843
But I think if you start scolding people, then it becomes a huge and rather unfortunate irony.

29:52.105 --> 30:07.443
you're undercutting what I think your effort is, is to understand people and to try to persuade them of something that you think is important.

30:07.503 --> 30:11.748
If you scold them, you won't be able to persuade them.

30:12.689 --> 30:13.711
It's self-defeating.

30:13.831 --> 30:21.640
And in a way, you're doing the very thing that you are morally against, namely

30:23.155 --> 30:29.786
You're in danger of becoming abusive yourself toward other people.

30:30.687 --> 30:38.440
If it seems that I don't question you specifically about the book, I have the book and I've read it, so I am covering other areas, if that's okay with you.

30:38.460 --> 30:39.061
That's fine.

30:39.822 --> 30:40.403
That's fine.

30:40.443 --> 30:46.733
In fact, I'm glad you're doing that because I have stated all of that in the book.

30:47.624 --> 30:48.525
I'm interested.

30:48.706 --> 30:50.328
I'm afraid.

30:50.368 --> 30:54.315
I was afraid that I was becoming preachy in the book.

30:54.335 --> 31:01.306
No, and it's such an opportunity because of what's going on in the world.

31:02.367 --> 31:08.016
And I kept worrying about that, and I'm worried that reviewers and readers will feel that.

31:08.116 --> 31:09.859
No, I don't think so.

31:09.879 --> 31:12.383
But again, I guess they want to see

31:12.700 --> 31:17.926
If there's an agenda here, too, if there's a political—of course, you look at the blurbs, you've got a Bennett blurb, you know.

31:17.966 --> 31:23.152
That book sold two and a half million copies, you know.

31:23.172 --> 31:26.956
Well, I assure you that this won't.

31:26.976 --> 31:27.837
That I know.

31:27.857 --> 31:30.540
But it is interesting that that book sold two and a half million.

31:30.560 --> 31:32.822
Because I think there is a hundred at first.

31:32.842 --> 31:35.185
I think that's what I'm talking about.

31:35.225 --> 31:37.488
That's what he addressed.

31:37.508 --> 31:37.948
That's right.

31:38.536 --> 31:43.163
people will feel that they've had quite enough virtues.

31:43.724 --> 31:45.347
But, you know, here we are.

31:45.848 --> 31:52.458
I'd like to kind of seg you to literacy, too, because we talk about stories, stories we can live by, the importance of stories.

31:53.440 --> 31:57.726
And people wonder about the future of the book.

31:57.766 --> 32:06.400
And we talk about television and kids finding it so easy to be, to tune into these things.

32:07.021 --> 32:08.183
You know, reading is hard.

32:08.423 --> 32:19.117
Toni Morrison on the Oprah Winfrey show, remember, she said, Oprah said, you have such words that we have to go over again and pause.

32:19.658 --> 32:20.379
Did you see that thing?

32:20.399 --> 32:21.380
No, she said.

32:21.400 --> 32:24.585
She said, that's called reading.

32:24.605 --> 32:27.328
That was quite an extraordinary.

32:27.348 --> 32:29.131
It's called reading, she said.

32:29.531 --> 32:32.235
It's not supposed to be all that easy, you know.

32:32.367 --> 32:34.689
I think she said it in such an elegant way, too.

32:34.709 --> 32:38.153
She said, not my dear.

32:38.173 --> 32:40.556
I'm using that quote in my new book, by the way.

32:40.576 --> 32:41.316
It's wonderful.

32:41.577 --> 32:45.521
The irony is, here's Oprah making books.

32:46.242 --> 32:49.745
She takes a book, and if she blesses it, it'll sell a million copies.

32:49.826 --> 32:50.246
I know.

32:51.047 --> 32:54.150
On the one hand, so we don't want to knock somebody who's helping books.

32:54.731 --> 32:58.254
But on the other hand, she'd say, oh, this is hard.

32:58.315 --> 32:59.776
We have to go over the words.

33:00.497 --> 33:01.598
You know, it's reading.

33:03.181 --> 33:10.307
Do you have any anxious moments about kids not reading or reading?

33:11.028 --> 33:14.972
Are you hopeful that maybe the book will survive?

33:14.992 --> 33:16.893
There's no substitute for it.

33:17.033 --> 33:25.241
It is the most important aspect of education that I know, is that children learn how to read, and read well and fluently.

33:25.721 --> 33:32.327
And if we're failing to do that, we are failing ourselves as a nation and as a part of the world.

33:32.628 --> 33:33.769
Are we failing it?

33:33.789 --> 33:36.792
Well, for some children, definitely.

33:37.433 --> 33:39.275
Of course, I'm in a lucky situation.

33:39.355 --> 33:44.220
I see college students who, by definition, almost learn how to read.

33:44.240 --> 33:45.321
But not always.

33:45.341 --> 33:46.402
Maybe at Harvard.

33:46.422 --> 33:47.183
Yeah, I know.

33:48.164 --> 33:49.105
And this is important.

33:49.125 --> 33:51.908
But then, you know, there's something else that's also important.

33:52.288 --> 33:58.575
Those who can read, and read well, but don't take to heart what they read.

33:58.595 --> 34:00.677
Take to heart what they read.

34:01.332 --> 34:11.984
Those who can read and read well and read at an abstract, distanced posture and don't take to heart what they read.

34:12.065 --> 34:14.868
And that is, in a way, even worse.

34:15.589 --> 34:24.519
If it's possible for something to be worse than a non-reader, that would be my nomination.

34:25.440 --> 34:29.685
The person who can read well and doesn't take it to heart and doesn't try to live by it.

34:29.952 --> 34:30.893
What do you see now?

34:30.913 --> 34:35.560
Of course, you work with college students, which is, you've worked in elementary schools.

34:35.620 --> 34:45.414
You've worked, as you pointed out earlier, and as you've documented so wonderfully in your books with kids from every, what do you see?

34:45.995 --> 34:46.496
I see a lot.

34:46.516 --> 34:48.378
There is a passion for books, though, isn't there?

34:48.399 --> 34:57.271
There is, and I'm thinking of the ordinary classrooms all across this country where teachers are struggling every day to teach children how to read.

34:57.291 --> 34:59.875
I've done it myself working in an elementary school.

35:00.226 --> 35:01.948
I'm not alone in this.

35:02.529 --> 35:29.929
Nor should we forget that if there are a number of people who have not learned how to read, most of us do learn how to read, I would like us to teach ourselves and our children, our sons and daughters and our students, not only how to read, but an attitude toward reading.

35:30.719 --> 35:32.160
I'm glad you didn't say what to read.

35:33.242 --> 35:34.643
You could have said that right there.

35:34.843 --> 35:35.384
I couldn't.

35:36.385 --> 35:37.706
Did you think about saying that?

35:37.786 --> 35:38.046
No.

35:38.667 --> 35:47.135
See, you're hitting on a very critical matter that I didn't say that.

35:47.276 --> 35:58.667
I'm not interested in specifying a particular agenda, political or cultural, but I am interested in helping people to take seriously

36:00.318 --> 36:09.110
what they read, and to look for its moral significance and personal significance in their lives.

36:11.233 --> 36:13.116
And let me give you an example.

36:14.418 --> 36:19.906
Let's take the Bible, which is the first book, and so controversial even now in American life.

36:23.931 --> 36:25.293
You can read it literally.

36:25.854 --> 36:28.097
You can get tangled up in

36:28.482 --> 36:30.704
in questions of interpretation.

36:31.284 --> 36:33.386
But there is a larger issue here.

36:33.446 --> 36:41.013
There are the lives of the people in the Bible and what they were struggling with morally and spiritually, the Hebrew prophets, Jesus.

36:42.294 --> 36:58.287
It would be wonderful if people not only took the Bible seriously as an act of faith or as a creedal response, but took it seriously in such a way that it influenced how they behaved with their neighbors.

36:59.009 --> 37:06.560
how they behave with their children, how they behave with someone who's in need on the street standing there.

37:06.981 --> 37:16.856
Think of what Isaiah might have done or Jesus might have done with a blind person, with a prisoner, with a hungry person.

37:18.639 --> 37:21.784
And that's what I mean about a book.

37:22.365 --> 37:27.953
If the book doesn't live in the heart and soul of the person, if it's only something that's argued about,

37:28.405 --> 37:35.136
fought over, absorbed in order to get an A in an examination— And then quickly progressed.

37:35.156 --> 37:40.585
Yeah, and absorbed in order to show the world how smart you are, then this is sad.

37:40.866 --> 37:42.769
It's not doing it.

37:43.210 --> 37:44.272
It's not doing it.

37:45.013 --> 37:49.941
This is the difference between, you know—look,

37:50.377 --> 37:54.304
The two things in the first page here, I quote from Emerson and I quote from St.

37:54.404 --> 37:55.846
Augustine.

37:57.509 --> 37:59.613
I mean what those epigraphs say.

37:59.633 --> 38:01.917
I really do.

38:02.738 --> 38:08.428
And I consider the epigraphs one of the most important pages in the book.

38:09.089 --> 38:16.401
Those two, and the Tolstoy story, and the personal story of my son and me on the way to the hospital.

38:16.803 --> 38:18.044
You know, there it is.

38:18.404 --> 38:31.276
Well, that little boy at the end of the leukemia, who's praying for the doctors, and of course, there was a little bit of skepticism there in your part, that maybe he's really praying to keep them alive.

38:31.316 --> 38:32.778
That's right.

38:33.158 --> 38:35.060
Which is true, I'm sure he was.

38:35.420 --> 38:36.881
But there's something more.

38:37.262 --> 38:41.666
In a sense, this book is stories.

38:42.787 --> 38:45.409
It's stories about how we might

38:46.098 --> 38:58.533
It's a parent's story book and a teacher's story book about taking stories seriously and connecting them to our behavior.

38:58.954 --> 39:04.681
Are you familiar with the book that was published last summer by a woman named Sapphire Push?

39:05.582 --> 39:07.525
It was an African-American woman.

39:08.306 --> 39:10.468
And it was kind of controversial.

39:12.230 --> 39:14.333
I just thought it was angry.

39:14.853 --> 39:44.657
but really they should know about it because to me the triumph of the book is this girl who's been repeatedly raped by her father she's HIV positive from her father she's had two children it's an unspeakably horrible story and yet for me the triumph was this woman works with her and teaches her how to read and it's this emerging joy and it's at a very very rudimentary level it's called push

39:44.975 --> 39:46.417
It was a big seller.

39:47.219 --> 40:04.866
In fact, we mentioned that you don't say what to read, but do you have a sense of this debate that's going on where Shakespeare, for instance, is no longer required reading English courses?

40:04.886 --> 40:07.070
I do, and I find it very sad.

40:07.470 --> 40:10.375
I can't imagine not reading Shakespeare.

40:11.030 --> 40:21.861
Scott Turow told me of, I mentioned, I said, how do you feel about Georgetown, you know, saying you don't have to study Shakespeare, Chaucer, Milton, Dryden to get a degree in English literature.

40:21.881 --> 40:23.422
He said, I'll give you one better than that.

40:23.462 --> 40:38.877
He was at a dinner, he was an alum of Amherst College, and he was at a dinner, and I can use this, and I intend to, where the president was informed they had just graduated a summa quid laud, summa, in English, and this student had never taken the course

40:40.038 --> 41:04.746
I have students at Harvard College in my undergraduate course who haven't read Tolstoy, who haven't read George Eliot, who haven't read Dickens, who haven't read Hardy, who haven't read, you know, never mind, Shakespeare.

41:05.367 --> 41:14.196
Well, what they've read is they've studied history courses or science courses.

41:14.296 --> 41:16.198
They've majored in certain subjects.

41:16.638 --> 41:19.881
But they haven't had that broad general education.

41:19.921 --> 41:21.303
The core education.

41:21.363 --> 41:30.392
Well, the core education unfortunately doesn't address general education, because it is also specific to certain subjects.

41:30.412 --> 41:32.674
It doesn't address that great books.

41:33.835 --> 41:39.741
There's a range that I think is urgently needed for all of us.

41:41.403 --> 41:42.604
And it's very sad.

41:43.105 --> 41:50.733
You can get by at Harvard College without reading some of the most important— Harvard?

41:51.714 --> 41:52.795
I'm astonished.

41:52.815 --> 41:57.160
The great tradition of wisdom in literature.

41:58.962 --> 42:01.085
Do you think it's a political thing?

42:01.145 --> 42:04.730
I mean— Well, if someone can get through Amherst College and not— SUMA.

42:05.171 --> 42:05.531
SUMA.

42:05.731 --> 42:06.993
In English!

42:07.013 --> 42:10.358
Think of what those who don't major in English, and most students don't.

42:10.658 --> 42:13.943
Only ninety percent of Harvard College students don't major in English.

42:13.963 --> 42:14.083
Right.

42:14.383 --> 42:16.286
So they can get by with much more.

42:16.887 --> 42:19.951
Actually, I'm going to find—I'd like to find this student.

42:20.512 --> 42:21.793
I'd like to talk to this student.

42:21.974 --> 42:22.234
That's right.

42:22.494 --> 42:24.377
And say, what are you doing with this degree?

42:24.597 --> 42:26.680
I would also talk to the English department.

42:26.780 --> 42:28.142
I intend to, by the way.

42:28.443 --> 42:30.607
Look, I go out, I do field work.

42:30.667 --> 42:32.370
You'll see when I send you my book.

42:33.492 --> 42:35.836
Go over that of English department.

42:35.856 --> 42:36.937
Well, I'm very interested.

42:37.058 --> 42:39.502
What is English literature?

42:39.522 --> 42:46.734
You give me a degree in literature, call it cultural studies, call it anything you want, but don't call it English literature, and leave out Shakespeare.

42:47.395 --> 42:54.467
You see, one thing that does enter into this whole debate about, and I'm going to ask you about this, about the canon debates and

42:54.734 --> 42:55.896
That's a new word, even.

42:55.916 --> 43:04.007
I mean, in terms of literature, the canon, we've never used that before, up until the last three, have we, up until the last three or four years?

43:04.107 --> 43:07.332
Well, if we have, it hasn't become as significant, you know.

43:07.712 --> 43:09.034
It's now the canon.

43:09.835 --> 43:11.557
Black canon, the Western canon.

43:11.678 --> 43:15.883
And you have, you know, four or five different groups argue it.

43:15.903 --> 43:20.590
I mean, it's fighting, and it's what they teach in schools.

43:21.329 --> 43:25.255
And you see, one thing I hear over and over is, well, literature has to be relevant.

43:26.177 --> 43:29.182
So therefore, the suggestion is that Shakespeare is not relevant.

43:29.202 --> 43:30.384
Oh, this is nonsense.

43:31.145 --> 43:36.574
And you as a psychiatrist know that Shakespeare had Freud beat by 300 years.

43:36.894 --> 43:37.796
As Freud knew.

43:38.817 --> 43:40.520
And so did George Eliot, by the way.

43:40.540 --> 43:48.653
If you read Middlemarch, you've got an elaborate construction of the unconscious and the way it works that preceded Freud by at least a generation.

43:49.207 --> 43:52.250
Everybody thinks it started with Freud.

43:52.270 --> 43:54.892
No, no, no, no, no.

43:55.413 --> 43:56.213
He knew this.

43:56.294 --> 44:00.017
He even knew it about Ibsen, who was a contemporary of his.

44:03.020 --> 44:08.645
He wrote about Ibsen, and he was enormously admiring of Ibsen's psychological wisdom.

44:09.486 --> 44:18.454
So, you know, what Freud did is took that and systematized it, the wisdom that's available in plays and in novels and in poems.

44:19.312 --> 44:27.369
Do you feel, personally, that fiction has to be relevant?

44:27.389 --> 44:28.631
And there were quotes around that.

44:28.772 --> 44:30.515
I think it is relevant.

44:30.535 --> 44:31.698
It doesn't have to be.

44:31.718 --> 44:32.880
It is.

44:33.221 --> 44:37.590
Because fiction is storytelling about the human condition.

44:37.840 --> 44:52.515
And in that sense, if it's good fiction, it's always relevant, because it always connects with—we are the creature, as Walker Percy told us, of language, who tells stories to make sense of this life.

44:53.777 --> 44:59.082
And in that sense, it has to be and is relevant.

44:59.843 --> 45:04.708
How is it that fiction, which, you know, in the traditional

45:05.448 --> 45:08.312
It is true.

45:08.833 --> 45:11.357
Fiction is true.

45:11.737 --> 45:16.344
When you talk about fiction, are you also including important nonfiction as well?

45:16.685 --> 45:18.147
What is it about fiction?

45:18.167 --> 45:21.292
Fiction is story intelligence.

45:21.392 --> 45:22.313
I know what you're saying.

45:23.815 --> 45:30.205
This disparity between fiction and nonfiction is a false disparity.

45:30.385 --> 45:32.028
They're not antagonists.

45:32.408 --> 45:33.570
They're not polarities.

45:33.610 --> 45:34.932
They're different modes.

45:35.300 --> 45:45.613
of trying to understand the world through addressing the world's particular questions directly or indirectly through storytelling.

45:45.830 --> 45:55.721
By the way, I gave these lectures at the New York Public Library last year, and there's a book coming out that addresses this fact-fiction issue.

45:55.741 --> 45:57.283
It was published in it.

45:57.303 --> 46:01.747
Oxford University Press in April, and it's called Doing Documentary Work.

46:02.048 --> 46:02.648
Okay.

46:02.668 --> 46:07.494
But it has a whole section on fact and fiction.

46:07.514 --> 46:10.437
And I'll make sure that you get a copy.

46:11.412 --> 46:13.194
I'm very friendly with the people at Oxford, too.

46:13.214 --> 46:14.556
Yeah, Oxford University Press.

46:15.638 --> 46:22.046
They were the three—you know that series where there was public library lectures and then they made books out of them?

46:22.326 --> 46:23.047
That's right.

46:23.067 --> 46:28.594
And this deals with this whole issue, which meant a lot to me, to try to figure that out.

46:29.315 --> 46:31.378
I just interviewed Paul LeClaire for my new book.

46:31.544 --> 46:35.711
He's wonderful, Gregorian.

46:36.071 --> 46:38.335
Yeah, he was on the book C-Span last night.

46:38.435 --> 46:43.183
Yes, and if we only had more college presidents like him, it would be a different country.

46:43.203 --> 46:44.966
You talk about an inspired person.

46:45.026 --> 46:48.251
He's an inspired person and inspiring.

46:48.271 --> 46:50.915
Yeah, I can't wait to see him.

46:50.935 --> 46:52.999
Anyway, I'm sorry, we were talking about fiction, nonfiction.

46:53.019 --> 46:54.862
What was the title of the book before I forget?

46:55.002 --> 46:57.045
Doing Documentary Work.

46:58.088 --> 47:01.993
Yeah, ask them to send you a copy.

47:02.093 --> 47:02.573
Oh, they will.

47:02.593 --> 47:07.379
I'm doing an interview with one of their authors, Brian Fagan, on exploration and stuff.

47:07.399 --> 47:16.009
Because that's, if I have to say something to myself, in a way this is me coming to terms with my own work in a more, you know, direct way.

47:16.390 --> 47:21.936
And coming to terms with storytelling as an aspect of nonfiction.

47:22.338 --> 47:23.920
you see, as well as fiction.

47:24.201 --> 47:25.242
I write non-fiction.

47:25.402 --> 47:27.305
Yeah, same here.

47:27.325 --> 47:29.809
I would love to be a novelist.

47:30.349 --> 47:42.246
Well, you can be a novelist addressing, you know, the real world, which means you tell the story that you see versus the story that you make up.

47:42.527 --> 47:44.029
But it gets more complicated than that.

47:44.069 --> 47:47.494
When you make up a story, you're drawing on the world.

47:47.674 --> 47:51.720
I mean, Walker's wife used to tell me, she'd say, Walker will go to the supermarket.

47:51.937 --> 47:56.102
And he'll come home and he starts taking notes.

47:56.863 --> 47:58.284
And I said, what are you doing?

47:58.304 --> 48:05.352
And he said, well, he heard this and he saw that, and that works its way into his fiction.

48:05.372 --> 48:11.199
Can we talk about, now you teach Hopper and Carver, I guess.

48:11.219 --> 48:12.060
Can you tell me a little bit?

48:12.080 --> 48:13.661
How do you know that?

48:13.701 --> 48:15.443
I've been doing my research.

48:15.844 --> 48:18.687
I teach a course called American Life.

48:18.852 --> 48:32.689
It's a seminar, and I show, we read the fiction and the poetry of Raymond Carver, and there are moments in some of those stories that literally describe some of Hopper's pictures.

48:34.171 --> 48:40.239
But again, where is the insight, the perception, I guess, is a word?

48:40.259 --> 48:46.767
For me, just because I've always loved Hopper, and I've always loved Carver,

48:47.253 --> 48:52.868
And one day, reading Carver, I began to think of some Hopper pictures.

48:53.630 --> 48:56.417
And then I thought more of that, and then I thought, my Lord.

48:57.299 --> 49:02.713
But I'm sure that Carver never thought that he was— Well, I know Tuscall of that.

49:02.896 --> 49:08.083
And she told me, this is interesting, that he did know of Harper's paintings.

49:09.384 --> 49:16.433
I don't think he knew about them in the way I'm teaching it, but she said that it's very interesting what she told me.

49:16.533 --> 49:32.093
She said that the last story he wrote about Chekhov's death, called Errand, that he had seen a Harper picture of, which I think you would know if you saw it, of a movie theater, and there is a

49:32.410 --> 49:39.597
The old people who used to put you to your seat, you know, that you'd walk in and show you to your seat, they don't have that anymore.

49:40.338 --> 50:01.860
And there was this woman standing with her flashlight from the old days of the movies, and he got the idea from that picture that this would be the way he'd write this story from the point of view of Chekhov's death, from the point of view of a busboy in the hotel, just as

50:02.178 --> 50:12.216
You know, Hopper is saying, these people are watching the movie, but here is someone who's working who helps them to get to their seats so they can watch the movie.

50:12.356 --> 50:13.758
Follow the analogy.

50:14.479 --> 50:21.672
He got an idea for a point of view of a story from looking at a Hopper picture.

50:22.242 --> 50:24.465
But I didn't know this when I came up with this.

50:24.485 --> 50:26.809
So it just seems to validate everything that you perceive.

50:26.829 --> 50:27.550
Well, I guess so.

50:27.610 --> 50:36.523
I mean, I wrote her a letter telling her about what I was teaching, and she wrote me back, and she said, well, you know, as a matter of fact, Ray... So you were right on with that.

50:36.664 --> 50:37.325
I guess.

50:38.627 --> 50:45.978
But even if that hadn't happened, I, as the teacher, see a certain convergence, and I offer it to my students.

50:45.998 --> 50:49.583
But it's a perfect example of how we draw all the time from...

50:50.002 --> 50:55.708
storytelling, be it visual storytelling in the form of a painting or a story.

50:56.528 --> 50:58.350
Now I have something else to ask you.

50:58.370 --> 51:00.893
Do you know about the magazine Double Take?

51:01.834 --> 51:02.454
I've heard of it.

51:02.474 --> 51:03.015
I don't know.

51:03.035 --> 51:05.277
Because, you know, I edit that with Alan Harris.

51:05.297 --> 51:05.737
Oh, really?

51:05.898 --> 51:06.258
Yeah.

51:06.618 --> 51:07.319
I'm the editor.

51:07.539 --> 51:08.100
Is that right?

51:08.340 --> 51:09.161
Yeah.

51:09.181 --> 51:09.821
I didn't know that.

51:09.841 --> 51:16.348
And you should see Double Take because that's about storytelling, both visual and… Is that right?

51:16.388 --> 51:16.648
Yeah.

51:17.569 --> 51:19.671
I get out of North Carolina now.

51:19.988 --> 51:24.557
I'm leaving next week for a couple of months.

51:24.577 --> 51:25.979
Chapel Hill, is that where you mentioned Chapel Hill?

51:25.999 --> 51:27.722
Yeah, that's why I mentioned Chapel Hill.

51:29.486 --> 51:30.027
Double take.

51:30.227 --> 51:32.932
Aren't they publishing some books now, too, aren't they?

51:33.293 --> 51:33.373
Yes.
