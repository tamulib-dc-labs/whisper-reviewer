00:02.950 --> 00:13.643
Is this an exorcism of some sort, this book, would you say?

00:14.524 --> 00:16.506
Is it cathartic in some ways?

00:16.527 --> 00:17.508
Yes, I suppose it is.

00:17.528 --> 00:18.990
It is.

00:19.470 --> 00:26.579
It was, uh... First of all, I think I wanted to go back and examine my life in the face of what had happened.

00:28.501 --> 00:29.262
And, um...

00:30.355 --> 00:36.424
Try to work out why it had happened, which is very hard to do.

00:36.464 --> 00:40.489
Try to work out what my part of it was.

00:40.890 --> 00:45.737
It, of course, being... Well, you're talking about just the end of my book.

00:45.777 --> 00:48.140
I've written a autobiography of my entire life.

00:48.661 --> 00:50.764
That's what I'm saying.

00:50.784 --> 00:51.104
You said it.

00:51.124 --> 00:54.009
You're referring to your entire life, I guess.

00:54.029 --> 00:54.569
That's what I'm asking.

00:54.589 --> 00:55.411
Yeah, I'm so sorry.

00:55.451 --> 00:57.494
Yes, yes.

00:57.514 --> 00:59.356
I was not referring to the book.

00:59.376 --> 00:59.957
No, I know.

01:00.190 --> 01:00.590
I know.

01:01.251 --> 01:07.638
And it was cathartic in that the end of my last marriage was very dreadful.

01:08.719 --> 01:17.710
And I think it has been helpful to me to try to write it down and try to make sense of it insofar as anyone can of such a true calamity as it was for me.

01:19.071 --> 01:25.538
Your earlier book was certainly, I guess, a creative autobiography.

01:25.558 --> 01:25.939
It was.

01:26.279 --> 01:29.843
It was subtitled The Education of an Actress, and that's what it was really about.

01:30.194 --> 01:33.518
I had no intention of revealing anything that I didn't want to reveal.

01:33.739 --> 01:38.024
So maybe you can compare the two?

01:38.104 --> 01:42.430
The first book was, my brother says, Bloom Tells Nothing, and the second is Bloom Tells More.

01:44.553 --> 01:49.879
And when you say tell all, what kind of parameters did you establish for yourself?

01:50.761 --> 01:51.241
I didn't.

01:51.301 --> 01:56.488
I just decided, if I was going to do it, that I must be as honest as I possibly could about everything

01:56.958 --> 02:00.423
that has happened to me in my life, otherwise it wouldn't be a true book.

02:01.464 --> 02:11.519
Does it surprise you that most of the interest in the book certainly does focus on the latter pages?

02:11.539 --> 02:16.827
No, it doesn't, because I think those are the strongest pages in the book and the most dramatic.

02:16.847 --> 02:22.054
But it does surprise me the way it's been distorted in that

02:22.439 --> 02:27.306
I have tried to paint a picture of a marriage that in many ways was very wonderful.

02:28.587 --> 02:42.306
And the man I married and loved all those years was one person with whom I had a fruitful, affectionate, most extraordinary relationship.

02:42.486 --> 02:49.276
And there was, you know, another part of him that was deeply destructive in the end.

02:50.317 --> 02:50.978
Do you...

02:53.050 --> 02:58.656
Of course, I've read the book, you know, so I don't mean to question you on things that I've already read.

02:58.676 --> 02:59.637
Well, you have to.

02:59.657 --> 03:00.598
I don't want to be retreaded.

03:04.002 --> 03:11.350
You say that you're, of course, you say very early that all the factors have altered, which you say very early in the book.

03:12.271 --> 03:15.814
Now, this book, when did you actually decide to write this?

03:17.156 --> 03:21.100
I, during the last couple of months,

03:22.058 --> 03:40.670
of my marriage, I wrote down, I wrote, I kept a diary or journal of the confrontations, I don't know what else to call them, with Philip, between Philip and myself, and in the doctor's presence at the Silver Hill Hospital.

03:41.812 --> 03:46.260
So I had the diary, and I knew it was a very strong document.

03:46.696 --> 03:50.320
I had the letters from Burton, which I knew were very unusual.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.482
Nobody knew about my relationship with him.

03:52.642 --> 03:53.783
Yes, they're wonderful letters.

03:55.205 --> 03:59.910
Great credit to you for maintaining your silence.

03:59.970 --> 04:01.491
Silence all these years.

04:01.511 --> 04:02.933
I just felt it was nobody's business.

04:02.993 --> 04:07.097
But at this point of my life, I thought, well, I have known these remarkable men.

04:07.157 --> 04:10.420
And Burton, I knew when he was truly a wonderful young man.

04:10.460 --> 04:14.965
It's time to, if I'm going to do it, to write it.

04:15.586 --> 04:19.390
And I think also it's, maybe we can accuse you of name-dropping here.

04:19.410 --> 04:25.136
Everyone who went to the narrative has an art to play.

04:25.156 --> 04:28.800
I mean, this is some of you that you know.

04:28.820 --> 04:36.168
You talked about Olivier and Chaplin and, you know, these people did play very important arts in my life.

04:36.188 --> 04:42.775
And I wanted, particularly I wanted to write about Chaplin because it had been such a momentous and

04:43.008 --> 04:56.582
you know, remarkable experience for a young actress of 19 to be chosen by him to be his leading lady and to have remained his friend and Una's friend until the end of their lives.

04:57.824 --> 05:11.378
So I knew I had a lot of interesting material in my early childhood, my childhood in the war, etc., my relationship with my mother, mothers and daughters, then followed by mine with my daughter.

05:11.729 --> 05:16.376
There were a lot of parts that I wanted to try to bring together.

05:16.416 --> 05:21.685
There is a theme, I think, that I noted, of insecurity.

05:21.705 --> 05:24.970
Do you acknowledge that, that there is a theme of insecurity?

05:24.990 --> 05:25.150
Oh, yes.

05:25.170 --> 05:27.554
Not only acknowledge it, but I say it very clearly.

05:28.055 --> 05:30.178
And it runs throughout your life, I guess.

05:30.659 --> 05:30.739
Yes.

05:30.759 --> 05:33.023
Mind you, it runs throughout the life of most actors.

05:33.163 --> 05:35.146
It's a very insecure profession to be in.

05:35.186 --> 05:38.391
And I had a very insecure childhood.

05:38.792 --> 05:39.373
I think...

05:39.758 --> 05:44.584
Again, that's something many actresses seem to share, is the missing father.

05:44.944 --> 05:55.878
It's very strange when you read biographies of actresses how many have a father like mine who was, you know, never quite there.

05:56.939 --> 06:04.288
Do you think that this insecurity was a factor in your attraction to Philip?

06:05.430 --> 06:07.112
Oh, no, I was looking for security.

06:07.152 --> 06:07.993
I was looking...

06:08.395 --> 06:34.420
for a strong and stable uh person and in many ways he's that and in many ways he's exactly the diametric opposite of that and of course you were warned repeatedly by mutual friends that uh well only by gore and that was as more as much a joke as anything else no no i wasn't i mean no first of all uh everyone acknowledges his brilliance and his

06:36.425 --> 06:40.130
His seriousness.

06:40.270 --> 06:57.792
And truly, apart from his really rather dreadful relationship with my daughter, though that's something he may see very differently to me, we had a wonderful relationship.

06:58.893 --> 07:02.037
Otherwise it wouldn't be a tragic end.

07:02.818 --> 07:03.799
Do you think you've had enough

07:04.724 --> 07:08.829
Do you think that there was enough distance from it before undertaking the book?

07:08.849 --> 07:09.330
Yes, I do.

07:09.350 --> 07:14.737
I do, because the book took nearly just under three years, really, to write.

07:15.598 --> 07:20.784
And though perhaps I began it in a very emotional way, I did actually chronologically write it.

07:20.864 --> 07:24.990
That is, from my birth to my wherever I am now.

07:25.030 --> 07:29.736
My next question, did you write for a second about the concluding part for it?

07:29.756 --> 07:31.398
No, though, as I say, I had the diary.

07:31.418 --> 07:33.921
I already had that.

07:34.424 --> 07:36.906
No, I didn't.

07:36.926 --> 07:40.249
And that didn't give you, I guess, a degree of distance?

07:40.950 --> 07:41.210
Yes.

07:41.451 --> 07:42.672
I mean, you know, distance.

07:42.752 --> 07:51.220
I'll never be distanced from it in that sense, because it will remain to hurt me for the rest of my life.

07:51.720 --> 07:53.402
That's no question.

07:53.422 --> 07:58.727
But I distanced enough to be able to look at it and try to work out how it could have happened as it did.

07:59.007 --> 07:59.548
Yes.

08:00.609 --> 08:04.212
You say it early on, and then you also quote Richard Burton,

08:04.917 --> 08:10.365
I guess in both cases that it's been a life, a trip worth taking.

08:10.605 --> 08:13.950
In his case particularly, he said it wouldn't have changed today.

08:13.970 --> 08:14.571
How about yourself?

08:14.831 --> 08:18.436
Absolutely a trip worth taking, yes.

08:18.456 --> 08:20.920
And the very same byways?

08:21.200 --> 08:22.001
Who can say?

08:22.542 --> 08:23.163
Who can say?

08:23.223 --> 08:29.953
But, I mean, my relationship with Richard was very passionate and wonderful.

08:31.174 --> 08:32.376
My career has been...

08:33.200 --> 08:35.022
really more than I could have expected.

08:37.545 --> 09:01.131
My marriage to Rod was companionable and very affectionate, and from that marriage I have the most wonderful daughter, the unmentionable, the unmentionable, and my marriage to Philip, or my years with Philip, because we lived together for 15 years and then were married for three, so whatever one wants to call it, relationship or so, gave me

09:01.482 --> 09:04.086
An immense amount, taught me an immense amount.

09:04.527 --> 09:12.080
And it was truly the first and by far the most central relationship I've ever had with a man.

09:13.683 --> 09:16.187
You discussed the power of books and reading.

09:16.227 --> 09:22.798
I've just written my own book and my own books and I'm looking at another one now.

09:23.048 --> 09:26.533
The first one is called The Gentle Madness of Bibliomania.

09:26.734 --> 09:27.615
Yeah.

09:27.635 --> 09:28.496
It was published last year.

09:28.516 --> 09:28.837
Yes.

09:29.237 --> 09:34.866
I actually read about it because I think I have bibliomania to a high degree.

09:34.986 --> 09:45.502
So whenever I see mentions to this passion for books and how it's shaped your life, and then also you discuss, you know, the reading habits in your relationship.

09:45.522 --> 09:52.212
And incidentally, the new book I'm working on, I had a long interview with Harold Bloom, Connecticut, who has

09:52.647 --> 09:58.176
for just what every book that Philip has written is a canon of great levels.

09:58.296 --> 10:05.948
In fact, is that a characterization?

10:05.988 --> 10:14.402
You described the way he almost attacks the text and reads it at an intellectual level that's almost beyond those people that

10:15.074 --> 10:17.497
I'm just interested in that.

10:17.517 --> 10:18.739
I don't actually say that.

10:18.819 --> 10:20.441
I don't say that, but I guess you say he does read differently.

10:20.461 --> 10:21.623
I mean, he's a scrupulous reader.

10:21.703 --> 10:22.303
Yes, I did.

10:22.323 --> 10:23.725
I said he read differently.

10:23.805 --> 10:29.733
I mean, I read for entertainment, or I read to be moved, or I read for information, but he read for life.

10:30.514 --> 10:31.035
He did.

10:31.055 --> 10:31.355
Yes.

10:31.716 --> 10:34.660
But was that a common point?

10:34.680 --> 10:45.013
Oh, it was tremendously attractive, I think, to both of us, that we both loved the same kinds of books and that reading was central to both our lives, yes.

10:45.955 --> 10:49.379
Jumping ahead here.

10:49.719 --> 10:59.771
You mentioned earlier, I guess, here, how do you judge Philip Roth's writing, if you don't mind?

10:59.931 --> 11:01.613
I think he's the most wonderful writer.

11:01.813 --> 11:04.236
I mean, after Bellow, by far the best writer in America.

11:04.436 --> 11:06.558
After he would place Bellow?

11:06.578 --> 11:08.320
Well, he would place Bellow, too.

11:08.340 --> 11:08.961
Is that right?

11:08.981 --> 11:09.281
Yes.

11:11.864 --> 11:12.705
Interesting.

11:12.820 --> 11:17.485
And I think also Harold would say the same thing.

11:17.866 --> 11:35.105
Did you, of course everybody is, when you read some of these, and you sort of have the distortions in that, in some of the pieces, but certainly that whole sequence you read around in that book where you appear as a character, and then you're actually being given a manuscript to read.

11:35.445 --> 11:38.929
Was it his custom to get you his words in progress, surreal?

11:39.331 --> 11:44.918
Yes, at different points, whenever he was ready to.

11:46.420 --> 11:47.681
And this time he didn't.

11:48.042 --> 11:49.043
And this time he didn't?

11:49.343 --> 11:50.124
No.

11:50.224 --> 11:55.531
Have you figured that out in your mind, what that was all about there?

11:55.731 --> 11:57.173
No.

11:57.193 --> 12:01.018
That's got to be the grapes, and they were a lie.

12:02.339 --> 12:05.303
I mean, clearly it seems it was intended to wound.

12:06.685 --> 12:08.427
I don't think it was.

12:08.947 --> 12:13.536
I don't think he realized how much it would wound, but on the other hand, he obviously knew I wouldn't be pleased.

12:14.498 --> 12:17.825
This is why he didn't show it to me.

12:18.787 --> 12:20.029
Yes, yes.

12:20.831 --> 12:23.937
And it was, of course, totally untrue, but it's a novel.

12:23.957 --> 12:24.799
To make matters worse.

12:25.039 --> 12:28.266
Well, it's a novel, but, yes, to make matters worse.

12:28.346 --> 12:30.330
But anyway, that, you know, there it is.

12:30.749 --> 12:32.631
These things happen with writers.

12:34.112 --> 12:34.332
Great.

12:34.392 --> 12:35.493
That's a great book.

12:35.614 --> 12:36.134
It is.

12:36.154 --> 12:45.343
I'm always looking for my lead in these stories, and I'm always looking for what we call the kicker, you know, the final.

12:45.803 --> 12:49.386
You know, at page 15, you say, I'm a survivor.

12:50.768 --> 12:52.249
Here I am.

12:52.269 --> 12:54.811
By the skin of my teeth this time, I must truly say.

12:54.851 --> 12:58.815
You'd say that this was the greatest...

12:59.302 --> 13:00.364
Oh, yes.

13:00.504 --> 13:02.147
This was the worst thing that ever happened to me.

13:03.309 --> 13:03.630
Yes.

13:05.113 --> 13:06.736
And I'm still here.

13:07.838 --> 13:10.382
And tell me a little about your plans.

13:10.402 --> 13:17.395
It's kind of... Of course, you're an actor who's played some great roles of...

13:17.695 --> 13:19.819
It's funny, I expected you to be taller, isn't it?

13:19.839 --> 13:21.441
Everybody does, yes.

13:21.461 --> 13:23.244
Is that just the way they treat you in a film?

13:23.385 --> 13:29.455
No, I think, you know, you see somebody on stage and they're out of proportion to their importance.

13:32.440 --> 13:36.286
You know, everybody does, is that right?

13:36.526 --> 13:39.872
Anyway, I am not.

13:40.038 --> 13:41.339
You asked me something before that.

13:41.459 --> 13:44.863
About your career, what kinds of plans do you have for your career?

13:44.883 --> 13:45.724
What plans do I have?

13:45.904 --> 13:50.068
I've just, I've really been working three years without stopping for one minute.

13:50.528 --> 14:02.320
Between the book, I've done Long Day's Journey, Cherry Orchard, film with Stallone, I've just finished a television in England, and I've done lots of stuff with orchestras and one-man shows.

14:02.881 --> 14:09.167
Yes, but I'm now going to, for the next three months anyway, just calm down a bit, because I am very tired.

14:09.502 --> 14:09.982
Indeed.

14:10.003 --> 14:16.669
You don't seem to be suffering the fate that so many women actors seem to suffer.

14:16.689 --> 14:20.593
I'm not sitting waiting for the phone to ring for some idiot to ask me to do something, no.

14:21.114 --> 14:22.035
And make it myself.

14:22.715 --> 14:27.941
But it does seem to be a sad commentary on so many marvelous performers.

14:27.961 --> 14:31.504
But as they reach a certain age... Well, it's always been the case.

14:31.585 --> 14:38.952
After all, in a way, theater is a lot to do with sex and beauty and youth.

14:39.708 --> 14:41.130
You know, it always has been.

14:41.170 --> 14:47.197
And when that starts to fade, the parts start to fade.

14:47.217 --> 14:48.658
But there are interesting parts.

14:49.159 --> 14:52.923
Shakespeare seemed to respect the minds of his book.

14:52.943 --> 14:56.628
I don't say he doesn't respect the minds, but, I mean, he didn't write very good parts for older women.

14:57.569 --> 14:58.270
That's for sure.

14:58.290 --> 14:58.490
None.

14:58.510 --> 15:00.272
I'm trying to think.

15:00.292 --> 15:03.696
Well, it's Queen Margaret or, you know, the nurse.

15:04.117 --> 15:04.517
No.

15:05.122 --> 15:09.606
That was partly, of course, that the young boys couldn't play older women.

15:10.907 --> 15:12.789
So, I mean, there was another reason for that, I think.

15:12.809 --> 15:16.252
He had, let's see, Henry VIII, he had... Yes, there's Catherine.

15:16.292 --> 15:16.813
That's wonderful.

15:16.833 --> 15:19.035
I've played... That's a wonderful play.

15:19.055 --> 15:20.396
Yes, that is a wonderful play.

15:20.456 --> 15:21.637
It's a pageantist.

15:21.657 --> 15:25.941
Yeah, but it's a wonderful play, much more than that, though.

15:25.961 --> 15:27.543
It really is.

15:27.563 --> 15:29.465
It has all this pageantry there.

15:29.485 --> 15:30.286
Yes.

15:31.026 --> 15:32.968
But the scenes between Woolsey and...

15:33.151 --> 15:36.357
Henry and between Catherine and Henry are really superb.

15:36.397 --> 15:39.903
He came out of retirement, I think, to write that.

15:39.943 --> 15:40.844
We don't really know.

15:40.864 --> 15:42.407
A lot of people say he didn't write it.

15:43.829 --> 15:46.915
I think he collaborated probably with Shakespeare's Apache.

15:46.935 --> 15:48.798
Well, there are some wonderful scenes in it.

15:48.818 --> 15:51.683
I mean, when we did it, we kept saying, this has to be Shakespeare.

15:51.848 --> 15:53.129
Nobody else could have written this.

15:53.650 --> 15:59.256
If that end is pretty ghastly, with the archbishop and that long, long speech, I'd prefer to think somebody else wrote it.

15:59.496 --> 16:01.218
Well, you look at Titus as well.

16:01.238 --> 16:03.721
Yes, well, that's pretty ghastly, too.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.543
Yes, that's true.

16:05.563 --> 16:07.285
I'd love to find out he didn't write that.

16:07.305 --> 16:16.956
Yes, so would I. Maybe you could talk a little bit on the profession of black hair.

16:16.976 --> 16:20.860
Maybe we could get away from the raw questions for a while and how important it is.

16:21.177 --> 16:29.088
Well, it was important, but, I mean, it doesn't exist anymore, because nobody has it.

16:30.711 --> 16:35.137
And I, I mean, I got it by default.

16:35.157 --> 16:40.565
In fact, I got it probably the best way in the way that actors have done through the ages, which is by doing it.

16:41.626 --> 16:43.489
And I did go to

16:43.840 --> 16:46.543
acting schools for two years, one year each.

16:46.643 --> 16:48.786
Couldn't stand them, frankly.

16:48.806 --> 16:51.729
And I, you know, understudied and walked on.

16:51.789 --> 16:58.758
And then I have to say I was catapulted very, very young into the stratosphere and floated around there.

16:59.739 --> 17:13.375
But I, you know, when I was in my early teens, my mother and my brother and I used to go to the Old Vic every Saturday night, sit in the gallery or the upper circle and we saw Olivier and Richardson.

17:13.912 --> 17:16.215
We saw Gielgud at the Haymarket.

17:16.235 --> 17:19.378
We saw all the great actors, and we saw them again and again.

17:19.398 --> 17:25.645
And that's how I, Edith Evans, you know, that's how I... No, I was lucky.

17:25.845 --> 17:26.526
I was lucky.

17:27.287 --> 17:27.808
I really was.

17:27.988 --> 17:34.876
I've never been to a Shakespeare performance in England, but a chance to rectify that.

17:34.896 --> 17:37.278
Is Shakespeare still very popular in England?

17:37.859 --> 17:38.300
Yes.

17:38.320 --> 17:43.125
I mean, the RSC are always doing productions, sometimes not that good,

17:43.561 --> 17:48.789
one's some occasionally good, if the National does some Shakespeare.

17:48.829 --> 17:51.793
And it's, yes, it is being done.

17:51.813 --> 18:01.788
And the best company, really, I think, is the company called Tique by Jowl, which approaches plays in a very novel and interesting... Contemporary?

18:01.808 --> 18:02.609
Mm, very.

18:03.290 --> 18:04.292
I still like something.

18:04.312 --> 18:11.863
I did an interview with John Uptack, a couple of groups, and he said he had heard some plays, and people fear that a generation from now,

18:13.025 --> 18:17.832
Shakespeare may not be performed because the audience would be unable to understand the language.

18:18.152 --> 18:23.680
Do you, I mean, and I... Well, it's never been easy to understand, but if you tune in after about ten minutes, there you are.

18:23.700 --> 18:29.688
Yeah, I say you have to, it's like reading a libretto of an opera before, you should read the text before you go to the play.

18:29.708 --> 18:31.190
You should, actually, yes.

18:31.251 --> 18:40.163
And I know I do, and I read all the plays, and if it's something I haven't read in 15 or 20 years, it behooves you to re-quite yourself with the language and the... Yes.

18:40.362 --> 18:43.786
Nobody's going to be saying behooves in 20 years, though.

18:43.806 --> 18:45.307
That's an easy one or something.

18:45.327 --> 18:49.372
The trouble is that the vocabulary just gets smaller and smaller and smaller.

18:50.253 --> 18:53.957
And I just did a master class, I won't say where, for some students.

18:57.581 --> 19:00.264
It's hard to believe the level of ignorance, actually.

19:00.564 --> 19:01.225
Really?

19:01.245 --> 19:03.047
Digging your interest in what, just in general?

19:03.627 --> 19:07.932
Yeah.

19:08.032 --> 19:09.694
I'm sorry, yeah.

19:09.944 --> 19:12.787
I'm going to have a major chapter in this new book I'm writing.

19:12.867 --> 19:23.419
On the cannon wars, and the dumping down, and the lamentable fact that people aren't reading important books.

19:24.380 --> 19:32.529
Well, and yet you go into Barnes & Noble, for instance, on this Sunday, and it's full of people milling around and looking at books, and it's almost like an entertainment.

19:33.330 --> 19:34.571
Well, it is an entertainment.

19:34.631 --> 19:35.192
It is an entertainment.

19:35.510 --> 19:37.032
I think it's wonderful.

19:37.212 --> 19:40.736
That's nice, but look at the books that they're buying, you know, and they're looking at it.

19:40.756 --> 19:42.578
Yeah, well, generally, yes.

19:42.999 --> 19:47.564
Was there apprehension on your part of what the reaction to this might be?

19:47.584 --> 20:02.462
Yes, because I know I have exposed myself to, well, when you were truly as honest as I was, you have exposed yourself to any kind of criticism.

20:04.400 --> 20:05.621
Yes.

20:06.162 --> 20:09.665
What's the criticism you feared most?

20:10.105 --> 20:20.315
Oh, that the really stupid women, and one or two of them have, would use the word masochistic, which is idiotic, because I'm far from that.

20:20.696 --> 20:23.358
And the relationship with Philip was far from that.

20:24.479 --> 20:33.748
It was an inevitable, I suppose, conclusion, which I didn't see, to a relationship.

20:34.420 --> 20:43.549
It was a very... I was, in a way, afraid of his force, his intellectual force, but so many, many people.

20:43.569 --> 20:56.222
But it was a wonderfully fine relationship with the fine part of him, and a very unfine relationship with the other side of him.

20:57.203 --> 21:03.870
I think for me, as a parent, in the end, it was unforgivable for some of his behavior, too.

21:04.829 --> 21:05.370
Your daughter.

21:06.491 --> 21:12.861
It was not unforgivable, but un-understandable, but inexplicable.

21:12.901 --> 21:24.057
But as I say, Philip may well have, you know, if he wanted to say, he probably would have many reasons for resenting our relationship, my daughter's and mine, which was very close.

21:24.558 --> 21:26.401
And I think perhaps he felt excluded him.

21:26.441 --> 21:27.563
We never meant to.

21:29.365 --> 21:34.633
But stepdaughter, stepfather, step parents, stepchildren relationship was very difficult.

21:34.765 --> 22:00.739
I think one thing that we haven't seen in the notices of your book is how clearly I'm connected I think it is to the way that the relationship developed and ended is the depression that he was having, his own profound emotional problems, which I think you make

22:01.090 --> 22:02.792
very, very clear here.

22:02.812 --> 22:06.797
And I don't think that they've really gotten into that aspect of it at all.

22:07.138 --> 22:08.740
I think it's hard for people to understand.

22:08.760 --> 22:30.388
I've had one or two, more than one, I've had three remarkable letters from women who say that they have been in relationships that were loving, where they loved and were loved, and their husbands became whatever one wants to say Philip was, some kind of a depressed state.

22:30.875 --> 22:36.540
let us say, and turned against them completely and totally as he did me.

22:37.902 --> 22:40.864
And they're still trying to figure out what happened.

22:40.944 --> 22:44.107
One of them is a psychoanalyst, but they're wonderful letters.

22:44.748 --> 22:49.653
And they say that their husband said almost verbatim what mine said to me.

22:51.154 --> 22:59.582
So it's, you know, I choose to think that far from being an evil person, Philip was at that time a very ill person.

22:59.832 --> 23:01.053
And I hope now he's well.

23:01.574 --> 23:02.175
He may well be.

23:02.255 --> 23:03.076
I don't even know.

23:03.356 --> 23:08.221
So that there's been no... You don't even know whether or not he's read the book.

23:08.241 --> 23:09.323
I would assume he's not.

23:11.025 --> 23:12.006
That he would not.

23:12.767 --> 23:14.148
But I know nothing.

23:14.188 --> 23:16.230
He's been very dignified and very quiet.

23:16.250 --> 23:25.421
And there's been no response from mutual... No, I... I don't ask.

23:25.961 --> 23:27.443
A, and B...

23:28.098 --> 23:29.920
A lot of people he hasn't seen for a while.

23:29.960 --> 23:32.043
He's become slightly reclusive, I think.

23:35.187 --> 23:36.869
No, not a peep is the answer.

23:38.772 --> 23:39.313
Interesting.

23:39.873 --> 23:44.720
Of course, he could have made a fuss about your use of some of his letters, I suppose.

23:44.780 --> 23:45.421
I don't use them.

23:46.322 --> 23:47.023
That's right.

23:47.043 --> 23:50.387
No, I'm well within the legal requirements of that.

23:50.447 --> 23:52.410
As long as you don't quote them directly, I guess.

23:52.430 --> 23:52.710
Yes.

23:52.730 --> 23:54.072
No, I wasn't allowed to.

23:54.389 --> 23:56.712
Which is a pity, because some of them were wonderful.

23:57.893 --> 23:59.675
You weren't allowed to by your lawyers?

23:59.955 --> 24:03.319
My lawyers.

24:03.339 --> 24:04.760
Okay, I know I went through that.

24:04.780 --> 24:06.082
Yeah, well, we all know about that.

24:06.282 --> 24:09.726
They sometimes drive you crazy with it.

24:09.746 --> 24:10.727
Well, they were correct.

24:10.787 --> 24:12.208
I mean, I did everything they said.

24:13.009 --> 24:13.690
I was careful.

24:13.990 --> 24:20.397
I didn't want to hurt him anyway.

24:21.524 --> 24:26.753
It's a pity, as I say, because some of his letters were very wonderful.

24:27.535 --> 24:30.400
Would you like at some point to be able to publish them?

24:30.420 --> 24:31.662
Or do you think this is the final word?

24:31.682 --> 24:32.404
No, it's not.

24:32.904 --> 24:33.766
No, I wouldn't publish them.

24:33.946 --> 24:36.932
They're very personal.

24:36.952 --> 24:38.294
Oh, and that's the final word, yes.

24:39.116 --> 24:40.538
And this is the final word.

24:40.678 --> 24:41.780
Yes, it is, yes.

24:41.800 --> 24:44.325
While you were working on the book, did you ever think...

24:45.267 --> 24:46.548
I mean, did you waver out?

24:46.568 --> 24:48.290
Did the pendulum swing back and forth?

24:48.490 --> 24:49.431
Like, I'm not going to do it.

24:49.632 --> 24:50.312
I've got to do it.

24:50.673 --> 24:51.493
I'm not going to do it.

24:52.454 --> 24:53.676
You mean write the book?

24:53.696 --> 24:54.857
Yeah, the book.

24:54.877 --> 24:55.057
At all?

24:55.197 --> 24:55.357
Yeah.

24:57.500 --> 25:02.705
Or delve into these particularly personal things.

25:02.725 --> 25:03.946
It's no point in writing a book.

25:04.026 --> 25:04.207
Yeah.

25:05.148 --> 25:06.008
No, I knew I had to.

25:06.028 --> 25:07.090
I thought it was very hard.

25:09.592 --> 25:09.732
Uh-huh.

25:09.752 --> 25:10.373
And very painful.

25:11.054 --> 25:12.355
And then, of course, at the...

25:13.972 --> 25:21.083
At the very end, all of a sudden, you discover the other woman, a mutual friend.

25:21.223 --> 25:21.303
Yes.

25:21.323 --> 25:22.605
It wasn't even at the end of the book.

25:22.625 --> 25:24.468
It was quite some time after.

25:24.588 --> 25:26.611
I understand, but you mentioned it.

25:26.631 --> 25:29.275
Yes, yes, I did, yes.

25:29.295 --> 25:33.983
You talk about the ultimate wound.

25:34.203 --> 25:36.607
It happens to be somebody that you vote for currently.

25:36.747 --> 25:37.608
Had known for many years.

25:37.829 --> 25:39.351
We're very fond of.

25:39.371 --> 25:42.055
And one wonders if that was meant to wound.

25:43.553 --> 25:45.595
I don't think so, I think.

25:45.776 --> 25:46.877
I've gotten it.

25:47.538 --> 25:49.500
You know, that's mysterious to me.

25:49.660 --> 25:49.840
Yeah.

25:51.382 --> 25:57.229
It's almost like Portnoy to the end in his, uh... No, I, no, we don't want to say that.

25:57.249 --> 25:57.429
No, okay.

25:57.449 --> 25:58.210
It's not so.

25:59.191 --> 26:01.914
Uh, you know, he, I think, was probably very much in love with her.

26:01.994 --> 26:02.815
I have no idea.

26:03.456 --> 26:07.600
You know, that's outside my realm of, I don't know.

26:07.621 --> 26:09.423
But Portnoy, I know, not at all.

26:09.883 --> 26:10.183
I know.

26:10.784 --> 26:12.426
But I hate that.

26:12.446 --> 26:13.307
Okay, and then...

26:13.490 --> 26:16.614
Yeah, excise.

26:16.675 --> 26:20.260
It's excise.

26:20.520 --> 26:21.682
I love that scene, by the way.

26:21.742 --> 26:30.454
I really love that scene where we are visiting with Elizabeth Taylor and Richard, and she brings her home.

26:31.075 --> 26:32.277
You could almost stage that.

26:32.457 --> 26:33.599
Yes, you could.

26:33.699 --> 26:38.586
She's screaming through the thing.

26:38.920 --> 26:40.021
That's wonderful.

26:40.201 --> 26:41.303
Yeah, it was very funny.

26:41.643 --> 26:46.948
And it's done with good taste.

26:46.968 --> 26:49.311
Well, I hope it was done with a bit of humor.

26:49.351 --> 26:55.157
Well, it's probably, you know, one of the true moments of comic relief, I think.

26:55.537 --> 26:57.600
Yes, I must say there are not many.

26:57.840 --> 27:04.607
And you treated the relationship with all these people, I think.

27:05.414 --> 27:06.075
I hope.

27:06.615 --> 27:09.418
I mean, I think there's a bit of comic relief in Brenner.

27:11.641 --> 27:20.971
Page 223, I've written down here, who is the real Philip Ross, I guess.

27:20.991 --> 27:29.060
You don't...it's almost... Well, I think, like all of us, there are many, in his case, perhaps more sharply divided.

27:29.100 --> 27:32.704
After all, he does write about that a great deal.

27:33.038 --> 27:36.722
Especially in Operation Shylock, there were two Philip Roths.

27:38.084 --> 27:45.993
And, as I say, like all of us, we're all very divided, but I think in his case perhaps a little more so.

27:46.093 --> 27:52.721
And that may be the overriding theme of his body's work.

27:52.861 --> 27:56.565
Yes, because there's often the doppelganger of like Alvin Pepler,

27:56.900 --> 28:02.366
You know, there are doppelgangers in most of us, I mean in the Zuckman books, you know.

28:02.686 --> 28:06.510
That's what I was going to say, one after the other as well.

28:06.530 --> 28:10.294
Yes, so he uses that very brilliantly.

28:10.314 --> 28:13.697
But in real life, perhaps it doesn't work out quite as well.

28:14.138 --> 28:18.763
You mentioned how he, did he suffer through bad reviews?

28:18.863 --> 28:21.085
I mean, you mentioned that a

28:21.622 --> 28:23.785
a certain review by John Updike.

28:23.805 --> 28:27.469
Oh, that had the power to hurt, yes, because he admires Updike, so.

28:29.071 --> 28:33.416
And, you know, we all suffer through bad rules, and everyone says they're not going to take notice.

28:33.476 --> 28:36.059
But, of course, everyone does.

28:36.139 --> 28:38.001
It's impossible not to.

28:38.021 --> 28:38.842
They're very wounding.

28:39.363 --> 28:44.809
My book had wonderful reviews, but I got, you know, a nasty comment.

28:44.829 --> 28:45.830
You only remember that.

28:46.531 --> 28:47.332
That's all you remember.

28:47.993 --> 28:51.137
I have a full-page review in the New York Times.

28:51.377 --> 28:51.477
Yes.

28:51.878 --> 28:56.086
compulsory reading for anyone interested in books.

28:56.306 --> 28:59.332
But then a little sentence down here that says, overblown.

29:00.133 --> 29:03.098
Laughing, because it's always, that's what you remember.

29:03.118 --> 29:07.286
Overblown, imperfect, and something, one other thing.

29:07.667 --> 29:09.871
Yes, yes, yes, that's what you remember.

29:09.891 --> 29:12.756
And to this day, I said, overblown?

29:13.360 --> 29:17.405
He's telling me things I should have done.

29:18.306 --> 29:20.989
Yes, no, I know any two of them.

29:21.009 --> 29:33.985
You know, I think it would be an interesting comment, where your whole life, really, has been geared towards performance and the immediate response from an audience, just writing a book.

29:34.741 --> 29:36.503
You know, you labor for three years.

29:36.523 --> 29:37.785
Yes, yes, it's very different.

29:37.985 --> 29:40.869
Not having a clue as to what the performance is.

29:40.929 --> 29:46.716
And then, of course, even then, when it goes out into the world, the reaction starts to trickle in.

29:47.617 --> 29:49.059
And you get terrible surprises.

29:49.159 --> 30:04.157
I mean, there was one review where there were quotations from the book, but completely out of sequence, put in completely different parts of my life.

30:04.913 --> 30:12.425
to build up this portrait that this creature wanted to present of me that was utterly false.

30:13.166 --> 30:14.548
And there's nothing you can do about it.

30:14.568 --> 30:19.796
You just think, well, as Philip always said, you know, you wrap, in three days you wrap a fish in it.

30:24.784 --> 30:27.048
It's true.

30:27.729 --> 30:29.892
But in terms of...

30:30.057 --> 30:40.829
Neil Simon, a couple of weeks ago, in his memoir, he said that, as a playwright, you know the first night if you've got a hit on your hands.

30:41.530 --> 30:42.571
Oh, I'm sure, yes.

30:42.651 --> 30:46.416
And I'm sure that, as an actor, you probably feel the same thing.

30:46.456 --> 30:47.877
Yes, immediately.

30:47.937 --> 30:48.498
Immediately.

30:48.538 --> 30:51.702
And he said, you know, when you're writing a movie, he doesn't have a clue.

30:51.722 --> 30:53.804
Well, there's 22 million people.

30:53.824 --> 30:54.765
For television, it's

30:55.235 --> 30:57.679
And he has no idea who he's writing for.

30:57.980 --> 30:59.122
He's writing a play.

30:59.142 --> 31:05.895
I'm writing for a thousand intelligent people in New York City and a tough audience.

31:05.915 --> 31:09.902
He has that audience in his head.

31:09.922 --> 31:14.290
And he said, you know, the first night, you never know what the critics are going to say.

31:14.911 --> 31:17.174
And do you find that as an actor?

31:18.276 --> 31:19.478
Well, that you know immediately?

31:19.498 --> 31:19.658
Yeah.

31:20.099 --> 31:20.579
Oh, yes.

31:20.599 --> 31:21.481
That it's great.

31:21.541 --> 31:22.642
Oh, you feel success.

31:22.662 --> 31:23.283
You smell it.

31:23.564 --> 31:24.245
You really do.

31:24.465 --> 31:28.130
And that must be, as a writer, it's an entirely different thing.

31:28.271 --> 31:29.312
Yes, of course it is.

31:29.352 --> 31:31.936
Of course it is.

31:34.019 --> 31:35.001
I am an actress.

31:35.101 --> 31:35.942
I've written a book.

31:36.282 --> 31:38.125
I wish I could write others, but I doubt it.

31:39.227 --> 31:40.108
So...

31:40.949 --> 31:46.974
I think I would actually be quite happy not to act anymore if I could do something else.

31:47.395 --> 31:47.735
Really?

31:47.995 --> 31:48.836
Totally, yes.

31:49.236 --> 31:52.940
But there's nothing that I can do on that level.

31:54.441 --> 31:57.684
So you have no plans for any more books then?

31:57.704 --> 31:59.745
No, I haven't.

31:59.765 --> 32:01.987
So this was the book then that you had to write?

32:02.007 --> 32:03.168
It was a book I had to write.

32:05.050 --> 32:05.390
I did.

32:06.251 --> 32:10.635
And are there any areas in retrospect that you wish you had included?

32:11.324 --> 32:12.426
No, maybe one or two.

32:12.446 --> 32:15.711
I wish I'd exclude it.

32:15.731 --> 32:18.957
I needn't have been quite so honest and let myself in for so much.

32:19.257 --> 32:27.971
I remember earlier Kazan told me a few years ago, he said, you know, when you write about yourself, he said, you expose yourself naked to the world.

32:27.991 --> 32:29.073
Terrifying, yes.

32:30.155 --> 32:32.238
And that's the only way to do it, by the way.

32:32.259 --> 32:35.003
Well, that's the only way to do it, and that's why, you know...

32:35.523 --> 32:38.406
When you say, why did I write the last part, or did I question it?

32:38.426 --> 32:41.710
No, I didn't question it, because I knew if I was going to write the book, I had to write the last part.

32:43.492 --> 32:48.198
And then just tell me how you chose the title.

32:48.218 --> 32:48.739
I chose the title.

32:48.799 --> 32:54.866
I had a lot of very highfalutin titles, mostly from the four quartets, which had been mined.

32:55.347 --> 32:59.672
And literally it came to me.

32:59.892 --> 33:02.055
I thought, of course, it's Leaving a Doll's House.

33:02.095 --> 33:03.336
Simple as that.

33:03.805 --> 33:23.757
and obviously refers to the play and to the part that I played around the world, really, but is also the sign of really a woman's regeneration and gaining independence at any age, really, that closing of the door.

33:24.618 --> 33:27.703
And have you, of course the book is,

33:28.240 --> 33:33.068
just out, so maybe it's too early to receive a lot of mail from these, but have you?

33:33.088 --> 33:36.393
Well, I have had these remarkable letters from these women, yes.

33:37.515 --> 33:46.669
And I hope to have them all, because I really very much hoped that I would reach out to women who have been through something similar to what I've been through.

33:46.749 --> 33:51.597
And do you think that that is the intended reader for the book?

33:51.617 --> 33:52.358
No, I think it's

33:52.675 --> 34:21.552
not I mean I would like it to be of interest to the general public and I think it is and people do very nicely say they can't put it down you know and it's a page turner and that's very nice and wonderful but I would like yes I would like to think that there are many many women as we know of my age or around my age who are either widowed or divorced for younger women they were younger women and they're alone and they have to remake their lives I think it might give them a little bit

34:21.903 --> 34:49.210
more courage to know that whatever my position might seem to be i've had to do exactly the same thing i'm trying to do it you know nowhere in the book do you say you feel used i think it's an important thing this is not no i think that's important to point out this is not a whining complaining oh no it wasn't used by him in any way some people might

34:49.915 --> 34:53.902
feel that, I think, from the fragmentary press accounts.

34:54.362 --> 34:56.606
Oh, well, but they've been really... No, not from reading the book.

34:56.626 --> 34:57.628
No, no, not from reading the book.

34:58.009 --> 35:13.915
The press accounts have been, some have been very kind, and some have been very intelligent, and some have been unutterably false and stupid, and especially the ones that headline, you know, about Claire's complaint, or

35:14.401 --> 35:15.763
Isn't that right?

35:15.863 --> 35:16.624
You know, yes.

35:17.005 --> 35:18.667
Oh, a lot of that kind of stuff.

35:18.687 --> 35:19.949
A marriage to Portnoy.

35:19.969 --> 35:22.072
I mean, absolute crap, frankly.

35:22.573 --> 35:23.975
And a marriage made in hell.

35:24.015 --> 35:25.477
And it wasn't that at all.

35:25.557 --> 35:31.807
And anyone has to only read the book to see that I say what a wonderful, what wonderful years we had together.

35:31.847 --> 35:36.113
So I have resented that terribly, yes.

35:36.133 --> 35:42.923
And even very recently he has expressed some

35:43.493 --> 35:46.878
desire for a rapprochement, but... No.

35:47.939 --> 35:49.962
I mean, you mentioned that at the end.

35:50.182 --> 35:52.526
Well, this is nearly two years ago.

35:53.026 --> 35:53.868
That's 1994, yeah.

35:53.888 --> 35:56.592
Yes, yes.

35:56.612 --> 36:06.265
But that's definitely, that was not in the equation, obviously, at all at that point, and for yourself.

36:06.285 --> 36:11.813
I, for a long time, certainly for a year after I split,

36:13.025 --> 36:16.770
It was possible for me, but it was obviously not something he wanted.

36:18.031 --> 36:24.619
Because I had to take the attitude that what he had said to me was said through illness.

36:25.740 --> 36:30.907
And I thought that there would be a morning when he would wake up and say, oh my God, what have I done?

36:30.947 --> 36:35.452
I've lost a very precious relationship, but that never happened.

36:37.615 --> 36:41.279
Okay.

36:41.299 --> 36:42.120
I think that...

36:43.585 --> 36:45.192
How are we doing?

36:45.754 --> 36:49.128
With pleasure.

36:50.393 --> 36:51.216
With pleasure.
