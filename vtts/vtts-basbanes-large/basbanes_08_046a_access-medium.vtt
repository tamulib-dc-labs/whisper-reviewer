WEBVTT

00:03.338 --> 00:09.866
You told me how to pronounce your name the last time.

00:09.986 --> 00:12.349
It's Mukherjee, right?

00:12.429 --> 00:12.750
Mukherjee.

00:13.371 --> 00:15.934
Bharti Mukherjee.

00:15.954 --> 00:16.354
Excellent.

00:16.394 --> 00:18.838
That is with whom we are speaking.

00:21.020 --> 00:29.791
I read one interview with you, not mine, but you actually have the title for this book, it seems to me, even while you were writing it.

00:29.891 --> 00:32.755
Is that an interview you did?

00:33.157 --> 00:46.156
and you were asking what you were working on, and you said, I'm working on a book that I'm calling Leave It to Me, and I don't want to say much about it, but it is interesting to me that you had the title so early in the process.

00:46.176 --> 00:55.009
Yeah, and I have the title for my next novel, which I haven't started a word on, but I know I've done already a year's research on.

00:55.670 --> 01:01.999
Yeah, the title came to me, and I realized what the voice...

01:02.823 --> 01:29.978
of the, the character came to me first, and, yeah, uh, Davey, Debbie, and then, um, as she was working through her adventures, I had the title, and I knew then the, what the tone, and what the voice, this girl's voice, was, uh, uh, going to be about.

01:30.177 --> 01:33.180
Someone who's, leave it to me, is not a jazzman.

01:34.782 --> 01:39.347
You don't even care for jazz that much, your first time listening to it.

01:40.308 --> 01:42.611
You said also that you really have to become these characters.

01:42.671 --> 01:44.453
Is that particularly important?

01:45.474 --> 01:48.517
Especially in this book.

01:49.238 --> 01:53.923
You know, you're going to think I'm crazy if I say that

01:54.140 --> 02:04.549
This is as much an autobiographical novel as... I never would have asked that question.

02:05.990 --> 02:09.253
...as The Holder of the World or Jasmine were.

02:10.314 --> 02:15.319
Because it's all like virtual experience.

02:15.839 --> 02:17.521
You notice the look of incredulity.

02:17.541 --> 02:21.324
It's not picking it up.

02:21.524 --> 02:22.645
But I...

02:23.992 --> 02:52.125
these are all alternate selves and that I become that character more and more draft by draft and the novel has changed draft by draft so dramatically as I have found out more and more about who she is and assumed her body I feel by

02:52.730 --> 02:55.592
Seven, five, eight, five, nine.

02:55.773 --> 03:01.798
Yes, and very different stride, very different voice.

03:01.818 --> 03:10.765
And if you hear me read, it's really like I take on for the moment the voice of the character.

03:10.785 --> 03:11.546
I can't help it.

03:11.686 --> 03:15.109
It's not something that I work at.

03:15.189 --> 03:19.633
And you actually feel when you're reading that you are this character.

03:19.653 --> 03:22.635
Yes, otherwise I couldn't think like her.

03:22.953 --> 03:29.941
or feel like her, and therefore do all the naughtiness cause the... Right.

03:30.321 --> 03:36.729
Cause all the mayhem that she does as an avenging goddess.

03:37.970 --> 03:40.633
And she is an avenging goddess.

03:40.653 --> 03:40.894
Yeah.

03:40.914 --> 03:51.846
And I've come to think now of my particular kind of fiction as really virtual truth or virtual...

03:52.130 --> 04:14.948
experience if i'm not experiencing it i'm not sure that i can write it you're using the word virtual here now this is kind of a because of the virtual reality it's a confession too when we talked the last time we get off into a tangent about that because you're a star trek talking about the holodeck and things we might do but it was very interesting

04:15.181 --> 04:26.538
But I find it interesting now that you're talking about a virtual... By virtual, I'm only because of the holder of the world and my obsession with such techy things.

04:28.001 --> 04:32.608
I'm using virtual reality as virtual experience.

04:33.749 --> 04:35.372
So where did this character come from then?

04:35.392 --> 04:36.994
I mean, partly you said from yourself?

04:38.076 --> 04:42.623
I think that Jasmine, Hannah,

04:42.822 --> 04:57.100
Easton in the Holder of the World and Debbie Debbie here are three alternate versions of myself.

04:57.961 --> 05:01.826
And that these are all first contact novels.

05:03.488 --> 05:09.235
Jasmine comes to America for the first time and has to deal with it.

05:09.502 --> 05:32.640
hannah came to india coromandel coast of india for the first time and had to deal with all that alien uh feelings as well as alien culture and climate and uh debbie i think of as the 90s christopher columbus yes described as the

05:33.363 --> 05:34.284
She is the founding.

05:34.324 --> 05:37.068
Quite literally, a founding, yes.

05:38.189 --> 05:43.636
And Frankie wants to make a movie about the founding.

05:43.656 --> 05:46.559
I like Frankie.

05:46.579 --> 05:46.980
Oh, yes.

05:48.121 --> 05:52.567
And the novel changed, you know, may have been totally different.

05:53.347 --> 06:02.779
If the first draft, which I hadn't totally finished, it was three-quarters finished, on my laptop,

06:03.485 --> 06:04.466
hadn't been stolen.

06:05.688 --> 06:25.257
I had done, without making hard copy, foolish me, and gone from California to New York where we have our hovel on the Upper West Side.

06:25.675 --> 06:54.332
for a vacation my youngest sister was visiting new york visiting the states after about 20 25 years we were so happy the cops said later that we were too conspicuously happy on the streets anyway so a chinese takeout delivery gang a chinese gang one of whom was working as a takeout delivery person came and

06:54.667 --> 06:59.732
Just cleaned out my entire apartment, including the laptop.

06:59.852 --> 07:01.874
And you had never done a hard copy?

07:01.894 --> 07:02.094
No.

07:02.795 --> 07:03.135
Bad.

07:03.376 --> 07:06.399
But then I never look at my early drafts.

07:06.519 --> 07:14.667
Thank God for this odd habit of mine that I think through every draft rather than rewrite.

07:14.687 --> 07:15.348
And write them down.

07:15.648 --> 07:16.669
I do the same thing.

07:16.689 --> 07:17.690
Really, really?

07:17.770 --> 07:19.432
Yeah, I don't have an outline.

07:19.452 --> 07:22.615
My book was 638 pages.

07:22.780 --> 07:23.561
papers together.

07:23.581 --> 07:24.321
There's no papers.

07:24.381 --> 07:25.863
There were no outlines.

07:25.883 --> 07:28.325
There were no drafts.

07:29.026 --> 07:33.910
And this book I'm looking at now, my wife is now accustomed to my saying, so what are you doing?

07:34.531 --> 07:37.914
I said, I'm developing a narrative strategy.

07:37.934 --> 07:40.656
That's really what you're doing, really, isn't it?

07:41.337 --> 07:42.878
Now I make hard copies of every draft.

07:42.899 --> 07:44.520
You have to make hard copies.

07:44.540 --> 07:45.961
But I have learned the hard way.

07:46.021 --> 07:51.066
My younger daughter erased

07:51.333 --> 07:57.219
a chapter, an 18,000 word chapter in my book, and it was really, it was done, and it was wonderful.

07:57.339 --> 08:02.244
This chapter, chapter, what is chapter four, and I totally had to rewrite it again.

08:02.264 --> 08:06.148
It's better, but I lost six weeks, easily lost six weeks.

08:06.168 --> 08:08.891
Yeah, but you feel that it's better in the same way.

08:09.011 --> 08:11.333
I feel that, you know, it's all for the best.

08:11.653 --> 08:16.318
And she says, you know, I mean, it's one of these hyperventilation things we do.

08:17.039 --> 08:18.740
Yes, at the time.

08:18.821 --> 08:19.281
Oh, God.

08:19.632 --> 08:21.234
But I said, it's better.

08:21.414 --> 08:22.756
Don't worry about it.

08:22.776 --> 08:23.778
It's a much better check.

08:23.798 --> 08:24.359
But anyway.

08:24.559 --> 08:28.224
I think Frankie Fong came into the novel as a result.

08:28.584 --> 08:30.487
Is that right?

08:31.849 --> 08:31.949
Yes.

08:32.029 --> 08:42.524
And I met all these people like when I immediately had to, they were apparently trying to also siphon my bank account in California.

08:43.145 --> 08:49.133
And so I had to rush back and put in burglar alarm system in both New York and California.

08:49.467 --> 08:59.362
And the guy who was putting in the burglar alarm system in California was a Vietnam vet, former Vietnam vet.

09:00.604 --> 09:05.852
So again, a face here, an incident there, they all sort of worked.

09:05.892 --> 09:07.915
When things are going well,

09:08.317 --> 09:12.464
Everything feeds into the novel, and you feel so invincible.

09:13.445 --> 09:21.018
Well, where you say now that these are three books that are all different parts, you do obviously then see this as a continuing body of work together.

09:21.318 --> 09:22.080
Trilogy, yeah.

09:22.220 --> 09:24.243
It is a trilogy.

09:24.524 --> 09:25.606
I've not seen that.

09:25.626 --> 09:28.350
Have you expressed that before, that this is a kind of trilogy?

09:29.326 --> 09:32.029
Probably not.

09:33.410 --> 09:35.552
But did you conceive of it as a trilogy?

09:35.572 --> 09:35.632
No.

09:35.672 --> 09:37.374
You think that's the way it's more or less played out?

09:37.754 --> 09:41.458
Yeah, that it's just played out that way.

09:41.478 --> 09:50.527
Do you think all of your work will be basically a... I did an interview with Nadine Gortimer, and she gave a very interesting observation.

09:50.547 --> 09:53.249
She feels that her books, all of her books, are like walking.

09:53.269 --> 09:57.173
She compared it to walking into a room and looking at the same statue from different...

09:57.811 --> 10:01.516
No, I don't think so.

10:02.518 --> 10:19.482
In this particular novel, I was very interested in what happens when you're multiracial as opposed to uniracial, uniethnic, I'm sorry, as I am.

10:20.244 --> 10:24.730
And this is long before Tiger Woods.

10:24.845 --> 10:35.354
I heard the news and I know nothing about golf, but so many of my students are part Korean, part African-American, let's say.

10:35.814 --> 10:48.305
Or my own children, they have three mother tongues, English being predominant, but Bengali, French, and they are so many different ethnicities.

10:49.086 --> 10:54.210
And the politics of identity

10:54.781 --> 11:04.856
has become so ferociously and self-servingly about one group think, one group race.

11:04.937 --> 11:09.924
But what happens to those who are many, many different kinds?

11:10.485 --> 11:18.257
And I had already finished writing the novel, but just after I finished the final draft, I was at the

11:18.490 --> 11:20.372
Democratic National Convention.

11:20.793 --> 11:22.254
You went to the Democratic National Convention?

11:22.274 --> 11:32.585
Well, I was invited by Bill Bradley to be on that panel on racial healing with Toni Morrison and Cornel West.

11:32.766 --> 11:34.648
I thought you were just there to see it.

11:34.688 --> 11:35.869
It was a circus.

11:35.889 --> 11:40.955
It was a circus, yes.

11:41.055 --> 11:47.722
And Cornel West was so that, you know, we... And then Richard Ford as our white guy.

11:47.742 --> 11:47.822
Yes?

11:48.275 --> 11:50.899
And who's a sweetheart.

11:50.919 --> 11:59.851
And so one of the people in the audience, young people towards the end, and we're talking about 2,000 people in the field auditorium in Chicago.

12:00.993 --> 12:09.685
We're saying, what happens to those of us who want to claim not one, but both?

12:09.845 --> 12:16.915
This was a part African-American, part, I don't know, Latino or Asian.

12:17.333 --> 12:20.696
young men, and then there's a whole contingent of them.

12:20.716 --> 12:47.138
So I realized that I'm not off on a limb in some way, but that the future of America is going to be not about this kind of, and that there's in fact a danger to the politics of identity that derives its identity only from biology, ethnicity, and that we've got to think beyond race

12:47.320 --> 12:50.045
beyond ethnicity.

12:50.065 --> 13:03.067
Because I have a new population of readers, and I think the last time we spoke, my circulation was like a hundred thousand, and now it's several million.

13:03.087 --> 13:04.249
It's wonderful.

13:04.329 --> 13:09.598
It is, and I love it because I'm able to reintroduce to

13:09.832 --> 13:10.673
And they know me.

13:10.733 --> 13:13.097
I mean, my readers do get to know me after all.

13:13.137 --> 13:18.324
So it's wonderful to me because I can almost revisit areas, if you don't mind, that we have in the past.

13:18.464 --> 13:24.353
But you are, I think it's so important to emphasize your conviction that you are an American writer.

13:24.373 --> 13:27.197
Yes, and that gets me into a lot of trouble.

13:27.217 --> 13:32.505
Can you talk a little bit about that and how it even relates to this book and to the trilogy, for that matter?

13:32.525 --> 13:33.446
Yeah, yeah.

13:34.788 --> 13:35.569
And...

13:35.752 --> 13:48.992
I'll begin by giving you an example of the current issue of The New Yorker, which is devoted to Indian writing because of the 50th anniversary.

13:49.693 --> 13:55.161
Now, I have said that I'm an American writer of Indian origin, not because I'm ashamed

13:55.900 --> 14:22.279
of my past, not because I'm betraying or discarding my past, but because my whole adult life has been lived here, and I write about the people who are immigrants going through the process of making a home here, rather than writing about India in the way that Rushdie did in Midnight's Children, or that, say, Rohintan Mistri does,

14:23.052 --> 14:24.554
about Bombay.

14:24.634 --> 14:36.352
I'm not revisiting Calcutta in all my nine books, but I'm writing about people who are in different ways making their lives here.

14:36.613 --> 14:44.144
So I'm writing in the tradition of immigrant experience rather than nostalgia and expatriation.

14:45.166 --> 14:47.169
Very important.

14:47.189 --> 14:49.853
And I'm saying that for

14:50.997 --> 14:54.721
The luxury of being a U.S.

14:54.741 --> 15:18.810
citizen for me and the pleasure that I take in being American is that I can define myself not exclusively in terms of my ethnicity, but in terms of my politics, my sexual orientation maybe,

15:19.060 --> 15:30.732
education, my background, so that I can have affiliations with you on the basis of the kinds of books we read, let's say, or the kinds of music that we may like.

15:31.733 --> 15:35.977
And you're not my enemy simply because you're a white male.

15:37.719 --> 15:38.119
Middle-aged, no.

15:38.259 --> 15:39.080
Right, exactly.

15:39.220 --> 15:41.763
I'm in trouble these days.

15:41.783 --> 15:48.730
But the New Yorker, which doesn't include me in that issue,

15:49.503 --> 16:00.281
Because I've said I'm an American writer, which is perfectly fair, and Nishti has a long article on Indian literature of the Indian diaspora.

16:00.301 --> 16:03.205
And he says that I define myself as an American.

16:03.806 --> 16:04.247
Perfect.

16:05.028 --> 16:15.966
But then in the reviews, they include Leave it to Me, which is such an American book, even though it uses California, Florida Child, and

16:17.313 --> 16:26.245
South Asia in the 70s as one of the Indian books so that it's like the last place.

16:26.666 --> 16:35.938
The New Yorker doesn't feel like an American magazine or understanding of the American experience at all.

16:36.439 --> 16:42.207
But the people that I'm writing about are in some ways

16:42.423 --> 16:48.253
similar to, say, Italian-American, Irish-American, and so on.

16:50.838 --> 16:52.301
With and without the hyphen.

16:52.381 --> 16:54.364
Some of my characters want the hyphen.

16:54.565 --> 16:58.231
Others, like me, don't because of minority discourse.

16:58.532 --> 17:05.865
But it's also different because I am the color that I am.

17:06.217 --> 17:08.921
And this is the 1990s, right?

17:09.082 --> 17:25.828
And that America is not going to be as welcoming to immigrants, especially those who don't speak English or those who've snuck in and are assumed to be taking away, scapegoated as taking away jobs.

17:26.163 --> 17:38.176
as they might have been when things were less crowded and there was a lot more money to be redistributed or to be distributed.

17:39.037 --> 17:46.785
And as a result, the people that I'm writing of, there's no convention for them.

17:46.846 --> 17:47.887
There are no rules.

17:48.527 --> 17:54.634
I know if I'm writing, if I were an Italian-American or a Greek-American writer,

17:55.002 --> 18:08.436
What my community has already, there's a history of immigration for that community and how to write about how other people have written about that community.

18:09.056 --> 18:21.769
So that there's a social convention that my readers would recognize and then there's a literary convention that I would be working with or discarding.

18:22.255 --> 18:33.467
But I'm writing about people who haven't been written of before and who are like those initial pioneers, 17th century.

18:34.848 --> 18:36.170
They're larger than life.

18:36.190 --> 18:37.011
They're greedier.

18:37.771 --> 18:38.893
They're more heroic.

18:38.933 --> 18:39.733
They're grander.

18:40.294 --> 18:42.496
They're more grotesque.

18:42.516 --> 18:48.803
And so that it's all, they're indenting life second by second.

18:49.289 --> 19:01.507
And in order to understand them or have sympathy for them, you have to wear Mukherjee goggles because otherwise they don't fit.

19:01.887 --> 19:16.849
To understand who they are and where they're coming from is much harder because there's simply no readers, publishers, reviewers have little experience.

19:17.487 --> 19:22.134
Experiences in the right, precedence, models for them.

19:24.096 --> 19:27.101
Very interesting.

19:27.121 --> 19:35.272
And so in terms of also the trilogy, how this relates to the trilogy, this American-ness.

19:35.292 --> 19:38.517
There are so many ways of working out that American-ness.

19:38.537 --> 19:46.228
And to me, being American means that you are rejecting

19:46.597 --> 20:03.171
your ethnicity and religion, race, as the only way of defining yourself and saying, I'm going to give you the categories by which I wish to be

20:03.725 --> 20:10.533
Are you still identified and reduced as an Indian American?

20:10.653 --> 20:24.048
Not always, but that's still the battle after all these years that I'm having to... As much as you've stated it, how much it disturbs you to be... Yes.

20:24.428 --> 20:33.478
I think the New Yorker is probably one of the few now to insist that I'm...

20:34.032 --> 20:39.700
sort of treat me as an Indian author who, however, doesn't want to be an Indian author.

20:40.200 --> 20:54.620
But there are reviewers who don't understand the character, the immigrant experience of these non-white people in the 1990s, which is very, very different from the earlier decades.

20:54.640 --> 20:58.605
When you read this novel, there's clearly a young woman

20:58.670 --> 21:02.634
Yeah, and I'm saying I'm... From upstate New York, I mean... Exactly.

21:03.715 --> 21:12.963
And you know what pisses me off, but... Is that would they... Well, I won't use it, but it upsets you.

21:12.983 --> 21:28.137
Would they, yes, what upsets me, what disconserts me, is that would they for, oh, let's say, Opdyke, say that he is a British writer,

21:28.403 --> 21:35.550
Simply because his, yes, or Bellow is my best example.

21:36.171 --> 21:39.955
That Bellow was born outside this country.

21:39.975 --> 21:42.217
He was born in Canada.

21:42.237 --> 21:54.530
Would they call him not an American writer, but a Canadian writer, or worse, as they're doing with me, because his ancestors were Russian Jews, would they call him a Russian writer?

21:55.411 --> 21:56.672
Why are they doing it?

21:56.956 --> 21:59.799
to people of color like me.

22:00.080 --> 22:16.019
So I'm trying to expand the center of American life and literature by saying we are all part of the mainstream.

22:16.459 --> 22:17.360
There is no corruption.

22:17.781 --> 22:24.769
How does this or does this have a place in this continuing debate on the canon?

22:24.968 --> 22:33.902
the cultural wars that are going on, the debates over the various candidates.

22:34.222 --> 22:53.271
I hope not, because I feel that now that the supremacy, the hegemony, has been broken, we've all had our consciousness raised that

22:54.500 --> 23:03.672
You have to look at social and gender issues in how taste was formed.

23:04.253 --> 23:16.609
But now that we've all had that done, I think the cannon wars have degenerated into turf wars.

23:16.977 --> 23:44.115
ethnicity versus yours we've gone long beyond i want my gender versus my gender versus yes exactly and i think that we've gone long beyond uh bellow's unfortunate comment um outrageous and unfortunate comment that if there were any shakespeare's or proofs in papua new guinea we'd surely have heard

23:44.517 --> 23:48.803
I think our job is to find and understand.

23:49.123 --> 23:51.967
I'm paraphrasing it.

23:52.067 --> 23:56.753
It was published, I think, again, on the New York Times.

23:56.793 --> 24:02.260
No, I've forgotten where, but it's quite a famous quote.

24:02.681 --> 24:08.308
But now I think that it's a good book.

24:09.410 --> 24:14.136
What I do in my literature courses, Ted Burton, is...

24:14.774 --> 24:27.274
using books in order to teach how to learn from literature, how to have a bigger soul, have larger heart through literature.

24:27.875 --> 24:39.533
And if one year a Shakespeare play gets dropped, I don't do Shakespeare, but it doesn't matter if...

24:39.850 --> 24:55.897
All genders and all ethnicities are not represented, as long as the books that I have chosen make the reader understand about her or his own world a little more.

24:55.918 --> 24:58.001
So what is the course?

24:58.021 --> 24:59.544
I teach whatever.

24:59.764 --> 25:01.487
I do one fiction workshops.

25:01.855 --> 25:03.557
So that's a writing class.

25:03.717 --> 25:11.646
And then the literature course, I do one literature course every semester, is whatever topic obsesses me.

25:11.666 --> 25:27.745
And if it is an undergraduate, large undergraduate course, I'll do, say, cultures in English, meaning Anglophone novel, or literatures of the world in translation, or the short story, so that

25:28.197 --> 25:51.691
I don't feel I have to insist on statistical proportioning in the context of cannon-busting, but I am choosing what is good for the topic as long as the texts are wonderful.

25:51.711 --> 25:53.614
And I'm teaching...

25:54.168 --> 26:14.083
In the literature courses, I'm of course, because of who I am and where I come from, I'm always aware of the social, political, historical, racial context in which the characters live out their adventures.

26:14.907 --> 26:24.856
a position within these... I mean, you certainly are, you can use the phrase cannon-buster, that's the first time I wrote it, so obviously you are alert to the debate.

26:25.597 --> 26:28.620
Oh, yes, and I'm very... Yes, yes, yes.

26:29.040 --> 26:44.374
But now I want, just as I want to go beyond multiculturalism, beyond ethnicity, I want to go beyond that kind of group bashing,

26:45.265 --> 26:52.156
What are the criteria to choose a work of literature?

26:52.276 --> 26:57.604
I mean, is it great literature or does it have to be relevant?

26:57.684 --> 26:59.707
It seems to be this question of relevance.

27:00.288 --> 27:03.533
Well, I can make any, like Ovid.

27:05.256 --> 27:08.100
I love Ovid's Metamorphosis.

27:08.519 --> 27:15.988
the genesis, I can make them very relevant to today's topic.

27:16.008 --> 27:26.321
It's how you read the literature, who you are at any given time, bringing those intelligences and sensitivities to bear.

27:27.242 --> 27:29.885
That's what great literature should be about.

27:29.925 --> 27:34.611
Larger-than-life characters going through

27:35.232 --> 27:40.279
incredibly perilous, soul-risking adventures.

27:40.660 --> 27:52.417
I mean, you said before, you stated your belief that the novel certainly teaches an individual more about life and history than moral works and history.

27:52.437 --> 27:54.359
Did you maintain that skill?

27:54.660 --> 27:55.201
Yes, yes.

27:55.281 --> 27:56.262
It touches people.

27:56.697 --> 28:18.807
because it's no longer statistics but you're relating one-on-one to characters as though they are people that you know it's as though if you have a terrible disaster let's say

28:19.411 --> 28:20.413
plane is bombed.

28:21.435 --> 28:28.246
You read it in the paper or you see it in little film clips on TV, it is simply a horrible tragedy.

28:28.968 --> 28:41.770
But if you get to know one of the victims or families, the bereaved family, then you relate to that tragedy in a wholly different way.

28:42.371 --> 28:43.393
And so for me,

28:43.542 --> 29:06.310
all these protagonists or even minor characters are a way of making the mainstream reader relate to the other American in ways that are not simply newspaper, like all those nasty

29:06.914 --> 29:22.527
undocumented aliens who are taking away our jobs that we have through politicians or newspaper clips.

29:22.777 --> 29:24.700
The Carnegie Corporation.

29:25.180 --> 29:26.582
I went to see him down in town.

29:26.662 --> 29:27.824
Big loss for Brown.

29:27.904 --> 29:29.006
I don't know the new person.

29:29.026 --> 29:30.207
I'm sure that's wonderful too.

29:30.227 --> 29:31.009
He was here nine years.

29:31.109 --> 29:33.051
I think they only expected to get five out of him.

29:33.071 --> 29:34.353
So they're thrilled.

29:34.373 --> 29:36.356
But he did some wonderful things.

29:36.516 --> 29:43.206
I knew him from his, not knew him, knew him, but from the New York Public Library days.

29:43.226 --> 29:52.058
And of course, this new book I'm doing is libraries, the past and the future, reading, this whole concept of book culture.

29:52.679 --> 29:54.702
as we enter a new millennium.

29:54.822 --> 29:55.764
I hate that.

29:55.784 --> 29:59.269
I don't even want to get involved in the millennial stuff.

29:59.289 --> 29:59.870
Right.

29:59.990 --> 30:03.576
But it's really so appropriate right now because you have all these.

30:03.596 --> 30:06.541
You have libraries getting rid of books, for instance.

30:06.561 --> 30:06.901
Do you know that?

30:06.921 --> 30:11.809
I mean, actually getting rid of... In San Francisco, there was all that big... I've been following up.

30:11.829 --> 30:12.630
I was out there.

30:12.650 --> 30:13.191
Ken Dolan.

30:13.412 --> 30:14.974
Yeah, that's right.

30:15.241 --> 30:18.245
He lost his job.

30:18.505 --> 30:19.626
Yes.

30:20.127 --> 30:23.251
Nicholson Baker and Ken D'Alnetto is a lovely good one.

30:23.271 --> 30:26.014
I'm trying to get an interview with him.

30:26.094 --> 30:30.780
I've been able to connect with him sometime.

30:30.820 --> 30:35.225
He's out in Berkeley, I think, as a matter of fact.

30:35.245 --> 30:35.646
Yes.

30:35.666 --> 30:40.692
But Cornell, for instance, is where they now have 6.8 million books.

30:41.060 --> 30:46.087
And they're actually going to reduce that to five million by the year 2000.

30:46.107 --> 30:48.450
So, you know, these are very interesting.

30:48.470 --> 30:49.011
That's scary.

30:49.031 --> 30:49.612
It is scary.

30:49.632 --> 30:53.617
And they say, well, there are books that people never use.

30:53.637 --> 31:02.950
But does that mean that popularity is... Does it mean that just because, let us say, more...

31:02.930 --> 31:05.955
Danielle Steele novels are checked out of libraries.

31:06.055 --> 31:07.117
Yeah, yeah.

31:07.157 --> 31:10.362
Well, you can actually document pieces now.

31:10.382 --> 31:11.745
I'm doing it.

31:11.805 --> 31:16.292
As much as I enjoyed it, I really kind of missed the point.

31:16.312 --> 31:17.514
I really just focused on things.

31:17.534 --> 31:19.618
This is going on everywhere.

31:19.638 --> 31:24.786
I mean, really, you have libraries that are getting rid of books that are 150 years old.

31:24.766 --> 31:26.848
because nobody's asking for it.

31:26.928 --> 31:30.431
But libraries all over the country are getting rid of the same books.

31:30.471 --> 31:34.395
So I wouldn't even be a bit surprised if some of those books in San Francisco got rid of.

31:34.415 --> 31:36.837
We're the last known copies in public collections.

31:37.078 --> 31:42.923
We really are going to have cases where the last known copy is being disposed of.

31:42.943 --> 31:45.846
No, no, no, no, but that's fascinating.

31:45.866 --> 31:53.473
And at the same time, I understand about technology and that we have to find new ways

31:53.740 --> 32:10.401
of storing and distributing.

32:12.143 --> 32:19.512
They did the same thing in Bosnia.

32:19.492 --> 32:21.615
It was a deliberate attempt.

32:21.635 --> 32:22.696
I've already interviewed the library.

32:23.177 --> 32:26.000
Oh, the national... 1.2 million books.

32:26.020 --> 32:43.281
Right, because I was going to do, and Ken Dowlin was going to help provide the atrium of that wonderful atrium for a fundraiser in order to raise $4 million, we hoped, for rebuilding the Bosnian National Library building.

32:43.481 --> 32:43.642
Right.

32:43.662 --> 32:45.884
Well, there was a lot of learnings here last fall.

32:47.006 --> 32:48.908
It was the effort to...

32:48.888 --> 32:51.172
replicate as best they can.

32:51.793 --> 32:55.318
The books digitally is right over at Harvard.

32:56.240 --> 32:56.500
Uh-huh.

32:56.520 --> 32:57.642
So I'm setting it up for six hours.

32:57.662 --> 33:04.072
He literally just describes what it's like to catch a bold, a burning leaf with it in the script.

33:04.092 --> 33:04.512
Oh, oh, oh.

33:04.673 --> 33:08.078
And in your hands, the letters, you know, turn to certain threads.

33:08.058 --> 33:11.745
You can actually feel the letters in your hand.

33:11.765 --> 33:12.045
Right.

33:12.386 --> 33:15.772
I mean, it really is a cultural side.

33:16.212 --> 33:17.094
It is.

33:17.174 --> 33:23.025
Like genocide, that you are aiming, you're targeting the extermination of the culture.

33:23.045 --> 33:30.859
And if you intend to exterminate people, then you do have to exterminate the memory.

33:30.979 --> 33:31.319
Yes.

33:31.339 --> 33:31.720
It's essential.

33:31.700 --> 33:49.287
But we saw in Hungary, with the reburial of the five martyrs in 1989, how in Budapest they

33:49.655 --> 33:59.073
oral history, then there's a resurgence of oral history so that people will pass it on when you're not allowed to write it.

34:00.175 --> 34:03.882
What did that have to do in Budapest?

34:04.002 --> 34:07.849
I was there for a weekend

34:08.065 --> 34:11.632
international conference where they brought writers from all over the world.

34:12.173 --> 34:23.897
Just the week that the five martyrs were reburied and hooked, a lot of the Eastern European and especially the Hungarian writers were saying,

34:24.248 --> 34:31.676
that we kept it alive through orality.

34:32.197 --> 34:33.598
That's fantastic.

34:34.079 --> 34:35.561
You were not allowed to talk about it.

34:36.261 --> 34:37.943
Books were banned and so on.

34:38.103 --> 34:40.626
I should be able to find some literature on this.

34:40.666 --> 34:41.067
Maybe.

34:42.148 --> 34:44.771
Because it is very interesting.

34:44.811 --> 34:47.674
There was more Cambodian history.

34:48.143 --> 34:55.075
in New York than there is in Cambodia, because they have these fantastic collections, which have been built up.

34:55.136 --> 35:00.806
And so now what they've done with the new government is that they are giving them digital copies of their own history.

35:01.166 --> 35:02.168
How interesting.

35:02.248 --> 35:02.769
Fascinating.

35:02.789 --> 35:04.853
And then they also sent teams over there.

35:04.833 --> 35:13.805
to microfilm the palm leaf manuscripts and the palm leaf libraries.

35:13.825 --> 35:14.606
My God!

35:14.786 --> 35:17.430
I don't know how it's going to work into this.

35:17.450 --> 35:18.992
I'm sorry to go off.

35:19.092 --> 35:19.392
No, no, no.

35:19.432 --> 35:21.415
This is totally mesmerizing.

35:21.435 --> 35:23.037
Barton told me about it.

35:23.057 --> 35:31.448
He said, you know, when there was an old poem in the early 1800s, the Polish National Library was in Paris.

35:31.732 --> 35:43.217
And to this day, after I can go to Paris in a week and a half, the Bibliothèque Polonaise is still there, and that's the actual time we've worked in.

35:43.237 --> 35:48.028
There was a greater library, and that was the repository of Polish culture.

35:48.048 --> 35:50.854
It was in Paris when there was no Polish.

35:51.256 --> 35:54.501
Well, libraries, you're all reading.

35:54.521 --> 35:56.363
I mean, I've read that you read.

35:56.383 --> 35:58.246
I research like crazy.

35:58.286 --> 36:01.150
But as a child, you read through.

36:01.170 --> 36:01.330
Yes.

36:01.510 --> 36:01.971
Everything.

36:02.612 --> 36:05.516
Are you a product of your reading and all?

36:05.776 --> 36:06.177
Totally.

36:06.477 --> 36:11.965
I'm a product of my reading, and I think that that's why...

36:12.400 --> 36:26.048
I'm not bound by the political correctness restrictions that if you're a woman, you write only from a woman's point of view.

36:26.128 --> 36:30.758
If you're a male, don't you dare write from a woman's point of view all about race.

36:30.858 --> 36:32.822
Because I grew up reading

36:32.802 --> 36:47.303
about societies, Dostoev's novels, Gorky's, because for some reason those Russian novels were very easily available in Bengali translation in the fifties.

36:49.687 --> 36:55.215
I don't know how I put myself in that situation, and I was reading these novels

36:55.195 --> 36:59.741
before I knew a word of English.

37:00.882 --> 37:02.664
So that I had never been to Europe.

37:02.685 --> 37:06.549
There was no question of my ever leaving Calcutta.

37:07.771 --> 37:11.776
But I was able to absorb their lives, live through them.

37:12.337 --> 37:16.102
These characters were very much alive in my head, and I must have Bengali-ized them.

37:16.702 --> 37:20.427
And I read all the...

37:21.233 --> 37:27.746
I would take a single author and read everything by her or him.

37:27.987 --> 37:36.284
And so all of Goldsworthy, all of Bennett, all of Wells, and of course all of Jane Austen and the Brompton sisters.

37:36.304 --> 37:36.965
And they were all available.

37:37.847 --> 37:38.348
Yes.

37:38.328 --> 37:44.137
And not only that, this is so bizarre, Oxford Lending Library.

37:44.157 --> 37:59.020
You would have books everywhere in Calcutta in the 50s and 60s, so that whether they are on pavements just outside

37:59.185 --> 38:02.789
a restaurant that you're going into or a drugstore that you're going into.

38:03.390 --> 38:14.862
And then you had bookstores that lent books because they were so expensive to buy, they found that it was easier to let you rent books to read.

38:15.303 --> 38:24.713
And then the Oxford Lending, a very old-fashioned and it's still going strong bookstore in Calcutta called the Oxford Lending Library.

38:25.194 --> 38:29.158
And it was filled with

38:29.392 --> 38:32.598
Victorian harrow literature.

38:32.618 --> 38:49.948
All these women authors with missus in front of their names and they wrote melodramas, but we read them with equal pleasure and we were supposed to respect them equally.

38:49.928 --> 38:59.337
There was no valuation, no discrimination between highbrow literature, middlebrow literature, and so on.

38:59.457 --> 39:02.420
I really haven't questioned you anything about the book.

39:02.440 --> 39:04.842
That's my job.

39:05.743 --> 39:05.903
Yeah.

39:05.923 --> 39:18.855
But did you, would you describe... It comes back to the ability to enter those very alien lives, alien cultures,

39:18.835 --> 39:39.851
and absorb it, totally understand it, or creatively misunderstand it, I think is what has made me a writer, so that I can become an Italian-American adoptee into an Italian-American, because I know upstate New York very well.

39:39.891 --> 39:42.155
You had to be disconnected here.

39:42.175 --> 39:44.218
What in the world is she doing about this?

39:44.755 --> 39:46.479
I know Saratoga Springs.

39:46.659 --> 39:48.743
I used to own a home and I've taught it.

39:48.944 --> 39:53.273
And you really have lived of that kind of pathetic life.

39:53.293 --> 39:56.419
And by the way, is your husband still in Iowa?

39:56.579 --> 39:56.780
Yes.

39:57.241 --> 39:57.481
Yes.

39:58.002 --> 40:00.507
And so we're communicating.

40:00.708 --> 40:03.253
It's a tractable situation, apparently, I guess it works.

40:05.444 --> 40:21.219
And I'm going to teach, I taught at the Writers' Workshop last fall, and I'm going back again to teach in Iowa this fall, so that Iowa's, we're our central home.

40:21.239 --> 40:26.183
I spent over two weeks in Iowa when I was writing my book.

40:26.203 --> 40:32.329
Right, I remember your story about that.

40:32.309 --> 40:35.732
That was my big chapter there.

40:36.553 --> 40:40.016
Everybody wants to know about the books.

40:40.036 --> 40:41.217
Yes, that was fascinating.

40:41.237 --> 40:44.060
26,000 books worth 20 million dollars because he loved them.

40:44.080 --> 40:46.402
He stole them, not from the fact that they were valuable.

40:46.783 --> 40:49.886
He wanted to have one of them.

40:49.906 --> 40:50.026
Right.

40:50.046 --> 40:50.546
Let's see.

40:50.566 --> 40:58.654
Let's see if that's about... Yeah, and...

40:59.056 --> 41:19.883
The novel, the last version of this last draft of this novel came to me as soon as I understood I was doing the Mahabhavi story, the prologue that opens it about the goddess Devi.

41:19.863 --> 41:49.431
because it's good fighting evil, good slaying evil, but there's such a twist to what it is to be why one is good and why one is bad, or is bad really simply force of nature, because when Mahadevi is told by the gods to arm herself and, you know, empower herself and slay the buffalo demon, the buffalo demon is doing his

41:49.411 --> 42:00.510
buffalo demonish thing, demoniacal or whatever thing, because that's his heritage, right?

42:00.570 --> 42:01.632
I mean, he can't help it.

42:02.173 --> 42:04.517
And so Davey,

42:04.497 --> 42:11.837
is the agent of the gods, if you like.

42:12.339 --> 42:16.289
She is an avenging god, but she's also a force of nature.

42:16.350 --> 42:20.160
And there comes a moment in the novel towards the end

42:20.140 --> 42:31.402
when she slaves the buffalo demon, and I won't give away who that is for your readers, and that's redemptive.

42:32.705 --> 42:37.474
I'm not interested in simply case history.

42:37.910 --> 42:42.437
a pathological, psychopathic case of a serial killer.

42:43.218 --> 42:48.906
I'm interested in mythologizing the killer.

42:48.926 --> 42:50.188
Do you see it as a dark novel?

42:51.430 --> 42:54.394
I think of it as both dark and very funny.

42:55.316 --> 43:01.605
I think of myself as a weirdly comic writer, and I think that that's

43:01.940 --> 43:29.010
what role is some people that I'm not doing the demure multiculti thing nor am I doing the sort of National Geographic kind of multiculti number but that I hope people have come to expect from the world that I present in fiction a great deal of

43:29.176 --> 43:40.636
ambition, heroism, grotesquery, sex, and violence.

43:47.108 --> 43:54.120
The character dictates the voice, and I know that I haven't gotten it to the right draft until the voice is right.

43:54.725 --> 44:02.874
And do you think if you were to read from these three books and this film people's voice... Yes, and I can't help it.

44:03.054 --> 44:06.278
And then you would absolutely assume that voice.

44:06.498 --> 44:09.221
People have remarked on them about that.

44:09.881 --> 44:19.652
I think that we've got, it's five o'clock, and I'm just going to take a quick look at lots of stuff here.

44:19.632 --> 44:27.769
I think we talked about the American psyche and talked all about that.

44:27.889 --> 44:30.094
And, of course, storytelling.

44:30.114 --> 44:32.338
The story is the story of the thing.

44:32.358 --> 44:41.016
And to me, big character and big story that...

44:42.076 --> 44:50.764
What puts the soul in peril is important.

44:50.884 --> 44:57.350
I'm less interested in sort of pretty writing.

44:59.652 --> 45:05.377
I'm not at all interested in pretty writing, but in high-octane energy and big story.

45:05.397 --> 45:08.460
Do you hear from readers that are in the vital signs of voices?

45:09.000 --> 45:10.662
I get a lot of mail.

45:10.962 --> 45:11.863
Do you have a sense of being readers?

45:11.843 --> 45:22.856
An incredible cross-section, so that I'll have lawyers and doctors and orthopedic surgeons, for example, writing.

45:22.876 --> 45:36.994
I'll have businessmen sending photographs, and then, since they're published in other languages, an awful lot to be brought to students.

45:37.174 --> 45:39.657
I'd like you to have a reason to remind me of writing.

45:39.637 --> 45:46.718
I'm really just, the character's telling me what it's going to do.

45:46.738 --> 45:48.825
I'm in a trance.

45:48.925 --> 45:51.051
Really?

45:51.272 --> 45:51.553
Yeah.

45:51.573 --> 45:52.817
When you're writing?

45:52.837 --> 45:52.937
Yeah.

45:53.086 --> 45:54.368
What else?

45:54.428 --> 45:58.514
What else can I ask you that I do?

45:58.794 --> 46:13.035
Is there anything that I do to you that I should know that you haven't covered before?

46:13.015 --> 46:16.939
The rule to save and the strength to kill.

46:17.379 --> 46:20.522
I like that line.

46:20.562 --> 46:23.425
You have two people with him, and she's with Frank.

46:23.445 --> 46:23.946
Vietnam.

46:24.386 --> 46:38.500
Maybe the only thing that we haven't talked about is that the central experience of the central stimulus for these characters is the

46:38.834 --> 46:52.978
Vietnamization of America and that they are all the characters are responding somehow to the Vietnam

46:53.313 --> 47:18.949
catastrophe, and Loco Larry is named by it, the film producer, lover is... Right, and that whole seven... Yes, who now have become, like, trying to see from Davy's point of view how much of it was really an excuse for

47:19.165 --> 47:28.403
excessive narcissism, self-indulgence, even though they did a lot of good through the peace movement.

47:28.423 --> 47:38.102
And then Debbie herself is the child of the Vietnam protests and reactions, the garbage sack left on the

47:38.268 --> 47:39.151
Hippie Trail.

47:39.832 --> 47:52.328
And Romeo, Romeo Hawk, is part Vietnamese and part South Asian who is, again, refugee.

47:53.017 --> 48:04.095
There were incidents like... But this is something that has been for us through generations?

48:04.115 --> 48:13.911
That we're going to have to... We're no longer the America that I read about or saw in MGM musicals.

48:14.380 --> 48:18.327
about America when I was in Calcutta, right?

48:18.347 --> 48:35.376
And that this is the 90s, late 90s, or millennial America in which you have to decide what it means to be an American, not in terms.

48:35.812 --> 48:45.805
of your European heritage, or your African-American, or any kind of ethnic heritage, but claiming the hate of all places as home.

48:45.905 --> 48:51.271
You should say my 14-year-old, wonderful actress.

48:51.291 --> 48:53.014
You should see her watching.

48:53.654 --> 48:54.936
She loves to watch.

48:55.076 --> 48:58.661
I love Lucy in three months.

48:58.821 --> 48:59.842
Nostalgia.

49:00.042 --> 49:01.144
Virtual nostalgia.

49:01.244 --> 49:02.966
It's like watching Star Trek.

49:02.986 --> 49:05.329
It's a totally alien world.

49:05.309 --> 49:10.483
You know, Lucy and Desi in the 50s.

49:10.503 --> 49:11.666
Oh, that's lovely.

49:11.747 --> 49:13.872
It's a totally different America than it is.

49:13.892 --> 49:13.993
Yeah.

49:14.013 --> 49:15.958
And you say, Dad, did they really use that?

49:15.978 --> 49:16.720
I mean, it's...

49:17.138 --> 49:20.162
and that sense of humor.

49:20.182 --> 49:21.644
Artifacts.

49:21.804 --> 49:28.192
I'm sorry to ask you to do this with only one arm.

49:28.212 --> 49:36.542
I have a pen if you need one or you have one.

49:38.084 --> 49:40.327
This is a good model.

49:40.347 --> 49:42.049
We fill an hour.

49:43.345 --> 49:50.295
Do you see these whole, and you said that you don't outline and you don't draft, but do you see it all or is it a developing thing?

49:50.315 --> 49:50.996
It develops.

49:51.237 --> 50:02.814
I have the sense of character and a couple of scenes, but I have, and sometimes I think I know how it's going to end, but it never ends.

50:03.114 --> 50:05.037
This is quite an ending.

50:05.057 --> 50:06.399
It's quite an ending.

50:06.519 --> 50:12.728
And you know, it is going to happen, and I won't tell you what year.

50:12.708 --> 50:16.466
But I think I know where I'm going.

50:16.547 --> 50:16.949
Come on.

50:17.170 --> 50:17.250
Yes.

50:17.270 --> 50:19.461
When I was in the Navy, it was funny.
