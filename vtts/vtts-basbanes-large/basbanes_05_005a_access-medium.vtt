WEBVTT

00:03.254 --> 00:10.445
We're talking to Professor Brian Fagan, and you say that these are compilations.

00:11.186 --> 00:13.170
Maybe we can just enter the discussion there.

00:13.230 --> 00:14.191
Well, they're edited books.

00:16.074 --> 00:21.162
Both are edited books and published by Oxford University Press' Trade Reference Department,

00:21.547 --> 00:25.798
probably one of the finest reference departments, certainly in American publishing.

00:25.818 --> 00:33.218
Well, I think the Companion series, it's just an extraordinary series of books, unique.

00:33.258 --> 00:35.725
I can't think of anything else anywhere that

00:36.329 --> 00:37.270
that approaches them.

00:37.290 --> 00:39.294
I mean, it's not just a reference book.

00:39.314 --> 00:48.327
And I think what you have attempted to do here is gather many, many learned essays, especially for the companion book.

00:48.768 --> 00:55.198
Tell me a little bit about your own interest in archaeology, two books here now, many others.

00:55.178 --> 01:00.163
I've written, well, it depends how you cut the cat, but I think I've written about 36 books.

01:00.183 --> 01:01.845
36 books.

01:01.865 --> 01:05.569
Of which about 16 or 17 or 18 are probably archaeology.

01:05.589 --> 01:08.452
I also write about sailing, which is my other hat.

01:09.233 --> 01:14.098
And I started off my career, I went to Cambridge in England and studied archaeology there.

01:14.759 --> 01:20.545
And then I, in 1959, went out to Africa and worked there for seven years studying and working on...

01:21.503 --> 01:27.410
early African history, that's black African history, which at the time was almost unknown, and was in on the ground floor of that.

01:28.271 --> 01:38.883
And then in 1966, I came over to the United States, spent a year at the University of Illinois in Champaign, and then came out to California, and I've been a professor at the University here ever since.

01:39.263 --> 01:41.946
And since being in this country, I've become a generalist.

01:41.966 --> 01:47.713
I'm one of the few people in archaeology who is not a specialist who writes about archaeology for the general public.

01:48.284 --> 01:50.286
It's not done for 30 years.

01:50.306 --> 02:09.343
And I think this Eyewitness to Discovery book is a terrific idea, because when we think of discovery, of course, we visualize the people who find these wonderful things, but how often do we also realize that they articulated their findings in words?

02:10.104 --> 02:16.570
Yes, and one of the interesting things about it is the most articulate people were the people up to about 19...

02:16.972 --> 02:25.985
30, after then, archaeology got much more specialized, and people got more academic in their writing, and there isn't nearly so much exciting writing as there used to be, which is a pity.

02:26.366 --> 02:29.590
Yeah, because, well, there was that sense of derring-do also, though.

02:29.610 --> 02:31.393
That's true, absolutely right.

02:31.754 --> 02:39.785
And maybe some of the great discoveries were, although spectacular, and not particularly scientific either.

02:40.146 --> 02:42.149
They had an understatement, they weren't.

02:42.169 --> 02:46.455
But there was a sort of panache, and that's what they call the Indiana Jones Syndrome in this day and age,

02:46.807 --> 02:48.830
What syndrome again, sir?

02:49.431 --> 02:50.553
I'm sorry, what syndrome again?

02:50.573 --> 02:51.174
Indiana Jones.

02:51.194 --> 02:52.015
Okay, fine, yeah.

02:52.496 --> 03:02.611
A panache, which actually is brilliantly captured by that lady who writes Egyptian mysteries with Amelia Peabody.

03:02.631 --> 03:03.412
Are you familiar with her?

03:03.432 --> 03:03.993
No, I'm not.

03:04.013 --> 03:06.337
There's a lady who writes a series of detective stories.

03:06.397 --> 03:07.438
Her name is Peters, I think.

03:07.779 --> 03:13.708
They're wonderful because she's sort of captured the atmosphere of the 1880s and 90s in Egypt and so on.

03:14.127 --> 03:16.870
adventuring, extraordinary discoveries and so on.

03:17.691 --> 03:23.237
And since 1920, archaeologists changed and become much more narrow and specialized.

03:23.337 --> 03:31.946
And today, if you make a great discovery, your big concern is that you're going to study it right and publish it right rather than be excited for the general public.

03:32.627 --> 03:37.392
What do you think are some of the great discoveries that remain to be made?

03:37.412 --> 03:41.316
Oh, absolutely the area of the world which is going to be

03:41.819 --> 03:46.084
dramatically unveiled, I think, in the next 50 years is China.

03:47.025 --> 03:59.981
Royal tombs in China, and as the Chinese develop an expertise in the recovery of these burials, and one of the very, very nice things about the Chinese is that they are not arrogant.

04:00.001 --> 04:09.312
And as archaeologists, they say we lack the technical ability or the facilities to excavate these tombs, like the tomb of the first emperor of China,

04:09.713 --> 04:14.258
and they just leave it alone until they judge that they're ready, which is refreshing in this day and age.

04:14.759 --> 04:25.731
And, of course, being the kind of government that they are, they can have a pretty good control over plunderers, I guess, too.

04:25.751 --> 04:33.339
Oh, yeah, and they also have a very careful control over the tidal wave of foreign archaeologists who would love to work in China.

04:34.641 --> 04:39.366
They have a very controlled environment, which actually, in some ways, is a good thing.

04:40.004 --> 04:55.186
Now, that's, of course, Asia, but how about things that might be of particular interest, say, to those of us with a Western bent, great historical discoveries with names that might even resonate?

04:55.506 --> 05:00.874
You mentioned here Antony and Cleopatra here, these kinds of things.

05:01.034 --> 05:07.243
I think we're going to find one of the most exciting discoveries in recent years has been the discovery of

05:07.696 --> 05:13.767
a garrison on the Roman wall where they found documents written on birch.

05:14.208 --> 05:14.729
Come on.

05:15.069 --> 05:15.390
Birch.

05:15.510 --> 05:16.131
Oh, yeah.

05:16.211 --> 05:16.913
A slivers of birch.

05:16.933 --> 05:17.574
It's not in the book.

05:18.295 --> 05:21.501
At a place called Vindolanda.

05:21.521 --> 05:27.572
I think what's going to happen is you're not going to get so much spectacular discovery from digging, as I say in the book.

05:27.592 --> 05:29.555
You're going to get more and more of them out of labs.

05:30.116 --> 05:31.138
I mean, in these days,

05:31.338 --> 05:34.982
You can tell whether people are left-handed when they make stone tools.

05:35.403 --> 05:40.649
You can trace the sources of clay pots from the materials in them using high-tech science.

05:40.689 --> 05:49.760
And I think one of the big dramatic discoveries in the next 50 years again is going to be what comes out of the lab rather than what comes out of the ground very often.

05:49.780 --> 05:52.883
A lot of this, of course, is interpretation as well, isn't it?

05:52.923 --> 05:57.108
There's still a great deal of room for controversy, I would imagine.

05:57.208 --> 05:58.510
Oh, indeed.

05:59.384 --> 06:01.266
The more we know, the more controversy there is.

06:01.306 --> 06:08.554
In fact, one of the classics is the first discovery of the Americas, which some people think was the first settlement.

06:08.694 --> 06:10.676
It was 40,000 years ago.

06:10.736 --> 06:12.218
Most people think it was 15.

06:12.258 --> 06:12.958
Who is right?

06:13.319 --> 06:15.421
And in the next 50 years, we may find out.

06:16.082 --> 06:19.065
How do you suppose we would be able to determine that?

06:19.325 --> 06:25.932
Just simply by finding the incredibly small archaeological sites where these things

06:27.295 --> 06:28.076
are preserved.

06:28.236 --> 06:34.025
And unfortunately, it's so long ago, and a lot of these people were moving around, they left very little behind them, and it's difficult to find it.

06:34.565 --> 06:37.990
Tell me a little bit about, you mentioned that you studied at Cambridge.

06:38.831 --> 06:41.335
Can you tell me a little bit about your own work in the field?

06:41.916 --> 06:50.007
Well, I worked for seven years on late historical sites in Central Africa, mainly in Zambia.

06:50.548 --> 06:53.252
And what we were looking at was the first settlement

06:53.671 --> 06:59.984
of the area by the ancestors of the peoples who live there today, all of whom settled there in the last 2,000 years.

07:01.126 --> 07:11.106
And this involved digging, farming villages, and working on very complicated tribal histories involving not only historical records but oral traditions.

07:11.896 --> 07:19.264
And when it came, when you decided to do this companion, that must have been a daunting, intimidating assignment.

07:19.344 --> 07:22.607
I was actually asked by Oxford University Press to do it.

07:22.827 --> 07:23.828
I didn't have the idea.

07:23.848 --> 07:29.735
A number of archaeologists, they were canvassing archaeologists to see if it was worth doing.

07:29.755 --> 07:32.658
And believe it or not, there were some who said it wasn't, which I think is stupid.

07:33.579 --> 07:38.764
And then some other archaeologists said, well, you should talk to Fagan because he's a generalist.

07:39.301 --> 07:45.668
And they approached me, and my first reaction was exactly, as you said, is, my God, how are we going to do this?

07:46.209 --> 07:55.499
But the way Oxford do these is that they do revolve the books around very stimulating themes, and the challenge of developing the themes got me into it.

07:56.120 --> 08:01.506
And it wasn't until I'd done that I realized that we were ending up with 300 contributors and 700 entries.

08:02.007 --> 08:02.087
Wow.

08:02.547 --> 08:04.029
Huge.

08:04.429 --> 08:06.692
I had a sort of editorial board of

08:07.043 --> 08:36.730
four colleagues who were wonderful and the community of archaeologists responded and the result is a massive I think definitive statement of what archaeology is how it works and why it's important in today's world and also what we know about the past I think it's very important to point out that these companions as you point out are thematic you know it's it's they are not merely encyclopedia encyclopedic compendia I mean they you do production we lay out very carefully

08:36.963 --> 08:38.505
what it is and what it is not.

08:39.506 --> 08:40.307
And that's the right.

08:40.327 --> 08:42.790
It revolves around five or six very important themes.

08:42.810 --> 08:44.773
I mean, it can actually be read as a book.

08:46.354 --> 08:46.895
My sympathy.

08:47.976 --> 09:04.877
But yes, I mean, you can take an issue and just track through with all the different cross-reference systems, and you can study, for example, early human evolution from the angle of the fossils, the angle of the archaeology of an area, the angle of particular sites, the angle of the people who found the stuff,

09:05.228 --> 09:09.433
and get it from all sorts of different angles or just follow your nose deeper and deeper into a subject.

09:09.493 --> 09:10.094
It's great fun.

09:10.775 --> 09:15.561
And how about assembling the staff of contributors?

09:16.022 --> 09:28.557
That was very straightforward because the key is to choose a really good editorial board who are first-rate scholars and yet have a vision and share your vision of what the book did.

09:28.938 --> 09:31.681
In this one, we chose four people, none of whom knew each other.

09:32.102 --> 09:34.645
And Oxford pulled us together in New York for a meeting

09:34.928 --> 09:39.232
And we spent two days having each developed our image of what our sections were.

09:39.252 --> 09:40.553
We divide the book up in sections.

09:41.114 --> 09:45.898
And to our astonishment, not only did everyone 90% agree, but they all got on like house and fire.

09:46.498 --> 09:46.679
Wow.

09:46.919 --> 09:50.422
And Oxford said this is a somewhat rare occurrence.

09:50.482 --> 09:54.706
And we really had absolutely no tensions between the board at all.

09:55.527 --> 10:00.451
And it turns out that each member knew people in their area.

10:00.771 --> 10:02.573
And if they didn't, they knew people who did.

10:02.907 --> 10:06.690
And using networks of people we knew, we put together the contributors.

10:07.071 --> 10:12.075
And in each case, you put together a contributor and an alternate, because in case someone turns it down.

10:12.535 --> 10:18.060
And then you have the additional problem, of course, which is the toughest problem with a book like this, are the people who do not deliver.

10:19.321 --> 10:24.546
And this drives you nuts, and you've just got to pursue people and live with it.

10:24.686 --> 10:28.549
I mean, this is not for my piece, but do people get paid for this?

10:28.589 --> 10:29.850
They get a very modest thing.

10:29.991 --> 10:31.632
I think it's about 10 cents a word.

10:31.612 --> 10:33.936
It's prestigious to write for a companion.

10:33.956 --> 10:34.898
Well, I would think so.

10:34.958 --> 10:36.862
To be glimpsed in that environment.

10:36.882 --> 10:40.048
In fact, I'm getting letters from people saying, now how nice, I'm so glad to be in there.

10:40.869 --> 10:43.414
But if you have any illusions, it's going to be possible.

10:44.075 --> 10:45.979
Now, you mentioned New York.

10:46.019 --> 10:49.124
This was not a U.K.-driven... This was a New York companion.

10:49.184 --> 10:55.476
Both New York and England do companions, and New York actually is assuming quite a leading role in doing them.

10:56.300 --> 11:01.366
They really are two separate publishing entities in a way, aren't they?

11:01.686 --> 11:04.409
They do consult and they also compete, I think, to some degree.

11:04.669 --> 11:06.671
The politics are complex, I suspect.

11:08.153 --> 11:09.995
But this is purely a New York book.

11:10.015 --> 11:20.827
But I think the American unit of Oxford is almost, I mean, they have entered the trade field in a very aggressive way, I think.

11:20.967 --> 11:21.547
Very aggressively.

11:21.708 --> 11:22.488
And they're doing so.

11:22.508 --> 11:23.910
Also, they're adding staff and

11:24.262 --> 11:24.884
and doing more.

11:24.924 --> 11:26.588
And there are wonderful people to work with.

11:26.609 --> 11:28.073
I have no complaints about Oxford.

11:28.093 --> 11:29.116
Oh, I love Oxford.

11:29.136 --> 11:37.579
I mean, and the bottom line matters, which is, you know, so unusual when you come to... The bottom line matters, and quality, quality, quality, quality of content...

11:37.846 --> 11:39.948
quality of products.

11:40.248 --> 11:42.390
It's a joy to work with.

11:42.410 --> 11:45.693
Now tell me about the other book, the new one, which I just got.

11:45.713 --> 11:46.574
You'll have to forgive me.

11:47.395 --> 11:57.825
We just got it two days ago, so I can't... What they normally do with an Oxford companion is put together a series of accompanying volumes.

11:57.845 --> 12:00.588
There are a couple of other projects running which are going with this companion.

12:01.509 --> 12:02.850
They always do an anthology.

12:03.811 --> 12:06.233
This anthology is a

12:06.989 --> 12:14.316
anthology of first-hand descriptions of archaeological discoveries, preferably by the people who wrote them, who found the sites.

12:14.917 --> 12:23.906
For example, you'll find John Lloyd Stevens, the guy who found the Maya there, you'll find Austen Henry Layard in there, et cetera, et cetera, or Leakey in there.

12:23.926 --> 12:29.111
And really, you try and get an immediacy to the discovery by using first-hand accounts.

12:29.131 --> 12:31.554
And of course, and then the excitement of discovery.

12:31.654 --> 12:32.695
Yes, exactly.

12:32.735 --> 12:35.578
And actually, one of the best passages, I think,

12:35.896 --> 12:46.425
is a passage written by a lady called Mary Chubb, C-H-U-B-B, about working at Almana in Egypt and what she felt when she found the figurine.

12:47.247 --> 12:49.433
And that really is the essence of what it's all about.

12:50.375 --> 12:52.457
You know, I found similar.

12:52.477 --> 12:56.703
People say, why do people collect first editions of books?

12:56.763 --> 13:02.569
Why are they willing to spend, you know, tremendous amounts of money for what amounts of, you know, pieces of paper?

13:03.691 --> 13:05.092
I'm not.

13:05.112 --> 13:05.994
I write the damn thing.

13:06.194 --> 13:08.617
Are you a bibliophile?

13:08.637 --> 13:08.877
No.

13:09.878 --> 13:14.003
But I mean, it was burnt down in 1977, Nick, and I lost all my books.

13:14.523 --> 13:15.645
I'm sorry, what happened again?

13:15.926 --> 13:16.747
My house burned down.

13:16.767 --> 13:17.329
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:17.429 --> 13:21.898
I lost 3,500 books, and since then I've barely bought books.

13:21.958 --> 13:23.781
I find it very hard.

13:23.801 --> 13:25.845
I understand Frank Kermode recently.

13:25.926 --> 13:31.236
There was an item in the TLS where his library was destroyed in a fire.

13:31.436 --> 13:31.677
Really?

13:31.857 --> 13:32.719
I didn't know that.

13:32.739 --> 13:34.102
Yeah, this was about a month or two ago.

13:34.422 --> 13:36.767
Mine went, and people were very generous with placing it.

13:37.017 --> 13:39.721
Generally, since then, I haven't collected books.

13:39.741 --> 13:41.924
But my point is, you know, you feel something.

13:42.204 --> 13:49.415
You know, if it's something contemporaneous or something that an author handled, you can't define it.

13:49.435 --> 13:49.915
You feel it.

13:50.056 --> 14:01.131
And I think even more so in archaeology, when you feel, when you pick something up, as you're describing this woman picking something up, you know, it's a magical, I suspect it's a magical feeling.

14:01.632 --> 14:02.253
It's a lure.

14:02.493 --> 14:06.619
It's a lure that's less common now than it used to be because...

14:06.937 --> 14:13.106
people now are so scientific that they're much more concerned that they've done the job right, which is good.

14:13.126 --> 14:16.912
They're more conserved information than a discovery.

14:17.192 --> 14:30.292
One of the best-handled discoveries of recent years are the lords of Sipan, these spectacular graves in Peru of warrior priests whose wealth, I think, exceeds Tutankhamen.

14:30.312 --> 14:31.274
I think the tombs are better.

14:31.634 --> 14:32.015
Really?

14:32.055 --> 14:36.201
People who've done that have taken extraordinary efforts to conserve the material,

14:36.518 --> 14:39.583
and to record it right, and it really is a triumph.

14:40.365 --> 14:45.313
There have been some stories recently in the New York Times about Afghanistan, for instance.

14:45.353 --> 14:47.437
Oh, the place just getting looted there.

14:47.497 --> 14:49.380
And when you see something like that, what do you feel?

14:49.961 --> 14:51.884
Disgust, horror.

14:51.904 --> 14:55.130
You feel almost raped.

14:55.150 --> 15:01.260
People have no respect for the past, and when you get down to it, to those people it's just money and loot.

15:01.882 --> 15:08.295
On the other side of the coin, you're dealing with war zones, you're dealing with people who are chronically poor, and so on and so forth.

15:08.315 --> 15:13.967
But it's a tragedy for the whole of humankind because in the final analysis, the past is our collective cultural heritage.

15:14.133 --> 15:18.477
Is there a golden age of archaeology?

15:18.537 --> 15:19.618
No, there's a golden age.

15:19.718 --> 15:20.219
Not really?

15:20.479 --> 15:20.699
Yes.

15:21.260 --> 15:25.163
Now, if you talk about a golden age of archaeology... I'm always looking for my lead, you see.

15:25.203 --> 15:26.544
I think you just gave me my lead.

15:27.605 --> 15:28.586
No, let me explain.

15:28.606 --> 15:35.733
The golden, the heroic age of archaeological discovery was about 1840 to 1920.

15:35.973 --> 15:41.338
It culminated in the discovery of the tomb of Tut and Carmen and the discovery of the wall graves at Ur.

15:42.061 --> 15:49.650
The golden age of what we know about the past, what we are now capable of finding out about it, is now.

15:50.350 --> 15:57.238
And the potential of what archaeology can do if the past is not destroyed and looted is stagnant.

15:57.258 --> 16:05.908
And when you can tell that people are left-handed or identify beetles which occupied houses and things like that, you really...

16:06.412 --> 16:09.644
are achieving something scientifically.

16:09.784 --> 16:11.510
Explain the Beatles now.

16:11.530 --> 16:14.481
There's a case of a site in England where

16:14.697 --> 16:25.590
They had a mysterious platform in the middle of a swamp, and they established there were no houses on it simply by finding that there were no beetles there which are the sort that feed on domestic garbage.

16:26.671 --> 16:27.632
It's the sort of thing they're doing now.

16:28.834 --> 16:34.000
How about, you mentioned garbage, how about the examination of dumps?

16:34.440 --> 16:41.869
There's a man in Arizona, Bill Raffi, he's either in the book or we took it out because of space.

16:42.136 --> 16:46.072
who has devoted his career to studying modern urban garbage.

16:46.132 --> 16:51.876
And he's looking at, on the one hand, things like resource management, waste management,

16:52.261 --> 16:56.166
what cat foods, different people and different incomes, pets eat, and so on.

16:56.206 --> 17:01.133
Yeah, but now, how would that, of what value would be information like that?

17:01.153 --> 17:07.722
It's a lot, because what you're developing are, it's good marketing information, it's good information for people who deal with waste disposal.

17:07.742 --> 17:10.365
I mean, really, he is consults for a lot of these people.

17:10.846 --> 17:21.981
But it's also priceless to archaeologists, because what you're looking at is the ways in which garbage is formed, garbage is discarded, which may seem bizarre, but remember that we are basically the science of garbage.

17:22.282 --> 17:24.444
We study people's discards.

17:24.464 --> 17:25.605
That's what archaeology is.

17:26.746 --> 17:26.846
Yeah.

17:26.866 --> 17:36.395
And it's a very good way of studying people because you might have, say, an African-American slave community on a sugar plantation in the South who are anonymous.

17:36.455 --> 17:42.281
They were non-literate, and the only surviving evidence of them isn't in the records of the overseers.

17:42.661 --> 17:43.762
It's in their garbage.

17:44.042 --> 17:44.162
Wow.

17:44.963 --> 17:45.764
Bones they have and so on.

17:45.984 --> 17:49.167
And, of course, day in and day out,

17:50.277 --> 18:01.530
the material that you study is the garbage, as you say, but the more spectacular ones are the Tutankhamens, you know, where this material is by no means garbage at all, you know.

18:01.550 --> 18:03.573
So that's funeral offerings.

18:03.593 --> 18:07.277
These are the belongings of the living person sent to accompaniment in the other world.

18:07.618 --> 18:13.244
That is a very different set of variables, like the lords of Seapalm were buried in their full regalia.

18:13.545 --> 18:19.812
From that, you get really precise statements about the ideology of courts,

18:20.146 --> 18:27.456
the great culture, how people, religious beliefs changed, writing, whatever it is, and that is invaluable.

18:27.917 --> 18:46.643
But one of archaeology's most powerful things is it really allows us to study the enormous diversity of, say, 18th century New York or slave plantation or even an early Egyptian town from artifacts, because artifacts ultimately are manufacturers which are as powerful statements as words.

18:46.724 --> 18:56.235
You see, history has always been defined as the recorded, the documentation of human events in words.

18:56.355 --> 19:01.421
You can document them just as much by artifacts as you can by... But apparently that's what's happening now, then.

19:01.441 --> 19:04.104
Yeah, it's a complete redefinition of what history is.

19:04.124 --> 19:05.706
I think so.

19:05.786 --> 19:15.077
Especially when you reflect that huge areas of the world had no written records until Victorian civilization expanded into far parts of the world.

19:15.800 --> 19:19.384
And a lot of the history of Africa, say, is written purely of archaeology.

19:19.424 --> 19:25.309
And archaeology is a unique way of looking at how peoples have changed over enormous periods of time, two and a half million years.

19:25.469 --> 19:30.094
And when we think of it, you know, history goes back to Herodotus and... About a thousand years.

19:30.574 --> 19:33.017
But archaeology as a science is how old?

19:33.898 --> 19:34.999
I suspect about two and a half million.

19:36.200 --> 19:37.822
I mean, as a... As a science?

19:38.402 --> 19:41.685
As a strict science, I would say it's about a hundred years old.

19:42.386 --> 19:45.469
As an amateur pastime, it goes back to medieval times.

19:47.339 --> 19:50.223
I didn't think it went back that far.

19:50.523 --> 19:55.029
What you call it, treasure hunting, antiquarian curiosity, wholesale digging.

19:55.850 --> 19:58.013
I would say it's a product basically of the last 150 years.

19:58.033 --> 20:07.526
And when you say that this is the golden age, how much of this is due to the impact of computers?

20:08.146 --> 20:09.028
Oh, an enormous amount.

20:09.889 --> 20:13.033
It's the impact of high technology science as a whole.

20:14.395 --> 20:16.958
The technique of radiocarbon dating, for example.

20:17.258 --> 20:29.050
the use of computers to marshal and analyze enormous quantities of data, the use of high techniques like spectroscopy.

20:29.931 --> 20:31.393
I'm glad you didn't love me.

20:31.813 --> 20:38.340
Analysis of trace elements in metals and tracing where trade routes, you name it, it's been done.

20:38.360 --> 20:46.168
There were experts on ancient beetles, ancient worms, ancient animal bones, ancient plants, and you can go on, the list is enormous.

20:46.469 --> 20:48.774
all of it the result of science.

20:48.794 --> 20:53.665
But of course in the final analysis you still have to have somebody to interpret all this material.

20:53.685 --> 20:58.977
Ah yes, and one of the important things about this anthology is that you're talking about

20:59.767 --> 21:04.894
the great archaeologist having an instinct for discovery, an instinct of knowing where to dig and where to search.

21:05.434 --> 21:06.716
Let's pursue that just a bit.

21:06.977 --> 21:14.346
How important is instinct, as ineffable as it may be, just out of curiosity?

21:14.366 --> 21:16.970
It is, in my judgment, absolutely vital.

21:17.671 --> 21:27.023
One of the problems with archaeology today is that it's trained enormous numbers of specialists, many of whom are experts on light beetles.

21:27.408 --> 21:32.516
How many of these people are little more than technicians in small world?

21:33.758 --> 21:34.619
Relatively few.

21:35.000 --> 21:50.344
The greatest archaeologists are those who have a broader vision, who can place their work in a broader context, and at the same time have the instinct for discovery, which people like Louis Leakey, Mary Leakey, Austin Henry Layard,

21:51.151 --> 21:52.434
John Lloyd Stevens had.

21:52.875 --> 21:53.997
It's a priceless gift.

21:54.017 --> 21:54.999
And you can't define it.

21:55.380 --> 21:56.201
You can't really define it.

21:56.221 --> 21:59.468
I mean, you can be in the middle of a desert and all of a sudden say, it's here.

21:59.488 --> 22:00.230
There's stuff here.

22:00.931 --> 22:07.745
And when you look at a place, you say, I think I'm going to dig there because in a way you can project yourself into the minds of people who live there.

22:07.765 --> 22:10.330
I don't have the gift myself, but other people do.

22:10.471 --> 22:11.573
It's a very rare gift.

22:11.857 --> 22:14.300
And there are very few truly great archaeologists.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.222
And have you personally seen this in people?

22:16.523 --> 22:16.663
Yes.

22:17.143 --> 22:17.844
Oh, yes.

22:17.864 --> 22:19.246
Can you name me a couple of examples?

22:19.486 --> 22:20.387
You mentioned Leakey.

22:20.688 --> 22:21.168
I'm sorry, who?

22:21.428 --> 22:22.029
Louis Leakey.

22:22.049 --> 22:23.271
Leakey, right.

22:23.291 --> 22:32.241
He was a very difficult, very controversial man, but he had an extraordinary instinct for discovery.

22:32.642 --> 22:35.265
His wife, Mary, was even better than him.

22:35.937 --> 22:36.398
Better.

22:37.079 --> 22:38.280
Oh, she was a better scientist.

22:38.300 --> 22:39.842
She just recently died, didn't she?

22:40.043 --> 22:40.804
I think, yeah.

22:40.884 --> 22:42.907
Yeah, she died about two, six weeks ago.

22:42.927 --> 22:43.487
Yeah, exactly.

22:43.588 --> 22:44.609
Yeah, it was a big piece.

22:44.709 --> 22:46.151
He's one good example.

22:46.952 --> 22:57.346
Another good example is Gordon Willey, W-I-L-L-E-Y, who is the sort of doyen of American archaeologists who worked in the Mayan.

22:57.366 --> 22:59.970
He worked in Peru, and back in the 1940s,

23:00.490 --> 23:09.646
He was one of the first people to go and study a landscape and look at changing settlements using survey techniques, which is something that requires extraordinary instinct to do well.

23:10.708 --> 23:13.352
There were one or two brilliant people.

23:13.372 --> 23:17.039
In a discussion like this, of course, we have to bring up Schliemann at some point.

23:19.883 --> 23:23.089
And perhaps you can assess his...

23:23.508 --> 23:26.691
History has not been kind to Heinrich Schliemann.

23:26.711 --> 23:30.275
Heinrich Schliemann was an old-fashioned entrepreneur.

23:30.295 --> 23:31.576
He went from rags to riches.

23:31.677 --> 23:32.237
He really did.

23:32.277 --> 23:35.861
He was acutely aware of his public image.

23:36.562 --> 23:39.885
He decided to become an archaeologist and nothing would stand in his way.

23:40.205 --> 23:46.752
And he became one absolutely convinced that he could find Homeric Troy and prove that Homer was true.

23:47.353 --> 23:50.376
And if you look at his work with that perspective,

23:50.744 --> 23:54.989
You can understand where he's coming from and his hard-driving business techniques to do it.

23:55.009 --> 24:04.100
I mean, Troy, he employed as some of his supervisors, engineers who'd worked on the digging of the Suez Canal, and he dug on a large scale.

24:05.642 --> 24:12.390
He was not, and history has not been kind to his claims.

24:12.530 --> 24:20.059
I mean, for example, this famous treasure, which has just turned up in Russia, may well have come from all sorts of different levels and not from just one find.

24:20.427 --> 24:25.232
and his famous story of how he found it may in fact have been a fabrication.

24:25.312 --> 24:25.772
We don't know.

24:27.354 --> 24:32.479
He is a man whose veracity is sometimes questionable.

24:33.179 --> 24:39.746
And there have been allegations regarding Carter's discovery of the Tutankhamen tomb as well.

24:40.026 --> 24:40.947
Carter was a good guy.

24:40.987 --> 24:44.170
Carter was a very difficult, very moody man.

24:44.210 --> 24:49.675
He was, within the limitations of his time, an excellent archaeologist, a superb artist.

24:50.431 --> 24:58.341
The controversy over Tutankhamen's tomb, as far as I know, seems to revolve over whether he and Carnarvon actually went into the burial chamber.

24:58.381 --> 24:59.763
The day before, something like that.

24:59.783 --> 25:01.685
I wish they did, there's no question.

25:01.705 --> 25:05.129
And they might have taken a few little things for themselves, I guess.

25:05.149 --> 25:05.310
Oh, yes.

25:05.670 --> 25:06.491
And who wouldn't?

25:06.972 --> 25:11.637
The zone between a collector and an archaeologist is much narrower than today.

25:11.658 --> 25:11.778
Right.

25:11.798 --> 25:14.481
But no one can challenge the extraordinary...

25:14.967 --> 25:17.314
achievement of his clearing of that too.

25:17.355 --> 25:17.956
It's remarkable.

25:18.378 --> 25:26.423
There's a very good book called The Complete Tutankhamen written by a guy called Nicholas Weaves which really explores these issues and there's also a biography of him.

25:26.443 --> 25:27.627
He comes out of it pretty well.

25:27.725 --> 25:28.987
Yeah, good.

25:29.007 --> 25:31.090
I think, sir, we've got plenty of material here.

25:31.951 --> 25:35.576
I'm delighted that you're able to take a little bit of time to talk with me.

25:35.656 --> 25:41.063
And we'll write this thing Thursday, and I'll move it out next week.

25:41.204 --> 25:41.584
Good luck.

25:41.844 --> 25:44.388
And if you have an address, I'd be happy to send you a copy.

25:44.408 --> 25:44.728
Great.

25:44.929 --> 25:50.256
170-HOT-SPRING-ROAD.

25:51.130 --> 25:53.718
Santa Barbara, where the sun shines, 93108.

25:54.099 --> 25:55.825
Excellent.

25:56.046 --> 25:56.507
Good.

25:56.527 --> 25:57.430
Thank you very much, sir.

25:57.691 --> 25:58.172
Have a nice evening.

25:58.192 --> 25:59.416
It's not going to get you so late.

25:59.537 --> 26:00.460
This is not late at all.

26:00.480 --> 26:01.122
I'm still working.

26:01.804 --> 26:02.165
Good night.

26:02.988 --> 26:03.148
Bye-bye.
