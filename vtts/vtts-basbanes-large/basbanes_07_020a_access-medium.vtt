WEBVTT

00:04.064 --> 00:06.346
The tape wasn't running.

00:06.406 --> 00:07.727
We must be half asleep today.

00:07.847 --> 00:09.909
We're starting from scratch.

00:10.530 --> 00:12.091
I'm sorry.

00:12.751 --> 00:13.892
It's good to check everyone.

00:13.993 --> 00:17.856
I saw the red light going and it was bumping, but the tape wasn't moving.

00:17.876 --> 00:18.877
Yeah, it wasn't.

00:20.238 --> 00:23.601
Well, we don't have to cover everything.

00:23.741 --> 00:26.643
I've got a lot of what I told you about myself in there.

00:27.224 --> 00:30.707
I mean, there was a lot of personal stuff that I don't think we have to go over there.

00:30.827 --> 00:33.109
I am very interested in

00:33.865 --> 00:35.107
You said you were in the Peace Corps?

00:35.728 --> 00:36.048
Yes.

00:36.068 --> 00:36.689
In the late 60s.

00:36.869 --> 00:43.679
And the area of Nigeria that became the Afrin seceded for a year after the Civil War began.

00:43.839 --> 00:47.925
I went to Liberia and I was there for a year and a half.

00:47.945 --> 00:50.709
Do you have your biographical background in there?

00:50.729 --> 00:52.091
You said you went to schools again?

00:52.111 --> 00:53.773
University of Redlands.

00:53.833 --> 00:58.059
Graduated from the University of Redlands.

00:58.079 --> 00:58.620
What year was that?

00:58.640 --> 00:58.920
1964.

00:58.940 --> 00:59.461
1964.

00:59.501 --> 01:02.185
You're studying at the United Nations.

01:02.536 --> 01:11.607
program at Drew University in Madison, New Jersey.

01:12.528 --> 01:21.619
Western State, I went to UCLA Law School for two years, and then was out for six years, that was when I was in the Peace Corps, and I finished up at Western State University.

01:25.283 --> 01:31.851
And then just tell me, you've been here in Sacramento, I think you said 16 years, you worked for the

01:32.455 --> 01:35.418
I was a lawyer for the legislature for a couple of years.

01:36.099 --> 01:41.205
I've been an administrative law judge for nine years.

01:41.225 --> 01:50.876
I hear and decide cases involving unemployment matters, disability matters, some tax matters within the lawyers.

01:50.896 --> 01:52.037
So you draw a state salary?

01:52.338 --> 01:52.918
Yes, I do.

01:52.938 --> 01:53.839
A fixed salary.

01:54.180 --> 01:55.101
Right.

01:55.942 --> 02:01.748
Which is interesting to me because your means, regardless of what they are, are not a millionaire's risk.

02:01.769 --> 02:02.209
That's right.

02:02.797 --> 02:11.569
And that is interesting, because every book collector can, anyone can collect satisfactorily at whatever level they're true.

02:11.629 --> 02:12.751
Sure, yeah.

02:12.771 --> 02:24.266
And, you know, with me, it's, it's, I sometimes used to very poor judgment in, in, in, I mean, to digress, it's an emotional experience the first time you spend a hundred dollars for a book.

02:24.827 --> 02:32.297
And it's another kind of experience the first time you spend a thousand dollars for a book, and the first time you spend, you know, significantly more than that.

02:32.547 --> 02:42.287
You keep on upping the ante, and I have found myself making decisions to buy when it really wasn't wise financially, and there's been a real struggle.

02:42.848 --> 02:47.277
Hopefully I don't do that anymore, but I've certainly done it in the past.

02:47.297 --> 02:52.007
You did say that the first collectible, per se, that you bought was after you got out of the Peace Corps.

02:52.763 --> 02:57.928
No, it was Death in the Afternoon Without a Jacket.

02:58.048 --> 02:58.348
Right.

02:59.029 --> 03:00.650
And that kind of began.

03:00.690 --> 03:06.916
Yeah, I learned that there were first editions, that people collected them, and this was a big, beautiful book, you know.

03:07.717 --> 03:12.261
And then I started going to bookstores, used bookstores and rare bookstores and talking.

03:13.162 --> 03:21.049
And in over 23 years, people who have gotten to know about me as a real serious Hemingway collector, I get 250 to 300

03:21.383 --> 03:24.448
catalogs a year from book dealers throughout the country.

03:25.289 --> 03:36.126
And the most wonderful find, which you read about in the New York Times, the way that arose, there was a book dealer in Florida who knew me as a serious Hemingway collector.

03:37.288 --> 03:49.146
And he telephoned me one day, said someone had walked into his shop and handed him, and I'll show you exactly what he was handed right now, and handed him a couple of

03:49.598 --> 03:56.164
typed it in pages and it said that it was a Hemingway short story and that his mother had typed for Hemingway in Cuba in the 30s.

03:56.224 --> 03:56.585
Wow.

03:57.626 --> 04:00.809
And the dealer sent it to me and said, is this really Hemingway?

04:02.030 --> 04:03.131
And what is it?

04:03.531 --> 04:06.214
So he was sending it to you for a consultation as much as anything else.

04:06.234 --> 04:06.815
Yes, right.

04:06.835 --> 04:12.420
What he sent me were Xerox copies of these two pages.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.001
Okay.

04:14.022 --> 04:17.665
And that is the first draft

04:17.797 --> 04:23.442
of the story of the capital of the world, Hemingway did it on his typewriter.

04:23.462 --> 04:31.830
And you know it's his because it has the characteristic spacing before as well as after the commas, and he would do that to slow himself down when he typed.

04:31.850 --> 04:37.436
The way he wrote the story, he did four type pages and 38 manuscript pages.

04:37.456 --> 04:38.817
That's the first draft of the story.

04:39.277 --> 04:47.365
The Kennedy Museum in Boston has the second two type pages and the 38 manuscript pages, and these are the first two type pages.

04:47.564 --> 04:51.267
And their story, what they have, begins right here, where this leaves on.

04:51.287 --> 04:51.668
Really?

04:51.688 --> 05:00.055
In addition, there's a complete carbon type script of the story with ink collections in Hemingway's hand on page four.

05:01.356 --> 05:08.803
And he would count the numbering in pencil on each of the pages is in his hand.

05:09.143 --> 05:13.207
He was notorious for counting his output each day.

05:13.307 --> 05:13.627
That's right.

05:13.647 --> 05:16.930
He wanted to do 600 words minimum a day, something like that.

05:17.703 --> 05:20.066
Anyway, this is what the dealer in Florida sent me.

05:20.086 --> 05:21.828
And I sent him back a letter saying, yes, it is.

05:22.509 --> 05:25.333
And this also is a pencil insert in his hand.

05:26.555 --> 05:28.257
Sure.

05:28.277 --> 05:28.697
Okay.

05:28.718 --> 05:32.002
He was a well-built baby.

05:32.663 --> 05:41.474
He was a well-built boy with very black, rather curly hair, good teeth, and a skin that his sisters envied.

05:41.715 --> 05:44.098
And he had a ready and unpuzzled smile.

05:44.679 --> 05:45.820
He was fast on his feet.

05:46.407 --> 05:47.368
and did his work well.

05:47.569 --> 05:49.331
And it goes in right there.

05:49.592 --> 05:51.234
And it says, insert page one.

05:51.254 --> 05:51.614
Yeah.

05:51.634 --> 05:55.099
And he loved his sisters who seemed beautiful and sophisticated.

05:56.421 --> 05:57.763
And then look at that, look at the comma.

05:57.823 --> 05:59.345
And that's Hemingway.

05:59.465 --> 06:00.727
That's no question.

06:00.747 --> 06:00.988
Oh, yeah.

06:01.008 --> 06:01.168
Right.

06:01.188 --> 06:01.889
That's good prose.

06:01.969 --> 06:04.613
That's not bad, is it?

06:04.633 --> 06:05.955
So what did you think when you saw this?

06:05.975 --> 06:12.464
Well, I was just astounded because, you know, Hemingway typescripts or manuscripts are all in museums.

06:13.285 --> 06:14.727
And the story that this guy...

06:15.297 --> 06:18.962
He walks into the store, and he hands this to the book dealer, and he says, this is a Hemingway.

06:18.982 --> 06:20.864
My mom talked for Hemingway, Cuba.

06:20.945 --> 06:23.628
So I wrote the dealer a letter, and I said, is there more?

06:23.909 --> 06:24.369
Yes, it is.

06:24.449 --> 06:25.130
It's the real thing.

06:25.170 --> 06:26.272
I told him what story it was.

06:26.712 --> 06:27.914
Is there more, and is it for sale?

06:28.695 --> 06:32.059
Actually, before I got the letter, I phoned him.

06:32.119 --> 06:32.700
I couldn't wait.

06:33.962 --> 06:43.915
And so then he told me what he knew about it, and he told me a price that he thought that it could be had for, because they talked about a price, because the guy wanted his son.

06:43.935 --> 06:45.237
What was the price?

06:47.242 --> 06:48.804
Well, the price was $10,000.

06:48.844 --> 06:50.646
That's not bad.

06:50.886 --> 06:52.288
No, it wasn't.

06:53.429 --> 06:57.273
But what I did is offer that, and there was no deal.

06:59.075 --> 07:01.057
But you got another dealer involved, unfortunately.

07:01.077 --> 07:05.222
Well, no, I didn't mind the dealer being involved, because I was then a collector, really.

07:07.464 --> 07:07.985
When was this?

07:08.065 --> 07:09.286
Did we say what year this was?

07:09.307 --> 07:10.628
Yeah, this was about three years ago.

07:11.068 --> 07:12.971
Okay, 1987, we'll say.

07:13.311 --> 07:13.591
Yes.

07:14.913 --> 07:15.173
Okay.

07:15.811 --> 07:18.975
Actually, I was a dealer, but he knew me as a collector.

07:19.055 --> 07:21.838
You know, I was just barely beginning in the business.

07:23.921 --> 07:25.964
So a process began then.

07:25.984 --> 07:32.712
The book dealer dealing with the owner of this material and myself in California.

07:33.273 --> 07:34.915
And I kept on asking, is there more?

07:34.935 --> 07:38.359
And it turned out there were six inscribed magazine appearances.

07:38.599 --> 07:43.405
This typescript and some wonderful photographs and a few other...

07:44.060 --> 07:52.769
things, but primarily the six inscribed, oh, a letter, a book by Martha Gelman, or a certain Y, which was inscribed.

07:55.472 --> 07:58.395
Well, we're going to talk about just whatever you're feeling.

07:58.916 --> 08:01.419
Yeah.

08:01.439 --> 08:11.529
For Phyllis Armstrong, who did most of the work with gratitude and affection, Martha Gelman, San Francisco de Paul, that's the Finca in Cuba, where, of course, Martha lived for just four years.

08:11.930 --> 08:12.891
Yeah.

08:13.371 --> 08:13.932
Mary lived

08:14.266 --> 08:21.977
Most of the time there, but... Anyway, the novel... This is A Stricken Field, a novel of today by Martha Gellhorn.

08:22.157 --> 08:23.259
Right.

08:23.279 --> 08:23.859
Okay.

08:23.879 --> 08:25.121
For the sake of the tape, yeah.

08:25.181 --> 08:25.442
Right.

08:25.462 --> 08:28.986
And this is one of the inscribed magazine appearances.

08:29.006 --> 08:30.148
Oh, that's kind of nice.

08:30.168 --> 08:32.351
This is The Spanish War by Ernest Hemingway.

08:32.531 --> 08:32.912
Right.

08:32.932 --> 08:37.318
It's to Jane Armstrong, best always Ernest Hemingway, and that signature is... Right.

08:37.438 --> 08:38.740
Absolutely.

08:39.721 --> 08:41.324
It's like looking at... Right.

08:41.864 --> 08:42.025
Right.

08:42.545 --> 08:43.767
Just to give you a real...

08:44.236 --> 08:47.639
Jane Armstrong married to Richard Armstrong.

08:48.240 --> 08:51.723
Richard Armstrong was head of the International News Service in Havana, Cuba in the 30s.

08:52.424 --> 08:54.706
Jane was his wife.

08:55.186 --> 08:56.147
She worked for the U.S.

08:56.207 --> 08:57.488
Consulate.

08:57.508 --> 08:59.630
Their daughter was Phyllis.

08:59.650 --> 09:06.076
Jane typed Green Hills of Africa, and this is the typescript for Green Hills of Africa.

09:06.096 --> 09:09.439
Phyllis typed, for whom the bell tolls.

09:09.459 --> 09:11.121
Now, I have here...

09:12.181 --> 09:13.883
This is all from the same collection?

09:14.063 --> 09:17.228
Yeah, all of this stuff virtually is from the same collection.

09:17.248 --> 09:17.788
Wow.

09:17.808 --> 09:19.270
But I got it from different places.

09:19.370 --> 09:24.417
See, I got some from the grandson of Jane, the son of Phyllis, and some later I'll get to the story.

09:24.457 --> 09:26.079
How were you beating out everybody else?

09:26.860 --> 09:30.184
How did you have an exclusive... Okay, let me just go on with the story.

09:30.204 --> 09:34.410
Okay, but this is... I'm curious to know why the JFK... It's a wonderful story involved in this.

09:34.550 --> 09:34.910
Right.

09:34.930 --> 09:35.611
How come they weren't?

09:36.332 --> 09:36.973
Right.

09:37.375 --> 09:38.577
bidding for this.

09:38.797 --> 09:39.839
Okay.

09:40.259 --> 09:41.802
We're going to finish your story and we'll get to that.

09:41.822 --> 09:43.104
Yeah.

09:43.344 --> 09:46.469
So I kept on asking, is there more?

09:46.569 --> 09:52.798
And finally, he made a list of what he had and sent it to the book dealer.

09:54.180 --> 09:58.767
And so then I made an offer for the whole thing.

09:59.007 --> 09:59.648
To the dealer?

09:59.829 --> 10:00.870
To the dealer.

10:00.910 --> 10:01.832
But I said, it's all or nothing.

10:02.012 --> 10:04.075
I don't want to negotiate individual prices.

10:04.493 --> 10:16.503
There were also a bunch of magazine clippings and news clippings from the 30s and 40s, you know, which were itemized individually, but of course didn't have any value, comparatively speaking.

10:16.523 --> 10:21.487
But in any case, I did make an offer of the whole thing because I didn't want to, you know, have to negotiate.

10:22.668 --> 10:24.070
In any case, he said yes.

10:24.930 --> 10:28.733
And so I flew back to Florida.

10:28.754 --> 10:34.078
And the book dealer and I drove 100 miles to this small Florida seacoast town.

10:34.700 --> 10:40.328
and went into this man's house and purchased this wonderful material.

10:40.348 --> 10:41.150
Let me show you.

10:41.530 --> 10:44.174
Can you tell me who the dealer is, or is that something you'd rather not say?

10:44.535 --> 10:48.020
Oh, I'd just soon not say, but I will, because he's a good friend.

10:48.441 --> 10:49.142
Well, he didn't do anything.

10:50.063 --> 10:50.524
No, no.

10:50.684 --> 10:53.148
It's Michael Slicker of Lighthouse Books in Florida.

10:53.188 --> 10:54.109
He's a good friend.

10:54.207 --> 11:00.854
And he's the best, most prominent book dealer in Florida, so it would be easy to find out.

11:01.034 --> 11:01.775
Well, I could follow him.

11:01.795 --> 11:01.955
Yeah.

11:02.236 --> 11:03.197
Oh, yeah.

11:03.357 --> 11:04.638
There's really no reason not to.

11:04.658 --> 11:06.661
I mean, there's nothing that's improper, so.

11:06.841 --> 11:07.101
No.

11:07.602 --> 11:12.247
The only thing is, if he gets Hemingway's stuff, I want him to offer it to me.

11:13.028 --> 11:13.568
You know what I mean?

11:14.129 --> 11:21.717
The point is, I'm getting this information with the idea of publishing it, so it's, you know, I mean, you're going to be interested.

11:22.017 --> 11:26.142
Introduced to a reading public here.

11:26.683 --> 11:32.090
This is perhaps one of the other wonderful things from this collection.

11:32.110 --> 11:39.719
Cosmopolitan, the story Nobody Ever Dies, was not republished in book form until the complete stories for Ernest Hemingway in 1987.

11:40.420 --> 11:41.642
What Cosmopolitan is that?

11:41.822 --> 11:43.464
It's March of 1939.

11:43.644 --> 11:46.088
I'll be looking for it.

11:46.108 --> 11:47.369
Yes, yes.

11:47.389 --> 11:51.214
But in the first three or four paragraphs, the portraits are...

11:51.532 --> 11:57.469
the porch or upper porch, from which you can see the Havana Harbor, is mentioned in the text.

11:57.489 --> 12:03.527
And the inscription is, Dear Jane, thanks for the loan of your upper porch for this story, Ernest Hemingway.

12:03.547 --> 12:05.372
This all came from that collection?

12:05.572 --> 12:31.377
yeah this is from the dot see this interesting just to tell me a little bit about who the source is to lighthouse because i don't think you've told me yeah well who this person is and how this all this material happened to be in the possession of the person obviously nobody knew anything about obviously we're going to get through all that yeah um phyllis armstrong was the daughter of jane and jane armstrong the stepdaughter of richard armstrong um and

12:32.048 --> 12:43.498
Richard really was the collector of the family, I understand from, I've talked to both Jane, no, Jane's dad, I've talked to Phyllis, who's now in her 60s, at the time she was 17 when she talked from the bell tolls.

12:44.419 --> 12:49.164
The stuff basically resided in her closet for 50 years.

12:50.004 --> 12:52.607
She moved from Washington, D.C.

12:52.707 --> 13:01.515
to North Carolina in 87, and her son came up from Florida to help him move, and they came across this stuff, and the son

13:01.715 --> 13:05.419
you know, talks Mom out of some of it.

13:05.439 --> 13:09.863
He then goes back to Florida and walks into the book dealer's shop.

13:11.104 --> 13:19.773
The long process of two and a half months, three months, culminates in my getting some of the stuff, not the greatest stuff, but some of the stuff from the son.

13:21.014 --> 13:25.678
And when I'm in Florida, from the son's house, I call Phyllis on the phone.

13:27.120 --> 13:30.683
She's in North Carolina by now, or I don't know whether she moved from Washington, D.C.

13:30.843 --> 13:31.384
to North Carolina.

13:31.735 --> 14:00.493
by then, but in any case, every time I talked to her, I asked her if there was any more, you know, any Christmas cards or anything, and she never said there was, but when I got back to California with these six inscribed articles and a short story, I wrote her a long letter, you know, acknowledging what wonderful material it was, and again, asking if there was any more, and I didn't, this was, it would have been probably December of 87,

14:02.144 --> 14:06.108
And I got a letter six months later in June.

14:06.188 --> 14:07.590
Six months.

14:07.610 --> 14:11.674
And she said, basically it was, he has to do that some more and I'll give it to my daughter.

14:13.036 --> 14:16.219
And it turns out the daughter and the son don't speak.

14:16.239 --> 14:19.482
They live in the same small boy town and they don't speak.

14:20.163 --> 14:28.472
So I then phoned Phyllis and asked if it would be appropriate for me to contact the daughter directly.

14:28.688 --> 14:29.269
Well, yes.

14:29.289 --> 14:38.983
By implication, I think the daughter learned that the son got a lot of money for the stuff, and Mom had given the rest of the stuff to the daughter, so... A lot of money from you.

14:39.044 --> 14:47.516
A lot of money from me to the son, and so the daughter learned that what she had was very valuable, and, you know, let's contact Mr. Neekin, so Phyllis wrote the letters to me.

14:47.536 --> 14:49.039
Is this a figure you carry as well?

14:50.561 --> 14:56.229
Well, I have right around six figures in everything I purchase in my family.

14:56.249 --> 14:56.670
All right, thank you.

14:57.308 --> 14:58.469
are a little less.

14:58.569 --> 14:59.730
Do you have to borrow money for this?

14:59.971 --> 15:00.571
Yes.

15:00.591 --> 15:01.192
Refinance.

15:04.435 --> 15:05.656
That's a way.

15:05.676 --> 15:07.638
Well, it's a good investment.

15:07.738 --> 15:16.807
Well, it's the most wonderful, it's certainly the most wonderful and significant anyway find, you know, that I know of in my life.

15:16.827 --> 15:18.309
One place like this.

15:18.329 --> 15:19.951
See, you log as Jehosh?

15:21.332 --> 15:22.593
I'm log as another building.

15:22.673 --> 15:25.476
It's a big lesson.

15:28.409 --> 15:29.590
Is that right?

15:29.610 --> 15:33.595
Well, yeah, because basically, you know, this to me is the passion.

15:33.695 --> 15:35.537
I mean, what's going through your mind?

15:35.557 --> 15:36.739
Why do you have to have this stuff?

15:36.779 --> 15:41.484
Well, you know, I realized, especially when I, oh, let me tell you one other thing.

15:41.584 --> 15:42.705
I'll answer your question.

15:42.725 --> 15:52.296
So I'm talking to Phyllis on the phone, and I just sort of parenthetically say, by the way, where was that short story, time script, all these years?

15:52.817 --> 15:57.302
And she said, well, it was stuck between the pages of the time script of Green Hills of Africa.

15:59.628 --> 16:02.051
You know, my heart hit.

16:02.892 --> 16:05.816
And I said, do you have the tidescript to Greenville's Act?

16:05.836 --> 16:06.237
He said, yes.

16:06.998 --> 16:09.762
I've given that to my daughter.

16:09.782 --> 16:18.213
And so then the daughter had all this material.

16:18.674 --> 16:19.515
And I phoned her.

16:19.555 --> 16:24.642
And she said, why don't you come over, I haven't gone through it yet.

16:24.662 --> 16:26.024
Why don't you come down and we'll go through it.

16:26.384 --> 16:27.846
And I really didn't want to have that much

16:28.231 --> 16:31.736
financial and emotional investment, unless I was going to be able to buy it.

16:31.756 --> 16:39.708
So I said, you go through it, list what's there, and send me the list, and I'll make you an offer, or we'll talk about it after you know what it is.

16:39.748 --> 16:43.694
So it took her about two or three months to do that, and a couple other phone calls.

16:44.856 --> 16:53.449
And then eventually, I made an offer, and it was very, very low in her eyes.

16:54.370 --> 16:55.572
And I think she had

16:56.058 --> 17:06.607
basically arrived at a figure that would dramatically change her lifestyle and didn't have much other, you know, relation to reality.

17:06.687 --> 17:15.155
But for eight months then, I was talking with a dealer who was talking to her, and she never did say that she'd sell it.

17:15.375 --> 17:25.204
She started talking about, she apparently had a number of children, and then 12 years later had another child, and the youngest child was

17:25.522 --> 17:27.584
an infant at the time.

17:27.864 --> 17:30.607
How did she get the typescript of Nehru?

17:30.887 --> 17:36.353
Her mom gives some to the son and the balance to the daughter.

17:36.373 --> 17:42.059
And I got 25 letters from Martha Gellhorn, 9 letters from Ernest, typescript for Greenhouse of Africa.

17:42.179 --> 17:43.460
Wonderful, wonderful letters.

17:43.720 --> 17:55.292
All about his, and I'll show them to you, all about his creative process, writing Greenhouse of Africa, writing to Have and Have Not, and some other stuff too, which I'll show you in a few minutes.

17:55.576 --> 18:03.645
Jane, you'll see from some of the letters, just to give you an idea.

18:04.266 --> 18:13.376
They were real close friends, and you can tell that by reading the letters from Ernest.

18:14.016 --> 18:17.360
Okay, this is all concerned with Green Hills of Africa.

18:21.084 --> 18:23.266
Which this is, by the way.

18:23.286 --> 18:24.688
Is this for sale, too, by the way?

18:26.035 --> 18:49.900
yeah yeah okay but it says by ernest hemingway key west florida u.s first serial rights only yeah um that is an old paper i i'll choose not to touch right the the first is a little rough and the last couple are rough but otherwise it's it's a wonderful condition yeah it is and this is obviously the box that probably you know the box

18:50.555 --> 18:51.115
I would say.

18:51.216 --> 18:52.597
In Spanish, you probably bought it.

18:52.797 --> 18:56.240
In Blanco, B-L-A-N-C-O.

18:56.360 --> 18:58.101
Makina de Esco by typing paper.

18:58.802 --> 19:00.403
Let me write that down.

19:00.443 --> 19:00.744
Yeah.

19:02.205 --> 19:03.366
Okay, we're back on here.

19:03.386 --> 19:06.809
Before I purchased, I wanted to verify what it was.

19:07.629 --> 19:13.574
So I wrote to Kennedy, who has another typescript of Green Hills of Africa.

19:13.655 --> 19:15.096
Explain what Kennedy is.

19:15.136 --> 19:15.216
JFK.

19:15.236 --> 19:20.140
JFK Library in Boston, Massachusetts, who has the Hemingway

19:20.474 --> 19:27.381
The conversation between Mary and Jackie Kennedy is how that happens.

19:27.921 --> 19:32.126
That's not famous, but it's nice.

19:34.568 --> 19:42.977
On January 4, 1935, Jane Armstrong had basically finished typing Green Hills of Africa in Fort Reynolds.

19:43.017 --> 19:45.159
Here's a letter that she writes.

19:46.120 --> 19:50.464
He apparently was vacationing in Arkansas.

19:50.900 --> 20:02.259
And she didn't want to send a manuscript with Harrington, who was the captain of the boat that went between Havana and Key West, because she was afraid that he might not be there.

20:02.500 --> 20:03.301
You want to read the letter?

20:03.682 --> 20:04.663
Yeah, well, I just love this.

20:04.743 --> 20:12.356
It's Habana, H-A-B-A-N-A dash, January 4th, numeral 4th, T-H, just before mail time.

20:12.637 --> 20:12.837
Right.

20:13.378 --> 20:16.283
Dear Ernest, you are far too charitable,

20:17.309 --> 20:19.334
About my solitary talent.

20:19.534 --> 20:21.259
About my solitary talent, Gash.

20:21.840 --> 20:24.947
And besides, it's languished beneath a bushel.

20:25.569 --> 20:33.608
Or have I got that next during the holidays, which snuck up like, snuck is best called, like fees in the night or something.

20:33.628 --> 20:35.132
The thing is, I'm overwhelmed.

20:35.804 --> 20:38.708
with remorse at visions of your... Maybe you can read it better.

20:38.768 --> 20:39.088
Okay.

20:39.349 --> 20:49.663
The thing is, I'm overwhelmed with remorse at visions of your face peering hopefully up at the bridge of the Cuba tomorrow, that's the name of the boat, when there isn't going to be any manuscript aboard.

20:50.003 --> 20:55.551
But then maybe you aren't back from Arkansas yet anyway, and it might get lost if you didn't claim it in person.

20:56.492 --> 21:04.022
I took you literally about it being a rough copy, and as I've galloped along, Rick has trailed me with a pencil picking up lapses.

21:04.340 --> 21:28.356
in a few instances that's her husband richard a few instances i've left wide open spaces to fill in a word it will be largely done for the boat on wednesday the ninth and the remainder to go forward at earliest possible moment which maybe i can write a more coherent note the dos passos are here to go over to the isle of pines tonight and later on down in the british west indies and this morning rick

21:28.876 --> 21:38.446
had a cordial note from Miss Kaldewaler, C-A-D-A-W-A-L-L-A-D-A-R, with the Tarplin book of Demox he'd long wanted.

21:38.466 --> 21:48.097
Unless you hear otherwise by cable, then most of the manuscript, with copy and carbon, will be confided to Captain H next Wednesday morning.

21:48.597 --> 21:56.706
Now, the manuscript and the two typescripts, one of them is in the...

21:57.682 --> 22:02.107
The Kennedy Museum in Boston.

22:03.188 --> 22:05.190
About approximately 260 pages.

22:05.430 --> 22:10.376
The missing 80 pages from that draft is with the University of Delaware Library.

22:11.777 --> 22:15.801
Now the only one with corrections in Hemingway's hand is the portion of the one at Boston.

22:16.382 --> 22:26.693
I got Xerox copies of what the Kennedy had and what the University of Delaware had before I finalized this because

22:26.960 --> 22:30.305
I wanted to make sure it was what it was.

22:31.747 --> 22:35.994
And she uses two different typefaces, and they're precisely the same.

22:36.114 --> 22:39.379
So there's this—this is nine-point type.

22:39.779 --> 22:42.664
I just saw something penciled in derriere in green ink.

22:43.204 --> 22:43.485
Yes.

22:44.106 --> 22:45.548
She said that she left some blanks.

22:45.568 --> 22:48.192
Blanks and so—that's not in Ernest's hand, though.

22:48.212 --> 22:49.294
No, it's not in Ernest's hand.

22:49.354 --> 22:51.998
I don't know whose hand that is.

22:52.078 --> 22:54.942
And there are only two or three in the whole thing.

22:55.208 --> 22:56.990
He made corrections on the other one.

22:57.210 --> 23:05.839
But basically, this letter establishes that her intention was to mail the handwritten manuscript and the two type copies back to him.

23:06.100 --> 23:07.541
Do you know what year this is going on?

23:07.561 --> 23:08.182
Yes, this is 35.

23:08.342 --> 23:08.482
Okay.

23:08.722 --> 23:09.323
Okay.

23:09.423 --> 23:10.945
Because it doesn't get the year.

23:10.965 --> 23:11.185
Right.

23:11.345 --> 23:13.027
And let me show you these other letters.

23:13.087 --> 23:13.367
Okay.

23:13.948 --> 23:18.853
So then he gets this letter, and then he sends her this telegram.

23:20.825 --> 23:23.407
Arrived yesterday meeting Harrington.

23:23.608 --> 23:26.210
That's the captain of the voltage goes back and forth.

23:26.350 --> 23:27.591
Meeting Harrington Saturday.

23:27.712 --> 23:28.793
Gratefulest, Ernest.

23:28.853 --> 23:31.495
This is January 10th, 1935.

23:32.176 --> 23:33.317
Western Union Cable.

23:33.577 --> 23:34.438
Right up.

23:34.458 --> 23:35.279
Okay.

23:35.299 --> 23:40.323
Now we've got this one.

23:40.343 --> 23:41.585
Dear Ernest.

23:41.605 --> 23:42.706
This is January 11th.

23:42.766 --> 23:43.527
Havana.

23:43.787 --> 23:44.808
She gets a telegram.

23:45.248 --> 23:46.109
She's shipping the stuff.

23:46.489 --> 23:47.710
Dear Ernest.

23:47.730 --> 23:48.271
Here it is.

23:48.571 --> 23:50.393
And however inadequate typing,

23:51.014 --> 23:55.521
And you'll notice the typeface is the same as that used in... This is important.

23:55.761 --> 23:57.283
Why do you keep pointing this out?

23:57.364 --> 23:58.145
I know why.

23:58.165 --> 24:02.832
Okay, this is nine-point type, and it's the typewriter she had at the U.S.

24:02.912 --> 24:04.154
Embassy where she worked.

24:04.875 --> 24:08.661
And also, there's elite type used in this.

24:09.582 --> 24:18.996
And at the Kennedy, what they have, of course, was done... The pages where she would change to the elite type are the same.

24:19.162 --> 24:23.608
And that's what I wanted to confirm, that this really was exactly what it was supposed to be.

24:23.648 --> 24:27.234
There's no chance that any of this could be forgeries or anything.

24:27.394 --> 24:27.654
No.

24:28.015 --> 24:30.358
Have you had any chemical stuff done on the paper?

24:30.458 --> 24:30.698
No.

24:31.099 --> 24:38.169
But, you know, looking at, I've seen what the Kennedy has, and, you know, it's just, they're both the same draft.

24:38.269 --> 24:39.631
And the provenance is excellent.

24:39.651 --> 24:40.112
Oh, yeah.

24:40.132 --> 24:40.452
Right.

24:40.893 --> 24:42.916
So here's this letter, which he actually sent it to him.

24:42.956 --> 24:43.437
Here it is.

24:43.517 --> 24:47.903
And however inadequate it typed in, when I could, I worked on my machine at the office,

24:48.203 --> 24:52.088
And for the rest of it, use this old mill, which you know so well.

24:52.468 --> 24:55.332
Now, I guess this is the one she had at home, the nine-point type.

24:55.352 --> 24:57.675
Like hunting greater kudu with a popcorn.

24:58.156 --> 25:06.026
It was a great experience watching it unfold, the vibrant Africa I knew it must be, the country you're homesick for, though you've never seen it.

25:06.486 --> 25:09.370
Not glamorous, not romantic, but so much better than that.

25:10.091 --> 25:10.431
That's excellent.

25:10.451 --> 25:15.578
The engaging personalities moving in their own rhythms, standing out in their full stature,

25:15.946 --> 25:22.516
stature and integrity of their own background, not thrown in as props to hold glory-reflecting mirrors.

25:23.477 --> 25:25.260
You forgot remarks, Rick, at this point.

25:25.681 --> 25:28.144
It wasn't Halliburton writing the story.

25:29.326 --> 25:43.708
The introspective digressions, too, are well included, particularly that one magnificent passage of the Gulf Stream soliloquy, all developed with that deceptive simplicity so devilish to achieve which has confounded even your better imitators.

25:44.195 --> 25:46.979
The things you changed your mind about are illuminating too.

25:47.580 --> 25:49.142
It's grand to have seen it in the making.

25:49.602 --> 25:58.555
Some of the construction and hyphenation left me in somewhat of a quandary because I haven't forgotten that crack you made about my having copied even your mistakes.

25:59.156 --> 26:01.439
But who am I to say when they are?

26:01.739 --> 26:09.510
If, as you suggested, you find your way clear to send the manuscript back, I'll be inexpressibly delighted to have it.

26:09.845 --> 26:16.753
but I'm not interested in knowing who might be able to dispose of it, just how many libraries have a Hemingway holograph.

26:16.773 --> 26:19.296
Best to you all from both of us.

26:19.316 --> 26:19.857
All right.

26:19.877 --> 26:21.038
These are Carvins, of course.

26:21.158 --> 26:25.964
Yeah, she kept Carvins of her own, and then she... That was dated Havana, January 11th.

26:26.144 --> 26:26.424
Right.

26:26.945 --> 26:28.206
And then here's his response.

26:28.246 --> 26:29.228
This is the letter.

26:29.848 --> 26:35.855
February 5th, 1935, Box 406, Key West, and pencil in Hemingway's hand.

26:36.356 --> 26:38.198
And then he typed the letter, Dear Dick and Jane.

26:38.667 --> 26:53.703
I haven't written to thank Jane for the swell typing, for the swell typing job, because I've been waiting until I can send the, i.e., the holograph.

26:54.143 --> 26:55.445
Apparently he's just learning this word.

26:55.885 --> 27:03.213
Think of old Ham having written holographs all these years and not knowing it.

27:03.233 --> 27:07.037
As soon as I definitely get it pared down and in Scribner's hands,

27:07.642 --> 27:09.324
We'll send it over by Harrington.

27:10.085 --> 27:16.573
It was a beautiful job of figuring out what the hell my holograph meant, and I appreciate it very much.

27:17.233 --> 27:23.181
Max Perkins and Dos, that's John Dos Passos, of course, who have read it, like it very much.

27:24.162 --> 27:25.403
No one had seen it at this time.

27:25.503 --> 27:31.571
Jane and Perkins and Dos Passos, his own ones who read it by February 5th of 35.

27:32.372 --> 27:36.957
Dos like it very much, have read it, like it very much, and I'm beginning to feel better about it.

27:37.088 --> 27:46.520
I was so damn pleased that you both liked it, but was afraid maybe Jane liked it because she likes Africa, and that Vic liked it because he likes or liked to drink.

27:47.141 --> 27:53.328
I have cut considerable garden manure and night soil out of it, but have left in the Gulf Stream as you requested.

27:53.869 --> 27:55.251
Question without having to read the whole thing.

27:55.271 --> 27:56.492
Yes, I'm not going to read it anymore.

27:56.512 --> 27:56.612
Okay.

27:57.233 --> 27:59.696
Any chance of getting a zero-art for this?

27:59.716 --> 28:00.638
No, I don't want to do that.

28:00.658 --> 28:01.138
Okay.

28:01.158 --> 28:05.003
But basically that's what deals with Green Hills of Africa, that portion.

28:05.422 --> 28:18.055
And, you know, she, in her letter, said, leave in the stuff about the Gulf Stream, so he quite magnanimously, and maybe incorrectly, but just as a compliment there, says, I left in the stuff about the Gulf Stream as you requested.

28:18.296 --> 28:19.016
As you requested.

28:19.216 --> 28:20.378
Right.

28:20.398 --> 28:20.538
Yeah.

28:20.558 --> 28:20.858
That's great.

28:20.898 --> 28:21.499
How did he sign it?

28:22.900 --> 28:23.821
Ernest.

28:23.841 --> 28:26.004
And you're welcome to read it, you know, later.

28:26.164 --> 28:26.804
Okay.

28:26.844 --> 28:30.228
Regards to... Manuolo.

28:30.408 --> 28:31.790
Yeah.

28:31.810 --> 28:33.171
And then there's some pencil.

28:33.331 --> 28:33.932
Right.

28:34.032 --> 28:34.973
Later in the letter...

28:35.324 --> 28:54.423
He asks Richard to, this is also significant because it's another literary thing, he asks Richard to get Carlos Guterres, who was the mate on the Pilar, to get some baits and tie some baits because he has to do this big snot of a book for Derrido Press.

28:56.184 --> 29:01.710
So obviously that occurred, and Richard, who was a photojournalist, he wanted him to take pictures.

29:03.271 --> 29:04.032
So here we have it.

29:04.518 --> 29:17.770
That paragraph led to Richard Armstrong getting Carlos Gutierrez and trying to Bates, just as Ernest directs in that letter.

29:21.713 --> 29:26.137
And I'll show you those very pictures that that paragraph was the instigation for.

29:26.198 --> 29:28.640
Right here.

29:28.660 --> 29:30.802
And this is Carlos Gutierrez, his mate on the phone.

29:30.822 --> 29:32.023
Carlos is going to spell it.

29:32.043 --> 29:34.525
It's Carlos G-U-T.

29:35.787 --> 29:38.731
I-E, I-E, R-R-E-Z.

29:39.071 --> 29:39.952
R-R-E-Z.

29:40.493 --> 29:56.653
And he specifically tells him to have him, you know, tie the bait, the mackerel a certain way, and it's just fascinating, you know, that... So he's got 12 pictures of his bait.

29:58.455 --> 30:04.022
I love that the letter has all of Hemingway's legendary idiosyncrasies with typing.

30:04.306 --> 30:09.452
The raised letters, you know how it says letters are famous, but I'm going to put my pen down there.

30:10.654 --> 30:10.894
Sure.

30:10.914 --> 30:12.836
I saw a couple of raised letters.

30:12.856 --> 30:14.438
It just looks like a Hemingway letter.

30:14.458 --> 30:14.739
Right.

30:14.819 --> 30:16.801
It's better now become very famous because he's even.

30:17.021 --> 30:17.983
Oh, yeah.

30:18.043 --> 30:23.569
Is this the cornerstone of the... Well, this, I've got nine other letters.

30:23.890 --> 30:26.573
Okay, but the significance of that for you is what?

30:26.974 --> 30:28.395
Oh, this whole thing.

30:28.516 --> 30:32.220
Well, you know, the letters, the carbons from Jane and the ones,

30:32.538 --> 30:44.428
They sort of legitimized her possessing the manuscript, because she says, I'm going to send you the manuscript and the two, you know, the carbon and the original.

30:44.789 --> 30:52.776
So she sends them to him, presumably, and then he sends back to her the original manuscript, the handwritten manuscript, and this, okay?

30:53.516 --> 30:59.201
And he makes his changes on the copy that he then sends to Max Perkins and Scribner's.

30:59.682 --> 31:01.363
Later, in 1947,

31:02.255 --> 31:13.671
Phyllis, the daughter, who was hard up at the time, sold the handwritten manuscript through Scribner's to the University of Virginia Library, and that's where it is now.

31:15.173 --> 31:18.077
But this stuff all... Well, it validates everything.

31:18.097 --> 31:18.878
Yeah, right, exactly.

31:19.199 --> 31:21.102
It's documentation, shall we say.

31:21.122 --> 31:21.843
Right, yeah.

31:21.883 --> 31:23.044
It validates everything else.

31:23.425 --> 31:24.306
Right.

31:24.406 --> 31:28.532
It basically legitimizes the provenance.

31:30.588 --> 31:31.429
Okay.

31:31.449 --> 31:32.350
Okay, that's great.

31:32.931 --> 31:42.445
Would you say that the Times claimed that you have the finest collection of Hemingway manuscript material in private hands, is that correct?

31:42.465 --> 31:51.337
Well, I don't know of any other Hemingway novels, non-fiction novels, any typescripts in a private collection.

31:51.357 --> 31:51.978
I don't know of any.

31:51.998 --> 31:57.546
There may be some, but I don't know of any, and no collector I've talked to knows of any.

31:57.566 --> 32:00.510
All of the Hemingway manuscripts, the University of Texas has some,

32:00.997 --> 32:05.242
Virginia has some, the Kennedy has a number, but I don't know of any in private hands.

32:06.163 --> 32:10.369
And the number of short stories in private hands are very, very few.

32:10.389 --> 32:12.311
There are some, but look at that.

32:12.331 --> 32:12.792
Did you read that?

32:12.812 --> 32:13.593
I had the case made.

32:13.993 --> 32:16.096
It's very beautiful.

32:16.256 --> 32:17.518
Can you describe it for us?

32:18.299 --> 32:22.984
Describe it for the... Yeah, the case is a slip case with a cover.

32:25.367 --> 32:28.371
The story, the capital of the world, the story is about...

32:29.093 --> 32:32.699
A guy who works in a restaurant, a waiter, who wants to be a bullfighter.

32:33.441 --> 32:37.548
And so he picks up a chair and ties a sword to it.

32:37.948 --> 32:43.438
And eventually, in trying to get this other guy who's working with him, he gets stabbed.

32:43.458 --> 32:44.460
That's the plot of the story.

32:44.961 --> 32:54.477
So in some kind of brass welding, soldering, someone has drawn a chair with a sword tied to it.

32:55.216 --> 33:06.610
and then a facsimile awareness having a signature on the front of the box that I had made for.

33:06.691 --> 33:13.179
Prior to the acquisition of this, we could say that you had an excellent collection of first editions.

33:13.199 --> 33:18.085
Yeah, a wonderful collection of first editions, some letters, but nothing like this.

33:18.125 --> 33:24.413
You were what could be regarded as a possessor of a really fine,

33:24.882 --> 33:25.963
Hemingway collection.

33:25.983 --> 33:26.103
Right.

33:26.183 --> 33:27.845
I had all the first editions in Dust Jack.

33:27.865 --> 33:30.908
But nothing that would attract a writer from Boston to come and see you, right?

33:30.928 --> 33:31.889
That's right.

33:31.949 --> 33:33.291
That's for sure.

33:33.671 --> 33:35.753
But no, there's a point here.

33:35.793 --> 33:39.437
So tell me about opportunity and now what happened?

33:39.457 --> 33:44.843
I mean, now you're, did this occasion you're becoming a dealer in rare books?

33:44.863 --> 33:49.708
No, I made the commitment to become a dealer before, but, you know, having had all of the time,

33:50.093 --> 33:54.459
as a serious collector, you know, I know what this stuff is, and you haven't seen it yet.

33:54.559 --> 34:00.628
You haven't seen it all yet, and I'll continue to show it to you, but, you know, just the wealth of material was just phenomenal.

34:00.648 --> 34:03.392
And just let me briefly show you some more of this stuff.

34:03.412 --> 34:05.695
You've seen the Cosmopolitan article.

34:07.338 --> 34:13.326
This is just a first edition one of 300 things that had a nice box before.

34:13.647 --> 34:20.016
This is the, it's hard to call it a short story,

34:20.823 --> 34:26.330
But it's... Today is Friday.

34:26.690 --> 34:27.772
It's A5A.

34:28.212 --> 34:29.854
I love the story.

34:29.954 --> 34:31.636
Yeah.

34:31.656 --> 34:33.078
And this is the first edition of that.

34:33.579 --> 34:36.743
This was one of the six magazine articles that I got.

34:38.425 --> 34:40.007
Well, well, well, Ernest Hemingway.

34:41.208 --> 34:44.552
Bullfighting, sport and industry.

34:44.572 --> 34:47.275
Page 83 of Fortune magazine from March 1930.

34:47.315 --> 34:49.378
This is the second issue of Fortune magazine.

34:49.645 --> 34:55.594
This was a precursor to death in the afternoon, and it's never been reprinted.

34:56.415 --> 35:05.549
I have permission from the Hemingway family, the lawyers, in writing, to put out a small press edition of this, and I will do that in the next year or so.

35:05.649 --> 35:07.031
I would like an opportunity to buy one.

35:07.051 --> 35:07.311
Sure.

35:07.632 --> 35:08.333
Right.

35:08.353 --> 35:08.633
Okay.

35:08.653 --> 35:09.635
All right.

35:09.655 --> 35:10.656
Yeah.

35:10.676 --> 35:12.339
No, because we have a small Hemingway family.

35:12.359 --> 35:12.559
Right.

35:12.579 --> 35:13.961
Well, this will be an A item.

35:13.981 --> 35:14.081
Yeah.

35:14.101 --> 35:14.783
You're going to sell them?

35:15.263 --> 35:15.464
Right.

35:15.524 --> 35:16.525
I want to buy one.

35:16.545 --> 35:16.725
Sure.

35:16.826 --> 35:17.226
You bet.

35:17.246 --> 35:18.268
All right.

35:18.288 --> 35:18.488
All right.

35:18.670 --> 35:45.724
but very few things have not been republished you know but i was aware this one wasn't and i was you know just sort of parenthetically i'll tell you a quick story i was retained a movie producer read the l.a times article on this acquisition and he called me and said he'd like to to do a movie of green hills of africa and i said well of course you know i do have a type script but the rights for movie don't go with that well

35:46.109 --> 35:48.132
Yeah, but then I started talking.

35:48.152 --> 35:53.580
But I am a lawyer, and I do know the lawyer for the Hemingway family.

35:53.600 --> 35:54.661
Whose name is?

35:54.681 --> 36:04.115
His name is Bobrinsky, B-O-B-R-I-N-S-K-Y, in Chicago.

36:05.016 --> 36:07.680
And I talked to him before, just once before.

36:07.700 --> 36:15.812
So the producer retained me to attempt to acquire the rights to make a motion picture production of Greenhouse of Africa.

36:16.602 --> 36:18.244
So that was one offshoot.

36:18.264 --> 36:21.249
That didn't work out, but it was fun doing it.

36:22.791 --> 36:25.976
And that was because of the publicity for this stuff.

36:25.996 --> 36:27.578
This came again with that collection.

36:28.179 --> 36:30.443
This is one of the first six things I got from this song.

36:30.643 --> 36:34.549
This, and this, and then this.

36:34.569 --> 36:36.472
And this later I got from the daughter.

36:36.792 --> 36:40.057
And these letters, which are really the most magnificent.

36:40.077 --> 36:43.302
This is awfully nice.

36:43.687 --> 36:45.910
I mean, I'll never find anything like this again.

36:45.930 --> 36:47.051
That's a cartoon or a dealer.

36:47.071 --> 36:49.073
You know, this is a launch in a lifetime.

36:49.254 --> 36:51.376
Yeah, this is really a nice type of good fortune.

36:52.017 --> 36:52.958
So this is for you.

36:53.138 --> 36:53.579
Oh, yeah.

36:53.599 --> 36:55.341
And we're going to want you to describe it first.

36:55.401 --> 36:55.881
Sure.

36:55.921 --> 36:56.502
Right on.

37:00.527 --> 37:03.210
Here's Cody, Wyoming.

37:03.891 --> 37:09.677
And this is George Gellhorn, has the honor of announcing the daughter of Emeridge Marfitt and Mr. Henry Harris Hemingway.

37:09.818 --> 37:12.781
That's very nice.

37:12.801 --> 37:13.542
21st of November.

37:13.808 --> 37:14.729
1940.

37:15.270 --> 37:16.451
Cheyenne, Wyoming.

37:16.471 --> 37:18.073
Cheyenne, Wyoming.

37:18.093 --> 37:23.078
And that's in Hemingway's hand to Richard Armstrong, Ambos Mundos Hotel.

37:24.119 --> 37:27.463
Ambos, A-N-B-O-S, Mundos, M-O-N-D-O-S Hotel.

37:28.164 --> 37:35.612
Peaceful, O-B-I-S-P-O-25, telephone, M-dash-9-8-1-1, pardon me, Habana, H-A-B-A-N-A.

37:35.632 --> 37:38.515
The building looks like the Flatiron Building in New York, doesn't it?

37:38.535 --> 37:40.677
Yeah, yeah.

37:43.087 --> 37:46.971
I can say there are nine letters from Werners, 25 letters from Martha Gellhorn, and some other wonderful letters.

37:46.991 --> 37:50.934
This is the most magnificent letter from Gingrich you could ever want.

37:51.275 --> 37:52.195
Well, maybe you could read it.

37:52.215 --> 37:52.396
Okay.

37:52.416 --> 37:53.757
Let's explain to my type of letter.

37:54.057 --> 38:00.823
Arnold Gingrich was the man who was the publisher and editor of Esquire magazine.

38:00.843 --> 38:03.206
And this letter is approximately 1935 or 1936.

38:03.326 --> 38:04.447
It's not dated.

38:04.907 --> 38:06.629
It can be dated from some of the stuff inside of it.

38:06.649 --> 38:08.110
Internally, but it's not dated.

38:08.130 --> 38:08.610
Exactly.

38:09.431 --> 38:10.292
Dear E.H.,

38:10.610 --> 38:19.138
Notice in the November issue of Esquire how SELS, S-E-L-D-E-S, has kept alive the one about the dirty words.

38:19.858 --> 38:23.442
Ernest did an article in defense of dirty words or something like that.

38:23.462 --> 38:27.966
Thought you might miss seeing it since you have nothing in that issue yourself.

38:28.526 --> 38:31.229
Are you going to need all the time I gave you, i.e.

38:31.249 --> 38:34.452
up to the 28th or 29th, to get your December letter in?

38:34.472 --> 38:40.077
I would prefer having copy a few days earlier if I could on account of illustrations, etc.,

38:40.377 --> 38:47.807
unless, of course, you are winding up in your book and can use the extra days to advantage.

38:49.329 --> 38:53.174
How wouldn't it be to write me about Stein and Toklas?

38:53.274 --> 38:56.378
How would it be to write me about Stein and Toklas?

38:57.740 --> 39:07.313
They will be here in November, and probably the newspapers will be spilling a lot of crap in goofy adulation, as indeed they've already begun to do,

39:07.630 --> 39:13.696
as maybe it would be nice to have a 2,000-word fart on that subject.

39:13.796 --> 39:15.478
And Ernest hated Gretchen Stein.

39:15.598 --> 39:16.139
Right.

39:16.579 --> 39:17.200
By then he did.

39:17.700 --> 39:23.065
The controversial stuff seems to be a pure talent of yours.

39:23.526 --> 39:24.447
I can't read that word.

39:27.230 --> 39:28.731
A prize, it looks like.

39:28.831 --> 39:29.412
Oh, a prize.

39:29.432 --> 39:29.712
That's it.

39:29.732 --> 39:30.773
A prize talent of yours.

39:31.374 --> 39:35.578
In our 12 issues to date, that's how you can date the letter, we have...

39:35.930 --> 39:39.834
Never seen anything half as stimulating as the one on dirty words.

39:40.335 --> 39:44.239
Spent a morning with Scott Fitzgerald in Baltimore last week.

39:44.459 --> 39:45.260
What a nice weather.

39:45.280 --> 39:45.580
Yeah.

39:46.241 --> 39:47.682
Or rather, week before last.

39:47.822 --> 40:00.536
Somehow, guessing my interest in you and your stuff, for I had never told him of it, he spent most of the time talking about the days when you and he were in Paris at the same time.

40:01.016 --> 40:02.538
It was a very enjoyable session.

40:03.299 --> 40:04.620
Knopf paid the dough.

40:04.972 --> 40:06.334
Right.

40:07.055 --> 40:11.361
That was due in delivery of my manuscript very promptly.

40:12.823 --> 40:18.251
He has scheduled publication for February 11th, which is my second kid's first birthday.

40:18.792 --> 40:20.515
Still haven't had a chance to go fishing.

40:20.955 --> 40:26.003
Having spent all my time on catching up on work, I let slide in August and September.

40:26.503 --> 40:33.173
Magazine continues to increase in circulation and in advertising, although the latter is coming very slowly.

40:33.743 --> 40:35.145
but at least it's coming in.

40:35.866 --> 40:40.994
However, the whole tone of the publicity we receive every month has changed.

40:41.415 --> 40:49.527
Critical opinion has swung clear around, and we are being wildly booed and panned.

40:50.148 --> 41:02.367
Some of the guys who said the best things about the magazine a few months back are now making the snottiest cracks, notably Harry Hanson,

41:03.089 --> 41:05.892
H-A-N-S-O-N, right?

41:05.912 --> 41:07.453
Maybe S-E-N.

41:09.215 --> 41:10.777
And O-O McIntyre.

41:11.998 --> 41:23.430
As long as they help on discussing the magazine, as long as they keep on discussing the magazine at all, this doesn't bother me.

41:23.910 --> 41:28.074
I'll be pretty bothered if they suddenly shut up and say nothing about it anymore.

41:28.855 --> 41:30.717
You never tell me anything about your book.

41:31.642 --> 41:34.685
Is it finished, and when will it be out?

41:34.705 --> 41:36.487
And is it going to be serialized?

41:36.547 --> 41:40.271
That's the point of the letter, isn't it?

41:40.291 --> 41:40.552
You're right.

41:40.572 --> 41:50.883
And is it going to be serialized, or do I have it, or do I have to wait to see a copy of the book itself?

41:51.383 --> 41:53.486
Don't you get extra proofs?

41:53.766 --> 41:59.252
And if you do, could I borrow a secular over a weekend sometime, or even overnight?

41:59.857 --> 42:02.781
and I'd send it right back the next day.

42:03.342 --> 42:11.795
Not hearing from you for some while, I take it that the fish have been running or that the book has been finishing or both.

42:12.296 --> 42:12.757
Hope so.

42:13.438 --> 42:14.720
Cordially, Arnold Gingrich.

42:15.381 --> 42:17.904
This is the very beginning of Esquire magazine.

42:17.964 --> 42:18.205
Right.

42:19.847 --> 42:24.875
And there's a very famous story about how Gingrich got Hemingway to write for it.

42:24.935 --> 42:28.260
Hemingway basically said, what's the most you pay anyone else?

42:28.662 --> 42:30.724
and double that, and I'll write for you.

42:31.144 --> 42:31.825
And he did.

42:31.965 --> 42:32.326
And he did.

42:33.527 --> 42:36.690
And here's a wonderful letter from Katie Dos Passos.

42:36.710 --> 42:38.011
You don't have to read it.

42:38.531 --> 42:38.652
Okay.

42:38.672 --> 42:43.376
Basically, the letter's to Jane, and this is from Hemingway.

42:43.656 --> 42:47.440
This is from Katie Dos Passos to Jane Armstrong.

42:48.301 --> 42:51.304
Katie's in Key West, and Jane is in Cuba.

42:51.324 --> 42:55.868
She says, Pauline and I are going to New York, or I'm going to New York, and we need some hair done.

42:56.270 --> 42:58.512
Pauline wants blonde and mine is platinum.

42:58.532 --> 43:00.014
There's this place in Cuba you can get it.

43:00.494 --> 43:05.560
Go get it because we'd hate to arrive in New York and have our platinum turned into black roots immediately.

43:06.821 --> 43:13.068
And then Hemingway and Pauline send their love and that sort of stuff.

43:13.588 --> 43:17.132
Here's a letter from Pauline to Ernest.

43:18.033 --> 43:20.696
Ernest had hurt his thumb and was infected.

43:20.736 --> 43:22.918
It's the only thing I have from Pauline.

43:25.177 --> 43:29.643
He's very worried about your finger, keep me informed, love to doses in your poly.

43:30.504 --> 43:33.529
So Hemingway's over in Cuba, fishing, or whatever he did over there.

43:33.769 --> 43:35.532
D-O-S-E-S is for the Dos Passos.

43:35.572 --> 43:41.600
D-O-S-P-A-S is for my type, those two words.

43:43.363 --> 43:46.126
And these are the other nine Hemingway letters.

43:46.807 --> 43:55.099
Some of them really don't have that much interest, but some of them are... Four of them he wrote while he was writing, For Whom the Bell's Ones.

43:55.687 --> 44:02.834
Just to interrupt, this letter from Gingrich to Ernest, the novel, is that, which novel was that?

44:03.494 --> 44:05.576
I believe that would be To Have and Have Not.

44:07.178 --> 44:07.278
Okay.

44:07.298 --> 44:17.287
And I'm not sure, I'd have to find out when Eschire first started, but I, because Greenhouse of Africa was published in 35, and To Have and Have Not was published in 37.

44:17.447 --> 44:20.030
That's something you've got to check out.

44:20.330 --> 44:21.391
Yeah.

44:21.411 --> 44:22.372
Make your letters stronger.

44:22.452 --> 44:24.394
Right on.

44:25.657 --> 44:36.327
This, I'm showing you now, accompanied the first eight chapters of For Whom the Bell Tolls when he delivered it to his typist, this letter.

44:36.727 --> 44:37.648
It's never been folded.

44:39.090 --> 44:40.731
You're welcome to read it if you want.

44:41.192 --> 44:41.712
That's okay.

44:41.732 --> 44:44.995
Okay.

44:45.015 --> 44:49.579
And, like I said, four of the letters were about For Whom the Bell Tolls.

44:49.880 --> 44:52.722
Did you put them in these plastic, or were they...?

44:52.742 --> 44:55.545
No, Lynn Armstrong did, The Daughter of Phyllis.

44:55.913 --> 44:56.594
Well, that was good.

44:56.974 --> 44:57.435
Right.

44:57.455 --> 44:59.818
I had the short story deacidified.

44:59.878 --> 45:01.800
It was like 75 bucks a page.

45:02.781 --> 45:05.444
And I haven't done that to these yet, and it needs to be done.

45:05.705 --> 45:08.889
Because, you know, 75 bucks a page?

45:09.029 --> 45:09.129
Yeah.

45:09.730 --> 45:10.891
I may have made too much.

45:11.171 --> 45:11.872
Where was that from?

45:11.892 --> 45:19.221
A man who works for the museum in San Francisco and the Crocker Museum here, and, you know, does that kind of thing.

45:19.522 --> 45:23.226
I can tell you it's too much.

45:23.406 --> 45:24.848
Yeah, I think it is too.

45:24.968 --> 45:28.872
Jack Craig did our whole thing for less than that.

45:28.892 --> 45:30.493
I'm going to put you in touch with somebody.

45:30.534 --> 45:32.656
Great, thank you.

45:32.676 --> 45:37.761
The Antiquarian Society has their own people that do it.

45:37.781 --> 45:41.225
If you just want to save three, four thousand dollars, you might.

45:41.245 --> 45:42.686
Yeah.

45:42.886 --> 45:44.428
It'd be worth it to hand carry.

45:44.668 --> 45:46.831
This is perhaps the finest letter in the bunch.

45:47.191 --> 45:48.212
The reason for this is

45:48.496 --> 45:52.762
is it gives a plan for to have and have not that no one had ever heard about before.

45:52.782 --> 45:53.903
So let me just read part of it.

45:53.923 --> 45:54.664
And give me the date, please.

45:54.784 --> 45:57.128
Okay, Key West, July 25, 1936.

45:57.168 --> 45:58.650
Which is in pencil.

45:58.850 --> 45:59.290
In pencil.

45:59.331 --> 46:00.452
And then the letter is tied.

46:00.472 --> 46:01.293
The letter is tied.

46:01.313 --> 46:02.094
Yeah.

46:02.114 --> 46:04.237
With a pencil written in postcard.

46:04.257 --> 46:05.779
Or the last signed in.

46:05.799 --> 46:06.200
Whatever.

46:06.460 --> 46:07.562
Yeah.

46:08.383 --> 46:09.244
Dear Dick.

46:09.264 --> 46:11.807
Dear Dick, thanks very much for the pics, kid.

46:11.827 --> 46:17.575
That one of Pauline as the masked marvel will be good to illustrate how to dress for deep-sea fishing for Vogue.

46:18.112 --> 46:19.634
How have you been keeping?

46:19.654 --> 46:22.618
I was really sorry we weren't here when Jane went through.

46:22.838 --> 46:28.206
Richard, I have something I need for this damned book I'm working on that don't know whether you can get or not.

46:29.547 --> 46:38.299
What I want is contemporary newspaper eyewitness accounts that I can rewrite or steal from what facts I want of these events.

46:38.680 --> 46:47.832
The Park Massacre, sacking of Machado Palace, and hunting of paristas, the National Fight, Ataris, the

46:48.385 --> 47:18.156
bc abc the abc massacre funeral of mella the last authentico united front general strike that failed and that the army put down and an account of the ciglius body finding also killing of guterres and any hoven cuba stuff you have could you get me those i suppose some of those times most probably there were no papers in havana could you get them from files of u.s papers in that event

47:18.423 --> 47:26.954
I know this is a hell of a job, but if you can get them for me, we'll give you any amount of manuscripts, first editions, items, etc.

47:27.495 --> 47:31.360
This kind of shows that they had this sort of understanding.

47:32.281 --> 47:32.782
Exactly.

47:32.842 --> 47:37.008
If there are contemporary Cuban accounts, send as many as you can.

47:37.709 --> 47:39.030
Run into each.

47:39.050 --> 47:45.479
I'd like to have them as soon as you can get sent to me at LT Ranch.

47:45.759 --> 47:47.822
L-T, capital Ranch.

47:48.055 --> 48:17.590

We all send you and Jane our very best.

49:19.577 --> 49:20.478
Good luck.

49:20.498 --> 49:21.339
And then in pencil.

49:21.860 --> 49:27.845
And thank you a... I can't remember.

49:27.865 --> 49:29.187
A eternally amount or something.

49:29.207 --> 49:30.068
Something like that.

49:30.168 --> 49:35.753
Amount, which you can... Whenever you can get the stuff ready, Ernest.

49:36.234 --> 49:38.176
Right, I can't forget it.

49:38.196 --> 49:40.998
Everlasting, something like that.

49:41.018 --> 49:42.219
Right.

49:42.239 --> 49:42.900
Wow.

49:42.920 --> 49:43.821
Dick again is who?

49:44.138 --> 49:47.922
Richard Armstrong was head of the International News Bureau in Havana, Cuba.

49:47.962 --> 49:52.807
Let me show you a picture of him.

49:52.827 --> 49:54.548
He's the dear dick in this letter.

49:54.568 --> 49:54.849
Right.

49:55.429 --> 49:57.491
He was a drinking buddy of Havana, Cuba.

49:58.192 --> 50:04.859
I think they probably had the first friendship, and then Jane came into it.

50:05.339 --> 50:10.884
Do we have any way of knowing how much Armstrong complied with the request?

50:11.105 --> 50:11.445
Yes.

50:11.746 --> 50:13.348
That's, I'll tell you that next.

50:13.368 --> 50:14.410
Oh, that's great.

50:14.790 --> 50:15.671
Isn't that wonderful?

50:15.691 --> 50:18.795
Now this, this is, that's Richard Armstrong.

50:18.815 --> 50:19.817
Well, he posed for this ad.

50:19.837 --> 50:20.678
He posed for this ad.

50:20.818 --> 50:22.220
Senior Richard Armstrong.

50:22.240 --> 50:22.921
Did that him?

50:22.941 --> 50:24.763
Chief of International News Service.

50:24.984 --> 50:25.785
Cuban drill.

50:26.245 --> 50:28.128
He smokes white owl cigars, right?

50:28.148 --> 50:28.869
Right, exactly.

50:28.889 --> 50:31.593
That's an ad for white owl cigars with a portly looking guy.

50:31.613 --> 50:33.395
Sidney Street Street kind of a guy.

50:33.415 --> 50:33.816
Right.

50:33.836 --> 50:35.979
In a white suit.

50:36.519 --> 50:36.980
Pucket full of cigars.

50:37.120 --> 50:38.001
Pucket full of cigars.

50:38.021 --> 50:38.542
Pucket full of cigars.

50:38.562 --> 50:39.203
Pucket full of cigars.

50:39.223 --> 50:39.984
Pucket full of cigars.

50:40.084 --> 50:40.825
Those are all Richards.

50:42.543 --> 50:45.106
So they probably met up at a bar or something, huh?

50:45.126 --> 50:45.406
Yeah.

50:45.806 --> 50:46.807
He's a photojournalist.

50:46.908 --> 50:48.890
And Hemingway's a journalist?

50:48.910 --> 50:49.330
You bet.

50:49.350 --> 50:50.652
That's love to hang out with him.

50:50.732 --> 50:52.073
Networking, as they call it.

50:52.093 --> 50:53.034
Right.

50:53.054 --> 50:56.117
Where'd you get that ephemeral stuff?

50:56.798 --> 50:58.800
The trip I went down to buy the stuff from the daughter.

51:00.242 --> 51:05.147
I then went back, I came back to Tampa, or St.

51:05.167 --> 51:12.094
Petersburg, but the next day I drove down again a hundred miles and visited the sun a second time.

51:12.665 --> 51:42.520
and basically is there anything more you have about your family and he came up with some wonderful stuff like for instance this that's that is wonderful oh it is and um yeah basically worthless to anybody else right that's what makes it nice but on that third trip i forgot to show you this i showed you the description yeah that uh talks about the side of the storm what the cosmopolitan piece right but i forgot to show you this photograph this is richard and jane jane armstrong

51:43.259 --> 52:12.793
on the porch and and you can see the havana harbor in the background and that's the site of this very story this upper porch and the inscription is to phyllis here's the very best sort oh here's to the very best sort of new year's sweet sweetheart from daddy and mother 1-1-32 when i got this on the third trip and i recognized that this would be wonderful to have for this story because this is the site of the story you know this is the cosmopolitan march

52:13.297 --> 52:14.880
Issue of March, once again?

52:14.900 --> 52:15.301
1939.

52:15.321 --> 52:15.963
1939.

52:17.265 --> 52:17.566
Yeah.

52:17.586 --> 52:17.766
Okay.

52:18.287 --> 52:20.492
So how many trips did you make to Florida?

52:20.512 --> 52:21.534
Just two.

52:21.554 --> 52:21.695
Uh-huh.

52:22.035 --> 52:22.917
How many would you have made?

52:23.739 --> 52:24.661
I think it's possible.

52:24.681 --> 52:26.445
I'd still be going back if I thought there was more.

52:26.485 --> 52:29.411
Let's talk a little bit about this passion that overtook you now.

52:29.631 --> 52:30.954
We've looked at specifics.

52:31.014 --> 52:32.858
Let's talk about it.

52:33.884 --> 52:36.887
What's going through your mind here as this thing happened?

52:38.629 --> 52:40.270
This thing was developing.

52:40.390 --> 52:47.478
Yeah, there was this eight-month period when I knew the stuff was there and we were so far apart in negotiating.

52:50.100 --> 52:52.062
Briefly, I'll go through what occurred there.

52:52.122 --> 53:02.052
Finally, the book dealer suggested that the typescript was worth more

53:02.504 --> 53:06.389
than I thought it was, because it doesn't have any Tesla corrections in Hemingway's hand.

53:07.290 --> 53:12.077
And so I made a final offer, which was more than I'd made before, and he conveyed that to her.

53:12.117 --> 53:18.745
She still didn't say that she would even sell this stuff, because she'd been talking about maybe giving it to her young son.

53:19.506 --> 53:20.468
So I made her appointment.

53:20.508 --> 53:22.591
I said, well, time is no longer on my side.

53:22.611 --> 53:27.076
It's been eight months, and I keep on going up and haven't heard anything from her, basically.

53:27.197 --> 53:29.760
And I was talking to the book dealer now, not talking to her directly.

53:30.095 --> 53:56.389
So we made an appointment to see her in her town, and I flew back, and my friend, the book dealer, told me after I got off the plane that there'd been a possible glitch, that he'd received a phone call from another book dealer in Florida, closer to where she lived, saying he had some letters from Hemingway

53:56.707 --> 54:01.072
and maybe a possibility of a typescript of Green Hill of America.

54:01.132 --> 54:05.717
So, here I am back there now, you know, pretty anxious.

54:06.718 --> 54:12.124
And so my friend, the book dealer, told the other book dealer, yeah, we'd be interested, you know, how much.

54:16.029 --> 54:19.172
Did this press attention that you got, did that surprise you?

54:22.436 --> 54:25.279
Not really, but, you know, it's not something I sought.

54:25.664 --> 54:30.930
What happened is Lynn had called the press.

54:31.571 --> 54:32.572
Who's Lynn?

54:32.592 --> 54:33.253
Lynn.

54:33.974 --> 54:34.895
The Florida guy.

54:34.915 --> 54:35.876
The Florida woman.

54:35.896 --> 54:36.537
Florida woman.

54:36.557 --> 54:39.560
The daughter, where I got the second group of stuff from.

54:40.241 --> 54:47.550
And so when we got to this small Florida town, not knowing what to expect, knowing that she had contacted another book dealer.

54:48.190 --> 54:54.658
And in that eight months we're talking to her, for all I know, she could have started contacting people in New York, which, of course, I didn't want.

54:55.043 --> 54:56.685
You know, or option houses.

54:56.745 --> 54:57.886
Oh, sure.

54:57.946 --> 54:59.287
And it's a whole other ballgame.

54:59.348 --> 54:59.788
You bet.

55:01.109 --> 55:01.930
More than likely.

55:02.831 --> 55:03.372
Big bucks.

55:04.173 --> 55:06.615
Yeah, well, I pay big bucks for it.

55:06.635 --> 55:11.621
But, you know, query whether or not she could have gotten more, and she probably could have.

55:11.641 --> 55:12.882
But nationally, I didn't want that to happen.

55:12.902 --> 55:14.023
I didn't want any competition.

55:14.524 --> 55:18.828
But, you know, for this eight-month period, she could have contacted anyone she wanted.

55:18.848 --> 55:20.250
In any case, we get down there.

55:20.390 --> 55:22.712
We meet at the conference room of her bank.

55:22.732 --> 55:23.413
She's not there.

55:24.372 --> 55:27.355
The people at the Met told me, she's over-xeroxing the stuff.

55:27.375 --> 55:28.636
And that was the first good sign.

55:28.656 --> 55:31.999
If she's xeroxing the stuff, she's going to sell it to me.

55:32.019 --> 55:32.980
So then she got there.

55:33.200 --> 55:36.283
And she was really courteous, a really nice woman.

55:36.303 --> 55:37.624
And the press was there.

55:37.665 --> 55:40.567
They took some pictures of her holding up some of the stuff.

55:40.948 --> 55:42.149
And wanted to interview me.

55:42.169 --> 55:44.391
I said, your feeling must be, oh, please.

55:44.471 --> 55:45.252
Exactly.

55:45.272 --> 55:45.652
Exactly.

55:45.672 --> 55:46.193
You got it.

55:47.334 --> 55:48.835
Basically, it was, get out.

55:48.855 --> 55:49.596
Let's do this deal.

55:49.616 --> 55:51.718
If I get the stuff, I'd be happy to talk to you.

55:51.738 --> 55:52.919
Right now, you're a distraction.

55:53.059 --> 55:54.160
Oh, a major distraction.

55:54.410 --> 55:57.435
And so they took the pictures and then left.

55:57.455 --> 55:58.917
No, this was local press, Florida press?

55:58.937 --> 55:59.858
This is local press.

56:00.259 --> 56:03.444
Have you got any copies of these stories, by the way, Seth?

56:04.766 --> 56:08.732
I've got some stuff over there, some public stuff that I'll give you.

56:08.792 --> 56:08.992
Good.

56:10.935 --> 56:11.416
So, go ahead.

56:11.436 --> 56:11.696
Excuse me.

56:11.716 --> 56:19.388
Anyway, so then Lynn and I and the book dealer sat down in the room, and I made another offer, which was more than any figure that had ever been mentioned before.

56:20.689 --> 56:22.392
And she accepted it.

56:23.131 --> 56:24.913
So we're all happy.

56:24.933 --> 56:27.116
Not until the check is signed in the papers.

56:27.136 --> 56:29.419
Did you have any kind of contract?

56:29.439 --> 56:31.862
Well, yeah, we made a very brief contract, basically.

56:32.443 --> 56:38.210
You know, what the stuff was, and then I was buying it, and we also signed the book dealer, Lynn, and myself.

56:38.491 --> 56:44.138
And how did you get to be, own the rights to that unpublished, that piece over there that you showed me?

56:45.860 --> 56:48.423
That unpublished, the Fortune magazine piece?

56:48.443 --> 56:51.467
I talked to the book, I talked to the Hemingway lawyer once before.

56:51.785 --> 57:04.943
And then the movie producer, the guy who produced the Presidio with Sean Connery, and earlier he was, I think, the producer or co-producer of Breathless with Richard Gare a few years earlier.

57:04.963 --> 57:08.267
But, you know, a serious producer in Hollywood.

57:09.769 --> 57:20.323
So I'm talking to Bob Brinsky about this, one of our conversations, and I mentioned that I'm aware of some unpublished Hemingway items, and I intend to be a small press publisher.

57:20.607 --> 57:25.912
So I start talking about this, and ask him directly, and then write him a letter, and he writes me a letterbox.

57:26.252 --> 57:27.113
That's pretty nice.

57:28.074 --> 57:29.495
You don't have to pay him anything?

57:29.515 --> 57:33.699
Yeah, you wanted me to make a donation to the Hemingway Foundation.

57:34.340 --> 57:36.502
That's really very decent.

57:36.642 --> 57:39.064
Oh, it certainly is, yeah.

57:40.506 --> 57:41.066
That's great.

57:41.887 --> 57:42.788
That's a good story.

57:43.969 --> 57:49.534
One thing we haven't really addressed is why

57:49.784 --> 57:52.046
I noticed you've got some Walker Percy books up there.

57:52.086 --> 57:56.311
You have a William Styron, Mario Puzo, but these are books for stock, right?

57:56.671 --> 57:56.832
Yeah.

57:56.872 --> 57:59.815
These are books that you sell, Ken Kesey, London.

57:59.895 --> 58:00.255
Whatever.

58:00.856 --> 58:02.418
But you really only collect Hemingway.

58:03.559 --> 58:04.360
Yeah.

58:04.640 --> 58:07.423
Well, Larry McMurtry, I'm pretty interested in.

58:07.443 --> 58:08.604
And I like mystery writers, too.

58:09.245 --> 58:10.266
You collect?

58:10.286 --> 58:11.988
Well, I wouldn't say collect really now.

58:12.248 --> 58:15.752
I mean, I have most of the stuff, but mostly it's really part of an inventory.

58:16.693 --> 58:19.656
Tell me why the passion for Hemingway.

58:22.775 --> 58:37.976
I guess I can sort of obliquely, I've read the first chapter, first two chapters to Afraid of World Arms a couple hundred times, and it's like music to me.

58:37.996 --> 58:39.939
I mean, it's just beautiful.

58:40.399 --> 58:44.425
It's like when you listen to some great music and you have a real emotional response to it.

58:44.846 --> 58:48.350
You know, some of Hemingway, I react that way too.

58:48.491 --> 58:50.233
And then...

58:50.770 --> 58:59.844
I don't know all the emotions that go into being a collector, but once you start, I think it's the hunt, really.

59:00.225 --> 59:04.031
Possessing the stuff isn't that great, but it's the fun of the hunt.

59:04.071 --> 59:17.892
That's why I decided to go into the business and virtually put all of the stuff for sale, because the hunt was fun, but once you have everything, then it's not that fun anymore, because so seldom do you find something you don't have.

59:18.901 --> 59:25.768
I guess, obviously, the culmination to my collecting was finding this one magnificent person.

59:25.809 --> 59:27.330
How old are you?

59:27.350 --> 59:27.550
49.

59:27.570 --> 59:29.012
49.

59:29.312 --> 59:33.877
But you would say that that's a young man, is the reason I ask.

59:35.559 --> 59:41.085
You could collect for 25 more years, but do you think that you'll find an experience as great as this?

59:41.606 --> 59:42.427
No, I don't think so.

59:42.447 --> 59:43.368
I can't imagine.

59:44.869 --> 59:48.233
I can't imagine there being, there existing, a closet full of

59:48.365 --> 59:50.949
of original Hemingway material, and they're made.

59:51.229 --> 59:53.192
Well, they're at the Hemingway, but that's my point.

59:53.212 --> 59:54.193
You just collect Hemingway.

59:54.233 --> 59:58.499
You might find the Larry McMurtry thing someplace, but that doesn't, this is the kick.

59:58.779 --> 59:59.801
Yeah, right.

01:00:00.081 --> 01:00:04.507
And now I sense it's all for sale, technically.

01:00:04.567 --> 01:00:05.088
Is that correct?

01:00:05.248 --> 01:00:05.549
Sure.

01:00:05.629 --> 01:00:06.410
The price is right?

01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:09.855
Well, right, but I haven't, you know, I've had it for two, two and a half years.

01:00:09.895 --> 01:00:16.884
I haven't carefully cataloged it and described it and advertised it and, you know, I haven't really tried to sell it.

01:00:16.904 --> 01:00:17.325
I mean, it's,

01:00:17.609 --> 01:00:45.473
eminently saleable material let's say a guy like maury neville walks in yeah and says right um here's the check i've signed it you and he has the means to do something like yes he does and he's a very careful collector he's been a book dealer for a lot of years so he tends to want to buy things wholesale so the truth is i probably wouldn't sell it to maury but there's some retail customers out there who would be a better market and if i wanted to you know once i

01:00:45.925 --> 01:00:56.681
get into selling it, then it's something that I'll make a description of and give descriptions to four or five people who have wonderful collections and the means to buy it.

01:00:57.322 --> 01:00:59.766
So you expect at some point, realistically, to sell it.

01:00:59.786 --> 01:01:01.508
Yeah.

01:01:01.528 --> 01:01:02.410
You're going to enjoy it.

01:01:02.971 --> 01:01:03.271
Right.

01:01:03.391 --> 01:01:05.494
In the meantime, I'm not terribly anxious to do that.

01:01:05.514 --> 01:01:06.576
That's a nice story.

01:01:07.117 --> 01:01:09.881
It's a good story for us.

01:01:09.961 --> 01:01:14.548
And it's a good story because it does illustrate that for you, the excitement was really in the hunt.

01:01:14.782 --> 01:01:19.729
The anxiety that JFK could be breathing down your neck, for instance.

01:01:20.111 --> 01:01:21.518
Or Maury Neville could be...
