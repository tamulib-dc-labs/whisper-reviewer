00:03.338 --> 00:21.980
I think what drew me to the subject initially was the desire to write a book about the American home front during the war.

00:22.580 --> 00:27.546
And on that score, at least I knew that there hadn't really been a lot of books written.

00:27.946 --> 00:32.772
There had been some wonderful essay books about the home front, one by John Blum,

00:33.072 --> 00:36.518
at Yale and another one by Richard Lingaman, but they were topical.

00:36.918 --> 00:39.262
Civil rights, women in the factory, mobilization.

00:39.683 --> 00:45.793
And there really hadn't been a study of Roosevelt's leadership during the war on the home front.

00:45.893 --> 00:48.898
I mean, most books invariably just go right into the war itself.

00:49.519 --> 00:54.186
So at least I knew I was carving out an area within Roosevelt.

00:54.470 --> 01:21.051
enormous literature that had been relatively not done and when i went to the roosevelt library the first time this wonderful man who's now retired but was the roosevelt library director and i said do you think i can do this or has this already been done and he was so supportive he said no it hasn't been done you got to do it so that offered me at least when i started i had no idea when i started it would become the story it became about franklin and eleanor and all the people in the white house that emerged through the research

01:21.301 --> 01:25.730
which gave it another angle, hopefully, that hadn't been really focused on before.

01:26.291 --> 01:33.807
You mentioned Eleanor and Franklin, of course, and you also mentioned a young Joe Lash, and he has written that book, Eleanor and Franklin.

01:33.827 --> 01:39.158
So it really had to be kind of a gutsy thing for you to... I think, in fact, it's interesting because...

01:39.577 --> 01:50.032
Years ago, I think I had thought about doing something on Eleanor Roosevelt just because of how much I respected and admired and wanted to know more about her, but was daunted by the fact that Lash's book was out there.

01:50.312 --> 02:00.707
So it was really only when I came up with this particular period of time, which only occupies a few chapters in Lash's book, that I knew that it would be a new angle on the thing.

02:00.727 --> 02:04.252
You mentioned the Usher diary, among many other things.

02:04.292 --> 02:04.993
Tell me about

02:05.497 --> 02:12.910
the kinds of materials that were fresh and that were new that allowed you, that enabled you to do a fresh work.

02:13.310 --> 02:30.880
Well, what made the Usher's Diaries so important is, and they exist in the Roosevelt Library, but I think what happens is if you use them in the library, it takes so much time to copy down everything that's in the page of the library that you probably only use them sporadically, I think, as maybe some other scholars have.

02:31.096 --> 02:40.405
When I saw how wonderful they were documenting every minute, Roosevelt awakens at 7.10, you know, massage at 7.20, breakfast at so-and-so, lunch with somebody.

02:41.006 --> 02:49.214
Once I knew, for example, he had lunch with Stimson, I could go to Stimson's diary for that day, or if it was Icky's or Morgenthau, and they would describe what happened at that lunch that day.

02:49.654 --> 02:54.078
Once I knew that he had met with somebody for dinner who might have had a memoir written about them, I could go to that.

02:54.098 --> 03:00.765
It was almost like the building block of creating what life was like for these people over this five-year period.

03:01.015 --> 03:02.917
And what happened is I just bought the Usher's Diaries.

03:02.937 --> 03:04.639
I mean, it turns out it's like $200.

03:04.779 --> 03:07.241
It's not this huge investment.

03:07.261 --> 03:18.212
And we rented a microfiche reader so that we actually could, I mean, my research assistant and I typed out these huge chronologies that told every Usher's Diary what it did every single day.

03:19.093 --> 03:23.057
So that it just became the way of knowing where else to go.

03:23.077 --> 03:27.541
It was almost like the first understanding that let me know what other resources to go to.

03:27.921 --> 03:29.723
And you were actually able to reconstruct

03:30.260 --> 03:32.663
reliably, almost to the point of documenting it.

03:32.683 --> 03:40.613
Very early on, you had Eleanor coming home, and Franklin's in the room talking to... Right, right, right.

03:41.174 --> 03:42.876
Well, you know, that's an interesting example.

03:43.517 --> 03:59.237
When I was in California for the year, when Dick was getting the quiz show made, we had dinner one night with Billy Wilder, the director of Billy Wilder of Sunset Boulevard, and he's the one who told me the story about Helen Cahagan Douglas, and he thought it was the night that Germany had invaded Western Europe.

03:59.504 --> 04:25.225
um that's what the story had come down to him over the years but you never know for sure is that right and i was so excited when i saw in the usher's diary tell him to hagan douglas sleeping there at that actual life so it just it i think what it made me able to do it's not speculative that's right i mean we can talk about it later but when i got to lucy mercer coming back into the story up until this time no one's quite known when she reappeared they know he was she was with him when he died

04:25.407 --> 04:30.195
They knew she was with him back in 1918, but some people assumed he was having an affair with her all of his life.

04:30.275 --> 04:32.319
Some people didn't know when she came in or out.

04:34.442 --> 04:35.404
That's right.

04:35.424 --> 04:44.279
When I looked at the Usher's Diaries, though, I could see exactly when she returned to have dinner with him and know what he was doing the rest of that day so you can give it a little substance and context.

04:44.980 --> 04:47.805
So I think that was the first thing that allowed a new look at it.

04:48.426 --> 04:51.651
Were you hopeful that you could shade any, give any news?

04:51.749 --> 04:55.421
insight into the characters, the character of the principals?

04:56.625 --> 05:04.290
Well, I think what was lucky and what happened is that to the extent that I would define the principal characters as

05:04.523 --> 05:27.763
not only Franklin and Eleanor but Missy LaHand and the daughter Anna Roosevelt and Harry Hopkins I mean it's amazing that he moved in I know maybe I'd known that but I'm so glad I mean the whole idea I had not ever absorbed that they're all living there you know the picture of Winston Churchill padding around in the middle of the night and was that known by the way I don't think so I mean certainly nobody knew that Lorena Hickok was living there she deliberately kept that secret

05:28.013 --> 05:34.499
And people knew at the time that Harry was there, but I don't think people ever put together before that they were all there at the same time.

05:35.199 --> 05:44.808
And what turned out to make, I hope, some new looks at all those people were a series of lucky interviews, in a sense.

05:45.208 --> 05:53.775
What happened is Chip O'Neil, it turned out, had lived in Somerville, not far from his Cambridge Somerville, from Missy Lehan, where she grew up.

05:54.216 --> 05:56.738
So he got me to find some of Missy's relatives.

05:56.971 --> 06:00.094
And Missy had never been fully created as a character before.

06:00.114 --> 06:09.722
It's interesting, when you read the works about Roosevelt, there's testament in those works, like Rosenman's speech-writing book about Roosevelt and Frankfurter's memoirs.

06:09.983 --> 06:18.750
They will say Missy was one of the most indispensable people to Roosevelt and that her death was catastrophic to him and that she was not only a secretary and a companion, but shrewd and an important advisor.

06:19.171 --> 06:22.794
And I think because she was a secretary, she had been discounted in some ways.

06:23.374 --> 06:26.337
Anyway, because of Chip, I found one group of Missy's relatives

06:26.435 --> 06:34.911
and then was able to go to Connecticut to interview her grandniece who had this trunk in the attic that she'd had for all these years that had all of this stuff of Missy's in it.

06:35.172 --> 06:35.913
It was so exciting.

06:35.933 --> 06:37.275
You can imagine.

06:37.877 --> 06:41.784
She brought down the trunk and it had letters that Missy had written.

06:41.844 --> 06:48.156
It had all the inaugural and all the addresses Roosevelt had ever given when she gave a copy up to Missy, to Missy, who I couldn't have done this without.

06:48.136 --> 06:57.535
And then I describe it only shortly in the book, but my favorite moment in that whole interview is the death that she had in a bed, beautiful furniture that they had saved from her.

06:57.916 --> 07:07.174
And that's when I said to them, but I know the most important thing to her, because I had read her will, was this hanging bookcase that Roosevelt had made for her, which she decreed in her will.

07:07.424 --> 07:11.250
that she wanted to go to one of her nieces because she valued it so much because she had made it.

07:11.570 --> 07:18.721
And all of a sudden this woman says to me, oh my God, you know, there was such a bookcase and it was in my brother's garage.

07:18.881 --> 07:22.888
And we had this feeling that there might be a story behind it, but it was really ugly.

07:23.188 --> 07:24.991
And we sold it in a garage sale.

07:25.011 --> 07:29.257
It was just one of those moments where you say, no, bring it back.

07:29.317 --> 07:29.738
I know.

07:29.778 --> 07:33.323
And unfortunately the person who got it has no idea what's going on.

07:33.404 --> 07:34.085
Exactly, exactly.

07:34.285 --> 07:35.887
But so that was really helpful.

07:35.927 --> 07:36.368
And then

07:36.500 --> 07:50.178
And then once I knew that Anna Roosevelt was going to be important to me, because, again, from the Usher's Diaries, I knew that she lived there that last year and a half, I was able to talk at long length to her three children, especially her daughter, her oldest daughter.

07:50.398 --> 07:52.741
Well, you're really getting people at the end.

07:52.942 --> 07:53.843
Oh, yeah.

07:54.003 --> 07:58.930
I mean, some of the people that you were so fortunate enough to know.

07:58.950 --> 08:04.617
Well, I mean, Alonzo Fields, the butler at the White House, the black butler, died just about six months or so ago.

08:04.833 --> 08:09.599
And he's the one who, he was there actually through Hoover, through Roosevelt, through Truman.

08:10.300 --> 08:12.263
And he had a fabulous memory.

08:12.283 --> 08:13.925
And he lived in Medford, Massachusetts.

08:14.466 --> 08:16.869
And again, I had no idea he was still alive.

08:16.909 --> 08:19.392
Chip O'Neill one time I'm with him said, have you interviewed Alonzo?

08:19.653 --> 08:20.874
He of course knows all these people.

08:20.955 --> 08:22.136
I said, Alonzo's alive?

08:22.176 --> 08:23.238
I mean, I knew who he was.

08:23.718 --> 08:24.359
Oh, he was great.

08:24.740 --> 08:27.263
I knew that he'd been there because I'd heard of him.

08:27.479 --> 08:37.634
And he had long ago written a book, but the book was written with somebody else and didn't have anywhere near the kind of incredible detailed memories about the Roosevelt administration because his book had to cover all of this stuff.

08:37.654 --> 08:38.936
But I had no idea he was alive.

08:40.278 --> 08:42.862
So I went to see him and had this incredible time at his house.

08:42.942 --> 08:51.676
And he's the one who told me about that first night that Churchill came to the White House when he overheard Eleanor and Franklin arguing because Eleanor was saying, he didn't even tell me he was coming.

08:51.696 --> 08:52.677
What's the matter with you?

08:52.842 --> 09:00.671
And then Churchill yelling at him the next morning and saying there were certain ground rules to be followed the next three weeks that he was going to be there.

09:00.691 --> 09:01.933
No whistling in the corridor.

09:02.233 --> 09:04.115
He had to have wine every morning for breakfast.

09:04.135 --> 09:06.618
He had to have 90-proof brandy for drinks at night.

09:06.979 --> 09:08.941
And Alonzo said he wasn't even angry about it.

09:09.001 --> 09:10.062
It was like a drill sergeant.

09:10.102 --> 09:12.145
He thought it was fine establishing the ground rules.

09:12.165 --> 09:13.767
And he told me some other wonderful things.

09:13.787 --> 09:14.968
And then I got to...

09:15.117 --> 09:39.454
the doctor who was with roosevelt when he died he was 95 years old wow and he lives down in in new york so i went to these people well i didn't get to alonzo until the middle of it all because i didn't really know about it i know i mean i what happened is i had called a friend of mine who was a doctor um and he i knew he might know through the medical establishment how to find out if this guy was still alive and he found out for me that he was alive and where he was living and so i found him

09:39.738 --> 09:41.340
Was he able to do you anything?

09:41.640 --> 10:08.614
Yeah, I mean, he's the one who told me that, I mean, see, the things that, I mean, he had written an article about Roosevelt's medical condition in the Journal of Medicine a long time ago, so I had that, so I'm not sure I learned anything new about his actual medical condition, but the kind of things he was able to talk to me about, which I thought were really valuable, was the fact that Eleanor didn't really accept that he was dying, that he could see that she just kept...

10:08.729 --> 10:33.707
wanting him to do things and be places and it wasn't because she was being mean to him but because she just hadn't um willed into her mind that he was really dying she kept thinking he'd get better and he described this one scene that's in the book of her calling him she's been told that nobody's supposed to bother him at a certain time when he's when he's going down to warm springs to relax and she called him three times about a minor issue you know and she's and he was upset with her at that time

10:34.058 --> 10:43.485
And then he also described the difference that Anna somehow saw that her father was dying, and that's why she could give him the relaxation, and that's probably why he took her to Yalta instead of Eleanor.

10:43.545 --> 10:44.608
So that kind of...

10:44.740 --> 10:53.089
understanding of the dynamics of the relationships I couldn't have gotten without somebody who was thinking about Roosevelt's health and how it affected the mother and the daughter.

10:53.129 --> 10:54.431
This is just about it, really.

10:54.571 --> 11:04.182
I can't imagine any future writer or biographer having access to any people with any meaningful reflection of it.

11:04.442 --> 11:07.305
If I tried to do it ten years later, it would have been impossible.

11:07.522 --> 11:09.645
So that's what made it fun.

11:09.745 --> 11:10.567
I mean, it really was.

11:10.627 --> 11:12.630
Were there any epiphanous moments for you?

11:12.690 --> 11:15.234
I mean, any moments of great discovery?

11:15.875 --> 11:22.545
Well, you know, I think when I went out, I saw Jimmy and Elliot before they died, the two Roosevelt boys.

11:22.605 --> 11:23.887
They both died, too.

11:23.927 --> 11:26.091
That's the end of the Roosevelt children.

11:27.072 --> 11:31.639
And I think when Jimmy told me the story of...

11:32.345 --> 11:43.131
His father essentially asking his mother to be his wife again in September of 42 after Missy had had her stroke and after his mother Sarah had died when he was so lonely.

11:43.212 --> 11:48.220
that he needed Eleanor more as a companion even than as a political partner.

11:48.921 --> 11:54.130
And Ginny believed that what he was asking her was essentially to be his wife again in all aspects.

11:54.150 --> 11:55.853
In other words, let's come back together.

11:56.654 --> 12:08.494
And the terrible dilemma put Eleanor in, knowing that she loved him, knowing that he was lonely without Missy and his mother, but also knowing that she couldn't let herself be so vulnerable to hurt again, so that she eventually...

12:08.845 --> 12:16.196
without necessarily saying no, but asked him if he could go on another trip to England, which meant rejecting his plea.

12:17.158 --> 12:31.841
I found that what was so important about that story was it showed me most people have assumed that by this time in their life, their marriage has just sort of removed itself to a totally unemotional plane, and they're just partners.

12:32.602 --> 12:36.608
And I had inklings of feelings even before talking to Jimmy about that moment.

12:36.773 --> 12:38.637
that there was a lot more going on between them.

12:38.697 --> 12:45.029
Because I could see the letters, I could see her disappointments at times when she was waiting for him or he was waiting for her.

12:46.252 --> 12:52.264
But that confirmed for me that almost what I think I've tried to portray, that they keep missing each other.

12:52.404 --> 12:55.069
You know, one wants the other and the other one's not there.

12:55.133 --> 13:00.079
But that meant that their relationship was still alive and open to hurt and to need.

13:00.119 --> 13:06.467
There are certain personality things that are never going to change, like one of the kids says, you just wish your mother would lighten up every once in a while.

13:06.587 --> 13:09.211
That's right.

13:09.291 --> 13:14.337
I mean, I think their temperaments were opposite from the very beginning.

13:14.357 --> 13:23.689
I mean, my argument is, at least just the way I think about it, that that's partly what drew them together in the beginning, because you sometimes do fall in love with those opposite traits.

13:23.922 --> 13:29.147
And I think he saw her principled ethical side, and she was much more serious than all those debutante girls he knew.

13:29.207 --> 13:33.712
And he had that serious side, obviously, underneath his own playboy side.

13:33.752 --> 13:34.732
Had he enjoyed a good time.

13:35.393 --> 13:35.894
That's right.

13:36.214 --> 13:41.179
And I think what happened over time was that he teased her that she had a backbone that never bent.

13:41.759 --> 13:42.900
And he needed to relax.

13:43.061 --> 13:53.811
I mean, the one thing I think that was hardest for him about Eleanor was that because of his polio, the only way he could relax was to talk, to have cocktails, to gossip.

13:54.297 --> 13:56.461
And he couldn't play tennis, he couldn't play golf.

13:56.521 --> 13:58.585
He had to have that kind of relaxation.

13:59.086 --> 14:01.490
And that kind of small talk was the hardest thing for her.

14:01.551 --> 14:05.979
She was never at ease with it, nor was she at ease with cocktails because of her alcoholic father.

14:06.540 --> 14:08.123
And she couldn't stop working.

14:08.143 --> 14:16.879
She couldn't stop bringing up civil rights in the middle of that cocktail hour or picking the film and making it a film about rapes of wrath or something like that.

14:17.045 --> 14:18.290
And I don't even blame her.

14:18.371 --> 14:20.520
I think she had never learned how to play.

14:20.540 --> 14:22.367
I mean, that was absent from her childhood.

14:22.769 --> 14:26.886
She once said way at the end of her life that she would have given anything to have learned how to flirt.

14:27.322 --> 14:29.324
But she hadn't learned those things.

14:29.344 --> 14:35.692
And in a bizarrely ironic kind of way, I mean, her discovery of the affair with Mercer almost did liberate her in a way, didn't it?

14:35.712 --> 14:36.713
Oh, I have no question.

14:37.153 --> 14:50.489
I mean, I think given what a woman faced in 1918, especially someone like Eleanor, who was not fulfilled fully by her role as a wife and mother because she had so much trouble bringing up her kids.

14:50.949 --> 14:52.671
She'd never been mothers herself.

14:52.651 --> 14:55.756
and Sarah was an ever-present figure in that triangle.

14:56.317 --> 15:12.482
When the fear happened, it freed her to go outside that smaller environment and find that she had this incredible range of skills in the outside world, in public speaking and organizing and fighting for issues, and she became a much more confident person than she'd been, and had that not happened,

15:12.715 --> 15:14.477
she wouldn't have had that door open to her.

15:15.018 --> 15:17.582
Oh, can you imagine?

15:17.702 --> 15:20.105
It's everybody's worst nightmare.

15:20.266 --> 15:27.256
I mean, I think that's got to be, because I think everybody can empathize with what she must have experienced when she saw those letters.

15:27.356 --> 15:30.260
Have those letters been destroyed or have they been destroyed?

15:30.580 --> 15:39.533
The only letter that anyone knows of, any full letter, there's a couple little notes that exist from Lucy, it's the one that's printed at the end of the book that she writes to Anna.

15:39.715 --> 15:46.584
So, somebody had said, Madame Shumatov claimed, Lucy's friend, that Lucy burned all of his letters after he died.

15:46.884 --> 15:47.926
Possibly.

15:47.946 --> 15:48.246
Yeah, maybe.

15:48.266 --> 15:50.349
Maybe they're somewhere, but possibly, yes.

15:50.409 --> 15:52.752
What do you think they tell us that you don't already know?

15:53.012 --> 15:53.553
I don't know.

15:53.733 --> 16:05.689
I mean, I think, I mean, what the letter to Anna was helpful for was just showing that she was a really substantial person, Lucy, and sensitive and perceptive about the relations of the family.

16:05.838 --> 16:18.037
And I thought so diplomatic about saying, forgive me for talking of these things because I am an outsider and your father's just died, but I thought you'd want to know how much he loved you and how he talked about you to me all the time.

16:18.077 --> 16:34.022
And then again, when Anna's daughter, Eleanor Seagraves, told me that Anna kept that letter in her bedtime side table all her life because it validated the kind of father-daughter relationship and also validated how special Lucy was, which made her decision...

16:34.289 --> 16:37.835
to bring them together, a viable one rather than a betraying one.

16:38.215 --> 16:51.977
And you certainly point out, and this is something that you said, I thought so eloquently on the Today Show the other day, I mean, you really, these four women at one time, I don't think I'd ever, I mean, I've read any other books on FDR and the family, but

16:52.750 --> 16:59.239
I mean, these four people there, almost the mother, the daughter, the wife.

16:59.720 --> 17:02.243
You might talk a little bit about that.

17:02.864 --> 17:06.529
Actually, one other question while I think about it.

17:06.729 --> 17:09.033
That is a half a century, actually, since he's gone.

17:09.854 --> 17:19.467
And I think you actually are able now, with this patented time, to define the nature of the relationship perhaps more

17:20.324 --> 17:26.072
in greater detail than it's ever more perspective perhaps than it's been done before.

17:26.492 --> 17:49.943
No, I mean, I think it may be true that, I mean, certainly at the time, there's such emotions swirling around, an independent woman who is the wife of the President of the United States, and in some ways watching Eleanor live the rest of her life out after his death and knowing that she came to terms with his life and with the sadness he had caused to her

17:50.125 --> 17:52.687
and somehow incorporated him into herself.

17:52.707 --> 18:01.335
I mean, my sense is in those last 17 years of her life, she became a more practical politician because she no longer had to be the idealistic half against his pragmatic half.

18:01.675 --> 18:02.496
She became both.

18:02.996 --> 18:12.765
Seeing all of that helps to, from the 50-year vantage, helps to see, I think, what role he played and what role she played that you might not have seen right up close.

18:12.885 --> 18:14.026
I think that's probably right.

18:14.366 --> 18:20.031
And a corollary to that is, after 50 years, it is amazing how...

18:20.821 --> 18:43.723
resonant that relationship is i mean this isn't something that's ephemeral no that's right this is something that'll that'll be as long as american history is studied i think oh i think so too i mean i i i mean it certainly seems like i think in terms of the two of them i mean franklin roosevelt has got to be if not the certainly one of the most important figures in american history in the 20th century

18:43.906 --> 18:47.435
And she's probably one of the most important women in the 20th century in American life.

18:47.455 --> 18:48.779
I mean, my recollections are of her.

18:48.799 --> 18:50.242
I'm 51 now.

18:50.262 --> 18:57.220
And I remember my mother and my aunt being, you know, great elderly people.

18:57.260 --> 18:59.105
Supporters of my father being the Republic.

18:59.165 --> 18:59.907
But I remember...

19:00.359 --> 19:04.726
Eleanor Roosevelt, they used to introduce her as the first lady of the world.

19:04.967 --> 19:06.169
Right, exactly right.

19:06.189 --> 19:07.451
That's exactly right.

19:07.471 --> 19:12.900
And boy, if she said, I, by Adelaide, she took this very seriously.

19:12.921 --> 19:13.321
That's right.

19:13.361 --> 19:15.064
No, she had a real following.

19:15.084 --> 19:18.109
This isn't like the Reagan supporting Dan Quayle or something like that.

19:18.149 --> 19:19.832
No, no, I understand.

19:19.872 --> 19:21.956
Exactly, that's right.

19:22.337 --> 19:26.063
There's a wonderful moment, actually, which is not in the book because it was past my time.

19:26.465 --> 19:36.738
Somebody told me the story that she was with Adlai Stevenson once in Harlem, and all sorts of blacks were hammering to get in the car and talk to him, and he didn't know what to do, and he just sat there.

19:37.179 --> 19:44.648
And she told somebody she knew then, as much as she loved him, that he didn't have—FDR would have rolled the windows down, had his arms out everywhere.

19:45.169 --> 19:49.114
It was a really interesting—she just saw it at that moment.

19:49.364 --> 19:57.035
And just to the side as well, I remember one of my interviews with Rob Brady, he said, as much as he loves Stevenson, he said, there were a lot of unread books in his library.

19:57.055 --> 19:58.036
Wow.

19:58.837 --> 20:00.059
I mean, the egghead thing.

20:00.119 --> 20:00.980
Exactly.

20:01.040 --> 20:02.943
But a lot of it was interesting.

20:02.963 --> 20:03.344
That's interesting.

20:03.524 --> 20:07.329
He said, there were a lot of unread books in his library.

20:07.349 --> 20:08.491
I've never used a quote.

20:08.591 --> 20:09.612
Yeah, it's a wonderful quote, yeah.

20:09.632 --> 20:10.393
You might ask him.

20:10.413 --> 20:12.096
Yeah, that's terrific.

20:12.596 --> 20:14.319
Anyway, you were about to know about four women.

20:14.419 --> 20:15.360
Oh, the other four women.

20:15.380 --> 20:18.004
Oh, what was so much fun, um,

20:18.136 --> 20:21.960
Tell me about the influence of women in his life, just a softball down the middle.

20:22.440 --> 20:33.490
Well, I mean, what I found so fascinating to research was that in a certain sense, you had almost every kind of woman's role surrounding him.

20:34.031 --> 20:40.717
I mean, obviously the mother who remains critical to him the rest of her life, and she's a very big figure.

20:40.737 --> 20:47.603
I mean, the fact that she lives and only dies four years before him and is almost with him from the beginning until the end,

20:47.937 --> 20:52.742
with both the strengths and the weaknesses that that kind of intrusive mother brings.

20:53.583 --> 20:57.467
I mean, they move in.

20:57.507 --> 21:11.582
They move in, and she literally... I know, I always tease my kids about the story of MacArthur's mother coming to West Point and looking to see if his light was on when he was studying.

21:11.832 --> 21:22.564
Sarah felt nothing intrusive about coming up to Boston to take that townhouse when he's at Harvard or, I mean, incredibly buying double townhouses for them in New York.

21:23.044 --> 21:25.047
And, I mean, there's some real tough times for Eleanor.

21:25.087 --> 21:31.934
She decorates the Eleanor Franklin part, and there's that moment when Eleanor just starts crying because she feels that none of this is my own.

21:32.775 --> 21:36.960
And yet she gave him the confidence that made him what he was.

21:37.180 --> 21:40.624
So that is a critical component of who he is.

21:40.790 --> 21:48.421
I think maybe it's possible that her intrusiveness made it difficult for him to have the kind of intimacy that people always kept wanting with him.

21:49.222 --> 22:01.160
I don't really deal with this at great length, but perhaps just the guilt he might have felt when he was young about falling in love with anyone else besides his mother made him have to keep private anything else that wasn't okay with the mother.

22:02.201 --> 22:03.643
But still, she's a huge figure.

22:04.364 --> 22:09.632
And Eleanor, obviously the wife, you've got this incredibly interesting role with a wife who...

22:09.950 --> 22:20.398
not only plays the idealistic half to the pragmatic politician and is able to argue for making sure that the war is a vehicle for social reform as well as

22:20.868 --> 22:23.231
be able to beat the Axis powers.

22:24.233 --> 22:25.915
But she's his conscience.

22:25.955 --> 22:28.178
She's his eyes and ears traveling around the country.

22:28.198 --> 22:29.320
She's his best reporter.

22:30.361 --> 22:32.825
That was very interesting.

22:32.845 --> 22:33.486
I loved it.

22:33.506 --> 22:34.888
The man is physically unable to dwell.

22:34.908 --> 22:35.829
That's right.

22:35.849 --> 22:37.191
There's somebody you can trust.

22:37.271 --> 22:37.772
That's right.

22:37.932 --> 22:38.493
That's right.

22:39.013 --> 22:41.156
And how many presidents really have someone?

22:41.176 --> 22:45.002
I mean, he had Harry Hopkins on the foreign policy side eventually and Eleanor at home.

22:45.823 --> 22:48.867
And as one of, I think it was Francis Perkins said,

22:49.133 --> 22:52.242
What she brought back was not just facts, but insights.

22:52.684 --> 22:59.644
And she could tell him, this program's not working and this is wrong in a way that so few people could have done that with a president.

23:00.206 --> 23:02.974
And he really understood things because of her.

23:03.123 --> 23:04.866
And those tricks she took are amazing.

23:04.886 --> 23:15.925
And when you think of her, you know, suddenly, I mean, my favorite story is that one where the migrant worker in his shack suddenly looks up without surprise after she's trekked over in the mud and said, oh, hello, Mrs. Roosevelt.

23:16.346 --> 23:21.435
You know, today Hillary would be followed by 700 reporters and it wouldn't work.

23:22.023 --> 23:24.211
But then, of course, you have the role of the secretary.

23:24.231 --> 23:28.787
You know, we obviously know throughout history how important secretaries can be to working men.

23:29.148 --> 23:31.276
Well, you quote her.

23:32.721 --> 23:33.805
She just blew a quote.

23:34.088 --> 23:37.211
What a thing to have somebody who knows precisely what you want to say in a letter.

23:37.371 --> 23:39.793
Exactly, exactly.

23:40.314 --> 23:48.881
She said she studied his style of thinking and writing well enough that she could become him in it, certainly.

23:49.122 --> 23:59.751
And also, I mean, the part I found so important was her understanding when he was grouchy during the day, you know, and arranging those poker games at night so that he could relax without him even knowing.

23:59.771 --> 24:01.513
She'd just say, here they all are to play poker.

24:01.747 --> 24:04.292
I mean, that shows you really know your boss well.

24:04.752 --> 24:14.009
Or, you know, being willing, as people said, you know, he's in the middle of some really important meeting, and she makes him put a sweater on because he's cold, or he's getting a cold, or take his medicine, or she paid his bills.

24:14.069 --> 24:19.519
She sent the draperies out for dry cleaning, and, you know, at springtime, she gave the kids their allowances.

24:19.860 --> 24:23.907
I mean, she really was playing the role of the wife when Eleanor traveled.

24:26.418 --> 24:28.200
And then, of course, there's the daughter, but go ahead.

24:28.460 --> 24:32.523
Give me a comment on the daughter.

24:32.944 --> 24:48.998
Well, what I found so interesting about that was here's a daughter who, I guess, all of her life as a child had wanted to be close to her father and found politics, a force that took her away from her father.

24:49.018 --> 24:56.104
I mean, she has that image of childhood standing out, you know, of wanting to be in that smoke-filled room with her father and all those men and not being allowed in.

24:56.557 --> 25:06.146
And in part, maybe that sense of estrangement is what drew her closer to her mother, and her mother had eventually confided in her, the story of Lucy Mercer.

25:06.607 --> 25:15.115
And you can see in most of the story, until she actually moves into the White House, that it's the mother-daughter relationship that's closer than the father-daughter relationship.

25:15.475 --> 25:24.664
And even during that whole time when Anna's so mad that she doesn't get to go to the Turan conference, and John Bodiger is there, and... Oh, no, I guess it's the... I forget now which one.

25:24.724 --> 25:25.585
I think it is Turan.

25:25.868 --> 25:31.595
And she feels like her brothers have gotten better chances than she, and she commiserates with her mother because the mother didn't go either.

25:31.956 --> 25:46.955
But then when she finally gets to the White House and is able to give her father that gossip, I mean, she says in her letter to Johnny Bottiger, her husband, that the turning point came when she was able to just sort of gossip with him about the fact that Franklin Jr.

25:47.036 --> 25:48.197
was...

25:48.380 --> 25:56.483
was having a crush on Kay Summersbee, the woman that Eisenhower was with, and then FDR confides in her that he thinks Eisenhower is having an affair with Kay Summersbee.

25:56.603 --> 25:59.872
I mean, you just love these moments that you would never find if you didn't have those letters.

26:00.293 --> 26:01.697
And I was lucky enough, again, that

26:01.930 --> 26:17.851
Because I had interviewed early on Eleanor Seagraves, Anna's oldest daughter, she's the one that gave me access to all the private material at the library that hasn't been used of the Baudigar letters and of Anna's unpublished material, so that you could get inside Anna's head as much as possible with documentation.

26:17.871 --> 26:23.699
Are there any things that are still embargoed or is most of the material pretty much available?

26:23.719 --> 26:25.001
I would say most of it's available.

26:25.021 --> 26:26.723
Every now and then when you're in a file,

26:26.703 --> 26:30.310
They'll have a colored slick that says, you know, this thing is not here.

26:31.071 --> 26:32.534
So you don't even know why it's not there.

26:32.914 --> 26:37.222
But in that library, it's probably more than many others because it's the oldest one.

26:37.543 --> 26:43.213
Although Hoover now has one too, but I think most of it is also does.

26:43.233 --> 26:43.834
But it's not.

26:43.874 --> 26:50.787
But what happens is in order to have permission to use it, you have to get... What happens is people have given over their materials to the library.

26:51.391 --> 26:57.447
And you can read it, but if you want to quote from it, you have to get permission from the owners of it, and that's not the library often.

26:57.748 --> 27:04.506
So that's why I had to go to Harold Vicki's son and had to go to True to Lash, Joe's wife, to the Joe Lash Library.

27:04.840 --> 27:24.537
and um and to add his children to get all that material i had to do that at columbia with an oral history oh yeah and surprisingly enough the guy that owned it was the guy who did the interview oh no kidding yeah that can happen sometimes it was crazy yeah i know i didn't even realize until the last couple months that all of this took you know had to happen i thought it was in the library

27:24.753 --> 27:25.534
You could use it.

27:25.955 --> 27:27.096
Oh, no.

27:27.177 --> 27:29.380
So luckily I had known all these people.

27:29.420 --> 27:32.825
But these oral histories are wonderful, I think, because you use it.

27:32.845 --> 27:39.715
I'll tell you, Francis Perkins' Oral History at Columbia, it's like eight volumes, more than a thousand pages.

27:39.855 --> 27:41.157
Amazing stuff that's in it.

27:41.177 --> 27:42.099
Oh, it's wonderful.

27:42.159 --> 27:43.901
What a great idea.

27:43.921 --> 27:44.923
Oh, yeah, you really do.

27:45.344 --> 27:48.268
I mean, and then I used all the ones that were relevant in the Roosevelt Library.

27:48.588 --> 27:53.055
I mean, because what happens is somebody with, what you do is once you know you're going to have a certain...

27:53.272 --> 28:21.118
situation like the draft or land lease or you know one of the struggles over civil rights or women in the factory then all these oral histories will somebody will have been with Eleanor Franklin when one of those things came up and it's the only way you're going to be able to get often if you don't have a letter or a diary entry what they're feeling about a certain issue and they were there you know and even if it's sometimes you know they mix up things it's still it's a wonderful for us let's let's integrate this with with

28:21.318 --> 28:25.263
the other books that you've done.

28:25.323 --> 28:30.088
Clearly there's a pattern here, and there's a focus of interest.

28:30.108 --> 28:32.551
Maybe tell me a little about what you've written.

28:32.651 --> 28:37.597
I'm sure it's not coincidental that you've written about the families and the free Democrat president.

28:37.637 --> 28:44.085
Well, Nixon would be interesting to write about if I had been able to interview him.

28:45.112 --> 28:50.118
I mean, in fact, at one point... Oh, what's his name?

28:50.158 --> 28:51.119
Pat Buchanan, right?

28:51.139 --> 28:51.320
Yeah.

28:51.580 --> 28:55.685
Pat Buchanan and I were on a White House Dallas Commission together and got to know each other a little bit.

28:55.705 --> 28:59.329
And long ago, you know, he said he'd put in a word with the Nixon people.

28:59.850 --> 29:06.358
But I think probably that, you know, the fact that my husband had worked for Kennedy in the Nixon campaign, it wasn't going to be me he was going to talk to.

29:06.798 --> 29:11.524
But I think there's probably, you know, in addition to that...

29:11.757 --> 29:16.123
I think part of it was having gotten to know Lyndon Johnson when I was young.

29:17.044 --> 29:17.866
There's my husband.

29:17.906 --> 29:18.807
Hello.

29:19.928 --> 29:20.910
Did you do it already?

29:22.071 --> 29:22.953
All right.

29:23.053 --> 29:23.834
How are you?

29:23.854 --> 29:25.797
This is Dick Goodwin.

29:25.997 --> 29:28.420
This is Dickie Watley.

29:28.440 --> 29:29.902
That's right.

29:30.103 --> 29:34.889
So you did it already.

29:34.969 --> 29:40.397
I think in some ways the experience of having

29:40.968 --> 29:45.214
the incredible fortune of getting to know Lyndon Johnson.

29:45.394 --> 29:48.398
Okay, that's right.

29:48.418 --> 29:52.263
I mean, what happened is that I ended up being a White House fellow assigned to the White House.

29:52.583 --> 30:01.255
I'd been involved in the anti-war movement, so it became sort of a controversy that an anti-war person had been assigned to work in the White House House program.

30:01.572 --> 30:08.420
And instead of kicking me out of the program, which people thought he would, Johnson said, just have her come down here for a year, and if I can't win her over, no one can or something.

30:08.861 --> 30:22.117
So in the end, it drew him, in a certain sense, into a relationship with me where I spent my White House fellow a year in Washington, and I ended up staying on the White House staff for him for six months, and then I helped him on his memoirs over the next five years.

30:22.137 --> 30:28.525
While I started teaching at Harvard, I went to the ranch summers, Christmas vacations, and about every third weekend or so.

30:28.910 --> 30:32.455
So I was only 24, 25, 26 at the time.

30:33.036 --> 30:38.284
And I saw him not at the height of his power, but really in that vulnerable last stage of his life.

30:38.985 --> 30:45.816
And it meant he talked to me privately in a way that he never would have had time or inclination to do, I think, if it had been at the height of his power.

30:46.356 --> 30:56.672
But I think looking back on it now, because I was able to wake up in the morning and find him needing to talk to me at 5.30 or...

30:56.787 --> 31:17.479
or his asking me to sit outside his room when he had a nap because he was lonely and he wanted to know if somebody was there, it made me see the private side of a figure and not just think of them as presidents without inner turmoil, troubles, needs, wants, and desires that I probably brought with me to my book on him and the Kennedys.

31:17.499 --> 31:20.123
That's basically the focus of yours.

31:20.143 --> 31:20.844
That's right.

31:21.365 --> 31:22.086
So that I think...

31:22.420 --> 31:24.943
And I don't know that I fully... Very relevant.

31:24.963 --> 31:26.144
Yeah, I guess, I think so.

31:26.164 --> 31:34.694
I mean, I think if you, you know, there would be times even with Johnson when suddenly I remember being in his study one day and he had all the presidential bibliography in his study.

31:34.714 --> 31:36.736
He had all these books on presidents, chronological.

31:36.756 --> 31:38.738
And then suddenly I went, oh my God, he's one of them.

31:39.339 --> 31:44.505
And then I sort of got chilled back in a certain minute and thinking, how can I be so friendly with him?

31:44.705 --> 31:45.746
You know, he's a president.

31:45.766 --> 31:46.787
Now this was in Texas?

31:46.928 --> 31:49.591
This was in Texas when I'm 24 years old or something.

31:50.331 --> 31:50.892
But then...

31:51.175 --> 31:52.057
He was at the ranch.

31:52.337 --> 31:53.199
He was at the ranch.

31:53.219 --> 31:55.804
He had it in his study there when he had all these books.

31:56.164 --> 31:58.829
Because normally your feeling is that there's something distant.

31:58.849 --> 32:00.533
You've read about these presidents all your life.

32:01.194 --> 32:06.163
And it would be hard to approach them and try to find out what they're feeling at certain times.

32:06.397 --> 32:19.113
But because, except for those few moments when I'd be brought up short and realize, oh my God, I'm just talking to him relaxably as if he's my friend, and he's one of them, most of my experience was to just know him as a private person.

32:19.133 --> 32:20.535
So it didn't intimidate you?

32:20.555 --> 32:21.536
No, it didn't.

32:21.556 --> 32:24.660
And I think it was partly because I was so young it didn't intimidate me.

32:24.680 --> 32:26.242
You just sort of think, oh, this is natural.

32:26.302 --> 32:29.526
But looking back on it now, I realize how special it was.

32:29.946 --> 32:34.412
And I do think it just allowed me, when I got into the later books, to know that

32:34.477 --> 32:40.846
Other people knew him like I knew Johnson, and I'm going to find those people, and they can tell me what's happening somehow.

32:41.187 --> 32:43.991
And if that hadn't happened, I don't know that my focus would have been the same.

32:44.011 --> 32:45.713
I was originally a political scientist.

32:45.773 --> 32:48.477
I got my PhD in political science from Hawkins.

32:48.497 --> 32:49.278
Where are you from?

32:49.458 --> 32:51.962
From Long Island, New York.

32:52.094 --> 32:55.439
So I think that was important.

32:55.559 --> 32:58.823
I think that just made me want to know these people.

32:58.903 --> 33:02.528
I'm sure the scientists must have a biographical thing that they can say.

33:02.548 --> 33:03.590
Yeah, I'm sure they do.

33:03.690 --> 33:09.418
I don't want to ask you all these questions that they can do.

33:10.099 --> 33:17.629
When you start a book, do you bring any kind of preconceptions into it, any baggage, any...

33:18.115 --> 33:21.400
Clearly, you wouldn't write about somebody you didn't like, I don't think.

33:21.741 --> 33:25.567
You call it a sympathetic... Well, it's interesting.

33:25.607 --> 33:26.388
I've thought about that.

33:26.409 --> 33:29.574
I mean, I think I know how long it takes me to write these books.

33:29.594 --> 33:34.942
I mean, embarrassingly, this one takes me longer to write than it took the war to be fought.

33:35.664 --> 33:36.465
It took six years.

33:36.765 --> 33:40.031
It would be hard to spend that much time.

33:40.051 --> 33:43.777
And you really do feel there are times when I would be talking to these people during the day.

33:43.797 --> 33:43.937
I mean,

33:44.153 --> 33:45.895
They're alive for you.

33:45.995 --> 33:47.096
They are totally alive.

33:47.156 --> 33:53.062
I mean, Franklin, Eleanor, Harry, Anna, you know, especially because I had this research assistant who worked with me the whole time through.

33:53.122 --> 33:55.585
We would talk about them as if this is what they've done today.

33:56.285 --> 33:58.528
That's right, exactly.

33:58.908 --> 34:00.570
So that it would be really hard.

34:00.710 --> 34:12.642
I mean, it makes it much more pleasant to have this basic respect and affection for these people, even though there are times when you're going to criticize them, times when they fail, like all human beings.

34:13.060 --> 34:17.987
I don't know what it would be like to suppose you did something on somebody like Hitler or Stalin.

34:18.127 --> 34:24.175
I suspect the fascination of that kind of large evil would sustain you.

34:24.215 --> 34:30.624
What I'd have a hard time doing would be to write about somebody who was not that large and who I just disliked.

34:31.264 --> 34:33.708
I mean, that would be horrible because they do affect your life.

34:33.768 --> 34:36.992
I mean, you know, there's something about sometimes watching Eleanor

34:37.428 --> 34:44.256
able to reinvent herself when she had to and change after that affair take place to become a different person to go out more.

34:44.696 --> 34:58.251
When I was worrying about the fact that my kids were reaching the age where they were all going to be going off to college, we just have one left at home, I kept thinking, well, I'll figure something out to do, you know, beyond staying home and just writing, or maybe I will be able to, because Eleanor was able to do it.

34:59.172 --> 35:00.674
They do hit you in certain ways.

35:01.174 --> 35:02.676
Certainly when I was doing the Kennedy book,

35:02.960 --> 35:04.462
which was about a family.

35:04.942 --> 35:14.132
There would be times when my kids were little at that point, and I would try and import the ritual from the Kennedy book into my kids' lives, like we'd try to have dinner conversations at night.

35:14.152 --> 35:15.053
It never seemed to work.

35:15.414 --> 35:22.261
One time my kids were in camp, and Rose used to write these incredibly long political letters to her kids at camp, Joe and Jack, when they were like seven and eight.

35:22.301 --> 35:23.222
My kids were the same age.

35:23.603 --> 35:28.028
I'd write them about Oliver North and Rand Contrahealing, and they'd say, Mom, what's happened to you?

35:29.009 --> 35:30.731
So it does affect you.

35:30.871 --> 35:32.933
I mean, so that's why, at least for me,

35:33.318 --> 35:43.239
since you're going to be living with these people day in and day out for a long time, it ennobles your life if they're larger and people that you respect so much that you want to empathize with them.

35:43.399 --> 35:46.686
I mean, I've talked to David McCullough and Justin Kaplan.

35:47.003 --> 35:59.578
I think he was going to do Picasso or something.

35:59.898 --> 36:06.927
He wrote me the most wonderful, I mean, he's such a wonderful man.

36:07.327 --> 36:12.353
He not only gave a blurb to the book, but he wrote me a letter after the blurb.

36:12.620 --> 36:21.010
And he just said he wanted me to know that it made him feel larger and taller to be part of the same Narrative Historical Guild as I was.

36:21.090 --> 36:21.450
Wow.

36:22.352 --> 36:23.132
Isn't that nice?

36:23.373 --> 36:24.915
He's one of my dear friends.

36:24.935 --> 36:25.756
Oh, yeah, I know.

36:25.796 --> 36:26.997
Two quick questions.

36:27.017 --> 36:30.181
So there's a pattern in your work.

36:30.261 --> 36:30.902
What's next?

36:31.562 --> 36:35.387
Well, Dick and I are going to do a book together on presidential decisions.

36:35.536 --> 36:42.082
And what it's going to do is to take maybe 15 decisions and tell each one's story from the inside of the president.

36:42.162 --> 36:49.329
Each one will tell a different power, like Truman firing MacArthur, Johnson getting civil rights through the Congress, Lincoln at Fort Sumter.

36:49.349 --> 36:50.911
It really is.

36:51.451 --> 36:51.852
I know.

36:52.072 --> 36:54.714
He knows that internal power mechanism.

36:54.734 --> 36:57.097
And I've spent a lot of time on the biographical side.

36:57.457 --> 36:59.799
And then we're hoping it can become a college textbook.

36:59.819 --> 37:00.940
Yes, I'll be home.

37:01.361 --> 37:03.923
I'll be back very soon.

37:04.038 --> 37:10.078
The course I taught on the presidency at Harvard, I taught that way.

37:10.560 --> 37:14.453
It just means that instead of having to go through an analytical discussion of the powers,

37:14.686 --> 37:18.955
You illustrate a different power by really being inside the president at that time.

37:19.075 --> 37:21.961
Is it going to be 20th century or are you going to go back?

37:21.981 --> 37:23.444
I think we're going to go back.

37:23.464 --> 37:25.188
We're going to start with an opening chapter.

37:25.508 --> 37:28.815
We have to really focus on it fully now that this one is over.

37:29.176 --> 37:34.467
An opening chapter on all the precedents that Washington set just by being there.

37:34.666 --> 37:43.296
And then we have to figure out Jefferson and the embargo, maybe Jackson and the Indians or the bank, Lincoln and Fort Sumter.

37:43.376 --> 37:47.140
Oh, no, no, no.

37:47.881 --> 37:55.289
No, it'll be, I mean, what I'm hoping is it'll be like a biography of the presidency told through these major decisions to change the office.

37:55.469 --> 37:58.092
So it was actually not our idea.

37:58.375 --> 38:09.794
the man who was then the head of Harper Collins now, had approached me with it about six years ago, but then I started this book, and then after we finished this one, we started talking about, well, why don't we do this?

38:10.055 --> 38:16.766
And then just one, because you mentioned your husband, and I think maybe we can probably get a paragraph at the bottom of the story.

38:16.786 --> 38:20.232
These are very interesting times in the Goodwin family, and you might just...

38:20.617 --> 38:23.621
And you also mentioned that maybe you're out in California.

38:24.302 --> 38:28.529
Well, it's so, you know... Can you give us an opportunity to bring... I understand.

38:28.549 --> 38:32.154
I mean, what's coming together now, which is total coincidence.

38:32.174 --> 38:38.123
I mean, people have been teasing us that this movie, in fact, the premiere came out on Monday and I was on the Today Show that Monday morning.

38:38.143 --> 38:39.826
That's the first day of my book tour.

38:39.846 --> 38:44.352
It's just that it took me so long to finish my book and it took him so long to make the movie that they just happened to come out.

38:44.372 --> 38:45.694
Is that what was his role in the movie?

38:45.995 --> 38:46.776
It's about him.

38:46.891 --> 38:51.275
He wrote a book called Remembering America.

38:52.016 --> 39:03.807
His first job after being a law clerk for Justice Frankfurter, before he went to work for John Kennedy as a speechwriter, his first job was to be the congressional investigator that ended up breaking this quiz show scandal.

39:04.867 --> 39:12.054
He wrote a chapter in his memoir about his being a speechwriter for John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson and Bobby and everything that just included this.

39:12.074 --> 39:13.255
That's what was picked up.

39:13.295 --> 39:16.358
It was just a small chapter in his book on the 60s

39:16.692 --> 39:17.834
and made into a movie.

39:17.854 --> 39:24.944
And in his chapter, it has the three-person drama that's in the movie Charles Van Doren, who's played by Ralph Kahn.

39:24.964 --> 39:26.967
That's exactly what a... That's right, yeah.

39:27.067 --> 39:27.948
Oh, right you see it.

39:28.108 --> 39:29.571
It's such a wonderful movie.

39:29.611 --> 39:31.794
I mean, I've never seen such terrific reviews.

39:31.914 --> 39:35.779
I mean, it's really, they're saying already... I understand it's very sympathetic to Mr. Van Doren.

39:36.120 --> 39:43.651
Yeah, I mean, what Redford did so well in the movie was to be sympathetic to all the characters and not diminish one to raise up another.

39:43.811 --> 39:45.954
So every actor does an incredible job.

39:46.014 --> 39:46.615
I mean, it's really...

39:47.000 --> 39:59.360
And then the other thing that's happening at the same time is there's a documentary on baseball that's coming out that Ken Burns is doing that I'm involved in because he needed an irrational female fan.

40:01.003 --> 40:06.291
So the nice part for me is that he's made it a father-daughter relationship, and my father died a long time ago.

40:06.271 --> 40:09.196
My father's pictures of my father will actually be in this film.

40:09.216 --> 40:10.638
So it makes him come back.

40:10.798 --> 40:13.483
They even have his old name, Michael Francis, Elowish's turn.

40:13.663 --> 40:15.807
How are you responding to this baseball thing?

40:16.147 --> 40:16.968
The strike?

40:16.988 --> 40:19.012
Well, that's the strike.

40:19.092 --> 40:20.494
I mean, it's the determination.

40:20.514 --> 40:21.376
Oh, it's terrible.

40:21.516 --> 40:21.856
I know.

40:21.876 --> 40:24.140
I mean, it's just... It really is.

40:24.240 --> 40:28.988
I mean, it's just... For both those owners and the players to have that kind of...

40:29.204 --> 40:31.947
Lack of regard for... You know what I say?

40:31.967 --> 40:38.813
I say, and nobody has mentioned this, this is further evidence of just how tragic that that was about Jamadi was.

40:39.854 --> 40:40.935
I agree with you.

40:41.055 --> 40:42.437
I agree with you.

40:42.837 --> 40:44.999
He would have headed this off so long ago.

40:45.019 --> 40:46.040
I think that's right.

40:46.060 --> 40:46.621
No, I think that's right.

40:46.641 --> 40:49.003
But he allowed these owners to become lenigate owners.

40:49.063 --> 40:49.524
That's right.

40:49.644 --> 40:51.586
And I just think it never would have happened.

40:51.626 --> 40:52.326
No, I agree.

40:52.507 --> 40:55.009
Maybe like the black spots have had to happen at one point.

40:54.989 --> 40:58.053
So anyway, just the last thing on all this stuff coming together.

40:58.093 --> 41:06.664
So what happened is they had a screening of the baseball premiere in Washington at the National Theater just past Saturday.

41:07.065 --> 41:10.129
And then President Clinton had a picnic afterwards at the White House.

41:10.569 --> 41:15.355
So where all these weird things come together, we went down and President Clinton came in.

41:15.395 --> 41:16.337
They played Hail to the Chief.

41:16.357 --> 41:17.418
He came into the screening.

41:18.019 --> 41:22.144
And I was standing on the aisle because I had to give a talk at this thing.

41:22.394 --> 41:24.778
and he came over and he shook my hand and he said, I love your book.

41:25.119 --> 41:45.617
What was the most wonderful thing about that was mainly, not so much only that, but my 16-year-old son was standing next to me, and he's doing this, he's there with, meanwhile, there's Kirk Blood is there, and the old guy from the Negro League, and all these baseball players, so to have him share in that moment, and then he was able to go to the premiere of the baseball, I mean, of Dick's movie two nights later, so.

41:45.749 --> 41:49.090
Hey, Paul, thank you so much for that series.

41:49.291 --> 41:52.873
It is so wonderful.
