00:03.642 --> 00:28.232
I'm amazed that it took you three or four countries into the tour to decide whether or not you were writing a book.

00:29.073 --> 00:30.395
Well, I didn't know.

00:31.117 --> 00:33.461
I mean, it's like writing a novel.

00:33.741 --> 00:40.854
I sometimes have written two or three chapters of a novel or more and abandoned it.

00:40.874 --> 00:45.022
And I think, is this a short story?

00:45.042 --> 00:45.382
Is it a novella?

00:45.403 --> 00:48.147
Is it a novel or is it nothing?

00:48.167 --> 00:51.233
And I have abandoned a lot of things.

00:51.567 --> 01:01.371
And I've abandoned trips too.

01:01.391 --> 01:04.398
About 1985, 84, 85, I went to Africa.

01:04.418 --> 01:07.084
I was going to write a long thing about Africa.

01:07.104 --> 01:07.706
I was traveling around Africa.

01:07.726 --> 01:08.047
I went to Kenya.

01:08.067 --> 01:08.648
Why did you abandon that one?

01:09.033 --> 01:11.317
Difficult and depressing.

01:11.337 --> 01:13.380
It was just very hard to get visas.

01:13.400 --> 01:15.945
There was fighting in Uganda.

01:16.465 --> 01:20.372
It was a very, very depressing story.

01:20.392 --> 01:25.661
I thought, someday I'll do it, but there were places I simply couldn't go.

01:25.681 --> 01:33.734
I went to Kenya, I went to Uganda, I went to Tanzania, and I thought, I'm going to leave this for later.

01:34.035 --> 01:34.516
I can't do it.

01:34.536 --> 01:35.277
I can't do it.

01:36.539 --> 01:37.487
I abandoned it.

01:37.749 --> 01:41.098
And it was an expensive abandonment too because it's pretty far.

01:42.091 --> 02:06.748
but i realized that there was that i couldn't do it that it that it wasn't a trip so therefore it couldn't be a book um do you find that this is the seventh travel book it depends when we're talking about uh anthologies or how long the book is it's the sixth long travel book i also wrote uh to the ends of the earth which is not an anthology i wrote um

02:07.353 --> 02:14.983
A little book about Patagonia and a little book about going down the Yangtze.

02:15.003 --> 02:17.185
Do you get jaded after a while?

02:17.366 --> 02:19.208
I don't get jaded in travel.

02:19.408 --> 02:21.090
I don't get bored with travel.

02:21.191 --> 02:24.435
I think life is complicated.

02:24.455 --> 02:28.720
I find it really hard to run my life somehow.

02:29.307 --> 02:40.448
and so you know to be away for a long time is very inconvenient it's difficult on a marriage it's difficult on a household it's difficult on children

02:41.643 --> 02:46.149
But personally, I find travel still very, very stimulating.

02:46.169 --> 02:48.272
And I stay in a pretty lousy hotel.

02:48.293 --> 02:56.825
The only way to write about it is to write about lousy... I mean, to stay in a lousy hotel, not to stay in a luxury hotel.

02:56.845 --> 02:57.806
I don't have a problem with that.

02:57.966 --> 02:59.509
As a matter of fact, I kind of like it.

02:59.529 --> 03:05.697
I kind of like the challenge of staying in a third-rate place and saving a lot of money and moving on.

03:06.659 --> 03:07.520
I still can't.

03:07.640 --> 03:08.882
I mean, about a month ago...

03:09.267 --> 03:16.244
I went on a bike trip alone and went camping from across the big island of Hawaii.

03:17.327 --> 03:20.053
And people said, what are you doing?

03:20.074 --> 03:21.918
I said, well, I want to go up Mount Mauna Kea Volcano.

03:21.938 --> 03:22.720
There are some observatories there.

03:23.206 --> 03:26.510
How are you doing?

03:26.790 --> 03:29.033
I had a tent.

03:29.453 --> 03:29.994
I had water.

03:30.014 --> 03:30.335
I had food.

03:30.635 --> 03:31.997
I loved it.

03:32.017 --> 03:35.821
It was a kind of Boy Scout experience.

03:35.841 --> 03:39.065
Do you have to keep physically in shape for this?

03:39.085 --> 03:41.668
You can't be in bad shape.

03:41.688 --> 03:43.010
You have to be in pretty good shape.

03:43.030 --> 03:49.197
I think I'm in pretty good shape.

03:49.237 --> 03:49.537
I do too.

03:49.557 --> 03:50.679
You said you ride lights.

03:51.139 --> 03:52.521
Oh, my syndicate, yeah.

03:53.530 --> 04:00.785
You have to be in good shape to travel.

04:01.286 --> 04:14.492
You have to be really emotionally and physically in the best shape possible.

04:15.130 --> 04:17.575
Travel is an ordeal or it's a misery.

04:17.695 --> 04:30.381
Because if you think that if you get easily depressed, if you get discouraged, if you had something bad happen to you, if you've got some kind of health problem, travel is the worst thing to do.

04:30.421 --> 04:32.786
Travel doesn't cure you.

04:32.986 --> 04:33.828
It actually tests you.

04:34.148 --> 04:35.451
And so...

04:35.431 --> 04:39.178
Some people go away thinking, oh, I'll go away, maybe I'll feel better.

04:39.198 --> 04:43.907
They go away and they come back feeling much worse.

04:43.988 --> 04:48.737
You say towards the end of this book that this was an unusual trip and that it was over.

04:50.039 --> 04:54.368
You didn't feel like, you felt like you'd go back and do it again.

04:54.388 --> 04:55.650
Yeah, because there are a lot of books...

04:55.630 --> 05:06.647
I think that's a reflection on the complexity and density of the Mediterranean and on the fact that things change a lot.

05:06.728 --> 05:08.711
Israel is slightly different since I left it.

05:08.731 --> 05:10.454
Albania is different.

05:10.474 --> 05:12.677
Croatia is different.

05:13.636 --> 05:15.838
I'd like to go.

05:15.959 --> 05:17.460
I didn't go to Algeria.

05:17.480 --> 05:28.072
I really would like to go to Algeria a lot, but it's a dangerous, horrible place.

05:28.092 --> 05:31.516
And so... And recently, you know, you read the papers yesterday and today about Algeria.

05:31.616 --> 05:38.243
And you point out, because not only Algeria is in the news because they've been bombing Paris, but when they were bombing themselves...

05:38.594 --> 05:44.560
40,000 people have died there.

05:45.100 --> 05:55.650
You said that very early in the book, and also the fact that they seem to have a big background policy of killing apologists.

05:55.670 --> 05:58.053
Yeah, and they kill them in traffic.

05:58.073 --> 06:03.338
They walk through traffic shooting in cars, and then it's easy to escape.

06:03.818 --> 06:06.301
If you're on foot and the person you shoot is in a car that's jammed in traffic.

06:06.321 --> 06:07.622
So you wisely decided to screw in Algeria.

06:08.176 --> 06:19.631
Yeah, unfortunately.

06:19.832 --> 06:21.073
And Lebanon.

06:21.954 --> 06:32.509
So if I went back, I'd go to all the places I didn't go, Lebanon and Algeria, and then a lot of places that had changed.

06:32.529 --> 06:33.971
You also described the Mediterranean as kind of like going to museums.

06:33.991 --> 06:34.511
I like that.

06:34.531 --> 06:37.255
It's like going to museums and sometimes looking at the treasures and other times looking out the window.

06:38.990 --> 07:04.828
Do you undertake a project like this with expectations that will ultimately emerge having any kind of focus for you as a very serendipitous?

07:04.848 --> 07:05.389
Serendipitous, exceptional.

07:05.409 --> 07:06.571
But serendipitous, and so you need terrific luck to do it.

07:06.591 --> 07:07.512
But also, I make a great effort to meet people

07:07.913 --> 07:27.694
but to go to places and i do a lot of planning beforehand in order for that to be possible for example going to the town where uh in aleano where price stopped at eboli takes place it's very slightly not on most maps finding it finding a way of getting

07:28.332 --> 07:37.810
meeting people like Nagib Mahfouz or Paul Bowles.

07:37.830 --> 07:42.859
I thought a lot about an event, how to meet them, what to say when, you know, plant that kind of plant.

07:42.940 --> 07:46.607
The rest of it, planting where to stay, there's no planting there.

07:46.627 --> 07:47.288
I never made onward reservations.

07:47.308 --> 07:48.450
That's kind of fun.

07:49.358 --> 08:02.473
That's a serendipitous part.

08:02.493 --> 08:05.277
Any particularly scary moments?

08:06.638 --> 08:10.663
Any war zone makes you anxious, except that it was the evidence of the war rather than the war itself.

08:11.204 --> 08:13.706
The war had kind of come and gone.

08:13.726 --> 08:15.889
The Serbian lines were about

08:16.105 --> 08:38.367
say 10 miles inland in some places so i was on the right i was on the side of the lines that there wasn't any fighting but there had been fighting before i got there and when i left the fighting started up so i was lucky i got into a little window in some places

08:38.347 --> 08:57.483
Even going from Damascus to Jerusalem, when I went and crossing, because I really wanted to go by land.

08:58.604 --> 09:03.988
I didn't want to fly from one country to another in the Middle East.

09:04.008 --> 09:04.989
I wanted to go, you know, bounce along and do it.

09:05.009 --> 09:05.670
And I found that I could do that.

09:05.690 --> 09:07.131
I went from Damascus to Jordan and Jordan to Israel all by land.

09:07.151 --> 09:07.511
That was pleasant.

09:07.531 --> 09:08.252
So you also thought I was in danger.

09:08.840 --> 09:33.613
No, I didn't feel in danger.

09:33.633 --> 09:34.113
I was cautious about it.

09:34.133 --> 09:36.116
When I was in Turkey, I was near places where there was trouble, but I kind of stayed away from it.

09:36.136 --> 09:36.957
Are there any epiphanous moments for you?

09:37.814 --> 09:48.489
Like you mentioned, there was three countries before you, you still hadn't decided whether or not they'd be important.

09:49.733 --> 09:50.335
That's a good question.

09:50.355 --> 09:51.418
My epiphanous movement actually was

09:52.124 --> 10:02.244
One was, I mentioned in the book, Albania, where it really is horrible.

10:02.684 --> 10:06.351
When I arrived there, it was terrible.

10:06.372 --> 10:09.618
I just started arriving, and it's really one of the most horrendous-looking countries I've ever seen.

10:09.638 --> 10:13.706
There's nothing works, nothing looks, a road doesn't look like a road, a bus doesn't just look like a bus.

10:13.726 --> 10:14.908
You know, I've lived in Nigeria and Uganda and places where

10:15.293 --> 10:35.243
you think things are going to go wrong but actually albania is beyond that and then a guy showing me said you get here get on this bus which is a horrible vehicle he said joe and i said do you have any money i said no he said yes this is a very very poor hunter where someone someone gives you something this is um

10:35.763 --> 10:46.418
That's a great experience, actually.

10:47.039 --> 10:52.026
That's a very moving, very moving experience.

10:52.046 --> 10:55.390
Someone actually handing you... Here, go ahead.

10:55.410 --> 10:59.156
Any guy younger than me, poor than me, he's not begging.

10:59.276 --> 10:59.897
He's giving.

10:59.917 --> 11:00.157
It's a gift.

11:00.177 --> 11:00.437
It really is.

11:00.457 --> 11:00.778
In a true sense.

11:00.798 --> 11:01.799
So, you know, a few of those takes you a long way.

11:01.819 --> 11:03.762
Sometimes when someone says something, I get a kind of quill, because I think...

11:05.092 --> 11:08.257
This is why I came.

11:08.277 --> 11:12.443
I came to hear this, to see that.

11:12.463 --> 11:26.523
And then sometimes when things are working well, like, got on a train in Venom, got on a train in Trieste, got on a train in Trieste, got off, changed trains in Slovenia.

11:26.543 --> 11:29.147
And then I thought, I'd gone here by looking at a map.

11:29.167 --> 11:29.968
I figured out that there was a line.

11:30.472 --> 11:33.496
And here I am, this thing is working.

11:33.516 --> 11:38.341
And I just was there, now I'm going there, and tonight I'll be there.

11:38.622 --> 11:48.193
And when it all is kind of clicking, and I'm alone, I'm thinking, this is what I hoped would happen, and it's happening.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.636
You know what I mean?

11:50.656 --> 11:51.737
And so you think, it seems to be working.

11:51.757 --> 11:53.479
Now you mentioned also that every night you work.

11:54.540 --> 11:54.921
Yeah, every night.

11:54.941 --> 11:55.922
So you're recording...

11:57.083 --> 12:06.072
the dialogue as you remember it, the observations.

12:06.492 --> 12:08.034
Yeah.

12:08.294 --> 12:13.059
It is very strong and detailed, so these are really very visual books, I think.

12:13.259 --> 12:18.063
Yeah, but I keep a small notebook during the day.

12:18.083 --> 12:21.387
How many of those do you fill in, if that's likely?

12:21.407 --> 12:24.930
Well, I make little notes during the day, and then at night I expand them and make them into a travel narrative.

12:25.636 --> 12:48.570
A travel narrative, that's nice.

12:48.591 --> 12:50.013
So filling up the... I fill up a big notebook and then I photocopy it.

12:50.033 --> 12:50.614
Send it, keep it, send it on.

12:50.634 --> 12:52.076
So you don't carry it with you the whole way, you're just sending it on.

12:52.096 --> 12:52.436
Which is great.

12:52.456 --> 12:53.017
It's actually very worrying.

12:53.037 --> 12:53.538
If you write it longhand.

12:53.558 --> 12:54.079
If you lose your notebook.

12:54.099 --> 12:54.259
You bet.

12:54.863 --> 13:20.980
I can't tell you, I mean, there are very rare occasions where I've lost the tape.

13:21.000 --> 13:21.941
Unless you mindfully, you can't reconstruct it.

13:21.961 --> 13:22.462
You can't reconstruct it.

13:22.482 --> 13:23.644
I don't have a tape, so would you adjust yourself to that?

13:23.664 --> 13:24.044
Why is that?

13:24.064 --> 13:24.685
It makes people self-conscious.

13:25.711 --> 13:32.560
I mean, I'm answering questions.

13:35.123 --> 13:43.214
We're not having... We're having a conversation, but I know what the rules are.

13:43.234 --> 13:46.759
This is different from... You're meeting me casually.

13:48.601 --> 13:49.843
Let's say I didn't know you, and I met you in this restaurant.

13:50.303 --> 13:51.565
You said... You're writing a book, or whatever.

13:51.585 --> 13:52.026
You're a visitor.

13:52.046 --> 13:54.349
And you say, would you mind if I... That would kill the conversation.

13:54.369 --> 13:55.330
I mean... I want you to remember what I said.

13:57.301 --> 14:09.527
But I suppose I'm also, I would be guarded if there are questions, I suppose, that I could refuse to answer or not answer, because I know you're taking a book, or something like that.

14:09.547 --> 14:11.832
But anyway, an interview is different from a conversation.

14:11.852 --> 14:12.694
Absolutely.

14:13.163 --> 14:34.827
Two days ago, I was interviewing Leon Uris, you know?

14:34.847 --> 14:37.149
And he was getting on pretty well, and the machine was off, and he was telling me something very, very interesting.

14:37.169 --> 14:38.010
I said, gee, I wouldn't mind getting that.

14:38.030 --> 14:38.791
And he literally put his hand, oh, no.

14:38.811 --> 14:39.052
Who is this?

14:39.072 --> 14:39.272
Leon Uris.

14:39.292 --> 14:40.173
I always wanted to do an interview with him.

14:40.193 --> 14:42.175
But at that particular moment, when I went to reach for the tape recorder to get this, it was gone.

14:42.155 --> 14:49.804
he switched and became another person entirely.

14:49.824 --> 14:58.974
I mean, he's talking to me very frankly, when he sensed that I was interested in getting this for possible use in the piece, he absolutely changed.

14:58.994 --> 15:03.960
You know what, I mean, I don't think I've ever said this before, but I don't even show people a pencil or a pen.

15:03.980 --> 15:06.883
I don't even, I don't keep a pencil showing in my pocket.

15:06.903 --> 15:11.048
It's just so that, because if someone was looking at me and they were telling me something and they saw a pen, they'd think,

15:11.737 --> 15:15.408
this guy's gonna write that down.

15:15.428 --> 15:20.724
I mean, I don't want anyone to think about writing when they're talking to you.

15:20.744 --> 15:21.827
I don't want them just to think about the story.

15:21.847 --> 15:25.999
Well, when the guy recognizes you as a writer, he puts these silver titles in your books, and he asks you, are you writing about this?

15:26.654 --> 15:31.023
at that particular point?

15:31.043 --> 15:32.666
I denied it.

15:32.686 --> 15:32.866
Sorry?

15:33.387 --> 15:35.532
I denied it.

15:35.552 --> 15:37.656
That's why you said, I don't know.

15:37.676 --> 15:38.317
I don't know what he said.

15:38.598 --> 15:38.959
I'm not sure.

15:38.979 --> 15:39.880
I haven't decided yet.

15:40.021 --> 15:42.125
And you said, and that's true.

15:42.265 --> 15:43.107
That's why I asked that question earlier.

15:43.127 --> 15:44.089
You hadn't decided.

15:44.109 --> 15:44.730
I mean, you don't see anything.

15:44.710 --> 16:05.735
I don't mean to use the word dishonest, but you're not misleading the subject.

16:05.755 --> 16:05.975
No, no, no.

16:05.995 --> 16:07.697
But on the other hand, too, you don't want to... You don't want to... Yeah, go ahead.

16:07.778 --> 16:13.145
You don't want to watch it.

16:13.165 --> 16:21.215
Well, even if I were writing it, I probably wouldn't say.

16:21.635 --> 16:26.441
Well, that's a kind of a discouragement, isn't it?

16:26.461 --> 16:29.625
I'd say, anyway, well, I haven't written it yet, have I?

16:30.166 --> 16:31.488
And I don't know whether it would come up.

16:31.528 --> 16:34.191
But the point is, you know, if you say to someone, I'm going to write this,

16:36.196 --> 16:41.405
I think you're immediately making life a little hard for yourself.

16:41.505 --> 16:45.231
So I don't want to mislead people.

16:45.251 --> 16:58.272
On the other hand, if you go around, one of the worst things that can happen to anyone, I think, not just in writing but in life, is to have a recognizable face.

16:58.538 --> 17:02.913
to be famous.

17:03.053 --> 17:06.184
I think it's terrible.

17:06.284 --> 17:08.632
I mean, I'm so glad I'm famous.

17:08.652 --> 17:10.037
I'm so glad I can sit in a bus, sit in a train.

17:10.057 --> 17:11.181
If I was someone else,

17:12.005 --> 17:28.826
a familiar figure.

17:28.846 --> 17:29.867
There are some writers who are very familiar faces.

17:29.887 --> 17:30.428
Norman Mailer, for example.

17:30.448 --> 17:31.169
You could always spot Norman Mailer.

17:31.189 --> 17:31.809
As I have in a number of times.

17:31.829 --> 17:31.929
Yeah.

17:31.949 --> 17:32.991
At the airport and walking in, that's Norman Mailer.

17:33.011 --> 17:34.272
And you can see, I had breakfast last week with Leonard E. Moy.

17:34.292 --> 17:35.213
You should have seen, I mean, it's impossible.

17:35.234 --> 17:36.235
I don't see how the question can go out in public.

17:36.255 --> 17:36.876
Anyway, he may like it, though.

17:36.896 --> 17:37.536
Because some people do like him.

17:37.556 --> 17:37.877
Yeah, he's good.

17:37.897 --> 17:38.097
Thank you.

17:41.047 --> 17:57.811
I know Michael Crichton says it's impossible to go out to dinner.

17:57.831 --> 17:58.792
He says it really bothers him that he can't eat.

17:58.812 --> 17:59.653
He can't scratch his mouth.

17:59.673 --> 18:00.214
You're constantly watching.

18:00.234 --> 18:00.895
So Michael Crichton's travel book

18:01.347 --> 18:08.619
such as it is or would be, would be pretty different.

18:08.639 --> 18:09.460
Yeah.

18:09.480 --> 18:12.365
So I can go on writing it.

18:12.906 --> 18:13.387
No one's going to say.

18:13.407 --> 18:17.594
When I give them, when I assign them hotel register, they might recognize it.

18:17.834 --> 18:19.537
On the whole, people don't read very much.

18:19.557 --> 18:20.538
So I'm not recognizing it.

18:20.558 --> 18:21.420
And I usually put it down when I am.

18:21.440 --> 18:22.101
Anyway, I like anonymity.

18:22.121 --> 18:22.782
And writers, there's a little...

18:23.605 --> 18:43.949
as a rule, really aren't celebrities with a very few exceptions.

18:43.969 --> 18:44.149
Let's go.

18:44.169 --> 18:44.609
And I think it's good.

18:44.629 --> 18:46.111
I mean, I'm meeting Robert Massey here in about an hour and a half, right?

18:46.131 --> 18:46.712
He's going to know who he is.

18:46.732 --> 18:47.252
He's got a Pulitzer Prize.

18:47.272 --> 18:47.893
He's made some wonderful books.

18:47.913 --> 18:48.574
He's going to be a total mispeak.

18:48.594 --> 18:49.135
He's going to keep that in.

18:49.155 --> 18:49.495
I agree with you.

18:49.475 --> 19:06.222
but obviously for the same reasons you never, for the same reasons you don't want to be seen with a pencil or a pad of paper.

19:06.242 --> 19:08.646
The thought of carrying a camera would identify you as a tourist or somebody doing a... I wouldn't carry a camera.

19:08.666 --> 19:09.528
Of course it's a heavy, it's a dead weight.

19:09.548 --> 19:09.728
Secondly,

19:10.214 --> 19:20.250
If I have a problem, if I take a picture of something, I don't look at it.

19:25.619 --> 19:28.123
I don't look at the thing.

19:28.143 --> 19:28.964
I say I'm taking a picture of something.

19:28.984 --> 19:31.048
But if I'm not taking a picture of something, I look at it.

19:31.068 --> 19:32.850
Or the person or whatever.

19:32.870 --> 19:34.353
But it strikes to the philosophy of the kind of a book that you do, too.

19:34.373 --> 19:34.713
And it really is.

19:34.733 --> 19:35.715
Well, do you consider what you do an anachronism?

19:37.552 --> 19:45.602
The way I do it, I think, is anachronistic.

19:45.622 --> 19:49.646
Maybe not anachronistic as much as old-fashioned, I guess.

19:49.887 --> 20:01.821
Deliberately not staying in luxurious places and traveling on the ground, forcing myself actually to do it slowly, to write in long hair, because I realize I'm

20:02.611 --> 20:08.617
I'd rather travelling any other way.

20:08.997 --> 20:15.943
If I was getting on a plane, it would be a different experience.

20:15.963 --> 20:19.427
A plane, a computer, a meeting.

20:19.447 --> 20:20.087
I don't look people up.

20:20.107 --> 20:23.410
I don't look up, you know, someone says, you're going to see my friend.

20:23.591 --> 20:27.774
I'd rather bump, yeah, I would rather meet someone casually and find my own way up it than meet someone and have them take me around.

20:27.794 --> 20:28.715
I hate being shown around.

20:28.735 --> 20:29.496
I hate being in a foreign city

20:30.117 --> 20:39.936
looking someone up and they say, you've got to see this and you've got to see that.

20:40.116 --> 20:43.543
I would rather just find out, yeah.

20:43.563 --> 20:45.246
Whatever it is, just find out myself.

20:45.266 --> 20:47.991
Now when you write, and you, I like the fact that you tell us about Blaswell's books and Flaubert and

20:48.967 --> 21:01.462
You do this afterwards, obviously.

21:01.482 --> 21:09.271
You do this kind of research afterwards when you get back?

21:09.291 --> 21:10.052
Sometimes before, sometimes during.

21:10.072 --> 21:12.374
I mean, a lot of these books I was reading at the time, some I had read before.

21:12.394 --> 21:15.438
Then afterwards I read detailed books of history, let's say, or get to a place after.

21:15.458 --> 21:15.919
What is this all about?

21:15.939 --> 21:16.880
I mean, this is something I didn't understand.

21:16.900 --> 21:17.521
I would do some research on it.

21:17.541 --> 21:17.961
Sometimes afterwards.

21:18.734 --> 21:34.665
In these days of instant communication, everything is on television, satellite chips, everything is in color, CD-1.

21:34.685 --> 21:36.068
How does that alter, how does that influence what you do as a writer?

21:37.718 --> 21:54.459
It doesn't make any difference, because when you say everything, you mean everything that's news, really.

21:54.479 --> 21:56.001
Well, even we can see places there.

21:57.082 --> 22:01.348
I mean, when people read travel books in the 1920s or the 1930s or the 1960s, you really couldn't see, you know, the Mediterranean unless they traveled there.

22:01.368 --> 22:01.628
That's right.

22:01.648 --> 22:03.110
And the way you can now, I mean, is that everything is available.

22:03.130 --> 22:03.370
You can see.

22:03.390 --> 22:06.274
But when I wrote about China, I was writing about a place where all the camera crews

22:07.098 --> 22:10.882
were in Beijing.

22:10.922 --> 22:14.805
They weren't in the provinces.

22:15.606 --> 22:22.673
I saw people being really badly treated in the provinces in 1986 and 87.

22:22.693 --> 22:26.776
In 1989, when the Tiananmen squad massacre happened, that was something that had happened before.

22:26.796 --> 22:31.961
They had massacred students or killed students, and students had had demonstrations two years before, and I had seen them.

22:31.981 --> 22:33.323
But there were no camera crews there.

22:33.343 --> 22:33.763
In other words,

22:34.672 --> 22:54.853
In a sense, the world is well covered by cameras, but there are no cameras in the bars that I was in, in Croatia, in Dubrovnik, in Albania, in Greece, in Turkey, in Syria, in the little towns.

22:55.053 --> 22:55.914
There were no cameras there.

22:55.974 --> 22:57.936
The cameras never recorded those conversations or those places.

22:58.076 --> 23:00.679
There were much more obvious places, because it's expensive.

23:00.980 --> 23:09.588
to film a place or to have a camera crew.

23:09.608 --> 23:19.797
But if you just sent out a little guy like me, the spectacled middle-aged man going to some remote place in the hinterland, I mean, it doesn't cost anything.

23:19.817 --> 23:21.298
But you can't do that with a camera crew.

23:22.760 --> 23:23.180
Maybe it will happen.

23:23.200 --> 23:27.684
There's a new kind of journalism, kind of video journalism, where a guy is just trapping around with a video camera.

23:27.704 --> 23:28.325
That might change things.

23:28.345 --> 23:29.266
But it hasn't so far.

23:29.286 --> 23:29.586
In other words,

23:29.920 --> 23:42.717
You say, but there still has to be a sense of narrative to it.

23:42.737 --> 23:46.261
And that's one thing that the writer... That's what you do.

23:46.362 --> 23:46.462
Yeah.

23:46.482 --> 23:50.327
I mean, a story becomes... But also, I travel very slowly and inexpensively.

23:50.347 --> 23:51.448
And that's part of the narrative.

23:51.468 --> 23:53.531
And a camera crew tends to parachute in and then leave in a hurry.

23:53.551 --> 23:55.033
I go to places where nothing's happening.

23:55.334 --> 24:05.326
Television never goes to places where nothing's happened.

24:05.346 --> 24:07.429
Where nothing appears to be happening.

24:07.449 --> 24:10.572
Well, actually things are happening.

24:10.592 --> 24:12.114
People having a good time or a tough time, they live, they die.

24:12.134 --> 24:14.237
But you wouldn't think of this as journalistic, would you?

24:14.257 --> 24:14.778
I don't know what it is.

24:14.798 --> 24:19.283
I think what you said about it being an anachronism, I mean, is...

24:19.735 --> 24:33.433
Green's book, The Lawless Roads, is that journalism or, say, labels, the Evening War book?

24:33.453 --> 24:35.936
Is that journalism?

24:35.956 --> 24:37.378
The Peter Fleming books about China.

24:37.398 --> 24:44.427
In a way, it's somewhere between journalism and, I guess, documentary or journalism and fiction, I don't know.

24:44.812 --> 24:55.262
I don't see it as journalistic because it's not reporting on an event.

24:55.602 --> 25:03.910
It's confronting life in a lot of places and allowing people to talk.

25:03.930 --> 25:07.674
It's not museum-going, but it's treating people as though they're your counterpart in that place.

25:07.694 --> 25:08.835
And it's kind of ignoring history, too.

25:08.855 --> 25:09.696
How important is story to you?

25:09.716 --> 25:11.437
I mean, there's enough of us now as a channel.

25:11.457 --> 25:12.118
It's very important.

25:12.622 --> 25:17.852
As I do with a novel, characters are the story.

25:18.093 --> 25:19.355
People are the story.

25:19.375 --> 25:21.560
And so were the characters.

25:21.580 --> 25:21.680
Yeah.

25:21.700 --> 25:30.337
In a novel, say in Milroy or My Secret History or Ozone, any of those books, they're about people, you know, unusual people.

25:30.357 --> 25:30.698
And so I guess...

25:31.775 --> 26:00.347
it's looking sort of looking for people and um so this but they they're the story but they have stories too my favorite sort of thing is meeting someone and the person's telling me a long interesting story and then just saying i met so and so and he tells me stories like a like a conrad short story where he's saying well it was 1926 here and you see that hill

26:00.327 --> 26:04.614
Some people began marching over the hill.

26:04.634 --> 26:05.735
They looked like gypsies.

26:06.116 --> 26:07.078
They came in a wagon.

26:07.318 --> 26:11.384
They had horses and dogs, and they were playing music.

26:11.404 --> 26:13.407
They came into the village, and then an amazing thing happened.

26:13.548 --> 26:17.053
All ears thinking, yeah, then what, then what, then what?

26:17.489 --> 26:28.270
And they kind of fill up the narrative and suddenly the place is a landscape that has life in it.

26:28.290 --> 26:29.753
I mean, it's wonderful.

26:29.833 --> 26:31.937
It happens a lot in Toronto.

26:32.660 --> 26:46.637
You really do have an eye for detail, I have to say.

26:46.657 --> 26:52.465
Even to the names of sandwiches, the Freud, you have the Freud.

26:52.485 --> 26:55.749
That's funny, you know, and you didn't even remember what the Freud was, you know, and tomato and basil and all the way.

26:55.769 --> 26:56.009
I love that.

26:56.029 --> 26:58.252
Do you have a sense of who your readers are for these books?

26:58.272 --> 26:58.572
No, not really.

26:58.592 --> 26:59.173
I think they're people who...

26:59.744 --> 27:06.917
I've read other books of mine, because I make allusions to that.

27:08.439 --> 27:09.641
But I meet my readers, and they're amazing.

27:09.661 --> 27:11.384
Actually, I once saw Jerzy Krasinski's readers.

27:11.545 --> 27:24.267
They're all neurasthenic, middle-aged women with blazing eyes, rather hungry-looking.

27:24.871 --> 27:30.118
And he met them, and he kind of had blazing eyes, too.

27:30.138 --> 27:36.086
And then I was at a literary dinner.

27:36.106 --> 27:42.775
Jerzy Kosinski, Stephen King, and I. Yes, it was in Pittsburgh.

27:43.756 --> 27:46.420
And probably the last time Stephen King ever did anything.

27:46.440 --> 27:47.481
I think he said that.

27:47.501 --> 27:49.143
I think he said, I'm going home and finish my novel.

27:49.163 --> 27:50.305
I'm not going to do it.

27:52.529 --> 28:12.310
my readers were all sorts they were little old ladies they were students you know they cut across the socioeconomic spectrum they write me letters they're all sorts they're sometimes very elderly they're very young i met in new york you know you meet them when they when you do public speaking

28:12.762 --> 28:21.298
I don't have a reader, except I think my readers are intelligent, and they have read other things that I've written.

28:21.318 --> 28:29.674
Do you think that the readers of your travel books are generally the same people who read your pictures?

28:29.694 --> 28:30.877
I think there's some crossover.

28:30.897 --> 28:31.598
There are people who...

28:32.253 --> 28:50.013
who prefer or say they prefer travel and others who say they're fiction.

28:50.033 --> 28:50.614
But they tend to read both.

28:50.634 --> 28:52.056
Well, I'm the same guy, you know.

28:52.076 --> 28:57.923
And there's a lot of landscape in my novels and a lot of character in the travel book.

28:57.943 --> 28:59.184
So I think it ought to be a fairly satisfying experience.

28:59.204 --> 29:00.165
Which is the more challenging job for you?

29:00.185 --> 29:01.607
To write a novel or to write a travel book?

29:01.627 --> 29:01.787
A novel.

29:02.088 --> 29:12.983
The novel is a very difficult enterprise.

29:13.143 --> 29:14.825
Very difficult.

29:14.845 --> 29:19.431
Even though physically, something like this takes more physically out of you.

29:19.451 --> 29:20.032
Yeah, but that's nothing.

29:20.052 --> 29:22.115
That's like mountain biking up Mauna Kea.

29:22.135 --> 29:23.697
I'm looking at a comparison here.

29:23.717 --> 29:24.398
Yeah, well, you do it.

29:24.418 --> 29:24.959
You just plan it.

29:24.979 --> 29:25.620
You know you can do it.

29:25.640 --> 29:28.944
If you're in good health, you're optimistic, your bills are paid, everyone's happy, get on your bike and go.

29:28.964 --> 29:29.805
And you've got time.

29:29.825 --> 29:29.966
Right.

29:29.986 --> 29:31.808
But you go into a room and you say, I'm going to...

29:32.480 --> 29:35.226
I'm going to write something.

29:35.246 --> 29:40.236
I've been writing pieces for The New Yorker.

29:40.497 --> 29:44.064
You know, I don't know whether you saw them, but there were two this summer.

29:44.084 --> 29:46.148
Go ahead and write.

29:46.168 --> 29:46.489
This is fiction.

29:46.569 --> 29:48.032
Very difficult to do.

29:48.052 --> 29:48.673
It takes time.

29:48.693 --> 29:50.417
You spend days when nothing happens.

29:50.437 --> 29:51.620
I mean, everyone knows that.

29:51.640 --> 29:53.323
You've talked to lots of people who've told you that.

29:54.434 --> 30:03.723
That never happens in travel.

30:03.743 --> 30:08.367
Travel, nothing's happening.

30:08.387 --> 30:08.587
You leave.

30:08.788 --> 30:09.969
Go to another place.

30:10.029 --> 30:11.570
Talk to somebody else.

30:11.690 --> 30:13.072
Make it happen.

30:13.092 --> 30:16.655
No one has any justification for having a bad day, or a bad two days traveling.

30:16.675 --> 30:18.717
You have a bad day and then go somewhere else.

30:18.737 --> 30:21.800
But with fiction, it goes on for a long time.

30:21.820 --> 30:22.821
Some writers, unfortunately, it goes on for years.

30:24.134 --> 30:31.784
Was this a mindful attempt to replicate the Grand Tour?

30:31.804 --> 30:34.148
Yeah, in some respects.

30:37.492 --> 30:42.699
Because the Grand Tour was kind of the getting of wisdom.

30:42.719 --> 30:46.564
It was a way of finding out about the world.

30:46.624 --> 30:49.348
And the Mediterranean was the object of the Grand Tour.

30:50.155 --> 31:05.521
People on the Grand Tour went to France, went to history, went to Germany, went to the northern Mediterranean.

31:05.862 --> 31:10.450
And I thought, well, I'll do it, but I'll do it with a Grand Tour with a good day.

31:10.470 --> 31:12.794
And the idea of a Grand Tour, or even tourists, you know, kind of a, in historical terms, it's not an early concept.

31:12.814 --> 31:13.255
It's the 18th century.

31:13.275 --> 31:13.395
But...

31:14.860 --> 31:24.072
But people have been traveling in the Mediterranean since, you know, St.

31:24.152 --> 31:26.034
Paul, for example.

31:26.054 --> 31:26.355
You know, St.

31:26.435 --> 31:28.097
Paul was the religious pilgrim.

31:28.117 --> 31:28.637
But St.

31:28.738 --> 31:29.478
Paul went everywhere.

31:29.499 --> 31:33.323
It's hard to go to a place in the Mediterranean where St.

31:33.343 --> 31:36.227
Paul didn't go, or the Crusaders didn't go.

31:37.017 --> 31:49.911
Well, the Phoenicians didn't go.

31:49.931 --> 31:55.396
But I mean, it's just successive waves.

31:55.416 --> 31:57.418
It's wonderful, really, because you're constantly bumping in.

31:57.438 --> 31:59.781
Everyone leaves behind the paraphernalia of their visit.

31:59.801 --> 32:02.744
Well, I love that one guy you run into and he directs you to a place where Odysseus visited.

32:02.764 --> 32:04.606
He was so pleased that he didn't say there was a great restaurant there.

32:04.626 --> 32:05.227
No, he said the Lestragonians.

32:05.247 --> 32:05.607
The Lestragonians.

32:06.059 --> 32:08.463
It's amazing.

32:09.686 --> 32:11.910
It was in Corsica.

32:12.090 --> 32:15.296
Yeah, it is nice.

32:17.140 --> 32:19.564
And you talk about residences from, you know.

32:19.584 --> 32:23.050
Yeah, they're not saying, you know, Fellini made a movie here.

32:23.071 --> 32:24.433
There's a famous murder here.

32:24.453 --> 32:25.976
They're actually saying, Ulysses came here.

32:25.996 --> 32:26.557
And it's a particular thing.

32:26.577 --> 32:27.419
And it's in the Odyssey.

32:27.439 --> 32:29.282
Well, there was a guy some years ago who actually tried to...

32:31.321 --> 32:36.289
following the Odyssey, I guess, by reading the Odyssey.

32:36.309 --> 32:39.615
It's not accurate geographically.

32:39.715 --> 32:44.603
Some of it is and some of it isn't.

32:44.804 --> 32:49.812
I read several books on the subject.

32:49.832 --> 32:51.034
There's several places where

32:52.803 --> 33:04.637
You know that, like, Scylla and Charybdis, the Straits of Messina, definitely.

33:05.858 --> 33:07.860
Bonapaceo and Torsica, definitely.

33:07.880 --> 33:08.281
Gervo, definitely.

33:10.023 --> 33:10.683
Ulysses went all those places.

33:10.703 --> 33:13.126
And then also Ithaca, you know, it was from Ithaca.

33:14.107 --> 33:14.608
So the Greek places.

33:14.628 --> 33:20.174
And Troy, but there's other, you know, a lot of it is, first, Homer might not have existed, so it might be just an oral... Well, some of you had to write those poems, though.

33:20.274 --> 33:21.876
In fact, if Shakespeare wasn't Shakespeare, some of you did Shakespeare.

33:21.896 --> 33:22.557
Well...

33:22.992 --> 33:32.460
It does reflect one voice, don't you think?

33:34.202 --> 33:41.348
It would be, but on the other hand, there's poetry.

33:41.368 --> 33:44.291
We know Somalia from our ID, right?

33:44.311 --> 33:48.695
But Somalia has the greatest old tradition in poetry outside of Greece.

33:48.715 --> 33:52.358
There are poems in Somalia that are recited by singers all now.

33:52.760 --> 33:57.149
chanters, poets.

33:57.169 --> 34:03.501
The poems are hundreds of years old, maybe centuries old, maybe a thousand years old.

34:03.541 --> 34:05.605
They're still reciting them.

34:05.625 --> 34:06.507
They've never been written down.

34:06.547 --> 34:09.714
They were never written down by the Italian missionaries.

34:09.734 --> 34:11.477
Yeah, but the language, well now they have them.

34:12.031 --> 34:24.448
But until, let's say, the 30s, 1930s, people were just going into villages and reciting these very, very long, elaborate poems about the deeds of great heroes.

34:24.889 --> 34:31.097
In Hawaii, people chanted the genealogies of, you know, great man who did this, who did that, who related to it.

34:31.117 --> 34:33.320
It's very similar to the Greek tradition, I think, of reciting.

34:33.340 --> 34:35.844
So I'm not saying that was the case, but it could have been the case.

34:35.864 --> 34:36.705
It easily could have been the case.

34:36.685 --> 34:40.881
People say, how would they remember it?

34:40.901 --> 34:42.869
How do the Somalis remember these enormous poems?

34:42.889 --> 34:46.543
And people start reciting and then someone takes up and they go on and on.

34:47.553 --> 35:10.198
Well, this is the sixth major travel book.

35:10.218 --> 35:12.180
You look on the shelf, I don't know how many titles you have, but I didn't get to the cover today.

35:12.200 --> 35:13.382
It's quite an impressive, but... About 30 through 33 pages.

35:13.402 --> 35:16.225
Do you finish a novel as you did last year and say, it's time to... You're feeling the call, the sirens drop, to go out and do a travel book?

35:16.245 --> 35:16.345
Um...

35:16.865 --> 35:40.006
And there's still one or two continents you haven't... Oh, there's lots of places I haven't, but... I would say, if I don't... If I haven't got a book bursting in my brain, rather than sit around and worry about, you know, because anyone can write.

35:40.026 --> 35:40.527
You can do journalism.

35:40.547 --> 35:40.887
I do interviews.

35:40.907 --> 35:41.388
I visit places.

35:41.628 --> 35:41.988
I do travel stuff.

35:43.029 --> 35:44.070
I go write pieces.

35:44.455 --> 35:52.472
asked me recently if I would do something about William Burroughs, for example.

35:52.492 --> 35:59.567
They say, we'd like to take a train, we'd like to do this, we'd like to visit this destination.

35:59.587 --> 36:03.375
And I sometimes say, but rather than do that, if I can't, if I'm going to go into that, I would imagine a long trip.

36:04.196 --> 36:04.978
I mean, I find that the

36:05.667 --> 36:18.752
that the temptation to take a long, interesting trip is better than just to do a week here or a week there.

36:19.113 --> 36:19.915
And it's very satisfying.

36:19.975 --> 36:22.680
So, I mean, the answer is, ideally, I sometimes think I have a really lucky life because

36:25.073 --> 36:30.966
There are a lot of writers who, if they're not writing a novel, are worrying about not writing a novel.

36:30.986 --> 36:33.912
If I'm not writing a novel, I think that I'll go somewhere.

36:33.932 --> 36:39.505
I may not get an idea, but I love travel, even if I weren't writing about it.

36:39.665 --> 36:40.828
A long ago, I was in Ecuador.

36:40.848 --> 36:43.273
I loved being in Ecuador, a bird watcher.

36:43.293 --> 36:43.774
I didn't write about it.

36:44.952 --> 37:02.075
I don't need to write about travel, but I need... At some point, though, is there a switch that goes on to say, you know, there's something here I could write about.

37:02.095 --> 37:06.601
And then you have to switch modes and all of a sudden become a writer as opposed to really a traveler?

37:06.621 --> 37:08.023
Well, there's a great incentive to write...

37:08.560 --> 37:13.386
a travel book, what you write about travel is to sing for your supper.

37:13.426 --> 37:15.689
This is paying your way.

37:17.812 --> 37:19.514
Travel's expensive.

37:19.534 --> 37:34.714
Also, I realize that when I'm writing a travel book, I'm accounting for that whole period of my life, a year or two years or eight months, whatever it is, the whole time that I've been traveling is a kind of, it's an autobiographical experience, too.

37:35.154 --> 37:35.855
Let's check.

37:37.678 --> 37:38.078
Yep, we're fine.

37:39.037 --> 37:52.753
So the idea of having a record of everything that you did for that period is interesting.

37:52.773 --> 37:56.618
Well, you do have two publishers, and you do kind of separate your two lives, don't you?

37:56.638 --> 37:57.198
Your two writing lives.

37:57.218 --> 38:01.343
What, the Houghton Riff one for the fiction, and Houghton for the travel?

38:01.363 --> 38:01.864
It has been.

38:01.884 --> 38:02.885
Well, Random House has done fiction.

38:03.145 --> 38:03.746
I'm sorry, Random House.

38:03.766 --> 38:05.088
You wouldn't have written Houghton.

38:05.108 --> 38:07.050
I have, but I was years with him.

38:07.070 --> 38:07.170
Yeah.

38:07.150 --> 38:32.700
But in any case, why is that such a practical situation for you?

38:32.720 --> 38:33.941
Why not do everything, you know, different editors, I gather.

38:33.961 --> 38:35.363
It's better, you know, some publishers work better with certain books.

38:35.383 --> 38:37.005
I think Cotton's excellent publisher for non-fiction, particularly for my travel.

38:37.357 --> 38:47.171
Random House is a great tradition as a publisher of fiction.

38:47.812 --> 38:53.360
A really good author there, Joe Mark.

38:53.420 --> 38:55.002
So it's just a happy arrangement.

38:55.022 --> 38:56.685
It was with Houghton Nicklin, too, but publishers change.

38:56.745 --> 39:00.430
Houghton, in particular, has changed dramatically.

39:00.450 --> 39:05.457
It's not the same, but when I first met you, what's the telegram one?

39:06.736 --> 39:19.119
Ed Miffin was a small Boston firm that was publishing on authors.

39:19.179 --> 39:24.049
I mean, they weren't publishing a single book.

39:24.710 --> 39:26.553
I figured I was there, you know.

39:26.573 --> 39:27.255
And it did.

39:27.275 --> 39:30.060
It became, well, the market determined it.

39:30.293 --> 39:41.625
It had to become bigger and they had to get more interested in blockbusters.

39:41.765 --> 39:49.354
It's not the same place.

39:49.374 --> 39:51.636
Is Joe Cannon still there?

39:51.656 --> 39:51.816
Joe who?

39:51.836 --> 39:53.578
Joe Cannon.

39:53.818 --> 39:55.200
Joe Cannon.

39:55.220 --> 39:55.500
I don't know.

39:55.520 --> 39:56.301
He was the head of it.

39:57.226 --> 40:12.849
I really don't have much contact with them.

40:12.869 --> 40:13.790
I deal with a publicist in New York.

40:13.810 --> 40:15.713
Who's that?

40:15.733 --> 40:16.715
Irene Williams and Marjorie Glaser.

40:16.735 --> 40:17.436
They're two publicists in New York.

40:17.456 --> 40:17.896
Good moment, right?

40:18.037 --> 40:19.639
No, just off the record, I sometimes wonder what happened to all of them.

40:20.733 --> 40:34.066
The publicist that came down the line.

40:34.086 --> 40:34.386
Christina Rego.

40:34.406 --> 40:34.627
She's gone.

40:34.647 --> 40:35.148
Sandy Goroff is the left.

40:35.168 --> 40:35.449
Ellen Emerson.

40:35.469 --> 40:35.890
Where are they going?

40:36.443 --> 40:47.538
I'm not going to ask you questions about the book, because Ben's obviously speaking.

40:47.558 --> 40:49.380
Did you hope to find anything that your predecessors had missed?

40:49.400 --> 40:54.927
Because there are so many drama writers that have been to me.

40:54.947 --> 40:59.053
That's the challenge.

40:59.073 --> 41:03.919
Going to a place which is almost a cliche, going to the Mediterranean.

41:05.772 --> 41:21.416
I said Albania's in the Mediterranean, Lebanon's in the Mediterranean, Libya, Algeria, Croatia.

41:21.436 --> 41:30.049
There's a lot of places in the Mediterranean that aren't the Riviera.

41:30.069 --> 41:32.252
So it's actually...

41:33.245 --> 41:38.491
The thing to do is... Right, so look at the whole thing.

41:38.511 --> 41:45.700
It's like, when I wrote about England, Britain, a lot of people thought, it's a little hard.

41:46.561 --> 41:47.582
Britain's a really nice place.

41:47.642 --> 41:54.170
When they thought about Britain, they think, Britain's really England, and England is just green lawns and people playing tennis.

41:54.270 --> 41:55.932
Well, that's not true.

41:55.952 --> 42:00.838
So a lot of people thought, my book was a little hard on them.

42:01.173 --> 42:05.887
And that I had somehow got the wrong end of this thing.

42:05.907 --> 42:06.408
Well, I wasn't.

42:06.428 --> 42:10.299
I mean, it's a lot of different things.

42:10.319 --> 42:11.122
I mean, it's amazingly complex.

42:11.142 --> 42:12.947
There's rich, there's poor, there's prosperous, not prosperous.

42:13.228 --> 42:16.397
You know, old people, retired.

42:16.799 --> 42:30.565
this pollution.

42:30.585 --> 42:33.290
Everything in Britain is on its coast.

42:33.310 --> 42:34.252
And the Mediterranean is insane.

42:34.272 --> 42:36.256
Some people think the Mediterranean is just the sun-drenched part of Italy.

42:36.276 --> 42:37.979
So I took a step back and I thought, this whole thing is the Mediterranean.

42:37.999 --> 42:38.841
I'm going to try to do the whole thing.

42:39.867 --> 42:45.620
It's a challenge, but it's more in how much time you have and whether you have the stomach for it.

42:46.161 --> 42:52.375
So I think the race goes to the people who really lasted.

42:52.692 --> 43:09.927
Do you get a little pressier as you get older doing this, or do you still have the same enthusiasm as breakfast?

43:09.947 --> 43:11.190
I have a lot of what I intend to irony people take as Frankie.

43:11.423 --> 43:26.068
I mean, I find, like the Evelyn Moore book, I find that kind of... He talks about a wine smelling like evening... He says it smells like evening newspaper.

43:26.088 --> 43:30.996
It has a taste like evening newspapers.

43:31.016 --> 43:31.737
I don't know.

43:31.757 --> 43:34.562
The quotations that I use from labels...

43:35.875 --> 44:00.617
people say oh he's just an old curmudgeon actually it's very funny it's a very funny book and i find that funny english people find it funny if i mean they did but some people are very very threatened by by that i don't exaggerate i don't think and i don't lie i i i was in chicago yesterday and i had a brief

44:01.357 --> 44:03.099
session at the Art Institute.

44:03.380 --> 44:05.062
Do you know a painter called Ivan Albright?

44:06.063 --> 44:13.293
Ivan Albright, Ivan Lee Lorraine Albright, was famous for being able to paint rotting flesh.

44:13.313 --> 44:16.838
His portraits are of, they look grotesque.

44:18.420 --> 44:20.563
The titles are... Of America?

44:20.723 --> 44:21.684
Chicago, yeah.

44:22.025 --> 44:29.655
Although he went to Woodstock, Vermont in the 1960s and I think spent a lot of time there.

44:29.755 --> 44:31.077
But he's Chicago's great

44:31.327 --> 44:32.730
punk painter.

44:32.750 --> 44:34.334
And he really is great.

44:34.354 --> 44:41.890
But I was, I read, anyway, you look at the paintings, the paintings are amazingly frightening.

44:41.910 --> 44:44.856
And they're all, they're portraits or this picture of a door.

44:44.917 --> 44:46.721
The door took him 10 years to do.

44:47.402 --> 44:49.707
Anyway, he said, I've often been accused of

44:50.075 --> 45:03.011
of being ghoulish or doing, you know, horrible pictures.

45:03.031 --> 45:09.298
He said, but I think that of myself as a painter, perceives life clearly and honestly.

45:09.539 --> 45:14.264
He's, you know, he's kind of like the portrait of Dorian Gray, you know, horror.

45:14.284 --> 45:15.706
I think he did the pictures for Dorian Gray.

45:16.287 --> 45:17.348
What would move a man to do a lot of flesh?

45:18.610 --> 45:44.230
will not be terrible they're not they're corpse-like people but he said i've seen that clearly and honestly yes black please are you mindful of the time no we'll move pretty soon okay

45:45.577 --> 45:58.400
Yeah, what we'll do is have a coffee and then I'll hit these two bookstores.

45:58.580 --> 45:58.680
Okay.

45:58.700 --> 46:01.686
I've been inscribing this from the right of waiting for your phone.

46:01.706 --> 46:02.227
I've got a pen.

46:02.247 --> 46:02.607
I've got one.

46:02.627 --> 46:03.048
I've got to have one.

46:03.068 --> 46:03.509
I'll give you my card.

46:03.529 --> 46:03.970
But where is my phone?

46:03.990 --> 46:04.210
Here it is.

46:04.848 --> 46:06.730
Yeah, thanks.

46:07.171 --> 46:09.453
Yeah, I'm still on the cable.

46:09.573 --> 46:10.574
I saw you down there.

46:10.654 --> 46:11.916
Do you still go down there?

46:12.096 --> 46:13.457
I always have a house down there.

46:13.478 --> 46:15.059
Do you have kids?

46:15.079 --> 46:15.179
I do.

46:15.199 --> 46:17.122
I know you do.

46:17.142 --> 46:23.128
I remember Christina Rego because one time she was supposed to arrange a meeting and it didn't happen.

46:23.148 --> 46:23.949
Between you and I?

46:25.331 --> 46:25.431
Yeah.

46:25.451 --> 46:26.212
She said he can't.

46:27.453 --> 46:29.235
It was a real screw up.

46:29.675 --> 46:33.199
We were supposed to meet and she said I couldn't do it.

46:33.480 --> 46:34.821
But in fact, I couldn't do it.

46:35.020 --> 46:37.425
Can I give you the... Yes.

46:42.715 --> 46:45.040
So, yeah, it was a long time ago.

46:45.060 --> 46:46.062
What's next, do you think?

46:47.746 --> 46:52.575
I'm writing a script, a Merchant Ivory script, for a movie, adapting a book.

46:53.818 --> 46:55.982
And next book, I've been working on...

46:56.114 --> 46:59.821
I don't know whether you saw them in the New Yorker this summer or two.

46:59.981 --> 47:01.404
I've published several in Granta.

47:02.566 --> 47:06.052
It's from a fictionalized autobiography.

47:06.072 --> 47:11.001
It's an autobiography, my life story, but it's completely...

47:11.318 --> 47:14.843
Paul's.

47:15.043 --> 47:17.487
That's right.

47:19.069 --> 47:20.010
Yeah.

47:20.711 --> 47:23.435
So who do you publish that one with?

47:24.056 --> 47:26.359
That will be... Is it kind of crisis?

47:26.379 --> 47:30.244
You know, I haven't actually... It's kind of crisis generously, isn't it?

47:30.264 --> 47:30.685
In a way.

47:30.885 --> 47:31.506
Yeah.

47:31.526 --> 47:33.549
But to tell you the truth, I haven't thought about publication.

47:33.649 --> 47:35.011
I've just been thinking about writing it.

47:35.031 --> 47:35.652
You haven't really started it.

47:35.672 --> 47:35.812
No, no.

47:35.832 --> 47:36.313
I've done a lot of it.

47:36.333 --> 47:37.294
But I've published a couple.

47:37.314 --> 47:37.775
That's what I say.

47:37.815 --> 47:38.095
Okay.

47:38.476 --> 47:39.958
And what would be a future travel project for you?

47:40.580 --> 47:42.488
Well, there's a lot of places that I haven't been.

47:45.642 --> 47:50.303
Of course, there's all those places I missed in the Mediterranean.

47:50.654 --> 47:51.916
I've never been to Brazil.

47:51.956 --> 47:55.583
I've never... I've never been to really obvious places, Scandinavia.

47:55.603 --> 47:58.007
I haven't seen a lot of the States, you know.

47:58.027 --> 48:00.892
I've never been to the Philippines.

48:00.912 --> 48:03.156
Well, a States piece in the book would be interesting, wouldn't it?

48:03.176 --> 48:03.357
Could be.

48:03.377 --> 48:06.542
Because, I mean, you have a particular idea of your life as kind of an expatriate.

48:07.464 --> 48:11.952
It's finding out, it's working out how to write it.

48:11.972 --> 48:12.493
I mean, I don't know.

48:12.828 --> 48:15.130
I don't know how I feel about that.

48:15.691 --> 48:16.932
Yeah, you need an itinerary.

48:16.952 --> 48:18.974
You need a reason.

48:19.094 --> 48:20.275
You need a coastline.

48:20.295 --> 48:21.376
You need a river.

48:21.396 --> 48:25.580
And every one of your books, travel books, does have that premise.

48:25.680 --> 48:28.603
Yes, there's a premise.

48:28.884 --> 48:32.047
And all books about the states that are good have a premise.

48:32.107 --> 48:33.208
They have blue highways.

48:33.228 --> 48:34.849
They have travels with Charlie.

48:34.869 --> 48:36.811
They have down the Mississippi River.

48:36.891 --> 48:39.534
They have Route 66.

48:39.554 --> 48:40.975
You know, whatever it is.

48:40.995 --> 48:42.717
You need, otherwise,

48:43.372 --> 48:46.557
What's it about, you know?

48:46.577 --> 48:48.881
Or what's the structure?

48:48.901 --> 48:53.067
It's very arbitrary anyways, but you need something a little more rigorous than that.

48:53.087 --> 49:03.844
So if you think of one, like, oh, the town's called Springfield, or a certain highway.

49:03.864 --> 49:09.413
I mean, ideally, it's a road that takes you from Bangor, Maine, to Los Angeles.

49:09.764 --> 49:12.227
But then you miss out a lot, too.

49:12.407 --> 49:15.451
Major League Baseball Park.

49:15.471 --> 49:16.953
But you know what I mean?

49:16.973 --> 49:19.456
There has to be something.

49:19.476 --> 49:20.597
And it's got to be on the ground.

49:20.617 --> 49:21.278
You can't fly.

49:22.880 --> 49:23.241
Thanks.

49:23.261 --> 49:27.386
You can't fly from place to place.

49:27.406 --> 49:29.228
I think we've got plenty of stuff.

49:33.113 --> 49:33.173
OK.
