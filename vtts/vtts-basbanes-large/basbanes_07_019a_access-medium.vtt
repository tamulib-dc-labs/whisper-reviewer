WEBVTT

00:02.849 --> 00:12.320
The best records that I know of, we have of how we got to where we are, is by writing.

00:12.640 --> 00:14.723
Not necessarily in books, but writing.

00:15.924 --> 00:32.063
And the history of all that has been accomplished, really, is what we have learned by deciphering or reading or studying skeletons, etc., but

00:32.448 --> 00:36.194
Certainly, the written record has been exceptionally important.

00:40.480 --> 00:46.789
I'm interested in the phenomenon of saving writings.

00:47.771 --> 00:53.038
Obviously, I don't have many important writings from the age of a cuneiform.

00:53.519 --> 01:00.970
I just have one tablet, so when my students come, I should show them a clay tablet that was written 3,500 years ago.

01:02.182 --> 01:18.925
I have one piece of Egyptian ... It's an interesting piece of one of their scrolls of papyrus.

01:18.945 --> 01:21.248
It's also very old.

01:21.268 --> 01:30.501
I never thought anybody could read it, including several Egyptian students that I've had.

01:31.122 --> 01:32.844
So that's a little before our time.

01:33.705 --> 01:37.409
And a few manuscripts, one time or another.

01:38.090 --> 01:43.756
Mostly, I guess, all I've got are the books that have been important in the development of medicine.

01:45.257 --> 01:58.952
From that time to this, that I've been able to find and enjoy looking at, studying how they were made and where they've been, if possible.

02:00.164 --> 02:10.317
and learning what it was that they gave to us in the formation of the practice of medicine, if you like.

02:10.337 --> 02:13.942
The science, the art, the problems.

02:14.002 --> 02:20.750
Did you start collecting prior to becoming a physician?

02:21.331 --> 02:21.611
No.

02:23.694 --> 02:26.037
Prior to becoming a physician,

02:26.303 --> 02:31.449
I was a medical student, and once I was a physician, I was doing research.

02:32.370 --> 02:48.568
And there, of course, was involved with reading records of other investigators who had worked in the same field, which is, in part, learning the history of my special function of the intestinal tract.

02:48.588 --> 02:55.956
So that, you know, you start looking at that, and then you develop into looking at other things as well.

02:56.189 --> 03:01.976
I wonder what brought you to the collecting of the book.

03:02.777 --> 03:05.160
Well, that had nothing to do with any reality.

03:06.241 --> 03:26.044
A local book dealer gave a talk to our library association, and he had for sale a copy of The Sages, which was the first modern anatomy book.

03:27.661 --> 03:29.924
That was published in 1542.

03:31.527 --> 03:35.633
But prior to that time, anatomy was really gross.

03:35.833 --> 03:38.838
It was impossible to be useful.

03:40.360 --> 03:57.465
It so happened that he had an artist who obviously studied his dissections with him, and who was able to draw the anatomy of the human being.

03:57.614 --> 03:59.476
that is as good as any modern.

03:59.496 --> 03:59.896
Really?

04:00.116 --> 04:04.680
Well, not in polar details, but yes.

04:05.901 --> 04:13.168
He had woodblocks prepared, and published this.

04:13.188 --> 04:22.997
Now, there were several contemporary anatomists, one of whom, you might just jot that this down as a site.

04:23.597 --> 04:26.440
Eustachius was a

04:27.432 --> 04:36.503
Italian physician who actually had prepared wood blocks.

04:36.523 --> 04:37.284
Not wood blocks.

04:37.304 --> 04:41.049
I think it was engraving steel or copper.

04:42.250 --> 04:46.355
And he had done dissections, and he had learned a good bit of anatomy.

04:47.937 --> 04:55.887
And he had been to see the pope who was sick, and on his way back home he died, whatever it was the pope had, and nobody ever saw.

04:56.440 --> 05:06.469
The illustrations that he made, except a few of the kidney, but the gross anatomy was published in 1714, I think it was.

05:07.249 --> 05:20.681
So Eustachius, though he was a good anatomist, and really had done a hell of a good job, he was unfortunately not working on it.

05:20.701 --> 05:25.705
There was one other, I think it was a Frenchman.

05:26.714 --> 05:40.249
But he also would have published before Mercedes, except he was working with another doctor and had an argument.

05:41.170 --> 05:43.973
The other doctor sued him, and the court would not let him publish.

05:44.833 --> 05:53.683
So the book that should have come out in 1539 didn't come out till 1546 after Mercedes.

05:53.849 --> 05:59.496
So, you know, that's one of those very funny stories.

05:59.997 --> 06:01.218
It should be.

06:01.238 --> 06:03.401
Is there a bibliography in your specialty?

06:03.421 --> 06:05.724
You pretty much have had to develop your own.

06:05.744 --> 06:06.805
Oh, God, yes.

06:06.825 --> 06:08.027
Oh, I mean, in internal medicine.

06:08.047 --> 06:11.772
This is your... Oh, it's bibliography.

06:11.792 --> 06:14.615
In every field of medicine.

06:14.775 --> 06:15.296
Yeah.

06:15.416 --> 06:18.220
But, I mean, even in the old books, under the classic books, yeah.

06:18.260 --> 06:20.903
Here, for instance, is a...

06:22.148 --> 06:23.850
A book that lists.

06:24.551 --> 06:30.357
And may I?

06:30.457 --> 06:36.824
You'd have to know what you're looking for, but, you know, there are many lists.

06:36.864 --> 06:41.309
Tell me a little bit about how long have you been practicing medicine, Doctor?

06:41.329 --> 06:50.839
I graduated from medical school in 1937, Philadelphia, interned in Los Angeles County General Hospital for two years.

06:51.697 --> 07:00.208
Went back to Penn and Jefferson, did research, did graduate work, and was teaching.

07:01.510 --> 07:09.961
All mixed up until 1942, and some kind of thing broke out in Europe.

07:10.081 --> 07:15.107
I felt that I had to do something with it.

07:16.249 --> 07:17.831
And we had our oldest son.

07:19.073 --> 07:20.134
Everything was fine.

07:21.532 --> 07:29.402
So I told my wife, and I said, look, we've got to do whatever we can.

07:29.422 --> 07:31.986
So I got in the Army.

07:34.168 --> 07:36.732
And are you a Californian?

07:36.792 --> 07:43.280
Well, I was a Philadelphian until 1960, and then became a Californian and moved here.

07:43.501 --> 07:47.806
Oh, so you've been here 30 years.

07:47.866 --> 07:50.249
Well, you were collecting books then before you came here?

07:50.309 --> 07:50.830
Not really.

07:52.312 --> 07:57.798
Well, I was collecting titles and information, but not actual books.

07:58.579 --> 08:01.042
And my first book was this, Vesalius.

08:01.122 --> 08:07.209
The Vesalius, you got out here in California.

08:07.289 --> 08:08.731
Yeah.

08:09.812 --> 08:15.659
I was just wondering at what point you decided to become a collector.

08:15.679 --> 08:17.141
It's hard to say.

08:17.181 --> 08:20.665
I went to see the Vesalius.

08:22.045 --> 08:24.768
And I felt a great kinship.

08:26.650 --> 08:31.355
And next thing you know, I bought the goddamn thing.

08:31.375 --> 08:33.998
And from then on, I guess I was a collector.

08:34.638 --> 08:38.462
This is at a local bookstore, Dawson's, if and so on.

08:38.482 --> 08:43.768
Well, we'd like that, except we'd deal with it.

08:44.088 --> 08:50.034
And you look like you have some extraordinary, are all the books illustrative books, basically?

08:50.054 --> 08:50.635
No, no.

08:52.268 --> 08:57.613
And so your focus has been to try to document the history of your profession, I guess, in a phrase.

08:58.854 --> 08:59.475
That's right.

08:59.495 --> 09:03.659
And how thoroughly would you say you've been able to do it?

09:04.000 --> 09:08.364
I think reasonably well.

09:10.606 --> 09:15.811
Do you feel that, you know, there's this illness they call biblio-mania?

09:16.031 --> 09:17.793
I approach it at times.

09:20.075 --> 09:21.837
I think you'll have difficulty in

09:22.323 --> 09:27.709
separating me from the bibliomaniacs.

09:27.729 --> 09:34.997
But... Being a professional diagnostician, could you tell me a little bit about what are the symptoms of this disease?

09:37.180 --> 09:50.575
Well, I guess an overwhelming desire to hold books, look at old books, and... And... Presumably, you could...

09:50.993 --> 10:01.608
These are very valuable items, and I presume you could get a later edition, which would be... What is it to have the first edition?

10:01.628 --> 10:07.656
Well, to have the first is to get a look at how this started.

10:07.676 --> 10:18.992
And if you're looking at the history and development of any particular art, economic policy, information of any kind,

10:20.221 --> 10:32.592
I think it's always important to have an idea how it started and how it developed, so that part of it is a desire to see how it began.

10:34.854 --> 10:36.636
What do you hope to do with the library?

10:37.737 --> 10:42.261
That's something we haven't really completely decided.

10:45.023 --> 10:46.925
I don't know for sure.

10:46.945 --> 10:47.845
You're enjoying it.

10:47.886 --> 10:49.587
That's the important part.

10:50.377 --> 11:03.594
Alan indicated that you've been involved in local book collecting groups and stuff like that, and you might be able to give us some sense of book collecting in Los Angeles.

11:05.296 --> 11:12.205
Every big city that I know of has a group of people with the syllabus.

11:12.225 --> 11:20.215
They look all over the city, and all classes and all styles.

11:21.275 --> 11:28.124
Unfortunately, the field that I chose and was interested in happens to be one that was started long ago.

11:31.089 --> 11:36.276
The first of the books, you know, what am I going to say?

11:38.058 --> 11:42.404
Egyptian papyri, which I don't happen to have one, I've described.

11:44.387 --> 11:51.096
I guess this is surgery for stone, bladder stone, 3,500 years ago.

11:51.937 --> 11:55.121
Yeah, it's amazing.

11:55.141 --> 11:57.564
Did they perform surgery for the virus?

12:00.667 --> 12:13.122
Well, if you had a diagnosis and you didn't have any good x-rays, but if the patient passed red urine and had severe pain at a certain time, you would guess that that was it.

12:14.623 --> 12:16.105
And if you got him drunk enough,

12:16.473 --> 12:22.162
had some people hold them down and get the bladder open and get it out.

12:23.484 --> 12:25.907
And some of them got recovered.

12:27.790 --> 12:29.993
So you took your chances, I guess.

12:30.214 --> 12:31.576
Well, yeah.

12:33.238 --> 12:37.004
You didn't operate on the king until you'd done a lot.

12:38.106 --> 12:45.737
But, you know, that's... There are quite a few

12:46.173 --> 12:49.297
Philadelphia is quite a book collecting area.

12:50.359 --> 12:50.739
Oh, yes.

12:50.839 --> 12:52.481
I've spent a lot of time down there.

12:52.501 --> 12:55.365
Well, you know the College of Physicians, of course.

12:55.645 --> 12:55.946
Of course, yes.

12:56.066 --> 13:01.393
And my professor would be, he broke land.

13:02.775 --> 13:12.788
He had a great collection that we students would be invited to his own exams, you know what?

13:17.425 --> 13:25.073
And, of course, the College of Physicians is all great.

13:25.894 --> 13:28.036
Are you interested mostly in medicine?

13:28.717 --> 13:34.223
No, I'm interested in books, and not just books, but manuscripts, anything.

13:34.823 --> 13:38.187
I'm really interested in collecting, and the passion.

13:38.227 --> 13:40.329
So you're collecting collectors and stuff?

13:40.349 --> 13:41.650
Yeah, that's it.

13:41.670 --> 13:47.196
You've got it, and it makes some sense out of the whole thing, and tells some interesting stories.

13:48.020 --> 13:54.487
In your field, have you pretty much stayed close to that focus, or have you strayed?

13:54.847 --> 13:56.229
Medicine, yes.

13:56.790 --> 14:00.714
Gastroenterology, no.

14:00.734 --> 14:03.637
I mean, strayed through the field of medicine.

14:04.658 --> 14:10.264
Have you acquired pretty much out here, or have you traveled to hunt for the things?

14:10.284 --> 14:17.352
Well, I have hunted for things, but I will say that once I got started,

14:18.142 --> 14:25.249
sellers hunted for me, and it was very quick, very short time for me.

14:25.450 --> 14:45.010
Harry Levinson was the one who sold me to Vesalius, and within a couple of months, one of Jake Zaper, who was the other bookseller, called me up, and he has a wonderful book.

14:45.513 --> 14:49.478
So, you know, Jake is quite an institution out here.

14:49.498 --> 14:50.018
Yes.

14:50.038 --> 14:53.282
So he was second in line.

14:53.603 --> 14:56.166
But then after that, they were all there.

14:56.186 --> 15:05.356
And I gather, because it's such a specialized field, there aren't that many people who are collecting, or would you say that there are quite a few?

15:05.376 --> 15:07.980
There are quite a few, I think.

15:08.821 --> 15:15.148
You know, before I was collecting, I had, well, the first edition of

15:15.685 --> 15:18.468
in my medical textbook.

15:19.509 --> 15:22.152
Why, I don't know.

15:22.172 --> 15:24.455
I never looked at it.

15:24.475 --> 15:33.645
But I'd seen it in a second-hand store in Philadelphia, and it was $4.50 or something, so I bought it.

15:35.888 --> 15:40.112
You know, and I think there are many, many documents in the government.

15:40.152 --> 15:45.118
Do you enjoy the collection as much today as you did when you started it in 1960?

15:45.402 --> 15:47.224
It's not the kind of thing you get bored of.

15:47.285 --> 15:50.549
It's not the acquisition that gives you the satisfaction.

15:50.569 --> 15:57.899
No, I enjoy looking through it, see what I have on this or that.

15:57.919 --> 16:00.042
Do you learn anything from his old books?

16:00.062 --> 16:02.044
Anything?

16:02.064 --> 16:02.825
I don't think so.

16:03.086 --> 16:15.122
Learn how things develop, and also see how time changes things, and how much of what we do now is very similar to what they did then.

16:15.693 --> 16:27.511
realized that there was a dean at UCLA named Sherman Mellinkoff.

16:27.531 --> 16:36.225
He is really, he started as a gastroenterologist, but he, next thing you know, became dean of medicine medical school.

16:38.709 --> 16:44.097
Very thoughtful, very bright, very capable guy, and he

16:46.203 --> 17:16.075
about a year ago published a paper in general, in the General Environmental Association, which I have to find because I've lost my copy of it, in which he pointed out that of the thousands of herbs and preparations that we know about, and the many hundreds that we have studied and used

17:16.460 --> 17:19.303
Those in orange.

17:20.744 --> 17:23.386
There's six left.

17:25.248 --> 17:26.629
Yeah, just six.

17:28.491 --> 17:30.453
The aspirin comes from the willow tree.

17:31.414 --> 17:34.637
The flying one comes from some goddamn tree in South America.

17:37.740 --> 17:40.922
Digitalis comes from the foxglove.

17:44.005 --> 17:45.647
That's about a four or not.

17:45.667 --> 17:45.927
That's right.

17:46.497 --> 18:07.411
All the rest are chemicals that have been possibly present after some of these, but changed completely.

18:07.431 --> 18:11.678
There was just a piece in the New York Times about some

18:12.316 --> 18:22.129
There's a ewe, a tree that they harvest up in the Pacific Northwest, which apparently they're finding successful in the treatment of something.

18:22.149 --> 18:22.890
Did you see that?

18:22.910 --> 18:23.530
Some cancer, yeah.

18:23.550 --> 18:24.572
Yeah.

18:24.592 --> 18:26.534
And there was never any use for the tree.

18:26.594 --> 18:29.378
Now all of a sudden— Oh, they used it for something, I can tell you.

18:32.041 --> 18:34.404
All of these things were used for something.

18:38.189 --> 18:40.332
Every grandmother had a collection.

18:41.662 --> 18:45.706
Do you have an old grandmother?

18:45.726 --> 18:47.268
Margaret chamomile tea.

18:47.288 --> 18:47.768
Yes.

18:48.829 --> 18:50.811
And the yucca plants you had?

18:50.911 --> 18:51.372
Yes.

18:52.733 --> 18:56.297
Well, they all had a collection of dried things and what have you.

18:56.317 --> 19:03.624
They used, when you had something, they rubbed it on your chest or gave it to you a drink or what have you.

19:03.644 --> 19:07.648
Some of them made you feel good, especially if they put it in wine.

19:07.668 --> 19:10.791
And, uh, this is, uh,

19:11.581 --> 19:14.745
It's been every single culture.

19:15.105 --> 19:15.806
That's another thing.

19:15.846 --> 19:16.767
It's a general thing.

19:16.787 --> 19:18.790
Let me show you some things.

19:18.810 --> 19:22.094
Yeah, I'd love to sit down.

19:22.114 --> 19:23.956
Let me show you that.

19:23.976 --> 19:25.598
Oh, good, good, good.

19:25.618 --> 19:33.248
This has nothing to do with medicine.

19:33.408 --> 19:35.911
This is the Egyptian... Oh, that's the firing animal.

19:35.931 --> 19:36.111
Go there.

19:36.131 --> 19:38.554
Now, there's the procession.

19:38.574 --> 19:39.816
They're pulling this wagon.

19:40.454 --> 19:46.080
See the mommies and they're pulling through the street and he was a priest as part of the procession.

19:46.480 --> 19:47.441
Is that part of the same?

19:47.581 --> 19:48.062
Yeah.

19:49.443 --> 19:52.506
And this was about 3,200 years ago.

19:52.566 --> 19:58.573
You know, it's something, isn't it?

20:00.274 --> 20:00.695
Crazy.

20:00.715 --> 20:02.877
It's preserved pretty decently, isn't it?

20:05.339 --> 20:07.862
And you said, well, I dug it out of the ground, you know, really.

20:08.264 --> 20:10.987
He said you had a chileiform tablet, I guess.

20:11.087 --> 20:12.969
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:16.353 --> 20:17.054
Oh, yeah, yeah.

20:17.134 --> 20:23.361
For instance, this is one that I bought a few years ago.

20:23.381 --> 20:26.845
Oh, that's from China.

20:27.106 --> 20:29.168
Yeah, that's one.

20:29.188 --> 20:30.309
Well, you know them well.

20:30.390 --> 20:33.193
These are not good news.

20:33.213 --> 20:33.553
You see?

20:34.815 --> 20:35.976
Well, if you look at it,

20:37.255 --> 20:40.038
Does it look like maybe you're using legs?

20:41.319 --> 20:42.420
It's a form of mandrake.

20:43.621 --> 20:45.903
But it's sold as a drug.

20:45.923 --> 20:47.605
Well, it's the best drug there is.

20:47.645 --> 20:49.567
It kills any of you.

20:49.587 --> 20:50.948
Look at that.

20:50.968 --> 20:52.309
Yeah, look at that thing.

20:54.111 --> 20:56.653
Well, they have all kinds of stores.

20:56.733 --> 20:57.814
It's still very popular in China.

20:59.336 --> 20:59.896
Oh, God, yeah.

20:59.916 --> 21:01.778
Oh, it's in LA, too.

21:03.420 --> 21:06.403
No, it's not true.

21:06.423 --> 21:06.823
There's a...

21:09.419 --> 21:12.283
This is a little frozen box.

21:13.484 --> 21:17.149
And this is a geometron tablet.

21:17.169 --> 21:27.302
And so happens I have a nephew, who is now a professor of such stuff at Harvard.

21:27.882 --> 21:30.426
And among other things, he reads these.

21:30.446 --> 21:30.706
Oh!

21:31.607 --> 21:33.409
Did he give you, would he be able to play for it?

21:33.569 --> 21:33.790
Yeah.

21:34.090 --> 21:34.411
Oh, he did.

21:34.431 --> 21:37.975
It's a list of animals that some storekeeper probably sold one day.

21:38.950 --> 21:41.193
Seven chickens, one cow, two goats.

21:41.213 --> 21:42.035
They kept all their records.

21:42.055 --> 21:43.116
This is pre-paper.

21:43.417 --> 21:43.817
Right.

21:43.837 --> 21:44.919
But they didn't write on paper.

21:44.979 --> 21:45.840
They didn't have paper.

21:46.541 --> 21:47.403
Yeah, it's wonderful.

21:47.423 --> 21:48.604
This is how old, do you figure?

21:49.225 --> 21:53.191
Better than 3,000 years old.

21:53.431 --> 21:56.836
Did they bake those, or did they... Oh, yeah, this is baked.

21:56.857 --> 22:00.141
This was inscribed with a stylus, and then baked.

22:01.463 --> 22:03.607
And then it... 3,000.

22:03.627 --> 22:04.748
Is that from sewer?

22:05.289 --> 22:05.970
Is it the same?

22:06.828 --> 22:16.161
And as I say, there are people now who do this stuff.

22:16.182 --> 22:28.780
And in Indonesia, this is a great play that resembles somebody's story.

22:28.800 --> 22:32.745
If you ever got to Indonesia, you'd see this play acting again and again.

22:33.807 --> 22:35.890
Oh, look at that.

22:37.017 --> 22:38.559
This is palm leaf.

22:39.840 --> 22:40.001
Palm?

22:41.523 --> 22:43.785
Some kind of palm leaf.

22:43.845 --> 22:45.587
How old is it?

22:45.608 --> 22:47.510
A couple of hundred years.

22:48.331 --> 22:48.771
About that.

22:49.793 --> 22:54.238
Here's another one.

22:54.278 --> 22:56.541
So that's the surface that they use in Indonesia?

22:56.561 --> 22:58.283
Palm leaf, yeah.

22:59.275 --> 23:00.777
Look at the delicacy.

23:01.238 --> 23:03.681
You know, it's an Australian book, huh?

23:04.021 --> 23:05.603
It is, isn't it?

23:05.623 --> 23:07.445
Yeah, I mean, you're talking about Australian books.

23:07.466 --> 23:08.046
That's right.

23:09.228 --> 23:09.668
That's why.

23:10.189 --> 23:14.274
Now, is this something you acquired here, or during your travels?

23:17.719 --> 23:24.367
I think it was Malaysia, but it could have been.

23:24.387 --> 23:27.211
And here, you're Jewish, I think.

23:27.231 --> 23:27.631
We're Greek.

23:27.992 --> 23:28.152
Greek.

23:28.486 --> 23:47.393
Well, if you were Jewish, and you were sick, they would take a piece of parchment right here, some directions to make you better, and you'd put an enambulate, like this, around here.

23:47.453 --> 23:48.635
How old is something like that?

23:51.279 --> 23:52.300
That was private.

23:52.398 --> 23:58.886
I think this is being done now.

23:59.606 --> 23:59.807
Really?

24:00.407 --> 24:00.628
Yeah.

24:01.969 --> 24:08.116
Incidentally, I have one book in Greek and I can't find the damn thing.

24:10.739 --> 24:12.541
I have completely forgotten my Greek.

24:13.803 --> 24:15.545
I took Latin in high school.

24:18.789 --> 24:20.431
Greek in high school.

24:20.511 --> 24:20.751
Yeah.

24:22.537 --> 24:25.240
In Philadelphia, they did those things.

24:25.380 --> 24:27.342
It was wonderful.

24:28.083 --> 24:29.505
So, what is it?

24:29.745 --> 24:32.408
Oh, that's Johnson's Dictionary.

24:32.968 --> 24:33.229
Oh.

24:33.249 --> 24:34.330
It's a second edition.

24:34.510 --> 24:35.311
Oh, that's nice.

24:35.331 --> 24:40.276
We're walking down the street in Boston.

24:40.296 --> 24:43.720
And my son said he saw this old book.

24:43.740 --> 24:46.283
So he went back and looked at it.

24:47.090 --> 24:54.998
Now, this is the second edition, same year as the first edition of the first great picture, really, of a product of one man.

24:55.378 --> 24:55.498
Yeah.

24:56.139 --> 24:58.601
And this week we used this for a— Did he really?

24:59.282 --> 25:00.343
Yeah.

25:00.363 --> 25:00.563
Oh, yeah.

25:00.583 --> 25:02.585
Your son, was he a collector as well?

25:02.605 --> 25:02.705
No.

25:02.765 --> 25:05.187
Did he know you were interested in this thing?

25:05.207 --> 25:06.529
Oh, yeah, yeah.

25:06.629 --> 25:07.830
And he pointed it out to you.

25:07.850 --> 25:08.571
Dad, there's something.

25:08.591 --> 25:08.771
Yeah.

25:08.791 --> 25:09.552
Something I'd like.

25:09.572 --> 25:11.113
How old was he?

25:11.133 --> 25:12.575
Seven—oh, don't you?

25:12.735 --> 25:13.195
Your son.

25:13.576 --> 25:14.076
Oh, yes, I am.

25:14.116 --> 25:16.118
He is now 48.

25:17.245 --> 25:20.510
So he was a teenager or so when he found that or whenever?

25:20.830 --> 25:24.455
No, he was a little older.

25:24.475 --> 25:28.401
Well, incidentally, that's geek.

25:28.421 --> 25:29.102
Oh, it is?

25:33.929 --> 25:34.209
Sure.

25:34.229 --> 25:35.531
You want to see some of those?

25:36.112 --> 25:37.294
I'd love to.

25:37.314 --> 25:41.099
Some of those?

25:42.241 --> 25:44.824
Well, this is USA you still talked about.

25:44.844 --> 25:45.345
Let me just put this out.

25:45.713 --> 25:55.104
I got a really silly trip sauce.

25:55.124 --> 26:10.641
It was owned by a English book collector to, you know, to put these fine bindings off and toss them away and put these on.

26:11.701 --> 26:22.720
This is the first book of your collection, William Sterling Maxwell.

26:23.661 --> 26:27.107
And this is the series.

26:27.127 --> 26:34.179
And he starts here with a wood block, showing originally, why don't you look through it.

26:34.199 --> 26:36.122
This is a guy who used to read.

26:37.992 --> 26:39.874
Dissection or whatever.

26:39.914 --> 26:41.156
That's not a living person.

26:41.176 --> 26:41.777
Oh, no, no.

26:41.797 --> 26:42.598
This person's dead.

26:44.440 --> 26:45.241
That's the same.

26:47.143 --> 26:49.546
It knows it's a woman, which is very unusual.

26:49.566 --> 26:52.930
Why is it unusual?

26:53.631 --> 26:55.754
Most women die at home.

26:56.495 --> 26:58.157
Men might die in the street.

26:58.217 --> 26:59.959
They get the body.

27:01.120 --> 27:07.408
This, where the skeleton is, was the place the old reader used to read on the

27:08.350 --> 27:12.575
Janitor used to do the dissecting, but he is doing the dissection.

27:13.536 --> 27:23.848
It's a public dissection because in Padua, where he was professor of anatomy, and where he went because they had public dissections.

27:24.809 --> 27:33.999
And if you were naughty and were tried and had stolen a piece of bread from somebody, you got 20 lashes.

27:34.820 --> 27:36.602
But if you hit him at the same time,

27:38.017 --> 27:41.661
Killed and dissected in public.

27:41.681 --> 27:43.964
You were executed and dissected in public.

27:43.984 --> 27:45.446
That's part of the punishment.

27:46.747 --> 27:49.390
So here is this thing he's doing in the section.

27:49.410 --> 27:52.474
Now that says, does that indicate that that's a caesarean?

27:52.494 --> 27:54.236
That's cum caesare.

27:54.256 --> 27:54.957
I wonder what that is.

27:56.138 --> 27:59.762
On the top line there, the cum caesare.

28:03.607 --> 28:04.007
That's right.

28:04.358 --> 28:07.764
That's Basel, that must be where it was.

28:07.924 --> 28:15.036
This was done in Padua, right near Venice, where he was professor.

28:15.056 --> 28:29.100
After he had finished writing a book, getting all the plates, he took these wood blocks by wheel train up to Gossel, where they had the best publishers around, and had them published.

28:29.705 --> 28:31.447
And this was done in public.

28:31.467 --> 28:34.050
Did people enjoy the spectacle?

28:35.771 --> 28:37.813
And here, these are barbers.

28:38.875 --> 28:41.417
Originally, the barber would do this dissection.

28:42.338 --> 28:43.579
They had their razors.

28:44.540 --> 28:48.545
Here they're trying to sell their razors, because they ain't good for anything, because he doesn't for nothing.

28:49.265 --> 28:51.928
Is this dissection, is he doing this to learn anything?

28:54.491 --> 28:54.851
Sure.

28:55.372 --> 28:58.615
But I'm just wondering why the public, why would he do it in public?

28:58.865 --> 29:02.010
Because that was the body he got.

29:02.470 --> 29:04.754
You were dissected in public.

29:04.774 --> 29:07.458
That's part of your punishment.

29:07.478 --> 29:10.082
So this woman must have done something dreadfully broad.

29:10.522 --> 29:13.226
Yeah.

29:13.246 --> 29:14.748
But let me show you these.

29:14.768 --> 29:15.690
Oh, this is wonderful.

29:16.912 --> 29:18.214
This was 1543, huh?

29:19.035 --> 29:21.058
This is your first book.

29:21.318 --> 29:24.843
This is quite a beginning to a question.

29:24.863 --> 29:27.007
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:27.027 --> 29:28.028
Incidentally, there's some letters.

29:28.126 --> 29:31.451
Do you read the Latin?

29:31.471 --> 29:41.546
A little better than my Greek.

29:41.566 --> 29:53.824
How did I stand up today for accuracy?

29:54.846 --> 29:55.186
Look at it.

29:55.206 --> 29:56.428
This looks like I'm lying.

29:56.948 --> 29:57.729
Yeah.

29:57.889 --> 29:58.110
Really?

29:58.310 --> 29:58.710
Yeah.

29:59.972 --> 30:03.957
Because wasn't it forbidden in those days to do this, to do that?

30:04.458 --> 30:04.778
Yes.

30:05.299 --> 30:08.503
But that's how he did them, because he's invagual.

30:09.505 --> 30:14.431
And he had a good artist draw them, and they worked together, obviously.

30:15.793 --> 30:17.275
And that's magnificent.

30:18.016 --> 30:23.283
You're not going to see a better skeleton, do you?

30:23.323 --> 30:24.645
You're not going to see a better skeleton.

30:24.665 --> 30:26.888
Well, really, it's extremely accurate.

30:27.020 --> 30:34.310
That's very good.

30:34.830 --> 30:35.091
Yeah.

30:35.992 --> 30:36.673
Yeah.

30:36.693 --> 30:39.276
He must have had to do a lot of dissections to get that done.

30:40.598 --> 30:40.698
Yeah.

30:40.718 --> 30:44.162
And kept careful records and checked them all the next time.

30:44.903 --> 30:45.124
Yeah.

30:46.365 --> 30:53.675
Well, here are all these muscle men, so called.

30:53.775 --> 30:56.338
Is that pretty accurate by the muscles too?

30:56.418 --> 30:56.959
Yeah.

30:57.344 --> 30:58.565
It's also like an art, too.

30:58.585 --> 31:00.868
It's a beauty of the human art.

31:00.888 --> 31:01.529
Isn't that beautiful?

31:01.549 --> 31:01.869
It is beautiful.

31:01.889 --> 31:03.771
You can see that they're graceful there.

31:03.791 --> 31:04.912
It's not just anatomy.

31:05.193 --> 31:05.913
You can see more.

31:06.334 --> 31:10.138
And they're all labeled with the group letter.

31:10.759 --> 31:16.185
And of course, because it's a wood block, they had to do it in reverse.

31:16.465 --> 31:19.768
So there's a technical... Well, that didn't matter.

31:20.469 --> 31:22.151
You did it.

31:22.191 --> 31:23.993
So the guys walk in the other direction.

31:24.968 --> 31:26.390
Because the engraver would take care of that.

31:26.410 --> 31:27.973
The engraver could take care of that.

31:30.557 --> 31:33.622
These wood blocks were used in 1546.

31:33.642 --> 31:42.376
1543, 42, 46 was the second edition.

31:44.238 --> 31:51.550
And he was in—I would say this by that time was in the Army, taking care of Charles I, I think it was.

31:52.137 --> 31:53.318
He was his physician.

31:53.579 --> 31:54.580
He'd made it, you see.

31:54.780 --> 31:56.482
It was quite a job.

31:57.683 --> 32:15.683
And he finally, at the age of his 40s here, in his 60s, he had done something naughty and was sentenced to go the holy land to expiate his sins, which he did.

32:16.624 --> 32:21.790
And on his way back home, the ship was called The Storm Road at the age of 64.

32:22.630 --> 32:26.556
But this is where you look behind.

32:27.718 --> 32:31.864
This is excellent, you know?

32:31.884 --> 32:33.466
What did you feel the first time you saw this?

32:33.887 --> 32:35.008
Exciting.

32:35.549 --> 32:37.672
Well, these are things that we've seen.

32:38.414 --> 32:40.757
Reproductions of this were forever.

32:41.959 --> 32:44.903
So, the absolute beauty of this.

32:46.606 --> 32:52.114
Well, what happened then was the second edition

32:52.668 --> 33:00.457
New blocks disappeared in 1931, and somebody found the goddammit.

33:00.698 --> 33:01.318
You're kidding.

33:01.338 --> 33:03.000
They turned it up again.

33:03.101 --> 33:05.243
After 400 years or so, close.

33:05.443 --> 33:09.468
Yeah.

33:09.488 --> 33:10.009
Oh, my goodness.

33:10.109 --> 33:13.753
And here is the last edition of Lissanius.

33:13.773 --> 33:15.656
That's what it's called, Lissanius, right?

33:15.776 --> 33:16.016
Yeah.

33:16.997 --> 33:19.580
The E-S-A-L-I-I on there.

33:19.600 --> 33:21.763
Can I help you with that?

33:22.402 --> 33:36.022
This was down in 1932.

33:36.583 --> 33:43.213
Liza was done with the same blocks.

33:43.273 --> 33:44.435
Same wood blocks.

33:44.455 --> 33:44.635
Yeah.

33:46.077 --> 33:50.704
After 400 years or close, they used the same blocks.

33:51.832 --> 33:52.973
That's the first edition.

33:53.473 --> 33:55.475
The second edition, this guy's got clothes on.

33:55.515 --> 33:59.038
So this one's gone over again.

33:59.058 --> 34:00.219
They made him put clothes on him.

34:00.259 --> 34:01.140
Isn't that wonderful?

34:02.401 --> 34:05.904
The reason, of course, as you say, this is a bull.

34:12.690 --> 34:16.073
That must have been pretty exciting when the wood blocks turned up.

34:16.093 --> 34:18.456
Oh, God.

34:19.116 --> 34:20.117
I wonder where they had been.

34:20.722 --> 34:22.585
Somebody knew, I don't know, so I forget.

34:23.727 --> 34:25.089
Look at that, huh?

34:25.189 --> 34:26.471
Doesn't that look the same?

34:26.491 --> 34:27.332
Because it should.

34:27.352 --> 34:32.840
It was the same goddamn woodcloth.

34:32.860 --> 34:35.384
Well, this must have been done in a very early edition.

34:35.645 --> 34:38.489
I mean, a very limited edition, I mean.

34:38.769 --> 34:42.615
No, this was a pretty extensive edition.

34:46.000 --> 34:50.307
Oh, yeah, this is modern paper, beautiful paper.

34:50.658 --> 35:03.197
I'm sorry?

35:03.697 --> 35:05.039
The wood blocks were destroyed then.

35:05.320 --> 35:07.262
So the wood blocks were destroyed during the war.

35:08.124 --> 35:10.668
They said a thousand copies were made of this.

35:14.934 --> 35:19.821
So they were discovered to be preserved and saved and then they were destroyed in World War II.

35:20.746 --> 35:22.087
Isn't that a commentary, huh?

35:22.548 --> 35:22.688
Mm-hmm.

35:24.870 --> 35:36.622
And it's an exciting thing to look through these videos.

35:36.642 --> 35:37.563
We saw that one.

35:37.964 --> 35:39.565
Yeah.

35:39.585 --> 35:40.927
It looks familiar.

35:41.727 --> 35:43.549
Is this still among your favorites?

35:43.569 --> 35:44.350
Oh, yeah.

35:44.370 --> 35:46.893
The first is the favorite, right?

35:46.913 --> 35:48.855
The first acquisition is still the favorite.

35:48.875 --> 35:50.196
Also, that has to be.

35:51.323 --> 35:56.728
Now, would you also judge that as one of the high spots of your collection?

35:56.748 --> 35:59.590
Oh, for sure.

35:59.610 --> 36:00.611
Now, let me show you.

36:02.513 --> 36:04.895
Is that right?

36:06.256 --> 36:10.700
No, that's all right.

36:10.720 --> 36:11.481
That's the end.

36:11.501 --> 36:14.384
I told you it was a French, and that was too.

36:16.285 --> 36:21.330
Couldn't publish for five years because he was being sued.

36:21.715 --> 36:22.796
All right, yeah.

36:24.078 --> 36:33.692
And this is his book.

36:33.712 --> 36:35.194
His family were publishing things.

36:35.574 --> 36:37.156
They were publishing?

36:37.176 --> 36:38.498
Yeah, that's wonderful.

36:38.518 --> 36:41.783
1546, yeah.

36:45.228 --> 36:47.150
And I think it's a pen out of the way.

36:48.332 --> 36:48.512
Yeah.

36:49.594 --> 36:50.575
Look, it's a little Latin.

36:53.879 --> 36:55.581
It's pretty thoroughly indexed for the period.

36:55.681 --> 36:56.282
Oh, yes.

36:56.302 --> 36:57.003
Look at that.

36:57.244 --> 37:00.828
But look at the difference between that skeleton and what you just looked at.

37:02.631 --> 37:03.552
Now, the bones are right.

37:04.173 --> 37:05.054
It's not as complete.

37:05.114 --> 37:06.937
He doesn't have any bones here.

37:07.377 --> 37:07.738
No.

37:08.158 --> 37:09.240
The toes look like toes.

37:09.280 --> 37:09.681
Yeah.

37:09.981 --> 37:11.223
They look like they've got flesh on them.

37:11.503 --> 37:13.245
Does this look back like the other one?

37:13.265 --> 37:15.088
That thing was a beautiful thing.

37:15.508 --> 37:16.249
No, this is more.

37:16.270 --> 37:16.390
Yeah.

37:17.171 --> 37:20.555
The other one is great.

37:20.655 --> 37:21.777
Yeah.

37:22.988 --> 37:26.673
I can't believe how beautiful the paper is.

37:27.154 --> 37:29.017
Well, yeah, this is good paper.

37:30.279 --> 37:32.602
Well, that's rudimentary, isn't it?

37:32.802 --> 37:34.825
Compared to the series.

37:35.066 --> 37:35.967
And who is this again?

37:36.448 --> 37:37.309
This is Estienne.

37:37.649 --> 37:38.210
Estienne.

37:39.212 --> 37:41.435
And it was a great, important publishing house.

37:41.595 --> 37:46.983
And Charles Estienne was a great publisher.

37:47.644 --> 37:50.548
Except the young soul was his partner on these.

37:50.866 --> 37:51.847
The deepness.

37:51.868 --> 37:52.589
Is it French?

37:52.869 --> 37:53.530
Yeah.

37:53.590 --> 37:56.815
I mean, I need this book.

37:56.835 --> 37:57.296
Isn't it funny?

37:57.316 --> 37:59.098
This book's very rudimentary.

37:59.118 --> 37:59.379
Is it?

37:59.399 --> 37:59.779
Yes.

38:02.964 --> 38:07.411
This was done before Viserius, really.

38:07.832 --> 38:10.455
Was Viserius the full-outrate book on anatomy then?

38:12.358 --> 38:15.042
Yeah.

38:15.062 --> 38:16.244
I mean, that's a fair statement.

38:17.166 --> 38:20.130
So it's really the cornerstone of such a collection.

38:20.600 --> 38:22.422
In anatomy, yes.

38:23.143 --> 38:27.149
But, you know, they knew these parts.

38:28.150 --> 38:31.054
They knew the bones because they got broken.

38:32.055 --> 38:37.202
They knew the blood vessels where they were because they got a spiel wound and they bled.

38:42.429 --> 38:47.256
But they wouldn't let them do deceptions, you know.

38:47.276 --> 38:49.138
They got in trouble with the church, yeah.

38:50.384 --> 38:56.272
My God, what is that?

38:56.632 --> 38:58.595
That's to show you the brain.

38:59.196 --> 39:01.158
The rest of it doesn't count.

39:01.178 --> 39:03.742
It doesn't make sense either, does it?

39:03.762 --> 39:04.863
It just looks like bloody parts.

39:05.304 --> 39:08.208
The rest is merely the housing for the brain.

39:10.070 --> 39:10.871
Here's the usuals.

39:11.913 --> 39:17.320
Forget all this.

39:18.059 --> 39:19.681
Now, how is he for accuracy?

39:19.721 --> 39:21.543
Technically, not so much for the eyes.

39:21.563 --> 39:24.907
He's got all the white parts, but they're not put together right.

39:25.228 --> 39:26.890
You know, like that.

39:33.277 --> 39:34.799
So, that's the end.

39:34.819 --> 39:40.226
As I say, it would have been first if he had been able to do it.

39:40.246 --> 39:43.830
And somewhere there I've got to...

39:44.249 --> 39:47.173
Are those anatomical studies by da Vinci?

39:47.373 --> 39:49.336
Oh, there's no.

39:50.778 --> 40:09.143
Da Vinci, his years were... You don't have to take that down, sir.

40:17.577 --> 40:25.849
I was probably writing in the Navajo book.

40:25.869 --> 40:27.912
At least it makes sense to think so.

40:30.235 --> 40:36.765
And these are the... These are facsimiles.

40:37.065 --> 40:39.369
Well, the green ones are the originals, I'd like.

40:39.849 --> 40:41.672
But these are from the collection.

40:45.778 --> 40:47.280
And I can tell you, they look as good.

40:48.003 --> 41:01.021
He would take a piece of paper and he'd start thinking about man.

41:02.223 --> 41:03.845
Then he'd draw some part of the body.

41:06.889 --> 41:10.534
So you'll see everything here.

41:19.137 --> 41:22.180
Sort of vaguely.

41:29.348 --> 41:44.463
And these are... Now this doesn't look so good, except this is a bear foot.

41:44.483 --> 41:46.705
It is a bear foot.

41:46.725 --> 41:48.267
Bears, not humans.

41:49.158 --> 41:52.864
But you got in trouble for this too, didn't you, didn't you?

41:54.105 --> 41:56.169
Well, I think you were in trouble all the time.

41:58.753 --> 42:02.578
But some of these are really magnificent.

42:02.598 --> 42:03.840
Did you say you saw the originals?

42:04.581 --> 42:04.922
No.

42:04.942 --> 42:07.586
But many of them were here.

42:07.946 --> 42:09.329
These were in the L.A.

42:10.070 --> 42:16.920
and show the Windsor Art collection.

42:18.537 --> 42:22.904
Can you write backwards on these, or is it in the mirror?

42:22.944 --> 42:32.420
No, this is... Well, he wrote, and nobody could ever figure this out, and somebody would tell them something in the mirror.

42:33.823 --> 42:34.564
Yes, I love that.

42:35.305 --> 42:37.609
He'd have gotten in trouble if they knew what he was writing for.

42:38.731 --> 42:41.095
But he based his dance or something?

42:41.956 --> 42:42.958
Yeah, he did his painting.

42:44.845 --> 42:47.609
But obviously he was a genius and he was interested in anatomy.

42:47.629 --> 42:51.115
I mean, you didn't need that stuff there for paintings and spatularies.

42:51.135 --> 42:51.736
And sculpture.

42:52.377 --> 42:57.324
Especially the intestines here?

42:57.484 --> 42:58.326
Yeah.

42:58.346 --> 43:00.669
It's a beautiful body.

43:01.671 --> 43:08.461
It's a beautiful body.

43:08.481 --> 43:09.503
It's pretty nice.

43:12.115 --> 43:14.498
When was this produced, this facsimile addition?

43:14.738 --> 43:21.307
Again, these were found not too long, though, and this was some time ago.

43:21.327 --> 43:24.090
Well, you know, they were in Windsor, in the trunk.

43:25.612 --> 43:26.894
In the trunk?

43:26.914 --> 43:27.134
Yeah.

43:27.255 --> 43:32.201
And the Queen didn't ever saw them until somebody went and opened the goddamn trunk.

43:32.221 --> 43:34.304
You mean the existing Queen, the current Queen?

43:34.324 --> 43:34.524
No.

43:34.544 --> 43:35.946
This was Victoria, perhaps.

43:36.486 --> 43:38.990
Oh, I think it was after Victoria.

43:39.010 --> 43:40.652
They owned them, and they didn't know they owned them.

43:40.672 --> 43:40.772
Yeah.

43:41.815 --> 43:46.260
They had a guy go to Europe and buy all kinds of art.

43:48.403 --> 43:49.384
School things, you know?

43:50.466 --> 43:56.433
That's a pretty damn good skeleton.

43:56.453 --> 43:59.076
Yes, well.

43:59.637 --> 44:06.525
That's a pretty damn nice looking foot leg.

44:06.825 --> 44:10.590
That's a nice foot, nice calf, nice shoe.

44:11.752 --> 44:16.218
Well, here's a design for a house.

44:16.238 --> 44:18.642
I don't know what Matthew was doing.

44:18.662 --> 44:20.865
I'm amazed these things survived.

44:20.885 --> 44:24.550
This is the kind of thing that usually never made it through time.

44:25.392 --> 44:29.818
But look at them.

44:29.838 --> 44:30.859
These things never made it.

44:30.880 --> 44:33.603
I mean, notes and, I mean, like Shakespeare.

44:33.623 --> 44:35.566
There's nothing from Shakespeare that's, you know.

44:35.967 --> 44:37.729
But these were not important.

44:37.749 --> 44:40.273
Well, I'm amazed that they did survive, though.

44:41.367 --> 44:43.850
Look at that.

44:43.870 --> 44:45.111
That's a pretty darn good figure.

44:48.995 --> 45:06.092
Well, these are Linda's collection that the Queen has now, and she has had them travel around, and as I said, they were here, and they'll go back to the country.

45:10.122 --> 45:13.525
Is there anything that you'd like to have that you've been unable to get?

45:13.926 --> 45:15.507
Can you think of anything specific?

45:15.567 --> 45:19.010
Well, you know, there's always something.

45:19.951 --> 45:23.715
But let me show you some of the earliest things.

45:23.735 --> 45:27.919
I don't know how much fun you have.

45:27.939 --> 45:31.142
You know, my wife's a librarian.

45:31.923 --> 45:39.690
She, after our kids, we all came along.

45:40.008 --> 45:44.594
and everything was fine.

45:45.175 --> 45:55.528
She went to library school, and she's now a librarian at Southern California Psycho Home of New York City.

45:55.548 --> 45:58.292
So you share the passion?

45:58.312 --> 45:59.573
Does she share your passion?

45:59.774 --> 46:00.795
Not special.

46:00.815 --> 46:01.916
I mean, she's interested.

46:02.417 --> 46:06.943
She buys lots of books, but that's the one she's reading.

46:07.413 --> 46:10.458
She hasn't buy them an artifact, no, this day, no.

46:11.279 --> 46:26.743
But, well, here, let me show you the most important book in my book, The Beginning of Modern Medicine.

46:26.763 --> 46:30.830
The circulation was a real mystery.

46:30.850 --> 46:34.315
Blood came from the legs, went up to the liver,

46:35.898 --> 46:40.783
and then from the liver it went to a heart, and then went through.

46:42.005 --> 46:45.368
Where it got to a run, I'm not sure.

46:46.269 --> 46:48.291
William Harvey, 1621.

46:50.754 --> 46:57.321
I think that this is the only one in private head ends this time.

46:58.262 --> 47:01.225
Now we're getting to the really extraordinary stuff.

47:02.346 --> 47:04.909
This is his... Oh, I like this now.

47:05.682 --> 47:13.390
The Emoto Cordes was published in 1628.

47:16.354 --> 47:18.936
He has illustrations.

47:22.200 --> 47:25.243
Now, see, what he did was this.

47:25.824 --> 47:34.373
If you put a turn of it here, if you don't put it very tight, then the blood goes down and comes back in the veins.

47:35.568 --> 47:39.895
And it stops at these places.

47:41.197 --> 47:45.885
And if you do it and you go like this, you push it out.

47:45.905 --> 47:49.651
And eventually you now fill, but they stop.

47:49.691 --> 47:54.779
So these are valves in the veins that let the blood go only this way.

47:56.682 --> 48:01.390
So the blood normally has to flow this way to the heart, from the eye.

48:02.838 --> 48:04.080
Did Harvey understand this?

48:04.120 --> 48:04.541
Yeah.

48:04.561 --> 48:05.963
Is he the first to understand this?

48:06.443 --> 48:06.564
No.

48:06.584 --> 48:11.090
Cesar Pino was the first, but he didn't really know exactly what it meant.

48:12.312 --> 48:15.717
Harvey did a lot of things.

48:15.737 --> 48:25.191
He cut a chick and the egg, and about the seventh day or whatever, I forget, he'd open the egg and look.

48:25.211 --> 48:29.638
I've done this with my daughter, and you see the office.

48:30.057 --> 48:33.420
Blood going in this way and going out that way and going one direction.

48:33.440 --> 48:35.922
You can't mistake it.

48:35.942 --> 48:37.123
And he looked fish.

48:38.344 --> 48:42.568
And he did tied ligatures around different parts.

48:42.588 --> 48:48.553
And if he tied them to vessels that go to the heart, this all flooded.

48:48.633 --> 48:49.454
That became empty.

48:50.715 --> 48:53.337
The valves of the heart let the blood go in one direction.

48:54.058 --> 48:56.320
He took the heart out of the dog and saw it.

48:58.282 --> 48:59.963
You know, it would go only one way.

49:01.023 --> 49:06.411
so that any child ligatures and did all kinds of experiments, it's an occupational.

49:06.431 --> 49:07.993
And no one had done that.

49:10.557 --> 49:12.639
This is a seminal book, the Master of Medicine.

49:12.840 --> 49:18.408
This, as I say, this is the first book in modern medicine.

49:18.828 --> 49:23.355
This is the beginning of medicine, as we know.

49:23.375 --> 49:25.057
And yet the Vasari is your favorite, though.

49:26.539 --> 49:30.625
That's the beginning of...

49:32.005 --> 49:33.407
That's the only one in private hands.

49:34.469 --> 49:37.174
So far as I know that.

49:37.534 --> 49:41.100
Did you get that through a bookseller or at auction?

49:42.362 --> 49:43.064
Jake Zeglin.

49:43.184 --> 49:47.772
Jake saw it at the auction and he bought it.

49:49.695 --> 49:54.563
He didn't know it was coming up and he called me from wherever the auction was.

49:54.583 --> 49:54.823
Really?

49:55.224 --> 49:56.967
And said, are you interested?

49:59.056 --> 50:02.802
In general terms, did you give him a limit or did you just say get it?

50:03.703 --> 50:04.805
I didn't buy it.

50:04.865 --> 50:05.426
He bought it.

50:06.087 --> 50:07.810
He had already acquired it.

50:09.993 --> 50:10.454
I see.

50:13.558 --> 50:15.241
Let's look at earlier medicine.

50:16.984 --> 50:23.333
It's a better collection.

50:24.135 --> 50:26.278
I'm doing some things with it because the

50:26.680 --> 50:37.673
UCLA is going to have a year's program when the year Columbus discovered it in America.

50:37.753 --> 50:44.120
And this is what medicine is like in 1492.

50:45.542 --> 50:54.272
This herbal was made something around 1492.

50:54.292 --> 50:55.033
What's an herbal?

50:55.773 --> 50:56.174
Yeah.

50:56.194 --> 50:56.855
Is it Spanish?

50:57.717 --> 50:59.320
This is Latin.

50:59.360 --> 51:02.627
This is old Italian.

51:05.713 --> 51:11.384
And here... Can I look at that thing?

51:11.484 --> 51:11.745
Well, yeah.

51:11.845 --> 51:13.588
It's hard to look like that.

51:13.609 --> 51:17.376
Because you're drawing through something potent.

51:18.132 --> 51:20.534
Once you got that old boy, could you cure him?

51:20.554 --> 51:23.637
Do you think this was for the use of apothecaries or a pharmacist?

51:23.657 --> 51:28.141
So this was... What the hell do you mean the office?

51:28.181 --> 51:30.723
Because he had the old baby, he had all the jars.

51:31.924 --> 51:34.006
So this was like a recipe book or whatever.

51:35.067 --> 51:36.728
Well, here, let me read some of these.

51:39.211 --> 51:41.913
This girl who's at the Gettys.

51:43.014 --> 51:44.996
She works at the Gettys.

51:45.216 --> 51:46.357
She is a translator.

51:46.377 --> 51:47.498
She's a wife.

51:47.866 --> 51:56.460
To heal any old wound, take the leaves and the root of this herb and make a powder of them and place it in the wound.

51:57.382 --> 51:59.566
It will quickly cause it to purge and to heal.

52:00.527 --> 52:06.457
Similarly, a woman with an illness of the wound should eat and drink of this herb for a period of 30 days and she will be cured.

52:07.519 --> 52:14.110
Similarly, for a person who has been bitten by a snake or other venomous animal, take this herb and crush it and place it in the wound and it will soon heal.

52:14.765 --> 52:15.466
And so on.

52:15.486 --> 52:16.147
What was the herb?

52:16.407 --> 52:17.268
That sounds like a tree.

52:17.409 --> 52:18.210
Well, let's see.

52:18.230 --> 52:19.391
Which is this?

52:19.732 --> 52:20.233
What about?

52:20.313 --> 52:20.933
This is one.

52:22.656 --> 52:23.938
This is the first in the book.

52:24.619 --> 52:25.760
Yeah, the real miracle drug.

52:28.264 --> 52:29.265
Yeah, there.

52:30.106 --> 52:30.967
I don't know what it is.

52:32.609 --> 52:35.554
You can make something out of it.

52:35.894 --> 52:37.857
I'd like to have some of that.

52:38.297 --> 52:39.419
Yeah, wouldn't that be mine?

52:39.579 --> 52:40.300
Take care of everything.

52:41.123 --> 52:45.249
And this side is also... Look at the face.

52:45.309 --> 52:47.251
That's wonderful.

52:47.672 --> 52:57.966
And here is, page 19, the most potent of the lot.

52:57.986 --> 52:58.827
Look at the dog.

52:58.967 --> 53:03.673
I wonder why... The Moondrake is a powerful drug.

53:04.655 --> 53:07.839
And if you were to dig it up, pull it out.

53:09.902 --> 53:10.202
Julie?

53:11.684 --> 53:21.697
So they dig it out, clean it, tie it to a dog.

53:21.817 --> 53:22.939
The dog would pull it out.

53:23.419 --> 53:24.261
You haven't?

53:24.281 --> 53:26.103
You haven't.

53:28.306 --> 53:31.831
The main thing.

53:32.031 --> 53:33.292
There he is.

53:33.333 --> 53:33.693
That's it.

53:34.073 --> 53:35.095
You know, look at it.

53:35.115 --> 53:35.956
It's all different.

53:35.976 --> 53:39.801
The Chinese are using the...

53:41.502 --> 53:53.300
So, these are magical, great, I don't know, I never saw faces like that.

53:53.320 --> 53:54.782
I never saw loops like that either.

53:55.944 --> 54:10.986
But this was in use until recent times, apparently, in the story that the bookseller had, which I don't know how true it is, was that the doctor who used this, telling her who was

54:11.405 --> 54:18.735
35, 35, and when he died, his son was interested in medicine.

54:18.755 --> 54:20.197
The son was interested in medicine.

54:20.217 --> 54:21.298
After many generations.

54:21.379 --> 54:24.683
After many generations of these things.

54:24.703 --> 54:30.972
So this is... I've got an earlier award.

54:30.992 --> 54:32.233
This is quite a collection.

54:34.536 --> 54:36.779
Now, Grey's Anatomy, you've heard about.

54:36.799 --> 54:40.905
Cezalfini is a guy who got the idea of circulation of blood.

54:41.375 --> 55:07.855
C-A-E-S-A-L-P-I-N-I-S-A-L-P-I-N-I-S-A-L-P-I-S-A-L-P-I-S-A-L-P-I-S-A-L-P-I-S-A-L-P-I-S-A-L-P-I-S-A-L-P-I-S-A-L-P-I-S-A-L-P-I-S-A-L-P-I-S-A-L-P-I-S-A-L-P-I-S-A-L-P-I-S-A-L-P-I-S-A-L-P-I-S-A-L-P-I-S-A-L-P-I-S-A-L-P-I-S-A-L-P-I-

55:08.459 --> 55:11.483
Do you believe, personally, there's a validity to these things?

55:12.485 --> 55:14.147
What, modern African validity?

55:14.388 --> 55:15.850
Well, can I tell you something?

55:17.612 --> 55:18.734
No.

55:18.754 --> 55:19.295
No?

55:20.256 --> 55:23.782
By accident, they married a different one.

55:23.802 --> 55:26.806
But they didn't know what it was before.

55:26.826 --> 55:33.035
And again, if you remember that you almost always be covered when you get sick.

55:33.055 --> 55:36.981
And you take some of these things.

55:38.311 --> 55:39.212
Almost always.

55:39.833 --> 55:41.835
Well, that's interesting.

55:41.855 --> 55:47.162
I've lost patience, too.

55:47.302 --> 55:49.965
This is a little earlier.

55:50.726 --> 55:50.926
Wow.

55:51.327 --> 55:54.090
This is about 1350 or so.

55:54.110 --> 55:55.752
1350.

55:55.932 --> 55:56.112
Yeah.

55:58.575 --> 56:02.460
So we're talking, wow.

56:03.121 --> 56:04.042
Well, 1550.

56:04.062 --> 56:06.765
1450.

56:09.007 --> 56:15.853
Now, you can't really recognize it.

56:16.294 --> 56:18.836
The name maybe would help you.

56:18.856 --> 56:20.858
What's the origin, Doctor?

56:20.998 --> 56:22.159
Where is this from?

56:22.940 --> 56:24.001
This is Italy.

56:24.021 --> 56:26.143
This is in Latin.

56:26.363 --> 56:28.325
They didn't use Italian.

56:28.885 --> 56:32.769
By that time, they weren't probably using Italian.

56:32.789 --> 56:34.891
Something like that has to be exceedingly scarce.

56:35.091 --> 56:37.613
Where do you come up with the 14th century herbal, you know?

56:37.930 --> 56:39.392
Well, I'll tell you.

56:41.275 --> 56:43.678
You'd be amazed how they know about me.

56:43.698 --> 56:45.400
Oh, I'm sure they'll have.

56:45.420 --> 56:47.583
Well, let me show you a couple other things.

56:48.705 --> 57:06.790
This is the works of Arnaud, the building of the building of the building of the building of the building of the building of the building of the building of the building of the building of the building.

57:07.782 --> 57:10.125
who used this for his textbook.

57:10.185 --> 57:10.806
Magnificent.

57:11.507 --> 57:15.793
And this was, of course, a manuscript written by hand with notes.

57:17.115 --> 57:18.396
Printing wasn't known then.

57:18.897 --> 57:19.518
On vellum.

57:21.200 --> 57:30.272
And a friend of mine, who was a medieval scholar, got a hold of this and looked through it.

57:30.292 --> 57:33.176
What's that, he said.

57:33.196 --> 57:35.139
Somebody had written something there and erased it.

57:36.761 --> 57:36.861
Okay.

57:37.752 --> 57:41.977
So he took it, ultraviolet, oh, this is this one, this one.

57:41.997 --> 57:45.822
So he took it, well, ultraviolet liked it, all kinds of different likes.

57:48.005 --> 57:50.789
You couldn't pick it up at all?

57:50.809 --> 57:54.794
Well, John Benton taught medieval history of Caltech.

57:57.337 --> 58:01.483
When he died, they abolished his apartment.

58:01.503 --> 58:03.285
Oh, my goodness.

58:03.305 --> 58:07.170
So he is important to us because of his other interests.

58:07.190 --> 58:07.270
Yes.

58:07.503 --> 58:13.612
Anyway, here are different pictures of that.

58:19.500 --> 58:22.724
The ultraviolet light is what I needed.

58:22.744 --> 58:26.710
Finally, they pulled it out there, didn't they, huh?

58:27.711 --> 58:32.979
Well, it came up some with ultraviolet.

58:33.600 --> 58:36.844
There's one I want to show you.

58:36.864 --> 58:37.425
Well, here it is.

58:38.705 --> 58:55.482
What they did here was the people at Caltech got one of these lousy pictures, and using their image intensifier, which they used to read the Dead Sea Scrolls and all kinds of things which you can't see, they did that.

58:56.623 --> 59:01.088
And this was a student of Browns who studied from this book and owned it.

59:02.229 --> 59:05.252
And he put it up.

59:05.941 --> 59:10.306
He didn't want anybody to know that he had done that, so he wasted it.

59:12.669 --> 59:16.233
Yes, but it was all this important information, really.

59:17.154 --> 59:22.701
But now they're using this computer thing.

59:22.841 --> 59:23.622
How old was that?

59:23.762 --> 59:28.488
Well, it was after 1320.

59:28.568 --> 59:35.256
I don't know what year.

59:36.518 --> 59:40.003
This is a manuscript that made 1,300.

59:40.123 --> 59:40.704
Wow.

59:40.724 --> 59:46.292
It's a very important collection.

59:46.392 --> 59:48.455
I don't want to take up too much more of your time.

59:48.515 --> 59:56.287
I think we'd like to ask you a couple of fast questions, because I know you've had a busy day, and you certainly don't want to overstay a welcome.

59:57.248 --> 01:00:01.314
But I've noticed that so many physicians are book collectors.

01:00:02.095 --> 01:00:04.398
Can you have any explanation of what I feel for that?

01:00:04.859 --> 01:00:05.580
I think so.

01:00:06.742 --> 01:00:13.230
Uh, hang on.

01:00:13.251 --> 01:00:17.256
Any self-respectful lady.

01:00:17.276 --> 01:00:20.400
Well, this is 1210.

01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:21.341
1210?

01:00:21.361 --> 01:00:22.423
Yeah, about.

01:00:22.443 --> 01:00:32.295
We carried this around with her because this tells her all the things the players to say, depending on the year, so she plays properly.

01:00:33.677 --> 01:00:35.820
And all kinds of things to do.

01:00:35.986 --> 01:00:36.949
Somebody's sick.

01:00:40.077 --> 01:00:41.781
Is that a book of ours?

01:00:41.882 --> 01:00:46.654
Oh, look at that.
