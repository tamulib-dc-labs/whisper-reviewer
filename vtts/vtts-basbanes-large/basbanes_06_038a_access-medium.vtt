WEBVTT

00:02.630 --> 00:03.671
All right.

00:03.691 --> 00:04.813
We're talking with Paul Gale.

00:04.833 --> 00:06.776
We're at the Newbury Library in Chicago.

00:07.657 --> 00:09.620
It's October 4th, 1990.

00:10.941 --> 00:14.787
And I guess we're here to talk about a collection.

00:15.428 --> 00:23.238
I think you said downstairs that this has often been described as a collection of collectors as opposed to a collection of collections.

00:23.399 --> 00:31.590
Well, it's usually called a collection of collections, but I think of it more as a collection of collectors in a way because from the beginning,

00:32.549 --> 00:44.488
the Newberry staff has looked for private collectors whose efforts would help in the building of the collection.

00:44.508 --> 00:57.328
I think almost all major research libraries nowadays do this, and I think the great multi-layered collections like New York Public have been doing it for a century or more.

00:59.592 --> 01:00.413
But

01:01.253 --> 01:09.221
It's something that, in some ways, I suppose people in the profession don't talk about because it seems so mercenary, when in fact it's a public education effort.

01:09.241 --> 01:13.545
What you get out of it ultimately is a collection that comes into public hands.

01:13.626 --> 01:25.978
But in the meantime, it allows people in a library like the Newberry or Harvard, Roger Snyder certainly does plenty of this, to work with collectors, let them learn from the expertise of the staff,

01:26.600 --> 01:34.748
get advice and help from staff members on how to buy and what to buy, what's interesting, what's important.

01:36.169 --> 01:38.111
Kind of with an eye to the future, too, do you think?

01:40.053 --> 01:42.916
Well, it works both ways.

01:42.956 --> 01:50.283
I mean, we're looking at you cultivate donors for the sake of donations, but also for the sake of teaching them something.

01:50.984 --> 01:54.868
And even more important, and this is what kind of worries me sometimes, is that the

01:55.507 --> 02:02.238
the tradition of philanthropy in book terms is dying out in this country, or it seems to be.

02:03.480 --> 02:10.431
We don't have the kind of broad-based interest in the library's programs that we had 100 years ago.

02:10.451 --> 02:15.138
100 years ago, there would be 20 and 30,000 people come through the doors at the Newberry every year.

02:15.158 --> 02:22.510
Now, that doesn't mean 20 or 30,000 potential donors, but a larger number of those people were interested

02:23.080 --> 02:28.585
and getting something out of the public education efforts of the library than any popular library does today.

02:28.605 --> 02:34.812
This is true not only of libraries, but the peak, for example, for museum attendance in Chicago was in the 1930s.

02:34.952 --> 02:38.595
It was before people had videos and radio.

02:38.835 --> 02:40.157
They had radio, but they didn't have television.

02:40.177 --> 02:41.538
They didn't have home entertainment.

02:42.239 --> 02:44.041
And so for entertainment, they went to museums.

02:44.521 --> 02:47.003
And in those days, the museums were all free.

02:47.064 --> 02:50.607
Now you have to pay to get in.

02:51.127 --> 03:08.352
One of the things I think we do is to educate people to cultivate interests in books and educate them to cultivate a public interest in books, that is, in collecting books for the larger public.

03:09.434 --> 03:12.118
And I don't think we're doing a bad job of it.

03:12.158 --> 03:19.108
I think that we just have to pay attention to it as a process because it isn't something that you can let go.

03:20.000 --> 03:42.325
It may just be my post-1980s depression that I'm worrying that, you know, a whole group of newly rich people came along in the 1980s who haven't been encouraged in particular to be interested in classical music or in classical cultural activities of other sorts as well.

03:43.546 --> 03:49.112
And who were in fact encouraged by the book dealers in the 80s

03:49.767 --> 03:53.711
to collect for investment purposes, which is not a good reason to collect.

03:53.751 --> 04:01.699
You should collect for your own personal interest, and if you can add to that a public interest, that's great, a public service interest.

04:01.799 --> 04:06.524
It is interesting, and maybe it's kind of a, maybe there is a contradiction here.

04:07.805 --> 04:13.350
Book collecting has ever been more popular than it is, well, that probably has to be qualified.

04:13.731 --> 04:15.893
I think it's become a more democratic pursuit.

04:16.514 --> 04:19.559
It's not strictly a pursuit of the very wealthy.

04:19.699 --> 04:20.320
No, that's fine.

04:20.360 --> 04:21.182
I think that's great.

04:22.103 --> 04:32.420
But on the other hand, you say you don't really see this kind of philanthropic intensity that is characterized collection development in places like that.

04:32.440 --> 04:42.336
I don't see very many people doing what, say, Alfred Hamill, who was the president of the Newberry and one of the trustees from

04:42.856 --> 04:46.820
He was a trustee from the 20s, and he was president from 1931 until his death in 1953.

04:47.340 --> 04:48.381
H-A-M-I-L-L.

04:48.401 --> 04:50.643
No, it's H-A-M-I-L-L.

04:52.945 --> 05:11.462
I don't see people doing what he did, which was to create a calligraphy collection deliberately as a complement to an existing Newberry collection with the idea that his collection, there's only about 400 books, 500 books, would come to the Newberry in 1953 after his death as a

05:12.286 --> 05:16.109
a building upon a collection he had acquired for the Newberry.

05:16.129 --> 05:16.550
Which was?

05:16.850 --> 05:21.194
The Ricketts Collection, which is described a little bit in the exhibit downstairs.

05:21.834 --> 05:27.940
The Ricketts Collection was easily the most important collection on calligraphy in North America in the 19th century.

05:28.360 --> 05:29.461
Ricketts was an engrosser.

05:29.521 --> 05:36.547
That means he had a shop where they did handwriting and illuminating of certificates and all kinds of things for businesses.

05:36.647 --> 05:38.549
How do you spell engrosser?

05:38.929 --> 05:39.930
E-N-G-R-O-S-S-E-R.

05:41.451 --> 05:42.192
And...

05:42.813 --> 06:00.870
He ran this workshop from the 1880s on in Chicago and collected books on handwriting, everything from little penmanship books that were being used in the 19th century to the great monuments of calligraphic handwriting.

06:01.711 --> 06:11.740
That collection was offered as a block starting in the 1930s.

06:12.428 --> 06:21.377
Unfortunately, the Newberry trustees couldn't, I mean, it was the Depression, the Newberry trustees couldn't see their way clear to acquiring the collection as a block.

06:21.397 --> 06:22.358
So it was broken up.

06:23.539 --> 06:34.309
The bulk of the writing books, the technical material that had to do with handwriting and which was unduplicated anywhere, was bought by the trustees from the estate.

06:34.409 --> 06:35.390
I think the year was 41.

06:35.711 --> 06:41.136
And the remainder of the collection was dispersed

06:41.588 --> 06:48.537
The largest number of the manuscripts went to the lily, and you could ask to see the block of manuscripts that are in the lily.

06:50.720 --> 06:54.685
A sense of the importance of the Ricketts collection you can get out of de Ricci.

06:54.765 --> 06:57.649
Have you discovered the de Ricci manuscripts?

06:57.669 --> 07:05.278
And that's only the medieval manuscripts, but his collection goes on for pages and pages, and you can see how important it was.

07:05.359 --> 07:09.604
He was, however, collecting them as writing samples, as samples of handwriting, not as

07:10.327 --> 07:12.370
beautiful blocks, or for other reasons.

07:12.390 --> 07:14.613
You know, Samuel Pepys did the same kind of thing.

07:14.633 --> 07:16.355
Have you ever seen the Pepys?

07:16.415 --> 07:17.657
I was there last year, yeah.

07:17.857 --> 07:20.260
But there's a collection of calligraphy.

07:20.321 --> 07:20.961
Did you see that?

07:21.182 --> 07:22.263
I didn't see the calligraphy collection.

07:22.283 --> 07:25.147
I think it was Humphrey Winley was the one who collected it.

07:25.167 --> 07:25.508
Oh, really?

07:25.528 --> 07:25.768
Yeah.

07:25.948 --> 07:26.749
No, I didn't know that.

07:26.970 --> 07:29.473
Oh, I have to ask to see that next time.

07:31.135 --> 07:34.099
Richard Luckett showed me through that.

07:34.460 --> 07:37.083
Yeah, he's in that business.

07:37.143 --> 07:37.404
He's great.

07:37.464 --> 07:39.827
I would suggest, I would make a suggestion.

07:40.195 --> 07:42.278
I said, gee, he was a collector.

07:42.398 --> 07:43.500
And he said, no, he's not a collector.

07:44.181 --> 07:45.022
I said, well, he is.

07:45.062 --> 07:45.823
He said, please.

07:45.843 --> 07:46.964
He said, let's not be tedious.

07:47.085 --> 07:50.309
He said, let's not be tedious and boring.

07:50.329 --> 07:50.970
He said, listen.

07:50.990 --> 07:54.615
I said, shut up at that point.

07:55.016 --> 07:56.578
It was wonderful.

07:56.598 --> 07:58.040
But anyway, I'm sorry.

07:58.060 --> 08:07.333
But in any case, what I don't see happening, the point of the way we got off on this, is I don't see somebody like Hamill who collects for

08:08.950 --> 08:28.390
You don't see very many people who collect deliberately with the notion that their books will remain not a monument to themselves in a public collection, but a sort of working library that deliberately complements another library.

08:29.952 --> 08:32.194
We have a number of examples of this in Newberry History.

08:33.236 --> 08:37.540
You've probably read a little bit about the Ayer Collection, which is our American Indian collection.

08:38.296 --> 08:41.139
And that's complemented by two other collections.

08:41.339 --> 08:52.892
One is Graff, which is a collection of Western Americana, which was built by one of our trustees, Graff, who knew what was at the Newberry and was collecting what was not at the Newberry.

08:52.912 --> 08:55.275
It was intended to be a complementary collection.

08:55.956 --> 09:02.523
Similarly, Ayer has a Latin American component, which is mostly Mexican and Peruvian colonial material.

09:03.484 --> 09:06.868
And another one of our trustees, by the name of William Greenlee,

09:07.557 --> 09:09.599
was in the 20s and 30s and 40s.

09:10.220 --> 09:13.002
I think he died in the late 50s, maybe in the 60s.

09:13.082 --> 09:20.130
Anyway, he was collecting Brazilian material, which is a perfect complement to that.

09:20.190 --> 09:35.725
A group of collectors that collected around the library gathered around the library because there was a public in the staff and in the wider public for their collecting.

09:36.802 --> 09:41.629
constitute the collection of collectors that I think are at the core of the new brain.

09:42.070 --> 09:46.816
And, you know, I used the word earlier when we were talking where the library co-ops these people.

09:47.818 --> 09:51.763
That sounds more negative than I would like.

09:52.044 --> 09:55.188
That has maybe more negative connotations than I would like.

09:55.649 --> 10:03.400
It is what we're doing, because in a sense what we are doing is harnessing the energy of these people

10:04.021 --> 10:13.233
And in many cases, they're very considerable knowledge, because when you become a collector in a focused field, you become much more expert than the experts.

10:13.633 --> 10:16.076
Brady McTeague said exactly the same thing.

10:16.096 --> 10:24.267
He said, they do it with so much more taste, with so much more enthusiasm, and when they give it to you, it's fully formed.

10:24.427 --> 10:24.988
That's right.

10:25.068 --> 10:26.009
It's wonderful.

10:26.269 --> 10:28.692
And an area that you might never have collected on your own.

10:28.712 --> 10:29.053
Absolutely.

10:29.473 --> 10:30.855
And they include the things.

10:31.240 --> 10:42.172
that for one reason or another, usually because of the vagaries of academic fashion, are not collected by institutional collections.

10:42.272 --> 10:43.493
Because they're not considered scholarly.

10:43.553 --> 10:43.914
Sure.

10:44.675 --> 10:45.035
That's right.

10:45.375 --> 10:55.386
Years ago, most institutional collections didn't collect popular printing because it was ephemeral, it was small, it was hard and expensive and tedious to catalog.

10:56.387 --> 11:00.572
But the private collectors were collecting that stuff because it really is

11:01.210 --> 11:13.027
interesting, often very beautiful and fascinating, and it has a lot to say about particularly the spread of high culture ideas to popular culture theaters.

11:13.688 --> 11:24.703
And now, of course, in the last 25 years, last 30 years, American academics have suddenly decided that this is where it's at, that you only write social history if you can get a sense of what little people were interested in.

11:25.257 --> 11:35.550
And so you look for ballad sheets, and you look for posters, and you look for theater tickets, and all the ephemeral things that institutions didn't collect 30, 40 years ago.

11:35.810 --> 11:37.813
I work in Worcester, I think I mentioned to you.

11:37.833 --> 11:40.316
I'm the book editor for the Worcester Telegram.

11:40.336 --> 11:42.138
It's my day job.

11:42.158 --> 11:43.700
But we have the AAS in Worcester.

11:43.740 --> 11:44.761
And of course, that's a mecca.

11:45.802 --> 11:49.087
That has collected ephemera before it was ever known as that.

11:49.267 --> 11:53.492
Could you cite any collections which you have received

11:53.776 --> 11:57.662
As an example of what you just said.

11:58.123 --> 12:15.109
Yeah, after his death in the late 60s, we received from the estate of Will Ransom a very major collection of small press ephemera.

12:15.899 --> 12:26.490
Well, Ransom was the scholar bibliographer who worked on private presses in England and America, starting in the teens and twenties and working right up to his death.

12:26.510 --> 12:29.334
He did several, a series of bibliographies on private presses.

12:29.354 --> 12:30.715
That's without a knee on Ransom, right?

12:30.735 --> 12:32.177
That's right.

12:32.197 --> 12:33.298
It's just like Ransom.

12:33.778 --> 12:34.299
Like Harry.

12:34.379 --> 12:36.061
That's right.

12:36.942 --> 12:44.590
And he was never rich enough to buy the books, but he corresponded back and forth with all of the

12:45.734 --> 13:15.437
printers and kind of teased out from them lists of the things they had printed and even their ephemeral printing sometimes and then got them to give him the prospectuses for books and the advertisements and the catalogs and the Christmas cards and all of that is in an alphabetical sequence that he put together along with a parallel sequence we're indexing these now that's why they're sitting in my office a parallel sequence of his notes on every

13:16.042 --> 13:18.947
individual printer or paper maker.

13:18.987 --> 13:20.349
Dart Hunter was a paper maker.

13:21.591 --> 13:26.519
Dart Hunter in here is on the Huntington as a press.

13:26.899 --> 13:29.824
How does this collection give the scholar?

13:31.086 --> 13:32.368
A lot of people come to use it.

13:34.070 --> 13:42.083
Often it gives them the advertising press, the come on to collectors that a given press was developing.

13:42.468 --> 13:51.360
Or the prospectus might give them some of the physical information about a book they can't find or can't get a hold of that helps them fill out the picture.

13:52.762 --> 14:10.365
The other thing that's interesting about it is because Ransom was kind of an omnivore and was interested in a lot of many smaller presses that don't get written up anywhere else, he'll have a series of notes on something that really was very ephemeral.

14:10.784 --> 14:16.129
Chicago suburban press called The Vanishing Press, and it's literally nearly vanished.

14:16.950 --> 14:21.394
And yet the man who put it together had a lot of taste and a lot of flair and a hilarious sense of humor.

14:22.095 --> 14:29.782
And the books are interesting, and they're an interesting example of kind of American suburban culture in the 20s and 30s.

14:29.842 --> 14:34.747
And especially with your much stronger collections, they certainly do support.

14:35.668 --> 14:36.749
They throw in some gaps.

14:36.949 --> 14:37.129
Yeah.

14:37.149 --> 14:40.352
The other thing is because it's organized very rigidly and alphabetically.

14:40.889 --> 14:48.218
If I get a reference question, what can you tell me about E.S.

14:48.319 --> 14:49.400
Richardson, Jr.

14:49.700 --> 14:56.129
and the Vanishing Press, I can go right to a series of files and say, well, here's 75 miscellaneous facts.

14:56.149 --> 14:57.390
Maybe they'll add up to something.

14:58.772 --> 15:03.138
These books are full of newspaper clippings, and those are hard to come by.

15:04.119 --> 15:09.546
Little small town press articles particularly, unless you knew

15:09.982 --> 15:15.187
that there was an article in the Worcester paper about something.

15:15.207 --> 15:16.028
You would never go there.

15:16.768 --> 15:20.872
And even if you went there, you'd have to go through a back file.

15:20.892 --> 15:21.753
That's right.

15:21.773 --> 15:22.794
You'd have to go through a back file.

15:22.814 --> 15:25.877
And nowadays on film, it's even harder to do that.

15:25.897 --> 15:28.339
So the collection is just invaluable.

15:28.579 --> 15:39.870
It chronicles a period when the fine press movement was just bursting with energy and was partly responsible for creating

15:40.441 --> 15:49.752
the mania for collecting books, because the printers, I think, were creating objects that people could get excited about.

15:49.792 --> 15:50.673
This is good stuff.

15:50.753 --> 15:52.535
Somebody's out here, let's look in.

15:53.576 --> 16:01.185
We're talking about the Wing now, who's the granddaddy of the Wing collection.

16:01.566 --> 16:02.607
He was an extra illustrator.

16:02.627 --> 16:03.848
Have you run across that phenomenon?

16:03.868 --> 16:04.069
No.

16:04.509 --> 16:09.435
In the 19th century, it was kind of a common collector's phenomenon to take Victorian books

16:10.327 --> 16:23.982
I mean, take contemporary books and split them apart and insert illustrations drawn from other sources, either other books or from collections of, in his case, lots of collections of older engravings.

16:24.983 --> 16:36.556
So he would take an Oscar Wilde play and illustrate it, extending it to sometimes 10, 15 volumes, you know, an article for a book that was only a very small book.

16:37.337 --> 16:40.300
And then he would have a title page privately printed

16:40.769 --> 16:48.318
for it, explaining what, you know, he was a publisher, and so that's why he was able to, you know, he had all these connections.

16:48.338 --> 16:51.623
He would have them printed that would describe what he had done to the book.

16:52.183 --> 17:01.074
And usually it describes himself as a joker or as a misanthrope or one or another of his characters that he played.

17:02.156 --> 17:06.321
And then often he would put this portrait in as the frontispiece

17:06.689 --> 17:07.590
facing them.

17:07.630 --> 17:11.135
I'll show you these books in the stacks tomorrow if you're going to be back tomorrow.

17:12.176 --> 17:13.258
They're absolutely hilarious.

17:13.358 --> 17:16.422
And then, in his latter years, he had an office here at the Newberry.

17:17.083 --> 17:25.795
The building was so big, and there were so few books in those days, that they just gave him a room where he could work on his own work.

17:25.875 --> 17:27.277
And he would have them rebound.

17:27.897 --> 17:30.901
He would then have these books bound up in the Newberry Bindery at the time.

17:32.984 --> 17:35.127
And

17:35.360 --> 17:47.801
So they exist now as a separate group of books that, again, are mentioned in the will, that they're only to be consulted in the presence of the Wing custodian, the custodian of the Wing Foundation.

17:48.743 --> 17:56.396
The reason for that being that they, because they're pasted together, they're a little bit, it's kind of a fragile sort of a little.

17:56.416 --> 17:58.279
Give me a read on Wing.

17:59.002 --> 18:00.565
The best word is eccentric.

18:00.625 --> 18:02.207
There's no other way of putting it.

18:02.628 --> 18:07.055
I keep a few of his artifacts of his life around the office here.

18:08.457 --> 18:10.841
He made his fortune as a commercial publisher.

18:12.904 --> 18:16.450
And, you know, Chicago was early on an important center for commercial publishing.

18:17.211 --> 18:22.680
And he did this kind of book, which is... It's basically...

18:22.981 --> 18:52.785
puff prose about Chicago, the tunnels and water system of Chicago, which was, yeah, which is, that's right, stamped, gilt stamped, cloth binding, which was one of the, it was in fact one of the engineering wonders of the world, along with the, yeah, the tunnels that go out under the lake to bring our fresh water in, and this pumping station, which is now a water tower, which is still a monument, it's one of the few things to survive the fire.

18:53.474 --> 19:00.243
This was built during the Civil War, and it was at the time one of the largest pieces of masonry work ever undertaken.

19:01.105 --> 19:03.047
And this is a kind of beat-up copy.

19:03.828 --> 19:11.940
There's a better copy in the collection, but it has all these copper plate and wood engraved illustrations about how the work was done.

19:12.420 --> 19:18.008
And then it has this fold-out plate that shows the way the system works with the city and the lake.

19:18.148 --> 19:19.971
That's way ahead of its time, isn't it?

19:20.052 --> 19:29.145
Well, as a piece of publishing, it's booster prose for the city, which is a great tradition in Chicago.

19:29.726 --> 19:31.509
Chicagoans love to brag.

19:32.069 --> 19:48.473
He also published books on the World's Fair in 1993, and he made his fortune, actually, as a publisher of trade magazines, his most important titles being one called The Landowner, which was for farmers, and one called...

19:48.824 --> 19:50.165
really for gentlemen farmers.

19:50.586 --> 19:51.487
One word, landowner?

19:51.547 --> 19:52.848
Landowner, no, it's two words.

19:54.150 --> 20:00.616
And the other one was called the Western Brewer, which was a trade magazine for brewmasters.

20:00.656 --> 20:04.721
And of course, in those days, every little town had its own brewery, so there was a built-in public.

20:04.741 --> 20:10.187
The Newberry has the only complete run of the Western Brewer to survive, and it was his own.

20:12.229 --> 20:16.333
He retired when he was 47 and spent the rest of his life

20:16.921 --> 20:19.825
collecting books and extra illustrating them.

20:20.205 --> 20:21.066
He was a bachelor.

20:21.126 --> 20:25.612
Didn't seem to have much use for any woman except his sister and his mother.

20:27.094 --> 20:29.918
Was very irreligious.

20:29.978 --> 20:33.943
He was deliberately... He baited people about the question of religion.

20:33.963 --> 20:35.345
It was one of the things he liked to do.

20:35.385 --> 20:40.752
And this is one of his... Which he had.

20:41.255 --> 20:46.702
wound up with the title Gallery of Religious Hypocrisy.

20:46.942 --> 20:48.645
And what it is is just his clippings.

20:49.065 --> 20:50.046
There are two volumes.

20:50.787 --> 20:54.652
It's his collection of Newsbreaker clippings about religious hoaxes.

20:55.694 --> 20:57.556
English War on the Jesuits.

21:00.080 --> 21:00.921
He put this together.

21:00.961 --> 21:03.023
Yeah, this is his scrapbook.

21:03.043 --> 21:04.425
There's a number of his scrapbooks here.

21:04.505 --> 21:05.326
I can show them to you.

21:05.346 --> 21:11.194
Ministers must believe in Adam according to the New York Presbytery.

21:11.849 --> 21:17.155
professor of theology, defends hazing at Yale.

21:18.256 --> 21:31.571
His whole thing is that anybody who's religious is automatically anti-progress and anti-modern, and a Christian scientist upheld court reverses conviction for failure to report diphtheria.

21:31.591 --> 21:35.595
Now, there's a contemporary issue.

21:35.980 --> 21:38.002
Church is cold to working there.

21:38.042 --> 21:40.704
I don't know if you follow the hazing stories, which are very current.

21:40.764 --> 21:46.249
I mean, kids have been really hurt and humiliated by some hazing.

21:47.290 --> 21:48.911
Here's one from the heartland where I was born.

21:48.951 --> 21:49.872
Hartford, Wisconsin.

21:49.932 --> 21:53.055
Holy Hill, Feast of the Assumption, celebrated by 2,000 pilgrims.

21:53.615 --> 21:54.596
Hartford, Wisconsin.

21:54.696 --> 21:55.977
That's where you're from?

21:56.017 --> 21:57.279
My family comes from there, yeah.

22:00.702 --> 22:04.705
So he was just collecting newspaper clips on

22:06.389 --> 22:08.492
religious nonsense, according to him.

22:11.515 --> 22:14.559
So this really was his monument, then, his legacy.

22:15.680 --> 22:32.080
Well, I think his original intention, I've got the papers here, you can look through them tomorrow, I think his original intention was to create an endowment for the Newbery to collect extra illustrated books.

22:33.542 --> 22:34.303
But the trustees

22:34.638 --> 22:42.710
talked him into a broader subject field, namely history of printing, on the grounds that he had made his fortune as a publisher.

22:43.051 --> 22:50.121
This is a very interesting example of the institutional education process.

22:50.141 --> 22:51.964
Sitting down and talking.

22:52.144 --> 22:53.566
It's a wonderful idea, sir.

22:54.167 --> 22:56.611
But we can do something even more wonderful.

22:56.751 --> 22:57.693
Yeah, exactly.

22:57.813 --> 22:59.656
And also, it's an educational function.

22:59.676 --> 23:03.902
I mean, here was a man who had the enthusiasm and he had the money.

23:04.186 --> 23:12.115
What he didn't have was a focus that was public-spirited in a way that would really be useful to the public of Chicago.

23:12.776 --> 23:15.819
It's not that he lacked the will or that he was stupid.

23:15.839 --> 23:23.287
It was just that he wasn't informed about what was best or most useful to the public, to the reading public.

23:24.349 --> 23:27.292
So they persuaded him into the notion of history of printing.

23:28.573 --> 23:32.758
And...

23:33.143 --> 23:38.208
Indeed, his only really lasting monument is the Wing Foundation and the spectacular collection.

23:39.048 --> 23:41.851
So he left his collection, which is a good collection, right?

23:42.071 --> 23:53.261
It's an interesting collection as an example of Victorian taste in the city, and particularly of the taste of a kind of eccentric bachelor gentleman.

23:54.082 --> 23:57.425
I would like to do an exhibit on him someday, just because he's such a Chicago type.

23:57.485 --> 24:01.969
You know, somebody who came here as a printer's apprentice and made a fortune,

24:02.168 --> 24:04.652
and acquired culture along the way on the frontier.

24:04.752 --> 24:05.814
You want a resident theme?

24:06.114 --> 24:06.835
Isaiah Thomas.

24:07.156 --> 24:08.117
That's right.

24:08.178 --> 24:08.618
Exactly.

24:09.720 --> 24:13.486
He's that kind of a figure, but transposed a century later.

24:14.848 --> 24:17.593
You see, the pieces are falling into place, aren't they, you know?

24:19.195 --> 24:22.981
And really what Isaiah did with the American Antiquarian Society is the same thing.

24:23.262 --> 24:25.125
That's a monument to the printing arts.

24:25.145 --> 24:25.425
Sure.

24:26.013 --> 24:26.674
Sure.

24:26.774 --> 24:28.475
And every possible crazy.

24:29.036 --> 24:30.337
Have you been there, though?

24:30.557 --> 24:31.418
No, I've never been.

24:31.438 --> 24:31.698
You're much.

24:31.718 --> 24:32.980
It's really quite wonderful.

24:33.080 --> 24:34.421
It really is crazy.

24:35.302 --> 24:37.544
It happens to be two minutes from where I work.

24:37.844 --> 24:39.626
That's nice.

24:41.588 --> 24:43.730
To recycle here a little bit, rewind.

24:45.031 --> 24:47.013
OK, so his collection is interesting.

24:47.133 --> 24:48.094
But he was a collector.

24:48.134 --> 24:50.276
But he is an example, one might say.

24:51.738 --> 24:54.180
He really wanted to create a monument.

24:55.223 --> 24:58.729
he left really the money and the mandate to do it.

24:58.769 --> 25:01.173
I didn't say it with much facility.

25:01.233 --> 25:02.194
No, I think that's accurate.

25:02.234 --> 25:03.496
That's exactly accurate.

25:03.917 --> 25:08.324
He left a legacy of enthusiasm and cash.

25:09.145 --> 25:17.379
And those are two things that, in the hands of the right, institutional people can be really developed.

25:17.819 --> 25:19.242
His own books are all still here.

25:19.923 --> 25:21.906
They've suffered different fates.

25:22.477 --> 25:33.730
The ones that were genuinely interesting and useful at the core of a couple thousand volumes were added, were inserted into the wing collection, given a wing classification.

25:35.092 --> 25:40.819
The ones that were decorative ended up being used as furniture books.

25:41.499 --> 25:43.942
There is this category in the mind of some people.

25:43.962 --> 25:47.326
You know, they have interesting bindings and they can line the walls of offices.

25:48.407 --> 25:50.610
And the others are...

25:51.350 --> 25:54.435
relegated to the basement where they still live.

25:54.535 --> 26:02.107
If they're in the new building, they're perfectly safe and comfortable, but they're mostly duplicates of books that are already or elsewhere in the collection.

26:03.649 --> 26:15.588
Because he was an extra illustrator, he had the habit of clipping the pictures out of books, and so a lot of his books are what we call, what bibliographers call cripples, and they're not very useful for research purposes on that account.

26:16.670 --> 26:18.893
He was a collector, really, who's

26:19.717 --> 26:29.030
He's different from me, because we really don't celebrate him so much for his own collection, but for what he contributed post-mortem.

26:29.050 --> 26:34.857
For what he enabled to be born, to be nourished.

26:34.897 --> 26:44.931
But is his spirit, let's ask this, does his spirit course through the collection as it's built, the mandate of

26:45.383 --> 26:52.131
Well, I think one way or another, it's hard to say whether anybody nowadays would find him an attractive character.

26:52.772 --> 27:03.025
I don't mean his spirit as an individual.

27:03.045 --> 27:08.472
I mean his spirit in terms of his legacy, his big quest.

27:08.637 --> 27:09.658
He did set the course.

27:10.019 --> 27:10.399
That's right.

27:10.580 --> 27:11.060
With help.

27:11.080 --> 27:11.521
That's right.

27:11.922 --> 27:13.764
And assistance and advice.

27:13.924 --> 27:14.225
Yeah.

27:14.345 --> 27:25.560
And I mean, the other thing that happens is that in the course of an institutional collection like this, it takes on a life of its own in terms of the personalities of the curators.

27:27.523 --> 27:32.670
It's been, what, 80 years, 70 years since the

27:33.173 --> 27:34.274
Wing Foundation was founded.

27:34.294 --> 27:37.558
There have been only four curators in one collection.

27:37.578 --> 27:38.099
I'm the fourth.

27:38.539 --> 27:39.260
So how long have you been?

27:39.280 --> 27:39.981
Only two years.

27:40.021 --> 27:42.304
So I haven't put my stamp on the collection yet.

27:42.364 --> 27:44.927
But the other three people are there.

27:45.568 --> 27:57.442
The other three people are people who never would have been collectors, probably, in their own right, because they didn't have the means of the education, but the institution made them collectors.

27:58.523 --> 28:00.666
And consequently, they

28:01.405 --> 28:05.230
their personalities became very important.

28:05.251 --> 28:08.335
The first curator was the most scholarly of them.

28:08.355 --> 28:23.116
That's Pierce Butler, who went on to be professor of library science at the University of Chicago and was a very important collector for the Newberry of Incunable's 15th century books.

28:24.819 --> 28:30.687
His vision for the collection was to create a

28:31.544 --> 28:46.301
a collection of 15th and 16th century books that would exemplify type design, specifically on the level of the letter itself, and exemplify the work of every significant printer of the 15th century.

28:46.942 --> 28:51.407
And by the end of the 20s, when he moved on to the University of Chicago, he had essentially done that.

28:51.427 --> 29:01.399
He bought 1,700 incunables for the Newberry, best period right after the First World War, to buy incunables, and had created a really rich

29:01.683 --> 29:27.943
exemplary collection for printing and printing design on the level of the letter and the page layout what the rest of us have done ever since is supplement that with a few things that we're still missing unavailable to him and then broaden it to reflect concerns of scholars and type designers since things like bindings things like user notes things like

29:28.835 --> 29:32.641
with black books, you know, slightly different technologies.

29:33.422 --> 29:44.778
And then, because of their interests, Jim Wells, my predecessor in Ernst Deterer, his, broadened it in the direction of illustration as well.

29:46.481 --> 29:50.286
Rich was, who was the second one?

29:50.306 --> 29:51.568
Ernst Deterer was the second.

29:51.868 --> 29:52.529
Say again?

29:52.549 --> 29:58.538
Ernst Deterer, D-E-T-T-E-R-E-R.

29:59.750 --> 30:01.352
Paul Wells was three.

30:01.492 --> 30:02.013
Jim Wells.

30:02.233 --> 30:05.218
Jim Wells.

30:05.298 --> 30:05.919
W-E-L-L-E-S, right?

30:06.179 --> 30:16.794
No, just S. Deterer's interest, because he was primarily an art teacher and a lettering teacher, was in calligraphy.

30:17.395 --> 30:29.031
And what he did was to broaden the definition of the collection history of printing to include the design aspects of the letterer as a handwritten thing, which he correctly saw

30:29.247 --> 30:37.875
At a time when I think a lot of people didn't, he correctly saw that at every generation, printers and type designers went back to handwritten forms.

30:37.915 --> 30:40.697
They didn't merely copy earlier printed forms.

30:40.757 --> 30:44.080
They went back to look for their inspiration in the handwritten letter.

30:44.781 --> 30:47.123
And this is true right up to the 20th century.

30:47.543 --> 30:53.709
The best designers of type in the 20th century have also been calligraphers, or at any rate, understood calligraphy.

30:54.690 --> 30:57.432
One of the...

30:58.238 --> 31:05.365
in coming to that realization, whereas practical printers had been doing it since the revival of the private press movement.

31:08.268 --> 31:16.536
But it was Dreader's genius to bring that perception, because he was a practical printer, into the library and to institutionalize it in terms of this collection.

31:18.137 --> 31:25.905
And then Jim Wells, again, I think was something of a clairvoyant.

31:25.925 --> 31:28.127
He was really ahead of his time in realizing that

31:28.512 --> 31:40.945
the most important undocumented aspect in the Wing Collection was what we now call the social history of printing, and what probably then would have been considered the social context of the printers.

31:41.766 --> 31:57.962
And he began collecting manuscript archives, little archives about printing by printers, a wonderful, for example, set of the statutes of the booksellers of Siena in the 16th century, that kind of thing.

31:58.347 --> 32:02.351
Lots of material on French printing at the time of the Revolution.

32:03.432 --> 32:14.481
Groups of ephemeral printing, which are not always in the Wing collection, but which were bought as blocks in the period of the 50s and 60s to give us some real depth in one kind of printing.

32:14.641 --> 32:18.605
A very famous collection of French revolutionary pamphlets falls into that collection.

32:19.085 --> 32:26.532
Another really important one is on the Jansenist Press, the French... Spelleth my type is J.

32:26.832 --> 32:28.914
S-E-N-I-S-T.

32:30.916 --> 32:43.127
This was a French hyper-Catholic movement in the 17th and 18th century, and they had their own press at Fort Royal and their own schools, and they were basically persecuted by the French Catholic Church.

32:45.570 --> 32:48.412
And so we have a very, very large collection of that.

32:48.472 --> 32:54.358
We also have a collection on English recusancy, which is English Catholicism in the 16th, 17th, and 18th century.

32:54.895 --> 33:00.460
R-E-C-U-S-A-N-C-Y, I think.

33:00.620 --> 33:07.586
Just give her a general idea so I can take it from there.

33:07.906 --> 33:16.554
So each curator tries to bring a personal stamp or give it a little personal stamp?

33:16.574 --> 33:21.058
I think more or less consciously, everyone has their own priorities and interests.

33:21.078 --> 33:23.620
Another one of Jim's interests was in Victorian printing.

33:24.005 --> 33:37.299
which, particularly for the period before William Morris and the revival of the private press movement, had been kind of ignored by the early 20th century historians of the press, who thought it was just bad taste, when in fact it was very interesting.

33:37.319 --> 33:43.305
I mean, this is the period of the revolution of the mechanization of printing, and so Jim collected very heavily in that area.

33:44.086 --> 33:44.967
I'm going to have to go to lunch.

33:45.027 --> 33:53.556
I have a new appointment, but what I want to know is, and then I have a meeting at 1.30, but I should come for you a little after 2.

33:53.806 --> 33:57.171
John Wing now with Paul.

33:57.571 --> 34:05.062
He took a great variety of things and customized the books, if you will, in a way that a lot of extra illustrators did.

34:05.402 --> 34:08.106
But his own vanity was such that he always appears on the title page.

34:08.226 --> 34:10.149
Sometimes he is the frontispiece to the book.

34:11.511 --> 34:12.773
As in this instance, for instance.

34:12.953 --> 34:13.434
That's right.

34:13.454 --> 34:14.795
And this is where he describes himself.

34:14.816 --> 34:15.897
This is what this book is again.

34:15.917 --> 34:17.159
This is The Decay of Living.

34:17.780 --> 34:19.883
The Decay of Lying by Oscar Wilde.

34:20.644 --> 34:23.728
And he's actually illustrated it to two folio volumes.

34:24.518 --> 34:31.789
And then he signs it, prints from the collection of the Old Corner Library, inlaid and adapted to the text by John M. Wing, A Doubting Thomas.

34:31.869 --> 34:34.312
Why do you suppose he called himself A Doubting Thomas?

34:34.473 --> 34:39.119
Well, it was part of this pose of skepticism about religion.

34:39.139 --> 34:40.261
We talked about that this morning.

34:40.281 --> 34:41.583
And here we say yours, John M. Wing.

34:41.723 --> 34:41.984
That's right.

34:42.304 --> 34:45.288
Signs it to himself, because these were books that belonged to him.

34:45.789 --> 34:47.111
He inscribed this to himself.

34:47.291 --> 34:47.912
In a sense.

34:48.033 --> 34:51.117
It's actually the portrait itself is inscribed and then reproduced.

34:51.839 --> 34:55.604
This is the coat of arms of the Wing family, which also appears on these book plates.

34:56.945 --> 34:57.986
Let's see if I can find one.

34:58.006 --> 35:04.554
Some of them have kind of even misanthropic title pages.

35:07.057 --> 35:07.698
Look at that.

35:07.718 --> 35:10.121
It must have been a lithograph you just passed.

35:10.141 --> 35:10.321
Yeah.

35:10.822 --> 35:11.923
This is not the first volume.

35:11.943 --> 35:15.287
I guess we're going to have the first one in order, too.

35:15.307 --> 35:17.129
Did he have these bound locally?

35:17.590 --> 35:19.332
They were bound in the Newberry Bindery, yeah.

35:19.392 --> 35:19.712
Really?

35:19.752 --> 35:20.293
Most of them.

35:20.543 --> 35:23.026
These are all stamps that we still have.

35:23.246 --> 35:26.050
There's his book plate, see?

35:26.631 --> 35:28.653
Another passion of his was genealogy.

35:30.836 --> 35:32.378
Well, there must be a title page in here somewhere.

35:32.398 --> 35:33.800
Where did he put it?

35:33.820 --> 35:34.781
He actually took a book.

35:36.143 --> 35:39.127
The content might have actually been irrelevant to him.

35:39.247 --> 35:40.869
I mean, do you think he read these books?

35:41.170 --> 35:41.570
Oh, sure.

35:41.630 --> 35:42.351
I think he read them.

35:42.371 --> 35:45.195
But I think the books were an excuse.

35:45.215 --> 35:48.559
The book becomes an excuse for his own version of it.

35:49.298 --> 35:51.520
Right, now here's one, this Life of Geoffrey Chaucer.

35:51.560 --> 35:56.484
This may be an early one because he didn't add his own title page to it.

35:56.945 --> 35:59.327
I've never noticed one like that.

35:59.347 --> 36:00.088
Wait a minute, here it is.

36:00.348 --> 36:01.129
There is one.

36:01.149 --> 36:02.029
I knew there had to be one.

36:02.110 --> 36:02.730
Oh, there you go.

36:03.291 --> 36:06.474
Life of Geoffrey Chaucer by William Godwin.

36:07.274 --> 36:18.124
And here he describes himself as John M. Wing, a pilgrim with deft knife and paste, in company of great renown, with rare delight quite to his taste, riding to Canterbury town,

36:18.408 --> 36:23.515
This is... It's fake Chaucer poetry.

36:23.535 --> 36:28.041
Illuminating the Chaucerian age with apt engravings laid in every page.

36:28.362 --> 36:29.483
Isn't he something?

36:31.866 --> 36:32.547
That's wonderful.

36:34.110 --> 36:35.091
And he only did one of these?

36:37.014 --> 36:38.956
Well, there's only one Chaucer.

36:38.976 --> 36:42.781
I mean, every time he did one of these books, they only did one for him?

36:43.222 --> 36:43.623
Oh, sure.

36:44.003 --> 36:47.588
Because the object is to make a unique book, which is no longer...

36:47.922 --> 36:49.304
Godwin's Life of Chaucer.

36:49.464 --> 36:54.450
It's John M. Wing's extra-illustrated copy of Godwin's Life of Chaucer.

36:54.630 --> 36:55.672
Did anybody else do this?

36:55.772 --> 36:56.112
Oh, yes.

36:56.172 --> 37:03.762
It was a fairly common hobby in the 19th century, and indeed there are still people who do it.

37:06.105 --> 37:16.798
For many years, librarians preferred not to talk about this sort of thing because it's bibliographically a nightmare, because what you're doing is taking something which has a publishing

37:17.217 --> 37:41.098
published logic and creating a unique monster kind of a book and which is really a self-indulgence more than anything else well it certainly has that aspect and yet in another way it's a reaction against remember this becomes really popular in the late 19th century it's a reaction against

37:41.332 --> 37:45.877
It's a reaction against the machine-made book, the math-made book.

37:45.897 --> 37:48.861
Which he does, which this man essentially is involved in.

37:49.181 --> 37:49.641
That's right.

37:49.662 --> 37:50.522
That's where he made his money.

37:50.583 --> 37:56.850
And yet at the same time, what he's saying is he can take these machine-made books and turn them back into craft items.

37:56.870 --> 37:58.852
Into works of art, perhaps.

37:59.693 --> 38:02.076
Or at any rate, a craftsman's work.

38:02.476 --> 38:09.364
It becomes something which, I mean, that Chaucer is certainly a claim to some kind of art or artisan shepherd.

38:10.002 --> 38:20.838
And the other way of reacting against that, I mean, this is part and parcel of something that we hold sacred in book collecting circles, which is the private press movement.

38:21.079 --> 38:27.308
There you try to create the book as a hand printed item.

38:27.869 --> 38:39.486
So you're continuing to use the machinery, but you're going back to 16th century technology and saying that this is in some way superior to the 19th century manufactured book.

38:40.310 --> 38:51.701
So, you know, and I think that socially, or at any rate, philosophically, they're very similar kind of books.

38:51.721 --> 38:53.183
Here's Street's Lady Hamilton.

38:53.603 --> 38:58.948
Instead of talking about Extended or Prince, he calls it Toilette by John M. Wade.

38:59.969 --> 39:01.531
He's saying, I've dressed this lady.

39:02.131 --> 39:03.092
I have dressed Lady Hamilton.

39:03.112 --> 39:06.356
He actually has his name on the spine, virtually, of all of them.

39:06.516 --> 39:06.756
Yep.

39:07.883 --> 39:09.786
Extended by John M. Wing.

39:10.266 --> 39:11.889
Decorated by John M. Wing.

39:12.169 --> 39:13.391
Prints by John M. Wing.

39:13.411 --> 39:15.534
I'm just doing this by J.W.

39:15.574 --> 39:15.754
Wing.

39:15.854 --> 39:17.897
Extended and pictorially adorned.

39:19.559 --> 39:21.442
And then adorned by.

39:21.482 --> 39:26.669
So he did a different illuminated and extended by John M. Wing.

39:26.689 --> 39:27.851
That's wonderful, really.

39:28.251 --> 39:34.280
Here's an example where in this Lady Hamilton, he actually had the initial printed and then hand-colored.

39:34.480 --> 39:35.021
It's gorgeous.

39:35.541 --> 39:36.743
Here's very nice.

39:36.942 --> 39:38.584
Here's one of his misogynist ones.

39:38.604 --> 39:41.867
We've got to be careful about showing these because you have to explain this phenomenon.

39:42.908 --> 39:45.690
John M. Wing, an admirer of beautiful women and horses.

39:46.952 --> 39:47.292
Period.

39:47.732 --> 39:50.335
One often breaks your heart, the other your bones.

39:51.576 --> 39:59.704
A pedigreed filly with capital F ran away with him in 1864, breaking an arm, then disemboweled herself, period.

40:00.264 --> 40:05.329
She was a handsome vixen with intelligent, dreamy eyes, transported nostrils,

40:05.731 --> 40:33.342
palpitating flanks the tail of a comet and the speed of the wind he has made this book in memory of the mayor chicago the old corner library 1907 emma lady hamilton mistress of lord nelson of trafalgar and it's a magazine article it comes out of putnam's magazine and he's turned it into a folio book and this one it looks like there are some other illuminated pages inside

40:35.870 --> 40:39.936
Well, I guess there's a second volume.

40:41.918 --> 40:48.407
It actually looks like the title page to this book, Old Q. How many did he do these often?

40:50.470 --> 40:53.414
A couple of a year, or was he doing them constantly?

40:53.514 --> 40:54.796
You're looking at the collection.

40:54.816 --> 41:00.544
I think there are, what, 200 volumes here, all told, although there are not 200 titles.

41:00.676 --> 41:04.460
And these were all done in a period of about 20 years, 15, 20 years.

41:04.600 --> 41:06.202
So we're talking about 8 or 10 a year.

41:06.442 --> 41:06.902
One a month.

41:06.923 --> 41:09.705
I was going to Xerox this week.

41:09.725 --> 41:10.666
Yeah, that would be nice.

41:11.948 --> 41:12.328
They're great.

41:12.869 --> 41:14.550
So anyway, that's the ex-realistic books.

41:14.570 --> 41:15.732
Then this is the Incunables.

41:15.752 --> 41:17.934
These are all 15th century books.

41:18.354 --> 41:22.138
And this was primarily the legacy of Pierce Butler, you remember?

41:22.259 --> 41:23.320
We talked about Pierce Butler.

41:24.361 --> 41:27.544
And everywhere where you see a...

41:27.946 --> 41:33.394
a box, it usually means that there's a binding that's worth preserving as an object.

41:33.755 --> 41:36.779
In this case, a 15th century scholar's binding.

41:36.799 --> 41:40.405
It's wrapped in a soft vellum.

41:40.926 --> 41:47.075
It's the cheapest kind of binding of the period, and all the rarer for that in some ways.

41:47.916 --> 41:51.201
Otherwise, it may have a 19th century collection.

41:51.241 --> 41:55.067
Well, this is another early leather binding, probably 16th century.

41:55.621 --> 41:59.204
But it may also have a 19th or 20th century collector's binding of some sort.

42:02.788 --> 42:03.549
It's early again.

42:04.349 --> 42:18.203
One of the pleasures of the collection is because they were collected largely in the 19th century or from collectors right after the Second World War, yeah, right after the First World War, rather, because of that, often they've never been rebound.

42:18.263 --> 42:24.649
They have early or original bindings or a field of wormhole on their hands.

42:24.865 --> 42:33.874
You have fun up here, I'll bet.

42:34.295 --> 42:34.936
You enjoy this.

42:35.536 --> 42:41.823
Well, in fact, I'm writing an article right now which concerns this man right here.

42:41.863 --> 42:44.305
These are arranged by printer.

42:45.146 --> 42:53.455
So all the works of one printer, in this case, Antonio Miscomini, who was a printer at Florence in the 1480s and 90s,

42:53.806 --> 42:58.633
I'm doing an article on him, and all of his books that we own are right here, because this is the way they wrote.

42:58.653 --> 42:59.835
That's about 15 books, I'd say.

42:59.855 --> 43:00.576
Miscomini?

43:00.776 --> 43:02.298
Miscomini, yeah.

43:02.339 --> 43:04.161
M-I-S, C-O-M-I-N-I.

43:05.824 --> 43:06.384
Antonio.

43:07.146 --> 43:12.033
Okay, the rest of the collection, then, is arranged chronologically.

43:12.153 --> 43:15.818
Let's just lay this here so I don't forget that.

43:15.838 --> 43:18.362
Starting with 15th century books, there's some material on

43:18.882 --> 43:27.454
I noticed there are no sprinklers, but what do we, thank God, but do you have CO2 or something in here?

43:27.534 --> 43:28.315
Only in the vault.

43:28.376 --> 43:31.180
We have Halon in the vault.

43:31.200 --> 43:31.340
Halon.

43:31.640 --> 43:37.068
But this part of the building has a very sophisticated smoke alarm system.

43:37.148 --> 43:40.012
The notion is that we should get to it with a fire extinguisher first.

43:40.032 --> 43:42.055
That's what we're doing in the new building, by the way.

43:42.254 --> 43:46.400
Yeah, we decided that we didn't want to risk putting Halon in the whole building.

43:46.941 --> 43:47.802
Have you been to the Beinecke?

43:47.842 --> 43:51.448
The Beinecke is kind of scary.

43:51.468 --> 43:52.950
Yeah, when you kill people.

43:52.970 --> 43:59.760
Anyway, the 16th century books are arranged just like the 15th century ones, chronologically then by country, and then by printer.

43:59.780 --> 44:05.408
So all the works of a printer beginning with R, in this case, are together, and then there's an S printer, and so forth.

44:06.269 --> 44:12.058
As you go across the shelf, you see a lot of copies of Terence, because the decision was made early on

44:12.359 --> 44:22.950
that we would try and collect every edition of Terence, Terence being a Roman dramatic writer who was used as a school book in the Renaissance.

44:22.970 --> 44:38.367
So from the invention of printing forward, it was very commonly reprinted, both in these big scholarly editions like this that are primarily for university-level scholars or for performers, because it was also used on the stage.

44:38.718 --> 44:40.520
in little school books.

44:40.840 --> 44:42.782
It's T-E-R-E-N-C-E in it.

44:43.083 --> 44:45.705
Of all of those, the Roman comedian, Terence.

44:48.068 --> 44:51.672
And often they have more commentary than text.

44:52.893 --> 44:54.635
So there are all kinds of layout problems.

44:54.675 --> 44:55.636
They have illustrations.

44:55.656 --> 44:56.216
How old is this?

44:57.257 --> 44:58.939
This is a 16th century one.

44:58.979 --> 45:05.586
So the commentary actually was... I'm surprised to see commentary laid in with the...

45:05.785 --> 45:11.651
Well, because it was such an intensive subject of study, it got these incredibly complicated commentaries.

45:11.671 --> 45:13.332
Look, it's all commentary, no type.

45:13.733 --> 45:15.114
There's a little bit of text.

45:15.234 --> 45:28.026
And you see, it's a particularly interesting printing problem because different sizes of type for different purposes, and the layout has to be considered on every page.

45:29.788 --> 45:32.210
There's all commentary, no text.

45:32.230 --> 45:33.151
Now, have you treated this?

45:33.191 --> 45:33.852
You must...

45:34.000 --> 45:36.883
No, this is pretty much in its original state.

45:37.084 --> 45:37.965
This one came.

45:37.985 --> 45:39.927
$45 somebody paid.

45:40.367 --> 45:40.548
No?

45:40.868 --> 45:41.549
That's what it says.

45:43.311 --> 45:46.194
I think we're going to fetch a little more than that in the market today, don't you think?

45:47.335 --> 45:50.259
Yeah, this was bought by us in 1951.

45:52.662 --> 45:57.007
And the binding is a 20th century collector's binding.

45:57.027 --> 46:00.150
But that $45 price is probably earlier than 1951.

46:00.270 --> 46:02.573
It has to be.

46:03.329 --> 46:05.733
Although, 51 is well before the great inflation.

46:07.816 --> 46:10.920
Did you have any run-ins with Mr. Blumberg out here?

46:12.883 --> 46:13.804
No, who is he?

46:13.824 --> 46:16.068
He's the fellow that they arrested in Iowa.

46:16.288 --> 46:17.730
Oh, right, yeah.

46:18.111 --> 46:20.374
No, we worried about that one.

46:20.414 --> 46:23.599
As far as we can tell, we never saw him.

46:24.260 --> 46:27.264
Here's one in a 16th century.

46:27.284 --> 46:30.689
That's the kind of thing that made me think of it as a book plate.

46:30.729 --> 46:32.712
He also collected book plates.

46:33.350 --> 46:35.033
Carved the vault like little trophies.

46:35.734 --> 46:38.859
This is the Wing Collection book plate, not Wing Zone book plate.

46:38.879 --> 46:42.986
Instead of it, but he would have added that to his collection.

46:43.006 --> 46:49.036
And you see this is a Terence with an illustrated frontispiece and a big index.

46:49.096 --> 46:50.658
Do you have any Caxton's?

46:51.419 --> 46:51.720
Oh, yeah.

46:52.561 --> 46:53.323
Will you show me one?

46:53.343 --> 46:53.543
Sure.

46:53.563 --> 46:54.324
They're in the vault.

46:54.344 --> 46:55.125
We'll have to go in the vault.

46:55.166 --> 46:56.708
Oh, that would be nice.

46:57.886 --> 46:59.608
I promise I'll be a good boy.

47:00.610 --> 47:07.379
Caxons are so much rarer than most other incunables that we all fall into that category.

47:07.419 --> 47:09.162
Well, every Caxon.

47:09.182 --> 47:09.322
Yeah.

47:09.342 --> 47:10.444
How many did Pepys have?

47:10.584 --> 47:12.206
About 16 or actually?

47:12.246 --> 47:12.547
Wow.

47:13.007 --> 47:18.275
Yeah, of course, his incunable, his English incunable collection is really unmatched.

47:18.295 --> 47:19.336
It's magnificent.

47:19.356 --> 47:19.556
Yeah.

47:20.598 --> 47:21.259
That was nice.

47:21.399 --> 47:25.024
Sit at the table, and I'll bring you some things.

47:25.044 --> 47:25.224
A lot.

47:25.365 --> 47:27.167
I'd love to let you walk around this time.

47:28.328 --> 47:28.989
Okay.

47:29.229 --> 47:32.352
I will sit right here.

47:33.253 --> 47:35.915
This is the rare book vault.

47:35.975 --> 47:38.257
This is the rare book vault.

47:46.125 --> 47:47.926
Signing the page in the rare book vault.

47:53.331 --> 47:57.255
There it is.

47:57.488 --> 47:58.729
Let's say these six.

47:59.210 --> 48:04.434
This is Bob Carroll, who is the head of the rare bookstore department.

48:04.454 --> 48:06.376
Nick is writing a book on book collectors.

48:08.077 --> 48:08.618
Oh.

48:08.678 --> 48:14.623
I'm suggesting to him that we've collected collectors as much as we can.

48:14.883 --> 48:16.865
American, worldwide?

48:18.186 --> 48:21.569
British and American, and historical.

48:23.011 --> 48:25.673
A lot of our incunables, a lot of our

48:26.564 --> 48:29.989
rare for seditions of all sorts, come from the Louis Silver collection.

48:30.009 --> 48:31.150
It was H. Silver.

48:31.471 --> 48:31.891
That's right.

48:32.012 --> 48:33.654
And he was a trustee of the Newberry.

48:34.896 --> 48:35.797
Bob, do you know what he did?

48:35.837 --> 48:38.941
Ask him when he comes back.

48:40.183 --> 48:55.845
A Chicago businessman and a trustee of the Newberry, who intended his collection to come to the Newberry and was buying, you know, sure, help yourself, at him, who was, who was... I'm sorry, I really don't want to fool him, you know.

48:56.888 --> 48:57.649
Oh, my.

48:58.270 --> 48:59.611
This is the Christine de Pizan.

48:59.772 --> 49:01.053
Yeah.

49:01.714 --> 49:03.757
He intended his collection to come to the library.

49:03.797 --> 49:04.818
What did Louis Silver do?

49:05.359 --> 49:07.341
He owned a chain of hotels.

49:08.022 --> 49:10.365
Oh, okay.

49:10.385 --> 49:17.474
And my understanding is he expected his collection to come to the library, but in the latter part of his life, he had sort of financial embarrassments.

49:17.654 --> 49:20.618
He was a trustee of the Newberry, too, for quite a while, I guess.

49:20.638 --> 49:23.622
And I think...

49:25.103 --> 49:26.986
I'm not sure that it wasn't his relic.

49:27.166 --> 49:30.130
Well, his will, he obviously didn't leave it to us as well.

49:30.350 --> 49:36.278
But I think maybe it was his heirs who made this thing to sell it to Texas.

49:36.298 --> 49:38.061
Well, it was to be sold to Texas.

49:38.081 --> 49:38.421
That was?

49:38.782 --> 49:40.724
Yeah, the whole of the silver collection.

49:40.744 --> 49:40.905
Really?

49:40.925 --> 49:42.327
I was going to go to the collection.

49:42.347 --> 49:44.149
This is one of our big coups.

49:44.249 --> 49:45.671
Well, tell me a little bit about this.

49:46.673 --> 49:47.674
That's 1490, by the way.

49:47.694 --> 49:50.478
The person at Pizan.

49:50.498 --> 49:50.638
Yeah.

49:51.040 --> 50:01.512
Apparently the word was that the University of Texas had made an offer for this collection and it had been accepted and they considered it a done deal.

50:01.712 --> 50:02.253
Texas did.

50:02.273 --> 50:02.853
Texas did.

50:02.994 --> 50:13.926
But apparently we got wind of it here and did a little behind the scenes investigation and found out that they hadn't really signed anything.

50:14.125 --> 50:20.113
And Bill Towner, who was then a brand-new president here, was it in, what, 62 or something?

50:20.133 --> 50:20.674
Something like that?

50:20.714 --> 50:27.082
Right at the beginning of Harry Ransom's... Well, and it was the beginning of Bill Towner's time, too.

50:27.102 --> 50:28.103
Bill came in 62.

50:28.624 --> 50:32.209
And this was seen as being, you know, could be a chance to really do something great.

50:32.229 --> 50:42.342
So I guess he got the trustees together, and they agreed to do something they had never done before, which was draw on capital to the tune of... Two million dollars.

50:42.362 --> 50:43.103
Two million dollars.

50:43.690 --> 50:48.995
And they just, and figured, well, we'll make it up, we'll borrow it, and we'll sell duplicates.

50:49.015 --> 50:50.697
We'll generate a lot of duplicates.

50:50.977 --> 50:52.960
$2 million in 1962?

50:53.040 --> 50:53.600
I think it was.

50:53.820 --> 51:01.548
And the decision was to do that, and then to, he also at the same time got them to agree to a new capital campaign.

51:01.588 --> 51:06.133
It was the first time that Newberry had ever gone out to raise money in a public way.

51:06.894 --> 51:08.095
So the acquisition...

51:08.480 --> 51:16.811
was a kickoff for the First Capital Campaign, which, in a sense, moved the Newberry into the 20th century, 62 years into the 20th century.

51:17.472 --> 51:30.589
But because we had always simply existed on our endowment until that period, essentially, and it had been enlarged by trustees and other people who were associated with the library,

51:30.940 --> 51:36.830
but we had never done a public fundraising before, and they used the collection and an exhibit around the collection.

51:36.931 --> 51:37.692
The silver collection.

51:37.712 --> 51:38.453
The silver collection.

51:38.473 --> 51:40.517
So I've got to be able to find some things on this.

51:40.938 --> 51:42.480
Yeah, I can find some stuff on it.

51:42.500 --> 51:44.344
We've got a pile of clippings on it.

51:44.404 --> 51:45.305
I'd love to see it.

51:45.566 --> 51:54.822
I'm doing a chapter on Texas, and these are the kinds of stories that... The librarians love to tell the one that got away collection.

51:54.802 --> 51:56.224
story if they got it.

51:56.605 --> 51:57.646
Let me ask you a question.

51:57.666 --> 52:06.699
Did they match Texas's price or did they be a... I'm not sure that it wasn't less, but it was cash or something.

52:06.719 --> 52:12.227
Well, and the heirs were glad, I think, of the consideration of keeping it in the center since it had been here.

52:12.308 --> 52:16.333
So Silver was a major collector of incunables, as I said.

52:16.494 --> 52:19.819
English and American first editions, I think is the way it was, isn't it?

52:19.839 --> 52:21.080
Or was it English first editions?

52:21.100 --> 52:24.285
Well, the Speculum was a silver book.

52:24.400 --> 52:25.441
That's right.

52:25.461 --> 52:31.309
He had beautiful manuscripts, he had a lot of English first editions.

52:33.012 --> 52:37.197
I don't know if there was much modern literature.

52:37.477 --> 52:49.834
As a matter of fact, there's a little sketch of silver in that book I was telling you about, if it's the book you're thinking of, and I remember reading that and this person was quite

52:50.472 --> 53:14.725
quite uh down on the newberry for having done this this was considered not quite not quite kosher or something this book on collecting yeah what book i'm collecting was this i'll see if i can dig it out but it's just one that i think it's called american book club okay i'll check that yeah america but he's got a sketch on on silver and he talks about how the newberry kind of stole that's that's that's don dixon's book um

53:14.992 --> 53:28.275
But we did go through our collection and find a number of duplicates, and there was a great big sale at Sotheby's, which I think must have been the first of the big library duplicate sales.

53:28.762 --> 53:34.408
Well, the one that is typically said to have started the stampede in book prices.

53:34.709 --> 53:35.450
That sale was?

53:35.610 --> 53:37.892
Yeah, that was a Sotheby's sale.

53:37.913 --> 53:39.534
The silver sale at Sotheby's in 1964.

53:39.554 --> 53:41.737
It was important enough that they made a film of it.

53:41.757 --> 53:44.060
Sotheby's made a film of it, which we have, actually.

53:44.100 --> 53:45.161
People might even enjoy seeing it.

53:45.621 --> 53:47.043
It's a screamingly funny film.

53:47.063 --> 53:51.428
Of course, it's funnier to us that know these guys as old men, to see them all.

53:51.408 --> 53:53.792
It's a film of what?

53:53.972 --> 53:54.753
Of the sale.

53:54.813 --> 53:56.776
It's the auctioneer calling off the lot.

53:56.796 --> 53:58.459
And there's a narration and they talk about it.

53:58.479 --> 54:02.165
Because it did bring a lot of really important books into the auction room.

54:02.185 --> 54:04.488
They hadn't been there, some of them, for a long, long time.

54:04.548 --> 54:05.710
It was a blockbuster sale.

54:06.151 --> 54:08.875
In fact, I've got a copy of that catalog.

54:08.955 --> 54:12.821
You know, I've got that big pile of spiral bomb copies.

54:12.961 --> 54:14.584
I'm having fun.

54:14.624 --> 54:16.347
This is what I came for.

54:16.367 --> 54:19.071
I can tell what you're really interested in is library gossip.

54:19.091 --> 54:19.812
Well, yeah, but...

54:20.045 --> 54:22.708
But that's, no, that's the stuff that the book is made of.

54:22.748 --> 54:26.592
In fact, it's what collectors do very well.

54:26.672 --> 54:29.495
There's, you know, gossip about collecting and other collectors.

54:29.835 --> 54:30.596
I've had so much fun.

54:32.098 --> 54:35.141
I wish I could document 90% of the stories I've heard.

54:35.161 --> 54:38.184
That's right, because in fact a lot of them are apocryphal.

54:42.048 --> 54:48.735
But anyways, the silver sale I think in many ways was even more important than the silver collection because it...

54:49.643 --> 55:03.938
It was presented by Sotheby's as a very public-spirited thing of the New Age to do to let the trade have its duplicates, you know, duplicates generated by the purchase of the collection.

55:04.078 --> 55:06.701
Of course, there is a precedent that Huntington did that, too.

55:06.921 --> 55:09.524
You know, he would buy libraries on block.

55:09.584 --> 55:10.905
He was going like crazy.

55:10.946 --> 55:17.893
I've got a stack of catalogs this high, which are deaccessioned Huntington Library books.

55:17.913 --> 55:18.013
Yeah.

55:18.348 --> 55:18.949
Oh, sure.

55:18.989 --> 55:19.750
Look, it's from the honey.

55:19.770 --> 55:20.631
And he kept the best.

55:21.112 --> 55:22.734
They sold up.

55:22.754 --> 55:23.215
Oh, wow.

55:23.315 --> 55:24.036
Two-day sale.

55:24.677 --> 55:26.079
That's the selfie catalog?

55:26.099 --> 55:32.347
This is a copy that we made for... I think Bill Connor actually made these for a talk.

55:32.367 --> 55:33.068
He gave one to him.

55:33.088 --> 55:34.390
This is a copy of the catalog?

55:34.450 --> 55:34.711
Yeah.

55:34.891 --> 55:36.012
Are there any of these around here?

55:36.132 --> 55:37.014
Oh, I've got a stack of them.

55:37.034 --> 55:37.615
I can have this?

55:37.635 --> 55:40.298
Sure, absolutely.

55:40.358 --> 55:42.161
This man has become a collector.

55:42.882 --> 55:44.524
Why collect these, you know?

55:44.723 --> 55:46.905
But, I mean, there were some books that we didn't have.

55:47.005 --> 55:49.268
I mean, books that, like, for instance, this one.

55:49.948 --> 55:50.789
This is great.

55:50.809 --> 55:53.892
Does it have an introduction, by the way, to tell us a little bit of stuff?

55:54.833 --> 55:55.394
Yeah, I mean, it does.

55:55.434 --> 55:56.335
Yeah, it's got a preface.

55:56.415 --> 55:56.935
Oh, sure.

55:56.955 --> 55:57.636
There you go.

55:58.517 --> 55:59.498
And we've got some emos.

55:59.518 --> 56:00.559
The official story, though.

56:00.579 --> 56:01.600
Yeah, we've got some other emos.

56:01.620 --> 56:02.501
Oh, the official story.

56:02.561 --> 56:05.704
I mean, are you familiar with the garden sale in Haven O'Boer?

56:05.904 --> 56:07.126
That's a chapter in my book.

56:07.226 --> 56:10.349
I mean, if you believe self of these, it's just... Oh, this recent sale.

56:10.729 --> 56:13.532
There are two collectors that disagreed and went their separate ways.

56:13.883 --> 56:25.976
I thought that was one of those collections that had been put together within the last decade or so, just as a speculative thing.

56:26.196 --> 56:26.977
No, no.

56:27.697 --> 56:31.521
Not true.

56:32.723 --> 56:39.350
Well, that was also true of Walter Newberry, that at the end of his life he thought he was very poor.

56:39.650 --> 56:40.010
What was that?

56:40.030 --> 56:42.573
He was a multi-millionaire and thought he was poor.

56:42.593 --> 56:43.654
But it was dementia.

56:43.988 --> 56:47.592
Is this before he cut the will or afterwards, I wonder?

56:47.612 --> 56:48.873
Oh, it was well after.

56:48.893 --> 56:52.477
This was the very end of his... Well, he really had no idea this was going to come to pass.

56:52.557 --> 56:55.661
I mean, he had every hope and expectation that he would have grandchildren.

56:55.741 --> 57:00.366
It would have been a long shot, really, that the State Library... I mean, it's just all the numbers came up right for you guys.

57:01.287 --> 57:04.270
Not necessarily for the doctors.

57:04.290 --> 57:09.075
Yeah, anything on Silver and Probosco would be just great.

57:09.856 --> 57:12.218
Okay, I think I know where the Probosco file is.

57:12.278 --> 57:13.860
That's in the archives.

57:14.178 --> 57:22.227
In fact, I think that it might be good to just scan the whole of the Poole papers.

57:22.307 --> 57:33.900
It's not a very large thing, but William Frederick Poole was the person who set us off on this task of collecting on block collections that had been formed by other collectors.

57:33.920 --> 57:34.501
That's very important.

57:34.601 --> 57:42.430
And the two most important were the Probasco collection and then the Pio Resse collection, R-E-S-S-E, who was a

57:43.372 --> 57:46.536
Italian noblemen of some sort who had an early music collection.

57:47.097 --> 58:00.853
And it's the origin of our important Italian, our important holdings of early music, which are usually ranked first or second in the country for early music theory, particularly.

58:01.054 --> 58:02.215
If you're second, who's first?

58:02.596 --> 58:10.706
Well, the competition is between us and the Eastman School in Rochester, which is a very, very important collection.

58:10.766 --> 58:11.807
Isn't that interesting?

58:11.827 --> 58:11.927
Yeah.

58:13.291 --> 58:19.799
And I don't know whether that came from Eastman or not, but the Eastman School collection, I've seen it, it's wonderful.

58:20.640 --> 58:23.964
It's great for music printing as well.

58:24.264 --> 58:27.708
Did you know the names of anybody in Syracuse, by the way?

58:27.748 --> 58:32.834
No, I don't know anybody who still is there.

58:33.155 --> 58:35.918
Does that ring a bell with you at Syracuse?

58:36.559 --> 58:37.480
Has David gone there?

58:37.820 --> 58:40.143
Yeah, David Stanton is the librarian who used to be here.

58:40.183 --> 58:41.745
He used to be an associate librarian here.

58:42.535 --> 58:45.499
I always get Syracuse and Rochester confused, but it's Syracuse.

58:46.280 --> 58:51.447
Was that kind of the talk that Syracuse went a little wild?

58:51.467 --> 59:10.513
Yeah, that's what I heard, was that they had overbought, and then at some point, you know, the university isn't a really rich university, and they discovered that they were building buildings and trying to catalog, and ran out of money, and the university decided to put the brakes on it, on the ambition of the man who was building.

59:10.533 --> 59:12.255
But I don't know who it was.

59:12.893 --> 59:24.629
The Syracuse collection is interesting in any case, because already at the same time that we were buying Probasco and Pio Rese and Bonaparte, which are our big 19th century acquisitions.

59:24.649 --> 59:26.631
And this is the coalition's big brother, you would say.

59:26.651 --> 59:27.292
That's right.

59:27.733 --> 59:34.682
At the same time we were buying that, they were in the market and bought the collection of Leopold von Ranke.

59:35.337 --> 59:38.321
who was the greatest of the... You mean in the 1890s?

59:38.341 --> 59:38.522
Yes.

59:38.822 --> 59:40.104
Syracuse bought the von Raunke?

59:40.144 --> 59:41.406
About the von Raunke collection.

59:41.466 --> 59:44.891
He was the greatest of the German historians of the 19th century.

59:45.472 --> 59:51.701
And he wanted his collection to go to the Prussian State Library in Berlin, which said, oh, no, we have all that stuff.

59:52.482 --> 59:54.324
And so they sent it.

59:54.344 --> 59:57.950
They put it on the... His heir said, well, damn it, then no German library is going to have it.

59:57.970 --> 59:58.951
They put it on the market.

59:59.672 --> 01:00:01.795
And it was bought by Syracuse.

01:00:02.016 --> 01:00:04.399
And the catalog was finally done...

01:00:05.122 --> 01:00:08.307

01:00:08.347 --> 01:00:13.715
Sid Hutner was from the University of Chicago, or had been at the University of Chicago.

01:00:13.735 --> 01:00:19.724

Yeah, you should be able to get that.

01:00:22.968 --> 01:00:27.235
They have a number of publications on their collections.

01:00:27.535 --> 01:00:33.304

01:00:33.324 --> 01:00:34.926
You know, what people have to say about...
