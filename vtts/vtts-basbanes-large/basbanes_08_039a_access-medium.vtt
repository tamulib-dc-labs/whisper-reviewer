00:03.187 --> 00:07.013
That's a hope for the future, really.

00:07.514 --> 00:09.537
That's probably a perfect place to start.

00:09.577 --> 00:13.724
Because you're observing your 90th year.

00:14.665 --> 00:20.315
Your first book of volume of poetry was published 65 years ago.

00:20.835 --> 00:22.959
That's right.

00:23.059 --> 00:24.361
It amazes even me.

00:25.583 --> 00:29.329
So you really have not only lived through

00:31.047 --> 00:41.662
virtually the entire century, I mean, with the exception of the first five years, but you've written poetry through seven decades, I guess it is, 65 years.

00:42.283 --> 00:46.950
Here we are approaching the end of not only the century, but the millennium.

00:47.891 --> 00:48.652
What do you think?

00:48.692 --> 00:53.058
What do you see for poetry as we approach the next millennium?

00:54.040 --> 00:57.765
So many people feel that poetry really isn't relevant anymore.

00:57.865 --> 01:00.649
We don't agree, but address yourself to that.

01:02.772 --> 01:08.481
You cannot talk about poetry without talking about the state of our culture.

01:10.203 --> 01:29.252
And there's a curious hostility in certain quarters to...

01:31.595 --> 01:57.163
literature which is identified with liberalism and the whole tradition of individual pride and achievement as opposed to

01:58.780 --> 02:22.189
and opinion as opposed to the uniformity of a culture that the modern state has more or less made as a condition of our existence.

02:23.401 --> 02:24.942
I don't know whether I've said that.

02:25.263 --> 02:26.584
It's fine.

02:26.604 --> 02:27.985
I'm just looking at my notes.

02:28.106 --> 02:32.750
You can modify and put them to English.

02:34.191 --> 02:45.282
I guess it does concern me with what is... I guess I'm driving it, and I hate to offer such a question, but the relevance of the poet.

02:45.682 --> 02:49.306
You have not lost any faith in the relevance of poetry.

02:49.386 --> 02:50.387
How can I...

02:50.789 --> 02:59.657
lose faith in the noblest exercise of the human imagination, the human spirit.

03:01.679 --> 03:20.357
If civilization is to survive at all as a continuity of the great peaks of human understanding, love and

03:20.894 --> 03:35.444
achievement, then poetry must always be honored and read as well as written.

03:35.464 --> 03:39.553
We know there will always be somebody to write poetry.

03:39.573 --> 03:40.394
It's another question.

03:40.415 --> 03:41.637
Who is going to read it?

03:42.275 --> 03:57.680
I saw your Bill Moyers interview, and I read it back, and I interviewed Bill Moyers out in Chicago at the ABA, and that was such a wonderful... It's so gratifying to see this resurgence of poetry, isn't it?

03:57.720 --> 03:58.842
That's so grateful.

03:59.163 --> 04:07.877
Now we're coming to something that I think is very important, and which the academics, of course, deplore.

04:08.515 --> 04:12.360
They deplore this?

04:12.400 --> 04:14.783
Deplore, yes.

04:15.243 --> 04:28.280
Well, what offends the academicians is that poetry is welling up on the fringes of our society.

04:30.823 --> 04:37.071
It is no longer the sole property of the academy.

04:37.203 --> 04:42.909
There it is in little cafes, in bars.

04:43.869 --> 04:55.641
It is a testimony to the hunger of other people for the spoken word.

04:55.681 --> 05:03.929
The spoken word, but which is also... Is poetry fundamentally, do you believe, meant to be read aloud?

05:05.210 --> 05:07.092
It's the best poetry...

05:07.595 --> 05:18.626
root, that is its absolute central sustenance, is the voice itself.

05:18.646 --> 05:20.808
And it cannot be separated from it.

05:20.828 --> 05:26.393
And so when you are creating poetry, do you speak it aloud?

05:27.094 --> 05:29.016
That's the way I write my poems.

05:29.036 --> 05:31.678
I don't write them, I speak them.

05:31.778 --> 05:33.400
And they take shape first?

05:33.802 --> 05:37.648
They take shape as a sound, as much as anything else.

05:37.668 --> 05:40.111
So you're writing for the ear more than the eye.

05:40.472 --> 05:41.834
Always.

05:42.054 --> 05:43.376
That's the case.

05:43.757 --> 05:49.785
And I think that's one of the problems with poetry.

05:49.906 --> 05:54.032
It began with Gutenberg.

05:55.514 --> 06:00.501
The printed page became the repository of the words.

06:02.287 --> 06:06.233
There are blessings and curses to that, I guess, is what you're saying.

06:06.253 --> 06:14.146
Yes, of course it was a great thing, and thank God for it, Mr. Gutenberg.

06:14.927 --> 06:25.324
But the page then became the locale of poetry.

06:25.344 --> 06:29.931
You've actually called it the cold bed, I think, as a metaphor you use.

06:30.265 --> 06:55.750
And eventually, with the second I call retreat into the academy, the separation of poetry from the general population has become critical and grievous.

06:56.860 --> 06:59.483
Of course, Shakespeare didn't go to university either.

06:59.563 --> 07:00.404
No, no.

07:01.306 --> 07:06.872
Even his good friend Ben Johnson said, well, a little Latin and less Greek or whatever.

07:07.173 --> 07:08.114
They made fun of him.

07:08.194 --> 07:12.800
And they tried to deny him the right to creation.

07:12.820 --> 07:13.140
That's right.

07:13.160 --> 07:17.646
Because how could anyone so brilliant have not gone to university here?

07:17.806 --> 07:19.328
But it's really absurd.

07:19.348 --> 07:26.597
How do you feel about this, where music is played at these poetry performances, where there's a juxtaposition?

07:26.932 --> 07:36.083
I'm rather resistant to it because I feel that poetry has its own music.

07:36.103 --> 07:41.850
It's a very subtle, wonderfully variable, and profound.

07:42.210 --> 07:48.297
And it doesn't require any specification from without.

07:49.078 --> 07:53.023
So you certainly wouldn't think of poetry as lyrics.

07:53.358 --> 07:57.162
which is what it would be, I suppose, to music.

07:57.242 --> 07:59.905
A libretto, so to speak.

08:01.386 --> 08:05.450
The human voice is an instrument, then, when it comes to poetry.

08:05.470 --> 08:06.051
It certainly is.

08:06.071 --> 08:06.591
A musical instrument.

08:08.313 --> 08:09.394
Of course, I began.

08:10.275 --> 08:12.277
My first art was music.

08:15.140 --> 08:18.603
You said that people today do not seem to have a sense of rhythm, though.

08:18.683 --> 08:20.445
Were you talking about...

08:20.695 --> 08:21.656
more recent poetry.

08:21.717 --> 08:22.117
Yes.

08:22.658 --> 08:24.781
Do you find that changing now?

08:26.664 --> 08:43.309
Well, it's hard to see it or to define it, but let me say this.

08:43.369 --> 08:46.534
The reason I said that was because

08:46.885 --> 09:15.036
because my experience in teaching poetry was when I found that my students really did not know how to read poetry, and did not realize that we are a language of strong stresses and then weak syllables, and that

09:15.488 --> 09:24.660
The music of poetry is dependent on the variation of that pulsing of the sound.

09:27.104 --> 09:43.065
This is the art of poetry, really, is to manage, to control the flow of the stresses and the slacks.

09:43.383 --> 09:50.753
and to compound them into a variable flow of language.

09:50.773 --> 10:01.447
I know your own record is saying that poetry written at certain points in your life is completed work and speaks for that time of your life.

10:01.467 --> 10:02.048
Of course.

10:02.348 --> 10:07.956
I mean, Wordsworth went back and rewrote some of his poetry very badly, I think, in that case.

10:08.375 --> 10:10.378
Completed work should be completed work.

10:10.398 --> 10:10.959
You said that.

10:11.179 --> 10:20.313
But do you ever, when you're giving readings like you did last night, as you're doing a poem, are you ever tempted to tinker with it as you're reading it?

10:20.333 --> 10:25.901
Oh, I have tinkered with those poems a hundred times before the reading.

10:26.321 --> 10:31.850
So I'm not likely to start doing it.

10:33.172 --> 10:34.033
Do you ever feel anything?

10:34.393 --> 10:37.538
Yeah, sometimes...

10:38.581 --> 11:07.255
reading a poem I learn that there is something wrong with its rhythmic flow because I find difficulty reading it with the right emphasis and then I go back to it and with the advantage of

11:07.673 --> 11:18.531
speaking it loud over and over again, I find a way of praising it that is natural for the human voice and gives the proper emphasis.

11:18.571 --> 11:25.722
There's certainly poetry that endures for the generations and other examples that disappear.

11:25.743 --> 11:31.572
What is it, do you think, you're a student of poetry, you've taught literature?

11:32.243 --> 11:42.095
What do you think the best poems have that allow them to resonate beyond the lifetime of the artist?

11:44.378 --> 12:01.660
Well, I think that Keats maybe defined it when he spoke of poetry as being true to feeling.

12:03.142 --> 12:13.937
The sense that it comes out of human impulses that are not lying, that are telling the truth about the human condition.

12:13.957 --> 12:20.205
I think that above all is what people respond to.

12:24.371 --> 12:32.001
The poetry that sounds

12:32.960 --> 12:58.579
as though it were a manufactured thing in which you are more conscious of the technique than of the person who has written the poem or the thing being said is, I think, the

13:00.179 --> 13:10.532
characteristic of a poetry that is no longer capable of steering human responses.

13:11.073 --> 13:13.256
I am bothered by the water.

13:13.456 --> 13:16.160
It is a distraction.

13:18.683 --> 13:20.005
You don't call it a foreword.

13:20.345 --> 13:22.448
No, I say instead of a foreword.

13:22.468 --> 13:25.512
But it really is a very, very eloquent statement, I think.

13:26.234 --> 13:28.597
Oh, I've read it very, very carefully.

13:28.757 --> 13:34.686
Yeah, well, it's a distillation of things I've been thinking about and writing about for years.

13:35.326 --> 13:40.233
I'm interested, and it does speak quite eloquently, which is why I really haven't asked you to comment on it.

13:40.253 --> 13:42.316
It's there for me to see.

13:42.336 --> 13:50.287
I am interested, though, in a further exploration, though, of poetry, your sense of poetry, as mythology, which you do stand in there.

13:50.808 --> 13:54.793
I think that's my central theme.

13:54.813 --> 13:55.414
And that's...

13:55.597 --> 14:22.887
Has that always been your sense of the... I mean, you have certainly been... Well, I think it became manifest to me after my first book, when I tried to find a direction,

14:23.980 --> 14:33.936
a path that I could take as a person, as a poet.

14:35.799 --> 14:44.252
And I began to think of my life in terms of what I was seeking for.

14:44.272 --> 14:46.856
In other words, what is my quest?

14:47.798 --> 14:49.701
The moment I asked that question,

14:50.660 --> 14:55.308
I realized that I was speaking in mythological terms.

14:56.650 --> 14:59.635
And how do you define mythology, by the way?

14:59.675 --> 15:01.658
Not, I mean, in the classical sense?

15:01.778 --> 15:05.545
Well, I'm using it in very broad, broad terms.

15:08.049 --> 15:17.224
I feel that, well, as I define it in those remarks,

15:17.710 --> 15:30.586
I say that poetry is ultimately mythology, the telling of the stories of the soul, in its passage through the valley of this life.

15:31.967 --> 15:35.852
You see, that's certainly a mythological concept.

15:36.433 --> 15:44.983
And I had to find that, that is to say, it's adventure in time and history.

15:46.347 --> 15:49.271
I'm interested also that you have an index in this book.

15:49.631 --> 15:49.952
Yes.

15:50.012 --> 15:55.018
That's quite unusual for a volume of poetry, isn't it?

15:55.559 --> 16:05.792
Well, this is a collection over a good span of years, and I like the idea that you... I do, too.

16:05.953 --> 16:09.477
I really... I insisted on it.

16:09.497 --> 16:09.898
Did you?

16:09.958 --> 16:12.321
Yes, my publisher was...

16:12.740 --> 16:14.602
I had not thought of it.

16:14.642 --> 16:18.988
This is my new publisher, incidentally, so we're getting acquainted with each other.

16:19.008 --> 16:20.871
And I like your writing, by the way.

16:20.891 --> 16:28.020
Well, I'm so happy to have left Little Brown that I felt terribly unhappy.

16:28.040 --> 16:30.483
Well, they're time-life.

16:30.503 --> 16:31.064
They're time-life now.

16:31.084 --> 16:36.511
I never even had an editor there, and nobody who cares.

16:38.013 --> 16:40.536
But they were very tough in...

16:41.512 --> 16:53.989
Letting me go, because they insisted that I could not leave unless I bought my rights.

16:54.170 --> 16:56.473
Isn't that terrible?

16:56.493 --> 16:57.594
And did you have to do that?

16:57.694 --> 17:02.081
I paid a fantastic sum just to get out.

17:02.721 --> 17:05.325
It was that uncomfortable.

17:06.183 --> 17:08.206
It was that uncomfortable for you being with them.

17:08.226 --> 17:11.491
Well, it certainly made me unhappy.

17:12.152 --> 17:14.114
Well, I love Norton.

17:14.134 --> 17:16.137
Well, they care.

17:16.778 --> 17:19.162
It's an employee-owned company.

17:19.182 --> 17:23.808
They own the company, and they have a sense of literature.

17:23.848 --> 17:24.749
They care.

17:24.770 --> 17:26.852
I mean, they don't publish a frivolous book.

17:26.873 --> 17:32.140
There's not a single book that comes out of their list that's a frivolous book.

17:32.255 --> 17:36.079
Every book is an attempt to do a good book well.

17:36.120 --> 17:43.308
You don't find books on their list that are in there to bring up the growth, so to speak.

17:43.368 --> 17:50.336
Even Patrick O'Brien, who has his following as a genre writer, that's serious literature, in my view.

17:50.356 --> 17:57.064
I mean, it's entertaining, but the man really does write about, you know, a tradition that...

17:57.820 --> 17:59.001
Anyway, congratulations.

17:59.062 --> 17:59.822
And it is beautiful.

18:00.243 --> 18:05.209
So, when you say an editor, of course, what does an editor offer to a poet?

18:07.592 --> 18:10.535
Is it more or less shepherding you?

18:10.616 --> 18:16.983
In my case, it's sympathy.

18:17.083 --> 18:18.665
Encouragement.

18:18.685 --> 18:21.449
A sense of pleasure in the association.

18:24.372 --> 18:26.595
I've never had an editor who...

18:26.862 --> 18:29.125
ever edited any of my poems.

18:30.287 --> 18:33.412
So that isn't what I'm looking for.

18:33.432 --> 18:43.887
But you're looking for somebody who can shepherd you through the process of... And take care of details that... Help you get the right desk jacket.

18:43.907 --> 18:47.472
Oh, well, we... This is largely my doing.

18:48.674 --> 18:56.025
And because my editor, Carol Hugsmith, really was happy to...

18:56.680 --> 19:00.705
have me under her wing.

19:01.447 --> 19:10.018
She went out and got a, I think, the best designer of poetry books around, Tree Swenson.

19:10.058 --> 19:15.846
The first time they'd ever hired Tree to do a book for them.

19:15.866 --> 19:19.371
And, yeah, that's the kind of thing you want from her.

19:19.391 --> 19:23.076
It's wonderful, and I'm thrilled to have it.

19:23.832 --> 19:34.945
In the Moyers interview, I think, and elsewhere, you've also stated that come about the age of 50, a poet has pretty much covered the terrain, the visible terrain.

19:34.965 --> 19:35.846
Yes.

19:36.226 --> 19:37.548
Then he has to explore.

19:38.329 --> 19:41.632
But you've had four years of exploration since then.

19:41.652 --> 19:47.019
Has it been difficult for you to discover new veins?

19:48.200 --> 19:52.725
Well, when you're young...

19:53.971 --> 19:58.939
Poems come to you unannounced.

19:59.540 --> 20:06.531
You know, they're delivered at your doorstep every morning, like the daily news.

20:13.181 --> 20:20.012
But when you're at my age, poems are...

20:21.545 --> 20:24.447
buried under the debris of the life.

20:27.130 --> 20:29.392
And you have to dig for them.

20:29.412 --> 20:33.535
When you say the debris, you mean just the years?

20:33.955 --> 20:38.639
All the mess, all the increment, all the waste.

20:38.960 --> 20:41.462
Are you searching, however, for... All the incidents.

20:42.843 --> 20:43.684
What is vital?

20:43.764 --> 20:45.045
What is important to you?

20:45.405 --> 20:49.809
What pertains to your deepest mythic self?

20:50.569 --> 20:51.450
That's something.

20:51.886 --> 20:59.415
That's why I don't write occasional poems, because they're only a distraction as far as I'm concerned.

20:59.435 --> 21:02.058
You meant you used the phrase, poems come to you.

21:02.879 --> 21:06.943
Is that a fair description of the creative process?

21:07.043 --> 21:08.385
Do poems come to you?

21:08.405 --> 21:11.689
Do you visualize them, see them, feel them?

21:11.849 --> 21:17.696
Well, what I just said was that in one's youth poems... I understand.

21:17.716 --> 21:21.420
I guess I'm trying to get on to, if you can articulate

21:21.772 --> 21:31.524
Because it's very difficult, the creative process for you, where these things come from, where these wonderful things come from, faithful things.

21:31.544 --> 21:35.269
But you understand what I'm driving at.

21:35.309 --> 21:38.112
But there is a difference, you see, between these stages.

21:38.252 --> 21:47.404
What I'm trying to say is that in one's early years, poems do come to you.

21:48.105 --> 21:49.246
They're delivered to you.

21:49.346 --> 21:50.007
They're...

21:50.830 --> 22:02.461
because you are that kind of person, because you are open to experience, because you love language, because you feel there's something you want to say.

22:02.481 --> 22:19.858
And everything is fresh and exciting and wonderful and strange, mysterious in one's youth, and one's in love, and that, you see?

22:20.176 --> 22:33.275
Eliot said something once in one of his essays, that in one's youth, poetry is a glandular process.

22:34.677 --> 22:35.238
Very good.

22:35.258 --> 22:39.805
He didn't say it quite like that, but that was... Right, I got the point.

22:39.953 --> 22:42.075
Hormonal, to be sure.

22:42.095 --> 22:43.017
Yeah.

22:43.037 --> 22:44.638
Well, what does Prospero's daughter say?

22:44.678 --> 22:45.660
Brave new world.

22:45.720 --> 22:47.822
And he says, "'Tis new to thee."

22:47.842 --> 22:51.206
I mean, that's his rejoinder in, "'Tis new to thee."

22:52.247 --> 22:56.312
And he's speaking from his side of the line.

22:56.352 --> 23:03.100
Do you think in imagery, do images populate your conscious thoughts?

23:03.300 --> 23:05.202
I think in images...

23:06.852 --> 23:10.155
But my poems often begin with rhythms.

23:10.776 --> 23:11.076
Really?

23:13.258 --> 23:16.101
Rhythms that attach themselves to images.

23:17.102 --> 23:20.105
That's interesting.

23:20.286 --> 23:28.414
And I can tell when the process is going astray, because there's a separation there.

23:30.676 --> 23:36.522
But once I find the rhythm, I can mount on it.

23:36.957 --> 23:43.647
Are the themes that you explore, are they mindfully explored?

23:45.630 --> 23:52.761
Because there are certainly themes that I think we can trace through the body of your work.

23:53.042 --> 24:04.720
Most of the themes that I explore these days are

24:08.041 --> 24:16.591
are not in my conscious life at all.

24:18.534 --> 24:26.323
That's why I said I have to dig for them, because they're under the threshold of consciousness.

24:27.525 --> 24:35.314
They belong to deep memory, to lost memory often.

24:36.847 --> 24:41.411
And the process has to do with finding what it is.

24:41.471 --> 24:46.775
What is stirring down there that wants to get out?

24:48.897 --> 24:53.701
How do you catalyze this process?

24:53.761 --> 24:56.123
How do you stir the part?

24:56.143 --> 25:06.432
Well, most of my poems come to me in stages when

25:06.850 --> 25:23.887
I'm half asleep and half awake when there are no inhibitions and when the unconscious life has an opportunity to emerge.

25:25.869 --> 25:27.931
Often poems come to me in dreams.

25:28.992 --> 25:31.875
You're anticipating my next question.

25:33.796 --> 25:34.377
Yeah.

25:34.863 --> 25:40.573
Some of the poems that I feel closest to are really out of dreams.

25:40.593 --> 25:43.058
Well, Quinnipoxet, I think, is an example.

25:43.078 --> 25:49.129
Quinnipoxet is... Basically, I think, is entirely derived from... Yes, the whole poem came to me.

25:49.149 --> 25:51.553
Not in language, but in images.

25:53.336 --> 25:53.417
Wow.

25:53.437 --> 25:54.719
In one dream or a sequence?

25:54.739 --> 25:55.400
In one dream.

25:55.600 --> 25:57.023
In one dream, yes.

25:57.188 --> 26:02.936
So you woke up with this concept, I guess we would have to call it at that point.

26:02.956 --> 26:07.543
Another poem of mine, and one of my favorites, The Layers.

26:07.563 --> 26:09.085
I don't know if you know that poem.

26:11.068 --> 26:21.964
And the central passage in that poem are these words, Live in the layers, not on the litter.

26:23.366 --> 26:24.748
That came to me in a dream.

26:25.066 --> 26:27.889
I woke and I wrote it down immediately.

26:28.150 --> 26:32.495
It was written out to me as though to say, don't forget it.

26:32.515 --> 26:40.946
And I find if you do have things in your sleep or you wake up, if you don't write them down, they are gone forever.

26:41.546 --> 26:46.112
Do you ever wake up with solutions to problems that have been perplexing you?

26:46.852 --> 26:50.197
as opposed to... Yes.

26:50.897 --> 26:51.679
It has happened.

26:53.120 --> 26:56.866
I don't think it's an infallible process.

26:56.906 --> 26:57.246
Sometimes.

26:57.366 --> 27:02.854
But on occasion, yes.

27:03.094 --> 27:07.900
But you can't... Is there any way to prepare yourself for the process?

27:07.920 --> 27:09.142
I mean, do you go into a room?

27:09.162 --> 27:09.903
Do you garden?

27:09.983 --> 27:11.746
Do you have a good night's sleep?

27:11.786 --> 27:15.711
Gardening is, for me, one...

27:16.366 --> 27:29.520
I think of gardening as a meditation, an opportunity for meditation, while I'm working around the plants, while I'm weeding or killing or whatnot.

27:30.060 --> 27:41.532
That's what's going on in my head, while my hands are busy with toil.

27:41.892 --> 27:44.635
So it's never possible for you to...

27:45.104 --> 27:50.933
entirely immerse yourself in the tilling or the planting or the weeding and all these things?

27:50.953 --> 27:54.738
Well, sometimes one loses oneself in that, too.

27:55.099 --> 28:06.316
But I've also read a wonderful quote where you actually, I mean, you see gardening and planting as an extension of what you're doing as a poet and what your function is.

28:06.436 --> 28:09.220
I think of gardening, too, in mythic terms.

28:11.664 --> 28:14.588
As I've said,

28:14.888 --> 28:23.780
in several interviews when asked about gardening, that to me it is the process of death and resurrection.

28:24.721 --> 28:29.387
And one is instrumental in the resurrection process.

28:29.487 --> 28:33.012
That's a wonderful, exhilarating thought.

28:33.793 --> 28:36.677
And your garden, of course, is for beauty.

28:36.792 --> 28:41.477
It's not for the table, so to speak.

28:41.497 --> 28:43.540
Are you familiar with the Celia Thaxter book?

28:43.940 --> 28:45.242
Oh, yes, of course.

28:45.442 --> 28:47.725
And with the Hasselman.

28:47.785 --> 28:49.747
I have a first edition of that.

28:50.608 --> 28:53.331
My garden, in a way, I hadn't mined.

28:53.571 --> 28:56.034
It's about the same proportions as her garden.

28:56.054 --> 28:56.354
Really?

28:57.676 --> 29:06.546
And I, as a matter of fact, I reviewed the Celia Thaxter book for the times as I remember.

29:07.235 --> 29:11.062
Yes.

29:11.683 --> 29:21.019
But, well, in the New Yorker piece, I talk a bit about my garden and the theory behind it.

29:21.580 --> 29:23.744
So you can get it from there.

29:24.044 --> 29:26.188
Okay, good.

29:28.733 --> 29:33.358
I find it interesting also that you worked briefly with the Worcester Telegram.

29:33.958 --> 29:34.399
Yes.

29:35.139 --> 29:38.403
I think you were, you did some literary things, is that well?

29:38.423 --> 29:41.726
Yes, for the Sunday section.

29:41.746 --> 29:44.509
Which was my, which was my later years.

29:46.591 --> 29:55.500
I did real literary stuff that no longer would be tolerated in a paper.

29:55.632 --> 30:15.235
I did, for example, a whole series of parodies, really, of the style of contemporary writers at that period.

30:15.255 --> 30:15.516
That's great.

30:15.656 --> 30:19.941
Sherwood Anderson, I remember, D.H.

30:19.961 --> 30:21.563
Lawrence, Joyce.

30:22.123 --> 30:22.824
Were they signed?

30:24.646 --> 30:25.167
Did I?

30:25.501 --> 30:28.824
I might look them up on microfilm.

30:28.944 --> 30:32.648
I don't know how good they were.

30:32.668 --> 30:36.871
I was in my early 20s when I was doing that.

30:37.452 --> 30:42.517
When you were in your early 20s, did you see yourself then?

30:42.617 --> 30:45.980
That would have been about 1925, I guess, or so.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.103
Your first volume of published poetry is 1930.

30:50.104 --> 30:53.787
Was there some epiphanous moment where you said, I'm a poet?

30:54.357 --> 30:57.321
Oh, I thought of that long before.

30:58.702 --> 31:02.367
Even in my early teens, yeah.

31:02.387 --> 31:18.668
So it was something that you... I have a note in this volume attached to the testing tree, which I think is the central poem of my early years.

31:19.529 --> 31:22.913
And I tell about...

31:23.973 --> 31:27.699
roaming through the woods behind our house there.

31:29.161 --> 31:31.084
Big, open, dense woods.

31:31.424 --> 31:36.892
Not open there, but long stretches of wood.

31:36.912 --> 31:51.174
And I played this game that I invented, throwing stones at a... There was a big white oak, the central tree in that whole forest.

31:51.194 --> 31:53.457
And if I hit the trunk once,

31:55.664 --> 31:58.348
Let's see how that went.

31:58.869 --> 32:03.876
If I hit the trunk once, somebody would love me.

32:03.896 --> 32:09.624
And if I hit it twice out of my three throws, I would be a poet.

32:10.345 --> 32:13.650
And if I hit all three times, I would never die.

32:15.252 --> 32:19.599
That was when I was maybe 12 years old.

32:19.619 --> 32:23.865
Did you recognize this then as poetry?

32:24.520 --> 32:27.264
as something stirring, certainly.

32:27.484 --> 32:29.727
Yeah, well, I was so excited.

32:29.767 --> 32:32.170
And I did this every day after school.

32:32.190 --> 32:35.214
And you also... And I got awfully proficient at that.

32:35.815 --> 32:38.679
I never missed.

32:38.799 --> 32:44.426
And you used to enjoy the feel of words, I guess, saying them aloud.

32:44.807 --> 32:46.349
And I still think of those.

32:46.389 --> 32:48.371
See, I picked those stones very carefully.

32:48.431 --> 32:51.135
That's what I did on my way home from school.

32:51.335 --> 32:59.545
I picked smooth, like eggs, you know, stones that you could throw accurately.

32:59.565 --> 33:03.890
And I kept them in my pocket.

33:05.933 --> 33:13.242
And still, when I'm writing a poem, I often feel as though I'm holding those stones in my hand.

33:13.964 --> 33:17.789
Is there a tactile relationship between you and the poem?

33:18.009 --> 33:18.330
Yeah.

33:18.510 --> 33:19.872
Touch is very important.

33:19.892 --> 33:22.275
But in the creation of the poem itself.

33:22.315 --> 33:26.761
It really does have to pass through your hand to the paper.

33:27.102 --> 33:27.722
Oh, yes.

33:27.742 --> 33:31.027
That's why I write by hand.

33:31.047 --> 33:32.509
Always stop by pause.

33:32.529 --> 33:34.251
A pencil or a pencil?

33:34.552 --> 33:40.761
I write... Well, I usually start with a pencil so I can... Maybe fool around with it a little bit.

33:41.002 --> 33:45.849
Then I move to a pen, and gradually I move to a manual typewriter.

33:45.869 --> 33:46.230
How you doing?

33:46.250 --> 33:47.632
And that's as far as I go.

33:48.213 --> 33:50.897
Have you ever toyed with a computer?

33:51.037 --> 33:53.200
Yes, but not successfully.

33:54.242 --> 33:57.187
I feel too remote.

33:57.627 --> 34:00.812
I lack that bodily...

34:01.619 --> 34:04.665
touch that I need for poetry.

34:04.685 --> 34:07.109
So there is a tactile element, very definitely.

34:07.129 --> 34:08.391
Very much so.

34:08.472 --> 34:09.113
Very much so.

34:09.133 --> 34:09.834
That's wonderful.

34:10.255 --> 34:17.228
You know, I have a daughter who's 13, and if you say to her, Nicole, write a haiku or something, she has this feel.

34:17.248 --> 34:24.501
But I feel that in school, they do nothing to encourage a child to love poetry.

34:24.962 --> 34:25.062
Yeah.

34:25.463 --> 34:29.670
The way even it was in my time, and certainly in your time.

34:29.690 --> 34:35.018
That goes back to your earlier question about poetry in our culture.

34:36.280 --> 34:53.867
One of the miserable failures of our society is the education system, and its abandonment of poetry and the fact

34:54.117 --> 35:09.312
making poetries torture and separating the child who has a natural poetic impulse from delight in the word.

35:10.113 --> 35:21.725
There's no understanding that if they would only build on nursery rhymes, counting rhymes, that's the basis of the poem.

35:22.065 --> 35:23.787
Every child loves those.

35:24.087 --> 35:24.808
They do.

35:24.828 --> 35:25.569
They love them.

35:25.589 --> 35:25.889
Yeah.

35:25.909 --> 35:27.350
Children love poetry.

35:27.991 --> 35:31.615
And they have a receptivity to it, I think, as well.

35:31.835 --> 35:35.719
And then it's killed off in the schools.

35:35.739 --> 35:38.042
And I wonder what's occasioned that.

35:38.502 --> 35:43.287
Is it an arrogance on the part of... It's ignorance.

35:43.307 --> 35:48.012
Or is it a response to this mass media culture and television and rock music?

35:48.192 --> 35:53.858
But so many of the teachers in the school system have no...

35:54.445 --> 35:57.029
feeling for poetry.

35:57.069 --> 35:58.031
How can they teach it?

36:00.134 --> 36:04.481
So, you're here, but you certainly are hopeful for poetry.

36:04.541 --> 36:07.866
Well, I think there is a simmering going on.

36:07.886 --> 36:16.099
There is a, on the outer edges

36:18.037 --> 36:21.421
There is a lot of excitement about it.

36:21.721 --> 36:24.564
It even goes into rap.

36:24.584 --> 36:26.086
It's amazing.

36:27.548 --> 36:30.931
And slam, grand slams and those things.

36:32.593 --> 36:35.196
It doesn't matter whether they're good or bad.

36:35.216 --> 36:38.320
You don't judge them academically.

36:38.660 --> 36:42.044
But it's a demonstration of the vitality of it.

36:42.064 --> 36:43.225
It will not die.

36:43.245 --> 36:47.470
Now you're 90 years old.

36:47.652 --> 36:48.153
Yes.

36:48.833 --> 37:00.387
And do you foresee, what do you see in the, I mean, the arc of your career is still, it's still a work in progress, isn't it?

37:00.728 --> 37:02.890
Amazingly so, even to me.

37:04.112 --> 37:13.483
See, I don't think of myself as, yes, the calendar says 90, but I don't feel 90.

37:14.184 --> 37:16.647
My companions are young people.

37:17.015 --> 37:22.241
poets, young poets largely, young painters and so forth.

37:23.402 --> 37:27.087
That's the world that I really live in.

37:28.909 --> 37:45.047
And, you know, I felt yesterday there was a reception at the house I was raised in, in Worcester, by the present occupants of that house, the stockpiles.

37:45.550 --> 37:49.054
who have sort of adopted me, and who say I still live there.

37:49.635 --> 37:52.178
And, in fact, they have a room devoted to me.

37:52.238 --> 37:53.420
Do you remember it very well?

37:54.081 --> 37:55.482
As your memory of it was very clear?

37:55.883 --> 37:56.864
Of that house?

37:56.884 --> 37:57.164
Yeah.

37:57.185 --> 37:57.465
Yes.

37:57.925 --> 37:58.927
But they've restored it.

37:59.848 --> 38:03.733
They've restored it to its original condition, actually.

38:04.414 --> 38:06.656
They're wonderful people.

38:06.676 --> 38:08.539
They're non-literary.

38:08.579 --> 38:09.600
They're working people.

38:09.749 --> 38:17.817
But they really love me, and then the fact that I lived in that house means so much to them.

38:19.058 --> 38:35.515
It's an extraordinary thing, and that shows you how poetry does mean something to non-literary people as well, if they are immersed in it, if they can get the sense of it.

38:35.855 --> 38:39.739
When you see your room as it was,

38:40.040 --> 38:41.121
80 years ago?

38:41.181 --> 38:44.044
Does this evoke anything for you?

38:45.826 --> 38:54.754
Well, my feeling was when I crossed the threshold of that house, I was 12 years old again.

38:54.814 --> 38:55.975
Really?

38:56.256 --> 38:57.697
Yes.

38:57.717 --> 39:01.020
All the rush of memories came back.

39:01.080 --> 39:02.141
And this was just yesterday?

39:02.202 --> 39:03.082
Yes, yesterday.

39:03.243 --> 39:04.944
And this is the first time you've been back?

39:06.446 --> 39:06.686
No.

39:07.407 --> 39:08.848
On my 80th,

39:09.183 --> 39:10.865
Anniversary is the first time.

39:10.885 --> 39:11.405
It's every summer?

39:11.425 --> 39:12.306
It's the first time.

39:14.308 --> 39:14.908
Wow.

39:15.149 --> 39:21.274
And I've been back, well, I think I've been there once, between.

39:22.035 --> 39:26.379
But going into that house is going into my childhood.

39:26.539 --> 39:31.123
It's... And all the years drop away from it.

39:31.684 --> 39:35.087
Isn't that amazing?

39:35.347 --> 39:36.068
That's...

39:36.959 --> 39:40.945
In that corner was a green Morris chair that existed.

39:40.965 --> 39:42.567
I mean, it was in the library.

39:44.730 --> 40:04.198
Did your brief experience as a journalist bring anything to your vision, I guess, to the vision that's... I guess you do look at things in a very... The great thing I remember from my years of the telegram was

40:04.702 --> 40:06.664
the motto on the wall.

40:07.485 --> 40:09.848
I know it was there when you were there.

40:09.888 --> 40:14.814
It probably didn't remove, but it said... Accuracy.

40:14.834 --> 40:15.215
Accuracy.

40:15.275 --> 40:15.975
Accuracy.

40:16.176 --> 40:19.460
It's gone now, but it was there when I first came in.

40:19.780 --> 40:21.282
And once again, accuracy.

40:21.362 --> 40:24.185
And once again, accuracy.

40:24.205 --> 40:29.151
Which actually, I guess they attributed it to Booth, but it was really Joseph Phillips' line.

40:29.672 --> 40:31.334
It was Joseph Phillips.

40:31.394 --> 40:33.156
Yeah, it was Phillips' line.

40:33.490 --> 40:35.332
I've never forgotten that.

40:35.653 --> 40:38.716
It's a valid admonition, isn't it?

40:38.736 --> 40:51.931
And I think even for a poet, accuracy of observation, accuracy of perception, that's something one has to insist on.

40:52.232 --> 40:54.314
Well, that is a gift, isn't it?

40:54.334 --> 40:59.180
It's a gift so much, but it is a lesson that has proved of value to you.

40:59.901 --> 41:01.843
In a way, I think

41:02.212 --> 41:12.044
The poets of today, by, for the most part, being unable to support themselves with their art, are liberated in many ways, aren't they?

41:12.064 --> 41:16.329
They are more free, don't you think, to tell the truth with a captain?

41:16.349 --> 41:28.523
Unfortunately, most poets who survive in this society survive as academics.

41:29.819 --> 41:31.842
That's the refuge for the poet.

41:31.862 --> 41:35.987
That's the support for the poet.

41:36.248 --> 41:38.270
And that's the means of survival.

41:39.492 --> 41:58.898
And I believe that though it's, there's a positive there, certainly, in that it makes survival possible.

41:59.722 --> 42:04.128
it also has a deleterious influence.

42:06.371 --> 42:22.732
In my own case, for example, I didn't start to teach until, I didn't dare think of teaching until 20 years after I graduated from college.

42:24.455 --> 42:28.480
And then I was scared to death that I would become an academic.

42:28.932 --> 42:30.794
And I never accepted tenure.

42:33.057 --> 42:47.114
So I worked through a long career in the academy, teaching poetry, arts, and creative writing classes, but always on an annual contract.

42:47.615 --> 42:55.665
There was, however, an instance early in your life where you offered a position, or you weren't offered a position, you were denied a position, I guess, because you're Jewish.

42:56.658 --> 42:58.241
That was very early.

42:58.381 --> 42:59.923
Well, that's what divorced me.

42:59.943 --> 43:02.568
But, I mean, that must have had an influence.

43:02.588 --> 43:03.008
Oh, certainly.

43:03.189 --> 43:04.330
Oh, yeah.

43:04.350 --> 43:06.233
That was a real crisis.

43:06.975 --> 43:08.377
That was a real crisis.

43:08.397 --> 43:22.800
But maybe it helps shape the poet that became... When Harvard, a couple of years ago, gave me its Centennial Medal, I said that...

43:23.523 --> 43:44.969
Though it was a terrible wound when I was rejected, it had been a great stroke of fortune on my part that I did not become acceptable in the academic world at that time.

43:44.989 --> 43:48.893
One of these unseen blessings at the time, isn't it?

43:48.913 --> 43:52.838
I won't take up too much of your time, because we've had a wonderful hour.

43:53.577 --> 43:58.783
And I look forward to many more wonderful poems.

43:59.204 --> 44:00.345
Poems are hard work.

44:00.365 --> 44:02.468
I think that's an important thing to point out.

44:02.488 --> 44:04.751
It's not something you can snap off, is it?

44:04.771 --> 44:06.473
It's the most difficult.

44:06.693 --> 44:07.394
It's the life.

44:09.637 --> 44:14.463
But it cannot be the purpose of the life.

44:14.543 --> 44:15.804
That's the other thing.

44:16.225 --> 44:18.488
It has to be for the sake of the life.

44:19.409 --> 44:20.530
When do you know it's done?

44:20.780 --> 44:22.342
When it sounds right, when it feels right.

44:22.362 --> 44:23.364
When it sounds right.

44:23.965 --> 44:26.548
After I read it in public, then I know.

44:27.370 --> 44:29.373
You can gauge the response?

44:29.393 --> 44:31.315
Well, I can tell.

44:31.395 --> 44:42.351
There are certain poems that I value and I know are right, but that I never read.

44:42.371 --> 44:48.981
A poem that one reads, chooses to read,

44:50.345 --> 45:04.506
is one that can be grasped immediately, that doesn't require elaborate introduction or explanation of any kind.

45:05.627 --> 45:13.999
And that simply has such a flow of emotion, feeling, truth, whatever it is, that there it is.

45:14.039 --> 45:20.048
Is reading in public, then, an element of the creative process for you?

45:20.281 --> 45:22.023
part of the communication.

45:22.824 --> 45:32.737
It's like the old bards who ridden the streets and at ceremonial occasions.

45:34.880 --> 45:39.726
It's, poetry hasn't varied, I think.

45:41.508 --> 45:45.173
In itself, it is society that has changed.

45:46.775 --> 45:50.119
You know, it's true, when you think of writers, the greatest calling

45:50.369 --> 45:52.231
if you're a writer, I guess.

45:52.792 --> 45:53.773
I mean, you go up the ladder.

45:54.214 --> 45:57.137
Every nonfiction writer like myself would like to do a novel.

45:57.177 --> 46:00.721
Then you talk to the novelists, they would all like to be a poet.

46:01.042 --> 46:02.423
Look at Updike, for instance.

46:02.503 --> 46:05.127
I mean, he craves recognition as a poet.

46:05.147 --> 46:05.947
I know, I know.

46:05.968 --> 46:09.091
And he's a wonderful short story writer and a fine novelist.

46:09.752 --> 46:11.454
But he is very deftly.

46:11.474 --> 46:18.182
Well, he understands poetry technically.

46:18.382 --> 46:22.547
Technically, he writes very good poems.

46:23.268 --> 46:36.625
They understand the poetic medium, but obviously, he is not a poet in his imagination.

46:37.286 --> 46:39.088
He's a wonderful fiction writer.

46:39.108 --> 46:39.369
Is it?

46:39.449 --> 46:42.212
And I won't make any references to Uptek in this book.

46:42.292 --> 46:42.873
Naturally.

46:43.514 --> 46:44.836
But is it a gift, then?

46:45.577 --> 46:46.718
Something that you can't...

46:47.558 --> 46:52.924
It's a gift, but maybe everybody has a portion of that gift.

46:53.385 --> 46:56.428
But some have it.

46:57.209 --> 47:04.678
Often, I think, the gift is there.

47:04.798 --> 47:08.482
I see it in so many young persons.

47:10.465 --> 47:13.949
But it is stifled.

47:15.811 --> 47:16.772
Sometimes,

47:17.562 --> 47:25.250
by, simply by the education system, sometimes by the circumstances of life.

47:26.472 --> 47:33.800
One has to yearn for something more than what the day gives you in order to become a poet.

47:34.821 --> 47:38.185
That's a wonderful quote to put on, I think.

47:38.205 --> 47:43.030
Could you... Okay, we're back on again.

47:45.862 --> 48:15.683
It occurred to me, just as I was reading last night, that in terms of my statement about poetry being ultimately mythology, that in my own case, the perception began when I realized that my poetry was inseparable from

48:17.823 --> 48:21.347
the quest for the father.

48:21.407 --> 48:28.335
And that led eventually to my other quest, the quest for a community.

48:31.198 --> 48:45.754
And that really is the core, I think, of the poetic impulse in me as it persists and is still there.

48:46.240 --> 48:50.829
because I'll never find that shining city that I dream about.

48:50.849 --> 48:55.598
I think that also relates to your going into the house.

48:56.019 --> 48:56.460
Yes.

48:56.480 --> 49:01.630
And going, shooting back over the threshold at 12 years old, isn't it?

49:01.650 --> 49:02.231
Yeah, yeah.

49:02.251 --> 49:03.333
It's all related, isn't it?

49:04.475 --> 49:05.678
Yeah.

49:05.698 --> 49:05.818
Okay.
