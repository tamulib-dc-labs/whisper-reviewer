00:01.820 --> 00:24.760
Well, you're aware that a lot of Greek Americans are angry about the Seminers for being there, not only that, for allowing themselves to be, so to speak, a point that the Republicans used here.

00:26.121 --> 00:28.243
Well, I give the Republicans credit.

00:29.004 --> 00:30.325
I thought he was very clever.

00:31.182 --> 00:36.109
And, you know, if you can get away with it, do it.

00:38.332 --> 00:54.974
But it's not... It seems to me that if one would normally have been there, irrespective of the ethnicity of the Democratic nominee, that's one thing.

00:54.994 --> 01:01.122
But since you've never been invited there before, and you're invited there only because

01:01.574 --> 01:02.235
No, I'm sorry.

01:02.295 --> 01:08.324
He was invited in previous Republican conventions.

01:08.584 --> 01:10.147
Is it next to... No.

01:10.708 --> 01:13.832
No.

01:13.852 --> 01:15.715
But there's a difference, though.

01:15.815 --> 01:29.235
Mr. Tsongas, the Greek-American community had a dream a few years ago to see a Paul Tsongas president in the White House.

01:33.451 --> 01:36.314
Will this dream be realized?

01:36.334 --> 01:36.554
No.

01:41.520 --> 01:43.081
People go on to different dreams.

01:45.484 --> 01:48.127
People dream now of Michael the Cocker's being in the White House.

01:48.147 --> 01:51.591
If he doesn't make it for the others, he won't come along.

01:52.292 --> 02:01.922
If you think about the Greek community and the values of the Greek community and the kinds of young people that are produced in the Greek community, somebody's going to get there.

02:02.662 --> 02:13.657
It may be Michael, it may not be Michael, but at some point those values mean something in this country, and somebody will come along.

02:15.900 --> 02:30.559
Do you have difficulty to tell me if you plan to get involved in public life again, and in what form?

02:31.180 --> 02:34.023
I have no difficulty because I have no plan.

02:34.704 --> 02:35.725
I will never run again.

02:36.366 --> 02:37.267
It's just not fair.

02:38.668 --> 02:41.632
My wife is just starting her law career here.

02:41.712 --> 02:43.373
My kids are doing very well.

02:46.096 --> 02:54.125
I think I have a role to play in terms of a lot of public issues, but I cannot do it as an elected official.

02:54.145 --> 02:55.727
One, I have no desire.

02:56.348 --> 02:57.329
I cannot run again.

02:57.349 --> 02:59.331
It's not in me.

02:59.598 --> 03:01.700
Once you leave the Senate, it's hard.

03:02.621 --> 03:03.702
What would you run for?

03:04.383 --> 03:06.445
You've been to the Senate.

03:06.525 --> 03:09.988
If I wanted to stay in politics, I would have stayed in the Senate.

03:10.008 --> 03:24.322
But I had decided, as you may know, several years ago to run for re-election, and that would have been it, and then try in 1988 for national office.

03:24.402 --> 03:27.445
But if that did not work, I would not have run again.

03:28.623 --> 03:38.618
So it's simply not fair to families, it's not fair to children to grow up in that kind of situation.

03:38.638 --> 03:55.643
If, when, allow me to use the term when, I like it better, when Mr. Lukakis is a electorate and he makes an offer to you to be a member of the American government, will you accept the offer?

03:56.635 --> 04:02.402
I have said that I would accept the offer if they agreed to move the seat of government to Cape Cod.

04:05.305 --> 04:06.086
That means no.

04:06.126 --> 04:07.468
That means absolutely no.

04:10.972 --> 04:22.025
Did you talk with Mr. Dukaitis prior to his decision of running for the presidency?

04:22.045 --> 04:22.265
Yes.

04:23.286 --> 04:24.167
Did he phone you?

04:24.287 --> 04:24.988
How did you...

04:25.812 --> 04:40.929
No, he asked me to come over, and I and my, one of my, the person who was my administrative assistant, who's now one of my mob partners, who ran my campaigns, we both went over, and we had a long discussion.

04:40.989 --> 04:44.373
I said, you ought to run, because you're better than these people.

04:45.053 --> 04:45.594
You're college.

04:45.834 --> 04:46.115
Yeah.

04:46.855 --> 04:47.897
And I said, I know them all.

04:48.637 --> 04:49.418
They were my friends.

04:50.359 --> 04:52.141
I served with them all, and you're better.

04:53.303 --> 04:53.743
And...

04:54.483 --> 04:57.047
I think at the time he was somewhat surprised by that.

04:57.267 --> 05:05.799
But I think after he'd been running against these people for a while, I think he realized that I was right.

05:05.819 --> 05:07.281
He's very bright.

05:07.301 --> 05:12.448
He's a very intelligent and extremely honest person.

05:12.949 --> 05:14.791
The most honest politician I've ever met.

05:16.213 --> 05:20.359
And I think that means something.

05:20.379 --> 05:23.443
And so I encouraged him to run.

05:25.516 --> 05:31.462
I came in late, but were you content with the debate last night?

05:32.964 --> 05:42.795
Well, I made the point that I used to, you know, do debates, and I'm always struck afterwards by how much people remembered style things.

05:43.916 --> 05:48.360
Like, I remember once I did a debate, my tie wasn't straight.

05:48.381 --> 05:55.388
And everybody talking about the tie wasn't straight.

05:55.688 --> 05:58.110
Television is a style medium.

05:59.552 --> 06:09.782
You really get, having been through the process, you really get the impression that what people are doing is more looking than listening.

06:11.003 --> 06:15.707
And I think in that respect, I've never seen Bush more comfortable and at ease.

06:16.488 --> 06:18.430
I just thought it was a marvelous performance.

06:18.530 --> 06:21.493
I thought if you read the transcript, it might be better.

06:21.929 --> 06:22.670
Without question.

06:24.051 --> 06:38.467
But I think, and I spoke, I listened to all the commentators after this, and I was on the phone late last night with people, and the general agreement was that this was a Bush that no one thought was possible.

06:39.608 --> 06:42.572
But he does keep surprising people.

06:42.592 --> 06:47.397
I know a year ago you were asked who among the Republicans

06:48.693 --> 06:52.037
you thought might make it, and you were picking Dole a year ago.

06:54.901 --> 06:56.183
You know, it's funny.

06:56.543 --> 06:57.845
I pulled the clips yesterday.

06:59.827 --> 07:03.392
I thought Dole would ring, because he's very substantive.

07:04.233 --> 07:05.795
I mean, that's a good example.

07:05.815 --> 07:08.779
But that's a good example of how the guy surprises you, perhaps, I guess.

07:09.660 --> 07:14.346
What he said about stop lying about me just killed his campaign.

07:14.748 --> 07:17.051
It just pressed out and it came through.

07:17.071 --> 07:17.852
It was nasty.

07:17.992 --> 07:20.595
It was two seconds of self-destruction, I think.

07:21.156 --> 07:25.641
I have to ask some different questions, because mine is more featurey as opposed to newsy.

07:26.282 --> 07:29.525
This is a magazine piece I'm doing for Anthony's magazine.

07:29.826 --> 07:33.310
A very quick one.

07:34.211 --> 07:41.920
How important is your Greek-American identity to you?

07:43.182 --> 07:51.812
I mean, your Greek background, your heretic descent, is it important?

07:51.832 --> 07:58.579
It's important not only in terms of your descent, but in terms of the values of the future.

07:59.380 --> 08:03.725
When I look back on the success that I've had, I say, why me?

08:03.805 --> 08:04.866
Why did I do it?

08:06.108 --> 08:09.652
And, you know, I live in Long, Massachusetts.

08:09.752 --> 08:12.615
I'm a small, you know, ethnic group.

08:13.523 --> 08:16.908
I'm not the most charismatic guy that ever came down that time.

08:16.948 --> 08:18.249
Why was I able to do it?"

08:18.390 --> 08:33.090
And what I decided one day was that it was what I learned growing up in hard work and education and valuing certain things that in the long run really mean a lot to you.

08:33.110 --> 08:39.278
So I think it's not only the fact that my father happens to be from Greece, I think

08:39.815 --> 08:42.118
That won't fade.

08:42.338 --> 08:47.844
My children are only half Greek, and their children get deluded.

08:48.785 --> 08:50.768
But the values are what's really important.

08:50.808 --> 08:56.454
And that is what Michael has, and why people are drawn to him.

08:57.215 --> 09:00.659
And that's what really has to be preserved.

09:01.260 --> 09:07.527
I happen to think that at some point, there's going to have to be some

09:08.992 --> 09:22.385
soul-searching on the part of the Greek community, about how you retain Greek loyalty in mixed families, mixed marriages, and the role of the Church.

09:23.026 --> 09:28.571
And it's something where I think there's not been a great deal of sensitivity.

09:29.772 --> 09:30.713
On the part of the Church?

09:31.934 --> 09:38.661
The Church obviously is dominated by people who

09:39.012 --> 09:41.455
think in the Greek context.

09:41.475 --> 09:45.078
And obviously, doctrine and politics will always reflect that.

09:45.098 --> 09:57.872
And I think it puts Greeks who are in a mixed marriage at a disadvantage with their children.

09:57.992 --> 10:07.602
And I know it's a very controversial kind of subject, but I think it's the particularly

10:07.835 --> 10:12.360
people who have mixed marriages, and in my case, for example, have only daughters.

10:13.461 --> 10:23.792
So the issue of what is the role of women in the Greek church as opposed to what is the role of women in the Episcopalian church where my wife grew up.

10:24.593 --> 10:37.707
Eventually, there's an inevitability that a larger percentage, for example, of women looking at the difference in doctrine are going to feel more comfortable going the other way.

10:38.615 --> 10:42.278
And I know that's happened in my family, and it's very bothersome.

10:43.499 --> 10:52.287
But you get to the point where you say, well, as long as they go to church and have some religious background, then that's fine.

10:52.467 --> 10:58.772
But the Greekness is going to get lost along the way.

10:58.892 --> 11:08.200
And so we try to think of ways artificially to create an environment where they will understand their heritage.

11:08.416 --> 11:12.520
So we talked about going to Greece and learning the language.

11:12.540 --> 11:13.661
Did you ever go, by the way?

11:13.862 --> 11:19.167
When I spoke to you in 82, you said, one thing I'm going to do is take the family to Greece.

11:19.367 --> 11:19.708
We did.

11:20.288 --> 11:21.249
When did you do that?

11:22.391 --> 11:23.292
We did in 83.

11:23.452 --> 11:24.213
It was the next year.

11:24.693 --> 11:27.576
Yeah, and we talked about going again.

11:28.457 --> 11:29.638
I've been there a couple of times.

11:30.219 --> 11:31.160
You mean since?

11:32.962 --> 11:34.543
Yeah, but not with them.

11:34.563 --> 11:36.145
But that one trip really did.

11:36.496 --> 11:39.239
more than anything else to really make them.

11:39.259 --> 11:43.823
It was fascinating because, you know, they've never been to Greece.

11:43.843 --> 11:44.984
They don't speak Greek.

11:45.084 --> 11:54.233
They've not, because of my father dying in 1980, they've not really been exposed to it in any real sense.

11:54.253 --> 11:59.719
And as I said, they're obviously much more comfortable in the festival church.

12:00.479 --> 12:04.123
But when they got there, they felt like this was home.

12:05.015 --> 12:12.346
It was a fascinating human behavior laboratory.

12:12.406 --> 12:15.570
They felt like they were rooted to the place.

12:15.590 --> 12:17.954
And it really surprised me.

12:18.675 --> 12:26.947
It made me feel very good that they instinctively knew this place meant something, and that they were part of it somehow.

12:26.967 --> 12:27.748
It's a continuum.

12:28.109 --> 12:29.551
It really is, and they're part of it.

12:29.851 --> 12:31.474
No, go ahead.

12:31.494 --> 12:33.276
I hope I can do this in 20 minutes.

12:33.737 --> 12:34.498
This is going to be tough.

12:35.170 --> 12:43.361
Let's start with your vision of liberalism as expressed in your book six years ago.

12:43.381 --> 12:51.993
I don't know how many times Bush used the word last night, how many times he's used it in the campaign.

12:52.054 --> 12:53.295
It's an attack.

12:53.315 --> 12:55.238
It's a dirty word.

12:55.859 --> 13:01.506
You felt that liberalism did have a future by combining pragmatism with compassion.

13:01.646 --> 13:02.287
How do you feel?

13:02.627 --> 13:06.852
How has the road from here gone over the six years since you published that book?

13:08.314 --> 13:10.657
Do you think that there is a future for liberalism?

13:10.717 --> 13:11.838
A wide question.

13:11.858 --> 13:13.540
You can't get anywhere you want.

13:13.560 --> 13:18.086
It's been eight years since there was a book.

13:18.446 --> 13:20.689
The book is a prop in my TV studio.

13:20.709 --> 13:23.352
Okay, but it was published maybe too, I think.

13:24.209 --> 13:29.276
It was written in the 80s, so it was published in the 81.

13:30.978 --> 13:35.084
Well, I mean, I think liberalism has limited appeal.

13:36.165 --> 13:40.611
And I did then and said that times change.

13:40.651 --> 13:41.772
You have to change with them.

13:41.793 --> 13:45.678
You have to be relevant to the problems other times.

13:45.698 --> 13:51.145
And there are a lot of issues where I don't, you know, for example,

13:51.817 --> 13:57.365
Capital gains taxes, like President used my name in vain in the first event.

13:58.327 --> 13:59.829
You know, I happen to agree.

13:59.869 --> 14:04.256
I happen to think you need a capital gains differential in equity.

14:04.276 --> 14:17.396
And I think if the Democrats had moved to that position, and most Democratic advisors agree with that, then Bush would not have that opportunity to say that kind of thing.

14:18.037 --> 14:20.220
Secondly, I'm for nuclear power.

14:21.027 --> 14:24.351
which is why I'm doing this commercial later on today.

14:25.052 --> 14:30.378
And again, you would have taken that issue away from Bush last night.

14:30.398 --> 14:37.006
And a lot of the economic issues— That's the pragmatic side, I think, of the liberalism issue.

14:37.987 --> 14:38.949
It's not only pragmatic.

14:39.009 --> 14:43.474
I think without it, I think it's hard to win a election.

14:44.129 --> 14:46.291
Well, that's pragmatism.

14:46.331 --> 14:51.656
That is also another element of pragmatism, I think, through that statement you just said.

14:51.676 --> 14:52.857
It's hard to win elections.

14:52.877 --> 14:54.258
I mean, it's a pragmatic statement.

14:55.139 --> 15:01.045
You know, when I, we did a poll towards the end of my, we used to poll out every three months.

15:01.065 --> 15:04.208
I'm a great believer in polls to find out what's going on.

15:05.069 --> 15:06.350
Martha, go sit.

15:07.070 --> 15:08.332
No, no.

15:08.572 --> 15:09.293
Oh, she's fine.

15:09.393 --> 15:13.056
Don't, she'll be with you from, she'll follow you home.

15:13.863 --> 15:26.239
We did a poll, and we asked people—we just threw it in, which we'd never done before—how do you perceive polling this as liberal, moderate, conservative?

15:26.900 --> 15:38.795
It ended up something like 26 percent—these numbers may not add up if you get the general point—26 percent liberal, 25 percent conservative, 45 percent moderate.

15:39.155 --> 15:39.496
Really?

15:39.996 --> 15:43.060
I can't believe you had 25 conservative.

15:43.310 --> 15:49.218
You know, for a lot of people, their view of me was working on economic development.

15:49.239 --> 15:50.420
Was this in Massachusetts, Paul?

15:50.520 --> 15:52.563
In Massachusetts.

15:53.024 --> 15:54.226
And, I mean, statewide.

15:54.847 --> 16:06.143
Because what people saw me doing and where I spent my time was trying to understand economics and how you put together an economy in a city or a state and working with high tech, that kind of thing.

16:06.243 --> 16:11.190
I mean, you were once rated the most liberal senator in the Senate, as I recall.

16:11.761 --> 16:18.270
It was fractionally higher than Ted, I think, but that's quite a perception from you.

16:18.771 --> 16:21.655
On social issues, I'm very liberal.

16:22.416 --> 16:32.830
You know, on issues like gay rights, women's rights, abortion, death penalty, sort of those kinds of things, I'm very liberal.

16:33.771 --> 16:36.815
On environmental issues, I'm very liberal.

16:37.857 --> 16:40.941
On third world issues, again,

16:41.613 --> 16:44.056
Well, Third World is different.

16:44.076 --> 16:47.961
I think it's much more pragmatic than how the world really shapes up.

16:48.842 --> 16:52.186
But I think on economic issues, I'm a conservative.

16:52.226 --> 16:57.153
I think if the economy goes to hell, the country goes to hell.

16:57.173 --> 16:58.034
It's that simple.

16:58.054 --> 17:02.660
And Democrats have never shown any interest in how you generate wealth.

17:03.601 --> 17:04.542
I see you sitting here.

17:04.582 --> 17:06.384
You appear content.

17:06.404 --> 17:08.447
You sound content.

17:08.933 --> 17:18.065
And I remember one of the questions I asked you, and this is prior to your decision to leave the Senate and the reason which prompted that.

17:18.225 --> 17:20.167
You said, I'm going to leave on my own terms.

17:20.528 --> 17:22.851
You have always felt that way, I think.

17:22.871 --> 17:29.239
And the illness was perhaps just the occasion to make that decision and maybe accelerate the decision.

17:29.940 --> 17:31.963
But you don't look to me to be an angry man.

17:32.043 --> 17:35.447
I mean, a lot of us thought this might have been Paul Tsongas' year.

17:35.782 --> 17:40.388
And I think it's kind of a spin-off of what Ted was asking when I came in.

17:40.408 --> 17:47.998
A lot of us thought, you know, this could have been your year to be on the debate last night and to have a date with Destiny next month.

17:48.279 --> 17:57.631
Do you think about this often enough at all, not often enough, but at all, that this could have been the year that you might have made the run for the big one?

17:57.811 --> 18:03.038
I don't think about it until I get the question so often that... You have to have an answer for it.

18:03.355 --> 18:13.924
Well, first of all, as I said earlier, I had decided before my run for re-election and the whole campus thing that I would have stayed one more term.

18:14.345 --> 18:15.706
We didn't like Washington.

18:16.567 --> 18:18.408
We didn't like the weekends away.

18:18.428 --> 18:20.530
We were concerned about the impact on the community.

18:21.491 --> 18:26.555
And at some point, you'd have to have normalcy if these kids were to have any chance.

18:27.656 --> 18:32.080
So my feeling was run for re-election in 1984.

18:32.633 --> 18:40.583
So running in 88 was part of the program, right?

18:40.603 --> 18:43.247
Yeah.

18:43.267 --> 18:57.124
And one day you wake up and they tell you you have cancer and it's never been—it's not a survivable form and becoming president doesn't stop anymore.

18:57.144 --> 18:58.346
You look marvelous.

18:59.788 --> 19:01.510
How are things going?

19:02.030 --> 19:13.261
You know, you're only as good as your last checkup, but I went through the bone marrow transplant two years ago, and it's apparently worked.

19:13.281 --> 19:14.442
Great.

19:14.682 --> 19:25.312
I remember when we spoke—pardon me for keep referring back, because it's a nice point of reference for me—you said then, I've got a few things to do yet in public life.

19:26.534 --> 19:31.058
When you first hung out your shingle in law, you said, I discovered I was a mediocre lawyer.

19:31.679 --> 19:36.225
You've been in private practice now for four years.

19:36.946 --> 19:37.506
How's it going?

19:38.187 --> 19:38.888
Professionally.

19:39.429 --> 19:43.494
Are you satisfied with your progress professionally, what you're doing?

19:43.514 --> 19:46.318
Well, I think I've done very well professionally.

19:46.338 --> 19:52.525
If I was a mediocre lawyer then— And I'm using your words, not mine.

19:52.545 --> 20:00.876
I am less than a mediocre lawyer now, and my partners and I have agreed that I will stay away from the courts and the library.

20:01.750 --> 20:03.052
I've never been to court.

20:03.112 --> 20:04.615
I never intend to go to court.

20:05.035 --> 20:13.209
And in four years I've been to the library, the law library at the firm once, and that was to work for a newspaper.

20:13.770 --> 20:16.535
So what specifically, what kind of law are you doing then?

20:17.075 --> 20:18.277
I'm not really doing law.

20:18.378 --> 20:27.032
I'm really involved in real estate projects like, you know, we've tried to visit Boston Garden.

20:28.126 --> 20:35.357
A lot of energy projects are involved in an attempt to build a pipeline from Alberta to the Northeast.

20:36.699 --> 20:41.847
We represent people like the Humane Society of the United States and the National Venture Capital.

20:42.949 --> 20:48.177
So it's really an issue-based law practice, not a law-based law practice.

20:49.827 --> 20:52.290
And I'm just using one of your quotes from the story.

20:52.430 --> 20:55.093
I want to go out on my terms, not someone else's.

20:55.113 --> 20:57.696
That seems to be not just a political decision.

20:59.138 --> 21:01.821
You seem to be guiding your life along that philosophy.

21:02.923 --> 21:04.344
Well, I don't want to be a Willie May.

21:04.364 --> 21:07.288
There you go.

21:07.308 --> 21:09.651
I remember that last game in the World Series.

21:09.671 --> 21:11.152
Isn't it terrible?

21:11.252 --> 21:16.278
Look at Sandy Koufax went out of the top of his game, and he's been honored ever since.

21:16.298 --> 21:17.039
Ted Williams.

21:17.059 --> 21:17.640
Ted Williams.

21:18.768 --> 21:22.672
These guys would hang on and hang on and the same thing is true in policy.

21:22.692 --> 21:26.997
Jimmy Brown, Rocky Marciano, sports.

21:27.017 --> 21:38.669
I'm sorry, but I remember I started that piece, one of your daughters came up to you and said, Daddy, do we have to live in the White House?

21:39.110 --> 21:44.235
It was a great quote because you never lost an election I don't think.

21:45.143 --> 21:51.291
And so he was just expected, I mean, from city council to county commissioner to Congress to the Senate.

21:51.791 --> 21:54.194
Next stop, 1600 Pennsylvania.

21:55.376 --> 22:03.286
I imagine the kids are quite happy that you're out of that—the family is pleased that you're out of that life.

22:03.646 --> 22:04.507
Yeah, they are.

22:05.308 --> 22:14.880
Though occasionally the older two will say, they wish you rad if they wanted to work in the campaign.

22:15.130 --> 22:44.344
so i i don't see any any is there any frustration for you though i mean not anger you certainly don't look like an angry man but when you see these issues of the day being tossed back and forth and i know you feel you have the highest respect for tukakis but is there frustration that it's not you out there swinging away and carrying the flag and

22:45.438 --> 22:46.880
No.

22:48.201 --> 22:49.583
You know, I go to Washington.

22:49.623 --> 22:53.026
This week I've been to Washington twice on business.

22:53.046 --> 23:00.454
And when I go, I don't, there's nothing, nothing clicks inside of me that says, I miss it.

23:00.695 --> 23:01.215
I miss it.

23:01.596 --> 23:08.463
And, you know, you can't, no one can have gone through what I've been through or not be affected by it.

23:08.483 --> 23:14.770
I mean, you really, you know, I think other things mean more to you than the glory and the long life.

23:15.104 --> 23:22.955
And I'm involved, as you know, in a number of the Cape Cod stuff and a lot of issues with the law firm.

23:23.015 --> 23:30.105
Plus, I serve on a number of boards that have university boards and things like that.

23:30.265 --> 23:32.528
So, I keep my finger in enough.

23:36.734 --> 23:43.744
Plus, as I said, I'm in Washington on occasion to still keep up my friendships.

23:44.585 --> 23:52.071
was in Austria this summer conducting seminars for Europeans on going back to Denmark next month.

23:52.352 --> 23:53.793
So a lot of that continues.

23:54.633 --> 23:57.876
But in terms of would I run this campaign differently?

23:57.916 --> 23:58.277
Sure.

23:59.037 --> 24:01.439
And we talked about it a lot.

24:02.340 --> 24:07.965
And I'm more of a centrist than most Democrats.

24:09.026 --> 24:14.170
But I think Michael has

24:15.010 --> 24:17.293
qualities that I don't have.

24:18.033 --> 24:20.136
And I think it's carried them a long way.

24:20.416 --> 24:23.159
Well, you've had an award-winning ad, Hey Tickets.

24:23.920 --> 24:28.685
Do you think Mike could have benefited from some kind of an advertising scheme like that?

24:31.989 --> 24:38.015
I don't fault Michael in the same way I don't credit Bush.

24:38.456 --> 24:44.022
His campaigns, to a large extent, are really strategies.

24:45.115 --> 24:51.345
And as we did on the ticket there, which everyone got credit to.

24:51.365 --> 24:52.687
I had nothing to do with it.

24:52.707 --> 24:53.288
It was great to go.

24:53.308 --> 24:54.089
It was the staff.

24:54.510 --> 25:01.020
And Bush had superb advisors, Jim Baker, people like that.

25:01.801 --> 25:03.764
And Michael did not.

25:03.884 --> 25:06.709
I mean, there are good people who are very bright.

25:06.929 --> 25:12.658
But if you've not been around the circuit, you don't have the touch.

25:12.993 --> 25:20.960
I mean, things would happen, and I would—it touches everything, and it's like basketball.

25:20.980 --> 25:34.573
Well, I remember when you were looking ahead to your 84 campaign, it was anticipated that the right and the moral majority and all the others were going to come in, and I think they had announced that you were a target.

25:34.593 --> 25:36.595
And I love the quote, I mean, you're a tough guy.

25:38.156 --> 25:42.240
This is a tough business, and you have to be willing to mix it up with them.

25:42.980 --> 25:50.107
You weren't going to let them push you around, and whatever charges might have been made, you would have answered.

25:50.808 --> 25:55.913
My piece is going to be coming out after the election, so this is kind of a vague thing that you can put on your recorder if you want.

25:55.953 --> 26:00.197
But do you think that Dupacus could have mixed it up a little more?

26:02.499 --> 26:06.143
I thought they did well to the convention, very well.

26:06.163 --> 26:08.985
And I thought the speech at the convention was absolutely superb.

26:09.005 --> 26:10.607
It was wonderful.

26:12.578 --> 26:18.166
But then it almost like it went into neutral.

26:19.788 --> 26:25.356
And Bush's advisors really did a good job.

26:25.376 --> 26:31.444
And what they did was they defined Michael, and you can't let that happen.

26:31.464 --> 26:33.667
You've got to define yourself.

26:33.687 --> 26:40.316
Because if your opponent defines you, it's not going to be pleasant, and it's not going to be complimentary.

26:40.336 --> 26:41.758
And that's what happened.

26:42.194 --> 27:06.741
It's really too bad because I know Michael and I consider myself a friend and have seen him up close and what I admire about him and what I respect about him has not really come through.

27:07.361 --> 27:10.665
It's been like last night.

27:14.729 --> 27:18.795
And I think it's really been bottled up.

27:19.416 --> 27:36.701
And I think the people around them are so issue-oriented, so professorial, so academic, that the feel of the game, the touch of the game, I don't think it was basically respected by that circle.

27:38.624 --> 27:44.112
And so the real person, I don't think, has really been understood.

27:44.480 --> 27:45.461
Are you optimistic?

27:45.582 --> 27:52.131
I mean, my piece is coming out after the election, but are you optimistic or pessimistic?

27:52.151 --> 27:54.915
I mean, we've got three weeks left.

27:54.935 --> 28:00.182
Well, I think that the chance they have is to focus on the economic issue.

28:00.202 --> 28:04.868
I mean, you cannot at this juncture talk about eight or nine different issues.

28:04.889 --> 28:06.311
People don't want to smorgas for it.

28:06.331 --> 28:08.954
You're going to have to give them a central thing.

28:08.994 --> 28:13.120
If I'm lucky, this is what's going to happen on economic issues.

28:13.673 --> 28:24.207
My preference is you do it on the deficit and the issue of foreign ownership, because that's what the deficit means.

28:24.347 --> 28:33.580
And I think if you can make people understand what the Reagan-Bush deficits mean to this country over the long term, I think you can win this stuff.

28:33.660 --> 28:38.386
If you don't do it, I think it's a long shot.

28:38.406 --> 28:40.389
I think you've already answered, do you miss politics?

28:40.409 --> 28:41.090
The answer is no.

28:41.170 --> 28:41.851
It's one word.

28:42.271 --> 28:43.613
You don't miss it, I guess.

28:44.437 --> 28:46.419
Well, I'm involved in it.

28:46.499 --> 28:57.008
I'm still, you know, I'm not totally outside the process, but— You don't foresee getting back—the reason I'm rushing these things is I know you've got time to—you don't foresee ever getting back in.

28:57.569 --> 28:57.949
It's gone.

28:58.129 --> 28:59.570
It's behind you.

28:59.590 --> 29:01.392
Well, you asked the question, why would I run for?

29:03.714 --> 29:08.138
Listen, John Quincy Adams left the presidency and went back to the House.

29:08.338 --> 29:09.759
Humphrey went back to the Senate.

29:09.779 --> 29:13.903
I mean, there are things that you could find some satisfaction in.

29:14.693 --> 29:16.776
If Mike's elected, maybe you'd like to be governor.

29:17.437 --> 29:18.479
Who knows?

29:18.499 --> 29:18.699
No.

29:18.919 --> 29:24.007
You know, a lot of it is, I mean, you've got to really want something.

29:24.027 --> 29:33.541
And if you've given us something like the Senate, I guess my view is that I want to go on to do different things.

29:34.001 --> 29:37.727
And, you know, I've learned a lot in these corporate boards.

29:37.827 --> 29:44.076
And I think I've become a lot more knowledgeable than I used to be about certain things.

29:44.748 --> 29:57.864
You once told me that you had to leave your ethnic roots in order to appreciate them, and I think I covered that in a previous story.

29:59.606 --> 30:06.635
Do you feel similarly, you could say the same thing about politics, to appreciate it more now that you're out of it?

30:09.037 --> 30:12.021
Maybe I'm stretching the comparison a little bit, I don't know.

30:12.963 --> 30:21.414
Well, one thing, I think if I were the senator after this experience I've been through, I would have been a better senator.

30:22.435 --> 30:28.904
I just think I've been shocked into doing the kind of thinking that most people don't do because they don't have to.

30:31.187 --> 30:39.017
And it's somewhat ironic that at a time when I probably would be better, I don't want to do it, and I'm not going to do it.

30:39.177 --> 30:41.620
So in essence, I don't think I appreciate it more

30:42.241 --> 30:55.816
After the fact, I have a sense that, well, I suppose in a way you're right, that I have a greater sense now of appreciation for the responsibility.

30:56.316 --> 31:08.029
And I think the book that I did really means a lot to me, because it tried to break through some of the, you know, do things for political reasons.

31:13.679 --> 31:24.280
not um yeah i wouldn't
