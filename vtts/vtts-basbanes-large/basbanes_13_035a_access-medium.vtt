WEBVTT

00:01.600 --> 00:20.639
I wanted to go first because I thought my little presentation might become a prelude to the others in this way.

00:20.659 --> 00:23.602
And here we are asserting the pleasures of reading.

00:24.363 --> 00:29.228
And the fact that we have such a panel suggests

00:30.558 --> 00:35.625
Perhaps, for many of our countrymen, it is no great pleasure to read.

00:36.146 --> 00:46.661
I don't want to tell you that 60% of American households go year after year without ever buying a book, any book, a self-help book, or a book book.

00:47.682 --> 00:56.896
It's also the most secret in New York that this fall has been a difficult time for publishing a mysterious book.

00:58.578 --> 00:59.940
It is questionable whether

01:00.173 --> 01:09.022
Reading will occupy a central place in the lives of our children and college students.

01:09.042 --> 01:29.742
One thing I noticed, 1991, 92, when I was back in Columbia, compared to my own class, a freshman, 30 years earlier, was that these undergraduates, smart as they were, were generally, with some dad's own exception, non-obsessive readers.

01:30.667 --> 01:37.336
They did not have a kind of tiny intellectual obsession that I remembered from the early 60s.

01:37.356 --> 01:40.741
They may become obsessed to read with the purpose of this.

01:41.041 --> 01:56.843
These two courses, in part, is to get them over the hump of difficulty and begins to really enjoy some of these broad, formidable works so that such that reading becomes the center of their inner life.

01:57.886 --> 02:15.107
Now, I can speak with a certain authority of this danger of losing the pleasure of reading because I was in a rather poor state myself six or seven years ago and this thing began to generate.

02:15.588 --> 02:20.473
So I appeared to you somewhat in the form of a redeemed sinner.

02:22.115 --> 02:24.618
The book I saw in the following way.

02:24.779 --> 02:25.860
It was in 1989, 1991.

02:25.960 --> 02:27.522
I remember exactly.

02:27.907 --> 02:43.306
and myself were reading various texts of the culture wars, this debate about the significance of the Western tradition and what I'm going to be right here.

02:43.427 --> 02:49.354
And finding the whole affair very unsatisfactory.

02:49.374 --> 02:52.598
Because on the left you had people saying that

02:54.265 --> 03:03.293
books of the Western tradition and representative list, and I'll just tell you that empowered white males and disempowered everyone else.

03:03.313 --> 03:22.450
On the right, we had people like Secretary Bennett and Shaney and other generalists in the conservative community speaking of these books as if they were part of the national armature, or Star Wars, part of the national defense, which would repel

03:23.206 --> 03:29.456
communism, or fundamentalism, or whatever else it was that threatened the republic.

03:30.077 --> 03:32.260
And Kat and I were like, well, what in the world?

03:32.400 --> 03:38.650
But then you just have to do a reading Plato, Aristotle, Hegel, Recon, Marx, or Shakespeare, anyone, if you care to mention.

03:40.032 --> 03:43.137
So I complained.

03:43.157 --> 03:47.644
My dad is in the living room, and finally Kat, you know, says,

03:48.299 --> 03:49.881
The guy can't bear this anymore.

03:50.221 --> 03:51.523
Why can't you go back to school?

03:51.983 --> 03:53.445
The comedy's on a couple of miles away.

03:53.746 --> 03:55.207
You took those two courses.

03:56.249 --> 03:59.953
One, a literature course, starts with Humbert.

04:00.514 --> 04:03.958
And in those days, Andrew Duff, yes, he now is Virginia Woolf.

04:05.139 --> 04:07.282
He has a considerable shift in history.

04:07.302 --> 04:15.993
And the other, finally, a social theory course, if you have a place to be public, then go right up to the present.

04:16.153 --> 04:17.935
She says, go back and take that again.

04:18.607 --> 04:48.462
if we thought it might be a 95,000 word piece in the Atlantic monster so it's now five years later in a 200,000 word book and the reason of course is that I had open an obsession that was much larger for me personally than the outcome of a culture war and let me just try to

04:49.589 --> 04:54.115
say that I love writing film criticism.

04:54.135 --> 05:00.102
I love being a member of this chuggernaut about media.

05:00.623 --> 05:02.926
I also hate it.

05:02.946 --> 05:07.512
I'm in a state of complete ambivalence about it all the time.

05:08.313 --> 05:10.315
And what I felt, I think,

05:10.987 --> 05:15.312
as well as the desire to enter the culture wars in the ground up by actually reading.

05:15.332 --> 05:18.255
I was even close to saying what they might mean to an individual reader.

05:18.775 --> 05:36.515
But I felt back there five, six years ago, there was some sort of law that I, my head was filled with representations and images and simulacra, this thick atmosphere that surrounded all of us living in the media society, the atmosphere of second handedness.

05:37.836 --> 05:40.639
And that I felt in some way

05:41.075 --> 06:10.018
lost myself, that no one quite knew who I was, what was my opinion, I had opinions, I'm paid for him, but no beliefs, no attitudes, but no principles, and that I in some way lost my identity, and that possibly reading seriously would force the question of identity again.

06:10.707 --> 06:23.343
And by identity, I do not mean it in the way that is now primarily described the trinity of race, class, gender, which has been the academic recession in humanity for the last 20 years.

06:23.923 --> 06:25.926
I meant more like this.

06:26.667 --> 06:27.408
Who are you?

06:27.448 --> 06:28.849
Where do you come from?

06:28.930 --> 06:30.451
What do you inherit from the past?

06:30.511 --> 06:31.753
What do you take from the past?

06:32.594 --> 06:34.176
What are you willing to die for?

06:35.478 --> 06:36.699
What do you live for?

06:36.719 --> 06:37.440
What are you willing to die for?

06:38.332 --> 06:46.883
what do you want to give to the next generation of actors.

06:47.084 --> 06:55.635
So, I entered 91 informally.

06:55.895 --> 06:57.097
I didn't actually enroll.

06:57.117 --> 07:06.870
I thought I would sit there quietly taking notes that if they tell you a general school, don't make yourself the center of the story.

07:07.340 --> 07:11.184
But I found out I was completely irreversible.

07:11.544 --> 07:14.587
I didn't know.

07:14.607 --> 07:16.409
The courses are quite a piling session.

07:16.489 --> 07:17.450
They're not electric courses.

07:17.530 --> 07:18.551
This is their glory.

07:19.092 --> 07:25.438
The seminars are going to make people think on their feet so they can learn how to frame an argument.

07:26.059 --> 07:28.281
I watched them reading that.

07:28.301 --> 07:29.342
I watched myself.

07:30.223 --> 07:36.790
And I found out I had to trust myself and the book was trying to have an event to be something

07:37.360 --> 07:43.186
It goes chapter after each of the major writers that I choose to write about.

07:43.206 --> 07:43.727
I don't use all of them.

07:44.688 --> 07:47.431
But it's something of an autobiography as well.

07:47.631 --> 07:52.596
In other words, there was no way of keeping myself out of it, particularly because I am an amateur.

07:52.616 --> 07:57.902
I did not speak in the impersonal voice of a great scholar, of a great literary critic.

07:57.922 --> 08:05.530
I thought I needed to connect my life and also that I would read it.

08:05.750 --> 08:07.232
So what I've written is

08:07.668 --> 08:12.454
It's a kind of old-fashioned novel.

08:13.395 --> 08:32.799
There were these novels in the 19th century known as Bildungsroman, in which typically with David Popper, young men from the provinces, unformed, would come into the metropolis and undergo certain kind of testing and formative experiences in that year's rise or same.

08:33.760 --> 08:35.262
The red and the black, that's no good.

08:35.680 --> 08:41.846
What I've written is a kind of film in reverse.

08:41.866 --> 08:53.578
And then the middle-aged man goes from the metropolitan center to downtown magazine offices, where the talk is fast and slick and perhaps not all that interesting.

08:53.718 --> 09:05.670
Finally, back to the problems is that the morning side lights uptown in Columbia, where the talk is slower and braver and more serious and, in the end, far more interesting.

09:06.106 --> 09:17.882
I sat there in a kind of state of humiliation all year long.

09:17.902 --> 09:19.264
I can tell you.

09:19.284 --> 09:23.771
This is the greatest experience of my birth.

09:23.791 --> 09:24.912
My children forgot me.

09:24.932 --> 09:29.118
This is the greatest experience of my run of life.

09:29.138 --> 09:34.105
And I think this is not an irrelevant comparison because I know a child was born

09:34.456 --> 09:40.645
On this page, in England, I was having to tie myself down.

09:40.865 --> 09:51.401
Now, it was excruciating and difficult in the practical sense, as well as spiritual, psychological, to find the time to read.

09:51.621 --> 10:02.337
I did continue working, not only because I needed income, but because I wanted to see how

10:03.076 --> 10:08.406
You very well just get into, you quote, normal, normal busy life.

10:08.967 --> 10:10.490
I read it whenever I could.

10:10.510 --> 10:12.995
I read it late at night at home.

10:13.236 --> 10:15.520
I read it when the children were taking a bath.

10:16.181 --> 10:21.472
I read it standing up in the New York subway surrounded by people reading John Grisham.

10:21.492 --> 10:24.257
I was standing there holding Play-Doh.

10:25.115 --> 10:27.838
You can't read Plato in this way, aren't we?

10:27.858 --> 10:31.022
Because she knows very well.

10:31.082 --> 10:39.431
Because click clicking on the wheels on the rails pushes the man just plopped along with Thatcher and they're already moving.

10:40.392 --> 10:52.585
A man reading alone in an American home is not a person to be respected, I discovered.

10:53.807 --> 10:54.868
I would chase

10:55.574 --> 11:01.284
from study, the children would not come and find, they were reactive to the house.

11:02.586 --> 11:11.501
They'd go, I was chased from study to kitchen to bedroom to nanny's room where I would sit there.

11:11.521 --> 11:20.637
I would teach silk undergarments of hanging down over your knees, saying the cousin's confession, like an adulterous husband.

11:25.679 --> 11:28.863
And there were many successes and many failures.

11:28.883 --> 11:35.372
And I wanted to write this book as candidly as possible and make engagement as clear as possible.

11:35.392 --> 11:36.673
It's not being able to play for me.

11:36.693 --> 11:38.175
I can't even write about it.

11:38.195 --> 11:45.324
But I also wrote about things where I admit a difficulty with the gap, which was very great.

11:45.425 --> 11:48.308
For instance, a meeting about the Inferno.

11:48.328 --> 11:52.093
This is before the Robert Pincus translation came out.

11:52.113 --> 11:53.475
We had a translation which

11:53.978 --> 12:02.953
did not catch fire for me, and I felt that the climax was stuck with a doctrinal rather than a poetic reading of the text.

12:04.455 --> 12:11.908
And there was a moment of magic when one of the students was in the county began, we'd go to a canto, and everyone felt silent.

12:11.928 --> 12:13.290
I don't know, this is too corny.

12:13.310 --> 12:15.935
You can't be happy to do something in a movie.

12:16.415 --> 12:20.442
But it did happen, and we were awed by the beauty about this.

12:20.894 --> 12:28.802
and I would say almost be struck by how much we were missing the combination of sound and sense.

12:30.043 --> 12:35.248
Getting almost sense was not an adequate being of the inferno.

12:35.268 --> 12:43.396
In other cases, though, in Lattimore's concession to Homer, I find completely exhilarating.

12:45.278 --> 12:47.340
There were breakthroughs of a personal agent.

12:47.793 --> 12:55.746
Complication, which I discovered was why I knew, but I just found my discovery was not what it was when I was 15 or 16.

12:55.826 --> 12:59.111
I used to sit on bed in my parents' apartment and go read for hours.

12:59.873 --> 13:02.918
If you have a look, I'll go do two hours more later.

13:03.879 --> 13:05.442
There's a quilt that grandma knitted.

13:05.582 --> 13:08.647
Okay, this is red, red, green, red.

13:09.889 --> 13:11.171
All right, back to the book.

13:12.874 --> 13:14.897
Now, I'm sorry to say,

13:15.029 --> 13:31.808
or at least five or six years ago, I was bound up out of my seat after 25 or 30 minutes and rushed to turn on CNN or make a telephone call or return messages.

13:31.888 --> 13:40.378
I don't know whether this is an onset of a middle-aged attention deficit disorder or just a more active life sending up

13:42.046 --> 13:51.582
imps of destruction from my unconscious, which would sort of engage the text that I was reading and send me off into daydreaming.

13:53.024 --> 13:59.034
I began to accept daydreaming as the year went on as a kind of commentary on the text.

13:59.054 --> 14:08.830
I decided it was not entirely worthless that daydreaming was something a writer should be to feel as if it was a resource of fantasy.

14:09.164 --> 14:20.018
of any kind, even if it's self-regarding as you were what daydreaming is, has some sort of commandment of use that you grab

14:21.365 --> 14:32.136
There were moments of defeat with the German philosophers, and Hegel, whose language is about as far from every day of American speech as you can get.

14:32.156 --> 14:42.306
And I remember throwing a number of volumes across the room and aiming at one of the cushions on the chair on the other side of the living room, and then really picking the book out again.

14:42.326 --> 14:48.773
And I'll tell you my breakthrough on meeting Hegel, because after the philosophy, it just became an exciting to be in the latter.

14:48.753 --> 14:50.695
And it's very difficult to do with any book.

14:50.715 --> 14:57.062
If you feel that you should like this and you're not, I suggest reading it aloud.

14:57.082 --> 15:02.809
There's something hard for Americans to do, I think, because many of us are not trying to read aloud in school.

15:02.949 --> 15:03.970
There's something that's lost.

15:04.711 --> 15:07.454
And so we're embarrassed about it.

15:07.674 --> 15:13.661
And my own students when they read aloud in the beginning of the year, it was a freshman, partially.

15:14.441 --> 15:15.823
Read as if they were reading

15:17.002 --> 15:21.968
computer manual, you know, just getting through the words.

15:22.649 --> 15:25.011
By the end of the year, they were beginning to the conference.

15:25.031 --> 15:28.155
They started to be combat-like in the last five-part of darkness.

15:29.036 --> 15:34.623
It's fantastically right, you know, comradies, those things, and they came to life.

15:34.643 --> 15:35.904
But a lot of them are very self-conscious.

15:35.924 --> 15:39.849
They're afraid that, by reading the expression, they're getting away from it.

15:39.869 --> 15:45.135
But if you read something recalcitrant aloud of

15:46.229 --> 15:47.931
You hear it in a different way.

15:47.971 --> 15:50.495
You hear it as an audience.

15:51.056 --> 16:01.190
Hagel's introduction of the philosophy, which is one of the number of texts that were actually not fully written out, but were lecturing out at the University of Orlando when he died.

16:02.231 --> 16:09.561
And his colleagues, students, assembled these numbers of his labor works from those.

16:09.661 --> 16:11.764
So he meant to be read a lot, but he meant

16:12.149 --> 16:30.445
And when I declaimed him against the sound of traffic on West End Avenue at one o'clock in the morning, and it all seemed to have a kind of incansatory splendor, and suddenly the meaning became a great deal clearer.

16:31.032 --> 16:33.835
There is no plot here at the beginning.

16:33.855 --> 16:48.170
Our hero cannot remember anything, and cannot concentrate, doesn't remember the Iliad in the Odyssey, which he read 30 years earlier, doesn't remember one guy himself, even.

16:49.091 --> 17:00.583
And as I read through these two courses through the year, I've been to encounter memories which first come in a far provisional

17:00.850 --> 17:04.794
fragmentary way, and then become flooding.

17:05.455 --> 17:17.106
And by the end, what we get to Virginia Woolf, who blind us, and also a wonderful little boat-a-room on dome, memories are flooding in.

17:17.327 --> 17:30.520
And the leader has obtained something like self possession, or at least a way of taking hold of himself after all these years.

17:30.787 --> 17:41.701
And to announce that what I've had, I suppose, is a kind of therapeutic experience, but I'm thankful I've found that for a take.

17:42.181 --> 17:47.828
But I hardly mean to suggest that these books aren't useful only for self-discovery.

17:47.848 --> 17:51.813
They are extraordinarily powerful in a variety of ways.

17:51.893 --> 17:59.022
I've only given you a fraction here of the kind of meanings I look for.

17:59.626 --> 18:03.012
I'm not upset by the notion of it as a self-help book.

18:03.172 --> 18:07.781
Only, let's say, 1,000 steps other than 12.

18:08.222 --> 18:14.513
Education being incremental and self-knowledge is something you'd like for one sentence.

18:31.418 --> 18:41.492
Our next reader is Blaine Schwartz, who grew up in Brooklyn and claims to have been ruined by me.

18:41.512 --> 18:43.094
The title of her famous book.

18:44.216 --> 18:55.131
At age three, she was discovered in her mother's kitchen reading the label on a diamond crystal kosher coarse salt box.

18:56.545 --> 19:00.411
This event marked her as the family prodigy.

19:02.273 --> 19:08.202
The Mozartist words were then encouraged to compose but also to perform.

19:09.684 --> 19:16.134
She was to read the New York Times aloud for guests.

19:16.214 --> 19:22.283
Lynn claimed though that reading was the ticket and that that entitled her to her faith in the world.

19:22.482 --> 19:30.276
She got so high on the sensual and emotional pleasures of reading that it became a lifelong addiction.

19:31.018 --> 19:45.925
And contrary to the ancient maxim that no girl was ever ruined by a good book, Schwarz submits herself as a vivid egg and blissfully says, it's good to be ruined in this way.

19:47.947 --> 20:10.832
Despite the severity of her condition, she became a useful and productive citizen, turning her own words with high critical regards to her novel, including Leaving Brooklyn, Discernances in the Field, and more recently, The Fatigue Guard was drawn from her experience with chronic fatigue syndrome.

20:11.504 --> 20:12.565
Please welcome Ms.

20:12.726 --> 20:27.684
Survival of Irreversible Hate, of Compulsive Reading Disorder and Choice.

20:27.704 --> 20:27.824
Hello.

20:27.844 --> 20:38.878
It's been a special pleasure to be on this panel because I can be sure that anybody who comes to hear us really is prepared and wants to be here.

20:39.247 --> 20:43.933
Well, I was going to say what Jean said about me.

20:43.953 --> 20:47.657
If David Demme is a reformed sinner, I'm an underrepresented addict.

20:48.018 --> 20:49.820
I'm not letting it be in recovery.

20:50.981 --> 20:57.950
I have to read at least two hours a day.

20:57.970 --> 21:06.300
It doesn't matter what area I do, I just have to be in that act because my eyes move across a line of print.

21:06.601 --> 21:12.815
I try to organize things so that I can do this, even if it's late in the evening.

21:13.076 --> 21:19.691
I know it's been very late, but even if I'm out and doing things, I can always read for a couple of hours for one or two.

21:19.711 --> 21:20.914
But if I don't,

21:21.063 --> 21:25.229
I find I'll get up at 4 or 5 in the morning, I just can't sleep.

21:25.730 --> 21:26.591
I have this need.

21:26.611 --> 21:29.596
Well, some people have to go to the refrigerator at 5 in the morning.

21:30.036 --> 21:34.883
Well, I know that I just have to sit down with a book or newspaper at that hour.

21:35.284 --> 21:41.153
If it says 4 or 5 in the morning, I try to read something dull, sort of getting back to sleep.

21:41.273 --> 21:45.058
I won't mention what's dull, but it's embarrassing.

21:45.078 --> 21:46.260
Usually, you get a certain...

21:46.443 --> 21:50.767
periodicals that even always rely on.

21:50.787 --> 21:58.254
Although, as I say in the book, you may start to read something that you think is going to result and it turns out to be fascinating.

21:58.634 --> 22:02.998
They have old issues of, you know, natural history and things like that around the country.

22:03.018 --> 22:04.319
And then they're wonderful.

22:05.100 --> 22:07.422
And it doesn't depend on the content.

22:07.683 --> 22:13.648
It depends on the voice and the degree of life and energy in the sentences.

22:15.738 --> 22:22.285
Ruined by reading, which I, too, thought was an ancient adage, but it did not.

22:23.086 --> 22:42.969
I found that out from, I was giving a reading from this book, and I started looking at how I got the title, and somebody came up at the end and reminded me that it was first spoken by New York's Mayor Jimmy Walker, very common voice mayor, in the 30s.

22:42.989 --> 22:44.310
During a censorship case,

22:44.662 --> 22:47.825
And he said, no girl was ever ruined by a book.

22:48.746 --> 22:52.751
And this is a very physical image.

22:53.391 --> 23:05.845
So that when the copy editors spoke in the interest of, what do we call it, gender, free, whatever, to try to change it to no person was ever ruined by a book.

23:06.065 --> 23:06.465
It was wrong.

23:07.426 --> 23:09.468
There were many things they tried to change.

23:10.329 --> 23:12.812
I wrote somewhere that I generally enjoyed the

23:13.670 --> 23:17.375
Housewives of the Arts, and they try to make it domestic.

23:18.036 --> 23:28.891
And I thought that ball players, and they try to... well, there's no male things, anyway.

23:29.392 --> 23:36.783
You see, the whole point is supposed to be digressive, and I'm going to read it.

23:36.803 --> 23:38.245
I'll play how I wrote it.

23:38.265 --> 23:39.947
I was in a state of despair

23:40.045 --> 23:43.109
That's how I write most books.

23:43.129 --> 23:46.934
But usually I just never remember that I had ever been there before.

23:47.875 --> 23:49.597
I thought I didn't know anything.

23:49.617 --> 23:58.168
You know, novelists have this problem that non-fiction writers don't, that if we don't really know anything, we should know other books.

23:58.849 --> 24:02.814
So I didn't have to feel that I could turn to them, but I had written everything I knew.

24:03.755 --> 24:06.238
And what would I write next?

24:06.472 --> 24:11.644
asking about, I said, well, I do know about reading, I'll write about that.

24:11.664 --> 24:25.054
It's a long essay, and I put in everything that I knew about reading, and through and through and through, the way you're recording, you can always have new parts and folds.

24:25.405 --> 24:27.469
I didn't think of it as a memoir.

24:27.489 --> 24:32.097
It was a book about reading, and I viewed my life under the aspects of reading.

24:32.638 --> 24:38.929
So the reading sort of became an organizing principle after a while, or whatever thoughts I was having at the time.

24:39.410 --> 24:41.153
So the book itself is a

24:41.723 --> 24:43.808
an experiment, a certain looping.

24:43.828 --> 24:45.352
It takes a looping path.

24:45.612 --> 24:46.554
It's always about reading.

24:46.895 --> 24:51.406
But I want you to know how far I can go away from the path and my experience to it.

24:51.426 --> 24:58.703
I think of it as if anything has ever been a yo-yo champion as I was.

24:59.172 --> 25:02.136
You know, you can do this around the world.

25:02.156 --> 25:15.734
The third day, they were very far out, and it was like a elder gave back, but you know that you have a strange thing, or you're in control, and that's part of the past of the book.

25:15.754 --> 25:23.965
Well, I thought I won't talk anymore about it, because I don't like the talks, because everything I say that's worth saying, I get written down.

25:24.434 --> 25:28.962
So I'm going to read them, read those parts.

25:30.344 --> 25:42.726
And I'll start with a couple of pages at the opening that will give you an idea of what the book is doing and how I feel about reading.

25:43.688 --> 25:47.775
Rarely did the daily paper move me to reach out in my life.

25:48.093 --> 25:56.095
But a recent New York Times sees older Chinese scholars, quote, illegal Buddhism has purged its appetite for folks.

25:56.564 --> 26:00.208
Mr. Chow says, to read more is a handicap.

26:00.749 --> 26:07.436
It is better to keep your own mind free and to not let the thinking of others interfere with your own free thinking.

26:08.337 --> 26:16.246
I clicked this statement and placed it on the bedside table next to a pile of books I was reading or planned to read or thought I'd love to read.

26:16.946 --> 26:20.010
The clipping is about two square inches and almost weightless.

26:20.610 --> 26:24.715
The pile of books come nine inches high, weighing a few pounds.

26:25.201 --> 26:27.646
Yet they face each other in perfect balance.

26:28.528 --> 26:30.472
I am the scale on which they rest.

26:31.775 --> 26:35.202
Lying in the shadow of the books, I have written on my reading habits.

26:35.803 --> 26:36.826
What is it all about?

26:37.327 --> 26:38.609
What am I doing this for?

26:39.070 --> 26:43.159
And the classic addicts question, what is it doing for me?

26:43.814 --> 26:47.581
Mr. Chow's serenity and independent mind of an entry book.

26:48.062 --> 26:57.902
I would like to be fully independent, but I'm not sure my mind could be free without reading, or that the action books have on it is properly termed interference.

26:58.864 --> 27:03.713
I suspect the interaction with the mind and the book is something more complex.

27:03.878 --> 27:05.960
Well, this is really what I want to write about.

27:06.521 --> 27:14.089
I can see it encompassing an intimate history in geography, the evolution of character, the shifting map of personal taste.

27:14.870 --> 27:19.735
And what about the use of the language itself, as well as the perennial lure of narratives?

27:20.876 --> 27:25.601
But perhaps passing an issue in such large terms only shows how enslaved I am.

27:26.402 --> 27:32.248
Putting aside, there is no readers in arguments so far to help curb this appetite.

27:33.055 --> 27:39.485
There's a couple of sentences I just read about shifting out of personal taste and the history of the occupiers.

27:40.006 --> 27:41.849
I kind of lied.

27:41.869 --> 27:42.851
They weren't in there.

27:43.051 --> 27:44.974
This is a little note I don't want to get written.

27:45.295 --> 27:49.782
They were not in there when I presented this manuscript, which means that I had never

27:50.099 --> 27:56.225
about reading a book that somebody had read an essay about that I had written on this analogy to expand it.

27:56.766 --> 28:03.432
And his editor said, well, why don't you think that somewhere in the beginning you want to say what this book is really about, if you read your clue.

28:03.452 --> 28:06.195
I'm going to be honest.

28:06.936 --> 28:08.337
That would be a good idea.

28:08.517 --> 28:12.701
And so I made it because you sent it to death and the whole thing was written.

28:12.721 --> 28:17.406
You see, sometimes these things just flowed out that way, but it's not the case.

28:19.124 --> 28:20.405
I'm skipping ahead.

28:20.986 --> 28:25.991
I read at an early age, three and a half, the girl upstairs taught me.

28:26.011 --> 28:37.123
Late afternoons, we spent the blackboard in her hallway, and sheets of signs that were the same, but in an uncensored costume, as the words that came from our lips.

28:37.223 --> 28:48.135
Once I grasp the principle of conversion, the airy puffs of voice become a visual counterpart, the rest, what teachers call breaking the code, was routine.

28:48.470 --> 28:51.052
The world existed to be read, and I did.

28:51.953 --> 28:59.360
Diamond crystal kosher coarse salt on a cylindrical container my mother shook over simmering pots, and red U.S.

28:59.500 --> 29:09.790
hat off on every box in a can, as the rhythms of the pounding verses of the bigger girls chanted out on the street, twirling their jumpers.

29:09.810 --> 29:14.815
Before I knew who I was and what I might be, I became the prodigy, the reader.

29:15.183 --> 29:21.465
When Frank visited, my father was sung to me in happy New York Times, his finger aimed at the lead story.

29:21.505 --> 29:22.830
Read that.

29:23.633 --> 29:26.543
I read, though those signs had no meaning.

29:26.928 --> 29:33.657
Sometimes the guests refused to be convinced, suspecting I had been coached by the big winners on any of the quiz shows.

29:34.037 --> 29:39.344
I think my wife would also assume it would be a major question.

29:39.365 --> 29:40.346
I only had a great question.

29:40.366 --> 29:44.071
So my father would invite them to test me with any article on any page.

29:44.591 --> 29:47.375
No four-year-old could have memorized the entire paper.

29:48.477 --> 29:56.327
And while they marveled at my previous achievement, which seemed to exist apart from my physical being, I could return to my paper dolls.

29:56.847 --> 30:03.236
It's my usefulness and value that my parents laid his powers to amaze, then I have to keep doing it.

30:03.256 --> 30:06.240
Reading was the ticket that entitled me to my place in the world.

30:06.821 --> 30:08.683
But in school there were other bright children.

30:09.244 --> 30:11.147
Soon everyone would agree.

30:11.167 --> 30:18.056
My ticket was fraying, sadly devalued, and I felt certainly my botanic Samson most felt shorn.

30:18.076 --> 30:20.880
What can you do once we are ordinary?

30:21.601 --> 30:23.884
The dress of hair for Samson's strength

30:24.151 --> 30:27.156
It's not as arbitrary or peculiar as I once thought.

30:27.837 --> 30:34.869
If your identity rests in special powers, you shiver without them, naked to the wind, moving to the back of your neck.

30:34.889 --> 30:44.324
It was too late to fashion another ticket, and beside I didn't have means, irresistible charm or beauty or athletic prowess of a saint's weakness.

30:45.366 --> 30:50.074
Could I just be here of no special use at all, simply by having been born?

30:50.982 --> 30:56.892
I envy my blind peers to just make you think I still do.

30:56.912 --> 31:01.921
When I stand on the platform and speak, I envy the audience who may only listen.

31:02.802 --> 31:09.354
My father's ghost is that my shoulder is gazed not on me, but on the guests.

31:09.394 --> 31:14.222
With a swift jerk in the head, he chuckles and says, just get a load of this.

31:15.839 --> 31:24.332
Because I read in our facilities even magic, reading was magical, not merely breaking the code or translating one set of symbols into another.

31:24.692 --> 31:28.618
The idea of translatability was itself magical and so pertains.

31:29.579 --> 31:35.308
Semiotics, before it became a full-on branch of study, was the slave kind of wave of the world.

31:36.229 --> 31:43.500
Signs and things, things and signs, layered, sometimes jumbled partners in advance of illusion.

31:44.459 --> 31:58.832
I was reading from this book, I read in Washington, and I was managing over at the end to identify himself as a psychoanalyst, and he asked me if I was aware of the depths of anger I asked my father, who made me breathe when I was three.

31:58.852 --> 32:02.215
And I have other things here about my father.

32:02.495 --> 32:06.539
My buddy sent me out, I said, I've read the books to Houston.

32:06.559 --> 32:11.884
When I was seven, he was reading me 26 cents and asked me to go to the corner and buy a cigar, Corona, Corona.

32:11.904 --> 32:14.466
He said, I don't see you yet anymore, maybe here you can.

32:14.750 --> 32:20.298
So, anyway, this man wanted to know if I was aware.

32:20.318 --> 32:29.492
I thought I was aware, but, you know, under the circumstances of the book, it seemed that terrible, but he left me looking worried.

32:35.100 --> 32:41.449
My parents, when he looked at the book, I used this phrase, ironically, in a little motif to open several sessions.

32:42.020 --> 32:45.064
My parents were people of the book, but I did not appreciate this.

32:45.504 --> 32:54.776
And as I started college and acquired Tim Senn's literary history, I indulged the analysts in me to reshape them to make them fit my ideal.

32:55.677 --> 32:56.679
I was 16.

32:57.359 --> 33:03.387
In the last gasp of identification with parents, which is often the first gasp of separation,

33:03.518 --> 33:19.662
I want them to share in the great discovery I was marveling at, that there was literary history, that the whole fortress landscape I had been flipping through at random, pausing here and there to sniff or taste or swallow, had an order like a vast English garden.

33:20.643 --> 33:30.538
There were maps shown in paths and byways, replete with measurements and arrows, longitude and latitudes, charts of the distances and relations between points,

33:33.134 --> 33:47.254
I hadn't been so excited by the idea of scope and breadth since my first day of junior high school when the Western history teacher announced that there was another called the Red Song in 15th century Italy and listed its features on the blackboard.

33:47.915 --> 33:49.877
I had never heard of the Red Song before.

33:50.338 --> 33:55.525
Even the word Red Song was exulting, as was its companion for humanism.

33:56.847 --> 34:01.774
I was a humanist too, I decided that very day, and let school transform.

34:02.800 --> 34:07.411
That's how I describe how I have to reform my parents.

34:07.431 --> 34:10.860
I pressed books on them, cajoling my humanity and proving to be moved to power.

34:11.341 --> 34:19.020
Though they didn't often read what I urged, they took the suggestions docilely, never challenging my campaign to educate them.

34:19.439 --> 34:21.823
I had my greatest success with the tribe.

34:22.524 --> 34:28.734
It was not hard to get my father interested to fit marginally into his preferred category of political books.

34:29.455 --> 34:34.603
Also, he was a lawyer and the title promised legal proceedings.

34:34.823 --> 34:40.232
I was spending the 4th July week and blissfully alone at home while my parents were in the country.

34:40.212 --> 34:44.316
The same old country they had gone to every summer for as long as I could remember.

34:44.857 --> 34:49.481
My father was part of a great caravan of men driving out for the country world weekends.

34:51.183 --> 34:52.464
So I was home alone.

34:52.484 --> 34:57.209
But I loved best for the weekends when he disappeared and I could pretend I was living on my own.

34:57.990 --> 35:01.573
On one of those happy evenings, I received a long-distance call.

35:02.594 --> 35:09.561
That will be recommended, my father began with his customary of brokenness, by that Kafka, the tribe,

35:09.862 --> 35:11.744
Yes, I said equally, did you read it?

35:12.565 --> 35:13.846
Well, that's what I'm calling about.

35:14.347 --> 35:18.771
Your mother and I both read it, and we have a very different opinion on what it means.

35:18.791 --> 35:25.939
I say it's about the injustices of the legal system in the modern state, how you can get lost in the bureaucracy and rent tape and so on.

35:26.500 --> 35:34.468
And she says, it's just about life itself, how you're always guilty about something or other, and you think you deserve to be kind of silly for being a lie.

35:35.123 --> 35:36.124
He paused.

35:36.725 --> 35:38.347
My heart bleached.

35:38.367 --> 35:39.629
This was exactly what I wanted.

35:40.129 --> 35:42.813
We should theorize this way every waking hour.

35:44.415 --> 35:46.577
So, he said, what do you think?

35:47.659 --> 35:52.384
My years of reading have brought forth fruit.

35:52.404 --> 35:54.928
I was an acknowledged expert on what things meant.

35:54.948 --> 35:59.493
Well, actually, I said in a cool, patronizing matter, I've been picked up for my professors.

35:59.934 --> 36:00.895
You're both right.

36:02.292 --> 36:05.135
Those interpretations aren't mutually exclusive.

36:05.696 --> 36:11.183
The beauty of the book is that it can encompass so many appointments simultaneously.

36:11.203 --> 36:12.344
My father was disappointed.

36:13.325 --> 36:17.230
He liked having things one way or the other, and he liked to be right.

36:18.332 --> 36:26.882
He had probably been counting on me, for I usually supported his tough-minded, as opposed to my mother's more humane, but a less sturdy formulation.

36:27.385 --> 36:35.295
He argued this case for a while, then my mother got on the phone and pleaded hers, but I steadfastly refused to choose one over the other.

36:35.936 --> 36:41.202
They must have come out the best, but I was delighted, envisioning the future transformed.

36:41.943 --> 36:47.290
I would read them through all the Western list as I was being led, only a few steps ahead.

36:47.310 --> 36:50.254
This never came to pass.

36:50.274 --> 36:53.578
In the fall I rented a room near school and began growing up.

36:53.795 --> 36:55.939
My life was no longer centered on home.

36:56.540 --> 36:59.325
What in my parents' grades didn't read stopped mattering.

36:59.967 --> 37:01.610
I had to learn to cook for myself.

37:02.251 --> 37:04.716
I asked my mother about how she'd never taught me to cook.

37:05.657 --> 37:15.516
I started reading, well, now I'm referring to the early person's book, I was going to be known as cooking influence, which is quite the comic.

37:15.850 --> 37:25.080
As I read to me in her meat grinder, all I knew was grilled cheese sandwiches and cocoa, and I was getting a tomato sauce, tomato and onion sauce, and I was cooking during her life.

37:25.881 --> 37:30.887
Why did she never train me in the various tasks of the arts, over which I had had such scorn?

37:31.768 --> 37:37.634
She replied that I was always reading, and she hadn't wanted to as drunk to me.

37:38.175 --> 37:41.518
All right, I'm going to read you the closing section of the book now.

37:41.538 --> 37:45.823
We just have encouraged a little bit of the opening and the end.

37:46.158 --> 37:56.553
make a long loop with things with Yo-Yo, and come back and answer your original question, which is, what does it mean?

37:56.953 --> 38:04.584
What happens when your eye meets the print on the page?

38:04.604 --> 38:10.292
And what is that very intimate transaction that has the ability to make this who you are?

38:12.078 --> 38:16.365
When I began, I thought reading would transform my life, or at least teach me how to live it.

38:17.086 --> 38:21.573
It does teach something, many things, but not what I naively expected.

38:22.294 --> 38:26.480
In a bit of experience, snatches of the bookish wisdom do not serve.

38:27.081 --> 38:31.488
If no girl was ever ruined by a book, none was ever saved by one either.

38:32.610 --> 38:33.652
So what has been the point?

38:34.353 --> 38:37.798
Not to amass knowledge, since I forget the contents of the books.

38:37.930 --> 38:41.797
Certainly not to pass the time or kill it, as some say.

38:42.418 --> 38:43.300
Time will kill us.

38:45.985 --> 38:49.972
We kill time to sleep over as well as for future events as only dinner.

38:50.594 --> 38:55.703
But after dinner we find out an effect that we must kill some more till the next event.

38:56.155 --> 38:59.159
Plains the events of just a more dramatic means of killing.

38:59.880 --> 39:08.090
What we are waiting for, killing times to arrive at, is death, the only event that can release us from the burden of living in time.

39:08.932 --> 39:19.045
The other side of killing time is rushing about, going and doing in order to each moment to actively, assertively to live, merely under vow of mortality.

39:19.746 --> 39:21.748
Reading is an activity of the moment, too.

39:22.269 --> 39:25.453
Having read is no more palpable than the answer to this piece,

39:25.737 --> 39:34.490
But unlike classic activities of the moment, dance or sports or sex, movement through phases, in reading the body is still.

39:35.311 --> 39:43.003
Indeed, what can you teach us first and foremost is how to sit still for long periods and confront time head-on.

39:43.574 --> 39:56.827
The dynamism is all inside, and it solves its spiritual exercise so utterly engaging that we forget time and mortality, along with all of life's less reward, which is simply vast in the analyzing presence.

39:57.708 --> 40:02.332
So I see, finally, why it hardly matters whether I remember the contents of the book.

40:02.933 --> 40:06.776
Mere information is nothing compared to this solid flurry.

40:07.237 --> 40:12.602
The mind comes into its own, delighting in its liveness and power, its pirouettes

40:12.869 --> 40:16.114
leaps through the ball, embraces, and trembles.

40:16.775 --> 40:24.006
Algorithmic mere language begins with marks on a page, put there by a machine, recognizable as words.

40:24.707 --> 40:31.057
Each one he does something script, but he cannot reason as such, except in the first days of learning how.

40:31.919 --> 40:41.053
Still more remarkable, these inky marks generate emotion, even near the illusion of the conceiving emotion, while there's 20 who contributed the emotion.

40:41.523 --> 40:43.926
yet it was there in advance, too, as a writer.

40:44.587 --> 40:45.849
What if she is translucent?

40:46.490 --> 41:00.068
The emotive powers of the book, with no local habitations, passed safely from writer to reader, unmangled by the printing and binding and shipping, renewed and available whenever we open it.

41:00.088 --> 41:08.880
As well in the book, however remote in time and space, this imaginary being of a writer, this missing link whom no reader has ever glimpsed.

41:09.805 --> 41:23.824
From the visit of Dickens and Wiles, you remember how they came to greet a peer by thousands of cheering readers, to today's performances, readers flock to see writers to meet the person who was given them pleasure.

41:24.645 --> 41:28.891
Perhaps the consumers of telephone sets also hear them to meet the purveyors.

41:29.912 --> 41:31.435
But they were certainly disappointed.

41:32.015 --> 41:38.344
The writer in person is no more the voice behind the book than making the employee who murmurs salacious tidbits

41:38.712 --> 41:41.054
is inclined to stir us in actual life.

41:41.875 --> 41:46.940
Like the owner of the telephone voice, the writer is born into all fantasies.

41:46.960 --> 41:53.587
Reading her book would fashion her image, which had the sort of existence but never in flesh to the person bearing her name.

41:54.668 --> 42:04.578
Since the book, too, doesn't possess an independent or sensory existence, but must be open and found, we enjoy the handy power of being necessary to this life.

42:05.299 --> 42:08.382
The real book is the print sitting inside of the frog.

42:08.918 --> 42:12.487
We open it, and our eyes give it a kiss of regeneration.

42:13.870 --> 42:15.775
This power is what intoxicates.

42:16.477 --> 42:22.732
The thinking of others is not as the fear of our own free thinking, but meshes with it as blended right with recovery.

42:23.654 --> 42:25.138
If we make those happen,

42:25.490 --> 42:27.072
They make us happen as well.

42:27.653 --> 42:31.577
Greetings teaches receptivity, keeps his negative capability.

42:32.098 --> 42:37.765
It teaches us to receive the stillness and attentiveness, a voice he says temporarily on loan.

42:38.405 --> 42:44.252
The speaker lends herself and we do the same, mutual and federalist change, like love.

42:45.053 --> 42:47.536
Yet unlike love, we make the pure activity.

42:48.097 --> 42:50.720
It will gain us nothing but the chances of the heart.

42:51.201 --> 42:53.303
That's James James' phrase.

42:54.059 --> 43:05.714
And as we grow accustomed to receiving books in stillness and attentiveness, so we can grow to receive the world, also obsessed temporarily, also enchanted in the heart.

43:05.734 --> 43:09.039
Reading gives a context for experience, a merited context.

43:09.920 --> 43:15.427
Not that we will now be better at what we do when the time comes, but that we will not be taken unawares or in the void.

43:16.248 --> 43:23.678
When we are old and have everything stripped away, and wrath, the vanity of having had it, and grieving for its loss,

43:23.962 --> 43:35.713
yet remain bound in both vanity and grief, hugging the whole rotten package to our hearts in a magic, fierce embrace, we may think, King Lear, this has happened before.

43:36.314 --> 43:38.716
I am not in uncharted territory.

43:38.736 --> 43:41.078
Now it's my turn in the Great Recession.

43:42.359 --> 43:44.622
So much of a child's life has lived for others.

43:45.082 --> 43:50.687
We learn what they want us to learn and show our learning for their gratification.

43:50.707 --> 43:53.530
All the reading I do as a child behind closed doors

43:53.898 --> 43:58.624
Sitting on the bed while the darkness fell around me was an active reclamation.

43:59.265 --> 44:01.928
This, and only this, I did for myself.

44:02.789 --> 44:17.308
This was the way to make my life my own.

44:17.328 --> 44:17.689
Thank you.

44:17.709 --> 44:18.690
Thank you.

44:18.957 --> 44:26.871
Our next speaker is Alvaro Manguel, novelist, essayist, and translator.

44:26.892 --> 44:34.786
He was born in Argentina, things he had more common were born in the literature.

44:34.846 --> 44:43.041
As a teenager, Manguel met one in a one-fairy bookstore, where he worked and where he was invited to read to the blind person.

44:43.797 --> 44:51.900
Through this experience of reading aloud, and will assure some of our sensibilities as well,

44:52.657 --> 45:03.772
a gracious reader, a translator from Spanish, German, French, and Italian into English, and from English and French into Spanish.

45:04.452 --> 45:13.224
He is known not only for his scholarship, but for his wide-ranging knowledge of the various genres that he has published.

45:13.885 --> 45:21.735
And he also discussed Latin American ghost stories, European classic tales, American science fiction,

45:22.272 --> 45:41.074
He coauthored a Dictionary of Imaginary Places, which is a guidebook to more than 1,200 villages, kingdoms, continents, and countries that have been created by the ancient Greeks down to the present day.

45:42.472 --> 45:53.021
Manuel has worked as a book and theater critic and written Friesling Schwartz stories adapted novels and stories for radio and television in Canada.

45:54.082 --> 46:03.110
His credits describe him as astute and original editor of anthologies, which he sees as a function of his reading.

46:03.730 --> 46:11.517
He claims that every reader is in some measure an anthologist, a collector of what he or she likes best.

46:12.644 --> 46:32.294
Well, against this background, or foreground, or fringe of instant online access, cyberspace, CD-ROM technology, audio world, classic text being turned into Hollywood blockbuster movies, we have not only books, but readings.

46:33.476 --> 46:38.904
The simple, very intimate act of reading seems irreplaceable.

46:39.846 --> 46:41.368
How did reading begin?

46:42.243 --> 46:43.867
When did it become silent?

46:45.331 --> 46:47.417
Who are the greatest leaders of our time?

46:48.019 --> 46:55.158
Faith and hundreds of other questions are answered by Mr. Emmanuel in his newest book, A History of Reading.

46:55.218 --> 46:58.547
Please welcome Albert O'Meara.
