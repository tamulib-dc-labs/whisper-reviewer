WEBVTT

00:02.596 --> 00:04.238
No, we'll start with that.

00:04.578 --> 00:05.399
I'm talking to Carrie Gibbons.

00:05.459 --> 00:10.525
Did you know that that book in particular has been written?

00:10.565 --> 00:11.867
Yes.

00:11.887 --> 00:14.710
I know that I'm not that one in particular.

00:19.736 --> 00:21.398
How do you, let's just start.

00:21.779 --> 00:23.701
If you don't mind, we'll just enter the conversation.

00:23.741 --> 00:29.768
What kind of resonances do you think are there in that novel that might

00:30.271 --> 00:36.920
make it appropriate are good for younger students to read?

00:37.141 --> 00:45.492
I think it's good for younger students to read because the protagonist acts thoroughly.

00:46.093 --> 00:51.621
Her actions are dictated from her own heart, not from peer pressure.

00:52.422 --> 00:58.050
So it's a good book to teach a child how to be an individual.

00:58.503 --> 01:01.327
And she has her own individual style.

01:02.269 --> 01:04.352
So it's a good book in which to learn that.

01:04.913 --> 01:10.281
And it has things to say about race that are important to hear.

01:10.301 --> 01:14.948
I think it deals very honestly with race.

01:14.968 --> 01:20.076
And my own children will be reading it in school.

01:20.216 --> 01:21.438
It's assigned at home.

01:22.119 --> 01:24.562
So I'm sure when they do, I'll be show and tell.

01:25.043 --> 01:25.203
Sure.

01:25.644 --> 01:26.265
Well, I guess.

01:26.667 --> 01:32.354
My younger daughter is entering eighth grade, so this was summer reading for her.

01:32.415 --> 01:33.896
She had to read it this summer.

01:34.437 --> 01:35.258
It was kind of cute.

01:35.559 --> 01:37.141
I started walking around with this book.

01:37.241 --> 01:38.603
I thought it was my book.

01:38.683 --> 01:41.667
Maybe she'd grab for this interview.

01:41.687 --> 01:44.490
I said, I'd like to hear that woman.

01:44.731 --> 01:48.516
She talked very intelligently about her book.

01:48.996 --> 01:51.119
That's good to hear.

01:51.219 --> 01:52.641
Yeah, it is.

01:54.308 --> 02:07.389
It's amazing to me and gratifying, I think, that because that book is narrated by a younger person, that it was not marketed as a young adult book.

02:08.230 --> 02:18.426
I've heard it said that if Catcher in the Rye were to be written today, it would be classified as a young adult novel, if only because the protagonist is a young person.

02:18.946 --> 02:21.029
How do you feel about that?

02:21.049 --> 02:24.113
I'm delighted that that was able to transcend it.

02:24.674 --> 02:25.155
I am too.

02:25.555 --> 02:43.440
I had much rather that it be sold primarily as a book for adults and then meander its way down the... through an age barrier, actually, which is, you know, about 19 or 20.

02:44.041 --> 02:46.024
People start reading different books.

02:46.044 --> 02:46.945
Sure.

02:46.965 --> 02:47.586
So...

02:48.697 --> 02:50.519
Do you have a sense of your reader?

02:51.880 --> 02:54.162
You've written quite a few books now.

02:55.183 --> 02:55.663
I do.

02:55.824 --> 03:04.211
She's about 40 and she's got a child or three children and she works.

03:05.492 --> 03:07.514
That's about who it is.

03:08.055 --> 03:09.596
She's definitely a she.

03:10.036 --> 03:10.357
She.

03:10.957 --> 03:16.122
I'm having more and more men come to the readings.

03:16.996 --> 03:22.782
And that fascinates me, and I may start asking them why, because I want to know.

03:23.043 --> 03:26.206
Does it fascinate you, or surprise you, or both?

03:27.748 --> 03:29.330
It surprises me, I think.

03:29.390 --> 03:30.711
Why would it surprise you?

03:30.731 --> 03:43.425
Because these books are so strongly about women, and they have such a strong appeal to women that it would

03:43.658 --> 03:47.924
I ran into a woman who liked Tom Clancy.

03:49.006 --> 03:49.186
You know?

03:49.867 --> 04:02.886
Except that, with all due respect, Tom Clancy is really not, in my view, certainly, and I think most reasonable critics, what you'd call a literary writer.

04:02.926 --> 04:05.710
I mean, he writes entertainment and stuff.

04:05.730 --> 04:12.079
I do sense, and the critics undoubtedly agree, that you are striving for something

04:12.363 --> 04:17.187
I'm striving for something a little bit higher than that.

04:17.247 --> 04:18.128
Yes, I am.

04:18.809 --> 04:26.996
I'd like to know that I'm picking up more and more male readers.

04:27.036 --> 04:32.261
My husband was reading my books long before we met.

04:32.662 --> 04:39.788
So, he was like, Honey, why did you read my books before we met?

04:42.552 --> 04:45.036
Can you think and tell us when you come out?

04:46.898 --> 04:47.259
Okay.

04:48.942 --> 05:01.901
In addition to the perceived audience, do you also identify yourself as a, quote, Southern writer or whatever that entails?

05:02.842 --> 05:12.036
I think of myself as a writer who lives in the South and writes about the South primarily.

05:12.691 --> 05:26.285
But I don't think of myself as a regional writer, writing books that deal primarily with the issues of that region.

05:26.325 --> 05:37.476
One of the reasons is because the issues that are in play in the South are in play everywhere else.

05:37.496 --> 05:42.681
The South doesn't have its own set of peculiar problems anymore.

05:43.167 --> 05:48.174
But you certainly emerged from how distinctively or traditionally.

05:48.194 --> 05:48.635
Oh, yes.

05:48.675 --> 05:51.158
We were at Faulkner's house last week.

05:52.160 --> 06:04.437
And I guess I didn't realize until I went to his house that he's the most written about writer with the exception of Shakespeare.

06:05.398 --> 06:07.301
I don't know why I thought it might.

06:08.282 --> 06:12.448
I don't know who else I thought it might be, but...

06:14.386 --> 06:22.079
which is amazing, isn't it, because in his lifetime, so many of his books went out of print, and he had to be rediscovered.

06:22.099 --> 06:27.428
And The Sound and the Fury was called a major blow-up by a minor talent.

06:27.448 --> 06:40.410
Yeah, well, you know, I collect books for various bizarre reasons of 19th century literary criticism of American books, and not just criticism, but

06:41.099 --> 06:42.822
literary studies, and it's amazing.

06:43.202 --> 06:50.954
I have yet to find a book published while Melville was alive that has anything at all to say about it, let alone anything good or bad.

06:50.994 --> 06:53.918
I mean, he was totally dismissed in his lifetime.

06:53.958 --> 07:04.594
He had to wait until the 1920s to be rediscovered, so what some newspaper critic might say is quite irrelevant to the whole thing.

07:04.614 --> 07:07.258
You obviously have no trouble assuming

07:07.778 --> 07:20.332
the voice of an adolescent in your fiction, and that you were able to do this in your first book, and that you're actually going to do it again in this book.

07:20.352 --> 07:21.053
Tell me about that.

07:21.073 --> 07:23.375
I mean, obviously, it doesn't seem to date you at all.

07:23.395 --> 07:25.037
You don't find that formidable.

07:25.057 --> 07:35.068
Well, I enjoy reading first person, Studs Terkel, transcribed narrative.

07:35.740 --> 07:40.386
Like the good boy, for example, had a great impact on me.

07:42.208 --> 07:48.836
I did an interview on his show a couple years ago, and I've got a reading with him Saturday night.

07:49.016 --> 07:50.358
Oh, really?

07:50.378 --> 07:53.702
I'll tell him that you didn't torture me or anything.

07:53.722 --> 07:56.365
No, I'm not.

07:56.385 --> 07:57.246
I do this today by living.

07:58.387 --> 08:03.874
Anyway, they had a profound influence because I understood

08:04.799 --> 08:10.646
through reading them that the human voice could be an artistic instrument and could be used.

08:10.666 --> 08:22.820
And I didn't have to create, thank you, create distance with a third person narrator in order to tell a story.

08:23.321 --> 08:33.793
And also I have children of my own and I was just looking through a catalog to order fall clothes before he came in.

08:34.921 --> 08:41.271
And so it's really not hard for me to assume the voice of a child.

08:41.391 --> 08:45.277
And your children are, I think you have three girls, is that right?

08:45.298 --> 08:45.678
I have three girls.

08:45.698 --> 08:46.379
Yeah, I have two girls.

08:46.399 --> 08:55.113
So that helps, I'm sure, when you're... I'm sure you can just kind of listen in and pick up certain things that... Does that help you at all?

08:55.133 --> 08:55.894
It really does.

08:56.495 --> 08:57.036
It does.

08:57.277 --> 09:00.722
This is my husband, Frank Ward.

09:01.063 --> 09:02.565
So why did you read my book?

09:03.305 --> 09:15.577
Because Eudora Welty and Walker Percy told me to.

09:15.597 --> 09:18.640
And because I wanted to be prepared when I met you.

09:19.481 --> 09:20.562
But you knew you were going to meet her.

09:20.882 --> 09:21.383
Oh, yes.

09:22.724 --> 09:23.785
That was necessary.

09:23.925 --> 09:27.308
Is that right?

09:27.349 --> 09:28.890
You're from...

09:29.123 --> 09:31.225
from the same part of the country, I guess.

09:31.305 --> 09:37.852
I have to say that I quite agree with your husband.

09:37.872 --> 09:54.388
I mean, I think anything that Walker Percy or Eudora Welty... I don't want to pay much stock in blurbs, I have to say, but on the other hand, I think that anything that Walker Percy has recommended, I don't think he'd recommend anything that he didn't believe in, or Eudora Welty.

09:54.408 --> 09:57.932
And I have to say those endorsements

09:59.110 --> 10:01.894
carry a great deal of weight.

10:03.876 --> 10:06.340
And also I heard she was scared.

10:10.064 --> 10:11.967
Would you like me to order some coffee?

10:11.987 --> 10:13.048
No, no, thanks.

10:13.309 --> 10:16.793
I had some in the way.

10:16.813 --> 10:17.414
I'm sorry.

10:18.295 --> 10:21.860
Do you see, no, this is five books now, I guess.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.042
Five.

10:24.023 --> 10:24.964
And you're in your thirties.

10:25.485 --> 10:26.186
Thirty-five.

10:26.266 --> 10:28.589
Thirty-five.

10:28.649 --> 10:28.729
Wow.

10:29.620 --> 10:32.723
I've also read that you decided to be a writer.

10:32.743 --> 10:43.996
This isn't something that you felt impelled to do, which is kind of different from all the writers that I've interviewed over the years.

10:44.536 --> 10:53.166
So many describe the process of obsession or being drawn or whatever, but I guess that's not the case.

10:53.687 --> 10:58.632
No, I was going to continue in school and get my PhD and teach.

10:59.523 --> 11:07.410
American literature or, yeah, I was much more interested in American literature.

11:08.471 --> 11:12.254
And that was the track that I had laid down for myself.

11:13.175 --> 11:17.819
And I wrote Ellen Foster and it was published.

11:17.979 --> 11:20.622
And that was by Algonquin.

11:20.642 --> 11:21.262
Algonquin.

11:21.382 --> 11:24.865
And I realized that I could make a living doing this.

11:24.885 --> 11:26.427
And it was fun.

11:26.587 --> 11:27.808
I knew how to do it.

11:28.328 --> 11:30.231
It wasn't back-breaking.

11:31.414 --> 11:37.044
And I could do it and be at home with my children or my child at the time.

11:37.565 --> 11:41.452
So it seemed like the best of all possible careers.

11:41.472 --> 11:49.707
So I stopped going to school and started writing full-time.

11:50.148 --> 11:52.632
So, pardon me, but you had this

11:53.438 --> 11:58.243
most unusual experience of really not suffering the sting of rejection, I gather.

11:58.263 --> 11:59.465
It was very unusual.

11:59.485 --> 12:03.109
I will never get that lucky again.

12:05.732 --> 12:06.513
Was this the case?

12:06.533 --> 12:07.414
Did you have an agent?

12:07.434 --> 12:09.576
Did you place it yourself with Ogonquin?

12:09.816 --> 12:21.589
I showed the pages myself to my teacher and then we found an agent while I was a student.

12:21.629 --> 12:23.091
At UNC in a

12:23.678 --> 12:27.564
class called The History of Southern Literature.

12:27.604 --> 12:31.390
Not in writing class, because I don't believe in them.

12:31.410 --> 12:33.213
I've read that.

12:33.293 --> 12:38.922
I've read that actually you feel you can identify books that have emerged from workshops.

12:39.082 --> 12:41.166
And I think I can do that myself.

12:41.286 --> 12:41.807
Yeah.

12:43.649 --> 12:46.254
Especially if they're written about the English department.

12:47.455 --> 12:49.078
That's a dead giveaway, isn't it?

12:49.683 --> 13:04.944
Flannery O'Connor was once asked at University of Chicago if she thought writing programs stifled young people, and she said, I don't think it stifles enough of them.

13:04.964 --> 13:07.908
You affected that accent.

13:08.609 --> 13:09.470
I love Flannery.

13:09.570 --> 13:11.693
I wish I could afford her.

13:13.376 --> 13:15.859
Thank God, a wise lad for me.

13:15.991 --> 13:18.254
For my anniversary last year.

13:18.454 --> 13:19.836
You're a collector, I gather.

13:19.896 --> 13:23.881
I have a book out just now with Holt on bibliomania.

13:23.901 --> 13:25.223
Oh, you do?

13:25.243 --> 13:30.189
Yeah, I've had a couple of, just getting reviewed now.

13:30.209 --> 13:32.291
Wonderful review of the Washington Post.

13:32.311 --> 13:34.735
We have, I think, between 4,000 and 4,200.

13:34.875 --> 13:35.556
Okay.

13:35.576 --> 13:36.457
First edition?

13:37.979 --> 13:38.900
Mostly.

13:38.920 --> 13:41.062
Well, what do you collect?

13:41.563 --> 13:42.384
Anything.

13:42.424 --> 13:45.508
We're trying to finish the Wellkies and...

13:45.893 --> 13:48.316
What would you say we collect?

13:48.616 --> 13:52.621
We like first births?

13:53.102 --> 13:53.202
Ms.

13:53.222 --> 13:54.243
Walter's photographs.

13:54.604 --> 13:54.664
Ms.

13:54.684 --> 13:58.228
Walter's photographs.

13:58.248 --> 13:58.449
I have Ms.

13:58.469 --> 13:58.909
Walter's photographs.

13:59.230 --> 14:13.167
I have, I think, one of the great, I don't know, I'm being a modest here in character, but one of the great Walker Percy collect to take everything, including his first published work which preceded

14:13.653 --> 14:20.099
the moviegoer by five years, signed by him, moviegoer with two dust jackets, you know.

14:21.680 --> 14:24.582
I have all of his Uncle Will's stuff signed.

14:24.943 --> 14:27.425
I have to say it's wonderful, wonderful.

14:28.866 --> 14:32.689
When you said Walker Percy, I said, well, we're talking, you know.

14:32.709 --> 14:35.632
He has written a book on Biblia Madness.

14:35.652 --> 14:36.633
Oh, it's just out.

14:36.653 --> 14:38.314
It's called A Gentle Madness.

14:38.695 --> 14:41.257
He's had some wonderful reviews.

14:41.537 --> 14:42.698
Well, Woodford's mind is

14:42.965 --> 14:46.149
Oh, yeah, it's got a wonderful dust jacket.

14:46.169 --> 14:48.311
It's a book fool.

14:49.012 --> 14:52.976
It's a spectacular jacket for me.

14:52.996 --> 14:56.981
It started printing already within the first month of publication.

14:57.001 --> 15:01.146
I'm not here to talk about my book, but I did notice that you collect books.

15:01.166 --> 15:03.448
That's very impressive, very.

15:03.468 --> 15:03.929
Oh, thanks.

15:04.009 --> 15:09.175
It's my first book at the age of 52.

15:09.712 --> 15:15.359
I find, that's why I have to say, I find your achievements so remarkable.

15:15.459 --> 15:19.263
And I hope you don't mind if we really don't talk that much about Watts.

15:19.323 --> 15:20.645
That's my job.

15:20.665 --> 15:24.129
Yeah, that's about my thing, because I don't know that much, Rob.

15:24.329 --> 15:31.858
I have to say, fiction writers, for me, are the most challenging individuals for a variety of reasons.

15:31.879 --> 15:38.166
I mean, nonfiction, you can talk about sort of things, but I think with an artistic work,

15:39.614 --> 15:43.960
that behooves the reader to try and define what the process of what's going on.

15:44.541 --> 15:52.832
But there are certain themes that we can't see through your body of work and maybe you could discuss how you see your body of work.

15:52.852 --> 15:58.239
I mean, there are certainly patterns that recur in all of the books.

15:58.299 --> 15:59.300
Would you agree with that?

16:00.142 --> 16:00.842
I think so.

16:01.023 --> 16:08.693
There's that looking for affection or looking for a home, looking for some

16:09.247 --> 16:38.545
sort of family connection there's always a character who is in need of that um and i've just been told all this by a scholar recently who studied everything and she had one chapter called things and patterns and themes and giving his work and i read it very carefully in order to remember everything that she said so one thing she said

16:39.065 --> 16:41.188
was just looking for attention.

16:41.669 --> 16:46.556
And death is also important in every book.

16:46.616 --> 16:53.687
There's always a death that informs the mood of the rest of the book.

16:55.069 --> 17:03.222
Does that amuse you to see things, to see your work discussed in a scholarly fashion?

17:03.282 --> 17:03.983
Oh, yes.

17:04.423 --> 17:06.827
It pleases me because it

17:07.347 --> 17:17.339
helps me and I feel, it's nice to know that it's being taken seriously.

17:18.981 --> 17:20.282
Do you ever say, gee, that's right?

17:21.424 --> 17:28.091
Yeah, about all those emerging things, especially the one about the looking for love.

17:29.253 --> 17:34.519
I thought back and then said, yes, that's exactly.

17:35.005 --> 17:48.759
Well, in this book, for instance, I noticed early on, I think, on page 79 or 80, you saw the narrator says, she talked about birthday presents, and what she really wants, she doesn't want a toy or something for her collection, what she really wants is her mother.

17:48.839 --> 17:49.960
Her mother, yeah.

17:50.140 --> 17:58.589
And that's, you know, that, that explains, that's the theme that you're talking about a long way here.

17:59.030 --> 18:01.452
Do you see it, now you're, again, you're not,

18:02.512 --> 18:09.963
to dwell on your age, but you are certainly a young woman with many, many years of work ahead of you.

18:10.985 --> 18:14.650
How do you see your work developing?

18:15.531 --> 18:29.953
Do you think that when these scholars of the next century, well into the next centuries, take a look at your body of work, do you think that they'll see something

18:30.271 --> 18:40.806
beginning with Ellen Foster and making a general progression to the same corpus, I guess, as a... I would like for them to get denser and more complicated.

18:41.948 --> 18:45.112
I'd like to have more characters.

18:46.694 --> 18:53.103
I would like to write a big Civil War book, and I'm working on that right now.

18:55.066 --> 18:55.567
Narrated?

18:56.268 --> 18:59.873
The first person by different narrators.

19:00.342 --> 19:08.009
different women who have to deal with Union troops in North Carolina and Georgia.

19:10.912 --> 19:15.236
So that's going to be my big two or three year project.

19:15.337 --> 19:20.782
Is that a challenge for you to have a number of different voices?

19:20.902 --> 19:22.023
Oh yes.

19:22.784 --> 19:23.645
I've done two.

19:23.665 --> 19:26.788
It's like juggling.

19:26.928 --> 19:30.231
I could juggle two baseballs, but now

19:30.616 --> 19:48.502
I'll be juggling eggs and turnips and baseballs and bowling balls, and it's hard to juggle voices of varying weight and tone, but that's what I'll have to do.

19:48.522 --> 20:00.319
Dr. Oh once told me during an interview that he likens what he does to a metrilobus, to projecting a voice.

20:00.772 --> 20:02.435
Would you agree with that?

20:02.855 --> 20:03.696
Oh, I think so.

20:04.357 --> 20:06.160
I'm reading one of his books right now.

20:07.743 --> 20:08.404
Which one?

20:08.624 --> 20:09.305
Waterwork.

20:09.325 --> 20:09.986
Yeah, I like that.

20:10.006 --> 20:10.727
It's okay.

20:11.048 --> 20:12.190
They've got mixed reviews.

20:12.951 --> 20:16.857
I keep getting mixed up in it, and he keeps repeating himself.

20:16.937 --> 20:22.866
I know he's looking for the father and the son, and I know.

20:22.886 --> 20:25.570
Just go find them, don't keep saying it.

20:26.572 --> 20:29.496
But I thought Ragtime was absolutely grand.

20:30.607 --> 20:34.193
in a model of how to write using history.

20:35.194 --> 20:38.239
History did not use him, he used history.

20:38.259 --> 20:40.923
Yeah, and I like Billy a lot too, Billy Beck.

20:41.464 --> 20:42.546
I just finished that.

20:43.687 --> 20:52.461
Do you find that when you read other contemporary fiction writers that you read it kind of like a carpenter might examine?

20:52.641 --> 20:53.142
I do.

20:54.184 --> 20:56.968
Like a watchmaker looks like a watch.

20:57.995 --> 20:58.976
I don't read it.

20:58.996 --> 21:02.040
I read it hard.

21:02.841 --> 21:03.682
Hard on the book.

21:03.702 --> 21:08.968
But you're studying it to see what... You're not reading it just for pleasure or for... No.

21:08.988 --> 21:17.158
You're really trying to figure out, not figure out, but study... Even Robert Parker, I take a part.

21:17.478 --> 21:17.759
Really?

21:18.560 --> 21:22.224
And I find I can learn about dialogue from him.

21:22.244 --> 21:25.588
He really writes down exactly what people say.

21:26.632 --> 21:29.776
And that sounds easy, but it's very difficult.

21:29.796 --> 21:32.119
No, it's good dialogue.

21:32.760 --> 21:35.543
It's so wonderful because it doesn't draw attention to itself.

21:35.603 --> 21:35.824
Exactly.

21:35.844 --> 21:40.109
But when it's contrived, it's the focus you've ever seen, you know.

21:40.570 --> 21:42.472
I feel that very precisely.

21:43.293 --> 21:47.218
Did you read The Bookman's Way, the John Donning, about the first division?

21:47.238 --> 21:48.220
Yeah, I did, yeah.

21:48.240 --> 21:52.265
That dialogue was really canned, really contrived.

21:52.285 --> 21:54.107
And I'm kind of, well,

21:55.252 --> 21:56.854
But he did very well, you know.

21:56.894 --> 22:01.020
Books on books, I have to say, do exceedingly.

22:01.101 --> 22:06.068
In fact, I'm... His books go out of nowhere.

22:07.069 --> 22:10.935
Book to Die, I guess.

22:11.976 --> 22:14.720
Those first editions are like $100 now.

22:14.740 --> 22:17.444
That first book, people would expect it to do anything.

22:18.906 --> 22:22.151
I would get off on that.

22:22.171 --> 22:23.453
I've also read that...

22:24.968 --> 22:34.378
that you don't see your writing as a cathartic experience, even though there are a lot of residences from your own life.

22:34.398 --> 22:37.922
Is that a fear?

22:38.102 --> 22:38.742
Yeah.

22:38.762 --> 22:50.275
I think I look at writing as my daily companion.

22:51.155 --> 22:53.558
I have my husband and my children.

22:54.061 --> 22:55.683
And then I have the writing.

22:56.804 --> 23:08.738
And I look at it with not so much an emotional awe, but with a cast of calder on it.

23:09.539 --> 23:10.741
It's how I make my living.

23:11.422 --> 23:12.763
Writing is what I do.

23:12.783 --> 23:18.430
I read, I write, look after children.

23:18.510 --> 23:21.874
I have a wonderful husband.

23:23.525 --> 23:24.547
and that's about it.

23:25.728 --> 23:31.557
I watch some soap operas, but I really don't have much of a life outside of that.

23:31.898 --> 23:33.520
I keep things very simple.

23:37.907 --> 23:40.771
But, Frank, can you give me some better language?

23:41.592 --> 23:43.275
Oh, yeah.

23:43.916 --> 23:46.399
Don't even, don't be so critical.

23:46.520 --> 23:52.148
But this is not a cathartic.

23:52.803 --> 23:55.486
What would you say?

23:55.986 --> 23:57.728
We talk about this.

23:57.748 --> 24:05.557
Well, I like the tension between the complexity of your work and the simplicity of your life.

24:06.298 --> 24:14.146
As if five children, five dogs, two gerbils, eight gerbils, and two cats could be simple.

24:14.166 --> 24:22.135
Something of the cold streams and the elements you write about in the last

24:22.942 --> 24:27.167
like your own complexity of strength and sweetness.

24:28.128 --> 24:35.937
But the life is simple and just apart from the complexity of organizing all of the people.

24:36.017 --> 24:37.459
But Kay knows where to put the mark.

24:37.479 --> 24:39.261
You know, people stand on the stage.

24:39.942 --> 24:44.648
Now, Frank, obviously you knew Kay's work before you knew Kay, is that right?

24:44.668 --> 24:45.188
Yep.

24:45.208 --> 24:50.234
And so, I mean, if you don't mind, do you mind my getting a couple books?

24:50.254 --> 24:50.575
No, no.

24:50.595 --> 24:52.577
This is interesting for me.

24:52.928 --> 25:08.124
Could you tell me a little, I mean, were you, obviously you read a lot of literature and... I used to read new books over in New Zealand in Raleigh.

25:08.144 --> 25:17.073
I did it because I'm a lawyer and I had an unhealthy amount of plurid phrases in my legal way.

25:17.533 --> 25:22.058
I was looking for a way to supplement that.

25:22.949 --> 25:26.534
I read books and reviewed and knew about Chad.

25:27.616 --> 25:42.597
As I said before, I like going to bed with a good court, but it's even better to go to bed with a great writer.

25:42.638 --> 25:44.741
That's great clothes.

25:44.761 --> 25:45.321
Great.

25:46.603 --> 25:48.826
Great bed.

25:48.847 --> 25:49.307
I'm sorry.

25:51.050 --> 25:51.851
Yeah, that's fine.

25:51.871 --> 25:52.652
That's good.

25:53.375 --> 26:03.889
I think it's one of the writers of the New Testament who said the word made flesh.

26:03.909 --> 26:05.451
Did you contrive to meet her?

26:06.653 --> 26:23.095
I would have been necessary, but it wasn't necessary, because we were both, she was the writer in residence for the library at the school in Raleigh, and I was president on the board.

26:23.480 --> 26:26.423
got asked to introduce her.

26:26.443 --> 26:27.744
This is a friend's group?

26:27.844 --> 26:28.085
Yes.

26:29.366 --> 26:30.948
And we got to know each other that way.

26:31.068 --> 26:35.893
When I met her, she was bulging with her third child.

26:35.913 --> 26:37.174
She was nine months pregnant.

26:37.214 --> 26:39.316
Nine months, almost to the day.

26:39.336 --> 26:41.018
So cute.

26:41.038 --> 26:41.899
Big ankles.

26:43.861 --> 26:49.546
I put only 65 pounds.

26:49.587 --> 26:50.928
Which school was this?

26:50.948 --> 26:52.069
North Carolina State.

26:54.057 --> 26:58.421
Yeah, I'm the past just outgoing president of the Friends of the Goddard Library.

26:58.441 --> 27:01.844
Clark came with me.

27:01.864 --> 27:02.765
I'm speaking now.

27:02.865 --> 27:13.615
I interviewed her a number of times, which gave me a lot of opportunity to think about her and her work.

27:13.896 --> 27:14.977
And I like that.

27:14.997 --> 27:22.984
So, what otherwise, just briefly, this is not an interview with your husband, but it is a nice difference.

27:23.892 --> 27:28.478
What other writers do you read?

27:28.619 --> 27:34.086
I read a lot of history and biography as well as literature.

27:34.166 --> 27:43.820
When I finished college, I went to, I taught in Athens for a year, and liked the modern Greek poets.

27:44.220 --> 27:46.684
Athens, Greece?

27:46.704 --> 27:47.485
Greece, I mentioned.

27:47.565 --> 27:52.071
Being a Greek-American, I... Oh, yeah.

27:52.512 --> 27:52.752
Interesting.

27:53.137 --> 28:22.603
Well, we did read that new Patricia Cornwall book all at one time.

28:24.254 --> 28:26.878
Anyway, you work now with Faith Sale.

28:27.218 --> 28:27.298
Yes.

28:27.318 --> 28:29.942
You're a wonderful editor.

28:30.743 --> 28:37.874
Do you find that working with an editor, I mean, do you work in the traditional Max Perkins kind of editor kind of way?

28:37.974 --> 28:39.596
Well, she and I do.

28:40.397 --> 28:46.065
I send her about, what did you say, 50 pages at a time, Frank?

28:47.548 --> 28:47.928
Yes.

28:47.948 --> 28:49.771
About 50 pages.

28:49.791 --> 28:52.675
And we work on it that way, but with a Civil War book.

28:53.414 --> 29:03.203
I think I'm going to be a big girl and write the whole thing on my very own and then send it to her.

29:04.725 --> 29:08.048
Do you do this with any degree of anxiety at all?

29:08.588 --> 29:11.771
In terms of what her response might be?

29:12.332 --> 29:15.194
Is it a... I can read her mind.

29:15.294 --> 29:16.536
It is.

29:16.716 --> 29:18.738
We can read each other's minds.

29:20.159 --> 29:22.341
What does an editor bring to her?

29:23.114 --> 29:24.757
I'm not a fiction writer.

29:30.065 --> 29:34.813
A wonderful second-guessing, necessary second-guessing.

29:37.537 --> 29:50.218
She comes behind me and points to places in the manuscript, say a place I remember specifically in which I had

29:51.734 --> 30:02.490
described the character quickly and she thought that he needed to be explored more and she said, you need more here.

30:02.550 --> 30:18.113
And within a few minutes I had rewritten, I had written a new paragraph explaining this very minor character and she has me open up the story.

30:18.515 --> 30:23.922
And about every three or four pages, she'll put her finger down and say, I want to know more.

30:23.942 --> 30:29.569
And she causes, literally, causes me to think.

30:30.951 --> 30:34.475
Causes being an operative verb.

30:35.837 --> 30:42.626
Let's talk a bit about this novel, because it is interesting.

30:42.646 --> 30:48.193
Tell me about the genesis of this world search.

30:48.253 --> 30:48.353
Yeah.

30:49.396 --> 30:55.162
It started out as two books that were joined together and I didn't realize it.

30:57.825 --> 31:01.388
There were two books told in alternating chapters.

31:02.029 --> 31:09.456
The girl's childhood and then her adulthood and I had the girl grow up and be abused by her husband.

31:11.398 --> 31:18.846
Last October, my editor and I talked and we realized that

31:20.024 --> 31:23.968
I had two books and they needed to be split.

31:23.988 --> 31:32.335
So I sat at the dining room table and separated the story into two stacks.

31:33.116 --> 31:43.205
And then the stack that seemed to be close enough to being a novel, I kept that stack and I threw the other stack away.

31:43.245 --> 31:45.146
What was the other stack?

31:45.767 --> 31:49.170
About Hattie growing up and being abused by her husband.

31:49.690 --> 31:54.458
page after page after page of being a victim.

31:55.360 --> 31:57.724
It was awful, just awful.

31:57.985 --> 31:58.846
So why was it in there?

32:00.068 --> 32:07.401
Because I'm the type of writer who has to write through a lot of material to get to what's good.

32:07.442 --> 32:13.352
This book went through eight drafts.

32:13.703 --> 32:17.408
or is it being kept in the drawer for future use?

32:17.428 --> 32:20.111
No, I threw it away and erased it from the computer.

32:20.131 --> 32:22.173
I never wanted to see it again.

32:22.354 --> 32:31.365
So it may have, in some stage, been two books, but really it's still one book.

32:31.385 --> 32:32.486
Yeah, yeah.

32:32.506 --> 32:33.868
Maybe it was a process of learning.

32:33.908 --> 32:35.610
I mean, would you say that

32:35.860 --> 32:40.847
this material that you wrote about, Hattie, is still just part of her life, in spite of her history?

32:40.867 --> 32:45.674
It's part of her, yeah, it's part of her unwritten history.

32:45.815 --> 32:47.357
Which you have to know, don't you?

32:47.377 --> 33:03.741
And I have to know what becomes of her, and that's the only reason that it was necessary for me to write that other material that probably took a year of my life, and four hours a day for a year is a lot of time.

33:04.193 --> 33:07.618
and then to take that material and throw it away.

33:07.638 --> 33:23.300
That's one of the hardest things I do as a writer, but it is better to throw it away than put it in the book and have it bring down the quality of the book.

33:23.320 --> 33:27.606
Well, it may have been work that you threw away, but it wasn't wasted work.

33:27.626 --> 33:27.926
Yes.

33:28.327 --> 33:31.872
It certainly was part of the process of creating it.

33:32.510 --> 33:36.174
I can think of one chapter that my daughter erased by mistake.

33:36.755 --> 33:39.318
That was totally lost on my computer.

33:39.358 --> 33:42.362
That I didn't mean to throw away.

33:42.382 --> 33:46.687
That was a chapter that had to be rewritten.

33:49.991 --> 33:51.933
So you have these two things.

33:52.034 --> 34:01.605
Now, was this your conclusion, or was this working in concert with the editor, where you decided this was irrelevant?

34:02.041 --> 34:10.110
It was my decision and then she called and the same day we reached the same conclusion.

34:11.571 --> 34:18.138
And as late as October the book was still pretty much a mess.

34:18.679 --> 34:31.913
All the material was there but it was in the wrong place and I went to New York and we figured out what should happen first.

34:32.230 --> 34:49.426
clearly this bookend wasn't that, you don't plot these things in advance, do you have to say they emerge?

34:49.526 --> 35:02.018
No, I'm gonna, I think I'm gonna outline the Civil War book daily in the morning, write about what I'm gonna do that day, and I think

35:02.234 --> 35:15.854
That's going to be the most wholesome way to write that book, because it will, anytime you're dealing with Sherman, things can get out of hand.

35:17.156 --> 35:25.028
Is it a matter of, I think I've also read where you really don't know what, obviously you know what the next book is going to be, the Civil War book.

35:25.048 --> 35:26.290
Is this the next book, by the way?

35:26.310 --> 35:27.051
That's the next book.

35:27.311 --> 35:30.336
And so you expect this will take a couple, two, three years?

35:30.356 --> 35:30.977
Two years.

35:31.578 --> 35:31.718
Uh-huh.

35:32.204 --> 35:33.546
So you know what that one is.

35:33.626 --> 35:44.402
But when you sit down to say, well, okay, I've got a contract to do another book, my next book, do you know what this book is?

35:44.502 --> 35:57.561
Or is this a kind of, some kind of an alchemy that takes place where you, the creative process kicks in and stories kind of, you pull them out of midair, you know, as kids as a musician?

35:58.042 --> 35:59.624
I start hearing language.

36:00.005 --> 36:00.726
I start,

36:01.685 --> 36:04.449
Do you relate the language with the character?

36:04.689 --> 36:06.491
I do.

36:07.332 --> 36:17.526
I build a character around a voice and then pretty soon a name will come into my mind and things emerge slowly.

36:19.368 --> 36:28.620
People, characters step out of shadows and make themselves known.

36:29.107 --> 36:31.030
And then I can write about them.

36:31.050 --> 36:33.513
I can follow them around and see what occurs.

36:34.134 --> 36:41.004
And I'm starting to feel some of that excitement with the Civil War book.

36:42.326 --> 36:45.250
Are you having to do much historical research?

36:45.391 --> 36:45.871
Oh, yes.

36:45.911 --> 36:47.033
Because you've done that also.

36:47.153 --> 36:50.819
I guess you mentioned historical work on World War II.

36:50.839 --> 36:56.667
I've been researching since January 1st, and I have one more good size.

36:57.845 --> 37:00.568
diary to read, and then I'll be ready.

37:01.749 --> 37:03.611
A published diary?

37:03.711 --> 37:04.893
A published diary, yes.

37:05.814 --> 37:08.096
Published by the North Carolina archives.

37:08.777 --> 37:10.579
They're not widely distributed.

37:11.800 --> 37:27.717
But you're looking for insights into... I'm looking for what they dressed, how much the food cost, domestic detail, and also idiosyncrasies of 19th century language which were abundant.

37:28.895 --> 37:37.567
A book you might want to look into, just as a reference to it, because you probably already know it, is the Harvard University American Regional Dictionary.

37:37.587 --> 37:39.049
It's three volumes now.

37:40.411 --> 37:45.839
Really, it's American regional language from very specific parts of the country.

37:45.859 --> 37:53.370
I know Bruce Old used that as a reference to this John Brown book, and you should take a look into it.

37:53.390 --> 37:55.252
American, it's the Harvard University.

37:55.593 --> 37:56.935
It's up to three volumes.

37:57.075 --> 37:58.497
It's kind of like an OED

37:59.000 --> 38:05.126
of Americanisms, and you'll really find some... Harvard University Press.

38:05.147 --> 38:06.208
Yeah, Harvard University Press.

38:06.228 --> 38:09.892
If you'd give me a card or something, I'll send you the exam or a fact or something.

38:09.912 --> 38:14.136
I'd be happy to send you the stuff on it.

38:14.156 --> 38:14.336
Oh, good.

38:14.356 --> 38:18.501
Do you have a PO box or something?

38:18.661 --> 38:27.370
Okay, it's 918-Cowper, C-O-W-P-E-R, Droz, Raleigh.

38:28.278 --> 38:29.239
27608.

38:29.259 --> 38:30.762
Okay, good.

38:30.782 --> 38:37.992
I have quite a few Southern papers, by the way, to take my call.

38:38.072 --> 38:40.115
I work for a while.

38:40.175 --> 38:46.725
I form my own syndicated newspapers, and I have specifically targeting university towns.

38:46.925 --> 38:57.340
So I'm in Knoxville every week, and I'm in Gainesville, and I'm in Charlottesville, and Tallahassee is particularly interested in my pieces on women, so I'm kind of a little selfless from there.

38:58.433 --> 39:02.798
and Salt Lake City, and Toledo, and Eugene, Oregon, and all of them.

39:02.819 --> 39:09.607
So I think this would be a very interesting piece for them.

39:11.169 --> 39:26.348
Going back to the two novels, the two books from which you instilled this one, was that theme of the daughter trying to understand the relationship with the mother, was that the most

39:26.564 --> 39:27.545
more powerful?

39:27.585 --> 39:31.528
Was this something that you started out with when you always said it?

39:31.548 --> 39:37.553
It was always there, and it became the overwhelming predominant thing.

39:38.974 --> 39:56.149
I'm not sure what the overwhelming theme of the Civil War book is going to be, but I hope I understand soon, because it is hard to start writing without having a

39:56.737 --> 39:57.918
general idea.

39:57.958 --> 40:05.366
I'm just going to start when I get back writing down what people say and hope that something occurs.

40:06.267 --> 40:21.622
I haven't asked you all, other interviewers have, and I've read this stuff about the questions of the autobiographical residences that are in here, may or may not be in your work.

40:23.084 --> 40:24.145
Do you find

40:24.766 --> 40:29.912
Was this an attempt in your part to understand your own relationship with your mother?

40:30.052 --> 40:32.374
No, no, it wasn't.

40:33.836 --> 40:38.361
And I think I've been pretty consistent saying that.

40:40.183 --> 40:43.927
But I did that with Ellen Foster.

40:43.967 --> 40:46.951
I made peace with that relationship.

40:48.532 --> 40:52.697
And in the Fights and Sain, I wanted to write about

40:53.302 --> 41:00.010
a mother and a daughter who were estranged by this illness and who came back together.

41:01.251 --> 41:02.813
Isn't that right, Frank?

41:04.255 --> 41:12.744
But you said, not looking back, but looking forward to project how the girls might be.

41:14.206 --> 41:14.406
Yeah.

41:16.388 --> 41:22.195
Sometimes when I was writing this book, I would imagine my children 20 years from now

41:22.799 --> 41:33.170
And what they would say about me is the illness that I have, that the main character also has, got away with me, carried me away.

41:33.210 --> 41:37.154
And I could imagine how they would feel.

41:37.174 --> 41:45.343
So I would sit around and imagine the worst and write it down.

41:45.363 --> 41:48.326
But that does not occur.

41:48.526 --> 41:52.030
I couldn't be closer to those girls.

41:52.398 --> 41:53.960
But it is a what if.

41:56.222 --> 41:58.865
What if I forgot their birthdays?

41:59.666 --> 42:05.112
What if I didn't defend my son?

42:05.212 --> 42:05.793
What if?

42:09.116 --> 42:14.602
Did you have to do much research on mental illness?

42:14.743 --> 42:18.066
No, not at all on mental illness.

42:18.647 --> 42:21.510
I did research electroconvulsive therapy.

42:21.912 --> 42:31.866
because since it was written from the point of view of a doctor, I wanted to make sure I got the technical end of it correctly.

42:33.909 --> 42:42.021
And then just briefly, obviously relationships are a fundamental concern of yours.

42:42.041 --> 42:49.371
Is this something that we maybe can expose that, why that is an aspect we see in?

42:49.840 --> 42:55.468
I think so.

42:55.488 --> 43:15.414
I think that it's one of the... I think writing about the way we treat each other is as important as writing about the mysteries of the human heart.

43:16.095 --> 43:18.278
And those are really...

43:18.798 --> 43:27.109
only two things that I know how to do, so I'm sure I'll continue to do them.

43:27.750 --> 43:32.497
But I do want to hurry and get back to a book with history in it.

43:32.577 --> 43:34.560
I really missed history this time.

43:35.741 --> 43:36.002
That's great.

43:36.022 --> 43:39.546
And I read someplace that you said reading Marquez helped you?

43:39.627 --> 43:41.389
Yes, certainly did.

43:41.409 --> 43:47.978
As a matter of fact, I need to start back on A Hundred Years of Solitude.

43:48.565 --> 43:50.947
How specifically did that help you?

43:50.967 --> 44:09.986
I learned how to use detail, how the way light falls on the floor can create a mood for an entire scene.

44:12.569 --> 44:15.552
And also I learned how to use magic

44:16.223 --> 44:21.268
And I always toy a little bit with that in my stories.

44:21.288 --> 44:24.812
And this, not for my piece, but have you heard Mary Carr's book?

44:24.832 --> 44:26.914
That patron, The Liar's Club?

44:27.414 --> 44:28.556
I just got it.

44:28.576 --> 44:30.658
Someone sent it and I haven't read it yet.

44:30.678 --> 44:33.200
Very interesting.

44:33.220 --> 44:33.321
Yeah.

44:33.341 --> 44:40.468
It is a, you know, a global relationship.

44:40.488 --> 44:40.628
Mm-hmm.

44:41.570 --> 44:43.192
Well, I'm not going to take up any more of your time.

44:43.212 --> 44:44.173
Well, thank you.

44:44.213 --> 44:50.802
I want to give you this recommendation for you, although you've probably read it, Correlli's Mandolin.

44:51.162 --> 44:52.083
Oh, that's wonderful.

44:52.304 --> 44:52.464
Yeah.

44:53.225 --> 44:53.886
Wonderful book.

44:54.366 --> 44:57.230
And I wish to have gotten more attention than it did.

44:58.231 --> 45:07.002
I started Joseph Heller, came to Raleigh at Carrie's invitation last year.

45:08.324 --> 45:09.045
I asked him,

45:09.785 --> 45:19.299
because I spent the time in Greece, and we were talking about Catch-22, and he recommended it.

45:19.439 --> 45:30.115
He did a, and I did a pretty nice interview with him last year in New York on the sequel to Catch-22, which I liked.

45:30.135 --> 45:30.876
Oh, me too.

45:31.236 --> 45:31.577
I did.

45:32.098 --> 45:35.523
I mean, I liked, actually, I liked most of his work.

45:36.204 --> 45:39.268
And the poor man had the...
