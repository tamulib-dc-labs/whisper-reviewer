WEBVTT

00:02.444 --> 00:04.747
Every time there was a sale, I'd call him up.

00:04.828 --> 00:05.769
Let's start again.

00:05.789 --> 00:07.471
It's still the letter of the flannable collection.

00:07.512 --> 00:09.555
It's gone out of it with Kenyon's death, really.

00:09.875 --> 00:14.241
Because we became very friendly, rivals.

00:14.282 --> 00:15.884
In fact, we weren't rivals anymore.

00:15.904 --> 00:17.687
If he wanted something, I'd let him have it.

00:17.707 --> 00:19.389
And the same was true of me.

00:19.409 --> 00:20.711
And we brought some items together.

00:20.791 --> 00:22.414
One of our little stories, I'll show it to you.

00:24.877 --> 00:29.464
I have a Diffin's manuscript.

00:32.971 --> 01:02.910
here's a complete nine-page manuscript of one of dickens's short stories and this came up i'm holding it because you know that this is part of this jewel for me you know as i hold these things and it's uh well this came up at the uh at the joy sale and

01:05.152 --> 01:08.216
I had bought Murders in the Room, Warren.

01:08.236 --> 01:15.427
Kenyon was saving his money to buy a Trollope Management, and he was prepared to pay $35,000 for the Trollope Management.

01:15.447 --> 01:21.876
Well, as you know, auctions come up alphabetically, so Kenyon didn't bid on anything before the Trollope.

01:21.896 --> 01:23.779
And when the Trollope came up, he didn't get it.

01:25.321 --> 01:32.712
So I went to Kenyon afterwards, and I said, Kenyon, you know, you didn't get anything, and maybe we should

01:33.248 --> 01:36.852
talked to some of the dealers that bought things, and maybe we could find something we could buy.

01:36.872 --> 01:50.126
So we talked to Hamelenbacher, who had bought this, and they bought it for, I don't know what they bought it for, but they didn't have a client, and they wanted $18,000 for it.

01:53.290 --> 02:02.800
So Kenyon and I bought it together, and I went to Hamelenbacher, and I said, we're going to buy it for $18,000, and I will send you a check for $9,000, and Kenyon will send you a check for $9,000.

02:03.455 --> 02:10.344
And she patted, and she said, oh, oh dear, she said, it's one of the only Dickens manuscript that's complete in itself.

02:10.364 --> 02:12.887
She said, you're not going to break it out.

02:12.907 --> 02:14.369
And I said, we're not going to break it out.

02:14.730 --> 02:17.594
I said, he has custody, and I have visitation rights.

02:18.214 --> 02:22.260
You know what I love?

02:22.280 --> 02:24.062
This has canyons, rope plates.

02:24.515 --> 02:28.602
as your book plate, and then this is the provenance here.

02:28.782 --> 02:29.984
Whose book plate is that?

02:30.204 --> 02:32.989
Well, that's probably from the Susan A. Say, I'm not sure who that is.

02:33.489 --> 02:33.830
Let's see.

02:33.870 --> 02:35.152
No, this is Bixby.

02:35.192 --> 02:36.134
This is Bixby.

02:36.374 --> 02:37.416
Wasn't that Joyce?

02:37.576 --> 02:40.701
No, this was, well, yeah, this was in the Joyce sale, but they didn't.

02:40.721 --> 02:42.885
But see, it is a complete dimension.

02:42.905 --> 02:44.307
You're building a Dickens manuscript.

02:44.527 --> 02:48.173
So Bill, so Kenyon, was a deal with that one.

02:48.193 --> 02:50.016
That's pretty expensive, right?

02:50.671 --> 02:53.395
Now, you've got the goose pimples, right?

02:53.535 --> 02:54.437
It happens.

02:54.617 --> 03:05.072
Well, Kenyon and I, after that, bought other things together, and when he died, of course, we got him all back, and we knew he would go back.

03:05.413 --> 03:17.370
It was interesting, because we had given him little items of Dickens for birthdays and whatnot, and he kept meticulous things.

03:18.346 --> 03:29.738
a record of every book he had, what he paid, what he bought it, what other things had sold for his, anything that we had given him.

03:30.058 --> 03:37.947
He wrote in that book, we didn't know this until after his death, that it belonged in the South Library.

03:38.447 --> 03:45.855
So the building, he couldn't bear the harvest of all these taxes.

03:46.308 --> 03:52.374
So he would take these skits and write in there that they were just on loan from the South Library.

03:52.694 --> 03:56.238
So you actually, it's like some people might go fishing together.

03:56.498 --> 03:58.020
You'd collect them together.

03:58.600 --> 03:59.962
Oh yeah, we've always compared notes.

04:00.822 --> 04:06.608
And I always felt relieved when he didn't want something I did because I felt so obligated to let him have it if he wanted it.

04:06.728 --> 04:08.490
So there was no competition at all?

04:08.650 --> 04:10.172
Not after we knew each other.

04:10.192 --> 04:10.612
No.

04:10.632 --> 04:13.635
Well, there was sometimes a little secret.

04:13.655 --> 04:15.657
When this brought me out,

04:16.109 --> 04:17.511
Wuthering Heights came up.

04:18.072 --> 04:19.594
Bill was dying to have it.

04:20.355 --> 04:28.846
And Kenyon was with us, and Bill was kind of holding back to see if Kenyon wanted the book, and he looked at it.

04:29.788 --> 04:34.394
He said, you know, it's just such a lousy copy.

04:34.995 --> 04:36.657
But here it was with all this.

04:36.697 --> 04:38.540
The notes and everything in it.

04:38.560 --> 04:39.401
So anyway.

04:39.441 --> 04:42.125
Let's go over and look some things if you're ready to do that.

04:42.145 --> 04:42.726
Sure.

04:42.746 --> 04:43.907
Put this over here.

04:43.927 --> 04:45.289
We'll start over here, but we haven't.

04:45.522 --> 04:58.778
I'm going to put my pen away, too, because when I go near rare things... Okay.

04:58.798 --> 05:04.264
Okay, we'll start here.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.427
This is the single rare book I have.

05:07.368 --> 05:11.833
And this is the four-timer library thing.

05:20.099 --> 05:20.820
This is Alice.

05:22.342 --> 05:24.004
Now, these are the people.

05:24.866 --> 05:28.651
Her name is Harriet Borland, B-O-R-L-A-D.

05:29.232 --> 05:31.495
She got it directly from the Forsheimer Library.

05:31.635 --> 05:33.237
I got it after she did.

05:33.898 --> 05:40.487
As you may know about this book, the distinguishing is the 65.

05:40.687 --> 05:47.697
There's a new book out, I don't know if you've seen it, called The Consensus, that Justin Triller put out, and it tells where every copy is.

05:48.138 --> 05:52.885
Maybe if Connie were on this side of you and me, she could see it at the same time.

05:53.406 --> 06:04.562
But this copy belonged to, I never know how to pronounce your name, one of the little girls he photographed, and I have pictures of you.

06:04.602 --> 06:05.063
Alice Liddell?

06:05.283 --> 06:05.604
No.

06:05.844 --> 06:08.668
She's Alice.

06:09.020 --> 06:11.243
Kitchen, X-I-E Kitchen.

06:11.263 --> 06:16.812
She was one of his favorite photographic models, and I have some pictures of her that he took.

06:16.832 --> 06:17.513
This was her book.

06:17.533 --> 06:18.374
He had given it to her.

06:18.394 --> 06:24.764
And then when she died, it came on the market, and of course I don't have bought it.

06:24.784 --> 06:31.634
This is a... This is the copy I bought at the same time.

06:32.716 --> 06:37.643
I think this is the copy I bought at the same time, which is such a very good condition.

06:38.753 --> 06:43.097
Yeah, it's a much better condition than that one.

06:43.117 --> 06:44.218
And this has a letter.

06:44.298 --> 06:45.459
My dear Edith.

06:45.479 --> 06:48.342
Yes, from Lewis Carroll.

06:49.323 --> 06:49.803
Lewis Carroll.

06:50.664 --> 06:53.087
He signed Lewis Carroll as opposed to Dodgson.

06:53.147 --> 06:54.808
He signed differently.

06:54.948 --> 06:59.212
I one time had a chance to buy one copy where he signed it both ways and sent a copy.

06:59.673 --> 07:01.194
And I didn't buy it.

07:01.715 --> 07:04.337
But see, now this is... Oh, look at the condition of that.

07:04.357 --> 07:05.098
This is great condition.

07:06.293 --> 07:07.875
No clocks on this one.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.176
Now see, this is the 66.

07:09.336 --> 07:14.581
This is the one that came out after that one.

07:14.601 --> 07:17.724
And then this one, which is a looking glass.

07:21.788 --> 07:28.415
This is the original drawing by Tenille.

07:29.096 --> 07:32.419
This was, I don't know how you say Tenille or Tenille,

07:32.990 --> 07:36.976
But Tennille, he put that drawing in, I think.

07:37.477 --> 07:38.779
Is that a laid-in drawing?

07:38.799 --> 07:39.780
No, he drew it.

07:39.800 --> 07:40.461
It's an original.

07:40.481 --> 07:41.703
Oh, that's an original drawing.

07:41.723 --> 07:53.120
Let's say for the sake of what we have here, that this is through the looking glass with an original pencil drawing by Tennille on the title page and also with a Christmas inscription.

07:53.180 --> 07:55.123
And that is duplicated on page 184.

08:00.371 --> 08:00.972
Wow.

08:01.610 --> 08:04.594
Dickens.

08:04.614 --> 08:05.716
We'll stay with Dickens for a minute.

08:05.736 --> 08:08.680
He just looked at the management of the best authority.

08:08.740 --> 08:17.733
This is a very amusing article in that Dickens says in all of his life, every time he gets into an argument, someone says, I have it on the best authority, that so-and-so is true.

08:18.354 --> 08:20.317
And he says, I've never met the best authority.

08:20.357 --> 08:22.400
Who is this fellow named the best authority?

08:22.420 --> 08:23.381
That's what that's all about.

08:23.922 --> 08:25.404
This is a terrific item.

08:25.424 --> 08:27.347
This was Kenyon's.

08:27.367 --> 08:30.351
And it was one of the highlights of the Susan A. Sale.

08:30.955 --> 08:31.996
How do we spell that?

08:33.098 --> 08:33.839
I'll show you.

08:33.979 --> 08:34.760
I'll show you.

08:34.780 --> 08:36.161
I think it may have a book fight in it.

08:37.283 --> 08:40.827
If it isn't, I've got it around here somewhere.

08:40.847 --> 08:44.151
Was this one of the items that the Kenyan left to you?

08:45.773 --> 08:45.853
Yes.

08:45.873 --> 08:46.554
There's the duel.

08:46.795 --> 08:49.718
I might have to take a picture of the two books.

08:49.738 --> 08:51.701
Here's the one.

08:51.721 --> 08:52.402
He was a counter.

08:52.422 --> 08:55.045
Oh, okay.

08:56.807 --> 08:57.768
It is important.

08:57.828 --> 08:58.689
That's where you met.

08:59.090 --> 08:59.831
That's how you met.

08:59.851 --> 09:00.051
Yeah.

09:00.672 --> 09:02.234
Alain, A-L-A-I-N.

09:02.454 --> 09:02.574
Right.

09:03.856 --> 09:04.657
And that is D-E-N.

09:04.677 --> 09:05.919
D-E, right.

09:06.419 --> 09:07.060
S-U-Z.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.061
S-U-Z.

09:08.642 --> 09:09.623
A-N-N-E-T.

09:10.284 --> 09:10.905
A-N-N-E-T.

09:11.846 --> 09:14.449
Maybe the foremost Dickens' collection is French.

09:16.652 --> 09:25.443
Here's what's his own copy of... This is Dickens' own copy of... And this, of course, was his American Publisher's technique.

09:26.424 --> 09:28.907
And you see, this is...

09:29.478 --> 09:31.020
Dickens inscribed it.

09:32.442 --> 09:35.205
He always gave that little flair there, didn't he?

09:35.265 --> 09:43.395
And he did his own adding of what he wanted to leave in and take out or emphasize as he gave his reading.

09:44.616 --> 09:45.657
This is his own copy?

09:45.718 --> 09:46.819
Yes, this is Dickens' own copy.

09:46.839 --> 09:52.726
This is Dickens' own, let's say it, this is Dickens' own annotated copy of Mrs. Camp, I believe, right?

09:52.746 --> 09:53.527
Yes.

09:53.547 --> 09:55.149
From which he gave his readings.

09:55.189 --> 09:57.612
He gave quite a few in Worcester, by the way.

09:57.772 --> 09:58.573
Oh, dear.

10:00.207 --> 10:05.693
This here.

10:08.456 --> 10:10.057
This is great.

10:11.339 --> 10:15.923
This is the earliest I mentioned, the earliest known description on the Christmas carol.

10:16.384 --> 10:17.525
The earliest known.

10:19.948 --> 10:24.072
And that is also from the...

10:25.334 --> 10:28.097
This is the 17th of December, 1843.

10:29.038 --> 10:36.887
Now, I think my impression he did, I have the records around here somewhere, he did about five or six copies, I think, on that date, but none before.

10:38.389 --> 10:42.834
It's interesting also, you know, there's a big dispute about whether it should be yellow end papers or green end papers.

10:43.615 --> 10:48.000
Every inscribed copy in the early, we're all on yellow end papers.

10:48.908 --> 10:54.276
It seems to me if you have the earliest inscribed coffee, it's quite irrelevant.

10:54.717 --> 11:04.992
Now, to show you the depth of some of them, I think, if you kind of turn around, these are all Christmas cards.

11:05.012 --> 11:05.633
Oh, wow.

11:05.653 --> 11:06.515
In various forms.

11:06.595 --> 11:07.937
The 11th edition.

11:07.957 --> 11:11.122
Most of them are, this is the 11th edition.

11:11.142 --> 11:13.345
Some people consider very rare.

11:14.086 --> 11:15.608
Most of them are first.

11:15.648 --> 11:18.072
This one is, this is inscribed to

11:18.912 --> 11:19.973
That's an inscribed copy.

11:19.993 --> 11:20.954
What's this here?

11:22.756 --> 11:24.999
Oh, this tells all about the Christmas carol.

11:26.420 --> 11:28.783
This is the study of the Christmas carol.

11:29.003 --> 11:33.508
This tells about the date that the first one was inscribed and so forth.

11:33.528 --> 11:35.990
So these are all Christmas carols.

11:37.112 --> 11:39.134
What have I got?

11:39.154 --> 11:40.535
Did I take care of that?

11:40.575 --> 11:44.720
Oh, this is a non-commercial traveler.

11:47.463 --> 11:48.784
It's not a first edition.

11:49.895 --> 11:52.999
But it is inscribed to George Eliot.

11:54.822 --> 11:57.465
The Uncommercial Traveler.

11:57.485 --> 12:01.070
Second edition right there.

12:01.230 --> 12:11.865
You know, the whole concept of a first edition really is almost a 20th century... Well, I'm sure that, you know, he just gave it to her without... Without even thinking about it.

12:11.885 --> 12:14.248
It didn't make any difference to him when it was the first or second, I'm sure.

12:16.253 --> 12:18.697
You got that through a dealer or a sale?

12:18.717 --> 12:22.943
That actually was also from, that came from John Fleming.

12:24.666 --> 12:28.291
This is a page of manuscript from Pickwick Papers.

12:28.852 --> 12:30.094
What happened with this?

12:31.876 --> 12:41.651
In the Susan A. sale, there were 13 pages of Pickwick, and John Fleming sold as a unit.

12:43.234 --> 12:44.235
John Fleming bought them.

12:44.958 --> 12:47.341
and then split them up and sold them individually.

12:47.521 --> 12:48.442
How do you feel about that?

12:49.122 --> 12:55.990
Well, in a way, I think this page now, the last time this page sold, that auction went for about $20,000.

12:56.110 --> 13:01.055
I understand, but don't you think that... So I could never afford to have the 13 pages.

13:01.075 --> 13:03.498
As a collector, you... Well, and that wasn't complete.

13:03.578 --> 13:04.358
And it wasn't complete anyway.

13:04.378 --> 13:05.319
It wasn't complete to begin with.

13:05.360 --> 13:06.200
It wasn't complete to begin with.

13:06.220 --> 13:07.081
That's the importance.

13:07.121 --> 13:10.485
I think that's probably the point.

13:10.505 --> 13:12.467
But it did permit me to...

13:12.953 --> 13:15.497
to get something I would normally not be able to get.

13:15.517 --> 13:20.927
This came from a cinching story, a personal story about this.

13:21.367 --> 13:28.800
This belonged to a gentleman in Los Angeles named Paul Francis Webster, who was a lyricist.

13:28.820 --> 13:35.371
And we visited his home once, only once, and I saw this in his home, never dreaming that I would someday own it.

13:36.152 --> 13:37.695
Then Webster died.

13:38.350 --> 13:40.592
Yeah, well, there's his book, Paul Fenton.

13:40.652 --> 13:45.778
Yeah, and this sold in New York.

13:46.178 --> 13:47.660
He had a wonderful collection.

13:47.740 --> 13:48.781
I have his catalog.

13:49.101 --> 13:50.883
Lots of wonderful collections, too.

13:50.903 --> 13:53.386
Hans Christian Andersen, from his friend and admirer.

13:53.506 --> 13:58.231
This is inscribed to Hans Christian Andersen in the Pickford Papers, Dickens.

13:58.751 --> 13:58.992
Wow.

14:00.713 --> 14:01.935
Did you get that at the sale, though?

14:02.155 --> 14:06.740
I bought that at a sale, because the Webster sale was fairly recent.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.121
Yeah, it wasn't too long ago, two years ago.

14:09.012 --> 14:11.655
This is just such a rare book.

14:13.397 --> 14:15.179
He sold that library, I believe.

14:15.239 --> 14:16.600
Oh, Francis Webster, no.

14:16.620 --> 14:17.541
No, his estate sold it.

14:17.561 --> 14:17.861
Really?

14:17.901 --> 14:18.362
Yeah.

14:18.382 --> 14:18.782
He died.

14:18.862 --> 14:19.423
That's correct.

14:19.443 --> 14:21.765
Yeah, it's quite a, it's a very moving forward.

14:21.785 --> 14:23.327
This, again, was Kenyon's copy.

14:24.048 --> 14:27.692
See what condition of a very, very rare book.

14:28.052 --> 14:30.455
It almost looks like you, you, you.

14:30.475 --> 14:32.637
We did it from the same company.

14:32.657 --> 14:35.560
What, what he, you see, our little secrets.

14:35.894 --> 14:39.799
His has, if you look at it, a starling, a bird, in his.

14:40.340 --> 14:46.669
Mine is in the shape of a television screen, without saying that.

14:46.689 --> 14:47.570
Yeah, yeah.

14:47.590 --> 14:48.651
Mine's in the shape of a television screen.

14:48.671 --> 14:49.232
But we had them both done.

14:49.252 --> 14:50.514
We're talking about the book plates here.

14:51.115 --> 14:51.215
Okay.

14:51.335 --> 14:54.319
Now, I have two copies of this.

14:54.399 --> 14:57.363
My copy is, that's where I have the duplicates.

14:57.383 --> 14:59.466
It's Kenyon's library duplicates of mine.

14:59.486 --> 15:01.910
This copy is actually a little nicer than my copy.

15:01.930 --> 15:02.931
You can see it's brighter.

15:03.265 --> 15:05.308
Give me an idea of your time schedule.

15:05.629 --> 15:06.170
Oh, I'm all right.

15:06.270 --> 15:07.833
We're fine.

15:07.893 --> 15:11.258
I just don't want to be imposing on any plans that you have.

15:11.278 --> 15:15.145
When I fall asleep, you know, I just... Okay.

15:15.165 --> 15:16.046
Move along.

15:16.086 --> 15:16.407
No, no, no.

15:16.447 --> 15:23.379
I mean, we're fine, but I don't want to feel that we're... One of the books I sold in regret is that I had... You sold a book.

15:23.699 --> 15:24.520
I sold one book.

15:24.741 --> 15:26.123
I had... Well, I've actually sold two.

15:26.143 --> 15:27.265
I had a copy of the...

15:28.072 --> 15:29.034
What was the book we sold?

15:30.897 --> 15:31.878
Kelmscott Chaucer.

15:32.299 --> 15:34.322
The Kelmscott Chaucer?

15:34.783 --> 15:37.748
Well, why in the world would you sell a Kelmscott Chaucer?

15:37.768 --> 15:39.410
I had a Kelmscott Chaucer.

15:39.430 --> 15:39.871
In vellum.

15:39.891 --> 15:40.933
Don't tell me it was in vellum.

15:40.953 --> 15:43.437
It was in vellum, but it was in the pigskin binding.

15:43.457 --> 15:44.499
The white pigskin binding.

15:44.539 --> 15:45.881
You'd like to have that back, I'll bet.

15:46.221 --> 15:49.166
I bought it for $10,000 and sold it for $20,000.

15:49.266 --> 15:52.291
It didn't fit in with my literature.

15:52.351 --> 15:54.435
You know, we're authors and stuff.

15:54.455 --> 15:55.176
And I finally...

15:55.696 --> 15:59.641
And it was such a big book, you know, to really look at.

16:00.402 --> 16:01.584
But I sold it.

16:01.604 --> 16:05.148
Anyway, I had a third, first edition of Great Expectations.

16:06.290 --> 16:08.292
And it was kind of a beat-up, lousy copy.

16:08.613 --> 16:09.854
And I had these two better copies.

16:10.656 --> 16:11.336
So I sold it.

16:11.597 --> 16:12.918
And I've been sorry ever since.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.802
Because it has become such a rare book.

16:16.904 --> 16:17.364
What is this?

16:17.524 --> 16:18.726
Did we look at this?

16:18.746 --> 16:20.629
Yes.

16:20.649 --> 16:23.352
If we turn around, and we'll get back to anything you want to.

16:23.392 --> 16:25.635
This is one of my favorite books.

16:26.189 --> 16:32.557
This is also an inscribed copy.

16:34.519 --> 16:36.401
Let me see what it is.

16:36.561 --> 16:42.508
I think the copy itself is inscribed, too, but it has this letter in it, which I will read to you in a minute.

16:45.452 --> 16:48.175
It's also inscribed from Charles Dickens.

16:48.195 --> 16:51.319
Is that what his name is?

16:57.087 --> 17:05.696
Dickens' own copy of David Copperfield presented to J-L-R-I-C-K-A-R-D-S, Rickards, with a presentation inscription.

17:06.737 --> 17:20.291
He says, I wish to preserve between us some little outward and visible remembrance of your generous Mexican adventure, the adventure for which I was unconsciously responsible.

17:20.791 --> 17:22.453
No one I know knows what that's all about.

17:23.108 --> 17:33.644
And he goes on to say, will you do me the favor to accept my own copy of a book for which I have a particular affection, in the assurance that you will like it none the worse for coming from my own study shelves.

17:34.244 --> 17:38.190
I beg you to accept it with my thanks and good wishes, Charles Dickens.

17:38.631 --> 17:42.316
Dare I ask what you had to pay for this?

17:42.737 --> 17:49.487
You may ask, and I can't answer it, because it came from Kenyon, and I don't remember what he paid for it.

17:50.480 --> 18:01.675
But I would say, it's certainly because it came off of Dickens' shelf, and he says so, that it's a very valuable book.

18:01.695 --> 18:07.984
Kenyon bought his books for the most part before they... Well, that's true.

18:08.004 --> 18:10.868
Dickens really hasn't been on the top for a long time.

18:11.135 --> 18:15.279
That must have been quite a moment for you when you actually put your book plate in the book.

18:15.419 --> 18:15.760
Oh, yes, it was.

18:15.820 --> 18:17.041
Next to his book plate.

18:17.061 --> 18:18.863
I wonder if you could tell me a little bit about that.

18:18.883 --> 18:20.265
That must have been a moment, actually.

18:20.285 --> 18:21.045
It was a moment.

18:21.586 --> 18:27.092
And not without some pluses and minuses.

18:27.132 --> 18:30.275
You know, maybe in a way I didn't want to do it.

18:30.355 --> 18:32.157
In a way I did want to do it.

18:32.177 --> 18:32.758
But anyway.

18:33.218 --> 18:34.419
But let's go on with me.

18:34.560 --> 18:36.121
Away from Dickens, we'll come back to him.

18:36.522 --> 18:39.825
You see, I have, again, Oliver Twist in parts, very rare.

18:40.177 --> 18:43.101
but I have two copies, and I also have presentation copies.

18:43.141 --> 18:44.203
Here's two presentations.

18:44.683 --> 18:51.212
Here's to MacReady and Oliver Twist, and here's to William Harris and Ainsworth.

18:51.252 --> 18:52.254
Have you had all these made?

18:53.075 --> 18:56.319
No, some of them I have made, and some of them just came that way.

18:57.160 --> 19:00.445
Moving on to another author, Poe.

19:00.465 --> 19:01.587
Are you enjoying this, by the way?

19:01.687 --> 19:03.149
Yeah, I do enjoy it, yeah.

19:03.169 --> 19:05.472
This is Mike Tamerlane.

19:06.213 --> 19:09.137
As you may know, for reasons that I don't know,

19:09.758 --> 19:15.284
Somebody cut a V in two places on this book.

19:16.084 --> 19:21.930
Some people guess that they did it to prevent anyone stealing it.

19:25.073 --> 19:29.398
But as you can see, there's a little V before and here.

19:32.461 --> 19:38.787
May I just... Well, the thing that probably makes it so rare...

19:39.188 --> 19:40.289
Tamerlane.

19:40.649 --> 19:41.430
Do you hear that tape?

19:43.092 --> 19:47.977
That's the black tulip of the American Antiquarian Society doesn't own one of these.

19:49.038 --> 19:50.399
It's a rare book.

19:51.060 --> 19:52.521
The reasons are probably many.

19:52.682 --> 19:58.047
One is that he didn't sell a copy of it that they know of, and two, it doesn't have his name on it.

19:58.067 --> 20:02.131
So if you found this in the attic, poems by a Bostonian, you'd probably toss it out.

20:02.331 --> 20:03.853
One, in fact, was found in Worcester.

20:04.113 --> 20:05.955
Yes, one was found.

20:06.475 --> 20:08.738
1827, he was a youngster.

20:08.838 --> 20:16.390
Now, there are some poems in the back of... Ballarat and Tamaline and whatever that... other poems.

20:16.770 --> 20:18.353
I have the manuscript on some of those.

20:18.373 --> 20:18.873
I'll show you.

20:18.893 --> 20:21.537
When you got this, did you take it home to California with you?

20:21.898 --> 20:22.318
No.

20:22.338 --> 20:23.660
I had to go through all the rigamarole.

20:23.680 --> 20:25.102
I had to go through all the rigamarole.

20:25.183 --> 20:29.409
I had to pay... shipping and insurance to ship it off.

20:29.549 --> 20:30.530
$700.

20:30.691 --> 20:32.874
Was it to ship it to insure it?

20:33.395 --> 20:35.638
Then, of course, I had to pay California's tax on it.

20:35.855 --> 20:36.275
Why?

20:37.376 --> 20:39.118
Because I'm a Californian.

20:39.138 --> 20:40.379
No, but you bought it in New York.

20:40.419 --> 20:41.821
It doesn't work anymore.

20:41.841 --> 20:43.222
You now have to pay the tax.

20:43.242 --> 20:43.923
They've got you now.

20:44.523 --> 20:45.484
They won't release it to you.

20:45.664 --> 20:48.627
Unless you pay New York tax, which is more than California.

20:48.887 --> 20:52.451
They won't release it to you until you show a form that you've paid the tax.

20:52.471 --> 20:53.572
Six and a half, yeah.

20:53.592 --> 20:57.676
So what started out at $150,000 ended up at $170,000.

20:58.456 --> 21:03.081
So you had to do the 10% freemium and then everything else.

21:03.161 --> 21:03.821
That's exciting.

21:03.901 --> 21:04.562
This book...

21:05.943 --> 21:11.830
Murders in the Rue Morgue is interesting because there's a mystery connected with it, which I'm trying to solve.

21:18.138 --> 21:33.958
This has a, on the wrapper, it's the prose romances, Murders in the Rue Morgue and the Man that We Used Up, and the Philadelphia Publisher in 1843 was George B. Zeber, Z-I-E-B-E-R, and company.

21:34.428 --> 21:37.772
No other copy has the Zebra publisher.

21:38.273 --> 21:47.765
Most of them that are known, they're only, you know, five or six or seven or eight or nine, whatever they are, have either no wrappers at all or they have what they call the Graham wrapper.

21:48.446 --> 21:55.835
This copy also has a couple of little editor's pencil marks in it, which Poe was known to do.

21:56.496 --> 21:57.858
I'm not saying he did this copy.

21:59.400 --> 22:03.625
What we do know is that George Zebra...

22:03.757 --> 22:10.183
Poe wrote a letter to a publisher saying, I'm sending you some of my works through my agent, George Zebra.

22:10.203 --> 22:13.826
So we know that Poe knew him, so that much is established.

22:13.846 --> 22:16.329
We also know that Zebra published a lot of books.

22:16.349 --> 22:19.251
There just isn't any proof that he published this one.

22:19.852 --> 22:20.753
What's your guess, Taylor?

22:20.953 --> 22:21.774
Randall.

22:21.794 --> 22:22.154
Randall.

22:22.494 --> 22:25.217
Well, David Randall, who I'm sure you probably know that name.

22:25.237 --> 22:31.823
David Randall, when told of this copy, wrote in his book,

22:32.596 --> 22:33.617
which I have somewhat.

22:33.637 --> 22:35.159
That dupt him large enough.

22:35.740 --> 22:38.623
That this was a phony, not a real copy.

22:39.724 --> 22:51.117
And when the George people decided to auction the book, they got a hold of David Randall and said, we don't want to auction the book until we know its authenticity.

22:51.658 --> 22:52.559
Would you examine it?

22:52.779 --> 22:53.660
And he did examine it.

22:53.700 --> 22:55.002
And then he wrote an apology.

22:55.583 --> 23:00.308
And he said, never again will I ever brand the book phony,

23:00.524 --> 23:01.566
that I haven't examined.

23:01.586 --> 23:03.889
He said, it's absolutely... Oh, he hasn't examined it?

23:03.949 --> 23:04.790
He had never seen it.

23:05.071 --> 23:06.333
That's not good.

23:06.353 --> 23:09.357
He came up to the real book business, too, before he went out.

23:09.417 --> 23:11.981
So we have his letter saying that it is authentic.

23:12.061 --> 23:13.764
He doesn't understand Graham's title page.

23:14.225 --> 23:15.547
No one does.

23:15.927 --> 23:16.768
Well, there are two theories.

23:17.069 --> 23:21.055
One is that Poe gave it to Graham, nobody ever bought it, and he switched to Zebra.

23:21.215 --> 23:26.503
Or he gave it to Zebra, nobody ever bought it, and then he switched to Graham.

23:26.523 --> 23:28.506
Or Graham or Zebra

23:28.958 --> 23:31.841
Just took it upon themselves to put a title page on.

23:31.861 --> 23:35.144
Is this stuff that you've researched yourself?

23:35.164 --> 23:36.446
Yes, I've done a lot of research on it.

23:36.846 --> 23:38.428
I haven't solved it.

23:38.448 --> 23:51.221
Here's my Raven and Rappers, the companion copy that went in the soil with the last big sale in New York, which sold somewhere near $50,000, I think.

23:52.142 --> 23:56.687
But this is the Raven and other poems in the Rappers.

23:59.030 --> 24:04.938
See, the whole suggestion that the paperback is an invention of after World War II, isn't it?

24:04.958 --> 24:09.965
It's a wonder they exist at all.

24:09.985 --> 24:13.129
In that state, which is extraordinary, 150 years old.

24:13.269 --> 24:14.611
There's nothing terribly unusual.

24:14.631 --> 24:18.677
This is just a tale of the grotesque in arabesque, which is a nice copy.

24:18.697 --> 24:20.499
This was from the Strader collection.

24:21.641 --> 24:22.462
Stralem.

24:24.404 --> 24:25.426
S-T-R-A-L-E-M.

24:25.826 --> 24:27.028
That's Donald S.

24:27.329 --> 24:31.875
Yes, this is just a... Is that booklet leather, by the way?

24:32.156 --> 24:33.117
Looks like it.

24:33.137 --> 24:33.237
Yeah.

24:33.938 --> 24:34.439
I mean yours.

24:34.619 --> 24:34.960
Oh, mine?

24:34.980 --> 24:35.781
No, mine is paper.

24:35.921 --> 24:38.605
It looks like leather, doesn't it?

24:38.625 --> 24:40.167
This is some management material.

24:40.507 --> 24:52.324
Here's the two little poems that were in... Let's see... Two of the other was in Burton's magazine.

24:56.725 --> 24:58.007
Oh, here's what it says.

25:02.593 --> 25:06.659
Oh, this is in the hands of Chicago College.

25:06.679 --> 25:12.247
That's a whole manuscript.

25:12.267 --> 25:14.270
These columns are in Al-A-Rap, I think.

25:15.332 --> 25:16.053
Oh, where?

25:16.113 --> 25:17.354
In Al-A-Rap, I want to look at that.

25:17.374 --> 25:18.075
Another time, yeah.

25:19.277 --> 25:24.825
I saw the young night bright all day, when a burning blush came, or the

25:25.244 --> 25:27.387
And then the other one on the right is To the River.

25:27.627 --> 25:29.229
Okay, can we just put the titles again?

25:29.269 --> 25:34.835
This is in an album with the numeral 32, two with a line.

25:35.816 --> 25:38.139
I saw the All Night Bridal Days, the first line of that one.

25:38.980 --> 25:40.041
And this is To the River.

25:40.983 --> 25:44.226
Fair River, exclamation, and Thy Bright Clear Flow.

25:44.507 --> 25:49.613
That's pretty nice.

25:50.073 --> 25:53.277
I guess the serious collector inevitably has to get into manuscripts.

25:53.459 --> 25:54.720
Yeah, I think you do.

25:54.741 --> 25:56.443
Well, you know, it's nice to have something personal.

25:56.963 --> 25:57.964
This is a Poe letter.

26:00.007 --> 26:01.889
Very fragile.

26:01.909 --> 26:06.494
This is to Dr. Snodgrass or somebody like that.

26:06.935 --> 26:10.739
But it's really falling apart, as you can see.

26:10.779 --> 26:15.805
You know, I'm impressed that you're not afraid to take these things out and handle them.

26:15.825 --> 26:17.107
Well, I don't take them out.

26:17.988 --> 26:20.451
Well, I must tell you, because they are so fragile.

26:21.111 --> 26:22.453
And then...

26:23.767 --> 26:35.362
You might want me to say this too, but you do keep the stuff in the vault.

26:35.382 --> 26:37.084
I do, yes.

26:37.845 --> 26:43.012
I keep most of the rare stuff in the vault and get it out when needed.

26:44.193 --> 26:50.922
This is for Annie, which I think is one of his greatest poems.

26:53.197 --> 26:55.140
This handwriting was beautiful, wasn't it?

26:55.501 --> 26:57.043
Now, this has eight stanzas.

26:57.143 --> 27:00.930
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

27:01.210 --> 27:02.933
The actual poem has, I think, 16.

27:03.794 --> 27:05.958
But the history of this particular copy is known.

27:06.058 --> 27:08.422
Poe sent this poem to the publisher.

27:09.624 --> 27:14.332
And somewhere along the line, half of it was lost.

27:15.093 --> 27:19.440
And all the books on Poe acknowledge that there's only one complete copy.

27:19.825 --> 27:21.828
which I think is in the Philadelphia Free Library.

27:21.848 --> 27:24.872
We're all 18, but this is the best you can do now.

27:24.932 --> 27:26.094
It's all with left.

27:26.114 --> 27:29.018
That's what it represents.

27:29.038 --> 27:34.066
And then this was the manuscript I bought that might have been considered a pony.

27:34.807 --> 27:45.482
And what we did, it has little holes here, you see, where a thread went through to bind it.

27:45.502 --> 27:47.605
And this little crease here, which was also...

27:48.192 --> 27:56.683
And all the copies in the bird collection and other collections that have this all have that same crease and those same holes in the same place.

27:56.783 --> 27:57.724
That's a New York problem.

27:57.744 --> 27:58.345
Yeah, yeah.

27:58.865 --> 27:59.646
This is page 11.

27:59.747 --> 28:09.539
I think, I'm not sure how many pages there were, but it is also known in all the reference books, see, that Pope broke this up and gave pages away to different people.

28:09.579 --> 28:13.784
So that's why, why it's, you know, there's no complete copy.

28:13.804 --> 28:15.246
When I sat with Bill Scheide,

28:15.496 --> 28:18.459
in Princeton, and he took out his Gutenberg Bible.

28:18.479 --> 28:19.741
We did a very similar thing.

28:19.761 --> 28:22.184
He said, I feel where the hole is.

28:22.304 --> 28:23.305
I said, you see that hole?

28:23.325 --> 28:24.606
That's really exactly the thing.

28:24.767 --> 28:32.335
Doing the same kind of a thing that you're doing right there, really knowing not only the content of the collection, but every aspect of it.

28:32.355 --> 28:33.737
Yeah, you have to do a little research on it.

28:33.757 --> 28:36.039
All right, we move to the Brontage.

28:36.820 --> 28:43.528
Here's Weather Heights in three volumes, Agnes Gray being the third.

28:43.795 --> 28:44.736
Now, this is the copy.

28:44.816 --> 28:51.685
Each one of these little pieces of paper marks something that Charlotte put in.

28:52.866 --> 28:54.889
Something that Charlotte put in.

28:57.432 --> 28:58.613
Are those her pieces of paper?

28:58.874 --> 28:59.014
No.

28:59.074 --> 28:59.975
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

29:00.015 --> 29:02.258
They're her notation, but they're not her pieces of paper.

29:02.698 --> 29:04.320
But most of them are very small, like here.

29:04.701 --> 29:07.184
She changed to T.O.

29:07.304 --> 29:09.667
to T.W.O., because it should be T.W.O.

29:10.188 --> 29:11.389
And she made these changes

29:11.791 --> 29:12.272
I believe.

29:12.652 --> 29:14.975
She goes, she spells it differently.

29:14.995 --> 29:20.923
She made the changes in preparation for the second edition, which she edited.

29:21.924 --> 29:23.606
And these are the changes that were questioned.

29:23.646 --> 29:29.874
And then I have since sent copies of the changes to the Rothery Museum.

29:30.074 --> 29:33.058
And they had several people over there examine them.

29:33.078 --> 29:38.845
And they wrote back and they said, in their mind, there's absolutely no question that it's Charlotte's handwriting.

29:39.566 --> 29:40.988
This may be one of the letters now.

29:42.149 --> 29:47.577
So any Bronte editor would be very interested in this, if you're bringing out a... Yes, yes.

29:48.098 --> 29:51.123
I get inquiries from people to come see.

29:52.946 --> 29:57.453
Oh, he said, I took up the question of the authorship and the annotations in your copy.

29:58.174 --> 30:09.692
Both Margaret Smith and Professor Kathleen Tilson, I've had a reply from both of these, pleased to know that they both confirm that they think the handwriting is definitely that of Charlotte Bronte's.

30:10.820 --> 30:14.486
It just annoys me that somebody challenges all these things and you have to kind of solve it.

30:14.506 --> 30:15.568
But if you solve it and write it.

30:15.588 --> 30:16.730
They don't know.

30:16.770 --> 30:17.651
No, that's part of it, though.

30:17.671 --> 30:18.653
That's kind of fun.

30:19.314 --> 30:21.858
This is a very rare thing.

30:21.878 --> 30:23.982
This is their first book of poems.

30:24.002 --> 30:26.186
There are two editions to this, as you may know.

30:26.226 --> 30:27.067
We have both.

30:28.189 --> 30:34.239
I have to remember this.

30:34.299 --> 30:36.743
This was a well-known death recording.

30:37.634 --> 30:40.418
Duff Gordon, is that my name?

30:40.558 --> 30:42.621
Yes, I think that's who that is.

30:42.641 --> 30:52.095
Anyway, this is, has a, how do you say that, and Jones, publisher, which is the rare one.

30:52.956 --> 30:56.742
And then they also, nobody bought this, I guess, and they changed publication.

30:56.802 --> 30:59.526
This is pretty good.

30:59.546 --> 31:01.589
150, close to 150 years old.

31:02.671 --> 31:07.017
This is a, this is a,

31:07.385 --> 31:10.048
couple of interesting items.

31:10.068 --> 31:11.629
Does Barbara still collect, by the way?

31:11.789 --> 31:12.970
A little bit.

31:12.990 --> 31:14.372
She hasn't got the means to do that.

31:14.392 --> 31:18.876
I brought her, she's been writing some travel articles, which have been published.

31:19.436 --> 31:22.579
There's a very nice one on Willa Cather's, Nebraska.

31:22.880 --> 31:25.742
And I brought it down to show you.

31:25.883 --> 31:33.310
This we bought at the Houghton sale in London, Arthur Houghton.

31:33.790 --> 31:36.252
Charlotte Bronte, autographed manuscript of two of her poems.

31:36.312 --> 31:36.953
I think she was

31:37.658 --> 31:39.520
13 or 14 years old when she wrote this.

31:40.381 --> 31:52.595
As you know, they wrote in the miniature hand.

31:52.615 --> 31:55.718
And this is Scarlet Bronte's miniature hand.

31:56.139 --> 32:03.227
And several experts have been here to examine this because in publishing these early poems,

32:03.781 --> 32:08.208
People couldn't read them right, or they, quote, improved upon them.

32:08.228 --> 32:09.850
I don't know whether this is any good or not.

32:11.413 --> 32:18.824
And here, in the back, someone has printed it, so at least you can sort of tell what... How could they write this for?

32:18.924 --> 32:20.006
I know, they were murderers.

32:20.026 --> 32:22.450
They had to use them, I think.

32:22.470 --> 32:25.194
Well, that was pretty authentic today.

32:25.214 --> 32:27.057
I'm sure that that's authentic.

32:27.177 --> 32:29.541
Thank you.

32:29.821 --> 32:30.362
And then...

32:33.160 --> 32:35.062
This is Emily's diary.

32:35.082 --> 32:35.743
And Anne's.

32:36.905 --> 32:37.486
And Anne's.

32:38.767 --> 32:40.790
A couple of pages of Anne and a couple of Emily's.

32:40.810 --> 32:43.053
This is... I expected it to be larger than that.

32:43.473 --> 32:44.414
This is Clement Short.

32:44.475 --> 32:46.938
We're talking about maybe four inches by six inches here.

32:48.320 --> 32:55.589
This is... She says, my birthday... Well, I have a translation for her right there.

32:56.270 --> 33:02.678
And then she did a miniature... She did a drawing of herself and her dog, Keeper.

33:03.856 --> 33:04.317
Beautiful.

33:04.537 --> 33:07.843
And then, uh, that's Emily Bronte.

33:07.923 --> 33:10.948
And I just played one where I was going to play this keeper.

33:11.148 --> 33:16.056
And then Thursday, this is Anne Bronte, Thursday, July 31st, 1845.

33:16.176 --> 33:18.180
Yesterday was Emily's birthday.

33:19.342 --> 33:29.779
So this is, uh, now the Bronte Museum, I'm not sure that this Anne's diary pages have ever been published.

33:30.974 --> 33:31.695
I have here.

33:31.735 --> 33:39.245
They have a facsimile of the picture in Emily's room, probably.

33:39.586 --> 33:40.947
Now, what are your dog's names again?

33:40.967 --> 33:41.829
Annie.

33:42.289 --> 33:42.810
Annie.

33:42.830 --> 33:43.611
And Emily.

33:43.711 --> 33:44.092
Emily.

33:44.272 --> 33:45.854
I thought maybe Keeper, no.

33:45.874 --> 33:47.276
That would have been too.

33:47.757 --> 33:51.401
Oh, here's the production of your page.

33:51.421 --> 33:51.562
Mm-hmm.

33:53.925 --> 33:54.045
Yeah.

33:54.970 --> 33:55.791
And which book is this?

33:56.192 --> 33:59.115
This is the, uh, the broad page.

33:59.135 --> 34:01.659
The book is the Lives, Friendships, Correspondence.

34:01.679 --> 34:08.828
Yeah, this is, uh, who's... So you must get, you must get quite a few requests from scholars to come and do, and, and do you generally comply with their requests?

34:09.849 --> 34:10.971
Yes, I generally do.

34:11.651 --> 34:17.439
But this, this, uh, this is, uh, tells what you write.

34:17.459 --> 34:18.620
It's a showy, breezy, cool.

34:18.740 --> 34:20.142
I'm 27 years old today.

34:20.723 --> 34:23.847
This morning Ann and I opened up the paper we wrote four years ago.

34:24.299 --> 34:26.001
It's on my 23rd birthday.

34:26.681 --> 34:32.968
This paper we intended, if all be well, to open on my 30th, three years hence, and so forth and so forth.

34:32.988 --> 34:38.013
And she goes on to tell about her brother and the travels and other things.

34:38.533 --> 34:42.798
We're all in decent health, only that Papa hasn't been playing it in his eyes and so forth.

34:44.860 --> 34:48.023
By mistake, I find we've opened the paper on the 31st instead of the 30th.

34:48.043 --> 34:50.946
You see, I'm amazed that they allowed this to leave England.

34:51.186 --> 34:52.247
Well, they didn't know where it was.

34:52.598 --> 35:06.235
Well, really, because they have... Well, probably, as I said, when I saw the reproduction in Emily Bronte's bedroom at Howard, I knew where this was.

35:07.156 --> 35:09.519
And I didn't know if this was authentic.

35:10.260 --> 35:16.288
So I said to the lady in charge of the museum, do you have the original of that?

35:16.308 --> 35:17.830
And she said, no, we don't know where it is.

35:18.400 --> 35:20.262
And I said, uh-huh.

35:20.282 --> 35:23.946
I know where I am.

35:24.306 --> 35:27.210
So these are Charlotte Bronte letters.

35:28.391 --> 35:34.978
One of them is, in my opinion, one of the greatest letters she ever wrote, which is this one coming up.

35:36.299 --> 35:41.045
Unfortunately, this one, that is missing.

35:41.085 --> 35:44.188
And the reason it's missing is that someone cut her signature out of that.

35:44.810 --> 35:46.072
Probably her father.

35:46.132 --> 35:47.594
Probably her father who did that.

35:47.614 --> 35:49.137
Who sold her autograph.

35:49.377 --> 35:52.121
This is the letter where she refuses marriage.

35:52.161 --> 35:53.223
During his lifetime.

35:53.363 --> 36:02.657
She has proposed marriage and goes on to say that the reason she's going to turn down these things is that she is not the woman in place she is.

36:03.518 --> 36:04.419
That's wonderful.

36:05.121 --> 36:07.063
Mr. Henry Newsy.

36:08.726 --> 36:10.368
N-U-S-S-E-Y.

36:10.429 --> 36:11.891
The Reverend Henry Newsy.

36:11.971 --> 36:13.433
And he had proposed marriage to her.

36:17.868 --> 36:30.627
It goes on to say, you are aware that I have many reasons to feel grateful to your family, that I have peculiar reasons for affection towards one, at least, of your sisters, and also that I highly esteem yourself.

36:30.987 --> 36:37.236
Do not, therefore, accuse me of wrong motives when I say that my answer to your proposal must be a decided negative.

36:37.256 --> 36:38.478
Decided negative?

36:40.641 --> 36:41.402
Isn't that wonderful?

36:41.623 --> 36:43.485
Right, it's all.

36:43.505 --> 36:46.069
And then she goes on to say that she's not the...

36:46.724 --> 36:51.933
She's not the woman he thinks she is, and then she kind of tells what her own beliefs are.

36:52.815 --> 36:53.676
She says, farewell.

36:54.057 --> 36:57.823
I shall always be glad to hear from you as a friend.

36:57.843 --> 37:09.323
I think the bill about she would never, she wouldn't dishonor a fine man by accepting his proposal to avoid the stigma of being a spitz check.

37:09.539 --> 37:11.282
This is, by the way, page 172-73.

37:11.723 --> 37:17.954
I might just... I can check if you get this verbatim at Harvard.

37:17.974 --> 37:25.228
Yeah, this is the... And here's the editor.

37:26.270 --> 37:27.452
The Shakespeare Head Press.

37:30.297 --> 37:32.982
Contest, volume one.

37:35.408 --> 37:37.271
She says, as for me, you do not know me.

37:37.491 --> 37:40.556
I am not the serious, grave, cool-headed individual you suppose.

37:41.117 --> 37:42.940
You would think me romantic and eccentric.

37:43.460 --> 37:45.383
You would say I was satirical and severe.

37:46.665 --> 37:59.084
And then she goes on, however, I scorn deceit, and I will never, for the sake of obtaining the distinction of matrimony and escaping the stigma of an old maid, take a worthy man whom I am conscious, I cannot render half it.

37:59.104 --> 37:59.785
And so forth.

37:59.806 --> 38:01.067
It's a terrific letter.

38:01.088 --> 38:03.111
Isn't it?

38:03.131 --> 38:04.032
And we bought that.

38:05.395 --> 38:07.717
at a growlier sale, didn't we, or something, in New York?

38:08.578 --> 38:09.419
Yes, yes.

38:11.542 --> 38:12.062
Moving on.

38:13.263 --> 38:19.470
Just as a little curiosity, because we don't really talk about that much, these are some love letters that Dylan Thomas wrote.

38:19.650 --> 38:29.621
There are six love letters that Dylan Thomas wrote to a woman in all the biographies referred to her as Sarah, but was not her real name.

38:29.981 --> 38:32.344
Dylan, of course, addresses it to the real person.

38:32.424 --> 38:33.445
He wasn't trying to hide it.

38:33.762 --> 38:39.429
And these are letters, she was, her name was Pearl.

38:39.469 --> 38:41.592
And these letters were.

38:42.033 --> 38:43.455
That's why they call us Sarah.

38:43.715 --> 38:49.242
And we bought it from Hamill and Barclay.

38:49.282 --> 38:57.553
And they had had it, they had a way of keeping things down in the safe.

38:57.573 --> 38:59.395
And people didn't even know they had it.

38:59.415 --> 39:00.597
And they said this was

39:01.049 --> 39:04.414
It was the first time that they'd been offered for sale.

39:05.034 --> 39:10.382
But the woman had agreed to sell them and then sent the check back.

39:10.402 --> 39:11.203
I think she's still living.

39:11.223 --> 39:11.964
I think she has a family.

39:11.984 --> 39:15.809
And said she changed her mind and she really didn't want to sell the letters.

39:16.751 --> 39:19.534
All the correspondence is there.

39:19.554 --> 39:23.300
So they wrote back and convinced her that they should be made available.

39:23.320 --> 39:25.102
See, the copyright is not owned by the woman.

39:25.282 --> 39:26.063
Made available.

39:26.103 --> 39:28.407
The person who writes the letter owns it.

39:28.507 --> 39:30.630
She really couldn't stop publication of those.

39:30.650 --> 39:30.870
No.

39:31.171 --> 39:36.677
of those letters, but she could, you know, cause some more of them.

39:36.697 --> 39:38.759
Well, that's the stuff I brought in today.

39:38.839 --> 39:39.319
That's wonderful.

39:39.519 --> 39:42.823
These are all different things.

39:44.484 --> 39:47.407
Here's a presentation copy of David Copperfield, another one.

39:47.848 --> 39:57.938
This, I think, is from, the only interesting thing about this, other than its presentation, is it is from the Jerome Kern Library.

39:58.627 --> 40:00.451
who was a very prominent player.

40:00.471 --> 40:07.448
You see, lots of dust, but we don't worry about that because in general... I mean, nobody touches the books but Bill.

40:08.711 --> 40:12.440
And occasionally he does go through and dusts them when he handles them.

40:12.460 --> 40:14.745
But somebody, one of the...

40:16.227 --> 40:28.399
People, the authorities on books, said that dust is the best preserving... This volume I show... When you have people in the house, is it understood that nobody uses the books except Carol?

40:28.419 --> 40:29.360
Yeah.

40:29.781 --> 40:33.204
This is interesting, only because to show you what great bindings some of these things are.

40:33.224 --> 40:36.247
These are original drawings by Thalesville.

40:37.608 --> 40:41.953
This was Kenyon's, mine, and Carlisle.

40:41.973 --> 40:43.314
Just look at these.

40:43.374 --> 40:46.217
These are the plates and the original drawings for the plates.

40:46.653 --> 40:53.960
You see, they're often reversed, because the etcher worked backwards.

40:54.421 --> 40:59.306
So the figure is on the other side, you see, from the original drawing and then the image.

40:59.726 --> 41:00.567
Sometimes they're not.

41:00.647 --> 41:02.429
Sometimes they're not reversed.

41:02.449 --> 41:05.011
In fact, this is not reversed.

41:05.872 --> 41:08.895
But can you imagine the cost of putting this together?

41:08.915 --> 41:10.236
What's the color added?

41:10.296 --> 41:12.398
Well, they were hand-colored by Felton.

41:12.659 --> 41:16.002
But were they hand-colored the original?

41:16.454 --> 41:21.942
Or the, uh... Okay, pale-thrope... ...illustration.

41:22.463 --> 41:24.847
Is it the color on the original or on the illustration?

41:25.207 --> 41:26.189
On the original.

41:26.209 --> 41:27.591
On the original.

41:28.312 --> 41:32.178
The original drawings are something, I mean, there aren't any original Winslow Homer woodblocks.

41:32.459 --> 41:32.579
No.

41:32.699 --> 41:35.663
It's just, you know, if you have the Harpers, you have them, you know?

41:35.683 --> 41:38.608
The, uh, a couple of things you have, Dr. H.D.

41:39.449 --> 41:41.252
I think it's interesting.

41:41.272 --> 41:43.255
This is the least signed by Dickens for you.

41:43.606 --> 41:47.870
Showing me, uh, Uncle Bear Finn.

41:47.930 --> 41:49.952
Oh, yeah, it's over there.

41:49.972 --> 41:55.977
Uh, this is interesting because it's, uh, it's an autograph letter, uh, from George Crookshank to Dickens.

41:56.938 --> 41:59.160
Crookshank, of course, is a great illustrator.

41:59.660 --> 42:03.084
And the interesting thing is, is he both signed it.

42:03.744 --> 42:03.804
Oh.

42:04.465 --> 42:09.009
So, dude, Dickens, you might, well, you know, I think I have a picture.

42:09.029 --> 42:10.350
Might I have a picture, by the way?

42:11.211 --> 42:12.432
Is that all right?

42:12.800 --> 42:13.601
No, by all means.

42:14.182 --> 42:20.651
He says, I know you will oblige me with your autograph for a young lady, yours truly, George Crookshank.

42:20.671 --> 42:35.171
And then he says, my dear George, with great pleasure, partly for your sake and partly for the sake of a young lady, unknown, faithfully yours, Dickens.

42:35.191 --> 42:36.933
We won't take out too much more of you, sir.

42:36.953 --> 42:39.617
All right, well, we'll, no, we'll not go.

42:39.637 --> 42:39.837
Obviously.

42:40.070 --> 42:45.776
Would you guys like a piece of cake and a cup of coffee or something like that?

42:45.816 --> 42:51.862
This is just the... Lou Feldman, by the way, is a character for me.

42:51.882 --> 42:53.063
He's kind of a false stat.

42:54.705 --> 43:09.840
I'm going to take it out of the glaze thing so it might reproduce that.

43:10.192 --> 43:31.931
She's usually off, you know, and she never bothers any.

43:32.011 --> 43:39.557
Okay.

43:40.887 --> 43:44.312
Want a shot of Tamalei?

43:44.332 --> 43:47.857
You don't mind.

43:47.877 --> 43:48.678
No?

43:53.325 --> 43:59.174
I didn't even ask you anything about your special life of birth here.

43:59.354 --> 44:05.443
Well, I'm not sure I can do that.

44:05.761 --> 44:07.803
I can send you an official bio.

44:07.823 --> 44:08.344
You want one?

44:08.424 --> 44:09.905
Yeah, that would be super.

44:09.925 --> 44:11.186
I don't want to take up this as bad.

44:11.206 --> 44:12.768
Well, that would be easier.

44:12.808 --> 44:17.633
This is a relatable time here.

44:17.673 --> 44:19.975
You're a young fellow from Dayton, Ohio.

44:20.055 --> 44:21.116
Yes.

44:21.717 --> 44:27.222
Did you ever... I mean, this is quite a collection, which one can hear about a major... No, that's true.

44:27.243 --> 44:29.325
It is a major collection.

44:29.345 --> 44:31.527
What happens to this collection, by the way?

44:31.547 --> 44:35.751
Well, some of it will go to our children.

44:36.828 --> 45:05.350
uh some of it we will probably have to option because the estate uh taxes on some of it would be so great that the kids won't be able to oh yeah

45:07.135 --> 45:11.121
Boy, they've taken all the guesswork out of photography.

45:11.601 --> 45:16.749
I bought my first couple of night plots and I was under service 20 years ago overseas.

45:17.009 --> 45:19.112
I never thought I'd have to, but boy, they make it.

45:19.933 --> 45:21.495
Yeah, what kind is that?

45:22.116 --> 45:29.747
Yeah, I've got, you know, I have a couple of Lycats and I don't use them.

45:31.109 --> 45:33.092
There's just so much trouble compared to

45:33.359 --> 45:34.481
The modern, you know.

45:34.761 --> 45:40.250
Oh, you want me out on here?

45:40.410 --> 45:42.974
Well, she may pose that on you.

45:43.014 --> 45:52.088
She doesn't like to do that.

45:57.096 --> 45:58.438
All right.

46:00.005 --> 46:02.749
You know, there's a play on Broadway called I Hate Hamlet.

46:02.829 --> 46:04.631
I wanted to see it as a matter of fact.

46:05.212 --> 46:05.853
Have you seen it?

46:06.293 --> 46:08.716
No, but it's my life story.

46:09.297 --> 46:11.560
Come on.

46:12.281 --> 46:18.769
Oops, that misfire, that misfire.

46:18.789 --> 46:23.495
I'm trying to get that.

46:23.555 --> 46:24.516
Well, I'm kidding about that.

46:24.597 --> 46:29.623
When I lived in Hepburn's house, as I told you...

46:29.857 --> 46:33.682
I would go into this, and I was a bit actor in town, trying to get a job as an actor.

46:34.003 --> 46:37.327
I used to go into the library and I'd say, John, help me, help me.

46:37.688 --> 46:40.452
So now I've finally written a play about the same situation.

46:41.333 --> 46:42.274
All right, coming over here.

46:44.898 --> 46:59.678
These are, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops

46:59.827 --> 47:07.017
that's inscribed to Edith Berkley and Lewis Carroll.

47:07.037 --> 47:12.245
This is Mark Twain.

47:13.727 --> 47:16.751
This is Barbara's collection.

47:16.871 --> 47:23.461
And as you can see, it has Jumping Frog and all the buildings.

47:23.601 --> 47:29.209
Let's see if I can find which house is all there.

47:29.729 --> 47:36.701
I'll tell you the picture I want to get it open too.

47:37.102 --> 47:40.027
Oh, okay.

47:40.147 --> 47:49.042
It wouldn't be in here, but here's Kenyon's... I have a Huckleberry thing, but not quite like that.

47:49.282 --> 47:52.047
That's pretty wonderful.

47:52.067 --> 47:55.433
How about a child's sayer in the blue material clock?

48:04.390 --> 48:11.561
Well, I know the, I know the, um, the jumping frogs.

48:11.721 --> 48:12.182
Yeah.

48:13.344 --> 48:18.031
Oh, here's the, here's the bright color.

48:18.051 --> 48:18.913
Oh, I'm sorry.

48:18.933 --> 48:20.115
Yeah, I got to take a picture of that.

48:20.756 --> 48:22.498
That's really the high spot that I want.

48:23.039 --> 48:23.500
I don't know.

48:23.580 --> 48:24.982
That's a little bit.

48:25.263 --> 48:26.004
Yeah, maybe.

48:26.024 --> 48:27.166
It's going to bounce.

48:27.546 --> 48:31.933
Yeah, that's great.

48:32.875 --> 48:34.997
Oh, that's terrific.

48:35.017 --> 48:41.765
Oh yeah, great.

48:42.045 --> 48:44.588
You know Sandy Berger up in Carmel?

48:44.608 --> 48:47.951
Salford Berger, he has this great William Morris collection.

48:47.971 --> 48:52.937
You know Mason?

48:54.599 --> 48:58.663
Oh yeah, the doctor, yeah.

49:00.010 --> 49:07.823
I'm not trying to do all the collectives.

49:08.103 --> 49:11.388
I'm really interested.

49:12.150 --> 49:17.799
I think the book's going to be good because I'm not trying to make it... Come over here.

49:17.939 --> 49:21.765
I have some interesting things over here.

49:25.863 --> 49:29.387
This was Poe's mother's copy.

49:29.407 --> 49:31.028
Poe's mother was an actress, as you may know.

49:31.549 --> 49:40.859
And somewhere, line in line, when I was buying Poe, I was discovered these are all plays that Poe's mother was in.

49:41.459 --> 49:41.960
Really?

49:41.980 --> 49:50.168
And this... Let's see where this is on.

49:50.909 --> 49:54.773
And they had pictures of Ed and Bill

49:55.512 --> 49:58.235
Part of Phoebe was taken by Pauline Miller.

49:59.096 --> 50:01.098
Oh, here it is.

50:01.859 --> 50:02.620
Where's Phoebe?

50:04.402 --> 50:06.404
This must be a very scarce item.

50:06.424 --> 50:06.565
Phoebe.

50:06.785 --> 50:09.768
This was Mrs. Poe.

50:14.534 --> 50:15.154
Poe's mother.

50:15.455 --> 50:16.556
Miss Arnold.

50:16.856 --> 50:18.458
That would be Phoebe.

50:18.478 --> 50:24.345
Then these other plays also have them.

50:24.365 --> 50:24.625
I don't know.

50:24.976 --> 50:25.818
I don't know which they are.

50:26.198 --> 50:29.725
But generally speaking, they list which part Mrs. Poe was playing.

50:32.410 --> 50:34.655
You mentioned that you were a magic collector?

50:35.516 --> 50:35.596
Yes.

50:35.616 --> 50:37.600
Oh, here's Poe's.

50:37.620 --> 50:38.302
Oh, it's his poem.

50:38.562 --> 50:39.103
Yeah.

50:39.775 --> 50:41.197
So they all saved public.

50:41.217 --> 50:44.041
You must have had some interest in that Mulholland collection.

50:44.061 --> 50:45.783
I know a lot about the Mulholland collection.

50:45.803 --> 50:46.704
I've seen the collection.

50:47.946 --> 50:49.608
I know what's happening to it.

50:49.628 --> 50:50.790
I know what's not happening to it.

50:50.810 --> 50:51.451
What's happening?

50:51.891 --> 50:58.039
Well, the government— I know the RTC has it, and they've put a 1.2 million number on it, I guess.

50:58.100 --> 51:02.205
Well, I know a guy that did more than that, and they haven't sold it to him, because once they got that bid,

51:02.742 --> 51:31.483
uh they decided maybe they had underpriced it now they're waiting to see what else happened i can tell you i'm not supposed to tell you this book is how i met john fleming first time i saw this is a picture of dorian gray and it's inscribed by oscar wilde um and it's uh there's oscar wilde when i looked at it in john's shelf it had a price in it very i thought

51:31.919 --> 51:33.201
fair and modest price.

51:33.761 --> 51:34.723
So I said, I'll buy it.

51:34.763 --> 51:38.628
And John laughed and said, that's not today's price bill.

51:38.668 --> 51:42.413
That happened to be left in when that book sold many years ago.

51:42.493 --> 51:43.915
I said, oh, I'm disappointed about that.

51:44.315 --> 51:46.118
He said, look, take it for that price.

51:46.538 --> 51:47.800
He said, you know, you're a new customer.

51:47.820 --> 51:49.302
That's a class guy, isn't it?

51:49.322 --> 51:50.443
He said, you're a new customer.

51:51.505 --> 51:52.246
You picked out a book.

51:52.266 --> 51:52.987
You'd like to have it.

51:53.768 --> 51:54.348
We made a deal.

51:54.729 --> 51:56.391
So I didn't pay very much.

51:56.540 --> 51:59.064
Did you ever deal with Margie Cohn or Chris?

51:59.084 --> 51:59.745
She's more modern.

51:59.765 --> 52:00.487
No, she was more modern.

52:00.507 --> 52:00.947
More modern.

52:00.967 --> 52:01.949
I knew her.

52:02.610 --> 52:07.598
This is, I think, a terrific copy of The Origin of the Species.

52:07.939 --> 52:10.804
Beautiful copy, as you can see.

52:14.249 --> 52:14.991
Very good condition.

52:15.191 --> 52:16.473
Little Falcon, look at that.

52:16.733 --> 52:17.895
But still, bright.

52:18.096 --> 52:18.536
Very bright.

52:21.081 --> 52:23.104
You said that...
