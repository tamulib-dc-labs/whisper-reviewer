00:02.495 --> 00:04.900
We're talking about the free librarians there.

00:05.321 --> 00:08.668
Well, I think so.

00:08.688 --> 00:18.510
Well, I mean, in a sense, the library was a fait accompli and nobody quite knew what the disaster was going to be.

00:18.530 --> 00:20.875
But I think it's partly the union people

00:20.855 --> 00:37.660
I mean, they're the people in a way who I think got Nicholson Baker interested, you know, kept him interested, you know, brought together this group of this famed Edith Cedar group who have held the feet of the city to the fire in an extraordinary way.

00:37.680 --> 00:39.422
I mean, they made people jump.

00:40.364 --> 00:43.909
You know, once his name was locked out and lost his job and...

00:43.889 --> 00:44.493
Really?

00:44.955 --> 00:51.132
Because the first appeal was simply on the grounds of what libraries should be.

00:51.652 --> 00:55.979
But then they started, you know, making the city understand how the money had been spent.

00:55.999 --> 01:01.627
And I think that that's sort of, you know, it's one of those things you couldn't do in advance.

01:01.687 --> 01:03.270
You couldn't have prevented this happening.

01:03.290 --> 01:07.115
A library that holds fewer books in the old library.

01:07.135 --> 01:08.257
It's an amazing business.

01:08.317 --> 01:15.208
But they could have gone away with it, I think, without these people creating a sort of public outrage about it.

01:15.228 --> 01:16.610
How do you think it could have gone away with it?

01:16.630 --> 01:18.132
It could have just been gone, and that would have been eliminated.

01:19.006 --> 01:24.717
Well, and I think so many people, I mean, it's the same with the British Library.

01:24.858 --> 01:30.589
You know, you go to the new library and you find that half the books are still in storage, and everybody shrugs and says, okay.

01:31.170 --> 01:34.517
And people wouldn't have made the discards, but no one would have noticed.

01:34.497 --> 01:40.706
And the fact that, you know, the promise was that all the books would be available immediately disappeared.

01:40.766 --> 01:42.509
I mean, it's the great thing about futurology.

01:42.569 --> 01:45.193
You make these great long-term predictions.

01:45.213 --> 01:50.480
You know, what I was saying last night, it's long-term prophecy and short-term profit.

01:50.861 --> 01:57.811
You know, you grab the bag and get out before anyone notices that all the wonderful things you predicted didn't come to pass.

01:57.831 --> 02:01.737
Do you think this was just terrible planning and you think there was an agenda for me?

02:01.717 --> 02:11.426
Well, I'm sort of, you know, I don't know, I'm not close enough to the city politics and the planning really to know.

02:11.446 --> 02:28.382
I think it's this terrible mixture of, you know, on the one hand incompetence, but also it's so easy to get people to believe, you know, that the future is automatically going to repair all the ills of the past.

02:28.362 --> 02:31.047
You know, you do it with technology, you do it with buildings.

02:31.067 --> 02:35.456
The new building is going to have none of the problems the old building did.

02:35.476 --> 02:43.772
And half the problems are the parts of technological problems, and when the wheel turns, they'll all be solved.

02:44.765 --> 02:51.319
is the notion of supersession.

02:51.500 --> 02:54.867
The future will just write off the past and its problems.

02:54.887 --> 02:56.511
And people believe it.

02:56.531 --> 03:01.963
I suspect that Cathy Simon, who is the architect who works basically on the interiors,

03:02.197 --> 03:03.119
you know, believed in.

03:04.781 --> 03:08.367
Did she ever work in a library before?

03:08.387 --> 03:20.307
Yes, she did the library at Davis, UC Davis, which is a much smaller library and much lower users have it.

03:20.287 --> 03:21.428
It's a nice line.

03:21.448 --> 03:25.433
I mean, you see a lot of the things passed over from one to the other.

03:25.453 --> 03:32.842
But yeah, she's done a lot of public buildings.

03:33.964 --> 03:41.793
I think she did a big thing at... Yeah, so she's not inexperienced in that way.

03:42.454 --> 03:49.062
But I suspect that the measurement of the shelves and things was just constantly fudged.

03:49.548 --> 03:54.537
until in the end they suddenly said, should you really mean we need that number of cells?

03:54.557 --> 03:55.579
We don't have room.

03:55.599 --> 04:01.971
Do you think that books were a secondary consideration to an incidental?

04:01.991 --> 04:05.919
I suspect, I mean incidental is perhaps unfair, but secondary I would think so.

04:05.939 --> 04:09.345
I mean I think in a way the notion of public space

04:09.865 --> 04:16.131
and all those fairly laudable aims came first.

04:16.231 --> 04:20.936
Have you been to the new parts of the library here yet?

04:20.956 --> 04:25.340
Have you been to the new parts of the library, the Berkeley library?

04:25.481 --> 04:27.483
I mean, it's the same thing.

04:27.823 --> 04:30.005
They're now all on these rolling sets.

04:30.486 --> 04:38.033
Books don't need room, and the more we can minimize the space for books and maximize the space for workstations,

04:39.194 --> 04:50.153
Well, yeah, they didn't take books out of storage when they changed the library here.

04:50.173 --> 05:01.692
They've added some space, but any idea that we're going to have the whole collection in one place...

05:02.718 --> 05:07.448
Well, except that the promise of the city library was that there was a word.

05:07.468 --> 05:08.551
I saw a tape.

05:09.292 --> 05:16.849
Rowan showed me a tape in the future library.

05:16.869 --> 05:18.352
Do you see that tape?

05:18.372 --> 05:18.873
It's lightning.

05:18.893 --> 05:23.022
I mean, it's, uh, Rowan says right there, 2.5 million books.

05:23.002 --> 05:40.685
We're going to have 2.5 million books in this same time.

05:40.705 --> 05:41.526
It's great that it's rare, but it's good.

05:41.546 --> 05:43.329
And the collections are going to be here, and you can't even fit a million books in them.

05:43.349 --> 05:45.111
So tell me a little bit about yourself, biographically, and how it is that we, you know,

05:45.867 --> 05:51.138
Well, I guess we're talking civic assistant libraries and future libraries.

05:51.499 --> 05:52.682
That brings you to Berkeley.

05:52.702 --> 05:57.592
We've got 10 or 15 minutes just to go on your background.

05:57.672 --> 05:59.777
Okay, let me see what I can do.

05:59.897 --> 06:04.467
I came to the state straight out of school.

06:04.784 --> 06:08.330
school, a university in England.

06:08.350 --> 06:10.975
It was Bristol University.

06:11.636 --> 06:13.038
Study English and Philosophy.

06:13.299 --> 06:29.627
And it was a great place because it managed, it began part of my concerns because in my final year it closed down the library in order to move to a new library just because I was trying to work for my final year.

06:29.894 --> 06:50.873
that i um so i came to the states to teach young result job in a high school i stayed on and did a graduate degree in english in st louis or washington university and then i went to new york and worked in publishing for about four years primarily with dover i was a production editor i wasn't a i did

06:50.853 --> 06:57.676
Copy editing freelance, but my real work was actually making physical books appear.

06:58.398 --> 07:04.137
And then, more or less, I met my wife who lives in California, so I moved to California.

07:04.589 --> 07:12.563
or without a job in 1987, 10 years ago.

07:12.583 --> 07:23.622
And I went and through my wife I met Geoff Nunberg and was introduced to Xerox and Xerox cars.

07:23.762 --> 07:26.968
I went down there and got a foot of jobs.

07:27.353 --> 07:33.625
you know, writing this American thinking, you know, ponderous and brown thoughts.

07:33.685 --> 07:40.297
There's a world of sort of technicians that has this slight awe of people who think about things in other ways.

07:40.317 --> 07:44.705
They don't necessarily pay attention to them, but they have a certain irreverence.

07:44.725 --> 07:45.767
And so I became one of those people.

07:46.253 --> 08:05.713
then began to work with the guy who's the head of the research center john brown and he and i have written papers over 10 years together and um and i worked with jeff as well and that way i came to deal with the

08:06.537 --> 08:09.680
the materiality of objects, in a sense.

08:09.761 --> 08:20.713
While everyone was saying, we can digitize this, we can digitize that, you know, we'll put it on this, I kept saying, well, no, there's actually something important about the material nature of objects.

08:20.733 --> 08:33.607
And even actually when you have, you know, words on the screen, the screen and the interface all play a role in how you understand it, it isn't just the ASCII text dribbling across.

08:33.627 --> 08:36.510
No, there are claims by people like me.

08:36.946 --> 09:06.885
i guess i mean yeah there are now more and more people who are studying the notion of genre in relation to technological forms and my claim was to say it's not only a question of genre but genre particularly with the forms that we know is not just you know the the um what can you say the formulaic nature of a text but actually it's material you understand a particular book

09:07.355 --> 09:17.731
because it's, you know, in hard covers, and it's got Oxford University Press on the imprint, and it weighs a certain amount, and the paper has a certain layout, and all those things are part of genre.

09:17.751 --> 09:19.874
Are you familiar with a book called Powering Texts?

09:20.114 --> 09:21.136
Yeah, yeah.

09:21.156 --> 09:22.297
I'm reading it on the way up.

09:22.618 --> 09:24.621
Which is interesting, yeah.

09:24.641 --> 09:27.405
Ken Carpenter, this one is Ken Carpenter, who's a character who basically...

09:27.385 --> 09:48.913
He supervises the selection books to go out to the Harvard Plus for it.

09:48.933 --> 09:50.656
And I said, well, one of the criteria, he's telling me the criteria, various criteria.

09:50.676 --> 09:50.996
They're serious.

09:51.016 --> 09:51.657
I don't think it's very serious.

09:51.677 --> 09:52.718
These aren't even books that they're getting rid of.

09:52.738 --> 09:54.761
They're just books that are going to be taken out of Cambridge and put in at a 34 miles to Southland.

09:54.781 --> 09:55.502
And he's describing all the factors.

09:55.482 --> 10:16.666
But he said, read a book called Paratext.

10:16.686 --> 10:17.187
Of course, it's sold off.

10:17.207 --> 10:18.148
I mean, only in Harvard Square, maybe Berkeley.

10:18.168 --> 10:19.109
I had an order and finally bought it on Reddit.

10:19.129 --> 10:19.770
I've been reading it on the web.

10:19.790 --> 10:21.191
But he takes the physicality of the paratextual elements into account.

10:21.211 --> 10:21.772
It is, it's very much, yeah.

10:21.792 --> 10:22.513
He takes these factors into account.

10:22.533 --> 10:23.054
He's deciding what a book.

10:23.074 --> 10:23.774
I mean, it's not just a part of it.

10:23.794 --> 10:23.914
Right.

10:23.935 --> 10:24.215
And we all do.

10:24.235 --> 10:24.375
I mean,

10:24.355 --> 10:26.498
We all know how to scan bookshelves.

10:26.838 --> 10:34.228
You know, any sophisticated or moderately sophisticated reader doesn't stand in a bookstore and read every title as they go along.

10:34.728 --> 10:38.473
You do this quick scanning of what it looks like, how it's presented, and what.

10:39.374 --> 10:40.376
And, uh, scans.

10:41.297 --> 10:45.402
So one of the things I tried to say, zero, is to do endless, um,

10:45.382 --> 10:52.577
have endless high-speed printers with internal binding, and they always ignore the spine.

10:52.597 --> 10:55.162
The spine is what most of us spend our lives looking at.

10:55.523 --> 10:56.505
Zero.

10:57.046 --> 11:05.263
Who have this huge business invested in high-speed, low-run printing and binding.

11:05.935 --> 11:25.480
and they always think well we can spiral bind it at the end or we can stick a bit of black tape on the end and you say but people spend their lives looking at the sound the cover is irrelevant yeah absolutely i mean i worked in i was in london i worked for four years running a bookshop and you realize that nearly every book is designed

11:25.932 --> 11:29.479
to go, as they say in the trade, face forward.

11:29.579 --> 11:32.444
But in fact, they spend all their lives fine hours.

11:33.025 --> 11:42.523
And so I began a small publishing company, and we sort of focused on how to make this fine stand out, because you realize, particularly for a small publishing company,

11:42.503 --> 11:46.512
You never get the luxury of being in a dump bin with the face of the book show.

11:46.532 --> 11:48.776
Look at the spine of my book.

11:48.796 --> 11:49.919
It is so striking.

11:50.139 --> 11:53.927
We actually were going to make the book work just out of the spine.

11:53.947 --> 11:55.571
How do we need?

11:55.751 --> 11:57.335
I haven't.

11:57.415 --> 11:59.579
Have you seen my book?

12:00.201 --> 12:00.401
I haven't.

12:00.421 --> 12:00.782
It's an exquisite.

12:01.522 --> 12:16.463
Who did the design?

12:16.483 --> 12:16.864
I chose the artist.

12:16.844 --> 12:40.048
Yeah, so they put some money in there.

12:40.068 --> 12:40.648
They put some money in there.

12:40.668 --> 12:41.249
They put some money in there.

12:41.269 --> 12:41.850
They put some money in there.

12:41.870 --> 12:42.450
They put some money in there.

12:42.470 --> 12:43.051
They put some money in there.

12:43.071 --> 12:43.651
They put some money in there.

12:43.671 --> 12:44.252
They put some money in there.

12:44.553 --> 13:03.519
It sounds like they're getting their money back, too.

13:03.539 --> 13:03.639
Yeah.

13:03.659 --> 13:07.143
And when the advances don't have them, you know, on their own record, they only had a $15,000 advance fund.

13:07.163 --> 13:09.186
And, of course, putting the $6,300 copies, you know, up to $16,000 copies in credit.

13:09.206 --> 13:09.907
That's the whole thing.

13:09.927 --> 13:10.568
So the publisher has a $35 book.

13:10.588 --> 13:11.549
Yeah, well, that's amazing.

13:11.569 --> 13:12.771
So the publisher, like, $1.6 million or something like that.

13:12.751 --> 13:18.819
But it sounds like they just sort of put themselves behind it a bit, which is great.

13:18.959 --> 13:26.108
I mean, because, you know, so often now... I mean, I was in the contract.

13:26.349 --> 13:35.080
It makes a huge difference, you know, and that's the way publicists make or break things.

13:35.460 --> 13:39.906
And even in the design, I mean, you know, those who just stick another...

13:40.966 --> 14:10.973
Well that to me is a real testament because

14:11.240 --> 14:20.760
You know, it's easy to reprint a book and say we're keeping you in the market, but actually to do that before the book is out there, and in a sense say we're committing ourselves to this,

14:21.584 --> 14:27.271
just as you have done as the author, you know, not knowing what might happen, is a big difference.

14:27.431 --> 14:27.972
This is wonderful.

14:27.992 --> 14:30.535
Very good, yeah, good time again.

14:30.555 --> 14:31.596
So let's go back.

14:31.616 --> 14:37.643
So anyway, so that's just the sort of line that I was peddling down there, you know, ten years ago.

14:37.744 --> 14:39.225
You're a consultant.

14:39.566 --> 14:41.969
I'm a consultant, so I'm entirely freelance.

14:41.989 --> 14:43.030
You may understand.

14:43.050 --> 14:43.971
Right, right.

14:44.051 --> 14:46.654
So what is your answer?

14:47.616 --> 14:48.857
Well...

14:48.837 --> 15:06.458
i mean i think what i was trying to say in a sense is that this this notion of the you know the material properties affecting your understanding of uh what would be regarded as the standard content

15:06.438 --> 15:13.627
It's something that I've learned from books and that can be transposed across to the design of machines and technologies in general.

15:13.647 --> 15:20.756
But all forms of communicative artefact are not irrelevant of material design.

15:20.936 --> 15:32.071
So it was a series of questions and essays about design which in some ways interested them because for them design is a huge question.

15:32.091 --> 15:33.272
How do you design?

15:33.792 --> 15:38.518
a print or a photocopier, you know, how do you deal with these things that are dealing with text?

15:39.359 --> 15:44.246
And now you're going to have these future photocopiers that are going to be rearranging text as you photocopy them.

15:44.266 --> 15:46.629
The digital photocopier will no longer make a true copy.

15:46.649 --> 15:55.581
You can alter it, you know, if you have a five-page book and you want it to copy down to a single, say, eight and a half hour eleven, it'll do it for you.

15:55.601 --> 16:02.230
So there are lots of questions about design and what effect that will have and if that will be useful or entirely confusing.

16:02.868 --> 16:09.258
So I think that they like to lend an ear to what's going on in that direction, even if they don't necessarily pay direct attention to it.

16:09.518 --> 16:19.073
Yeah, I don't know, I think it's... I mean, you know, Zerg's project has placed a board in anthropologists, you know, 15 years ago to understand how people use objects.

16:19.093 --> 16:26.344
They've always had this slightly wacky, you know, and they've had these artists in residence programs down there, so...

16:26.324 --> 16:30.955
It's one of the sort of founding institutions of Silicon Valley.

16:31.276 --> 16:33.521
I mean, Hewlett Packard is the real granddaddy.

16:34.884 --> 16:37.530
Xerox Park is the place where they designed the Macintosh.

16:38.833 --> 16:44.687
All the features that came out into Macintosh and Windows were first designed at Xerox.

16:44.667 --> 16:55.732
and Xerox never knew how to bring them to market and so Steve Jobs, you probably know the story, he went there one day and looked around and he saw this stuff and said, Christ, we can make millions with this and created the Macintosh.

16:56.574 --> 16:57.677
But it was all Xerox stuff.

16:58.118 --> 17:03.891
I mean, our Windows is going to further knock off and if you look at the Microsoft stuff,

17:03.871 --> 17:12.059
You know, Word, Excel, the drawing programs, they're all basically zero-op programs rewritten.

17:12.079 --> 17:16.224
They just didn't know how to do it commercially.

17:16.244 --> 17:19.967
So there's a book even somewhere called something like How Zero-op's Fumbled the Future.

17:19.987 --> 17:25.993
Which is sort of saying, look, these guys had everything that they've never made any money from.

17:26.013 --> 17:28.596
Fumbled, I think.

17:31.833 --> 17:35.699
That may be the subtitle, in case I can't remember the title.

17:36.139 --> 17:38.903
So how would you describe yourself in Berkeley?

17:38.923 --> 17:39.665
I never know.

17:39.685 --> 17:48.478
The great thing about coming to California is I discovered this term consultant, which sort of means never having to say you're unemployed.

17:48.498 --> 17:55.688
So I have a half-time research position at Berkeley, nothing to do with this, in another world entirely.

17:55.909 --> 18:00.996
And then I spent half my life also down in Zurich.

18:01.499 --> 18:20.529
writing about, you know, the future of the book or the future of the university or the future of the incorporation, all sort of related questions about, you know, how people tend to think that in the digital world, you know, material objects and also institutions will sort of disappear.

18:21.210 --> 18:26.038
And I guess that, finally, to get there is so hard if I'm interested in the language.

18:26.018 --> 18:34.253
Because people tend to sort of believe, you know, there's me and there's information and I don't need anybody else in between.

18:34.433 --> 18:35.976
So I don't need libraries anymore.

18:35.996 --> 18:37.739
It's all going to be online.

18:37.759 --> 18:39.362
The library doesn't play any role.

18:39.382 --> 18:41.125
The library is simply there to hand out.

18:41.105 --> 18:44.269
you know, these silly material objects that we don't need anymore.

18:44.289 --> 18:49.456
That you're one of these people who wants to believe that a library is a place for the soul.

18:49.597 --> 18:52.981
I mean, it's like... Yeah, yeah.

18:53.001 --> 18:57.688
And that it plays an enormous role in constructing, you know, what you understand and get.

18:57.748 --> 19:10.285
I mean, if you sit on the net trying to interpret the shit that comes over your email now, you know, or, you know, as you sit out, go out on the web, or even in the old days, what you drew over an FTP,

19:10.265 --> 19:14.831
It's impossible.

19:14.851 --> 19:32.636
And so what you tend to need, you know, are institutions that actually, you know, stabilize and interrelate all this junk in libraries that, you know, always prove really good at doing that.

19:32.656 --> 19:36.441
Now, this paper that you said to me that I was finally able to do that, you know, something a little bit about the genesis of that.

19:37.687 --> 19:41.392
Well, I'm actually trying to remember what the Genesis was.

19:43.335 --> 19:57.396
I guess it's working towards an overall book which is going to talk about the continuing importance of institutions in different facets of life.

19:57.416 --> 20:03.745
And so the first paper, which will probably go towards the book, was one called The Social Life of the Document.

20:04.467 --> 20:13.865
which in a sense was saying that documents aren't simply delivery systems, they're part of a social organization of society.

20:13.885 --> 20:21.801
So that in a way was saying that both documents and in a way also publishers as institutions will have a continued existence.

20:21.781 --> 20:27.673
however digital we go, they won't disappear as the sort of wild folks like to predict.

20:28.455 --> 20:39.638
So then the second one was to look at universities and say, again, everybody who wants to talk about, you know, distance learning.

20:39.618 --> 20:50.131
I'm just going to say that the university is going to disappear, we're all going to log on to the internet and they'll get our courses shipped to us online and there'll be no more universities.

20:50.151 --> 20:56.899
So the next paper is to say, in a similar vein, these institutions play a role, a social role, beyond the delivery of information.

20:56.919 --> 21:05.490
And the moment I'm working on is a parallel piece on the corporation and saying that organisations, non-profits and corporates,

21:05.791 --> 21:20.863
are more, again, than just an aggregate of people drawn together, that they too are institutions that have a particular role in society, and digitizing information ain't gonna make them, you know, ain't gonna obliterate them.

21:20.843 --> 21:42.972
You mentioned that in London you had a bookstore, is that right?

21:42.992 --> 21:43.132
Mm-hmm.

21:43.152 --> 21:44.694
And then you worked with a couple of them.

21:44.714 --> 21:44.854
Mm-hmm.

21:44.874 --> 21:46.116
And you were a literature scholar, I think, in the university.

21:46.136 --> 21:46.236
Yeah.

21:46.256 --> 21:47.298
So you must have pretty strong feelings about books.

21:47.318 --> 21:47.638
Books and texts.

21:47.658 --> 21:48.339
Yeah, yeah, and objects.

21:48.359 --> 21:48.459
Yeah.

21:48.479 --> 21:50.682
And do you despair about... Do you despair a lot about wearing books and all the books and...

21:50.662 --> 21:51.391
Well,

21:52.383 --> 22:12.350
Sometimes I do, but I guess I tend to do a little poem, which I've got at Tony's level, that's resisting the virtue of your life.

22:12.370 --> 22:14.273
I guess I don't despair as much as Ian.

22:14.373 --> 22:17.598
I didn't have a lot of time for that book.

22:17.618 --> 22:22.204
There's a wonderful article in there by a woman such a writer.

22:22.859 --> 22:33.214
I can't remember anything about it, but talking about sort of being a woman among the job culture of Silicon Valley.

22:34.596 --> 22:44.209
But I mean sometimes, you know, sometimes I despair and you know occasionally the sort of sadness of

22:44.594 --> 22:47.784
you know, bookstores going out of business and things.

22:48.004 --> 22:55.347
But I think I'm sanguine because I actually think the social forces that hold these things together

22:55.782 --> 23:20.845
are remarkably strong and when technology tries to you know when technologists try to remove these things and wash them away the social reaction response is often much stronger than the technology and so i actually believe books were held together for a long time here and that a lot of people will you know do some fairly ludicrous things to try to destroy them

23:21.095 --> 23:39.172
but that in fact, I'm rather sanguine that what tends to have the technologists is they say, you know, we'll make X and Y will happen and Y doesn't happen because, you know, social forces A, B, C, and D just don't disappear and rush away.

23:43.416 --> 23:50.663
The examples I tend to give when asked about this are sort of trivial, but I think probably, you know, in the 1930s, the New York Times

23:50.913 --> 23:56.228
looked at the typewriter and said, you know, this is the death of the pencil.

23:56.610 --> 23:57.673
Screw the New York Times.

23:57.693 --> 24:04.011
My own example is if you look at any movie about the future,

24:05.965 --> 24:10.472
You know, one of the things that runs from the 1920s onwards is the hinge disappears.

24:10.672 --> 24:12.735
It's a world of sliding doors.

24:12.835 --> 24:15.079
It's how we know we've got into the future.

24:15.099 --> 24:17.202
You don't need those things anymore.

24:17.543 --> 24:25.034
Well, you know, there's sort of comfort in the fact that your portable phone and your laptop computer, let alone your book, still survive on the hinge line.

24:25.615 --> 24:31.063
And for me, you know, the hinge door is this great sort of semiotic invention.

24:31.203 --> 24:33.247
You know, you can slam it.

24:33.647 --> 24:34.909
Oh, I haven't heard that.

24:34.889 --> 24:48.069
Well, in fact, I talk a little bit about the hymns in the essay that I have in the future of the book, the book The Echo and Nunberg and... You have an essay in the future of the book?

24:48.089 --> 24:50.012
Yeah, called Material Matters.

24:50.112 --> 24:53.096
I read it last November.

24:53.116 --> 24:54.619
I think it's expensive loads on it.

24:54.639 --> 24:55.460
I didn't realize it.

24:55.480 --> 24:56.121
I didn't connect the two.

24:56.141 --> 24:58.264
Mine's called Material Matters.

24:58.244 --> 25:03.873
That's quite a book.

25:03.993 --> 25:07.218
I consider that a seminal book.

25:07.238 --> 25:09.361
Yeah, I think it is good.

25:10.322 --> 25:11.023
I like it.

25:11.043 --> 25:12.285
It's very interesting.

25:13.307 --> 25:15.190
Jeff just sent me another review today.

25:15.250 --> 25:21.940
It's got a wonderful range of reviews, which in some sense, I think, reflect the range of...

25:22.358 --> 25:24.041
people inside it.

25:24.061 --> 25:31.595
Elizabeth Eisenstein has just come out with a damning review.

25:31.675 --> 25:31.956
Oh, really?

25:31.976 --> 25:32.076
Yeah.

25:32.236 --> 25:34.801
I just called her a book.

25:34.881 --> 25:36.945
Send me an email message that I can tell you where.

25:36.965 --> 25:37.886
I can't remember offhand where it was.

25:37.907 --> 25:39.129
It was in an academic journal.

25:39.149 --> 25:41.834
But she wouldn't be coming from the other side, though, wouldn't she?

25:41.854 --> 25:44.198
Well, she also disliked very heavily the

25:44.752 --> 25:52.866
the sort of Robert Downs and Paula Husser 18th century revision book culture.

25:52.886 --> 25:54.549
She doesn't really want much to do with that.

25:55.190 --> 26:00.579
It's a sort of problem for her because she wants to say the impact of printing changed the world.

26:00.599 --> 26:05.528
And all these people are saying, well actually you have to wait until the 18th century until these things took effect.

26:05.845 --> 26:28.275
so it couldn't have just been the technology so they're sort of a loggerhead and so and she takes a great deal of review taking color has of the past over what she said about the 18th the first revolution is in the history department

26:29.858 --> 26:53.807
I don't know how I'm going to get all of this into the book.

26:53.787 --> 27:07.760
So the overall book is going to be what I see as Harvard and Cornell.

27:08.061 --> 27:11.830
I told this story last night.

27:12.552 --> 27:30.621
I'm doing research into the... I'm doing some research in the 18th century business documents and records in Portugal.

27:30.882 --> 27:39.015
And I was sitting in this archive, this old stealthy room, with these boxes of letters.

27:40.008 --> 27:48.298
and I was sitting there reading them, and you pull them out, and they're dusty, and I get asthma, and I start to wheeze and sniff.

27:48.318 --> 27:55.728
They're incredibly hard to read, and you just sit there and you say, shit, if somebody had digitized these, and these were online, you know, my life would be heaven, you know.

27:55.748 --> 28:06.080
And the chap's sitting next to me with another box open inside of him, and he was sitting there, and he was putting his hand in, and he was pulling them out, and he was going, and putting them back in.

28:06.481 --> 28:09.745
And so I looked at him, and I said,

28:09.927 --> 28:11.890
You know, let's just tend to be cool.

28:11.910 --> 28:12.972
And I carried on reading.

28:13.253 --> 28:15.717
But he carried on doing this for 50 minutes.

28:15.737 --> 28:18.843
And he said, the inhibitions of my Portuguese just didn't stop.

28:18.863 --> 28:20.846
And I said, what are you doing?

28:21.888 --> 28:24.633
And he said, well, I'm a medical historian.

28:24.973 --> 28:28.780
And I'm interested in when there were outbreaks of cholera in Portugal.

28:29.249 --> 28:39.002
And when cholera came to Porto, the user came in off the ships, so the first thing that they would do if they suspected an outbreak is that they'd disinfect all the letters.

28:39.622 --> 28:41.445
And they would disinfect them with vinegar.

28:41.465 --> 28:47.152
And now, 200 years later, you can still smell vinegar on the records and know when cholera came to Porto.

28:47.973 --> 28:54.782
And so I thought, you know, this is what the material embodiment of information is all about.

28:55.223 --> 28:57.906
Because you could easily have scanned all those letters.

28:58.291 --> 29:02.896
And then I thought to a further, it's actually what the humanities are about.

29:02.916 --> 29:11.724
In a way, the way you work in the humanities, particularly in history, is that you sort of score by saying, I've noticed what you haven't noticed.

29:11.745 --> 29:19.472
You know, this guy's noticed the vinegar, which people have ignored for 200 years, has actually become an enormously significant data source for medical history.

29:19.492 --> 29:24.197
But if someone had said, what's interesting in those documents is what is scammable,

29:24.532 --> 29:31.759
So we'll scan them and destroy the documents.

29:31.779 --> 29:37.145
That peripheral data just disappears because nobody has noticed it.

29:37.165 --> 29:41.910
And the fact that the guy's scanning it says there's a strange smell of vinegar around here.

29:41.930 --> 29:47.635
This is in Portugal, in Porto, which is the city where Porto is made, yeah.

29:47.836 --> 29:49.137
O Porto is using it six months ago.

29:49.157 --> 29:49.257
Yeah.

29:49.642 --> 29:52.606
And what exactly was he looking at?

29:52.686 --> 29:58.533
Well, he was looking at letters that had been sent to an English port wine exporter.

29:58.733 --> 30:00.135
They still exist, Hunt Roof.

30:00.155 --> 30:06.222
And interestingly about studying these people, they've been in business for 15 generations.

30:06.302 --> 30:12.730
Hunt Roof letters, the letters that had come from England to Porter.

30:14.262 --> 30:24.883
The way in which they prevented power from coming in was that they paid the custom guys three mil rays, which is a tiny amount of matter, three rays, per letter to disinfect them.

30:25.083 --> 30:27.327
So these guys would very loudly disinfect them.

30:27.387 --> 30:31.275
And occasionally you'd look and they'd uphold from them because there'd been too much vinegar.

30:31.255 --> 30:39.877
But that was, you know, and so for me, I was reading what the companies in England were saying to the companies, to the wine exporters, you know.

30:39.938 --> 30:42.645
The wine's bad, you're being ripped off.

30:42.665 --> 30:46.294
But this guy was studying medical history from exactly the same record.

30:47.270 --> 31:00.885
But it was a question that if Cornell had got hold of these things and said, screw it, we can put these, you know, 56 huge, heavy, dusty boxes on, you know, a CD-ROM.

31:02.647 --> 31:09.835
You know, that's how I would explain the difference between that.

31:09.815 --> 31:23.871
And I think the next part of this, I'm hoping that the term will return.

31:23.891 --> 31:24.432
That seems bad, by the way.

31:24.968 --> 31:45.947
Some of it's very important.

31:45.967 --> 31:46.527
Some of it's very important.

31:46.547 --> 31:47.528
What they did with the Cambodia is extraordinary.

31:47.548 --> 31:48.049
I don't know how that is.

31:48.069 --> 31:48.569
I don't know how that is.

31:48.589 --> 31:49.370
It's destroying the whole national war.

31:49.390 --> 31:50.711
And it happens at $4 of great, great Southeast Asian luxury stuff.

31:50.731 --> 31:51.552
And they were able to break with the U.S.

31:51.572 --> 31:52.833
stuff and replicate things that were destroyed by the poor U.S.

31:52.853 --> 31:53.634
And it was with the guys' message here.

31:53.654 --> 31:54.054
And I saw other U.S.

31:54.074 --> 31:54.975
And also, I have to get a point of the place.

31:54.955 --> 32:20.545
They're documenting everything that they're doing, they're setting up guidelines, establishing criteria, it's all being documented.

32:20.565 --> 32:21.966
So, you know, like it or love it, you can't say that they're doing it.

32:21.986 --> 32:22.547
No, they are doing it, yeah.

32:22.567 --> 32:23.188
And they're very hard about it.

32:23.208 --> 32:23.528
But they were...

32:23.508 --> 32:43.332
I mean, the thing that you're saying is that they have decided that there is nothing more interesting that can be gained from these volumes than they have managed to catch on a scam.

32:43.412 --> 32:45.054
And that's the great presumption.

32:45.074 --> 32:47.637
We know all there is to know about this document.

32:47.917 --> 32:50.140
There's no need to look back at it again.

32:50.120 --> 33:02.003
Particularly if somebody's making emendations along the way, think of A. L. Rouse's identification of the dark ladies

33:02.641 --> 33:05.444
you know, Shakespeare's sonnets.

33:05.464 --> 33:06.225
So what does he do?

33:06.345 --> 33:06.766
He misreads the text.

33:06.786 --> 33:10.110
You know, Simon Fullman's diary said she was very brave.

33:10.130 --> 33:13.314
He reads it and transcribes it as she was very brown.

33:13.414 --> 33:16.958
And then says, this is the dark lady, and writes the book.

33:16.978 --> 33:24.507
And until someone can actually go back and look at the... I mean, I'm not an asinine piece of work that is.

33:24.527 --> 33:27.010
He's a historian who's read over Shakespearean scholars.

33:27.030 --> 33:29.813
But you see, he always says he knows more than Shakespearean scholars do.

33:29.793 --> 33:55.931
I mean, he's enormously arrogant in what he knows.

33:55.951 --> 33:56.312
Yeah, he's alive.

33:56.332 --> 33:57.033
Yeah, he's an extraordinary figure.

33:57.053 --> 33:57.373
Did he go alive?

33:57.393 --> 33:57.734
Yeah, I could go.

33:57.754 --> 33:58.635
I think that whole thing is, you know, we...

33:58.615 --> 34:06.807
We now can decide what we need to keep from these documents and what to discard.

34:06.827 --> 34:16.222
The great thing about scanning is that probably 90% of the people who ever need those documents will really just want a rough scan of the text, and that's fine.

34:16.482 --> 34:22.591
Scanning is great, but there's nothing implicit in the scanning that says you have to destroy what you scan from.

34:22.611 --> 34:23.172
That's the discount.

34:23.455 --> 34:34.368
I mean, you know, the Goldsmith Press Library has these great microfilms.

34:34.388 --> 34:44.620
And for 90% of what you ever want to do with a book in Goldsmith Press, a microfilm is going to be, you know, 99%, a microfilm is going to be great.

34:44.640 --> 34:49.325
But what if they'd microfilmed the Goldsmith Press collection and said, look, we're pushing the space and have the scarlet and burn the leather there.

34:49.345 --> 34:49.826
Amazing.

34:49.886 --> 34:50.967
That second decision is the one that really is.

34:50.987 --> 34:51.808
In that book there's a future book there.

34:52.362 --> 34:56.648
The feature of the book, yeah.

34:56.788 --> 34:59.873
What do you make of this type of this?

35:00.053 --> 35:03.758
The hypertext?

35:03.778 --> 35:03.879
Yeah.

35:03.899 --> 35:04.700
Something, is it?

35:04.720 --> 35:22.285
Yeah, I mean, it seems to me that, you know, for me the odd thing about hypertext, and in fact I write a bit about it in my essay in there, I sort of slightly take on Landau, is this strange assumption

35:23.193 --> 35:36.374
which in a way I mean you and I know that in a sense that writing is a sort of fundamentally deceptive object and pulling it apart is the real effort that you should put into life.

35:37.256 --> 35:40.020
Whereas the effort of putting it together

35:40.726 --> 35:49.739
is so important in how, you know, it's sort of the same thing as suggesting that, you know, photography is just a matter of remembering to take the lens cap off.

35:49.919 --> 36:00.876
You know, and that writing is this sort of, this veridical reflection of a deceptive world, and what we need to do is break writing up so that nobody believes the world is like that.

36:00.896 --> 36:05.282
Which seems to me such a profound misunderstanding of what narrative is about.

36:05.262 --> 36:28.453
I mean, even what you were saying a few minutes ago, is that there's a way that you want to tell a story, because in the way you tell it, you know, there are certain ends that you can achieve.

36:28.473 --> 36:30.315
And then it's, you know, it's a choice of methods, and, you know, narrative plays that role.

36:30.335 --> 36:31.877
I mean, this transcript of this interview, I don't know what I can say here.

36:31.897 --> 36:32.438
No way I'm going to use it.

36:32.458 --> 36:32.818
Of everybody here.

36:32.838 --> 36:33.379
There's a sergeant process.

36:33.359 --> 36:54.551
And that's my only set of standards.

36:54.571 --> 36:59.198
And where I think, you know, where hypertexts can do great things is if, you know, you're not going to do this, but where, you know, the story on cocaine and the San Jose Mercury, you have a narrative story and then you have links.

36:59.600 --> 37:06.171
to a broad hypertext database of the data from which you constructed the story.

37:06.311 --> 37:07.994
Well, that's great, it seems to me.

37:08.094 --> 37:22.959
But the notion that you just do away with narrative and leave everybody with this unrefined job, and that you're helping anybody out, or achieving anything of any significance, just seems to me bonkers.

37:22.979 --> 37:25.303
Just seems to me absolutely bonkers.

37:25.283 --> 37:39.626
You may not remember me, but... He did, because I said I was going to meet you.

37:39.646 --> 37:39.907
Yeah, he did.

37:39.927 --> 37:40.608
Yeah, and he'd read the book, too.

37:40.628 --> 37:40.888
I did, I did.

37:40.908 --> 37:41.209
And enjoyed it.

37:41.229 --> 37:42.591
That was an excellent interview I had with about an hour and a half.

37:42.611 --> 37:43.292
Yeah, it was very similar to that.

37:43.272 --> 37:59.054
That would be great.

37:59.074 --> 37:59.475
That would be great.

37:59.455 --> 38:26.868
Yes.

38:26.888 --> 38:26.968
Yes.

38:26.988 --> 38:27.068
Yes.

38:27.088 --> 38:27.168
Yes.

38:27.188 --> 38:27.268
Yes.

38:27.248 --> 38:39.267
i get an interview of marie sunday cambridge collection of the cycle adversarial which are the books it's in the um

38:39.618 --> 38:46.847
I wish I had a memory that could hold things.

38:46.908 --> 38:53.096
They have kept their collection of their annotated books together as a separate collection.

38:53.716 --> 38:58.723
There's someone who writes about it.

38:58.703 --> 39:16.452
Which again, I can drop down the reference on email.

39:16.472 --> 39:16.672
Thank you.

39:16.692 --> 39:17.133
That's very important.

39:17.153 --> 39:18.094
Yeah, okay, I need the piece of paper.

39:18.114 --> 39:18.675
Yeah, just to remind myself.

39:18.695 --> 39:19.497
They call it the adversarial collection.

39:19.517 --> 39:20.478
Adversarial, the old Latin name for annotations.

39:20.498 --> 39:21.420
Because they're sort of adversarial at a time.

39:21.440 --> 39:22.922
You know, it's interesting to interrupt other annual meetings this summer.

39:22.902 --> 39:23.623
Really?

39:23.844 --> 39:31.478
Yeah, that's right, they do, because I'm on the sharp list.

39:32.961 --> 39:34.143
Adversaria.

39:34.243 --> 39:35.565
Adversaria.

39:35.585 --> 39:37.609
Defending in an A, the Latin word.

39:37.629 --> 39:38.811
Adversaria.

39:43.260 --> 39:44.402
Yeah.

39:44.422 --> 39:44.522
Um...

39:44.502 --> 39:48.127
And there was something else I said.

39:48.147 --> 39:49.729
No, that was last night.

39:49.909 --> 39:53.754
That was the whole thing of why we had a confusion about last night.

39:53.774 --> 39:55.056
I gave the talks last night.

39:55.517 --> 40:09.936
That was why the class with Melissa... Yeah, I thought you and Melissa had sort of sort of thought about the information futures, where they have the university extension

40:09.916 --> 40:26.279
planned a program for librarians who are sort of concerned with, interested about, you know, what the future holds for them, the future of librarianship, the future of their own collections, you know, how technology is affecting it.

40:26.939 --> 40:32.447
And it'll go on until Wednesday.

40:32.427 --> 40:48.630
Yeah, and so I think today they're spending at the UC Extension in the city and tomorrow they'll be in Berkeley where a number of people from the School of Information Management are giving them different sort of show and tell.

40:48.610 --> 41:02.715
Well, at the moment it's only notes, but I have to write it up for them, so when I do, I'll either send it to you or I'll let you know where it's available online.

41:03.116 --> 41:12.393
Oh, I'm going to deal with it in the next couple of weeks.

41:12.553 --> 41:13.234
Okay.

41:13.687 --> 41:21.075
I mean, there I was talking more about sort of, you know, what to learn from disasters.

41:21.095 --> 41:22.396
Sorry about that.

41:22.436 --> 41:23.037
No, not at all.

41:25.159 --> 41:25.439
Thank you.

41:25.459 --> 41:28.983
I'll send you the reference to the adversary, I think.

41:29.003 --> 41:38.834
There's another... I think we ought to go.

41:38.854 --> 41:41.196
It sounded good.

41:41.176 --> 41:52.673
Maybe it'll come back to me probably.

41:52.913 --> 41:58.662
Yeah, that's in material matters.

42:00.025 --> 42:02.490
But you should, if you can, get in touch with Carla.

42:02.611 --> 42:03.272
Carla has her.

42:03.753 --> 42:05.457
Because she's very interesting.

42:05.878 --> 42:08.825
And what department is she going to do?

42:11.450 --> 42:12.092
She's in the history department.

42:12.112 --> 42:14.457
I'd love to spend all day here like that.
