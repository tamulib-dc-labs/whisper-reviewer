00:02.663 --> 00:07.370
You mentioned the National Digital Library.

00:07.470 --> 00:16.663
Well, the National Digital Library project at the Library of Congress is our major digitization effort.

00:16.683 --> 00:23.212
The overall goal is to digitize five million items by the year 2000.

00:23.313 --> 00:23.873
Five million.

00:24.254 --> 00:26.157
Five million, which is the library.

00:26.197 --> 00:31.945
The year 2000 is the goal because that's our bicentennial, which will...

00:32.330 --> 00:34.893
Are these considered unique items?

00:34.913 --> 00:41.001
These are unique items from the Library of Congress's historical Americana collections right now.

00:41.081 --> 00:42.763
Five million unique items.

00:42.803 --> 00:43.444
Amazing.

00:43.464 --> 00:43.885
Right.

00:45.106 --> 00:47.770
Could you characterize them?

00:47.970 --> 00:48.831
Well, yeah, I can.

00:48.871 --> 00:55.179
The examples, and I'll show you the sheet off which we're working, of collections.

00:55.199 --> 00:57.903
These are big chunks of research collections.

00:57.923 --> 00:59.805
For example, the...

00:59.903 --> 01:11.441
photographs of the Depression years, the OWI, Office of War Information, Farm Security Administration photographs, the famous Roy Stryker, Dorothea Lange, all of those.

01:12.182 --> 01:19.313
That's a collection that's being given to the world through the Internet, through the digital library project.

01:19.580 --> 01:45.435
and as i've said when that goes up on the library home page we also have a learning page of educators who are working on ways to get kids k-12 to make use of this and put it into a broader context an educational context the center for the book is in fact working with these educators to help do that our contribution is really reading this but they're doing

01:45.854 --> 01:46.758
Much more.

01:48.144 --> 01:50.816
By and large, books are not being digitized.

01:50.836 --> 01:55.577
By and large, these are special collections of manuscripts, of maps.

01:56.097 --> 02:00.606
Another example would be the Civil War photographs from the Library of Congress.

02:00.686 --> 02:06.178
Another example would be Detroit Publishing Company's photographic collections.

02:06.719 --> 02:17.361
Manuscripts from the WPA, again, which was a government-sponsored project, so it belongs to us, the government.

02:17.381 --> 02:17.481
Sure.

02:17.714 --> 02:19.998
These first-person narratives.

02:20.239 --> 02:25.669
And so this is part of your holdings in the National Archives.

02:25.749 --> 02:28.193
These are our holdings.

02:28.213 --> 02:29.836
We're not digitizing theirs.

02:32.341 --> 02:40.937
You know, since Archives wasn't created until 1935, we in effect also were the National Archives up until...

02:41.120 --> 02:43.524
Really, 1950.

02:43.965 --> 02:48.833
And as you said before, you put on the paper putter, you were also the repository for presidential papers.

02:49.153 --> 02:49.614
That's right.

02:49.634 --> 02:54.001
Before the presidential... Well, I think it's up to FDR, to the Hyde Park Library.

02:54.142 --> 02:55.203
We go through Coolidge.

02:56.826 --> 02:59.611
And Hoover, of course, has his own.

02:59.671 --> 03:02.536
It's up really to Hoover, I guess.

03:02.776 --> 03:05.220
But we've gotten money...

03:06.078 --> 03:11.394
for the digital library, specifically now to digitize some manuscript collectors.

03:11.534 --> 03:14.704
Reuters, for example, gave us a million dollars to digitize

03:15.207 --> 03:20.132
the Washington and the Jefferson papers.

03:20.312 --> 03:21.853
Reuters.

03:21.874 --> 03:25.037
The news service.

03:25.057 --> 03:29.841
The digital library, the estimate is that it's a $60 million project.

03:30.302 --> 03:31.383
Isn't that a British outfit?

03:32.083 --> 03:34.125
Yeah, but they have... Yes, they are.

03:34.206 --> 03:42.794
That's their... But they're also interested in... I mean, they're based here as well.

03:42.834 --> 03:43.915
But the overall...

03:44.536 --> 03:46.159
The cost is $60 million.

03:46.219 --> 04:06.831
About $45 million is coming from the private sector, and Mr. Gingrich likes this project, and the agreement is that over a five-year period, the Congress will provide roughly $15 million, $3 million a year for this project.

04:07.081 --> 04:11.126
But you'll get more from Dr. Billington.

04:11.326 --> 04:12.087
You have your lunch.

04:12.428 --> 04:22.681
You and I. I certainly think it behooves me to get some quotes from the library.

04:23.361 --> 04:32.293
And I've spent time with Paul Beclair at the New York Public, and I was out at the San Francisco Public Library a couple weeks ago.

04:32.333 --> 04:34.135
I'm going up to Cornell next week.

04:34.672 --> 04:36.113
I'm going to write about Sarajevo.

04:36.134 --> 04:45.083
I'm going to write about Cornell's effort to try and replenish the lost collections in Cambodia, which nobody really knows anything about.

04:45.523 --> 04:48.306
I'm really interested in technology, the canon wars.

04:48.426 --> 04:54.192
I'm just a very discressive kind of book, not unlike this one.

04:54.212 --> 04:57.215
I mean, I really write about the things that engage me.

04:57.235 --> 05:00.459
I research it to death, and I do a lot of interviews.

05:00.479 --> 05:04.543
Well, I can think of two or three stories attached with the library that you might want to

05:04.608 --> 05:05.469
want to look into.

05:05.710 --> 05:10.196
One would be the largest library fire in history.

05:10.216 --> 05:22.635
It was in Leningrad in 1988, February 1988, and destroyed, what, 400,000 books completely, and water damaged 3 million.

05:24.417 --> 05:34.412
And Peter Waters, who's in our preservation department, I got raised some money for it.

05:34.747 --> 05:37.690
immediately got some money from the Regis Digest Foundation.

05:37.711 --> 05:45.640
And we went over there with Peter, and they designed a kind of phased conservation program for them.

05:46.641 --> 05:50.486
He'd done the same thing with the Los Angeles Fire, which is a much smaller library fire.

05:50.566 --> 06:01.699
So library fires and the obligation of, I think the Library of Congress has a pretty honorable role in trying to help people that have been fire damaged.

06:02.118 --> 06:13.273
Another example would be Kuwait, the National Library of Kuwait, which has been partly refitted out of the duplicate collections in our Cairo office.

06:13.353 --> 06:14.694
We have these overseas offices.

06:14.795 --> 06:16.777
Now duplicate, what kinds of items?

06:17.518 --> 06:17.879
English?

06:18.019 --> 06:20.602
No, we're the largest Arabic language library in the world.

06:20.622 --> 06:23.987
So they lost their own... They lost their own library.

06:24.928 --> 06:27.651
So you basically replenished... Well, we're helping replenish it.

06:27.671 --> 06:32.057
I mean, you can't do it all, but we're providing a number of key elements for it.

06:32.864 --> 06:39.594
But that's because we actually have Arab duplicates in our Cairo office.

06:40.315 --> 06:52.693
That leads in turn to the story of our overseas offices, which where in third world countries where there's no book trade or where there's an inadequately developed book trade, we do the basic purchasing.

06:52.954 --> 07:02.027
I mean, you're going to see Cornell talk about the Southeast Asian thing, but they are one of the customers for our

07:02.142 --> 07:06.106
Jakarta office, which does Southeast Asia purchasing.

07:06.126 --> 07:06.967
That is interesting.

07:06.987 --> 07:11.992
John was mentioning today that you have half a dozen field offices, I guess.

07:12.012 --> 07:12.353
Yeah.

07:12.373 --> 07:16.717
Well, Susan Thomas, who is now the new librarian at Cornell, used to be here with us.

07:16.758 --> 07:18.039
She was head of cataloging here.

07:18.139 --> 07:18.900
Sarah Thomas.

07:18.920 --> 07:19.641
I mean, Sarah Thomas.

07:19.661 --> 07:20.061
What did I say?

07:20.081 --> 07:20.381
Susan?

07:20.401 --> 07:20.862
Yeah.

07:20.882 --> 07:23.204
I'll probably meet her next week.

07:23.264 --> 07:23.685
You will.

07:23.885 --> 07:24.225
Sarah.

07:24.265 --> 07:31.373
No, she's very, and she knows a lot about library, because she can tell you a lot about the Library of Congress, too.

07:32.078 --> 07:41.010
Anyhow, those are just some examples that come to mind on that front, because I think the... You mentioned Pergamon.

07:41.051 --> 07:49.843
Of course, Pergamon... I think Pergamon's the most haunting site of classical antiquity in the Mediterranean Basin.

07:49.863 --> 07:52.987
To me, it beats everything in Greece or Italy.

07:53.328 --> 07:54.910
And why is that?

07:54.930 --> 07:57.734
Well, just if you go there, you'll see what I mean.

07:57.794 --> 08:00.077
First of all...

08:01.272 --> 08:02.713
It's the most spectacular theater.

08:02.793 --> 08:03.975
It opens up.

08:03.995 --> 08:08.819
It's very high over the wine-dark sea, as Homer called it.

08:09.960 --> 08:13.243
And you can sort of sense the whole thing.

08:13.283 --> 08:19.730
Of course, the Anatolian ruins are the greatest Ephesus I've been to.

08:19.750 --> 08:23.934
Ephesus is grander in the sense that it's a huge city there.

08:23.994 --> 08:27.197
You can really see the dimensions of it.

08:27.217 --> 08:29.659
But pergolum is a jewel.

08:30.837 --> 08:33.283
jewel, Ephesus is a feast.

08:36.250 --> 08:45.131
But Pergamon, and particularly the theater, you see there's no trace of, of course, parchment comes from Pergamon, we assume.

08:45.151 --> 08:47.918
And of course, the library was

08:48.235 --> 08:51.038
completely gutted because of the Alexandria fire.

08:51.058 --> 08:54.260
Cleopatra got the... I have it in my book, chapter two.

08:54.280 --> 08:58.244
Okay, well, I haven't read that, but I use it in a speech.

08:58.384 --> 09:00.866
I use this as an example, a speech of my own.

09:00.886 --> 09:02.748
It was a gift to the girlfriend, basically.

09:02.908 --> 09:07.593
Taking it all from replacing what was lost in the fire, and so forth.

09:07.873 --> 09:11.076
But what you can get a sense of is two things.

09:11.236 --> 09:15.880
One is the attempt to cure the

09:16.400 --> 09:25.088
the body, the whole complex baths and system of sort of health exercises.

09:25.108 --> 09:45.225
But the really impressive thing is the theater, because the background plays seem to have been acted with a backdrop of a sheer drop into the thing, so that you can see the Greek tragedies being acted over a cliff somehow, and this spectacular view of the backdrop, instead of having a

09:45.560 --> 09:50.905
scenery, you just have the vast Mediterranean spreading out all the way to Sicily.

09:50.985 --> 09:53.448
You don't quite see that far, but you sort of think you are.

09:53.568 --> 09:54.149
Well, that's great.

09:54.169 --> 09:59.934
That's a good, useful quote, because this opening chapter is really going to be almost a little travel on.

09:59.954 --> 10:06.201
But they suggest the continuum through the centuries and the contribution of each place.

10:06.661 --> 10:13.047
Unfortunately, there's no rec left in Alexandria, although they are building a new library there, as you guys mentioned.

10:13.067 --> 10:14.689
But that has nothing to do with

10:15.057 --> 10:17.100
with the ancient library.

10:17.921 --> 10:20.344
John kindly showed me around today.

10:20.404 --> 10:25.170
It took me to where we saw some scanning going on with some maps.

10:25.470 --> 10:31.298
And they gave me a brief introduction to this National Digital Library that you're working on.

10:31.378 --> 10:39.408
And of course, a concluding chapter of this book will deal with libraries of the future, this debate that's going on about print culture.

10:39.469 --> 10:43.714
And I wonder if you have any thoughts on the eve of this new millennium

10:44.285 --> 11:00.087
You know, as the nation's librarian— Well, I think you ought to know what we're doing at the— I mean, I have very few thoughts independently of what the Library of Congress is doing right now, because I'm kind of 100 percent involved in the life of the institution.

11:00.107 --> 11:04.112
But what we are doing—we are not digitizing books, basically.

11:04.132 --> 11:06.616
We're digitizing special material.

11:06.656 --> 11:13.245
What we're really doing is trying to use digitization to bring special materials into the world of books.

11:14.508 --> 11:16.930
They've always been physically in libraries.

11:17.110 --> 11:37.069
I mean, libraries have always had maps, or not all libraries, but the larger the library, the more likely they are to have special collections, documentary photographs, maps, posters, cartoons, broadsides, and, of course, manuscript materials, maybe recorded sound movies, that kind of thing.

11:39.191 --> 11:41.393
The non-book materials.

11:42.014 --> 11:45.979
Now, the Library of Congress has enormous collections at this time.

11:46.139 --> 11:50.784
Two-thirds of our items are non-book items.

11:51.205 --> 11:53.988
Maybe even more than that, depends how you compute it.

11:54.008 --> 12:06.602
But that sort of material, the books and periodicals have always been accessible because books, of course, were an enormous democratizing factor.

12:06.622 --> 12:10.587
The portable book, as distinguished from the great Clovial volumes,

12:11.140 --> 12:17.727
were designed to be taken out and widely distributed in and out of libraries and so forth.

12:17.867 --> 12:31.523
But the special materials are usually only in one copy, whether it's a manuscript or a map or whatever, and they've not been widely available in their original artifactual form, unlike books.

12:32.264 --> 12:38.110
But by digitizing them, you can make them available in compact and accessible

12:38.478 --> 12:45.029
so that they're really available not just for research but for the curious, for the interested mind.

12:45.610 --> 12:47.994
And they can be searched, played with, and so forth.

12:48.015 --> 12:50.399
They can be browsed electronically.

12:50.439 --> 13:03.321
And basically you bring them into the world of books in the sense that you bring them into the world of interactivity where an investment of the person's

13:05.157 --> 13:07.660
active thinking is involved as it is in reading.

13:07.700 --> 13:17.452
You don't, unlike television, say, which is totally passive, and it feels basically to the, increasingly activates the emotions rather than the intellect.

13:19.094 --> 13:28.726
You have to use your mind to use an archival resource like this, but it brings that into the world.

13:28.766 --> 13:33.392
The books, and our image of it, is that the first instance goes into libraries and schools,

13:33.878 --> 13:51.977
where there are books, and where there are teachers, and where the interaction between people and books, where the people and ideas is contained in books, and where the ultimate value is a train of thought rather than a bumper car of emotion, all that is what we're trying to do with the digital library.

13:52.057 --> 13:57.303
We are not trying to replace the traditional print culture with a new culture.

13:57.363 --> 14:01.607
We're trying to add something which can't be avoided

14:02.043 --> 14:16.708
In any case, this is the way, I mean, at the National Library of the United States, we have to stockpile information and knowledge, however it's packaged, for the government of the United States and for the scholarly community.

14:16.728 --> 14:25.122
So we couldn't avoid, because we'll soon be getting deposits in digital form, anyhow, we couldn't avoid the digital revolution even if we wanted to.

14:25.142 --> 14:25.823
We thought we should.

14:26.647 --> 14:31.354
Because this is the way more and more knowledge is being packaged, more and more information is being communicated.

14:31.374 --> 14:36.261
And so we have to stockpile it in some sense.

14:36.281 --> 14:47.338
But we're also creating it because we want to extend the basic library principle of access to materials to extend it beyond Washington and beyond

14:47.960 --> 15:01.201
just the classical mode of interlibrary loan or the simple duplication or Xeroxing of a few pages of an article or a book.

15:01.822 --> 15:07.250
We want to make this other stuff available and bring it into the world.

15:07.791 --> 15:13.039
Do you foresee a time when scholars will not have access to the primary

15:14.150 --> 15:19.639
material that they will only be allowed, say, to use digitized copies?

15:19.659 --> 15:21.162
Well, I hope not.

15:21.643 --> 15:26.431
I mean, I think that would be a dangerous step for democracy to put itself into.

15:26.652 --> 15:33.323
I mean, I don't want to see that kind of power in anybody's hands with a switch.

15:33.995 --> 15:39.965
So, but I think that there is essential, I think, to handle the original document.

15:39.985 --> 15:44.452
Yeah, I think it's, well, we're not, when anything we digitize, we don't throw away the original.

15:44.472 --> 15:45.173
A lot of people do.

15:45.193 --> 15:48.459
But in terms of access, though, you don't then deny access?

15:48.479 --> 15:50.021
No, no, no, we don't deny access.

15:50.202 --> 15:58.355
I mean, we've had to restrict access to the stacks, but we haven't restricted access to the books or to the lectures.

15:58.375 --> 15:59.597
The lectures.

15:59.712 --> 16:03.536
And you oversee that kind of thought that comes to mind.

16:03.576 --> 16:06.780
No, no, no, not over my dead body.

16:07.080 --> 16:09.222
That's a good quote, but I'll use it too.

16:09.242 --> 16:09.663
You can't.

16:10.764 --> 16:14.688
We're not going to, I mean, there's no point having this stuff if it isn't available.

16:15.749 --> 16:28.183
And also, it's important, not just for the expert, but for everybody to be in touch with the, I mean, I think there's an intrinsic

16:28.484 --> 16:32.649
value to being in touch with the original artifact.

16:33.030 --> 16:36.654
But there's also an extrinsic value as well, and you've got to preserve bold.

16:37.175 --> 16:42.442
Stephen Jay Gould tells me that he really can't write from facsimile.

16:42.462 --> 16:46.387
Maybe it's a mystical kind of a thing or some sort of transference.

16:46.427 --> 16:50.512
But he said, I have to handle the manuscript.

16:50.632 --> 16:53.476
I have to handle the original manuscript or the book.

16:53.496 --> 16:54.998
He likes the whole first edition.

16:55.737 --> 16:59.762
Yeah, I think the book's going to be around for a long time, and I think there are a lot of materials.

17:00.183 --> 17:24.816
My own sort of general anticipation is that if our evolution is relatively rational, which is by no means guaranteed in the human species, would be that a lot of things that used to be in books, I mean, World Almanac types of information,

17:25.319 --> 17:29.082
That'll be all online because it'll be constantly updated.

17:29.102 --> 17:42.314
And you don't, by the time, I mean, most books which basically contain it in part up-to-date information are out-of-date by the time they're printed, even in a fast printing operation.

17:42.334 --> 17:50.341
I was out at Stanford a couple of weeks ago, and the press there is actually publishing very technical journals strictly online.

17:50.581 --> 17:52.602
I mean, there will be no printed books.

17:53.103 --> 17:54.364
And they argue, well, look,

17:55.103 --> 18:00.491
In the best instance, you might sell 600 copies of this thing, and they're going to cost $150 a volume.

18:00.932 --> 18:03.155
And they're obsolete the day they're issued anyway.

18:03.335 --> 18:05.819
And now I can see that as a decided advantage.

18:05.839 --> 18:08.583
Well, I think what you're going to see is the great hope.

18:08.663 --> 18:10.867
And this is one of my hopes for the Library of Congress.

18:10.887 --> 18:17.717
It's something I haven't talked to somebody new even to John, who's collecting memory of the Library of Congress.

18:17.817 --> 18:20.301
But one of the things that I see

18:20.720 --> 18:23.364
the revolution, freeing up books to become.

18:23.384 --> 18:30.715
There has been a degradation of the book in the last 30 years or 40 years by the academic monograph.

18:32.657 --> 18:40.990
There has been a, because of hyper-specialization and the bureaucratization.

18:41.030 --> 18:41.691
Thanks.

18:41.751 --> 18:42.993
Where did I leave it, Janet?

18:43.013 --> 18:43.734
In the car.

18:43.754 --> 18:44.254
In the car?

18:44.274 --> 18:44.975
Oh, my goodness.

18:44.995 --> 18:45.757
Well, I shouldn't have.

18:45.977 --> 18:49.923
What an indignity for you to have to get my apology.

18:49.943 --> 18:50.203
I'm so tired.

18:51.297 --> 18:55.421
We tax Janet's patients.

18:56.101 --> 18:58.744
Thank you very much, Janet.

18:59.324 --> 19:00.145
I apologize.

19:00.165 --> 19:01.146
That was really stupid.

19:01.166 --> 19:02.327
I could have sworn I brought it in.

19:04.629 --> 19:10.294
But what you're seeing, and that's a different kind of thing.

19:10.314 --> 19:14.378
I think, first of all, data and information is going to be transmitted online.

19:14.438 --> 19:15.999
It will be very inefficiently.

19:16.039 --> 19:19.903
It's always been inefficiently packaged in books, and that will be almost entirely done.

19:19.923 --> 19:20.443
So a lot of

19:20.980 --> 19:23.803
books that are just containing data and information, those will be.

19:23.843 --> 19:38.641
But now we're talking about the more serious type of books, which contain sort of histories, biographies, novels, poetry, the serious kind of traditional literature that has always been in book form.

19:40.324 --> 19:50.616
That's going to be freed up from the burden, from book publishing, in effect,

19:51.423 --> 20:13.975
playing a role in the certification of the academic guilds by struggling things into publication that are always of very limited interest, that are written in jargon for a narrow audience, that aren't written in a language that enriches and improves and extends the human condition, but are merely written in kind of bad functional forms of communication among experts.

20:14.616 --> 20:16.299
That stuff should go online.

20:16.839 --> 20:20.805
And that's going to help academia, because much more of it, there's a real...

20:21.376 --> 20:27.321
There's a real divide in academia between those who get their books published and those who don't.

20:27.982 --> 20:37.210
So there's an unfair sorting out of academia because a lot of wonderful PhD theses never get published.

20:37.630 --> 20:39.152
A lot of lousy ones do.

20:40.473 --> 20:46.478
And that's a totally irrational process for its functionality in academia.

20:48.019 --> 20:51.062
But in terms of enriching the general culture

20:51.380 --> 21:00.231
of the country, and appealing to a broader audience which never reads any of these academic monographs, the ones published or unpublished.

21:01.293 --> 21:16.712
So you'll get much more available because it'll be available online, and you'll have much less artificial gradations on the basis of what gets published and who's able to kind of, who's fashionable with these academic guilds.

21:17.890 --> 21:24.739
So you get much less pomposity and much more democracy in academia and among the specialized guilds.

21:25.460 --> 21:38.457
On the other hand, you will then free up the publishing world to become things which they have not on the whole been, things which are synthetic, that put things together rather than just take them apart.

21:39.178 --> 21:44.245
The whole business of what the great word used in the think tanks is disaggregate.

21:44.425 --> 21:45.687
Everything is disaggregated.

21:45.827 --> 21:47.509
That means it's turned into numbers.

21:48.063 --> 21:50.646
Of course, digitization is turning letters into numbers.

21:50.686 --> 21:53.869
You turn words into letters and then letters into numbers.

21:54.870 --> 21:56.953
You turn everything into numbers, zeros and ones.

21:57.093 --> 21:59.295
Only two numbers, zeros and ones, you see.

21:59.876 --> 22:03.740
So the question is, there are two questions.

22:04.120 --> 22:17.715
What should never be subjected to this process and should be written and in a form where one

22:17.999 --> 22:23.084
Coherent mind is communicating with another coherent mind, which is what books really are.

22:23.345 --> 22:25.787
Books really put things together between two covers.

22:25.827 --> 22:26.628
There's a finality.

22:27.249 --> 22:28.250
There's a kind of unity.

22:28.290 --> 22:30.232
There's a kind of synthesis involved in a book.

22:30.292 --> 22:31.513
Your book's a good example.

22:31.533 --> 22:38.621
You take a lot of different kinds of information and material, and it has a coherence and an interest.

22:39.682 --> 22:41.544
And it's one mind working.

22:41.564 --> 22:46.369
There are very few good books that are the product of committees.

22:46.872 --> 22:49.496
The King James Bible comes to mind.

22:49.777 --> 22:51.259
That's probably the one example.

22:52.501 --> 23:02.118
Well, if you have both shared belief and a shared culture of language, you can produce that.

23:02.138 --> 23:08.408
There are other prices— That's my only—actually, that's the only

23:08.793 --> 23:14.621
Well, we're not sure it was really a committee.

23:14.681 --> 23:19.288
I mean, I don't think a committee would have cleared some of that language.

23:19.328 --> 23:22.232
You always lose metaphors in a committee.

23:23.454 --> 23:28.901
Anyhow, it's a good point, though.

23:31.264 --> 23:35.931
What we will hope to get, what I hope we can get in the Library of Congress, I mean, there are

23:36.417 --> 23:36.978
Two things.

23:37.258 --> 23:39.421
We have to be in the digital revolution.

23:39.441 --> 23:48.732
We have to share more of what we have here that's been stored in taxpayer access with more people or where the taxpayers aren't going to continue to fund it.

23:49.653 --> 23:53.498
So we have both a moral and practical obligation to do this.

23:55.160 --> 23:56.521
We also have a possibility.

23:56.562 --> 23:59.886
This is what is on the horizon for us.

24:01.968 --> 24:05.192
We have a possibility of encouraging and fostering

24:05.780 --> 24:32.778
with the reopening of this building, and by making internally our special collections more available, and by turning more of our people into knowledge navigators from being just processors and technical people, we have the possibility of fostering a kind of synthetic scholarship that the universities were set up to produce but no longer do, since there are no educational ideas in universities.

24:32.979 --> 24:35.382
They're simply factories.

24:35.783 --> 24:45.217
you know, huge bureaucracies administering feudal dukdoms with their own private languages.

24:45.257 --> 24:49.203
They're not really basically contributing to the common culture.

24:49.223 --> 24:53.169
So it opens up an opportunity for your library.

24:53.189 --> 25:03.664
It's a library like the Republic and a guy like Paul, who is a person of considerable culture himself.

25:04.150 --> 25:24.338
and other large libraries, Boston Public, as well as some of your great university libraries, have a capacity to be places where you get back into what I like to use, this phrase from Keats about silence is slow time.

25:24.538 --> 25:27.983
That's what reading is, and that's what thinking is.

25:28.925 --> 25:32.790
And so you get a chance to slow down the onrush, the digital stuff,

25:33.783 --> 25:39.529
is not the onrush of megabytes and miniseconds and all that kind of stuff.

25:39.549 --> 25:48.399
It's basically making a lot of this stuff available back for browsing and thinking in a context where the books are also present.

25:48.439 --> 25:53.445
So you can start making connections between different formats of expression.

25:53.465 --> 25:56.488
You can start again putting things together rather than just taking them apart.

25:57.109 --> 26:00.633
And so you have more books that put things together rather than take them apart.

26:00.713 --> 26:01.714
Most books now

26:01.947 --> 26:04.110
These are academic books that take things apart.

26:04.190 --> 26:06.013
They're super specialized.

26:06.033 --> 26:08.176
Or they're scandal books that take people apart.

26:09.638 --> 26:19.994
I mean, if you look at what the bestsellers are, these are technically, artifactually books.

26:20.014 --> 26:20.835
But, you know.

26:20.975 --> 26:24.781
The New York Times doesn't really review its own bestseller list.

26:24.801 --> 26:25.221
Yeah.

26:25.702 --> 26:27.084
Particularly in fiction.

26:27.104 --> 26:29.828
I mean, if you look at the top books, they don't even review them.

26:30.382 --> 26:44.858
So what I would hope is that we will, by the time I leave this place, we will have created an ambience that I don't expect the books to have been written, in which a new kind of book will be written.

26:44.918 --> 26:54.069
Not a new kind of book, actually an old kind of book will be written in a new age with a lot of new material and using a lot of languages and a lot of formats.

26:54.709 --> 26:59.595
But basically coming up with a kind of...

27:01.330 --> 27:04.974
creative wholeness that books ought to represent.

27:06.075 --> 27:28.217
And I think that if we can keep the internet from being too strictly censored, a lot of the garbage that's now in books scandals the stuff that's written around here about scandalizing this person and coming up with that bit of gossip about this person and that.

27:28.237 --> 27:30.780
I want to tell it because this collection

27:31.351 --> 27:37.100
I mean, I don't know that I should divulge people in this because I'm, you know, I'm the neutral.

27:37.120 --> 27:39.184
But this was during the SNL?

27:39.484 --> 27:42.068
SNL, there was a major conversation.

27:42.088 --> 27:43.731
I know the Magic Collection, of course.

27:43.831 --> 27:45.253
Well, that's one.

27:45.574 --> 27:46.515
David Copperfield.

27:46.555 --> 27:46.796
Yeah.

27:46.896 --> 27:54.929
One of the few cases where something that was, the RTC sold for twice as much than it was paid for.

27:54.949 --> 27:56.211
In the instance of books,

27:56.478 --> 27:58.520
The government actually got more money.

27:58.540 --> 28:03.684
That one they actually were able to sell, although his buying it meant that it was taken out of it.

28:03.704 --> 28:05.626
It could have been public access.

28:06.207 --> 28:07.968
But otherwise it would have been broken up and sold.

28:07.988 --> 28:08.729
Would have been broken up.

28:08.749 --> 28:13.854
At least there you had an individual buyer, but there are some cases where it didn't work out quite that well.

28:13.874 --> 28:25.624
But what I was going to say was the interesting, to me, it's important to me because this is the book collection out of which I grew.

28:26.718 --> 28:29.421
was a book collection that my father assembled.

28:29.441 --> 28:34.107
No first editions, no trophy books, all books that were read.

28:35.229 --> 28:41.577
They were, first of all, read by somebody else, because we could only afford, growing up, used books.

28:41.837 --> 28:43.559
I'm writing two books, by the way.

28:43.739 --> 28:45.822
One was about collecting like this.

28:49.246 --> 28:50.548
These were all used books.

28:51.085 --> 28:57.452
On the other hand, my father developed in his amateur sort of way a way of kind of restoring and so on.

28:57.533 --> 28:59.735
He would paste his own little labels on books.

28:59.795 --> 29:06.323
So they were loved the way a collector does, better than most collectors of expensive books.

29:06.343 --> 29:07.424
You still have these books?

29:08.185 --> 29:10.468
Well, not as many as I'd like, unfortunately.

29:10.488 --> 29:13.231
I have some of them, but not too many.

29:14.913 --> 29:16.835
Eclectic or focused?

29:16.855 --> 29:18.297
It was sort of focused.

29:18.377 --> 29:19.618
It had a certain focus.

29:19.699 --> 29:20.940
I mean, there were things he liked.

29:21.578 --> 29:28.628
And it was a sort of, it was a great late Victorian collection, basically.

29:28.728 --> 29:29.549
And did you enjoy it?

29:29.990 --> 29:30.631
Oh, yeah, no.

29:30.991 --> 29:32.433
Well, you enjoyed it for two reasons.

29:32.594 --> 29:36.659
One, but mainly because it was red.

29:36.699 --> 29:37.681
It wasn't decorative.

29:39.543 --> 29:40.525
It was in the living room.

29:40.825 --> 29:45.712
I mean, the house was built around my father's books and my mother's piano.

29:45.792 --> 29:46.693
That was the living room.

29:46.714 --> 29:47.194
Where was this?

29:47.214 --> 29:47.815
That's where we lived.

29:47.835 --> 29:49.718
This was in Norbert, Pennsylvania.

29:49.758 --> 29:49.898
Uh-huh.

29:50.587 --> 29:56.775
which is Philadelphia, really, just outside Philadelphia, but a very small house.

29:58.697 --> 30:04.805
Now, it was interesting because the used books from Leary's bookstore often were underlined, and that in itself was interesting.

30:04.985 --> 30:06.547
That's how I got interested in scholarship.

30:06.587 --> 30:08.329
Why do they underline this rather than that?

30:08.430 --> 30:10.793
I mean, I was always kind of curious.

30:10.813 --> 30:17.421
So you were always kind of guessing who the previous owner had been.

30:17.705 --> 30:18.446
Some of them weren't.

30:18.486 --> 30:23.334
I mean, I'm not doing him full justice because he occasionally got a really beautiful edition or something.

30:23.955 --> 30:27.761
But when he got a beautiful edition, it was appreciated.

30:27.861 --> 30:31.987
It was because it was sort of the exception rather than the rule.

30:33.109 --> 30:44.226
And, you know, I've been in so many fancy, since I've had this job, fancy libraries of people where, you know, just looking at books that I don't think any of them have ever read.

30:44.266 --> 30:45.248
I mean, it's a form of

30:45.515 --> 30:49.080
of decoration and investment.

30:49.380 --> 31:03.119
I quote Lawrence Rock's essay, and this is quite coincidental for the title of my book, but the chief end of book madness, which is the role that the collector has had in creating great collections.

31:03.740 --> 31:08.787
They come here, they go to New York Public, they go all over the country.

31:08.807 --> 31:10.830
That's kind of what I wrote about in there.

31:11.266 --> 31:11.647
Right.

31:11.767 --> 31:13.389
The productive end of the book is fake.

31:13.409 --> 31:40.868
But I mean, it's not very glamorous to describe something like this, but the fact of the matter is that if you have somebody who is not only collecting books, but is kind of reading and in a kind of perpetual state of browsing, and if that person happens to be your father, you have an enormous leg up on life.

31:41.135 --> 31:50.926
I mean, because, you know, he's just, he was just constantly saying, you know, this is, you know, listen to this poem, or, you know.

31:51.126 --> 31:52.007
What did your father do?

31:52.027 --> 31:54.129
He sold insurance.

31:54.149 --> 31:58.735
And he never, you know, went to college, never had really much of a formal education at all.

31:59.455 --> 32:04.361
But, and selling insurance is a tough business if you have contacts from college.

32:04.381 --> 32:09.927
So he, you know, he was sort of educated in the College of Foreign Arts, but he was, he was very, he was,

32:10.227 --> 32:14.835
Great reader, and he loved, and he was very eclectic, and he read all kinds of things.

32:14.855 --> 32:20.565
And some things he just got, because they were in the, in Leary's, they got downgraded.

32:20.585 --> 32:20.925
In Philly?

32:21.186 --> 32:21.747
Yeah, in Philly.

32:21.847 --> 32:24.371
One of the great used book stories of all time.

32:24.451 --> 32:27.316
I mean, the only one that's ever even close with foils in London.

32:27.336 --> 32:29.620
The old foils is distinguished from what it is now.

32:30.494 --> 32:34.780
And the one in Portland, Oregon, when we were out there, that's very impressive.

32:34.800 --> 32:35.240
That's right.

32:35.260 --> 32:36.142
That was very impressive.

32:36.182 --> 32:37.864
It was worth going out there just to see.

32:37.944 --> 32:39.326
I'm afraid they've modernized.

32:39.346 --> 32:41.288
They've become another crown bookstore.

32:41.349 --> 32:44.913
Not quite that they have as many new books as you've done.

32:44.933 --> 32:46.255
Expanded New York is fun.

32:46.335 --> 32:47.357
I don't know if you've been up to this.

32:47.377 --> 32:53.064
I haven't been there lately, but no, I've got to go just to reassure me that there's someplace where this happens.

32:53.144 --> 32:55.207
It's wonderful.

32:55.327 --> 32:57.550
But they don't do probably what Leary said.

32:57.570 --> 32:58.071
Leary's?

32:58.405 --> 32:59.807
was pretty rigorous.

33:01.749 --> 33:04.893
First of all, they'd let you completely alone, so you could read there all day.

33:04.953 --> 33:09.898
Nobody would put the slightest pressure on it, which my father basically did.

33:11.020 --> 33:16.266
He used the library too, but he loved Leary's because there was always the option of buying and taking it home.

33:17.687 --> 33:20.991
But after a while, they would put things in the dollar bin.

33:21.232 --> 33:27.619
Then after a couple of weeks in the dollar bin, they were rigorously put in the 50-cent bin and then the quarter bin.

33:27.852 --> 33:30.435
The system of knowledge dined.

33:30.935 --> 33:40.986
And so occasionally, you know, my father always makes elegant calculations about whether he'd take a gamble and wait at Cox's House of Wall Street in four volumes.

33:41.627 --> 33:47.173
It's going to survive the two weeks into the 50-cent bin or not.

33:47.193 --> 33:51.778
And, you know, this is... This is depression time.

33:51.858 --> 33:57.724
So, I mean, we're talking about, you know, a fairly... You know, I mean, I...

33:58.092 --> 34:00.476
I had never eaten a steak until I went to college.

34:00.576 --> 34:02.078
I didn't even know what a steak was.

34:02.098 --> 34:03.560
I mean, we had to eat once a week.

34:04.402 --> 34:06.245
I mean, we weren't hungry.

34:06.265 --> 34:06.846
You could go hungry.

34:06.866 --> 34:08.348
That turns out to have been a good diet.

34:10.211 --> 34:20.547
But, I mean, there was that kind of trade-off when he was buying books, so that it wasn't just some sort of gelatinous thing he did with extra money that he'd inherited from his parents.

34:20.627 --> 34:21.789
Do you have siblings in the house?

34:22.089 --> 34:23.391
Yeah, my brothers.

34:24.147 --> 34:28.173
professor of engineering at Princeton.

34:28.213 --> 34:30.697
So you acquired this love of books from your professor?

34:30.717 --> 34:31.338
Yeah, we both did.

34:31.398 --> 34:36.026
I mean, and we went into very different fields.

34:36.847 --> 34:39.411
Did he recommend books, or did he just kind of invite you?

34:39.431 --> 34:39.611
Oh, yeah.

34:39.631 --> 34:39.872
No, no, no.

34:39.892 --> 34:47.123
He would recommend books, and he would say, you know, he would recommend books that were very much out of fashion.

34:47.143 --> 34:48.906
They were already going out of fashion then.

34:49.679 --> 34:59.448
But the great characteristic of a kind of late Victorian library is, you know, you're at the end of the long tradition of the elegant use of the English language.

35:00.609 --> 35:05.074
And there's no substitute for reading this in these books.

35:05.174 --> 35:11.860
I mean, you know, you read Trollope, but then you read, I mean, things like The World of William Plissel by H.G.

35:11.880 --> 35:14.983
Wells, all this kind of late Victorian stuff, which is everybody.

35:15.043 --> 35:18.927
I mean, critics say it's terrible, you know, it's all...

35:19.312 --> 35:48.171
and everything of Galsworthy who was a big favorite that kind of stuff and of course it was marvelous and then when I got into Russian things I wouldn't have gotten anything out of Russian things if I hadn't really had this background because I immediately related War and Peace which when I have to do one little piece on how did you get into the Russian field and so forth and

35:48.860 --> 35:50.062
because I did get in very early.

35:50.142 --> 35:51.724
I started taking Russian language very early.

35:52.946 --> 35:55.770
War and Peace I can relate to because I'd read The Forsyth Dog.

35:55.951 --> 36:05.926
I mean, it was, you know, the story, a long story, based on a family and so forth, was the kind of things you read.

36:05.946 --> 36:11.915
Of course, these Dickens novels and so forth, which you had to read some in school.

36:11.935 --> 36:18.124
Usually, you read one Dickens novel in high school, and you hated it so much that you never...

36:18.627 --> 36:27.136
you never read another one and used Dickens as a sort of a... So there's a direct link between the reading in your house and the professional voice you took.

36:27.156 --> 36:28.036
Yeah, absolutely.

36:28.177 --> 36:39.968
I mean, I wouldn't have had the intellectual curiosity, but also I wouldn't have had the sense of standards.

36:39.988 --> 36:44.813
I mean, whether you liked... I mean, he had opinions about books.

36:45.634 --> 36:48.617
He had things that he liked, and

36:49.002 --> 36:58.812
So you were immediately, you got involved in the business of sort of not merely reading, but having an opinion about.

36:58.832 --> 37:06.500
How many volumes do you think approximately the library might have been?

37:07.861 --> 37:14.908
I would guess, it wasn't great, it wasn't large, because the library wasn't that large, but I would guess

37:15.040 --> 37:21.068
He certainly had about a thousand books, something like that, maybe eight hundred thousand books.

37:21.088 --> 37:22.830
But that was basically your core curriculum, wasn't it?

37:22.870 --> 37:24.693
That was my core curriculum, yeah.

37:24.713 --> 37:33.504
And I was, I mean, I can re-imagine visually that entire library.

37:33.645 --> 37:39.192
I mean, that was the physical geography of my early life.

37:39.728 --> 37:41.271
And you'd probably love to have all of them.

37:41.291 --> 37:46.019
I'd love to have them all back, and I'm very sorry that they got disassembled.

37:46.039 --> 37:48.883
They probably went to the Salvation Army, right?

37:48.984 --> 37:50.306
Well, they went to different things.

37:50.406 --> 38:05.672
Mother died early, and then my father remarried, and his second wife wasn't as interested in the books as the first one was, and somehow they just seemed to... Briefly, I was out at Corvus a couple of weeks ago.

38:05.692 --> 38:05.972
Are you...

38:06.762 --> 38:11.748
Can you enlighten me on anything that the Library of Congress will be doing with Corvus and their digitization?

38:11.768 --> 38:12.349
Well, I don't know.

38:12.429 --> 38:14.352
I think we're going to have to probably talk to them.

38:14.912 --> 38:20.940
I'm both interested and a little disturbed by what I read about them.

38:21.060 --> 38:22.723
I haven't talked to them lately.

38:22.743 --> 38:28.390
I talked to the head of their earlier incarnation, Continuum, I think it was called.

38:28.410 --> 38:30.853
Right, it was Continuum.

38:30.873 --> 38:36.280
But, no, I have a certain dialogue going with the...

38:37.289 --> 38:38.690
some of those people out there.

38:38.870 --> 38:40.312
Charles Mazi, I guess.

38:40.332 --> 38:43.354
No, I haven't talked to them lately, and I don't know, maybe you can tell me.

38:43.395 --> 38:49.200
There's an article that I just read in one of these magazines about Corvus.

38:49.240 --> 38:55.365
This was an introductory trip for me until I basically... I'm concerned.

38:55.946 --> 39:06.115
I don't know whether... I mean, I'm concerned because we're trying to... We're devoting a lot of energy to raising philanthropic money so we can

39:06.955 --> 39:12.121
get the contents out free and extend the principle of access to public libraries.

39:12.141 --> 39:18.769
And if they're going to be, and we think that's fine if other people could pick this stuff up and repackage it and use it.

39:19.170 --> 39:23.615
The jacket of my book, the Durer engraving, I got from here.

39:24.156 --> 39:25.237
It cost me $7.50.

39:27.199 --> 39:31.244
The only other copy of that book is at the Morgan, and they wanted something like $500.

39:31.264 --> 39:33.587
So I guess which one I used.

39:33.922 --> 39:36.324
And that's the kind of thing you're talking about.

39:36.344 --> 39:36.905
Well, exactly.

39:37.145 --> 39:41.309
But I think we are trying to make things accessible.

39:41.850 --> 40:01.228
And if other people are trying to make money out of it, it limits the openness and the expansiveness of access to knowledge and adjuncts to creativity, which ought to be as much of it as can be made possible.

40:02.069 --> 40:09.444
I mean, our job as a National Library of the United States is to make as much of it available as cheaply as possible to as many people as possible.

40:09.464 --> 40:10.566
But that's the experience I have.

40:10.586 --> 40:12.971
I'm just magnifying the experience I personally have.

40:13.251 --> 40:16.197
You know, I was lucky enough that my father bought this stuff,

40:16.480 --> 40:19.084
That was a pretty big library for Narbuth, Pennsylvania.

40:19.124 --> 40:21.387
I mean, Narbuth is the... Now, what's the name of the town again?

40:21.467 --> 40:23.390
Narbuth, Pennsylvania.

40:23.410 --> 40:26.855
It's the one unfashionable stop on the... How do you spell it?

40:26.875 --> 40:28.297
N-A-R-B-E-R-T-H.

40:28.438 --> 40:28.998
Okay.

40:29.379 --> 40:31.001
So I don't have to... It's a great town.

40:33.525 --> 40:36.730
But it's just sort of small-town America.

40:36.770 --> 40:39.033
Most of Philadelphia is small-town America.

40:40.656 --> 40:45.643
But the point is that...

40:46.973 --> 40:59.689
Getting access to knowledge is, we think, and John's been very articulate on this as we were getting ready for our bicentennial, that democracy has to be knowledge-based.

40:59.769 --> 41:03.313
It has to be, if you're going to have responsible people, they have to have information.

41:03.353 --> 41:11.884
The principle of Library of Congress is fascinating because the same information that's available to legislators is available to people who elect them.

41:12.745 --> 41:15.208
Now that's a principle that doesn't

41:16.100 --> 41:19.765
apply in most political polities in human history.

41:21.488 --> 41:34.106
So if we're going to have an electronic library, there ought to be things available to everybody as near to free as possible.

41:35.127 --> 41:38.412
And that's what we're trying to do.

41:39.168 --> 41:53.509
Now, if other people are, and we're trying to raise money, so not just for ourselves, we've got this $2 million grant from Ameritech for other research libraries, and none of that will go to us, we're just mediating it out to other libraries to get their stuff digitized, so that they do.

41:53.950 --> 42:05.246
We think it's good for the research libraries, because they establish it, not just Library of Congress, but other major research libraries, are doing something for people who don't use research libraries, for the ordinary schools and libraries around the country.

42:05.266 --> 42:05.867
They're sharing it.

42:06.607 --> 42:08.089
And that's the whole principle.

42:08.109 --> 42:09.570
That's why you have it in your library alone.

42:09.590 --> 42:14.315
That's why you have a kind of cooperative sense of enterprise among libraries.

42:14.335 --> 42:15.857
They're not competitive with each other.

42:15.877 --> 42:19.501
They try to help each other as much as possible.

42:19.521 --> 42:30.673
If the resources of public institutions are going to be taken up by people now, I don't know whether they have, Corbis has exclusive

42:31.312 --> 42:31.893
No, they don't.

42:32.133 --> 42:34.995
But what they have is, you know... They get something, though.

42:35.035 --> 42:36.877
They get some preferential treatment.

42:36.897 --> 42:38.258
We can't give any preferential treatment.

42:38.278 --> 42:38.919
No, you can't.

42:38.959 --> 42:42.122
But what they're saying is, we will have a catalog.

42:42.182 --> 42:43.083
You will be able to get it.

42:43.163 --> 42:44.864
Just the same as Otto Bettman did.

42:45.024 --> 42:52.451
You know, Otto had pictures that were in the public domain, but he had a catalog, and you could order it from him, and they would furnish it at a price.

42:53.352 --> 43:00.458
And these largely are non-exclusive agreements, but what they are doing is, because of the...

43:00.860 --> 43:05.045
the exclusive nature of what they're offering in terms of this catalog.

43:05.185 --> 43:13.395
I mean, this fellow told me he was in France, and somebody said, gee, we'd like to see this certain bacteria.

43:13.655 --> 43:16.018
What's the big bacteria that's been in the news lately?

43:16.038 --> 43:17.140
You think you have a picture of it?

43:17.160 --> 43:17.880
They punched it up.

43:18.581 --> 43:20.143
E. coli bacteria.

43:20.183 --> 43:20.644
There it was.

43:20.684 --> 43:22.546
They had six pictures of it.

43:22.566 --> 43:25.329
So if you wanted something like that immediately, you could buy that.

43:25.770 --> 43:26.631
One time use.

43:26.847 --> 43:29.290
But is the catalog available?

43:29.310 --> 43:30.211
Is that online?

43:30.231 --> 43:31.132
It's online.

43:31.573 --> 43:31.913
I see.

43:32.154 --> 43:33.696
And that's what they're doing.

43:33.956 --> 43:40.224
So what they're doing is offering you at a price something that they can furnish to you immediately.

43:40.705 --> 43:45.150
And, you know, it's a rather ingenious scheme if it works.

43:45.270 --> 43:53.982
I was just wondering, and then just one final question, because you do mention what you see as your mandate of making so many things available.

43:54.763 --> 43:56.685
And I haven't seen this report, but so many people have

43:58.876 --> 44:14.012
I understand there's a GAO report that says that with the funding situation, that one of the options facing the government is to actually close the Library of Congress to public use.

44:14.052 --> 44:14.833
Are you familiar with such a report?

44:14.853 --> 44:15.293
Well, sure.

44:15.374 --> 44:16.274
No, but it isn't quite that.

44:17.015 --> 44:28.107
This is GAO subcontracted this out to Booz Allen Hamilton, and they came up with a report that suggested they weren't asked to do this, but they just gratuitously

44:28.441 --> 44:38.021
suggested presumably to endear themselves to the cutting mentality and get future commissions for other such drastic Draconian studies.

44:38.662 --> 44:44.494
I'm being a little indiscreet there.

44:44.715 --> 44:46.559
If you want to say off the record, say off the record.

44:46.579 --> 44:48.643
Yeah, I put that off the record because I would have

44:48.843 --> 45:11.340
I mean, there was good things in the study too, but they made this gratuitous recommendation that we should cease being a universal collection and that we should be a switchboard that would be able to identify where we should get rid of these expensive collections to maintain and we should just become a

45:11.725 --> 45:13.347
entirely electronic operation.

45:13.367 --> 45:15.790
And a library just for Congress, apparently.

45:15.810 --> 45:27.726
Yeah, and just, well, and so that we can locate, we have full access to where everything is, but we don't actually assume the expense of keeping it up or maintaining the universal collection.

45:27.766 --> 45:33.173
Well, that was... What was your reaction to that?

45:33.253 --> 45:38.661
Well, my reaction was totally negative and confrontational, and we went after tooth and nail.

45:38.781 --> 45:40.483
I gave lengthy testimonies.

45:40.936 --> 45:51.070
We got, and we got, I must say, total support from the Congress, including very eloquent support from Gingrich, who completely rejected the study.

45:51.430 --> 45:57.839
And he gave a very eloquent, explicitly rejected this recommendation.

45:58.140 --> 46:04.328
And then Tom Daschle, who was from the other party in the other house, leader, got up and said, I find myself in the

46:05.050 --> 46:07.615
position of agreeing with everything the speaker just said.

46:07.635 --> 46:09.378
So they've done a public dinner.

46:09.458 --> 46:11.101
Public, large public dinner.

46:11.121 --> 46:12.524
How recent is this?

46:13.305 --> 46:13.786
May 7th.

46:13.806 --> 46:14.207
May 7th.

46:14.227 --> 46:14.647
Yeah.

46:14.667 --> 46:15.609
Did it make any news?

46:15.669 --> 46:16.851
Because I haven't seen it.

46:16.871 --> 46:18.595
Well, I'll provide news.

46:18.615 --> 46:19.917
Yeah, you might be interested.

46:19.977 --> 46:22.722
I heard that from a librarian in the Midwest, basically.

46:23.157 --> 46:28.828
No, we don't get, I mean, the media doesn't cover it.

46:28.888 --> 46:32.575
I mean, if we were in New York, and the New York Times would be writing every other week about it.

46:32.595 --> 46:33.296
I mean, you know.

46:33.336 --> 46:34.258
That's a big story.

46:34.338 --> 46:35.119
It should be the big story.

46:35.139 --> 46:36.502
The fact that it was proposed.

46:36.863 --> 46:36.983
Right.

46:37.003 --> 46:38.986
Just the fact that it was proposed.

46:39.007 --> 46:41.671
Well, the library community was very good on this.

46:41.812 --> 46:45.739
I mean, they really went to bat.

46:46.816 --> 46:57.231
Of course, the great supporters like Mark Hatfield and Claiborne Pell were at the hearing, Pat Moynihan, they were all at the hearing denouncing this study and asking.

46:57.712 --> 47:00.095
This didn't get any exposure.

47:00.175 --> 47:01.697
No, it should have, really.

47:01.958 --> 47:03.660
It's got some, but it's very limited.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.264
But we don't, we get very little exposure.

47:06.284 --> 47:08.487
I read New York Times every day, and I don't remember saying it.

47:09.048 --> 47:14.495
No, if the Messiah were to appear in the main reading room, it wouldn't be covered.

47:14.515 --> 47:14.916
You know?

47:15.655 --> 47:17.897
That's probably a good one to close on, John.

47:17.917 --> 47:22.242
It's just going to help us a little bit with that.

47:22.302 --> 47:24.624
This is really a treat, Dr. Craig.

47:24.644 --> 47:25.425
No, no, no.

47:25.445 --> 47:26.326
It was fun to talk to you.

47:26.346 --> 47:29.309
It's fun to see that somebody's written a book like you have.

47:29.429 --> 47:30.890
I'll really look forward to it.

47:30.991 --> 47:32.492
It's going into its sixth print.

47:32.512 --> 47:34.654
I'll look forward to it.

47:35.155 --> 47:41.241
Again, I didn't even ask you about the problems here, because I think they've been... Yeah, I think we're...

47:41.643 --> 47:42.904
Well, chronicled.

47:43.105 --> 47:48.671
Well, they've been over-chronicled, actually.

47:48.691 --> 48:01.245
But it's a funny thing about books, because there is a certain low-level kleptomania about books.

48:01.265 --> 48:10.215
I mean, people just get a tribute to the book in a way that people can't part with books.

48:10.752 --> 48:12.473
even though they know they borrowed it from somebody.

48:12.514 --> 48:15.256
I'm not talking about the libraries.

48:15.896 --> 48:24.244
I mean, I had a very free, as a teacher, I would lend books quite often to students and so forth, and I was very unsystematic about it.

48:24.364 --> 48:31.010
I lost a lot of books, but somehow I have a kind of sloppy, slobic attitude towards this.

48:31.030 --> 48:36.234
Not as a hopeless librarian of conscience, but in my own approach.

48:36.254 --> 48:40.658
I mean, if somebody wants a book, I just lend it to them and hope it would bring it back.

48:40.823 --> 48:49.294
I told Boyard, loaning a book is like waiting up for your daughter on her first date to come home, waiting for that book to come back.

48:49.314 --> 48:52.698
I don't loan books, I'd rather buy a person a book.

48:52.778 --> 48:58.024
But Herbert Putnam, in 1907, was a librarian, decided to start lending books.

48:58.085 --> 49:08.097
He actually started in 1901, but Congress criticized him about 1905, and he came back and said, well, I would rather take a chance

49:08.397 --> 49:17.627
knowing someone is using a book, not looping that book, then I would have it sitting back on the shelves, and this is its proper attitude for the National Library.

49:18.387 --> 49:21.010
And he responded, and that's what he always did.

49:21.030 --> 49:25.355
And what he didn't say was that we put some books off limits for loan from the beginning.

49:25.415 --> 49:27.797
Rare books, and now genealogy.

49:28.418 --> 49:30.680
We lend to other libraries, basically.

49:30.700 --> 49:36.987
But it's a very American, we have this really basically American attitude of trying to.

49:37.405 --> 49:48.297
One of the interesting things, by shutting the stacks, and the major thing we did, which really has made a difference, was just to shut the stacks, basically.

49:48.317 --> 50:00.370
And what that has meant has meant that, well, those of us like me who love to browse in stacks aren't able to do so anymore.

50:00.410 --> 50:04.695
It does mean that the percentage of books on the shelf for the people in the reading room has gone up.

50:05.165 --> 50:14.498
Because one of the problems of having people with sex is not just theft, but of course misplacement and the Slavic approach to where you put the books.

50:14.819 --> 50:18.364
I don't understand that reference, the Slavic approach?

50:18.424 --> 50:22.530
Don't want to be hard on the slobs, because I've studied all my life.

50:22.550 --> 50:24.953
But then you become soft.

50:24.994 --> 50:26.876
That's a new one, aren't you?

50:26.896 --> 50:27.657
That was so funny.

50:27.717 --> 50:30.902
I remember the great...

50:31.220 --> 50:35.064
a Russian scholar who had been a colleague of mine at Harvard.

50:35.165 --> 50:37.747
And when he retired at Harvard, he had no pension.

50:37.767 --> 50:39.710
And I, at that time, was moving to Princeton.

50:39.730 --> 50:43.154
So I got to Princeton to pick him up.

50:43.234 --> 50:51.683
And so he taught for another 10 years down there toward Florovsky, the greatest Russian theologian philosopher probably in a century.

50:51.703 --> 50:53.085
He was an incredible man.

50:53.626 --> 50:56.148
And a fantastic bibliophile.

50:56.169 --> 50:59.212
Well, he became very dependent on me.

50:59.252 --> 51:00.113
And he was running out of

51:00.464 --> 51:05.393
And the university kept him on with about 70 regular appointments.

51:05.413 --> 51:07.296
And finally, that ran out.

51:07.376 --> 51:09.219
And he said, how am I going to survive?

51:09.320 --> 51:13.126
And I said, well, why don't you sell your books to the library?

51:13.868 --> 51:14.849
So he said, OK.

51:14.889 --> 51:23.805
So what he did was he sold the books, beginning with his worst ones, very scientifically, to the library.

51:23.903 --> 51:30.333
And then he went and took them all out as soon as they were in and kept them out indefinitely.

51:30.353 --> 51:31.515
Oh, that's a funny story.

51:32.115 --> 51:33.417
And then they got mixed up.

51:33.498 --> 51:38.625
So when the books he was selling, he was so sloppy about it, he had all the books piled up.

51:38.665 --> 51:43.292
And so then he began reselling books that he'd already sold.

51:43.373 --> 51:46.858
He would send a whole pack of books.

51:47.058 --> 51:47.419
It is funny.

51:47.459 --> 51:48.340
He couldn't let go.

51:48.480 --> 51:52.026
I mean, he really couldn't.

51:52.406 --> 51:52.847
You do get...

51:53.182 --> 51:54.874
It's a very funny story.

51:54.954 --> 51:57.673
Well, we need to go.
