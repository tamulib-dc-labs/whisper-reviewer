WEBVTT

00:02.191 --> 00:07.076
So you would cut and allow that to bleed.

00:08.077 --> 00:12.902
And... This is a 13th century... Yeah.

00:12.922 --> 00:14.523
But this went back to the 6th century.

00:14.623 --> 00:16.425
Yeah, they were doing this a whole lot.

00:16.565 --> 00:20.349
So the reason this gets into your collection is it does have some medical application.

00:20.389 --> 00:21.610
Right, yes.

00:21.630 --> 00:28.637
And they vary the spot depending on the zodiac.

00:29.022 --> 00:32.205
You figure out the sign of the Ziviak.

00:33.387 --> 00:33.647
Yes.

00:34.768 --> 00:36.009
You figure out the month.

00:36.029 --> 00:36.690
700 years old.

00:37.351 --> 00:43.177
And then you, and somebody then went through some things.

00:44.999 --> 00:49.063
I'll show you what else this was good for.

00:49.083 --> 00:53.948
These are some additional books that were bound with this kind of thing.

00:53.988 --> 00:56.751
This is just normal decoration.

00:57.423 --> 01:02.771
But somebody uses this, I guess, for a Christmas card or something.

01:03.552 --> 01:14.086
And this one wasn't unique in that it had the anatomy there.

01:14.267 --> 01:17.171
It is not common, but it's not rare.

01:17.431 --> 01:20.195
In other words, this is not unusual.

01:21.377 --> 01:27.345
And let me show you one more thing that goes back to the year of Columbus.

01:28.777 --> 01:30.339
It's quite a collection, Doctor.

01:31.480 --> 01:40.430
Well, here are the people you know of origin of species Darwin.

01:41.051 --> 01:41.972
That's the first origin?

01:42.652 --> 01:44.555
Yeah.

01:44.575 --> 01:50.201
This is the first origin which Darwin presented to his nephew, Godfrey Welchwood.

01:51.482 --> 01:58.530
And it is this letter from Darwin to my dear Godfrey, which he discusses.

01:59.168 --> 02:01.951
It's a presentation copy from Charles Darwin.

02:02.131 --> 02:11.821
But Darwin never inscribed these copies, but in this case, his letter was put in, and there's Garfield Waitsward.

02:11.841 --> 02:15.485
His wife's family were Waitsward.

02:15.525 --> 02:16.466
She was a Waitsward.

02:16.566 --> 02:17.167
Right.

02:17.187 --> 02:21.331
What else?

02:21.351 --> 02:26.577
That's quiteâ€”that's what's known as a smallpox.

02:27.957 --> 02:29.739
This is quite a library, Doctor.

02:29.759 --> 02:34.525
This is a medical book.

02:35.326 --> 02:36.627
This is a second edition.

02:49.803 --> 02:57.272
This was about something like fifteen or fourteen

02:57.995 --> 02:59.116
Oh, 1390.

03:00.098 --> 03:01.700
So, 100 years before the discovery?

03:02.040 --> 03:02.140
Yeah.

03:02.160 --> 03:06.466
No, I don't know.

03:06.486 --> 03:07.727
This was 1492.

03:07.807 --> 03:09.109
I'm sorry.

03:09.810 --> 03:12.293
Oh, this was the year, roughly.

03:12.313 --> 03:14.035
This is the doctor.

03:15.017 --> 03:17.039
They would bring down urine if you examine it.

03:17.960 --> 03:23.327
And these were colored, and you'd make the diagnosis by the color of the urine.

03:24.353 --> 03:32.821
Was that, was that pretty, was it sophisticated, or was it, again, pretty, uh... Well, you really told you what's going on.

03:32.841 --> 03:35.964
But they knew that it was different and perhaps an indicator.

03:35.984 --> 03:38.146
They didn't have the chemistry that we had, but... Yeah.

03:39.087 --> 03:40.408
They tried, didn't they, huh?

03:41.329 --> 03:43.731
Really, a rivalry of that time.

03:44.572 --> 03:45.873
Here's whoever he is.

03:46.033 --> 03:46.934
He was a lecturer.

03:48.335 --> 03:53.280
Here are all the books that anyone could have had in medicine.

03:54.475 --> 04:03.668
And this is a second edition which is excessively rare.

04:04.329 --> 04:09.216
And among other things, it was printed in color.

04:09.737 --> 04:10.238
Really?

04:12.361 --> 04:13.723
Well, that must have been hand-tipped.

04:13.743 --> 04:15.505
It couldn't have been printed in color.

04:15.525 --> 04:18.489
It's all off in the same direction.

04:18.509 --> 04:20.713
Look at it.

04:20.733 --> 04:21.073
This comes off.

04:21.442 --> 04:23.265
Every color is often the same.

04:23.285 --> 04:28.473
You know, this, it says, this is the third color.

04:28.493 --> 04:31.798
And all of the books, all of this edition has that.

04:31.818 --> 04:34.081
And there's the, is it allogenical?

04:35.243 --> 04:35.984
Close to it.

04:36.004 --> 04:36.805
Close to it.

04:36.825 --> 04:40.130
Which would indicate that it's printed now.

04:40.150 --> 04:41.372
And this is an anatomy book.

04:41.512 --> 04:43.515
So here's a deception.

04:43.535 --> 04:47.201
Who this is, I don't know, but he's pointing, you see, at this point of the knife.

04:47.221 --> 04:47.982
Oh, my God.

04:48.002 --> 04:50.065
He is doing the cutting.

04:50.568 --> 04:55.837
Dissection's in public again, but you see they're talking and they're arguing.

04:57.259 --> 04:58.642
What is the title of this book, Doctor?

04:58.702 --> 04:59.944
It's called Mundinus.

05:02.648 --> 05:04.331
M-U-N-D-I-N-U-S.

05:04.351 --> 05:08.077
I just want to write it down, but I'd like to check it out a little bit, too.

05:08.097 --> 05:08.718
Mundinus.

05:08.738 --> 05:09.299
Mundinus.

05:10.562 --> 05:13.967
How do you spell it?

05:15.229 --> 05:16.812
M-U-N-D-I-N-U-S.

05:17.973 --> 05:32.207
And here's the first edition of that same book.

05:32.247 --> 05:32.968
Oh, wait a minute.

05:34.349 --> 05:35.530
Let me do this.

05:35.791 --> 05:36.832
Can I do this, please?

05:37.553 --> 05:40.035
You can't do it without getting up here.

05:41.256 --> 05:47.102
All right.

05:49.529 --> 06:12.124
And this is, again, a rare bird.

06:12.144 --> 06:12.805
Look at this one.

06:12.845 --> 06:17.612
Oh, my goodness.

06:21.777 --> 06:29.424
And it's by color again, right?

06:33.368 --> 06:35.991
Here's where you cut the phlebotomy.

06:38.173 --> 06:42.817
That's the best thing that there is, for anything.

06:42.837 --> 06:46.941
There are diseases.

06:46.961 --> 06:48.583
Is that the astrology?

06:48.603 --> 06:50.805
The astrology figure, yeah.

06:51.562 --> 06:54.627
Here's the disease of the woman.

06:54.887 --> 06:57.932
There's pregnancy, little baby's got it.

06:58.573 --> 07:03.280
Her heart, your heart isn't back there.

07:03.560 --> 07:05.163
There's not quite a vacuum.

07:05.183 --> 07:06.505
Oh, it's kind of like this.

07:07.126 --> 07:09.009
This is real, real.

07:09.109 --> 07:10.771
Seat of the past, so to speak.

07:10.791 --> 07:11.052
Right.

07:12.634 --> 07:17.822
So this is the first edition of that, which is...

07:20.620 --> 07:25.745
And these were printed in Venice.

07:25.765 --> 07:27.186
And this was 1491.

07:27.206 --> 07:31.470
And the other was 1492.

07:31.490 --> 07:32.932
But they reset the type entirely.

07:33.212 --> 07:34.433
Yeah.

07:36.075 --> 07:38.957
Well, as I say, I can keep going.

07:41.159 --> 07:43.642
You need to show us a couple of these, perhaps.

07:43.702 --> 07:45.243
I'll be happy to put those back up.

07:46.985 --> 07:47.185
All right.

07:47.452 --> 07:50.716
Maybe I should go up in it.

07:54.620 --> 07:57.083
You're a big guy.

07:57.183 --> 07:59.666
I'm a big guy.

07:59.686 --> 08:00.667
I want to break the chair.

08:02.329 --> 08:04.831
Doctor, do you think it goes in?

08:04.991 --> 08:06.413
No, it's the spine's out.

08:06.894 --> 08:10.698
The outs will be leaning over and it won't fit.

08:10.718 --> 08:14.882
That's how you straighten it out and the other hooks can go beside it.

08:14.902 --> 08:16.564
It goes in the corner?

08:16.704 --> 08:17.205
Yeah.

08:17.911 --> 08:23.096
I don't know how many titles altogether would you say in the collection review?

08:28.281 --> 08:29.762
Have you cataloged it at all?

08:29.782 --> 08:30.783
Yeah.

08:33.145 --> 08:33.786
Humble, too.

08:33.806 --> 08:34.367
You're humble.

08:34.527 --> 08:45.437
Well, this is a... Thanks, man.

08:46.463 --> 08:46.964
Thank you.

08:53.893 --> 08:54.133
My pleasure.

08:54.153 --> 08:55.395
Are you still practicing, Doctor?

08:55.796 --> 09:05.829
No, I just stopped getting my lecture in the Ministry of Medicine because I figured I was forgetting the important thing, so I quit.

09:06.170 --> 09:08.132
The books must have helped you, though, in those courses.

09:08.192 --> 09:11.096
Our last session was always here.

09:11.837 --> 09:12.138
Really?

09:12.158 --> 09:13.780
I thought that was your favorite.

09:13.800 --> 09:15.222
And I refused to have more than that.

09:15.843 --> 09:17.485
I preferred twelve students.

09:17.565 --> 09:19.968
Occasionally they got one or two more.

09:19.988 --> 09:23.191
Were these first-year students, fourth-year students generally?

09:23.412 --> 09:29.839
Well, I had a seminar of first-year students in the university, USC.

09:30.360 --> 09:31.701
These were not medical students.

09:31.721 --> 09:34.965
They just came in at the beginning, first course.

09:36.247 --> 09:45.377
I had a summer school group of minority students and a seminar for the third-year medical students.

09:46.066 --> 09:48.349
I wonder how many collectors you started amongst those.

09:48.369 --> 09:50.952
Well, I think I could have my lead here now.

09:52.013 --> 09:54.456
So the final class would be here.

09:55.297 --> 09:55.818
Yes.

09:55.938 --> 09:59.502
And tell me what this final class was like.

09:59.543 --> 10:00.824
What books they were interested in.

10:02.626 --> 10:10.716
But everything you had taught them in the semester pointed towards this culminating... Well, I had all the books that they talked about.

10:11.777 --> 10:15.322
And this one was written by a doctor.

10:15.342 --> 10:15.482
Mm-hmm.

10:15.935 --> 10:19.339
And, uh, so it isn't really a medical book.

10:20.521 --> 10:23.805
But somehow, to me, this involves... Well, it's certainly relevant.

10:24.486 --> 10:25.227
Oh, look at that.

10:27.029 --> 10:32.957
And Copernicus... Oh, he gave the battle.

10:32.977 --> 10:34.279
This is the first Copernicus?

10:34.499 --> 10:37.583
Yeah.

10:37.603 --> 10:40.948
Oh, my goodness.

10:40.968 --> 10:43.631
Now I'm getting a little... Now I'm getting very excited.

10:43.651 --> 10:44.372
Nicolae...

10:44.808 --> 10:46.310
It's called Pernica.

10:46.811 --> 10:47.912
Let us know if we break it up.

10:48.173 --> 10:49.134
It's a Pernica sliver.

10:49.174 --> 10:54.822
And then somebody would check up on him, you see?

10:55.362 --> 10:56.364
The guy who owned this.

10:58.226 --> 11:02.792
We know that this belonged to Bishop Juan of Osmo.

11:02.812 --> 11:04.134
Because this is his binding.

11:05.256 --> 11:06.277
He was contemporary.

11:07.258 --> 11:12.165
And there were lots of notes that they think were his writings.

11:12.955 --> 11:16.058
so that he checked Matt.

11:16.079 --> 11:19.522
In fact, there's one place Copernicus made and he's taken the dishes.

11:20.103 --> 11:25.329
So you made these little compromises.

11:25.429 --> 11:30.295
Well, it's not medicine, but... This is where the book lover takes over, I think.

11:30.335 --> 11:32.597
Maybe.

11:32.617 --> 11:33.618
And what's the year on that now?

11:33.638 --> 11:41.427
That's the Feen 40 MDX LII 383.

11:43.060 --> 11:44.201
Same years.

11:45.162 --> 11:45.842
Very similar.

11:46.903 --> 11:48.425
What I was saying is good people.

11:48.445 --> 11:50.526
What a year when you come down to it.

11:50.546 --> 11:51.107
Interesting.

11:53.569 --> 12:07.300
Just into sum, if you have any thoughts on why book collecting seems to be particularly popular among... Doctors start every paper by giving history.

12:07.320 --> 12:12.865
Every scientific paper that you'll ever see in any journal starts with the history of the subject.

12:14.549 --> 12:20.456
quotes the people who were important early on, and then with the changes.

12:22.798 --> 12:30.727
Doctors always have thought of their art and science as being part of the history.

12:30.747 --> 12:38.216
And I think that that's why doctors continue to use, think of history, think of how it started.

12:38.236 --> 12:43.982
And it's part of being... And then it's only a natural progression to want to have the artifacts...

12:44.317 --> 12:45.879
to document it and to feel it.

12:46.579 --> 12:47.200
That's brilliant.

12:47.921 --> 12:50.404
I think that was my wife's question, by the way.

12:50.684 --> 12:55.569
Well, Nick has brought up many times during his research that there's so many... So many doctors.

12:55.609 --> 13:06.181
Well, I think that's... Really, I don't know of any other field where this is the custom and there's always been the history.

13:08.123 --> 13:08.863
This makes me nervous.

13:08.883 --> 13:13.108
Doctor, can I close this up and have Nick put this away from you?

13:14.557 --> 13:21.910
I bet you know exactly where everyone is.

13:22.772 --> 13:24.034
Every once in a while, forget.

13:24.054 --> 13:28.803
I couldn't find that damn Darwin that's in there.

13:29.424 --> 13:30.967
It was on this shelf.

13:31.207 --> 13:31.968
Did you get nervous?

13:32.830 --> 13:34.233
Well, I knew that I had it.

13:35.635 --> 13:36.717
I didn't know where it was.

13:36.737 --> 13:38.961
Doctor, I have to say, my husband does collect books and

13:39.160 --> 13:40.442
It'll drive him crazy.

13:40.462 --> 13:43.547
He won't remember where something is, but he'll dream.

13:43.807 --> 13:47.593
I'll wake up at 5.30 in the morning and say, that's where it is.

13:48.174 --> 13:49.115
He'll say, you touched it.

13:49.135 --> 13:51.158
You put it in the area.

13:51.178 --> 13:54.763
This is the first herbal printer by Peter Schaeffer.

13:54.783 --> 13:55.625
Oh, Peter Schaeffer.

13:57.447 --> 14:00.192
Well, you know, he's a colleague of Gutenberg.

14:01.574 --> 14:04.218
This is the Gutenberg press that belonged to Fusten.

14:04.258 --> 14:07.783
Well, can we have to take a look at this?

14:08.303 --> 14:12.948
This is... Now you're going to the... Oh!

14:12.968 --> 14:14.530
This is a Major League collection, Doctor.

14:14.550 --> 14:15.211
You know that, huh?

14:15.731 --> 14:16.112
I think.

14:17.713 --> 14:18.474
Oh, boy.

14:18.494 --> 14:19.916
That is type, huh?

14:20.136 --> 14:23.019
Is that manuscript on the... This is manuscript.

14:23.059 --> 14:24.060
That looks like manuscript.

14:24.080 --> 14:24.321
Right.

14:24.381 --> 14:25.882
That's just used for the binding.

14:25.902 --> 14:26.283
Okay.

14:26.904 --> 14:28.245
This is called prison.

14:29.086 --> 14:30.788
Is this paper or vellum?

14:30.868 --> 14:36.094
It's a pretty good rag, though, isn't it?

14:36.114 --> 14:37.315
Does it have its cauliflower on it?

14:43.218 --> 14:48.363
Well, this is not it?

14:48.623 --> 14:55.230
No, but that's... Well, this would not be Goodenberg.

14:55.270 --> 15:01.676
No, it would be... In fact, I don't think Goodenberg ever had a column.

15:01.696 --> 15:03.098
Does it have a title?

15:05.981 --> 15:09.704
You know, he didn't really go into it.

15:09.724 --> 15:12.347
And, uh... You know, roughly when it was...

15:12.597 --> 15:13.298
1548.

15:13.538 --> 15:18.204
There it is.

15:18.224 --> 15:21.168
1548.

15:21.188 --> 15:23.891
1548, that's... Yeah.

15:23.912 --> 15:24.993
It's still working, yeah.

15:29.939 --> 15:30.580
Isn't it beautiful?

15:30.600 --> 15:33.984
And, of course, the world medicine thing.

15:34.004 --> 15:34.665
That was medicine.

15:36.167 --> 15:38.150
Is the finding contemporary, do you think?

15:38.170 --> 15:39.111
They think so.

15:44.626 --> 15:48.111
Well, pretty remarkably, as a matter of fact.

15:48.291 --> 15:53.038
Those picks were pretty well done.

15:53.078 --> 15:57.204
They were rebound within a hundred years or so, after.

15:57.224 --> 15:58.866
Well, because they were used.

15:59.767 --> 16:00.769
Well, they were used.

16:00.789 --> 16:01.670
But they were marvelous conditionals.

16:04.093 --> 16:11.744
If you also saw some of the Huntington in those cases that had the original blending.

16:12.205 --> 16:12.405
Beautiful.

16:12.554 --> 16:15.541
All the questions are very conspiring.

16:15.841 --> 16:17.064
Are you doing research out there?

16:18.387 --> 16:19.449
Occasionally.

16:19.489 --> 16:24.621
Today I am on the committee there, and they're having problems.

16:24.941 --> 16:25.703
That's a secret.
