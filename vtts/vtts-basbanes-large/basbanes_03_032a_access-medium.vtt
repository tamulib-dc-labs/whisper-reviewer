WEBVTT

00:02.697 --> 00:06.222
We are recording and we're talking with Chip Kidd.

00:06.242 --> 00:09.206
And there are just so many different ways to start this, I guess.

00:09.266 --> 00:15.815
But I guess I love the fact that you treat the book.

00:17.057 --> 00:30.215
I have to say, reading your book and interviews with you, and also drawing from my own experience down at Yale, talking to people who design books down there, do you actually read the books that you design?

00:30.395 --> 00:31.557
Well, I...

00:32.026 --> 00:44.183
In my experience, a good many of the book designers that I know, the book jacket designers, I guess is more accurate to say, I think that's more the norm than not.

00:45.185 --> 00:49.992
Now, there's not always an option.

00:53.116 --> 00:59.485
You know, often a jacket is needed before there's a finished manuscript or even a finished first draft.

01:00.055 --> 01:09.289
Sometimes you only get a part of it to read, but yeah, ideally you need to read the books first before you start.

01:09.309 --> 01:16.701
Do you approach a novel differently than you, say, might deal with the work of nonfiction?

01:17.562 --> 01:20.146
It all depends.

01:22.650 --> 01:28.459
I don't think about it that way as much as I think about what actually is the book

01:29.300 --> 01:32.043
what is the book?

01:32.123 --> 01:32.924
What's it about?

01:33.365 --> 01:36.168
How is the author approaching the subject matter?

01:37.249 --> 01:48.262
There's a book a while back by Robert Pulido on the life of Jim Thompson, the author.

01:49.844 --> 01:59.155
The impulse when you're doing a biography is to find an interesting picture of the subject and

01:59.962 --> 02:29.158
do a type treatment and that and so for that but you know Jim Thompson was you know this took pulp crime writing and kind of elevated it to an art form or at least that was the one of the angles of the book so I made the cover I sort of basically deconstructed and then reconstructed some pop some um

02:29.746 --> 02:31.788
pulp covers up his books.

02:32.969 --> 02:43.280
So that sort of, that was a way of approaching it in a different way, because I thought that that was appropriate for him.

02:44.161 --> 02:51.609
So, you know, it's really kind of one, you just take it one case at a time.

02:51.769 --> 02:55.313
All books are different, you know.

02:56.374 --> 02:58.977
Sometimes it might be interesting to

02:59.969 --> 03:06.585
uh, you know, take a novel, um, and not make it look like a work of fiction.

03:08.309 --> 03:16.830
Uh, and of course that's, that's a kind of, you know, general, over-generalized statement, but, um,

03:17.283 --> 03:23.909
There are many different ways to do that, but sometimes that would seem to make sense.

03:23.969 --> 03:28.914
Do you try to challenge the reader, or do you really want the perspective?

03:29.214 --> 03:30.976
What is a successful jacket for you?

03:30.996 --> 03:37.602
If someone goes to a bookstore and picks up the book, you've already succeeded in what you're supposed to do.

03:37.802 --> 03:40.164
Yeah, you've just totally summed it up.

03:40.184 --> 03:40.725
That's that.

03:40.965 --> 03:41.585
That's your job.

03:41.705 --> 03:44.488
That's my job.

03:45.312 --> 03:52.948
As I've said many, many times before, I'm a great believer in that book jackets don't sell books.

03:54.250 --> 03:56.655
Bookstores sell books.

03:57.457 --> 04:05.734
But what a really good book jacket will do is kind of capture your attention amidst the sea of...

04:07.267 --> 04:28.245
its surroundings in a bookstore and there's many many different factors to uh why books sell or don't sell um but you know i'm i'm glad that it's uh it's still a relatively mysterious

04:28.900 --> 04:33.467
that you just can't, you know, you just can't.

04:33.487 --> 04:34.990
There's no formula, really.

04:35.671 --> 04:48.571
You know, you've contributed to this, certainly, but there was a time quite a while, not so long ago, really, when people would buy books, and one of the first things they did was remove the dust jackets and throw them away.

04:49.192 --> 04:50.354
Yeah, like a candy bar.

04:50.474 --> 04:51.376
Like a candy bar.

04:51.556 --> 04:53.980
And, of course, if you look at values of books today,

04:54.314 --> 05:06.988
in the marketplace, you know, first Gatsby, for instance, you know, what the jacket might be worth, pick a number, and without the jacket is maybe 10% of that.

05:07.088 --> 05:17.219
And you can't even, more recently, you know, modern first, you can't even hope to market a book that doesn't have the jacket with it.

05:17.239 --> 05:21.283
So the jacket really has become, is regarded as an integral

05:21.719 --> 05:25.589
element of the book, the materiality of the book.

05:26.031 --> 05:30.462
There was a wonderful study published a couple years ago called Paratexts.

05:30.482 --> 05:31.305
Are you familiar with that?

05:31.625 --> 05:31.866
No.

05:32.087 --> 05:34.834
A French scholar by the name of Jeunet

05:35.489 --> 05:42.079
And he talks about the various physical elements that go into the making of a book and a distinguishing book.

05:42.159 --> 05:53.016
And he talks about dust jackets, he talks about type, he talks about design, he talks about how the appendices and all of the physical aspects that make a book a book.

05:53.157 --> 05:55.320
And I would say clearly Tom Hodes.

05:55.300 --> 05:58.451
among these today are the jacket.

05:59.756 --> 06:05.054
And I'm sure that you would heartily agree with that assessment.

06:05.074 --> 06:06.660
Yeah, certainly.

06:07.282 --> 06:15.030
Type, of course, factors into what works into the equation with you, I assume.

06:15.231 --> 06:17.854
Of course, selection of type.

06:17.894 --> 06:19.896
You also have a Penn State background.

06:20.176 --> 06:21.678
I do, yeah.

06:22.439 --> 06:33.731
I majored in graphic design at Penn State, and I wrote a novel called The Cheese Monkeys, and that's what that's about.

06:33.751 --> 06:35.753
I was amused to see

06:36.121 --> 06:40.488
So you describe Penn State as the 13th grade in Pennsylvania?

06:41.009 --> 06:41.109
Yeah.

06:41.129 --> 06:45.376
I went to Penn State graduate school 40 years ago this fall.

06:45.617 --> 06:46.438
Oh, my God.

06:46.578 --> 06:51.767
It was because I was graduating from a school up in Maine Beach College.

06:52.186 --> 06:55.831
And I was being drafted out into Vietnam.

06:56.391 --> 07:02.179
And I had just been waitlisted at Columbia for their journalism school.

07:02.239 --> 07:04.502
Everybody in the world was trying to stay out of the military.

07:04.602 --> 07:07.285
So that's how I got to Penn State.

07:07.305 --> 07:07.806
Wow.

07:07.986 --> 07:09.368
And for journalism?

07:09.408 --> 07:10.269
Journalism, yeah.

07:10.289 --> 07:13.954
I was there for a year, and then I got a fellowship in Washington, D.C.

07:14.334 --> 07:15.736
And then ultimately, they got me.

07:15.836 --> 07:17.518
I had to go in the Navy.

07:18.106 --> 07:20.650
Anyway, I enjoyed Penn State.

07:20.850 --> 07:22.052
I did too.

07:22.252 --> 07:32.708
I mean, first of all, I would think in most states, the state university of the 13th grade, it's certainly not something that's unique to Pennsylvania.

07:33.308 --> 07:44.265
But as I look back, it's actually kind of appalling how little thought I wanted to put into where I went to college.

07:44.305 --> 07:47.910
And I knew I had to go.

07:48.177 --> 07:55.255
And I wanted to go, but I was so wrapped up in high school that I didn't want to research schools.

07:55.315 --> 08:05.140
I didn't want to be bothered with visiting other places, and Penn State seemed fine.

08:05.542 --> 08:06.543
And that was that.

08:06.603 --> 08:08.666
It certainly hasn't hurt you in a long way.

08:08.786 --> 08:10.649
No, no, not at all.

08:10.669 --> 08:16.116
I like reading where your great goal in life was to be Chris Partridge on the Partridge family.

08:16.536 --> 08:21.382
So did you really have any clue as to what you were looking for in life early on?

08:21.402 --> 08:28.091
I mean, you got to New York, you got yourself a job, a great job, within a month, which you've had now for 20 odd years.

08:28.732 --> 08:28.832
Yeah.

08:29.150 --> 08:37.624
I mean, explain to me how the dust jacket became such a prominent aspect of your life.

08:37.644 --> 08:39.247
Yeah, I mean, it's odd.

08:39.708 --> 08:43.494
You know, did things work out, quote, the way I thought they were going to?

08:43.735 --> 08:44.015
No.

08:44.236 --> 08:45.718
Did they work out really well?

08:45.778 --> 08:46.179
Yes.

08:46.640 --> 08:52.710
So, I mean, I knew...

08:52.994 --> 08:57.421
you know, by high school, that I wanted to do something creative.

08:57.621 --> 09:05.594
But beyond that, I didn't really have strong opinions or thoughts about what exactly that could be.

09:05.634 --> 09:15.049
I mean, I was, I mean, all kidding aside with the Chris Partridge thing, I was very into music and playing the drums.

09:15.610 --> 09:19.356
But I didn't, the pragmatist in me didn't see...

09:19.758 --> 09:23.602
a clear path to happily doing that for a living.

09:26.666 --> 09:39.100
I don't think I was professional symphony orchestra material, plus that kind of music was interesting, but not that interesting to me, especially if you're playing the drums.

09:39.641 --> 09:44.626
Watch the percussion section of any symphony you go to.

09:44.726 --> 09:48.010
They're usually not doing much of anything.

09:48.547 --> 09:49.749
May I interrupt?

09:49.769 --> 10:01.224
I was at the Boston Symphony a couple years ago with my wife, and I was talking to a gentleman nearby, and I was openly admiring the work of what I said to the drummer, and he said, you mean the timpanis?

10:01.244 --> 10:01.885
Right, yeah.

10:02.185 --> 10:06.651
That would be... Well, that was the other thing.

10:06.691 --> 10:10.216
You know, I was good at a lot of stuff, but not the timpani.

10:10.236 --> 10:16.444
And I guess that's my coda to this, so to speak, is that, you know,

10:16.576 --> 10:22.765
The drummer in a symphony orchestra is the timpanist, basically.

10:23.686 --> 10:30.035
But I didn't know notes, and I couldn't tune anything, and that's what it is constantly.

10:31.277 --> 10:40.390
So you became attracted to the book with a capital B, and maybe you could talk to me a little bit about your own feelings about the book as artifacts.

10:40.943 --> 10:47.840
And just as a conversational way of... Well, you know, I don't know.

10:47.900 --> 10:50.706
Let's see, what can I say about it that hasn't really been said?

10:50.726 --> 10:59.307
I mean, I think certainly in the past couple of years I've been asked if I think that

10:59.793 --> 11:02.898
books are going to go the way of LPs.

11:02.938 --> 11:08.286
Yeah, and I think that's the stupidest question in the world myself, too, so that's why you won't hear me asking it.

11:08.366 --> 11:09.888
No, you can't.

11:10.008 --> 11:10.910
You certainly can't.

11:11.010 --> 11:22.948
I mean, and my opinion, of course, is no, and there's all different kinds of ways to talk about this, but, you know, when you think about it,

11:24.413 --> 11:40.638
You know, the LP and then the CD are really rather strange 20th century phenomena in that it made music into a thing.

11:41.800 --> 11:46.928
It made it into a physical object, which it never had been before.

11:47.313 --> 11:49.175
That's nice, by the way.

11:49.255 --> 11:49.936
I like that.

11:49.956 --> 11:50.297
Thank you.

11:50.337 --> 11:50.857
That's good.

11:51.138 --> 11:51.378
All right.

11:51.418 --> 11:52.820
Well, let's put it in.

11:52.840 --> 11:53.681
That's neat to me.

11:53.701 --> 11:53.921
Go ahead.

11:54.342 --> 11:58.547
Whereas books have always been physical objects.

11:58.567 --> 12:05.615
So, you know, before you could record something, if you went to see a Beethoven symphony or something, I mean, that was it.

12:05.916 --> 12:11.803
You know, you went and you listened to it and that's how you perceived it.

12:11.843 --> 12:15.447
That's how you, you know, you kept it in your memory or what have you.

12:15.567 --> 12:16.088
And then

12:16.608 --> 12:35.754
when recording devices came along, you know, you would put it on an Edison roll, or you'd put it on a 78, or, you know, etc., etc., until it became a CD, and now it's back to what it was before, which is just pure sound.

12:38.358 --> 12:44.066
But books, you know, starting with scrolls, were always physical objects.

12:44.086 --> 12:44.927
They were always

12:45.262 --> 12:50.326
things that you had and held and stored and kept.

12:52.408 --> 12:57.613
They are, I think, one of the perfect interactive devices.

12:59.174 --> 13:14.948
And I think all this talk about digitizing books and making every book available online and all that, I mean, obviously that is happening and will happen, but it's not going to...

13:15.299 --> 13:19.028
It's not going to replace people buying and reading books.

13:19.409 --> 13:33.301
Well, I think the closest I will ever come, because I've written five books about books, but the closest I'll ever come to writing a love scene in a book is where I describe the tactility of actually stroking a book.

13:33.882 --> 13:34.303
Sure.

13:34.283 --> 13:36.146
All of the senses are involved.

13:36.186 --> 13:40.594
If it's beautiful, I mean, you open an old book, you smell it.

13:40.674 --> 13:41.676
It's intoxicating.

13:42.718 --> 13:46.284
If the binding is developed, you stroke it.

13:46.324 --> 13:50.892
At what point do you lick it, though?

13:51.813 --> 13:53.015
There are people that do.

13:53.136 --> 13:55.680
I mean, I sort of draw the line there.

13:56.582 --> 13:57.323
That's good.

13:57.343 --> 13:58.044
You made me laugh.

13:58.124 --> 13:58.525
Thank you.

13:58.986 --> 13:59.667
That's good.

13:59.647 --> 14:04.261
But there is a tactile relationship, I think, with the book.

14:04.281 --> 14:08.453
And it is interesting that you design hardcover books.

14:08.513 --> 14:10.800
I mean, you don't really even do the paperbacks.

14:10.820 --> 14:13.588
I do some paperbacks.

14:14.176 --> 14:19.124
But they're certainly very much in the minority of the stuff that I've done.

14:20.847 --> 14:24.273
But that reflects a commitment to the high end of the book.

14:24.373 --> 14:28.920
I mean, as also, not only as an object, but as an enduring object.

14:30.002 --> 14:36.032
You talk about tattoos, which amuses me too, because I've actually written about tattoos.

14:36.012 --> 14:39.739
tattoos on human skin as an ephemeral lighting surface.

14:40.119 --> 14:56.608
I mean, when the person dies, the writing, you know, whatever the tattoo is, it kind of goes away with the decedent unless somebody strips the... I've actually written about, you know, lighting surfaces, which is why the paper kind of emerges from that.

14:56.989 --> 15:01.176
But when you do a book, I mean, as you point out, the book is a...

15:01.612 --> 15:04.335
a commitment to something that's going to be around for a while.

15:04.696 --> 15:07.999
I mean, it's going to outlive all of us.

15:08.780 --> 15:13.526
And you also point out the financial commitment to a book also becomes an emotional one.

15:13.606 --> 15:15.628
I think it's part and parcel of the same thing.

15:17.871 --> 15:26.140
It just kind of, again, brings us back to the artifact because a book is more than just a carrier of information.

15:26.220 --> 15:30.285
It has an artifactual value to it.

15:30.839 --> 15:31.360
I guess.

15:31.901 --> 15:44.041
And of course the work that you do as designer and book jacket artist is all part of that particular package, I guess.

15:44.542 --> 15:46.746
Yeah, definitely.

15:47.026 --> 15:48.729
You know, I find it awkward on the phone.

15:48.749 --> 15:49.430
I hope you don't mind.

15:49.491 --> 15:56.863
I usually prefer to do these, like yourself, I'm very visual and I'm really

15:57.316 --> 16:07.730
You get your ideas from what you see also, not just from what you see, so you'll have to forgive me for jumping around the block on the interview here.

16:08.151 --> 16:17.504
I do want to talk a little bit about your own collecting of stuff and things, and Professor McClatchy calls your apartment the Batcave, which I think is kind of cool.

16:18.265 --> 16:22.851
And if you could talk to me a little bit about your own collecting of stuff and of things.

16:24.013 --> 16:27.137
Well, sure.

16:28.062 --> 16:30.444
God, there's so many different ways to talk about it.

16:30.464 --> 16:53.964
I mean, first of all, having a modest-sized one-bedroom apartment in New York does sort of cramp one's style a little bit when you're a collector because, you know, true collectors, which I think I am one of, are always on the hunt for stuff.

16:55.045 --> 16:57.647
And it's...

16:57.948 --> 17:24.681
it's kind of reached critical mass a bit but but you know my the first real book i did as author and designer and art director and body blah was this book that being collected in 1996 and it was about my sort of lifelong passion for collecting batman stuff um even unwittingly as a child or wittingly but not you know

17:25.150 --> 17:30.175
you're not collecting it then for the same reasons I think that you do later.

17:30.395 --> 17:33.618
Well, there's an intellectual element that it is after a point, I think, too.

17:33.858 --> 17:34.339
Yeah.

17:34.359 --> 17:35.420
That you don't have as a kid.

17:36.361 --> 17:37.062
Well, maybe not.

17:37.902 --> 17:38.183
Right.

17:38.203 --> 17:39.784
I don't know.

17:39.804 --> 17:40.245
Go ahead.

17:40.265 --> 17:40.865
I'm sorry.

17:40.885 --> 17:41.426
No, that's all right.

17:42.687 --> 17:53.858
But, I mean, the curious thing about Batman is that, you know, even though now it's in the last 20 years, um,

17:54.462 --> 17:59.348
for 15 years, become more of a movie phenomenon and all of that.

17:59.388 --> 18:04.614
I mean, the roots really are in the comic books, which are, of course, still published to this day.

18:07.217 --> 18:17.550
So there's the whole issue of collecting comics, which I sort of do, but I don't do that the way I collect everything else, which is

18:18.661 --> 18:24.008
as objects, which is the toys, the artwork.

18:25.630 --> 18:48.077
The problem with, like, quote-unquote serious comic, the people that collect the stuff from the 40s, 30s and 40s, which is known as the golden age, and it's become outrageously, and, you know, they're so fragile, and they weren't,

18:48.682 --> 18:52.587
meant to be archival, really, but they have to become archival.

18:53.888 --> 19:14.773
So, literally, they get locked away in these clear... Well, acetate's one thing, but in the last, like, ten years, this phenomenon, I don't even, there must be an official name for them, but they're really like these flat,

19:15.158 --> 19:23.166
fiberglass coffins, which basically allow you to look at the cover and that's about it.

19:23.967 --> 19:32.095
So I always found that it's kind of sad that you can't really enjoy it.

19:32.896 --> 19:42.145
It's a very strange fetishization of this

19:42.547 --> 19:46.773
that's meant to be open and read and enjoyed.

19:46.853 --> 20:01.554
And, you know, you talk about, you know, you can add a certain visual element to an old vintage comic book that usually is not found in, say, you know, a vintage first edition of Gatsby.

20:01.574 --> 20:09.605
I mean, it's there a little bit, but it's there ten zillion fold more in an old comic book.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.187
So I've...

20:11.656 --> 20:23.491
For me, it was more about collecting the toys because there's a way to enjoy them sitting on a shelf that you can't with a comic book, if that makes any sense at all.

20:23.852 --> 20:27.256
It does, it does.

20:27.496 --> 20:28.778
And it goes on from there.

20:28.918 --> 20:40.633
I came to learn, you know, at some point that Batman was hugely popular in Japan.

20:41.035 --> 20:43.980
when the TV show came out in the late 60s.

20:45.162 --> 20:48.006
So there was all this stuff that was made over there.

20:50.169 --> 20:59.023
And it's just fascinating because there was no sort of stylistic quality control on any of it.

20:59.084 --> 21:04.993
Even though it was officially licensed, it verges on folk art.

21:05.153 --> 21:08.899
Because they, you know, they

21:09.200 --> 21:13.605
thought nothing of making Batman's costume red, you know.

21:13.665 --> 21:15.306
You know, why not?

21:15.367 --> 21:16.308
It looks interesting.

21:16.328 --> 21:20.452
Well, because it's supposed to be blue, but they, you know, so there's all kinds of variations on that.

21:20.492 --> 21:33.786
I mean, if you, you know, if you come into the city at some point and we can arrange the time or whatever, you're right, it'd be much more interesting to show you this stuff rather than talk about it.

21:34.066 --> 21:35.528
And, you know,

21:36.301 --> 21:38.544
Are you going to be in the city over the next two weeks?

21:40.367 --> 21:41.228
We are.

21:41.349 --> 21:49.821
We're... And the only reason I ask is because I'd like to write this for the next... I've got two or three weeks before I have to turn in copy.

21:49.882 --> 21:56.752
But if it's at all possible, if it could be done, and if you're in the city... I think it's possible.

21:56.892 --> 22:03.702
We are going to... And of course now I'm totally freaking out in light of the event yesterday.

22:03.743 --> 22:04.063
Yeah.

22:04.668 --> 22:09.924
We're supposed to go to Sun Valley, Idaho next Wednesday.

22:11.990 --> 22:15.099
And there's a writer's conference out there.

22:15.661 --> 22:19.352
So we're doing that, and then we get back, I believe, the 22nd.

22:19.552 --> 22:20.293
to the 21st.

22:20.753 --> 22:21.935
Oh, we'll see.

22:22.035 --> 22:25.579
If I can give you a call or an email and if we can do it, we can do it.

22:25.619 --> 22:26.400
I'd love to see it.

22:26.540 --> 22:33.068
If only to write, to give this piece of the kind of texture that I think it should have.

22:33.508 --> 22:39.936
But let's continue with the conversation because I really do want to ask about how you, why Batman?

22:39.996 --> 22:41.998
You know, I do love that.

22:42.400 --> 22:52.874
Those two panels that you have at the beginning of the book, by the way, Robin understands that you're already accounted for, which is just fabulous.

22:53.015 --> 22:57.901
Yeah, well, my friend Chris Ware did that as a Christmas present.

22:58.923 --> 22:59.584
That's awfully nice.

22:59.604 --> 23:00.565
Yeah, it's amazing.

23:01.386 --> 23:10.579
So you probably explain this in your Batman book, but what explains this passion for Batman?

23:10.779 --> 23:11.580
Well, I sort of...

23:11.847 --> 23:22.825
I do talk about it, but I also cop out because I also say, you know, when you're obsessed with something like that the way I am, it's very hard.

23:23.346 --> 23:26.151
They defy reasoning.

23:27.493 --> 23:37.990
I mean, I was two years old when the fad hit, and I had a brother that was two years older than me.

23:38.915 --> 23:40.657
So he was, what, four?

23:40.737 --> 23:49.845
And so even though it seems we were on the young side, we were really the target age for this thing that was happening.

23:51.686 --> 23:56.411
And, you know, and we dressed up and watched the show and, you know, my dad.

23:56.431 --> 23:58.232
So you remember the show with Adam Weston?

23:58.252 --> 23:58.953
Of course.

23:59.353 --> 24:01.215
Of course.

24:02.316 --> 24:06.880
And, you know, the difference, as I say in the book, is

24:07.602 --> 24:13.510
I mean, you know, this is happening to lots of kids, you know, the way maybe Harry Potter is today.

24:16.133 --> 24:23.543
But, you know, the fat sort of exploded and then fizzled out, but I just never really got over it.

24:25.045 --> 24:27.247
And it's not like Batman went away.

24:27.267 --> 24:31.032
It just wasn't nearly as popular as it was.

24:31.413 --> 24:36.259
But what's been interesting over the, you know, following...

24:36.526 --> 24:54.872
uh what 40 years got um is the sort of waxing and waning like you'll become really popular for this or that reason for a while and then it'll fade back a bit but it's researched the good i'd say four times now

24:55.392 --> 24:56.674
Like, maybe every ten years.

24:56.754 --> 25:00.258
Actually, this very recent one that I thought was pretty good.

25:00.639 --> 25:01.139
The movie?

25:02.721 --> 25:03.002
Yeah.

25:03.102 --> 25:06.926
I like the way they really explain those early years, where he learned all this stuff.

25:06.946 --> 25:11.052
Yeah, and that's all from comics lore.

25:11.072 --> 25:12.493
I mean, they really did their homework.

25:14.576 --> 25:17.840
I even thought they maybe came up with that.

25:17.860 --> 25:20.744
I didn't know that that was all documented in the comics.

25:20.764 --> 25:21.805
No, they...

25:22.342 --> 25:28.376
I mean, they invented a few things, but most of it's all from the 70s, actually.

25:29.940 --> 25:40.384
In the comics in the 70s, Batman became more of an almost James Bond-like figure in that he was traveling all over the world doing this and that.

25:40.938 --> 25:44.282
and that whole Ra's al Ghul thing.

25:44.663 --> 25:46.345
Well, it explains how he gets the toys.

25:46.405 --> 25:48.388
It explains how he learns to be so good.

25:48.588 --> 25:49.189
Oh, yeah.

25:49.209 --> 25:50.350
Yeah, that was very clever.

25:50.691 --> 25:51.432
Yeah.

25:51.732 --> 25:52.293
Very clever.

25:52.313 --> 26:00.804
I think just as a fan and quasi-expert, what disappointed me was the ending.

26:00.824 --> 26:01.284
Exactly.

26:01.725 --> 26:03.948
I don't know if you saw Spider-Man 2.

26:04.488 --> 26:04.729
No.

26:05.590 --> 26:09.595
There's an epic battle...

26:09.845 --> 26:26.780
I guess towards the end of Spider-Man 2 between Dr. Octopus and Spider-Man aboard a moving elevated train in, you know, in New York, of course, which there isn't any in Manhattan, but they make one up anyway, and it's brilliantly done.

26:27.181 --> 26:35.788
And I just thought, you know, once that's been done in pop cinema or whatever you want to call it.

26:35.969 --> 26:37.590
Well, you know,

26:37.874 --> 26:42.639
Not even that it's a cliché, it's just that they did it and they did it perfectly, so do something else.

26:43.940 --> 26:44.601
But anyway.

26:44.981 --> 26:46.062
But it was not bad.

26:46.903 --> 26:48.044
No, it wasn't.

26:48.644 --> 26:49.725
I'm sorry.

26:50.226 --> 26:51.747
So tell me about your stuff.

26:51.828 --> 26:53.970
Tell me about some of the high spots of the collection.

26:53.990 --> 27:00.536
Is it a fairly comprehensive documentation of the Batman phenomenon?

27:01.197 --> 27:01.937
Oh, God.

27:02.858 --> 27:05.721
Well, see, I think you'd walk in and look at it and...

27:05.819 --> 27:06.981
I'd be dazzled, right?

27:07.081 --> 27:20.321
Well, not that you would be dazzled, but you would say yes, that it is that, because... Would I also say, to interrupt it, this is Chip Kidd.

27:20.341 --> 27:20.762
Okay.

27:21.343 --> 27:26.751
Because I maintain that collections really are, you know, they're just extensions of the person.

27:27.492 --> 27:31.438
Yeah, I mean, I... One of my...

27:31.840 --> 27:37.728
rehearsed lines is that when you walk into my apartment, I want it to be like you're walking into my head.

27:38.609 --> 27:40.050
I saw that in the Times piece.

27:40.231 --> 27:40.491
Yeah.

27:40.511 --> 27:41.532
That's a good line.

27:41.673 --> 27:42.974
That's why I didn't ask it.

27:42.994 --> 27:44.356
But I'll use it if you don't mind.

27:44.376 --> 27:46.879
Because it's also, it's the furniture, it's everything.

27:47.220 --> 27:49.963
It's everything all tying up into one.

27:49.983 --> 27:51.245
So do you fantasize at all?

27:51.305 --> 27:52.206
Are you ever Batman?

27:52.506 --> 27:52.767
No.

27:53.167 --> 27:59.635
I, uh... You must fantasize about something.

27:59.655 --> 28:00.196
We all do.

28:00.557 --> 28:01.678
I mean, you know...

28:01.979 --> 28:07.088
You can follow that as you want to.

28:07.128 --> 28:18.347
I don't know to what extent you want me to talk about that, but the whole, you know, like if I'm seeing somebody, do I want them to dress up as Batman in certain situations, which I won't elaborate on.

28:18.407 --> 28:20.431
Nope, that's fine, and I wasn't asking that either.

28:20.511 --> 28:21.352
No, that's okay.

28:21.593 --> 28:24.578
But no, I mean, other than that whole...

28:24.558 --> 28:30.393
I mean, certainly, if I was going to seriously fantasize, I would fantasize about being Superman, not Batman.

28:30.513 --> 28:32.738
I was going to ask about Superman, you know.

28:33.520 --> 28:41.340
I had a wonderful interview a few years, ten years or so ago, with Bohati Mukherjee, you know, the Indian-American novelist.

28:41.982 --> 28:42.162
Uh-huh.

28:42.462 --> 28:45.185
I don't even think she's a comp author, but I'm not sure.

28:45.205 --> 28:46.627
Yeah, that sounds familiar.

28:47.027 --> 28:49.190
B-H-A-R-T-I Mukaiji.

28:49.210 --> 28:51.132
She won a National Book Critics Circle Award.

28:52.213 --> 28:56.158
And she's just fascinated by the holodeck, you know, on Star Trek.

28:56.178 --> 28:56.759
Oh, yeah.

28:56.779 --> 29:00.603
And she and I were talking about the holodeck, you know, and I said, you know, it's amazing.

29:01.905 --> 29:05.449
You could go in, of course, as a guy, you could...

29:05.868 --> 29:10.296
You could fantasize, not fantasize, you could actually make love to Marilyn Monroe, you know?

29:10.817 --> 29:13.643
And of course she turns around and she says, oh, you could be Marilyn Monroe.

29:13.763 --> 29:17.851
It's just amazing the approach that you would take to the fantasy, I suppose.

29:18.552 --> 29:22.560
And the thing that always bothered me about the holodeck, and I'm assuming she's

29:22.540 --> 29:25.624
referring to the next generation as opposed to the classics?

29:25.704 --> 29:30.049
I believe so, yeah, because they really did allow you to do whatever your fantasies were.

29:30.610 --> 29:30.810
Right.

29:32.192 --> 29:46.590
It was just never clear to me, and maybe they explained it and I missed it, but it's one thing to do holograms of things, but then to make it all into solid material, that's what kind of ruined it for me, because I just thought,

29:47.178 --> 29:48.599
I just don't buy that.

29:48.860 --> 29:50.962
Well, it would be kind of fun, though, if they could.

29:51.602 --> 29:53.644
Well, certainly.

29:53.664 --> 29:54.185
Certainly.

29:54.245 --> 29:55.866
But I think that's what they were talking about.

29:56.306 --> 30:09.299
I mean, because they had any number of different episodes where, you know, people were totally fooled by holodeck-type technology into thinking that something was that it wasn't.

30:09.319 --> 30:10.580
Right.

30:10.600 --> 30:11.881
But we need to go off on that.

30:12.021 --> 30:12.922
All right.

30:13.062 --> 30:14.063
This is kind of fun.

30:14.498 --> 30:21.759
I think, I don't want to overstay my welcome here, but in your mind, is there a Dust Jacket Hall of Fame?

30:23.043 --> 30:24.126
Dust Jacket Hall of Fame.

30:25.350 --> 30:27.917
Well, do you mean...

30:28.758 --> 30:30.701
Pure Alvin Lustig, for instance.

30:31.202 --> 30:32.664
Oh, oh, oh, is that?

30:32.924 --> 30:34.226
Okay, okay.

30:34.266 --> 30:37.250
Who have you learned from, I guess, is what I'm trying to say.

30:37.450 --> 30:42.878
For your heroes in that particular, or do you have heroes in that particular area?

30:42.898 --> 30:48.747
And you have some of them, of course, in your book, but maybe you can articulate some of it for me, if you wouldn't mind.

30:49.287 --> 30:50.710
Well, certainly Lustig.

30:50.730 --> 30:53.854
The interesting thing about Lustig is...

30:54.863 --> 31:21.563
when I am compared to somebody it's usually him which is very flattering but the person that I became first aware of and actually studied in college was Dwiggins I didn't find out about Lustig until much much later until well after I was

31:22.454 --> 31:24.737
doing my thing, so to speak.

31:24.757 --> 31:28.502
So, I mean, that's not really a disclaimer.

31:28.643 --> 31:31.366
It's just, it's just, it's more of a fact.

31:31.407 --> 31:49.592
It was more of like discovering his work and thinking, oh, I guess, I guess I'm, you know, it seems like it should have influenced me more than it actually did, is what I'm trying to say, which is not to take away from the achievement at all.

31:50.028 --> 31:59.196
But, yeah, I mean, you know, for here, quantity and quality, I'd probably say he's the top.

32:00.037 --> 32:12.348
I have all of Tennessee Williams in first edition, by the way, and would be the one author, if I were to start, say, deaccessioning my collections, which are pretty interesting.

32:13.249 --> 32:16.252
The last one to go would be the Tennessee Williams.

32:16.892 --> 32:18.634
He is my...

32:19.120 --> 32:23.265
He's easily one of the most underappreciated writers.

32:23.726 --> 32:28.672
Of course, he's, I think, a great playwright of the 20th century, in my view.

32:28.872 --> 32:30.914
You really think he's underappreciated?

32:31.235 --> 32:37.162
To pick up a play, one of his plays, and to read it as fiction is what I'm trying to say.

32:37.362 --> 32:38.343
Huh.

32:38.363 --> 32:41.767
I mean, how many people do you know to pick up Tennessee Williams and read him?

32:43.389 --> 32:45.772
I'd be curious to know how many people actually do that.

32:46.153 --> 32:46.393
Huh.

32:46.762 --> 32:50.326
I mean, you think so?

32:50.446 --> 33:03.780
I mean, to pick up a Tennessee Williams play and to read it, it's a different experience to me, as much as I enjoy seeing him performed, but he's such a brilliant writer as well.

33:03.840 --> 33:09.646
I mean, his setting up of these scenes and the prose and the quality of the writing is just dazzling.

33:09.746 --> 33:10.727
I've just always...

33:11.281 --> 33:30.505
loved his uh his plays i have them all and of course lustig you know you get tennessee you get uh you get lustig as well so yeah which which actually brings up an interesting point i mean what do you think of that cover i love it the purple one i don't much care for uh on uh

33:31.649 --> 33:41.811
Yeah, that's my least, especially because it just doesn't hold up, it fades.

33:43.173 --> 33:44.376
You always have a...

33:44.862 --> 33:49.448
I happen to have a really wonderful copy of that book without the sun's spine.

33:50.128 --> 33:57.217
Do you think of these things at all as to how a dust jacket is going to survive the test of time, by the way?

33:57.237 --> 34:14.498
Well, one thing I learned very early on is that fluorescent ink is extremely unstable, which hasn't stopped me from using it, but it's certainly stopped me from storing books with fluorescent ink on them anywhere near a...

34:15.102 --> 34:16.607
a strong light source.

34:19.277 --> 34:23.070
Yes, I try to, I certainly try to think about

34:24.181 --> 34:29.389
what a book that I work on will look like in five years or ten years.

34:29.970 --> 34:30.951
You do think about that.

34:30.971 --> 34:31.993
Oh, my God, yeah.

34:32.173 --> 34:32.333
Good.

34:32.774 --> 34:53.445
I mean, I think throughout the 90s, there was this real sort of explosion in the graphic design world because in terms of type and in terms of computer-manipulated imagery, which continues, there were all of these

34:54.185 --> 35:14.584
graphic designers, a lot of them from California, doing all this really wild experimental stuff and it was getting a lot of attention, continues to get a lot of attention, but I just didn't feel like that I should emulate that really.

35:16.346 --> 35:22.892
First of all, because I didn't feel it as an artistic impulse or however you want to call it, but also

35:23.159 --> 35:38.081
you know, this whole notion that, you know, these hardcover books are hopefully going to be around forever, and, you know, you see certain book jackets from a certain era, and you just think, oh, my God, that just looks so dated.

35:40.043 --> 35:46.753
And I think there was... That definitely goes into...

35:47.054 --> 35:58.248
a lot of my thought processes when designing the book jacket, which is, I think, maybe why my stuff in comparison is rather tame to a lot.

35:59.049 --> 36:06.479
I mean, now at the same time, I've been described as avant-garde and edgy, which I've never understood.

36:08.541 --> 36:16.892
I think maybe just everything's relative, and what might seem edgy to John Updike is really

36:17.648 --> 36:22.935
because he's just something that's of a much more conservative taste.

36:23.035 --> 36:28.603
Uptake says you bring a playful thinginess to the task, which is kind of a cute way of describing it.

36:28.623 --> 36:34.051
Yeah, no, I mean, look, I'm thrilled with the introduction that he wrote to the book.

36:34.071 --> 36:36.815
I mean, it was just... Hunter-Gatherer, which is kind of cool.

36:36.835 --> 36:37.656
Do you agree with that?

36:37.796 --> 36:38.677
Oh, absolutely.

36:39.078 --> 36:39.759
Oh, my God.

36:41.621 --> 36:45.867
That's both literal and figuratively accurate.

36:46.218 --> 36:47.199
I was dazzled.

36:47.740 --> 36:55.329
I knew he was from Shillington, of course, and that's amazing to have two superstars.

36:55.349 --> 36:59.934
Well, his star is a lot more super than mine.

36:59.954 --> 37:01.236
Yeah, but you're what, 41, 42?

37:01.536 --> 37:03.358
You're a kid.

37:03.378 --> 37:03.819
Well.

37:04.099 --> 37:10.627
You've still got many, many years of productive work, and what is it now, 1,600 or so?

37:10.947 --> 37:16.073
Well, that turned out to be a myth that I perpetuated because when

37:16.593 --> 37:32.497
my assistant and I basically hunkered down and, I mean, that figure I always came up with as a mathematical equation of, okay, I, you know, Knopf does three lists a year.

37:33.057 --> 37:43.493
I usually do upwards of 10 books a list, plus there's freelance and blah, blah, blah, and came up with 1,500 like five years ago.

37:43.893 --> 37:44.254
Well,

37:44.842 --> 37:48.505
When we sat down and really counted everything, it was really closer to 900.

37:48.605 --> 37:48.846
Okay.

37:49.006 --> 37:51.308
Oh, so you're pushing 1,000 then.

37:52.489 --> 37:52.869
Yeah.

37:53.990 --> 37:55.071
So we'll say about 1,000?

37:55.712 --> 37:56.372
I guess so.

37:56.392 --> 37:57.073
Any favorites?

37:58.814 --> 37:58.874
No.

37:58.894 --> 38:01.897
It's like asking a person to pick a favorite among his kids.

38:02.718 --> 38:02.838
Right.

38:02.858 --> 38:03.559
You can't do it.

38:04.339 --> 38:06.321
Any you wish you'd have another shot at?

38:07.822 --> 38:08.763
Oh, certainly.

38:09.003 --> 38:13.127
I mean, the one example in the book is...

38:13.495 --> 38:15.577
Sometimes you do get another shot at it.

38:16.017 --> 38:26.946
And, uh, the best example was, um, The Shock of the New, by, uh, by Robert Hughes.

38:28.948 --> 38:29.329
Good book.

38:29.829 --> 38:33.772
Um, hmm, I wonder what that noise is.

38:34.773 --> 38:35.274
Right here?

38:36.555 --> 38:40.758
It might be, it could be another incoming call.

38:41.159 --> 38:41.839
Do you want to take it?

38:42.160 --> 38:42.760
Uh, no.

38:42.942 --> 38:58.101
So I did a cover for that in paperback when it was revised, and it was really bad, and I was young, and how it got approved, I don't know, but it did.

38:58.161 --> 39:08.273
And then about maybe eight years later, we repackaged it again, and I came up with a much better idea for it, was able to redo it.

39:08.333 --> 39:12.358
But yeah, I mean, there's...

39:13.098 --> 39:25.003
There's lots of reasons that a jacket may turn out bad, everything from I'm out of inspiration to authors that micromanage it to death, and everything in between.

39:27.067 --> 39:34.482
But, you know, I would happily say that in my case, I think the...

39:34.782 --> 39:37.811
More interesting ones outnumber the less interesting ones.

39:38.674 --> 39:42.425
Just briefly, and then I'll let you go because we're pushing it now.

39:42.566 --> 39:45.916
I think that's an awful lot to ask one person.

39:46.096 --> 39:47.661
I suppose if there's any other...

39:48.147 --> 40:04.556
jacket designer that approaches you, certainly not in terms of celebrity, but people will say a Wendell Minor jacket, for instance, is, you know, I can recognize a minor jacket, I can recognize a Chip Kidd jacket instantly.

40:06.759 --> 40:08.282
Would you, would you, uh,

40:09.258 --> 40:12.843
I don't even know what the question is, but there are others.

40:12.863 --> 40:17.029
Who among your contemporaries, might I ask, would you say you admire?

40:17.490 --> 40:23.539
Well, I think the other people that I work with at Knopf are tremendously talented.

40:25.642 --> 40:30.289
My boss, the actual art director is a woman named Carol Devine Carson.

40:30.329 --> 40:33.173
I'm not even the official art director she is.

40:34.047 --> 40:35.528
She's great.

40:35.989 --> 40:37.470
It liberates you in a way, I would bet.

40:37.690 --> 40:38.251
Yes.

40:38.271 --> 40:44.057
Oh, believe me, I would not want... Then you've got the administrator shit down.

40:44.077 --> 40:46.179
Plus, you know, the C word, cookbooks.

40:46.199 --> 40:51.524
You have to deal with all the cookbooks, which are real problems.

40:53.065 --> 40:59.291
John Gall, G-A-L-L, the art director of vintage for quite some time now, vintage paperbacks.

40:59.371 --> 41:00.272
He's amazing.

41:00.673 --> 41:03.295
I think somebody should...

41:03.950 --> 41:05.694
do a book of his stuff.

41:08.099 --> 41:13.712
Because that's a, God, talk about a logistical nightmare of a job.

41:13.812 --> 41:15.335
And he just does it so well.

41:15.476 --> 41:16.558
I mean, he does

41:17.551 --> 41:20.455
trade paperbacks better than anybody.

41:20.555 --> 41:25.042
That is interesting because, you know, like my deal with Knopf is it's a Knopf vintage.

41:25.082 --> 41:26.104
Sure.

41:26.144 --> 41:28.828
So you're going to go from a Knopf cover to a vintage cover.

41:28.868 --> 41:30.090
Are they going to be different?

41:30.110 --> 41:31.552
Well, not necessarily.

41:31.612 --> 41:43.850
It's a very strange process that I only partially understand, but sometimes vintage will adapt the cover and sometimes they won't.

41:44.831 --> 41:46.714
And I...

41:46.846 --> 41:51.492
It can sometimes really alarm me and sometimes make me angry.

41:51.533 --> 41:54.517
And it's not the art director's decision.

41:54.877 --> 41:57.841
It's almost always an editorial thing.

41:58.522 --> 42:06.874
And what I've never understood is if a book does well in hardcover... I can understand if a book underperforms.

42:08.036 --> 42:09.037
It doesn't meet expectations.

42:09.097 --> 42:12.081
All right, let's do a new cover for the paperback and see what happens.

42:12.802 --> 42:14.845
But sometimes you...

42:15.365 --> 42:16.706
don't get that scenario.

42:16.786 --> 42:21.191
You get, oh, you know, they changed the cover even though it did well in our cover, but I don't know.

42:21.211 --> 42:23.053
Anyway, I'm going off topic here.

42:23.073 --> 42:23.833
That's good.

42:23.993 --> 42:25.955
I like the answer.

42:26.116 --> 42:26.436
Go ahead.

42:27.036 --> 42:41.811
The thing about Wendell Minor is that he's also an illustrator, so I think that makes his stuff a lot more recognizable because you recognize his illustrative style.

42:42.466 --> 43:09.773
there's a guy named paul sar who's brilliant s-a-h-r-e um who does a lot of things other than book covers but he does book covers um there's a guy named rodrigo corral who was a student of mine at the school of visual arts who uh continues to do interesting stuff he does all the chuck palahonic stuff um there's a lot of really good interesting people

43:10.630 --> 43:11.792
making book covers.

43:12.393 --> 43:16.559
Not to suggest a cliché, but is it a golden age of jacket illustration?

43:17.140 --> 43:17.801
Oh, God.

43:20.765 --> 43:21.806
I have no idea.

43:21.987 --> 43:26.533
I think a question like that can only be answered in retrospect.

43:26.694 --> 43:29.037
And by people who observe them from a distance.

43:29.057 --> 43:29.478
Yeah.

43:29.798 --> 43:34.545
I mean, there's certainly already, I think,

43:36.314 --> 44:01.765
i think the golden age of this and in my uh in my opinion will be the 90s will be like the mid 90s really i think so right um because i think publishing in general was a lot healthier at that point um

44:03.635 --> 44:04.316
I don't know.

44:04.476 --> 44:07.380
It's not something that I should speculate on, really.

44:07.400 --> 44:08.041
I like it, though.

44:08.902 --> 44:11.726
Are we becoming more conservative now, less adventurous?

44:12.066 --> 44:13.087
I think there's that.

44:13.608 --> 44:14.609
There's definitely that.

44:14.770 --> 44:15.871
Budgets are shrinking.

44:16.572 --> 44:23.181
Now, you know, I'm also a great believer in that really good design doesn't, shouldn't really have anything to do with money.

44:25.123 --> 44:26.765
But everything has something to do with money.

44:27.026 --> 44:28.948
Well, sometimes, yes, and sometimes not.

44:28.968 --> 44:30.110
And trade publishing, to be sure.

44:30.130 --> 44:31.191
Interesting.

44:31.211 --> 44:31.752
Interesting.

44:32.204 --> 44:38.272
You know, sometimes a two-color jacket can be a lot more interesting than a bad four-color jacket.

44:39.373 --> 44:40.394
You know, that kind of thing.

44:40.975 --> 44:45.221
So, we'll see.

44:45.261 --> 44:47.784
I mean, I'm still enjoying it.

44:47.884 --> 44:49.005
I love Knopf.

44:49.066 --> 44:51.368
It's a great place.

44:52.210 --> 44:55.714
You know, it's undergone so much change.

44:56.015 --> 44:59.220
since I started there, from almost the beginning.

44:59.460 --> 45:01.343
Well, you were coming as Gottlieb was going.

45:01.664 --> 45:01.904
Yeah.

45:01.924 --> 45:04.168
I can't believe it was 20 years ago that he was leaving.

45:04.288 --> 45:11.500
That's amazing, because I was reviewing books back in the late 70s when I first started as a book review editor.

45:11.800 --> 45:17.329
So I've been around top books for a long time.

45:17.730 --> 45:18.831
I couldn't believe it when I read it.

45:18.932 --> 45:22.377
Was it really 20 years ago that Gottlieb left?

45:22.863 --> 45:25.165
He never really left, of course.

45:25.185 --> 45:26.727
Well, no, it's weird.

45:26.747 --> 45:47.309
As a matter of fact, we had launched a week and a half ago, and Bob is still an editor-at-large, and often there he was, you know, pitching this book that he was going to be editing on a biography of Lincoln Kirstein, and it was bizarre.

45:47.329 --> 45:49.191
It was like, as much as this changed,

45:49.778 --> 45:51.984
There's a lot about it that's still the same.

45:52.144 --> 45:58.119
I don't want to take up too much... I think I've got a lot of stuff to work with here.

45:58.139 --> 46:02.370
I'm going to take the tape with me, get down the tape this weekend and work on it.

46:02.671 --> 46:07.555
If you don't mind, I'll get back in touch if there's need to follow up on anything.

46:07.856 --> 46:09.777
Yeah, and you can email or call.

46:09.857 --> 46:10.658
Email or call.

46:10.798 --> 46:15.983
And if there's a chance to come by at some point, it doesn't have to be urgently over the next couple of weeks.

46:16.083 --> 46:18.985
I think, you know, the summer is still the summer.

46:19.025 --> 46:22.949
But I would love to come by at some point if it's okay.

46:23.149 --> 46:23.489
Sure.

46:23.810 --> 46:31.176
And certainly when I come in to come up and introduce myself to Vicki, which we want to do.

46:31.426 --> 46:32.667
sooner rather than later.

46:32.747 --> 46:36.171
If you're around, it would be nice to say hello.

46:36.631 --> 46:38.914
And I'd love to talk about your thoughts on paper.

46:40.255 --> 46:40.455
Yeah.

46:40.575 --> 46:41.416
But not today.

46:41.496 --> 46:43.038
Let me get going on the project.

46:43.919 --> 46:45.981
It's really going to be a very interesting project.

46:46.181 --> 46:48.784
I definitely have thoughts on paper.

46:48.804 --> 46:56.071
But I am not, you know, the interesting thing about graphic design, there's so many different aspects of it.

46:56.111 --> 46:58.834
Like some people are obsessed with typography.

46:59.033 --> 47:05.143
Um, I would not say I am obsessed with it, but of course I have an interest in it.

47:06.004 --> 47:07.967
Uh, there's some people who are obsessed with paper.

47:08.889 --> 47:09.970
I am not, frankly.

47:10.130 --> 47:16.841
I mean, I, it's like the, it's like the judge's, um, definition of pornography.

47:17.182 --> 47:20.767
You know, I just know the right paper when I see it.

47:21.148 --> 47:23.792
Um, and, uh,

47:24.278 --> 47:25.620
So I don't know.

47:25.700 --> 47:27.963
I would not be a very interesting person to talk about.

47:28.063 --> 47:29.845
Okay.

47:30.145 --> 47:32.328
I appreciate your candor on that, too.

47:33.289 --> 47:33.710
Okay.

47:33.790 --> 47:34.370
Well, listen.

47:34.551 --> 47:35.532
Do you want to say hello?

47:35.672 --> 47:37.034
I would, actually, if you don't mind.

47:37.054 --> 47:37.334
Okay.

47:37.354 --> 47:38.435
And it's Nicholas?

47:38.536 --> 47:39.577
Nick Baz Baines.

47:39.617 --> 47:41.439
Nicholas, but Nick is fine.

47:41.499 --> 47:48.688
And just to introduce myself and not to take up too much of his time, but to explain what I'm doing on Longfellow and also on Yale.

47:48.708 --> 47:54.235
It's two separate projects, but two projects that I would love to have as considered...

47:54.620 --> 47:59.936
reaction and response to that I would use in print for Smithsonian and also for the Yale book.

48:00.337 --> 48:02.163
All right, well, just explain it to him.

48:02.243 --> 48:02.905
Hold on a moment.

48:02.925 --> 48:03.607
Thank you so much.

48:03.627 --> 48:04.831
I'm going to shut off the tape real quick.

48:05.112 --> 48:06.857
This is a writer named Nicholas...
