WEBVTT

00:02.630 --> 00:07.017
I'm talking to Rob Butler.

00:07.878 --> 00:12.064
Are you familiar with the Volcroft's book, Speak to Memories?

00:13.427 --> 00:13.507
Yes.

00:13.527 --> 00:15.209
It's been ages since I read it.

00:15.229 --> 00:17.913
It was a wonderful book, yeah.

00:17.933 --> 00:26.807
There certainly are some resonances out there in terms of what I think you're trying to, what you're hoping to accomplish with the Volcroft.

00:27.087 --> 00:29.972
It's quite a striking departure for you.

00:29.992 --> 00:30.713
Oh, it is.

00:32.296 --> 00:38.104
based on some of the reviews that I went, I think you recognized the risk involved.

00:38.124 --> 00:39.946
Poor Gail didn't get it at all.

00:41.048 --> 00:42.790
It leads me to something.

00:42.830 --> 00:45.594
The book reviews the reviewers in a very personal way.

00:47.096 --> 00:47.817
Inevitably so.

00:47.897 --> 00:53.244
Of course, they know more about that.

00:53.985 --> 00:58.171
I don't talk or write about other reviewers anyway.

00:58.531 --> 01:02.016
But I thought that Tristan's piece in The Times

01:02.198 --> 01:08.809
And I'm wondering if it's breaking down according to gender.

01:08.829 --> 01:14.778
Interestingly enough, if it's breaking down according to gender, you decided to do powder trans.

01:14.878 --> 01:26.737
I'm finding that women like this book a lot more consistently.

01:27.098 --> 01:29.742
The people that I think will not get the book.

01:31.139 --> 01:35.504
are those people, and this could be male or female, but in a hunch it's more men than women.

01:37.827 --> 02:00.876
If you do not have already your own personality, which a book critic cannot use his intellect to separate himself from, if you do not already have a very serious and loving appreciation of women and their bodies, then you're not going to get this book at all.

02:01.531 --> 02:13.968
And that's where I found that the reviews that have been baffled are hostile to the book, have broken down, and it's been mostly men.

02:14.769 --> 02:17.173
You know, they just don't know what all the lyricism's about.

02:17.213 --> 02:25.585
They find the book, you know, too overheated, too lyrical, and repetitive.

02:25.645 --> 02:28.028
Now, if they see this book as repetitive,

02:28.531 --> 02:31.636
They missed the humor, too.

02:31.656 --> 02:33.599
Yeah, they missed the humor as well.

02:33.619 --> 02:34.000
Yeah.

02:34.160 --> 02:40.470
I read the years before I looked at the book, and neither one of them mentioned the humor.

02:40.490 --> 02:40.971
That's true.

02:41.171 --> 02:47.181
Even Chris was wondering, you know, and thank God Chris understood a lot about this book.

02:47.819 --> 02:49.881
He did these bad aspects of it.

02:49.901 --> 02:52.024
Treat me with respect, too, which is very important.

02:52.044 --> 02:52.444
He did.

02:52.704 --> 02:53.245
He did.

02:53.645 --> 02:54.666
He did it as well.

02:54.686 --> 02:55.227
He did, too.

02:55.247 --> 02:56.668
She treated me with respect.

02:57.009 --> 02:59.311
She didn't understand what the heck.

02:59.331 --> 03:01.494
She thought this was, you know, I don't know why.

03:01.734 --> 03:02.415
And it's interesting.

03:02.435 --> 03:17.691
A woman who is so smart and careful as a reviewer, the deep personalness of her reaction is really indicated by the absolutely false assertion that most of these italicized whisperings from the women

03:17.975 --> 03:20.438
are in praise of Ira's performance.

03:20.458 --> 03:27.788
That was a very odd thing for her to assert, because there's almost none of that in what the women talk about.

03:27.848 --> 03:31.933
You know, it's really quite different from that.

03:32.273 --> 03:36.559
So anyway, I knew this was going to happen.

03:36.599 --> 03:47.593
You know, you can't write vividly and deeply about sexuality without the book having a kind of Rorschach effect, you know, in a certain way.

03:48.350 --> 03:50.313
But that goes with the territory.

03:50.693 --> 03:53.436
I've not been one to share risks, as you know.

03:54.478 --> 03:55.279
Tell me about it.

03:55.860 --> 03:57.281
How long have you been working on this book?

03:57.301 --> 03:58.803
Is this pre-seed work on it?

03:59.905 --> 04:01.967
In a sense, I've been working on it all my life.

04:02.007 --> 04:07.494
As far as sitting around and actually writing it, it was about three years.

04:08.195 --> 04:18.188
Interestingly enough, Nick, I didn't even conceive this as a book until after I wrote A Good Step from Strange Mountain.

04:19.096 --> 04:29.493
And it was because of, directly because of, interestingly enough, the access that I suddenly found in my artistic unconscious to women's voices.

04:30.455 --> 04:43.517
In good sense, seven of those fifteen pieces are written in the voices of women, and literally every woman I have ever talked to who's read the book remarks on the authenticity of those women's voices.

04:44.122 --> 04:56.620
Suddenly, when I had access in my unconscious and my imagination to women's voices from the inside, that's what let me write about male heterosexuality.

04:57.402 --> 05:13.285
That, you know, Ira, like myself, strictly heterosexual, but it was only when I and Ira couldn't find the women's voices inside us that I could really talk about and communicate more.

05:13.670 --> 05:22.900
completely the whole essence of sexuality, because it's the ultimate kind of intimacy.

05:23.320 --> 05:34.593
Again, I don't want it to appear that we're rebutting her review, but let's use it as what she does.

05:34.613 --> 05:35.353
No, no, no.

05:35.374 --> 05:36.775
But she does seem to suggest

05:37.345 --> 06:01.851
that iris is living in a fantasy world but i don't think that this is fantasy i mean certainly we're daydream we weren't thinking it and i was still reliving it i mean that happens all the time striking things i could walk out in an airport and then smaller that gas on back of my aircraft exactly that absolutely and i mean i can feel the heat i can feel that

06:02.388 --> 06:06.753
I can smell the grinning tires on the light neck and, you know, the whole thing.

06:06.793 --> 06:08.434
But just a sharp little smell like that.

06:09.896 --> 06:16.363
Coming up the whole time of your life, a whole place, a personality, an intimacy, of course.

06:16.383 --> 06:18.946
Strong and indulging in that.

06:18.966 --> 06:19.526
Absolutely.

06:19.706 --> 06:21.528
I don't think it's fantasy, for se.

06:21.568 --> 06:21.729
No.

06:22.129 --> 06:22.429
No.

06:22.449 --> 06:23.370
It's odd.

06:23.531 --> 06:30.538
I don't know why the book, as with any work of art, is exaggerated and heightened in a sense, you know?

06:31.042 --> 06:41.525
It's like people expect to know, watch him brush his teeth and eat his dinner and think about work and so forth.

06:41.545 --> 06:43.188
That's a requirement.

06:43.770 --> 06:49.422
But it is about that part of human beings, men.

06:50.802 --> 07:02.519
that has an ongoing and inevitable focus on intimacy and the yearning for intimacy.

07:07.647 --> 07:18.042
It's very realistic in that sense because that's the inner landscape of men in regards to the women that they have loved and continue to love.

07:18.629 --> 07:26.637
That's the territory that I wanted to eliminate, which is rarely eliminated.

07:27.497 --> 07:35.765
It's, in fact, the impulse that men have to desire women.

07:37.307 --> 07:47.877
It's to, in fact, what seems to outsiders to be only over inconsequential or casual things.

07:48.717 --> 07:59.415
That impulse has been, in the media and the pop culture, has been trivialized almost exclusively.

07:59.435 --> 08:04.524
It is treated like a trivial, childish, you know, objectifying impulse.

08:05.325 --> 08:11.275
And in some men, many men, perhaps, that's true.

08:11.295 --> 08:12.497
But for many other men,

08:12.983 --> 08:16.128
It is a deeply serious impulse.

08:16.248 --> 08:25.143
It is the impulse to cosmic connection, to the mysteries of unique individual personality, and that's what the book is trying to get at.

08:25.623 --> 08:36.561
I think that the success, and I don't mean commercial or critical, but we wait for ourselves, and we're happy with it.

08:36.760 --> 08:39.864
Right, but certainly you were pleased with things, isn't it?

08:39.884 --> 08:40.084
Yes.

08:40.404 --> 08:49.696
And where seven voices were female voices, did that embolden you, you think, to believe that this was possible?

08:49.856 --> 08:50.417
Absolutely.

08:50.697 --> 08:53.921
It was the only thing that made the book possible to me.

08:54.962 --> 09:04.033
If I were, as a creator of this book, limited to the male voice and the male perspective,

09:05.515 --> 09:30.088
I could not have understood the complexities that I think the book understands.

09:30.980 --> 09:33.603
who I've talked to perhaps three times or so.

09:33.764 --> 09:43.616
Mary Gordon, she said repeatedly how difficult it is for her to do, as a writer, male sexuality.

09:45.219 --> 09:46.000
Yes.

09:46.380 --> 09:50.465
She did have a man in a couple of novellas, but she tried.

09:50.886 --> 09:53.249
Right.

09:53.629 --> 09:56.553
But clearly this couldn't intimidate you in any way.

09:56.854 --> 09:59.197
No, it would have some years, several years ago.

09:59.217 --> 09:59.417
I mean,

10:00.157 --> 10:03.983
It's been an evolutionary thing, my coming to be able to write this book.

10:04.764 --> 10:09.711
You know, it's taken 49 years of loving a lot of women and listening to them very closely.

10:10.833 --> 10:25.675
And a certain amount of plumbing deeper and deeper into what I've referred to as the artistic unconscious, the artistic unconscious, in order to finally make my way down to this depth.

10:28.118 --> 10:32.222
with enough technique and craft and enough life experience to pull all that together.

10:33.444 --> 10:44.696
You know, it's a coming together of a lot of forces inside me and inside my work to be able to write this book.

10:44.716 --> 10:50.362
It is, by the way, the first book of a trilogy of novels about human sexuality.

10:52.484 --> 10:54.987
Ira will not go forward as a character.

10:56.553 --> 11:03.023
which I'm tentatively calling Now the Silence, will be set in Vietnam.

11:03.143 --> 11:07.971
Can't get away from it.

11:07.991 --> 11:08.933
No, no.

11:08.953 --> 11:12.418
And of course, I don't go to Vietnam with the same intent that most people do.

11:12.438 --> 11:14.281
It's not a political thing.

11:14.301 --> 11:17.186
It's just a vivid, wonderful place.

11:17.226 --> 11:18.708
My youth in Paris or whatever.

11:19.289 --> 11:21.012
Saigon is an extraordinary city.

11:21.192 --> 11:23.235
The people are remarkably...

11:23.536 --> 11:25.298
And I just got back from Vietnam.

11:25.418 --> 11:26.800
Of our lifetime.

11:26.860 --> 11:28.682
Not incidentally, right?

11:28.742 --> 11:32.767
Of our generation.

11:32.787 --> 11:33.047
Exactly.

11:33.067 --> 11:35.991
But, um... You think so?

11:36.571 --> 11:38.994
I've been 69, 70, 71.

11:39.054 --> 11:39.755
71, right?

11:39.895 --> 11:41.097
Yeah, I am.

11:43.259 --> 11:44.821
But I just got back from Vietnam.

11:45.522 --> 11:46.183
It's been a month there.

11:47.845 --> 11:50.488
It's still... Saigon is still the most wonderful city.

11:51.903 --> 11:57.390
Yeah, I think everybody's calling it Saigon.

11:58.131 --> 12:00.854
There's no resemblance to a communist country whatsoever.

12:00.874 --> 12:01.014
Really?

12:01.675 --> 12:04.879
You cannot find an image of Marx or Marx.

12:04.899 --> 12:05.259
Nothing.

12:05.279 --> 12:06.321
That's exactly right.

12:07.562 --> 12:11.307
That's exactly right.

12:11.627 --> 12:14.611
They have always been incredibly pragmatic people.

12:14.631 --> 12:19.297
And as soon as the failures of the communist system are clear to the Vietnamese, they changed it.

12:19.317 --> 12:19.497
You know?

12:20.422 --> 12:24.908
The peasants own the land now, in perpetuity, the rights of the land.

12:24.928 --> 12:30.636
The government technically owns it, but the crown technically owns all the land in England, you know?

12:31.598 --> 12:36.945
So, it's a remarkable thing, and, you know, with this lifting of the embargo, I think, we're on the right path.

12:37.626 --> 12:38.688
Let's get back to it.

12:38.708 --> 12:44.095
Anyway, so now we... So, but Saigon is, to my senses, what London is to my mind.

12:45.517 --> 12:48.842
And it's a new quote.

12:48.862 --> 12:49.703
There you go.

12:50.847 --> 12:54.532
I'm always seeing my own story in my head.

12:54.552 --> 12:55.093
Oh, yeah, of course.

12:56.215 --> 12:57.597
Let me just go off that bit.

12:57.617 --> 12:58.498
Worcester, of course, too.

12:58.678 --> 13:00.200
Worcester's my base.

13:00.220 --> 13:01.021
Your base, yeah.

13:02.964 --> 13:18.306
So, novel silence is going to be actually, you know, I've always recoiled, as you know, from the label of Vietnam novelist, which is a

13:18.590 --> 13:24.558
I may have said to you before, to me, it sounds like calling Monet a lily pad painter, you know.

13:26.381 --> 13:31.749
But this will be, in fact, a novel about human sexuality.

13:32.530 --> 13:47.211
The second in the series, an American GI, former GI, goes back in late 93, and meets and falls deeply in love with a beautiful Vietnamese woman in her late 20s.

13:47.691 --> 13:48.192
How old is that?

13:49.302 --> 13:50.283
He was there in 1966.

13:50.303 --> 13:52.165
He was there in 1966.

13:52.626 --> 13:57.531
I'm going to tell you something about the book, which I don't think I want to read yet.

13:57.551 --> 14:00.014
He's in Vietnam in 1966 and comes home.

14:01.075 --> 14:02.777
Goes back in September of 1993.

14:04.979 --> 14:05.660
Where does he go back?

14:05.961 --> 14:06.801
Recapture?

14:06.841 --> 14:07.702
Yeah, yeah.

14:08.243 --> 14:15.691
He had a kind of, yeah, he had a kind of, right, midlife crisis, whatever.

14:15.711 --> 14:17.233
Relationships fell apart and so forth.

14:19.205 --> 14:24.190
They make this beautiful woman, like twice, and they fall in love.

14:24.210 --> 14:30.016
And they fall in love, by the way, in a way, you know, they whisper is not a unified field theory of sexuality.

14:30.056 --> 14:34.541
Ira, at the end of the book, is left in a place where he comes to realize he's not whole.

14:35.642 --> 14:47.895
Well, this relationship, and now the silence, is a very deep one and seems mutually exclusive, even, in a way that Ira has not found.

14:48.213 --> 14:59.504
Well, they passionately consummate their relationship and begin then to go through the bureaucracy there to find a way to marry and take her back to the States.

15:00.706 --> 15:05.510
And in that process, they discover that she is his daughter.

15:05.530 --> 15:08.894
Uh-huh.

15:09.074 --> 15:12.938
I won't use this at all, of course, but, you know.

15:12.958 --> 15:18.203
I'm probably not going to keep a secret to that eventually, but right now it's true as Russell wrote a book.

15:18.470 --> 15:34.748
But think of the metaphorical implications of that.

15:34.808 --> 15:41.876
Have I ever searched that?

15:41.896 --> 15:47.683
My third, the third novel trilogy will be in the voice of Karen Granger.

15:48.220 --> 15:51.104
You have this whole thing straight out, then, pretty well figured.

15:51.444 --> 15:53.246
What are you trying to say in the three books?

15:53.306 --> 15:54.808
What is... Well, no, yeah.

15:55.289 --> 15:56.230
That's what I mean.

15:56.250 --> 16:14.312
Is it three aspects of sexuality, or is it just... We're moving toward a... We're moving on, you know, thematically... The deep seriousness of the male impulse to love a lot of women is rendered in this book, and I respond how long.

16:15.676 --> 16:22.945
Now the silence is a relationship that in all ways is whole, except the terrible tragic horror.

16:24.767 --> 16:39.945
Karen Granger intrudes me, and I don't want to look ahead too much yet, but she will be moving even, you know, with her I will find out whether such a relationship is possible.

16:40.567 --> 16:52.447
a kind of relationship that would be... This is why I don't like the tape all the time, because it's a notebook, you're always playing, and I'm sure it's on tape, but you're saying an exploration of human sexuality or male sexuality?

16:52.467 --> 16:52.767
A human.

16:53.188 --> 16:53.929
Yeah, sure.

16:54.450 --> 16:59.198
Even they whisper, transcend male sexuality, you know, that's the hook.

17:00.119 --> 17:07.131
But with those women's voices, it really is, you know, and even beyond sexuality, human intimacy,

17:08.343 --> 17:12.169
which is perhaps an even deeper issue.

17:12.189 --> 17:14.112
Tell me about the risks.

17:14.393 --> 17:16.736
Were you cognizant of the risks you were taking?

17:16.997 --> 17:18.179
Oh, sure.

17:18.739 --> 17:19.340
Absolutely.

17:19.821 --> 17:24.068
It's not imaginative.

17:24.088 --> 17:25.270
It really did change your life.

17:25.290 --> 17:31.980
It did, although this book was virtually done by the time... But all of a sudden now there are new expectations placed out there.

17:32.000 --> 17:32.301
Yeah, sure.

17:32.601 --> 17:36.207
Well, you know, except that I've always placed the highest expectations on myself.

17:36.575 --> 17:44.247
If the expectation of the poetry is that I continue to start repeating myself now, playing a case, then I defy that expectation.

17:44.527 --> 17:48.213
Another good question.

17:48.233 --> 17:48.613
Yeah.

17:49.274 --> 17:54.122
This is what you get when you interview me early in the tour here.

17:55.424 --> 18:01.774
So I've always placed the highest demand on myself possible.

18:03.336 --> 18:05.299
When I was writing an obscurity,

18:05.853 --> 18:07.034
So it's not going to change now.

18:07.054 --> 18:09.877
If anything, winning the poetry, the monkey's off my back.

18:09.917 --> 18:22.631
You know, I don't have to, I don't have to, to, not that I ever would have, but any tiny impulse to try to curry favor is gone.

18:23.632 --> 18:30.079
And I'm happy now to write the books that are the best and deepest and most challenging books I can.

18:32.342 --> 18:34.324
Do you feel that he'll do stories?

18:34.692 --> 18:35.653
Oh, yes.

18:35.714 --> 18:40.280
I have two books of short stories in my head that I will be doing.

18:40.320 --> 18:44.847
In fact, I'll probably slip one of those in between Now the Silence and the third book in the trilogy.

18:45.629 --> 18:46.430
But this is interesting.

18:46.450 --> 18:47.992
This hasn't really been stated yet.

18:48.353 --> 18:50.876
You've already done a trilogy, of course.

18:50.937 --> 18:51.417
Yes.

18:51.738 --> 18:54.702
So tell me about the work.

18:55.443 --> 18:56.485
I don't know.

18:56.705 --> 18:59.890
I like the...

19:01.152 --> 19:15.310
I like the notion of, I mean, the landscape of my imagination is kind of a whole, so that the books have interconnections anyway.

19:15.330 --> 19:24.581
And as in The Whistler, for instance, that Sharon Granger is a very important character.

19:26.203 --> 19:27.685
Not many words have been on her.

19:28.446 --> 19:30.889
She's kind of like the Holy Grail.

19:31.156 --> 19:32.437
sexually.

19:38.523 --> 19:47.311
And yet, when I created her, she has a kind of resonance on into my imagination.

19:49.073 --> 20:00.724
And I get intrigued about going back to her, so... You mentioned the voices were there, and also the

20:01.396 --> 20:03.758
the resolution that you can resolve that you could do it.

20:05.039 --> 20:10.064
But I'm wondering, is this a plotted thing, or is this one of these organic kinds of decisions?

20:10.084 --> 20:12.026
No, it's an organic thing.

20:13.728 --> 20:29.783
In fact, I distinguish between, for my students, between literature and non-literature on that very basis, that non-literature you can identify by the fact that the writer

20:31.163 --> 21:01.103
knows before the object is created the effect the idea the theme the attitude the you know position that he wants the book to have and it constructs a thing to do that the artistic impulse impulse toward literature is that the that the writer has an in koa sense of the world's order behind the chaos

21:01.285 --> 21:02.206
a vision of order.

21:04.709 --> 21:16.442
But the writer doesn't really understand that vision, doesn't really quite know what it is until he's actually created the object.

21:16.502 --> 21:22.269
So the actual creation of the art object is as much an act of exploration as it is of expression.

21:25.012 --> 21:30.178
And so it's not a plotted out

21:31.036 --> 21:37.582
I mean, do you agree with that he doesn't create the statue?

21:37.602 --> 21:38.743
He takes it away, yes.

21:38.883 --> 21:42.647
And he doesn't know quite what it looks like until all this stuff's gone.

21:42.687 --> 21:43.387
Yeah, it's there.

21:43.628 --> 21:44.649
He's there, yeah.

21:44.709 --> 21:46.590
He's just kind of unlayering it, I guess.

21:46.670 --> 21:46.991
Right.

21:48.012 --> 21:56.099
But beyond that, I would say that he doesn't even know what it quite looks like until he's finished it.

21:56.119 --> 21:59.202
Do you write physically?

21:59.222 --> 21:59.322
Sure.

22:00.010 --> 22:01.471
I mean, that book was done in two years.

22:02.753 --> 22:04.194
Word processor longhand?

22:04.715 --> 22:05.536
Word processor.

22:07.638 --> 22:11.462
So there's no way to determine how many drafts or variants there are of this thing?

22:12.503 --> 22:13.664
Not anymore.

22:14.284 --> 22:23.894
My first five novels were all written on legal pads by hand, and four of them on my lap in the Long Island Railroad.

22:24.194 --> 22:29.680
So those have lots of that kind of stuff.

22:29.963 --> 22:31.285
Yeah, you're right.

22:31.305 --> 22:34.169
That is lost too.

22:34.249 --> 22:41.359
Do you write an idea to entertain or instruct or all of these things?

22:41.379 --> 22:44.404
None of those things.

22:44.424 --> 22:53.297
I go back to what I just said about knowing the effects you wish to have before the object is created.

22:54.458 --> 22:58.384
Intent to entertain or to instruct are both

22:58.837 --> 23:00.138
preconceived effects.

23:01.600 --> 23:07.267
If I wrote books with those intents, I could not create art.

23:07.287 --> 23:17.599
I could not create a deep... I could not find my way into that place in myself that I have to go to if create a book is complex and challenging.

23:17.859 --> 23:18.099
No.

23:19.040 --> 23:28.371
I write in order to not only to express but to figure out and understand what it is that I see

23:29.144 --> 23:33.608
at the deepest levels about the way the world works or fails to.

23:34.129 --> 23:38.874
Clearly, you're writing with the idea that this will be read by other people.

23:38.974 --> 23:39.494
Oh, sure.

23:40.095 --> 23:40.455
Oh, sure.

23:40.595 --> 23:42.918
I don't know what the point is.

23:42.938 --> 23:43.538
No, no, that's true.

23:43.558 --> 23:44.920
It's not just for myself.

23:44.940 --> 23:55.310
I mean, because the seeming corollary of that is, well, I just write to please myself and everybody else be damned, because that's an easy corollary to make here.

23:56.091 --> 23:58.493
You know, some writers may take that posture.

23:58.861 --> 24:22.193
But no, no, no, I think the impulse to communicate that, to express it in a way that others will understand in that non-rational way that we understand art, I mean, that impulse is absolutely as strong as the impulse to explore.

24:22.433 --> 24:22.673
Sure.

24:25.617 --> 24:27.720
So there isn't a Bob Butler reader out there.

24:28.055 --> 24:31.260
Again, I don't have a specific reader in mind.

24:31.380 --> 24:44.301
I articulate this stuff in a way to make it clear to others who those others are, I don't know.

24:46.184 --> 24:50.451
For instance, I would hate to think about a reader

24:53.755 --> 24:59.883
in the Pacific because, again, I might start shaping the work to fit that reader.

24:59.903 --> 25:03.407
When I was in Saigon, you read, did you read all of Quixanta?

25:03.427 --> 25:06.091
Remember the story of Crickets?

25:07.112 --> 25:15.022
We had the large, strong, slow, buckled crickets and the little fast, wily fire crickets.

25:16.264 --> 25:21.771
You know, in a classroom, I would resist

25:23.742 --> 25:36.100
We all know what those crickets stood for, because it was noted that everybody, even the kids who had the charcoal crickets, rooted for the little ones.

25:36.200 --> 25:37.402
It was themselves, you know.

25:40.006 --> 25:50.121
Well, when I was in Saigon, there was a guy selling lapel pins on the street.

25:51.687 --> 25:54.090
And I would say hello to him in Vietnamese every day.

25:54.110 --> 25:58.455
We had a nice sort of hello sort of relationship, just exchanging words in Vietnamese.

25:58.995 --> 25:59.956
He was in his mid-40s.

26:00.717 --> 26:01.879
He was missing his left arm.

26:05.042 --> 26:17.917
While I was there, crickets had been translated by a Vietnamese, actually a Vietnamese government official, a guy in the foreign ministry of all things, a very literate man, loved my book.

26:17.937 --> 26:20.580
He translated crickets, and it was published while I was there.

26:21.168 --> 26:22.810
in a weekly magazine that I got.

26:24.712 --> 26:34.284
This button seller hailed me, called me over, waving the magazine.

26:34.304 --> 26:39.030
Turns out he's a former Viet Cong soldier.

26:39.050 --> 26:40.312
Lost his arm in war.

26:42.154 --> 26:46.079
And charming man.

26:46.920 --> 26:48.762
He just loved this story.

26:50.193 --> 26:53.036
And he laughed at a rich, deep laugh.

26:53.116 --> 26:54.597
He says, you know what I like the best?

26:54.898 --> 27:05.549
He says, when the man said that they always liked, you know, because I used to fight crickets too when I was a kid.

27:05.569 --> 27:10.714
The part about them always rooting for the fire crickets, he said, that's true.

27:10.854 --> 27:12.215
That's the way it happens.

27:12.296 --> 27:13.757
And he laughed his feet laughing.

27:13.777 --> 27:17.301
Here I am speaking to a living literary symbol.

27:17.481 --> 27:19.643
You know, the man who's...

27:20.028 --> 27:23.613
The very essence was what was suggested by the literature.

27:23.633 --> 27:27.559
And he's not thinking, you know, intellectually, abstractly about the story.

27:27.579 --> 27:32.266
He's responding in a visceral way to the very simple... Is that a Vietnamese edition of yours?

27:32.326 --> 27:33.628
Of the stories.

27:33.668 --> 27:35.230
The whole book has not been translated there.

27:35.250 --> 27:40.157
This was one story that was translated and published in a weekly magazine there.

27:40.177 --> 27:43.682
Was this under your auspices, or was it a pirated job?

27:43.823 --> 27:45.225
Oh, yes.

27:45.485 --> 27:47.588
How was the translation?

27:47.905 --> 27:50.467
As far as I could tell, it was good.

27:50.568 --> 27:51.889
Yeah, I used to be fluent.

27:51.969 --> 27:54.551
I'm not so fluent anymore, but it looked like a good translation.

27:55.212 --> 27:56.834
There was a pilot in a vision.

27:56.854 --> 28:06.283
I mean, within a block and a half of the Majestic Hotel where I stayed, I found a combination pirate book operation, bookstore, and ice cream shop.

28:06.823 --> 28:12.889
And there was an ice cream shop as well.

28:13.229 --> 28:16.933
And I met my local pirate.

28:17.673 --> 28:21.737
He gave me some free ice cream and a free copy of my book.

28:22.238 --> 28:23.399
Yeah.

28:24.020 --> 28:25.762
But it was really well done.

28:25.822 --> 28:27.884
It was done in the... Nice.

28:27.904 --> 28:34.851
When you were in Vietnam, when you were working as a translator, and you came home, where did the writing start?

28:34.911 --> 28:37.734
Let's get a little biographical.

28:37.814 --> 28:40.697
Before I went to Vietnam, I was a playwright.

28:41.438 --> 28:43.100
I got a master's degree in playwriting.

28:43.120 --> 28:44.361
And what did I do?

28:44.381 --> 28:45.282
I was a terrible playwright.

28:45.302 --> 28:46.043
You never see what I want.

28:47.204 --> 28:52.009
No, it was in the theater department, actually.

28:52.029 --> 28:58.336
And then Vietnam turned me into fiction writers, or made me realize that I'd been a fiction writer all along.

29:00.459 --> 29:09.969
And so I came home in the 70s, early 72, and began writing fiction.

29:12.752 --> 29:15.355
Did a lot of bad stuff, teaching myself how to write.

29:16.550 --> 29:20.193
and finally started publishing in 1981, publishing books.

29:20.213 --> 29:23.696
I mean, is it true that the first novel was rejected?

29:24.537 --> 29:30.142
Twenty-one times, yeah.

29:30.162 --> 29:31.123
Twenty-one times, yeah.

29:32.144 --> 29:36.468
By the way, all six of the back of those books are now back in print.

29:36.488 --> 29:37.229
I think all of them.

29:37.249 --> 29:38.810
All of the paperbacks, yeah.

29:38.830 --> 29:39.951
They did a beautiful job.

29:40.832 --> 29:42.093
Can you smell the flowers?

29:42.113 --> 29:43.414
Yeah, they are.

29:43.434 --> 29:45.196
It looks like a string.

29:45.216 --> 29:46.557
Yeah, really.

29:47.465 --> 29:53.854
Henry Holt's a wonderful publisher.

29:54.135 --> 29:55.477
A wonderful publisher.

29:55.657 --> 29:58.040
My story is I was orphaned.

29:58.121 --> 30:00.244
I was under contract to rent a house.

30:00.544 --> 30:01.445
Oh, were you?

30:01.465 --> 30:03.048
Was that book?

30:03.228 --> 30:12.081
I know Ellen Goodman once said when I interviewed her that winning a full of supplies meant one thing for sure is that now she knows how an obituary is going to start.

30:12.161 --> 30:13.523
Yeah, right, right.

30:13.790 --> 30:18.616
The fourth through the eight words of the obituary already written, thank you.

30:18.636 --> 30:38.241
But I guess in a larger sense, does it place on your shoulders any degree of responsibility or to make you feel or... My responsibility has always been to the work and to my vision, and I have always been the most demanding of taskmen in that regard.

30:39.222 --> 30:43.307
So in that respect, what it has done for me, blessed

30:44.063 --> 30:46.225
It has found my readership.

30:46.406 --> 30:54.535
I've always thought that my books were not only serious literature, but also extremely readable.

30:55.796 --> 31:01.783
And it's always puzzled me why I have not broken through to some larger readership.

31:01.863 --> 31:08.371
And the Pulitzer has simply made people who I've always had confidence in.

31:08.591 --> 31:11.134
Confidence has been rewarded.

31:11.722 --> 31:16.229
who simply picked up my book and read it, which would like my books.

31:16.430 --> 31:19.635
I've had a kind of a cult following for some years.

31:19.655 --> 31:20.516
You were waiting to meet.

31:20.817 --> 31:22.039
Yeah.

31:22.539 --> 31:23.841
That's right.

31:23.882 --> 31:27.648
That's right.

31:27.688 --> 31:29.230
That's right.

31:29.931 --> 31:35.721
My readership and I have finally come around the corner on the same street corner at the same time.

31:35.781 --> 31:38.505
We look at each other, we smile at each other and we say, oh,

31:38.705 --> 31:39.626
There's something here.

31:39.646 --> 31:47.138
I'm convinced that Louise earlier, she was, you know, when she won the National Book Critics Circle, that launched her whole career.

31:47.158 --> 31:53.509
I mean, when they went back and sent that book, and this, you know, I interviewed her.

31:54.230 --> 31:55.993
You know, she couldn't get her book published.

31:56.894 --> 32:00.880
Finally, then it wins the NBCC, and now she's wonderful.

32:00.940 --> 32:04.085
I've interviewed her after that.

32:04.105 --> 32:06.349
I really go for these classy books.

32:07.578 --> 32:13.928
Yeah, I thought when you asked about computers, I thought my little... I bought a gateway handbook.

32:14.609 --> 32:15.069
Do you like it?

32:15.550 --> 32:16.311
It's fabulous.

32:16.371 --> 32:17.854
Two and three-quarter pounds.

32:19.035 --> 32:20.357
Full-size keyboard.

32:20.377 --> 32:20.538
Wow.

32:20.798 --> 32:23.682
What's the... 40 megabyte hard drive.

32:25.325 --> 32:32.716
And I've got a little external, again, light, external floppy drive, so I can take that or not take it, you know, or it's easy to transfer stuff.

32:33.417 --> 32:34.539
Anyway, I've been carrying that around.

32:34.579 --> 32:35.340
I've been working on...

32:35.624 --> 32:38.048
Tray tables and airplanes and hotel rooms.

32:38.268 --> 32:39.631
How long does it keep in charge?

32:40.833 --> 32:43.116
I can't pardon me for going out for this thing.

32:43.136 --> 32:44.218
About two hours.

32:44.459 --> 32:46.923
About two hours.

32:48.365 --> 32:51.951
So it's wonderful.

32:51.971 --> 32:54.736
Anyway, I've been working in Saigon.

32:54.776 --> 33:02.188
I was on the fifth floor of the Majestic Hotel, looking at over the Saigon River, writing a screenplay.

33:02.928 --> 33:11.016
Hollerstone's production company, Ixtlan, has optioned a book, and they hired me to write a screenplay.

33:11.036 --> 33:11.476
That's great.

33:12.077 --> 33:14.839
What do they do to start production?

33:14.859 --> 33:15.380
Hard to say.

33:17.242 --> 33:22.487
Screenplays do the middle of March, the first draft, and then the second draft will be due a couple of months after that or whatever.

33:22.667 --> 33:27.872
This is where the background in drama, I think, is invaluable.

33:28.712 --> 33:32.496
And according to publishers weekly, I can't tell you this, but they can.

33:33.117 --> 33:35.625
Wayne Wayne, who's going to direct.

33:36.226 --> 33:37.771
He's the guy that's... I saw that at some point.

33:37.791 --> 33:38.493
Joy Luck Club.

33:38.533 --> 33:41.161
Yeah.

33:41.402 --> 33:42.425
Probably so.

33:43.027 --> 33:43.127
Yeah.
