00:02.596 --> 00:07.822
Testing, one, two, three, four, Lawn Club, Lawn Club, Yale, 21 September, 05.

00:08.103 --> 00:13.649
Talking here with Linda Klein.

00:13.750 --> 00:21.399
Are you, I see here that your title is Intellectual Property and Contracts Manager Counsel?

00:21.759 --> 00:22.961
Yes, I'm a lawyer.

00:22.981 --> 00:32.232
You're a lawyer for the press and also for... Yeah, it's a little bit touchy because the university lawyers, the general counsel's office, are...

00:32.482 --> 00:36.654
ostensibly the lawyers for the whole university.

00:36.694 --> 00:38.520
I'm terribly sorry to interrupt.

00:38.540 --> 00:40.185
I have David on the phone.

00:40.205 --> 00:41.790
So sorry, we forgot.

00:41.810 --> 00:43.836
Can you take me to lunch at 1 o'clock?

00:43.856 --> 00:44.277
Sure.

00:44.317 --> 00:46.002
Will you just tell Sarah that

00:46.589 --> 00:47.510
She's arrived.

00:47.590 --> 00:48.851
Oh, Sarah Clark.

00:48.871 --> 00:52.554
Then I think we'll reschedule her for another time.

00:52.574 --> 00:52.734
Sure.

00:55.357 --> 00:56.498
Where I was.

00:56.518 --> 00:57.759
The university has other lawyers.

00:57.779 --> 00:58.339
Oh, yes, yes.

00:58.360 --> 01:01.002
I am listening.

01:01.022 --> 01:01.783
I'm impressed.

01:01.803 --> 01:02.443
I guess I wasn't.

01:03.124 --> 01:07.768
And they are the lawyers for the whole university.

01:08.328 --> 01:15.735
But there are a lot of us who are people on staff who are lawyers who mess with them and work with them.

01:16.407 --> 01:18.311
in many, many respects.

01:18.331 --> 01:19.513
And how long have you been with the Press?

01:19.914 --> 01:20.835
I've been here for ten years.

01:20.896 --> 01:21.396
Ten years?

01:21.417 --> 01:22.759
It was ten years in July.

01:22.779 --> 01:24.703
So ten years being 1995?

01:24.783 --> 01:26.606
Yeah.

01:26.626 --> 01:32.958
And did you come to this assignment with a publishing background at all?

01:33.219 --> 01:35.543
I had only the slightest publishing background.

01:35.684 --> 01:39.090
I had worked for a publisher right out of college for a while.

01:39.627 --> 01:54.126
Bunting and Lyon, a very small family publishing company, and I was, in effect, an editorial assistant, but sort of, since it was so small, I kind of did a lot of things, including some writing, and I got the publishing bug.

01:54.546 --> 01:55.447
Oh, really?

01:55.467 --> 01:57.610
But, and then I did a lot of other things.

01:57.650 --> 02:04.880
I went to law school, I was a faculty wife here for many years, and raised a child, and then I came here.

02:04.900 --> 02:08.284
So, tell me a little bit, what?

02:08.652 --> 02:17.563
about your role with the press and talking about intellectual property and how that's changing with electronic considerations?

02:17.603 --> 02:25.433
Well, that's all complicated, and it's changing every day from my perspective, which keeps it interesting.

02:25.573 --> 02:36.347
The laws being written as we speak and as people experience things, our biggest new challenges, I guess, are from

02:36.850 --> 03:00.867
various organizations that want to use content and publishers' content, but they particularly want the content from publishers such as the University Press Publishers who have this sort of cutting-edge research in published form, such as Google, such as Amazon.com.

03:01.287 --> 03:03.651
They want to put our books online.

03:04.019 --> 03:10.086
And it's been an evolution as we decide, what does this mean for us?

03:10.246 --> 03:11.347
How is this going to work?

03:11.387 --> 03:15.212
Are people going to just go online and read our books and we won't sell them anymore?

03:15.252 --> 03:17.174
Will people stop buying books?

03:17.975 --> 03:19.997
And that's all, it's all evolving.

03:20.057 --> 03:28.407
As a person who makes it living, as a writer, I'm quite alert to this whole, I'm sure that the contracts

03:29.213 --> 03:30.716
for Yale.

03:30.736 --> 03:33.381
University presses are basically the same kinds of contracts.

03:33.421 --> 03:34.964
Say, I signed with HarperCollins.

03:36.307 --> 03:39.152
I'm the copyright holder of my book.

03:39.734 --> 03:45.605
I own the copyright, but of course, the publisher holds it.

03:45.625 --> 03:49.753
You grant those to us in the contract, and we try to get

03:49.936 --> 03:53.860
you know, as broad a spectrum of rights from an author as we think we can use.

03:53.880 --> 03:57.723
And that means for now, but also down the line.

03:57.883 --> 04:02.528
So we have been trying to acquire electronic rights as we go along.

04:02.548 --> 04:10.515
And the agents we've been dealing with, five years ago, they said, oh, no, we are not giving you any electronic rights.

04:10.535 --> 04:14.799
And now, you know, they don't, people aren't going to buy e-books.

04:14.819 --> 04:17.882
And so the agents don't have a reason to hold on to them.

04:17.902 --> 04:19.403
My concern is...

04:19.703 --> 04:23.529
All my books are still in print, so that's not an issue.

04:23.549 --> 04:28.416
My first book was published in 1995, and it's still very well in paperback.

04:30.158 --> 04:41.434
However, the definition of in print, of course, determines how long a publisher has the rights to print the book, to produce the book.

04:41.454 --> 04:42.936
And what is in print?

04:42.996 --> 04:48.424
So I think there is a change in definition or perception of what in print means.

04:48.725 --> 04:49.626
Absolutely.

04:49.893 --> 04:53.599
You know, if somebody calls and wants to cover your book, and you can push a button and produce one.

04:53.900 --> 04:54.080
Right.

04:54.922 --> 04:57.727
So we don't want to declare our books out of print anymore.

04:57.747 --> 04:58.388
And all of them.

04:58.408 --> 04:58.989
Of course, the author.

04:59.049 --> 05:04.699
I would love to get my first book back from Holtz, because I went backwards now, and I've done three books with them.

05:04.719 --> 05:05.621
You'd reissue it?

05:06.382 --> 05:13.875
I would, because it's my first book, because it's been through 16 printings, and it has 10

05:14.615 --> 05:18.139
No, it's interesting.

05:18.239 --> 05:22.103
But my book was ten years old this August, and I wanted to do a tenth.

05:22.723 --> 05:30.211
It became a little kind of, in the world of the bibliophile and bibliomaniac, there's a book called The Gentle Madness.

05:30.231 --> 05:35.437
It did kind of become, I don't know if I may say, a minor classic of a deal.

05:35.457 --> 05:36.338
Go right ahead.

05:36.358 --> 05:43.305
And I mean, even that phrase that I used for the title, The Gentle Madness, has kind of become a synonym for

05:43.775 --> 05:54.044
And I did a lot of contemporary stories, which, especially my book Thief, who stole $20 million worth of books.

05:54.184 --> 05:58.928
And I just did a court TV thing on him last week, in fact, in producing.

05:59.588 --> 06:02.331
Well, we don't need to hear that.

06:02.351 --> 06:09.917
I'll listen to myself expounding, if you don't mind, talking about this stuff.

06:09.937 --> 06:13.140
So I thought there might be a market for a 10th anniversary edition of this book.

06:13.610 --> 06:14.712
And there probably is.

06:14.732 --> 06:15.293
Oh, I know there is.

06:15.353 --> 06:23.948
I mean, there's 100,000 copies of the first one that are printed, and people collect it for first editions, and they'll go for $200, $250, whatever.

06:23.968 --> 06:29.158
You could Google it right now, and there were only $5,800 in the first printing, and they sold out.

06:29.378 --> 06:31.101
We had three printings in the first month.

06:31.121 --> 06:32.604
Oh, wow.

06:32.624 --> 06:37.272
Yeah, well, they were small printings, as I like to point out, you know, $5,800, $2,500, and

06:37.775 --> 06:41.220
There was, I think the third one was a pretty good size.

06:41.260 --> 06:44.084
There were eight hardcover editions, and they were true editions.

06:44.164 --> 06:47.729
I did textural changes.

06:47.769 --> 06:53.096
The difference between a printing and an edition, as you know, is if you go in and change the types.

06:53.116 --> 07:00.286
But I thought a nice tenth anniversary of what happened to the book thief, what happened to this guy, and it was a big 638.

07:00.907 --> 07:06.094
And Holt said, yeah, it would do fine, but it's doing fine just now the way it is.

07:06.412 --> 07:07.953
Not just lazy.

07:07.973 --> 07:10.816
They didn't even have to pay me, obviously.

07:10.836 --> 07:16.901
I'm just curious, if I may, did they pay you for each edition as you added new material?

07:16.941 --> 07:17.081
No.

07:17.201 --> 07:20.204
There was stuff that I wanted to fix.

07:20.224 --> 07:21.905
There were more than me.

07:23.147 --> 07:23.887
I didn't know.

07:23.927 --> 07:29.872
No, in fact, this is a book that was really kind of an interesting story in publishing.

07:30.093 --> 07:36.418
I was originally under contract to Random House, and I became orphaned by Edgar and left it once someplace else.

07:36.888 --> 07:44.876
And then I went on to be an author with Joe Fox, who was a big editor at Random House.

07:44.896 --> 07:48.020
And then I kind of flushed out that old Joni Evans thing.

07:48.040 --> 07:52.144
You remember when she was fired and the contract that she signed?

07:52.164 --> 07:53.065
I was just tossed out.

07:53.105 --> 07:57.930
And for 13 months, I couldn't find a publisher for that book because it was a big, big book.

07:57.950 --> 08:03.836
And there was this perception that once they terminated it, that there was something wrong with it.

08:03.996 --> 08:06.439
And finally, this guy from Hope, the young man,

08:07.027 --> 08:09.010
who had reviewed books for me years ago.

08:09.030 --> 08:12.455
A Harvard student, you know, took a chance on it.

08:12.475 --> 08:13.857
They gave me $15,000.

08:14.278 --> 08:18.344
You know, this is a book I spent eight years writing, but they could have had it for nothing.

08:19.526 --> 08:26.977
And, you know, it goes on to be a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award, get fabulous reviews.

08:27.858 --> 08:31.363
You know, it's been counting hardcover

08:31.681 --> 08:33.283
paperback that's been 20 printings.

08:33.303 --> 08:39.530
It's just one of those great stories where it shows that the New York publishers really don't know as much as they think they know.

08:41.172 --> 08:44.576
Who cares about it, don't come out.

08:44.616 --> 08:46.639
Bibliophiles, I would think, are the one.

08:46.659 --> 08:49.562
But they do get credit for taking a chance on the New York course.

08:49.582 --> 08:51.004
And they published it beautifully.

08:51.024 --> 08:52.065
The Hope finally did.

08:52.285 --> 08:54.168
They published it, and they published it.

08:54.348 --> 08:56.230
They didn't just publish it, they published it.

08:56.250 --> 08:57.992
Once they read it in the house,

08:58.158 --> 08:59.219
They loved it.

08:59.560 --> 09:00.120
They really did.

09:00.140 --> 09:05.366
So if I were on staff at Holt, I'd be arguing with you about letting you have it back.

09:05.947 --> 09:07.088
Oh, I haven't pushed it.

09:07.108 --> 09:07.608
No, I haven't.

09:07.748 --> 09:10.411
I would like, no, I haven't even asked my agent.

09:10.431 --> 09:15.917
But you should make them, you know, a big proposal for the 10th.

09:16.198 --> 09:16.658
It's gone.

09:16.778 --> 09:18.100
The 10th is here and gone.

09:18.140 --> 09:19.181
The 10th is last month.

09:19.201 --> 09:20.002
Call it the 10th.

09:20.022 --> 09:21.764
Call it the 10th next year.

09:21.864 --> 09:27.490
I have a book coming out in November from Harper, so I'm more focused on that right now and how that

09:28.043 --> 09:31.206
comes out, this is something I was thinking about a year ago.

09:31.766 --> 09:36.351
And another thing they did, and then we'll quit, if you don't mind.

09:36.371 --> 09:38.673
A lawyer's a preferred person to talk about this.

09:39.974 --> 09:43.998
And then everybody left at Hope, by the way.

09:44.038 --> 09:51.224
My editor left, and the editor, once they get brought out by this German firm, I mean, it just went to hell.

09:52.726 --> 09:54.427
Bertelsmann.

09:54.507 --> 09:55.108
Bertelsmann.

09:55.128 --> 09:57.510
And then Michael Norman came in and this kind of

09:58.250 --> 10:11.144
The place hemorrhaged money, and it just became a lousy place to be, at which point then I was orphaned twice there, and then I left to go to Harper's, where I've been happily for the last three books.

10:12.926 --> 10:22.096
So I think I'd like to have all my books in one place, where they could publish them in uniform, kind of, they could promote them better.

10:22.757 --> 10:25.020
And then they've really got a very cheap paperback.

10:25.180 --> 10:28.003
The first paperback that came out was lovely.

10:28.085 --> 10:36.539
I mean, the hardcover was a $35 book, and they made a fortune on that book, because they only expected to sell 5,000.

10:36.599 --> 10:39.043
They wound up selling 40,000 copies of them.

10:39.063 --> 10:42.749
Please, 35 bucks every time they sold, they're making a fortune on it.

10:42.769 --> 10:43.691
I did fine, too.

10:44.011 --> 10:45.013
I'm not kidding.

10:45.382 --> 10:45.903
I'm sorry?

10:45.923 --> 10:47.185
You have a list of royalties.

10:47.205 --> 10:48.007
Oh, yes, absolutely.

10:48.027 --> 10:49.249
Oh, my royalties were fine.

10:49.670 --> 10:50.511
I still did.

10:50.531 --> 10:51.673
I mean, I'm still getting royalties.

10:51.693 --> 10:52.094
Good.

10:52.194 --> 10:53.797
Twice a year on it, so.

10:53.817 --> 10:55.761
We all need to talk about this.

10:55.781 --> 10:59.227
Well, I'm interested because I very seldom talk about it.

10:59.267 --> 11:00.389
I think we'll go back on again.

11:00.990 --> 11:02.513
You know, I think that was running the whole time.

11:02.653 --> 11:06.560
I'm going to kill myself when I start listening to this.

11:06.580 --> 11:07.261
Fast forward.

11:09.225 --> 11:09.786
Tell me...

11:10.373 --> 11:14.377
You are of publishing, but you're not of publishing.

11:14.638 --> 11:15.819
Is that a fair assessment?

11:15.919 --> 11:19.463
I mean, you're in publishing, but... Well, I'm not a publisher.

11:19.523 --> 11:22.066
I don't have the publishers.

11:22.386 --> 11:25.509
Do you have an interesting vantage point, don't you think?

11:25.529 --> 11:26.991
Well, yeah, I suppose so.

11:27.091 --> 11:32.577
I work with the acquiring editors, and they tell me what it is they're doing.

11:33.298 --> 11:40.245
I mean, we have templates and all of that, and a lot of our contracts are simple enough, but fewer and fewer of them.

11:40.276 --> 11:50.048
And then I help them decide and structure the agreement in a way that works best for our management goals and the press goals.

11:50.408 --> 11:55.515
Now, do you have many books that have to be read, vetted for a possible rival, and that doesn't happen yet?

11:55.535 --> 11:56.636
Surprisingly, not many.

11:57.397 --> 11:58.538
Surprisingly, not many.

11:58.578 --> 12:04.866
I mean, our authors are, of course, bound contractually to warrant, again,

12:05.116 --> 12:07.799
you know, all sorts of content that shouldn't be there.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.462
That still doesn't protect you in a suit, though.

12:10.482 --> 12:15.968
Well, we have a good insurance policy, too, through Yale, thank goodness.

12:16.288 --> 12:20.713
And I had a guy who was going to come after me for $16 million in that first book.

12:20.733 --> 12:23.536
Of course, it helped that I was right, you know.

12:23.556 --> 12:25.619
Yeah, it always helped to be right.

12:25.639 --> 12:27.621
But it doesn't protect you from an interest.

12:27.641 --> 12:30.084
But I still waited for the Statue of Limitations to come up.

12:30.104 --> 12:32.006
You know, they were just two years in New York.

12:33.127 --> 12:33.267
Uh-huh.

12:33.567 --> 12:34.968
That's a whole other story.

12:35.008 --> 12:36.870
That was a great story.

12:36.890 --> 12:37.411
Anyway.

12:37.431 --> 12:46.459
We've been sued a few times, and before I came, actually, and, well, maybe once since then, but it wasn't anything that I had anything to do with, thank goodness.

12:48.201 --> 12:58.751
But people have infringed our copyrights, and we have libeled other people, and, I mean, that one time, really, that was a really serious gaffe.

12:59.011 --> 13:00.232
Yale has libeled people?

13:00.252 --> 13:01.753
Well, one of the books we published.

13:01.793 --> 13:02.494
Really?

13:02.710 --> 13:03.851
Can you tell me about that?

13:03.931 --> 13:11.660
Well, I don't know very much about it, but I know that the author likened someone to Hitler.

13:11.740 --> 13:12.982
Who?

13:13.362 --> 13:14.063
Somebody living?

13:14.624 --> 13:15.124
Yeah.

13:15.324 --> 13:16.506
Stupid.

13:16.606 --> 13:17.086
No, no.

13:17.186 --> 13:18.087
How did that get through?

13:18.748 --> 13:25.596
I don't know, and the manuscript editor who was on the job apparently caught it.

13:25.795 --> 13:28.622
And I don't know, I've heard differing stories.

13:28.642 --> 13:32.591
I heard that she brought it to people's attention and they said, oh, it's not significant.

13:32.632 --> 13:34.797
I find that very hard to believe.

13:35.218 --> 13:43.939
But what I also heard from the management here was that she saw it and wondered about it and then just passed over it for it.

13:44.257 --> 13:48.224
And unfortunately, it was one of our London books, I think.

13:48.444 --> 13:51.329
And of course, it's easier to sue.

13:51.349 --> 13:52.531
It's easier to win in England.

13:52.671 --> 13:53.453
Oh, sure.

13:53.473 --> 13:55.376
It wasn't just a suit over the hill.

13:55.396 --> 13:56.979
They sued.

13:56.999 --> 14:03.750
The book wasn't even published in England, and the writer was some... You see, I can't take judgment in England.

14:03.790 --> 14:05.353
The book wasn't even... Wow.

14:05.873 --> 14:07.736
I don't know.

14:07.816 --> 14:13.744
How in the world could they get jurisdiction on this?

14:13.804 --> 14:16.087
It was extraordinary how they do it.

14:16.147 --> 14:16.588
I wonder.

14:16.608 --> 14:22.776
I wonder if it has to do with the online booksellers, because territories mean very little these days.

14:22.857 --> 14:24.679
I don't know.

14:24.719 --> 14:33.231
My book was a bestseller in Amsterdam, and it was a full-page review in Dutch that I couldn't read.

14:33.211 --> 14:35.733
My last book had a full page in TLS.

14:36.654 --> 14:38.817
But again, it's Amazon and Barnes and Noble.

14:38.897 --> 14:41.219
There are no borders anymore.

14:41.519 --> 14:42.600
Exactly.

14:42.680 --> 14:44.562
And your book isn't published any good?

14:44.903 --> 14:45.103
No.

14:45.223 --> 14:45.904
I'm surprised.

14:45.924 --> 14:47.025
I'm surprised, too.

14:47.045 --> 14:49.367
I mean, I would think your first book would have great.

14:49.387 --> 14:50.088
It's too big.

14:50.108 --> 14:56.354
The rap against my first couple of books was that they were scared by the size of it.

14:56.374 --> 14:58.476
But we sold Chinese and Korean editions.

14:59.013 --> 15:00.555
Well, they're not scared by work.

15:00.875 --> 15:03.017
They're not scared by work, and they don't pay much.

15:03.818 --> 15:04.739
Right.

15:05.740 --> 15:07.161
Minimal.

15:08.463 --> 15:09.023
That's true.

15:09.063 --> 15:21.256
Well, unfortunately, the man who was libeled was a British citizen, I believe, and he brought suit immediately, I guess, and he won to handle it.

15:21.276 --> 15:22.978
He won, so it went to court.

15:22.998 --> 15:24.299
Oh, yeah.

15:24.319 --> 15:27.923
Well, I think we did settle off.

15:28.257 --> 15:33.643
It was a big settlement for Yale.

15:33.663 --> 15:33.803
Yeah.

15:33.823 --> 15:39.929
I'm shocked that something like that was by editors.

15:40.770 --> 15:44.694
Do you think that Don't Worry is about manuscripts yet?

15:44.714 --> 15:48.298
Occasionally, people will, you know, an author will ask for it.

15:48.678 --> 15:53.203
Occasionally, an editor will say, I'm a little concerned about this.

15:53.223 --> 15:54.645
And I read them sometimes.

15:54.745 --> 15:57.808
I give them to the general counsel's office sometimes.

15:58.295 --> 16:02.901
And, you know, we cross our fingers because you want to be able to tell the truth.

16:02.961 --> 16:03.341
Sure.

16:04.062 --> 16:09.328
Have you noticed, I mean, this is what makes this press very interesting to me.

16:09.408 --> 16:15.716
I've written five books on book culture, and this is my first book on publishing for a second.

16:15.736 --> 16:22.945
And, you know, this wonderful university press, I think the finest, without question in the United States.

16:22.965 --> 16:24.667
Well, we modestly like to think so.

16:24.687 --> 16:25.207
It's true.

16:25.428 --> 16:27.390
I mean, and you just have that nice balance.

16:27.809 --> 16:33.216
between Richard's scholarship on the one hand and the very firm business sense on the other.

16:34.157 --> 16:37.662
There's an operation that operates in the black.

16:38.283 --> 16:41.687
And for several years, it's been extraordinary.

16:41.707 --> 16:45.031
I mean, I don't know if there are any other American presses that can make that claim.

16:45.051 --> 16:47.875
Maybe Oxford Press, which has a New York division.

16:48.836 --> 16:51.139
But they have such a huge back list of things.

16:51.159 --> 16:52.181
They have a huge back list.

16:52.201 --> 16:53.923
And they might as well be a trade house.

16:53.943 --> 16:54.484
Yeah.

16:54.504 --> 16:55.285
Well, they are.

16:55.305 --> 16:56.847
For all practical purposes, they are.

16:56.867 --> 16:57.748
Yeah, for all practical purposes.

16:58.336 --> 17:06.405
But it is amazing that Yale is able to kind of walk this fine line between the two worlds.

17:06.425 --> 17:11.832
And I wonder, have you seen, you've been here ten years, that's kind of an interesting ten years.

17:12.252 --> 17:13.153
Oh, absolutely.

17:13.173 --> 17:15.756
And I wonder what kind of changes you've seen over here.

17:15.776 --> 17:20.682
Well, library fields fell off radically during my tenure here.

17:21.363 --> 17:26.048
And those were the bread and butter for the, you know, for the,

17:27.277 --> 17:31.722
The books that nobody expects to sell well, the monographs.

17:31.782 --> 17:34.426
We expected them to sell to the library.

17:34.466 --> 17:36.628
The average person isn't going to go out and buy them.

17:36.648 --> 17:39.071
Sure, especially being as expensive as they are.

17:39.412 --> 17:41.835
And it was always an automatic sale.

17:41.895 --> 17:42.175
Exactly.

17:42.255 --> 17:45.099
About 5,000, 6,000 copies sell like that.

17:45.179 --> 17:46.520
Now, maybe if you're lucky, it's two.

17:48.283 --> 17:52.828
A lot of our books have maybe 500 to 2,000.

17:53.737 --> 18:10.781
And I was told, I don't know this for an absolute fact, but I was told that in 91 or 92, the press had 10 books, maybe, that sold more than 4,000 copies a year.

18:11.102 --> 18:11.783
Really?

18:12.644 --> 18:12.964
Yeah.

18:12.985 --> 18:13.465
Maybe 10.

18:13.485 --> 18:14.847
And what year again?

18:14.987 --> 18:15.488
91, 92.

18:15.528 --> 18:18.873
91 and 92, perhaps.

18:19.814 --> 18:20.335
Do that again?

18:20.787 --> 18:25.394
had 10 books that sold as many as 4,000 copies a year.

18:26.515 --> 18:29.079
And everything else sold fewer copies.

18:29.099 --> 18:29.239
10,000?

18:29.259 --> 18:29.360
Yeah.

18:32.945 --> 18:36.951
And so the rest fewer.

18:37.131 --> 18:38.032
No, 4,000.

18:38.052 --> 18:41.638
10 books that sold 4,000 or more.

18:42.959 --> 18:43.160
Wow.

18:43.580 --> 18:48.728
That was pretty much the rule up until that point, more or less.

18:49.028 --> 18:50.170
That's what I mean.

18:50.335 --> 18:53.099
Well, I'll check it out for this.

18:53.219 --> 18:55.202
Yeah, please do check it out.

18:55.863 --> 18:58.728
Because I'm not good with numbers.

18:59.008 --> 18:59.729
I'm a word for it.

18:59.749 --> 19:03.695
No, what I need here is the tips and directions to pursue.

19:04.977 --> 19:16.495
Well, people set to work to find books that would have more general interest, and I think we turned our focus somewhat to books that were

19:16.947 --> 19:31.420
more accessible to the reading, the educated reader, in part to support those books that needed to be published, that we still need to publish to fulfill our mission.

19:36.424 --> 19:36.865
That's great.

19:36.885 --> 19:38.146
So I wonder what it is now.

19:38.166 --> 19:40.148
How many books have worked out?

19:40.168 --> 19:40.948
People can tell you.

19:41.049 --> 19:42.410
I mean, people took the numbers.

19:42.490 --> 19:46.093
I'm curious.

19:46.512 --> 19:53.402
I mean, we sell, we publish a lot of books that sell between 5,000 and 10,000, I think.

19:53.603 --> 20:02.295
And then we've also, we've had a few just astounding successes.

20:03.036 --> 20:07.583
The biggest all-time success is Long Day's Journey Into Night.

20:08.565 --> 20:11.769
Yeah, that's going to be maybe just a whole study.

20:11.789 --> 20:13.532
Ah, that's such a fascinating...

20:13.934 --> 20:17.820
I had lunch yesterday, just coincidentally that I'm talking to you now.

20:17.840 --> 20:23.470
I had lunch yesterday with the 92-year-old lawyer for the O'Neill estate.

20:24.251 --> 20:25.393
Really?

20:25.413 --> 20:25.693
Yeah.

20:25.713 --> 20:26.795
What's that person's name?

20:26.815 --> 20:27.837
Herbert Jacoby.

20:29.339 --> 20:30.181
Is he here in New Haven?

20:30.201 --> 20:31.363
He's in New York.

20:31.383 --> 20:32.104
Jacoby?

20:32.124 --> 20:33.346
J-A-C-O-B-Y.

20:33.827 --> 20:35.009
He's a wonderful man.

20:35.750 --> 20:36.551
He's doing work, right?

20:36.692 --> 20:37.613
Oh, yes.

20:37.930 --> 20:39.913
I hope I'm half that alert.

20:39.933 --> 20:40.954
Anywhere near his age.

20:40.974 --> 20:44.379
And so does he have clear recollections of all of this?

20:44.399 --> 20:46.722
Did he represent Carlotta, or did he represent the university?

20:46.742 --> 20:51.509
He represented, originally, he represented Charlie Chaplin.

20:51.529 --> 20:51.770
Wow.

20:52.150 --> 20:53.712
Yeah.

20:53.732 --> 21:00.742
And he inherited, he never met Carlotta, but he inherited some of Carlotta's dealings, of course.

21:01.183 --> 21:07.752
But he represents the children, who are both dead now, but Shane and Una.

21:12.085 --> 21:13.729
Oh, yeah.

21:14.892 --> 21:16.797
And he'd probably be delighted to.

21:17.519 --> 21:18.762
I would guess he would.

21:18.782 --> 21:19.905
Kermit Jacoby?

21:19.925 --> 21:20.847
Jacoby, yeah.

21:20.867 --> 21:21.248
Jacoby?

21:21.609 --> 21:21.769
Yeah.

21:21.789 --> 21:22.772
And Derek Jacoby.

21:23.072 --> 21:23.634
Right, right.

21:23.694 --> 21:24.015
I know.

21:24.416 --> 21:26.341
I called him Jacoby, too, until I met him.

21:26.962 --> 21:27.343
Yeah.

21:27.728 --> 21:29.750
And I have his contact information.

21:29.770 --> 21:29.991
Do you?

21:30.191 --> 21:30.531
Yeah.

21:30.551 --> 21:33.094
But just yesterday, John Kalka went around.

21:33.114 --> 21:34.616
Would you be interested in sharing it with me?

21:34.636 --> 21:34.976
Oh, of course.

21:35.056 --> 21:36.658
Do you want to right now?

21:37.940 --> 21:40.603
Actually... Maybe how about I email you and you answer me with an email.

21:40.843 --> 21:45.709
Yes, and that's a better way because I left my papers... That's fine, and that way you'll have my email address.

21:45.729 --> 21:45.849
Good.

21:46.009 --> 21:51.275
I left my papers with Susan Sawyer, the Deputy General Counsel, who went with us.

21:51.295 --> 21:54.318
That way you can chat around to see if there's any problem with that.

21:54.339 --> 21:55.660
I don't want to... But he might...

21:56.264 --> 21:59.227
Oh, I would think he would.

21:59.327 --> 22:09.597
I just kind of like to know the dynamic that pushed this, because John Brighton was telling me that Bennett Seraph had agreed not to publish a reel.

22:09.617 --> 22:09.717
Yeah.

22:09.897 --> 22:22.690
I asked Herb about that over lunch, and we were sitting, there were four of us, and he and I were sitting this way, catecholing from each other, and his hearing is so severely impacted.

22:23.170 --> 22:24.752
And it was late in the lunch.

22:25.103 --> 22:26.725
And he didn't respond.

22:26.745 --> 22:30.890
I don't know if he was tired, if he didn't hear me, or if he didn't want to talk about it.

22:31.111 --> 22:31.852
And I couldn't tell.

22:32.773 --> 22:37.119
But, you know, my father, who just died at the age of 91, wanted to hear something.

22:37.940 --> 22:41.444
When he chose not to want to discuss something, he didn't hear it.

22:41.464 --> 22:43.927
It was a very useful device.

22:44.108 --> 22:44.428
Yes.

22:44.695 --> 22:48.982
It's a lot of things that you don't want to talk about.

22:49.002 --> 22:51.185
I don't think in Herb's case that's what was going on.

22:51.205 --> 22:54.771
I mean, he kept turning it up and turning it down, and he was struggling.

22:54.891 --> 23:00.019
We picked a quiet restaurant and sat way back in the corner, and even so.

23:00.039 --> 23:03.465
So what was, if I may ask, what was the purpose of this get-together?

23:03.485 --> 23:05.428
Was it just a professional courtesy technical thing?

23:05.448 --> 23:09.094
No, we're still trying to acquire some rights, some O'Neill rights.

23:09.114 --> 23:09.474
Really?

23:09.715 --> 23:09.815
Yeah.

23:09.855 --> 23:11.718
So there is relevance here then.

23:11.738 --> 23:11.918
Oh, yeah.

23:12.286 --> 23:13.587
What kinds of stuff?

23:13.928 --> 23:18.592
Well, to several of his plays that have been published elsewhere.

23:18.632 --> 23:23.257
And he's still around.

23:24.378 --> 23:25.599
He's still around with us.

23:25.619 --> 23:27.881
This goes back to the 1950s, isn't it, this particular story?

23:27.901 --> 23:28.382
Oh, yeah.

23:28.622 --> 23:29.002
Oh, yeah.

23:29.703 --> 23:30.884
That's a great story.

23:30.924 --> 23:32.706
He said, I've outlived all my clients.

23:33.447 --> 23:35.068
That was wonderful.

23:35.088 --> 23:38.952
He's on now to Una and Shane's children.

23:41.311 --> 23:42.132
That's great.

23:42.152 --> 23:43.694
That's terrific.

23:44.315 --> 23:48.421
So how have you seen things change, I think I asked today?

23:48.441 --> 24:00.878
You mentioned the 4,000 books, but is it largely in the direction that the press has taken it to be more competitive, shall we say, more muscular and more appealing?

24:00.899 --> 24:11.233
Well, I think we've struggled to find our niche in publishing because, you know, we're not going to be a Random House or a Norton.

24:11.720 --> 24:14.744
That's a good sound bite, by the way.

24:14.764 --> 24:16.266
Are you always looking for the good quotes?

24:17.668 --> 24:18.328
A full quote.

24:18.529 --> 24:20.812
That's a full quote, right?

24:21.332 --> 24:23.315
You can see how I think, right?

24:24.356 --> 24:25.417
Sure.

24:25.498 --> 24:26.058
Let me think.

24:26.098 --> 24:27.420
I interrupted the good quote.

24:27.440 --> 24:31.365
We've always struggled to find out if we should never be a random house in Norton.

24:31.615 --> 24:35.558
And we can't survive as the sleepy little university friends.

24:35.578 --> 24:37.540
And I don't know how the rest of them are doing it.

24:37.900 --> 24:38.921
I honestly don't.

24:38.941 --> 24:41.303
Except a lot of them are supported by their university.

24:41.323 --> 24:46.588
Right, but one would think that this university might be willing to support it.

24:46.608 --> 24:48.709
But that's not how you're laughing.

24:48.729 --> 24:49.630
Let the tape show.

24:51.132 --> 24:54.414
That observation of mine was not met with an answer, merely laughter.

24:54.855 --> 24:56.176
Please don't quote me.

24:57.497 --> 24:57.777
No, no, great.

24:58.137 --> 24:58.758
On that laughter.

24:58.778 --> 24:59.759
You're not alone on that.

25:00.459 --> 25:01.200
There's no...

25:01.383 --> 25:03.585
Everybody has the same loose minds.

25:04.667 --> 25:07.990
This press has to earn its supper.

25:08.691 --> 25:13.296
Well, that is pretty much everybody around this institution, I think.

25:13.316 --> 25:14.397
It's astounding.

25:14.817 --> 25:24.948
Somebody said to me, on a very different subject, but related to the university, the only thing that amazes me more than what the university will buy is what they won't buy.

25:26.129 --> 25:28.572
And he was talking about things, you know,

25:29.395 --> 25:30.457
support their staff.

25:31.118 --> 25:36.406
So you don't have the, as this is not for my use, but you don't have the endowment that, say, at Harvard.

25:36.446 --> 25:38.129
We have a huge endowment.

25:38.389 --> 25:40.092
We don't have the one that Harvard does.

25:40.132 --> 25:41.214
So what's the problem here?

25:41.234 --> 25:41.855
I don't understand it.

25:41.875 --> 25:42.355
You tell me.

25:42.616 --> 25:47.664
You know, I mean, you go to Harvard, you think you're at, I've never been to the business school.

25:47.684 --> 25:48.525
I went to a meeting over there.

25:48.565 --> 25:50.428
I thought I was at Disney World or something.

25:50.448 --> 25:51.550
I mean, it's amazing.

25:51.570 --> 25:51.891
Really?

25:51.911 --> 25:56.618
I was looking for the right word, but just,

25:57.053 --> 25:58.875
Whatever they want there, they can get.

25:58.895 --> 26:00.177
It's amazing.

26:00.197 --> 26:05.963
I mean, I know librarians who come from one place and go there, and it's never a question as to whether or not we can afford it.

26:07.625 --> 26:10.168
You know, let's say a rare book or something.

26:10.188 --> 26:13.132
You mean to the university library or to the business school library?

26:13.412 --> 26:15.054
The business school library being one of them.

26:15.074 --> 26:16.316
I mean, there are a hundred libraries.

26:16.616 --> 26:19.239
But I'm surprised that they're that way.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.723
I would be surprised if they're that way with all their libraries.

26:23.294 --> 26:26.499
They're marquee libraries, like the Houghton Library.

26:27.741 --> 26:36.054
If the funding is not immediately forthcoming from available funds, there are friends who are always there.

26:36.435 --> 26:37.957
Well, Yale has a ton of friends.

26:38.938 --> 26:40.621
Where are they?

26:40.641 --> 26:50.837
They're out there, and they're just, you know, the money that, well, this is all completely my opinion, but, I mean, I've been connected with Yale since I came in 69.

26:51.357 --> 26:52.338
Oh, really?

26:52.438 --> 26:54.340
And I worked in the graduate school for a while.

26:54.360 --> 26:56.041
So you've been here for a good while.

26:56.121 --> 26:58.343
I've been here in one fashion or another.

26:58.463 --> 26:59.764
I married a faculty member.

26:59.784 --> 27:07.111
Well, we were together since 1971, and we only divorced early this year.

27:07.151 --> 27:19.862
And he was on the Publications Committee for many years, so I was connected with the press in that way, and I was at the 75th anniversary celebration here.

27:20.348 --> 27:23.051
What else was I going to say about that, though?

27:23.071 --> 27:24.011
Something about the university.

27:24.031 --> 27:25.173
What about money and friends?

27:25.893 --> 27:26.974
No, my connection with him.

27:26.994 --> 27:27.435
Your connections?

27:27.455 --> 27:28.436
You've been here since.

27:28.476 --> 27:31.759
Well, I've just had a more paid relationship with the university.

27:31.959 --> 27:33.380
Oh, and he was a master.

27:33.420 --> 27:38.986
We were a college master team for half a year, too.

27:39.146 --> 27:43.510
So, we've had a lot of, you know, connection with the university in a lot of different ways.

27:44.331 --> 27:46.693
And it's a wonderful place to be.

27:47.568 --> 27:49.811
It's a horrible place to be in some ways.

27:49.831 --> 27:55.740
I mean, I've always, I've been reviewing Yale books for 30 years.

27:55.760 --> 28:02.309
I was a book review editor, and I still do freelance things, and my newspapers don't take.

28:02.329 --> 28:07.537
So I follow Yale, and I've always, I mean, the art books here are totally in a class by the way.

28:07.557 --> 28:09.860
And they just keep getting better and better.

28:09.880 --> 28:14.166
Not only are they beautiful and magnificently produced, but the content is,

28:14.686 --> 28:15.267
Yeah.

28:15.287 --> 28:16.229
Impeccable.

28:16.249 --> 28:17.311
You would have learned something.

28:17.331 --> 28:20.537
It's not just a pretty book and year after year.

28:21.239 --> 28:23.583
It's not just one, it's a half a dozen or ten each list.

28:23.603 --> 28:26.288
And you say, well, how do they do it?

28:26.308 --> 28:32.100
And of course, a lot of the success of the press, I think, I haven't heard the phrase Cash Powell used.

28:32.200 --> 28:37.470
I don't like it myself, but it has enabled a lot of the other things that the press does.

28:37.670 --> 28:42.601
Well, those had tapered off, too, though.

28:42.621 --> 28:44.765
The art book sales had tapered off, too.

28:44.926 --> 28:54.025
And we have new oomph there with our wonderful art editor, Patricia Fidler, who was just our best acquisition for a long time, I think.

28:54.292 --> 28:55.293
a few years ago.

28:55.313 --> 28:56.956
No, she's in the UK or she's here?

28:56.976 --> 28:57.757
No, she's here.

28:58.037 --> 29:04.367
I mean, we have some wonderful people in the UK acquiring an art, too, but Patricia is... How do you spell her last name?

29:04.387 --> 29:05.528
F-I-D-L-E-R.

29:06.049 --> 29:07.872
And we wooed her away from Princeton.

29:08.693 --> 29:11.297
I've heard about her.

29:11.317 --> 29:14.922
And she's a ten-person dynamo all wrapped up into one.

29:17.486 --> 29:20.350
I know one thing I was saying a little while ago.

29:20.390 --> 29:22.273
You asked how things have changed.

29:22.658 --> 29:30.932
have had only a few really huge commercial successes, but they have helped carry us over.

29:31.313 --> 29:33.156
And one was The Long Day's Journey.

29:33.657 --> 29:34.879
That's 50 years ago.

29:34.899 --> 29:39.046
It's still selling wonderfully well.

29:39.587 --> 29:47.620
John Culka brought it out again in a new edition a couple years ago, and it's, you know, got a whole new life, but it's a great jacket, great jacket.

29:48.427 --> 29:53.491
Didn't the Library of America do all of the audio's play?

29:53.511 --> 29:53.652
Yeah.

29:53.752 --> 29:59.096
So, is that edition used there, and the Library of America edition won't it?

29:59.116 --> 30:00.237
I think they have their own.

30:00.257 --> 30:00.818
The text?

30:00.898 --> 30:02.800
Well, the text, yes, I'm sure.

30:03.160 --> 30:06.323
The text must come from here, so they have to negotiate.

30:06.343 --> 30:06.703
They did.

30:07.203 --> 30:08.084
They did, years ago.

30:08.204 --> 30:09.966
I mean, there's an old contract.

30:10.086 --> 30:12.949
Yeah, there's an old contract with them.

30:13.329 --> 30:16.932
But, no, I mean, we just brought out a new paperback a few years ago.

30:17.232 --> 30:21.657
fabulous new jacket done by my dear friend in book design upstairs.

30:21.797 --> 30:25.061
And if you haven't seen it, you should.

30:25.141 --> 30:27.804
It's got a whiskey glass on the front there.

30:27.904 --> 30:28.425
Really?

30:28.445 --> 30:30.127
It's just so perfect.

30:30.147 --> 30:31.088
I wonder what that sells.

30:31.348 --> 30:34.031
That's still pretty... Well, I could tell you.

30:34.051 --> 30:35.553
Just be curious.

30:35.573 --> 30:40.358
I'm going to take a couple pictures of you, too, if you don't mind.

30:41.320 --> 30:43.602
And then we had the success with the Taliban.

30:43.762 --> 30:46.125
I'm sure you heard about that.

30:46.831 --> 30:51.559
John told me about that, but that's the next picture.

30:51.579 --> 30:53.302
That was a big surprise.

30:53.322 --> 30:57.970
Well, that was, you know, one of those things where you're just lucky to be where you are.

30:57.991 --> 30:58.852
Yeah.

30:58.872 --> 31:05.484
Well, our history and religion editor, Chuck Grinch, bought that from a U.K.

31:05.944 --> 31:08.569
publisher for it.

31:11.941 --> 31:15.186
Yeah, but when that whole Taliban thing breaks... And then, you know, they hit the building.

31:15.206 --> 31:16.768
This is the only credible book out there, right?

31:17.129 --> 31:20.654
They hit the building, and... Well, was that the Taliban?

31:20.674 --> 31:21.416
Not the Taliban.

31:21.776 --> 31:25.482
When they hit the buildings, that was Al-Qaeda.

31:25.502 --> 31:27.445
Was it an Al-Qaeda book or a Taliban book?

31:27.645 --> 31:31.952
It was a Taliban book, but people became interested in it because of that.

31:31.972 --> 31:34.175
That's right, because the Taliban was hiding Al-Qaeda.

31:34.195 --> 31:35.417
That's exactly right.

31:43.025 --> 32:07.547
The problem is it's divided into four entries here because we've had two cross-band and two paper-band editions.

32:07.949 --> 32:13.539
And so if I'm going to tally these up, I have to open every single one of these.

32:13.559 --> 32:25.139
No, but just like, you know, one number.

32:25.159 --> 32:27.022
American Eros, not like that.

32:28.725 --> 32:30.168
It looks like pink slips.

32:30.188 --> 32:32.352
That's very good, too.

32:32.372 --> 32:32.472
Yeah.

32:38.577 --> 32:40.539
Don't worry about it.

32:41.580 --> 32:43.622
If it was immediately available.

32:43.662 --> 32:44.623
I'll find this out.

32:47.846 --> 32:48.567
One more.

32:49.808 --> 32:50.629
It's very interesting.

32:50.649 --> 33:00.499
Why wouldn't they have our biggest book sales in here?

33:00.519 --> 33:00.899
That's fascinating.

33:00.919 --> 33:03.301
They're not in there.

33:03.321 --> 33:07.065
The accounting department can tell you, but I know as of

33:07.433 --> 33:09.095
four years ago or something like that.

33:09.115 --> 33:15.024
It was 1.3 million already, I think, or something like that, which for us is huge.

33:15.865 --> 33:18.289
And that's not your greatest selling book of all time, by the way.

33:18.369 --> 33:18.829
Yes, it is.

33:19.530 --> 33:20.412
I don't think so.

33:20.612 --> 33:21.153
Well, what is?

33:21.654 --> 33:22.395
You'd be amazed.

33:22.735 --> 33:25.199
It's very early artists.

33:26.821 --> 33:27.802
You're not going to believe this.

33:30.727 --> 33:30.967
Go back.

33:31.007 --> 33:35.854
I'm going to shut this off.

33:37.690 --> 33:43.977
sold, let's see, in New Haven, $74,150.

33:44.818 --> 33:47.121
And that was one year?

33:48.462 --> 33:49.583
No, that's since 2002.

33:50.144 --> 33:51.125
Since 2002?

33:51.145 --> 33:52.927
Yeah, it came out in 2002.

33:54.169 --> 33:55.370
I don't have the pub date here.

33:57.132 --> 34:02.838
But that has earned almost half a million dollars, Joe, just that idea.

34:02.858 --> 34:02.938
Wow.

34:04.340 --> 34:06.162
And that's only that one.

34:06.817 --> 34:13.225
No wonder the family still has an attorney monitoring this thing.

34:13.245 --> 34:23.838
Well, let's see what his cloth-bound sold is since the 1950 edition.

34:23.858 --> 34:27.263
That's when it first came out.

34:27.283 --> 34:28.004
This is the world's lowest database.

34:28.024 --> 34:28.484
Tragic-crazy, isn't it?

34:28.504 --> 34:36.334
And then the first cloth-bound, it looks like, oh,

34:36.770 --> 34:38.593
That hardly seems possible.

34:39.414 --> 34:40.175
Under 2000?

34:40.435 --> 34:43.119
No, it can't be.

34:43.339 --> 34:47.906
But that may have been only short live edition, and then they brought out the next one.

34:47.926 --> 34:50.069
That's what's hard to tell from there.

34:50.089 --> 34:55.597
I mean, that book on a Pulitzer, it was almost an instantaneous success, I think, wasn't it?

34:55.677 --> 34:57.459
Oh, yeah, I think so.

34:57.479 --> 34:59.342
And they produced it, and it just did everything.

34:59.963 --> 35:03.047
I would love to know the inside story to that.

35:04.597 --> 35:06.700
Now, let me see.

35:06.740 --> 35:17.633
Here's the... Here's the 1962 edition, and that sold 230-some thousand units.

35:17.653 --> 35:17.893
Jeez.

35:20.536 --> 35:25.762
And that's been OP since God knows when.

35:25.782 --> 35:25.882
Ages.

35:25.902 --> 35:25.983
Wow.

35:26.003 --> 35:26.103
Ages.

35:26.764 --> 35:28.586
So what I need is a complete window.

35:28.926 --> 35:33.051
Oh, I was going to say I'd love to know how it happens.

35:33.588 --> 35:37.433
that Carlotta went to Bennett Cerf and said, give that to me.

35:37.473 --> 35:49.728
There's a young woman who's doing some work with Janice, and I've told her, this is what I really want her, just look at whatever correspondence that they have over there, just kind of document.

35:49.748 --> 35:50.429
In the archives.

35:50.629 --> 35:51.671
In the archives.

35:51.811 --> 35:52.251
Yeah.

35:52.271 --> 35:55.435
Oh, Chester Kerr's stuff would be fascinating, I'm sure.

35:55.455 --> 35:57.378
What a character.

35:57.398 --> 35:57.878
Oh, gosh.

35:57.898 --> 36:02.304
And after I've done my, the number I've set for myself is 20 interviews.

36:03.185 --> 36:03.325
Mm-hmm.

36:03.794 --> 36:22.697
But when I've done my 20th, then I'm just going to start listening to it, but really now, then I'm going to start coming down and going through the archives and actually start kind of writing in a very perceptual way, but then really going in to get precisely the kinds of things we're talking about, you know, the Chester.

36:24.230 --> 36:26.874
Because he would have been the one that handled those.

36:27.235 --> 36:29.258
He's the one she brought it to.

36:29.278 --> 36:32.363
Yeah, and those are the days when people actually wrote letters.

36:32.383 --> 36:34.907
Oh, he's got fabulous letters.

36:34.927 --> 36:35.928
He's got fabulous letters.

36:37.130 --> 36:40.616
I've read some of them, and the letters between him and Bennett serve.

36:41.177 --> 36:44.402
I mean, I don't think they ever ... It's a wonder they didn't burn up.

36:46.385 --> 36:48.108
So ... Really?

36:48.408 --> 36:51.553
Those are all over in that Beinecke of Sterling thing.

36:52.006 --> 36:53.928
They've given me a letter I have access to.

36:53.948 --> 37:01.896
Yeah, I think they're all in sterling in manuscripts and archives, but there are even a few in the files here which are actively scanning.

37:02.336 --> 37:04.698
No, I think some of them are original.

37:04.758 --> 37:08.062
Here, scanning them just for archival purposes?

37:08.082 --> 37:15.049
This young woman out here is scanning all of our contracts, and she's scanning whatever correspondence is in the files.

37:15.729 --> 37:21.675
And there's not a lot of correspondence in the standard contract files, but in our series and in some of these

37:22.178 --> 37:24.141
big publications filed.

37:24.161 --> 37:30.371
So that would be an interesting little thing, that the correspondents would go as big as Serf, of course, was keeping his word to O'Neill.

37:31.993 --> 37:36.821
And Chester had no such... Chester seemed to have no problem with it.

37:36.841 --> 37:39.605
Well, I mean, but he didn't... He wasn't part of the... He wasn't part of it.

37:39.645 --> 37:40.847
Yeah.

37:40.967 --> 37:42.890
And what a great service he did.

37:42.970 --> 37:48.999
I mean, you know, when Kafka died, he ordered his friend, Max Bride, to destroy everything.

37:49.019 --> 37:50.802
You know, thankfully Max didn't.

37:51.794 --> 37:55.017
I mean, the dead really don't have that many rights.

37:55.057 --> 37:58.120
They terminate pretty well.

37:58.260 --> 38:00.863
If you want it to be destroyed, destroy it yourself.

38:00.923 --> 38:05.167
Otherwise, once you're gone, don't expect somebody else to do it for you.

38:06.488 --> 38:08.611
That would seem to be my approach to it.

38:08.631 --> 38:09.992
Thank goodness he did it.

38:10.913 --> 38:20.282
But it's a fabulous story, and I think that that would almost be a metaphor for a lot of different things.

38:20.667 --> 38:23.852
expression of the University Press going big time on the commercial.

38:26.476 --> 38:26.617
Mm-hmm.

38:26.637 --> 38:26.777
Mm-hmm.

38:26.797 --> 38:28.059
And we didn't publish fiction.

38:28.860 --> 38:30.323
And we didn't publish fiction.

38:30.864 --> 38:33.548
And in walks this play, and it's been our cash cow.

38:37.134 --> 38:38.336
Jeez, this is so good.

38:38.356 --> 38:38.496
See?

38:38.516 --> 38:40.499
This is good.

38:40.519 --> 38:44.025
But we are trying now to get rights.

38:44.343 --> 38:50.889
to a lot of things that Random House has been publishing, you know, and O'Neill things that Random House has been publishing.

38:50.909 --> 38:52.611
And that's what that was about yesterday.

38:52.631 --> 38:53.212
That's great.

38:54.593 --> 38:59.257
I mean, John's my editor on this, so nobody's going to be surprised.

38:59.277 --> 39:00.659
But I mean, that's a great quote.

39:00.679 --> 39:03.141
And we didn't publish fiction in Amlox's cash card.

39:10.108 --> 39:10.868
That's a great quote.

39:10.989 --> 39:12.510
Can you just see how beautiful that quote is?

39:15.123 --> 39:18.206
You can quote me on that one.

39:19.327 --> 39:20.388
Yeah, this is fun.

39:20.428 --> 39:23.892
People saying, you really want to do a piece of university press, you know?

39:24.272 --> 39:24.492
Oh, God.

39:24.512 --> 39:25.553
I said, this is going to be fun.

39:25.573 --> 39:28.256
The people here, I mean, they're incredible people now.

39:28.676 --> 39:33.241
And I knew some of the, you know, some of the ones from years back, too.

39:33.721 --> 39:37.485
Just the most amazingly wonderful and interesting people.

39:38.045 --> 39:45.012
Even, you know, right now, not to mention over the past hundred years, and I think that what you really have right now is a core of

39:45.194 --> 39:50.721
really terrific professionals in their own specialty areas.

39:51.461 --> 39:52.242
Fantastic.

39:52.403 --> 39:57.409
This is not a second team, say, to what you might find at Knopf.

39:57.429 --> 39:57.589
No.

39:57.609 --> 39:58.970
Oh, no, no, no.

39:59.451 --> 40:00.532
It's a different team.

40:00.572 --> 40:08.442
Very dedicated people, because we're not doing it for the large salaries.

40:08.462 --> 40:09.663
That would be.

40:09.683 --> 40:11.886
Yeah, don't put that in the book.

40:11.906 --> 40:13.648
I hope you're talking to

40:14.388 --> 40:16.170
Maureen Newman?

40:16.231 --> 40:17.032
Yeah, she is.

40:17.993 --> 40:23.260
She's a production, the head of production, well, not head of production.

40:24.422 --> 40:32.573
There is a production head, Chris Coffin, but Maureen has been handling production here for many, many years, and she's fabulous.

40:32.593 --> 40:38.381
Tons of personality, and she knows where a lot of bodies are buried.

40:38.401 --> 40:41.225
Ooh, like that, yeah.

40:41.325 --> 40:42.927
Yeah, and she doesn't put a nice

40:43.210 --> 40:43.971
face on things, either.

40:43.991 --> 40:45.934
I mean, I think she cuts right to them.

40:45.954 --> 40:51.523
So she'd be interested in seeing a... I mean, I just think she'd tell you the way she sees it.

40:51.543 --> 40:53.967
She's not going to tell you what... And she's been here for a good while?

40:54.308 --> 40:57.573
She's been here a long time.

40:57.593 --> 40:57.693
Good.

40:57.713 --> 41:01.058
And she may not be somebody who you would dig to.

41:01.078 --> 41:05.065
Well, she hasn't spiked me, because she hasn't been suggesting quite a while.

41:05.706 --> 41:10.213
Nobody else... I'm surprised, for all that they did.

41:10.666 --> 41:14.833
I'd like to go where the wild goose goes, where the stories are.

41:14.873 --> 41:15.053
Yeah.

41:15.674 --> 41:18.118
I think she's got some great stories.

41:18.378 --> 41:22.705
Another person who's been here a very long time is Larry Kenney.

41:25.470 --> 41:25.890
He is?

41:26.091 --> 41:27.333
K-E-N-N-E-Y.

41:27.513 --> 41:35.085
He's a manuscript editor who's been here for thirty years or so.

41:35.105 --> 41:36.808
I was seeing Mary at eleven.

41:37.126 --> 41:39.089
Oh, Mary and Ash.

41:39.109 --> 41:40.591
Oh, Mary and Ash.

41:40.691 --> 41:42.733
Oh, wonderful.

41:42.753 --> 41:44.135
Now, she's been here a good while, too.

41:44.155 --> 41:45.156
She's no longer here.

41:45.597 --> 41:47.800
Oh, she's no longer here.

41:47.820 --> 41:48.601
She's coming in.

41:49.062 --> 41:49.883
If it's Mary and Ash.

41:49.903 --> 41:50.664
It is Mary and Ash.

41:51.325 --> 41:54.889
Yeah, no, she was gone well before I came.

41:55.770 --> 41:58.934
I'm just thinking of people who are here who've been here for a very long time.

41:59.515 --> 42:05.163
Another one, oh, Jim Johnson.

42:05.183 --> 42:06.304
Jim Johnson.

42:06.324 --> 42:07.065
Yeah, he's a book.

42:07.298 --> 42:13.929
A book designer, and he's also been here 25 years or something.

42:13.949 --> 42:15.552
I talked to Nancy yesterday.

42:15.572 --> 42:16.954
Nancy a bit of it?

42:16.974 --> 42:17.074
Yeah.

42:17.094 --> 42:17.575
She's great.

42:17.856 --> 42:19.699
Yeah, she is.

42:19.719 --> 42:21.402
And design is very important.

42:21.542 --> 42:22.544
Oh, yeah.

42:22.564 --> 42:28.834
People, you know, there are days that the stereotypical university press book is just a boring,

42:29.455 --> 42:35.481
blue cloth book with even a dust jacket that you spend $150 more for a library and nobody ever reads it.

42:35.601 --> 42:38.565
That's not the case anymore.

42:38.585 --> 42:39.145
Right, right.

42:39.165 --> 42:44.331
Yeah, Nancy did that great Benjamin Franklin.

42:44.351 --> 42:44.831
Oh, yeah.

42:44.891 --> 42:45.692
She's right under that.

42:45.872 --> 42:46.613
I love that.

42:46.633 --> 42:47.194
Wonderful book.

42:47.214 --> 42:47.694
I love that.

42:48.315 --> 42:52.059
I'm just thinking of people who are a little bit off, you know, off there.

42:52.079 --> 42:53.320
Oh, that's good.

42:53.603 --> 43:05.523
I'll send you an email if you think of any other people that might be good for me.

43:06.664 --> 43:08.307
Marion's coming in in about 25 minutes.

43:08.327 --> 43:10.110
I have to run out and get some quarters for my

43:10.327 --> 43:13.911
I have quarters if you need some.

43:14.311 --> 43:16.774
Yeah, I keep them because my daughter takes the bus.

43:16.794 --> 43:17.835
Are you sure?

43:17.855 --> 43:18.916
Yeah, sure.

43:19.277 --> 43:20.258
Save me a trip to that.

43:20.578 --> 43:24.423
Yeah, no, somebody died, so I got in the parking lot out here.

43:24.463 --> 43:25.944
If you had $2 worth, I'd be just left.

43:25.964 --> 43:27.166
I've got them probably.

43:27.806 --> 43:29.168
That'll take me through the day.

43:29.208 --> 43:30.349
That'd be great.

43:30.489 --> 43:33.933
I don't have one left, so I think more will give me.

43:34.013 --> 43:39.439
When I took this job, I asked John Ryden how I would park.

43:40.583 --> 43:41.644
He didn't want to tell me.

43:42.465 --> 43:44.607
He said, oh, just park at the meter for now.

43:45.808 --> 43:48.611
Little did I know I'd be parking at the meter forever.

43:48.631 --> 43:48.871
No.

43:49.592 --> 43:52.335
Actually, someone, basically, someone died and I got in a lot.

43:52.375 --> 43:53.596
Oh, you're in a lot.

43:53.616 --> 43:54.097
Good for you.

43:54.117 --> 43:54.617
Thank you.

43:54.637 --> 43:56.219
This is terrific.

43:56.619 --> 43:59.602
Last time I was here, I bought a roll.

43:59.642 --> 44:05.428
I went over to the bank and I just keep the roll in the car, you know.

44:05.448 --> 44:06.389
I'm going to shut this off.

44:06.489 --> 44:07.030
I'm going to go...
