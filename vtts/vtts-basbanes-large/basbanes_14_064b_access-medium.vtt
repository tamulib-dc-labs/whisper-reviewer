WEBVTT

00:02.157 --> 00:10.648
...possible to decentralize your warehousing of the things and still have one heck of a good library that people are satisfied with.

00:10.909 --> 00:28.772
I think the challenge for us in this area, as in most areas of higher education next year, is going to be to emphasize the value that we get out of face-to-face contact with other people and hands-on contact with valuable cultural materials.

00:29.478 --> 00:42.947
Some of the things we have done in the traditional university of the last 50 or 100 years, we've done face-to-face and hands-on just because there was no alternative, just because it was as cheap as anything else, so we might as well do that.

00:43.501 --> 00:49.587
I don't think the academic lecture is a particularly efficient form of transmitting most of the kinds of education.

00:49.627 --> 00:51.089
The academic what did you say?

00:51.209 --> 00:51.649
The lecture.

00:51.830 --> 00:52.871
The standing up in front of the room.

00:52.931 --> 00:53.431
Oh, lecture.

00:53.451 --> 00:53.712
I'm sorry.

00:53.732 --> 00:54.933
I thought you said it sounded like collector.

00:55.013 --> 00:55.934
Okay, yeah.

00:55.974 --> 00:59.518
The standing up and making noise for 50 minutes doesn't seem to me to be especially effective.

00:59.538 --> 01:03.982
I think there's a lot of more interactive ways you can deal with people.

01:05.384 --> 01:09.728
We are challenged now to think, how can you put the material that you would otherwise have put in a lecture?

01:10.197 --> 01:15.284
Make that material more interactively, more constantly available to your students, even if it's a lecture.

01:16.105 --> 01:33.767
Making videos of that lecture available to them to go back to when they're studying seems to me to be a better thing than just to give the lecture and hope that three months from now they'll be able to decipher and remember enough of their own notes in order to spit something back at you.

01:33.787 --> 01:37.572
I think the physical library is a place where

01:39.239 --> 02:07.812
You go for an experience, you go for a particular kind of intellectual adventure, and I think you will physically, even if you got to a point where none of the books were in the building, I personally don't think that will ever happen, but even if you got to that point, I think you would still need a building to which to go for certain of your intellectual interactions with others and for access to concentrated forms of resources to staff who can help you.

02:08.737 --> 02:10.020
who can help you work with it.

02:10.040 --> 02:12.264
You know, the Greeks called it a museum, right?

02:12.605 --> 02:14.388
They went there to be inspired by the muses.

02:15.130 --> 02:15.611
Exactly.

02:16.132 --> 02:24.028
And there's something like that that you need to do.

02:24.565 --> 02:30.094
Another gorgeous library that I love right now, just newly built, and have you seen the Vancouver Public Library?

02:30.134 --> 02:32.058
No, no, I've heard about it, though.

02:32.078 --> 02:33.220
Oh, it's absolutely gorgeous.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.043
You walk in and your mouth just drops open.

02:35.243 --> 02:36.245
When did it open, do you know?

02:36.265 --> 02:38.048
Oh, last year or so?

02:38.068 --> 02:38.809
No, this is important.

02:38.829 --> 02:43.698
You see, I'm going to have in this new book the definitive chapter on the San Francisco Public Library story.

02:43.898 --> 02:48.666
I spent eight days out there last fall interviewing everyone, Nick Baker, the whole works.

02:48.646 --> 02:49.247
Okay.

02:49.267 --> 02:54.574
But I've heard Vancouver put up as, you know, well, this is the other way to do it.

02:55.455 --> 02:57.077
Well, I'll tell you, there's two or three things about it.

02:57.097 --> 02:58.098
It's a gorgeous building.

02:58.178 --> 03:01.423
I mean, you just smile to look at it.

03:01.443 --> 03:04.747
It's got huge expansion space built into it in an interesting way.

03:05.268 --> 03:16.122
There's a second tower kind of there, which is now occupied by state and local government offices, but which is available expansion space under the same roof if they ever need it.

03:16.810 --> 03:21.175
So it's economically feasible because it's being used as office space right now.

03:21.816 --> 03:23.177
But on the other hand, the space is there.

03:23.237 --> 03:24.859
They're not constrained by what they've done.

03:25.160 --> 03:33.429
University of British Columbia in Vancouver has just built a new library building, which is way too small for their collection and is already a crisis for the new librarian.

03:33.870 --> 03:38.034
But the other thing Vancouver Public has is it rains a lot in Vancouver.

03:38.395 --> 03:41.158
So it's got a huge atrium indoors and outdoors.

03:41.178 --> 03:41.799
Sounds great.

03:42.620 --> 03:46.564
With cafes, bookshops, gift shops.

03:47.303 --> 03:50.462
indoor-outdoor seating.

03:51.033 --> 03:55.701
When I go to Vancouver now, there's a place down there where I... So it's like Starbucks or Barnes and Noble.

03:55.761 --> 03:58.726
I mean, we have these accessories, library accessories.

03:59.527 --> 03:59.667
Yeah.

03:59.848 --> 04:03.193
The best pizza by the slice I have found in Vancouver is there.

04:03.313 --> 04:06.098
And so when I go there now, I'm not walking around.

04:06.118 --> 04:09.844
I go by there just to sit there, eat a slice of pizza, and look at the library.

04:09.864 --> 04:10.906
I'm not using the library.

04:11.106 --> 04:15.313
Yeah, but I mean, you know, the old line from the Dirty Desert, very pretty, but can they fight?

04:15.353 --> 04:17.417
You know, how's the collection there?

04:17.497 --> 04:17.597
Yeah.

04:17.577 --> 04:20.862
I do not know the collection intimately, but let's put it this way.

04:21.223 --> 04:29.757
The place is strong with people who are using it in an intensive kind of way, and it's got all kinds of positive reactions.

04:29.777 --> 04:32.601
My point is that it's a collection.

04:32.662 --> 04:33.964
It's a collection that can expand.

04:34.004 --> 04:40.294
They've got electronic resources, and what I've looked at superficially looks like they've done a good job of that, but they've also thought about it.

04:40.274 --> 04:43.360
in terms of the question of why would somebody actually come here?

04:43.420 --> 04:44.582
What would they want to do here?

04:44.662 --> 04:53.959
Let's give them quiet working space, let's give them access to materials, but let's also make sure that it's a place where the social part of the interaction can take place as well.

04:55.282 --> 04:59.810
And it seems to me that what you have is what in a way we're inventing with Barnes & Noble and Borders.

05:00.311 --> 05:01.894
Places where people go

05:02.701 --> 05:05.386
to do some of their socializing around books.

05:05.406 --> 05:09.513
So definitely it's... ...what we do as just sitting quietly reading the thing by ourselves.

05:09.733 --> 05:13.259
So, you know, this whole concept of book culture is something I'm dealing with.

05:13.359 --> 05:18.368
So really what you're seeing here is just an evolving... an evolution in book culture, apparently.

05:18.428 --> 05:18.708
Sure.

05:19.089 --> 05:24.338
And when I was a kid growing up in New Mexico and Texas, there weren't places...

05:25.162 --> 05:31.836
that validated for me the experience of going and hanging around with books and being with other people who cared about books and so forth.

05:31.856 --> 05:33.499
Kind of a dirty secret.

05:33.519 --> 05:40.012
If we'd had good borders when I was a kid, it would have meant the world to me to have a place where you could go and spend time.

05:40.032 --> 05:44.301
The little public libraries, which were small, struggling public libraries, were what I had done.

05:44.618 --> 05:46.000
what meant the world to me.

05:46.120 --> 05:53.010
But they were clearly too small, too struggling, not enough space, you know, challenged in a variety of ways.

05:53.871 --> 06:00.560
If we can make these spaces, be they bookstores or libraries, places where people really interact with each other and stuff, we're going to be that much better off.

06:01.342 --> 06:07.030
Now, could you briefly, could you email me a CV on yourself?

06:07.811 --> 06:09.413
Or is it on your website?

06:09.433 --> 06:10.334
Sure, can do.

06:10.975 --> 06:12.838
Let me do it in two different ways, sure.

06:13.118 --> 06:14.440
I'm making notes and I will.

06:15.196 --> 06:17.919
I'll send you a note in... Probably got to be a couple of hours.

06:17.939 --> 06:23.466
I've got to go... In fact, I've got to leave for Boston in half an hour, so I'm on my... I've got to be in the President's office in 10 minutes.

06:23.486 --> 06:25.669
Okay, well, that would be great.

06:25.769 --> 06:29.354
And then also, briefly, I have to say, I had to look really hard.

06:29.414 --> 06:31.897
Now I can see it perfectly, but my wife had to point it out to me.

06:31.977 --> 06:33.799
I couldn't see the lion in this.

06:33.960 --> 06:36.683
I couldn't see the lion in that one, yes.

06:36.803 --> 06:40.768
But I'm particularly fond of that painting for several reasons, so I'll use that one.

06:40.788 --> 06:43.752
As compared to some other ones in which the lion is...

06:43.917 --> 06:46.941
And then finally, I'd like to pick this up at another point.

06:48.603 --> 06:53.570
Let me go over this tape and then let me talk to my contact at the inquiry this afternoon.

06:53.630 --> 06:55.051
I'd love to do a story for her.

06:55.091 --> 06:57.615
And she does a nice job.

06:57.875 --> 07:02.221
They've done two of my stories in the last month, so I've got a good relationship there.

07:02.741 --> 07:09.150
Sometimes it's later this morning, early afternoon, and I will send you a note with several things I've made notes of, URLs and whatnot, just to do this.

07:09.170 --> 07:11.713
And then just very, very briefly,

07:11.693 --> 07:14.977
The lion, why is it that libraries always have lions?

07:14.997 --> 07:15.838
You think it's from St.

07:15.858 --> 07:16.258
Jerome?

07:17.600 --> 07:17.720
Oh.

07:21.084 --> 07:24.888
This is just, I mean, why is the lion always associated with libraries?

07:25.729 --> 07:27.331
You ask a good question.

07:27.351 --> 07:28.873
I think that is a good hypothesis.

07:28.953 --> 07:32.016
I think Jerome and libraries go together and so forth.

07:32.036 --> 07:41.447
Well, Jerome is said to be the patron saint of libraries, and if that's the case... I'll tell you the books by a man named Eugene Wright called Jerome and the Renaissance.

07:41.765 --> 07:44.929
Okay.

07:45.810 --> 07:47.772
I'm in Boston.

07:47.792 --> 07:50.015
Oh, I'll go get it today.

07:50.295 --> 07:51.757
It might begin to give you an answer.

07:52.217 --> 07:54.239
Eugene Rice, Jerome in the Renaissance.

07:55.120 --> 07:59.305
I'll be at the Boston Athenaeum in an hour, so I'll check it out.

07:59.526 --> 08:00.206
Well, you've got to run.

08:00.527 --> 08:02.028
I'd like to continue this.

08:02.629 --> 08:05.192
Do you know my book, my book, A Gentle Madness?

08:05.733 --> 08:09.477
If not, I'd be happy to show you what I'm working on.

08:09.457 --> 08:13.805
I saw it in the library, did not grab it, but I would adore a copy of it.

08:14.827 --> 08:15.909
So what's the address?

08:16.330 --> 08:16.650
Sure.

08:17.432 --> 08:18.794
Let me add the address to my email.

08:18.894 --> 08:19.976
Okay, that's the best way.

08:20.016 --> 08:20.197
Good.

08:20.718 --> 08:22.140
Okay, you've got to run, I've got to run.

08:22.321 --> 08:23.924
Let's pick this up at another time.

08:24.264 --> 08:24.585
Excellent.

08:24.605 --> 08:25.186
Great pleasure.

08:25.206 --> 08:25.767
Nice talking to you.

08:25.787 --> 08:26.368
Thanks a lot.
