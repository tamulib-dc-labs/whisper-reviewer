00:03.052 --> 00:04.053
Talking about Jimmy Breslin.

00:04.073 --> 00:06.515
You know, this is our fourth interview over the years?

00:06.575 --> 00:06.795
Yes.

00:06.815 --> 00:09.197
You don't remember, but... I remember.

00:09.398 --> 00:11.339
I remembered everything today.

00:11.840 --> 00:16.844
You tried to check it once over the phone on the Son of Sam site.

00:16.864 --> 00:18.666
I came to see you at the Ritz-Carlton.

00:18.806 --> 00:21.529
And you got the three scratches and you got this... Yeah.

00:22.209 --> 00:25.352
And then this is the fourth one.

00:25.993 --> 00:27.053
So this is the fourth one.

00:27.454 --> 00:28.415
Yeah, good.

00:28.675 --> 00:29.235
Good for us.

00:29.536 --> 00:31.017
We're still here.

00:31.418 --> 00:37.586
I saw Bill Cosby in an interview once, and he said he was over 50, and he said, well, I think I'm playing with house money.

00:38.387 --> 00:40.590
How do you, I mean, is that a fair statement?

00:41.091 --> 00:41.631
I guess.

00:41.752 --> 00:43.213
I never look at it that way.

00:43.494 --> 00:45.216
Do you want cream or sugar?

00:45.236 --> 00:45.837
Just milk.

00:45.917 --> 00:47.179
Just black, to me.

00:47.199 --> 00:48.180
You want cream or sugar?

00:48.200 --> 00:48.400
Yeah.

00:49.462 --> 00:50.363
She worries.

00:50.403 --> 00:51.304
You worry so much.

00:51.384 --> 00:54.949
Don't worry, but that's why she's so good, you know.

00:55.009 --> 00:57.272
No, I don't think anything like that.

00:57.292 --> 00:57.392
Good.

00:57.946 --> 01:01.651
I don't either, by the way.

01:02.352 --> 01:05.256
It's a good line if you want to... Every day's a blessing.

01:05.376 --> 01:06.338
Oh, come on.

01:06.698 --> 01:09.582
They say it's a beautiful day today.

01:09.722 --> 01:14.429
I never cared from early on whether it was raining, snowing, heat.

01:14.529 --> 01:15.991
It's a day.

01:16.011 --> 01:18.174
It gives you a shot at life, another chance.

01:18.875 --> 01:19.075
It's good.

01:19.095 --> 01:19.616
I don't care.

01:19.796 --> 01:20.577
You look wonderful.

01:20.797 --> 01:21.418
I'm all right.

01:21.639 --> 01:23.361
I'm not drinking.

01:23.381 --> 01:24.643
I'm not drinking.

01:24.663 --> 01:25.444
I don't smoke.

01:26.666 --> 01:27.767
I...

01:28.625 --> 01:31.050
I live a lousy life as a result.

01:31.070 --> 01:36.743
Because the only thing I ever like to do is work and after work, right away, run into the bar.

01:36.964 --> 01:40.792
Because after all, you just did a day's work and you deserve a drink.

01:41.253 --> 01:42.777
Especially in this business.

01:42.797 --> 01:45.623
So I used to drink a lot and it was terrific.

01:45.643 --> 01:47.427
You tell lies at the bar.

01:47.845 --> 02:16.823
and listen to stories it was terrific and you can be forgiven forgetting things that happen oh who cares what happened it's great well i'm teasing because you had you had one thing no one went on in those newspaper saloons which does not go on in new york anymore anywhere i can only speak for my own time there's no bar they get everybody goes into and in those bars as you know there was always somebody with a memory

02:17.157 --> 02:25.753
Not the kind of cold, pitiless memory a computer drags up for you when you go to the files.

02:26.474 --> 02:30.181
I mean, they tell you a lot of addresses and not much else.

02:31.764 --> 02:36.432
They'd have a guy at the bar who had covered something, had been around something,

02:36.682 --> 02:45.976
He could tell you what the weather was like and who was there and who talked and who said what away from the reporters, who got mad, who got drunk, who did this.

02:46.357 --> 02:49.181
And I remember that same day this happened and that happened.

02:49.201 --> 02:57.915
And it would be go into your mind and add to your law, add to your knowledge, add to your experiences.

02:58.115 --> 03:01.440
And as you wrote, you could get the clips on the economy.

03:01.859 --> 03:09.851
And then you had the memory of the guy telling you about it to go with the clips or the, what do you call it, Nexus, Lexus, whatever you get it.

03:09.911 --> 03:18.624
Yeah, I use everything in sight, and I still would love to have somebody have told me something about it horribly.

03:20.727 --> 03:28.018
So I think that's missing in the newspapers, and they don't go to bars.

03:28.454 --> 03:35.401
They go home, all people in the news business seem to go home, or they go to health clubs, they have a glass of wine at home at dinner.

03:36.262 --> 03:43.911
And they're not going to make for a very healthy life, it makes for a much better family life than you all.

03:44.111 --> 03:56.084
I think they're not as good, and I think the leaders get murdered because they are boring, and that is the number one sin in any religion, and in any breaking of any law, to be a bore.

03:56.124 --> 03:57.465
That's a felony.

03:58.154 --> 04:00.976
I just couldn't agree with you more.

04:01.016 --> 04:04.179
I think the quality of reporting is peck journalism.

04:04.379 --> 04:05.200
It's crazy.

04:05.640 --> 04:07.562
Well, I always ran away from it.

04:07.782 --> 04:10.204
I talk about that in my book.

04:10.224 --> 04:13.007
I sound like another guy, shamelessly killing.

04:13.127 --> 04:27.739
But when Kennedy from this town was killed in 1963, I went up the walk of the White House, the driveway to the White House, and here was in front of him was Haile Selassie from Ethiopia, a short man.

04:28.073 --> 04:32.358
in a pompous uniform with feathers and decorations.

04:32.458 --> 04:39.565
And next to him was Charles de Gaulle towering over him, wearing the uniform of a French non-commissioned officer.

04:39.585 --> 04:42.088
It was a great scene, but it's not good for me.

04:42.108 --> 04:43.830
I can't make a living writing about that.

04:44.270 --> 04:48.535
So I'm going into the White House, and I'm trying to tell myself, I've got to get away.

04:48.555 --> 04:50.196
There's 3,000 reporters here.

04:50.236 --> 04:51.638
I cannot make it here.

04:52.279 --> 04:53.180
What am I going to do?

04:53.220 --> 04:54.961
And I said, well, let's get the central thing.

04:54.981 --> 04:56.443
It's a funeral?

04:56.609 --> 05:02.945
The main thing in a funeral is burying somebody, burial, so I'll go and get the guy that dug the grave.

05:03.306 --> 05:05.010
I can't talk to the guy being buried.

05:05.050 --> 05:07.637
I'll go talk to the guy who dug the grave for him.

05:07.657 --> 05:10.524
And I went inside for a moment, and Art Buckwall was there.

05:10.564 --> 05:13.070
He's from the Herald Tribune, the paper I was on.

05:13.511 --> 05:14.213
Fellow alum.

05:14.682 --> 05:19.046
Yeah, so I said I told him I can't I'm gonna go get the grave digger.

05:19.066 --> 05:22.149
He said that is a good idea That's a very good idea.

05:22.250 --> 05:26.213
I said thank you and I left fortified by his encouragement his judgment.

05:26.414 --> 05:38.045
He's smart as hell Yeah, he's a smart fella I went to I went to the cemetery I found the grave digger his name was Polly.

05:38.065 --> 05:41.148
He got three dollars and ten cents an hour to dig the grave.

05:41.669 --> 05:42.850
He said it's an honor and

05:43.437 --> 05:45.420
He did it on a Sunday, his day off.

05:46.542 --> 05:54.254
And then the funeral came on, and here's Eisenhower, Truman, the Hedge Estate, or from all over the world.

05:54.795 --> 05:57.279
And probably just like a working man, they wouldn't let him in.

05:57.600 --> 05:58.802
Soldiers told him, go away.

05:58.822 --> 06:05.272
You know, he wasn't dressed well enough to go to the funeral that he had given him the grave.

06:05.292 --> 06:07.656
So he went and dug more graves for him.

06:07.906 --> 06:15.014
Yeah, some serviceman from Somerville sailor died in 1917 war as a result of it.

06:15.574 --> 06:19.899
I mean, he was in that war and now he's being buried as a soldier.

06:19.919 --> 06:28.448
And he got $3.10 and then he came back and he went to the gravesite when everybody was gone.

06:28.508 --> 06:32.833
He looked at it and he liked the way he knew they needed some new turf here.

06:33.033 --> 06:53.691
he would fix that and he said it's an honor the whole thing that was running away from the crowd they did the same thing at the church hill always run away run for your life away from a crowd because i think the public is lied to when you get five cameras on somebody and they're talking

06:54.160 --> 06:56.404
You know the guy is only talking for himself.

06:56.444 --> 06:58.528
He's not trying to tell anybody anything.

06:58.648 --> 07:02.636
He's not going to give you anything new, which is the word familiar.

07:02.656 --> 07:04.139
So pull your cameras out of there.

07:04.159 --> 07:05.481
The man is only going to lie.

07:05.582 --> 07:06.543
Don't talk to him.

07:06.603 --> 07:09.168
The camera has screwed up good stories.

07:09.890 --> 07:10.110
Yes.

07:10.090 --> 07:12.873
Because you let the camera do the work for you.

07:12.973 --> 07:14.454
Yeah, and it doesn't do any work.

07:14.594 --> 07:18.438
What it does is stand there, and it's an accomplice to a liar.

07:18.558 --> 07:21.020
And the liar usually is the politician.

07:21.160 --> 07:24.083
You did the same thing in the Churchill matter.

07:24.143 --> 07:31.230
I mean, you know, using that nexus stuff, you could find out where that damn painting is, by the way.

07:31.530 --> 07:31.690
No.

07:32.371 --> 07:36.655
I found a woman with a Rubens painting in her house, and it was a row house.

07:36.854 --> 07:39.137
Oh, she had introduced Churchill.

07:39.157 --> 07:40.439
We gotta find out where that is.

07:40.640 --> 07:41.661
I could probably find out.

07:42.502 --> 07:44.405
Ruben J. Jardine.

07:45.066 --> 07:45.487
Oh, yeah.

07:45.507 --> 07:46.729
Well, I mean, I'm good at that.

07:46.809 --> 07:48.812
I'm pretty tight with museums and stuff.

07:48.872 --> 07:50.855
It's a great big painting.

07:51.216 --> 07:53.018
Well, I mean, it's worth a fortune.

07:53.139 --> 07:54.160
You're absolutely right.

07:54.881 --> 07:59.588
And I remember the woman, that lady, Cynthia Colville, I met her in front of Churchill's hospital.

07:59.608 --> 08:00.590
He's inside Dimes.

08:00.610 --> 08:01.952
She went to visit him.

08:01.992 --> 08:02.553
She didn't let her in.

08:02.573 --> 08:03.654
They opened the door up to her.

08:03.674 --> 08:04.556
Well, they let her in.

08:04.576 --> 08:05.377
That was what was really good.

08:05.397 --> 08:06.118
Because her...

08:06.807 --> 08:08.870
Like they wouldn't let the grave digger in if they were there?

08:08.890 --> 08:10.592
No, they let her in because she's wealthy.

08:10.632 --> 08:11.313
Money talk.

08:12.575 --> 08:15.299
She came down and said, oh, there's such a crowd.

08:15.399 --> 08:15.900
She was broke.

08:15.940 --> 08:17.402
She didn't have any money.

08:17.422 --> 08:20.486
Well, pedigree over there is the same as money, I guess.

08:20.807 --> 08:21.408
Better.

08:21.428 --> 08:25.734
The detective with the door took off his hat and held out his arm and ushered her in.

08:26.935 --> 08:28.778
I went home with her.

08:29.299 --> 08:34.546
She lived in a row house, and it was cold, greasy, cold house, with a rubens on the wall.

08:35.007 --> 08:35.127
Great.

08:35.292 --> 08:40.159
Do you think you would have written a memoir without your medical experience here?

08:40.179 --> 08:40.640
Yeah, I wouldn't have.

08:40.660 --> 08:41.842
I'm memoirs of it.

08:41.902 --> 08:42.663
That's not me.

08:43.444 --> 08:50.454
But what I did was I got this aneurysm discovered by sheer luck.

08:50.815 --> 08:52.056
Total accident.

08:52.076 --> 08:54.360
They were looking for something else and they found this.

08:55.061 --> 08:59.047
And the thing they were looking for was a nothing.

08:59.067 --> 09:03.493
It bothered my left eye for a while and it came from a nerve.

09:03.777 --> 09:07.063
was frozen with high blood sugar, stressed.

09:08.044 --> 09:11.650
Among other things, because I'm off that alcohol, you can't blame it on that.

09:12.772 --> 09:16.478
And I went to light.

09:17.640 --> 09:23.490
I'm not going to go through all this and not use it, use the experience and use the legwork.

09:23.993 --> 09:34.528
So I started to write and then I started to write everything that happened to me on the day I went to get the top of my head taken off in an operation in Phoenix, Arizona.

09:35.008 --> 09:39.515
So you pass the street, Blumstein's department store in Harlem.

09:39.535 --> 09:46.845
I remember Martin Luther King when he had a deranged woman plunged a letter opener into his chest.

09:47.534 --> 09:51.358
And two cops, Al Howard and Phil Arnano, saved his life.

09:51.478 --> 09:54.482
I was young, but I knew them.

09:55.282 --> 10:14.183
Then, very opposed to the Essex Hacier, the smell of the moot from the Manhattaners that Casey Stengel used to drink when Marvin Krohn-Murray would miss stepping on first base and get called out and then his excuse to Stengel was I didn't touch second either.

10:14.500 --> 10:17.944
And with that, Stengel would run to the bar and never come on.

10:17.964 --> 10:19.226
That's where I got my first book.

10:19.246 --> 10:22.870
He had a thousand Manhattans one night after he's thrown by Resetac.

10:23.211 --> 10:24.292
A thousand.

10:24.312 --> 10:25.974
And I'm on the periphery of the crowd.

10:26.034 --> 10:27.736
He always had a bomb with him, Stengel.

10:27.956 --> 10:32.802
I'm on the periphery drinking big cold beers, a hundred of them.

10:32.822 --> 10:37.208
And he said, I didn't have the money to pay an Essex house bill.

10:37.788 --> 10:38.449
Stengel...

10:38.632 --> 10:41.135
He did, but he was making sure he wasn't going to pay.

10:41.155 --> 10:46.643
He had some big businessman wanting to hang out with a big baseball manager, let him put his money up.

10:47.144 --> 10:48.365
That's the way he used to work.

10:49.267 --> 10:57.218
And he said, this thing is going to be under everybody's heel on a subway in the morning.

10:57.238 --> 10:58.760
What you're riding, you're crazy.

10:58.780 --> 11:01.063
He says, go home and write a book.

11:01.083 --> 11:04.488
Say Marvin Clumberg is the biggest moron ever to live.

11:04.508 --> 11:06.330
And people said, that's right, he is a moron.

11:06.350 --> 11:07.592
This fella's telling the truth.

11:07.808 --> 11:10.010
He says, I think you're going to get out of here and go home.

11:10.671 --> 11:17.677
So I went home, and to me, one of the tests of a good idea is its ability to last through the hangover.

11:18.177 --> 11:18.958
And this one did.

11:19.619 --> 11:22.241
And I wrote a book.

11:22.701 --> 11:27.866
And I'm writing a book on the first year of the New York Mets, the worst team in the history of baseball.

11:27.906 --> 11:32.991
Stengel, who had managed Joe DiMaggio, and I was managing Marvin Frumbois.

11:33.011 --> 11:34.612
Well, he was fun.

11:34.632 --> 11:37.815
Whiskey, sweet vermouth.

11:38.453 --> 11:47.926
I'm typing, and I get to a point, you know, you're not dealing with nuclear science or the political future of the country here when you're writing a sports story.

11:48.727 --> 11:53.994
So I'm writing a thing, and I get to a partner with Bigfoot, just that the words came out of me.

11:54.094 --> 11:54.775
It was very good.

11:54.855 --> 11:56.677
Can't anybody here play this game?

11:57.158 --> 12:00.843
So I put quotes around it and gave it a, put a, Stengel said it.

12:01.844 --> 12:05.389
It came out that way, and Stengel said it.

12:05.504 --> 12:09.971
Stengel says, but it was in the content with the way he taught.

12:09.991 --> 12:11.514
It was in Stengelese.

12:11.534 --> 12:12.415
Absolutely.

12:12.435 --> 12:15.060
He just didn't happen to say that precise thing.

12:15.901 --> 12:16.863
It came out that way.

12:16.883 --> 12:17.704
It was terrific.

12:17.744 --> 12:19.166
And Stengel thought it was wonderful.

12:19.186 --> 12:20.409
He wanted a copywriter.

12:20.429 --> 12:21.891
He said, that's my man.

12:21.911 --> 12:22.452
My man.

12:22.652 --> 12:24.335
He knows what I'm picking up.

12:24.355 --> 12:24.756
It's good.

12:25.216 --> 12:25.797
He loved it.

12:25.837 --> 12:29.163
He used to go like that.

12:31.066 --> 12:32.288
Well, they had a play.

12:32.774 --> 12:35.096
I woke up one morning home and I see it.

12:35.557 --> 12:36.638
They had to go play.

12:37.379 --> 12:38.720
Off board might play.

12:38.840 --> 12:40.642
Can't anybody here play this game?

12:40.662 --> 12:42.504
Well, I went freaking nuts.

12:42.524 --> 12:44.125
You can't copyright a title.

12:44.225 --> 12:46.668
I said, they stole my title.

12:46.688 --> 12:47.328
They stole it.

12:47.468 --> 12:48.790
And the agent said, no, they didn't.

12:48.810 --> 12:50.612
That's a quote from Casey Stengel.

12:50.912 --> 12:51.893
A different title.

12:52.013 --> 12:52.954
Look to him.

12:52.974 --> 12:53.554
I went back to bed.

12:53.935 --> 12:55.636
I says, crime does not pay.

12:57.238 --> 12:59.480
But even then, I don't think you can copyright a title.

12:59.500 --> 13:00.701
I don't know what you can do.

13:00.742 --> 13:01.262
You should.

13:01.377 --> 13:03.141
You should, but you can't.

13:03.201 --> 13:06.247
If I wanted to call my book Gone with the Wind, you could do it.

13:07.289 --> 13:09.534
It's ridiculous.

13:09.554 --> 13:16.669
So, I mean, those things, the smell of the promoter, the look at the department store, and then I got on the plane and went to the...

13:17.105 --> 13:19.969
I think they can operate on a brain surgeon.

13:19.989 --> 13:20.950
I'm looking at you.

13:20.970 --> 13:21.231
I can't.

13:21.311 --> 13:22.973
No, it's good.

13:23.514 --> 13:27.419
These things, apparently, it's like a jury verdict.

13:27.439 --> 13:29.402
You're guilty or not guilty.

13:29.562 --> 13:30.463
You're guilty.

13:31.926 --> 13:33.788
Most people don't even know what the hell it is.

13:33.888 --> 13:35.210
I didn't know when the guy said it.

13:36.071 --> 13:36.952
An aneurysm.

13:37.834 --> 13:41.158
I didn't know what it was except for newspaper obituary stories.

13:41.218 --> 13:42.420
You know that, too.

13:42.788 --> 13:45.732
My criticism.

13:45.932 --> 13:47.053
An aneurysm on the heart.

13:47.253 --> 13:49.897
Yeah, they go on the aorta, I found that out.

13:49.977 --> 13:54.042
This picture, Cone has one on his arm, that's rare.

13:54.662 --> 13:58.868
Mostly the brain, and you don't hear much about it.

13:58.928 --> 14:01.110
And this guy died on the operating table.

14:01.291 --> 14:02.852
Thanks, why don't you tell me that?

14:03.133 --> 14:04.514
Some more.

14:04.695 --> 14:08.239
It's a fait accompli.

14:09.198 --> 14:15.605
I remember they said anterior communicating artery right across the front of the brain.

14:15.705 --> 14:17.988
And it had a blister on it.

14:18.228 --> 14:19.930
It's a blister.

14:20.831 --> 14:22.533
Looks like a blowout on the tire.

14:23.154 --> 14:26.097
And this one was weak.

14:26.177 --> 14:30.042
You could see blood coursing through it.

14:30.062 --> 14:30.683
Swirling.

14:30.983 --> 14:31.463
That's it.

14:32.304 --> 14:35.368
And they operated.

14:36.329 --> 14:38.952
And I was very worried about the...

14:39.826 --> 14:42.991
coming out of it, not dead or alive.

14:43.011 --> 14:47.418
I had a faith in God that gave me serenity.

14:48.360 --> 14:50.904
And that's not religious fanaticism.

14:50.924 --> 14:52.626
That's plain common sense.

14:52.646 --> 14:55.271
Well, that's the state of grace here.

14:55.291 --> 14:57.815
If there's a phrase, it recurs.

14:58.376 --> 14:59.838
This is real.

14:59.858 --> 15:02.482
Well, I want you to talk about it.

15:03.223 --> 15:05.547
Well, I went through days

15:07.265 --> 15:12.878
When I found out I had this thing, and I just assumed they would come apart.

15:12.898 --> 15:14.201
Well, I don't fall apart yet.

15:14.602 --> 15:17.289
There will come a time when I'll fall apart.

15:19.333 --> 15:21.358
My imagination is something.

15:22.942 --> 15:28.010
The form on me, I'd be two to five to be.

15:28.170 --> 15:33.940
You know, that's Jimmy Cagney going to the electric chair, where you fall apart in the hallway.

15:34.300 --> 15:37.285
I figured that's going to happen as soon as I'm here.

15:37.686 --> 15:39.268
So try and cover it up.

15:39.308 --> 15:41.852
Try and not let people see how you're so scared.

15:41.872 --> 15:46.259
I was planning how I was going to not let you run out.

15:46.780 --> 15:49.144
But I said in the end, it's going to be something.

15:49.324 --> 15:49.725
I'll be...

15:49.908 --> 15:50.849
fucking murder.

15:50.969 --> 15:53.653
I'll be begging people and every other fucking thing.

15:53.713 --> 15:54.413
Look at this.

15:54.434 --> 15:55.255
Oh, I was mad.

15:55.635 --> 15:58.979
Because I know what the police don't, you know, one of those things that come out of me.

15:59.700 --> 16:00.961
Well, it never did.

16:01.002 --> 16:06.168
And as the date came on me, I grew calmer and calmer.

16:06.849 --> 16:13.857
I had a faith in God and a belief, deep belief all my life that I never went out of the bracket on about.

16:14.618 --> 16:18.683
And now it was just kind of, and I began to figure out

16:19.034 --> 16:34.493
I spent nearly all of my life in newspapers and writing in poor neighborhoods, people of color, and I thought it was an obligation, and I did it.

16:35.114 --> 16:38.698
All people in trouble live on the fifth floor of a walk-up.

16:38.718 --> 16:42.122
There's nobody in trouble on the first or second floor, no stories.

16:42.423 --> 16:44.005
on the first two flights.

16:44.566 --> 16:45.728
Five and six up.

16:45.948 --> 16:49.032
Because this is just something you've noticed through your ears.

16:49.052 --> 16:50.495
All trouble is upstairs.

16:50.875 --> 16:51.997
Start walking now.

16:52.017 --> 16:53.699
Do you have theory for that?

16:53.799 --> 16:56.423
No, they're looking to kill you, that's all.

16:56.583 --> 16:57.985
Keep walking.

16:58.005 --> 17:01.030
I just can't get any, I can never get anything easy.

17:02.251 --> 17:05.556
And so I thought that had a lot to do with.

17:05.656 --> 17:11.805
I mean, the favorite book I've ever done, it's called He Got Hungry and Forgot His Manners.

17:12.241 --> 17:14.485
It's about a cannibal in Brooklyn.

17:14.545 --> 17:20.375
A guy in Brooklyn came in from Africa, and he began to eat people because he was hungry.

17:20.395 --> 17:24.101
Well, I thought it was the best thing I did him was to sell 11 copies.

17:24.161 --> 17:25.423
Nobody wanted to read about it.

17:25.543 --> 17:28.428
Nobody wanted to know anything about Black Lives Matter.

17:28.548 --> 17:38.164
Now they're coming to a point where they're going to have to read that stuff because it's going to be not as crazy as I made it, but they're going to have children out on the street dying.

17:38.617 --> 17:41.079
the way it's going, and put one anyway.

17:41.520 --> 17:46.305
So I've done all that.

17:46.325 --> 18:02.741
So I just thought at the end that all those days, all those nights, all that, well, I didn't write some cheap mystery novel about a rich young woman out of the Washington Post married to a millionaire or something like that.

18:02.861 --> 18:04.843
But I didn't do that type of work.

18:05.195 --> 18:13.303
tried to do the other, it was just kind of, it was, I had done something for my soul and I'm now getting some help out of it.

18:13.323 --> 18:16.646
And I believed it was the state of grace.

18:16.826 --> 18:24.453
That's a Catholic belief, I guess, but the surgeon down there where I went told me to work there, they're looking for anything when they come in.

18:25.093 --> 18:29.377
You know, they're clean to some God or some form.

18:29.758 --> 18:31.539
Nobody goes in there alone, nobody.

18:31.680 --> 18:33.261
So I believed.

18:33.815 --> 18:37.158
I was so... Are you a regular churchgoer?

18:37.399 --> 18:38.740
I am, yeah.

18:38.920 --> 18:42.904
Almost 80% of the time, yeah.

18:42.924 --> 18:45.127
Is it something that kind of came up with that?

18:45.147 --> 18:46.348
No, I don't know.

18:46.949 --> 18:53.035
But it sure reinforced my thinking.

18:53.656 --> 18:59.822
Of course, the fear for you is the greater, the anxiety, I guess, is not life or death, but...

19:00.578 --> 19:02.402
You're talking about verbs and nouns.

19:02.562 --> 19:08.294
I mean, this is the part of the brain where, you know... Yep.

19:08.314 --> 19:09.396
It's right in front of the brain.

19:09.436 --> 19:11.501
That's where your language comes from.

19:11.561 --> 19:15.309
Where I had the angers and where they were going to be tinkering.

19:15.329 --> 19:17.473
So I thought that was a...

19:18.483 --> 19:21.348
It was a big worry.

19:21.368 --> 19:25.215
In fact, it should have been a danger.

19:25.235 --> 19:30.365
It should have had me terrified, but it didn't until I got to one point after the operation.

19:30.385 --> 19:31.968
But before it, nothing.

19:31.988 --> 19:42.347
And I was home that night before, and my wife went to bed, and everything's quiet in the bedroom, and I look out the window, there's a helicopter over the night sky in Manhattan.

19:42.867 --> 19:46.231
And it made me remember, and I was looking for some noise here.

19:46.291 --> 19:55.923
I mean, I can't go into a thing this huge involving me that there isn't some catastrophe around me.

19:56.003 --> 19:58.706
People wringing their hands and begging and crying.

19:58.866 --> 20:00.048
I had some noise.

20:01.169 --> 20:10.481
So I remembered I got on a helicopter with Ollie Greenberg, a photographer, pulled me on once at Kennedy Airport, and the Beatles were on.

20:10.501 --> 20:11.742
He was taking their pictures.

20:11.902 --> 20:12.503
He was a photographer.

20:12.753 --> 20:29.054
So we flew from Kennedy to the Wall Street heliport in Manhattan and over Queens that George Harrison takes off the buckle and begins to jump up and down the stream.

20:29.454 --> 20:30.315
We're crashing.

20:30.696 --> 20:31.597
We're going down.

20:32.398 --> 20:34.261
And then McCartney's screaming the same thing.

20:34.361 --> 20:36.403
Oh, yes, we're going to die, die.

20:36.423 --> 20:37.765
Oh, my God, save us.

20:38.032 --> 20:39.574
So everybody was doing it.

20:39.694 --> 20:46.042
The four of them in the pilot began to rock the helicopter to get it even crazier.

20:46.844 --> 20:49.347
And we landed and everybody tumbled out laughing.

20:49.467 --> 20:52.651
It was how they took a bus ride that way, I assume.

20:52.951 --> 20:54.854
But I remember them screaming, die, die.

20:54.914 --> 21:01.763
So I looked at it, I jumped out of bed and said, all right, but I began to scream, honey, I'm going to die tomorrow.

21:01.783 --> 21:02.324
Absolutely.

21:02.444 --> 21:03.786
Die, die, die.

21:03.866 --> 21:05.608
I'm going to wind up.

21:05.892 --> 21:11.057
A vegetable in the desert, I'm going to stare at the sun and say I see polar bears.

21:11.077 --> 21:12.318
You know, this is the end, Ronnie.

21:12.338 --> 21:12.999
We're all through.

21:13.039 --> 21:13.519
I'm through.

21:13.539 --> 21:14.060
It's over.

21:14.540 --> 21:17.383
She just looked at me, and then I tumbled, and I thought I went to sleep.

21:17.463 --> 21:19.745
I couldn't even cause trouble on my own behalf.

21:20.906 --> 21:31.776
But when I went down there, there was a guy in the hospital that anything you told him, if you held up a wristwatch, he said, that's a taxi cab.

21:33.177 --> 21:33.958
I heard that.

21:34.360 --> 21:37.583
Well, they held up a jacket and said, that's a taxi cab.

21:37.683 --> 21:39.065
The kids saw that car.

21:39.525 --> 21:39.886
They didn't.

21:40.546 --> 21:45.471
And then I heard later, you know, taxi cab on something else that I'd call and talk.

21:45.491 --> 21:49.756
Well, the guy, he had no nouns.

21:49.776 --> 21:50.276
Geez.

21:50.296 --> 21:56.562
Now, another guy, the numbers guy, the nurse pointed out, he said, you know, four, five, six.

21:57.683 --> 21:58.544
Four, five, six.

21:58.644 --> 22:01.167
I said, geez, I'm not a mathematician.

22:01.187 --> 22:03.169
It's not going to help me, the numbers.

22:04.010 --> 22:09.057
And I woke up from the thing, and I don't like waking up like that either.

22:09.437 --> 22:16.006
But I woke up from the operation while experiencing it.

22:16.146 --> 22:18.069
The minute I could, I tried to write.

22:18.149 --> 22:19.511
I wanted to write.

22:19.531 --> 22:25.619
So I started to write something out about the start of this thing I was going through.

22:25.639 --> 22:26.801
And I worked for three days.

22:26.921 --> 22:29.865
I really tried, and it tired me, and I worked.

22:29.965 --> 22:33.510
And when I looked at the product, it was pure Croatian.

22:34.081 --> 22:38.407
And it was unintelligible.

22:39.829 --> 22:44.035
And I had done it, you know, straight, like I did everything else, and it just didn't come out.

22:44.215 --> 22:50.704
So I thought, then there'd be something, the amount of it would be a gap in my mind or something, and I'm in trouble.

22:52.887 --> 22:56.312
And I became overwhelmingly depressed, and I didn't know where I was going.

22:56.993 --> 22:59.937
And then the one thought came in that, if I can,

23:00.440 --> 23:09.372
If I can see what's the matter, if I can understand it's wrong, then maybe I must have a way to fix it and do it right.

23:09.392 --> 23:14.740
So I just thought, come on, I mean, it's only a living dependent on this whole thing.

23:15.360 --> 23:16.182
Start!

23:17.884 --> 23:23.832
Start!

23:24.858 --> 23:32.769
I worked and finally I got one subject, verb, object, period to slip out of a block bank on the paper.

23:32.789 --> 23:44.907
I worked and another one appeared and then finally I got a paragraph down and it was, you know, I wrote it, as you can tell, Leslie wrote it and I was back.

23:45.628 --> 23:48.672
But it was, you know, the radio.

23:48.803 --> 23:53.668
Without this experience, would there have been a memoir at this point, or would you have done a memoir at all?

23:53.688 --> 23:53.808
No.

23:54.188 --> 23:55.750
Who the hell cares about me?

23:55.850 --> 23:57.231
You know, that was my stand.

23:58.453 --> 24:00.635
Writers are supposed to write about other people.

24:00.655 --> 24:03.938
So, but basically, you said, well, I'm going through this.

24:03.978 --> 24:04.759
This is property.

24:04.779 --> 24:06.400
I may as well pay attention.

24:06.420 --> 24:06.821
Absolutely.

24:06.841 --> 24:07.522
No question.

24:07.542 --> 24:09.463
That's the only reason I did it.

24:09.483 --> 24:11.505
It's, you know, legwork.

24:12.406 --> 24:12.506
Yeah.

24:12.526 --> 24:15.429
Well, I love the line in there that you get your news on the two train.

24:15.449 --> 24:16.150
Is that what it is?

24:16.450 --> 24:17.471
I love that line.

24:17.491 --> 24:18.152
It's good one.

24:18.487 --> 24:24.240
Of course, I didn't know this about you, that you don't drive a car.

24:24.260 --> 24:24.681
No, I don't.

24:24.721 --> 24:27.787
And I'm thinking of this as in fighting and the goddamn turnpike coming in.

24:27.928 --> 24:28.990
I don't drive a car.

24:29.331 --> 24:30.273
You never have a car.

24:30.313 --> 24:30.593
No.

24:30.794 --> 24:31.095
Never.

24:31.556 --> 24:34.763
I mean, didn't kids consider you kind of a wimp before?

24:34.783 --> 24:35.624
Well, I show up.

24:36.186 --> 24:37.288
I don't know.

24:37.994 --> 24:42.621
Most of the kids didn't have cars because the bus stopped right in front of my house.

24:44.123 --> 24:45.105
It went to the subway.

24:45.145 --> 24:47.188
But there wasn't a badge of manhood then as it was.

24:47.548 --> 24:47.668
No.

24:47.969 --> 24:50.152
The subway was close enough to walk to.

24:50.292 --> 24:51.354
We had two L's.

24:51.414 --> 24:52.956
And I love the New York subway system.

24:52.976 --> 24:54.639
Two L's and a subway.

24:56.842 --> 24:58.424
And a bus.

24:58.584 --> 25:04.173
And I was working nights in a newspaper.

25:04.193 --> 25:07.798
I finished at 24 in the morning in the sports department.

25:09.179 --> 25:14.886
You know, putting the last box for us on the West Coast, marking them for the paper.

25:14.906 --> 25:19.432
And then you'd run to get into the bar, you know, about a quarter to two.

25:19.452 --> 25:20.393
That was the year.

25:20.473 --> 25:25.720
You had to be in there by then.

25:25.740 --> 25:29.364
Drink until four, 4 a.m., 10 orders, and 32 beers.

25:30.125 --> 25:34.170
And you'd have it to drink while the guy was mopping the place up.

25:34.270 --> 25:36.553
You could drink, because you hadn't bought them.

25:36.635 --> 25:39.038
I'll never forget the first interview you and I had.

25:39.559 --> 25:41.561
It's got to be now, 15 years ago.

25:41.581 --> 25:43.683
I was over at the Ritz.

25:43.704 --> 25:50.992
And you ordered me, I thought you ordered us both scotch, but you ordered three, and they were all three for me, you know?

25:51.012 --> 25:52.013
And I said, well, what about you?

25:52.114 --> 25:53.575
You said, oh, I don't drink anymore.

25:53.655 --> 25:55.538
I said, Jesus Christ, you're going to kill me.

25:56.339 --> 25:59.282
And you said, well, you know, you said, I don't drink anymore.

25:59.362 --> 26:03.307
And it's not the drinking that kills me, but it's the hangovers.

26:03.407 --> 26:06.591
And I said, I have to agree, as you get older,

26:07.162 --> 26:13.031
It takes longer and longer to recover, doesn't it, from these things?

26:13.051 --> 26:21.463
We went into the second day, the hangover, laid into the second day, and that's it for me then.

26:21.483 --> 26:25.008
Because I couldn't, I can't do anything with a hangover.

26:25.028 --> 26:26.090
I'm a zombie.

26:26.671 --> 26:29.875
And if it's going to go two days, then it can go three soon.

26:29.915 --> 26:31.277
That's it.

26:31.558 --> 26:31.758
Goodbye.

26:31.778 --> 26:32.519
That's right.

26:32.860 --> 26:34.562
Now you've given up the column, is that right?

26:34.783 --> 26:35.143
Yeah.

26:35.478 --> 26:45.909
So now, what it is, I'm under contract for five years to the Los Angeles Times Syndicate into Newsday, and I'm supposed to write periodically.

26:45.929 --> 26:48.692
And that's what I do.

26:49.032 --> 26:52.095
No, because I'm doing another book.

26:52.416 --> 26:53.236
It's a novel.

26:53.316 --> 26:56.980
I don't even know what it's about.

26:57.461 --> 26:59.663
You've written a ton of books.

26:59.896 --> 27:02.279
What's the breakdown of novels to nonfiction?

27:02.299 --> 27:02.719
I don't know.

27:02.739 --> 27:04.060
It's pretty even, though, probably.

27:04.080 --> 27:04.981
Yeah, I guess, yeah.

27:05.001 --> 27:11.128
I mean, I can figure that out, but I guess I'm just curious about what you're enjoying more.

27:11.248 --> 27:17.395
Novel is the best fun, the most work, and the riskiest.

27:17.415 --> 27:18.836
Why are there more work?

27:18.856 --> 27:21.479
I mean, you can invent it.

27:21.659 --> 27:27.045
Because there's not one scene that you don't have to make up yourself.

27:27.065 --> 27:29.768
And at the same time, it's got to be based on more.

27:30.170 --> 27:33.114
fact and truth than a news story.

27:33.816 --> 27:37.301
You've got to have an awful lot of research going on.

27:37.421 --> 27:40.506
That's my own.

27:40.526 --> 27:41.748
And I do think you're right.

27:41.788 --> 27:45.714
You put more of yourself out there on the line at this point.

27:45.794 --> 27:47.697
Yeah, they all can criticize and call your names.

27:47.717 --> 27:48.658
It's great.

27:49.800 --> 27:53.826
So you say the next book is a novel?

27:54.066 --> 27:54.507
Yeah, yes.

27:54.908 --> 27:56.991
Tell me about New York.

27:57.011 --> 28:03.138
I think it's the greatest city in the world myself.

28:04.159 --> 28:07.744
I'm very pleased to see that the crime situation is receiving that.

28:10.787 --> 28:14.532
I don't know if I'm asking a question there.

28:14.552 --> 28:15.774
No, you're not.

28:16.334 --> 28:21.000
For the first time in my life, I'm very suspicious.

28:21.959 --> 28:27.246
I often wondered, how is all this crack getting into that?

28:28.167 --> 28:28.647
How is what?

28:28.948 --> 28:32.933
All this crack, all of a sudden, appeared.

28:34.474 --> 28:37.118
And I wonder, how did this happen?

28:37.218 --> 28:40.542
I mean, there seems to be no way to stop it.

28:40.562 --> 28:45.088
The San Diego Mercury News... San Jose.

28:45.108 --> 28:48.131
San Jose, I mean, Tappy Allison was on that tape.

28:48.151 --> 28:48.492
Terrific.

28:48.512 --> 28:48.692
Terrific.

28:49.077 --> 28:57.405
They're doing 32 parts on the CIA selling drugs to the black gangs in central Montana.

28:58.486 --> 29:04.271
I wouldn't believe it except I lived in New York when the crack suddenly appeared in such volume I didn't know what hit us.

29:04.291 --> 29:06.554
What would the point be?

29:07.454 --> 29:08.055
Oh, I'll tell you.

29:08.095 --> 29:09.096
The point's obvious.

29:09.136 --> 29:11.318
That's why it's possible.

29:11.338 --> 29:16.703
There was a huge shipment on a plane, an Eastern Airlines plane at Kennedy Airport.

29:16.723 --> 29:17.464
They found it.

29:17.967 --> 29:19.248
They took the whole plane.

29:19.569 --> 29:21.010
It was up in front of us.

29:21.711 --> 29:28.437
Now, my daughter asked me, why haven't they located another plane?

29:28.457 --> 29:30.599
They stopped looking.

29:32.741 --> 29:40.128
I think the reason was to keep the black neighborhoods shooting at each other so you could run and say, look at all the crime in the city.

29:40.789 --> 29:41.970
Get a suburban vote.

29:43.171 --> 29:45.233
Oh, yeah.

29:45.253 --> 29:46.995
Yeah, you know, I...

29:47.330 --> 29:49.432
I believe it's true.

29:49.452 --> 29:51.574
They wouldn't pass a gun control bill.

29:52.054 --> 29:56.378
All they wanted was shooting in black neighborhoods.

29:56.518 --> 30:00.582
And also they made a fortune of money selling it.

30:00.602 --> 30:01.783
Who's they?

30:01.863 --> 30:02.344
CIA guys.

30:02.444 --> 30:04.345
Who themselves do you think?

30:04.686 --> 30:05.626
I don't know.

30:05.707 --> 30:08.709
The organization is such a shambles.

30:08.729 --> 30:10.691
It has initials and that's all.

30:11.171 --> 30:15.075
They had a guy in there stood to the heart and I was all sitting at the desk

30:15.258 --> 30:16.782
What was his name?

30:16.802 --> 30:18.666
Oh, what was his name?

30:18.687 --> 30:19.549
Audrey James.

30:19.569 --> 30:20.331
He's drunk.

30:20.351 --> 30:21.413
He don't know his name.

30:21.433 --> 30:23.118
And he's living in a million-dollar house.

30:23.138 --> 30:28.170
Living in a million-dollar house, getting phone calls to come and pick up $50,000 to go at the next best business.

30:28.437 --> 30:31.200
They thought there was something the matter, but he wasn't sure.

30:31.500 --> 30:32.782
That's how smart they were.

30:33.502 --> 30:36.506
You're talking about the gang who couldn't shoot straight.

30:36.526 --> 30:39.929
Well, it's the town drunk in the middle of the office, and they didn't know him.

30:39.969 --> 30:40.510
Who was he?

30:40.550 --> 30:41.571
Well, he's in charge.

30:41.671 --> 30:42.732
Leave him alone.

30:42.752 --> 30:44.834
I mean, that's just amazing.

30:44.854 --> 30:50.500
So you still maintain a healthy, cynical disrespect for bureaucrats?

30:50.520 --> 30:56.807
Yeah, but I can see them stepping out and selling stuff.

30:57.226 --> 30:59.989
I truly hope you're wrong about that.

31:00.850 --> 31:01.250
Why?

31:01.411 --> 31:03.513
That's a hell of a way to approach the next millennium.

31:03.753 --> 31:04.814
No, I think they were.

31:05.215 --> 31:06.336
I just assumed they were.

31:06.356 --> 31:08.358
They had a guy like Walter James doing it.

31:08.378 --> 31:09.019
That's amazing.

31:09.980 --> 31:14.185
Well, if you had him in the place, you're capable of anything, aren't you?

31:14.425 --> 31:19.791
As you approach the next century, what is your take on human nature?

31:20.125 --> 31:21.927
Does it ever change?

31:21.947 --> 31:22.628
I don't know.

31:22.748 --> 31:23.409
Does it ever change?

31:23.429 --> 31:26.173
I think there's something the matter with the politics now.

31:26.193 --> 31:29.017
That's why Shakespeare retains his strength, doesn't he?

31:29.077 --> 31:31.480
He understood it exactly the way it is today.

31:32.021 --> 31:34.724
There is something the matter with the politics, though.

31:34.744 --> 31:36.887
It is cheaper.

31:38.289 --> 31:40.111
That's obvious.

31:40.131 --> 31:43.816
You see Bob Dole in the medical records issue.

31:43.836 --> 31:45.458
What the hell are they trying to say?

31:46.028 --> 31:49.371
I think they're trying to suggest maybe he had syphilis on the platform.

31:49.612 --> 31:50.352
So what?

31:50.432 --> 31:51.573
I mean, so what?

31:51.593 --> 31:53.716
You know, I agree with him, so what?

31:54.016 --> 31:57.319
And I don't care if Dole had so, I mean, I don't care.

31:58.120 --> 32:11.113
I think, I think I do laugh at the Sunday shows, the announcers come on, and his guys, Russets, and what's her name?

32:11.133 --> 32:15.597
Roberts, they're telling, they're telling Dole,

32:16.201 --> 32:20.316
that he has to change in his personality, his demeanor, his speech.

32:21.139 --> 32:25.474
He's 73, not because he's doing so fairly.

32:25.494 --> 32:26.498
Now he's doing terrible.

32:27.136 --> 32:29.619
He's running for president of the United States.

32:29.639 --> 32:32.342
That's certainly a lousy career he's had.

32:32.362 --> 32:34.364
They're saying he's a failure.

32:34.484 --> 32:35.265
He's doing great.

32:35.646 --> 32:37.388
He's not going to make it so long.

32:37.408 --> 32:38.169
He's a nice guy.

32:38.209 --> 32:40.731
He's a nice guy, and he did the best he could.

32:40.771 --> 32:46.017
It wasn't good enough to run the whole country, but it was good enough to get him into the last game of the World Series.

32:46.078 --> 32:46.878
That's pretty good.

32:47.379 --> 32:49.161
Now, the other guy...

32:49.546 --> 32:50.647
Clinton, he wants to be.

32:50.687 --> 32:52.469
What does he want to be?

32:52.489 --> 32:52.669
Kennedy?

32:52.689 --> 32:54.511
Don't tell him that.

32:54.611 --> 32:57.534
I don't know what he wants to be.

32:57.614 --> 32:59.216
He's a pro, though.

32:59.756 --> 33:00.537
What's his name?

33:00.557 --> 33:01.658
That guy, what was his name?

33:01.718 --> 33:04.921
Roger, the Republican guy.

33:04.941 --> 33:10.567
The guy that used to be the... He pulled out early.

33:10.587 --> 33:12.129
He says, this guy can take a hit.

33:12.469 --> 33:16.633
He says, people underestimate this guy every step of the way.

33:16.782 --> 33:20.027
I don't underestimate him doing that.

33:22.532 --> 33:26.719
I don't overestimate his personal commitment.

33:26.779 --> 33:28.301
He'll do anything good.

33:28.321 --> 33:30.225
He'll do anything good.

33:30.866 --> 33:32.569
And so will his wife.

33:35.954 --> 33:42.385
She could still say with a straight face she made $100,000 on a legitimate deal.

33:43.158 --> 33:46.402
Which I don't care about, but don't tell me you did it legitimately.

33:46.462 --> 33:48.084
At least wink at me.

33:48.144 --> 33:49.346
Well, it was done years ago.

33:49.406 --> 33:51.388
I mean, I got... Yeah, so I don't care about it.

33:51.408 --> 33:52.269
Don't give a shit about that.

33:52.289 --> 33:55.514
But just wink when you said retelling it, you have to.

33:55.534 --> 33:57.536
The other one was like... Oh, it's like I didn't inhale.

33:57.596 --> 33:59.919
I mean, that's... Who cares?

33:59.939 --> 34:00.720
I mean, don't say it.

34:00.900 --> 34:02.042
Don't insult us.

34:02.062 --> 34:02.963
It's like saying O.J.

34:02.983 --> 34:03.604
is innocent.

34:03.904 --> 34:05.046
I'm driving in this morning.

34:05.106 --> 34:06.407
The thing is about custody.

34:06.668 --> 34:07.429
I saw your piece.

34:07.449 --> 34:08.830
You had a piece on the O.J.

34:08.910 --> 34:10.212
matter, and there's a new book out.

34:10.664 --> 34:12.647
So, I mean, we don't have to get into that.

34:12.667 --> 34:13.648
What piece was this?

34:13.728 --> 34:18.454
He wrote a piece with an Esquire or something about, I'm sorry, he did it.

34:19.676 --> 34:20.557
Jealousy one.

34:21.218 --> 34:23.541
Give me a break.

34:23.561 --> 34:27.566
I just read Jeffrey Toobin's new book.

34:27.586 --> 34:29.028
Yeah, I need this on the tape.

34:29.288 --> 34:30.229
Fuck, man.

34:30.249 --> 34:30.850
I don't know.

34:31.083 --> 34:33.926
He puts bullshit on him.

34:34.087 --> 34:38.172
He's accusing all these other people of being politically correct.

34:38.812 --> 34:46.722
He's saying that the reporters inflated OJ's intelligence, which is probably true.

34:46.842 --> 34:48.264
Intelligence?

34:48.284 --> 34:49.826
He's full of shit outside.

34:50.287 --> 34:50.867
He is.

34:50.887 --> 34:57.175
But there's a line that Tubin says early on in the trial, not in the trial, but in the proceedings,

34:57.847 --> 35:04.021
that they determined, this is Tubin's line, that a strand of hair was of African American origin.

35:05.685 --> 35:08.411
There's no such thing as African American hair.

35:08.431 --> 35:11.097
It's like Greek American hair or Irish American hair.

35:11.313 --> 35:21.126
You know, but in their wish to not offend anybody and to use the going phrase, that's a cultural phrase, that's an ethnic phrase, it has nothing to do with race.

35:21.987 --> 35:25.311
But this guy in his own book uses that phrase.

35:26.593 --> 35:30.598
This is fairly recent African-American terminology.

35:30.658 --> 35:31.500
And I can see that.

35:31.520 --> 35:33.442
I can respect it.

35:33.542 --> 35:34.303
I can't.

35:34.524 --> 35:35.525
I tell them why.

35:37.407 --> 35:40.932
Because I was brought up by doing these freaking newspapers

35:41.131 --> 35:43.655
And I can't fit it in a one-column head.

35:44.035 --> 35:47.160
Now, what am I supposed to do if I'm on a copy desk?

35:49.002 --> 35:49.884
With FM?

35:50.625 --> 35:52.888
At least like a financial company.

35:53.629 --> 35:54.631
I don't know what they're doing.

35:54.831 --> 35:56.593
I don't like it.

35:56.614 --> 35:58.056
The guy's in New York City.

35:58.416 --> 36:02.442
If it becomes important to the story, he becomes of color or black.

36:02.823 --> 36:06.548
If it isn't important to the story, why don't you leave it out?

36:06.588 --> 36:06.989
That's right.

36:07.069 --> 36:09.332
But it becomes ridiculous when they're talking about...

36:09.548 --> 36:15.153
hair, which is racial, and it's got nothing to do with the ethnic designation.

36:15.193 --> 36:18.156
But it just shows how absurd that we take it.

36:19.057 --> 36:21.098
Anyway, I've got plenty of stuff in this.

36:21.899 --> 36:22.720
Take your time.

36:22.840 --> 36:26.443
But I would like you to describe my book.

36:26.463 --> 36:28.465
Do you need a pen?

36:29.226 --> 36:30.987
I've got a pen.

36:31.007 --> 36:32.268
The book speaks for itself.

36:32.629 --> 36:37.513
Your writing is right on, I've got to tell you.

36:37.932 --> 36:38.653
What the fuck?

36:38.673 --> 36:39.173
I bought it.

36:39.193 --> 36:43.318
Somebody gave it to me yesterday.

36:43.338 --> 36:44.119
Fucking guy.

36:45.220 --> 36:46.141
This guy here.

36:46.622 --> 36:48.885
He's been around, I think.

36:48.905 --> 36:49.906
I don't know who the hell he is.

36:49.926 --> 36:50.967
They sent it to me yesterday.

36:51.027 --> 36:52.269
Lexington Herald Reader.

36:52.289 --> 36:53.930
Yeah, but I like what he says.

36:53.951 --> 36:56.734
He's a neurosurgeon.

36:56.814 --> 36:59.397
The name of Lexington is a neurosurgeon.

36:59.717 --> 37:03.622
Yeah, but the one thing I'm most proudest of, I worked very hard on this stuff.

37:04.723 --> 37:05.644
What do you call it?

37:06.502 --> 37:08.324
Description, it doesn't matter.

37:08.344 --> 37:09.306
The inscription?

37:09.426 --> 37:13.952
Yeah, yeah.

37:13.972 --> 37:17.516
Well, remember I sent you a... You've probably forgotten.

37:17.536 --> 37:22.062
You gave a... You got an honorary degree at Holy Cross College.

37:22.523 --> 37:22.623
Yeah.

37:22.643 --> 37:26.868
And I sent you the picture of... Remember I said we got a picture in the morgue?

37:26.888 --> 37:27.529
Yeah.

37:27.770 --> 37:28.450
I hope you've done it.

37:28.471 --> 37:30.173
What's in September?

37:30.193 --> 37:31.154
Today's the 16th.

37:34.919 --> 37:35.800
Today's the 16th.

37:36.877 --> 37:38.259
The book's fine.

37:38.579 --> 37:40.482
What I wanted was a couple of quotes.

37:40.622 --> 37:43.526
Why doesn't the Globe only ran a few paragraphs?

37:43.586 --> 37:44.407
I'm on a fucking show.

37:44.427 --> 37:45.469
Oh, they're a pain in the ass.

37:45.789 --> 37:48.593
They ignored my book, you know, up until a year.

37:48.653 --> 37:51.918
They finally wrote a big feature on me in June, a year after the book came out.

37:52.559 --> 37:54.461
B-A-S-B-A-N-E-S.

37:54.481 --> 37:54.962
Good for you.

37:55.242 --> 37:55.923
Good Greek name.

37:57.545 --> 38:02.412
So they did a big takeout on me in June, a year after the book came out.

38:02.432 --> 38:04.555
I was in my fifth printing at that place.

38:04.990 --> 38:07.594
It was a feature.

38:07.614 --> 38:08.195
It was nice.

38:08.636 --> 38:10.358
It went out on the New York Times wire.

38:10.379 --> 38:11.801
It got picked up all over the country.

38:12.081 --> 38:13.503
It was nice.

38:13.523 --> 38:20.815
But a year later, Bob Taylor gave me a nice thing in his column.

38:20.835 --> 38:22.938
You can't complain.

38:22.958 --> 38:24.541
I got ignored by the Daily Times.

38:24.601 --> 38:26.364
I got a full page on the Sunday Times.

38:26.544 --> 38:27.425
Go figure, right?

38:27.466 --> 38:27.986
You don't know.

38:29.889 --> 38:31.572
I read Christopher Lehman Hopps.

38:31.889 --> 38:34.315
He sounds, he's a pain in the ass.

38:34.355 --> 38:36.540
You overstate the relevant of your titles.

38:36.901 --> 38:38.504
No, I'm very important.

38:39.767 --> 38:40.168
That's right.

38:40.188 --> 38:41.712
You go fuck ass, you make her crazy.

38:42.153 --> 38:47.004
It was time for Bombass to have fun anyway, the whole thing.

38:47.024 --> 38:48.868
If they read, I say, yes, he says,

38:49.051 --> 38:50.153
He says, I know what to do.

38:50.413 --> 38:52.096
I shall challenge him to a duel.

38:52.397 --> 38:56.624
You know, they would say that's a dangerous killer or something.

38:56.684 --> 38:57.726
He used to do it.

38:57.746 --> 39:04.096
But I think your claim that you revitalized the concept of the American column is fair.

39:04.317 --> 39:05.980
Yeah, that's fair.

39:06.120 --> 39:10.006
Because everybody did, never mind trying to be Irish, but they did try to write like that.

39:10.647 --> 39:11.008
Yeah, it's fair.

39:11.630 --> 39:13.693
Look at Mike Barnacle here.

39:14.194 --> 39:16.377
He has his lunch on Jimmy.

39:16.537 --> 39:18.460
Yeah, what the hell's the difference?

39:18.480 --> 39:19.882
You come as my hair all right?

39:20.103 --> 39:20.884
Yeah, I look great.

39:20.944 --> 39:21.365
All right.

39:21.865 --> 39:22.987
Yeah, what's the difference?

39:23.187 --> 39:24.229
There's no difference, yeah.

39:25.271 --> 39:26.873
All the world is your Bartlett.

39:26.973 --> 39:29.517
You take any stuff and do it again.

39:29.537 --> 39:36.808
You know that line, the line from Yates, true, long as supper comes the heart of stone into stone.

39:36.948 --> 39:38.110
That's his great line, I think.

39:38.798 --> 39:45.825
I'm reading Montaigne, which is the only thing anybody ever read, the three volumes of Montaigne.

39:46.765 --> 39:49.548
Damon Runyon arrived in New York with nothing.

39:49.568 --> 40:00.038
He had a three-volume set of Montaigne, and Gene Fowler, who was the best probably ever to live, came in, and that's all he had with him.

40:00.058 --> 40:00.518
You're kidding.

40:00.659 --> 40:02.801
No, three-volume set of Montaigne.

40:02.821 --> 40:05.363
Do you have this in your Damon Runyon book?

40:05.383 --> 40:06.744
Yeah, Westbrook, I don't know.

40:06.764 --> 40:08.586
Yeah, Westbrook, Pegler had it.

40:09.562 --> 40:10.323
So what is it?

40:10.343 --> 40:12.246
Jay Breslin had it.

40:12.266 --> 40:19.017
I don't know what it is, but if you read it, the guy is ahead of the, by a millennium ahead of the world.

40:19.057 --> 40:21.040
He really could figure things.

40:21.761 --> 40:29.734
So I'm reading it, and he has in there a line that he's used, turns the heart of stone, Montaigne.

40:29.754 --> 40:32.278
And then he says this is where he got it from.

40:32.663 --> 40:35.887
A thousand years before that Summer Act put it down.

40:35.947 --> 40:39.673
Now, Yates going around with a fresh oil like he invented poetry.

40:39.973 --> 40:41.435
This is his famous line.

40:41.956 --> 40:42.637
Well, that ain't.

40:42.657 --> 40:43.338
He stole it.

40:43.358 --> 40:46.181
The same as I'm looking through the book to steal one myself.

40:47.043 --> 40:47.583
I see.

40:48.244 --> 40:52.670
And all these people are taking everything so fucking serious.

40:52.710 --> 40:54.993
You ever read The Lost Illusions?

40:55.014 --> 40:56.175
I sound like I read a lot.

40:56.195 --> 40:56.516
I don't.

40:56.536 --> 40:59.059
But this I had to read by Balzac.

40:59.512 --> 41:06.780
He says he went to, he gets a job on a newspaper in Paris, a little paper, and he's going to start out as a writer.

41:07.161 --> 41:08.923
So his friend tells him how you do it.

41:09.303 --> 41:14.389
You're supposed to turn in, get a short, they call them short little stories, you get paid for it.

41:14.409 --> 41:21.076
But you must do four, because you're turning four, the editor will take the best one for himself.

41:21.136 --> 41:23.699
He'll steal it and put his own name on it.

41:23.719 --> 41:24.400
He'll use it.

41:24.840 --> 41:26.262
Now they'll throw out,

41:26.579 --> 41:33.150
One, two, not good enough, and they'll take one more, so that will give you one, and the other will have it.

41:33.171 --> 41:34.353
And you'll get a payday.

41:34.373 --> 41:36.917
And you'll get a payday, and keep bringing in four.

41:39.101 --> 41:41.966
And make sure one of them is very good for the editor to steal.

41:42.046 --> 41:45.893
Well, I'm starting to live because that's the only business I ever knew.

41:46.594 --> 41:48.317
You know, for my sake.

41:48.989 --> 41:51.072
You're robbed, what is this?

41:51.092 --> 41:53.955
What are you nervous about?

41:53.975 --> 41:55.517
You've got to go, it's far off.

41:55.557 --> 41:56.799
Where do we go to now?

41:57.079 --> 41:59.963
You've got an idiot.

42:00.023 --> 42:03.347
Arthur was going to be the guest, and his son was graduating.

42:03.367 --> 42:05.069
Tip O'Neill called me the night before.

42:05.109 --> 42:06.251
You remember, good for you.

42:06.451 --> 42:15.863
He called me the night before, Leo Dill, and I got to stand up for Arthur, because his daddy passes, they just tried to pull the lug from under him.

42:15.883 --> 42:17.545
So I'm there making a speech, all these

42:18.740 --> 42:22.505
Greek and Irish Catholics are there, Jesus.

42:22.985 --> 42:25.689
And sister, Mother Teresa was there.

42:27.151 --> 42:27.731
Amazing.

42:27.751 --> 42:38.966
I went there, and they said, you know, folks, I see a woman there, the hands clasped, she's imitating Jesus Christ.

42:38.986 --> 42:42.610
So I go to the phone, and I call home, and I says, I can't match this.

42:45.554 --> 42:46.215
I said,

42:47.191 --> 42:49.975
That was the first time I ever saw her.

42:49.995 --> 42:51.156
Anybody ever saw her.

42:52.398 --> 42:53.940
She always was an amazing woman.

42:53.960 --> 42:55.241
She'd ride by helicopter.

42:55.261 --> 42:56.643
She was in the hospital this morning.

42:56.683 --> 42:59.287
I heard it on the radio.

42:59.627 --> 43:00.148
She fell down.

43:00.388 --> 43:00.949
What'd she do?

43:01.109 --> 43:02.030
She fell down.

43:02.050 --> 43:03.652
She's got a brain problem today.

43:03.692 --> 43:04.133
She does?

43:04.914 --> 43:07.778
Yeah.

43:07.798 --> 43:10.201
Her doctor is a guy here burglar.

43:10.521 --> 43:11.983
She sent me down.

43:12.318 --> 43:17.125
I'm surprised you went to Arizona for that, and they couldn't do this for you up here in Boston, you know?

43:17.145 --> 43:19.408
A hundred people told me to go there.

43:20.249 --> 43:20.830
To Arizona.

43:20.890 --> 43:23.594
And the guy finishes you in its next case, right?

43:23.994 --> 43:24.896
He does hundreds.

43:24.916 --> 43:25.897
I don't know.

43:25.917 --> 43:27.259
He's a good fella, I mean.

43:27.639 --> 43:28.260
Oh, I mean, no.

43:28.300 --> 43:29.322
That doesn't bounce.

43:29.562 --> 43:30.684
I mean, it bounces.

43:31.425 --> 43:32.066
I don't care.

43:32.086 --> 43:34.149
The patches kind of hit the curveball, right?

43:34.849 --> 43:36.472
And he gets thrown a curve.

43:36.492 --> 43:36.852
Yeah.

43:36.932 --> 43:38.815
He brings it up.

43:39.267 --> 43:43.153
So he hit the tarp posulate.

43:44.114 --> 43:45.276
And out of the park, too.

43:46.218 --> 43:47.179
And out of the park.

43:47.199 --> 43:48.561
You hit it out of the park.

43:48.581 --> 43:50.764
Otherwise, I mean, I'm here.

43:50.785 --> 43:50.905
Great.

43:52.046 --> 43:52.908
It's a pleasure always.

43:52.928 --> 43:57.635
If I hadn't had a good day, I would have, you know, wouldn't have been too good.

43:57.655 --> 44:01.661
Well, you had, anyway, Grafton's next to what?

44:01.701 --> 44:02.302
It's next to what?

44:02.382 --> 44:02.983
Next to what?

44:03.063 --> 44:03.324
I'm sorry.

44:03.344 --> 44:04.065
You told me.

44:04.465 --> 44:05.667
It's Fully Square.

44:05.707 --> 44:07.370
Was your late wife from Milford, Mass?

44:07.550 --> 44:08.211
No.

44:08.562 --> 44:12.366
Did you have any kind of connection with Milford Ness?

44:13.327 --> 44:13.467
No.

44:13.487 --> 44:15.809
Because you gave a talk down there at a library once.

44:15.890 --> 44:16.390
Milford Library.

44:16.410 --> 44:23.778
Yeah, there was a guy that worked for... Because I gave the 10th anniversary and they said Jimmy Breslin was here 10 years ago.

44:23.798 --> 44:26.320
The guy... Same guy that got me, I think.

44:26.360 --> 44:27.341
Who was he?

44:27.361 --> 44:28.983
From one of the papers here for the Hellas?

44:29.023 --> 44:29.624
Exactly.

44:29.664 --> 44:30.705
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

44:30.745 --> 44:31.726
And I can't think of his name.

44:31.766 --> 44:32.326
Irish guy.

44:32.647 --> 44:33.928
Yeah.

44:34.330 --> 44:35.251
He brought me eight.

44:35.271 --> 44:36.272
He had me come in.

44:36.292 --> 44:37.653
Yeah, it was lovely place.

44:37.733 --> 44:43.959
Well, you were there for the commissioning of the library, and I was there for the 10th anniversary.

44:43.979 --> 44:46.341
Yeah, yeah, I was doing that.

44:46.522 --> 44:49.584
And I said, well, how the hell did they do somebody like Jimmy Breslin?

44:49.604 --> 44:50.906
The guy called 111 times.

44:51.726 --> 44:53.588
111 fucker times.

44:53.648 --> 44:57.512
And I said, yes, 110 times, you know, which I used to.

44:57.532 --> 44:57.912
That's it.

44:57.932 --> 44:58.533
You've got to go.

44:59.434 --> 45:01.516
Well, listen, I've got to go.

45:01.536 --> 45:03.898
Oh, it's wonderful, you know.
