WEBVTT

00:03.794 --> 00:05.817
Test one, two, test, test, test.

00:06.879 --> 00:27.771
It seems to me that so much that began a kind of monastic tradition, and the idea that what you're talking about is that there's a kind of parallel, you know, heading towards the millennium monastic movement of people rediscovering books, caring for books, arming their own selves about reading.

00:28.092 --> 00:32.198
Well, that's going to be a chapter in this book.

00:32.583 --> 00:48.027
What I got from my husband's birthday recently was an Italian grandma

00:48.007 --> 00:50.710
The Puro's grandfather.

00:51.211 --> 00:59.881
And in it, the Puro's grandfather has written his own poem after getting thrown out of Harvard.

01:02.624 --> 01:04.707
We have Henry James' pop.

01:05.748 --> 01:06.549
You do?

01:06.669 --> 01:08.151
Are you a real collector?

01:08.291 --> 01:09.913
Oh, we are.

01:09.893 --> 01:16.286
My husband said, I can't wait for you to meet because we have a lot of stuff to talk about.

01:16.426 --> 01:17.208
No, we do.

01:17.228 --> 01:18.450
We try to connect.

01:18.511 --> 01:26.387
What I did with this book afterwards is there were a couple books that I bought after this book.

01:26.487 --> 01:31.497
One was a room of our zone sign.

01:31.477 --> 01:37.486
Prelude, which is the manuscript, the first copy.

01:37.506 --> 01:40.771
So just a number of things, tracking down books.

01:41.692 --> 01:47.621
But the books as the objects, the marginalia, I'm very interested in.

01:47.741 --> 01:48.061
Oh, exactly.

01:48.081 --> 01:49.924
There's a conference in Cambridge in England.

01:49.944 --> 01:54.130
This is why I might go to a marginalia conference.

01:54.150 --> 01:56.474
My wife says, a marginalia conference.

01:56.494 --> 01:58.196
Are you going to do a chapter?

01:58.356 --> 01:59.458
Yeah, of course I am.

01:59.438 --> 02:03.167
Don't you think that's important?

02:03.208 --> 02:16.401
When I was at the University of Toronto, they brought out this book, Montcalm, and it's the book, I can't do it justice right now, but basically he's written in this book, this whole poem about

02:16.702 --> 02:22.890
It's actually, we're not doing a very good job.

02:23.351 --> 02:27.536
It just happens to be a book that itself is filled with history.

02:27.556 --> 02:31.782
All of it, the marginality.

02:31.802 --> 02:42.196
When I buy a book by an author I love, and especially if it's signed, what I do, the first thing I do is go ahead.

02:42.216 --> 02:43.778
I'm going to write a column on this.

02:43.798 --> 02:45.460
I'm writing a little book, two books.

02:45.440 --> 02:48.011
Your spare time.

02:48.111 --> 02:52.730
I don't want to do it, but it's about collecting.

02:52.851 --> 02:55.281
All I can do in my sleep.

02:55.666 --> 03:02.260
But everybody knows you should have a perfect fine book that has this pristine book.

03:02.441 --> 03:12.122
I would much rather have a book that has been written in, that you can see where it strikes to what you've written about in your own book.

03:12.142 --> 03:13.425
You really need to see that.

03:13.445 --> 03:15.750
Owen Gingrich, you know Owen Hartford?

03:15.916 --> 03:17.602
Pauline's only in my neighborhood.

03:17.622 --> 03:26.553
Pauline is stuck his life, tracking down every copy, every actual physical copy of the 1st and 2nd edition of Copernicus all over the world.

03:26.693 --> 03:27.897
Why is he done that?

03:27.918 --> 03:28.660
Nice to see that.

03:28.960 --> 03:33.184
He wants to see how they influence the individual owners.

03:33.564 --> 03:36.587
Is there marginally other annotations in there?

03:36.647 --> 03:44.255
Because somebody said this is the greatest book that's never been read.

03:44.395 --> 03:56.166
You have a beautiful feeling about, you know, potent and I'm forever, ever giving finding books under the stack.

03:56.146 --> 03:59.714
that I say, this really should be a moment, I'm sorry.

03:59.814 --> 04:02.019
And it's an incredible thing.

04:02.039 --> 04:06.389
And the whole history of this book, I have to get into it.

04:06.409 --> 04:07.492
Do you do that?

04:07.592 --> 04:08.775
I do that all the time.

04:08.795 --> 04:09.757
Do you turn them over?

04:09.777 --> 04:10.879
I turn them over, for example.

04:10.899 --> 04:11.761
Tell me about this, if you don't.

04:11.781 --> 04:12.984
Okay, no, no, for example.

04:13.545 --> 04:14.307
No, no, for example.

04:14.287 --> 04:17.833
And your capacity as a teacher at Harvard?

04:18.114 --> 04:27.711
Yeah, I go in and the main thing is, you know, I try to still teach one course there so I can use the library, I mean, because that's all that I really want.

04:27.731 --> 04:35.705
That's really all that I have, so I'll teach one memoir writing class at the extension just to keep learning.

04:36.186 --> 04:38.370
Well, my idea of heaven is to spend

04:38.873 --> 04:42.182
22 hours a day in the Bough of Widener.

04:42.623 --> 04:42.904
Really?

04:43.706 --> 04:46.593
Do you have any idea how good this quote?

04:47.676 --> 04:54.975
No, I saw, for example, in Lamont, which is the undergraduate library, which is where they take out, and the debaters take out chapters of books,

04:55.597 --> 05:05.242
One day I pulled down the shelf, Emerson saw his recollections about his father, and I opened it up, and it's signed by Sarah Orangelo, and it's her copy.

05:05.643 --> 05:12.340
And so I went to the desk and said, listen, you have two copies here, but you know that this room,

05:12.320 --> 05:19.191
And now, about a year ago, before Gisela sees me, they sell me for a lot of money.

05:19.472 --> 05:21.756
She has, she has.

05:21.896 --> 05:28.607
So I found that, okay, when I have

05:28.587 --> 05:35.261
Sarah Oren Jewett's copy of Marjorie Fleming.

05:35.321 --> 05:36.484
This was in Widener.

05:36.544 --> 05:37.786
This is in Widener.

05:37.826 --> 05:41.694
Signed on one of her earliest signatures.

05:41.755 --> 05:43.418
So I said this has to go in.

05:43.478 --> 05:45.803
And then also Marjorie Fleming's

05:46.947 --> 05:56.722
The cousin she stayed with Isabella married this naturalist, Wilson, who was one of those great naturalists.

05:56.742 --> 05:59.151
I found his book on the staff

05:59.705 --> 06:07.640
in the philosophy, geography section and I went in and I said this should be in Houghton, at Wellesley, it's in the rare collection.

06:07.700 --> 06:11.047
Will we be able to get the actual title of these books?

06:11.067 --> 06:12.289
Yeah, absolutely.

06:12.349 --> 06:13.391
Okay, think of it.

06:13.471 --> 06:19.182
I hope at some point, seriously, in your discussions

06:19.162 --> 06:27.175
We could have you to dinner or something because we could, my husband is a great, great, great, great, I mean, his whole world is going to be a collector.

06:27.336 --> 06:27.877
Yeah.

06:27.897 --> 06:29.600
But he has a lot of people.

06:29.960 --> 06:30.481
Book people.

06:30.621 --> 06:34.688
Remember the title of it is Book People, Book Places, and Book Culture.

06:34.708 --> 06:35.329
Oh, yeah.

06:35.349 --> 06:37.052
I want to do a chapter on Sarah April.

06:37.842 --> 06:39.727
Okay.

06:40.208 --> 06:42.313
Susan Sontag has in her house.

06:42.714 --> 06:48.087
I wanted to get Susan Sontag because she doesn't get anything to her side.

06:48.287 --> 06:49.671
I think... You don't.

06:49.691 --> 06:50.112
Would you?

06:50.212 --> 06:50.974
Yeah, I could.

06:54.211 --> 06:58.819
I tried to repress G and they said don't even try, so I didn't try.

06:59.179 --> 07:00.021
I will.

07:00.682 --> 07:04.428
Because she has a tile from the library in Sarajevo.

07:04.448 --> 07:05.630
She's got your house.

07:06.432 --> 07:14.245
And the other thing too is my husband, for example, whose parents were Ukrainian intellectuals who fled the Communists.

07:14.225 --> 07:16.129
I'm going to just tell you about Ukrainians.

07:16.350 --> 07:19.697
It's post-Soviet book culture.

07:19.777 --> 07:21.601
Okay, well here's one of the aspects.

07:21.621 --> 07:23.525
Isn't this book too ambitious?

07:23.545 --> 07:24.166
No, no.

07:24.346 --> 07:25.088
It's wonderful.

07:25.108 --> 07:27.974
It should be what Virginia Woolf talks about a diary.

07:28.475 --> 07:30.419
It should be a capacious hold-all.

07:30.439 --> 07:32.183
It should be so elastic.

07:32.163 --> 07:37.889
and it should have everything that should be eclectic.

07:38.149 --> 07:47.159
His grandfather was a teacher and a great book collector.

07:47.179 --> 08:01.174
He left his library, my husband's grandfather, left his fantastic library with sort of the earliest Ukrainian grammar, a very literate library, very, very literate library.

08:01.154 --> 08:04.658
left it in the Archbishop's Palace.

08:04.739 --> 08:13.169
And his parents went back after the fall of the Soviet Union and went back and saw this collection there now under glass that they all own.

08:13.189 --> 08:15.272
So there's a lot of stories around that.

08:15.332 --> 08:16.413
You've got to have it.

08:16.453 --> 08:18.636
You just have to come to dinner.

08:18.716 --> 08:19.297
Come to dinner.

08:19.317 --> 08:20.659
Well, get together.

08:20.679 --> 08:21.620
Come to dinner at that place.

08:21.860 --> 08:23.903
But I actually want to see his stuff more.

08:24.003 --> 08:24.644
Okay.

08:24.724 --> 08:27.988
Yeah, my husband, I have to say,

08:27.968 --> 08:38.760
us that just keep the credit card down because, you know, we just got a catalog for some auction, which you probably got for the one about autographed letters.

08:38.780 --> 08:48.570
And we were going through and he goes, oh, really cool letters.

08:48.690 --> 08:52.534
I'm like, you know, I'm saying postcards.

08:52.594 --> 08:56.018
We could give you a tremendous amount of material.

08:55.998 --> 09:00.524
I mean, did you know that?

09:00.625 --> 09:01.926
Right, right, right.

09:01.946 --> 09:06.973
For that period when there was no Poland.

09:06.994 --> 09:07.434
Right, which is often.

09:07.454 --> 09:14.063
I mean, when it was ruled by the National Library of Poland was in Paris.

09:14.084 --> 09:15.165
I didn't know that either.

09:15.606 --> 09:16.908
And right, John said, check it out.

09:17.148 --> 09:17.989
It's a fascinating story.

09:17.969 --> 09:23.279
They have more stuff about Poland than they have from Poland.

09:23.299 --> 09:39.829
Well, I never quite understood that connection because there were a lot of, you know, certainly Polish other grades and Poles, but one of the things that your story is so interesting is that also when you think about Art Plunder and all the wonderful stories of how things were stored, including in Monte Cassino and why not libraries?

09:40.109 --> 09:40.991
You know, they were moved.

09:41.011 --> 09:41.732
That's right.

09:41.712 --> 10:00.835
They moved all of that stuff from Rome down to Monte Cassino and luckily it survived.

10:00.815 --> 10:03.218
Right, right.

10:03.338 --> 10:11.088
I can't just write because I want so I can read it.

10:11.108 --> 10:12.610
I'm going to just constantly bring it forward.

10:12.630 --> 10:12.790
St.

10:13.511 --> 10:19.459
Gaul, I mentioned, there are almost 10 libraries, but you have to do a week to spend a week.

10:19.479 --> 10:20.400
A brand new library.

10:20.420 --> 10:22.262
I've already been to a brand new British library.

10:22.563 --> 10:25.827
Nobody has been in to live every day, so I've left such a day in there.

10:25.807 --> 10:46.405
The new German library, which opens in two weeks.

10:46.705 --> 10:54.852
Now in Leipzig,

10:55.304 --> 10:58.107
Go ahead.

10:58.207 --> 11:01.011
Let's talk about this.

11:01.711 --> 11:07.458
I was going to say Omari Rousseff.

11:07.598 --> 11:12.264
Double-rated... ...over the last 10 years, double-rated their sellers.

11:12.284 --> 11:23.877
They're going to do it in your public library, and they're asking you to pick 10 books that you think in order

11:24.683 --> 11:31.801
My number one pick was the Anne Frank.

11:31.942 --> 11:35.371
I picked that number one.

11:35.391 --> 11:39.722
I picked up some slavery number two.

11:39.702 --> 11:47.571
and then the next six, whatever they were.

11:47.631 --> 11:51.355
That's fascinating.

11:52.136 --> 12:02.267
And Frank's book, and I think that's a good way to enter the discussion about your book.

12:02.247 --> 12:04.730
What is it about that book?

12:04.870 --> 12:06.492
It's private.

12:06.512 --> 12:08.314
Do you think she meant for this to be right?

12:08.334 --> 12:10.998
It's private and yet it's universal, isn't it?

12:11.158 --> 12:25.956
It's private and it's universal, but I think that one of the things that strikes us so much about why Anne Frank's diary, you know, has such a heart in our imaginations, a couple of things, first of all, because it's the one voice that stands for the six million that were sounded, not sort of a given.

12:26.076 --> 12:30.702
But I think it's something about diary that this is what always fascinated me.

12:30.682 --> 12:42.043
was that Anne Frank, as you know, was given this diary as a birthday present.

12:42.063 --> 12:48.355
And every night when she wrote in it, she deposited her diary and put it in her father's briefcase.

12:48.375 --> 12:53.044
So you have a hidden diary and a hidden briefcase in a secret annex.

12:53.024 --> 12:57.511
So you have all sorts of conjugations of violence.

12:57.992 --> 13:18.643
At the same time, what people aren't terribly aware of, because what we think of this is, you know, the first thing is about a sort of Holocaust story, is that Anne Frank realized that she wanted to use her diary to become a writer, and she talks about to use her diary as the basis of a book that she was going to write after the war.

13:18.623 --> 13:23.777
And so what most people don't know about Anne Frank's diary is that she started to rewrite the diary.

13:24.179 --> 13:29.955
She was rewriting it all the way up to the last sort of month or so.

13:30.035 --> 13:33.645
But she was changing scenes, adding scenes.

13:33.625 --> 13:36.669
She started to keep notebooks with other stories.

13:36.709 --> 13:39.572
She kept notebooks of reading lists.

13:39.592 --> 13:43.858
Essentially, without anybody in secret and it's knowing she was turning herself into a world.

13:43.878 --> 13:44.919
It was a work in progress.

13:44.939 --> 13:57.034
It was a work in progress, but what I think it does is that, for me, I think, you know, when I read this, you know, when I was young, one of the things is that I saw that it was this rehearsal

13:57.014 --> 13:58.738
of ambition.

13:59.219 --> 14:06.375
It wasn't just confession, but this is a rehearsal of somebody who wanted to become a writer.

14:06.616 --> 14:10.465
It was a wonderful entry in there.

14:10.485 --> 14:13.251
It's, I think, May 11, 1944, where she says,

14:13.231 --> 14:41.803
she addresses that the diary is you, and she says, oh my God, I can get you the exact quote, but she says, you know, you've known for a long time that my greatest wish is to become a writer, a journalist, and that she was training herself, and I love her, to be a writer, but what people don't know is the fact that she was editing the diary, and the only reason it survived is

14:43.657 --> 14:54.744
which is when the Nazis needed, they took the briefcase, they dumped everything on the floor, and the papers were rescued.

14:54.764 --> 14:59.877
But I think the other thing, that diary has a kind of emblem of what I think most diaries

14:59.857 --> 15:03.704
even though most people will say, I'm only writing for myself.

15:03.864 --> 15:08.432
But I think it's almost impossible to write without wondering who the audience is.

15:08.452 --> 15:11.818
And Virginia Woolf said, who do I tell when I tell a blank page?

15:11.838 --> 15:22.978
But I think that the fact that Anne Frank's diaries survived and went into 52 different languages, I think in some ways underlined it secretly with every diary keeper's, which is

15:22.958 --> 15:31.252
Maybe my diary will go off and come down pretty well.

15:31.272 --> 15:41.470
In my book, when I went to see the Peeps Library, what's very important is that Peeps, I mean, these are the 3,000 books.

15:41.490 --> 15:48.021
Not only are these the 3,000 books, but this is where you sell them, and how you sell them, and they must never be moved.

15:48.001 --> 16:07.967
I was fascinated with your book about that because I've never, I love Cambridge and I've never seen

16:07.947 --> 16:09.510
Yeah.

16:09.530 --> 16:15.864
And also, you know, it was interesting, and I was wondering about the secret code that he wrote, and you sort of explained this.

16:15.884 --> 16:16.465
Not a code, no.

16:16.485 --> 16:18.289
Exactly, which I thought was fascinating.

16:18.309 --> 16:21.496
He took it out of a book on a shorthand book.

16:21.516 --> 16:24.302
Well, don't you think that, I mean, even that da Vinci kept

16:24.282 --> 16:43.264
a notebook, and as you say, it's not really the earliest diary, but what we have is that he keeps this in hand way, and it can only be read when it's held up to a mirror, and you have somebody like Pete keeping it in something other than accessible.

16:43.284 --> 16:47.048
I mean, you have to work at reading.

16:47.068 --> 16:48.550
You can't just penetrate it.

16:48.610 --> 16:51.393
That's for sure.

16:51.413 --> 16:54.036
I love the fact that you reminded us that

16:54.016 --> 17:17.408
And they did this for 48 years, and their marriage, I think, is one of the most... Well, it's typical, but what I think that shows, their marriage, you know, is from the beginning, from the beginning, one of her first entries is about him.

17:17.388 --> 17:19.752
Well, I think they were problematic.

17:19.952 --> 17:26.604
The Toasters used their diaries like the way most modern couples use divorce attorneys to kind of litigate with one another.

17:27.826 --> 17:32.013
But diaries were also measures of ambition in that marriage.

17:32.033 --> 17:41.590
She used her diary in many ways as much to chronicle her becoming his unofficial literary agent, starting her own publishing company.

17:41.570 --> 17:45.934
chronicling her own stories that she was writing, and then wanting the copyrights.

17:46.014 --> 17:52.079
I mean, one of the reasons, you know, he left was he owned the copyrights to his diaries, not just to the novels.

17:52.260 --> 17:55.483
And he started to lock them away from her.

17:55.503 --> 18:11.577
I think the thing that's so extraordinary is that when she copied out War and Peace seven times and it ran 3,000 manuscript pages and so she was copying that out, her daughter would then become a cottage industry of diary transcribers and, you know,

18:11.557 --> 18:20.149
I think the thing is that what is it that there is a long tradition

18:20.821 --> 18:24.568
people who use other people's diaries for creative work.

18:24.828 --> 18:36.188
I mean, we have William Wordsworth going through Dorothy's diary, which is one of the first entries in there, and she said she's keeping her diary because it will give William pleasure.

18:36.589 --> 18:41.698
And they had this tacit agreement that he could read, and so many of them, you know, that

18:41.678 --> 18:50.912
Did you ever read a book about 15 acres stole by a whale?

18:51.196 --> 18:52.077
No.

18:52.498 --> 18:52.979
No.

18:52.999 --> 18:56.684
And it's basically Melville's reading of the diary from the Essex.

18:56.965 --> 19:00.089
And he borrowed it overnight.

19:00.130 --> 19:01.592
What was the Essex all about?

19:01.612 --> 19:05.878
That's the only recorded instance of a ship being sunk by a whale.

19:05.898 --> 19:07.320
And what does the novelist keep?

19:07.340 --> 19:09.043
And what does the novelist find?

19:09.063 --> 19:13.069
I mean, the story about the survival of those open boats is spectacular.

19:13.089 --> 19:13.830
It's unbelievable.

19:13.850 --> 19:14.511
It's horrific.

19:14.631 --> 19:15.533
It's true surprise.

19:15.553 --> 19:17.676
Let's see who it can cancel out.

19:17.656 --> 19:20.099
And that didn't get into movies, you know.

19:20.620 --> 19:29.753
That's what's so interesting about diaries, and I think especially writers' diaries, where they have all that raw detail and go back to use it.

19:29.833 --> 19:35.702
What they choose to use is just as important as what they choose not to use.

19:36.082 --> 19:36.663
Exactly.

19:36.683 --> 19:38.606
You say that in your book as well.

19:38.786 --> 19:39.147
Exactly.

19:39.167 --> 19:47.038
And you have things like, you know, one of my favorite journals is, and I think it's closer to how most people think, and somebody like Catherine Mansfield,

19:47.018 --> 20:02.040
Journalists literally have titles of short stories that she used to write, followed by shopping lists where she puts up a price of tea and marmalade, followed by which is a meditation on marriage, followed by which is an idea for a future short story.

20:02.020 --> 20:13.031
But she calmed Cheating Wolf, ran back and calmed their diaries during the dry seasons of their writing life for what they could pull out for future novels.

20:13.132 --> 20:14.536
It was all in there.

20:15.218 --> 20:17.464
To The Lighthouse had that

20:17.444 --> 20:26.439
It was triggered by that single image of an acorn going across the floor, you know, which is something that had been in her mind a long time in her diary.

20:27.240 --> 20:31.507
I love the way we started in the hospital drugs.

20:31.747 --> 20:33.310
Nine years old.

20:33.290 --> 20:40.997
Obviously, this is a lifelong passion.

20:42.839 --> 20:45.121
It's a lifelong fascination, I think.

20:45.141 --> 20:53.128
But one of the things that I come from, like many people who would probably read your poem, I come from a family of hidden writers.

20:53.869 --> 20:56.851
I come from several generations of diary keepers.

20:56.871 --> 21:03.297
My grandmother kept a traditional chronicle diary joining the Red

21:03.277 --> 21:04.276
loss as a literacy

21:08.930 --> 21:20.968
When I was eight, I was given a diary by my mother, and I'll come back to that.

21:20.988 --> 21:26.115
When I was 11, I found my mother's own diaries and drafts of stories in the linen castle.

21:26.135 --> 21:32.404
My sister, who is now in her 60s, keeps in Hope News Journal, drafted novels while rising through a kid.

21:32.424 --> 21:36.270
What I saw going through all of these is his instinct to write.

21:36.250 --> 21:41.339
I go back to when I was giving a diary, and I thought, this is wonderful.

21:41.359 --> 21:42.868
My family knows that I like

21:45.818 --> 21:56.070
in the introduction, what I could not articulate, it took me many years, but what bothered me is that a diary was for self-expression, but why did I need a lock?

21:56.350 --> 22:04.539
And what went through, all looking in my immediate family, they had silence and ambition.

22:04.640 --> 22:12.028
There was everything within me, and yet there was this enormous ambition,

22:12.008 --> 22:17.132
her career in self-expression.

22:17.152 --> 22:19.995
I think that's what we see in Anne Frank's journals.

22:20.255 --> 22:25.039
I think that's why we read writers' journals.

22:25.400 --> 22:30.884
We love eavesdropping on these narrative lines to know how, in fact, did they learn to, how did they invent themselves in their diaries, because they do.

22:30.904 --> 22:34.968
I mean, Mantua talks about burning like huge complaining diaries of her childhood.

22:36.229 --> 22:41.914
The one she kept, though, from 19 on, is where she's still complaining about, you know, things in her diaries.

22:41.894 --> 22:46.746
But from 19 on, she's starting to use her diaries as a sketch pad.

22:47.187 --> 22:49.312
She's starting to think about short stories.

22:49.373 --> 22:51.959
She's starting to write over her dialogue.

22:52.521 --> 22:57.152
All of these diaries, I think that people have loved it.

22:57.132 --> 23:03.540
are great working records of creative life.

23:03.660 --> 23:08.847
And when I was certainly starting out in my 20s as a writer, I was so hungry for information about creative life.

23:08.867 --> 23:12.231
It seemed to me when I walked into a bookstore, it was a kind of miracle.

23:12.251 --> 23:14.934
How do books get written, let alone published, but how do they get written?

23:14.954 --> 23:16.997
How does somebody negotiate that obstacle course?

23:17.146 --> 23:40.069
not just an external one, but an internal one of self-sensorship, perfectionism, the invisible lock that's on the diary, and where I kept going back to again and again with writer's diaries.

23:40.089 --> 23:42.111
But creativity, clearly, this is not just about a diary.

23:42.131 --> 23:44.874
No, this is really... I think we should make that point.

23:44.894 --> 23:46.656
This is a... It's really a book about literary creativity.

23:46.676 --> 23:47.136
I was interested in

23:47.116 --> 24:07.565
and the fact that it paralleled my own life so far, that there are wonderful values for each stage of a writer's life, from childhood to old age.

24:07.585 --> 24:14.094
And so I've tried to do the book where it begins with a seven-year-old genius child, ends with a writer at the beginning of junior at 60, and going into her 80s with the girl.

24:14.114 --> 24:16.077
And in between, what were all the stages?

24:16.057 --> 24:29.535
You have something like the James family, which I think most people could relate to today.

24:29.555 --> 24:41.490
What do you do when you're a very smart creative person yourself, and yet you're born into a family that tells you you must excel, that your one brother has become one of the world's great novels, the other is a great psychologist,

24:41.470 --> 24:57.899
You moved to another country, you gave a diary at 40, and don't tell anybody you're taking this diary.

24:57.919 --> 25:00.624
They don't find out until after you're there.

25:00.644 --> 25:02.186
So how do you keep the creativity alive in a competitive family?

25:02.206 --> 25:03.328
It's very interesting why I was saying she thought that.

25:03.348 --> 25:05.292
It was a wonderful role that told us to come together among the other two brothers.

25:05.312 --> 25:05.472
Exactly.

25:05.492 --> 25:05.993
I'm so kidding.

25:05.973 --> 25:11.199
They couldn't cope with it at all.

25:11.399 --> 25:12.100
They couldn't cope.

25:12.120 --> 25:22.993
You know, at the Harvard Faculty Club, there's that little box-off box, you know, and it said, it's only Alice, Henry, and William, and nobody knows about the other two.

25:23.574 --> 25:25.576
They served because the other brothers didn't.

25:25.596 --> 25:26.657
They just couldn't cope with it at all.

25:26.677 --> 25:27.739
They couldn't cope with it at all.

25:27.759 --> 25:29.841
They couldn't cope with it at all.

25:29.921 --> 25:30.662
They couldn't cope with it at all.

25:30.682 --> 25:31.423
They couldn't cope with it at all.

25:35.234 --> 26:03.857
What I love now about these diaries too, it's just like your book, the stories in a story, something like when Wolf and Mansfield met, I was haunted by this image that they sat at this suburban dinner party, like so many people here, and not knowing how much they were going to influence each other's life, the good and bad, but what they didn't know at that dinner party was that their husbands were going to make small fortunes,

26:07.128 --> 26:11.114
ten times more.

26:12.136 --> 26:28.743
And he was somebody who was a literary empoderator who understood how to take her very informed doing this, which is full of unsent letters and shopping lists and wonderful ideas on creativity.

26:29.124 --> 26:31.828
And he fashioned them into this world bestseller.

26:31.848 --> 26:33.591
But what I could, you know, I loved

26:33.571 --> 26:42.244
You know, I love reading Kafka's notebooks.

26:42.384 --> 26:44.687
I love all of them.

26:45.669 --> 26:47.852
You almost were destroyed when you came right there.

26:47.872 --> 26:50.837
You are going to be destroyed.

26:50.857 --> 26:51.457
I thought they were, you know.

26:51.477 --> 26:54.101
And so I often talk to people, I say, they tell, really, they have no rights.

26:54.121 --> 26:55.924
And people say, what do you mean they have no rights?

26:55.944 --> 26:58.187
I always come back with me with the example.

26:58.568 --> 26:59.810
Well, I guess Max Ward should have gone ahead and destroyed.

26:59.830 --> 26:59.950
Right.

27:00.098 --> 27:11.155
By the way, in that autograph there, and that is coming up, there's a letter address to police, and the return address is fantastic.

27:11.506 --> 27:14.869
What do you feel when you hold something in?

27:14.889 --> 27:17.431
Because you can't tell them, you know, that there's not magic.

27:17.451 --> 27:27.741
There is magic and, you know, when I was in the Blue Collection holding Virginia Woolf's Diaries and select for the end paper, you know, I opened it up and it did it nice.

27:27.761 --> 27:32.745
Well, I wanted a page where, yet again, she's making another resolution about something about writing.

27:32.825 --> 27:40.332
So here she is in August 1923 saying, yet again, this time I'm going to try to write with, as opposed to against the grain.

27:40.312 --> 28:00.109
What I love is not only hardiness, but seeing, just like Samuel Johnson, that every writer is constantly giving themselves pep talks all the way through, no matter how famous they are, they use their diaries as much after they've been published to meditate on fame and envy and all sorts of things.

28:00.089 --> 28:26.793
but they become remarkable adjuncts to creative life, and that's what I love about them.

28:26.813 --> 28:30.096
I think what's happening with technology is sort of what I do for the epilogue,

28:30.076 --> 28:40.424
We're wired to corruption, and there are a lot of people writing, and what people want is the kind of uninterrupted time.

28:40.444 --> 28:45.418
They want solitude, which is one of the reasons that the Journal of Solitude is still a topic.

28:45.398 --> 29:00.997
in Japan at the moment, it's a country without any solitude, and they find in May Sarton, they find in May Sarton, you know, the absolute significance of their life.

29:01.017 --> 29:02.118
What do they have?

29:02.138 --> 29:10.929
You know, here's a woman who is supposedly by herself in New Hampshire and in Maine, with time to write and inventing a life of solitude.

29:11.029 --> 29:13.752
The people who loved the book most were women with two children.

29:13.732 --> 29:20.482
But to get back to this question about technology, I think it's been a couple of things.

29:20.703 --> 29:27.834
I think the technology is very alienating, and I think that diaries are a way that people come back to some sense of real self-reflection.

29:28.014 --> 29:32.300
Also, because of the technology, our lives are fragmented.

29:32.320 --> 29:42.456
Diaries are the literature of interrupted life, and I think that it is the one form that people...

29:43.178 --> 29:49.247
I mean, excuse me to say about that, but anyway, that people come back now to use the diary.

29:49.267 --> 29:58.059
It's the only time, it's the only literary form or form of internal reflection that people have time for.

29:58.080 --> 30:01.204
But also there is a kind of connection to, I think,

30:01.184 --> 30:04.927
technology for the amount of men who have journals.

30:05.027 --> 30:08.571
I think we'll say, you know, women are for the diaries, keeping the diaries in men as journals.

30:08.811 --> 30:18.019
But I've just noticed in teaching, for example, memoir writing, that a quarter of the class are men, they all keep some form of a journal.

30:18.039 --> 30:26.467
They start from college on, but the fact that they can keep them uncomputed with a password has allowed a lot of note to do with it.

30:26.767 --> 30:31.191
They don't necessarily tell you initially they're doing it, but they keep journals.

30:31.171 --> 30:39.575
Exactly, that's what I keep, exactly.

30:39.875 --> 30:46.193
No problem.

30:46.173 --> 30:51.360
Well, I delivered 1,000 net loads a day.

30:51.540 --> 30:56.807
How many do you do?

30:57.028 --> 30:59.811
Certainly 1,000.

30:59.832 --> 31:03.016
I told earlier that there was some writer that I interviewed said 1,000 a day.

31:03.116 --> 31:07.502
I said, fine, that's my goal, I can do that.

31:07.522 --> 31:09.204
My columns are 900 to 1,000.

31:09.284 --> 31:12.028
It takes a little longer than that.

31:12.008 --> 31:13.876
Well, I can do that.

31:13.956 --> 31:14.820
Not words.

31:15.322 --> 31:20.061
I mean, the first word process allows us to count the words, but I can't do that.

31:20.294 --> 31:26.103
So what I would keep alive, and what I would start for this long, it would be more than that.

31:26.223 --> 31:28.807
It wasn't just the whole thing like Ms.

31:28.907 --> 31:30.089
Dr. J. standing in.

31:30.169 --> 31:31.310
I would say what I'm doing.

31:31.411 --> 31:41.846
There's got to be long entries in why something I was having a problem with, angrier, just whatever it were I'm studying.

31:41.986 --> 31:45.171
It was kind of like a beginning exercise.

31:45.151 --> 31:52.918
So many of these writers used their diaries for exactly that as a five-finger exit as a way to get going, to warn them for writing.

31:52.938 --> 31:58.223
Or somebody like Woolf used it at the end of the day when she'd released the internal critic.

31:58.283 --> 32:10.334
She had the diary propped on her knee after tea and wrote, as she said of that, a haphazard gallop to try to find the diamonds in the dust heap because the internal critic had been relaxed.

32:10.354 --> 32:15.158
But it was impossible not to use these as sketchbooks, all of them.

32:15.138 --> 32:31.370
But then you have somebody like Thoreau who, as you know, wrote two million words in his 39 notebooks, you know, peeling off Birkbarge when he didn't walk into his office because he needed paper to write something down, whose friends complained that... It's about a big pencil.

32:31.390 --> 32:32.813
...in the Concord Library.

32:32.853 --> 32:34.295
Have you ever seen them?

32:34.315 --> 32:34.656
It is lovely.

32:34.676 --> 32:36.640
The Concord Library is going to be in my own book.

32:36.620 --> 32:39.664
I love that library.

32:39.724 --> 32:40.945
I love that library.

32:41.025 --> 32:41.506
Me too.

32:41.586 --> 32:42.267
It's in my book.

32:42.287 --> 32:43.308
It's going to be in the new book.

32:43.468 --> 32:43.829
Excellent.

32:43.889 --> 32:46.552
Libraries, Franklin Libraries.

32:47.132 --> 32:51.017
I'm so glad to come to you.

32:51.137 --> 32:57.244
I actually love to get a library card in the Concord, and they said, oh, we live in Medford, and that's already part of the chain.

32:57.385 --> 33:00.248
But I wanted to make a Concord Public Library.

33:00.413 --> 33:02.055
It disturbs me.

33:02.416 --> 33:06.763
I've read certain places and they don't give me a card.

33:06.783 --> 33:07.564
I want a card.

33:07.584 --> 33:08.185
I want a card.

33:08.305 --> 33:09.286
I want a card.

33:09.407 --> 33:10.829
I remember here.

33:11.189 --> 33:18.220
I keep all, for all the libraries that I had to go, I keep it, even if it's like a week pass,

33:18.200 --> 33:19.442
all of these things.

33:19.542 --> 33:21.566
The National Library of Scotland, I mean all of these.

33:21.887 --> 33:24.251
Well, Houlton doesn't give you one.

33:24.552 --> 33:26.555
I know, I know.

33:26.675 --> 33:32.366
But I think the library is a nice one.

33:32.566 --> 33:35.331
It's very important for you to handle the real stuff.

33:35.615 --> 33:43.377
I have a lot to say about that.

33:47.068 --> 33:49.675
First of all, it's just the

33:50.532 --> 34:06.623
a wide variety of how people kept journalism and everything from little pocket books to Virginia Woolf kept diaries that her sister did the marbleized paper for and each year was different.

34:06.643 --> 34:11.933
Someone like Mae Sarton dictated at the end, her entries into a sunny paper corridor because she

34:11.913 --> 34:14.296
you can build by illness, so all of those are types.

34:14.316 --> 34:16.239
You just see this whole variety.

34:16.259 --> 34:21.465
But for me, part of it also was to see where people wrote.

34:21.665 --> 34:25.010
The diary is the fact that it's portable.

34:25.671 --> 34:26.852
They wrote everywhere.

34:26.872 --> 34:33.460
This is something they brought with them, like a small oxygen tank, you feel, to kind of keep the idea going.

34:34.221 --> 34:36.304
But it was important to hold all these things.

34:36.444 --> 34:39.388
I felt that it linked me

34:39.892 --> 34:46.864
to writers who I've loved, and the same way that they read all the diaries that preceded them.

34:46.884 --> 34:50.671
So people read backwards in order to move themselves forward.

34:50.952 --> 35:03.975
But there's something about holding these diaries, and including, you know, going to UCLA to the rare book collection of the Niased Means diaries, because I had to find out

35:04.411 --> 35:12.897
if in fact the first volume that was published in the 60s bore no relationship to The Real Diary, and it doesn't.

35:14.261 --> 35:15.886
It bears no relationship.

35:15.987 --> 35:17.712
And one of the couple things,

35:18.248 --> 35:27.784
It taught me how much she learned to invent herself as a writer and her daughters because she kept rewriting them and rewriting.

35:27.804 --> 35:30.208
The first volume that came out in the 60s is extremely well written.

35:30.228 --> 35:34.254
It's really essentially one of the first one of the early memoirs.

35:34.875 --> 35:36.718
But she's done it in the form of a diary.

35:36.959 --> 35:39.683
You point out that Chris O'Connor is successful.

35:39.663 --> 35:41.708
So she was no full she.

35:41.728 --> 35:42.770
Oh, no full she.

35:42.791 --> 35:45.918
She's the most commercially successful diarist of the 20th century.

35:45.958 --> 35:48.705
Maybe it's not really a diary.

35:48.865 --> 35:49.807
It's not.

35:50.048 --> 35:50.529
It's not.

35:50.649 --> 35:57.165
And I think the other thing too, that collection is so crazy because it's kept under lock and key that you have to get

35:57.584 --> 36:04.495
special permission to even go into the collection from her second husband.

36:04.515 --> 36:12.067
This is like the second bigamous husband group of poems out in Los Angeles, who said, you know, yes, you can do it.

36:12.087 --> 36:14.330
Then he gave me access to sort of everything.

36:14.390 --> 36:20.700
Her early galleries read like most people's, like I did this today, and they're not very interesting.

36:20.720 --> 36:23.625
But then as you go on the years, as she's rewriting them,

36:23.605 --> 36:25.468
The writing gets so much better.

36:25.608 --> 36:26.950
She starts to find a story.

36:27.130 --> 36:29.554
All of a sudden, we have Henry Miller showing up.

36:29.574 --> 36:35.923
All of a sudden, she frames this as a kind of menage a trois.

36:35.983 --> 36:38.127
This becomes part of that first volume.

36:38.147 --> 36:44.256
And I remember reading these in college and being very disturbed, thinking, how does she support herself?

36:44.276 --> 36:49.263
You know, she always seems to have a lot of men in the photographs, but she seems to always be by herself.

36:49.303 --> 36:53.089
So when we found out what was really going on in the life,

36:53.069 --> 36:57.575
I felt, I didn't feel betrayed in the way that so many people did.

36:57.655 --> 37:05.265
I just thought, this is hilarious, because it was a kind of, she was constantly campaigning for kind of publicity of the self.

37:05.305 --> 37:09.691
Whatever form got out, it was a diary, a memoir, or whatever.

37:10.953 --> 37:12.315
Did you even read this diary?

37:12.435 --> 37:15.499
I didn't, I've read them, but I've never seen them.

37:15.519 --> 37:18.102
I remember when the diaries and the letters came out at about the same time.

37:18.123 --> 37:20.005
I forget what they said, one of them.

37:19.985 --> 37:22.248
I forget whether it was the letters of a diary.

37:22.368 --> 37:27.276
I think the diaries were written very well and the letters were unreadable.

37:27.476 --> 37:35.287
And they said the reason was he did the diary in the morning when he was sober and he wrote the letters at night when he was sober.

37:35.568 --> 37:39.133
Well, also, he had such an laugh about social persona.

37:39.253 --> 37:42.077
One of my favorite wall stories, you probably know this, and I forget who the writer was.

37:42.057 --> 37:52.711
I don't know who the writer was, but there was a writer about to do a reading and he had a hard time hearing, put down his ear trumpet from the guy started to read.

37:53.091 --> 37:59.019
So I think that his diary I do believe that was better written.

37:59.439 --> 38:09.432
What I love about your book too is that it just so flies in the face of this

38:09.412 --> 38:17.082
concept that we should go by the text of the book.

38:17.142 --> 38:19.886
That the biography and the other stuff is irrelevant.

38:19.906 --> 38:20.907
No, no, no.

38:20.947 --> 38:23.991
That's been pretty much discredited.

38:24.011 --> 38:24.772
I hope it has.

38:24.932 --> 38:32.382
I hope it has because one of the things when we talk about this is why I love so many of the working notebooks of Kafka or

38:32.362 --> 38:34.585
Fitzgerald, that they left out the life.

38:34.806 --> 38:41.596
And I wanted to know, I don't think that you can talk about literary creativity without wanting to know a lot about the life somewhere.

38:41.616 --> 38:43.559
And in these other diaries, it was there.

38:44.641 --> 38:45.823
It was quickly there.

38:45.843 --> 38:52.233
Any great surprises for you once it became a work in progress, once it became a project?

38:52.774 --> 38:55.438
About the actual diary themselves?

38:55.458 --> 38:56.379
Yeah.

38:56.680 --> 38:59.584
Discoveries in the course of the university.

38:59.564 --> 39:09.355
I think just how these diaries liberated their writers to become better writers, ironically, how the diaries stopped

39:10.769 --> 39:13.912
just the self-reflection that became literary.

39:13.932 --> 39:23.923
The other thing is that there's not a single diary, including my group, I mean, who didn't expect that her diaries were going to be read afterwards.

39:23.943 --> 39:30.430
And so they used the diary as an audience and the writer herself.

39:30.990 --> 39:38.278
And that was, I wonder if it's possible to keep a diary without thinking...

39:40.148 --> 39:50.469
I just wonder if it's possible to keep a diary without wanting somebody to read it on some level.

39:50.489 --> 39:57.904
Alice James started to address this as the dear unknown.

39:58.475 --> 40:03.702
You know that the intention there is that, and I bet you noticed that the writing gets a lot better.

40:03.722 --> 40:05.004
The writing gets much better.

40:05.024 --> 40:10.151
I think the other thing that I love, though, that I found out is how dangerous diaries keeping is.

40:10.171 --> 40:25.292
You know, we know that Henry burned his copy of Alice's diary, Thomas Carlisle burned Jane's, and one of the few things that's left in her diaries is how she records after a duchess has been murdered, the man, the husband, saying something like,

40:25.272 --> 40:29.821
You know, what could a man do with a woman who kept a wife who kept a diary but murdered her?

40:29.841 --> 40:45.492
So we have, you know, a lot of instances where people needed to burn the diaries, which is again coming back to Anne Frank, why I think there's an incredible poignant intention in the fact that this exists, because most diaries do not.

40:45.674 --> 40:52.463
Did you read Ann Michaels' novel, The Future of Pieces?

40:52.483 --> 40:54.246
I'm so behind it.

40:54.406 --> 40:57.030
I'm like about 20 years behind it.

40:57.170 --> 41:03.058
And they were Ryan at 9 and then Robert Hughes at 11.

41:03.078 --> 41:04.961
Two of my favorite writers.

41:04.981 --> 41:05.561
I love them.

41:05.782 --> 41:10.348
And this weekend is spent.

41:10.328 --> 41:14.393
I love Edna Bryant and I love Robert Hughes, actually.

41:14.553 --> 41:15.934
I've never entered Hughes before.

41:15.954 --> 41:17.976
This will be a little bit poor thing to do for Brian.

41:18.197 --> 41:20.740
Well, bring about 10 taper footage for Hughes.

41:21.480 --> 41:22.542
He's so cool.

41:22.702 --> 41:23.743
Yeah, he's wired.

41:23.763 --> 41:26.486
Yeah, he's wired.

41:26.606 --> 41:29.129
I'm sorry, go ahead.

41:29.309 --> 41:30.070
I interrupted.

41:30.090 --> 41:30.671
It's terrible.

41:31.071 --> 41:33.754
You just had a...

41:34.122 --> 41:35.985
You worked for the Christian Science Foundation.

41:36.125 --> 41:38.148
You interviewed many, many authors.

41:38.308 --> 41:43.174
Did this kind of fire your enthusiasm for this project?

41:43.255 --> 41:43.996
It did.

41:44.737 --> 41:45.538
Two things.

41:45.798 --> 41:48.001
I started out as a book reviewer.

41:48.021 --> 41:52.227
I started out as a book reviewer and a literary essayist.

41:52.748 --> 41:56.012
My whole idea was to try to find out how to become a writer.

41:55.992 --> 41:57.473
So there were two ways to do it.

41:57.493 --> 42:05.220
First of all, I noticed that there were huge amounts of diaries being published in the late 70s, and that's part of what sparked this project.

42:05.580 --> 42:11.726
And I knew there were a lot of people hungry for information about creative life, but I was one of them.

42:11.806 --> 42:15.609
So one of the things that I did, as you know as a journalist, is you have licensed audacity.

42:15.649 --> 42:20.333
You can just call up a publisher and say, I'd like to interview Zinger or whoever.

42:20.994 --> 42:22.735
Let me tell you some cute stories.

42:22.755 --> 42:25.037
There are people that I can't get on my own for my book.

42:25.523 --> 42:28.046
Can I just wait until I have your own book coming up?

42:28.267 --> 42:29.989
I really want Maurice Sunder.

42:30.069 --> 42:30.730
Oh, yeah.

42:30.830 --> 42:32.212
Oh, he's impossible.

42:32.593 --> 42:33.414
But he'll do an interview.

42:33.434 --> 42:36.879
But he's doing something this fall, and I really want him.

42:36.899 --> 42:38.721
He's a major collector.

42:38.741 --> 42:40.784
Major collector.

42:40.804 --> 42:42.146
And collected.

42:42.366 --> 42:43.668
And collected equipment.

42:43.688 --> 42:46.392
The stuff that he knows influences his work.

42:46.512 --> 42:48.034
I mean, I remember the story true.

42:48.555 --> 42:52.320
He actually went and spent the night and got permission to sleep in all of those books.

42:53.381 --> 42:54.703
Now, is that a great story?

42:55.038 --> 43:01.025
See, I think it's like Flaubert's carrot, you know, it's the kind of fixation we all have.

43:01.045 --> 43:08.814
And I know when I would go interview these writers, part of it really was to ask them the kind of Paris review questions.

43:09.535 --> 43:13.239
Of the level, do you use a typewriter or a pen?

43:14.781 --> 43:16.944
I wanted to know all those habits.

43:16.964 --> 43:24.893
And, you know, essentially what I kept trying to find in diaries was practical as well as literary as well as spiritual kind of information.

43:25.531 --> 43:28.698
And so that's what I also tried to get from these profiles.

43:29.119 --> 43:30.161
It was wonderful.

43:30.181 --> 43:31.644
That's why I do it.

43:31.684 --> 43:32.025
Yeah.

43:32.105 --> 43:33.067
Oh, it's the best life.

43:33.408 --> 43:36.013
It's a door for the money of the thing.

43:36.033 --> 43:41.565
I do it for the... But anyway, I love meeting the authors.

43:41.815 --> 43:45.200
and my collection is unique.

43:45.580 --> 43:48.544
I mean, I, in a way, embrace the authors.

43:48.664 --> 43:51.308
I meet them, and then I write about them.

43:51.388 --> 43:51.889
Exactly.

43:52.209 --> 43:56.815
How do people consider you a collection that buys an office who you've met?

43:56.876 --> 44:11.215
And also that each one spawns like 20 others, you know, where you say, I mean, I have all sorts of people that, you know, first of all, you have to kind of, you know, as I keep tediously saying, but my husband will be a rich vein for a lot of the things you're doing, and just a love of

44:11.549 --> 44:15.173
a deep, deep collector.

44:15.293 --> 44:18.496
Again, this new book is, I hope, going beyond the collection.

44:18.516 --> 44:19.217
Oh, no, no, I know.

44:19.477 --> 44:19.878
No, I know.

44:20.098 --> 44:21.139
It's people who love books.

44:21.239 --> 44:22.741
We are great book lovers.

44:22.901 --> 44:37.236
But I think the thing, too, and this is an awful thing to say, but I think that the market is such that people think, well, the whole shift in publishing, we're only interested in kind of memoir, we're interested in

44:37.486 --> 44:48.779
The thing that I find so fascinating in terms of memoir, a couple of things, the very secrets have been locked up for centuries.

44:48.799 --> 44:58.250
Now people comb their diaries with an eye of writing memoir, and so diaries instead of seeing as something locked up are in fact something that are a stepping stone to writing.

44:58.510 --> 45:05.839
But just the whole thing that when you go out and do readings, the amount of real

45:06.764 --> 45:09.648
lovers of writing, love reading.

45:09.728 --> 45:17.237
I mean, at the book on Dick Smith the other night, there were a hundred people who wanted us to hear about dialogue, to hear about the rate of life.

45:17.578 --> 45:27.230
You know, and that's... And we're talking, we're not all talking, I mean, this is everybody from, you know, I'd say people in their early 20s through their late 60s.

45:27.951 --> 45:33.498
And I think that the, you know, the market underestimates the intelligent reader out there.

45:33.718 --> 45:35.100
That's in New York.

45:35.637 --> 45:50.571
You know, I keep saying when I, you know, just before reading that no book comes into the world alone.

45:50.671 --> 45:52.993
It's helped by many other people.

45:53.334 --> 45:57.057
But I kept taking up this book from Wagner.

45:57.077 --> 46:02.202
And when I noticed whether it was a book on Marjorie Fleming's diaries,

46:02.502 --> 46:12.556
that the book plate all came from the same family, from Lucy Osgood.

46:12.676 --> 46:18.324
And then I noticed that Lucy Osgood lived in Medford, Massachusetts, where I lived.

46:18.784 --> 46:23.491
Not to publish her, Osgood.

46:23.972 --> 46:27.096
So I thought, I'm going to find out who Lucy Osgood was.

46:27.256 --> 46:28.678
Lucy Osgood,

46:28.658 --> 46:34.064
was the daughter of a Unitarian minister.

46:34.245 --> 46:38.930
It was the place that Emerson later went and visited.

46:39.811 --> 46:49.843
Lucy Osgood was self-taught by her father, you know, Greek, Latin, five languages, because I found this out later researching here in the library.

46:49.963 --> 46:54.008
But she grew up a century-plus

46:54.157 --> 47:15.777
ago five blocks from me she was an old maid she left the tonic network at the library she left in her will uh 30 acres for the library and she left her book now the weird thing is her fund was used for very eclectic

47:15.757 --> 47:20.543
All of them were the subjects in my book.

47:20.563 --> 47:28.332
There was one for Marjorie Fleming, one for Samia Tolstoy, and there was something else for the book.

47:28.352 --> 47:31.236
And then I went to look at them.

47:31.436 --> 47:32.157
I found them.

47:32.177 --> 47:35.301
I wanted a computer and found them at Osgood.

47:35.321 --> 47:36.162
There were two sisters.

47:36.614 --> 47:37.896
I looked up Lucy.

47:38.016 --> 47:44.446
Lucy has, she's in Weidler, somebody who did her funeral oration, a minister.

47:44.547 --> 47:49.154
And she was this remarkable hidden writer, five blocks from me.

47:49.935 --> 48:04.258
And I felt like Lucy Osgood, who sat writing five blocks from me in Medford, left money that was going to allow me to find books that I could use to write this book.

48:04.660 --> 48:08.325
It's as if, you know, you talk about the box coming back and forth.

48:08.426 --> 48:18.741
It really gave me the chills because I kept thinking... These were book themes, you know, the Auschwitz were.

48:18.761 --> 48:21.846
They were two spinster sisters.

48:23.728 --> 48:28.636
Their father, Gondel Harvey, was a minister.

48:28.756 --> 48:29.537
So somebody...

48:29.517 --> 48:44.755
sad, through boring New England days, writing, wanting to be a writer, leaving her books, and then a century plus later, five blocks away, that legacy would help me write my book.

48:44.915 --> 48:47.038
Yeah, wonderful.

48:47.058 --> 48:56.929
At the Concord Public Library, they have books, and I can't think of the woman's name, but she was the first kindergarten, you know what I mean?

48:56.949 --> 48:58.050
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

48:58.070 --> 48:59.372
Right, right.

48:59.352 --> 49:05.621
gave her books, and they had her books.

49:05.641 --> 49:06.302
That's one very early.

49:06.322 --> 49:13.071
You know, also you mentioned finding books in the library that were circulating, signed by duet nomes.

49:13.091 --> 49:17.897
Up until 20 years ago, they have all of Emerson's and fellow's books.

49:17.917 --> 49:21.542
They were in general circulation.

49:22.584 --> 49:24.887
And somebody stole Emerson's copy of all of them.

49:24.867 --> 49:36.413
It showed up that it was going to go for like $150,000, and that's when they discovered it was out of the library.

49:36.433 --> 49:36.754
It's not a fact.

49:36.774 --> 49:38.177
This is now on this floor.

49:38.197 --> 49:42.066
Can you imagine how big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big.

49:42.046 --> 49:45.670
in general circulation.

49:45.690 --> 49:56.323
Well, his son's was, you know, a Jewish copy of his son's book was in general circulation in Lamont.

49:56.644 --> 50:04.774
Gee, actually, Columbia has this, they've just created a new designation of a book, which is cute, but they call it non-new rare.

50:04.934 --> 50:07.497
Well, I mean, what you described are rare books, but books that,

50:07.477 --> 50:26.513
They're really not real books, but they're old books, and they're falling apart, and they're in circulation, and maybe we don't want the students to take them out and grab a seal, and they have to read it here.

50:26.533 --> 50:29.900
If you want a zero object, they'll make an individual decision on whether or not they're allowed it, so maybe they're actually designated these books as a medium layer.

50:29.920 --> 50:30.160
I love that.

50:30.140 --> 50:37.309
I love the detectives that go into all of this.

50:37.329 --> 50:52.769
And one of the great things about having a wonderful library here is when I, you know, nobody's ever heard of Marjorie Fleming, you know, she is Twain's and Stevenson's favorite goddess, but nobody's heard of her.

50:52.789 --> 50:55.152
All the people surrounding her, all the books that she gave to her, all the books,

50:55.132 --> 51:02.443
that were around her story, all in open shelves.

51:02.463 --> 51:16.183
And I just loved doing, you know, I went to Scotland doing a lot of detective work, and a lot of it I ended up having to do just in my own backyard here, because they had all the books here.

51:16.384 --> 51:20.370
Oh, I think that's a lot of money.

51:20.390 --> 51:21.291
That means 90% of my money.

51:21.271 --> 51:25.517
I love your quote early on.

51:25.537 --> 51:29.822
Is this a quote that you get from Bellow a writer as a reader?

51:29.842 --> 51:30.223
Emulation, yeah.

51:30.343 --> 51:32.105
This is something I remember reading.

51:32.586 --> 51:36.131
I stole it from something else.

51:36.151 --> 51:36.952
Isn't it wonderful?

51:36.972 --> 51:41.778
And that is my story.

51:41.798 --> 51:44.882
It's the story of all the writers in this book.

51:44.862 --> 52:03.201
It is what I suspect who will read this book, people who are interested in creativity, who may be readers, but don't know that they're possibly writers as well.

52:03.221 --> 52:05.706
You know, I did, you mentioned Betsy Lerner, I guess she's on that issue, by chance related to Bertha Lerner, you know.

52:05.686 --> 52:08.650
I don't know.

52:08.670 --> 52:12.755
I haven't seen the last one.

52:12.775 --> 52:15.279
My husband is guarding me spiritually.

52:15.319 --> 52:19.104
He takes a long time.

52:19.124 --> 52:32.942
You get the thrill of history of your own as well as where you are and the continual history.

52:32.922 --> 52:38.865
You know, one of the things that I'm always not surprised by when you go to antiquarian book shows,

52:39.115 --> 52:42.779
that you look at the prices of ordinary journals.

52:43.219 --> 52:46.202
They're sometimes thousands and thousands of dollars.

52:46.643 --> 52:48.605
What is it that, what are we really buying?

52:48.625 --> 52:52.329
We're buying a life that sort of existed.

52:52.349 --> 52:58.796
I mean, there's something about, if this were written, if that same boring journal were published, nobody'd buy it.

52:58.816 --> 53:04.802
But there's something about holding it.

53:04.782 --> 53:18.474
Why do you suppose the University of Texas with their life out of one of these little, not books, but manuscripts, why did all the people Xerox them by their own pure selfishness?

53:18.574 --> 53:22.678
To maintain the value.

53:22.798 --> 53:27.442
Michael Holwood had his friend, all of the sharp stuff is there.

53:27.603 --> 53:30.865
And he wouldn't do any copies for the end.

53:30.886 --> 53:34.789
He wouldn't spend two or three weeks in Austin for months.

53:34.769 --> 53:43.709
Well, that place, that place is, I mean, talk about the reverse British Empire, you know, just brought up all literary Britain.

53:43.729 --> 53:47.016
That's one of my favorite chapters in that book.

53:47.096 --> 53:50.063
The Institute of New Guinea-Orania chapter.

53:50.083 --> 53:50.584
Yeah, but I'm curious.

53:50.564 --> 54:09.714
It's amazing that they allowed that to happen down there.

54:09.975 --> 54:15.964
Like they gave him free reigns.

54:16.265 --> 54:17.688
Well, thank God.

54:17.708 --> 54:17.968
Oh, yeah.

54:17.989 --> 54:18.530
Thank you.

54:18.550 --> 54:19.351
Great.

54:19.371 --> 54:21.115
I think we have a lot of subject to this.

54:21.295 --> 54:22.438
Yes, I will.

54:22.538 --> 54:24.802
I will carry my own pants.

54:25.845 --> 54:30.133
I hope you don't get anything.

54:30.334 --> 54:33.039
And you must say, tell me from your taste.

54:33.059 --> 54:35.404
If I ever need a question about how hard you are.
