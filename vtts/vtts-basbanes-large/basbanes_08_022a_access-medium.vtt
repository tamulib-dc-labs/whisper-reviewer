WEBVTT

00:03.136 --> 00:06.201
I've been doing this for many years.

00:06.341 --> 00:10.268
I've never had a complaint.

00:10.688 --> 00:17.680
Ben Bradley was joined by Tom Winship, my manager.

00:17.700 --> 00:18.281
Your manager?

00:18.301 --> 00:19.623
I like you're a fighter.

00:19.683 --> 00:25.693
Do you know what the first printing of the... It's up to a hundred and they've gone back.

00:25.833 --> 00:27.776
They don't do printings the way they used to.

00:27.796 --> 00:28.738
I think they printed

00:28.938 --> 00:33.526
85, then they printed five more, then five more, and then 20 more.

00:34.027 --> 00:38.896
But, you know, it's just reserving an hour on a press.

00:38.916 --> 00:40.979
It isn't that big a deal.

00:42.562 --> 00:45.968
But I think there's 120 in print now.

00:45.948 --> 00:47.931
Congratulations, that's wonderful.

00:48.011 --> 00:49.774
Fabulous, wouldn't it?

00:50.014 --> 00:52.038
You've been paid.

00:53.019 --> 00:53.880
I've been paid.

00:54.341 --> 00:57.206
So theoretically, there's nothing different.

00:57.286 --> 01:02.154
I'd have to sell a hell of a lot of copies to get any more dough out of it.

01:02.254 --> 01:03.676
To earn out, as they say.

01:04.617 --> 01:11.989
But now, you know, you suddenly start and you say, Jesus, I wonder how close you can come to Powell.

01:11.969 --> 01:16.815
Yes, nice to see you.

01:17.437 --> 01:19.660
I'm sorry we weren't able to get together in Washington.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.102
I was down a couple weeks ago.

01:21.122 --> 01:21.602
Oh, you were?

01:21.642 --> 01:24.105
We were going to try and sign up a thing in your office.

01:24.666 --> 01:26.408
You could have done that.

01:26.428 --> 01:28.351
I couldn't get an earlier flight down.

01:28.371 --> 01:30.313
I was signing my own book in Washington.

01:30.333 --> 01:30.934
What did you do?

01:30.974 --> 01:35.139
Back to talking about Ben Brown.

01:35.159 --> 01:35.940
It's interesting.

01:35.960 --> 01:42.468
As a former naval officer myself, I noticed that you coach your fitness reports.

01:43.149 --> 01:45.152
They really do mean a lot, don't they?

01:45.172 --> 01:45.452
They do.

01:45.432 --> 02:07.643
and there's something about all of us that we look for evidence evidence of effectiveness you know really any goddamn good and never mind all the things you told yourself or your friends told you but were you anyway what's the record show you cast any shadow at all and uh for a while there i had that job that took me all around and i thought

02:08.062 --> 02:13.013
Manning cuffs me a little for writing too many of them.

02:15.157 --> 02:17.121
I like that review though.

02:17.202 --> 02:21.150
I thought Bob Manning did a nice job with that review.

02:21.170 --> 02:27.724
He should have said that he's mad as hell at me because the Washington Post never reviewed his book.

02:27.704 --> 02:52.227
that's right and most other people well he was mad as hell and dad and he thought that i could have fixed that nothing they can do you know you go to a book review a book editor and say i want you to review this thing they'll say they'll find a way not to do it he should know better than anybody his wife his stuff isn't he isn't my book editor because she knew how that worked anyway

02:52.493 --> 02:57.644
You were at your black shoe sale, 19 tin cans, I guess.

02:57.744 --> 03:03.616
19 tin cans the last year and one for two, two and a half years, yeah.

03:03.636 --> 03:06.482
It's quite an experience, isn't it?

03:07.264 --> 03:09.709
I remember it.

03:09.689 --> 03:17.036
Well, you know, I majored in Greek at Harvard College and, you know, I would have farted around after, you know, without a war.

03:17.056 --> 03:18.958
What the hell would we all have done?

03:19.639 --> 03:27.626
I mean, he and his dad was a journalist, and he knew that he wanted to be, but I didn't know that.

03:27.726 --> 03:32.131
Well, you and I wrote letters of hate killers.

03:32.151 --> 03:32.871
You can't hire us.

03:32.891 --> 03:33.432
You ought to be a wife.

03:33.452 --> 03:35.374
Well, I don't think we ever got an answer, did we?

03:35.394 --> 03:35.494
Well,

03:35.845 --> 03:37.728
I mean, you had that locked.

03:37.989 --> 03:40.212
I didn't, I was just wanting in on it.

03:40.873 --> 03:41.274
That's right.

03:41.334 --> 03:44.159
We wrote the owner of the, I've forgotten that.

03:45.501 --> 03:48.045
The owner of the Globe, but his dad was editor.

03:49.267 --> 03:55.457
Hire both of us and open a bureau and we'll cover it the way it ought to be covered.

03:55.910 --> 04:19.133
you know in your final paragraph that's the last draft in the book you say i miss the excitement of the stories that quicken your pulse what what kind of a story would quicken your pulse right now that would kind of induce you to leave the farm and well it would be and it's everything from the

04:19.568 --> 04:30.115
from what's happening to Colin Powell now, that's really an interesting story, to something like a Lorena Bobbitt story.

04:30.336 --> 04:33.223
Oh yeah, I love that story.

04:33.912 --> 04:49.816
How badly we cover the economy and the middle of the SNL business.

04:49.836 --> 04:51.619
It's hard to make up.

04:51.639 --> 04:53.081
Sexy, that story.

04:54.683 --> 04:55.785
The economy.

04:56.086 --> 04:59.631
That's also the most important step.

04:59.651 --> 05:01.433
It boars people, though.

05:01.453 --> 05:02.494
But it boars people.

05:02.595 --> 05:07.581
I noticed the New York Times just finally put in the A.J.

05:07.741 --> 05:09.564
Simpson story on page one.

05:09.584 --> 05:11.026
That boars me now.

05:11.186 --> 05:13.890
In the next two days it won't.

05:13.950 --> 05:20.158
How would you treat that story if those murders had taken place in Washington?

05:20.178 --> 05:23.342
You point out quite correctly that

05:23.322 --> 05:28.790
We'd have been all over it, and we'd have over-covered it as... Really?

05:28.810 --> 05:30.652
Like, newspapers over-cover things.

05:30.672 --> 05:31.554
Don't you think?

05:31.594 --> 05:32.815
Oh, yeah, yeah.

05:32.835 --> 05:34.458
They just, they hang on to them.

05:34.478 --> 05:39.345
If the Red Sox get in the World Series, it's covered as if it was a second comic book.

05:39.365 --> 05:39.485
Yeah.

05:39.505 --> 05:45.313
But the reason I mention it is you mentioned kerosene journalism and the slaves of the tabloids.

05:45.293 --> 06:03.150
but i wonder i stole that place from somebody and i can't remember who the hell i stole it it's a great line i wonder how you how you'd cover that story would it be a local story for you the oj story well it would be everything i mean it's uh

06:03.383 --> 06:05.607
Because I understand that's all they talk about out in L.A.

06:05.648 --> 06:06.109
is O.J.

06:06.189 --> 06:06.489
Simpson.

06:06.509 --> 06:09.135
Well, it's Tim.

06:09.155 --> 06:12.481
You're all they talked about in Washington for a while.

06:12.501 --> 06:17.231
It's on every television station.

06:17.411 --> 06:20.979
I don't apologize for over-covering.

06:20.999 --> 06:23.704
I bet you we covered the Washington Post covered the...

06:25.051 --> 06:31.842
The Redskins victory over Dallas yesterday, I bet it's on fans one and all over the place.

06:32.263 --> 06:35.348
Well, the Patriots got their asses kicked.

06:35.468 --> 06:38.332
A little trouble, huh?

06:38.352 --> 06:42.639
Can you guys come with that?

06:42.739 --> 06:47.267
I have two famous editors here at the same table.

06:47.307 --> 06:51.193
I wonder, in your view, what elevates a great editor?

06:51.511 --> 07:15.409
I thought we'd say the same thing a great owner But you can't do it

07:15.389 --> 07:20.338
So what do you make of that piece in the New York Times this morning about Long Island News Day?

07:20.459 --> 07:23.384
Oh, I haven't read the Times, I'm sorry, this morning.

07:23.404 --> 07:31.660
They're really losing all their... They offered this buyout, you know, when they closed the New York News Day, and then they're also scaling down the rest of the pages.

07:31.640 --> 07:43.276
Yeah, a lot of the really best people are taking the buyout and leaving, and now they're actually trying to spend it.

07:43.876 --> 07:47.501
Did they offer everyone at Newsday or just New York Newsday?

07:49.324 --> 07:53.269
No, no, actually at Newsday on Long Island as well.

07:54.030 --> 07:55.572
Apparently, according to this story,

07:55.552 --> 08:18.319
they want to have a 70 percent profit throughout all of the all of the LA Times papers so that 17 17 percent is the number they had in the paper they said they went from 794 down to 400 I mean it looked like a 250

08:18.552 --> 08:47.530
reduction in uh editorial personnel so that goes back to what you're saying if you have ownership that's not interested in having a great paper you're not going to have it's impossible to be a great editor you know what what 794 you'd have to read this number i mean that's that's uh that's too many people 350 might be too few you know it also helps uh being a halfway decent editor is to have an excess of energy

08:47.510 --> 08:51.349
Physical and, you know, very important.

08:51.369 --> 08:54.465
It's what I look for in people at Lowry.

08:54.698 --> 08:58.363
I always like to see evidences of energy.

08:58.383 --> 08:59.224
What else do they do?

08:59.244 --> 09:06.052
So do you think, Ben, that reporting is a young man's game or a young woman's game?

09:06.072 --> 09:10.438
No, it don't have to be, but energy is vital.

09:10.878 --> 09:21.932
And I don't think that the younger group now is brighter than we are and they write better than we are, but I don't think they have as much energy.

09:21.952 --> 09:23.254
They want to get home.

09:23.622 --> 09:26.312
And that's probably for various reasons.

09:26.352 --> 09:34.965
The women's movement wants the husbands home earlier to do more and the

09:35.165 --> 09:36.907
And that's not bad either.

09:37.347 --> 09:45.937
But when Tom and I were starting in the business, we worked all night.

09:45.957 --> 09:48.319
We worked at each other's houses.

09:48.339 --> 10:02.154
I mean, the number of times that we went to his house or he came to our house with a bottle of a gallon of Mountain Red, and somebody brought spaghetti, and somebody brought the bread, and we all did the dishes.

10:02.174 --> 10:04.817
And we didn't have 10 bucks in the evening.

10:04.797 --> 10:12.732
But, and then, you know, I remember this great, great night that, what, it was at McLaurice.

10:14.275 --> 10:21.468
Well, we had some guy, it's not important, but some young lawyer, because we knew a lot of lawyers and a lot of CIA people.

10:22.129 --> 10:27.379
And they, they would, the CIA people wouldn't talk, but the lawyers would talk about their clients.

10:27.528 --> 10:37.667
And this guy, Nick Alorek, had a client who was either the Dalai Lama or the son of the Dalai Lama or something.

10:37.847 --> 10:40.772
And we went and talked about it.

10:40.812 --> 10:45.621
We had a little seminar about South Asian politics.

10:45.601 --> 10:51.107
Tom tried to teach the Dalai Lama how to sing Fair Harvest.

10:51.127 --> 10:54.430
Can't sing a note himself.

10:54.450 --> 10:59.336
But we waited until, I think we stayed.

10:59.376 --> 11:01.738
We stayed too long, but we worked hard.

11:01.898 --> 11:03.780
At night we worked hard.

11:03.801 --> 11:04.441
That was work.

11:04.501 --> 11:06.583
It was such fun, it's hard to call it work.

11:06.704 --> 11:15.473
You know, you mentioned in your book how much luck has played through the course, not only of your life, but your career being

11:16.010 --> 11:18.358
at the right place at the right time.

11:18.518 --> 11:25.341
I also wonder, why is it that the most successful people are always accused of being lucky?

11:25.421 --> 11:28.973
I wonder how much of that involves intuition too.

11:29.206 --> 11:35.439
Unusual modesty.

11:35.800 --> 11:46.422
Every good politician, a really successful politician, has a fair amount of money.

11:46.402 --> 12:03.010
He said about one of your photographers, was it your photographer, the Harold Stanley Foreman, you know those two Pulitz's?

12:02.990 --> 12:04.532
They say, well, he's always lucky.

12:04.552 --> 12:21.490
Well, why is it that the same people always manage to be at the right place at the right time?

12:21.510 --> 12:22.771
I've still had a lot of luck.

12:23.332 --> 12:26.415
I know what to do with it, maybe.

12:27.475 --> 12:34.323
I was on the goddamn trolley going past the White House when Oscar Colazzo opened fire on Blair House.

12:34.343 --> 12:36.865
Now, that's a lot.

12:37.166 --> 12:37.366
Okay.

12:37.746 --> 12:39.148
Hey, that's a lot.

12:40.109 --> 12:41.911
I remember reading the message.

12:41.931 --> 12:42.612
Yeah, Robert.

12:42.652 --> 12:44.874
I'm so pissed at me because I got a byline that day.

12:46.196 --> 12:49.499
And I'd been on the tape for 20 minutes.

12:49.560 --> 12:50.821
Yeah, what the hell did he do?

12:50.841 --> 12:52.623
I didn't do anything.

12:52.723 --> 12:56.047
I'll wait until you get an order.

12:56.067 --> 12:56.267
I'm sorry.

12:56.635 --> 12:58.720
What are we going to put?

12:58.901 --> 13:00.585
Okay, I'm back on.

13:01.868 --> 13:06.380
I've read the book, of course, so it's foolish to ask you about things that are in the book.

13:07.022 --> 13:10.210
I wish everybody had read the book.

13:10.230 --> 13:12.636
Well, I wonder how many people have asked you, you know,

13:12.886 --> 13:18.739
If you know who Deep Throat is, when you absolutely say that you were told on the stage who Deep Throat is.

13:18.759 --> 13:21.505
But my question for you is, were you surprised when you were told?

13:21.625 --> 13:23.188
No, I don't even want to get into that.

13:23.850 --> 13:23.990
Okay.

13:24.010 --> 13:31.146
Because, you know, let's say, Jesus Christ, if you're surprised, I mean, if he wasn't, that narrows it down a little.

13:31.166 --> 13:31.266
Okay.

13:31.246 --> 13:36.833
Yeah, but it certainly does allow us to enter the larger discussion of sources.

13:37.134 --> 13:37.714
Yeah.

13:37.734 --> 13:40.778
I mean, today you would insist on knowing who the source was.

13:40.839 --> 13:41.920
Well, I think I would.

13:41.940 --> 13:44.343
I bet you Mr. Winship would agree, too.

13:44.724 --> 13:50.671
Yeah, because I got subsequently burnt like hell for not knowing somebody's source.

13:50.771 --> 14:01.185
But the fact of the matter, there were 400 Watergate stories, and the evidence built up quite quickly that their source was right.

14:01.790 --> 14:12.203
And as the reporting went on and other papers like the Globe joined in, we were telling the truth.

14:12.303 --> 14:26.700
And so the identity of the source was, once you knew sort of generically who it was and what position he held and what accent he had,

14:27.727 --> 14:37.480
If this wasn't the highest priority, I think now that I would ask for it earlier, but... But you probably insist on it, you might have... Yeah.

14:37.700 --> 14:42.106
By the way, when has we come to Janet Cook, do you know?

14:42.126 --> 14:52.760
I tried to find her to talk to her, and I found someone who knew her and knew where she was, and asked her, and she refused to talk.

14:53.441 --> 14:54.763
I think she's in Toledo.

14:55.283 --> 14:57.105
That's where she came from.

14:57.126 --> 14:58.007
You're kidding.

14:58.027 --> 14:59.248
Toledo uses me.

14:59.349 --> 15:00.690
I leave their page every week.

15:03.214 --> 15:07.720
She went to Hollywood to try to sell a movie about herself.

15:09.162 --> 15:11.245
Then she got married.

15:11.265 --> 15:15.931
She married a lawyer and went to Paris, worked in Paris for a while.

15:16.372 --> 15:19.476
She worked as a bloomy sales girl over Christmas.

15:21.378 --> 15:24.042
She never fell in the hands.

15:24.477 --> 15:28.663
She tried to sell a movie.

15:28.683 --> 15:32.529
She did try to sell a movie right afterwards.

15:32.549 --> 15:34.412
And we were all outraged at that.

15:34.432 --> 15:36.916
But then she, you're quite right, she disappeared.

15:36.936 --> 15:40.542
And she turned over the page.

15:40.642 --> 15:42.705
I mean, she could have.

15:43.276 --> 15:46.003
I've been a pain on the ass.

15:46.024 --> 15:49.453
She left a step of a nail in my soul, in my foot.

15:49.934 --> 15:51.839
She could have kept it alive.

15:51.879 --> 15:55.750
Being single after wisdom broke, Janet Cook.

15:57.012 --> 16:08.214
All these interviewers, they want to, not you, I'm not talking about you, but they fill Donahue's and they just say, how the hell come about it?

16:08.555 --> 16:09.176
You're supposed to be.

16:09.236 --> 16:10.679
How the hell come about it?

16:10.699 --> 16:15.048
Do you think maybe you were writing the euphoria of the Watergate triumph?

16:15.208 --> 16:15.308
Sure.

16:15.288 --> 16:28.760
This guy here was president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors that year, and he had conned me into being his program chairman.

16:29.441 --> 16:36.628
I think maybe we'd better discuss the... We had these little early morning sessions.

16:36.688 --> 16:39.150
Who really is the hero of that?

16:39.350 --> 16:41.012
Don and Russ.

16:42.013 --> 16:43.354
He called me out of bed.

16:43.334 --> 16:46.539
Saturday morning, she said, you've got the Janet Cook on the program.

16:46.559 --> 16:48.722
She said, I've read the idea.

16:48.742 --> 16:49.864
You said, I'll have to.

16:49.924 --> 16:58.536
No, she said, I've read the idea of having the Janet Cook thing be bathed out in public, but it's the issue of the day.

16:58.657 --> 16:59.778
And she said, you've got them.

16:59.978 --> 17:02.943
I said, Bradley and I've got the program filled up.

17:02.963 --> 17:05.106
She said, you better find a hole for it.

17:05.086 --> 17:08.572
What is it, 700 people showed up?

17:09.333 --> 17:11.036
It's 7.30 in the morning.

17:11.056 --> 17:12.278
Did they bust my balls?

17:12.378 --> 17:17.286
Oh, they bust my balls a little.

17:17.326 --> 17:18.408
Yeah, sure.

17:18.448 --> 17:21.372
Green did a good job.

17:21.392 --> 17:22.254
Who did it?

17:22.274 --> 17:22.715
Zeed?

17:22.735 --> 17:23.676
No, Green.

17:23.736 --> 17:24.638
Remember Green?

17:24.698 --> 17:28.063
Oh, Green did such a great job.

17:28.224 --> 17:32.190
And Zeed was the moderator, I guess.

17:32.407 --> 17:40.341
But, you know, the post was riding perhaps a little too high then, and all these guys.

17:40.743 --> 17:42.926
I just couldn't wait to see that.

17:43.146 --> 17:46.330
It stuck to me and to the post generally.

17:46.690 --> 17:47.752
So we had it coming.

17:47.772 --> 17:50.776
I mean, if you want to look at it, you said you studied Greek at Harvard now.

17:50.796 --> 17:53.859
So you want to put it in classic terms.

17:54.020 --> 18:06.415
I mean, was there a little bit of hubris here, you think, that the tragic flaw of perhaps... I don't know the tragedy, but it was a good exercise.

18:06.575 --> 18:08.097
I'm very glad we did it.

18:08.398 --> 18:08.758
What?

18:08.738 --> 18:25.037
I also say in this book, then if Russ Wiggin, my predecessor, didn't show up and sit right next to me and Don Graham sat next to me with his hand around my shoulders.

18:25.118 --> 18:27.981
I mean, that's an incredible support of Justin.

18:28.001 --> 18:33.868
Well, it's easy to ride with you when you're doing Watergate and the Pentagon Capers and all these other things, but when you have Janet Cook,

18:33.848 --> 18:35.310
That's when you talk to him.

18:35.330 --> 18:40.457
Mr. Winship said, when you have these great owners, that's when you really need to miss that.

18:40.537 --> 18:43.300
Wiggins is one of the great men of our time.

18:43.500 --> 18:49.408
Wiggins kept saying, I'm delighted to learn of the great state of American journalism.

18:49.428 --> 18:51.811
This could only happen in the Washington Post.

18:51.831 --> 18:54.034
It could never happen anywhere else.

18:54.014 --> 18:57.980
Have you heard from him since the book?

18:58.240 --> 18:58.981
I called him.

18:59.001 --> 19:01.265
Yeah.

19:01.285 --> 19:02.226
No, I called him.

19:02.266 --> 19:05.871
You know, he got a heart incident or something, a stroke, I think, in St.

19:05.891 --> 19:07.494
Louis.

19:07.574 --> 19:11.179
I called him about three months ago, two months ago.

19:11.159 --> 19:15.166
And I called him out there, and I stayed in very close touch.

19:15.246 --> 19:15.887
Oh, yeah.

19:15.907 --> 19:17.850
And tried to cheer him up.

19:17.870 --> 19:19.373
I think he's loneliest.

19:19.553 --> 19:22.117
I'm going to see him next week.

19:22.478 --> 19:22.638
Are you?

19:22.658 --> 19:22.798
Yeah.

19:22.818 --> 19:25.282
Tell him I just think of him all the time.

19:25.443 --> 19:25.863
I will.

19:26.304 --> 19:34.838
To go back to the cook matter, do you think that great stories are seductive to the point that maybe you...

19:35.273 --> 19:37.275
You said the woman could write like an angel.

19:37.295 --> 19:38.276
He wrote awful well.

19:38.676 --> 19:39.037
That's it.

19:39.057 --> 19:40.578
It reads like an angel.

19:41.099 --> 19:42.400
That story that I reread it.

19:42.941 --> 19:44.362
Yeah.

19:44.382 --> 19:45.123
The detail.

19:45.283 --> 19:45.964
Oh, shit.

19:45.984 --> 19:47.986
It's wonderful.

19:48.006 --> 19:48.206
Yeah.

19:48.266 --> 19:51.289
And there's nothing there to raise the flag to save the flag.

19:52.030 --> 19:53.071
Well, not that I heard.

19:53.231 --> 19:57.155
I mean, I now read about other people who were worried about it.

19:57.275 --> 20:01.320
A lot of the black men reporters were interested.

20:02.120 --> 20:03.762
But, uh,

20:03.742 --> 20:12.897
I'm just so worried about pouring kerosene on the racial situation at the Washington Post, which is tough enough as it is.

20:13.077 --> 20:23.093
And then you mentioned that she was working on a story about what is a child prostitute, 12-year-old prostitute, and there was nothing to back that up either.

20:23.113 --> 20:28.342
We said we'd like to meet her before we published it.

20:29.523 --> 20:30.525
And she couldn't produce it.

20:30.978 --> 20:32.460
Just this is off of it.

20:32.941 --> 20:37.529
Richie lied about the 8-year-old drunk that she was going to try a 12-year-old hooker.

20:38.550 --> 20:41.795
That's a cliché.

20:41.835 --> 20:45.241
The first lie, Richie, to a lifetime of lies.

20:45.341 --> 20:46.523
I mean, once you do that,

20:46.891 --> 20:52.601
All of a sudden, you have this extraordinary reporter who's able to get these stories.

20:52.661 --> 20:53.884
Now get us some more, right?

20:54.385 --> 20:57.290
She was absolutely striking looking to her.

20:57.931 --> 20:58.793
Oh, gee, she was pretty.

20:59.173 --> 21:00.395
She did to be true, right?

21:02.319 --> 21:02.419
Yeah.

21:02.439 --> 21:02.940
Yeah, that's what I said.

21:02.960 --> 21:03.140
I get it.

21:03.160 --> 21:08.610
It was the answer to an editor's prayer.

21:08.630 --> 21:10.654
Well, I think she's fulfilled a lot of things.

21:10.634 --> 21:15.381
I always remember a headline, a cover line, it actually was.

21:15.401 --> 21:20.149
It was a magazine called Baseball, years and years and years ago.

21:20.169 --> 21:20.830
Did you ever read?

21:21.050 --> 21:22.092
Yeah, I remember.

21:22.112 --> 21:29.183
And there was a picture of a Phillies outfielder called Maury Arnovich.

21:29.163 --> 21:37.606
And the line was, the answer to a manager's prayer for a hard-hitting Jewish outfielder.

21:39.170 --> 21:40.995
Which is wrong on so many levels.

21:41.380 --> 21:46.067
But the answer to an editor's prayer for a simpler world.

21:47.630 --> 21:55.603
When you took over the post, did you mindfully have it in your sights to make this a great paper?

21:55.703 --> 21:57.706
No, not really.

21:57.766 --> 22:00.871
I mean, I always thought the post was pretty good anyway.

22:00.931 --> 22:01.612
It was.

22:01.632 --> 22:07.742
It had a hell of an editorial page and a hell of a sports section, and it had a handful of...

22:08.212 --> 22:13.497
Fullyard Roberts.

22:13.797 --> 22:17.861
He was not a great writer, but he was sort of a poor boy.

22:17.881 --> 22:20.023
Money's going off the reservation.

22:22.666 --> 22:26.089
But they didn't have any money.

22:26.109 --> 22:27.791
They were losing a million bucks a year.

22:28.411 --> 22:35.198
And, you know, to hire an $80 a week reporter, you had to have the publisher's permission.

22:35.650 --> 22:37.232
This is Kate Graham.

22:37.252 --> 22:39.975
You wonder if she's almost too good to be true.

22:39.995 --> 22:44.740
I mean, the support that she... She was too good to be true.

22:44.760 --> 22:49.545
I mean, she... Tom is an authority on her, too.

22:49.685 --> 22:54.229
I mean, she's quite extraordinary.

22:54.249 --> 23:00.716
The guts that she showed in taking it over from her husband when she had zero training, zero!

23:00.876 --> 23:03.379
And...

23:03.359 --> 23:14.490
Pretty clear, tough head.

23:14.510 --> 23:15.112
I'm worried about it now, Tom.

23:15.132 --> 23:15.352
Oh, me too.

23:15.373 --> 23:15.894
That hook's all bent over.

23:15.914 --> 23:16.496
She seems to get out of here.

23:16.516 --> 23:16.997
Want to take a place in?

23:17.804 --> 23:41.213
she's uh she plays tennis still she says i can play tennis but i can't stand up at a party i remember years ago when i spent the year in washington i had a fellowship down there hanging charlie seed and i yeah i covered the bobby baker trial i was kind of an intern and my job used to be to drive mary mcglory back to the star at the end of it and you mentioned how you used to carry her back

23:41.193 --> 23:42.817
We all did.

23:42.878 --> 23:43.961
We were bearers.

23:44.061 --> 23:47.109
What a thrill that was for me to have my father.

23:47.149 --> 23:49.055
I can't wait to tell Mary.

23:49.195 --> 23:50.318
Another bearer.

23:50.378 --> 23:52.404
You were a driver, though.

23:52.424 --> 23:53.306
But I was also an intern.

23:53.326 --> 23:57.177
I was sitting in the trial, and I was writing my thesis on the Bobby Baker case.

23:57.157 --> 24:08.934
She'll go out with her shoes on, won't she?

24:09.395 --> 24:14.322
She'll never remember.

24:15.003 --> 24:20.030
And wonderfully used by Newby.

24:20.691 --> 24:22.033
Just send her up there.

24:22.267 --> 24:41.001
Is he still around or did he... No.

24:41.200 --> 24:43.604
I knew they had the summer place.

24:43.624 --> 24:45.748
They lived there full-time.

24:45.768 --> 24:49.295
I don't know until the last summer.

24:49.315 --> 24:53.803
Daddy looked great, and so did Bepi.

24:54.064 --> 24:56.087
Yeah.

24:56.187 --> 24:56.688
Bepi.

24:56.708 --> 24:57.189
Bepi.

24:57.209 --> 24:57.790
Bepi.

24:57.810 --> 24:58.672
Yeah.

24:58.832 --> 25:00.876
But he did go down.

25:01.136 --> 25:05.084
He was living at Harvard for a while, then he went down to North Carolina.

25:05.184 --> 25:05.284
Yeah.

25:05.264 --> 25:11.219
Living a very simple life.

25:11.560 --> 25:12.622
I think he's got much money.

25:12.963 --> 25:13.043
Who?

25:13.063 --> 25:14.427
I think he has much money.

25:14.447 --> 25:14.788
Judy?

25:14.808 --> 25:19.459
Well, I don't, they didn't make it, but I don't know what they spent to keep that paper going.

25:21.059 --> 25:22.701
I heard a great anecdote.

25:22.741 --> 25:23.182
I don't know.

25:23.202 --> 25:27.949
I mean, you could use it, I guess, but it's so not apropos.

25:31.594 --> 25:33.317
Who was it that told me this story?

25:33.537 --> 25:45.174
Oh, John Heckinger, who was the old man who ran a big hardware and lumber company in Do-It-Yourself.

25:45.695 --> 25:50.762
And at the time when the Time magazine was...

25:51.046 --> 25:53.869
had given up on the star, really.

25:53.889 --> 25:57.333
They'd lost 85 million dollars, and they were looking for a buyer.

25:57.653 --> 26:00.056
How come a bunch of Washington, D.C.

26:00.096 --> 26:14.391
businessmen went to Shepley, Jim Shepley, and said, you can't let the star fall.

26:14.591 --> 26:16.493
You've got to sell it to us.

26:16.513 --> 26:19.416
And Shepley, this is all heck of a talking to you.

26:19.396 --> 26:26.705
I said, I can't sell it to you.

26:26.725 --> 26:29.829
I'm looking for a sucker.

26:29.849 --> 26:34.535
And Hecken just said, well, there are no suckers out there.

26:35.056 --> 26:41.304
And then he said, well, Joe Albritton found one.

26:41.324 --> 26:42.605
Meaning him, Joe.

26:45.990 --> 26:46.730
That's a huge story.

26:46.751 --> 26:47.211
But I don't know.

26:47.231 --> 26:47.952
If I can get back there.

26:48.370 --> 26:51.577
I brought up Mary McGlory in the Bobby Baker case for a reason.

26:51.597 --> 26:59.915
I wrote this thesis on the Bobby Baker story as the perfect, I remember Charlie Sieb said, the Bobby Baker story was the perfect Washington story.

27:00.035 --> 27:01.418
So remember,

27:01.718 --> 27:03.800
Congress is our city hall.

27:03.981 --> 27:07.425
And I wonder if Watergate was a lot like that for you.

27:07.485 --> 27:11.249
I mean, it's a great national, international story.

27:11.389 --> 27:12.010
But that's right.

27:12.030 --> 27:16.836
And the point is, you put two metro guys on the story.

27:16.896 --> 27:19.579
Two city side reporters, not national reporters.

27:19.599 --> 27:20.840
You originally went on the story.

27:21.181 --> 27:28.249
And you put two metro guys on a break-in, because that's what it was in the beginning.

27:28.229 --> 27:47.011
Well, Joe Calivano tipped Howie Simons to it.

27:47.031 --> 27:47.993
Simons, uh...

27:48.327 --> 27:54.981
It's wonderful how that stuff flows downhill on a Saturday morning called up Barry Sutton.

27:55.001 --> 27:55.703
Harry Roosevelt.

27:56.324 --> 27:57.246
Roosevelt called Sussman.

27:57.306 --> 27:58.369
Sussman called Woodward Burst.

27:59.732 --> 28:02.217
Is that mine or yours?

28:02.979 --> 28:04.542
Yours.

28:04.562 --> 28:06.226
How about some of this stuff?

28:06.266 --> 28:07.990
Don't touch it.

28:08.010 --> 28:08.631
Lemon.

28:09.708 --> 28:16.882
You're quite right.

28:17.002 --> 28:18.505
I'm sorry, I missed that.

28:18.565 --> 28:19.888
Why is he defensive about this?

28:19.908 --> 28:21.892
Well, somebody tried it.

28:21.912 --> 28:25.399
We were there this morning.

28:26.020 --> 28:28.384
We were there this morning.

28:28.545 --> 28:30.248
Oh, is that this morning?

28:30.616 --> 28:40.049
There's nothing frivolous about the style section.

28:40.670 --> 28:55.611
It's a very, very serious section devoted to covering the non-working light of the community.

28:55.591 --> 29:07.152
The guy, he called style the godfather of me, the godfather of infotainment.

29:07.372 --> 29:10.518
Yeah, come on.

29:10.538 --> 29:10.798
Who did this?

29:10.818 --> 29:12.301
I don't know.

29:13.242 --> 29:14.665
The guy asked me.

29:14.685 --> 29:15.106
What is this?

29:15.126 --> 29:15.446
Serious columns.

29:15.466 --> 29:15.647
Oh, sure.

29:15.667 --> 29:16.989
Serious commentary on the arts.

29:17.009 --> 29:18.011
The most important of all, it's the only word.

29:18.031 --> 29:18.312
I'm sure that.

29:18.332 --> 29:18.612
The only word.

29:18.592 --> 29:25.222
This man, what I've ever heard of, will run two or three major profiles a week.

29:26.364 --> 29:28.187
And they're really terrific profiles.

29:28.207 --> 29:28.708
Good.

29:28.828 --> 29:32.073
Well, you basically pioneered the style section.

29:32.093 --> 29:34.456
I think you maybe even invented the phrase, didn't you?

29:34.536 --> 29:35.558
I think I did.

29:35.578 --> 29:38.142
I think every damn paper in America now has a style section.

29:38.422 --> 29:39.885
Has a style editor.

29:39.965 --> 29:42.409
And they don't call it none of her anymore.

29:42.429 --> 29:43.570
They don't call it style.

29:43.911 --> 29:44.952
A lot of them do.

29:44.972 --> 29:47.316
What do you call yours?

29:47.296 --> 29:53.190
You know, I write for 25 papers, at least half of them have style sessions.

29:53.371 --> 30:01.170
I mean, it's all according to perspective or it's, you know, scene or view or...

30:01.522 --> 30:06.970
Well, is it soft news, so to speak, in your worldview?

30:06.990 --> 30:07.712
Soft news?

30:08.132 --> 30:21.673
Yeah, there's some soft news, but I mean, if you name a new director in the National Gallery, we've got a real hard news profile on it, and there's a lot of...

30:23.189 --> 30:30.261
Take style stories and put them on face.

30:30.281 --> 30:42.562
Paul Mellon's last gift to the National Gallery the other day.

30:42.582 --> 30:42.962
That's a big story.

30:42.982 --> 30:43.924
That's going right on view, too, they said.

30:43.944 --> 30:44.505
It's just amazing, isn't it?

30:44.485 --> 30:56.868
These oysters are really outstanding.

30:56.888 --> 30:57.229
They're terrific.

30:58.542 --> 31:01.506
Tell me about the actual writing of this book.

31:01.526 --> 31:02.848
How long did it take?

31:02.968 --> 31:06.573
I think it could actually be used as a textbook.

31:06.633 --> 31:14.383
It took a long time because I never was a writer like some of these kids can write.

31:14.704 --> 31:24.837
I became a kind of a disciplined writer, but it was years before I could get up from the console of the studio organ with a

31:25.711 --> 31:28.496
I had a feeling that I'd really written a pretty good story.

31:29.918 --> 31:35.548
And then when I got out, I made me an editor, so I didn't write, I rewrote somewhere.

31:35.568 --> 31:39.315
A lot of stuff, did a lot of first one, two graphs or something like that.

31:40.857 --> 31:45.024
Simon used to say I was a sprinter.

31:45.044 --> 31:47.248
150 words after that, he tended to get lost.

31:49.692 --> 31:51.195
So it was...

31:51.817 --> 31:55.327
It's hard to write about yourself and it's hard to write at you.

31:55.387 --> 31:56.750
Be really truthful.

31:57.733 --> 31:59.097
How long did it take your life?

32:00.180 --> 32:00.782
Three years?

32:00.842 --> 32:02.205
Two and a half years?

32:02.266 --> 32:04.772
Did you write it on a word processor?

32:04.792 --> 32:06.838
That's quite a change, isn't it?

32:06.818 --> 32:09.604
Tell them how you started doing.

32:10.165 --> 32:11.828
By getting somebody to know for you.

32:11.928 --> 32:12.750
Yeah.

32:12.950 --> 32:17.078
We went back with a buddy of mine, Tom Wilkinson.

32:17.399 --> 32:22.870
We went back to the early papers from August 65 when I went to work.

32:23.795 --> 32:26.380
We looked at five or six years worth of papers.

32:26.521 --> 32:31.351
And you know what the biggest change in the post is?

32:31.692 --> 32:33.796
I hate to say this, but with design.

32:34.898 --> 32:39.508
It is so much easier to read now before you get into substance.

32:39.775 --> 32:48.792
It's narrow, eight column pages with one column on, and no white space in the makeup at all.

32:48.812 --> 32:50.636
Do you have as many stories as you can?

32:50.656 --> 32:54.543
I think the Globe's design is very good.

32:54.563 --> 32:55.625
Do you think so?

32:55.825 --> 32:56.126
Yeah, I do.

32:56.146 --> 33:02.037
I mean, you know they're going to have to go and do it all over again when they change the web width.

33:03.113 --> 33:13.949
I saw a memo the other day about what is entailed, what that entails, and it's just unbelievable.

33:13.969 --> 33:14.530
What entails?

33:14.550 --> 33:15.231
You mean changing?

33:15.551 --> 33:16.152
Well, they change.

33:16.172 --> 33:19.817
They take a quarter of an inch off of this place and a quarter of an inch off of that.

33:19.837 --> 33:22.401
So the columns are no longer filled with spikers or something like that?

33:22.541 --> 33:25.806
They can't be or else you won't be able to read it if you hold it.

33:25.826 --> 33:28.530
So it's a narrower column?

33:28.510 --> 33:34.276
You either got to narrow the column or go to five and widen it.

33:34.456 --> 33:36.658
And what are you going to do?

33:36.678 --> 33:41.523
You lose a whole lot of your news hall.

33:41.543 --> 33:47.869
And, you know, to handle it, you're going to have to increase the art.

33:47.889 --> 33:49.891
That further reduces the news hall.

33:49.911 --> 33:51.652
They have so much planning to do on that.

33:51.672 --> 33:52.793
You won't believe it.

33:52.813 --> 33:56.577
You know, you walk into any newsroom today, any planet,

33:57.029 --> 34:09.141
Because those of us who work with the line of sight machines with that clacking sound and that wonderful stuff and that, you know, silence in these things, they have music going.

34:09.161 --> 34:09.702
Oh, not music.

34:09.722 --> 34:10.583
Well, whatever.

34:10.703 --> 34:12.685
But you wonder where it's going.

34:12.945 --> 34:18.631
I mean, with the cost of newsprint now, it's close to $1,000.

34:18.771 --> 34:21.193
I mean, they're projecting, aren't they projecting $1,000?

34:21.213 --> 34:21.934
Oh, are they?

34:21.954 --> 34:22.935
Something like, what is it, $600?

34:23.320 --> 34:44.064
Is it 600?

34:44.084 --> 34:44.605
Has it come down at least?

34:44.625 --> 34:46.347
I have a nice time getting it to new newspapers because of this damn newsprint crisis.

34:46.367 --> 34:48.069
Everybody's cut down in their news holes and they're not taking on in their features.

34:48.089 --> 34:48.649
I just wonder where it goes.

34:48.670 --> 34:49.991
Do you think that there's a newspaper that's on your watch, right?

34:50.011 --> 34:51.172
I thought I'd get out long before I had to play something.

34:51.192 --> 34:51.453
I don't know.

34:51.473 --> 34:52.534
You know, there's going to be 500 channels on your...

34:53.392 --> 35:19.888
just on your television set and there's going to be so much uh better than that over and that hotter than that this way pretty soon a great reason for newspapers is that we put some order in your life and uh you know and we already do that a little bit and we already give news readers that second and third paragraphs that the uh television can't give you

35:20.881 --> 35:32.133
Cyberspace is great news for the good papers and possibly the death and health.

35:33.014 --> 35:35.757
That's right.

35:38.680 --> 35:39.962
I think that's true.

35:39.982 --> 35:40.562
Yeah, that's interesting.

35:40.582 --> 35:42.925
I don't think... That's a lot of great news from the Syrian papers.

35:42.945 --> 35:44.707
But wait, we're all... The globe, I'm sure, is dabbling at it.

35:44.727 --> 35:45.507
I mean, you've got an electronic paper.

35:45.527 --> 35:46.028
I'm sure we do.

35:46.008 --> 35:59.672
I went in the other day.

35:59.692 --> 36:02.697
I said, I'm sick of hearing about this.

36:02.717 --> 36:03.538
I want to go in.

36:03.558 --> 36:06.864
Well, the first thing you go in is that these kids are all 12 years old that are running it and programming it.

36:06.884 --> 36:08.146
And they are absolutely different breeds than what I'm do, sir.

36:08.166 --> 36:09.048
And they know more about it than we do, too.

36:09.068 --> 36:09.248
Oh, yeah.

36:09.268 --> 36:09.729
He's done this for him.

36:09.749 --> 36:10.210
He's done this for him.

36:11.708 --> 36:19.798
Did you ever see that movie, The Paper?

36:19.818 --> 36:22.961
Yeah, sure.

36:23.061 --> 36:24.123
I love that.

36:24.143 --> 36:26.285
Yeah, I love that.

36:26.305 --> 36:36.017
I think of all the newspaper movies I've seen, it really does seem to be Michael Keaton.

36:36.037 --> 36:36.377
Michael Keaton.

36:36.457 --> 36:37.919
Did you see that, Mr. Winchester?

36:37.939 --> 36:38.179
Yeah, I did.

36:38.199 --> 36:39.261
It's very good, isn't it?

36:39.281 --> 36:41.243
You know, the comedy movie may come up.

36:41.223 --> 36:51.281
Which one?

36:51.301 --> 36:51.361
No.

36:51.381 --> 36:51.783
Is Redford doing it?

36:51.803 --> 36:52.506
No, I think he's... Redford passed?

36:52.526 --> 36:52.887
I think he passed.

36:53.373 --> 37:08.562
I was just very excited about it.

37:08.582 --> 37:09.203
I was kind of nervous about it.

37:09.223 --> 37:10.405
Well, they spent well over a couple of million bucks on it.

37:10.425 --> 37:11.487
Busing around and getting rips written and rewritten.

37:11.507 --> 37:12.008
Which movie is this, sir?

37:12.028 --> 37:12.850
Which movie is this you're talking about?

37:12.830 --> 37:36.040
He had a tough go as the editor of the Atlanta Constitution.

37:36.060 --> 37:36.901
I know that.

37:36.921 --> 37:37.923
I think Pat Connery is writing a novel about that.

37:37.943 --> 37:39.064
Bill Connery's a great friend of garbage and stuff.

37:39.084 --> 37:39.705
He's the architect of the deal.

37:39.725 --> 37:40.005
Is that right?

37:40.025 --> 37:40.626
That didn't last long.

37:40.606 --> 38:07.677
Well, I

38:07.842 --> 38:22.385
What I like is that you give a lot of these little observations about the business.

38:22.645 --> 38:25.770
I didn't want to put that all in one chapter.

38:25.790 --> 38:27.292
It sounds so pompous.

38:27.312 --> 38:28.714
It's nice though.

38:28.855 --> 38:31.639
I know that I love books about the newspaper business.

38:31.619 --> 38:43.994
to see a pro talk about it, not just his experiences, and to your credit, you also, you know, Janet Cook was their listener.

38:44.014 --> 38:46.657
I mean, you talk about polar opposite stories.

38:46.677 --> 38:53.526
It was almost a worthwhile experience though, wasn't it?

38:53.586 --> 38:54.026
The Cook thing.

38:54.106 --> 38:57.751
I mean, you hate to see what happened, you hate to return a Pulitzer Prize, as you did.

38:57.771 --> 38:59.533
But nevertheless, I think it really had its

39:00.037 --> 39:04.683
Maybe we had gone too far in the business and thought a lesson.

39:05.123 --> 39:07.647
There's a lesson there.

39:07.667 --> 39:08.127
Terrible.

39:08.147 --> 39:10.590
And, you know, nobody died back then.

39:10.610 --> 39:11.552
Nobody committed suicide.

39:11.772 --> 39:13.354
It'll pass over, Benny.

39:13.374 --> 39:17.619
It'll blow right over, Benny.

39:18.901 --> 39:19.762
Come on.

39:19.782 --> 39:20.723
That's what he said to me.

39:20.743 --> 39:22.345
That's funny.

39:22.646 --> 39:25.129
Two o'clock in the morning.

39:25.149 --> 39:25.369
Welcome up.

39:25.906 --> 39:40.168
Well, in the two, in Sapphires, he said you'd set your finger in his eye twice or something.

39:40.629 --> 39:42.311
I was against him getting it.

39:42.632 --> 39:45.797
The first time he was proposed for a Pulitzer.

39:45.817 --> 39:46.658
You and I both.

39:46.678 --> 39:47.499
You and I did.

39:47.599 --> 39:48.922
We were two votes against him.

39:48.942 --> 39:51.285
Everyone else voted for him.

39:51.305 --> 39:53.128
We didn't sway anybody.

39:53.108 --> 40:07.268
We were fussing around with who to give it to.

40:07.609 --> 40:10.493
We didn't like any of the finalists that came up to us.

40:10.473 --> 40:29.686
John Hughes reached down, a former Christian science monitor, reached down into a briefcase, and he pulled out two or three columns by soundbite and said, this guy was ahead of the news consistently, way ahead of the reporters.

40:29.706 --> 40:30.347
On the breadland story.

40:30.367 --> 40:32.110
On the breadland story.

40:32.410 --> 40:37.239
He made a ring, ring... Was it as a columnist that he won?

40:37.499 --> 40:39.543
Yeah, yeah.

40:39.683 --> 40:41.646
Did you think that was a new story?

40:43.029 --> 40:48.158
Well, he was just... No, I think you and I are going to get into it because...

40:48.138 --> 40:53.023
Because he's just come off of being a black person for Nixon and so forth.

40:54.004 --> 40:56.447
I think there's a little Watergate burning inside of us.

40:56.467 --> 40:56.867
Maybe.

40:57.788 --> 40:58.469
I don't know.

40:58.489 --> 40:58.869
But anyway.

40:58.889 --> 41:01.972
I interviewed him a couple of weeks ago.

41:02.833 --> 41:04.355
He writes the best column in one.

41:04.715 --> 41:06.117
He's the best column.

41:06.137 --> 41:06.778
He does.

41:06.838 --> 41:08.279
He writes a beautiful column.

41:08.299 --> 41:09.961
He really can piss away.

41:10.081 --> 41:11.242
Colin doesn't.

41:11.883 --> 41:12.143
He does.

41:12.343 --> 41:14.446
What a memory he's got.

41:14.506 --> 41:15.867
Then I got...

41:16.218 --> 41:22.060
He, um, had to do with Angleton.

41:22.281 --> 41:24.008
Angleton.

41:24.028 --> 41:25.333
Angleton was his friend.

41:25.769 --> 41:29.594
And he dedicates this book to Angleton.

41:30.455 --> 41:31.296
Oh, does he?

41:31.316 --> 41:31.917
He does.

41:31.937 --> 41:33.580
He absolutely dedicates it.

41:33.600 --> 41:35.923
Jesus Angleton, he says.

41:35.983 --> 41:36.884
An homage to Angleton.

41:37.004 --> 41:38.426
An homage to Angleton.

41:38.446 --> 41:40.889
Here's what, I mean, it defies belief.

41:40.909 --> 41:42.271
He's so sophisticated.

41:43.072 --> 41:48.840
He says that Angleton was looking for Mary's diary.

41:49.799 --> 41:54.652
out of a commitment to protect the reputation of the President of the United States.

41:54.672 --> 41:55.393
That's right.

41:55.413 --> 41:56.556
My ass.

41:57.419 --> 41:59.725
I mean, that just is not true.

41:59.805 --> 42:00.687
In first place,

42:01.392 --> 42:07.558
The CIA, after Bissell, did not like Kennedy.

42:07.818 --> 42:13.043
After Cuba, they did not only didn't like it, they did not.

42:13.063 --> 42:25.194
In second place, you know, he says that, what, Angleton kept that diary for two years, and he says he hopes he made a copy of it?

42:25.214 --> 42:27.136
Why do you need that copy?

42:27.156 --> 42:28.437
Am I crazy about that?

42:28.717 --> 42:29.678
No, you're not.

42:29.911 --> 42:32.258
Jeez.

42:32.278 --> 42:40.683
But I finally terminally pissed off Cicely Angleton.

42:40.703 --> 42:41.225
She's mad.

42:41.245 --> 42:42.047
She says it.

42:42.803 --> 42:51.818
that Jim was somehow nobly motivated.

42:51.838 --> 42:55.003
Why the hell didn't he do that?

42:56.125 --> 42:57.988
Why didn't he?

42:58.088 --> 42:58.990
I don't know.

42:59.671 --> 43:05.681
I've noticed in a few of the interviews you've done the 60-minute speech last week, which I thought was pretty good.

43:05.701 --> 43:09.267
But inevitably, of course, you find other reporters who say,

43:09.550 --> 43:11.453
You must have known about Kennedy's car.

43:11.473 --> 43:12.894
Well, everybody says that.

43:13.235 --> 43:14.977
Is that starting to get?

43:14.997 --> 43:16.119
It gets out of my skin a little.

43:17.761 --> 43:31.019
Because it seems so obvious to me that I would not talk to this man about fucking his wife were present and my wife were present.

43:31.179 --> 43:34.624
And that was when I saw him.

43:35.605 --> 43:38.629
I may have been able to get to him on the phone for a minute, but you didn't.

43:38.980 --> 44:04.988
waste the minute you got but there was no scuttlebutt in the newsroom about it at all there really wasn't much scuttlebutt there was there was what uh what uh my dad once said he's a fearful girl but that was reputations about him yeah and going back to when he was not even married you know he and george smathers were the swordsmen of the senate that's funny because what i was doing like

44:05.558 --> 44:15.353
the Bobby Baker thing, I was looking through all the files of the Star, Paul Holt and John Barron's files, they covered the Baker Trump.

44:15.373 --> 44:23.164
I remember seeing one memo that said, Snatters and Kennedy are the biggest poor masters in the U.S., or were in the U.S.

44:23.184 --> 44:27.050
Senate, but again, that's prior to Mary and Jackie.

44:27.872 --> 44:30.876
But he did have a reputation with Snatters.

44:31.016 --> 44:33.540
I mean,

44:34.229 --> 44:34.753
Which one?

44:35.156 --> 44:35.802
Whoremaster.

44:36.507 --> 44:39.531
She's got to do a lot of talking before you call the whoremaster.

44:39.899 --> 44:52.519
I didn't know about it, and I can't help it if they don't believe it.

44:52.599 --> 44:54.642
What do you think?

44:54.783 --> 45:00.572
If the powers that be knew about it, would he have been protected?

45:00.592 --> 45:03.597
I mean, we all know that there's this great symbiosis that goes around it.

45:04.398 --> 45:07.543
He might have made it to Mary Meyer, but he wouldn't have made it to

45:07.523 --> 45:30.713
Nobody wants to talk about whether

45:31.655 --> 45:40.964
what having an affair does in terms of does it make him a better president or a worse president?

45:41.124 --> 45:42.005
Like he cares, right?

45:42.165 --> 45:46.949
And you know, I've talked so much about this, including to a lot of women.

45:46.969 --> 45:48.390
I don't think the women.

45:49.191 --> 45:52.114
I think it's the guys that are sore about it than the women.

45:52.414 --> 45:57.839
Maybe the multiplicity of it is really outrageous.

45:57.859 --> 46:00.902
What do you think in general about the standard that's being...

46:01.304 --> 46:12.859
placed on public people, not just politicians, but I mean, you know, remember how they followed Hart, what's his name around, what a stupid move that was, right?

46:13.240 --> 46:25.035
They almost challenged them to do it, and they did it, and they caught him, I mean, that was amazing.

46:25.135 --> 46:27.158
Was Hart done in hindsight?

46:27.178 --> 46:29.421
Did we go too far?

46:31.105 --> 46:33.588
He lied about it.

46:33.608 --> 46:34.669
He didn't.

46:35.410 --> 46:35.870
Larry Hart.

46:36.531 --> 46:44.520
The other guy didn't lie about it because they never asked.

46:44.800 --> 46:46.281
Would Hart have been a bad president?

46:46.341 --> 46:49.605
I think Hart would have probably been a pretty good president.

46:49.625 --> 46:52.748
You know, he was a pre-Clinton Clinton.

46:53.449 --> 46:59.796
But did that compulsion and that compulsion to lie in December

47:00.248 --> 47:06.475
Is that a disqualifying characteristic or evidence of a disqualifying?

47:06.495 --> 47:13.704
I tend to think it was, but I hate to be in the position of being the judge of that.

47:14.024 --> 47:22.054
You know, the president should be judged by the electorate, not by some goddamn editor.

47:22.094 --> 47:30.103
You mentioned, I don't know if you use that word in the book, but the symbiosis that exists between reporters and...

47:30.083 --> 47:33.669
And sources on the hill are in government.

47:33.689 --> 47:35.732
And obviously that must still exist.

47:36.433 --> 47:38.737
Do you think it's a productive thing?

47:39.118 --> 47:41.722
Let's say you have a source who's giving you pretty good stuff.

47:41.742 --> 47:48.072
You might overlook the fact that, you know, I'm not just about sexual, that's the case.

47:48.092 --> 47:50.677
You know, I guess Bobby Baker's a great example.

47:51.358 --> 47:54.623
Everybody, every reporter up there in the gallery knew he was building...

47:55.008 --> 48:24.711
motels he was doing this the most money he ever made was the carousel of notion city maryland i guess is where it was yeah every the press all went out there and buses as his guest nobody ever wrote about it but because he was a pretty good source you'll get caught at it you knew it today and that's a that's a plus i mean if you go bail constantly for some truck or for somebody who's involved in the very sections you're gonna get caught

48:25.248 --> 48:45.662
I'm quite amazed, though, by how literally people seem to accept the press as a cop, the press as a prosecutor, the press as an investigator.

48:45.682 --> 48:49.028
I'm a great believer in the self-policing movement.

48:49.987 --> 48:53.672
The ability of the press comes out every day.

48:53.692 --> 49:00.562
I think we're pretty good at kind of correcting a lot of our errors.

49:00.582 --> 49:01.444
More and more.

49:01.464 --> 49:07.993
I bet you we're going to be a little more rational on snooping under the bed.

49:08.013 --> 49:12.520
Remind me of the other professions that have that public policing of themselves.

49:13.121 --> 49:19.470
Shirley's held Dr. Stone and until Steve Brill came along, Lawyer's Stone.

49:19.805 --> 49:26.539
And, uh... Well, there's a story the other day about a doctor, a brain surgeon, opens up the wrong side of the skull, right?

49:26.559 --> 49:27.705
Do some wrong surgery?

49:27.905 --> 49:32.891
There have been two in Boston, wasn't there?

49:33.231 --> 49:41.461
One is the Globe Reporter, and then there was something at Children's Hospital.

49:41.481 --> 49:48.269
Somebody's already told me about that, knowing my interest in Children's Hospital.

49:49.491 --> 49:55.237
The Globe Reporter's family.

49:55.317 --> 49:57.540
I think many several.

49:57.807 --> 49:59.069
And they settled right away.

50:00.752 --> 50:03.676
And what happened to the doctor?

50:03.696 --> 50:05.699
He got inspired.

50:05.719 --> 50:07.342
Yeah, but I don't think it was the doctor's fault.

50:07.442 --> 50:10.547
No, they landed on one of them.

50:10.567 --> 50:11.789
It closed downhill, yeah.

50:12.450 --> 50:13.872
You say that in the book, too.

50:13.952 --> 50:17.037
Even in the newspaper business, it closed downhill.

50:17.057 --> 50:22.566
Did you... You probably hired that one.

50:23.592 --> 50:24.674
I knew her.

50:24.694 --> 50:27.297
I worked with her in Worcester.

50:27.437 --> 50:28.399
I knew her very well.

50:29.440 --> 50:32.585
She's a good woman.

50:32.965 --> 50:36.230
She's a nice, nice woman.

50:36.851 --> 50:37.972
She could be a bitch, too.

50:38.172 --> 50:41.697
That sometimes grows, but that's part of her.

50:42.659 --> 50:43.420
It makes me good people.

50:43.440 --> 50:44.301
She was a hell of a black guy.

50:44.939 --> 51:00.082
With a PhD, that's what Ben called.

51:01.404 --> 51:02.706
We talked about the bullets.

51:02.966 --> 51:08.134
You discuss in the book how political it is.

51:08.194 --> 51:12.280
How really one shouldn't necessarily construe receiving the award with the best

51:12.563 --> 51:14.620
Is that a fear?

51:15.265 --> 51:17.342
I'm not convinced that the best stories

51:17.812 --> 51:19.895
Won a Pulitzer every year.

51:19.915 --> 51:22.318
Wins, I guess.

51:22.339 --> 51:22.599
Wins, yeah.

51:22.719 --> 51:23.440
I've been home.

51:23.540 --> 51:25.403
Everybody tells me I was very hot on them.

51:25.423 --> 51:27.626
I bit my hand that got me for so long.

51:27.766 --> 51:29.289
I probably did.

51:29.489 --> 51:30.630
Did you get it on top?

51:30.650 --> 51:34.075
No, I haven't gotten it from anybody yet.

51:34.156 --> 51:38.662
Well, I mean, I've gotten it from... Kay gave it to me a little bit.

51:38.882 --> 51:41.146
I think, jeez, do they really want to do that?

51:41.306 --> 51:43.549
But do you ever... Do you feel...

51:43.529 --> 51:48.079
following that the next step, but there are any stories that you guys did that were deserving of it.

51:48.099 --> 51:51.486
Oh, I sure as hell did.

51:51.506 --> 51:58.883
The year that we won the Watergate Prize, the jurors had not given us that prize.

51:58.903 --> 52:03.192
They had not recommended that we get it, but they had recommended us to three others.

52:03.172 --> 52:03.993
No kidding.

52:04.153 --> 52:08.818
Three others, which is, you know, all the time ties the record.

52:08.838 --> 52:22.633
And then they told, they agreed amongst themselves with me out of the room, although, before I got there, I guess, that we should win it for the Public Service Award for Watergate.

52:22.653 --> 52:23.935
And that gave us four.

52:24.175 --> 52:25.316
I was out of control.

52:25.356 --> 52:28.740
I mean, I was just trying to be so... And then they took two away.

52:29.378 --> 52:39.519
took one away from Haynes and they took one away from Bob Kaiser and Dan Morgan on foreign reporting.

52:39.739 --> 52:41.904
And were they deserving of the interview?

52:42.004 --> 52:43.166
Who knows?

52:43.267 --> 52:46.453
I can't say that.

52:46.754 --> 52:48.838
The best story always gets there.

52:48.818 --> 52:50.782
He doesn't ever get it.

52:50.983 --> 52:51.965
It's so arbitrary.

52:52.085 --> 52:56.133
It's not like who has the most points at the end of that fourth quarter.

52:56.154 --> 53:00.843
Who's captured the sympathy and admiration of the aggressor?

53:00.863 --> 53:02.307
Who's got a hard-on for somebody?

53:02.767 --> 53:05.393
There's also a lot of legitimacy.

53:06.436 --> 53:19.448
It's funny that there's so much lobbying, it's almost like winning a high school trophy.

53:19.468 --> 53:21.690
She's got the better PR firm.

53:21.750 --> 53:23.572
Who's going to put together?

53:23.592 --> 53:31.139
Well, you're not just supposed to lobby, but of course, you get caught lobbying in your day.

53:31.159 --> 53:31.860
Yep, they do lobby.

53:31.880 --> 53:34.182
Send out reprints.

53:34.202 --> 53:34.502
I've seen them.

53:34.870 --> 53:37.534
I never did that, did you?

53:37.634 --> 53:42.241
In fact, the way we packaged our things was embarrassing.

53:42.321 --> 53:43.203
It wasn't very good.

53:43.223 --> 53:46.348
It had taste all over it.

53:46.388 --> 53:58.566
You know, you had somebody's secretary or some girl up in the county or something did it.

53:59.047 --> 54:02.312
I maintain we still hold a good record.

54:02.292 --> 54:04.998
We got three in 1980.

54:05.398 --> 54:07.222
We got three.

54:08.044 --> 54:09.066
Well, it's in plus two seconds.

54:09.086 --> 54:09.627
Yeah.

54:09.647 --> 54:11.391
We got three at eight.

54:11.411 --> 54:11.511
Yeah.

54:11.531 --> 54:17.043
There's been two or three other times that I think require us on three.

54:17.063 --> 54:22.073
I was on three a couple of years ago after I left.

54:22.778 --> 54:35.117
yeah but you were in uh you went into exile after that you were blank for a while and i got blanked after well i got blanked after janet cook

54:35.992 --> 54:57.222
He was the only guy from Washington, and he'd give him read those stories and say, yeah, no idea.

54:57.322 --> 55:03.130
That story he had on the police department, man.

55:03.565 --> 55:29.556
the mayor of washington announced the following day that they had a guy who knew who he was and then there was a dr gullity from howard said she was she was treating the mother whatever doubts we had disappeared if we had any i didn't know they were on the trail right there

55:29.536 --> 55:32.765
Let me see if there's anything else here.

55:33.167 --> 55:35.012
Growing up just fine.

55:35.072 --> 55:37.900
He's got dignity.

55:39.104 --> 55:42.012
He's quite an elephant there.

55:42.112 --> 55:44.760
He's more grown up than he was.

55:44.740 --> 55:49.145
I see a lot of them at the African Americans.

55:49.846 --> 55:50.827
I think he's just great.

55:50.847 --> 55:52.789
Have you met, you know his wife, Pat King?

55:52.809 --> 55:54.311
No, you've been talking about it.

55:54.331 --> 55:55.292
Is he nice?

55:55.312 --> 55:56.594
Oh, God, she's probably nice.

55:57.355 --> 55:59.457
She's got a wonderful woman.

55:59.477 --> 56:01.039
She's white and black.

56:01.059 --> 56:03.382
And she teaches at Georgetown Law.

56:04.283 --> 56:06.405
And she's just great.

56:06.465 --> 56:10.410
Yeah, he's a nice guy.

56:11.015 --> 56:12.439
Some coffee, gentlemen?

56:12.520 --> 56:12.700
What?

56:12.841 --> 56:13.342
A cup of coffee?

56:13.924 --> 56:14.365
Uh, yeah.

56:14.546 --> 56:15.689
I don't have to be anywhere.

56:15.770 --> 56:16.873
I'm so clear.

56:16.893 --> 56:19.682
I've got to roll my liver over.

56:20.263 --> 56:20.805
I've just been eating it.
