WEBVTT

00:02.613 --> 00:17.490
I went to see the man who was responsible for their philanthropy.

00:17.550 --> 00:22.736
I guess his name was Leonard Gens, and he had an office in New York, and he was a very nice man.

00:23.537 --> 00:29.464
And he asked me a lot of hard questions, and I would say two or three times,

00:29.680 --> 00:32.704
I can't answer that, but I'll find out the answer for you.

00:33.144 --> 00:36.388
So when I got back, I said to David Murphy, I got to know everything.

00:36.428 --> 00:49.763
I got to know how many students are there, how many men, and how many women, and how many are on scholarship, and how much financial aid we give, and I have to know all kinds of things like that.

00:50.404 --> 00:53.287
So again, I went through a course of sprouts.

00:54.229 --> 00:58.894
I set myself out to try not to...

00:59.195 --> 01:02.419
ever be asked a question I couldn't answer.

01:02.439 --> 01:08.266
And that stood me in good stead, and I knew quite a lot, learned quite a lot from that.

01:09.107 --> 01:14.473
And where did we start with?

01:14.733 --> 01:27.008
I guess we were talking aboutâ€” I think I asked vaguely about the fourth phase, and you said, no, there are three, I think, is what you said.

01:27.528 --> 01:46.029
Well, if there is a fourth phase, it is going to be to try to put down on paper some of the things that I feel... I would like to see Clark put in a course of some sort.

01:47.331 --> 01:53.878
First, I would like to see a group of people get together and discuss on the basis of what leadership is and can it be thought.

01:54.839 --> 01:57.062
And then I would like to see what I've

01:57.329 --> 02:21.277
said in the book in the beginning, something worked out, and other places do it, and Clark wouldn't be the first, to try to address the emotional, personal sides of people, of students.

02:21.377 --> 02:26.863
And I can illustrate this, and I'm always looking for illustrations so that I can put this across, because

02:27.130 --> 02:31.335
A handful of people know what I'm talking about, but not enough.

02:31.355 --> 02:41.769
And I heard this just the other day, to do with fundraising, because I'm in close touch with this fundraiser all the time.

02:41.789 --> 02:54.505
We have a new person who I have not yet met, who talked with, and this is secondhand, and I'm also not willing to be quoted, he talked with a

02:56.240 --> 03:00.985
a student of Clark whose father has a great deal of money and he's an only child.

03:02.868 --> 03:12.098
And we would like to be able to eventually solicit the father for help with Clark.

03:12.118 --> 03:23.952
The son has a good experience and it's amazing what, it's amazing the number of Clark students that feel that what they got at Clark has made their lives only.

03:24.758 --> 03:27.342
It is an extraordinary place.

03:27.362 --> 03:30.967
It's extraordinary because of the loyalty of everybody.

03:30.987 --> 03:35.974
It goes right down from the president to the people that clean the dormitories.

03:36.254 --> 03:39.078
It goes right through the organization in spite of everything.

03:40.039 --> 03:42.342
We had a digression again.

03:42.643 --> 03:53.618
We had a trustee who was James Byatt Coleman, professor of the kind of behavioral...

03:53.902 --> 04:00.731
I've forgotten what this title is, of whom I'm liked and abiding very much.

04:02.393 --> 04:08.040
He was on one of the committees that was searching for one of the presidents, and he made a statement to me.

04:08.060 --> 04:14.227
He said, the fierce loyalty of the faculty to Clark University is astounding.

04:14.308 --> 04:16.130
He said, it doesn't exist at Harvard.

04:16.851 --> 04:21.917
And he said, that's true of students, too.

04:22.252 --> 04:23.393
It's remarkable.

04:23.413 --> 04:24.995
I think it's true of you.

04:25.055 --> 04:26.497
I think it's true of you as well.

04:27.138 --> 04:28.259
Well, I think it is.

04:28.419 --> 04:30.642
It's an extremely good school.

04:31.463 --> 04:35.228
A lot better at Bernhardt in some ways.

04:36.750 --> 04:38.712
Well, it's small, which is nice.

04:38.732 --> 04:39.593
Yes, it is.

04:40.494 --> 04:47.403
And now where did this start from?

04:47.443 --> 04:47.803
Oh, yes.

04:48.222 --> 04:59.940
So at any rate, this new staff member went to the son and asked him to talk about various things.

05:01.322 --> 05:04.207
Did he find it difficult because he was an only child?

05:04.267 --> 05:07.132
And did he find it difficult because his father had so much money?

05:07.532 --> 05:09.075
What did he think about Clark?

05:09.635 --> 05:15.124
Working up to the fact that sometime we would like to have his advice, which he'd be

05:15.425 --> 05:18.610
how would he feel about soliciting his father?

05:19.331 --> 05:25.461
And that makes him look at himself and see what his hang-ups are.

05:25.521 --> 05:27.284
You've all got them.

05:27.304 --> 05:34.515
And that, I think, is a very important thing.

05:34.535 --> 05:37.159
And we could save people a lot of grief.

05:37.780 --> 05:42.087
People could come out of college eventually at the place where I am now.

05:42.107 --> 05:42.748
It's taken me

05:43.032 --> 05:55.927
some 80 years to get who I am now and my feelings about people and what's important and what's not and what is integrity and how I feel about people.

05:55.947 --> 05:57.469
That's a wonderful quote, by the way.

05:58.450 --> 06:00.732
I love that particular quotation right here.

06:00.752 --> 06:01.433
That's very nice.

06:01.734 --> 06:02.895
What was that?

06:02.915 --> 06:06.399
It's taken me 80 years to get how you feel about people.

06:06.679 --> 06:10.744
I see statements in terms of quotations, by the way, and I've helped

06:11.078 --> 06:14.662
and how we'll use them.

06:14.742 --> 06:16.283
Life has been an education.

06:16.724 --> 06:22.610
Education isn't bounded by four years.

06:23.391 --> 06:26.494
We should reflect on the word commencement.

06:26.774 --> 06:29.798
When somebody gets a degree, they begin.

06:29.818 --> 06:32.901
A commencement doesn't mean an ending, it means a beginning.

06:33.601 --> 06:35.984
That's a very interesting use of that word, if you think about it.

06:37.005 --> 06:39.908
Commencement exercises means beginning.

06:39.928 --> 06:40.849
Now we start.

06:41.352 --> 06:41.692
Yes.

06:41.733 --> 06:45.738
And I guess education for you has been a lifelong activity.

06:46.519 --> 06:47.881
It ought to be for everybody.

06:48.541 --> 06:55.390
And this is what, this Clark articulates this very well, is that they want to create lifelong learning.

06:56.512 --> 07:10.971
And that means to examine some of your prejudices and some of the things that you... For instance, I have no trouble with people who are not married

07:11.255 --> 07:19.383
living together, if it was done for a purpose.

07:20.404 --> 07:31.035
I'm facing this with my grandchildren all the time, because this was unheard of in my day, with anybody who had lived with anybody before he got married.

07:31.055 --> 07:32.436
I'm strictly, Alison.

07:32.456 --> 07:34.939
It was unheard of in my day.

07:35.139 --> 07:35.579
Exactly.

07:36.120 --> 07:38.342
Well, this is something that

07:38.677 --> 07:53.238
Intellectually, I condone in special circumstances, not in an escape and jumping from one person to another and that kind of thing, but with a serious, do I want to make this commitment?

07:53.699 --> 07:58.005
How can I relate to this man that I'm thinking of marrying and so forth and so on?

08:03.754 --> 08:07.519
Intellectually, it doesn't bother me.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.797
Emotionally, I couldn't do it myself.

08:10.077 --> 08:12.920
I couldn't think of doing it.

08:12.940 --> 08:16.944
I have to say that I'm kind of a conservative on this.

08:16.964 --> 08:24.191
I look at what's happening in society, these children in the ghettos who have never known a father.

08:25.191 --> 08:28.214
And so where do they turn to for role models, to games?

08:29.375 --> 08:37.303
And I'm just afraid that so much of the breakdown in society today is due to this relaxation of

08:37.402 --> 08:39.965
Oh, well, of course it is.

08:40.045 --> 08:52.441
Of course it is, because our grandchildren, I'd really like to show you a letter, I won't do it now, that our oldest grandson wrote after he had been here for his grandfather.

08:52.481 --> 08:59.810
It's a toast that he made for his grandfather for his birthday, and a toast that he made for me at my birthday.

09:00.751 --> 09:06.278
And it's not a dry eye in the house after reading it, as Bob Hoyt used to say.

09:06.298 --> 09:06.919
But...

09:08.452 --> 09:12.317
there's a basis to that.

09:12.337 --> 09:33.185
I think, for instance, I wonder if there's the African tribe, how they, because that system used to work well before we interfered with it, the tribal systems in Africa, how that relates to the family and whether it supersedes the family or whether it reinforces the family or whatnot.

09:33.205 --> 09:36.990
I'm all for the family and for stability and that kind of thing.

09:37.477 --> 09:42.743
And I certainly, I don't think any teenager has any business having a baby.

09:43.423 --> 09:53.034
And I don't think just experimenting with sex, as you would with Chinese cooking, is right at all.

09:53.194 --> 09:56.838
I'm conservative from that point of view.

09:57.639 --> 10:00.242
But there are extenuating circumstances.

10:00.622 --> 10:06.268
I think what I'm trying to say is... I think what you were saying, let me interrupt, is that in terms of exploring...

10:06.569 --> 10:10.453
the viability of relationships, I guess, is what you're saying.

10:11.754 --> 10:13.476
Yes, yes.

10:13.496 --> 10:30.232
And if you can't do it, well, here's one young person that I happen to know about, two friends of my grandfather's, who, after quite a long time, I think is living with a boy that she's been interested in.

10:30.292 --> 10:33.876
I think they're very fond of each other, but I don't think that

10:34.143 --> 10:36.365
They feel either one of them.

10:36.405 --> 10:42.610
Neither one of them has a job, and neither one of them is ready to get married or take on that kind of responsibility.

10:43.091 --> 10:56.382
But they offer so much to each other that it's foolish not to, from their point of view, not to see whether that relationship is going to be an enduring one.

10:56.823 --> 10:59.665
Because I think it seems so easy to get divorced.

11:00.566 --> 11:02.968
It's another thing that is too bad.

11:03.623 --> 11:07.086
You make a commitment or you don't make a commitment.

11:07.106 --> 11:17.336
I'm going to ask you maybe one or two more questions, because I don't want you to get tired and weary, and I'd like to assess the material and maybe come back and go over a few more points.

11:17.356 --> 11:21.941
But this is the 25th anniversary, of course, year of the Goddard Library.

11:22.681 --> 11:27.786
And I wondered, how do you feel when you look at the library?

11:27.866 --> 11:32.871
How did you feel a sense of accomplishment?

11:34.927 --> 11:37.149
Because it is a monument in a way, isn't it?

11:38.411 --> 11:39.772
Yes, I suppose so.

11:39.832 --> 11:41.714
I don't think I've ever thought of it that way.

11:43.916 --> 11:47.800
It was a project, and it was done satisfactorily, I guess.

11:48.000 --> 11:53.686
A library is the lifeblood of an institution.

11:53.766 --> 11:56.409
I guess we should say that and acknowledge that.

11:58.811 --> 12:00.092
College really revolves.

12:00.112 --> 12:02.235
I mean, Harvard began with a gift of books.

12:03.256 --> 12:04.697
John Harvard gave his books.

12:05.285 --> 12:06.206
That's what he gave.

12:06.546 --> 12:13.392
And half his estate, which was modest, but, you know, when you think of Harvard, he gave his book.

12:14.133 --> 12:16.615
A library, really, isn't it?

12:17.155 --> 12:18.777
Oh, yeah.

12:20.498 --> 12:29.366
I guess I'm looking for some kind of a philosophical thought on that, if you have one.

12:29.386 --> 12:30.947
I don't think about it that way.

12:30.988 --> 12:34.971
I think about how it works, and how it works better,

12:35.272 --> 13:00.655
brought it up to date and what John Johansson is going to think of it when he sees some of the things that I think was going to close in eventually that walk through that wind tunnel that was designed so that the snow block would go right through there and that it would be a gathering place rather than a wall of china that people had to go around from all parts of the campus.

13:00.675 --> 13:03.878
That's why that was left open underneath there.

13:04.381 --> 13:06.123
It's not terribly practical.

13:08.046 --> 13:11.170
And in a sense, then, it's more of a pragmatic view.

13:11.190 --> 13:12.772
This is something that had to be done.

13:12.792 --> 13:21.904
You said you saw a place that needed help, and that's essentially satisfaction, I guess, that... Yes, I guess so.

13:22.004 --> 13:26.650
You perceived the need, and you set about doing it.

13:28.012 --> 13:33.679
And there it is, and it's a wonderful... Well, I think I'd made a mistake, and it was wrong.

13:34.216 --> 13:37.940
You didn't need a library or whatever else you wanted to talk about.

13:40.482 --> 13:55.017
Supposing I, which I did not do, and I don't know why, back a president, an incoming president that I didn't, I made a mistake and held out for it somebody that turned out to be a disaster.

13:56.999 --> 14:00.243
I've often thought about that.

14:01.464 --> 14:03.666
How do you reconcile that?

14:04.102 --> 14:12.936
You think about it, you think very carefully about how do you really know a person?

14:12.976 --> 14:15.580
It's like marriage a little bit.

14:16.080 --> 14:22.210
The best marriage that we have is Dick Traynor with Clark University.

14:22.230 --> 14:28.299
We are so lucky to have him because they complement each other.

14:28.840 --> 14:32.185
His ideas for Clark are what Clark is all about.

14:32.806 --> 14:34.588
And he can do it.

14:36.049 --> 14:42.595
Just as a point, back when you mentioned the word marriage, when were you with Milton married, by the way?

14:42.695 --> 14:43.135
What year?

14:43.155 --> 14:46.318
1936, Friday the 13th.

14:46.438 --> 14:48.780
Friday the 13th?

14:48.800 --> 14:49.161
Yeah.

14:49.181 --> 14:50.182
13 is my lucky number.

14:50.442 --> 14:51.623
I think it's my lucky number.

14:51.663 --> 14:55.586
My daughter, my first daughter, was born in the 13th.

14:55.606 --> 14:55.887
Really?

14:56.367 --> 14:57.168
Is it lucky for her?

14:57.608 --> 14:58.249
Lucky for her.

14:58.269 --> 15:01.952
She was born on the 13th hour of the 13th.

15:02.219 --> 15:03.781
That's 1300, I remember.

15:03.801 --> 15:05.444
That was my old Navy number.

15:05.464 --> 15:08.167
It's been lucky for her and lucky for us.

15:09.389 --> 15:10.831
Oh, it's a very lucky number.

15:10.851 --> 15:11.152
I love it.

15:12.694 --> 15:13.195
I really do.

15:13.275 --> 15:15.738
I've made it my lucky number.

15:16.639 --> 15:31.180
It's interesting how many times that we have, the night before we were married, we had a dinner at the hotel of the village in Great Barrington, where I lived, and this Milton took me home and let me out at the

15:31.598 --> 15:40.107
At our house, after the party, his indicator turned to 13,000 miles on his car.

15:40.127 --> 15:45.133
And he set the inn, as a lot of the wedding guests did.

15:45.153 --> 15:47.856
His room was number 13.

15:47.876 --> 15:56.305
And when I was showing horses, I never lost a crash if I had number 13, no matter what the horse did.

15:56.325 --> 16:00.830
I think we should perhaps end it on that.

16:00.850 --> 16:00.930
Yes.

16:05.197 --> 16:18.773
I think we've got some things about the library, because I'm a little unhappy still with this being a too personal profile.

16:20.034 --> 16:23.178
It is a too personal profile.

16:24.660 --> 16:31.928
We just made a statement that I'd be certainly willing to do, you say, what you've learned from Clark.

16:32.028 --> 16:33.450
But I think we covered those things.

16:33.911 --> 16:34.191
Yes.

16:35.234 --> 16:40.141
So that it just isn't a personal puff piece.

16:40.161 --> 16:41.142
I don't write puff pieces.

16:41.162 --> 16:42.083
I'm sure you don't.

16:42.103 --> 16:51.416
That's the worst thing I could think to say about it that would describe what Bob would say quickly, because I don't want to be in the position of, well, who does she think she is?

16:51.436 --> 16:52.718
Well, I'm writing the piece.

16:53.099 --> 16:54.941
Okay.

16:54.961 --> 16:59.247
You know, people can think what they want, and I stand by everything that I write.

16:59.567 --> 17:02.031
I would never write anything that I didn't believe in.

17:03.032 --> 17:04.414
I'm sure you wouldn't.

17:05.491 --> 17:13.260
And as I indicated before, and I'll say it while the tape recorder is running, I will go over this material with you.

17:13.340 --> 17:14.902
A lot of writers don't want to do that.

17:14.982 --> 17:20.668
They think their prose is chiseled in stone and it's sacred.

17:21.409 --> 17:25.053
I believe that writing is an evolving thing.

17:26.074 --> 17:29.318
And if something is wrong, you fix it.

17:30.639 --> 17:31.300
No problem.

17:31.320 --> 17:33.422
I'll shut that off.

17:33.863 --> 17:34.924
How can you say that again?

17:35.461 --> 17:37.664
Could you say that again, do you mind?

17:37.924 --> 17:55.166
For a long time, before I said yes to Milton Higgins, although I was, you know, pleased to be asked, well, I cared enough about him to come and live in Worcester, which seemed to me to be off the beaten track.

17:55.246 --> 18:05.198
And I think my ego depended on, at that time, on my living in some place like London or New York,

18:05.465 --> 18:09.330
here in Paris, or a big city.

18:10.332 --> 18:14.698
And I have found that there are fascinating people everywhere.

18:15.018 --> 18:18.243
I loved living in Worcester.

18:18.263 --> 18:21.567
Where had you proposed to you?

18:21.928 --> 18:23.029
In New York?

18:23.049 --> 18:24.191
That's a whole other story.

18:24.211 --> 18:25.452
That's a whole other story.

18:25.893 --> 18:28.236
It was when I was working in Stafford.

18:28.256 --> 18:28.637
Okay.

18:29.178 --> 18:31.781
Had you spent any time here at all prior to that?

18:32.202 --> 18:34.645
Well, I hardly heard of it.

18:37.814 --> 18:45.264
Yes, but I was being looked over at the same time, and some things I saw I didn't like at all.

18:47.026 --> 18:48.288
But that's another story.

18:48.749 --> 18:50.110
That's another story, yes.

18:52.554 --> 18:54.857
You do write letters to the editor, I guess.

18:55.558 --> 18:58.562
Well, I just started doing that, actually.

18:59.082 --> 19:00.444
This was recent?

19:00.845 --> 19:02.187
Yes, it was quite recent.

19:02.207 --> 19:06.252
What prompted that, occasioned action, I'd say?

19:06.721 --> 19:15.216
frustration and outrage, I think, about something like the Worcester Commons fashion outlet.

19:15.757 --> 19:19.764
That means that Worcester is common and the fashions are common.

19:19.965 --> 19:26.196
It's a terrible name for that kind of thing.

19:26.216 --> 19:31.345
And I asked for the proposal of Mr. Gladys that the

19:34.261 --> 19:36.904
Galleria be turned into a gambling casino.

19:37.584 --> 19:41.528
That's outrageous.

19:42.169 --> 19:46.893
I wrote a letter to the editor about that, which probably had an awful lot of comment on it.

19:48.054 --> 19:50.717
Did you see that one?

19:50.917 --> 19:55.021
I didn't, but I'm going to check it out.

19:55.041 --> 20:03.289
Well, the unfortunate part about that, from my point of view, and this is part of my philosophy, is that the favorable comments, and I haven't had anything else,

20:03.640 --> 20:10.286
have come by telephone, by letter, by speaking about it, by sending me copies and that kind of thing.

20:10.326 --> 20:12.869
They're all from my friends, same kind of people.

20:12.929 --> 20:18.834
I haven't had anything from Shrewsbury Street or the Great Bourke Valley or Plumley Village.

20:19.815 --> 20:28.263
And I think one of the great things about the new mayor, Mariano, is that he grew up in Great Bourke Valley.

20:30.665 --> 20:31.386
If he can

20:31.957 --> 20:54.837
I love a success story, and if he can, if he's big enough for the job, so that he's a role model, whether he likes it or not, and he can be a good one or a bad one, he can make or break a city, even though he has only limited figurehead, I think.

20:54.857 --> 20:57.120
That's very interesting.

20:57.341 --> 20:57.441
Okay.
