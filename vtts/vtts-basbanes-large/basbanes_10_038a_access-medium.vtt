WEBVTT

00:04.148 --> 00:05.250
It's right there, and it's funny.

00:05.490 --> 00:10.337
Why don't you, Father, say for the tape recorder who is speaking now?

00:10.737 --> 00:11.358
Okay.

00:12.560 --> 00:24.657
Father Arsenios of the Monastery of Atopedi on Mount Athos is about to speak about Mount Athos in Greek, and the translator is Father Isidore of the same monastery.

00:24.677 --> 00:24.797
Yes.

00:25.998 --> 00:31.286
And so, he was about to tell me about, Father was about to tell me what produced all this.

00:31.686 --> 00:32.147
Exactly.

00:33.899 --> 01:00.868
I would like to begin from the very beginning of civilizations, when one was living as a hunter, and his motive was to survive.

01:01.237 --> 01:09.185
Then he settled and he began working on the fields.

01:10.666 --> 01:17.213
Then he began creating social groups.

01:17.533 --> 01:28.003
Then he began creating social groups.

01:28.237 --> 01:37.969
And he began what we call civilization, that is the relationship between men in all kinds of levels.

01:40.673 --> 01:48.783
They had the need in order to exchange merchandise items.

01:50.105 --> 01:54.430
This socialization

01:54.747 --> 01:58.914
began to give beginning for the law and legislations.

02:00.777 --> 02:21.210
And then they organized

02:21.494 --> 02:24.898
let's say different civilization under a leadership.

02:26.800 --> 02:49.206
And so we have the various civilizations like the Egyptian one, the Chaldeans, the Chinese, later on the Islamic, the Byzantine, and what is called also the European also.

02:49.540 --> 03:16.206
which is a development of the Byzantine civilization which has as its origin the classical Greek people as well as the Romans.

03:16.372 --> 03:22.743
I would like more to speak about the Byzantine civilization.

03:24.105 --> 03:33.701
Because of that civilization, most of it is here.

03:33.961 --> 03:37.587
You know, here we have most of it Byzantine.

03:38.005 --> 03:43.600
When the president got here, how do you say most of it that has survived is here, right?

03:43.620 --> 03:44.923
You say most of it is here.

03:45.084 --> 03:47.490
Yes, no, it was a mistake for me.

03:47.530 --> 03:51.120
He said most of what we have here is Byzantine.

03:51.200 --> 03:52.403
Yes, okay.

03:52.923 --> 04:08.772
I mean only he says a small summary regarding all the other civilizations which is a big thing of course to speak about all these things.

04:09.241 --> 04:17.011
But regarding the Byzantine culture.

04:17.131 --> 04:27.404
Sir Stephen Rassiman, an English Byzantineologist.

04:28.825 --> 04:38.117
The Byzantines inherited the fine and delicate Greek sensitivity.

04:39.245 --> 05:05.353
in the arts etc, in the culture generally, as well as the civilization that the Romans developed later on, when the Romans first conquered Greece, and eventually they created the vast Roman Empire,

05:05.722 --> 05:26.032
For a lot of time he says, the Latin language was official language.

05:28.195 --> 05:33.703
The new doctrine of Christianity came from the East and

05:34.122 --> 05:40.851
He was united with the Greek spirit.

05:43.995 --> 06:01.699
As you know, religion and civilization is something which is very much intertwined.

06:01.949 --> 06:22.621
The old civilizations like the Chinese Egyptians and so on, they were actually worshipping the creation and whatever was in it.

06:23.822 --> 06:28.750
So we had innumerable days.

06:28.848 --> 06:45.343
For example, for the sun due to the benefits that he gives to man, they thought that it was a god.

06:46.424 --> 06:53.491
The Incas in America they used to worship the mountains.

06:54.012 --> 06:57.775
Their mind was thus

06:58.379 --> 07:01.362
came upon understanding what's above.

07:02.343 --> 07:26.648
Also in the ancient Greece we can also see that they had also the same ideas about the deities.

07:26.830 --> 07:45.799
But we had some very special people in Greece which they gave a different direction regarding metaphysics like Socrates and Plato who developed and transmitted his speech.

07:49.064 --> 07:53.952
He and Plato were talking about one God

07:54.607 --> 08:08.334
They believed that there was a pre-existence of matter.

08:08.655 --> 08:11.721
Matter was always there.

08:12.055 --> 08:16.659
And God is the idea of all goodness.

08:17.440 --> 08:18.020
Matter.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.161
Matter.

08:19.301 --> 08:21.083
Matter.

08:21.283 --> 08:21.984
Matter.

08:22.164 --> 08:22.544
Matter.

08:22.644 --> 08:24.766
I'm sorry.

08:24.906 --> 08:34.755
I just want to make sure when I listen to it.

08:34.935 --> 08:41.100
And so people, so how they used to say, should cultivate

08:41.620 --> 08:48.028
They are good things they have within them in order to be like God who is all good.

08:49.791 --> 09:05.271
And he was talking also about the four important virtues of man.

09:05.932 --> 09:09.957
One is called prudence.

09:11.185 --> 09:14.109
That's prudence, sofrosini.

09:14.169 --> 09:23.621
Fronissi means... Fronissi is... Fronissi is... Fronissi is prudence, wisdom.

09:24.822 --> 09:28.467
Fronissi has to deal with the purity of the body.

09:30.309 --> 09:30.790
Fronissi.

09:31.791 --> 09:39.741
Okay, the other way.

09:40.261 --> 09:55.418
Throneously is prudence or wisdom, whereas sofrosini is the purity of the body, of the senses, of the mind.

09:55.820 --> 10:01.547
Somebody likes to eat more than he needs.

10:01.987 --> 10:04.590
Or to drink and get drunk.

10:05.631 --> 10:14.121
The virtue of sofroxying to eat as much as he needs.

10:15.363 --> 10:16.885
And never to get drunk.

10:17.665 --> 10:23.312
On the matter of love.

10:24.102 --> 10:40.118
Somebody, a man would like to have a relationship with many women or the reverse, a woman with many men.

10:40.979 --> 10:49.587
But prudence teaches man that there are more spiritual pleasures and they are much more important than the lust.

10:50.343 --> 10:52.466
Now, prudence and wisdom are the same.

10:52.486 --> 10:55.912
Yes, he's using exactly prudence and wisdom in the same context.

10:56.633 --> 11:02.502
A third virtue is to be brave.

11:03.243 --> 11:04.465
Courage.

11:04.485 --> 11:04.926
Courage.

11:05.146 --> 11:05.547
Courage.

11:06.007 --> 11:18.747
In order to have the power, using prudence and

11:18.963 --> 11:32.825
in order to be, let's say, a boss of himself, if I may say so.

11:33.106 --> 11:33.626
In control.

11:33.767 --> 11:35.790
In control of himself.

11:36.371 --> 11:42.220
And the fourth one, the last one, is called justice.

11:43.043 --> 11:56.012
The four important virtues of the human soul.

11:57.054 --> 12:01.103
And are these principles of the Orthodox?

12:01.353 --> 12:10.346
He's about to come to that.

12:10.767 --> 12:25.909
It seems that Plato had studied the Old Testament

12:26.395 --> 12:37.832
Only the Jews had a very different religion than all the other nations.

12:37.852 --> 12:47.386
They were talking about one God who created the universe.

12:47.667 --> 12:53.095
They were talking about one God who created the universe.

12:53.665 --> 13:02.476
In some words in his books, actually in Psalms, I said, ye will become gods, ye are gods.

13:04.098 --> 13:16.433
Whereas King Solomon refers to these four features that we have just said, the way as Plato, later on.

13:17.223 --> 13:27.099
For the Jews, God wasn't the universe.

13:27.680 --> 13:40.581
And that is why they had a strict commandment not to create anything in order to represent deity or deities.

13:40.983 --> 14:00.504
For the Jews God was the mind which conceived the idea of creating the universe and everything in it.

14:00.985 --> 14:10.635
And in everything this God has given ordinances, laws and order.

14:10.818 --> 14:16.426
Since man is an image of God according to the Genesis.

14:16.626 --> 14:23.436
And we see that in the Old Testament it says that man can become like God.

14:23.796 --> 14:29.705
That's another similarity.

14:29.765 --> 14:34.612
Plato also said that man has been created in order to be like God.

14:34.632 --> 14:37.095
That's extraordinary, those similarities.

14:37.345 --> 14:58.813
It's a very substantial difference.

14:59.215 --> 15:14.562
Since God is a mind, and mind he means also spirit, and we are also actually mind, minds, he can have contact revelations between the God mind and the man mind.

15:15.945 --> 15:21.274
No, God since he is the creator, he knows

15:21.473 --> 15:25.237
Very well why he has created all these things.

15:25.377 --> 15:27.800
How he created everything.

15:28.360 --> 15:33.026
Which is the very purpose why he has brought everything into realization.

15:33.046 --> 15:44.578
And man, if he likes, if he prefers, if he chooses.

15:44.845 --> 15:52.432
and he expels a dark place, a dark thing from his heart which says, I know everything, the ego.

15:52.833 --> 16:04.804
It's what it says in the Old Testament descriptions that God goes against those who are proud in heart.

16:06.206 --> 16:13.553
Tote, πίστευαν οι Ιουδαίοι, και το ξέρουμε αυτό από τους προφήτες, ότι ο υπέρτατος νους δημιουργός

16:13.752 --> 16:28.891
And we know through the prophets, the many prophets of the old Israel, that God, the mind, was coming into a union with the mind or spirit of men.

16:29.312 --> 16:40.806
And he was giving them his wisdom, as much as they could understand during their

16:41.005 --> 16:51.798
period of time, their epoch, their era.

16:52.679 --> 17:10.962
Although God was giving them supernatural revelations, yet whatever they were writing or saying was limited to their cultural background

17:11.397 --> 17:21.571
and to the human abilities.

17:21.872 --> 17:28.521
That is why we have King Solomon when he was asked what would you like to be given by God, what would you like to be given?

17:29.562 --> 17:30.824
He asked wisdom.

17:34.890 --> 17:40.257
This is the very first power or virtue of the soul which comes

17:40.456 --> 17:43.281
together with Prudence.

17:43.782 --> 17:58.328
But certainly in this case Solomon didn't just receive wisdom but more than what we say wisdom.

17:59.430 --> 18:01.654
In Plato

18:02.191 --> 18:23.514
He conceived that man should become like God, but he couldn't comprehend, he couldn't grasp that God is a person and can talk to him, convey to him messages.

18:24.455 --> 18:30.021
He thought that it was the idea of good.

18:30.322 --> 18:49.599
But however, his teaching as well as of Aristotle, it was about virtue, on good.

18:50.120 --> 18:59.248
Their spirit was very much cultivated, so they became very noble men.

18:59.448 --> 19:17.051
So when Christ appeared, of course the Old Testament speaks very openly about the coming of the Messiah.

19:17.572 --> 19:28.206
The Greeks, many of them were very cultivated as characters and it was easy for them since

19:28.591 --> 19:39.005
God became man and was teaching them to grasp his teaching which was of high quality.

19:46.815 --> 19:57.889
Which the teaching of Christ is actually, he says, to imitate his behavior

19:58.190 --> 19:59.051
and his character.

20:01.675 --> 20:04.358
One to imitate Christ, to put it simply.

20:05.920 --> 20:11.287
This is his teaching.

20:11.468 --> 20:24.585
The two main virtues qualities that Christ taught them, one is humbondness, humility, and the other love.

20:25.645 --> 20:35.697
Humbleness fits to man because man is corruptible and he dies.

20:36.879 --> 20:53.239
Man can make many ideas and legends how the world may have come into existence and create dailies and things like that.

20:53.810 --> 21:23.530
but the one who says let me not try to find the solutions from my own mind it's better to say let me humble my spirit and say I know nothing and let me ask from God through prayer to tell me

21:23.813 --> 21:24.574
What is truth?

21:28.360 --> 21:33.007
This is what Abraham did.

21:34.789 --> 21:36.992
Whose father was an idolater.

21:37.313 --> 21:51.694
And yet, although he was coming from idolaters, through revelation, due to his humbleness, he came into conduct and known

21:52.079 --> 21:55.063
And he knew the real God.

21:55.103 --> 22:02.153
And he became the father of the nation that God loved and protected especially.

22:02.174 --> 22:11.867
And for him Christ came, Asimaran.

22:12.448 --> 22:22.002
But when Christ revealed himself, the people who was in the best readiness

22:22.285 --> 22:26.072
To understand him was the Greek one.

22:29.680 --> 22:42.184
Because their spirit was already cultivated, developed on the ideas of virtues, of good.

22:42.772 --> 23:07.682
The finest language which could convey high meanings and deep meanings was and is always, he says, the Greek one.

23:08.472 --> 23:14.960
It has a lot of potentialities in expression.

23:15.181 --> 23:16.502
Potentialities.

23:17.724 --> 23:21.809
Potentialities.

23:21.829 --> 23:26.455
To convey many messages in many ways and in deep ways.

23:30.961 --> 23:36.808
So when Christianity was spread in Greece, through the apostles,

23:37.092 --> 24:06.103
And if one reads the life of Christ and especially the Acts of the Apostles, the teaching about Christ was regarding humbleness and love, but it was

24:06.556 --> 24:11.883
ended to the union with the third person of the Trinity, the Holy Spirit.

24:12.805 --> 24:35.837
So for those people who were good and they had good inclination towards goodness, they had the gift to use

24:36.053 --> 24:44.262
the grace, the energy of the Holy Spirit.

24:44.743 --> 24:53.953
That is why they were always saying that the miracles that we are doing are not by us, but by the Holy Spirit.

24:54.794 --> 24:58.598
In the name of Jesus Christ.

25:01.161 --> 25:03.023
Christ is the truth.

25:03.425 --> 25:08.251
And the truth is not an idea.

25:08.431 --> 25:12.656
Because see we have thousands of ideas.

25:12.836 --> 25:15.579
And one collides to the other.

25:15.639 --> 25:18.142
And so what is truth?

25:21.126 --> 25:24.590
So truth is a person.

25:24.890 --> 25:31.778
And the only person who could be absolutely true is God.

25:32.973 --> 25:57.874
For this reason, the Orthodox Christianity was based on the imitation of Christ which is really the truth.

25:57.994 --> 25:59.537
That is why Saint Paul used to say

25:59.753 --> 26:07.906
be imitators of me because I imitate Christ.

26:08.207 --> 26:15.298
That is all of us, we have to become imitators of Paul, that is imitators of Christ.

26:15.650 --> 26:23.120
This is basically the rationale that leads to the production of these extraordinary artworks and manuscripts and books.

26:23.140 --> 26:32.894
Is this what we're saying?

26:34.736 --> 26:38.181
I'm sensing that this is what we're...

26:38.600 --> 26:47.232
This is what he is leading us.

26:47.293 --> 26:48.995
It was very natural.

26:50.057 --> 27:07.662
Since God is a creator and creates, and man is an image of God, thus he has the potentialities to create also.

27:08.317 --> 27:15.630
To create, it is something of his own substance.

27:15.650 --> 27:17.333
It is something which is coming out of him.

27:19.016 --> 27:20.378
This is excellent.

27:21.320 --> 27:25.768
This is what I was looking for.

27:25.968 --> 27:39.406
The most basic cause of man's attitude towards creating.

27:39.486 --> 27:44.112
Because he wants to be wise as God is wise and of course be very wisdom.

27:45.053 --> 27:47.637
And because God is love and he's creating out of love.

27:47.657 --> 27:50.881
And because God is love and he's creating out of love.

27:51.762 --> 27:55.367
And because God is love and he's creating out of love.

27:55.583 --> 28:01.469
And man also wants to do, to create out of love, as God is doing the same thing.

28:02.970 --> 28:04.272
But here we have a problem.

28:05.012 --> 28:06.754
Evil.

28:07.255 --> 28:15.803
Many Oriental religions, Asiatic, they believe that evil is a deity.

28:18.326 --> 28:24.392
But Christ has taught us that evil has no substance at all, does not exist.

28:24.727 --> 28:52.236
The evilness is created when human mind will give birth to conceive something evil and instead of expelling this out, he realizes it.

28:52.587 --> 29:11.247
evil was a deity then that would mean that all of us when we conceive an evil thought another deity stronger than us should force us to do evil.

29:13.369 --> 29:20.957
But we see that not all people are bandits or thieves and not all are killers,

29:21.325 --> 29:33.984
That means the conclusion is that some men have chosen to follow evilness.

29:35.806 --> 29:43.097
Now when Christianity was spread throughout the Roman Empire,

29:43.347 --> 29:57.446
Many groups of people couldn't grasp, couldn't understand the messages of Christ.

29:58.046 --> 30:05.997
This is because they never asked from God

30:06.567 --> 30:15.276
to have a revelation from above, but they were trying to understand the gospel according to their own mind framework.

30:15.296 --> 30:31.714
In 330 when the capital of the Roman Empire was transmitted from Rome to Byzantium,

30:31.930 --> 30:48.431
And Constantine was the very first emperor who accepted Christianity and the persecution stopped.

30:49.132 --> 30:59.085
Then the Greek people had the chance and the Greek spirit had also the opportunity to create

30:59.470 --> 31:15.212
extraordinary civilization, as it had happened in the golden days, in the classical Athens, the classical Greece, which of course was a period of paganism.

31:15.473 --> 31:25.848
Paganism, he means, it means adoration, worship of men, for men and martyrs.

31:25.868 --> 31:27.570
Now,

31:27.854 --> 31:35.144
Now the Greek spirit can worship the true God.

31:37.728 --> 31:55.313
So all this art that they produced is, he uses the word hyperbatical which means... It's something which goes to the supernatural, it attires to the supernatural.

31:56.390 --> 32:00.216
What was the word he used?

32:00.236 --> 32:04.722
We have to open up a dictionary.

32:04.902 --> 32:10.691
I'll get it with a big dictionary.

32:11.712 --> 32:13.054
We'll have it.

32:13.595 --> 32:21.447
This art now is dealing very much with the person with the personality.

32:21.887 --> 32:25.873
And especially with those that managed

32:26.123 --> 32:27.745
to become like God.

32:28.465 --> 32:44.382
Those who have maintained that, attained that, these are what we call saints.

32:44.542 --> 32:55.033
The Greek word Agios, it's from a word which means alpha, which means somebody who has nothing evil within him.

32:55.621 --> 33:09.158
And it is a commandment by God that all of us should be good because also in God there is no bad, no evil.

33:11.481 --> 33:25.459
So the whole Byzantine art is dealing with the personality and the person of Christ, his mother, the saints,

33:25.979 --> 33:36.213
and broadens to many kinds of arts.

33:40.279 --> 33:44.865
For example, the transmission of the word of God was very important through books.

33:45.655 --> 33:59.479
And although now the Greeks were worshipping God in this supernatural way,

33:59.712 --> 34:28.048
Steven Ransimann, who is an expert in this civilization, but also we still live within this very civilization, we can see that this civilization has preserved whatever art, knowledge, etc was before Christ,

34:28.518 --> 34:51.353
astronomy, geography, history, mathematics, all these arts and sciences were taught in the Byzantine Empire.

34:51.569 --> 35:11.046
But it was very natural that the arts and senses were very much oriented towards the worship of God the way it was revealed to them.

35:11.228 --> 35:17.097
in the Byzantine period they became much more noble than they used to be during the Roman times.

35:17.197 --> 35:28.714
For example he says the Incas they were making human sacrifices.

35:29.755 --> 35:32.359
Romans were throwing people into the lions.

35:32.761 --> 35:38.988
But in the Byzantine civilization we have no more things like that.

35:39.408 --> 35:53.943
The nobleness, the gentleness of man during the Byzantine period mounted at its peak.

35:54.904 --> 36:01.992
And even if we have a new Byzantine

36:02.225 --> 36:18.443
As we say regarding the classical art, we cannot have another period of that, but we should try to imitate it.

36:21.667 --> 36:23.749
We say something the same.

36:24.109 --> 36:31.978
We cannot become to gain that perfection that the Byzantilists went up there,

36:32.262 --> 36:36.089
But we're trying our best to be as much as close as we can.

36:36.129 --> 36:39.395
We can obtain the brilliance, the level of accomplishment?

36:39.415 --> 36:41.439
Yes, they have, exactly, exactly.

36:41.739 --> 36:45.225
But we can try to be as close as we can.

36:45.245 --> 36:47.790
So do we still do art?

36:48.985 --> 37:11.012
There were still artists working and... In Greece we have a new wave which is looking through and for this civilization.

37:12.374 --> 37:17.220
For us it is easier to find it because there are places

37:17.470 --> 37:19.072
in which this is preserved.

37:21.054 --> 37:25.319
For example, the monasteries libraries.

37:25.539 --> 37:31.606
The art, the painting in the main, the big churches of the monasteries.

37:31.906 --> 37:33.187
The Byzantine icons.

37:35.610 --> 37:38.353
The Byzantine manuscripts.

37:38.493 --> 37:41.757
All these are preserved here in Greece.

37:42.310 --> 37:58.854
And here especially on Mount Athos we have the worship and the life that the people used to have during the Byzantine times.

37:59.015 --> 38:03.060
This is the most important thing of all he says.

38:03.641 --> 38:09.550
Here he says something very extraordinary.

38:09.850 --> 38:17.130
in a remote and small corner of the Earth, we have Byzantium continuing through the years.

38:17.772 --> 38:20.138
Yes, that's so important.

38:20.178 --> 38:20.981
No, we have to leave.

38:21.923 --> 38:23.207
That's excellent.

38:24.390 --> 38:25.092
He said it.
