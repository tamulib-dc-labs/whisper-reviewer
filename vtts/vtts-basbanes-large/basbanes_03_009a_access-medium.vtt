WEBVTT

00:02.461 --> 00:08.289
We are recording, and we're speaking with Professor Helen Mendler in our office at Harvard.

00:08.310 --> 00:09.591
I'm just going to move this over there.

00:10.332 --> 00:14.178
And as you can see, I prepare a whole bunch of notes.

00:14.639 --> 00:21.649
And I am interested, I guess we start with, is the poem relevant in the 21st century?

00:22.911 --> 00:31.303
It will never not be relevant, because it's one of the evolutionary skills that we seem to, a certain number of us seem to be born with, just the way the composing of music

00:31.672 --> 00:36.356
is everywhere and will never stop, so the composing of poetry has been everywhere.

00:36.877 --> 00:45.365
But it's not something that most people can do, or can do well, any more than composing string quintets is something that most people can do or do well.

00:45.705 --> 01:01.560
There will always be a minor group of people, or a minority of people, maybe what Ruskin called the saving remnant, who will be able to do this and also to enjoy it, because there are, just as there are different levels of talents in composition, so there are different levels of appreciation.

01:02.452 --> 01:04.734
from children all the way up.

01:05.035 --> 01:15.366
One of the things I'm hoping to talk about in this new book is the power, the enduring power of books to continue to change the world or to change people.

01:17.649 --> 01:22.914
Poetry, obviously, has profoundly influenced and changed your life.

01:22.934 --> 01:30.923
Do you feel that poetry continues to have this power to influence the way... I think poetry is one of many streams.

01:31.578 --> 01:39.527
Every big change in the world, whether it's that we no longer hand-drawn corner people or whatever, we don't have public executions.

01:39.587 --> 01:42.731
I mean, there have been big cultural changes, the vote for women, whatever.

01:43.212 --> 01:59.931
All of these big changes that we undergo are not caused by any one thing, but the stream of ideas and feelings that are represented and expressed eventually changes the way people think about life and the way they respond to certain events in life.

02:00.603 --> 02:08.354
So that you can't say that Beethoven did it, gave women the vote, or that George Herbert did it.

02:08.374 --> 02:16.426
But the evolution of thought is contributed to by all forms of representation of human life.

02:16.987 --> 02:24.678
So that whether it's photography or poetry, people see their own lives reflected back at them from any of these media of representation.

02:25.219 --> 02:27.662
And eventually, somehow, cultures evolve.

02:27.923 --> 02:29.445
Nobody quite knows how.

02:29.999 --> 02:40.050
But then they make mistakes, like probably cutting off the king's head in England in 1649 out of fanaticism and religious enthusiasm.

02:40.090 --> 02:42.493
And then they sort of learn that isn't such a good thing to do.

02:43.494 --> 02:46.097
And so they don't cut off any more king's heads.

02:46.117 --> 02:59.972
But there were 11,000 pamphlets written during the interregnum when Cromwell was on the throne, so to speak, when everybody had his or her say about the way government should or should not be run.

03:00.323 --> 03:05.633
Who can say that mass of 11,000 pamphlets obviously was a huge outpouring.

03:05.653 --> 03:05.793
Sure.

03:06.394 --> 03:09.640
And they all had some effect, but we can't track those effects.

03:09.660 --> 03:10.582
You can't track them.

03:10.602 --> 03:12.947
There was an exhibition in London in 1963.

03:12.967 --> 03:16.052
It was called Printing in the Mind of Man.

03:16.313 --> 03:17.014
Are you familiar with that?

03:17.034 --> 03:17.335
No, I am.

03:17.355 --> 03:22.264
I'm starting this new book actually with kind of a, trying to recreate the ambience of that.

03:22.548 --> 03:28.756
And it is regarded as, by some people, as perhaps the most significant book exhibition.

03:29.577 --> 03:49.804
And what it was, was a collection of about 450 books that, in the humble opinion of those who curated the show, the 440 most important books, books that made things happen over the previous 500 years of printing, it was to commemorate the first 500 years of printing.

03:50.020 --> 04:02.499
books that made things happen, books that, shockingly, from my point of view, and I raised this with a few British scholars, you know, only one, two pieces of Americana in there.

04:02.999 --> 04:05.603
For instance, Uncle Tom's Cabin wasn't in there.

04:05.663 --> 04:08.387
I mean, Lincoln meets Harriet Beecher Snow in the White House.

04:09.108 --> 04:14.897
Apocryphal and I, he has said to have remarked, so this is the little woman, the little lady who

04:15.130 --> 04:21.740
You know, but the thinking was, well, they didn't read American books, you know.

04:21.760 --> 04:24.104
But they did have the Declaration of Independence in there.

04:24.144 --> 04:25.746
Thomas Paine was in there.

04:25.786 --> 04:28.210
They read him in England, but it was illegal.

04:28.250 --> 04:33.779
Well, they assume that political things make things happen, and that scientific things make things happen.

04:33.839 --> 04:36.242
I mean, there was Galileo, or there was Copernicus, or whatever.

04:36.723 --> 04:41.931
And there's a clear line of influence that can be traced, either from the founding document

04:43.058 --> 04:46.661
of democracy, I'd say, the Declaration of Independence.

04:46.681 --> 04:53.147
But they don't find it easy to trace the effects of more ephemeral meditations.

04:53.707 --> 05:07.439
I suppose that Yeats's poetry had some effect on the constitution of the Irish state, because he was the best-known writer, and expressed himself in letters to the editor, letters to friends, essays, poems.

05:08.300 --> 05:12.103
I mean, he wrote over 12,000 letters alone, for instance, on top of the

05:12.286 --> 05:14.348
poems and essays and letters to the editor.

05:15.009 --> 05:27.160
So presumably people's feelings and thinking about the state of Ireland were influenced by Yeats, Paul, or Conn, but nobody can quantify that in any way.

05:28.442 --> 05:35.769
Even if you can or cannot quantify it, you still can assess, perhaps, sense the impact.

05:35.869 --> 05:39.272
I mean, there were six works of fiction in there, which is very interesting.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.302
Cervantes was in there.

05:41.442 --> 05:43.364
Of course, Pilgrim's Progress was in there.

05:44.145 --> 05:47.368
Utopia was in there as a work of fiction.

05:48.109 --> 05:56.878
And they had the, even though it wasn't, it didn't emerge in the age of print, there were printed editions, and they argued that it influenced, you know, any number of writers.

05:56.918 --> 05:58.880
The Iliad and the Odyssey, of course.

05:58.940 --> 05:59.881
Milton was in there.

06:01.663 --> 06:03.445
Would you... Well, who could say what?

06:03.465 --> 06:04.446
Who could say?

06:05.327 --> 06:08.230
Yes, certain writers read Milton, either

06:08.513 --> 06:18.846
intemperately like Blake, or appreciatively like Wordsworth, or perplexedly like Keats, who said life to him would be death to me.

06:20.849 --> 06:24.313
So you feel a strong response of those other poets.

06:24.553 --> 06:26.696
I just want to make sure those little numbers are working.

06:26.716 --> 06:27.257
That's fine.

06:27.277 --> 06:30.180
You do feel a strong response of those other poets to Milton.

06:31.001 --> 06:31.162
Perfect.

06:31.182 --> 06:32.063
That's fine.

06:32.083 --> 06:36.208
But probably if Milton had a political effect, it was during the years he was being

06:36.577 --> 06:42.903
essentially the Secretary of State for Cromwell, and running the foreign policy for the Commonwealth.

06:45.106 --> 06:51.012
Other than poets, people had Milton lying around the house, but I think he was more honored than read.

06:51.953 --> 06:59.260
And people have many such books lying around the house.

06:59.280 --> 07:02.263
There's a Bible lying around the house, and how many people actually read it.

07:02.952 --> 07:08.581
There are certain phrases you have to write down, even though on tape it's more honored than read.

07:08.601 --> 07:14.490
Yes, well, I think that's the case of, as you know, a lot of the bestsellers.

07:14.650 --> 07:16.313
People buy them and they never read them.

07:17.555 --> 07:30.495
Well, your colleague here at Harvard, Dylan Gingrich, who produced a book called The Book That Nobody Read, and it's an ironic battle, but the suggestion was, Arthur Kessler, I guess it was, who said, this is probably the most

07:30.712 --> 07:33.296
significant book that nobody has ever really read.

07:33.376 --> 07:35.339
And so Owen says, well, is that really true?

07:35.399 --> 07:35.959
And he goes out.

07:35.979 --> 07:36.961
He tracks them all down.

07:37.021 --> 07:38.483
He tracks them all down.

07:38.503 --> 07:40.646
And he tries to see the annotations that were in it.

07:40.946 --> 07:42.429
You know, I find that very important.

07:42.489 --> 07:43.370
That is interesting, yes.

07:43.390 --> 07:44.191
That is interesting, isn't it?

07:44.531 --> 07:51.301
But again, that is a work of novel scientific ideas.

07:51.361 --> 07:56.008
So it's like the, you know, the double helix.

07:57.049 --> 07:59.132
Everybody had to read the double helix.

08:00.040 --> 08:04.869
who was in the field of biology, the field of physics, the field of chemistry, you couldn't not read it.

08:05.029 --> 08:14.987
So there are indispensable books like that in science, because the field can't progress without taking that into account.

08:15.688 --> 08:21.559
But I don't think you could say that the field of the novel couldn't have progressed if

08:21.893 --> 08:23.855
Saul Bellow hadn't written Augie March.

08:23.875 --> 08:26.978
Of course it would have progressed, because it progresses on many fronts.

08:26.998 --> 08:30.622
It progresses as a literary form, as a artistic form.

08:30.842 --> 08:33.765
I'm also interested in terms of making things happen.

08:34.266 --> 08:43.175
You could argue almost that To Kill a Mockingbird, especially as translated into a film, transformed into a film.

08:43.195 --> 08:47.479
It was a remarkably effective way of raising the consciousness.

08:47.898 --> 08:48.859
people on civil rights.

08:48.879 --> 08:52.342
I don't know if that's... But how would you know whether their consciousnesses were raised or not?

08:52.642 --> 08:54.644
I mean, you could say so many people saw the movie.

08:54.664 --> 08:59.288
If that doesn't prove that anybody's consciousness was raised, maybe people just enjoyed the movie.

08:59.308 --> 09:05.614
You're looking for proof, aren't you, that something actually made... How about Rachel Carson's Silent Spring?

09:05.634 --> 09:07.416
I mean, you can't quantify that, perhaps.

09:07.436 --> 09:15.103
I think it was probably one of a stream of things, just the way Uncle Tom's Cabin had been preceded by a very active abolitionist movement.

09:15.370 --> 09:42.897
with enormous intellectual force, magazines, newspapers, prominent Brahmins behind it, clusters and nodes of political maneuvering by the abolitionists, so that you might say the ground gets prepared, and then the book brings it into public view when it's been, you might say, a splinter group, so that

09:43.163 --> 09:56.458
for instance, the acceptance of homosexuals was brought into public view by the Stonewall Riots, but there had been lots of incremental steps in which less and less were the sodomy laws applied.

09:56.478 --> 10:01.443
England got rid of the, by the Wolferton Report of its sodomy laws.

10:01.884 --> 10:08.491
And then you have the sort of public manifestation after the thing has accreted enough of a swell to spill over.

10:09.172 --> 10:11.314
But often the public manifestations are not

10:11.547 --> 10:13.989
You might say as important as the ground preparing was.

10:14.810 --> 10:22.078
The abolitionist movement, I think, was probably more important than Uncle Tom's cabin, even though that elicited a public response.

10:22.758 --> 10:27.083
But if you hadn't had an organized political movement with smart intellectuals behind it, you know.

10:27.403 --> 10:28.424
Well, they were ready for it.

10:28.444 --> 10:29.585
They were ready for it, yes.

10:29.646 --> 10:31.808
And there's a lot of ground preparing that goes on.

10:32.669 --> 10:35.592
And then something happens.

10:35.612 --> 10:38.795
There's not going to be a great book to make, you know.

10:38.895 --> 10:38.955
No.

10:39.104 --> 10:59.209
If you walk into the Goddard Library at Clark University, past presidents and friends over there, they have a blow-up on the wall, this little pamphlet, and it was just a paperback, printed in 1922, I'm not sure about the year, but Robert S. Goddard with a title, On the Feasibility of Attaining High Altitudes.

10:59.229 --> 11:00.891
Oh, the lots of business, yeah, yeah.

11:00.911 --> 11:06.538
And this book was reviled, condemned, ridiculed by the New York Times and all organizations.

11:06.558 --> 11:06.698
Really?

11:06.982 --> 11:10.667
apologized in print in 1969 as Apollo was heading.

11:10.927 --> 11:13.610
Of course, Gaudet was dead by that time.

11:13.710 --> 11:14.411
But nobody read it.

11:14.451 --> 11:15.232
It was ridiculed.

11:15.573 --> 11:16.574
World War II ends.

11:16.674 --> 11:17.635
Pretty well documented.

11:17.736 --> 11:21.400
We capture our German scientists, Wernher von Braun, among them.

11:21.420 --> 11:23.603
They said, where did you learn so much about this stuff?

11:23.623 --> 11:25.726
And they said, well, you should ask your own Dr. Gaudet.

11:25.946 --> 11:26.847
We read his books.

11:27.299 --> 11:34.728
Not just that little book there, obviously, but his articles and all of his public domain patents and things like that.

11:34.748 --> 11:35.810
But Goddard was the guy.

11:36.030 --> 11:37.152
It didn't matter how many people.

11:38.013 --> 11:43.460
No, in science, if it's true, it eventually gets reinvented if it has to be.

11:43.640 --> 11:50.148
I mean, if Goddard had, if his book had languished on read, somebody else would have been discovering rocketry pretty soon.

11:50.208 --> 11:55.635
And there are cases, and I can't think of any offhand, where research has been done but totally lost.

11:55.987 --> 12:00.192
And somebody else comes to it in a totally independent way.

12:00.212 --> 12:08.042
Sure, it's like Mendel, and then they pick up genetics and sort of discover him back there, having done his sweet beats or whatever.

12:08.743 --> 12:12.968
But yes, that's why it's so hard to say what has happened in culture.

12:12.988 --> 12:17.213
I don't know how many people have read Don Quixote as far as that goes, at least not all the way through.

12:17.494 --> 12:20.998
Again, that's one of these books that people have on their bookshelves.

12:21.097 --> 12:24.601
Especially the second pocket, you know?

12:24.621 --> 12:24.721
Yeah.

12:24.761 --> 12:25.903
You might read a lot of the first.

12:25.943 --> 12:29.607
How many people read Beyond the Inferno when they get into time?

12:29.627 --> 12:30.127
Exactly.

12:30.608 --> 12:46.446
So to say these are important books, they are important because they've been canonized by subsequent writers who love Don Quixote, who love Montano, who love Dante, and read the whole thing and see the whole new possibilities being opened up for literature.

12:47.017 --> 12:51.582
buy these books that invent a new way of writing, which is in effect what all those books do.

12:52.302 --> 12:54.324
Nobody had written like Montaigne before Montaigne.

12:54.344 --> 12:58.969
If you look back to the classical essay of Seneca or something, nothing sounds like Montaigne.

12:58.989 --> 13:07.157
So when writers see that, then of course the stock goes up very high, but most people wouldn't be able to judge that.

13:07.738 --> 13:12.142
Most people don't know enough about writing to say this is a new way of writing, even.

13:13.163 --> 13:16.787
Do you think that the influence of a great writer sometimes

13:17.122 --> 13:28.837
is measured by, I'm not praising this properly, but I guess perhaps you need a critic, perhaps you need a mediator to explain the significance of the writer.

13:28.857 --> 13:29.418
Yes, sometimes you do.

13:29.438 --> 13:30.800
I'm thinking of Elman and Joyce.

13:31.000 --> 13:31.240
Sure.

13:31.260 --> 13:35.286
I mean, I haven't read Joyce, I have to confess, but I've read Elman.

13:35.466 --> 13:35.786
Yeah.

13:35.867 --> 13:39.631
And I think I understand him through Elman.

13:39.651 --> 13:42.796
Well, I do think brokering is necessary, otherwise we would all be out of business.

13:44.017 --> 13:46.200
I know, seriously though, it helps to read

13:46.973 --> 13:52.239
especially when you're young, something about a mysterious book that opens it up for you more.

13:53.240 --> 14:04.473
And I think that, as Frank Ramone said in his essay, What is a Classic?, books that many generations can relish.

14:05.914 --> 14:09.679
Maybe it's only many generations of writers who have relished Montaigne.

14:10.319 --> 14:16.086
Maybe it's only many generations of fiction writers that have liked Don Quixote.

14:16.420 --> 14:21.052
But then the prestige accrues to the books because they do not fade.

14:21.994 --> 14:25.182
They are still delightful hundreds of years after they're written.

14:26.004 --> 14:29.292
And most books are not delightful hundreds of years after they're written.

14:29.312 --> 14:31.257
On the contrary, they're boring and dated.

14:32.367 --> 14:41.921
When you think of interpretation and also in terms of, and I read in one of the interviews that you did, one of the first writers that you discovered was Baudelaire.

14:42.242 --> 14:42.462
Mm-hmm.

14:42.482 --> 14:44.906
Now, did you discover Baudelaire in French or in English?

14:44.926 --> 14:53.499
No, actually, I knew French at the time, but my parents would not have had a volume of Baudelaire in the house in terms of the French books that were in the house.

14:53.519 --> 14:54.139
Far from it.

14:54.740 --> 15:01.210
And I think all they thought would have been on the bookshelf of my parents, but they did have Mark Van Doren's.

15:01.645 --> 15:05.149
Anthology of World Poetry, and it was translated into English there.

15:05.609 --> 15:16.582
And, of course, the flavor of Baudelaire's damnation sort of aura was there even in translation.

15:17.242 --> 15:20.085
And it was in Chattanooga that I read.

15:20.106 --> 15:21.227
I couldn't believe there was a poem.

15:21.247 --> 15:23.549
Do you know that one about the carcass rotting by the side of the road?

15:24.130 --> 15:27.754
And then he says, and even you will come to this, my beauty, you know?

15:28.223 --> 15:33.068
Well, it was strong medicine, and I didn't know poetry could say things like that.

15:33.528 --> 15:55.311
But I'm just wondering, is it essential to really appreciate a work, like I'm thinking of Blake, you know, who teaches himself Greek and Hebrew and Italian and whatever, and so he can experience the classics in their original language, and for purposes of not only for enjoying them, but to illustrate them.

15:56.388 --> 16:00.574
Again, that kind of brings in the role of the mediator, doesn't it, of the poker, as you say?

16:00.594 --> 16:04.199
There are many things I can only read in translation, and I'm very grateful to the translator.

16:05.080 --> 16:17.718
On the other hand, I would, on the whole, I've occasionally done this, but on the whole, I wouldn't presume to set myself up as an authority on some author that I've only read in translation, because too much is missing.

16:18.519 --> 16:22.885
And so that you could say certain things about the subject matter,

16:23.337 --> 16:27.423
But you can't say much about the style if it's not a language you don't read.

16:27.884 --> 16:30.968
How could I talk about the style of Mandelstam of Tsvitaeva?

16:31.449 --> 16:32.391
That would be impossible.

16:33.072 --> 16:34.934
But you could still appreciate the writer.

16:35.195 --> 16:40.523
You could see some of the things they're doing in terms of content.

16:40.543 --> 16:45.190
And if you don't mind if I bounce around on a few of these questions, by the way.

16:45.210 --> 16:47.132
I have a number of things in here.

16:48.795 --> 16:49.977
Follow them up when you think of them.

16:51.960 --> 16:52.180
Pardon me.

16:53.189 --> 17:01.981
Seamus Heaney says that he regards you as the, what's the exact quote, the finest close line reader.

17:03.103 --> 17:05.826
Could you explain what he means by that?

17:05.846 --> 17:07.168
The phrase that he used.

17:07.809 --> 17:15.079
Well, I don't like the phrase close reading, though it has currency.

17:15.500 --> 17:18.244
The best close reader of poems to be found?

17:19.946 --> 17:20.567
Yes.

17:20.587 --> 17:21.508
I would think that

17:22.703 --> 17:33.698
to use the phrase close reading, which people don't understand, because they say, well, I can read too, and I can understand everything that James King said in this poem, or whatever.

17:34.359 --> 17:36.843
But poems have, you know, about 15 levels.

17:37.564 --> 17:40.788
And at first they have the simplest, the phonetic level.

17:41.509 --> 17:50.922
And then you go up to the grammatical level, you go up to the syntactic level, you go up to the arrangement of images level, you go up to the propositional content, and

17:51.323 --> 17:54.065
statements as severations, what have you.

17:54.426 --> 18:04.635
You go to the emotional level where questions are different from exclamations, both are different from declarative sentences, both are different from vocatives, whatever.

18:05.335 --> 18:16.605
And then you go to, from a poem, the context, as I see it, is the other poems in the same volume, and then the other poems written by that poet.

18:16.625 --> 18:18.327
It's a series of concentric circles.

18:18.967 --> 18:20.689
So there's this Seamus Heaney poem.

18:20.939 --> 18:27.247
Around it are the other poems in that volume by Seamus Heaney, written within the same five or ten years.

18:27.287 --> 18:49.174
Then you go out to the other volumes, and eventually you go out to influences on Heaney and so on, so that when you read a single poem, all of these things are reverberating, and you see how they mesh, how the phonetic is meshing with the grammatical, how the images are meshing with the syntax, how the

18:49.508 --> 18:59.840
propositions that are being asserted are being undermined by certain tones of voice in the poem, perhaps, that you register that are in contrast to the separations.

19:00.601 --> 19:18.503
And you feel that certain words have great weight, certain images have great weight, because you've read other poems by that poet, so that the words shimmer and resonate, and even the syntax shimmers and resonates, because you know it from other poems, so that you see more in a poem

19:19.293 --> 19:24.043
because you're bringing so many levels of awareness to bear.

19:24.845 --> 19:28.592
Whereas most people just bring a single level of awareness, what does this poem say?

19:29.214 --> 19:33.062
And they treat it as so it were an essay with a topic sentence and things following.

19:33.082 --> 19:40.457
Now you've said that you don't necessarily believe that knowledge of the biography of the poet is necessary to

19:40.758 --> 19:45.745
Well, if it were, it would be too bad, because we don't know anything about Shakespeare.

19:45.765 --> 19:46.125
That's right.

19:46.145 --> 19:47.367
And that's an excellent answer.

19:47.387 --> 19:48.909
You said that in the same interview.

19:49.189 --> 20:04.911
However, having said that and agreeing with it, and in particular where you, as a scholar, have researched the lives of Keats and Wallace Stevens and Yeats, does it matter to you to know, for instance, what they read, the books that mattered in their lives?

20:06.072 --> 20:06.793
It depends.

20:06.813 --> 20:08.976
It certainly... Does it give you some insight into their...

20:09.344 --> 20:19.217
Well, when you see, I'm first looking into Chapman's Homer, and you can see that Keats has been reading the Odyssey, it would be a mistake not to take that into account.

20:19.938 --> 20:33.216
And when he writes a poem called I'm Sitting Down to Read King Lear Once Again, you have to take that into account so that there's a lot that's explicit that they answer back.

20:33.236 --> 20:36.621
They often respond to their own poems.

20:36.721 --> 20:38.423
I mean, Milton writes to Ben Zoroso.

20:38.707 --> 20:40.549
as a response to his own L'Alegro.

20:40.709 --> 20:44.874
It would be too bad to read Il Panceroso and not to have read L'Alegro.

20:44.894 --> 20:57.989
So I think, for me at least, usually I, sometimes I've encountered an author through a biography, but mostly I encountered them in my youth through anthologies.

20:58.950 --> 21:05.097
And they didn't have, in anthologies in those days, they had no biographical information to speak of.

21:05.837 --> 21:07.279
And so there were all these poems

21:08.137 --> 21:10.880
that had no life history attached to them.

21:11.381 --> 21:21.793
Then, if I liked the poems, I would go and get, I would find out about the life history, I would go find pictures, whatever, but that was all subsequent to the attachment to the words, yeah.

21:22.573 --> 21:35.308
Now, I know that for many people, a biography comes first, and the life interests them, and as somebody, say, a fellow Jesuit might read A Life of Hopkins and think, I never knew the order had a poet before,

21:35.508 --> 21:46.201
and go out and read Hopkins as the work of a fellow Jesuit, or people might read political things for that reason, or Protestants read Milton for that reason.

21:46.221 --> 21:50.607
They thought that he was equivalent of the Bible, so to speak, and he was there.

21:50.627 --> 22:01.060
And another interview you mentioned, I guess reading the reviews of Eliot, for instance, you said it doesn't matter at all what he's writing about the poem, because it's

22:01.512 --> 22:04.376
It appears to be something that he would like to do.

22:04.516 --> 22:06.579
Further himself, in himself, yes.

22:06.679 --> 22:31.435
They're all manifestos disguised or not, but poets write prose because they have such a strong orientation towards the world and a strong orientation towards expression that their expression must carry their sense of literary preference or

22:31.837 --> 22:40.027
literary urgency, what is important that should be written now, or what is wrong about what is being written about a particular topic.

22:41.068 --> 22:45.494
You mentioned elsewhere also that Yeats was your first real book about a poet, I guess.

22:45.514 --> 22:45.714
Yes.

22:45.734 --> 22:50.280
And it's interesting also that Yeats wasn't in your household.

22:50.300 --> 22:50.620
No, no.

22:51.481 --> 22:53.584
This is kind of an independent discovery of yours.

22:53.604 --> 22:58.890
Well, actually, I kept wondering

22:59.461 --> 23:06.148
why I had not written a book on Hopkins, who was the first poet that I memorized with great intensity.

23:07.289 --> 23:12.054
And... Don't mind me, I'll just... I set up straight at least.

23:12.074 --> 23:16.298
I said wonderful pictures, and my wife is the editor, so... All right.

23:16.979 --> 23:18.160
We don't let anything go through.

23:18.180 --> 23:19.021
It's not nice.

23:19.161 --> 23:20.523
Don't mind me.

23:20.543 --> 23:23.766
You can talk while I'm shooting.

23:23.926 --> 23:24.827
But I, um...

23:25.516 --> 23:32.142
I realized I'd never written a book on Hopkins, because I wrote my senior thesis in high school on Hopkins, and I had just memorized all of Hopkins.

23:33.884 --> 23:39.750
We had a senior thesis to write.

23:39.830 --> 23:44.034
It was supposed to be 16 pages or something, and I wrote 42 pages on Hopkins.

23:45.976 --> 23:48.198
So I had had my say on Hopkins.

23:48.278 --> 23:49.299
I didn't need to have.

23:50.140 --> 23:54.544
I had worked that all out in my head and had my say, even in a very amateurish way.

23:54.963 --> 24:04.437
But that impulse to communicate what you thought had already been exhausted in me with respect to Hopkins, even if on a very amateur, childish level.

24:05.058 --> 24:11.207
So I later wrote an article on Hopkins, two articles on Hopkins, but the push to write a book wasn't there.

24:12.408 --> 24:24.666
When we had our first conversation a few years ago, you said then that one of the reasons you had never written about Shakespeare before, and the only reason that you were writing about the sonnets and not the plays, is you

24:25.135 --> 24:29.661
paraphrasing, but you didn't feel worthy to invoke Shakespeare.

24:29.681 --> 24:31.563
Well, no, you'd have to know a lot before you read.

24:31.583 --> 24:42.598
I mean, who could possibly know more than, I don't think, obviously you must know as much about Shakespeare as 99% of the people out there.

24:42.618 --> 24:53.792
Yes, but one has one's own criteria of when it is appropriate to be able to say something without doing an injustice to the author.

24:54.295 --> 25:19.680
A lot of people swoop down on a single poem, especially by politically active poets like Gates or Ginsburg, and they swoop down on one poem that suits their purpose, and they quote it in some article, and they get it all wrong because it's the only thing they've read by Ginsburg or Rich or Yates, but so that you feel the thinness that's behind the utterance of someone who doesn't know the thing through and through.

25:20.461 --> 25:21.602
So until you...

25:22.645 --> 25:27.510
have worked hard enough on it, you don't feel you have any right to say anything.

25:27.530 --> 25:29.331
It's just like foreign policy or something.

25:29.552 --> 25:37.879
People can spout all they want about what we should be doing in Iran without knowing anything about, I mean, in Iraq, sorry, without knowing anything about Iraq or knowing the language or the culture.

25:38.240 --> 25:39.461
Probably Iran, too.

25:39.881 --> 25:50.411
Yes, but I can imagine a specialist in foreign affairs looking at these letters to the editor in op-ed thinking, they have no right to say anything about what's going on.

25:50.451 --> 25:51.252
They don't know enough.

25:51.704 --> 25:54.690
And that's the way I often feel about myself.

25:54.890 --> 25:56.253
I mean, I don't know enough yet.

25:56.914 --> 26:02.846
Well, and to jump back to the influence of poetry.

26:02.866 --> 26:03.227
In the world?

26:03.307 --> 26:03.848
In the world.

26:03.908 --> 26:08.397
You had mentioned elsewhere that in Japan, children are required to memorize

26:08.748 --> 26:15.084
I guess the top 100... Yeah, I was told that that may have been 15 or 20 years ago.

26:15.325 --> 26:17.009
I don't know if it's still going on in Japan.

26:17.029 --> 26:17.912
Well, I'm going to check up on it.

26:17.992 --> 26:18.353
Check it up, yeah.

26:18.373 --> 26:25.812
It is pretty interesting that they take this approach to... because it does relate with what you say elsewhere about...

26:26.365 --> 26:31.272
and your Jefferson speech, I think, creating a sense of patrimony.

26:31.312 --> 26:34.356
And how else do you preserve it and pass it on?

26:34.596 --> 26:35.157
Exactly.

26:35.177 --> 26:37.661
I mean, it's not that hard.

26:37.721 --> 26:39.503
Children can be taught to memorize anything.

26:39.523 --> 26:43.188
So it's just a question of the value the culture puts on something.

26:43.909 --> 26:55.225
And we have had such spectacular successes, as I said, too, in that lecture in science and in technology, that they glitter in front of us

26:55.627 --> 27:01.516
And it's hard to see anything but that as our patrimony, along with, quote-unquote, democracy.

27:01.576 --> 27:04.120
We all know the compromised form of democracy we have.

27:04.740 --> 27:13.213
But when you say to people, what's special about the United States, they will say democracy, and then they will say something like,

27:13.497 --> 27:19.024
science, technology, all of that, all the way up to the atom bomb and genetics and everything else.

27:19.705 --> 27:21.908
But I don't think they say anything else about America.

27:21.968 --> 27:23.710
Nobody says, we have such wonderful music.

27:23.770 --> 27:25.532
Nobody says, our great painters.

27:25.572 --> 27:27.334
Nobody says, our great poet.

27:27.355 --> 27:28.716
And our painters are wonderful.

27:28.736 --> 27:29.197
Of course.

27:29.517 --> 27:33.943
And there's no sense that that's the culture that they're living in.

27:34.864 --> 27:41.192
So I do think, I mean, it is blinding the achievements of science and technology at the moment.

27:41.898 --> 27:48.104
And it is identified with America, simply because we are so rich, and we had almost, as you said, flowering scientists.

27:48.224 --> 27:52.168
There's a new book just out by a colleague of yours here at Carver.

27:52.188 --> 27:55.731
Her name escapes me at the moment, but she's a neurologist.

27:55.751 --> 27:58.474
The Midnight Disease, you know the book I'm talking about?

27:58.514 --> 27:59.976
Writer's block, I guess.

27:59.996 --> 28:02.098
Oh, I read something about it in the Gazette, yes.

28:02.118 --> 28:03.319
So I'm looking at it, reading it.

28:03.339 --> 28:04.039
It's pretty interesting.

28:04.400 --> 28:11.787
But she does mention how she reads obsessively, and as a scientist, she said, maybe this is my pay-in to the

28:12.188 --> 28:18.535
to the printed book, because none of her colleagues in the sciences do use books anymore.

28:18.555 --> 28:18.976
No.

28:18.996 --> 28:19.717
They're online.

28:19.737 --> 28:20.838
The journals are online.

28:22.119 --> 28:23.200
Is it possible for books?

28:23.221 --> 28:32.891
You went forward to talk about the double helix or whatever that has to be dealt with by scientists, I guess.

28:32.912 --> 28:35.675
Do you think that will continue to be the case?

28:36.055 --> 28:38.578
I think that was essentially a popularization.

28:38.638 --> 28:41.301
All the biologists already knew about the double helix by the time

28:41.770 --> 28:43.633
Watson wrote it.

28:43.653 --> 28:47.018
And he and Crick and Franklin had done the work long before.

28:47.078 --> 28:55.491
So I'm sure it had been in all the scientific journals for some time before he actually wrote the book that popularized it.

28:56.152 --> 29:06.107
But I do think that the popularizing of science, which is a wonderful enterprise and necessary, and is often extremely well done, needs to keep going.

29:07.248 --> 29:09.111
And in that sense,

29:10.222 --> 29:16.092
I'm not sure how you would get people to feel that something was popular that was online.

29:16.112 --> 29:16.753
Maybe they would.

29:17.474 --> 29:25.588
Our notion of popular is the bestseller list or big reviews in important places, and then you might buy the book or get it from the library.

29:25.648 --> 29:34.744
But if it's online, maybe with this younger generation, their notion would be to go, they read a review of it and read it online, if it were online.

29:35.399 --> 29:39.062
Now things aren't put online right away, so that they can have a sale, a hard cover sale.

29:39.242 --> 29:44.167
I argue in my last book, Patients and Fortitude, which are the names of the lions, by the way.

29:44.187 --> 29:44.587
Yes, yes.

29:44.607 --> 29:47.269
Sometimes think it's a lost Jane Austen novel.

29:47.289 --> 29:49.191
Patients and Fortitude.

29:49.211 --> 29:52.494
Well, actually, one person wrote and said, I don't have a copy of your Pride and Prejudice.

29:52.654 --> 29:53.895
I don't know if they'd swear.

29:53.915 --> 29:55.417
Oh, isn't that funny?

29:55.957 --> 29:56.798
But those are the lions.

29:56.878 --> 29:57.438
Yes.

29:57.839 --> 29:59.780
Nice image, I thought.

29:59.800 --> 30:00.361
Where was that called?

30:00.381 --> 30:02.923
Do you know the call about that by Walter Stevens?

30:02.943 --> 30:03.163
No.

30:03.203 --> 30:05.085
The vegetation still bounds in forms.

30:05.335 --> 30:10.646
Oh, no, don't tell me I missed exactly something I could have used there.

30:10.666 --> 30:14.013
Oh, yeah, well, I'll look for it in a minute, but anyway.

30:14.033 --> 30:15.035
It's a good poem.

30:15.356 --> 30:17.060
Do you use patient support?

30:17.120 --> 30:19.505
Do you refer to the lion?

30:19.565 --> 30:26.179
Yes, he talks about the things that people put outside of banks and libraries and things like that.

30:26.581 --> 30:29.465
Yeah, I'm just trying to remember the... Do you want me to find it?

30:29.485 --> 30:31.368
I have them looking everywhere to find that.

30:31.388 --> 30:31.748
Really?

30:32.069 --> 30:34.812
Why is it that people put lions in front of the libraries?

30:34.912 --> 30:38.938
I mean, I don't have... Well, the lion probably does stand for fortitude.

30:38.958 --> 30:44.185
I mean, the four cardinal virtues, as you know, are prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance.

30:44.205 --> 30:47.169
And it's justice, fortitude, and temperance.

30:47.189 --> 30:49.092
Those are the four cardinal virtues.

30:50.474 --> 30:56.402
And I think prudence was thought of more as a...

30:57.530 --> 30:59.112
It was something that bankers did.

30:59.272 --> 31:02.837
But fortitude was thought of as very useful for the Christian soul and so forth.

31:03.338 --> 31:06.562
And justice was thought of as very important for the welfare of society.

31:07.043 --> 31:17.296
So justice and fortitude are the ones that tend to get foregrounded as public signs rather than... But of course, the names came by chance at the New York Public Library.

31:17.316 --> 31:19.219
He was a male LaGuardia.

31:19.239 --> 31:22.082
He used to get his Sunday night addresses.

31:22.102 --> 31:23.204
And he named the line?

31:23.224 --> 31:26.288
Well, he used to... He would barely end his Sunday night

31:27.112 --> 31:35.162
by saying what we need to see us through the great ordeal that lay ahead, to exercise the twin virtues of patience and fortitude.

31:35.182 --> 31:36.083
Patience and fortitude.

31:36.103 --> 31:38.746
Prior to that, the lions were Aster and Lennox.

31:39.006 --> 31:41.169
They didn't have any, you know, patrons.

31:41.449 --> 31:51.081
But I'm thinking more in terms of the actual use of the lion, the lion as a metaphor, as more than a metaphor, as a guardian.

31:51.101 --> 31:57.068
You know, the British Library, the British Museum has lions, the Chicago Art Institute has lions, the Morgan Library has

31:57.284 --> 32:00.367
What is it about the lion as a guardian of knowledge, I wonder?

32:00.667 --> 32:03.330
Well, I think you think you're a little, yes, probably, yeah.

32:03.450 --> 32:06.793
I think probably that's one of it anyway, one of them anyway.

32:06.813 --> 32:08.075
Only I can remember the title.

32:08.115 --> 32:08.956
I don't find it.

32:08.976 --> 32:10.297
It's Wallace Stevens as good, doesn't it?

32:10.317 --> 32:12.219
It certainly is Wallace Stevens.

32:12.239 --> 32:15.722
I don't think it's too late to get it in the paperback.

32:16.543 --> 32:18.345
That's the kind of thing I'll put up on my website.

32:18.605 --> 32:19.286
Yes.

32:19.306 --> 32:21.308
Courtesy of Ellen Velland, do you mind?

32:21.708 --> 32:21.928
No.

32:22.769 --> 32:26.633
If you have to get a snob, I think it was okay, not me.

32:27.068 --> 32:40.340
I love your line, critics and scholars are evangelists.

32:40.541 --> 32:41.241
Yeah, I do.

32:43.123 --> 32:47.927
You really do kind of need your champion, don't you, if you're a writer?

32:48.328 --> 32:55.995
Well, a poet who will remain nameless said to somebody who told me, I don't have a critic.

32:56.465 --> 33:03.133
And he sort of meant as his patron or as his sponsor in the public mind.

33:03.774 --> 33:06.016
And I think that's too bad.

33:06.037 --> 33:08.059
Here we are.

33:08.119 --> 33:10.021
Lions in Sweden.

33:10.041 --> 33:10.642
Oh, wow.

33:11.003 --> 33:12.604
You will love this.

33:12.624 --> 33:13.285
Lions in Sweden?

33:13.305 --> 33:15.007
What page is it on there?

33:15.027 --> 33:16.449
124 in the collected poems.

33:17.430 --> 33:25.560
And he's saying that these are sovereign images, and they meant a lot to people in the past.

33:25.928 --> 33:27.851
these images of the cardinal virtues.

33:28.912 --> 33:35.321
But now that's all faded and gone, and they're not relevant to us anymore, or they don't resonate in the way they used to.

33:35.361 --> 33:46.335
And he thinks of these animals that represent an alliance and so forth as belonging to a kind of zoo of allegorical images from Christianity, Judeo-Christian tradition, and so forth.

33:46.355 --> 33:47.977
And he thinks, well, we need a new zoo.

33:48.438 --> 33:49.219
And he thinks that

33:49.570 --> 33:53.935
about the Hamburg group that Ducy apparently did some drawings of or something.

33:54.256 --> 33:55.998
That's why he mentions Hamburg at the end.

33:56.419 --> 34:00.203
And it ends the sovereign images.

34:00.544 --> 34:02.306
I'm not going to put them in my poems.

34:02.346 --> 34:03.447
They're no use to me anymore.

34:03.708 --> 34:05.871
But we still hanker after the sovereign images.

34:06.351 --> 34:09.335
And then he ends up, we're going to get, we can send back the old ones.

34:09.355 --> 34:10.336
We're going to get the new ones.

34:10.356 --> 34:10.937
Could you read it for me?

34:10.977 --> 34:11.237
Sure.

34:11.257 --> 34:11.317
No.

34:11.778 --> 34:13.440
It would feel wonderful.

34:13.580 --> 34:14.261
I could use it.

34:14.762 --> 34:15.983
Lions in Sweden.

34:17.205 --> 34:18.987
No more phrases, Swenson.

34:19.895 --> 34:40.906
I was once a hunter of those sovereigns of the soul and savings banks, fides, the sculptor's prize, all eyes and thighs, and galled justitia, trained to poise the tables of the law, patientia, forever soothing wounds, and mighty fortitudo, frantic face.

34:40.926 --> 34:45.733
But these shall not adorn my souvenirs, these lions, these majestic images,

34:46.557 --> 34:52.243
If the fault is with the soul, the sovereigns of the soul must likewise be at fault, and first.

34:53.364 --> 34:56.968
If the fault is with the souvenirs, yet these are the soul itself.

34:57.949 --> 35:08.281
And the whole of the soul, Swensen, as every man in Sweden will concede, still hankers after lions, or, to shift, still hankers after sovereign images.

35:09.402 --> 35:15.028
If the fault is with the lions, send them back to Monsieur Dufys Hamburg whence they came,

35:15.548 --> 35:20.212
the vegetation still abounds with forms.

35:20.232 --> 35:21.373
Want me to hear it?

35:21.393 --> 35:21.894
Do you mind?

35:21.974 --> 35:22.214
No.

35:24.576 --> 35:26.158
Isn't that perfect?

35:26.298 --> 35:30.742
And you know, I already see how I'm starting the scene.

35:30.762 --> 35:31.743
Come in again.

35:31.763 --> 35:32.424
That was wonderful.

35:32.544 --> 35:33.244
Thank you.

35:33.284 --> 35:36.107
You're welcome.

35:36.247 --> 35:36.848
Thank you.

35:36.948 --> 35:38.229
We're doing very well here.

35:41.011 --> 35:43.834
So I guess, I don't mean there to

35:44.557 --> 35:53.830
But what a person you're interested in, as a writer who has read, is of marginal interest to you?

35:54.411 --> 35:55.032
It depends.

35:55.092 --> 35:58.076
There are writers that you cannot read unless you know the Bible.

35:58.717 --> 36:07.008
For instance, so many of the African American 19th century poems come straight out of, especially Exodus, because that was a popular text.

36:07.870 --> 36:10.453
You can't read Dante without knowing the Bible and St.

36:10.473 --> 36:11.695
Thomas Aquinas.

36:12.181 --> 36:14.344
at least, at the very least, on St.

36:14.384 --> 36:19.891
Augustine probably too, so that there are indispensable books for certain writers.

36:20.812 --> 36:26.940
But you don't get that much, for instance, out of reading the prototype for Romeo and Juliet.

36:27.140 --> 36:30.865
It's a nice little Italian story, and he did change it.

36:31.065 --> 36:33.528
So if you want to know what he added, you want to read it.

36:33.969 --> 36:41.158
But it doesn't, it's not essential to your enjoyment of Romeo and Juliet that you should have read the story he cooked it from.

36:41.864 --> 36:57.423
For instance, as a person interested in this sort of thing, I think it makes sense, for instance, for me to go to Cambridge University and see Isaac Newton's library, you know, or Leonie Dell has kind of put together Henry James's reading.

36:57.543 --> 36:58.224
Reading, yes.

36:58.404 --> 36:59.926
And that is so much to him.

37:00.046 --> 37:06.494
They've done Emily Dickinson's reading, too, and they've done, um, I mean... Have they done it at Dickinson's?

37:06.514 --> 37:06.634
Yeah.

37:06.654 --> 37:07.696
How do they put that together?

37:07.876 --> 37:09.077
Library or whatever?

37:09.097 --> 37:11.280
Again, references in her letters, references...

37:11.682 --> 37:14.205
magazines that they know she took.

37:14.785 --> 37:19.971
She wrote at least one poem in response to an article by Thomas Wentworth Higginson and The Dial.

37:20.111 --> 37:29.000
They've put it together, and they've put together... Stephen's Library is out in the Huntington.

37:29.020 --> 37:32.965
Many people have this checklist of his books that his wife didn't destroy.

37:33.025 --> 37:36.869
I mean, she gave some of them away, and she destroyed some of them.

37:36.889 --> 37:38.991
But what's left is a checklist.

37:39.031 --> 37:40.913
Did he annotate to Glory Heavenly?

37:41.264 --> 37:42.085
Not much, no.

37:42.425 --> 37:47.911
And he just was put inside the back file, page 32, page 44.

37:48.492 --> 37:52.096
And he didn't like to deface books, clearly.

37:52.116 --> 38:01.907
And so I think it is interesting for people who have a kind of philosophical interest in the mind of the poet.

38:02.268 --> 38:08.875
What they're interested in is the consciousness of the writer rather than the independent works.

38:09.310 --> 38:19.767
And when they write on the consciousness of a writer, they will often use a line from this poem and a line from that poem, and then a paragraph from a letter, and then some comment by a critic.

38:19.867 --> 38:23.532
So you'll never see the beautiful thing itself whole.

38:24.274 --> 38:27.439
And my interest is always in the beautiful thing itself whole.

38:27.459 --> 38:31.385
So I can't bear to quote only a stanza of something.

38:31.425 --> 38:33.388
I want people to see the whole thing.

38:33.628 --> 38:37.174
When you think of Coleridge and his stuff down at Yale, I mean, the annotations,

38:37.390 --> 38:40.033
Oh, yes, the marginalia are incredible.

38:40.053 --> 38:41.815
And they're good enough to be published, as you know.

38:41.835 --> 38:42.695
And they are being published.

38:42.715 --> 38:44.177
Yes, they're being published, yes.

38:44.197 --> 38:44.758
Is it Princeton?

38:44.778 --> 38:46.459
There's a whole line of them, yes.

38:46.619 --> 38:57.391
I'm quite eager to get on, and I will at some point to get on, not to be a scholar in these, but a lot of people are doing that.

38:57.411 --> 39:00.013
Do you know Seamus Heaney's poem called The First Gloss?

39:00.253 --> 39:01.795
No.

39:02.011 --> 39:05.195
They were lovely gulf bosses, of course, in the medieval manuscripts.

39:05.576 --> 39:09.561
There's a lovely little poem in which the monk writes about his cat.

39:09.601 --> 39:11.503
You know that one?

39:11.583 --> 39:12.625
I have to show you that, too.

39:12.645 --> 39:13.626
That's been translated.

39:15.568 --> 39:24.079
But in the Hindi, it's in a section called Sweeney Redivivus.

39:24.660 --> 39:25.822
And it's about being a rebel.

39:26.703 --> 39:30.027
And instead of being...

39:30.395 --> 39:32.838
a nice copier in the scriptorium.

39:33.760 --> 39:49.281
It's called The First Gloss.

39:50.402 --> 39:59.895
It's called The First Gloss, and it's in a sequence called Sweeney Redivirus, which, if I'm correct,

40:00.938 --> 40:12.051
Here it is.

40:12.071 --> 40:12.431
Yes.

40:12.451 --> 40:26.187
It's in the volume called Station Island, and I'll be right back.

40:26.858 --> 40:39.333
Well, there's another wonderful poem in the sequence called The Scribes.

40:40.133 --> 40:43.878
Are you interested in... I'm shameless.

40:44.178 --> 40:46.621
In a savage little poem?

40:46.641 --> 40:47.422
Yes, I am, yeah.

40:48.323 --> 40:56.072
Well, Heaney was vilified by a lot of his fellow writers in the North for moving to the South.

40:57.757 --> 40:59.699
in 1971 or two.

41:00.420 --> 41:10.871
And he was much the most famous of them, and so attracted, and how kind and nice he is, beautiful source of envy.

41:12.012 --> 41:19.039
And so he represents himself as a monk in the scripturalium talking about his fellow scribes.

41:25.766 --> 41:26.667
Here it is, the scribes.

41:27.575 --> 41:31.339
The wonderful poems.

41:31.359 --> 41:35.162
These poems really are alive for you, aren't they?

41:35.202 --> 41:37.244
They are indistinguishable from life.

41:37.264 --> 41:41.929
They are really, it was a wonderful title of a book, Books Are Not Life But Then What Is.

41:42.009 --> 41:51.978
It was a collection of minor journalistic criticism, and I love the title of the book, Books Are Not Life But Then What Is.

41:52.399 --> 41:57.143
Well, I think that I, as you probably have seen, I said in another one of those interviews or one of them,

41:57.663 --> 42:00.567
My mother used poems in this way.

42:00.768 --> 42:01.348
I haven't.

42:01.368 --> 42:04.713
And just followed them in the middle of the class, and I didn't know until later.

42:04.733 --> 42:05.154
I didn't know it.

42:05.354 --> 42:07.938
No, I mean, they were, for her, part of her language.

42:08.519 --> 42:11.443
And so, for me, too, they're part of my language.

42:11.463 --> 42:27.467
So it's more than, some might argue that poetry is innate, but it seems also that the influence from your parents, your father knowing multiple languages, and your mother constantly quoting poetry,

42:28.662 --> 42:36.433
Yes, it was partly, but my sister had exactly the same training, you might say.

42:37.194 --> 42:47.368
She was two years older than I. And it didn't take.

42:47.909 --> 42:54.518
So, I mean, I think it has to be, it's like musical training, too.

42:57.248 --> 42:58.910
You know, my every daughter writes poetry.

42:58.951 --> 43:00.553
See, I don't know where she got that from.

43:00.593 --> 43:01.294
She had a friend.

43:01.434 --> 43:02.456
She's graduated from college.

43:03.037 --> 43:05.240
She sends her a poem for her birthday.

43:05.260 --> 43:10.568
And my wife said, you take a look at Nicole's poem.

43:10.588 --> 43:14.434
And I said, Nicole, this is very good.

43:14.574 --> 43:15.495
Where is it coming?

43:15.515 --> 43:17.418
Well, they've always read books in the house.

43:18.480 --> 43:19.942
Well, naturally, yes.

43:20.282 --> 43:25.450
But did it take more with one than with another?

43:25.902 --> 43:30.010
My older daughter, Barbara, went to Smith, and she worked in the library.

43:31.113 --> 43:32.656
My younger daughter went to Sweet Brush.

43:32.676 --> 43:33.999
She worked in the library.

43:34.019 --> 43:34.640
That's right.

43:34.660 --> 43:35.001
She worked there.

43:35.021 --> 43:37.045
And Barbara is now French literature.

43:37.145 --> 43:39.129
She's getting her master's over there.

43:39.450 --> 43:40.813
So they got literary attention.

43:40.853 --> 43:43.017
Nicole's applying to library school as well.

43:43.334 --> 43:44.796
Not that she wants to be a librarian.

43:44.856 --> 43:48.140
She wants to work in film and film preservation, and why not?

43:48.160 --> 43:55.369
But also, if somebody in the house is doing it, it doesn't seem mysterious or undoable, because my parents would teach us to seem natural to be a teacher.

43:55.409 --> 43:56.330
It wasn't frightening.

43:56.811 --> 43:57.792
It wasn't intimidating.

43:58.433 --> 44:03.499
This, incidentally, is from the same sequence, and they're talking about influence.

44:04.000 --> 44:07.924
I thought this was written about Yeats, the masters they've written.

44:07.944 --> 44:09.126
He said it was about Milosz.

44:09.667 --> 44:12.430
So this is a concrete illustration of somebody.

44:12.815 --> 44:15.658
having an influence on some other poets.

44:17.179 --> 44:20.503
And I'm not asking you a lot of biographical things, because I have that.

44:20.523 --> 44:21.324
Yeah, I have that, yes, yeah.

44:21.344 --> 44:23.085
And I'm a very long time going over things.

44:23.206 --> 44:28.151
And I thought that interview, which is just put up in Humanities, the major, have you seen that yet?

44:28.171 --> 44:28.471
Yeah, yeah.

44:28.491 --> 44:28.751
Cole?

44:29.152 --> 44:31.454
Yeah, the... I got it off the internet.

44:31.474 --> 44:37.420
You know, they're supposed to send me more of these, but they haven't yet.

44:37.580 --> 44:38.221
Have you seen?

44:38.241 --> 44:40.043
This is the whole kit and cajolo.

44:40.123 --> 44:41.404
Oh, I'll get one of these, yeah.

44:42.127 --> 44:49.096
The lecture isn't there, but the interview with two Coles.

44:49.236 --> 44:53.081
Oh, you have the interview with Bruce Cole and with Ali Cole, both in there.

44:53.722 --> 44:55.124
Oh, I don't have this Bruce Cole.

44:55.324 --> 45:03.054
You know, it's also the interview with Ali Cole and many pictures of my family once in another.

45:03.074 --> 45:04.015
I love you, yeah.

45:04.956 --> 45:05.417
There we are.

45:05.457 --> 45:05.757
That's me.

45:11.605 --> 45:11.685
Wow.

45:11.705 --> 45:11.965
Proud parent.

45:12.653 --> 45:14.735
So two girls and a boy?

45:14.795 --> 45:15.676
Boy, yes.

45:15.696 --> 45:16.297
I was in the middle.

45:18.159 --> 45:18.680
That's great.

45:18.700 --> 45:24.286
The old family pictures are really, really fun.

45:24.306 --> 45:25.567
Yeah, no, I've noticed.

45:25.587 --> 45:26.649
I'll have to do a search.

45:27.049 --> 45:28.391
The booth call thing ends up.

45:28.411 --> 45:30.092
You'd think the unreadful thing would be on my screen.

45:30.873 --> 45:33.436
Well, you'd think so, but they, you know, they have a word in their mouth.

45:33.897 --> 45:35.538
Stuff they won't digitize, so.

45:38.001 --> 45:39.623
I'm sorry, so let me just think of...

45:40.092 --> 45:41.894
I hope I'm not taking up too much time here.

45:41.914 --> 45:43.897
No, no, absolutely no place I have to be.

45:43.977 --> 45:44.298
I'm fine.

45:44.918 --> 45:46.240
Talk about canons here.

45:47.181 --> 45:50.386
I want to talk to Dan Aaron, for instance, and the Library of America.

45:50.406 --> 45:55.733
I mean, this whole idea of the canonization of American literature, deciding what is canonical.

45:55.793 --> 46:00.879
And is this something that you think critics do, or is it something that happens over?

46:00.899 --> 46:03.323
No, it's something that other writers do.

46:03.463 --> 46:05.205
If a writer doesn't interest other writers,

46:05.472 --> 46:10.798
He can have published 37 volumes, and they will all just moulder in the library, and nobody will ever want to read them again.

46:11.399 --> 46:11.999
Other writers?

46:12.159 --> 46:12.780
Other writers.

46:12.820 --> 46:15.363
They're the ones that found and continue the canon.

46:16.745 --> 46:19.848
Well, that's very important from my standpoint, isn't it?

46:19.868 --> 46:20.889
Yes, yes, I think so.

46:21.870 --> 46:29.278
Because you have to be doing something that other writers admire, and they, the best poems of every century are kind of pulled out of the air.

46:30.119 --> 46:34.264
They were hanging there in the air, only they were invisible to everybody except the person who pulled them down.

46:34.750 --> 46:43.884
And so that it seems almost inevitable that somebody would have written, let's say, Paradise Lost or the Divine Comedy.

46:43.924 --> 46:45.125
It was all just waiting there.

46:45.145 --> 46:54.700
Hell, purgatory, heaven, all the doctrines, all the scholasticism, Virgil as the poet who was the psychopomp that can take you down to hell and everything.

46:55.461 --> 46:56.402
It was all just there.

46:57.003 --> 47:00.388
And so was the vernacular when everybody else was writing in Latin.

47:00.448 --> 47:01.129
But it took...

47:01.615 --> 47:06.402
It takes some kind of courage to reach up into the air and pluck down one of those clouds and make it real.

47:07.263 --> 47:10.028
And other writers don't admire that very much.

47:10.368 --> 47:19.722
There are little canon makers, a good review, you know, a good review that praises the book, or a teacher who puts the book on the syllabus.

47:20.403 --> 47:24.129
But again, that won't last if writers don't admire the person.

47:24.149 --> 47:24.970
That has to be writers.

47:24.990 --> 47:25.791
It has to be writers.

47:25.871 --> 47:27.033
Isn't that, I've not heard that.

47:27.053 --> 47:28.155
Well, it's like composers.

47:28.756 --> 47:31.099
It's composers who admire other composers.

47:31.535 --> 47:33.198
artists who admire other artists.

47:34.641 --> 47:41.172
So when things are rediscovered, like Melville is forgotten in his lifetime, I mean, he's ridiculed.

47:41.232 --> 47:42.354
Melville Dick is reviled.

47:42.375 --> 47:44.238
It's a disaster here.

47:44.258 --> 47:44.458
Right.

47:44.518 --> 47:46.903
How does that all of a sudden become the great American novel?

47:47.343 --> 47:52.092
How does Emily Dickinson fail to get published in her lifetime and is an ally of her?

47:52.595 --> 47:54.978
Well, she refused to be published in her lifetime.

47:55.038 --> 47:57.140
Well, Higgins had had something to do with that, too, didn't he?

47:57.160 --> 47:57.581
Well, yes.

47:57.641 --> 48:05.570
I mean, he, but her friend Helen Hunt Jackson kept wanting to publish her and wanting to pick a volume that wrote Ramona.

48:06.090 --> 48:09.314
And Dickinson just stiff-armed her, all the attempts.

48:09.614 --> 48:15.261
And so that, you know the poem that begins, publication is the auction of the mind of man.

48:17.303 --> 48:21.488
How public like a frog, et cetera.

48:22.953 --> 48:25.637
What happens is that Melville is very much admired, e.g.

48:25.837 --> 48:27.219
by Hoffman, a fellow writer.

48:27.880 --> 48:33.307
He's also admired by the other writers in New York that he knows and the editors and so on.

48:34.268 --> 48:40.777
Then he has that trough that happens to most poets and writers after they die.

48:41.138 --> 48:42.640
They somehow go under for a while.

48:43.361 --> 48:48.288
Just the way Eliot doesn't have anywhere near the prestige now that he had back in the 40s and 50s.

48:48.828 --> 48:49.790
There is that trough.

48:50.370 --> 48:51.492
And then there's a sifting.

48:52.248 --> 49:04.179
And the professionalization of literary study means that if somebody says, I am in 19th century novel, that he will go out and read a lot of novels that are relatively forgotten or whatever.

49:04.659 --> 49:15.389
Then if he sees that something seems to him unduly neglected, he will then go and edit Billy Budd or something, as indeed was done from the manuscript that was lying around at Houghton or wherever.

49:16.089 --> 49:20.754
And then there's another push forward, and it could be happening from a scholar.

49:21.574 --> 49:22.255
But I think

49:22.690 --> 49:26.294
The scholar was excited for the same reason that Hawthorne was.

49:26.935 --> 49:30.038
There's something there that anybody interested in writing was great.

49:30.158 --> 49:31.980
Because he was a dedicated movie text.

49:32.000 --> 49:32.741
Yes.

49:32.761 --> 49:35.024
Yeah, but still, I mean, clearly.

49:35.925 --> 49:39.448
They knew each other, and he scared Hawthorne to death, and so on.

49:40.009 --> 49:42.071
Do you know the poem he wrote about Hawthorne?

49:43.032 --> 49:46.937
Hawthorne he calls fine in his long poem, Clairol.

49:47.377 --> 49:51.702
It wasn't published long after his death, and longer than paradise lost twice as long.

49:52.222 --> 49:56.629
that Melville wrote about the Holy Land and whatnot, and there are many characters.

49:56.669 --> 50:01.337
They all take different religious positions through Claral, and one of them is called Vine, and it's clearly half-born.

50:01.437 --> 50:06.685
I mean, the name, so obviously.

50:06.705 --> 50:14.017
And then... A beautiful poem, Melville, called Monody.

50:14.638 --> 50:19.225
To have known him, to have loved him, after loneliness long.

50:19.981 --> 50:24.586
And then to be estranged, he says, and neither to be in the wrong.

50:25.407 --> 50:27.450
And it's baffling to him that they are estranged.

50:28.250 --> 50:33.777
And he then talks about the grave of Botha, a very beautiful poem.

50:33.797 --> 50:36.620
And the estrangement clearly wounded Melville so much.

50:36.920 --> 50:48.874
So when you get something like the Library of America and this attempt at publishing a canon, what do you suppose, is it editors and critics, or are they listening to

50:49.445 --> 50:55.133
In the early stages, when they were restoring to print works, it had fallen totally out of print.

50:55.153 --> 50:55.774
That's true.

50:56.295 --> 51:09.895
But often they were very well-known authors, so that Edgar Allan Poe has a role in the history of American literature, but his literary criticism had not been anthologized the way the poems had been.

51:09.915 --> 51:14.041
So they restore a piece of Poe, but they don't invent Poe.

51:14.182 --> 51:17.106
And some of the works are there not for

51:17.407 --> 51:20.591
literary reasons so much as for political ones, like the Jefferson volume.

51:20.671 --> 51:27.278
I mean, yes, Jefferson is a good writer, but nobody thinks of him as one of the stars of, you know, American fiction or poetry or whatever.

51:28.299 --> 51:31.303
Except the Declaration of Independence is in the printing of the mind of that.

51:31.543 --> 51:38.491
But that's more for impact, of course, than... Sure, and also, Lincoln should be there for all the same reasons.

51:39.092 --> 51:46.620
But then, it's interesting, since the canonical works tend to be the best works,

51:47.292 --> 51:51.617
A lot of people might have read Moby Dick without reading Billy Budd, or certainly without reading Clarol.

51:51.657 --> 51:54.380
God knows anybody but me, I think, has read Clarol.

51:54.400 --> 51:55.281
And Melville's gone.

51:55.301 --> 51:56.142
I haven't read Clarol.

51:56.222 --> 51:56.943
It's wonderful.

51:57.664 --> 51:59.065
Clarol, I haven't read it all.

51:59.085 --> 51:59.586
Clarol, yes.

51:59.606 --> 52:00.487
Well, it's worth a look.

52:01.368 --> 52:05.472
Wonderful descriptions of the Dead Sea and the desert and the Holy Land.

52:05.492 --> 52:07.855
They sent him off to the Holy Land because they thought he was crazy.

52:08.195 --> 52:09.737
Having a nervous breakdown probably was.

52:11.419 --> 52:14.903
But what they do then is surround

52:15.271 --> 52:22.944
You might say the canonical work, the work that has gained him a place in the pantheon of American literature as a serious and much admired writer.

52:22.984 --> 52:26.170
Then they put everything else around it, the letters and the prose.

52:26.751 --> 52:30.076
And so people who really want to binge on the writer can have the whole thing there.

52:30.717 --> 52:34.744
So it's a little different from saying this is the canon of American literature.

52:37.248 --> 52:39.372
What it is is canonical works.

52:40.162 --> 52:44.389
and canonical authors surrounded by the penumbra of their lesser works.

52:44.570 --> 52:46.442
And one thing they are doing recently

52:47.283 --> 52:48.264
Anthologizing.

52:48.444 --> 52:52.069
Yes, that nice two-volume 19th-century one that Howard did.

52:52.089 --> 52:56.974
They've done a few things on baseball, writing about Americans in Paris.

52:58.016 --> 52:59.838
Yeah, it's not enough to make a whole thing.

52:59.978 --> 53:03.021
It's not enough to make a whole, but they just say, well, there's some work, too.

53:03.162 --> 53:04.043
I like that, too.

53:04.123 --> 53:04.824
I do, too.

53:05.024 --> 53:07.347
They have three little poetry volumes, by the way.

53:07.667 --> 53:10.751
Yes, I'm supposed to do one of them, but I haven't decided which one.

53:10.771 --> 53:12.913
But those are very handy to put on your pocket.

53:12.933 --> 53:13.734
I just love that program.

53:13.754 --> 53:15.076
I have every one of those books.

53:15.456 --> 53:15.857
Do you?

53:16.097 --> 53:17.138
At the very beginning.

53:17.320 --> 53:22.865
He wrote articles about it, and I've just been a great fan.

53:22.885 --> 53:28.970
You know, and of course they miss on some, and they maybe exaggerate on others.

53:29.211 --> 53:32.574
But still, it's wonderful that you can endow it.

53:32.714 --> 53:35.576
Oh, no, it's like a fayad.

53:35.616 --> 53:39.079
I mean, it's a very good thing to have around the model, yes.

53:39.099 --> 53:46.686
Do you think it's necessary for someone like Shakespeare, you know, talking about canonical writers,

53:47.003 --> 53:49.625
to have a new edition of their work, say, for each generation?

53:49.666 --> 53:52.448
Does every generation demand a new Shakespeare?

53:52.468 --> 53:58.714
Well, Shakespeare, as you know, is a mess, in that there are all those quartos out there, as well as the first folio and so on.

53:59.375 --> 54:02.838
And even the first folio needed editing in the long run.

54:03.278 --> 54:10.085
So that when you have a mess, there'll be somebody every generation who thinks he or she has the gift to straighten out the mess for good.

54:10.825 --> 54:16.791
And John Berryman spent a long time trying to figure out the editorial

54:17.395 --> 54:25.608
correctness for King Lear, because there's so much that doesn't overlap in the folio and the quarto, and the text is so difficult.

54:26.168 --> 54:31.056
And now people have decided there are two King Lears, as you know, probably in the last whatever it is, Oxford or something.

54:31.657 --> 54:34.221
So I think where there's a mess, there will always be editors.

54:34.421 --> 54:36.504
That's another form of people.

54:36.584 --> 54:38.347
I don't know what they did in prehistoric times.

54:38.367 --> 54:44.837
I mean, when the poets were chanting and the artists were drawing on the caves, the editors must have been doing something, but I don't know what.

54:45.121 --> 54:47.264
But they are very great people sometimes.

54:47.344 --> 54:50.768
I mean, the great editors are great people, I think, and we need them.

54:51.149 --> 54:59.340
And the great collected editions, the great Wordsworth edition, the great Yeats edition, now the manuscripts, they're dispensable.

54:59.760 --> 55:05.388
So in those cases where the author has the final say, it's fine.

55:05.428 --> 55:11.095
There probably doesn't need multiple editions of the... Not if it's modern and there's a good

55:11.395 --> 55:13.937
approved text within the author's lifetime.

55:14.017 --> 55:16.099
There's probably a couple of typos that need these extra notes.

55:16.179 --> 55:16.620
Sure.

55:16.680 --> 55:18.401
That sounds like Keats, for instance.

55:18.422 --> 55:34.757
But when you get back that far, even as far as Keats, poems came out in two different versions, a journal version and then a book version, so that La Belle, there are two complete versions of La Belle d'Amazon Messie, which differ a great deal from journal to book.

55:34.777 --> 55:40.542
And then there are ones he left to his death, and it's not as big a mess as, say, Dickinson.

55:40.927 --> 55:43.569
which is another huge, nice mess for people to work with.

55:44.751 --> 55:48.914
That almost demands to be read in facsimile, wouldn't you think, if we can leave it that way?

55:48.934 --> 55:49.675
Well, you can.

55:49.695 --> 55:52.798
That was for a form of publication, I think Franklin has argued.

55:53.018 --> 56:07.812
But even reading in facsimile, since sometimes she leaves the space and she puts as many as fourteen different possibilities for the space at the bottom of the page, there's no way to arrive at the final poem, because she doesn't say which one she would have chosen.

56:08.078 --> 56:13.724
So you have 14 versions of the poem there, depending on which noun you slot into that space.

56:13.744 --> 56:16.727
So that's where the editor really would have intervened, don't you think?

56:16.747 --> 56:17.308
Well, yes.

56:17.328 --> 56:19.130
Had it been published, she would have had to choose.

56:19.330 --> 56:21.752
But she left a lot of those thoughts at the bottom of the page.

56:22.053 --> 56:24.295
She'd make little asterisks and put several possibilities.

56:24.375 --> 56:26.437
So does that help you as a reader, or does that confuse you?

56:26.918 --> 56:28.660
Well, it helps you to understand her mind.

56:29.120 --> 56:35.807
Because as you put in, this poem I'm thinking about is the one called The Bible is an Antique Volume.

56:36.023 --> 56:41.129
written by fated men at the suggestion of holy specters.

56:41.449 --> 56:43.992
You can see why they love her today.

56:44.012 --> 56:44.352
That's wonderful.

56:44.372 --> 56:53.422
And so when she comes to the end, she wants to say that if they'd stop all this hellfire and damnation stuff in the pulpit, people would want to be religious, but they're scaring them away.

56:53.442 --> 57:00.950
And so she's thinking about Orpheus, and she says, had got the tale a blank, blank teller, all the boys would come.

57:01.731 --> 57:03.653
Orpheus' sermon, fascinated.

57:04.134 --> 57:05.355
It did not condemn.

57:05.875 --> 57:09.200
So have at the tail a, and she says, friendly teller?

57:09.701 --> 57:12.605
Have at the tail a tropic, a tropic teller?

57:12.885 --> 57:14.788
Have at the tail a typic teller?

57:14.808 --> 57:18.513
Have at the tail, I think the one she would have had was a warbling teller.

57:18.553 --> 57:19.735
That would say if it was beautiful.

57:21.237 --> 57:24.302
So with each one, she's thinking typic.

57:24.782 --> 57:28.808
If they told those wonderful stories about types and anti-types, then people would come.

57:29.489 --> 57:30.010
Tropic.

57:30.547 --> 57:33.992
One with metaphorical imagination, people would come, friendly.

57:34.392 --> 57:36.255
On a human level, people would come.

57:36.355 --> 57:37.777
And she gives you all these options?

57:37.797 --> 57:38.017
Yes.

57:38.037 --> 57:42.503
I think of, like, if you go over to Shakespeare's song, it was at 146, where they really messed up.

57:42.523 --> 57:42.803
Yes.

57:43.244 --> 57:46.688
And so there's that one word there.

57:46.708 --> 57:51.515
I love just reading the various suggestions.

57:51.615 --> 57:52.596
Yes, many.

57:53.017 --> 57:54.979
Slave, flaw.

57:55.220 --> 57:55.600
What is it?

57:55.620 --> 57:56.341
Who knows?

57:56.562 --> 57:56.942
I know.

57:57.108 --> 57:57.549
You do?

57:57.749 --> 58:00.733
In my Shakespeare book, which I think you said you had.

58:00.753 --> 58:02.254
I have, and it's a few years, yes.

58:02.274 --> 58:13.829
Well, I think that I know what he did, what he wanted to do, but I may not give him my reasons, but anyway, and I think I'm right, but that's really the end or the end.

58:13.909 --> 58:14.550
I have the book.

58:15.271 --> 58:16.813
Well, you can look it up.

58:16.873 --> 58:17.554
I will.

58:17.594 --> 58:19.476
It's Shakespeare, it's 146.

58:19.496 --> 58:20.197
146, yeah.

58:20.678 --> 58:22.660
Do you want the Dickinson?

58:23.163 --> 58:24.685
With all the words down the bottom?

58:25.085 --> 58:26.807
I have an edition of Dickinson.

58:26.827 --> 58:27.227
Okay.

58:27.387 --> 58:29.650
Do you have a Johnson edition?

58:29.690 --> 58:31.491
The three-volume Johnson?

58:31.512 --> 58:32.553
I do, yes, yes.

58:32.593 --> 58:32.953
Okay.

58:33.413 --> 58:35.516
If the Bible is an antique volume.

58:37.678 --> 58:38.959
Is this the one that Harvard published?

58:39.800 --> 58:40.060
Yes.

58:40.641 --> 58:40.821
Yeah.

58:41.061 --> 58:42.002
I have that.

58:42.022 --> 58:47.127
In the three-volume one, you'll see all the friendly, tippic, trophic, warbling all listed down at the bottom.

58:48.068 --> 58:51.692
I have it.

58:51.712 --> 58:51.852
Good.

58:51.872 --> 58:52.613
That's wonderful.

58:53.335 --> 58:57.462
So I've got your book on the sonnets, but just help me here.

58:57.482 --> 59:01.368
How did you arrive at knowing what that word, what Shakespeare is?

59:01.388 --> 59:11.865
Well, in many of the sonnets, Shakespeare uses the same root in all four of the parts, quatrain one, quatrain two, quatrain three, a couple of, but that's four parts.

59:12.426 --> 59:17.875
And he'll use, say, like fed, seeding, seed.

59:18.749 --> 59:21.732
But the same word will appear the four times.

59:21.772 --> 59:24.134
Nobody had noticed this until I did my book.

59:24.834 --> 59:29.699
And it's really fascinating because it ties together the four pieces.

59:30.399 --> 59:31.720
And that's because people don't look at the words.

59:31.740 --> 59:32.961
They only look at the sentiments.

59:32.981 --> 59:34.943
So they never notice the same words.

59:34.963 --> 59:40.008
And so I call those keywords because they seem to me to be deliberately there.

59:40.048 --> 59:43.471
It doesn't occur in each part separately unless somebody's putting it there.

59:44.492 --> 59:47.254
Then there are certain interesting ones where you see it.

59:47.808 --> 59:49.670
In part one, you see it in part two.

59:50.190 --> 59:51.211
You see it in a couplet.

59:51.231 --> 59:53.113
And you expect it in part three, and it's not there.

59:53.574 --> 59:55.115
But then I was trying to figure out why.

59:55.596 --> 59:57.237
Usually it's the negative of the rest.

59:57.578 --> 01:00:01.121
So when he's not talking about it, he won't put it in the other three.

01:00:01.401 --> 01:00:05.546
So it's a sonnet that has two points of view of them.

01:00:05.566 --> 01:00:13.113
And these words are, of course, crucial, because they appear in each one of the four parts.

01:00:13.814 --> 01:00:17.157
And sometimes he does very funny things when he can't

01:00:17.474 --> 01:00:18.896
Not Marble, not a Gilded Mother.
