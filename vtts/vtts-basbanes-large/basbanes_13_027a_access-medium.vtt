WEBVTT

00:02.427 --> 00:04.349
What do you want to do here?

00:04.369 --> 00:06.732
Well, I'm going to use... I'm interviewing you.

00:07.113 --> 00:08.014
I'll explain to you.

00:09.356 --> 00:10.437
I'm writing a book.

00:11.158 --> 00:16.224
I'm finishing a book right now that will be published next year by HarperCollins.

00:17.346 --> 00:19.048
It's a publisher here in New York City.

00:20.089 --> 00:21.111
Who is the publisher?

00:21.171 --> 00:22.592
HarperCollins.

00:23.213 --> 00:24.435
It used to be Harper and Roe.

00:24.455 --> 00:25.276
It's a good publisher.

00:26.377 --> 00:30.983
And it's a companion volume to my first book,

00:31.385 --> 00:33.648
This book is about libraries.

00:33.668 --> 00:35.691
I'm going to send you a copy.

00:36.031 --> 00:38.354
Yes, I promise.

00:38.374 --> 00:38.855
I'll send it.

00:39.496 --> 00:40.397
I'll be home tomorrow.

00:40.437 --> 00:41.398
I'll send it Thursday.

00:43.160 --> 00:53.494
I'm writing now about libraries and books as a means to preserve culture, as a means to preserve a heritage.

00:53.997 --> 00:56.200
libraries through history, libraries.

00:56.441 --> 00:57.582
Of course I'm very interested.

00:58.504 --> 01:01.328
You are writing the book as what you said?

01:01.348 --> 01:01.448
Yes.

01:01.709 --> 01:02.169
As what?

01:02.750 --> 01:13.266
A book about libraries, about books, about people, about librarians, about books and libraries as instruments to preserve culture.

01:13.286 --> 01:14.729
I see.

01:14.749 --> 01:18.334
So I'm very interested in your experiences.

01:18.618 --> 01:20.660
in Vilna and also here.

01:21.441 --> 01:22.902
Did you see my little speech?

01:22.923 --> 01:23.643
I have it.

01:23.663 --> 01:24.384
Yes, I love it.

01:24.484 --> 01:24.885
I have it.

01:25.525 --> 01:25.986
I've read it.

01:26.586 --> 01:27.327
It's very nice.

01:28.288 --> 01:28.869
I'm interested.

01:28.929 --> 01:31.772
You were a librarian in the 1930s.

01:31.812 --> 01:32.533
In what?

01:32.873 --> 01:36.777
You were a librarian in Vilna.

01:36.797 --> 01:36.897
Yes.

01:37.478 --> 01:42.623
Can you tell me a little bit about what drew you to... To librarianship?

01:42.663 --> 01:43.344
Yes, yes.

01:45.246 --> 01:47.308
I grew up

01:47.913 --> 01:59.785
A little bit of my biography is in the Evo Annual, Volume 22, I think, or 21.

02:00.165 --> 02:05.030
I wrote an article called, The World of My Parents.

02:06.431 --> 02:17.582
Now, my parents were teachers, both of them educated teachers, who at that time, it was the turn of the century,

02:18.068 --> 02:22.115
received a higher education in Russia.

02:22.135 --> 02:42.287
That was rather, so my parents belonged to the class which in Russia is prominently distinguished as the intelligentsia, not bourgeoisie, maybe the

02:43.195 --> 03:11.667
the little bourgeoisie but it was a separate class of people with higher education who rose from their so to say rather rose from their milieu it means their on the side of my father

03:12.541 --> 03:18.288
My family was in agriculture, they were farmers, Jewish farmers.

03:18.308 --> 03:26.297
But one of my grandfathers, the farmer, was a muskyl.

03:26.317 --> 03:27.899
You know what a muskyl means?

03:30.121 --> 03:34.026
A muskyl, it's a very important thing for you to know.

03:34.046 --> 03:38.631
Muskyl means about enlightenment, Jewish enlightenment.

03:38.651 --> 03:39.412
Very nice.

03:40.473 --> 03:41.434
I like it.

03:41.819 --> 04:07.843
you see so there were in Eastern Europe even people of you know not already starting to be educated by themselves if they were if they heard something about Mendelssohn about the Enlightenment period in Germany and then when

04:08.363 --> 04:22.081
This Enlightenment period influenced the development of this group of partisans of Enlightenment in Vilna and Vilna surrounding.

04:22.101 --> 04:28.329
So Vilna became the centre of his European Enlightenment.

04:30.412 --> 04:35.198
Vilna is called Jerusalem of Lithuania.

04:35.735 --> 04:39.118
And you could probably read about it a little bit.

04:39.138 --> 04:40.399
I don't want to waste your time.

04:40.459 --> 04:42.221
I have actually, yes.

04:42.241 --> 04:43.682
I don't want to waste your time.

04:44.163 --> 05:03.801
But my mother was the daughter of a rabbi who was already an enlightened rabbi, an employer of the rabbimate in Vilna, so that the rabbimate could be an intermediary between

05:05.789 --> 05:06.610
So much.

05:07.912 --> 05:11.075
And I feel that it's not to the point, maybe.

05:11.155 --> 05:12.337
Everything is good, yes.

05:13.078 --> 05:22.349
So, you see, there was a rabbinical institute, a rabbinical school in Russia, two of them.

05:22.369 --> 05:24.531
One was in Zhutomir, one was in Mila.

05:25.192 --> 05:29.417
So this rabbinical school was supposed to prepare

05:30.916 --> 05:38.183
government rabbis, so they could be intermediary between the government and the Jewish population.

05:39.824 --> 05:49.233
But the rabbinical school became a source of enlightenment.

05:49.253 --> 05:59.303
You see all the students in the rabbinical school, which was taught in Russian, became in a way radical.

06:00.295 --> 06:10.630
And they were trying to follow the German example of enlightened Jews.

06:11.772 --> 06:16.920
So this was my well-known on the mother's side.

06:17.841 --> 06:28.497
It means the mother was already a daughter of a rabbi who went to an academic institution and had already education.

06:28.814 --> 06:35.761
The education was in Russian, so our home was Russian-speaking.

06:38.924 --> 06:47.933
My father graduated from the teachers' institute also in Vilna.

06:47.953 --> 06:54.720
There was also a very major teaching institution for teachers

06:54.937 --> 06:56.639
Jewish elementary schools.

06:57.060 --> 07:09.216
So for you it's enough to know that both parents had higher education and a very good command besides Swedish or Russian.

07:10.037 --> 07:19.871
So at our home that was a private library and a good library.

07:20.912 --> 07:23.796
We had all the classics of

07:24.164 --> 07:25.366
Russian literature.

07:26.287 --> 07:52.720
So it's interesting, you know, how this Russian culture and education penetrated the, I would say, the classes of , and how this was transmitted to the children because of their private

07:53.122 --> 08:05.300
interests and care to provide libraries for their homes.

08:05.420 --> 08:11.208
Every home of an intelligent person had a library.

08:11.929 --> 08:17.437
So that was the beginning of our familiarity with literature.

08:18.779 --> 08:21.964
Then we were sent to Yiddish schools.

08:23.007 --> 08:30.057
because my adolescent years were already in interwar Poland.

08:30.558 --> 08:35.645
Interwar Poland means 1919 to 1939.

08:37.668 --> 08:52.288
And this was the period when the culture of Yiddish began to flourish and be the prevalent culture.

08:52.808 --> 08:58.113
for the intelligentsia in Yiddish in Vilna.

08:59.114 --> 09:09.103
So through the school where the language of instruction was Yiddish, we started to read Yiddish literature.

09:11.405 --> 09:22.596
And we had the luck of having two outstanding personalities in the Yiddish literary field.

09:23.183 --> 09:23.944
two teachers.

09:24.825 --> 09:34.217
One of them was Moshe Kulbak, which is one of the most prominent poets in Yiddish.

09:35.418 --> 09:37.601
He was a teacher of Yiddish literature.

09:38.142 --> 09:50.177
The other was Max Eric, who was from Western Poland, and he was very good in Polish literature.

09:50.758 --> 09:51.739
So we had

09:53.238 --> 09:59.163
very talented teachers, both of Yiddish and Polish literature.

09:59.744 --> 10:05.028
So that's how we were introduced to the books of others.

10:06.069 --> 10:11.313
And I remember the saying of Moshe Kulberg.

10:12.835 --> 10:22.603
She says, he says, I see that every

10:24.338 --> 10:39.454
member of the Jewish Intelligencia, should know by heart the works of Hugh Llanet Parrot, or at least know what has been published and some of the stories.

10:40.275 --> 10:53.890
And I remember that his teaching consisted in letting the children tell in their own words the stories of parrots, and I remember

10:54.359 --> 11:03.728
one unforgettable episode, when he let me speak about Peretz's story, The Three Gifts.

11:03.969 --> 11:22.527
It's a very famous story in this collection of... I will show you the volume in which this story is included.

11:22.945 --> 11:30.474
You see, I already am ninety years old, so I'll forget a little bit.

11:30.494 --> 11:32.016
You come to work every day here?

11:32.417 --> 11:38.725
I come to, I try, but it's, you know... You've never thought of retiring?

11:38.765 --> 11:45.112
I could not retire, because that's my life.

11:45.793 --> 11:52.902
I mean, I come home, so I also start reading, or now

11:53.236 --> 12:02.571
Unfortunately, their newspapers and periodicals occupy so much time.

12:02.591 --> 12:09.201
Things which you have to produce, you know, that I cannot read fiction.

12:09.221 --> 12:11.745
But that was my love, fiction.

12:12.246 --> 12:14.269
Fiction was, yes.

12:14.469 --> 12:17.454
As a librarian, too?

12:17.534 --> 12:21.420
As a librarian, too, as much as time is allowed.

12:21.957 --> 12:29.446
But, of course, one has to adjust our reading to the needs of the public.

12:30.367 --> 12:48.808
I started to work in the library of the Central Jewish Education Committee, which was the Central Yiddish Education Committee, which carried mostly Yiddish books, and children at that time still read Yiddish books.

12:50.425 --> 13:01.056
And what is interesting, that they liked very much non-Yiddish authors translated into Yiddish, like Mark Twain.

13:01.076 --> 13:02.998
No kidding.

13:03.018 --> 13:04.340
Yeah, that's surprising.

13:04.640 --> 13:06.482
Mark Twain and Jules Verne.

13:06.842 --> 13:07.423
Jules Verne.

13:07.443 --> 13:08.424
And this is in Vilna?

13:08.744 --> 13:09.125
Indeed.

13:10.186 --> 13:18.154
And the books of Jules Verne was published in America, also for popular reading.

13:18.505 --> 13:24.413
And they were our copies in the library, were so worn out as I explained it.

13:24.793 --> 13:38.491
I described my work a little bit in a book, in a Yiddish book, and then I have a translation of these recollections of my work.

13:39.633 --> 13:47.263
So why did, you know, like one professor at civil university,

13:48.340 --> 13:51.644
wrote about children's literature in Swedish.

13:52.565 --> 14:01.234
So it's accepted that Sholem Aleichem has two volumes of stories for Jewish children.

14:01.655 --> 14:07.160
So everybody accepts that he was a writer for children.

14:07.901 --> 14:13.287
But his stories were little for adults, more than for children.

14:13.307 --> 14:14.989
He's famous.

14:15.982 --> 14:20.007
one of the classics, which is not, which did not die.

14:20.047 --> 14:21.328
He's known in the West.

14:21.368 --> 14:23.290
He's known, even in Russia.

14:24.331 --> 14:25.913
There are many translations.

14:25.933 --> 14:28.236
His name was Rabinowitz, I think.

14:28.256 --> 14:29.117
Rabinowitz.

14:30.959 --> 14:33.041
And there is another one, Abramovich.

14:33.422 --> 14:45.195
So, you see, so the children like adventure stories and happy stories, and that's what they found in Mark Twain or in

14:45.530 --> 14:55.641
But Jewish stories about Jewish children are not necessarily heavy stories, nor adventure stories.

14:55.661 --> 14:57.323
How many books here do you work with?

14:58.284 --> 15:01.108
How many books here do you work with, would you say?

15:01.508 --> 15:06.874
Now, imagine there is a lot of things about books.

15:07.495 --> 15:11.740
You correspond with writers of the book.

15:11.760 --> 15:14.743
Sometimes in the Yiddish field now,

15:16.462 --> 15:19.425
arise new writers, new names.

15:20.206 --> 15:22.368
They come from Russia.

15:22.388 --> 15:25.631
They try to recover their past.

15:25.651 --> 15:26.232
They come here?

15:26.712 --> 15:28.114
Yes.

15:28.134 --> 15:31.377
Some of them are in Israel, they write to us.

15:31.397 --> 15:39.085
Some of them are here, but in different cities, so we correspond.

15:39.105 --> 15:45.591
But there was a time when there is such a implication

15:47.157 --> 15:49.000
book annual.

15:49.020 --> 15:50.222
Have you seen that?

15:50.302 --> 15:50.482
No?

15:51.023 --> 15:51.864
I'll show you.

15:51.884 --> 15:52.665
I have it here.

15:53.707 --> 16:06.506
So when I started working here, the Ivo's task in the field of Jewish books was since Ivo emphasized Yiddish.

16:07.727 --> 16:16.320
So to collect information about the Yiddish book, he published a list of new Yiddish books

16:16.553 --> 16:19.256
in the annual edition of the annual.

16:19.877 --> 16:25.303
So I had to look through all the Yiddish books which appeared during the year.

16:25.764 --> 16:32.171
And there were about 200, 150 Yiddish books during the year.

16:32.672 --> 16:34.174
You have to look at them.

16:34.394 --> 16:41.222
You have to learn how to, so to say, describe a book in short.

16:41.242 --> 16:43.725
And of course you were,

16:44.397 --> 16:55.229
drawn in into the book and sometimes I remember I was sitting until eleven o'clock at night here and reading or compiling such a leaf.

16:55.249 --> 17:05.400
So at that time I had a very contact with books, Jewish contact with Yiddish books and responsibility.

17:05.841 --> 17:11.687
And then when I got older, another librarian, Zachary Baker, which is

17:12.308 --> 17:20.181
already a very known librarian, and I showed you, I can show you what he did also in Evo.

17:20.742 --> 17:24.829
So Evo's responsibility, first of all, is for Yiddish books.

17:25.210 --> 17:34.786
And Yiddish books, unfortunately, decreased in popular, in, I mean in readership.

17:34.806 --> 17:37.270
There is a place in Massachusetts

17:37.638 --> 17:40.542
I wrote about him in my first book.

17:41.303 --> 17:47.031
When I sent you the book, Aaron Lansky, National Yiddish Book Centre.

17:47.131 --> 17:49.194
Book Centre, you're right.

17:49.254 --> 17:57.025
So, the production of Yiddish books decreased considerably lately.

17:57.306 --> 18:01.031
It's less young authors.

18:01.852 --> 18:05.417
It's mostly a generation from before the war.

18:06.072 --> 18:11.179
who writes in Yiddish as a mother tongue.

18:11.199 --> 18:12.180
How important is it?

18:12.981 --> 18:15.124
You must know the collection so very well.

18:15.284 --> 18:22.734
I imagine your greatest service today is explaining the collection to people who come in.

18:23.816 --> 18:25.318
Would you say that's it?

18:25.498 --> 18:33.369
Not exactly, but of course I have an idea of what collections we have.

18:33.909 --> 18:35.151
This library

18:37.915 --> 19:05.998
This library is an inheritor of another Yiddish library which was founded in the late 30s by Mendel Elkin, who was an amateur who has a lot of connection with the Yiddish literary world.

19:06.215 --> 19:11.602
established a library for Yiddish readers in America.

19:11.622 --> 19:12.643
He established it here?

19:12.783 --> 19:13.043
Here.

19:14.385 --> 19:32.087
But he also took care of connecting his library to the Vilna library and in a way fed books to Vilna and the

19:32.607 --> 19:40.494
On the other hand, also received books from Poland, books which were published in Poland and received here.

19:40.875 --> 19:45.599
So he was the nucleus of our library.

19:45.999 --> 19:57.770
When the Evo found out what is going on in Eastern Europe, they transferred.

19:57.790 --> 20:00.232
You mean what was going on with the Germans?

20:00.453 --> 20:02.074
With the Germans and the Russians.

20:02.797 --> 20:32.517
so the Russians did not allow the Evo library to serve the public because it contained not only communist books so it was a terrific censorship even during short Russian rule so it means in 1940 the Evo library was transferred here the history of the Evo library I wrote

20:32.986 --> 20:39.875
And then it was improved by Zachary Bacon and Bella Weinberg too young.

20:39.895 --> 20:41.357
I've read it, yes.

20:41.377 --> 20:42.619
I've seen it.

20:43.179 --> 20:45.462
So it has many collections.

20:46.404 --> 21:01.103
It has the books which was found here in America by private collectors and they were collected by Mendel Adkin.

21:01.859 --> 21:08.186
Then after the war started to come, the books looted by the German from Germany.

21:09.428 --> 21:12.491
It is amazing to me that those books survived.

21:13.352 --> 21:14.393
Yes, you see.

21:14.413 --> 21:18.578
The story of how those books survived is amazing to me.

21:18.598 --> 21:20.500
Yes, so how did they survive?

21:23.423 --> 21:29.470
The German appointed, it's also a whole story, appointed

21:31.357 --> 21:32.679
Jewish experts.

21:32.940 --> 21:35.964
I mentioned that.

21:35.984 --> 21:37.827
Yes, I've read this.

21:39.190 --> 21:44.879
So some of the Jewish books were considered rare and they saved them.

21:45.259 --> 21:54.394
But besides that, in the beginning they did not discriminate very much and they shipped home

21:54.982 --> 22:01.848
the Jewish libraries, the Fraschul library, very famous in Wiener, they shipped to Germany.

22:02.489 --> 22:07.453
And we started to receive these books from Germany.

22:08.194 --> 22:14.699
So it means the books looted by Germans and shipped to Germany.

22:15.360 --> 22:21.025
Some of them were sent directly to us because they had the Wiener stamps.

22:21.445 --> 22:24.448
And some of them were

22:24.918 --> 22:34.170
returned to us by the organization called Jewish Cultural Reconstruction, headed by Salo Barone and Hannah Ironman.

22:35.452 --> 22:44.665
So, this library has books from Vilna, which belong to the Yibo and which belong to the Sresho Library.

22:45.486 --> 22:50.993
And within the Sresho Library there are not only Yiddish books, but also Hebrew books.

22:51.344 --> 22:55.388
a great deal of religious quarry.

22:55.448 --> 22:59.973
Tell me, if you could, in your words, how important it was to save these books during the war.

23:01.035 --> 23:02.696
Why it was so important?

23:04.979 --> 23:17.132
It was important, first of all, by the fact itself that they went through the Nazi war machine and well

23:17.467 --> 23:21.813
but considered survivors of a civilization, you could say.

23:27.061 --> 23:45.347
Then it was important to revive a center which would emphasize the cultural treasures, the book treasures of a major

23:46.323 --> 23:48.267
cultural center in Europe.

23:48.988 --> 24:02.735
So this would, so to say, to save the books which was in the center of Jewish culture.

24:03.075 --> 24:07.183
You understand what it means?

24:09.340 --> 24:13.145
People risk their lives, people risk their lives to save books.

24:13.305 --> 24:14.246
To save books.

24:15.027 --> 24:24.840
So, this was the Sutsky-Varka-Cherginsky team, which is described, I think, by Dr. Fishman.

24:24.860 --> 24:26.322
Yes, I have that.

24:26.342 --> 24:31.488
And who, Sutsky-Varka-Cherginsky book about Mira, which is described.

24:33.070 --> 24:37.776
And there is a Sutsky-Varka-Cherginsky collection here.

24:37.956 --> 24:39.178
Really?

24:39.715 --> 24:57.518
So these books were then found in the underground, you know, hiding places and then recovered.

24:57.958 --> 25:04.146
And then the problem was how to bring them from here.

25:04.166 --> 25:08.592
So some of them, in this little book,

25:10.343 --> 25:26.549
Ashes, what is it first, Saved from Fire or something, I have this book here by David Fishman, he will tell you it's more difficult, he brought this book from Vilna to here.

25:27.491 --> 25:34.562
So the direct shipment of books after the war was a very risky situation.

25:34.863 --> 25:36.365
Even after the war?

25:36.545 --> 25:38.186
Yeah, even after the war.

25:38.206 --> 25:45.814
Because the Lithuanians, the Soviets, and then the Lithuanians did not want to send it abroad.

25:46.695 --> 25:55.364
The Lithuanian government, for instance, even if the books did not belong to the National Library.

25:56.004 --> 26:01.630
When you came to this country, and I understand you escaped from a train, is that right?

26:02.318 --> 26:05.743
Did you know that you would work as a librarian when you came here?

26:05.823 --> 26:12.452
No, I didn't know that I worked as a librarian, but I worked in Smith College.

26:12.512 --> 26:14.575
The first job was at Smith College.

26:14.595 --> 26:20.142
It's because my Polish professor, I studied at the Polish University.

26:20.463 --> 26:23.106
Polish professor was teaching at Smith College.

26:23.887 --> 26:24.889
He met my father.

26:25.390 --> 26:30.857
He found out that I escaped, and he provided me with a job.

26:31.360 --> 26:37.446
in the library in the Russian and Polish acquisitions.

26:38.007 --> 26:39.949
So I helped in this area.

26:40.369 --> 26:43.632
I did not have a formal education.

26:44.313 --> 27:01.030
And then father was in New York and he knew the management of Ivo and Ivo already inherited this wonderful library and needed somebody

27:01.550 --> 27:18.956
who would know Yiddish and Polish and Russian, so they invited me eventually to be an assistant librarian, and then I was even the head librarian for a certain period of time.

27:20.799 --> 27:23.623
Was that a very rewarding period for you?

27:23.683 --> 27:24.705
Yes, it was.

27:25.107 --> 27:41.766
because the library was constantly enriched, you know, by these books which was rescued from Germany and because it was in the center of Yiddish cultural life in New York.

27:42.807 --> 27:54.760
So there was a contact between the librarian and the literary world of New York, Yiddish literary world of New York.

27:56.039 --> 28:19.448
And then there was this possibility of making lists of books or even short summaries of Yudish literature and for the Britannica Yearbook, which was an achievement of interest to Yudish literary world.

28:19.698 --> 28:20.959
all were included.

28:22.220 --> 28:25.803
I think the Encyclopedia Britannica had a year ago.

28:25.823 --> 28:28.866
What's the most satisfying aspect of your job?

28:28.886 --> 28:33.049
What do you find most satisfying in this work?

28:33.069 --> 28:45.920
Well, it was these literary records, skipping literary records of Jewish books, and then the contact with people looking for information.

28:47.141 --> 28:49.063
Now, the contact

28:49.921 --> 29:00.553
was because Dr. Wilder himself taught Yiddish.

29:00.573 --> 29:05.959
He was the first to introduce Yiddish in academia.

29:05.979 --> 29:15.810
So he brought sometimes groups of his students to the library explaining to them that Yiddish was a language

29:16.195 --> 29:20.801
was aware of world literature which had some translations.

29:21.201 --> 29:26.789
So sometimes I had to prepare exhibitions of these books for his students.

29:28.511 --> 29:34.479
Then it was the scholarly board.

29:35.260 --> 29:45.493
Sometimes scholars would come to find out about the Holocaust, which was for scholars of the Holocaust.

29:45.912 --> 29:47.594
What can you find here?

29:47.675 --> 29:51.540
If you are a scholar of the Holocaust, what can you find here in the collections?

29:51.560 --> 29:53.182
What kinds of things can you find?

29:55.325 --> 30:14.653
There was a project in the beginning, in the 1950s, together with Yad Voshem, we tried to list all the books in the Yiddish language and then in the Hebrew language.

30:14.920 --> 30:21.947
So whatever has been written on the whole of us, we try to get and register it.

30:22.988 --> 30:25.851
And even articles also.

30:25.871 --> 30:37.824
So these participants in the project used the newspapers and books.

30:37.844 --> 30:44.691
So we had a contact with the DP in Germany.

30:45.312 --> 30:49.958
and they sent us all which they produced.

30:49.978 --> 31:04.477
So it was kind of a contact with the survivors' war and their desire to express, to tell what happened.

31:04.678 --> 31:14.070
So it was a need for that centre which would bring Eastern Europe to here.

31:16.598 --> 31:34.646
I would say Evo as a center for East European study, Swedish, Hebrew, and in the native language, in the Polish, and many, many Holocaust survivors.

31:34.726 --> 31:37.991
If there wasn't a Evo, what would happen to this material?

31:38.331 --> 31:42.838
Would that constitute a loss of your culture?

31:44.080 --> 31:45.222
I'm sure about that.

31:46.163 --> 31:58.622
we introduced not only a source for Yiddish and East European material, including Grafshin material.

31:58.983 --> 32:05.954
The Soviet literature is very well represented, the Soviet Jewish literature.

32:07.656 --> 32:14.567
So this was a centre for East European material.

32:16.724 --> 32:39.553
And in general, our publications still, you know, had many representatives of scholarship in Eastern Europe, like Cherikovar, Leszczynski, who else?

32:40.834 --> 32:43.778
Some other...

32:45.175 --> 32:51.522
Trug was one who wrote a book about human wrath.

32:51.542 --> 33:03.156
There was a story in the New York Times a couple of years ago about some materials they found in Vilna in an old Catholic church that they wanted to bring here.

33:03.736 --> 33:04.838
It's still over there.

33:04.898 --> 33:06.159
They haven't got them here yet.

33:06.760 --> 33:07.821
They wanted to bring them here.

33:08.241 --> 33:10.464
The Lithuanias would not let out.

33:10.844 --> 33:11.385
It's terrible.

33:12.968 --> 33:14.470
And what happens to that material?

33:14.570 --> 33:20.860
Is it, is it... I cannot tell you exactly what is now happening.

33:20.880 --> 33:30.074
There was a delegation in the... Zachary Baker, in this introduction, from the speech, he tells... Yeah, I'll call him.

33:30.094 --> 33:31.396
He's out in California now.

33:31.416 --> 33:35.082
Yeah, yeah.

33:35.102 --> 33:37.545
Or you could speak to Pearl Berger.

33:38.286 --> 33:38.847
Berger.

33:39.528 --> 33:41.271
She was a member of the

33:41.521 --> 33:53.794
of this delegation, so they would know better about what is the fate of these books which belong to Evo.

33:54.515 --> 33:57.939
Now, you were 90 years old in May, I guess.

33:58.279 --> 33:59.600
You had your 90th birthday.

33:59.740 --> 34:01.322
Did you come to work on your birthday?

34:05.827 --> 34:07.349
Did I come to work?

34:07.609 --> 34:08.710
No, I don't.

34:10.276 --> 34:16.865
What telephone is that?

34:18.367 --> 34:23.794
You see that you are working for inspirational material.

34:24.074 --> 34:27.879
And my material is so bright, what can I tell you?

34:27.899 --> 34:29.301
No, you're doing very well.

34:29.381 --> 34:30.322
I'm really interested.

34:30.543 --> 34:35.389
You've been involved with this organization for 60 years.

34:35.572 --> 34:36.553
That's a long time.

34:36.754 --> 34:37.014
Yeah.

34:37.655 --> 34:39.397
So what can I tell you?

34:39.577 --> 34:41.600
Well, just the satisfaction, I guess.

34:41.940 --> 34:46.426
You devoted an entire life to books and to libraries.

34:46.446 --> 34:46.887
Yes, of course.

34:47.107 --> 34:50.031
I liked very much the work I did.

34:50.051 --> 35:04.870
So as I told you, because it was an intellectual activity, it was a contact with the literary, with survivors who had some

35:05.693 --> 35:22.809
intellectual interest and wanted to leave a record of their experiences and the contact with the personnel of Ivo, especially Dr. Weinreich.

35:22.829 --> 35:31.718
Of course, Dr. Weinreich was not available every day in my work, but I knew that

35:31.985 --> 35:39.112
he's there, that he's interested in what is going on, that the library is important for him.

35:40.134 --> 35:44.378
And he was a personality.

35:47.581 --> 35:58.633
He represented a certain ideology and it was, it was

35:59.137 --> 36:28.502
rewarding to work for somebody who would appreciate, who would, so to say, be the leading spirit of the organization, and he would have a goal of developing Jewish science in a country which was new.

36:29.005 --> 36:33.290
to this type of science which he represented.

36:33.690 --> 36:37.414
So it was some kind of a pioneering activity.

36:37.875 --> 36:47.846
And I think that the American Jewish community appreciated that.

36:47.866 --> 36:56.616
And it is very inspiring that this American Jewish intelligentsia, maybe not

36:56.984 --> 37:22.840
not necessarily the masses who were very working people who just read the Yiddish paper, but there was an American, young American audience, educated, who started to show understanding and interest for the heritage of Eastern Europe.

37:24.052 --> 37:28.296
These people who saved the books are great heroes, of course, aren't they?

37:28.857 --> 37:30.619
Who saved the books.

37:31.119 --> 37:34.543
Who actually saved them during the war.

37:34.603 --> 37:37.967
There were many survivors who saved the books.

37:39.348 --> 37:40.970
They probably understood that too.

37:41.010 --> 37:46.636
Do you think they understood that maybe they wouldn't survive but the books might?

37:47.136 --> 37:47.657
Yes, of course.

37:47.677 --> 37:48.818
Do you think they understood that?

37:49.018 --> 37:49.579
Yes, of course.

37:51.101 --> 37:53.383
It was an organised activity.

37:53.768 --> 38:09.288
in the Jewish ghetto and people used the library for their own need and also followed the instructions of the Jugendrat to save books and bring them to the center.

38:09.909 --> 38:18.661
So the population of the ghetto was aware of books and considered it a treasure.

38:19.341 --> 38:22.105
And the importance of... I read where in Prague

38:22.372 --> 38:23.814
there was going to be a museum.

38:24.094 --> 38:24.855
Are you familiar?

38:25.296 --> 38:29.782
The same way the Germans were going to save the books, they wanted the Jewish books?

38:30.563 --> 38:31.104
The Germans.

38:31.124 --> 38:31.905
The Germans did.

38:31.965 --> 38:35.450
And then in Prague they were going to have a museum of an extinct race.

38:35.911 --> 38:39.976
Are you familiar with that, that in Prague they were doing some kind of thing?

38:39.996 --> 38:51.332
Not in a great detail, but there is information that in Prague they want to organize.

38:51.886 --> 39:03.143
center to show the pernicious and extinguished already culture of European Jews.

39:03.864 --> 39:09.352
But to keep museum artifacts, but to keep artifacts, they would keep the artifacts.

39:09.372 --> 39:10.133
Oh yes, sure.

39:11.115 --> 39:12.697
I don't want to take up too much of your time.

39:12.777 --> 39:16.763
I did want to, I know you go home at four, so I want to

39:18.194 --> 39:26.605
I read a lot about you, so I have a lot of the background already, so we don't have to cover a lot of the background.

39:26.745 --> 39:39.082
I understand that, I mean, you probably want something interesting and I, so to say, tell you just generalities.

39:39.102 --> 39:44.749
It would be much better to give you an example.

39:44.829 --> 39:47.813
I'd love an example.

39:48.502 --> 40:01.378
Like, for instance, can you give me an example of how you help somebody who comes in and is looking for something, and the satisfaction that you have in finding something?

40:01.398 --> 40:04.822
So look, this is what I could remember.

40:06.264 --> 40:17.918
A man came from Israel with his family, and he remembers that as a child,

40:19.737 --> 40:26.086
A young adolescent, he left Warsaw with a stream of refuges.

40:26.446 --> 40:28.930
With a stream of refuges.

40:28.950 --> 40:31.473
He left Warsaw in 1939.

40:32.635 --> 40:45.152
But when he was in the pre-war years before, so he left Warsaw in a very dramatic period.

40:45.692 --> 40:48.276
The Germans suddenly attacked Warsaw.

40:48.779 --> 41:05.341
and the Jewish refugees like Krug and others start to leave Warsaw because the male population understood that they were the first to be exterminated.

41:05.361 --> 41:12.250
So he left in Warsaw and of course lost everything.

41:12.270 --> 41:16.255
He survived by wandering as a child through

41:17.028 --> 41:26.039
It wasn't easy for the children to reach Israel.

41:26.640 --> 41:44.082
It was a long road to Israel until they wandered through Russia and through Asiatic Russia until they got to Israel.

41:44.467 --> 41:50.274
In Israel, he was, of course, a child and got the Israeli education.

41:50.294 --> 41:59.466
Now, when he reached the middle age, he wants to go back to his memories of life in Warsaw.

42:00.367 --> 42:12.482
He remembers that he went to a Yiddish school, and he wants very much to know what textbooks they used in the Yiddish school, how to find them.

42:13.897 --> 42:16.120
And we did find it.

42:16.140 --> 42:27.878
And he recognized the textbook which he used in the Yiddish school with stories by the Yiddish writers like Sholem Aleichem and Abram Reitim.

42:28.799 --> 42:37.592
And the school years in the Yiddish Warsaw came back to him.

42:37.612 --> 42:42.199
And he was crying when he read and saw this book.

42:42.398 --> 42:46.602
Now, how did we find a textbook for me?

42:46.622 --> 43:10.768
It's because our catalogue was organised in the way that we had, you know, an alphabetical catalogue, and there were many Yiddish-language textbooks, but we had many authors, I mean, in the Yiddish catalogue.

43:11.170 --> 43:25.147
but we have already, already had a subject catalog, and we had a subject catalog for Yiddish catalog, and I found for him those which were published in Warsaw.

43:25.367 --> 43:39.844
So it was something which brought to him his childhood, which he abandoned in such a panic, and which disappeared completely, and this woman,

43:40.330 --> 43:47.900
of recollection of his school years were an unforgettable experience for him.

43:48.741 --> 43:49.602
That's a nice story.

43:49.683 --> 43:51.125
That's a lovely story.

43:52.066 --> 43:53.307
I love stories like that.

43:53.488 --> 43:53.848
You love.

43:54.209 --> 44:03.521
So I understand that a story like that would make it alive, what this library could mean.

44:03.541 --> 44:05.704
What it means to people, to an individual.

44:05.724 --> 44:08.548
Yes, what it means to people.

44:08.815 --> 44:13.241
what I would like maybe to recall a little more about that.

44:13.962 --> 44:27.221
But I, you know, in the life of a busy librarian, we don't have the time to make a note of such stories.

44:27.842 --> 44:34.312
But such a story leaves a trace in myself.

44:34.452 --> 44:38.738
For myself it was an experience which would be very familiar to me.

44:39.292 --> 44:41.235
And of course you help scholars all the time.

44:41.255 --> 44:43.257
We have all the time.

44:43.598 --> 44:50.567
Things going back to this period of Poland, to the pre-war period of Poland.

44:51.348 --> 44:57.656
I do remember the presence of such scholars as Dr. Jacob Schachty.

44:58.877 --> 45:00.619
This name is familiar.

45:01.441 --> 45:04.945
So that was some interesting

45:05.330 --> 45:10.034
Dr. Schatzke himself was a pyrrheophile.

45:10.054 --> 45:22.126
He had a tremendous collection of books and his special interest was Warsaw.

45:22.706 --> 45:32.075
The Evo published three volumes of his history of Jews in Warsaw.

45:32.095 --> 45:33.396
And he studied

45:33.983 --> 45:40.512
for these books he studied the Yiddish dailies, Heinz and Momeni.

45:40.532 --> 45:58.135
Since he was cut off from the archives and documents, at that time connection with Poland was difficult, it was in the 50s, he used the Yiddish dailies,

45:58.823 --> 46:00.885
which he found in Deep's library.

46:00.905 --> 46:02.207
So you have the dailies here too?

46:02.247 --> 46:03.268
You have newspapers here?

46:03.308 --> 46:03.488
Yes.

46:03.548 --> 46:05.090
Oh, that's wonderful.

46:05.110 --> 46:05.190
Yes.

46:05.210 --> 46:12.479
That's what is a very special trait of Deep's library.

46:14.441 --> 46:25.894
Yiddish daily newspapers, Yiddish and Polish, Yiddish language and Polish language, Jewish newspapers.

46:27.072 --> 46:28.473
Do you have them in microfilm?

46:28.854 --> 46:30.155
We have them in microfilm.

46:30.595 --> 46:36.320
We have them in the original, too, but mostly in the microfilm.

46:36.340 --> 46:55.678
So this contact with Dr. Shotsky, who studied the material for writing his books, was very interesting for the librarian because of his demands or his suggestions which he made to a librarian.

46:57.751 --> 46:58.532
That's wonderful.

46:59.774 --> 47:02.779
I'd like to take a couple, do you mind if I take a couple of photographs of you?

47:03.059 --> 47:04.001
Yeah, okay.

47:04.021 --> 47:05.743
Can I take a couple of pictures at your desk?

47:05.984 --> 47:10.631
At my desk, yes.

47:10.651 --> 47:11.772
You're telling me important things.

47:11.792 --> 47:15.879
I would stop.

47:16.880 --> 47:22.729
But you said your mother was a storyteller and your father was a journalist.

47:23.688 --> 47:28.615
My mother was a teacher, but she was a wonderful storyteller.

47:28.635 --> 47:30.157
And so you're the editor of this?

47:31.359 --> 47:31.960
You're the editor?

47:31.980 --> 47:34.844
I am the editor plus somebody else.

47:35.986 --> 47:39.271
Usually you look at the title page.

47:39.691 --> 47:44.498
I just want to get the date on it.

47:44.518 --> 47:45.320
This is brand new.

47:45.780 --> 47:47.383
This is out just now.

47:49.105 --> 47:52.530
I was happy to...

47:53.540 --> 47:56.463
Can I get a copy of this?

47:56.483 --> 47:59.045
Can I get a copy of this?

47:59.065 --> 47:59.525
A copy?

47:59.545 --> 48:00.106
I will make.

48:00.606 --> 48:05.330
All you make.

48:05.350 --> 48:05.911
Have done.

48:05.931 --> 48:08.833
Why don't you sit down at your desk and I'll take it.

48:09.294 --> 48:12.757
And make a nice face.

48:13.297 --> 48:14.919
Oh, you've got a beautiful face.

48:14.979 --> 48:23.226
You didn't have to work hard at that at all.

48:24.488 --> 48:30.116
Oh, that's nice.

48:30.697 --> 48:36.705
I'm going to get a couple of pictures.

48:37.266 --> 48:41.612
I want to get a couple of pictures, not just one.

48:44.977 --> 48:50.345
I feel that I have to reward you much more than I did.

48:50.365 --> 48:51.306
You're doing very well.

48:56.112 --> 49:06.245
Let me get another one.

49:06.265 --> 49:10.030
Now, you will leave me your name and address?

49:10.150 --> 49:11.652
Yes, my card is out in my bag.

49:11.672 --> 49:17.961
They made me leave my bag at the door, so my cards are out in my bag, but I'll get you my card.

49:19.543 --> 49:20.584
If you leave me that.

49:20.750 --> 49:29.419
I'm going to send you a copy of my book tomorrow, and I'll put my card in that.

49:29.479 --> 49:31.221
Thank you very much.

49:31.782 --> 49:35.766
And I'll do that as soon as I get back.

49:37.688 --> 49:47.078
I think our head librarian wants to talk to you also, to see you again, or to talk about your book.

49:54.635 --> 49:56.217
Excellent.

49:56.597 --> 50:02.484
This is a book collection which is not found.

50:02.504 --> 50:04.006
No, it's unique actually.

50:04.346 --> 50:06.249
What are you looking for?

50:06.749 --> 50:12.215
No, I was just looking for this here.

50:12.236 --> 50:16.601
This is a unique collection in your unique person.

50:18.222 --> 50:22.127
You know, the Vilna was really

50:22.377 --> 50:50.230
Jerusalem of Lithuania which means so many libraries were there, so many books were there, so much of Jewish culture was concentrated there despite of the difficulties of sometimes the hostile environment or sometimes it was simply indifferent, not supportive and sometimes it was even hostile.

50:50.250 --> 50:51.692
And it's so fortunate that it's

50:51.942 --> 50:55.066
A lot of it has been able to be transplanted here.

50:55.166 --> 50:56.247
That's right.

50:56.268 --> 51:02.375
So that's why this place is so unique, that he tries to preserve the artifacts.

51:03.116 --> 51:07.442
And you have been here for most of it, most of the time.

51:07.582 --> 51:08.523
I wouldn't say.

51:08.904 --> 51:13.950
The formative years were 1940s to 40s.

51:14.808 --> 51:17.532
But you've been here for 50 years now.

51:17.552 --> 51:19.735
But I have been here for a long time.

51:19.756 --> 51:34.999
But I must tell you that we are lucky that we got, as I say, the society or the community which was responsive to what we were trying to do.

51:35.520 --> 51:43.752
So despite of, you know, the strangeness or the, I mean,

51:44.727 --> 51:58.222
for some American Jews who did not know, even for the younger generation, the interest in Jewish roots and in the past of Ethiopian Jewry remains.

51:59.444 --> 52:02.327
And that sustains us.

52:02.347 --> 52:13.620
We have now young people who want both to learn Yiddish and to do something for our

52:14.377 --> 52:16.661
lost history.

52:16.681 --> 52:21.089
Okay, dear, I am trying to say something meaningful.

52:21.109 --> 52:23.393
You have only filled an hour worth of paper.

52:24.094 --> 52:24.956
It's quite wonderful.

52:27.761 --> 52:27.921
Okay.

52:27.941 --> 52:31.066
In Vilna now, it has the stamp of 1939.

52:31.086 --> 52:31.287
Yes.

52:31.307 --> 52:34.192
No, not 1939.

52:34.252 --> 52:36.576
But this has the stamp of, tell me again what that is.

52:36.596 --> 52:37.518
Now that's the stamp.

52:37.538 --> 52:39.321
You said that's the stamp.

52:40.533 --> 53:06.226
And this is, you see, this stamp shows that it belonged originally to the famous Strashun Library in Vilna.

53:06.887 --> 53:09.510
Then it was inherited.

53:11.043 --> 53:14.748
by the library of the Jewish community in Vilna.

53:14.768 --> 53:20.737
And then it was returned to us because it was a YIVA publication.

53:21.718 --> 53:22.279
So it was yours.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.543
It belonged to you.

53:25.683 --> 53:26.885
When do you think it came here?

53:26.925 --> 53:28.547
Do you think it came here before the war?

53:28.567 --> 53:33.294
I think it came here with... No, no, not before the war.

53:33.394 --> 53:33.835
Afterwards.

53:33.935 --> 53:34.756
After the war.

53:35.177 --> 53:37.280
After the books were found.

53:37.300 --> 53:39.042
So this is one of the books that was saved?

53:39.494 --> 53:41.116
Oh, that's great.

53:41.196 --> 53:41.797
That's wonderful.

53:42.018 --> 53:43.840
Yeah, that's really wonderful.

53:44.662 --> 53:47.045
And it's 1933.

53:47.065 --> 53:47.906
What is the title of it?

53:47.946 --> 53:48.427
Can you tell me?

53:48.447 --> 53:54.856
This is, yeah, Writings for Psychology and Pedagogy.

53:55.217 --> 53:56.238
And what was the last word?

53:56.599 --> 54:00.284
And this is... Writings for Psychology and what else?

54:00.445 --> 54:02.047
And Education.

54:02.688 --> 54:05.552
Oh, okay, sure, yeah.

54:06.072 --> 54:07.113
Wilna, 1933.

54:07.193 --> 54:08.754
That's Wilna there.

54:09.115 --> 54:10.796
That's right.

54:10.816 --> 54:11.717
Wilna, 1933.

54:11.737 --> 54:15.140
And this is the Jewish Yiddish and Wissenschaft institute.

54:17.262 --> 54:22.567
Department of psychology and pedagogy and education.

54:22.587 --> 54:26.411
They had... It was... No.

54:27.852 --> 54:32.556
Its original name was Jewish Scientific Institute.

54:33.857 --> 54:35.539
That was the original name.

54:36.042 --> 54:37.203
renamed later.

54:38.104 --> 54:39.286
Is this the original binding?

54:39.987 --> 54:40.467
Yes.

54:40.487 --> 54:43.391
And that's the original shelf mark, 53.3.J.

54:43.711 --> 54:43.911
Yes.

54:45.473 --> 54:48.677
So is that the shelf mark in the old library?

54:49.338 --> 54:54.124
It was the shelf mark of the Jewish community library.

54:54.144 --> 54:54.624
In Vilna?

54:54.644 --> 54:54.844
Yes.

54:56.567 --> 54:58.609
So we even know where it was in the library?

54:58.809 --> 54:59.890
Yes.

54:59.911 --> 55:00.611
Yes.

55:00.691 --> 55:01.192
We do know.

55:01.853 --> 55:04.296
Do you have the catalog from the old library?

55:04.336 --> 55:05.357
Was that preserved?

55:05.945 --> 55:14.153
Yes, we do have, not complete yet, but we do have a catalogue of the Vilna books.

55:14.553 --> 55:20.539
So even if all the books didn't survive, you still have a catalogue, you know what books there were.

55:20.559 --> 55:27.165
Oh yes, there was a catalogue of the Strachung Library, printed catalogue of the Strachung Library.

55:27.686 --> 55:33.471
There was no printed catalogue of the YIVO Library.

55:35.678 --> 55:48.371
Yes, but all the books which we got back from the Yibo library have a stamp, Yibo library, so it can, and it forms a special collection.

55:48.391 --> 55:49.091
Excellent, yes.

55:49.211 --> 55:50.533
Special collection here.

55:51.394 --> 55:54.617
Special collection of books rescued from Vilna.

55:55.017 --> 55:55.718
That we have.

55:56.819 --> 55:59.041
We don't have yet a complete catalog.

55:59.702 --> 56:04.687
We have a complete catalog of our Yiddish family.

56:04.707 --> 56:05.027
Yes.

56:05.513 --> 56:15.086
There are five values, and if you would have... Would you point to that book again?

56:19.352 --> 56:19.432
Yes.

56:19.452 --> 56:20.253
Thank you.

56:20.714 --> 56:22.696
So it's a little bit chaotic.

56:22.716 --> 56:27.683
Sir, when you describe this interview, could you send me a copy?

56:27.783 --> 56:28.144
Of course.

56:28.364 --> 56:32.570
And we will perhaps have to make a little bit of correction.

56:32.710 --> 56:33.411
Oh, absolutely.

56:36.108 --> 56:41.450
Here is your camera.

56:41.490 --> 56:45.105
That's excellent.
