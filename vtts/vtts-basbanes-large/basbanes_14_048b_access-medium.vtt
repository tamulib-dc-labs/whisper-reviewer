WEBVTT

00:02.292 --> 00:03.794
Does this start again?

00:03.894 --> 00:05.296
Yeah.

00:05.356 --> 00:06.298
Okay.

00:06.678 --> 00:13.107
If you look at science, technology, and medicine, which are the areas where we need... Let's start from the beginning.

00:13.167 --> 00:16.892
Somebody said to you about how things are online, aren't they?

00:17.193 --> 00:18.034
Yeah.

00:18.074 --> 00:22.039
The question that I got was that someone said, well, everything that's important is online.

00:22.059 --> 00:25.264
You can always sit down and read it off your computer screen from anywhere.

00:26.105 --> 00:28.608
And my point was that, no, it's not true.

00:29.529 --> 00:32.113
And I asked the group if there are

00:32.515 --> 00:37.102
how many of them actually read a newspaper every day, a regional, national paper.

00:37.623 --> 00:40.708
Every hand in the room went up, and then I said, how many of you read it online?

00:41.429 --> 00:46.256
The answer was two people out of the entire room, 100-plus Rotarians.

00:47.679 --> 00:59.417
And then I made the point to them that if you look in Science, Technology, and Medicine, STM, which is the fastest-moving, the fastest-growing in terms of the need for STMs, Science, Technology, and Medicine,

01:00.595 --> 01:03.979
You need to be able to get that information very quickly.

01:04.600 --> 01:06.282
It needs to be very current information.

01:06.843 --> 01:12.330
I asked them how much they thought of this was available online, 10%, 20%, 50%, 90%.

01:13.471 --> 01:15.213
Most of them thought it was about 50%.

01:15.594 --> 01:16.435
The answer is 1%.

01:16.495 --> 01:18.517
Come on.

01:18.537 --> 01:18.918
1%.

01:19.579 --> 01:20.620
This is verifiable?

01:21.021 --> 01:22.803
Is there literature on this?

01:23.243 --> 01:26.147
There will be because we're about to produce a report on this.

01:26.549 --> 01:28.592
The library is about to produce a report.

01:28.612 --> 01:30.274
Is there some way to make sure I get it?

01:30.314 --> 01:31.396
You'll get a copy.

01:31.416 --> 01:32.237
I guarantee it.

01:32.978 --> 01:34.440
It'll get in this new book.

01:35.582 --> 01:37.845
It's going to be in the Chronicle, too.

01:37.865 --> 01:39.268
We're going to get a big spread in Chronicle.

01:39.348 --> 01:51.966
But the whole point is that there are like 5,000 core journals that are in Index Medicus and Science Citation Index.

01:53.228 --> 02:00.178
And of those 5,000 core journals, what you get is about 1% available electronically.

02:00.198 --> 02:00.639
Wow.

02:00.659 --> 02:02.201
And that's it.

02:02.222 --> 02:04.805
But how about things that are really being like Stanford?

02:06.568 --> 02:09.773
They're actually putting stuff online in the first instance.

02:10.113 --> 02:10.614
Oh, yeah.

02:10.654 --> 02:11.656
They're not even publishing it.

02:12.176 --> 02:13.919
Oh, yeah.

02:14.179 --> 02:16.763
We publish our library bulletin in two forms.

02:17.064 --> 02:21.210
It's published by the Steinar Press, letterpress, beautiful, absolutely gorgeous,

02:21.528 --> 02:23.510
The same day it comes out, it comes out on the web.

02:25.032 --> 02:25.932
It does go on the web?

02:25.952 --> 02:27.254
Yeah.

02:27.274 --> 02:28.235
The entire contents.

02:28.255 --> 02:29.556
The entire contents.

02:29.656 --> 02:31.818
Front to back, all the illustrations, everything.

02:32.919 --> 02:35.082
And did you scan all the previous stuff?

02:35.162 --> 02:38.945
We're scanning all the previous stuff, including all the indices back to 1931.

02:39.126 --> 02:41.708
How do I get that if I want to find it?

02:41.828 --> 02:45.332
It's www.dartmouth.edu.

02:47.154 --> 02:51.518
That gets you to Dartmouth's homepage, and then you want to click on Libraries.

02:52.139 --> 02:54.862
And it's a subfield in the libraries.

02:54.882 --> 02:56.304
I didn't know about that.

02:56.324 --> 02:56.825
Now we know.

02:56.845 --> 02:58.407
Now, do you use computers?

02:59.268 --> 03:00.930
Mm-hmm.

03:00.950 --> 03:02.132
For research?

03:02.412 --> 03:03.934
Not a lot for research.

03:04.414 --> 03:04.655
No.

03:04.815 --> 03:11.203
I mean, that was how my sister told me about Biblio, and she gave me the web page.

03:11.223 --> 03:15.989
So I went into Biblio, and I downloaded a couple of articles, and I found out how to subscribe.

03:16.610 --> 03:16.830
Yeah.

03:17.182 --> 03:19.185
I hope it makes it better.

03:19.465 --> 03:22.530
The guy does have deep pockets, I was going to say.

03:22.550 --> 03:25.594
He does.

03:25.634 --> 03:27.697
But he's such a great man.

03:27.717 --> 03:29.199
I think it's nice.

03:29.279 --> 03:32.424
It starts with a little bit of innocence.

03:32.765 --> 03:36.870
I mean, they really aren't book professionals.

03:38.132 --> 03:41.417
But I like the innocence to a good place.

03:41.903 --> 03:46.389
The color is good.

03:46.470 --> 03:48.793
The design.

03:48.813 --> 03:49.594
I hope it works.

03:49.634 --> 03:51.076
I'm in every issue, by the way.

03:51.096 --> 03:53.600
I think I'm the only person who's been in every issue.

03:53.720 --> 03:55.262
I'm writing a regular poem.

03:56.544 --> 03:57.425
Well, that was great.

03:57.465 --> 04:00.790
See, a little work done up here.
