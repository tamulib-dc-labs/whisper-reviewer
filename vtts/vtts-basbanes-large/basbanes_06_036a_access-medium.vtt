WEBVTT

00:03.322 --> 00:04.583
talking to Colin Franklin.

00:05.364 --> 00:10.249
Do we have a name for this wonderful place, or do we just... Michael Fraun of Collins.

00:10.850 --> 00:11.610
Okay.

00:11.630 --> 00:12.511
Michael Fraun of Collins.

00:12.531 --> 00:13.132
It's wonderful.

00:13.492 --> 00:15.715
And I'll put this close, if that's okay with you.

00:16.235 --> 00:17.757
Yep.

00:19.298 --> 00:22.902
It's your book, Byron and Collins.

00:22.922 --> 00:23.763
Yeah.

00:23.783 --> 00:24.103
Go ahead.

00:24.524 --> 00:26.886
I'm sorry, continue.

00:26.906 --> 00:30.730
You're saying it's not that unusual for the person to do.

00:31.351 --> 00:33.314
to be a dealer as well as a collector.

00:34.155 --> 00:37.780
It's not at all unusual for a bookseller to have a private collection.

00:38.602 --> 00:43.629
It may be very irritating to the visitor, but it's not at all unusual.

00:45.652 --> 00:54.105
It's very, I think sometimes it's, by the way, I also ask you before, do you mind, if we make two questions, what I'd like to... How about auction, go ahead.

00:54.125 --> 01:01.155
If there's a good thing at auction, the only reason why, which allows you to get it is that you pay

01:01.372 --> 01:30.771
more for it than anybody else present things sensible i agree and i think so every my feeling is for every for every winner and option there's also another better but john mag said well that's not always well that's the last thing i wouldn't know but the the um no i believe you're right actually i have some reason to think that that is so but um

01:31.949 --> 01:48.193
Every success for a permanent object auction will have been thought silly by everybody else who didn't get it, not on grounds of jealousy, but because if they thought it sensible, they would have bought it.

01:48.213 --> 01:50.356
If they had the money to do, sir.

01:50.376 --> 01:52.039
Do you mind if I leave this on now?

01:52.319 --> 01:55.924
No, they might talk.

01:55.944 --> 01:57.687
You'll have to accept my words that

01:58.088 --> 02:01.331
if there's something that you don't want me to use, I won't.

02:01.471 --> 02:02.872
Yes, very good.

02:02.892 --> 02:08.777
Okay, and on my tape here, but we were talking about the garden.

02:09.358 --> 02:17.364
I obviously want to talk to you about a few other things as well, but I would be less than frank if I didn't tell you this is very good.

02:17.384 --> 02:17.945
Yes, I see, yes.

02:18.245 --> 02:19.926
All right, so let's talk about the garden.

02:19.946 --> 02:21.328
Let's.

02:22.088 --> 02:27.673
As I say, I've talked to a ton of people, fascinating stories about it.

02:29.290 --> 02:39.624
And I almost reached a point yesterday with another person who knew him very well, where I almost became very depressed.

02:39.664 --> 02:44.250
Because I've reached the point now where I think I know him pretty well.

02:44.651 --> 02:46.714
And it is depressing, you know.

02:46.914 --> 02:51.380
Because I don't, it's not my goal to blow this guy out of the water.

02:51.400 --> 02:56.327
It is my goal to tell the story of what happened, how the guy was doing to me.

02:57.455 --> 02:59.417
Let me ask you this directly.

03:01.038 --> 03:03.961
I know that you did a lot of business with Hayden.

03:03.981 --> 03:05.783
A certain amount.

03:05.963 --> 03:06.484
Not a lot.

03:06.504 --> 03:15.713
I mean, from time to time, the things we did were few added up as numbers of sales, transactions.

03:16.073 --> 03:18.295
Did you ever have any idea that he had a silent partner?

03:18.676 --> 03:18.916
No.

03:20.357 --> 03:26.263
This fascinated me about him philosophically because true and false, he was

03:26.885 --> 03:32.253
a philosopher, and it was important to him to project that.

03:35.337 --> 03:56.166
And I've no doubt that his greatest satisfaction would have been to be accepted as a man of deep wisdom, which I'm not judging this, I'm not offering this as any judgment,

03:56.467 --> 04:23.520
at all and just um except to say that's what i felt was his chief wish um i'm not i would not judging i mean i'm not saying whether i believe he was a great philosopher i'm not allowing that to enter the story at all i just that he um that that was a very important to him to be accepted as a profound thinker and i think collecting is a secondary activity for anybody uh and and

04:23.838 --> 04:31.770
Collecting is an inferior activity, and if you are a first-rate person, probably you don't need to collect.

04:31.830 --> 04:47.874
Collecting is a substitution for being, because by collecting you are identifying, you're creating something which isn't yours, but which is somebody else's, and you're bringing it upon yourself.

04:47.894 --> 04:50.318
But can a collection be a complex expression?

04:50.753 --> 04:58.181
It can be an expression of yourself because you're not the creator.

04:58.401 --> 05:03.667
You're merely borrowing other people and identifying with them because you're wealthy enough to do so.

05:03.687 --> 05:09.613
The point is you're the one who determines the focus, I think.

05:09.633 --> 05:13.658
You exercise your taste, which is a good secondary activity, like decorating a room.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.482
But it's not the primary activity, which is writing.

05:17.522 --> 05:20.305
That is why, by the way,

05:20.420 --> 05:27.917
I am doing a considerable chapter on creative people.

05:28.158 --> 05:28.298
Yes.

05:29.300 --> 05:30.343
Yes, yes.

05:30.423 --> 05:31.585
A very good example.

05:31.605 --> 05:32.487
A very good example.

05:32.507 --> 05:33.971
Harry McMurtry is another.

05:34.773 --> 05:35.454
He's a dealer.

05:35.875 --> 05:36.376
I know, yes.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.040
But he's an interesting man.

05:38.189 --> 05:39.911
Yes, I know nothing of his collecting.

05:40.611 --> 05:42.313
He's got four bookstores, right?

05:42.333 --> 05:46.797
I know, but that doesn't... I mean, the quality of them is more important than the extent of them.

05:46.817 --> 05:48.238
They're not bad, but they're not wonderful.

05:48.398 --> 05:49.800
But I have to talk to him.

05:49.820 --> 05:50.080
Yes.

05:50.200 --> 05:50.740
The point.

05:50.760 --> 05:52.142
Yes.

05:52.162 --> 05:52.422
Yes.

05:52.522 --> 05:54.724
Ricky Jay, the magician, is an interesting character.

05:54.804 --> 05:55.625
Do you know him?

05:56.546 --> 05:56.606
No.

05:57.366 --> 06:01.470
He's a really great, prominent magician.

06:01.490 --> 06:02.591
He's an entrepreneur.

06:02.611 --> 06:02.691
Yep.

06:02.711 --> 06:05.614
And he has what is said to be the finest collections

06:06.455 --> 06:08.458
of books on magic.

06:08.478 --> 06:08.799
Yes.

06:09.520 --> 06:14.708
Oh, yes, that's very... And he has learned his craft from these books.

06:14.748 --> 06:16.350
Yes, yes, yes.

06:16.370 --> 06:18.654
Those are useful books.

06:19.435 --> 06:24.022
Have No More was a collector of useless books, which is what interests me more, really.

06:24.483 --> 06:26.266
I'm more interested in useless books.

06:26.867 --> 06:31.253
So if anybody asks me, as of course one often does get asked, what do you specialize in?

06:31.273 --> 06:34.318
The only sensible answer I can give is useless books.

06:35.007 --> 06:38.671
And that was a definition that, well, most books are useless, you see, and this one is using them.

06:40.473 --> 06:41.334
Using them to what?

06:41.354 --> 06:41.835
To build a house?

06:42.476 --> 06:45.660
No, using them to work from.

06:45.680 --> 06:50.205
To build a house, in other words, to... As working tools.

06:50.525 --> 06:52.207
To figure some way to split the atom.

06:52.908 --> 06:56.552
No, using them, you use paperbacks.

06:58.094 --> 06:58.855
And...

06:59.847 --> 07:05.336
Actually, the two bookcases, that one and that, which you're looking at now, are my working tools at the moment.

07:05.357 --> 07:09.904
So I'm not only interested in useless books, but this is a more recent development because one changes.

07:11.126 --> 07:14.773
But a Shakespeare folio in the hands of Haven Amor is a useless book.

07:14.913 --> 07:16.776
All his books were useless, but he wasn't using them.

07:16.796 --> 07:18.379
He wouldn't say that.

07:18.528 --> 07:26.138
No, because he wouldn't use... The decision was to capture the energy contained in the text, and pass on to the generations yet unborn.

07:26.158 --> 07:30.304
Well, if you buy that one, then you're buying a mystic outlook.

07:31.145 --> 07:38.915
But functionally, and I agree with that, I think books are very important presences, and atmospheric presences in a room.

07:38.935 --> 07:41.558
Of course, I'm ready to talk a lot of nonsense on that subject.

07:41.578 --> 07:42.199
I wish you were.

07:42.339 --> 07:44.502
I need some quotes.

07:44.863 --> 07:47.286
But I think that...

07:48.025 --> 07:56.233
No, that he was not collecting functional books.

07:56.473 --> 07:59.196
Mostly they were kept in bank vaults or somewhere comparable.

08:01.318 --> 08:16.412
And it's wonderful to have as a sort of decor, like old furniture, as a decor in the house where it belongs, not in an antique shop.

08:16.949 --> 08:19.295
It's nice to have a library.

08:19.335 --> 08:21.701
Why do you think he acquired these?

08:21.721 --> 08:28.117
Well, I think he probably looked to the day when he would build his ideal home and ideal library and have them around him.

08:28.317 --> 08:34.232
He wanted to build, by the way, the Institute of Traditional Science on land that they acquired in Cambridge.

08:34.617 --> 08:36.340
I don't know if you're familiar with it.

08:36.360 --> 08:36.841
Yes, I am, yes.

08:36.921 --> 08:39.405
I know where he had, and no way has his civil house, yes.

08:39.585 --> 08:41.048
That whole little triangle there.

08:41.068 --> 08:43.692
Yes, he had nothing but legal actions, I know about all that.

08:43.772 --> 08:46.316
Well, I found out, well, it's all recorded.

08:46.336 --> 08:47.498
He wanted to pull things down.

08:47.598 --> 08:48.720
He did pull things down.

08:49.021 --> 08:50.063
He did pull things down.

08:50.203 --> 08:50.283
Yes.

08:50.483 --> 08:55.491
About authorisation, and all of these structures followed in a historic district.

08:55.512 --> 08:55.832
Yes.

08:56.369 --> 09:00.655
The interesting thing... That sounds like a behavior than what I was going to say.

09:00.675 --> 09:05.161
Well, I was interested, you were asking me about his, whether I knew there was a partner and so on.

09:05.201 --> 09:19.120
It interested me his money thing and his attitude to money and his projection about that because the impression he gave was an interesting one but the reality turns out not to have been interesting.

09:19.140 --> 09:26.190
The impression he gave was that he was a kind of, if you like, sort of philosopher king that he...

09:26.542 --> 09:45.429
was a very unusual kind of person, which he is, who had the ability, which is extremely rare, to think when he chose and live the philosophical life.

09:46.310 --> 09:52.178
And then when he chose, to turn off that and to turn on the money-making task.

09:52.748 --> 10:05.679
If he needed another supplied money, he would just tune into that wavelength and make what money he needed, and then turn off again and come back into the philosophical mode and buy what books he wanted.

10:05.719 --> 10:11.544
Now, that was an impressive scenario, and I believed in it.

10:12.525 --> 10:14.026
Did you believe he held all these patents?

10:14.907 --> 10:16.688
He never talked to me about patents.

10:16.988 --> 10:18.990
He didn't want to talk about how he made money.

10:19.010 --> 10:19.911
It was always a mystery.

10:20.031 --> 10:22.553
You mentioned to Bill Scheide about patents.

10:22.634 --> 10:23.075
Did he?

10:23.235 --> 10:23.435
Did he?

10:23.455 --> 10:25.477
I could sell another patent, he said.

10:25.497 --> 10:25.878
Yes, I see.

10:25.898 --> 10:26.518
$200 million.

10:26.659 --> 10:26.979
I see.

10:27.019 --> 10:28.340
Well, no, he didn't mention patents.

10:28.361 --> 10:36.950
He mentioned at the end something he'd invested heavily in, which I suppose I don't know.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.532
He may have talked about it.

10:38.632 --> 10:42.877
It may have been totally fiction, or it may have been true and disastrous.

10:42.957 --> 10:43.918
I have no idea.

10:43.958 --> 10:45.520
But apart from that particular thing,

10:46.765 --> 10:56.957
which I think he asked me not to mention, whether because it was totally untrue or whether it was totally private, I've no idea, but as he asked me not to mention, I did not mention it.

10:56.977 --> 10:59.159
It was a project, though.

10:59.179 --> 11:00.941
It was a project.

11:00.961 --> 11:09.131
And so when I learned that, in other words, I had totally, he totally gave the impression he was buying with his own money.

11:09.171 --> 11:15.338
And when I learned, and he lived fairly high, but you don't have to be very rich to live fairly high,

11:15.892 --> 11:24.264
When I learned that this was not so, only at the time of the sale, and that he was using somebody else's money, that was a little disillusioning.

11:26.507 --> 11:33.097
But he, I mean, in his private life, apart from his book life, he was very kind to us.

11:33.237 --> 11:41.348
We enjoyed his hospitality in Acapulco and in Arkansas.

11:42.530 --> 11:45.274
I didn't actually visit him in his home in

11:45.777 --> 11:47.879
So there was nothing secret about that.

11:47.899 --> 11:49.160
Other people have done so.

11:49.180 --> 11:51.602
A lot of people haven't, though.

11:51.722 --> 11:53.724
He really wouldn't let people into the Cambridge House.

11:53.744 --> 12:00.009
Well, he would have let me into the Cambridge House if we'd been staying in Boston and suggested calling.

12:00.089 --> 12:01.851
We were sufficiently friendly for that.

12:01.911 --> 12:06.334
And, say, Richard Lyon and Paul of Quaritches used to go there, and Arthur Freeman.

12:06.354 --> 12:08.416
It's not unknown for people to go there.

12:08.476 --> 12:11.539
Arthur's been in his house.

12:11.559 --> 12:12.640
Arthur has been in his house.

12:12.840 --> 12:13.741
Yes.

12:13.761 --> 12:15.362
Yeah.

12:16.422 --> 12:17.183
Arkansas.

12:17.203 --> 12:18.885
I thought it was Kentucky.

12:18.905 --> 12:19.086
Arkansas.

12:19.106 --> 12:20.327
That's where the wife is from.

12:20.347 --> 12:21.148
From Arkansas, yes.

12:23.131 --> 12:23.231
Okay.

12:23.251 --> 12:24.513
He's from Texas, I believe.

12:24.533 --> 12:25.434
Yes, yes.

12:25.454 --> 12:27.336
Do you know where in Texas?

12:27.356 --> 12:27.957
I can't remember.

12:29.159 --> 12:31.041
Do you think, is Haven no more his actual name?

12:32.583 --> 12:33.244
I don't know.

12:33.525 --> 12:35.848
He, I don't know.

12:35.868 --> 12:36.829
It's most unlikely.

12:36.889 --> 12:45.180
Of course, Haven no more, but he, it's not the kind of thing you ask a man, certainly not him, because he would have, he didn't want

12:46.240 --> 12:47.501
particularly private questions.

12:47.742 --> 12:53.308
Did he ever indicate what his education was?

12:54.309 --> 12:58.653
Yes, I can't quite remember, but my wife will remember, probably.

12:58.673 --> 13:02.037
I always forget people's private histories.

13:04.519 --> 13:12.568
The interesting thing about his education was that he, again, as we now know, he was a man who pretended to some extent

13:13.105 --> 13:27.400
They're not, I'm not dismissing him as a pretender in philosophy, because I think he, I had many talks with him, philosophical talks, if you like to use a grand phrase, and I always find him stimulating, but totally exhausting.

13:28.341 --> 13:41.475
And so vain as to be totally impossible and ridiculous, but of course it's very important to him not to seem ridiculous.

13:41.945 --> 13:45.650
to be taken totally seriously was very, very important in his life.

13:47.333 --> 13:52.840
I had farcically stupid talks with him.

13:52.860 --> 14:01.332
I heard him saying things that I thought nobody could make such an ass of himself publicly as he was doing.

14:04.617 --> 14:08.602
But that wouldn't please him to have that remark quoted to him.

14:08.763 --> 14:09.724
I think...

14:10.345 --> 14:26.370
He did, it was very important to him to be accepted as a, well, now as to his education, he gave one of the impressions that he was, one of the trails he laid was, of course, that he was fluent in Greek, for instance.

14:26.551 --> 14:32.620
It would not surprise me at all to learn that he didn't know Greek, but I may go wrong.

14:32.941 --> 14:33.762
Yes.

14:33.802 --> 14:36.927
Where the dedication is to his wife in Greek.

14:37.430 --> 14:38.831
Well, that's not a great achievement.

14:38.851 --> 14:39.552
That's not a great achievement.

14:39.572 --> 14:41.113
I mean, he could have had a little help about that.

14:41.134 --> 14:43.095
And it is ancient Greek, isn't it?

14:43.616 --> 14:47.780
No, from his conversation, I mean, dedication to his wife and Greek is easy game.

14:47.900 --> 14:54.166
From his conversation, you would imagine that he read Plato in the original with some ease and Homer and so on.

14:54.226 --> 14:56.028
Now, it wouldn't surprise me.

14:56.068 --> 14:57.709
Neither would surprise me.

14:57.989 --> 14:59.731
It wouldn't astonish me to learn that's true.

15:01.313 --> 15:03.895
My wife would actually be totally astonished to learn it's true.

15:03.915 --> 15:06.998
It wouldn't astonish me at all to hear that it's totally untrue.

15:07.332 --> 15:15.001
and that he had students or research assistants that provided, which is very usual, to provide a literal translation, and he made of it what he chose.

15:15.821 --> 15:17.023
I think that's much more likely.

15:17.664 --> 15:36.985
He gave one the impression that a hundred or so learned manuscripts was the measure of his achievement over the last 20 years or so, 25 years, whatever, and I sometimes wondered whether he'd written anything.

15:38.095 --> 15:41.238
Everything he has written is self-published, by the way.

15:41.259 --> 15:42.580
But practically nothing is published.

15:42.600 --> 15:44.262
I mean, anybody can scribble a few poems.

15:44.442 --> 15:45.103
That's what I'm saying.

15:45.123 --> 15:45.924
I mean... Yes.

15:45.944 --> 15:47.005
And that's about the measure of it.

15:47.025 --> 15:47.946
He's published himself.

15:48.066 --> 15:48.807
Again, yes.

15:48.867 --> 15:50.168
Oh, I see what you mean, yes.

15:50.228 --> 15:51.430
We call humanity publishing.

15:51.450 --> 15:52.111
Yes, quite.

15:52.171 --> 15:54.233
But I mean, it's about one slender thing.

15:54.313 --> 15:55.955
Oh, it's 16 poems.

15:56.095 --> 16:02.382
And he showed me, with pride, in his Arkansas home, a...

16:03.762 --> 16:12.592
a learned work, I forget what it was, published by the Bollingham Foundation or some such place, with, at the beginning, an acknowledgement to him or even a dedication.

16:12.612 --> 16:13.994
Well, again, that's not such a thing.

16:14.054 --> 16:16.116
It probably means he's provided some cash.

16:16.517 --> 16:17.378
Yes.

16:17.919 --> 16:21.823
So his achievement was very standard.

16:21.843 --> 16:33.617
And I think that he had considerable fear of going into print and not being recognized for the guru that he would have us think

16:34.238 --> 16:54.065
he was, and that's why he didn't go into print, because perhaps he felt, with his deep uncertainty, of course, which is the clue to him, that anything printed and subject to public scrutiny would show him up to be the man he didn't wish to seem.

16:54.086 --> 16:55.167
That's the clue to him.

16:55.868 --> 16:58.452
He said this is the clue to him, the deep uncertainty.

16:58.612 --> 17:00.955
Yes.

17:01.087 --> 17:17.486
In fact, I'd go probably further than I said, probably enough self-knowledge to realize that he really was a charlatan, but he would never have wanted that to be exposed, and so he didn't go into print.

17:18.627 --> 17:21.971
Do you remember the name of the town in Arkansas?

17:21.991 --> 17:22.371
No.

17:22.972 --> 17:23.973
Could it have been Harrison?

17:24.013 --> 17:26.376
Harrison, a name like that.

17:26.396 --> 17:27.957
His wife is from this town, is that right?

17:28.178 --> 17:28.878
I think so.

17:28.918 --> 17:30.300
And this is why they...

17:30.365 --> 17:30.786
Yes.

17:32.388 --> 17:33.530
They don't now, I believe.

17:33.550 --> 17:34.572
It's all sold, I'm not sure.

17:36.555 --> 17:38.578
I think Arkansas, Acapulco is sold.

17:38.618 --> 17:39.900
They don't have any children, right?

17:39.920 --> 17:40.962
No.

17:41.263 --> 17:42.064
He has children?

17:42.084 --> 17:45.069
Yes, I believe, by first, early marriage.

17:45.089 --> 17:46.110
So he does have a history.

17:46.170 --> 17:49.335
You see a lot of people, I mean, there have been wild speculations about him.

17:49.356 --> 17:49.436
Yes.

17:49.756 --> 17:52.501
As you can well imagine, in the book circle.

17:53.122 --> 17:57.148
The CIA becomes full-blown out of the 1950s.

17:57.736 --> 18:06.686
No, he talked about, and this I totally believe, he talked with recollection about the Korean War.

18:07.487 --> 18:08.868
MacArthur's staff, right?

18:08.888 --> 18:16.536
I didn't know about MacArthur's staff, but about being blown up by a bomb and arriving safely down again as if he were just on a safe parachute.

18:16.556 --> 18:21.362
Somehow the way he talked about this made me believe in it absolutely, and I still believe in it absolutely.

18:21.722 --> 18:24.385
Do you think that was the epiphanous moment in his wife?

18:25.546 --> 18:42.865
I mean, if you read this Institute of Traditional Science, and what is traditional science, you read their preface to the sale, the man is really, he reads poems.

18:42.885 --> 18:45.128
They're just consumed with visions of death.

18:45.148 --> 18:46.169
Yes, yes.

18:46.229 --> 18:48.552
Frightening, I mean, disturbing, I think.

18:48.572 --> 18:48.772
Yes, yes.

18:49.473 --> 18:52.296
Well, he wasn't a trivial author, I mean, he wasn't,

18:52.883 --> 18:54.605
He's not a man I shall ever forget.

18:54.766 --> 18:57.189
He was not a negligible man.

18:57.269 --> 19:06.382
Except whether he was... You see, another great vanity of his, of great importance to it, was that he should seem very young.

19:06.402 --> 19:08.525
I think he's about my age.

19:08.605 --> 19:09.065
I'm 66.

19:09.186 --> 19:12.130
I think he's about that sort of age, probably.

19:12.871 --> 19:16.756
And he would have had us think he was 45, I mean, for a long time.

19:16.796 --> 19:20.001
He's constantly looking at mirrors, I'm told.

19:20.021 --> 19:20.241
He's...

19:20.575 --> 19:22.918
He is constantly looking at himself in mirrors.

19:22.938 --> 19:23.439
Is he?

19:23.679 --> 19:26.523
Yes, yes, yes.

19:26.583 --> 19:32.592
I guess this was from some person who's happened to see him often.

19:32.612 --> 19:33.132
Yes, yes.

19:34.835 --> 19:44.588
Then he was, I mean, he was a very obsessional person, but in his Arkansas house, which was, I mean, he treated us with considerable hospitality.

19:44.689 --> 19:50.076
He put us up, not in the house, because nobody must, this is part of the tale, but...

19:50.866 --> 19:56.154
He put us up in the very hyper-luxurious hotel called Las Brisas.

19:56.855 --> 19:59.899
He said, I don't stay in luxurious hotels.

20:00.000 --> 20:00.981
I don't dine out.

20:01.722 --> 20:02.804
It's not a hotel in town.

20:02.984 --> 20:09.113
It's a famous sort of villa settlement up the hill, which is in fact a hotel.

20:09.834 --> 20:11.777
New Mexico.

20:12.348 --> 20:13.209
New Mexico?

20:13.650 --> 20:14.291
No, not New Mexico.

20:14.311 --> 20:14.791
No, Mexico.

20:14.911 --> 20:15.933
Sorry, Mexico.

20:15.953 --> 20:16.433
Mexico.

20:16.654 --> 20:18.476
Acapulca, I'm talking about now.

20:18.496 --> 20:19.998
I'm sorry, that is some kind of concern.

20:20.078 --> 20:23.182
No, I've switched to Acapulca, his house in Acapulca.

20:23.923 --> 20:25.285
He was very obsessional about that.

20:25.886 --> 20:27.428
Did you see the house?

20:27.448 --> 20:35.077
Yes, but we were put in one of these villas and treated very, very well, frankly expensive and all that.

20:35.818 --> 20:40.144
And his house was built...

20:41.153 --> 20:48.064
to some mystic scale of proportion that he purported to have discovered in the Mayan civilization.

20:48.986 --> 21:02.287
And, well, briefly, once, for instance, Laurier was showing us around some of it, and Charlotte, my wife, sat down on a sofa that was out in a sort of open spot.

21:03.469 --> 21:06.334
And Haven came out and clearly frowned.

21:07.647 --> 21:14.314
And when she got up, he went over to it and dusted it with his hand and put things straight, you see.

21:14.675 --> 21:16.377
I mean, he was obsessional to that extent.

21:16.397 --> 21:18.038
What are you making of this?

21:18.058 --> 21:20.000
Well, I leave that to the psychoanalysts.

21:20.061 --> 21:22.844
I mean, he was... He's not supposed to be concerned with things.

21:22.864 --> 21:24.585
I don't know about... These are things, that's right.

21:24.606 --> 21:25.446
It's obsessional.

21:25.466 --> 21:27.909
I mean, the word anal comes to mind.

21:27.949 --> 21:28.690
I don't know what.

21:28.710 --> 21:30.252
I mean, people use these loose words.

21:30.292 --> 21:32.254
But he was not normal in that way.

21:32.394 --> 21:35.157
He was quite... Did any of this...

21:35.845 --> 21:37.727
Why wouldn't that frighten you to disturb you?

21:37.747 --> 21:39.368
Well, I'll tell you another thing about him.

21:39.689 --> 21:52.882
And I think, I mean, through all this that I'm saying, his underlying kindness, believe it or not, kindliness, that I was very affectionate about him.

21:54.563 --> 22:03.372
Not only because he's chosen to buy books from me, but because I think we did enjoy each other's company, and...

22:03.959 --> 22:30.878
conversation and talked of quite fundamental things and I mean one days of him in a long while was enough but it was it interested me but for instance a good thing was going back to books his response to books

22:33.018 --> 22:34.039
was very emotional.

22:35.741 --> 22:39.145
I bought for him once.

22:39.185 --> 22:40.727
It only happened once that I bought something.

22:40.747 --> 22:42.669
I don't buy things for people at auction.

22:42.729 --> 22:43.530
It's not my life.

22:43.770 --> 22:44.891
It doesn't interest me.

22:44.931 --> 22:49.296
I wouldn't mind because it's money for nothing.

22:49.396 --> 22:52.860
But that's not how I spend my time doing that.

22:53.240 --> 22:59.127
But there was one occasion when Haven asked me, because he bought a notable Yates manuscript from me,

23:00.322 --> 23:04.768
to buy another one at Sotheby's, the one he bought, hadn't been from Sotheby's, it was mine.

23:04.808 --> 23:13.399
And an important, hate the word, important manuscript of Yeats' poems dropped up.

23:13.419 --> 23:14.340
It was in the garden sale.

23:14.380 --> 23:17.444
I think these two Yeats things didn't sell at the garden sale, actually.

23:17.464 --> 23:18.606
There were only two things that didn't.

23:19.106 --> 23:21.249
But that was neither here nor there.

23:21.569 --> 23:22.030
Six lots.

23:22.050 --> 23:22.731
Well, those are two of them.

23:23.172 --> 23:26.616
Anyway, probably they were too ambitious in prices.

23:27.828 --> 23:34.999
The 8th manuscript I bought, yes, and it looked a boring thing in a big sort of old ledger, I'd see.

23:35.019 --> 23:47.257
So, bindings, and that's an obsessional subject, if any ever is, and the condition of books generally, but bindings and boxes for bindings, and all this is very important for Haven, you see.

23:47.337 --> 23:49.481
Box things in beautifully, like relicers.

23:50.422 --> 23:53.487
That doesn't figure according to his mandate, binding.

23:53.507 --> 23:54.308
That's exterior.

23:54.473 --> 24:01.563
Well, it's exterior, but it's like a reliquary covering a relic or any metaphor you choose to use.

24:01.583 --> 24:16.063
So this particular manuscript, it was in fact very important for him to have things boxed properly, and I took it to a binder he knows and I know in Oxford who boxed it handsomely in green leather and all that, a big object it became.

24:16.123 --> 24:19.688
I took it to America during my next visit and we arranged to meet

24:20.039 --> 24:30.173
at Boston, and he was going, he took me in Laurier, met me at the airport, and drove me to some hotel, I forget which, where we would have lunch, and I would hand this over.

24:30.213 --> 24:45.473
And Laurier and I were sitting at a table, and he came in, and I had this green thing, and put it in front of him on the table, we cleared a little space before lunch.

24:46.280 --> 24:52.906
And he simply said, excuse me, I can't face this, and went out again for about 10 minutes to wherever he went, Laverture or somewhere.

24:53.486 --> 25:01.573
It just, the very sight of it was overwhelming to him, and he had to compose himself and come back and be able to view it.

25:01.593 --> 25:06.577
Well, that's a very genuine response to an exciting object.

25:06.597 --> 25:08.579
And this was absolutely authentic.

25:08.599 --> 25:09.840
I mean, this was not anything written.

25:09.860 --> 25:14.344
I don't think he'd rehearsed this or planned it or anything.

25:14.384 --> 25:15.865
That touches me, by the way.

25:15.946 --> 25:30.569
And something else he had for me, which was a very emotional object, which managed to give diaries of the dancer Nijinsky.

25:31.550 --> 25:34.795
Which really didn't figure in that collection, by the way.

25:34.815 --> 25:35.637
It was in the garden cell.

25:35.657 --> 25:38.000
But I mean, it didn't figure as part of the collection.

25:38.381 --> 25:43.489
You said it was an outsider, as a... Well, I mean, it just didn't figure as an item in the sky.

25:43.722 --> 25:46.264
if I understood the scope of it.

25:46.284 --> 25:47.545
It didn't figure to me to be part of it.

25:47.705 --> 26:07.482
Well, it was an artist's... I mean, Haven would use some... If he took dance as an art, it would be necessary for him to think that Nizhinsky was the greatest dancer in the history of something, and here were his private thoughts, so this was figured, I would say.

26:07.563 --> 26:08.884
I would think so.

26:09.004 --> 26:12.767
And in this room, I was telling him about it once, when I had it,

26:13.304 --> 26:19.233
and started to, he asked me about it and I explained why I found it a very exciting document.

26:19.253 --> 26:21.195
This is something you wanted to acquire for yourself?

26:21.215 --> 26:36.698
Yes, I bought it, and I suppose I, myself explaining it quite emotionally anyway, he said, well, stop, I can't bet it anymore, and I must just have this.

26:36.718 --> 26:40.223
And he, again, he found it to

26:41.907 --> 26:49.654
to upset him, to hear, and he just identified with it.

26:49.674 --> 27:03.086
Is this, I heard a story somewhere that, I don't know if this was you, but this was something, there was something that somebody else planned to get at an auction, telling him about it, and it didn't apply it.

27:03.106 --> 27:03.627
It wasn't me, no.

27:03.667 --> 27:10.193
And it's so aroused, and he might now pick the other guy who told him about it, and acquire it, and I have the names,

27:10.578 --> 27:16.344
No, no, I didn't buy it for him.

27:18.105 --> 27:20.007
You mean the Nizhinsky, I didn't buy it for him.

27:20.067 --> 27:22.089
No, no, I owned it.

27:22.210 --> 27:27.595
Everything that I sold him I owned, except that particular Yeats.

27:27.955 --> 27:31.819
So you basically acquire for stock as the phrase, though.

27:31.859 --> 27:35.843
Yes, I don't like the phrase, but yes, perfectly true.

27:36.565 --> 27:38.307
Well, a better phrase.

27:38.427 --> 27:38.887
No, it is.

27:38.907 --> 27:40.429
No, I'm not criticizing you for using it.

27:40.449 --> 27:41.250
It's the general phrase.

27:41.330 --> 27:41.830
Yes.

27:41.950 --> 27:42.070
Yes.

27:42.511 --> 27:42.991
Yes.

27:43.051 --> 27:47.356
Which impresses me because that is traditional book.

27:47.536 --> 27:47.836
Yes.

27:48.337 --> 27:48.997
Yes.

27:49.017 --> 27:50.339
Otherwise, it's just trading.

27:50.679 --> 27:52.781
And that is mostly what happens in book selling now.

27:53.302 --> 27:56.785
That as soon as anybody gets a good thing, he rings up somebody.

27:56.805 --> 28:00.369
Or there's the terrible phrase, I have somebody for this.

28:01.930 --> 28:05.073
Whereas proper book selling, I think, is that you have things.

28:05.133 --> 28:05.914
And if somebody...

28:06.535 --> 28:12.063
chooses to come and view what you have and wants to have something of it, then he buys it.

28:12.824 --> 28:13.986
Let's talk a little bit about that.

28:15.248 --> 28:16.710
I put no log on the fire.

28:16.730 --> 28:19.073
Let's see how this machine is doing.

28:20.235 --> 28:24.201
Oh, I'm sorry.

28:24.261 --> 28:26.965
...which he was born.

28:26.985 --> 28:32.593
They were doing mushrooms, you know, and it was tumbled down for the 17th century.

28:32.613 --> 28:32.813
Beautiful.

28:35.442 --> 28:38.085
Did you arrive prior to the power station or after?

28:38.906 --> 28:39.246
Before.

28:39.567 --> 28:41.329
I would have guessed that.

28:41.349 --> 28:43.551
I don't mind the power station.

28:43.571 --> 28:44.332
It's not atomic.

28:44.993 --> 28:45.473
Oh, it's not?

28:45.533 --> 28:46.695
It looks atomic.

28:47.315 --> 28:47.435
There.

28:47.455 --> 28:47.575
There.

28:47.596 --> 28:47.996
Oh, great.

28:48.476 --> 28:49.217
I feel better.

28:49.237 --> 28:54.283
It's on the railway lines, and it starts where or wherever you come to.

28:55.484 --> 28:56.465
That's right.

28:58.868 --> 29:02.893
My family has a house on Cape Cod, and he's facing these days.

29:03.073 --> 29:04.234
There he is.

29:04.737 --> 29:05.899
there's a power station.

29:06.119 --> 29:11.106
For years I thought it was because there is a nuclear station in Plymouth, and I always thought that was it.

29:11.687 --> 29:19.638
And it's not, but the nuclear station is actually 20 miles further, so that now doesn't bother me anymore.

29:20.459 --> 29:23.143
I don't think you'd like to live under the shadow of a nuclear station.

29:23.383 --> 29:26.187
No.

29:26.387 --> 29:29.952
Let's talk about your own, unless you feel that there are any

29:30.370 --> 29:33.414
if fruitful areas I could pursue any further or more.

29:33.574 --> 29:35.476
No, I think we probably talked around that.

29:35.676 --> 29:41.243
It's almost... Were you depressed when you heard about... The sale?

29:41.283 --> 29:44.126
Not the sale, so much the circumstances.

29:45.848 --> 29:46.549
Yes, a little bit.

29:46.609 --> 29:48.391
I suppose I felt slightly let down.

29:48.591 --> 29:53.677
I felt that there'd been some deception in our relationship, if you like.

29:53.837 --> 29:56.641
Shakespeare would have been the outside falsehood path.

29:56.741 --> 29:57.762
I mean, it's almost like...

29:58.585 --> 30:06.276
I mean, this man had been pretending to be something he wasn't, and I thought I was rather sad for him, but I felt it's always very humiliating when you are exposed.

30:06.296 --> 30:15.830
I wasn't exposed for anything scandalous, as far as I was concerned, but he was shown to be a lesser man, if you like, and that's a bit sad that he had to appear like that.

30:15.850 --> 30:17.673
And certainly not the man that he purported himself.

30:17.693 --> 30:20.136
No, but I was sorry for him for having to say this, if you like.

30:20.577 --> 30:22.199
Has he been in contact since this?

30:22.279 --> 30:22.520
No.

30:22.760 --> 30:23.481
Yes, sorry.

30:24.422 --> 30:27.647
He wrote me a touching letter saying that...

30:28.893 --> 30:36.604
that he was faced with, I think his phrase was selling his spiritual children into slavery.

30:39.107 --> 30:48.400
Not a phrase I think should be quoted as it was a private letter, but that's what he... I won't, but he has used... Used it by other people, I see.

30:48.841 --> 30:49.121
Yeah.

30:49.402 --> 30:50.904
Stop phrase, okay.

30:51.425 --> 30:57.713
Well, the image, I can't say it's the same phrase, but the image of the children being sold in the country.

30:57.914 --> 30:58.174
Yes.

30:58.373 --> 31:00.156
I think that's fair enough.

31:00.417 --> 31:07.431
But I can sympathize with that, and that is the kind of image that you would... Don't worry about that.

31:08.412 --> 31:20.095
Okay, let's talk about you, because I am quite interested in... We started talking about Colin Franklin, the collector, and also the book viewer.

31:20.277 --> 31:32.689
I don't like the word dealer actually, but it's a very common word and it comes in all the time and it got quite historic, it's not just new.

31:34.371 --> 31:35.552
But somehow it's the wrong word.

31:35.572 --> 31:38.916
I think dealer suggests making deals on the stock exchange or something.

31:38.936 --> 31:39.897
I don't make deals.

31:40.277 --> 31:41.238
You sell things.

31:42.800 --> 31:46.183
If people ask what I am, I'll say I'm a bookseller.

31:46.838 --> 31:54.825
And I think other sides of my life is rather pretentious to say if one is doing anything else.

31:54.925 --> 32:01.431
I enjoy out of self-respect, I think, writing things.

32:01.611 --> 32:16.525
I do enjoy writing things simply because it seems to me that to buy books at one price and sell them at another is not a particularly satisfactory way of parting your years in this world.

32:17.298 --> 32:18.039
better than that.

32:18.840 --> 32:21.644
I don't mean that my writing is better.

32:21.665 --> 32:27.413
I mean that something other than merely buying and selling, I like to have on hand.

32:28.475 --> 32:34.604
Before we continue, I don't, I know that I've gathered to myself, I did mention the creative people who do collect, and I mentioned Baskin.

32:34.684 --> 32:37.208
Could you think of any other people that would be wise for me to?

32:37.408 --> 32:38.289
Artists who collect.

32:38.590 --> 32:46.782
Not necessarily of painters, of any kind of artists, a writer, a creative person who collects.

32:47.673 --> 32:49.816
David Garrick, you know.

32:49.876 --> 32:50.317
Oh, yes.

32:50.397 --> 32:51.758
If there was such a person today.

32:51.778 --> 32:51.999
Yes.

32:52.640 --> 32:54.182
He's a wonderful example, I think.

32:54.202 --> 32:55.043
Yes, yes.

32:55.884 --> 32:57.826
I'm impressed by Michael Sadler.

32:57.927 --> 32:58.748
William Morris.

32:58.828 --> 32:59.749
Outstanding.

32:59.789 --> 33:03.714
Michael Sadler, I think, was an interesting... Yes, yes.

33:03.734 --> 33:05.016
William Morris is a good example.

33:05.036 --> 33:05.897
He's a great example.

33:06.097 --> 33:08.761
He's a great example, yes.

33:08.781 --> 33:12.546
But I can't think of any living, breathing examples.

33:14.529 --> 33:17.072
I can't think of who I know who's...

33:17.457 --> 33:20.600
out of the blue, think of ripest painters.

33:21.101 --> 33:24.345
It's become a much more expensive thing to do.

33:24.445 --> 33:26.387
So really rich people collect these days.

33:26.427 --> 33:28.369
That's one of the... Well, it's hadnesses.

33:28.469 --> 33:29.470
It is still accessible.

33:29.550 --> 33:40.282
I mean, you know, the night before the garden sale got underway, the very night, Sotheby's sold to Kuni to a Japanese for $22 million.

33:40.822 --> 33:45.508
And the whole garden sale, $314, was $16 million.

33:45.648 --> 33:45.928
Yes.

33:46.162 --> 34:00.320
And yet, well, this is relative, this is relative, but you see, the people say Oxford, which is seven miles from where we're talking, there are no Oxford collectors these days, because they can't afford it on university salaries.

34:01.321 --> 34:15.038
A generation ago, John Sparrow, Warden Wall-Sales, or a doctor called Ben-Jule Jensen, and...

34:16.672 --> 34:24.260
and an outsider, I mean, outside the university, Simon Nelsmith, could form quite notable collections.

34:25.301 --> 34:29.866
Well, Nelsmith's a fairly wealthy man, but the others I don't think were really.

34:29.886 --> 34:40.637
If you had taste and chose what you wanted and cared about books, you could form a magnificent collection without big outlay, apart from inflation and that sort of stuff.

34:40.938 --> 34:42.760
I've had, by the way, 20 years.

34:43.361 --> 34:46.665
My book life has been divided into two after I left university.

34:46.685 --> 34:51.211
I was 20 years in publishing, and I've been 20 years a bookseller, so that's this year.

34:51.231 --> 34:55.597
You're very interesting to me because your life has been involved with books all this time.

34:55.637 --> 34:58.220
Books from just about every... Yes.

34:58.601 --> 35:00.743
On every side of the side.

35:01.444 --> 35:04.929
And I've never had any money, and still don't have any money.

35:05.329 --> 35:09.915
But in the later years, when I was

35:10.165 --> 35:12.508
in publishing my later years.

35:13.129 --> 35:24.243
And when I found that I didn't actually have an overdraft at the bank, I found that it was very pleasant to go out to a bookshop and spend a few pounds on a nice book.

35:25.465 --> 35:27.387
Did you become a collector after you were publishing?

35:27.407 --> 35:27.988
No, before.

35:28.168 --> 35:30.111
But I mean, become a collector is a grand phrase.

35:30.191 --> 35:34.857
I used to go out and buy some nice books occasionally, a nice book, and spend longer and longer

35:35.393 --> 36:00.372
after lunch in mags or quarry or somewhere very variable like that and buy something i couldn't afford and agonize every for night or something like that and and so on and so i had formed by the time i chose to leave publishing quite a nice well two collections really i got a good collection of private press books with which i'm a bit sort of um

36:01.448 --> 36:06.893
associated, if anybody associates me with anything, because I wrote a book about private places and so on.

36:09.816 --> 36:15.422
Well, in a way, I'm sort of out of it a bit now, because one gets interested in other things.

36:15.442 --> 36:24.791
I think that's a great, for me, a great pleasure of bookselling, is that one is not necessarily a specialist, but it's possible to follow whim into other directions.

36:26.793 --> 36:29.295
It may not be prosperous, but it's possible.

36:31.030 --> 36:51.182
But you see, the point of saying all this is that in the 1960s, which is not all that time ago as my life sees it, between 1963 and 1970, I performed a pretty good collection of private press books, including a Kermsker Press set printed on vellum.

36:51.871 --> 37:01.585
all those books which were printed on vellum, except for one important exception, which was the Chaucer, and that was the copy inscribed by Morris and Byrne Jones to Swinburne.

37:02.607 --> 37:05.872
So... Where is that copy now?

37:05.892 --> 37:08.616
In Paul Mellon's collection, I think.

37:08.636 --> 37:12.922
And that, without having money, I could collect these things, you see.

37:13.703 --> 37:19.532
And so... And I formed a good collection of...

37:19.934 --> 37:33.126
color plate books, as they're called, aquatint books, really, that was my period, period of about 1780 to 75 to 1835, and wrote a book about that.

37:33.666 --> 37:49.300
But the thing is that the scene has changed, and anybody wanting to make such a collection now would have to be fairly wealthy, not like your Japanese example, but fairly wealthy, so that it's become an uncivilized thing,

37:49.853 --> 37:59.004
which the lousy rich can do, and which well-supported institutions can do with some hesitation and condescension.

37:59.905 --> 38:18.949
And the pleasantly interested men who would like, or women who would like to, chiefly men who collect, would like to buy books, can't.

38:19.182 --> 38:25.075
They buy great recognizable books, but I think there still are delightful surprises out there.

38:25.095 --> 38:37.984
They can still buy things, but new subjects, I mean, I feel great contempt for, one shouldn't feel contempt, it's bad things for you, but I feel great contempt for modern first edition collecting and the whole... Why?

38:38.318 --> 38:45.229
the whole world of the dust wrapper, which is a useless thing I throw away.

38:45.390 --> 38:59.012
Yes, I was totally shocked, totally shocked to hear a friend who was a librarian of a university in the United States where I was teaching for a term a couple of years ago.

38:59.032 --> 38:59.472
Where was it?

39:00.174 --> 39:02.578
Tulsa, Oklahoma, University of Tulsa.

39:02.658 --> 39:03.499
Tom Staley there?

39:03.597 --> 39:04.438
Tom Staley was there.

39:04.478 --> 39:06.380
I'm not... Oh, yes.

39:06.640 --> 39:11.945
Well, I was with Tom about a couple of months ago in Austin.

39:13.006 --> 39:21.375
No, this is the librarian at the university, who was a good friend, and with whom I went to Chicago while I was there on a book call.

39:22.035 --> 39:28.742
And we stayed with the librarian of Chicago University, who's just died.

39:29.843 --> 39:33.587
And we went to his seminar and were asked to talk.

39:34.512 --> 39:51.150
the librarian said to them that about two-thirds of the value, I forget what he said, of their collections, their special collections, their precious special collections, and they spent tremendously on them, were in the dust trappers.

39:51.170 --> 39:59.760
Now, what is the university doing with spending two-thirds of its colossal, no, no, this is Tulsa, on dust trappers?

40:00.078 --> 40:01.960
which are useless bits of adornment.

40:01.980 --> 40:03.422
Do you think Tom had anything?

40:03.442 --> 40:04.524
Yes, actually, yes.

40:05.405 --> 40:08.809
I mean, I'm not, again, you mustn't quote me on this.

40:08.909 --> 40:14.656
That's probably why they hired him for Texas, because it's consistent with the Texas mandate.

40:14.676 --> 40:16.879
I think they hired him.

40:16.939 --> 40:20.263
He's a very good person to be at the Human Services Center, I think.

40:20.648 --> 40:21.449
Very nice person.

40:21.469 --> 40:22.090
I like him.

40:22.110 --> 40:23.152
He's a very good person.

40:23.212 --> 40:27.759
He's probably diplomatic and isn't going to continue the rather... He's like Deca Turner.

40:27.779 --> 40:28.240
That's right.

40:28.540 --> 40:30.704
And he's not passionate about books.

40:30.844 --> 40:32.426
He's got a nice Joyce collection.

40:32.907 --> 40:34.269
He's interested in Joyce.

40:35.210 --> 40:36.492
And he's interested in Joyce.

40:36.553 --> 40:37.654
And he's interested in Joyce.

40:38.315 --> 40:44.705
And modern writers and women writers and all these fashionable things.

40:45.186 --> 40:45.947
But...

40:46.687 --> 40:48.169
and in filling the gaps.

40:48.189 --> 40:58.544
He's the man they need for now, I think, because they've had the adventures, they've had the explorations for the North and South Pole, and now what they need is to live with it a little bit.

40:58.564 --> 40:59.946
And he's presiding over this.

41:00.166 --> 41:01.107
Settle down a little bit.

41:01.127 --> 41:01.348
Yeah.

41:02.189 --> 41:04.893
And that process is in many ways.

41:04.913 --> 41:06.194
Did you know Lou Feltman, though?

41:06.475 --> 41:06.735
Yes.

41:07.857 --> 41:11.241
Could you give me any... Yes, I admired Lou Feltman.

41:11.301 --> 41:15.968
He was one...

41:16.167 --> 41:20.372
perhaps a rather simple thing to say by Luke Feldman, is that he was perfectly a man of his word.

41:22.194 --> 41:23.296
Can I quote you directly on this?

41:23.316 --> 41:24.537
Yes, I have no objection to that.

41:25.138 --> 41:36.012
I have Charles Hamilton on the other side, you know, who's, frankly, such vicious, I think, damn well, if you're alive, libelous things.

41:36.152 --> 41:40.757
I see, well, he was... Without any backup, as a matter of fact.

41:40.898 --> 41:45.263
In my connections with him, he...

41:45.648 --> 41:53.257
He died, I forget what year, but I hadn't been many years in books saying he died, but we did several quite, for me, quite major things together.

41:53.277 --> 41:59.504
And he was perfectly correct in everything he did with me.

42:00.225 --> 42:02.587
And he trusted me, and I trusted him.

42:02.768 --> 42:08.574
He learnt to trust me, I'll tell you how, it's not worth quoting particularly, forbid it, but it's not interesting.

42:09.515 --> 42:15.402
Over a small thing, I'd bought, I had here a collection of manuscripts

42:16.698 --> 42:21.644
a not terribly important author called Richard Le Gallien, an author of the 90s.

42:21.664 --> 42:22.185
How do we spell it?

42:22.245 --> 42:27.031
An author of the 90s, L-E... You mustn't ask me how you spell things, my spelling's terrible.

42:27.051 --> 42:28.373
L-E with a G, then I'll find it.

42:28.433 --> 42:30.375
L-E and then the next word, Le Gallien.

42:30.395 --> 42:33.619
It may even be Le Gallien, it's Le Gallien.

42:33.639 --> 42:39.907
Anyway, and Feldman wanted to buy these, they were very attractive.

42:41.249 --> 42:46.435
And I told him I'd bought them from Krauss in New York, and...

42:47.056 --> 42:49.779
and that he could have them for 10% more than I paid for them.

42:50.459 --> 42:55.384
I don't tell that, I tell that aspect of it, it's only stupid, because I should have asked much more.

42:55.945 --> 42:58.548
But I suppose it's an expression of no confidence.

42:58.588 --> 42:59.609
Anyway, that's what I said.

42:59.829 --> 43:01.431
And he agreed.

43:02.452 --> 43:11.501
And then to my surprise, he said, well, I think I'd, if you wouldn't mind just showing me Krause's receipt to prove to me that you're telling me the truth about that.

43:12.382 --> 43:15.645
Yes, that's surprising.

43:15.997 --> 43:27.975
We found Christ's receipt and showed it to him and he said, I could see that impressed him because people say these things and they don't even know he could see that I bought it for that and I was offering it to him for 10% more.

43:28.576 --> 43:32.521
Ever offered, I think he trusted me totally.

43:33.403 --> 43:36.267
He was a bit of a pirate and

43:36.989 --> 43:41.796
And he wanted, I told you that I owned... What was the word, pirate?

43:41.816 --> 43:42.176
Yes.

43:42.237 --> 43:43.098
C-I-R-A-T-E.

43:43.118 --> 43:52.932
Yes, I told you that I owned the collection of, this was another good thing in our relationship, of Kelmscott books printed on vellum.

43:53.933 --> 43:56.156
And he wanted to buy it.

43:57.819 --> 43:58.660
He wanted to actually...

43:59.720 --> 44:02.924
I did, you know, cite a minute.

44:03.084 --> 44:06.788
I'd prepared a whole catalogue of books printed on vellum.

44:06.828 --> 44:10.573
I don't do catalogues now, but this I'd done.

44:12.335 --> 44:20.685
And before I'd offered it for sale, I'd prepared the catalogue, put it into proof.

44:21.686 --> 44:27.853
And he came here at that moment, and he wanted to buy, as well as held in a gesture, I wanted to buy a whole catalogue, you see, of books printed on vellum.

44:28.137 --> 44:30.701
I wasn't against selling it, it was a great help to me to sell a big thing.

44:31.702 --> 44:38.472
And we agreed the price at which you'd buy it, and that was that.

44:38.492 --> 44:40.375
And, hello?

44:43.340 --> 44:47.766
And he went away, that was that.

44:47.866 --> 44:55.598
And then about, so we arranged, I don't know what we arranged, a dispatch or something, and about two or three weeks.

44:55.618 --> 44:57.621
I'm sorry, do you think these things went to Texas probably?

44:58.917 --> 44:59.518
No, he didn't.

44:59.538 --> 45:01.600
I know the future there.

45:01.720 --> 45:03.902
He may have hoped they would, didn't?

45:04.482 --> 45:12.410
Two or three... A short time later, I was on holiday, I think, and the dollar fell against the pound.

45:12.610 --> 45:14.051
I'd sold it in pounds, yes.

45:15.633 --> 45:28.165
And Feldman sent me a letter or a cable or something saying that he would have to offer less because he wasn't prepared to...

45:28.769 --> 45:37.098
pay more than that, and he was now finding himself paying more, so he wished to adjust the price.

45:37.278 --> 45:42.384
I sent him a telegram saying that the books were sold in pounds.

45:43.625 --> 45:54.777
If he didn't wish to go ahead, would he send me a telegram, that's how telegrams entered, before or within three days or something like this, and he sent a telegram saying he wished to buy the collection.

45:55.668 --> 45:59.912
Again, I think that earned his respect, that I sort of stood out, you see.

46:00.092 --> 46:06.318
And he felt that we were on terms, and we... Well, you understood each other.

46:06.378 --> 46:07.860
Understood each other, yes.

46:08.300 --> 46:09.081
Yes, I think so.

46:09.161 --> 46:13.365
I mean, I don't like this kind of thing, because, so am I being a businessman, I'm not against that.

46:13.425 --> 46:15.988
I don't like tension in it, and I now don't have it.

46:16.108 --> 46:19.551
But that was a sort of fraught moment, but I thought it was a stand to take.

46:19.691 --> 46:22.274
But maybe it was the incident that had to take place.

46:22.294 --> 46:23.095
Yes, that's right.

46:23.115 --> 46:23.896
That's the sort of thing.

46:23.916 --> 46:25.337
That's the sort of thing.

46:25.435 --> 46:39.155
But he, apart from business things like that, he was, like many booksellers, he put a tough front to the world.

46:39.776 --> 46:42.640
But he was devoted to his books.

46:43.561 --> 46:45.784
He knew his books.

46:46.005 --> 46:48.909
He knew his books and would get, well, in a certain way, he knew his books.

46:49.289 --> 46:50.691
It depends what you mean by new.

46:51.052 --> 46:52.814
He certainly knew his detective fiction.

46:52.834 --> 46:53.215
Yes.

46:53.701 --> 46:57.366
Texas has probably the finest detective fiction collection because of this.

46:57.406 --> 46:57.967
Because of him.

46:58.288 --> 46:58.788
Because of him.

46:58.808 --> 47:00.491
He used to.

47:00.551 --> 47:05.758
He said, I remember when he couldn't sleep, he got up in the middle of the night and just liked running around among his books.

47:05.778 --> 47:12.007
I mean, I don't know what was going through his head, whether it was dollars or literature, but anyway, he liked the presence of his books.

47:12.027 --> 47:14.231
Do you think he was good for Texas, for his rights?

47:14.251 --> 47:15.773
I think he was wonderful for Texas.

47:15.933 --> 47:18.337
He was harried at some new ways, particularly.

47:18.357 --> 47:22.122
Yes, I think it was a great moment for buying all sorts of...

47:23.367 --> 47:44.548
this new concept of the archive was an originality and they now live with it in a farcical way because it's all going to pieces as you know the 20th century bits of kitchen roll on which Cocteau scribbled his ideas or something become

47:44.765 --> 48:13.455
yellow and fragile and fall to pieces and so now but they have the great conservation yes they have the great conservation that's where all the money's gone but in fact it takes um it takes a week to complete or month or whatever it is to complete the conservation of one set of proofs so um as they've got uh buildings full of it's uh they can't catch up with it do you think they brought a lot of

48:14.161 --> 48:23.751
You're bound to buy a lot of junk when you buy as much as they did, but they bought a very large amount of genuinely useful stuff.

48:23.971 --> 48:27.074
They cast a widen-up, and they tend to bring in a lot of different things.

48:27.395 --> 48:27.755
Yes, yes.

48:27.775 --> 48:29.197
No, I think they did very well.

48:29.217 --> 48:41.029
Nicholas does say, for the record, and that's why I will call him, that he does feel that their policy, of course, this is from the scholarly side, of not allowing things to be copied is indefensible.

48:41.347 --> 48:42.068
Yes.

48:42.088 --> 48:46.915
And that they are perhaps the only institution in the Western world that does this, I think.

48:48.597 --> 48:50.059
There may be one or two others.

48:50.260 --> 48:56.749
You know, if you want microfiche or microfilm of the Robert Graves letters, you can't get them.

48:56.849 --> 48:57.169
Yes.

48:57.650 --> 48:58.471
And that's policy.

48:58.691 --> 48:59.012
Yes.

48:59.633 --> 49:01.015
It's understandable policy.

49:01.035 --> 49:02.797
You have to go to Austin and leave them there.

49:02.937 --> 49:03.178
Yes.

49:03.458 --> 49:04.219
No penance.

49:04.299 --> 49:06.983
Anybody would be pleased to go to Austin and leave them there.

49:07.317 --> 49:10.895
Er, any scholar should be delighted to go to Austen and read them round.

49:10.915 --> 49:14.492
But Michael Holloway had to spend a lot of time there, for sure.

49:14.624 --> 49:15.665
With what?

49:15.705 --> 49:16.787
When he was going through a shock.

49:16.987 --> 49:20.091
Yes, but why a better penance to spend a lot of time in Austin?

49:20.111 --> 49:24.656
Well, why couldn't he go and Xerox the lot, pay for the Xerox and bring him back home?

49:24.676 --> 49:27.159
Why do you have to spend two weeks there reading this stuff?

49:27.179 --> 49:35.329
Well, yes, I'm familiar with the argument, but I don't think, my heart doesn't beat for scholars who find it necessary to spend some time in Texas.

49:35.409 --> 49:36.410
I think it's a lovely state.

49:36.450 --> 49:37.451
I loved it.

49:37.531 --> 49:39.073
My wife and I were there for five days.

49:39.213 --> 49:40.615
It was a good visit.

49:40.595 --> 49:41.917
We sprayed.

49:42.237 --> 49:45.121
Again, let's go back to... Tell me, by the way, when I have to go.

49:45.401 --> 49:48.165
No, I won't tell you if you have to go.

49:48.426 --> 49:49.046
It's okay.

49:49.367 --> 49:55.235
If my friend rings up, I'll... It's only gardening.

49:56.436 --> 50:03.506
We were talking about the development of Colin Franklin's bookseller, collector.

50:03.686 --> 50:04.948
Did you become disenchanted?

50:05.008 --> 50:08.813
I'm told that you left publishing and never looked back at the quote.

50:09.974 --> 50:15.639
Publishing, the reason why I left publishing was really that there was a lot of committees.

50:17.120 --> 50:18.041
I don't like committees.

50:18.101 --> 50:19.402
I'm no good on committees.

50:21.524 --> 50:24.807
I thought it was a great waste of time, of my time.

50:24.847 --> 50:31.073
I don't mean my time to be so wonderfully spent in other ways, but I'm not meaning I was a precious person.

50:31.133 --> 50:33.275
I was just empty afternoons, empty mornings.

50:33.315 --> 50:39.981
I think it's probably still true that men, mostly men, go off to work and from

50:40.265 --> 50:52.077
nine to five or whatever it is, they've come back saying they've had a busy day, supper ready, and really they haven't had a busy day at all, they've had a long sleepy lunch, and they've had three committees which needn't have taken place, and that's the busy day.

50:52.617 --> 50:55.020
And committees are an enormous waste of life.

50:55.080 --> 51:03.668
Well, publishing was becoming more managerial, there was more argument about getting a book through that one likes, I tend to cut out on that and spend more time in the bookshops.

51:04.589 --> 51:09.394
And then one winter afternoon,

51:10.184 --> 51:15.651
In a long committee, I decided that perhaps one only lives once and not for this.

51:15.731 --> 51:22.079
I mean, I've told this story, it's really my own story, so I'll probably write it about one day.

51:22.660 --> 51:31.872
And resigned that afternoon, not in committee, but on my way home to my cousin, who was the chairman, I was vice-chairman.

51:32.459 --> 51:37.547
And I said, I thought of a good way where I could just economize.

51:37.667 --> 51:38.829
And he was immediately interested.

51:38.849 --> 51:40.371
And I said, they can economize on me.

51:41.353 --> 51:44.598
And people were very nice about it.

51:44.618 --> 51:48.203
And thought I was probably having a nervous breakdown, which I wasn't.

51:48.223 --> 51:50.928
And a moment of complete sanity, I think.

51:51.168 --> 51:58.660
And asked if I wouldn't like to work three days a week or take six months off or something.

51:58.680 --> 52:00.222
I said, but I don't make a complete break.

52:00.809 --> 52:05.934
So I arranged, I have to say in January, I arranged to resign in 1970, January 1970.

52:06.735 --> 52:09.598
Resign in September, I thought, to give me time.

52:10.920 --> 52:15.564
And before breakfasts, breakfasts of those nine months, I was writing my first catalogue.

52:17.146 --> 52:17.667
That's great.

52:17.687 --> 52:19.569
And was this, were you cataloguing your own?

52:20.089 --> 52:20.349
Yes.

52:20.510 --> 52:22.211
Tell me about that.

52:22.231 --> 52:25.375
You had acquired things for yourself.

52:25.415 --> 52:25.855
Yes.

52:26.376 --> 52:27.677
How does one then make

52:27.826 --> 52:28.647
the next step?

52:28.667 --> 52:30.950
Well, I decided to be a bookseller.

52:30.970 --> 52:41.303
One big thing is that if you, you know, the emotional phrase people always use is how can you bear to part with things?

52:41.383 --> 52:50.835
Well, it can apply to the sad widow who has to part with things for part of their lives.

52:51.876 --> 52:56.382
But a bookseller parting with something is on the whole very pleased and jolly about it because

52:56.733 --> 53:00.516
It gives them some money to buy something more, and buying is the greatest fun, everybody would agree.

53:00.836 --> 53:01.577
You'd agree with that?

53:01.597 --> 53:01.857
Yes.

53:01.917 --> 53:03.279
So the acquisition is the kick.

53:03.679 --> 53:04.820
The acquisition is the kick.

53:06.281 --> 53:09.724
And selling is a lesser kick because it allows you to acquire.

53:11.025 --> 53:20.393
But if you make a tidy profit, that must validate your judgment and the... Yes, I mean, there are various things.

53:20.413 --> 53:22.215
It validates your judgment, that's quite true.

53:22.335 --> 53:23.616
It justifies your taste.

53:23.836 --> 53:26.318
It's a...

53:26.551 --> 53:29.476
an identity of taste, all that, so that's pleasant.

53:30.017 --> 53:31.600
Relationships should be pleasant.

53:33.363 --> 53:35.407
You go out and look for the night.

53:37.290 --> 53:49.171
So you really acquire, and then people, you've built up a clientele, I gather, and we just stopped.

53:49.191 --> 53:50.854
I knew that was about to happen.
