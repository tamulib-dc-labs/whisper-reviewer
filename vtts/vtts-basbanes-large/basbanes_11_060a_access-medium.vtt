WEBVTT

00:05.279 --> 00:11.647
Could you give us your full name and how you'd like to see it printed?

00:12.347 --> 00:14.970
My name is Edward Maggs, usually known as Ed.

00:14.990 --> 00:17.053
Do you use a little initial?

00:18.374 --> 00:18.434
No.

00:18.455 --> 00:21.678
And what's your formal position in that company?

00:21.698 --> 00:26.264
I am in fact the managing director of Maggs Brothers, and I also run the modern literature department.

00:26.624 --> 00:27.005
I see.

00:27.505 --> 00:33.312
And you represent the fifth generation, is that correct?

00:33.747 --> 01:02.573
I moved here in 1936 and started by a firm starting early 1850s by a man called Uriah Maggs who left his hometown of Midsummer Norton in Somerset where there's a great clutch of people with the name Maggs and came to London and set up a very modest bookshop

01:03.143 --> 01:16.724
very close to Paddington Station, which reminds me of the way the Pakistanis cluster around Heathrow and the way the East End Jews and the Chinese clustered around the docks and clearly he didn't get very far from the force of arrival.

01:16.744 --> 01:16.945
Excuse me.

01:20.410 --> 01:20.470
Hi.

01:20.490 --> 01:20.751
Okay.

01:21.171 --> 01:28.122
And he set up a sort of general stationery and bookshop and then his sons

01:28.692 --> 01:40.553
in the, I suppose, 1880s and 1890s when the rare book trade in London was really beginning to accelerate with the growth of American collectors and the gradual dispersal of the European libraries.

01:42.196 --> 01:45.843
The firm really just sort of grew from there.

01:45.923 --> 01:48.287
That was the beginnings of the modern rare book trade, I think.

01:49.094 --> 01:53.800
You mentioned the dispersal of the libraries to the United States collections.

01:54.180 --> 02:03.712
Well, this was the great trend of the period, I suppose, from the late 19th century through to, I suppose, the 60s and 70s.

02:03.732 --> 02:06.655
It's only in the last 20 years that the trend's been reversed.

02:07.736 --> 02:12.442
I would think that Europe have probably met importers of books from the States now.

02:12.462 --> 02:16.587
Certainly at times in the last few years, Europe has been.

02:18.136 --> 02:24.963
which is the great sales, the great book sales of the last 10 years have been in the States rather than here.

02:25.343 --> 02:28.486
But have you noticed that there is this kind of swing back?

02:29.467 --> 02:31.009
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:31.029 --> 02:36.875
I mean, just that so many books are in the States now that, yeah, it can be a very good place to buy.

02:37.555 --> 02:45.223
Did you find also that some of the more important collectors are over on this side of the Atlantic now as opposed to the...

02:47.178 --> 02:56.211
We've never done a proper sort of geological analysis of our sales, but America must remain our biggest market.

02:57.833 --> 02:58.915
Yeah.

02:58.935 --> 03:07.708
And we'd probably go America, the rest of Europe, and Japan.

03:07.728 --> 03:14.738
But you get, it's very difficult to generalise because you get massive distortions that we only have.

03:15.393 --> 03:22.922
a handful of South American collectors, but they happen to be very, very big collectors and spend a lot of money.

03:24.023 --> 03:26.506
So that would distort the figures.

03:26.526 --> 03:30.070
What kinds of things did the South Americans collect, for instance?

03:30.470 --> 03:32.893
Oh, yeah, various individual types.

03:33.013 --> 03:35.175
It doesn't matter where an individual might be.

03:35.195 --> 03:37.878
There might be a very strong interest in... That's right.

03:37.898 --> 03:39.721
I mean, it's very international.

03:40.161 --> 03:42.784
And we're dealing with people of culture here and education.

03:43.203 --> 03:49.470
And for the most part, culture is an international thing.

03:49.630 --> 03:55.916
Shakespeare is important to an Argentinian, as he is to an Englishman.

03:55.936 --> 03:59.440
And the second largest collection of Shakespeare is in Tokyo, isn't it?

03:59.460 --> 04:01.222
Yeah, that's right.

04:01.282 --> 04:02.663
He just recently died, I guess.

04:02.884 --> 04:04.425
He did, yeah.

04:04.605 --> 04:06.027
Was he a customer here?

04:06.047 --> 04:08.329
No, never bought directly from us, no.

04:08.449 --> 04:11.893
He was, I mean, he only bought pretty much only through the Japanese trade.

04:12.430 --> 04:29.940
It's beginning to open up a little bit and we find ourselves dealing more and more with Japanese people privately and Japanese institutions directly.

04:30.681 --> 04:35.569
So the sort of stranglehold that the Japanese trade's had over it is beginning to

04:41.067 --> 04:43.109
Is the building haunted, by the way?

04:43.129 --> 04:44.230
No.

04:44.790 --> 04:45.050
No.

04:46.592 --> 04:48.974
But that's an enduring story.

04:49.194 --> 04:49.874
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:49.934 --> 04:51.816
And here includes the stories.

04:51.836 --> 04:56.980
There's about three or four different stories about it, none of which support each other.

04:59.002 --> 05:04.987
Just before I put on the tape recording, you had started to talk about something that sounded very interesting.

05:05.007 --> 05:09.051
You were talking about how you gauge interest.

05:09.071 --> 05:10.652
I don't know precisely what you're

05:11.206 --> 05:19.158
developing collections to suit the whatever might be attached in terms of literary importance.

05:19.378 --> 05:38.966
Well, I think when you talk about a bookseller developing collections, I don't think that many... It's very arguable how much we are a mouthpiece of a more general market and how much the activities of the book trade in general influence the market.

05:39.367 --> 05:40.048
I mean, I don't...

05:40.602 --> 05:46.608
I can't think of many customers who I directly advise, who I say, you should buy this.

05:47.049 --> 05:49.511
This is a very good area to collect.

05:49.611 --> 05:52.214
For the most part, I respond to customers.

05:52.774 --> 06:00.662
And there are very few booksellers, I think, who could be set to really actively influence trends themselves.

06:01.243 --> 06:05.327
So when I mentioned earlier about the relationship of literary fashion and collecting fashion,

06:05.645 --> 06:15.978
It's really more in a way of interesting observations, seeing, if you look at the way a TV series or movie will affect the market, it's nowhere near as simple as you would think.

06:16.538 --> 06:20.083
When Brideshead Revisited was a big hit on the TV.

06:20.303 --> 06:25.710
There was no appreciable increase at that time in demand for Evelyn Wall, and Brideshead in particular.

06:25.730 --> 06:27.552
That took two or three years to come through.

06:28.055 --> 06:39.685
And we, in fact, saw the rogue in the rare book market, Enthusiasm for Jane Austen, was evident many years before the recent rash of movies and TV stuff.

06:39.705 --> 06:49.854
And she's now played for the month in the film and telly trade, whereas, in fact, they've been the easiest books in the world to sell for the last ten years or more.

06:50.554 --> 06:51.595
Extraordinary demand.

06:51.775 --> 06:57.100
And so it may well be that the movie Enthusiasm is a reflection of a

06:57.518 --> 07:01.021
you know, a proper literary enthusiasm.

07:01.041 --> 07:08.667
I think we're experiencing the same thing on our side with Melissa Mayelfatt, you know, this is a tremendous research into the book.

07:08.687 --> 07:09.828
Really?

07:11.410 --> 07:13.351
And that's expressed in modern editions of books?

07:13.612 --> 07:15.994
Absolutely, yeah.

07:16.274 --> 07:21.618
And they found some of these old pseudonymous things that she wrote.

07:21.678 --> 07:23.020
Oh, yeah.

07:23.100 --> 07:27.103
They enjoyed a pretty good popularity.

07:28.096 --> 07:34.626
but I think it's been fueled in part by, you know, tremendous interest on television.

07:34.646 --> 07:38.653
But how much of your business would you say is wide and stuff?

07:38.673 --> 07:40.476
20th century modern?

07:40.496 --> 07:48.628
Well, in the terms of the whole business.

07:48.648 --> 07:50.692
About 10%, something like that.

07:50.992 --> 07:54.778
So the principal area continues to be

07:55.315 --> 07:57.337
Well, what are our principal areas?

07:58.299 --> 08:13.537
The travel books, incunabula, medieval manuscripts, early English literature, natural history books, military history, bibliography, and autographs and manuscripts in general.

08:14.819 --> 08:22.268
The thing you've got to realise about the modern book trade, I mean the trade of modern books, is that in my area, 19th and 20th century English literature,

08:22.535 --> 08:26.620
the number of books which are inherently worth more than, let's say, £5,000, very few.

08:26.920 --> 08:29.183
I mean, you know, a dozen, a couple of dozen.

08:29.623 --> 08:33.868
We're not talking about special copies of books, but books which inherently are that expensive.

08:34.669 --> 08:49.485
Whereas if you look at an area like colour plate books, or important travel books, or Incunabula, there are many more expensive books, which is why the modern books is a relatively small part of all business.

08:50.046 --> 08:51.748
Do you do much with...

08:52.066 --> 08:56.971
institutional libraries for collection development?

08:57.251 --> 09:05.519
Our firm for the longest time has tended to be, to concentrate more on the private collector rather than the institutional collector.

09:05.560 --> 09:13.087
We've got good relations with many institutions and work with them and do business with them, but the main thrust is probably the private person.

09:13.467 --> 09:20.014
Again, this notion of collection development is something which

09:20.399 --> 09:34.419
Some dealers do manage to work closely enough with collectors and institutions that they will, in fact, guide the collection.

09:34.439 --> 09:37.203
But that's unusual, that's very rare.

09:38.204 --> 09:47.858
But for the most part, it's a much more demand-led sort of situation, where most librarians know exactly what they want,

09:48.175 --> 09:51.278
and know exactly why they're buying it, and they come to you to find it.

09:51.838 --> 10:11.076
And that it's exceptional for a bookseller to actually be guiding the development of the collection.

10:11.797 --> 10:12.277
Not really.

10:12.297 --> 10:13.238
Not really.

10:13.258 --> 10:15.280
No, I mean, if...

10:16.677 --> 10:34.467
Again, without being specific, for the most part, people... I know dealers who have much closer relationships with their customers than the relationship you just mentioned, even.

10:34.767 --> 10:39.832
But even then, it's very difficult telling someone you're going to buy this.

10:39.892 --> 10:42.956
The enthusiasm comes from the customer first.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.157
That's very important.

10:44.838 --> 10:51.605
If you look at the great relationship, the great customer-dealer relationship was probably Ian Fleming and Percy Muir.

10:51.805 --> 10:53.026
Which I write about in my book.

10:53.046 --> 10:54.828
The whole thing in the mind of man thing.

10:55.068 --> 10:57.050
And then again, the idea came from Fleming.

10:57.871 --> 11:03.878
And it was his enthusiasm for it and his understanding of it that made it all work.

11:03.898 --> 11:04.318
That's right.

11:04.940 --> 11:17.072
No, just because Percy knew the book trade and was such a widely developed and intelligent person, he was able to interpret that well and helped him build it.

11:17.152 --> 11:29.985
But I think what I said earlier, I am trying to put a sharper focus on the authority, the scholars, the people who really do understand collections as collections,

11:30.168 --> 11:41.484
and how the bookseller, and the relationship you just mentioned, the viewer and the Fleming viewers, and how it did work to a very, you know, to create a marvelous, marvelous collection.

11:41.524 --> 11:41.965
Yeah.

11:41.985 --> 11:43.327
Indiana University, to that extent.

11:43.347 --> 11:54.302
Well, that's right, and sort of, you know, probably signaled a sea change in collecting, but, you know, it was such a big landmark that it clearly did sort of influence tastes.

11:54.683 --> 11:56.445
Can you think of any other...

11:57.573 --> 12:06.443
Collections like that, they're not necessarily even in this building, but where there is that kind of a symbiotic relationship, where the bookseller does work.

12:06.743 --> 12:07.904
Can you talk to Steve Weissman?

12:08.585 --> 12:25.504
We'll make sure we talk to him about his poetry collector, his name I've forgotten, which is... That's one where, from what we'll understand, Steve's basically on a retainer.

12:25.822 --> 12:29.307
I want to spend X thousand dollars a year and want to make the best collection of poetry I can.

12:31.369 --> 12:33.332
They are the exception, those sort of collections.

12:33.913 --> 12:35.335
I mean, am I right, John?

12:35.415 --> 12:40.461
Or am I just reflecting my own lack of enterprise and success at guiding people?

12:41.743 --> 12:54.580
Talking about how often this whole idea of collection development and the idea of the books that are being given a remit by a collector or institution to, you know,

12:55.117 --> 13:05.268
go out and do it for me.

13:05.848 --> 13:09.132
It's very rare now, isn't it?

13:09.152 --> 13:09.752
Well, in my experience, it is.

13:09.773 --> 13:24.448
I think it may, for a bit, for a bit, for a bit, for a bit, for a bit, for a bit, for a bit, for a bit, for a bit, for a bit, for a bit, for a bit, for a bit, for a bit, for a bit, for a bit, for a bit, for a bit, for a bit, for a bit, for a bit, for a bit, for a bit, for a bit,

13:25.390 --> 13:28.595
I don't even know if we picked that up.

13:28.635 --> 13:33.962
That sounded pretty interesting.

13:34.002 --> 13:39.490
Who is this gentleman?

13:39.791 --> 13:43.897
Okay, bye.

13:43.997 --> 13:50.346
Well, he's a great old seller.

13:50.566 --> 13:51.948
He really is.

13:52.069 --> 13:55.093
Interesting how he moved his operation here, isn't it?

13:55.293 --> 14:00.018
Yeah, I mean, he's sort of Slovenian, but I'm sure he'll be successful.

14:00.439 --> 14:11.151
But it's a very rare combination of proper, at least quasi-academic intelligence and education and the sort of entrepreneurial instinct.

14:11.171 --> 14:11.652
Very, very rare.

14:11.672 --> 14:14.115
I mean, it's a perfect combination for a bookseller.

14:14.135 --> 14:17.679
Someone who gambles as well as reads and understands.

14:17.699 --> 14:25.047
There are any number of booksellers who are good salesmen, good dealmakers, but they might as well be selling fridges.

14:25.600 --> 14:33.187
and there are any number of booksellers who are great academically understand the stuff, love it, but couldn't make a deal as it were.

14:35.470 --> 14:51.085
There's a great episode in a film called The Harder They Come, which is set in the reggae music industry in business in Jamaica, and the central character is trying to sell his record to the radio station.

14:51.622 --> 14:57.611
explaining that they've got a tie-in with a big producer and they can't play anything that doesn't come from Mr. Big.

14:58.051 --> 15:01.756
And the great line there is, well, that's show business, no business, no show.

15:01.776 --> 15:13.153
And so it's all very well having a great understanding of the book business, but if you can't actually make a spot and pursue a deal, then that's no use.

15:13.233 --> 15:16.798
And that speaks from a few people who can combine those two.

15:19.502 --> 15:20.363
Do you find that

15:20.731 --> 15:27.480
I was just reading on the flight over this new little book, like, you know, Rostenberg, you're on the .

15:27.501 --> 15:31.266
They've got a 50-year memoir published in June.

15:31.526 --> 15:39.037
And I was charmed by, you know, the great discoveries they may have, you know, .

15:39.057 --> 15:44.104
But maybe this connection, this might have been a little bit built in .

15:44.184 --> 15:48.510
You know, if you find this kind of discovery at all happening

15:48.912 --> 15:50.555
Oh yeah, all the time, all the time.

15:50.575 --> 16:11.811
And I think it's the... If this were to be a hostile interview, and someone were to accuse me, say that all collecting is based on greed, it is retentive accumulation of stuff for its own sake, I'd say that there's no one within it.

16:12.552 --> 16:14.616
However, the...

16:15.288 --> 16:33.195
However much you argue about the fundamentals of collecting, the fact is that sometimes almost incidentally, although for the most part it is deliberate, it is what pertains the staff of culture, and it's one of the most important cultural expressions.

16:34.296 --> 16:42.088
The fact that people like owning things, the fact that people look after things, often just for the sake of looking after them,

16:42.524 --> 17:08.903
means that they get preserved and we've often found important books which have been looked after well by people who've got no idea of what they are and have looked after it because one looks after things and because they like having things around them and it's that almost accidental preservation of culture which book collecting can do that

17:10.047 --> 17:15.814
Accidental or incidental?

17:15.894 --> 17:23.743
Well, books are wonderfully passive things, and you can ignore a book for several hundred years.

17:23.943 --> 17:29.930
I mean, many books haven't been read for several hundred years, and yet the book still has this power to change your life.

17:30.030 --> 17:31.652
All you've got to do is open it, and it's there.

17:31.772 --> 17:34.255
They're the most undemonstrative of objects.

17:34.275 --> 17:37.398
A painting is there, and it sort of shouts itself or whispers itself.

17:37.418 --> 17:38.940
It's visible.

17:39.190 --> 17:46.762
You can't sort of avoid it when it's playing, but we'll just sit there and be quite happy being ignored for a hundred years or more.

17:48.144 --> 17:49.507
It's like an unarmed weapon.

17:49.527 --> 17:53.894
As soon as you open it, it's armed, and then it's got a plan to change your life.

17:53.914 --> 18:05.873
Do you find that, you mentioned 700 years, of course, our history in the United States doesn't even approach that, but do you find, and of course that's quite a large figure, do you find families in the States

18:06.545 --> 18:09.509
Where books have been preserved, incidentally.

18:09.669 --> 18:10.010
Oh, yeah.

18:11.051 --> 18:11.892
And then what happens?

18:11.932 --> 18:15.297
Do they decide at some point, well, maybe it's time to give them a new life?

18:15.317 --> 18:18.622
How is it that they come into your worldview?

18:18.642 --> 18:21.205
Well, it's a question of generations, isn't it?

18:21.225 --> 18:26.012
And the sort of old cliché is that, you know, it clogs the clogs in three generations.

18:26.052 --> 18:29.937
And often it's the first generation that makes the money, the second generation spends the money.

18:30.187 --> 18:33.171
and the third generation lives on what the second generation bought.

18:34.172 --> 18:36.616
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

18:36.696 --> 18:43.425
And so it's often the... Often collections are kept together sentimentally by the children of the collectors.

18:43.906 --> 18:50.134
By the time it gets down to grandchildren, usually there's not much direct connection and they will sell.

18:51.776 --> 18:59.046
You can't often find children who will almost religiously maintain a collection that their parents did, as a memorial to them.

18:59.245 --> 19:03.650
without really knowing what the collection is, probably, sometimes?

19:03.770 --> 19:06.914
Without knowing the intensity that the person who made the collection did.

19:07.054 --> 19:18.366
It's a much more passive relationship, and a proper collection is a growing thing, and once the collection stops and is complete, that's what goes back.

19:19.127 --> 19:26.215
Never did library catalogues discuss this, because as soon as the catalogues finished and printed, that's it, end of collection, no more buying.

19:26.836 --> 19:34.588
Do you find that the sources generally do come from private?

19:36.491 --> 19:41.379
Directly, it's a small percentage.

19:42.240 --> 19:51.274
Indirectly, most of it is the deaccessioning trend is going to increase over the years.

19:51.541 --> 19:54.586
Yeah, it's balanced.

19:54.767 --> 19:56.610
It's basically balanced, isn't it?

19:56.850 --> 20:11.856
Because so much of it is rather redundant or duplicated or just unused that just by the law of economics and sort of ebb and flow of things, they will begin to come out.

20:12.117 --> 20:12.918
I mean, as they are.

20:13.339 --> 20:17.025
There have been many high profiles.

20:17.242 --> 20:20.947
deaccessions and much more than what's going on at the time.

20:20.967 --> 20:26.835
I think this is... I missed that while the... The panel, yeah, but we're used to... The key sentence.

20:26.895 --> 20:29.118
Were you talking about deaccessions from institutions?

20:29.619 --> 20:29.979
Yeah, yeah.

20:29.999 --> 20:33.604
So that is happening here with some greater frequency?

20:33.624 --> 20:35.066
Well, yeah, yeah, everywhere.

20:35.166 --> 20:37.069
I think here and in the States.

20:37.089 --> 20:37.910
It's happening.

20:37.970 --> 20:40.293
We're looking at this in the States.

20:40.313 --> 20:41.154
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:42.156 --> 20:46.101
It's something which is often very badly handled because of the embarrassment of the Liberians

20:46.705 --> 20:50.209
of overselling requests and things.

20:50.369 --> 20:51.470
That's what's often.

20:52.211 --> 20:53.733
Can you think of any examples here?

20:54.033 --> 20:58.858
Notable examples where there's been accession?

20:58.878 --> 21:02.462
I don't think the British Library has any accession.

21:02.702 --> 21:05.766
No, not meaningfully.

21:13.274 --> 21:16.037
Are you finding that the institution just

21:17.468 --> 21:26.737
are doing more computerized stuff, but they're casting a sharper eye towards... Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

21:29.200 --> 21:34.405
And we're finding an attitude that, in many cases, who reads books?

21:34.425 --> 21:35.245
Who reads printed books?

21:35.265 --> 21:36.487
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

21:36.607 --> 21:37.548
Are you running into that?

21:37.588 --> 21:40.290
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:40.310 --> 21:41.351
People telling you that.

21:41.371 --> 21:42.453
Yeah, yeah.

21:42.473 --> 21:47.037
I mean, this is something which affects the world of...

21:48.130 --> 21:54.760
The reference book, much more than the world of the rare book, the collector's book, the sort of cultural icon.

21:55.341 --> 21:56.764
I mean, books are bought for two reasons.

21:56.784 --> 21:59.608
One is for the information, and the other one is the cultural icon.

21:59.648 --> 22:12.388
You've already got a paperback of Ulysses, but you actually want the real thing, because it's an atmospheric symbol of the way the book was published, and it's an important relic.

22:12.649 --> 22:13.530
It's a cultural relic.

22:14.152 --> 22:21.824
And I'm sure the market in books for information rather than books as objects of inspiration is changing.

22:21.844 --> 22:41.695
You've only got to look at the market in academic reprints, academic journals and things, which has been sort of more or less destroyed, first of all by a piece and now by sort of CD-ROMs, and then by the internet, to realize that the electronic medium is now the medium of choice, those sort of things.

22:41.962 --> 22:43.804
And that doesn't bother me at all.

22:43.844 --> 22:47.067
I mean, we're much happier using book auction records on CD-ROM.

22:47.548 --> 23:00.501
I'm happier calling into the British Library to consult their catalogue over the internet than I am having to trundle downstairs using this absurd micro-print edition and you never really know where to look for something or where to bounce about in it.

23:01.022 --> 23:05.747
And so the replacement of the reference book by electronic media I think is great.

23:06.547 --> 23:10.011
But the OED, for instance, absolutely belongs on

23:10.582 --> 23:12.706
the DMV, all these things.

23:12.786 --> 23:16.172
I mean, they are sort of unambiguously good.

23:16.192 --> 23:25.808
I was thinking the other day about, just last night in fact, talking to someone about the positive things that have come out of the information revolution, as it were, and the negative things.

23:26.209 --> 23:28.152
We've got too much information.

23:28.486 --> 23:38.016
increase the pressure on people individually, but the unambiguously positive things are the kind of better access, better communication, better access to reference books.

23:38.256 --> 23:41.920
Well, the question is, what's the difference between information and knowledge?

23:42.140 --> 23:47.506
Information really doesn't, it's data.

23:47.526 --> 23:49.108
Zero within one.

23:50.529 --> 23:55.995
But you have found that some institutions are calling you and saying, you know,

23:56.093 --> 24:20.683
No, because that's not particularly delting, you see, the sort of, the reference book, the... Yeah, it's at the collector's end of the market where we are dealing as much with

24:20.849 --> 24:30.263
what you might call the cultural relic, the cultural icon, as much as with the text of the theme.

24:30.644 --> 24:47.970
We are not at all worried about the relative, the partial redundancy of the printed page which is happening because it only reinforces the beauty and wonder of the book and the more

24:48.440 --> 24:57.876
people spend their days reading things on computer screens, the more they want to read a proper book on the way home, and the more they realise the inherent qualities of the book.

24:57.896 --> 25:04.166
Also, incidentally, the more antique the notion of the book becomes, it's quite likely the more collectible it will become.

25:04.607 --> 25:10.016
Do you find any interest in rare books as long as it's ever been?

25:10.036 --> 25:11.318
I think so, yeah.

25:11.338 --> 25:11.779
I think so.

25:11.979 --> 25:14.143
I mean, no two booksellers would agree.

25:14.343 --> 25:31.930
And half the booksellers will complain about a complaint that all their collectors are getting old, there aren't any young collectors involved in it, that it's a dying pursuit.

25:32.130 --> 25:36.537
And then other people, myself included, my best customers,

25:37.900 --> 25:42.606
what is young obviously changes as you grow older.

25:42.626 --> 25:46.151
You say most of your collectors are younger?

25:46.171 --> 25:52.299
My best collectors, I can't think of many of them who are much over 50.

25:52.920 --> 26:00.270
Certainly not old people, certainly not by today's standards.

26:00.290 --> 26:04.195
If you're busy making your fortune in the 30s, you haven't got the money to spend it on.

26:04.495 --> 26:06.198
on the organization.

26:06.218 --> 26:08.000
Secondly, you put it in at the time.

26:08.681 --> 26:16.373
So there's an element of it being a pursuit which gets a certain amount of time and a certain amount of money to pursue.

26:16.393 --> 26:21.060
At least collectors who generally start with you, or do they more or less live up to you?

26:21.720 --> 26:24.525
Whenever I try and generalize about that, I always end up talking completely.

26:24.545 --> 26:30.874
But you must have a sense of, you know, a novice collector or somebody with less terminology.

26:34.111 --> 26:40.278
Yeah, we like to think that we can, you know, because we don't just carry expensive books, we carry, you know, novice books as well.

26:40.599 --> 26:53.313
We like to think that we can sell books to the novice and the tyro, and explain the internet from the beginning.

26:53.754 --> 27:03.325
And it's often, as I heard Manning yesterday, obviously only really just, was just beginning to get interested in sort of, you know, collecting books as objects.

27:03.777 --> 27:09.725
the sense of enthusiasm and the genuine affection for these things.

27:09.745 --> 27:12.349
It was a great pleasure showing him around the store.

27:12.949 --> 27:15.793
And I'm talking about the ins and outs of it.

27:15.973 --> 27:20.660
It didn't bother me at all that he didn't buy anything.

27:20.680 --> 27:22.382
You mentioned that you have modest books.

27:22.402 --> 27:23.764
Could you give me a sense of your range?

27:24.665 --> 27:29.451
Oh, pound zero to, you know, a couple of million.

27:31.154 --> 27:32.856
Give me an example of a couple of million.

27:33.511 --> 27:43.581
Well, we can sell you a collection of books on the Gulf now for, I think it's about two or three million pounds.

27:43.902 --> 27:50.809
On the Middle East, which is worth a couple of million, we think.

27:50.829 --> 27:53.151
I just sold an archive this week for 100,000.

27:54.593 --> 28:02.421
We, you know, many colour plate books are worth, they're really worth five and six figures.

28:03.312 --> 28:08.140
I mean, they've basically sold the private collection.

28:12.949 --> 28:20.401
The examples I just mentioned, in fact, the collection of books on the Middle East and the archive.

28:20.461 --> 28:24.288
The archive which is sold has gone to an institution, which is the main market for archives.

28:25.009 --> 28:29.016
And the Middle East collection hasn't been sold in its life yet.

28:29.333 --> 28:30.756
to go to an institution.

28:30.916 --> 28:38.090
It would be the core of a very useful, small university library.

28:39.031 --> 28:44.602
In the United States, we still have new institutions being established as we speak.

28:44.883 --> 28:51.375
There's an institution out in California, Monterey, opened up within the last five years.

28:51.659 --> 28:54.482
They didn't even have a library in the plants.

28:54.542 --> 28:56.164
Did you hear about this?

28:56.344 --> 28:56.925
No, really.

28:56.945 --> 29:00.989
They got a lot of criticism, so they thought, all right, we'll have a library.

29:01.009 --> 29:06.895
The whole press, the whole intention was to have an electronic resource.

29:06.915 --> 29:08.557
What name was the press?

29:08.677 --> 29:11.280
It was part of the California State System.

29:11.480 --> 29:17.626
It was in Monterey at the former Fort Worth.

29:17.847 --> 29:20.029
California State University of Monterey campus, I guess.

29:20.363 --> 29:29.732
But then on the other hand, you'll find some new institutions that are opening, and they need books desperately.

29:29.832 --> 29:33.315
I was talking to one bookseller, he's brought in 80,000 books.

29:33.375 --> 29:34.416
They just want books.

29:35.217 --> 29:41.883
It is almost paradoxical on the one hand when you see institutions, the accessioning books.

29:41.903 --> 29:46.928
The measure of a great institution, on the other hand, is how many books do you have?

29:47.228 --> 29:47.608
Yeah.

29:47.729 --> 29:52.414
You know, my friend Gregoria was leaving Brown to go to the Carnegie Corporation.

29:52.434 --> 29:54.076
I just didn't even know him last week.

29:54.096 --> 30:02.505
You know, one of his great triumphs over the last nine years is to have increased the Brown collections from two million to three million books in nine years.

30:02.665 --> 30:02.966
Yeah.

30:03.146 --> 30:05.449
And then we got some other decisions where we've got water go down.

30:05.469 --> 30:07.992
I want to now leave in six million, let's say.

30:08.272 --> 30:13.998
But do you find that that the badge of respect still is in the number of titles that you have?

30:14.999 --> 30:15.480
About 12.

30:16.675 --> 30:22.962
I mean numbers are meaningless.

30:22.982 --> 30:28.488
You want to buy a million books, I'll get you a million books.

30:29.229 --> 30:33.374
It won't cost you a million dollars even.

30:36.978 --> 30:40.101
The book is such a powerful object and people

30:40.604 --> 30:43.627
It still is a mighty thing.

30:43.767 --> 30:48.912
And so the idea of X million books is, I suppose, a great landmarks.

30:48.932 --> 31:02.405
It helps publicize the institution, but most of our institutional customers are much more concerned with the quality of what they've got and the educational value.

31:02.425 --> 31:10.172
Can you think of any, again, to go back to what I mentioned earlier, how this book really does hope to give some sense

31:10.540 --> 31:11.922
of continental collecting.

31:11.942 --> 31:14.927
Can you think of some collectors?

31:16.450 --> 31:20.356
We've got problems of confidentiality here.

31:20.617 --> 31:22.079
I understand.

31:22.179 --> 31:26.046
And to cut to a question five or ten minutes further on.

31:26.386 --> 31:28.109
We'll turn the thing off if you want.

31:28.910 --> 31:36.683
The big difference, the psychological difference between the picture collector, or the furniture collector, and the book collector is in the nature of the relationship between the object

31:36.663 --> 31:39.428
Stick a picture on the wall, it's one to many.

31:39.769 --> 31:41.773
A piece of furniture there is one to many.

31:42.053 --> 31:43.476
It is a public statement of stuff.

31:43.697 --> 31:45.580
A book is an essentially private thing.

31:45.720 --> 31:47.504
Only one person can do it at a time.

31:47.965 --> 31:51.171
They can read it at a time, for the most part.

31:51.672 --> 31:53.355
And this is...

31:53.335 --> 32:05.714
This is why booksellers are always seduced by the idea of exhibiting in antique fairs and selling into the picture market because they know what good valued books are, you know, as cultural objects.

32:05.734 --> 32:07.277
They're far better valued than paintings.

32:07.897 --> 32:12.625
But over and over again you realise that it doesn't work, that this great arbitrage really isn't there.

32:13.005 --> 32:18.193
And the psychological motivation behind collecting paintings and behind collecting books can be completely different.

32:18.213 --> 32:19.275
I mean, it's worlds apart.

32:19.711 --> 32:30.025
And almost every book collector will tell you about the disappointment he felt in the early stages of his collection when he realised that none of his friends and colleagues

32:30.224 --> 32:32.106
had a clue what he was talking about.

32:32.727 --> 32:38.014
And you describe to them some wonderful book you just bought, and you see their eyes glaze over straight away.

32:38.034 --> 32:50.791
Whereas you show them your Rembrandt or your Van Gogh, and they may be completely colorblind and visually illiterate, but they know that it cost you five million dollars.

32:51.211 --> 32:59.522
Well, again, without being specific, one thing I do want to try and illustrate is, remember, if you know this book,

32:59.873 --> 33:08.464
is the significance of the great private library at this particular point in history at this time.

33:08.484 --> 33:10.927
And what a wonderful opportunity it would be.

33:11.268 --> 33:23.704
And this is a totally positive, forward-looking, and how it's, you know, the work of a man like Mr. Gaines's stature, who has a perception and an interest

33:23.937 --> 33:30.267
to build this, working with this firm to see it happen, and look what you have.

33:30.287 --> 33:32.690
We'll be there, you know.

33:32.710 --> 33:34.413
Absolutely.

33:34.433 --> 33:36.476
And that's basically .

33:36.576 --> 33:38.659
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:38.759 --> 33:43.887
And if it's, you know, as we chat out loud, you know, if in fact,

33:44.238 --> 33:47.106
he was misrepresented in this book.

33:47.648 --> 33:49.092
I did this in my other book.

33:49.313 --> 33:55.210
I mean, if- No, he wasn't- When I perceived wrongs to have been done, I was more than happy to.

33:55.510 --> 33:59.415
to set it right in print.

33:59.435 --> 34:09.308
The subtle point there was not that he was misrepresented, but the point I was trying to make with it is not that he doesn't want to talk to you when he spoke to the people about the decorating book.

34:09.328 --> 34:11.912
He didn't know he was speaking to the people about the decorating book.

34:11.932 --> 34:21.805
They were his comments, but they were obtained not exactly by deception, but unknowingly by Brian, as it were.

34:22.105 --> 34:32.979
Well, it is, you know, I mean, all I can do is... I would never, I mean, there's a tape recorder right in front of you, you know, you see it.

34:33.019 --> 34:33.499
Yeah, yeah.

34:33.519 --> 34:37.705
You are transparently and honest, and a sympathetic commentator.

34:38.586 --> 34:44.033
And I... I mean, you know why I'm here.

34:44.053 --> 34:45.755
I mean, I made this survey.

34:45.775 --> 34:48.298
This is...

34:48.481 --> 34:52.487
This is not my call, and it is also not mutable.

34:54.871 --> 35:01.882
So I won't be seeing Brian at all today, is that right?

35:02.102 --> 35:02.623
How about John?

35:02.643 --> 35:07.090
John's back, yeah.

35:07.190 --> 35:08.792
Is there a sixth generation?

35:09.433 --> 35:13.439
I've got a ten-year-old son who's going to be at the moment.

35:14.180 --> 35:16.564
He's not a footballer, ballet dancer or something, I think.

35:16.831 --> 35:18.253
I want to say it's going to be a ballet dancer.

35:18.273 --> 35:21.678
There's a lot of pressure on that tenure when you think about it.

35:21.698 --> 35:37.139
Well, it's only a matter of sort of, not exactly chance, but, you know, can't claim any inherent virtue in having, you know, found this a congenial place to work and wouldn't be at least disappointed if my son didn't find it a congenial place to work.

35:38.340 --> 35:40.604
You know, it's... Ben.

35:41.204 --> 35:42.706
Ben Benjamin?

35:42.726 --> 35:42.847
Yeah.

35:42.867 --> 35:43.487
Do you bring him in?

35:43.948 --> 35:45.370
Yeah, he comes in all the time.

35:45.620 --> 35:46.661
Well, not all the time.

35:46.721 --> 35:48.383
Do you have books in the house?

35:49.104 --> 35:52.027
Oh yes, full of books.

35:52.047 --> 35:57.512
I'm switching the subject entirely now, as you can see.

35:57.613 --> 36:04.580
I'd like to apologise, by the way, for the disappointing year.

36:04.600 --> 36:05.140
Do you have a question?

36:05.160 --> 36:08.904
Oh yeah, he's actually much more the collector than either of his parents.

36:09.165 --> 36:12.488
I mean, books, you know, cards.

36:12.738 --> 36:14.680
little toys and things.

36:15.141 --> 36:16.403
He likes accumulating things.

36:18.465 --> 36:20.428
And he gets mad with me when I sell things.

36:20.768 --> 36:21.709
Absolutely mad.

36:22.050 --> 36:27.697
Because my hobby, one of the things I most like doing is going around junk shops at the weekends or whenever I can.

36:27.717 --> 36:29.559
It's the greatest of pressures.

36:29.879 --> 36:34.345
It's like fishing, continual renewal of hope over experience.

36:35.086 --> 36:35.927
Do you ever fish?

36:36.278 --> 36:57.325
the fisherman knows only too well the feeling of having done a blank day and very disappointing but you know that next week your hope will triumph over your experience and you will be there and as you go down you will have visions you anything can happen you know in the world record

36:58.047 --> 36:58.808
Big fish!

36:59.249 --> 37:03.855
And it's exactly the same thrill that comes from hunting for stuff.

37:03.875 --> 37:12.627
So when I buy stuff at the weekends, and if I find something good, and then decide to sell it, he gives me terrible grief.

37:12.688 --> 37:16.453
I'm afraid he's a proper collector accumulator, won't let us get rid of anything.

37:16.533 --> 37:21.560
So I have to do it on the side, and then six miles later he'll say, damn, where's that?

37:21.580 --> 37:22.321
I've sold it, son.

37:22.661 --> 37:23.042
How come you...

37:23.866 --> 37:26.850
At what point did you, how old did you start?

37:26.890 --> 37:28.032
I'm 38 I think.

37:30.935 --> 37:37.825
So did you train or educate yourself with the idea that you'd enter there?

37:37.845 --> 37:47.157
No, I was pretty much, as an adolescent I didn't much want to do it because it seemed like too soft an option.

37:47.457 --> 37:54.525
And so I tried and failed in various other enterprises and ended up here accidentally.

37:55.406 --> 38:02.194
More or less accidentally, needed a job and sort of helped out in the packing department or something and never left.

38:02.635 --> 38:05.318
And I found it extraordinarily congenial.

38:05.979 --> 38:12.627
It's a wonderful world for the generalist to be in and for people who enjoy meeting people.

38:13.608 --> 38:16.992
People who enjoy meeting people.

38:17.292 --> 38:24.763
The profile of the bookseller is quite interesting.

38:25.203 --> 38:34.997
Very few of them made a conscious decision at the beginning that this was what they wanted to do.

38:35.753 --> 38:43.366
the book collector who needs more and the person who, you know, from a very young age been passionate about books as objects.

38:43.786 --> 38:47.813
But for the most part we'd drift into it from different areas.

38:49.496 --> 38:51.680
Do you own a fashion for the books yourself?

38:51.700 --> 38:53.783
Yeah, at times.

38:53.883 --> 38:59.753
Do you get a feeling, an indefinable, an expressible feeling when you come upon something really exquisite?

38:59.935 --> 39:03.420
Yeah, I get excited.

39:03.520 --> 39:08.707
I love books.

39:10.670 --> 39:19.662
Part of it, it's difficult to disentangle the thrill of acquisition from the inherent virtues of the object.

39:21.264 --> 39:27.613
And also when you're in business, the business side of it clouds the picture even further.

39:27.880 --> 39:29.904
No, they are the most extraordinary objects.

39:31.086 --> 39:35.254
There's no cultural object in the world to match it.

39:35.474 --> 39:44.852
Name it, whatever it is, name a human emotion, name a human activity, you can express that in a book collection.

39:44.972 --> 39:47.997
Or you can help understand it in a book collection.

39:48.679 --> 39:50.462
Love, war, death.

39:50.915 --> 39:57.104
This book will be coming out in two years, so just tell me what the date of your birthday is.

39:57.124 --> 39:58.326
20th November, 58th.

39:58.466 --> 40:04.876
So you'll be 20... You'll probably be 40 on this book.

40:04.896 --> 40:05.156
Yeah.

40:06.838 --> 40:14.029
Can you think of anything you'd like to ask?

40:14.790 --> 40:15.451
Yeah.

40:15.471 --> 40:15.752
Yeah.

40:15.772 --> 40:18.095
Well, they are extraordinary objects.

40:18.395 --> 40:19.437
Could we...

40:19.552 --> 40:22.096
Yeah, yeah, sure.

40:22.116 --> 40:23.639
I'm delighted to.

40:25.081 --> 40:25.502
Interesting.

40:25.622 --> 40:26.343
In the old days?

40:26.964 --> 40:35.699
In the old days, because you were dealing in many more books, the whole way of dealing in books is different.

40:35.719 --> 40:37.522
It's all much more intense.

40:37.542 --> 40:39.525
It's much more exact.

40:40.406 --> 40:45.154
You can't get away with perfecting books.

40:45.505 --> 40:46.446
the way that you used to.

40:46.466 --> 40:56.459
I mean, if you read the version back with Tom Jones, what was the great fielding story, you know, the made-up.

41:00.023 --> 41:03.728
People used to make books up much more in the 1920s and 30s than they do now.

41:04.129 --> 41:05.330
But how does that make them?

41:05.370 --> 41:06.331
No, complete a book.

41:06.512 --> 41:09.375
If you've got a partial book, you take leaves from other copy and stick it in.

41:09.395 --> 41:09.936
Oh, I see.

41:09.996 --> 41:10.737
Okay, I'm sure.

41:11.054 --> 41:30.474
Nowadays people are much keener on the idea of virginity, the whole thrust of, indeed the whole point of book collecting is to get the book in its original condition, in the idea that you will get closer to the state of creation and publication and you will feel more in contact with the time.

41:31.095 --> 41:39.323
And so in the 20s, not only were we dealing with a greater volume of books, but we spent more time

41:39.775 --> 41:43.300
playing around with them, putting leaves in from one copy to another, and so on.

41:43.640 --> 41:49.388
And so every big bookseller would have had a room like this, where they would, you know, you buy a book, even a rare book.

41:49.408 --> 41:50.309
This is very interesting.

41:51.291 --> 41:56.919
I mean, what's this?

41:56.939 --> 42:03.928
It's back in a Mundi 1635, and it lacks the last leaf of the table, and the first leaf of the dedication.

42:04.569 --> 42:08.955
Page three's been repaired, and page five is defective.

42:09.239 --> 42:14.166
Nowadays, this would be perfectly, well, quite stable, as is.

42:14.186 --> 42:26.785
Back then, it wouldn't have been, and so we would have kept it waiting to get a copy which maybe had other defects, from which we could nick the back page.

42:28.047 --> 42:29.389
So this is called the O-D-D-M-E-N-T.

42:29.549 --> 42:30.871
O-D-M-E-N-T.

42:31.132 --> 42:31.973
O-D-M-E-N-T.

42:31.993 --> 42:32.434
O-D-M-E-N-T.

42:33.075 --> 42:33.375
Room.

42:34.156 --> 42:35.398
And this is basically...

42:35.868 --> 42:40.794
This has been accumulating over... These are books which weren't considered... Over the decades.

42:40.814 --> 42:45.059
...of saleable quality, of merchantable quality.

42:45.219 --> 42:53.789
So page 3, 4, 5 is defective on this, otherwise perfectly... These are saleable books, but not of saleable quality.

42:54.770 --> 42:55.250
Is that a fair?

42:55.351 --> 42:58.735
Well, they are... Desirable books, but... Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:58.755 --> 43:00.036
I mean, looking at them, some of them are...

43:00.657 --> 43:09.313
Some of them are books which may at one time have been saleable, but nowadays aren't particularly, because fashions do change.

43:10.175 --> 43:14.182
In other lines of work, this might be called, you know, a place where you keep the spare parts.

43:14.563 --> 43:14.824
Yeah.

43:15.064 --> 43:16.046
Yeah, absolutely so.

43:16.066 --> 43:16.507
Absolutely so.

43:16.547 --> 43:18.911
I mean, like breaking an old Ferrari or something.

43:19.613 --> 43:23.560
And so this was stuck up here for the fame.

43:24.012 --> 43:26.234
Well, this is a very interesting book.

43:26.254 --> 43:26.975
Look at this.

43:27.635 --> 43:29.137
This is what the 7th, 18th century.

43:31.239 --> 43:33.681
Yeah.

43:33.701 --> 43:34.742
That's been cut.

43:34.762 --> 43:35.142
Look at that.

43:36.784 --> 43:37.885
Now, who did that, do you think?

43:38.045 --> 43:38.585
No idea.

43:39.066 --> 43:40.247
It doesn't look accidental.

43:41.208 --> 43:42.369
It looks too neat for that.

43:44.531 --> 43:50.616
You were saying earlier, these are probably books that came in along with large lots that you purchased.

43:50.636 --> 43:52.618
You said about a truckload, which you were

43:53.206 --> 44:00.195
specifically buying for particular rarities, but this more or less came along with the... Pretty much, pretty much.

44:00.235 --> 44:08.645
And when you buy whole libraries and also sometimes you buy things and then you find out on collation that they're defective and you return them.

44:09.146 --> 44:11.569
And this cost is one pound in Hodgson's in 1946.

44:11.609 --> 44:14.192
So that's been in here for 51 years.

44:14.533 --> 44:14.713
Yeah.

44:14.733 --> 44:18.578
Yeah, a couple other titles if you get them.

44:18.638 --> 44:19.479
I just read them out.

44:19.499 --> 44:22.943
This is a rather dull edition of

44:23.412 --> 44:25.654
of Catelyn, in that they're not coloured.

44:27.236 --> 44:29.398
But look, it still has illustrations in there.

44:29.418 --> 44:35.224
Yeah, and it's in here because two or three of the plates are loose, and it's lacking the errata slip.

44:37.806 --> 44:42.771
But Catelyn is still... That book is probably saleable in its present condition.

44:43.512 --> 44:48.617
Yeah, it probably is, but we're very happy doing this.

44:48.637 --> 44:49.538
...a sort of a lost aspect of the time being.

44:50.885 --> 44:56.070
So is there a phrase, is there a Meg's standard, a Meg's?

44:56.550 --> 45:02.496
What you're suggesting to me is that while others might list that book or offer it, you won't.

45:03.757 --> 45:07.021
Well, it's more complicated than that.

45:08.282 --> 45:18.211
We're partly talking about change in the book trailer for the last 40 or 50 years under contradictory trends going on.

45:18.952 --> 45:19.913
Stories are never linear.

45:20.230 --> 45:21.672
They can't be.

45:21.692 --> 45:22.834
I mean, life just isn't like that.

45:22.914 --> 45:38.119
And so on the one hand, we've got books becoming rarer, and so people, a book which one time would have been considered unsaleable because it lacks an errata leaf, nowadays, when there hasn't been another copy in the market for five years, well, people sort of have to buy what they want, and their standards have had to go down.

45:38.600 --> 45:47.014
On the other hand, people are more rigorous about the description of the book, and so it is much more frowned upon to perfect a copy.

45:47.483 --> 45:57.774
You see, if you look at Dickens in Parts, it's a great example, you know, the monthly issues of Dickens, which was hugely popular as they were collecting in the 1920s.

45:58.454 --> 46:01.317
And there was a wholesale industry in fabricating these.

46:02.358 --> 46:10.006
The bibliographer had his idea of what the perfect pickwick in Parts was, and he should have this advert, that advert, and the other advert.

46:10.347 --> 46:16.393
And maybe one or two copies existed in their natural state, which had all the adverts they should have in the right order.

46:16.627 --> 46:30.942
But once he had decreed that that was the correct one, then all the booksellers, with the tacit support of the collectors, I mean, it wasn't a particularly deceptive thing to do.

46:30.982 --> 46:36.248
They went around taking adverts from other copies, other books, and shoving them and playing around with them.

46:36.268 --> 46:44.997
Whereas nowadays, the easiest Dickens in parts to sell would be one with one owner provenance, original condition, not restored, not knocked about with,

46:45.263 --> 46:50.310
because it was recognized for our generations.

46:50.810 --> 47:07.952
The present generation is always convinced that it is unambiguously right, and it's not a relative judgment, but it does seem to me that it's, you know, if you're collecting books, the whole point of doing it is that you want it in condition as issued, you know, because it gets you closer to the... This is interesting.

47:07.972 --> 47:09.394
What floor are we on?

47:09.414 --> 47:10.455
This is in the Muse building.

47:11.016 --> 47:14.320
Oh, so this is an adjoin, this is kind of like an annex we might call it.

47:14.340 --> 47:14.781
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:15.942 --> 47:17.964
Okay, that's good.

47:17.984 --> 47:18.385
Excellent.

47:18.405 --> 47:20.768
No, but this is an extraordinary archive.

47:20.788 --> 47:22.390
It is an extraordinary archive.

47:22.410 --> 47:25.493
Yeah, but not for sale.

47:25.513 --> 47:26.034
Not for sale.

47:26.054 --> 47:27.356
Quite well indexed.

47:27.376 --> 47:28.597
It is well indexed?

47:28.617 --> 47:29.979
Yeah, good.

47:30.119 --> 47:32.342
So these are important books, right?

47:32.482 --> 47:41.933
Well, there are important books among it, and there are books which have probably become more important since they were put here, and there are also books which have become less important or less salable.

47:43.634 --> 47:47.058
depending upon current fashion, I guess.

47:47.098 --> 47:50.562
Just for the travel department.

47:50.582 --> 47:56.709
I'm not a travel book board, so I can't really... Well, we're looking at Cook's Voyages over there, 1772, 1775.

47:56.769 --> 47:59.793
That's a pretty important book, as a matter of fact.

48:00.133 --> 48:00.734
Oh, yeah.

48:00.754 --> 48:01.795
I'm in many good bits here.

48:01.815 --> 48:01.976
Great.

48:02.276 --> 48:05.259
All right.

48:05.420 --> 48:06.581
Through the Dark Continent.

48:06.661 --> 48:08.824
It's going to be Stanley, of course, right?

48:08.844 --> 48:09.504
Volume 1.

48:10.045 --> 48:11.227
Illustrated.

48:11.247 --> 48:11.667
I don't know.

48:13.064 --> 48:26.125
And the drains here for swapping out, or whatever they call it.

48:26.886 --> 48:29.050
And that structure up there is the hay chute.

48:30.672 --> 48:31.954
Oh, this is a hay chute.

48:31.974 --> 48:33.717
So one of the rough places we've been in the hay log.

48:34.198 --> 48:38.565
And finally this all sort of tumbled down, you know, it was before hay was baled.

48:40.351 --> 48:43.015
Where would they keep the carriages we kept in here as well?

48:43.035 --> 48:59.541
I think the carriage next door, a little sort of garage there, and the horses in here, this would have probably been the tack room, and upstairs the officers and maids, and you probably saw a little bit of a Victorian war collector up there, which we should get from here.
