00:03.052 --> 00:05.115
So you said you have a lot of books with stories.

00:05.335 --> 00:11.703
When Kepler published his epitome of Copernican astronomy, he did it in sections.

00:11.723 --> 00:21.015
So it's awfully expensive if you get it complete, but I was able sort of piecemeal to buy the sections when they came up.

00:21.035 --> 00:29.305
And this particular one was advertised as being sections 5, 6, and 7, which is the ending part.

00:29.325 --> 00:32.569
But I could tell from the collation that that wasn't right.

00:33.072 --> 00:48.887
because it says here on the title page that it's books five, six, and seven, but this is Liber Cortis, number four, which is here, but there's no title page for it.

00:48.907 --> 00:58.656
And then you do hit five and six and seven at the end, but number four was published separately.

00:58.676 --> 01:01.358
What I discovered rather recently was

01:02.367 --> 01:10.380
On February 15, 1621, Kepler wrote to his friend Berneger that he had sent him a copy of Book 4 lacking the title and the preamble.

01:11.081 --> 01:17.251
And on the 21st of August, 1621, he wrote that he had 17 copies lacking this part.

01:17.932 --> 01:21.498
And it's interesting that this copy lacks those parts.

01:21.518 --> 01:23.040
And it's in a very early binding.

01:23.882 --> 01:25.023
So it's been like that.

01:25.464 --> 01:27.227
I have to assume.

01:27.528 --> 01:32.794
that it's one of those seventeen copies Kepler had early from the press before the agreement finished.

01:32.874 --> 01:36.397
And you discovered this by reading Kepler's papers and stuff?

01:36.438 --> 01:40.141
Yeah, it's in the Kepler edition of the correspondence.

01:40.482 --> 01:41.403
I stumbled on it.

01:41.423 --> 01:42.444
You didn't stumble.

01:42.584 --> 01:43.505
There's no luck here.

01:43.545 --> 01:45.908
This is detective work.

01:45.928 --> 01:46.949
It really is.

01:46.969 --> 01:53.035
Somebody then said, Jimmy, if I take the title page and dedication out of my book, it makes it more valuable.

01:53.936 --> 01:55.678
I said, well,

01:56.333 --> 01:59.056
It depends on what the integrity of the book is.

01:59.116 --> 02:01.239
I think that would be, exactly.

02:01.259 --> 02:02.160
Oh, this is delightful.

02:02.600 --> 02:15.275
I should just advise you that it's ten minutes to twelve if you're... Yeah, no, it's about time for me to get this exam published in a more final form.

02:15.715 --> 02:24.906
This is the world's largest collection of ephemerities in here of the 16th and 17th century.

02:25.274 --> 02:33.203
Now, an ephemeris is... Well, you say the lead for last, as we say in the Chinese paper business.

02:34.124 --> 02:42.494
An ephemeris is a book that lists several years of planetary positions day by day.

02:43.255 --> 02:48.421
And I'll show you one just so you get an idea of why they can be extremely interesting.

02:48.441 --> 02:55.129
Now, I'm interested in them because I'm interested in looking at the accuracy of these planetary positions

02:55.345 --> 03:04.776
to see how they were computing the tables, and to watch the progress as astronomical computations gradually become more sophisticated.

03:04.816 --> 03:12.204
So that's how I got into book collecting in the first place, to get examples of these, actually to use for the research.

03:12.424 --> 03:24.458
And that's E-P-H-E-M-E-R-I-D-E-S-F-M-E-R-I-D-E-S-F-M-E-R-I-D-E-S-F-M-E-R-I-D-E-S-F-M-E-R-I-D-E-S-F-M-E-R-I-D-E-S-F-M-E-R-I-D-E-S-F-M-E-R-I-D-E-S-F-M-E-R-I-D-E-S-F-M-E-R-I-D-E-S-F-M-E

03:24.978 --> 03:29.522
He was a, sorry, he was a rival of Galileo's.

03:29.822 --> 03:34.447
He got the job in Bologna that Galileo wanted.

03:36.348 --> 03:38.530
This man also corresponds with Kepler.

03:38.550 --> 03:45.857
In the back of this book, there are, there's the first printing of some of the Kepler correspondents.

03:46.277 --> 03:53.123
But this particular copy is interesting to me because it was owned by an official in the Vatican.

03:53.143 --> 03:54.985
And he has written

03:55.218 --> 04:01.067
in the margins various things that are going on at the time.

04:01.127 --> 04:04.873
He writes what the weather is when the river is flooded.

04:06.396 --> 04:07.157
Stuff like that here.

04:07.177 --> 04:09.501
It's raining, raining for two days on end.

04:10.202 --> 04:12.826
And we're looking at the year 1621 here, too.

04:14.749 --> 04:18.836
And there are still mysterious things for me.

04:19.276 --> 04:20.398
This is kind of cute.

04:20.665 --> 04:31.037
Somebody must have brought a telescope to the Vatican because there is Jupiter with the four satellites Galileo had discovered on each side of them.

04:31.057 --> 04:36.323
What do you feel when you see that, when you go by that and you see that?

04:37.544 --> 04:39.606
I think it's real neat.

04:40.427 --> 04:42.570
There must be a thrill and a feeling.

04:42.610 --> 04:45.693
Oh, it's very interesting to see it.

04:45.713 --> 04:47.415
Here the Arno has flooded.

04:48.172 --> 04:53.097
How does this help you directly with your work?

04:53.458 --> 04:59.404
You say you became a bibliophile to acquire these books for your work.

04:59.424 --> 05:03.208
In order to examine how the positions are being computed.

05:03.288 --> 05:06.972
For example, the positions of the planets.

05:07.193 --> 05:16.643
Because this is claims on the title page that these positions are

05:16.977 --> 05:25.785
are most accurately corrected and so on, and that this is newly computed or something.

05:25.805 --> 05:42.921
And since he has in the back the information as to how Kepler would have done it, you might suppose that Magini is the very first person to use Kepler's calculations for making his ephemerides.

05:43.381 --> 05:44.082
No.

05:44.433 --> 05:51.107
Because I also have his previous version, and the numbers are exactly the same.

05:51.688 --> 05:57.120
So despite his claims on the title page, he has not actually recomputed the positions.

05:57.621 --> 05:59.285
And you said you have the largest collection?

05:59.585 --> 06:01.630
You mean in private hands, or the largest collection?

06:02.371 --> 06:05.057
Well, maybe by the time you print the book, I will have...

06:05.493 --> 06:09.817
fully made the comparison between the British Library and the Bibliotheque Nationale.

06:09.877 --> 06:14.482
I've narrowed it down to the fact that those are the only two competitors at this point.

06:14.502 --> 06:16.044
And do you have an idea of numbers?

06:16.344 --> 06:17.105
How many volumes?

06:22.250 --> 06:24.532
Well, it's sort of the bookshelves down here.

06:24.572 --> 06:27.996
That, I mean, 20 feet of them.

06:28.376 --> 06:28.656
Sure.

06:29.717 --> 06:33.441
I mean, because it's the two shelves there.

06:34.484 --> 06:36.006
Because they're not all there.

06:36.287 --> 06:39.853
Several hundred volumes, to be sure.

06:40.053 --> 06:43.499
No, I don't think several hundred volumes, but 20 feet of shelf space.

06:43.539 --> 06:44.460
Okay, fair enough.

06:46.063 --> 06:46.944
This is interesting.

06:47.245 --> 06:49.468
You should do a little catalog of it, actually.

06:49.509 --> 06:50.490
Have you thought of doing that?

06:51.472 --> 06:53.495
Well, I'm working towards something.

06:54.136 --> 06:56.560
Look, Pope Gregory XV died.

06:57.215 --> 06:59.598
So he has that in there like a news bulletin, right?

06:59.618 --> 07:02.340
He had that for 1623, was that right?

07:02.661 --> 07:03.241
That's right.

07:03.462 --> 07:05.324
On a page for 1623.

07:05.504 --> 07:06.325
Another 1623 page.

07:06.405 --> 07:17.857
And now Cardinal Barberini has been created, the Pontifex Maximus, and is called Urban the Eight.

07:17.977 --> 07:22.001
And Urban the Eight is the one who has the confrontation with Galileo.

07:22.302 --> 07:22.682
Wow.

07:22.949 --> 07:32.480
So why is he putting these little news... Well, you don't really need to know it to the nearest ten minutes when he's elected, unless you're planning to do a horoscope.

07:32.500 --> 07:35.464
And so he does do this to the nearest ten minutes.

07:35.484 --> 07:36.865
What does he do to the nearest ten minutes?

07:36.885 --> 07:40.710
He records... When Barbarini is elected Pope.

07:40.730 --> 07:42.272
And what does he say, December 6th?

07:42.772 --> 07:43.413
Is that what he says?

07:44.074 --> 07:45.175
No, this is in August.

07:45.195 --> 07:49.781
It's the sixth day, the 15th hour, and the 10th minute.

07:49.801 --> 07:50.982
And he knows when...

07:51.316 --> 07:57.604
Pope Gregory just died to 21 hours and three quarters.

07:57.984 --> 07:58.245
Wow.

07:59.005 --> 08:00.267
And this is also for 1623.

08:00.407 --> 08:01.889
And who's the author once more?

08:02.009 --> 08:04.092
I'm sure it's in here.

08:04.192 --> 08:06.254
Magini is the author of the book.

08:06.455 --> 08:09.278
But the man who's writing the annotations.

08:09.298 --> 08:09.979
Oh, this is the owner.

08:09.999 --> 08:11.321
This is an unknown owner then.

08:11.361 --> 08:14.044
No, he's got his name in the book someplace.

08:14.364 --> 08:18.349
You have to really read carefully before you find it.

08:18.590 --> 08:18.910
But he...

08:19.109 --> 08:20.070
That's exciting.

08:20.231 --> 08:21.312
Is a known official.

08:22.053 --> 08:28.642
You see what you've taken as a book that 99.9 people would find totally boring, wouldn't they?

08:28.962 --> 08:29.763
Or inaccessible.

08:29.803 --> 08:30.785
And look what you've done with it.

08:32.086 --> 08:34.089
Krauss, huh?

08:34.390 --> 08:35.511
Yeah.

08:35.531 --> 08:41.219
Now, did they do all the... They figured out that it was from the library of Gregorio Cibo.

08:41.239 --> 08:45.504
Gregorio, G-R-E-G-O-R-I-O, Cibo, C-Y-B-O.

08:46.185 --> 08:48.188
Can you just read what else they say about him?

08:48.320 --> 08:59.496
Deacon at the court of Pope Gregory XV, see his entry at 15 February 1622, with his annotations in the year 1621-29, and purchased on a final pastown dated 1620.

09:00.217 --> 09:00.597
Okay.

09:01.839 --> 09:04.323
So that's a... That's a plum.

09:04.543 --> 09:05.665
That really is.

09:05.705 --> 09:07.047
That's magnificent.

09:07.728 --> 09:09.971
Okay, you know, I know you're running a little late.

09:10.011 --> 09:11.653
Were you going to inscribe my book for me?

09:11.773 --> 09:12.574
Oh, yeah.

09:12.594 --> 09:13.856
I might as well let you take it.

09:14.657 --> 09:15.959
And this is the copy for me.

09:15.979 --> 09:17.922
And you were going to allow me, I guess, to...

09:18.745 --> 09:22.468
to the Italian gentleman you're going to see?

09:22.488 --> 09:22.649
Oh, yes.

09:22.669 --> 09:24.991
I thought I would better give you that after I visit.

09:25.011 --> 09:26.672
Okay, fine.

09:26.952 --> 09:27.353
Fair enough.

09:27.633 --> 09:28.514
So I know a little better.

09:28.534 --> 09:38.383
I just spent six very interesting hours in the Royal Greenwich Observatory archives, which are now in the Cambridge University Library.

09:38.983 --> 09:39.524
Oh, look at that.

09:39.884 --> 09:42.867
This is what is known as a crock.

09:42.887 --> 09:44.588
Why don't you turn on your tape recorder?

09:44.869 --> 09:45.249
It's on.

09:45.269 --> 09:46.390
Just put it on when you start it.

09:46.825 --> 09:49.750
Crock, C-R-O-C-K.

09:49.770 --> 09:52.654
Yeah, incomplete, miserable sort of thing.

09:53.896 --> 09:55.418
It's a folio-sized book.

09:55.438 --> 09:56.460
It's a pretty big book.

09:56.500 --> 09:57.502
It's bound in blue.

09:58.063 --> 10:00.106
That's very important, this blue paper.

10:02.770 --> 10:12.104
Well, I saw it in the Dunham sale from Sotheby's, and I thought, oh, they must be misdescribing it or something, and I just passed it over.

10:12.645 --> 10:13.727
But one of the

10:13.994 --> 10:18.441
book dealer friends from England, Roger Gaskell, said, you know, you ought to look very carefully at that book.

10:18.461 --> 10:20.123
I think it's rather interesting.

10:21.045 --> 10:25.131
But it was in a lot with a Flamsteed Atlas.

10:26.093 --> 10:40.775
Now, what's interesting about this book is that this is called the Historia Celestis, and it has the observations that the first astronomer royal, John Flamsteed, was making at the Greenwich Observatory.

10:41.777 --> 10:42.077
But

10:42.766 --> 10:52.757
He was a, uh, felt he wasn't getting proper support from the government and he didn't have enough assistance to get the stuff copied out and so on.

10:52.817 --> 10:55.600
And he was a very reluctant publisher.

10:56.100 --> 11:03.909
And Isaac Newton was really chafing at the bit because he wanted those lunar observations to check out his new lunar theory.

11:04.870 --> 11:09.735
So he got himself and Edmund Halley appointed on a board of visitors from the

11:09.985 --> 11:13.729
observatory to make sure that the king was getting his money's worth.

11:14.450 --> 11:25.202
And they did a certain amount of scheming and got the manuscript material from Newton and proceeded to press with it, despite Flamsteed's objections.

11:26.163 --> 11:33.551
And eventually this book came out in 1712, a little bit more than twice as thick as what you see here.

11:34.992 --> 11:37.495
When political fortunes changed,

11:38.234 --> 11:56.793
Flamstein was able to get the 300 undistributed copies back, whereupon he took out the part that, the earlier part that had been printed and that he approved of, to recycle into his authorized edition, but he burnt the rest of it.

11:56.813 --> 11:59.596
What you have here are only the pages that were burned.

12:01.258 --> 12:01.638
Wow.

12:02.198 --> 12:03.820
Not the pages that were saved.

12:04.020 --> 12:05.642
How does that happen?

12:05.892 --> 12:18.105
If you start to think about it, the only way that can happen is that this is a copy from which Flamsteed has taken the material to be recycled, but which for some reason he has chosen to save.

12:20.787 --> 12:21.588
That's amazing.

12:21.829 --> 12:34.802
He's chosen to save it because it is a working copy from Greenwich Observatory in which everything that Halley has done has been very carefully crossed out.

12:35.643 --> 12:39.249
because he's furious at the changes that were made.

12:39.810 --> 12:47.903
Not only that, but a certain number of stars have been crossed out, a lot of changes that Hallie made in the numbers he's taking exception to.

12:47.944 --> 12:58.461
So I got a friend who really wanted the Flamsteed Atlas, and we bid and lost.

12:59.538 --> 13:07.044
And Roger Gaskell said, yeah, but the guy who got it probably really wanted the Atlas, and he probably doesn't want that old incomplete crock.

13:07.064 --> 13:09.466
So it was a telephone bit, anonymous.

13:09.827 --> 13:14.551
Why don't you call, why don't you send a letter to Socrates and make an offer?

13:15.952 --> 13:19.295
So I did exactly that.

13:19.555 --> 13:24.059
And the next thing I knew, I had W. Graham Arater on the phone.

13:24.079 --> 13:24.539
Interesting.

13:24.899 --> 13:25.640
You know the name.

13:25.760 --> 13:26.801
Indeed, yeah.

13:26.821 --> 13:27.561
Uh-huh.

13:27.581 --> 13:29.443
I guess he'd already cut up the Atlas.

13:30.048 --> 13:32.933
Quite in character, isn't it?

13:32.953 --> 13:33.333
Yeah.

13:33.353 --> 13:45.092
I suspect, in due time, he would have cut out these three beautiful engraved headbands, framed them up, and thrown the rest of it away.

13:46.935 --> 13:47.396
Amazing.

13:49.179 --> 13:57.152
So, with the manuscripts there, it was possible to really figure out what was going on.

13:57.453 --> 14:09.932
book, adding to what they had in the manuscripts, made it very clear as to what had happened and what Flamsteen was objecting to and so on.

14:09.952 --> 14:15.800
By getting that book, by getting what you did, you were able to solve a puzzle, actually.

14:16.261 --> 14:19.005
Which is going into an article in

14:19.255 --> 14:22.760
Flamsteed Symposium that is just being assembled.

14:22.780 --> 14:25.183
And that's Flamsteed Historiary Coalition.

14:25.243 --> 14:31.052
Briefly, the speech that you're giving at the Grolier next week, will that be published in the Gazette of the Grolier Club, do you think?

14:31.192 --> 14:46.754
No, they seem somehow to want to publish something, and I'm not exactly sure what we're going to do about it, because part of it will be storytelling that's not just easy to write out, and a lot of it will be some good new results that they would definitely want to print.

14:47.134 --> 14:49.077
But I've essentially...

14:50.457 --> 14:55.342
offered these people an article, so I think the serious form of it will come out here.

14:55.362 --> 14:56.543
Do you know when that might be?

14:56.563 --> 14:59.165
Because I certainly would like to quote it at some point.

14:59.666 --> 15:03.930
As soon as I have a manuscript, I can send you a copy of that bulletin.

15:06.132 --> 15:08.214
What, is it Du Bibliophile?

15:08.234 --> 15:08.815
Du Bibliophile.

15:08.835 --> 15:14.160
But do you think at some point, because if I have a copy of your manuscript, I will reference it in my book.

15:15.081 --> 15:15.882
Yeah.

15:15.982 --> 15:17.143
Which I think would be worthwhile.

15:17.343 --> 15:20.346
I am going to give a very nice bibliography again to this new book.

15:20.528 --> 15:45.507
