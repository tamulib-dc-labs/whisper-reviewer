WEBVTT

00:02.225 --> 00:04.768
Okay.

00:05.288 --> 00:08.531
We can go to another apartment if you want.

00:08.551 --> 00:09.072
Do you want to?

00:09.813 --> 00:14.578
I mean, do you have that two or three page thing I wrote to somebody about what the library were?

00:14.798 --> 00:16.620
I would love.

00:17.521 --> 00:19.943
Princeton, I think.

00:19.963 --> 00:20.764
Yes.

00:20.784 --> 00:26.730
It's a recent one where the strengths of the collection are where I thought they were and what I was doing.

00:28.398 --> 00:28.899
Okay.

00:29.119 --> 00:33.724
Just let's start generally, and if you don't mind, just tell me about this, the genesis of this.

00:34.024 --> 00:43.474
The genesis happened through sexual intercourse, had children.

00:43.854 --> 00:45.456
Ask a question, you get an answer.

00:46.938 --> 00:55.907
My wife was interested or taught children's art as a docent in the museum, and...

00:57.558 --> 00:59.140
came out of an art background.

01:00.021 --> 01:01.943
Pardon me for interrupting, but you're Californian?

01:02.003 --> 01:07.909
No, I was from Boston, and she was from Los Angeles.

01:09.170 --> 01:14.956
And I came out here in the Navy, and she was here and married her, and then I went back to school again back east.

01:14.976 --> 01:18.841
Went to school in the east, and went back to graduate school.

01:18.861 --> 01:25.928
And we had children out here, and in the course of having...

01:26.195 --> 01:28.677
several children, a couple children, three, four children.

01:31.240 --> 01:36.465
We would read to the children every night, or she would read, and I would tell stories.

01:37.145 --> 01:44.412
And my background at that time was I was doing archaeology, and I would tell sort of Greek myths.

01:45.413 --> 01:47.876
I mean, you were working as an archaeologist?

01:48.777 --> 01:48.977
Yeah.

01:49.057 --> 01:50.498
I graduated Harvard Business School.

01:51.159 --> 01:55.543
I got a fellowship in American School of Classical Studies.

01:55.675 --> 02:05.066
And so I spent, I don't know, 25, 30 excavating seasons in Greece, plus a couple of years.

02:05.887 --> 02:08.430
This book is going to open in Pergamum, by the way.

02:09.231 --> 02:12.595
I'm going to have a wonderful tour.

02:13.496 --> 02:19.062
Well, we have some of the earliest children's material, not earliest, okay?

02:19.082 --> 02:22.206
But we have some from 2100 B.C.,

02:22.557 --> 02:27.304
which are children's tablets, learning how to write.

02:27.324 --> 02:30.188
But anyway, so I read the children.

02:30.208 --> 02:34.454
And when I'd travel out of Jewish guilt, I'd bring home a book.

02:35.235 --> 02:36.256
I'd travel a lot.

02:36.276 --> 02:39.040
So wherever I was, I'd bring home a story, a children's book.

02:39.121 --> 02:40.903
My wife collected illustrative materials.

02:40.943 --> 02:43.847
So your wife was a collector?

02:43.927 --> 02:45.790
Not books so much, no.

02:46.711 --> 02:49.736
She's a bibliophile, I guess.

02:49.896 --> 02:52.159
More interested in the art part, the illustrator.

02:52.595 --> 02:56.179
So we'd start off with the period of 1883.

02:56.380 --> 03:02.247
That was a year she liked Charles Robert Robinson's or the Cranes and things like that.

03:03.028 --> 03:07.132
And we were buying 25 cents was as much as we wanted to spend.

03:07.153 --> 03:08.214
And then it was a dollar.

03:09.035 --> 03:10.416
And then it got up to $5.

03:10.597 --> 03:15.623
So gathering at this point, your means were modest.

03:15.643 --> 03:21.590
Yeah, I think when I got out of graduate school at Harvard, I think I got my first job was $5,500.

03:21.990 --> 03:22.551
Okay.

03:23.459 --> 03:25.702
So I wasn't poor.

03:27.004 --> 03:28.246
Her family was well off.

03:29.187 --> 03:32.291
I never, I always felt my family was middle class.

03:32.311 --> 03:32.672
It was.

03:32.992 --> 03:35.275
By your day of Bostonian, is that what you said there?

03:35.295 --> 03:36.857
Yeah, yeah.

03:36.877 --> 03:40.222
And so, but I read a lot.

03:40.262 --> 03:42.225
My brother and I were brought up reading a lot.

03:42.245 --> 03:46.771
We read pretty much, thanks.

03:49.495 --> 03:51.257
Is that for me, I hope?

03:51.277 --> 03:53.280
Yeah, I don't know if it's for you, but I'm looking for it.

04:01.090 --> 04:30.996
so anyway we started browsing and collecting used books out here and reading to the children one of the earliest recollections was Bruno Munari illustrated books and they had to be illustrated picture and up through from 1960 about till about 79 I think we grew the collection had about

04:31.634 --> 04:44.072
4,000 books, various things, focusing more or less on early Victorian, Victorian, and contemporary.

04:46.897 --> 05:00.797
In 1979, my wife died, and I sort of moved from treasurer to president of the collection.

05:01.537 --> 05:09.965
And I had more means at that time, so the price went from $5 to $10 to $100 a book.

05:09.985 --> 05:13.008
And when we were in New York, I used to stop at Chotsky's.

05:14.110 --> 05:21.777
And I'm just sorry I didn't buy everything, but occasionally I'd buy a book and really enjoy a children's book.

05:21.797 --> 05:24.440
And then I met Justin Chiller.

05:24.960 --> 05:31.527
So I, in a sense, had relationships with certain

05:32.148 --> 05:38.374
people who I thought were knowledgeable or who certainly knew a lot more than I did and still do.

05:39.675 --> 05:46.562
In fact, I liked Shotsky so much and feel indebted to him and really admired him.

05:46.742 --> 05:49.665
He's a very knowledgeable man.

05:49.745 --> 05:58.493
I told Princeton that there were three people I would like to name, you know, different parts of the library, and Shotsky was one because he'd never been honored.

05:58.996 --> 05:59.597
I called him.

05:59.697 --> 06:00.979
He was the first person.

06:01.279 --> 06:03.803
I'll get that in the second chapter.

06:03.823 --> 06:07.508
And I thought Justin Schiller, who was sort of inherited his mantle.

06:09.211 --> 06:13.076
And my wife got me started in this.

06:14.778 --> 06:18.484
So there were going to be different names in this?

06:18.584 --> 06:19.425
We'll get to that.

06:19.505 --> 06:28.598
Well, anyway, we ended up calling it the Coats and Children Collection.

06:29.118 --> 06:34.245
Library, CCL, yeah, Children's, Children's Library.

06:34.265 --> 06:43.438
And in that can be many different collections, because I felt people might want to give, but they didn't want to be known as the Rockefeller Museum and everything known by that.

06:44.239 --> 06:55.615
So there's different people who can give, or if I bought certain collections, I would keep that collection as a whole together and with that person's name on it.

06:56.692 --> 07:02.343
But I'm wondering at what point, it sounds like it just, and I think you're very modest.

07:02.403 --> 07:05.049
I mean, you went to bringing books home for the children.

07:06.411 --> 07:15.008
But to go from 4,000 volumes to a chest in Chile suggested the finest children's library.

07:15.590 --> 07:18.295
You know, you've got to take money.

07:18.562 --> 07:29.476
You've got to take Justin with a grain of salt, because he's one of my major suppliers, or the major supplier, and certainly a guide, the main guide in building.

07:30.417 --> 07:33.381
He's always said, focus, go for this, go for that, etc.

07:33.821 --> 07:38.547
And I'm like a little boy in a candy store, a deli, I want a little of this.

07:38.567 --> 07:44.535
So I buy each smorgasbord, and he focuses on either roast beef or...

07:45.005 --> 07:45.446
Turkey.

07:45.846 --> 07:58.106
But it seems to me that there's a point to what you went beyond collecting, and it almost seems like you... I think I was... This is a major... I think one... Yeah.

07:58.126 --> 08:06.199
It certainly... It'll go into... Yeah, it'll go into eight figures.

08:09.264 --> 08:09.925
Eight figures.

08:11.728 --> 08:11.788
Mm.

08:13.203 --> 08:16.306
Because you're building your facility.

08:16.326 --> 08:16.586
Yeah.

08:17.127 --> 08:20.330
Do you have plans for it?

08:20.370 --> 08:21.952
I think they should have been improved already.

08:22.372 --> 08:22.653
Really?

08:24.234 --> 08:24.334
Yeah.

08:25.175 --> 08:29.760
It's fairly... One, I read and I liked reading.

08:30.240 --> 08:40.891
Two, personally, before I got married even, I thought reading opened windows in the world to me from my rather sheltered life.

08:41.532 --> 08:42.653
It gave imagination.

08:43.122 --> 08:55.444
And three, I was interested in art, not as much as my wife, but the wedding of the word and the picture seemed to grab me and grab the children.

08:56.646 --> 09:02.476
And it became a participative with the children, not just reading, but reading, questioning, etc.

09:03.117 --> 09:04.219
And I've always felt that was

09:04.570 --> 09:11.980
There's a relationship that electronic media cannot replace in the early age, and I think the early age.

09:12.000 --> 09:16.487
We haven't been interested in Montessori for the early age.

09:16.507 --> 09:20.452
Our children went to Montessori, schools we either belonged to or started.

09:23.056 --> 09:33.210
But I felt that education was of importance to both of us, and books were a primary tool in that.

09:33.815 --> 09:53.049
From that, as the collection progressed, I was really interested in how children read, how they learn, how they learn prejudice, and what are the differences and commonalities in reflecting their cultures around the world.

09:53.510 --> 09:56.515
How did you educate yourself on that?

09:57.153 --> 09:58.254
No, why should I?

09:58.335 --> 09:59.476
I don't know a little bit.

09:59.656 --> 10:01.399
Oh, come on.

10:01.419 --> 10:02.800
You said you're interested in this, huh?

10:02.820 --> 10:03.581
Yeah, right.

10:03.662 --> 10:14.736
So today, most of my time and most of my money is spent in education of, if not readers, we used to have storytellers come to the house and tell stories.

10:15.157 --> 10:15.637
To your house?

10:15.918 --> 10:16.278
To our house.

10:16.839 --> 10:26.772
We used to have Appalachian storytellers who we met, or a guy, I remember one guy named Starkey, who was, used to be a Don Quixote specialist and

10:27.427 --> 10:40.747
used to travel with the gypsies and play a violin or fiddle, spoke Roma-ish, and yet was the director of the Abbey Veteran, held three professorships here at UCLA.

10:41.889 --> 10:54.328
And he was the nephew, I think, of—oh, who's the illustrator?

10:58.426 --> 11:01.690
Maybe the most famous illustrator in the early 1900s.

11:01.770 --> 11:04.173
Early 1900s?

11:04.653 --> 11:05.434
Children's, yeah.

11:06.435 --> 11:07.737
Not Crookshank.

11:07.957 --> 11:08.217
No.

11:08.598 --> 11:09.078
He was later.

11:10.320 --> 11:10.640
Ivy?

11:12.182 --> 11:12.342
Yes.

11:12.362 --> 11:13.784
Yeah, I'm blanking out.

11:14.404 --> 11:23.995
The illustrator in the early 1900s who did, you know, Anderson who did... Anna Anderson?

11:24.035 --> 11:28.180
No, no, who did the... He was English...

11:28.818 --> 11:30.460
Charles Robinson?

11:32.482 --> 11:33.263
No.

11:34.785 --> 11:36.226
Who did the... He did the Goblin.

11:36.246 --> 11:37.908
He did a lot of illustrations.

11:37.968 --> 11:40.531
Very... Most... Oh.

11:41.312 --> 11:42.453
Anyway.

11:42.473 --> 11:43.554
We have a lot of his stuff.

11:44.715 --> 11:46.237
Bill... No.

11:47.118 --> 11:47.438
Anyway.

11:48.700 --> 11:50.161
He was his nephew, right?

11:50.181 --> 11:50.822
1900s.

11:50.842 --> 11:51.663
That was Rackham.

11:51.783 --> 11:52.124
Rackham.

11:52.584 --> 11:54.346
He was Rackham's nephew, I think.

11:54.366 --> 11:55.247
So...

11:55.632 --> 11:57.735
Anyway, not bad.

11:57.755 --> 12:02.062
Not bad, very good.

12:02.483 --> 12:11.157
So anyway, what I've been interested now, jumping back and forth, is I'm interested in education, I'm interested in teachers.

12:12.098 --> 12:15.784
So I think, I don't know systems, but I think teachers are really important.

12:16.118 --> 12:21.727
I'm also interested in early relationships with a child and early reading.

12:22.068 --> 12:34.808
And not just reading for windows, but the relationship between a mother or father or teacher or child leading into this realm of imagination.

12:35.349 --> 12:40.137
Are books at the core of this?

12:41.039 --> 12:43.122
A lot of things may be the core of it.

12:43.743 --> 12:59.203
but books to me is where I'm at you know so it's a little specialty you know books are maybe one of the key vegetables in the diet but I think books are something everybody can relate to

13:00.382 --> 13:06.071
the libraries tell me, well, why do you want to be in books that's going to go electronic, etc.?

13:06.191 --> 13:11.298
I said, nobody cuddles like your mother with you in bed with electronic.

13:11.318 --> 13:18.269
And it just isn't the reading, it's the emotional arm around you or reading.

13:18.730 --> 13:22.695
It gives an emotional feel to that early reading experience.

13:22.956 --> 13:24.398
Do the libraries study that?

13:24.968 --> 13:31.059
You said they tell you they're going electronic?

13:31.419 --> 13:34.405
I'm really probing this.

13:34.705 --> 13:36.669
I have a couple of books.

13:38.111 --> 13:42.960
I read the New York Times review, and there's been back and forth in that.

13:43.345 --> 13:44.427
I haven't disagreed.

13:44.467 --> 13:51.799
I think, yeah, there's a place between electron and, you know, what's the new technology going to do to the old?

13:51.819 --> 13:54.463
That's going to be my book, you know, this chapter.

13:54.563 --> 13:57.308
I'm going into this with great, great enthusiasm.

13:57.468 --> 14:00.774
And I happen to think there will always be reading.

14:00.794 --> 14:02.597
Well, two weeks ago, you know Paul LeClaire?

14:02.617 --> 14:05.882
He's the president of the New York Public Library.

14:06.042 --> 14:08.246
Yeah, he replaced Martin Gregorian.

14:08.306 --> 14:09.488
He's wonderful.

14:10.447 --> 14:18.455
To put these books down, just to make them for a catalog, it's $40 a book.

14:18.495 --> 14:18.816
Okay.

14:19.717 --> 14:24.381
It's going to be a long time before that stuff is going to be out.

14:24.441 --> 14:27.004
Nobody has that kind of money to do that.

14:27.404 --> 14:29.106
And does it make sense to do it?

14:29.266 --> 14:36.434
Here's UCLA, who's had the author of Welch's collection of early children's books, and it's been 15 years before they got around to doing it.

14:36.874 --> 14:37.495
Isn't that amazing?

14:37.935 --> 14:39.677
And that's why they didn't get this collection.

14:40.366 --> 14:44.493
I wouldn't want to see him lying around in the shoebox.

14:44.873 --> 14:49.541
So what encourages you to feel that it will be used at Princeton?

14:50.182 --> 14:50.863
A couple of things.

14:50.963 --> 14:55.470
But before I go into that, and there are articles, by the way, you should look at in the New York Times.

14:55.530 --> 14:58.756
The book will be in the last year or two on discussions on a couple of books.

15:00.098 --> 15:04.585
And to me, one of the things is that, and I'm...

15:05.560 --> 15:10.464
I know the librarian at Library of Congress is a classmate of mine, and we discuss things.

15:10.484 --> 15:12.006
I'm going to stay in a couple of weeks.

15:12.026 --> 15:15.369
And he's more electronically oriented than I am.

15:15.389 --> 15:16.570
Billington is.

15:16.590 --> 15:17.811
Yeah, Jim.

15:18.131 --> 15:23.236
I see the Library of Congress as a wholesale distributor for us.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.938
That's good stuff.

15:24.958 --> 15:27.160
I'm giving a talk down there.

15:27.520 --> 15:32.985
They have the network, sort of the connections to all the libraries, which are not getting any support.

15:33.125 --> 15:35.247
They can be the key there.

15:35.918 --> 15:41.687
But I'm, even now, have a tender proposal to work.

15:42.107 --> 16:03.820
I envision the children's area there as a leadership telephone, creating a leadership role for children, both literature, which libraries, the local libraries cannot afford, but which they can, in a sense, coordinate and raise, like I'm doing with teachers.

16:03.961 --> 16:04.862
I think a teacher...

16:05.045 --> 16:05.947
is a magician.

16:06.689 --> 16:16.451
And I want to see early recognition system for recognizing teachers early and allowing them to make a megaphone, so to speak.

16:16.471 --> 16:20.119
So what are you doing with teachers?

16:20.139 --> 16:20.961
Well, I've set up

16:22.375 --> 16:27.482
fellowships, chairs, reward systems.

16:27.502 --> 16:29.005
Actually, I've got to know all this stuff.

16:29.025 --> 16:31.348
Is there paperwork?

16:31.448 --> 16:35.194
I sold the business, and I took the money and put it into a foundation.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.238
What's the name of it?

16:38.338 --> 16:42.284
The Coats and Family Foundation.

16:42.724 --> 16:44.507
It's out of California here?

16:45.789 --> 16:48.252
Well, it's down the street.

16:48.272 --> 16:48.653
So,

16:49.747 --> 16:55.396
What I'm doing in terms of Princeton, I went to Princeton.

16:57.719 --> 16:58.420
Studied what?

16:59.582 --> 17:07.194
Well, I got started in physics, almost flunked that, switched to history, graduated that.

17:08.215 --> 17:10.659
I liked it, but didn't do that well.

17:11.200 --> 17:14.885
Came back after the Navy in graduate school in architecture.

17:15.286 --> 17:16.768
Was asked to leave.

17:16.788 --> 17:19.332
Went to business school.

17:20.105 --> 17:26.273
And now I'm, you know, many years later, I'm on the executive committee of the board of trustees in Princeton.

17:26.433 --> 17:27.615
So I'm a big wheel.

17:28.937 --> 17:32.101
And I'm interested in education.

17:32.121 --> 17:33.523
That's elitist education.

17:34.143 --> 17:36.587
But there are other areas of education, early childhood.

17:36.607 --> 17:37.808
You mean Princeton is elitist?

17:37.828 --> 17:38.569
It's elitist, yeah.

17:38.589 --> 17:40.091
Of course, it's Ivy League.

17:40.111 --> 17:41.833
So... Not Ivy League so much.

17:41.873 --> 17:44.637
There are only few people who go to college, really.

17:46.259 --> 17:47.180
College at that level.

17:47.200 --> 17:47.841
It's that level.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.183
And...

17:49.417 --> 17:52.320
Whereas, you know, kindergarten's a different story.

17:53.000 --> 17:59.166
Well, has Princeton given you a firm commitment that this facility is going to go outside?

17:59.866 --> 18:02.189
Well, I set it up with enough money.

18:02.669 --> 18:04.531
One, they get all the books.

18:06.052 --> 18:17.162
Two, they have support, enough income for paying a librarian the most money that any librarian gets in the country.

18:17.834 --> 18:46.913
and the problem is off the record the problem let me hear it the problem is that I set up such a large six figure sum for the librarian and this is a one person in a whole hierarchy and it ruined the system so I said no they said how can we do that when our head guy doesn't get that much so I said be creative they couldn't be creative I said tell you what

18:47.180 --> 18:49.983
Divide it in half and give it one half as travel.

18:50.884 --> 18:51.865
I don't care how you give it.

18:52.666 --> 18:54.768
But why was it important for you to have this?

18:55.089 --> 18:56.750
Because I want the best person possible.

18:58.212 --> 19:02.637
And I want it immune from the cutbacks that usually go through budgets, etc.

19:03.257 --> 19:04.699
So I've set up two researchers.

19:05.580 --> 19:15.010
I've set up money for publication, money for acquisition, and money for a convention, for a yearly seminar.

19:15.732 --> 19:21.318
of all the children for a three-day seminar, plus exhibits, etc.

19:21.838 --> 19:27.444
So there's enough money generated that will cover that ad infinitum.

19:30.887 --> 19:34.611
No, that was me saying enough money to cover.

19:35.351 --> 19:43.039
So the president said what we'll do is in the next 40 years

19:43.913 --> 19:49.020
They've identified six areas, they feel, of study that are not really focused.

19:49.040 --> 19:51.483
One of them is the study of the book.

19:51.503 --> 19:54.307
They think it's in Europe, but not much in America.

19:54.467 --> 19:56.550
The LLC is just starting this now.

19:57.311 --> 20:00.475
The Library of Congress is the center of the book.

20:00.635 --> 20:13.853
Now, he feels also that children and childhood is something that really hasn't been covered in university education.

20:14.474 --> 20:19.400
And so he's willing to put some full-time people on it.

20:20.121 --> 20:29.854
And Princeton already uses history, economics, music, et cetera, into children's literature and things like that for their own courses.

20:30.094 --> 20:30.415
That's right.

20:30.876 --> 20:34.360
So this library will be a research library.

20:34.380 --> 20:37.745
The challenge I made is it's easy to have a research library.

20:38.425 --> 20:41.950
And for this research library, I have probably...

20:43.297 --> 20:45.541
I have all cultures.

20:46.402 --> 20:53.794
When I'm in New Guinea, I go into a school and say, give me your notebooks and I'll trade you some books from America or something like that.

20:53.814 --> 20:54.355
Japan.

20:54.375 --> 20:55.156
So I bought books.

20:56.298 --> 20:58.622
I'm interested in...

21:00.188 --> 21:07.115
books that are prejudiced, like books on blacks, books on anti-Semitism.

21:07.135 --> 21:10.078
So it's no longer just illustrated books, then, obviously.

21:10.098 --> 21:11.899
But it has to have illustrations.

21:11.960 --> 21:14.102
So you still have that requirement?

21:14.442 --> 21:14.782
Yeah.

21:14.802 --> 21:16.444
I had to put some definition on it.

21:17.245 --> 21:21.249
There may be, in the collection, I don't know, 60,000 or 80,000 books.

21:21.269 --> 21:25.353
I have no idea, because they haven't all been catalogued.

21:25.373 --> 21:27.715
But I would say there's no more than...

21:28.387 --> 21:32.371
a couple hundred books that have no pictures on it.

21:32.391 --> 21:34.053
No, the ones from 2100 B.C.

21:34.113 --> 21:34.774
have no pictures.

21:35.735 --> 21:38.158
Not on paper either.

21:38.198 --> 21:41.141
Not on paper on clay tablets, right.

21:42.683 --> 21:45.806
But that's sort of a limitation that I've placed on myself.

21:46.467 --> 21:51.092
Now, I will make an exception for an unusual case.

21:51.853 --> 21:54.455
I have, I think, Luther's only book for children.

21:54.596 --> 21:56.538
There's no pictures.

21:56.558 --> 21:56.858
But...

21:57.580 --> 22:01.546
four-page tract or something.

22:01.566 --> 22:08.836
Betsy Shirley was going to stop her collection at 1900, but she says, but then I couldn't have The Wizard of Oz.

22:09.077 --> 22:15.165
You do have to make exceptions, don't you?

22:15.205 --> 22:26.642
I'm looking for a research collection, but the challenge to Princeton was it's an ivory tower, and researchers tend to like a library where

22:27.280 --> 22:28.882
It's like a prison.

22:28.902 --> 22:36.589
The visitor's on one side of their desk, and the prisoners are on the other side, and there's a big glass wall, and that's our library.

22:37.310 --> 22:40.473
And I've said, if it's a children's library, I want children in there.

22:41.414 --> 22:43.676
And the challenge then is, and I'll pay for it.

22:43.696 --> 22:46.258
So the challenge is how to put the two cultures together.

22:46.278 --> 22:47.940
What was their initial response to that?

22:48.360 --> 22:49.321
I bet it wasn't too good.

22:49.381 --> 22:49.702
Not good.

22:50.382 --> 22:53.826
And it still is not good, and I'm paying for it.

22:54.827 --> 22:56.308
But I've come to the realization that

22:56.558 --> 23:00.323
that I am not going to change the people that much the first time around.

23:00.364 --> 23:02.306
They're not used to this.

23:02.346 --> 23:03.368
They don't know how to cope.

23:03.829 --> 23:06.953
They're not even very good in public relations or reaching out.

23:07.814 --> 23:21.434
See, this is... They would love to get this... I'm just chatting off the top, too, but, I mean, they would love to get this building, and they would love this money, and they would love these books, but they would also love to be left alone to do exactly what they can't be.

23:21.474 --> 23:22.836
So, basically, you're saying...

23:23.272 --> 23:27.718
We're going to set this up, but we have to agree on things together.

23:27.738 --> 23:31.102
And they lose seven to eight figures if they don't do it in three years.

23:32.203 --> 23:32.384
Wow.

23:33.465 --> 23:34.827
And when did this kick in?

23:34.867 --> 23:36.128
When's the thing?

23:36.228 --> 23:37.330
It's two years.

23:37.370 --> 23:38.892
Two years from now.

23:40.133 --> 23:41.155
Now, this is good.

23:41.195 --> 23:43.137
This is going to work fine for my book.

23:43.157 --> 23:43.357
Okay.

23:43.438 --> 23:44.859
We'll probably have to talk again.

23:44.879 --> 23:45.720
This is the first.

23:45.740 --> 23:47.322
So we have a design now.

23:48.644 --> 23:50.106
I didn't pick the architects.

23:50.558 --> 24:01.136
but I really got in there and picked the person who was doing the interaction with it, and I said the children, because I didn't feel it was really pushed ahead.

24:02.038 --> 24:04.442
So, ah, thank you.

24:05.103 --> 24:07.387
Well, I'm not sure that's right yet.

24:07.407 --> 24:08.368
Right.

24:08.388 --> 24:15.300
So, anyway, so what happens is, and I have this lady in New York,

24:15.550 --> 24:20.055
who has come down, and we're designing an entry into the university library.

24:20.456 --> 24:24.260
Now, is this all going to be folded into the Firestone complex?

24:24.601 --> 24:29.927
Yeah, they've given me 4,000 square feet on the right of the Firestone, right in the main thing.

24:29.947 --> 24:30.628
Okay, yeah, I'm familiar with it.

24:30.648 --> 24:34.032
Right, where the computers used to be, and they moved down.

24:34.492 --> 24:42.942
And what we're doing is we're designing an area where children can come in on tour by themselves

24:43.225 --> 24:46.012
and go through a book like a Disneyland thing.

24:46.613 --> 24:50.322
And I even said we can buy 30,000 books.

24:50.342 --> 24:52.948
Princeton gets 30,000 kids a year going through the campus.

24:55.133 --> 25:00.205
President and I said, we want this to be one of the six top visiting places.

25:00.792 --> 25:05.076
And at first, I wanted them to pick up a book and do something.

25:05.096 --> 25:08.920
I suggested, why don't we have electronically in this book stuff, et cetera.

25:09.460 --> 25:16.527
They come in, they put their name in a computer, first name, and out pops a book with Arthur or Solomon or whatever it is.

25:16.907 --> 25:20.010
Now, there are going to be names, African names, we won't have, et cetera.

25:20.431 --> 25:22.773
And for that, I said, this is not going to happen, though.

25:23.213 --> 25:27.998
And I said, why don't we ask them how old their mother is, and then we put out five years later,

25:28.501 --> 25:33.788
take plus five years and we print out ten top children's books that were read at that time.

25:34.589 --> 25:37.834
So the computer is going to be used here.

25:38.154 --> 25:43.101
They can take home something that will give them something to interact with their mother.

25:44.283 --> 25:48.248
A lot of these kids are going to be from not

25:48.920 --> 25:51.583
you know, from not the best sections.

25:51.603 --> 25:52.825
Well, you're not far from Newark.

25:52.845 --> 26:00.114
You're not far from... Right, so we're going to have people named... How do they... This just sounds so unprincedonian, though.

26:00.215 --> 26:05.341
It is, and that's why the president and I are really pushing this as a reach-out program.

26:05.361 --> 26:06.222
So he's with you on that.

26:06.242 --> 26:06.963
He's with him, right.

26:06.983 --> 26:07.544
What's his name?

26:07.564 --> 26:08.065
Shapiro.

26:08.405 --> 26:08.906
Shapiro.

26:10.027 --> 26:10.948
I'll have to talk to him.

26:11.489 --> 26:14.573
So anyway... First name is... Yeah, Harold.

26:17.152 --> 26:21.459
And is Bill Joyce involved in this at all?

26:21.479 --> 26:22.060
Yeah.

26:22.160 --> 26:23.241
I know Bill.

26:23.261 --> 26:24.964
Bill, I've had to push.

26:24.984 --> 26:29.952
Bill thinks I'm not an enemy, but a loose cannon.

26:31.134 --> 26:33.477
I mean, they want the resources.

26:33.497 --> 26:35.280
I don't blame them.

26:35.380 --> 26:38.986
Well, I mean, this is sacred turf, you know what I mean?

26:39.006 --> 26:39.126
Right.

26:39.511 --> 26:42.356
You, in their view, are non-professional.

26:42.416 --> 26:47.385
No, I'm, you know, Dottie Warbucks, and they want me on the other side of the glass window.

26:48.127 --> 26:50.331
That's right.

26:50.351 --> 26:55.620
Was there any point at which that you thought this wasn't, that you might have to try this someplace else?

26:55.701 --> 26:59.207
Well, I left it that if it doesn't go, it all goes to UCLA.

26:59.407 --> 27:01.811
And if it doesn't go there, it goes to a third place.

27:01.951 --> 27:03.073
So you sound like Pepys.

27:03.393 --> 27:03.954
Remember Pepys?

27:04.195 --> 27:09.643
He said, I'll give this to Modlin College and they better keep it this way or it goes over to Trinity.

27:09.663 --> 27:09.863
Right.

27:09.883 --> 27:11.125
So it's illegal.

27:11.346 --> 27:13.149
I'm sure UCLA would have been thrilled.

27:13.209 --> 27:13.730
Totally, yeah.

27:15.412 --> 27:23.845
So anyway, there is this educational component, research, plus the actual interaction with the child.

27:25.047 --> 27:25.548
Not always.

27:26.410 --> 27:26.730
And...

27:27.031 --> 27:33.818
What I've come to my own education is that that probably will, the first time we do this, will not be the best.

27:34.759 --> 27:39.263
So it will go over year after year, and it will change in three or four years.

27:39.644 --> 27:41.706
There's enough, I've left enough to do that.

27:42.987 --> 27:48.493
When you say you'll pay, do you have any kind of a systematic idea of how you're going to get kids?

27:49.033 --> 27:53.278
You just can't go out in the neighborhood and go to the bus and say, come on, we're going to a library today.

27:53.298 --> 27:54.219
I don't have to get kids.

27:54.719 --> 27:55.620
Kids will come.

27:57.355 --> 28:06.631
There are 30,000 kids from K to 12 years, 12th grade, that come through Princeton a year.

28:08.614 --> 28:09.295
That's a lot of kids.

28:09.596 --> 28:12.280
But they're just going there as tourists, basically, right?

28:12.300 --> 28:22.317
By school buses, with their parents, but mostly school buses, from a radius that goes from Camden, I think, up to Newark.

28:23.208 --> 28:25.991
I'm only repeating the data that was given.

28:26.051 --> 28:29.014
How does this relate to literacy and stuff like that?

28:29.034 --> 28:29.495
I can't tell you.

28:29.515 --> 28:33.820
Well, my goal is, I think, as an individual, what can I do?

28:33.880 --> 28:35.822
I can't change pre-motherhood.

28:36.503 --> 28:38.044
I can't change early motherhood.

28:38.104 --> 28:39.946
Those are issues that I can't do.

28:39.966 --> 28:50.498
All I can do is say, if I can do anything, to have a kid walk into a place and come back and say, gee, I'd like to read something, you know, maybe instead of the comic strip or whatever,

28:51.052 --> 28:54.096
What happened to Tom Sawyer when he was so-and-so?

28:55.879 --> 28:57.942
Did he really drown or whatever the hell it was?

28:57.982 --> 29:05.091
If I can stimulate him to want to read a book or pick up a book, that's as much as I can do.

29:07.335 --> 29:09.197
Where it goes from there, I have no idea.

29:09.738 --> 29:14.164
Now, is this being funded through your foundation out here?

29:14.685 --> 29:14.865
Yeah.

29:15.402 --> 29:18.445
Now, is your foundation doing other things besides Princeton?

29:18.465 --> 29:18.846
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:18.986 --> 29:20.408
What kinds of other things?

29:20.928 --> 29:22.470
I'm the Library of Congress.

29:22.490 --> 29:27.495
I'm trying to do something with—I do things with teachers.

29:28.436 --> 29:41.971
I do things here at UCLA with—I've been interested in original material, so I do it with Werner, a program—not for much money.

29:41.991 --> 29:45.375
I said, gee, I'd like to help the outreach program at UCLA at the library.

29:45.828 --> 30:15.548
And so they took library science, which is downgraded, and the education school, and we took two of them together and invited from the state teachers to come here, as I paid for it, and a summer program to do original research on something they wanted to build a course in their classroom, i.e., my goodness, they sent me stuff all the time on it.

30:17.485 --> 30:24.272
what was the position of the Mexican, you know, before California became a state.

30:24.772 --> 30:25.753
And they had the newspapers.

30:26.614 --> 30:29.677
So one teacher did this project.

30:29.697 --> 30:34.322
Or what was the first, in a sense, children's books published?

30:34.422 --> 30:35.463
Or what did they do?

30:35.583 --> 30:36.624
How did they teach children?

30:36.644 --> 30:40.288
Where did the readers, the primers, who did it, et cetera.

30:40.308 --> 30:44.792
So 30 of them did this and then went back to their own classrooms.

30:45.278 --> 30:46.300
and organize a course.

30:46.380 --> 30:52.509
They're so enthusiastic that teachers are riding so high that they've expanded now to the inner city.

30:53.250 --> 30:58.358
If it's successful, the university is state-mandated to make it statewide.

30:58.959 --> 30:59.420
Okay.

31:00.382 --> 31:04.468
Now, the whole deal is less money

31:05.107 --> 31:08.851
than if you flew across and back six times, first class.

31:09.031 --> 31:10.173
It is not much.

31:10.273 --> 31:12.675
In fact, there wasn't as much money.

31:12.695 --> 31:16.560
They gave me some more money back, which never happened.

31:16.580 --> 31:20.224
So anyway, that's something, you know.

31:20.264 --> 31:24.388
You left, you're not actively involved in the business anymore.

31:24.448 --> 31:27.532
I sold the business two years ago, so that's why I'm foundation.

31:27.592 --> 31:28.693
Before that, I had paper.

31:30.015 --> 31:34.860
I still think I'm not well off, but that's a function of...

31:35.245 --> 31:36.346
You know, a long time.

31:36.687 --> 31:38.929
And if you don't mind my asking, how old are you?

31:38.989 --> 31:39.911
Do you mind telling me?

31:39.931 --> 31:40.411
67.

31:40.511 --> 31:41.953
I see.

31:41.973 --> 31:48.681
And I have the sense here of, I mean, would you describe yourself as a driven person?

31:48.761 --> 31:50.663
I mean, as a... I don't know.

31:50.683 --> 31:51.504
Some people might.

31:51.805 --> 32:00.675
I think things happened to me, and I think probably my success was that I was able to... Okay.

32:00.695 --> 32:04.560
Somebody gave, one of my successors gave me, said, Lloyd...

32:07.763 --> 32:11.148
can be inconsistent as long as he knows what's important.

32:13.933 --> 32:17.979
And I think you can be inconsistent as long as you know what's important.

32:17.999 --> 32:19.441
So I've always known what's important.

32:21.024 --> 32:25.231
And I've been able to do that, understand that.

32:25.351 --> 32:31.601
And also from my own success was I could put myself in other people's shoes.

32:31.621 --> 32:33.083
Sensitive enough for that.

32:33.103 --> 32:34.986
So when you sold the business,

32:35.270 --> 32:40.257
Was it with the idea that now I'm going to just commit myself to these projects?

32:40.277 --> 32:41.239
I had enough projects.

32:41.259 --> 32:45.505
I'm chairman of a school, the archaeological school in Athens.

32:45.525 --> 32:46.085
Really?

32:47.007 --> 32:49.050
I'm big in Princeton.

32:49.190 --> 32:49.550
I'm at UCLA.

32:49.691 --> 32:53.316
I'm an advisor at the University of Cincinnati.

32:54.277 --> 32:55.459
In archaeology as well?

32:55.479 --> 32:55.699
Yeah.

32:56.020 --> 32:58.784
So is this the first love, the archaeology?

32:59.104 --> 33:04.011
Archaeology was something that gave me a sense of satisfaction, of achievement.

33:04.261 --> 33:09.748
without family or last name or anything like that.

33:09.768 --> 33:19.000
Uh, then I went into business and was fortunate enough to develop a brand and, you know, somebody paid a lot of money for it.

33:19.020 --> 33:21.764
It was just a neutrogenous part of it.

33:21.784 --> 33:27.151
Because, uh, everybody, my wife said, please tell them.

33:27.191 --> 33:30.655
Yeah, I like to tell them.

33:30.956 --> 33:34.200
But, uh, there was a time and, you know, uh,

33:34.771 --> 33:39.979
I just think business was the end of the world.

33:40.059 --> 33:50.015
Do you have a sense, to spray a little bit here, you know, we hear about dumbing down and kids aren't reading.

33:50.155 --> 34:01.453
Are you fearful that, you know, the state of... I think education, I think public education is necessary for democracy.

34:02.395 --> 34:07.723
And I think to be able to make up your own mind and to interact and to read, et cetera, is really important.

34:08.243 --> 34:10.827
I see that disappear or shrinking.

34:11.969 --> 34:21.522
I also feel that the middle class is shrinking, being squeezed.

34:21.542 --> 34:25.568
And I think people are...

34:26.645 --> 34:29.267
Not able, in a sense, to read.

34:29.287 --> 34:33.851
I was looking at libraries, and we were talking on the computers, and I'm in a business with Gates.

34:36.173 --> 34:36.634
Is that right?

34:36.654 --> 34:39.076
Start-up business, yeah.

34:39.096 --> 34:40.817
Biological.

34:41.618 --> 34:49.785
But I'm saying, to me, computers only speed up the time or the accessibility.

34:50.566 --> 34:51.827
But the libraries had it all.

34:51.987 --> 34:54.949
If somebody really wanted it, they could go in libraries just slower.

34:55.550 --> 34:55.690
Mm-hmm.

34:56.480 --> 34:57.862
but you don't see libraries crowded.

34:58.903 --> 35:06.152
And I think we're going to be disillusioned with the information highway.

35:06.412 --> 35:08.194
There's going to be too much information.

35:08.214 --> 35:10.397
Well, information is just merely that.

35:10.437 --> 35:11.238
I mean, it's data.

35:11.258 --> 35:12.119
It's not knowledge.

35:12.159 --> 35:13.821
You've got to know what to ask for.

35:13.861 --> 35:15.202
It's like in the library.

35:15.222 --> 35:17.245
There's almost too much information out there.

35:17.265 --> 35:20.609
It's making sense of it and using it and taking it to the next level.

35:20.709 --> 35:24.073
And we have involved...

35:24.256 --> 35:31.285
or an observer and somewhat involvement, computers in the classroom in the underprivileged areas or the poor areas.

35:32.427 --> 35:38.415
And it isn't as successful as people have thought.

35:39.136 --> 35:49.529
And one of the real fallbacks is, or failings, is that the teachers themselves are not on board.

35:50.491 --> 35:53.875
They're an older group, and they're afraid...

35:54.243 --> 35:55.364
Well, they don't interact.

35:55.384 --> 36:03.234
I went to, oh, there's a foundation here in Santa Monica.

36:03.254 --> 36:10.963
Mike Milken's foundation spent a lot of money really bringing a lot of teachers.

36:11.624 --> 36:16.169
And they were thanking the teachers, et cetera, and they were doing a lot of computerization, et cetera.

36:16.189 --> 36:20.754
And then they awarded the awards to the teachers, and they asked them what was significant.

36:20.774 --> 36:22.817
None of them mentioned the computer.

36:22.837 --> 36:22.917
Hmm.

36:23.555 --> 36:24.216
not one.

36:25.177 --> 36:26.459
That's amazing, isn't it?

36:26.479 --> 36:34.490
And then when they said how many use it, I think I counted the hands for, I don't know if everybody was a teacher in the audience, but 3%.

36:35.311 --> 36:35.992
That's amazing.

36:36.072 --> 36:38.896
See, I have my computer with me.

36:38.976 --> 36:41.099
I just got to know.

36:41.460 --> 36:51.874
But they're not, and so, and here we've given the police department computers, and to speed the time, only 60% are used.

36:52.175 --> 36:55.140
And the reason is that people don't know how or afraid to use it.

36:55.200 --> 36:57.704
And the same is true when the teachers are afraid.

36:57.724 --> 37:02.831
So the key that comes back to me is you've got to make the teachers first.

37:02.872 --> 37:04.033
You've got to teach the teachers.

37:04.494 --> 37:04.714
Yeah.

37:05.215 --> 37:05.776
That'll come.

37:05.796 --> 37:06.918
I mean, I know what I... It'll come.

37:06.958 --> 37:13.328
The next generation, you know, are... When I have a problem with my computer, I ask my 13-year-old guy.

37:14.469 --> 37:16.733
He's the expert on the computer.

37:16.753 --> 37:18.756
No, my boy runs a teaching program now.

37:19.107 --> 37:19.608
Here?

37:19.868 --> 37:20.609
In computer, yeah.

37:21.030 --> 37:21.891
Princeton Reveal.

37:22.311 --> 37:22.652
Oh, really?

37:24.334 --> 37:24.434
Okay.

37:24.454 --> 37:25.616
So anyway, okay.

37:27.278 --> 37:29.080
Let me know when you want to knock off for today.

37:29.100 --> 37:30.843
Can I get time?

37:31.083 --> 37:31.483
Okay.

37:31.804 --> 37:42.839
Let's talk about, again, if you don't mind jumping around a little bit, and this is good, I'll be able to go over this stuff and maybe listen to the tape tonight, and if you'd give me a couple hours tomorrow, Max, that'll be great.

37:42.859 --> 37:42.999
Mm-hmm.

37:43.760 --> 37:43.900
Mm-hmm.

37:45.263 --> 38:15.270
let's talk about the passion for the books I mean do you go through these you read my book did you share any of these oh yeah I could identify with some of them you know just reading catalogs I think is a time consuming thing but do you enjoy it yeah I go through it and part of it is because I'm the chase part of it is the you know striking goal not the rarity so much boy there's an artist or somebody who really has a style

38:15.959 --> 38:18.823
or something from my childhood.

38:20.305 --> 38:25.393
And so I've really, I've tried to focus on certain, what I call building blocks.

38:26.755 --> 38:33.304
In my own business, I had a vision of a wall, but I only had two bricks.

38:34.326 --> 38:36.128
But I knew this was a wall.

38:36.168 --> 38:38.632
Between those two bricks was space, but I knew it was a wall.

38:38.652 --> 38:40.494
And I've had the same thing about a library.

38:41.075 --> 38:42.257
It can't be comprehensive.

38:42.798 --> 38:44.100
It can't collect everything.

38:44.120 --> 38:44.380
All right.

38:44.630 --> 38:53.564
Well, that's interesting, because there is a point where you did make the leap from collector to scholar, it sounds to me.

38:53.604 --> 38:54.265
Not scholar.

38:54.605 --> 39:00.895
Making available stuff that I think, like I bought, I saw an auction.

39:00.975 --> 39:02.517
I bought children's theater material.

39:03.279 --> 39:04.260
Children's material?

39:04.280 --> 39:05.061
Theater material.

39:05.342 --> 39:12.072
Two publishers, their whole warehouses were being auctioned out in Sotheby's, and

39:12.659 --> 39:13.560
looked at the price.

39:13.780 --> 39:15.702
It was expensive.

39:15.822 --> 39:20.828
But I said, you know, telling stories is like reading stories.

39:21.108 --> 39:24.172
Before literature, there was the storyteller.

39:24.212 --> 39:25.493
There was the Homer.

39:25.513 --> 39:32.140
There was the word-of-mouth, the Slavic bards, etc., where for 600 years not a word was varied.

39:32.160 --> 39:34.162
The same is true in the Old Testament.

39:34.182 --> 39:39.028
That was handed down for probably 800 years without a word variant.

39:40.049 --> 39:41.130
And so the

39:41.448 --> 39:43.410
The Bard had a storytelling.

39:43.430 --> 39:48.716
It was a very strong and monotic type of thing.

39:49.277 --> 39:54.403
So I figured, and this was a dramatic type of thing, so I went and bid and bought it.

39:54.543 --> 39:55.905
Both two things.

39:55.925 --> 39:58.308
And I didn't want to hear, so I sent them to Princeton.

39:58.668 --> 40:01.872
When it came, they called me up and they asked, what did I do?

40:02.072 --> 40:09.421
Turns out it was seven tons of material.

40:09.441 --> 40:09.801
I love that.

40:10.000 --> 40:13.505
Were they appreciative?

40:13.545 --> 40:14.466
Not to.

40:15.347 --> 40:19.233
They had to put it down below in a concrete slab to hold the space, etc.

40:19.353 --> 40:20.455
I hadn't seen it.

40:21.055 --> 40:30.829
But what it does is someday a scholar is going to look at it and it will be important in a research thing, you know, scholarship.

40:31.790 --> 40:39.501
Right now I'm doing different looks at American history and how we look at American history

40:39.785 --> 40:47.538
Not so much through the dates, but through different issues and setting up courses that way and using some of the treatises that the children have.

40:48.239 --> 40:50.843
Or publishing a book on Newbery.

40:50.863 --> 40:51.624
I'm not doing it.

40:51.665 --> 40:52.566
I've supported it.

40:52.887 --> 40:54.048
My librarian's doing it.

40:55.210 --> 40:58.476
Looking at the illustrations of Newbery, the cuts are there.

40:58.496 --> 41:05.387
How they've come from the adult versions, let's say, of Gulliver's Travels, back into the children's, and then back out into the adult's.

41:05.840 --> 41:14.571
and what they say about the culture itself, how it demonstrates, how the Japanese do it differently, the Chinese, what they say about it.

41:16.995 --> 41:18.657
So all these types of issues.

41:18.677 --> 41:28.810
But building block-wise, the first building block I had or have was the Newbery Collection, and that was a collection which I bought through Justin

41:29.735 --> 41:31.157
had a chance to buy it much earlier.

41:31.177 --> 41:32.339
Is this the Newbury, the artist?

41:32.539 --> 41:34.122
No, John Newbury, the publisher.

41:34.162 --> 41:39.470
John Newbury, the Newbury of Woolworth.

41:39.530 --> 41:40.892
This was his own material?

41:41.693 --> 41:43.836
No, this was the material published by him.

41:43.856 --> 41:45.058
Oh, published by him.

41:45.078 --> 41:45.779
And his family.

41:47.061 --> 41:48.543
That must be a pretty nice collection.

41:49.565 --> 41:56.535
Well, I hope so, but it should be the most extensive, although when I started, it was already done.

41:57.342 --> 42:02.248
So the question was, could I do it better than the British Library?

42:02.488 --> 42:04.030
Because they got a command and everything.

42:04.050 --> 42:06.894
But there was enough stuff they didn't have.

42:06.914 --> 42:10.077
And so now it's fairly big.

42:10.718 --> 42:13.001
And I said, let's do a book on it.

42:13.862 --> 42:17.667
And the librarian is doing, as I say, on the woodcuts.

42:17.747 --> 42:19.769
And nobody's ever done the graphic aspect.

42:19.789 --> 42:20.911
This is your librarian?

42:21.011 --> 42:22.412
Andrea, Princeton.

42:22.432 --> 42:22.713
Oh, Andrea.

42:22.733 --> 42:22.853
Okay.

42:24.174 --> 42:24.615
So...

42:25.135 --> 42:29.482
That's out for, I guess, the editorial comments and stuff like that.

42:30.263 --> 42:31.785
So I'd like to see that book done.

42:31.805 --> 42:34.129
And who published that, Princeton University?

42:34.149 --> 42:35.371
I don't know yet.

42:35.391 --> 42:36.853
But that's the possibility.

42:36.873 --> 42:40.339
I've got three books that I'm working on.

42:40.359 --> 42:43.123
That you personally are working on or that you're supporting?

42:43.283 --> 42:50.575
One is the book, I'm going back next week to talk to Abrams about a book on folk art and textiles, my own collection.

42:50.735 --> 42:52.037
I've given them to Santa Fe and

42:52.270 --> 42:53.492
We're going to publish them.

42:53.512 --> 42:54.033
Santa Fe.

42:54.414 --> 42:57.880
The museum there, the National Folk Art.

42:57.900 --> 43:01.786
And I'm working on Japanese inkabana baskets, bamboo baskets.

43:01.806 --> 43:02.728
This is another collection.

43:02.748 --> 43:05.573
So you're a collector there.

43:05.793 --> 43:06.034
Yeah.

43:06.234 --> 43:08.338
Do you enjoy these things as artifacts?

43:08.358 --> 43:08.758
Yeah.

43:08.778 --> 43:09.940
I enjoy handling them.

43:09.960 --> 43:15.109
I've always enjoyed thinking about them, wondering who was it, why did it produce them.

43:15.129 --> 43:16.692
So...

43:17.262 --> 43:23.628
Was this thought always running through the final disposition of these things when you were acquiring them?

43:23.648 --> 43:25.430
I knew I was going to give them away.

43:27.092 --> 43:30.395
I'm in the process of giving everything away.

43:31.616 --> 43:37.021
I had 6,000 items in this one collection to give them that away.

43:37.181 --> 43:38.623
Of what?

43:38.643 --> 43:42.487
Of Japanese textiles and folk art.

43:42.507 --> 43:43.928
And what got you interested in that?

43:44.397 --> 43:46.140
I was in Japan for a couple of years.

43:46.180 --> 43:48.543
Again, this all comes from the archaeology background.

43:48.563 --> 43:50.546
No, that came from just going over there.

43:50.947 --> 43:59.179
I had taken a course in Chinese art and was fascinated by the landscape architecture and things like that.

43:59.199 --> 44:01.102
You continue to travel extensively?

44:01.403 --> 44:01.503
Yeah.

44:02.003 --> 44:04.467
Now, this is for pleasure.

44:04.487 --> 44:10.636
I mean, it's kind of quasi-pleasure, you know, travel for business and stuff.

44:10.656 --> 44:13.020
I go over for board meetings and things like that.

44:13.979 --> 44:35.059
so anyway just to give you an idea so Newbury is one and he was the first commercial publisher of children's books who did it who said hey children like entertainment more than catechism so let's go and he did he made it entertaining with cuts and with a different approach and I've

44:35.545 --> 44:36.967
again through Justin.

44:37.047 --> 44:40.973
Justin's been my Duveen, so to speak.

44:41.033 --> 44:43.016
So to speak, yeah.

44:43.036 --> 44:45.961
And... He's been Duveen for a number of major collections.

44:45.981 --> 44:46.842
Right, yeah.

44:46.862 --> 44:57.458
And I don't mind Duveen, you know, because I don't have time to be that smart or that knowledgeable, and he's... And I like him, so I learned.

44:57.478 --> 45:00.302
And he's very exceedingly knowledgeable as well.

45:00.322 --> 45:01.283
Yeah, right, that's what I said.

45:01.384 --> 45:02.786
And he cares about the collection himself.

45:02.806 --> 45:04.388
I mean, I think he takes as much...

45:04.790 --> 45:10.517
I tell him it's his collection, you know, and I'm happy to give him credit for it.

45:11.017 --> 45:15.783
And I told Prince I want him on the advisory board of that and have reelers on this.

45:16.364 --> 45:30.561
So does he suggest to you, I mean, would you say that the thinking of, this is a question I want to ask in terms of selection, I mean, I know you said that illustration plays a primary role in it,

45:31.013 --> 45:33.997
But there has to be more of a focus to it than that.

45:34.057 --> 45:35.359
Oh, yeah.

45:35.399 --> 45:36.822
So the Newbury thing was his.

45:37.182 --> 45:39.485
The second thing was Hans Christian Andersen.

45:40.447 --> 45:41.829
Now, they're already done.

45:41.849 --> 45:43.772
It can't be Copenhagen.

45:43.792 --> 45:48.058
It can't be the Library of Congress one.

45:48.078 --> 45:54.828
But there was a different aspect of doing it, of books published in his day and his own letters of work.

45:54.888 --> 46:00.396
So Justin accumulated that, and I bought it.

46:01.270 --> 46:09.098
And one, there's another one now that, Perot, the first... Oh, the Fables?

46:09.399 --> 46:09.519
Right.

46:09.539 --> 46:24.695
So we accumulated the colloquially, Justin, with help from me, put together the 100 Best Books of Perot and the Originals, which is a seven-figure collection.

46:26.097 --> 46:26.397
Wow.

46:26.497 --> 46:31.142
You personally have had to... So Perot is the first fairy tale story.

46:31.477 --> 46:32.879
Okay, so that's a third block.

46:32.979 --> 46:36.343
A fourth block, as I'm working on now, the brother Grimm.

46:37.064 --> 46:45.594
And again, it's been done, but what I'm looking at is what are the factors that are the Grimm's that made them do this?

46:45.614 --> 46:47.056
How did they come from family?

46:47.076 --> 46:48.157
What were the influences?

46:48.457 --> 46:49.719
So how do you determine that?

46:51.161 --> 46:52.422
Well, so I started doing it.

46:52.672 --> 46:54.835
All of a sudden, books came out of the woodwork.

46:55.116 --> 46:56.338
Pictures came out of the woodwork.

46:56.939 --> 47:01.546
I never learned, I never knew that there were three Brother Grimm's, and there were three Puro's.

47:02.707 --> 47:03.989
And each one went differently.

47:04.170 --> 47:07.154
And how come out of each family these people who were very instrumental?

47:08.076 --> 47:15.507
And then this book from Beasts of the Blondes, I don't know, Werner's book.

47:16.516 --> 47:17.137
Oh, I know.

47:17.778 --> 47:19.159
She's wonderful.

47:19.179 --> 47:21.722
Sexist, feminist, et cetera, looking at that.

47:21.742 --> 47:26.868
And looking at the Brothers Grimm's, how they do it through their own eyes of the period.

47:27.029 --> 47:28.090
And I think that is true.

47:28.731 --> 47:29.732
I don't think books are books.

47:29.812 --> 47:35.479
I think they're seen through the eyes of the person who was speaking, writing, et cetera.

47:36.260 --> 47:37.742
There are no facts.

47:39.924 --> 47:41.166
So, anyway, that's another one.

47:41.306 --> 47:42.287
I look at...

47:43.077 --> 47:44.980
my own kids, Bruno Minari.

47:45.000 --> 48:03.408
So I've collected all things by Bruno Minari, who's an Italian illustrator, comes out of the fascist period, goes through that in post-war, designs many things, designer, Italian, Milan, Milanese, designer.

48:04.009 --> 48:08.516
And I probably have as large a collection of his personal stuff as anybody.

48:08.536 --> 48:09.237
How do you spell his name?

48:09.537 --> 48:10.599
Minari.

48:10.619 --> 48:11.660
M-U-N-A-R-I.

48:11.921 --> 48:12.021
Okay.

48:12.355 --> 48:13.556
And was all the stuff kept you?

48:13.576 --> 48:15.938
You never had the books, kept the books at your house?

48:15.958 --> 48:16.399
Yeah, I had them here.

48:16.439 --> 48:17.760
Yeah, I had them at the house.

48:17.780 --> 48:21.724
So it wasn't the kind of... Until I got divorced.

48:21.744 --> 48:25.507
And then they sort of... I took them out of the house.

48:25.988 --> 48:41.923
Maybe not early enough, but... And then I'm now looking at the other...

48:42.241 --> 48:44.947
building blocks for the collection.

48:44.967 --> 48:49.416
Music is a building block for how children learn music, rhythms, et cetera.

48:49.797 --> 48:50.960
So I have bought it.

48:51.260 --> 48:59.618
Again, what Justin has said and what I do now is I don't have the time to put together a collection, buying one at a time.

49:00.600 --> 49:01.903
So I buy a collection.

49:02.710 --> 49:07.019
And I bought this as a basic block of children's stuff.

49:07.039 --> 49:10.366
So you're buying, like, Huntington many years before you.

49:10.386 --> 49:10.647
Yeah, right.

49:10.667 --> 49:17.321
And not only are you buying the books, you're buying the intelligence that went into the creation of that collection, too.

49:17.341 --> 49:17.922
Yeah, right.

49:17.942 --> 49:18.964
And that's worth something.

49:19.405 --> 49:19.846
It sure is.

49:19.926 --> 49:22.111
I'm happy to pay that premium.

49:22.251 --> 49:23.554
And then when you get it, do you...

49:24.412 --> 49:25.935
kind of immerse yourself into it?

49:25.955 --> 49:28.039
Or you have it and you go on to the next one?

49:28.620 --> 49:35.433
I'm wondering if the project, if the before my wife died, we used to read, I'd say, almost every book.

49:35.453 --> 49:38.399
Then it went down to every one out of three books.

49:38.419 --> 49:43.348
And today I don't read, you know, one out of a thousand, one out of a hundred books.

49:44.240 --> 49:46.222
So the project, it's the big picture.

49:48.025 --> 49:49.787
Right now I'm interested in creating.

49:49.807 --> 49:51.268
It comes in, you look at it, it's nice.

49:51.689 --> 49:52.710
You saw me just looking at it?

49:52.730 --> 49:55.934
Well, I only took a few notes because I thought that was interesting.

49:56.374 --> 49:57.776
And you're still quite actively.

49:58.057 --> 50:01.220
Going up the fair, you know, looking at it, picking them up.

50:01.701 --> 50:07.428
So once this thing is in place, you're not withdrawing necessarily.

50:07.468 --> 50:10.752
You will reserve the right, I guess, to continue.

50:10.772 --> 50:11.432
I'm still a prisoner.

50:11.533 --> 50:13.555
I will buy and...

50:13.889 --> 50:21.802
bother the librarian occasion, because sometimes I'll be indiscreet by someone and say, Lloyd, that isn't it with your guidelines?

50:22.063 --> 50:24.226
You know, I said, well, guidelines are just guidelines.

50:24.246 --> 50:25.568
Now, these guidelines are there, right?

50:25.629 --> 50:26.991
I'll be able to... I've set them up, yeah.

50:27.011 --> 50:28.634
Okay, but I'll be able to get out.

50:28.654 --> 50:30.857
I'm sure I'll be able to see this stuff.

50:30.877 --> 50:34.063
And were there some things you were going to give me here that I could look at tonight?

50:34.704 --> 50:34.944
Yeah.

50:36.366 --> 50:36.707
Uh...

50:43.758 --> 50:53.229
What I'm doing now is I'm not so much interested in the art.

50:53.649 --> 50:55.291
I try to stay away from original art.

50:55.872 --> 50:56.873
I do succumb.

50:57.373 --> 51:00.497
Beatrix Potter is another focus of mine.

51:00.537 --> 51:11.149
A very large Beatrix Potter collection, and I just bought her a lot of photo, and the British won't let it out of the country, I don't think, so there's a big conflict.

51:11.737 --> 51:14.521
I had that problem before, and I'm not sure what to do with it.

51:16.223 --> 51:21.691
And one publisher says, well, if we publish it, we'll let you get it out of the country.

51:27.179 --> 51:28.761
But I have our original material.

51:29.222 --> 51:32.286
Sendak also collects, you know, stuff like that as well.

51:33.087 --> 51:35.010
So we both collect from the same source.

51:36.020 --> 51:38.723
Has Justin brought you to see Betsy?

51:39.043 --> 51:39.644
Any of Betsy?

51:39.664 --> 51:40.284
I know Betsy.

51:40.304 --> 51:41.425
I was over her place.

51:41.485 --> 51:42.486
Betsy, I like very much.

51:42.807 --> 51:48.612
I've tried to stay away to not compete.

51:49.754 --> 51:50.534
She's American.

51:51.415 --> 51:57.441
Her stuff is American.

51:57.461 --> 52:02.466
Okay, Beatrix Potter material illustrates her genius in combining both storytelling and illustration.

52:02.834 --> 52:08.581
Hans Christian Andersen material, done in his lifetime, that gives some indication of his storytelling creativity.

52:09.082 --> 52:13.627
Perrault that records his importance in early recording of European fairy tales.

52:13.707 --> 52:22.038
Now I'm looking at Del Noir here, and Lady, who's equally important.

52:22.438 --> 52:29.567
The writings of the Grimm brothers and those who influenced them developing European folktales into a literary product and ultimately the basis of children's tales.

52:30.273 --> 52:37.245
The works of John Newberry and his descendants as it created a body of printed books for children that set the tone for education through amusement.

52:38.527 --> 52:41.932
Six, children's books on music that illustrate how children learn music.

52:42.313 --> 52:49.665
Seven, the good of the work of a contemporary designer and writer Bruno Monari as it pertained to the development of his children's books.

52:50.827 --> 53:02.700
Eight, early books that illustrate the process of childhood learning, how and what they learn primarily through their books, but with some additional attention to educational theory as underlying base in this.

53:03.821 --> 53:10.068
Outstanding creative examples of the union of graphics and print created to both educate and amuse children.

53:11.229 --> 53:16.394
Early graphic woodcuts and prints illustrating the relationship of the magister, the teacher, disciple.

53:17.015 --> 53:18.977
These are in Canabla things.

53:19.396 --> 53:25.509
and the occasionally unique artwork, work of art that was used in the educational learning process.

53:27.734 --> 53:36.072
And so, in short, the collection of content should provide a wealth of knowledge for research as to how and what children learn during the centuries where the written work

53:36.220 --> 53:39.264
And the printed image were primary tools in this process.

53:39.304 --> 53:41.266
Now, is this a talk that you gave?

53:41.286 --> 53:42.607
No, this is Scholes.

53:43.108 --> 53:44.530
This memo, Masturbation.

53:46.091 --> 53:51.678
This memo is a clarification of what the Coats and Library is aiming to do and who is doing what.

53:52.119 --> 53:55.623
And I'm trying to provide guidelines but not rules written and concrete.

53:55.643 --> 53:57.084
Can I have a copy of this by chance?

53:57.104 --> 53:57.665
You can read it.

53:57.745 --> 53:58.606
I don't know.

53:58.626 --> 54:04.573
I don't think it's... Not that there's a... I think it

54:05.245 --> 54:10.452
It lays out the roles of who does what and other people I've got, and I'll put the names on it, okay?

54:12.074 --> 54:14.177
And I'm sure there are people there you'll recognize.

54:15.939 --> 54:19.544
You'll continue to help shape the collection, both with funds and purchases.

54:19.885 --> 54:25.532
And you've got Justin in here, of course.

54:30.119 --> 54:33.863
So this is a growing library.

54:33.883 --> 54:41.632
Are you hopeful that other people might throw their stuff in as well?

54:41.772 --> 54:45.496
They can have their name in it, too.

54:45.516 --> 54:46.076
I don't have any.

54:51.242 --> 54:55.907
I'm building a museum that doesn't have my name on it.

54:58.891 --> 55:01.875
You're building a museum that doesn't have your name on it.

55:01.895 --> 55:03.297
Well, this one or...?

55:03.317 --> 55:04.439
No, no, not this one.

55:04.740 --> 55:05.160
Another one.

55:05.481 --> 55:06.442
And what is this other one?

55:06.622 --> 55:07.263
In Santa Fe.

55:09.126 --> 55:11.149
And this is the museum that you mentioned earlier, wasn't it?

55:11.169 --> 55:14.754
Yeah, and I've given the money and provided the stuff.

55:14.774 --> 55:17.939
So this has kind of become the focus of your life, hasn't it, I guess?

55:18.299 --> 55:24.408
I think education and some of these, a couple of projects I'd like to see through.

55:24.428 --> 55:27.733
And now my life is sort of

55:28.422 --> 55:30.925
focusing and shrinking to relationships.

55:31.606 --> 55:33.388
So I want to give some of the stuff away.

55:33.929 --> 55:50.949
You know, I think this is an hour, and toys, books and toys, educational toys, graphics, periodicals, ephemera.

55:50.969 --> 55:54.233
But I'm not interested in pedagogical material.

55:55.074 --> 55:57.417
I do have a few, like I have my illustrated toys.

55:58.173 --> 56:03.060
I want things that were in the child's hand or the child was exposed to.

56:03.281 --> 56:05.243
Not the teacher, but the child.

56:06.866 --> 56:09.510
Primary.

56:09.530 --> 56:11.693
There's enough of the pedagogical stuff around it.

56:11.713 --> 56:12.715
That's not my focus.

56:13.115 --> 56:21.187
So do you see this in any way supporting the curriculum immediately?

56:21.247 --> 56:25.193
I mean, are there courses that... They tell me at Princeton...

56:25.460 --> 56:39.001
that the collection, which isn't even out yet, the students are using the elements of it for their thesis, for other parts, both in history and economics, but for the Russians.

56:39.882 --> 56:45.470
I have Russian books of the NEP policy for children used in school.

56:46.612 --> 56:49.997
And, of course, even the exceedingly rare things, it doesn't bother you.

56:50.017 --> 56:53.863
Well, I think all the Chinese books published from 1980 to 1986.

56:54.367 --> 56:59.672
I figured nobody collects them, and they're being thrown away, pretty much.

56:59.772 --> 57:03.636
So I said, this is going to be important someday, as a period of— Sure.

57:03.816 --> 57:08.161
—between the Mao and— Now, where did you get that material?

57:09.222 --> 57:09.342
Japan.

57:09.362 --> 57:11.224
Right.

57:13.546 --> 57:21.534
I've been able to pick up Nazi Germany collections, and also how the American military government worked.

57:21.554 --> 57:24.357
First, they took over in 45, 46.

57:24.657 --> 57:28.722
They took over, and they kept the same permanence, but they eliminated all the pictures.

57:28.782 --> 57:30.544
And this is children's material again, right?

57:30.564 --> 57:37.053
They eliminated all the swastikas, et cetera, and all the pictures of Hitler.

57:37.073 --> 57:40.397
But they kept the same words, et cetera.

57:40.417 --> 57:44.722
So the concept of rarity is really irrelevant to you, isn't it?

57:44.802 --> 57:46.144
I'm not certain.

57:46.164 --> 57:48.727
The first editions are not that important to me.

57:50.129 --> 57:50.209
Hmm.

57:50.813 --> 57:57.262
Sometimes Justin says condition should be, but there'll be times you're not going to get a condition.

58:00.246 --> 58:03.591
I've lost... I don't know where stuff is.

58:03.611 --> 58:05.173
We're looking for a book.

58:06.275 --> 58:10.300
But you're acquiring for function.

58:10.340 --> 58:12.423
You're not acquiring for rarity.

58:13.905 --> 58:15.868
Justin would like me to acquire for rarity.

58:15.948 --> 58:17.891
I don't know.

58:17.931 --> 58:20.314
Do I acquire for rarity only...

58:20.969 --> 58:23.372
I try to encourage you to do that.

58:23.833 --> 58:27.158
Why do you encourage you to do that?

58:27.178 --> 58:30.082
She's a professional.

58:30.342 --> 58:32.125
Because he doesn't like to upgrade.

58:32.225 --> 58:34.148
He doesn't like to upgrade copies.

58:35.029 --> 58:43.260
And so I like him to get good copies in the first place so that I don't have to spend time.

58:43.621 --> 58:46.605
And now that he knows how much it costs to...

58:47.362 --> 58:59.198
To do formal cataloging of every single book, he should know why he should buy a nice copy from the first place, because it costs $40 to catalog them whether they're nice or not.

58:59.758 --> 59:04.364
But he's primarily acquiring for function as opposed to... Yeah, I know.

59:04.765 --> 59:12.475
Like there was a publisher was selling off all their file copies.

59:12.736 --> 59:13.116
Warrants.

59:13.754 --> 59:21.765
And I said, it'd be interesting to have their whole file as a document of what, for the 50 years, a children's book publisher was doing.

59:22.546 --> 59:24.269
You know, and then Princeton said it.

59:24.389 --> 59:27.273
Forty dollars a copy, you know.

59:27.293 --> 59:27.794
That's right.

59:28.455 --> 59:31.299
You know, there was a couple hundred thousand they would have to pay out.

59:31.319 --> 59:32.260
Just to catalog it.

59:32.620 --> 59:33.361
So they barked.

59:33.742 --> 59:34.884
They barked.

59:34.904 --> 59:35.905
And I could understand that.

59:35.925 --> 59:37.067
There was enough shelf space.

59:37.187 --> 59:43.035
On the other hand, I bought a children's book dealer's, all his personal papers.

59:43.370 --> 59:47.034
Well, that sounds fascinating, though.

59:47.054 --> 59:49.757
Okay, I said, someday somebody's going to look at that.

59:49.817 --> 59:50.538
Who was the dealer?

59:50.558 --> 59:51.599
Do you remember?

59:52.400 --> 59:57.206
Yeah, Victoria Bookshop in New York.

59:57.226 --> 59:57.806
Okay, I'll check it out.

59:57.826 --> 59:59.969
Used to be a cigar smoker.

59:59.989 --> 01:00:02.872
A woman?

01:00:02.892 --> 01:00:04.093
Nice man, Milt Reisman.

01:00:07.317 --> 01:00:10.220
When I open the stuff, I can smell the cigars.

01:00:10.901 --> 01:00:11.842
Isn't that great?

01:00:11.862 --> 01:00:11.942
Wow.

01:00:12.496 --> 01:00:15.821
Yeah, I would have bought Schatzky's, except I was too young at the time and not focused.

01:00:16.542 --> 01:00:17.484
Schatzky's files.

01:00:17.664 --> 01:00:18.245
Yeah.

01:00:18.265 --> 01:00:19.727
Well, those things were very useful.

01:00:19.967 --> 01:00:24.094
I used Rosenbach's files in my book, and that stuff was invented.

01:00:24.114 --> 01:00:26.477
Oh, these are slips and invoices and stuff.

01:00:26.497 --> 01:00:36.893
Yeah, but to tell you what people paid, what things were... At UCLA here, when I first went to work out here, down at Ocean Park, there was a guy who had a bookstore who used copies.

01:00:37.114 --> 01:00:37.695
I used to go in.

01:00:37.715 --> 01:00:39.938
I had a double entendre book collection.

01:00:40.508 --> 01:00:48.741
Like The Captain's Fags or Out Without My Rubbers or things like that, which were books for 25 cents, but you couldn't.

01:00:48.781 --> 01:00:53.609
The Cockhouse of Felsgar, you know, it's a biblical track book.

01:00:53.629 --> 01:00:55.993
But it has like a cute collection.

01:00:56.113 --> 01:00:56.914
What did you do with that?

01:00:57.014 --> 01:00:57.455
You still have that?

01:00:57.535 --> 01:00:59.218
That I kept.

01:00:59.238 --> 01:01:03.204
And Easy French Dishes, which was a cookbook.

01:01:03.665 --> 01:01:03.765
Yeah.

01:01:04.252 --> 01:01:06.374
How many titles in that?

01:01:07.175 --> 01:01:07.996
Slightly under a hundred.

01:01:08.317 --> 01:01:10.279
I don't want to have more than a hundred, so I have to throw some more.

01:01:10.299 --> 01:01:11.821
Can you think of any others off the top?

01:01:12.722 --> 01:01:18.829
Oh, um, let's see.

01:01:19.590 --> 01:01:22.853
Outdoor Girls in the South.

01:01:22.873 --> 01:01:24.836
Right, Outdoor Girls in the South, right.

01:01:24.856 --> 01:01:25.917
I've seen the collection.

01:01:26.718 --> 01:01:28.740
Outdoor Girls in the South, that's great.

01:01:29.716 --> 01:01:35.521
And all these books had to cost 25 cents, and you could not open the cover, in other words, a gambler.

01:01:35.742 --> 01:01:44.450
Anyway, this guy had this whole collection of old books, and he was, I don't know, I thought he was old, but he was probably in his late 60s and 70s.

01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:51.896
And as I, during much time, I'd go across the street and just browse, and that's where I saw these funny, and the titles sort of got me thinking.

01:01:51.917 --> 01:01:53.958
And I bet you can't even think of who the authors are.

01:01:53.978 --> 01:01:56.080
The authors are so, they're just totally irrelevant.

01:01:56.140 --> 01:01:57.221
Irrelevant, right.

01:01:58.623 --> 01:01:58.963
And...

01:01:59.348 --> 01:02:02.913
UCLA went in and bought the whole bookshop.

01:02:03.714 --> 01:02:09.923
So they would have a sample collection of what a bookshop in the 60s was, a used bookshop.

01:02:11.024 --> 01:02:11.445
Is it?

01:02:11.525 --> 01:02:12.366
That's something.

01:02:13.027 --> 01:02:13.628
Who did that?

01:02:13.668 --> 01:02:14.690
David Zeigberg?

01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:16.092
No, before Zeigberg.

01:02:18.134 --> 01:02:19.416
He's over at the Huntington's.

01:02:19.436 --> 01:02:24.183
So I try to have some of that perspective, you know.

01:02:25.144 --> 01:02:28.709
Newer, oh, it doesn't make too much difference.

01:02:28.729 --> 01:02:29.170
Uh...

01:02:36.203 --> 01:02:38.957
This is stuff that's being repaired or filed.
