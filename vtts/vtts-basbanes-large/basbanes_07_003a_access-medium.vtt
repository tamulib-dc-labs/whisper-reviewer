WEBVTT

00:02.630 --> 00:09.980
Once in my presence and once when you sit down with your diaper.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.021
Tell me again what this room is.

00:11.822 --> 00:14.206
We call this collection development.

00:14.366 --> 00:24.119
As individuals who have an interest in an author who really don't have the time to pursue or to choose not to build the collections themselves, they'll say, I don't know who we have here.

00:24.139 --> 00:25.421
This is the Conrad collection.

00:25.441 --> 00:26.202
I started with somebody.

00:26.562 --> 00:28.625
The gentleman said, I want all the first of Conrad.

00:29.006 --> 00:31.269
So as we find acceptable copies, we know they're sold.

00:31.309 --> 00:32.350
We put them aside for them.

00:32.566 --> 00:38.315
I would say it represents a small percentage of my customers, but it's probably the wealthier percentage.

00:38.515 --> 00:45.847
I think it takes the fun out of it, but because I'm in business to sell books, I'm open-minded enough that I'm not going to say, well, I'm not going to do it.

00:45.867 --> 00:48.591
I'm going to say, I'll help you in any way I can because I wish to accommodate it.

00:48.611 --> 00:50.935
Describe again this collection here.

00:50.955 --> 00:59.248
This is part of actually a client who came in with his wife who was married 21 years and gave me 21 authors.

00:59.532 --> 01:04.396
build complete collections of first editions with no budget, which is the best way to build it.

01:04.416 --> 01:04.817
No budget.

01:04.837 --> 01:06.478
This is a Beverly Hills person?

01:06.939 --> 01:10.422
Yeah, it's a Los Angeles person, who's very well-known, who I can't mention.

01:11.022 --> 01:17.748
But unfortunately, I can't, because he's certainly one of the wealthiest people in the world.

01:17.788 --> 01:23.653
Believe it or not, we can't even use his name in the shop.

01:23.733 --> 01:27.717
I have about six customers who I only could use by cold, even in the shop.

01:27.983 --> 01:29.145
I mean, I would use an issue.

01:29.165 --> 01:29.887
It's called I.I.

01:30.608 --> 01:31.229
This is I.I.'

01:31.209 --> 01:31.630
's collection.

01:31.670 --> 01:35.819
We have some people who actually say, you do not have permission to ever use my name.

01:36.039 --> 01:37.542
He's one of them.

01:37.983 --> 01:39.145
But he just started collecting them.

01:39.185 --> 01:39.907
No, he never collected them.

01:39.927 --> 01:41.450
He's only been in my shop once.

01:41.710 --> 01:42.853
I'll never see him again, I'm sure.

01:42.873 --> 01:43.795
He's collecting.

01:43.815 --> 01:44.616
Yeah, I'm collecting.

01:44.636 --> 01:47.983
I get all the fun, get the profits, and sometimes I get to keep the books go off.

01:49.398 --> 01:54.325
I have books I'll buy for customers, and it'll be two years before they'll pick it up.

01:54.365 --> 02:00.314
They'll say, I'm building a library already in two years, and when it's finished, you send me everything, you know?

02:03.238 --> 02:05.862
Can you tell me who some of the authors are?

02:05.902 --> 02:07.624
Yeah.

02:07.644 --> 02:09.607
Well, actually, we only have 13 of them down so far.

02:09.627 --> 02:19.101
It's Austin, Bronte, Trollope, Dickens, Edith Wharton, strangely enough, John Steinbeck, Henry James,

02:19.520 --> 02:29.560
George Eliot was going to be all British.

02:29.600 --> 02:31.323
No, it wasn't.

02:31.424 --> 02:34.329
Actually, the Americans are... It's just a matter of personal taste.

02:37.135 --> 02:38.979
You can sit back there if you like.

02:38.999 --> 02:39.199
Sure.

02:39.736 --> 02:41.958
A coffee or something?

02:41.978 --> 02:46.462
If you're going to have some, we'll have some, but nothing... I'd love some coffee, because I've been running around a little bit.

02:46.483 --> 02:48.104
We'd love some too, actually.

02:48.124 --> 02:48.284
Okay.

02:48.304 --> 02:49.225
Are you sure?

02:49.285 --> 02:49.806
Is that your show?

02:49.826 --> 02:51.287
Yeah, she'd like some.

02:51.547 --> 02:52.428
Are you two together?

02:53.810 --> 02:55.131
Let's talk a little bit about it.

02:55.171 --> 03:04.560
Well, I think there's something sad about it, though, in that we've been in business 27 years, and when we started out in Hollywood Boulevard, there were 22 bookshops here.

03:04.580 --> 03:08.764
That's where used and answering books there is one left.

03:09.233 --> 03:20.912
They're all closing up because in all large cities in the United States, and it's probably true in England too, there's a reduced number of retail spaces for small businesses because commercial rent has gotten so high.

03:20.992 --> 03:24.818
Excuse me, this is Bruce Kittrick, and he's looking, he wanted to look at the early books.

03:24.958 --> 03:26.140
No charge to look, good to see you.

03:26.561 --> 03:26.881
Nice to see you.

03:26.901 --> 03:28.564
If you don't mind us chatting, you go right ahead.

03:28.644 --> 03:29.726
I didn't want to interrupt, so that's fine.

03:29.786 --> 03:31.729
I haven't said anything interesting in almost two years.

03:32.310 --> 03:32.791
Great.

03:33.212 --> 03:35.575
Well, we could exchange woody letters at this rate, huh?

03:35.616 --> 03:35.916
Right.

03:36.470 --> 03:41.402
Just go through there, or you can peek through the safe if you want afterwards, have some incunables in there.

03:41.422 --> 03:42.425
Oh, okay, great.

03:42.445 --> 03:44.951
And it's strictly arranged according to the position on the shelf.

03:44.971 --> 03:48.640
Well, we put it according to size these days and color, I think.

03:48.660 --> 03:48.760
Okay.

03:48.781 --> 03:50.685
And we think that people keep mixing it up.

03:50.765 --> 03:53.432
As a Samuel Peach, everything is by size.

03:53.952 --> 03:54.373
That's right.

03:54.393 --> 03:54.853
Remember that?

03:55.114 --> 03:56.876
I went up there by April.

03:57.277 --> 03:58.739
It was fascinating.

03:59.139 --> 04:04.467
So it started in 1963 when we started.

04:04.727 --> 04:15.362
But the point I was trying to make is that there's a reduced number of entrepreneurial jobs because there's not the inventory to support them anymore.

04:15.382 --> 04:16.804
It's not so much the clients.

04:16.824 --> 04:19.588
You can't cultivate clients if you don't have inventory.

04:20.092 --> 04:21.594
And so this is how I see it.

04:22.135 --> 04:29.044
This has probably nothing to do with anything in my own perception or things, but it's my brief.

04:29.064 --> 04:37.035
There are fewer and fewer antiquarian booksellers, but you can't start out in the business because you have no place to start with an inventory, right?

04:37.055 --> 04:38.216
You mean certainly in a city?

04:38.497 --> 04:39.218
Yeah, in a city.

04:39.238 --> 04:46.808
Well, actually, as a whole, most people who go into the used or antiquarian book business really go into books that are available, which is modern literature,

04:47.108 --> 04:49.171
which is what is findable.

04:49.532 --> 04:54.780
Children's books, which is very visual, or art books, which are visual, but it's primarily 20th century.

04:55.280 --> 04:57.664
It's so difficult to obtain.

04:57.884 --> 05:00.949
And you can find this on the institutional level.

05:01.610 --> 05:02.071
Oh, yeah.

05:02.091 --> 05:09.582
When Texas wanted to start a major collection, they decided to focus on the 20th century, because all the great stuff is gone.

05:09.943 --> 05:10.784
Sure.

05:11.525 --> 05:15.411
And they were smart to do it, because they did it at the time when it was there, and today it's gone.

05:15.830 --> 05:18.012
I mean, you went to the Humanities Research Center?

05:18.032 --> 05:18.112
Yep.

05:18.232 --> 05:18.853
Extraordinary.

05:18.933 --> 05:23.016
It's so overwhelming, though, when you see 13 copies of Ulysses in First Division.

05:23.076 --> 05:24.077
It's more than that, I think.

05:24.117 --> 05:27.760
Well, when I was there five years ago, they had 13 out of 100 copies.

05:27.841 --> 05:29.042
Now they have 19 or something?

05:29.062 --> 05:30.523
I don't know what it is.

05:30.543 --> 05:34.126
I said 41, and Tom Stanley said, well, not quite.

05:34.286 --> 05:36.748
Well, 41 out of 100 would be really unlikely.

05:36.848 --> 05:37.389
It's in the 20s.

05:37.409 --> 05:37.929
Yeah.

05:38.230 --> 05:40.732
Well, they don't buy those copies, though, I don't think.

05:41.172 --> 05:42.153
Yeah, they do.

05:42.674 --> 05:43.935
I mean, they wouldn't continue to.

05:43.955 --> 05:45.516
You could never sell them that book today.

05:46.087 --> 05:49.070
They basically, I don't think they bought them mindfully.

05:49.090 --> 05:50.471
They were buying in such large lines.

05:50.491 --> 05:51.672
Well, I think they were buying collections.

05:51.692 --> 05:53.934
They were buying collections in the net kind of .

05:54.074 --> 05:58.738
And every important literature collection had to have the first edition of Ulysses in it, because that's a cornerstone book.

05:58.758 --> 06:00.219
So what happened is they had .

06:00.540 --> 06:07.286
And the sad part about it is that they have poor policies in deacquisitioning, for letting go of this material.

06:07.386 --> 06:08.967
A lot of that has to do with the statewide.

06:09.067 --> 06:10.568
It's kind of like selling a snow plow.

06:10.729 --> 06:11.930
They have to get bids and all that.

06:11.950 --> 06:13.471
I think there are different stories about it.

06:13.511 --> 06:15.773
I mean, Huntington Library, for years,

06:16.107 --> 06:21.132
had, when Cary Bliss was there, had a department that, it was like, they ran a bookshop.

06:21.152 --> 06:22.593
I got the catalogs.

06:22.653 --> 06:26.056
No, they had actually, Cary Bliss, well, he used to do Little Lists, that's right.

06:26.076 --> 06:29.580
I mean, I've got the Huntington Library catalogs, which is deaccessioning.

06:29.840 --> 06:30.781
Right.

06:30.901 --> 06:33.504
Yeah, but I used to buy wonderful things.

06:33.684 --> 06:34.384
Maybe recently.

06:34.524 --> 06:42.452
Oh, no, this is Cary Bliss, it's been five years since, seven years, probably, since I've gotten anything, but 15 or 20 years ago, I used to go there, like a bookshop, and

06:42.837 --> 06:43.942
It was wonderful.

06:44.444 --> 06:47.577
So you've been a bookman for 27 years.

06:48.139 --> 06:50.248
Tell me a little bit how you got into this business.

06:50.268 --> 06:51.292
What did you do before this?

06:51.775 --> 06:53.100
I had a newspaper route.

06:53.485 --> 07:00.536
Yeah, I laugh about that because I put that on a bank application form recently, and they insisted you had to put down two jobs.

07:00.917 --> 07:02.259
And I said, well, I've always had the same job.

07:02.279 --> 07:03.180
I said, sir, it says two.

07:03.200 --> 07:04.182
You have to put down your last job.

07:04.222 --> 07:06.045
So I put newspaper up, you know.

07:06.065 --> 07:10.071
And this was, I think I was applying for a loan for a house or something.

07:10.131 --> 07:13.256
And nobody ever questioned me about it because nobody actually reads the second line.

07:13.296 --> 07:15.259
You know, it's like putting down your closest relatives.

07:15.319 --> 07:16.321
Nobody wants to call them.

07:17.442 --> 07:21.028
But I've always, I got out of high school, and

07:21.413 --> 07:32.644
opened a used bookshop in Compton, which is primarily a black area, completely illiterate, and all I did was acquire an enormous quantity of books with no customers.

07:33.264 --> 07:34.506
You were acquired in that area?

07:34.746 --> 07:47.658
Well, we did because most of the people in the area were maintenance people, and they would go to Beverly Hills clean houses and hallway books and other things and sell everything else, and they couldn't sell the books, and since we were in Compton, we were buying these books for a nickel apiece.

07:47.678 --> 07:49.260
Did you build a pretty good stock that way?

07:49.730 --> 07:52.414
If you're impressed with Connelly, we had a wonderful stock.

07:52.894 --> 07:55.157
We had the world's largest collection of Peter's Digest.

07:56.099 --> 07:57.320
Great.

07:57.340 --> 07:59.003
You probably still have it.

07:59.043 --> 08:01.306
No, we've since disposed of it.

08:01.326 --> 08:06.353
But we had, in Connelly, we had an enormous stock, but they were not books that had any value on it.

08:06.373 --> 08:10.318
How do you explain the transformation from that to this?

08:10.338 --> 08:10.859
No, it's interesting.

08:10.879 --> 08:13.082
It's usually one of the most extraordinary book stories I've seen.

08:13.302 --> 08:13.703
Well, thank you.

08:13.723 --> 08:16.767
But it's essential to me to learn

08:17.776 --> 08:20.945
in order to understand what's really valuable, to learn what's plentiful.

08:21.507 --> 08:29.190
And through the process of dealing with news books and more plentiful books, I think you get a better grasp of what is uncommon.

08:29.210 --> 08:31.617
And it's through our experience of

08:32.018 --> 08:37.123
of recognizing that we see things infrequently, we make our own judgments.

08:37.163 --> 08:42.028
Because, you know, pricing is really so subjective, as you're obviously aware at this point, I would think.

08:42.048 --> 08:45.732
You know, you'll see six copies of the books from $200 to $2,000.

08:46.433 --> 08:55.942
Conceivably, they could all be priced intelligently if the specifics on them are accurate, or one is complete or incomplete, or association, or whatever.

08:56.903 --> 08:58.385
But what is your question?

09:00.007 --> 09:01.468
You're doing very well.

09:01.820 --> 09:14.455
I guess I was asking if you could, if you're clearing your home mind, how you went from... Oh, there's a... ...the four neighborhoods where people couldn't read to this one extreme or the other.

09:14.535 --> 09:26.409
Could not say that one event, it's the right position in that we were... had a very limited overhead, so we weren't concerned.

09:26.429 --> 09:29.633
My brother and I were single for the first six years of our business,

09:29.967 --> 09:33.712
We shared a room for $60 a month and we actually didn't know we were working.

09:33.732 --> 09:36.315
We thought we were having a great time pursuing a hobby.

09:36.636 --> 09:43.384
We were working seven days a week and we worked every night and finally one of us got married and we started working every other night and I felt like I was unemployed.

09:44.185 --> 09:48.531
Because when you're used to that kind of schedule it completely changes.

09:48.571 --> 09:54.979
But I think what made it so easy is that we never felt like we were going to work.

09:55.668 --> 09:57.431
It has to be more than hard work.

09:57.612 --> 09:59.174
You had to receive the market.

09:59.194 --> 10:04.484
You had to do something to go from... I think there really is an enormous time period.

10:04.504 --> 10:07.369
Put it another way, you mentioned there were 22 to 24 stores.

10:08.131 --> 10:14.402
It can't just be an attrition that you're the only one who remains, or one of the few who remains.

10:14.669 --> 10:41.487
somebody said you know uh you know you guys have really always been very lucky and i said you know the amazing thing is the harder we work the luckier we get you know that's how i feel that i really feel that we put a lot of years in the last few years i've been about lazy though i haven't really uh put out a lot of energy the summers i take half the summers off and i have a family with the children and uh my energies are directed elsewhere now but uh i really i mean i i'm really committed to my business

10:41.939 --> 10:44.061
I've called you, by the way.

10:44.081 --> 10:46.905
Let's see, what year is this?

10:47.225 --> 10:47.986
This is a 90.

10:48.727 --> 10:50.248
God, that's depressing.

10:50.468 --> 10:52.291
There's a reason for my asking the question.

10:52.931 --> 11:00.359
I've noticed that going to these sales, particularly, that there is really a new generation of bookseller, of which you are up to.

11:00.420 --> 11:10.070
I mean, there are still, well, Jake Zeigler now, of course, is gone, and you still see a Dave Kirschbaum, and then you see a Rostenberg and a Stern.

11:10.170 --> 11:10.731
Yeah, great.

11:10.998 --> 11:13.542
and 70s and 80s, but there is a gap.

11:14.003 --> 11:18.630
But there's a group of young things, and I'm young, I'm mid-40s myself, so I'm saying young.

11:18.650 --> 11:26.683
But there is really a gap when you think about it, because I think there are relatively few booksellers from 50 to 65 than there are plus 65 and under 45.

11:26.763 --> 11:33.934
A new emerging generation, which is really playing the game smartly, I mean, with aggressiveness, with style.

11:34.454 --> 11:40.820
I see you guys play at the... Well, I think there are more businessmen out there now than there used to be, I'll tell you that.

11:40.880 --> 11:42.782
And those are the ones that have survived to a certain extent.

11:42.802 --> 11:43.603
Tell me a little bit about that.

11:43.643 --> 11:46.866
Are you a businessman first and a bookman second?

11:46.906 --> 11:54.674
Well, I hate to acknowledge this, to tell you the truth, but I really feel that if I wasn't in the book business, I'd be incredibly rich.

11:54.954 --> 11:59.719
I weren't in the book business because I'm in a business that deals in a product that's not replaceable.

12:00.037 --> 12:01.879
And I'm a reasonably good salesperson.

12:01.919 --> 12:05.564
You're being very modest, but I'm told you're the most successful bookseller in the United States.

12:05.804 --> 12:08.988
And that is so pathetic, because it's such a small business.

12:09.008 --> 12:09.669
Is it true, do you think?

12:10.249 --> 12:17.999
Well, I think that considering that we made our money in the book business, and our part of living in the book business, we're probably... I think that maybe we are.

12:18.019 --> 12:19.220
I never stopped to think about it.

12:19.721 --> 12:24.947
I think that we certainly went through a greater transition than any other bookseller.

12:25.214 --> 12:28.499
seller, and maybe that's what has allowed it to happen.

12:28.519 --> 12:45.984
But I really think the formative years were essential in order to get to... Was there a dramatic jump from where... Or was it just... We didn't fall into a great collection or... There was no one single event that I think that really made a significant difference.

12:46.004 --> 12:48.948
I think humanistically, it happened.

12:49.629 --> 12:53.635
But if I relied on one thing on one customer, which is always a scary thing to me because

12:54.408 --> 13:01.159
It's very transitionary in that everybody has a good customer for a while, but the question is how long will they be there?

13:01.479 --> 13:11.155
Because ultimately they either run out of interest or they run out of money or more often interest because they're five, ten years they're worth books, fifteen years, but then they pick up other things.

13:11.215 --> 13:15.522
People who are collectors of art tend to drift from coins to stamps to books to art.

13:15.882 --> 13:16.744
That's how I find it.

13:17.044 --> 13:22.052
And a lot of them maybe they keep a basic interest, but if you don't have material to

13:22.454 --> 13:25.457
feed them, to supply them, that they're apt to gift.

13:25.577 --> 13:27.679
And that's why we're sort of aggressive in buying.

13:27.699 --> 13:33.645
We feel that you can't really maintain and cultivate a clientele unless you really have something to offer.

13:33.665 --> 13:36.248
How do you... I've got so many questions to ask of you.

13:36.348 --> 13:41.413
You're just raising so many good ones, but you... I know you haven't written down anything interesting to me.

13:42.114 --> 13:43.195
I'm following here.

13:44.276 --> 13:45.577
It's pretty small to have so much.

13:47.979 --> 13:51.583
You said that you are an aggressive person when it comes to

13:51.817 --> 13:55.581
Well, I'm glad that I'm subtle about it, but I think I'm aggressive.

13:55.621 --> 13:59.024
How do you identify things that you want to require?

13:59.705 --> 14:02.708
Well, see, I go slightly different.

14:03.189 --> 14:08.574
I pursue anything that appears to be an opportunity, in that I don't look for specific kinds of books.

14:08.674 --> 14:13.339
I look for books that are unusually valuable in any field, or manuscript material.

14:13.960 --> 14:17.303
And if you have enough... When I say books, I'm including the bribe... Yeah, right.

14:17.423 --> 14:19.225
But once you have the material,

14:19.424 --> 14:20.705
you could develop an interest.

14:20.885 --> 14:23.668
Of course, through my own enthusiasm, I'm really selling.

14:23.988 --> 14:28.292
Most of the things I sell to people, most of the time, they never heard of it, you know, half the time.

14:28.952 --> 14:31.995
Because of my own enthusiasm, I can pass that on.

14:32.455 --> 14:44.706
Now, if I say something I believe is really uncommon or rare, I mean, I wouldn't say it unless I believed it, and I could share that with people who I've developed a relationship with, and that's how I could develop customers' interests.

14:44.726 --> 14:47.929
You have already demonstrated...

14:48.196 --> 14:55.687
very commendably how discreet you are in protecting the identity of your clients, and I thoroughly respect that.

14:56.028 --> 14:59.073
But I wonder if you can distribute an idea.

14:59.093 --> 15:12.553
We are certainly in West Los Angeles, half a block or so from Beverly Hills, and I would imagine that you have an unusual kind of client base.

15:13.034 --> 15:13.174
Mm-hmm.

15:13.930 --> 15:14.391
I do.

15:15.212 --> 15:16.774
There are two kinds of people out there.

15:16.794 --> 15:21.481
Actually, our business has changed in the last five years, so it's a little deceptive.

15:21.661 --> 15:24.545
I'm much more gift-oriented now than ever before.

15:24.626 --> 15:28.872
I'd say 30% of my sales are not for the people who walk out with the book.

15:29.553 --> 15:34.860
And it used to be... Well, that's how I set up my shop, though.

15:35.702 --> 15:37.825
I want to make it sort of an experience.

15:37.845 --> 15:40.849
You drag somebody here, and they buy a book for somebody else.

15:41.234 --> 15:44.037
But I would say, well, I'm guessing at 30%.

15:44.217 --> 15:46.879
I know it's a much larger percentage than it's ever been.

15:47.480 --> 15:52.084
And we're always constantly sending things as gifts for people.

15:52.144 --> 16:01.612
So you might have a woman come in and say, you know my husband's collection.

16:01.853 --> 16:02.753
Why don't you sit down with us, Ben?

16:02.773 --> 16:03.514
We'll just check the way.

16:04.235 --> 16:06.016
So you become something of an advisor.

16:06.197 --> 16:07.017
Well, not so much.

16:07.157 --> 16:10.060
Well, we have to have an understanding

16:10.613 --> 16:13.737
of what we've sold people.

16:13.797 --> 16:13.998
Right.

16:14.058 --> 16:15.960
And we have a better idea of using it.

16:16.060 --> 16:17.643
But I think he'd love this.

16:17.663 --> 16:21.227
I don't know what he... It's not always for a relative, though.

16:21.247 --> 16:23.971
I just offer that as an example.

16:24.292 --> 16:27.256
But is that the kind of thing that happens, I wonder?

16:27.456 --> 16:28.017
Absolutely.

16:28.177 --> 16:35.787
I'm just saying we probably sell books or rare books as a gift item more often than most people in this business.

16:35.967 --> 16:36.368
That's all.

16:36.770 --> 16:37.571
much harder.

16:37.591 --> 16:41.434
Wouldn't you say, I'd say 25, 30% of others might well be gift items.

16:41.454 --> 16:42.115
Very possible.

16:42.175 --> 16:43.256
I mean, it's surprising.

16:43.296 --> 16:46.619
By the way, this is Ben talking all over here, and this is Lou.

16:46.819 --> 16:47.440
Hello, machine.

16:49.261 --> 16:50.643
This is for the benefit of my typist.

16:53.866 --> 16:56.628
We were just talking about the nature.

16:56.668 --> 16:57.429
I guess I'm interested.

16:57.569 --> 17:05.376
I've heard it stated by a number of people, a number of dealers, as a matter of fact, East Coast dealers, and maybe it's solid grapes on their part.

17:05.828 --> 17:34.080
but it is suggested that the real action in book selling today is out here well thank you and i don't mean just i don't mean just in this building but i mean in the west coast i've heard it said before but i've always heard that the grass is greener on the other side of the fence i guarantee you from their perspective i can see how they might think that because people who are out of town have a tendency to like to save on uh taxes and things of that sort if it's being shipped out of state

17:34.617 --> 17:36.141
They certainly wouldn't have to pay a tax.

17:36.182 --> 17:39.932
So maybe we sell a lot of our books out of state, and they also sell a lot of them.

17:39.952 --> 17:40.895
Don't believe for a second.

17:40.915 --> 17:46.592
If we didn't take this bookshop and move it to New York City or Philadelphia, then we wouldn't be a very successful business.

17:46.612 --> 17:47.494
You think so?

17:47.635 --> 17:49.099
How many inventories have you seen like this?

17:49.484 --> 17:50.645
I haven't seen any like this.

17:50.665 --> 17:53.468
Well, the reason is because you have to have the inventory to get the people.

17:53.568 --> 17:56.871
Yeah, but you have to do the business to get the wherewithal to build the inventory.

17:56.951 --> 18:01.275
No, I know, but I'm saying... You just told me you sold a three-quarter of a million dollar library.

18:01.315 --> 18:02.156
Built a library, yes.

18:02.176 --> 18:04.759
That's a pretty significant sale.

18:04.899 --> 18:07.421
There are people all over the country with that kind of funds available.

18:07.481 --> 18:09.143
All over the country.

18:09.203 --> 18:16.470
I don't know how many booksellers... I spoke to a bookseller this morning who's made that kind of... I spoke to a bookseller this morning who had somebody walk in the first time and spend $125,000.

18:17.108 --> 18:21.374
Well, it was an English book, so I sent them there.

18:21.534 --> 18:22.055
An American?

18:22.135 --> 18:23.017
An American, yeah.

18:23.617 --> 18:25.280
But I mean, this guy who lives in Philadelphia.

18:25.821 --> 18:28.424
It depends on the type of custom history of culture.

18:28.605 --> 18:30.948
We've been in the book business 27 years.

18:30.988 --> 18:33.532
We've really established a reputation for ourselves.

18:33.592 --> 18:35.775
Lou and I have both worked extremely hard.

18:36.312 --> 18:38.916
have a pulse of what's going on in the book business.

18:38.956 --> 18:40.338
We travel to all the auctions.

18:40.358 --> 18:41.559
We go to all the book fairs.

18:41.579 --> 18:46.646
I'm not suggesting it's not fortuitous that we're close to Beverly Hills where there are obviously a lot of rich people.

18:46.827 --> 18:47.668
We can't overlook that.

18:48.148 --> 18:53.276
If we move this to Alabama, it would be a long time before we're living the kind of life we'd like to live.

18:53.296 --> 18:56.340
Well, I think we're talking major metropolitan areas.

18:56.440 --> 19:00.826
But let me rephrase the question.

19:01.587 --> 19:05.172
One of these, Marcia McGee-Cardiff, as she said,

19:06.080 --> 19:07.582
for the record, which is a while I'll repeat it.

19:08.163 --> 19:08.763
Who's this?

19:08.783 --> 19:09.745
Marsha Carter.

19:09.865 --> 19:10.606
She's Larry McMurch.

19:10.686 --> 19:11.126
Oh, yeah.

19:11.227 --> 19:11.587
Oh, sure.

19:11.807 --> 19:12.368
Nice woman.

19:12.628 --> 19:15.752
And she said, it's all out.

19:16.573 --> 19:23.482
Anyone who doesn't realize that the book trade, the book business is really happening on the West Coast is not watching what's going on.

19:23.883 --> 19:25.985
They all claim they'd be better out here when they do fairs.

19:26.566 --> 19:28.889
She said, but the quote was, it's a wonderful quote.

19:28.909 --> 19:29.550
And I said, well, why?

19:29.610 --> 19:30.912
I said, there's money in the East Coast.

19:30.932 --> 19:31.572
Who are we kidding?

19:31.593 --> 19:35.918
I mean, I've seen Bob Peary spend big bucks at the Bradley Martin sale and others.

19:36.505 --> 19:37.206
And so have you.

19:37.446 --> 19:39.308
And we know who some of the players are.

19:39.328 --> 19:40.789
They come from all over the United States.

19:41.090 --> 19:43.973
She said, newer money is happier money is freer money.

19:44.053 --> 19:46.195
That's a wonderful quote.

19:47.116 --> 19:47.556
I delight.

19:47.717 --> 19:50.960
And I wonder if you would agree with that.

19:51.200 --> 19:55.405
Do you think that maybe that there is happier money out here, more disposable money?

19:55.625 --> 19:59.289
You know, it's not nine generations in the family.

19:59.349 --> 20:05.415
I'm sure that has something to do with it, but I really feel...

20:05.682 --> 20:08.486
We, to a certain extent, take credit for that.

20:09.067 --> 20:14.815
There are a lot of customers here because we have worked with a lot of those people over the last 25 years and developed that interest.

20:14.975 --> 20:19.281
We believe if there weren't good shops to get the interest started, those customers would never be there.

20:19.782 --> 20:27.754
I think if you put some of the other books that was there who didn't have the aggressiveness that we had, you would not have had some of the customers that we've developed.

20:27.774 --> 20:34.423
And those customers, the customer that went out to London and spent $125,000, he started out over here through our enthusiasm and then we worked with him.

20:34.876 --> 20:37.839
So I think that... I'm curious, why did you send the customers to England?

20:37.859 --> 20:38.880
You couldn't get them what he wanted?

20:38.901 --> 20:40.382
No, I didn't actually send them.

20:40.642 --> 20:44.206
He went to England with somebody, and they made a large purchase, but he was there for business.

20:44.267 --> 20:45.408
I didn't send him to buy books.

20:45.628 --> 20:50.854
I mean, you wouldn't send... I mean, you'd almost endeavour to get him what he was looking for.

20:51.194 --> 20:53.016
Absolutely.

20:54.078 --> 20:54.498
Absolutely.

20:55.159 --> 20:56.400
That's not a typical situation.

20:56.821 --> 21:04.309
Obviously, we're business people, and we try to sell people our own inventory, but we also recognise we're not the only shop.

21:04.559 --> 21:10.304
but we have enough confidence to believe that we encourage our customers to go elsewhere, to get a sense of what else there is.

21:10.605 --> 21:18.292
Then they generally come back because they recognize the trouble we want to accumulate this inventory, and they often make purchases because of it.

21:18.372 --> 21:26.580
One of the themes of my book, and if there is a theme that will tie all these diverse chapters together, is the passion.

21:27.120 --> 21:28.381
The passion.

21:28.862 --> 21:30.523
I'll be very empathetic at the word.

21:31.304 --> 21:33.486
That drives a person to spend

21:33.871 --> 21:41.403
whatever it is, to invest so much energy into the possession of books, motivation.

21:41.703 --> 21:44.067
I mean, that's not my title.

21:45.910 --> 21:53.983
But I guess what I'm asking is, do you, either of you, have a fix on what drives a person to want to possess these things?

21:54.985 --> 21:58.410
I'd be surprised if there was an answer for all people.

21:58.745 --> 22:00.588
There are definitely many different answers.

22:00.628 --> 22:02.230
And I'd like you both to address yourself.

22:02.250 --> 22:03.993
So Ben will try it first.

22:04.474 --> 22:20.077
Well, I think, first of all, there's an intrinsic value to a book, you know, the association of this is a first edition of something that was produced during the author's lifetime and possibly he held in his hand.

22:20.418 --> 22:22.140
So there's a closeness to the author.

22:22.521 --> 22:24.544
There's also a visual appeal.

22:24.884 --> 22:28.009
You know, there are a lot of books that are sold for visual reasons.

22:28.327 --> 22:37.982
And I think some people might say, oh, I have this big house and this big library, and therefore I want to fill my shelves with beautiful literature, because now I have everything else in my life I never want.

22:38.002 --> 22:40.346
That's kind of putting the card before the horse, though.

22:40.486 --> 22:45.473
And there is one major collector who I've interviewed who started collecting for precisely that reason.

22:45.494 --> 22:47.096
He wanted the library.

22:47.276 --> 22:51.282
He visualized it, and then started buying Shakespeare's at auction.

22:51.302 --> 22:56.190
I think there is a real surprise among collectors, especially new collectors, in what is available.

22:56.390 --> 22:59.034
People are almost always shocked who start out collecting.

22:59.054 --> 23:04.682
They say, you could buy a first edition of Treasure Island for, you know, $500 or $1,500.

23:04.723 --> 23:15.519
You could buy a first edition of Charles Gardner Verse or, you know, one of the classics of what they consider the 19th century classics for a relatively low price.

23:15.559 --> 23:24.372
You could buy first editions of Bioga, Mark Twain, for $25 to $300 because he was so popular late in his life that his books are enormously plentiful.

23:24.622 --> 23:36.255
And so people are really genuinely shocked, and they feel there's a quality here that they don't see perhaps in other areas, and they're really, I think, don't you think they're surprised about it?

23:36.295 --> 23:38.537
Don't you think that's a purely common response?

23:38.557 --> 23:42.822
Well, they're surprised that all these things aren't in museums and libraries.

23:42.902 --> 23:45.365
And it's naive, but I mean... It is that way.

23:45.425 --> 23:48.208
There's more to it than that.

23:48.288 --> 23:52.873
Because we can go to a museum and see these things and say how beautiful they are.

23:53.410 --> 24:17.578
I think that people that collect books also have maybe collected, there's a certain type of collector that only spends maybe three years of his life occupied with the thought of collecting books, and prior to that maybe he collected coins, and prior to that he might have collected antique furniture, and I'm talking about the people with large amounts of money to spend.

24:17.896 --> 24:22.484
And it's a diversion for them, and I think they kind of drift into it as another area.

24:22.885 --> 24:30.518
I don't think... You know, I think... They also love the response they get from people when people look at their libraries, because it's not like looking at art or something.

24:30.558 --> 24:33.843
It's sort of a little bit more mysterious, you know?

24:33.864 --> 24:41.136
Well, I find... What I found is that the real book person, generally, it's not like putting a picture on a wall.

24:41.588 --> 24:44.131
It's not something that you buy the show to somebody else.

24:44.331 --> 24:53.942
Well, maybe it's not, but I was just saying there's a real satisfaction in having it, from a lot of people I know, and the response that people who are non-collectors get.

24:54.003 --> 24:59.929
You know, it's funny, if you know a little bit about a field and the other person knows nothing, you're pure to know a great deal.

25:01.892 --> 25:08.980
You brought up something which, in the many interviews that I've conducted in this research,

25:09.500 --> 25:10.401
It's interesting.

25:10.481 --> 25:16.628
I haven't talked with anybody about somebody coming in and saying, I want to collect, but I don't know what.

25:17.008 --> 25:17.369
Help me.

25:17.809 --> 25:19.872
Oh, that's an extremely common question for us.

25:20.052 --> 25:20.532
You get that.

25:20.592 --> 25:22.234
Well, more so in this building.

25:22.274 --> 25:27.200
I'll tell you, this building has brought us to a different kind of climbing to a certain extent.

25:27.580 --> 25:38.933
People would be uncomfortable walking into a used bookshop and buying their book for $500, but they'd come in to us and they wouldn't feel uncomfortable because they'd almost expect it.

25:39.284 --> 25:46.822
And I think it has to do a lot with the ambiance that we've created in the building, near proximity to Rodeo Drive, may have something to do with it.

25:46.842 --> 25:47.122
Exactly.

25:47.162 --> 25:57.647
It is intimidating to have to ring a doorbell and have somebody come to the door to say, once you're in the door, you feel almost an obligation.

25:57.779 --> 26:00.161
Well, we're not a high question.

26:00.201 --> 26:00.842
No, we're not.

26:00.862 --> 26:01.703
We're certainly not.

26:01.843 --> 26:06.507
But I would say the percentage of sales are greater than any other store where people just walk in and out.

26:06.547 --> 26:09.109
We have very few people, and we might have 10 people a day.

26:09.129 --> 26:12.552
Of course, most of our business is mail order catalogs and phone calls, things like that.

26:12.792 --> 26:14.434
Is most of your business local?

26:16.336 --> 26:17.457
It's hard to say.

26:17.557 --> 26:19.298
Well, it's hard to say.

26:19.498 --> 26:20.079
I don't think so.

26:20.139 --> 26:20.940
I don't think so at all.

26:20.960 --> 26:22.561
Most of it's definitely not local.

26:22.581 --> 26:26.565
I would say most of it is phone calls from out-of-state, mail order.

26:26.705 --> 26:26.925
Really?

26:27.175 --> 26:33.701
Really, it's much more so, I think we could look at our books, but I bet you 50% of our sales were out of state last year.

26:33.881 --> 26:37.004
Right.

26:37.844 --> 26:38.645
Should we go home early?

26:38.665 --> 26:41.708
That's what I know, 5.30.

26:42.789 --> 26:43.590
You know what it is?

26:43.610 --> 26:49.014
It's that also many people come from out of town, and if they're coming to Los Angeles, they're going to come and see us.

26:49.034 --> 26:51.817
So if they walk into the door, it's still not local, it's still out of town.

26:51.837 --> 26:56.541
That's a great thing, because if you're at all interested in books, at least you've probably heard of us.

26:56.690 --> 26:58.152
We miss very few people.

26:58.213 --> 27:03.121
It's very unusual if somebody's been collecting for a few years, comes to the West Coast, and wouldn't stop him to see us.

27:03.602 --> 27:04.824
That's what makes it sense.

27:04.944 --> 27:09.031
Now, I wouldn't be a journalist of any stature if I didn't ask you the question.

27:10.914 --> 27:16.524
I asked if you thought that you were perhaps the most successful bookseller in the United States, and you said it was possible.

27:16.544 --> 27:18.146
Could you give me a rough idea of what your gross?

27:20.911 --> 27:22.073
Well, it's about $4 million.

27:22.913 --> 27:26.518
But that's why I say it's not a lot, considering, because it's such a small business.

27:26.658 --> 27:27.699
That's the gross?

27:27.719 --> 27:28.360
Yeah.

27:28.380 --> 27:29.542
I mean, it's not like, that's all.

27:29.562 --> 27:31.024
I mean, you thought it was like $20 million.

27:31.144 --> 27:32.045
I thought, well, I haven't told it.

27:32.065 --> 27:32.686
It was like $20 million.

27:32.706 --> 27:32.926
I know.

27:33.127 --> 27:33.727
Everybody tells you.

27:33.848 --> 27:34.649
It's not.

27:34.669 --> 27:36.491
You know how hard it is to spend $20 million?

27:36.511 --> 27:37.432
Another seller told me $20 million.

27:37.452 --> 27:37.933
They don't know.

27:38.614 --> 27:41.057
I mean, we, that's all gross.

27:41.718 --> 27:43.701
And that's why I'm saying it's such a small business.

27:44.061 --> 27:46.124
Maybe it'll cost $5 million this year.

27:46.244 --> 27:47.686
But it's certainly in that range.

27:47.726 --> 27:48.767
It's not $20 million.

27:49.008 --> 27:50.710
I mean, I don't know, but it's not, uh,

27:50.993 --> 27:53.276
It's not what people say it is.

27:54.217 --> 27:58.883
But I imagine you're flattered, at least, or are you annoyed when you hear those figures?

27:59.323 --> 28:04.690
Well, what annoys me or humors me more than anything is when people say it as if it was factual.

28:04.990 --> 28:06.632
I happen to know it's common knowledge.

28:06.813 --> 28:09.997
That's good information.

28:10.277 --> 28:15.804
But it's funny you should throw 20, because that's exactly the figure I've heard from a very prominent East color.

28:15.824 --> 28:16.765
I heard I did 40.

28:16.998 --> 28:25.768
You know, I'm sorry to hear all this because my brother has been fooling around with those books for a long time now and not sharing it with me.

28:25.868 --> 28:28.371
I've been looking very well, and I appreciate it.

28:29.612 --> 28:36.479
But I mean, we know that the English firms like Quaritch and Max gross 15 million dollars, 8 million pounds, 12 million pounds, something like that.

28:36.720 --> 28:38.562
Well, Quaritch is unbelievable.

28:38.602 --> 28:39.923
What did they do this year?

28:39.943 --> 28:40.164
No.

28:40.184 --> 28:41.065
Because it's published.

28:41.085 --> 28:42.106
Yeah, we saw it someplace.

28:42.126 --> 28:46.971
I think they also count all of their purchases that they purchased at auction, though, as part of that.

28:47.120 --> 28:48.121
Yeah, so that's the whole thing.

28:48.141 --> 28:49.623
We don't count our auction purchases.

28:49.683 --> 28:51.024
Of course, we're talking about straight sales.

28:51.625 --> 28:59.033
I understand that Quaritch, though, they made some kind of deal where they were awash in it.

28:59.193 --> 29:01.736
Oh, yeah, they sold the great collection of botanical books.

29:01.856 --> 29:02.457
Exactly.

29:03.358 --> 29:04.439
Five million pounds.

29:04.459 --> 29:07.462
They almost had to go out.

29:07.482 --> 29:10.565
And they dominated when they wanted to, for some of these reasons.

29:10.586 --> 29:12.988
Well, they always have, because it's such a small business.

29:13.008 --> 29:14.730
Somebody came in with $10 to $20 million.

29:14.930 --> 29:16.111
It's an enormous amount of money.

29:16.131 --> 29:19.195
You go into the art world, you buy a painting for 15 million hours, and you move on.

29:20.036 --> 29:24.521
In our business, it's a relatively, it's incomprehensible thing.

29:24.642 --> 29:26.344
You did say something interesting earlier.

29:26.424 --> 29:29.908
If you were doing something else, you'd be a very wealthy man.

29:29.988 --> 29:33.032
Oh, I said that believing it, that's why.

29:33.052 --> 29:34.834
Because I said we have... Like what?

29:34.854 --> 29:35.875
I mean, what do you think?

29:35.935 --> 29:44.245
I love what I do, and I wasn't suggesting I do something else, but I think I have a real frustration with being constant in that

29:44.461 --> 29:47.264
We've moved three times, and we've always changed and increased.

29:47.324 --> 29:54.452
Our staff tried to do relatively creative things, considering it's not a business that's changed dramatically in the last 500 years.

29:54.492 --> 29:59.037
You have a book, you buy it, you sell it, and maybe how you promote it is slightly different.

29:59.057 --> 29:59.938
Fact or myth?

29:59.958 --> 30:01.140
Another story I heard.

30:01.160 --> 30:05.124
See, you guys have built up your own mythology around you.

30:05.144 --> 30:10.350
You made a killing in the real estate business and went into the... That was the best news I ever heard.

30:10.583 --> 30:31.829
For 15 years before we ever bought a building, and it's true that, you know, property is a good place to put money, but, I mean, we bought our own building here, and it's doubled in value in five years, and we've made more money on paper, whatever that's worth, but you have to sell a building.

30:31.969 --> 30:37.536
This building is worth probably over $4 million today or something, but we didn't buy it for that purpose.

30:37.702 --> 30:43.131
And at some point, what would happen if their building was ever worth seven or eight million dollars or something, we'd say, hey, you know, it's crazy.

30:43.151 --> 30:47.739
We could make more money by not working just on the building, by just renting or selling the building.

30:47.779 --> 30:48.440
It's a sad reality.

30:49.261 --> 30:49.962
Then what would you do?

30:51.605 --> 30:53.989
We'd become collectors then.

30:54.630 --> 30:57.475
Ben, Lou told me that he's a collector of sorts.

30:57.615 --> 31:00.520
Do you just collect anything at all?

31:00.989 --> 31:02.031
Any collecting interests?

31:02.191 --> 31:04.135
I do, but it's periodic.

31:04.215 --> 31:08.944
I've collected Stephen King, and I got tired of him, but I still have a small Stephen King collection.

31:09.285 --> 31:18.002
But prior to that, I collected books on con men, books on forgeries, books on... Literary?

31:18.142 --> 31:23.352
Literary, and any type of forgery, not necessarily literary.

31:23.652 --> 31:26.056
Just mostly schemes and cons.

31:26.637 --> 31:28.059
But we don't want that in the book.

31:28.280 --> 31:28.821
No.

31:29.802 --> 31:35.913
It's always had an interest in mine, but never used the knowledge for any great degree.

31:37.095 --> 31:39.919
You did mention that there was a piece in the Times, the Sunday Times.

31:39.939 --> 31:40.981
Oh, that was just a quote.

31:41.021 --> 31:41.983
Yeah, but it is interesting.

31:42.524 --> 31:48.654
There is a perception of a tripartite alliance between Cummins and yourself.

31:48.754 --> 31:49.135
And Joseph.

31:49.275 --> 31:49.896
And Joseph.

31:50.213 --> 31:54.432
And if it's true, you do have London and New York and L.A.

31:54.452 --> 31:54.854
tied up.

31:54.874 --> 31:59.937
Well, we have been working together for the last five years very actively in that

32:00.170 --> 32:04.256
many important books and collections we view by or each other.

32:04.536 --> 32:10.065
In other words, if I hear of something in London, I have Dave, go look at her on the New York gym, go look at her, I'll look at something on the West Coast.

32:10.245 --> 32:19.599
And we cooperate very well, and there's a possibility someday in the future we may, in fact, do something to... Well, it might be the future of bookseller.

32:20.120 --> 32:27.831
It's not the first time, because Warren Howell and Jake Zeitlin worked together all the time, although they were both in California, they were both coasts.

32:28.132 --> 32:34.020
And I'm sure that Zeitlin also worked with Krauss and other dealers where they worked closely.

32:34.601 --> 32:42.632
Is this mainly in terms of acquisitions or sales or trying to develop collections that you might sell?

32:42.853 --> 32:43.814
Actually, all of them.

32:43.834 --> 32:48.300
We've really, through a friendship, which makes it a lot easier, we just put it open.

32:49.482 --> 32:51.084
Is this gentleman opening the safe of those?

32:51.184 --> 32:52.867
Those are the internables, is that right?

32:52.887 --> 32:56.051
Well, it's a two-book minimum.

32:56.071 --> 32:57.413
Is that where you keep the internables?

32:57.595 --> 33:01.981
Well, not necessarily 15th century books, because sometimes they're just 19th or 20th century books.

33:02.041 --> 33:07.628
Well, actually earlier books, but they're certainly books that are more valuable or easier to disappear.

33:07.668 --> 33:08.950
Of course, they're small, little ones.

33:08.990 --> 33:10.992
They're Book of Hours or something like that.

33:11.593 --> 33:13.535
So we don't want to lose them.

33:14.076 --> 33:18.282
You know, ever since Ben and I have been in business, it's always been rumors.

33:18.642 --> 33:20.825
People used to tell us, who's telling us?

33:20.845 --> 33:21.265
Pet Boys.

33:21.305 --> 33:22.647
We read the letters of the temple.

33:22.707 --> 33:23.128
Pet Boys.

33:23.148 --> 33:25.030
What do you call that?

33:25.090 --> 33:25.611
I didn't spell it.

33:25.912 --> 33:30.076
They might not have the PEP boys back in California.

33:30.096 --> 33:32.098
It's an auto supply house.

33:32.658 --> 33:37.602
My type is going to have a PEP.

33:37.642 --> 33:41.246
We heard that rumor about 10 years ago.

33:41.306 --> 33:42.867
It's funny why people won't accept the truth.

33:42.887 --> 33:45.810
The truth is that we really work very hard on it.

33:47.591 --> 33:53.877
This has always been our principal source of income, even though we've diversified and done other things.

33:54.160 --> 33:57.003
that have been, unfortunately, successful.

33:57.023 --> 34:01.588
We haven't used the outside money to put back on the business, because we've never taken outside money from anything.

34:01.608 --> 34:04.051
We've taken the money out of this business and put it outside.

34:04.171 --> 34:05.533
How have you diversified this service to me?

34:05.553 --> 34:07.795
I mean, we have an interest in a hotel in New York City.

34:07.815 --> 34:14.383
We own, in midtown Manhattan, we have a, I don't know, 40, what's collectively, 40 percent interest in it, about.

34:15.284 --> 34:15.824
Which hotel is there?

34:15.844 --> 34:17.206
It's called the Consulate Hotel.

34:17.286 --> 34:18.047
It's on 49th Street.

34:18.067 --> 34:19.488
It's a 210-room hotel.

34:20.590 --> 34:20.910
Nice.

34:21.413 --> 34:22.914
Yeah, it's a free place to stay for us.

34:23.455 --> 34:25.717
That's why we originally, when we invested in it, it wasn't.

34:26.258 --> 34:26.898
Well, it's true.

34:26.998 --> 34:28.180
Do you stay when you're out of there?

34:28.260 --> 34:28.600
I do.

34:28.640 --> 34:32.704
My wife doesn't approve, because it's a, you know, like $75 a night.

34:32.724 --> 34:34.285
It's very... How do we spell it?

34:34.806 --> 34:37.669
Constated, C-O-N-S-U-L-A-T-E.

34:37.689 --> 34:37.929
Okay.

34:37.949 --> 34:39.130
49th Street.

34:40.231 --> 34:49.260
And, but that was a relatively modest investment, because when we took that over and got involved in it, it was not

34:49.510 --> 34:51.472
very profit was losing money.

34:51.572 --> 34:51.992
Where was it on?

34:52.012 --> 34:52.913
Did you say 49th?

34:52.933 --> 34:54.295
49th between 7th and 8th.

34:54.315 --> 34:55.576
Especially on the west side a little bit.

34:55.596 --> 34:59.880
That's where they're rebuilding that entire area.

35:00.180 --> 35:03.564
Actually, that turned out to be probably our best investment of all outside.

35:03.584 --> 35:07.688
Not that we have so many, but that was certainly... Except for the book business investment.

35:08.929 --> 35:10.831
Wait, is that where there's two brothers?

35:10.851 --> 35:11.411
Are you kidding?

35:12.352 --> 35:15.295
You might tell them about all the relatives we have in the business.

35:15.315 --> 35:17.057
You know how many brothers we have in the book business?

35:17.077 --> 35:17.357
Ten relatives.

35:17.860 --> 35:23.747
See, I have a brother, Bob, between us and age, who has the Book Baron, a shop that has probably 300,000 books.

35:23.827 --> 35:25.088
Where is that?

35:26.750 --> 35:29.874
Bob is in Hawaiian Gardens, which is in California.

35:29.894 --> 35:30.975
That's the name of the community?

35:31.035 --> 35:31.476
Hawaiian?

35:31.516 --> 35:33.358
Hawaiian Gardens, I think.

35:33.658 --> 35:38.564
My brother, my sister Frances, has Book City, which has two shops, used book shops.

35:38.584 --> 35:41.448
These are all used books in L.A., in Los Angeles, and Hollywood.

35:41.468 --> 35:43.190
It's the one remaining shop I told you about.

35:43.890 --> 35:44.391
It's a vibe.

35:44.573 --> 35:48.660
My nephew, Danny, has a shop in the Valley.

35:48.680 --> 35:51.826
My niece has a used bookshop in San Francisco.

35:52.106 --> 35:53.449
What's the name of that store?

35:53.469 --> 35:54.591
What's the name of Donna's store?

35:54.671 --> 35:56.053
I don't know what the name is.

35:56.073 --> 35:56.775
I've never been there.

35:56.915 --> 35:58.037
It's a different bookshop.

36:00.000 --> 36:07.113
Sam has a used bookshop called I Love Books.

36:07.153 --> 36:08.235
What is that?

36:08.355 --> 36:09.417
About Sacramento area.

36:09.734 --> 36:13.680
How does this happen?

36:14.341 --> 36:15.522
We could do well with this.

36:15.562 --> 36:17.685
This has to be the easiest business in the world.

36:19.508 --> 36:20.930
But do you do things with each other?

36:21.611 --> 36:22.613
Well, we do.

36:22.853 --> 36:25.537
We operate independently, really.

36:25.557 --> 36:27.400
We're the only ones who really deal with more valuable books.

36:27.420 --> 36:30.164
We get reasonable referrals from it.

36:30.584 --> 36:38.796
And sometimes we offer more modest books, used books, that we tend to turn over to one of the other family members.

36:39.130 --> 36:42.753
Although, strangely enough, we do relatively much less than people would think.

36:44.094 --> 36:47.277
I mean, we're not at all competitive.

36:47.357 --> 36:51.220
Well, did these other family members come to you, too, and say, hey, we'd like to get started.

36:51.260 --> 36:51.761
What do we do?

36:52.261 --> 36:56.024
Actually, they're all six brothers and two sisters.

36:56.505 --> 37:01.069
And actually, everybody except Leah is in the book business now, isn't it?

37:01.089 --> 37:02.330
Leah and Bobby.

37:03.010 --> 37:05.513
I have a brother and a sister who are not.

37:05.533 --> 37:07.334
And then I have a child on them, though.

37:07.414 --> 37:08.395
And a step-sister.

37:08.510 --> 37:18.440
But they're all in the used book business, and they're all pretty good business people, and I don't want to say except.

37:18.961 --> 37:21.103
I want to say they're all reasonably good business people.

37:21.523 --> 37:30.472
They do pretty good considering what they do, and they do books from $5 to $50 range, but they sell surprisingly large quantities.

37:30.693 --> 37:32.955
If you have a chance, you ought to go to Book City in Hollywood.

37:33.055 --> 37:35.117
It's like Strand in New York.

37:35.137 --> 37:35.918
Really?

37:36.573 --> 37:37.895
Book City and Hollywood.

37:37.915 --> 37:38.316
Book City.

37:38.336 --> 37:41.060
It's probably the biggest used bookshop in the West of the United States.

37:41.701 --> 37:44.665
After Strand, it's probably the biggest used bookshop in the country, I would think.

37:45.026 --> 37:46.328
The Strand is on a little more.

37:46.348 --> 37:48.011
Yeah, well, The Strand is on a little more.

37:48.031 --> 37:49.092
Yeah, well, The Strand is on a little more.

37:49.112 --> 37:49.974
Yeah, well, The Strand is on a little more.

37:49.994 --> 37:51.015
Yeah, well, The Strand is on a little more.

37:51.035 --> 37:51.937
Yeah, well, The Strand is on a little more.

37:51.957 --> 37:53.159
Yeah, well, The Strand is on a little more.

37:53.179 --> 37:54.300
Yeah, well, The Strand is on a little more.

37:54.320 --> 37:55.723
Yeah, well, The Strand is on a little more.

37:55.743 --> 37:56.864
Yeah, well, The Strand is on a little more.

37:56.884 --> 37:57.986
Yeah, well, The Strand is on a little more.

37:58.006 --> 37:59.328
Yeah, well, The Strand is on a little more.

37:59.348 --> 38:00.390
Yeah, well, The Strand is on a little more.

38:00.410 --> 38:01.331
Yeah, well, The Strand is on a little more.

38:01.351 --> 38:02.233
Yeah, well, The Strand is on a little more.

38:02.253 --> 38:02.513
Yeah, I don't

38:02.780 --> 38:04.963
And so one every two years, and that would be a lot.

38:04.983 --> 38:06.665
I was hoping to sell them by the page.

38:07.706 --> 38:08.467
How do you post books?

38:10.089 --> 38:10.489
Very well.

38:10.930 --> 38:13.653
I mean, I don't mean in terms of, how do you go above?

38:13.673 --> 38:15.435
I mean, are the prices higher here?

38:15.455 --> 38:17.858
I mean, you have a higher overhead.

38:17.878 --> 38:21.582
I'd say there are some books that are geographically scarce.

38:21.662 --> 38:30.212
That is, there are common books, the 19th century English books, that may be common in England but uncommon here, that I go over and bring back, and they're probably 20% or 30% higher.

38:30.272 --> 38:32.635
I'm talking about $50 to $500 books.

38:33.188 --> 38:59.685
uh i buy them there and bring them back but uh otherwise i mean most of our pricing is is actually done through experience it's very rare we ever look up at the value of a book i mean it's one out of every couple hundred books we'll check with the last copy for it and try to do we almost always price it according to memory as to what our last copy is you know i can't remember and the demand you asked though we've had a lot of requests for it well we don't you know some of the most of the books i ever buy i

39:00.290 --> 39:07.580
Of course, we stick with fairly traditional things, but I don't know that we go by request.

39:07.640 --> 39:09.442
I have a brother, Jerry, who takes care of search service.

39:09.783 --> 39:10.904
That's the request division.

39:11.204 --> 39:12.766
We sort of take care of it.

39:12.787 --> 39:13.027
In here?

39:13.047 --> 39:13.507
Yeah.

39:13.527 --> 39:15.310
He takes care of book search service.

39:15.670 --> 39:17.413
You said a brother, Jerry, working in here?

39:17.453 --> 39:18.294
He's the man out of the shop.

39:18.334 --> 39:19.616
He's actually off this afternoon.

39:19.676 --> 39:21.738
He had an appointment.

39:21.979 --> 39:24.542
And the binder is my nephew, I think I told you that.

39:25.045 --> 39:28.589
Ben's son works here, and my son works here part-time.

39:28.829 --> 39:31.913
It's more or less sounds like a family business.

39:31.993 --> 39:33.014
Well, no more or less.

39:33.034 --> 39:38.841
We even have an ex-wife from a brother that was 25 years ago that works here.

39:38.861 --> 39:39.402
That's funny.

39:39.642 --> 39:42.065
He left his wife, but we kept her because she's pretty good.

39:42.085 --> 39:49.213
Do you ever buy something, and Dave Kirshenbaum would do this with Bradley White and say, Bradley, I've got something you've got to have.

39:49.293 --> 39:50.715
I mean, does that ever happen?

39:51.792 --> 39:52.893
What do we say to a customer?

39:52.913 --> 39:56.196
Well, you see something and you say, I know the customer who could go crazy over this.

39:57.096 --> 39:58.358
Rosenbach used to do that.

39:59.018 --> 40:00.299
Sometimes a ploy, though.

40:00.579 --> 40:01.300
Of course.

40:01.340 --> 40:05.163
I don't know if that happens, but I wouldn't even call it a ploy.

40:05.404 --> 40:10.688
Well, I think I'd love for somebody to call me and say, I don't know if you've got the Brindley catalog, which I don't.

40:10.708 --> 40:12.550
You want it?

40:13.310 --> 40:13.731
Yeah.

40:14.171 --> 40:14.831
How much?

40:14.851 --> 40:17.894
What are we talking?

40:17.934 --> 40:18.835
Do we say that?

40:18.995 --> 40:20.336
I don't say that as a matter of course.

40:20.376 --> 40:21.377
I might have said that.

40:21.728 --> 40:26.573
But I hopefully never say the same things twice, because I would never have much success.

40:27.014 --> 40:29.016
I try to come up with something that I believe in.

40:29.036 --> 40:32.159
But I mean, you might run across something that's particularly exciting.

40:32.599 --> 40:33.720
Do you get excited by books?

40:35.442 --> 40:40.888
I'll tell you, I think books are sometimes, like drugs, you need a bigger and bigger fix all the time.

40:41.068 --> 40:43.871
The books that used to excite me, now I need a little bigger high.

40:43.931 --> 40:45.533
I need something more important.

40:45.573 --> 40:46.674
Give me some examples.

40:46.834 --> 40:51.499
It takes something extraordinarily unusual to get excited about.

40:51.985 --> 40:54.889
We get excited about opportunities a lot, I think.

40:54.909 --> 40:56.752
Opportunities to buy important collections.

40:57.252 --> 41:00.998
Much more excited about buying exciting collections and selling.

41:01.078 --> 41:03.481
Also great copies, I think, get excited.

41:03.621 --> 41:09.890
Every so often we see a copy of an important book that we've never seen a copy quite like it, and we say, this is unbelievable.

41:09.910 --> 41:10.811
Look at this copy.

41:11.192 --> 41:11.953
And that would excite us.

41:11.993 --> 41:14.276
Not necessarily the book, but the copy of the book.

41:14.997 --> 41:17.601
And so I think we think of it in those terms.

41:17.841 --> 41:21.486
And I just want to make a comment on the buying, and that is we buy

41:21.803 --> 41:25.328
not necessarily by title, but by interest.

41:25.348 --> 41:26.890
In other words, a subject interest.

41:27.171 --> 41:31.336
We don't know the book at all, but we know that there is a demand for this type of book.

41:31.677 --> 41:34.501
And so we'll buy on that basis rather than individual title.

41:34.561 --> 41:41.431
Luke, tell me, because I didn't have a machine, tell me about that first American printings edition collection.

41:42.973 --> 41:47.459
I'm actually forming that collection jointly with James Cummings, bookseller.

41:47.940 --> 41:51.625
And it was our feeling about seven years ago that a lot of great books

41:51.841 --> 42:18.979
are getting so that they're no longer affordable so we decided to buy them as they first appeared in this country mostly 18th century america printed a lot of the classics for the first time and uh we have a cutoff date of 1800 actually as we won original editions of the great books that is the original edition had to appear before the 1800s uh and we uh

42:19.685 --> 42:23.792
put together about 300 biomes, and we're going to try to get about 350 biomes.

42:23.812 --> 42:25.135
We want to get up to about 1,000 biomes.

42:25.555 --> 42:26.717
We have no interest in selling it.

42:26.737 --> 42:31.245
Of course, we're going to do a catalog of hopefully someday.

42:31.265 --> 42:35.954
It's sort of, it's really a fun project more than anyone else.

42:36.234 --> 42:40.842
We'll eventually sell it, but I think we're more honest about it, that we will sell it.

42:40.862 --> 42:42.385
I mean, we're collecting, we're having a good time.

42:42.517 --> 42:45.662
If somebody wanted to buy it now, they'd have to pay more than it's worth.

42:45.922 --> 42:47.685
Now, you and Jim are doing this jointly.

42:48.486 --> 42:50.429
Did you get a chance to talk to Jim?

42:50.449 --> 42:55.676
I know Jim, and we've chatted, and I only go to New York to see him.

42:55.697 --> 43:04.690
But I'm really doing the least accessible interviews first, and kind of coming back, although I've done a number of interviews in New York and Boston.

43:04.710 --> 43:06.853
But Jim and I have talked, and we're really talking.

43:07.002 --> 43:07.342
Right.

43:07.362 --> 43:08.844
But Jim will tell you about it.

43:08.884 --> 43:11.187
We just started with one book.

43:11.207 --> 43:13.090
We just said, well, we'll never sell this book.

43:13.110 --> 43:14.071
Let's just put it away.

43:14.251 --> 43:15.873
And we found enough books we wouldn't sell.

43:15.893 --> 43:17.896
We said, you know, I have about six first American editions.

43:17.916 --> 43:18.717
I can't sell them.

43:18.737 --> 43:19.378
He couldn't sell them.

43:19.398 --> 43:20.900
They were relatively cheap, $50 to $500.

43:20.980 --> 43:24.584
I mean, relative compared to how much the first appearance would be.

43:24.644 --> 43:26.086
But as a collection, it might be pretty nice.

43:26.106 --> 43:30.732
We think you have 800 books on the coffee table.

43:31.100 --> 43:34.825
If you have one, you might have a hard time selling it.

43:34.945 --> 43:36.747
Well, where is the collection?

43:37.829 --> 43:38.630
Most of it is up there.

43:38.670 --> 43:40.312
Some of it is the bindery having cases.

43:40.372 --> 43:41.674
Does Jim have any in New York?

43:41.954 --> 43:44.378
No, they're really relatively small physically.

43:44.418 --> 43:48.283
A lot of the 18th century American books were small.

43:48.363 --> 43:56.854
Is this the first concerted collection that you put together?

43:58.117 --> 44:02.001
I probably put together other collections, but much more modestly.

44:02.481 --> 44:08.448
Oh, I think we put together collections of bibliography in the beginning, and booksellers, memoirs, and things like that, through the years.

44:08.508 --> 44:15.054
Yeah, we consider that collection of reference books all collecting, in a sense, because we do have seven and a half thousand volumes up there now.

44:15.535 --> 44:19.659
We've never been people to take out of stock our best books and hide them.

44:19.679 --> 44:20.900
We've always had them out there.

44:20.920 --> 44:23.483
Yeah, well, I think the perception of what I said,

44:24.053 --> 44:26.235
Very few dealers have been able to get away with this.

44:26.275 --> 44:27.256
Rosenbach is one.

44:27.276 --> 44:31.761
I mean, he would say, well, if you don't buy it, I'm going to keep it for myself.

44:33.002 --> 44:33.563
And it worked.

44:33.963 --> 44:36.466
Well, if you have enough money in the bank, we're practical about it.

44:36.506 --> 44:39.188
We feel that everything is for sale.

44:39.328 --> 44:40.249
We're business people.

44:40.490 --> 44:41.671
Well, we've done that ourselves.

44:41.771 --> 44:45.955
All these books you see here are the ones that when customers didn't buy them, we said, well, we'll keep them ourselves.

44:45.975 --> 44:46.996
This is the stock.

44:47.036 --> 44:49.939
By the way, how large would you say the stock is?

44:50.740 --> 44:52.862
You know, I was told you it was close to $10,000.

44:53.939 --> 44:55.561
I would have had much more.

44:55.622 --> 44:56.162
No, that's all.

44:56.443 --> 44:57.825
Because it's spread out, you see.

44:58.165 --> 44:59.708
You mean in all the rooms or just down there?

44:59.748 --> 45:01.911
Well, 10,000 volumes for sale and 7,500.

45:02.071 --> 45:04.655
There are about 20,000 volumes in total, maybe.

45:04.675 --> 45:05.036
That's all.

45:05.396 --> 45:11.225
And it is important to point out, I'm doing a piece, by the way, for a very interesting publication.

45:11.245 --> 45:16.533
This is a book I'm writing for a very interesting publication.

45:16.573 --> 45:23.203
And one of the questions they have asked me to see if I can answer is, has book selling changed

45:24.010 --> 45:29.738
dramatically today from what it was, say, during Rosenbach's time that you had Dr. Rosenbach.

45:29.758 --> 45:30.459
I wish I was there.

45:30.659 --> 45:32.562
And Hans Kroos, you know, and George.

45:32.582 --> 45:36.747
Oh, I think those people are much brighter than the books I was today, much more scholarly.

45:36.767 --> 45:43.977
I mean, there are exceptions, but for the most part... Well, I think also they dealt in... You are one of the few full-service books.

45:44.412 --> 45:58.976
Well, it's amazing, but it's understandable, because people buy what they could relate to.

45:59.037 --> 46:00.800
And, you know, an edition of St.

46:00.920 --> 46:03.484
Augustine from the 15th century doesn't mean anything.

46:03.667 --> 46:07.471
a first edition of Hemingway's first book, Three Stories and Ten Films.

46:07.931 --> 46:08.692
It's worth $10,000.

46:08.972 --> 46:11.434
Well, it did better than that at the Bradley Martin sale.

46:11.474 --> 46:12.375
Well, it depends on the copy.

46:12.395 --> 46:13.036
I'm just saying it.

46:13.076 --> 46:19.161
The contrast is such that, and even most people who heard of Hemingway never heard of Three Stories and Ten Films, right?

46:19.181 --> 46:24.486
Well, when you went to a sale like the Bradley Martin sale, did you go, and you were busy.

46:25.107 --> 46:28.510
I was busy, but I wasn't as busy as I thought I'd be.

46:28.530 --> 46:30.552
I mean, I hoped to buy more.

46:30.852 --> 46:37.622
I have very mixed theories about sales, because when the price is extremely low, it's a little scary, and when they're extremely high, it's a little difficult.

46:37.642 --> 46:39.505
I like it just so I could buy some material.

46:39.665 --> 46:46.394
I mean, if I bought more than 25% of what I bid on, I'd be really... Were you there buying basically for stock or for corn?

46:46.415 --> 46:48.718
Yeah, I think we bought almost exclusively for stock in Bradley.

46:48.858 --> 46:53.425
Well, there were no... I went to about four of them, I think.

46:53.505 --> 46:54.326
Yeah, we split it up.

46:54.586 --> 46:57.130
Most of the ones that I went to were the Natural History sales.

46:57.413 --> 47:03.365
And natural history is not necessarily a field that we specialize in, but there was some wonderful colored late natural history books.

47:04.047 --> 47:10.680
And Lou and I really are probably first businessmen, and then secondly booksellers.

47:10.880 --> 47:13.383
And if you say that open enough, he's going to have to write a book.

47:13.403 --> 47:17.809
Yeah, I agree with you, though.

47:17.849 --> 47:20.913
Believe me, I've already turned it down.

47:21.134 --> 47:26.321
One of the reasons we've diversified as much as we have is because we never wanted to miss an opportunity.

47:26.341 --> 47:27.462
Outside of the book business?

47:27.562 --> 47:32.830
No, within the book business, you know, people don't deal in incunables and fine printing.

47:32.850 --> 47:34.712
It's just not the thing you find in the book business.

47:34.732 --> 47:35.453
It's very unusual.

47:35.433 --> 47:38.438
I mean, that's a bigger difference in modern literature.

47:38.918 --> 47:47.992
And so we've found that if we have an opportunity to make some money in something rather than say no, we'll invest and make money rather than pass it on to somebody else.

47:48.012 --> 47:53.621
That's the one thing we feel makes the shop somewhat unusual in that we refuse to specialize.

47:53.701 --> 47:55.344
People say, what do you specialize in?

47:55.444 --> 47:58.729
We pursue opportunities as they're available.

47:58.749 --> 48:03.516
And our specialty does change as the interest in certain types of material change.

48:03.800 --> 48:10.606
Like, we might all of a sudden find that we're going much heavier into one area more than another, only because the demand is there.

48:10.627 --> 48:14.831
You know, the tracks are there, and we see the tracks, and we move the train along where the tracks go.

48:15.291 --> 48:16.933
And that seems to be the way we've been going.

48:17.753 --> 48:24.940
You know, if you read the Rosenbach book, you probably remember the one quote when he was at a sale, and he was bidding on a book in 2022, and he dropped out.

48:25.341 --> 48:28.083
And then the book went for, like, $15,000, $17,000.

48:28.263 --> 48:30.766
They were just about to sell it, and Rosenbach raised his hand.

48:30.806 --> 48:33.148
And after the sale, they came up to him and said, Mr. Rosenbach,

48:33.517 --> 48:34.398
Why did you buy the book?

48:34.418 --> 48:35.479
You dropped that at $2200."

48:35.499 --> 48:38.523
And he says, I didn't know there was so much interest in the book.

48:38.543 --> 48:40.925
That's a wonderful story.

48:41.005 --> 48:42.227
It was in one of his books.

48:43.548 --> 48:45.470
Well, that's a good example of how we feel.

48:45.490 --> 48:48.253
You know, hey, if something's real expensive, we're going to pursue it.

48:48.874 --> 49:00.807
Ed Roth, who I interviewed, who wrote that book, he said, which was extraordinary, that he thought that he worked for what was a biography, not only his biography, and then he was a library publisher.

49:01.563 --> 49:09.438
But he thought that Krauss was a better book man, with respect to that he knew more about books.

49:09.678 --> 49:10.520
He was a scholar.

49:10.600 --> 49:18.535
And you mentioned that one of the differences, perhaps, between books selling today and in the olden days, is that they were more scholarly.

49:18.555 --> 49:19.337
They knew their books.

49:19.878 --> 49:21.681
I mean, have you fellas...

49:22.201 --> 49:23.162
I think that's true.

49:23.543 --> 49:25.806
Well, of course, we have more reference.

49:25.866 --> 49:28.149
I think the reference material we have available is much better.

49:28.389 --> 49:37.461
I mean, auction records, and there are more frequent sales, and there's better communication through Vax and telephone that we could be more aware of current prices.

49:38.402 --> 49:44.850
But what kind of an apprenticeship, say, does a person have to do to become a competent bookseller?

49:46.484 --> 49:53.355
We have so many people that have worked for us.

49:53.375 --> 49:56.580
We've probably had a hundred people work for us over the years that have come in.

49:56.600 --> 49:58.223
A lot of them have started their own shops.

49:58.383 --> 50:04.593
I've actually counted one day over 20 people that have their own shops that used to work there, you know, because they worked there a few years.

50:04.613 --> 50:06.416
You know, Glenn Horowitz started at this grant.

50:06.736 --> 50:06.936
Sure.

50:06.956 --> 50:08.419
I mean, everybody starts someplace else.

50:08.459 --> 50:09.520
We're the only ones who started.

50:10.322 --> 50:12.585
You know, I swear this is a true story.

50:12.605 --> 50:13.707
When we started out, we moved

50:13.822 --> 50:19.130
When we opened the bookshop in Compton, and we moved to Hollywood Boulevard after a year, we had no idea what we were doing.

50:19.851 --> 50:22.655
And the first day, we were building shelves, and I said, Ben, I'm going to go take a walk.

50:22.975 --> 50:26.020
I walked down the street, and I came back, and I said, Ben, you're not going to believe it.

50:26.040 --> 50:29.044
There's another guy doing the same thing we're doing, selling used books.

50:29.345 --> 50:31.187
I mean, I thought we invented selling used books.

50:31.207 --> 50:31.808
Can you believe it?

50:31.888 --> 50:33.010
The same thing we're doing?

50:33.230 --> 50:34.252
At what point?

50:34.472 --> 50:37.897
William Zaffer wrote a wonderful essay at times.

50:37.917 --> 50:43.305
You know, they used to be used books, but at some point, you crossed the line from used

50:43.724 --> 50:53.020
which have been previously owned, and become antiquarian, become rare, and a different kind of pattern is attached to the book.

50:53.040 --> 50:56.666
It's like, you know, there's a fine line between junk and antiques.

50:56.686 --> 51:03.538
I think the first time that we were able to sell a book for more money than was on the price tag of the book,

51:03.721 --> 51:06.185
We found we were in the real book business.

51:06.525 --> 51:14.657
I was saying the first time we found a book that was said $2.50, you know, when we first started selling books, most books were $1.50, $2.50 when they were sold new.

51:15.358 --> 51:23.310
And when we first used to sold a book that was priced for $1.50 for $2.50, we knew we were in a very special business, that we were getting more than the publisher was.

51:23.790 --> 51:28.918
And I think that was the first time we realized we were no longer selling used books.

51:29.033 --> 51:31.757
that they actually proved in value.

51:31.777 --> 51:31.957
Right.

51:31.998 --> 51:33.680
That there was a value to the text.

51:34.401 --> 51:47.341
The first reference book we ever had that told us prices, because we really had no knowledge what's about the prices, was a book put out by a guy in San Francisco by the name of Roski, and it was called The Bookman's Bible.

51:48.122 --> 51:55.834
And Roski had it coded so that you can code year, the author's last name and first name and the title of the book,

51:56.067 --> 51:58.449
And an odd number would give you auction records.

51:58.469 --> 52:01.412
An even number would be a dealer's price.

52:01.512 --> 52:06.898
And whatever Roski said, if Roski said $3, we'd say, well, these are professionals that charge $3.

52:06.938 --> 52:08.339
We'd price it $1.50.

52:08.720 --> 52:11.523
And we didn't realize at the time that $3 was auctioned.

52:11.543 --> 52:13.465
It could have been auctioned from 20 years ago.

52:13.765 --> 52:16.968
And sometimes we'd get a big, beautiful, elaborate book, and it'll save $5.

52:17.028 --> 52:20.592
I don't think Roski ever said more than like $120 on anything.

52:20.872 --> 52:24.876
But we were really impressed with him, because every book we ever looked for seemed to be in there.

52:24.974 --> 52:29.764
And then one day we went up to San Francisco, we said, let's go and visit Roski, because he was a bookseller up there.

52:30.105 --> 52:34.394
And we realized that he was selling books that were real junk, like Salvation Army books.

52:34.474 --> 52:38.122
And we still have Roski somewhere just for a souvenir.

52:38.443 --> 52:41.008
But that was our real first reference book.

52:42.153 --> 52:44.876
Lou says he went straight from high school into book selling.

52:44.916 --> 52:45.597
How about yourself?

52:45.657 --> 52:46.458
What's your background?

52:46.478 --> 52:47.940
Well, I went from high school.

52:47.960 --> 52:50.243
I worked a couple of years, went into the service.

52:50.403 --> 52:55.790
I served as librarian in the service, and then came out and started book selling then.

52:57.892 --> 52:58.213
Really?

52:58.253 --> 53:03.019
Well, I worked in the, I had, it was a small base up in northern Ontario.

53:03.039 --> 53:04.801
There were 200 people on the base.

53:04.821 --> 53:09.747
I volunteered for the library because I enjoyed reading, and it was an opportunity to order the books I wanted to read.

53:09.963 --> 53:11.625
So I said, oh, yeah, if I can order the books.

53:11.665 --> 53:14.008
They said, oh, yes, what the job responsibilities are.

53:14.028 --> 53:14.910
Northern Ontario in Canada?

53:14.930 --> 53:18.635
Northern Ontario in Canada was an early warning site for staff.

53:18.735 --> 53:19.416
Air Force?

53:19.436 --> 53:20.737
Yeah, that's right, for the Air Force.

53:21.258 --> 53:22.900
And so it gave me an opportunity.

53:22.920 --> 53:24.082
There's nothing else to do up there.

53:24.102 --> 53:29.469
It was 500 miles from, like, the closest small town, which was called Sioux Lookout.

53:29.890 --> 53:32.694
And so this was a wonderful opportunity to get everything I wanted to read.

53:34.836 --> 53:35.958
Was it nurtured at home?

53:35.978 --> 53:36.459
Your love for reading?

53:36.479 --> 53:37.540
It sounds like it was something that you...

53:37.688 --> 53:39.471
No, I think it was out of boredom.

53:41.273 --> 53:46.081
No, I mean, it is interesting that so many members of this one family is in the book business.

53:46.101 --> 53:47.824
I'm just wondering, you know, what this comes from.

53:47.844 --> 53:51.649
I think a lot of it had to do with profitability, to be very frank with you.

53:52.070 --> 53:59.141
I didn't enter the book business because I, well, Lou didn't either, because we thought that this is something, a love of books.

53:59.662 --> 54:03.848
I think it had to do with, we thought it was an opportunity with a very little bit of money

54:04.216 --> 54:08.661
to be able to do something productive, to do something successful.

54:09.001 --> 54:16.369
My father had been in the porn shop business, and this was kind of a little bit like the same thing of used type merchandise.

54:16.409 --> 54:18.792
So we were thinking in terms of used type merchandise.

54:19.433 --> 54:20.934
How old are you then?

54:21.074 --> 54:22.015
I'm 52.

54:23.457 --> 54:30.865
So you're part of this emerging, this generation, which I've seen, you know, kind of replace

54:31.418 --> 54:47.877
I've seen you guys at the auction houses, and it really is, as I mentioned to your brother, you see one generation that says, not even in their 60s, I mean 70s and 80s, and then you see a crowd, like in the mid-40s, early 50s, that's kind of taken over in their own way.

54:47.937 --> 54:49.739
Did you have a question come up?

54:50.139 --> 54:58.489
Well, when we first joined, you know, we remember the ABAA, of course, and when Lou and I first joined the Southern California Chapter, which was probably about

54:58.790 --> 55:06.180
22 or so years ago, the average age of the book dealer there was probably 65 or so.

55:06.440 --> 55:16.674
And we, at our first meetings, you know, were just, I felt so uncomfortable because there was nobody there I really thought I had anything in common with, except we all were in the same business.

55:17.254 --> 55:23.683
And today, if you go to the meetings, and there are certainly so many more members in Southern California than there were then,

55:23.900 --> 55:26.427
There are lots of people younger than me, older than me.

55:26.487 --> 55:27.931
Most of them are younger than me.

55:27.952 --> 55:31.241
So I'm probably considered old for the book business these days.

55:31.261 --> 55:33.608
I think the whole book business has changed.

55:33.648 --> 55:37.318
You see some in their 20s and now in their 30s, which amazes me.

55:37.338 --> 55:38.702
But I guess...

55:39.593 --> 55:47.967
You really aren't... You were very honest and candid, and you said you came into this really looking for a way to make a living.

55:49.048 --> 55:49.289
Exactly.

55:49.429 --> 55:51.532
Not because of any passion for books.

55:51.953 --> 55:57.382
I got out of... When I was discharged from the service, I had saved through... Maybe that's the way to do it.

55:57.442 --> 55:59.385
Maybe you shouldn't have the passion for books.

56:00.106 --> 56:02.750
If I had the passion for books, I probably couldn't sell them.

56:03.872 --> 56:04.653
Do you agree with that?

56:05.415 --> 56:06.276
If you had a passion for books...

56:06.627 --> 56:09.771
Well, there are booksellers that are, I think, closet collectors.

56:10.352 --> 56:11.353
Oh, there are quite a few.

56:11.373 --> 56:11.473
Yeah.

56:11.614 --> 56:19.124
In fact, my theory is they're all closet collectors, except for Venn and I. This fellow wanted this book because it's printed on blue paper.

56:19.304 --> 56:20.005
Very unusual.

56:21.026 --> 56:22.148
Now, what is the book?

56:22.168 --> 56:23.870
It's a classic, one of the classics.

56:23.890 --> 56:26.273
It's a 17th century classic, but printed on blue paper.

56:26.293 --> 56:28.136
I think that's not the original.

56:28.276 --> 56:29.517
No, no, no.

56:30.238 --> 56:32.922
It's just very unusually printed on blue paper.

56:34.117 --> 56:39.146
Ben was saying that, ask him why.

56:39.186 --> 56:43.393
Maybe he has a different answer.

56:44.835 --> 56:47.299
You're such successful booksellers.

56:47.560 --> 56:49.142
You just found out how unsuccessful.

56:49.183 --> 56:53.450
You just found out we only grossed 25% of the minimum you anticipated.

56:53.730 --> 56:55.333
That's not bad money, though.

56:56.194 --> 56:59.500
I feel like we just lost 15 or 16 million.

56:59.665 --> 57:02.148
You go to the Garden Sale.

57:02.488 --> 57:05.892
I mean, it's just the way it is, and that was supposed to be this, and it was.

57:05.932 --> 57:06.513
It was wonderful.

57:06.573 --> 57:11.138
I'm starting my book with that sale, you know, with Dick Manning by the Shakespeare's, and you were probably there.

57:12.940 --> 57:17.045
But, you know, that sale totals $16 million for 314 lots.

57:17.625 --> 57:27.917
The night before that sale gets underway, on a Wednesday night, a Japanese collector spends $21 million for a de Kooning, a living artist.

57:28.336 --> 57:30.399
So everything is relative.

57:30.419 --> 57:32.583
All right, so the book business is not... Well, I'll tell you one thing.

57:32.603 --> 57:38.593
I mean, maybe what you should have done is sell paintings, you know.

57:40.876 --> 57:46.706
But you know, you asked somebody like Steve Massey from Christie's, you said, Stephen, what collections are coming up?

57:47.067 --> 57:48.208
Great collections.

57:48.589 --> 57:51.053
You can count them on one hand, how many left in the country like that.

57:51.404 --> 57:52.667
Either two or three.

57:52.688 --> 58:01.632
We say that, but, you know, South East has a pretty interesting sale coming up, a one-person sale in October, I'm told, and I forget the name, it's in my other notebook.

58:01.652 --> 58:03.477
You don't mean Coke, do you?

58:03.497 --> 58:05.383
No, Coke was a bust.

58:05.403 --> 58:07.388
Oh, yeah, well, of course, it was brought in most of his stuff.

58:07.520 --> 58:07.900
Yeah.

58:07.941 --> 58:08.782
Were you at that sale?

58:08.802 --> 58:09.082
No.

58:09.102 --> 58:10.724
That was in London, was it?

58:10.744 --> 58:12.306
No, that was at Christie's.

58:12.587 --> 58:13.448
That was a bust.

58:13.468 --> 58:15.010
That was barely a million dollars.

58:15.030 --> 58:17.473
I mean, and Coke was there.

58:17.693 --> 58:17.994
Yeah.

58:18.014 --> 58:20.237
I mean, I was with Bart Auerbach.

58:20.257 --> 58:22.359
I'm surprised he didn't stop collecting it, at least.

58:22.379 --> 58:23.781
Well, I think he basically has.

58:24.242 --> 58:27.506
Well, he shifted them, let's go to the least.

58:27.526 --> 58:29.008
Well, he bought awfully aggressive.

58:29.028 --> 58:30.490
He was quite aggressive.

58:30.858 --> 58:35.623
The feeling was that the stuff, the quote is too fresh in the market.

58:36.824 --> 58:37.244
That's true.

58:37.384 --> 58:39.146
It's much more interesting.

58:39.166 --> 58:41.348
He just bought it, and why the hell is he selling it so soon?

58:41.628 --> 58:54.381
If there was another bookshop for sale, an antiquarian bookshop in New York City, it had a stock worth a million dollars, and there was one in Los Angeles worth a million dollars, and I could buy them both, I would never consider the one in Los Angeles, because all my clients have seen it.

58:54.401 --> 58:56.983
I'd jump at the opportunity to consider one in New York.

58:57.132 --> 58:59.495
You mean to buy the books?

58:59.575 --> 59:00.497
To buy the books, too.

59:00.517 --> 59:01.658
I'm saying to buy a freshman, too.

59:01.678 --> 59:02.940
It's the same thing.

59:03.000 --> 59:04.382
It's too recently on the market.

59:04.402 --> 59:05.284
It's been exposed.

59:05.724 --> 59:07.086
Everything is traceable in that sale.

59:07.106 --> 59:07.547
They could tell.

59:07.567 --> 59:08.849
The Poverdines is right here.

59:08.889 --> 59:09.870
Everything came through.

59:09.890 --> 59:11.252
It was recently purchased.
