WEBVTT

00:02.714 --> 00:05.138
and about your connection, if you will.

00:05.158 --> 00:08.563
And you can treat this off the record or on the record, however you want to do it.

00:08.583 --> 00:13.069
I'm really looking at information to try and characterize Haven or more.

00:13.089 --> 00:16.214
Well, we had none whatsoever, or none to speak of.

00:16.274 --> 00:30.175
I think maybe he came across shop once or twice, and he bought one or two books from us a long time ago when he was beginning, but he was very much a customer of college, who was great spending years, as you can tell from the catalog.

00:30.195 --> 00:31.897
That's right.

00:31.917 --> 00:32.178
That's right.

00:32.198 --> 00:32.518
I'm saying that.

00:32.718 --> 00:38.966
You should try and see Nicholas Poole Wilson as well.

00:38.986 --> 00:41.049
I met Nicholas at the sale.

00:42.290 --> 00:51.122
Yeah, because when I was sort of chatting, I was able to get more out of Nicholas and I was able to ask that.

00:51.142 --> 00:51.442
I respect that.

00:51.462 --> 00:51.862
Yeah, absolutely.

00:51.882 --> 00:52.103
Absolutely.

00:52.123 --> 00:55.928
I mean, I find that even money stops buying in a way.

00:55.948 --> 01:00.013
He brought a lot from John Fleming, by the way.

01:00.033 --> 01:00.113
Yes.

01:00.133 --> 01:01.695
Fleming had a wonderful quote.

01:02.350 --> 01:08.239
which I've documented from several sources, you have to forgive him.

01:08.259 --> 01:09.782
So I think of that effect.

01:09.802 --> 01:19.096
Well, indeed Arthur came up with exactly the same quote, and then the same emphasis to him, I think.

01:19.116 --> 01:25.085
Colin Franklin in England as well also did a lot with him, but Colin's most discreet.

01:25.105 --> 01:29.312
Isn't that what you had on to Colin and Riley?

01:29.332 --> 01:30.113
No, absolutely true.

01:31.072 --> 01:33.775
I think I'm talking to the people I have learned.

01:33.855 --> 01:38.019
But what part is your interest to look into it?

01:38.039 --> 01:42.744
How do you know that Hayler No More is a facilitated name?

01:43.865 --> 01:44.926
Have No More?

01:44.946 --> 01:45.206
Come on.

01:45.347 --> 01:50.612
And especially with a curriculum vitae, such as the one he suggested.

01:50.692 --> 01:54.296
It's just all what happened like.

01:54.316 --> 01:58.480
But did somebody you know actually research the genealogy that he

01:58.780 --> 02:09.055
I didn't go to Stonewall Jackson, but as soon as I discovered that his nonsense about the 4th century Celtics was a complete figment, I didn't see much point in going any further.

02:09.075 --> 02:15.364
But nobody has been able to ascertain whether or not there was, in fact, a Celtic king by the name of Haven O'Moore.

02:15.424 --> 02:18.729
There was definitely no Celtic king called Haven O'Moore.

02:18.969 --> 02:26.860
If you think about it, in the 4th century, people in Celts, people in Ireland, wherever, they wouldn't have been called Haven O'Moore.

02:26.920 --> 02:28.703
That's a 19th century name.

02:29.206 --> 02:33.714
I mean, all those own names, the 19th century English interpretations of Gavis' names.

02:34.976 --> 02:35.697
It's wonderful.

02:35.978 --> 02:42.710
Yeah, and the only people known from that time are characters of religion.

02:42.730 --> 02:47.378
You know, the Finn McCool types, that's something they're going that far back.

02:47.398 --> 02:49.622
He also claimed kinship with Sir Thomas More.

02:50.043 --> 02:51.265
That's right, that's right, thank you.

02:51.802 --> 02:54.906
That doesn't really, yes.

02:56.567 --> 03:01.393
Sir Thomas More's family, again, I'm not a historian, I've got no idea.

03:01.413 --> 03:05.418
But that would almost mean that Sir Thomas More was a descendant of Haven no more.

03:05.758 --> 03:07.640
That's right, and Stonewall Jackson.

03:07.660 --> 03:12.666
I mean, if you bothered to spend some time with genealogists, I'm sure it wouldn't take long to blow that away.

03:12.806 --> 03:20.695
What was I?

03:21.198 --> 03:28.232
You were telling me some very interesting things about him, though, that you had gleaned.

03:28.252 --> 03:30.256
You hadn't met him.

03:30.436 --> 03:33.282
I think I met him years and years ago, but he made no question on me.

03:33.302 --> 03:35.927
I think I was introduced to him very, very scripturally at once.

03:35.947 --> 03:43.442
Would you say that your interest in this has really come since the sale?

03:44.317 --> 03:45.298
since the catalogue.

03:45.539 --> 03:52.988
Yes, before that he was a shadowy sort of figure and one didn't really know much about him and people who did do business with him kept it very closely under their chest.

03:53.169 --> 03:55.772
Except that he was clearly a serious collector.

03:55.792 --> 03:56.172
He was.

03:56.293 --> 04:02.080
I mean, the first time his name came to my attention was, I think, with a career of library books.

04:03.302 --> 04:06.546
Was it Harvey or Veselius or something?

04:06.566 --> 04:08.168
Which he really fought.

04:08.188 --> 04:08.929
Well, that's right.

04:09.069 --> 04:13.034
And then later that was in with other stories about him.

04:13.755 --> 04:14.256
One with

04:15.046 --> 04:22.015
This one is off the record because I don't know the details of it.

04:22.035 --> 04:28.023
The bank lost his bank draft on a commission, a large commission purchase, which they were doing at a low rate.

04:28.383 --> 04:34.371
The bank lost his draft, there's no question it arrived or anything, and he refused to issue a new one.

04:35.009 --> 04:39.954
You know, it was an indication of being really neurotic about the whole thing.

04:39.974 --> 04:45.279
And certainly the career of the library thing was totally out of order.

04:45.560 --> 04:47.902
They actually had to get together with people.

04:47.922 --> 04:48.883
It was like a meeting.

04:48.903 --> 04:50.104
I'm sure, I'm sure.

04:50.124 --> 04:52.227
The tens of thousands of dollars for legal fees.

04:52.267 --> 04:54.849
This other fellow picked up the book on Wall Street.

04:54.869 --> 04:57.131
[Speaking.]

05:02.920 --> 05:15.283
I mean, bibliomania is often described as a disease, but not so often clearly seen as a religious disorder.

05:15.303 --> 05:17.387
Do you see bibliomania?

05:17.407 --> 05:18.870
I mean, basically my book

05:19.660 --> 05:23.805
is about bibliomania, productive bibliomania.

05:23.825 --> 05:27.429
I think it's going to be very productive.

05:27.529 --> 05:42.006
But bibliomania is a word you've got to use carefully, like any mania, because it obviously has a, you know, archaic is when it has a definite medical, psychological meaning, and just a passion for collecting isn't bibliomania.

05:42.172 --> 05:51.092
that can be explained in all sorts of ways, whereas the bibliomanic is someone who is completely obsessed by it.

05:51.112 --> 05:53.818
Have you seen many of those?

05:54.355 --> 06:01.561
I mean, yes, one does know a handful of people whose lives are entirely dominated by dogs.

06:01.582 --> 06:08.728
And these are the people for whom acquisition is the important thing.

06:08.748 --> 06:12.812
One keeps the tales of people who buy books and they literally never open them.

06:12.832 --> 06:13.853
They just have to keep acquiring that.

06:13.873 --> 06:20.218
I'm really interested in the collector who is responsible, really, for, and he may be obsessed.

06:21.940 --> 06:23.221
That's fine.

06:23.241 --> 06:24.362
But he has pretty much.

06:25.810 --> 06:37.626
Well, what I would love to know is who Mr. Wilmore was before he was asked for it more.

06:37.646 --> 06:38.527
Um, Nicholas Kool-Wilson Arthur.

06:38.547 --> 06:38.647
Okay.

06:38.668 --> 06:41.391
That he was Chris and Haven Moore.

06:41.411 --> 06:42.353
Well, Stephen Moore.

06:42.673 --> 06:44.696
Yeah.

06:44.716 --> 06:46.558
That's just a speculation.

06:46.578 --> 06:46.678
Yeah.

06:46.698 --> 06:48.441
They don't know where he's from, though.

06:48.481 --> 06:55.090
What interests me is he claims he goes back 16 centuries or so, but he wants to tell you where he was born.

06:55.110 --> 06:55.210
Yeah.

06:55.342 --> 06:57.845
I would just kind of like to know where he went to school.

06:57.865 --> 06:58.326
Absolutely, absolutely.

06:58.386 --> 06:59.768
I'd like to know if he went to university.

06:59.868 --> 07:01.370
I don't think he did, by the way.

07:01.390 --> 07:06.717
I do believe he had a wife prior to this one, and he does have children in that marriage.

07:08.339 --> 07:10.362
If you can now go down to a town, it would help.

07:10.522 --> 07:17.572
Well, I do know that the current wife is from Kentucky, and they've been married for at least 70 years.

07:18.273 --> 07:21.797
So, yeah, I'm putting it together.

07:21.817 --> 07:23.880
Yeah, it'll come, it'll come, it'll come.

07:24.130 --> 07:25.211
quite wonderful.

07:25.351 --> 07:26.493
Yes, yes, yes.

07:26.753 --> 07:34.822
And the story becomes more exciting.

07:35.242 --> 07:36.283
What's out there?

07:36.303 --> 07:47.616
There's a book collector there who, as far as, I mean, not hugely wealthy, very comfortable, and not the greatest book collection in the world, but a very nice one.

07:47.636 --> 07:50.779
And I won't even tell you anything about him, just that you've enjoyed him.

07:51.552 --> 07:57.019
Steven Cox, James Stevens.

07:57.039 --> 07:57.980
S-T-E-P-H?

07:58.180 --> 08:00.043
V. S-T-E-V-E-N-S.

08:00.303 --> 08:03.246
And what kind of collection is it?

08:03.267 --> 08:06.651
Oh, large.

08:06.671 --> 08:08.353
And how do I get there?

08:08.373 --> 08:10.215
Dock Lane.

08:10.235 --> 08:13.539
Obviously I can't do it as a strip, but would it be worth my attention?

08:13.940 --> 08:18.986
If you're interested in a sort of small eccentric personality to book collecting, yeah.

08:19.006 --> 08:20.648
But is it an important collection?

08:21.556 --> 08:26.163
Yes, he's a very good person, but not a person.

08:26.183 --> 08:27.425
And the focus is what?

08:27.445 --> 08:28.326
He hasn't done that.

08:28.346 --> 08:29.428
Is that one of his charms?

08:29.909 --> 08:31.652
Yes, very much so.

08:31.672 --> 08:33.274
I'm one of the personal charms.

08:33.294 --> 08:34.616
He's close to being a busy mania.

08:36.479 --> 08:38.041
And is he accessible?

08:38.061 --> 08:40.525
Yeah, yeah, fairly accessible.

08:40.545 --> 08:42.028
Outwater, you just get his phone number?

08:42.068 --> 08:42.969
Yeah, yeah.

08:42.989 --> 08:45.533
And what's the name of the place that he is?

08:45.553 --> 08:46.855
He's in Guernsey, in China.

08:48.353 --> 08:56.322
S-U-E-R-N, S-U-I, and all I do is call UMZ directing assistance there and ask for his phone number.

08:56.783 --> 08:59.006
Yeah, yeah.

08:59.106 --> 09:00.427
Can you hang him up?

09:00.447 --> 09:02.370
Yeah, do, do, do.

09:02.390 --> 09:04.452
He's great.

09:04.472 --> 09:07.376
How difficult was it to get there from here?

09:07.396 --> 09:08.397
Oh, it's 90 minutes.

09:08.957 --> 09:09.618
90 minutes?

09:09.778 --> 09:09.879
Yeah.

09:09.899 --> 09:10.960
Okay, I can't do it this trip.

09:11.060 --> 09:11.320
Yeah, yeah.

09:11.340 --> 09:12.181
Well, yeah, next time.

09:12.642 --> 09:13.283
Next time.

09:13.303 --> 09:15.165
I think I'm coming back in August or September.

09:15.185 --> 09:17.027
I was in France yesterday,

09:17.395 --> 09:22.442
really just to get color on one collection, the Carlton Lake Collection from the University of Texas, which is French.

09:23.184 --> 09:26.569
But I really had to go to France to get an evaluation of it.

09:26.989 --> 09:33.939
I mean, having people in the United States say it's the greatest collection of French stuff outside of France is really worth it.

09:33.959 --> 09:36.904
I have to have somebody at the University of Texas.

09:36.924 --> 09:38.686
And I was saying that, and I did.

09:38.706 --> 09:43.033
Well, tell me a little bit more about, well, it's going to be a good book.

09:43.133 --> 09:46.558
And anything that I quote you on, by the way.

09:47.348 --> 09:49.311
I'll run it by you.

09:49.332 --> 09:51.555
Sure, but I'd much appreciate that.

09:51.575 --> 09:55.102
You know, this is done, everything I do is up and up.

09:55.122 --> 10:00.972
I never secretly take you to the people I ask them if I can take you to the people.

10:00.992 --> 10:01.333
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:01.353 --> 10:02.655
Well, we've got to ask you to, it's like New York.

10:02.735 --> 10:10.088
Yeah, well, but the point is, you know, if people don't want to be taped, that's fine.

10:10.108 --> 10:10.770
But, yeah.

10:10.790 --> 10:12.192
Give me a little bit more insight.

10:12.712 --> 10:28.473
Oh, I haven't got any valuable insight on that at all, but I think the real bibliomaniac is the person who finds the acquisition more important than the possession, even.

10:28.973 --> 10:37.444
I mean, the stories are very true of the collectors whose houses ultimately become so full of books that you can't even get them.

10:37.464 --> 10:38.426
Yeah, Heber has seven mansions.

10:38.446 --> 10:38.946
That's right, yeah.

10:39.387 --> 10:41.790
Or like Thomas Phillips, I think you can mark it.

10:41.990 --> 10:44.834
their collections had a purpose, didn't they?

10:44.855 --> 10:48.300
I mean, there are things that I am sure that Phillips preserved.

10:49.121 --> 10:51.225
There was a caxton.

10:51.425 --> 10:53.949
Well, that is to be found no place else.

10:53.969 --> 11:01.000
This is a great justification of collecting, that at times it can seem like a silly little game.

11:02.582 --> 11:07.110
You know, it's appealed only to the collecting instincts in people.

11:07.130 --> 11:09.313
But then at other times it is...

11:09.597 --> 11:16.190
the terribly important way of preserving knowledge because all of those things are trashed.

11:17.412 --> 11:22.181
Well, if you go into the British Library, you go to English literature, case number one.

11:22.241 --> 11:27.151
Here's the only known copy available.

11:27.171 --> 11:28.954
Cotton.

11:28.994 --> 11:30.998
Someone made a big fuss about it a long time ago.

11:31.349 --> 11:39.817
And because of that, he survived.

11:39.917 --> 11:40.257
That's right.

11:40.317 --> 11:43.260
He was a collector.

11:43.280 --> 11:45.562
He was, you know, how do you see the wind is firing basketball?

11:45.582 --> 11:46.964
That's a pattern in the industry.

11:46.984 --> 11:48.365
That's right.

11:48.385 --> 11:48.905
He was a collector.

11:48.925 --> 11:49.406
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:49.426 --> 11:50.187
I may well not have survived.

11:50.207 --> 11:53.009
Well, I think for sure it probably wouldn't have been.

11:53.029 --> 11:55.131
This staff was from the monasteries that were destroyed.

11:55.151 --> 11:56.453
God only knows what was.

11:56.473 --> 11:58.775
Destroyed and what didn't make it, you know.

11:58.795 --> 11:58.935
Mm-hmm.

11:58.955 --> 11:59.095
Mm-hmm.

11:59.885 --> 12:00.425
Okay.

12:00.866 --> 12:01.366
Well, I've got to run.

12:01.386 --> 12:02.748
I've got to meet this person.

12:03.728 --> 12:05.190
I'd like to talk to you again.

12:05.630 --> 12:07.151
Yeah, sure, do.

12:07.172 --> 12:08.713
It is a hectic day today, I'm afraid.

12:08.733 --> 12:15.439
I've just got my... Would you... This Texas stuff, which are very important, the British Library.

12:15.459 --> 12:18.001
This Texas stuff is very, very interesting to me.

12:18.121 --> 12:29.031
And as I went to France to get an evaluation of the French collection there, I really have to talk to people here in England for an evaluation of British stuff in Texas.

12:29.264 --> 12:31.166
And I just made a very interesting comment.

12:31.186 --> 12:37.593
You said that what you know is that in the 50s and the 60s, they were buying everything that you wanted.

12:37.813 --> 12:39.775
Did you say that again, perhaps?

12:39.795 --> 12:47.623
What I meant was that in the 50s and 60s, things started to fetch high prices in the sale rooms.

12:48.164 --> 12:56.773
And the things that fetched the highest prices normally went to Texas, because there was so much more money there than I was here at that time.

12:56.956 --> 12:59.000
Because I wasn't here in the 50s.

12:59.020 --> 13:01.504
I didn't come there in the 65s.

13:02.065 --> 13:07.876
But fine, perhaps the early to mid-60s, and even though I'm not in the 70s.

13:08.096 --> 13:12.945
But I do remember going to the sale rooms with my damn boss and bidding for things.

13:13.025 --> 13:17.293
And we had absolutely no hope because then there would be an agency

13:17.662 --> 13:19.724
It was buying for taxes.

13:19.745 --> 13:23.209
And it was British stuff that you wanted for the British Library.

13:23.409 --> 13:30.958
Particularly, I mean, I was interested in buying them since then, and they bought a lot of very fine linings in that period.

13:31.118 --> 13:38.387
And of course what they also did, and I was very sensible, they bought English literary manuscripts in which people in England were also interested.

13:39.565 --> 13:47.515
And it is only, sadly, recently that the English has woken up the fact that modern authors' manuscripts are of interest.

13:47.575 --> 13:48.957
Could you give a few examples?

13:48.977 --> 13:53.824
Well, Robert Graves' manuscripts, for example, went to Texas.

13:55.466 --> 14:02.254
And there were lots of English-living authors who sold their manuscripts to Texas.

14:02.274 --> 14:04.858
And they couldn't sell them here, because nobody would be interested.

14:04.878 --> 14:08.863
Well, was there an attitude that nobody was really buying the stuff of living authors?

14:09.586 --> 14:11.628
And that's held sway for many, many years.

14:11.728 --> 14:11.988
It has.

14:12.008 --> 14:13.369
This is almost a recent phenomenon.

14:13.409 --> 14:15.171
Yeah, it is a very recent phenomenon.

14:15.191 --> 14:19.475
Oh, no, there was the attitude that as long as the person was alive, it could be interesting virtually.

14:19.495 --> 14:26.260
You know, really started to buy people's literary inheritance, you know, if they'd been there for a good long time.

14:26.280 --> 14:27.421
People have changed now.

14:27.461 --> 14:33.186
I think now the current feeling is that it was actually quite sad that all that material went abroad.

14:33.206 --> 14:35.528
Although people realized it was their own fault.

14:35.989 --> 14:38.631
But it is also suggested in some circles

14:39.016 --> 14:49.108
in the States, at least, people who are admittedly critical of Texas, or maybe, as Nicholas has suggested, perhaps jealous of Texas.

14:49.449 --> 14:51.251
He's very admired.

14:51.271 --> 14:55.957
Well, I think what they've done, it's probably, you know, they were very sensible.

14:56.077 --> 15:00.082
They had the money, and they bought what they could get.

15:00.102 --> 15:02.846
And whatever the price was, they had the stuff.

15:02.866 --> 15:05.168
And it certainly went more today than it was then.

15:05.289 --> 15:07.291
Absolutely.

15:07.491 --> 15:08.112
But to finish,

15:08.463 --> 15:20.101
A lot of people have suggested, some people have suggested, but these people also have access to crime too, so I have to factor in who the people are.

15:20.121 --> 15:22.945
I'm not taking everything at Facebook.

15:22.965 --> 15:23.386
No, it can't.

15:23.406 --> 15:25.789
I really want this to be a very accurate quote.

15:26.170 --> 15:29.114
But they do say that they bought a lot of junk.

15:29.134 --> 15:32.319
They are in the process of buying a lot of good stuff.

15:32.339 --> 15:34.362
It's almost unavoidable, isn't it?

15:34.382 --> 15:36.225
They cast a wide net, shall we say.

15:37.150 --> 15:45.738
but even some living authors who were obscure then and remained obscure.

15:46.079 --> 15:50.002
Well, maybe in a hundred years time it's become very interesting.

15:50.022 --> 15:55.407
I mean, now we go to raptures over 16th century authors nobody's ever heard of.

15:55.428 --> 15:55.748
Really?

15:55.768 --> 15:55.868
Yeah.

15:56.889 --> 15:59.111
What are Canadian discoveries?

15:59.191 --> 16:06.398
You do suddenly get, there have been in historical sets of papers,

16:07.373 --> 16:16.525
There have been discoveries of literary manuscripts, of different subjects of the poets.

16:16.545 --> 16:21.072
There's one that, well, hardly heard of.

16:21.332 --> 16:24.957
Simply because they never wrote much, never published much, never large editions.

16:25.097 --> 16:28.101
Noughts among the class, you see.

16:28.121 --> 16:32.006
I'm trying to be realising that this is actually very interesting literary history.

16:32.026 --> 16:36.132
What happens, a scholar is going through archival material, manuscript stuff, and

16:36.500 --> 16:39.443
I'm just, maybe you can tell me how the process works, what happens.

16:40.104 --> 16:45.871
How does such a reexamination take place?

16:45.891 --> 16:49.916
I think when they turn up in large collections of papers.

16:49.936 --> 17:04.633
We've had here that we've bought large collections of papers and somebody in the management department went through it with a very fine tooth and actually discovered some quite interesting poems or essays.

17:05.575 --> 17:07.899
by somebody whom he might have just heard off.

17:08.259 --> 17:10.483
And this occasions a re-evaluation?

17:11.184 --> 17:11.504
Yes.

17:11.745 --> 17:12.867
I know this is difficult.

17:12.927 --> 17:16.853
We're just talking here, but can you think of anyone?

17:17.494 --> 17:18.075
Could you think of a name?

17:18.095 --> 17:19.056
I can't think of a name.

17:19.778 --> 17:22.983
The person you asked would be Hilton Callagher.

17:23.003 --> 17:25.947
So I'll make sure we're waiting.

17:25.968 --> 17:27.270
Yep, we are.

17:27.350 --> 17:27.510
Okay.

17:27.530 --> 17:27.851
Hilton?

17:27.871 --> 17:29.353
Callagher.

17:29.373 --> 17:31.596
How do we spell that?

17:31.617 --> 17:31.937
K-E-L-L-I-H-E-R.

17:33.318 --> 18:00.608
Because it does, again, illumin... ...which may seem scary.

18:01.567 --> 18:10.040
You know, they have put together an extraordinary collection of 20th century archive of material.

18:10.060 --> 18:14.187
They really have focused, for the most part, on 20th century stuff.

18:14.207 --> 18:19.595
Because they felt, perhaps quite correctly, there was nothing else available.

18:19.675 --> 18:21.157
That was where their opportunity was.

18:21.178 --> 18:21.658
That's right.

18:21.979 --> 18:23.421
Because nobody was much interested.

18:23.521 --> 18:25.584
Therefore, they might not be interested.

18:25.604 --> 18:27.928
But also, all the great things were really

18:28.702 --> 18:30.924
You couldn't really become another British library.

18:30.944 --> 18:32.105
You couldn't become a Huntington.

18:32.125 --> 18:33.286
You couldn't become a Morgan.

18:33.306 --> 18:34.267
You couldn't become a Hovland.

18:34.287 --> 18:37.570
On the other hand, they bought some of my vacant central things as well.

18:37.630 --> 18:42.635
I mean, in a way of binding, they bought some historical things.

18:42.655 --> 18:42.835
I saw it.

18:42.855 --> 18:43.456
Have you been there?

18:43.536 --> 18:51.163
No, I've now made about three times that I've made plans to go in something in the leaves that I couldn't go.

18:51.183 --> 18:53.525
But one day, I will come back.

18:53.565 --> 18:55.907
They told me in Texas, a number of people that,

18:56.410 --> 19:03.960
Now, I think Great Britain passed a law on the exportation of certain medical materials, prohibiting it.

19:05.165 --> 19:05.326
Yes.

19:05.346 --> 19:06.370
Well, there is.

19:07.615 --> 19:13.721
You need a license, export license, when something is over a certain amount.

19:14.181 --> 19:16.664
So it's really monetary more than anything else.

19:16.684 --> 19:20.748
Yes, the amount is fairly low, therefore it catches the interesting thing.

19:20.768 --> 19:23.430
This prohibits it or requires study?

19:23.450 --> 19:28.936
No, it does require a national institution to buy it instead.

19:28.956 --> 19:31.438
So if you have the option to buy it or to buy it?

19:31.558 --> 19:32.459
No, to buy it.

19:32.479 --> 19:35.462
So if somebody doesn't buy it, it will then leave.

19:35.948 --> 19:36.689
At that price.

19:36.909 --> 19:38.911
At that price.

19:38.931 --> 19:42.574
Texas believes that this law has passed because of Texas.

19:42.594 --> 19:49.480
Do you think that's... I think it's a general realization.

19:49.500 --> 19:51.542
Yeah, because it applies to all sorts of things.

19:51.562 --> 19:54.405
I mean, it applies to armor and paintings.

19:54.425 --> 19:59.810
It's a fairly recent... No, the painting business has been done over ages.

19:59.830 --> 20:03.213
They have extended it.

20:03.273 --> 20:05.635
And books and manuscripts.

20:06.661 --> 20:26.229
I think, joined in later, I think, but I think for artifacts, this is what has been done with the Bible on the ground.

20:26.249 --> 20:28.232
One of the people I've interviewed in the States is William Scheide.

20:28.252 --> 20:28.592
Yes, yes, I know.

20:28.612 --> 20:29.233
He has a paper collection, too.

20:29.253 --> 20:30.154
Isn't it interesting now?

20:30.214 --> 20:35.402
He knows, you talk about, he's more of a 19th century guy.

20:35.422 --> 20:36.263
I don't have to report that necessarily.

20:38.926 --> 20:42.434
The people resent Texas for this stuff.

20:42.455 --> 20:45.722
I don't know if the BBC did do.

20:45.743 --> 20:46.805
I really don't know.

20:46.825 --> 20:55.045
I think some people might have resented out of sort of theology because sex was given money and institutionalism.

20:56.020 --> 21:21.690
And in retrospect, people might have resented that all the 50 manuscripts went, but I think we were there to blame, to let them go, because if we wanted them, people would have... I do remember a feeling of sort of people thinking, you know, all these wonderful things, isn't it a shame they all go abroad.

21:22.582 --> 21:27.328
But I think resentment, I think resentment has been very close to jealousy, really.

21:28.649 --> 21:39.162
But not resentment that they were leaving your shores and going... Well, yes, I mean, sadness that they were leaving, leaving the country.

21:39.182 --> 21:39.703
But not anger.

21:39.723 --> 21:40.584
At some point, yes.

21:40.604 --> 21:48.994
I know in the BBC, a lot of people who have quoted on their program, these things are going, quote, to the deserts of Austin.

21:49.379 --> 21:50.060
No.

21:50.601 --> 21:55.788
Well, of course at that time nobody had much heard of it as the centre of culture, let's put it that way.

21:55.808 --> 22:00.054
People probably thought, you know, it was one big old well.

22:00.074 --> 22:03.018
You know, it is an oasis, certainly, there isn't much there.

22:03.478 --> 22:08.926
But I'll tell you, when I was around there, there were a lot of people going to do it.

22:09.567 --> 22:11.109
Oh, now people go and visit it.

22:11.249 --> 22:12.451
I think it might be a way to do it.

22:12.471 --> 22:13.732
They were doing research.

22:13.752 --> 22:14.914
Yes, I mean visiting for research.

22:15.265 --> 22:21.875
But it might have been originally that people felt, you know, it's a long way away, and all these wonderful things are going.

22:22.395 --> 22:29.165
A lot of people do resent, and I think justifiably, that they do require you to come here.

22:29.185 --> 22:30.567
I don't think that they're very viewable.

22:30.587 --> 22:32.330
No, no microfilms and no photocopies.

22:32.350 --> 22:42.825
I once went to a very interesting talk by Dekatana on why they didn't allow photocopies in microfilms.

22:43.143 --> 22:53.097
Well, he said, I don't agree with this, but he said that the literary document has its value as a unique document.

22:53.117 --> 22:57.083
And the moment you start making copies, it lost its value as a unique document.

22:57.103 --> 23:00.467
Well, I think that's a very narrow way to tell you myself.

23:00.648 --> 23:01.729
And I don't believe in it.

23:01.769 --> 23:03.331
But that was a justification.

23:03.752 --> 23:11.202
That's a rationalization to require people to come to Texas and to use that to stay on the floor.

23:11.222 --> 23:12.424
And in so doing...

23:13.265 --> 23:14.693
give them a little more sleep.

23:14.714 --> 23:17.631
Yeah, they probably need people to calm.

23:17.651 --> 23:18.134
They're desperate.

23:18.234 --> 23:20.608
And I think that's what it's all about.
