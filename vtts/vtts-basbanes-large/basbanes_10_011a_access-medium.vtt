WEBVTT

00:03.237 --> 00:06.541
We're talking to Barney Rosenthal in Berkeley.

00:06.561 --> 00:08.643
Go ahead, you were going to say something?

00:09.524 --> 00:17.913
No, I'm just wondering what there is that I can tell you and what the direction of your... And I'm just taping it because then I'll know where we started.

00:19.876 --> 00:28.205
This is the first interview for my next book, and I think, as I indicated to you, I think a showcase chapter will be... Yes.

00:29.326 --> 00:32.890
I would like to give some flesh and blood to the...

00:33.157 --> 00:42.248
to the frame that you provided for us here, I would like to go out and tell some of the stories of some of these people that you... Yes.

00:42.428 --> 00:45.752
It's a great story, I believe, certainly, of your lecture.

00:46.352 --> 00:47.754
Yeah.

00:47.774 --> 00:53.421
Said to me, said to Roger Stoddard, Roger is the one who's urging me to do this, by the way.

00:54.041 --> 00:54.262
I see.

00:54.282 --> 00:57.365
Well, I couldn't get a more flattering reference.

00:57.425 --> 00:59.788
He said, get Bernie's lecture.

00:59.828 --> 01:01.610
I said, I have Bernie's lecture.

01:02.091 --> 01:03.012
And he said...

01:03.785 --> 01:05.148
And then just take it from there.

01:05.168 --> 01:06.991
So I guess we just start.

01:09.476 --> 01:12.863
Maybe we can just start a little bit of a biographical background.

01:13.324 --> 01:15.668
I know some of it, but you are the son of a bookseller.

01:15.809 --> 01:16.029
Yes.

01:16.049 --> 01:18.674
And that is, maybe you could tell me a little bit about your own history.

01:18.795 --> 01:21.540
And this will go any direction that you want.

01:22.162 --> 01:34.990
Well, I can certainly do that, and it just so happens that I finished an autobiographical sketch that I wrote for my son and some of my relatives, and if you want to, I'll give you a copy of that, because that will be something that you can refer to in a...

01:35.172 --> 01:38.817
And don't feel that you have to repeat information that's in there either.

01:39.258 --> 01:44.025
Okay, well... Maybe for the purposes of this conversation, you could tell me some pertinent things.

01:44.045 --> 01:53.779
Okay, well, I'll emphasize the book part, obviously, because I, contrary to popular opinion, I have lots of relatives who are not booksellers.

01:54.300 --> 02:00.949
But both my grandfathers were booksellers, and very prominent booksellers.

02:01.650 --> 02:04.234
And also one great-grandfather on the German side.

02:05.227 --> 02:17.470
And then my father, who was Jacques Rosenthal's son, this is my paternal grandfather Jacques.

02:17.490 --> 02:20.175
You're pointing to a picture on the wall as you do this.

02:20.235 --> 02:24.062
Yes, that's a portrait of my grandfather Jacques done by

02:24.903 --> 02:28.366
a then very famous painter, Lenbach, in Munich in 1904.

02:28.406 --> 02:30.008
How would you spell that?

02:30.949 --> 02:32.710
L-E-N-B-A-C-H.

02:32.911 --> 02:34.953
And Lenbach was a book collector.

02:36.334 --> 02:41.999
And he asked my grandfather to sit for a portrait.

02:42.059 --> 02:45.182
My grandfather didn't want to, and then finally he was persuaded.

02:45.202 --> 02:47.685
I need a pencil.

02:49.987 --> 02:51.929
I have lots of pencils, by the way, if you need one.

02:52.289 --> 02:54.471
There's one over there, for instance.

02:54.907 --> 02:56.949
Okay.

02:57.410 --> 02:58.091
Take your pick.

03:00.333 --> 03:12.548
And when Lembach was finished with the portrait, my grandfather said, well, you know, I have to pay you what is your fee?

03:12.588 --> 03:23.260
And the fee normally was enormous because he was a famous in-painter at the time, portrait painter, L-E-N-B-A-C-H.

03:24.050 --> 03:29.575
And then I said, no, no, no, if you want to, just give me some books.

03:30.096 --> 03:35.081
And so that's all he took in payment.

03:36.862 --> 03:46.972
Anyway, Jacques Rosenthal, his name was Jacob, but he was a J-A-K-O-B.

03:46.992 --> 03:52.217
And he became a great Francophile in the

03:53.834 --> 03:55.496
days when he was very active.

03:55.536 --> 04:04.525
He spent a lot of time in France, in Paris, and he changed his name to Jacques from Jacob.

04:07.148 --> 04:22.845
So, and my other, my maternal grandfather, you can read that in my little biography, and by the way, did you ever read this, now I'm going off on a tangent, this lecture I gave at Harvard called the Olskys and the Rosenthal's,

04:23.534 --> 04:27.098
Well, that's important, because that'll give you pretty much the background.

04:27.378 --> 04:31.643
Olschke's are my mother's family, and the Rosenthal's my father's family.

04:31.663 --> 04:32.464
That's essential.

04:32.484 --> 04:35.828
And that was published in the Harvard Library Bulletin.

04:35.968 --> 04:38.871
I don't think— I have a spare copy.

04:38.971 --> 04:39.832
Hang on for a minute.

04:39.872 --> 04:42.455
If not, I can get it at the F&AM or at Harvard.

04:42.475 --> 04:48.121
It is O-L-S-C-K-I, Olschke.

04:48.281 --> 04:51.345
O-L-S-C-H-K-I, sorry.

04:51.365 --> 04:51.465
Okay.

04:54.601 --> 04:55.102
I can get it.

04:55.322 --> 04:55.802
Okay.

04:56.843 --> 05:01.328
I believe it was 1977, and it was also reprinted in the A.B.

05:01.348 --> 05:02.189
Bookman's Weekly.

05:02.449 --> 05:05.472
I can't tell you which issue, but about quite a while ago.

05:05.492 --> 05:08.675
I can get it out of the Harvard... Yes, Harvard Library Bulletin.

05:08.695 --> 05:13.300
And I'm sure that either I can write you the data or... Okay, fine.

05:13.320 --> 05:14.361
I'll find it.

05:14.381 --> 05:22.870
And so there I talk about my two grandfathers, mostly, the German side and the Italian side, and how...

05:23.795 --> 05:40.588
They were friends, and some people say that it was a kind of an unarranged marriage, but anyway, whatever it was, it lasted almost sixty years.

05:40.889 --> 05:55.711
They were, they rather dominated, I mean, in Italy, certainly, the book world was, there was only one other bookseller who could sort of hold a candle to my grandfather, Oshki, De Marini's very famous Italian bookseller.

05:55.731 --> 06:00.999
Of course, the years will all be in these essays that you're... Yes, yes, the dates will all be in there.

06:01.620 --> 06:05.706
So, then, I was born in Munich in 1920.

06:06.166 --> 06:08.770
My father had, by that time, joined his father's firm.

06:10.319 --> 06:19.217
And, well, I mean, books were always somehow part of our lives.

06:22.063 --> 06:28.737
But... Did you know that you'd be a book person?

06:28.757 --> 06:29.178
Oh, no.

06:29.398 --> 06:29.759
Oh, no.

06:29.899 --> 06:31.703
I didn't want to be a book person at all.

06:32.341 --> 06:44.701
When I left Germany in 1933, I was 13 years old, and my father was clever enough to see the writing on the wall.

06:45.843 --> 06:56.340
And all of us, the entire family, except his parents, who didn't want to leave, were out of Germany by 1935.

06:56.793 --> 07:00.056
So, and I... Life-saving perception, wasn't it?

07:00.437 --> 07:01.418
It certainly was.

07:01.818 --> 07:02.599
It certainly was.

07:03.340 --> 07:21.418
And then, for me and for one of my two brothers, it was relatively easy, because we just went to Italy and continued school there, because we, being half Italian and having learned Italian from the day we were babies, because mother always sought with her.

07:21.438 --> 07:22.559
We spoke Italian with her.

07:22.579 --> 07:24.741
She wanted us to grow up bilingual.

07:25.244 --> 07:28.728
So we were able to just go from a German school to an Italian school.

07:29.749 --> 07:32.952
It was difficult, but we could manage.

07:34.133 --> 07:37.597
And so then it wasn't until 1939.

07:37.977 --> 07:44.063
I'll make this long story short, because if I give you my autobiographical sketch, you'll see it all.

07:47.406 --> 07:52.872
I came here to Berkeley in 1939 and studied chemistry.

07:53.712 --> 08:03.564
and won a bachelor's degree, and I wasn't really cut out to be a chemist, but becoming a bookseller was certainly the furthest from my mind.

08:03.584 --> 08:06.768
I was sort of interested in books as a kid.

08:06.808 --> 08:10.874
I always bought books in Florence.

08:11.975 --> 08:14.438
When I was a little kid in Florence, I'd go to the

08:14.958 --> 08:23.609
to the people who were selling these sort of cheap paperbacks, and then I'd sneak into my grandfather's shop.

08:24.209 --> 08:30.397
He had his own bindery, and there was an old book binder, and he would bind them in half cloth for me.

08:30.417 --> 08:42.872
And so, you know, so I had, I guess, some kind of feeling for what books are or should be.

08:43.156 --> 08:57.354
And it wasn't until I was 29 years old that I decided to become a bookseller after trying some other careers, because I liked the idea of, not so much because I liked some books particularly, but because I wanted something where I could be my own boss.

08:59.337 --> 09:07.307
And then I liked it from the first day on, and people say, well, of course, you know, you've got books in your blood, but still.

09:08.013 --> 09:12.419
I was 29 years old, as I keep telling people, when I first heard the name of Brunet.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.882
That was, I'd never know.

09:15.803 --> 09:23.954
And sure, I heard the names of Morgan and Carl Koep and Philip Hofer at the dinner table, but that doesn't make you into a bookseller.

09:23.974 --> 09:28.160
The real nitty-gritty is... How about your father in all this?

09:28.180 --> 09:35.910
Did he come to... My father was also a... became... He then, when his father retired and...

09:36.802 --> 09:39.906
thank God, died before things got to be too bad in Germany.

09:40.447 --> 09:44.011
A father took over the business in Munich in 1931 or 1932.

09:44.051 --> 09:49.598
And then in 1935, it was, of course, had to be dissolved.

09:50.540 --> 09:55.646
And then he moved to Switzerland, where we have a firm since 1920.

09:55.806 --> 09:57.509
Again, you'll read all this.

09:58.710 --> 10:01.173
And father carried on as a bookseller.

10:01.373 --> 10:04.918
But he was really... I wrote a

10:05.793 --> 10:17.946
something for him, an obituary, and it occurred to me then, when I was putting all my remembrances together, that he wasn't really happy being a merchant.

10:18.827 --> 10:32.222
He was an esthete, he studied art history, he was a very good art historian, and I always had the feeling that he was sort of forced a little bit by his father, who was very strong, as you can tell.

10:32.675 --> 10:39.884
from the portrait, he was sort of... When did the portrait, the portrait came with the family, of course.

10:39.904 --> 10:41.306
The portrait was done in 1904.

10:41.326 --> 10:43.549
I mean, it moved up.

10:43.649 --> 10:47.393
It moved, we were able to say that, yeah.

10:47.413 --> 10:51.418
And it so happens that it's hanging here now, but it belongs to the family.

10:55.223 --> 11:02.412
So, but my father was quite successful, very successful, as a matter of fact, and one of his great

11:03.488 --> 11:08.755
I must say, friends in this country was Rosenwald, whom you certainly know.

11:08.775 --> 11:13.823
And I remember several trips he and I took together to see Lessing Rosenwald.

11:15.044 --> 11:21.193
And particularly one time when Rosenwald was in California, this was in the 40s,

11:22.203 --> 11:32.698
And he said, well, Dr. Rosenthal, he was always Dr. Rosenthal because he has a PhD in our history, and even we children called our father her doctor.

11:32.738 --> 11:33.118
Really?

11:33.178 --> 11:34.500
Yeah, but come in cheek.

11:36.022 --> 11:39.888
And so Rosenwald said, why don't you come to Los Angeles?

11:39.928 --> 11:40.709
I'd love to see you.

11:40.789 --> 11:45.255
And then so my father said, my God, yes, I have nothing to show this man.

11:45.355 --> 11:48.700
And finally he said, well, um,

11:49.203 --> 11:59.661
I just take something, and he took a group of very remarkable medieval miniatures, illuminations.

11:59.981 --> 12:02.185
But Roosevelt wasn't collecting that at all.

12:02.646 --> 12:06.412
But my father said, well, this is a man who appreciates things, at least I have something to show him.

12:07.454 --> 12:13.624
And so we went to this wonderful hotel, what was he called, in Beverly Hills, of course.

12:13.874 --> 12:15.617
where you had little houses.

12:15.637 --> 12:20.624
Oh, they just, that's, that's, the foreigners just bought that, I think, the, I know the one you mean, the Beverly Hills.

12:20.664 --> 12:22.026
Something, yes.

12:22.046 --> 12:25.612
It was really grand, and Roosevelt was in this little house.

12:25.632 --> 12:27.515
It was being opened after a multi-million.

12:27.535 --> 12:28.937
That, that's, well, yeah.

12:29.898 --> 12:42.137
And so, um, um, and of course those were the days when you went down to Los Angeles with a decent train, luxurious, uh, luxurious roommate and all that sort of thing.

12:42.157 --> 12:43.138
Father always liked to,

12:43.827 --> 12:44.808
travel and style.

12:45.869 --> 12:54.356
And so when we saw Rosenwald, my father showed him these things, and Rosenwald was, he never showed much emotion.

12:54.376 --> 12:56.858
He kept a total poker face when he looked at things.

12:58.400 --> 13:03.024
And he looked at these things, and then they chatted, and then he said, well, thank you very much.

13:04.025 --> 13:06.087
And we wrapped up the miniatures and came home again.

13:06.147 --> 13:13.513
And then a few weeks later, Rosenwald wrote and said, well,

13:14.084 --> 13:16.649
Dad considers selling them our block.

13:17.792 --> 13:22.802
And that was the beginning of the great collection, which is now in the National Gallery of Art.

13:23.223 --> 13:24.726
That was the start of that collection?

13:24.746 --> 13:26.890
And my dad is given full credit in the preface.

13:27.071 --> 13:28.794
I can show it to you if you want to.

13:28.955 --> 13:29.496
I have the preface.

13:29.516 --> 13:29.937
Oh, you have it?

13:30.057 --> 13:30.658
Okay, good.

13:30.892 --> 13:33.676
That's the Rosenwald collection of... I have it.

13:33.696 --> 13:35.739
It's the Szilard paperback book.

13:35.759 --> 13:36.300
Yeah, I have it.

13:36.320 --> 13:37.041
Gosh.

13:37.061 --> 13:38.463
By the way, that's pretty valuable now.

13:39.425 --> 13:41.027
I was looking for a copy for a friend.

13:41.167 --> 13:46.034
That bibliography is my collection right now that I really love.

13:46.435 --> 13:53.986
So my father had these... I think if you're interested in him, and you should be, because, after all, he's the first Rosenthal in America.

13:55.468 --> 13:57.091
I'll give you the... Let me just interject.

13:57.111 --> 13:57.431
I am.

13:57.491 --> 13:57.872
Yes.

13:58.753 --> 14:00.055
You remarked earlier on...

14:00.440 --> 14:03.403
how I go after these chapters.

14:03.483 --> 14:07.226
I really like to go after everything, so I am interested in everything.

14:07.486 --> 14:08.687
Oh, oh, oh, okay.

14:09.128 --> 14:11.710
Then I'll have to give you... We can think about it later.

14:11.730 --> 14:13.511
I don't want to break up the narrative.

14:13.531 --> 14:14.072
All right, very good.

14:14.272 --> 14:19.477
I'll give you a copy of the obituary that I wrote because it contains some very particular information.

14:19.497 --> 14:22.479
I like the way the narrative is going now, so why don't we keep that?

14:22.740 --> 14:28.945
So, so much for Rosenwald, and then, well, I mean, some...

14:29.397 --> 14:35.286
some anecdotes where we went to see him in Jenkintown a number of times.

14:35.346 --> 14:45.461
And whenever Rosenwald really wanted something, or rather, my father would say, show him a group of miniatures.

14:46.662 --> 14:50.909
And then Rosenwald would say, well, now tell me about them.

14:51.209 --> 14:58.780
And then he would point to one and say, well, could you tell me honestly that this is

14:58.979 --> 15:00.621
absolutely top quality.

15:01.883 --> 15:09.775
And so sometimes her father would say, no, it's not top quality, but for that particular school of painting it's top quality, that sort of thing.

15:10.076 --> 15:17.567
So Roosevelt has absolute confidence in, and rightly so, in my dad's judgment.

15:17.587 --> 15:21.493
And the same thing went for woodcuts or illustrated books.

15:22.165 --> 15:27.895
because he respected my dad's background as a professional art historian.

15:28.055 --> 15:42.440
And this is something that you point out in this lecture that these booksellers brought, was not just the ability to do business, of course, because anybody can do business, but it's the knowledge and the trust that they established.

15:42.500 --> 15:44.764
I mean, here's Rosenwald asking...

15:45.149 --> 15:47.531
Just tell me what it is.

15:47.711 --> 15:54.898
And when he tells you what it is, it's like a physician giving you a diagnosis, isn't it?

15:55.098 --> 15:55.199
Yes.

15:55.259 --> 15:59.863
It was very much a matter of just having absolute faith and confidence.

16:05.909 --> 16:13.536
You don't really see that with many of the, and I don't mean to go off on another tangent, but you see so many people becoming booksellers, you know.

16:13.921 --> 16:20.388
Where is the education and the knowledge that was so apparent with this one that came over?

16:20.408 --> 16:20.849
Yes.

16:20.869 --> 16:22.210
That is an amazing thing.

16:22.550 --> 16:37.887
And of course, since we're now talking about these people, they were also people who were, well, has to realize what

16:39.132 --> 16:48.806
America, by the way, we didn't call it, one never said United States, one always said America, or in our case, America, or in German, America, for us Italians.

16:49.647 --> 17:00.964
And it was, it wasn't a country, it was almost looked upon as paradise, with Roosevelt as God.

17:02.706 --> 17:07.553
And we didn't even realize that there was such a thing as a Republican Party, and

17:07.752 --> 17:09.394
How could you not love Ross?

17:11.176 --> 17:20.447
So when people came here in the 30s or in the late 30s, it was really coming to the Promised Land.

17:21.469 --> 17:30.820
And so you have to, I think, realize this mindset that we had when we came here, even I as a 19-year-old, it was just incredible.

17:30.920 --> 17:33.523
But you also point out, now this is a very affirmative thing,

17:33.790 --> 17:38.837
arrival, but in many cases a lot of people didn't really expect to have, I mean, they were forced to come here.

17:38.857 --> 17:38.937
Yes.

17:38.957 --> 17:40.619
It was also escape, wasn't it?

17:40.639 --> 17:52.115
None came because we wanted to, but once we knew that we had to escape, then America became, of course, the place.

17:52.235 --> 17:53.076
Oh, yeah.

17:53.357 --> 18:02.329
Some people were very German and never really

18:02.613 --> 18:26.427
somehow were able to shed their German-ness, you know, and it was sometimes tragic to see, I knew a number of refugees who came here, but basically they were, they never left, you know, somehow intellectually or emotionally, and for them it was a terrible blow.

18:26.997 --> 18:36.190
But the booksellers all adapted extremely well, also because our profession is, by nature, one that you can carry with you, so to speak.

18:36.210 --> 18:48.888
Of course, to adapt extremely well is one thing, but beyond that, as Roger Stoddard points out, they actually brought about a major change.

18:48.908 --> 18:52.052
I mean, the flow was redirected, rechanneled.

18:52.653 --> 18:55.637
And he said, he made this extraordinary statement, he said,

18:56.478 --> 19:00.823
so much of what you see here, and he said, I understand I'm not talking about Shakespeare, meaning... Yeah, right.

19:01.364 --> 19:03.326
He said, you know, you know what I'm talking about.

19:03.346 --> 19:11.256
He said, but so much of what we have here, you know, in a very evil, not evil, that's not the word you use, but in a bizarre sort of way, we owe to Hitler.

19:11.816 --> 19:12.617
Oh, yeah.

19:12.637 --> 19:16.702
And would you agree with that to some degree?

19:16.722 --> 19:17.003
Yes.

19:17.844 --> 19:18.925
Yes, I certainly would.

19:19.107 --> 19:24.553
Now, that's not saying that there weren't American collectors, as you know much better than I do.

19:24.833 --> 19:28.497
He said institutionally as well, by the way, not just.

19:28.597 --> 19:45.756
And that's important part of my consideration, is that so much of this material was... In this lecture, I tell this joke, you know, what do European women, we don't have, you know, this joke, that this GI who comes home after the war,

19:46.208 --> 19:58.019
his fiancée heard, you know, about all the goings on between the GIs and the girls in Europe, and so she asked him a little suspiciously, she said, tell me, Joe, I hear about all these things that were going on.

19:58.079 --> 20:00.581
What did these European girls have that we don't have?

20:01.582 --> 20:06.266
And he scratched his head for a minute and says, well, nothing really, but they had it over there.

20:06.286 --> 20:12.312
And I tell you this story in the lecture.

20:13.253 --> 20:15.895
Now, applied to books is that

20:16.111 --> 20:21.858
First, the books were over there, but now this group brought them here.

20:22.779 --> 20:28.005
And, of course, when we say brought them there, we're not talking about stock that they had.

20:28.065 --> 20:31.930
We're talking about the context that they had, the markets that they developed over here.

20:31.950 --> 20:32.110
Exactly.

20:32.130 --> 20:33.471
The knowledge of where to get the material.

20:33.491 --> 20:35.454
Of where to get the material, that's right, yeah.

20:35.474 --> 20:41.561
And, you know, if you could talk a little bit about that, I mean, some people might think that, gee, well, how many books could they bring with them?

20:41.681 --> 20:42.782
Well, this is a very naive thought.

20:42.842 --> 20:45.966
Of course, I have to put this in some kind of context.

20:46.452 --> 20:50.177
I'd like to kind of... Not sure I can tell you much about that.

20:50.277 --> 20:57.526
Obviously, you cannot really schlep tons and tons and tons of books.

20:58.066 --> 21:03.133
But how is it that tons and tons and tons of books ultimately did manage to come this way?

21:03.453 --> 21:14.046
That came, I think, because of the connections that these people had

21:14.245 --> 21:29.825
and went back to Europe after the war, and through these connections were able to buy a lot, and also during the war, you know, there was trade going on with Switzerland, for instance.

21:29.905 --> 21:33.970
Now, would I be able to get some of these stories, you think, from some people that are still around?

21:35.192 --> 21:37.995
Probably, but you know, this is a bit of a mystery to me, too.

21:38.175 --> 21:43.442
I think that what happened really was that due to this

21:44.603 --> 21:59.544
European element that came, maybe also librarians became more interested in this kind of continental book.

21:59.564 --> 22:00.245
Institutional, right.

22:00.265 --> 22:01.227
Institutional, right.

22:02.929 --> 22:13.885
And obviously then used these people as their sources of supply, so that even without them actually coming in with tons of books,

22:14.219 --> 22:15.260
They made the arrangements?

22:15.280 --> 22:16.301
They made the arrangements.

22:17.082 --> 22:30.718
In the case of my father, I know he had this firm in Switzerland, and lots of books came to Berkeley and then New York, where he had his office later on, from Switzerland, or from England.

22:30.778 --> 22:40.429
And it seems like I keep mentioning Roger, it's because we spent two hours and he was just giving me his take on this thing, and he says, for instance, like Larry Powell, I guess.

22:40.696 --> 22:50.789
I mean, he built these extraordinary collections down at UCLA, and in many cases through these... Yes, through dealers who settled in Los Angeles, yes.

22:50.849 --> 22:52.391
Is that a true statement?

22:52.411 --> 23:02.405
That I don't know, because I... You know, I didn't live all that much of that story.

23:02.485 --> 23:05.809
I was more or less a...

23:06.076 --> 23:13.823
by an onlooker, or not even that, because I have to tell you that I didn't start my own shop until 1953.

23:13.843 --> 23:17.587
So, the war was well over.

23:17.727 --> 23:35.644
And when I came here, I was busy studying, then I became a GI, I was a GI during the war, and then an apprentice in Switzerland, so it was, I didn't live this story, but I knew

23:35.995 --> 23:36.476
all of them.

23:36.656 --> 23:38.679
I knew all these people, practically all these people.

23:38.699 --> 23:45.909
I knew Saloch and Schatzky and Offenbacher, and you named them, and I practically, all the ones that I mentioned here, I knew.

23:45.949 --> 24:03.893
And I think it is they who sort of, what I call it, consciousness raising, or whatever it is, that they did here, and perhaps also due to the parallel

24:04.953 --> 24:32.732
coming here of so many academics from Europe, Italian and German Jews, who became historians, art historians, teachers in the humanities and in science, that also they brought with them to their universities and through the universities to their librarians

24:33.083 --> 24:36.606
a greater consciousness of the continental book.

24:36.967 --> 24:40.370
So there was a great parallel movement, you know, of intellectuals.

24:41.331 --> 24:48.437
And the people that you mentioned, will you be able to indicate how many of these are alive and that maybe I could talk to?

24:48.497 --> 24:51.680
And I expect to do some traveling for them.

24:51.701 --> 24:56.365
I can tell you... Let me see.

24:56.385 --> 24:56.965
Do you have it?

24:56.985 --> 25:01.009
Do we have it here?

25:01.029 --> 25:01.790
Yeah, let's see.

25:01.850 --> 25:02.871
There are...

25:06.040 --> 25:11.569
Now, there are spouses, to whom you can talk, yes.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.436
For instance, Ilse Burnett.

25:15.716 --> 25:17.619
If you can just say that, we'll pick it up on this table.

25:17.759 --> 25:19.402
Okay, Ilse Burnett would be here.

25:19.442 --> 25:21.285
We're looking at page 17 of the letter.

25:21.485 --> 25:25.091
Yes, up to the list of the gentle invaders.

25:26.334 --> 25:29.078
Marguerite Goldschmidt in New York.

25:36.247 --> 25:45.662
Well, Walter Johnson is an interesting case, and you have it on tape, but I don't think you should say anything about it, but he wants to have nothing to do with the past.

25:45.682 --> 25:48.567
I don't know, you may have heard that or not, but Honey Kraus knows him.

25:48.867 --> 26:01.427
He was a great competitor of Kraus, and had a large business, but he told me that he didn't want to.

26:02.150 --> 26:02.971
Mrs. Goldsmith.

26:03.031 --> 26:04.072
Yeah, Mrs. Goldsmith.

26:04.092 --> 26:12.721
And to my great surprise, also the widow of Otto Ranschburg, who turned 90 in New York.

26:12.821 --> 26:15.224
I just had a long talk with her on the phone.

26:21.230 --> 26:25.795
The son of William Schaub, Frederick Schaub, who has an art gallery in

26:26.163 --> 26:29.068
New York is about my age, but... A lot of them are in New York.

26:29.088 --> 26:30.029
That's kind of... Right.

26:30.290 --> 26:30.730
Oh, I see.

26:31.852 --> 26:37.822
And Kurt Schwartz in... The widow of Kurt Schwartz, Martha, in Los Angeles.

26:38.603 --> 26:44.833
So those are the only people that I could suggest where you could get, you know, first... So it's really kind of dwindling then, isn't it?

26:44.853 --> 26:45.574
Oh, very much so.

26:45.754 --> 26:46.295
Very much so.

26:46.375 --> 26:49.340
And do you think any of this is recorded in oral history anywhere?

26:50.402 --> 26:53.166
Well, what I did when I...

26:53.652 --> 26:59.740
gave this lecture, I sent questionnaires to everyone, and they all answered, most of them.

27:01.262 --> 27:09.633
And then, about five or six years ago, I sent all my source material to a German university.

27:09.653 --> 27:11.095
So, unfortunately, I don't have it.

27:12.096 --> 27:18.124
They are, I think it's the University of Hamburg.

27:18.256 --> 27:21.700
But I can give you the thing.

27:21.720 --> 27:24.905
I have to, the stuff is in the basement at home.

27:25.125 --> 27:31.994
They have some sort of program where they want to collect all the biographies of the art historians and booksellers who left Germany.

27:32.034 --> 27:34.056
That sounds like I should probably go there.

27:34.317 --> 27:35.218
Well, probably.

27:35.598 --> 27:37.040
And all of your material is in English?

27:38.222 --> 27:40.965
My material is all in English.

27:40.985 --> 27:42.948
But I'll give you the precise data.

27:42.988 --> 27:44.410
And then there is... I'll write you on this.

27:44.450 --> 27:45.131
We don't have to do this.

27:45.311 --> 27:46.913
Very good.

27:47.332 --> 27:48.314
We can do that.

27:48.474 --> 28:07.805
And then I was recently interviewed a bit on the same subject, but more personal, I suppose, by someone at the German Booksellers Association.

28:07.845 --> 28:08.746
They sent somebody here.

28:08.786 --> 28:14.335
It's called, I'll then write it out for you, the Börsenverein für den Deutschen Buchhandel.

28:14.753 --> 28:18.121
And they have a section of the antiquarian, no.

28:18.802 --> 28:21.889
And the interview was in German, we were sitting right here.

28:22.070 --> 28:28.324
And my German was just absolutely awful.

28:28.574 --> 28:29.896
Was it kind of an oral history?

28:30.076 --> 28:34.302
Is it kind of— They have an oral history about a lot of the things that were—some of the things that were coming in?

28:34.322 --> 28:34.623
Yes.

28:35.704 --> 28:35.905
Yes.

28:37.407 --> 28:37.547
Mm-hmm.

28:37.567 --> 28:37.667
Okay.

28:37.687 --> 28:51.267
So— And they also wanted to know particularly about the antiquariat Jacques Rosenthal, my grandfather, from Munich, and just exactly what happened in 1935, and who took it over, and—and—and so on and so forth.

28:51.567 --> 28:53.210
Well, what happened in that case, do you know?

28:53.831 --> 28:55.493
Was that— Well, yes.

28:56.435 --> 28:58.117
We were extremely lucky.

28:58.177 --> 29:02.042
Again, I think that's in the Olschke-Rosenthal lecture.

29:02.883 --> 29:06.488
In 1935, the business had to be what they called Aryanized.

29:06.708 --> 29:10.052
It had to become Aryan.

29:12.135 --> 29:25.412
But my grandfather, Jacques, had among his employees, a senior employee, a gentleman by the name of Hans Koch, who made a contract to take over the firm

29:25.696 --> 29:26.597
kept the name.

29:28.319 --> 29:29.841
My father was already in Switzerland.

29:29.961 --> 29:40.494
My grandfather and his wife were living in a hotel retired in Munich, and the contract was that he would take over.

29:41.235 --> 29:43.938
He would become the owner of the shop.

29:45.780 --> 29:51.687
It was a very grand place, you know, and he would

29:51.970 --> 30:16.442
first of all, pay all the expenses for the grandparents, and then he was a very decent person, and he saw it more or less as his duty to keep as many books as possible, because he knew that sooner or later this wasn't going to last, you know, and just sell as, you know, enough to live on.

30:17.671 --> 30:23.760
And then he was drafted into the German army, and walked to Moscow and back, and went through horrible things.

30:24.942 --> 30:28.988
And he was the most unlikely soldier.

30:29.048 --> 30:37.580
He was tall and thin, and he was from Lübeck, a sort of a straight-out-of-Thomas Mann figure, slightly stooped, but tough.

30:39.363 --> 30:45.552
Anyway, and then he was finally in the Ardennes offensive, in the Battle of the Bulge, and I was

30:46.139 --> 30:47.782
a few miles away on the other side.

30:49.324 --> 30:50.486
We didn't know that, of course.

30:51.287 --> 30:55.574
And then he was taken prisoner by the Allies and finally returned.

30:55.714 --> 31:12.501
And under really immense hardship, he was able to save a lot of the stock, which didn't really amount to that much anymore, because my father had been able to send out quite a lot during the 30s.

31:13.443 --> 31:30.682
And then we made a settlement with him and left him the firm and the name, and he sent some books, some of the better books, including a set of medieval manuscripts that then became my catalogue number one in 1953.

31:31.683 --> 31:35.087
And we became and remained good friends, and I'm also a friend of his son.

31:35.827 --> 31:42.775
So it was a very lucky thing that we had a decent person to...

31:42.991 --> 31:50.404
Other booksellers fared flowers and had their books totally simply taken and stolen and sold.

31:51.065 --> 31:59.620
Understanding this, I hope, is the first, this is a first opening conversation, and I'm just learning about the subject.

31:59.780 --> 32:00.882
The next time we talk,

32:01.756 --> 32:05.182
I promise you I will have a very much stronger background.

32:05.202 --> 32:06.244
I have to start someplace.

32:06.524 --> 32:07.305
I'm delighted.

32:07.385 --> 32:12.955
So if I'm asking very naive, underformed questions now, I'm starting just from scratch.

32:13.295 --> 32:19.967
And the beauty of this, from my standpoint, the beauty of this subject is it really hasn't been written up in any kind of a book yet, has it?

32:19.987 --> 32:20.187
Right.

32:20.588 --> 32:22.551
No, there have been articles.

32:22.692 --> 32:28.361
Are you familiar with any of the articles that exist for you on the one side that you've done?

32:28.422 --> 32:34.432
I'm only familiar with where there were occasional articles in the German equivalent.

32:34.512 --> 32:36.035
Do you read German, by the way?

32:36.936 --> 32:38.339
Unfortunately not.

32:38.359 --> 32:42.546
There was one article, for instance, an interview with this fellow Hans Koch.

32:42.982 --> 33:10.761
in in the what is essentially the german equivalent of the ab bookman's weekly it's but it's a bit on a higher level yeah so um i'm sorry to say i dropped my subscription but anyway i might do the same it just doesn't yeah and i just don't use that yeah well they have this joel silver who can he writes very well from here i like you other than that it's uh joel is using my book in his course so i'm oh really it's a

33:11.129 --> 33:12.170
Well, I'm not surprised.

33:12.190 --> 33:18.497
Your book will be, you know, I'm going to use your book as a reference book for provenance.

33:18.597 --> 33:23.243
When I see Haber, Haber, take your book and look him up, you know.

33:23.343 --> 33:24.864
Thank you.

33:24.884 --> 33:31.832
So, or Brindley, when you, you know, you keep forgetting the dates and the circumstances.

33:31.872 --> 33:35.196
No, but if I start complimenting you on your book,

33:35.480 --> 33:37.463
I'm going to feel the tape, you know, so.

33:37.503 --> 33:39.427
Right.

33:39.447 --> 33:44.715
But what I want you to be sure of is that the next one, I hope to be a companion to this.

33:45.777 --> 33:53.350
And this is, to me, after the first chapter, which is my continuum chapter, this is really, this is a showcase chapter.

33:53.550 --> 33:54.792
It may be several chapters.

33:54.892 --> 33:55.694
I really don't know.

33:55.734 --> 33:58.078
It all depends on how much information I'm able to gather.

33:58.098 --> 33:58.298
Right.

33:58.463 --> 34:04.088
But it's a wonderful untold story, and I don't know if you're familiar with the book that was published last year, The Rape of Europa.

34:05.430 --> 34:08.573
This is not the same thing, but it's kind of in that vein.

34:08.613 --> 34:12.116
It's a cultural consequence of World War II.

34:12.176 --> 34:12.396
Yes.

34:12.576 --> 34:13.277
And it doesn't end.

34:13.617 --> 34:14.278
It doesn't end.

34:15.619 --> 34:15.699
Yes.

34:17.441 --> 34:27.070
Now, you probably know American history far better than I do, but it seems to me that the...

34:27.370 --> 34:32.862
There have only been two waves of intellectual immigration into this country.

34:32.982 --> 34:33.924
One was in 1948.

34:34.005 --> 34:34.606
I love that.

34:34.706 --> 34:38.815
Yeah, that's a wonderful... It was the 1848, you know, Carl Schwarz and people like that.

34:38.835 --> 34:43.606
And then these people, the others were, you know, the poor and the miserable ones.

34:43.686 --> 34:46.071
And as I point out in my lecture, you know,

34:46.608 --> 34:50.131
These people didn't come, and they didn't come steerage class.

34:52.914 --> 34:54.936
And then, of course, all the academics came here.

34:54.956 --> 34:58.199
Well, I mean, think of Einstein, people like that.

34:58.439 --> 35:00.361
You start with Einstein, I guess.

35:00.421 --> 35:02.703
Those are the luminaries.

35:02.824 --> 35:04.585
But I knew quite a few of them.

35:04.605 --> 35:08.669
I also knew there were a number of Italian Jewish refugees here at the university.

35:08.809 --> 35:14.775
One of the physicists, Emilio Segre, who was one of the chief people of Los Alamos,

35:15.025 --> 35:21.453
afterwards, felt terrible about it, but there were quite a few Italians here also.

35:21.653 --> 35:26.820
I'm thinking of this now as you're talking, and I'm thinking in terms of how I see this.

35:26.980 --> 35:31.165
We just place this within the context of this intellectual way, and it works.

35:31.385 --> 35:32.386
Yes, it does.

35:32.607 --> 35:35.771
It has a parallel, yeah.

35:35.971 --> 35:41.758
It's really this infusion of... This country is so much richer for...

35:42.093 --> 35:48.844
Yes, there is literature about that, but I don't know exactly where the... I mean, there is... And I can find that.

35:48.864 --> 35:49.865
Yeah, I'm sure you can.

35:49.885 --> 35:52.990
This is what I'm focusing on.

35:53.050 --> 35:54.533
Pardon me for jumping all around the block.

35:54.553 --> 35:55.514
No, I mean, that's fine.

35:56.075 --> 36:03.587
I transcribe my own tapes, and when I go through this, and then I'll read it and underline it, and then I'll put together a really good, strong list.

36:03.607 --> 36:07.493
And then the next time we talk, I'll be able to focus in on a few... Fine.

36:07.827 --> 36:11.912
I only hope that I can contribute something.

36:12.073 --> 36:13.775
Tell me what your time constraints are, by the way.

36:13.795 --> 36:13.975
None.

36:14.276 --> 36:15.197
I'm open for you.

36:15.297 --> 36:17.400
I have an appointment at about quarter to one.

36:17.620 --> 36:20.564
Okay, well, I was thinking about two hours.

36:20.584 --> 36:21.745
Two hours, that's fine, yeah.

36:21.906 --> 36:27.473
Actually, even an hour, people tend to get tired, but if I can squeeze, if I can get two out of this, I'd be thrilled.

36:28.027 --> 36:31.373
I certainly have that time if you can think of enough to talk about it.

36:31.413 --> 36:36.963
And give me a chance to absorb this stuff and to look at it and to establish the rapport.

36:36.983 --> 36:40.309
Now I can call you on the phone and we know what we look like.

36:40.409 --> 36:45.799
And I'm sorry I broke up your train of thought there.

36:46.015 --> 36:49.199
Such as it was, yeah.

36:49.219 --> 36:50.781
I think it's going to be a wonderful story.

36:51.242 --> 36:55.468
And most of these people you see are in New York, a few in Los Angeles.

36:55.488 --> 36:55.688
Yes.

36:55.888 --> 37:01.095
And you point out in the lecture also that they all didn't come here, some went up to Toronto, a few... Yes.

37:02.077 --> 37:02.337
Yes.

37:02.978 --> 37:10.007
Now, there is a book about this remarkable man who went to Canada, and I'll pull it out for you.

37:10.989 --> 37:13.592
Um... Um...

37:16.323 --> 37:19.226
Let me pull it out right away before we forget.

37:19.246 --> 37:23.011
Then I can write it down.

37:23.151 --> 37:26.475
His name was Bernard Amtman.

37:28.137 --> 37:29.758
I'll just write it down.

37:29.778 --> 37:35.044
Let me just keep on talking about Bernard, A-M-T.

37:35.145 --> 37:40.110
And I knew him quite well.

37:42.573 --> 37:46.077
He was a one-man tornado.

37:48.436 --> 37:50.018
came to Canada after the war.

37:50.038 --> 37:51.259
I mean, I think it's all in here.

37:52.761 --> 37:56.785
I think he was in the coffee business in Austria or something.

37:57.906 --> 38:04.213
He had absolutely no background, and started in Montreal, I believe.

38:04.493 --> 38:05.254
Yeah, Montreal.

38:07.316 --> 38:12.782
Well, I'm just writing out of the bibliographical information here, and I'll be able to get this at Harvard, I'm sure.

38:12.822 --> 38:15.124
I'm sure they have it, yeah.

38:15.144 --> 38:16.025
They have everything.

38:16.045 --> 38:17.987
And if you want,

38:18.760 --> 38:25.430
personal anecdotes about Bernard Ampman, including some unfavorable ones, which I think you should.

38:25.450 --> 38:27.353
You know, we're not all such wonderful people.

38:27.454 --> 38:29.657
I mean, there were some nasty ones, too.

38:34.324 --> 38:35.166
So this is a memoir.

38:35.586 --> 38:36.908
Beg your pardon?

38:36.928 --> 38:37.329
Oh, go ahead.

38:37.389 --> 38:38.291
I'm sorry.

38:38.311 --> 38:39.653
Yeah.

38:39.673 --> 38:46.303
And Ampman sort of really internationalized, revolutionized the

38:46.655 --> 38:57.551
Canadian antiquarian book business, also made himself quite unpopular with some librarians, because he thought all librarians were a bunch of asses and didn't know a good book when they saw it.

38:59.093 --> 39:14.856
And if you want information about Ampmann, personal information, you should ask Richard Landon, just as I pronounce it, Landon, Richard Landon, who is the...

39:15.646 --> 39:27.940
A curator of rare books at the Fisher Library, S-H-E-R, at the University of Toronto.

39:31.424 --> 39:31.524
Okay.

39:31.544 --> 39:35.949
And still, obviously, there's a lot of information on him here in this, in this... There's a lot of it.

39:35.969 --> 39:41.215
I mean, in this, there's an archive here, the original in the Bernard Antemont Papers Literary Manuscripts Collection.

39:41.482 --> 39:43.224
The International Library of Canada.

39:43.244 --> 39:46.087
Oh, the International Library, that's somewhere else, right.

39:46.567 --> 39:59.622
But personal anecdotes, I think Richard is quite a ... I think Richard sort of didn't particularly like him, but has some good stories to tell about him.

40:00.623 --> 40:05.548
And others went to Brazil.

40:06.524 --> 40:34.337
I cannot tell you much about their story, but I know that there was an antiquarian book business in Brazil that was started by an Austrian, a fairly wealthy Austrian fellow whose name now I can find, but at the moment I don't think of it.

40:34.587 --> 40:49.486
A cousin of mine went to Argentina and started an antiquarian book business in Argentina, which was quite successful in Buenos Aires, and one of his major clients was Borges.

40:51.228 --> 40:52.149
Who was a librarian.

40:53.010 --> 40:54.151
Borges was a librarian.

40:54.171 --> 40:55.733
That's right, that's right.

40:55.753 --> 41:03.463
And the way my cousin, his name was Paul Kynes, I think I mentioned him in my, like,

41:03.983 --> 41:06.006
But, of course, then he changed it to Pablo.

41:06.486 --> 41:07.868
That's one thing about our family.

41:10.472 --> 41:23.169
We always made a great effort, and this occurred to me when I was writing this autobiographical sketch, we always made an enormous effort to learn the language of the country that we were in and to adapt.

41:25.152 --> 41:28.356
Jews have had to always do that.

41:28.937 --> 41:29.518
Exactly.

41:29.633 --> 41:30.134
Exactly.

41:30.534 --> 41:31.996
Right, yeah.

41:32.056 --> 41:38.565
That's one of the reasons Yiddish is dying, because people, they have had to adopt a new language and where they've gone.

41:38.585 --> 41:47.037
And the next generation, that's what Alan Lansky says in my book, you know, one of the reasons Yiddish is in such... Yeah, yeah.

41:47.057 --> 41:52.224
I don't know if that's related to what you're saying, but it's essential to learn the language of every place that you go.

41:52.264 --> 41:52.885
Yes, it is.

41:53.606 --> 41:55.048
Well, funny to hear about Yiddish.

41:56.070 --> 41:57.852
I have a...

41:59.080 --> 42:14.881
nephew in Israel, part of my family, or my sister moved to Israel, and her grandchildren, who are now in the 20s, one of them was here recently, and I said, oh, by the way, do you speak Yiddish?

42:15.322 --> 42:17.024
He looked at me and said, Yiddish?

42:17.044 --> 42:18.426
Why should I speak Yiddish?

42:18.706 --> 42:19.467
Of course not.

42:19.928 --> 42:21.530
What kind of a silly question is this?

42:21.810 --> 42:22.892
This is an Israeli.

42:22.912 --> 42:24.874
Did you read my section on Lansky yet?

42:24.895 --> 42:25.776
Not yet, no.

42:25.796 --> 42:28.519
That's one of the best parts of the whole book.

42:28.579 --> 42:29.020
I love it.

42:29.168 --> 42:29.629
All right.

42:30.170 --> 42:32.734
He's a collector who's collecting books to save a language.

42:33.535 --> 42:34.036
Oh, yes.

42:34.056 --> 42:35.458
The National Jewish Book Center.

42:35.538 --> 42:36.240
I see.

42:36.560 --> 42:38.463
And that's in a chapter called Destiny.

42:38.904 --> 42:39.425
I see.

42:39.445 --> 42:39.805
Okay.

42:39.885 --> 42:40.306
You'll love it.

42:40.446 --> 42:42.750
If you haven't got to there yet... No, I haven't yet.

42:42.790 --> 42:44.854
No, as I said, I'm reading it slowly.

42:45.254 --> 42:47.338
Yesterday, I got through Baskin.

42:47.358 --> 42:52.065
That's why you didn't understand the context of what I brought up about Baskin there.

42:52.085 --> 42:54.990
Well, Baskin, you know, Hosea Baskin was just here.

42:55.342 --> 43:00.388
And I never knew that Dallas Library was as big.

43:01.209 --> 43:02.991
You see, I learned that from your book.

43:03.011 --> 43:09.699
I didn't even scratch the surface of the subject.

43:09.819 --> 43:13.343
You're talking about language, having to learn the language.

43:13.363 --> 43:24.015
Yes, having to learn the language, and then we adapted not only the language, but we also learned that you, you know, you adopt the mores of the country, and you try to

43:24.232 --> 43:25.675
Blamed in, that sort of thing.

43:26.096 --> 43:26.977
Maybe a little too much.

43:29.001 --> 43:34.512
But, anyway, that was taken for granted.

43:34.572 --> 43:43.590
When I lived in France, I mean, I, you know, obviously... This lecture, which I have here, and which you gave, and it's ten years ago now, wasn't it amazing?

43:43.908 --> 43:49.038
I've got another copy at home, but I couldn't find it right away, so I bought another one.

43:49.259 --> 43:50.962
And I said, look at you, let it sun.

43:51.022 --> 43:52.605
And I bought this from the Colophon people.

43:52.665 --> 43:57.816
I said, you'd think you would have had this someplace where we're with them.

43:57.916 --> 43:58.758
The Colophon people?

43:58.778 --> 43:59.279
Wait a minute.

43:59.539 --> 44:00.241
Up in New Hampshire.

44:00.261 --> 44:01.724
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

44:01.744 --> 44:02.946
Gosh, imagine.

44:02.993 --> 44:05.276
Because they look like a trade.

44:05.617 --> 44:06.598
Oh, yeah.

44:06.618 --> 44:10.344
I got two of these, and I bought them both from booksewers.

44:10.544 --> 44:13.348
The next time you ask the author, you'll get a free card.

44:13.368 --> 44:13.649
Oh, thank you.

44:13.669 --> 44:17.455
You know, as an author, I prefer to buy another author.

44:17.555 --> 44:19.618
I mean, what can I say?

44:19.778 --> 44:27.850
But anyway, tell me how this came about, this interest in... Okay, I can tell you that exactly.

44:30.995 --> 44:32.477
Terry Bellinger came.

44:33.470 --> 44:40.017
And he said, Barney, you've got to give a lecture to my, to Columbia.

44:41.678 --> 44:46.503
And I said, well, what do you want me to talk about?

44:46.563 --> 44:51.308
And he said, what I intensely dislike is anything you want.

44:51.888 --> 44:53.630
I like people tell me what they want.

44:53.750 --> 44:57.394
Anyway, so, but he was very nice about it.

44:57.414 --> 44:59.376
He says, pick any subject you want.

45:01.027 --> 45:10.060
And so I thought, you know, when you talk to a group like that, and especially I owe you, owe it to Terry to do something special.

45:10.100 --> 45:15.647
And I said, that's what I'm going to do.

45:15.747 --> 45:16.669
And that's what started me?

45:16.689 --> 45:17.770
And that's what started me?

45:17.790 --> 45:18.832
To do the questionnaires as well?

45:18.852 --> 45:19.693
Yes, yes.

45:19.713 --> 45:21.355
So you hadn't done the questionnaires prior to this?

45:21.375 --> 45:21.796
No.

45:21.816 --> 45:24.840
And so I said, well, how do I go about this?

45:26.390 --> 45:33.846
And so first I made a list of all the people that occurred to me, and I circulated that list to these people, and then I said, have I forgotten anybody?

45:34.507 --> 45:36.150
And so a few of them, yes, I had indeed.

45:36.230 --> 45:38.154
A few of them sent me back their suggestions.

45:38.896 --> 45:43.085
Then I made up the questionnaire, and I sent it to everybody, and then I put together the questions.

45:43.486 --> 45:45.710
It's an important piece of scholarship, you know.

45:45.730 --> 45:47.554
I mean, if you hadn't done this at that point...

45:49.002 --> 45:52.708
These names would... Yeah.

45:52.728 --> 45:55.712
It's doubtful that they would have been pulled together in one list.

45:55.732 --> 45:55.933
Right.

45:56.413 --> 45:56.553
Yeah.

45:56.594 --> 46:05.627
Well, there was one review, Dan Traister wrote a very nice review of it, and he said, this is terrible, because this cries out for more, you know.

46:05.647 --> 46:06.248
Here I am.

46:06.489 --> 46:06.949
Here I am.

46:07.630 --> 46:10.535
Here I am.

46:10.555 --> 46:13.179
Well, I think that, for instance, you know Honey Krauss.

46:13.219 --> 46:14.961
She told me that she met you.

46:14.981 --> 46:15.542
I just saw her.

46:16.664 --> 46:17.305
And...

46:18.854 --> 46:22.321
They must have a wonderful archive.

46:22.341 --> 46:24.285
I think Marianne is very nice.

46:24.365 --> 46:24.926
Oh, yes.

46:25.187 --> 46:36.390
I was terrified when Honey phoned me after Krauss died and asked me to speak, be one of the speakers at the memorial service.

46:36.961 --> 46:39.043
Because, you know how people think about Krauss.

46:39.063 --> 46:41.526
I mean, we have some people that think about him.

46:41.546 --> 46:43.408
Some people call him Krauss the Louse.

46:43.428 --> 46:50.655
But, yeah, but he, whatever you want to say about him, and as I say, we're not necessarily nice people, but he was remarkable.

46:50.715 --> 47:05.550
And so, I said that, and he, well, I think he, yes, he liked me, but what he couldn't understand is why I hadn't grown rich

47:05.986 --> 47:08.728
And I think so.

47:08.748 --> 47:13.653
So he had a slight, I won't say contempt, but... Arrogance, perhaps?

47:13.713 --> 47:15.254
Yes, well, that he was.

47:15.274 --> 47:19.478
So I told Honey, you know, you can't say no to her.

47:19.698 --> 47:22.140
I've known him, I've known him forever.

47:22.661 --> 47:25.083
And he was also close to my dad.

47:25.103 --> 47:29.547
In fact, he sold his first book to my dad, as he says in his book, when he was in London.

47:30.447 --> 47:34.491
And so I said, well, I'll do it on one condition.

47:35.602 --> 47:37.508
that you don't ask me to be solemn.

47:38.351 --> 47:40.077
And she said, oh, that's wonderful.

47:40.117 --> 47:41.883
We don't want solemnity and all that.

47:41.963 --> 47:43.288
So I was kind of funny.

47:43.348 --> 47:48.244
I told stories, including one when he sort of gave me to understand that

47:48.882 --> 47:52.545
I never really made it, you know.

47:52.585 --> 47:58.490
Were your remarks published in that book?

47:58.550 --> 47:59.651
Yes.

47:59.731 --> 48:07.778
I told it down a little bit, because he talked in my talk, he said, now I know why you never got very far.

48:08.679 --> 48:18.467
But what he actually said, he said it to me in Germany, he said, in his Viennese, he said, because he loved to talk Viennese, and he said,

48:18.835 --> 48:21.118
Now I know why you never really made it.

48:22.259 --> 48:25.082
How would you say that?

48:25.222 --> 48:31.630
Now I know why you brought it to nothing.

48:33.091 --> 48:39.439
But that's interesting, though, because... But to him, you know, if he didn't make money... I'm saying, but it is.

48:40.100 --> 48:42.382
He just didn't come here to get away.

48:42.542 --> 48:46.547
He came here to emerge triumphant, didn't he?

48:46.747 --> 48:47.888
Yes, yes, indeed.

48:48.008 --> 48:50.271
It wasn't just escape is irrelevant.

48:50.351 --> 48:51.672
It's just, hey, I got to leave here.

48:51.893 --> 48:52.053
Yes.

48:52.073 --> 48:52.653
I'm going to go there.

48:52.934 --> 48:54.956
And when I get there, I'm going to be very good.

48:55.336 --> 48:55.437
Yeah.

48:55.457 --> 48:57.339
I think this is really wonderful.

48:57.399 --> 48:58.280
It is.

48:58.520 --> 48:58.780
It is.

48:59.161 --> 49:00.702
Well, it's admirable in some respects.

49:00.722 --> 49:01.363
Of course.

49:01.423 --> 49:05.187
Some people say that, well, you know, you marry a rich wife, it's easy.

49:05.347 --> 49:07.169
That's not true.

49:07.830 --> 49:08.471
It helps.

49:08.491 --> 49:14.317
But as a friend of mine remarked about Krauss, he says, OK, he married a rich wife in the beginning.

49:14.998 --> 49:15.859
If he hadn't,

49:16.210 --> 49:19.414
he would have gotten just as far, but it would have taken him a little longer.

49:19.454 --> 49:21.616
So, and this is absolutely true.

49:22.858 --> 49:34.972
And my great thing that always was something that I had to contend with was that I never had enough money.

49:35.553 --> 49:43.062
When I started, I started, you know, people thought that with the name Rosenthal, that means you know a lot about books and you have a lot of money.

49:43.801 --> 49:44.982
And neither was the case.

49:45.002 --> 49:46.544
It's time to make a lot of money as a bookseller.

49:46.564 --> 49:47.505
Neither was the case.

49:47.765 --> 49:52.910
So, well, in grandfather's time, you could.

49:53.691 --> 49:59.097
And even now, if you... I love how you keep pointing at the grandfather.

50:00.198 --> 50:01.379
And that doesn't show up on the tape.

50:01.399 --> 50:02.400
By the way, there is the other one.

50:02.820 --> 50:04.142
The Italian one is over there.

50:07.645 --> 50:13.251
So, when you start a business and you have this horrendous lack of capital, that really...

50:14.227 --> 50:17.272
It kept me back years and years, and to some extent still.

50:18.153 --> 50:33.298
And I had far younger colleagues who made it, quote-unquote, much further than I in a much shorter time because, A, they had brains.

50:33.619 --> 50:34.620
That's understood.

50:34.640 --> 50:35.101
You need that.

50:35.642 --> 50:37.124
And commercial know-how.

50:37.244 --> 50:40.690
But also they had capital, and that helps a great deal.

50:41.007 --> 50:53.324
An example would be, for instance, my friend Larry Whitten, who died much too young, a few years ago, or Kenneth Nabenzahl, I don't know whether that's... These were... and Marr, those booksellers.

50:53.684 --> 50:57.930
And they were that, plus people who had capital.

50:58.210 --> 51:05.079
And that's something I... At what point do you think that the... Actually, let's get back to the... I don't think we finished that story.

51:05.099 --> 51:06.642
You started sending out the questionnaires.

51:06.662 --> 51:06.982
Oh, yes.

51:07.102 --> 51:09.225
And tell me what you asked them on the questionnaires.

51:09.340 --> 51:11.002
In fact, I'm going to turn the tape on the other side.

51:12.284 --> 51:15.890
If that stops, if you see that, stop.

51:16.090 --> 51:16.611
Oh, okay.

51:17.151 --> 51:22.640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but that's why I... Must be kind of funny to listen to these tapes sometimes.

51:23.761 --> 51:29.790
On the German tape, my grammar was so horrendous that I almost asked them to cancel the whole thing.

51:29.830 --> 51:31.072
And they said, no, no.

51:31.913 --> 51:33.656
It's so lively.

51:34.597 --> 51:37.221
Anyway.

51:37.589 --> 51:39.471
Well, I asked him the basic questions.

51:39.631 --> 51:46.918
I don't think that I kept a copy of that, but I will give you an exact address of where these papers are nowadays.

51:46.938 --> 51:50.322
I'll probably, if I can't get—was it a lot of stuff?

51:50.642 --> 51:51.743
Yeah, it was a whole box full.

51:52.084 --> 51:53.705
Oh, that might be worth .

51:53.725 --> 51:55.687
Yeah, including all my correspondents with them.

51:57.369 --> 51:59.911
But that— And that is open to— Oh, yes.

52:00.031 --> 52:00.932
I can go and take a look.

52:00.952 --> 52:01.513
Oh, I'm sure.

52:01.553 --> 52:02.774
None of it's restricted or anything.

52:02.794 --> 52:04.376
No, no, no, no, no, no.

52:04.396 --> 52:04.936
It's restricted.

52:04.956 --> 52:07.579
Well, I would trust your tact.

52:08.116 --> 52:14.543
I'm trying to tell a good, a positive study.

52:14.563 --> 52:35.828
What I can tell you, ask the basic questions, you know, date of birth, blah, blah, and then education, what's your educational background, and that's when I found out that I think, well, 90% had PhDs, including the wives, and then date of arrival, what did you do after you arrive?

52:36.601 --> 52:39.084
And then, when did you go into business?

52:39.825 --> 52:44.051
And a number of catalogues issued, you know, very basic questions.

52:44.111 --> 52:54.225
And I also asked them, one question I asked was, how were you received by your American native colleagues?

52:55.086 --> 52:58.030
Were you cold-shouldered by some of them, you know, professional jealousy?

52:58.130 --> 52:59.272
And none of them were.

52:59.452 --> 53:00.734
Cold-shouldered is what you said.

53:00.954 --> 53:03.958
Cold-shouldered, yeah, is the term I used.

53:04.411 --> 53:08.517
Madeleine Stern said that was maybe a bit... I sort of consulted her a little bit.

53:08.537 --> 53:14.004
She said, well, that may be a bit of a strong term, but I left it in there, and none of them were.

53:14.084 --> 53:19.171
They were all very cordially received and helped by the people here.

53:19.952 --> 53:27.021
So those are the basic questions, and I just told them to write whatever they felt like writing.

53:27.041 --> 53:31.768
Did they furnish any kind of anecdotal stuff?

53:31.788 --> 53:32.629
Anecdotes...

53:34.010 --> 53:36.954
In that sense, I don't think so.

53:38.196 --> 53:47.209
There may be a few anecdotes, but mostly they said, like the Burnettes said, well, we went through the usual dishwashing stage, you know, that sort of thing.

53:48.991 --> 53:52.797
And Zalox told me how they worked for a publisher.

53:52.817 --> 53:55.721
Of course, no, don't forget, this was still the Depression.

53:57.603 --> 54:00.928
And so, but in that...

54:01.651 --> 54:06.336
I don't think I asked for much anecdotal information.

54:06.416 --> 54:10.441
I asked sort of, you know, the basic facts, which then I put together.

54:10.461 --> 54:19.471
After I find out, you know, that maybe they did some of that on their own, and maybe there was some... Yes, that's quite possible.

54:20.212 --> 54:21.093
That's quite possible.

54:21.113 --> 54:23.676
There must be some people now.

54:23.736 --> 54:25.779
For instance, Lucien Goldschmidt.

54:27.501 --> 54:30.244
I will give you... He gave a Malkin lecture.

54:30.444 --> 54:31.005
Oh, he did?

54:31.025 --> 54:31.405
Yes.

54:31.840 --> 54:40.008
However, he talked more about the trade when he came here, came and all that.

54:40.208 --> 54:43.031
It's not very personal, but I'll give you a copy.

54:43.071 --> 54:43.592
I have it here.

54:51.900 --> 54:53.982
So, and they all pretty much responded to you, though.

54:54.002 --> 54:57.646
They all, the response was fabulous.

54:57.706 --> 54:59.208
You got really interested in this.

54:59.248 --> 55:00.649
I mean, to say a lecture.

55:00.832 --> 55:04.657
I mean, you basically went about a major research project, didn't you?

55:04.677 --> 55:06.259
You really undertook it.

55:06.279 --> 55:20.316
Well, yes, and I did it because, as I said, when you speak to—it was—I mean, I respect Terry Bellinger greatly, and I thought that, you know, you owe him that, and also Saul Malkin, whom I knew very well.

55:20.937 --> 55:25.422
I was knowing all his faults and all his—but we—we

55:25.688 --> 55:30.696
I was a subscriber to the AB from 1953 on, I mean, for God's sake.

55:31.617 --> 55:34.181
So for the sake of these two people, I thought I had to do something.

55:35.804 --> 55:38.688
But it didn't take me all that long, you know, three months or so.

55:41.052 --> 55:44.558
Well, I knew all these people, which was a great help.

55:45.279 --> 55:46.581
And they were very enthusiastic.

55:46.621 --> 55:47.342
They all said,

55:48.014 --> 55:51.179
You know, hey, you know, it's high time.

55:51.619 --> 55:52.561
Somebody did something.

55:52.661 --> 55:56.566
So, therefore, the survivors will probably be equally as willing to talk to you.

55:56.586 --> 55:57.908
Oh, yes, I'm sure.

55:58.349 --> 55:58.729
I'm sure.

55:59.350 --> 56:03.577
And how about people in Europe that you'd recommend I talk to?

56:03.597 --> 56:05.159
And it doesn't just have to be booksellers.

56:05.219 --> 56:08.644
Any people that might have been involved that would have good stories to tell?

56:09.044 --> 56:12.570
Somebody said Pierre Brez might be worth talking to for one reason or another.

56:14.272 --> 56:17.076
Yes, but Brez is...

56:17.663 --> 56:29.547
I have a lot of confidence in my ability to get people to talk to me.

56:29.767 --> 56:33.514
Oh, I would think you can write a book about Berets, yes.

56:34.617 --> 56:37.663
But he's involved in this kind of thing in one way or another?

56:37.683 --> 56:38.845
Not very much, really.

56:39.128 --> 56:53.160
There are a lot of... Oh, yes, well, he's involved in the sense that Lucien Goldschmidt, who was the first one to come here for this invasion, was a partner at the time of Pierre Berets, but they split up.

56:53.180 --> 56:56.964
So, other than that, Berets was not involved.

56:57.464 --> 57:02.949
And there are all kinds of stories that people tell about Berets, including very nasty ones.

57:03.129 --> 57:09.034
I don't believe them because there's a lot of jealousy involved, because he is so successful and he is such a...

57:09.503 --> 57:14.890
He's among the three top booksellers in the world, let's face it.

57:14.910 --> 57:16.091
And who would the other two be?

57:19.195 --> 57:20.056
Sorry about that.

57:21.498 --> 57:25.743
Well, I think, I'm talking about individuals now, not firms.

57:32.031 --> 57:35.916
I would say Breslauer, but he's now also

57:36.318 --> 57:48.591
I'm talking now about individuals and who have tremendous, a combination of tremendous connoisseurship and business and so on.

57:48.611 --> 57:56.700
And, well, then perhaps I'm leaving out Quaritch because that's not an individual.

57:56.720 --> 57:57.080
That's a friend.

57:57.701 --> 57:59.283
Mags is a friend, too.

58:00.864 --> 58:01.605
I'll think of somebody.

58:02.026 --> 58:02.706
Okay.

58:02.726 --> 58:04.288
Where does Tentred fit in, always?

58:04.308 --> 58:06.190
Well, Tentred, he...

58:08.448 --> 58:21.490
is a good example of somebody who has access to a large capital, and at the same time has good academic background, good training.

58:22.412 --> 58:34.472
But he, like Sourget in France, they are simply, in my opinion, they're not my kind of booksellers, but they

58:34.992 --> 58:37.556
And I'm not asking you to speak against anybody, by the way.

58:37.576 --> 58:38.859
I'm not against at all.

58:38.899 --> 58:41.403
They're wonderful booksellers, but they simply have a different way of looking.

58:41.423 --> 58:46.952
This is a long tape that... I go over my tape and my quotes with you, by the way, before I use them.

58:47.113 --> 58:50.398
You haven't heard anybody complain about their quotations in my book, have you?

58:51.380 --> 58:53.163
No, because I go over them.

58:53.443 --> 58:55.467
I give you an opportunity to fix it.

58:56.749 --> 58:59.033
I want everybody to be happy with what I do.

58:59.073 --> 59:00.375
So there's nothing...

59:00.777 --> 59:02.258
There's no mystery about what I'm doing.

59:02.278 --> 59:06.042
I'm coming straight ahead, and I want it to be right, and I want you to be happy with it.

59:06.062 --> 59:09.546
So if you say something and say, gee, I wish I hadn't told him that, don't worry about it.

59:09.746 --> 59:11.007
We'll work with him.

59:11.027 --> 59:15.952
No, Tinsert, I have absolutely never had an unpleasant experience with him.

59:15.972 --> 59:18.074
It helps me follow up on things.

59:18.194 --> 59:22.138
I'll be honest, I'm thinking of doing something on him as well, not in this context.

59:22.178 --> 59:27.443
And I think that he is very important when you...

59:27.760 --> 59:31.004
talk about the rebirth of the antiquarian book which is in Germany.

59:31.044 --> 59:33.206
He's one of the great personalities, yes.

59:33.226 --> 59:34.468
You see, we're going with it.

59:34.488 --> 59:35.329
There's a continuum.

59:35.689 --> 59:36.791
Absolutely.

59:36.811 --> 59:39.434
It has to swing back at some point, and it's probably swinging back.

59:39.474 --> 59:50.907
It's swinging back, and... Okay, the tendrum may be very flamboyant, and he may pay high prices for things, but then he is buying a lot of wonderful books.

59:50.987 --> 59:52.749
And he gets involved in his catalog.

59:52.769 --> 59:54.992
Very much so, yes.

59:55.132 --> 59:56.113
And he has...

59:56.583 --> 59:58.725
Good scholarship in his catalogs, believe it or not.

59:58.745 --> 01:00:02.770
I mean, one may be turned off a little bit, but you might think that it's just very showy stuff.

01:00:03.291 --> 01:00:07.395
But first of all, he has very good knowledge himself.

01:00:08.176 --> 01:00:23.113
And he also gets very good specialists to work for him, like Severin Corsten, who is one of the major German experts, I mean, who works with him and for him.

01:00:23.330 --> 01:00:30.472
And then there is a much younger man now, Jörn Günther, in Hamburg.

01:00:30.492 --> 01:00:35.888
Again, a man with a PhD in art history, very knowledgeable, good education.
