00:06.730 --> 00:34.982
One of the real problems was that many of the places mentioned in the book, which I didn't know about, but many of the instructions I was given go here, go there.

00:36.194 --> 00:49.100
I found myself spending a lot of time, in the very hot summer, looking, exploring, actually, on the present world river.

00:50.944 --> 00:53.629
I would find that

00:56.242 --> 01:12.417
would be men driving up to New Hill, and finally this is a train of thought, and that somebody is in the house, they're a couple things, and I would take my thought.

01:13.357 --> 01:23.987
And it frequently took so much of my time to find these locations that I decided that I needed to do it.

01:27.967 --> 01:39.002
The way I worked it out was that if I saw something it was interesting, I made it for it.

01:39.022 --> 01:48.996
And then I found out that if I went into a town and went to the city office, whatever it was, they really knew where things were.

01:49.398 --> 02:09.885
The interesting thing was that a lot of the people I spoke to, when I got to speak to a lot of people, I knew somebody who could speak to the bank of gas, or somebody in the city hall, or people on the streets, and very frequently in some of the towns, and I was, I said, why was it terrible on the streets?

02:09.905 --> 02:19.017
I think it was terrific, and I found out that if you got to talk to them about what you were doing, and told them about the process,

02:19.148 --> 02:28.179
They very frequently knew a lot of the history.

02:28.199 --> 02:41.254
I did get to see a delay when that really disappeared probably within 10 years after I had been here.

02:41.274 --> 02:42.015
I saw the mills.

02:42.756 --> 02:45.339
I saw the .

02:45.359 --> 02:47.822
I worked in housing.

02:50.958 --> 03:00.427
even if they were capital cities.

03:00.447 --> 03:09.956
I experienced, uh, even in the town, it just doesn't have to be.

03:09.976 --> 03:12.819
Somebody from New York is quite extraordinary.

03:13.239 --> 03:19.665
Um, I met, I met faces that I set up on the site, saying, well, I don't want to talk.

03:19.949 --> 03:35.712
And you know Long River is not, there's some things that are a little bit interesting in this, you know, you've got to kind of make your opportunity.

03:35.732 --> 03:44.305
You've got to find those things that are hard enough, hard enough, work well, perhaps.

03:46.508 --> 03:49.112
And that's the way I proceeded.

03:51.235 --> 03:55.039
It really was that I could do the work.

03:55.339 --> 04:00.585
I had to probably call New York and do it once.

04:00.625 --> 04:02.967
And then, you know, just keep it up to the people.

04:02.987 --> 04:12.437
And I had no practical idea of how you did illustrations for a book.

04:12.457 --> 04:16.962
It was just like, say, my book was a sign of the knowledge.

04:17.302 --> 04:19.164
I used to be surprised on the work.

04:19.184 --> 04:20.365
It was a brand new thing.

04:21.037 --> 04:33.780
And I was thinking I shouldn't .

04:36.680 --> 04:41.549
I was quite lonely, and I took an error yesterday.

04:41.769 --> 04:44.875
We think it's quite a good thing.

04:44.895 --> 04:46.618
It's a great idea.

04:46.638 --> 04:51.907
I wasn't married, but I was on the call to New York as well.

04:52.789 --> 04:55.093
And finally, after about 14 days,

04:55.681 --> 05:01.231
And nobody could stop, nobody could continue, nobody could anything, right?

05:01.251 --> 05:10.708
I figured if I was going to deal with my own problems in doing the work, I'm going to not call New York anymore.

05:11.489 --> 05:13.112
I headed back.

05:13.132 --> 05:18.762
And one of the cheapest I had was returning the rent-to-car in Boston.

05:18.782 --> 05:20.625
I kept on circling the Boston.

05:22.158 --> 05:28.145
I don't know what you said.

05:28.165 --> 05:30.187
A lot of stories.

05:30.567 --> 05:31.728
I went 28.

05:31.748 --> 05:33.010
I had no one.

05:33.691 --> 05:35.452
I actually thought there was a little bit left over.

05:35.473 --> 05:50.629
And, um, when I had to go home, and I was going to rush to catch the train, and while the violin line is a first suit to come, you turn the rod, which is a particular rare.

05:52.128 --> 06:03.006
And I got out of the train and came back to New York.

06:03.046 --> 06:09.577
And from that point on, I didn't see what I did.

06:11.280 --> 06:17.190
And then he just kind of designed

06:17.474 --> 06:24.564
Well, I was given the opportunity, however, to find a jacket, and if you can.

06:26.447 --> 06:33.016
And the title changed, and the chief complaint was, William Able.

06:33.036 --> 06:36.201
And my sister, well, what is the problem?

06:36.821 --> 06:42.630
Is it murder after my name?

06:42.770 --> 06:46.435
What they need to do with my name now?

06:49.368 --> 07:09.117
As far as the money was concerned, well, you know, we're talking about .

07:11.241 --> 07:18.852
If we could do whatever we get, just try to be .

07:19.405 --> 07:44.299
We are going to be talking with him.

07:46.439 --> 08:00.257
We were kind of treated differently.

08:00.898 --> 08:06.085
We were a necessary part of the United States.

08:09.777 --> 08:18.794
I know I had this drive.

08:20.517 --> 08:30.115
I just couldn't.

08:30.905 --> 08:33.227
And there they were.

08:34.068 --> 08:44.298
You know, I could look at them all the time.

08:46.480 --> 09:00.574
And not all the other drawings, all the drawings that were used there

09:00.908 --> 09:18.632
And looking at them now, I realize that the stuff that I really thought was not worth it at all.

09:18.652 --> 09:23.078
Can I ask you a question?

09:23.098 --> 09:28.485
I brought a little bit on what is it now?

09:29.107 --> 09:49.191
The other thing that I wanted to say is.

09:49.372 --> 09:51.334
All right.

09:51.871 --> 10:00.967
I wrote well to this because I wasn't an art director, it was easy to do, and I spent all my time inside just for the chance to get our co-op here.

10:00.987 --> 10:09.863
It was a real refreshing experience to create change, and it was really a delightful experience.

10:11.547 --> 10:28.093
Well now, I think in my limited knowledge of the book series, of course, it was an early attempt, I think, to make a search for the book or the illustrator, and to do this kind of batching at the time when we could hear it.

10:28.214 --> 10:36.627
It was always a writer about the river, plus, as we experienced, illustrators who were knowledgeable about the river and the region as well.

10:40.049 --> 10:59.218
I'm not sure, but if you think of it in America, it isn't trying out to be quite as uniform as .

10:59.298 --> 11:01.622
I'd like to echo Harry to the comments.

11:02.603 --> 11:04.386
The experience is certainly unique.

11:04.990 --> 11:06.953
I had a great pleasure at this.

11:06.973 --> 11:21.354
I have to say that I've probably got more accolades and more, let's say, local favorite leads from that project that I've gotten to almost anything else I've done.

11:21.874 --> 11:25.339
I've got a job, I've got a real noteworthy stuff.

11:25.500 --> 11:31.268
Also, I did learn from my fellow artists who were

11:31.720 --> 11:58.200
The interesting thing was that

11:58.417 --> 12:03.007
This was experimental, apparently, all the way through in a different way.

12:03.709 --> 12:07.036
The audience that were selected was rather unique.

12:08.480 --> 12:10.384
It was not true.

12:10.685 --> 12:13.009
It would be a different thing.

12:13.029 --> 12:21.001
We have run into this project people who didn't realize that the books they were writing were the books they were illustrating .

12:21.381 --> 12:24.286
And that, to me, will be 50 years later .

12:24.606 --> 12:33.520
I don't know that that was possibly .

12:33.837 --> 12:50.694
Well, I think that while we're united, we were not .

12:50.734 --> 12:57.060
We were .

12:57.140 --> 13:02.646
.

13:03.284 --> 13:10.333
actually wasn't.

13:10.353 --> 13:14.117
But all of us are much bigger.

13:14.518 --> 13:30.237
You know, a company involved in creating this document about American history.

13:30.807 --> 13:41.421
And it wasn't really until that, three years ago.

13:42.423 --> 13:49.032
But I began to think about .

13:49.773 --> 13:53.878
I didn't know about .

13:54.770 --> 13:56.973
So I guess .

13:58.816 --> 14:10.473
Please conclude our session, and also to get the final observations there.

14:10.753 --> 14:19.286
Actually, there are no final observations.

14:19.306 --> 14:19.326
.

14:19.812 --> 14:45.465
It's been very interesting to me, having been both an illustrator and an author and hearing a sad story about how low the pay was for pictures.

14:45.749 --> 14:52.158
I'm a little aware of the fact that for the authors to pay was very low as well.

14:52.338 --> 15:05.737
If they counted the amount of money per hour that they were paying for these painted scripts, maybe it'd come to about 30 or 40 cents an hour sometimes.

15:05.757 --> 15:06.819
It's pretty amazing.

15:07.720 --> 15:09.242
But that's the publishing business.

15:10.150 --> 15:12.333
and what you're writing.

15:12.353 --> 15:18.440
The Valley of the Dolls is something that's going to be a political or political failure.

15:19.902 --> 15:33.879
Both books, and very well by history, many of them are published on the public service purpose, and I think that was the case with history.

15:34.160 --> 15:39.246
Certainly, it was a very brave story to undertake,

15:39.968 --> 15:48.137
many years of expression, certainly they couldn't have had a very large budget to carry this out.

15:48.277 --> 15:58.889
And I'm sure one of the reasons why it was extended over so many years was because their budget was built and couldn't afford to do some of them before.

16:02.193 --> 16:06.938
In looking at this in an overview,

16:09.061 --> 16:13.945
Certainly, this project is different from any other I've come across.

16:16.688 --> 16:22.153
It was made to match the river.

16:25.836 --> 16:37.667
And in the same way, to find artists who either were from the area where the river was so that they could do or not

16:41.444 --> 16:52.435
I was struck as I ran down the roster of names of the artists.

16:53.837 --> 17:04.768
When the first group they were, usually a publisher had a fairly circumscribed group of people that they called for.

17:05.649 --> 17:09.493
And they're usually professional filmmakers

17:10.300 --> 17:12.843
were known for what they do.

17:12.863 --> 17:16.526
So they're getting very good work.

17:18.008 --> 17:20.310
In this case, they gamble a lot.

17:21.331 --> 17:30.621
I think they would score a appropriate artist with the subject.

17:31.502 --> 17:35.886
But that's the problem with the topic of the artist with the subject.

17:37.030 --> 17:49.281
And they grew upon people who were not necessarily illustrators, but were artists who were referred to as capital pages.

17:51.303 --> 17:58.209
John Stewart, Crowley, and other artists who were fragile and painters.

17:58.229 --> 18:04.995
And their success in doing their assignments, I would like to say this very uneven.

18:05.498 --> 18:14.531
I think that he took this project very casually.

18:14.551 --> 18:22.682
And he certainly didn't present a lot of time and .

18:22.702 --> 18:33.818
It's too bad because I admire his work a lot to be certainly capable of doing an important documentary series of illustrations from the book.

18:36.548 --> 18:41.694
On the other hand, Andrew White, I think, did a top notch job.

18:42.655 --> 18:45.078
He's very serious about it.

18:45.218 --> 18:53.207
It starts when it combines with artistic ability.

18:53.227 --> 19:04.800
In between, there are lots of degrees in my mind of success in demonstrating the book.

19:08.560 --> 19:28.438
Because of the economics of the project, the paper was almost all paper.

19:28.458 --> 19:31.541
And it would not take half a month.

19:31.561 --> 19:35.885
It would take half a month.

19:35.905 --> 19:37.707
So it was used to

19:38.024 --> 19:52.858
working in other mediums, for instance, or oils, whatever.

19:53.199 --> 19:56.607
So there were some .

20:03.455 --> 20:11.964
Some artists have been adapted to that limitation by trying to go ahead and go about before.

20:11.984 --> 20:15.467
And it was a kind of a learning on the job process.

20:18.030 --> 20:24.497
And some of those learning problems on everything didn't work.

20:26.038 --> 20:32.685
But all of them all, I think it impacts from color and

20:33.509 --> 20:45.143
interest to this series because it has to be a variety of color and diversity.

20:45.163 --> 20:51.090
And I think it's appropriate to the subject of the river itself.

20:51.110 --> 20:55.655
So we're doing all the books.

20:57.237 --> 21:00.040
It's a very enjoyable experience.

21:02.939 --> 21:11.809
Please hear that many of them are still going to be in prison.

21:14.252 --> 21:16.634
And I just appreciate these chapters.

21:17.495 --> 21:20.819
I'll put some comments here about this.

21:29.268 --> 21:30.289
Thank you.

21:30.309 --> 21:30.550
Thank you.

21:30.570 --> 21:30.870
Thank you.

21:31.289 --> 21:36.978
The vast majority of the books that are published, they say, don't have any illustrations at home.

21:37.739 --> 21:58.050
And I think the extra effort that was put forward by the publishers and so forth to get more interested in the books, it's a wonderful thing to do.

21:58.170 --> 21:58.731
We are going

22:10.338 --> 22:21.368
As Dr. Billington said this morning in his remarks, Dr. Orson was the creator of the Center for the Book.

22:21.388 --> 22:22.491
And I know he did all kinds of programs.

22:23.230 --> 22:29.321
Now, before we go, one more round of applause for our illustrators.

22:29.341 --> 22:35.733
I had a note today from Raymond Holden, the author of the Merrimack, and I thought he would be pleased to hear what he has to say.

22:35.793 --> 22:42.005
Among other things, the illustrations, both in selection of subjects and in execution, couldn't be better.

22:42.546 --> 22:45.011
I hope you will tell the artist that I think so.

22:45.071 --> 22:45.812
So we did have our

22:46.366 --> 22:49.631
relationship there with the artist and the illustrator.

22:50.092 --> 22:52.836
And Aaron, thank you for sharing this with us.

22:53.577 --> 22:58.485
And with Aaron's permission, I've also made a copy of this letter for sale.

22:58.505 --> 23:00.068
Oh, nice.

23:00.148 --> 23:13.048
I also would like to thank Tace Barnes for a photograph that she, I've got it in another file, I'm afraid, but the photograph that she had

23:13.315 --> 23:35.492
uh of carl carver and here's the author of the niagara braver braver braver braver and we're very happy to have that as well i'd like by now to introduce uh a few words uh daniel horseman who is the librarian of congress american

23:43.370 --> 23:48.855
Well, thanks, John.

23:48.895 --> 24:02.347
As I have the library, I'd like once again to thank all of you for keeping alive a great institution and a greater institution.

24:02.367 --> 24:08.352
The sentiment of the book is more needed than ever today.

24:08.593 --> 24:12.516
And it's vigorous to do, of course,

24:12.884 --> 24:27.985
the leadership of John Cole, who has done so much and has been committed to doing this meeting today, and all of you who are participating in the enterprise of keeping folks alive.

24:29.487 --> 24:32.211
I do want to thank you for coming.

24:33.613 --> 24:38.520
Ruth and I are very pleased that we have a small role in bringing it to dealing with this institution,

24:39.293 --> 24:48.846
When the Star Institute is in the Denver, you know what will come of them, and you can't take credit for what becomes of them.

24:48.886 --> 24:54.274
What do you get to blame now?

24:54.294 --> 24:55.175
Well, we've been asked for a little bit.

24:55.195 --> 24:57.538
I don't even want to.

24:57.558 --> 25:07.512
But, I was to be with a word that I can't get controlled by the Liberty Series that we're celebrating here.

25:07.745 --> 25:13.834
and that is that some books are undeservedly forgotten.

25:13.874 --> 25:16.838
None are undeservedly remembered.

25:16.918 --> 25:32.440
And we are here today for the remembering of books that deserve to be remembered.

25:36.185 --> 25:36.385
Thank you.

25:43.739 --> 25:58.496
I would like now to call on Simon Michael Bessie to say that he would like to say, perhaps from an editorial slant, but perhaps general comment.

26:00.879 --> 26:04.503
John lives very dangerously, as you probably observe.

26:04.523 --> 26:12.593
He says to almost everybody, after he's tried to say what they're going to say, he says, well, you can say whatever they're going to say.

26:12.713 --> 26:13.594
Very brave John.

26:14.283 --> 26:22.855
You've heard from writers and what good storytellers they are.

26:23.576 --> 26:32.749
You've heard from illustrators, artists, and what realists they are.

26:32.969 --> 26:43.564
Now you're going to hear a bit from a publisher, head of his publisher, Chase Barnes, who's been responsible for this series for its last

26:43.814 --> 26:45.296
the process of 10 years.

26:46.397 --> 26:48.680
By the way, I'm a book publisher.

26:48.700 --> 26:50.222
That's why I'm here.

26:50.242 --> 26:56.690
And I also, thanks to Dan Worcester, who is my oldest and closest friend.

26:56.710 --> 27:00.795
I've been called chairman or something like that and sent for the book.

27:01.436 --> 27:11.348
I assure you that there's never been a more honoristic non-owner of chairmanship in the world because Dan's starting here.

27:11.368 --> 27:13.230
And since then, John's done everything.

27:14.003 --> 27:30.246
In the course of introducing, not introducing, but giving way to Bates Barnes, I want to tell you how I learned what the relationship between the writer and the publisher is supposed to be.

27:30.647 --> 27:40.180
I had published a book by a Dutch writer named John de Hartog, whom I had not yet met, and when he sent me a second manuscript,

27:41.476 --> 27:44.720
although that she was by that time writing in English.

27:44.740 --> 27:50.646
I read it with great pleasure and wrote back to her saying I thought it was a wonderful book and I'd be honored to publish.

27:50.686 --> 27:53.069
And I had a couple of thoughts about an editorial.

27:54.650 --> 27:57.513
And I got back almost by returning mail the following letter.

27:58.374 --> 28:06.703
Dear Mark, I'm not sure you understand the relationship between the writer and the publisher, what their roles are.

28:07.845 --> 28:08.605
Paragraphs.

28:08.625 --> 28:10.167
The writer writes.

28:10.906 --> 28:12.128
Period.

28:12.689 --> 28:13.050
Paragraph.

28:13.130 --> 28:19.641
The publisher applauds, publishes, and sells as many copies as you can.

28:19.661 --> 28:20.843
Your loving friend Young.

28:21.344 --> 28:27.114
Okay, I thought you did a great big award in that.

28:27.274 --> 28:30.940
Come tell us a bit about what you did.

28:40.657 --> 28:56.050
Carol, I never thought I would be a candidate to speak again when you called me in 1992 and invited me to tell you what I knew about the Records of America here.

28:58.152 --> 29:10.562
I went through work for Hope Reinhardt in 1966, having spent eight years at Harper as a brother.

29:11.808 --> 29:14.271
which then became popular as well.

29:15.552 --> 29:34.355
And now, we don't know what it is for coming, but similarly, Paul Bryan, Harvey, Winston, when I joined them back in September, years ago, task of managing the editing.

29:35.536 --> 29:38.119
CBS joined them that very same month,

29:38.335 --> 29:46.306
having gotten Mr. Markerson's stock, and they began their first inroads into publishing.

29:46.486 --> 29:56.219
So my job of managing the editor started out with the task of seeing who the editors were.

29:56.419 --> 30:03.128
The editorial director was Arthur Cohen, an extraordinary individual who was an author.

30:03.428 --> 30:12.198
a publisher, and best known in publishing circles at that time as the publisher of Mark Lane.

30:12.218 --> 30:31.900
Now, Mark Lane's right to judgment was the first time that Cole Reinhart had seen anything but Robert Frost and a number of other very important theories,

30:32.217 --> 30:37.262
They were trying to bring a new look to the whole field.

30:38.163 --> 30:46.190
And so day after day, month after month, the cast of characters began to change.

30:46.570 --> 30:57.020
And my job moved from managing the editor to becoming the executive editor and finally senior editor.

30:57.040 --> 31:01.144
And during that time, I was privileged to publish

31:01.613 --> 31:10.642
of the Riddles of America series, to meet Carl Conner, and to know Jean Crawford.

31:11.343 --> 31:23.235
And the fact of the matter is, the wife of the Riddles of America series began with Constance Lindsay Skinner in 1935.

31:23.335 --> 31:27.759
She presented that idea to John Farrell.

31:28.300 --> 31:31.603
And he said, absolutely, my dear.

31:31.870 --> 31:32.811
go with it.

31:33.772 --> 31:40.298
And she was one of the few women, well, the only women in publishing at that time.

31:40.318 --> 31:53.551
And so she conceived a series of 24 titles and unfortunately did not live to see but five women to read public.

31:54.332 --> 31:58.016
It would be interesting to know how many she actually signed.

31:59.597 --> 32:01.219
Carl Karma was

32:01.655 --> 32:06.339
the editor of the series from Fennar, as far as I can tell.

32:06.520 --> 32:09.923
Certainly Fergie Allen was involved.

32:09.943 --> 32:20.993
And always, from 1945, Gene Crawford was the direct link to the publishing house.

32:23.555 --> 32:29.801
The editor, the publisher, you do whatever you need to do.

32:29.821 --> 32:30.582
If you've got

32:31.557 --> 32:44.972
If you've got a writer that takes no direction, that needs no direction, that wants no direction, and has a grip on what he's doing, then he runs with you.

32:44.992 --> 32:50.439
Then there are those that don't deliver again and again and again.

32:50.519 --> 32:56.846
And finally, as in the case with the illustrators, the same thing happens.

32:56.866 --> 33:00.450
Again, this works constantly, this idea.

33:01.291 --> 33:09.180
that the art direction would originate from her or from the art director of the publishing house.

33:09.200 --> 33:14.447
It was a woman at the time of her initial book.

33:15.468 --> 33:20.995
When I was there, Ben Thayer had just retired.

33:21.035 --> 33:29.745
He was doing his own jackets at that point, and we had several art directors, Bob Brady being good.

33:30.012 --> 33:37.140
the last one during my journey.

33:38.061 --> 33:42.967
The publication of the Rivers of America is a miracle.

33:42.987 --> 33:45.830
It is a miracle we are here together.

33:45.850 --> 33:56.863
And it truly transcends all other published experiences, series as far as I know.

33:57.012 --> 34:04.080
How many other volumes of 65 original titles are there?

34:04.881 --> 34:10.528
People have done 10 books in a series or 20 books in a series.

34:10.548 --> 34:16.134
They have bought the rights to books that were already published in other venues.

34:17.756 --> 34:23.543
As far as editing is concerned, I have done a little bit of everything.

34:24.164 --> 34:28.168
sort of writing it myself and illustrating it myself.

34:28.368 --> 34:44.604
I pitched the book to the sales people, and I've been on the road with the authors, and I've tried to apologize for the fact that I couldn't get the head of the department's attention, which will happen as things go on.

34:45.345 --> 34:52.652
But it is an extraordinary experience, and now

34:54.016 --> 34:57.101
I left publishing in 1979.

34:57.321 --> 35:01.828
I find that I have an ongoing institute in history.

35:01.968 --> 35:08.137
I have done some freelance etiquette and organizing books here and there.

35:09.099 --> 35:23.280
In the mid-'80s, I published with the town of Santa Barbara, History of Santa Barbara, which our local organization

35:24.779 --> 35:41.419
had a manuscript written by the local librarian who had been born and raised in a fascinating town that was the first port of New York and a quailing village coming forward in the 1840s.

35:41.860 --> 35:54.415
And so we raised the money and we illustrated the book with photographs and drawings and maps and justice

35:54.631 --> 35:57.354
Sanction of the Library of Congress.

35:57.374 --> 36:00.157
And so publishing is going on.

36:02.040 --> 36:08.427
Finally, to come here today, I called my friends for publishing on Monday.

36:08.788 --> 36:11.951
And the first one was Jack McRae.

36:12.732 --> 36:19.841
He is now editor, director, publisher of, or editor-in-chief of Polish.

36:21.262 --> 36:24.486
I worked with Jack at Harper in the early

36:24.820 --> 36:34.757
And there, the first germ, the first time we ever heard the word ecology appeared.

36:35.999 --> 36:50.423
And we were doing natural history books then, and some history books, and the head of the department now called Ordway P. Have a passion for education and business.

36:51.618 --> 37:10.136
So when I called Jack for the first time in 10 years, he called me right back and he said that he was interested and fascinated to know that a third of the books are still in print.

37:10.296 --> 37:18.604
Muriel was coming today and has been tremendously helpful in providing information about your

37:18.972 --> 37:33.546
got the right information and said that the Audubon Society had talked to him about the possibility of re-issuing or continuing with the series.

37:33.566 --> 37:48.220
He is the possibility for the center because this is his passion, our own way to pass our national history and the history of our country.

37:49.094 --> 37:55.132
And Tom Wallace, who's an agent and one of the trustees that he's doing for Monday School.

37:56.055 --> 38:01.872
So it's been a real...

38:02.459 --> 38:09.617
It's a thrill for me to see all the people I have talked to on the phone and some of you I've met.

38:10.419 --> 38:19.742
And I appreciate your interaction and the opportunity to be here.

38:26.320 --> 38:29.265
Thank you, Dave.

38:29.746 --> 38:41.726
We are going to reconvene in, well, let's say, 10 minutes next door, perhaps, where it's the West Dining Room.

38:41.846 --> 38:48.497
If you stand in here, you went by Dining Room A, so you'll see folks going in and try to get you in.
