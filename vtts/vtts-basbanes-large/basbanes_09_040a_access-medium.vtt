WEBVTT

00:03.170 --> 00:04.633
I said, well, the salient parts.

00:04.653 --> 00:07.159
And I thought, gosh, well, which are the not salient parts?

00:07.179 --> 00:08.461
All right, well, that's interesting.

00:08.481 --> 00:11.267
And that's certainly worth discussing, isn't it?

00:11.287 --> 00:19.044
Yeah, I mean, I understand, and I knew, you know, going into the publication of this book, that there'd be a lot of focus on J.D.

00:20.166 --> 00:21.870
Salinger.

00:21.850 --> 00:30.183
As you surely know as you read this book, it's a book about my whole life and a woman's whole story.

00:30.884 --> 00:39.337
The reason why I had to tell that story is that every piece leads out of every other piece, and there was a big piece missing for a lot of women.

00:39.737 --> 00:48.010
And actually, Salinger plays a surprisingly large role considering the relatively short period that I was with him.

00:48.563 --> 01:00.267
I think because he was such an enormously powerful force in my life that he really passed a very long shadow for a long time.

01:00.287 --> 01:02.151
But actually what I've been observing

01:02.570 --> 01:17.830
among people that I'm starting to hear from, people who come to my website, I have to talk about it is that at least as much as Satan found or actually more, they're interested in, it's not me, it's the story of a woman that's interested in.

01:17.850 --> 01:19.232
You have to acknowledge that.

01:19.252 --> 01:19.873
Hi, good afternoon.

01:19.953 --> 01:20.073
Hi.

01:20.093 --> 01:21.014
Thank you.

01:21.034 --> 01:22.716
How are you doing?

01:22.736 --> 01:24.679
Very well.

01:26.245 --> 01:45.165
But do you think that there would have been...

01:45.365 --> 01:49.552
Oh, of course not.

01:49.913 --> 01:51.335
Of course not.

01:51.796 --> 01:56.784
I mean, I've written other books that were worthy of attention I'm unfamiliar with.

01:57.806 --> 02:06.360
I actually believe that this story would be just as valid, if it were.

02:06.340 --> 02:11.695
if it were the story of an 18-year-old girl with any strong, powerful man.

02:12.096 --> 02:22.003
It intensifies the effect that this is a person

02:21.983 --> 02:24.850
about whom I was forbidden to speak.

02:24.890 --> 02:29.361
But I'm... Forbidden by understanding?

02:29.501 --> 02:29.923
Oh, yes.

02:29.963 --> 02:31.266
He never had to say that.

02:31.286 --> 02:32.850
He never had to say that.

02:32.870 --> 02:34.634
I mean, look, the whole world knows that.

02:34.654 --> 02:37.020
That's certainly why so many people are so up in arms now.

02:37.261 --> 02:37.662
J.D.

02:38.123 --> 02:39.486
Sanger laid down the rules.

02:39.922 --> 02:53.382
you know, 30, 40 years ago about how he was to be treated, and to an astonishing degree, the world has responded, okay, it's sort of unprecedented phenomenon, if you ask me.

02:53.402 --> 02:56.126
To a degree, you don't mind asking?

02:56.146 --> 02:57.248
No, of course not.

02:57.268 --> 02:58.750
He hasn't published anything in how long?

02:59.331 --> 03:02.015
The last published story was 1965.

03:02.055 --> 03:03.337
So that's 33 years.

03:03.457 --> 03:04.499
32 years.

03:04.519 --> 03:05.440
And he was really...

03:05.656 --> 03:29.318
I think if you want to maintain the image of an icon it helps not to be too too available because the more we see of a person the easier it is to cut them down to size and I say that as a person who about whom much has been known and so it's very easy to

03:29.298 --> 03:33.230
to point out my flaws, because I've published thousands of words about them.

03:34.334 --> 03:34.595
J.B.

03:34.695 --> 03:42.379
Slander has published four books, a handful, and four extraordinary books.

03:42.680 --> 03:45.363
You know, the Wizard of Oz knew how it went.

03:45.483 --> 03:50.108
Go behind the curtain if you want to keep your worshippers in line.

03:50.949 --> 04:07.287
And, you know, there's a kind of irony to the situation to me that had he made himself more accessible and available, had he spoken and conveyed

04:08.043 --> 04:13.890
some message himself to the readers to so long to hear from him.

04:14.090 --> 04:30.669
And my own story, well, I believe, you know, just as weirdy, it would be the same piece of writing, but it would no doubt have created a lot less of a stir than it has, because this is the first word on Salinger.

04:30.890 --> 04:35.535
I didn't set out to, it wasn't my place to, and I didn't pretend to say,

04:35.853 --> 04:37.479
I'm the biographer of J.D.

04:37.620 --> 04:37.941
Salinger.

04:37.961 --> 04:47.095
I had a very limited 12 month window of access to this man 25 years ago and that's what I

04:47.885 --> 04:52.411
That's the only thing I can speak of with any authority.

04:52.671 --> 04:55.075
He was midlife at that point.

04:55.095 --> 04:55.615
He was about 52.

04:55.635 --> 05:01.603
I'm older now than he was now, which annoyed me when I read that he was 50.

05:01.743 --> 05:03.085
He was already older than he was.

05:03.626 --> 05:11.016
You know, I'm thinking of my, you know, really, because he was always, to me, this older icon.

05:11.076 --> 05:11.957
But he's 79.

05:11.977 --> 05:12.177
79.

05:12.197 --> 05:15.742
And I suppose that you haven't heard anything back from him.

05:15.762 --> 05:17.284
I think I went to see him last night.

05:17.264 --> 05:20.470
No, and I wouldn't have expected to.

05:20.570 --> 05:25.781
No, I'm very grateful that I had that final meeting.

05:25.801 --> 05:31.893
I think my life would feel very different right now if I hadn't been able to look in the eye.

05:34.618 --> 05:36.421
And I thought a lot about that.

05:36.441 --> 05:38.766
It's interesting that he...

05:39.067 --> 05:40.350
allowed that to happen.

05:40.531 --> 05:42.937
He, you know, I didn't, I wasn't breaking down his hair.

05:42.957 --> 05:44.942
He chose to come to the door.

05:44.962 --> 05:51.077
Um, so when you went there, it was a crapshoot, as far as you could say, whether he would come or whether he would.

05:51.117 --> 05:52.159
I never thought it was a crapshoot.

05:52.179 --> 05:53.503
Well, it's, you know, it's life.

05:53.603 --> 05:53.803
No.

05:54.866 --> 05:55.287
Truthfully,

05:55.958 --> 05:58.562
I knew he could come.

05:58.582 --> 05:59.102
I knew he could come.

05:59.202 --> 06:02.026
But you also think he knew it was you out there?

06:02.046 --> 06:04.710
Well, the way it happened, I knocked at the door.

06:05.071 --> 06:08.495
His wife was in the kitchen.

06:08.535 --> 06:10.598
She said, what do you want?

06:10.618 --> 06:13.302
And I said, I've come to see Jerry.

06:13.362 --> 06:16.827
Would you tell him Joyce Maynard is here?

06:16.947 --> 06:21.894
So she disappeared into the back room that I know well.

06:21.914 --> 06:24.177
And she was gone a long time, 10 minutes.

06:25.490 --> 06:29.296
He had only to stay in the bedroom.

06:29.496 --> 06:31.279
I wasn't going to go stay.

06:31.299 --> 06:35.746
I was going to break down the door.

06:35.867 --> 06:37.509
But I knew he would come.

06:37.529 --> 06:39.913
I wasn't going to make any food.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.616
I came to speak to him.

06:41.676 --> 06:42.978
People get to knock at people's doors.

06:45.682 --> 06:46.423
He knocks at mine.

06:47.325 --> 06:53.134
But I knew he would come because

06:55.831 --> 07:06.567
All these years, Katie Salinger has been able to silence everybody.

07:06.587 --> 07:15.460
There have been other people who have had experiences, some of them have had painful experiences, but not all of them have emerged well.

07:16.840 --> 07:32.368
But as a person who has experienced, as a rather strong person, with no small sense of himself, who has experienced the fear of Salinger's wrath and the emotional power that he can wield,

07:32.939 --> 07:52.078
over certainly over a young person um and when you look at that over a great many sort of you know literary highbrows who still you know bow and kneel at his feet um i i'm quite sure that he felt that if he turned to the door and told me how angry he was and that i must not do this

07:52.058 --> 07:57.433
I would behave appropriately because I always had.

07:57.774 --> 08:00.642
The last time he knew me, I did everything he said.

08:01.444 --> 08:07.080
And I don't know if he's changed, but I sure have.

08:07.060 --> 08:11.326
And I wasn't angry, you know, it wasn't a spirit of vengefulness.

08:11.346 --> 08:19.238
You know, I've heard this quote, of course, and I sort of want to address it because I desire a person to find one angry, vengeful sentence in this book.

08:19.379 --> 08:33.540
I went to, I know every word that I wrote, and I went to great lengths to confine myself to the telling of my story and not to the interpretation or to pass judgment.

08:33.520 --> 08:52.548
If there are, in my story, aspects that people feel indicate a desire on my part to hurt Salinger, then I'd say what hurts Salinger is the truth about Salinger, not the facts about Salinger.

08:52.728 --> 08:56.794
I don't offer any speculation about what's going on in his head.

08:56.814 --> 09:02.262
What I miss in the book, what I hope was there, of course we've known it as part of as a kid,

09:02.242 --> 09:07.965
My daughter older now than you were.

09:08.755 --> 09:16.185
Oh, of course, that's what started me out.

09:16.425 --> 09:24.176
But tell me what you meant.

09:24.256 --> 09:28.882
Well, that was not what my story was.

09:28.983 --> 09:30.785
I didn't come as a literary critic.

09:30.865 --> 09:32.628
I didn't come as a fan.

09:32.648 --> 09:36.092
My experience would have been hugely dishonest with me.

09:36.112 --> 09:36.653
No, I wasn't.

09:37.730 --> 09:43.378
some New Yorker person come to sit around and talk about Tolstoy with him.

09:43.558 --> 09:46.122
That wasn't my story.

09:46.502 --> 09:53.753
And I have to tell you, I don't think he would have written to me if that was who I was.

09:53.773 --> 09:59.781
Part of what the story was is that he wasn't looking for a literary equal and intellectual companion.

09:59.801 --> 10:02.485
That's not who he was looking for.

10:02.605 --> 10:03.366
I think people

10:05.776 --> 10:14.959
You know, I've been sort of well-behaved on this tour, but I'm getting a little angry, to tell you the truth, at other people who basically, as far as I can see,

10:15.243 --> 10:16.945
want this to have been another story.

10:17.605 --> 10:22.009
I wish that the story-wise, that when somebody finally got to be with J.D.

10:22.109 --> 10:30.176
Salinger, he would be this wise, sagely, purer than all the rest of us person.

10:30.417 --> 10:35.782
And they're disappointed that not just that I'm telling this story, but that the story isn't what they wanted to hear.

10:35.822 --> 10:37.943
That there's God.

10:40.145 --> 10:42.988
Well, it strikes me that

10:43.593 --> 10:48.380
that the messenger of the news is being ranked, as opposed to looking at the news.

10:48.480 --> 10:53.387
And if you say, I too, I'd love to hear what Salinger would say about writing.

10:53.468 --> 10:56.111
I'm not angry about the news at all.

10:56.152 --> 11:01.600
I'm just, I guess I just wish that the news, there were more news.

11:02.461 --> 11:03.883
He didn't talk about his writing.

11:03.903 --> 11:06.307
I wouldn't have stayed one day.

11:06.327 --> 11:08.370
And that's not why he wanted to there, quite obviously.

11:09.451 --> 11:13.397
He did, actually, I think you have very interesting things to say, and I think I'll record him.

11:13.715 --> 11:23.757
about his perception of publishing, the relationship between a writer and readers.

11:24.318 --> 11:28.627
Those are all subjects that I heard a lot about and that I remembered very well.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.812
And about the job of a writer.

11:31.062 --> 11:33.504
to tell the truth and to write an authentic story.

11:33.744 --> 11:36.667
Those things we talked about, but we didn't sit around talking about great books.

11:36.967 --> 11:38.609
But do you have a sense of why?

11:39.469 --> 11:43.273
Do you feel that you know why he has withdrawn so eccentricly?

11:43.293 --> 11:49.659
As I said, I don't presume to enter the hub of J.B.

11:49.699 --> 11:51.500
Challenger and interpret him.

11:52.541 --> 11:54.283
That would really be stepping over their mind.

11:54.843 --> 11:55.624
And I wouldn't do that.

11:56.184 --> 11:59.247
But just as a person who heard what he had to say about it,

11:59.800 --> 12:07.632
He had experienced some very sharp criticism, in particular after the publication of his last story.

12:07.692 --> 12:11.939
I don't know if you've read that story, but people didn't love it the way they loved the earlier stuff.

12:13.080 --> 12:16.526
There had been a couple of, in particular, really brutal pieces written about it.

12:17.407 --> 12:19.610
John Updates is one that he was very bitter about.

12:24.057 --> 12:25.960
This is not a man.

12:26.362 --> 12:37.097
You know, I sort of think that one of the things that

12:37.837 --> 12:42.041
about what you do as a writer when you put your work out there.

12:47.386 --> 12:48.427
Thank you.

12:48.447 --> 12:55.653
I don't think writers have any obligation to give interviews, to go on book tours, to have their picture taken.

12:56.054 --> 12:59.797
You know, I happen to do that, but I don't think that goes with the territory and you have to do that.

12:59.857 --> 13:02.459
It may have implications for your success if you don't.

13:03.220 --> 13:05.662
But if you don't want to do that, that's fair enough.

13:05.782 --> 13:07.624
I've done about a thousand years.

13:07.807 --> 13:10.093
And I'm not exaggerating the number.

13:10.113 --> 13:14.123
Maybe a thousand author who could use it in the last 20 years.

13:14.143 --> 13:19.116
And next month is actually the first month.

13:19.417 --> 13:23.423
I've never missed one in 20 years in terms of interest.

13:23.443 --> 13:24.384
Every week I've always done one.

13:24.404 --> 13:25.325
Finally, I'm quick.

13:25.426 --> 13:28.290
I just can't do this in the right books.

13:28.931 --> 13:37.683
But I do think... But my point is, I have always agreed with your premise that if John Updike doesn't want to do an interview, finally I did that.

13:37.703 --> 13:40.748
However... Or Ann Tyler, or Tony... That's great.

13:40.768 --> 13:41.689
Fair enough.

13:41.709 --> 13:48.799
However, if you put a book out there to be published, then one of the things that you need to, that I believe,

13:49.859 --> 13:54.043
you need to accept is that it will receive response.

13:54.784 --> 14:01.951
That the publication of a book involves not just the experience of the writer, but the experience of the reader.

14:01.971 --> 14:15.725
And to shut out the reader and refuse to accept a person's response to your work that isn't what you wanted it to be is an extraordinarily rigid and controlling notion.

14:15.745 --> 14:16.626
And I think

14:16.977 --> 14:18.259
You know, I mean, I know.

14:18.320 --> 14:23.529
Somebody called me a couple weeks ago and said this was the worst book ever published.

14:23.670 --> 14:26.114
You were called on the phone?

14:26.535 --> 14:29.982
Jonathan Yard, Washington Post, called me.

14:30.022 --> 14:35.492
This was in a review?

14:35.725 --> 14:56.552
a piece about this book this book has been reviewed before it's even written you know um just for the the sheer gall that some people suppose up to death and writing it off and presuming to um to tell my story you know it does come out coincidentally

14:57.224 --> 15:02.692
at the same time that Paul Perreault's book is out on the U.S.

15:02.712 --> 15:03.073
Nightfall.

15:03.093 --> 15:06.017
And, you know, Paul... I haven't read that before.

15:06.057 --> 15:23.262
He can cite, you know, and it's really kind of funny to me because the thing that he says, persuading him to do this book, is when he picked up a catalog and saw the two books that he had inscribed, he sent him out, Paul being offered for sale by a red book.

15:23.443 --> 15:25.746
It's funny, because I wrote a book about video mania.

15:26.232 --> 15:28.755
I mean, that kind of thing.

15:29.336 --> 15:35.344
And then we encountered him on the street in London, and finally that was it.

15:35.424 --> 15:37.446
Paul said, just take him to a chin and move on.

15:37.466 --> 15:38.528
That was what he said.

15:38.548 --> 15:42.573
Paul determined at that moment, so he says, to write the book.

15:43.454 --> 15:47.139
Do you have such an epiphanous moment, I guess?

15:47.239 --> 15:53.787
At what point did you decide it was time to write about your Salinger experience?

15:55.189 --> 15:56.070
Well, I don't.

15:56.506 --> 16:05.496
I don't regard mine as, it's similar to Paul DeRuze, but I have one.

16:05.536 --> 16:13.084
Mine was the experience of seeing my daughter turn the age that I was when I got that first daughter from J.D.

16:13.645 --> 16:13.745
Sand.

16:13.765 --> 16:23.796
Revisiting this experience that I had tried so hard to put away and not deal with.

16:24.434 --> 16:31.325
out of this sense of, I now think, misplaced obligation.

16:31.485 --> 16:40.579
I tried very hard to be a good girl for a lot of years.

16:40.619 --> 16:52.618
The one who would preserve and protect him at the expense of myself in many ways.

16:53.358 --> 17:20.563
And when Audrey was turned, when I could suddenly look at my daughter, you know, about whom I'm a lot quicker to feel protectively than I may about my own self, I asked myself, well, my God, here have I been experiencing extreme long-term

17:21.134 --> 17:38.118
of a relationship with a man who I'm protecting and he never... I'm continuing to sort of honor his wishes for me and he protected me never.

17:38.599 --> 17:46.230
Do you think in retrospect you were an interlude for him and not much more?

17:47.948 --> 17:51.113
That sounds a little complicated.

17:52.976 --> 18:00.547
I think, I choose to believe, but I did, I'd like to think, you know, he did think I was a good writer.

18:00.788 --> 18:06.717
He said extraordinary things about my writing, but I'd like to think that he

18:07.085 --> 18:16.278
He recognized a writing voice that interested him.

18:16.298 --> 18:29.336
But it is hard for me to believe now that that would have been sufficient for him to seek me out had my photograph in the New York Times been other than it was.

18:29.356 --> 18:31.860
That's what's amazing, I guess, is that he really

18:32.347 --> 18:33.128
It was suited.

18:33.228 --> 18:38.014
It wasn't an occasional meeting.

18:38.034 --> 18:39.616
I mean, I was very deliberate.

18:39.636 --> 18:41.738
You can make an attempt.

18:42.439 --> 18:43.701
But attempt?

18:43.801 --> 18:47.025
She took steps to contract you, and then she succeeded.

18:47.045 --> 18:58.559
And of course, you know, this is a man who knew very well that he wielded extraordinary power with his parents.

18:58.579 --> 19:02.083
And his words had made generations of young people

19:02.570 --> 19:06.175
and worship him.

19:06.195 --> 19:17.311
So it was a pretty heady experience getting letters from that voice, that Holden Caulfield voice, speaking to me and telling me what a wonderful girl I was.

19:17.331 --> 19:25.202
And I think you indicated that you hadn't read him prior to that, right?

19:25.222 --> 19:25.702
No, no.

19:25.723 --> 19:27.185
Again, you were 18 years old?

19:27.205 --> 19:27.665
Mm-hmm.

19:28.767 --> 19:29.167
I was 18.

19:29.187 --> 19:30.349
He was a virgin.

19:30.633 --> 19:35.899
I had 17, 15-year-old daughters.

19:36.039 --> 19:41.645
If my older daughter would receive a letter like this, I wouldn't.

19:41.965 --> 19:45.049
I can assure you.

19:45.870 --> 19:49.273
Of course.

19:49.413 --> 19:51.355
And you know the story.

19:51.456 --> 19:52.857
If you have teenagers, you know the story.

19:53.217 --> 19:53.738
You don't.

19:54.072 --> 19:58.380
By the time they're that age, you do not control them.

19:58.400 --> 20:03.328
But if you've done your job when they were younger, it may be a moot point.

20:03.348 --> 20:04.470
And that's what my daughter says.

20:04.490 --> 20:13.726
You know, if somebody asks her, you know, what would your mother do if Willip Rock invited you away?

20:13.746 --> 20:15.690
There's no comparable person.

20:15.870 --> 20:16.992
And...

20:17.191 --> 20:21.664
or if you were going away with Philip Rock, and she said, it wouldn't happen.

20:21.684 --> 20:30.289
And I believe that's so, that a fundamental component of this story was the

20:31.062 --> 20:34.005
who I was when I met him, where I came from.

20:34.505 --> 20:43.535
When I was a girl, she had been raised in a very troubled household, a fascinating, exciting, deeply inspiring one.

20:43.555 --> 20:45.316
You don't call it dysfunctional.

20:45.396 --> 20:47.619
I just avoid that word, it's so overused.

20:47.959 --> 20:51.042
And I think it's sort of too easy to use it that way.

20:51.442 --> 20:56.968
And I have been raised to please.

20:58.265 --> 21:15.824
And I was looking desperately for something larger than myself, something outside of me to attach myself to, to make me feel worthy.

21:15.984 --> 21:21.910
I was a person who found a sense of herself in gaining the approval of others.

21:22.362 --> 21:37.529
And my daughter, I believe, is a person who has sufficient sense of herself that she's not going to give herself away to any man to win his love.

21:37.549 --> 21:39.212
Somebody will have to love her the way she is.

21:39.232 --> 21:43.740
They won't succeed in getting her to stick around if they want to change it.

21:43.760 --> 21:45.703
Do you wish that your parents had...

21:46.409 --> 21:56.124
I just find regret pretty futile emotion, sure.

21:57.586 --> 21:59.469
I mean, I could wish for lots of things.

21:59.489 --> 22:00.771
I could wish that my father didn't drink.

22:00.831 --> 22:05.779
I could wish that my mother had been given the job that she so richly deserved.

22:06.360 --> 22:08.704
And then I would be a different person.

22:08.824 --> 22:10.466
And I like the person I am and where I am.

22:10.486 --> 22:11.488
So I don't start in the cuts.

22:11.688 --> 22:12.730
It was very unwise.

22:12.850 --> 22:13.592
It was very unwise.

22:13.712 --> 22:16.096
And I forgive them, you know.

22:16.116 --> 22:18.060
I think this is a book about forgiveness, actually.

22:18.100 --> 22:31.485
I think it's a book about recognizing the possibility that people that you love, people who did not ever set out to hurt you, but hurt you anyway,

22:31.718 --> 22:40.389
and, um, are to be understood and forgiven.

22:40.449 --> 23:01.455
You know, I tell some pretty dark tales of my parents, and I adore my own, and I'm able to tell those stories because ultimately, um, I love them and forgive them, and I think any real life

23:01.672 --> 23:15.338
And then true love comes out of knowledge of the loved person, not from an illusion about who they are and detecting the horrible possibility that somebody might find out who they are.

23:15.458 --> 23:19.005
My parents were brilliant, funny, interesting.

23:19.458 --> 23:35.178
lovable, impossible, unwise, sometimes neglectful, sometimes, you know, over-involved, people who gave me great gifts.

23:36.320 --> 23:38.262
I'd say some of the same things about J.L.

23:38.282 --> 23:48.435
Sanger, although I feel less, you know, I don't feel devotion and affection for him, but I feel compassion, and I don't believe he set out to help me.

23:49.428 --> 23:58.060
I feel that about every character in this book, and I don't think the memoir works if you write out of a different spirit.

23:58.080 --> 24:02.166
If you're still in the I'll get back at him mode, I think that's a lousy book.

24:02.386 --> 24:07.774
You know, maybe some people think that this one is, but I don't think anybody wants to read that.

24:08.655 --> 24:13.782
So, how did the response bring to what you've seen?

24:14.268 --> 24:22.761
It's not news to you that this book has gotten some very rabid criticism, but it's gotten some extraordinary response, too.

24:22.801 --> 24:31.855
My website, which was at about 1,000 hits a day, was up to 40,000 hits a day.

24:32.240 --> 24:42.636
Except when there have been two occasions in all the time of the website that I shut somebody out of the website, not because they were criticizing me, but because they were really being abusive to other people on the website.

24:42.676 --> 24:50.168
But the response, you can see for yourself, it's overwhelmingly supportive, isn't it?

24:50.228 --> 24:51.971
I mean, people are really grateful for this book.

24:52.011 --> 24:54.755
Women in particular are grateful for this book.

24:54.855 --> 24:56.117
And how's the book doing?

24:56.137 --> 24:57.319
It's doing pretty early, though.

24:57.873 --> 25:06.661
I don't even ask anymore because maybe you can appreciate it.

25:06.862 --> 25:07.343
I've learned.

25:07.829 --> 25:11.973
I don't tell you the real numbers anyway.

25:11.993 --> 25:13.114
I don't even ask.

25:13.174 --> 25:14.375
I know they're going back to press.

25:14.456 --> 25:20.702
You know, if it was a number that I didn't like, I wouldn't want to know.

25:20.782 --> 25:22.784
So I just figured, oh, I'll find out soon enough.

25:23.805 --> 25:27.829
I can tell you, I've never had this big turn as a reading as I have.

25:27.849 --> 25:28.810
So what do you read?

25:28.870 --> 25:29.570
I'm just curious.

25:29.591 --> 25:30.311
Do I read out loud?

25:31.813 --> 25:31.913
Yeah.

25:31.933 --> 25:32.233
I read.

25:32.273 --> 25:36.457
What I like press to do always is to answer questions from top people.

25:36.477 --> 25:37.178
So I try to.

25:37.411 --> 25:40.554
I keep the reading portion short enough that I've got lots of room for it.

25:40.574 --> 25:46.440
You know, in many ways, I am as opposite a person in my mode of operating as a writer as you could find, J.D.

25:46.460 --> 25:46.800
Salinger.

25:47.381 --> 25:49.343
I love readers.

25:49.363 --> 25:51.264
I love to connect with readers.

25:51.545 --> 25:56.149
It's why I have a website and why I had a newsletter before that.

25:56.429 --> 25:56.750
J.D.

25:56.770 --> 26:03.216
Salinger warned me in his first letter to me and forever after in our relationship, you know, to...

26:03.584 --> 26:12.643
To seal myself away from the world and to never listen to publishers, readers in particular, that the mail was a dangerous thing that people would set out to exploit me.

26:13.204 --> 26:18.235
Well, if somebody exploited me, it wasn't the readers.

26:18.805 --> 26:29.194
And the letter that probably was more dangerous than any other letter I received was the letter from him, you know, my catcher in the rye, who was writing to rescue me.

26:29.214 --> 26:32.117
And of course, unfortunately, you can't quote that letter.

26:32.157 --> 26:33.038
There is a J.D.

26:33.058 --> 26:34.899
Salinger syndrome out there, you know.

26:34.979 --> 26:36.821
I felt it as recently as this morning.

26:37.261 --> 26:38.002
How so?

26:38.042 --> 26:47.470
Well, the paperback of my Dikey Island's Bible is coming out in spring, and I'm writing a new preface to explain, to bring, it's a non-tipsed book.

26:47.530 --> 26:48.171
About what?

26:48.353 --> 26:50.501
There's a book about bibliomania and stuff.

26:50.521 --> 26:56.845
General Madness is still in friendship very well as a finalist in the national book page in 2005.

26:57.128 --> 27:00.692
And it's been in height for three and a half years.

27:01.432 --> 27:01.973
Oh, wow.

27:01.993 --> 27:02.073
Wow.

27:02.093 --> 27:02.834
That's incredible.

27:02.934 --> 27:04.636
Just you and Midnight in the Garden of Eden.

27:04.696 --> 27:06.518
Well, yeah.

27:06.538 --> 27:08.019
Put a couple zeroes out there.

27:08.039 --> 27:10.582
John Gray, he's the one that hasn't had any.

27:10.702 --> 27:11.183
Yeah.

27:11.203 --> 27:13.045
But it's been very gratifying.

27:13.065 --> 27:13.785
It has been.

27:13.805 --> 27:17.970
Because the first print was like $6,000, which nobody expected to do.

27:17.990 --> 27:18.790
That was the number.

27:18.951 --> 27:20.833
And we're up to $60,000.

27:20.853 --> 27:20.933
Wow.

27:20.953 --> 27:21.333
Great.

27:21.353 --> 27:23.836
Since we're a $35 book, that's pretty good.

27:23.876 --> 27:25.217
There's a lot of money for the book.

27:25.297 --> 27:26.038
Anyway, anyway.

27:26.373 --> 27:30.517
I have to bring things up to date.

27:30.917 --> 27:34.059
I have a fellow.

27:34.800 --> 27:37.442
I wrote a chapter about the book, Pete.

27:37.462 --> 27:41.286
The guy who stole $20 million worth of the world.

27:41.646 --> 27:45.149
So I don't remember that story all over America.

27:45.289 --> 27:48.392
And we corresponded while he was in prison.

27:48.472 --> 27:50.433
I just read about the book, Madness, through 25 centuries.

27:51.374 --> 27:54.016
Yeah, it's a fun day.

27:54.136 --> 27:55.958
Anyway, the guy writes me letters.

27:55.938 --> 28:01.405
letters from prison, and I want to use them because he's been arrested again.

28:01.425 --> 28:04.670
He's now going back to prison, and I want to report this, you know.

28:04.690 --> 28:09.135
And so I'm talking to my editor today, Holt, and he says, Nick, you can't use it.

28:09.155 --> 28:10.417
I said, Nick, I can't use it.

28:10.437 --> 28:12.139
I said, he's in prison for Christ's sake.

28:12.660 --> 28:15.223
And he's got ability, how am I going to?

28:15.243 --> 28:20.190
He says, he still has a right to see you and see Jesus ever since he fell, you think.

28:20.508 --> 28:28.477
Unless you can get a letter from him, give him your permission to use that letter, and he's not talking to anybody these days.

28:28.597 --> 28:30.939
He's just not talking to us as well.

28:31.019 --> 28:32.241
Forget it, I'll just paraphrase it.

28:32.261 --> 28:33.182
Listen, just paraphrase it.

28:33.462 --> 28:40.249
Even paraphrasing, you know, you have to be a little bit careful that the decision, the founder's decision, extends to paraphrasing.

28:40.269 --> 28:43.032
We were tapping to one of the national experts on this case.

28:43.052 --> 28:45.655
Is that right?

28:46.850 --> 28:49.214
embarked on this telling of this tale.

28:50.996 --> 28:54.141
I mean, the first obstacles were the emotional ones, the fear of sound and wrath.

28:55.904 --> 28:58.668
Which is tangible and palpable and absolutely real.

28:58.809 --> 29:06.761
And the fear of the wrath of all the opinion givers who are now passing judgment on me.

29:06.821 --> 29:11.929
And then there was just the challenge, the writer's challenge of

29:12.398 --> 29:18.024
how to tell the story of a seduction by words without being able to quote the words.

29:19.125 --> 29:20.447
That was a new one for me.

29:20.467 --> 29:21.548
I've written a lot of stuff.

29:22.629 --> 29:33.280
And at first, it did seem, I think, partly because I still had this very reverential attitude towards his language.

29:33.300 --> 29:34.021
Not unsounded.

29:34.081 --> 29:36.764
I mean, he's not news to you.

29:36.844 --> 29:38.966
He's an extraordinary writer.

29:38.986 --> 29:39.587
Those letters.

29:39.955 --> 29:44.401
seemed, had been so important in my life.

29:44.421 --> 29:46.744
You know, those pages had meant so much to me.

29:47.285 --> 29:51.370
But I couldn't imagine how I could tell the story without them.

29:53.052 --> 30:06.129
And then, knowing I could not, I had to do a different thing, which was to convey what it felt like to receive them.

30:06.150 --> 30:08.493
And to bring the story back to me.

30:08.633 --> 30:09.574
And...

30:09.875 --> 30:11.356
Not to turn it over to J.D.

30:11.437 --> 30:11.817
Salinger.

30:11.877 --> 30:12.738
It's not J.D.

30:13.078 --> 30:13.659
Salinger's story.

30:13.959 --> 30:14.460
It's my story.

30:14.540 --> 30:23.348
And I'm actually now, you know, a week before this book went to press, it's about law had somehow been repealed, you know, overturned.

30:23.889 --> 30:32.538
And they said to me... There are some phrases that I would have loved to have shared with people, you know, that were just so Salinger-like.

30:32.938 --> 30:36.441
But ultimately, I no longer felt a particular need for them.

30:36.562 --> 30:39.004
And partly that is because I...

30:39.203 --> 30:48.957
I was forced to dig deeper into my own experience in ways that I might not have done if I hadn't had that.

30:49.237 --> 31:03.557
And also because an extraordinary thing happened while I was writing this book that his spoken voice really returned to me.

31:03.824 --> 31:12.034
And when I find myself, I mean I know, you know, people kind of, you know, take this issue with how on earth I could remember conversations.

31:12.054 --> 31:23.629
Fair enough, and I never pretend, and I say very clearly enough that these are not, you know, rebate and a transfer to conversations.

31:23.649 --> 31:28.195
I did not take notes, I did not keep journals, I did not have a little machine like this going.

31:28.360 --> 31:33.949
I never supposed that I would ever write about him, so I wasn't, you know, just sneaking around to write it down.

31:34.289 --> 31:38.096
It wasn't that that has made it possible for me to remember the way I do.

31:38.116 --> 31:43.725
I remember the way I do because it was such a memorable voice.

31:44.105 --> 31:46.769
It was, you know, it was the voice for me.

31:46.789 --> 31:48.031
It was the most important voice.

31:48.512 --> 31:54.081
And it happens that I was, and anybody who's crazy enough to

31:54.618 --> 31:58.894
Excuse me to dig through all my years of writing and we'll kind of see this.

31:58.914 --> 32:00.219
I remember what people say.

32:00.600 --> 32:02.046
I remember what my children have said.

32:02.066 --> 32:05.860
There have been less significant people in the eyes of some readers.

32:06.076 --> 32:10.341
I happen to have an ear for those things.

32:10.361 --> 32:12.403
What people say is very important to me.

32:12.423 --> 32:26.498
The way some people remember, you know, I could ride in your car for a week and not remember what you were driving, but I'll remember what you say if it changed my life, if it hadn't accepted our needs, and his work did.

32:27.119 --> 32:34.767
So, while I don't pretend that this is, you know, word for word what Jerry Sallinger said... Well, if you give us a disclaimer, so I think you can...

32:34.983 --> 32:39.298
I will stand by the authenticity of the voice that I can say.

32:39.359 --> 32:41.607
And the best truth is, you know, if you're a sound, you read her.

32:41.787 --> 32:44.858
If it sounds like him or if it doesn't, it's a hard voice to...

32:45.142 --> 32:48.367
He manufactured.

32:48.387 --> 32:53.094
The only person I've ever known who spoke that way was him.

32:53.195 --> 32:59.825
That first letter from Salinger, what do you suppose you're like?

32:59.845 --> 33:04.733
It feels like another fetal pursuit.

33:04.753 --> 33:08.599
Even if you didn't answer the letter, it didn't go up there.

33:08.619 --> 33:12.685
It would have been impossible not to answer the letter, being who I was at that moment.

33:12.884 --> 33:14.967
And what might my life have been?

33:14.987 --> 33:17.751
Especially on the strength of the premise of the article, too.

33:17.831 --> 33:20.996
I mean, because it did appeal to the premise of the article, didn't it?

33:21.016 --> 33:21.697
His letter to you.

33:22.077 --> 33:40.444
Oh, and, you know, for somebody to tell you, and for somebody so important and so powerful to tell you, you and I are soulmates, that's, you know, that's, that'll go further than, you know, a dozen roses, you know, a diamond necklace.

33:40.424 --> 33:45.792
It's just you and me against the rest of the world.

33:45.813 --> 34:00.456
And that word, lancement, more than anything else, had the effect of pulling me straight to his door.

34:01.658 --> 34:03.380
I get the question.

34:03.440 --> 34:07.647
What you think was... How I would have lived my life?

34:07.762 --> 34:08.863
Do you think you've been a writer?

34:08.883 --> 34:09.604
How many books now?

34:09.624 --> 34:10.045
Five books?

34:10.065 --> 34:10.906
Six books.

34:15.891 --> 34:19.135
Eight if you count children's books.

34:19.155 --> 34:19.656
I do not know.

34:19.676 --> 34:20.557
I'll tell you one thing.

34:20.617 --> 34:21.638
I would have finished college.

34:22.639 --> 34:28.506
And if I have one regret, if I have one regret about the whole thing, it is that.

34:28.526 --> 34:34.113
And not because, you know, somebody I read an article for of the courses was your degree.

34:34.213 --> 34:34.954
Obviously not.

34:35.314 --> 34:36.115
But I...

34:36.500 --> 34:58.569
I forfeited my growing up years, that period of years that's sort of unique to that time when a young person finds out who she is and develops herself and gets to be young and to not have all the answers.

34:58.589 --> 35:03.435
From the moment that I went off with Jared Soundra, I was really never young again.

35:03.652 --> 35:06.355
I mean, it was a year.

35:06.415 --> 35:09.698
You could have gone back to school.

35:09.718 --> 35:11.300
Impossible to conceive of after that year.

35:11.600 --> 35:13.362
Impossible to conceive of.

35:13.382 --> 35:18.788
It was so, you know, I'd like to think if I did my job right, you'd sort of see that reading this book.

35:19.288 --> 35:24.434
You know, it would be like taking somebody from, you know, the mountains of Tibet.

35:25.375 --> 35:26.456
I don't know what you're saying.

35:26.476 --> 35:27.216
Okay, all right.

35:27.337 --> 35:33.163
But the point is, I'm just trying to make you understand.

35:33.183 --> 35:33.523
All right.

35:33.858 --> 35:53.146
By the time he sent me away and told me that he no longer approved of me, I had come to believe that he was the only person on the planet who understood the way life was supposed to be.

35:53.166 --> 35:53.827
I really did.

35:55.088 --> 35:56.931
And I couldn't be with the only person.

35:56.951 --> 35:57.712
So where could I be?

35:57.812 --> 35:58.313
Nowhere.

35:58.495 --> 36:09.507
And a part of, you know, a crucial component to that time that I spent with him was he's telling me all the other people that I must not trust and believe in.

36:09.527 --> 36:23.162
And that included, you know, my parents, publishers, editors, doctors, therapists, young people, old people, writers, not writers, and the human rights.

36:23.182 --> 36:28.047
When you look back at that essay in the New York Times, and you read it,

36:28.415 --> 36:29.156
How often?

36:29.337 --> 36:33.165
I hadn't looked at it for over 20 years until I wrote this book.

36:33.185 --> 36:35.249
How do you feel?

36:35.389 --> 36:36.812
Are you struck by naivete?

36:37.112 --> 36:45.850
So many people have criticized me for that piece, but I'm disinclined to help them out.

36:45.830 --> 36:54.278
But of course, it was a very presumptuous thing to do that I would never now do, you know, to set out to explain my generation, to speak for all young people.

36:54.499 --> 36:56.020
I don't think anybody has anything to do.

36:56.040 --> 37:05.930
And at the same time that I say that, you know, I was young, you know, what was everybody else doing when they were 18?

37:05.950 --> 37:10.875
You know, not necessarily the same things that they do now.

37:11.311 --> 37:20.165
I was trying the best I knew how to do the job that I had been raised to do.

37:20.205 --> 37:30.782
To bring honor and reward to the feet of my parents when they had eluded me.

37:30.802 --> 37:34.888
I set out to

37:35.122 --> 37:44.294
I didn't have a burning ambition to be a writer, actually, but I did have a burning ambition to achieve success wherever I could find it.

37:44.314 --> 37:54.908
And I don't think it was actually some, it was not some sort of, you know, kind of need to see my name in lights for me.

37:54.928 --> 37:57.872
I felt a big responsibility for my friends.

37:58.814 --> 38:00.996
For them to see my name in lights.

38:01.017 --> 38:02.158
For them to...

38:02.662 --> 38:06.767
to have their own lives.

38:06.787 --> 38:14.097
They both deserve so much more than they have felt, and they have put so much into me.

38:14.117 --> 38:21.527
I think that's one of the dangers of having poor undue energy into their children.

38:21.687 --> 38:22.909
I'm a big believer.

38:22.929 --> 38:24.771
You can't love your children too much, and you can't

38:25.021 --> 38:35.681
You can't give them too much sense that they're wonderful and you adore them, but I was raised to achieve.

38:35.701 --> 38:38.346
Have you achieved to your satisfaction?

38:39.087 --> 38:44.177
I have a different standard of achievement.

38:44.731 --> 38:49.589
I'm very comfortable with what I've done with my not yet completed life.

38:50.553 --> 38:55.652
My chief goal was to

38:56.442 --> 39:14.463
was to make a happy family, to be part of a happy family.

39:14.483 --> 39:18.268
And I thought for years, and that's a big part of the story that I tell, that the way to do it was to sort of make everything perfect for everybody.

39:18.288 --> 39:21.051
And I made this picture of a happy family that was very stressful for all concerned.

39:21.071 --> 39:22.753
Me, my children, my children's father.

39:23.088 --> 39:32.558
I'm enormously proud of our children and who they are that's totally on their own.

39:32.791 --> 39:38.760
that they created and the part that I played in shepherding them along.

39:39.240 --> 39:40.843
And I'm proud of the work I've done.

39:40.863 --> 39:45.609
But I'm not looking to win some big prize anymore.

39:45.870 --> 39:55.404
If my definition of success was getting a pat on the back from Jonathan Yardley, I guess I'd be feeling pretty bad right now.

39:55.664 --> 39:56.385
But it's not.

39:56.534 --> 39:59.860
There's a big essay on your, was it in Times recently?

39:59.880 --> 40:02.225
The Simbi Times Magazine, the profile?

40:02.245 --> 40:03.928
I think so.

40:04.649 --> 40:06.834
They were all over.

40:06.854 --> 40:11.943
Your work has been described as a season of a confessional over the years.

40:12.024 --> 40:12.805
Absolutely.

40:13.072 --> 40:38.218
you know breast implants i'll say it sure um my i i actually have written about many other things you know these writers are very selective in what they should say but but i'll freely and rather proudly say that my probably my my most consistent undertaker for um all of my adult life has been maintaining an ongoing story of my life and it's not that i regard my life so much

40:38.198 --> 40:40.561
infinitely more fascinating than everybody else.

40:40.581 --> 40:43.524
It just happens to be the only life that I have that kind of access to.

40:43.544 --> 40:46.167
Do you want me to tell about your life for 25 years?

40:46.187 --> 41:06.450
And why I think it has a value, why I know actually it has a value, I know this, because I am concerned in this every day when I hear back from readers, is because there are a lot of other people out there, women in particular, but sometimes it's men too, but I want to finish this sentence.

41:06.734 --> 41:22.954
who are experiencing similar kinds of situations to the ones that I write about, but who don't feel able to write about them or even talk about them with a friend, and who feel enormous amounts of isolation and shame as a result.

41:23.727 --> 41:41.179
i know how that feels because i grew up that way i grew up believing my father was the only person on the face of the earth who got drunk i truly did i didn't know that anybody else's dad did that and that was more difficult to deal with than just his drunkenness was just the secret keeping and the shame and the

41:41.159 --> 41:45.785
and the sense that I was kind of a freak and that I had to kind of keep this picture.

41:46.206 --> 41:52.274
And so I know it's not hard for me to... What are you doing?

41:52.494 --> 41:54.116
Are you finished now?

41:54.176 --> 41:54.777
Yes, I am.

41:54.877 --> 41:56.299
Did I do that?

41:57.321 --> 41:58.242
No, okay.

41:58.262 --> 42:10.238
It's not difficult for me to understand how it is that I came to write in the self-disclosing way that I did.

42:10.437 --> 42:24.415
I care a lot about a woman out there who, you know, who also sometimes feels enormous, you know, frustration, like a poem with a baby or in a marriage or loneliness or whatever.

42:24.575 --> 42:27.058
And I think I help her by telling my story.

42:27.198 --> 42:34.167
My story sometimes, you know, people will read my story and say, boy, that's not what I would have done, and that's fine too, but I give them

42:34.501 --> 42:38.445
a picture out there.

42:38.525 --> 42:47.293
I'm a little sorry that I have to be, I think I'm a serious writer and I've written a serious book and I'm sorry that the person is going to say 10 things about me.

42:47.553 --> 42:49.996
I don't think rest is going to be the most important.

42:50.316 --> 42:55.321
However, no, I'm not going to pretend this is some unnationable situation.

42:56.542 --> 43:01.707
I felt, once again, it wasn't that I felt, I knew that there were

43:02.092 --> 43:20.890
millions of women out there who, like me, had given birth to babies, nursed babies, stood in front of the mirror, and looked at what had happened to their body, wouldn't for one minute give back their children, but felt deep sorrow and shame.

43:21.151 --> 43:24.214
And also something else that they couldn't talk about.

43:24.234 --> 43:26.216
This was a dirty little secret.

43:27.157 --> 43:30.580
And I decided to talk about it.

43:30.914 --> 43:36.901
It's evidence of how necessary that was, that people seize on it the way they do.

43:36.921 --> 43:38.923
My God, my breasts are like, well, yes.

43:39.244 --> 43:45.131
If there had been any exercise in the world I could have engaged in, I sure would have, but I was always the person I wanted to do.

43:45.151 --> 43:54.762
I decided to do this thing for me that probably every man in the world would be lining up to do if men's bodies were altered by fatherhood as women's often are by motherhood.

43:54.893 --> 43:57.261
And then I did another thing, which is I told about it.

43:57.763 --> 44:05.228
And I got docketed letters from women who said, it was never about getting big breasts, which is what, you know, some male reporter will reduce it to.

44:05.248 --> 44:07.215
It was about saying...

44:07.364 --> 44:10.170
You know, giving women permission for their feelings.

44:10.631 --> 44:13.056
Women have done nothing so terrible, nothing so wrong.

44:13.116 --> 44:15.622
Maybe have a little vanity, wish they kind of looked better.

44:15.702 --> 44:16.844
Where's the shame in that?

44:17.045 --> 44:17.987
God, I'll talk about it.

44:18.508 --> 44:24.380
And if it means that, you know, for the rest of my life I've become George Maynard, the writer with Dresden Frank, so be it.

44:24.581 --> 44:26.605
I can handle it.

44:26.585 --> 44:55.326
i as i said i'm not looking for the approval of you know the great literati up there who decided that that's not a writerly thing to do i want to just finish that thing at the core of how i behave is that i don't believe that there's two successive sort of ways of being on this planet you know how normal people how regular peons behave and then there are the writers you know who who float in and they're you know gilded cage and and you know don't

44:55.964 --> 45:05.916
Sometimes screw up, make mistakes, have problems, send letters to 18-year-old girls, whatever it is, you know, like all the rest of them.

45:05.936 --> 45:11.143
Now, I have a sense from what you're saying that you absolutely perceive your reader, or you have a sense for your readers.

45:11.543 --> 45:13.646
It's men, too, actually.

45:13.706 --> 45:14.387
Men, too.

45:14.407 --> 45:25.701
I mean, some of my most faithful readers are men, but they are people who, the common elements, they're different ages, they're lots of different things, but I've been noticing how many young girls, young women,

45:25.681 --> 45:31.435
and that surprises me because it's a big thing for a 21-year-old to buy a hardback book.

45:31.455 --> 45:44.145
But a common element would be that they have experienced some kind of pain and hard times and feel

45:44.868 --> 45:52.540
grateful that somebody is talking about their story.

45:52.920 --> 46:01.273
Likewise, the people who are probably made most uncomfortable by my work, I will speculate on this.

46:02.452 --> 46:18.175
They're very uncomfortable with opening the locked doors, and I've got to wonder what kind of doors do they have in their life that they don't want to... And that piece does also look at you, regardless of what some of your critics might say, you certainly do have a core of readers, apparently.

46:18.716 --> 46:19.838
Oh, yes.

46:20.138 --> 46:21.420
They're not fans.

46:21.500 --> 46:22.862
They're friends.

46:22.882 --> 46:25.506
It's a very unusual thing, my readers.

46:25.486 --> 46:29.791
Then I tell the story briefly, and I thank a lot of people in the forward of my book.

46:29.871 --> 46:33.816
I do, incidentally, and I'm not some sort of sad sack who lives her life on the internet.

46:33.856 --> 46:38.702
I have flesh and blood, real human friends, and some of them.

46:38.722 --> 46:47.072
But one distinct category of people who are very dear to me are readers, some of whom I've never met, but I've been hearing from them for 15 years.

46:47.221 --> 46:54.250
A lot of them I read this book to out loud at various stages of the writing while I was working on it in a long and rather lonely winter.

46:54.270 --> 46:59.317
I'd call up the phone and speak to some woman in Michigan or some guy in Texas.

46:59.397 --> 47:05.364
But I'd been hearing from him and I knew he's the one that reads my work that sort of gets what I'm doing.

47:05.404 --> 47:10.130
I want to see how this works for him and if I'm getting it across.

47:10.631 --> 47:13.735
One guy, I love this one.

47:14.963 --> 47:20.313
There were actually a couple that were very important to me.

47:20.814 --> 47:30.593
Contrary to what some believe, and I'd actually be happy to talk about this notion that it's somehow offensive to make money off of a book.

47:30.877 --> 47:35.044
I didn't actually make a fortune out of this book, and in fact, I was paid rather moderately.

47:35.064 --> 47:37.668
You'll never find me criticizing this.

47:37.688 --> 47:42.616
I figured if you've been a freelancer, I noticed you hadn't asked that question, and I guess why.

47:42.696 --> 47:44.519
I say as much as you make this final mix.

47:44.539 --> 47:56.378
But in fact, just as a point, I haven't been paid a whole ton of money, and so I ran out of money last fall at just the point where... Well, one less has it.

47:56.915 --> 48:02.304
And it was a disappointment when I finally figured out how, when I finally was ready to write this book after I came back from seeing Jerry Salinger.

48:02.544 --> 48:09.255
And I was prepared to do, the obvious thing to do was what I'd always done and what I'm sure you're very familiar with.

48:09.275 --> 48:11.779
You know, you took on 10 million magazine jobs to support your book.

48:12.460 --> 48:20.273
And I just felt this time for once in my life, I wanted to devote myself absolutely without...

48:21.485 --> 48:38.785
interruption or or distraction to the telling of the story to do the absolute best i possibly could it was too important to do that but i couldn't afford to do that for two children you know they have ongoing lives i could probably live in a hut but it's not enough because they aren't living

48:39.322 --> 48:46.510
And I had a reader who I had never met, but I'd been hearing from him also for about 10 years.

48:46.530 --> 48:52.858
I knew he ran a manufacturing company, forklift company in the Midwest.

48:52.878 --> 49:00.807
And I sent him a note, and I said he had one time sent a contribution to my newsletter when I'd mentioned that I couldn't bring out an issue of my newsletter because I was broke again.

49:01.158 --> 49:08.871
And I said, you know, a business proposal describing the books that I wanted to do and my confidence that I would be able to repay them.

49:08.891 --> 49:14.961
And I offered to turn over to him as collateral against a loan in my Salinger letters.

49:15.361 --> 49:16.924
And I said, you know, I have no idea what they're worth.

49:17.004 --> 49:21.511
I've never really thought about it particularly until recently I hadn't even sort of thought about the letters.

49:21.531 --> 49:25.418
And I said, so we could get them appraised if you'd consider this at all.

49:25.438 --> 49:27.942
And he called me within an hour of getting the letter and he said,

49:28.462 --> 49:30.648
I feel no need to have these letters of praise.

49:30.668 --> 49:31.530
I know it's better not.

49:31.811 --> 49:34.878
You just don't want to bring a lot of attention to yourself about this right now.

49:34.898 --> 49:38.708
Just tell me how much you want and I'll send you a check."

49:38.924 --> 49:42.830
basically supported my family, being alone and supported my family for six months.

49:42.890 --> 49:47.076
I have absolute confidence that I'll pay you that.

49:47.357 --> 49:48.458
But those are my readers.

49:48.478 --> 49:50.161
I mean, they're all different kinds.

49:50.221 --> 49:53.226
Some of them don't have a credit to their name, and this one, you know, luckily did.

49:53.366 --> 49:55.549
And another one met me at his house in Oregon.

49:55.589 --> 49:56.551
He and his wife met us.

49:56.631 --> 49:58.213
Now, you mentioned this in the book, yeah.

49:58.233 --> 49:59.835
I read more from the book, more than the book from the real place.

50:00.136 --> 50:02.900
Oh, no, I knew you, but you just told me to say things even if you knew them.

50:02.920 --> 50:04.002
But that is really good.

50:04.162 --> 50:06.345
And it's not just, obviously, that was not about money.

50:06.365 --> 50:08.188
It was about faith in me.

50:08.725 --> 50:11.049
That's quite remarkable, actually.

50:11.069 --> 50:14.734
I read these things with great interest.

50:15.295 --> 50:18.821
Being a writer without a university appointment, without grants.

50:18.981 --> 50:22.166
It's a very rare thing to be... It's the same thing in the world to do.

50:22.266 --> 50:23.268
I'm going to Europe now.

50:23.468 --> 50:25.711
This is my eighth trip to Europe for this new book.

50:25.811 --> 50:28.055
I mean, this is a very expensive trip.

50:28.135 --> 50:30.599
My advance on this book, long, long.

50:30.639 --> 50:31.580
Oh, of course, I know that.

50:31.600 --> 50:32.502
Long, long.

50:32.702 --> 50:33.904
You have to have great faith in yourself.

50:33.924 --> 50:35.166
It doesn't matter how much money you make.

50:35.186 --> 50:36.127
I mean, everybody's fine.

50:36.148 --> 50:37.129
You know, it's...

50:37.531 --> 50:46.943
So it's, you know, I do this, I write children's book reviews, I write a monthly column for a magazine, and it's called Biblio, isn't it?

50:46.963 --> 50:48.185
Okay, Biblio.

50:48.545 --> 50:51.529
Should we, do you have an expense for that?

50:51.549 --> 50:52.871
Yes, sure, I'll send you funds in my room.

50:53.231 --> 50:53.812
Okay.

50:53.832 --> 50:56.275
Your room, or do you work in our home?

50:56.295 --> 50:57.697
No, I... Oh, okay, I'm okay.

50:58.258 --> 50:59.359
Okay, I'll bring you home in charge.

51:00.861 --> 51:01.682
Otherwise, I'll do that.

51:02.557 --> 51:04.719
especially on the heels of this conversation.

51:07.742 --> 51:17.272
So anyway, you asked about my readers.

51:17.773 --> 51:32.428
Yes, many of them are women, and women who have experienced the kinds of things I have, raising children, trying to be both

51:32.678 --> 51:41.591
You know, to live a career life and be this thing, this good mother, you know, that we all try to be so hard.

51:41.751 --> 51:43.193
She's no one who lives right over here.

51:43.413 --> 51:44.215
What a book with that exact title.

51:44.375 --> 51:45.076
Yes, I know it.

51:45.276 --> 51:49.743
Except it's a great title because it hangs over your head.

51:49.803 --> 51:51.806
She lives about a five-minute book.

51:51.826 --> 51:52.486
Ha, do you know her?

51:53.748 --> 51:56.112
Only because I've interviewed her about four times over the years.

51:56.612 --> 51:57.994
I'm going to ask her to describe her.

51:58.014 --> 51:58.335
Oh, great.

51:58.515 --> 51:59.817
If you don't mind.

52:01.062 --> 52:07.669
I think, you know, I've stayed in so many hotels, I have to think what the number is.

52:07.689 --> 52:09.711
Isn't it funny, let me give you a good pen.

52:09.731 --> 52:10.932
Much better.

52:10.952 --> 52:13.034
Ooh, better practice.

52:13.975 --> 52:16.418
I was signing my book.

52:17.739 --> 52:20.902
Oh, that's beautiful.

52:20.922 --> 52:24.326
Just running off.

52:24.646 --> 52:25.527
Yeah, we're doing fine.

52:25.547 --> 52:29.171
Hey, please date it.

52:29.191 --> 52:29.331
Mm-hmm.

52:29.902 --> 52:31.424
Let's check off what we've got here.

52:31.444 --> 52:31.745
Quotes.

52:33.207 --> 52:40.618
So you have no idea if Salinger's, obviously, if he's working on anything or whether we'll ever... What's your gut feeling?

52:40.638 --> 52:45.926
Do you think we'll ever see anything from Salinger in his lifetime?

52:45.946 --> 52:47.669
I think we'll see letters.

52:47.689 --> 52:48.070
From him?

52:48.190 --> 52:50.674
And not just mine.

52:50.694 --> 52:52.957
In his lifetime?

52:52.977 --> 52:55.421
I mean, there are many letters.

52:56.102 --> 52:56.803
That he has written.

52:58.623 --> 53:02.106
And you think he will authorize the publication of that?

53:02.126 --> 53:03.007
Do you know Ken Rendell?

53:03.487 --> 53:04.508
I know Ken very well.

53:04.968 --> 53:05.849
May I talk to Ken Rendell?

53:11.034 --> 53:15.317
That's very interesting.

53:15.337 --> 53:18.120
You think Salinger would... This is off the record, I'm just curious.

53:18.180 --> 53:18.720
Sell his letters?

53:18.740 --> 53:20.101
Oh, God, no, I don't mean that.

53:20.121 --> 53:24.605
I mean, I'm not the only young girl that ever got letters.

53:24.625 --> 53:27.267
Ken Rendell knows a couple, and I know a few more.

53:27.528 --> 53:27.988
I see.

53:28.812 --> 53:31.877
I guess what I'm saying is, do you think we'll see anything from Salinger?

53:31.897 --> 53:32.438
From Salinger?

53:32.498 --> 53:36.243
Lighting is what I mean.

53:36.264 --> 53:36.424
Oh, God.

53:36.444 --> 53:36.844
That's what I meant.

53:36.864 --> 53:39.909
But that's very interesting.

53:40.129 --> 53:48.122
You know, I think your guess is as good as mine.

53:48.142 --> 53:48.342
Yeah.

53:48.603 --> 53:49.604
And maybe one other question.

53:49.624 --> 53:51.086
I'd like to take a couple of pictures.

53:51.187 --> 53:52.709
We've got a 3.30 thing coming up.

53:53.490 --> 53:55.393
Yeah, we're fine.

53:55.812 --> 54:14.816
Some of these pictures are like some colored pictures.

54:14.836 --> 54:15.236
That's nice, thanks.

54:15.256 --> 54:15.897
Oh, that's very nice, thank you.

54:18.340 --> 54:27.252
And what's your website?

54:27.353 --> 54:35.204
It's JoyceMainard.com.

54:36.265 --> 54:37.607
How long have you had your website?

54:38.208 --> 54:39.950
About 14 months.

54:39.970 --> 54:43.335
Actually, we're reaching our 2 millionth hit tomorrow.

54:43.552 --> 54:52.143
And what are you working on for your next... It'll be a novel that I would never try to... Can you imagine starting a novel on a book tour?

54:52.163 --> 54:53.044
I do this.

54:53.104 --> 54:54.987
The writing that I do on this book tour is the website.

54:55.007 --> 54:57.150
I check into the website several times a day.

54:58.131 --> 55:06.562
You know, if somebody's going to particularly talk with me, it's very heartless to go back and plug in and talk with readers.

55:06.582 --> 55:09.205
So, one last question, please.

55:09.522 --> 55:14.170
So you are sensitive to what people say about the book?

55:14.231 --> 55:14.631
Sensitive to?

55:14.832 --> 55:16.695
I'm interested in.

55:17.016 --> 55:18.598
Will any of them make me cry?

55:18.699 --> 55:19.079
No.

55:20.923 --> 55:21.744
No, no.

55:21.884 --> 55:23.307
Richard Ford.

55:23.547 --> 55:23.908
Really?

55:24.048 --> 55:24.669
Interesting.

55:24.730 --> 55:29.438
In fact, I was writing for a paper down in Tennessee.

55:29.705 --> 55:32.529
And he blew it and said, do you know Frederick Keppel?

55:32.549 --> 55:33.951
And I said, he named him the guy.

55:33.971 --> 55:36.395
He said, he savaged my book 15 years ago.

55:36.716 --> 55:40.181
And he'd never forgiven him.

55:40.221 --> 55:43.045
George Clinton won't forgive somebody after 20 years.

55:43.065 --> 55:48.253
No, if I was instant, I couldn't be doing this.

55:48.453 --> 55:49.214
I do read them.

55:49.234 --> 55:50.035
You know, I read them once.

55:50.156 --> 55:51.177
I don't save them.

55:51.197 --> 55:53.280
And I don't remember them particularly well.

55:53.300 --> 55:58.248
I have a sort of general sense, you know, of how things are going.

55:58.688 --> 56:12.950
And it matters to me a lot how the people I love feel about me as a person and what I'm doing and that they, you know, respect and care about me.

56:12.970 --> 56:14.913
But reviewers know.

56:14.933 --> 56:15.193
Excellent.

56:15.213 --> 56:15.474
Okay.

56:15.554 --> 56:17.717
If you don't mind, can we take a couple of shots?

56:19.317 --> 56:20.719
It's a lot, this thing.

56:20.739 --> 56:25.848
Speaking of George Clinton, I didn't experience them on this.

56:26.089 --> 56:27.030
This was new at the time.

56:27.712 --> 56:29.955
And because now it's, because it keeps going.

56:31.418 --> 56:33.782
It keeps reversing itself.

56:34.252 --> 56:40.062
I just kept going and I got home and I heard the music and the car, you know.

56:41.164 --> 56:45.672
But you have to, if you lock it, then as I just did there, yes.

56:45.732 --> 56:57.592
Now you can even try to record and it won't because it's locked.

56:58.634 --> 56:58.774
Anyway.

56:59.564 --> 57:27.192
What a smart thing that you know how to take pictures.

57:27.172 --> 57:42.683
Just so they know how fast they are.

57:49.345 --> 57:52.088
You're welcome.

57:52.128 --> 57:53.829
Thank you.

57:53.889 --> 58:01.116
Well, it's amazing the stories I can tell without any difficult art.

58:01.136 --> 58:04.839
You know, a few surprise photographs.

58:04.859 --> 58:06.080
I want to tell you, by the way.

58:06.321 --> 58:08.563
I've been told you, of course, a lot of people.

58:08.583 --> 58:08.783
Thank you.

58:08.803 --> 58:08.943
Oh, no.

58:08.963 --> 58:11.625
You know, my, um, my friend Maria Maguino, she, uh, has a family about her.

58:11.645 --> 58:12.066
I do, actually, yeah.

58:12.086 --> 58:12.947
Well, you're not a doctor.

58:12.987 --> 58:13.547
You're not a doctor.

58:13.567 --> 58:14.248
No, you're not a doctor.

58:14.268 --> 58:14.868
No, you're not a doctor.

58:14.888 --> 58:15.389
No, you're not a doctor.

58:15.409 --> 58:15.889
No, you're not a doctor.

58:15.909 --> 58:16.570
No, you're not a doctor.

58:16.590 --> 58:16.990
You're not a doctor.

58:17.090 --> 58:17.611
No, you're not a doctor.

58:17.671 --> 58:18.812
No, you're not a doctor.

58:18.792 --> 58:34.951
for her when she was there.

58:35.452 --> 58:38.716
I saw her last night in New York, but she lived there.

58:38.736 --> 58:39.837
Where do you think this would be?

58:39.857 --> 58:40.798
I think so, yeah.

58:40.818 --> 58:43.081
I hate taking you in restaurants.

58:43.181 --> 58:43.481
That's not bad.

58:43.501 --> 58:44.723
This doesn't necessarily have to be in a car.

58:44.743 --> 58:47.206
My wife checks off pictures.

58:47.226 --> 58:48.327
And we've never...

58:49.454 --> 59:01.255
I can get pictures of Pat Conley looking slim, but if I can do that, that's a pretty smile.

59:01.275 --> 59:07.105
Need another one?

59:07.125 --> 59:08.487
Well, these are excellent.

59:08.507 --> 59:09.589
Let's get a couple more slides.

59:16.437 --> 59:35.620
My older brother is a senior.

59:35.640 --> 59:40.466
We did it this summer.

59:40.486 --> 59:41.527
And then the younger one, they're just going to see.

59:41.547 --> 59:42.849
How about over here when we get some pizza?

59:42.869 --> 59:43.409
How much time have you got?

59:43.429 --> 59:43.870
You have five minutes?

59:43.890 --> 59:43.990
Yeah.

59:44.010 --> 59:44.511
So where did you go?

59:44.531 --> 59:44.931
We went up to Maine.

59:44.951 --> 59:45.271
I went to Bates.

59:45.291 --> 59:45.412
Bates?

59:45.432 --> 59:45.752
I went to Bates.

59:46.120 --> 01:00:07.718
You know, what can I say?

01:00:07.738 --> 01:00:08.179
You're a good student.

01:00:08.513 --> 01:00:30.028
Yeah, I'll be doing that with my son, Charlie, in the summer.

01:00:30.048 --> 01:00:30.529
It's exciting, isn't it?

01:00:30.549 --> 01:00:31.331
Actually, that part, I look forward to.

01:00:31.351 --> 01:00:32.032
One of the last ways of the music.

01:00:32.052 --> 01:00:32.452
I'm right over here.

01:00:32.472 --> 01:00:32.873
You're sitting down?

01:00:32.893 --> 01:00:32.993
Yeah.

01:00:33.013 --> 01:00:33.855
You won't get the background, don't worry.

01:00:33.875 --> 01:00:34.295
I mean, look at that.

01:00:34.315 --> 01:00:34.516
It's nice.

01:00:34.536 --> 01:00:34.856
It'll be lovely.

01:00:34.876 --> 01:00:35.177
It's beautiful.

01:00:35.197 --> 01:00:35.297
Okay.

01:00:36.020 --> 01:01:00.111
No, I'm just, there's a very interesting thing in the background.

01:01:00.131 --> 01:01:01.072
I just thought I might get better, but I'm not.

01:01:01.092 --> 01:01:01.192
Okay.

01:01:01.212 --> 01:01:01.432
No, please.

01:01:01.452 --> 01:01:01.793
Wow, picture you.

01:01:01.813 --> 01:01:02.934
You want to make a painting of this angry, bitter woman.

01:01:02.954 --> 01:01:03.155
Very nice.

01:01:03.175 --> 01:01:03.876
Like the whole life has been black.

01:01:03.896 --> 01:01:04.136
That's fine.

01:01:04.156 --> 01:01:04.637
I have a one right here.

01:01:04.657 --> 01:01:04.997
Right right here.

01:01:06.665 --> 01:01:15.375
I took some pictures of Tim O'Brien a couple years ago.

01:01:16.132 --> 01:01:17.754
He said, I had vanity fair in here.

01:01:17.774 --> 01:01:20.496
They took four hours to take his tickets.

01:01:20.516 --> 01:01:21.658
Oh, vanity fair took 14 hours.

01:01:21.678 --> 01:01:23.660
And he said, you did this in two minutes.

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:25.321
And I said, and you know what?

01:01:25.341 --> 01:01:27.203
He said, no, you don't have to tell me.

01:01:27.223 --> 01:01:29.906
He said, yours will be just as good.

01:01:30.326 --> 01:01:31.748
I said, they will be just as good.

01:01:31.928 --> 01:01:35.231
All I'm looking for is one good picture.

01:01:35.251 --> 01:01:36.252
And I always manage to get it.

01:01:36.272 --> 01:01:36.813
OK, thank you very much.

01:01:36.833 --> 01:01:37.213
Thanks a lot, Dave.

01:01:37.233 --> 01:01:38.054
And I wish you the best of luck.

01:01:38.074 --> 01:01:42.038
And I hope that the question will not be back there.

01:01:45.224 --> 01:01:49.811
Thank you very much.

01:01:50.354 --> 01:01:50.897
Bye-bye.

01:02:14.317 --> 01:02:16.665
you

01:03:26.153 --> 01:03:45.242
There you go.

01:04:01.152 --> 01:04:02.135
Mm-hmm.

01:04:47.187 --> 01:04:49.892
What's their 90th anniversary of doing just that?

01:04:50.032 --> 01:04:54.921
We're at the New York Stock Exchange with CIT Group's President and CEO, Al Gamble, Jr.

01:04:54.941 --> 01:04:58.587
There are a lot of companies that have come and gone through that 90-year period.

01:04:58.607 --> 01:04:59.469
Why have we survived?

01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:02.614
It had a lot to do with the financial strength and stability of the organization.

01:05:02.754 --> 01:05:04.137
A strong survive.

01:05:04.157 --> 01:05:06.040
What else has contributed to your success?

01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:13.108
Technology has absolutely played a critical role in our development.

01:05:13.128 --> 01:05:14.809
It has improved productivity dramatically.

01:05:14.889 --> 01:05:16.731
In 1980-89, we had about $8 to $9 billion in assets.

01:05:16.751 --> 01:05:19.094
We had an organization that started from $8 billion to $23 billion.

01:05:19.114 --> 01:05:20.435
We're basically the same headcount.

01:05:20.455 --> 01:05:21.677
And how important is where you live?

01:05:21.697 --> 01:05:27.063
Whenever we had a second thought of CIT as to where we were going to live, it was going back to the premium exchange in the world.

01:05:27.083 --> 01:05:33.850
When we do our advertising today, we use the New York Stock Exchange symbol, which shows that the CIT group could accompany your company.

01:05:33.970 --> 01:05:35.031
The New York Stock Exchange.

01:05:35.011 --> 01:05:42.802
The world's pretty dark tonight.

01:05:42.922 --> 01:05:49.772
On Wall Street, just before the half hour, the Dow Jones 30 is up 195 points at $79.91.

01:05:49.792 --> 01:05:52.175
And now, Jack and Pompter deck is up 29 points at $16.71.

01:05:52.195 --> 01:05:54.579

You know, WBC is Diane.

01:05:59.165 --> 01:05:59.285
Hello.

01:05:59.305 --> 01:05:59.425
Hello.

01:05:59.445 --> 01:05:59.746
How's it going?

01:05:59.766 --> 01:06:00.066
How's it going?

01:06:00.086 --> 01:06:00.387
How's it going?

01:06:00.407 --> 01:06:00.807
Can we just be here?

01:06:00.827 --> 01:06:01.288
Here's a wonderful one.

01:06:02.433 --> 01:06:10.688
Can you have it, please don't.

01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:24.241
Oh, yes.

01:06:24.261 --> 01:06:26.983
I don't think I'm doing it.

01:06:27.003 --> 01:06:28.645
Have you ever smoked a soda?

01:06:28.665 --> 01:06:29.286
Have you thought of it?

01:06:29.306 --> 01:06:32.208
What was liquidate in CQ, there is no one-year step.

01:06:32.228 --> 01:06:32.609
CQ has three steps.

01:06:32.629 --> 01:06:37.053
When you step down your birth gradually, that's the message, Dr. Pagan Pharmacy says, liquidate in CQ, the power to calm, the power to comfort, the power to help you quit.

01:06:37.073 --> 01:06:38.074
You've only got directed in the close of yourself.

01:07:11.052 --> 01:07:20.270
Every day more New Englanders turn to WBZ than any other radio station.

01:07:20.290 --> 01:07:20.911
We are News Radio.

01:07:20.932 --> 01:07:21.192
WBZ Fox 6.

01:07:22.268 --> 01:07:28.456
It's today, Boston temperature 71 degrees and cloudy skies.

01:07:28.836 --> 01:07:34.563
There will be the AccuWeather Meteorologist Terry Clinton-Hemmer calls for mostly cloudy skies.

01:07:34.603 --> 01:07:37.246
They'll have a shower at around 64 degrees.

01:07:37.266 --> 01:07:38.828
Tomorrow, warm, size of around 86.

01:07:38.848 --> 01:07:44.455
It'll be more humid, we'll have some clouds and some sky, there is a chance of a shower or thunderstorm tomorrow.

01:07:44.475 --> 01:07:47.719
I've died answering WDD news and his fortune of the news has been brought to you by Savings Bank Life Insurance.

01:07:47.699 --> 01:08:15.040
Because it's fast and it's not prone to go as close to go it says,

01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:24.112
If you were an idle on Stellwagen Bank, some whales are curious, and they may come close to a vessel to look at it, but maybe whales are not known to come very close to boats.

01:08:24.332 --> 01:08:33.645
McDonald says there are a lot of questions as to why this happened, how fast was the whale watch boat going, and what kind of precautions were being taken, knowing that whales were in the area.

01:08:34.225 --> 01:08:37.129
Carol Lennon, WBC News Radio 1030.

01:08:37.149 --> 01:08:42.917
Representatives from the world's most powerful industrial democracy today discuss economic crisis in Russia and around the globe.

01:08:42.897 --> 01:08:51.214
The G7 deputies didn't come up with any concrete recommendations on ways to help, but they weren't supposed to.

01:08:51.234 --> 01:09:02.357
Recession was intended mostly to update everyone on the current situation and give them a chance to share analysis.

01:09:02.337 --> 01:09:14.955
As one British official put it, the deputies did agree to West to continue to back economic reforms as long as those reforms took Russia in the right direction.

01:09:14.975 --> 01:09:19.782
There was an introduction to the representatives of the new government of Yiv-Gun and Klimakoff on hand for about an hour and a half.

01:09:19.802 --> 01:09:22.085
Overall, the British official, speaking on condition of anonymity, calls reception of good meaning.

01:09:22.105 --> 01:09:25.290
He says he's encouraged the new Russian government to still interested in continuing dialogue with the West.

01:09:25.270 --> 01:09:36.965
Hearing some lenders in New York are afraid that it's all in global economic crisis, the biggest financial challenge facing the world in a half century.

01:09:37.085 --> 01:09:42.092
Inside both the president and president's secretary, Robert Rubin, echoes the best shares reading here that inflation is no longer the major threat.

01:09:42.112 --> 01:09:44.595
So the lady said the president was not actually asking the federal reserve to lower interest rates.

01:09:44.575 --> 01:10:01.156
While in New York today, the President adjured a reporter's question about the Monica Malincy affair.

01:10:01.176 --> 01:10:02.858
Some of the President's supporters have been on Park Avenue at this Motorcade Live.

01:10:02.878 --> 01:10:04.981
Neighborhood President Paul Akelle was asked about the police to matter, and the Ken Stern investigation.

01:10:05.001 --> 01:10:06.583
I think what he did do, not properly, but he certainly didn't come to New York.

01:10:06.563 --> 01:10:18.311
And, uh, I'd like to know what happened to the 40 million dollars for detection, conducting investigation.

01:10:18.331 --> 01:10:21.177
Apparel says he doesn't think the president should be impeached, but that he shouldn't be punished.

01:10:21.197 --> 01:10:23.262
The Capitol Hill that has signed impeachment proceedings could begin before election day.

01:10:23.282 --> 01:10:24.505
Now, Priganeet Ingress says they've made that historic.

01:10:25.582 --> 01:10:39.882
The whole society learns from the White House in a very careful, in a very conscious manner, and in a real sense of doing constitutional.

01:10:39.902 --> 01:10:46.712
Interesting comment today from the man who ran against Bill Clinton in the last election, Bob Dole says the president made a chance of holding on to his job.

01:10:46.692 --> 01:10:58.509
Joe was not calling for legislation, but says to me, Joe tried to alert voters during a campaign about the cancer issue.

01:10:58.529 --> 01:11:03.997
Joe landed these reminders of Watergate, and that Richard Hickson's initial phone numbers were just as strong as President Clinton's are now.

01:11:04.017 --> 01:11:04.738
Senator BBS, sign in on 3-day-free.

01:11:04.758 --> 01:11:07.061
We hit campus on the freeze with Pete Forrest, like you by V1.

01:11:07.081 --> 01:11:08.143
This is our band, this is The Web.

01:11:08.123 --> 01:11:10.465
All right, thank you, Diane.

01:11:10.605 --> 01:11:15.470
In town, just a few delays moving at the 93, a little tight at the merge.

01:11:15.490 --> 01:11:18.113
It is getting four-ish, both ways on the artery.

01:11:18.133 --> 01:11:20.355
This person's job is crowded down towards South Bay.

01:11:20.455 --> 01:11:21.896
The Northbound is pretty decent.

01:11:21.916 --> 01:11:23.958
Down there, some of them being good shit.

01:11:23.978 --> 01:11:26.181
So I'll drive them down to some volume in front of the half general.

01:11:26.461 --> 01:11:28.983
The mass plane westbound is okay all the way out towards Brainingham.

01:11:29.003 --> 01:11:31.666
Rule 3 on the south shore checks out fine down through Weymouth.

01:11:31.686 --> 01:11:33.228
The 93 Northbound, a clear shot at past 128 to 145.

01:11:33.248 --> 01:11:35.049
128, the upper and lower half so far check out fine.

01:11:35.069 --> 01:11:36.831
We'll check the annualized in 10 minutes.

01:11:36.811 --> 01:11:39.274
This is the way.

01:11:39.294 --> 01:11:40.655
Hi, Ray here.

01:11:40.675 --> 01:11:41.596
Mr. No-Nonsense.

01:11:41.616 --> 01:11:46.722
My favorite food is toast.

01:11:47.062 --> 01:11:49.845
I can't tell you anything.

01:11:49.865 --> 01:12:00.777
That's why Catings Bank Life Insurance has me tell you about their no-nonsense approach to

01:12:03.203 --> 01:12:09.473
companies are offering really low for third-plus rates on some policies.

01:12:09.573 --> 01:12:10.574
Low prices sound great, right?

01:12:10.594 --> 01:12:10.775
Nonsense.

01:12:11.235 --> 01:12:15.802
What they fail to tell you is that all too often these duper-duper rates are not easy to get.

01:12:15.822 --> 01:12:19.468
So in what you run marathons, you may end up with a higher rate.

01:12:19.488 --> 01:12:22.533
But with STLI, it's simple.

01:12:22.553 --> 01:12:30.004
Example, a healthy 25-year-old non-smoker can get a $300,000 Rebel Premium 25-year policy for about $20 a month.

01:12:29.984 --> 01:12:45.006
It's not glamorous, it's life insurance.

01:12:44.986 --> 01:12:48.192
They do accept Marathon.

01:12:48.272 --> 01:12:50.876
It's a five-time policy on their bill.

01:12:51.437 --> 01:12:52.118
WBG News time at 3.35.

01:12:52.138 --> 01:13:01.415
Your development today in a highly publicized case involving the Jenny Jones TV talk show was a day in a field court in Michigan that overturned the murder condition of Jonathan Smith.

01:13:01.575 --> 01:13:07.365
He's the man who was found guilty of cheating another man who revealed his sister's crush on him during a taping of these Jenny Jones films.

01:13:07.767 --> 01:13:14.017
The Boston High School is getting a classroom season.

01:13:14.037 --> 01:13:22.050
The Philanthropist is giving $100 million to the English High to help them cut in the job that way.

01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:25.656
What would you believe you've called Stephen, has that story?

01:13:25.676 --> 01:13:28.861
The motto of today's legitimately feel-good story over at English High School comes from the New Testament.

01:13:28.881 --> 01:13:29.381
And you shall receive it.

01:13:29.402 --> 01:13:33.488
English High School is not the only high school where the transition from middle school to the United States has been turned to be very problematic.

01:13:33.468 --> 01:13:42.530
The very simple and complicated answer to that question why in high school is they ask.

01:13:42.551 --> 01:13:43.373
And today, they received.

01:13:43.393 --> 01:13:50.430
Sam Trussler delivered half a million dollars from the Trussler Foundation, money that will help fund expertise and share of professionals to focus on freshmen with an upcoming health this year.

01:13:50.410 --> 01:13:56.000
Soon they end up being freshmen again next fall.

01:13:56.020 --> 01:13:57.843
A circuit airplane has been hijacked.

01:13:57.863 --> 01:14:00.368
There are reports 76 people are on board.

01:14:00.388 --> 01:14:04.054
The plane is apparently hijacked shortly after taking off from an airport in Istanbul.

01:14:04.575 --> 01:14:07.140
The hijackers ordered the plane to fly to the Black Sea.

01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:10.005
No word on what the hijackers actually want.

01:14:09.985 --> 01:14:19.163
On Capitol Hill today, lawmakers are talking about the problem of use in nursing homes across the country.

01:14:19.203 --> 01:14:22.269
Senator Herb Cole says it needs to be stopped.

01:14:22.289 --> 01:14:26.678
The United States, there were 13,469 complaints of abuse, aggression, theft, sanitation, nursing homes, and board and care facilities.

01:14:26.658 --> 01:14:42.906
In addition to that, the nursing home staff admits the committee of these grants of physical abuse and forced to commit to psychological abuse.

01:14:42.966 --> 01:14:48.415
During the hearing, well, we've heard from people who have found in that report here, following us at home, among them Richard Mayer, a 92-year-old mother with sexual assault.

01:14:48.435 --> 01:14:50.539
The Mayer family was outraged as to why and how this is handled.

01:14:50.519 --> 01:14:56.410
for such a tiny, scary, lovely place.

01:14:56.670 --> 01:14:59.255
And she had only been in the nursing home a lot for 45 years.

01:14:59.275 --> 01:15:04.985
A new government report finds nursing homes in this country do not do enough to prevent people with criminal records from working.

01:15:05.005 --> 01:15:10.335
Government auditors to sound that nursing homes employ a significant number of workers who have committed crimes.

01:15:11.137 --> 01:15:14.603
That was a busy news time at 3.38, over checking Wall Street, coming up.

01:15:14.583 --> 01:15:22.242
Within the next 10 minutes, you'll get a complete happy weather forecast.

01:15:22.262 --> 01:15:23.986
Weather every 10 minutes.

01:15:24.006 --> 01:15:24.908
Weather every hour.

01:15:24.928 --> 01:15:26.512
What do you mean?

01:15:26.532 --> 01:15:29.319
Oh, what happened while I was on vacation?

01:15:29.339 --> 01:15:30.241
I was on high sea optical network.

01:15:30.261 --> 01:15:32.727
I messed up the ram on all of these things.

01:15:32.707 --> 01:15:39.012
I've heard it's a new Panasonic Digital Copier Printer.

01:15:39.093 --> 01:15:40.013
Who are you?

01:15:40.033 --> 01:15:40.634
And why a cop?

01:15:40.734 --> 01:15:42.916
Well, sir, I'm Bob, and it's a Panasonic Digital Copier Printer.

01:15:42.936 --> 01:15:44.677
It's in spelling, warrants, and print letters.

01:15:44.797 --> 01:15:47.480
It has electronic sorting, and it's one of the most productive in the business.

01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:47.720
Okay, Bill.

01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:48.080
I'm sorry, sir.

01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:48.361
That's Bob.

01:15:48.381 --> 01:15:50.302
Anyway, now everyone can manage documents right from their desktop.

01:15:50.342 --> 01:15:51.623
They can all be networked together, too.

01:15:51.643 --> 01:15:53.105
No need for all those expensive things.

01:15:53.125 --> 01:15:53.545
Right.

01:15:53.585 --> 01:15:54.246
It saves time and money.

01:15:54.366 --> 01:15:55.867
Sounds interesting, Bob.

01:15:56.488 --> 01:15:56.808
Bob.

01:15:56.828 --> 01:16:00.191
And it even has a revolutionary file management capability called the HyperDocument System.

01:16:00.211 --> 01:16:01.972
You can retrieve files from anywhere on the network.

01:16:01.992 --> 01:16:02.713
How are you playing, Bill?

01:16:45.858 --> 01:16:47.180

01:18:18.186 --> 01:18:20.428
In Boston now, it's just 71 degrees.

01:18:20.448 --> 01:18:21.669

01:18:21.689 --> 01:18:21.810
Yeah.

01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:24.412
Ever wonder what could happen to passengers and drop them in over that express barge?

01:18:24.432 --> 01:18:24.532
Whoa.

01:18:24.552 --> 01:18:24.652
Yeah.

01:18:24.672 --> 01:18:26.735
I was wondering what was going on in the back of my room.

01:18:26.755 --> 01:18:27.415

01:20:17.135 --> 01:20:29.433
Lower deck in 93 is just an energy congestion, some are in front of the head in the side, solid driving and bouncing just back to the front of Mannington General.

01:20:29.453 --> 01:20:32.558
High westbound is might have been going so far heading out towards West Houston.

01:20:32.578 --> 01:20:34.641
Moor 3 on the south shore, south front of Mannington will down through Rainey.

01:20:34.741 --> 01:20:38.166
And the 93 northbound clear shadow path 128.5, upper and lower head to 128.4 to check out time for the most part.

We'll check in January, Marching and Edmunds, East Geller, so we need 820 quality traffic network.

01:20:41.992 --> 01:20:52.407
Hi, I'm Willie Nelson.

01:20:52.507 --> 01:21:00.158
I've used my music to help working families in any way that I can.

01:21:00.178 --> 01:21:02.000
And I'm always looking for people who will join me in the fight.

01:21:02.020 --> 01:21:04.403
And I've got a friend in Massachusetts who's been married at the time I've asked for a sister.

01:21:04.424 --> 01:21:05.966
I know you've heard of him, his name is John O'Connor.

01:21:05.986 --> 01:21:08.730
And we still know John because he's done a lot to protect working families from the point he's sold out to the nation's leadership.

01:21:08.750 --> 01:21:09.531
But that's not all he's done.

01:21:09.551 --> 01:21:11.914
And I know because I've worked with John O'Connor to help farmers across the country when they get hard times.

01:21:11.894 --> 01:21:30.463
And each time that's been made in John's town, he just wanted to help.

01:21:30.483 --> 01:21:32.506
And it seems like whenever a working family's in trouble with John, it always doesn't do what he can.

01:21:32.527 --> 01:21:34.069
And I don't usually endorse for the change, but John O'Connor has his sister.

01:21:34.089 --> 01:21:35.291
He might be running for Congress, but he's not a politician.

01:21:35.311 --> 01:21:36.513
He can die, he can fight with a working family all the time.

01:21:36.533 --> 01:21:37.294
He's pulled by the O'Connor Committee.

01:21:38.523 --> 01:21:51.240
So the Red Sox and their losing streak have moved itself into the Bronx for the next two days.

01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:57.929
And to say they are living in the Yankee Stadium or that should be said against the Yankees might be an understatement.

01:21:57.949 --> 01:22:02.075
They still do lead in the wild side by four over Toronto in the rock column and five in the Sandway over Texas.

01:22:02.095 --> 01:22:04.178
But their smile pointed down with eight losses in the last 10 years.

01:22:04.198 --> 01:22:05.440
Tonight, a huge contest with Pedro Martinez.

01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:08.023
The Red Sox states, of course, working against Orlando Hernandez.

01:22:08.003 --> 01:22:13.470
A Patriots a one-on-one after their season 29-6 win over Indianapolis last night in Foxborough.

01:22:13.690 --> 01:22:15.792
The Patriots had good performances for many last nights.

01:22:15.812 --> 01:22:19.216
The Sky Law had two picks and a touchdown, two butts over steady.

01:22:19.317 --> 01:22:22.741
He was in the inner sports to fumble with a sack.

01:22:22.861 --> 01:22:25.684
And second year quarterback, Chris Kennedy recorded his first career interception.

01:22:25.744 --> 01:22:26.125
He's really big.

01:22:26.145 --> 01:22:28.207
He's like a baby taking the first step.

01:22:28.708 --> 01:22:29.809
And now, hopefully,

01:22:29.789 --> 01:22:41.449
I know I got the first one over, I can get a lot more, a lot more.

01:22:41.469 --> 01:22:42.310
But it's been a great situation out there.

01:22:42.330 --> 01:22:43.092
You know, I just reacted, but I'm sad.

01:22:43.112 --> 01:22:43.973
I've been happy, and I'm happy to win, man.

01:22:43.993 --> 01:22:45.115
You know, kind of just glad me.

01:22:45.095 --> 01:22:50.123
The Patriots played Tennessee Orleans here in Foxborough next Monday afternoon.

01:22:50.143 --> 01:22:51.565
On the lead yesterday, lots of injuries.

01:22:51.725 --> 01:22:53.668
John Elway, a hamstring pull.

01:22:53.688 --> 01:22:54.750
Troy Aikman broke his shoulder.

01:22:54.830 --> 01:22:55.792
He's got six to eight weeks.

01:22:55.852 --> 01:22:58.315
Brad Johnson, the Minnesota quarterback, broke his leg.

01:22:58.536 --> 01:22:59.497
He's gone for half a season.

01:22:59.878 --> 01:23:03.323
And Green Bay Dorsey Levin's had a sprained ankle for about 24 hours.

01:23:03.343 --> 01:23:05.747
It's now a fracture according to X-rays.

01:23:05.767 --> 01:23:07.069
He's gone for six weeks.

01:23:07.049 --> 01:23:27.690
... ... ... ... ... ...

01:23:28.784 --> 01:23:38.080
We're not going to surprise anybody or anybody.

01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:46.995
Luckily we're going to have to go out there and have to share.

01:23:46.975 --> 01:24:03.382
It's going to be even more difficult, but with another year under a lot of these rookie spells, I think we're going to be an improved game, and I think we're going to have at least people listening.

01:24:03.402 --> 01:24:04.143
I think a lot better.

01:24:04.163 --> 01:24:06.347
You can find some room space for Canadians in their first exhibition game, Saturday night in Montreal.

01:24:06.367 --> 01:24:07.449

01:24:26.970 --> 01:24:27.290

Hello, the global economy and the crisis in Washington.

01:25:24.352 --> 01:25:31.099
G7 leaders gathered in London today to meet about the world's financial situation and what's happening in Russia.

01:25:31.119 --> 01:25:36.724
Leaders still agree with President Clinton that the greatest threat to the world economy is recession, not inflation.

01:25:36.744 --> 01:25:41.629
In Washington, President Clinton's supporters are trying to put the best face on the situation in the wake of the Star Report.

01:25:41.669 --> 01:25:44.892
Democratic Anderson Tom Rano from California says the media is paying so much attention to what's going on inside the Delaware.

01:25:44.912 --> 01:25:45.913
The world has not come to a standstill.

01:25:46.568 --> 01:25:52.765
People across the globe are not as mesmerized by topic number one,

01:25:52.998 --> 01:25:56.722
as the media seems to be here in the United States.

01:25:56.782 --> 01:25:58.884
USA Today is calling them to be gone.

01:25:59.104 --> 01:26:06.491
Others, smaller newspaper, say the president should step down, while still others say Congress and the American people should not rush to judgment.

01:26:06.511 --> 01:26:09.474
Also today, collisions between whales and boats are rare.

01:26:09.814 --> 01:26:12.137
But there was another incident over the weekend.

01:26:12.157 --> 01:26:14.479
A whale watch boat out of the cave killed a minky whale.

01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:17.982
The boat whale watcher was returning to Bonstable Harbor.

01:26:18.042 --> 01:26:22.667
When a collider was a 20-foot animal, hundreds of passengers were on boats at the time.

01:26:22.951 --> 01:26:27.658
WBZ news time at 3.50, kind of a mixed bag weather-wise, Thursday extended.

Chance of a shower and thunderstorm, especially in the afternoon and evening hours, high tomorrow at 86.

01:26:48.854 --> 01:26:53.971

01:26:57.503 --> 01:26:59.269
We should see clouds start to break.
