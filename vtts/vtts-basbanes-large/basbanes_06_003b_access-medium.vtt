00:02.157 --> 00:12.911
I said we've got a lot of projects that are floating there in the background that we're developing, either to publish ourselves or to pursue someone else.

00:12.951 --> 00:15.715
We're going to do a baby book ourselves, for example.

00:15.735 --> 00:19.340
So we're always looking for images for our baby book.

00:20.562 --> 00:23.085
By now we've got five times as much as we'll ever use.

00:23.268 --> 00:44.382
we were for example when we were doing just recently we were doing these animal books for chronicle so we were watching for our three animals yeah right yeah there were we it was rabbits dogs and um

00:45.053 --> 00:47.236
horses, rabbits, dogs, and horses.

00:47.256 --> 00:54.504
So in a show like this, we have our eyes particularly open for rabbits, dogs, and horses of a certain kind that we know chronicles.

00:54.524 --> 00:55.505
Which name do you use?

00:55.525 --> 00:56.346
Do you use different names?

00:56.887 --> 00:57.347
For what?

00:57.367 --> 00:59.550
For the books that you publish with a different publisher.

01:01.372 --> 01:02.974
No, not really.

01:02.994 --> 01:04.936
I mean, those are just Blue Lantern usually.

01:05.196 --> 01:08.721
I mean, they don't usually have an author that's compiled by the Blue Lantern or something.

01:10.322 --> 01:11.404
Is your husband obsessed?

01:11.884 --> 01:13.746
Is he an obsessive collector?

01:13.766 --> 01:14.267
Well,

01:14.399 --> 01:17.082
You've already said that you're not.

01:17.162 --> 01:17.563
Yeah.

01:18.344 --> 01:21.868
I think it's just a little bit different.

01:21.928 --> 01:27.856
I mean, his collecting is a little wider, but mine is more narrow.

01:28.356 --> 01:36.026
I mean, I'll collect books of reproduction, something of painters that I particularly like.

01:36.526 --> 01:42.794
I'll collect things on fashion and dressmaking and so forth of eras that I'm particularly concerned with.

01:42.814 --> 01:43.495
I'll collect

01:43.812 --> 01:46.317
But you get really excited when you find something.

01:46.337 --> 01:47.039
Oh, sure, of course.

01:47.059 --> 01:49.023
I mean... Yeah, of course, right.

01:51.007 --> 02:03.492
Books on... And then, of course, I collect for my area of the Blue Lantern, which is design, typography... Do you have some kind of literature about the Blue Lantern that you could send me?

02:03.860 --> 02:08.726
Any stories written about it just around?

02:09.107 --> 02:12.571
I think everything you have is too outdated to be.

02:12.591 --> 02:19.380
Just something so I can have a feel of what Blue Lantern is.

02:19.721 --> 02:24.467
It's kind of hard to say.

02:24.869 --> 02:34.322
As I say, he's collecting for things he's got in the back of his mind, too, if you're kind of... Well, see, he's collecting for things, but for projects now, exactly.

02:34.342 --> 02:35.824
One of the things about... And things he loves.

02:35.884 --> 02:37.546
I mean, he loves lanterns.

02:37.566 --> 02:41.852
So he'll always collect a lantern, for example, a good picture of a lantern.

02:42.493 --> 02:44.936
He loves costumes and masquerade and things.

02:44.956 --> 02:46.459
He doesn't know quite what he's going to do with them yet.

02:46.939 --> 02:49.042
But someday, something will come.

02:49.843 --> 02:53.408
One of the cute things about this kind of collecting is...

02:54.569 --> 02:58.644
I mean, as a book collector, I have kind of a vague idea of what I'm looking for.

02:58.684 --> 02:59.587
Right.

02:59.607 --> 03:01.153
And I have a wand list up here.

03:01.173 --> 03:01.474
Right.

03:01.554 --> 03:02.879
Well, of course, we have that, too.

03:03.621 --> 03:05.187
But you...

03:06.027 --> 03:07.930
A lot of this is so serendipitous.

03:08.190 --> 03:13.939
You're finding, you're discovering things, the existence of them, and you're learning of their existence from the very first time.

03:13.999 --> 03:14.480
That's true.

03:14.580 --> 03:16.323
But they tend to be in an area.

03:16.343 --> 03:18.066
But then he also collects some other things.

03:18.126 --> 03:20.029
For example, he has a F. Woodhouse collection.

03:20.049 --> 03:20.830
Woodhouse, P.G.

03:21.150 --> 03:21.691
Woodhouse.

03:21.711 --> 03:22.152
Oh, okay.

03:22.172 --> 03:22.412
P.G.

03:22.452 --> 03:23.875
Woodhouse.

03:24.095 --> 03:28.782
And so he's got his book, and he knows what he has and what he doesn't have.

03:29.123 --> 03:30.685
He has...

03:30.665 --> 03:37.171
That's probably the biggest one you've got.

03:37.231 --> 03:38.392
There are several authors.

03:38.452 --> 03:45.498
I like the Victorian novel, and so I have a certain number of them.

03:45.518 --> 03:48.040
I like Don Buckingham.

03:48.060 --> 03:49.862
I like Don Buckingham.

03:51.443 --> 03:52.344
B-U-C-K-A-N.

03:54.906 --> 03:58.329
And I like the adult novel.

03:58.469 --> 04:00.351
I like the children's novel, too.

04:00.770 --> 04:03.160
Francis Hodge and Burnett.

04:03.180 --> 04:07.860
Her adult novels are interesting.

04:08.279 --> 04:13.887
How ballpark, how big is the collections?

04:13.907 --> 04:14.969
I don't know.

04:15.009 --> 04:16.311
My husband's going to make the cards.

04:16.331 --> 04:17.493
He could tell you about the Blue Rat.

04:17.673 --> 04:19.316
You see the collections and collections.

04:19.336 --> 04:23.462
There's the one that has the cards on, which is the picture book collection.

04:23.482 --> 04:26.206
Then there's the reference collection, which includes all the art books.

04:26.226 --> 04:31.013
I mean, all the books on Winslow Homer and Corot and the people I pretty like.

04:31.263 --> 04:37.173
And then there are, I mean, then the books on German toys and so forth.

04:37.273 --> 04:43.423
Then there are, and I've got my fashion collection, which I don't know, I don't want to tell.

04:43.444 --> 04:48.993
And then there are all the books on authors that we like, I mean, you know, various people.

04:49.033 --> 04:53.480
Then there are the reference books, and then the travel books.

04:53.500 --> 04:55.043
So Harold's probably going to have a figure.

04:55.394 --> 05:01.609
Well, being an old bookman, he probably knows, you know, well, let's see, we've got approximately this many feet.

05:01.629 --> 05:04.576
50,000 wagons, you think, in the house?

05:04.596 --> 05:04.696
What?

05:05.398 --> 05:06.140
Don't even ask me.

05:06.260 --> 05:07.102
I don't know.

05:07.202 --> 05:09.167
How many rooms do you have stuck?

05:10.295 --> 05:13.520
It's hard to count.

05:13.620 --> 05:14.541
I mean, they're everywhere.

05:14.561 --> 05:15.783
I don't know.

05:16.644 --> 05:29.603
I mean, you know, there's a bookcase in the bedroom, and there's a bookcase in the studio, and the artworks.

05:29.583 --> 05:35.711
I took over the closet in there, and I put in shelves, and there were tons of books in there.

05:35.731 --> 05:40.217
Yeah, I mean, there are books in the living room, there are books in the television room, there are books in the kitchen.

05:40.237 --> 05:42.159
We added a room in the post last week.

05:42.179 --> 05:42.420
Books.

05:42.940 --> 05:46.645
Yeah, well, you know, they're down the stairs, and down the hall.

05:46.846 --> 05:48.728
You have a basement probably.

05:48.748 --> 05:50.190
Well, not a usable one.

05:50.210 --> 05:52.693
I'm going to let you go back to your show.

05:52.914 --> 05:54.055
Would you do...

05:54.423 --> 05:59.117
Really, I... My husband took my pen, though, so I'm just going to use it.

05:59.519 --> 06:01.123
This is a ballpoint pen.

06:01.224 --> 06:01.866
This one's for Nicole.

06:02.668 --> 06:04.413
Nicole, spell there anyone else?

06:04.514 --> 06:05.196
N-I-C-O-L-E.

06:05.216 --> 06:05.918
I'll check this out.
