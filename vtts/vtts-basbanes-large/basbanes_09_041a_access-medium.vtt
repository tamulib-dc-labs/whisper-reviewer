00:04.030 --> 00:20.451
Do you see Spear as a tragic hero?

00:20.732 --> 00:21.573
Let's start with that.

00:22.454 --> 00:23.475
Absolutely not.

00:23.836 --> 00:25.738
Absolutely not.

00:26.319 --> 00:30.865
I think that's, you know, the only tragic thing about Spear

00:39.788 --> 00:48.379
only limited, was unable to pronounce the words that he so wanted to pronounce about his guilt.

00:48.700 --> 00:50.422
That was the only tragic thing about him.

00:50.783 --> 00:54.167
He had a wonderful time under Hitler.

00:54.588 --> 00:55.249
Let's face it.

00:55.269 --> 00:57.392
And I think we have to make that very clear.

00:57.612 --> 01:00.215
Oh, doubly clear, triply clear.

01:00.235 --> 01:09.728
And one of the problems, you see, is, in fact, with the many people, or with many of the people, because there were some exceptions, who interviewed him, that they were unable to make

01:09.978 --> 01:16.387
the distinction between the Speer of under Hitler and the Speer of later.

01:17.249 --> 01:23.558
And so they really weren't very interested, let's face it, in the Speer of later.

01:24.179 --> 01:25.581
They weren't?

01:25.801 --> 01:26.422
No, they weren't.

01:26.763 --> 01:27.364
Why is that?

01:27.684 --> 01:39.141
Well, because, you know, not the sensational, but I mean the really interesting thing, part of it, was the horror of the Speer of the days under Hitler.

01:39.509 --> 01:48.198
and whatever he did with himself later, except for the two books, of course, and his psychological problems and developments.

01:49.139 --> 01:51.801
Well, they weren't really interested in that.

01:51.821 --> 01:53.463
To me, though, it's the most interesting thing.

01:53.503 --> 01:56.166
Yes, but that's why you're talking to me now, having written this book.

01:56.546 --> 02:01.951
But the point is that... How can a man of this intelligence be seduced into something so unspeakable?

02:02.071 --> 02:02.512
Absolutely.

02:02.552 --> 02:05.375
Wouldn't you think that they would want to know that?

02:05.895 --> 02:07.677
But very few people did.

02:07.943 --> 02:10.526
That's the crying question of our century, I think.

02:10.546 --> 02:15.473
It is the crying, but you know, I'll tell you something interesting as you're bringing this up.

02:15.974 --> 02:19.698
I think it really is a question of how life has developed.

02:19.738 --> 02:21.741
For instance, just a little example.

02:22.722 --> 02:26.047
When I wrote Into That Darkness, you know about that book, don't you?

02:26.067 --> 02:26.147
Yes.

02:26.688 --> 02:30.753
We're going to have a conversation from which I'll derive a piece.

02:30.773 --> 02:31.854
Whatever, yes.

02:31.874 --> 02:36.921
Well, that was the book where I talked with the commandant of Treblinka, Steinberg.

02:37.998 --> 02:40.281
And I did that in 1974.

02:40.362 --> 02:42.305
I mean, I did that in 1971.

02:42.545 --> 02:44.488
The book was published in 1974.

02:45.309 --> 02:49.956
And although it was, you know, well-received, it had problems.

02:50.617 --> 03:02.816
And the problems were that people really could not bear the thought, some people, sorry, some people, not bear the thought of my wishing to talk to someone like that.

03:03.437 --> 03:06.942
Well, now you see, this sort of esprit, you know,

03:07.445 --> 03:11.411
Really, this atmosphere continued for a long time.

03:12.152 --> 03:18.582
And it is only now, since maybe five, six years, that this atmosphere has changed.

03:19.243 --> 03:24.070
And that people are beginning to, as you say, ask themselves how or why.

03:24.110 --> 03:36.388
And as they are now asking themselves that, permit themselves to ask themselves that, they see why someone like I or others might wish to speak to people.

03:36.892 --> 03:37.933
you know, to find out.

03:38.294 --> 03:49.228
See, if he is willing to open up to you or to anyone, then he does offer an uncommon window, doesn't he, into the madness, so to speak.

03:49.408 --> 03:51.130
Yes, he does.

03:51.290 --> 03:53.794
And, of course, they were all interested in the madness.

03:54.354 --> 04:04.107
But what they were not interested in is the psychomoral side of the man, which is what I'm interested in.

04:04.427 --> 04:05.429
The individual man.

04:05.469 --> 04:06.510
That's right, exactly.

04:06.710 --> 04:34.455
Because I think the individual man, in the end, the individual man, under all circumstances, you know, the individual, if you like, the individual man today in Bosnia, the individual man in Nigeria, the individual man in the Khmer Rouge, we don't know enough about individual man, and if we don't, we'll never understand the society, we'll never understand the social and pathological developments.

04:34.638 --> 04:35.479
Do you agree?

04:35.499 --> 04:36.860
Oh, of course, absolutely.

04:36.880 --> 04:41.205
And it is interesting to me that you didn't pursue him.

04:42.146 --> 04:42.866
It was the other way around.

04:42.886 --> 04:43.287
Yeah, he pursued me.

04:43.667 --> 04:45.229
Yes, and that is a question.

04:45.249 --> 04:49.053
I'm not necessarily suggesting that he pursued you, but he certainly made the first contact.

04:49.133 --> 04:51.115
Oh, yes, and he made more than the first contact.

04:51.135 --> 05:04.408
I mean, he, you know, when he felt that I was, and I was, reticent after he had made this first contact, when I didn't, when he suggested that would I like to come to Heidelberg and

05:04.574 --> 05:28.354
would i like to come and see him i didn't say oh yes i'll come next week or if i can you know something i said well it's very kind of you um nice to talk to you and uh he then called me practically every week do you think he was seeking approbation do you think no he was he was really not he was questing for an apologist no no no you see that isn't it he was

05:28.638 --> 05:31.121
But it took me a long time to understand this.

05:31.221 --> 05:32.363
All this was in there, of course.

05:32.423 --> 05:37.369
I know, I'm just saying that, of course, I did try to explain all this.

05:39.272 --> 05:54.051
No, he was looking, he was trying to find someone who would force him to, or would help him, if you like, to pronounce this terrible guilt that he felt.

05:54.392 --> 05:57.075
Now, I was not the first one, you know, he came with this.

05:57.376 --> 06:00.039
There were three ahead of me.

06:00.179 --> 06:02.162
Three religious men, in fact.

06:02.182 --> 06:13.075
One pastor, Casalis, one Jewish rabbi, Abba Gais, and one Catholic monk or priest, Pater Athanasius.

06:13.775 --> 06:19.162
All these three he came to and asked them to help him become a different man.

06:21.244 --> 06:26.050
And this asking them to become a different man was, in fact, to...

06:26.418 --> 06:28.420
help him seek redemption, if you like.

06:28.880 --> 06:31.283
You know, I'm putting it in these terms, but you know what I mean.

06:31.303 --> 06:32.284
Sure, of course, yeah.

06:32.684 --> 06:37.589
And then it didn't quite work in any of these three cases.

06:37.629 --> 06:40.071
Basically, I mean, I've often asked myself, why?

06:40.992 --> 06:46.317
Because they were all three, you know, far more educated men than I am.

06:47.398 --> 06:49.460
Because they weren't professional writers.

06:50.020 --> 06:50.701
No, they were not.

06:50.721 --> 06:51.562
They couldn't have written it.

06:52.162 --> 06:53.884
But they could do it, you know.

06:54.344 --> 06:55.986
And they were also...

06:56.253 --> 07:06.545
All three, which is very interesting, they, all three, and they were the only ones I have met, all three understood what his need was.

07:07.626 --> 07:24.825
But they couldn't somehow, I don't know whether it was time or whether they simply found each different ways, they found him so complicated that they found different ways of advising him to deal with this problem.

07:25.025 --> 07:40.522
It's interesting that Abba Geis, the Jewish rabbi, which is, I think, amazing, he was the one who finally told him, and he wrote him this too, the letter is in the, forgive yourself, forgive yourself.

07:40.722 --> 07:42.945
You know, do you consider this a biography?

07:43.325 --> 07:44.206
No, I don't.

07:44.386 --> 07:53.496
And perhaps you can distinguish what it is from... Yes, I think it is a... It really is a...

07:53.999 --> 07:58.443
Somebody this morning who was talking to me called it a kind of detective story.

07:58.504 --> 08:00.766
Well, it is a kind of detective story.

08:00.826 --> 08:06.652
It really is an attempt to unravel.

08:06.692 --> 08:22.808
You see, of course the biographical details appear as a result, but it is to unravel this unbelievably complicated personality, and to unravel

08:23.159 --> 08:38.223
this one, what he called himself, to me, the central problem of his life, which was his knowledge, his knowledge of Hitler's horrors, which he could never personally admit to.

08:38.744 --> 08:49.801
He could admit that he, as a member, as he did at NÃ¼rnberg, that he, as a member of Hitler's government, was responsible.

08:49.821 --> 08:50.803
But he could not admit

08:51.239 --> 08:53.803
that he was personally guilty.

08:53.823 --> 08:55.245
He was not culpable.

08:55.285 --> 08:56.848
He was not culpable, that's exactly it.

08:56.868 --> 08:57.529
In his view.

08:57.609 --> 08:58.129
In his view.

08:58.550 --> 09:00.914
And it is a very... You think otherwise, however.

09:01.495 --> 09:03.177
Well, I think he was culpable, of course.

09:03.598 --> 09:07.604
I don't think... Perhaps I should qualify that.

09:07.644 --> 09:19.602
I don't think that he was culpable in the sense of, for instance, being personally guilty, for instance, of the murder of the Jews.

09:19.622 --> 09:20.183
He wasn't.

09:22.424 --> 09:49.680
he had he had simply nothing to do with it you know he was guilty of that as part of the whole thing but he was not personally culpable of it he was personally culpable for the bringing into germany of course and then the treatment of the slave laborers of whom hundreds of thousands died that he was personally culpable of how do you suppose

09:50.065 --> 10:00.921
you point out that given the criteria upon which the others were executed, he then, by applying the same standards, should have gone off to the gallows with them, you feel.

10:01.201 --> 10:02.042
But I think that.

10:02.303 --> 10:03.504
And he thought that.

10:04.326 --> 10:09.573
So do you think that he felt he kind of, he, like O.J.

10:09.593 --> 10:10.474
Simpson, he beat the rap?

10:10.775 --> 10:16.203
No, I thought you were going to say something else, but you almost did and then didn't quite.

10:16.263 --> 10:16.824
And I did.

10:16.844 --> 10:17.044
No.

10:17.945 --> 10:18.486
You see,

10:19.040 --> 10:31.071
In a way, he felt both guilty and, that's really odd, for a while he felt ashamed for not having been executed.

10:31.171 --> 10:32.012
Can you understand that?

10:32.072 --> 10:32.533
Of course.

10:33.353 --> 10:39.799
And that was the time when Pastor Casales met him.

10:39.819 --> 10:43.863
And I was profoundly impressed by this shame.

10:45.104 --> 10:47.967
Well, because I think that there is a kernel of decency in it.

10:48.571 --> 10:51.175
Yes, but you know, it's interesting that you say that.

10:51.255 --> 10:59.027
There was, and yet you see, I mean, there was a kernel of decency from his birth, you know, and from his childhood.

10:59.047 --> 10:59.508
It was there.

10:59.868 --> 11:01.370
I don't know whether you... What makes him interesting.

11:01.411 --> 11:02.793
Yes, indeed, indeed.

11:02.813 --> 11:13.549
I don't know whether you got that far, but, you know, he gave me a whole series of essays he wrote as a young boy and as a student.

11:14.457 --> 11:16.520
And they were absolutely fascinating.

11:16.821 --> 11:23.430
I'm able only to reproduce a little bit of this in them because, you know, it's already much too long.

11:23.450 --> 11:24.532
But I have many more.

11:25.073 --> 11:30.621
And each of these essays is really an exercise in morality.

11:30.641 --> 11:31.502
Isn't that fascinating?

11:32.043 --> 11:35.368
And when I read them, you know, I was dumbfounded.

11:36.209 --> 11:42.659
And I said to him, because I read them while I was with him in the night, you know, I'd read them and the next morning I would talk.

11:43.240 --> 11:43.941
And I said,

11:44.461 --> 11:56.336
How could a man who wrote those essays and showed that kind of morality become as devoid of morality as you became?

11:56.677 --> 11:58.099
And that's the central question, isn't it?

11:58.119 --> 11:58.860
Absolutely.

11:58.880 --> 11:59.721
And what was his response?

11:59.741 --> 12:04.607
Well, his answer was, and you know, he was not avoiding to reply.

12:04.928 --> 12:06.009
He simply didn't know.

12:06.029 --> 12:09.394
He said, well, that is the great mystery, isn't it?

12:09.414 --> 12:10.134
I'm sorry, that's the what?

12:10.515 --> 12:11.596
The great mystery.

12:11.616 --> 12:12.698
The great mystery.

12:12.918 --> 12:14.400
And it is, of course, though...

12:14.633 --> 12:18.737
To me, it only partly remained a mystery.

12:18.757 --> 12:41.198
I mean, I did, I think, understand, and oddly enough, I think with me, he also came to understand that, he didn't like to hear this, but he came to understand that it was this absolutely extraordinary, and a lot of people won't accept this, you know, but it was this absolutely extraordinary love he bore Hitler.

12:41.397 --> 12:50.146
And you maintained that it was certainly not a homoerotic kind of thing.

12:50.166 --> 12:56.572
Well, I agreed actually with Alexander Michalich, who was one of Germany's great psychoanalysts.

12:57.493 --> 13:05.881
Michalich wrote that it had a very strong erotic component, and I think it did, but it was not homosexual.

13:06.502 --> 13:08.704
It was a very German feeling.

13:09.190 --> 13:15.078
I really, I wonder whether, I wonder whether we could find this in many other countries.

13:15.599 --> 13:22.169
The Germans are very romantic, you know, in their hero worship and their affections quite often.

13:22.549 --> 13:38.472
I mean, you find, well, I mean, if you compare it, I don't wish to compare it directly, but if you, you're too young for this, but at a moment, at the time of when I was, when I came to America first, the first time, which was during the war in 42,

13:38.992 --> 13:45.501
there was this incredible adoration of Frank Sinatra.

13:45.521 --> 13:47.764
Now, you know, this was something absolutely extraordinary.

13:47.784 --> 13:54.453
I remember going to a Frank Sinatra concert, telling this for the first time in my life, with Eric Severide.

13:54.493 --> 13:55.855
Do you remember Eric Severide?

13:55.875 --> 13:56.215
Yes, I liked him.

13:56.255 --> 14:04.446
Eric Severide is a great friend of mine, and we went to a concert in Washington, which he gave, and we watched this.

14:04.466 --> 14:06.890
And you know, both of us had the same feeling.

14:07.290 --> 14:07.851
My God.

14:09.046 --> 14:20.784
my God, if this kind of adoration, this kind of charisma effect can affect people this way in America.

14:20.804 --> 14:24.890
You know the potential for other... This was 1942.

14:24.910 --> 14:25.411
This was 1942.

14:25.752 --> 14:28.576
So this was nine years after the arrival of Fitness.

14:28.596 --> 14:29.177
Oh, absolutely.

14:29.197 --> 14:35.847
But I think we both... But you're projecting this from... I'm projecting this, and we felt at the time that...

14:36.164 --> 14:50.321
that this potential, you know, for adoration, and for adoration of, well, I'm not saying he was unworthy, I mean, you know, but... I understand what you're saying, but you're saying that there's this capacity in the human being that is perhaps endemic to the species.

14:50.341 --> 14:56.808
Yes, and that is not, what I was trying to say, and you caught it, was that it is not peculiar to the Germans.

14:56.829 --> 15:04.838
But there is a romantic thing, which is... I've seen these films from the 30s, and for Germans to say we were forced, that's baloney.

15:04.970 --> 15:12.279
You see these crowds of these adoring, nearly mesmerized people, and it's frightening.

15:12.880 --> 15:15.003
It is frightening.

15:15.624 --> 15:16.645
It is frightening.

15:16.705 --> 15:19.088
He's been accused of mass hypnosis.

15:20.590 --> 15:22.853
Well, you know, we laugh about this.

15:23.534 --> 15:27.318
Well, we don't laugh about it, but we don't like thinking that this is possible.

15:27.659 --> 15:32.445
But I must say that having had myself two experiences,

15:32.611 --> 15:35.154
You mentioned that very early in the book.

15:35.174 --> 15:35.875
Of Hitler.

15:35.895 --> 15:37.016
At 12 years old.

15:37.036 --> 15:38.238
Yeah, 11 years old.

15:38.258 --> 15:41.261
I had my first experience of the Nazis.

15:41.501 --> 15:51.213
And, you know, I found myself in NÃ¼rnberg, as a matter of fact, in NÃ¼rnberg, as I described, the NÃ¼rnberg party rally, screaming highly.

15:51.253 --> 15:53.155
I didn't even know what they were screaming.

15:53.195 --> 15:58.601
I was looking at the boy, a young man next to me, to see what it was he was screaming.

15:58.621 --> 16:00.964
And I could see him, you know, shape the world.

16:01.923 --> 16:07.031
And so I followed this, and I also then screamed, heil, heil, heil, you know.

16:07.411 --> 16:08.833
I didn't know why I shouted heil.

16:09.354 --> 16:12.779
I didn't feel any heil, but something happened.

16:12.799 --> 16:15.904
You know, now you can say that this is all gobbledygook.

16:16.545 --> 16:17.766
All right, but it isn't.

16:18.548 --> 16:20.230
Just checking.

16:20.250 --> 16:22.614
I know.

16:22.634 --> 16:23.895
Go ahead, I'm sorry.

16:23.915 --> 16:25.358
No, that was the end of that one.

16:26.419 --> 16:30.165
Is Speer a metaphor for anything in your view?

16:30.185 --> 16:30.685
A metaphor?

16:30.706 --> 16:31.607
You mean a symbol?

16:31.627 --> 16:31.727
Yeah.

16:33.192 --> 16:37.458
Well, I think he's perhaps not a metaphor or a symbol, but he is... I mean, let's go beyond.

16:37.478 --> 16:38.820
He's a case study of something.

16:39.141 --> 17:01.174
Yes, to me, he's ultra-important in the sense... Well, he's ultra-important in many ways, but he's ultra-important to me in the sense that if it can happen, you know, to a man as intelligent as that, to a man, as I say, in this of excellence, which he was...

17:01.441 --> 17:05.487
To this degree, he can become corrupted to this degree.

17:05.987 --> 17:10.233
He can become devoid of morality.

17:10.313 --> 17:14.499
As I call it, his morality is extinguished in him.

17:14.519 --> 17:24.053
If this can happen to a man as excellent as that, then I think the danger of it all should be very, very clear to us.

17:24.153 --> 17:25.575
So it's a cautionary tale?

17:26.516 --> 17:28.579
It is a cautionary tale in a way.

17:28.964 --> 17:30.246
I mean, I didn't think of it.

17:30.306 --> 17:31.768
You were saying this for the first time.

17:31.788 --> 17:34.091
I mean, I didn't think of this, but why not?

17:34.131 --> 17:35.152
There's a question mark at the end.

17:35.172 --> 17:35.733
Why not?

17:35.753 --> 17:36.334
But why not?

17:36.634 --> 17:38.196
Yes, it is a cautionary tale.

17:38.717 --> 17:57.402
Certainly there were moments, there were moments, you know, while I was with him, and as you know, I was with him not only the first time for three weeks, but a number of times afterwards until he died, when I found him quite frightening.

17:58.478 --> 18:00.301
Just momentarily.

18:00.321 --> 18:02.744
He would let himself go and then he would catch himself.

18:02.985 --> 18:03.866
That's absolutely right.

18:03.886 --> 18:07.271
There were those moments, however, when you said, my God.

18:07.671 --> 18:09.234
Yeah, there were those moments.

18:09.394 --> 18:10.716
There were not many of those.

18:10.756 --> 18:11.978
But one is enough.

18:12.018 --> 18:13.139
Well, there were several.

18:13.780 --> 18:27.540
But by the same token, to be fair, there were those other moments when subjects came up which were related to this question of guilt.

18:28.027 --> 18:33.195
and this question of knowledge, and I saw him change.

18:34.437 --> 18:35.799
I saw his body change.

18:36.240 --> 18:44.252
You know, people can lie in words, but body language is something else, and you cannot lie with your body.

18:45.133 --> 18:55.249
When you start to sweat, and when your muscles begin to go flaccid, and when you face your comparatively young face, which he had,

18:55.921 --> 18:59.226
and strong face turns into an old face.

18:59.967 --> 19:01.049
That you cannot fake.

19:01.810 --> 19:07.159
And I saw this on perhaps only two or three occasions.

19:07.359 --> 19:08.741
It was quite enough.

19:08.761 --> 19:13.769
There was a novel published in England a couple of years ago, which I really liked, the Fatherland novel.

19:14.090 --> 19:15.071
Oh, yes.

19:15.272 --> 19:15.632
By Harris.

19:15.752 --> 19:16.333
Robert Harris.

19:16.353 --> 19:17.535
I mean, it was a what if.

19:17.555 --> 19:18.737
It was quite a what if.

19:18.757 --> 19:19.138
Yeah.

19:19.158 --> 19:23.785
But to take the what if a bit further, what if, you know, Germany

19:24.136 --> 19:26.318
as Hitler and Hitler had survived.

19:26.939 --> 19:28.280
And he was very close to it.

19:28.420 --> 19:34.487
Well, how do you suppose Speer would have... He would not have felt one bit of that guilt.

19:35.147 --> 19:37.149
So he'd have been a totally different person.

19:37.169 --> 19:42.795
He would have remained the person he had become under Hitler.

19:42.815 --> 19:44.937
I have no illusions about that whatsoever.

19:45.518 --> 19:52.725
That does not mean, because I can hear those cynics say immediately, aha, she's admitting that,

19:53.026 --> 19:59.493
She's therefore admitting that he was being pragmatic with his guilt feelings.

19:59.513 --> 19:59.753
No.

20:00.714 --> 20:01.415
No, you see?

20:01.455 --> 20:14.188
I think we must see people, and this is something that I'm trying to get across both here and already did in my book, Into That Darkness, about Shtanga.

20:14.909 --> 20:21.396
I think we have to look at people during each period of their lives

20:21.680 --> 20:24.765
within the context of the circumstances in which they live.

20:25.466 --> 20:27.489
It is pointless not to, you know.

20:27.849 --> 20:31.835
I mean, for instance, let us take a terrible scenario.

20:31.855 --> 20:37.524
Let us take the scenario that America would become a country.

20:37.584 --> 20:42.291
I'm now dreaming a fatherland, a horrible, horrible fatherland dream.

20:42.692 --> 20:49.662
Let us imagine that America would become a country in which whites were no longer tolerated.

20:51.700 --> 20:57.729
This is, you know, it is a nightmare, but it is an impossible nightmare.

20:58.410 --> 21:01.555
Especially since we outnumber the whites outnumber the others.

21:01.575 --> 21:03.758
Yes, but let us just imagine this.

21:06.943 --> 21:07.363
Kafkaesque.

21:07.383 --> 21:08.685
Kafkaesque, exactly.

21:09.246 --> 21:19.902
If we imagine this, I assure you that the behavior of every single person, you, me, anyone, would become different.

21:20.371 --> 21:27.478
to the behavior these same people, us, demonstrated for years before.

21:28.318 --> 21:48.437
And this applies, for instance, extremely strongly and gave me many sleepless nights to the extermination camps, where people who had been the most honorable, the most, you know, people with greatest integrity and morality and

21:48.755 --> 22:01.212
honesty, and you name it, generosity, in order to remain alive, they had to become different.

22:01.232 --> 22:07.860
You know, it is something which is extremely difficult for people to assimilate, because we don't want to think of this.

22:08.361 --> 22:16.652
But you see, it is true that circumstances do affect the conduct of people in an

22:16.919 --> 22:19.642
in a very, very extraordinary way.

22:20.043 --> 22:28.534
This is no excuse for anybody, and no accusation either for anybody, but it's a fact, and maybe we don't consider it enough.

22:28.614 --> 22:33.420
Did you emerge for... How many hours do you feel you spent with such a period?

22:33.440 --> 22:35.843
Well, I... I mean, actually interviewing them.

22:36.164 --> 22:38.827
Yes, because I don't call them interviews, you see.

22:38.847 --> 22:43.433
We had a talking relationship.

22:43.818 --> 22:45.981
which, as you know, he saw.

22:46.001 --> 22:47.983
Well, you might distinguish that from me now.

22:48.003 --> 22:49.385
Why don't you follow interviews?

22:49.405 --> 22:53.590
Because an interview is where you ask questions and you get answers.

22:53.790 --> 22:56.133
Or you don't get answers.

22:56.313 --> 23:00.478
A dialogue is something else.

23:00.798 --> 23:02.640
But it was a journalistic exercise.

23:02.840 --> 23:10.129
It was a journalistic exercise in the sense that he always knew that whatever he answered or whatever we talked about

23:10.379 --> 23:11.500
would see print.

23:11.761 --> 23:13.403
In that sense.

23:13.924 --> 23:14.304
Absolutely.

23:14.324 --> 23:15.586
In that sense, it's true.

23:15.906 --> 23:19.230
That was part of the tacit understanding between the two?

23:19.511 --> 23:19.951
Absolutely.

23:19.991 --> 23:33.970
I mean, I told him this from the word go, A, to remind him that this would happen, and B, I also told him from the word go, as I always do to whoever I speak to, what my own feelings were, in this case, toward him.

23:34.630 --> 23:38.175
And I told him that I did not believe his mere corpus,

23:38.847 --> 23:50.217
that I did not like his arrogance, that I thought he was extremely self-centered, and that I had in fact never liked him very much.

23:51.679 --> 24:08.314
And that I would try to, whether I would go to like him or not, I didn't know, but that I would try to break through this wall he had erected of whatever it was.

24:08.497 --> 24:10.940
And on that basis, we began to work together.

24:11.201 --> 24:14.065
So you see, this is not really interviews in the sense of terms of that.

24:14.085 --> 24:15.687
OK, but you spent a lot of time with them.

24:15.707 --> 24:17.489
Yeah, I spent, you said how many hours.

24:17.670 --> 24:19.272
Well, I'm just... That's almost impossible.

24:19.292 --> 24:20.834
I mean, certainly many hundreds.

24:20.854 --> 24:21.575
But there was a point.

24:21.595 --> 24:29.326
There was not just a number, but I guess what I'm interested in knowing is at what point did you really feel you had a sense of him?

24:29.346 --> 24:32.751
Well, after the first three weeks... And that you really had the substance to put it in the book.

24:32.771 --> 24:33.031
Yeah, yeah.

24:33.051 --> 24:34.233
Absolutely, that's a good question.

24:34.253 --> 24:38.098
I mean, after the first three weeks we spent together, where I...

24:38.348 --> 24:39.469
except to go to sleep.

24:39.569 --> 24:40.330
I never left him.

24:41.211 --> 24:45.495
You see, I stayed with him too for two of these three years.

24:45.515 --> 24:46.816
Was there anxiety for you?

24:46.836 --> 24:48.798
Was there a sense that I still don't have it?

24:49.118 --> 24:53.022
Not even knowing what it is, but... No.

24:53.262 --> 25:04.693
I had this sense of anxiety slightly more with Stange, years before, where I was trying to get something much more... You know, much more... Yes, exactly.

25:04.943 --> 25:06.305
I don't need to put words in there.

25:06.325 --> 25:08.467
No, but I mean, that's right.

25:08.647 --> 25:09.468
You sense it right.

25:09.989 --> 25:16.937
With Speyer, I did not have this anxiety, I tell you, because... I'll tell you something funny.

25:17.678 --> 25:31.795
Well, not funny, but... With Speyer, as of, say, the fourth or fifth day we had spent together, I began to feel that I was... Whether I got...

25:32.028 --> 25:37.496
got to the kernel of his problem, which was his knowledge and his sense of guilt.

25:37.516 --> 25:46.729
Whether or not I got that, I realized after about four or five days that this man had an awful lot to teach me.

25:47.170 --> 25:49.613
You know, to teach me.

25:50.635 --> 25:59.267
From the moment when he really started to talk, I thought, well, I'm sort of convinced, you know, very, very honestly, and we

25:59.905 --> 26:10.135
we delved much further into his relationship with Hitler and his own analysis of Hitler.

26:10.355 --> 26:11.657
I knew that I would get on.

26:11.677 --> 26:15.580
When you asked me, was it a biography, I didn't finish my reply.

26:15.620 --> 26:20.425
You see, this book is as much about Hitler as it is about Speer, almost.

26:20.946 --> 26:27.432
Of course, not really as much, but it tries as much to understand Hitler

26:27.935 --> 26:30.277
as it does try to understand Speer.

26:30.297 --> 26:32.239
Well, Hitler's up here, and he's not around.

26:32.499 --> 26:34.721
But to get there, I think we have to use him.

26:35.342 --> 26:38.504
Yes, it's even slightly different than that.

26:38.865 --> 26:44.890
See, I don't think you can understand Speer without understanding the relationship between him and Hitler.

26:44.910 --> 26:56.440
And I don't think you can quite understand Hitler without realizing that he was in need, I'm not saying capable of, in need of the relationship

26:56.791 --> 26:57.912
that he had this bear.

26:58.673 --> 27:04.722
I think that that is extremely interesting and has given us a lot, a lot of new understanding.

27:04.762 --> 27:10.509
At least that is why historian friends who have worked on Hitler and have read this, they feel this.

27:11.030 --> 27:17.679
Alan Bullock felt this very strongly, that this gives us a completely new understanding of the Nazi mind.

27:19.802 --> 27:26.190
Did you come away from this with, what for you is the unanswered question?

27:27.571 --> 27:33.699
What did he fail to give you, either directly or indirectly?

27:33.719 --> 27:39.147
I think the only really unanswered question is the one that he called the great mystery.

27:40.088 --> 27:45.936
You know, how it could, how love can corrupt man.

27:46.697 --> 27:48.219
That is the unanswered question.

27:48.539 --> 27:51.143
I'm not so sure that we will ever find an answer for this.

27:51.623 --> 27:56.650
But he did not fail to give me any other answer I was seeking.

27:57.085 --> 28:00.209
including his guilt.

28:00.229 --> 28:00.849
You know, it's interesting.

28:00.910 --> 28:05.395
I'm looking at the book as we sit here, and I see that it's tight, and it's black and white.

28:06.376 --> 28:08.378
And it's black on white.

28:08.599 --> 28:10.121
There are no gray shadings there.

28:10.621 --> 28:18.030
And do you find, to just take this into the book and the subject, do you find any gray shadings

28:18.213 --> 28:43.310
any halftones with this man, or is it... Well, I... You're putting this... I mean, you're saying... You're asking a question which, you know, is one of the practically main themes of every talk I have given over the last five weeks in five countries, that one of the important things to remember is that no one is black or white.

28:43.951 --> 28:46.735
That this gray, the gray shading, as you call it,

28:47.035 --> 28:51.319
The grey is actually the principal part of us all.

28:52.280 --> 28:58.786
And unless we are able... You see, with a man like Speer... Sorry to come back upon myself.

28:59.006 --> 29:11.797
With a man like Speer, most people... There were exceptions, but most people who talked to him, or tried to talk to him, they could only address the white or the black.

29:12.518 --> 29:14.680
The black being the Speer under Hitler,

29:14.997 --> 29:25.687
the white being the man who had written these two books, I'm not speaking of his last books because it was so terrible, but these two books, inside the Third Reich and Spandau, Spandau's Secret Diaries.

29:26.207 --> 29:31.392
Now, they were addressing these two facets of this personality.

29:31.432 --> 29:43.603
What they didn't address at all is the person in between, and the person in between really was much more interesting.

29:44.225 --> 29:54.880
because the person in between was the one who was trying to wrestle with both with what he had been and what he had become.

29:56.663 --> 29:58.486
And that was the most interesting part.

29:58.546 --> 30:10.063
I think you already addressed yourself to this question in anticipation of it, but I have it on my notes to understand the mystery of Hitler as, of course, to perhaps harness about that.

30:10.483 --> 30:11.785
I was just wondering,

30:12.153 --> 30:15.698
Speer, I guess I'm... Speer, no, you're doing very well, yeah.

30:15.718 --> 30:27.293
Is he, for you, a kind of Rosetta Stone by which you can... Well, Speer, I mean.

30:27.313 --> 30:35.164
Well, I don't know that I can say that, but I think that you were just asking, you were just bringing up the mystery of Hitler.

30:35.184 --> 30:38.308
Well, I haven't really covered that.

30:38.328 --> 30:40.050
I mean, the mystery of Hitler is, of course,

30:40.267 --> 31:06.706
No, there is a point there which would be worth mentioning, which is, you know, I am an enormous believer, I don't know whether you've read my books, my various books, but I've written two books on very unhappy children, which is my other area of so-called expertise, and by working with these children, some of whom had killed other children.

31:07.387 --> 31:09.430
What a depressing story.

31:09.764 --> 31:11.566
It's very, very interesting.

31:11.746 --> 31:17.331
And others who have become child prostitutes because of the chaos in their lives, you know.

31:18.112 --> 31:26.499
I have come to absolutely believe, and I am convinced of this, that all children are born good, you know.

31:28.281 --> 31:30.143
All human beings are born good.

31:31.163 --> 31:32.224
And then something happens.

31:32.264 --> 31:38.370
But, then there comes something, someone like Hitler.

31:39.565 --> 32:02.856
thank god there aren't many like that but it it defies my belief you know because we we don't know you know nobody knows you you realize that that nobody has ever been able to probe hitler's childhood not beyond a certain point i mean they know that he had a stepfather who who beat him but

32:03.663 --> 32:04.925
Other children have been beaten.

32:05.285 --> 32:06.607
So what's missing?

32:06.627 --> 32:07.108
Documents?

32:07.148 --> 32:16.140
People who... Nobody ever tried early enough because, of course, early enough would have been during Hitler's time because he was not young enough, you see.

32:16.461 --> 32:18.704
He was not that old when he died, though, was he?

32:18.984 --> 32:20.606
Well, he was... What was he?

32:20.626 --> 32:22.629
I can't remember his age when he died.

32:23.831 --> 32:27.115
But he was already in his 50s when he came to power.

32:27.936 --> 32:29.859
Was he in his 50s?

32:29.939 --> 32:30.780
Yes, he was 40.

32:31.241 --> 32:32.202
Late 40s, anyway.

32:32.468 --> 32:37.233
When he came to Parliament, of course, nobody dared then to investigate his childhood.

32:37.253 --> 32:38.013
You can imagine.

32:38.053 --> 32:38.994
That's a great parallel.

32:39.074 --> 32:40.596
My God, what it would have been.

32:40.976 --> 32:42.358
So nobody did.

32:42.398 --> 32:51.807
And the result, sadly enough, is that no one has seen any of the witnesses of his childhood.

32:51.827 --> 32:53.809
So we don't know what he was like as a child.

32:53.829 --> 32:54.549
That would be fascinating.

32:54.689 --> 32:56.291
Oh, God, wouldn't it be.

32:56.311 --> 33:00.535
Oh, I would have given my eye teeth to have done that, really.

33:00.886 --> 33:02.428
But it didn't happen.

33:02.889 --> 33:07.816
And so, as a result, we are faced with this man who really was evil, you know.

33:07.836 --> 33:17.851
I mean, it is very difficult for me to admit that a person is evil, you know, because it's very difficult.

33:18.812 --> 33:21.856
I don't believe in original sin.

33:21.876 --> 33:22.517
Intrinsically evil.

33:22.577 --> 33:23.519
Intrinsically evil.

33:23.579 --> 33:29.948
I mean, I can take, for instance, I don't know, I can take a serial murderer,

33:30.907 --> 33:46.205
And I can find, not reasons for his, not reasons for his killings, but I can find reasons, if I look, and I have of course found, reasons for the way he developed and for his pathology.

33:47.146 --> 33:50.671
You know, but for Hitler, who seemed to be made of hate.

33:51.992 --> 33:57.859
I don't mean, I don't mean, quote, only, unquote, only for the Jews or against the Jews.

33:58.420 --> 33:59.361
He had hate.

33:59.763 --> 34:01.165
for so many things.

34:01.225 --> 34:12.780
I'm of Greek extraction, and Greeks were... Well, I mean, he didn't exactly admire... Well, he admired Greek civilization, I think.

34:12.800 --> 34:13.480
Well, the ancients.

34:13.601 --> 34:15.263
Yeah, the ancients, exactly.

34:15.283 --> 34:24.374
But he didn't... I mean, but above all, you see, he hated all Slavs, and certainly intended to decimate all... He respected the English for some reason.

34:24.394 --> 34:26.036
Yes, he loved the English.

34:26.056 --> 34:28.660
Isn't that extraordinary?

34:28.680 --> 34:28.960
Weird.

34:29.142 --> 34:32.827
But, no, to come back to this, this was a man filled with hate.

34:33.848 --> 34:37.233
How did this hate, where did it come from?

34:37.934 --> 34:46.745
And, you know, there I am tempted to feel that I have to go against my own faith in good.

34:47.586 --> 34:49.849
Do you think the answer is to be found in his youth?

34:51.151 --> 34:51.952
I'm afraid so.

34:52.072 --> 34:53.915
You know, I hate to say this.

34:54.035 --> 34:58.120
I mean, I'm saying it to you, and of course you can use it, but I will add that I...

34:58.420 --> 35:00.884
I am deadly afraid of psychobabble.

35:01.785 --> 35:02.987
I really am scared of it.

35:03.428 --> 35:08.215
So I'm very... And you really... And I don't sense it in here, by the way, thank goodness.

35:08.235 --> 35:09.557
No, I was very careful.

35:09.737 --> 35:15.827
And I should imagine it'd be a sitting duck for somebody who has the... Yeah, yeah, yes.

35:15.867 --> 35:19.833
The mindset to do a psycho... Yeah, I know.

35:19.953 --> 35:23.979
And I mean, for instance, you... Well, I must say that.

35:23.999 --> 35:25.221
The books that have been written...

35:25.454 --> 35:36.326
But about Hitler, too, one could so easily, you know, invent psychobabble, but really, I mean, so many things have been said, so many nonsensous things.

35:36.346 --> 35:43.234
I mean, who cares whether he had one testicle or two testicles, you know, I mean, what the hell does it matter, you know, and all these things.

35:43.254 --> 35:44.676
Well, isn't your show like pigsty?

35:44.696 --> 35:47.780
No, I mean, really, really, I ask you.

35:47.800 --> 35:49.481
I mean, if you want to go to that experience.

35:49.542 --> 35:50.563
Isn't it absurd?

35:50.883 --> 35:52.245
So that really isn't it.

35:52.365 --> 35:54.347
But I think the, you know, there is,

35:54.547 --> 36:08.603
There is yet a field for discovery, and we won't be able to do it with Hitler, but perhaps we can do it with someone else to discover the real origin of evil in a human being.

36:08.623 --> 36:09.123
It's wonderful.

36:09.383 --> 36:10.385
It's a wonderful thing.

36:10.425 --> 36:12.187
It's what I'm looking for, you see.

36:12.727 --> 36:16.331
And so this, in a way, does fit in with your previous work, doesn't it?

36:16.351 --> 36:17.613
It fits in, but it's not.

36:17.793 --> 36:24.300
You see, I always say this, that, of course, Speer was not an evil man.

36:25.478 --> 36:27.661
He said he allowed himself to be seduced.

36:27.761 --> 36:29.022
He became monstrous.

36:29.102 --> 36:32.707
I mean, the things that he knew... Well, that's a good quote, but he became monstrous.

36:32.947 --> 36:33.948
He became monstrous.

36:34.329 --> 36:44.221
He became monstrous because he allowed himself to remain within the monstrosity.

36:44.321 --> 36:48.886
And what he denies is his cognizance in the fact that he became monstrous.

36:49.207 --> 36:51.389
Well, no, what he denied... Do you think he did it mindfully?

36:52.731 --> 36:53.011
What?

36:53.192 --> 36:55.114
Did he mindfully become monstrous?

36:55.263 --> 36:58.207
Was he aware of what was becoming?

36:58.287 --> 37:00.511
No, you see, you're absolutely right.

37:00.551 --> 37:04.336
I mean, your question is quite right, because he didn't.

37:04.857 --> 37:13.910
I mean, for instance, I confronted him not once, but perhaps, I don't know, 10, 15 times, time and again, because I kept coming back.

37:14.211 --> 37:16.894
In the book, you will see that I keep coming back to things.

37:16.915 --> 37:23.464
Now, some not so clever reviewers, they've all been wonderful to me, but some of them,

37:24.085 --> 37:27.369
not so clever, say, oh, well, she does repeat herself.

37:27.389 --> 37:38.602
But the only way to get to the, you know, to the depth of these people is to go back and back and back and start again and hope that they will put it differently.

37:38.642 --> 37:39.843
Do you understand?

37:39.863 --> 37:43.988
I just had a book of my own published and it's had some wonderful reviews.

37:44.048 --> 37:44.669
What is it?

37:45.009 --> 37:46.491
It's a book on bibliomania.

37:46.511 --> 37:50.035
It's called Gentle Madness and it's about 2,500 years.

37:50.055 --> 37:50.655
It's wonderful.

37:50.675 --> 37:51.917
What a wonderful title.

37:51.937 --> 37:53.839
It's an interesting subject and...

37:54.173 --> 37:58.617
the reviewer for the New York Times did a full-page review in the New York Times, and he said it's repetitious.

37:59.038 --> 38:01.540
Well, obviously, if you're trying to trace something through... Well, there you are.

38:01.580 --> 38:02.361
There you are.

38:02.541 --> 38:08.527
He said he tends to be repetitious on the one hand, but then he also says he wishes there were other things that I did, you know?

38:08.547 --> 38:09.908
Yeah, yeah.

38:09.948 --> 38:11.049
You can't satisfy them.

38:11.089 --> 38:11.670
No, you can't.

38:11.730 --> 38:15.313
You can't win entirely because they... You know why?

38:15.713 --> 38:20.738
Because most people have very simple minds.

38:20.758 --> 38:22.780
I mean, even extremely intelligent people.

38:23.063 --> 38:29.877
And they are spoiled by a sort of, well, a media thing.

38:30.137 --> 38:41.280
It isn't just the media, but it's also now a certain kind of book, and also certainly academic books, which always go from one, you know, they're very sequential.

38:41.600 --> 38:42.342
And simplistic.

38:42.582 --> 38:44.025
Very simplistic.

38:44.630 --> 38:46.153
compared to the speaking, not all.

38:46.774 --> 38:55.952
But I think the kinds of books you're describing... Yes, but I mean, for instance, a book by Alan Bullock, like, you know, Stalin and Hitler, parallel, you know, one.

38:56.113 --> 38:58.437
I thought it had its weaknesses, though.

38:58.497 --> 39:00.802
That was pretty good, then.

39:01.002 --> 39:01.744
Did you?

39:01.764 --> 39:02.445
Yeah, that was pretty good.

39:02.525 --> 39:03.567
I love that.

39:03.888 --> 39:06.553
I think there are some... But the measure is, I have the book.

39:06.685 --> 39:07.886
Yeah, the book.

39:07.906 --> 39:08.587
I've kept it.

39:08.607 --> 39:09.288
Exactly, exactly.

39:09.629 --> 39:34.819
But on the whole, people look at things, you know, very simply, and they say, well, we must go from one thing to another, and you must not repeat, and they don't understand that if you're going to understand anything like you with your, you know, your bibliominia, and I with my trying to delve into these absolutely horribly difficult to be delved into personalities, you have to keep going back.

39:35.474 --> 39:37.217
There is another thing.

39:38.699 --> 39:42.785
You see, you could go back and not tell your reader you have gone back.

39:44.347 --> 39:52.660
That is if you don't believe in the capacity of your reader to read.

39:52.700 --> 39:59.430
Now, I have a great belief in the capacity of the reader to read and to understand.

39:59.510 --> 40:00.371
But not every reader.

40:00.972 --> 40:01.754
Not every reader.

40:01.794 --> 40:04.097
The people who read this book have the capacity to read.

40:04.752 --> 40:06.715
but this book is not for every reader.

40:07.175 --> 40:07.636
I don't know.

40:07.656 --> 40:09.879
I think it's for far more readers than we think.

40:10.480 --> 40:32.329
You see, I think that if you and I write, and I have an idea you probably do, I don't know, but I haven't read it, but from the way you speak, if we write understandably rather than pretentiously or highfalutinely, if we write like we speak,

40:33.423 --> 40:40.752
And if we write humanly, rather than academically, people will be able to follow it.

40:40.812 --> 40:46.339
There are things they will perhaps, you know, where it's very thick paragraphs, they might jump.

40:46.599 --> 40:51.906
I have to tell you, Kate, I was interviewed by this person, Brian Lamb, for C-SPAN.

40:51.986 --> 40:52.326
Yes.

40:53.167 --> 40:54.329
But he's very good.

40:54.349 --> 40:56.091
And I'm on this Sunday night, if you happen to see.

40:56.111 --> 40:56.571
Oh, really?

40:56.631 --> 40:57.633
Oh, hell, I'll be gone.

40:57.693 --> 40:58.574
I'll be in the front foot.

40:58.594 --> 41:01.978
Well, if he asked me a question, I'd certainly be this on tape about that.

41:06.548 --> 41:13.884
You know, I'm absolutely amazed what is happening to this book in England, and in Germany, and in Holland.

41:14.405 --> 41:18.954
I mean, in Holland, it became a bestseller in one week.

41:19.516 --> 41:25.789
In England, it's been on the bestseller list for four weeks.

41:25.904 --> 41:28.948
But what is interesting is how many young people are buying it.

41:29.309 --> 41:30.030
You know, it's expensive.

41:30.050 --> 41:31.452
Well, that's encouraging, isn't it?

41:31.492 --> 41:32.213
Isn't it encouraging?

41:32.233 --> 41:32.954
Yeah, that really is.

41:33.054 --> 41:33.795
I think so.

41:33.815 --> 41:36.279
Because people are trying to deny that... That's right.

41:36.399 --> 41:47.154
Last night I was invited to a dinner party here in Boston, and there was a very learned man, a very learned professor, and he told me that the young don't read.

41:48.175 --> 41:48.536
It's true.

41:49.177 --> 41:49.757
Well, I don't know.

41:49.918 --> 41:50.899
But my daughters read.

41:51.149 --> 41:53.372
And they read all the time.

41:53.472 --> 41:54.774
People say the young don't read.

41:54.975 --> 41:56.036
You say it's true.

41:56.197 --> 41:57.779
The next thing you say, your daughter reads.

41:58.220 --> 42:02.166
I can't tell you how many daughters and sons read who I know.

42:02.206 --> 42:06.091
And they're not people I know intimately, but I know all of them.

42:06.492 --> 42:15.165
And in England, where I went around speaking, just like I do here, in these bookstores, these kids came up.

42:15.398 --> 42:17.039
and asked me to sign the book.

42:17.220 --> 42:19.562
And I'd say, but my goodness, how can you pay for this?

42:19.582 --> 42:24.406
When a kid comes up to me and asks to sign the book, I stop, and I talk to the kid.

42:24.426 --> 42:24.827
Me too.

42:24.847 --> 42:27.209
And I want to write something nice in there, and I thank them.

42:27.229 --> 42:27.429
Me too.

42:27.589 --> 42:29.951
I wish them the best, and I want it all in the book.

42:30.232 --> 42:32.614
I have to run before I get a ticket.

42:32.774 --> 42:35.576
Just tell me briefly what you're working on next.

42:36.397 --> 42:37.118
Well, I don't know.

42:37.798 --> 42:39.340
I have to get over this book now.

42:39.940 --> 42:41.662
It takes some getting over.

42:41.702 --> 42:42.823
And after all, you know,

42:43.090 --> 42:44.793
It's being published in eight countries.

42:44.853 --> 42:47.578
I mean, I have to go from country to country.

42:47.598 --> 42:49.681
And I love the fact that you didn't compromise on it.

42:49.721 --> 42:50.282
It's all there.

42:50.703 --> 42:51.604
My book is 638 pages.

42:51.624 --> 42:52.546
There you are.

42:52.786 --> 42:56.953
And mine is a $35 book, as this is a $35 book.

42:57.054 --> 42:58.756
Well, we have something in common, haven't we?

42:58.776 --> 43:00.559
You would kindly inscribe this for me.

43:00.620 --> 43:01.080
Absolutely.

43:01.120 --> 43:02.242
Now, have we got a pen?

43:02.262 --> 43:06.870
I've got a pen.
