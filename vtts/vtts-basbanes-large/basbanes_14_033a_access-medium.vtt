WEBVTT

00:02.056 --> 00:13.374
is there still, because he's saying that the Swedish bottle is better than the Russian one, and the absolute corporation says that you were.

00:13.394 --> 00:22.949
So now I am speculating about mentioning every article in a different kind of liquor.

00:22.969 --> 00:25.112
Thank you so much for agreeing to see us.

00:26.654 --> 00:28.958
We're working on a new book, and...

00:29.596 --> 00:33.141
and I think I mentioned to you some of the points that we're working on.

00:33.621 --> 00:35.564
First of all, your house is like a museum.

00:35.964 --> 00:39.870
You collect seashells, and I see books on exhibition.

00:39.890 --> 00:46.198
I have my room with ashen books, and then you look at it.

00:46.498 --> 00:57.493
The window is done only... First, we needed a sort of separation inside the window, because it's a way to...

00:57.743 --> 00:59.545
look at the book.

00:59.765 --> 01:03.049
So every 15 days I change the subject.

01:03.069 --> 01:04.770
Really?

01:04.790 --> 01:11.097
And do you change them by volume or do you make like an exhibition of related movies?

01:11.117 --> 01:17.263
It can be island or alchemy or single author.

01:19.245 --> 01:22.689
So books for you are to look at as objects.

01:22.949 --> 01:23.249
Yes.

01:23.370 --> 01:25.692
Now we did an interview yesterday with

01:26.262 --> 01:31.807
Mr. Carlo Chiesa, and he said, are you going to see Umberto Eco?

01:31.867 --> 01:32.528
And I said, yes.

01:32.568 --> 01:35.270
He said, this is a man who collects for knowledge.

01:36.151 --> 01:36.871
It's very interesting.

01:36.891 --> 01:37.892
Would you agree with that?

01:38.793 --> 01:47.541
Well, I mean, I'm not of those collectors that keep the book closed and secret in order to not damage it.

01:47.561 --> 01:54.447
I know that leaving then open for 15 days or more is not so good, but

01:54.747 --> 01:55.348
Okay.

01:55.729 --> 01:56.109
Okay.

01:56.129 --> 01:58.473
Why not?

01:59.815 --> 02:01.818
But are these particularly real?

02:02.199 --> 02:02.980
What?

02:03.000 --> 02:05.444
You're a native and you're an American.

02:05.905 --> 02:06.145
What?

02:06.465 --> 02:10.131
Can I smell?

02:10.151 --> 02:10.572
Really?

02:12.976 --> 02:15.920
This is... We're fine.

02:17.463 --> 02:17.683
Um...

02:20.650 --> 02:25.397
But I'm curious about, do you have a focus in your collecting subject?

02:25.417 --> 02:25.677
Yes.

02:25.897 --> 02:39.717
The title of my collection, if you have time, is Biblioteca Seriologica Curiosa Lunatica Magica Traumatica.

02:39.737 --> 02:39.997
Wow.

02:42.220 --> 02:44.143
Could you say that just a little bit slower?

02:44.183 --> 02:45.305
Maybe you can write it down for me.

02:45.325 --> 02:45.465
No.

02:46.707 --> 02:50.472
Is there some paraby of other titles

03:07.175 --> 03:28.980
curiosa, curiosities.

03:29.669 --> 03:41.708
Mine is semi-logical, because it concerns signs, symbols, strange languages, emblems, and so on.

03:41.728 --> 03:43.931
Curiosa, because it might be curious.

03:43.951 --> 03:54.107
Lunatic, because I don't collect serious signs, but only false signs.

03:54.526 --> 04:04.077
with these kabbalistic, alchemic, that explains magic and magic and so on.

04:04.097 --> 04:09.123
Now, a lot of these books are books that you could probably find in libraries, if you wanted.

04:09.604 --> 04:12.648
Is it necessary for you to own them, to write about them?

04:13.268 --> 04:17.533
What is the difference for you to have a book?

04:18.815 --> 04:23.200
Now, speaking of rare books, because

04:24.344 --> 04:27.008
speak of the new one is another problem now.

04:27.028 --> 04:27.248
Yes.

04:27.328 --> 04:28.950
You need it yourself.

04:30.272 --> 04:52.562
Well, I started pretty late in my life to collect rare books, more or less after the publication in 1980 of The Name of the Road.

04:53.268 --> 04:54.550
for a very simple reason.

04:54.650 --> 04:58.235
First, I had more money.

04:58.255 --> 05:14.719
Second, I said, since I got money because of a book, it means to me moral and correct to use it for books instead that for drugs or something else.

05:15.279 --> 05:22.009
Then I discovered that probably I knew the matter already.

05:22.681 --> 05:27.886
It was not so difficult to enter the domain into this column.

05:28.466 --> 05:41.719
Yes, before it happened to be some time to buy an old book, but to write that it was not expensive and very, very rare.

05:41.739 --> 05:49.026
So, I had a lot of time

05:49.580 --> 05:55.045
interesting on this field.

05:55.065 --> 06:03.533
But then I was encouraged to buy certain books also because of something that I was writing.

06:03.553 --> 06:18.608
For instance, I was running Foucault's pendulum with all this universe linked to occult science and so I was encouraged to look for certain books.

06:18.925 --> 06:25.155
years ago I made a long time to study on the quest for the perfect language.

06:25.395 --> 06:25.776
Yes.

06:26.817 --> 06:46.688
And at that time I was interested in having, I don't know, wakings or so-and-so people who had invented those magical or informational languages and they have a good, some shells to

06:47.444 --> 06:59.739
are not so bad in this field which is such an arcane field that there are few people looking for this kind of white alchemy and things like so.

06:59.779 --> 07:08.149
They are very popular and a lot of collectors are looking for them.

07:08.169 --> 07:12.895
Strange and invented languages is a very restrictive thing which I think

07:13.567 --> 07:19.013
I can maneuver with a certain knowledge.

07:19.433 --> 07:41.717
Chris, that's your... So it happened that when writing the last novel, even though this had nothing to do with my collection, but I both sort of think of geography, navigation, but at the same time, you know, the problem of longitude, so I got something.

07:41.737 --> 07:41.937
Okay.

07:42.878 --> 07:50.368
So I tried to speak to my subject matter, but without being so dogmatic.

07:50.428 --> 08:02.124
For instance, at a certain point, I wanted to have an incunabulum of the Divine Comedy, or the first edition of Manzoni from Messismo.

08:02.264 --> 08:10.836
I don't belong to the collection, but it's a pleasure to have some... Do you have an incunabulum of the Divine Comedy?

08:10.896 --> 08:12.278
Yes, not the first one.

08:12.663 --> 08:16.427
Well, but an old, is it an oldie?

08:16.447 --> 08:18.870
No, no, not an oldie.

08:18.890 --> 08:23.695
So once I found a marble in Cenabulum of St.

08:23.715 --> 08:39.312
Agosti, rubricated from the beginning to the end, a very crisp end, really not expensive, and okay, I bought it, because now it's the book I prefer, it's the most beautiful of my

08:39.865 --> 08:56.504
Not the most rare or the most expensive, but in any case, the one I love more, just as an object also to start and show you from the start of radical political views, full of inventions.

08:56.524 --> 09:01.150
I hope it's at some point when we're done you can show us a few books if you'd be fine.

09:01.170 --> 09:02.691
Yeah, of course.

09:02.952 --> 09:08.438
I heard it said that you actually had a library, it might have been in Bologna,

09:08.620 --> 09:12.344
The books became too heavy for the house and the floors were threatened.

09:12.765 --> 09:14.066
Is that true?

09:14.927 --> 09:16.990
I'm not speaking of old books.

09:18.552 --> 09:24.459
Well, I was glad to move twice.

09:25.720 --> 09:38.475
No, remark that in Europe and in Italy, more than in America, a normal intellectual like me receives

09:38.928 --> 09:44.133
Every day, 10 and 10 of free books.

09:45.594 --> 09:45.935
Okay.

09:46.275 --> 09:57.045
If my American publisher asked me to give him, let's say, 20 address of people to send it, here I am entitled to send 200.

09:57.265 --> 10:05.913
That is the policy of a European and in particular Italian or French.

10:06.193 --> 10:07.855
So I receive an enormous

10:08.273 --> 10:12.299
quantity of books, and I cannot keep all that.

10:13.660 --> 10:17.165
It sounds like you keep a lot of them, though, if you had to move twice.

10:17.366 --> 10:37.133
No, first of all, I have a chance, my country house is big, with a lot of enormous space, old rooms in which it's impossible to live, but they are there, and so I put a lot of things in there.

10:37.585 --> 10:41.128
Then I got my apartment in Boulogne.

10:41.188 --> 10:42.369
That's Latin Paris.

10:42.389 --> 10:44.151
That's the only French book.

10:45.372 --> 10:59.904
So when I moved here seven years ago, for the first time in my life, I succeeded in having the book on a single line, not two.

10:59.924 --> 11:05.389
Because with two lines, it's impossible to find.

11:05.409 --> 11:06.850
I ordered just a shelf.

11:10.897 --> 11:13.119
books.

11:13.139 --> 11:14.700
And they were 30,000.

11:14.901 --> 11:20.205
So the law was 30,000 they are, 30,000 they must remain.

11:20.706 --> 11:25.930
So every six months I have a transit area.

11:28.052 --> 11:36.519
I see if there are important books that I must keep, some other have to go to the countryside.

11:36.640 --> 11:38.541
To the countryside, but you don't get rid of them.

11:38.581 --> 11:39.542
You keep them.

11:39.702 --> 11:40.583
You still keep them.

11:41.474 --> 11:49.184
Yes, except you, except I. I also gave a lot of book on the local prism.

11:49.565 --> 12:10.873
The reason I asked about whether or not, going back to the earlier question about having the real thing, I was rereading your essay on Travels and Hyper-Reality, which is a delightful essay, and you talk about absolute fakes and originals, and the fascination in America, I guess, that was an essay that was really fascinated by

12:11.191 --> 12:16.397
by this obsession that Americans have for phony things.

12:16.958 --> 12:19.621
You know what happened in America with this book?

12:20.422 --> 12:38.363
This book, in Italy, has done, I don't know, some 3,000 copies, and then, in America, it was published by Hartford immediately after the name of the road, so thinking that even essays of mine could... It may.

12:38.596 --> 12:40.598
60,000 copies.

12:40.899 --> 12:46.986
So therefore they said, okay, finished, and we drew it.

12:47.006 --> 12:53.654
In the turn of a few years, it became a cult book in the villages for young people.

12:53.834 --> 12:57.399
Now they are reprinting it continuously.

12:57.479 --> 13:01.864
It seems that young people are... Do you have an explanation for that?

13:02.765 --> 13:04.367
Can you understand why that is?

13:04.870 --> 13:07.793
Because a lot of these essays are 20 and 30 years old in that book.

13:07.813 --> 13:16.824
Yes, but probably not only the States, they are living in a very, very fake era.

13:17.405 --> 13:20.869
And so they find there probably an explanation.

13:20.909 --> 13:30.760
The first reviews in the States were, well, I don't dare say so, but the

13:31.499 --> 13:42.156
They suggested, oh, why this gentleman who comes from Europe comes here to criticize our stuff.

13:42.176 --> 13:55.257
In fact, you remember, the book was describing the American fakes, but in order to use this example to suspect of our authentic stuff.

13:55.437 --> 13:57.020
So it was a double check.

13:57.440 --> 13:57.861
Anyway.

13:58.313 --> 14:03.578
The new generation seems to have taken it as a... Okay.

14:04.900 --> 14:16.371
Even in Great Britain, where they wanted to give another title, they didn't like travels in that reality.

14:16.391 --> 14:18.654
I suggested Faith in Felix.

14:19.134 --> 14:19.635
Okay.

14:20.415 --> 14:27.983
Then, all the following editions took the American title, because that was

14:29.836 --> 14:32.279
start to go around.

14:32.339 --> 14:34.983
That's magnificent.

14:35.003 --> 14:41.150
And... Because hyperreality, when you think of it, that title was 20 years ahead of its time.

14:41.591 --> 14:44.254
Now we have hypertext and all that.

14:44.274 --> 14:44.875
Yes, probably.

14:45.316 --> 14:48.560
Also this can be a virtual reality.

14:48.840 --> 14:50.622
Yes, you use that phrase.

14:50.963 --> 14:53.807
I wrote the essay in 75.

14:53.827 --> 14:54.908
Yes.

14:54.928 --> 14:59.674
But it's... You know, it's always difficult to say why it's a book, it's a portion.

14:59.873 --> 15:02.818
It happens.

15:03.619 --> 15:04.681
It happens.

15:04.701 --> 15:26.235
But what I'm trying to get at, and I don't know if I'm driving at it in an eloquent way, but this concern that you seem to have in that essay, which I think is brilliant, about the copy as opposed to the original, and of course this morning at the Capitulare, the biblioteca, we were looking at a document, a bill of sale,

15:26.654 --> 15:30.719
that was 700 years old, and yet it was a copy of another one.

15:30.839 --> 15:33.463
Is this a copy, or is it an artifact, in your view?

15:33.583 --> 15:34.023
I wonder.

15:35.265 --> 15:52.527
You know, if you remember, in the travels, I quoted a visit to the Wrigley Museum, where there was an iron statue, and it's there.

15:53.755 --> 16:11.079
bronze copy of a marble copy in the Vatican Museum of Rome from a lost bronze original of the 15th century.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.923
So, which is the original?

16:13.943 --> 16:23.577
Since the original was bronze and in Sarasota is bronze and in the Vatican Museum is a marble stone

16:27.758 --> 16:34.566
You know, the science writer in the United States, Stephen Jay Gould, are you familiar with him?

16:34.687 --> 16:35.207
Good friend.

16:35.367 --> 16:36.108
Yes, wonderful.

16:36.148 --> 16:40.374
He told me of a case where there was a replica made of the Spirit of St.

16:40.434 --> 16:43.297
Louis, Lindbergh's plane, a replica.

16:44.078 --> 16:50.887
And nobody wanted to have their photograph taken next to it, because even though it looked just like the original, but it wasn't the real thing.

16:51.427 --> 16:57.715
What is there about this passion for the real thing as opposed to the copy, do you think?

16:58.640 --> 17:09.637
Listen, first of all, maybe you don't have a long essay of mind or faith.

17:10.138 --> 17:27.465
It was published in the Limits of Interpretation, even in English, because I am not sure to have an additional copy here, but it was published by Indiana University Press, and I make a sort of very

17:28.778 --> 17:33.745
complex phenomenology of all the kinds of faiths.

17:33.765 --> 17:37.671
Not in the sense of travel, but scholarly.

17:38.232 --> 17:57.199
Because it was the introduction to an international congress made by the Monumenta Germania Historic of Old Faiths in the Middle Ages, and I was invited to deliver a general lecture on the meiotics of faith.

17:58.732 --> 18:15.330
But, you know, there are so-called, Nelson Goodman called them, allographic art and homographic art.

18:15.390 --> 18:26.562
There is a certain difference between the first manuscript of the Divine Comedy and

18:26.879 --> 18:38.052
When we are dealing with this kind of art, from the aesthetic point of view there is no difference.

18:38.192 --> 18:39.994
From the aesthetic point of view.

18:40.014 --> 18:46.962
Yes, you can write Dante in both books, in a way you read it better in the modern one.

18:47.122 --> 18:53.629
So the rest is only antiquarian passion.

18:54.065 --> 18:56.127
which has nothing to do with antiquity.

18:56.508 --> 19:05.419
It would be the same if instead of the first manuscript of Dante, it was the first manuscript of Napoleon.

19:05.519 --> 19:09.323
It's only the antiquity there.

19:10.024 --> 19:20.176
And these psychoanalysts speak of anal pulsions, who have the real thing.

19:20.296 --> 19:23.380
Museums are living at all, because they are

19:24.254 --> 19:25.936
witnesses of the past.

19:27.278 --> 19:30.722
Different is with that painting.

19:31.243 --> 19:35.708
This is original Dutch painting.

19:35.728 --> 19:42.857
Every reproduction up to now cannot be as perfect as the original.

19:42.877 --> 19:51.408
In this case, the respect or the love of the original has aesthetic value.

19:51.428 --> 19:52.810
What to do with the statue?

19:53.617 --> 19:59.004
Obviously, it is absolutely impossible to reproduce the Moses of Michelangelo.

20:00.766 --> 20:06.854
In fact, if you go to Florence, and you see on the square, the tabula, Michelangelo is not the real one.

20:07.855 --> 20:17.107
The real one is inside, and nobody knows it, and everybody worships the fake one, because there is no difference.

20:17.908 --> 20:22.294
And in this case, there are fetishes.

20:23.115 --> 20:23.455
Fetishes?

20:23.907 --> 20:31.338
This is Hermes of Parcitalis.

20:31.358 --> 20:32.499
What is the difference?

20:32.860 --> 20:40.491
It is the difference that it is a choke and not stone.

20:40.511 --> 20:52.007
So probably the real stone has a sort of consistency that you can detect even at the first glance.

20:52.865 --> 20:56.128
The value of this is 100 dollars.

20:58.871 --> 20:58.991
Yes.

20:59.051 --> 21:07.139
My wife found the form in the museum, it was worth there, and with 100 dollars, jack up!

21:07.439 --> 21:10.762
That is a joke, a quotation.

21:12.484 --> 21:18.990
But, to be sincere, the difference between that and the original

21:19.561 --> 21:25.710
For a young person who has to understand the beauty of the fetalism, the same.

21:25.730 --> 21:28.213
All the rest is atmosphere.

21:28.233 --> 21:29.716
But are we used by atmosphere?

21:29.736 --> 21:34.863
Think that the statue is not in Greece, but in the museum.

21:35.163 --> 21:38.408
I don't remember where... I think Florence said.

21:39.409 --> 21:42.454
So, in most cases, mere fetalism.

21:45.158 --> 21:48.943
But, let me read them as a book of the collection.

21:50.341 --> 21:59.274
What is the difference between having the old book and the new one?

21:59.294 --> 22:01.137
There are two other cases.

22:01.157 --> 22:04.822
One, there are no new editions of that book.

22:05.443 --> 22:09.710
But to have the old one means to have the only opportunity to have a certain text.

22:09.730 --> 22:13.375
It is not irrelevant.

22:13.395 --> 22:20.145
Second, you love the book not for the content, but for the typography.

22:21.509 --> 22:24.453
design, refining.

22:25.675 --> 22:28.959
And sometimes it is the excellence of the paper.

22:29.460 --> 22:36.289
I have books that have 500 years and they are creating under your fingers.

22:36.590 --> 22:51.330
In this case, the original, even though there are probably 300 copies around, the original is really something more similar to their painting than, because

22:52.357 --> 22:59.025
And even more, when the original brings on the margins possession marks.

22:59.145 --> 23:06.954
There are certain notes, hand notes, that are so beautiful to see and show you.

23:07.135 --> 23:17.767
Paracelsus, that in itself was the price of value because it's only a single volume and a complete collection is nine.

23:18.168 --> 23:20.811
But this copy has such beautiful

23:22.090 --> 23:28.360
handwritten note that in itself is something beautiful to see.

23:28.380 --> 23:48.672
So with the book, you understand that the difference between fetishism, sense of possession and the real experience that the old object can provide, you are, I think, different according to

23:49.681 --> 23:53.066
Obviously, my divine comedy, I don't need it for reading it.

23:54.087 --> 24:07.287
That is the emotion to have one of the first copies, that is the first with the images of the paradise, before they even have to... And this is Dante, after all.

24:08.028 --> 24:12.214
Yes, but if I have to read Dante, I go to too much.

24:12.314 --> 24:18.203
Even though there is a friend of mine who collects Italian poetry,

24:18.622 --> 24:33.504
from the Renaissance, and he says, ah, you cannot believe to leave Ariotto and Tassio in the original edition in the way that he thought, is a different emotion.

24:35.047 --> 24:42.057
Well, yes, in some way, for somebody it can be so, too.

24:42.077 --> 24:47.886
What I'm driving at now, you also have been very actively involved, there was a conference in California on the future of the book

24:48.203 --> 24:53.128
The University of California Press did a very good collection of essays.

24:53.188 --> 24:54.570
You wrote an afterword for it.

24:55.030 --> 25:04.701
Your interest in this, and I guess your concern for the book, for the loss of an archival copy, I guess.

25:05.381 --> 25:13.570
Is this about to happen, do you think, that as we write things that there will be no physical copies of books?

25:13.904 --> 25:21.776
that there will be no archival copy of a physical book, of a printed book, or of a manuscript, that in the future we are going to have books.

25:22.718 --> 25:37.540
I took part in that symposium, and I have written the same essay in 25 different forms, in different meetings, only because people are stupid.

25:38.041 --> 25:39.203
Sometimes you have to ask.

25:40.212 --> 25:42.615
to cope also with the stupidity of people.

25:42.835 --> 25:50.485
So, people are stupid and they believe that if they are scared that internet books will disappear.

25:51.126 --> 25:54.530
It's absolutely ridiculous and a bad.

25:54.931 --> 26:01.079
So, you are, you are, I am, the people like me are obsessed by the word.

26:01.719 --> 26:05.925
Do will books disappear?

26:05.945 --> 26:09.509
And you have to tell them no.

26:09.609 --> 26:10.050
And so,

26:10.756 --> 26:18.807
They feel and happy because of the words of the year 2000, they bring the apocalyptic scenarios.

26:19.228 --> 26:24.355
They would you to tell them, yes, books will disappear.

26:24.435 --> 26:31.785
So they had to write a very long article about if you are so cruel to say, no, no, no.

26:33.368 --> 26:48.090
But you know, last month I was in Stockholm, and they have the brand new national, the new Royal Library, and they blasted these book magazines, they call them, out of the granite.

26:48.852 --> 26:51.816
And there are five of them, ten actually.

26:52.477 --> 26:57.064
The lower two are empty, and they say that they have planned it to...

26:57.466 --> 26:59.229
to be sufficient through the year 2050.

26:59.749 --> 27:06.199
Now, the librarian said to me, but I don't think it will ever be filled because the internet will replace a lot.

27:06.219 --> 27:08.042
This is the librarian in Stockholm.

27:08.162 --> 27:09.504
I see it.

27:09.544 --> 27:15.012
Obviously, the old ones will not disappear.

27:15.633 --> 27:21.942
On the contrary, and unfortunately, for me, they will cause more people.

27:21.962 --> 27:26.629
The new one will disappear because I repeat, I cannot say

27:27.740 --> 27:31.165
12 hours in place of a screen to read it.

27:31.566 --> 27:32.547
I read this object.

27:33.088 --> 27:45.285
And this object is like scissors, spoke, hammer, a bicycle, a kind of thing that once I've been invented, you cannot invent something better.

27:46.387 --> 27:49.011
You can read it even in your bathroom.

27:49.832 --> 27:50.012
Okay?

27:50.633 --> 27:51.975
Not with the computer.

27:52.883 --> 28:10.481
But you probably agree that, and especially when you are a scholar, and you see a lot of academics, I think a lot of scientific papers will be written and published only on the electronically.

28:10.501 --> 28:22.013
This is the important chance, because it is the same kind of academic papers that will be half usually published by the Greuther,

28:22.685 --> 28:28.051
include $400 a volume.

28:28.071 --> 28:29.373
No volume will have them.

28:29.813 --> 28:32.716
You can only see them in the library.

28:33.637 --> 28:38.062
So I am happy to have them on internet.

28:38.242 --> 28:42.507
It is the kind of material that, like the encyclopedia.

28:44.590 --> 28:52.118
A good encyclopedia occupies two sales.

28:58.038 --> 29:01.363
wall.

29:01.423 --> 29:08.173
If you live in a room like that, even though you receive an encyclopedia as a gift, you cannot take it.

29:08.794 --> 29:17.186
So, the encyclopedia in this case, okay, because nobody goes in the bathroom to the encyclopedia.

29:17.927 --> 29:20.611
You can consult it by this case.

29:20.631 --> 29:26.560
So, there will be a lot of material that will probably disappear from books,

29:26.962 --> 29:38.839
And things like that, even though, even in that case, after I've seen the screen, I feel the need to print it in order to... That's right.

29:39.580 --> 29:41.242
Okay, fine.

29:41.262 --> 29:47.691
But all the rest of it, all the books, couldn't... But first, the information is always changing in Encyclopedias.

29:48.131 --> 29:49.273
So, I mean, it's...

29:49.422 --> 29:51.464
Like for instance the Oxford English Dictionary.

29:51.724 --> 30:04.899
Today the sarcopedia is already outdated, so why not to have the opportunity to have it updated every day?

30:05.079 --> 30:13.708
But a sarcopedia volume is not a book, it is, I don't know, something like a car.

30:14.414 --> 30:35.602
If you don't mind my jumping around in questions from area to area, from subject matter to subject matter, but when you wrote The Name of the Rose, you were already a world-renowned scholar and academic and known in your field, and you were certainly writing for a specific audience of other academics and scholars.

30:37.104 --> 30:41.189
But yet you were also writing journalism, and you said you were very proud to write journalism.

30:41.229 --> 30:41.670
You liked journalism.

30:41.920 --> 30:44.503
to write things that you could see in print the next day.

30:44.543 --> 30:54.697
I'm wondering, how are you able to switch your writing from the professional application to the general application?

30:55.297 --> 30:57.200
Is this something that comes very easy to do?

30:57.781 --> 31:04.309
You mean from scholarship to novel, or the continual oscillation between journalism and science?

31:04.409 --> 31:05.751
All of the above.

31:05.984 --> 31:30.169
There's relations between... I'm not the only one in the world, only excluded by dysplasia of the American scholars, because it's so rare, but in France, in Germany, Italy, Spain and so on, it's pretty usual that an academic person also writes for magazines or newspapers.

31:30.453 --> 31:34.538
Due to the fact that in America they are isolated in their campus.

31:34.839 --> 31:36.541
You see, here we live.

31:36.661 --> 31:37.382
Indeed.

31:37.883 --> 31:46.694
A city where there is a university and the great newspapers and other things.

31:47.255 --> 31:53.663
And then I see it's very nourishing.

31:53.683 --> 31:59.751
I mean, the activity of writing for a newspaper helps a lot to

32:00.524 --> 32:11.420
to speak in a, yes, to reduce a certain academic rigidity or clamps.

32:12.542 --> 32:24.460
And so it helps only when afterwards to write for academic forms.

32:24.520 --> 32:26.743
Were you surprised by the world reaction?

32:26.763 --> 32:30.008
I know you ask this all the time, but when you wrote Name of the Rose,

32:30.477 --> 32:48.375
You must, were you doing this to amuse yourself, or were you doing it, did you have any expectation that it would have the kind of impact that it's had on the world, not just European leaders, but readers all over the world, a very scholarly detective story like that.

32:49.356 --> 32:56.923
In my widest dreams, while writing, I said, ah, I can do pent-on-comments.

32:57.157 --> 32:59.240
I see that.

32:59.901 --> 33:02.044
I can do better.

33:02.584 --> 33:04.026
Yes, yes, good.

33:04.787 --> 33:23.253
You told me also, when we met the first time, that even though you didn't realize it at the time, that novel turns on a text of Aristotle, that you actually had an old text of Aristotle, an ugly one buried, and that maybe subconsciously made it.

33:23.273 --> 33:26.337
But I discovered it years ago, later.

33:26.958 --> 33:55.615
But do you think that that particular copy was in the back of your mind when you were... Well, look, since I discovered that I have, in all my books, the same book I described in my novel, probably I... I got in my memory for... No, my memory, my... Barry, I don't know, for 25 years, this image that I saw one day, I don't know.

33:56.438 --> 34:03.865
The fact is that the book was here, and I had completely forgotten.

34:03.885 --> 34:06.408
And yet there was, and you describe it.

34:07.068 --> 34:09.871
Yes, I assure you, yes.

34:10.031 --> 34:11.092
It's a book.

34:11.172 --> 34:16.498
So you see that you don't have to interview with him.

34:17.018 --> 34:20.241
Well, I'd rather have to say, maybe you can show us.

34:20.642 --> 34:22.964
Now tell me about your book.

34:23.364 --> 34:25.146
It will be about libraries,

34:25.868 --> 34:44.828
I'm really interested in this concept of book culture in general, and the making of books, the preserving of books, the reading of books.

34:44.868 --> 34:46.530
So I want to ask you about reading.

34:46.550 --> 34:54.458
You've written an essay on readers, that piece you wrote on Italo Calvino, your Norton lectures, for instance, at Harvard.

34:54.978 --> 34:58.883
and you wrote a book published by Indiana University on the reader.

34:59.864 --> 35:02.627
We talk about interactive fiction, for instance.

35:02.647 --> 35:06.171
That's a big thing now where they put fiction on the net.

35:06.612 --> 35:07.914
Yeah, that's another story.

35:08.674 --> 35:23.492
But nevertheless, they don't realize that readers have always been involved in the text, as you point out, and that readers, writers do invite, in many cases, the reader to come up with a different scenario, don't you?

35:23.933 --> 35:24.073
I think

35:24.863 --> 35:35.223
No, interactive fiction, I repeat, it is like a jazz jam session.

35:36.005 --> 35:37.087
A jam session.

35:37.107 --> 35:40.754
But jam sessions have not destroyed other kinds of music.

35:43.560 --> 35:47.327
So, by both, they are two different things.

35:47.898 --> 35:58.849
So all those utopias, the new interactive hypertextical stuff will destroy the traditional author, notion of author.

35:59.630 --> 36:00.331
They are silly.

36:00.351 --> 36:09.820
It was like to say that the brothels of New Orleans would have destroyed the Carnegie Hall of the sky.

36:10.161 --> 36:13.264
And cooking, though, pretty.

36:13.767 --> 36:20.295
Well, I came across a very interesting statistic in a book titled, When Russia Learned to Read.

36:20.956 --> 36:28.005
And as early as, as recently as 1897, only 21% of the Russian people could read.

36:28.025 --> 36:30.849
79% were illiterate.

36:31.329 --> 36:38.779
And yet, for all the illiteracy, this came through a period when Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky and Turgenev

36:39.029 --> 36:42.634
and Pushkin and Goble were writing some of the world's greatest novels.

36:42.954 --> 36:46.079
It didn't matter that 80% of the people couldn't read.

36:46.239 --> 36:58.816
I wonder if there's a parallel today where we have all of this illiteracy because of computers, illiteracy in terms of reading serious literature, if that would threaten the production of serious literature.

36:59.116 --> 37:02.802
I don't believe it.

37:03.342 --> 37:07.568
Even going around today in one of the bookstores,

37:08.594 --> 37:22.154
In Milan, I see a lot of people, young people, that before didn't go to a bookstore, a lot of books published.

37:23.476 --> 37:37.656
Now, since the publishers are not suicidal people, they do it for money, and they continue to publish books, I suspect that there is somebody

37:38.193 --> 37:47.521
It seems that the theory works.

37:47.601 --> 37:59.852
It means in the same way in which the arrival of TV has not decreased the number of newspapers readers.

37:59.872 --> 38:03.975
There are more newspapers readers today than three years ago.

38:04.816 --> 38:07.018
It seems that only for the new

38:08.399 --> 38:16.529
Minks are not damaging the influence of the growth of books.

38:19.852 --> 38:21.294
Judging by average.

38:21.955 --> 38:22.836
Certainly.

38:23.757 --> 38:34.930
After television there were people who started to lose their whole day watching television with a beer and they were eliminated from the...

38:35.197 --> 38:36.078
from mankind.

38:36.138 --> 38:39.181
These are critical cases.

38:39.201 --> 38:47.248
It's true that there are kids that spend all the days in place of the TV.

38:48.029 --> 38:54.995
But there were people that at the time of Tolstoy, they were illiterate.

38:55.856 --> 38:57.057
They didn't read at all.

38:57.477 --> 39:03.803
So they were not readers who have immigrated and simply

39:04.255 --> 39:33.165
we are still in a society with a great quantity of people which remain outside the treated universe also because we are five or six billions and before there were only two and so there is a certain percent but this is not the proof that the new instruments are jeopardizing the

39:33.500 --> 39:35.142
Production of serious literature.

39:37.586 --> 39:49.104
Well, indeed, it was a phenomenon, but even in the lighting circle, when they started to do the Romain-Pierre Dome, people started to say, okay, so literature is finished there.

39:49.284 --> 39:49.805
But when St.

39:49.845 --> 39:55.493
Dan Balzac was writing from the same market, he was Balzac.

39:56.475 --> 40:01.262
Would you say that, I'm also interested in writers such as yourself,

40:01.968 --> 40:05.032
whether or not they feel that they are products of their reading.

40:05.052 --> 40:13.121
Would you say that you are a product, intellectually, emotionally, of the books that you have read throughout your life?

40:14.023 --> 40:21.131
Have the books that you have read helped produce the person that you are intellectually?

40:21.552 --> 40:27.739
Certainly, yes, but to such an extent that I think is a triviality.

40:32.782 --> 40:36.748
product at the same time of verbal education.

40:37.228 --> 40:44.559
But I mean, I think of certain... Certainly, yes, certainly.

40:44.739 --> 40:53.672
Certainly, if I didn't read in my youth, I don't know, Scandal or Binocchio, I would be a different person.

40:53.692 --> 40:54.673
Okay.

40:54.693 --> 40:59.901
Well, I think of people like Shah, who everything he learned was in the British Library.

41:00.041 --> 41:00.882
Virginia Woolf, who

41:01.250 --> 41:04.636
who never had any education outside, you know, the home.

41:04.977 --> 41:15.756
And yet she read in libraries, and the books that she read, she was quite adamant with it were the forces that helped shape her as an individual.

41:15.776 --> 41:23.410
She was not formally educated.

41:23.609 --> 41:25.291
Yes, the words.

41:25.552 --> 41:26.213
It's wonderful.

41:26.233 --> 41:27.374
Yes, I'm using that.

41:27.394 --> 41:48.604
There is another one that never been translated, I think, in Italian, 1913, L'uomo finito of Papini, which is a sort of intellectual autobiography, a sort of sick young person who spent his life

41:50.035 --> 41:57.484
not blind, but on the verge of reading tomes of books.

41:57.824 --> 42:08.136
This is a beautiful story about the global immersion of a young person.

42:08.156 --> 42:18.608
And certainly you can't see your life, but you cannot say what I'm saying, because it's probably in the case also

42:19.162 --> 42:25.050
from a illustrated page that he looked back at the age of four.

42:26.773 --> 42:33.822
I have certain images from my childhood class that are still magical.

42:33.842 --> 42:48.122
So things I found, browsing, old books, father, in the center of the box with old books from father and probably

42:48.912 --> 42:56.744
If I had not met those books, I would have written the name of the Lord.

42:56.764 --> 42:58.507
Maybe another thing.

42:59.288 --> 43:00.450
Maybe Lady Chesley.

43:00.911 --> 43:15.173
In your travels in hyper-reality, you mentioned how when people in America particularly describe your profession, they say the arcane symbiotics

43:15.423 --> 43:20.170
an arcane discipline that upsets you.

43:20.270 --> 43:28.042
Somebody invented it for the first time and it remained like a stamp on the label.

43:29.163 --> 43:34.811
But how old is symbiotics as a scholarly discipline?

43:35.733 --> 43:40.620
Is it something fairly recent in terms of a... Listen.

43:42.322 --> 43:45.687
The name is only 2,000 years.

43:45.868 --> 43:48.632
Only 2,000 years.

43:50.094 --> 43:50.415
Really?

43:52.237 --> 43:53.800
Nice.

43:53.820 --> 44:02.574
How now people who make the history of the world goes back before Homer.

44:02.594 --> 44:06.760
I mean, mankind has always been interested in this.

44:06.925 --> 44:10.831
the mechanism of communicating and speaking.

44:10.851 --> 44:12.933
The term was used by Gallen.

44:13.654 --> 44:19.302
The stoics were doing something that I recognize today as good semiotics.

44:19.463 --> 44:21.265
In the Middle Ages they did it.

44:21.906 --> 44:30.658
Locke, at the end of the essay on human understanding and science, and subdivide it in physics and semiotics.

44:30.699 --> 44:36.747
That may include semiotics, maybe it is philosophically at large.

44:37.722 --> 44:44.752
But what, in the 19th century in America, first you are speaking.

44:44.772 --> 44:45.794
Okay.

44:45.814 --> 44:57.310
If you want the data for the academic wave, then we are using the data in 1964 because all ambassadors started.

44:57.991 --> 45:04.000
But that's...

45:06.815 --> 45:16.068
It's only like to take 1776 as the date of the beginning of the American continent.

45:16.088 --> 45:19.533
That's right, that's okay.

45:19.673 --> 45:22.778
But how does one decide to be a semiotician?

45:22.818 --> 45:30.589
How do you decide that this is going to be the field of, a field of study, because you've done so many other different things as well.

45:31.050 --> 45:36.197
But your fascination... If you want an easy formula,

45:36.447 --> 45:45.178
Well, I was working on the avant-garde, the joys, and so on.

45:45.738 --> 45:54.890
And at the same time, I was interested in mass communication and the very pictures, I don't know, the personalities of TV.

45:54.910 --> 46:04.041
At some point, I asked myself if those two things were so separated or if there was not a chance of more general

46:05.067 --> 46:14.197
If you are able to justify and to confirm, or a further one.

46:14.217 --> 46:14.497
Okay.

46:14.517 --> 46:15.879
I see.

46:17.240 --> 46:20.944
If you want to jump in any questions, you might guess, but there are any questions.

46:21.085 --> 46:30.435
I'm saying if my wife has any questions, I usually invite her to ask anything if she feels a... Yes, but I hear you as God.

46:31.816 --> 46:33.218
No?

46:34.852 --> 46:41.478
I had a question.

46:41.999 --> 46:45.222
Let me just shut this off.

46:45.242 --> 46:51.207
I mentioned that one of the, you asked me what this new book is about, and I mentioned this concept of book culture.

46:51.588 --> 47:04.420
I'm really interested, and I've been going to England and to France and to Germany, national attitudes, particularly, and one easy way to see it is the national library, how they decide what's important by what they collect.

47:04.855 --> 47:19.810
And one of the amazing things that we've noticed here in Italy is there are over a thousand ecclesiastical libraries which have 27 million books here in Italy, in addition to whatever the national library system has.

47:20.190 --> 47:23.353
And that says something... You mean a library, not a bookstore?

47:23.473 --> 47:24.694
No, no, libraries.

47:24.754 --> 47:32.702
I'm also interested in this, the attitude... Anyway, this seems to me to be pretty...

47:33.492 --> 48:03.043
there was the church in 2000 at first but and so the other powers were frequently foreign powers passing through the ones who established you know it would be the same in France in which you can find in the abbeys and a lot of them then

48:03.445 --> 48:27.765
And then Napoleon and the revolution that

48:28.943 --> 48:41.095
seized a lot of enthusiastic goods and transported them into state libraries.

48:41.936 --> 48:58.393
But at the origin, where our friend Libri is found in the equation, going around for all the convents at that time, they were still there.

49:00.196 --> 49:08.125
The ecclesiastical library collections here, I think, are probably even easily just as important as the national collections in Italy.

49:09.366 --> 49:11.348
Some of them, certainly, yes.

49:12.029 --> 49:13.811
Which is almost unique in the world.

49:13.911 --> 49:19.477
I can't think of any other country that would have church collect... Maybe in Spain.

49:20.178 --> 49:21.539
Maybe in Spain, yeah.

49:21.800 --> 49:29.308
I repeat, don't forget that Italy had the central state

49:29.693 --> 49:36.722
until 130 years ago.

49:36.742 --> 49:37.843
That's very recent.

49:37.864 --> 49:38.805
Yes.

49:38.825 --> 49:39.926
That's fantastic.

49:40.046 --> 49:43.270
We are a young nation.

49:43.291 --> 49:53.944
So there was no central power taking care of the enterprise.

49:53.964 --> 49:59.211
That's why, for instance, you kind of find Torino, it seems,

49:59.512 --> 50:08.763
state archives, which is a master case in itself, they say, but in Tiedmont there was, since the Middle Ages, a monarchy.

50:09.604 --> 50:18.054
But it was the only part of Italy which had, for one thousand years, a national monarchy.

50:19.616 --> 50:29.367
It was not by chance that it was at Tiedmont to conquer or to unify the rest of Italy, because it was the only dynasty

50:29.768 --> 50:38.220
that could boast a certain right to do that.

50:38.240 --> 50:46.011
Take Milan, but there were the Germans, and the Spaniards, and then the Austrians.

50:46.031 --> 50:56.586
And at the certain port you have Carlo Federico Borromeo, that being the only real power here that they

50:57.106 --> 51:02.131
to care also of the development of culture in their own way.

51:03.011 --> 51:04.353
That fascinated us.

51:04.373 --> 51:06.715
They didn't collect all the books of Luther.

51:07.175 --> 51:15.483
Well, of course, but that was one of the reasons they established the Ambrosiana, was in opposition to Luther, I think.

51:15.503 --> 51:17.384
As in the Counter-Reformation.

51:17.404 --> 51:19.947
As in the Counter-Reformation, yes.

51:20.007 --> 51:26.893
But what amazed us yesterday is that these books, these wonderful things that were acquired at the Ambrosiana,

51:27.380 --> 51:29.763
were authorized 350 years ago.

51:29.783 --> 51:31.526
They went out and bought these things.

51:31.906 --> 51:33.388
Money was no object.

51:33.409 --> 51:40.759
They even understood then, in the year 1600, 1609, how important it was to get these things and to save them.

51:40.779 --> 51:42.982
That's very remarkable to me.

51:43.343 --> 51:52.375
I mean, it seems to be very early in time when people recognized the great importance of these things to set them up in libraries and how they would spend money to get them.

51:53.317 --> 51:54.298
Very interesting.

51:57.333 --> 52:12.536
I think this, let's say, humanistic side was present in all of the great, the great heart of the history of the church and from St.

52:12.556 --> 52:14.239
Augustine or St.

52:14.559 --> 52:16.462
Debrorio and the schoolmen.

52:18.285 --> 52:22.491
If not by chance that St.

52:22.511 --> 52:25.095
Benedict and the monastic

52:27.708 --> 52:44.612
just in order to preserve the patrimony of the culture that was disappearing under the barbarian invaders.

52:44.632 --> 52:57.090
Part of the ecclesiastical world started since the fall of the Roman Empire

52:57.695 --> 53:07.948
to consider themselves the only keepers and savers of culture.

53:08.929 --> 53:25.050
Obviously, operating their own choices and censure, okay, okay, but don't forget that in the Renaissance people discovered the great classics of the Greek literature.

53:25.130 --> 53:26.031
Who are they going to do that?

53:27.445 --> 53:30.989
were in the monasteries.

53:31.009 --> 53:38.897
They were there simply, probably, in the last closet, in the last room.

53:39.177 --> 53:40.078
But they were there.

53:41.380 --> 53:46.045
Otherwise, they were not archaeological excavations.

53:46.065 --> 53:47.767
Well, they're capitularists.

53:48.107 --> 53:50.730
All the pagan poetry was there.

53:51.851 --> 53:52.432
Preserved.

53:52.932 --> 53:55.054
Not celebrated, but preserved.

53:55.815 --> 53:56.676
That is so important.

53:56.977 --> 54:03.586
They said something at the Capitula Library this morning.

54:03.606 --> 54:08.212
They had some manuscripts that they put up on top of a shelf and they forgot about.

54:08.252 --> 54:11.356
They were there for 200 years before they found them again.

54:11.376 --> 54:12.257
They were looking for them.

54:12.297 --> 54:13.239
Very, very important.

54:13.679 --> 54:14.821
I can't remember what they were.

54:14.861 --> 54:17.524
They were codices.

54:17.544 --> 54:18.305
Very important.

54:18.826 --> 54:24.874
They put them up on the shelf and they stayed there for 200 years before they found them again.

54:25.090 --> 54:27.293
But over in Verona, that was very interesting.

54:27.313 --> 54:28.875
They didn't go out and buy the things.

54:28.955 --> 54:33.461
These were items that were produced in the scriptorium right around there.

54:33.501 --> 54:40.711
But they did them there, and they established a library right there in Verona to preserve these materials.

54:40.871 --> 54:46.278
No, it's a permanent impulse in Minnesota.

54:46.298 --> 54:55.030
No, it's a Benedictine, immense Benedictine monastery, which is the only...

54:55.583 --> 55:13.961
Breuer Bauhaus Monastery in the world, because it was a week, first and partially made as noble Christ Master Breuer, one of the architects of Bauhaus or was another Catholic, very curious.

55:13.981 --> 55:15.703
And what is their task?

55:16.804 --> 55:23.531
They started after the war saying there would be the atomic holocaust.

55:23.691 --> 55:24.612
Everything would disappear.

55:25.368 --> 55:39.326
And since then, they are visiting systematically, I would say, industrially, every country, and they still microfilm every existing manuscript.

55:39.946 --> 55:41.488
The Benedictines are doing it?

55:41.549 --> 55:42.550
Yes, in Minnesota.

55:42.570 --> 55:45.514
And they put you something as well as a drawer.

55:46.034 --> 55:52.322
And so they have enormous of the... They have also beautiful manuscripts there, really.

55:52.743 --> 55:54.565
But then, in a sort of...

55:55.928 --> 56:06.506
on the immense space, doors, doors, doors, doors, doors, and this is all the geography.

56:07.168 --> 56:09.512
They have finished with the geography.

56:09.612 --> 56:12.437
They have finished with Austria.

56:12.677 --> 56:17.245
They have never started with Italy because they don't know.

56:17.647 --> 56:21.672
I just learned about this last week.

56:21.733 --> 56:30.124
I was at the New York Public Library where they have an exhibition on the Romanovs, and Edward Kasenek, who is the curator, told me about this Minnesota thing.

56:30.144 --> 56:31.546
He says, you've got to go up to Minnesota.

56:31.706 --> 56:34.570
He said, it's all microfilm, but they're doing everything in the world.

56:35.131 --> 56:37.093
This is the second time I've heard about it in a week.

56:37.834 --> 56:39.476
In Minnesota, of all places.

56:39.997 --> 56:44.363
Which is an old Benedictine obsession, the barbarians.

56:44.984 --> 56:55.139
are arriving, now the barbarians are the Pentagon, and we are hiding and preserving here for the future generation.

56:55.399 --> 56:57.562
Have you been to the facility in Minnesota?

56:57.582 --> 56:58.904
Have you been to see it?

56:58.924 --> 57:00.046
Yes, they showed me.

57:00.266 --> 57:02.630
To see the manuscript part, you see all this.

57:02.950 --> 57:03.952
I will show you.

57:04.252 --> 57:05.494
Copies?

57:05.954 --> 57:06.736
Yes, drawers.

57:07.156 --> 57:11.903
You have 200 micro-pics on it.

57:12.727 --> 57:15.189
It's not so amusing to look at that.

57:15.670 --> 57:22.355
But up there, they have a library with beautiful cottages.

57:23.176 --> 57:23.616
Interesting.

57:23.636 --> 57:31.003
It goes back to what we started with, the copies as opposed to the actual document.

57:31.023 --> 57:32.984
We still are preserving the information.

57:33.305 --> 57:34.686
Of course, it's in black and white, right?

57:34.726 --> 57:35.707
The microfilms.

57:35.807 --> 57:38.269
I guess so.

57:38.309 --> 57:42.092
And since they started in the 1950s, some of them

57:42.292 --> 58:02.975
I've got an hour, and I don't want to overextend our welcome.

58:05.078 --> 58:07.260
Can you show us some of your books?

58:07.340 --> 58:09.042
Do you mind if I take a few photographs?
