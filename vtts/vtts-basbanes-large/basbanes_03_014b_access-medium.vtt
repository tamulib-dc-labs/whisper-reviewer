WEBVTT

00:02.883 --> 00:09.390
And so they got really into bird watching later in life.

00:09.410 --> 00:11.732
These are their report cards.

00:13.073 --> 00:18.759
This is Wilbur's report card.

00:22.883 --> 00:30.831
With some of the topics he's studying, like reading, spelling, writing, composition, arithmetic, grammar, geography, U.S.

00:30.871 --> 00:31.472
history.

00:34.203 --> 00:37.809
I mean, their grades are fairly good.

00:37.829 --> 00:39.292
94 in arithmetic.

00:40.434 --> 00:41.455
94 in grammar.

00:41.475 --> 00:43.258
100 in geography.

00:45.202 --> 00:46.023
No mark for U.S.

00:46.043 --> 00:46.444
history.

00:47.586 --> 00:48.587
Spelling 92.

00:49.769 --> 00:50.150
All A's.

00:50.250 --> 00:50.911
Composition B.

00:50.931 --> 00:51.593
80.

00:52.454 --> 00:53.516
Deportment 100.

00:53.616 --> 00:54.998
Good for you, Orville.

00:55.018 --> 00:55.840
Well, here's Orville.

00:56.281 --> 00:57.763
Habits of application.

00:57.878 --> 00:58.359
Medium.

00:59.480 --> 01:00.581
Whatever that meant.

01:00.701 --> 01:01.362
What year is that?

01:01.622 --> 01:02.323
This is 1888.

01:02.363 --> 01:03.003
1888.

01:03.424 --> 01:04.886
Central High School.

01:04.906 --> 01:07.028
Yeah.

01:07.048 --> 01:08.730
Deportment in and about school.

01:08.830 --> 01:09.110
Good.

01:09.310 --> 01:09.550
Good.

01:10.131 --> 01:11.172
Doing okay.

01:11.372 --> 01:12.434
All right.

01:13.515 --> 01:16.358
It's kind of a shot being fired across his mouth.

01:16.578 --> 01:25.928
One of the interesting things that people often ask is, why did Orville and Wilber record all the stuff in diaries?

01:26.228 --> 01:32.717
And the thought is, their father kept a diary from 1857 until he died in 1917.

01:36.202 --> 01:37.704
They were very prolific writers.

01:37.745 --> 01:38.826
They were well-educated.

01:38.846 --> 01:39.707
They were well-read.

01:39.848 --> 01:45.436
They were following an example, I think, from their father of recording what they were doing.

01:45.636 --> 01:46.717
They were the bishop's voice.

01:47.078 --> 01:51.064
Well, yeah, as Tom Crouch says.

01:51.124 --> 01:54.308
This is one of their father's diaries.

01:54.348 --> 01:55.510
This particular one,

01:56.266 --> 02:03.977
is from the year, well, the day that Wilbur died of typhoid fever, and he died at home at Hawthorne Hill.

02:05.059 --> 02:13.552
And the bishop writes, the bishop was a prolific writer and publisher, editor of The Religious Telescope and other church publications.

02:15.254 --> 02:26.070
In this particular entry, he's talking about Wilbur passing away of typhoid fever, and he says, this morning at 315, Wilbur passed away, aged 45 years, one month, and 14 days,

02:26.557 --> 02:38.952
a short life full of consequences, an unfailing intellect, imperturbable temper, great self-reliance, and as great modesty, seeing the right clearly, pursuing it steadily, he lived and died.

02:39.613 --> 02:40.614
Wow.

02:40.634 --> 02:43.397
That's pretty controlled.

02:43.538 --> 02:46.942
It's very controlled and formal.

02:47.723 --> 02:53.930
When a parent is deceased like a child, it's a very well-tempered eulogy, isn't it?

02:53.950 --> 02:56.153
You'd like that on the day that he died.

02:56.193 --> 02:56.293
Yeah.

02:56.560 --> 02:58.302
A little more passionate.

02:58.322 --> 02:59.985
Well, yeah, me too.

03:00.245 --> 03:02.809
A couple days later, you see a little bit more emotion.

03:03.349 --> 03:05.112
Wilbur is dead and buried.

03:05.232 --> 03:07.174
This is Monday, June 2, 1912.

03:07.235 --> 03:08.476
He died a couple days.

03:08.496 --> 03:09.418
How about you reading it for me?

03:09.638 --> 03:10.880
Wilbur is dead and buried.

03:11.180 --> 03:12.281
We are all stricken.

03:12.862 --> 03:15.005
It does not seem possible that he is gone.

03:15.306 --> 03:18.330
Probably Orville and Catherine feel his loss most.

03:18.550 --> 03:20.813
They say little, many letters.

03:21.895 --> 03:24.458
Ezra Coons comes and reads Wilbur's will.

03:24.910 --> 03:25.871
and leaves coffee.

03:26.132 --> 03:28.735
I ride 20 miles with Orville in auto.

03:29.416 --> 03:32.320
Orville's first car was delivered the week that Wilbur died.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.624
And that summer, they went on lots of automobile rides.

03:35.664 --> 03:38.328
Was it a long illness, or did he just get sick and die?

03:38.588 --> 03:39.629
He got sick.

03:39.669 --> 03:46.418
He was in Boston working with lawyers with the patent suits in probably, if he died, the end of May, April.

03:46.859 --> 03:49.302
First came home, I think, ill in late April.

03:49.462 --> 03:51.525
So it was within a month, six weeks.

03:53.294 --> 03:58.461
Oh, I have to pose for a picture.

04:00.584 --> 04:04.590
But I'll be right out from you.

04:05.091 --> 04:07.434
We published the diaries at the Brook.

04:07.454 --> 04:09.137
I can give you one of those if you want.

04:09.157 --> 04:10.559
I call it my doorstop.

04:11.560 --> 04:14.665
It's an edited version of all the diary entries.

04:16.147 --> 04:20.533
Sometimes the bishop is a very descriptive writer, and other times he's very boring.

04:20.851 --> 04:22.995
He'll say he's working on his papers.

04:23.035 --> 04:25.520
Does he talk about reading or anything in there?

04:25.540 --> 04:26.061
Somewhat, yeah.

04:26.702 --> 04:31.151
He talks about publishing the religious telescope and troubles he's having with the church.

04:31.632 --> 04:37.223
He's a very controversial man in the church and caused a lot of trouble and a split at one point.

04:37.675 --> 04:40.038
I don't know if I need that.

04:40.058 --> 04:41.760
You're welcome to take one if you want.

04:41.800 --> 04:43.202
You could always mail one to me.

04:43.222 --> 04:44.063
That looks like that.

04:44.083 --> 04:45.185
Yeah, that's fine.

04:45.205 --> 04:46.787
We'd be happy to do that.

04:47.127 --> 04:49.350
This is our published guide to our collection.

04:49.490 --> 04:50.852
This is entirely online.

04:51.052 --> 04:51.372
Okay.

04:51.392 --> 04:52.994
So you could either take a copy of this.

04:53.014 --> 04:53.795
If it's online.

04:53.815 --> 04:54.116
It's online.

04:54.176 --> 04:54.677
That's fine.

04:54.917 --> 04:57.320
Yeah, this is just illustrated with photographs.

04:57.921 --> 05:00.544
Do you have a copy of this?

05:01.233 --> 05:03.958
This might be very helpful.

05:03.998 --> 05:06.362
You can take it.

05:06.382 --> 05:08.186
Get a better feel maybe for what's here.

05:08.246 --> 05:09.328
That would be good.

05:09.348 --> 05:11.071
I think something like that would be.

05:11.892 --> 05:13.796
And I can get that up and hold.

05:14.357 --> 05:14.878
If I need it.

05:17.182 --> 05:21.570
The other things here are albums that are full of wonderful photographs.

05:22.073 --> 05:23.635
of the Wright Brothers Flight.

05:23.875 --> 05:24.996
We're giving you a copy.

05:25.016 --> 05:28.861
We've reproduced the Red Album with McGraw-Hill as a copywriter.

05:28.881 --> 05:29.682
Oh, that's fabulous.

05:29.722 --> 05:30.863
Yeah, that's great, yeah.

05:30.883 --> 05:34.047
Do you want to take a look at, why don't I go get the list of books?

05:34.067 --> 05:35.148
Why don't you go do your picture?

05:35.308 --> 05:36.370
Okay, well, I don't want to.

05:36.390 --> 05:36.810
No, no worries.

05:36.830 --> 05:39.874
I can send somebody back with the list so that you can take a look.

05:39.934 --> 05:41.636
Okay, do you want to send somebody back with the list?

05:41.656 --> 05:42.657
Is that open then?

05:42.677 --> 05:43.438
Yeah, these are open.

05:43.458 --> 05:44.619
They're not locked.

05:44.639 --> 05:49.024
Just hit the top, and you can take a look at the kinds of things that they had in their library.

05:49.485 --> 05:50.486
Let me just put this stuff.

05:50.506 --> 05:51.287
No, okay.

05:57.494 --> 05:58.235
So you were saying?

06:00.118 --> 06:10.752
She was really, throughout Orville's life, of course, Orville survived Wilbur by many years.

06:10.772 --> 06:14.517
She was his companion, a helpmate, and a loyal sister.

06:15.258 --> 06:19.825
And near the end, when she was fairly old, and Dawn can amplify this, she knows much more about it than I do.

06:19.845 --> 06:26.033
I was telling about the rift that development laid between Orville and his sister when she decided to marry.

06:26.215 --> 06:26.655
Yeah.

06:26.836 --> 06:28.397
And he basically disowned her, right?

06:28.638 --> 06:30.039
That's a long story, yeah.

06:30.159 --> 06:30.500
Yeah.

06:30.940 --> 06:32.162
And then she died.

06:32.262 --> 06:34.324
She died not too long after that.

06:34.544 --> 06:36.346
Yeah.

06:36.427 --> 06:39.870
Well, Catherine had taken care of her family for so many years.

06:40.812 --> 06:41.753
They were very comfortable.

06:41.953 --> 06:44.776
Earl and Catherine were living in the Hawthorne Hill.

06:44.796 --> 06:50.783
She fell in love and got a marriage proposal and decided, you know, it's time for me to go off and have my own.

06:51.203 --> 06:51.824
And how old was she?

06:52.124 --> 06:53.005
She was in her 50s.

06:53.106 --> 06:53.706
Oh, really?

06:53.726 --> 06:53.987
Wow.

06:54.067 --> 06:55.328
Yeah.

06:55.848 --> 07:02.558
The gentleman she married was Terry Haskell, who was editor of the Kansas City Star, who had written some books and was very intelligent.

07:02.579 --> 07:03.580
He was a friend of Orville.

07:03.640 --> 07:05.643
They'd known him since Oberlin College days.

07:05.804 --> 07:06.905
He was a student at Oberlin.

07:06.925 --> 07:07.787
The captain was there.

07:08.748 --> 07:16.921
And she decided to get married, and she kept her secret from Orville for a month because she knew he would be furious when he found out, and he was.

07:17.983 --> 07:19.525
And she went ahead and left and got married.

07:19.545 --> 07:24.032
He did not attend the wedding, and he wouldn't speak to her or write to her.

07:24.468 --> 07:28.011
Lauren eventually convinced him to go to her when she was on her deathbed.

07:28.832 --> 07:30.994
And the family says she was already unconscious.

07:31.094 --> 07:33.036
Orville did go to Kansas City.

07:33.276 --> 07:34.017
But it was too late.

07:34.077 --> 07:36.199
She never knew he was there.

07:36.259 --> 07:37.800
That's a very sad story.

07:37.820 --> 07:38.881
It really is.

07:39.042 --> 07:41.604
Pretty spiteful in his pipe, if I may say.

07:41.824 --> 07:43.986
It doesn't speak very well of him.

07:44.086 --> 07:46.208
Yeah, that's the one thing I don't like about it.

07:46.228 --> 07:46.969
I'll be right back.

07:46.989 --> 07:47.710
I'm sorry.

07:48.530 --> 07:52.534
Yeah, that was... Yeah, so she's a very interesting...

07:52.835 --> 07:54.278
Very, very answering figure.

07:54.298 --> 07:59.206
Of course, she's the only one in the immediate family that's got a university education.

07:59.467 --> 07:59.747
Hmm.

08:01.110 --> 08:01.551
Interesting.

08:01.591 --> 08:01.951
Yeah.

08:02.312 --> 08:03.454
What did she major in, do you know?

08:03.594 --> 08:03.835
Education.

08:05.337 --> 08:05.918
Education.

08:05.938 --> 08:06.700
She's a teacher, yeah.

08:06.760 --> 08:08.002
Yeah, she became a school teacher.

08:08.022 --> 08:09.805
I don't know if they had education majors.

08:09.825 --> 08:10.827
Well, Oberlin...

08:11.127 --> 08:12.088
They trained a lot of teachers.

08:12.428 --> 08:12.769
Did they?

08:12.949 --> 08:14.030
Oh, yeah.

08:14.070 --> 08:21.438
They had a big statue on the campus there for missionaries who died in a box or we died in or something like that.

08:21.458 --> 08:22.680
Oh, is that right?

08:22.700 --> 08:30.428
Overland really has a great tradition of training teachers.

08:34.512 --> 08:34.793
Yeah.

08:35.113 --> 08:37.776
This is Psychology by William James.

08:38.650 --> 08:45.539
And it's an otherwise unremarkable, certainly not a first edition.

08:45.639 --> 08:46.821
It's 1812.

08:46.921 --> 08:47.582
It's 1893.

08:48.823 --> 08:49.985
Well, it might be the first, yeah.

08:50.005 --> 08:52.668
It's copyright 1892 by Henry Holt and Company.

08:52.688 --> 08:54.110
1892 there.

08:54.250 --> 08:57.434
Yeah, and it's got the date on the front, so it is.

08:58.195 --> 09:07.948
And again, it's from the private library of Orville Wright, but it bears the ownership, a very nice hand, signature of Catherine Wright,

09:08.873 --> 09:10.295
I'm going to find paste now.

09:10.335 --> 09:15.763
Maybe we'll take a picture of that.

09:15.783 --> 09:17.946
If we get something, we can just hold this, crop this up.

09:17.966 --> 09:20.109
Maybe you can hold it.

09:20.129 --> 09:21.071
Why don't you just hold it?

09:21.091 --> 09:21.792
Why don't you just hold it?

09:21.812 --> 09:22.733
Why don't you just hold it?

09:22.753 --> 09:25.377
I just don't see how she does have a nice hand.

09:25.577 --> 09:32.247
Don't you have a beautiful hand, sir?

09:32.267 --> 09:34.170
Oh, good enough.

09:34.190 --> 09:35.792
Let's just get the title page if we can.

09:36.262 --> 09:38.685
Well, she signed it again.

09:38.705 --> 09:39.627
She signed it twice.

09:40.388 --> 09:42.791
She's got a date, too.

09:42.811 --> 09:47.197
1896.

09:56.129 --> 09:56.890
Very good.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.033
Oh, yeah, she did.

09:59.213 --> 10:00.154
She read it.

10:00.414 --> 10:01.316
Read it in underlined.

10:01.336 --> 10:02.337
Blue console.

10:06.485 --> 10:08.948
Okay, what kinds of things is she underlining?

10:10.149 --> 10:11.590
The self, page 191.

10:12.691 --> 10:15.514
The wider material self.

10:16.676 --> 10:17.757
Men have arranged.

10:21.501 --> 10:23.102
Very careful reader, isn't she?

10:23.122 --> 10:23.222
Yeah.

10:23.242 --> 10:31.071
Let's see if she did any annotations in the back.

10:31.091 --> 10:32.492
Psychology.

10:33.637 --> 10:42.648
I think there are more books in the collection that don't have any cases, or more school books, I think.

10:42.668 --> 10:47.954
And it may even be the earlier generation, like this one, 1835, I'm not sure.

10:49.155 --> 10:51.238
Is that from their collection?

10:51.258 --> 10:51.738
Yes.

10:51.758 --> 10:54.702
I love that she signed that twice, not once, you know.

10:55.142 --> 10:55.683
Yeah.

10:55.723 --> 10:57.005
Very heavily annotated.

10:57.886 --> 10:59.948
Not annotated, but underlined.

11:05.176 --> 11:06.599
Yeah, she's annotated.

11:06.619 --> 11:10.266
I need to find when Don comes back that philosophy test.

11:10.286 --> 11:11.989
Yeah, I'd love to see that.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.638
Introduction to the study of philosophy.

11:16.658 --> 11:17.559
Yeah, and I don't know this.

11:17.579 --> 11:21.707
I have a PhD in philosophy, but I wasn't familiar with this guy.

11:21.727 --> 11:25.935
Let's see if she...

11:27.080 --> 11:50.218
oh here we go here we go oh okay yeah see okay so this even got her spring term so she was a student this was at uh this is the introduction to philosophy she's got spring term on there let me see let me see and then i think she's got something yeah

11:51.464 --> 11:53.726
It's not unlike any other student.

11:53.927 --> 11:54.047
Yeah.

11:54.067 --> 11:54.968
I mean, it's nothing to do.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.229
Look how wonderful hand.

11:56.249 --> 11:58.772
I don't believe remarkable, but I mean, it is interesting.

11:59.452 --> 12:02.175
She's kept these books.

12:02.195 --> 12:05.358
There's a doctor of divinity.

12:05.398 --> 12:08.481
Who's the author again?

12:08.662 --> 12:10.043
It's going to be here.

12:11.124 --> 12:19.293
And it looks like she did a lot of what philosophy is not.

12:19.593 --> 12:19.733
Mm-hmm.

12:20.607 --> 12:23.490
There's a lot of annotations in here.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.833
Let's see if she'd put anything at the end.

12:25.853 --> 12:26.834
Yeah, oh, here you go.

12:26.874 --> 12:28.595
You need to get that.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.358
Catherine has heavily annotated.

12:33.461 --> 12:34.221
Stuckenberg.

12:38.906 --> 12:40.648
Okay, what has she written there?

12:40.668 --> 12:44.612
Well, that's the... What is mine, no matter what is matter, never mind.

12:45.153 --> 12:48.977
You know, typical philosophy...

12:49.261 --> 12:50.302
But she's written that.

12:50.322 --> 12:51.144
What did she say again?

12:51.164 --> 12:52.545
Read it for me.

12:52.566 --> 12:53.327
What is mine?

12:53.347 --> 12:53.967
What is mine?

12:54.048 --> 12:54.608
No matter.

12:54.648 --> 12:55.249
No matter.

12:55.309 --> 12:55.910
What is matter?

12:56.190 --> 12:56.651
Never mind.

12:56.671 --> 12:57.232
That's great.

12:57.372 --> 12:58.974
And that's on the back page down.

12:59.215 --> 12:59.435
Right.

12:59.735 --> 13:01.918
Let me just get the right library down there, too.

13:01.938 --> 13:02.579
That's kind of cool.

13:03.761 --> 13:05.804
That could be any library.

13:05.944 --> 13:08.027
So we're identifying this, doesn't it?

13:08.047 --> 13:11.051
I see if she's got any other remarkable annotations.

13:11.071 --> 13:16.298
Well, she clearly read this for very...

13:16.666 --> 13:19.570
from beginning to end.

13:19.590 --> 13:23.255
I mean, it's underlined from beginning to end.

13:27.121 --> 13:32.288
And you have a PhD, you say, in philosophy, and you don't know the book, so it's really... I don't know the author.

13:33.190 --> 13:39.118
He's probably a guy that's done in the divinity schools, and he did the... That's a ninth edition, though.

13:39.158 --> 13:40.240
Did I just see that?

13:40.260 --> 13:42.142
Yeah, well... No, no, no, no, no.

13:42.162 --> 13:44.306
I thought that was a ninth.

13:44.326 --> 13:45.267
I was a CEO.

13:45.287 --> 13:46.048
He...

13:47.024 --> 13:50.730
It looks like a pretty standard, uh... What is she written back there?

13:50.750 --> 13:51.832
What's that say?

13:52.112 --> 13:52.913
Right there.

13:52.933 --> 13:53.194
Right there.

13:53.214 --> 13:54.175
Practical reform.

13:54.496 --> 13:54.596
Yeah.

13:55.598 --> 13:59.664
So she's probably a part of lectures, too, you know.

13:59.684 --> 13:59.844
Yeah.

14:03.911 --> 14:04.672
Interesting.

14:04.692 --> 14:05.754
Very, very interesting.

14:05.774 --> 14:06.114
Yeah, yeah.

14:06.134 --> 14:12.064
No, she, uh, but that's kind of the standard, standard breakout.

14:14.688 --> 14:14.888
This side.

14:16.471 --> 14:19.598
You know, Holocaust is a great philosophy.

14:19.618 --> 14:20.203
It's a private world.

14:21.179 --> 14:25.964
Oh, yeah, you do some of your research there?

14:25.984 --> 14:27.426
Yeah, well, it's just there.

14:27.446 --> 14:28.867
They give me full privileges.

14:28.907 --> 14:33.552
They're at the Clark, so between them, they've got a million books.

14:33.572 --> 14:37.657
Very rarely do I have to run into Harvard, you know.

14:37.857 --> 14:41.201
They do, yeah, the Jesuits, you know, they did great stuff.

14:41.221 --> 14:42.582
Yeah, it's really fine.

14:42.742 --> 14:43.623
It's a good school.

14:43.683 --> 14:44.825
No, the Holy Cross isn't Jesuits.

14:44.845 --> 14:46.967
There are brothers in the Holy Cross, actually.

14:47.285 --> 14:48.327
Are they Jesuits?

14:48.347 --> 14:49.950
No, they're not.

14:50.170 --> 14:51.332
No, they're not.

14:51.553 --> 14:56.101
But they, that place is a great reintroduction.

14:56.121 --> 14:58.205
I thought they were, but maybe they're not.

14:58.525 --> 14:59.607
How about Boston College?

14:59.627 --> 15:00.709
Boston College, definitely.

15:00.749 --> 15:02.412
They have the Jesuits.

15:02.492 --> 15:03.574
Yeah, Boston College.

15:03.674 --> 15:04.897
Yeah, I went to a Jesuit.

15:04.917 --> 15:08.483
Oh, you did, so you'd know that.

15:09.239 --> 15:11.823
You were talking about the orientation.

15:12.064 --> 15:12.785
Oh, yeah.

15:12.805 --> 15:17.513
Bird neighbors, an introduction, acquaintance with 150 of our common birds.

15:18.835 --> 15:19.556
Great.

15:19.576 --> 15:22.662
Let's take a picture of this one.

15:22.682 --> 15:23.343
You got it.

15:31.917 --> 15:35.263
Yeah, maybe the same experience.

15:37.150 --> 15:38.231
I don't want to handle this.

15:38.291 --> 15:42.496
Perhaps one of you could open it up to the annotations.

15:42.536 --> 15:45.840
Do you want this part?

15:46.061 --> 15:54.991
It's a list of the birds in the area, which is kind of cool.

15:55.011 --> 15:57.894
Maybe you can stick up the envelope that's addressed to her, too.

15:58.215 --> 15:59.657
Do you think these are her lists?

15:59.677 --> 16:00.457
I think it's her list.

16:00.978 --> 16:04.322
Her handwriting looks like her list.

16:07.137 --> 16:15.148
I know it.

16:16.570 --> 16:22.218
I know they were three cents when I was a kid.

16:23.179 --> 16:25.763
So she's just marking the birds that she's seen?

16:26.043 --> 16:26.364
Yeah, yep.

16:26.384 --> 16:29.528
There's some color plates.

16:30.189 --> 16:35.136
And again, does this have her ownership signature in it?

16:36.635 --> 16:37.656
And an envelope.

16:41.139 --> 16:43.321
Usually they would have found it.

16:43.441 --> 16:49.827
Yeah.

16:49.847 --> 16:51.188
Well, that's great.

16:51.208 --> 16:54.631
I don't think I shot 60 pictures on it.

16:55.292 --> 16:56.913
These digital cameras are distinct.

16:56.933 --> 16:59.375
You can keep going and going, huh?

16:59.436 --> 16:59.796
Yeah.

16:59.896 --> 17:00.396
I shot 60.

17:00.456 --> 17:01.597
I can go up to 280.

17:01.638 --> 17:02.638
You got 60 on there?

17:02.658 --> 17:04.140
I already shot 60 too.

17:04.160 --> 17:04.400
Well.

17:05.841 --> 17:06.642
Are there any more?

17:07.111 --> 17:08.813
of these books that you want to watch?

17:08.874 --> 17:10.115
No, I think it's great.

17:10.155 --> 17:10.756
I think we've covered it.

17:10.776 --> 17:11.598
Yeah, it's terrific.

17:11.618 --> 17:12.759
School books or anything?

17:13.100 --> 17:15.243
Yeah, that's okay.

17:15.323 --> 17:21.933
I've got enough here to really... Okay.

17:21.953 --> 17:26.019
...Huffman Field.

17:26.099 --> 17:35.953
Prairie is where they... It was a farmer's cow pasture, basically, and they rented it from Farmer Huffman, and their only requirement was to shoo the cows out of the field before they...

17:36.119 --> 17:40.267
And that's really the first practical flying was done.

17:40.327 --> 17:55.917
And they invented, not only did they invent the theoretical concepts and the physical plane, but they were the ones that, much to their personal danger, personal safety, discovered how to practically fly an airplane.

17:56.453 --> 17:59.837
If you want to, there might be nice, you could get some shots at this.

17:59.857 --> 18:01.339
It's a very compelling place.

18:01.359 --> 18:03.582
There's two signatures of photos in these books.

18:03.602 --> 18:04.704
I shoot off my phone.

18:05.304 --> 18:13.555
The other thing is, Don, is this story apocryphal about the undertaker who drove his wagon up there and waited?

18:14.997 --> 18:15.678
Somebody told me.

18:15.818 --> 18:16.559
I thought that was you.

18:16.599 --> 18:18.401
Oh, I think I did hear that.

18:18.562 --> 18:22.166
I don't think I told you that story.

18:22.186 --> 18:25.110
This is over in Orville at Huffman Prairie in 1904.

18:25.917 --> 18:28.080
Who knows what they're talking about?

18:28.540 --> 18:29.361
Who's shooting it?

18:29.381 --> 18:31.323
Are they carrying their own documentarian?

18:31.343 --> 18:32.004
It's their own camera.

18:32.024 --> 18:37.010
It's probably ... It might have been the brother who took the photograph.

18:37.030 --> 18:40.114
It could have been ... It's a very nicely composed photo.

18:40.254 --> 18:44.759
It's 16 ... It's 16.5.2.

18:45.040 --> 18:50.406
That's our ID number for it.

18:50.943 --> 18:54.809
A little over 2,000 photographs are online at our website.

18:54.829 --> 18:58.796
I have a brochure for you with a web address on it.

18:58.816 --> 19:02.401
And you can sit and look at pictures to your heart's content.

19:02.461 --> 19:06.267
That's a nicely composed photograph.

19:06.568 --> 19:08.170
He's got the whole fryer in there.

19:08.190 --> 19:09.653
He's got a nice casual.

19:10.154 --> 19:14.200
And you know they're posing because you don't have pretty fast explosions.

19:14.669 --> 19:15.910
Which is which?

19:17.012 --> 19:19.334
Wilbur's on the right, and Orville's on the left.

19:19.494 --> 19:21.977
Orville had a mustache, and Wilbur did not.

19:22.037 --> 19:23.279
That's the easiest way to remember.

19:23.299 --> 19:25.902
Do you have any shots with them up in the air?

19:26.282 --> 19:28.505
Yeah, yeah.

19:28.585 --> 19:32.809
Here's what the prairie looked like from the distance with the plane back there.

19:32.829 --> 19:34.311
These are all on your website, right?

19:34.491 --> 19:34.812
Yeah.

19:36.874 --> 19:38.676
And these all came from the family?

19:38.696 --> 19:38.956
Mm-hmm.

19:38.976 --> 19:40.278
And Elsie didn't want these.

19:40.718 --> 19:41.419
Are they crazy?

19:42.547 --> 19:44.430
I'm not going to tell that, are you?

19:44.550 --> 19:45.933
I'm astonished.

19:45.953 --> 19:47.135
The fire has taken off.

19:47.155 --> 19:47.936
It's in the air there.

19:47.956 --> 19:48.778
It's not very high.

19:49.058 --> 19:50.220
It's a lot.

19:50.260 --> 19:50.561
Look at it.

19:51.082 --> 19:54.247
Here's another one that's a little bit.

19:54.267 --> 19:57.753
Has anybody written about who's doing all the photography?

19:58.394 --> 20:00.938
There have been a couple articles done on the photography.

20:01.960 --> 20:04.484
I'll dig those out for you, and I can send those to you.

20:04.685 --> 20:05.306
That'd be good.

20:05.326 --> 20:06.107
Yeah, they'd be really good.

20:06.931 --> 20:16.766
We have a professor here at Wright State, Ron Guybert, who's done some studying of the photography, as well as Jeff Johns here at Wright State, and there's a UD professor.

20:16.786 --> 20:20.010
Are these now, were they like glass negatives?

20:20.030 --> 20:21.172
Yes.

20:21.192 --> 20:24.357
And so they were in fact negatives.

20:24.637 --> 20:24.878
Mm-hmm.

20:25.358 --> 20:28.603
And that's, I think that's a very, is that the famous one?

20:28.623 --> 20:29.324
That's here again.

20:29.344 --> 20:32.629
That's here.

20:32.669 --> 20:35.233
They spent hours, hours flying around us.

20:36.462 --> 20:40.326
And that's where he did his figure eights.

20:43.951 --> 21:02.171
Wilbur never lives to see the application of World War I. These are wonderful.

21:02.592 --> 21:03.213
I'll trade you.

21:03.793 --> 21:05.355
These are 1905.

21:05.555 --> 21:10.722
And this is when they're actually flying in circles around the field.

21:10.742 --> 21:14.828
Think about what I find so extraordinary, because these guys are, no one has done this before.

21:14.848 --> 21:15.990
Look how high up they are.

21:16.070 --> 21:18.974
I mean, there's not a manual on how to fly and safety.

21:18.994 --> 21:22.359
I mean, how many times did they crash a bunch of times?

21:22.379 --> 21:23.701
Oh, they had so many mishaps.

21:23.721 --> 21:24.261
It's amazing.

21:24.281 --> 21:30.831
Well, the normal didn't die before they... We have one rather unusual and unique item.

21:30.871 --> 21:32.473
We do have the...

21:33.247 --> 21:40.581
We do have the x-ray of Orville's broken leg in our archives.

21:41.683 --> 21:42.485
These are wonderful.

21:42.505 --> 21:44.148
And these are all original prints, right?

21:44.288 --> 21:46.793
Most of them, yeah.

21:46.813 --> 21:47.574
They might be.

21:47.594 --> 21:48.677
Did they keep their necks?

21:48.837 --> 21:49.739
I mean, the glass plates?

21:50.300 --> 21:54.027
The glass plates of these photographs are at the library.

21:54.047 --> 21:55.710
I'll see you took the plates.

21:56.382 --> 21:57.544
That's a beautiful picture.

21:58.205 --> 21:58.545
Yeah.

21:58.605 --> 21:59.566
Wonderful photographer.

21:59.607 --> 22:03.592
Robert Cummish has put all those flash plates online, so you can look at it.

22:03.612 --> 22:05.074
Let's look at that picture.

22:05.094 --> 22:06.877
There it is.

22:06.897 --> 22:07.938
Yeah, it's lens, too.

22:07.998 --> 22:09.000
Pretty sharp, you know.

22:11.163 --> 22:11.483
It's amazing.

22:11.904 --> 22:12.905
It's really wonderful.

22:14.167 --> 22:17.291
You know, we could keep you busy for hours in here.

22:17.532 --> 22:21.717
Oh, I think so.

22:21.998 --> 22:25.663
One part of the collection that's really remarkable is all the European photos.

22:25.897 --> 22:27.539
of Italy and Germany and France.

22:28.360 --> 22:36.329
Yesterday we had visitors here from Pau, France, where Wilbur flew in 1908 and they were just fascinated.

22:36.349 --> 22:40.414
Maybe you'd like to see... We have their calling card collection.

22:41.935 --> 22:43.657
And it's like a who's who.

22:43.677 --> 22:44.218
I'll bet.

22:45.219 --> 22:51.747
Sure.

22:51.767 --> 22:54.590
I don't know what it actually has.

22:54.610 --> 22:54.790
It's a...

22:56.643 --> 23:05.815
President Taft, this is a great shot here.

23:05.835 --> 23:07.477
Wow.

23:07.497 --> 23:08.879
Look at that, huh?

23:08.999 --> 23:10.762
And that's Catherine.

23:10.782 --> 23:17.631
This is 1909, and they're being presented at the Aero Club of America meeting at the White House.

23:17.651 --> 23:20.815
And that's the Ohio president right there?

23:21.255 --> 23:21.396
Mm-hmm.

23:22.998 --> 23:23.258
Great.

23:23.474 --> 23:45.246
they say that he's thin in this picture he's not much bigger as he got older looks like a pretty stuck sturdy guy right there this is um there's two boxes full of these these are in alphabetical order but these are business calling cards like duval la chapelle was one of the pilots the rights train frank long was another one of the pilots um

23:45.496 --> 23:53.625
What was so much fun yesterday, as the French people went through this, they recognized the names of a lot of these people, and there's a story to go with every single name in here.

23:53.645 --> 23:55.247
Oh, sure.

23:55.547 --> 23:58.511
Look at this.

23:58.531 --> 24:01.274
Georges Amoyer, the engineering council, I guess.

24:01.895 --> 24:07.982
They met the heads of state of Europe, prominent businessmen, inventors.

24:09.784 --> 24:15.250
I mean, a lot of French names, and they all gave their colors, didn't they?

24:16.445 --> 24:18.307
They kept them all, too.

24:18.547 --> 24:22.591
There's a few at the back.

24:22.611 --> 24:24.433
We have Wilbur and Orville's cards.

24:25.233 --> 24:26.094
We don't have too many of them.

24:28.136 --> 24:31.379
This stuff today, you see, I wrote a little bit about this one in my books.

24:31.399 --> 24:34.302
I mean, the material artifact today is so important.

24:36.984 --> 24:37.985
This is really it.

24:38.166 --> 24:39.046
Here we go.

24:40.067 --> 24:43.971
Here's Loewenwright's card, their brother.

24:44.440 --> 24:47.325
Um, Orville Wright is his card.

24:47.605 --> 24:48.727
What is Orville's card?

24:48.747 --> 24:50.690
He's Wilbur's.

24:50.710 --> 24:50.910
Oh, wow.

24:50.930 --> 24:52.773
Bruce Leonard is one of their oldest brothers.

24:55.437 --> 24:57.601
The calling card is just a whole story in itself.

24:57.621 --> 24:58.142
Yeah, it sure is.

24:58.162 --> 25:00.265
Of people that they met throughout their careers.

25:02.629 --> 25:03.911
Is that his signature?

25:03.931 --> 25:05.573
Mm-hmm.

25:05.714 --> 25:11.783
Of course, uh, we did on an auction, this is our national auction, and we did about two weeks ago for an Orville Wright letter.

25:12.164 --> 25:12.304
Mm-hmm.

25:13.448 --> 25:21.499
We were outbid, and eventually, beyond our capacity, the letter went for over $10,000.

25:21.560 --> 25:23.602
And one writes currently today.

25:23.863 --> 25:26.306
We have to do that today.

25:26.607 --> 25:28.389
The Wilbur Wright letter that's being offered.

25:28.409 --> 25:31.073
Well, we're thinking it'll probably go for around $15,000.

25:31.333 --> 25:33.196
Now, who's Wilbur L. Wright, M.D.?

25:33.737 --> 25:34.478
We're not sure.

25:34.498 --> 25:35.760
I don't think it's a relative.

25:36.260 --> 25:38.263
I think it's just a coincidence.

25:38.283 --> 25:39.525
Somebody, yeah.

25:39.545 --> 25:42.890
And they thought it was kind of cool, and they put it in the collection?

25:42.910 --> 25:43.050
Mm-hmm.

25:44.228 --> 25:45.270
Yeah, fascinating.

25:45.851 --> 25:53.583
We get a lot of requests from people who say, my grandmother told me I was related to the White Butters.

25:53.603 --> 25:58.230
Well, you take a look up in your White Butters genealogy to figure out if we're related.

25:59.712 --> 26:01.275
Most of the time, of course, it's not.

26:01.295 --> 26:02.236
They're not.

26:02.877 --> 26:05.281
It's not an uncommon name, I'm sure, too.

26:05.341 --> 26:05.702
Yeah.

26:07.264 --> 26:10.810
This particular album goes along with the events

26:11.127 --> 26:12.689
in the photograph here.

26:12.709 --> 26:16.996
This is kind of a souvenir album, and these medals were presented.

26:17.317 --> 26:18.759
Arrow Club of America medals.

26:22.645 --> 26:31.519
The Arrow Club of America officials and CAFT and some of the other dignitaries of the time wrote letters of recognition to the Reich.

26:31.779 --> 26:35.044
Here's Augustus Post, who was at the Arrow Club of America.

26:36.326 --> 26:38.890
Kind of a scrapbook of

26:39.511 --> 26:42.035
testimonials or congratulatory letters.

26:42.596 --> 26:42.976
1908.

26:43.937 --> 26:47.222
It's amazing how quickly things started to happen, isn't it?

26:47.242 --> 26:48.424
Mm-hmm.

26:48.444 --> 26:49.526
It's a beautiful certificate.

26:49.546 --> 26:51.028
Look at that.

26:51.348 --> 26:54.032
That's really fabulous, isn't it?

26:54.052 --> 26:54.293
Mm-hmm.

26:54.353 --> 26:58.619
There's, like, a reproduction of this photograph.

26:58.639 --> 27:04.067
I like it.

27:04.840 --> 27:06.101
Is this their scrapbook?

27:06.782 --> 27:09.224
This has been pretty nice, very neatly put together.

27:09.444 --> 27:11.105
Who do you suppose did this for them?

27:11.125 --> 27:11.846
The Aero Club.

27:11.866 --> 27:12.226
Oh, the Aero Club.

27:12.246 --> 27:12.967
Probably, yeah.

27:13.087 --> 27:16.310
Here's the same photograph, and maybe other people will find it.

27:16.330 --> 27:18.712
Robert Wright, Orville Wright, Catherine Wright.

27:18.832 --> 27:19.152
Wow.

27:19.292 --> 27:22.035
You wonder what something like that would go for at auction, you know?

27:22.235 --> 27:22.695
Thousands.

27:24.637 --> 27:25.598
Unbelievable, right?

27:25.618 --> 27:25.918
Yeah.

27:25.938 --> 27:29.201
And this came from the... This is a part of their personal collection.

27:29.261 --> 27:34.105
It was probably presented to them as a souvenir of the occasion of this...

27:34.540 --> 27:35.621
The awarding of the medal.

27:37.484 --> 27:42.310
That's very nice.

27:42.350 --> 27:43.552
Hold it up a little bit.

27:43.772 --> 27:46.636
I think it's going to be a little distorted.

27:46.656 --> 27:47.057
That's good.

27:47.077 --> 27:47.678
A little more, maybe.

27:48.258 --> 27:55.047
That's good.

27:55.067 --> 27:56.329
That's perfect.

27:59.397 --> 28:00.098
My new toy.

28:00.118 --> 28:04.061
I never thought I'd go digital until I got it.

28:04.081 --> 28:04.522
Really?

28:04.542 --> 28:05.703
I'll have to get it.

28:05.723 --> 28:07.424
Yeah, this is the new one, the new Nikon.

28:07.444 --> 28:08.365
It just came out in April.

28:08.986 --> 28:09.846
I really wanted one.

28:09.866 --> 28:11.047
It's a single lens reflex.

28:11.067 --> 28:13.910
So I can change, put all my Nikon lenses on this.

28:14.230 --> 28:14.370
Right.

28:14.390 --> 28:16.392
300 millimeter and it's done.

28:16.412 --> 28:17.553
So I got a camera.

28:17.613 --> 28:19.935
Yeah.

28:19.955 --> 28:20.476
Fabulous.

28:21.737 --> 28:21.997
Let's see.

28:22.017 --> 28:24.179
What else could be shown here in the clip?

28:24.199 --> 28:26.801
Orville Botany's sketchbook.

28:26.821 --> 28:27.222
Sure.

28:27.242 --> 28:27.582
Want to see that?

28:28.085 --> 28:29.927
And then that brings us up to like 11.20.

28:29.987 --> 28:55.131
Yeah, yeah.

28:55.151 --> 28:55.712
I'll get my memory out here.

28:55.732 --> 28:55.932
Thank you.

29:04.720 --> 29:05.762
Plant Notes, 1887?

29:05.902 --> 29:06.262
Mm-hmm.

29:06.302 --> 29:06.603
All right.

29:07.023 --> 29:09.567
All right.

29:09.667 --> 29:11.670
And how old do you suppose he is at this point?

29:11.710 --> 29:12.311
He was born in 71.

29:12.331 --> 29:14.074
He was a kid.

29:14.795 --> 29:14.995
Yeah.

29:15.656 --> 29:16.137
Teenager.

29:18.540 --> 29:20.463
Here's his drawing of the sassafras.

29:25.150 --> 29:26.151
Yeah, sure.

29:26.171 --> 29:30.778
Can you lay it flat?

29:43.162 --> 29:45.984
He wasn't a bad artist.

29:46.065 --> 29:47.406
Look at that, huh?

29:47.466 --> 29:49.407
That's actually drawn by hand.

29:59.376 --> 29:59.516
Uh-huh.

29:59.536 --> 30:01.498
There he is.

30:01.518 --> 30:08.064
Now, is this down in conjunction with school, do you figure out?

30:08.084 --> 30:08.544
Uh-huh, yeah.

30:08.964 --> 30:11.987
These are from Richmond High School.

30:13.486 --> 30:19.254
class of 84, and here Wilbur Wright is the high school's cyclopedia.

30:19.274 --> 30:25.142
He must have done some sort of recitation or something, well, no, that's music dividing these recitations probably.

30:26.584 --> 30:28.287
But Orville never finished high school?

30:28.307 --> 30:34.275
I thought Orville had, I thought he graduated with Paul Dunbar, but... Nope, Dunbar graduated, but Orville didn't.

30:34.295 --> 30:35.317
Orville did not graduate.

30:35.417 --> 30:36.899
No, he dropped out.

30:37.420 --> 30:38.541
The high school dropped out.

30:38.842 --> 30:41.265
Did he say he was a voracious reader?

30:41.617 --> 30:44.081
It's the best of my knowledge, yeah.

30:44.402 --> 30:46.806
Well, Father's influence undoubtedly.

30:46.826 --> 30:53.057
I think Wilbur probably read more than Orville, but... But the book's all there, the Orville, right?

30:53.077 --> 30:54.139
Of course, Wilbur died young.

30:54.159 --> 30:57.545
Yeah, Wilbur died until the books were all in Orville's library.

30:57.565 --> 30:58.927
Yeah, right, exactly.

30:58.947 --> 30:59.929
A side story.

31:00.601 --> 31:29.983
you see some mud and dirt on here in 1913 in march dayton had a huge flood flood mud from 1913 they didn't get tossed which is good yeah they're muddy you know the um the glass plate negative and many of the photographs were in the shed behind the hawkling street house here in dayton not the house you'll see today with the original home when the flood happened the flood waters flooded the whole first floor of the house and the shed

31:30.655 --> 31:36.880
Luckily, the glass plates were not damaged, very little damaged, and survived.

31:37.020 --> 31:41.644
I mean, that flood could have potentially wiped out all photographs that we have.

31:42.525 --> 31:44.587
So, pretty remarkable.

31:44.967 --> 31:45.728
Yeah, it is.

31:45.988 --> 31:48.530
Yeah, that flood was really catastrophic.

31:49.531 --> 32:00.240
And you know, Henry Ford came down to Dayton at 36, and took the bicycle shop in the original White House, and they're now in Greenfield.

32:00.625 --> 32:21.334
But if you go there, Ford took those buildings and, you know, they're wonderful, but the Wright brothers, it's interesting because the whole

32:22.293 --> 32:27.601
history and support for the Wright Brothers' legacy and all of that is fairly recent here.

32:27.621 --> 32:29.704
It seems to be a whole lot of interesting.

32:29.724 --> 32:41.162
The report came down, of course, 1936, because the area

32:41.513 --> 32:44.437
The area wasn't supporting it.

32:44.477 --> 32:58.754
The area wasn't supporting it in the West 3rd Street, where they're kind of in now.

33:00.877 --> 33:02.639
They're doing some restoration.

33:02.719 --> 33:03.841
They've rebuilt some of that.

33:03.861 --> 33:05.903
You can go get on it.

33:06.163 --> 33:09.087
They rebuilt the bicycle shop.

33:09.207 --> 33:11.470
It's very nice to see them.

33:12.175 --> 33:14.120
I'm all for that.

33:14.501 --> 33:27.973
I think this has been very successful.
