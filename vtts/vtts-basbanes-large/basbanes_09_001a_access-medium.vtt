WEBVTT

00:02.933 --> 00:06.118
Steph, okay, we're talking, and you wanted to start with Serrat.

00:06.138 --> 00:25.768
Yeah, I just wanted to tell you that, and you can put all this together according to your own lights, you can just ask what you want, and I'll just hand it, but I'm just going to say that I was interested in the kind of a pointeous technique of writing the essay, because if I made it overly formal, you know, highly sequential or chronological, these three essays, it wouldn't

00:35.097 --> 00:51.037
So that was a point I just wanted to make, that I had that ambition, because like a mosaic, if you stand too close to it, it may be looking at one little bit of smalto or stone, and not quite see the figure in the copper, or to change the metaphor, or the design of the mosaic.

00:51.337 --> 00:57.765
But I think when you stand back, and Kirkus Review complained that it was just an aggregation of facts, and I don't think they read it well.

00:58.226 --> 01:00.649
But my point is that if you stand back, you'll see

01:01.102 --> 01:03.545
Is that what Kirkus said?

01:03.926 --> 01:06.949
They'll probably say that about my book then.

01:07.009 --> 01:09.913
They said, overstuffed like all his writing.

01:10.454 --> 01:12.256
What did they say?

01:12.276 --> 01:14.439
Overstuffed like all his novels.

01:14.479 --> 01:16.241
I mean, the person hated me.

01:17.022 --> 01:20.106
Kirkus is a nasty place, you know?

01:20.126 --> 01:20.626
It really is.

01:20.686 --> 01:22.809
There were pains in the ass.

01:23.410 --> 01:29.117
So anyway, to answer that question, that was that ambition.

01:29.587 --> 01:30.768
How did it start?

01:30.888 --> 01:36.933
I actually wrote an article for Art and Antiques about four or five years ago on the color blue.

01:36.953 --> 01:39.616
I got this idea of just writing the history of a color.

01:40.416 --> 01:47.082
And I wasn't talking about a formal art, you know, a chronological history, because, again, I didn't want to descend to the formulaic.

01:47.923 --> 01:58.412
So I just started thinking in a kind of subjective way about the connections of colors, of dyes, of lapis lazuli, and then it was a beautifully illustrated

01:58.949 --> 01:59.750
article.

02:00.932 --> 02:05.559
It was called Rhapsody in Blue, and it got more mail than any article in the history of that magazine.

02:06.000 --> 02:13.291
So I talked with the editor at the time, Jeffrey Scheer, and said, you know, I should do something.

02:13.632 --> 02:15.795
Several people wrote it and said he should do something on a color red.

02:16.156 --> 02:18.600
So I just started tallying up things on yellow.

02:19.601 --> 02:20.583
But you know, it's interesting.

02:20.803 --> 02:24.028
You know the gas on Being Blue book, but

02:24.717 --> 02:29.505
But I was telling someone the other day that, you know, I don't know if you know Aurobor, the Wiesman novel.

02:31.488 --> 02:33.451
How do you spell it?

02:33.471 --> 02:34.352
So I won't label it.

02:34.372 --> 02:36.656
Wiesman, H-U-Y-S-M-A-N-S.

02:36.716 --> 02:38.238
He's a French novelist.

02:38.639 --> 02:41.363
And Aurobor, I translate in English against the grain.

02:42.345 --> 02:44.608
You know, it's a classic, decadent novel.

02:44.649 --> 02:45.971
Oscar Wilde loved it.

02:46.892 --> 02:48.054
Well, I won't sum up the novel.

02:48.114 --> 02:51.940
But briefly, it's about a decadent character named Desassins.

02:52.477 --> 02:57.127
And he, at one point, throws a party where everything's black.

02:57.247 --> 03:05.525
The food is black, black radishes, the plates are black, the meal is served by negresses naked.

03:05.766 --> 03:08.211
So there's really an essay on black there.

03:08.291 --> 03:12.240
And then I was thinking Melville's Moby Dick, you know, their great essay on white.

03:13.030 --> 03:19.296
And so really there's a kind of, I think there's a kind of genre, almost a sub-genre in the artistic mind.

03:19.376 --> 03:21.538
What a collection that would make.

03:21.558 --> 03:22.199
Absolutely.

03:22.259 --> 03:29.026
I've thought of that, and I've also thought of... Unique, really.

03:29.326 --> 03:31.128
Yeah, it would.

03:31.408 --> 03:32.830
There's probably someone that collects them.

03:32.850 --> 03:33.811
Benjamin Moore would be the kind of collection.

03:33.831 --> 03:34.471
Yeah, that's right.

03:34.872 --> 03:36.613
I mentioned Benjamin Moore in there.

03:36.713 --> 03:37.134
Yeah, you did.

03:37.154 --> 03:39.236
That's why I mentioned the blue in your bedroom.

03:39.516 --> 03:39.696
Yeah.

03:39.756 --> 03:42.379
Do you know, I was once going to do it... Do you think of the number?

03:42.545 --> 03:56.178
I was going to give an anthology one time, do an anthology of inaccessible literature, books and essays and stories and novels that are impossible to read.

03:56.638 --> 04:01.943
Like Henry James wrote a short story called The Bench of Desolation, which is almost impossible to read.

04:02.004 --> 04:05.006
I would put Parts of Gravity's Rainbow in there.

04:05.126 --> 04:06.648
I think it's almost impossible.

04:06.668 --> 04:10.932
Do you know anybody besides yourself possibly who's read Spencer's The Fairy Queen?

04:11.182 --> 04:15.509
Well, but Spencer's the Fairy Queen is lucid compared to Meridus the Egoist.

04:15.529 --> 04:16.671
Well, I'm saying it's great unread books.

04:16.811 --> 04:20.837
No, well, unread books is one category, but I'm talking about books that you cannot enter.

04:20.857 --> 04:21.639
But you can't find it.

04:21.699 --> 04:22.500
Yeah, that you can't find it.

04:22.520 --> 04:23.902
It would be an interesting anthology.

04:24.163 --> 04:30.112
By the way, getting back to Isaiah Thomas, I bet there's not a statue to Isaiah Thomas in Worcester.

04:30.132 --> 04:31.695
But there's a memorial in the antiquary.

04:31.715 --> 04:36.442
But do you know there's not a statue to Poe in Boston, but there's one to Curley in Red Auerbach?

04:36.903 --> 04:37.003
What?

04:37.338 --> 04:40.742
There's not one to Lydia Maria Child in Medford or Over the River and Through the Woods.

04:40.762 --> 04:45.286
I don't know, it gets my goat that we treat our artists so poorly in this country.

04:45.527 --> 04:55.677
You know where there is a statue in England, and it's so wonderful, and Robert Giroux mentioned this to me, I wouldn't know it, but there's actually a little statue to Hemings and Cardinal who published Shakespeare's book.

04:55.697 --> 04:56.378
Well, there should be.

04:56.458 --> 04:57.680
Isn't that wonderful?

04:57.780 --> 05:00.843
But not surprising, because it's a place where they would do that.

05:01.243 --> 05:02.805
But to the men who...

05:03.663 --> 05:09.976
Very little else is known about them, except for the fact that they preserved Shakespeare's works.

05:10.477 --> 05:11.559
No, but they were significant.

05:12.822 --> 05:15.347
And yet we have the Silvio Conti Forum.

05:15.668 --> 05:17.211
We have the Tom O'Neil building.

05:17.291 --> 05:22.222
But we don't have—you know, that's a real thing, because the politicians hold the keys.

05:22.883 --> 05:23.865
They're the bursas.

05:25.263 --> 05:28.527
They did erect a statue of Samuel William Morrison.

05:28.547 --> 05:29.849
Yeah, but as well they should have.

05:29.869 --> 05:31.131
I mean, he was an important man.

05:31.431 --> 05:33.434
Which is interesting now that I think about it.

05:33.494 --> 05:35.897
I wrote a long piece on him for Art and Antiques, too.

05:36.738 --> 05:40.443
In fact, when I was leaving, he said, you can take a book from this library.

05:40.664 --> 05:49.015
And he gave me a copy of The Courtship of Miles Standish, signed by Longfellow.

05:49.095 --> 05:53.561
I did this interview just before he died, a couple of years before he died, yeah.

05:53.621 --> 05:54.983
His secretary called him Admiral.

05:55.823 --> 05:57.205
born in the house he lived in.

05:57.625 --> 05:58.046
It was 87.

05:58.066 --> 06:01.771
You know, he remembers seeing Phillips Brooks give a sermon.

06:02.412 --> 06:05.115
He saw Lillian Russell in Copley Square.

06:06.317 --> 06:14.989
He used to gallop from his house in Brimmer Street to Harvard by horse, cross the Harvard Bridge, put the exams in the – gallop into the Harvard Yacht.

06:15.549 --> 06:16.190
Morrison did.

06:16.210 --> 06:17.071
Morrison did.

06:17.091 --> 06:19.154
In the late – He was an old fellow, wasn't he?

06:19.234 --> 06:19.855
He was 87.

06:19.935 --> 06:24.261
And, you know, we're talking 1910s.

06:24.764 --> 06:28.810
Do you know his book, One Boy's Boston?

06:29.351 --> 06:31.414
One of the best books in Boston, just anecdotes.

06:32.035 --> 06:34.760
But then he put the exams in and galloped back to Boston.

06:35.240 --> 06:36.262
Let's go back to colors.

06:37.344 --> 06:38.085
Primary colors.

06:38.546 --> 06:40.048
This could have been endless.

06:40.529 --> 06:43.253
It's interesting that this book has never been written before.

06:43.994 --> 06:46.778
The primary colors, because it's the perfect book of essays.

06:46.838 --> 06:52.307
I'm not speaking about myself having done it, but just the idea of writing essays on colors blue, red, and yellow.

06:53.131 --> 07:06.733
I would be interested in why Gass only did the color blue, but the color blue is a beckoning, wonderful, magical color, and has a lot of interesting literary associations that he tapped.

07:07.134 --> 07:13.223
I read it years ago, but made a point of not reading it, and haven't since when it was first published by Godin.

07:13.243 --> 07:17.009
So it started with the piece that you did for Arts and Antiques.

07:17.029 --> 07:18.632
Art and Antiques, yeah.

07:19.507 --> 07:21.470
And, of course, the reaction, the response to that.

07:21.490 --> 07:27.679
It was big, and I'm writing another novel, so I did this kind of with my left hand.

07:27.719 --> 07:32.406
I don't mean to say it wasn't important to me, but it was a kind of easy book to write, to compile.

07:33.047 --> 07:42.201
Again, though, a lot of people think I did compile it, which is hurtful, because I think there's a lot of the poetic... It is hurtful, because I was reading it to see.

07:42.261 --> 07:45.025
I know when you pick up stuff... Yeah.

07:45.140 --> 07:51.710
If you're compiling, you tend to pick up the idiomatic structure of the person picking it up.

07:51.730 --> 07:54.775
There is a seamless quality to the writing.

07:55.075 --> 07:57.800
The hamburger all came through the same machine.

07:57.820 --> 07:59.923
Yes, that's right, and I was mindful of that.

07:59.943 --> 08:05.271
I was aware to that when I was reading it, so I do feel that there is a threat.

08:05.652 --> 08:08.777
There's a coherence to it all.

08:08.977 --> 08:10.860
What do you see?

08:11.313 --> 08:13.958
Give me a linear track.

08:14.078 --> 08:24.716
I'll tell you the coherence should be the coordinate established between the mind of the writer and the curious mind of the reader.

08:25.538 --> 08:27.501
That's what I would say to answer that question.

08:27.541 --> 08:30.807
It would be that there are people that abhor intellection.

08:31.175 --> 08:35.863
that would be your book and say... Is that word that your invention, by the way?

08:35.883 --> 08:36.604
No, intellection?

08:37.105 --> 08:40.451
No, that's a legitimate word, yeah.

08:40.511 --> 08:43.696
Why did he bother all this bibliographical matter?

08:43.716 --> 08:45.039
What's the point of that anecdote?

08:45.199 --> 08:46.902
Who gives a shit about the Caliph Omar?

08:47.202 --> 08:51.430
But the point is, the intellectually curious is my reader.

08:51.730 --> 08:56.338
Nabarkov once was asked whom he wrote for, and he said, I look out to your

08:56.538 --> 09:00.704
I look out there and see a lot of little Nabokov, faces of a lot of little Nabokov.

09:00.724 --> 09:03.548
Is that what he said?

09:03.569 --> 09:03.669
Yeah.

09:04.450 --> 09:10.719
But I've been working on a novel about Amelia Earhart and me and Medford my hometown.

09:10.779 --> 09:13.183
I think at least two out of the three essays.

09:13.684 --> 09:18.411
Have you ever seen any of her – I'm interested here – we'll talk about that after the interview.

09:19.993 --> 09:23.338
Anything about her I'd be curious about?

09:24.044 --> 09:31.374
I have a pilot's license I haven't flown in years, so I am interested in anything with flight.

09:31.394 --> 09:32.516
She was not a great pilot.

09:32.596 --> 09:33.497
Absolutely right.

09:33.718 --> 09:36.321
That's bullshit that she was... Absolutely right.

09:36.822 --> 09:40.727
She got the best of the training and everything like that.

09:40.747 --> 09:47.277
She flew across the ocean, but she... She took a truck with her as a goddamn navigator.

09:47.337 --> 09:47.897
Well, that's right.

09:47.917 --> 09:49.039
That was a mistake.

09:49.188 --> 09:51.050
But you're right about that.

09:51.070 --> 09:52.351
She was not... She was good.

09:52.372 --> 09:52.912
She was adequate.

09:53.092 --> 09:54.594
Yeah, but she crashed her plane a lot.

09:54.774 --> 09:55.895
She was not Charles Lindbergh.

09:55.915 --> 09:57.297
She was not the female Charles Lindbergh.

09:57.317 --> 09:58.638
No, nothing near it.

09:58.658 --> 10:00.761
Charles Lindbergh brought the spirit of St.

10:00.781 --> 10:01.101
Louis.

10:01.141 --> 10:04.305
He made his land flow within a half a degree of his dead record.

10:04.325 --> 10:05.646
And she was 200 miles off.

10:05.806 --> 10:06.527
Unbelievable.

10:06.787 --> 10:08.850
She thought she was in Kansas or something.

10:08.950 --> 10:09.691
Well, no, no.

10:09.731 --> 10:12.273
She wanted to land in Paris and she landed in an island.

10:13.255 --> 10:13.955
Something like that.

10:13.975 --> 10:16.618
But when she flew across the country, she was down here.

10:16.758 --> 10:19.161
Yeah, she crashed her plane a lot and all, but...

10:19.850 --> 10:20.831
She was a brave woman.

10:20.851 --> 10:23.273
She was more brave and talented and pretty.

10:23.774 --> 10:24.575
But anyway, back to this.

10:24.595 --> 10:26.297
So I want to just, because I just want to answer the question.

10:26.637 --> 10:31.642
So I can, you see, I think a lot of the anti-intellectuals are out there.

10:31.982 --> 10:37.368
And a lot of the intellectuals say, a lot of, I think someone actually did tell Alan Peacock, why, what's the point?

10:37.728 --> 10:38.329
What's the point?

10:38.709 --> 10:41.132
And I say, what's the fucking point of Hamlet?

10:41.152 --> 10:42.633
What's the point of butterflies?

10:42.893 --> 10:43.774
What's the point, you know?

10:43.974 --> 10:46.297
He had the same opposition.

10:46.317 --> 10:48.439
He had major oppositions in my book at home.

10:48.790 --> 10:50.492
Because they said, nobody in the chains.

10:50.632 --> 10:52.574
We're not going to sell it to the chains.

10:52.594 --> 10:54.256
And to his credit, he said, fuck the chains.

10:54.396 --> 10:54.697
Yeah.

10:55.678 --> 10:59.362
But the sad thing is, that's one problem.

10:59.382 --> 11:01.024
But then they're going to do the book.

11:01.644 --> 11:12.917
But you're going to be very disheartened when and if, and I hope it doesn't happen, as I will be, when people get the book and don't care about the aggregation of knowledge that's used.

11:13.958 --> 11:17.262
In the same way, in my opinion, and here would be my analogy,

11:17.377 --> 11:25.369
is cooking a lovely dinner, centerpiece, a chicken masala, whatever, and the person drives away and says, who does he think he is?

11:26.210 --> 11:27.031
All that stuff.

11:27.212 --> 11:35.304
And did you notice that sherbet, flambe, who, you know, instead of saying, what a wonderful, Nick was a wonderful cook, that was a wonderful dinner.

11:35.824 --> 11:36.706
That's the difference.

11:37.367 --> 11:44.397
So there are people that just, so I consider that an aspect of anti-electualism, but I've never really cared much about readers anyway,

11:44.663 --> 11:48.551
I have my ideal reader, and I was kind of writing to that person.

11:49.533 --> 11:50.175
Little Alex?

11:51.097 --> 11:53.562
Little Faces of Alex.

11:53.722 --> 11:56.949
Tell me a little bit about the essay.

11:57.089 --> 12:03.162
I think maybe I'm trying to formulate how I'm going to write my piece.

12:03.310 --> 12:08.577
And, you know, I think it's ages since I've written a column about an essay.

12:08.597 --> 12:15.968
They're informal essays as opposed to the formal, in a sense... But is this kind of a traditional essay in your view?

12:15.988 --> 12:16.749
No, I don't care.

12:16.809 --> 12:22.917
I would divide, you know, just the scholarly discussion would be that people would divide essays into the formal and to the informal.

12:23.077 --> 12:27.944
And Bacon, Francis Bacon, would have written, he would consider formal essays.

12:28.365 --> 12:30.828
But I think people like Charles Lamb or H.L.

12:30.868 --> 12:32.170
Mencken, to name two...

12:32.707 --> 12:38.153
Gore Vidal, in a way, I think some of his best work is essays.

12:38.534 --> 12:40.276
So I would say they're informal essays.

12:40.857 --> 12:44.441
And while I was writing them, I felt a responsibility to make them entertaining.

12:44.581 --> 12:46.163
I was talking about ignoring readers.

12:46.183 --> 12:59.659
I don't mean to say I was ignoring readers, but I was writing for a certain kind of reader that would be, and since writing is show business to a degree, to entertain them and get them out of the concept of the dry essay and the repertorial,

13:01.040 --> 13:13.172
And try to put, in a way, write the kind of essay that I would like to read, which has the color of, no pun intended, of the culinary, of the sociological, of the anecdote.

13:13.573 --> 13:18.178
So I tried to make this as anecdotal and highly accessible that way as I could.

13:18.358 --> 13:20.240
So I would say they're informal essays.

13:22.983 --> 13:27.267
And that's why they're cyclic rather than linear.

13:27.517 --> 13:29.921
They're not linear, moving from one point.

13:30.081 --> 13:31.443
They could have begun at the end.

13:32.004 --> 13:33.787
So there's a kind of cyclic quality to them.

13:34.448 --> 13:37.032
I mean, you'll do literature, and you'll come back to literature.

13:37.492 --> 13:37.953
Exactly.

13:38.253 --> 13:40.717
And I could have begun in a thousand places.

13:40.737 --> 13:49.651
That's why the seeming randomness, I'm open to the charge of seeming randomness without being guilty of it.

13:49.851 --> 13:53.777
When you decided that we were going to do the three primary colors, I mean, how does it

13:55.377 --> 13:58.480
Do you start with the fund of knowledge that you have?

13:58.761 --> 14:03.746
The thing is, you don't really start... And then are you alert to everything that you see?

14:03.866 --> 14:09.552
In one very real way, I didn't start... You know, I didn't start in the way that one starts a race.

14:10.393 --> 14:11.534
I actually entered.

14:12.695 --> 14:13.316
Do you know what I mean?

14:13.997 --> 14:22.305
I entered the essay, and I came back because... I mean, even I write... I think most novelists don't write in the sense that they start.

14:22.325 --> 14:24.928
I'm making a pedantic distinction between starting and entering.

14:25.381 --> 14:36.256
Faulkner began ... What's the novel?

14:36.396 --> 14:44.908
No, the one I'm thinking with Benji ... Oh, The Song of the Fury.

14:46.270 --> 14:54.021
Yeah, he began The Song of the Fury by just picturing a girl up in a tree, a young girl up in a tree with a pair of dirty drawers.

14:54.777 --> 15:00.587
So I actually entered this, and I couldn't even tell you where I entered it.

15:00.847 --> 15:06.917
But I started looking at putting together paragraphs and stringing together Christmas lights in a way, you know?

15:07.699 --> 15:11.605
So it began with a certain kind of happy randomness.

15:12.631 --> 15:15.175
And I tried to make it... I love this for my tape.

15:15.255 --> 15:17.418
I have an archive of tapes, you know, presenters.

15:17.438 --> 15:17.579
Yeah.

15:18.140 --> 15:23.328
Everyone has... You know, I used to have giddy hands here.

15:23.348 --> 15:25.751
I was on the second 2020 program.

15:25.932 --> 15:26.512
Is that right?

15:26.532 --> 15:39.853
Yeah, I mean, no big thing, but after John Paul I died, I had been in a seminary and a monastery, you know, and after John Paul I died, I had a friend in New York that I knew something about the church, so...

15:40.137 --> 15:44.882
They came, and I was writing one day, and about five trucks from CBS pulled in the driveway.

15:45.383 --> 15:45.583
Here?

15:45.883 --> 15:47.505
Yeah, it was a horrifying experience.

15:47.545 --> 15:48.366
I wasn't prepared.

15:48.646 --> 15:51.289
But anyway, we're sitting outside, and these guinea hens, you know what they had?

15:51.309 --> 15:53.692
They're kind of gray barters, and they're African birds.

15:54.953 --> 15:58.217
They were squawking and running around, and the sound man was bullshit.

15:58.237 --> 15:59.278
She said, shut it off!

16:00.099 --> 16:02.962
What was the first of the piece at 2020?

16:02.982 --> 16:06.346
It was on Pope John Paul I's death, and the mystery of it.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.929
And we're talking about the state of the Turing.

16:09.449 --> 16:15.396
I didn't know about your background in a system.

16:15.416 --> 16:15.817
Yeah, yeah.

16:15.837 --> 16:20.342
Is there some kind of a biographical thing that I could have at some point?

16:20.362 --> 16:21.143
I don't really.

16:21.183 --> 16:31.796
You know, there is one at Udahlke Archive that they printed, but after high school I went into a Trappist monastery, and then I left there and went into the Franciscan.

16:31.936 --> 16:32.757
In Spencer, yeah.

16:32.977 --> 16:35.220
I was there, yeah.

16:35.386 --> 16:41.757
As I said to someone once, I could have been a man of letters, instead I became, I mean, I could have been a saint, instead I became a man of letters.

16:44.501 --> 16:56.061
So, but I just wanted to say, and as I started working in the essays, you know, I began to feel, I just wanted to put a spine around a lot of that flesh, because there's no end.

16:56.497 --> 17:00.721
I don't think a day passes when I don't find another wonderful fact about red.

17:00.761 --> 17:02.362
I was just reading... That you loved it.

17:02.382 --> 17:03.163
Absolutely, yeah.

17:03.463 --> 17:05.826
And Jörg, that's going to happen to you... Oh, it's happening already?

17:05.846 --> 17:06.246
Oh, sure.

17:06.266 --> 17:10.009
I just finished reading... Well, I'm halfway through Kangaroo.

17:10.350 --> 17:11.231
I have never read it before.

17:11.271 --> 17:11.971
It's pretty bad.

17:11.991 --> 17:12.532
The D.H.

17:12.552 --> 17:14.093
Lawrence novel.

17:14.113 --> 17:21.640
But there's a whole red, odd, very odd bits about red and the color red in the first chapter.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.702
I don't even know why.

17:24.475 --> 17:26.457
Well, you sure got a lot of Proust in here, though.

17:26.817 --> 17:27.858
Yeah, well, I love him.

17:28.599 --> 17:31.082
I'd like to find a manuscript of that book.

17:31.862 --> 17:35.206
You talk about... Yeah.

17:35.226 --> 17:38.409
Yeah, and I think... And I'm so glad you didn't call it Remembrance of Things.

17:38.569 --> 17:40.050
Yeah, yeah, I know.

17:41.232 --> 17:47.398
But I think this book also reflects a lot of my taste in literature and fascination.

17:47.538 --> 17:50.100
So there's a lot of the autobiographical in it.

17:50.141 --> 17:52.643
But Greta once said, all writing is confession.

17:52.960 --> 18:04.716
And even in the most formal books or essays that are non-personal, you do confess to a certain person.

18:04.736 --> 18:06.778
There is a personal portrait that emerges.

18:07.179 --> 18:10.623
I'm not sure what kind of a pedantic little pig emerges from this.

18:12.946 --> 18:17.893
Do you have favorite colors and colors that you detest, colors that move you to motion?

18:18.073 --> 18:21.718
I don't have really strong opinions about that.

18:21.918 --> 18:23.860
I tend to like primary colors.

18:26.503 --> 18:39.698
When I was growing up, there were white cars, there were red cars, there were blue cars, but now there's a certain kind of big thrill with the pastel and cars and a lot of other things that put me off.

18:41.219 --> 18:50.710
So I would say that would be an interesting thing, but sunlight yellow has always been a great buoyant color for me.

18:51.213 --> 18:58.004
I see as kind of the embodiment of heaven and, you know, the center of Christ's forehead kind of thing.

18:58.766 --> 19:10.225
I mean, do you see colors, and do you, I mean, like scents, for instance, you can smell something, and I, it'll, if it's a smell, some smells can bring me back 30 years, instantly to a spot.

19:10.245 --> 19:12.949
Yeah, synesthesia, and absolutely, yeah.

19:12.969 --> 19:16.495
Or a sound, or a record, you know, I hear certain songs, certain

19:16.880 --> 19:18.802
I mean, you mentioned jazz.

19:18.882 --> 19:26.251
I love jazz, you know, and I can hear Miles Davis kind of blue, you know, and I zap back to high school when I bought this album.

19:26.271 --> 19:26.932
Well, that's good.

19:26.992 --> 19:29.455
That's a reflex.

19:29.475 --> 19:30.136
I can tell you this.

19:30.196 --> 19:31.257
Colors aren't lost to me.

19:31.298 --> 19:32.599
I remember... How do the colors do that?

19:32.619 --> 19:34.301
I don't think they do, actually.

19:34.361 --> 19:35.543
No, well, they don't.

19:35.583 --> 19:39.968
They wouldn't be as graphic, I think, as sound, but...

19:40.555 --> 19:42.880
I can tell you that colors aren't lost on me.

19:43.301 --> 19:48.233
I remember the color of the brown sweater of the first girl I kissed.

19:48.253 --> 19:50.037
I mean, a vivid brown.

19:50.218 --> 19:55.169
And so I can remember colors.

19:55.550 --> 19:56.893
It's hard to remember smells.

19:56.973 --> 19:58.918
They say it's impossible to remember smells.

19:59.337 --> 20:10.108
I can't remember them, but I think maybe that's why when you smell them, and then you flash back, and that could be part of the same thing.

20:10.128 --> 20:20.599
Well, smell and taste, but see, the smell evokes it, but you can't, if I said to you, you know, you went at a funeral parlor in, say, 1959, and do you remember the smell of all those lilies?

20:20.980 --> 20:28.888
You have an intellectual understanding of that, but it's not the same as the way that Proust dipped that, Madeleine, and, you know, that...

20:29.189 --> 20:38.501
But I remember the smell of the Longo Pole in the Philippines, and I sure remember the smell of, you know... I think you remember the smell, and remember in quotation marks.

20:38.521 --> 20:39.242
Probably.

20:39.262 --> 20:42.306
But that's not original, and I'm not saying that you're wrong.

20:42.386 --> 20:46.010
It's just suggested that that's an intellectual thing.

20:46.951 --> 20:56.884
But I respond to colors vividly, and never think of the 70s without seeing that kind of mustard yellow soup.

20:57.674 --> 20:59.802
that evokes Engelberg, Humperdinck.

20:59.822 --> 21:07.431
And I think I do castigate a lot of the dim... The 70s were icy as a really bad mustard yellow...

21:07.833 --> 21:19.312
Do you remember when everybody wore shirts, pastel colored shirts with these wild, I see these old photographs of myself of the long size and I'm like, I really wear it.

21:19.332 --> 21:20.955
You're talking about fashion or color.

21:20.975 --> 21:23.319
Well, fashion, which involves color.

21:23.719 --> 21:25.983
There was a great lust for the pastel in the 70s.

21:26.143 --> 21:26.504
That's right.

21:26.784 --> 21:33.756
But what I'm trying to say, back in the 50s, cars and refrigerators and many other things were specific.

21:33.989 --> 21:36.894
There were statements made, yeah.

21:37.495 --> 21:44.125
I think there's this idea that pastels somehow, people with great sensibility have pastels.

21:44.145 --> 21:54.863
You know, that avocado green refrigerator somehow bespoke a little more insight into the spiritual provision of its value than if you had just a damn white refrigerator.

21:55.343 --> 22:01.313
I thought, and maybe I didn't see it, but you, of course green is not one of your colors here, but

22:01.732 --> 22:04.335
the genesis of the phrase, green with envy.

22:05.056 --> 22:05.296
Yeah.

22:05.316 --> 22:06.437
Do you know what that is?

22:06.457 --> 22:08.760
Well, yeah, but I talk about yellow.

22:09.260 --> 22:15.427
Shakespeare and Burton and Dunn actually talk about yellow as a color of envy, too.

22:15.747 --> 22:18.370
But wasn't it Robert Greene who wrote The Groseworth of Witch?

22:18.390 --> 22:18.590
Yeah.

22:18.610 --> 22:20.753
He was furious about Shakespeare.

22:20.773 --> 22:21.874
He was so jealous.

22:21.894 --> 22:22.134
Yeah.

22:22.154 --> 22:24.196
And so I think that's where Greene was.

22:24.216 --> 22:24.977
Oh, it could be.

22:25.117 --> 22:25.798
It could be.

22:25.998 --> 22:27.621
I don't think it had anything to do with the color.

22:27.641 --> 22:29.444
I think it had everything to do with the color.

22:29.464 --> 22:30.085
That's interesting.

22:30.125 --> 22:31.246
I've never heard that before.

22:31.547 --> 22:32.769
Yeah.

22:32.829 --> 22:35.553
Remember the famous, the Shakespeare scene?

22:35.573 --> 22:37.096
Yeah.

22:37.256 --> 22:38.358
Decked out.

22:38.378 --> 22:41.102
Decked out as things you can... Remember, it was just... Yeah.

22:41.603 --> 22:42.845
Wearing someone else's feathers.

22:42.865 --> 22:43.566
That's right, yeah.

22:43.586 --> 22:44.828
I forget exactly how it goes.

22:44.848 --> 22:52.821
But I'm reading a book right now, believe me, that's convincing that Shakespeare was the absolute... That he didn't write them at all.

22:53.202 --> 22:53.322
Oh.

22:53.858 --> 22:54.639
Which book is this?

22:55.640 --> 22:56.241
Not the Ogden book.

22:56.261 --> 22:56.401
Yeah.

22:56.421 --> 22:57.823
I know the Ogden book.

22:58.224 --> 23:00.767
It's a damn convincing argument.

23:01.749 --> 23:01.849
Yeah.

23:01.869 --> 23:03.051
Well, who did?

23:03.091 --> 23:03.872
Who was Shakespeare?

23:04.072 --> 23:07.236
He says it was the Earl of Oxford, De Vere.

23:07.256 --> 23:07.837
Give me a break.

23:08.738 --> 23:14.086
And then, do we ever read the... I'm telling you, that's what I said when this book was given to me, and I'm halfway through the book.

23:14.426 --> 23:15.628
It's astonishing.

23:15.648 --> 23:20.394
Did he fool Sam... It was a man that... Did he fool Ben Johnson and... Yeah, yeah.

23:20.414 --> 23:21.195
No, no, no, no.

23:21.275 --> 23:22.777
It wasn't a question of fooling.

23:22.797 --> 23:23.258
It was that

23:23.508 --> 23:28.895
It was that this fellow, William Shakespeare, did write some things, and he was given this.

23:30.117 --> 23:33.381
There's a whole horse get loose from the barn.

23:34.142 --> 23:39.829
It's an astonishing article, because there was a guy named William Shakespeare that was a real miner.

23:40.770 --> 23:42.653
You know, this goes right to the heart of it.

23:42.673 --> 23:48.100
I mean, I had once a Jehovah's Witness here explain to me that Christ was in the Son of God.

23:48.140 --> 23:52.165
And I wanted to, as I was listening, I was crying inside.

23:53.022 --> 23:55.945
It was such a ruinous thing to hear.

23:56.285 --> 23:58.307
Well, you didn't have to agree with him, did you?

23:58.327 --> 23:58.947
No, I didn't.

23:58.967 --> 24:09.136
I didn't agree with him, but it's knowledge, I mean, and I was hearing him paint this, you know, portrait of, you know, in his mind, what Christ wasn't.

24:09.636 --> 24:14.621
So I wasn't agreeing with him, but I was listening to, you know, and there was a certain cogency to what he was presenting.

24:14.641 --> 24:15.501
I mean, what do we know?

24:16.482 --> 24:19.845
But it shook some timbers of mine.

24:19.865 --> 24:22.067
Now, are you,

24:22.655 --> 24:25.659
No, I haven't been teaching for a couple of years.

24:28.422 --> 24:31.406
What did you teach?

24:33.128 --> 24:37.974
At Yale, I invented a course called Autobiography that was very popular.

24:38.355 --> 24:41.899
We read about 15 autobiographies, and each student wrote a 50-page one.

24:42.620 --> 24:43.941
And they were very popular.

24:43.961 --> 24:46.485
There used to be a line waiting to get in that class.

24:46.505 --> 24:46.985
What level?

24:47.866 --> 24:50.029
They were mostly juniors and seniors.

24:50.262 --> 24:56.470
And so we had workshops during the course of the semester.

24:57.051 --> 25:00.335
And then they read the crowning last couple of weeks.

25:00.355 --> 25:03.819
We would take time and everybody would read sections of it.

25:04.360 --> 25:10.527
I had tears and people reading about their father, about their mother, about their daughter.

25:10.547 --> 25:11.569
Oh, it was wonderful.

25:11.629 --> 25:13.331
And I had some brilliant things.

25:13.351 --> 25:18.177
But I taught seminars in Melville, Moby Dick.

25:18.578 --> 25:21.121
Oh, literature, literature.

25:21.461 --> 25:25.847
I thought that you had been involved in the sciences.

25:25.867 --> 25:28.149
Maybe it's the MIT connection.

25:28.189 --> 25:29.371
No, but I did teach it.

25:29.751 --> 25:33.736
But occasionally we'd have to teach creative writing, which I hated to teach.

25:33.776 --> 25:39.723
So you're a full-time writer at this point?

25:39.763 --> 25:44.248
Yeah, writing for magazines and trying to finish my novel.

25:45.005 --> 25:47.347
No, your last novel was with Alan.

25:47.367 --> 25:49.429
That was an adultery, I guess.

25:49.449 --> 25:50.630
That was, what, 80?

25:50.650 --> 25:50.930
87.

25:50.950 --> 25:52.092
87.

25:52.132 --> 25:55.995
So, do you get blocked at all?

25:56.195 --> 25:57.096
No, no, not at all.

25:57.116 --> 25:58.437
I've written, no, I have three books.

25:58.457 --> 25:59.478
I want to show you three books.

26:00.119 --> 26:00.920
I'll show you what I'm working.

26:00.940 --> 26:05.084
I have three books ready to, I have three loaves of bread in there ready to cook.

26:05.104 --> 26:14.252
It's a question where the whole bosom, a book of fables, a book of, second book of poetry, and a book of essays called Artists Who Kill, and other essays, Artists Who Kill Somebody.

26:14.857 --> 26:16.279
And then there were 18 essays.

26:16.299 --> 26:17.541
Is it true?

26:17.581 --> 26:18.703
Yeah, yeah.

26:18.783 --> 26:19.924
No, it actually killed someone.

26:20.004 --> 26:23.650
But writers... For instance, they'd be a couple.

26:23.670 --> 26:24.211
Of writers?

26:24.371 --> 26:24.531
Yeah.

26:24.992 --> 26:33.985
Mark Twain shot a man off his horse and wrote a story about it called The Story of a Campaign That Failed.

26:34.005 --> 26:44.560
And that was the reason, you know, he was so over... He and a couple of rednecks... That sounds like a great... And that's why he went out west during the Civil War, never fought in the Civil War.

26:45.839 --> 26:52.247
But then Caravaggio killed a man, a lot of painters and singers and musicians.

26:53.108 --> 27:06.245
So there's a book of poems, there's a book of fables, ten fables, prose, a book of eighteen essays, and a book of fifty-two essays that Alan, you know, we were talking about this on the phone.

27:06.725 --> 27:10.910
So these people cringe when they see me, and I'm three-quarters of the way through that book.

27:10.930 --> 27:12.252
So I'm not blocked,

27:13.008 --> 27:24.226
I'll tell you something, I don't get asked to do a lot of, you know, if I had written some tits and bums book, I'd be financially, I'd be artistically humiliated.

27:24.246 --> 27:26.109
Do you have it in you to write such a book?

27:26.129 --> 27:30.836
No, I don't, but I'm reviewing the Ann Rice, the new Ann Rice book.

27:30.856 --> 27:33.000
Tell everybody, who are you reviewing that book?

27:33.020 --> 27:38.188
Chicago Tribune, it's Death on a Bun, it is so tiresome, 600,000.

27:40.818 --> 27:42.582
Who contacted you?

27:42.602 --> 27:45.669
Is that John Blades?

27:45.689 --> 27:50.039
The Chicago Tribune?

27:50.059 --> 27:52.144
I'm just curious.

27:52.164 --> 27:53.807
I'll deal with a guy named Larry Carr.

27:53.988 --> 27:55.050
Oh, that's the other paper.

27:55.070 --> 27:55.671
Okay, fine.

27:55.872 --> 27:58.197
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

27:58.217 --> 28:00.362
I don't want to lose a track here.

28:01.777 --> 28:03.820
Tell me about writing the essay.

28:04.101 --> 28:08.107
What kind of satisfaction do you get from writing essays?

28:09.769 --> 28:19.244
The satisfaction is no different than making a pizza.

28:20.406 --> 28:28.999
And fixing a nice... I was going to say a Red Sox game, but no, I have to draw the line.

28:29.418 --> 28:35.525
But, no, I would say the satisfaction is really, it's just the joy of doing a nice page, a nice paragraph.

28:35.565 --> 28:36.426
Don't you feel that?

28:36.486 --> 28:37.548
It's a wonderful feeling.

28:37.988 --> 28:46.939
And, you know, it's a way of taking, to use a rather arch phrase, the cookie cutter of art and putting it into the dough of life.

28:47.059 --> 28:51.805
The dough of life is rather large and unwieldy and dribbling around.

28:52.546 --> 28:57.872
And so you have this bibliographical fact over there and this book collector over there and this nitwit in prison and this.

28:58.173 --> 29:07.287
But what you do, and what I did in these essays is really a way of taking, gathering that dough together, framing it.

29:07.327 --> 29:13.516
You know, there's a real aspect of ordering things that's behind collecting in a way.

29:14.758 --> 29:18.003
Getting the many to be one, one collection.

29:19.004 --> 29:25.193
And that's really, you know, metaphysics is the study of, you know, the many and the one, and the one and the many, the idea of becoming and being.

29:25.754 --> 29:27.657
But what I really tried to do with this book is actually

29:28.379 --> 29:39.553
gather the many into the one, under the rubric of red, all the wonderful and, you know, heterogeneous facts to make under one roof.

29:39.573 --> 29:40.795
That alone is a delight.

29:40.815 --> 29:47.963
You know, I wrote a novel in 82 called Darkinville's Cat, in which... Anthony Bridges picks it as one of the... Yeah, he did.

29:48.224 --> 29:51.868
And there's a chapter in there called The Misogynist Library.

29:52.249 --> 29:54.792
And what I did was compile

29:55.177 --> 29:57.319
A bibliography, as it were.

29:57.479 --> 30:00.001
But it's actually a chapter.

30:00.342 --> 30:02.444
He's going into his library where there's a scene.

30:02.884 --> 30:07.468
So let's say in chapter F, there's a scene.

30:07.488 --> 30:09.510
Then G, they go into the library.

30:10.691 --> 30:12.012
And H, there's another scene.

30:12.473 --> 30:18.558
But G, I actually call it, I think it is called a misogynist library.

30:18.578 --> 30:19.659
And there's a compilation.

30:19.920 --> 30:23.783
And one guy in the review said the book was, I think it was a $21.95 book.

30:24.100 --> 30:28.384
He said it was worth the book, the price of the book, just to have that bibliography.

30:28.404 --> 30:29.685
I was teaching at Harvard at the time.

30:30.066 --> 30:31.227
I called up professors.

30:31.247 --> 30:34.310
I would call up, it was a Russian professor, Sechkerev.

30:34.590 --> 30:35.891
I'd call him and say, hello.

30:36.291 --> 30:37.633
I'd say, this is Alexander Theroux.

30:37.653 --> 30:38.113
I'm calling.

30:38.313 --> 30:40.115
And listen, I have a very odd request.

30:40.175 --> 30:40.475
Go ahead.

30:40.996 --> 30:46.241
Listen, I'm writing a novel in which I'm interested in Russian misogyny.

30:46.261 --> 30:50.665
Oh, well, let me tell you, there are interesting things, you know, that kind of scholarly of the...

30:51.185 --> 30:53.609
That's a wonderful quality I miss in the academics.

30:54.109 --> 30:55.852
Academics I've come to dislike.

30:56.333 --> 30:57.434
Why is that?

30:58.115 --> 31:03.383
They're florists and pedantic dicks, I think.

31:03.403 --> 31:06.908
Give me a quote I can use.

31:06.928 --> 31:09.372
Do you have my book of poems, the book of Gollipop Trollers?

31:09.432 --> 31:09.632
No?

31:10.333 --> 31:12.036
Because I have a real attack on them.

31:12.056 --> 31:13.378
I would say that they're...
