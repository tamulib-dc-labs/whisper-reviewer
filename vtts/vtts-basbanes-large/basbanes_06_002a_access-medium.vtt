WEBVTT

00:02.191 --> 00:04.374
We're talking with John Dan at the Clements Library.

00:04.494 --> 00:06.176
Okay, why don't you just start again with what you were saying?

00:06.316 --> 00:06.677
Sure.

00:07.217 --> 00:11.883
Well, this is an exhibit that I put in this spring.

00:12.944 --> 00:14.827
We have an associates group.

00:15.788 --> 00:24.979
And this spring I gave a talk on trying to explain what the library is for, why it's here.

00:25.160 --> 00:27.102
And it was titled...

00:27.723 --> 00:43.104
the whys and wherefores of the Clements Library revisited because Randolph Adams, the first director, had given such an, well, it started as an interview in the 20s, and I wanted to go back and sort of talk about it.

00:43.124 --> 00:55.941
But in conjunction with this, I put together this exhibit to attempt to explain to the layman why we collect, how we collect,

00:56.377 --> 01:07.077
A sense of, a little bit of a sense of what things cost, the fact that some of them are very expensive, some things are not very expensive.

01:07.097 --> 01:09.662
And so I just took a representative grade.

01:09.702 --> 01:11.445
I took the calendar year 1989.

01:11.465 --> 01:17.416
And every item in this case was acquired in that year.

01:17.476 --> 01:17.997
Right.

01:18.348 --> 01:20.690
And it's purely representative.

01:20.730 --> 01:31.120
I could have done the same exhibit on any year, but it was the last year in which the items have all come back from the bindery, and so I could put my finger on the items.

01:31.901 --> 01:45.874
But I would really urge that before, maybe right now, why don't you, if you could just walk, it goes this way, that way, and if you see anything here, you could, of course, read it into your...

01:46.040 --> 01:49.383
And then once you've done that, Sedan, what is your time?

01:50.044 --> 01:50.805
Toby's with me.

01:50.845 --> 01:51.625
He's coming back at 3.

01:52.106 --> 01:54.108
But I've got a little more time if I need.

01:54.148 --> 01:54.428
All right.

01:54.488 --> 01:56.230
Well, this will take you about 20 minutes.

01:56.250 --> 01:56.490
Okay.

01:56.710 --> 02:02.416
If you would do that, I think you would find your questions to me.

02:02.696 --> 02:03.276
Say that again.

02:03.296 --> 02:05.979
I love it.

02:05.999 --> 02:11.845
I'd say, you know, Mike Zimmerman is an absolutely brilliant collector.

02:11.865 --> 02:12.385
I think of

02:13.090 --> 02:25.986
In Americana, the most exciting collector that I have personal

02:26.573 --> 02:49.948
delightful and you know it's daring it takes uh new thoughts new ideas we make a really great point and he has that he goes on a few lines he doesn't miss it when i was doing a lot of people

02:49.928 --> 02:51.250
that he lied.

02:51.630 --> 02:55.314
And he only went several books.

02:55.374 --> 02:59.038
Let's talk a little bit about that.

02:59.179 --> 03:13.635
I'm not going to be very few things are unique in this, you know, but it certainly is quite a strong institution with character and sort of its own identity.

03:14.276 --> 03:15.838
No question about it.

03:15.858 --> 03:19.682
And it is one of the facts that I've worked with

03:20.219 --> 03:37.397
is the debt that scholarship owes to the private collection, which has tried and dramatized with a number of stories, both contemporary, such as Michael Simmons, and Bill Shady, and Tyler Gordon, and Colby, in a different way.

03:37.497 --> 03:48.268
But also, the debt that we owe to people like Henry Huntington, and William Andrews Clark, and Colger, and in fact, I think every major

03:48.637 --> 03:51.421
institution at some level within a public library.

03:51.822 --> 03:52.883
Oh, that's true.

03:52.903 --> 03:53.304
It's a collective.

03:53.684 --> 03:54.966
Yeah.

03:54.986 --> 04:10.128
Now, you know, it's one of those facets of American life that, well, that's American life throughout the world.

04:10.148 --> 04:10.408
It does

04:11.080 --> 04:14.788
People are always .

04:17.573 --> 04:24.227
People should give all their money to take care of immediate pressing social problems.

04:25.229 --> 04:28.937
But the sort of institutions that you're just describing,

04:29.474 --> 04:34.720
He's so much for the souls of the minds of people.

04:35.641 --> 04:48.316
At 22nd, they were so many people who taught this vision of history or beauty or whatever else brings people to the book.

04:48.336 --> 04:58.468
And I think what's great about people like Clemens and Dr. Brown and Huntington

04:59.073 --> 05:18.850
is that they institutionalize not simply their collection, but this collecting and enthusiasm, and those institutions which have really thrived are the ones that are still pursuing the collection that their founders enjoyed so much.

05:18.870 --> 05:24.315
That's very important, because Tyler Adams, of course, and J.C.

05:24.395 --> 05:27.578
Brown's model of what institutions such as this were.

05:28.030 --> 05:30.174
I guess the...oh, great.

05:30.194 --> 05:32.439
Thank you very much.

05:32.839 --> 05:34.843
Yeah, great.

05:34.863 --> 05:42.799
This occupies space in the University of Michigan, but this is, I guess, a private institution, is that correct?

05:42.919 --> 05:49.532
No, we're very similar to John Carter-Brown.

05:50.508 --> 05:57.398
Clements was an Ann Arbor native graduate of the university.

05:57.478 --> 05:59.921
He captured him very well.

05:59.941 --> 06:02.044
Looks a little bit like Morgan.

06:02.104 --> 06:04.588
He does.

06:05.309 --> 06:14.642
He made his money in a very unromantic business of building heavy construction machinery, cranes.

06:14.802 --> 06:15.904
He was an engineer.

06:17.446 --> 06:20.430
And had a very good intel from

06:21.085 --> 06:24.671
the 90s until the Depression.

06:24.691 --> 06:26.555
He died in 1934.

06:28.238 --> 06:34.889
He had taken history courses, so he was always interested in it.

06:34.909 --> 06:46.249
But at about the turn of the century, he became fascinated by a small collection made by a local

06:47.866 --> 06:52.412
Amateur historian antiquarian in Bay City, Michigan, where he lived.

06:53.233 --> 07:03.326
And this was a man who had attended some of the great book auctions of the 1870s and 80s in New York.

07:03.346 --> 07:13.779
And he put together a select library of primary birth materials, which no one else in Bay City is particularly appreciated.

07:13.800 --> 07:16.523
He loved this book, fell in love with the collection,

07:17.009 --> 07:23.257
He bought that collection and then decided to collect.

07:23.277 --> 07:29.846
And he was one of these people that when he got into something, he did it in a very systematic way.

07:31.488 --> 07:35.734
If he was going to collect, he wanted to collect in a first grade way.

07:36.695 --> 07:44.265
And he cultivated three men in particular who were his primary advisers in his collecting.

07:45.022 --> 07:47.004
That was Henry Stevens in London.

07:48.125 --> 07:53.991
It was later Harper, then a young dealer in New York.

07:55.312 --> 08:05.303
And it was George P. Linship, librarian at the John Carter Brown, who later became librarian at Harper.

08:05.443 --> 08:14.472
And Harper and Stevens were his friends.

08:14.890 --> 08:19.738
major sources throughout his collection, although he does with many other dealers.

08:19.878 --> 08:22.222
Can you give it to the doctor?

08:22.242 --> 08:24.305
Oh, yes, to some extent.

08:24.485 --> 08:35.743
And Randolph Adams, the first director of the library, his picture you see there, Tom's father, was a very close friend of the doctor.

08:36.684 --> 08:39.649
We never, we couldn't afford the doctor's prices.

08:40.928 --> 08:58.858
But the doctors fairly had a high regard for Adams, and Adams had a high regard for the doctor, and they both enjoyed sitting with a bottle on the table and talking books and book people.

08:59.339 --> 09:02.384
Couldn't Mr. Clemming explain the doctor?

09:03.205 --> 09:07.392
Well, he occasionally.

09:07.642 --> 09:16.530
In a way, Clements was almost getting the books at the source before the doctor got it.

09:21.715 --> 09:27.600
Well, I would say that he used Beeler to meet me.

09:27.620 --> 09:36.788
Harper, the three men I mentioned knew as much about the fine points of physiography.

09:37.628 --> 09:42.774
They knew what was the important book, what was the secondary important book.

09:42.794 --> 09:43.956
They knew values.

09:44.957 --> 09:59.875
And so I think the key to Cummins collecting was simply rounding up as personal friends, advisors, and sources the people who knew as much as anyone on the page of the earth about the field he was collecting.

09:59.895 --> 10:04.901
So it was, Cummins was a very intelligent guy.

10:04.941 --> 10:07.264
He was,

10:08.864 --> 10:27.463
He read the books, he was interested in them, but he brought an expertise through these three people to what he was doing, which he couldn't have developed on his own unless he had started out.

10:27.484 --> 10:33.690
Did he develop his own expertise and did Clemens become an authority in time?

10:34.447 --> 10:38.210
Are you thinking what he delegated to?

10:38.370 --> 10:41.493
Well, he became very knowledgeable.

10:41.513 --> 10:46.478
He had a sense of bibliography.

10:46.558 --> 10:48.219
He read bibliography.

10:48.239 --> 10:49.820
He studied his books.

10:49.841 --> 10:57.747
But he was neither a consummate scholar nor a professional bibliographer.

10:58.008 --> 11:02.952
So it was as a collector that he

11:03.117 --> 11:12.406
You see, then, once he established this library, Randolph Adams, as the director, was his authority.

11:12.426 --> 11:20.794
And Adams was a very precocious, very brilliant historian and collector.

11:21.074 --> 11:27.460
I'm using his book, Pre-American, as a source for it.

11:27.480 --> 11:27.600
Yes.

11:27.980 --> 11:28.561
Yeah.

11:29.522 --> 11:32.905
Well, he was so... So Cummins was blessed with...

11:33.205 --> 11:40.556
That thing takes a certain personality to get people like this to take the time to do what they did.

11:41.277 --> 11:44.401
I think he was also blessed in a couple of ways.

11:44.421 --> 11:48.547
He was collecting in a very competitive period.

11:49.689 --> 11:57.120
You know, as you are well aware when you read the Rosenbach biography and you go back and pick it.

11:57.607 --> 12:01.772
Auctions made the front page of the New York Times in that period.

12:01.792 --> 12:05.257
That was my reading that time story.

12:05.317 --> 12:05.698
Yeah.

12:05.898 --> 12:09.302
Page one, not only there, but all over America.

12:09.463 --> 12:10.344
Absolutely.

12:10.564 --> 12:11.826
Yep.

12:12.547 --> 12:18.394
Well, Clements did not have multi-news behind him.

12:19.696 --> 12:25.023
He had, his resources were very modest in comparison to J.C.

12:25.043 --> 12:26.685
Morgan or Huntington.

12:27.104 --> 12:28.946
Did he see them in this competition, though?

12:28.966 --> 12:35.172
Was he trying to build a library, an institution that could stand in there?

12:35.192 --> 12:36.533
Oh, yes, no question about it.

12:36.853 --> 12:37.654
And he did.

12:37.694 --> 12:39.155
This was all from the beginning, right?

12:39.175 --> 12:45.181
He wasn't really collecting for William Clemens to enjoy a library in his home or things.

12:46.142 --> 12:50.226
We could probably say that the goal from the outset was this institution.

12:50.246 --> 12:56.031
Well, he first enunciated the idea of establishing this place maybe

12:57.496 --> 13:01.802
Eight or ten years after he started to talk.

13:01.822 --> 13:04.946
He started in 1904.

13:05.047 --> 13:09.553
I will give you a biography of Mr. Trump, which I have, which is quite dense.

13:11.035 --> 13:14.079
And so it will pin down some of those facts.

13:14.099 --> 13:17.564
And I'll give you several things to be very useful.

13:17.644 --> 13:22.351
But 1904 was a year that he just got into it.

13:22.451 --> 13:23.993
Did he become obsessed with it?

13:24.479 --> 13:28.023
It became his great passion.

13:28.343 --> 13:30.666
His greatest passion.

13:30.686 --> 13:39.135
And by about 1915 or so, I believe, you start to get hints that he's thinking of a larger way.

13:39.416 --> 13:48.366
One of his sons died in World War I. I think this put an end to the idea of passing the collection on within the family.

13:48.506 --> 13:50.328
So he may have been friends, I think.

13:50.348 --> 13:52.050
There might have been.

13:52.330 --> 13:54.132
First, he had a beautiful home.

13:54.483 --> 13:56.726
Loved to have the library.

13:57.046 --> 14:04.956
He created sort of a country house atmosphere in his home, although it was actually in a town.

14:06.678 --> 14:13.947
But there's a limit to how much you can impress people with books that don't know how many of those people.

14:13.967 --> 14:20.035
Yeah, so he became, in Michigan, he became a regent of the University of Michigan.

14:21.061 --> 14:25.767
At about the same time, he began collecting.

14:25.787 --> 14:36.881
At that time, before the vast bureaucracy, if it's twice, the regents broke up into committees to take care of church things on capital.

14:37.001 --> 14:39.965
Clements was involved in the buildings.

14:39.985 --> 14:44.290
Among the buildings he dealt with were the lives of the library.

14:44.310 --> 14:48.756
So he's given thought to libraries, and

14:49.090 --> 14:59.063
I think with the death of his son, it was absolutely certain that the university was replaced.

14:59.624 --> 15:07.394
Now, he had another son, but he was presumably not interested.

15:07.414 --> 15:10.238
He also was divorced.

15:11.804 --> 15:22.202
in the last few years of his life, which created a certain amount of experience with his family.

15:25.487 --> 15:34.943
When he started to think about putting the collection here, this is when Winship, who had been both the librarian of John Carter Brown, and then

15:35.665 --> 15:42.734
So he sat on both sides of the fence with a collection in the Mayan Library.

15:42.754 --> 15:53.327
And he was, Winship is largely responsible for the form in which the Clements Library plugs into the university.

15:53.347 --> 15:58.314
He said, don't give your collection to the main university library.

15:58.334 --> 16:00.577
No matter what you think, he said.

16:00.597 --> 16:03.360
He said, the books will get put on the shelf.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.178
They'll get marked up.

16:05.279 --> 16:06.661
They'll get stolen.

16:07.543 --> 16:17.721
He said that any way possible, they will, if you leave an endowment, they'll figure out ways to use it for more important practical reasons.

16:17.741 --> 16:23.251
So he was the man that told Cummins to establish a separate institution.

16:24.093 --> 16:28.200
Being a regent, he had the connections, and what's beautiful is that the Congress

16:29.108 --> 16:40.240
The gift agreement setting this up was written, and it's an actual legal contract in which Clements built the building at his expense on the university land.

16:41.362 --> 16:52.754
He gave his collection and returned the university agreed to make it a separate department that plugs into the university at the president's office.

16:52.774 --> 16:57.259
It is governed by a group of five people, the president,

16:58.201 --> 17:23.023
the librarian, main of the university, a colonial historian, and then two outsiders, which it was on the committee for 10 or 15 years, perhaps collectors, perhaps benefactors, but outsiders who are not part of the university.

17:23.043 --> 17:28.107
And what it has done is, by sort of checks and balances,

17:29.015 --> 17:41.830
It ensures that the president doesn't just use the library as a sort of signature position to call somebody that he wants to get out of the way.

17:41.930 --> 17:53.284
It ensures that the main university library doesn't swallow it up and reduce it to insignificance.

17:53.905 --> 18:03.559
An academic scholar will not say, why spend $10,000 for a book when you can get a photocopy for a few dollars and 50 cents?

18:04.720 --> 18:17.479
And it ensures that the collectors do not have you spending a fortune for beautiful things that don't have an academic research realm.

18:18.340 --> 18:19.862
There have only been...

18:20.163 --> 18:23.126
There have only been three directors of the line.

18:23.186 --> 18:24.887
That's something I want to get to.

18:24.907 --> 18:30.112
Tom Adams said that's one of the great continuing strengths.

18:30.252 --> 18:31.793
Total continuity.

18:32.274 --> 18:40.041
Mr. Adams, who I just, I feel as if I know him because of the law of continuity.

18:40.321 --> 18:42.323
And by extension, you know Clemens, really.

18:42.643 --> 18:43.404
I really do.

18:43.584 --> 18:45.606
I know people that know Clemens.

18:46.226 --> 18:48.128
I have known, I've worked with

18:48.597 --> 19:09.981
I worked with a lady in town who was a daunting companion and who attended book sales with Mr. Clements before World War I. I knew briefly that Mrs. Clements, I met her, I have met members of the family.

19:10.433 --> 19:13.598
I know people who knew him well in Bay City.

19:14.539 --> 19:20.968
I knew, when I got here in 1971, there were still academics around who were grown from us.

19:20.988 --> 19:26.396
Adams, I have known many people that, you know, he knew well and worked with.

19:27.919 --> 19:30.462
Of course, I know Tom.

19:30.723 --> 19:32.726
Adams, well, think the world of it.

19:35.830 --> 19:37.873
You're a defender in many ways.

19:37.993 --> 19:39.816
You have something that you have to do.

19:39.897 --> 19:42.761
Oh, that's a question.

19:42.781 --> 19:51.554
I consider that this library has a life of its own, and I would do anything to preserve what this library is for.

19:51.654 --> 19:55.560
Tell me about the life of its own.

19:56.321 --> 19:57.603
What do you mean by that?

19:58.785 --> 20:09.060
Well, the Clemens Library has a very decided role to play at the university.

20:09.749 --> 20:21.200
and in a larger role in the preservation, the collecting and the preservation and making available of research materials in this particular field.

20:21.260 --> 20:23.462
And it's absolutely unique what we do.

20:24.142 --> 20:26.865
We have similarities to the John Carter Brown.

20:27.645 --> 20:33.971
We have similarities to the AIS where there are similarities with the Folger and the Huntington.

20:33.991 --> 20:38.035
But as you know, the more you get into these libraries, everyone is very unique.

20:39.365 --> 20:52.097
And Clements and Adams, and the Adams was director from the very beginning, 1923, until he died in 51.

20:53.078 --> 20:56.181
He was succeeded by Howard Peckham.

20:56.201 --> 20:59.464
Howard had started here in 1934.

21:00.305 --> 21:04.529
He was the manuscript curator from Harry's Vine in 45.

21:05.490 --> 21:08.072
He left to be head of the historical

21:08.474 --> 21:16.164
Bureau of Indiana, but came back in 53 and was director until 77.

21:16.644 --> 21:24.834
I came here in 1971 and was Howard Peckham's director for six years.

21:24.854 --> 21:27.878
We ate lunch together almost every day.

21:28.639 --> 21:32.223
He knew Adams the way I knew him.

21:33.024 --> 21:36.709
So it's always been as if I knew these people.

21:37.060 --> 21:38.642
I have read the letters.

21:38.702 --> 21:45.473
So I really, I feel that I'm doing exactly what Mr. Clemens intended this place to do.

21:46.114 --> 21:49.078
Now, yeah, there's been changes in the way scholars work.

21:49.879 --> 22:04.401
We have, time has gone on that some of the kind of things that we collect are somewhat different from what was being collected from the place open for two reasons.

22:05.107 --> 22:07.871
Scholars and students are interested in other things.

22:08.793 --> 22:17.406
Secondly, in the first 20, 30 years of the library, you have to begin in the sort of basics.

22:17.486 --> 22:28.684
Well, now I think we're in the, from all point of view, in the perfect position to be in if you are

22:29.086 --> 22:31.409
Maniac Collector Design.

22:31.429 --> 22:33.792
And that is... Your Maniac Collector?

22:34.372 --> 22:37.897
Without any question, as we're both at it.

22:37.917 --> 22:42.062
In fact, I mean, really, to the point of this thing.

22:42.202 --> 22:44.425
On an institutional basis.

22:44.445 --> 22:45.546
Oh, yeah.

22:45.867 --> 22:46.948
On an institutional basis.

22:47.008 --> 22:50.252
Well, my book is about Maniacs.

22:50.272 --> 22:53.476
Tell me about institutional things.

22:53.496 --> 22:55.178
Are you saying that, or how do you...

22:56.120 --> 23:19.451
I mean, well, I mean that in the sense of bibliomania, in that I think that my interest in collecting, and I think true collecting, is there's no difference between bibliomania and addiction to substances of various sorts.

23:19.471 --> 23:21.314
I mean, I think it's the same way.

23:21.955 --> 23:23.697
I need a book fix.

23:24.976 --> 23:26.418
with regularity.

23:26.438 --> 23:32.405
I have to keep continually collecting, or I would go through some terrible withdrawal sentence.

23:33.006 --> 23:35.669
Now once in a while I go fishing for a couple of weeks.

23:36.850 --> 23:38.712
But I don't stop thinking about it.

23:39.253 --> 23:53.650
The collecting, collecting is a, I think it's a very civilized activity, and I do it at this library from the highest of motives of promoting scholarship.

23:53.933 --> 23:59.939
But the disease itself is, I don't know whether it's an honorable... You like my title?

24:00.079 --> 24:02.921
No, we don't have any questions.

24:03.121 --> 24:03.842
It's true.

24:04.963 --> 24:12.510
And, you know, all the book collectors I have met, I don't know, where do you get those collections from?

24:13.031 --> 24:13.631
I don't know.

24:13.851 --> 24:15.493
I don't know when you're born with it.

24:15.533 --> 24:16.253
It's genetic.

24:16.834 --> 24:23.400
Now, I personally came from a book collecting background, to some extent.

24:23.954 --> 24:33.185
I, uh, my parents loved history, and they were smart, you know, they were out of all kinds of historic sites, but I always loved history.

24:33.206 --> 24:38.412
But I always had this collective thing, which they never really quite understood.

24:38.432 --> 24:49.005
And I think I must have picked it up from a grandfather of mine, who was an extremely ardent book collector.

24:49.025 --> 24:53.691
And when I was about ten years old, I got folio,

24:54.329 --> 24:57.392
So I was out of school for a year.

24:57.432 --> 25:03.117
My grandfather would take me to my exercises, and then I hung around with him.

25:03.617 --> 25:10.864
And so when I was 10, I was going to George Allen's book shop at McManus.

25:10.884 --> 25:15.268
And in Philadelphia, I was going to Baldwin's book form.

25:15.288 --> 25:15.909
So you're from Philly.

25:16.329 --> 25:19.172
I'm from Wilmington, Delaware.

25:19.352 --> 25:22.935
And I was reading book catalogs, and my grandfather

25:23.455 --> 25:35.629
His great enthusiasm was anti-slavery history, and he did some publications, Delaware history.

25:36.550 --> 25:43.058
And he had rooms in his house that were just every wall with that book.

25:43.258 --> 25:45.360
He had them stream all over the floor.

25:46.141 --> 25:52.028
He lived in an old-fashioned sort of gentlemanly style.

25:52.717 --> 25:56.382
And he'd have formal new dinner.

25:56.402 --> 26:00.427
And he would dress and have soap.

26:00.627 --> 26:07.455
And I would go over and sit in a civilized environment.

26:08.216 --> 26:13.723
He'd get up to the mailbox.

26:13.743 --> 26:20.732
He'd get the book catalog, and he would sit there, even though more or less dinner would stop for a little bit.

26:21.168 --> 26:23.892
and he would read the book catalog.

26:23.912 --> 26:27.176
He'd go over and pick up the phone and call in the organ.

26:27.357 --> 26:30.321
That was in my blood.

26:30.421 --> 26:36.890
Do you collect personally or do you get enough satisfaction?

26:36.910 --> 26:41.256
I only collect rare books here.

26:42.077 --> 26:44.160
I'm a PhD in history.

26:44.180 --> 26:45.302
I write books.

26:45.907 --> 26:51.373
I pursue research, so I collect reference types of music.

26:51.513 --> 26:56.920
But no, I sort of feel my home is not an ideal environment.

26:57.821 --> 27:01.245
Before I came here, I was an art collector.

27:01.265 --> 27:10.936
I really think, though, if I analyzed my collecting, I was collecting almost as a deal in the course.

27:11.276 --> 27:12.257
I would get far.

27:12.678 --> 27:13.559
I would get to do it.

27:13.599 --> 27:15.441
You know, one liked that, a lot of that.

27:16.130 --> 27:18.953
You know, he loves the wheeling and dealing.

27:19.874 --> 27:41.715
And you know, what I would say in my own collection for the library, I think one of the strengths that I have, or one of the things that makes me find so many treasures, is that I feel a very close relationship with the trade.

27:41.965 --> 27:50.059
I have my best friends, I mean my best friends in the world, several of them are the dealers.

27:50.780 --> 27:55.868
I can go out, and I go out with dealers on science.

27:55.888 --> 28:05.104
I can do that because I can, I understand their, I don't have to have to grab everything myself.

28:05.337 --> 28:08.282
And we have a nice sort of relationship.

28:08.302 --> 28:14.552
But so many librarians in the standard library don't understand the church.

28:14.772 --> 28:18.518
I'm going to give you a quote.

28:18.618 --> 28:19.760
I actually had a question.

28:19.840 --> 28:22.124
Jackson was the best friend of Jackson.

28:22.224 --> 28:26.451
He was the best friend of Yale ever had because he was too elusive.

28:29.755 --> 28:33.500
So they offered good things to Yale as an old artist, you know.

28:33.980 --> 28:36.043
I mean, it's basically that kind of situation.

28:36.744 --> 28:57.349
I better not say, name names, but I can say that I get a lot of things that would go elsewhere except that those other places, if the dealer feels humiliated, feels hassled,

28:57.903 --> 29:04.531
in one way or another by some other librarian, and they just don't want it.

29:04.551 --> 29:08.316
Now, I will bargain, will appeal, and that's it.

29:08.336 --> 29:11.660
But it's a bargain if I honestly believe there was a lie.

29:12.701 --> 29:22.813
But I thoroughly understand respect, and I suppose if I were not a librarian here, what I would be would be a book dealer.

29:23.317 --> 29:29.563
because I've got... I have the passion and the understanding.

29:29.883 --> 29:46.098
I know that I could go and set myself up in New York City and could just by attending the Sutterby University sales could make more money in a year times two than my salary.

29:46.238 --> 29:47.839
Oh, absolutely.

29:48.400 --> 29:50.742
But it's fantastic.

29:51.194 --> 29:56.262
The joy of hearing is that you collect and it becomes a permanent part of the collection you have.

29:56.363 --> 30:00.009
You see that non-stop person.

30:00.109 --> 30:02.693
I've been director here long enough.

30:02.713 --> 30:14.232
I don't think there is one shelf in any whim here that I know there is a book that I haven't, although I can't remember anything practical in my life.

30:15.325 --> 30:27.460
When I go into a bookshop, I can just look.

30:27.801 --> 30:34.029
As almost every collector I know, you look at the shelves and you already know half the titles.

30:34.169 --> 30:37.013
I can do a bookstore very quickly.

30:37.033 --> 30:39.696
20,000, 30,000.

30:39.963 --> 30:43.428
I can find what I'm looking for very quickly.

30:43.468 --> 30:47.193
The eye knows what it's looking for, and we do so.

30:47.753 --> 30:52.420
The eye is processing what you already have, which is the question you get.

30:52.480 --> 31:02.613
Well, you know, the thing that I love about the Columbus... Let me go back and say one thing we started off.

31:02.633 --> 31:05.577
And that is, you know, where you say there's a continuity.

31:05.597 --> 31:09.362
Too good, I don't want to miss anything.

31:09.882 --> 31:26.581
Well Clements, this library from its inception has always been within the environment of a top flight university, graduate training level university.

31:27.643 --> 31:34.811
So for me, I have an academic history background.

31:34.831 --> 31:38.455
So whenever there is something that comes up,

31:38.637 --> 31:50.509
The question that I always ask, and Howard always asked, and Randolph Adams always asked, of that book was, does it have research value?

31:52.231 --> 32:00.600
We are not collecting, we don't have a rare book collection, which is based on value or beauty alone.

32:01.581 --> 32:05.225
And that makes us very different from some of these other libraries.

32:05.845 --> 32:08.408
We also, from the very beginning,

32:08.928 --> 32:19.541
I mean, within his first two years of collecting, he had made a decision that his interest was American history from the period of exploration.

32:19.561 --> 32:25.528
He sort of lost interest after War of 1812, personally.

32:25.768 --> 32:35.880
Although the library, Randolph Adams was collecting the whole war, and he even collected the World Wars.

32:36.232 --> 32:46.206
Essentially, today, we are collecting discovery through the end of the 19th century.

32:46.226 --> 32:48.089
See, A&Fs believe we were here.

32:48.109 --> 32:49.671
They cut off.

32:49.691 --> 32:52.815
Howard Peckham had a cutoff.

32:53.957 --> 32:55.419
Randolph Adams did not.

32:56.280 --> 33:06.154
But Howard, Howard was always a little bit afraid of facing a potential addition to the building.

33:07.163 --> 33:09.568
So, and it's not a personal interest.

33:09.729 --> 33:23.620
So in the 50s and the 60s, our literature also had a good waiting of cutoff dates anywhere from 1825 up to 1865.

33:24.173 --> 33:27.537
But Howard didn't live by the cut-off phase either.

33:27.557 --> 33:33.083
Well, as you point out in your remarks out there, you can't ignore a package of opportunity.

33:33.423 --> 33:36.126
I mean, something really exciting presents itself.

33:36.847 --> 33:40.010
So it's two years outside of your scope.

33:41.132 --> 33:47.819
You may never see this thing again, and it's important to your scholars.

33:48.800 --> 33:53.505
So you know, when I do those things, I am

33:53.907 --> 33:57.472
thoroughly aware of where our library's strengths are.

33:57.492 --> 33:58.213
And so you build.

33:58.413 --> 34:01.497
But I build very carefully upon strengths.

34:01.738 --> 34:12.853
I don't go into some, you know, I wouldn't, just because it was a bargain or available, buy a collection of Oriental literature.

34:12.993 --> 34:14.756
But I would do it.

34:14.896 --> 34:23.087
I would either contact a university, which should be doing it, another part of this university, or a member of the trade.

34:23.877 --> 34:39.593
I mean, I feel that my job in sort of promoting rare books and such collections goes well beyond just this library.

34:39.613 --> 34:43.958
And I do feel I'm part of a larger world out there.

34:44.158 --> 34:49.984
I've never felt strongly competitive with any institutions.

34:50.004 --> 34:52.787
And in reality, use art very often in competition.

34:53.172 --> 34:56.056
even with the antiquarian society.

34:56.757 --> 35:11.316
Since I've been director, the only people... Martin Carson, as you know I'm sure well, he's as intensely collector-oriented as I am, or I am as he.

35:13.198 --> 35:15.361
Ed Wolfe was that way.

35:16.002 --> 35:17.003
And I used to...

35:17.557 --> 35:24.206
They only occasionally sort of have to do that, knowing, like, in an auction situation.

35:24.226 --> 35:25.167
Well, it happens.

35:26.449 --> 35:28.552
Look at the, you know, what you're doing.

35:28.572 --> 35:30.234
You're doing similar things.

35:30.254 --> 35:31.095
Yeah.

35:31.115 --> 35:35.601
Now, what is, what would you say your acquaintances?

35:35.722 --> 35:37.524
Is it preeminent in any of the situations?

35:38.866 --> 35:40.869
It's certainly, yeah, it is.

35:41.950 --> 35:47.057
It is absolutely preeminent in the field you've ever seen.

35:48.455 --> 35:55.506
Combined with our favorite resources and our managed pictures first.

35:55.746 --> 36:10.569
Summers, when he set this place, not proud of it as a rare book collection, but in the first of the 20s, they managed to, he already had one major revolutionary war here, a collection of papers of Lord Sheldon.

36:11.751 --> 36:15.897
But in the 20s, they managed to, he and Adams,

36:16.636 --> 36:30.774
where there's the Gage papers, the Clinton papers, the Germain papers, and a variety of books, which are really the archives of the British Army during the original abolition.

36:31.896 --> 36:40.467
And he got from Saban, the book dealers of State, he got from the Daniel Queen papers on the American side.

36:40.970 --> 36:46.938
So any good scholar of the American Revolution comes into the book.

36:46.958 --> 36:58.292
Would you say, is it a fair assessment that the East Coast would have, let's say, I think it's happening at the Morgan in New York.

36:58.312 --> 37:03.879
Are you really the institution they would bring to the coast?

37:04.120 --> 37:08.165
I think you can add the Newberry in there in its various gifts.

37:08.706 --> 37:10.588
You know, the Newberry, the Huntington,

37:11.024 --> 37:19.134
And the Morgans, combined with the Houghton, that's a sort of rare book.

37:19.175 --> 37:20.376
Made up rare book.

37:20.596 --> 37:23.160
Well, a New York public library.

37:23.180 --> 37:27.325
Yeah, that's Lennox with that Americana.

37:27.345 --> 37:29.067
Every one of them is collected.

37:29.768 --> 37:39.681
But those libraries, Lennox and it, see, I would say Lennox and Mr. Clement, the Lennox Americana.

37:40.471 --> 37:57.532
the Clements library and the John Carter Brown, and then the Folgers library, are more similar in being subject-oriented from the beginning as the collection developed.

37:57.552 --> 38:08.065
It's kind of unique in America too, isn't it, to have these institutions where you are affiliated with a university, but particularly the capital of the Folgers library.

38:08.568 --> 38:22.183
Yeah, I mean, we're talking about collectives who set up an institution.

38:22.203 --> 38:28.309
Well, next collectives, really, not near that anywhere else in the world.

38:28.329 --> 38:31.012
Think of any other place where you have an institution that has emerged research institutions.

38:31.032 --> 38:33.735
No, it's phenomenal.

38:33.755 --> 38:35.537
And that's a fair assessment, isn't it?

38:35.652 --> 38:36.654
I think so.

38:36.674 --> 38:41.341
I mean, there may be a few institutions elsewhere.

38:43.424 --> 38:54.320
There certainly are some special collections libraries elsewhere in the world that are identified with a ballpark or even the British Library or the British Museum.

38:54.921 --> 38:58.426
But that was in its initial, it's not the same.

38:59.728 --> 39:04.275
It's not, nor do you have that, I don't think you have that situation where

39:04.998 --> 39:16.530
one man in his lifetime was able to do so much that he could create a mature vision before he died.

39:18.212 --> 39:20.655
You mentioned that you have the book.

39:20.675 --> 39:21.035
Yes.

39:21.255 --> 39:28.844
Do you have any, all collectors have formed members of their great tribe.

39:28.864 --> 39:32.728
Do you have similar experiences?

39:33.549 --> 39:34.870
Oh, many, many.

39:35.069 --> 39:48.783
Well, you know, you can get this kind of satisfaction at so many levels.

39:48.943 --> 40:04.840
It's fun to, when you have a great item, appear even at one of the major auctions and to line up your funds and get it

40:05.242 --> 40:09.008
so you're able to succeed again.

40:09.068 --> 40:28.156
The comments, an example of that was getting one of the hack atlaces, which we acquired from the Houghton collection, which was sold in the late 70s.

40:28.176 --> 40:33.865
Arthur Houghton, and he had, the public library, you asked about preeminence,

40:34.418 --> 40:41.604
The Clemens Library has his final collection of early American maps.

40:42.245 --> 40:49.591
We have more manuscript maps of the Revolution than any other library in the United States.

40:49.691 --> 40:55.836
It's a spectacular collection of maps.

40:56.336 --> 41:04.223
And so, because it is a strong collection, I really go all the way to try to fill in the Gattons when we get one.

41:05.063 --> 41:11.571
Well, one area that's very poorly represented in printed maps is the west coast of South America.

41:13.053 --> 41:34.378
And there were a series of atlases done by a noted London mapmaker named William Pack in the 1680s and 90s, which were largely based on charts captured by a group of pirates in 1681.

41:35.050 --> 41:37.373
Oh, it's wonderful.

41:37.393 --> 41:45.203
And Putin owns two of these batteries, and they're the last two that would ever be available.

41:45.223 --> 42:01.463
So I was sitting in my office, and my map curator came up and just sort of wishfully said, oh, you know, those facts are coming up in three or four days.

42:02.725 --> 42:05.468
And I said, well, we've never seen the Cadillac.

42:05.488 --> 42:08.411
And we discovered our subscription.

42:08.431 --> 42:09.812
The subscription had run out.

42:10.793 --> 42:17.860
So I said, well, look, go on over to the main library and see if you can borrow the Cadillac.

42:17.880 --> 42:19.081
And he brought it over.

42:19.101 --> 42:30.673
And I'm not sure, but that maybe because I had such a short time to do this, I was willing to go so far out on a limb.

42:31.565 --> 42:37.551
But I looked at it, and I figured out how much cash I could come up with.

42:37.571 --> 42:45.499
And I figured I had about $40,000, and the estimates were maybe $15,000 to $25,000.

42:45.519 --> 42:48.382
But I thought, well, I could at least spend a bit.

42:48.402 --> 42:49.423
Did you say I might have more money?

42:49.763 --> 42:56.610
Well, what I had to do, when I started going to something very big, I had to go and get permission.

42:57.147 --> 43:01.672
of my committee of marriage, then I go to the president of the university.

43:01.812 --> 43:02.953
I go around and ask.

43:03.634 --> 43:10.021
They have universally always been go-getting, supportive, positive.

43:10.742 --> 43:11.522
Thank God.

43:11.542 --> 43:14.766
I mean, I wouldn't be here if they weren't.

43:14.786 --> 43:21.413
So I went around and got, and I am one of these people I'm so enthusiastic about for.

43:21.593 --> 43:27.019
When I go and talk to somebody, my enthusiasm passes off the person back at me.

43:27.657 --> 43:37.549
So I encouraged myself, and the more I thought about it, the more excited I thought, the more I decided we had it really done for it.

43:38.530 --> 43:52.106
So, one of the last persons, after I made the rounds, I called the man who was the chairman of our sessions, and his name was Jim Schultz, F-C-H-O-S-M.

43:52.446 --> 43:54.829
He was a, had been,

43:55.552 --> 44:13.962
recently retired president of Bloomsdale, the finest man I all have ever met, wonderful friend and advisor, and a great collector, Civil War material and Revolutionary War.

44:15.224 --> 44:19.551
And so I found him, and he

44:19.666 --> 44:23.791
He was an enthusiast, one guy.

44:24.071 --> 44:24.431
Oh.

44:24.492 --> 44:26.694
Yeah, so it was a function, you know.

44:27.195 --> 44:33.161
Yeah, what he said, he said, well, look, he said, what you gotta do.

44:33.862 --> 44:39.088
We had also put out theories to do it in this century might go for it.

44:39.108 --> 44:44.795
And came up with the realization, well, really none of the libraries were going to do it.

44:45.455 --> 44:47.698
But the dealers and the private forces

44:49.248 --> 44:58.784
And we came back and we sort of realized that Crouch was likely to go for pretty for something.

45:00.567 --> 45:11.845
So I talked to Jim Shope, and Jim was a very tasty guy, and he said, well, you ought to go to one of your competitors.

45:11.945 --> 45:13.568
Go to Paul's.

45:13.588 --> 45:14.710
Crouch was in London.

45:15.030 --> 45:16.032
I saw that off.

45:16.433 --> 45:21.999
But he said, hire him to buy it for you, and then you've eliminated one of them.

45:22.099 --> 45:24.962
You're no competitor.

45:24.982 --> 45:34.032
So I had never personally gotten with Krauss before, but I got his number, and I called him, and got him on the phone and loved him.

45:34.272 --> 45:43.082
And I asked him what he felt he would need to bring to make a serious difference.

45:43.670 --> 45:50.380
And I have, in this process, have worked my life from 40 to 70.

45:50.400 --> 45:51.121
All right.

45:51.141 --> 46:01.335
Paul said that I wouldn't go into it unless I had a hundred dollars.

46:01.355 --> 46:04.480
Then I'd make a couple calls back.

46:04.560 --> 46:06.042
He felt it was that extraordinary.

46:06.603 --> 46:08.766
Well, he thought it would bring that kind of money.

46:10.649 --> 46:12.411
And so I...

46:14.365 --> 46:18.912
Jim Shope and I now were both deeply into that.

46:19.413 --> 46:34.455
And Jim, of course, was not only an advisor, but a benefactor who could help out and could whip up the enthusiasm on the part of our friends group to make the papers and get a consortium.

46:34.896 --> 46:43.208
Yeah, so, you know, if Jim gave his, he was in many ways the most important person to give green light.

46:43.728 --> 46:48.154
So he said, well, if he needs 100, you've got to get him 100.

46:48.174 --> 47:01.190
So we, I talked a little bit more, and people were willing to let me go on 100, and we just figured out where we can find the money.

47:01.411 --> 47:03.033
So I called Krauss.

47:04.214 --> 47:09.741
The last time I talked to Sheldon, he said, well, you know, all right, he said you needed 100,000.

47:09.761 --> 47:11.203
He said, give him 120,000.

47:12.938 --> 47:24.214
So I bid, I called Krauss to hand a hundred, I mean our bid would be 125, but Schatz added one ticket in his post, which is the result of a white debt.

47:24.754 --> 47:36.471
He said, you know, we're 125, but then asked him that if he buys a consult above that figure, would he give you post-reputation to buy?

47:37.753 --> 47:40.056
And I added that when I made my bid.

47:40.396 --> 47:40.937
I said,

47:41.356 --> 47:44.440
that could leave the office.

47:44.480 --> 47:48.124
If you die, it could leave the office.

47:48.144 --> 48:08.167
So the sale took place literally the next day, and I got a call from Mrs. Krause immediately after the sale, and she said that the item cost, well, but it was all wrong.

48:08.588 --> 48:09.709
We're talking about

48:10.347 --> 48:15.632
The 125 has figured in the commission, but they have a 10%.

48:15.812 --> 48:17.254
It included .

48:19.656 --> 48:26.282
Well, she called in including the commission, she's done across the 144 .

48:27.604 --> 48:29.445
Are you in?

48:30.386 --> 48:35.732
And I didn't dare put the phone on hold for a fair reason to recall.

48:35.752 --> 48:39.375
But I said, one minute, and I can tell the fellows

48:40.081 --> 48:45.408
And so I called.

48:46.530 --> 49:01.971
I mean, I picked it up and I said yes sir.

49:03.419 --> 49:06.864
Well, we were $90,000 short in cash to pay for this.

49:07.184 --> 49:09.547
And this was a long one.

49:09.567 --> 49:11.189
There wasn't a lot of money involved.

49:11.890 --> 49:13.933
But it wasn't with a clutch period.

49:14.113 --> 49:16.977
So you had 50.

49:17.158 --> 49:19.100
And I went over to the university.

49:19.381 --> 49:25.108
I had done this, and I went to see the controller of the university and the president.

49:25.128 --> 49:28.232
They lent me the extra.

49:29.034 --> 49:30.135
They won the check.

49:30.706 --> 49:33.731
with the idea that what we didn't have was a weapon.

49:35.433 --> 49:38.098
And then we started to beat the bushes.

49:38.238 --> 49:40.421
And yeah, I'll read our books.

49:40.441 --> 49:42.164
We got it on the front page.

49:42.184 --> 49:46.591
We had the first page of the Detroit News, first page of the Detroit Free Press.

49:47.332 --> 49:49.896
I had two television interviews on this.

49:50.497 --> 49:52.520
The Pirate Atlas, you know.

49:52.660 --> 49:53.722
It was very exciting.

49:53.802 --> 49:54.483
Oh, sure.

49:54.503 --> 49:56.166
Oh, whoa.

49:57.027 --> 49:58.890
And believe it or not,

49:59.225 --> 50:10.698
I went to a foundation in Detroit, the McGregor Fund, which Tracy McGregor was on our board for the McGregor Room at UVA.

50:10.998 --> 50:13.861
For him, he was a great book collector.

50:13.901 --> 50:18.566
But the McGregor Fund has always been very supportive of Martin Arbery.

50:19.247 --> 50:22.451
They gave me a $25,000 action grant.

50:22.571 --> 50:24.954
I got one in several places.

50:24.974 --> 50:28.978
In six months, we were able to raise

50:29.228 --> 50:37.240
every penny for that atlas, and that the atlas became not, the university did not come one cent for that.

50:37.260 --> 50:44.010
So, to go back to my question, this is about an example of satisfaction.

50:44.030 --> 50:44.130
Yeah.

50:44.631 --> 50:45.753
That's going to be a great offer.

50:45.893 --> 50:46.454
Of this.

50:46.754 --> 50:51.401
And you know, that atlas people just won't buy your file, I don't know if you have any treasures.

50:52.102 --> 50:53.524
That's one kind of satisfaction.

50:53.544 --> 50:54.606
Let me show it to you.

50:54.626 --> 50:58.071
Give me a chance just to talk about paper.

50:59.637 --> 51:05.566
Okay, you see, here it is.

51:05.906 --> 51:06.547
Here it is.

51:10.333 --> 51:17.784
It's the... This copy belongs to the Grenville family, who were great 18th century collectors.

51:18.705 --> 51:24.453
That is the book plate of the very prime minister who was in when the Sam Pact occurred.

51:24.473 --> 51:26.877
There's Arthur Houghton's complaint.

51:31.008 --> 51:42.245
And then it's full of these sort of AIA triptychs up and down the coast.

51:42.385 --> 51:43.848
This is the original binding?

51:43.908 --> 51:48.595
This is the original 17th century.

51:49.334 --> 51:51.217
Beautiful ship, beautiful paper.

51:51.257 --> 51:52.078
All right.

51:52.279 --> 51:54.101
All right.

51:54.222 --> 51:56.205
Here, wait a minute.

51:56.485 --> 51:57.306
Let me take that.

51:57.507 --> 51:59.971
Let me, because it has such a thing.

52:00.011 --> 52:04.458
Let me take, wait a minute, if I can find it.

52:04.558 --> 52:09.265
It's the same detail.

52:09.285 --> 52:09.866
Isn't it great?

52:10.006 --> 52:13.672
How is this listed in the catalog?

52:13.692 --> 52:16.877
See, it's called the Hack Atlas.

52:18.072 --> 52:46.206
H.A.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.C.

52:46.928 --> 52:52.994
And they hand about vaulting copies made for the leading politicians to save their lives.

52:55.017 --> 52:56.138
You know, they're broad.

52:56.258 --> 53:05.988
So every copy belongs to the king, belongs to the future king, belong to Lord somebody or Lord somebody else.

53:06.889 --> 53:10.413
There are about two or three copies of the British Library.

53:10.473 --> 53:11.995
The Huntington has one.

53:12.715 --> 53:15.298
There are a few copies around.

53:15.599 --> 53:17.961
But it was our only shot to get one.

53:17.981 --> 53:20.204
How many have you got together to say?

53:20.224 --> 53:24.287
I believe there are nine or 10 hacks.

53:24.328 --> 53:26.570
I know.

53:26.590 --> 53:29.873
And every one is different.

53:29.893 --> 53:39.142
And if they say, if you spend $150,000 for that, add a zero to it, that's probably a $1.5 million dollar book.

53:40.083 --> 53:42.185
It's entirely possible.

53:42.325 --> 53:43.166
We add a zero.

53:43.446 --> 53:45.268
Yeah, that's the rule of thumb.

53:46.092 --> 54:04.248
I'd love to do that.

54:04.308 --> 54:07.695
Give me a chance just to put the tape on the other side.
