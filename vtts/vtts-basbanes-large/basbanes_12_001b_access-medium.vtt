WEBVTT

00:02.815 --> 00:04.357
Isn't that wonderful?

00:05.038 --> 00:07.420
Okay, we're talking to William Gass here in St.

00:07.480 --> 00:07.641
Louis.

00:08.281 --> 00:09.042
Don't mind about it.

00:09.122 --> 00:10.023
They're all your words.

00:10.884 --> 00:11.565
And we're watching it.

00:12.486 --> 00:13.227
There it goes.

00:13.407 --> 00:18.032
Yeah, and I always wanted to have my own library.

00:18.853 --> 00:20.215
I'm not a collector.

00:22.077 --> 00:23.679
But you have 12,000 books somewhere.

00:23.699 --> 00:24.940
Yeah, it's an accumulator.

00:24.960 --> 00:26.182
An accumulator.

00:26.382 --> 00:26.582
Okay.

00:27.103 --> 00:31.708
It's, I don't think one would find many

00:32.768 --> 01:01.054
really rare or ununique or something books in all of this I mean a few but nothing really on the whole I just have gotten out to a place where I really have a working library I'm at home with my books and almost everything that I need is at hand and that is just my idea of total you know luxury and

01:01.338 --> 01:06.646
The book I just finished, which is coming out this fall, and the title is Every Book It's Reader.

01:07.368 --> 01:11.174
The Power of the Printed Word to Stir the World, Not to Change the World.

01:11.194 --> 01:13.677
That's a little, that's reaching a bit too much.

01:13.718 --> 01:15.540
But books that make things happen.

01:16.622 --> 01:26.097
But one of the goals for me in this book was to be able to try and do it with all the books that were available and at hand, within reach, in my home.

01:26.347 --> 01:33.296
After all these years of putting together not 20,000 books, but let's say 10,000 or 15,000 books, the Lord knows how many there are.

01:33.677 --> 01:45.452
But to try at this point in my life to use what I had, and especially the literary biographies and the works of criticism, your Wilker book, for instance, which is a few years old, and I said, finally, I have a chance to use it, you know?

01:45.472 --> 01:46.053
Oh, yeah.

01:46.453 --> 01:48.396
And it was wonderful.

01:48.596 --> 01:51.259
It was just wonderful to finally say, oh, I've got a book on that.

01:51.500 --> 01:52.221
Oh, yeah.

01:52.241 --> 01:54.484
To just follow... Oh, yeah.

01:54.544 --> 01:56.286
That's all...

01:56.772 --> 02:05.301
I mean, um, I have, I just finished, I've been doing a series of pieces for Harper's, and I just finished one on Nietzsche.

02:06.322 --> 02:10.847
Uh, well, when I wanted to write on Nietzsche, I just went to the basement.

02:10.867 --> 02:16.793
We have stacks in the basement and stacks in the first floor and all the second floor and so forth.

02:17.273 --> 02:24.501
And so I just went and gathered up an armload of books, you know, and took them up there, and I had all that I needed.

02:24.717 --> 02:31.406
And that kind of thing, when I did the piece on Rabelais, I was a little lucky.

02:32.427 --> 02:36.532
We have what we call various rooms, the French room, the German room.

02:36.553 --> 02:37.293
Really?

02:37.454 --> 02:41.859
Mary's favorite room is the French room, which is just French literature.

02:42.881 --> 02:45.825
German is in our bedroom.

02:47.026 --> 02:52.193
And I just...

02:52.628 --> 03:00.777
went there and I happened to have an old, beat-up, terrible copy.

03:01.597 --> 03:05.121
The pages are all brittle and brown.

03:05.241 --> 03:07.724
It's just awfully cheap piece of stuff.

03:08.565 --> 03:14.991
I think I bought it in a little bookstore in Paris forever ago and never used it.

03:15.852 --> 03:21.218
And my French isn't all that great, but I wanted to look at the original.

03:22.109 --> 03:26.053
because these were translations of Gargantua and Pettigrew.

03:27.135 --> 03:38.247
And I—this book happened to be an annotated version with notations for each of the changes and each of the editions.

03:38.287 --> 03:38.587
Really?

03:39.428 --> 03:41.311
And it was perfect for me, you know.

03:41.331 --> 03:43.994
And it was this book, which I never thought I would ever use.

03:45.075 --> 03:48.859
I had a book that I—Mary says, what do you say to me?

03:49.075 --> 03:50.557
book on histology?

03:50.738 --> 03:51.519
I mean, what is it?

03:52.140 --> 03:56.868
Well, it came in handy from my novel, The Tunnel.

03:57.208 --> 04:03.578
I used it for diagrams and all kinds of stuff, and never thought I'd, you know.

04:04.119 --> 04:09.548
So my belief is every book is, you know,

04:09.798 --> 04:16.524
a sacred object, and it's going to—you never know, and it's going to leap into your heart.

04:16.684 --> 04:17.685
Every book gets reader.

04:18.305 --> 04:25.792
If only one person reads the book through the course of its existence, it serves its function, hasn't it?

04:26.633 --> 04:27.834
Oh, help yourself.

04:27.894 --> 04:30.576
I'll just have a little coffee for a bit.

04:31.137 --> 04:33.038
I don't know what these things are.

04:35.100 --> 04:38.463
When you were writing The Tunnel, and you had this book on histology, is it?

04:38.543 --> 04:39.484
Yes.

04:39.903 --> 04:44.887
Which came first, the need for the book on histology, or the fact that you had it?

04:44.967 --> 04:46.209
No, I just had it.

04:46.709 --> 04:59.480
I just had this, I saw this book, and of course I'm great on cheap, because we don't have that much money to buy books, so we have to buy them when they don't cost anything.

05:00.341 --> 05:02.883
And I was fascinated by the drawings in it.

05:03.884 --> 05:08.188
And then I just put it on the shelf, and it sat there for twenty years, at least.

05:08.962 --> 05:22.566
And then I wanted an image for the final page of the novel, and I thought, anus, that's what I need.

05:23.103 --> 05:29.789
And there was, in that book, a beautiful drawing which I could reproduce.

05:31.571 --> 05:32.412
You never know.

05:32.452 --> 05:39.058
It came right out of your... I wish I'd had this anecdote two months ago, let me tell you.

05:39.599 --> 05:46.906
It's the perfect illustration of exactly the kind of thing I'm looking for is how your books really energize your own creative... your books.

05:47.046 --> 05:48.207
Oh, yeah.

05:49.028 --> 05:52.992
Well, and they give you all kinds of ideas, like...

05:53.157 --> 06:04.854
We emptied out at one time, many years ago again, an attic that belonged to my wife's grandparents.

06:04.874 --> 06:22.641
And it was sets of the new century, of Harper's going back to 1865, 78, but also some that included Henry James' pieces and things like that.

06:24.089 --> 06:40.230
And I've been thinking about and I'm going to do a piece on a piece of fiction that works out of the ads in these old magazines because they are a story all by themselves.

06:41.212 --> 06:45.257
And so I've been taking a few notes and working up.

06:45.277 --> 06:50.263
So here are these bunch of old magazines which are now going to do something.

06:50.924 --> 06:52.206
You know, you never know what

06:52.422 --> 06:54.284
what will give you an idea.

06:54.305 --> 07:00.012
Is it fair to say that a good deal of your creative process emerges from your reading?

07:00.072 --> 07:01.274
Almost all of it.

07:01.454 --> 07:01.815
Really?

07:02.015 --> 07:04.038
Yeah.

07:04.779 --> 07:12.409
In the tunnel I used a little, some material, not much, that's autobiographical.

07:14.351 --> 07:17.816
But, for instance, people constantly do this with me.

07:18.557 --> 07:20.860
They say, gee, you must know a lot about gardening.

07:21.599 --> 07:31.614
My wife is a wonderful gardener, but because of all these plants and a whole, this paragraph about weeds and stuff.

07:31.634 --> 07:34.258
And I said, no, I'm just collecting it.

07:34.278 --> 07:35.359
Gardening catalogs.

07:37.382 --> 07:39.685
I collect book catalogs, and it's amazing.

07:39.706 --> 07:42.269
And people are, they say, what do you find out about this?

07:42.289 --> 07:44.412
And I say, read the bookseller's catalogs.

07:44.432 --> 07:45.514
Read the auction catalog.

07:46.287 --> 08:09.662
you hire all of these bibliographers and these researchers to get all this detail and the history of the book the provenance the ownership it's amazing the detail that you can get from catalogs that you can't get i mean that's where the professionals are applying their trade that's right preparation of these so it's not only the reading of great creative works but also the reading of

08:10.283 --> 08:35.177
stand near anything or anything but i also providence my providence is again because of fatigue is i buy a lot of books we're going to have our big cultural event in st louis in a few days the book fair and there'll be a million books and it's almost literature oh it's a great thing i mean it is wonderful uh and you do get

08:36.558 --> 08:38.881
great bargains now and then.

08:38.901 --> 08:58.846
I mean, I picked up a copy of Joseph in Egypt, and I was looking at it, and it was a buck, and then I saw that it was signed to his hostess when Thomas Mann came through in the thirties, and I bought this book.

08:59.426 --> 09:03.912
It's one of my goodies in my library.

09:04.673 --> 09:06.295
Hemingway, similarly.

09:06.747 --> 09:10.832
pick up Paul Valery in French here.

09:11.412 --> 09:15.477
Wouldn't you love to know where they came from?

09:15.497 --> 09:15.737
Yes.

09:16.138 --> 09:18.000
How things wash up.

09:18.460 --> 09:31.155
I remember buying a copy of Santillana's The Sense of Beauty in a goodwill over here someplace for a quarter, and I thought, how did it wash up on these shores?

09:31.255 --> 09:36.501
You know, that's exactly the image that Charles Lamb uses.

09:36.802 --> 09:40.448
referring to Coleridge, how he takes books and he never returns them.

09:40.828 --> 09:45.256
But he said, for just as many books as he takes, he brings in like a tiger.

09:45.556 --> 09:46.357
Oh, I see.

09:47.038 --> 09:53.629
So just as many wonderful things as you lose, he will bring books that he brought from someplace else and he'll deposit them.

09:53.947 --> 09:57.373
And of course, Coleridge was the great annotator of books as well.

09:57.393 --> 09:58.014
Oh, that's right.

09:58.294 --> 10:02.962
And I have a little riff on him in my new book, one of the things that he wrote.

10:02.982 --> 10:04.264
I think it's Princeton.

10:04.285 --> 10:07.069
It's published in eight volumes of his Marginalia.

10:07.430 --> 10:11.016
Oh, there's that book that came out recently.

10:11.136 --> 10:11.717
Marginalia.

10:11.817 --> 10:12.518
Marginalia.

10:12.659 --> 10:14.622
I interviewed her for the book.

10:15.277 --> 10:17.279
Heather Jackson in Toronto.

10:17.460 --> 10:18.060
She's wonderful.

10:18.140 --> 10:25.309
She has a new one coming from Yale soon, in a couple of months, called Romantic Readers, a companion volume.

10:27.071 --> 10:34.340
Books in the British Library, people reading in the Romantic era, and the impressions of their reading that they left.

10:34.540 --> 10:38.465
Of course, when you talk about marginalia to librarians, they go crazy.

10:38.505 --> 10:39.806
Oh, sure.

10:39.826 --> 10:42.229
But that's why I love the provenance thing, because

10:43.255 --> 10:48.400
in these cheap books I buy at the book fair sometimes.

10:50.403 --> 11:01.134
Old marks, you know, you'll see in crayon, two dollars crossed out, one dollar under it crossed out, fifty cents crossed out.

11:01.594 --> 11:02.195
I love that.

11:03.156 --> 11:04.518
I do too.

11:04.958 --> 11:11.625
Or all the names or who an old book plate or things that

11:12.314 --> 11:14.877
Also, of course, the stuff that you shake out of them.

11:15.398 --> 11:16.499
Well, the book is artifact.

11:16.579 --> 11:21.325
I mean, this is really my fundamental interest of the book as object.

11:21.345 --> 11:30.757
It's not just the content, which of course is what the exercise seems to be about, but how the book is... I tell the story often.

11:30.817 --> 11:39.688
I may even write a children's book about this at some point, but at the Library of Congress they have a copy of Kirkham's Grammar, which is a self-help...

11:40.225 --> 11:43.609
teach yourself how to read and write and type of a thing.

11:43.629 --> 11:44.731
Not even a first edition.

11:44.791 --> 11:47.775
If you saw it at the fair here, you wouldn't pay 25 cents for it.

11:48.836 --> 11:49.677
Read to tatters.

11:50.578 --> 11:54.123
The only distinguishing thing is the prior ownership signature of Abraham Lincoln.

11:54.343 --> 11:59.550
And the fact that it's the earliest known book that has been in his hands, and it is the book that

11:59.767 --> 12:04.292
is that when he arrived in New Salem, he walked eight miles to get the book.

12:04.352 --> 12:19.387
If you handle it as I have and you feel the tingle, you know, from these pages, it could emerge the Gettysburg Address, the Emancipation Proclamation, and, you know, the feeling of that, the energy that comes from holding a book like that.

12:19.407 --> 12:20.468
Yeah, yeah.

12:20.888 --> 12:24.071
I thought that would make a pretty good kid's book, a little children's book.

12:24.091 --> 12:25.312
Oh, yeah, it would.

12:25.333 --> 12:26.854
Maybe my wife and I.

12:27.239 --> 12:30.723
two weeks, two days, that I might work on.

12:31.864 --> 12:35.789
So are you looking for anything special when you go, when you go looking for books, or is it serendipity?

12:35.809 --> 12:39.693
No, it's totally, especially at the book fair.

12:41.756 --> 12:51.127
But no, it's, I have, of course, I keep an eye on for certain books that I tend to really collect, in a sense.

12:51.227 --> 12:56.773
James, anything, or Rilke, or Stein, or, there are a few people.

12:58.272 --> 13:06.002
Wyndham Lewis or, oh, what's that, Malcolm Lowry.

13:07.324 --> 13:11.829
When I was in Canada, I was busy getting Malcolm Lowry stuff.

13:12.791 --> 13:16.275
But I'm not really trying to get first edition so much.

13:16.315 --> 13:16.976
No, I understand.

13:17.317 --> 13:17.597
I prefer that.

13:17.617 --> 13:18.959
This is really my interest, too.

13:19.099 --> 13:19.940
Right, I prefer that.

13:20.040 --> 13:25.427
You know, it's nice, but— It's nice if you can— I want the text, because I use the text.

13:26.403 --> 13:28.086
Do you write in your books?

13:28.106 --> 13:29.027
Do you have annotations?

13:29.047 --> 13:29.668
I used to.

13:29.949 --> 13:31.091
I don't much anymore.

13:31.111 --> 13:35.057
I use sticky little things.

13:37.381 --> 13:42.750
But it's just simply, it's not that I have a particular objection to it or anything.

13:43.351 --> 13:46.275
It's just that I don't have time.

13:46.295 --> 13:49.460
I think the sticky things are good because it marks it for you.

13:49.521 --> 13:49.801
Yeah.

13:49.921 --> 13:53.507
Instead of flipping through the book to find where you... I know in a review of books,

13:53.808 --> 13:58.774
from galleys or something, and I'll write in the thing, but then you have to put through it.

13:59.054 --> 14:01.056
Yeah, well that's what I do.

14:01.177 --> 14:04.981
And I use pretty big ones, and I can write on them, and then stick it there.

14:05.081 --> 14:07.924
But I hope you keep those things, because I think they're very important.

14:08.105 --> 14:11.288
They stay in the book, pretty much, and they go back up on the shelf.

14:11.769 --> 14:12.570
There they are.

14:14.232 --> 14:17.976
I tend to put books back before the damn fax checkers.

14:18.412 --> 14:27.482
phone me and say, well, you didn't give us the fact check on such and such, and so I can go back and find what I quoted from.

14:28.182 --> 14:30.325
Then I tag everything, I use it.

14:32.247 --> 14:35.230
But, yeah, I don't, it's sheer chance.

14:35.690 --> 14:47.963
So do you think a person who's not familiar with you, biographically, let's say, or has a knowledge of your writing, if this person were to come as an archaeologist, quote, through your

14:48.095 --> 14:53.723
French room and your German room, and would they be able to get a sense of you as an individual and as a writer?

14:54.565 --> 15:07.745
Uh, it might be a little hard because I collect a lot of writers that, and books that are not in my area, uh, or that I might not even be expected to like.

15:09.006 --> 15:16.718
Um, uh, simply because I think my library ought to have them.

15:17.120 --> 15:46.502
uh and uh so i i do and i'm and i'm surprising myself sometimes in actually using them uh but otherwise yeah because i i mean that's what i uh oh it's one of the autobiographical elements in the tunnel is the section uh where the narrator invokes the muse well i gave them

15:47.005 --> 16:12.439
the invocation is a hundred pages long and he needs all the help he can get and it's books his muses are books and that's true for me and so calling on you know whoever to come to your aid so

16:12.706 --> 16:14.008
And I like to keep books.

16:14.248 --> 16:15.369
I never throw them away.

16:15.409 --> 16:15.750
Never.

16:16.010 --> 16:17.171
You don't discard anything?

16:17.752 --> 16:40.178
No, because if I get a better copy of Hardy's Return of the Native, because my earlier one was a cheap paperback, it happened to be the first, one of the earliest paperbacks published, and it was one where I first read my first Hardy, I'm not going to give away, you know.

16:40.699 --> 16:42.561
Well, I'd argue in one of my books that

16:43.722 --> 16:49.471
Just because you get a new edition of the same, purportedly the same text, doesn't mean that they're the same.

16:49.771 --> 16:51.594
No, it certainly doesn't.

16:52.155 --> 16:57.984
There might be a really terrific introduction there that's useful to you, or the notes, whatever.

16:58.004 --> 17:04.714
I mean, the book, again, as artifact, has different paratextual elements to it, as they say.

17:04.834 --> 17:05.135
Right.

17:05.295 --> 17:07.759
And oddly enough, I have quite a few books.

17:09.381 --> 17:10.523
And it turned out to be...

17:11.178 --> 17:38.400
damaged in the sense of misprinted uh signature repeated signature dropped i have a malcolm lowry in which that's true um now that ruins the value of the book i suspect but not for me not for you well i have a few pirated ones too very interesting um i found in shanghai a pirated edition this was when i was in the navy in the war

17:39.646 --> 17:48.496
And I was stationed in Shanghai after the war, the Second World War, for a few months of Ulysses.

17:50.278 --> 17:53.281
And it's just, it was published in San Francisco.

17:54.042 --> 17:54.643
For what year?

17:56.305 --> 17:58.087
Because the first is... There's no date on it.

17:58.367 --> 18:00.069
No date.

18:00.089 --> 18:03.933
But it is, it's clearly published.

18:03.953 --> 18:04.214
1934?

18:04.734 --> 18:09.079
Yeah, and it's clearly a porn thing because it has porn.

18:09.616 --> 18:11.961
advertisements in the back, you know.

18:11.981 --> 18:12.602
That's great.

18:13.945 --> 18:18.435
And, you know, those are a few things.

18:18.996 --> 18:22.884
After years of hunting in bookstoles, you have luck now and then.

18:24.968 --> 18:26.050
But as I say, it's most popular.

18:26.071 --> 18:27.934
I found the Fifty Cents, and I loved it.

18:27.954 --> 18:29.177
Is it a copy of the

18:29.613 --> 18:37.261
I don't mean the first, who cares, but the family Shakespeare, you know, Thomas Bolder, the original Bolderization of Shakespeare.

18:37.762 --> 18:39.604
You know, you have to have that.

18:39.764 --> 18:54.861
I do a little thing on Bolderism in my new book, and how so much of what young readers get, when you think of Rabelais, I mean, how Rabelais has been really

18:56.056 --> 19:01.266
I guess Gulliver's Travels is a great example.

19:01.306 --> 19:06.435
I mean, if you read all of that, there could be some arguments for, you know, censoring it.

19:06.455 --> 19:07.397
Yeah, sure.

19:07.417 --> 19:17.736
But the various versions that have been made from little readers all the way up to adult readers and how much we get through the filtration of a translator or an editor.

19:17.937 --> 19:19.279
That's right.

19:19.968 --> 19:23.033
And that seems to me what was driving you in the Rilke book.

19:23.093 --> 19:26.998
You know, you really weren't happy with the translations that you were reading.

19:27.219 --> 19:31.625
No, and I had them all there, in my library.

19:31.645 --> 19:33.508
So I could stack them up right now.

19:33.568 --> 19:36.072
You were almost grumpy about it.

19:36.393 --> 19:36.913
Yeah.

19:38.375 --> 19:42.702
It forced me to do it, because I was teaching them, and it forced me to start translating.

19:42.742 --> 19:49.452
Because I was doing it, not because I'm a good translator, or that I could be better than they,

19:49.752 --> 19:59.981
I wanted really to bring out more of the philosophical elements that I was teaching in the translation.

20:01.842 --> 20:02.383
But it did.

20:02.403 --> 20:06.807
It did drive me to try, you know.

20:08.208 --> 20:14.633
And I also learned, of course, how difficult it is in a very practical way.

20:14.934 --> 20:18.797
I try this, but I'm trying to work on it a little now.

20:19.570 --> 20:23.194
I have a passion in the German canon.

20:24.976 --> 20:26.097
Very difficult.

20:28.579 --> 20:36.868
But I learn about, even though my translations are drizzly, I've read the poem when I get through.

20:37.769 --> 20:39.551
I have some sense of what's going on.

20:39.651 --> 20:47.299
I've gone through Elman's, if you mentioned Ulysses Joyce, he actually taught himself Norwegian, you know.

20:48.055 --> 20:51.759
So he could read, uh, I know people.

20:51.899 --> 20:56.984
I mean, it just drives me crazy because I'm such a bad linguist.

20:57.004 --> 20:59.547
I have two friends.

20:59.687 --> 21:01.229
One is a composer.

21:02.630 --> 21:05.794
And every time he goes someplace, he's gay.

21:06.134 --> 21:10.699
And he's always looking for good beaches with young men on them.

21:10.719 --> 21:13.962
So he says, I'm going to go to Brazil.

21:14.178 --> 21:14.979
Okay.

21:14.999 --> 21:24.494
Popped in a Portuguese tapes in his car, and pretty soon he had picked up this thing by, with his ear, you know.

21:24.514 --> 21:28.460
And he knows, I don't know how many languages that he had gotten.

21:30.103 --> 21:36.473
I don't know how much he can read, but he can converse, at least enough to pick up young boys.

21:37.972 --> 21:39.273
There you go.

21:39.533 --> 21:41.615
Twenty languages.

21:41.635 --> 21:47.460
But the other is a friend of mine who is, um, is, was a James scholar.

21:48.281 --> 21:49.922
Oh, yes, I forgot one.

21:49.942 --> 21:50.703
Oh, that's all right.

21:50.723 --> 21:51.103
Go ahead.

21:51.424 --> 21:51.884
I'm fine.

21:53.405 --> 22:02.854
Uh, and this, uh, she, um, gets in for students' fable, so she learns the Italian.

22:03.955 --> 22:07.978
Uh, and she got interested in Kierkegaard, so she learned Ganesh.

22:08.617 --> 22:16.125
And now she's just finished a big novel that she's trying to get published, a translation from the Danish.

22:17.606 --> 22:22.792
But she just, you know, it's amazing how, for me, impossible.

22:24.093 --> 22:34.824
So tell me a little bit about, you said you were in the Navy, and did you have a sense of the arc of what your life was going to... No, I knew what I wanted to do.

22:35.565 --> 22:37.847
I mean...

22:38.131 --> 22:45.300
I knew I wanted to write, and I knew that what I wanted to write would not support me.

22:46.141 --> 22:51.127
I knew also I didn't want to be in an English department at any cost.

22:51.768 --> 22:55.292
I generally don't get along with English departments.

22:56.654 --> 23:00.919
And I love philosophy, so I did want to go into philosophy.

23:00.939 --> 23:01.901
And that's about it.

23:01.941 --> 23:03.042
I mean, I didn't have any.

23:04.023 --> 23:05.505
And this is at about the age of what?

23:06.211 --> 23:10.537
Well, that decision was made when I was in high school.

23:10.557 --> 23:12.060
I was sixteen or seventeen.

23:14.103 --> 23:16.747
I had one advantage over some people.

23:17.588 --> 23:28.464
I had a clear sense, because it was obvious, but I had a clear sense of what I wanted to do very early on.

23:30.367 --> 23:35.695
I remember Mary, my wife who was an architect, she bounced from here to there and

23:36.097 --> 23:37.719
She has very many skills.

23:38.319 --> 23:42.864
When you only have one, it makes it easy.

23:44.065 --> 23:46.408
And I, so I knew that.

23:48.190 --> 23:56.519
The Navy was just a huge lengthy interruption in education.

23:57.279 --> 24:02.505
And I got into the academy where I wanted to be, and I've been there ever since.

24:03.446 --> 24:04.467
And of course it's

24:04.835 --> 24:09.301
It's an incredibly annoying place, but it's better than anywhere else I can imagine.

24:09.341 --> 24:11.143
And it's a day job, as they say.

24:11.164 --> 24:11.584
Oh, yeah.

24:12.165 --> 24:14.047
I haven't had that luxury, in fact.

24:14.328 --> 24:22.038
I have just been invited by the Yale University Press to write a centennial history of the press.

24:22.499 --> 24:22.639
Oh.

24:23.059 --> 24:26.064
And I've never written for University Press before, to me.

24:26.584 --> 24:28.707
And I'm going to meet with them next week, in fact.

24:29.068 --> 24:30.910
Well, if you're there.

24:31.295 --> 24:38.468
And you happen to run into a young woman named Michelle Comey, K-O-M-I-E.

24:38.488 --> 24:39.891
She's a wonderful young woman.

24:40.372 --> 24:45.781
She's one of the editors there now, and she worked at the International Writers' Center here.

24:47.845 --> 24:54.838
She was on my staff for a couple years before she went off to Yale.

24:55.865 --> 24:58.988
Introduce yourself, and she's terrific.

24:59.008 --> 24:59.329
Young.

24:59.769 --> 25:02.692
I think I'm going to do it.

25:02.712 --> 25:03.553
Why not?

25:03.653 --> 25:03.954
Sure.

25:03.974 --> 25:05.275
This is so alien to me.

25:05.315 --> 25:08.438
The copy deadline is the end of next year.

25:08.979 --> 25:10.180
I said, so when's the pub date?

25:10.200 --> 25:10.981
They said, 2008.

25:11.001 --> 25:11.982
I said, two years?

25:12.743 --> 25:12.923
Yeah.

25:12.943 --> 25:16.847
I mean, you ought to have longer than the pub.

25:16.867 --> 25:17.828
It takes to print it.

25:17.888 --> 25:19.170
I mean, yeah, really.

25:19.210 --> 25:22.193
But I guess that's the way it works.

25:22.375 --> 25:24.277
academic publishing.

25:24.297 --> 25:29.662
I mean, I just turned in a manuscript for my new book a couple weeks ago, and it'll be out in December, you know.

25:29.682 --> 25:35.127
Yeah, well, I just finished one and went to Knopf, and it'll be out in spring, early spring.

25:35.167 --> 25:35.648
Right now?

25:35.888 --> 25:36.168
Yeah.

25:36.188 --> 25:36.769
Oh, wonderful.

25:37.209 --> 25:37.830
What's the title?

25:38.090 --> 25:39.151
Temple of Texts.

25:39.351 --> 25:41.433
Oh, fantastic.

25:41.453 --> 25:46.658
So, I mean, I just, it moved along.

25:46.938 --> 25:47.599
Yeah.

25:47.619 --> 25:51.943
Whereas, in an academic thing, everything takes forever.

25:52.818 --> 25:56.584
Uh, and that's because there's no, no.

25:56.784 --> 26:06.158
I mean, they assume the book is, you know, eternally irrelevant, you know, and it doesn't matter.

26:06.178 --> 26:09.343
And they really need to assure themselves that you've had it right, I guess.

26:09.563 --> 26:10.084
Oh, yeah.

26:10.317 --> 26:18.184
And it's anonymous, so you don't know who's nitpicking.

26:18.204 --> 26:20.126
But they know you, and that's the trouble.

26:20.146 --> 26:21.647
Oh yeah, and if they like you, it's one thing.

26:21.687 --> 26:23.749
If they don't, I've always resisted it.

26:23.789 --> 26:35.360
My wife loves Yale University Press and likes Yale, and it's not a lot of money, but it will serve me well between this book and the next one I want to write, waiting to see how the new one does.

26:35.480 --> 26:37.422
It's like baseball.

26:37.790 --> 26:39.291
What kind of a year did you have last year?

26:39.312 --> 26:40.493
Yeah, that's right, yeah.

26:40.613 --> 26:43.936
I have a lot of confidence in this book that's coming out this fall.

26:44.296 --> 26:46.679
I might—I'm going to shut this off a second.

26:46.699 --> 26:56.228
I don't have to trans— Invitations to conferences that were largely translation problems and stuff.

26:56.248 --> 27:05.097
So I got to meet a number of translators to whom I am totally indebted, and that was fun.

27:06.022 --> 27:07.985
And I really enjoyed those conferences.

27:08.065 --> 27:10.168
I usually don't like these things.

27:11.190 --> 27:13.654
And it was, and I met him.

27:15.397 --> 27:20.164
I've met now a great many of the translators I adore.

27:20.204 --> 27:23.730
So I'm thinking this little conversation might work in there.

27:23.850 --> 27:26.694
And I've got a wonderful editor at Harper's who will allow me to do this.

27:26.855 --> 27:27.075
Oh.

27:27.636 --> 27:29.719
He'll let me do stuff with the manuscript.

27:29.739 --> 27:31.542
I can't really do it when the galleys come back.

27:31.602 --> 27:33.104
You know, I'm not tinkering.

27:33.385 --> 27:33.665
No.

27:33.685 --> 27:34.206
Things like that.

27:34.827 --> 27:41.675
I've already told them I'll be giving them 2,000 more awards, so what's the difference between 2,000 and 3,000, right?

27:41.976 --> 27:42.596
Yeah, right.

27:43.618 --> 27:47.462
That's what I think.

27:48.043 --> 27:49.185
We'll see what happens.

27:49.205 --> 27:59.417
But if you think about this whole idea, if we could just kind of enter a little bit of conversation on so much of what we get of the Western canon or the great books,

27:59.752 --> 28:03.097
It comes by way of someone else's translation, someone else's taste.

28:03.117 --> 28:03.678
Oh, yeah, yeah.

28:03.818 --> 28:07.723
And you discuss that to some extent in that book.

28:07.744 --> 28:07.944
Yeah.

28:08.384 --> 28:16.516
Well, again, of course, one is aware, especially if you try to translate anything yourself, of how much is lost.

28:16.636 --> 28:19.520
I mean, that's—and it's famous, and everybody knows about it.

28:21.023 --> 28:26.130
But, good heavens,

28:26.735 --> 28:38.006
There are people who, and I think Pound was one, whose best work depends on bouncing off another text.

28:38.327 --> 28:38.667
Really?

28:40.109 --> 28:44.933
And I think it shows up in his response.

28:44.953 --> 28:54.463
He does then translate things that are very often not literal in any sense.

28:55.085 --> 29:00.411
But that is his real source of inspiration for his own work.

29:01.031 --> 29:14.105
And a lot of the translators, some of them are classics of the early Rabelais translator and people like that.

29:14.365 --> 29:19.130
Or somebody like Thomas Hobbes' translation of Thucydides.

29:19.150 --> 29:23.995
Now Thucydides is suddenly a renaissance

29:24.295 --> 29:25.636
Yeah, but he had an agenda.

29:25.656 --> 29:26.537
Forbes had an agenda.

29:26.557 --> 29:26.978
Oh, sure.

29:27.018 --> 29:27.898
Well, they all do.

29:28.379 --> 29:31.201
Especially an agenda.

29:31.442 --> 29:33.624
But the language is amazing.

29:34.785 --> 29:38.949
Now, it isn't facilities anymore, but it is a fascinating thing.

29:39.369 --> 29:47.637
But there are other people, like William Weaver's translations, for instance, of Calvino.

29:48.418 --> 29:49.699
Those are gorgeous.

29:49.939 --> 29:51.000
Weaver's fabulous.

29:51.020 --> 29:53.222
He's just terrific, or robust.

29:53.759 --> 30:03.533
Um, and one of my favorite Latin American writers, I can't read Spanish, and I couldn't read this difficult stuff anyhow, I did know some.

30:04.515 --> 30:09.843
Um, uh, Jose Lima is, is incredibly complicated.

30:09.863 --> 30:20.659
Uh, and he did Lima's novel so beautifully in the sense of how it reads in English.

30:20.679 --> 30:21.420
Now, maybe

30:22.598 --> 30:26.663
It's not Lima's book anymore, but who cares?

30:26.683 --> 30:29.206
It's a great book in English.

30:29.786 --> 30:36.134
I'd just like you to follow up on a phrase you use, pound, his best stuff is bouncing off texts.

30:36.534 --> 30:37.275
What do you mean by that?

30:37.556 --> 30:51.492
Well, I think he looks at the texts and he's reading the courtier poets, I mean the troubadour poets, and

30:52.248 --> 31:21.630
he's or he's moving off of some early thing which the earlier the better or the the the language even further away uh and the ideas uh spark his real poetic gifts and then he starts to write the poem that that he he is is encouraged to write by this thing in the other i felt that tug myself um

31:22.859 --> 31:34.297
The best translations I've done of Rilke poems were done for my novel, where I had a different problem.

31:34.897 --> 31:45.253
Namely, I had to translate a couple of, about four, of Rilke's poems as my narrator would have translated them.

31:45.313 --> 31:46.836
Wonderful, yeah.

31:46.856 --> 31:50.301
So, I felt freer.

31:50.973 --> 32:20.642
suddenly instead of trying to be so faithful to the poem I could just sort of screw around and I think I did a better job and and I can understand that feeling and some of the most famous passages in the cantos or our translations the seafarer stuff is this marvelous

32:21.567 --> 32:31.859
And he was a person like this, of course, who was constantly digging into books and getting his ideas and phrasing.

32:32.940 --> 32:50.781
And I can carry, I know I can carry a phrase of, say, Ben Johnson's around for five years, waiting for something in my own work to try to capture what he did when he

32:50.980 --> 32:55.447
moves from one idea to another is, oh, so wonderful.

32:56.188 --> 32:59.473
And, you know, you're just wasting, waiting, waiting, waiting.

32:59.533 --> 33:02.959
You're killing me with this, because I like using epigraphs for all my chapters.

33:02.979 --> 33:03.179
Uh-huh.

33:03.880 --> 33:07.105
And it kind of makes it, I write a little bit about commonplace books.

33:07.766 --> 33:08.167
Oh, yeah.

33:08.227 --> 33:12.654
So it's kind of a little exercise in putting quotes up there, but as you say, you'll carry a quote around.

33:12.794 --> 33:13.495
I'll carry it around.

33:14.032 --> 33:27.628
I was first looking into Chapman's Homer for a decade, and then when I was writing this chapter on translation, I said, I have to use the whole sonnet, much of my travel in the realms of the world and many goodly isles and kingdoms seen.

33:27.948 --> 33:32.934
He's talking about reading a translation, Chapman's translation of Homer.

33:32.954 --> 33:33.535
That's right.

33:33.795 --> 33:37.980
Not just those two lines, use the whole sonnet.

33:38.281 --> 33:47.377
I think the only danger of these translations is that somebody may get too great a notion that they're reading the original.

33:47.578 --> 33:47.798
Yeah.

33:47.958 --> 33:50.483
Well, Brea had a very good point.

33:50.503 --> 33:56.073
He said, one of the big paradoxes is that the works themselves in the original are eternal.

33:56.093 --> 34:02.905
They're, you know, Cervantes, but it is fresh today in the original as it ever has been.

34:03.155 --> 34:07.419
And yet we need, every generation seems to need a new translation.

34:07.439 --> 34:08.120
New version.

34:08.200 --> 34:10.342
Because the translations date very quickly.

34:10.362 --> 34:11.303
That's right.

34:11.323 --> 34:12.303
Very interesting, isn't it?

34:12.624 --> 34:13.164
Yeah.

34:13.184 --> 34:32.402
Well, I think the point of Borges' wonderful piece, Pierre Menard, because that crazy idea that Pierre Menard is going to write Cervantes over

34:33.209 --> 34:53.783
himself word for word the way but cervantes did but it's going to be pierre menard's thing is simply a metaphor for each reader because each reader reads every word of the original essay in spanish for boys each word

34:54.387 --> 34:56.770
Where does Borges articulate this?

34:56.790 --> 34:59.615
This is in a collection called Fiction.

34:59.635 --> 35:00.015
I haven't had that.

35:00.035 --> 35:00.316
Okay, good.

35:00.336 --> 35:03.881
And it's called Pierre Menard, the author of Don Quixote.

35:04.702 --> 35:07.806
And it's a wonderful piece on translation and reading.

35:09.529 --> 35:22.167
Because, he says, Pierre Menard's version, which is word-for-word the same as Cervantes wrote, which, if you were reading Spanish,

35:22.838 --> 35:37.558
You would read every word Cervantes wrote, but, he says, the references to Nietzsche in Pierre Menard's version is so much profounder than in Cervantes.

35:38.640 --> 35:51.377
And, of course, the whole idea is that you bring to it all kinds of other things, and you see existentialist feelings here and back there that are

35:51.847 --> 35:54.390
I can't wait to get to this when I get home.

35:54.830 --> 35:57.032
It's a wonderful piece.

35:57.052 --> 35:59.375
He's terrific on that, I think.

36:00.336 --> 36:02.037
I love the Library of Babel, too.

36:02.638 --> 36:03.399
It's wonderful.

36:04.320 --> 36:10.566
I used an excerpt from that as the epigrack of my Patience and Fortune book.

36:11.187 --> 36:14.190
Oh, yeah.

36:14.310 --> 36:15.591
He was very funny.

36:16.532 --> 36:21.077
He came here, and I was supposed to

36:21.378 --> 36:23.841
introduce him at the chapel.

36:25.122 --> 36:28.786
And so the day before, we had lunch.

36:29.767 --> 36:36.934
And apparently he is very interested in etymology of people's names.

36:37.655 --> 36:40.798
And so he said, gas, gas, what is that?

36:41.138 --> 36:42.459
What is the meaning of that?

36:43.581 --> 36:47.925
And I said, well, it's just, it's German, it's gasa.

36:48.479 --> 36:52.527
And it's just alley, it really means alley.

36:52.547 --> 36:53.649
And he just beamed.

36:54.250 --> 37:00.541
And he said, oh, well, you know, my name comes from Burgos, city.

37:01.423 --> 37:03.246
Ah, he says, I'm a city.

37:03.286 --> 37:04.509
And you're an alley.

37:04.749 --> 37:08.596
And summed up the literary situation.

37:08.937 --> 37:11.241
That's wonderful.

37:11.281 --> 37:11.702
Yeah.

37:11.918 --> 37:30.400
I've got a nice profile of Robert Coles in my new book where he talks about, and he's the one who pioneers this whole concept of teaching medical students literature, the idea of making them better positions, but he's in his course with the Harvard students called Guilt 105, and he teaches Dorothy Day,

37:30.903 --> 37:35.430
And the Elie Wiesel book he has them read is Night, so it's Night and Day.

37:37.032 --> 37:39.336
They call that stage of the course Night and Day.

37:39.877 --> 37:40.678
It's kind of cool.

37:40.698 --> 37:41.620
Yeah, it is.

37:41.760 --> 37:42.761
He's a lot of fun.

37:43.843 --> 37:56.843
I can't wait to get this into ... There's a woman picking me up about 10.30, and if you don't mind, I always carry a camera with me, but I came here from the University of Wisconsin, and the camera

37:57.042 --> 38:00.226
is at home, and this woman who's picking me up is bringing a camera.

38:00.246 --> 38:02.689
Would you mind if I snap a couple of pictures of you?

38:02.709 --> 38:02.850
Oh, no.

38:02.870 --> 38:03.711
No problem.

38:03.731 --> 38:05.173
Because I really would like to do that.

38:05.193 --> 38:05.533
Oh, sure.

38:05.553 --> 38:07.215
We do have something for you.

38:07.235 --> 38:08.697
Oh, Mary's burning it.

38:09.538 --> 38:17.028
A CD with all of Catherine's, our daughter's stuff about books.

38:17.368 --> 38:18.630
Oh, fabulous.

38:18.730 --> 38:19.812
Maybe I can do something.

38:19.852 --> 38:22.375
Well, I don't know about that, but you might be curious.

38:22.642 --> 38:34.619
Well, I'm writing a column for this new magazine called Fine Books and Collections, and it just started, and I'm looking for fresh ideas of things to write about, and one never knows, do one.

38:34.799 --> 38:36.401
That's right.

38:36.421 --> 38:39.766
Speaking of translations, there's this new press.

38:39.806 --> 38:42.189
I don't know if you've seen Archipelago books or not.

38:42.410 --> 38:43.772
I haven't.

38:44.393 --> 38:51.503
And I've got one right here, just a new one, but they do nothing but translation.

38:52.244 --> 38:52.564
Oh, really?

38:53.152 --> 38:54.213
And they're really nice.

38:54.433 --> 38:55.815
It's a nice trap.

38:55.915 --> 38:56.775
I get it.

38:57.196 --> 39:06.165
On their boards, whatever you call it.

39:06.185 --> 39:06.825
Oh, wow.

39:07.586 --> 39:08.267
It's one of them.

39:08.607 --> 39:12.150
And I really love the way they did this.

39:12.170 --> 39:13.652
Let me just write some of this stuff down.

39:15.273 --> 39:18.236
One of the photographs that a friend of mine, he lives right across the street.

39:18.697 --> 39:20.038
He's a terrific photographer.

39:20.959 --> 39:22.180
Went to Paris.

39:22.885 --> 39:26.510
to photograph the Rodin things.

39:26.530 --> 39:31.998
And this on the wall here is one of his photographs of Rodin.

39:33.080 --> 39:36.826
In fact, I saw this Eastman.

39:36.886 --> 39:39.469
There's a lot of pictures for you, isn't it?

39:39.770 --> 39:40.010
Yes.

39:40.070 --> 39:52.048
We're doing a—with Ken Botnick, who's designing the book, we're doing a really expensive text of his stuff.

39:52.940 --> 39:53.781
I'll check these out.

39:54.441 --> 39:56.423
Where is Acapella, though?

39:56.743 --> 39:57.904
It's in New York.

39:58.044 --> 40:04.530
I don't know exactly the address, but... That's nice.

40:04.770 --> 40:06.531
Yeah, I'll contact them.

40:06.552 --> 40:12.677
This is good.

40:12.697 --> 40:12.897
Wonderful.

40:12.917 --> 40:15.759
Now, you don't have a strange spelling of Nicholas, do you?

40:16.320 --> 40:16.720
Uh, N-I-C-H.

40:16.840 --> 40:18.141
Yeah, that's right.

40:18.942 --> 40:22.525
And B-A-S-B-A-N-E-S, a Greek name.

40:23.298 --> 40:24.500
Oh.

40:24.520 --> 40:27.845
Which I'm told means winemaker, I guess, if you want to go from Alley.

40:28.166 --> 40:28.546
Really?

40:31.791 --> 40:33.394
This has been a great treat.

40:34.636 --> 40:39.163
I'm so pleased they were able to... Well, I'm glad.

40:39.223 --> 40:41.626
I was really looking forward to this.

40:42.147 --> 40:45.913
And then this thing came along, which I had to go to.

40:46.332 --> 40:48.294
Did you have a decent crowd?

40:48.335 --> 40:49.516
I had an excellent crowd.

40:50.157 --> 40:53.081
Oh, that's always nice.

40:53.321 --> 40:54.462
Just quite a few.

40:54.502 --> 40:55.744
I signed easily for an hour.

40:56.945 --> 40:58.628
Oh, well, that's great.

40:58.708 --> 41:01.391
A few people brought books, which is always nice.

41:01.431 --> 41:02.392
Yeah.

41:03.113 --> 41:06.618
Fans, you know, if you have people show up, you know.

41:06.638 --> 41:07.138
Oh, sure.

41:07.158 --> 41:10.062
I enjoyed it.

41:10.582 --> 41:18.318
Well, there was so much going on, I was a little worried, because, uh... That's why everyone was pleased with the... Yeah.

41:18.799 --> 41:28.860
It was such a pretty good... Yeah, because, um, a lot of people who would have loved to have come had to go and...

41:29.144 --> 41:36.672
What I've learned in my short life as an author is that one must leave one's ego at the door.

41:36.912 --> 41:37.813
Oh, I know.

41:37.833 --> 41:40.396
I have the same experience.

41:40.416 --> 41:43.118
Don't fret if only six people show that.

41:43.318 --> 41:45.120
And one day, they will.

41:45.801 --> 41:49.425
Do you know Tom Phillips' work?

41:50.226 --> 41:50.486
No.

41:50.526 --> 41:51.227
The Umament?

41:52.288 --> 41:52.528
No.

41:53.249 --> 41:53.949
I mean, sure.

41:54.250 --> 41:56.552
And the other one.

41:57.832 --> 41:59.654
This is... Should I follow you?

42:00.235 --> 42:00.415
Yeah.

42:00.435 --> 42:00.736
Okay.

42:02.137 --> 42:08.746
Just get my secret footer here.

42:09.086 --> 42:10.208
Lovely home, may I say.

42:10.248 --> 42:13.031
Oh, I love this.

42:13.311 --> 42:14.573
Oh, there's things here, don't we?

42:15.014 --> 42:17.196
Here's where you are.

42:17.216 --> 42:17.356
Uh-huh.

42:18.318 --> 42:18.979
Yeah.

42:18.999 --> 42:24.405
This guy took a Victorian novel called The Human Document.

42:25.547 --> 42:27.349
He's a British photographer.

42:27.599 --> 42:33.486
British artist, classicist, translator of Dante, writer of operas.

42:34.528 --> 42:48.506
And then he took this book and he started to do drawings over the top of every page, but leaving little holes for some of the words to shine through.

42:49.647 --> 42:54.433
And each of those makes a kind of haiku-ish poem or

42:55.325 --> 43:01.812
statement, and then them put together makes a kind of narrative.

43:01.832 --> 43:05.275
Uh, and he's fantastic, I think.

43:05.736 --> 43:06.617
And where's he from?

43:06.957 --> 43:10.681
He's in, he's in Cambridge, or lives in London, really.

43:11.862 --> 43:14.685
Um, and— Look at that.

43:15.026 --> 43:21.973
See, this is, of course, not an original thing, but it goes on

43:23.894 --> 43:25.556
And he's done several editions.

43:26.597 --> 43:30.763
But each page is done, is given a different treatment.

43:31.403 --> 43:32.625
That's fantastic.

43:33.666 --> 43:38.913
And when I first saw these, I saw original.

43:39.493 --> 43:47.624
I was dumbfounded, and I have one.

43:49.646 --> 43:53.631
You're blessed in that you have such a spacious home that...

43:54.067 --> 43:55.489
contain the books, you know.

43:55.769 --> 43:59.154
Yeah, well— Doesn't it mortify you, the thought of having to move?

43:59.354 --> 44:00.435
What would you do with them?

44:00.956 --> 44:03.359
Oh, we don't think of having to move.

44:03.379 --> 44:04.380
No, no moving.

44:05.882 --> 44:06.443
Eric Gill.

44:06.463 --> 44:11.069
Do you have an arrangement, or is it pretty much— You know Eric's books.

44:11.089 --> 44:14.494
And in there was the photography and books about books.

44:15.915 --> 44:22.504
There's a—in the sunroom, there's a collection of stuff on Paris, and then—

44:22.771 --> 44:24.573
all the rooms upstairs.

44:25.194 --> 44:37.426
The library, what we call the library, is all literature in English.

44:38.067 --> 44:43.473
And then my study is linguistics, rhetoric, and criticism.

44:43.933 --> 44:44.414
Wonderful.

44:44.654 --> 44:45.995
And so forth.

44:46.015 --> 44:49.639
But here it is, right here.

44:50.142 --> 44:51.724
A human document?

44:51.744 --> 44:51.884
Yeah.

44:51.904 --> 44:52.846
A human document.

44:52.866 --> 44:53.507
Isn't that wonderful?

44:53.707 --> 44:56.591
And then he calls it his version of humanment.

44:57.652 --> 45:01.177
This is a silk screen over the top.

45:04.903 --> 45:06.064
That's one of one hundred.

45:06.164 --> 45:07.446
He's an amazing man.

45:07.466 --> 45:07.967
Have you met him?

45:08.387 --> 45:08.908
Yes.

45:08.928 --> 45:10.711
We brought him at the International Life Center.

45:10.731 --> 45:11.071
Brought him.

45:12.313 --> 45:19.643
And he did a translation of Divine Comedy.

45:20.180 --> 45:24.385
The Inferno only, and did illustrations.

45:24.485 --> 45:25.627
It's wonderful too.

45:27.429 --> 45:29.572
It's amazing.

45:29.672 --> 45:31.454
So you do have a very definite scheme.

45:31.594 --> 45:32.535
You know what stuff is.

45:32.976 --> 45:33.997
Oh, I have, yeah.

45:34.017 --> 45:34.878
Otherwise I can't use it.

45:34.898 --> 45:36.140
You can lay your hands at it.

45:36.240 --> 45:37.341
I have to.

45:37.401 --> 45:40.405
You have architecture and Dura down there.

45:40.925 --> 45:46.232
Yeah, well these are in alphabetical order, only they're the large size.

45:46.773 --> 45:48.735
And this is just artists.

45:49.019 --> 45:59.094
in alphabetical order, and then over here it's history, and then we start criticism of various periods.

46:00.076 --> 46:01.738
And it keeps going along.

46:01.758 --> 46:02.880
So what do we call this room?

46:04.583 --> 46:07.567
In terms of the French room or the German room, is this the art room?

46:07.587 --> 46:09.891
Yeah, this is the art room.

46:10.472 --> 46:17.963
And then this is the multiplicative photographic, the photo collection.

46:18.112 --> 46:20.495
There are more art books coming over here.

46:21.437 --> 46:24.721
Are you constantly shifting things around?

46:24.781 --> 46:28.186
Shifting because, as you see, books start coming.

46:28.206 --> 46:30.129
I've got to reshelve everything.

46:30.549 --> 46:34.655
So then I have to find out how places to put stuff.

46:34.835 --> 46:36.478
We just got another load.

46:36.698 --> 46:37.259
There's a stack.

46:37.339 --> 46:40.183
There's other stacks that just arrived.

46:41.405 --> 46:47.393
Are you one of these people who feels that so many books, so little time, are there books that you really...

46:47.913 --> 46:53.199
feel you have to read but you haven't read yet, or is it more now picking books that you want to reread, I wonder?

46:53.219 --> 47:05.855
Oh, but I still don't get a chance to make those decisions because I'm so busy with some assignments or something, and I have to read those books because of the project.

47:06.616 --> 47:11.101
And so I rarely choose to read anything that I pick out.

47:11.401 --> 47:12.623
I can tell you one another.

47:13.564 --> 47:14.325
May I come?

47:14.345 --> 47:16.047
Sure.

47:17.697 --> 47:20.741
This is fun.

47:20.801 --> 47:21.182
Thank you.

47:21.422 --> 47:24.086
You have no idea how much of a treat and a thrill this is for me.

47:26.810 --> 47:27.470
He told me.

47:27.510 --> 47:28.472
Thank you so much.

47:28.492 --> 47:29.653
I will enjoy this.

47:30.254 --> 47:30.595
Thank you.

47:30.615 --> 47:31.876
Oh, look at this.

47:36.823 --> 47:38.405
This woman is coming out of camera, too.

47:38.445 --> 47:40.949
I'd love to take some pictures of you in one of the settings.

47:41.029 --> 47:46.877
One thing I'm proud of is the fact that I built these bookcases 35 years ago.

47:47.178 --> 47:48.960
And they're not sagging much.

47:49.641 --> 47:50.942
Well, you don't double shelve either.

47:51.463 --> 47:52.484
No.

47:52.504 --> 47:57.969
You're very lucky that you have the luxury of space where you don't have to put one row of books in front of another one.

47:58.050 --> 47:58.630
That's right.

47:59.511 --> 47:59.751
That's true.

47:59.771 --> 48:02.674
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

48:02.995 --> 48:03.435
Nine.

48:05.037 --> 48:05.537
Wow.

48:06.198 --> 48:07.900
See, what are these, about nine-foot ceilings?

48:07.920 --> 48:09.622
They must be, at least.

48:10.002 --> 48:10.363
Yeah.

48:11.784 --> 48:12.645
Fantastic.

48:13.165 --> 48:20.315
These books shouldn't be on the radiator, but I piled—I put them on top of styrofoam.

48:21.716 --> 48:30.008
So over here we have Ulysses, we have Beckett— Yeah, the Irish styrofoam is on here and goes across there and then fills that.

48:30.608 --> 48:31.790
That's Irish literature.

48:31.990 --> 48:37.738
That Brenda Maddox biography is very good.

48:38.815 --> 48:44.001
American Lit goes around to about there and then British.

48:44.021 --> 48:44.822
Including this closet.

48:44.842 --> 48:49.588
Oh, look at this, like a little, what do we call it, a pantry or an alcove, I wonder?

48:49.608 --> 48:50.690
It used to be a closet.

48:50.710 --> 48:52.572
A closet, which is great.

48:52.592 --> 48:53.533
Oh, this is great.

48:54.875 --> 48:56.597
Do you share this same madness?

48:56.997 --> 48:59.120
Yeah.

48:59.160 --> 49:01.263
She's got a great architectural library.

49:01.543 --> 49:05.768
I have a studio on the third floor, which my library is there.

49:06.068 --> 49:11.938
another bedroom on the third floor, that is for literature translation.

49:11.958 --> 49:19.129
Yeah, I always thought when my daughters moved out of the house, you know all this space all of a sudden becomes suddenly available.

49:19.310 --> 49:25.420
Oh yeah, the kid left the house and we were pouring in, I mean, with the book.

49:29.266 --> 49:31.249
Oh, this is great.

49:31.803 --> 49:39.593
I wish my wife were going to see this, that she wouldn't feel so badly about what we've done to our house.

49:39.613 --> 49:40.654
Oh, there's shelves.

49:41.055 --> 49:42.236
There's wall space here.

49:42.276 --> 49:45.240
You haven't done too broadly in here.

49:45.260 --> 49:46.041
Yeah, exactly.

49:46.101 --> 49:48.424
This is fun.

49:48.624 --> 49:51.448
So this is Elizabeth's bedroom.

49:51.468 --> 49:52.990
You have two daughters also.

49:53.030 --> 49:53.971
You have two daughters?

49:55.213 --> 49:56.234
I have two daughters.

49:56.254 --> 49:59.498
This is my sitting room now, but it's also the French library.

49:59.782 --> 50:01.704
I'm kind of messy referring to that.

50:01.724 --> 50:02.606
This is not messy.

50:03.487 --> 50:06.711
Come to my house, then you'll see messy.

50:06.731 --> 50:07.572
Stendhal.

50:07.592 --> 50:08.633
Oh, this is wonderful.

50:08.874 --> 50:09.494
Nice sitting room.

50:10.436 --> 50:18.366
I'm just so grateful to the, I don't know about yourself, that Balzac biography is fabulous, I have to say, to the publishing industry for sending me so many review books.

50:18.506 --> 50:20.288
Oh, isn't it nice.

50:20.538 --> 50:21.640
Do you like that?

50:21.680 --> 50:27.829
That really, and I'd like to acknowledge it in print, but I'm afraid that set me off.

50:27.969 --> 50:28.530
I didn't.

50:28.890 --> 50:31.274
So I'm just going to let that sleeping dog lie.

50:31.314 --> 50:36.722
That one is, but I continue to write about them, so it's... This is Camden's, I think.

50:36.742 --> 50:37.744
She had the smaller one.

50:37.784 --> 50:40.548
She was the younger, I'll bet, right?

50:41.509 --> 50:47.739
I can tell you here.

50:47.759 --> 50:50.022
This is our bedroom, which is the German furniture.

50:50.727 --> 50:56.876
Oh, this is so cool.

51:07.633 --> 51:09.055
I just got this book as well.

51:11.559 --> 51:12.641
Oh, that's Anne out there.

51:14.904 --> 51:17.528
Mary, she brought a camera for me.

51:18.301 --> 51:21.946
I want to take a few pictures, and Bill said that there.

51:21.966 --> 51:28.976
Hi, Cat.

51:28.996 --> 51:29.257
Two.

51:29.777 --> 51:30.779
Why don't you read it for me?

51:30.819 --> 51:35.145
Mrs. Orthwine, Grateful for Charming Hospitality, St.

51:35.205 --> 51:35.546
Louis.

51:37.048 --> 51:37.248
Wow.

51:37.268 --> 51:39.111
1939, Thomas Mount.

51:39.391 --> 51:40.272
That was at the sale.

51:40.873 --> 51:41.133
Yes.

51:41.975 --> 51:45.760
And two volumes of Joseph in Egypt, three dollars.

51:45.908 --> 51:48.711
Hold on to that, because I'd like to take a picture of you with it.

51:48.731 --> 51:53.196
The woman is just coming in with the camera.

51:54.458 --> 51:54.978
Wow!

51:55.179 --> 52:00.885
I was looking at this sort of idly, and then my hand began to shake.

52:01.045 --> 52:05.010
You can't see the goose.

52:05.090 --> 52:05.630
My goodness!

52:06.271 --> 52:06.812
Wow!

52:07.072 --> 52:09.655
How, how could anyone

52:10.175 --> 52:10.876
You know what happens?

52:10.976 --> 52:15.221
People pass away, and the next generation, they could care less.

52:15.641 --> 52:17.864
I mean, I got an Emily Dickinson for $10.

52:18.445 --> 52:21.528
You know, I mean, perfect first.

52:22.029 --> 52:22.449
Thank you.

52:23.210 --> 52:23.971
You know, Mr. Gass?

52:24.472 --> 52:25.233
Hello.

52:25.253 --> 52:26.815
Good to see you.

52:26.895 --> 52:31.120
All right, so now, you know how this works, right?

52:31.140 --> 52:33.002
It's joy, but I think you just put it on.

52:33.162 --> 52:34.063
I think we go on.

52:34.584 --> 52:36.486
Oh, super.

52:36.871 --> 52:38.553
I'm going to take some pictures of you, sir.

52:38.894 --> 52:39.295
Okay.

52:39.455 --> 52:41.418
How about, um... Where do you want?

52:41.818 --> 52:42.579
In the other room?

52:42.740 --> 52:44.823
That other room is fabulous, yeah.

52:47.487 --> 52:53.616
It's more like... I want one of these, uh... This has really been wonderful.

52:53.636 --> 52:56.800
Well, let's just get a couple of, like, uh... Now with the television.

52:57.522 --> 52:58.603
Oh, yeah.

52:58.623 --> 52:59.384
I know.

52:59.404 --> 52:59.805
How about that?

53:00.606 --> 53:02.168
That corner looks really good.

53:02.509 --> 53:03.250
Let me just put your tape on.

53:04.293 --> 53:07.858
I do take very few pictures.

53:07.878 --> 53:12.605
How about in the corner?

53:14.127 --> 53:15.509
Oh, this is great.

53:15.549 --> 53:33.354
Now, how about if you open to the time to the description and I'll shoot over your shoulder like this?

53:33.374 --> 53:33.574
Very good.

53:34.195 --> 53:36.157
Excellent.

53:36.177 --> 53:43.005
Do you like to take me a seated picture?

53:43.025 --> 53:43.185
No.

53:43.205 --> 53:49.972
This is really a picture of Harold Bloom in his room.

53:50.113 --> 53:51.554
Oh, I bet.

53:51.634 --> 53:57.941
It's an older picture before he lost off of weight, but he's a little older.

53:59.062 --> 54:01.485
This is very good.

54:09.076 --> 54:09.637
Okay.

54:11.680 --> 54:12.240
I've got a few.

54:12.941 --> 54:15.264
Maybe in the room downstairs, if you don't mind.

54:15.405 --> 54:15.685
Sure.

54:17.147 --> 54:22.354
And do you mind if I get in touch with you at some point, if I have any questions?

54:23.616 --> 54:25.939
Easy to reach an email.

54:31.046 --> 54:32.828
The email address?

54:33.770 --> 54:35.472
We just changed it.

54:36.430 --> 54:48.707
I have a picture of the two of you, do you mind?

54:49.889 --> 54:51.391
How about in here, where we have a little light?

54:52.733 --> 54:53.995
All of these rooms have names.

54:54.015 --> 54:56.458
There's a French room, there's an art room, there's a German room.

54:59.963 --> 55:01.946
I'm thinking.

55:02.046 --> 55:04.750
I like things like, let's try a couple

55:07.852 --> 55:08.573
I like the light.

55:08.693 --> 55:10.255
Get a little closer if you don't mind.

55:11.497 --> 55:12.458
Well, that's not going to work.

55:14.500 --> 55:15.722
Did I blast with them?

55:16.503 --> 55:20.328
Well, the service part of the books over here.

55:24.733 --> 55:26.415
But they're not better still there.

55:26.936 --> 55:31.321
And I'm going to do close up to the books.

55:31.341 --> 55:32.122
We'll sit together.

55:32.202 --> 55:32.923
Thank you.

55:32.943 --> 55:35.867
I'll take a couple of these if you don't mind.

55:36.623 --> 55:38.706
That's very nice to get back a little bit.

55:43.352 --> 55:45.615
I left my camera to look at home.

55:46.255 --> 55:48.218
Oh, that is a bad thing.

55:48.238 --> 55:50.281
Well, I didn't know what they were doing.

55:52.363 --> 56:05.500
And I came here by way of Madison, and it was one of these things where the airlines only let you take two bags on now, and my camera clip, it did a whole extra bag, and I was making connections, and I didn't want to be packing any bags.

56:05.952 --> 56:08.975
Um, it's worth telling.

56:12.539 --> 56:13.701
Ah, you know this book?

56:14.441 --> 56:16.183
Well, I don't know.

56:16.424 --> 56:18.426
They're over here.

56:20.548 --> 56:21.489
Yeah, this is famous.

56:21.509 --> 56:24.693
You're looking for this book?

56:24.713 --> 56:25.053
Yeah.

56:25.634 --> 56:26.174
Yeah, they are.

56:26.755 --> 56:27.116
Mine too.

56:27.716 --> 56:28.357
They're there.

56:28.417 --> 56:32.061
All right, here you come to mind.

56:32.429 --> 56:35.194
And it probably has toilet paper in it.

56:35.394 --> 56:37.097
It might have a page.

56:37.117 --> 56:37.858
It isn't toilet paper.

56:37.978 --> 56:38.699
It's something better.

56:39.260 --> 56:44.809
This is vanity for me, but would you mind if we have a picture of it?

56:45.050 --> 56:48.776
How about, can you get it this way with these shelves?

56:49.157 --> 56:49.617
Oh, yes.

56:50.058 --> 56:55.287
You have to have it in the picture, and that's right.

56:55.307 --> 56:55.547
Okay.

56:57.410 --> 56:59.213
This picture pretty much is in his perspective.

57:00.948 --> 57:03.311
It seems sort of real or something.

57:03.331 --> 57:04.052
This one?

57:04.072 --> 57:06.175
It looks like it's... Maybe it'll shut up.

57:06.195 --> 57:07.216
Oh, you're back.

57:07.256 --> 57:09.660
Oh, I'm looking at it.

57:09.680 --> 57:11.923
I don't do photography here anymore.

57:12.043 --> 57:13.625
Just pretty much a little bit.

57:13.645 --> 57:13.745
Okay.

57:15.668 --> 57:16.269
There you go.

57:16.289 --> 57:16.809
Take another.

57:17.230 --> 57:17.550
Okay.

57:21.335 --> 57:22.737
Thank you.

57:22.897 --> 57:23.679
Great.

57:23.699 --> 57:24.319
May I sit here?

57:24.540 --> 57:25.641
Yeah, sure.

57:26.022 --> 57:28.525
I'll put it all through.

57:29.467 --> 57:57.461
This is a lady across the street, and it's a descendant of one of the initial investors in Calview, and so it's in her family.

57:57.481 --> 57:58.883
This is Skinker Road at Del Mar.

58:01.580 --> 58:06.946
Yeah, the mule trains, horses that graded the property.

58:06.966 --> 58:09.189
It's amazing how treeless it was.

58:09.309 --> 58:10.290
Oh, yeah.

58:10.370 --> 58:18.819
I can't get over that, because we live at 6140 Westminster, and I've seen, you know, from the stinker of Oliver neighborhood shops.

58:20.101 --> 58:22.223
They just leveled it.

58:23.925 --> 58:28.710
And I just think what it was like in the summertime.

58:28.730 --> 58:30.532
Hot, nothing to shave.

58:30.713 --> 58:31.013
Yeah.

58:31.398 --> 58:33.340
Dust blowing.

58:33.380 --> 58:35.843
Was it being actively farmed at some point?

58:35.863 --> 58:36.063
Yeah.

58:36.083 --> 58:38.686
I thought it was part of a large farm farm.

58:38.706 --> 58:40.168
In the someplace area, it was a farm.

58:40.408 --> 58:41.810
Well, we were a farm, too.

58:41.850 --> 58:42.270
Yeah.

58:42.330 --> 58:43.492
Okay.

58:43.512 --> 58:49.638
And I talked with, this is looking down Union to Washington University.

58:49.658 --> 58:50.620
You can kind of see it there.

58:50.720 --> 58:52.742
The fancy road for the time.

58:52.762 --> 58:53.823
I mean, compared to the other.

58:53.843 --> 58:57.627
This is Lindell, looking from Union down Lindell.

58:58.428 --> 58:59.970
Yeah, it had just been built on.

59:00.085 --> 59:01.367
Yeah.

59:01.387 --> 59:01.788
Okay, St.

59:01.848 --> 59:02.710
Louis.

59:02.830 --> 59:24.928
Now, do you realize today is Shakespeare's birth birth birth birth birth birth birth birth birth birth birth birth birth birth birth birth birth birth birth birth birth birth birth birth birth birth birth birth birth birth birth birth birth birth birth birth birth birth birth birth birth birth birth

59:25.111 --> 59:29.276
But this earth moving, this grading, is pretty serious.

59:29.416 --> 59:33.862
I think probably this also happened in Skink and Bolivar area.

59:35.023 --> 59:37.566
I talked with Carol Diaz-Granadas.

59:37.586 --> 59:38.888
I don't know if you know her.

59:38.988 --> 59:39.208
No.

59:39.268 --> 59:49.320
She's a graduate of the anthropology department, a professional archaeologist, and she's done digs in Forest Park and along over to Perry University.

59:49.881 --> 59:52.384
And I just asked her, because I wanted to find out if

59:52.634 --> 59:58.064
In fact, we couldn't make any sort of assumptions about Native Americans.

59:58.104 --> 59:58.766
Well, thank you.

59:58.806 --> 01:00:05.638
What I'd like to do, if I may, when I get home and send you a copy of the Slender of Letters, the book, which follows... Sure, I'd love it.

01:00:05.799 --> 01:00:11.790
And just so you'll be able to see the next one, which is... If you're waiting for the book fair...

01:00:12.074 --> 01:00:16.100
And you say you usually buy about a hundred or so.

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:17.582
A hundred or more books.

01:00:17.602 --> 01:00:24.673
Now do you do this in tandem, or do you shamelessly use your wife to shuffle the stuff back and forth to the car?

01:00:25.474 --> 01:00:37.052
We take little shopping carts that fold up, and we both go in different directions at different things.

01:00:37.252 --> 01:01:02.128
and uh and and it's it's great fun because stuff that we're interested in almost no one else is there's no rush um and uh and then the books all have their own history in the feel of them even their ware and actually i've found a few things

01:01:02.328 --> 01:01:15.203
that I could save, namely a friend, a writer friend, and the first edition of one of their books of poetry, so I can pick it up.

01:01:15.744 --> 01:01:21.992
Isn't it really, have you ever found any inscribed copies of your own books being sold?

01:01:22.212 --> 01:01:22.412
No.

01:01:22.953 --> 01:01:26.897
Actually, I have rarely ever seen.

01:01:27.558 --> 01:01:30.782
It is the sort of thing where,

01:01:31.049 --> 01:01:36.820
I don't sell, but I did sell one of my books once.

01:01:37.501 --> 01:01:43.733
It was an inscribed copy by John Gardner of his first novel.

01:01:44.434 --> 01:01:51.808
And I got offered so much money for it, I thought, you know, okay.

01:01:52.261 --> 01:01:54.724
And then I saw it in the catalog.

01:01:54.744 --> 01:01:57.647
Yeah, that's depressing, isn't it?

01:01:57.667 --> 01:01:58.629
Yeah, it is.

01:01:59.049 --> 01:02:01.332
You feel betrayed, actually, don't you?

01:02:01.352 --> 01:02:01.712
Yeah.

01:02:02.133 --> 01:02:02.773
I sold a book.

01:02:03.154 --> 01:02:06.938
I wrote about the Emily Dickinson, a little collecting book.

01:02:06.958 --> 01:02:10.923
And I was offered, I paid $10 for it, and I was offered $7,000 for it.

01:02:10.943 --> 01:02:15.428
And then I had two daughters in college, and you say, well, okay, well, you know.

01:02:15.969 --> 01:02:16.750
And I don't collect them.
