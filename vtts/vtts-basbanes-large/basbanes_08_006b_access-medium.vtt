WEBVTT

00:02.545 --> 00:04.068
Here we go.

00:04.369 --> 00:10.623
Background.

00:10.643 --> 00:18.059
No, I'm, you know, it won't be a painful book since I came there, but, you know, Honolulu is actually where all the papers are, really, at various places.

00:18.079 --> 00:20.284
I mean, there's...

00:20.669 --> 00:22.731
This one was really going to round to round.

00:22.751 --> 00:35.924
You wouldn't choose Honolulu, I think.

00:35.944 --> 00:39.188
So, I mean, the question was whether or not they'd all be related.

00:39.208 --> 00:40.189
I don't know.

00:40.209 --> 00:42.231
I mean, I guess it's for others to judge.

00:42.251 --> 00:48.197
I certainly don't make an effort and say, oh, well... Well, I think you do an interest to them.

00:48.217 --> 00:48.297
Yes.

00:48.597 --> 01:01.031
That's a silly thing to say, but you're not on any mission to create the great body of work on the history of Poland.

01:02.232 --> 01:03.314
No, that's exactly right.

01:03.334 --> 01:15.347
You write a book, possibly called Soldiers, which will talk about what happened to the French Revolution when the whole country actually turns into an army.

01:15.715 --> 01:26.069
But there was such a huge list of drama there, and I thought I would do it in the Egyptian campaign, which impressed me a lot.

01:26.089 --> 01:29.153
That's something I haven't quite... The Hawaii idea sort of pushed things.

01:29.173 --> 01:35.362
They have something in common in that they're about the collision between an ancient culture and a kind of very aggressive, well-organized, specifically a modern culture.

01:35.382 --> 01:41.070
The mass story of the ancient culture isn't quite complete or part of my experience.

01:41.090 --> 01:41.691
That's a trivial question.

01:41.711 --> 01:44.895
It is Hawaii the only state that had it, that there was a kingdom to find.

01:44.875 --> 01:52.607
Yes, it certainly is.

01:52.627 --> 02:00.679
It's also the only state that has this British national flag in its state flag.

02:00.699 --> 02:03.884
That I didn't know.

02:03.904 --> 02:08.972
Oh yes, the Union Jack is in the Hawaii state flag.

02:09.172 --> 02:11.035
It's in the Hawaii state flag.

02:11.470 --> 02:19.357
long, you know, roll of the sandwich items, as a British protector.

02:19.377 --> 02:21.820
There's a more new biography on it.

02:21.840 --> 02:21.980
I know.

02:22.000 --> 02:22.881
Oh, I got it wrong.

02:22.901 --> 02:24.262
Oh, is that right?

02:24.282 --> 02:24.883
Norton.

02:24.983 --> 02:25.683
Norton's on it.

02:25.823 --> 02:27.445
Do you remember the author?

02:27.565 --> 02:29.367
I'll send it to you.

02:29.387 --> 02:29.887
That's good.

02:29.907 --> 02:31.088
There's time there.

02:31.108 --> 02:31.569
Oh, thank you.

02:31.589 --> 02:37.474
I'll give you a address, and I'd love to put you on the list to receive a copy of my book, if you'd like to.

02:37.494 --> 02:38.475
Oh, thank you.

02:38.495 --> 02:39.156
Yes, I'd love to.

02:39.176 --> 02:40.397
I'll give you, I'll tell you what, because I'm,

02:41.052 --> 02:43.215
And they're not going to be in Columbia anymore.

02:43.235 --> 02:45.478
So let me give them my home address, which is 421.

02:46.740 --> 02:48.543
Hardscrabble Road.

02:49.103 --> 02:50.846
Good job.

02:50.866 --> 02:52.528
Hardscrabble Road.

02:52.588 --> 02:53.430
Have you?

02:53.870 --> 02:54.231
Yeah.

02:54.271 --> 02:55.412
Well, there are two.

02:55.432 --> 02:59.558
I think the one you'll see on this chronic is different.

02:59.578 --> 03:02.723
There are two Hardscrabble Road.

03:02.843 --> 03:06.969
This is in Briarcliff Manor.

03:06.989 --> 03:08.351
B-R-I-A-R.

03:08.371 --> 03:09.152
Briarcliff.

03:09.132 --> 03:14.021
Manor, which sounds much more exciting.

03:14.261 --> 03:17.267
And the zip is New York 10510.

03:18.849 --> 03:20.132
Philip and Blake.

03:20.152 --> 03:21.374
No, I'd love to see it.

03:21.715 --> 03:22.576
It's great.

03:22.596 --> 03:23.458
It's exciting.

03:23.558 --> 03:25.742
It's really good.

03:26.303 --> 03:27.204
Yeah, it's wonderful.

03:27.264 --> 03:28.747
We've seen the jacket.

03:28.887 --> 03:30.210
I have the book.

03:30.290 --> 03:31.512
Yeah, that's great.

03:31.492 --> 03:32.413
I'm sorry?

03:32.433 --> 03:39.219
No, you said something about... I interviewed Tactical Brian.

03:39.319 --> 03:41.340
Oh, yeah.

03:41.441 --> 03:42.421
Oh, delightful.

03:42.501 --> 03:42.682
Good.

03:42.702 --> 03:47.186
And he's published by Norton as well, and he had just received a book.

03:47.226 --> 03:47.746
Oh, nice.

03:47.766 --> 03:48.166
Good.

03:48.186 --> 03:50.648
He did a biography of Joseph Banks.

03:50.869 --> 03:51.950
Of course, he did.

03:53.691 --> 03:54.412
I love that.

03:54.432 --> 03:57.895
You know which other terrific historical novel, Joseph Banks, appears in?

03:57.915 --> 04:00.537
Actually, everything is different from O'Brien's.

04:00.517 --> 04:04.564
Um, Karegs and Ed Boyle's first book.

04:04.584 --> 04:06.067
Oh, he has a vocal water music.

04:06.828 --> 04:09.353
May not be his first book.

04:09.533 --> 04:13.780
Roughly because he's the second there.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.043
You're right.

04:15.063 --> 04:16.084
You're right.

04:16.305 --> 04:17.126
You're right.

04:17.166 --> 04:21.193
It was an early book, though, yes.

04:21.214 --> 04:21.594
And I gave it away.

04:21.614 --> 04:22.215
And now it's selling for $300.

04:22.235 --> 04:22.836
That'll work.

04:22.856 --> 04:23.217
Thank you.

04:23.197 --> 04:28.182
World's End is one of my absolutely favorite books.

04:28.202 --> 04:29.904
I had to meet him a couple years ago.

04:29.924 --> 04:36.431
He's said to be reclusive and difficult, actually.

04:36.471 --> 04:36.572
No.

04:36.632 --> 04:37.853
He's very interesting.

04:37.873 --> 04:42.258
He actually wanted his editor in his last book to be the publicity director.

04:42.858 --> 04:47.203
And then really wants to tie in what was that?

04:47.223 --> 04:47.383
Right.

04:47.463 --> 04:48.825
He had such a nice job.

04:49.085 --> 04:50.246
He had such a nice thing.

04:50.266 --> 04:51.528
Right.

04:51.548 --> 04:51.668
Right.

04:52.137 --> 04:57.986
I, myself, teach them, I value it.

04:58.126 --> 05:09.605
I don't know, which parts of the audience can be brought, as opposed to how we're going to mark up the book.

05:09.765 --> 05:11.608
But I've really got a ton of stuff.

05:11.628 --> 05:13.811
Is there anything you think I've missed?

05:13.951 --> 05:18.178
I love it when you say you expect these pages begging to differ.

05:18.428 --> 05:33.687
So I suppose that in order to understand humanity's relationship with nature, you have to repudiate history.

05:33.667 --> 05:42.846
that history was a kind of record of the dominion, that humanity's indifference and imperviousness to nature.

05:43.146 --> 05:44.970
And that's the choice you had.

05:45.090 --> 05:47.675
You basically had a choice of nature or history.

05:47.796 --> 05:51.523
So that's the view with which I wanted to say that actually

05:51.503 --> 05:57.851
History and nature are mutually exclusive, like jobs and stuff.

05:57.932 --> 06:05.321
They actually, everywhere we can think of, imagine, live in, they're actually wrapped up in each other.

06:05.962 --> 06:15.655
It's possible to imagine a history in which nature really in some ways, I would say sort of calls the shots completely, but in which

06:15.635 --> 06:25.640
Issues of politics, national identity, personal and religious salvation are all done through nature.

06:25.660 --> 06:30.673
Nature gives the kind of vocabulary in which these things are explained and expressed.

06:30.653 --> 06:41.231
So that was really... I thought you were referring to the slightly self-consciously Dickensian tone.

06:41.391 --> 06:43.435
I liked it.

06:43.575 --> 06:51.008
I mean I also liked it in the beginning was the title of the Prologs of Dupor.

06:50.988 --> 06:59.761
It does give a sense of the serendipitous nature of what's happening.

07:00.342 --> 07:04.228
That's precisely what I had in my head.

07:04.308 --> 07:06.672
That is precisely it.

07:07.152 --> 07:12.861
I had a really question to you about the book, because that's fine.

07:12.841 --> 07:30.398
Richard Bellstein's review was a timeless reviewer.

07:30.418 --> 07:32.402
It was nice of him to quote me so extensively at the end, but he said,

07:32.905 --> 07:40.638
I'm not sure at all what someone meant by the details he meant by that, actually, but it was... A, so it's going to be entirely... So, how are we doing?

07:40.658 --> 07:43.643
We'll be at least in a bit, so... Ten minutes?

07:43.663 --> 07:45.947
Is that anything?

07:46.147 --> 07:46.948
Yeah, fine.

07:46.968 --> 07:50.234
Could he have something coming up?

07:50.795 --> 07:51.336
Yeah, two o'clock.

07:51.876 --> 07:52.838
The other was...

07:54.134 --> 08:11.180
The way in which, exactly like the hill of Krakow, or the Jewish cemetery of Puntz, the place of humanly designed memory became turned into landscape and nature.

08:11.280 --> 08:16.628
I mean, that was the nature of the same dividend.

08:16.648 --> 08:18.371
I think I'm going to do a story here.

08:18.391 --> 08:20.013
I'm putting it at the top of my list.

08:20.334 --> 08:20.614
Oh, thank you.

08:20.594 --> 08:28.258
I did five interviews.
