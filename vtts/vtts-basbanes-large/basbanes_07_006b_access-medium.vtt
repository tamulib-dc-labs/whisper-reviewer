WEBVTT

00:03.220 --> 00:06.584
Whatever you say.

00:07.145 --> 00:12.932
So they interviewed me and they asked me, they asked some other guy in the interview, did he read his books?

00:13.052 --> 00:13.994
He read every one of them.

00:14.594 --> 00:16.036
They asked me, did I read my books?

00:16.116 --> 00:16.797
I said, come on.

00:16.837 --> 00:20.922
I said, I got a huge collection of the Mather, Cotton Mather and Increase Mather in their sermons.

00:20.983 --> 00:23.285
I said, I defy any rhythm to read that garbage.

00:29.834 --> 00:32.417
I have to tell you, I received several phone calls.

00:32.836 --> 00:40.366
from people telling me that I blasphemed the name of the Lord, and what kind of person was I, and I would rot in hell for the rest of my life.

00:41.347 --> 00:46.274
And, you know, you don't make statements like that in public magazines.

00:48.677 --> 00:51.201
But you asked me the question, am I a scholar?

00:51.221 --> 01:01.054
Steve Riley, Steve Riley at the Restorical Society walking me through, he said, there is a great unpublished manuscript by Cotton Mehta, Biblioteca Americana.

01:01.642 --> 01:02.944
There it sits.

01:04.286 --> 01:09.913
He said, it awaits publication, because he said, and he's been there for 50 years.

01:09.953 --> 01:15.781
He said, I've seen them come and spend two days on it, and they're gone.

01:15.801 --> 01:18.425
He said, it's impenetrable.

01:18.445 --> 01:21.168
And it's exactly what you said, you know.

01:22.771 --> 01:25.454
By style, content, and design.

01:25.695 --> 01:26.416
By everything.

01:26.796 --> 01:30.501
Every imagined, but there is no addition critical or analyzed,

01:33.130 --> 02:02.175
But my point is that from a rag picker's mentality,

02:02.662 --> 02:03.162
From what?

02:03.323 --> 02:04.764
Rag pickers mentality.

02:05.064 --> 02:06.005
I acquire anything.

02:06.145 --> 02:08.707
I do it without discrimination.

02:08.987 --> 02:09.988
And that's the whole idea.

02:10.289 --> 02:31.707
What happened was, at one point I decided that the interaction, there is a link with some mechanism of history by experiencing holding, or not holding so much,

02:31.923 --> 02:39.694
just possessing for a period of time or having these early imprints, they strike a responsive chord.

02:39.975 --> 02:40.375
For you?

02:40.556 --> 02:40.856
For me.

02:41.878 --> 03:00.325
Probably the most telling example I can give you and one of the most meaningful books I've ever read is a book called The Last Men of the Revolution, which is imperfect at best, but it's a book that was published about 1865.

03:00.726 --> 03:01.727
Some guy went around.

03:02.686 --> 03:10.057
and found out there were seven guys living who had fought in 1865, who had fought in the revolution.

03:10.077 --> 03:31.950
And he visited them all, took that picture, took that picture, and there was the photograph, they printed them up, and each photograph was in the book, and it was a narrative of his... And I have copies, which I got two copies, they're two different issues of the book, but I have two copies which I have preserved and will give my kids.

03:32.251 --> 03:37.919
And in reading that book, the idea of seeing the picture of these guys had a very striking effect on me.

03:38.520 --> 03:43.327
So that to some degree, I would say that if I really were to examine it, why am I collecting these?

03:43.788 --> 03:44.889
How did you find this book?

03:44.909 --> 03:45.751
How did you learn about it?

03:45.771 --> 03:46.832
Oh, no, it's kind of important.

03:46.852 --> 03:47.834
Did you just ran into it?

03:47.854 --> 03:48.214
You ran into it.

03:48.294 --> 03:51.098
I mean, it's, you know, life experience.

03:51.118 --> 03:52.581
Probably you would cost a lot of money.

03:52.601 --> 03:52.961
Oh, no, no.

03:53.141 --> 03:54.644
It's a known book, and it's quite expensive.

03:54.684 --> 03:57.928
Probably today it's about, I would say, $700, $800.

03:58.129 --> 03:59.010
It's not a cheap book.

03:59.350 --> 04:01.093
It's important for its photographic.

04:02.018 --> 04:02.539
1860?

04:02.559 --> 04:03.860
1860, yeah.

04:03.940 --> 04:06.583
But anyway, but I got those books.

04:06.884 --> 04:09.086
And I got a couple of the books that I got from my kids.

04:09.106 --> 04:12.510
Robert Lipsight's Put Me in the Zoo, and I remember called Old Rock.

04:12.530 --> 04:14.733
Why do you hold that for the kids as opposed to, how?

04:15.013 --> 04:15.634
I told each.

04:15.854 --> 04:17.476
I want my children to have certain books.

04:17.496 --> 04:18.897
Yeah, but can we go through the numbers?

04:18.917 --> 04:27.747
Can you give me an itemized itemization?

04:27.828 --> 04:29.630
Give me some numbers of what you have.

04:30.290 --> 04:31.772
Oh, well, okay.

04:32.090 --> 04:38.838
Let me get back to the idea, because you're going to have to follow this through, on collecting another of the ideas of numbers.

04:40.180 --> 04:56.841
When I got in, because this is more important than numbers, when I decided, or whatever it was, to try to accumulate these early imprints, I was very fortunate in that no one else had done it for 50 years.

04:56.901 --> 05:01.827
And those people who bought 17th century American imprints

05:02.127 --> 05:12.137
bought the book, bought those books that they bought either for historical content, whether it was a law book or an important book or a sermon, but it was generally a bijou item.

05:13.318 --> 05:20.345
The imperfect copies, the things in rags, the things in tattered bindings and what have you, were out of commerce.

05:20.365 --> 05:21.306
They were in drawers.

05:21.326 --> 05:30.936
The booksellers like Goodspeed or Robinson or Papantonio or all these other great dealers who had accumulated this stuff over a lifetime of dealing

05:31.422 --> 05:38.390
found that it was not merchantable but would never throw it away, when they died or got rid of it, there were still these corpuses that were left.

05:39.512 --> 05:40.833
C-O-R-P-U-S-E-S.

05:41.214 --> 05:41.474
Yes.

05:42.435 --> 05:47.942
Anyway, I walked in and I skimmed everything that was around.

05:47.962 --> 05:49.764
I bought everything I could get my hands on.

05:51.186 --> 05:57.133
And I simply was fortunate as having the... I was the right guy at the right time.

05:57.613 --> 05:58.054
I bought it.

05:58.094 --> 06:01.378
I bought it indiscriminately and wound up having

06:02.152 --> 06:04.575
a very, very great holding of this.

06:04.895 --> 06:06.156
There's no private holding there.

06:06.377 --> 06:09.200
This holding could not be duplicated today.

06:09.220 --> 06:19.571
The only way it could be would be in some catastrophic economic event where great libraries holding this material simply disgorge them.

06:19.591 --> 06:23.675
I mean, and I don't... So what happens to this collection?

06:24.816 --> 06:28.260
It gets added to hopefully for another 20 or 30 years.

06:30.215 --> 06:32.297
and then gets dispersed.

06:32.818 --> 06:35.661
But the value... Wait a minute.

06:35.681 --> 06:37.543
Don't go buy it with one verb.

06:37.563 --> 06:39.325
I mean, we need dispersed.

06:39.665 --> 06:46.693
The likelihood is, no one needs... If it's such an extraordinary collection... No one needs... Shouldn't it be retained?

06:47.313 --> 06:51.578
No one needs a third tip.

06:51.598 --> 06:57.124
Everything that I have, if my collection is... I didn't say my collection is extraordinary.

06:57.224 --> 06:58.045
I said simply,

06:58.328 --> 07:00.811
It's the best collection that's been formed in 100 years.

07:01.892 --> 07:23.839
But if you want to put it in a perspective, even having collected, and even assuming another 20 years of collecting, in the area of what I have, it probably would rank somewhere between, I would say, there will be always five collections better than mine.

07:24.400 --> 07:25.081
Institutional.

07:25.261 --> 07:25.922
Institutional.

07:27.269 --> 07:29.011
Nice to meet you.

07:29.031 --> 07:29.291
Thanks a lot.

07:29.311 --> 07:29.952
See you later.

07:29.972 --> 07:30.272
Okay.

07:30.372 --> 07:31.573
There will always be five better.

07:32.214 --> 07:40.543
Now, I don't know, and I certainly don't think the world needs a six, or something plugged in between five and ten.

07:40.883 --> 07:42.665
If it were unique, then that's enough.

07:42.685 --> 07:43.586
It's not unique.

07:43.606 --> 07:45.107
There are many unique things in it.

07:45.268 --> 07:47.890
In other words, I probably... Well, how about the unique things then?

07:48.191 --> 07:49.832
But how about them?

07:49.872 --> 07:54.357
Let's say in another five years or another ten years,

07:54.877 --> 08:05.311
I have somewhat in excess of 5,000 Evans items, 5,000 American ink prints printed before 1800, and I have probably 150 printed before 1700.

08:06.272 --> 08:23.776
And those numbers today probably put me in, let's say, the top 10 of holdings that would include Antiquarium, Harvard, Mass Historical, Boston Public, Library of Congress.

08:23.796 --> 08:24.377
I probably have more.

08:24.678 --> 08:32.368
Library of Congress, Library of Philadelphia, whatever it may be, Huntington.

08:33.149 --> 08:37.535
But my collection starts to approximate those holdings.

08:37.976 --> 08:48.650
Secondly, if you look at those institutional holdings, a very interesting thing is that when it becomes institutionalized, it becomes sacred and purified.

08:49.230 --> 08:53.436
Everything the institution has is perfect, or is perceived to be

08:53.956 --> 09:23.406
without fault when you go into the stacks no i'm not saying that those that know know differently but when you go into the stacks and you take a look at what in fact the object is as opposed to what the object is perceived the book that is cataloged as x turns out to be x but lacking the first four and last 30 pages torn bound and whatever the hell it may be and from an institutional perspective my collection as to quality and i say this only because

09:24.145 --> 09:28.834
The odor of how I buy is I buy all the shit.

09:29.254 --> 09:30.016
I don't buy all the shit.

09:30.036 --> 09:32.981
I buy everything, but there's good stuff and bad stuff.

09:33.001 --> 09:34.123
So you cull?

09:34.965 --> 09:42.559
Whether I cull or I don't cull, certainly I cull, and certainly I look to enhance and make better what I do.

09:43.180 --> 09:48.387
If I clean my collection up, which I'm in the process of doing, and I wind up with 5,000... What does that mean?

09:48.407 --> 09:48.767
Weeding?

09:48.987 --> 09:49.328
Weeding.

09:49.528 --> 09:51.991
I take some, multiple copies I don't want.

09:52.071 --> 09:53.013
Many things I'll keep.

09:53.814 --> 09:57.238
I have, for example, there's a book, Commodographia, by Cotton Matter.

09:58.139 --> 09:58.720
Increased Matter.

09:59.741 --> 10:04.347
Which is a great scientific treatise of the 17th century in America.

10:05.329 --> 10:06.210
I have 20 copies.

10:07.311 --> 10:07.812
I'm sorry, what?

10:07.932 --> 10:10.195
I have 20 copies of that book, printed in 1683.

10:10.375 --> 10:11.056
You have 20?

10:11.076 --> 10:11.557
20.

10:11.897 --> 10:12.698
Why do you have 20?

10:12.914 --> 10:13.334
Why not?

10:14.656 --> 10:16.157
Brindley had nine Elliott Bogles.

10:16.918 --> 10:18.079
I only had three.

10:18.679 --> 10:20.901
That violates every rule of collecting.

10:20.921 --> 10:21.422
No, it doesn't.

10:22.203 --> 10:22.663
Exactly.

10:22.683 --> 10:23.804
That's the whole point.

10:25.726 --> 10:28.268
You're being, what some people would say, a pig.

10:28.428 --> 10:28.688
No.

10:29.389 --> 10:34.754
I'm collecting only because that... You're denying 19 people a copy of that book.

10:34.774 --> 10:38.558
No, because I don't have... Of the 19 copies I have... 20.

10:38.778 --> 10:42.381
Of the 20 copies that I have, let's say a couple of them are complete.

10:43.036 --> 10:44.418
Some are missing one or two pages.

10:44.438 --> 10:46.541
Well, if you're talking variants, that's another story.

10:46.601 --> 10:57.797
There are many variants in it, but unless you can examine them all together, that's another world of why you have multiple copies, which I'm not, at the moment, really want to get into.

10:57.877 --> 10:59.259
But what I'm getting at is this.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.663
What if you can have 40?

11:01.683 --> 11:03.125
Would you have 40?

11:03.145 --> 11:11.777
In 17th century American imprints, I will buy all that I can get my hands on and not yet dispose of.

11:12.500 --> 11:21.751
In 18th century American inference, I have many multiple copies, and I'm in the process of saying, well, here's an example.

11:23.854 --> 11:38.031
I have a copy of Jonathan Edwards' Freedom of Will, or whatever the hell it is, very important, Inquiry in the Freedom of Will, very important, a seminal book on, let's say, American thinking, free thinking.

11:38.811 --> 11:41.815
Now I have a copy in a contemporary binding tool

11:41.963 --> 11:42.784
Very nice copy.

11:42.804 --> 11:48.911
And I have the Brindley copy in Later Rappers.

11:48.931 --> 11:49.331
Beautiful.

11:49.471 --> 11:50.272
Very nice copy.

11:50.292 --> 11:51.334
Do I need both of them?

11:51.534 --> 11:53.396
No, but I probably will keep both.

11:53.436 --> 11:54.757
Do you have the Brindley?

11:54.837 --> 11:55.498
I don't know.

11:55.698 --> 11:59.142
I have a number, maybe 30 or 40 Brindley copies, if not more.

11:59.603 --> 12:05.229
But what I'm saying is, there's no... That does not come inexpensively, I don't think.

12:05.249 --> 12:06.030
What's inexpensive?

12:06.820 --> 12:10.584
The book's an important book, so I mean, it's not a question if you come to ten dollars.

12:10.604 --> 12:12.466
Less than the market will bear at any given point.

12:12.486 --> 12:16.029
No, that's irrelevant, but the market's imperfect.

12:16.189 --> 12:19.773
I'm not even, if you want to discuss economics of the market, it's another thing.

12:19.813 --> 12:24.317
But the point I'm saying is that I probably will keep both of them.

12:24.337 --> 12:29.943
I have no compelling reason to keep them, except they're nice, and I'm a collector, and I keep them.

12:30.063 --> 12:34.988
On the other hand, if I have ten copies of a sermon by Moses Levin,

12:35.305 --> 12:37.207
And they're all the same, uncut.

12:37.227 --> 12:42.452
I don't need nine copies, but I bought them, and when I get rid of them, I'll get rid of them.

12:42.652 --> 12:46.375
I have so many catalogs of Huntington... Dupes.

12:46.736 --> 12:47.216
Dupes.

12:47.236 --> 12:47.797
Ain't they nice?

12:48.457 --> 12:50.259
Yeah, I think they're not like nothing.

12:50.279 --> 13:02.410
I think that at the Worcester Fair, which I'm on the board of the Guarded Library, L&T Restbets, they came up, and he said, take everything you want to give to us, and I said, between boxes,

13:03.318 --> 13:04.059
You got the Huntington?

13:04.199 --> 13:05.040
Oh, wonderful.

13:05.080 --> 13:07.203
I read them all the time.

13:07.283 --> 13:07.543
I know.

13:07.563 --> 13:08.885
I read them all the time.

13:09.045 --> 13:09.646
Are yours priced?

13:10.387 --> 13:11.548
I paid $50.

13:11.629 --> 13:12.690
No, no, no.

13:12.890 --> 13:13.611
The individual price.

13:13.631 --> 13:14.312
Oh, you mean the price?

13:14.392 --> 13:15.213
Yeah, the price.

13:15.233 --> 13:15.834
They're wonderful.

13:15.854 --> 13:17.075
Well, they all came from Yale.

13:17.216 --> 13:19.619
They were Yale's copies.

13:19.959 --> 13:21.821
I don't know where he got them.

13:21.962 --> 13:22.382
Whatever.

13:23.263 --> 13:23.864
Great stuff.

13:24.084 --> 13:25.286
They're all Yale's copies.

13:25.346 --> 13:26.207
Yale, the accession?

13:26.227 --> 13:27.208
I can't imagine.

13:27.228 --> 13:30.092
Well, the point I'm saying is that I'm still in the process.

13:31.033 --> 13:32.515
My collection...

13:33.085 --> 13:35.587
is still in the process of being formed.

13:35.607 --> 13:38.470
But when you say to me, once formed... How old are you?

13:38.490 --> 13:38.710
53.

13:39.310 --> 13:43.454
Once formed... So, I don't ask that.

13:44.595 --> 13:46.757
I'm just curious, because you've got good 20, 30 years.

13:46.777 --> 13:47.457
Yeah.

13:47.477 --> 13:47.678
Okay.

13:47.838 --> 13:50.660
So, once formed... There was a purpose to that question.

13:50.680 --> 13:50.780
Yeah.

13:50.800 --> 14:02.130
That's what I'm saying to you, that I figure that if I can go along collecting, when I'm done collecting, when I am at the point where I am no longer able or what have you to collect, I should have

14:03.359 --> 14:11.532
10,000 American imprints before 1800, in varying conditions, great to nothing.

14:11.552 --> 14:14.296
And you ask me, what am I going to do with the collection?

14:15.157 --> 14:23.470
And my thinking at the moment is, as I said to you, no one needs a third tip.

14:23.490 --> 14:32.083
If I were to put the collection up at auction, like Streeter did with his collection, and fund the major libraries that I'm interested in,

14:32.553 --> 14:58.611
helping and do help, and give them, let's say, a draw, you know, a do-bill on the collection, they can bid up to X dollars, then the collection will be disseminated and distilled so that those major holdings are added to, as they wish, and the stuff gets out into the action, which everyone will enjoy.

14:58.945 --> 15:07.056
There's nothing that I own, I think, and because of what I'm doing, that needs to transcend me.

15:07.096 --> 15:08.518
I don't need a money.

15:08.538 --> 15:10.520
So therefore, the satisfaction is personal, isn't it?

15:11.001 --> 15:13.925
The satisfaction is personal, but it's more than personal.

15:13.945 --> 15:25.660
It's like, you know, an ant carrying... All I'm doing is I happen to be able to be at a point in time, and you start looking philosophically at life, why are you here?

15:27.042 --> 15:28.564
Besides gratifying your...

15:28.882 --> 15:43.736
I'm able to simply synthesize some disparate things that are around and pull together stuff that might otherwise ever disappear and pass it along.

15:43.756 --> 15:44.016
That's it.

15:44.617 --> 15:45.458
Pass it through my kidneys.

15:45.638 --> 15:51.804
Well, I believe that, personally, I think it's important.

15:51.824 --> 15:55.007
This stuff has to go out and be recycled.

15:55.291 --> 16:01.116
I do too, but I'm saying is that... Basically, the collector takes better care of things.

16:01.237 --> 16:02.037
Of course.

16:02.238 --> 16:11.086
If Dick Manning pays $2 million for Shakespeare, you can bet your ass he's going to take very good care of those four books.

16:11.887 --> 16:13.548
I take care of my books, okay?

16:13.568 --> 16:23.037
But what I'm saying is, if there's any importance to what I'm doing, it's in the synthesis of accreting to myself.

16:24.147 --> 16:29.114
all of this shit that's around, which is less around than people realize.

16:30.136 --> 16:32.038
Do you see yourself as a preserver?

16:32.058 --> 16:33.000
Oh, yes.

16:33.060 --> 16:35.944
Are you saving things from destruction?

16:36.004 --> 16:38.548
Yeah.

16:39.029 --> 16:41.092
Am I saving things from destruction?

16:41.292 --> 16:43.014
I wouldn't categorize it that way.

16:43.074 --> 16:43.996
I'm saving things.

16:44.336 --> 16:45.017
I'm saving things.

16:45.037 --> 16:45.338
That's all.

16:45.398 --> 16:47.140
Let me put you a softball, okay?

16:47.180 --> 16:51.026
That's one of the themes of my book, Out of the Park.

16:51.286 --> 16:53.850
The collector, as far as I'm concerned,

16:54.269 --> 17:01.282
is responsible, in many cases, Annette, right this time, for the preservation of human achievement.

17:02.384 --> 17:10.939
There are things which would disappear if it weren't for some apric, some gold, some obsessed person who collects and saves.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.083
I went to Peabys' library.

17:13.123 --> 17:15.467
Peabys has thousands of things.

17:15.751 --> 17:17.795
that are nowhere else to be found.

17:17.915 --> 17:20.079
But it's not obsession, you see.

17:20.099 --> 17:21.582
Isaiah Thomas is that one.

17:21.602 --> 17:22.303
I think that.

17:22.323 --> 17:24.246
That's where Rogers started as wrong.

17:24.327 --> 17:25.028
Of course he is.

17:25.048 --> 17:25.910
But I think that.

17:26.050 --> 17:29.356
Well, I said to Leonard Baskin, he loves the American interpreter.

17:29.376 --> 17:32.241
I said, well, I said, the guy said things like fairy pieces.

17:32.795 --> 17:34.819
Ferry tickets are very important.

17:35.881 --> 17:37.724
Ferry tickets are very important.

17:38.045 --> 17:42.173
I wanted to start collecting.

17:42.714 --> 17:48.685
I was thinking about trying to figure out how I could start collecting credit cards of the 40s and 50s and 60s.

17:48.766 --> 17:50.208
I think that's an area of credit cards.

17:50.469 --> 17:51.852
Very interesting, isn't it?

17:52.052 --> 17:53.354
Yeah, you think about credit cards.

17:53.374 --> 17:54.396
They wouldn't be plastic.

17:54.416 --> 17:55.258
Yeah, they're all plastic.

17:55.492 --> 17:58.556
I used to take my mother's credit card.

17:58.757 --> 17:59.478
What was it important?

17:59.498 --> 18:00.659
I mean, it was a prestigious thing.

18:00.679 --> 18:01.260
You had a credit card?

18:01.280 --> 18:02.922
It was a thing, but they ran it through a thing.

18:02.942 --> 18:03.463
That's right.

18:03.684 --> 18:05.166
It didn't go off into a computer place.

18:05.206 --> 18:06.848
It was a plate.

18:06.868 --> 18:07.649
It was a plate.

18:07.889 --> 18:11.915
Well, it was a plate, but in the very early gas cards, you know, it was very prestigious.

18:11.935 --> 18:13.397
You had a very good bank account.

18:13.858 --> 18:18.404
You know, the phone company realized that if they had an answering machine... Of course they are.

18:19.145 --> 18:21.128
But the thing that I'm saying is that

18:21.682 --> 18:30.112
that collecting, the instinct of collecting, I think, is one of the primary primitive instincts of mankind.

18:30.593 --> 18:38.403
Every society collects, whether it's cowry beads or leaves or shells or coins, it doesn't matter what it is.

18:39.264 --> 18:50.878
The instinct of collecting, which is the mirror image of, I guess, your existence on Earth, or man's existence, whatever it may be, is

18:51.297 --> 18:53.941
satisfying in itself to recognize.

18:53.961 --> 18:56.404
When you say to me, do I collect a preserve?

18:56.805 --> 18:59.789
I collect because it's imprinted in me.

19:00.610 --> 19:10.685
I happen to have come across an area of collecting that is immensely satisfying to me, which is book collecting, and in the area with the limits that I have, which is limits of language.

19:11.386 --> 19:15.572
I mean, I don't speak another language well enough to bother to read.

19:15.592 --> 19:17.935
I mean, I can get along with a couple of languages.

19:18.636 --> 19:20.038
But the idea

19:20.795 --> 19:34.998
of collecting, you can, and I think you might before you get the, you want to look at what instincts make humans collect?

19:35.158 --> 19:36.040
What do people collect?

19:36.060 --> 19:37.162
They collect everything.

19:37.182 --> 19:44.794
The best thing I could tell you, there's a magazine called the Antique Trader, and if you've never seen it, you shouldn't write your book before you see it.

19:45.803 --> 19:46.424
You buy it.

19:46.444 --> 19:48.787
I don't know where the hell it's published, but find it.

19:48.807 --> 19:50.108
It's not difficult to find.

19:50.188 --> 19:50.949
And it's published.

19:51.510 --> 19:52.711
And you look in the back.

19:53.352 --> 19:54.293
The Antique Trader.

19:54.353 --> 19:55.815
It's not made in Antique Trader.

19:55.835 --> 19:56.156
Okay.

19:56.396 --> 19:57.317
I've written in that.

19:57.337 --> 19:57.517
Okay.

19:58.018 --> 20:00.161
But you look in the back of the Antique Trader.

20:00.441 --> 20:02.724
Can you see what people collect?

20:02.744 --> 20:03.565
They have the want ads.

20:03.605 --> 20:05.207
Just read them.

20:05.787 --> 20:09.172
They collect bottle caps and magical cards.

20:09.192 --> 20:11.875
I served in Vietnam and came back to the elbows.

20:11.895 --> 20:13.136
Okay.

20:13.156 --> 20:13.617
There you go.

20:14.862 --> 20:17.365
But that's the type of... No, no, no.

20:17.505 --> 20:21.431
That's... Well, I raise it because people do collect everything.

20:21.451 --> 20:22.512
Well, okay.

20:22.592 --> 20:23.814
These are trophies, perhaps.

20:23.914 --> 20:25.256
Those are trophies as such.

20:25.276 --> 20:33.767
But what I'm saying is that getting beyond, let's say, that specific idea of scalps or what... People collected scalps.

20:34.888 --> 20:35.469
And you're right.

20:35.529 --> 20:40.556
You're absolutely... I was with Johnny Jenkins one day.

20:40.596 --> 20:44.481
Kenny Rendell had Napoleon's nuts at one of the book fairs.

20:44.917 --> 20:46.261
And he wanted 20 grand for it.

20:46.441 --> 20:48.286
And I was with you on it.

20:48.587 --> 20:49.810
No question, they are.

20:50.191 --> 20:52.638
Absolutely, totally not.

20:53.099 --> 20:55.326
Ask Bill Reese or what, or Reese or Ginsberg.

20:55.526 --> 20:57.632
The story is known, okay?

20:58.214 --> 21:00.580
The doctor came in and cut off his fucking nuts.

21:00.948 --> 21:03.652
and this pecker, and they had it.

21:03.712 --> 21:05.455
Redwood is one of the great relics around.

21:05.695 --> 21:06.917
How come I'm nervous?

21:06.937 --> 21:07.477
Well, how come?

21:07.497 --> 21:08.219
Because you're a Greek.

21:08.579 --> 21:12.785
Anyway, so I'm at the book fair, and Rendell's got it.

21:13.066 --> 21:13.907
I think it was Rendell.

21:13.927 --> 21:14.387
Rendell's got it?

21:14.448 --> 21:15.469
He's an autograph guy.

21:15.489 --> 21:16.791
What are you doing with these things?

21:16.831 --> 21:19.475
He had it, and he wanted 20 grand for it.

21:19.835 --> 21:25.844
And Johnny came up to him and said, Johnny came up to him and said, maybe he owns it now.

21:26.425 --> 21:30.010
He said, look, I don't want to buy it, but will you rent it to me?

21:30.412 --> 21:32.014
For an hour for a hundred bucks.

21:32.815 --> 21:34.338
Oh, come on!

21:34.358 --> 21:35.479
Kenny said, yes.

21:35.579 --> 21:37.242
And Johnny gave him a hundred dollars.

21:38.003 --> 21:43.370
And Johnny said, I just wanted to have Napoleon's nuts in my hand for an hour.

21:43.390 --> 21:43.851
True story.

21:43.911 --> 21:44.312
True story.

21:46.415 --> 21:48.197
How do they get removed?

21:48.318 --> 21:48.618
Oh, yes.

21:48.738 --> 21:49.139
Oh, yes.

21:49.239 --> 21:49.619
We know.

21:49.679 --> 21:50.200
You don't know.

21:50.240 --> 21:52.343
But I'm telling you, yes, the knowledge of that is known.

21:52.824 --> 21:55.608
And it is not apocryphal in any sense of the word.

21:55.628 --> 21:57.070
How did they preserve all of these?

21:57.170 --> 21:57.551
They didn't.

21:57.611 --> 21:58.512
They were desiccated.

22:00.719 --> 22:03.603
There it is, you know, a little piece of shriveled flesh like the yellow.

22:04.104 --> 22:11.195
But the idea, again, of the question of collecting, what motivates and drives people to collect?

22:11.215 --> 22:16.704
And I'm not talking, I think that even the idea of prestige, the idea of buying paintings and hanging them on the wall.

22:17.084 --> 22:21.411
Why is a picture, you know, a thousand dollar book is an expensive book.

22:22.488 --> 22:26.182
I'm not saying that I spent more myself.

22:26.242 --> 22:27.767
I'm trying to say something.

22:27.908 --> 22:30.939
It doesn't matter whether you have my means or you don't have my means.

22:31.200 --> 22:34.472
A thousand dollar book is an expensive book.

22:35.465 --> 22:38.388
I didn't say it's expensive to me or it's expensive to you.

22:38.708 --> 22:40.109
It's an expensive book.

22:40.630 --> 22:44.613
A thousand dollar... It's a lot of fucking money to spend for a book.

22:44.813 --> 22:45.274
No, no.

22:45.454 --> 22:53.921
But a painting or a print or a piece of silver... A painting is a unique expression of a creative person.

22:53.941 --> 22:56.323
Or a print or a Picasso printer or what do you call it?

22:56.343 --> 22:57.444
Print or what have you.

22:57.464 --> 23:05.151
The idea that I'm getting at is that people who collect

23:05.738 --> 23:08.301
and dealing with your gentle mania.

23:09.642 --> 23:10.783
Gentle madness.

23:10.803 --> 23:11.184
Whatever.

23:12.725 --> 23:13.606
Gentle, by the way.

23:13.626 --> 23:15.008
It's an ironic title.

23:15.508 --> 23:16.229
I know.

23:16.930 --> 23:33.147
The idea of trying to channel it in a parallel way, open up parallel channels of collecting, and start equating absolute value.

23:33.818 --> 23:44.808
to objects and what is expensive, that books are cheap, books are plentiful and cheap, as opposed to anything else in the world of collecting.

23:44.868 --> 24:02.003
But people who collect, and for whatever reasons they collect, for prestige, for ego, for pleasure, for preservation of knowledge,

24:03.603 --> 24:08.388
Whatever it is, in the end, they preserve.

24:10.390 --> 24:13.113
Because they collect, objects are preserved.

24:13.853 --> 24:18.518
More so, or not more so, but in many ways different from institutional.

24:19.419 --> 24:22.202
Institution, the idea, they preserve these objects.

24:22.282 --> 24:26.246
These are, you know, identifications of the human existence.

24:26.506 --> 24:28.328
An institution is precisely that.

24:28.595 --> 24:34.684
Ed Wolfe was telling me when he came in and took over the library company in Philadelphia, garbage.

24:35.445 --> 24:37.308
Yeah, but he found stuff.

24:37.328 --> 24:37.608
Stuff.

24:37.929 --> 24:38.710
Wonderful.

24:38.730 --> 24:39.651
He found them.

24:39.671 --> 24:42.075
Yeah, this is not one of my typos.

24:42.095 --> 24:42.736
Follow with this.

24:43.137 --> 24:57.538
Okay, the idea of collectors and the idea of the function of collecting is in the, it's

24:58.227 --> 25:03.315
It really is the identification of a human with his existence.

25:03.335 --> 25:20.743
You know, the most important thing, I mean, my feeling is that the two great significant events of the modern world have been the invention and spread of printing in the Western world and the atomic bomb.

25:20.763 --> 25:24.589
These two twin peaks, as they call them,

25:25.379 --> 25:27.161
of intellectual thought.

25:27.201 --> 25:29.243
Everything else... How about the computer?

25:29.263 --> 25:30.444
Did it stick out between them?

25:32.086 --> 25:32.146
No.

25:32.166 --> 25:32.226
No.

25:32.246 --> 25:34.048
It's just, those are the two great events.

25:34.108 --> 25:40.154
The computer is essentially an evolution of the printed word, in many ways.

25:41.014 --> 25:41.635
Information.

25:42.276 --> 25:45.079
You know, the rapidity, the dissemination of information.

25:45.639 --> 25:48.342
Well, prior to the printed word... There's manuscripts.

25:48.402 --> 25:48.882
People wrote books.

25:49.062 --> 25:50.644
Yeah, but I mean, the Romans had

25:51.265 --> 25:53.367
You could do a thousand copies of a book in a week.

25:53.588 --> 25:55.810
You'd just have a lot of slaves who were very skilled copies.

25:55.830 --> 25:57.773
That's right.

25:57.793 --> 26:05.261
But, you know, in America, when printing, you know, got out in Maine's Germany... You know what?

26:05.341 --> 26:09.226
As this thing ages just a little bit, like it's a little fun, try it.

26:09.306 --> 26:10.067
It must be new.

26:10.287 --> 26:11.188
Very nice.

26:11.228 --> 26:13.371
Now it's nice.

26:13.391 --> 26:15.813
Oh, it's got a little bite to it.

26:15.833 --> 26:19.838
Right now it's nice.

26:20.543 --> 26:21.785
I love hard things.

26:21.805 --> 26:22.666
A little quiet, right?

26:23.487 --> 26:28.834
Let me digress and tell you a wonderful story about book collecting.

26:31.017 --> 26:34.001
That you will deal with any way you want.

26:35.783 --> 26:41.471
You know how to say, fuck you in Yiddish?

26:42.072 --> 26:42.713
I'd like to hear.

26:42.853 --> 26:43.353
Trust me.

26:44.014 --> 26:44.275
Anyway.

26:44.935 --> 26:49.842
Annette, write that down, please.

26:52.522 --> 27:04.635
Ten years ago, I get a phone call from a book dealer, from a book dealer by the name of Jim Rizek, who passed out of your can before you knew him.

27:04.976 --> 27:05.857
What a wonderful guy.

27:07.719 --> 27:11.243
A scandal, but a good scandal.

27:12.084 --> 27:16.689
And Rizek calls me up and says, you want to buy a collection of pornography?

27:19.131 --> 27:19.712
I said, what is it?

27:19.752 --> 27:20.713
It's a huge collection.

27:20.993 --> 27:21.554
I said, I don't want it.

27:21.574 --> 27:22.495
It's going to cost eight grand.

27:23.707 --> 27:24.188
Okay.

27:26.932 --> 27:34.843
So, without me, I'm foreshortening this end of it, but it's not really particularly germane or that important.

27:35.324 --> 27:38.729
Now, anyway, so I bought a collection, signed and signed.

27:38.749 --> 27:43.156
I sent a couple of my guys out to pick it up.

27:43.176 --> 27:44.678
Guys here from... No, not my company.

27:45.820 --> 27:47.502
And I sent them in a truck, and they go out there.

27:47.522 --> 27:50.767
They come back, and I say, you have no idea what you bought.

27:50.787 --> 27:52.870
You bought a house full of books.

27:53.457 --> 28:00.888
By the time I was done getting the books, there were 268 cartons.

28:03.912 --> 28:13.726
What I bought was essentially an example of the world of pornographic literature from 1950 to 1975.

28:13.746 --> 28:15.909
So we're talking about ephemeral things.

28:16.249 --> 28:17.231
No, pocketbooks.

28:17.691 --> 28:18.572
Yeah, pocketbooks.

28:18.613 --> 28:21.777
I bought 20,000 pocketbooks.

28:22.162 --> 28:26.946
10,000 magazines, 50,000 pictures, God knows what, filling up this box.

28:26.966 --> 28:29.889
They had to schlep the damn thing for weeks to get the damn thing in.

28:29.929 --> 28:30.710
What did you do with it?

28:30.730 --> 28:32.351
I put it in the basement of my office.

28:32.431 --> 28:34.013
I didn't know what to do with it.

28:34.173 --> 28:34.673
Let's go back.

28:34.753 --> 28:36.535
Why did you buy it?

28:37.116 --> 28:42.180
You know, you get on an airplane, you pitch hostesses on the airplane.

28:42.280 --> 28:43.962
Listen, you want to go on the back and play?

28:43.982 --> 28:45.123
You know, you pitch a hundred times.

28:45.143 --> 28:46.404
Someone says, yes, why?

28:46.504 --> 28:47.705
I mean, you know, why?

28:48.406 --> 28:50.788
So they are in trouble again.

28:50.908 --> 28:51.949
You know, because...

28:52.283 --> 28:57.028
The quantity and the dollars were reasonable at the time, so I bought it.

28:59.210 --> 29:00.632
Who put it together?

29:00.652 --> 29:00.912
What name?

29:01.073 --> 29:02.214
A guy put it together.

29:02.234 --> 29:02.894
He was crazy.

29:02.914 --> 29:03.335
I don't know.

29:03.876 --> 29:06.578
Was it a good collection, as such collection goes?

29:07.019 --> 29:10.022
It was a non-for-real.

29:10.042 --> 29:11.384
It was beyond comparison.

29:11.864 --> 29:12.245
It was good.

29:12.265 --> 29:13.446
Oh, it was great.

29:13.466 --> 29:17.931
And I'm sorry, I got rid of it, and I would say that I'm not unhappy.

29:17.951 --> 29:19.172
I thought you made money on it.

29:19.713 --> 29:20.974
Well, I'll tell you about that.

29:21.359 --> 29:23.922
This is, as I said, a great story.

29:23.942 --> 29:29.008
So I got the stuff, and I got it in the cellar of my office.

29:30.249 --> 29:36.976
And I must say, it is probably the only time of trash, unredeemable trash.

29:37.417 --> 29:39.179
Anything you wanted was there.

29:39.960 --> 29:41.341
So why did you send it to the dump?

29:43.343 --> 29:45.165
First, I never thought of the dump.

29:45.346 --> 29:47.468
I thought of only putting it out as garbage.

29:47.836 --> 29:48.817
Well, that's the same thing.

29:48.837 --> 29:54.265
No, no, no, it isn't the same thing, because I'm unfortunately a known personage in my village.

29:54.846 --> 29:56.108
I couldn't put the shit out in front.

29:57.330 --> 29:58.071
I couldn't burn it.

29:58.091 --> 30:00.194
I mean, it was too much stuff.

30:00.254 --> 30:03.498
I was, I simply... Right, you could do a box, two boxes a week.

30:03.518 --> 30:04.320
Take me two years.

30:04.440 --> 30:05.661
Believe me, whatever it was.

30:05.842 --> 30:07.344
I'm saying you couldn't dispose of it.

30:07.364 --> 30:08.846
I'm saying to you that you're wrong.

30:09.126 --> 30:13.973
I'm saying that I could not dispose of it in the area that I lived in.

30:14.013 --> 30:16.577
It was easier to forget about it.

30:16.979 --> 30:23.427
the fact that this tumor was down in the basements of my office, then to have to deal with starting putting it out in the garbage.

30:23.447 --> 30:24.648
The word would have gotten out.

30:24.688 --> 30:25.689
I didn't want the embarrassment.

30:25.709 --> 30:27.071
I didn't want the notoriety.

30:27.171 --> 30:28.292
Plus it is pornography.

30:28.413 --> 30:31.116
Plus it is pornography, and I had maybe even Dorian on tape.

30:31.136 --> 30:32.878
I had everything, child Dorian, everything.

30:32.998 --> 30:33.459
Oh, really?

30:33.499 --> 30:35.321
This was everything under the sun.

30:36.442 --> 30:39.426
This was the contents of a dirty bookstore.

30:39.546 --> 30:42.910
One of everything in an adult bookstore for 15 years.

30:42.950 --> 30:43.510
Wow.

30:43.651 --> 30:45.653
Were you think that's what this guy did?

30:45.802 --> 30:46.843
No, I don't know what he did.

30:46.863 --> 30:47.263
He bought it.

30:47.303 --> 30:47.844
He was a collector.

30:49.325 --> 30:52.208
So we called Kinsey, and Kinsey wasn't buying it.

30:52.328 --> 30:52.788
Who?

30:52.828 --> 30:54.230
Kinsey Institute in Indiana.

30:54.330 --> 30:54.770
Oh, really?

30:54.790 --> 30:55.290
You weren't buying it?

30:55.311 --> 30:56.952
I didn't want it.

30:57.212 --> 30:58.714
And I finally cut a deal.

30:58.734 --> 30:59.875
I called Johnny Jenkins.

31:00.015 --> 31:01.756
I said, Johnny, can I put it in your cell?

31:01.776 --> 31:02.997
You know, he didn't want no part of it.

31:04.619 --> 31:05.700
I gave it to Terry.

31:05.720 --> 31:09.363
I called Terry Halliday, who's now with Bill Reeses, when he was working for Ray Walton.

31:10.004 --> 31:13.767
And I said to Terry, I said, listen, I got this great collection of pornographers.

31:14.557 --> 31:17.880
It's trash, but it's comprehensive.

31:17.900 --> 31:19.302
And I learned something about it.

31:19.342 --> 31:23.766
I did, just get off the record.

31:23.926 --> 31:28.791
This was one of the great holdings of one of the aspects of society of this period.

31:29.552 --> 31:31.714
And most of the shit had disappeared.

31:31.874 --> 31:38.601
There's a guy named Cliff Shiner, who's the great dealer in pornography, the head of the- S-C-H-E-A-B.

31:38.621 --> 31:40.323
S-C-H-E-A-B, yeah, C.J.

31:40.343 --> 31:40.663
Shiner.

31:41.163 --> 31:42.825
We want to talk to him.

31:43.413 --> 31:47.497
the head of the emergency room at King's County Hospital, he's a doctor in Brooklyn.

31:47.517 --> 31:48.237
He's an MD?

31:48.257 --> 31:49.378
MD, yeah.

31:49.579 --> 31:51.040
He deals in pornography?

31:51.080 --> 31:53.942
The greatest dealer in America, and greatest authority.

31:54.143 --> 31:54.763
The greatest?

31:55.544 --> 31:56.445
Dealer in authority.

31:56.825 --> 31:57.786
Authority?

31:57.806 --> 31:58.987
On pornography?

31:59.888 --> 31:59.988
Yeah.

32:00.008 --> 32:00.528
That is G.D.

32:00.548 --> 32:00.749
Schiner.

32:00.769 --> 32:01.529
C.J.

32:01.549 --> 32:03.771
Schiner, S-C-H-E-I-N-E-R.

32:04.612 --> 32:06.654
And he advertises in AB regularly.

32:06.674 --> 32:07.935
You can call up Jake and get his address.

32:07.975 --> 32:08.796
Where is he?

32:08.836 --> 32:09.236
He works.

32:09.937 --> 32:11.158
And he's the head of the...

32:12.218 --> 32:15.463
Emergency room at Kings County Hospital, Brooklyn.

32:15.483 --> 32:18.087
Well, how do you suppose this happened?

32:18.388 --> 32:18.848
That's true.

32:19.169 --> 32:21.332
But this is an interested and interesting person.

32:21.432 --> 32:31.708
Anyway, so I bought a collection, and I call up Terry Howard, and I tell Terry about it, and I induce him to take the collection.

32:31.909 --> 32:33.030
I said to him, here's the deal.

32:33.852 --> 32:34.913
I'll send it down to you.

32:34.933 --> 32:37.637
268 pounds.

32:38.018 --> 32:39.981
Yeah, I'll send it down to you.

32:41.581 --> 32:48.611
and you pay the freight, I never see it again, and we split whatever you get for it.

32:49.432 --> 32:51.115
How much did you get into it?

32:51.175 --> 32:51.495
Eight grand.

32:52.557 --> 32:57.925
I shift the damn thing down, comes up to Ray Walton in a truck, and they nearly died.

32:58.586 --> 33:01.951
Terry has to rent the warehouse, put it in the end of his mini warehouse.

33:01.971 --> 33:03.873
He shoved it in there for a year, he can't sell it.

33:04.955 --> 33:07.198
And he calls me up one day, says, I gotta get rid of it, I said.

33:07.639 --> 33:10.423
The deal is, you dump it, I don't care what he says,

33:10.876 --> 33:36.259
only thing we can do he says is this he said when johnson was president johnson formed something called the president's committee on pornography and insanity president's commission commission on pornography in 1968 or something like that johnson gave all of his papers to the hrc all of the committee's hearings are there all of the notes and everything

33:37.538 --> 33:40.262
They have no examples of American pornography.

33:40.362 --> 33:44.189
Would you give the collection to the HRC?

33:44.950 --> 33:46.232
I said, you got it.

33:46.252 --> 33:52.862
On December 30th of whatever year, 1981, they trucked the shit over.

33:52.882 --> 33:54.385
I spoke to my accountants.

33:54.685 --> 33:58.151
The university had physical possession of the damn thing, okay?

33:58.271 --> 34:01.676
So I could get a tax, you know, at the time I wanted a tax, I was going to get a valuation.

34:02.377 --> 34:04.761
And they valued the damn thing for about 68 grand.

34:05.146 --> 34:06.848
Did you receive it?

34:06.928 --> 34:09.392
No, I had Terry appraised it and valued it.

34:09.632 --> 34:13.157
But on the basis of 20,000 books or two bucks a book... That's fine, that's fine.

34:13.177 --> 34:15.760
No, no, what I'm... What you put into it was written to a challenge.

34:15.780 --> 34:23.411
No, no, no, but I'm simply saying that without getting into the question of true value, it was undervalued because the quantity was there.

34:23.791 --> 34:25.113
There were 20,000 books.

34:25.333 --> 34:27.136
Plus, you bought a house.

34:27.216 --> 34:28.197
Forget, forget.

34:28.217 --> 34:28.718
No, I understand.

34:28.738 --> 34:30.781
I'm trying... No, there's reason for this, I'm saying.

34:30.841 --> 34:33.364
I'm not trying to defend it from the point of... I understand it.

34:33.597 --> 34:36.821
It wasn't one book that someone said it's worth a million dollars or what have you.

34:36.901 --> 34:39.545
The quantity, the numbers, so many times, so many dollars.

34:39.765 --> 34:40.907
Okay.

34:40.927 --> 34:42.308
They received the collection.

34:42.889 --> 34:45.513
Apparently, Deckard Turner was never informed of this.

34:46.294 --> 34:47.555
Deckard Turner is a minister.

34:49.278 --> 34:50.299
Deckard was upset.

34:51.941 --> 34:55.526
The collection was locked up and put downstairs.

34:57.108 --> 34:58.470
At HRC?

34:59.010 --> 34:59.451
At HRC.

34:59.471 --> 35:00.693
I get an evaluation.

35:01.153 --> 35:02.255
I put it on my taxes.

35:02.375 --> 35:03.216
It's out of your hands.

35:03.466 --> 35:05.288
It's totally on my hands.

35:05.308 --> 35:05.688
Wait.

35:05.768 --> 35:06.489
It's gone.

35:06.589 --> 35:07.070
Okay.

35:07.090 --> 35:09.953
So now I file for a contribution.

35:09.973 --> 35:11.054
It goes before the feds.

35:12.135 --> 35:13.796
And the feds... They question it?

35:14.077 --> 35:14.657
...questioned it.

35:15.498 --> 35:16.299
And they refused it.

35:16.359 --> 35:19.322
They didn't want... No pornography was worth money.

35:19.803 --> 35:20.443
In April 4th?

35:20.463 --> 35:22.065
20 years ago.

35:22.926 --> 35:23.947
So back and forth.

35:24.748 --> 35:29.573
Goes to the engineers, and I'm fighting with the IRS for seven or eight years.

35:30.093 --> 35:32.055
I get this guy, Shiner, to go down, and

35:32.373 --> 35:33.054
Get permission.

35:33.074 --> 35:36.056
The feds, when they wanted to go in to see it, what do you call it?

35:36.237 --> 35:37.918
The Decker wouldn't let him in.

35:37.938 --> 35:38.459
Wouldn't let him see it.

35:38.479 --> 35:39.420
It was locked up.

35:39.440 --> 35:40.901
Okay, you know, they wanted to make an evaluation.

35:40.921 --> 35:43.564
Why didn't he get rid of it?

35:43.584 --> 35:44.424
Listen, wait.

35:44.665 --> 35:45.085
He didn't.

35:45.105 --> 35:45.826
It was locked up.

35:45.846 --> 35:46.246
It's there.

35:46.266 --> 35:47.707
It was a gift, whatever it was.

35:48.969 --> 35:54.013
I finally get Shiner to come in, and he makes an evaluation, says it's worth $150,000, $150,000.

35:54.354 --> 35:59.899
You meet with the feds, and the feds say, look, if you don't ask for an additional amount of money, we'll drop the whole thing.

36:00.301 --> 36:06.528
I was vindicated, that particular aspect was settled, and everything is quiet.

36:06.548 --> 36:06.989
So is that it?

36:07.650 --> 36:09.232
Three months ago, I get a letter.

36:09.252 --> 36:09.952
Three months ago?

36:10.393 --> 36:11.054
I get a letter.

36:11.294 --> 36:12.415
We're talking May of?

36:12.435 --> 36:13.737
Three months ago.

36:13.817 --> 36:14.538
May 90.

36:14.818 --> 36:15.519
May 90.

36:15.599 --> 36:16.380
Yeah, May 90.

36:16.400 --> 36:22.427
I get a letter from the dean of the University of Texas Law School, dear Mr. Zinman.

36:23.622 --> 36:27.367
We are now in possession of the Zinman Collection of Pornography.

36:27.668 --> 36:28.649
Oh, my God!

36:29.250 --> 36:32.455
And we are in the process of cataloging it.

36:32.575 --> 36:35.459
Capital Z, capital C. Cataloging it.

36:37.042 --> 36:40.386
And we'd like you to give us a CV on yourself and the history of the collection.

36:41.909 --> 36:47.036
And I called up this guy that had the library and I said, what the hell is going on?

36:47.557 --> 36:48.398
I said, listen.

36:48.749 --> 36:50.274
This is a great stuff.

36:50.455 --> 36:51.780
He says, we knew all about it.

36:51.800 --> 36:53.947
Decker Turner didn't want to do anything with it.

36:53.967 --> 36:54.870
He wouldn't let us touch it.

36:54.911 --> 36:58.202
We got him to give it to the library because the law library

36:58.958 --> 37:02.404
is very much interested in this type of... Was he laughing?

37:02.484 --> 37:03.986
No, he was very serious.

37:04.187 --> 37:06.250
And he says, I said, I've got to tell you something.

37:06.570 --> 37:07.833
Remember the guy's name?

37:07.973 --> 37:08.754
I'll give you the letters.

37:09.014 --> 37:11.358
I'll give it to you.

37:11.499 --> 37:12.200
That's a good story.

37:12.260 --> 37:13.001
Oh, it's wonderful.

37:13.021 --> 37:14.003
Wait a minute.

37:14.023 --> 37:14.584
Tell him the story.

37:14.604 --> 37:15.144
I know.

37:15.225 --> 37:16.627
I said, how the hell did you get it?

37:16.647 --> 37:17.368
He says, you don't know.

37:17.388 --> 37:18.250
You want to know we got it.

37:18.490 --> 37:19.752
So we're cataloging it.

37:19.732 --> 37:21.656
I said, but what is the Zinman collection?

37:21.676 --> 37:24.141
He says, when it was the deed of gift was the Zinman collection.

37:24.181 --> 37:27.007
I said, those fucking sons of bitches.

37:27.027 --> 37:29.011
You want to talk about immortality?

37:29.051 --> 37:31.997
I said, let me tell you.

37:32.077 --> 37:34.742
So I call up Terry Halliday and I tell Terry the story.

37:34.943 --> 37:37.588
Terry says to me, did you ask him about a book plate?

37:38.176 --> 37:42.981
And I said, ah, wait!

37:43.021 --> 37:45.904
He says, what about the Friends of the Zittman Collection?

37:46.224 --> 37:48.887
I called up McCormick and I said, Mark, you want money from me?

37:48.907 --> 37:51.669
You're going to sit on the Council of the Friends of the Zittman Collection.

37:53.531 --> 37:55.813
Isn't that funny?

37:55.953 --> 37:58.076
It is like... That's the HIC story.

37:58.336 --> 37:59.237
Isn't it wonderful?

37:59.257 --> 38:00.478
Did you ever talk to Decker Turner?

38:01.499 --> 38:05.123
I sat, I was invited to talk at Yale.

38:05.143 --> 38:06.664
There was a symposium at Yale.

38:07.319 --> 38:10.424
And there were people talking about collecting and aspects of collecting.

38:10.464 --> 38:13.689
And Deckard was, I was, there were three speakers.

38:13.809 --> 38:16.173
I was one, Deckard was one, and I don't remember what the third was.

38:16.674 --> 38:18.056
And I was sitting next to Deckard.

38:18.156 --> 38:22.383
I couldn't understand why he was so... Buggy.

38:22.704 --> 38:24.987
No, not buggy, but let's say a little bit distant.

38:26.189 --> 38:26.610
And...

38:26.742 --> 38:36.971
I didn't know whether he was a minister or what have you, and I mean, here was this thing that started from, I didn't want the fucking thing, I just shipped it off down there, but now it's got a life of its own, the Zinman collection.

38:37.031 --> 38:40.674
Just, did you tell me, I don't remember precisely how you got it?

38:41.435 --> 38:44.638
I just got it from this guy Rizik, Rizik Tittany, and I bought it.

38:45.639 --> 38:46.319
So I didn't see it?

38:46.339 --> 38:46.479
Yeah.

38:47.620 --> 38:48.922
And you thought it might be?

38:48.942 --> 38:56.108
Yeah, big man for the buck, you see, that's what I'm trying to say, that... It was a single, no, it was a single volume.

38:56.476 --> 39:22.821
eight grand i wouldn't afford it but you know a collection thousands of books your unit price did you personally ever look through any of them uh of course i'm just curious i mean did they just come in and they went they did of course i opened some of them up i mean but uh i'm not particularly any idea who the guy was to put together uh some not not some not but i just was into uh

39:23.257 --> 39:26.160
He was into stuff, and this was the stuff he was into.

39:26.220 --> 39:26.640
He bought it.

39:26.841 --> 39:29.664
Was he a dealer or a closet collector?

39:29.684 --> 39:31.586
It was really, I guess, a closet.

39:31.706 --> 39:32.026
Whatever.

39:32.046 --> 39:34.769
This was whatever the gratification was he got to go.

39:34.789 --> 39:37.011
The more power to it, he seemed.

39:37.031 --> 39:39.093
Did he catalog it and all that?

39:39.113 --> 39:39.874
Yeah, some catalog.

39:39.894 --> 39:40.655
He catalogs it.

39:40.675 --> 39:42.377
There were a thousand movies there.

39:42.397 --> 39:43.998
I can take a leak over there.

39:45.540 --> 39:50.665
I think of what I'm doing, and that will give you a better flavor.

39:52.214 --> 40:05.786
I've got a question, sir.

40:05.866 --> 40:08.829
I know you are.

40:08.909 --> 40:12.452
Get some cheese there.

40:12.732 --> 40:15.375
Here's the thing.

40:20.159 --> 40:21.360
What I want to do

40:22.555 --> 40:24.898
as a collector.

40:24.918 --> 40:33.587
And there's no question but that I am absolutely heaven heels over in love with the printed word.

40:34.007 --> 40:39.213
And not so much the printed word, but the printed word on paper.

40:39.313 --> 40:45.179
The idea of the image of type on paper is something that I find to be truly beautiful.

40:49.203 --> 40:49.744
Stimulating.

40:50.163 --> 40:53.346
I mean, it doesn't matter what the language is.

40:53.406 --> 40:54.247
I don't have to read it.

40:54.348 --> 41:03.497
It's simply like, it's just the type.

41:03.638 --> 41:10.205
It's simply, I like the idea of everything that the letter on the printed page stands for and what it means.

41:11.166 --> 41:17.993
And what I'm doing in the idea of accumulating to myself

41:21.365 --> 41:32.200
And as I said, I can't be any more serious, and I don't want to overly overstress the point.

41:35.024 --> 41:40.412
The pleasure of possessing something for me is totally transcendental.

41:41.333 --> 41:43.016
I don't need to own anything.

41:43.196 --> 41:44.257
I don't care about it.

41:44.277 --> 41:45.499
I don't need possessions.

41:46.373 --> 41:47.154
Yeah, but you have it.

41:47.494 --> 41:51.420
But I have it, but I have it almost as a... I have it simply as a caretaker.

41:52.241 --> 41:53.883
Yeah, but you also started out.

41:53.903 --> 41:59.110
Oh, yeah, but the point that I sorted out is, again, to synthesize and distill and get together.

41:59.130 --> 42:13.849
I'm gathering this stuff together because by doing so, the act of gathering gives me pleasure, gives me satisfaction, gives me stimulus on a lot of areas, and is...

42:14.032 --> 42:19.379
simply, in a very, very minor way, not unimportant.

42:19.399 --> 42:21.482
I'm doing something that has some meaning.

42:22.383 --> 42:27.850
It has some meaning, again, simply on this basis of me carrying the piece of bread a couple of inches.

42:28.050 --> 42:30.974
All right, now a question.

42:30.994 --> 42:40.125
Will it be mildly ironic to you, 100 years from now, the only Zim in the collection that it endures is the pornographic one?

42:40.286 --> 42:40.746
I love it.

42:42.789 --> 42:43.009
I love it.

42:44.002 --> 42:47.266
I love it.

42:47.506 --> 42:49.348
I love it.

42:50.890 --> 42:53.473
But what I'm getting at is... But you had nothing to do with it.

42:53.493 --> 42:54.655
You were just a broker in that.

42:54.775 --> 42:56.136
I owned it.

42:56.156 --> 42:56.897
My collection.

42:57.137 --> 42:59.140
It came your way and you did it.

42:59.160 --> 43:00.461
That's what happens, you know?

43:00.602 --> 43:02.824
But it really didn't reflect your past.

43:02.844 --> 43:05.247
It should be named after the guy who put it together.

43:05.527 --> 43:05.928
Could be.

43:06.188 --> 43:06.709
You think?

43:06.769 --> 43:09.452
Yeah, that's why I wanted it, but it didn't.

43:09.719 --> 43:17.348
Well, you've got to understand it should have been, but those bastards down there, Halliday probably pulled that off and insisted it be named the Zillman Collection.

43:17.368 --> 43:19.170
What's the name of the guy that has it?

43:19.190 --> 43:19.570
I don't know.

43:19.630 --> 43:20.271
I have the papers.

43:20.311 --> 43:20.832
Do you get it?

43:20.852 --> 43:21.132
Oh, yeah.

43:21.553 --> 43:22.454
So we can get it there.

43:22.534 --> 43:22.914
Probably.

43:23.935 --> 43:25.017
Actually, we'd like to get it.

43:25.037 --> 43:25.637
I'll try to get it.

43:25.677 --> 43:26.358
I have it somewhere.

43:26.398 --> 43:27.540
Maybe they know down there.

43:27.560 --> 43:37.111
But in any event, what I'm getting at is that some of the things I'm doing, for example, I'm writing a book on the history of the American Bible.

43:37.131 --> 43:38.032
You were writing this?

43:38.052 --> 43:38.292
Yes.

43:38.862 --> 43:42.927
So therefore you are entering the level of scholarship therefore?

43:42.947 --> 43:44.810
Well, I've done about four of my books already.

43:45.711 --> 43:48.134
I asked you earlier if you were a scholar and you said no.

43:48.355 --> 43:49.276
That has nothing to do.

43:49.296 --> 43:55.584
Being a scholar and writing books, I mean, of all of the people in the world, I mean... Well, I don't know.

43:55.664 --> 43:57.447
That's what it is.

43:57.527 --> 44:00.511
A scholar is a... That's an oxymoronic statement.

44:00.591 --> 44:02.754
I mean, I'm writing scholarship is not the word.

44:02.834 --> 44:04.837
Writing fiscal implements may be something.

44:05.157 --> 44:05.918
But you read my book.

44:06.058 --> 44:07.300
Did I give you to write a fellow book?

44:07.398 --> 44:08.159
No.

44:08.180 --> 44:09.242
Oh, come on, you haven't?

44:12.047 --> 44:12.748
Come on.

44:12.828 --> 44:14.311
I thought I sent you a ratatouille book.

44:14.331 --> 44:14.973
Okay.

44:15.113 --> 44:16.636
You got one down here?

44:16.656 --> 44:19.301
Yeah, I'll give you a couple books I wrote.

44:19.922 --> 44:20.062
Okay.

44:20.183 --> 44:21.786
I've written several books.

44:23.569 --> 44:26.655
And... It's very important, by the way.

44:27.496 --> 44:29.178
It's very important to me to know that.

44:29.398 --> 44:30.620
Oh, all right, so now you know that.

44:30.640 --> 44:32.482
I'm very upset that I didn't know that before.

44:32.602 --> 44:39.311
Ah, well, it was the walkies, dealing with the, what do you call it, the, the... Well, I don't know.

44:39.351 --> 44:40.012
The hinderling.

44:40.032 --> 44:40.713
I'll give you the book.

44:40.733 --> 44:41.994
You'll love it.

44:42.255 --> 44:44.397
But I did a book on Audubon.

44:45.699 --> 44:48.883
They're not really books, but I mean, I published several books, which I had something to do.

44:48.903 --> 44:54.911
I did a reprint of the American Color Play books in the 19th century.

44:54.971 --> 44:55.832
I did...

44:56.183 --> 45:02.649
As a matter of fact, if I have it, I'll give you my last copy of your license.

45:02.669 --> 45:02.969
You deserve it.

45:02.989 --> 45:03.370
No, no, no, no, no.

45:03.450 --> 45:04.130
I have my own.

45:04.931 --> 45:05.752
That isn't the point.

45:05.852 --> 45:25.650
But the things that I've been doing have been, to some end, to promulgate the artifact of the book.

45:26.491 --> 45:31.237
Now, when you said to me, what am I collecting and how am I collecting and what does it mean?

45:31.878 --> 45:41.349
What you see here, unfortunately, is simply over there in that other room where you saw the early American imprints, that was my holdings up to about 1720.

45:42.571 --> 45:53.184
Now, given the opportunity to put all of my 18th century books on shelves, this building may be able to take it.

45:53.324 --> 45:54.085
I don't think so.

45:54.638 --> 45:56.121
I've done simply a lot of stuff.

45:56.161 --> 45:58.645
I have hundreds of boxes in the basement here.

45:59.426 --> 46:06.879
I have hundreds of boxes at my home, I have in my office, a lot of stuff.

46:06.899 --> 46:10.345
Do you have boxes of things that you don't know who they're in on?

46:10.465 --> 46:12.068
No, but I don't like boxes.

46:12.168 --> 46:17.457
I put them in boxes because I was moving and trying to get some stuff settled out.

46:17.690 --> 46:26.179
I'll give you an idea of... Do you have a guy to make these oak shelves for you?

46:26.199 --> 46:26.299
Yeah.

46:26.319 --> 46:26.659
Poorly.

46:29.022 --> 46:29.983
I'll give you an idea.

46:30.023 --> 46:33.447
I've bought more books from Quaritch, I believe.

46:33.667 --> 46:39.133
They told me that possibly only one other person in the history of Quaritch... In the history of Quaritch?

46:39.153 --> 46:43.357
In the history of Quaritch may have bought more books from them than I did.

46:43.377 --> 46:44.338
I don't remember.

46:44.791 --> 46:49.317
It has nothing to do with value, and value is minuscule, but I mean quantity, numbers of books.

46:49.758 --> 46:53.423
Could you do this often?

46:53.443 --> 46:56.968
Nicholas.

46:57.008 --> 47:00.353
Nicholas is wonderful.

47:00.553 --> 47:02.676
I have to run to the place.

47:02.696 --> 47:04.479
I have to run to the place of club mags.

47:04.659 --> 47:08.925
I bought a lot of stuff in Edwards.

47:09.327 --> 47:11.090
Very interesting.

47:11.430 --> 47:12.852
Anyway.

47:13.072 --> 47:14.955
Brian buys spaghetti.

47:15.396 --> 47:18.220
But what I'm saying, though, you see, but that's a different world.

47:18.320 --> 47:19.361
Brian buys spaghetti.

47:20.223 --> 47:23.748
And when you make a statement to me, the action is on the west coast of America.

47:24.389 --> 47:34.263
But I'm saying that... But I'm saying you make the statement that Brian buys spaghetti.

47:34.463 --> 47:39.250
Now, I would be... There's only one book collector of significance in England, and it's spaghetti.

47:39.601 --> 47:44.045
But ask Nicholas Barker to quantify the statement.

47:44.065 --> 47:46.607
What is a book collector of significance?

47:46.908 --> 47:50.791
How much money does Getty spend per year on books?

47:51.472 --> 47:51.772
Lots.

47:52.052 --> 47:52.372
Lots.

47:52.953 --> 47:53.293
Okay.

47:53.473 --> 47:57.917
Getty probably spends on books per year what California spends on books per year.

47:59.239 --> 47:59.679
Okay?

48:00.079 --> 48:07.566
And I don't know that, and I'm just trying to make some kind of... I think it's a fair... Okay, but the thing I'm trying to... It may be wrong, but it's not far wrong.

48:08.018 --> 48:14.264
What I'm trying to say is that the action in California is great action.

48:14.664 --> 48:15.104
Okay.

48:15.785 --> 48:19.889
If you're a bookseller trying to make your mark in California.

48:20.369 --> 48:24.513
If you're a Weinstein, Priscilla Giusellis, who says she does really good out there.

48:24.533 --> 48:25.393
Priscilla's okay.

48:25.413 --> 48:27.175
She's a very good associate.

48:27.195 --> 48:27.796
She's okay.

48:28.877 --> 48:31.759
There's not very much Priscilla wouldn't do to sell a book in Weinstein.

48:31.779 --> 48:32.159
I love Priscilla.

48:32.179 --> 48:32.640
That's okay.

48:32.760 --> 48:34.582
I think she's wonderful.

48:34.762 --> 48:36.203
She's wonderful.

48:36.453 --> 48:37.434
I met her only once.

48:37.675 --> 48:42.381
I met her at one of the sales.

48:42.401 --> 48:47.989
Okay, as far as my Modern American Fiction, I have on her three, four thousand bucks.

48:48.330 --> 48:50.132
Three, four thousand.

48:50.152 --> 48:59.946
And it's fun because when I was collecting in the areas I was collecting, which was at the time, early voyages and travels and early American imprints,

49:00.027 --> 49:05.014
You could go to not only book fairs, but little local book fairs and pick tables, whatever.

49:05.034 --> 49:06.416
It's like a nickel to buy a pinnacle.

49:07.217 --> 49:08.058
And you could buy books.

49:08.078 --> 49:13.246
And I was buying and bought and put together a very nice collection of American fiction.

49:14.227 --> 49:18.493
And I have that now, you know, so that's something to live in.

49:18.553 --> 49:25.784
But my library, the other rooms in the house that had books in it, I never could put them together.

49:26.485 --> 49:28.768
I never could get a room large enough

49:29.525 --> 49:34.390
to hold and house my collection that I could at least have access to and enjoy.

49:35.190 --> 49:42.177
And here, I'll be able, for example, to put up American Bibles.

49:42.197 --> 49:58.452
Now, I have a collection of American Bibles, which you saw three, but let's say in talking about, I'm doing a book on the history of the American Bible, and what it will be is going to be a leaf book or a portfolio of leaves from Great American Bibles.

49:58.955 --> 50:12.033
And essentially, I have multiple copies of every great American Bible, except the 1661 Eliot, which I only have half of, which I'll use some of the leaves for.

50:12.093 --> 50:23.248
And the second Eliot, I have three, two of which are really good, one of which I may break and just keep a New Testament and just use some of the leaves in the Old Testament, which is imperfect.

50:24.009 --> 50:27.173
I have two copies, for example, of the first Catholic Bible.

50:27.862 --> 50:32.488
I have four copies of the Aiken Bible.

50:32.508 --> 50:34.531
I have three, four copies of the Hebrew Bible.

50:34.591 --> 50:38.396
I mean, every important Bible I have, I have a group of things.

50:38.416 --> 50:44.364
Now, when you're doing business, you divorce your mind from the rest of your passion.

50:45.366 --> 50:46.727
Do you become a very good business then?

50:46.968 --> 50:50.533
Only until someone calls me on books or I get a catalog of letters.

50:50.553 --> 50:57.582
I mean, the way it works is that I generally, I get to the office

50:57.815 --> 51:01.459
Somewhere between 7 and 7.30.

51:01.599 --> 51:04.903
And I call A1.

51:05.043 --> 51:06.705
I speak to the deal with an A1.

51:06.725 --> 51:07.846
Generally every day.

51:07.866 --> 51:08.888
See what's going on.

51:08.908 --> 51:09.629
About 11 o'clock.

51:09.649 --> 51:10.469
Yeah, before noon.

51:11.130 --> 51:13.893
And then... Every day you probably deal with A1.

51:13.913 --> 51:16.396
Not a general rule, I'm on a phone table.

51:16.416 --> 51:20.040
Then... Oh, yes.

51:20.141 --> 51:22.183
And others.

51:22.483 --> 51:22.864
Whatever.

51:22.884 --> 51:24.225
A lot of them.

51:24.546 --> 51:26.708
They just shoot the breeze and see what's going on.

51:27.413 --> 51:38.304
Then from about, I would say, 8.30 to 9.30, I deal with some of my business.

51:38.384 --> 51:40.186
Then about 9.30, I get the morning mail.

51:40.967 --> 51:45.431
And my books came in, my catalogs came in, my business letters, forget the business letters, but the book mail.

51:45.671 --> 51:48.694
Then about, I spent about an hour, hour and a half on that.

51:48.715 --> 51:54.180
And about 10.30 or so, I had my business meetings.

51:54.920 --> 51:57.323
You know, unless I see something, I want to start with books.

51:57.383 --> 51:59.526
But I generally intersperse, unlike Keynes.

51:59.887 --> 52:06.576
Keynes used to do his business in the morning and play in the afternoon, but I generally intersperse it.

52:06.896 --> 52:12.945
When it comes to business, though, are you a committed businessman?

52:13.265 --> 52:14.247
Oh, yes.

52:14.928 --> 52:16.470
Is it something, do you enjoy that?

52:17.611 --> 52:17.852
Yes.

52:18.132 --> 52:19.654
Oh, no, no, I enjoy business.

52:19.674 --> 52:23.239
But, again, the business that I have is... Is this a business that you start?

52:24.521 --> 52:24.741
Yes.

52:25.514 --> 52:28.258
Can you briefly describe what it is?

52:28.318 --> 52:32.623
Basically, we run a company that deals primarily in international trade.

52:33.624 --> 52:39.432
And the objects of trade that we are involved with is construction machinery, heavy earth moving machinery.

52:39.452 --> 52:45.320
These are things that you build, these are things that you buy and sell.

52:45.340 --> 52:47.382
These are things we buy and sell.

52:47.402 --> 52:50.666
And as dealers, as representatives, as agents.

52:51.487 --> 52:55.032
And we deal also in the area of...

52:55.923 --> 53:04.015
the energy area, buying them, dealing with the major utilities, selling them... Is Earthworm a derivative of Bookworm?

53:04.395 --> 53:20.479
No, Earthworm arose from a series of... The name was taken from a series of articles that appeared in the Saturday... Well, it was...

53:21.269 --> 53:31.138
Earthworm was a fictitional name or a characterization of Catepillar, fictitious characterization of Catepillar Tractor Company.

53:31.158 --> 53:49.015
One of the employees of Catepillar Tractor Company was a writer and he wrote and developed a whole series of books on the Earthworm Tractor Company and a mythical salesman, sort of loosely patterned after, I would guess,

53:49.535 --> 53:56.925
a humorous series of events using the construction machinery company as the foil and as the basis for it.

53:57.045 --> 53:59.588
And I took the name, I think, in about 1960.

54:00.409 --> 54:02.011
And it's been that early since.

54:03.373 --> 54:05.516
Yeah, but... For 69, 20 years.

54:05.716 --> 54:08.600
So you've been a businessman since your 20s.

54:09.040 --> 54:13.486
Oh, yeah.

54:13.506 --> 54:15.869
But I think that more and more I want to write.

54:17.451 --> 54:19.474
And I want to write in the area of books.

54:20.247 --> 54:21.269
to do things with books.

54:21.991 --> 54:29.786
I, as I've said, I started to say I'm planning to do this portfolio of leaves from American Bibles.

54:29.807 --> 54:36.781
I want to do a book and expect to do a book on Incarnabula Americana, if you will.

54:37.422 --> 54:40.348
Leaves from, well, sugar.

54:41.746 --> 54:44.210
Well, Inconabula published in the UK.

54:44.390 --> 54:46.754
Inconabula is Inconabula published before 1501.

54:46.894 --> 54:49.459
Okay, but in Europe about America, sure.

54:49.479 --> 54:50.060
No, no.

54:50.120 --> 54:53.625
Inconabula... I can't imagine if there's any Inconabula published in this continent.

54:53.645 --> 54:55.188
Inconabula Americana.

54:56.430 --> 55:03.562
For, you know, everything's in the eye of the writer, and the definition of what is Inconabula.

55:03.622 --> 55:04.563
And what is Americana.

55:04.723 --> 55:05.104
Okay.
