00:01.904 --> 00:04.828
Okay, I'm talking to Kenneth Dowler.

00:04.848 --> 00:10.517
I'll put this close to you because what you say is much more important.

00:10.537 --> 00:11.018
Let's start.

00:11.118 --> 00:14.683
Are you proud of the library, the San Francisco Public Library?

00:14.703 --> 00:16.526
I think it's a world-class facility.

00:17.628 --> 00:21.493
Do you mind if we turn that just only for my tape?

00:21.514 --> 00:22.275
Okay.

00:22.295 --> 00:27.102
I asked you if you're proud of the San Francisco Public Library, and you said it's a world-class facility.

00:27.863 --> 00:29.325
You might just... Right.

00:29.626 --> 00:31.168
I think it was...

00:31.587 --> 00:32.849
magnificent achievement.

00:33.870 --> 00:37.275
Some people in the city have been trying to do it for 30, 40 years.

00:39.198 --> 00:41.682
And I was hired to build a new library, and I did it.

00:42.543 --> 00:45.347
You were specifically hired to build a new library.

00:45.888 --> 00:47.550
I think that's important to point out.

00:47.570 --> 00:53.158
At the time that I was interviewed by Dianne Feinstein, she said, can you build a new library?

00:53.258 --> 00:55.241
And I said, yes.

00:55.261 --> 00:59.267
Did she give you any, quote, marching orders, or did she say, build a library?

00:59.287 --> 00:59.367
Yes.

01:00.055 --> 01:04.319
Well, she only had three months left on her term.

01:05.760 --> 01:11.626
She wanted the library bill because she was starting to realize her own—you know, she was term limited.

01:12.767 --> 01:22.336
And so when elected officials get towards the end of their term, they start thinking of legacies.

01:22.396 --> 01:28.982
So I only worked for her for three months, and then she was off, and Mayor Agnes came.

01:29.536 --> 01:31.078
No, there's no question in my mind.

01:31.118 --> 01:37.408
I was hired by the commission that interviewed me, asked if I could do that, and the mayor asked if I could do that.

01:37.909 --> 01:39.391
To build a library.

01:39.411 --> 01:45.340
Did they have a sense of what they wanted in the library?

01:46.842 --> 01:51.009
Not particularly, no.

01:51.770 --> 01:53.312
I mean, you would—I mean, a library.

01:54.434 --> 01:56.357
Well, they wanted a bigger one.

01:56.377 --> 01:58.480
I mean, the old one was out of space.

01:58.780 --> 02:18.932
They knew that the old one was—if you go back to some of the press clippings from 1986, 87, those years, the press had been writing the old library for a long time, saying that it was a disgrace to the city.

02:20.043 --> 02:42.122
Well, I think, yeah, go back to a column written by Bill Mandel in The Examiner at the time my hearing was announced, where he lists what he considered the ills of the library.

02:42.622 --> 02:49.088
Unclean, unsafe.

02:49.709 --> 02:55.236
I mean, he has a whole column listing.

02:57.319 --> 03:04.969
And you've actually built a number of other libraries prior to coming here, isn't that correct?

03:05.049 --> 03:05.370
Right.

03:05.390 --> 03:07.312
This is my fourth main library.

03:07.452 --> 03:07.793
Really?

03:07.813 --> 03:11.818
But they're smaller, large.

03:12.338 --> 03:20.308
I have probably as much experience in building library buildings as anybody in the public library world.

03:20.328 --> 03:21.489
And the other three are?

03:22.250 --> 03:27.076
Colorado Springs, Casper, Wyoming, and my first library out of Colorado, a small one.

03:28.238 --> 03:29.659
I think they're on your website, too.

03:29.679 --> 03:34.906
I think you list them on the website.

03:35.867 --> 03:35.967
Yeah.

03:36.301 --> 03:40.827
You also wrote a book in 1984 on the library of the future?

03:41.208 --> 03:42.289
No, the electronic.

03:42.309 --> 03:43.731
The electronic library.

03:44.813 --> 03:49.620
Well, people forget the subtitle was the promise and the process.

03:50.761 --> 03:58.953
The book is actually process-oriented and not specifically machine-oriented.

03:59.473 --> 04:02.357
Maybe you could distinguish the difference for me.

04:02.698 --> 04:02.798
Yeah.

04:02.896 --> 04:05.339
Well, the technology's changed.

04:05.759 --> 04:18.734
I mean, back in the time I wrote the book until I got on the bookshelf, half the pictures would have been out of date if I hadn't paid attention to that, because the machines change every twelve to eighteen months.

04:19.055 --> 04:25.562
So it requires a different mindset to be able to deal with it effectively.

04:26.588 --> 04:45.006
At that time in particular, and still a lot of government agencies treat technology as a capital cost, information technology, when in fact it should be treated as an operational cost, because the lifespan of most of the components now are less than two years.

04:46.207 --> 04:49.570
How long have you been involved in libraries, I mean professionally?

04:50.311 --> 04:54.655
Well, I started out as a bookmobile driver in 1961.

04:55.073 --> 04:56.215
And this was in Colorado?

04:56.495 --> 04:56.836
Mm-hmm.

04:56.856 --> 04:58.058
You're from Colorado.

04:58.078 --> 04:58.578
Right.

04:58.598 --> 04:58.719
Right.

04:59.860 --> 05:02.224
Okay.

05:02.244 --> 05:07.732
And then how did you actually get into the administration?

05:08.593 --> 05:21.032
Well, I was just finishing my second year of my degree in history at the University of Colorado and needed a job that summer.

05:21.273 --> 05:24.237
So I started driving Bookmobile and they

05:25.111 --> 05:28.636
said that I could continue to work part-time as I finished my B.A.

05:28.896 --> 05:29.837
So I did that.

05:30.218 --> 05:37.067
And then I also worked in a branch library and a number of things there, but mostly driving a bookmobile at that time.

05:37.127 --> 05:40.731
Then I was admitted to library school at the University of Denver.

05:41.873 --> 05:50.464
But that summer I was in my Marine Corps summer camp, and they notified me that Denver had a job that I thought I might be interested in.

05:52.166 --> 05:53.688
The city of Denver?

05:53.708 --> 05:54.409
Denver Public Library.

05:54.777 --> 05:56.880
So I wrote a letter in.

05:57.080 --> 06:13.960
Anyway, and I ended up being hired for that, and that job was one of the very early cooperative interlibrary loan efforts in the 60s, where four counties, Denver and three other counties, had joined a cooperative.

06:15.502 --> 06:18.465
And my basic job was to run the thing.

06:18.605 --> 06:24.092
Essentially what I'd do is I had a panel truck, and I'd drive it all over the libraries in the Denver area.

06:24.680 --> 06:40.256
book in, stop at the library, deliver the books that they'd ordered before, pick up their request slips, and then the next morning I'd go to Denver very early in the morning and I'd find the books that I could find and I'd take them out.

06:40.656 --> 06:53.910
At one point I had a halftime clerk helping file stuff, but I had only done that about nine months, but I enjoyed it because I was out and about and I was driving around and

06:54.717 --> 06:57.180
I got to meet a lot of people.

06:57.200 --> 06:59.623
At that point I pretty well decided I was going to be a librarian.

06:59.843 --> 07:06.692
I was—I did start graduate school at Denver University at the same time.

07:09.815 --> 07:11.597
I was making my rounds one day.

07:11.658 --> 07:15.462
I went into the Arbada Public Library, which was— How do you spell that?

07:15.702 --> 07:17.805
A-R-B-A-D-A.

07:18.545 --> 07:22.029
which at that time was only about twenty-five thousand.

07:22.229 --> 07:25.253
It's a bedroom community of Denver.

07:28.517 --> 07:38.028
And the librarian there was a lady who'd been there twenty-six years, I think.

07:39.991 --> 07:42.213
She had not gone to library school.

07:42.233 --> 07:45.177
And the library was in a little old white house that had been converted.

07:46.152 --> 07:50.898
And I'd gotten to know her on my rounds, as I did most everybody.

07:52.600 --> 07:55.583
And I walked in one day, and she said, I'm retired.

07:57.065 --> 07:57.746
As Liberian.

07:57.766 --> 07:58.266
Right.

07:58.767 --> 08:00.910
I said, gee, we'll miss you.

08:01.130 --> 08:04.133
She said, I'm going back to Kansas where my family is.

08:04.654 --> 08:06.036
And I said, well, we'll miss you.

08:06.056 --> 08:07.577
I mean, sorry to hear that.

08:08.338 --> 08:13.625
And she said, well, yeah, you get down to City Hall, because I told the city manager to hire you.

08:14.345 --> 08:14.826
Okay.

08:15.464 --> 08:17.847
And I said, well, I've only had one class.

08:18.668 --> 08:20.309
And he said, that's all right.

08:20.329 --> 08:27.177
He said, they don't want to pay a degree librarian yet.

08:27.657 --> 08:36.147
So I went down and I interviewed, and we made a deal that I would take over as the library director.

08:36.587 --> 08:45.437
I could rearrange my schedule to go to school, and I started out at

08:45.738 --> 08:51.709
Below what probably normally would have paid a degree of labor in, but over the next year they raised it up.

08:52.671 --> 08:56.338
So I finished, by the time I was 23, I was a library director.

08:56.358 --> 08:57.320
And this was in what year?

08:58.242 --> 08:58.643
1964.

08:58.663 --> 09:04.013
1965 I opened my first library building.

09:05.536 --> 09:07.900
Not very big, only 10,000 square feet.

09:07.920 --> 09:08.742
It's still there.

09:09.802 --> 09:17.850
If you go back there, I think you would be surprised that for a building that's thirty-five years old, still it's pretty darn good.

09:19.232 --> 09:24.757
It's a branch now of the county system, but it's very busy, and the building still looks fresh.

09:26.099 --> 09:32.345
I was there in May, and it was a place to sit.

09:32.385 --> 09:37.210
Anyway, so then I went on there, finished my master's degree.

09:38.152 --> 09:41.235
built the library, got the budget up significantly.

09:42.236 --> 09:52.965
Then in Colorado, they had a lot of places where there was a city library and a county library, and the taxpayers had to pay for both.

09:55.347 --> 10:07.838
So I'm probably one of the few library directors that campaigned myself out of a job by saying it's not fair to the people of Nevada to pay county taxes for a county library that they never use and a city library.

10:09.269 --> 10:19.410
So we actually merged two city libraries with the county library, and I went over to the county as an administrative assistant to the director.

10:19.430 --> 10:20.953
Now, which city libraries are these?

10:21.074 --> 10:22.236
Are we still in the same city?

10:22.697 --> 10:30.433
Well, the city of Arvada, and it was merged into Jefferson County, which is a west side of down

10:31.898 --> 10:34.321
Is it still the Jefferson County Library?

10:34.341 --> 10:37.384
It's now a branch of the Jefferson County Library.

10:37.404 --> 10:38.345
See, this is new to me.

10:38.365 --> 10:40.288
I didn't know there were county libraries.

10:40.408 --> 10:43.291
In New England we don't have county libraries.

10:43.311 --> 10:49.478
Now Colorado and California have city libraries, county libraries, district libraries.

10:49.498 --> 10:54.784
What's the function of a county library as opposed to a city library?

10:55.422 --> 11:03.930
A lot of it's a historic thing in that most public libraries started out as city entities.

11:03.950 --> 11:19.366
But in the 1960s in particular, it was actually Al Gore's father who sponsored federal legislation to take public libraries out to the rural areas, the first Library Services Act.

11:19.386 --> 11:21.548
And so then there was an attempt

11:22.422 --> 11:29.371
Well, when you're going outside the city, then the counties become the next basic jurisdiction.

11:30.513 --> 11:35.339
So, quite a few county libraries were started at that time, but there are some that have been around for a long, long time.

11:37.462 --> 11:47.856
So, that was the first library that you opened, and we may as well go through all of them, if you don't mind, because you've got to, you know.

11:48.038 --> 11:54.644
Well, so I went over to Jefferson County as administrative assistant at a very interesting boss.

11:54.704 --> 11:59.909
He used to be a paper bag student from New Orleans.

11:59.929 --> 12:05.074
Anyway, it didn't take too long, about six months, and I decided I really didn't want to spend any more time there.

12:05.354 --> 12:17.725
So I was thinking about looking for another director job when I was called by the State Librarian of Wyoming, who said, Matrona County Library, which is in Casper,

12:18.633 --> 12:20.174
is looking for a director.

12:21.696 --> 12:31.845
And the librarian died in office, so to speak, and they also—he just passed a bond issue and they want to build a building.

12:32.506 --> 12:34.668
And he said, I know you've done a building.

12:36.469 --> 12:45.838
So I said I hadn't thought much about the middle of Wyoming, but they flew

12:46.392 --> 12:48.454
Jan and I up there, we had an interview.

12:48.574 --> 12:51.317
I liked the trustees, the people.

12:51.337 --> 12:53.559
I still have contact, good friends there.

12:55.201 --> 13:02.007
And so I went to Casper in 1969, built that building.

13:02.047 --> 13:15.741
That one was kind of a half way because it was a—they had an old Carnegie building that was in really bad shape, and they had added a wing to it in 1952.

13:16.750 --> 13:26.518
But they couldn't—the property line was owned by, I think, Northern Pacific or one of the railroad.

13:26.538 --> 13:28.860
So their addition ended up being a triangle.

13:31.022 --> 13:38.589
So it was a really ungainly arrangement of having the old building and then this new triangle thing.

13:38.949 --> 13:46.015
So what the plan was to take the old Carnegie down, build a new wing there, which was actually about

13:46.332 --> 13:51.016
I was three times as big as the triangle.

13:51.297 --> 14:02.748
Anyway, so that was a renovation and construction project, which also taught me some of the headaches of doing renovations, particularly in the library.

14:04.209 --> 14:05.450
So I built that library.

14:05.891 --> 14:13.538
Then about five years later, and at that time I was starting to work with television, cable television.

14:14.935 --> 14:16.637
and more of a computer.

14:16.777 --> 14:18.940
I went to computer school in 1968.

14:19.220 --> 14:20.522
And where was this?

14:20.542 --> 14:21.863
In Denver.

14:21.883 --> 14:22.424
University of Denver?

14:22.744 --> 14:25.587
No, it was an automation training institute.

14:25.608 --> 14:32.355
It was a private, specialized school, and essentially training people to go to work to run, operate computers, program computers.

14:33.477 --> 14:35.499
This was back in the days, the IBM 360.

14:36.220 --> 14:39.103
I learned to program an IBM 360.

14:39.864 --> 14:44.790
And at the time I was doing that, the first disk drives appeared.

14:47.555 --> 14:55.644
So I got pretty knowledgeable about the business systems analysis and how to program it.

14:55.744 --> 14:57.646
I'm not a good programmer anymore.

14:57.666 --> 15:00.569
I don't have enough patience.

15:01.810 --> 15:15.925
But I generally know enough about it to know whether they're performing the way they should, and I kind of pride myself enough to know if a computer salesman are feeding me baloney or not.

15:17.255 --> 15:21.259
So, you know, I phoned in Casper.

15:21.279 --> 15:23.141
I worked—started with a computer.

15:23.201 --> 15:28.987
I designed the county records system for the entire county—the sheriff, the clerk, the treasurer.

15:29.988 --> 15:31.930
The commissioners had been trying to get that done.

15:31.970 --> 15:36.855
They contracted a group out of Los Angeles who messed it up.

15:36.875 --> 15:41.980
And so the chairman called me one day and asked if I'd take that project on.

15:43.495 --> 15:55.767
So I have a great interest in the integration of information technology, ranging from manuscripts to fiber optics.

15:55.787 --> 15:58.029
I've always been a tool-oriented person.

15:59.571 --> 16:03.494
One of the things my father taught me was to take care of the tools and learn how to use them.

16:05.556 --> 16:07.518
What did your father do?

16:08.699 --> 16:12.523
Well, he started out—

16:12.993 --> 16:17.199
He went—a small town, eastern Colorado.

16:17.279 --> 16:21.486
He went to World War I. He got tuberculosis and came back.

16:21.506 --> 16:23.429
His dad ran a hardware store.

16:24.390 --> 16:33.023
So he came back and went into that business, and they failed during the Depression because they gave everybody credit.

16:33.944 --> 16:35.827
And so the hardware store went out of the business.

16:36.989 --> 16:42.477
So my dad became an electrician.

16:43.891 --> 16:52.482
And he was traveling around a lot at the time, all over eastern Colorado and western of that whole area as an electrician.

16:54.204 --> 17:01.153
And he fell out of a grain elevator and spent nearly eight months in the VA hospital.

17:02.314 --> 17:06.760
And the first time I saw him after that, he was in a total body cast.

17:06.780 --> 17:12.447
But he recovered remarkably well, but he couldn't be an electrician anymore because he wasn't mobile enough.

17:12.933 --> 17:20.021
So he learned to be a bookkeeper, and he finished out his career as a bookkeeper for a lumberyard John Deere dealer.

17:20.862 --> 17:27.389
But he said he taught you the importance of taking care of— Well, he had several values.

17:27.650 --> 17:34.017
One was he liked to buy new gadgets.

17:34.037 --> 17:38.502
Not gadgets, but if you see a new paint scraper kind of thing.

17:39.916 --> 17:41.318
bring it home and he'd use it.

17:41.558 --> 17:56.616
And one of the few times I ever saw him mad, he was a very patient person, was if us kids misused his tools, leave them out in the rain or, you know, as kids want to do.

17:57.818 --> 18:01.743
He wouldn't get very mad, but I could tell it upset him a lot.

18:01.763 --> 18:03.044
He always kept his tools.

18:03.204 --> 18:05.247
He could sharpen his knife well.

18:05.327 --> 18:06.869
He could sharpen his own chisels.

18:07.550 --> 18:08.691
He took care of his tools.

18:09.717 --> 18:14.784
And he taught me the value of maintaining your tools and taking care of them.

18:14.804 --> 18:22.014
And so, I mean, his tools were carpentry tools and gardening tools and stuff.

18:22.675 --> 18:25.098
Today we have a whole different array of tools.

18:25.118 --> 18:26.360
I mean, I still do that.

18:26.440 --> 18:32.028
I've done a lot of—I've done carpentry work, and I grew up on a ranch farm country.

18:33.410 --> 18:38.577
But the same thing, I look at computers as tools.

18:39.502 --> 18:48.092
In fact, in the book, The Electronic Library, I talk about the concept of a toolbox.

18:48.112 --> 19:00.546
And anyone in the library business, I feel, needs to have a toolbox, need to have tools in it, need to know how to use them, and need to know how to take care of them.

19:00.926 --> 19:05.271
The other value I learned from him, and probably my entire family, was reading.

19:05.471 --> 19:06.893
He was a voracious reader.

19:07.531 --> 19:14.258
very avid science fiction reader, which I tried, but it was too far out for me.

19:14.858 --> 19:17.921
So what are your reading interests?

19:18.422 --> 19:20.043
Well, it depends on where I'm at.

19:20.123 --> 19:27.691
If I'm into just pure relaxation, I tend to go for historical nonfiction.

19:27.951 --> 19:28.491
I'm interested.

19:28.591 --> 19:31.915
I majored in the British Empire history.

19:32.615 --> 19:35.378
So I still try to track that down.

19:36.218 --> 19:45.007
I enjoyed some fiction, basically more of the suspense thriller, Jean Le Carre, or those kinds of things.

19:45.027 --> 19:45.647
Entertainment stuff?

19:45.888 --> 19:48.110
Yeah, throwaway stuff.

19:49.311 --> 19:54.556
In Europe, I read a number of books they trucked along.

19:54.977 --> 19:56.959
They were just pure entertainment.

19:59.481 --> 20:04.386
You know, going back, I like the thread that we're following, as it is chronological.

20:05.125 --> 20:13.634
But going back to when you were driving the bookmobile and the woman said she's retiring, there's an opening.

20:13.874 --> 20:16.497
But you said you had decided you wanted to be a librarian.

20:16.737 --> 20:21.843
What, you know, what were the factors that went into that?

20:21.863 --> 20:23.344
I mean, why?

20:24.506 --> 20:29.371
Well, I mean, a number of factors.

20:30.172 --> 20:31.814
Working in a book place was nice.

20:32.494 --> 20:33.175
I enjoyed that.

20:34.420 --> 20:42.953
I had a chance on the book, Poohville, because there were some wait times to learn children's literature, because I grew up without children's.

20:42.973 --> 20:44.135
I mean, I knew Winnie the Pooh.

20:44.315 --> 20:45.237
That was about it.

20:45.257 --> 20:47.821
But in my house, all the books were adult books.

20:47.841 --> 20:53.489
So I grew up with Edgar Rice Burroughs and that kind of book.

20:54.671 --> 20:57.255
So I didn't really know children's literature very well.

20:57.573 --> 21:02.179
And so, you know, you've got 15 minutes to kill, you just pull a kid's book and look at it.

21:02.199 --> 21:05.443
So I got off into some of the children's authors, and I really enjoyed them.

21:05.463 --> 21:10.309
And then, of course, I have two sons, and they're voracious readers.

21:10.329 --> 21:12.612
Taught them to read at 18 months.

21:12.632 --> 21:16.236
And so, anyway, that was part of it.

21:16.256 --> 21:24.947
The other part of it, though, the part—and this is the part, I guess, if I have a soapbox or sermon—

21:26.513 --> 21:33.844
In the Book and Bill, I think I really came to see that the magic in a library is the connections.

21:36.128 --> 21:39.853
And so a library is greater than any one of its parts.

21:39.873 --> 21:42.036
A library is greater than its collections.

21:42.177 --> 21:43.599
It's greater than its buildings.

21:43.659 --> 21:45.422
It's greater than its technologies.

21:45.442 --> 21:48.646
It's greater than its librarians.

21:48.666 --> 21:51.711
We bring them together and bring the public into them.

21:54.577 --> 21:58.423
then you start seeing what I call the magic of libraries.

21:58.443 --> 22:06.755
People learning ideas, people exploring, people solving problems, people relaxing, people developing new skills.

22:08.057 --> 22:11.803
And so my focus has always been on bringing together.

22:12.724 --> 22:22.980
One of the reasons I started working with computers so early was you could inventory the collection with the computers, which you could not do on a card-based system unless you had a really little library.

22:24.057 --> 22:30.123
And so I've always felt a book in hand is worth a thousand, which you can't find.

22:31.385 --> 22:40.414
And so while the libraries need the collections, they also need the inventory, they need to know where they are, they need to have them accessible to people.

22:40.755 --> 22:46.401
And a lot of the historical librarianship, the emphasis has been more on collection.

22:48.082 --> 22:52.427
And so things are collected that they don't even know they have anymore.

22:52.998 --> 22:54.380
in every inventory.

22:55.462 --> 23:18.535
The inventory we did at San Francisco for over four years, we inventoried almost two and a half million books, which I, and you can try this when you talk to other librarians, I suspect is the largest library inventory in history because universities don't do inventory.

23:18.555 --> 23:20.558
Library of Congress doesn't have an inventory.

23:21.837 --> 23:38.062
So I'm very proud of that factor, that we, at the same time we were doing the building, at the same time we were doing the technology, at the same time that we were—a tremendous amount of change, we managed to actually locate our—physically locate our books and load them onto the computer.

23:38.082 --> 23:40.285
So you loaded two and a half million books?

23:40.385 --> 23:41.567
It's around that number.

23:42.288 --> 23:45.794
I think it was 2.4 when I left or something like that.

23:45.874 --> 23:49.279
And, you know, and I saw a tape where you were—

23:49.698 --> 23:54.666
Library of the Future, I guess it's called, and you did this around 1989 or so.

23:55.166 --> 24:02.618
And you say on that tape, as a matter of fact, that you were planning for two and a half, that this new building will hold two and a half million books.

24:03.819 --> 24:04.420
What happened?

24:05.221 --> 24:07.825
We may as well get into that at this particular point.

24:07.845 --> 24:12.452
Obviously, it can't hold two and a half million books, and it doesn't.

24:12.472 --> 24:12.853
Well...

24:14.858 --> 24:20.925
The first thing that happened was the Board of Supervisors took fifteen million dollars away from— How many million, I'm sorry?

24:20.966 --> 24:21.726
Fifteen.

24:21.746 --> 24:22.868
Fifteen.

24:22.888 --> 24:24.510
Which would have been the seventh level.

24:26.212 --> 24:33.040
When we went in with our building study, the building was planned to be 435,000 square feet.

24:33.060 --> 24:43.313
That required—and the challenge with that building was the building had to have the same footprint as the old one, and it could not exceed the height.

24:44.795 --> 24:46.137
Footprint meaning what?

24:46.237 --> 24:48.921
It couldn't be any whiter or any longer.

24:49.542 --> 24:50.083
Why is that?

24:50.404 --> 24:55.171
Because of the code, the way the Pacific Center is laid out.

24:56.733 --> 25:04.685
So we had to increase the space in the library in the same box, basically.

25:06.208 --> 25:11.055
So there was to be then another lower level, which would have been essentially stacked.

25:12.959 --> 25:19.908
When we went into the budget committee, the chair of the committee, he said, $120 million is too much.

25:19.928 --> 25:20.629
Cut it down.

25:20.689 --> 25:22.772
You also need some money for branches.

25:22.892 --> 25:24.294
Put it in and come back tomorrow.

25:28.199 --> 25:42.477
So the CIO, Rudy Knoppenberg, who was in charge of capital projects and I, went to his office, and we just simply put $5 million in for the branches and went in with $119.

25:42.929 --> 25:52.138
So, anyway, we lost that entire floor.

25:52.158 --> 25:56.262
That reduced the stack space by about 60,000 square feet.

25:56.923 --> 25:59.866
That's factory number one.

25:59.886 --> 26:05.912
Now, my fault—at the time that that happened, I had no way to counter that.

26:06.352 --> 26:12.278
I mean, the chairman of the committee made that decision, and in those days they made those decisions, period.

26:14.401 --> 26:15.963
So he made that decision.

26:16.003 --> 26:16.924
That's what happened.

26:18.546 --> 26:27.075
I did feel that a fallback for that one was because of the old convention center.

26:27.456 --> 26:28.037
Brooksville?

26:29.058 --> 26:29.198
Mm-hmm.

26:29.218 --> 26:33.182
That's why the entrance, the ramp, all of that is designed that way.

26:34.564 --> 26:35.946
That was in there yesterday.

26:35.966 --> 26:41.852
It's designed to essentially be incorporated as the seventh floor of the main library.

26:43.074 --> 26:43.294
Now,

26:45.367 --> 26:55.116
But that has not happened, because the decision to do that is a political decision.

26:58.619 --> 27:08.548
I feel, at least this point, I, up until I walked away, kept the city and the mayor and everybody else from giving it away to somebody else.

27:09.869 --> 27:14.293
Now, I realize it's not clean space—I mean, it's got problems.

27:15.117 --> 27:17.960
But it's the cheapest space that library's ever going to get.

27:19.282 --> 27:30.595
Because for something less than $10 million, you could renovate that and make a reasonably good space for books, collections, manuscripts, and people.

27:31.857 --> 27:36.182
So that, to me, was the only solution.

27:36.202 --> 27:37.904
That's factor number one.

27:38.685 --> 27:41.428
Factor number two was

27:42.337 --> 27:58.998
And when we get into the dumping the book issue, realizing that the San Francisco Public Library had not added one new inch of space to their library system since the 1960s.

28:03.283 --> 28:07.168
So you had a system that had been backing up stuff.

28:07.188 --> 28:11.213
In fact, the fire department threatened to close the main library twice.

28:12.408 --> 28:16.833
because they had books stacked all over everything, and there were big headlines in the paper.

28:16.853 --> 28:22.219
I mean, if you really want to research this, you go back and read the press at that time.

28:23.661 --> 28:25.302
At that time being what?

28:25.322 --> 28:25.823
The 60s?

28:26.183 --> 28:36.215
Starting in the 60s and just working its way, and Peter Wiley's book has more specific references.

28:36.875 --> 28:41.841
So that, anyway, so the first factor was we lost the

28:42.023 --> 28:43.865
60,000 square feet of spades.

28:43.885 --> 28:54.018
The final factor was that the library system had not been discarding at the main library any significant degree for a long, long time.

28:56.602 --> 29:06.314
Now, depending on who you talk to, but standard library practice has been that libraries typically roll over 6 percent of their collection every year.

29:06.334 --> 29:09.178
6 percent?

29:09.496 --> 29:14.101
If you go back into library science in the 60s and 70s, that's what they taught.

29:15.763 --> 29:19.107
And all over meaning that you removed 6 percent?

29:19.247 --> 29:22.250
Weed the collection 6 percent.

29:22.270 --> 29:22.430
Yeah.

29:22.650 --> 29:26.355
And, you know, I must say, Gina said yesterday, you know, this hadn't been done.

29:26.935 --> 29:30.219
I mean, that's why, and so, you know.

29:31.040 --> 29:35.925
Well, you have to go back in the context of the budget battles at the time.

29:38.099 --> 29:55.936
One of the difficulties, the challenges that I had, that frustrated me more than anything else, is I could not get funds to do, quote, administrative stuff, including planning, which was one of the other problems.

29:55.956 --> 30:05.625
And so backroom stuff didn't get done because we were using all of our staff essentially in public service functions.

30:08.238 --> 30:12.845
At the library, when I came, had an inordinately high number of librarians.

30:14.368 --> 30:17.733
I was very short on support staff.

30:18.655 --> 30:20.097
Do you think there were too many librarians?

30:21.560 --> 30:25.847
Compared to other libraries in this country at that time, they had more than most.

30:28.391 --> 30:30.294
No, I don't think they had too many librarians.

30:30.314 --> 30:32.878
I think they didn't have enough support staff.

30:33.601 --> 30:52.483
So there was no unit and no staff to actually systematically go through the weeding process, evaluate the books, and look for things that had value of them beyond the regular, everyday library stuff.

30:52.503 --> 31:02.595
In fact, one of the things I did when I came, I noticed that there were books on the shelf, on the open shelves, that were, in fact, rare books.

31:02.913 --> 31:06.896
process of moving them to special collections.

31:06.917 --> 31:12.722
In fact, one of the things I did before I left, I hired an honest-to-God trained rare book specialist.

31:14.183 --> 31:18.286
Also hired the city's first real archivist.

31:18.306 --> 31:19.347
And that's Susan?

31:20.308 --> 31:20.528
Yeah.

31:21.189 --> 31:22.830
She showed me around yesterday.

31:23.291 --> 31:23.511
Yeah.

31:23.531 --> 31:24.332
Interesting.

31:24.672 --> 31:26.334
So, anyway— Who is the rare books person?

31:26.754 --> 31:27.194
Pardon?

31:27.214 --> 31:28.756
Who is the rare books person?

31:29.116 --> 31:32.599
Oh, gee.

31:32.900 --> 31:33.821
He works up there.

31:34.121 --> 31:37.044
That's okay.

31:37.744 --> 31:41.147
He came, I think, just about ten months before I left or something.

31:41.167 --> 31:44.050
We did it at national recruitment.

31:44.070 --> 31:56.341
But anyway, there was no way I could take people off the reference desk or out of the branch libraries to deal with that kind of a program.

31:56.361 --> 32:01.185
The system also did not have a high degree of coordination between the different pieces.

32:02.650 --> 32:13.420
In fact, one of the ranch librarians said, well, I pulled books to read, and I sent them downtown assuming that somebody would check them.

32:13.460 --> 32:13.961
Do that again.

32:13.981 --> 32:15.222
I'm sorry.

32:15.242 --> 32:24.091
One of the librarians said, I was reading—the ranch librarian said, I was reading books—and this is the time of the controversy over the reading of books.

32:24.671 --> 32:30.497
She said, I just assumed if I sent them downtown, somebody down at the main library would look at them and evaluate them.

32:31.844 --> 32:33.427
I want anybody downtown to do that.

32:34.869 --> 32:37.213
I mean, we take people off the reference step.

32:37.233 --> 32:42.141
I mean, it's options and choices, basically.

32:42.421 --> 32:49.994
And the priority, my priority has always been public service to keep the branches.

32:50.014 --> 32:57.025
A lot of people don't realize that, and the charter amendment, the majority of that money went to the branches.

32:58.777 --> 33:05.667
We increased our hours system-wide by 46 percent, and the branches got more money than the main library did.

33:09.132 --> 33:12.878
In a way, the main library got kind of short-sheeted out of that whole deal.

33:13.078 --> 33:15.401
That's a long political story.

33:18.285 --> 33:24.835
The other factor then—I mean, first of all, you take a floor out of the building,

33:25.878 --> 33:33.890
You take a system that is essentially constipated, if you will, had not been renewing the collection.

33:34.211 --> 33:44.586
I mean, the branches literally could not buy another book unless they sent one someplace else.

33:45.528 --> 33:47.230
So one in, one out, basically.

33:47.250 --> 33:52.117
Yeah, because they were stuffed, stuffed.

33:52.137 --> 33:53.860
So, third factor—

33:54.886 --> 34:02.277
Ten was, I mean, when we started out, I had this conversation with Rudy Knothenberg, the Chief of Industry of Officer.

34:02.297 --> 34:05.361
He kept saying, well, why do you need a building that, $400,000?

34:05.581 --> 34:06.723
Why do you need a building that big?

34:07.805 --> 34:11.610
And I just said, he said, how big do you have to build the damn library?

34:11.630 --> 34:17.959
And I said, we need to build it as big as we can get it because we will fill it up.

34:19.001 --> 34:19.982
And the only question is when.

34:22.561 --> 34:26.546
Generally speaking, you build a library, you think at least 20 years of growth.

34:26.947 --> 34:29.090
That was the old planning.

34:29.510 --> 34:30.692
That's what they used to use.

34:32.094 --> 34:35.598
It's very difficult to do.

34:35.618 --> 34:41.887
If you actually have the options, you're smarter to build it to be adding to it on a regular basis.

34:42.027 --> 34:42.988
Adding to the library.

34:44.150 --> 34:46.813
Build it in a modular way that you can continue to.

34:47.047 --> 34:49.531
which is something not possible with the main.

34:49.631 --> 34:57.843
It took virtually every square inch of that block to build it as big as it is, and there's no way architecturally you can add to that building.

35:00.026 --> 35:05.173
So it takes us sort of back to the intersection of automation and collections.

35:07.396 --> 35:14.887
I have never viewed the main library as the be-all, end-all of the library system.

35:14.907 --> 35:16.750
I viewed it perhaps as the flagship

35:17.708 --> 35:19.590
of a fleet of facility.

35:21.231 --> 35:26.276
But I also knew, at some point, collections would be going into remote storage.

35:28.218 --> 35:29.179
And the question was, when?

35:31.602 --> 35:46.416
And the third factor, in that in 1994, 70 percent of the voters voted to essentially double the library's budget, out of which I tripled the collection budget.

35:47.678 --> 36:09.327
So all of a sudden, 1995, 96, if I remember my numbers right, and I was getting in trouble to not, because I don't pay a lot of attention, but I do know that it was either 95, 96, I think it must have been 95, 96, San Francisco Public Library added 160,000 books.

36:10.249 --> 36:10.950
In one year?

36:10.990 --> 36:11.290
Yeah.

36:12.721 --> 36:14.224
We tripled the acquisitions.

36:14.244 --> 36:15.927
Well, what kinds of books do you have?

36:16.167 --> 36:18.191
I think you get 160,000 books in one year.

36:19.874 --> 36:21.457
Well, we've got 26 branches.

36:22.760 --> 36:25.826
Oh, I see, duplication.

36:25.846 --> 36:26.266
Oh, yeah.

36:26.487 --> 36:27.489
And they were processed.

36:27.509 --> 36:28.611
They came through the door.

36:28.711 --> 36:29.553
They went on the shelf.

36:30.174 --> 36:35.083
Technical service essentially had to move 1,000 books a day or they got buried.

36:37.662 --> 36:41.949
And this was in the year just immediately prior to the opening of the building?

36:41.969 --> 36:43.332
Two years before opening.

36:43.552 --> 36:44.714
So that would have been in 94.

36:45.415 --> 36:49.722
So if you actually look at it, remember the building was essentially designed in 1990.

36:49.782 --> 36:57.816
One challenge of the library building of this scale is essentially the process will be 10 years.

36:59.258 --> 37:03.906
And how do you design a building for 10 years now?

37:04.882 --> 37:08.025
I mean, that's tough enough, let alone design one per a hundred.

37:10.567 --> 37:13.429
That's quite challenging.

37:13.449 --> 37:23.197
So, in 1990, we had no—we had a modest growth rate of the collections projected, and Kathy Page has her numbers.

37:24.218 --> 37:27.661
I think it was between 4 and 6 percent.

37:27.681 --> 37:28.982
What percent again, I'm sorry?

37:29.263 --> 37:31.044
Between 4 and 6 percent a year.

37:32.746 --> 37:34.467
When we tripled the book budget,

37:37.298 --> 37:49.650
We essentially went into the mode of, at the rate we were acquiring them, those two years, we would add a million books in about seven years.

37:53.173 --> 38:02.201
I mean, I'm using round numbers, but there's no question it was going up.

38:02.402 --> 38:05.525
So I go back and go back to the voters and get another fund?

38:05.545 --> 38:07.086
I mean, what's the option?

38:09.800 --> 38:11.482
So you tell me what's the option.

38:12.223 --> 38:16.688
A lot of people ask me, what would I have done different?

38:17.389 --> 38:25.659
Probably not much, because it was pretty much constrained by what could I have done different.

38:25.679 --> 38:34.709
So, no, I think, I mean, that's, again, back to why you have to have the computer, you have to have the inventory, because your assets will be distributed now.

38:34.770 --> 38:39.435
They're distributed in 27 facilities, and there will probably be more.

38:40.529 --> 38:45.534
And so you have to have a distributed system that works.

38:47.637 --> 38:59.370
Now, going from no online catalog to an online catalog in two years is a big jump.

38:59.390 --> 39:01.011
And there's still problems with it.

39:01.272 --> 39:06.597
One of them was I never got any more money to enhance the technology.

39:06.617 --> 39:09.000
In fact, I had to raise the first half.

39:09.098 --> 39:17.006
I spent almost two million dollars with a computer myself, because the city didn't want to buy one.

39:20.610 --> 39:33.945
So when you say, when people ask you what would you have done differently, I mean, you have to admit that it was a public relations disaster when it was discovered that 200,000 books had been somewhere already sent off.

39:33.965 --> 39:36.287
I think those numbers stink.

39:39.035 --> 39:40.456
I don't even think they're close.

39:44.280 --> 39:47.183
I think the figment of Mr. Baker's imagination.

39:50.226 --> 39:52.108
Sort of like when he measured the shelves.

39:52.128 --> 39:53.750
I don't know if you remember that.

39:53.770 --> 39:57.574
He was off 100 percent.

39:57.594 --> 40:04.941
The basic problem with those numbers is before the computer and the computer inventory—there was no inventory.

40:06.794 --> 40:16.346
And any semblance of an inventory was based on a three-by-five card system that had essentially broken down twenty years ago.

40:19.429 --> 40:21.312
Are you following what I'm saying?

40:21.332 --> 40:22.012
Yes, I am.

40:22.373 --> 40:26.318
Because nobody at the time knew how many books this library had.

40:26.458 --> 40:32.345
In fact, when I came in— But you told me that it was determined that there were 2.5 million.

40:33.346 --> 40:36.430
Those were loaded into the computer.

40:36.950 --> 40:41.536
And I'm saying there may be another 50,000, maybe another 100.

40:41.657 --> 40:42.117
I don't know.

40:42.478 --> 40:44.881
You won't know the final number until you've done it, right?

40:46.804 --> 40:51.070
That was one of the other problems of the move and the transition and the spaces.

40:51.210 --> 40:54.975
There were no accurate records.

40:54.995 --> 41:00.924
So how many government documents they had of photographs.

41:00.944 --> 41:04.729
There was virtually no management data in that entire place.

41:07.139 --> 41:16.672
I asked, had technical services, like the second dad came to work, how many books does this library have?

41:16.692 --> 41:19.836
And she said, we don't know.

41:19.856 --> 41:26.245
So I said, would you measure the cards and come up with some kind of numbers?

41:26.265 --> 41:26.865
So they did.

41:28.327 --> 41:31.632
Essentially, it came out an estimated 18 million items.

41:32.873 --> 41:34.075
18 million items.

41:34.308 --> 41:34.949
Right.

41:34.969 --> 41:40.154
But see, there's magazines, there's microphones, there's photographs.

41:41.915 --> 41:44.298
They really don't know how many photographs they have.

41:46.200 --> 41:50.844
You see, we're back to, essentially, it was a manual paper-based system.

41:51.705 --> 41:52.966
A manual, what did you call it?

41:52.986 --> 42:03.977
A manual paper-based system of trying to keep track of 18 million items and 250,000 users.

42:05.594 --> 42:06.595
And it didn't work.

42:09.379 --> 42:20.372
So when you see people throwing numbers about, I don't trust any of them because nobody knew.

42:20.392 --> 42:22.975
Or if they did, they didn't tell me.

42:22.995 --> 42:28.682
So the 200,000 figure, and that's just a figure, you know, that I've fed it.

42:28.702 --> 42:33.789
So that, in your view, is a grossly inflated figure.

42:34.790 --> 42:35.010
Right.

42:35.547 --> 42:43.635
My view is an inaccurate number, and I think he has no basis for it.

42:43.656 --> 42:45.517
What would you think is a more reasonable number?

42:46.038 --> 42:48.360
I don't know, okay?

42:48.380 --> 42:50.503
Because I didn't count the books or the cards.

42:52.164 --> 42:54.407
And there were no records of what was discarded.

42:55.148 --> 42:57.010
And that's a question.

42:57.090 --> 42:57.790
Why accurate?

42:57.890 --> 42:59.993
Why weren't there any records?

43:00.313 --> 43:05.098
Should I take people off the branch library reference desk to do that?

43:08.892 --> 43:10.574
That's not what the neighborhoods were saying.

43:10.614 --> 43:12.116
They wanted their branches open.

43:14.078 --> 43:16.501
And do you feel that there were too many branches?

43:16.521 --> 43:20.605
Do you think maybe some of them could be either consolidated or shut down?

43:20.685 --> 43:20.946
No.

43:21.506 --> 43:27.153
Because I know that was in the... We had two mayors suggest that when they got in deep water.

43:31.377 --> 43:37.144
So, you know, are you bitter about...

43:37.445 --> 43:40.488
You know, I mean, that's a fair question, I think, the way things turned out.

43:40.508 --> 43:41.569
No, I don't think it's fair.

43:41.609 --> 43:44.112
We're getting into personal law terms.

43:44.132 --> 43:52.580
Well, do you think you were made the scapegoat of things?

43:52.600 --> 43:53.021
I don't know.

43:53.041 --> 43:53.781
History will tell.

43:55.103 --> 44:06.574
Do you—I had a long discussion with Mr. Colter the other evening, and, you know, he seems to think that there's a labor union problem that—

44:07.499 --> 44:13.025
is more concerned about union matters than the welfare of the library.

44:13.466 --> 44:18.892
Do you think that there's merit to that position?

44:24.217 --> 44:26.280
Do you care to elaborate at all on that?

44:27.601 --> 44:35.069
Well, the union got rid of my successor, and they started working on me the day it was announced that I was coming.

44:35.089 --> 44:36.050
You mean your predecessor?

44:36.571 --> 44:37.472
My predecessor.

44:40.743 --> 44:42.025
And what do you think communion is?

44:43.066 --> 44:51.017
I can't speculate on that.

44:51.057 --> 44:56.865
Is it trying to protect their positions or create more positions?

44:57.065 --> 44:59.068
Is it economic?

44:59.609 --> 45:01.071
Probably all of the above.

45:06.358 --> 45:10.564
You know, rightly or wrongly, you are perceived as a

45:11.658 --> 45:16.003
a person who, well, I mean, you wrote a book called The Electronic Library.

45:16.164 --> 45:25.275
You know, when there's talk about the library of the future, you produced a tape called The Library of the Future.

45:26.917 --> 45:33.685
You know, the printed book really is not necessarily part of the equation, so to speak.

45:34.166 --> 45:41.395
I looked at that tape last night, and it's got the rare book room, and it's got books and magazines, and I

45:41.678 --> 45:52.270
I don't understand why people who use computers or like computers can't like books.

45:52.811 --> 45:58.017
I mean, I don't understand the mono view of the world or libraries.

46:00.760 --> 46:03.663
I think we're multidimensional institutions.

46:03.683 --> 46:07.468
I think I'm a multidimensional person.

46:07.488 --> 46:11.112
And I don't—I don't believe that the world—life is not—

46:11.547 --> 46:15.434
Life is only a zero-sum game when it comes to time for death.

46:17.598 --> 46:22.607
I think we get a lot further ahead if we look at it as creating a bigger pie.

46:23.709 --> 46:24.911
Creating a bigger what I'm saying?

46:24.931 --> 46:25.713
A bigger pie.

46:27.576 --> 46:34.669
And I think through collaboration and cooperation and those kinds of things, everybody, I think, can be win-win.

46:38.294 --> 46:41.498
But I don't understand people almost instinctively.

46:41.518 --> 46:46.104
I mean, most of the people who talk about the electronic library book haven't read it.

46:51.891 --> 46:54.875
You know, what is your vision of the future library, though?

46:55.155 --> 47:02.144
You must have a sense, clearly, having built four libraries and presided over the construction of this one.

47:02.164 --> 47:05.188
I don't know, do you want a video or a PowerPoint or what?

47:05.208 --> 47:07.170
I've got a whole box of them.

47:09.715 --> 47:16.044
I think that the library of the future will essentially be based on four different variables.

47:17.606 --> 47:20.490
I think the strongest one is community expectations.

47:23.294 --> 47:33.248
And that's getting harder to work with because communities, their expectations are much higher than they used to be.

47:33.268 --> 47:35.732
They want everything.

47:35.752 --> 47:38.355
They want fairly instant service.

47:38.435 --> 47:39.537
They want convenience.

47:39.972 --> 47:44.778
They're not as tractable as they used to be.

47:44.798 --> 47:45.919
Most of them are still nice.

47:46.940 --> 47:51.886
I'm not saying that they're just, as a society, people have a lot less patience.

47:55.049 --> 48:06.823
What I think has not come out in one of the discussions is the new library was designed after we had a benchmark public opinion poll in 1988.

48:08.609 --> 48:12.714
where we hired a professional firm to ask the community what they wanted in their library.

48:13.355 --> 48:16.198
And Susan will give you a copy of that if you would like.

48:16.719 --> 48:17.960
Susan?

48:18.481 --> 48:20.683
The archivist.

48:20.703 --> 48:21.124
She got it.

48:21.304 --> 48:21.664
I gave it.

48:22.245 --> 48:22.726
Okay.

48:22.746 --> 48:24.328
What should I ask you for again?

48:24.348 --> 48:26.871
It's a public opinion poll made in 1988.

48:27.131 --> 48:27.491
Okay.

48:29.274 --> 48:37.283
There's also another poll later done before the 1994 election, which basically reinforces

48:39.372 --> 48:41.053
the public's opinion.

48:41.073 --> 48:47.059
At the time we were designing the main library, we had 40 community focus groups.

48:49.921 --> 48:56.687
And over the process of design, we testified at the Art Commission, the Library Commission, the Board of Services.

48:56.707 --> 48:59.630
We probably had 50 different public hearings.

49:01.952 --> 49:08.097
What is leading up to my contention is I built that building based on what the people of San Francisco want.

49:11.873 --> 49:15.498
not the press, not the literary world.

49:16.520 --> 49:23.029
In fact, I'm starting to sense a lot of the backlash, if you will, is coming from sort of the literary world.

49:24.271 --> 49:26.193
About backlash, in what respect?

49:26.213 --> 49:34.084
Well, the Nicholson-Victor story, Sally up in Portland and Harper, those kinds of things.

49:34.205 --> 49:36.288
I think there's a factor there.

49:36.328 --> 49:38.691
I'm not sure I can quantify or identify.

49:39.565 --> 49:51.764
But I think that maybe the nerves are—they're either more exposed nerves to similar changes, or they're very opportunistic.

49:51.784 --> 49:59.596
So that there is a sense—I mean, I think Nicholson Baker, a very entertaining writer, but I think he's opportunistic as all to that.

50:00.898 --> 50:07.007
Opportunistic in the sense that, what, that there was an opportunity to sell a story to The New Yorker?

50:09.215 --> 50:11.397
He admits his goal in life was to be a writer.

50:12.418 --> 50:15.241
Well, my goal in life was to be a writer, too.

50:15.802 --> 50:22.589
And what he wanted to do was to write enough so that he could support himself, his wife, and his kids.

50:24.090 --> 50:25.872
But, I mean, he does very well.

50:26.012 --> 50:29.216
I mean, just for the sake of argument, he does very well writing fiction.

50:29.476 --> 50:31.078
I have no problem with it.

50:31.138 --> 50:38.125
It's just that when he takes his fiction over into nonfiction, it concerns him.

50:40.231 --> 50:45.958
And you think that really is the source of a lot of the problems here, that story?

50:46.198 --> 50:47.140
No, no, no.

50:47.160 --> 50:50.644
Well, it certainly did make it a national story.

50:50.664 --> 50:51.866
It created a lightning rod.

50:52.286 --> 50:59.595
Created a—in fact, I have another little speech, if you're interested, called— I get all the time in the world, so, you know.

50:59.836 --> 51:01.097
Yeah, I'm afraid I'll probably die.

51:01.137 --> 51:02.819
Well, tell me how interesting we do that, mentally.

51:02.879 --> 51:05.543
Because I have to go back down to San Jose in the morning.

51:05.683 --> 51:05.783
Okay.

51:08.969 --> 51:24.425
But the whole thing on writing the killer surf of the press, I think none of us was prepared for the press coverage.

51:25.326 --> 51:33.795
And I mean that in the broads, not just the papers, but television from Russia, Japan, Chile, France.

51:34.079 --> 51:38.444
Paul showed up shooting pictures, kinds of stuff, on ABC.

51:38.764 --> 51:41.768
Actually, CBS did a very nice piece.

51:41.788 --> 51:47.054
When I'm saying nice— Complementary.

51:47.354 --> 51:51.018
I see it as nice because what they said is what I believe.

51:51.639 --> 51:58.427
I mean, I didn't tell them what's right, but they show children, they show excitement, they show—that kind of thing.

51:58.447 --> 52:02.331
It's—what's his name—Charles Osgood.

52:09.297 --> 52:15.664
Anyway, so the other, I mean, was very similar.

52:16.125 --> 52:19.208
My last library, I had a full-time public relations department.

52:21.191 --> 52:24.935
San Francisco, I never got one.

52:24.955 --> 52:30.522
I took a librarian, Marcia, who you may have been, who has grooved tremendously.

52:30.542 --> 52:31.923
She was a branch librarian.

52:32.524 --> 52:33.465
She started on this.

52:34.643 --> 52:40.911
I tried to get a public relations, public information officer in the budget, and they would say, I wouldn't do that.

52:41.172 --> 52:44.436
So I just kind of went and said, okay, who thinks they want to try it?

52:45.097 --> 52:45.698
And Marsha.

52:47.540 --> 52:51.205
And she's worked real hard, and I have a lot of respect for her.

52:51.225 --> 52:54.689
But she didn't have the training in dealing with it.

52:54.709 --> 52:59.716
I was a public affairs officer in the Navy, I should point out.

52:59.736 --> 53:04.262
Anyway, so a lot of it, when this stuff hit, I mean, just...

53:05.693 --> 53:11.500
We had been working ourselves to the bone to get that place open for a year.

53:12.681 --> 53:16.566
That was seven days a week, seven nights a week, practically.

53:16.806 --> 53:22.673
Practically everyone in the administration working their ass off to get this thing done.

53:24.976 --> 53:33.186
Came down to the wire, because the contractor wasn't through at the building, and the mayor had already decided it would open on April 18th, and it did.

53:35.022 --> 53:37.065
our computer telephone text.

53:37.185 --> 53:40.889
We're working twenty-hour days for two weeks.

53:40.909 --> 53:41.670
And so we got it done.

53:41.730 --> 53:42.691
So everything was pretty fragile.

53:42.732 --> 53:48.098
So we opened it, and we come in, and there's a lot of ooh-and-ah-ing, and people like it, and they love it.

53:48.158 --> 53:50.601
And then all of a sudden, this other stuff kind of starts hitting.

53:50.621 --> 54:03.657
Well, you threw away all the books, really didn't have much shelves, some of which has validity and some truth, some of which greatly exaggerated, and a lot of it irrelevant.

54:03.677 --> 54:04.118
I mean,

54:04.688 --> 54:06.990
I knew that shelving was going to be a problem.

54:07.030 --> 54:10.534
That's why I asked for 100 shelters three years ago.

54:12.816 --> 54:18.161
That got hung up, of course, because I didn't think we could pay $15 an hour to shelve them.

54:18.181 --> 54:31.694
Well, plus the whole, you know, the shelfer was a new job category as opposed to a page, you know, and I guess that caused some disquietude, shall we say.

54:31.714 --> 54:34.577
Well, worse than that, the union fought it to a standstill.

54:35.958 --> 54:37.980
And there will be no shelters, by the way.

54:38.060 --> 54:38.561
That's right.

54:38.581 --> 54:39.943
That's history.

54:40.103 --> 54:42.886
That's history.

54:42.906 --> 54:44.468
I had no problem with that.

54:44.648 --> 54:50.675
But it's, I had a budget, and I had things I had to get done.

54:52.918 --> 54:58.684
And the good news with the Proposition E, the Charter Amendment, was the budget went up.

54:59.345 --> 55:01.267
The bad news is that was a box.

55:04.451 --> 55:05.492
So if it wasn't enough,

55:06.215 --> 55:07.457
It's called tough.

55:07.477 --> 55:09.540
I have to solve it.

55:09.560 --> 55:11.422
Because no one was going to give me any more money.

55:13.145 --> 55:13.846
And that's fair.

55:15.288 --> 55:20.556
But they should also have given me the authority to solve the problems.

55:20.576 --> 55:25.042
Going back, did you ever input into the design how it looks?

55:25.062 --> 55:25.443
Very much.

55:26.784 --> 55:29.388
Do you think that maybe there's too much open space in there?

55:29.428 --> 55:29.608
No.

55:30.390 --> 55:32.873
That there could be more shelves incorporated in that?

55:33.935 --> 55:35.597
Sure, but not significantly.

55:37.619 --> 55:40.104
I mean, if you want a book warehouse, we could have done that.

55:41.426 --> 55:43.491
It would have been ugly.

55:43.511 --> 55:46.136
Have you ever been in the Madison Building in Washington, D.C.?

55:46.376 --> 55:48.821
I have, but there's been a lot of books in there.

55:49.502 --> 55:54.692
I know, but do you like to spend a lot of time in there?

55:54.713 --> 55:58.119
Do you see it as a community center or a communication center?

55:58.139 --> 55:59.702
But that's not its function.

55:59.722 --> 56:00.083
I know.

56:00.822 --> 56:02.624
but I think the building gap.

56:03.005 --> 56:06.489
Well, tell me then, give me your definition of what a library is.

56:06.589 --> 56:07.651
I think that's very important.

56:07.851 --> 56:17.203
You're a professional librarian who's built four libraries, a major city, certainly a cutting-edge library, and a public library.

56:17.443 --> 56:19.466
What is a library?

56:19.486 --> 56:28.838
Well, I spent two years with Mr. Coulter and the commission defining the mission statement, which the commission adopted and the board of supervisors adopted them.

56:30.809 --> 56:45.142
It's to provide access to the citizens of San Francisco to information, knowledge, the joys of reading, and lifelong learning.

56:45.162 --> 56:46.563
I think the Maine Library does that.

56:48.785 --> 56:50.767
Three times as much as the old one did.

56:56.252 --> 57:00.276
And you said it's a community center, too, so clearly aesthetics are

57:00.965 --> 57:07.817
I mean, do you think they really had that discussion when they built the city hall?

57:08.799 --> 57:10.462
Had what discussion?

57:10.482 --> 57:11.825
How much space they wasted?

57:12.185 --> 57:15.171
They should have just built a square building with bureaucrats' offices.

57:17.094 --> 57:25.369
Well, you know, but they don't have to store two million books or a million books either, you know, and project for the future, too.

57:26.328 --> 57:33.755
I had no plans to put every book for the rest of the library's history in that building.

57:34.736 --> 57:35.537
It makes no sense.

57:41.042 --> 57:52.033
There's a quote that has been attributed to you, that the earthquake of 89 gave an opportunity to, quote, clean the Argyne stables.

57:52.113 --> 57:53.695
Is that an accurate quote?

57:53.715 --> 57:55.997
Did you make that statement?

57:56.652 --> 57:57.013
No.

57:57.934 --> 58:01.219
The statement was made by the columnist Bill Mandel in 1987.

58:01.239 --> 58:06.627
And he said that.

58:06.647 --> 58:07.709
I quoted him once.

58:07.989 --> 58:10.093
Okay.

58:10.113 --> 58:12.076
But he said that.

58:12.216 --> 58:13.878
But did you subscribe to it?

58:14.199 --> 58:19.447
Was it an opportunity to get rid of a lot of the sweeping, so to speak, you know?

58:20.288 --> 58:22.812
Well, you have a half million books on the floor.

58:24.158 --> 58:27.642
Every building is shut down for structural reassessment.

58:29.504 --> 58:32.026
We already had the building planned for the new building.

58:33.989 --> 58:43.098
It seemed like the rational approach was to start moving the collections to where they would be in the new building, rather than just sticking them back where they were.

58:46.442 --> 58:51.027
So with a half a million books on the floor, maybe it is an opportunity to

58:51.800 --> 58:57.308
to accelerate the process, I guess.

58:57.468 --> 58:58.530
Fair statement, I guess.

58:58.830 --> 58:58.970
Right.

58:59.351 --> 59:16.275
I mean, part of it, but it was a little more complicated than that, because most of the books on the floor were in the stack block, the seven-story stack block, which no library in this country will ever build again.

59:18.018 --> 59:21.182
It turned out to be a tremendous chimney in Los Angeles, and

59:21.449 --> 59:27.115
would have killed people in San Francisco if there had been anybody in the stacks.

59:27.135 --> 59:39.088
Fortunately, it was a beautiful October day, and I was at the World Series, along with a lot of people, and since it was open in San Francisco, the city was essentially shut down.

59:39.148 --> 59:41.671
There was only one person in the stack block.

59:44.915 --> 59:49.920
When I went in there the next morning with a hard hat, there were jagged

59:50.440 --> 59:54.945
pieces of glass, because a lot of the floors were glass, so the light would come through.

59:56.807 --> 01:00:03.634
And there were jagged edges coming down three feet down, and the ceiling was only six and a half feet high anyway.

01:00:04.996 --> 01:00:09.220
If there had been people in the middle of that, they would have been killed.

01:00:10.742 --> 01:00:14.406
And I remember that vividly.

01:00:15.263 --> 01:00:26.498
The building actually performed well, but because the stack block had its own momentum—I mean, that's a heavy sucker, because it's all integrated, full of a million books—it pulled off from the walls.

01:00:27.038 --> 01:00:34.448
Anyway, they should have never let the public know stacks in the first place.

01:00:34.468 --> 01:00:42.739
The building was designed in 1917 by Carnegie's architects, based on the philosophy of nineteenth-century librarians.

01:00:43.951 --> 01:00:49.680
which was that the purpose of libraries was to essentially be a book warehouse.

01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:51.943
The public came there to use them.

01:00:53.826 --> 01:00:56.630
The circulation was a secondary function.

01:00:57.171 --> 01:00:58.453
It used to be in the old libraries.

01:00:58.934 --> 01:01:00.816
When it opened, it was in a little alcove.

01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:08.288
The periodical room wasn't much bigger than this living room.

01:01:08.308 --> 01:01:09.469
It had the stack block.

01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:11.152
You put stacks in there.

01:01:11.172 --> 01:01:12.234
You had reading rooms.

01:01:12.254 --> 01:01:13.215
You had reference desks.

01:01:14.107 --> 01:01:16.350
And you had people retrieve the books out of the stacks.

01:01:17.251 --> 01:01:19.114
So you probably paid them 12 cents an hour.

01:01:21.116 --> 01:01:24.921
Well, over the decades, functions changed.

01:01:26.323 --> 01:01:30.789
Libraries got into outreach, got into all the different formats.

01:01:30.809 --> 01:01:36.496
In the 60s, for whatever reason, and it took me a long time to kind of run it down, but there is a paper.

01:01:36.557 --> 01:01:39.220
Susan probably has it in the archives now.

01:01:40.685 --> 01:02:08.920
where one of the library administrators wrote a paper saying that the goal for the San Francisco Public Library should be to be

01:02:10.486 --> 01:02:16.152
and essentially tried to use that building in ways it was never designed to function.

01:02:18.914 --> 01:02:23.519
So, back to the earthquake.

01:02:23.539 --> 01:02:38.854
It made no sense to me to perpetuate the problems that had been there for thirty years.

01:02:40.376 --> 01:02:40.476
Okay.

01:02:40.793 --> 01:02:42.985
How about the consolidation of subjects?

01:02:43.106 --> 01:02:47.530
I mean, there was a humanity section and there was a geography section.
