00:01.972 --> 00:02.653
Welcome back.

00:02.713 --> 00:04.615
I'm Lynn Neary, sitting in for Diane Rehm.

00:05.035 --> 00:07.317
My guest this hour is Nicholas Bazbanes.

00:07.337 --> 00:13.003
He's the author of Patience and Fortitude, a roving chronicle of book people, book places, and book culture.

00:13.724 --> 00:27.398
I wanted to ask you to react to a quote that was in the book from Robert Taylor of Hampshire College, who was prescient, I guess you would say, about the effect that technology would have on libraries.

00:27.418 --> 00:29.380
He wrote this in 1967.

00:29.360 --> 00:36.092
And he said the word library carries too many connotations, which may not let the library get to tomorrow.

00:36.132 --> 00:39.639
The term exaggerates the difference between print and other media.

00:39.659 --> 00:43.365
It emphasizes the warehouse rather than the dynamic process.

00:43.826 --> 00:47.914
And he is somebody who at that time argued against having too many books in the library.

00:48.595 --> 00:48.735
Uh-huh.

00:48.715 --> 00:52.018
I'm sorry, I thank you so much for bringing up that particular episode.

00:52.038 --> 01:01.647
That is really one of the little lone episodes in the development of college and university libraries that I came across and that I write about in Patience and Fortitude.

01:02.668 --> 01:13.238
And Taylor did make that statement in print in 1967, and it was right when Hampshire College, which is a little liberal arts college in western Massachusetts, was being established.

01:13.859 --> 01:16.461
Hampshire is a very fascinating little example.

01:16.981 --> 01:29.410
Hampshire College was founded by the faculties, by the faculties and administrators of Mount Holyoke College, Smith College, Amherst College, and University of Massachusetts, all of which are within 10 or 15 miles of each other.

01:29.430 --> 01:35.344
And they wanted to do an experimental institution, do the kinds of things that they weren't really doing on their own campuses.

01:35.662 --> 01:38.947
And they also then wanted to develop a new kind of a library.

01:38.987 --> 01:40.370
Now, of course, this is the 60s.

01:40.430 --> 01:41.191
There were computers.

01:41.712 --> 01:44.236
But we're not talking about the Internet at that point.

01:44.316 --> 01:46.519
We're talking about all kinds of electronic things.

01:46.560 --> 01:53.390
And Taylor felt that the printed book was about to enter the margins of society.

01:53.491 --> 01:59.340
I interviewed Taylor to make this brief 30 years later.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.503
Hampshire is now building a larger library.

02:01.703 --> 02:06.189
And what made this work, by the way, was the five college consortium that they had out there.

02:06.690 --> 02:15.261
Hampshire would build a library that would contain perhaps 100,000 books, but they could borrow freely from Amherst, Smith, Mount Holyoke, and UMass.

02:15.562 --> 02:19.527
And what they found out is that thousands more books come into Hampshire than go out.

02:19.867 --> 02:21.850
The students do require their books.

02:21.890 --> 02:22.731
They want their books.

02:23.152 --> 02:24.754
They're now building a much larger library.

02:25.207 --> 02:26.969
a library at Hampshire College.

02:26.989 --> 02:28.951
They've established out there a center for the book.

02:29.572 --> 02:31.634
They are now some pro-printed book.

02:32.155 --> 02:32.735
It's amazing.

02:32.775 --> 02:37.661
And Taylor, I asked him, I said, I read that quote to him, and I quote him in the book here.

02:37.961 --> 02:39.503
He said, well, I guess I was pretty silly.

02:39.523 --> 02:47.952
I forget the exact quote, but he's embarrassed by having, today, looking back 30 years for having predicted the end of the library as we know it.

02:48.112 --> 02:49.894
I guess he admits that he was wrong.

02:50.895 --> 02:51.536
Okay, great story.

02:52.116 --> 02:52.557
Jim in St.

02:52.577 --> 02:53.678
Louis, Missouri, hello.

02:54.080 --> 02:56.362
Hi, thank you for taking my call.

02:56.623 --> 02:58.625
A quick comment and a quick question.

02:59.145 --> 03:05.152
I recently, by a series of flukes, got on the internet and made my first internet purchase, something I've been avoiding.

03:05.792 --> 03:11.298
I have a great affection for an old 1940 film with Robert Montgomery, the Earl of Chicago.

03:11.798 --> 03:19.146
And I actually found an ex-virory book, a 1937 novel of that title by a movie director.

03:19.406 --> 03:20.087
So I would have

03:20.506 --> 03:23.409
never found that if I hadn't gone on the internet.

03:23.429 --> 03:32.497
So I suspect that many people selling things over the internet may be unwittingly or wittingly preserving books that otherwise might go by the wayside.

03:33.698 --> 03:49.652
The question I'd like to ask is, in your researches, Mr. Besmein, have you come across any information about the great Buddhist monastery and library at the University of Nalanda in Bihar, which was destroyed later by

03:49.970 --> 03:51.873
during the Muslim invasion?

03:53.395 --> 03:56.799
No, I haven't, and I'm writing it down briefly here.

03:57.140 --> 03:59.563
Perhaps you could... Could you give me a little more information?

03:59.743 --> 04:00.404
I would love to read.

04:00.424 --> 04:04.370
This is precisely the kind of thing that I'm looking for for this next book.

04:05.291 --> 04:16.587
It was supposedly constructed around 5th century A.D., which is a period in the history of Buddhism before Buddhism became more nationalistic, so to speak.

04:17.308 --> 04:18.289
And...

04:18.607 --> 04:28.639
Later, I think it was responsible for the dissemination of Buddhist teachings and Buddhist activity all over Asia.

04:28.759 --> 04:29.821
And once again, where was it?

04:30.441 --> 04:36.549
It's in Bihar and N-A-L-A-N-D-A, Nalanda.

04:36.569 --> 04:45.019
It was a great monastery, and it contained the library resources that drew people from as far away as China and

04:45.893 --> 04:50.397
You can be sure I will be... It was destroyed later during the invasion.

04:51.078 --> 04:57.064
But it seems to me to be often overlooked by us here in the West.

04:57.244 --> 05:01.648
But it was, by all accounts, an extraordinary center.

05:01.849 --> 05:02.769
Thank you for the tip.

05:02.789 --> 05:03.710
Thanks very much, Jim.

05:03.911 --> 05:05.112
You're very welcome.

05:05.132 --> 05:08.996
It's always nice to hear an author getting a tip right there on the air.

05:09.016 --> 05:11.038
I have my notebook with me at all times.

05:11.378 --> 05:12.899
George in Plantation, Florida.

05:12.919 --> 05:13.220
Hello.

05:13.640 --> 05:14.081
Hello.

05:14.481 --> 05:14.601
Hello.

05:14.885 --> 05:20.673
I wonder if the gentleman can tell us something about the wonderful library building that's still standing at Ephesus.

05:21.694 --> 05:22.235
I know St.

05:22.275 --> 05:40.040
Peter lived nearby and presumably studied there, and the greatest story I know, I've seen it several times, is that the city officials used to gather there, and they had an underground passage to the brothel across the street, and so the library was very important to them.

05:40.601 --> 05:42.343
So I wonder if you know anything about that.

05:42.475 --> 05:49.633
I actually traveled to Ephesus with this new book, pardon me, and I have a photograph that I shot of this library.

05:49.765 --> 05:52.668
It was not, by ancient standards, a great library.

05:52.688 --> 05:53.748
It was a Roman library.

05:53.789 --> 05:55.810
I think it had about 15,000 volumes.

05:56.551 --> 06:01.455
And the Austrians have rebuilt it, so not the entire library, of course, but the facade.

06:01.495 --> 06:02.556
And it is quite striking.

06:02.977 --> 06:10.703
The great library in that region that I write about, which I went to visit, is Pergamum in Turkey, not far from Ephesus.

06:10.723 --> 06:18.270
And right after I write about Alexandria in the new book, I go to Pergamum, because this was the great rival library to Alexandria.

06:18.350 --> 06:18.490
Mm-hmm.

06:18.470 --> 06:20.272
established about the same time.

06:20.892 --> 06:25.837
And it is the only library from Hellenistic times that survives in any fashion.

06:26.238 --> 06:30.842
You can actually go and walk in the old reading rooms and not get goose pimples just thinking about it.

06:30.862 --> 06:34.726
And so I do write about that library, which existed for 150 years.

06:35.367 --> 06:36.908
And the books, we know what happened to them.

06:36.968 --> 06:42.134
When Antony was courting Cleopatra, he took the 200,000 books and gave them to her as a gift.

06:42.194 --> 06:47.599
And that similarly ended what was then a great library, a great center of research.

06:47.579 --> 06:51.205
But the library at Ephesus was a private library.

06:51.265 --> 06:52.768
It was about 15,000 volumes.

06:52.828 --> 06:54.951
It came somewhat later than Pergamum.

06:55.212 --> 06:59.078
I don't write about it at any great length in the new book, but I do have a lovely photograph of it.

06:59.539 --> 06:59.840
Okay.

07:00.240 --> 07:01.443
Thanks so much for your call, George.

07:01.943 --> 07:03.446
And Libby in Tucson, Arizona.

07:03.466 --> 07:03.786
Hello.

07:04.848 --> 07:04.989
Hi.

07:05.770 --> 07:09.676
My 9-year-old daughter is named Hypatia.

07:09.897 --> 07:10.999
Oh, I love that.

07:11.199 --> 07:12.962
Actually, she's named Patia, shortened.

07:13.178 --> 07:20.565
after Hypatia, the woman, the scholar and mathematician who was the head of the Library of Alexandria and who was murdered by a Christian mob.

07:21.147 --> 07:24.319
And I wonder if your book discusses her story at all?

07:24.518 --> 07:26.600
I don't discuss her story.

07:26.660 --> 07:32.146
I do name her, but her story is one of the great stories in the tradition of Alexandria.

07:32.166 --> 07:41.136
And again, it points out how important women were in the ancient world, certainly at the Greek libraries and the Greek centers of scholarship.

07:41.156 --> 07:45.380
But she was a very notable name, and that's a wonderful name for her child, by the way.

07:45.620 --> 07:46.742
Are you a librarian, Libby?

07:47.302 --> 07:52.648
No, I'm not, but my husband's an astronomer, so that's how he became aware of her story.

07:52.848 --> 07:53.749
That's a wonderful name.

07:54.083 --> 08:04.159
I think it is an apocryphal story for today, given the religious velatry that we're experiencing.

08:04.179 --> 08:11.190
I think it teaches a moral lesson for tolerance and acceptance of people of other beliefs.

08:11.210 --> 08:18.522
Ironically, Bishop Cyril was canonized because of his role in inciting her murder.

08:18.788 --> 08:21.371
But she's not an apocryphal figure, I think we should point out.

08:21.552 --> 08:24.095
I mean, she's an actual figure, I do believe.

08:24.115 --> 08:25.277
Correct, correct.

08:25.937 --> 08:28.681
I think it's a lesson to all of us.

08:28.701 --> 08:30.403
Thanks so much for your call, Libby.

08:30.423 --> 08:34.048
I'm learning a lot here today.

08:34.108 --> 08:35.790
Let's go to Alice in Miami, Florida.

08:35.830 --> 08:36.451
Hello, Alice.

08:37.272 --> 08:37.412
Hi.

08:37.913 --> 08:39.275
What a wonderful program.

08:40.136 --> 08:46.264
One of the things I hope that men will ask women to marry them and give them victory

08:46.565 --> 08:49.068
You know, large amounts of books.

08:49.088 --> 08:50.029
I've heard that before.

08:50.069 --> 08:52.152
What a great gift.

08:52.172 --> 08:54.435
A gift of 200,000 exquisite books.

08:56.037 --> 09:06.310
You know, my question is that, you know, I know that there were a lot of African-American authors during the 60s and 70s.

09:06.931 --> 09:14.260
However, when I go to second-hand bookstores or, you know, the other agencies,

09:14.425 --> 09:17.609
that had books like Salvation Army and stuff.

09:17.629 --> 09:22.036
I don't find those books, and I was wondering if they have been thrown away.

09:22.116 --> 09:24.839
I'm trying to encourage people not to do so.

09:25.340 --> 09:28.224
And then also, what do you think happened to them?

09:28.284 --> 09:34.052
I know there were lots of those authors, and yet those books are not available.

09:34.433 --> 09:41.783
Well, I write about the person I regard as the greatest living African-American collector in Gentle Madness,

09:42.117 --> 09:56.875
a gentleman by the name of Charles Bloxham, briefly who was told when he was a youngster growing up in Pennsylvania, he asked a teacher why it is that when he reads in the history books, he never sees any mention of black people, or to use the word that was operative about Negroes.

09:56.915 --> 10:02.202
And he was told by a teacher that that is because, Charles, black people have no history.

10:02.738 --> 10:15.458
And he said, if that's the case, then how do you explain all these extraordinary stories my grandfather and my great-grandfather told me about the Underground Railroad and these marvelous stories of survival, these marvelous folktales that came over from Africa?

10:15.979 --> 10:19.745
He determined at that point that he would go out and document his heritage.

10:20.266 --> 10:23.551
The short of this story is that Blockson went to Pennsylvania State University.

10:23.651 --> 10:25.374
He was a teammate of Lenny Moore.

10:25.635 --> 10:27.818
They were roommates, Roosevelt Greer.

10:28.118 --> 10:34.169
Charles was offered a no-cut contract from the New York Giants, and after a week in the field, he walked away.

10:34.891 --> 10:40.561
Lenny Moore, I later interviewed, said we thought Charles was nuts, but then I looked back, he knew what he was doing better than anyone else.

10:41.262 --> 10:44.649
And Charles said, what I wanted to be was a black bibliophile.

10:45.250 --> 10:51.882
And the short of this story is that 80,000 or so books that Charles collected are now at Temple University.

10:52.165 --> 10:58.134
In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, it is one of the great, great collections of African-American literature and history.

10:58.514 --> 11:04.043
Here in Washington, Howard University has a marvelous collection of African-American material.

11:04.844 --> 11:06.747
Harvard University has a great collection.

11:06.807 --> 11:12.034
And, of course, the greatest of them all is the Schomburg Center in New York City, which is fabulous.

11:12.535 --> 11:13.657
Charles walked in there once.

11:13.697 --> 11:17.262
He was a great track star, and he was in New York for an event.

11:17.444 --> 11:19.427
And he said, I took the A train to Harlem.

11:19.447 --> 11:21.090
And he did the old Ellington tune.

11:21.130 --> 11:23.453
And he went up there and got off at Lenox on 125th.

11:24.555 --> 11:26.759
And that's when he walked into the Schaumburg Center.

11:26.799 --> 11:28.581
And he said, I knew I wasn't alone.

11:29.242 --> 11:30.705
I knew I had a purpose in life.

11:30.865 --> 11:33.589
And he is now considered the living Schaumburg.

11:33.810 --> 11:44.346
My teacher, she told me when I was in seventh grade, my English teacher, she said, listen, don't bother putting your energy into all of this writing.

11:44.613 --> 11:50.191
because your people do not have many authors or writers.

11:50.311 --> 11:54.825
I'm saddened to hear that, Alice, because you know and I know and we all know that that's not true.

11:54.974 --> 12:02.142
And all you have to do is to go to any of these libraries that I've just mentioned, and you will have tears in your eyes when you walk in.

12:02.162 --> 12:03.544
That was a long time ago.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.246
Thanks so much for your call, Alice.

12:05.266 --> 12:05.626
Thank you.

12:06.667 --> 12:12.934
Nicholas Basbanes is the author of Patience and Fortitude, a roving chronicle of book people, book places, and book culture.

12:12.974 --> 12:16.859
I'm Lynn Neary, and you are listening to The Diane Rehm Show.

12:16.879 --> 12:20.823
I'm going to try and get one more call in here now.

12:20.883 --> 12:22.585
Richard in Phoenix, Arizona, hello.

12:22.868 --> 12:23.309
Hello.

12:24.030 --> 12:41.605
Yes, I happen to be one of those antiquarian scholar booksellers, and what amazes me is the great university special collections librarians that understand the significance of a collection that's perhaps unique and never been put forward, and almost instantly they have the imagination to see it in context.

12:42.126 --> 12:43.088
I like your comments.

12:43.321 --> 12:47.050
I refer you to the chapter in my new book called Hunters and Gatherers.

12:47.411 --> 12:51.782
And what I try to demonstrate, there is precisely what you're suggesting right now.

12:52.203 --> 12:55.170
These great collections that are really...

12:56.062 --> 13:00.048
evolved from the perception of a bookseller, somebody who really sees the connections.

13:00.148 --> 13:14.830
A theme I also write about, which I haven't mentioned, are the Jewish emigre booksellers who escaped from Germany during the 1930s and who found refuge in North America, and who in turn knew where the books were in Europe after the war, knew where to go...

13:14.810 --> 13:19.315
to go and get them and knew which institutions in the United States would benefit greatly from them.

13:19.816 --> 13:26.043
The result is that we have materials here that are superior to the regions that they document in Europe.

13:26.063 --> 13:27.445
And I write about this in that book.

13:27.925 --> 13:44.665
I don't know if that's precisely the question that you asked, but it is the perception of antiquarian people, booksellers, who have to make a case to a curator, a librarian at an academic institution, of why this material is important and why it has to be preserved.

13:45.100 --> 13:47.965
And just finally, what's ahead for books and for libraries?

13:48.005 --> 13:49.067
So far they've survived.

13:49.127 --> 13:51.251
Are they going to survive into the third millennium?

13:51.271 --> 13:57.602
I quote the subtitle of my next book, The Permanence of Books in an Impermanent World, and I believe yes.

13:57.662 --> 13:58.864
You have great faith in that.

13:58.884 --> 14:00.186
I have abiding great faith.

14:00.246 --> 14:01.388
And how will it change?

14:01.368 --> 14:02.049
Will it change?

14:02.510 --> 14:05.295
You know, books have changed through thousands of years.

14:05.335 --> 14:06.777
I mean, they always haven't been on paper.

14:06.877 --> 14:08.460
Books have been carved on stone.

14:08.500 --> 14:10.003
They've been on clay tablets.

14:10.383 --> 14:11.666
They've been on papyrus.

14:11.706 --> 14:13.048
