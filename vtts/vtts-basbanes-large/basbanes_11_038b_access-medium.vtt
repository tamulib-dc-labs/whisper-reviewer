WEBVTT

00:02.849 --> 00:07.254
Have you been here 30 years?

00:07.474 --> 00:11.419
This particular facility is 24 years old, I guess, right?

00:11.439 --> 00:12.280
Something like that.

00:12.600 --> 00:17.265
How long has the university been actively collecting special collections?

00:17.406 --> 00:20.189
The material that we see in this library.

00:20.369 --> 00:28.418
Okay, everything here can't be before 1890 because on February 14, 1890,

00:28.870 --> 00:32.255
The library was then located in University College.

00:32.416 --> 00:37.464
University College burned to the ground on February 14, 1890.

00:38.645 --> 00:43.914
So everything since then, a few things were rescued and a few things were out on low.

00:43.974 --> 00:45.837
Any really important things destroyed?

00:47.139 --> 00:50.885
Well, our Audubon, for starters.

00:50.905 --> 00:53.629
Do you have all five volumes of it?

00:54.098 --> 00:55.161
We don't have it at all.

00:55.541 --> 00:56.384
Did you have it?

00:56.404 --> 00:56.945
Oh, yeah.

00:56.965 --> 00:58.108
It was complete, yeah.

00:58.128 --> 00:58.709
Sure.

00:58.729 --> 01:00.072
So there's still one in Toronto.

01:00.133 --> 01:04.603
The Metro has one, although they're threatening to sell it now.

01:05.305 --> 01:07.571
They find that money's so seductive, don't they?

01:07.631 --> 01:08.192
That's right.

01:08.459 --> 01:09.740
especially public libraries.

01:09.981 --> 01:12.403
That map they were going to sell up at Durham?

01:12.423 --> 01:14.646
Oh, the map of Hereford.

01:15.046 --> 01:15.807
Hereford, I'm sorry.

01:15.827 --> 01:16.688
The map of Mundy.

01:16.768 --> 01:19.691
I can tell you a long, scabrous story about that.

01:19.771 --> 01:20.612
What happened finally?

01:20.632 --> 01:21.513
Did they sell it?

01:21.533 --> 01:22.114
Oh, no, they saved it.

01:22.354 --> 01:23.415
They did save it.

01:23.555 --> 01:24.316
Back in Hereford.

01:24.376 --> 01:25.958
Good, yeah.

01:25.978 --> 01:31.804
But the... I just found that on the internet the other night, just going through, believe it or not.

01:32.044 --> 01:37.470
What happened here is that they start a campaign to replace the library.

01:38.024 --> 01:52.239
So there's one little irony that I think you could say by, that was 1890, by 1900, within 10 years, and maybe even sooner, the collection actually was stronger than it had been before.

01:52.640 --> 01:53.280
How did that happen?

01:53.300 --> 02:07.896
That happened because of the response in particularly Britain and Germany, to some extent locally, and to some extent the United States, but there was a lot of stuff sent.

02:08.129 --> 02:11.535
And places sent what they considered their duplicates.

02:11.575 --> 02:18.387
So the Birmingham Public Library sent us Piranesi's Opera Barry in original boards.

02:18.407 --> 02:20.571
This is 1890.

02:20.591 --> 02:22.134
Probably about 1892 or so.

02:22.655 --> 02:23.777
Just a hundred years or so.

02:23.937 --> 02:27.083
And we were given extraordinary things.

02:27.434 --> 02:29.457
But there was no Special Collections then.

02:29.517 --> 02:30.498
There was an art cupboard.

02:30.558 --> 02:36.046
The Special Collections Department was— The whole concept came in later than that, right?

02:36.086 --> 02:36.767
Oh, sure.

02:37.148 --> 02:42.135
In 1955 is when the Special Collections Department was founded, and they hired someone to run it.

02:42.195 --> 02:45.420
Her name was Marian Brown, and I succeeded her.

02:45.540 --> 02:50.848
So most of the stuff has really come in under your stewardship, I would say.

02:50.868 --> 02:51.889
A lot of it has, yeah.

02:53.911 --> 02:59.198
Have you had a focus, or is it just something that's defined by you?

03:00.280 --> 03:04.285
We build on strength, but branch off into it.

03:04.305 --> 03:08.391
In the great days of the 60s and early 70s, we would buy collections.

03:08.611 --> 03:14.900
We'd buy, say, a Hobbes collection or a Darwin collection, then use that as a basis and build on it.

03:18.065 --> 03:19.106
And you can't do that anymore?

03:19.747 --> 03:22.210
Well, we don't very often buy collections.

03:22.230 --> 03:23.412
We're sometimes given them.

03:23.628 --> 03:26.371
quite often given them.

03:26.391 --> 03:30.135
Is it because the money isn't available?

03:30.375 --> 03:32.117
Well, I'll give you an example.

03:32.658 --> 03:35.361
Now, I think this might even be part of that law.

03:36.562 --> 03:51.559
In 1972, we bought eight books from J. Satan, and those eight books included 1478 Aristotle, the Hooke's Micrographia, 1645 or whatever it is,

03:52.045 --> 03:59.217
The second edition of Boyle, Skeptical Chemist, books like that, eight of them.

03:59.257 --> 04:09.533
The bill was $10,650, American, U.S., but in 1972, the Canadian dollar was worth more than the U.S.

04:09.553 --> 04:09.834
dollar.

04:10.334 --> 04:15.222
I remember American dealers were very happy to have Canadian checks.

04:16.104 --> 04:19.369
And then larger.

04:20.395 --> 04:32.345
I reckon now, I did a little calculation for this paper that I gave in Australia at ANU last November, that you could find all those books now.

04:33.306 --> 04:37.270
You'd have to spend a week or two finding them, but you could find them.

04:38.451 --> 04:43.936
They would now cost between 40 and 50 times what they cost there.

04:44.376 --> 04:44.836
Eight books?

04:45.437 --> 04:46.318
Eight books.

04:46.338 --> 04:48.900
That just happens to be this one block that I

04:50.011 --> 04:53.619
That was 1972.

04:53.639 --> 04:54.441
1972.

04:57.348 --> 04:59.754
Too bad you can't convert that into stocks.

04:59.794 --> 05:01.057
That's right.

05:03.161 --> 05:09.015
So you can see the stuff that was in the stocks, and it's been transferred, the stuff that's falling apart.

05:09.552 --> 05:15.762
Have you ever gone out into general collections to identify things that more properly belong in special collections?

05:15.782 --> 05:16.764
I used to do that all the time.

05:16.944 --> 05:19.789
I used to go into both science and medicine and robots.

05:19.809 --> 05:25.137
I still do it in robots a bit, but I just don't have time to do it very much.

05:25.378 --> 05:26.800
You said building on strength.

05:26.860 --> 05:30.025
Is that basically your general philosophy of collecting?

05:30.646 --> 05:35.972
But if we get the opportunity... And the strengths being what, to recap them?

05:36.272 --> 05:57.615
Well, there's lots of different strengths, but in a general sense, well, English literature post-restoration, although we do have a big Shakespeare collection, history of science, history of medicine, Canadiana, French 18th century...

05:58.152 --> 06:21.291
uh material particularly the fetal soft we have special collections of voltaire and the soap but there's lots of others i mean we have the university for instance uh we had a chance several years ago to acquire a collection of australiana and there is no south pacific studies institute or anything here at the

06:21.457 --> 06:26.447
You're anticipating a question, whether you feel you have to support the career.

06:26.567 --> 06:27.149
Well, we do.

06:27.449 --> 06:28.692
But you don't have to.

06:28.772 --> 06:34.524
You don't feel that your hands are tied by what's being taught in any particular semester.

06:34.544 --> 06:35.706
Not at all.

06:36.347 --> 06:43.161
The Australian stuff does get used to a certain extent, but more importantly, it will get used when they set up.

06:43.799 --> 06:45.642
something in South Pacific Studies.

06:46.823 --> 06:48.286
Well, that's very important.

06:48.306 --> 06:49.467
I think it is.

06:50.769 --> 07:01.545
But you have people who say, well, they generally can't get stuff for special collections unless it supports the curriculum.

07:02.006 --> 07:05.411
You don't feel that you have that kind of a restriction, right?

07:06.673 --> 07:10.278
Is that your own philosophy or the philosophy of the university?

07:10.539 --> 07:11.460
Well, they accept that.

07:11.845 --> 07:13.970
I mean, I don't go and ask them.

07:14.611 --> 07:29.584
If I went to the province and said, okay, in terms of building collections, are you absolutely comfortable with letting me define what gets acquired?

07:29.817 --> 07:31.879
he would probably say, no, I'm not.

07:32.039 --> 07:33.320
So don't invite them.

07:33.340 --> 07:34.261
You don't ask.

07:35.182 --> 07:40.546
You don't ask questions where you already know what the answers can be.

07:40.847 --> 07:43.189
And, you know, don't fix it, right?

07:45.471 --> 07:55.179
Can you think of any instances, other than that one you just mentioned, where you actually have acquired things with the expectation that it will be useful down the road.

07:55.319 --> 07:57.481
Can you think of anything else?

07:57.782 --> 07:58.222
Sure.

07:58.402 --> 07:59.503
The newbie collections.

07:59.956 --> 08:02.779
N-E-W-E-Y.

08:02.839 --> 08:08.284
No reason you should ever have heard him of Tawley, but a 19th century, mid-19th century publisher.

08:08.304 --> 08:08.965
His first name?

08:09.625 --> 08:11.207
Thomas Cautley.

08:11.227 --> 08:12.007
Okay.

08:12.027 --> 08:15.030
Cautley, spelled C-A-U-T-L-E-Y.

08:15.891 --> 08:27.482
He was the name known to people only because he published the first edition of The McDermott's of Ballyclaren, which is Tawley's first novel and a legendary rarity.

08:28.255 --> 08:38.467
And he published the first edition of Wuthering Heights, also a legendary rarity, although you can see both of them at Princeton in original clock.

08:38.928 --> 08:51.764
I got interested in him because he's dismissed normally in a line or two in 19th century publishing history as kind of a vanity publisher and little more than a cook.

08:52.505 --> 08:54.547
Except he stayed in business for 40 years.

08:54.647 --> 08:57.030
He published an immense variety of stuff.

08:57.517 --> 09:02.201
So I decided it'd be interesting to put together an imprint collection for this guy.

09:02.262 --> 09:04.664
So I did.

09:04.824 --> 09:07.146
And the rationale being what?

09:07.346 --> 09:14.954
Well, you could do research on 19th century publishing history from this collection.

09:14.974 --> 09:18.597
There are no records of newbies anywhere that I know of.

09:18.657 --> 09:20.779
You've got to extrapolate from the stuff.

09:20.799 --> 09:25.143
So this is an archive waiting for a scholar, right?

09:25.163 --> 09:25.424
That's right.

09:25.484 --> 09:26.865
Well, I've done some work on it.

09:28.381 --> 09:30.424
But that's okay to have things.

09:30.464 --> 09:34.010
That's what attracts scholars, isn't it?

09:38.436 --> 09:40.259
Here's the modern lit.

09:40.279 --> 09:42.843
Well, this again, this is B10.

09:43.604 --> 09:49.353
That's the Ptolemy, Geographia, 1561.

09:49.493 --> 09:56.143
I think this is the one with the map of North America.

09:58.688 --> 10:08.984
I think this is the first Buscelli map of North America that's in this book.

10:09.004 --> 10:09.605
Pretty nice.

10:11.949 --> 10:12.269
Yeah.

10:12.349 --> 10:13.471
We make these boxes.

10:18.839 --> 10:23.847
You still have funniest place?

10:24.288 --> 10:24.929
No.

10:24.949 --> 10:25.590
So what happened?

10:27.410 --> 10:41.564
These are backfiled catalogs, and we used to do these pretty minimal things, but recently we've... There's Marie's catalog.

10:42.966 --> 10:46.209
Thank you.

10:46.830 --> 10:53.556
Well, that's wonderful.

10:53.717 --> 10:54.177
Thank you.

10:55.135 --> 10:59.421
You're talking about a bias that Americans allegedly have against them.

10:59.702 --> 11:11.499
Well, I had a hard time convincing Marie's father, who just recently died, who's a doctor in Philadelphia, that Toronto is in the same time zone.

11:11.519 --> 11:13.042
I mean, it's off the edge of the earth.

11:13.062 --> 11:15.565
They're horrified when she's moving to Canada.

11:15.585 --> 11:20.793
There are Americans in New York who think that, you know, across the Hudson River, you know, the famous New Yorker cover.

11:20.873 --> 11:22.155
Indeed, sure.

11:22.135 --> 11:31.714
But typically Americans either know absolutely nothing about Canada or they think it's just not part of the United States.

11:31.734 --> 11:33.478
Or they think it's part of it.

11:33.799 --> 11:33.999
Sure.

11:34.079 --> 11:36.444
Well, this is a more prevalent view in the West.

11:36.464 --> 11:38.648
You see, B.C.

11:38.708 --> 11:41.494
is actually more separatist than Quebec.

11:42.301 --> 11:44.344
In a real way, sure.

11:44.464 --> 11:49.691
There's lots of talk out there about joining up with Washington, Oregon, and California.

11:50.432 --> 11:54.277
Now, you realize, of course, that Washington and Oregon really belong to Canada.

11:54.297 --> 11:55.819
54-40 are fight.

11:55.899 --> 11:58.042
And so does Alaska.

11:58.783 --> 12:04.731
It's just the stupid fucking Brits that sold it.

12:05.133 --> 12:32.440
imagine seven million seven million dollars an election sold to alaska like they had the right to do that yeah well so uh uh you know people recognize that quebec's different you know because all those trends there but uh the rest of the country seems uh to most americans i think just to be a you know another kind of uh part probably a little bit like

12:33.010 --> 12:42.962
Hawaii or... Well, but I mean, if you do consider Canadians as almost like... There isn't any difference, you know?

12:43.143 --> 12:45.385
But Canadians are different.

12:46.327 --> 12:48.209
Quite different, I think.

12:49.891 --> 12:56.479
One of the differences is that Canadians spend half their time sitting around trying to define themselves.

12:56.619 --> 12:57.380
Americans don't.

12:57.721 --> 12:58.422
They already know.

12:58.582 --> 12:59.243
They've been told.

12:59.283 --> 13:02.747
Ever since they were knee-high, they've been told.

13:03.233 --> 13:05.336
what it means to be an American.

13:05.556 --> 13:15.809
Canadians get told if you search your soul deeply enough, you will discover what it means to be Canadian.

13:15.829 --> 13:26.963
You don't really have, you know, on the other hand, you don't have, I mean, we have so many different people from everywhere in the United States, but you don't have, I mean, you do have your French and you have your

13:27.365 --> 13:28.887
Well, we have them from everywhere.

13:29.348 --> 13:32.352
But, I mean, do you have the same multicultural... Oh, yeah.

13:32.372 --> 13:36.357
Oh, much more... ...correctness concerns up here that we... Well, sure.

13:36.417 --> 13:40.062
Maybe not quite as extreme, but pretty close.

13:40.883 --> 13:50.115
But there is a real, I think, you know, this cliché, sociological cliché, about the difference between the melting pot and the mosaic.

13:50.399 --> 13:51.280
And the U.S.

13:51.300 --> 13:52.362
is the melting pot.

13:52.482 --> 14:02.375
The minute you come, when they change your name at Ellis Island, you're American, and you become American very fast.

14:03.457 --> 14:07.562
Maybe not quite so much now, but certainly that was true.

14:08.043 --> 14:13.470
Whereas in Canada, the mosaic was that you retained the cultural...

14:15.138 --> 14:18.303
baggage that you've carried over.

14:18.424 --> 14:19.565
Well, sure, sure.

14:19.946 --> 14:36.454
In 1759, if the Brits had said, okay, bugger the French, you're not Catholic anymore, get rid of those priests, you're going to speak English, we conquered you.

14:36.805 --> 14:42.974
They gave them the Quebec Act ever since.

14:43.054 --> 14:49.464
Now, you see, Canada's version of a civil war is that you sit down at a table and argue for 200 years.

14:50.485 --> 14:55.352
It's terminally boring, but at least nobody gets killed.

14:55.713 --> 14:59.438
So we have a constitution.

14:59.579 --> 15:01.041
Yeah, but nobody shot anyone.

15:01.862 --> 15:05.327
I mean, compare it to Bosnia.

15:06.404 --> 15:32.901
We, in our polite, self-effacing way, sit down and talk, blather on interminably about constitutional rights, about sovereignty, about bilingualism, biculturalism, multiculturalism,

15:33.337 --> 15:47.278
uh you know how this affects the school system and blah blah blah blah blah but you know where i grew up uh on christmas day when the king came on the radio you stood at attention

15:48.845 --> 15:54.757
Go back to that Japanese thing you were talking about, and that started through a digital discussion.

15:56.140 --> 15:59.827
Could you just kind of go over to me what we were talking about out there?

16:00.288 --> 16:09.587
Well, the Japanese apparently have a system whereby individual faculty members are able to order books from their institutions.

16:09.567 --> 16:10.689
Through the library.

16:11.530 --> 16:15.217
We're talking about Japanese institutions.

16:15.237 --> 16:16.639
Name a couple, for example.

16:17.060 --> 16:21.267
Well, the University of Tokyo, which is the elite.

16:21.287 --> 16:26.817
In Japan, there's 600 universities, and there's both public and private.

16:27.218 --> 16:33.468
And unlike the United States, the prestigious ones, the most prestigious ones, are the public ones.

16:33.909 --> 16:37.815
And Tokyo University is, you know, miles above everything else.

16:37.835 --> 16:38.717
No kidding.

16:38.877 --> 16:40.479
It's just an inversion of everything else.

16:40.499 --> 16:54.542
To get into, if you can get into Tokyo, the University of Tokyo, or there are a couple of other examples, then you're guaranteed, or at least, now Japan's changing, but...

16:54.775 --> 16:55.957
This certainly was true.

16:56.037 --> 17:06.615
You were guaranteed middle management leading to upper management, cradle to grave, that whole Japanese system.

17:06.975 --> 17:14.788
The competition to get in is why the teenage suicide rate in Japan is higher than anywhere in the world.

17:14.808 --> 17:16.090
It's so hard to get in.

17:16.912 --> 17:20.057
Contrast that with Meisei University.

17:20.645 --> 17:23.429
which is owned by Mr. Kodama.

17:23.469 --> 17:24.930
Who's quite a collector in his own way.

17:24.950 --> 17:26.432
He's got nine first folios.

17:27.353 --> 17:30.918
He has the second largest collection of first folios in the world.

17:30.958 --> 17:33.521
And his collection of Lincoln is supposed to be outstanding.

17:33.601 --> 17:34.723
I've seen it, yeah.

17:34.763 --> 17:41.531
He's got everything from cigar store Indians to, you know, the draft of the Gettysburg Address.

17:41.551 --> 17:42.913
I can afford a trip to Japan.

17:43.013 --> 17:44.675
It's fascinating.

17:45.216 --> 17:45.977
Fascinating.

17:46.379 --> 17:49.802
But he's got great works in the history of science.

17:49.942 --> 17:55.688
I was actually taken out there to, may say... And he owns this university, right?

17:55.728 --> 17:57.169
He's the president and owner.

17:57.890 --> 18:01.873
His brother also collects... Does he collect to support his institution?

18:01.993 --> 18:09.240
Yeah, he collects to make his institution prestigious so that it can compete with Tokyo.

18:10.762 --> 18:12.844
I mean, ultimately, that's... That's a hell of a story.

18:12.864 --> 18:14.445
That's what... Sure it is.

18:14.645 --> 18:15.907
It's a great story.

18:17.068 --> 18:18.970
He's a story-driven, by the way.

18:19.251 --> 18:20.592
I've noticed that, yes.

18:20.953 --> 18:25.919
I had that impression from reading your book.

18:26.700 --> 18:30.284
At some other point, I'll tell you what I think's wrong with your book.

18:30.304 --> 18:33.168
I'd love to hear it, because I'm writing another one.

18:34.589 --> 18:37.753
No, he's quite affable.

18:38.614 --> 18:43.200
Hardly speaks English, or maybe he doesn't bother, but you get...

18:43.501 --> 18:48.706
I mean, we were driven in Mercedes and so on, on the toll road.

18:49.506 --> 18:52.429
He likes publicity.

18:52.689 --> 19:05.561
I mean, this is the man who bought the first folio that belonged to Arthur Houghton and reproduced it in facsimile so he could write an introduction.

19:05.581 --> 19:06.722
I'll show it to you.

19:06.762 --> 19:08.564
They give you books in Japan.

19:08.584 --> 19:09.385
I would just write him.

19:09.825 --> 19:10.926
How would I get in touch with him?

19:11.868 --> 19:18.518
I have the address of Mesa University because they gave me all this stuff.

19:18.538 --> 19:20.922
And you're going to give me a guy at the British Library.

19:20.942 --> 19:22.544
Yeah, Mike Crump.

19:23.646 --> 19:24.307
Remind me.

19:24.968 --> 19:30.877
But it's an amazing place.

19:31.057 --> 19:33.220
How many students approximately?

19:33.381 --> 19:35.023
Is it a good university?

19:36.016 --> 19:49.131
I have no idea, because the impression they gave me was that it was right up there with Hokkaido and so on, but I don't know if that's true or not.

19:49.151 --> 19:55.979
But he deals mainly with Mr. Nita, with Yishoto.

19:56.840 --> 19:57.561
He's a bookseller.

19:57.921 --> 19:58.462
What's his name?

19:58.883 --> 20:01.045
Nita, N-I-T-T-A.

20:01.430 --> 20:06.535
You go into his office, the first thing you see is this huge photograph of Jake Staten.

20:06.955 --> 20:10.878
And right beside him, there's a huge photograph of Warren Howell.

20:10.898 --> 20:18.305
Now, to see Nita, who's about this tall, and Warren together, I've seen photographs.

20:18.445 --> 20:19.506
It's very funny.

20:20.267 --> 20:29.395
But Nita worked for the University Microfilms by Eugene Power.

20:29.780 --> 20:37.012
He came to the United States, and he worked, I guess, in the 50s for Eugene Powell.

20:38.033 --> 20:39.696
He's a very interesting man.

20:39.716 --> 20:45.866
I was invited to speak to the Grolier Club of Japan.

20:46.587 --> 20:48.731
I said, the Grolier Club of Japan?

20:48.751 --> 20:49.973
I've never heard of the Grolier Club of Japan.

20:49.993 --> 20:50.834
That's the name, right?

20:50.854 --> 20:50.954
Yeah.

20:51.255 --> 20:54.080
Then it turned out the meeting was at a private club.

20:54.100 --> 20:56.243
There were two of us, a guy, Ian Wilson.

20:56.560 --> 21:12.291
who's a guy who was then at the British Library, now retired, and me, were asked to speak to an afternoon meeting in a private club, and the private club was in a hotel, to the Goyer Club of Japan.

21:12.391 --> 21:14.215
So I said,

21:14.600 --> 21:16.402
You know, what's the goal of your coverage?

21:16.642 --> 21:17.142
Pano.

21:17.803 --> 21:21.006
It's a very exclusive book collecting group.

21:21.026 --> 21:23.688
Did they call themselves the Granger?

21:23.708 --> 21:23.888
Mm-hmm.

21:23.908 --> 21:28.412
Shamelessly... Well, no, they claimed that he said they had permission and everything.

21:29.213 --> 21:34.878
And what it turned out to be was a group of Nita's customers.

21:36.439 --> 21:39.982
So we gave our little show, and we had simultaneous translation.

21:40.063 --> 21:42.885
I mean, these wonderfully cute little girls

21:43.118 --> 21:47.784
We translate as you go along, kind of phrase by phrase.

21:48.545 --> 21:58.478
And I lathered on about something and they all sat there drinking their iced coffee and nodding and so on.

21:58.498 --> 22:04.185
And when I got back, I said to Bob Nykirk, do you know about the Groyer Club of Japan?

22:04.205 --> 22:06.608
He said, what?

22:07.209 --> 22:09.212
The Groyer Club of Japan?

22:09.772 --> 22:11.134
I said, you don't need a...

22:12.093 --> 22:17.681
decided to have a little group of his customers involved at the Warrior Club of Japan.

22:17.781 --> 22:20.665
So let's go back to where we were about Japan.

22:20.705 --> 22:25.612
Well, these institutions compete with each other in one of the ways.

22:25.653 --> 22:27.675
They do, I guess, in two ways.

22:27.736 --> 22:32.262
The prestige of their faculty, who they can get to teach at them.

22:32.596 --> 22:41.564
the prestige of their students, what kind of entrance level requirements there are, but mainly, I think, the prestige of their collections.

22:41.925 --> 22:43.366
What kind of stuff do they have?

22:43.486 --> 22:48.711
And that's defined in a lot of ways by what Western stuff they have.

22:48.731 --> 23:00.882
So they like Shakespeare, they like the Bible, Milton, but they also like Adam Smith, David Hume, John Stuart Mill,

23:01.300 --> 23:05.044
We're talking here about, you know, Persevisions.

23:05.104 --> 23:06.045
Yeah, that's right.

23:06.226 --> 23:08.688
Yeah, major collections with manuscript stuff.

23:08.708 --> 23:10.110
They love children's books.

23:11.151 --> 23:18.279
I mean, they did, the Osborn did deals for facsimile series with the Japanese that were incredible.

23:19.320 --> 23:23.966
And they liked doing big exhibitions and so on.

23:24.266 --> 23:26.589
Now, of course, they care about Japanese stuff.

23:27.690 --> 23:30.413
Why are Western books so low to Western books?

23:30.916 --> 23:31.557
I don't know.

23:31.857 --> 23:33.178
Why is baseball so important?

23:33.238 --> 23:33.619
Indeed.

23:34.219 --> 23:38.023
Why are steaks and whiskey getting important?

23:38.043 --> 23:41.246
We were fed at lunch Kobe beef.

23:41.606 --> 23:44.128
That's what I've had.

23:44.149 --> 23:46.271
I was over there in my aircraft carrier.

23:47.131 --> 23:52.156
And we were sure all of scotch you could drink.

23:53.778 --> 23:58.442
I mean, you can buy scotch from vending machines, battles of it.

23:58.743 --> 24:02.187
See, the great thing about Tokyo is safest city in the world.

24:02.207 --> 24:03.849
You can walk around four in the morning.

24:04.450 --> 24:06.132
Every public telephone works.

24:07.273 --> 24:14.401
I never saw a... Imagine if you put whiskey in a vending machine on Fifth Avenue.

24:16.584 --> 24:17.985
I never saw anything.

24:18.506 --> 24:27.096
Women can wander around alone because physical violence, personal physical violence, is the most shameful thing you can do.

24:27.768 --> 24:35.700
So they have gangs, and they have labor assassinations, and that kind of stuff's okay.

24:36.080 --> 24:37.682
They have guest attacks.

24:38.904 --> 24:45.273
Yeah, but see, that's an organized kind of... And it is an aberration, too.

24:45.414 --> 24:47.016
That's right.

24:47.517 --> 24:50.221
But personal violence.

24:50.581 --> 24:53.505
I saw the statistics.

24:53.525 --> 24:55.969
The number of people killed by handgun in Tokyo is...

24:56.152 --> 25:01.738
like three a year, and probably by foreigners.

25:01.878 --> 25:12.970
But people, you know, you'd see these guys peddling around on a bicycle with a thing on the back, and I said one time to somebody who I was with, you know, what are they doing?

25:12.990 --> 25:14.311
He said, they're delivering money.

25:15.212 --> 25:23.020
You phone up the bank, and the Japanese like cash, and you order up three million yen or whatever, and

25:23.219 --> 25:29.049
and a little guy on a bicycle puts it into his carrier and pedals it off to him.

25:29.069 --> 25:30.211
It's extraordinary.

25:30.231 --> 25:34.799
So it comes to the collections, which are the measure of excellence therapy, right?

25:35.259 --> 25:37.423
One of them, certainly, and an important one.

25:37.483 --> 25:40.128
That's one of the questions I asked Carol, because it came from you.

25:40.148 --> 25:47.300
I said, is it true that if you are to achieve greatness, you have to have a great collection?

25:47.380 --> 25:48.602
Is that one of the criteria?

25:49.122 --> 25:53.487
I had never thought of it in quite those terms.

25:53.567 --> 25:55.670
I guess you really do have to acquire the chips.

25:55.710 --> 25:57.031
You have to stack the chips up.

25:57.432 --> 26:00.676
It's a very measurable index, isn't it?

26:01.116 --> 26:01.977
Sure.

26:02.077 --> 26:03.359
I hadn't thought of this before.

26:04.981 --> 26:07.864
And that's why all these institutions pay so much attention to it.

26:08.405 --> 26:12.970
They wouldn't do those kind of statistics and publish the stuff if it wasn't.

26:14.030 --> 26:15.912
considered really significant.

26:15.932 --> 26:22.580
And like Harvard giving you the running number every year, they give you the number of... It's what you're meant to strive for.

26:22.660 --> 26:26.845
And of course they do pad the figures.

26:26.985 --> 26:32.371
Of course they pad the figures, and Harvard also pays less on account of that.

26:33.432 --> 26:39.379
You know, the collection being there is supposed to be worth X thousand dollars a year.

26:40.260 --> 26:42.703
They don't have to actually give you in money.

26:42.903 --> 26:45.426
So it is said.

26:45.767 --> 26:46.508
I understand that.

26:46.528 --> 26:47.109
Do that again.

26:47.589 --> 27:08.218
If you're given an appointment, now this wouldn't be true for the senior ranks, but if you're getting your first appointment as an assistant professor at Harvard, you're going to get paid less because of the rationale being that they are providing research resources that will allow you to make yourself

27:08.468 --> 27:34.172
a great associate and thus a great pull and demand all over the world and plus the cachet being a hybrid but in in japan the uh the thing that's difficult to understand is why everyone has to have an adam smith collection i mean it wouldn't three do or

27:34.557 --> 27:37.041
whatever, or dentistry.

27:37.602 --> 27:40.106
Why do they want history of dentistry?

27:40.126 --> 27:42.049
And why do they, do you know?

27:42.069 --> 27:42.409
I don't know.

27:42.990 --> 27:44.512
It's essential to them.

27:44.533 --> 27:51.283
Well, I know a couple of dealers in London who've sold, I think, three or four.

27:51.685 --> 27:53.728
dentistry collections in Japan.

27:53.868 --> 28:01.901
So the approbation they're looking for, is it from people outside of Japan, or is this how we're measuring greatness inside of Japan?

28:01.921 --> 28:03.324
I think mainly inside.

28:03.444 --> 28:06.068
But you're measuring it by what you have of Western things.

28:07.711 --> 28:10.375
Well, I think to be fair, Japanese things too.

28:11.196 --> 28:18.688
If you like Japanese woodblock prints, which I do, in fact I don't have very many, and I stay out of those

28:19.073 --> 28:45.756
stores because it's so seductive and they're so expensive but they're a hell of a lot more expensive in Tokyo than they are here I mean if you're going to buy them you should buy them in New York or Toronto and there is a dealer in them here but I actually went around and saw the printing being done you know they still do

28:46.360 --> 28:47.641
pastiches of them.

28:47.661 --> 28:52.726
And you were saying some things out as we were walking about scanning things.

28:52.966 --> 28:54.067
Oh, yeah.

28:54.167 --> 28:59.512
Apparently, individual faculty members can order books if they want.

28:59.653 --> 29:01.334
In Japan?

29:01.835 --> 29:01.975
Mm-hmm.

29:02.695 --> 29:12.865
It goes, I believe, the route is from faculty member to the library to Marazin to Marazin.

29:14.086 --> 29:15.928
That's a company.

29:16.718 --> 29:18.501
A Japanese company?

29:18.521 --> 29:19.804
A Japanese company.

29:19.944 --> 29:26.216
No, M-A-R-U-Z-E-N.

29:30.403 --> 29:37.136
Incidentally, did you realize that the United States is the only country in the world that pronounces Z-Z?

29:38.799 --> 29:39.520
Why is that?

29:41.288 --> 29:45.774
Anyway, Marathon is with you, Shoto.

29:45.794 --> 29:48.257
They're the two biggest distributors of books.

29:48.998 --> 29:51.041
You know, everything in Japan is a monopoly.

29:51.081 --> 29:54.866
There's three car companies, two television companies.

29:55.186 --> 29:56.007
Exactly.

29:56.788 --> 29:58.951
Same with book distribution.

29:59.011 --> 30:04.759
So these guys don't just do books, they do CDs and newspapers.

30:06.841 --> 30:09.064
Tokyo has 27 daily newspapers.

30:10.286 --> 30:11.127
Maybe no matter what.

30:11.900 --> 30:14.725
a very literate country.

30:17.169 --> 30:35.899
So it comes to Maricent and then the deal was through a company in Toronto that used to be and still is to a certain extent a supplier of database stuff to U of T. In fact, it was

30:36.318 --> 30:44.162
which was the University of Toronto Library Automation System, which was sold off and has been sold again and so on.

30:44.182 --> 30:46.268
So they basically come through Canada and not the US?

30:46.288 --> 30:48.795
Yeah, and the order comes in here.

30:49.317 --> 30:50.661
And by the US?

30:50.681 --> 30:51.002
No.

30:51.168 --> 30:57.154
And this is a deal, yeah, no, it's a deal between U of T and this company.

30:57.174 --> 30:59.917
So basically, U of T basically, we'll take, we'll supply it.

31:00.037 --> 31:07.444
U of T library, you go off the stacks, get the book, digitize it, make a disc, print it out, bind it, and ship it back.

31:07.504 --> 31:09.806
And it keeps the disc.

31:09.826 --> 31:11.988
Well, you keep the master disc.

31:12.009 --> 31:12.429
We keep it here.

31:12.469 --> 31:17.614
Sure, you supply it with them with the copy.

31:17.915 --> 31:27.409
I am told, but you can't quote me on this, that that's what actually finances the digital operations here.

31:28.571 --> 31:29.892
They were quite close.

31:29.953 --> 31:34.920
So give me a name, and this won't be this trip, but let's say I come up, I was close enough.

31:35.661 --> 31:37.844
It's like coming here is like coming to Washington.

31:37.904 --> 31:44.314
I didn't realize how easy it is to come here.

31:44.374 --> 31:47.398
The person who actually does it's name is Karen

31:47.885 --> 31:51.449
K-A-R-E-N, Turco, T-U-R-K-O.

31:52.229 --> 31:53.611
She's the head of preservation.

31:54.592 --> 31:57.134
But they've done a lot of stuff with Cornell.

32:01.138 --> 32:06.744
Or at least now, I'm not sure they did stuff with Cornell, but there was some kind of attachment.

32:07.144 --> 32:07.765
Well, I'm sure.

32:07.785 --> 32:10.788
Because Cornell, look at where they are.

32:11.028 --> 32:14.652
And you've got Eastman Kodak, and you've got Xerox.

32:15.239 --> 32:18.003
And the light switched on over my head.

32:18.063 --> 32:19.545
They're giving them all this equipment.

32:19.585 --> 32:21.007
This is where they're testing.

32:21.187 --> 32:23.310
This is where they're test driving all this shit.

32:24.852 --> 32:26.855
And that's where they're getting their money.

32:26.875 --> 32:30.399
And it makes perfect sense that this would be the place to do it.

32:32.182 --> 32:35.626
And they get the machines, and they trial out.

32:35.646 --> 32:38.310
They work, they don't work, and whatever.

32:38.915 --> 32:43.440
So go ahead, this is so Karen Turco.

32:44.001 --> 32:52.050
Now, to get any more of this and to get the official line, you could tell her that I suggested you talk to me.

32:52.070 --> 32:53.352
Well, this is something I'm interested in.

32:53.412 --> 32:55.394
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

32:56.095 --> 33:01.361
I don't know if she's around right now or not.

33:01.721 --> 33:05.125
I think I'd want to prepare myself a little better for her.

33:05.290 --> 33:18.392
It's an interesting, the really interesting question, it seems to me, is whether, in fact, this technology will replace microfilm.

33:18.412 --> 33:20.015
Well, it will eventually.

33:20.155 --> 33:20.335
Yeah.

33:20.536 --> 33:20.876
When?

33:20.896 --> 33:22.218
No.

33:22.238 --> 33:23.080
It's going that way.

33:23.400 --> 33:24.663
It's going fairly fast.

33:24.803 --> 33:27.928
And, you know, they're figuring it out on a daily basis.

33:29.831 --> 33:31.534
I bought a brand new Toshiba.
