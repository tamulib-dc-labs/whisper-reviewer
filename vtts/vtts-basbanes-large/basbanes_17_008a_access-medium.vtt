WEBVTT

00:04.908 --> 00:05.829
Tell me when to start.

00:06.130 --> 00:06.570
Right now.

00:06.871 --> 00:08.313
Okay.

00:08.874 --> 00:09.975
This is recording now?

00:10.036 --> 00:10.636
Yes, it is.

00:10.757 --> 00:11.418
Can it hear me?

00:12.018 --> 00:12.439
Yep.

00:12.459 --> 00:13.421
Okay.

00:13.441 --> 00:18.428
Now, if I were to write a book, the most important thing is the title.

00:19.469 --> 00:23.896
In my case, I don't know what kind of a title, but I will say this.

00:24.557 --> 00:25.939
This should be the title.

00:26.600 --> 00:28.343
How I Got to America.

00:30.185 --> 00:30.786
All right?

00:30.806 --> 00:31.247
Yep.

00:31.267 --> 00:33.049
So far, so good.

00:33.069 --> 00:33.310
Sounds good.

00:33.330 --> 00:33.430
Okay.

00:33.612 --> 00:39.518
We'll go as far back as 1909, although I was born in 1911.

00:39.598 --> 00:43.422
Keep going, I'll be right back.

00:46.705 --> 00:51.710
So in 1909, my father George, he had a problem.

00:52.731 --> 00:54.393
He certainly did have a problem.

00:55.274 --> 01:03.062
He was serving in the army, and one day one of the boys in the village, a little kid, came running up to

01:03.616 --> 01:07.220
He found out where Georgie was based, and he found out where he had the duty.

01:08.962 --> 01:14.107
And he had a very, very serious message for him.

01:14.568 --> 01:25.039
He told him, this little boy, that his sister had been kidnapped and taken into the hills.

01:27.461 --> 01:30.805
At that point, Georgie didn't say a word.

01:31.460 --> 01:32.221
He took off.

01:32.281 --> 01:33.642
He went AWOL.

01:36.304 --> 01:41.969
The village was about three miles away from where he was stationed.

01:44.491 --> 01:49.215
And the first thing he did, he got the story from his father, whose name was Jimmy.

01:51.517 --> 02:01.045
And the father told him that this one of the boys in the village had asked for the hand

02:01.227 --> 02:05.831
in marriage of his daughter whose name was Alexandria.

02:07.833 --> 02:22.365
But he was refused because in those days you had to have a fairly decent family and my grandfather or Jimmy had a feeling that this guy just wasn't good enough for his daughter.

02:23.226 --> 02:30.272
So this guy got a couple of his friends and they kidnapped Alexandra and they took her into the hills.

02:30.708 --> 02:33.471
And they kept her there for two weeks.

02:34.211 --> 02:35.392
They ravaged her.

02:36.313 --> 02:40.897
They did everything imaginable that can be done to her.

02:40.917 --> 02:42.138
Well, it just wasn't decent.

02:42.499 --> 02:44.480
After the two weeks, they brought her back.

02:45.001 --> 02:46.703
They dumped her off in front of the house.

02:48.404 --> 02:57.252
So at that point, that's when the boy was summoned to go find George and tell him what happened.

02:58.253 --> 03:00.495
So George, that's my father,

03:01.252 --> 03:15.813
He went over to the mantelpiece, and there was a rifle there, and he took three bullets, and he went into the village and found where they all congregate at night.

03:15.833 --> 03:22.102
And they're sitting there, and there's the three guys together.

03:22.322 --> 03:29.132
As soon as they saw George coming, they get up, and they all scattered in three directions except one guy.

03:29.838 --> 03:33.603
And Georgie raised the rifle, put a bullet right between the eyes.

03:34.704 --> 03:36.406
Another guy was going up the wall.

03:37.948 --> 03:38.529
He got him.

03:38.569 --> 03:43.075
The bullet entered the base of the spine and came out from his neck.

03:44.016 --> 03:45.818
It was from a rifle, of course.

03:46.599 --> 03:51.205
Now the third guy, the actual one that committed the whole thing, was running up the road.

03:52.214 --> 04:03.551
So George chased him up the road, kept trotting away, and finally about a mile or so up the road, the guy collapsed on the ground, looked up, said, George, don't do it, don't do it.

04:03.571 --> 04:07.417
He stuck the end of the rifle into his mouth and blew his brains apart.

04:08.819 --> 04:13.406
Now, he left the body there, went back to the village, told them what they did.

04:13.506 --> 04:18.794
Nobody there, they had an idea what was going on, but they just didn't want to interfere.

04:19.775 --> 04:21.698
Now...

04:21.897 --> 04:23.319
What were they going to do with George?

04:23.399 --> 04:30.829
They started a collection, they got money together, and they decided that they would send him to America.

04:30.949 --> 04:36.377
In those days, they didn't have the immigration laws that they have today.

04:36.437 --> 04:37.519
Everything was wide open.

04:38.239 --> 04:48.073
The United States was welcoming people from all over the world to come in and get the land going, get everything going, the economy.

04:48.948 --> 04:55.116
So, George with his friends, following morning, they hustled him off.

04:55.657 --> 05:02.486
They got him on a little ship that left Piraeus, and they went into a harbor in France.

05:05.630 --> 05:09.255
From there, the boat sailed to America.

05:09.315 --> 05:18.567
When he got to New York, he managed to have a little money left, and he went out to Omaha, Nebraska.

05:19.019 --> 05:21.301
Now, mind you, he's escaping from this thing.

05:21.962 --> 05:23.263
He's gone AWL.

05:23.363 --> 05:26.747
He killed three guys, and now he went to Omaha.

05:28.028 --> 05:29.209
There he found a job.

05:30.571 --> 05:32.653
He was told that they had slaughterhouses there.

05:33.033 --> 05:37.418
He had been a cook in the Army, so he thought he'd feel pretty natural.

05:38.719 --> 05:40.080
He worked in the slaughterhouse.

05:41.021 --> 05:43.283
He gave him his real name.

05:43.304 --> 05:45.786
He didn't think anybody would go after him.

05:46.762 --> 05:49.827
While he was working there, George was an entrepreneur.

05:51.810 --> 05:53.012
Prohibition was going on.

05:53.453 --> 05:54.414
Booze was illegal.

05:55.376 --> 06:02.006
He managed to get enough money together to get this little building, so he started a house of prostitution.

06:03.408 --> 06:10.700
He provided sex for his co-workers, and in addition to that, he made booze.

06:11.521 --> 06:13.444
He distilled it, bottled it himself,

06:13.778 --> 06:17.584
He was a very capable man, so he had it coming three ways.

06:18.125 --> 06:23.934
He had the job, he was selling booze, and he was taking care of the boys.

06:25.757 --> 06:35.412
As soon as he got about over $10,000 saved together, he had a letter from his brother Jimmy telling him that everything was all set for the trial.

06:35.432 --> 06:41.642
A trial to try him for the three men that he had killed.

06:42.128 --> 06:44.372
He went back to Greece.

06:44.392 --> 06:51.584
Incidentally, the name of the village was called in those days Miritsa, but today it's called Oxinia.

06:53.067 --> 06:53.808
O-X-Y.

06:53.828 --> 06:54.870
Well, anyway, you get it.

06:56.493 --> 06:58.897
As soon as he got back, it was a big celebration.

06:59.999 --> 07:00.820
George was there.

07:00.860 --> 07:07.832
There he was greeted by his wife, my mother, and they had one son, Jimmy.

07:10.748 --> 07:16.995
And the people in the village, the authorities knew that he was going to stand trial, so they didn't arrest him.

07:18.717 --> 07:30.971
The day of the trial came, and we don't go into detail because this thing could last forever, this little... You're going to condense it, I'm sure.

07:32.613 --> 07:39.861
The high point that I remember my father telling me was when the judge looked at him and he said, George Bazbanes, you stand before me.

07:40.550 --> 07:42.553
accused of murdering three men.

07:43.234 --> 07:44.817
Are you guilty or not guilty?

07:45.478 --> 07:47.200
So the old man said, guilty.

07:47.921 --> 07:49.284
Then he said, why did you kill him?

07:50.325 --> 07:58.077
And then George says, I killed him because I defended the honor of my family.

07:58.939 --> 08:00.161
My sister was kidnapped.

08:00.201 --> 08:01.242
He went through the whole bit.

08:02.003 --> 08:03.205
And you deserted the army.

08:03.285 --> 08:05.629
Yes, to do this.

08:06.368 --> 08:11.635
And then the judge says, but you didn't have any, you shouldn't have killed them.

08:11.655 --> 08:19.866
And George says, Your Honor, what would you have done if you found that your sister was kidnapped and raped?

08:20.947 --> 08:22.609
So the judge, I'm not on trial, you are.

08:23.330 --> 08:26.174
Okay, said George, I'm all set.

08:26.294 --> 08:27.596
I am guilty.

08:27.656 --> 08:28.697
Do what you want with me.

08:30.702 --> 08:31.543
So you are guilty.

08:31.924 --> 08:32.284
Okay.

08:32.405 --> 08:33.246
The judge took off.

08:33.286 --> 08:34.648
He was gone for about a half an hour.

08:34.668 --> 08:36.791
I guess he had a couple of drinks or something.

08:37.292 --> 08:38.133
There was no jury.

08:38.554 --> 08:38.954
Come back.

08:39.595 --> 08:45.064
He says, okay, my verdict is that you are guilty and I'm going to place this case on file.

08:45.905 --> 08:46.726
Yay!

08:46.766 --> 08:47.988
That was a big celebration.

08:48.789 --> 08:50.612
That went on and on.

08:51.313 --> 08:54.859
Now, mind you, it was at that point where I was conceived.

08:55.239 --> 08:55.740
You hear me?

08:56.361 --> 08:57.182
Conceived.

08:58.816 --> 09:01.180
And now you say, how did I get to America?

09:01.921 --> 09:15.401
Well, when my mother was about eight months along or so, then my father decided to bring her and Jimmy, and there I am in the old satchel, to America.

09:16.263 --> 09:21.110
This time, when they got to New York, some friends from Lowell were waiting for him.

09:21.190 --> 09:24.054
They were pre-warned that George was coming.

09:25.777 --> 09:27.760
So they got to...

09:28.347 --> 09:29.688
Lowell, Massachusetts.

09:30.269 --> 09:31.189
How, I don't know.

09:31.370 --> 09:37.515
And it was in a stormy winter night, and it was December the 24th, 1911.

09:38.716 --> 09:46.183
As soon as he got to a little house on Little Street, it's in the village at that time.

09:46.203 --> 09:47.204
There were all Greeks there.

09:47.744 --> 09:48.945
That's right off Dummer Street.

09:49.065 --> 09:50.126
It isn't there anymore.

09:52.268 --> 09:58.033
That night I was born, day before Christmas, by a midwife.

09:59.515 --> 10:01.598
And there was no heat in the house.

10:02.539 --> 10:05.683
And all the neighbors got together, hot blankets, hot water.

10:06.824 --> 10:11.470
So that ends the story about how I got to America.

10:12.471 --> 10:14.593
December the 24th, 1911.

10:14.954 --> 10:17.857
Now we can continue this later.

10:18.498 --> 10:18.818
All right?

10:20.400 --> 10:20.601
All right.

10:20.621 --> 10:21.462
I've reached that point.

10:23.744 --> 10:24.445
Shut it off.

10:24.986 --> 10:25.827
How do you shut it off?

10:27.578 --> 10:31.224
I've reached that point, I'll tell you.

10:31.324 --> 10:44.646
Before I continue this story, I must tell you what my father did when he was in the village, when he was getting my mother ready to come back and celebrating and having a great time making me, say it any way you want.

10:45.668 --> 10:47.491
He had, he left over $10,000.

10:47.551 --> 10:51.578
Do you know what $10,000 was in 1911?

10:51.963 --> 10:54.547
It was an awful lot of money.

10:54.587 --> 11:02.281
They took that and they made a church and a school, and that's what my father left for the village before he left.

11:02.321 --> 11:11.997
Now he was a free man, and he could continue his pursuit of life, liberty.

11:12.398 --> 11:15.602
and happiness in the new world.

11:15.783 --> 11:21.590
It was then, just about at that point, I think I've gone through that.

11:22.912 --> 11:24.534
So now I'll continue.

11:24.554 --> 11:25.436
How do you stop it again?

11:25.496 --> 11:33.867
The middle one?

11:33.998 --> 11:46.317
Now, the situation in 1911 in Lowell was really a melting pot.

11:46.337 --> 11:53.728
It had a mixture of the Irish, the French, and the Greeks were coming in.

11:53.768 --> 11:58.776
The main reason was that cotton mills were hiring.

11:58.796 --> 12:02.942
Of course, they had to work from sunrise to sunset.

12:03.428 --> 12:30.330
and all they made was about three four dollars a week so my old man got a job in the boot mills and cotton now there's my mother settled on three little street with two children jimmy and me and and as soon as my mother recovered

12:30.563 --> 12:33.506
From the birth with me, the old man got her pregnant again.

12:34.947 --> 12:37.189
And who was born a year and a half later?

12:37.749 --> 12:39.311
My sister, Alexandria.

12:42.254 --> 12:46.658
So now there we are with three children.

12:46.678 --> 12:52.883
My father, he was a very virile, strong man.

12:52.943 --> 12:59.389
No sooner did she recover from that, this is my mother,

13:00.145 --> 13:03.910
from the birth of Alexandria, she got pregnant again.

13:03.930 --> 13:08.636
Now, this was a little too much for her.

13:08.696 --> 13:14.563
So the old man, he couldn't take her to a hospital.

13:14.583 --> 13:17.106
So there was a doctor, Dr. Getzopoulos.

13:18.488 --> 13:21.332
He was known as a venereal disease type doctor.

13:22.734 --> 13:27.840
So when my mother was giving birth to this other baby, the last one,

13:28.597 --> 13:30.759
He didn't do the right things, and she died.

13:30.819 --> 13:34.702
So there she was with an unborn child.

13:36.524 --> 13:44.131
Now, my brother Jimmy, he was running along with a bunch of wild kids.

13:44.151 --> 13:45.973
At that time, he was 13 years old.

13:46.993 --> 13:56.562
Two weeks after my mother died, he drowned up there in the river where the Lowell Technological Institute is.

13:57.031 --> 13:58.493
in those rapids down there.

13:59.874 --> 14:03.358
He drowned with another fellow, Andrew Drinas.

14:04.719 --> 14:06.561
Okay.

14:06.581 --> 14:09.084
Now this was too much for my father to bear.

14:09.104 --> 14:13.609
Here he is stuck with two children, me and my sister.

14:14.550 --> 14:19.876
So he was advised by Teddy Kutras, a guy who was a barber.

14:19.936 --> 14:21.598
They called him the mayor of Duma Street.

14:22.979 --> 14:24.861
He told my father to take me

14:25.415 --> 14:29.080
to take us to an orphanage called the Air Home.

14:29.981 --> 14:32.124
And this was a home for motherless children.

14:32.144 --> 14:37.872
And I remember that trip walking down Fletcher Street with my sister.

14:37.952 --> 14:39.534
We couldn't speak a word of English.

14:40.476 --> 14:41.537
We had an interpreter.

14:41.557 --> 14:50.209
And then when we got to the home, and we still see Mrs. Tarr interviewing us, finally we were accepted.

14:51.311 --> 14:55.236
So there I am in the Air Home, and my old man,

14:56.903 --> 15:02.368
did not live at 3 Little Street any longer because he lost his family practically.

15:03.109 --> 15:05.351
So he took up residence on Market Street.

15:06.032 --> 15:09.935
Now we're right in the heart of the ghetto, Market Street.

15:12.358 --> 15:13.879
My sister and I are in the home.

15:14.099 --> 15:16.642
Okay.

15:18.904 --> 15:25.510
By the time I was about 11 years old, my father decided to take me out.

15:26.097 --> 15:26.738
of the home.

15:28.060 --> 15:31.785
He left my sister in there.

15:32.646 --> 15:38.854
That's when I was like a suddenly released animal that was caged.

15:39.615 --> 15:40.356
I went wild.

15:41.378 --> 15:42.339
I had a lot of energy.

15:43.180 --> 15:44.242
I didn't know what to do with it.

15:45.944 --> 15:46.705
And we were

15:47.208 --> 15:48.169
And I was running around.

15:48.609 --> 15:54.835
This Teddy Kutus again says, George, you've got to take that son of yours who's going to get in trouble.

15:54.855 --> 15:56.277
Take him to the YMCA.

15:57.638 --> 15:58.359
I remember that.

15:58.699 --> 16:04.985
I went to the Y. I'll never forget that beautiful, wonderful man, Mr. Williams.

16:06.467 --> 16:07.988
He took a personal interest in me.

16:09.410 --> 16:10.771
He tried to tone me down.

16:12.392 --> 16:13.494
Well, I'm going to eat dinner now.

16:13.554 --> 16:15.055
We'll talk about this later.

16:15.862 --> 16:17.164
How do you stop it?

16:17.184 --> 16:18.866
Press the blue button.

16:18.886 --> 16:21.590
The blue one?

16:21.611 --> 16:21.711
Blue.

16:21.731 --> 16:24.234
There you go.

16:24.254 --> 16:25.496
I'll be out in a little while.

16:25.516 --> 16:26.177
Yeah, okay.

16:27.139 --> 16:33.067
I have... I feel as if I've admitted something very important.

16:33.088 --> 16:37.374
When I was in the air home, I was just about five years old.

16:38.435 --> 16:40.058
I had been in there for about a year.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.882
On my way to school...

16:43.688 --> 16:45.030
with a bunch of little kids.

16:45.190 --> 16:46.392
Well, it was like kindergarten.

16:47.614 --> 16:55.728
Midwinter, they had a snowball fight, and I got hit in the face with a snowball, some of the older guys.

16:57.270 --> 17:05.444
World War I was going on at the time, and they didn't have any doctors around.

17:05.484 --> 17:10.472
There were no miracle drugs like penicillin, sulfur, you name it.

17:11.110 --> 17:12.051
There were just none.

17:13.233 --> 17:20.403
And the matrons in the air home, they didn't look after you as a mother would.

17:20.424 --> 17:25.050
So my jaw, my face right under the eye, got infected.

17:25.992 --> 17:30.338
And I had a swelling about as big as a grapefruit practically.

17:31.540 --> 17:35.606
I went into the air, I went into the, they sent me to the hospital.

17:35.626 --> 17:38.029
In those days it was called the Corporation Hospital.

17:38.887 --> 17:44.852
And there was a doctor by the name of Dr. Baker, Stowell Baker.

17:44.872 --> 17:51.458
He was an eye doctor, and there he was performing surgery.

17:52.539 --> 18:06.312
So he cut me open, and to make a long story short, he left me with a scar that changed my whole attitude that had a lot to do with my outlook on life.

18:07.000 --> 18:14.311
a scar where I could touch the tip of it with my tongue, and it extended up to the corner of my left eye.

18:16.153 --> 18:24.826
Now, a five or six-year-old kid with something like that develops an inferiority complex.

18:24.846 --> 18:29.312
This made me feel that kids were staring at me, and they were.

18:29.332 --> 18:30.915
They were cruel in those days.

18:31.716 --> 18:35.421
The older guys would say, hey, scar face, and so on.

18:35.806 --> 18:44.338
So while I was in the home, I was constantly being harassed by the older kids.

18:45.460 --> 18:54.973
So when my father finally got me out about the age of 11, this complex continued.

18:54.993 --> 18:55.674
It continued.

18:56.315 --> 19:03.486
And now when I was on the streets, a free man, because my old man at that time was working at the sack of old shops.

19:04.046 --> 19:05.188
He was in the foundry.

19:05.827 --> 19:07.389
and he was also making booze.

19:08.551 --> 19:09.893
We were living on Market Street.

19:13.138 --> 19:23.834
It was just about that time when I got into the Y, and now the kids over there were real bad about the scar on my face.

19:24.736 --> 19:29.943
Then I'd go over to the Lowell Boys Club, and they'd started, especially the Irish kids.

19:30.845 --> 19:32.948
Hey, Greek, hey, Scarface.

19:33.468 --> 19:39.974
That infuriated me, and I was a tough little guy, and I really flattened a lot of them.

19:39.994 --> 19:53.346
I was pretty good, but I wanted... Now I'm going along, it's like 12, 13, 14 years old, and this scar was very, very with me.

19:53.406 --> 19:55.328
I just didn't know how to cope.

19:55.908 --> 19:59.171
So Mr. Williams at the YMCA took a personal interest in me.

20:00.532 --> 20:03.475
He says, Johnny, you can't go through life with a chip on your shoulder.

20:03.961 --> 20:10.689
You can't have people, you imagine that people are staring at you on account of the scar.

20:10.709 --> 20:18.218
Miss Mansfield at the Bartlett School, she was another person that tried to help me out psychologically.

20:19.840 --> 20:25.407
Major J's at the Boys Club, he didn't try to help me like that.

20:26.008 --> 20:27.690
What he did was promote fights.

20:28.511 --> 20:30.593
He'd get an Irishman to call me out.

20:31.872 --> 20:34.475
Scarface, and he knew that there'd be a fight.

20:35.236 --> 20:36.798
He couldn't find a guy that could lick me.

20:38.179 --> 20:46.949
So I developed an attitude that I should be a boxer, a fighter, but T.R.

20:46.989 --> 20:48.171
Williams talked me out of it.

20:49.092 --> 20:52.676
He says, a good wallop on the side of your face will split that scar open.

20:53.998 --> 20:54.558
Don't do it.

20:55.740 --> 21:00.445
He says, if you want to help yourself and your fellow man,

21:01.454 --> 21:10.685
He says, be successful, be good, be of service to people, try to help people, and they won't look at your scar, they'll look at you.

21:10.725 --> 21:12.888
That was his gospel.

21:13.789 --> 21:14.610
I loved that man.

21:14.650 --> 21:22.980
My father was very busy at the time, busy working in the foundry, selling booze, and I'd come home and he'd have a different woman night after night.

21:24.122 --> 21:28.407
This happened mostly when we were up on Worthen Street.

21:29.011 --> 21:36.760
Worden Street was in the same section, but it was very close to the Sackle Oil shops where he worked.

21:38.461 --> 21:43.307
Now we're in the 20s, and all this was going on.

21:44.468 --> 21:58.123
So in the Bartlett School, I was beginning to get over the scar because Miss Mansfield constantly took me aside, and she talked to me, and she made me feel so good.

21:58.745 --> 22:05.474
she talked to me like a mother as you know which I didn't have and T.R.

22:05.514 --> 22:28.144
Williams at the Y so between the two of them they they molded a character that I feel is with me this very day I can look a person square in the face today and not think about my appearance and the reason why well let's see now let's

22:28.951 --> 22:31.253
All my thoughts are coming to me very fast.

22:32.375 --> 22:34.417
But this car was very important to me.

22:36.499 --> 22:41.544
And I felt as if I had conquered it until I met Georgia.

22:42.605 --> 22:46.950
One day I walked into the store where she worked.

22:46.970 --> 22:49.552
She was working as a clerk in a dry cleaning store.

22:50.173 --> 22:57.861
At this time, I'm in my 20s now, I was driving a truck for laundry.

22:58.702 --> 23:02.265
And I had loaned $10 to this fellow by the name of Chris.

23:02.966 --> 23:05.828
Chris Pelicasas, to be exact.

23:05.848 --> 23:07.890
I walked into this door, and there's this little girl.

23:09.311 --> 23:14.836
She was about 17, 18, not 18, reading a book.

23:17.859 --> 23:20.101
She didn't even look up.

23:20.121 --> 23:23.203
She finished the page, and then she looked up and looked me square in the face.

23:24.244 --> 23:28.708
And she looked up, and she said, what an interesting scar you have.

23:29.920 --> 23:32.082
Well, let me tell you something.

23:32.102 --> 23:35.265
It was just like the bomb in Hiroshima.

23:35.285 --> 23:38.509
I looked at that girl and I fell in love with her that very minute.

23:40.471 --> 23:46.036
She was telling me that I had an interesting scar.

23:46.056 --> 23:47.898
Well, I married her two years later.

23:49.580 --> 23:53.484
Okay, now we'll forget that part.

23:53.504 --> 23:54.044
Now, let's see.

23:54.445 --> 23:55.045
Mother's death.

23:55.125 --> 23:56.066
I have explained that.

23:56.867 --> 23:58.829
My father's lifestyle.

23:58.849 --> 23:59.910
Okay, he was...

24:01.443 --> 24:04.946
Like I say, he worked in the foundry.

24:04.966 --> 24:11.292
He was busy with the women, one woman after another, and an orphanage.

24:11.312 --> 24:13.654
And I have to explain my stay at the orphanage.

24:14.575 --> 24:16.777
How did this influence you?

24:16.797 --> 24:30.589
Well, I think that the final, the bottom line on those three categories stayed until I met Georgia.

24:31.649 --> 24:35.433
After Georgia, it was just another world, another outlook.

24:36.654 --> 24:37.875
Oh, yeah, wait a minute now.

24:37.955 --> 24:40.578
Before I met Georgia, I was pretty active in sports.

24:42.760 --> 24:44.201
I was a city tennis champ.

24:44.261 --> 24:45.943
I was a two-state diving champ.

24:46.844 --> 24:48.666
I went for individual sports.

24:49.607 --> 24:51.488
I swam on the river.

24:51.609 --> 24:52.389
I won races.

24:52.409 --> 25:01.318
I tried to prove that a five-foot-six person was just as good as a six-footer.

25:02.075 --> 25:03.797
by going into individual sports.

25:04.118 --> 25:14.733
I was not a good team player, even though I was busy at the Y. I didn't go for basketball.

25:14.773 --> 25:15.394
I couldn't anyway.

25:15.474 --> 25:16.115
I was too short.

25:16.716 --> 25:18.859
But in the summer, T.R.

25:18.879 --> 25:22.044
Williams let me work my way out at the Y by washing dishes.

25:23.225 --> 25:24.868
And then I worked my way up to head cook.

25:26.029 --> 25:30.816
So in 1932, I got my job.

25:32.517 --> 25:33.639
driving a truck.

25:35.101 --> 25:37.664
And then I met Georgia in 1935.

25:39.086 --> 25:45.335
And then in 1939... Wait a minute.

25:45.355 --> 25:49.040
I met Georgia in 19... 1937.

25:49.060 --> 25:53.006
And then we got married in 1939.

25:53.426 --> 25:58.253
And all this time I'm driving a truck for scriptures laundry.

25:58.273 --> 26:01.157
Incidentally, I started off at $10 a week

26:01.593 --> 26:03.815
and I finally finished up at 35.

26:04.396 --> 26:05.517
That was big money.

26:06.738 --> 26:08.921
My boss wouldn't give me any more money in 1942.

26:09.081 --> 26:16.769
I get a job up at Remington Arms making bullets, and that's when I started my business.

26:18.110 --> 26:21.674
I had a 1942 station wagon.

26:22.855 --> 26:29.322
I went out and picked up laundry, dry cleaning, and I had them done by local laundries.

26:30.550 --> 26:41.084
Now, at that time, I was living up on Third Street with George, and I had two sons, George and Nick, one married in 41, one in 43.

26:41.284 --> 26:52.920
The most important thing that one must remember in my life was that I had this inferiority complex on the count of my scar.

26:55.123 --> 26:58.988
There was a lot of bigotry going on in those days.

27:00.014 --> 27:01.676
The Irish were fighting the Greeks.

27:01.896 --> 27:03.238
The Greeks were fighting the Irish.

27:03.979 --> 27:07.023
The French, they didn't get into the fights very much.

27:07.803 --> 27:13.010
But they stayed by themselves and they thought that they were the greatest in the world.

27:13.671 --> 27:14.952
All this stuff was going on.

27:16.534 --> 27:20.479
And World War II come along.

27:23.202 --> 27:26.486
And by that time, people were pretty well broad-minded.

27:27.007 --> 27:28.789
They were getting over this bigotry.

27:31.013 --> 27:34.517
And it was not a bad attitude.

27:35.157 --> 27:43.466
And Georgia always gave me the feeling that I was a very much superior person than the ordinary person.

27:44.887 --> 27:51.554
She talked me out of quitting the laundry as a driver and going in for myself.

27:52.535 --> 27:58.962
Very ambitious, aggressive, and a good mother.

27:59.887 --> 28:27.987
a wonderful influence and between the two of us we started a business up on well at first we were wrapping the shirts up in the cellar at home on Christian Street and she worked very hard two sons and taking care of two little boys

28:28.878 --> 28:55.932
one three one one boy two years between them very young running the business 1945 i was drafted i went into the navy i was in for one year and while i was in there george had tried keeping the business going but she couldn't take it it was too much when i got out in 1946 we still had the station wagon

28:57.346 --> 29:02.892
And I continued where I left off, getting people to do the work.

29:02.912 --> 29:03.553
This went on.

29:04.734 --> 29:10.280
We were working from the cellar in a building in the back of the house on Christian Street.

29:11.601 --> 29:17.628
And then I saw this piece of land up on Middle 6th Street.

29:19.049 --> 29:21.632
I got up over the girl that she knew me.

29:22.693 --> 29:24.315
She helped me by it.

29:27.282 --> 29:34.093
By, well, anyway, the lawyer was George Eliades.

29:35.075 --> 29:40.303
And he was trying to sell the land to the Gulf Oil Company.

29:40.844 --> 29:42.347
But she wanted me to have it.

29:43.248 --> 29:44.711
And she wanted me to have it cheap.

29:45.873 --> 29:47.175
So she helped me get it.

29:48.397 --> 29:50.961
And that's where the plant that we have today...
