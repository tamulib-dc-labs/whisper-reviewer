00:03.727 --> 00:04.688
I'm taping, okay?

00:06.331 --> 00:07.513
I'm talking to Mario Puzo.

00:07.553 --> 00:08.674
Congratulations, sir.

00:09.596 --> 00:09.916
Thank you.

00:11.198 --> 00:19.190
I wonder, I have a sense that there's a love-hate here like Hollywood and Vegas.

00:19.270 --> 00:21.693
I'm wondering about the twin themes here.

00:23.035 --> 00:30.426
You know, there's places that I know, you know, so a writer likes to write about places that they know.

00:31.182 --> 00:37.091
I guess it was Time Magazine that suggested maybe you're settling a few scores with some Hollywood text.

00:37.632 --> 00:38.554
Is there anything to that?

00:38.574 --> 00:38.874
Not really.

00:39.896 --> 00:43.602
I'm not subconsciously, you know.

00:43.622 --> 00:48.269
But I wasn't doing it to sales.

00:48.830 --> 00:50.432
I had a good time in Hollywood.

00:50.452 --> 00:54.659
I mean, you know, I like the people, give birth, and, you know.

00:56.021 --> 00:59.046
So I guess

01:01.456 --> 01:04.520
It's really trying to show them as they are.

01:04.620 --> 01:08.665
You know, I don't necessarily disapprove of what they do.

01:08.685 --> 01:14.693
Of course, there's a suggestion about the Ernest Bale character, who I thought was quite wonderful.

01:18.097 --> 01:24.886
Well, I mean, you had a similar in terms of the threat, but you were kind of basically screwed on The Godfather.

01:24.986 --> 01:26.788
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:27.578 --> 01:30.982
I guess you were more or less drawing on personal experience.

01:31.142 --> 01:33.565
Oh, sure.

01:33.585 --> 01:40.253
And, you know, twice I had to sue to get my money, you know.

01:42.816 --> 01:50.946
Can you tell me, and I've already seen it with the first few reviews that have appeared, I read the book, I couldn't put it down.

01:51.026 --> 01:54.430
I took it with me on a trip, and it was wonderful.

01:55.253 --> 01:59.877
But clearly the comparisons with The Godfather are inevitable.

01:59.897 --> 02:01.098
Were you mindful of that?

02:02.159 --> 02:06.403
Yeah, I knew it would be compared, you know, but so what?

02:06.424 --> 02:07.845
You know, it didn't make any difference.

02:07.865 --> 02:11.128
I was writing what I thought was another book, you know.

02:16.793 --> 02:25.041
It's sort of like, you know, it's the world I know best, you know, fictionally.

02:27.873 --> 02:31.478
How important is it for you to get it right?

02:31.539 --> 02:37.868
There's this sense, certainly they talk about the mafia guys the first time around.

02:38.529 --> 02:46.121
I heard stories that you used to get bottles of champagne at restaurants and you'd look up and there would be people, you know.

02:46.622 --> 02:50.367
Yeah, a couple of times, you know, not much so.

02:50.387 --> 02:56.817
But you did kind of, there was a sense that you mythologized that culture.

02:57.218 --> 03:05.255
I mean, that was, it struck me, I'm not a realist, you know.

03:06.218 --> 03:07.540
You say you're not a realist.

03:07.560 --> 03:08.623
No.

03:08.643 --> 03:15.177
I mean, it's like, excuse me, I just wanted to say this a thing.

03:22.700 --> 03:24.422
Do you hate living always in a house?

03:24.442 --> 03:27.445
Yeah, because in my house, I feel like I've got everything under control.

03:28.146 --> 03:32.751
Once I go into a hotel, I'm sure, shut up the mercy, you know?

03:32.771 --> 03:38.978
It's like you don't have control anymore, you know?

03:40.860 --> 03:48.208
I read also that the phrase, the godfather, that really was not a word that was used until you invented it.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.530
No, that's my proudest boast.

03:50.999 --> 03:53.321
And, of course, you realize that word has entered the language.

03:53.622 --> 03:53.882
Yeah.

03:53.902 --> 03:56.424
Like you had Coach Mark Trotter's book?

03:56.444 --> 03:57.946
Like me and my friend Joe Heller.

03:58.026 --> 03:58.526
Catch-22.

03:58.666 --> 03:58.847
Yeah.

03:59.747 --> 04:06.694
So it's amazing that, you know, we've been friends for, what, 40 years or something?

04:06.714 --> 04:10.338
Played cards together and, you know, working on our first books and we're still friends.

04:11.179 --> 04:15.022
So it's an amazing coincidence that he gave Catch-22 to the language and I gave Godfrey.

04:15.042 --> 04:15.263
Yeah.

04:15.703 --> 04:17.965
Now, that's something I would like to explore.

04:17.985 --> 04:20.888
I mean, you are buddies going back before either one of you.

04:21.155 --> 04:22.417
Before we published.

04:22.657 --> 04:23.919
How did that happen?

04:23.959 --> 04:24.500
How did you?

04:24.600 --> 04:33.933
Well, I knew a friend of his at the New School, George Mendel, who was also a writer, very, the most talented of the three of us, in fact.

04:34.874 --> 04:36.096
He introduced me to Joe.

04:36.577 --> 04:37.498
We became friends.

04:38.359 --> 04:39.120
We used to play cards.

04:39.140 --> 04:45.650
You know, working guys working on books, they're also wanting to have a card game, you know, stuff like that.

04:46.831 --> 04:48.073
And, you know,

04:48.610 --> 04:52.634
You talk about literature, you play cards, you know, it was a night out, you know.

04:53.415 --> 04:59.000
And it's like, you know, and it continued over the years, you know.

04:59.061 --> 05:07.189
Did you ever talk about, I mean, did you ever kind of fantasize about the kind of success both of you have enjoyed?

05:09.111 --> 05:09.251
Yeah.

05:09.291 --> 05:10.832
That's amazing, isn't it?

05:10.852 --> 05:12.214
Yeah.

05:12.234 --> 05:13.555
Now, he hit it in 61.

05:13.575 --> 05:15.157
61 was catch-22.

05:15.317 --> 05:17.419
It was in 61?

05:17.821 --> 05:22.991
I hadn't known them a long time ago, but I remember that George Mandel tried to peddle the book for him.

05:23.011 --> 05:23.792
He used to carry it on.

05:23.852 --> 05:25.876
George Mandel had already been published, see.

05:26.838 --> 05:30.264
And, uh, what did it look like?

05:33.229 --> 05:37.818
When you were in part of a street mob, you know, like when you were kids.

05:38.960 --> 05:41.685
Sometimes we'd talk books, and most of the time not.

05:44.737 --> 06:01.071
We were just saying how he and his good friend Joe Heller both gave to the world words that invented the language, the Godfather, in Catch-22, the phrase, which actually... Catch-22, he made that up, you know.

06:01.331 --> 06:04.037
Well, it was actually going to be Catch-48 or something.

06:04.117 --> 06:05.580
At first, he was going to call it

06:05.729 --> 06:11.795
Yeah, but the Israeli guy... Yeah, Leon Urich, I guess, had a book on Milo or something.

06:11.815 --> 06:14.358
Yeah, he used that number, so he had to change the number.

06:14.618 --> 06:15.439
Yeah, he changed the number.

06:15.459 --> 06:16.160
Yeah, I've read that story.

06:16.180 --> 06:30.655
Catch-22's... But even then, it has entered the language even as it has a context, and the Godfather, of course, prior to your use of the word was, you know, you baptized a child, and now, of course, it has a cultural context to it.

06:30.675 --> 06:32.597
The equivalent would be if...

06:35.176 --> 06:41.083
I turned the term uncle and aunt into, it became automatically dancers.

06:41.103 --> 06:42.985
You told somebody your aunt or your uncle.

06:43.706 --> 06:48.893
It says, I invented a new meaning for the word, purely by writing.

06:48.913 --> 06:51.936
You know, it wasn't like I'm going to invent a new meaning for the word.

06:51.976 --> 06:58.264
It comes from the whole horror of the book.

06:58.649 --> 07:02.533
So that order particularly fits and particularly sits in the imagination.

07:02.854 --> 07:04.496
Now, you said you're not a realist?

07:04.516 --> 07:07.439
I'm not a realistic novelist, no.

07:07.779 --> 07:09.041
What are you then?

07:09.281 --> 07:09.902
Romantic novelist.

07:09.922 --> 07:16.890
You know, my books about the mafia are myths, they're not reality.

07:16.910 --> 07:27.762
So when I see something like that, New York Magazine, when it had these three experts saying the mafia is completely different, of course it is.

07:28.282 --> 07:29.924
Their mafia is not my mafia.

07:29.944 --> 07:33.027
Of course, their mafia meaning the real mafia.

07:33.047 --> 07:33.788
Yeah.

07:33.868 --> 07:41.437
And I read that piece in New York, and they said, well, these guys are really vicious, stupid, cutthroat individuals.

07:41.457 --> 07:42.478
They're not my guys.

07:43.078 --> 07:49.606
But your guys, really, there is an aura of, you have romanticized them to it.

07:49.826 --> 07:50.106
Yeah.

07:50.547 --> 07:52.629
And I get that from the Sicilian mafia.

07:52.889 --> 07:55.152
That's how they were at one time.

07:55.192 --> 07:58.035
They were really, you know,

07:59.180 --> 08:01.663
what I make them out to be, or close to it.

08:01.683 --> 08:04.886
The American Mafia I don't think was ever close to that.

08:04.906 --> 08:10.391
So, where did you—you say you're not a realistic writer, but there certainly is an attention to detail.

08:10.411 --> 08:14.756
You certainly know the ambiance of an Italian neighborhood.

08:14.776 --> 08:28.009
But I'm not exposing the evil of working in mines, or the evil of the criminal front, or what—I'm not a realist.

08:28.129 --> 08:28.950
I'm not a realist.

08:29.048 --> 08:34.634
in the sense that Zola is a realist, you know, or Balzac.

08:34.654 --> 08:38.739
I don't know what you would call Balzac or Mr. Prydom.

08:38.759 --> 08:46.168
But I think of myself as a romantic writer.

08:46.188 --> 08:51.334
And yet, you know, I've been told that I'm so gruel and this and that, but it's bullshit.

08:54.578 --> 08:56.760
I'm a very sore part of writing.

08:57.162 --> 09:01.626
You notice I never condemn any of my characters, hardly ever than I know of.

09:01.726 --> 09:04.288
And to the bad guys that get croaked, too, usually.

09:05.149 --> 09:05.249
Yeah.

09:05.269 --> 09:11.895
I mean, even guys you don't like, ah, they had a good side to you.

09:11.915 --> 09:12.916
I mean, that's all I do.

09:13.416 --> 09:24.226
One of the things I enjoyed about this book, and the criticisms I have of so many other books, is that I really do have, the characterizations are really clear.

09:24.926 --> 09:27.068
I mean, I really have a sense

09:27.368 --> 09:29.130
a picture of a character by the name.

09:29.170 --> 09:34.035
I mean, it's not just one character after all of these wooden characters with names.

09:34.055 --> 09:40.701
You really have done a pretty nice job, I think, of giving them personalities and developing them.

09:40.721 --> 09:44.485
Did you have any models for these, or are they strictly all inventions?

09:46.187 --> 09:55.536
They're models in the sense that when I was a kid, there were certain figures in the neighborhood that got respect, you know.

09:56.292 --> 10:00.878
You didn't quite know why, but they got it.

10:00.898 --> 10:04.623
But even they, you didn't pick it in as gangsters.

10:05.584 --> 10:10.511
They were like a facility, like the Red Cross, or you go to see your congressman, you know.

10:10.531 --> 10:12.473
These were the guys that could solve the trouble.

10:14.175 --> 10:18.802
Did you feel a sense of, now this was the first book in what, six, eight years?

10:18.822 --> 10:19.042
Five years.

10:19.182 --> 10:20.243
Five years.

10:20.384 --> 10:25.270
And I know that you've been sick in the interim.

10:25.587 --> 10:32.555
Was there a sense of anxiety in your part about, you know, the ballplayers, they bring in the heat and everything?

10:32.575 --> 10:33.076
Yeah, sure.

10:33.276 --> 10:37.721
You know, that's where Carol was a big help, and John was a big help.

10:37.781 --> 10:38.902
He encouraged me, you know.

10:41.085 --> 10:46.992
And how about, you know, you said in your piece, John, that it really required very little editing, apparently.

10:47.733 --> 10:53.299
No, but that's not really true, because he had sent me, what was it?

10:54.038 --> 11:00.004
six-page memorandum, eight-page memorandum, with about 60 things to be fixed.

11:00.024 --> 11:00.825
So I fixed them.

11:01.526 --> 11:07.232
He was right about 90, 95 percent of the time, where I disagreed, I told him.

11:07.912 --> 11:18.283
But otherwise, actually, within that criticism he gave in a book, I collected that criticism, so he was happy with the end result.

11:18.303 --> 11:20.265
And apparently the title came

11:21.123 --> 11:22.966
Much later, you had your color.

11:23.246 --> 11:25.449
Well, the color I wanted was the Claracruzio.

11:25.930 --> 11:26.991
Nobody else wanted it.

11:27.312 --> 11:35.884
Even my darling girlfriend there, my consigliera, she voted against me.

11:35.904 --> 11:37.366
I was willing to fight John.

11:37.386 --> 11:38.768
I was willing to fight Random House.

11:38.788 --> 11:41.211
I wasn't willing to fight that.

11:41.311 --> 11:49.763
So, really then, you don't really visualize this particular character as the last gun.

11:52.173 --> 11:55.398
Because I understand you're also considering another novel.

11:55.538 --> 12:01.688
In a sense, I don't think that democracy can operate in the open anymore.

12:01.708 --> 12:08.719
They have to operate under a legal quote for some time, like big business does.

12:08.759 --> 12:11.243
Big business does terrible things, but it's illegal.

12:12.665 --> 12:13.887
That's why I say the last son.

12:13.927 --> 12:20.357
He's going to pass into the structure of American business, and then he can do things

12:22.109 --> 12:32.379
You know, the first two books that you did, you don't mind my jumping around the block here.

12:32.399 --> 12:41.848
I mean, I read the book, and I love the book, and so it's kind of foolish of me to ask you questions for answers, and I already know.

12:43.430 --> 12:51.998
Your first two books were considered very literary books, and in fact, one of the words they used was E. Nelson Hayes from your first book.

12:52.332 --> 12:56.496
you know, on that little pitch for the very first novel with a Boston book.

12:56.576 --> 12:57.637
By Nelson Aldrin?

12:57.657 --> 13:01.982
No, it's a guy, a reviewer, by the name of E. Nelson Hayes, who reviewed the book on The Globe.

13:02.002 --> 13:04.905
He used to review books for me years ago when I was a book editor.

13:04.925 --> 13:05.906
He's now dead.

13:05.966 --> 13:07.668
He loved that book.

13:07.688 --> 13:15.355
And, I mean, did you despair, I mean, at any point that, Jesus Christ, I'm writing these beautiful, literary books?

13:15.375 --> 13:17.057
Sure, that's why I wrote The Grandfather.

13:17.077 --> 13:21.782
At the end of The Fortunate Pilgrim, where I got wonderful

13:22.133 --> 13:26.159
I mean, the New York Times itself called it a small classic.

13:26.299 --> 13:31.287
I wish I had left out the small, but, you know, that's good enough, right?

13:31.307 --> 13:33.210
So that was my second novel.

13:33.410 --> 13:38.038
I published two novels, and I was poorer than when I started.

13:38.058 --> 13:44.748
And I grew up believing that if you publish a novel, you automatically became rich and famous and, you know.

13:44.868 --> 13:46.070
Especially one that was good.

13:46.250 --> 13:46.591
Yeah.

13:46.671 --> 13:49.255
Well, you got terrific, terrific reviews.

13:50.534 --> 13:54.198
And then I couldn't even sell it to a paperback house.

13:54.218 --> 13:58.382
That pissed me off more than anything else.

13:58.402 --> 14:02.526
I always used to brag to my family and my friends.

14:02.586 --> 14:05.169
I could write a bestseller whenever I wanted.

14:05.189 --> 14:08.152
I wouldn't demean myself to write a bestseller.

14:09.533 --> 14:13.537
I certainly would never sell a book of mine to the movies.

14:13.718 --> 14:16.120
That's kind of bullshit, but I was a young guy, you know?

14:16.994 --> 14:18.276
This is idealism, huh?

14:18.496 --> 14:21.420
This was kind of the idealism of youth.

14:21.440 --> 14:29.810
Yeah, well, I grew up in a culture, when we all went down to New School after the war, everybody wanted to be a great writer.

14:30.150 --> 14:35.697
The biggest insult you could tell a guy is that if you write for the movies, you're going to sell your book for the movies.

14:35.797 --> 14:36.158
Selling artists.

14:36.178 --> 14:37.580
I love that phrase, you're selling.

14:37.600 --> 14:38.801
What the hell do we do this for?

14:39.402 --> 14:40.183
Not to make a buck.

14:40.383 --> 14:41.865
Yeah, well, you've got to make a living.

14:42.005 --> 14:44.368
And I must say, I believe

14:45.108 --> 14:59.946
All the principles, like, I was taught, you know, in the literature, real serious literature process, in the novel, everything must conform to the, there should be nothing extraneous about it.

15:00.627 --> 15:08.897
Even if you write something really good, if it doesn't belong in that book, if it's something absolutely necessary to that book, you shouldn't cut it out.

15:09.938 --> 15:11.200
So I did that on my first book.

15:11.585 --> 15:13.407
But in the Godfather, I threw everything in it.

15:14.107 --> 15:16.429
Because it was funny, because it was exciting.

15:16.489 --> 15:25.717
So as far as the overall structure of the book, you can find a lot of fault that I had a lot of stuff in there that you should have thrown out.

15:25.737 --> 15:31.082
But some of it was some of the most funny and interesting stuff in the book.

15:31.543 --> 15:33.484
So I came around the other way, you know.

15:34.125 --> 15:38.188
In other words, I came piece by piece to write in a bestseller.

15:38.268 --> 15:40.090
I determined to write a bestseller.

15:40.829 --> 15:41.530
Mindfully.

15:41.950 --> 15:42.310
Huh?

15:42.330 --> 15:43.051
Mindfully.

15:43.111 --> 15:44.953
You mindfully set out something.

15:44.973 --> 15:46.394
I set out to write a bestseller.

15:47.215 --> 15:49.397
I studied all the bestsellers.

15:49.437 --> 15:50.077
Did you?

15:50.097 --> 15:50.197
Yeah.

15:50.217 --> 15:52.359
Well, who in particular impressed you?

15:53.220 --> 15:57.624
Uh, who were they?

15:57.644 --> 16:04.710
Uh, Kyle Robbins, who really was a very good writer at one point.

16:04.970 --> 16:08.534
Yeah, and also a very crafty writer.

16:08.554 --> 16:10.195
You know, he was a very crafty guy.

16:10.799 --> 16:18.891
And he started off as a serious quote writer, and was smart enough to know he had to write bestsellers.

16:19.952 --> 16:24.118
But the thing is, I don't see why you can't write a bestseller in a serious book.

16:24.278 --> 16:28.484
You know, a so-called literary book.

16:28.504 --> 16:38.258
Yeah, I mean, it seems that once you make a lot of money... They've got it for you.

16:39.402 --> 16:44.509
I must say, you know, I have to say the critics have treated me wonderfully well.

16:44.529 --> 16:46.832
I have absolutely no complaints about it.

16:46.912 --> 16:50.016
I might.

16:50.036 --> 16:58.027
On all my books, it seems like I got, you know, I got some bad reviews, but as I keep saying, you can't put your mill hitter against the critics.

16:58.247 --> 16:59.589
No novelist can.

16:59.609 --> 17:01.211
So it seems like I haven't put it together.

17:01.231 --> 17:04.255
I got the next of it, you know, on every book.

17:04.816 --> 17:06.338
Even the children's book I would.

17:07.803 --> 17:09.365
How do you know you wrote a children's book?

17:09.385 --> 17:11.308
Yeah, wrote a children's book.

17:11.408 --> 17:14.072
The New Yorker has never mentioned any of my novels.

17:15.874 --> 17:18.838
They gave my children's book a terrific review.

17:18.878 --> 17:20.961
It's the only time I ever appeared in a New Yorker.

17:21.902 --> 17:24.346
What was the name of the children's book?

17:25.207 --> 17:29.252
The Summer of Davy Shore or something like that.

17:29.352 --> 17:30.814
You're kidding.

17:31.055 --> 17:32.697
You don't have it on the press?

17:33.470 --> 17:34.411
Did you know that?

17:34.492 --> 17:37.236
No, I saw it in a bookshelf.

17:38.037 --> 17:41.582
The New Yorker magazine gave me a big review.

17:42.364 --> 17:43.005
What's it about?

17:43.245 --> 17:43.465
Huh?

17:43.505 --> 17:44.146
What's it about?

17:44.787 --> 17:46.911
Is it for little kids or young readers?

17:46.991 --> 17:47.772
No, no.

17:48.573 --> 17:50.416
Actually, what it was was Home Alone.

17:50.436 --> 17:55.884
I wasn't smart enough to be as obvious as Home Alone.

17:56.866 --> 18:01.553
It's about kids' parents go to Europe without them.

18:03.001 --> 18:06.786
and leave them all alone in America to stay with his grandfather.

18:06.806 --> 18:09.989
He runs away from his grandfather and he travels all across the country.

18:10.890 --> 18:12.893
What's the name of my children's book, honey?

18:13.994 --> 18:16.117
Oh, The Runaway Summer of Davey Shaw.

18:16.157 --> 18:17.398
What did I say?

18:17.418 --> 18:19.581
The Runaway Summer of Davey Shaw.

18:19.721 --> 18:22.144
Davey, D-A-V-E-Y?

18:22.164 --> 18:22.765
S-H-O-R-E?

18:24.727 --> 18:25.568
S-H-A-W-S-N.

18:25.588 --> 18:26.029
Oh, Shaw.

18:26.449 --> 18:27.510
Yeah, Shaw.

18:27.530 --> 18:32.316
But I knocked that out to make a couple of thousand books while I was writing The Godfather.

18:32.903 --> 18:34.925
you know, because it's an extra source of cash.

18:35.625 --> 18:37.908
I wrote it, I think, in a month.

18:37.928 --> 18:42.552
So there comes the New Yorker magazine for the first time giving me the time of day, you know?

18:43.953 --> 18:46.615
And did this come out prior to The Godfather or after it?

18:47.236 --> 18:49.058
Oh, prior to The Godfather.

18:49.078 --> 18:51.400
But they didn't notice any of the other books?

18:51.420 --> 18:52.921
No, never mentioned my name.

18:52.941 --> 18:54.042
So why do you suppose that is?

18:55.864 --> 18:56.825
They don't like them.

18:56.845 --> 18:58.226
I'm not alliterating.

18:58.246 --> 18:59.107
That's irrelevant.

18:59.347 --> 19:01.689
I mean, they're pretty clear when they don't like things.

19:01.769 --> 19:02.590
I mean, they say

19:02.772 --> 19:05.554
I don't think they considered me important enough to review.

19:06.876 --> 19:08.457
Would that bother you at some point?

19:08.577 --> 19:09.298
No, no.

19:09.598 --> 19:10.559
I love the New Yorker.

19:10.579 --> 19:12.200
New York is my favorite magazine.

19:12.240 --> 19:14.422
Still even with the new group that's running it?

19:14.542 --> 19:18.686
Yep, still my favorite, but they give you stuff that no other magazine gives you.

19:20.547 --> 19:25.151
I would have always loved to have been noticed.

19:25.912 --> 19:31.497
I remember my first book, I felt very complimented when Patterson Reviews destroyed me.

19:32.202 --> 19:37.049
To be destroyed by partisan review was such a... It's an honor.

19:37.069 --> 19:37.590
It's a coup.

19:37.810 --> 19:40.013
It's a coup to be destroyed by partisan.

19:40.053 --> 19:43.538
They take you seriously enough to destroy you, you know?

19:45.041 --> 19:49.567
And New York had never paid attention to The Godfather.

19:49.788 --> 19:53.112
I was not to that taste.

19:54.775 --> 19:55.336
I assume.

19:55.596 --> 19:56.037
I assume.

19:56.497 --> 19:59.762
You mean you don't even slightly get a little pissed off when you see a bad review?

20:01.058 --> 20:05.182
No, I really, I'll tell you, you know what I feel like?

20:06.443 --> 20:12.288
Like on a Godfather, I got, I think, 99% good reviews.

20:13.710 --> 20:24.560
So, I read a bad review, I think it was in the Daily Times, I forget the guy's name, who was pissed off on me for selling out, because I had an alliterated review.

20:24.620 --> 20:29.144
Now, I read that review, I've got 99 solid reviews.

20:29.164 --> 20:30.205
You know what I think of this guy?

20:30.961 --> 20:33.284
He was smart enough to find out how fake I was.

20:34.907 --> 20:37.751
You know, like, he's the guy that really was on to me.

20:37.951 --> 20:41.436
I fooled the other 99 guys, but he was too smart.

20:41.677 --> 20:45.202
Are you teasing me now, or are you mindfully trying to fool people?

20:45.222 --> 20:45.422
Huh?

20:45.622 --> 20:49.949
Are you teasing me now, or are you mindfully trying to fool people, do you think?

20:49.969 --> 20:55.236
He said, I fooled the 99, I fooled... It's a way of thinking... Negatively.

20:56.278 --> 20:58.581
It's very common with actors and actresses.

20:59.282 --> 20:59.803
You know, just...

21:00.712 --> 21:02.213
Ninety-nine people from London.

21:02.294 --> 21:03.355
One person hates them.

21:04.536 --> 21:05.296
They're ready to commit suicide.

21:05.317 --> 21:11.262
So when you're thinking, I'm going to write a bestseller, there are bestsellers and there are 21 million books.

21:11.302 --> 21:17.148
Did you ever, in your wildest expectations, think that it would have that kind of an impact?

21:17.408 --> 21:17.568
No.

21:17.589 --> 21:20.211
A book about gangsters would have that kind of an impact?

21:20.231 --> 21:20.411
No.

21:20.511 --> 21:21.592
I knew it would make money.

21:22.373 --> 21:28.339
But I think, I thought maybe it would make a hundred grand, which is a fortune.

21:29.399 --> 21:31.742
I didn't know that all this was going to happen.

21:31.762 --> 21:40.052
In fact, I used to think, why this book has distinguished from other books?

21:40.092 --> 21:45.318
Why would this book make so much money, sell so many copies?

21:46.159 --> 21:47.901
This was before the movie came out.

21:48.282 --> 21:50.865
It wasn't like the movie sold the book.

21:50.905 --> 21:56.031
One of a few cases where a movie absolutely does justice to the book.

21:56.281 --> 22:01.045
I thought the first two movies were just... Well, the first movie I thought was terrific.

22:01.586 --> 22:03.888
But that was Francis Coppola, you know.

22:03.908 --> 22:08.992
That was his movie, and it was his talent that made that into such a movie.

22:09.893 --> 22:10.894
And also his courage.

22:10.914 --> 22:16.379
He had to do a lot of fighting to get the people he wanted, to do it the way he wanted.

22:17.260 --> 22:25.007
Well, but to go back, what do you think there is about that book that resonated so much?

22:25.027 --> 22:26.288
I think because it's a fairy tale.

22:26.926 --> 22:27.647
Really?

22:27.667 --> 22:28.989
An American theory, too.

22:31.052 --> 22:32.174
Yeah.

22:32.194 --> 22:33.977
It's a very romantic novel.

22:34.077 --> 22:36.781
It's a very family novel.

22:36.801 --> 22:42.690
I mean, I think of it as a family novel whose business happened to be against the law.

22:43.451 --> 22:46.896
Otherwise, the family values, the family problems, you know.

22:47.857 --> 22:51.563
This concept of giving people deals they can't refuse, is that something you made up?

22:51.623 --> 22:54.107
No, that's something I made up.

22:54.127 --> 22:54.908
Because it makes perfect sense.

22:55.192 --> 22:57.535
No, also, it's funny.

22:57.855 --> 23:01.741
You know, when you're writing a book, you're trying to have fun, too.

23:01.761 --> 23:04.664
You know, you have your own private jokes, you know, in the book.

23:05.946 --> 23:08.950
And that struck me as a very funny idea, you know.

23:10.973 --> 23:12.515
So that's the way it worked out.

23:12.655 --> 23:16.540
And in this book, you have the communion and the... I made that up, too.

23:16.620 --> 23:18.322
That makes perfect sense, too.

23:18.402 --> 23:18.743
Yeah.

23:18.783 --> 23:22.067
There are cases, like in Jimmy Hoffa, where you want them to disappear.

23:22.087 --> 23:22.407
Right.

23:22.427 --> 23:23.629
There are other cases where...

23:23.930 --> 23:28.495
So you invent something to give it a little more jazz, you know.

23:29.075 --> 23:32.819
I mean, do you have any technical experts, any people that are... No.

23:32.919 --> 23:35.041
And by technical experts, I mean monsters.

23:35.061 --> 23:42.168
Actually, from the research, they weren't smart enough to do some of the things they had to do.

23:42.969 --> 23:44.751
You mean the monsters?

23:44.771 --> 23:46.373
I had to make them smarter than they were.

23:47.334 --> 23:49.315
You mean the Godfather and this book as well?

23:49.656 --> 23:49.836
Yeah.

23:52.988 --> 23:55.611
From there, I got it from the old Sassanian guys.

23:55.631 --> 23:56.713
They were that smart.

23:56.733 --> 23:58.194
They were?

23:58.214 --> 23:58.315
Yeah.

23:58.335 --> 24:02.900
I mean, the way you set up the hit on the guy that killed the girl out in the post.

24:05.003 --> 24:05.243
Yeah.

24:05.323 --> 24:06.385
Are you much of a rewriter?

24:06.405 --> 24:07.506
Do you do a lot of revisions?

24:07.526 --> 24:07.706
Oh, yeah.

24:08.868 --> 24:14.675
In fact, my first dress of a book is so terrible that I would never show it anymore.

24:14.695 --> 24:14.975
Really?

24:15.256 --> 24:20.362
By the time John got to see any copy, I must have rewritten it about five times.

24:20.382 --> 24:22.084
It's an automatic process because

24:22.756 --> 24:29.205
To get into the move to work, I usually read all the pages I've written, up to that date, you know?

24:32.630 --> 24:34.412
When's your best, when's your primary time?

24:34.593 --> 24:34.913
Morning?

24:35.374 --> 24:37.357
Does it matter?

24:37.377 --> 24:39.459
I go in the streets.

24:40.681 --> 24:43.425
If I'm hot on the book, I work every day, every hour.

24:43.625 --> 24:47.611
You know, I hang around and typewriter.

24:47.711 --> 24:50.515
And you do work on a manual typewriter, I guess, right?

24:50.535 --> 24:52.257
None of this work process?

24:52.277 --> 24:52.678
No.

24:52.996 --> 24:53.957
No modern stuff.

24:54.117 --> 24:56.640
I can't remember.

24:56.740 --> 24:59.383
Are you one of these perfectionists who likes clean copy?

24:59.583 --> 24:59.763
No.

25:00.004 --> 25:00.764
Very sloppy.

25:00.945 --> 25:03.848
So if you screw up a page, you don't necessarily pull it away.

25:03.868 --> 25:06.771
I'll put this through the computer for me.

25:06.951 --> 25:07.191
I see.

25:07.272 --> 25:09.254
Tell them how the couch figures in your writing.

25:09.274 --> 25:09.674
The what?

25:09.774 --> 25:11.396
Tell them how the couch figures in your writing.

25:12.177 --> 25:13.138
Oh, my wife?

25:13.538 --> 25:14.179
No, the couch.

25:14.379 --> 25:14.860
The couch.

25:15.000 --> 25:15.601
Your couch.

25:16.662 --> 25:18.224
The couch at your house, apparently.

25:18.244 --> 25:18.644
Is that right?

25:18.924 --> 25:22.328
Yeah, you told me that you lie down on your couch, you stare at the ceiling,

25:23.067 --> 25:24.529
And that's it.

25:25.130 --> 25:27.854
My wife used to say she never saw me work.

25:27.894 --> 25:29.697
She never saw me science.

25:31.400 --> 25:36.568
Well, there's a wonderful old New Yorker cartoon, which is a sugar guy in a hammock, and his wife is standing there.

25:36.588 --> 25:38.831
He says, listen, a writer isn't always writing when he's writing.

25:39.372 --> 25:40.153
And I think that's true.

25:40.253 --> 25:42.817
Do you ever wake up in the morning with solutions to problems?

25:42.837 --> 25:43.398
Oh, sure.

25:43.598 --> 25:46.984
When something's really bugging you about how you're resolving a certain situation?

25:47.004 --> 25:50.509
I mean, I'm...

25:51.434 --> 25:54.116
In the morning, the first thing I have to do is read the papers.

25:54.136 --> 25:59.121
I read the Times, and I read the News, have my breakfast, read the papers.

25:59.321 --> 26:02.724
It takes a couple of hours, and then I try to work.

26:03.805 --> 26:06.367
When I'm going good, I have no patience.

26:06.428 --> 26:07.989
I don't read the papers.

26:08.009 --> 26:09.530
I work before I read the papers.

26:10.051 --> 26:13.754
That's a sign that I'm working very well.

26:14.074 --> 26:16.016
Do you see these things whole?

26:16.096 --> 26:18.218
Did you have an idea of what this book was?

26:18.238 --> 26:20.260
Is this one of these things that revealed itself to you?

26:20.611 --> 26:26.296
In all my books, you write, and as you write, things come to you.

26:26.696 --> 26:36.605
You think out some things sometimes, but really the best stuff comes when you sit down at the top while you're writing something else, or something else you think of.

26:36.625 --> 26:38.767
It's a mystery to me.

26:39.428 --> 26:44.572
When I finish a book, I wonder, how did I fill out those pages of humor?

26:44.592 --> 26:46.194
You know what I mean?

26:46.214 --> 26:48.576
It's really, really a mystery.

26:49.535 --> 26:52.759
All of a sudden, there's 700, 800 pages of manuscript.

26:52.859 --> 26:54.401
I have no idea how you got there.

26:54.421 --> 26:55.623
Do you like a nice big book?

26:55.723 --> 26:57.766
Do you like big, fat books?

26:58.787 --> 27:01.190
Yeah, I like room.

27:03.873 --> 27:11.283
I would love someday to write one little short, two before, since, you know, like 200 pages, you know.

27:13.125 --> 27:15.588
But so far, I haven't been able to do it.

27:15.608 --> 27:16.389
So what's in the works?

27:16.430 --> 27:17.651
What are you thinking of?

27:17.951 --> 27:19.153
Even worse, I'm thinking of

27:19.825 --> 27:25.493
writing a mafia novel that extends through the 1300s when it started to now.

27:25.793 --> 27:27.535
You're kidding.

27:27.635 --> 27:36.988
Well, are you going to do research for this, or is it going to be... Well, I'll have to do some extra research, but the early history of the mafia is fascinating.

27:39.231 --> 27:43.397
But how to put it into fiction is a problem, you know, to make a novel.

27:43.417 --> 27:47.742
Well, a lot of this is, I mean, there certainly is enough published material on this.

27:47.762 --> 27:48.904
Oh, yeah.

27:49.154 --> 27:53.560
There's a big literature on the ground.

27:53.580 --> 27:57.165
That's a pet word of yours, I think, the literature on the subject.

27:57.225 --> 28:00.529
Yeah, because it is a literature, you know.

28:00.629 --> 28:07.879
I read something that you're a voracious reader, because I'm a boxer.

28:08.319 --> 28:13.486
My passion, I'm just curious, does your reading influence your writing at all?

28:13.546 --> 28:18.132
It used to be, when I was trying to finish a novel, I'd try to keep books out of my house.

28:19.023 --> 28:23.048
that would keep me from writing, but I don't have to do that anymore.

28:23.349 --> 28:30.218
I've got enough discipline where the reading, I think, doesn't interfere with my writing.

28:30.238 --> 28:30.839
What do you read?

28:30.939 --> 28:33.142
Do you read other novelists?

28:33.302 --> 28:34.684
Do you read history?

28:34.744 --> 28:36.627
I read everything practically.

28:36.647 --> 28:37.408
Or try to read everything.

28:37.548 --> 28:38.790
Tell them how many books a year you buy.

28:39.791 --> 28:40.011
Huh?

28:40.151 --> 28:41.313
Tell them how many books a year you buy.

28:41.553 --> 28:45.358
Oh, I know I spend over 10 grand, 15 grand a year on books.

28:45.378 --> 28:45.659
Really?

28:45.939 --> 28:48.102
So I would come out to about 500 books, I think.

28:48.993 --> 28:49.854
You're kidding.

28:49.874 --> 28:52.398
Do you go to bookstores or do you have somebody go get them for you?

28:52.959 --> 28:54.321
Sometimes I go to the bookstores.

28:54.341 --> 28:56.885
Sometimes I make out with somebody else.

28:56.985 --> 28:59.248
Oh, new books or do you like secondhand books?

28:59.269 --> 29:00.190
No, new books.

29:00.390 --> 29:02.994
Because I love secondhand bookstores.

29:03.074 --> 29:03.635
I used to.

29:03.855 --> 29:05.238
I used to love secondhand.

29:05.979 --> 29:12.529
But now, um, you get rich, you buy books.

29:13.250 --> 29:13.911
It took me one time.

29:13.931 --> 29:14.832
I just wrote a book about

29:15.166 --> 29:17.790
That's why I'm interested in that.

29:18.310 --> 29:20.133
Yeah, but I don't bribe them to keep them.

29:20.273 --> 29:24.659
I'll keep a book if I really love it, because I'll reread it.

29:26.722 --> 29:33.291
I've read McMurtry's Lonesome Doug at least two or four times.

29:33.311 --> 29:35.374
It's such a pleasure to read.

29:35.394 --> 29:38.018
You read it like as a carpenter might study

29:38.555 --> 29:48.646
the workmanship, are you reading it as a fellow professional looking at how it's done, are you reading it?

29:49.167 --> 29:54.452
You learn tricks with the other guy, how he solves problems.

29:54.572 --> 30:00.419
I think critics don't really talk enough about the craft.

30:00.439 --> 30:04.603
There's a lot of conflict for you, you know?

30:04.623 --> 30:07.887
Well, I have to say, I'm pretty good at figuring out where things are going.

30:08.558 --> 30:15.088
and I'll never give this away in my piece, but you got me in that last little thing with the old guy.

30:15.328 --> 30:18.093
I didn't see it coming either.

30:18.113 --> 30:19.194
I didn't know what he was going to do.

30:19.215 --> 30:20.837
He absolutely suckered me on that one.

30:21.698 --> 30:23.722
That's what you're trying to do all the time.

30:23.782 --> 30:27.347
And that's where the title, by the way, is absolutely perfect.

30:27.367 --> 30:28.048
It makes sense.

30:28.128 --> 30:31.754
I said, shit, he's not the last one.

30:32.094 --> 30:32.715
But he was.

30:32.735 --> 30:36.321
He set it up and he actually sanctioned in his own way

30:37.246 --> 30:52.568
knocking off Dante because Dante was a menace, and this guy was bad for business and bad for the plan to assimilate themselves into the general society, so he absolutely sanctioned that in a way.

30:52.608 --> 30:57.194
Now, I would say clearly that you set yourself up for a sequel here.

30:57.214 --> 31:02.882
I mean, you've got characters in place, and Cross is a young enough man, and he's got money.

31:03.284 --> 31:07.288
And I don't think he's going to be working with this autistic child for his entire life.

31:07.308 --> 31:23.645
I mean, I have to feel that at some point... Well, I had a scene that I had to cut out of the book because John, Paul, well, I don't think I thought... There was a scene where Cross was... Well, I don't want to be explicit, but if she's signaling me, I shouldn't tell you.

31:24.766 --> 31:25.527
I won't use it.

31:25.547 --> 31:27.329
I'd sure like to know.

31:28.570 --> 31:28.870
Tell us.

31:28.890 --> 31:29.831
I mean, he won't use it.

31:30.632 --> 31:30.933
I won't use it.

31:30.953 --> 31:31.333
You can trust me.

31:32.039 --> 31:33.841
What do you say?

31:37.044 --> 31:40.768
He's got an Italian name.

31:41.189 --> 31:44.252
He's trustworthy.

31:45.153 --> 31:48.276
I'm Greek, actually, but that's okay.

31:50.178 --> 31:56.665
But I wanted to have a scene at the end where Athena tells Cross, I know what you're thinking.

31:57.146 --> 32:00.570
If my daughter doesn't get better, you'll kill her so you can have me all for yourself.

32:00.730 --> 32:01.911
Don't do that, because I won't

32:02.363 --> 32:09.834
And I'll say it right on my tape, I won't use it, I promise.

32:10.214 --> 32:13.519
And he said, he thinks it all, he says, okay, I promise I won't kill it.

32:14.881 --> 32:17.926
It's just like a... It's a proof.

32:18.246 --> 32:25.857
You know, people don't want to read that, you know, where... I think you were correct to take it out, actually.

32:26.410 --> 32:34.098
Over there, both told me I'd be crazy if I... His character, you've really got, he's a very empathetic character.

32:34.719 --> 32:34.859
Yeah.

32:34.879 --> 32:46.832
But still, in real life, he would have given... Well, in real life, would he have paid a $250 million ransom to save the other guy's life, too?

32:46.932 --> 32:47.753
I wonder.

32:47.853 --> 32:52.738
That's why I say I'm a romantic guy.

32:53.157 --> 33:10.778
The reason I didn't think it was even necessary was because I felt that that menace was implied, especially in the scene where Cross and Athena are together, and Cross thinks that Athena may have killed her daughter, and Athena thinks that Cross has probably killed her daughter.

33:11.382 --> 33:20.095
So they both think they're capable of murder, and yet they're both in love with each other.

33:20.115 --> 33:22.498
And so I didn't think he needed to go any further.

33:22.578 --> 33:26.484
And plus also, she, as she says, she arranged for the hit.

33:27.105 --> 33:27.766
She set it up.

33:28.306 --> 33:31.551
She basically, she engaged him.

33:31.868 --> 33:35.014
And she knew instantly, she said, that he was going to take care of it.

33:36.256 --> 33:42.487
He did it in the fourth case, too, where a president of the United States allows an atomic bomb foa.

33:42.747 --> 33:49.038
It's this very subtle psychological, and it's all about crossing that ethical line.

33:49.379 --> 33:52.124
And that is, of course, American values.

33:52.224 --> 33:56.391
I mean, you are a very patriotic American, and your character is

33:56.675 --> 33:58.678
in their own bizarre way.

33:59.980 --> 34:12.857
I mean, that is ever so clear when it's apparent that they can legalize sportsbook, you know, gambling and professional sports if they knock off the president.

34:12.877 --> 34:13.659
But are you kidding?

34:13.679 --> 34:14.480
This is outrageous.

34:14.540 --> 34:16.462
We're Americans, for God's sake.

34:16.482 --> 34:19.587
I mean, who do you think we are, traitors?

34:19.747 --> 34:20.127
You know?

34:20.168 --> 34:24.133
Well, they were very patriotic, one of those guys.

34:24.721 --> 34:29.426
But I mean, there is a system of values that they embody, isn't there?

34:29.666 --> 34:30.547
I think.

34:32.269 --> 34:32.809
Let's see.

34:33.230 --> 34:34.651
We haven't even talked about it.

34:34.691 --> 34:35.792
Now, you're a New Yorker, right?

34:36.153 --> 34:43.680
But yet you know this Hollywood and Las Vegas world so exquisitely well, I think.

34:44.141 --> 34:51.048
And one wonders, when you profile these Hollywood people, you know, who the biggest crooks are, you know?

34:51.188 --> 34:53.230
Are they the one?

34:53.330 --> 34:54.171
I mean, it's...

34:54.387 --> 35:00.094
Do you, in fact, have contempt for a lot of these movie people?

35:00.254 --> 35:02.817
I don't know whether the right word is contempt.

35:02.837 --> 35:12.229
I think I'm sort of amazed by it, if you will.

35:12.249 --> 35:16.093
You know, again, I've had a good time in Hollywood.

35:16.113 --> 35:18.216
I've made some good friends out there.

35:19.197 --> 35:23.162
But essentially, the business itself...

35:28.154 --> 35:32.959
is really so cold-blooded.

35:33.139 --> 35:41.427
I mean, you get the feeling that no matter what, you have to have a lawyer.

35:42.549 --> 35:48.174
I mean, if you're going to marry somebody, you've got to have a good lawyer.

35:48.194 --> 35:50.917
If you have a deal with somebody, you've got to have a good lawyer.

35:51.398 --> 35:56.743
If you're best friends to somebody, you have to have a document saying, this is my best friend, you know.

35:56.926 --> 36:03.274
It's like a very uneasy atmosphere, for me anyway.

36:07.179 --> 36:11.544
I read someplace, and I may even use the line myself, I mean, these are two cities.

36:11.644 --> 36:15.910
One, you make a lot of money in one, and you loose it in the other.

36:16.871 --> 36:19.214
That's a cute little observation.

36:19.234 --> 36:21.617
And the villains, I guess,

36:21.867 --> 36:27.395
Are they designed on any particular, are they modeled on any particular casino that has villas like that?

36:27.735 --> 36:29.718
Well, you don't have villas like that.

36:31.781 --> 36:35.647
Well, first, at the Beverly Hills Hotel, they had their bungalows.

36:35.807 --> 36:45.822
In Vegas, Steve Wynn's place, the Mirage, they had these special bungalows.

36:45.842 --> 36:48.125
They reserved for very high rollers.

36:48.145 --> 36:50.288
You can't rent them or anything.

36:50.757 --> 36:55.163
He has his own private golf course with these high rolls, you know.

36:55.183 --> 37:00.069
So, what I did was just a hint of what, you know, goes on.

37:00.790 --> 37:01.931
You did give a few tips.

37:01.991 --> 37:07.158
I mean, I've gone to a few casinos myself, and there are some tips to gamblers here.

37:07.178 --> 37:07.959
Yeah.

37:07.979 --> 37:10.402
Don't gamble for more than two hours at a time.

37:10.522 --> 37:11.724
Oh, yeah, that's standard.

37:11.744 --> 37:16.410
Don't press your bets when you're getting hit and killed.

37:16.610 --> 37:18.993
Too bad I couldn't take it myself.

37:19.113 --> 37:19.714
This is a problem.

37:19.734 --> 37:21.597
Would you mind about the handicapped in gambling?

37:22.037 --> 37:22.278
Huh?

37:22.678 --> 37:28.426
About the handicapped in gambling, they feel that, you know, God owes them one or something so that they gamble more?

37:28.706 --> 37:29.387
Oh, yeah, yeah.

37:29.407 --> 37:31.270
What was that?

37:32.712 --> 37:33.913
Handicapped people.

37:34.494 --> 37:36.337
You see more wheelchairs in Vegas.

37:37.518 --> 37:39.801
Because they feel they've got something coming to them.

37:41.143 --> 37:46.110
God has been so terrible to them by taking off their legs or something.

37:47.052 --> 37:49.295
It's surely who we pay them at the table.

37:49.315 --> 37:50.136
Never happens.

37:50.156 --> 37:50.977
No.

37:50.997 --> 38:04.335
I've been at the tables and you see some guy come in, a black guy or a Hispanic guy, you know, who's out of Atlantic City, and the guy will take out his last $5 bill, you know, and he'll buy a chip.

38:04.355 --> 38:08.200
And, you know, the story would be, he parlays this, you know.

38:08.737 --> 38:10.920
7-0, you know, straight away.

38:11.281 --> 38:12.523
He's gone.

38:12.763 --> 38:14.866
I'm against gambling casinos now.

38:14.886 --> 38:16.328
You know, like a true hypocrite.

38:16.348 --> 38:22.217
When you get older, you reject your vices on the behalf of everyone, you know.

38:22.477 --> 38:23.378
Really?

38:23.398 --> 38:24.200
Is that right?

38:24.220 --> 38:24.380
Yeah.

38:24.941 --> 38:29.247
They've gone too far with the casinos, with the lotteries.

38:30.048 --> 38:31.110
What's your game of choice?

38:31.130 --> 38:33.113
You mentioned Baccarat in here.

38:33.193 --> 38:35.396
Actually, I love Loretta in any of the games.

38:35.937 --> 38:36.538
Really?

38:36.558 --> 38:38.220
And I've been luckier at Loretta.

38:38.538 --> 38:40.541
What time is the next time?

38:42.143 --> 38:44.907
He's been at 4.

38:44.927 --> 38:45.127
Okay.

38:45.588 --> 38:46.749
Well, you can help him out.

38:46.849 --> 38:48.071
What is it?

38:49.173 --> 38:52.157
I've got, you know, again, this is icing on the cake for me.

38:54.420 --> 38:54.660
It is.

38:54.740 --> 38:58.746
Let me just ask you one quick question.

38:58.766 --> 39:00.789
I've interviewed Peter Benchley, you know, in the past.

39:00.849 --> 39:06.516
Of course, one of the things is after he wrote Jaws, everybody was out to kill sharks.

39:06.536 --> 39:07.718
You know, I mean, sharks...

39:08.069 --> 39:24.611
And I wonder if, in a similar kind of a way, if Italians are having to bear the cross as being identified, you know, every time you see somebody with a name that ends in a vowel, you know, there's the unfair assumption that they're connected in some way.

39:24.972 --> 39:26.434
I have to put up with it myself.

39:26.474 --> 39:27.635
A lot of people think I'm connected.

39:27.655 --> 39:29.918
But did it get happened because I'm the godfather?

39:30.058 --> 39:30.339
Right.

39:30.459 --> 39:31.520
That's right.

39:31.540 --> 39:33.723
That's one of the unhappy consequences.

39:33.743 --> 39:36.006
Yeah, but it's all bullshit anyway.

39:36.046 --> 39:36.507
I mean...

39:37.887 --> 39:39.650
It's not relevant to a writer.

39:39.670 --> 39:42.494
I mean, you can't worry about that.

39:42.594 --> 39:46.500
And then also, these books are written in a very visual way.

39:46.901 --> 39:50.366
Also, they're wonderful people these patterns.

39:50.486 --> 39:51.728
They cook good food.

39:51.748 --> 39:52.569
They have good music.

39:52.610 --> 39:53.932
They have a good time.

39:53.972 --> 39:57.757
They have respect for their elders.

39:57.777 --> 39:59.740
I mean, what more do you want from the people?

40:00.401 --> 40:02.304
They're in a rough business, that's all.

40:02.985 --> 40:04.047
That's a wonderful one.

40:04.533 --> 40:06.635
That's almost the kicker to my piece.

40:06.815 --> 40:09.899
I've always got my lead, and I'm always looking for my kicker.

40:09.919 --> 40:12.041
You just gave me the kicker.

40:13.462 --> 40:15.044
Were you thinking movies, though?

40:15.064 --> 40:18.287
Because you've had a lot of experience in film.

40:18.307 --> 40:21.150
What do you mean, when I was writing this book?

40:21.170 --> 40:21.931
This book, yeah.

40:21.951 --> 40:24.113
I was pretty sure this would be both a film.

40:24.374 --> 40:26.856
But I mean, when you were writing it, were you thinking visually?

40:26.876 --> 40:27.317
Not particularly.

40:27.357 --> 40:28.638
I certainly see scenes here.

40:28.658 --> 40:31.021
It's not going to be that hard to adapt this thing to the screen.

40:31.061 --> 40:32.262
I may have consciously written some

40:34.013 --> 40:36.200
cinematic themes on this book.

40:36.220 --> 40:38.447
I don't know whether I did or not, but maybe I did.

40:39.450 --> 40:41.015
I don't know.

40:41.035 --> 40:41.878
I've got plenty of stuff.

40:41.898 --> 40:43.865
Would you inscribe a couple of books for me?

40:43.925 --> 40:45.289
Sure, I will.
