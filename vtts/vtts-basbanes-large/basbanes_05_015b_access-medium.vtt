WEBVTT

00:01.178 --> 00:03.160
We're rolling and we're talking to Nora Keller.

00:03.181 --> 00:09.468
Why don't we just dispense with the, the first question must always be that, you know, how much of this is biographical?

00:10.610 --> 00:11.651
I've read a few features.

00:12.853 --> 00:16.077
Part of this is inspired by a woman that you covered as a news story.

00:16.097 --> 00:17.719
Is that right or something like that?

00:17.739 --> 00:21.604
Well, I had just gone out to hear a lecture at the University of Hawaii.

00:21.624 --> 00:22.765
The speaker was a Korean.

00:22.745 --> 00:50.119
woman who had survived their comfort camps during World War II and her name was Kim Jon Hwang. So she gave a little bit about her experience in the camps and what she was speaking out about was that she wanted people to know that these camps existed. This was in the you know early 90s when a lot of people hadn't heard about what had gone on and it was before the Japanese government offered their apology so she was speaking out to let people know what had happened and to try to get the Japanese government to acknowledge

00:50.285 --> 00:52.769
the existence of the camps and to apologize for them.

00:53.169 --> 00:54.531
And how well had she adjusted?

00:54.551 --> 00:58.177
I mean, your character, of course, doesn't cope very well with this experience at all.

00:58.197 --> 01:00.059
How had this particular, this actual woman?

01:00.680 --> 01:08.752
She did that off her personal life, but she did say that she, after she left her camp as a young woman, she never went back to see her family.

01:09.333 --> 01:12.137
She just felt like she can't fight in her shame and go over a cat.

01:12.758 --> 01:15.643
Go back to see anybody in her family.

01:15.663 --> 01:16.464
That might be a story.

01:16.484 --> 01:17.305
And she's going to have family with her.

01:17.740 --> 01:26.933
Now, you, of course, being, uh, uh, uh, Canadian ancestry and heritage, uh, uh, I, uh, I gather, I mean, is this, uh, tell me about the various factors that came into play to that occasion in the writing of this book?

01:26.953 --> 01:44.018
As I heard, in your homespeed, I was so off, you know, at a deep level that I started dreaming about, about her, I had dreams about it, and I had images of the camp, I had images of war, and just really, um, horrible flashes of, um, maybe I had my dreams, and so one night I,

01:44.318 --> 02:07.643
So they're like that research aspect of the book that came into town.

02:07.910 --> 02:14.743
And there's also some bits and pieces of my life growing up in Hawaii as a Korean-American, so there's a piece of people that I know.

02:15.685 --> 02:18.450
And in the end, I don't know who was the woman who went through the chaos.

02:18.470 --> 02:19.692
She's not really based on anyone's person.

02:19.792 --> 02:21.055
She's more of a composite of people.

02:21.395 --> 02:22.678
But she said she's inspired by the woman.

02:22.858 --> 02:23.439
Oh, definitely.

02:23.579 --> 02:24.000
What?

02:24.040 --> 02:29.310
She was the... Yeah, she did this while in... Was she 12 as well in the sun?

02:33.408 --> 02:42.784
And were they sold, actually, or they just taken?

02:43.365 --> 02:46.250
Amazing.

02:46.350 --> 02:58.251
Well, you have this, of course, as for you, too.

02:58.619 --> 02:59.944
I'm making a novel.

02:59.964 --> 03:01.329
That's a great story.

03:01.671 --> 03:02.253
I did this.

03:02.273 --> 03:03.016
I come from my dreams as well.

03:03.036 --> 03:03.518
I did this.

03:03.999 --> 03:06.228
The dreams, you know, I guess.

03:06.248 --> 03:42.514
[Scratched record.]

03:45.937 --> 03:49.861
Okay, here we go.

03:49.901 --> 03:51.022
We're taping again.

03:51.403 --> 03:52.183
Okay.

03:52.203 --> 03:52.544
I'm sorry.

03:52.564 --> 03:52.924
Go ahead.

03:53.585 --> 03:54.406
We were talking.

03:56.208 --> 03:58.150
I think that was it.

03:58.170 --> 04:02.954
So that I was able to imagine the daily life as I can.

04:05.697 --> 04:07.659
Your background, this is your first novel.

04:07.940 --> 04:08.500
Yes.

04:09.441 --> 04:11.143
Did you train to be a novelist?

04:11.223 --> 04:12.064
No.

04:12.084 --> 04:15.167
I had no idea what I was doing for that.

04:15.147 --> 04:26.202
You know, and that's why, I mean, when I first heard this woman speak at the university, I, you know, my first reaction was like, oh my goodness, this story needs to be heard.

04:26.322 --> 04:28.004
Somebody needs to write about this story.

04:28.305 --> 04:29.726
You know, I was saying somebody, somebody.

04:29.787 --> 04:30.868
I wasn't saying me.

04:31.509 --> 04:35.094
But you were thinking in terms of a factual, non-fictional treatment.

04:35.154 --> 04:35.594
Is that right?

04:35.694 --> 04:40.080
I was just thinking of, actually, I was thinking that it was a story that needed to be heard in many forms.

04:40.621 --> 04:41.442
And I thought, oh,

04:41.422 --> 04:44.425
I had wondered why I hadn't heard it non-fiction.

04:44.566 --> 04:56.039
I also knew that it should be talked about fictionally too because through fiction we can get the emotions, we can get another side of the story.

04:56.800 --> 05:03.968
And I had written short stories so I was thinking about fiction a lot too.

05:04.428 --> 05:08.593
But I wasn't thinking that I should be the one to write about this at all because

05:08.573 --> 05:14.041
You know, up to that point, I had just done, you know, short stories.

05:14.101 --> 05:18.066
I had done some book reviews for the newspaper.

05:18.146 --> 05:20.549
I had done, you know, bits and pieces of things.

05:20.569 --> 05:25.837
So, you know, I wouldn't have thought that I would be able to write a novel.

05:26.438 --> 05:27.319
First time.

05:27.339 --> 05:27.619
I know.

05:27.659 --> 05:31.945
I really, and I didn't know how to do it or how to structure it.

05:32.506 --> 05:37.753
So at the beginning, I had to think of each chapter as kind of like a story in itself.

05:38.240 --> 05:45.106
so that it was only about two-thirds through that I began to work with the whole structure of the novel.

05:45.126 --> 05:47.728
You know, up until then I was just taking chunks of it.

05:48.369 --> 05:54.994
At what point did you think, I mean, attempting alternate points of view is not exactly, I mean, that's kind of an advanced technique.

05:55.415 --> 05:57.116
I read a lot.

05:58.257 --> 05:58.958
I've read a lot.

05:58.978 --> 06:03.682
You know, I'm a voracious reader so that, I guess, if anything, that would be my training.

06:04.202 --> 06:07.605
And I think that's anybody's training to write, you know.

06:07.872 --> 06:10.496
I bet you jump around with tenses and stuff, too.

06:10.596 --> 06:13.259
It's a pretty ambitious structure.

06:13.300 --> 06:17.626
And I also understand that you belong to a writer's group.

06:17.646 --> 06:18.126
Is that right?

06:18.306 --> 06:18.787
I do.

06:18.887 --> 06:24.034
And so I would get a chapter done, and we belong to a monthly group.

06:24.135 --> 06:29.883
So each month I would say, OK, I need to get a draft of this chapter done so I can show it to the group.

06:30.483 --> 06:34.849
And so that kind of gave me a timeline or a date to work with.

06:34.869 --> 06:36.732
And then I would bring it to the group, and they'd

06:37.117 --> 06:43.363
give me comments and I go home and rework the chapter and then start the new one, the new chapter.

06:43.630 --> 06:45.111
How's the group done as a rule?

06:45.152 --> 06:48.375
Have they gotten many things published out of it?

06:48.715 --> 06:50.717
Oh, they're just, you know, it's so tremendous.

06:50.737 --> 06:52.539
They're just such a wonderful group of writers.

06:52.719 --> 07:01.348
And yes, there's Loisan Yamanaka, whose third book and second novel just came out this month.

07:01.528 --> 07:01.828
Really?

07:02.208 --> 07:05.171
Yeah, and there's... What's the title of that?

07:05.352 --> 07:06.172
Blue's Hanging.

07:06.993 --> 07:07.754
And who published it?

07:08.154 --> 07:09.075
Farrar Strauss.

07:09.095 --> 07:09.476
Oh, really?

07:09.616 --> 07:11.798
Yeah, and it's just such a great book, I mean, right?

07:11.778 --> 07:12.820
Well, great.

07:13.661 --> 07:16.747
In fact, we got to read together in New York.

07:17.889 --> 07:19.372
Well, that must have been interesting.

07:20.994 --> 07:33.617
Yeah, that was... Do you see yourself as a... I hesitate to use the expression a regional writer, but, you know, we do have wonderful regional...

07:34.036 --> 07:37.260
bodies of work in the United States.

07:37.300 --> 07:43.167
Do you see yourself as a Hawaiian writer, a Korean-American writer, a women's writer?

07:43.187 --> 07:45.530
How do you see yourself?

07:46.150 --> 07:46.951
Emerging from what?

07:47.392 --> 07:49.635
I actually see myself as all of those.

07:50.075 --> 07:54.721
I'm of two minds with the labels or the categories.

07:55.181 --> 07:58.285
On the one hand, I'm very proud to be a writer from Hawaii.

07:58.305 --> 08:00.988
I'm proud to be a Korean-American writer.

08:00.968 --> 08:05.134
I'm proud to be, you know, a woman writer, you know, so all of those things.

08:05.375 --> 08:09.821
And I really see them as sources of strength in my writing.

08:10.522 --> 08:26.807
And, you know, and there's, you know, but, you know, however the category is, I also recognize that in a sense that, you know, whatever the category is, it's kind of superficial in the way that it doesn't affect what I write.

08:28.238 --> 08:28.979
Does that make sense?

08:29.019 --> 08:30.520
Yeah, of course it does, yeah.

08:30.540 --> 08:32.102
Yeah, and so I write what I write.

08:32.142 --> 08:44.353
And so it's interesting, in a way, to see all the different categories that it comes up in, all the different ways that people label my writing in terms of just how they talk about it.

08:45.494 --> 08:57.705
On the other hand, it worries me that if somebody thinks of my book as, oh, that's just a Korean-American

08:57.685 --> 09:09.234
that's a Korean-American book or that's an Asian-American book or that other people might feel like, oh, I, you know, might not feel like they have access to the book, that it doesn't connect to them in any way.

09:10.116 --> 09:12.943
Same if people, I've heard people say, oh, that's a woman's book.

09:12.923 --> 09:15.650
Well, I think that would be the biggest threat, actually.

09:15.690 --> 09:28.705
Not so much Korean-American, but that, because let's face it, Amy Tan has millions of readers and has no problem living with the...

09:28.685 --> 09:48.010
But I think the question of being a book for women, you know, is something you might have to defend because, you know, in terms of male, the male characters, it's awfully hard to find any men in there that you'd be pleased to call your friend, you know.

09:47.990 --> 10:02.732
I know, and I realize that because I'm writing from the perspective of these two women who are just in very specific circumstances, you know, like Akiko's certainly not going to have, you know, fond feelings toward men of any, you know.

10:02.892 --> 10:04.054
Even the missionary, you know.

10:04.074 --> 10:04.835
Yeah, anybody.

10:04.895 --> 10:06.117
I mean, just that whole...

10:06.097 --> 10:16.750
She feels totally disconnected to everybody, men, but also women too, and it's only her daughter that provides any link to the living for her.

10:16.770 --> 10:17.952
It's the only thing that she loves.

10:18.432 --> 10:31.969
So, I mean, coming from that character and her specific circumstances and also how she's going to pass on those feelings about men toward her daughter, I mean, those two women are going to see men in a very particular way.

10:32.911 --> 10:35.915
So I totally recognize that in a sense.

10:35.936 --> 10:41.324
But I hate to think that men will feel like, oh, I can't read it or I won't.

10:41.344 --> 10:48.354
Well, let's face it, it's going to have to be recommended to them, and they'll respond to it.

10:49.015 --> 10:50.097
Have you heard from any men?

10:50.357 --> 10:51.859
You know, that's what's been so great.

10:51.899 --> 10:57.788
I mean, I think that's one of the best parts about going on this tour and doing readings at the workshop because

10:58.173 --> 11:00.637
I get to meet people who are actually reading it.

11:00.857 --> 11:13.798
And when I first went out and I was told, oh, this is a book that will appeal to women, you know, primarily, but I've gone out and I've gone to different bookstores and I see that there's quite a large percentage of men there too.

11:13.818 --> 11:17.724
So, you know, it makes me feel relieved in the sense that men are reading it.

11:17.744 --> 11:21.230
Do you have a sense of the reader?

11:21.771 --> 11:25.176
Did you have a sense of the reader when you were writing it or were you writing for yourself?

11:26.455 --> 11:38.902
I was writing for myself, but the people that I really felt like I was writing for was one, my mother, and one for my young daughter, who's just three now.

11:38.922 --> 11:39.523
That's great.

11:39.804 --> 11:42.810
But for the woman that I hope that she'll become, you know.

11:43.313 --> 11:44.755
that I envision her one day.

11:45.356 --> 11:50.143
And so, but you know, the whole irony is neither one of them can read it at this moment, you know?

11:50.984 --> 11:58.274
Well, but you have them in your... Yeah, but those are the people foremost in my mind while I was writing this particular book.

11:58.294 --> 12:00.717
At what point did you hear the voices of the women?

12:00.737 --> 12:01.779
Did you hear the voices?

12:02.199 --> 12:05.524
Did they establish their voices as characters?

12:05.673 --> 12:07.896
Akiko was very early on.

12:07.996 --> 12:13.684
I mean, you know, I think she was kind of in... She actually was narrating my dreams at a certain point.

12:13.844 --> 12:14.225
Really?

12:14.746 --> 12:16.228
Yeah, I mean, I heard her very strong.

12:16.608 --> 12:23.158
So I wrote all her chapters first without really knowing how I would place them in order.

12:23.919 --> 12:33.452
And then after I got Akiko's done, and I knew I wanted to have a daughter, and when I got to Becca's voice...

12:34.867 --> 12:40.058
Yeah, she came early, but I saw her as almost a response to the mother's chanters.

12:40.760 --> 12:49.138
Like, here's Akiko, the first generation, and this is how Becca responds or interacts with what has come before her.

12:51.884 --> 12:52.626
Very interesting.

12:52.646 --> 12:54.951
Are you working on another novel now?

12:55.319 --> 12:56.704
Yes, I am.

12:58.009 --> 13:06.460
I'm actually kind of playing with two different ideas for two different novels, and both of those two novels

13:06.592 --> 13:10.236
I do deal with Korean American issues, Korean American themes.

13:11.238 --> 13:20.569
I'm really interested in the process of immigration and how in immigration people change their identities.

13:20.629 --> 13:26.436
I mean, it's almost like it's a transformation of identity and how families become restructured.

13:26.476 --> 13:30.962
So I'm really interested in that whole.

13:30.942 --> 13:33.110
Of course, you talk about identities.

13:34.114 --> 13:39.815
Your character here, her name is taken from her.

13:40.478 --> 13:42.505
You talk about identity.

13:43.008 --> 13:48.815
what greater metaphor is there for identity than a name, you know?

13:49.055 --> 14:02.030
Yeah, and that's totally historically based, you know, like when the Japanese occupied Korea from 1910, I mean, that was one of the first things, you know, Japanese, I mean, no Korean names, no Korean language, customs.

14:03.292 --> 14:10.060
So you're right, that's really almost an attempt to squash that whole Korean identity.

14:10.761 --> 14:12.643
Now you say your mother can't read this?

14:12.708 --> 14:16.537
No, she can't read English very well.

14:18.462 --> 14:25.198
Unless it's translated, or unless I sit down and read it to her over a week or so.

14:25.735 --> 14:27.558
She won't be able to hear the story.

14:27.578 --> 14:28.580
So how is your Korean?

14:29.121 --> 14:30.443
My Korean is terrible.

14:30.463 --> 14:31.265
I mean, terrible.

14:32.287 --> 14:38.097
And I think that's, you know, when my mom came to the U.S.

14:38.357 --> 14:47.153
and we had settled in, actually, before coming to Hawaii, we were in, like, Minnesota and Florida and Ohio.

14:47.133 --> 15:00.424
She was very conscious of her accent of not being able to speak English, very conscious of her foreignness, and she saw that as a real liability.

15:00.605 --> 15:04.534
So she really made a decision not to teach me anything.

15:04.514 --> 15:05.696
Korean language.

15:05.756 --> 15:08.741
She didn't want me to be stigmatized in any way.

15:08.761 --> 15:09.663
It's too bad, isn't it?

15:09.683 --> 15:10.925
Yeah, it's just so sad.

15:11.245 --> 15:18.177
And that was like in the late 60s, early 1970s, so it really wasn't considered a plus to learn a second.

15:18.578 --> 15:26.711
Yeah, well, my parents are Greek, and I just wish I could speak, you know, and they didn't teach it to my brother or myself for the same precise reason.

15:26.731 --> 15:29.676
They wanted us to be perceived as Americans, you know.

15:29.997 --> 15:30.117
Right.

15:30.097 --> 15:31.460
And it really is sad.

15:31.520 --> 15:36.532
It is sad because I'm terrible at languages, and I couldn't learn it out if I tried.

15:37.655 --> 15:40.561
I wish I really had that language.

15:40.661 --> 15:44.210
Yeah, I really do feel kind of a sense of loss because of that.

15:44.430 --> 15:47.818
And maybe that's why I write, too, is to try to.

15:48.372 --> 15:52.621
reclaim some connection with Korean identity.

15:52.941 --> 15:53.943
But how about stories?

15:54.064 --> 15:55.907
Have the stories been passed on?

15:56.689 --> 16:02.080
Well, my mother and also my older brother told a lot of stories.

16:02.902 --> 16:09.435
And, you know, so like the folk tales in the book are actual Korean folk tales.

16:10.985 --> 16:17.936
Now, let's say you were not Korean-American and you still had witnessed this talk that this woman gave.

16:17.956 --> 16:22.944
Do you think you still would have been motivated to write about her?

16:23.105 --> 16:25.068
I mean, would you have been moved to the degree that you were?

16:26.831 --> 16:28.153
That's really hard to say.

16:28.173 --> 16:28.974
Interesting, isn't it?

16:29.756 --> 16:37.448
You certainly couldn't have written the same novel because it had to come from that Korean... I think that kind of that whole...

16:39.200 --> 16:44.048
But it's such an atrocity that, I mean, it's on a level that it's so hard to even comprehend.

16:44.128 --> 16:47.794
I mean, I can't even imagine something like that, really.

16:47.834 --> 16:53.023
But I think it affects everybody, just the horrendousness of it.

16:53.764 --> 16:57.310
But I don't think I could have written the novel that I did.

16:57.712 --> 16:59.575
No, I'm sure you couldn't have.

16:59.595 --> 17:00.296
Maybe it would have been different.

17:00.316 --> 17:03.280
It's been some century, hasn't it, when you come right down.

17:03.300 --> 17:06.144
I did an interview last week with Norman Mailer, of all people.

17:07.325 --> 17:08.567
I'm writing that up right now.

17:08.807 --> 17:12.132
And, you know, he is a very interesting man.

17:13.113 --> 17:19.442
What he says is, you know, why has there not been an important philosopher over the last 50 years?

17:19.542 --> 17:21.625
Because it's impossible to deal with the Holocaust.

17:22.286 --> 17:27.533
And you think of, you know, the atrocities that you're writing about.

17:27.513 --> 17:32.720
How do you say, how is it possible for these things to happen in the middle of the 20th century?

17:32.820 --> 17:35.244
But, you know, it's amazing, isn't it?

17:35.664 --> 17:36.225
Yeah, it is.

17:36.305 --> 17:43.054
And you know what's scary, too, is that, like, this whole, um, the comfort camps, it still exists, too.

17:43.074 --> 17:54.390
I mean, it wasn't just 50 years ago, but, you know, it kind of mutated, and it's taken on new forms, and it still goes on in different countries, you know, like the sex tourism trade.

17:54.410 --> 17:55.111
Oh, terrible.

17:55.151 --> 17:56.233
And in Bosnia.

17:56.273 --> 17:57.334
You know, so you have...

17:57.753 --> 18:02.163
The situation going on, it's just, that's what I, yeah.

18:02.183 --> 18:02.805
Human nature.

18:02.825 --> 18:09.360
It happens to still go on in this century, in this day and age when we consider ourselves so enlightened.

18:10.883 --> 18:13.088
So you have a three-year-old daughter?

18:13.649 --> 18:13.730
Yes.

18:13.770 --> 18:14.652
And how do you spell her name?

18:14.692 --> 18:15.694
T-A-E.

18:18.644 --> 18:20.207
They were born on the same day.

18:20.367 --> 18:20.968
You're kidding.

18:21.008 --> 18:21.189
No.

18:23.052 --> 18:25.276
My older sister is also born on that day.

18:25.356 --> 18:25.977
Which is what?

18:26.098 --> 18:27.600
October 9th.

18:27.620 --> 18:27.821
Wow.

18:28.001 --> 18:35.214
So that for three generations now, the oldest daughter to have a daughter.

18:35.896 --> 18:36.717
Isn't that amazing?

18:36.757 --> 18:38.340
Has been born on October 9th.

18:38.675 --> 18:43.421
Well, I mean, there must be some sort of Oriental Asian.

18:44.823 --> 18:45.523
There must be.

18:45.563 --> 18:48.026
Something that has something to say about that.

18:48.327 --> 18:49.688
Yeah, there must be.

18:49.789 --> 18:52.131
I shouldn't have to date in some kind of, you know.

18:52.151 --> 18:53.193
Oh, that's good.

18:53.633 --> 18:56.437
But, yeah, there must be some kind of karmic or genetic thing.

18:56.457 --> 19:03.445
The only thing I have that comes close to that is that my Labrador retriever and I have the same birthday.

19:03.645 --> 19:04.186
Oh, what?

19:04.206 --> 19:05.728
Which is May 25th.

19:05.708 --> 19:07.952
You guys are connected.

19:08.032 --> 19:08.293
She is.

19:08.333 --> 19:11.338
She's going to be nine this year, and I'm somewhat older.

19:13.201 --> 19:17.729
Anyway, I think we've got plenty of stuff here, and I thank you for taking the time to talk to me.

19:18.370 --> 19:20.113
Thanks for rescheduling.

19:20.153 --> 19:20.794
Oh, it's fine.

19:20.854 --> 19:22.417
I'm happy to talk to you.

19:22.437 --> 19:22.958
What a disaster.

19:22.938 --> 19:23.999
That's fine.

19:24.540 --> 19:26.803
So your daughter is not traveling with you?

19:27.123 --> 19:29.646
No, and that's really hard to be away from home.

19:29.666 --> 19:30.007
I'll bet.

19:30.367 --> 19:32.670
Anxious to go home and be with her.

19:32.690 --> 19:40.300
Yeah, I've got two daughters myself, and they're 15 and 14, close together.

19:40.380 --> 19:44.485
And girls are great, I have to tell you that.

19:44.505 --> 19:45.606
They really are.

19:45.626 --> 19:46.527
They're lots of fun.

19:46.588 --> 19:46.988
They're wonderful.

19:47.761 --> 19:48.663
Well, nice talking to you.

19:48.683 --> 19:49.664
Have a safe trip home.

19:50.245 --> 19:50.466
Thank you.

19:50.486 --> 19:53.411
And I hope we meet sometime on the occasion of the next book.

19:53.571 --> 19:54.753
And congratulations.

19:54.834 --> 19:59.161
It's really quite a wonderful book, and the reviews have just been outstanding, so you should be very proud.

20:00.323 --> 20:00.604
Thanks.

20:00.624 --> 20:01.345
Okay, talk to you later.

20:01.445 --> 20:02.107
Bye-bye.

20:02.247 --> 20:02.327
Bye.
