00:04.958 --> 00:27.625
Oh, yeah.

00:30.980 --> 00:46.862
Thank you.

00:47.180 --> 01:15.934
So I'd like to quickly like the last two percent of the major contributors who are here today, who are here today, and both in the presentation, and Robert Craig, who has created a center for the House Fund, a home for individual conservation service centers.

01:15.954 --> 01:16.495
Let's hear a good question.

01:17.909 --> 01:28.469
a wonderful operation, as I say.

01:28.489 --> 01:30.192
It's having an impact on the health of the country when it's made.

01:30.212 --> 01:34.180
I think that people both are also here in Washington, where I think it's a model example.

01:34.160 --> 01:47.441
a federal operation that has a real national impact and use against the private countries.

01:47.461 --> 01:51.527
Now, the Rivers of the America Celebration documentation ever a new project that we've developed by the American Social Life Center,

01:51.710 --> 02:03.632
also required funding to be sent to the Kentucky Health Company represented today by Ariel Kaplan.

02:03.652 --> 02:11.085
Our contributions haven't started, but I'd also like to invite any of our five or six of prisoners here today who want to support the project to make the tax considered tax substance contributions to the Senate.

02:11.065 --> 02:22.997
John Colbert is a graduate of the details, or he doesn't have any kind of relatives, so in other words.

02:23.858 --> 02:27.442
He plays for Latin style, which is a worthy cause for the future.

02:27.462 --> 02:37.292
60 of that version of the Rivers of the American Book Review tells the filmmaker, one of the important books in American culture,

02:37.272 --> 02:55.855
And I guess, of course, if I tell you something of the important books in my own room, my father was a neighbor at Memphis College.

02:55.835 --> 03:14.755
... ... ...

03:14.735 --> 03:42.042
It was wonderful to see that it was all about it, because it wasn't underlining, it wasn't cheaper underlining.

03:42.022 --> 03:58.941
And I'm going to start thinking about this.

03:59.402 --> 04:10.695
My brother, who wrote about this book, written a book that's known for the series of most powerful bridges,

04:10.675 --> 04:16.566
and that's always fantastic.

04:16.586 --> 04:18.778
It's really an annual program that comes to Columbia University.

04:18.944 --> 04:45.019
adjusting to the ruler and both the dance and the tradition kind of represents sort of convenience for history of America and also thought about the challenge.

04:45.039 --> 04:48.023
But I also remember my academic field in the Russian field and it's interesting that it's been a great effort on the price of a two-day point.

04:48.577 --> 05:05.091
Publications that really didn't feel like .

05:05.772 --> 05:05.792
.

05:05.772 --> 05:23.173
It's a powerful, powerful story.

05:23.153 --> 05:32.365
.

05:32.385 --> 05:48.547
.

05:48.567 --> 05:48.587
.

05:48.567 --> 05:49.829
.

05:49.849 --> 05:50.810
.

05:52.553 --> 05:55.177
.

05:55.197 --> 06:08.618
.

06:08.598 --> 06:26.961
which fortunately we still think i was one of primarily in this country and uh it's really a great epic project

06:26.941 --> 06:28.263
.

06:28.283 --> 06:28.543
.

06:30.145 --> 06:30.505
.

06:31.146 --> 06:38.676
.

06:40.418 --> 06:47.667
.

06:47.647 --> 07:08.929
Thank you all.

07:08.909 --> 07:35.963
Thank you all.

07:46.962 --> 07:47.658
Thank you.

07:55.687 --> 07:59.212
Thank you, Dr. Billion, who has left.

08:00.053 --> 08:02.877
We hope they'll be able to talk a lot later.

08:02.897 --> 08:12.130
It's interesting, at one point we didn't make last night and haven't made yet, was the first thought of the river series.

08:12.150 --> 08:22.564
You know, many of you know that she was thinking of rivers of the world, and Dr. Billion ends up talking about broken.

08:22.584 --> 08:25.508
And gosh, maybe we should have an international part to argue about it.

08:25.808 --> 08:48.913
We're now going to shift gears just slightly, and I would like to ask for the authors of the Rivers books who are here to come and join me on the platform, if that's okay, because what we'd like to have is a discussion for a little while about the Rivers books from the author's perspective.

08:48.893 --> 08:59.195
And after that, we will take a break and continue with the program.

08:59.215 --> 09:06.250
But I have my list, so I can do this quite easily.

09:06.270 --> 09:08.455
I just want to invite Mike Clark, Wilma, Jim, Dunn,

09:08.992 --> 09:13.280
Bill Ellen, Richard Matthews, and Margaret is here.

09:13.540 --> 09:29.449
Come on up here, so we can get your remarks and have a discussion with me about being an author of .

09:30.110 --> 09:31.793
Take a minute and let you all up here.

09:41.695 --> 09:53.642
Well, I should say that the idea here is to keep this as informal as we can, and I'm not asking anybody to give any speech at all.

09:54.684 --> 09:58.894
I don't object when I'm not asking.

09:58.874 --> 10:18.891
And I'm also going to be helped, and I'm looking in the audience at Carol and at David Taylor and at Peter Barton in the back, who know many of you folks that have talked to you, for some questions and to ask you a little along.

10:18.871 --> 10:40.153
to get on the record for us is how each of you first got involved in writing the book, whether you took the initiative as we heard last night in a couple of cases, you were asked, or how it happened that you became a Rivers of America author.

10:40.387 --> 10:51.928
Maybe Richard, we can start all the way down to the end with the author of the book that perhaps was most recently published.

10:52.188 --> 10:53.831
No, I'll do myself.

10:55.133 --> 10:59.982
Yeah, there's a book that I wrote about the Utah River in Alaska.

10:59.962 --> 11:07.212
I had done some writing mostly to deliver, recording for magazines, actually.

11:07.773 --> 11:20.311
But I know it's been an interesting while in the country, and I wanted some way to get to the last family.

11:20.672 --> 11:27.201
So I noticed it's the, somehow I had a copy of some of the series, but I noticed this big gap.

11:27.181 --> 11:49.583
the Yukon River, which probably trained in the Kansas State of North America, wasn't on it.

11:49.603 --> 11:57.171
And so I simply contacted a post, and over at that point, I've written a long article on a river that runs through Ontario, across Ontario,

11:57.151 --> 12:13.506
We took the initiative and they agreed.

12:13.486 --> 12:31.393
I was a local person after having done the book.

12:31.373 --> 12:46.540
So, on and on, I worked with Fisherman and was up and down the coast.

12:47.101 --> 12:51.289
She was not every case in her senior 20 years.

12:51.269 --> 13:13.395
You know, another favorite center for the book, a project called Books That Made a Difference, and we go around the country interviewing people about books that made a difference in their lives and why, what that difference was, and I guess Richard states that his writing that book made a huge difference in his life because

13:14.033 --> 13:28.056
I guess it kept you going in your adventurous spirit, but also helped cause you to .

13:28.557 --> 13:31.441
That's a pretty good attitude.

13:31.461 --> 13:31.922
That's a good attitude.

13:31.942 --> 13:32.143
Thank you.

13:32.163 --> 13:35.588
Dale, do you want to have a like question about how each person seems to write a title?

13:36.009 --> 13:36.109
Okay.

13:36.899 --> 13:56.055
I had done a little contact with Karl Kammer over this year, but he had done a good review of the first book, and then we were trying to pull on this.

13:56.542 --> 14:16.213
So even if we move forward just a little bit, there's more light, there's light, there we go.

14:16.534 --> 14:18.918
So this project came up, and I'm sure he checked with all of the habits that we knew well.

14:18.938 --> 14:21.081
And so he just wrote a letter that invited me to the book.

14:21.567 --> 14:41.188
I moved back and I said that I was pretty as... I was thinking of calling him, but I kind of said, oh, and so I put him a letter.

14:41.208 --> 14:44.892
And I said that I was delighted to continue the post, that he had been instructions.

14:46.019 --> 14:56.282
And it goes back about a free sentence that we found, which was the writing that you're going to do the book.

14:56.431 --> 15:13.472
And I add to the letter about the instructions, stay very close to the river.

15:13.492 --> 15:21.501
Too well by the city, that's where the book started.

15:21.521 --> 15:22.683
That's very nice, isn't it?

15:22.703 --> 15:23.704
Make it a literary book.

15:24.578 --> 15:34.492
And, uh, since you were yours.

15:35.233 --> 15:40.441
And you said, okay.

15:40.461 --> 15:41.442
Yes, and a little time you said, I won't do that.

15:42.163 --> 15:43.245
I'm terrible.

15:44.069 --> 15:54.465
How long did you work on that post?

15:54.485 --> 16:04.720
Oh, that's the only, it was a post of some of it.

16:04.740 --> 16:08.265
It's going to be right to have a man's goodbye and a post.

16:08.285 --> 16:08.385
What?

16:08.405 --> 16:08.986
It was a horrendous deadline.

16:09.006 --> 16:09.106
Yeah.

16:09.126 --> 16:12.912
And as you know, as Carol knows, I think we kept hearing letters of, I won't call it prodding, but .

16:13.533 --> 16:33.776
A polite reminder of where you stand now.

16:33.796 --> 16:37.280
She was Bella Jean Crockett, a wonderful editor in the United States.

16:37.300 --> 16:39.523
And she was very gentle, very thorough.

16:39.993 --> 16:57.006
I am not a Ph.D., and I did follow the style of Dr. Xavier, and so she was very thorough in that practice.

16:57.290 --> 17:20.614
You know, we've learned in talking to folks the important roles of Charles Farmer and the Stephen Crawford, and I think I would encourage any of our authors and illustrators to have to say about either of these folks or anyone else they work with.

17:20.594 --> 17:49.133
We have another perspective of Herger and Carol's research and enthusiasm and continue to build the records of this wonderful research.

17:50.108 --> 18:06.210
Well, my

18:07.186 --> 18:17.381
The beginnings of the American River were on a very new October day.

18:17.401 --> 18:28.637
I had gone for a year to be my friend, a first day historian in the Civil War and the American Revolution.

18:28.617 --> 18:40.251
And we've been corresponding for a number of years, and this was the first year.

18:40.271 --> 18:50.963
And Hayes Barnes, who was working with our kids on a book about the dark town, of course, the surrender and all that.

18:50.943 --> 18:55.732
So that was one of his revolutionary work, probably.

18:55.752 --> 19:00.782
I was working for a new project.

19:01.343 --> 19:04.349
I had just changed about six months before.

19:04.970 --> 19:09.498
Two-line biography of Robert and Lee.

19:09.518 --> 19:12.985
I've had worked on it for six and a half years, and I was hoping to edit something that was different.

19:13.252 --> 19:23.726
So after the amenities and readings in the office, Burke said to me, how would you like to write a river book?

19:23.746 --> 19:40.828
It was a totally new idea, and it was very appealing after months and months and years in archives with him, civil war material, material about leaving his family and so on.

19:40.808 --> 19:44.774
But I didn't want to tell him to do it.

19:44.794 --> 19:54.508
And it seems that Kate Barnes, which had proposed for David, that he writes a book for the written series on your written.

19:55.689 --> 20:01.658
And I recall very well, he said, well, I think I'll do it if I get time.

20:02.179 --> 20:06.545
And he already was into a couple more books.

20:06.565 --> 20:07.947
He was very worried, very terrible.

20:08.230 --> 20:11.134
So, we discussed the idea of a river.

20:11.154 --> 20:20.566
He said, over and out of which you would like something, a river in the West, and you can't remember why you may use something in your own state or close by.

20:21.227 --> 20:33.023
And he did suggest the Snake River, which is part of this enormous river, enormous and long, starting in the peaks of, well, the range is beyond the key time.

20:33.003 --> 20:40.600
to recommend, and coming all the way to Georgia, Columbia, to be a witness.

20:41.035 --> 20:52.735
It was an appealing idea, but I had not been there for that country at the time, so I couldn't say it's .

20:52.755 --> 21:02.572
At the end of it, we talked a good deal about rumors and the importance of rumors and the meaning of the historical value.

21:02.592 --> 21:04.055
So I said, well, I'll go back to tell if I'm going to go back home.

21:04.075 --> 21:06.098
I'll look around and see what we have there

21:06.078 --> 21:10.083
and what could be very interesting.

21:10.204 --> 21:16.492
So this night held over four months in my mind.

21:16.512 --> 21:25.965
So this was done, and after I, we went and saw the vast extent of the St.

21:25.985 --> 21:28.007
Burford, which was a huge project.

21:28.027 --> 21:31.512
It's not only physically huge, but the history of it.

21:31.492 --> 21:39.413
So, anyway, I sort of put that in the back of my mind and decided to have closed his home.

21:39.614 --> 21:45.770
And suddenly I realized, almost in my back door, was the American earth.

21:45.790 --> 21:47.695
I didn't think of that as much as possible.

21:47.675 --> 22:03.220
And so then I began to do some research on the American University and went up there and did a few research and walked and moved and there's a few people and went into a few archives and I decided

22:03.200 --> 22:11.857
that the American might not be as bad as the country.

22:11.877 --> 22:21.495
Certainly, and historically, the importance of it, because the discovery rules in 1848 and 1849 were changed from a hard time.

22:21.475 --> 22:31.026
And there was no other river in America that I knew of that had such a reason as the American people.

22:31.147 --> 22:40.177
And we in California were aware that it was all around us, but we were not thinking of a concern of world history.

22:40.277 --> 22:42.420
But when you felt the thing that

22:42.923 --> 22:57.985
Outside of the crusade, the rest of the road race in California in 1849 is the greatest voluntary migration to the world.

22:58.005 --> 23:00.809
And so that to me was just what I said.

23:00.829 --> 23:02.451
So I wrote that to your face after the war.

23:02.431 --> 23:18.420
And I learned one who was thinking about this and said, I'm not going to be safe, but I'm going to be American.

23:18.441 --> 23:21.386
And he said, I will introduce you to Faith Barnes if you desire to deliver.

23:21.406 --> 23:23.690
So I said, I would like to talk to him.

23:23.710 --> 23:24.692
And so he put us in contact.

23:24.672 --> 23:45.976
I wrote an order and gave her some idea of what I'm feeling about the importance of it.

23:45.996 --> 23:48.559
Because I think most people think that it's a real, very world important.

23:48.579 --> 23:49.840
So this is how it happened.

23:49.860 --> 23:54.325
And maybe it was apparently very briefly compared to what I would suggest to follow the idea of the pattern.

23:54.305 --> 24:17.562
and asked me to sort of put it into a little essay form, not very long, to take, to submit to Carl Farmer, because at that time, he had a task on it, and he comes, I was, we keep talking about how,

24:17.693 --> 24:36.060
And yes, they would like to help.

24:36.080 --> 24:36.641
And so that's how I started.

24:36.661 --> 24:41.108
And I was about three years researching the field and studying the Indians.

24:41.128 --> 24:41.929
And I decided to do something like this.

24:41.909 --> 24:50.522
as of major importance, he was through the background.

24:50.742 --> 25:01.778
And so I went very early to the geology, and not just in a thriving street, but something that the layman will understand and enjoy, but factual, totally.

25:01.798 --> 25:09.790
So he has the beginnings, the geological beginnings, he has the Indians and their ground.

25:09.770 --> 25:27.002
The first of the occasions we came in here, it was not always us, it was originally people, pioneers who were after where we were, and then of course the road.

25:27.168 --> 25:41.759
You gave us your interpretation.

25:41.779 --> 25:46.830
One of the reasons, of course, that writers were preferred in the beginning was that writers were more likely to give that cultural interpretation of the research that they do.

25:47.249 --> 26:06.572
Also, I should point out that Kate is here, and we're going to get her perspective on and see some of the letters.

26:06.592 --> 26:06.912
Thank you, Mark.

26:06.932 --> 26:11.738
Again, if you'd like to tell us a little bit about how you guys are going to go.

26:13.321 --> 26:23.376
When I was born, I was too small to go on the safe part of it.

26:23.396 --> 26:26.120
And so we camped in the area.

26:26.140 --> 26:29.245
My father had an interest in outdoor rivers and how far it is.

26:29.265 --> 26:32.730
He was a boy scout he had to do.

26:32.750 --> 26:33.591
He was in Minnesota.

26:33.908 --> 26:49.233
He came to Philadelphia, but he wanted to live, when he came in Philadelphia from Philadelphia, he wanted to live on a river like the Whistaria that's outside of Philadelphia.

26:49.253 --> 26:50.034
That's the hill where he was born.

26:52.078 --> 26:58.448
So when I was old enough not to fall off with maybe the age of three,

26:59.002 --> 27:05.596
And we moved out from this room to the St.

27:05.616 --> 27:05.777
Prairie.

27:07.039 --> 27:13.092
And we bought property, built cabins, two cabins.

27:13.353 --> 27:15.898
One and the second ones came away from it.

27:15.918 --> 27:18.805
And we lived on the St.

27:18.825 --> 27:18.985
Prairie.

27:19.488 --> 27:29.519
I'd take off my shoes with shoes after smooth and take off.

27:29.539 --> 27:42.353
And put them back on together, go down to the river and wash the shoes, put the shoes back on in the fall.

27:43.013 --> 27:47.718
So we had a great life at that time.

27:47.738 --> 27:49.360
I think I was my father's favorite because it seems to me a diary he said about

27:49.762 --> 28:03.256
I seem to be the one who ended up always with him going someplace.

28:05.378 --> 28:11.725
So, I have an inborn interest.

28:11.905 --> 28:16.410
Another self-collector.

28:19.883 --> 28:40.696
I continued to enjoy the river life, and I went away to school and to Hamilton College and graduated.

28:40.716 --> 28:45.543
And at Hamilton, I had a very proud honor for a few years when I graduated, early graduate in 1912.

28:46.044 --> 28:46.144
Yeah.

28:46.748 --> 28:57.302
I haven't been here then, but later, he became very close friends.

28:57.322 --> 29:02.009
Because for seven years, I was in Cooperstown, New York.

29:02.289 --> 29:13.164
I was at the Library of the American Native Historical Association, and took part in seminars on American culture.

29:13.184 --> 29:15.247
He's still working for a whole course, I guess, and right there.

29:15.267 --> 29:16.148
Now, I'm connecting with local universities.

29:17.123 --> 29:35.244
So, I had been born in this, and I had saved my father's chickens.

29:35.644 --> 29:39.348
He really loved to sing for everything.

29:39.368 --> 29:45.996
And I was at Cooperstown, and he finally came to me, and the invitation was to go to Minnesota.

29:46.016 --> 29:47.097
That's kind of library, the Minnesota District Center.

29:48.022 --> 30:00.078
And when Maria and I, my wife and I were living in St.

30:00.098 --> 30:08.089
Paul, we heard that Carl Caron was going to come to the Allison College to give a lecture.

30:08.288 --> 30:16.838
Well, no, I've got to backtrack just a little.

30:16.978 --> 30:25.768
When I was in Cooperstown, Carl was the hand of people like Carl, Henry Vestin, Harold Thompson, he didn't write a record of his book, unfortunately.

30:25.788 --> 30:35.440
There were others who were on the staff, but he started the society at the time and so on.

30:35.460 --> 30:37.502
And at that time, I was known to be governor of Eddie and Carl Carmel.

30:37.904 --> 30:43.054
And when we were there, I said, how would you like to be here?

30:43.372 --> 30:49.579
which was the joy of receiving and looking at a book about the Strait of the River.

30:50.320 --> 30:51.861
We knew nothing about it.

30:51.881 --> 30:52.542
I said, where is it?

30:52.562 --> 30:55.765
I said, there's a brand new thing.

30:55.785 --> 30:56.646
When it is, let me know.

30:59.930 --> 31:03.093
You didn't say the border river or the midway?

31:04.034 --> 31:04.095
No.

31:04.115 --> 31:10.001
The fact that we earlier had a new day are different things.

31:10.021 --> 31:10.982
Anyway,

31:13.426 --> 31:19.835
We moved to St.

31:19.855 --> 31:21.462
Paul to John Denison Library at the Minnesota State of the Society.

31:22.218 --> 31:37.061
I heard that Charles was going to come up to my house too, so I wrote him a letter and asked him to eat his coffee in his apartment.

31:37.682 --> 31:46.635
And he came at a nice visit in the closing, and I said, do you remember about eight years ago or six years ago?

31:46.655 --> 31:49.680
I had asked you about the same order.

31:49.700 --> 31:51.162
Well, here it is.

31:51.462 --> 31:56.331
And I finished it.

31:58.274 --> 32:12.559
And about six weeks, two months later, I got a telegram saying, so I just fell into it.

32:16.353 --> 32:19.397
Yeah.

32:20.238 --> 32:23.121
On the issue, he said, well, here it is.

32:23.141 --> 32:29.388
I thought you were pointing to her about it.

32:29.649 --> 32:32.272
Yeah, well, here it is.

32:33.834 --> 32:37.018
I guess we have.

32:37.038 --> 32:45.027
And so, moving from there on.

32:47.757 --> 33:03.899
who worked on it, I'll never forget the, Carl's Attitude, and Jane Crawford.

33:04.359 --> 33:08.184
She was, and I knew she helped me.

33:08.204 --> 33:10.788
She got coffee in two or three rooms, and I'd have gotten them with friends, but any other ever.

33:10.808 --> 33:11.689
It was a thorough chemistry problem.

33:12.327 --> 33:21.793
For instance, the territorial prison, the sizable place, the history of it.

33:21.813 --> 33:25.965
She said, you know, I could, you've got it in the square.

33:26.806 --> 33:37.781
feet or yards or something out of the size of it, he said, I could put that in my living room.

33:37.801 --> 33:41.266
So, if I should do that, it would come out.

33:41.286 --> 33:47.394
I owe a great deal to the people who are catching movies like that.

33:47.414 --> 33:54.163
I also owe them even more of the death to the Esther of Minnesota's people.

33:55.038 --> 34:00.987
She was a close friend.

34:01.968 --> 34:12.785
She and her brother, her husband, Don, were my best friends, our best friends.

34:12.805 --> 34:22.800
And he, in fact, Don was the one who took her last chapter with me for a trip from the source of the things where so-and-so comes down to

34:23.253 --> 34:41.910
After reading the manuscript, she was my manager.

34:41.930 --> 34:45.497
After changing the manuscript,

34:45.916 --> 35:12.885
offered to look at the manuscript and criticize it she really criticized she said aren't you going to write anything about this council you know the river has two sides somehow

35:13.405 --> 35:16.248
Also, she said, well, what are you going to do?

35:16.268 --> 35:26.200
Are you going to tell the story of every prisoner that ever went into a paranoid prison?

35:26.440 --> 35:37.673
So, I owe a great deal to the criticism and the guidance of Carl, of Gene Crawford, and a few American folks.

35:39.435 --> 35:41.758
Also, the fact that

35:42.802 --> 35:53.458
are the president of the director of the Historic Society allowed me to do what I wanted to do and take the time I wanted to take.

35:53.598 --> 35:57.244
Because the Minnesota Historic Society wanted the public to vote for me.

35:57.264 --> 36:03.493
And I went to Russell Fridley and said, do you mind if I submit it to Carl Abedon's permission?

36:04.148 --> 36:09.155
And he said, no, but whatever is best for you.

36:10.136 --> 36:18.047
And when the acceptance came, I telephoned Russell, told him, and he said, it's fine.

36:18.067 --> 36:18.408
It was beautiful.

36:18.428 --> 36:32.367
And so I owe the freedom I had to do research at the Historical Society as a librarian to really, and I did things that I shouldn't have done, I suppose.

36:33.089 --> 36:37.996
Well, we better stop here.

36:38.216 --> 36:46.768
Anyway, I can tinkle just about anything I want to do with work on the chapter 3.

36:46.788 --> 36:54.318
And so, it became a couple of years ago.

36:54.338 --> 36:55.700
And I think it was a wonderful story.

36:55.720 --> 37:00.126
Of course, it started society then in 1979.

37:00.359 --> 37:09.277
Well, reprints are something we're going to talk about this afternoon.

37:09.297 --> 37:18.857
Reprints, where we go from here, what are some of the other things we can be encouraging in a way to reprint and move rivers, perhaps, to the new government, and perhaps new book series.

37:18.877 --> 37:19.077
Thank you.

37:19.360 --> 37:30.238
Wilma, I'm going to turn to Wilma Dyson now, and later, Wilma, I want you to tell the direct version of the story that I'd like to tell last night about how we did it.

37:30.559 --> 37:35.547
But now, we'd like you to tell us about how you first...

37:36.725 --> 37:57.062
proposed i think i know it's part of the story not because fred rogers was involved indeed i did propose it grew out of the pit my husband and i had made from across the country in a little brown board convertible go to town the rivers of america book

37:57.042 --> 38:07.699
beginning with the Huntson and then going on to two of my favorites at that time, the Powder River, Lent of Fuck, and Frank Wappers, the Comorados.

38:08.280 --> 38:21.781
And both of those books captured the areas of the place, not just the history, which was good, not just the boat roar, which was interesting, but they captured the whole country of that river.

38:21.801 --> 38:22.442
Wow.

38:22.422 --> 38:32.399
So when we came home, after wandering around and enjoying the trip and enjoying these rivers' books, my husband, Jim, came to me one day.

38:32.899 --> 38:34.402
He was interested in writing.

38:34.482 --> 38:38.509
We wrote three books together eventually, and we wrote 10 books together.

38:38.829 --> 38:40.532
We researched it together.

38:40.512 --> 38:59.736
And he said, you know, if you were born and was always lived in Asheville, North Carolina, where the French frog rises, I've always lived in East Tennessee, here in Knoxville, where the French frog, who was born from the Tennessee River, why don't you write a book about the French frog?

38:59.716 --> 39:07.068
Well, I'm not getting any books.

39:07.088 --> 39:13.999
I've written these stories that aren't supposed to have been published, but I really like this idea because I've always loved history.

39:14.019 --> 39:18.967
I grew up in a household, and a lot of the New Yorkers are always trying to understand some of the history, and I'm not going to be able to watch them.

39:18.987 --> 39:19.868
I always didn't understand a lot of history.

39:20.219 --> 39:31.500
I didn't really propose to tell you something about life.

39:31.520 --> 39:31.900
And I love history.

39:31.920 --> 39:34.144
So I thought this would be good because I'm not a formal historian.

39:34.946 --> 39:39.194
I don't have a PhD, but I really like history and I like stories.

39:39.214 --> 39:40.536
So I wrote a letter to Ryan Hart.

39:40.556 --> 39:42.700
At that time, it was Ryan Hart.

39:42.680 --> 39:59.520
And so I wrote this letter, and I said, wouldn't you like to rule about the French Wall?

39:59.540 --> 40:01.602
You see, I didn't know they were so provincial, but I didn't know it was a river.

40:01.722 --> 40:03.344
And I made it even worse.

40:03.364 --> 40:05.086
I compounded my error.

40:05.186 --> 40:12.535
I said, I have done a good deal of research on the subject, and I'm not going to fall.

40:12.515 --> 40:30.692
Well, I just told them later that it caused a lot of merit in the office, and there was a secretary, I think there was a secretary there, and she was in Asheville, she'd gone to see Thomas Will's home in the Biltmore Estate, and she said, no, I think this woman's writing about the river, right?

40:30.672 --> 40:52.140
it was a rejection and they said no we have published books about the major rivers and we're not going to do any about the smaller rivers well right there i was and then of course

40:52.120 --> 40:55.266
They left a little crack in the door.

40:55.326 --> 41:01.999
They said, of course, we put down something about republishing about, we never know why we're going to maintain.

41:02.019 --> 41:04.704
Well, I read that letter about Jim.

41:05.626 --> 41:09.133
He said, well, you know, a man will look about a pond once.

41:10.025 --> 41:25.097
One of our rivers bigger than a pond is a rejection like that when you're all weaker, you know you can either have a man who gets sad.

41:25.077 --> 41:26.739
Well, I got that.

41:26.759 --> 41:45.887
And I thought, you know, I'm really going to write a chapter that I discovered, this wonderful material that had never been written about great livestock rides that used to go from the great farms of Tennessee up through this now valley, thousands and thousands apart, going over to the

41:45.867 --> 41:54.499
You know, if there's any cattle, they'd be going to take a movie of it.

41:54.519 --> 41:58.484
If you can't make a movie, I don't have a problem.

41:59.045 --> 42:02.610
It would be great, you know, even knowledge, agricultural, folklore, environmental, everything.

42:02.630 --> 42:03.291
And there's one of those things.

42:03.311 --> 42:04.853
My husband's been interested in that.

42:04.873 --> 42:08.398
He's a wonderful people, whether it's black man, you know, some of the dogs and others.

42:08.378 --> 42:17.553
So anyway, I wrote that chapter, and I think it, and I said, well, this is the tiny material I had in mind.

42:17.693 --> 42:19.596
So I don't want that post-taste.

42:19.616 --> 42:20.738
This is wonderful.

42:20.758 --> 42:22.100
Where's the rest of the book?

42:22.460 --> 42:28.550
The rest of the book is out there in the archives and all these things.

42:28.911 --> 42:31.235
I've been taking them together, taking all these years.

42:31.435 --> 42:32.817
We didn't know why.

42:32.797 --> 42:37.705
We had no idea it would be a river book, but we made a lot.

42:37.845 --> 42:42.413
So I did an outline, a chapter for them.

42:42.433 --> 42:51.107
And I think it's interesting that the only chapter that they questioned in this whole outline was what I have on pollution of the river.

42:51.127 --> 42:57.117
You realize how few of the river's books really have dealt with the pollution of the river.

42:57.181 --> 42:59.845
And I discovered my river.

42:59.865 --> 43:00.806
That's the wonderful thing about him.

43:00.906 --> 43:06.474
Elijah, you have to look and listen and discover what's all around you.

43:06.494 --> 43:21.855
And I discovered that here was this wonderful river that comes out of all the tributaries that were the national arts and part of it, one of the main tributaries, was so dead because of pollution that the lowest form of life couldn't live in it.

43:21.835 --> 43:24.860
And that really makes you angry.

43:25.701 --> 43:27.364
And so what to do?

43:27.384 --> 43:29.287
I didn't even leave the contract.

43:29.307 --> 43:35.718
I would have sent them a pint of blood if they could ask if they would reviv, if they would publish my book.

43:35.738 --> 43:36.199
So here I was.

43:36.720 --> 43:39.805
And they said, you know, this is going to be lively and interesting.

43:39.825 --> 43:47.117
But really, we think that it could be a very dull chapter of what they're adding up to.

43:47.097 --> 43:50.822
And, of course, that was in the early 50s.

43:50.842 --> 43:53.766
We hadn't yet decided we were drinking sludge.

43:54.087 --> 44:04.521
And so I wrote that, and I said, well, you know, I really want to do this book, and if I do it, I have to have this chapter in it, and I'll try to make it interesting.

44:04.681 --> 44:07.645
This is your story, but it's not my story.

44:07.665 --> 44:08.747
I'll try to make it.

44:08.887 --> 44:14.995
I have to have about what's happening in the river, and I'll try to make it interesting, and I'll call it, who killed?

44:18.012 --> 44:21.918
Maybe they'll think it's a murder mystery.

44:22.639 --> 44:23.521
It's a murder.

44:23.801 --> 44:25.684
There's no history about it.

44:25.864 --> 44:38.164
The interesting thing about that was that eventually when the book was published, that chapter got more attention across the country than all in North Carolina, as you can imagine, the environmental world.

44:38.144 --> 44:44.099
to San Francisco, one of the reviews there, on the editorial page.

44:44.119 --> 44:53.503
And I remember one of the people that I got crazy along the way, actually, they were very pleased, and they said, Dr. Vincent, I'll be glad we had that chapter, and I think we'd certainly

44:53.483 --> 45:04.933
Anyway, so after that, he said, oh, fine, if you feel it, she told me about it.

45:05.734 --> 45:13.281
And I got a letter from my mother named Jane Crawford, and she said, Carl Conner, this is one of the things that stands out.

45:13.301 --> 45:19.907
I published 17 books, this little phrase stands out to keep me going when, you know, somehow, somehow.

45:20.027 --> 45:23.170
She said, Carl Conner said, you are a brilliant folklorist.

45:23.521 --> 45:25.504
Oh, boys?

45:26.266 --> 45:29.812
He said it was brilliant.

45:29.832 --> 45:31.515
I was ready to accept it.

45:31.695 --> 45:36.183
And he worked me on to do the research.

45:36.203 --> 45:40.551
And the research took me all kinds of archives in other cities in North Carolina.

45:40.531 --> 45:55.046
So we were the National Archives here in Washington, and I did the research on papers about the Civil War in this area, which was so divided, and things that I think have never been touched since they've been in the archives here.

45:55.206 --> 45:58.033
But anyway, it's written down a little road

45:58.013 --> 46:05.706
hills, hills, valleys, into the cities.

46:05.726 --> 46:13.840
We talked to people in the towers of industry, and then we talked to people out working on their phones.

46:13.860 --> 46:18.047
They would tell us about somebody who was shot next, having their sitting under the platter, a Democrat shot, a ripoff.

46:18.027 --> 46:23.498
The Civil War there wasn't gone.

46:23.578 --> 46:26.383
I mean, it just changed things.

46:27.145 --> 46:30.050
Their history was very much there.

46:30.672 --> 46:35.040
And so when the book was published, of course,

46:35.020 --> 46:50.436
I've seen really close things with the conference and with Dean Crawford, and I'm so glad to hear all the comments about Dean Crawford, because she was the heart, I think, of the success of that series.

46:50.876 --> 46:58.283
From the moment she entered that, she visited me in North Carolina and Tennessee.

46:58.304 --> 46:59.305
We became good friends.

46:59.325 --> 47:01.787
I saw her in Brooklyn and her apartment there.

47:01.767 --> 47:15.507
She was meticulous and she had a knowledge of American history that was really remarkable and she was a help of all of us who were writing for her.

47:15.527 --> 47:19.253
And I think that she cannot be praised too much.

47:19.233 --> 47:21.296
Of course, we all loved Donald Trump.

47:21.777 --> 47:27.886
He was the most interesting person.

47:27.906 --> 47:30.690
He also came to Asheville and to Tennessee.

47:30.710 --> 47:35.597
I think he wanted to just be sure that, you know, what is his life in here?

47:35.797 --> 47:39.623
We do wear shoes, you know.

47:39.803 --> 47:42.267
He's written that wonderful book, Stars Fall Out in Alabama.

47:42.567 --> 47:45.832
So he had been in the South briefly, but he really did not.

47:45.852 --> 47:46.573
And I did his name.

47:46.553 --> 47:52.467
They're offering them a number of questions there.

47:53.029 --> 47:57.199
And we've made great plans for them.

47:57.640 --> 48:03.634
And Stanley Blancart, also, I got to know him very well, because he's a partner there with his mother-in-law.

48:03.614 --> 48:18.483
And speaking of Harvey Allen, I just think it would be a little interesting footnote here, is that when Reinhart was started, of course, the mother, sons of Reinhart, and the three sons, and the depression occurred.

48:18.504 --> 48:23.293
And one book called Reinhart and the Company, Out of the Depression.

48:23.273 --> 48:25.397
You know what it was?

48:25.417 --> 48:29.685
It was Herman Allen's Anthony Adverse.

48:29.886 --> 48:37.841
And I guess that good title, Adverse, feels for people in the Depression because people could afford to write a book.

48:37.901 --> 48:40.907
I mean, read a book, I guess, and get it from the library.

48:40.987 --> 48:42.109
But that book,

48:42.089 --> 48:58.107
and one other thing that we did not mention, and that is some of the illustrators of our relationships.

48:58.127 --> 49:02.512
And then when I have one little story, you may share it about Douglas Gorsman.

49:02.532 --> 49:05.515
Douglas Gorsman was the son-in-law of the great editor of Axel Perkins.

49:05.782 --> 49:24.083
When my husband and I met through Thomas Wolfe's family, my husband had known Thomas Wolfe and liked to work very much, and I grew up in Asheville in Oklahoma, but we met through Thomas Wolfe.

49:24.583 --> 49:27.807
And of course, Gordon did an illustrated edition of Thomas Wolfe's novel, A Comer and Eagle, or Cripper.

49:27.787 --> 49:34.138
Well, when I came to my answer, I said, do you have any ideas for an illustrator?

49:34.158 --> 49:37.244
And I said, I'll leave that in the back.

49:37.264 --> 49:37.845
I said, get me up.

49:37.865 --> 49:42.112
I've probably rubble the milk feathers and caused enough questions to write in the book.

49:42.433 --> 49:46.420
And I said, I don't know anything about illustrations, thanks to you.

49:46.400 --> 49:59.998
So then Dean Crawford told me later, she said, well, we have a wonderful place for me to illustrate your book, Douglas Corson.

50:00.018 --> 50:07.407
Well, after Thomas Wolfe died, my husband had asked Douglas Corson had done the only portrait of Thomas Wolfe for which Thomas Wolfe ever sat.

50:07.648 --> 50:08.549
There have been no reportage.

50:08.569 --> 50:11.973
There's the only one he ever sat at the old Chelsea Hotel.

50:11.993 --> 50:13.335
Douglas Corson did a great year.

50:13.315 --> 50:19.445
got to do it because he was Thomas Wolfe.

50:19.465 --> 50:23.672
I mean, because he was that of what Perkins came about.

50:23.692 --> 50:27.018
Perkins had asked Wolfe if he was a kid, that he did.

50:27.318 --> 50:35.712
Well, my husband was such an admirer for Wolfe that he asked Wolfe, right after Wolfe said that he would be able to copy of that portrait for him.

50:35.692 --> 50:47.712
So, Dorsten gives a copy of his portrait of Wolf, the Greek portrait is in the home of Monterey, at the harbour, the copy.

50:48.413 --> 50:52.299
And so, anyway, he had done this.

50:52.319 --> 50:55.945
So then when they sent him his manuscript, Dean Crawford said,

50:55.925 --> 51:01.816
He came down in the college and he said, well, this is a really interesting manuscript.

51:01.836 --> 51:09.952
And he said, I just wonder, he said, the only person I know is a young man who lives in Tennessee named Jim Stokely.

51:10.353 --> 51:18.709
And I wonder if this woman from Asheville, Lilla Dauphin, if they had happened to have met because she writes about the world in the book.

51:18.689 --> 51:22.720
And she said, yes, they met, indeed they are married.

51:23.682 --> 51:25.427
Well, he was astonished.

51:25.587 --> 51:34.791
And the only two people I know, they're working on a book that's been a book of them, you know, pictures, therefore, both of them.

51:35.041 --> 51:49.202
One other story, Jim said, when he brought his original sketches now to show them what he intended to do then for the French prom that they would gather to edit his prom.

51:49.382 --> 51:53.748
You know, the editors would gather there, and he set up the easels.

51:53.768 --> 52:01.099
Here was a picture, a Daisy May picture, walking down the mountain road, looking over her back, and across it, it says,

52:02.362 --> 52:24.859
and immediately he said well maybe you i did do an alternative and so then he turned it off of course it's the one that came out

52:24.839 --> 52:44.350
The great loss of my life is, can you imagine why I did not ask for that original cover that doesn't source me from?

52:44.330 --> 52:56.547
And it's been one of the greatest fairs in my life.

52:56.747 --> 52:58.650
Oh, it's always been very nice.

52:58.670 --> 52:59.411
It's just something in my book.

52:59.431 --> 53:01.073
It's the length from the determinants of purpose.

53:01.093 --> 53:04.478
Somebody said, you know, Wendell Miner, or Wendell Miner, just had a new theater in New York.

53:04.498 --> 53:05.800
There's a cover of that.

53:05.820 --> 53:09.705
And it would take you to all the TV, hopefully, from which that cover was made.

53:09.725 --> 53:11.147
But I never got to worry about it.

53:17.725 --> 53:32.948
We're going to turn to Dr. Clark, from whom we heard last night, and now he's going to be focused on.

53:32.968 --> 53:39.598
We're going to turn to Dr. Clark, from whom we heard last night, and now he's going to be focused on.

53:39.832 --> 53:55.048
When the Prince Ball came out, I was headed to a general celebration.

53:55.068 --> 54:08.522
And my husband came up with the Prince Ball and he said, I want to ask you, Prince William had just started publishing books about women.

54:08.542 --> 54:09.163
I got into this river business.

54:11.050 --> 54:13.112
through the back door, I think.

54:13.132 --> 54:27.429
I'm sure I'd read Constance Blaine and Skinner's essay, which appeared in the first five, I'm reading, of the river books.

54:28.791 --> 54:34.037
And that's all that self-conscious, the fact that she, uh, very often limited to her story.

54:36.785 --> 54:48.763
I was riding one day with Constance Lewis, as I told her last night.

54:49.604 --> 54:53.971
We were driving down the power train in Camp Maryland.

54:53.991 --> 54:57.616
And I said, you know, I'd like to move forward to doing the concussion.

54:57.636 --> 54:58.798
But it's all for me, excuse me.

54:58.818 --> 55:00.721
It's all for me to have a place.

55:00.741 --> 55:02.724
She said, well, I'm on the guy you'd like to do in Ohio.

55:02.744 --> 55:05.087
If you want to do this in Kentucky, I will ride down the path.

55:05.337 --> 55:08.802
And she did.

55:10.024 --> 55:19.679
And I had a letter from John asking me if I would send my book, the round-faging frontier, just in book, asking me to send copies of that book.

55:19.699 --> 55:27.010
And right as Steve mentioned, Renee DeRoger, a very good book, a reveal of that book.

55:27.030 --> 55:32.138
And in the same way, I got the contract for her baby.

55:32.371 --> 55:47.495
I never saw a correspondent in any way in the U.S.

55:47.515 --> 55:47.695
Congress.

55:47.715 --> 55:54.265
As a matter of fact, I don't think she ever knew about the protection.

55:54.285 --> 55:59.914
You can tell me the river is a tremendous, very interesting stream that you may go outside of it.

56:00.248 --> 56:13.630
And I stand on the bridge sometimes and frankly, and look at the flow of that stream, gently drifting down between North and South states.

56:14.532 --> 56:26.391
The state, only by every power, and knowledge, right across the street, goes off of so much diverse humanity in Kentucky.

56:27.535 --> 56:35.451
It's a heartland river, despite its location within the same state.

56:35.471 --> 56:44.650
The river, they come down, off the hills, almost to the streets of blood flowing out of the river.

56:45.085 --> 57:00.309
go down off the hills where they once stood the most magnificent sand of working timber, and all the world, I should say, the signals timber, and all the world.

57:02.152 --> 57:08.882
Down that tree with the mountaineers, mountaineers that risked their lives,

57:10.195 --> 57:17.803
and sold that birthright of timber for almost the best of honey.

57:17.823 --> 57:22.828
But in and around, that came down, personalities.

57:22.848 --> 57:32.578
Personalities who never get any babies from American Indians.

57:32.598 --> 57:33.639
Never the best people.

57:33.659 --> 57:39.325
They were, I want to play a tribute to one soul who never, never,

57:39.777 --> 57:45.024
crazy to get on the face of this man.

57:45.044 --> 57:53.715
A man called, I never know, I don't know what he's saying, what first name he was, if he had a first name.

57:54.296 --> 57:56.699
Turtle neck, ever so.

57:56.719 --> 57:58.341
Turtle had a neck about that long.

57:58.541 --> 58:02.306
And I had a hard time finding it.

58:03.247 --> 58:06.432
All these people told me about Turtle neck.

58:06.592 --> 58:09.075
Where could I go out of Turtle neck?

58:10.270 --> 58:21.146
I called the police chief of Stryford and asked him if he knew of a man named Kirkland Everson.

58:21.166 --> 58:24.450
And he said, wait a minute, we just turned him out of day.

58:26.213 --> 58:31.100
I said, come and I'll take him.

58:31.140 --> 58:33.143
Maybe we can overtake him.

58:33.163 --> 58:35.506
He lives on a household.

58:35.526 --> 58:40.193
And he's a customer of ours.

58:41.303 --> 58:54.432
We got down to the river, and there was a man in a town boat, paddled down to the middle of the river, and the police priest stepped up, said, turn the boat, come back.

58:55.554 --> 59:01.287
And on one feet, he stood up to that town boat, and looked back, and said, what in hell have I never

59:02.735 --> 59:07.382
I hear you, President.

59:07.402 --> 59:10.487
You're soberly in the end of the day.

59:10.507 --> 59:19.921
I hear you, and all the wonderful stories of human beings.

59:20.822 --> 59:24.287
You turn down, say, clarity to your mind.

59:25.162 --> 59:34.159
and those oars on those pitchy long-range spring that one of them was out of the Appalachian Highlands.

59:35.682 --> 59:42.715
But my river was pulled down to more than the mountains, to more than the Virgin Islands.

59:43.302 --> 59:54.939
go down past that place, Whitehall, with that thorny pestle of Eddie's slavery, right there in the heart of the Bluegrass Cassius, Marcella's place.

59:55.680 --> 59:58.884
It made a book with any sense.

59:58.904 --> 01:00:11.863
Then there was his distant cousin, Henry Clay, his father, and actually it was great buddy, and he couldn't let him down and do it together.

01:00:11.883 --> 01:00:13.225
There was Sam Brown,

01:00:13.627 --> 01:00:23.101
Dr. Samuel Brown, the physician, was blown across the mountains, but any smallpox virus kept off.

01:00:23.902 --> 01:00:28.849
He vaccinated Western civilization, Western population moving away.

01:00:30.071 --> 01:00:36.681
And that was John Brown, who was pretty so prominent in the expansion of the Western population.

01:00:37.555 --> 01:00:42.223
Of course, I'm overridden at this point.

01:00:42.243 --> 01:00:47.633
In fact, the two personalities came back down to the money banks of the Kentucky.

01:00:47.653 --> 01:00:49.195
And I started this movie book.

01:00:50.077 --> 01:00:56.368
Daniel Moon, his favorite legend, was marching on, going stronger.

01:00:57.109 --> 01:00:59.293
Every author that comes along,
