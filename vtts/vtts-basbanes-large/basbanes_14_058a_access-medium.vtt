WEBVTT

00:02.123 --> 00:05.607
If we could just start with that little story again.

00:05.627 --> 00:10.232
Well, I was getting together material for this class to show them what we had.

00:10.252 --> 00:10.752
This fifth grade class.

00:10.772 --> 00:12.414
This fifth grade class from a local school.

00:12.434 --> 00:16.018
And they were coming in to see elements of this Johnson family collection.

00:16.278 --> 00:19.541
Right, which included, there was an autograph, a George Washington autograph.

00:19.601 --> 00:23.325
There was a number of Revolutionary War items.

00:24.347 --> 00:27.129
And so I thought, well, what else do we have from that period?

00:27.230 --> 00:30.493
Our collections are not especially strong in...

00:30.862 --> 00:33.826
American colonial war.

00:33.846 --> 00:35.649
But we do have Lafayette papers.

00:35.669 --> 00:43.700
And in the Lafayette papers, there was a letter written by Lafayette's daughter to George Washington.

00:43.720 --> 00:48.406
Seven-year-old girl writing in English to George Washington.

00:48.426 --> 00:54.615
And she was saying that, I'm sorry that my papa isn't home, but I'm glad that he's with you.

00:54.635 --> 00:57.038
And it's written to Washington, Virginia.

00:57.058 --> 01:00.103
And they were enthralled by that.

01:00.123 --> 01:00.463
They were just

01:00.781 --> 01:03.284
And they all wanted copies.

01:03.344 --> 01:14.820
Yeah, but I mean, it's almost a throwback that a kid would find the interaction with text without any pictures magical in L.A.

01:15.100 --> 01:16.221
I was very surprised.

01:16.241 --> 01:17.423
That doesn't happen today.

01:17.463 --> 01:19.606
Usually it's the stuff with whiz-bang.

01:19.646 --> 01:24.252
I mean, they had walked over because it was a local school.

01:24.352 --> 01:26.535
I'm just going to write down the title of that.

01:27.123 --> 01:28.465
Is that something people can buy?

01:28.585 --> 01:35.035
No, partially because the software that is on it is not, is proprietary.

01:35.055 --> 01:35.576
Okay, I'm sorry.

01:36.417 --> 01:38.861
So it was, but I was surprised too.

01:39.061 --> 01:51.079
I really, you know, because then they came back the next term to do Civil War, and we had one of the five copies of the Gettysburg Address.

01:51.099 --> 01:54.765
That was not interesting to them at all.

01:54.785 --> 01:55.105
That's amazing.

01:55.237 --> 01:58.100
So what was there so magical about it?

01:58.120 --> 02:02.645
I think the idea that it was written by a child.

02:04.367 --> 02:16.381
The way people react to rare books and manuscripts is, to a certain extent, the direct connection.

02:16.401 --> 02:23.809
That I'm touching something that somebody held, somebody wrote 100 years ago, 200 years ago, 500 years ago.

02:24.262 --> 02:53.340
and I think there really is that I write about that in my book I mean it's a tactile experience that I get dizzy over yeah and we do too I mean it's and you don't it doesn't get old it gets more it gets more wonderful yeah I'll tell you the story the tape was off just the last week and we found this I'm going you continue anything else to that story I'm sorry so I think that

02:54.113 --> 03:10.570
For these children, the idea that this was something that had been written by a child made it a direct connection to them in a way that, well, this is a big historical document.

03:11.275 --> 03:13.818
Was the child anyone of significance?

03:13.839 --> 03:17.043
Did it matter who the child was or who it had?

03:17.123 --> 03:18.525
Well, they knew about Lafayette.

03:18.545 --> 03:20.267
They'd been studying Lafayette.

03:20.468 --> 03:26.336
It was to George Washington, which obviously did make a big difference to them, George Washington.

03:26.356 --> 03:28.819
Everybody knows George Washington.

03:29.260 --> 03:31.022
But it surprised me.

03:31.390 --> 03:36.518
And I've tried it on other children and gotten very similar responses.

03:36.538 --> 03:37.499
Children who come in.

03:37.579 --> 03:42.126
Who just come in, yeah, or children of staff or something like that.

03:42.226 --> 03:42.887
Yeah, that's great.

03:43.568 --> 03:49.517
We will have that up on the website very soon, actually, that letter.

03:49.938 --> 03:50.839
Okay.

03:50.859 --> 03:52.842
What would I look forward to?

03:54.104 --> 04:06.744
It'll either say Lafayette or French Revolution or something, because there is a... I wonder if I can show you the test.

04:06.764 --> 04:07.065
I don't know.

04:07.085 --> 04:08.587
How do I slow this thing down?

04:08.708 --> 04:15.619
This is driving me nuts.

04:15.639 --> 04:20.086
This is going to go faster.

04:20.106 --> 04:20.787
It's better than I do.

04:27.331 --> 04:38.783
We just went through this little exercise of this letter.

04:39.524 --> 04:53.059
And what we decided was, let's say, that I want to write something about this letter, that on a score, Sierra, uh, well, for you that sent to General Walsh in 1784, you know, listen to that.

04:54.320 --> 04:55.802
Well, I'm doing essential.

04:58.415 --> 05:02.518
see a primary document.

05:02.538 --> 05:02.699
Right.

05:03.359 --> 05:11.306
We can't determine from this sphere on the screen whether there's wax, whether there's a stamp on it on the other side.

05:11.506 --> 05:15.009
You only show one side of this thing, or is there anything on the other side?

05:15.429 --> 05:17.911
Well, I can't believe it, because you can see it.

05:17.931 --> 05:18.432
Okay.

05:18.452 --> 05:19.993
Bet you didn't photoreal.

05:20.013 --> 05:22.215
You didn't scan the other side.

05:22.675 --> 05:26.138
And what you were saying was, what are you trying to tell me?

05:26.819 --> 05:27.519
This is interesting.

05:27.539 --> 05:28.320
This is detective.

05:29.161 --> 05:30.903
Okay, you have one thing.

05:31.524 --> 05:33.566
Did Washington receive this money?

05:33.586 --> 05:36.129
Did he respond to this money?

05:36.149 --> 05:36.630
Do we know?

05:36.650 --> 05:40.394
If we don't know, what could we project about it?

05:40.414 --> 05:41.395
What could we envision?

05:41.996 --> 05:42.757
Imagine.

05:43.217 --> 05:43.397
Right.

05:43.437 --> 05:44.899
We know that Lafayette was here.

05:44.959 --> 05:47.742
She's saying he was here.

05:47.782 --> 05:49.264
Did Washington write to any kids?

05:49.424 --> 05:51.967
Now, what was Washington's relationship?

05:51.987 --> 05:53.269
He had no children with his own.

05:54.590 --> 05:56.232
That's right.

05:56.448 --> 06:02.763
And that's what we want to tell students at the graduate high school.

06:02.783 --> 06:04.507
History is interesting.

06:04.527 --> 06:11.183
History is people who live lives, who do the sorts of things that you do, who do the sorts of things.

06:11.703 --> 06:14.407
I might have a story out of this.

06:14.427 --> 06:16.249
I might have an increase or something.

06:16.269 --> 06:16.450
Oh, yeah.

06:16.470 --> 06:17.170
I mean, I think it's a certain way.

06:17.191 --> 06:19.614
It's something that's worth checking with.

06:19.634 --> 06:20.635
Oh, it's beyond that.

06:20.655 --> 06:23.840
Yeah, well, I mean, just go through this whole process.

06:23.860 --> 06:26.203
This process is what we're doing here.

06:26.223 --> 06:36.597
You know, when Mark Fry or any of the other people here bring out materials to show to students, those are the kind of questions we want them to sort of ask.

06:36.617 --> 06:37.018
What did he do?

06:37.038 --> 06:37.178
Yeah.

06:37.198 --> 06:37.979
What's behind it?

06:38.179 --> 06:38.740
Well, I hope.

06:39.209 --> 06:47.861
of things in our collections for one was four children, one was four girls.

06:48.803 --> 06:55.673
Looking at our collections for things that were five, four, or about children.

06:55.753 --> 06:58.457
What did you come up with?

06:58.557 --> 07:03.744
I can give you a point of one on the media list.

07:03.764 --> 07:08.631
But, uh, I could use the most of my word.

07:08.651 --> 07:09.132
Let me see.

07:11.626 --> 07:40.063
I'm here with the hope that you'll tell me something about the digital programs that you do here.

07:41.495 --> 07:42.896
Can we just enter the discussion?

07:42.916 --> 08:00.195
Tell me a little bit about what you do here at... Well, I can... Well, let me just say, I am really very interested in writing a book that will have a chapter on future libraries, books of the future.

08:01.556 --> 08:06.882
Of course, my current book is a pan to printed books.

08:07.623 --> 08:09.004
So I come in with...

08:10.081 --> 08:19.831
a predisposition to love printing books, but on the other hand, as you can see, I love technology.

08:19.991 --> 08:27.099
What is it about Cornell that makes you a leader, I guess, in this technology?

08:27.119 --> 08:35.307
Why don't I give you some background history on what we've done, and then we can enter into an exchange of questions and answers or comments.

08:36.869 --> 08:37.810
We have...

08:38.228 --> 08:43.133
Our preservation program, as you learned from John yesterday, is 11 years old.

08:44.154 --> 08:50.922
And one of the principal focuses has been dealing with the crisis of brittle paper.

08:52.704 --> 09:02.674
And we estimate probably upwards to a million volumes here at Cornell are endangered by their having been printed on acidic paper.

09:04.356 --> 09:08.100
That for them to be preserved, they'll have to be reformatted

09:09.515 --> 09:16.744
NEH funded efforts in the mid-'80s to launch massive microfilming projects.

09:16.864 --> 09:18.126
We were involved with them.

09:18.567 --> 09:21.010
We continue to be involved with them.

09:21.030 --> 09:39.133
We selectively mined our best collections to create preservation-quality microfilms, starting with our Southeast Asian materials, looking at our Icelandic collection, other collections as well, Peruvian, South American materials.

09:39.468 --> 09:45.714
And these art collections are acknowledged because, of course, the question of selectivity is always one answer.

09:45.734 --> 09:49.898
There's a ranking of a conspectus ranking for libraries.

09:50.378 --> 09:58.346
It's a self-ranking process to identify those of where you fit on a scale of one to five.

09:58.846 --> 10:05.712
Five would be comprehensive, that you have collected everything in the past and continue.

10:05.732 --> 10:06.513
Five is the highest.

10:06.693 --> 10:07.534
Five is the highest.

10:08.020 --> 10:18.416
And we focus on our level fives for the retrospective conversion of the informational content.

10:18.637 --> 10:20.580
So it's not hard, actually, to decide.

10:20.600 --> 10:21.782
It's not all that hard.

10:22.022 --> 10:22.503
Yeah.

10:22.523 --> 10:22.683
Yeah.

10:22.843 --> 10:24.947
We're systematically working our way through.

10:24.967 --> 10:25.468
It's pretty obvious.

10:25.488 --> 10:30.055
You don't have to have a PhD that says, should we do a Lafayette collection?

10:30.075 --> 10:31.076
You know, that's pretty easy.

10:31.477 --> 10:32.138
It's pretty easy.

10:32.573 --> 10:42.947
What we do with our baseline program here is to address that material which is endangered and used, regardless of where it fits in the discipline.

10:42.968 --> 10:47.834
And projects are focusing on our depths.

10:48.435 --> 10:54.003
And that we focus on the best of what we have, which are the Level 5s, some of the Level 4s.

10:54.864 --> 11:01.213
We also look at where the opportunities for funding, because all of these efforts have been funded from the outside.

11:04.265 --> 11:06.728
How did they decide what to fund?

11:06.748 --> 11:08.550
They being the funding agencies?

11:08.570 --> 11:14.818
They being the entities outside the university.

11:15.959 --> 11:21.787
Well, the NEH, National Endowment for the Humanities, has been one of our principal funders, but not our only.

11:22.087 --> 11:23.729
You have Kodak, for instance.

11:23.769 --> 11:24.310
Oh, yeah.

11:24.330 --> 11:29.496
I mean, we've been very successful in grant writing in this department.

11:29.898 --> 11:59.449
Mellon has funded us Culpepper a whole range of funders but are they interested in specific projects or are they interested in the program I guess they're interested in they have programs of their own and if you can fit your project into their general guidelines and write a convincing grant you know you can get funded could you give me an example for instance

11:59.716 --> 12:01.940
Well, the NEH Brittle Books Program.

12:02.260 --> 12:03.763
Brittle Books Program.

12:03.783 --> 12:17.305
Right, which is to create preservation quality microfilm for the contents of significant books printed in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

12:19.047 --> 12:23.715
And just interestingly enough, the Brittle Books do kind of fall into that.

12:24.286 --> 12:26.409
chronological period, don't they?

12:26.429 --> 12:29.213
The ones prior to that are in great shape.

12:29.554 --> 12:30.595
That's right.

12:30.615 --> 12:44.836
And we found with our Southeast Asian holdings that up through to today they're becoming brittle very quickly because of the lignin content of the paper used in Southeast Asia.

12:44.876 --> 12:49.763
We're finding books as recent as 20 years are now brittle.

12:49.883 --> 12:53.989
So we have moved our microfilming for

12:54.121 --> 12:56.285
Southeast Asian material up to about 1970.

12:56.305 --> 12:58.609
And this is all done on site?

12:58.629 --> 12:59.551
You do this all here?

12:59.571 --> 13:01.654
No, we outsource our microfilming.

13:02.456 --> 13:07.565
We also convert the material via preservation photocopy.

13:07.605 --> 13:09.328
Some of that is done in-house.

13:09.663 --> 13:15.690
and thus this entered us into an investigation in the use of digital technology.

13:15.970 --> 13:30.667
So all of this is by background to say that we had bought the program of copying the contents of volumes that were endangered as a way of preserving the information that they contained.

13:34.232 --> 13:38.877
And so when Xerox Corporation came to us in 1989,

13:39.346 --> 13:53.583
to look at a joint demonstration project to use their prototype scanning system to capture the contents of brittle books and produce paper facsimiles of high quality.

13:54.224 --> 14:00.291
We were interested because of the drawbacks of microfilm, which is

14:00.929 --> 14:15.784
While it's long-lasting and can preserve detail pretty well, it's not real user-friendly, and it's not particularly good for graphic or illustrated material.

14:15.804 --> 14:23.772
Preservation photocopy replicates the codex, but it's a one-for-one process.

14:24.152 --> 14:30.278
Every time you need another copy, you end up doing the labor of copying the book.

14:30.882 --> 14:32.404
page by page.

14:33.385 --> 14:38.411
Scanning is done, and it's analogous to what microfilm is.

14:38.532 --> 14:49.966
Once you've created your preservation master, you can create other copies, and with digital technology, with absolute fidelity to the original master.

14:50.046 --> 14:55.933
Is there a contact person at Xerox that could tell me about this program that you can think of?

14:55.953 --> 14:59.758
Bill Croca, and C-R-O-C-C-A,

15:00.312 --> 15:03.255
D-O-O-C-C-A, and he's just at zero.

15:03.275 --> 15:06.378
Yeah, and Glenn Alexander may be your best.

15:06.398 --> 15:07.919
Glenn Alexander.

15:07.939 --> 15:15.907
G-L-E-N-N, maybe, Alexander.

15:15.927 --> 15:16.848
Let me see if I have a phone number for Glenn.

15:16.868 --> 15:26.117
The background here is... That we had...

15:26.671 --> 15:32.740
We were heavily involved in a project to reformat material, and we became... To reformat.

15:33.401 --> 15:34.603
That's right, to recopy.

15:34.623 --> 15:35.945
We call it reformat.

15:36.185 --> 15:39.210
All right, just for the tape, so I don't labor over that word.

15:39.390 --> 15:40.712
To reformat material.

15:44.678 --> 15:45.840
Here's a number for Glenn.

15:46.581 --> 15:48.544
I don't know if it's still valid or not.

15:48.564 --> 15:51.248
716-777-3326.

15:51.408 --> 15:54.473
And that's at Xerox?

15:54.813 --> 15:56.155
Yes, in Rochester.

15:56.708 --> 16:04.006
And I can say you gave me his name.

16:10.042 --> 16:13.350
We had looked at scanning as an opportunity

16:14.022 --> 16:28.389
Prior to the Xerox context and the quality of the scanning resolutions in the mid-'80s was not sufficient for replacement purposes, which is what we were interested in in a preservation context.

16:31.936 --> 16:35.322
The mid-'80s is almost the incunabulum period of this.

16:35.858 --> 16:38.722
Well, scanning technology's been around for a while.

16:39.082 --> 16:54.342
It was coupled with OCR technology for a long time, and the use of digital images, which was the raw digital file that was used for OCRing, was pretty much a byproduct rather than the primary product at that time.

16:55.083 --> 16:59.048
But with the increase in personal computing, high bandwidth

16:59.315 --> 17:13.610
high-speed networks, high-production, high-quality scanning systems, and particularly with the advent of the World Wide Web, we see digital image technology really coming more into its own, in the 90s particularly.

17:14.370 --> 17:22.959
It's got a lot of applications in government and in business, back-file conversion sorts of things to optical imaging systems.

17:23.760 --> 17:25.862
And within universities,
