WEBVTT

00:02.596 --> 00:03.036
What?

00:03.217 --> 00:10.623
Why don't you just tell me your name again so I can... They are supposed to create a young people's section.

00:10.643 --> 00:11.764
Yes, but tell me your name.

00:12.225 --> 00:12.785
Oh, my name.

00:13.666 --> 00:16.188
Why don't you write it down for me?

00:16.208 --> 00:17.430
Do you mind?

00:17.450 --> 00:32.063
No, I'm interested in collections development and readers and... So you're a librarian?

00:32.684 --> 00:35.047
And you're from France.

00:35.748 --> 00:36.990
And what did you do in France?

00:38.672 --> 00:45.441
For the moment, I am at school in ANSIB, which is the French National School for Librarians.

00:47.644 --> 00:48.766
What's the name of it again?

00:48.786 --> 00:50.348
ANSIB.

00:51.770 --> 00:52.951
E-N-S-S-I-B.

00:54.173 --> 00:56.296
And that's the French National School for Librarians.

00:56.396 --> 00:58.118
Yeah.

00:58.553 --> 01:01.116
OK, so you're studying to be a librarian?

01:01.556 --> 01:07.162
Yeah, and during the study, we have to make a training, and I have to choose this one.

01:07.182 --> 01:08.944
Oh, cool.

01:09.925 --> 01:14.090
In your studies, to be a librarian, is the focus on technology now?

01:14.550 --> 01:22.579
Yeah, there's a big, big, big focus on technologies, of computers, of information systems, and so on, yeah.

01:23.039 --> 01:25.862
But how about books, the printed book?

01:25.903 --> 01:26.383
About?

01:26.532 --> 01:32.397
the importance of the printed book, is that still a matter of... About the numerization, things like that?

01:32.537 --> 01:51.373
Well, in terms of philosophically, the book as opposed to technology, as opposed to computers... Well, in fact, there is not really a study about such a philosophical thing.

01:51.393 --> 01:56.117
We are most supposed to be, how to say that, technicians,

01:56.722 --> 02:09.921
Well, we have to know how those things work, but not exactly how to create them.

02:11.123 --> 02:13.026
So tell me then what you're doing here.

02:13.727 --> 02:17.633
You said you're working with young people in terms of people or the literature?

02:18.294 --> 02:20.637
No, about the young people section.

02:21.005 --> 02:25.353
It is a section for people between 14 and 18 years old.

02:25.393 --> 02:26.616
At this library?

02:27.337 --> 02:28.640
Yeah, in this library.

02:29.441 --> 02:36.735
It will be a 20,000 books collection on 400...

02:37.390 --> 02:39.313
I don't know how to say it.

02:39.333 --> 02:39.614
Metters?

02:39.774 --> 02:41.557
Metters, sure.

02:41.678 --> 02:45.865
And this section will be in Arabic, French and English.

02:46.907 --> 02:49.311
Well, let's talk a little bit about them.

02:49.371 --> 02:51.234
Let's not waste any time then if we can.

02:54.240 --> 03:00.871
Let's have a cup of tea and coffee.

03:00.891 --> 03:01.913
You got time yourself?

03:02.112 --> 03:07.565
I have time, but the interview for me is most important to be able to write my article.

03:07.606 --> 03:11.555
Before you, before you... Talking to Dr. Zarey.

03:12.317 --> 03:12.959
Alexandria.

03:13.520 --> 03:17.590
So tell me a little bit about how is the collection development going right now?

03:18.464 --> 03:20.606
The collection development is going well.

03:20.886 --> 03:36.081
We have a feasibility study, collection development policy that has been established with the support of a few UNESCO experts and through two symposia that were held in the last couple of years.

03:37.422 --> 03:45.450
And collection development follows two

03:45.987 --> 04:14.897
major sections one is the acquisition through purchase and acquisitions through gifts and this we get both that specially those books traditional or electronic that deal with the various interests of the library objectives

04:15.164 --> 04:42.830
were first concentrate on Alexandria, the city, the city and the region, the city, history, past, present, and the future in mind, I'm talking about comprehensive, comprehensive future development of the city, and then Egypt as a general circle, bigger circle, then the Mediterranean.

04:42.990 --> 04:44.952
We Mediterranean

04:45.168 --> 05:10.652
has two circles, the circle of the Middle East and the circle of Europe because always the library of Alexandria in history served this region that was the lighthouse of knowledge for the region and the giving of that library has helped the development of this region during the olden age, during the Ptolemic and

05:10.885 --> 05:38.597
the roman era when the library ended or was destroyed and took various phase of destruction by the end of the fourth century but the giving of that library continued the giving of the scholars of that library the knowledge that they give the world that we know about so even though the building itself ceased to exist but the illumination the illumination

05:38.881 --> 05:43.067
The illumination of the building continued until today.

05:43.789 --> 06:03.239
Something that is recognized when you say Einstein, when he was prepared to announce his theory of relativity back in the late teens, 1918, 1919, he found that some of his calculations contradicted with the theories of Euclides of Alexandria.

06:03.980 --> 06:07.285
And he postponed it so he will be in harmony with history.

06:07.619 --> 06:12.284
So there's continuity of past and present and the future.

06:12.484 --> 06:22.615
Do you hope to be a center for primary scholarship in terms of attracting scholars, as the ancient library did, to do primary research here?

06:22.635 --> 06:26.899
Do you expect to have that kind of depth in your collections?

06:26.919 --> 06:30.203
This is the idea when we talk about the revival of the ancient library.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.385
We're not reviving the building.

06:32.405 --> 06:36.850
We're reviving the idea of excellence in scholarship, excellence in knowledge

06:38.095 --> 07:07.748
And we hope this, when we say the library will serve the region, scholars, not only from the region, from other parts of the world, who are interested in the collection that's related to this region, the collection that relates to the region, will have a state of uniqueness that will make it a heaven for them, for scholars, to do their, what you call, unique research, that will be published by the library itself, and be in contact with the state of the art, through the state of the art,

07:08.133 --> 07:12.840
systems and networks to all nodes of information around the world.

07:13.621 --> 07:19.530
So the information won't necessarily, the primary sources won't necessarily have to be here physically in Alexandria.

07:19.550 --> 07:20.552
You don't have to be here.

07:20.692 --> 07:21.994
You can reach out, as you say.

07:22.014 --> 07:22.394
Yes, yes.

07:23.296 --> 07:25.399
Because we're talking about globalization now.

07:25.419 --> 07:27.502
We're talking about a global village.

07:28.443 --> 07:32.149
Now, knowledge has no place of its own.

07:33.158 --> 07:36.962
The borders of time and place have disappeared, whether we like it or not.

07:37.002 --> 07:37.983
This is a fact of life.

07:38.684 --> 07:41.788
We're talking about internet, information superhighway.

07:41.948 --> 07:43.630
What do you mean by information superhighway?

07:45.992 --> 07:54.281
The event in Washington or in Tokyo, the events, the information reaches you instantaneously.

07:55.062 --> 07:58.666
So place and time becomes of no relevance.

07:59.307 --> 08:02.170
How about the role of the printed book in this?

08:02.504 --> 08:07.251
It will continue to be, especially for scholarship.

08:07.271 --> 08:08.113
Especially for scholarship.

08:08.173 --> 08:19.290
A scholar still refers to information, to maps, to details that he could not get by internet, say, by patient search.

08:20.292 --> 08:24.698
And the prize of a scholar is through the search, not the result.

08:24.758 --> 08:26.381
The result is the end of a long search.

08:27.643 --> 08:30.267
It's like

08:30.871 --> 08:34.215
It's like saying daylight.

08:34.255 --> 08:40.544
Daylight doesn't come at dawn without a process happening before it.

08:40.584 --> 08:42.927
A daylight is an event.

08:44.268 --> 08:46.031
Through a procedure, a process happens.

08:47.052 --> 08:50.977
Work, research work, as an university professor myself.

08:51.578 --> 09:00.169
My joy is in searching through the knowledge and synthesizing all the bits of information.

09:00.503 --> 09:04.468
Is it your hope that this will be a great research library?

09:05.389 --> 09:09.894
It will take time to not be at the time of inauguration.

09:10.155 --> 09:10.976
Give it its time.

09:11.637 --> 09:17.404
The baby has a promise of this newly born baby.

09:17.904 --> 09:21.589
The new biblioteca Alexandrina has a promise of genius.

09:22.430 --> 09:23.070
Wonderful quote.

09:23.972 --> 09:25.153
I love it.

09:25.173 --> 09:25.513
Excellent.

09:27.095 --> 09:29.278
And based on its history,

09:30.018 --> 09:34.047
that will catapult it to new horizons, undreamt of.

09:36.614 --> 09:40.603
You see, a promise of genius might even be the title of the chapter, by the way.

09:40.703 --> 09:41.906
I'm looking for it.

09:41.926 --> 09:42.467
I don't know.

09:42.527 --> 09:44.753
I'm seeing my book as we talk, you see.

09:45.334 --> 09:48.702
How large of a collection do you

09:49.306 --> 09:50.167
plan to have?

09:50.287 --> 09:50.688
What do you think?

09:50.728 --> 09:52.390
The opening will be around 350.

09:53.131 --> 09:54.633
We have it already, by the way.

09:54.653 --> 09:55.694
350,000?

09:56.215 --> 09:56.435
Yes.

09:56.735 --> 09:56.916
Here?

09:57.296 --> 09:57.496
Yes.

09:58.197 --> 09:59.699
Not here in the site, but elsewhere?

10:00.180 --> 10:02.683
Well, we've processed things here.

10:02.703 --> 10:03.344
We have the process.

10:03.364 --> 10:06.127
We have been from local area networks processed.

10:06.148 --> 10:12.436
So it will be hooked, migrated to the new system, information system, and stored in the conference center next to the library.

10:12.456 --> 10:13.998
So it's in the conference center, yes.

10:14.018 --> 10:15.580
With the storage places they have.

10:15.680 --> 10:18.283
Not in the halls themselves, but they are

10:18.533 --> 10:22.517
storage places next to it, around it, in the annexes next to it.

10:22.537 --> 10:23.779
And taken care of there.

10:25.440 --> 10:27.242
We have also a unique collection already.

10:27.303 --> 10:40.517
We have just one, the municipality library, a unique collection from the special Arab scholars in various fields, in chemistry, physics, theology, biology, medicine, astronomy.

10:40.537 --> 10:41.698
This is a unique collection?

10:41.718 --> 10:42.259
Unique collection.

10:42.419 --> 10:45.282
Already the governor has given that collection.

10:45.422 --> 10:46.904
The governor of Alexandria.

10:46.924 --> 10:48.085
Of Alexandria.

10:48.318 --> 10:51.583
A collection that has already been built up over a period of years?

10:51.743 --> 10:53.465
Yes, yes.

10:53.505 --> 10:57.251
And this comprises how many volumes, would you say, approximately?

10:57.271 --> 10:58.332
Altogether about 10,000.

10:58.352 --> 11:00.675
And what's the name of it again?

11:00.735 --> 11:02.258
Municipality Library Collection.

11:02.278 --> 11:04.200
Municipality Library Collection.

11:04.781 --> 11:10.950
So already you have something that is... Yes, we have it already in our custody now.

11:11.370 --> 11:16.097
Because we have promised to maintain it, to restore it,

11:16.280 --> 11:20.886
to conserve it because it was in a full collection, full space over there.

11:21.547 --> 11:23.910
I had to spend money on it to preserve it.

11:23.930 --> 11:24.871
And to make it accessible.

11:24.891 --> 11:25.792
And to make it accessible.

11:25.812 --> 11:27.735
Which is just as important as everything.

11:27.755 --> 11:28.476
And digitize it.

11:28.496 --> 11:29.757
Oh, you're going to digitize it.

11:29.778 --> 11:31.039
We're working on digitizing.

11:31.059 --> 11:32.161
Microfilming?

11:32.181 --> 11:32.401
Yes.

11:32.621 --> 11:34.564
Microfilm is very important, and it's very good.

11:34.604 --> 11:35.485
This is the first thing.

11:35.505 --> 11:37.347
Microfilming, then digitizing.

11:37.367 --> 11:45.578
I've been to Cornell University for this project, of course, where they are using digitization as a mode of preservation.

11:45.912 --> 11:51.919
And it's very, very controversial, of course, because we don't know how long digital material will last.

11:51.939 --> 11:54.683
So we have the original material.

11:55.103 --> 11:56.184
We have it on microfilm.

11:57.306 --> 11:59.248
And for microfilm, we change it to digital.

11:59.368 --> 12:00.730
We'll see how it works.

12:00.990 --> 12:04.014
But you always have the original as a protection.

12:04.034 --> 12:06.777
Yes, because everybody says digital library is a good touch.

12:07.358 --> 12:09.641
But for how long can you guarantee it?

12:09.661 --> 12:10.802
It's a new thing.

12:10.822 --> 12:11.603
Nobody can claim.

12:11.743 --> 12:12.464
They say 100 years.

12:13.525 --> 12:14.046
Who knows?

12:14.650 --> 12:19.296
We have things in the United States now that, after 20 years, is useless.

12:20.097 --> 12:31.550
When we sent space probes out to take pictures of the planets, the Viking material, 30% of that material is useless now because it's on magnetic tape, which is degraded.

12:31.570 --> 12:35.876
I'll be writing about this in my book.

12:36.316 --> 12:37.177
I've traveled the world.

12:37.237 --> 12:42.784
I've been to Leipzig, where they are working on mass deacidification, for instance.

12:43.203 --> 12:44.304
Very, very interesting.

12:44.364 --> 12:47.407
But of course, the promise of genius is very important.

12:47.427 --> 12:49.430
Tell me a little bit about the design of the library.

12:49.450 --> 12:50.771
Is it a symbolic design?

12:50.831 --> 12:51.111
Yes.

12:51.131 --> 13:07.329
Well, really, I should say I'm lucky to have been involved in this project since its infancy, pre-creation, since pre-creation, back in the 84, 85.

13:08.510 --> 13:11.573
And I also was involved in

13:12.430 --> 13:17.275
in the development of the program, which is called the architectural brief.

13:18.257 --> 13:21.921
And I was also a member of the jury that selected the design.

13:21.941 --> 13:26.226
It was an international architecture competition that was held back in 1988.

13:27.507 --> 13:35.496
And the jury, international jury, selected the winning design from 1,400 participants from 77 nations.

13:38.639 --> 13:40.041
The jury of 11 people.

13:40.561 --> 13:59.395
which included the IUA, people from the States, Japan, Europe, we include England, France, Germany, Italy, Egypt, and Japan.

14:00.357 --> 14:04.965
So we selected this winning design by a Norwegian team, young people.

14:05.840 --> 14:09.965
They won over big offices around the world with young people.

14:09.985 --> 14:11.167
This is the promise of the future.

14:11.187 --> 14:11.948
This is exciting.

14:12.088 --> 14:13.329
I love it.

14:13.409 --> 14:19.177
Young people can really overwhelm the long, established, big offices.

14:19.197 --> 14:21.660
That's what a library is all about, isn't it?

14:21.840 --> 14:22.941
For the future.

14:22.961 --> 14:24.203
The promise of the future.

14:24.223 --> 14:25.144
Yes.

14:25.164 --> 14:26.466
And they want it.

14:26.666 --> 14:27.807
This idea is the idea.

14:27.887 --> 14:31.392
The idea is that attracted the joy.

14:31.412 --> 14:34.416
Not a functional, classic building.

14:34.436 --> 14:35.577
The idea wants something.

14:36.113 --> 15:05.175
a building that would defy time a building that would also pay homage to the heritage that will carry the torch of the ancient library through its conception the idea of its conception so their conception was this circle a huge circle, 160 meters in diameter

15:05.678 --> 15:12.465
that's tipped toward the eastern harbor, which is also circular.

15:12.545 --> 15:13.366
Which is also what?

15:13.386 --> 15:13.967
Circular.

15:14.447 --> 15:15.368
Circular, yes.

15:16.710 --> 15:20.073
And the world is circular, and we dance around in circles.

15:20.834 --> 15:23.016
And our mind is circular in shape.

15:24.618 --> 15:26.199
And our eyes are circular.

15:30.444 --> 15:31.585
And the sun is circular.

15:35.041 --> 15:46.876
And it is tipped, and part of it is hidden underground to give you the idea, an incline, a circle like that one, to give you the idea of a perpetual sunrise.

15:48.218 --> 15:50.021
May I take your picture while you're talking, by the way?

15:50.381 --> 15:50.882
Do you mind?

15:51.583 --> 15:52.624
Yes, please.

15:52.644 --> 15:54.086
Like a perpetual sunrise.

15:54.807 --> 15:59.513
Because if you see the whole disk above ground, you would say the sun has risen, becomes past tense.

16:01.585 --> 16:07.833
But because it is hidden, partly hidden, below ground circle.

16:09.095 --> 16:17.225
Partly hidden below ground level, you would say it is, the sun is rising.

16:18.026 --> 16:21.451
Because part of it is hidden, as a continual sunrise.

16:23.233 --> 16:31.103
And the circle will also, through its being associated with

16:31.657 --> 16:40.067
forms that will remain with us, with human beings, for generations and for centuries to come.

16:40.087 --> 16:43.652
The sun will continue to be circular.

16:43.672 --> 16:47.637
Did the Norwegian architects articulate this?

16:48.338 --> 16:49.379
No, I could see it in it.

16:49.459 --> 16:51.582
I could see it as a judge.

16:52.903 --> 16:53.624
I could see it in it.

16:53.644 --> 16:54.625
Yes, this is wonderful.

16:55.206 --> 16:58.991
I could see it in it because this idea is a promise.

16:59.011 --> 16:59.892
The promise.

17:00.580 --> 17:27.330
and in terms of functionality so this is the circle and when they show the circle also they have the moon next to it the sun is the library the moon is the planetarium which is the foreground in this picture so you have this play of two things the high and the low the perfect then the imperfect the complete then incomplete

17:27.985 --> 17:29.406
The present and the future.

17:29.587 --> 17:31.028
The future is incomplete.

17:31.048 --> 17:34.011
The present is the complete one.

17:34.031 --> 17:36.334
It touches too.

17:36.354 --> 17:39.637
The linkage, the twilight of time, the twilight of space.

17:39.657 --> 17:40.077
Wonderful.

17:40.938 --> 17:49.667
So, we have chosen a design that will not be a fad or a fashion.

17:49.687 --> 17:50.708
A fad is the word.

17:50.728 --> 17:51.129
Yes.

17:51.849 --> 17:54.312
It will not be fashionable for some time.

17:54.993 --> 17:57.435
Like, you know, so many designs are fashionable today.

17:58.647 --> 17:59.869
But how about tomorrow?

17:59.889 --> 18:06.137
We want something that will come to a generation that we will also identify with and keep it and uphold it.

18:07.078 --> 18:13.567
So this library is as important for its symbolic value as it is for its function.

18:13.947 --> 18:16.751
Would you agree with that?

18:18.413 --> 18:19.454
It carries both together.

18:19.494 --> 18:21.857
You cannot separate because it is oneness.

18:22.919 --> 18:25.983
The circle is oneness.

18:26.003 --> 18:27.625
Function and form are

18:28.128 --> 18:29.729
Oneness.

18:30.050 --> 18:31.331
You cannot separate them together.

18:31.751 --> 18:35.495
Go inside under this circular roof, which is like a microchip, by the way.

18:35.855 --> 18:36.395
Very interesting.

18:36.415 --> 18:38.517
When you look at it.

18:38.998 --> 18:40.359
It is a cascade of levels.

18:40.980 --> 18:41.840
A cascade of what?

18:41.860 --> 18:42.901
Of levels, yes.

18:42.921 --> 18:44.463
When you look inside, a cascade of levels.

18:44.923 --> 18:46.945
An open buffet of knowledge.

18:46.965 --> 18:55.873
Ascora will be like a bee moving from one flower to another, from one field to the next.

18:56.157 --> 19:02.003
where the accommodations of scholars are accommodated at the top, are placed on top.

19:05.627 --> 19:09.911
Like the higher you go, the highest level is where the scholars will be.

19:10.312 --> 19:12.734
The higher you go, supposedly, the more you know.

19:13.916 --> 19:15.938
The levels, the cascade of levels.

19:15.958 --> 19:18.841
And this is actually, you think this will operate in practice?

19:18.921 --> 19:20.342
Yes, this is what it has designed.

19:20.362 --> 19:21.484
The accommodations are there.

19:21.784 --> 19:23.886
The cells from the scholars are there.

19:24.524 --> 19:31.756
So really, the more advanced the level of scholarship, the higher level you will be occupying.

19:31.896 --> 19:36.664
Yes, and the more horizons you will see, because the higher you will see the horizons.

19:36.684 --> 19:39.469
Was this again the idea of the architect?

19:39.569 --> 19:40.470
I could see it in it.

19:40.571 --> 19:42.334
I could see it in actuality.

19:43.576 --> 19:44.157
It's wonderful.

19:45.078 --> 19:48.384
And this is the building itself.

19:48.484 --> 19:50.447
The library of Alexandria is not

19:51.153 --> 19:54.337
You see, all libraries have separate holes.

19:54.417 --> 19:54.958
What I'm sorry?

19:54.978 --> 19:55.299
Separate.

19:55.419 --> 19:56.080
Separate holes.

19:56.200 --> 19:56.881
Separate?

19:56.901 --> 19:57.461
Holes.

19:57.481 --> 19:57.922
Holes.

19:58.022 --> 20:02.308
You know, this library for the old library for the recession, library for the audio people.

20:03.650 --> 20:05.753
All libraries have holes.

20:06.614 --> 20:08.496
Various holes or reading rooms.

20:08.516 --> 20:09.037
Reading rooms.

20:09.498 --> 20:12.081
This is for maps, this is for this, this is for that.

20:13.023 --> 20:15.366
So really, scholars don't feel each other.

20:15.626 --> 20:19.890
Everybody is separated in his little hall or reading hall.

20:20.411 --> 20:27.599
And this you could see in the British Library, in the Library of Congress, in the new French Library.

20:30.122 --> 20:33.445
But this one is an open buffet.

20:33.906 --> 20:35.728
There is no separation.

20:36.629 --> 20:37.590
There is no separation.

20:38.471 --> 20:39.672
The young can see the old.

20:40.428 --> 20:41.609
Not this, you need this.

20:41.630 --> 20:43.512
And they can also aspire to rise.

20:43.552 --> 20:43.632
Yes.

20:44.653 --> 20:44.974
Always.

20:45.555 --> 20:45.795
Yes.

20:45.815 --> 20:54.546
This is one of the important, shall I say, strivings of man.

20:56.308 --> 20:56.468
Yes.

20:56.609 --> 20:58.411
The seven strivings of man.

20:59.452 --> 20:59.532
Yes.

20:59.552 --> 21:02.396
Number four is identity.

21:03.838 --> 21:05.720
The seven strivings of man.

21:05.740 --> 21:05.900
Yes.

21:06.121 --> 21:07.062
That's very interesting.

21:07.122 --> 21:08.624
I'm not familiar with that.

21:08.744 --> 21:09.625
I'll check that out.

21:10.195 --> 21:14.481
By Maslow, he was a sociologist who wrote about it.

21:14.821 --> 21:19.368
You know, the basic thing, the first thing was security, protection.

21:19.408 --> 21:21.070
Who wrote about it again?

21:21.090 --> 21:22.552
It's a theory by Maslow.

21:22.592 --> 21:23.493
M-A-S-L-O-W.

21:25.055 --> 21:26.637
M-A-S-L-O-W.

21:29.061 --> 21:32.445
You know, the basic things, you know, your protection, security.

21:33.407 --> 21:35.009
Secure, away from threats.

21:36.010 --> 21:37.072
So self-preservation.

21:37.793 --> 21:38.093
Food.

21:38.663 --> 22:01.532
shelter you know and then and of course preservation of kind this is one of like you know the basic thing procreation yeah then then identification achievements want to to do better better more you are not always content with this

22:01.968 --> 22:02.349
That's it.

22:02.389 --> 22:05.213
Otherwise, what's the purpose of it all?

22:05.233 --> 22:06.816
This is part of striving.

22:08.098 --> 22:12.405
What was your reaction when you heard about this project, this new project?

22:13.387 --> 22:17.975
What was your response when it was proposed to do this new biblioteca?

22:18.275 --> 22:27.891
You see, I was from the beginning there in the preparatory committee, because we have been always in the Library of Alexandria, in the University of Alexandria, I'm a professor of university.

22:28.107 --> 22:36.380
No, the role of the library, the ancient library, we are in the vicinity of its history, of its giving to the world.

22:37.282 --> 22:43.231
We wanted its, what you call, renaissance.

22:44.553 --> 22:45.054
Renaissance.

22:47.237 --> 22:54.569
Alexandria deserves to be a special place because of its history.

22:54.589 --> 22:55.330
It defied time.

22:55.900 --> 22:59.143
It is one of the oldest planned living cities in the world.

22:59.163 --> 22:59.523
Planned.

23:00.524 --> 23:02.566
Planned, had a plan by the Necrotees.

23:02.906 --> 23:04.167
Absolutely.

23:04.187 --> 23:05.689
I never thought of it, but it's absolutely true.

23:05.709 --> 23:09.852
One of the oldest planned living cities, and we know how the Necrotees did it.

23:10.493 --> 23:11.834
We know how we have the plan already.

23:12.895 --> 23:19.861
So one of the oldest planned, it was a planned city built according to a plan, and living cities.

23:20.762 --> 23:23.865
And it suffered a great deal.

23:24.048 --> 23:27.834
through many civilizations that passed in it through it.

23:27.854 --> 23:33.263
Went through the process of birth, growth, maturity, but not death, birth again.

23:34.666 --> 23:34.966
See that?

23:35.407 --> 23:36.268
The sign curve?

23:36.288 --> 23:37.691
Yes.

23:38.652 --> 23:42.118
Let the tape record note that the professor just did a sign curve.

23:42.459 --> 23:43.781
What do you teach at the university?

23:43.801 --> 23:45.223
What is your field?

23:46.305 --> 23:49.330
I'm basically architect, planner.

23:49.900 --> 23:56.229
Do you have a CV that I could have for your background that would help you in life?

23:56.249 --> 23:57.030
Yes.

23:57.310 --> 24:01.657
CV 30.

24:02.057 --> 24:10.589
I don't want to bother to ask you that.

24:10.689 --> 24:13.393
I think it will all be contained in the CV.

24:16.798 --> 24:19.722
We're covering a lot of brown, by the way, which is very good.

24:20.866 --> 24:23.710
So we're talking about the spirit of, this will be a gig.

24:23.730 --> 24:27.975
You know, I was thinking, looking out my hotel window, the arms of the harbor.

24:27.995 --> 24:33.222
It's almost like a welcoming embrace, the way the harbor and the lighthouse out there.

24:33.262 --> 24:33.763
Oh, my goodness.

24:34.083 --> 24:36.727
You echoed my thoughts.

24:36.807 --> 24:39.050
I've always expressed what you've said there.

24:39.070 --> 24:39.670
Is that right?

24:39.690 --> 24:39.891
Yes.

24:40.391 --> 24:43.195
They said, you see, in the harbor of Alexander, the eastern harbor,

24:43.951 --> 24:47.576
And this harbor is from Alexander's time.

24:47.596 --> 24:48.898
It was the eastern harbor.

24:48.918 --> 24:50.460
It was the main harbor, by the way.

24:50.500 --> 24:52.203
And now it's recreational harbor.

24:52.423 --> 24:55.027
The western harbor is a commercial harbor.

24:55.047 --> 24:58.171
Yes, in the harbor, you can see the Cai Bay fortress.

24:58.211 --> 24:59.173
The fortress Cai Bay.

24:59.433 --> 25:03.639
This has been built in the place where the Ferris Lighthouse.

25:03.659 --> 25:09.567
I went out there last night just to feel it, just to absorb the ambiance of the place.

25:09.587 --> 25:11.410
The Ferris Lighthouse was there.

25:11.609 --> 25:34.849
and some of the stones have been used also in the building in the fortress so I always say you see the library is here and this is the breakwater and this is the Feros lighthouse this is the Feros location and this is the library location is in here so I always say I always say this that

25:35.909 --> 25:40.756
The fortress Kite Bay is located at the western arm of the harbor.

25:40.776 --> 25:43.400
The western arm of the harbor.

25:44.622 --> 25:48.649
The western arm of the harbor guarding the body, the fortress.

25:49.530 --> 25:57.462
And the rival of Alexandria is standing at the tip of the eastern arm guarding the spirit and the mind.

25:58.454 --> 26:04.122
And that is the Alexandrian library of today, and also the ancient one, because you were very close to the original site, aren't you?

26:04.243 --> 26:07.908
Almost in the royal quarter where the ancient one once stood.

26:08.068 --> 26:11.774
So physically, and then we think of the symbolism of the light.

26:11.794 --> 26:13.897
You had the lighthouse, which was a beacon.

26:14.858 --> 26:20.807
It would project rays, inviting people, scholars, to come.

26:21.048 --> 26:23.331
And here you are, you have a reflecting object.

26:23.547 --> 26:24.007
Yes.

26:24.027 --> 26:27.011
Which is to receive that light and then reflect it.

26:27.031 --> 26:28.592
The symbolism is continuous, isn't it?

26:28.612 --> 26:29.253
Continuous, yes.

26:29.693 --> 26:30.935
This is the way I saw it, I see it.

26:30.975 --> 26:49.133
That's why when we had just two weeks ago in the conference center, which is functioning, by the way, we've had it functioning for the last five, six years with conferences and performances and all of this, we had just two weeks ago the first annual

26:49.990 --> 26:51.912
We are functioning already as a library.

26:52.113 --> 26:56.598
First annual Bibliotheca Alexandrina symposium.

26:56.618 --> 27:00.502
And the title is the Bibliotheca Alexandrina Continuum.

27:00.522 --> 27:00.943
Yes.

27:00.963 --> 27:03.907
I have two chapters in my new book called Continuum.

27:04.427 --> 27:05.629
This is perfect.

27:06.389 --> 27:14.659
What do you see as the role, the function of the library, not just the Bibliotheca Alexandrina, but the library in the 21st century?

27:14.719 --> 27:19.525
Is it the same as it has always been, or is it acquiring a new role and new function?

27:19.758 --> 27:32.894
You see, the library of Alexandria of today and the future, of course, is not really a traditional library in terms of components.

27:32.914 --> 27:35.817
This is a unique bibliothèque Alexandria.

27:35.958 --> 27:37.019
Don't say, like what?

27:37.600 --> 27:38.761
Don't compare it to another.

27:39.662 --> 27:42.205
This is one and the one.

27:45.009 --> 27:47.892
It had in it, of course, as I said, yes, the various

27:48.563 --> 27:50.485
The various roots of knowledge are there.

27:51.906 --> 27:59.794
Literature, art, science and technology, philosophy, social sciences, you name it.

28:01.236 --> 28:02.997
And it has accommodations for scholars.

28:03.978 --> 28:17.592
It has the international school for information studies, preparing for the staffing and for the people dealing with the information technology, where in the age coming millennium is the technotronic age.

28:17.791 --> 28:18.512
as they call it.

28:20.433 --> 28:23.176
It has in it the planetarium and the science museum.

28:24.297 --> 28:31.183
It has also in it the museum, the science museum is for the achievements of sciences.

28:32.244 --> 28:37.869
But we have the museum of the pieces of archaeology that we found at the site will be displayed there.

28:38.610 --> 28:45.216
We have calligraphy museum and the institute of calligraphy because the art of writing started in this region.

28:45.871 --> 28:48.374
It has state-of-the-art information system.

28:48.554 --> 28:57.566
It is one of the most modern in the world now, even more advanced than the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, because it will be multilingual and multi-alphabet.

28:59.008 --> 29:00.550
You were talking about the computer system now?

29:00.570 --> 29:01.651
Yes, the information system.

29:03.033 --> 29:11.524
That's the information system, which will be hooked to other nodes of information across the Mediterranean, in Europe, and across to

29:12.415 --> 29:13.717
America and Japan.

29:13.737 --> 29:14.518
Everywhere in the world.

29:14.638 --> 29:15.199
Yes.

29:15.540 --> 29:16.681
Information superhighway.

29:17.382 --> 29:17.943
Hyperway.

29:18.845 --> 29:19.486
Hyperway now.

29:20.367 --> 29:22.450
So it is a different role.

29:23.191 --> 29:25.014
Because the means are different.

29:26.115 --> 29:27.498
And the users are different.

29:28.840 --> 29:29.941
And the world is different.

29:31.604 --> 29:41.258
So what we are reviving in the new building is the idea of the excellence in knowledge.

29:41.778 --> 29:46.883
duplicating any other library or duplicating any other research institution.

29:47.524 --> 29:51.628
It is par excellence the new Bibliotheca Alexandrina.

29:52.689 --> 29:59.015
That will help, especially in this region, the cultural development.

29:59.135 --> 30:07.063
So through which we're talking about change of pace, change of thoughts, change of attitude, tolerance, cooperation, peace, understanding.

30:08.184 --> 30:10.907
And through this sound socio-economic

30:12.035 --> 30:15.381
development can be instituted on solid basis.

30:17.505 --> 30:27.844
And the experience, if I may say, the experience of Iran when the Shah spent so much on economic development.

30:29.287 --> 30:31.170
But the mind wasn't ready for it.

30:31.551 --> 30:35.578
It stopped.

30:36.031 --> 30:38.814
I said it again, it was clear.

30:39.194 --> 30:40.816
The mind wasn't ready for it.

30:40.956 --> 30:58.596
So if you establish this, means the cultural and social development, attitudes, then sound socio-economic development can take place, can be instituted on a solid basis.

30:58.616 --> 31:01.279
Bridges of understanding, bridges of cooperation.

31:02.079 --> 31:04.502
This is the UNDP, this is Rez Reb once said,

31:05.258 --> 31:35.147
UNDP and his event program in Cairo will be the window not only of Egypt but of Africa and the region toward the north window of not only Egypt but Africa as a Middle East toward the north toward Europe and this will linkage between the north and the south the east and the west and of course the the participation of the United Nations really

31:35.600 --> 31:38.203
has great symbolic value as well, doesn't it?

31:38.283 --> 31:38.363
Yes.

31:38.383 --> 31:39.925
UNESCO is supporting us.

31:40.025 --> 31:44.370
We have a treaty, we have an agreement with UNESCO for support of it.

31:44.971 --> 31:47.854
Something that I wonder why the US has stayed away from it.

31:49.236 --> 31:49.916
I don't understand.

31:49.937 --> 31:50.357
I'm wondering.

31:51.178 --> 31:54.041
Just wondering.

31:54.322 --> 31:57.585
And who will administer this library?

31:58.767 --> 32:00.188
It has a board international.

32:00.208 --> 32:01.510
We have already a board.

32:01.530 --> 32:04.053
But I mean, it will not be affiliated with the university or anything.

32:04.073 --> 32:05.134
No, no.

32:05.536 --> 32:06.517
An independent entity.

32:09.441 --> 32:10.782
Why should it be affiliated?

32:10.802 --> 32:11.924
It should be affiliated with.

32:13.445 --> 32:14.106
That's correct, yes.

32:15.788 --> 32:19.513
But it will be an independent, autonomous entity.

32:19.573 --> 32:20.314
Yes, entity.

32:21.976 --> 32:22.596
That's wonderful.

32:23.257 --> 32:27.082
You know, I've taken up a lot of your time, and I think, is there anything else that you feel like?

32:27.142 --> 32:29.945
No, really, this is a message that I would like you to carry.

32:30.085 --> 32:30.305
Yes.

32:31.307 --> 32:34.210
As a torch carrier.

32:35.472 --> 32:38.737
It's my honor to do this.

32:38.837 --> 32:44.565
To people, maybe this generation would read it, maybe coming generation would read it.

32:44.585 --> 32:46.107
But the message will be there.

32:48.490 --> 32:52.716
That it is theirs, it is ours, it is yours.

32:54.519 --> 32:55.780
It's yours like it is ours.

32:56.021 --> 32:57.202
I'm not building it for myself.

32:58.124 --> 33:00.587
I have reached the time already.

33:02.129 --> 33:04.753
I'm working on what you call pastime,

33:05.459 --> 33:10.724
You see, my hair is gray as well.

33:12.406 --> 33:17.771
So I'm doing my job, but this is a promise for the future as well.

33:17.791 --> 33:20.593
And it's more than just, as we say, the 21st century.

33:21.374 --> 33:22.515
It's beyond.

33:22.715 --> 33:25.438
That's why I like about the design.

33:26.399 --> 33:29.642
It is not associated with the fashion of today.

33:30.503 --> 33:32.985
Perhaps 100 years from now,

33:33.877 --> 33:40.364
Lassan will also be popular, as we are domain beings as we are, the circle that is.

33:42.787 --> 33:49.314
And then just briefly, I know you told me about, I think your ultimate capacity, I think you said you project four million volumes, is that about right?

33:49.334 --> 33:49.935
Yes, yes.

33:49.955 --> 33:58.905
And then in terms of the... But the electronic will be more, because electronic would not take... That's right, but you plan to have full electronic...

34:04.201 --> 34:13.444
Thank you so much.

34:13.805 --> 34:19.459
Thank you so much.
