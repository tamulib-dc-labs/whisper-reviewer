WEBVTT

00:04.132 --> 00:05.233
Isn't that cool?

00:06.455 --> 00:07.316
Isn't that great?

00:07.336 --> 00:07.977
That's too cool.

00:07.997 --> 00:08.397
Yes.

00:08.998 --> 00:09.498
That's cool.

00:10.179 --> 00:17.007
So, bricolage, as an activity or a department... B-R-I-C-O-L-H... Oh, goodness.

00:17.027 --> 00:19.390
It's an activity or department store, a do-it-yourself or a bricolage.

00:19.410 --> 00:21.813
It can be a handyman or a do-it-yourself enthusiast.

00:21.833 --> 00:28.621
But in a wider sense, it does mean to cobble together, tinker with objects or indeed concepts, construct something with odds and ends.

00:29.302 --> 00:30.343
That's exactly what I do.

00:30.363 --> 00:31.724
It's what I've always done.

00:31.865 --> 00:32.265
Always?

00:32.380 --> 00:33.581
Even when you started?

00:33.902 --> 00:34.742
Even when I started.

00:34.762 --> 00:37.906
So you weren't actually drawing pictures out of my mind?

00:38.046 --> 00:38.206
No.

00:38.226 --> 00:39.728
You weren't conjuring them out of the air?

00:39.748 --> 00:39.808
No.

00:40.028 --> 00:40.769
You needed things.

00:40.809 --> 00:41.870
I need things to refer to.

00:41.910 --> 00:44.453
Devices, objects, pictures.

00:44.593 --> 00:44.933
Crutches.

00:45.313 --> 00:45.694
Crutches.

00:46.154 --> 00:47.576
I need my crutches.

00:47.836 --> 00:52.981
You see, I don't consider myself, I don't consider anything I've ever done being original.

00:53.001 --> 00:54.543
I'm not concerned about being original.

00:55.144 --> 00:56.805
I'm not concerned about being an artist.

00:56.845 --> 00:58.727
I'm not concerned about any of these things.

00:58.747 --> 01:02.151
It's just not anything that I'm really genuinely concerned about.

01:02.620 --> 01:04.743
If I'm an artist, that's for you to say, not for me to say.

01:05.544 --> 01:09.569
If what I do is original, that's for somebody else to determine, not for me to determine.

01:09.669 --> 01:14.535
All I'm trying to do is make interesting images, and I'll make those interesting any way I can.

01:14.895 --> 01:18.339
And to get there, here.

01:18.480 --> 01:20.883
So tell me some of the things that you've used over the years.

01:20.903 --> 01:23.646
I mean, obviously, this computer was invented with you in mind.

01:23.666 --> 01:30.855
Well, this thing right here has been a sharp SF7800 copy machine that has...

01:31.122 --> 01:33.685
SF-7800.

01:34.646 --> 01:37.951
Which has a zoom that can go up to 200%.

01:38.071 --> 01:38.712
Yeah.

01:39.473 --> 01:39.573
Okay.

01:40.574 --> 01:41.756
That's as much as it'll do.

01:42.136 --> 01:45.741
That computer will do 800% in a single whack.

01:46.882 --> 01:51.388
But if I want to go to 1600%, I just have to go it again, and I can keep that thing going forever.

01:51.408 --> 01:57.656
So these are machines, but the sources of information, so magazines... Sources are anything that I find.

01:58.497 --> 02:00.960
Those are the little bits and pieces that I cobble together.

02:01.261 --> 02:12.599
RISD has a department which is called the clipping file, the picture collection.

02:13.500 --> 02:18.468
And it is an entire floor of the library that has what I have in those five cabinets.

02:18.488 --> 02:19.650
And this is stuff that you've used.

02:19.971 --> 02:21.513
Oh, I go down there all the time.

02:21.533 --> 02:24.518
So you go down there, these are sources that you go down and use.

02:24.768 --> 02:39.207
I want a Near Eastern costume, so I go down and look in their files under costume, costume Middle Eastern, and then I just go through it, and I find characters in costume doing this and doing that.

02:39.227 --> 02:40.028
And you've always done this?

02:40.208 --> 02:40.929
I've always done it.

02:40.949 --> 02:41.690
Children's books?

02:42.071 --> 02:43.152
Children's books, everything.

02:43.172 --> 02:50.522
Can you give me a couple of, of the 230 books, can you give me a couple of interesting examples of things that have inspired you, that have made their way into it?

02:50.958 --> 02:53.080
Just a couple of examples that come to mind.

02:53.120 --> 02:55.142
You mean of famous photographs, maybe?

02:55.382 --> 03:03.209
Well, no, just things that have... So it can be a picture, it's a photograph, and you take that and you appropriate it and... No, it's every one of them.

03:03.249 --> 03:05.811
I mean, there's not a book that I've done that I haven't done that with.

03:07.012 --> 03:18.342
Sometimes it's... Well... Hey, hey, hey, get down from there!

03:18.362 --> 03:18.922
What's that?

03:18.942 --> 03:20.003
Who's Who in the Bible.

03:20.776 --> 03:47.712
exactly because you're taking photographs you're taking photographs of people sure and so these aren't sure and a lot of times I won't be able to find a piece that will do what I want it to do maybe I'll have a head and shoulders of a figure but I won't have the hands doing what I want well then I just draw it you know I can draw so if it comes to that I will do that and if it means to turn you know changing the gesture of a head or

03:47.945 --> 03:51.289
or putting a sword in somebody's hand or something like that.

03:51.530 --> 03:53.312
That's just freehand drawing.

03:54.413 --> 03:55.775
But that's what all these books are for.

03:55.895 --> 04:08.792
All of these books here in the studio, most of them anyway, have to do with costume, resources, foot gear, helmets, arms, armor, all that kind of stuff.

04:09.613 --> 04:11.556
And the books over there are all books of photographs.

04:12.160 --> 04:14.242
You know, this is new.

04:14.362 --> 04:16.204
Has this been written with regard to you?

04:16.264 --> 04:18.847
I don't think they've gotten into this, have they?

04:18.867 --> 04:19.408
Not much.

04:19.428 --> 04:20.469
Well, that's good.

04:20.489 --> 04:31.820
It's an interesting thing to me, though, because a lot of people do this and don't claim it because they're afraid to be accused of being unoriginal, of being derivative.

04:31.841 --> 04:32.641
Well, piss on it.

04:32.661 --> 04:33.262
I don't care.

04:33.282 --> 04:34.163
It doesn't matter to me.

04:34.663 --> 04:41.931
But, like, this is one of my favorite sources, the photographs of people like Doris Ullman.

04:42.518 --> 04:45.442
and Walker Evans.

04:45.462 --> 04:47.125
One of my all-time favorites.

04:47.345 --> 04:49.147
I think I've got all of his books, yeah.

04:49.788 --> 04:51.951
I think I have half of these books that are right here.

04:51.971 --> 04:52.172
Ms.

04:52.212 --> 04:53.233
Welty's photographs.

04:53.313 --> 04:54.535
She was wonderful.

04:54.555 --> 04:56.578
WPA pictures, right?

04:57.419 --> 04:58.461
Beautiful photographs.

04:58.961 --> 05:10.618
In fact, I asked her one time, HBJ asked me to do paintings for a new issue of her fiction in paperback.

05:10.919 --> 05:12.060
Which I, of course, did.

05:12.401 --> 05:17.766
And I ran into her and she had seen them.

05:17.786 --> 05:22.271
And I said, I guess I based every one of them on various elements of her photographs.

05:22.611 --> 05:23.552
Oh, she must have loved that.

05:23.572 --> 05:24.133
Every one of them.

05:24.153 --> 05:28.217
I mean, I take a figure from here and a head from here and put this head on this figure and put this, you know.

05:28.237 --> 05:28.978
Did she notice this?

05:29.799 --> 05:30.239
Yeah.

05:30.259 --> 05:31.861
And I said, I hope you don't mind I did that.

05:32.342 --> 05:35.044
And she said, she clapped her hands together.

05:35.064 --> 05:38.428
She said, oh, Barry, I love what you've done with it.

05:38.797 --> 05:42.985
And she said, you have made my photographs your own images, you know.

05:43.706 --> 05:46.571
And it's what I do.

05:46.591 --> 05:51.440
It's not that I'm paying any disrespect or trying to steal anything from anybody in that sense.

05:51.760 --> 05:56.288
I'm just using, because I'm not, like, for instance, I would never pull off.

05:56.308 --> 05:57.330
I would never do this image.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.334
But I might do that fork.

05:59.855 --> 05:59.995
Mm-hmm.

06:00.059 --> 06:04.527
I might pull a fork out of there, or I might pull this bit of this newspaper out of there, you know.

06:04.768 --> 06:06.431
Just with these couple tines going up.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.535
A couple of tines, yes, just to pick up this light.

06:09.256 --> 06:16.149
I might use an egg or a cap hanging, you know, something that I would never, never go in and do this composition.

06:16.169 --> 06:17.090
I would never copy that.

06:17.371 --> 06:20.717
Is this particularly, do you think this is something that you noticed

06:21.001 --> 06:23.184
This book illustration?

06:24.926 --> 06:26.829
Would illustrators be doing this everywhere?

06:26.909 --> 06:28.051
It's done everywhere.

06:28.351 --> 06:32.797
If we go back in the kitchen, I'll show you the Jasper Johns song, hanging above the sink.

06:33.378 --> 06:42.491
Now Jasper Johns, the lithograph there is called The Ventriloquist, I think it is, and he's quoting my great whale from Moby Dick.

06:44.233 --> 06:44.593
Okay?

06:44.954 --> 06:49.460
If you look at Robert Rauschenberg's work, Rauschenberg does it in a much more direct way than I do.

06:49.500 --> 06:50.822
He actually takes the image

06:51.157 --> 07:02.652
He would take this, for instance, cut this out, and take this very printed image against the canvas, wash it through with typewash, which dissolves the ink right off onto the canvas.

07:02.672 --> 07:03.714
You can admittedly do this.

07:03.954 --> 07:04.415
Oh, of course.

07:04.595 --> 07:04.755
Yeah.

07:05.075 --> 07:06.357
Yeah.

07:06.477 --> 07:07.899
It's recorded.

07:07.959 --> 07:09.261
I mean, this is common.

07:10.022 --> 07:10.643
Common done.

07:10.663 --> 07:12.345
Commonly done.

07:12.365 --> 07:13.527
That's fascinating.

07:13.827 --> 07:16.491
And then a couple of quotes on... And you go into music.

07:16.951 --> 07:19.054
And appropriation in music is even...

07:19.405 --> 07:20.066
greater.

07:20.427 --> 07:25.675
I mean, I've been concentrating the last couple of months on listening to Handel oratorios.

07:26.195 --> 07:43.161
If you start listening to all of the oratorios, you know, Joseph and his brethren and Balthasar's feast and all that kind of stuff, and everybody knows Messiah, you can start hearing where Handel has lifted this piece and lifted this piece and lifted this piece, you know, and put it all together.

07:43.181 --> 07:46.847
And he wasn't about stealing from other... Listen, one of my best

07:47.097 --> 07:50.821
One of the best feature stories I ever wrote when I was a reporter was I went flying with the Blue Angels.

07:51.181 --> 07:51.701
Oh, you did?

07:51.822 --> 07:52.122
Yeah.

07:52.222 --> 07:53.103
I mean, in the airplane?

07:53.123 --> 07:53.563
In the airplane.

07:53.924 --> 07:55.105
And, you know, and they took me in.

07:55.445 --> 07:56.506
And I remember... How many times did you puke?

07:56.946 --> 07:59.129
No, I love this stuff.

07:59.149 --> 08:01.691
I have a pilot's license, which I haven't used in a long time.

08:01.711 --> 08:01.851
Do you?

08:01.891 --> 08:02.772
Guess what I'm interested in.

08:02.952 --> 08:03.673
There you go.

08:03.773 --> 08:05.655
I mean, I love to fly, and I love airplanes.

08:06.356 --> 08:13.122
But I remember I came back, and my lead for that story was, and it was a straight ripoff of Edward R. Moore, and yesterday the 3rd Air Force took me for a little ride.

08:13.321 --> 08:17.126
I said, yesterday the Blue Angels took me for a little while.

08:17.146 --> 08:17.686
Yeah, of course.

08:17.706 --> 08:19.288
We all knew that.

08:19.308 --> 08:19.529
Absolutely.

08:19.549 --> 08:20.430
It was one of the greats.

08:20.750 --> 08:21.992
Absolutely.

08:22.012 --> 08:24.615
But I know, whether it worked for him or why can't it work for me?

08:24.635 --> 08:25.036
Yeah, right.

08:25.056 --> 08:25.336
You know?

08:25.877 --> 08:27.639
What was it T.S.

08:27.659 --> 08:33.746
Eliot said, young writers plagiarize, old writers steal?

08:33.766 --> 08:34.387
That's right.

08:35.148 --> 08:38.773
What Charlotte said, history repeats itself, historians repeat one another.

08:40.575 --> 08:40.695
Right.

08:41.435 --> 08:44.799
Which is why when a mistake gets in the history books, it's there forever.

08:44.859 --> 08:49.865
It's almost the hardest thing in the world to correct an historical error.

08:50.025 --> 08:52.408
Because the historians keep lifting it and using it.

08:52.468 --> 08:56.453
Because they keep lifting it from each other.

08:56.473 --> 08:56.573
Yeah.

08:56.593 --> 08:57.514
And saying it back as if it's true.

08:59.076 --> 08:59.357
I have to pee.

08:59.377 --> 08:59.477
Okay.

08:59.497 --> 09:00.338
It's been a lot.

09:00.358 --> 09:03.361
And, you know, we can always... Oh, email's great.

09:03.381 --> 09:04.002
Email.

09:04.042 --> 09:04.543
We're close.

09:04.843 --> 09:10.790
Just briefly, I know I've got some quotes on it, but... I can't get back to this flying thing, though, here in a second.

09:11.011 --> 09:11.391
Okay.

09:11.793 --> 09:23.391
We've talked about illustrating new books and, you know, of course, that's a 19th century that's gone, people illustrating, especially new works of fiction.

09:23.591 --> 09:25.915
You have tried taking a hand of that.

09:26.115 --> 09:28.038
Maybe give me a quote on your thoughts on that.

09:28.659 --> 09:31.042
Well, that is part of my concern.

09:31.703 --> 09:38.053
Working with my contemporaries is the great joy of all.

09:38.827 --> 09:45.533
to be able to work with people who are, you know, using 20th century sensibilities the same way I am.

09:46.774 --> 09:53.921
Unfortunately, the economic structure of publishing doesn't allow for it very often, especially not mainstream publishing.

09:55.703 --> 10:02.109
Well, because, you know, I mean, unless you're Joyce Carol Oates... Which, and you've worked with her, actually.

10:02.129 --> 10:02.950
Yeah, a number of times.

10:02.970 --> 10:06.673
And, in fact, I illustrated a novel of hers just last year, or two years ago.

10:06.822 --> 10:08.744
time starts.

10:08.764 --> 10:11.107
I can't keep up with it.

10:11.127 --> 10:15.271
But, yeah, I did First Love, a little novel she published with Echo Press.

10:15.311 --> 10:18.094
Now, Joyce was perfectly willing to share royalties with me.

10:19.235 --> 10:21.818
Well, if you're prolific as she is, you can afford to do that.

10:21.878 --> 10:27.244
But if you're somebody who writes one novel every five years... And it's understandable, isn't it?

10:27.284 --> 10:27.564
Yeah.

10:27.645 --> 10:29.707
And they're going to share their royalty with me.

10:29.887 --> 10:32.750
Especially when the novel's probably going to be just as well with or without the pictures.

10:32.770 --> 10:32.990
Exactly.

10:33.351 --> 10:34.112
Exactly so.

10:34.372 --> 10:35.513
And the...

10:35.813 --> 10:41.059
the publisher is not going to increase the royalty schedule to 15% to give me a 5% royalty.

10:41.080 --> 10:42.682
That's not going to happen.

10:42.702 --> 10:49.290
So economics doesn't really work out, except in the private press world.

10:49.730 --> 10:57.680
And that's where I've had the privilege of working with people like Robert Olin Butler and Kay Gibbons and John Updike.

10:57.700 --> 10:58.942
That's nice.

10:59.102 --> 11:00.243
Yeah, it's very nice.

11:00.864 --> 11:02.386
And the perfect union is what?

11:02.506 --> 11:04.909
The illustrator brings...

11:05.024 --> 11:10.389
an added dimension to it, to make it a synergistic kind of a production?

11:11.070 --> 11:22.501
The ideal place is to do an image for a book that even the author recognizes is taking it where the author didn't take it.

11:22.521 --> 11:28.927
That's the great—that's the moment of triumph right there.

11:29.328 --> 11:31.530
Does anything spring to mind?

11:31.570 --> 11:34.913
Yeah, back from Joyce Carol Oates' First Love.

11:35.686 --> 11:42.593
She said, I did an image, it's a very strange little novel, and I did an image of a serpent crawling across the face of Christ.

11:42.914 --> 11:46.157
But the face of Christ is, I think, a Greek icon.

11:46.177 --> 11:54.326
You know, so you had this very carefully modeled, naturalistic looking snake crawling across this very flat icon.

11:56.027 --> 11:57.889
She wrote me a letter about that.

11:57.909 --> 12:01.373
She said, she remarked that it was very...

12:02.770 --> 12:05.213
arresting or strange or some language like that.

12:05.453 --> 12:08.457
And then she said, and of course, Barry, that's your image, not mine.

12:10.859 --> 12:16.246
So those are really, those are uplifting moments.

12:16.266 --> 12:19.389
But you don't get that with Mark Twain, you know.

12:20.130 --> 12:25.977
And Miss Welty's saying to me that I had made the Robert Bridegroom my book, you know.

12:26.480 --> 12:27.241
That sort of thing.

12:27.261 --> 12:28.202
That's kind of nice.

12:28.222 --> 12:29.805
Sweet things, you know.

12:29.825 --> 12:32.008
But that's really... That's the job of illustration.

12:32.028 --> 12:38.697
The job of illustration, if it's done well, is not to merely ape and mimic and repeat the text.

12:38.717 --> 12:47.448
It's to take the text another step to at least confront and provoke a reader into thinking that something else might be possible.

12:47.469 --> 12:49.291
Think about this, for instance, this way.

12:49.732 --> 12:54.478
And you really have to read that book and understand it and almost get into the creative...

12:54.914 --> 12:56.517
mode of the author, is that right?

12:56.577 --> 12:59.000
Do you talk about it with the author, or do you try not to?

12:59.020 --> 13:01.624
Yeah, but of course the ones that are alive and are willing to talk.

13:01.645 --> 13:03.527
Well, I mean the living ones, yeah, obviously.

13:03.547 --> 13:04.549
Yeah, we do, sometimes.

13:04.609 --> 13:10.679
And the dead ones can't bitch, either, if they don't like it.

13:10.939 --> 13:23.098
Well, that's one of the reasons why in children's books there really isn't much intercourse between writer and illustrator, is because the writer often will want to tell me too much.

13:23.433 --> 13:24.414
I have a story about that.

13:24.434 --> 13:25.535
It has to do with Ken Kesey.

13:26.316 --> 13:30.981
I did a book with him, a children's book called Little Trick is a Squirrel Meets Big Double the Bear.

13:31.442 --> 13:33.024
That's Big Double the Bear over there on the wall.

13:33.444 --> 13:41.012
And my editor at Viking said to me one day, he said, Ken wants to know if he can call you.

13:42.094 --> 13:42.954
And I said, sure.

13:43.575 --> 13:44.756
I'd love to talk to Ken Kesey.

13:44.817 --> 13:45.998
Who wouldn't?

13:46.078 --> 13:47.660
Because he wanted to tell you how to do the pictures.

13:47.680 --> 13:50.723
So I hung up and I'm sitting there thinking, Ken Kesey won't call me.

13:51.732 --> 13:56.396
And I called my editor back and I said, hey, why does Keesey want to call me?

13:56.516 --> 13:57.277
She said, I don't know.

13:57.297 --> 13:58.618
I said, okay, well, tell him you're calling me.

13:58.638 --> 13:59.719
But listen, tell him this too.

14:00.460 --> 14:03.803
If he's going to call me to tell me how to do my work, don't call.

14:04.804 --> 14:09.208
Or if he's going to call me and tell me how to do my work, he can call me and tell me how to do my work.

14:09.228 --> 14:18.617
But he's going to have to, next year, take 12 drawings from me and write a story about my 12 drawings, except I'm going to tell him how to write the story.

14:20.318 --> 14:23.082
And he never called me.

14:23.102 --> 14:24.964
That's perfect sense.

14:25.024 --> 14:26.886
But that's when it's an equal collaboration.

14:26.947 --> 14:27.207
Right.

14:27.607 --> 14:28.128
Exactly.

14:28.188 --> 14:34.496
There are times when people are writing for the artist, or the artist is illustrating for the author.

14:34.957 --> 14:35.077
Right.

14:35.097 --> 14:38.301
And so it's not an even relationship.

14:39.042 --> 14:41.365
And so then maybe there can be a disparity.

14:41.465 --> 14:41.986
Exactly.

14:42.126 --> 14:47.213
And the best kinds of collaborations are the ones that begin when neither person's done any work.

14:47.373 --> 14:47.473
Yeah.

14:47.656 --> 14:48.817
And this is funny.

14:48.838 --> 14:50.880
So you're working the end product at the same time?

14:50.900 --> 14:52.622
You see, what you tell me now makes perfect sense.

14:52.642 --> 14:56.928
I remember talking to Anita Silvey at Hovement for asking about the process.

14:58.530 --> 15:04.097
When you're considering children's books, do you expect the author to come in with the art?

15:04.117 --> 15:07.842
And she says, no, in fact, we prefer that you don't even know the artist.

15:07.990 --> 15:08.370
Yeah.

15:08.390 --> 15:10.593
We like to marry the two together.

15:10.813 --> 15:11.114
That's right.

15:11.134 --> 15:12.195
And I think that's what you're telling me.

15:12.235 --> 15:12.715
That's the reason.

15:12.735 --> 15:17.040
People write me all the time and send me manuscripts and stuff, you know, and I always say, hey, listen, this isn't the way we do this.

15:17.060 --> 15:17.821
No, that's right.

15:17.901 --> 15:19.203
It makes perfect sense, doesn't it?

15:19.263 --> 15:21.926
The bailiwick of the editor is marrying these two.

15:21.946 --> 15:25.630
And that's where the editor comes in and says, this person will be perfect for this manuscript.

15:25.750 --> 15:26.411
That's right.

15:26.771 --> 15:28.233
And we don't even want them to talk.

15:29.054 --> 15:32.698
As little as possible, if you happen to be a good friend.

15:32.678 --> 15:39.226
When I did Beauty and the Beast with Nancy Willard, Nancy had not written the story, and I hadn't done any illustrations.

15:39.266 --> 15:43.651
And we were both commissioned at the same time by Harcourt to do this book.

15:44.813 --> 15:48.377
We went, we drove, I drove over to... She lives out here, yeah.

15:48.437 --> 15:51.100
Yeah, she lived in, and she lives in Poughkeepsie, teaches at Vassar.

15:51.341 --> 15:54.184
And so I went over and met her and her husband.

15:54.825 --> 15:56.447
Were you with me, or was it Rami?

15:57.668 --> 15:58.990
I don't know, I've done a couple times.

15:59.611 --> 16:10.693
Well, we went to this place outside of Rheinbeck, and it was this really ramshackle, old, wonderful Victorian mansion.

16:10.713 --> 16:18.008
It was run by Miss Sukley, Miss Daisy Sukley, who, when she died, under her bed they found

16:18.342 --> 16:22.188
a box full of love letters to her from Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

16:22.288 --> 16:22.849
Oh, sure.

16:22.869 --> 16:23.811
You remember this?

16:23.931 --> 16:24.412
Yes, I do.

16:24.432 --> 16:25.674
Okay, Miss Daisy Suitley.

16:26.154 --> 16:31.302
And she took me and Nancy Willard all around this house, because that's where she lived.

16:31.363 --> 16:35.048
She raised Scotty's, which was one of which belonged to the land.

16:35.850 --> 16:45.325
And as we walked around, I was taking photographs of things in this house, and Nancy and I were telling the story back and forth of Beauty and the Beast, back and forth to each other.

16:45.465 --> 16:46.206
Oh, she said, you know,

16:47.283 --> 16:51.030
This would be a perfect place where beauty plays chess with the beast.

16:52.813 --> 16:57.582
And she's making up her own story, but setting it because of the sun.

16:57.883 --> 16:59.125
We walked up onto the roof.

16:59.385 --> 17:01.189
That's a crazy story.

17:01.209 --> 17:02.431
And we're telling the story back then.

17:02.571 --> 17:08.903
I then got home and developed all my photographs, sent her a set of them, and then she wrote the story.

17:09.862 --> 17:13.768
So in this case, the images sort of precipitated the prose.

17:13.888 --> 17:15.010
That's great.

17:15.070 --> 17:15.630
I love that.

17:15.650 --> 17:17.273
And that's a perfect kind of collaboration.

17:17.293 --> 17:17.894
I love that picture.

17:17.934 --> 17:22.340
Willie Morris and I did the same sort of thing in this little book on Little League.

17:22.641 --> 17:27.668
I had done my sketches and everything for the book, but it didn't quite work out to 32 pages.

17:28.649 --> 17:33.857
I needed two more spreads in order for the prose to break the way I wanted it to break.

17:34.438 --> 17:39.345
So I called Willie and I said, hey, Willie, we've got to have two more scenes here.

17:39.511 --> 17:41.153
And he said, we got any ideas?

17:42.816 --> 17:43.417
And I said, yeah.

17:43.437 --> 17:44.218
I said, how about you?

17:44.238 --> 17:46.742
He said, well, yeah, I think I'll do something with the grandparents.

17:46.882 --> 17:50.828
Okay, I'll do one about, you know, bless the grandparents and all these kinds of stuff.

17:50.848 --> 17:51.609
And he said, how about you?

17:51.669 --> 17:56.656
And I said, well, Willie, I tried to play ball when I was a kid, but I could never hit the ball.

17:57.277 --> 17:58.980
I had a zero batting average.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.202
He laughed his ass off.

18:00.222 --> 18:03.506
And he told that story one more time.

18:03.526 --> 18:09.315
And so I said, what I'd like to do is see a thing in there for a little kid who always strikes out.

18:09.987 --> 18:12.230
So he added that for me, you know?

18:12.871 --> 18:15.454
So those are the kinds of collaborations that are really nice.

18:15.594 --> 18:25.647
But when one person comes in to the other and starts demanding certain things or double-guessing, you know, that can get ugly.

18:25.667 --> 18:26.708
That's not going to work.

18:26.728 --> 18:27.550
That's a great picture.

18:27.610 --> 18:27.810
Isn't it?

18:28.351 --> 18:29.832
I'll have Kara print one for you.

18:29.873 --> 18:30.974
Does she do her own darkroom?

18:31.014 --> 18:31.895
Really?

18:33.277 --> 18:33.617
Hey, Kara!

18:35.179 --> 18:35.440
That's okay.

18:35.460 --> 18:36.501
I love the dog.

18:37.325 --> 18:42.614
You, uh, you can ask me a question about where you're going to bring up.

18:42.694 --> 18:46.100
I'm a 747, out a window.

18:46.400 --> 18:46.821
No, what is?

18:46.961 --> 18:48.043
I'm sorry, what's the background?

18:48.284 --> 18:48.784
The background.

18:48.804 --> 18:49.225
Okay.

18:49.265 --> 18:50.628
Yeah, it's a stick with camera.

18:50.968 --> 18:52.531
And the name of this?

18:52.551 --> 18:53.192
The destroyer.

18:53.633 --> 18:54.534
The destroyer.

18:55.275 --> 18:58.000
And then you put her on top of a globe that you must have got.

18:58.541 --> 19:03.349
Yeah, sort of the orb, which comes from Albert Durer.

19:03.751 --> 19:07.215
Which is exactly the same board that wisdom is sitting on.

19:07.235 --> 19:12.000
That looks just like a stainless steel salad bowl.

19:12.020 --> 19:12.600
Exactly what it is.

19:14.162 --> 19:17.285
But you see, that gives me the top of the globe and it gives me the reflections.

19:19.868 --> 19:20.869
Rather than making them up.

19:21.409 --> 19:26.014
And then for Biblio, they would love a couple of self-portraits of yourself.

19:26.775 --> 19:28.116
From the Bible or other sources.

19:28.176 --> 19:32.661
I think I would like other sources because I also plan to talk about your...

19:34.733 --> 19:35.556
Okay, come on now.

19:35.617 --> 19:44.794
Come on, I'm looking at this to me.
