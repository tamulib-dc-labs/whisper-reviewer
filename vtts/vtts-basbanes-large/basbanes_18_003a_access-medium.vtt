00:02.562 --> 00:06.102
Jennifer Egan, congratulations on your new book.

00:06.705 --> 00:09.822
Tell me, it's kind of a gutsy thing to...

00:10.240 --> 00:14.305
and a new collection of stories to have the first story narrated by a man.

00:14.385 --> 00:18.310
I mean, did you feel at all intimidated by this?

00:18.410 --> 00:29.204
Obviously, you know, doing these different voices doesn't seem to... I didn't feel intimidated in writing it because I assumed that I would do it very badly and no one would believe me.

00:29.224 --> 00:35.452
And I just sort of gave myself the freedom to think, I'll never show this to anyone or publish it.

00:35.492 --> 00:36.653
It'll just be for fun.

00:37.004 --> 00:42.774
And I have found, actually, that that is the best precursor to success.

00:42.874 --> 00:48.004
I mean, when you give yourself that freedom, it's amazing, you know, what can happen.

00:48.064 --> 00:54.996
And so I just sort of let myself go, and I wrote the story, and I had so much fun doing it.

00:55.465 --> 01:00.531
It turned out that it really, I felt as I was working on it, that it was really working.

01:00.591 --> 01:08.021
Although I didn't, obviously until I ran this voice past other people, I had no sense of whether anyone would believe it was a man.

01:09.522 --> 01:16.431
But ultimately, I mean, my feeling really is, and this may just be that it's the last story that I wrote, I feel that it's the best.

01:16.792 --> 01:17.452
Was it the last?

01:17.853 --> 01:19.194
It was the last one that I wrote, yeah.

01:19.215 --> 01:21.237
And then you led the collection with it.

01:21.217 --> 01:22.060
Exactly.

01:22.100 --> 01:26.776
Because I felt, I mean, in a way, you know, there's so many theories as to how to organize a collection.

01:26.876 --> 01:31.632
I just feel like throw your best effort down there so people can say...

01:32.050 --> 01:34.895
you know, this is or is not something that interests me.

01:35.897 --> 01:37.379
Some people don't agree that it's the best.

01:37.399 --> 01:38.361
I agree wholeheartedly.

01:38.521 --> 01:40.445
And I'm sorry, they don't agree what?

01:40.625 --> 01:46.195
Some people don't like that the best because there is, I mean, there are a lot of stories in there that are much more emotional.

01:46.595 --> 01:56.252
I'd say that there is, I mean, there are a lot of ways to divide it, but certainly there are the stories that are about sort of young adolescent girls and tend to be much more emotional.

01:56.806 --> 02:02.615
Emotional, and I think in some ways more from the heart, although I think why China is very much from the heart, too.

02:03.216 --> 02:12.871
And some people prefer those, but I just feel that technically and just in terms of ambition... Ambition for yourself.

02:12.991 --> 02:15.174
Yeah, that why China is the strongest.

02:15.214 --> 02:19.161
So my feeling was, you know, absolutely I have to open with that.

02:19.741 --> 02:24.028
And it is a little nerve-wracking because you just wonder, you know, some people I think...

02:24.008 --> 02:34.389
will find it difficult to start a story in the first person, you know, by an author that they obviously can see as female from her byline.

02:34.710 --> 02:38.758
Well, I mean, you have to, and you do throw very early on, you know, beardless.

02:39.199 --> 02:43.468
I mean, because until the word beardless is used...

02:43.448 --> 02:44.730
We're thinking it's a woman.

02:44.750 --> 02:46.233
It could be, you know, the gender.

02:46.614 --> 02:49.719
Well, I mean, the assumption, of course, is that it's a woman.

02:49.739 --> 02:51.162
They say, well, I have beardless.

02:51.182 --> 02:52.785
This is a guy talking here.

02:53.086 --> 02:54.087
I know.

02:54.107 --> 03:02.723
I read the story at Barnes & Noble here in New York the other night, and I was very curious to see how that would go because I thought it's one thing to ask for that suspension of disbelief when people can't.

03:02.703 --> 03:18.602
see you that's like a guy singing the man I love I know but you know what people seem to really like it I mean they seemed quite wrapped I didn't feel that I mean the story is sort of funny and toward the end you definitely get some laughs but I didn't think they were it didn't seem that they were laughing because I was the one reading it

03:19.223 --> 03:31.033
Well, then congratulations to you because, you know, that's the thing, to get the reader or the audience to just, you know, get past the reader, I guess, and into the story.

03:31.334 --> 03:32.415
Yeah, I think so too.

03:33.135 --> 03:35.698
When you said ambition, is that another way of saying challenge?

03:35.738 --> 03:37.779
Was it a challenge for you or did you feel?

03:38.120 --> 03:39.581
I did feel that it was a challenge.

03:39.641 --> 03:48.589
I mean, one thing about that story that I liked as I was working on it and still like is that I'm really not sure exactly what it's about, in quotes.

03:48.569 --> 03:53.557
I just, it has a slightly mysterious element to me even now.

03:53.597 --> 04:04.435
And I think that I used to, I used to feel that it was just important to set your goals very high and achieve them in terms of not only having an emotional arc to the story, but really, you know...

04:04.617 --> 04:10.690
some thematic content that seemed to warrant all of this time and effort, really and truly something to say.

04:10.730 --> 04:21.975
But now I've come to feel more that you want to feel that, yes, but you don't want it to be something that you can reduce to a theory or an opinion or something like that.

04:22.035 --> 04:23.959
And so I find that...

04:23.939 --> 04:28.143
having a certain opaqueness in the end, even to myself.

04:28.583 --> 04:29.844
Opaqueness or opacity?

04:30.205 --> 04:30.985
Opacity.

04:32.687 --> 04:35.690
I want to check it out myself.

04:38.052 --> 04:39.033
I like that.

04:39.073 --> 04:43.377
I mean, I feel that it shouldn't be easy to exhaust a story.

04:43.417 --> 04:53.406
And for me also, that one came very easily, which I think is always nice because it just means that you don't have to work it and labor it so hard.

04:53.723 --> 04:55.968
to make it work.

04:56.489 --> 05:09.339
And I think it sometimes can retain a little bit of resilience and freshness that sometimes stories that you work the hardest on and even care the most about just don't have in the end because they have been worked too much.

05:09.880 --> 05:11.985
I love the analogy of pie dough.

05:12.185 --> 05:17.111
You know, when you roll out pie dough, you cannot do it too many times, or it just loses something.

05:17.131 --> 05:20.875
You really have to sort of get it right, throw it in the pan, and go for it.

05:21.115 --> 05:26.982
And if you have to keep re-rolling it and starting over and all that, it's just not as good.

05:27.002 --> 05:36.032
So I think that's another reason I feel very fondly toward white china, because in a funny way, it was one that came easily and was fun.

05:36.012 --> 05:45.253
And I think part of the reason that it was is that it's about someone who's not like me at all, you know, starting with his gender and moving on from there.

05:45.313 --> 05:48.461
And that was just very freeing and thrilling.

05:48.541 --> 05:50.505
I think I want to move in that direction.

05:50.565 --> 05:52.570
Did you see...

05:53.292 --> 06:03.241
When you were writing the stories, I mean, were these written because they've been published, many of them, I guess, or all of them in magazines?

06:03.901 --> 06:06.604
Were you doing individual stories or were you working?

06:06.844 --> 06:10.688
Was there an idea that this would be a cohesive collection?

06:10.988 --> 06:15.412
And in your mind, did you have a theme that you thought was connecting them?

06:16.533 --> 06:18.354
I think that I did not.

06:18.374 --> 06:20.636
I was not thinking of it as a cohesive collection.

06:20.676 --> 06:21.257
I was...

06:21.659 --> 06:25.706
I was really, for some of those stories, I was really just trying to learn how to write.

06:25.726 --> 06:34.742
I had been working on my novel for a long time, and it was a very arduous and sort of frustrating process.

06:36.204 --> 06:40.191
And basically what happened was after college I went to England for a couple of years.

06:40.231 --> 06:44.258
I had a scholarship, and I wrote this incredibly long and really...

06:44.238 --> 06:48.806
dismal draft of my novel, which was virtually unreadable.

06:48.846 --> 06:52.051
Well, was it this novel, The Invisible Circus?

06:52.071 --> 06:57.640
It was The Invisible Circus, but it was called Inland Souls, and it was just a monster.

06:57.700 --> 06:59.423
I mean, it was terrible.

06:59.563 --> 07:02.989
It's actually sort of funny, but not intentionally.

07:02.969 --> 07:08.999
And so I came back with this thing thinking, well, now I'll sell this and, you know, I'll be a fabulous star.

07:09.079 --> 07:13.667
And it was, you know, that was the middle of the 80s when there really were these sort of young literary stars.

07:13.747 --> 07:17.875
It was McInerney and Bredesen Ellis and all these people.

07:17.895 --> 07:19.898
And I thought, well, I'm going to join their ranks.

07:20.418 --> 07:23.046
And, you know, of course it didn't work out that way at all.

07:23.106 --> 07:26.536
I mean, the friends I gave it to started to avoid my phone calls.

07:26.636 --> 07:35.001
And the agents I sent it to, you know, whipped it right back to me so fast it seemed I had barely put it in the mailbox and I was taking it back out.

07:35.251 --> 07:39.358
And so at that point I realized that something was terribly wrong.

07:39.398 --> 07:41.020
I mean, I didn't know what I was doing.

07:41.060 --> 07:51.718
And so I began writing stories as a way to just work on a smaller scale and try to understand how to make people feel things and react to what I was writing.

07:51.818 --> 07:55.023
I mean, I had lost that connection to my reader totally.

07:55.143 --> 07:58.609
Did you publish stories prior to publishing the novel?

07:58.825 --> 07:59.666
Yes.

07:59.746 --> 08:09.359
In the end, because I wrote a lot of these stories while I was working on the novel, they were ready to be published much before it was.

08:09.859 --> 08:17.329
And most of them, except for Why China, they all were published before the novel came out.

08:17.389 --> 08:18.070
Oh, really?

08:18.130 --> 08:18.731
Yeah.

08:18.751 --> 08:21.174
So you really did do your apprenticeship with the stories?

08:21.214 --> 08:22.015
Very much so.

08:22.276 --> 08:24.038
Very much so.

08:24.238 --> 08:25.660
And I should have checked...

08:26.264 --> 08:26.965
My fault.

08:26.985 --> 08:30.048
I should have checked the copyright page to see when these appear.

08:30.128 --> 08:30.889
Oh, don't worry.

08:30.909 --> 08:45.604
Well, they really encompass a lot of years, which is something that, I mean, in some ways it concerns me because I think, you know, there seems to be this sense that collections should be seamless and sort of of a moment in some way.

08:45.664 --> 08:46.725
This is really not.

08:46.786 --> 08:49.388
I mean, this is sort of the best of what I wrote.

08:49.448 --> 08:51.090
I publish stories that aren't in there.

08:51.577 --> 08:55.743
I took out the ones that I didn't think could really hold up.

08:57.024 --> 09:04.855
But this is really sort of a compilation of various things that I was doing and thinking about over the course of really eight or nine years.

09:04.895 --> 09:14.968
I did completely overhaul all of them before the book was published because some of them... I mean, there are stories in there that I feel...

09:15.252 --> 09:44.955
strongly about and really like like for example one piece um which is about the the girl and her brother the brother who has been responsible for the mother's death and um this this girl feels that she can somehow save him from that guilt and she goes she takes sort of drastic action and i really feel that the story is very heartfelt in a way that almost might be hard for me to do now but it's very primitive in terms of the writing i mean it's just there's not a lot of um

09:45.627 --> 09:48.691
There's not a lot of style yet to the prose.

09:49.573 --> 09:52.257
But, you know, from my point of view, that's okay.

09:52.277 --> 09:53.999
I mean, I feel like there's a real range.

09:54.039 --> 10:01.310
Then you have White China, which is, you know, I think is much more on top of my game by the time I wrote that.

10:02.892 --> 10:10.403
However, I will say that I do think a common set of interests informs a lot of the stories and my novel because, you know,

10:10.855 --> 10:22.951
by virtue of the fact that to some degree I was working through, you know, questions of technique and all of that, using the stories in order to bring all of that back to the novel.

10:23.592 --> 10:34.146
And I think that what, I mean, just to sort of, you know, hopefully not reduce the whole thing to a giant cliché, I think that what that set of concerns involves is, you know...

10:34.328 --> 10:46.367
on some level, the search for transcendence, the desire to be lifted above everyday life, and what sorts of lengths that urge can drive people to.

10:46.728 --> 10:49.272
Do you think you're speaking for your generation at all?

10:49.292 --> 10:53.038
I mean, are you expressing... I think perhaps I am to some degree.

10:53.058 --> 10:56.003
I mean, that's such a... I mean, like Ann Beatty, of course.

10:56.023 --> 11:01.872
I mean, well, I know, but Ann Beatty has been always... It's almost an accusation now, and she detests it, you know, that...

11:01.852 --> 11:08.539
Well, to a degree, you know, that she writes for her generation and she's the voice of blah, blah, blah.

11:09.220 --> 11:16.829
But I'm wondering, you know, because of many of the concerns that you do write about seem to be endemic to young people, people of your age.

11:16.849 --> 11:20.533
Well, I think that, I mean, you know, it's funny because what is a generation?

11:20.593 --> 11:26.880
I think that I'm in a very funny generation because I'm the first generation in

11:27.670 --> 11:29.093
After the baby boomers.

11:29.694 --> 11:40.414
Not to have experienced the 60s firsthand, but not to have been part of the kind of technological boom that leads you to have grown up with computers and all that.

11:40.575 --> 11:44.001
I fall right in between, which is sort of interesting.

11:44.061 --> 11:49.071
It's amazing, isn't it?

11:49.557 --> 11:51.120
And she's teaching me how to work.

11:52.221 --> 11:52.983
Oh, yeah.

11:53.023 --> 11:55.547
It's like they're born with this ability.

11:55.567 --> 11:59.193
It's a totally different, yeah.

11:59.213 --> 12:05.563
And so I feel, it's funny because I feel sort of in some ways, you know, that my generation is almost an anomaly.

12:05.624 --> 12:07.607
I mean, how can I call that a generation?

12:07.647 --> 12:10.131
It's a matter of a few years because my brother, who's...

12:10.111 --> 12:15.161
six and a half years younger, falls soundly into the kind of 20-something.

12:15.262 --> 12:16.845
I mean, he's in cyberspace.

12:16.885 --> 12:17.867
He works in computers.

12:17.887 --> 12:19.691
He does 3D animation.

12:19.991 --> 12:21.695
And I feel... Does he read books?

12:22.737 --> 12:23.318
He does.

12:23.379 --> 12:24.962
It took him a while to get there.

12:25.002 --> 12:28.930
Oddly enough, he seems to read more the more he gets involved in this...

12:28.910 --> 12:31.816
in this kind of hijinx computer stuff.

12:31.836 --> 12:35.022
Yeah, but you think he'll, now this is from, this is from my own, my next book.

12:35.042 --> 12:40.273
I'm just curious because I do hope to go into the next century and just see where it's going.

12:40.293 --> 12:41.215
Do you think he'll read?

12:41.684 --> 12:43.847
He'll happily go to books and computers?

12:44.328 --> 12:46.231
Or do you think he'll still want a printed book?

12:46.432 --> 12:50.578
Well, he seems to buy books and read them, you know?

12:50.618 --> 12:55.046
I mean, I have to say, I am very skeptical about this books on computer thing.

12:55.106 --> 12:57.089
I mean, no one likes to look at a screen.

12:57.429 --> 13:00.454
There's something about a book that has to do with its objecthood.

13:00.935 --> 13:02.157
And I think...

13:02.137 --> 13:09.186
You know, people have been very quick to say that that's all going to end, really, ever since movies began.

13:09.486 --> 13:10.688
Yeah, that's true.

13:10.708 --> 13:11.609
Television, really.

13:11.629 --> 13:14.392
When everybody got a television, nobody was going to read anymore.

13:14.412 --> 13:14.933
Exactly.

13:14.953 --> 13:22.462
Well, it just, you know, it seems like the little dogged, low-tech book, it seems to have something to offer that nothing else can.

13:22.522 --> 13:28.870
And I think what that is, to some degree, is an experience that takes place over a long period of time.

13:28.850 --> 13:38.425
which is not the case with movies, not the case with television, and not the case with the whole sensibility of being on a computer, which is much more instantaneous and momentary.

13:38.765 --> 13:41.189
Well, can you take a computer to bed with you?

13:41.409 --> 13:42.431
Exactly.

13:42.551 --> 13:43.473
I don't even write on it.

13:43.493 --> 13:45.636
You don't write on a computer?

13:45.896 --> 13:50.463
I use it as a typing machine, but I do not write on one, no.

13:50.824 --> 13:51.465
Pencil?

13:51.445 --> 13:51.966
Pen.

13:52.026 --> 13:52.366
Pen.

13:52.967 --> 14:00.816
Terrible, scrabbly writing that sometimes I can't even read, but often I substitute, I think, better things than what I had written in the first place when I can't read it.

14:01.016 --> 14:03.399
When you turn in manuscripts, they're typed, of course.

14:03.419 --> 14:03.899
Oh, yeah, yeah.

14:04.019 --> 14:09.205
Because the thing is, I do multiple drafts, so the advent of the computer helped me a lot.

14:09.225 --> 14:12.149
I mean, I got my first computer in, I think, my senior year of college.

14:12.549 --> 14:17.695
And, you know, I would have to, up until then, I was retyping several times 40-page papers.

14:17.715 --> 14:18.516
Oh, I know what that is.

14:18.496 --> 14:21.699
I mean, how did I do it?

14:21.719 --> 14:23.802
And I'm kind of a perfectionist.

14:23.822 --> 14:25.503
I hate blemishes on a page.

14:25.523 --> 14:27.045
Oh, I can't stand it.

14:27.105 --> 14:29.748
It has to be really a perfect page.

14:29.768 --> 14:30.128
I know.

14:30.449 --> 14:35.854
And you'd be all the way down towards the bottom and you'd throw the damn thing away.

14:35.914 --> 14:37.997
And now with the computer, of course, it's wonderful.

14:38.057 --> 14:39.478
You just fix that little thing.

14:39.779 --> 14:40.239
I know.

14:40.299 --> 14:41.440
It's great.

14:41.460 --> 14:42.722
It's nice.

14:42.762 --> 14:47.507
I'm sorry to have gotten off track on the question there, but we were talking about... The generation.

14:47.627 --> 14:47.727
Yeah.

14:47.707 --> 14:58.960
So the answer is I think that my generation is a little bit of a funny wedge between the sort of 60s people and the cyber kids.

15:00.181 --> 15:10.373
However, I do feel that in terms of my interest in sort of the longing for transcendence and the form that that takes in image culture, which if I had to –

15:10.572 --> 15:27.585
boil down, you know, to its bare essentials, the big question on my mind maybe for the last eight or nine years, I do think that as so many of the sort of the religious and community structures have broken down, that this sort of

15:28.105 --> 15:39.156
this longing that I think is, to an extent, just innate and human, has fewer places to go and takes sort of stranger forms.

15:39.776 --> 15:44.521
And I do think that that... I see that all around me, even in the cyber kids.

15:45.281 --> 15:53.009
And so in that way, I think that I'm interested in something that a lot of people seem to feel, although they might express it in different ways.

15:54.771 --> 15:57.353
So, you know, it's...

15:57.738 --> 16:02.166
I guess to some degree I have found that people seem to be very responsive.

16:02.226 --> 16:18.075
I mean, for example, another story that people have really responded to more than I expected was Sisters of the Moon, which is the last one in there, about young kids, you know, basically young kids in the 70s taking drugs and hanging around with derelict Vietnam vets.

16:18.376 --> 16:30.732
And what I was really interested in, I mean, that story is actually quite autobiographical, not in terms of the actual plot, but the scene, the setting, you know, was something I really did experience quite young.

16:31.285 --> 16:34.914
What interested me about that was just sort of capturing that moment.

16:35.034 --> 16:42.191
I mean, there was just something particular about that time, and it's the sense of what had just passed and the sense of what might lie ahead.

16:42.212 --> 16:49.429
And a lot of people seem to just completely respond to that, and even people much younger than myself.

16:49.409 --> 16:57.600
So I think it was, I mean, in that, there was something generational going on there that I think I wasn't even fully aware of as I wrote it.

16:57.620 --> 17:05.091
There is a sense of dislocation, of course, in a lot of the stories, and maybe you could address yourself to that.

17:05.732 --> 17:08.416
Dislocation in the sense of sort of where am I and how am I?

17:08.436 --> 17:08.916
Yeah, really.

17:09.036 --> 17:13.763
I mean, Americans are broad, and you have these characters who do seem to be,

17:14.350 --> 17:18.735
apart, you know, from their environment?

17:18.976 --> 17:28.307
Well, I think one reason those sorts of scenarios come naturally to me has to do with my own background, which has been full of dislocation.

17:28.327 --> 17:30.951
You are a rather itinerant person, I could say.

17:31.311 --> 17:36.137
Yeah, and also, I mean, before I even had a choice, I mean, my mother and father divorced before I can remember.

17:36.377 --> 17:43.446
You know, we moved from the Midwest, where my whole family is from, to San Francisco, of all places, you know, in 1969.

17:43.426 --> 17:46.011
And then my mother and my stepfather ended up getting divorced.

17:46.031 --> 17:51.841
So I don't have any full siblings, and my background is quite disjointed and fractured.

17:51.881 --> 17:59.034
And as soon as I could get out of the house, I mean, at 18, I was at that door like a shot and determined to see the world.

17:59.195 --> 18:00.657
I mean, that was all I could think about.

18:00.697 --> 18:01.880
You left San Francisco?

18:02.040 --> 18:03.763
Yeah, I left San Francisco, and I...

18:04.452 --> 18:09.502
I did various things to earn money, and then I got a backpack and wandered through Europe.

18:10.584 --> 18:17.317
In fact, my itinerary became Phoebe's itinerary in my novel.

18:17.898 --> 18:23.169
But there's certainly a biographical reason for some of that dislocation.

18:23.289 --> 18:25.954
However, one thing that interests me about it...

18:26.137 --> 18:27.301
About setting people.

18:27.341 --> 18:28.845
I'm just ignoring my call waiting.

18:28.865 --> 18:30.631
I'm sure people think my phone... I was scared.

18:30.651 --> 18:32.516
I thought, well, all of a sudden we lost the connection.

18:32.777 --> 18:33.981
I'm just going to ignore it.

18:34.001 --> 18:34.542
It's been ringing.

18:34.582 --> 18:35.906
It's actually gone quite a few times.

18:35.947 --> 18:36.829
Do you want to grab it?

18:37.311 --> 18:38.193
Hold on just one second.

18:38.213 --> 18:39.537
It might be the same person.

18:39.658 --> 18:39.758
Okay.

18:45.492 --> 18:47.576
Were they there or gone?

18:48.077 --> 18:48.538
They're gone.

18:48.678 --> 18:49.660
I told them to go away.

18:49.900 --> 18:51.363
It could be Allison, but I doubt it.

18:51.523 --> 18:53.046
No, she knows better than that.

18:53.126 --> 18:54.689
She knows I wouldn't be picking up.

18:55.691 --> 19:07.753
However, the thing that interests me about people abroad or people temporarily knocked outside the structures of their so-called normal lives is that

19:08.189 --> 19:11.652
that creates the possibility for strange things to happen.

19:11.692 --> 19:26.467
I find it a highly dramatic situation because, you know, people in the course of normal life are often almost unaware of the various possibilities that exist around them because we're very much creatures of habit.

19:26.767 --> 19:33.454
And yet I think there's a part of us that absolutely rebels against those habits and wants badly to be freed from them.

19:33.434 --> 19:37.442
And that gets back to the question of longing, longing for other lives.

19:37.562 --> 19:41.290
I mean, we have these crazy imaginations that have nothing to do with life.

19:42.051 --> 19:50.869
And what I find so interesting is putting people in situations in which they're outside their normal lives and therefore much more...

19:51.305 --> 19:57.997
however you want to put it, at the mercy of or beguiled by their imaginations and seeing what happens.

19:58.137 --> 20:02.846
Where do their imaginations take them and what are the concrete results in terms of their lives?

20:04.208 --> 20:09.718
I'm interested in those moments when people suddenly decide to lie, for example.

20:10.137 --> 20:15.467
Or to pretend to be someone else, to literally try to be someone else.

20:16.288 --> 20:23.923
And then I'm also interested in the funny way that normal, you know, again, so-called normal life has of reclaiming us finally.

20:24.043 --> 20:31.116
That, you know, for all of the sense of infinite possibility one can sometimes feel, it's amazing how...

20:31.298 --> 20:37.045
how quickly that, you know, you sort of wake up the next morning and you're still you and you still have your life.

20:38.067 --> 20:51.905
So all of those things interest me a lot, and I've found dramatically that one of the more fruitful ways to explore them for me has been to set people in foreign locales, in addition to the sheer pleasure of writing about foreign places, which I love.

20:52.465 --> 20:56.831
What is this interest in fashion models and photographers?

20:56.851 --> 21:00.816
Is this just kind of a metaphor for you, or is this, again, something that you know or...

21:00.796 --> 21:10.469
One of the various things I did right after I got out of high school, before I went to college, was model for a period not that long.

21:11.230 --> 21:17.798
It came about through desperation because I was determined to be an archaeologist at that point.

21:18.279 --> 21:21.283
Which I want to talk about when you finish this book.

21:21.303 --> 21:21.403
Okay.

21:21.383 --> 21:22.845
About archaeology?

21:23.606 --> 21:23.847
Yeah.

21:24.407 --> 21:29.775
Just because when I was a kid, somebody asked me, what did you want to be most when you were a kid?

21:29.795 --> 21:31.157
I would say an archaeologist.

21:31.318 --> 21:31.838
It's so funny.

21:31.899 --> 21:34.142
It's not something that most kids think about.

21:34.182 --> 21:34.663
Oh, I love it.

21:34.943 --> 21:35.544
Me too.

21:35.724 --> 21:38.188
I still wonder if I should have been an archaeologist.

21:38.208 --> 21:41.633
I even consider writing in many ways almost an unlayering.

21:41.773 --> 21:42.634
I agree.

21:43.115 --> 21:44.036
That's what's so interesting.

21:44.056 --> 21:46.480
And getting to the core, you know, and then it's there.

21:46.460 --> 21:55.831
Absolutely, and it's so much the same thing because you're using, you're sort of moving inductively from the little artifacts of people's lives into the big picture.

21:55.851 --> 22:06.003
In fact, my book, to just jump big, is just a shameless, I mean, I modeled it on God's Graves and Scholars, you know, the Saram book, C.W.

22:06.043 --> 22:06.564
Saram book.

22:06.584 --> 22:07.165
Oh, really?

22:07.265 --> 22:13.612
From the 50s, which brought a vertu for arcane subject, which was the passion for archaeology.

22:13.933 --> 22:14.053
Right.

22:14.033 --> 22:16.917
You know, it went through about 50 printings, you know.

22:17.017 --> 22:18.899
It was a worldwide sensation.

22:19.100 --> 22:25.909
And I loved it because he wrote about this human passion, this passion for the past.

22:25.949 --> 22:31.536
And talk about a discipline that has its kind of wacky amateurs.

22:31.556 --> 22:32.017
Exactly.

22:32.577 --> 22:34.480
I can see how there's a real parallel there.

22:34.500 --> 22:37.524
Well, you know, I have a chapter in my book called Obsessed Amateurs, you know.

22:37.604 --> 22:38.745
Exactly.

22:39.266 --> 22:41.088
So really, that was the model for my book.

22:41.469 --> 22:43.872
So when I saw that you, I did see that you had a,

22:44.155 --> 22:45.857
an interest in archaeology.

22:46.197 --> 22:49.420
I said, well, that doesn't sound crazy to me.

22:49.580 --> 22:50.281
I love that.

22:50.301 --> 22:58.088
Well, it's funny because, of course, I was slightly overestimating the skills I had to offer at the age of, you know, 17 and a half.

22:58.168 --> 23:00.430
Yeah, but you wanted to dig, though, of some sort, I gather.

23:00.450 --> 23:01.431
Well, I finally had to.

23:01.631 --> 23:14.162
I had this idea that if I wrote to archaeologists around the country asking, you know, offering my services, they would fly me to places like Egypt and Greece, and I would get to dig for money.

23:14.142 --> 23:17.587
So it was actually really sort of absurd.

23:17.607 --> 23:22.614
I mean, I wrote these letters, and I think only one even answered, and they said, you know, you've got to be nuts.

23:22.734 --> 23:27.520
I mean, graduate students pay us to go on these pigs, and there's no way.

23:27.781 --> 23:40.538
So I was horrified because I had really no other plan for this year off, and although I knew I wanted to travel, I had a very low-paying, you know, job in an ice cream store, and it was going to take me all year just to save up the money.

23:41.024 --> 23:42.648
So I thought, oh, my God.

23:42.788 --> 23:48.583
So I turned to modeling because I knew that I could make money quick doing that.

23:49.264 --> 23:54.477
And it wasn't quite as quick as I had hoped because, like everything else, you have to sort of build your way up.

23:54.693 --> 24:02.069
But finally, I actually went to Japan as a model, which was so hilarious because all I wanted to do was go to Europe.

24:02.109 --> 24:07.981
And it was sort of like the means ended up overshooting the ends so extremely.

24:08.041 --> 24:15.537
By the time I got to Europe, it seemed so familiar after Tokyo, where I had gone just as a way of trying to earn money.

24:15.517 --> 24:16.981
So it was pretty hilarious.

24:17.082 --> 24:20.933
But I did finally, you know, drop the modeling.

24:20.953 --> 24:26.168
Still, with time left before college, you know, bought my backpack and went through Europe.

24:26.570 --> 24:32.597
And so that is partly why I have turned to that subject matter a couple of times.

24:32.777 --> 24:54.062
But I think, too, that the reason, even more than the fact that it happened to me, because there are certainly plenty of things I've done that have not found their way into my writing, is that because I am fascinated by image culture and the peculiar power that it has over people, the ways in which fashion pictures or really all sorts of media imagery works,

24:54.397 --> 25:04.266
do more than just, you know, offer up what seems to be, you know, a more attractive world, but really sort of pull on our emotions and our spirits in some way.

25:05.627 --> 25:13.675
That world seems very rich to me as a world to explore fictionally, although I've done it successfully very few times.

25:13.875 --> 25:18.960
I mean, I think Emerald City, the title story, is not one of the strongest in the collection at all.

25:19.300 --> 25:20.742
So why is it the title story?

25:20.862 --> 25:21.923
Because I like the title.

25:22.163 --> 25:22.243
Hmm.

25:22.223 --> 25:24.629
I think it's the right title for the book.

25:24.970 --> 25:30.764
Looking back, I think maybe I should have retitled the story so that the story would not have been the title story.

25:31.406 --> 25:33.411
But I wasn't sure what to do.

25:33.511 --> 25:36.418
I like the title and I think it's right for the book.

25:36.635 --> 25:39.800
But the title story I don't think is the best.

25:39.920 --> 25:42.984
I think The Stylist is a better story, the other one about models.

25:43.906 --> 25:47.871
And that was actually the first story I published, so that also means a lot to me.

25:49.334 --> 25:52.238
So, you know, so there are a number of reasons I've drawn to that world.

25:53.179 --> 25:55.082
But, you know, it's...

25:55.788 --> 25:59.032
I don't think there's anything innately interesting about it.

25:59.192 --> 26:01.556
No, I think you gave me a very effective answer.

26:01.596 --> 26:07.083
The image stuff is really what I was kind of hoping you'd say, actually.

26:07.744 --> 26:08.605
So that's good.

26:08.665 --> 26:14.312
Yeah, I'm really... That's very interesting to me, and I don't feel that I've exhausted it either.

26:14.372 --> 26:16.756
Now, do you consider yourself a storyteller?

26:18.278 --> 26:23.044
And have you always had this knack for telling stories?

26:23.084 --> 26:25.407
I think that I...

26:26.990 --> 26:28.538
Or are they stories in your mind?

26:28.619 --> 26:29.745
Oh, well, they are stories.

26:29.825 --> 26:30.308
It's funny.

26:30.429 --> 26:34.249
I see myself more as a storyteller.

26:34.820 --> 26:37.383
I want to find a better word than consumer.

26:37.764 --> 26:39.466
I love stories.

26:39.586 --> 26:42.650
I think when I write stories, I'm telling myself the stories.

26:43.471 --> 26:49.779
I'm not someone who leaps up at a party and wants to tell a long yarn and have everyone listen to me.

26:50.180 --> 26:52.923
I find that I get very self-conscious in those circumstances.

26:55.767 --> 27:02.616
But finally, I think narratives involving people, for reasons I don't even fully understand, seem to...

27:03.457 --> 27:06.843
compel me and linger in my memory more than anything else.

27:08.125 --> 27:21.988
I will meet someone at a party and remember that I met them five years ago and that their sister has cerebral palsy, but I can't remember who fought in the Crimean War, even though I wrote papers on it and studied it in great detail.

27:22.137 --> 27:24.359
I hate that about myself.

27:24.960 --> 27:26.422
I feel like something's wrong.

27:26.442 --> 27:34.951
I mean, my head is full of really not useful information involving people, but obviously that's what really interests me.

27:35.832 --> 27:42.639
And so I'm someone who, I look for stories, I respond to stories, and in the course of all that, I write them.

27:44.140 --> 27:44.841
And how about people?

27:44.921 --> 27:48.465
I mean, in terms of characters, are you constantly...

27:49.120 --> 27:51.123
filing things away.

27:51.403 --> 27:56.289
No, I tend to, at least consciously, I don't really work from my own life at all.

27:56.890 --> 27:59.193
Of course, there's a certain fallacy in that.

27:59.213 --> 28:13.271
I mean, obviously, I'm working from my own life all the time, but I almost need to kid myself into thinking that these stories have nothing to do with me, which I think, again, gets at the sense that I feel as if I'm entertaining myself to some degree when I write these things.

28:13.452 --> 28:18.418
I need to feel that I don't know what's going to happen and that it's almost as if I'm reading it.

28:18.398 --> 28:20.821
You mean as you're writing it?

28:21.442 --> 28:21.963
Exactly.

28:22.243 --> 28:27.250
If I think, oh, I met this guy on the subway, and he was so funny, and maybe I'll write a story about him.

28:27.530 --> 28:28.451
Oh, I couldn't do it.

28:29.412 --> 28:41.869
So it's almost like, sometimes I think it's almost like trying to sort of trick a kid into doing something that they might not do or want to do if they knew exactly what they were doing.

28:42.109 --> 28:43.751
I think that kid is sometimes me.

28:44.913 --> 28:45.013
Yeah.

28:45.601 --> 28:56.474
And I have to feel a sense of, a childlike sense of being beguiled and led on a secret, exciting journey.

28:56.534 --> 29:00.158
And it's that feeling that makes me write.

29:00.859 --> 29:06.266
And also something more serious, and I don't want to make it sound like I'm just sort of sitting here with a weird grin on my face all the time.

29:06.606 --> 29:07.407
I think there's...

29:08.585 --> 29:20.969
I mean, again, this is strange to me that I could believe this, but as I'm writing, I tend to feel the sense that it's tremendously important that I write this, that something will change as a result of writing it.

29:21.429 --> 29:30.627
And writing has always had that, I've always had that feeling when I wrote, even writing, you know, arcane papers in college for grad courses on, you know,

29:30.607 --> 29:44.534
folkloric, you know, folkloric analyses of the last 20 years, there was always a sense of urgency for me in tackling any sort of problem through writing.

29:44.995 --> 29:51.127
And I find that to be the case, you know, working on fiction as well, perhaps even more so than nonfiction.

29:51.809 --> 29:52.530
And

29:53.084 --> 29:56.807
And so that's another feeling that pulls me through it as I'm doing it.

29:56.967 --> 29:58.849
It's the sense that it's important and urgent.

29:58.889 --> 30:03.713
Looking back, you know, has one word that I've written changed anything in the world?

30:04.374 --> 30:05.134
I don't think so.

30:05.855 --> 30:08.878
But I feel that it will, and I don't question the feeling.

30:10.059 --> 30:16.164
I'm just, I'm sorry, I'm looking at your tour here, your reading tour, and I see you're going out to Madison, Wisconsin.

30:18.266 --> 30:19.467
I occasionally sell to that.

30:19.487 --> 30:21.569
Maybe I'll try.

30:21.589 --> 30:22.990
Actually, you've already done...

30:23.797 --> 30:25.782
What's that, oh, that's Madison, Connecticut?

30:25.802 --> 30:26.344
Is that right?

30:26.384 --> 30:28.069
Yeah, but I am going to Madison, Wisconsin.

30:28.089 --> 30:28.690
Yeah, okay.

30:28.710 --> 30:29.773
Which I've never been to.

30:30.215 --> 30:33.143
Nor have I, but... But that's a real university town.

30:33.203 --> 30:38.076
Yeah, it is, and they've taken some of my stories, but Milwaukee I sell more to, so I've had to...

30:38.798 --> 30:46.889
Even though they take like one a month, they pay more for one story than Madison does for like 20 or 10, you know.

30:46.909 --> 30:47.770
I liked Milwaukee.

30:47.790 --> 30:52.857
I went there last time and I really, if they add more cities, I want to go back to Milwaukee because I really liked it.

30:52.877 --> 30:55.501
Well, I'm going to, I'll give Lois a call out there then.

30:55.581 --> 30:57.103
Maybe I can pitch this story to her.

30:57.123 --> 31:03.372
Well, actually do because I just got a really nice note from her in response to a story I had written for the New York Times.

31:03.352 --> 31:03.854
Yeah.

31:03.874 --> 31:04.937
I'll call her right now, then.

31:05.118 --> 31:06.081
Yeah.

31:06.121 --> 31:08.930
She interviewed me when I was in Milwaukee, and I liked her so much.

31:08.950 --> 31:10.415
For this book or for the previous book?

31:10.776 --> 31:11.779
For the previous book.

31:11.799 --> 31:11.899
Yeah.

31:11.919 --> 31:14.849
Well, if she used it, then it's... I'll try.

31:14.869 --> 31:16.855
But generally speaking, they don't...

31:17.594 --> 31:24.367
That's hard, you know, to follow up with a feature on the next book, but I'll try it anyway.

31:24.387 --> 31:29.617
Well, see what you can do, because this note was so nice, and she said, oh, please let me know if you're coming back, and, you know.

31:29.797 --> 31:30.238
Oh, really?

31:30.298 --> 31:30.659
Yeah.

31:30.799 --> 31:31.461
Well, I'll give her a call.

31:31.481 --> 31:34.126
And I'm not coming back, so this is a perfect moment for you to step in.

31:34.146 --> 31:40.598
Yeah, I really, I just did a piece on Stephen Ambrose, where I did it for PW, and then I modified it for newspapers, and, uh,

31:40.898 --> 31:41.900
And she grabbed that.

31:41.920 --> 31:42.701
She is great.

31:42.861 --> 31:43.522
I really like her.

31:43.562 --> 31:44.083
I love her.

31:44.103 --> 31:45.645
I mean, I'm getting a lot of work from her.

31:45.906 --> 31:46.086
Yeah.

31:46.827 --> 31:51.855
In fact, I kind of... But any time I sell her a story, I can't offer it to Madison.

31:51.895 --> 31:55.080
You know, that's the thing.

31:55.942 --> 31:56.402
Oh, okay.

31:56.443 --> 31:58.826
But that's my problem, you know.

31:58.846 --> 31:59.047
Right.

31:59.067 --> 32:01.651
And she doesn't even want me to offer it down in Chicago, either.

32:02.352 --> 32:02.532
Oh.

32:02.833 --> 32:05.657
Well, that's my original hometown, so...

32:05.637 --> 32:07.661
That's actually pretty good.

32:07.701 --> 32:08.643
Okay, that's right.

32:08.843 --> 32:10.065
You said briefly schooling.

32:10.105 --> 32:13.191
Just tell me about your schooling again.

32:13.211 --> 32:15.536
A couple of fast biographical things here.

32:15.556 --> 32:18.241
Okay, went to public high school in San Francisco.

32:18.541 --> 32:20.545
Okay, and if you don't mind, he's telling me your age.

32:20.685 --> 32:21.427
Not at all, 33.

32:21.908 --> 32:24.152
Okay, that's very young.

32:24.132 --> 32:24.913
It's funny.

32:25.034 --> 32:32.005
It feels old to me, but I think you're always the oldest you've ever been, so there's always a sense of amazement that you could be this old.

32:32.025 --> 32:36.393
Well, I mean, coming out with a novel and a story collection.

32:36.413 --> 32:46.149
Well, of course, I think to me it seems old because I had these notions of being one of these 20-something Brat Packers, although looking back, I'm so happy I wasn't.

32:46.230 --> 32:48.874
I think it would be terrible now, you know?

32:48.854 --> 33:11.993
well i certainly classified them all and it wasn't positively no i think i think i didn't have a high opinion of the whole lot of them i don't think any of them really benefited from that association some of them have certainly survived one of them is michael chabon chabon i guess he's he's come through it pretty well he's not he's also he's my age he's not really one of them i mean he emerged a little later

33:11.973 --> 33:14.857
I just met him last week, and I liked him a lot.

33:14.897 --> 33:16.380
Yeah, oh, he is a sweetheart.

33:16.640 --> 33:19.104
Yeah, very, very, very nice young man, actually.

33:19.164 --> 33:22.509
Extremely nice, very funny, and, you know, not arrogant.

33:22.589 --> 33:23.670
He's a wonderful guy.

33:23.710 --> 33:24.472
Oh, nice.

33:25.393 --> 33:31.662
But anyway, so, yeah, so public high school in San Francisco, then went to University of Pennsylvania.

33:32.103 --> 33:32.243
Mm-hmm.

33:32.223 --> 33:33.965
That's good.

33:34.005 --> 33:37.689
See, I occasionally, I got two papers in Pennsylvania that will take things.

33:38.410 --> 33:38.750
Oh, great.

33:38.770 --> 33:41.853
If I can get some kind of a Pennsylvania wrangle in it, you know.

33:41.873 --> 33:45.297
And I'm also going to Philly for a couple of days in March.

33:45.317 --> 33:45.998
Are they doing you?

33:47.179 --> 33:48.500
Not to my knowledge, no.

33:48.580 --> 33:50.542
I don't think anything is set up.

33:50.562 --> 33:53.786
Let me give Diane, what's her name?

33:54.647 --> 33:57.690
Ann Coulson is the preacher's editor down there.

33:58.143 --> 33:59.328
That would be wonderful.

33:59.348 --> 34:03.183
But if they send Carl and Romano, whatever.

34:03.223 --> 34:05.071
They have their own people, too.

34:05.452 --> 34:06.617
Right.

34:07.289 --> 34:11.156
I'm sure nothing's set up yet because it's so early.

34:11.196 --> 34:13.220
It seems like she does a little closer to the time.

34:13.861 --> 34:20.933
But sometimes I can, if I know that you're going down there and they haven't assigned that they could take it to.

34:21.374 --> 34:21.915
Okay, go ahead.

34:21.935 --> 34:22.316
I'm sorry.

34:22.356 --> 34:24.881
You've got that whole schedule, including Philly, right?

34:25.963 --> 34:26.243
Let's see.

34:26.303 --> 34:27.285
Does it say Philly?

34:27.525 --> 34:28.487
March 20th.

34:28.957 --> 34:30.240
Yes, the last one.

34:30.320 --> 34:30.821
Okay.

34:30.842 --> 34:31.563
Yep, go ahead.

34:31.944 --> 34:34.129
So, University of Pennsylvania, graduated in 85.

34:34.450 --> 34:41.226
I won a Turan scholarship to study in England for two years, which I did at St.

34:41.286 --> 34:43.452
John's College, Cambridge.

34:44.013 --> 34:44.254
Nice.

34:44.514 --> 34:46.138
Isn't Cambridge beautiful?

34:46.490 --> 34:50.837
I just, every time, I can't even believe I lived in such a beautiful place.

34:50.937 --> 34:51.598
It really is.

34:51.738 --> 34:53.020
I've got Cambridge in my book.

34:53.120 --> 34:57.467
I went up and did the Peeps Library over at Marlon College.

34:57.487 --> 35:02.795
It is just, I mean, you know, riding around on a bicycle on these little medieval streets.

35:02.915 --> 35:05.038
I mean, it couldn't have been more fun.

35:05.018 --> 35:09.686
Because my scholarship was so generous, I was able to do a lot of traveling.

35:09.746 --> 35:11.068
That's when I went to China.

35:11.449 --> 35:20.985
I went to the Soviet Union, the then Soviet Union, including really unusual places like Tashkent and Samarkand and Kukara.

35:20.965 --> 35:25.629
those Central Asian provinces, which I think are pretty hard to go to now.

35:25.969 --> 35:30.053
So I'm so glad I did that, as well as, you know, all over Europe.

35:31.154 --> 35:35.437
So that was really, I was able to satisfy a lot of wanderlust in those two years.

35:35.517 --> 35:36.738
I would say so.

35:36.998 --> 35:44.505
And really, I have barely moved since, because once I came back here, I really had to sort of face the music, and I've had no money, really, ever since.

35:44.545 --> 35:50.770
It is kind of interesting, though, that instead of going west, young woman, I mean, you've...

35:51.155 --> 35:53.999
You've chosen the Northeast to live in.

35:54.019 --> 35:54.720
Well, I know.

35:54.820 --> 36:01.869
I think part of it is that even though I did grow up in California, my roots are so much kind of industrial Midwestern.

36:01.889 --> 36:12.624
And in a funny way, this felt very – I mean, being back among the seasons and in a grittier sort of urban atmosphere felt very familiar to me.

36:13.024 --> 36:15.728
And also, I think I just – I really was –

36:15.708 --> 36:19.756
For some reason I was absolutely determined to live in New York.

36:19.896 --> 36:21.358
I now question that decision.

36:21.399 --> 36:22.781
I love New York.

36:23.122 --> 36:26.608
But there's something about it that is just thrilling.

36:26.628 --> 36:31.337
I think all of the sense of wanting to find...

36:31.807 --> 36:41.408
someplace rich and fascinating and going as far as I could away from my home to try to find that into all kinds of wacky places in the world.

36:42.009 --> 36:49.345
I think New York is the place that's, you know, in America that comes closest to satisfying that desire for exoticism.

36:49.846 --> 36:51.790
And it's more than that.

36:51.770 --> 36:55.275
You can absolutely make it there on your wits and on your skills.

36:55.635 --> 36:57.417
And that's all they care about, too.

36:57.878 --> 37:01.242
I mean, every day I meet people who are smart and interesting.

37:01.262 --> 37:02.905
That is not the case in most cities.

37:02.925 --> 37:03.445
No, that's true.

37:03.886 --> 37:05.388
Boston comes close, though.

37:05.428 --> 37:06.229
Boston is great.

37:06.269 --> 37:08.071
Actually, my husband's family is from Boston.

37:08.151 --> 37:08.512
Is that right?

37:08.532 --> 37:11.736
Yeah, and I love going there to visit them.

37:11.716 --> 37:35.766
so yeah boston is terrific and you know and i love philadelphia too i mean i i think that um you know any of those places would be great for me but i i it's funny my mother um you know who still lives in san francisco was visiting she visits all the time and we got in a cab and um and she turned to me i had an exchange with the driver and she said that's it you are really a new yorker and what i had said to the driver was

37:35.746 --> 37:36.628
I'd gotten in.

37:36.668 --> 37:37.610
We were not in a hurry.

37:37.631 --> 37:38.733
We were going to a museum.

37:38.793 --> 37:45.509
The guy barely spoke English, and I leaned forward and sort of poked my head into the front of the cab and said, so, what's your game plan?

37:45.530 --> 37:48.817
He said, that's it.

37:48.918 --> 37:50.060
You're never coming back.

37:50.261 --> 37:50.943
I can tell.

37:51.083 --> 37:53.248
I am going to just accept it.

37:53.228 --> 37:55.331
You belong here in New York.

37:55.371 --> 37:56.372
That's a cute story.

37:56.953 --> 37:57.754
And it's true.

37:57.874 --> 37:59.997
I am so New York by temperament.

38:00.097 --> 38:01.038
I'm impatient.

38:01.159 --> 38:16.679
I get frustrated in a second, but I'm also very, I'm sort of emotional and kind of very generous in certain moments, too, in that very sort of, you know, one minute the New Yorker wants to punch you and the next minute they're hugging you.

38:16.779 --> 38:18.021
I'm very much like that.

38:18.558 --> 38:19.239
That's cute.

38:19.579 --> 38:22.283
Tell me quickly, and we've got plenty of stuff here, by the way.

38:24.046 --> 38:32.017
Tell me quickly about your job working with the Countess of... The Countess of Romanones.

38:32.338 --> 38:33.079
Romanones.

38:33.099 --> 38:36.043
Your paths haven't crossed because she has published many books.

38:36.363 --> 38:36.904
Right.

38:36.884 --> 38:41.996
She's American-born, actually, from Pearl River, New York.

38:42.036 --> 38:43.679
So she's the Countess of Romanones.

38:43.699 --> 38:44.301
I love that.

38:44.321 --> 38:44.842
I know.

38:44.862 --> 38:51.878
Well, she was a spy during World War II in Spain and ended up meeting and marrying a count, hence her title.

38:52.178 --> 38:56.428
And she then lived there, spent basically most of her adult life there.

38:56.830 --> 39:07.735
She moved back here maybe, I don't know, I guess about eight or nine years ago and began writing these books about her spying experiences, the first of which was The Spy War Red, which was actually a huge bestseller.

39:08.305 --> 39:09.767
It's a very familiar title, yeah.

39:10.048 --> 39:17.278
And so she needed a secretary, and I was broke and frantically temping and doing everything I could think of to try and make ends meet.

39:17.318 --> 39:21.725
And so we just sort of fell into each other's lives.

39:22.466 --> 39:27.293
And I worked for her every day from 1 to 6 in the afternoon.

39:27.273 --> 39:29.036
It was quite an experience.

39:29.457 --> 39:29.958
I would say.

39:30.198 --> 39:38.292
I mean, she is a colorful, vibrant, visceral, difficult woman, and she made life very hard for me.

39:38.332 --> 39:40.796
I think she would be the first to admit that.

39:41.157 --> 39:52.977
On the other hand, it was fascinating because there were so many things going on there that I had never really seen firsthand, one of which is this sort of dying European aristocracy that still,

39:52.957 --> 39:55.310
takes itself very seriously.

39:56.355 --> 40:00.216
She would get invitations from Russian nobility.

40:00.736 --> 40:01.978
These people are out there.

40:01.998 --> 40:03.079
They are giving parties.

40:03.119 --> 40:04.461
They are buying dresses.

40:04.521 --> 40:05.102
Oh, listen.

40:05.242 --> 40:08.307
I just did an interview with Bob Massey a couple weeks ago, you know.

40:08.507 --> 40:16.859
And, I mean, this whole thing about burying the czar's bones is because they're all fighting about they all want to go back and be the next czar.

40:16.999 --> 40:17.280
Exactly.

40:17.300 --> 40:19.082
I mean, that was fascinating.

40:19.363 --> 40:24.330
And she was, you know, in New York, part of this very, you know, upper crust society.

40:24.310 --> 40:40.986
society that included people like Malcolm Forbes you know I mean these people were at her house all the time she would have dinner parties and I mean one that I'll never forget her close friends were the Reagans who were of course in office at that time and

40:41.422 --> 40:45.631
She had a dinner party for Nancy Reagan, and the guest list was just beyond belief.

40:45.691 --> 40:48.597
I mean, it included Malcolm Forbes, Mike Wallace.

40:48.617 --> 40:49.299
And you were there?

40:49.780 --> 40:53.347
I wasn't at the dinner, but I was, of course, organizing every detail of it.

40:53.628 --> 40:58.438
But we had a slight hitch that morning, which was that the Countess's apartment building caught on fire.

40:58.458 --> 40:58.719
Jesus.

40:59.120 --> 41:00.763
And all the power went out.

41:00.743 --> 41:04.668
And it literally was, I mean, it was really burned.

41:04.808 --> 41:07.131
I mean, the elevators didn't work.

41:07.151 --> 41:08.332
There were soot all over the walls.

41:08.372 --> 41:09.313
It was a disaster.

41:09.614 --> 41:14.980
But she had such a will of iron, she would not relinquish this dinner party.

41:15.360 --> 41:22.008
So thus began this insane day of lying to the Secret Service and saying, oh, everything is fine.

41:22.028 --> 41:22.609
No kidding.

41:22.709 --> 41:23.410
And it went off?

41:23.390 --> 41:24.552
It happened.

41:24.692 --> 41:25.433
She had the party.

41:25.473 --> 41:27.416
She had everyone bring candelabra.

41:28.217 --> 41:28.677
It was great.

41:28.978 --> 41:31.001
You know, it was Donald Trump was there.

41:31.021 --> 41:37.009
I mean, it was just, you know, these sorts of experiences for someone, especially someone not from New York.

41:37.069 --> 41:38.832
I mean, when would you ever have these?

41:38.852 --> 41:39.453
Yeah, that's great.

41:39.473 --> 41:41.656
So it was very thrilling in its way.

41:41.676 --> 41:47.884
And I worked for her for two years, and she has been so supportive of my career ever since, which I really appreciate.

41:47.964 --> 41:48.385
Yeah.

41:48.365 --> 41:50.489
And so what are you working on now, another novel?

41:51.069 --> 41:55.617
I am working on another novel, extremely different from the first.

41:56.478 --> 42:06.495
And I'm also, you know, I did this cover story for the New York Times Magazine that came out a couple of weeks ago, and that was really, it was the first real attempt I had made at journalism.

42:06.976 --> 42:08.779
I should see this now.

42:09.079 --> 42:12.465
It's actually about, it's about models, interestingly.

42:12.665 --> 42:14.653
A couple weeks ago?

42:15.055 --> 42:18.970
Yeah, it's Sunday, February 4th.

42:19.071 --> 42:21.661
I should still have that.

42:21.782 --> 42:21.882
Okay.

42:22.553 --> 42:26.257
And so that was just an amazing experience.

42:26.298 --> 42:28.420
I mean, I loved doing the research.

42:28.540 --> 42:32.946
It's a very sort of literary approach for the magazine.

42:33.146 --> 42:35.509
Did they approach you for that, or did you pitch it?

42:35.569 --> 42:46.502
Yeah, they did, although they knew that they wanted something on this industry, and they knew that I had written about it before, but they really did want sort of a fiction writer's perspective.

42:47.174 --> 42:51.002
So I really lucked out in being kind of uniquely qualified for that.

42:51.263 --> 42:52.946
Who did you deal with, just out of curiosity?

42:52.966 --> 42:53.908
Jerry Marzarotti.

42:54.329 --> 42:55.532
Oh, okay.

42:55.612 --> 42:57.195
I think he's sort of number three there.

42:57.235 --> 43:00.863
I'm just thinking of some stories for them, too.

43:01.083 --> 43:05.272
The exposure of that thing is what's amazing.

43:05.292 --> 43:07.697
I did an essay for the New York Times Book Review.

43:08.707 --> 43:11.433
which was page one, and it was the longest essay.

43:11.493 --> 43:13.237
Remember they used to run those book essays?

43:13.417 --> 43:13.818
Oh, yeah.

43:13.838 --> 43:15.763
When Becky Sinclair was still there?

43:15.783 --> 43:16.264
Yeah.

43:16.284 --> 43:20.694
And I did one that ran five pages, and it absolutely extended.

43:20.894 --> 43:23.560
I had to put the response to that thing.

43:23.995 --> 43:26.778
I mean, meant that I had to work two more years in the book.

43:26.898 --> 43:32.984
I mean, stuff started coming my way that had never, that had been denied, you know.

43:33.004 --> 43:33.664
I know.

43:33.864 --> 43:37.788
You all of a sudden had entree to levels and to people.

43:38.149 --> 43:38.469
I know.

43:38.529 --> 43:42.473
I did this woman, Louise Taper, who just got written up with him in the New York Times two weeks ago.

43:42.493 --> 43:45.956
She has this incomparable Lincoln collection, which is in Chicago now.

43:46.296 --> 43:46.717
Right.

43:47.097 --> 43:48.258
And I did that.

43:48.478 --> 43:49.780
I've been the only interview with her.

43:49.820 --> 43:53.243
I mean, up until that time, she wouldn't talk to anybody, you know.

43:53.223 --> 43:54.384
That's so amazing.

43:54.404 --> 44:05.076
I know it's a stamp of legitimacy that just, I mean, in a way it's ridiculous, but at least it's a validation of who you are, especially if you're not known, if you're very regional and you're not known.

44:05.176 --> 44:05.656
Exactly.

44:05.697 --> 44:10.442
Or in my case, you know, I mean, nonfiction writers do not take fiction writers very seriously.

44:10.482 --> 44:14.806
So for me, it was an amazing chance to cross over and I don't want to lose that.

44:14.967 --> 44:18.150
I want to do more pieces for them and maybe for others.

44:18.130 --> 44:19.973
That's why I keep my column every week.

44:19.993 --> 44:28.107
I don't make any money on it to speak of, but it does allow me to write every week for several million people.

44:28.828 --> 44:31.312
Yeah, that's not something you want to discount.

44:31.793 --> 44:34.958
Having caught that bug, it's very hard for me to imagine.

44:35.208 --> 44:36.772
It does give you a discipline, too.

44:37.093 --> 44:48.581
It gives you a discipline, and it gives you... I think, you know, now that I can't... I'm never going to be able to afford the kind of traveling that I've done in the past, because I don't want to travel necessarily with a backpack at 33 years old.

44:48.601 --> 44:48.741
No.

44:49.042 --> 44:51.428
This is a way to travel without really...

44:51.408 --> 44:54.596
Well, almost with portfolio, you know what I mean?

44:54.616 --> 44:54.817
Exactly.

44:55.057 --> 45:01.855
And I think you get that fabulous experience of being able to walk into someone else's life and house and see what they do.

45:01.895 --> 45:03.038
It's great.

45:03.078 --> 45:07.830
I've told my wife this next book, we're really going to travel tremendously.

45:07.810 --> 45:09.494
Oh, I think that'll be great.

45:09.815 --> 45:12.723
And I mean, it's going to be like I'm going to do a tour through history.

45:12.863 --> 45:16.593
You know, we're going to start in Ephesus and Turkey and Bergamo.

45:16.613 --> 45:17.956
That's where I went on my honeymoon.

45:18.157 --> 45:19.841
Isn't it magnificent?

45:19.861 --> 45:23.811
Well, you know, there's a restored library there from it's over 2000 years old.

45:23.791 --> 45:47.757
at ephesus yeah yeah i know i went in it yeah and then and then well that's where i'm starting my next book and that's going to be continuum one the chapter continuum one which will just take you through these important stops through history you know the the uh the monastery at saint gaul in switzerland where all the great manuscripts of the middle ages were copied and and on the island of patmos uh

45:47.737 --> 45:49.258
We're at the Monastery of St.

45:49.319 --> 45:51.841
John for 900 years, uninterrupted.

45:51.921 --> 45:53.723
You know, they have this monastic library.

45:54.444 --> 45:55.485
So that kind of stuff.

45:55.505 --> 45:56.386
Oh, I think that sounds amazing.

45:56.406 --> 45:57.166
It's really great.

45:57.206 --> 45:58.027
We've never been to St.

45:58.107 --> 46:01.210
Petersburg, so we've got to go see Catherine the Great's books.

46:01.270 --> 46:01.951
Absolutely.

46:02.151 --> 46:03.853
Oh, this is going to take you to some great places.

46:03.873 --> 46:05.434
Well, it's going to cost a lot of dough.

46:05.715 --> 46:07.336
Get a good advance.

46:07.376 --> 46:08.297
You've earned it.

46:08.317 --> 46:10.339
We're working on it now as we speak.

46:10.379 --> 46:14.183
And for the first time in my life, I'm going to shut off the tape recorder now because we've got plenty of stuff.
