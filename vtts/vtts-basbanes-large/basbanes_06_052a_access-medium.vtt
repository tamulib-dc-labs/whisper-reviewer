WEBVTT

00:03.440 --> 00:05.202
We're on side three.

00:06.223 --> 00:06.944
Say that again.

00:07.544 --> 00:09.026
Something left into somebody's hands.

00:09.046 --> 00:14.111
All of the books that Carter wanted left into his hands in a fantastically short period of time.

00:15.293 --> 00:17.775
He got William Carlos Williams' first book from me.

00:19.197 --> 00:20.598
It's been the only copy.

00:20.638 --> 00:25.544
He got numerous books, the only one copy, and there are many in modern literature.

00:25.564 --> 00:28.587
He got a staggering number of wonderful books.

00:29.748 --> 00:40.266
And the only penalty he had to pay is that he might have been expected to buy one each of books that were not rare, but he certainly got good copies of those books, and he didn't necessarily pay too much for them.

00:41.469 --> 00:44.334
So he was extraordinarily well served.

00:45.055 --> 00:49.242
Is the Carter Britton phenomenon a unique phenomenon in your experience?

00:49.262 --> 00:52.247
It is in modern literature.

00:52.388 --> 00:53.730
It is unique in my experience.

00:54.200 --> 01:10.220
is that people with money in that quantity to spend, and mind you, say he spent $20 million, and I don't think it... It's an absurdly small amount of money, given the amount of money out in the world, and who has it?

01:10.440 --> 01:20.252
Book people don't ever, aren't ever... Book people of my acquaintance are not usually in that framework of sales.

01:20.712 --> 01:21.253
I can remember...

01:22.432 --> 01:33.343
Jake Zeitlin smugly saying not long before he died that he had just sold to the Getty the collection of illuminated manuscripts for 40-some million dollars, and it was the largest... Can I just interrupt here?

01:33.423 --> 01:34.624
This is very important to me.

01:35.925 --> 01:40.610
I understand that they needed Zeitlin to sell that to Getty.

01:41.651 --> 01:42.812
Kroos tried to sell it.

01:43.953 --> 01:45.275
Was Kroos involved in that?

01:45.295 --> 01:45.775
Yes, yes, yes.

01:45.795 --> 01:48.618
And he couldn't do it, but the only way he could do it was with Jake.

01:48.638 --> 01:49.699
I'm sure that that's true.

01:50.600 --> 01:51.561
I'm sure that that's true.

01:52.604 --> 01:57.292
It's simple, you know, certain... We can get Mel Ehlstein to tell me a bit.

01:57.312 --> 02:01.919
Well, no, it's probably a proper, and I'm not sure to what degree Mel was involved.

02:02.801 --> 02:04.243
He won't talk about acquisitions.

02:04.263 --> 02:06.146
Right, he shouldn't.

02:06.166 --> 02:18.747
It's a proper thing, and I don't know a thing about it, but I know how things work, and things work on the force of personal relationships, and Zeitlin was nothing if not a man who created personal relationships and unquestionably had a personal relationship with

02:19.435 --> 02:21.257
someone seriously representing Getty.

02:21.558 --> 02:22.679
So what's the dynamic here?

02:22.719 --> 02:25.142
Why couldn't Krauss do it with Getty?

02:25.162 --> 02:28.105
Because Krauss is almost surely not universally loved.

02:29.427 --> 02:31.910
What's that got to do with chess, as Bobby Fischer would say?

02:31.950 --> 02:35.034
Well, because Zeitlin was universally loved by it.

02:35.054 --> 02:37.136
I mean, they wanted the manuscripts, didn't they?

02:37.156 --> 02:39.299
No, there are other things to buy in the world.

02:39.719 --> 02:43.244
They're not primarily a book library, a book museum.

02:43.704 --> 02:46.928
But those limited manuscripts did represent medieval art.

02:47.650 --> 02:49.453
and the finest aspect of it.

02:49.813 --> 02:52.136
It was a worthy acquisition, and they paid a big price.

02:53.358 --> 03:05.055
But my point was that Zeitlin very smugly told the Denver Book Soldiers Convention that he had just that moment finished the deal, which was almost surely the largest book deal that will ever occur, forty-some million dollars.

03:05.976 --> 03:07.619
And I thought, ho-hum, you know.

03:07.639 --> 03:10.623
I mean, sure, it was a nice collection.

03:10.683 --> 03:11.885
It was the greatest of its kind.

03:11.905 --> 03:17.573
There won't be any more collections of ancient Luminati manuscripts changing hands at that level.

03:18.295 --> 03:24.164
But, you know, who cares that there was $47 million?

03:24.304 --> 03:32.516
I can spend $47 million usefully if I have $47 million to spend, and I'll come up with some wonderful things, and they won't be the same.

03:33.297 --> 03:41.569
The hang-up with all bookselling is if you think you can sell the same book or the same item or replicate exactly what you've done before instead of

03:42.899 --> 04:04.519
doing what you're really doing selling that which comes to hand most usefully to those who most want it no matter what it is so you can't of course continue to sell collections of illuminated medieval manuscripts but i didn't much care for the smugness that he was part and party to the biggest deal yet then ever made

04:05.427 --> 04:34.320
when the accident of the Getty having an embarrassment to spend 800 million dollars a year they have to spend doesn't ennoble Jake Zeitlin for being the intermediary in a book deal on the force of his personality but one can at least credit him with being the intermediary and of being trusted on both sides

04:35.313 --> 04:37.055
And that's sort of the end of it.

04:37.335 --> 04:40.539
I would hope that I was the intermediary in some transaction.

04:40.639 --> 04:43.102
I'm always the intermediary in some transaction or other.

04:43.122 --> 04:47.407
And the fact that it was a lot of money is really not very relevant.

04:48.268 --> 04:51.351
Well, to go back to money, we're talking 47 million.

04:51.672 --> 04:54.114
Yeah, big bucks, big bucks.

04:54.295 --> 05:01.062
Yeah, the question... On a single... Right, right.

05:01.082 --> 05:02.384
And some dealer makes a commission.

05:03.806 --> 05:05.067
If you're determined to...

05:05.705 --> 05:10.531
be on the level of transactions in which the numbers are large, then your commissions would be large.

05:11.692 --> 05:18.821
And how you get there, you can either get there through breeding or birth or force of will, or you can ratchet your way up the ladder.

05:18.881 --> 05:23.847
There are a few dealers, very few, but there are a few that have ratcheted up the ladder.

05:23.867 --> 05:30.996
Heritage has ratcheted himself up and Glenn has ratcheted himself up as fast as possible.

05:31.637 --> 05:34.260
And somebody like Colin Franklin was...

05:34.510 --> 05:39.658
in style and temperament and mode and dress born to the role of doing things like that.

05:39.678 --> 05:50.674
But we are not prevented from selling wonderful things to respected clients by whoever we are in general.

05:50.854 --> 05:59.607
It may take Jake to be the connector in that instance, but I'm quite confident that in a T-shirt and overalls and

06:00.380 --> 06:11.298
And with too many drinks in me, I could also be the worthy intermediary between A and B with any kind of material.

06:11.358 --> 06:17.589
So there is no, the book business cuts away with much of pretense and status.

06:18.410 --> 06:21.015
And the goods usually speak for themselves, although not always.

06:21.676 --> 06:23.218
We talked about one phenomenon.

06:23.339 --> 06:25.442
Let's talk about another, haven or more.

06:25.878 --> 06:28.181
But I know nothing about Haven O'Moore.

06:28.522 --> 06:32.327
I'm not qualified to speak of him in any way.

06:32.347 --> 06:33.168
I never sold him a book.

06:33.228 --> 06:33.849
I never met him.

06:34.070 --> 06:36.313
I don't know whose money he was spending or how much.

06:37.254 --> 06:49.892
The catalog that was published was bizarre and uninteresting and a collection of high spots smashed out of the world over the years.

06:50.793 --> 06:54.298
It's not very interesting to me because one, it doesn't

06:54.532 --> 06:55.533
tend to touch me.

06:56.073 --> 06:58.716
Obviously, each of the books is worthy in its way.

06:59.336 --> 07:07.403
But what Haven of More's motivations were and what the profits were and what the goal in the first place was, I have no knowledge whatsoever.

07:07.443 --> 07:10.806
I see things like that occurring.

07:10.846 --> 07:24.538
They often occur through the force of one man's personality or the imposition of a personality on another or simply the love or the emotional need of acquiring in the book world

07:24.738 --> 07:29.484
outstanding examples of books either themselves outstanding or interesting.

07:31.306 --> 07:43.940
And it's often a function of the amount of available cash and relationships with the kinds of dealers who can acquire the kinds of books that said person is interested in.

07:43.960 --> 07:49.567
These touch us from time to time.

07:49.587 --> 07:50.408
Clearly I'm

07:50.827 --> 08:06.542
interested in telling Richard Manning the kinds of things that are, as I imagined it, worthy of his attention, but which no one else but I can supply.

08:06.602 --> 08:08.504
And it is difficult.

08:08.684 --> 08:18.994
It is so difficult that one frequently wonders whether it's worth it, because one, in that instance, does not one feel trusted.

08:20.257 --> 08:25.724
And worse, one isn't certain that the material is appreciated.

08:26.425 --> 08:34.335
And yet, given where it comes from and who supplies it to me or with me, I don't doubt the material.

08:34.616 --> 08:49.335
And therefore, I'm constantly questioning the degree to which I have to struggle to make available the material that I think is worthy of

08:49.906 --> 08:52.990
Is Dick Manny a phenomenon or just an interesting player?

08:55.213 --> 08:56.514
Unusual.

08:56.534 --> 08:59.658
I mean, he collected antiques, collected art for six or seven years.

08:59.898 --> 09:01.921
Well, I don't regard him as a phenomenon, no.

09:02.221 --> 09:02.702
Interesting.

09:05.145 --> 09:07.027
Interesting for a very, very few people.

09:08.069 --> 09:09.070
Very few.

09:09.090 --> 09:09.530
What do you mean?

09:09.651 --> 09:10.291
Almost none.

09:10.572 --> 09:19.643
In terms of... Manny is totally motivated by his own determination of what it is that he should collect.

09:20.551 --> 09:22.374
I don't think he's fully defining it.

09:22.394 --> 09:24.597
And he's in the process of defining it.

09:24.717 --> 09:38.697
And one of the things that's nice about Manny is that he enjoys his wealth and he enjoys immensely the freedom that he has to choose what it is that he buys.

09:40.840 --> 09:46.828
One of the negatives is that I believe by profession he is a negotiator.

09:47.129 --> 09:49.372
By professional mediators.

09:49.432 --> 09:50.414
Well, I understand.

09:50.594 --> 10:00.469
I think he brokers, I mean, I'm not utterly privy to what he does, but he brokers media time to the networks for major advertisers.

10:00.489 --> 10:04.615
And he has to negotiate at all times.

10:05.195 --> 10:13.387
My guess is, though, one of the earliest times he met me, he told me that he had just sold a couple of vineyards in Southern California for somebody.

10:15.130 --> 10:16.512
And certainly he wasn't buying it for himself.

10:17.065 --> 10:18.246
So he had brokered the deal.

10:20.108 --> 10:37.186
Consequently, the most characteristic aspect of our relationship is that he feels it necessary to negotiate my price with me, always.

10:37.206 --> 10:44.254
And this is such a wearing and unnecessary aspect of our relationship.

10:46.124 --> 11:02.523
that I am constantly wondering whether I need to endure this when my motivation, cheaply, is to better the financial health of my source, who, although the best book person in L.A., is penniless.

11:02.603 --> 11:04.485
I mean, genuinely penniless.

11:04.505 --> 11:05.006
Penniless.

11:05.026 --> 11:06.147
His name is Brian Kirby.

11:06.167 --> 11:09.591
He's the best book person in Los Angeles.

11:09.611 --> 11:14.477
It is his current and consuming interest because he has only got

11:16.313 --> 11:18.577
for one interest at the moment is screenplay.

11:18.657 --> 11:22.964
He's the best screenplay person in the world.

11:22.984 --> 11:33.841
I don't really want to publicize the degree to which Brian and screenplays are one-on-one because it can only do him harm in terms of the ability to acquire them.

11:33.861 --> 11:36.405
But the fact is that he has come up with the most wonderful screenplay.

11:36.745 --> 11:44.177
I've known Brian since six weeks after he moved to Los Angeles, almost 30 years.

11:44.714 --> 11:45.955
He's always been instant screenplays.

11:45.995 --> 11:48.578
He's one of the few people who read screenplays from beginning to end.

11:48.598 --> 11:49.799
He's constantly reading them.

11:49.819 --> 11:51.701
He knows everything about screenplays.

11:51.721 --> 11:53.523
Can you guys talk to him?

11:54.084 --> 11:54.444
Sure.

11:55.205 --> 11:57.828
He's so utterly committed to screenplays.

12:00.130 --> 12:03.233
The fascination of screenplays would take a long time to talk about.

12:03.413 --> 12:04.655
You've written about this yourself.

12:04.695 --> 12:05.716
Only minimally.

12:06.937 --> 12:13.624
The fact is that they represent the single most largest aspect of unpublished writing by major writers.

12:13.975 --> 12:24.086
Not to mention the fact that they're also involved with film, which you can talk about from the film aspect, but there's a huge body of unpublished and uncollected work by innumerable writers.

12:25.027 --> 12:42.565
Brian turned up for me all of the Faulkner screenplays, I think it was for Warner Brothers at the time, or 20th Century Fox, that Virginia refused at $17,500, in which I sold to Howl, and which ended up with Brodsky for way over $100,000, in which Brodsky has turned into several books, and which was a

12:42.916 --> 12:48.762
an unbelievable and irreplaceable trove of material that was nowhere else represented.

12:50.423 --> 12:56.349
Consequently, I've had more screenplays by Faulkner than anybody could dream of, and no one else had had any.

12:56.569 --> 12:58.511
Why didn't you try and sell this to Brodsky?

12:58.531 --> 12:59.993
Why didn't you sell to Howell?

13:00.453 --> 13:05.018
Why didn't you have gotten a hundred K out of that?

13:05.118 --> 13:09.582
I didn't know Brodsky at the time, and Howell was my bookseller across the street, and was

13:10.338 --> 13:16.827
faithful and sustaining to lesser and humbler and poorer booksellers, and believed in what I believed in.

13:17.588 --> 13:19.811
I was happy with my profit at the time.

13:20.793 --> 13:21.974
That's irrelevant.

13:22.115 --> 13:23.476
Right.

13:23.897 --> 13:27.482
I went to the best customer I could find at the time.

13:27.502 --> 13:28.844
$60,000 was a lot of money.

13:31.047 --> 13:35.974
So, with regard to Richard Manning,

13:38.502 --> 13:39.323
He's a new player.

13:39.583 --> 13:44.249
He's certainly a new player.

13:44.269 --> 14:07.817
I watch him and... He has an attitude that I don't share, for which he has an elaborate rationale, and that is that he either enjoys and or is better off buying great books at auction because...

14:08.067 --> 14:25.552
at auction, he's getting them at the right price, and he is disallowing anybody the possibility of a profit on him, of course, except for the owner, except for 5%.

14:25.692 --> 14:30.379
Or no percent if he himself does the bidding.

14:31.420 --> 14:36.808
Now, I happen to be partial to the book trade rather than to the auctionist, the conduit medium for

14:37.801 --> 14:44.651
and all of these books prior to their having been at the auction were in the hands of booksellers.

14:44.691 --> 14:51.641
I think Richard likes the approval of the price that arrived at arbitrarily and fairly, i.e.

14:51.661 --> 15:03.417
to the book auction, whereas it is my responsibility and pleasure to try to sell Richard Manning things before they ever dreamed of getting to an auction, i.e.

15:03.498 --> 15:05.260
ahead of the market, if you will.

15:05.712 --> 15:09.996
on the basis of my private intelligence, enthusiasm, and source.

15:10.016 --> 15:15.502
And he is not necessarily comfortable with that sequence.

15:15.702 --> 15:25.973
Well, I think Krokes sold the four folios to Haven, though more, for $165,000, which went for $2 million.

15:26.133 --> 15:27.815
And how long ago?

15:28.095 --> 15:28.596
Not long.

15:28.636 --> 15:29.056
Right.

15:30.598 --> 15:34.842
But Richard is too much of a negotiator to not want to

15:38.146 --> 15:41.329
impose his will on mine with regard to my price.

15:41.809 --> 15:47.915
It is not the attitude of someone who has a lot of respect for the book trade.

15:49.236 --> 15:51.799
And I have total respect for the book trade.

15:54.441 --> 15:56.343
And consequently there's a tussle there.

15:56.363 --> 16:04.871
And I am profoundly uncomfortable with it.

16:05.131 --> 16:06.853
And it's my responsibility.

16:07.340 --> 16:21.521
on behalf of my own welfare and certainly on behalf of my friend who needs the money to administer my end of this relationship as long as there's a relationship.

16:21.541 --> 16:22.142
Let's move on.

16:23.043 --> 16:29.112
Do you have any knowledge in all of this magic collection, the Mulholland thing, the guy that's saving the long guy or something?

16:29.227 --> 16:34.112
Oh, I only... I don't know what's happened.

16:34.152 --> 16:42.581
I only know Ricky Jay as a serious collector of magic and as a magician, and that he had a non-profit library going for acquisitions.

16:42.722 --> 16:47.587
It's always a little weird when a single person gets a non-profit status for any purpose.

16:47.667 --> 16:49.128
Maybe he's the curator of the Mulholland.

16:49.168 --> 16:52.852
Yes, I know that, but what the Mulholland library is is what I don't know.

16:53.593 --> 16:58.018
And now it's been threatened with dissolution for financial reasons,

16:58.302 --> 17:09.257
Or because whoever was the primary owner or donor, you know, is no longer sustaining it financially.

17:09.557 --> 17:11.160
Well, he was a savings and loan guy.

17:11.820 --> 17:13.282
I don't know anything about it.

17:13.583 --> 17:14.744
Okay.

17:15.526 --> 17:17.108
I've got that covered, no problem.

17:17.128 --> 17:17.889
I don't know anything.

17:17.989 --> 17:21.954
I only know of Ricky Jay by having him in front of my booth once every so often.

17:21.994 --> 17:22.535
Nice guy.

17:22.715 --> 17:23.036
Yeah.

17:23.697 --> 17:26.841
And like there's a magic man on each coast buying...

17:27.057 --> 17:36.606
religiously and faithfully buying books on magic, one in Canada, and the dealers are incredibly loyal to these worthy customers.

17:36.706 --> 17:54.263
And the fact that there's a larger entity involved meddling or making possible the creation of something which then is dissolved is simply a phenomenon that will occur in any financial sequence that comes down the pike.

17:54.513 --> 18:03.370
Libraries are built and libraries are dissolved, and some of the most important libraries are built and then, unbelievably to us, dissolved.

18:04.733 --> 18:10.884
Whereas, in fact, you know, libraries from time immemorial have been dissolved over and over and over again.

18:10.925 --> 18:13.770
So the fact that the Fort Summer Library is suddenly in Texas and...

18:14.189 --> 18:22.742
As a matter of fact, Texas is not beginning to get closer to deacquisitioning duplicates, something that has never happened before.

18:22.762 --> 18:24.725
They have duplicates?

18:24.765 --> 18:29.433
No, they've known all along that they have duplicates, and they've had no legal way to dispose of them.

18:29.513 --> 18:31.115
Well, the problem is it's a state.

18:31.255 --> 18:37.064
Well, I know the problem, but the fact is that they have someone there who's beginning to solve the problem.

18:37.305 --> 18:37.946
You're talking about Tom.

18:38.106 --> 18:38.326
Yeah.

18:38.887 --> 18:40.770
So...

18:42.100 --> 18:44.462
There's a problem, you know, that's going to get solved.

18:44.682 --> 18:46.384
Did you know Lou Feldman?

18:46.404 --> 18:46.884
I knew him.

18:47.124 --> 18:48.065
Can you tell me anything about him?

18:48.085 --> 18:49.126
Not much.

18:49.827 --> 18:51.568
Nobody liked Lou Feldman that I knew of.

18:53.450 --> 19:10.825
I once sold him a Beckett collection, and then because I had sold him a Beckett collection and subsequently gotten Waiting for Godot, one of 30, and had gotten that book signed by the confluence of events, I felt it my moral obligation to sell him that book also.

19:11.092 --> 19:23.313
even at cost, and I did that, and that was the last transaction we ever had, and I was not in any way involved with Feldman's supply in Texas.

19:23.894 --> 19:31.547
I came in as he was dying, and he simply wasn't in my constellation or I in here.

19:31.567 --> 19:32.949
Have you ever sold to Texas?

19:32.969 --> 19:33.370
Certainly.

19:34.071 --> 19:34.652
Any problems?

19:35.240 --> 19:39.204
No, I mean, Lou never had an exclusive with Texas.

19:39.224 --> 19:42.847
Lou was simply representing Texas at auction because he could financially carry Texas.

19:42.867 --> 19:50.954
Well, I've talked to dealers like Ken Rendell, who said that Warren Robbers, for instance, would say, look, we don't have time for all the dealers.

19:51.414 --> 19:54.037
Sell it to Lou Feldman, and we'll deal with Feldman.

19:54.057 --> 19:55.938
I never was ever referred to Feldman.

19:55.958 --> 19:59.842
There are many dealers who would have, you know, caused a tantrum.

19:59.902 --> 20:01.083
I would never have done that.

20:01.543 --> 20:03.525
Feldman was the main source.

20:04.450 --> 20:12.300
I don't recollect ever having had any trouble selling Texas things that I thought were warranted.

20:12.981 --> 20:13.541
I was a D.H.

20:13.582 --> 20:22.212
Lawrence person, as was Roberts, and I sold a binding collection to Beckett Turner, and I've already sold some things to Tom Staley.

20:22.293 --> 20:32.145
Texas, you know, was both in and out of, both directly and indirectly, may not have directly affected many dealers,

20:32.699 --> 20:40.609
But if something was aimed at Texas and it got there indirectly, or worthy of Texas, got there indirectly, we were the beneficiaries of it.

20:40.629 --> 20:42.631
But I had no trouble dealing with Texas directly.

20:43.152 --> 20:49.399
I'm fully aware of the advantages of indirection in the book trade and frequently participate in them.

20:49.580 --> 20:58.150
Everybody knows that I supply the University of California and Santa Cruz with Blake and Carlisle material of modest nature.

20:58.349 --> 21:07.060
and so it's very unlikely that they would buy them from someone else, since they have a limited budget, and I do a lot of things with Santa Cruz.

21:07.581 --> 21:27.066
So, but this kind of relationship is what makes the book business possible, and it happens either in ookensy-winksy degrees with places like Santa Cruz and myself, or it happens in economically monstrous and large situations, as with Roberts and Ransom in Texas and LDS.

21:27.526 --> 21:28.187
I think...

21:29.095 --> 21:53.854
Those will now be regarded as the dark ages in that responsible library administration would probably not allow one dealer to carry an enormous percentage of obligation and debt to the exclusion of other dealers, although that's the very phenomenon you see in Japan at the moment when every Japanese institution is represented by a

21:54.948 --> 21:56.811
Very small number of Japanese people.

21:56.851 --> 21:57.351
See, they did.

21:57.812 --> 22:00.696
They said I was on credit from Feldman.

22:00.716 --> 22:02.018
Well, they just didn't pay him.

22:02.899 --> 22:04.181
They've admitted it.

22:04.522 --> 22:05.423
But that's not a problem.

22:05.443 --> 22:11.892
They didn't pay him until they were able to pay him.

22:11.932 --> 22:17.100
But Cagle has been spending his budget ahead of time as long as I've known him, which is at least 20 years.

22:17.240 --> 22:20.685
And if you have to wait six months or eight months, it's understood.

22:21.121 --> 22:23.084
And that's simple.

22:23.144 --> 22:25.226
That's simply an administration.

22:25.246 --> 22:25.687
I'm not backing this.

22:25.707 --> 22:27.189
I think Feldman was willing to do this.

22:27.269 --> 22:30.073
Well, anybody would be willing to do it if they could afford to do it.

22:30.473 --> 22:32.776
I'm sure that Feldman discounted it all at the bank.

22:32.816 --> 22:35.500
Feldman was known to have personal assets via his wife.

22:35.520 --> 22:36.681
He probably had a line of credit.

22:37.402 --> 22:50.419
After 26 years, I have a line of credit of, I don't know, almost $500,000 so that if it comes to the management of funds and my willingness to do so, if somebody wanted me to carry them at interest for

22:50.635 --> 22:57.382
you know, a certain sum of money for a certain amount of time and he was good for it, I would be happy to do that.

22:58.823 --> 22:59.684
Not a problem.

22:59.824 --> 23:10.074
It's just, there's no question that in recent times, more booksellers are more adept at managing money.

23:11.055 --> 23:19.663
And managing money only leads them into the awareness, something that I certainly didn't have and that none of the people that I know are

23:20.065 --> 23:40.116
overly interested in getting to know more of, of leveraging their businesses slightly more than book businesses traditionally do, about which every other business in the United States or anywhere else in the world knows how to do inside and out, backwards and forwards, from time immemorial.

23:41.142 --> 23:45.567
The book business is surely the least leveraged of all so-called businesses.

23:45.907 --> 23:50.112
I'm sure that Heritage knows how to manipulate money.

23:50.292 --> 23:53.956
And Glenn, and I know about lines of credit.

23:54.737 --> 24:10.474
But the notion of a bookseller having a line of credit, my guess is that of the 500 and some members of the ABAA, not 75 operate their businesses utilizing

24:11.197 --> 24:19.786
a serious line of credit in the way that I think all English dealers universally do.

24:19.826 --> 24:22.309
They all have overdrafts.

24:22.329 --> 24:23.570
They call them overdrafts in England.

24:24.551 --> 24:34.582
I think I've never heard of an English dealer speak for an hour and not mention the size and extent of his overdraft, whereas in America it's a foreign concept.

24:34.602 --> 24:38.706
So the management of money is...

24:39.496 --> 24:44.020
It's probably, in this way, i.e.

24:44.180 --> 24:49.865
booksellers thinking about their businesses as businesses, financial entities.

24:49.885 --> 24:55.210
It's got to be, for the people that I know pretty well, i.e.

24:55.230 --> 25:02.276
modern perception of yours principally, a relatively new phenomenon.

25:03.317 --> 25:08.541
When I went to Heritage, or Novos, when I was on that way,

25:09.635 --> 25:19.606
Lou was showing me around this remodeled car with a stained glass window of me and his brother.

25:19.866 --> 25:23.290
Interesting place, I guess, and it's appropriate for the location.

25:24.191 --> 25:36.064
He took me into one room, the collection development room, and he told me of a customer, and this is typical, he said, of the type of customer that he had, who that morning

25:36.618 --> 25:41.244
and earlier morning that we could come in and say, well, I've been married for 21 years.

25:41.304 --> 25:42.806
Here's a list of 21 authors.

25:44.128 --> 25:48.494
And they gave him a code, 1L or 1H or something like that.

25:48.514 --> 25:53.280
And build a collection of these 21 different authors and deliver them.

25:53.520 --> 25:54.522
Price is no logic.

25:54.542 --> 25:56.424
And I said, well, is this book collecting?

25:56.444 --> 25:57.926
Or is this interior decoration?

25:58.006 --> 25:59.208
I mean, what are we doing here?

25:59.809 --> 26:02.192
And he said, you know what interior decorators make in Beverly Hills?

26:02.212 --> 26:04.034
I mean, he was shameless on the point.

26:04.094 --> 26:05.376
I mean, I guess I'm interested in

26:06.217 --> 26:09.342
I use that as an opening statement.

26:09.743 --> 26:11.245
Talk to me about this.

26:11.806 --> 26:30.537
Well, that particular example, that doesn't happen to the rest of us, and so it's very hard to... But the joy in collecting is to go out and... Well, I don't prescribe...

26:32.255 --> 26:34.618
There's nothing, I have no objection, I don't judge.

26:35.218 --> 26:40.264
I'm talking about the person who comes to him with that commission.

26:41.125 --> 26:43.548
All of us would welcome the commission.

26:43.568 --> 26:56.343
I think some of us with shame, some of us comes without shame, but I don't think there's any question that it would give us all a great pleasure to go to our colleagues and say, I need the 1-H of Conrad in fine condition.

26:56.443 --> 27:00.928
And so...

27:01.887 --> 27:16.084
None of us are surprised that Lou will get such commissions, and none of us are happy to supply the books, because they'll be back on the market, and some people would not bother to supply them, and others would, and that's no difference from anything else.

27:16.585 --> 27:27.017
The phenomenon itself, once you're healthy in any business, you tend to get healthier, so the fact that Heritage enjoys such easy business,

27:27.503 --> 27:29.747
and profitable, terribly profitable businesses.

27:30.027 --> 27:32.131
You know, nobody can begrudge them.

27:33.033 --> 27:36.078
That's wholly in character with the way he's always run his business.

27:37.120 --> 27:41.367
And the fact that loose cannon money is centered in L.A.

27:42.689 --> 27:46.095
results in the necessity that you also... Loose cannon money.

27:46.335 --> 27:50.743
Well, money that is so easily spent.

27:51.145 --> 27:55.832
Marsha Carter said, new money is happier money.

27:56.773 --> 28:00.399
He thinks that the action is out in the West Post on book action.

28:00.439 --> 28:05.166
Well, Larry said that it was Germans coming to buy books off his shelf in Washington, no one else.

28:08.230 --> 28:19.988
We, in Berkeley, don't necessarily enjoy the phenomenon of seeing that money roll off the hand of the customer into our pockets in that way, and so I have never had

28:20.322 --> 28:23.847
experiences like that, and yet I know that they occur all the time.

28:24.367 --> 28:26.811
No one has ever told me, you know, go get it.

28:27.852 --> 28:28.913
Price is no object.

28:28.973 --> 28:37.385
And get it in this, usually the item for which they want you to get price is no object is not easily gettable at any price.

28:37.445 --> 28:39.187
Sometimes it's pretty gettable, isn't it?

28:39.207 --> 28:40.288
Well, of course.

28:40.328 --> 28:49.080
The office he named were... It used to be called the carriage trade business, and you have to live where the carriage trade lives in order to have that business.

28:50.157 --> 28:56.106
And it enables Louie to support a vast number of relatives.

28:56.247 --> 29:01.355
And the way he runs it, he's certainly the most successful book dealer in the United States, I think.

29:01.395 --> 29:02.597
I asked him what his gross was.

29:02.637 --> 29:04.580
What do you think he said?

29:04.600 --> 29:05.602
Let me answer that question.

29:05.642 --> 29:07.164
I'll tell you what I think he said.

29:07.204 --> 29:09.027
I think he said...

29:14.373 --> 29:18.719
But the reason I bring it up is if I want to use it.

29:18.879 --> 29:24.707
It's interesting because I think he said... And I challenged what he said, too.

29:26.910 --> 29:28.512
Between $10 and $28 million a year.

29:28.532 --> 29:29.253
I said $5 million.

29:29.273 --> 29:30.435
$5 million a year.

29:30.455 --> 29:32.778
And I said that's impossible.

29:32.798 --> 29:33.419
I'm surprised.

29:33.559 --> 29:34.761
Well, it's always said $5 million.

29:35.321 --> 29:37.164
My gross last year was $1.6 million.

29:38.305 --> 29:43.873
And after five months of this year, my gross was $1.6 million.

29:45.068 --> 29:48.592
Although some people think it's realistic, but I have to believe it.

29:48.872 --> 29:49.512
You think it's more?

29:49.853 --> 29:50.553
I think it's more.

29:51.314 --> 29:52.576
No, I mean... It's not a lot of money.

29:52.596 --> 29:53.276
I mean, really.

29:53.296 --> 29:54.798
Oh, well, you're dead wrong there.

29:54.858 --> 29:55.518
Really?

29:55.619 --> 29:56.159
Absolutely.

29:56.580 --> 30:00.123
The guy's got a little voice in the parking lot there.

30:00.263 --> 30:01.064
You don't understand.

30:01.124 --> 30:02.205
Okay, I don't.

30:02.305 --> 30:02.886
Yeah, you don't.

30:03.026 --> 30:05.649
I mean, you don't understand.

30:07.430 --> 30:11.274
You just don't understand.

30:11.474 --> 30:15.058
At one point, he picked up a customer named Alan Fox.

30:15.713 --> 30:21.459
and Alan Fox wanted to buy, I think, textbooks and other things.

30:21.479 --> 30:26.904
And whatever the deal was, the deal was this, and Mark Twain.

30:29.467 --> 30:34.052
And I'm not privy to this deal, but Ron always reads these things from outside.

30:34.712 --> 30:42.881
The deal would be that they would walk around, and Lou would get him the best price possible, and he'd get a commission, 10%, 20%, probably 20%.

30:44.062 --> 30:45.163
Alan Fox spent two and a

30:45.582 --> 30:47.485
$3 million in a very short period of time.

30:48.527 --> 30:51.271
Very short.

30:51.291 --> 30:54.877
Alan Fox is a real estate person.

30:54.897 --> 30:56.399
L.A.?

30:56.459 --> 30:56.599
Yes.

30:56.619 --> 30:58.863
Alan, A-L-O-E-N?

30:58.883 --> 31:00.826
Yes.

31:00.846 --> 31:09.700
And in exchange for these services, he helped Lou learn a bit of the real estate business and recommended properties to him.

31:11.350 --> 31:14.354
I believe it began with a single collection, the Unger sale.

31:14.774 --> 31:18.159
Lou got the Unger books from the widow Unger in New Jersey.

31:18.379 --> 31:24.267
He got them for, let's call it $50,000 or so.

31:26.770 --> 31:29.033
Other people were competing for the books.

31:29.053 --> 31:33.579
Lou is very skilled to question.

31:33.599 --> 31:40.868
And he sold them to Maurice F. Neville just as Maurice was entering the book business with a seven inherited million dollar.

31:41.607 --> 31:42.888
for, I believe, $175,000.

31:43.049 --> 31:48.574
In cash or otherwise.

31:49.555 --> 31:54.441
He made a very quick $100,000 profit quite a way back.

31:55.582 --> 32:02.609
And about this time, he met Alan Fox, who taught him the real estate business.

32:02.709 --> 32:05.352
And he almost surely taught him how to leverage real estate.

32:06.053 --> 32:10.838
And without a doubt, Lou Weinstein took profits

32:11.493 --> 32:17.422
and invested them in real estate, principally apartment houses in Los Angeles.

32:17.442 --> 32:18.524
It's a hotel in New York.

32:18.584 --> 32:23.992
And a ground rent in a hotel in New York.

32:24.012 --> 32:38.715
And I'm absolutely certain that Lou's income, that Lou is worth many millions on the basis of his real estate, which in turn guarantees and finances a leverage book business.

32:40.872 --> 33:05.631
complicated by very strong relationships with the Japanese, to which he has been pumping vast quantities of books, I believe, at ever higher levels, together with an amalgamation of resources, assets, intelligence, and muscle, with David Brass of E. Joseph in London, a similarly financed person,

33:08.092 --> 33:21.892
together probably with a lesser relationship with Jim Cummins, who's a gentler person than these other two, and a better book person, but principally with David Brass.

33:22.293 --> 33:35.432
So that Heritage and David Brass, E. Joseph, and Heritage, as partners in innumerable deals with Japan as a major

33:35.733 --> 34:02.230
customer with the carriage trade in both cities as major cash flow providers are extremely powerful aggressive booksellers moving back and forth and here and there a large quantity of known books known for their reliability known for their market value known for their fixed price

34:03.205 --> 34:11.495
known for their lasting desirability, and so they broker vast quantities of books.

34:12.576 --> 34:22.308
But the fact is that they don't affect other booksellers' lives necessarily, either negatively or positively.

34:22.348 --> 34:26.833
They, as often as not, call me up for a given book, and I almost never have it.

34:27.185 --> 34:31.571
If they're asking for specific books, I will quote them because I know that they're serious.

34:31.591 --> 34:32.272
They have customers.

34:32.372 --> 34:32.913
They're not frivolous.

34:32.933 --> 34:34.415
They're not looking for bargains.

34:35.156 --> 34:35.696
They're out there.

34:35.716 --> 34:36.217
They need the books.

34:36.277 --> 34:39.522
They have customers.

34:39.542 --> 34:42.185
These guys have customers, either implied or real.

34:43.667 --> 34:52.539
And having customers is not the norm in the book.

34:53.180 --> 34:54.762
Having customers is not the norm.

34:55.332 --> 35:17.978
But if you are well-capitalized, bright, experienced, and are in major world capitals, and I've also gone to explore ahead of other people, as Lou did in Japan, new markets, then you have every factor that guarantees success and increased success.

35:17.998 --> 35:23.044
So that when the greatest books begin to show up more and more at

35:23.362 --> 35:33.713
at places where the margins are thinner and thinner, namely at auction, the people most likely to acquire them are people like E. Joseph and David Bratt.

35:33.793 --> 35:35.214
And so they do.

35:36.215 --> 35:37.817
And if you check it out, so they have.

35:40.139 --> 35:52.812
The miracle is that Gary and Franny can sell 400,000 and you don't hear the phone ringing.

35:53.230 --> 36:05.984
And then I can sell $1.6 million, which turns into like $5,000 a day, when I can easily remember looking for my first $100 sale, easily remember it.

36:07.506 --> 36:22.562
And if you get my financial history printout, you know, I made 3 or 4% of my gross as net profit year after year after year, and it was 15 years before I made $16,000, and so on.

36:22.812 --> 36:27.259
financial growth and success of booksellers wildly varies.

36:28.781 --> 36:34.770
But there are only a couple people like Heritage and Horowitz and there's only one of me.

36:34.790 --> 36:45.426
And Gary and Franny in financial terms are way, way, way ahead of all the rest of the world combined.

36:46.307 --> 36:49.512
And then there's the great...

36:50.183 --> 36:59.916
Massive booksellers in my revere are out there working away, doing the best they can, not necessarily motivated by money or whatever, enjoying modest livings.

37:00.056 --> 37:06.865
Heritage is an extraordinary example of a successful businessman who happens to be in books.

37:06.885 --> 37:12.052
You have somebody like Priscilla Duvelis who works out of her apartment because you know Priscilla in Boston.

37:12.072 --> 37:12.353
Sure.

37:13.995 --> 37:19.523
She doesn't have an open shop, you know.

37:19.603 --> 37:19.903
Right.

37:20.103 --> 37:21.505
Priscilla has access to money.

37:22.306 --> 37:26.111
Access to cash and deals in certain kinds of things that are expensive.

37:29.736 --> 37:34.603
How many of them at any one time with however many people is her affair.

37:34.623 --> 37:35.705
I have 300,000 books.

37:35.845 --> 37:39.410
And I know them all.

37:39.650 --> 37:40.431
I mean, more or less.

37:40.692 --> 37:44.217
The niece of the man up in Portland.

37:45.238 --> 37:46.239
Do you think I could give her a call?

37:46.480 --> 37:47.301
There would be no point in that.

37:47.321 --> 37:48.102
That would be a mistake.

37:48.841 --> 37:51.424
Go talk to Charlie Selyazicki about Fred.

37:51.684 --> 37:51.944
Okay.

37:52.545 --> 37:53.706
Selyazicki you should talk to.

37:53.807 --> 37:55.308
Bob is hard to get a hold of.

37:55.689 --> 37:57.551
Selyazicki was a close friend of Fred's.

37:57.571 --> 37:59.173
He was a beneficiary of the library.

37:59.193 --> 38:00.714
He was a bookseller.

38:01.075 --> 38:03.177
He's a wonderful, gentle book.

38:03.197 --> 38:06.000
3733 Northeast 24th.

38:06.541 --> 38:07.001
Portland?

38:07.382 --> 38:09.344
Northeast.

38:09.364 --> 38:09.584
Got you.

38:10.525 --> 38:11.266
3733 24th.

38:11.326 --> 38:11.526
3723.

38:11.547 --> 38:12.928
3733.

38:13.048 --> 38:16.452
And what's the name of the store?

38:16.837 --> 38:17.999
Charles Saucicchi.

38:18.039 --> 38:18.880
He uses his name.

38:20.983 --> 38:21.364
That's a tough one.

38:21.384 --> 38:23.948
And then you were going to tell me something about Toby Holtzman.

38:24.829 --> 38:31.018
Toby Holtzman was a guy who cared, is a guy who cared.

38:31.038 --> 38:32.440
H-O-L-T-Z-M-A-N?

38:32.481 --> 38:32.901
Yes.

38:32.921 --> 38:34.143
New Yorker, California?

38:35.485 --> 38:39.351
His home is in Grosse Pointe Farm, Michigan, and he is a builder.

38:39.411 --> 38:42.135
The firm is

38:42.520 --> 38:45.603
The business is pretty much in his son's hands now.

38:45.623 --> 38:47.425
The firm is Holtzman and Silberman.

38:49.608 --> 38:56.836
They're builders of dwellings, thousands of units.

38:57.757 --> 39:03.904
Silberman is the biggest collector in the world of fluxus art, as it happens, fluxus art.

39:05.005 --> 39:08.489
Holtzman, I don't know how it ever got started.

39:08.509 --> 39:09.370
His father was a builder.

39:09.390 --> 39:10.671
His father started the firm.

39:11.174 --> 39:16.299
He's clearly a millionaire, multimillionaire, very successful.

39:16.700 --> 39:20.684
His sons are even more aggressive than me, and he's plenty aggressive.

39:21.184 --> 39:21.985
He's very wise.

39:23.887 --> 39:26.309
But for some reason, he cared about books.

39:27.411 --> 39:38.582
He collected American writers who were born after he was born and poets he met.

39:41.785 --> 39:44.428
And he collected, he attempted to buy the books.

39:44.448 --> 39:55.438
He had much in common with Fred Jacobson in a way, but he was controlled more by principle than by commitment to the text of the individual book.

39:56.159 --> 39:58.521
He believed in a nation's writing.

39:59.142 --> 40:02.485
He believed in collecting the first edition and every important edition.

40:03.726 --> 40:07.590
He believed in collecting a token letter or manuscript.

40:08.498 --> 40:11.841
He believed in collecting contributions to books and contributions to periodicals.

40:11.862 --> 40:14.825
He believed that the whole was more than the individual sum of the parts.

40:14.865 --> 40:18.629
He believed that an author's work was more important than a single author's important book.

40:19.970 --> 40:21.411
He believed in collecting a fine condition.

40:21.431 --> 40:23.694
He believed in buying the books new when they were published.

40:26.156 --> 40:30.581
He collected known authors.

40:30.601 --> 40:31.562
And he was systematic.

40:31.782 --> 40:33.945
He did not believe in paying too much for a book.

40:33.965 --> 40:38.269
He did not believe in going back and getting something that he missed at a

40:38.620 --> 40:39.962
significantly higher price.

40:41.564 --> 40:44.769
But he did believe in getting them when they came out, and he clipped PW.

40:44.809 --> 40:45.950
He read PW.

40:45.991 --> 40:48.154
He's the only book collector I ever know that read PW.

40:48.174 --> 40:50.737
He clipped PW.

40:50.757 --> 40:57.667
He would pay any sum of money to travel around the world to get the books, but he wouldn't then pay too much for the book.

40:58.609 --> 41:00.031
He was on the committee for the book.

41:00.051 --> 41:04.577
He is a volunteer to the committee on the book in the Library of Congress.

41:04.827 --> 41:06.068
a religious Faulkner collector.

41:06.088 --> 41:07.930
He would constantly go down to the Faulkner conference.

41:07.950 --> 41:12.315
He was mobile, an essential element in the book.

41:12.335 --> 41:14.397
Well, mobility is so much more important than money.

41:15.138 --> 41:15.618
It's just unpeakable.

41:18.461 --> 41:20.343
Single intelligence and then mobility.

41:25.068 --> 41:34.058
And Toby collected maybe 200 American prose writers, and then one day he sold them.

41:34.291 --> 41:35.553
It's all in the mean.

41:36.894 --> 41:41.320
Can you explain why he used that?

41:41.340 --> 41:44.744
I am interested in the author of Houghton Syndrome.

41:44.765 --> 41:49.110
He lost interest when the authors died, and he moved them up.

41:49.130 --> 41:51.253
He actually physically moved them across the room when they died.

41:51.293 --> 41:52.254
They filled his house.

41:53.015 --> 41:56.840
I think, one, he finished collecting all the authors.

41:56.920 --> 41:58.863
As he grew older, his authors grew older, they stopped.

41:59.383 --> 42:01.446
He had less enthusiasm for the younger authors.

42:02.101 --> 42:05.165
To what degree Toby read is unclear to me.

42:05.566 --> 42:07.328
What he did do was to see stage plays.

42:07.348 --> 42:08.990
He would see every stage play in New York.

42:09.010 --> 42:11.093
He'd watch the blind stage plays.

42:11.113 --> 42:13.937
So he'd collect the drama as well, something that many people don't collect.

42:14.438 --> 42:19.605
People, they all collect prose, and then to what extent they collect drama and poetry.

42:19.765 --> 42:22.829
As print books or as manuscript?

42:22.909 --> 42:25.032
No, no, not manuscript.

42:25.052 --> 42:26.153
Nobody collects them.

42:26.173 --> 42:30.319
Well, Carter Burden claims to have 50 unpublished Tennessee Williams items.

42:31.295 --> 42:32.376
Well, that's easily done.

42:33.638 --> 42:37.142
They could be... Well, they would be play scripts.

42:37.182 --> 42:40.527
They'd be what I specialize in, scripts.

42:40.547 --> 42:45.553
Mimeograph scripts of things that were not published, just like film scripts are not published.

42:46.214 --> 42:47.936
So I can understand that.

42:47.956 --> 42:50.539
Probably many of them came from me.

42:50.579 --> 42:55.606
I mean, I supplied it with Tennessee Williams' first play, written in college, 1933.

42:55.646 --> 42:57.488
Tennessee Williams, to me, is...

42:58.042 --> 42:59.304
Well, you should see me.

42:59.404 --> 43:02.868
I am suddenly rich with, I have lots of tons of land.

43:02.888 --> 43:05.592
I have serious, what?

43:05.792 --> 43:06.673
I think I have all of them.

43:06.693 --> 43:07.755
No, you don't.

43:07.775 --> 43:08.496
I don't?

43:08.556 --> 43:08.736
No.

43:09.797 --> 43:10.558
What don't I have?

43:10.618 --> 43:11.399
I don't know which I have.

43:11.439 --> 43:15.685
I'll send you a list of what exists and then you can tell me what you don't have.

43:15.705 --> 43:17.687
You don't believe me, though.

43:19.310 --> 43:22.193
Toby started collecting two other things.

43:22.233 --> 43:25.838
He started collecting Soviet literature and Pasternak.

43:27.877 --> 43:29.159
And he started going to Russia.

43:30.461 --> 43:31.602
I said, wonderful.

43:31.983 --> 43:42.478
And he has only recently imported a person to Stanford for an exhibit and paid all his expenses, bought him clothes because his suitcase didn't arrive to work.

43:42.538 --> 43:46.684
And in exchange, he's gotten from this person some inscribed Isaac Babel.

43:48.607 --> 43:49.588
So he's collecting there.

43:49.608 --> 43:55.116
He's collecting Soviet literature in English and some in Russian.

43:55.349 --> 43:58.453
And in this regard, he's... And it is Soviet, it's not just... Soviet.

43:58.793 --> 43:59.234
Soviet.

43:59.254 --> 44:01.056
There are four people he collects pre-Soviet.

44:01.797 --> 44:05.122
It was centered in Pasternak, and he has a fine Pasternak collection.

44:05.222 --> 44:10.849
I have gotten him some wonderful Pasternak, and I don't read a word of Russian, but I have gotten him some great Pasternak.

44:11.670 --> 44:12.231
Truly great.

44:12.892 --> 44:16.917
And... Truly great meeting manuscripts, that kind of thing.

44:16.937 --> 44:19.580
One Samusat book of poems, yes.

44:19.640 --> 44:21.202
And some inscribed Pasternak.

44:21.222 --> 44:22.824
Lots of inscribed Pasternak.

44:22.845 --> 44:24.006
And he's gotten a lot on his own.

44:25.302 --> 44:46.749
But, because he believes that the way that, you know, cultures are best represented in their literature, that was his attitude toward American literature, and he believes in these, he's taken his Faulkner collection to Moscow, or a part of it, and exhibited it, and done a catalog of Sholokov and Passamak in parallel sequence to show, you know, the... Did he track anything?

44:46.769 --> 44:47.190
Oh, sure.

44:48.872 --> 44:51.876
But, I'd give you all these things.

44:52.256 --> 44:53.638
But what he has really done,

44:54.698 --> 45:23.676
toby's a jew he's a clearly a jew what he's his great collection greater than his american books were disseminated i bought them all i still have many of them but you know why did he say why he was dissolving indifference no not indifference no give them a new life something like that it's just that you know he had done what he wanted to do with them and they had done for him what he needed and toby is a practical and a realist and and he

45:25.580 --> 45:28.563
And he knew that they were not unique beyond the belief.

45:28.623 --> 45:33.968
And he didn't allow his emotions to be inside those book covers.

45:34.068 --> 45:37.071
He's a more independent, stronger man.

45:37.111 --> 45:38.593
That's the wrong word.

45:39.013 --> 45:40.235
He's not dependent on the books.

45:40.415 --> 45:41.696
He's not dependent on the books.

45:41.716 --> 45:42.957
Is his name actually Toby?

45:43.718 --> 45:46.481
Erwin T. Holtzman.

45:46.501 --> 45:52.887
But what Toby really did, this experience of collecting American authors, which wasn't so hard,

45:54.723 --> 45:56.525
enabled him to get another vision.

45:57.026 --> 46:02.792
And he started collecting Israelis' authors, Israel's authors.

46:02.812 --> 46:11.301
And he has collected all of Israel's authors in all of their languages, five languages, and plus all of their manuscripts, as best he can do.

46:11.702 --> 46:13.163
He has gone to Israel numerous times.

46:13.203 --> 46:18.549
He's patronized numerous Israeli authors, genuinely patronized them.

46:18.749 --> 46:20.331
You mean in a classic sense?

46:20.371 --> 46:20.591
Yes.

46:21.052 --> 46:24.055
And he has built

46:24.693 --> 46:33.783
tucked away in Crows Point Farms, Michigan, what I believe to be the greatest collection of Israel's literature in the world, better than in Israel.

46:34.283 --> 46:36.025
And it's his intention to give it to Israel.

46:36.145 --> 46:37.026
I've got to talk to him.

46:38.768 --> 46:43.233
This is the thrust of my book.

46:43.393 --> 46:48.739
It is his intention to give it to Israel, I believe.

46:48.839 --> 46:51.342
That one will stay together.

46:51.541 --> 46:53.203
Even if it doesn't go to Israel.

46:53.223 --> 46:54.184
It might go to Stanford.

46:55.265 --> 46:58.109
He just exhibited his passion acts at Stanford.

46:58.649 --> 47:05.798
And Sanford was, you know, Toby is willing to spend money on everything but the individual book.

47:05.818 --> 47:09.642
He won't pay too much for the book, but he'll fly a Russian in with some books in his pockets.

47:09.702 --> 47:10.663
He will fly to Russia.

47:10.683 --> 47:11.444
He'll go to Israel.

47:11.985 --> 47:13.847
And mind you, he doesn't go second class.

47:14.448 --> 47:17.211
So in terms, he has a stupendous,

47:18.642 --> 47:25.853
collection of Israeli literature in all languages, and only have two dealers and himself doing it.

47:27.355 --> 47:31.681
And it is the idea of it which is compelling to Toby.

47:31.722 --> 47:42.217
He is absolutely convinced that the preservation of a literature in its entirety together in the unit, he gave his Faulkner collection to Michigan, minus the top 15 items.

47:42.237 --> 47:43.459
15?

47:43.479 --> 47:44.240
15.

47:45.522 --> 47:45.763
Why?

47:46.263 --> 47:47.044
Why 15?

47:47.064 --> 47:48.126
The economics of it.

47:49.237 --> 47:51.700
I was involved in that.

47:52.461 --> 47:57.106
But his terms to Michigan were that they must be kept physically together.

47:57.126 --> 48:02.351
Now, no library will accept those terms, but Michigan did.

48:02.371 --> 48:08.638
Well, it's in its own room somewhere.

48:09.079 --> 48:12.142
It's in its own room.

48:14.545 --> 48:17.488
His terms were that it stayed together, so it stayed together.

48:18.110 --> 48:20.393
minus its top 15 items, which I sold for them.

48:21.995 --> 48:24.358
Most libraries cannot keep books together that way.

48:24.378 --> 48:25.800
That's not the way libraries work.

48:25.820 --> 48:27.622
Some of them will do it.

48:27.642 --> 48:28.743
No, some of them will not do it.

48:29.244 --> 48:29.765
You're wrong.

48:30.005 --> 48:31.046
They won't do it.

48:31.948 --> 48:33.349
But Michigan did do it.

48:33.810 --> 48:34.771
So they got the books.

48:35.552 --> 48:36.934
He tried to give them to the Library of Congress.

48:36.974 --> 48:38.456
I mean, he didn't get any response.

48:39.477 --> 48:41.780
He couldn't give them to the Library of Congress on those terms.

48:42.060 --> 48:45.805
Well, they kept the Rosenwald collection together, didn't they?

48:46.628 --> 48:51.075
Then Toby, but you don't see the problems are multiple.

48:51.115 --> 48:59.848
Toby then has said to me, I will buy any critical book from Peterson's collection and give it to Michigan.

48:59.868 --> 49:01.030
I'll give them any one they don't have.

49:01.290 --> 49:01.971
So I said, fine.

49:01.991 --> 49:09.543
I wrote Michigan, sent them the catalog saying, please indicate which critical books you don't have so that Toby Holson can buy and give them to you.

49:10.745 --> 49:10.985
Right?

49:11.286 --> 49:11.826
No response.

49:12.167 --> 49:12.748
Jesus Christ.

49:12.768 --> 49:13.429
Are they crazy?

49:14.050 --> 49:14.951
No response.

49:14.971 --> 49:15.572
What's wrong with them?

49:18.691 --> 49:22.977
You've got to understand that it costs the library money to give them a book.

49:24.919 --> 49:25.460
Twenty dollars.

49:25.801 --> 49:28.564
You give them a thousand books, it costs them twenty thousand dollars.

49:28.584 --> 49:29.666
You're not doing them any favors.

49:29.686 --> 49:32.990
Somebody said this to me before.

49:33.010 --> 49:36.055
Simply processing them, acquisition them, cataloging them.

49:36.195 --> 49:37.677
It costs twenty dollars a book.

49:37.697 --> 49:38.498
It probably costs more.

49:38.818 --> 49:46.048
You still had to... Did you pick up the phone and say... Well, they don't have a special collections librarian.

49:47.142 --> 49:48.504
They don't have staff to search.

49:48.524 --> 49:49.425
They don't have this, don't have that.

49:49.445 --> 49:49.946
Who knows?

49:50.246 --> 49:50.947
Do you believe that?

49:51.428 --> 49:51.728
Sure.

49:51.768 --> 49:53.951
The Clements Library?

49:53.991 --> 49:55.994
Well, I don't know about the Clements Library.

49:56.355 --> 49:58.778
They got people up to the other units.

49:58.798 --> 49:59.639
Not necessarily.

49:59.679 --> 50:01.221
Not necessarily.

50:01.241 --> 50:09.032
The Ohio State is the designated library or self-designated library to collect

50:09.974 --> 50:13.780
and to make possible a bibliography of American literature, American fiction, 1901, 1925.

50:14.802 --> 50:18.088
There are already bibliographies of American fiction to 1900.

50:18.288 --> 50:21.894
It's called Write One, Write Two, and Write Three, published by the Huntington.

50:21.914 --> 50:26.902
They're classic checklists of American fiction from the beginning to 1900.

50:26.922 --> 50:30.608
The next section is 1901, 1925.

50:30.789 --> 50:32.852
Ohio State is the repository.

50:33.433 --> 50:34.615
They have been funded.

50:35.455 --> 50:37.738
administratively to continue the project.

50:37.758 --> 50:39.260
I'm the single largest supplier.

50:39.280 --> 50:44.386
I have organized the whole United States to collect fiction that Ohio State does not have.

50:44.887 --> 50:51.835
There's some 20,000 to 30,000 volumes in this, potentially, and they have, I don't know how many, they have 13 or 14 or 15,000.

50:51.875 --> 50:53.537
They think there's only plenty.

50:53.577 --> 50:54.438
I think there's probably more.

50:54.619 --> 50:57.262
What should I talk to in Ohio State?

50:57.402 --> 51:02.188
Jeffrey Smith with a G. But, and I've sold

51:02.472 --> 51:07.338
I sold Ohio State $50,000 worth of $20 books, $30 books in this period.

51:08.139 --> 51:11.984
It's a lot of books in a very short period of time.

51:12.705 --> 51:25.482
But at the present moment and for the immediate future, they do not have one dime for buying books in this field, although they have several hundreds of thousands of dollars for administrating the mechanics of it.

51:25.502 --> 51:26.724
They don't have anything for acquisition.

51:27.064 --> 51:28.446
This is often the case.

51:28.983 --> 51:56.678
either either either they have money for acquisition and not for administration or they have money for uh administration not acquisition the university of texas could spend all its money into eternity for the preservation of that which it already has in terms of conservation and preservation or a substantial amount of it university california's budgets across the board were cut 12 percent the financial implications of collecting

51:59.003 --> 52:09.094
I mean, I'm sure Carter was looking at the ultimate like, you know, there is no limit to how much money I can spend in 20th century books, and this is just 20th century books.

52:09.854 --> 52:18.663
The least significant of all books, since, you know, other books being older and less accessible are more important because they're less available.

52:18.684 --> 52:20.746
You can always get a 20th century book.

52:20.806 --> 52:22.708
As Carter found out, he could get them all in 10 years.

52:22.748 --> 52:23.949
He got them all.

52:24.570 --> 52:25.691
William Crow Swings has them all.

52:26.111 --> 52:27.933
Walker has them all.

52:27.953 --> 52:28.774
And fine copies.

52:29.648 --> 52:30.769
Name an author, has them all.

52:31.029 --> 52:32.250
There are no gaps.

52:32.270 --> 52:33.191
Has them all.

52:35.173 --> 52:35.553
What do you do?

52:35.573 --> 52:40.458
Well, then you go to minor and more and more and more minor writers.

52:40.478 --> 52:45.622
But he was unwilling to go down to the level that in poetry one person has gone down to.

52:45.662 --> 52:57.473
There is one dealer and one collector of American poetry who's buying one each of every book of American poetry, so long as it was a serious attempt at poetry, not a vanity book.

52:57.493 --> 52:58.474
In other words, I am New York.

52:59.095 --> 53:02.219
Oh, no, this is Henry Moore's nephew.

53:03.681 --> 53:07.246
And the dealer is tucked away in Quilo, California.

53:08.548 --> 53:09.669
He's well-known.

53:09.689 --> 53:12.633
He's also buying an Australian... Who's the collector?

53:12.733 --> 53:13.695
His name is Donowski.

53:15.978 --> 53:17.359
D-A-N-O-W-S-P-Y.

53:17.480 --> 53:19.182
Donowski.

53:19.242 --> 53:20.283
He has one D-A-N-O-W-S-P-Y.

53:20.303 --> 53:22.046
He has one D-A-N-O-W-S-P-Y.

53:22.066 --> 53:24.529
But the goal is one each of our old books of analysis.

53:24.830 --> 53:29.216
It was always one each of English, American poetry, Australian poetry, Canadian poetry, i.e.

53:29.577 --> 53:31.660
poetry in English language.

53:31.680 --> 53:32.001
One each.

53:32.461 --> 53:36.207
Down to the mimeograph.

53:36.227 --> 53:37.829
What's the source of this practice as well?

53:38.330 --> 53:39.291
Henry Moore.

53:39.311 --> 53:41.535
Henry Moore, you said that.

53:41.555 --> 53:42.536
And he's in California?

53:42.596 --> 53:42.817
No.

53:44.018 --> 53:44.639
That's right.

53:44.659 --> 53:46.402
And I don't need it.

53:46.422 --> 53:53.352
The point is that whereas Carter collected known American poets, known poets,

53:53.973 --> 53:54.293
i.e.

53:54.354 --> 53:56.957
ports that you would automatically find in every library.

53:58.219 --> 54:02.264
This collector is collecting all of American ports.

54:02.284 --> 54:03.105
Do you think it's reachable?

54:03.446 --> 54:04.728
Are you going to get it?

54:04.748 --> 54:05.108
He hasn't.

54:05.569 --> 54:06.250
He hasn't.

54:06.270 --> 54:07.251
I mean, there's always more.

54:07.351 --> 54:09.594
You see, the wonderful thing about books is that there is always more.

54:09.654 --> 54:16.724
The other thing that happens is that one day he dies, it's all in boxes in the Swiss warehouse.

54:17.485 --> 54:20.689
One day, should he die and the heirs not care?

54:20.888 --> 54:34.729
the formulas for constructing a self-memorializing building and so on, if they're not completed or whatnot, poof, back in the market, you know, will be 200,000 volumes of poetry or a million volumes.

54:34.749 --> 54:35.750
This guy was all in Switzerland?

54:35.830 --> 54:36.151
Yeah.

54:36.231 --> 54:37.553
Danowski lives in Switzerland.

54:37.573 --> 54:37.733
Yeah.

54:39.175 --> 54:42.300
Do you know Danowski's first name?

54:42.320 --> 54:46.146
I'll be very discreet, don't worry about this.

54:46.166 --> 54:46.767
I'm just curious.

54:47.368 --> 54:47.588
But...

54:48.530 --> 54:51.234
It's not in my head at the moment.

54:54.079 --> 54:54.179
Okay.

54:54.199 --> 55:02.312
These are only illustrations to a point, really, that, you know, where Carter stopped, actually, someone else was going on, and is still going on, and spending lots of money.

55:02.372 --> 55:06.338
It's yet fathomable amounts of money.

55:06.358 --> 55:08.842
So he spends a million a year or so, you know.

55:08.862 --> 55:09.142
Nothing.

55:09.162 --> 55:09.443
Right.

55:10.124 --> 55:10.424
Right.

55:10.745 --> 55:11.266
No, it's nothing.

55:11.286 --> 55:11.786
It's nothing.

55:12.087 --> 55:15.432
We're a bunch of pikers, and we control the culture, the physical...

55:15.901 --> 55:17.643
representation of the culture of the world.

55:17.863 --> 55:20.006
Listen, I'm going to Christie's Friday morning.

55:20.146 --> 55:23.310
And they will spend more there than the modern precision books.

55:23.330 --> 55:26.433
This binding collection, the Chevalier collection, you know.

55:26.834 --> 55:28.216
I don't know, but that's all right.

55:28.236 --> 55:29.397
Well, it's binding, you know.

55:29.677 --> 55:30.118
I understand.

55:30.358 --> 55:31.920
Content is irrelevant.

55:31.940 --> 55:32.220
Right.

55:32.361 --> 55:36.105
The money they're going to spend for these goddamn bindings is going to be staggering.

55:36.125 --> 55:37.346
That's right.

55:37.366 --> 55:39.229
Well, it's simply another art form.

55:39.429 --> 55:44.575
It's not to be denied the moment you... But the point is, we've got about a million dollars for books.

55:45.196 --> 55:47.539
in the grand scheme of things, it's no big deal.

55:47.559 --> 55:47.779
Right.

55:47.839 --> 55:56.448
The trick is that you don't want to spend $10,000 for a book, and it's Manny's Greatest Fear, that somebody tomorrow has for $4,000.

55:56.528 --> 56:05.639
You know, in the piece I'm writing for the Times, I'm going to make it very clear that the whole Haber No More thing went for 16 mil, okay?

56:05.719 --> 56:09.202
And this was 315 extraordinary high spots, all right?

56:09.523 --> 56:13.347
The night before this sale, a Japanese

56:13.597 --> 56:17.543
$22 million for a de Kumi, a living artist.

56:17.563 --> 56:18.865
Right.

56:20.167 --> 56:37.933
All of us are aware of the anomalies in this world, but the fact is that the moment you try to leap from one to the other, and this is only from personal experience, the only times in which you make the

56:38.268 --> 56:44.095
leap, you try to be part of that world, when you're in this world, it doesn't really work.

56:44.575 --> 57:01.995
Carter was, had collected paintings, of course, modern paintings, and he would, and he sold, had sold modern paintings, and he made, right, and he sells three modern paintings and enables him to collect, you know, a room full of books.

57:02.515 --> 57:07.701
He made a vast profit on the paintings, he didn't make vast profit on the books, because

57:08.069 --> 57:17.818
The rules of the game prevent him from making vast... And they're not really... So these kinds of activity are not really comparable.

57:19.360 --> 57:36.996
Compared to the number of individual books that are sold, or the fact that they're printed in more than one copy, prevents any grandiose behavior in terms of dollars, generally speaking, until you get back to those things that do command serious amounts of money.

57:37.178 --> 57:58.309
namely these illuminating manuscripts and great monuments or unique things and things that are unique and and interesting or beautiful and so on and and so but the fact is that uh you know first folios people can still own first folios uh they're getting harder to get quickly good ones but uh

57:58.728 --> 58:00.109
But there are rarer books.

58:00.169 --> 58:06.556
I mean, there are, of the thousand printed, there's, you know, 700 are accounted for, so that... The Revival is not a scarce book.

58:06.576 --> 58:12.622
Well, to get one, it's a scarce book de facto, because you can't get one.

58:12.862 --> 58:16.886
There's only one privately owned Gutenberg left, I believe, which would be Shinty's.

58:18.388 --> 58:23.413
The fact is that you can't get one, so that makes it, from your point of view, a very scarce book.

58:23.433 --> 58:24.634
But you can get books...

58:24.732 --> 58:30.338
Well, I handle the Blickling homilies at Shaggy's Library, which is quite a kick.

58:31.720 --> 58:32.401
Exceedingly snuff.

58:32.421 --> 58:36.606
That's a scarce book.

58:36.626 --> 58:43.213
Most of us, we ought not to have to endure pain and suffering when we come up with the modern equivalent of this kind of thing.

58:43.794 --> 58:50.582
And yet, I mean, I just got through the offices of my good friend in Southern California.

58:50.602 --> 58:54.486
William Faulkner's first

58:54.787 --> 59:10.552
screen credit was a film of Turnabout and I have the script and it's the file copy of the studio and I have the story that Turnabout typed up by the studio for the purposes and it's for which he got his first film credit.

59:10.572 --> 59:18.906
It's a wonderful author item and I'm going to get nothing but trouble when I try to sell it to Richard Manning.

59:19.246 --> 59:20.028
Nothing but trouble.

59:20.068 --> 59:21.570
Instead of getting nothing but thanks

59:21.753 --> 59:23.215
I'm going to get nothing but trouble.

59:23.275 --> 59:24.177
That goes with the territory.

59:24.797 --> 59:26.460
But why are you going to offer it to him first then?

59:26.760 --> 59:28.963
Because he has bought my other Faulkner screenplays.

59:31.868 --> 59:39.919
Because he has systematically been willing to buy my other Faulkner screenplays.

59:40.039 --> 59:43.204
And he deserves first refusal on it.
