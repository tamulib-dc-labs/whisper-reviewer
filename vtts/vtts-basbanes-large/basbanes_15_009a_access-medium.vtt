00:02.360 --> 00:17.554
because clearly you are concerned in your writing and in your comments about the relationship between the author and the reader.

00:17.574 --> 00:18.917
And it's very clear...

00:19.640 --> 00:27.473
concern here in this book.

00:27.493 --> 00:34.666
I don't know if we could just open the conversation that way, but if you could just tell me a little bit about this concern for the reader here.

00:34.686 --> 00:35.387
Well, first of all, I don't want...

00:37.156 --> 00:41.302
I don't want the reader to get away too easily.

00:41.323 --> 00:54.784
I think that reading and writing present a really unique opportunity that the other arts don't.

00:54.804 --> 00:55.705
I envy the musician.

00:56.343 --> 01:02.110
I envy the dancer, the physicality of the dancer, the immediacy of music.

01:02.210 --> 01:09.840
And those are models that I try to imitate with the rhythm, speech rhythms, rhythm of the prose, the words.

01:10.601 --> 01:15.808
But really, writing and reading has something unique about it.

01:15.828 --> 01:19.212
It can't be duplicated by the other mediums, media.

01:19.192 --> 01:32.374
And I think good writing is something that centers itself right in that special relationship between two minds.

01:32.394 --> 01:37.302
And I like to push that edge and explore that edge in the writing I like best.

01:37.282 --> 01:47.793
does center itself in the reading process.

01:47.813 --> 01:56.182
And by that I mean good writing probably creates a space between the mind or the imagination of the reader and the mind and imagination of the writer.

01:56.203 --> 02:01.548
And then the book, this thing, this art that writing produces enacts itself somewhere in the middle.

02:01.568 --> 02:02.209
So there's this product which...

02:02.189 --> 02:10.866
A good author does a lot of the work to create, but it's almost impossible without a good reader also in there in that same space.

02:11.200 --> 02:26.882
That's how I visualize the whole thing.

02:26.902 --> 02:32.830
I did an interview yesterday with Andre White, whose first book was banned in his home country, South Africa.

02:32.850 --> 02:34.692
He said, this was the worst thing that could happen to a writer.

02:34.712 --> 02:35.974
I was a writer without a reader.

02:36.415 --> 02:36.835
Imagine that.

02:36.855 --> 02:38.758
And then he writes today, and he said, he writes about South Africa or South Africa.

02:38.778 --> 02:38.878
Yeah.

02:38.858 --> 02:53.406
And yet 60% of the people in this country can't read him.

02:53.426 --> 02:53.907
They are unable to read.

02:53.927 --> 02:55.551
I'm wondering, you know, within all this, do you have a sense of your readership?

02:55.571 --> 02:56.172
Who's he writing for, I think?

02:56.192 --> 02:56.833
I mean, do you find influence...

02:56.813 --> 03:08.060
Not the primary subjects of his writing, but at least she's published in 29 languages.

03:08.080 --> 03:09.002
I'm not asking you to compare yourself anyway.

03:09.022 --> 03:09.724
I just thought you'd call that out.

03:09.744 --> 03:10.787
Have you decided yet, or do you need some more time?

03:10.807 --> 03:10.907
Okay.

03:11.360 --> 03:23.998
and we're winning.

03:24.018 --> 03:24.379
Audience, kind of.

03:24.399 --> 03:24.699
Yeah, everyone.

03:24.719 --> 03:27.503
You really, there's really some discussion in this book about who the writer is writing for.

03:27.524 --> 03:32.491
I mean, have you ever read a work in progress to your own father?

03:33.372 --> 03:35.054
No, no.

03:35.075 --> 03:36.637
I never have read a work in progress.

03:36.657 --> 03:39.561
He's heard work in progress as part of an audience.

03:39.963 --> 03:47.413
Yeah, what's said in there is pretty accurate about my own experience.

03:47.433 --> 03:52.079
I never sat down one-on-one and read to him.

03:52.740 --> 03:57.286
And that causes me a certain amount of unhappiness or sadness.

03:57.967 --> 04:04.956
Yeah, but that's not... I think that's just not his personality.

04:04.976 --> 04:06.819
It's not my personality.

04:06.839 --> 04:08.721
I'm sorry maybe that it isn't,

04:08.701 --> 04:15.132
But we communicated in other ways.

04:15.152 --> 04:23.506
We communicated through sports and nonverbal stuff.

04:23.526 --> 04:26.772
But that was certainly significant enough for you to be alert, not only to be alert to it, but to write it in this book.

04:26.792 --> 04:28.995
Well, it just struck me one day.

04:29.015 --> 04:29.376
It just struck me.

04:30.149 --> 04:34.596
The same way it struck me one day that I never wrote a children's book while I had kids.

04:34.817 --> 04:37.140
You know, the path not taken, the road not taken.

04:37.842 --> 04:48.319
And these things, these moments are very touching and very poignant, but you can't change things, you can't go back.

04:48.339 --> 04:55.431
It's striking, and you write about it, and maybe somebody else picks it up and maybe decides to read a story to their father.

04:55.451 --> 04:56.933
I mean, my son has read...

04:57.503 --> 05:03.298
Lots of stories to me that he's written right in.

05:03.379 --> 05:06.527
My son's a big fellow.

05:06.647 --> 05:07.790
He's 28.

05:07.810 --> 05:12.222
He's already edited an anthology, so he has a book in print.

05:14.547 --> 05:18.135
It's called Soul Fires.

05:18.155 --> 05:21.482
It's one word.

05:21.702 --> 05:23.506
It's published by Viking.

05:24.247 --> 05:29.960
Wait a minute, is that right?

05:29.980 --> 05:30.701
Yes.

05:30.801 --> 05:35.391
Daniel, and he's one of the editors, along with Rohan Preston.

05:35.371 --> 05:42.283
And it's a book of writing of young black men on the themes of love and violence.

05:42.303 --> 05:57.750
What's unique about it is it's not just writers per se, but it's guys who are actors, guys who have been in prison, guys who are regular working stiffs, all under 30, all talking about these two themes.

05:58.507 --> 06:02.794
So it's an anthology that's got a lot of attention, a lot of response.

06:02.834 --> 06:04.137
He's learned a lot from it.

06:04.237 --> 06:05.599
It opens a little door for him.

06:06.180 --> 06:08.644
Is he a writer or an actor?

06:08.785 --> 06:11.349
He wants to be a fiction writer.

06:11.369 --> 06:11.870
He is a fiction writer.

06:12.090 --> 06:16.758
But this book was a chance to get in print, get his name out there, make connections.

06:16.899 --> 06:21.747
Very young, very young age to have a published book out there too.

06:21.727 --> 06:23.950
And he has guts.

06:23.970 --> 06:28.055
I mean, he's trying to make it, as a writer, in a way that I never had.

06:28.195 --> 06:30.838
I've always had a day job.

06:32.760 --> 06:36.044
Because I grew up having nothing, and so you have those fears.

06:36.065 --> 06:46.317
Once you have those fears of having nothing, you never quite, at least I never quite, got past the point of wanting something secure.

06:46.904 --> 07:01.425
And now you have a wonderful position that you miss.

07:01.445 --> 07:04.009
Your writing is acknowledged the world over for its excellence, and it's great literary merit.

07:04.029 --> 07:06.092
And you continue to teach.

07:06.232 --> 07:08.035
It's still kind of harking back to the, you want this...

07:08.015 --> 07:12.146
Security of a regular job.

07:12.267 --> 07:17.080
It's also pretty practical.

07:17.971 --> 07:31.690
Get your ass back here.

07:31.710 --> 07:32.251
I'm not finished.

07:32.712 --> 07:36.036
Anyway, they're talking about the day job.

07:37.999 --> 07:38.360
Yeah.

07:38.380 --> 07:42.105
For all the claims and all the books out there, I would have...

07:42.828 --> 07:51.994
Even up until probably the last maybe 10 years, it would have been impractical to have a family.

07:52.531 --> 08:11.218
a decent standard of living and try to do that all on the basis of the writing.

08:11.238 --> 08:13.281
So the teaching has been necessary as much as anything else.

08:13.301 --> 08:16.545
I like to teach.

08:16.565 --> 08:17.106
It's a nice compliment.

08:17.126 --> 08:21.913
The writing is total, often by myself and I enjoy being with the students and it's pretty hard to get on their cases and push high standards and

08:22.332 --> 08:28.942
And then unless you're a total hypocrite, it comes back to me.

08:28.962 --> 08:30.885
When I'm writing, I hear my own voice.

08:30.905 --> 08:31.727
I hear that hectoring voice.

08:31.747 --> 08:32.588
Writing should be this.

08:32.608 --> 08:33.750
Writing should be that.

08:33.830 --> 08:34.872
Don't take shortcuts.

08:34.992 --> 08:37.135
Write about things that have meaning.

08:37.476 --> 08:39.659
I hear all that.

08:39.739 --> 08:42.504
I'm talking to myself.

08:42.564 --> 08:43.345
And I'm pushing standards for them.

08:43.325 --> 08:51.762
So what's nice here?

08:51.782 --> 08:52.083
Undergraduates?

08:52.103 --> 08:52.504
Graduates.

08:52.524 --> 08:52.945
Graduates.

08:52.965 --> 08:54.267
I prefer that.

08:54.909 --> 08:57.754
I mean, a good group of undergrads is fun in a separate way.

08:57.775 --> 09:03.206
You know, it's fun because you see the process unraveling.

09:03.226 --> 09:03.426
You see...

09:03.406 --> 09:31.523
and every now and again they're more daring because they don't have as much at stake so they'll write a story backwards or upside down and take chances in fact one of the things I have to do with graduate students sometimes or often is to remind them that there is something besides a well made Raymond Carver story there is something besides what they see in the little magazines and

09:31.756 --> 09:34.408
that comes as a surprise to somebody.

09:36.177 --> 09:44.284
Of course, you don't mind my jumping around, I hope.

09:44.304 --> 09:50.970
It all makes sense when I... In my writing, you're going to ask me, is it okay for you to jump around?

09:50.990 --> 09:51.431
Sure.

09:51.451 --> 09:55.054
I make sense of it.

09:55.074 --> 09:56.095
So do I, but jumping around is a problem.

09:56.335 --> 10:00.239
It's approximate, but it's also kind of a height.

10:00.419 --> 10:06.184
It's like, you know, you hear that and you think, well, has he been... was I just blocked or hiding or...

10:06.164 --> 10:12.310
There have been two books in the last three, well actually three books if you count.

10:15.783 --> 10:39.251
New short stories and a book of essays about my father and myself, and then cattle killing, and those all have been, I've been working on those in the last, say, four or five years.

10:39.271 --> 10:40.012
Do you go from one form to the other?

10:40.032 --> 10:42.295
I mean, do you say seamlessly or do you embark in a novel or a line of stories or essays?

10:42.315 --> 10:43.917
Usually a bunch of things going at once.

10:45.736 --> 10:56.289
The lines of demarcation aren't all that clear to me.

10:56.309 --> 11:04.198
Sooner or later, an idea crystallizes, and I know it's going to be a novel, or it's going to be a short story, or it's going to be an essay.

11:04.218 --> 11:11.507
But very recently, I was working on a piece about Emmett Till and shared it with a good friend of mine, Michael Felwell, who's been my editor in some ways.

11:12.854 --> 11:18.261
Somebody I give a manuscript to very early in his opinion I trust.

11:18.281 --> 11:20.724
And we're talking about it.

11:21.244 --> 11:21.384
No, no.

11:21.404 --> 11:27.852
He's a friend who teaches at UMass.

11:27.872 --> 11:31.817
And he's called his name?

11:31.837 --> 11:32.698
B-H-E-L-W-E-L-L.

11:33.599 --> 11:35.141
And he's Jamaican.

11:35.161 --> 11:38.325
He's been in this country since the Civil Rights Movement in the 60s.

11:38.345 --> 11:40.768
He's a novelist and an essayist.

11:41.626 --> 11:56.628
But a man of real good judgment and taste, and I can sort of trust him at an early stage of a manuscript to share it and not intrude on it, not mash it.

11:56.649 --> 12:05.001
So anyway, we're talking, and after we talked for a while, he said, you know, sometimes...

12:04.981 --> 12:16.131
He said, sometimes you're referring to this thing as a story and other times you talk about it as an essay.

12:16.151 --> 12:17.032
So you better make up your mind.

12:17.052 --> 12:19.053
And I kind of resented that at first because I wanted it to be somewhere in between.

12:19.073 --> 12:29.883
But then I realized that, okay, I could write something that's in between, but I better know real clearly in my own head, one way or another.

12:29.903 --> 12:31.945
So that was very helpful to me.

12:31.965 --> 12:34.347
I went back and now it's an essay that...

12:35.052 --> 12:53.692
It has a fictional technique in it, and it pushes like a story, but I'm clear about what it is now.

12:53.712 --> 12:54.474
You wrote the piece about tennis play.

12:54.494 --> 12:55.356
Did you play a lot of basketball in Europe?

12:56.618 --> 13:12.052
That was my passion.

13:12.072 --> 13:13.834
I played a lot of basketball until two years ago.

13:13.854 --> 13:19.760
Well, now I run because I have a degenerative vertebrae and they squeeze on the nerves and I'm not supposed to play anymore.

13:19.780 --> 13:20.901
I'm not supposed to run anymore, really, but I still do.

13:20.921 --> 13:24.364
I played in college and played semi-pro ball, so it's been...

13:24.800 --> 13:30.525
As much as writing something, it's just a passion.

13:30.545 --> 13:34.608
Now you mentioned the passion coming up as a kid.

13:34.628 --> 13:36.010
Did you want to be a basketball player?

13:36.250 --> 13:36.570
Absolutely.

13:36.810 --> 13:41.454
That was my main reason for getting good grades and going to college.

13:41.474 --> 13:43.976
I wanted to play college football.

13:44.537 --> 13:48.840
I wanted to play college basketball.

13:48.860 --> 13:51.102
Probably wanted to play football before basketball.

13:51.122 --> 13:52.163
But I never got through a football season.

13:52.464 --> 13:54.005
No, I was a quarterback.

13:54.025 --> 13:54.165
Really?

13:55.141 --> 13:59.473
defensive halfback and a halfback.

13:59.493 --> 14:05.370
This will date me, but our team in high school played single wings.

14:06.278 --> 14:19.110
halfback really was a castle.

14:19.130 --> 14:23.134
Might I ask all of you are?

14:23.754 --> 14:23.995
Fifty thorn.

14:24.235 --> 14:26.897
It's no secret.

14:26.917 --> 14:28.179
I'm just hearing that we're in the same generation.

14:28.199 --> 14:30.601
I earned every one.

14:30.621 --> 14:30.841
No regrets.

14:30.861 --> 14:31.802
So your first book was published in 1967.

14:31.822 --> 14:33.944
Were you still on scrolling when your first book was published?

14:33.964 --> 14:34.024
No.

14:34.004 --> 14:37.429
I just finished the Iowa Writers' Workshop.

14:37.449 --> 14:54.936
I mean, I was in the Writers' Workshop when the book was... I was in... By telling me that, by the way, I sell this piece to Des Moines.

14:54.956 --> 14:57.059
Pardon me for being entrepreneurial.

14:57.179 --> 14:59.863
Iowa City, yes, I'm an Iowa City product.

14:59.883 --> 15:00.905
Go Hawkeyes.

15:00.925 --> 15:02.147
One of my favorite places.

15:02.167 --> 15:02.307
Well...

15:03.738 --> 15:25.678
Thank you.

15:25.658 --> 15:41.638
You know, there is kind of an Iowa Writings.

15:41.658 --> 15:47.545
Did you say there's an Iowa Writings workshop agenda at all?

15:47.605 --> 15:49.868
Not agenda, per se, but kind of writing name.

15:49.888 --> 15:53.893
The biggest danger of workshops is that the instructors will lobby for some kind of template.

15:54.194 --> 16:04.879
a way to write a story and students will get confused or the writers themselves who are teaching are confused and they get

16:05.264 --> 16:23.788
And the confusion is that all stories have to be written on certain things.

16:23.808 --> 16:24.488
Sir, this mustard has honey in it.

16:24.508 --> 16:25.450
We only have a grape coupon or a bourbon.

16:25.470 --> 16:25.850
Which is the honey?

16:25.870 --> 16:26.131
I don't know.

16:26.151 --> 16:26.571
I don't need mustard.

16:26.591 --> 16:27.052
Why don't you try that?

16:27.072 --> 16:28.514
And when I come back to the start, I'll bring you a grape coupon.

16:28.534 --> 16:28.634
Okay.

16:28.654 --> 16:29.194
That's really good, though.

16:29.214 --> 16:29.415
Thank you.

16:29.435 --> 16:29.635
Thank you.

16:29.615 --> 16:48.703
She is brisk and brisk.

16:48.683 --> 16:53.251
Excuse me, that's all.

16:54.052 --> 17:01.364
It's not going to be broadcast.

17:01.485 --> 17:07.495
Or maybe it will be.

17:07.515 --> 17:07.795
I'd like that.

17:07.815 --> 17:08.036
I wouldn't.

17:08.056 --> 17:08.597
I've never had a complaint.

17:08.617 --> 17:09.358
Close to a thousand other interviews.

17:09.338 --> 17:21.779
So where were we?

17:21.799 --> 17:26.227
We were just jumping around in the biography.

17:26.247 --> 17:29.372
I guess I'm looking for the experience that went into the... This book comes close to 30 years after your first book was published, right?

17:29.858 --> 17:42.747
Yeah, yeah, it's almost 30 years.

17:42.767 --> 17:44.872
Is there 30 years of professional experience that has gone into this in terms of life, living experience?

17:44.892 --> 17:45.032
Well...

17:45.012 --> 17:47.615
Very much so.

17:50.638 --> 18:03.192
The first time I came across the plague in Philadelphia was in the late 60s.

18:03.853 --> 18:12.302
I know that because it was part of my effort to educate myself about African-American literature.

18:13.227 --> 18:27.742
studying stuff in the Philadelphia Free Library and in the Chambord Collection in order to put together an anthology of African American riffs.

18:27.762 --> 18:27.962
And Norton

18:28.567 --> 18:36.636
As a coincidence, yesterday I received from Norton a copy of their big, fat, new anthology on Afro-American Lit.

18:36.656 --> 18:51.473
But then they weren't sure whether they wanted to do a separate book or wanted me to be a talent scout and integrate the older anthology that everybody who's ever taken an American Lit course probably has used in college.

18:53.415 --> 18:55.097
And I found out...

18:56.107 --> 19:07.047
As I thought about taking that job and did eventually take it, I realized how little I knew about African-American youth.

19:07.068 --> 19:12.798
And so I embarked on a self-study, self-teaching program, which turned out to be a second education.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.301
And that began in the 60s.

19:16.154 --> 19:26.770
and the book never materialized, got lost in the politics of separate or equal.

19:26.930 --> 19:36.023
You know, should we do a volume and integrate some black writers or should we do separate and they never could decide.

19:36.043 --> 19:39.188
So it didn't work at that time.

19:39.208 --> 19:41.792
Now, 30 years later, one has come out.

19:41.812 --> 19:44.035
But I read Bishop Allen's narrative in the library in a kind of facsimile version.

19:45.466 --> 20:08.688
exciting to me because it told the whole story of the plague and William Carey's letter blaming black people for the plague and et cetera, et cetera.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.570
And I knew there were many, many stories there and I tried to write it at that time.

20:10.590 --> 20:12.211
And I did write it, but it wasn't a very good story.

20:12.231 --> 20:14.574
And then tried it again 20 years later in fever and was satisfied with it as a story, but knew there was still more.

20:14.594 --> 20:15.034
And so this is another

20:16.381 --> 20:37.039
you'll never be finished never be finished because to me there are certain events that have a kind of resonance that it's impossible to wring all the meaning out of and the more i think about them the more i learn about them

20:39.517 --> 20:43.223
It makes sense.

20:43.243 --> 20:51.135
And I have to do a second or third or fourth take on that.

20:51.155 --> 20:58.587
And I think about composers or painters who've done views of Delft, you know, 17 of them.

20:58.607 --> 20:59.348
So if something is interesting to me,

21:04.508 --> 21:30.303
It keeps energizing me, and I keep feeling I'm learning different things by considering.

21:30.323 --> 21:30.583
Ideally, yes.

21:30.603 --> 21:31.084
I mean, I don't do that.

21:31.104 --> 21:31.765
I think that's a good experience.

21:33.449 --> 21:57.521
But on the other hand, I know I have abiding concerns.

21:57.541 --> 21:58.662
I know there are questions I ask myself again and again.

21:58.682 --> 21:59.403
I know I return to certain material.

21:59.423 --> 22:00.505
I know there are certain jobs I want to keep refining.

22:00.525 --> 22:01.987
The ability to capture the eloquence and the power of the oral narrative.

22:02.007 --> 22:02.848
The stories I heard as a kid in my family.

22:05.123 --> 22:14.516
And to keep those stories alive, I'll never lose that urge, I don't think.

22:14.536 --> 22:15.218
And there'll always be more to do.

22:17.982 --> 22:41.370
in a book I'm writing now, and I think it's, I understand more about how to do it.

22:41.390 --> 22:41.891
It'll be better, I think.

22:41.911 --> 22:43.132
So those kinds of tasks will hold the work together, I think.

22:43.152 --> 22:44.454
Is this the central metaphor in your life as a writer?

22:44.474 --> 22:45.475
Is this the central metaphor?

22:46.788 --> 23:01.832
The central metaphor is that, for me anyway, is that writing is a process.

23:01.852 --> 23:02.473
And the process is what counts.

23:02.493 --> 23:02.974
There's a kind of art.

23:05.198 --> 23:09.408
a career.

23:09.428 --> 23:21.939
And in the art, while that art is working its way out, there is good style out.

23:21.959 --> 23:22.701
It's almost accidental when and

23:23.508 --> 23:34.523
And I do the best I can with each one.

23:34.543 --> 23:44.477
But the joy for me is the process continuing.

23:44.497 --> 23:44.718
Absolutely.

23:44.738 --> 23:45.499
When a book's over, it really is over.

23:45.519 --> 23:50.746
I always try to have something in the works before one finishes.

23:50.766 --> 23:52.789
Because when one finishes, it's kind of...

23:53.090 --> 24:10.289
It's depressing, you know, postpartum blues and all that.

24:10.309 --> 24:16.696
And Hemingway made the advice, you know, never finish without having another one in the works.

24:16.716 --> 24:17.377
And we know what happened to him.

24:17.397 --> 24:19.019
He tried to avoid the postpartum blues and blew his head off because he couldn't.

24:19.039 --> 24:19.679
Or he realized that he couldn't.

24:19.699 --> 24:20.380
It's just arguable, too, isn't it?

24:21.507 --> 24:36.296
And nobody knows what he was thinking that last minute of those last years.

24:36.317 --> 24:37.339
Do you read Hemingway?

24:37.359 --> 24:37.799
Do you like Hemingway?

24:37.820 --> 24:38.681
I have read Hemingway.

24:38.701 --> 24:39.583
I never read Hemingway systematically.

24:42.162 --> 24:50.618
I came across books that I liked.

24:50.638 --> 24:54.606
At Oxford, I read two or three books of his.

24:54.626 --> 25:00.698
The Spanish books, because I was doing a lot of traveling with Spain.

25:00.718 --> 25:01.199
So that was kind of fun.

25:01.219 --> 25:01.960
And I still saw myself as re-tracing.

25:08.707 --> 25:27.155
lived down and out in Paris in Rome and, you know, brought back these stories about the old country.

25:27.175 --> 25:28.557
I still saw myself as part of that.

25:28.577 --> 25:32.182
I still do in a way that I've learned a little bit more.

25:32.202 --> 25:33.344
My goals are a little more individual.

25:33.364 --> 25:34.706
I know my history is different than theirs was.

25:34.726 --> 25:34.866
I know

25:36.432 --> 25:58.169
The sort of romance with Europe they had is one that, after a certain point, had less appeal for me.

25:58.189 --> 25:59.091
In other words, I learned from their example.

25:59.111 --> 25:59.892
Of all things, 18th century literature.

26:00.361 --> 26:16.724
You really are a perfect person to engage in this whole discussion.

26:16.744 --> 26:18.927
You know, the concept of the red-white European male, the relevance of the Western canon and curricula today.

26:19.227 --> 26:40.110
Certainly you're aware to this whole, I can't believe this debate, I've just entered it myself in the last year.

26:40.130 --> 26:41.792
You know, you're aware of things that are going on before you enter it.

26:41.812 --> 26:42.133
It's very mixed.

26:42.153 --> 26:43.394
Famous amount of anger and vehemence and intransigence on it.

26:43.414 --> 26:45.977
And I will quote you, by the way, fully and accurately in this new book, which is under contract to Henry Holt, by the way.

26:45.957 --> 27:08.714
Well, I'm on the record about these kinds of things.

27:08.734 --> 27:10.277
The debate in some ways is...

27:12.788 --> 27:24.503
It's important, but to me it's also boring, because it's somewhat like arguing about

27:27.487 --> 27:41.229
Whether we should be called African-American or black or Negro, it doesn't get down to the issues.

27:41.349 --> 27:42.872
It seldom gets down to it.

27:43.052 --> 27:45.376
If the debate would get down to the issues, it's interesting.

27:45.396 --> 27:46.778
But I think it seldom does.

27:47.737 --> 28:07.472
There's a lot of grandstanding, a lot of kind of one-way conversations about what people believe.

28:07.492 --> 28:08.954
What are the fundamental issues then that are being ignored?

28:08.974 --> 28:09.656
That our literature is interested.

28:09.676 --> 28:11.038
That there are no disinterested books.

28:11.058 --> 28:11.299
Interested.

28:11.319 --> 28:11.619
Interested.

28:11.639 --> 28:12.681
Yes, somebody has an interest in what they're doing.

28:12.965 --> 28:17.530
and critics have an interest in what they're saying.

28:17.550 --> 28:29.224
There never has been and never will be any way to define once and for all that this is good and that's bad and this is in the middle, top ten.

28:29.244 --> 28:35.972
There'll never be any way to do that.

28:36.453 --> 28:39.116
I'm an English teacher.

28:39.776 --> 28:41.599
I had a small college day after the 60s.

28:41.619 --> 28:42.820
I don't think I ever once heard the word, the Western canon.

28:44.200 --> 28:49.026
No, but that's not to say it wasn't there.

28:49.046 --> 28:50.528
It was there.

28:50.548 --> 28:52.250
Yeah, and nobody was talking about it.

28:52.270 --> 28:55.254
The assumptions were all implicit.

28:55.274 --> 28:55.574
That's correct.

28:55.594 --> 29:02.163
And now people are examining the assumptions and making them explicit.

29:02.303 --> 29:06.368
I mean, that's fine.

29:06.388 --> 29:07.930
But nobody's going to...

29:08.348 --> 29:24.080
If the object of that is to come up with a new set of absolutes, then it's crazy.

29:24.100 --> 29:24.420
You know, crazy.

29:24.440 --> 29:26.044
You know, but what does concern a lot of people is a question of relevance.

29:26.064 --> 29:26.745
It makes me irrelevant to society.

29:27.637 --> 29:44.437
Scott Churro just told me that it was two weeks ago.

29:44.457 --> 29:45.217
I didn't interview with him.

29:45.237 --> 29:46.539
He said he was at a dinner with the president of Amherst College.

29:46.559 --> 29:47.380
I guess Scott is an economist at Amherst.

29:47.400 --> 29:48.762
Where the president was informed that they had just graduated summa.

29:48.782 --> 29:49.122
Summa in English.

29:51.869 --> 30:12.872
You know, like Gary said, we did that.

30:12.892 --> 30:14.474
Well, the way, you know.

30:14.494 --> 30:16.656
You know, I think it would require people to do anything, but there is a poor knowledge I would call it.

30:16.676 --> 30:19.159
I mean, call your degree in literature and call it anything you want, but you don't want to call it English literature.

30:19.139 --> 30:27.029
Well, can you possibly avoid studying the Shakespeare, Chester, and Dalton Spencer?

30:27.049 --> 30:27.310
I don't know.

30:27.330 --> 30:27.591
I don't know.

30:27.611 --> 30:27.872
I don't know.

30:27.892 --> 30:28.153
I don't know.

30:29.365 --> 30:42.531
Well, my sense is that you can make a very good case for that position.

30:42.591 --> 30:49.144
The one you just... I think you can make a real good case, and I probably would make it.

30:49.164 --> 30:49.264
Um...

30:49.885 --> 31:16.534
The only thing some people are asking is for the case to be made, not just assume that because that's the list that we receive, that it's a list that is somehow sanctioned or somehow almost divine or deterministic.

31:18.235 --> 31:37.615
The energy and the time and the thought that's going into examining the assumptions and examining why these things are worth well, I think that is oftentimes well spent.

31:37.635 --> 31:38.076
Well spent.

31:38.096 --> 31:45.323
Because there is a, like any tradition, I think it's traditions that are not simply enforced from above.

31:46.282 --> 32:02.073
Traditions really are not static, even in the most conservative societies.

32:02.093 --> 32:06.302
You know, there's room for the individual to add a little twist to a traditional dance, where somebody sticks a feather in their hat where there wasn't a feather before.

32:06.322 --> 32:07.564
You know, even very rigid society, so tradition changes.

32:08.202 --> 32:10.965
And I think that's a healthy activity.

32:13.889 --> 32:21.279
And I think you can make an argument for, let's say, an undergraduate degree.

32:21.299 --> 32:23.541
You can make an argument for linguistics.

32:23.561 --> 32:26.605
You can make an argument for comparative literature.

32:26.846 --> 32:31.932
You can make an argument for anthropology as fundamental to the teaching of literature.

32:35.287 --> 32:43.836
and maybe just as fundamental as studying individual writers.

32:44.656 --> 33:00.332
So what you want to do by the time the students finish is give them the overview and the knowledge that would allow them to pick up any text and have some ideas of how to approach it, what to do with it, how to teach it, what they needed to understand.

33:00.818 --> 33:12.814
You know, you don't teach language by going through every possible conversation.

33:12.834 --> 33:21.325
You get some sort of systematic approach and get that in somebody's head, and then it's their responsibility to go out and talk and engage people and learn different vernaculars and all that.

33:21.345 --> 33:24.128
You can use the same model for studied literature.

33:24.148 --> 33:27.653
So to throw up your hands just because somebody doesn't have Shakespeare,

33:29.607 --> 33:35.656
a tenable position.

33:35.736 --> 33:45.291
I mean, you have to know what else the student learned and why.

33:45.311 --> 33:48.096
What's the rationale?

33:48.116 --> 33:49.357
What can that student do?

33:49.378 --> 33:56.188
And would you rather have that student teach Shakespeare in two years than somebody who's read Shakespeare as an undergraduate, maybe in a survey course, maybe taught very superficially, you know,

33:57.282 --> 34:14.330
I would actually love to find out who this student is.

34:14.350 --> 34:14.610
I don't know.

34:14.630 --> 34:16.894
I mean, to me, the most rewarding course I remember when I graduated was in Shakespeare in Shakespeare.

34:16.874 --> 34:40.939
I mean, you quoted, you quoted, you quoted, and you, except there's that language in basketball in your New Yorker piece, which I thought was a wonderfully relevant use of a, you know, a 350-year-old play or whatever.

34:40.959 --> 34:42.261
And a decidedly contemporary context there with Dennis Rodman.

34:42.281 --> 34:42.441
Amazing.

34:42.461 --> 34:43.422
You can talk about the relevance of Shakespeare.

34:44.026 --> 34:58.466
Maybe it would even get old Dennis to read it.

34:58.486 --> 35:05.276
That would really be an accomplished piece.

35:05.296 --> 35:08.941
Well, the funny thing is, Shakespeare read Rodman, but it would be really unusual if he had Rodman read Shakespeare.

35:08.961 --> 35:11.424
That's a whole high school, isn't it?

35:11.444 --> 35:12.666
So this is, to just totally jump right under being a piece...

35:12.646 --> 35:29.908
This novel, I'm sorry, rather than this novel, has been in progress for 30 years, 20 years?

35:29.928 --> 35:33.472
Yeah, you know, somebody asked you, well, how long you've been working on the novel?

35:33.492 --> 35:39.480
One answer is, well, since I was old enough to sit in my mother's lap and be rocked by her and hear her sing, I started to learn the rhythms that I wanted to get this novel.

35:42.245 --> 36:03.128
About four years.

36:03.148 --> 36:04.630
I had my mind on a particular idea and knew that I was working on a novel.

36:04.650 --> 36:05.150
What do you mean by that?

36:05.170 --> 36:06.632
Well, what I meant by that is it's going to be a different kind of novel.

36:07.827 --> 36:13.234
than most people are used to, most readers.

36:13.254 --> 36:23.308
And so in the first section, I try to create or line out kind of a contract with the reader.

36:23.328 --> 36:24.750
A warning label, if you will.

36:24.770 --> 36:25.651
A contract.

36:25.671 --> 36:29.957
These are the things I'm going to do, and these are the sort of things you have to do.

36:29.977 --> 36:37.007
And if I'm doing my stuff well, and you're willing to do your part, you know, a book will evolve out of this, right?

36:37.510 --> 36:44.013
Don't expect it to be A. Don't expect it to be B. Read it for what it is.

36:44.033 --> 36:44.696
Go slowly.

36:45.398 --> 36:46.221
Figure it out.

36:47.028 --> 36:53.597
I'm trying to put instructions on how to read the novel early on.

36:53.617 --> 36:59.425
Instructions, implicit instructions in the narrative.

36:59.445 --> 37:03.451
Those instructions are in all writing anyway.

37:04.031 --> 37:07.436
It's a feature of all writing.

37:07.636 --> 37:11.702
I mean, if you have a novel that says once upon a time,

37:12.391 --> 37:15.075
Already there are certain things clicking in.

37:15.095 --> 37:21.946
You know a certain relationship between the reader and the writer in the story.

37:21.966 --> 37:41.335
If you say it was a crisp day in November and John entered his Volvo and turned the key, already there are assumptions about reality, assumptions about the reader's relationship to the material, assumptions about...

37:41.618 --> 38:02.088
Here, reader, what you're going to do is have somebody talk to you, and they're going to pretend there's something like a camera, and you're going to both, or maybe even better, video camera, and you're going to hear what the camera records, and your perspective on this stuff is sort of like you're looking at it on a TV screen.

38:02.208 --> 38:07.896
It's not there, those words, those instructions aren't there explicitly, but you sort of know all that.

38:08.399 --> 38:22.654
when you hear, it was a crisp day in November and why I've been climbing into his car, you know, that's what's operated, those rules, those techniques.

38:22.674 --> 38:23.595
And the reader buys into it.

38:23.615 --> 38:37.630
If it begins as a stream of consciousness, oh shit, goddamn car won't start, oh fuck, where's my old lady, here comes a stream of consciousness, vernacular voice, the reader is being told, hey, there is no middle distance.

38:38.825 --> 38:43.235
I do those and a couple more, many more.

38:43.375 --> 38:55.382
I tell a reader that you can't depend on a grammatical person, like first or third to orient, to be...

38:56.527 --> 39:00.331
stable, but you can't depend on time.

39:00.351 --> 39:06.477
You can't depend, you can't look for a lot of cues about what's spoken and what's thought.

39:06.497 --> 39:08.840
You can't look for conventional cues.

39:08.860 --> 39:11.242
You can't look for conventional punctuation cues.

39:12.504 --> 39:25.217
You have to experience this and learn the footholds and the handholds exist in a slightly different way.

39:26.058 --> 39:40.799
Well, you know, I write about complicated things.

39:40.819 --> 39:42.341
So I thought of trying to go on with those complicated things.

39:42.361 --> 39:43.543
And part of the fun for me is to find for each book.

39:44.283 --> 39:50.032
or each story, a special way to tell it.

39:50.352 --> 39:58.464
A way that's partly dependent on tradition, what's come before, but a way that is spontaneous, it's improvised.

39:58.704 --> 40:00.006
Because that's what turns me on.

40:00.026 --> 40:01.188
That way it's like sport.

40:02.470 --> 40:08.479
No matter how many points you scored yesterday in the half-court game, today, not one counts.

40:09.060 --> 40:10.662
You know, you've got to get...

40:13.342 --> 40:26.610
And that kind of situation is attractive to me.

40:26.630 --> 40:27.692
I like that.

40:27.713 --> 40:29.376
You use the comparison with sports as an athlete, of course.

40:30.757 --> 40:57.958
I know what I'm having fun.

40:57.978 --> 40:58.198
I know when

40:59.393 --> 41:13.797
I'm being spoken to when my unconscious and my instincts are at work and there's a kind of effortlessness while it's happening.

41:13.817 --> 41:21.570
But I've been writing long enough to know tomorrow I'm going to have to look at this shit real closely because maybe it was too easy.

41:21.871 --> 41:33.904
But there are grace times when the characters speak for themselves.

41:34.204 --> 41:42.693
I know the book so well that there's an illusion that it's almost writing itself.

41:42.713 --> 41:43.875
Do you rewrite a life?

41:43.895 --> 41:44.315
And that's a joy.

41:44.335 --> 41:44.555
That's fun.

41:44.575 --> 41:46.157
It's a joy.

41:46.627 --> 42:05.243
Every morning, the way I start, or most mornings, is by reading a certain amount of what was done before, either immediately before or a while before, to pick up the rhythms, to remember, to revise.

42:06.758 --> 42:13.806
And that's how I get started.

42:14.066 --> 42:15.488
Right.

42:15.508 --> 42:20.254
Even when it's finished.

42:20.274 --> 42:22.276
You write on a new processor?

42:23.778 --> 42:24.959
You write longhand.

42:24.979 --> 42:35.331
And that process also permits or requires a lot of revision because I'll write longhand in a book, in like a hardback empty book.

42:36.509 --> 42:43.836
And then I have to take that and write it out on a longhand legal pad before anybody else can read it.

42:44.423 --> 42:50.072
That's about the fifth or sixth.

42:51.434 --> 42:53.196
I love it.

42:53.877 --> 43:01.449
When I was a kid, I was either writing or painting.

43:01.729 --> 43:07.779
And I went to art school a little bit.

43:08.039 --> 43:09.862
Me and Hitler.

43:09.882 --> 43:10.603
Both went to art school.

43:10.623 --> 43:11.224
Great fraternity, huh?

43:13.769 --> 43:23.860
So, you know, longhand allows me, really, to draw the letters.

43:23.880 --> 43:32.209
It gives me a visual sense of what's going on in the piece.

43:32.229 --> 43:36.874
So I still art letters, and this nerve problem started bothering my hand.

43:37.968 --> 44:02.220
have lots of fun like one day would be big letters another day they might be very small letters and they might be slanted you know just it's like painting with the words for a long time my wife would type up the first draft and that's when it starts to become real for me

44:03.078 --> 44:08.889
become more objective.

44:08.909 --> 44:15.783
Now I can actually see it and begin to make another set of revisions.

44:16.123 --> 44:19.650
But now I have a lady who types it into a computer, she punches it out, and I don't read it.

44:19.670 --> 44:21.494
You don't read it on screen.

44:21.814 --> 44:22.916
Would that change it for you, do you think so?

44:22.936 --> 44:23.297
I'm sure it would.

44:24.138 --> 44:35.153
The process I use is kind of slow, but it's quite painstaking.

44:35.734 --> 44:43.385
Again, it's like, to use a metaphor, it's like eating.

44:43.405 --> 44:44.646
I have no desire to take a pill and have nourishment.

44:44.666 --> 44:45.628
Because I like to eat.

44:45.648 --> 44:47.710
You know, the grease, the getting, the chewing, the heartburn, whatever.

44:47.731 --> 44:48.091
I love to do that.

44:48.111 --> 44:49.753
That's what I, you know, that's what eating is about.

44:49.773 --> 44:50.294
It's not just nourishment.

44:50.314 --> 44:52.457
So, I have no real need to speed up the process.

44:53.922 --> 44:57.411
as I got older, and it may happen.

44:57.451 --> 45:04.168
When you get that sense of not having time, then I might want to be able to make this, speed up this process.

45:07.355 --> 45:24.839
You might figure I have more to say and not enough time to say it.

45:24.859 --> 45:25.660
But I'm not sure that's going to happen.

45:25.680 --> 45:26.582
You mentioned the art of your career earlier.

45:26.602 --> 45:27.603
So you're content with it and you actually see it.

45:27.623 --> 45:28.084
Like that was your one?

45:28.104 --> 45:28.324
Yeah, yeah.

45:28.344 --> 45:29.025
With a beginning, a middle, and...

45:29.005 --> 45:50.075
I hope so.

45:50.095 --> 45:50.635
But you always fail, right?

45:50.655 --> 45:50.996
One always fails.

45:51.016 --> 45:51.937
That's what Giacometti says anyway, I believe.

45:51.957 --> 45:52.498
Anything Giacometti says...

45:54.976 --> 46:01.145
It made sense to me that you always fail.

46:01.165 --> 46:11.280
You know, the piece of sculpture, the individual novel, you wanted it to be so much.

46:11.440 --> 46:13.623
You had so many ideas for it.

46:13.903 --> 46:23.397
I don't know if he ever felt that was a perfect fit between what he pulled out, what he found, or what he knew was in there and what he actually got out.

46:24.085 --> 46:46.428
No, the feeling is, my feeling is, both I want to get the work at hand as perfect as I can, but the next work is a chance to always improve on the thing before.

46:46.448 --> 46:47.389
That's where the arc comes in.

46:47.409 --> 46:48.490
And maybe it's an ever ascending arc.

46:52.334 --> 47:13.649
Like a rainbow come back down, yes.

47:13.670 --> 47:15.072
I mean, I'd like to go out climbing as opposed to sinking in the west.

47:15.092 --> 47:16.053
Jim Brown and Ted Williams are the other heroes.

47:16.074 --> 47:16.975
There's no downward spiral, but I don't know.

47:18.305 --> 47:32.931
Let's check in with him.

47:32.951 --> 47:33.833
Let's do talk about the killer killing here.

47:33.813 --> 47:59.801
I think you touched on that earlier, but you're choosing that as an event to appropriate, not only in the novel, but as the title.

47:59.821 --> 48:00.341
You gentlemen, I'm eating?

48:00.361 --> 48:00.441
Yes.

48:00.461 --> 48:01.463
Yes, would you say we'd go for dessert and coffee?

48:01.483 --> 48:01.903
I'd like some coffee.

48:01.923 --> 48:02.464
Can I have a decaf, please?

48:02.484 --> 48:02.824
That's a dessert.

48:02.804 --> 48:21.584
I wanted to write a history novel.

48:21.604 --> 48:27.630
A history novel, to me, is useful probably if and only if it's also a novel that...

48:27.948 --> 48:30.211
embraces the present moment.

48:30.231 --> 48:35.720
I didn't want to write a history novel just for an antiquarian motive.

48:35.940 --> 48:47.738
It had to be something that was very much attuned or helped me tune in the present.

48:47.758 --> 48:50.462
And I also wanted to write a history novel

48:54.256 --> 48:57.208
And by that I mean... Thank you.

48:57.268 --> 48:58.360
By that I mean...

48:59.082 --> 49:05.489
In the same way that certain science fiction novels get bogged down with the machinery.

49:05.589 --> 49:07.431
How do people get around?

49:07.471 --> 49:09.614
What kind of crap are they wearing?

49:09.634 --> 49:12.197
What's the name of the vehicle they're in?

49:12.697 --> 49:17.262
How do you get air on an airless planet?

49:17.282 --> 49:19.605
Going off into all that stuff.

49:19.965 --> 49:27.454
I didn't want a history novel that had to depend on that kind of artifice, devices, gadgets.

49:27.614 --> 49:28.515
I know all that stuff.

49:29.137 --> 49:45.404
And that was part of the fun, from studying 18th century lit, from doing research for the book.

49:45.424 --> 49:48.068
I know an awful lot about the 18th century, about all kinds of out-of-the-way things.

49:48.088 --> 49:48.529
Like, I drew costumes.

49:48.509 --> 50:17.841
for a whole week I drew different kinds of costume things that people were wearing and looked up books that had 18th century costumes and shoes and learned about who had who wore what kind of material which levels of society had access to which kinds of material I had a book about a farm on 18th century farm work and it's funny because a lot of times go to the library and you can get a

50:18.665 --> 50:23.394
technical studies on some subjects.

50:23.975 --> 50:26.780
But it turns out kids' books are the best.

50:26.940 --> 50:35.977
These kind of modern kids' books that really give you the anatomy of an 18th century farm, the way you have to read forever in special sources.

50:36.678 --> 50:41.567
There's a picture on a couple of pages about how you get the...

50:42.661 --> 50:49.389
how you milk the cow, where the cow is, what the people are wearing, you know, one picture worth of many thousands of words.

50:49.409 --> 50:58.800
So I used kids' books a lot in the library in Naples, Maine, sure, for the everyday life.

50:58.820 --> 51:00.222
Naples, Maine?

51:00.242 --> 51:08.972
Well, the library was in Naples, Maine, and Maine, of course, has a long colonial history, so they had a lot of books about living in Maine in the 18th century.

51:10.977 --> 51:17.950
But then I did other kinds of research as well, reading in the literature when I was at Oxford.

51:18.048 --> 51:21.473
used very little of it.

51:21.614 --> 51:23.777
Or, no, I'll put it that way.

51:23.857 --> 51:28.003
I used it all, but I only put small amounts of it on the page.

51:28.023 --> 51:35.615
And there's a description, for instance, of a woman undressing, and as she undressed, I named the kinds of things she was wearing.

51:36.597 --> 51:45.270
It turned out that I didn't talk a lot about farm techniques, and I didn't talk a lot about the kinds of food that were in the house.

51:46.465 --> 51:48.588
But I did talk about baths.

51:49.309 --> 51:50.871
You know, I had to find out a lot about that.

51:50.891 --> 51:53.494
So the point is that I have to know all that stuff.

51:53.915 --> 51:55.396
And it's fun for me to get to know it.

51:55.917 --> 52:08.573
But then I don't want to, I didn't want the book to depend on that kind of illusion.

52:08.593 --> 52:10.295
There are so many things the reader does not know about your narrator or your reader.

52:10.316 --> 52:11.597
Do you know it?

52:11.617 --> 52:13.760
We don't know anything about these people?

52:13.780 --> 52:13.840
No.

52:13.820 --> 52:18.468
Well, in a sense that they were living, breathing individuals, yes.

52:19.370 --> 52:24.238
And I selected to tell you about certain things that happened to them and leave other things out.

52:24.258 --> 52:26.843
But the other things you do know.

52:27.965 --> 52:28.626
Yeah, I know.

52:28.746 --> 52:29.968
Yes.

52:29.989 --> 52:30.249
Clear to you.

52:30.269 --> 52:30.850
Well...

52:31.437 --> 52:42.679
I wouldn't say that I could write them down, but they're clear to me the way things are clear to me about my brother or my sister or my best friend.

52:42.879 --> 52:52.618
I don't need to be there daily to have a very strong impression and to be pretty good at predicting how they would react in certain situations.

52:52.598 --> 53:18.133
i can be away from my brothers for long periods of time and still know david's going to react sort of one way and otis react another way and robbie a third way so i know them in that sense as sort of family not somebody i'm with all the time yeah the characters i mean my brothers are family yes

53:20.088 --> 53:40.780
Well, frankly, an essay that starts for a

53:41.367 --> 53:53.318
critique or even an interview, beware, that starts Weidman's latest examination of the African American experience, blank, blank, you know, dot, dot, dot.

53:53.669 --> 54:05.247
It really, first of all, disappoints me.

54:05.267 --> 54:14.422
And it makes me feel, it disappoints me because somebody hasn't been paying attention.

54:14.442 --> 54:14.803
And I quite agree.

54:14.823 --> 54:16.265
It starts that way, but I think at some point it goes into the equation.

54:16.285 --> 54:17.327
At the beginning and certainly at the end of it.

54:17.347 --> 54:17.988
Or maybe you disagree with that.

54:18.008 --> 54:18.208
That's it.

54:18.914 --> 54:23.525
It definitely enters the equation, but not in a reductive sense.

54:24.528 --> 54:31.866
Yeah, but you'd be surprised how many pieces do lead with that.

54:31.946 --> 54:35.455
It's already categorizing the books.

54:35.435 --> 54:38.059
or the stories and saying that they belong.

54:38.079 --> 54:46.212
If you're interested in African-American lit, you might be interested in this book for whatever reason.

54:46.232 --> 54:51.721
That's implicit.

54:51.741 --> 54:54.265
Again, there's an instruction and a criticism.

54:54.285 --> 54:57.751
Yeah, well, I mean, if you read your own entry in the statue of Companion, the 20th century American literature, brand new.

54:57.831 --> 54:58.833
The first line is African-American writer.

54:58.853 --> 54:58.953
Yeah.

54:58.973 --> 54:59.894
You are, right?

54:59.914 --> 55:00.295
So, so, so, so, so,

55:00.275 --> 55:06.102
But here's the problem as I see it, and it's a problem in the culture.

55:06.122 --> 55:18.196
We have a terrible, maybe fatal confusion in the public mind and even in a sort of sophisticated literary mind between race and culture.

55:18.356 --> 55:22.320
I certainly am the product of African-descended culture.

55:22.421 --> 55:28.948
I mean, I'm of African descent and the culture is of African descent and has a particular history.

55:30.413 --> 55:40.365
And it's quite comparable to French culture or German culture or Italian culture or whatever.

55:40.385 --> 55:41.367
Greek culture.

55:41.587 --> 55:46.133
I don't know about Greeks.

55:47.795 --> 55:49.477
We'll put that one over.

55:49.497 --> 55:51.680
We'll talk about that later.

55:53.021 --> 55:53.742
And that's true.

55:53.762 --> 55:55.765
That's a fact.

55:55.805 --> 55:56.826
The problem is...

55:57.717 --> 56:03.424
that we confuse color and race with culture.

56:03.444 --> 56:17.062
So that if somebody, if we see a person of color, if we see a person of color or we hear about somebody's race, we think we know something about them.

56:17.082 --> 56:19.104
We think we can predict certain things about them.

56:19.124 --> 56:25.552
We think that race and color are deterministic biologically.

56:25.572 --> 56:27.555
And that's where we get into infinite trouble.

56:27.535 --> 56:57.407
and it's not so much that it's ignorance I think it's a world of ignorance because a lot of people have always profited from the division into black and white and the further division into superior and inferior and the further division into oppressor and oppressed I mean those all follow from a certain deterministic attitude about race

56:58.518 --> 57:02.322
And when those things come into play, of course, it makes my blood boil.

57:02.683 --> 57:23.547
And often when somebody tries to talk about what's distinctive about my writing, they slip sort of very quietly or maybe even unconsciously from the culture side, something that's interesting and worth studying and worth talking about and accurate, to the race side.

57:23.707 --> 57:26.010
And then it's...

57:27.121 --> 57:37.176
than a pseudoscience and prejudice and perpetuating a kind of racist mentality, an apartheid mentality.

57:37.197 --> 57:43.947
So it's a very crucial set of issues and problems as far as I'm concerned.

57:43.967 --> 57:45.990
And I think they all go back to this...

57:46.274 --> 57:59.710
Confusion, in quotes, between race and culture.
