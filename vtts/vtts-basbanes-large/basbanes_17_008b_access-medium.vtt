00:01.853 --> 00:02.354
Okay.

00:02.514 --> 00:04.897
Have you talked about all these things?

00:05.497 --> 00:10.644
That's what I'm putting in there.

00:10.764 --> 00:27.945
I must emphasize that Mr. Williams, TR as we call them, had a tremendous influence on my outlook

00:28.870 --> 00:36.740
mainly because of the scar on my face, which I considered a hindrance, a liability to me.

00:36.780 --> 00:39.283
And he knocked that out of my system.

00:40.485 --> 00:47.614
And he had faith in me by taking me out at the Y camp and letting me work in the kitchen and be the cook.

00:48.815 --> 00:55.924
And he gave me an attitude that made me feel that I was just as good

00:56.647 --> 01:02.317
or if not better than anybody else of my age in my class.

01:05.423 --> 01:18.587
While I was at the YMCA, my father brought out a man by the name of Mr. Karamidas, I mean the Y camp, who offered me the job.

01:18.922 --> 01:24.247
as a truck driver in 1932 for 10 bucks a week.

01:24.267 --> 01:29.032
So I immediately gave up my job as a cook because it was mid-summer.

01:29.312 --> 01:34.237
And then I worked at that job until 1943.

01:34.437 --> 01:44.727
And it was during that period that I married Georgia and had two sons, and I worked as a driver.

01:46.327 --> 02:14.171
And then when I got out, we lived on Third Street, and it was while living with Georgia and the two kids, after I got out of the service in 1945, wait a minute, 46, and with Georgia constantly pushing me and working with me, we built up a beautiful business.

02:14.231 --> 02:16.333
Today, we have

02:17.984 --> 02:30.099
over 50 people working for us, and it takes in two plants, one in Lowell, one in Hyannis.

02:30.119 --> 02:31.320
So between T.R.

02:31.340 --> 02:43.094
Williams and Gigi, you can call him anything you want, this is why we have a very good life today.

02:44.276 --> 02:46.118
Two good successful sons,

02:46.958 --> 02:53.389
One's a lawyer, one is the literary editor in the Worcester Gazette.

02:54.831 --> 03:05.309
They're on their own, they're doing a beautiful job with their lives, with their family, they're successful, and it makes us feel proud.

03:07.953 --> 03:10.097
I can't think of any other highlights.

03:13.233 --> 03:28.952
I think I overlooked something very important.

03:30.815 --> 03:41.788
When I was going, when I was living up on Worthen Street, shortly after my father took me out of the home, on a Saturday morning,

03:42.106 --> 03:52.159
I used to go up to the gas company on Rock Street with a gig or a sled with empty barrel lap bags and fill them up with coke.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.984
We used to pay like 50 cents a bag.

03:57.826 --> 04:08.160
And then I'd lug it all the way down Rock Street down into the neighborhood that I lived in and sell them to the neighbors for 75 cents.

04:09.922 --> 04:12.045
And I did this every single Saturday.

04:13.038 --> 04:29.358
And at night, like 5 o'clock, after lugging back and forth all day long and taking some of those bags up to the second and third stories of the cold water flats in that area, I'd be as black as a mine worker.

04:30.079 --> 04:39.651
And then I'd go down to the Y at night and shower and scrub that dirt off and go up in the gym and play basketball.

04:40.872 --> 04:42.454
Well, the Y was very, very...

04:43.278 --> 04:56.576
It was my home, and it was very popular in those days because we didn't have the things then that we have today, such as a home, a nice warm home, a TV set.

04:57.958 --> 05:07.170
At the Y, there was competition, there were classes according to the age group, and there was always something.

05:07.190 --> 05:10.855
I used to set up pins in the bowling alleys, work in the checkroom,

05:11.780 --> 05:15.745
And then when I was going to high school, I used to work in the lunchroom.

05:18.368 --> 05:22.893
But always the predominating man in my life was T.R.

05:23.133 --> 05:25.756
Williams, kept an eye on me.

05:28.780 --> 05:34.446
He made sure that I didn't run around the wild kids that were going around in those days.

05:34.967 --> 05:39.272
How many of them went to jail and got into trouble?

05:39.792 --> 05:41.799
And I always stayed out of trouble.

05:42.481 --> 05:47.216
Well, all right, I used to get into a lot of fights, especially the guys that called me Scarface.

05:49.022 --> 05:51.089
But I was more or less a grandstander.

05:51.129 --> 05:52.333
I liked to show off.

05:53.377 --> 05:55.239
And I was looking for the slightest excuse.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.021
I wasn't a wise guy.

05:57.081 --> 05:57.882
I wasn't a bully.

05:58.463 --> 06:00.005
I tried to protect kids.

06:00.766 --> 06:02.508
That's how I met this Andy Dow.

06:03.409 --> 06:08.275
His aunt and his grandmother made him like a Lord Fauntleroy.

06:09.116 --> 06:12.240
And they used to make fun of his little knickers and long curls.

06:13.321 --> 06:15.103
And I'd step in and protect him.

06:16.124 --> 06:17.226
I couldn't get rid of the guy.

06:17.306 --> 06:19.148
He always hung onto me like a leech.

06:20.663 --> 06:32.950
So I didn't want to forget about that experience I had lugging coke from the Lowell Gas Company, and that's why I'm bringing it up now.

06:33.311 --> 06:34.433
I didn't want to overlook that.

06:34.474 --> 06:39.685
It gave me an idea of what it takes to make money.

06:41.065 --> 06:42.426
to be in business more or less.

06:43.287 --> 06:52.635
The only investment I had was a gig or a sled and my broad back, sturdy legs, and a desire to have money in my pocket.

06:52.655 --> 06:54.857
I always wanted to have money in my pocket.

06:55.898 --> 06:58.961
And I didn't want to steal like some of my other friends.

06:58.981 --> 07:01.563
I made it hard.

07:02.925 --> 07:09.030
And I think that that carried over when Georgia and I decided to go on our own.

07:09.432 --> 07:22.172
My old man used to say, Johnny, the thing that talks very loud, the strongest force in the world is money in your pocket, the dollar.

07:22.373 --> 07:25.017
It's the king of kings, he used to say.

07:25.057 --> 07:27.040
And I can see what he means.

07:27.140 --> 07:28.362
I guess that's true today.

07:28.402 --> 07:30.225
If you're broke...

07:31.218 --> 07:35.423
and you're trying to make an important point, people won't listen to you because you're broke.

07:35.783 --> 07:36.304
You're poor.

07:36.404 --> 07:37.365
Why should they listen to you?

07:37.825 --> 07:43.051
But if they think you've got a buck or two, you open up your mouth, you can be absolutely stupid.

07:44.092 --> 07:49.458
They'll listen to you because they think you're something that they can learn from.

07:49.478 --> 07:55.885
Yeah, if I can think of anything else now, I'll put it in later.

07:57.006 --> 07:57.647
Bye now.

07:59.872 --> 08:03.197
I must mention this.

08:03.277 --> 08:04.179
I just thought about it.

08:05.220 --> 08:18.201
You know, one of the most discouraging things in life is for a man to work hard, get a good business built up, and then as the years go by, his sons...

08:19.227 --> 08:21.492
or daughters are interested in it.

08:21.532 --> 08:22.755
That's not the case with me.

08:22.775 --> 08:24.540
I'm very fortunate.

08:25.141 --> 08:28.028
My two sons are interested in the business.

08:28.549 --> 08:33.501
My two granddaughters from George are showing interests in coming into the business.

08:34.263 --> 08:36.949
My son Nicholas does all the

08:38.144 --> 08:45.312
The book work, sends out the bills to the customers, keeps after the delinquents, raises the prices.

08:46.394 --> 08:49.197
Their help is invaluable, and it's encouraging.

08:49.237 --> 09:00.270
It makes me feel that this business can carry on long after I've gone to that great tennis court up in the sky, as Georgie used to say.

09:01.634 --> 09:10.808
So it makes a man feel good when he's done something and he knows that some members of his family are taking an interest.

09:19.782 --> 09:21.144
Another thought just came to me.

09:21.164 --> 09:26.612
I might have mentioned it, but I'll repeat it if I have to.

09:28.364 --> 09:43.647
If you want to succeed in life, you must have a reason why you are aggressive, why you pursue things, what drives you, what makes you so energetic.

09:44.549 --> 09:56.667
Well, I had to prove that in spite of the scar, in spite of losing my mother, in spite of being in the ghetto fighting,

09:58.081 --> 10:01.044
not knowing where your next meal was coming from many times.

10:03.066 --> 10:09.573
You must overcome these things mentally, psychologically.

10:10.194 --> 10:12.737
So I resorted to the YMCA with sports.

10:13.417 --> 10:15.139
That's why I was a pretty good wrestler.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.181
TR wouldn't let me fight.

10:18.363 --> 10:20.625
I was a two-state diving champ.

10:21.606 --> 10:25.270
I was a good swimmer on the swimming team.

10:25.874 --> 10:37.406
I was eight times city champ in tennis, always to prove that I was just as good as anybody that was brought up with a family, a mother, a father, brothers, sisters, cousins, nephews.

10:38.367 --> 10:43.873
I had to prove that a man could be just as good as any one of those kids that had everything.

10:44.954 --> 10:47.416
And I guess I proved it all right, but I couldn't do it alone.

10:48.097 --> 10:50.360
Without Gigi, without T.R.

10:50.380 --> 10:55.645
Williams, without Helen Mansfield, those were the important ones.

10:56.502 --> 11:06.934
Oh yeah, many a time if I had a shine on a certain girl and I went up to talk to her, they'd look at me and they'd sort of shudder a little.

11:07.943 --> 11:10.527
And I would feel so embarrassed.

11:10.567 --> 11:14.253
I said, well, maybe they're looking at me because of this ugly face I have.

11:14.774 --> 11:15.615
But not Gigi.

11:16.236 --> 11:19.741
When she looked at me and said, what an interesting scar you have.

11:20.102 --> 11:23.127
Those are the little things in life that changes one's attitude.

11:23.487 --> 11:24.850
A little remark like that.

11:25.330 --> 11:28.075
What an interesting scar you have on your face.

11:28.716 --> 11:30.578
That's what did it, really.

11:31.740 --> 11:32.121
Okay?

11:33.864 --> 11:34.465
Okay, Leah?

11:35.947 --> 11:36.027
Bye.
