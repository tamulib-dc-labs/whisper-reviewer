WEBVTT

00:02.647 --> 00:04.269
We're taping.

00:05.831 --> 00:11.980
How do we pronounce your... Nunez, because I don't use the tilde.

00:12.361 --> 00:23.116
However, when Spanish-speaking people say Nunez, I don't correct them because that is the Latinas and Spanish-speaking Nunez-Asian.

00:25.159 --> 00:31.928
I guess my first question, and it seems like we're not really discussing the book itself, because that's my job to read it.

00:32.498 --> 00:42.052
But, you know, obviously I'm interested in some of the biography and the work stuff, you know.

00:42.072 --> 00:52.988
I guess I wonder, clearly this could have been a memoir as easily, not as easily, but the decision could have been to write a memoir and not a novel.

00:53.028 --> 01:01.560
And maybe if you could just talk to me about what motivated you to pursue a novel as opposed to a non-fictional account.

01:01.878 --> 01:08.947
Well, I wanted the freedom that you have when you're writing fiction that you really don't have when you're writing nonfiction.

01:09.428 --> 01:22.424
For example, there are large parts of my parents' stories, for example, that I don't know, particularly my father's.

01:22.905 --> 01:30.214
And I wasn't so much interested in doing research or getting the historical facts straight.

01:30.667 --> 01:36.476
I was interested in trying to imagine certain things.

01:36.536 --> 01:56.607
For example, there is a part in the second section of the book called Krista, in which Krista is making her, after the fall of the Nazis, making her way back from her boarding school to her home, which is a four-day walk.

01:59.084 --> 02:03.731
And my mother, this is something that, you know, is based on an event that happened to my mother.

02:03.751 --> 02:04.853
She was there at that time.

02:04.913 --> 02:05.714
She was in school.

02:05.734 --> 02:06.916
She did have to walk home.

02:07.517 --> 02:12.505
And she had a few details about it, but her memory of it was not very good.

02:12.525 --> 02:18.274
It happened a long time ago, and memory is, you know, not the most reliable thing.

02:18.760 --> 02:30.570
But I was very interested in that, and I write many pages of that, imagining what that walk home was like, and what went on in her head, and even what kind of bodily sensations she had.

02:30.590 --> 02:48.126
I mean, there are some non-fiction writers that will simply do that, even the famous people like Ted Kennedy, and say, you know, put thoughts in that person's head in rooms and places where nobody could possibly know what really

02:48.460 --> 02:49.161
Sure.

02:49.761 --> 02:58.229
And that was one of the reasons why I wanted to write it as a novel instead of a memoir.

02:59.150 --> 03:01.111
The freedom to invent, I guess.

03:01.131 --> 03:04.695
The freedom to invent and to change things and to imagine things.

03:04.975 --> 03:16.105
And also, Lewis Begley was asked this question a lot after he wrote Wartime Lies, and he had this great line,

03:16.591 --> 03:34.066
which was, there are some doors that cannot be opened by turning the lock, their opening must be conjured, which is what, and he said that he could not have written that book without the intercession of its form, which was the form of a novel.

03:36.489 --> 03:45.957
I knew, too, that there are things that are, you know, there are deep things that are not accessible

03:46.696 --> 03:49.960
or so accessible without the use of the imagination.

03:51.342 --> 03:59.612
I had a woman come up to me after a reading and say, I would love to write about my own life, but I don't remember.

03:59.632 --> 04:01.935
I'm only 25 years old, and I don't remember anything.

04:01.955 --> 04:06.080
And I said, well, if you started writing, all kinds of things would come back to you.

04:06.440 --> 04:09.725
And she said, I just feel if I did that, I would start inventing.

04:09.765 --> 04:13.009
And I said, yeah, that's how novels are born.

04:13.089 --> 04:15.792
It comes naturally.

04:16.480 --> 04:32.504
You know, there's just material that won't, for whatever reason, I don't really understand why, but there are just certain truths that don't heal themselves so easily unless you use your imagination.

04:32.925 --> 04:40.676
There certainly had to be, I mean, there are some painful things that you write about.

04:40.696 --> 04:45.964
Did you feel that, were there any reticence at all about closing yourself

04:46.838 --> 05:01.175
It was painful in that sense, but I didn't think about it while I was writing it.

05:01.795 --> 05:05.420
I didn't know how far I was going to go.

05:05.480 --> 05:07.642
I didn't know even that I was going to finish it.

05:07.702 --> 05:09.164
You don't really know these things.

05:09.204 --> 05:12.508
I didn't know what I was going to write about next.

05:13.805 --> 05:18.212
As I wrote this, I didn't know that it was going to be published, really.

05:18.232 --> 05:21.417
I mean, a lot of books aren't.

05:22.539 --> 05:25.203
You know, I didn't have a contract for it, for example.

05:25.243 --> 05:27.988
You know, it's just that I didn't even have an agent at the time.

05:28.008 --> 05:30.452
I didn't really think about it.

05:30.872 --> 05:32.695
I just wrote it.

05:32.816 --> 05:38.505
I guess I knew that if I started thinking about that, that was going to restrict me in all kinds of ways.

05:38.525 --> 05:39.787
Did you sell it as a finished book?

05:40.448 --> 05:40.588
Mm-hmm.

05:40.923 --> 05:43.166
So it wasn't even on the basis of a couple of the chapters?

05:43.446 --> 05:54.440
No, except that the first part had been published in a small literary journal, and so had part of the second, in fact, as I was writing it.

05:55.061 --> 05:57.224
But, no, it was finished.

05:57.945 --> 06:04.493
And did those portions remain in the book as they appeared in the literary magazines?

06:04.513 --> 06:06.576
Pretty much, yeah.

06:06.636 --> 06:10.120
I imagine writing a work like this does involve constantly

06:10.741 --> 06:11.622
Rewriting.

06:11.642 --> 06:14.426
Rewriting and rethinking even.

06:15.908 --> 06:16.810
You said a long time?

06:16.850 --> 06:19.714
How long did you work on that book?

06:19.734 --> 06:22.157
Well, I think it took about two years.

06:22.538 --> 06:35.837
There's about two years of writing in the book, but I did that over a four-year period because I wrote the first section and then I stopped and I wrote some stories, one or two stories, and then I wrote the second section.

06:36.644 --> 06:40.910
And then I thought of the possibility of just trying to sell that.

06:40.930 --> 06:45.777
It was about 100 pages, just the first part and the second part.

06:46.518 --> 06:48.000
And I worked on something else.

06:48.321 --> 06:50.604
I took breaks.

06:50.904 --> 06:59.116
This book made it easier for me to do that as a writer because it is four parts.

06:59.136 --> 07:03.883
One critic suggested maybe it's four stories.

07:04.167 --> 07:07.210
Do you agree with that, of course?

07:07.490 --> 07:16.978
Not to forget about that, but a series of short... Well, yeah, it could be, I mean, it could be four separate parts.

07:17.739 --> 07:20.321
I mean, they could be published... Independently.

07:20.401 --> 07:22.583
...separately with some changes.

07:22.623 --> 07:23.964
Perhaps not the last part.

07:24.404 --> 07:25.846
But it is four separate parts.

07:25.866 --> 07:28.408
It's not a traditional novel form by any means.

07:29.889 --> 07:32.752
Now you're working on another novel, I understand.

07:32.772 --> 07:33.212
Yeah, yeah.

07:33.833 --> 07:37.538
Does this also involve autobiographical material?

07:37.558 --> 07:38.339
No, it doesn't.

07:38.980 --> 07:52.437
So would you say that this is, how often do they tell you that the first novel was not only the one you have to deal with and, I hate to say, get out of your system?

07:53.879 --> 07:56.622
But it seems to be true, doesn't it?

07:56.642 --> 07:58.385
It does seem to be true of a lot of writers.

07:58.405 --> 08:01.689
Is there an element of exorcism here?

08:01.709 --> 08:03.351
I think there might be.

08:04.327 --> 08:12.838
I think that it was a, I hate to use this word in connection with writing, but sure, it was a therapeutic experience.

08:13.459 --> 08:29.659
I was dealing with things that had been troubling me and obsessing me in my own life, and I dealt with them in a certain way in this book, and I did feel that I laid some ghosts to rest.

08:30.044 --> 08:33.529
You could have been on the panel yesterday afternoon at the NBCC.

08:33.709 --> 08:57.840
I mean, they had five authors, Linda Grace Sexton, they had Ben Cheever, Michael Gilmore, Scott Peck, not M. Scott Peck, but a gay guy that had abusive... The whole theme here was writing, you know, a spy in the house, writing about... Every one of them,

08:58.732 --> 09:12.409
I mean, dealing with this stuff, and there were questions about the propriety of writing, about, you know, did they feel have any misgivings about writing?

09:12.950 --> 09:18.136
Did you have any misgivings about writing about your family, for instance?

09:18.156 --> 09:27.608
Um, well... And this is just coincidental, but this thing, this seminar that went on for about two hours yesterday, and it actually got a little tedious after a while,

09:27.959 --> 09:32.265
It was interesting that there are elements here.

09:32.905 --> 09:50.688
Well, I had, as I said, I tried not to think about that when I was writing, and I did have a sense when I was writing, or should I say, I never had a sense that I was doing a wrong thing.

09:51.229 --> 09:56.616
I felt that I was doing something difficult, something painful.

09:57.136 --> 09:58.298
But necessary.

09:59.059 --> 10:01.082
Necessary for me.

10:01.883 --> 10:17.807
And there was something so natural feeling and right feeling when I was working on it that I didn't really feel torn.

10:17.867 --> 10:24.717
I felt like I was doing something that I had to do and that was working on its own terms.

10:25.098 --> 10:26.400
I felt like the book

10:27.680 --> 10:55.054
uh was was working and that that was the main thing in the front of my mind i mean i if i had misgivings i i didn't spend a lot of time on them i i just wanted to to get the work done and and i had these goals i wanted this to be as interesting and as beautiful as i could make it and i i'm not in therapy i've really never been in therapy except

10:56.030 --> 10:57.892
by accident, which is a long story.

10:57.912 --> 10:58.833
And I really didn't.

10:59.053 --> 11:00.354
No, no, no, no, no, no.

11:00.374 --> 11:04.579
I just thought it was interesting that you said that, that all four people.

11:04.819 --> 11:08.703
Somebody from the audience asked that question, and it was amazing.

11:08.823 --> 11:10.345
It wasn't amazing, yeah.

11:10.745 --> 11:12.107
Of course, yeah.

11:12.127 --> 11:14.269
Michael Dolmore had been in therapy for 20 years.

11:14.289 --> 11:14.569
I know.

11:14.589 --> 11:17.612
This young kid, he said, well, all right, I'm just starting now.

11:17.913 --> 11:20.215
I mean, it was amazing, and they were talking about

11:20.532 --> 11:23.816
I guess they all felt that they profited from it.

11:23.916 --> 11:24.797
Oh, I think so.

11:24.917 --> 11:26.699
Well, most people I know have been in therapy.

11:26.739 --> 11:31.544
That's why I actually mention it, because it's unusual.

11:31.665 --> 11:34.187
I mean, there does seem to be some pathology here.

11:34.328 --> 11:35.068
That's what I mean.

11:35.129 --> 11:35.929
Exactly.

11:36.070 --> 11:36.570
Exactly.

11:36.790 --> 11:41.015
I mean, if it were a shrink looking at it, the shrink, of course, would say, well, you need therapy.

11:41.055 --> 11:42.557
The shrink would say that to everybody.

11:42.657 --> 11:47.102
I mean, you really have some difficult things to work with here.

11:47.162 --> 11:47.923
Absolutely.

11:48.140 --> 11:53.630
Well, that's why I bring it up, because I think it's interesting that I'm not, I'm against therapy.

11:53.971 --> 11:59.160
I'm one of those people who actually don't believe in it, and I'm not interested in it.

11:59.681 --> 12:00.723
Great.

12:00.743 --> 12:01.304
I agree.

12:01.324 --> 12:01.805
It's unusual.

12:01.825 --> 12:02.467
It's unusual.

12:02.487 --> 12:08.157
I mean, most of my friends... Well, I think you've worked through your own... Of course, there's a question here about maybe something else.

12:08.474 --> 12:11.657
could have helped some of these characters make the right choice.

12:11.677 --> 12:11.837
Exactly.

12:11.857 --> 12:15.701
Because there were a lot of really stupid choices being made by people.

12:15.801 --> 12:16.262
Exactly.

12:16.662 --> 12:18.324
Bad choices is probably the better word.

12:18.344 --> 12:19.565
Bad choices.

12:19.585 --> 12:22.568
Bad choices, but I mean, that's a theme in the book.

12:22.648 --> 12:30.816
I feel that, to some extent, some of these choices, there was no choice.

12:32.177 --> 12:36.201
That's a point where I talk about... That's almost an oxymoron, isn't it?

12:36.221 --> 12:37.502
A choice almost means...

12:38.410 --> 12:39.011
Right.

12:39.111 --> 12:40.693
Having the option to select various courses.

12:41.394 --> 12:41.794
Right.

12:41.994 --> 13:01.297
I guess there's a part when I'm talking about the narrator talks about Christa, her mother, imagining her after the fall of Germany, and then meeting Chang and so on, and getting pregnant, and then ending up in a Brooklyn housing project.

13:01.958 --> 13:04.401
She's been a divorced one, though.

13:04.567 --> 13:06.710
She could have divorced him, but she couldn't.

13:06.930 --> 13:10.875
But the thing is that, you know, she was very, very young.

13:11.255 --> 13:12.437
She was still a teenager.

13:12.457 --> 13:14.560
She was a young woman, too, in fact.

13:14.580 --> 13:15.521
In her 40s, yeah.

13:15.541 --> 13:17.283
But she was a teenager at the time.

13:17.323 --> 13:19.125
That's young.

13:19.145 --> 13:20.928
Younger than I am.

13:22.149 --> 13:23.191
I'm sorry, go ahead.

13:23.251 --> 13:32.262
No, I was just saying that there's a part where the narrator says a family more incurred

13:32.748 --> 13:35.011
chosen, for there had been no choice.

13:35.511 --> 13:43.521
I wonder if, as opposed to, I have here, lost and missed opportunities, whether or not it's a choice or a missed opportunity, I wonder if it's almost the same thing.

13:45.143 --> 13:56.156
Yeah, I guess I'm curious about how, I'm probably more likely to see that there are, that people have fewer choices than some people might think.

13:56.677 --> 14:01.202
I'm interested in that because I grew up in a housing project when

14:01.587 --> 14:04.410
Although there were all kinds of problems, there was a point in my life.

14:04.530 --> 14:06.572
And tell me where the housing project was.

14:06.592 --> 14:07.673
Oh, it was on Staten Island.

14:07.733 --> 14:11.837
People keep saying in interviews and places that I was raised in Brooklyn and I was not.

14:11.857 --> 14:13.318
I was raised in Staten Island.

14:13.338 --> 14:13.999
Why do they say that?

14:14.099 --> 14:18.443
It's in the book, and everybody assumes that everything in the book is reality.

14:18.603 --> 14:24.388
So I just read about that housing project, the Mariners Harbor Houses, and that, you know, now it's terrible.

14:24.408 --> 14:26.030
I always take a book for what it is.

14:26.050 --> 14:28.152
I mean, it would not occur to me that

14:28.537 --> 14:32.464
Everything in the book is... Well, it's ridiculous, I mean, because you are inventing things.

14:32.865 --> 14:33.506
Exactly.

14:34.007 --> 14:34.989
Exactly.

14:35.009 --> 14:38.977
Yeah, it's caused a lot of confusion in front of me.

14:38.997 --> 14:43.165
I hate assumptions, to assume that you were a book.

14:43.185 --> 14:44.187
Right.

14:45.750 --> 14:45.870
Right.

14:46.002 --> 14:47.383
I think you should know where it is.

14:47.403 --> 14:48.364
Exactly.

14:48.384 --> 14:50.527
Put it in print.

14:50.707 --> 14:53.630
You're going to be plagued with this now for years to come.

14:53.650 --> 14:54.391
I'm sorry to say.

14:54.411 --> 14:54.931
It's true.

14:55.292 --> 14:55.772
It's true.

14:55.992 --> 14:57.434
No, I know it's true.

14:57.454 --> 15:00.977
I think Charlotte said, history repeats itself, but historians repeat one another.

15:04.221 --> 15:04.781
Very good.

15:04.962 --> 15:15.132
Well, in this question of choices, as I said, growing up in the project, at a certain point in my young life, I felt as if I were someone who was

15:15.550 --> 15:17.553
being showered with opportunities.

15:18.113 --> 15:22.258
I mean, there were progressive programs in school.

15:24.041 --> 15:28.006
You know, there was money to be had to go to an Ivy League college.

15:28.687 --> 15:33.252
And it wasn't like I had to kill myself to go find these opportunities.

15:33.332 --> 15:39.280
My advisors and my teachers told me about them, arranged them for me, helped me.

15:39.597 --> 15:40.779
I think about this now.

15:40.839 --> 15:49.673
If I had been born 10, 15, 20 years later and been in one of these housing projects, I mean, what choices would I have?

15:50.034 --> 15:54.962
I don't know that these people have... Well, they certainly don't have the choices I had.

15:55.162 --> 16:03.816
I mean, because if you're born into a situation where you have to sleep under the bed because there's so much gunfire,

16:04.707 --> 16:07.530
and where the drug problem is what it is, and so on.

16:07.550 --> 16:09.512
I mean, you don't have, that's not what I had.

16:09.672 --> 16:12.555
I mean, I was just in a housing project.

16:12.595 --> 16:14.957
There was still some dignity to be had.

16:14.977 --> 16:28.090
And incidentally, Staten Island, even today, I just read a piece of the Times, well, there is, guess what, there's a little crime out in Staten Island now, but even then, it's still by far the safest of all the boroughs.

16:28.170 --> 16:28.651
Right.

16:28.671 --> 16:30.192
I'm sure that when you were a child, it was,

16:30.695 --> 16:32.136
that much safer still.

16:32.417 --> 16:35.500
Yeah, I mean, things happen, but I, nothing like it.

16:35.520 --> 16:43.448
I mean, I had the situation where I had friends from school whose parents would not allow them to visit me because they were afraid.

16:44.068 --> 16:45.990
But that was more fear than reality.

16:46.311 --> 16:50.195
Now, of course, it would be reality.

16:50.215 --> 16:53.538
So that's just on this question of choices.

16:54.719 --> 17:00.685
You know, all these people are going to the projects, making movies and writing books like Coop Dreams and so on.

17:01.306 --> 17:05.652
as if that were the only kind of dreams in the project, to play basketball.

17:05.672 --> 17:17.728
I mean, there are people there who would like to write and do other things and become historians or scientists or something, but will they ever have anything like that opportunity?

17:17.829 --> 17:21.133
I don't know anymore.

17:21.153 --> 17:22.074
It looks like not.

17:22.114 --> 17:22.835
It's terrifying.

17:23.236 --> 17:24.738
Now you're working on a second book.

17:25.319 --> 17:27.702
Is this being narrated just out of curiosity?

17:28.492 --> 17:30.574
Does it have a narrator?

17:30.834 --> 17:31.775
This has a third.

17:32.236 --> 17:36.780
This book, the second book, is more traditional than this in form.

17:36.920 --> 17:38.401
It's in the third person.

17:39.142 --> 17:50.132
So it has a third-person narrator and a cast of characters not based on myself or my family.

17:50.272 --> 17:55.157
So this should be the challenge in terms of establishing a voice for you.

17:55.492 --> 17:58.977
Yeah, I think that... This voice must be your voice here.

17:59.238 --> 18:09.714
It's completely different, you know, because... I mean, is this voice, that's an assumption I'm making, the voice in this book is... I think it is.

18:09.754 --> 18:12.819
Again, I didn't think about that when I was writing.

18:12.919 --> 18:21.212
I have gotten letters from people whom I have been out of touch with for a very long time who were...

18:22.373 --> 18:26.356
startled to come across the book and read it and recognize my voice.

18:26.757 --> 18:28.678
They did recognize you.

18:28.698 --> 18:29.519
Yes, they did.

18:29.539 --> 18:31.201
And other people have said that, too.

18:31.581 --> 18:35.244
I'm not sure what that means, because it's obviously not my speaking voice.

18:35.264 --> 18:45.032
If it's my literary voice, it shouldn't really, it wouldn't necessarily change just because you went from a first-person narrator to a third-person narrator.

18:45.052 --> 18:51.638
Yeah, but I think that, you know, you're the person who, this is your creative process, not mine, and I'm just

18:52.192 --> 19:03.084
try to get a glimpse of it, but when you were writing this book, I mean, did this person assume her own voice for you?

19:03.424 --> 19:06.448
How did you move outside yourself, I wonder?

19:06.468 --> 19:06.908
Or did you?

19:08.049 --> 19:08.390
I did.

19:08.510 --> 19:14.937
There is, I mean, when you read the book, you can see a distance, a distance that the writer has from the narrator.

19:15.878 --> 19:22.165
Part of that is that the narrator is someone who's looking back, too.

19:22.499 --> 19:43.238
But I myself am very curious about that, whether if someone were to pick up the second book without seeing a name, if they would recognize, if they would, or both of these books, if they would compare and say, yes, I do believe these books were written by the same person.

19:44.480 --> 19:46.043
For example, you pick anything.

19:46.208 --> 19:48.710
by Virginia Woolf or her memoir.

19:48.730 --> 19:49.591
Can I just give you a second?

19:49.611 --> 19:50.131
It's a cute story.

19:50.211 --> 19:57.217
I did an interview with Doris Lessing here in New York, and she wrote a couple of books under another name.

19:57.398 --> 20:15.473
In fact, this house, I guess, was HarperCollins, and just to see, to see how it would, first of all, it could be sold without, I mean, she scrupulously kept her anonymity, and it was published, and went out, and I forget the name of the author,

20:16.145 --> 20:21.553
But to read the reviews, she says, one person finally said, reads like a young Doris Lessing.

20:21.573 --> 20:21.953
That's wonderful.

20:21.973 --> 20:22.814
That was great.

20:22.834 --> 20:23.155
That's good.

20:23.175 --> 20:25.759
But one person picked it up, you know.

20:25.779 --> 20:41.961
Well, it's interesting, because I guess it depends on how strong or distinctive the literary voice is, because if you picked up any piece of fiction or nonfiction, memoir, letter, et cetera, you'd recognize Virginia Woolf.

20:42.502 --> 20:43.103
I think so.

20:43.123 --> 20:46.067
You will recognize that.

20:46.418 --> 20:51.586
I guess it's not true of everybody who certainly recognized a priest anywhere, I think.

20:51.626 --> 20:58.055
So it wouldn't... Maybe for the French there might be a different story.

20:58.156 --> 21:10.134
So I don't know if... That's why I said I'm not sure if the voice is so different in this second, more traditional, third-person narrated book than this.

21:10.494 --> 21:12.477
It may be very much the same voice.

21:12.946 --> 21:19.413
When you envisioned the novel, was it a novel about people or about experiences that you first... This novel?

21:19.433 --> 21:20.474
Yes.

21:22.156 --> 21:27.102
It was largely about observation, really.

21:28.664 --> 21:33.649
Because, I mean, that's, you know, this is not a plot-driven novel.

21:33.829 --> 21:38.274
This is a novel about an eye, capital I, as well as E-Y-E.

21:40.757 --> 21:42.379
You know, somebody looking back,

21:42.950 --> 21:54.183
at this childhood and hearing stories about other people's lives and interpreting them or getting them down.

21:56.806 --> 22:07.437
So I really see it as a narrator who is seeing things and getting them down.

22:08.359 --> 22:12.383
More than a story of her experiences.

22:12.785 --> 22:27.419
A couple of reviews of these novels, I don't know if they're classified as any kind of a genre, but the immigrant story, how do you feel about it being perceived in that sense of a stereotype?

22:27.439 --> 22:34.445
Well, I think it is, to some extent, I mean, there are three characters.

22:34.605 --> 22:37.308
All of them are immigrants.

22:37.648 --> 22:41.832
That's quite a disparate.

22:41.872 --> 22:42.032
Exactly.

22:42.569 --> 23:12.508
experiences are immigrant experiences so um you know of course people are going to to um to point to that but i i don't think of it as an immigrant novel i mean i guess partly because the the narrator is not an immigrant um and um you know i see it more as a as a book that deals with themes of nostalgia and loss and memory which are

23:13.197 --> 23:17.602
and when he wrote about it, he wasn't talking about immigrants at all.

23:18.303 --> 23:19.204
It was about loss.

23:22.527 --> 23:26.031
James Merrill, who just died, the great poet of love and loss.

23:26.552 --> 23:27.573
He's been called everywhere.

23:27.613 --> 23:29.995
He's not an immigrant.

23:30.576 --> 23:37.423
These are themes that are related to the immigrant experience, but are actually universal experience.

23:37.684 --> 23:40.707
I think it's very important to point out that an American

23:41.598 --> 23:52.670
That's one of the great duties of American literature is that there are so many different aspects and voices and experiences to write about.

23:54.952 --> 24:09.327
The question of language is important, too, and, of course, it's an immigrant novel in that sense that one of the themes is coming from a different language.

24:09.475 --> 24:15.023
also a meditation on the power of art, isn't it?

24:16.465 --> 24:16.766
Yes.

24:16.926 --> 24:18.749
Might talk a little bit about that.

24:19.910 --> 24:25.919
Of course, you know, and which feeds us into the title piece, too, you know.

24:26.420 --> 24:26.660
Mm-hmm.

24:27.922 --> 24:29.064
Well, yeah.

24:29.124 --> 24:31.027
Just take it anywhere you want, I'm sure.

24:31.047 --> 24:36.715
Well, one of the most important things about the narrator is

24:37.370 --> 24:45.761
And what we learn about her in the book is how important reading was to her and how she used books.

24:45.781 --> 25:00.441
She talks about the books that were given to her by her mother, first fairy tales and then Greek myths, and how she found a whole world there and how much her reading formed her character.

25:00.481 --> 25:05.368
Then at a certain point, she decides to study ballet.

25:05.872 --> 25:08.455
And, I mean, that's a whole section of the book.

25:09.337 --> 25:10.999
Is this true ballet?

25:11.319 --> 25:20.171
I've studied ballet enough to write about it, but it wasn't just, I mean, it wasn't that big of a... Well, it was, but just for a little while.

25:20.211 --> 25:24.136
And certainly I didn't have any possibility of a career there.

25:26.399 --> 25:30.985
But she, in the beginning of that section, she talks about being...

25:32.450 --> 25:33.812
so passionate about it.

25:33.832 --> 25:38.358
And she says, well, now I can describe exactly what it was that was happening to me.

25:38.518 --> 25:56.501
I had discovered a way of being out of the world and being, as she calls it, the miraculous possibility that art holds out to us to be a part of the world and to be removed from the world at the same time.

25:57.081 --> 25:59.925
And recently I was looking at a letter to

26:00.395 --> 26:22.291
Flannery O'Connor that I'd read a long time ago, and they came out, and I had marked a place there I saw where she said in a letter, I never feel more, this is a very rough paraphrase, I never feel more like myself when I'm writing, and I never feel more removed from myself when I'm writing.

26:23.052 --> 26:27.499
And that's saying the same thing, and then I came across a Goethe quote that said,

26:28.357 --> 26:34.263
The safest way to be in the world.

26:34.943 --> 26:38.847
Art is the safest way to be in the world and out of the world at the same time.

26:38.887 --> 26:40.669
So these are all the same idea.

26:40.729 --> 26:43.832
And that's something that's very important to the narrator.

26:44.252 --> 26:55.343
That is what being passionate about ballet and being a dancer studying the discipline and the involvement does for her.

26:56.403 --> 27:02.508
So, yeah, that, the consolation of art, the, the, I know, it's just of hard work as well.

27:03.710 --> 27:07.253
Were you tempted at all to give her a name, or are you more comfortable with her?

27:07.693 --> 27:12.317
Well, that's actually, that's an interesting thing, because I never, that's something else I didn't think about.

27:12.377 --> 27:25.549
I started writing with the, with the I in the first person, and there are actually a lot of first person books wherein the narrator is not named, and maybe for the same reason as what happened to me.

27:25.985 --> 27:29.189
I finished writing and had never named her.

27:29.230 --> 27:37.181
There had never come a place in the book where somebody said, hey, you, you know what I mean?

27:37.681 --> 27:41.747
Or where there was any natural place to insert a name.

27:42.768 --> 27:46.434
And then when it was finished and I realized that she didn't have a name, it didn't bother me.

27:46.674 --> 27:54.625
I didn't want to go back and find a place because, of course, I only would have found, I mean, just to insert it one time, the reader probably would have forgotten the name.

27:55.178 --> 27:58.762
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

27:59.283 --> 28:01.505
What's the name of Hamlet's father?

28:01.525 --> 28:02.146
Exactly.

28:02.546 --> 28:07.432
What is the name of the narrator in A Feather on the Breath of God?

28:09.173 --> 28:12.837
So the point is that we really shouldn't draw anything from it.

28:13.178 --> 28:17.322
No, it's just the way it happens.

28:17.543 --> 28:23.329
And then it didn't bother me and I didn't want to go back and plant it.

28:24.001 --> 28:26.223
I thought there might have been some... Right.

28:26.643 --> 28:32.248
But no, I didn't plan it.

28:34.270 --> 28:34.670
Let's see.

28:34.690 --> 28:38.514
As you said, you have done some, quite a few short stories.

28:39.474 --> 28:42.677
In which form?

28:42.877 --> 28:46.220
I mean, is your next novel going to be a longer novel, do you think?

28:46.240 --> 28:47.401
It is going to be longer.

28:47.541 --> 28:51.905
It's going to be at least 300 pages, at least 100 pages longer than that.

28:51.925 --> 28:53.907
Book pages, is it?

28:54.612 --> 28:55.613
Well, I'm not sure.

28:56.094 --> 28:56.354
No.

28:58.698 --> 28:58.978
Both.

29:00.480 --> 29:00.680
Both.

29:00.740 --> 29:03.845
It's already, I was about halfway through with it.

29:05.126 --> 29:09.172
And it's already, you know, almost as long as this now.

29:11.295 --> 29:13.958
There's a line, a household where hate predominates.

29:13.978 --> 29:16.262
I don't know where I pulled that from.

29:16.422 --> 29:17.383
I don't remember either.

29:17.403 --> 29:19.065
That was in one of the reviews.

29:19.085 --> 29:19.606
Did you see that?

29:20.027 --> 29:23.151
I think, you know, I have a funny thing about the reviews.

29:23.907 --> 29:25.850
they make me very nervous.

29:26.190 --> 29:31.056
I mean, even when they're good, they're often full of mistakes and misquote.

29:31.737 --> 29:35.462
It doesn't bother me as much as I thought it would, but it's a problem.

29:35.482 --> 29:37.224
It's a problem with me, too, I think.

29:37.244 --> 29:40.028
Yeah, so particularly when they misquote you, the writer.

29:40.488 --> 29:47.577
So what I do is I tend to read them like this, nervously, like as if I were expecting bad news.

29:47.598 --> 29:49.520
I think that's misreading the book, honestly.

29:49.780 --> 29:50.381
I do, too.

29:50.401 --> 29:53.425
So what I do is I... I don't really like to talk about other...

29:54.029 --> 30:23.091
the reviewers have to say, but it is... I thought it was a misreading, and also that's interesting because when I did a radio interview with Lenny Lopate, the last thing he said to me was, this is a very, which has also been said, this is a very loving book, a book written with a lot of love, and I'm just wondering, he said, isn't honesty a higher virtue than...

30:23.510 --> 30:48.792
forgiveness which is an interesting question for which i didn't really have much of an answer but but you thought about it well i don't i don't think i don't know what it means in in connection with the book it didn't seem to me he was talking about the book i don't i mean i yeah so so the point is that that um yeah a household where hate predominated it's it's too it's

30:49.565 --> 30:50.846
It jumped out at me.

30:51.347 --> 30:54.170
It was up towards the lead of the review, too, I think.

30:54.570 --> 30:58.914
Yeah, I wouldn't say that that was accurate.

31:01.076 --> 31:01.176
Good.

31:01.236 --> 31:03.338
Why did you say that?

31:04.740 --> 31:06.642
Was your childhood an unhappy childhood?

31:07.483 --> 31:12.728
I don't think I would characterize it as unhappy.

31:13.108 --> 31:14.309
It was troubled.

31:15.450 --> 31:19.234
It depends on whether I'm comparing it to other people's childhood.

31:19.957 --> 31:23.400
I was not a depressed child.

31:23.480 --> 31:27.944
I was pretty outgoing, and I loved things.

31:28.665 --> 31:31.367
You know, I was interested in things.

31:31.507 --> 31:32.708
I had little friends.

31:32.828 --> 31:33.749
I liked adults.

31:33.769 --> 31:34.770
I liked children.

31:34.790 --> 31:39.814
I was troubled, and I think that that was clear to anybody.

31:39.834 --> 31:40.775
In fact, I know it was.

31:40.875 --> 31:43.077
It shows up on school reports.

31:46.220 --> 31:47.200
I worried people.

31:47.461 --> 31:49.002
Did you look up your own school reports?

31:49.370 --> 31:50.231
I haven't.

31:50.271 --> 31:52.174
I don't have them with me, but I remember them.

31:52.214 --> 31:56.621
And I know that people were concerned about me.

31:56.701 --> 32:03.051
But there was so much, I mean, I had a great deal of curiosity about the world and a lot that I wanted to do.

32:03.151 --> 32:07.237
I wasn't withdrawn, and I think that that's the difference.

32:07.257 --> 32:13.386
You know, there's nothing worse than that depressed, withdrawn child who then grows up and remembers a child that is this

32:14.142 --> 32:19.029
endless nightmare, because there's nothing to relieve it, whereas I got involved in such.

32:19.069 --> 32:40.862
This one kid was saying how he ran across a photograph of his mother and his aunt, and they were married to brothers, and you remember the two of them when he was a kid talking about how they were both beaten up, you know, at the same time, and comparing wounds and scars, you know, and a little small look at this one, look at that one.

32:40.882 --> 32:42.124
It was a bizarre kind of a thing.

32:43.150 --> 32:45.633
his recollection of this.

32:45.653 --> 32:46.875
Like Michael Gilmour.

32:47.015 --> 32:47.596
Exactly, yeah.

32:47.616 --> 32:48.257
Yeah.

32:48.277 --> 32:53.443
Yeah, I mean, there's so much that you hear about, it's worse.

32:53.464 --> 32:56.187
He said, whoever said the truth shall set you free.

32:56.207 --> 32:58.911
He said, God wrong.

32:58.931 --> 33:00.613
And the truth does not set you free.

33:00.633 --> 33:04.798
It was a very interesting quote that he made, you know.

33:04.899 --> 33:07.622
Yeah.

33:07.722 --> 33:08.223
Oh, absolutely.

33:08.363 --> 33:10.626
Yeah, I remember reading a

33:11.450 --> 33:13.572
Well, reading reviews of the book.

33:13.632 --> 33:14.193
Yeah.

33:14.333 --> 33:19.938
No, I think it's... It's good, because it wasn't... And yours, and I think we can say the same thing about your book.

33:21.319 --> 33:23.041
Of course, his is a memoir, and yours is a novel.

33:23.061 --> 33:24.702
But it's not exploitive.

33:24.722 --> 33:31.909
I mean, it's not... You're not exploiting anything for the... No, no.

33:32.229 --> 33:34.712
You're using it to produce it.

33:34.732 --> 33:38.115
Well, I think that's what I meant before when I said that I wasn't...

33:39.142 --> 33:44.647
I didn't have those kinds of misgivings when I was writing, that I was doing something wrong.

33:44.687 --> 33:48.351
I guess if I had felt that I was doing something exploitive.

33:49.832 --> 33:52.475
But I was sure that I wasn't.

33:55.398 --> 34:01.383
But I don't remember what your last question was or where we were.

34:01.684 --> 34:07.309
Well, you mentioned that you read voraciously as a child, I guess.

34:07.846 --> 34:13.935
I've written a book about the passion for books, by the coming out of some book madness.

34:13.955 --> 34:21.806
I'm always interested to hear about people who are passionate about books at a young age.

34:21.826 --> 34:28.296
Do I assume that this probably led to your becoming or deciding to be a writer of fiction?

34:28.536 --> 34:31.120
I think so, because I wanted to...

34:31.724 --> 34:33.466
This is what I mean about opportunities.

34:33.566 --> 34:51.382
When I was only in sixth grade, on my way to junior high school, at Public School 44 in Staten Island, which was a poor public school, we had a real graduation, and everybody dressed up and so on, and we got awards.

34:52.222 --> 35:00.870
Somebody went and had little trophies made up, math awards, history awards, you know, these things that, of course, you have in high school, medals or whatever.

35:01.390 --> 35:03.934
And I can still remember everything.

35:03.974 --> 35:05.997
There was a major event this graduation.

35:06.057 --> 35:06.678
I remember it very well.

35:06.698 --> 35:07.619
I remember what I was wearing.

35:07.639 --> 35:13.047
I remember the fact that I woke up at the crack of dawn out of excitement, looking forward to this.

35:13.067 --> 35:15.130
I mean, do they even do these things anymore for children?

35:15.550 --> 35:17.693
And I got the Creative Writing Award.

35:17.713 --> 35:18.514
Oh, that's great.

35:19.376 --> 35:19.476
Yeah.

35:19.636 --> 35:20.717
But I mean, in the project.

35:20.737 --> 35:23.261
I mean, did anything like this happen in the project?

35:23.682 --> 35:27.487
So if I got this little Creative Writing Award... Oh, I forget when I go to school.

35:27.507 --> 35:28.849
I think...

35:29.065 --> 35:38.678
This little creative writing shows that I was already, I mean, that was already something that I was doing, and it had to have been in imitation.

35:38.718 --> 35:52.737
I mean, you don't just do creative writing as a fifth or fourth grader or whatever without copying some creative writing that your teacher or parents are giving you.

35:53.718 --> 35:55.360
So I guess I was...

35:56.487 --> 36:03.719
I was like, I can remember, in fact, I don't guess, but I was a, I thought of myself as a children's book writer.

36:04.861 --> 36:07.605
And I received another award.

36:07.966 --> 36:10.490
I did, I remember that I was writing for children.

36:10.870 --> 36:14.857
That's what, my idea was that I would be a writer for children.

36:15.458 --> 36:22.309
And when I received another award, the principal had written on slide inside for our own doctor's suit.

36:23.707 --> 36:25.449
See, these things mean so much.

36:25.809 --> 36:28.191
They really, really mean everything.

36:28.411 --> 36:31.834
See, and I remember those so much that I don't remember, but this I do.

36:32.655 --> 36:43.265
So that tells me that I must have been writing, reading and loving Dr. Seuss, which I remember, and then writing my own Seussian, which I would still love to do.

36:43.946 --> 36:45.487
Children's work.

36:45.507 --> 36:46.108
I love children.

36:46.148 --> 36:48.029
Particularly along the lines of Dr. Seuss.

36:48.049 --> 36:50.231
It seems like great zany fun to me.

36:50.251 --> 36:50.912
I love children.

36:51.196 --> 36:55.421
So my wife and I actually had hundreds of them before we even had kids.

36:55.441 --> 36:56.663
Yeah, they're wonderful.

36:56.683 --> 37:01.148
I mean, we have some wonderful, like Natalie Babbitt and some wonderful writers.

37:02.009 --> 37:04.232
So I think that's the way I thought of myself.

37:04.252 --> 37:08.377
When I got older, I thought of myself as a different kind of writer.

37:08.397 --> 37:11.040
But even, you know, I did take the ballet break there.

37:11.060 --> 37:13.563
It was a period of time where that was all I was interested in.

37:13.583 --> 37:19.110
But I was so old already in high school for a dancer, so old.

37:20.575 --> 37:26.821
So, you know, and then when I got to junior high school, high school, I was writing.

37:26.841 --> 37:31.725
And in college, I majored in English, but I studied writing there.

37:31.745 --> 37:31.945
Which one?

37:32.165 --> 37:32.546
Barnard.

37:33.366 --> 37:36.950
And then I went to the Columbia School of the Arts for my M.S.A.

37:39.752 --> 37:42.415
So, yeah, I mean, I thought it was just been pretty clear to me.

37:42.455 --> 37:44.797
You worked at the New York University?

37:44.817 --> 37:45.838
I worked at the Review.

37:46.338 --> 37:48.540
I was Robert Silver's secretary.

37:50.174 --> 37:53.899
Editorial assistant, I suppose, is what everybody calls it.

37:53.919 --> 37:55.782
Nobody says secretary anymore, but that's what I was.

37:55.802 --> 38:08.321
I was one of his secretaries for a couple of years in the 70s, before and right out of college, and then off and on when I was in graduate school.

38:09.362 --> 38:14.590
Yeah, it was actually my first job out of college, working at the Reviews.

38:14.610 --> 38:16.412
I don't know if you're going to be a writer or not.

38:16.953 --> 38:19.557
Yeah, really, it was so much going on.

38:20.110 --> 38:29.598
to absorb things, I guess, and pick up the ambiance, and I guess Elizabeth Hardwick was kind of a... she encouraged you, right?

38:29.858 --> 38:31.820
Yeah, well, she got me the job.

38:31.940 --> 38:50.016
I mean, she was my teacher at Barnett at the end, and I said, well, I'm going out to find a job, and she suggested that I call Whitney Ellsworth, the publisher, and they didn't have anything of that kind, but then someone left, and I took her play.

38:50.772 --> 39:03.868
But one of the things about the review is that I learned about all kinds of writers that I'd never come across in college.

39:03.888 --> 39:08.895
I mean, very well-known writers, people who write regularly for the journal.

39:14.482 --> 39:14.582
Okay.

39:14.602 --> 39:18.687
I think we've cut a lot of ground, by the way.

39:21.029 --> 39:25.533
I mean, you definitely would not want to be Catholic.

39:25.573 --> 39:36.704
Somebody says, I think maybe there was even an interview with you, in fact, with Stan Cryer, but somebody suggested that you were an ethnic writer, or that you were, did you see that?

39:36.724 --> 39:43.211
Oh, yeah, they, yeah, I mean, I don't think of myself as an ethnic writer if, I mean, yeah, I don't.

39:43.251 --> 39:47.475
And I also don't identify myself the way other people do.

39:48.063 --> 39:56.251
I mean, if both of my parents had been Chinese, yeah, I would think of myself as a Chinese-American.

39:56.271 --> 40:07.222
I mean, if I spoke that language, if they spoke that language, and... Yeah, I mean, it's... Yeah, and so is Amy Tan, and... But that's impossible for me.

40:07.262 --> 40:10.345
Now, I'm certainly not going to think of myself as a German-American writer.

40:10.385 --> 40:15.630
That's out of the question, and I'm not a Latino, Latina writer.

40:15.650 --> 40:17.192
So, the one thing in the...

40:17.729 --> 40:22.416
was that I had said something about how these things, maybe for me, they cancel each other out.

40:23.077 --> 40:25.561
So I don't think of myself as an ethnic writer.

40:25.701 --> 40:32.511
I don't really think of myself as an ethnic person, but other people do, and that's understandable.

40:32.552 --> 40:35.376
You know, this kind of mix, it doesn't work the same way.

40:36.998 --> 40:40.824
Bohorti Muguchi.

40:40.844 --> 40:43.608
I interviewed her for about a year and a half.

40:43.628 --> 40:44.089
Wonderful.

40:45.451 --> 40:46.032
Interesting.

40:46.366 --> 40:50.570
And she's gone through an interesting kind of a, she was a perfect choice, I thought.

40:50.950 --> 40:58.597
If I were reciting that book, you know, and I had the ability to, you know, I'd always say she'd be perfect for this book.

40:59.318 --> 41:00.218
Interesting.

41:00.298 --> 41:05.703
And she, in my interview with her, was very adamant, I'm an American writer.

41:05.723 --> 41:06.064
Yeah.

41:07.645 --> 41:09.006
Please don't call me this or that.

41:09.126 --> 41:15.512
But I said, well, can you publish her then, not to put out the photograph of you wearing the saris, you know what?

41:15.712 --> 41:17.614
That's a little misleading.

41:17.634 --> 41:18.896
That's a little misleading.

41:18.916 --> 41:19.837
Have you seen the picture?

41:22.040 --> 41:24.222
That's a very, very good answer.

41:24.302 --> 41:34.554
Well, in fact, I have to say, though, I don't think it was fair that somebody interviewed me, and I said this, well, I don't think of myself as an ethnic writer, and she said, well, then why is your publisher promoting you that way?

41:34.574 --> 41:37.097
And I said, oh, I don't think that's fair.

41:37.117 --> 41:38.179
I don't think they are, really.

41:38.199 --> 41:41.162
Well, they do make the character with Amy Tan, though.

41:41.443 --> 41:43.525
I have to say, in one of their press releases, they do

41:44.332 --> 41:48.076
You know, if they make a comparison, they do make an Amy Tan comparison.

41:48.597 --> 41:48.717
Right.

41:48.737 --> 41:52.781
But, you know, but publishers are famous for that.

41:53.262 --> 41:53.662
Right.

41:53.782 --> 41:56.465
And I felt that it was a little bit unfair of her.

41:56.526 --> 42:00.029
I wouldn't say that HarperCollins has been promoting me.

42:00.049 --> 42:02.973
They've been promoting me as a first novelist, if anything.

42:03.173 --> 42:13.464
Which is great, in a way, because one of the things that came out yesterday, even like Gail Colbo of The Globe, you know, what things do you review and not review?

42:13.484 --> 42:14.085
And she said, well,

42:14.690 --> 42:18.795
we really have a mission to do first novels, because if we don't do it, who is?

42:18.815 --> 42:19.396
Right.

42:19.416 --> 42:19.937
It's true.

42:20.057 --> 42:22.560
And I'm so, I love Gail anyway.

42:22.580 --> 42:26.365
It's kind of a, it's a great position to have.

42:26.526 --> 42:26.926
It is.

42:27.146 --> 42:27.627
You have to.

42:27.647 --> 42:33.014
It's easy to review somebody when they become, uh, Anne Tyler.

42:33.094 --> 42:34.436
Anne Tyler is Anne Tyler.

42:34.957 --> 42:35.157
Yeah.

42:35.397 --> 42:40.003
But, boy, it's that first book that needs the attention, uh, I think.

42:40.023 --> 42:40.124
Yeah.

42:40.144 --> 42:40.785
Absolutely.

42:40.865 --> 42:42.667
Because why would anyone buy it?

42:42.687 --> 42:43.448
I mean, it's, it's,

42:43.580 --> 42:46.844
It's hard enough to sell first novels in hardcover.

42:46.864 --> 42:48.485
I remember I was at a seminar in Cambridge.

42:49.547 --> 42:51.028
I guess it's important that it's Cambridge.

42:51.068 --> 42:57.115
You know, it's a place where every book thing is up there.

42:57.135 --> 43:00.279
And somebody was saying, you know, publishing a first novel.

43:00.839 --> 43:02.862
Yeah, well, let me see.

43:02.882 --> 43:05.725
How many people bought a first novel in hardcover last year?

43:05.745 --> 43:07.166
Of course, the whole room put up.

43:07.247 --> 43:09.529
Oh, my God, I forgot it was in Cambridge.

43:10.110 --> 43:11.151
But you're absolutely right.

43:11.191 --> 43:12.152
People don't.

43:12.233 --> 43:13.557
They don't.

43:13.637 --> 43:15.542
They don't want to take that chance.

43:15.582 --> 43:24.386
Unless a great review appears, somebody they trust tells them about it, sometimes as gifts you'll receive a first novel, but it's true.

43:25.168 --> 43:26.171
It's very hard.

43:26.211 --> 43:28.437
For me, it's so exciting to discover.

43:29.142 --> 43:31.464
Well, that was a nice thing for me.

43:31.484 --> 43:35.408
I was up in Chester, Vermont, which the Boston Globe kind of was the first novel.

43:35.428 --> 43:37.551
Yeah, I thought it was the Jeffrey Stokes piece or something.

43:37.571 --> 43:43.977
Yeah, and there were 14 of us, all first novels, including Christopher Lamb and Hout, because that's his first novel.

43:44.117 --> 43:46.860
He did do a book, a baseball book, a couple of years ago.

43:46.880 --> 43:49.303
Right, and Joe DiMaggio.

43:49.323 --> 43:49.483
Yeah.

43:49.503 --> 43:56.550
So there were all these people who, this was their first book, and it was quite a range, and we all read, and we did

43:56.952 --> 44:00.897
There were 200 people at each of these readings in this little town.

44:01.057 --> 44:02.599
Isn't that great?

44:02.919 --> 44:03.059
Mm-hmm.

44:03.080 --> 44:04.822
Did you ask me about the title?

44:04.862 --> 44:05.723
You had mentioned that?

44:05.743 --> 44:07.185
No, no, I know the title.

44:07.345 --> 44:08.126
Right, right, right.

44:08.486 --> 44:19.440
Actually, at Ferris, I wasn't really so sure about this title, because it had the word God in it, I mean, capital G, God.

44:19.800 --> 44:23.905
Well, I'll tell you, just, you know, picking it up,

44:24.357 --> 44:24.798
What is it?

44:24.858 --> 44:27.602
If it is, you do have to ask yourself, what have we got here?

44:27.762 --> 44:28.383
Right.

44:28.423 --> 44:31.026
What does that mean?

44:31.046 --> 44:38.136
But I was very happy when I found this, and I was very happy to have that.

44:38.517 --> 44:40.439
I love Joseph Cornell anyway.

44:40.820 --> 44:41.281
It's very nice.

44:41.301 --> 44:43.424
I'm going to ask you to inscribe it for me.

44:43.444 --> 44:44.245
Oh, yeah.

44:44.505 --> 44:44.745
Sure.

44:44.846 --> 44:48.711
And your paper score is set.
