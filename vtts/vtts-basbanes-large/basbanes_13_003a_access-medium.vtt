WEBVTT

00:03.575 --> 00:14.527
But I'm not a prophet or a visionary, and I think that deserves a little discussion.

00:14.547 --> 00:16.369
These are possibilities for the future.

00:16.970 --> 00:30.004
Now, I won't... ...the key figures, which happen to be the neo-socialists and other negativist charmers, such as Jeremy Ritter, whose track records are, of course, no better than those of George Gilder and Faith Pothmark.

00:30.544 --> 00:32.907
But they happen to be wrong on the side of this author paper.

00:33.258 --> 00:34.039
such as life.

00:35.100 --> 00:40.626
I came away from that book thinking that I'm right to disclaim specific visions of the future.

00:40.646 --> 00:50.196
This speech will focus on aspects of the future I would prefer to see, which naturally means that I think those trends are probable, not inevitable, to be sure.

00:51.357 --> 00:55.421
My belief is that life tends toward more choices rather than fewer.

00:56.462 --> 01:02.809
I believe that technological change is neither smooth nor inevitable nor fully predictable.

01:03.363 --> 01:09.909
I also believe that people don't change as rapidly as a technology and that it's people who count.

01:09.929 --> 01:12.232
The technologists tell us how.

01:12.252 --> 01:13.833
It's people who have to decide why.

01:14.314 --> 01:22.041
I began using the slogan and not or as a general tendency of the future more than a decade ago.

01:22.642 --> 01:29.809
I now couple it with the claim that the best answer to most multiple choice questions is yes.

01:30.346 --> 01:35.135
Some of you may already assume that I'm a Luddite who just doesn't understand technology or the web.

01:35.456 --> 01:37.840
Others of you will probably conclude that during the speech.

01:38.341 --> 01:39.984
You are, of course, free to do so.

01:40.345 --> 01:45.094
I do note that the Luddites were right, although in losing cause.

01:45.114 --> 01:53.350
I would also note that I make my living as an information architect at the research libraries group, and that's a job title that really didn't exist prior to the web.

01:53.583 --> 02:02.496
My primary goals are as service manager for Eureka, which is a web-based and user search service, and as lead designer and analyst for its user interface.

02:02.516 --> 02:06.502
My entire adult life has been spent using computers to improve the library services.

02:07.143 --> 02:13.733
And although we still have a non-web version of Eureka, we're doing our best to get rid of it, which turns out to be surprisingly difficult.

02:13.753 --> 02:21.565
We're down to about 15% talent usage, and driving that down to the 0% we want has proven to be remarkably difficult.

02:22.658 --> 02:26.422
I think it's worth noting our own experience with predictability and change.

02:26.442 --> 02:33.909
Toward the end of the 1980s, a new standard emerged that seemed destined to establish the future of end-user searching interfaces.

02:33.929 --> 02:36.872
Z39.50 was adopted in 1988.

02:37.333 --> 02:44.420
The standard made it feasible for computers to query other computers in a standardized way, retrieving data in flexible standardized form.

02:45.341 --> 02:51.687
By the mid-1990s, the general assumption was that most bibliographic access would rely on Z39.50.

02:52.038 --> 02:57.608
Each campus would build its own ideal user interface as part of its own C3950 client.

02:58.249 --> 03:08.287
Using that client for its online catalog and for all bibliographic searches, it was incumbent on non-profit and commercial search systems to build robust C3950 servers.

03:08.888 --> 03:11.233
Otherwise, we'd be out of business.

03:11.313 --> 03:13.056
Okay, we were there early on.

03:13.076 --> 03:16.442
The organization at RLG has always been the leader for Stanford Stanford.

03:16.895 --> 03:24.004
Zephyr, our own Z3950 stamp from server, was probably the earliest robust production quality server in the United States.

03:24.645 --> 03:31.895
We know from server logs that most Z3950 clients, including most online catalog vendors, use Zephyr as a reliable test bed.

03:32.716 --> 03:38.664
The expected dominance of Z3950 had odd effects on RLG's development of search systems.

03:38.764 --> 03:41.788
We developed Eureka in 1992, and it was, of course, a talent-based service.

03:42.764 --> 03:47.872
It would have been hard to do a web-based search system in 1992 and have that much impact.

03:48.373 --> 03:52.039
It was developed as an internal C3950 client talking to Zephyr.

03:52.580 --> 03:58.850
The assumption was that most users would eventually migrate to their own C3950 clients and Eureka would just fade away.

03:59.872 --> 04:06.602
Well, as the web emerged and the Eureka team realized the use of a web version, it was difficult to get any attention internally.

04:06.622 --> 04:08.265
Wasn't everyone using Zephyr?

04:08.954 --> 04:13.461
We managed to get it built anyway by sneaking bits of resources here and there.

04:14.462 --> 04:19.349
The last few years have seen a significant change, and it's a change that came about for complex reasons.

04:19.850 --> 04:28.983
First, web access has made users and librarians comfortable with having widely varied interfaces within the overall browser environment.

04:29.003 --> 04:33.429
If the browser becomes a universal interface, what happens within it can vary.

04:34.151 --> 04:38.657
Second, very few academic libraries still do much in-house user interface development.

04:39.498 --> 04:44.624
Most colleges and universities now use commercial online catalogs and do limited customization.

04:45.525 --> 04:52.834
Those two trends combine to override the earlier trend that libraries wanted one uniform interface for all resources.

04:52.854 --> 04:57.760
Now they want the best interface for any given resource, and they generally don't want to build it themselves.

04:58.440 --> 05:02.025
They generally don't have the resources to build it themselves anymore.

05:02.045 --> 05:07.311
As a result, we can demonstrate that most end-user searching now takes place through web-based Eureka.

05:07.578 --> 05:15.668
which is also a Z3950 server client, not Z3950 to other clients, which makes it important to keep improving Eureka on the web.

05:17.090 --> 05:17.691
Well, here's the thing.

05:17.731 --> 05:27.223
Based on the common knowledge of a decade ago, Eureka would be starting to disappear, along with the web-made version of First Search and other national web interfaces.

05:27.243 --> 05:32.229
Local Z3950 clients would have taken over, but times have changed.

05:32.249 --> 05:35.593
Well-designed external web versions are back and forth.

05:36.468 --> 05:40.252
The moral to this story has a little to do with the web.

05:40.272 --> 05:45.858
It mostly has to do with the fact that times change in unpredictable ways.

05:45.878 --> 05:49.022
Academic libraries need to track change and deal with it.

05:49.802 --> 05:56.189
Dealing with it does not mean making long-range plans and sticking blindly to them, no matter what happens.

05:56.209 --> 06:01.395
It means accepting complexity, appreciating change, and maintaining creative flexibility.

06:02.776 --> 06:07.764
Well, now that I ask you to talk about the future impact of the World Wide Web on libraries and archives.

06:07.784 --> 06:10.348
I'll address that by offering three different broad scenarios.

06:11.069 --> 06:12.291
First, the web as light.

06:13.132 --> 06:15.816
Second, the web as CB radio.

06:15.836 --> 06:18.380
And third, the web as one piece of a complex whole.

06:19.161 --> 06:29.577
You could also call it the dystopian or being digital scenario, the pseudo-Luddite scenario, and the future that I consider both most probable and most worth pursuing.

06:30.333 --> 06:38.322
The third future, of course, is the one that calls for us to appreciate what we have now and build on it, rather than casting it away in favor of some wondrous new beginning.

06:39.424 --> 06:44.189
Now, of course, it's important to note that the answer to most multiple choice questions is yes.

06:44.730 --> 06:51.638
All three of these scenarios will be part of it, particularly because each person builds his or her own reality.

06:52.559 --> 06:56.904
Some people are already intent on living life for keyboards and displays.

06:56.924 --> 07:00.188
People wanting their wearable computers, wearing their little

07:00.607 --> 07:05.693
Things here, getting computer implants in their arms to be recognized as they go through doorways.

07:06.654 --> 07:13.201
Some people really only wish to cope with physical life through a set of wireless devices to keep them always connected.

07:13.221 --> 07:17.846
I spent an hour yesterday pleasantly at the Boston Commons in the Boston Garden.

07:18.207 --> 07:25.374
I can pretty well predict that these people were not there, slowing down, actually enjoying the lake and enjoying the presence of other people.

07:26.396 --> 07:27.677
I feel sorry for these people.

07:28.012 --> 07:31.759
I'm sure they feel nothing but disdain for folks like me.

07:31.779 --> 07:38.812
There are also many people who ignore the web entirely, just as many people neither have nor particularly want phone computers.

07:38.832 --> 07:41.257
I do not feel sorry for these people.

07:41.277 --> 07:44.603
Many of them are living life to its fullest and getting by just fine.

07:45.410 --> 07:52.317
I don't think that the answer to this problem comes through internet appliances, set-top boxes, or other devices.

07:53.038 --> 07:56.802
Some people aren't wired because they neither need to be nor want to be.

07:57.162 --> 07:57.983
There's nothing wrong with that.

07:59.425 --> 08:08.594
Most of us, of course, work with a complex combination of digital and analog tools, virtual and physical media, web connections, and life beyond the computer.

08:08.614 --> 08:14.320
That mix keeps changing, and the changes are by no means always toward more extensive use of computers.

08:15.717 --> 08:24.851
In a recent column in the Industry Standard, Hal Varian discussed a study done at UC Berkeley's replacement for a library school.

08:24.871 --> 08:28.877
Look, they didn't ask for accreditation so I can actually call it a replacement for a library school.

08:29.638 --> 08:39.193
That study suggests that most people won't pay much for full-time high-speed digital access in their homes because most people don't see much need for such access.

08:39.595 --> 08:51.613
Now, if Varian is right, and there was another article in the Industry Standard last week that seconds this notion through some other forecasting, then a lot of business models are going to be crumbling over the next decade.

08:52.053 --> 08:56.099
And based on my own home life, I tend to think Varian is on to something.

08:56.119 --> 09:00.726
I mean, my wife and I can certainly afford 30 bucks more a month for ADSL or cable internet access.

09:01.246 --> 09:04.070
And we can probably get either or both anytime we want.

09:04.370 --> 09:08.737
We have AT&T cable, we're served by Paxbell, we can probably get either one.

09:09.177 --> 09:10.759
We have two computers at home.

09:10.779 --> 09:16.347
If I didn't have a home computer, I would never have written 15 books, 200 articles, or 80 speeches on my own time.

09:17.649 --> 09:21.374
We don't see why we thought there was high speed full time access.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.296
Are we typical?

09:22.977 --> 09:23.778
Nobody's typical.

09:24.539 --> 09:26.622
I don't know that we're obviously behind the curve either.

09:27.283 --> 09:29.165
But let's go on to the three scenarios.

09:29.185 --> 09:31.168
I'm already running late and I just got started.

09:31.655 --> 09:35.841
Okay, first, the dystopian future for the web.

09:36.022 --> 09:40.489
Least likely the universal future is the all-digital, all-the-time future.

09:40.509 --> 09:51.666
We hide in our houses and apartments, telecommuting, ordering our groceries from Webman and everything else from Cosmo for home delivery, getting all our entertainment and information over the one big wire.

09:52.287 --> 09:58.236
Television, magazines, radio, books, movies, ballet, opera sports, and presumably painting a sculpture,

09:58.638 --> 10:01.663
All media are swept away by the great prevailing web.

10:02.544 --> 10:07.391
Call it convergence, call it inevitability, whatever you call it, I find it horrendous.

10:07.652 --> 10:10.997
I also find it highly improbable.

10:11.017 --> 10:14.602
Now, in fact, there's very little in Tim's speech that I disagree with.

10:15.284 --> 10:16.626
On the other hand, I did read his book.

10:17.807 --> 10:21.473
I'm hit upon the semantic web notion they also referred to in his speech.

10:23.663 --> 10:31.153
Friend, I don't want all the data in the world to look like one huge database with artificial intelligences calling that database.

10:31.253 --> 10:35.779
Partly, of course, you know, I worked in libraries in the late 60s and early 70s.

10:35.799 --> 10:42.148
I worked at UC Berkeley, and I remember the FBI coming to visit and saying, we'd like to know who took out such and such.

10:43.069 --> 10:48.616
And we managed to stall them long enough to get rid of all of our past circulation stuff and make sure we never saved anything like that.

10:49.578 --> 10:51.420
Now, you know, you say privacy isn't right.

10:51.460 --> 10:52.742
Of course, I come from California.

10:53.431 --> 11:00.861
And the only thing is privacy is in the California Constitution, one of the areas in which California is a little ahead of most of the country.

11:01.662 --> 11:06.108
Of course, we also have Scott McNeely in California saying that we don't have any privacy anyway.

11:07.390 --> 11:14.259
I think there are good reasons not to want everything on the web... Well, okay, I'll stop with that.

11:14.520 --> 11:16.963
I think there are good reasons not to want everything on the web.

11:17.984 --> 11:22.290
I also think there are good reasons not to want everything on the web to be...

11:23.755 --> 11:29.382
mutually accessible from database perspectives.

11:31.024 --> 11:37.671
I see virtues in being able to cross over various lines, but I see strong virtues in being able to keep some things separate.

11:38.973 --> 11:41.095
And I don't want to go into a lot more about that.

11:42.477 --> 11:47.603
I will say, I've had one experience lately, you know, the idea is if you do anything you should put it on the web because it's accessible.

11:48.022 --> 11:53.369
Well, I will tell you that in the future I will not be putting rough drafts of potential articles on my own website.

11:54.570 --> 12:09.348
Now that I have the experience of putting a 9,000-word rough version of a 2,000-word potential article on my website and having the article rejected in part because the 9,000-word draft had been on the website and said, oh well, people have already read it.

12:09.789 --> 12:15.075
Well, based on what I can figure out, this means that about 150 people have read it instead of 60,000 people.

12:15.477 --> 12:40.776
this is the way it goes but i'll now be you know much more cautious about what goes on my website and when there are other cases where of course i put things up there because i don't want to you know i don't expect them to be used anywhere else or because it's the right thing i put guiding america's local libraries on my website partly because there is no way that i would want that to be published in print form and partly because it was the obvious thing to do

12:41.043 --> 12:48.729
The reason I think that Google returns my home site is because conferences where I've spoken have tended to link to that home site.

12:49.110 --> 12:52.943
And Google's technology, which I find refreshing,

12:53.227 --> 12:55.591
also refresh you because they tell you how it works.

12:55.771 --> 12:58.916
I would that other search engines would tell you how they rank things.

12:58.936 --> 12:59.898
Google actually does.

13:00.439 --> 13:12.619
You know, while there can't be more than half a dozen sites that point to my website, those all have to be respectable sites that are pointed to by other people, and therefore, you know, you can't even find my website on most search engines.

13:12.939 --> 13:16.585
It comes up, number one, Google, which is, hey, this is good.

13:17.611 --> 13:23.441
But you may be able to figure out now I'm not actually entirely opposed to web.

13:24.042 --> 13:28.870
I rely on a lot as a part of life.

13:28.890 --> 13:32.556
Although very rarely at home, which is sort of interesting.

13:32.576 --> 13:35.761
The all digital future I don't think is even worth discussing very long.

13:35.841 --> 13:40.088
It has little room for public libraries or for libraries and archives in the future.

13:40.108 --> 13:42.532
I don't think it has much room for meaning or contemplation.

13:42.953 --> 13:44.175
That may be my own problem.

13:45.117 --> 13:56.557
In the all-digital future, anything that hasn't been digitized is abandoned as useless, and I find that some proponents of an all-digital future are all too willing to dismiss anything more than five years old as being worthless in any case.

13:57.800 --> 14:08.138
I've been accused of raising straw men, and I like to think that's true if I keep hearing these simplistic all-digital futures projected, not today.

14:08.540 --> 14:13.929
Just last month, I read the following in a library paragraph, which I will quote word for word.

14:13.949 --> 14:23.565
Librarian selectors in some of our subject fields have already said that they would like to receive only e-books and do not feel the need for any printed books.

14:23.585 --> 14:34.463
In other words, some librarians at one major university library are suggesting anything worth collecting in a modern university library must be digital because there are no reasons to prefer printed books for any resources.

14:35.185 --> 14:40.696
I find it horrifying, all the more so because the librarian who was writing about it didn't see anything wrong with this all digital stance.

14:41.597 --> 14:45.886
The Chronicle of Higher Education, last week I think.

14:46.407 --> 14:53.160
An article about trying to shut down a library as they rebuild one building.

14:53.427 --> 15:02.717
And it's an argument between two faculty who share the library, one of which is a management faculty and the other of which is agricultural economics.

15:02.737 --> 15:10.945
And the agricultural economics people want to keep a physical library because the people go back through the books from the beginning of agricultural economics.

15:11.466 --> 15:13.728
And here's one of the management professors' response.

15:14.129 --> 15:19.114
Professors and students in agricultural economics soon may never have been to hold a printed book again.

15:19.094 --> 15:23.298
They're going to have access sooner or later to all the books that have ever been written.

15:23.318 --> 15:24.639
This is the library of the future.

15:25.960 --> 15:34.328
Now, of course, also he's saying that because this is the library of the future, we can shut down, because eventually they'll have access to all this stuff, we can shut down the physical library now.

15:36.250 --> 15:37.651
I find that pretty horrifying, too.

15:38.172 --> 15:43.457
So, you know, the reason I keep talking about these strong men is because they keep popping up in print and at conferences.

15:45.259 --> 15:46.840
But I do think they're an aberration.

15:47.461 --> 15:52.385
I mean, I think there's abundant evidence that traditional media will not disappear, and they should not.

15:53.366 --> 16:03.955
Digital resources will complement physical resources, replacing them where web-based resources do the job better, and there are a lot of areas where web-based resources do the job better.

16:03.975 --> 16:06.057
Physical resources will continue to be critical.

16:06.678 --> 16:16.506
Apprented books will continue to be a core medium for libraries, just as physical archives will continue to offer the raw material for remembering and rethinking who we were and who we are.

16:17.684 --> 16:21.790
If we look at old and new media, we can generally see that addition is the rule not replaceable.

16:24.173 --> 16:44.383
You know, email is still the heaviest use of the internet and has actually become an intriguing new medium, one that I don't think libraries are doing much about or can do much about, except when you move beyond email to listservs, which predate the internet, Usenet, which is

16:44.566 --> 16:47.717
I've never been sure what the status of using it is.

16:47.798 --> 16:51.109
And the many different bulletin board systems, you have a complex picture.

16:51.210 --> 16:52.253
Are these media?

16:52.294 --> 16:53.317
Yes, I believe they are.

16:53.919 --> 16:55.365
Are they worthy of library attention?

16:55.485 --> 16:56.348
I'm not sure.

16:56.986 --> 17:10.798
I would note in preparing an article on the first 10 years of PaxL, one of the earliest major library listers, I was helped enormously by the fact that it's always been archived.

17:10.818 --> 17:19.206
And even more, of course, by the fact that that archive is now web accessible instead of sending off searches through telnet and having them come through email and having them come back.

17:19.486 --> 17:24.350
So the way that these things work together can be enormously useful.

17:24.370 --> 17:26.352
And it's just a piece of the real complexity.

17:29.369 --> 17:33.414
If all you want is data, digital is probably the way to go.

17:34.054 --> 17:40.021
Assuming you can cope with authentication and reliability and either solve or ignore the preservation problem.

17:40.041 --> 17:45.447
Authentication and reliability are things that can be dealt with, aren't doing very well, but it can be.

17:45.487 --> 17:49.372
Data really isn't very useful for most of us most of the time.

17:50.313 --> 17:54.798
You know, we may get data and information, but what we want and need are stories.

17:55.559 --> 17:59.123
Narratives that convey meaning, helping us to build knowledge and understanding.

18:01.904 --> 18:07.371
And I'm not sure that stories translate as well in general to the digital world.

18:08.292 --> 18:11.415
Some of them do, some of them don't.

18:11.435 --> 18:15.500
I will add one more note before I get off to the all-digital future and get into it.

18:16.181 --> 18:23.490
The World Wide Web has been around for less than a decade, less than one-third as long as the Mark Hornets.

18:23.909 --> 18:34.281
If this conference had been held in 1992, people might have been speaking about the future of Gopher and the future impact of Gopher space on libraries and archives.

18:34.301 --> 18:53.123
If it had been held in 1990, the topics might have been the future of open systems interconnection, how soon the internet would move from TCP IP to OSI compliant protocols, which sensible people believe should and would happen in 1990, and what OSI-based systems would mean for libraries and archives.

18:53.997 --> 18:59.883
At a matter of age, many so-called business journalists and observers would look at this conference and say, what's the point?

18:59.903 --> 19:02.305
The internet is about business.

19:02.325 --> 19:03.066
End of story.

19:03.086 --> 19:05.328
The web is about selling stuff.

19:05.348 --> 19:09.472
The whole point is to find more ways to sell things to people.

19:09.492 --> 19:11.114
Libraries and archives don't sell stuff.

19:11.354 --> 19:12.856
They're irrelevant and doomed anyway.

19:13.637 --> 19:18.081
Why use a library when Amazon is on the web?

19:18.101 --> 19:19.823
You don't think there are people who believe that.

19:20.363 --> 19:22.165
You haven't been reading the right publications.

19:22.685 --> 19:30.518
Is there some reason to believe that HTTP is the end of Internet innovation, that the web is the basis for all future scenarios?

19:31.419 --> 19:34.123
If so, I can't imagine what that reason might be.

19:35.105 --> 19:40.193
But there's a reason that it's got a very good group that's helping to define the future, but that isn't always enough.

19:41.135 --> 19:48.186
Truth to tell, TCPIP is an inefficient and aggravating set of protocols, which we all use nonetheless.

19:48.453 --> 20:05.177
And the stateless nature of the web is a source of continuing grief for system developers and users alike, and as the manager of a fee-based service that relies on session states, I can tell you that that's an ongoing problem.

20:05.197 --> 20:17.295
The most grandiose projections of all digital futures, with data walls responding to our presence, rooms all consist of these data walls, and you walk in and you say, hello, Mr. Crawford, what you need to know today is

20:17.900 --> 20:21.386
I think they all assume something far beyond today's worldwide web.

20:21.406 --> 20:31.902
I think it's likely that if such futures made any sense, the tools at their basis would have as little in common with the web as the web does with Telnet or Lister technology.

20:31.923 --> 20:33.545
Okay, enough of that future.

20:34.386 --> 20:38.473
There are elements of that future that I think will be part of the future for some people, for all of us.

20:39.128 --> 20:44.055
The second scenario, of course, I'm including for completeness and because there's a little bit of truth.

20:44.355 --> 20:48.381
A few years ago, some skeptics suggested that the web was like CB radio.

20:48.701 --> 20:54.168
It was a fad that would, in time, move from general use to be the home for a set of fairly specialized uses.

20:54.188 --> 20:57.733
In that scenario, the web becomes less the head pin as time goes on.

20:58.134 --> 21:00.597
And in a few years, we wonder what all the fuss was about.

21:00.813 --> 21:09.045
Libraries and archives might use the web as another way of providing access to catalog, but you'd find less and less need to offer in-house web access or think about new uses.

21:09.806 --> 21:17.478
I think that future is at least as improbable as the all-digital future, but there are elements that seem worth noting.

21:17.498 --> 21:24.348
They particularly seem worth noting when librarians are considering the survival of physical media against the overpowering steamroller of the web.

21:25.109 --> 21:27.833
Ken Lane, writing the online journalism review,

21:28.066 --> 21:39.482
which I will note is actually an online medium that has no print equivalent as far as I know, recently noted that there haven't been any bright new examples of web-based magazines in the last year or so.

21:39.502 --> 21:49.156
Go beyond Slate, Salon, Nerd, if you're up to Nerd, Edge Feed, what's left of it, all of which have been around for several years, and what do you find?

21:49.596 --> 21:50.638
Surprisingly little.

21:50.698 --> 21:53.061
Meanwhile, Nerd has started a print magazine.

21:53.733 --> 22:18.711
salon feet are trying to become bizarre forms of literary portals and slate has become a well-edited magazine of political views for people with very short attention spans it's on my bookmark list i'm not sure why but it is meanwhile new print magazines continue to appear more now than in the past there were more print magazines introduced in 1999 than there were in 1990 and some of them flourish

22:19.332 --> 22:27.705
Now, some are dying, including some of the bizarre group of print magazines about the internet.

22:27.865 --> 22:33.114
The explosions of magazines about the web, I mean, I hope it'll decline, partly because they just don't make a lot of sense.

22:34.015 --> 22:39.183
And partly because we have an awful lot of magazines about plumbing these days.

22:40.465 --> 22:40.866
You know?

22:41.767 --> 22:44.091
I mean, fundamentally, the web at its best

22:44.662 --> 22:46.664
is the internet is as fast as plumbing.

22:47.445 --> 22:48.986
It's a means to an end.

22:49.006 --> 22:50.307
It's a means to many ends.

22:50.988 --> 22:53.130
And what are interesting are the things you can do with it.

22:54.671 --> 22:59.135
URLs are fundamentally not designed to be particularly instant.

22:59.155 --> 23:00.256
They're designed to get a job.

23:03.319 --> 23:08.864
For most of us, actually, I think, particularly in the library field, the web has gone from fascination to tools.

23:09.745 --> 23:13.268
Not necessarily more interesting than light bulbs or wall-to-wall carpeting.

23:13.484 --> 23:17.971
We use it, but it's less important in some ways than it used to be.

23:17.991 --> 23:20.635
I know that my own set of bookmarks is shrinking, not growing.

23:21.416 --> 23:27.044
Partly, in fact, because there are search engines that I feel can substitute bookmarks.

23:27.245 --> 23:30.109
One in particular that I've already mentioned.

23:30.832 --> 23:35.136
And if I cared to take the time, I'd shrink my bookmarked list in half from its current size.

23:35.497 --> 23:42.744
And it used to take me two long coffee breaks and another quarter to a half hour at home each day to check out the sites I thought deserved daily business.

23:42.764 --> 23:49.371
That's now down to about 15 minutes total per day, except for sites that are particularly part of my work, which are a personal number.

23:50.352 --> 23:55.037
The overpowering concentration on the web as business comes with a sobering side effect.

23:55.858 --> 23:59.742
For most of us, most in time, business isn't all that interesting.

24:00.177 --> 24:08.006
We may have gotten a little too involved during the internet stock mania, but that mania may be subsiding, and some of us are getting back to life itself.

24:08.046 --> 24:12.311
If the web is just about business, which I don't believe it is, then it's fundamentally boring.

24:13.192 --> 24:17.436
And if there's one constant with regard to height, it's that height doesn't last.

24:17.997 --> 24:24.384
As the web moves beyond height, it's likely to lose some of its luster, and maybe gain some, you know, gain more validity.

24:24.965 --> 24:27.207
Well, not validity, it already has validity.

24:27.247 --> 24:29.610
I don't believe the web will dwindle into insignificance.

24:30.063 --> 24:37.477
I will think that most of us will find that we really don't need or want to spend hours on the web every day on our own.

24:38.419 --> 24:41.505
I believe we'll see retrenchment, particularly in the web business.

24:41.705 --> 24:42.587
That's happening already.

24:43.148 --> 24:44.912
Boo.com is pretty much gone.

24:44.972 --> 24:47.276
DrCoop.com is going.

24:47.296 --> 24:51.885
Probably at least half of the business website will be gone within another two or three years.

24:52.405 --> 24:55.010
I hope that Google isn't one of the losers.

24:55.451 --> 25:01.401
That's one of the rare cases where I would really like to see banner ads on the site because I don't see where they're getting their money from.

25:02.664 --> 25:04.767
But that's enough about the web becoming passe.

25:04.888 --> 25:07.893
Don't think it's going to happen.

25:07.913 --> 25:16.168
Quickly into the future I regard as most probable and most desirable is growing out of the press and becoming more complex rather than less.

25:16.385 --> 25:33.212
The web will serve libraries and archives in a multiplicity of ways, not as a replacement for buildings, physical circulated collections, and carefully conserved archives, but as a set of tools to improve current services, provide new services, create new kinds of publications.

25:33.817 --> 25:35.680
that maybe could only work on the web.

25:35.740 --> 25:36.722
And this is happening now.

25:36.762 --> 25:42.272
New England Digital Library is, I think, a fine example of the things RLG is working on now.

25:42.312 --> 25:51.047
Examples of things that actually could only be bought together through this set of tools, and gain accesses to resources beyond local pleasure.

25:51.588 --> 25:53.672
I've been talking and writing about these futures for years.

25:53.892 --> 25:58.761
Every library conference, every library of theoreticals includes discussions of ways the web is being used

25:59.112 --> 26:06.001
will be used as a service of libraries and archives, so I'm not going to go through a laundry list of current and future examples.

26:06.021 --> 26:08.464
I could spend all day, and I don't think you want me to.

26:09.825 --> 26:10.506
A few examples.

26:10.687 --> 26:18.016
Most good libraries and archives now use the web as an entree for the library, a way to inform the world what you're about, where you are, your hours, and so on.

26:18.036 --> 26:26.166
Many institutions now offer their catalogs on the web, frequently with access to circulation information if you're a user, bullets and renewals for web

26:26.315 --> 26:27.277
registered patrons.

26:27.297 --> 26:30.502
Some good online catalogs are now entirely web-based.

26:30.522 --> 26:35.209
Unfortunately, so are some not so good online catalogs.

26:35.229 --> 26:44.204
Many institutions band together to go beyond their own catalogs, offering regional and other unique catalogs, either within the libraries or on the general web or both.

26:44.224 --> 26:53.098
Some archives are mounting detailed findings to aids on your own websites, either using SGML via EAD or through less standardized web methods.

26:53.500 --> 27:00.377
We offer a service that now combines something like 14,000 of these, as was the last run, which is astonishing.

27:00.478 --> 27:07.375
I mean, being able to put together 14,000 detailed finding aids in a searchable manner is just astonishing.

27:07.658 --> 27:16.426
Notably, to do that, we had to back off from our pure standards-based reliance on EAD, because about a third of those are not EAD encoded.

27:16.526 --> 27:20.189
They're HTML sites that we just bring in as websites.

27:20.209 --> 27:30.959
And of course, we don't present SGML directly over the web, because it turns out the tools we're using are neither reliable nor readily available.

27:31.059 --> 27:37.665
So in fact, when you call up an SGML finding aid, you're actually getting HTML because we pay for and improve

27:37.645 --> 27:41.190
a converter that happens on our side.

27:41.210 --> 27:48.380
So yeah, in fact, when feasible, I'm tending to agree that email has enormous virtues as a way to present data, as in, it works.

27:49.221 --> 27:54.969
And boy, going beyond the game is difficult.

27:55.850 --> 27:59.115
Many museums and archives are promoting locally digitized surrogates.

28:00.016 --> 28:06.285
Our cultural materials alliance aims to develop new ways to combine digital surrogates in order to improve access to existing resources

28:06.586 --> 28:08.629
and to support new forms of scholarship.

28:08.649 --> 28:10.851
This is part that excites me.

28:10.891 --> 28:18.621
This is the part of the future of the web and libraries that I find really exciting, is putting old things together in new ways.

28:18.641 --> 28:22.345
But boy, this has taken a lot.

28:22.365 --> 28:32.678
And the key thing here is that you use the web to develop new resources rather than spending all your energy saying, gee, if you put all the books on the web then, well, of course, one, you can.

28:33.046 --> 28:40.217
post-1918 materials, you want to put them on the web, you better find out whether you legally can do so.

28:40.838 --> 28:41.780
And then why?

28:43.443 --> 28:47.709
Okay, a few minutes remain.

28:48.551 --> 28:52.958
Realizer, I want to talk about realizers very briefly.

28:52.978 --> 28:54.480
But then Tim already made my point.

28:56.317 --> 29:00.061
Real libraries combine resources, services, and places.

29:00.081 --> 29:06.449
Places are important, all the more so as some of yesterday's most fiscal predictions are turning out false.

29:06.909 --> 29:14.798
This was a set of projections that had us all fleeing from one another, cocooning, hiding in our houses and doing everything virtually.

29:14.838 --> 29:18.763
Meanwhile, our cities and towns would shrivel as we turned away from civic involvement.

29:19.148 --> 29:30.461
It required universal telecommuting, and it seemed to be inevitable by now, as a future that didn't hold much hope for public libraries as places, particularly public libraries in central cities.

29:30.481 --> 29:33.865
As you may have gathered, I have a particular love for public libraries.

29:33.885 --> 29:38.510
Fortunately, the future of universal flight was this most simplistic future.

29:38.530 --> 29:40.853
Problems of white flight have not finally gone away.

29:41.173 --> 29:43.055
Suburban enemy hasn't disappeared.

29:43.536 --> 29:45.558
Not at all cities are now urban wonderlands.

29:46.039 --> 29:47.080
Nothing is ever that simple.

29:47.330 --> 29:55.296
But I will claim that people are returning to cities in many cases, and that people are turning suburbs into cities, which is really interesting to watch.

29:55.837 --> 29:57.643
Real communities are coming back.

29:58.501 --> 30:04.331
The town where I work and now live had a dying Main Street that emptied out at 5 o'clock.

30:04.351 --> 30:14.668
That Main Street has been transformed to the heart of the thriving city center with performing arts, restaurants that do dinner business as well as lunch business, and oh yes, a new public library.

30:14.688 --> 30:17.893
I see it in Oakland where a hard-hit city is coming back to life.

30:18.214 --> 30:20.037
There are signs all over the country.

30:20.303 --> 30:25.149
In many cities and towns, public libraries have been the most resilient of the public spaces.

30:25.529 --> 30:33.659
Even if people abandoned the park, moved parks, moved their shop into the malls, and headed for restaurants in the suburbs, public libraries survived.

30:33.679 --> 30:39.706
With the resurgence of community experience, we've seen the resurgence of new and expanded public libraries.

30:39.726 --> 30:40.727
Libraries work.

30:41.508 --> 30:42.889
People gather at libraries.

30:43.570 --> 30:45.653
Towns and cities are actually building on a success.

30:45.713 --> 30:49.517
Building city centers now around the library will work.

30:50.341 --> 31:00.070
Libraries need to provide the cultural record and provide a range of information, enlightenment, and entertainment to those who wouldn't have ready access to it otherwise.

31:00.090 --> 31:07.476
Libraries typically deal more in digested data, information that someone has organized with some thought, than in late-breaking news and broad data.

31:07.496 --> 31:11.220
It's always been their primary role that should continue to be.

31:11.240 --> 31:13.822
Not the most glamorous role, it's important and realistic.

31:14.543 --> 31:17.365
And libraries have many roles that require play.

31:17.385 --> 31:19.487
But again, this is, I would make an argument here.

31:21.121 --> 31:23.505
I'd love to talk about preservation.

31:23.625 --> 31:24.827
It's an interest of mine.

31:24.907 --> 31:26.049
It's a real concern.

31:26.350 --> 31:30.016
On the other hand, we've got a whole afternoon full of experts.

31:30.036 --> 31:31.218
People like to know something.

31:32.239 --> 31:35.785
And three of the four speakers are from RLG member institutions.

31:36.286 --> 31:40.092
So the better perspective in this case is for me to leave it to them.

31:41.118 --> 31:46.548
I had a wonderful extended anecdote, but that would push the speech way over time, so I may skip it.

31:46.568 --> 31:48.351
Some of you may have already heard it, actually.

31:48.812 --> 31:59.150
It's about one suggestion for solving the issue of long-term access by scattering CD-ROMs across the landscape.

31:59.170 --> 32:02.957
And I go through the number of reasons why that wouldn't work.

32:03.950 --> 32:07.015
But I'm not going to go through it today.

32:07.035 --> 32:12.785
It will be the version of this talk that shows up on the website eventually.

32:12.805 --> 32:18.033
Because, of course, once I've given the speech, we're going to have no objection at all for being on our website somewhere.

32:18.394 --> 32:24.103
In this case, it would be on Nelenet's website, as opposed to being on my website.

32:24.684 --> 32:26.788
But it's an interesting anecdote.

32:26.848 --> 32:28.250
We'll go through it.

32:28.370 --> 32:30.514
And now I come to the conclusion.

32:31.405 --> 32:35.610
Anyone who's ever heard me speak must know that I have problems with conclusions.

32:35.630 --> 32:40.617
You could think of me as Stephen King of speaking, but without his gifts for plot-language storytelling money.

32:42.038 --> 32:44.361
And this speech is no exception.

32:44.381 --> 32:50.409
I don't have a good way of pulling all this together into a neat little package or, as a no-name magazine's colleague, a takeaway.

32:51.290 --> 32:55.095
I think that am not or is a good basis for thinking about the future.

32:55.736 --> 32:58.459
Adding new forms of information needed to present ones.

32:58.810 --> 33:02.274
only replacing present ones where that makes sense.

33:02.294 --> 33:09.784
I believe libraries and archives are making effective use of the web already to extend their services and to gain access to new resources.

33:09.804 --> 33:17.914
I believe that we will develop new and more innovative ways to use the web in the service of libraries, archives, their collections, and their users.

33:17.934 --> 33:20.216
I don't expect to see an all-digital future.

33:20.236 --> 33:22.700
I don't expect to see the internet become cast saved.

33:23.100 --> 33:25.543
And I don't expect the web to become next year's Gopher.

33:26.198 --> 33:29.844
Given my current and future job expectations, I would hardly wish to see that happen.

33:30.685 --> 33:41.923
I do expect and hope for a future in which we make effective use of physical and digital resources, provide the record of our culture to tell new stories and find better ways to tell old stories.

33:41.943 --> 33:50.096
And I look forward to hearing this afternoon's presentations on ways that we can preserve the new stories that can only be told through digital access.

33:50.116 --> 33:50.316
Thank you.

34:02.800 --> 34:04.423
Now we have some time.

34:04.443 --> 34:09.671
If Tim would like to join us on stage, we can ask Tim and Walt questions.

34:09.691 --> 34:12.075
There are microphones.

34:12.095 --> 34:17.784
Diane Baden is wandering through the center of the hall, including Mike.

34:17.804 --> 34:21.389
There's one to your left, and there's one to your right.

34:21.409 --> 34:23.673
Or did I do that backwards?

34:24.134 --> 34:24.855
But they're there.

34:26.297 --> 34:27.559
Do we have any questions?

34:31.117 --> 34:39.753
Well, let's see.

34:40.214 --> 34:45.784
Yes, this one's on.

34:46.456 --> 35:03.100
I don't think there is such a public perception.

35:03.120 --> 35:09.409
There is a perception among certain people among the public, among some students,

35:09.727 --> 35:20.804
Among some leaders, Paul Conway showed me two things from yesterday's New York Times, which I thought were fascinating, and I would say they're both wrong, but then that's fairly typical.

35:21.506 --> 35:23.969
The answer to multiple choice questions could also be no.

35:25.572 --> 35:37.050
One of them was saying, this is the future, the rocket e-book is the way everything should be, and one of them can't be bothered with computers at all, and is sort of, eh.

35:38.701 --> 35:42.107
Well, you know, the fact is adult book sales were up 3% last year.

35:43.509 --> 35:47.917
The largest retailer on the internet, it primarily sells physical books.

35:48.959 --> 35:52.685
So, you know, magazine circulation has never been higher.

35:53.967 --> 35:56.331
So I'm not sure that that perception actually exists.

35:56.772 --> 36:00.979
And I guess, I mean, university provosts

36:02.326 --> 36:05.310
You know, future libraries is still usable as a weapon.

36:06.352 --> 36:08.375
Being analog is still usable as a weapon.

36:08.435 --> 36:14.443
And yes, I am aware of a professor over in Cambridge when I used that title.

36:15.084 --> 36:17.507
And you do your best.

36:17.608 --> 36:23.836
It's going to be an ongoing battle because they really think they can save loads of money by believing that everything is digital.

36:24.157 --> 36:26.460
And belief is a really tough thing to fight.

36:26.710 --> 36:40.591
Can I ask an impression, a comment that Paul made, that this is really worrying that the way you say everything which is important should be on the web.

36:40.631 --> 36:48.162
That is the corporate culture that we have in the consortium which is based on the fact that people are all around the world and many of the people in fact who come to work in it.

36:48.142 --> 36:57.757
The MIT office have since, for family reasons, decided that other management family need to be other places in the world, and have moved to different states, to different countries, and we've kept them on the team.

36:57.777 --> 37:07.753
So, practically for us, within the discourse of our daily work, it is very impolite to discuss something unless you can give a point to it, because you exclude all the people who aren't physically in the room.

37:07.733 --> 37:09.154
who can't physically get to the coffee.

37:09.475 --> 37:16.162
I think this does not apply to all the archives that you have on physical objects or things in the museum, which are really important.

37:16.182 --> 37:21.628
It doesn't imply that if you can't get them onto the web instantly, they're not valuable, of course.

37:22.228 --> 37:24.571
So it's an interesting way of running a team to say this.

37:24.671 --> 37:28.975
In other words, I think this doesn't apply to everything else.

37:28.995 --> 37:33.160
I'd just like to put my weight behind physical things, too.

37:33.180 --> 37:34.061
Question from Bob.

37:34.882 --> 37:36.323
This is to Tim.

37:36.843 --> 37:43.251
We've seen recently that the internet is very vulnerable to all these viruses, the love bug viruses.

37:43.271 --> 37:49.238
And it seems that there are certain software that the love bug seems to love a lot.

37:50.760 --> 37:56.366
But my concern is that it points out the very fragile nature of the internet.

37:56.506 --> 38:03.475
And the World Wide Web is still linked to it because when your email is down or your internet is down, everything is down.

38:03.835 --> 38:05.517
Is there any way we can

38:06.121 --> 38:14.646
protect the whole system or are we at the mercy of Microsoft internet browsers or other browsers?

38:15.098 --> 38:20.086
I'd rather been a neutral consortium, so I don't make statements about particular companies.

38:20.106 --> 38:25.134
But I would say what you point out is not anything to do with fragility specifically of email.

38:25.955 --> 38:31.544
What you're looking at is the fragility of a system which is not fractal, which does not have structure at every level.

38:31.664 --> 38:34.328
The fractal system has many different sorts of software.

38:34.348 --> 38:38.495
It has a mixture, a good balance between homogeneity and diversity.

38:38.595 --> 38:43.182
We really need, in our society and in our software, diversity to survive.

38:43.162 --> 38:49.448
And what happens when you have a gene pool, or you have a very large population with a very small gene pool, is that a virus wipes it out.

38:49.468 --> 38:56.314
And guess what happens when you have a very large amount of software, which all comes out from the same, is cut from a copy of the same CD-roll, and a virus wipes it out.

38:56.734 --> 39:05.362
And you can make audio about how a particular manufacturer writes software, and you can, you know, put it up, basically, the effect would have been quite easily avoided with a little bit of thought.

39:06.062 --> 39:09.846
But the more fundamental point, I think, is about the structure, is about diversity.

39:09.966 --> 39:12.628
So I think you've made a point for diversity.

39:12.608 --> 39:17.492
It didn't affect anybody around the team at all.

39:17.532 --> 39:23.858
In fact, hardly anybody but you was taken out by it, although I understand that the United Nations went down its lanes.

39:28.683 --> 39:30.044
Yes, email went out.

39:30.704 --> 39:33.847
But it didn't take out from the web access.

39:33.867 --> 39:35.289
Generally, the internet was still there.

39:35.309 --> 39:37.150
It was people's mail.

39:37.551 --> 39:40.253
So the email was still there.

39:41.498 --> 39:42.421
Yeah, diversity.

39:43.063 --> 39:45.391
We need diversity in all things.

39:45.491 --> 39:53.719
And I think that whether it's analog or digital, if it's completely uniform, then it's a weakness.

39:53.969 --> 39:59.418
Some of you don't count that enough.

39:59.998 --> 40:09.433
Well, part of it, what happens is that because the software is connected, that it's a whole human company to get down on the system.

40:09.453 --> 40:16.544
So we're denied access at all to the internet.

40:17.626 --> 40:19.889
Now you're a serious problem.

40:20.130 --> 40:20.230
Sure.

40:20.800 --> 40:27.240
agreeing with everything he said actually, and of course I'm free to make nasty comments, which in this case I won't.

40:29.928 --> 40:34.843
That is a problem, I hate to say it, but needs to be solved in your own corporate culture.

40:35.245 --> 40:51.708
Now, we didn't shut down because, as it happens, we used two email systems, neither of which has ever heard of Microsoft Outlook, partly because one of them is 22 years old, and the other one is from a company I have very little respect for but happened to turn out good resuming software.

40:52.269 --> 41:03.345
The other part of this, the attacks on the internet itself, denial of service attacks, there was a wonderful, lengthy article in the Industry Standard about two weeks ago

41:04.321 --> 41:13.858
that shed some light on the reality of the extent to which denial of services standards were really threatening the internet, which is the threat has been enormously overblown.

41:14.459 --> 41:22.072
Unfortunately, partly because there are commercial concerns that want to make the internet safer for business by making it less useful for everybody else.

41:22.853 --> 41:29.164
And it was interesting that it was a business magazine that did a remarkable job of pointing out the extent to which this was true.

41:29.144 --> 41:32.871
And the virus is, you know, yeah, it's lack of diversity.

41:33.051 --> 41:39.383
You know, if we all marry our cousins, eventually we're going to have a lot more problem with diseases.

41:39.563 --> 41:42.469
And I think we're seeing that, and diversity is the answer.

41:43.811 --> 41:45.955
We have a question from the floating mic.

41:46.559 --> 41:52.548
My name is Bishop Carter, I'm an editor of the Los Angeles Times, although I'm not here as a journalist.

41:52.568 --> 41:56.094
I have a question that follows on the diversity issue.

41:56.114 --> 42:03.285
I work in the Macintosh world, and so I know what the pressures are like to get those things out of there and get some PCs on everybody's desk.

42:03.886 --> 42:07.251
But the question I have, something that Tim said earlier about

42:07.788 --> 42:10.952
Library seating to discourage proprietary formats.

42:10.972 --> 42:20.686
It's one thing that I do within my world are a dozen different file types at all times that are constantly migrating and constantly upgrading.

42:21.166 --> 42:23.850
And after a couple years go by, they don't work on the new hardware.

42:23.990 --> 42:27.054
And so to me, that's a diversity issue.

42:27.094 --> 42:29.678
And I wonder how you address things like that.

42:32.273 --> 42:42.125
Well, that, I suppose, is my life, is dealing with the tensions between the needs of diversity and the advantages of homogeneity.

42:42.305 --> 42:59.665
The history of HTML was that, before the consortium was founded to be a place where people could meet to bring these together, every browser you'd ever heard of had a set of extra features, and it was sold on the basis of these extra features in which you would use an X version of HTML.

42:59.830 --> 43:15.360
And it was, in fact, the irony was that because HTML was the universe that was invented, anybody could use it, anybody could think about the next possible, anybody could write software for it, anybody could develop it in a particular direction.

43:15.380 --> 43:17.283
So it was a very broad basis of development.

43:17.404 --> 43:21.872
So it advanced very, very quickly, but also advanced towards its frequency very, very quickly.

43:21.852 --> 43:28.921
And in fact, it was a very short cycle of people producing new slope tag that is in, that diagonal tag is in.

43:28.941 --> 43:35.469
So coming back towards, for a few weeks, one browser would do slope and the other one would do diagonal.

43:35.489 --> 43:39.114
And then both engineering teams would be told to support slope and diagonal.

43:39.614 --> 43:43.980
And they'd find that this was a waste of time when it comes to consortium saying we want to do rotating text.

43:45.021 --> 43:47.184
This is a fictitious example for each other.

43:47.244 --> 43:50.408
And we just want to discuss whether the parameters should be degrees or radians.

43:50.675 --> 43:54.681
And that cycle would just be a few weeks.

43:55.282 --> 43:58.987
So that is my criticism of the big question.

43:59.007 --> 44:02.612
But yes, every time you have a very big standard, it holds the world back.

44:02.632 --> 44:05.637
It means that you can't use the latest techniques in your document.

44:06.338 --> 44:16.512
And having a very wide number of different, interesting, exciting new programs out there is what's bringing technology forward.

44:16.532 --> 44:20.378
And you can do more and more exciting multimedia displays for your virtual museum.

44:20.999 --> 44:25.144
But a lot of these things flow very quickly.

44:26.225 --> 44:40.803
The marquee tag, which allows you to put crashing lights around something, still exists in some browsers, but is no longer a selling point, either for websites or for browsers, and the bling tank is now sort of embarrassing for everybody to be involved in it.

44:40.823 --> 44:42.805
I think that it is worth

44:43.443 --> 44:51.119
pointing out that web pages are out for so much longer than people imagine, than people make them for.

44:51.139 --> 45:00.760
So it is so that if you go and look at a website design and the choice there is whether to use the latest

45:00.976 --> 45:07.415
Flash doing splash, you know, or explode.com's their latest offering in multi-media things.

45:08.137 --> 45:14.496
Autocon, you think something which looks incredibly boring by today's standards, but will be so visible at the end of the day of time.

45:15.320 --> 45:20.369
It's worth explaining people how, in fact, you could do quite a lot with HTML.

45:21.611 --> 45:24.957
There are a lot of things you can point out as well.

45:25.839 --> 45:34.715
But if they use HTML, they're doing a potential thing with the HTML page.

45:34.735 --> 45:39.724
One of the mantras is separating the content from the presentation.

45:39.704 --> 45:45.195
And that used to be something which the STML community was very, very keen about.

45:45.817 --> 45:56.278
Everybody can try and keep the basic confidence standard.

45:56.984 --> 46:00.413
And it just didn't sell until the conversions happened.

46:00.433 --> 46:04.723
This conversions to people who have been writing about the years have become boring.

46:04.743 --> 46:09.515
And suddenly, in fact, it's happening now that you can browse the web on your cell phone.

46:09.876 --> 46:12.763
Well, I had a communications that was in Japan, picked up one of these stock emotes.

46:12.964 --> 46:14.588
It'll web-browse the listing.

46:14.568 --> 46:21.177
and went to the WTO website and was pleased to find that she could actually browse our website.

46:21.277 --> 46:26.824
It's partly because we didn't use any JavaScript, which the people of Gadget would not use.

46:27.465 --> 46:34.534
But also, we have a web accessibility initiative, which looks into a Halloween website, which people can browse if they're

46:35.020 --> 46:52.120
visually impaired, or they can't use a keyboard, or they can't use a mouse, and you end up getting some rules of design that are very much involved separating the context from the way you're presenting it, because a lot of the people you're interested in are getting some sort of disability, and we design it according to the disability guidelines.

46:52.140 --> 46:59.188
And that, in fact, has helped us to be independent of a particular browser, and hence independent of the device, which you use of.

46:59.168 --> 47:13.189
If you use these to see that when your websites follow these rules also, you can browse all kinds of little gadgets that you take out of your pocket, or you find a little wall, or you find a 20 billion pixel data wall, perhaps in the future.

47:13.950 --> 47:21.602
So this rule of actually using a pretty good content in the presentation is a very good one.

47:21.622 --> 47:25.227
I encourage people to stick with and liquid standards, of course.

47:26.337 --> 47:27.059
Thank you.

47:27.561 --> 47:30.590
I think we have an opportunity to get back on schedule.

47:30.610 --> 47:38.473
I know you have many more questions, but thank our two questions.

47:49.287 --> 47:57.680
Lunch will be picked up in the hallway in case you forgot what you ordered in your envelope.

47:57.700 --> 47:59.888
Feel free to come back and eat at your table.
