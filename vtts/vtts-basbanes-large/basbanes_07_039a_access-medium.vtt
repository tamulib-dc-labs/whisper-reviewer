00:02.933 --> 00:06.997
We're talking with Mr. William South, and he was telling us about this portrait.

00:07.017 --> 00:09.420
It's a painting of John Barrymore as Hamlet.

00:09.440 --> 00:13.524
It was done by Decker, who was a great pal of Barrymore's.

00:14.304 --> 00:21.171
And at home, the first time I saw it was in Barrymore's home on Tower Road, which Katherine Hepburn was leasing.

00:21.191 --> 00:23.674
And my wife and I housed it for six weeks.

00:23.774 --> 00:26.076
Oh, this was Peggy.

00:26.657 --> 00:28.799
When did we house sit for Hepburn?

00:28.819 --> 00:29.019
What?

00:29.039 --> 00:31.742
When did we house sit for Hepburn?

00:32.077 --> 00:33.159
Eddie was four.

00:33.299 --> 00:35.182
Four, so that's 45 years ago.

00:36.003 --> 00:43.874
And I admired that painting, and then we became very good friends with Kate and Spence, and actually Spence's family, too.

00:44.575 --> 00:53.128
And the last time I saw him alive, I guess I stopped and looked at that painting, and he said to the rapper, why don't we give that painting to Bill?

00:53.148 --> 00:53.589
He likes it.

00:54.129 --> 00:55.331
And she said, well, let me think about that.

00:55.371 --> 01:00.058
And eventually, cut through a long story, we were having lunch with her in London,

01:00.629 --> 01:01.891
And she said, do you see what they're painting?

01:01.911 --> 01:02.551
And I said, yes.

01:02.571 --> 01:03.633
She said, well, go.

01:03.653 --> 01:05.415
I'll tell my housekeeper you're coming over and get it.

01:05.435 --> 01:07.597
So that's the ship up there.

01:07.617 --> 01:09.339
Got an association.

01:09.620 --> 01:11.963
Was a ship that Kate gave to Spencer.

01:12.904 --> 01:19.311
And after his death, she invited Kate to me over and said, if you'd like something out of this room of Spencer's, take your pick.

01:20.132 --> 01:21.794
And I said, well, I'd like that ship.

01:21.814 --> 01:23.737
And she said, well, I gave that to Spencer.

01:23.757 --> 01:25.078
So she said, I'm very fond of it.

01:25.098 --> 01:25.879
You may have it.

01:25.899 --> 01:27.201
That was Spencer Tracy's ship.

01:27.341 --> 01:27.962
Yeah, yeah.

01:28.402 --> 01:30.124
Set on his mantle.

01:30.144 --> 01:30.585
These are.

01:30.768 --> 01:36.015
But a lot of these, before we start the real thing, we're friends of the Wright brothers' family.

01:36.696 --> 01:40.380
And this is a part of the original airplane, the first airplane to fly.

01:41.301 --> 01:49.892
As he says, these parts were broken while the plane was on the ground, overturned by wind after the fourth flight of that day, December 17, 1903.

01:49.953 --> 01:56.841
And this is Wolverine.

01:56.881 --> 01:59.745
Wilbur carried that all over the world.

02:00.890 --> 02:03.353
Orville Reddell parted with it, even after Wilbur's death.

02:04.014 --> 02:07.778
And the family considered it one of the few things of Wilbur that they retained.

02:08.599 --> 02:13.305
And anyway, this incident was an interesting little item.

02:14.065 --> 02:19.832
The first edition, volume one, of the West Side News, publisher Orville Wright.

02:21.674 --> 02:23.456
I'm getting this.

02:24.097 --> 02:27.782
But here's the satchel and Wilbur at Kitty Hawk.

02:28.542 --> 02:29.023
There it is.

02:29.358 --> 02:31.420
And then there's a photographer.

02:31.440 --> 02:32.561
Now, where did you find the photo?

02:32.761 --> 02:33.802
I got that from the family.

02:35.424 --> 02:38.066
And another thing in here is Tyrone.

02:38.166 --> 02:39.247
Oh, this is the boy.

02:39.287 --> 02:42.670
Here's a cartoon that appeared, I think, in the New York Daily News or something.

02:42.791 --> 02:45.573
Coming back from Europe, being welcomed by Wilbur Hedges.

02:46.274 --> 02:48.596
As he says, the satchel card.

02:48.696 --> 02:51.559
The satchel, they said, went every place to all.

02:51.699 --> 02:53.521
Now, was that a personal thing or tools?

02:53.721 --> 02:55.282
Or what are you supposed to find in it?

02:55.362 --> 02:58.285
He carried his socks in there.

02:58.720 --> 03:09.250
So anyway, where I've been at Wright, Miller, who's now 93 or 94, and her husband, also about that age, are good friends of ours, and we were pleased they had.

03:09.270 --> 03:11.111
That's quite an extraordinary event, isn't it?

03:11.131 --> 03:12.312
They had some of the propellers.

03:13.574 --> 03:13.794
Uh-huh.

03:13.814 --> 03:22.502
You know, and they're living them, and then they eventually gave thatâ€” They gave it to the Air Museum, and they permitted them a $750,000 write-off for that propeller.

03:22.522 --> 03:28.247
These people lived modestly.

03:28.267 --> 03:28.407
Mm-hmm.

03:28.842 --> 03:33.727
And still gave all these wonderful historical things that were worth, you know.

03:33.747 --> 03:39.193
I think the family sold the Kitty Hawk to the Smithsonian for one dollar.

03:39.233 --> 03:43.497
They have a whole album of checks for one dollar.

03:44.719 --> 03:48.282
Where they sold things to the museum to give, basically given it.

03:48.463 --> 03:50.365
Do they live in Ohio?

03:50.445 --> 03:53.628
Yes, they still live in Dayton.

03:53.668 --> 03:56.571
We talked to them quite a lot.

03:56.838 --> 04:22.137
any okay because it was a major major i'm going to put this close to you over here because what i have to say is when i was doing some research in the newbury last uh last fall i was going through some things and you actually have been a couple of times on a tamalei but we've been on the the one that that

04:23.922 --> 04:26.005
University of Schroderbach, the Regenstein.

04:26.045 --> 04:27.227
That's exactly right.

04:27.247 --> 04:29.230
I was the underbidder on that.

04:30.371 --> 04:44.171
What happened was that I... I had made a deal with Lou Feldman to bid for me, and Lou and I had falling out just before the sale because we found somebody else.

04:44.892 --> 04:51.561
He found somebody else to bid on me, and I said, let me do that.

04:51.701 --> 04:52.883
He said, no.

04:53.200 --> 04:54.582
It's not.

04:54.682 --> 04:58.906
And I said, well, in that case, we bought company because I'm going to bid on my own.

04:59.127 --> 04:59.787
And he said, fine.

04:59.827 --> 05:05.574
So I bid on my own, did not think the thoughts of John Fleming about it, who I've used before, and I knew.

05:06.515 --> 05:11.380
John later said to me, I wish you'd have talked to me, Bill, because he said, I could have saved you a lot of trouble.

05:11.420 --> 05:14.644
He said, you couldn't buy that book for any amount of money.

05:14.664 --> 05:17.547
Mrs. Regenstein had said, buy it, John, just buy it.

05:18.809 --> 05:22.633
So I stopped at $120,000, which was far the most

05:22.867 --> 05:25.111
Well, you've got to fit on the board.

05:25.131 --> 05:26.513
They sold for $123,000.

05:27.394 --> 05:33.765
And then I thought, well, that's the end of my efforts to get Tamerlane, and then this other copy came on the market.

05:33.785 --> 05:38.933
And I actually had earmarked four core items that I would love to have had.

05:39.333 --> 05:42.378
One was Tamerlane, which I did not expect again.

05:42.959 --> 05:43.520
At that sale.

05:43.600 --> 05:44.642
At that sale.

05:44.662 --> 05:49.650
And then I felt if I didn't get Tamerlane, I would then secondly try to buy our wrap.

05:50.474 --> 05:52.236
That would be a very interesting item.

05:52.256 --> 05:52.757
Yeah, excuse me.

05:52.877 --> 05:54.339
I'd love to have it if I don't have it.

05:54.860 --> 06:01.268
And if I didn't get Al Rapp, I was going to bid on the tail in the original rappers.

06:01.368 --> 06:04.352
I have the raven in the rap, but I didn't have the tail.

06:04.372 --> 06:07.176
And if I didn't get that, I was going to bid on the 1831 poems.

06:08.678 --> 06:13.104
But if I got Panelline, I wasn't going to bid on anything because I didn't have any money left.

06:13.124 --> 06:14.866
So that's actually what happened.

06:14.886 --> 06:16.448
So you went to New York with a budget then?

06:17.339 --> 06:20.962
Yeah, which I promptly exceeded.

06:20.982 --> 06:22.124
No, we talked about it.

06:22.144 --> 06:33.935
Peggy's been very supportive in all this, and I said, we're going to spend a lot of money on one book, and I don't know whether it's going to be Al Arab or Paralene or the poems, and she said, fine.

06:35.917 --> 06:44.865
I don't think I would have gone any higher than I did on Paralene, because it was a major stretch for us, and

06:45.638 --> 06:51.023
Secondly, I had some other things I would have settled for.

06:51.043 --> 06:52.805
Is that all you got at that sale, by the way?

06:53.225 --> 06:55.407
Yes, that's all I've been on.

06:55.427 --> 06:59.311
One, it was the talk of the hall, really, because not many people knew who you were right there.

06:59.932 --> 07:09.260
And this elegant gentleman and his wife, you were with him, as I recollect, were there, and they fit on one item, and that was that.

07:10.402 --> 07:14.025
Well, a true story that you might find interesting enough to put in your book.

07:14.393 --> 07:23.664
On the previous family, there's a head of the Red Book Department of Courage was a man named Arthur Freeman.

07:24.825 --> 07:26.387
Arthur came over to that sale.

07:27.288 --> 07:28.269
What sale was it?

07:28.550 --> 07:30.212
This was the gardens.

07:30.432 --> 07:34.016
No, that was just a manuscript, a book and manuscript sale.

07:35.197 --> 07:37.380
This was the one that the guy found up in New Hampshire.

07:37.881 --> 07:38.081
No.

07:38.481 --> 07:39.703
The one prior to that.

07:39.723 --> 07:40.864
This was the one prior to that.

07:40.884 --> 07:43.287
This was part of a major collector's work.

07:44.195 --> 07:50.561
Anyway, at that sale... We're doing good.

07:50.761 --> 07:51.061
Go ahead.

07:51.762 --> 07:53.143
We're doing fine.

07:53.163 --> 07:57.527
Arthur Freeman came over representing Quaritches, and he and I knew each other very little bit.

07:57.547 --> 07:58.588
We know each other better now.

07:59.589 --> 08:08.738
And he was at a time when he told me Quaritches didn't have much money to acquire things, and they had put a very tight leash on him, and they said, don't spend too much money.

08:08.758 --> 08:09.999
And he said, okay.

08:10.019 --> 08:12.261
So he came to the sale, and after...

08:12.848 --> 08:13.629
Tamerlane sold.

08:13.669 --> 08:15.872
He wired his boss back in London.

08:16.793 --> 08:19.236
Highlight of the sale, Tamerlane.

08:19.256 --> 08:20.518
Sale price $123,000.

08:21.039 --> 08:23.061
Self underbidder.

08:23.942 --> 08:26.205
And they thought he was the underbidder.

08:26.486 --> 08:30.751
And so they called him up and said, we told you not to bid.

08:32.333 --> 08:34.215
That's a great story.

08:34.276 --> 08:38.661
Well, that's the taste of it.

08:38.781 --> 08:40.864
And the doctor said it's a good story for him.

08:41.198 --> 08:54.009
I guess I asked you about the Tamerlane, not only when it started our talk, because that's how I met you, but perhaps you could use that as a window into your thinking as a collector.

08:55.311 --> 08:57.633
Why were you so set on the Tamerlane?

08:57.653 --> 09:06.741
And maybe that will give me a little insight on your focus as a collector.

09:06.761 --> 09:10.564
It is obviously the high spot of American literature, in my opinion it is.

09:11.236 --> 09:12.938
It's called The Black Tulip, as you know.

09:13.598 --> 09:19.905
And I guess an ego thing gets into your equation when you start going after a book like that.

09:20.766 --> 09:23.669
And I had a decent Poe collection.

09:23.989 --> 09:24.870
Peggy bought me, I think.

09:24.890 --> 09:29.115
The first Poe item was Arthur Gordon Pym.

09:29.135 --> 09:29.895
Arthur Gordon Pym.

09:30.896 --> 09:32.118
Arthur Gordon Pym.

09:33.259 --> 09:35.141
Yeah, and that got me going on Poe.

09:35.161 --> 09:41.007
And then over the years, we bought Murders in the Room, more of a George sale, which was a very rare item.

09:41.847 --> 09:46.332
And then I eventually bought The Raven in wrappers.

09:47.814 --> 09:52.378
And I have acquired some manuscript material.

09:52.459 --> 10:04.972
I have a fair copy of his poem for Annie, Thank Heaven the Name of the Crisis of the Last, which Peggy kind of forced me to buy it, because she kept saying, buy it.

10:05.513 --> 10:06.354
And I said, well, I don't know.

10:06.374 --> 10:07.215
It's a lot of money.

10:07.755 --> 10:11.179
Anyway, so I had built up what I thought was a decent book collection.

10:11.902 --> 10:18.694
But I was minus the two or three really high phosphates from Al Raft and, of course, family.

10:20.396 --> 10:30.113
So having lost it the other time, and at that time, too, we said if we buy this book, we've got to sell one of the children because, you know, it was a lot of money.

10:31.021 --> 10:36.489
And this time we decided, you know, in my lifetime, I may never give another crack at it.

10:36.549 --> 10:40.474
I think there's only two, maybe three in private hands.

10:40.494 --> 10:43.218
I guess there's three in private hands.

10:43.619 --> 10:45.842
You know that Dick Manning's books are being sold this fall.

10:45.862 --> 10:46.523
Have you read that?

10:46.603 --> 10:47.785
No, I didn't know that, no.

10:47.805 --> 10:50.048
I'd be happy to tell you a little bit about that.

10:50.448 --> 10:56.497
That's a very interesting story, including his tablet.

10:56.677 --> 11:00.943
All of his books had a little problem, I guess.

11:01.565 --> 11:03.808
It's one of the Shakespeare's that he bought.

11:03.928 --> 11:05.510
I know, he bought those recently.

11:05.710 --> 11:08.774
In November of 89 at the garden sale.

11:08.794 --> 11:10.596
So there will be another... Another Tamerlane.

11:10.636 --> 11:12.058
Another Tamerlane.

11:12.859 --> 11:14.902
And Bart Auerbach, by the way, says to say hello to you.

11:14.962 --> 11:16.624
Oh, yeah, nice fan.

11:16.644 --> 11:16.924
Nice fan.

11:16.944 --> 11:19.387
He has very nice things about you.

11:19.407 --> 11:21.971
He thinks that your Tamerlane, by the way, is better than Maddie's.

11:22.171 --> 11:23.172
I think it probably is.

11:23.833 --> 11:25.615
From what I hear, I never saw his.

11:25.976 --> 11:29.480
The one we did not get at the University of Florida is the best copy I've ever seen.

11:29.760 --> 11:31.082
It was a superior copy.

11:31.687 --> 11:39.531
And it's very funny because right after the University of Chicago bought that, we went to the University of Chicago.

11:39.551 --> 11:41.798
Peggy and I both went to the University of Chicago.

11:42.217 --> 11:50.586
And right after they got a letter soliciting funds for their rare book department, just talking to their own fellow, they'd expect me to give money to outfib myself.

11:51.386 --> 11:52.207
That's great.

11:52.367 --> 11:53.168
That's great.

11:53.188 --> 11:55.811
Well, anyway, I didn't make a contribution.

11:56.251 --> 11:59.995
But we were very friendly with Bob Norsenthal, who was there, and Bob was there.

12:00.256 --> 12:00.776
Nice man.

12:00.896 --> 12:01.337
Nice man.

12:01.377 --> 12:03.799
Just before I got out there.

12:03.899 --> 12:04.900
Nice man.

12:05.021 --> 12:09.405
He was very helpful to me in an item we were very proud of.

12:09.807 --> 12:13.212
We have part of Emily Bronte and Anne Bronte's diary.

12:14.655 --> 12:19.402
And the way that came about was that Bill Cagle, do you know him of the Lilly Library?

12:19.422 --> 12:21.806
Lilly went to see him.

12:21.886 --> 12:27.395
Well, Bill Cagle called me one day and said, I know where Emily and part of Emily and Anne's diary is.

12:28.717 --> 12:32.503
We can't afford it or it doesn't fit in with our collection.

12:33.124 --> 12:34.146
And he said, I thought of you.

12:34.586 --> 12:36.810
And he said, I'll put you in touch with the lady who has it.

12:37.246 --> 12:40.570
He said, I don't think she'll sell it to you, but I'll tell you who has it.

12:40.590 --> 12:44.614
He told me a lady in Chicago named Frances Cooper had it.

12:44.634 --> 12:46.757
And Frances was a wonderful old lady.

12:46.797 --> 12:48.959
She was certainly in her 80s, don't you think, when we met her.

12:49.900 --> 12:54.045
And she'd made her money with the Wrigley account.

12:54.065 --> 12:59.070
I understand that this lady personally handled the Wrigley account for years and years.

12:59.090 --> 13:01.993
And she had a wonderful Virginia Woolf collector.

13:02.014 --> 13:05.177
And she didn't really much care about the Brantes, or said so.

13:06.085 --> 13:13.696
And she had this diary, and the first thing she said to me when I walked in the door, I went to see her the first time by myself, and Peggy went later times.

13:14.658 --> 13:16.420
She said, I'm not going to say The Brownie Diary.

13:16.440 --> 13:21.748
And I said, fine, but I'm really just thrilled to see it, but she felt a little happy to show it to you.

13:21.828 --> 13:28.598
So we kept up, this went on for at least three or four years, and I was thinking every time we went there, she'd say, well, I'm not going to stop there.

13:28.618 --> 13:29.439
I said, no, I know you're not.

13:29.499 --> 13:30.401
I'm not asking you to.

13:31.562 --> 13:34.026
And then once when we went there, we were her house guests.

13:34.967 --> 13:35.468
She had lost.

13:36.038 --> 13:37.700
We could not find it.

13:37.720 --> 13:41.966
And she gave us carte blanche.

13:42.247 --> 13:47.334
Well, she had nieces, and we were the house guests, and I'm proud to collect it.

13:47.634 --> 13:49.637
You know, the scene is set for a crime.

13:50.238 --> 13:53.242
And she let us go through the whole house.

13:53.262 --> 13:55.706
We could not find it for her.

13:55.726 --> 13:58.270
And then I heard that she passed on.

13:59.992 --> 14:05.640
And I contacted the nieces, and they said they had found it just before she died in the hospital.

14:05.840 --> 14:08.123
She remembered where she put it.

14:08.143 --> 14:12.089
And they knew that she wanted me to have it.

14:12.109 --> 14:15.094
And they had gave it to Bob Rosenthal to appraise.

14:16.295 --> 14:21.723
And Bob Rosenthal felt unsure of himself in making the appraisal.

14:21.783 --> 14:24.447
So he involved John Fleming in New York.

14:24.808 --> 14:28.914
And the two of them appraised the book and told me what it was appraised.

14:28.934 --> 14:30.837
That meant I bought it.

14:31.117 --> 14:34.362
So we had a nice... What happened to the rest of her...

14:34.493 --> 14:37.737
So the ginger wolf she gave to her university, didn't she?

14:37.897 --> 14:39.639
Was it Smith or something like that?

14:39.659 --> 14:40.720
I think it was Smith.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.482
She gave a lot to Northwestern.

14:42.522 --> 14:46.807
She gave to, in general, she gave away.

14:47.127 --> 14:48.629
Were these things that she had acquired?

14:48.849 --> 14:49.149
Yes.

14:49.910 --> 14:55.616
She said she had never hoped anything she had.

14:55.637 --> 14:58.319
She was either given away or kept.

14:59.080 --> 15:03.285
So at some point that she had acquired a diary and then kind of lost interest in it.

15:03.569 --> 15:04.670
You know, I don't think she really did.

15:04.730 --> 15:06.112
In my opinion, she really loved it.

15:06.272 --> 15:09.455
And it was a little game we were kind of playing.

15:10.016 --> 15:11.357
She knew that I wanted it.

15:11.377 --> 15:12.999
She wasn't about to sell it.

15:13.259 --> 15:14.440
She didn't need the money.

15:14.521 --> 15:18.565
And I think she was very pleased to have it.

15:18.585 --> 15:26.453
The Grantees, every four years, they wrote a couple of pages on their birthday.

15:27.414 --> 15:31.078
And this was one of the first things that it's coming.

15:31.548 --> 15:36.936
transcripts of the diary that started 30 years old.

15:36.976 --> 15:41.602
My collecting, if you want that background, started with our daughter.

15:42.143 --> 15:53.639
Our daughter is now a middle-aged lady with two teenage daughters, but once she graduated from high school, we asked her what she wanted for high school graduation.

15:53.739 --> 15:55.021
Is that accurate?

15:55.041 --> 15:56.143
It was junior high.

15:56.163 --> 15:56.743
Junior high, okay.

15:56.783 --> 15:57.364
She was quite young.

15:57.384 --> 15:58.205
You were living out here?

15:58.386 --> 15:59.327
Yes, we were around here.

15:59.932 --> 16:09.205
We've lived out here for forty-five years, forty-six years, forty-seven years.

16:09.325 --> 16:15.954
Anyway, she said that she'd seen a huge copy, she thought it was the first edition, as it turned out to be, of Huckleberry Pink.

16:17.236 --> 16:20.901
And it was in a huge bookstore, and it was $50.

16:21.582 --> 16:23.284
And that's what she wanted.

16:23.304 --> 16:28.251
So we bought it for her, and she was very pleased, and it was on that library shelf up there.

16:28.518 --> 16:30.520
That's an unusual thing for a... Yes.

16:30.660 --> 16:32.782
Well, she's now a professional librarian.

16:32.862 --> 16:37.346
She doesn't work at it because she's raising her children, but that's her master's degree in library science.

16:37.406 --> 16:40.789
So it's been ingrained for a long time.

16:40.809 --> 16:49.717
And then we all went to London, by all I mean my daughter and Peggy and I. And she wanted to go get something in Dickens.

16:49.738 --> 16:55.723
So we went to shops we'd heard about, Spencer's, specialized in Dickens.

16:56.277 --> 16:58.139
And I think she had a hundred dollars to spend.

16:58.199 --> 16:59.720
Well, she had a little more than that.

16:59.740 --> 17:02.623
She had her life saving, and I think it was around three hundred.

17:02.643 --> 17:03.444
Three hundred dollars.

17:03.484 --> 17:03.884
Yeah.

17:04.765 --> 17:06.207
She wanted, Dickens was her.

17:06.687 --> 17:07.067
Really?

17:07.087 --> 17:07.848
It was a big thing.

17:08.349 --> 17:09.930
What's this daughter's name?

17:10.210 --> 17:10.611
Barbara.

17:10.631 --> 17:10.791
Barbara.

17:10.811 --> 17:11.652
That's my daughter's name.

17:11.672 --> 17:13.053
Barbara Lloyd Malone.

17:13.874 --> 17:16.717
Yeah, so she, well, what happened, Bill had to come back.

17:17.678 --> 17:19.439
Barbara and I went to W.G.

17:19.459 --> 17:20.000
Spencer.

17:20.420 --> 17:23.263
And we went first to the Dickens house.

17:24.053 --> 17:28.260
and she asked them where she should go, and they told her it doesn't have the expenses.

17:28.280 --> 17:51.816
She also asked them, by this time she had just graduated from high school, she asked if she could have some of the red geraniums to take over to his grave, because we were going from the Dickens House to Westminster Abbey, and there were some elderly ladies kind of taking care of the Dickens House.

17:52.201 --> 17:53.403
They were told to wrote it.

17:53.423 --> 17:57.910
They said the scarlet geranium was his favorite flower, and that's why they were in the box.

17:58.851 --> 18:05.902
So we went from there and took the little bouquet from his house to his grave at Westminster Abbey.

18:06.002 --> 18:08.326
And then the next day we went and made out for him.

18:08.346 --> 18:10.189
She made it at W.P.

18:10.209 --> 18:10.649
Spencer.

18:11.992 --> 18:16.959
So when we got there, Nellie Clark was the lady's name.

18:17.320 --> 18:19.423
She said, how much do you have to spare?

18:20.686 --> 18:25.993
Barbara told her, and she said, well, you must have an autograph.

18:26.013 --> 18:32.381
And she said, she put out a few things, because when Barbara called, she told her what she was interested in.

18:32.401 --> 18:37.988
So she bought a straightforward edition of Tale of Two Setties, wasn't it?

18:38.088 --> 18:38.969
Pickwick.

18:38.989 --> 18:40.331
Pickwick.

18:40.351 --> 18:42.293
And a check.

18:42.313 --> 18:48.381
And the Pickwick had a photograph, kind of tipped in of Dickens, and his

18:49.087 --> 18:51.769
sisters or daughters, I always forget which.

18:52.110 --> 18:55.593
And with that, we then came home.

18:56.734 --> 19:06.102
The following year, Bill and I went to London, and he said, you know, I'd kind of like to go to that rare bookstore last year.

19:07.243 --> 19:12.388
So he called this clerk, and he said, my daughter and wife were in last year.

19:12.408 --> 19:17.473
Oh, she said, I remember she got a straightforward edition of Pickwick and the check.

19:17.493 --> 19:18.874
You know, she knew exactly.

19:19.242 --> 19:21.805
So, that was the beginning.

19:21.825 --> 19:25.130
Were you feeling the onset of the virus?

19:25.751 --> 19:26.612
Yeah, I did.

19:26.632 --> 19:29.456
And I've always been a collector, but not a book.

19:30.097 --> 19:32.520
I mean, I've got a magic collection.

19:32.540 --> 19:34.723
I've got part of the Hurston Show upstairs.

19:35.183 --> 19:36.866
I'm a collector of Antioch.

19:37.386 --> 19:38.588
I'm a Russell Bill collector.

19:38.608 --> 19:40.550
I am an early Hollywood collector.

19:40.631 --> 19:43.595
I've got more Valentino stuff than you've ever seen in your life.

19:44.255 --> 19:47.400
I've got thousands of pictures of Valentino.

19:47.480 --> 19:49.182
We live in a bubble.

19:49.685 --> 19:52.469
Well, I wanted to be a collector, but I did not know anything about it.

19:52.489 --> 19:54.872
Oh, we were meaning from childhood?

19:54.892 --> 19:57.616
Yeah, I think so, really.

19:57.917 --> 20:03.625
And then, I kid about this a little bit, but there's some truth to it.

20:03.645 --> 20:08.892
I started looking for books for Barbara, and some of them were fairly expensive.

20:09.453 --> 20:14.420
And after I bought them, I thought, well, we really can't give Barbara this expensive gift for no reason.

20:14.460 --> 20:17.064
We've got to be fair to our other sons.

20:17.625 --> 20:18.426
And so I started seeing

20:19.216 --> 20:20.757
And I said, I've done a terrific library.

20:20.797 --> 20:22.719
Barbara's still waiting for her next book.

20:22.739 --> 20:26.903
But really, Barbara did get me going, and then I got very interested.

20:26.923 --> 20:29.265
And I, too, got interested first in Dickens.

20:29.285 --> 20:31.207
Dickens was my first collector.

20:31.407 --> 20:38.093
And I think you indicated on the phone that he's probably your greatest single collector.

20:38.113 --> 20:38.493
Well, it is.

20:38.633 --> 20:43.898
That whole shelf over there, those three panels, they're all Dickens, first editions.

20:44.739 --> 20:49.223
I have 23 or 24 presentation chapters.

20:49.507 --> 20:51.089
Hans Christian Andersen and George Eliot.

20:51.169 --> 20:52.731
Is there one of those here that we can see?

20:52.852 --> 20:54.073
Yeah, they're both here.

20:54.093 --> 20:56.176
I brought one of the Hans Christian Andersen.

20:56.196 --> 20:59.280
What did you describe to Hans Christian Andersen?

20:59.380 --> 21:01.243
One to George Eliot.

21:01.403 --> 21:07.211
Those are, when we say association copies, those are association copies.

21:07.231 --> 21:19.007
I have one of the, it is known that Dickens autographed X number of bodies, I've forgotten exactly how many, of The Christmas Carol on, I think, the 17th of December.

21:19.527 --> 21:23.852
That's the earliest known date that he inscribed a copy, and I have one of those.

21:23.872 --> 21:25.153
So I have some nice associations.

21:25.293 --> 21:28.237
We have to tell you anything that you'd like.

21:28.257 --> 21:28.998
Yeah, we'll tell you.

21:29.018 --> 21:31.180
If you have any particular interest.

21:31.200 --> 21:37.066
I think at some point, I'd love to get just a little more of a background.

21:38.008 --> 21:47.458
Well, you know, Peggy is, in a modest way, collected Robert Louis-Stevenson, particularly child-striving verses.

21:48.113 --> 21:51.277
It gave us a mutual interest when we'd travel.

21:51.297 --> 21:52.659
You know, we'd look up bookstores.

21:53.020 --> 21:55.383
Instead of going to a saloon, we'd go to a bookstore.

21:55.423 --> 21:57.225
So it worked out very well.

21:57.305 --> 21:58.166
That's the first thing we do.

21:58.267 --> 22:07.299
We went out to the Huntington this morning, and Bill Moffat, we were there to see Bill, and they had a book sale going on over there.

22:07.319 --> 22:10.903
He said, you're not buying books.

22:10.923 --> 22:11.564
I'm sorry.

22:11.664 --> 22:13.827
We come to California area.

22:13.927 --> 22:15.369
I have a sense that you're a collector.

22:15.630 --> 22:15.910
I mean,

22:16.210 --> 22:22.297
Clearly, this has to be a synergistic kind of thing almost, don't you?

22:22.337 --> 22:27.183
Well, I'm not really a collector.

22:28.685 --> 22:37.375
Apparently, I'm an exception to the rule that they're not always sympathetic to the husband's collection.

22:37.395 --> 22:40.058
But I have enjoyed being on the fringe.

22:41.523 --> 22:45.487
I really don't have much interest in acquiring.

22:45.547 --> 22:48.670
I enjoy the project probably more than it.

22:48.690 --> 22:50.732
How do you mean I enjoy being on the fringe?

22:50.892 --> 22:55.497
If you could just elaborate on that.

22:55.517 --> 22:57.739
Being on the fringe of the collecting?

22:58.019 --> 23:02.263
The fringe, meaning that on the fringe of Bill's collecting.

23:02.824 --> 23:07.468
I'm exposed to it, I'm part of it, but I'm not the one now.

23:07.869 --> 23:11.192
It is true that Bill will hesitate to buy

23:11.577 --> 23:14.541
And I encouraged him to go ahead and do it.

23:15.001 --> 23:18.766
He had said, we often regret what we don't bought.

23:18.786 --> 23:20.748
You seldom regret what you bought.

23:20.768 --> 23:26.015
You say, gee whiz, I should have done this.

23:26.816 --> 23:34.586
But I don't have the interest in acquiring myself.

23:34.626 --> 23:40.673
If there is a sale, to give you an example, if there's a sale coming up, I think you won't even look at the catalog.

23:40.733 --> 23:41.314
No, I don't.

23:41.480 --> 23:46.967
I will look at the catalog, and I will say to her, hey, there's a Bronte letter, or there's a Poe item.

23:47.347 --> 23:48.188
I'd love to have it.

23:48.208 --> 23:48.989
She says, what is it?

23:49.029 --> 23:49.730
We talk about it.

23:50.311 --> 23:57.320
If we go to the sale and bid on it, she's there saying, keep going.

23:57.480 --> 24:01.825
Oh, they're frightening, aren't they?

24:01.865 --> 24:07.352
You see, when he bid on the first Tamra line, the one that went to the University of Chicago,

24:09.020 --> 24:15.928
I was so incensed, as was Bill, at this deal, for being so, you know, crooked.

24:16.088 --> 24:17.650
There's no other way to put it.

24:17.670 --> 24:19.271
Well, he was opportunistic.

24:19.371 --> 24:21.874
Opportunistic and unprofessional.

24:21.934 --> 24:32.566
Now, honestly, at that point in our lives, we would have had to put a mortgage on the house to buy that book, had Bill gotten it for $120,000.

24:32.666 --> 24:33.407
Would you have done that?

24:35.210 --> 24:36.332
Well, we had assets.

24:36.532 --> 24:41.359
We could have done it, but it wasn't a case of... I mean, but did it mean enough to you that you would consider that?

24:41.880 --> 24:43.302
Yeah, yeah.

24:43.402 --> 24:45.545
I wasn't prepared to do it.

24:45.565 --> 24:47.468
I did it.

24:47.488 --> 24:49.451
You know, the proof is that I did it.

24:50.232 --> 24:52.776
Yeah, and I was in full agreement.

24:54.118 --> 25:02.871
So tell me, Phil, why would you consider... You didn't, I understand you didn't, but what is so important about getting this item that you would even consider

25:04.252 --> 25:06.796
Well, I mean, certainly it's not because of the value of it.

25:07.276 --> 25:08.678
I know it's an investment.

25:08.698 --> 25:09.139
No, I don't.

25:09.479 --> 25:11.582
We don't buy for investment.

25:12.484 --> 25:13.225
It's rarity, I think.

25:13.245 --> 25:13.565
It's rarity.

25:13.585 --> 25:21.777
It was the... He thought it would be the last one he would ever have an opportunity to buy.

25:22.258 --> 25:27.786
I don't think that you can say you have a great Poe collection if you haven't got talent.

25:27.806 --> 25:29.027
You can say you've got a good Poe collection.

25:29.708 --> 25:32.993
I don't think you can say you've got a great Lewis Carroll collection if you haven't got a 65-hour.

25:33.243 --> 25:39.168
You see, it's not like going and buying a mint coat or something.

25:39.228 --> 25:47.215
It is something of intrinsic value that will hold it to value, probably increase in value.

25:47.335 --> 25:53.801
So whether you are putting your money in one place or another... Yeah, I'm going to clarify.

25:53.821 --> 25:56.303
In fact, undoubtedly increase in value.

25:56.323 --> 26:02.929
But to clarify a point that's obvious, I think, really, is we weren't going to have to deny our children going to college,

26:03.483 --> 26:07.669
we weren't going to have to, you know, take my mother's off of the lounge or something.

26:07.689 --> 26:09.251
You know, it wasn't that kind of thing.

26:09.351 --> 26:15.138
It was just that $120,000 cash would, you know, have to sell them.

26:15.158 --> 26:19.003
Well, how many of us have the bouncing or welder?

26:19.184 --> 26:28.115
You know, and it's obvious that you could afford to do it, but I'm looking for the, you know, the mindset.

26:28.516 --> 26:29.037
Now, we did.

26:29.117 --> 26:33.102
Connie and I interviewed a guy in Sacramento last year on our last trip.

26:33.436 --> 26:36.681
who in fact mortgaged his house to get a Hemingway item.

26:36.701 --> 26:41.608
And when we were there, his wife was in the process of divorcing.

26:42.329 --> 26:43.812
No, I don't think we've ever done that.

26:44.312 --> 26:57.112
I think that we have spent more on some books than we planned to, but never, I don't think, at the expense of security or comfort.

26:58.654 --> 27:00.557
I remember when we bought our 65 Alice,

27:02.073 --> 27:07.438
Peggy was, she didn't mind it, the book collected.

27:08.139 --> 27:09.780
Peggy wanted to give me, was it a birthday present?

27:10.141 --> 27:10.801
I think it was.

27:11.042 --> 27:13.124
She wanted to give me a birthday present.

27:13.144 --> 27:16.707
And what she now says she had in mind was maybe a $500 book.

27:16.927 --> 27:18.909
Or a thousand, you know, something like that.

27:19.229 --> 27:23.433
And we have had very good luck with a dealer in Chicago at that time, Hamlin Barker.

27:24.374 --> 27:27.938
The books are now dead, but there's someone who's taken over there.

27:27.958 --> 27:30.240
But Hamlin Barker were wonderful old ladies,

27:30.473 --> 27:32.356
always had something kind of special.

27:33.358 --> 27:45.959
And I called them, long distance, and I said to Miss Hamill, I'll tell you what you want to buy me, she knew both of us, and buy me this present, and what have you got?

27:45.979 --> 27:50.386
And she said, oh dear, which was one of her favorite expressions when she had something special.

27:50.827 --> 27:52.891
She said, oh dear, I've got something coming in.

27:53.492 --> 27:56.076
People don't know we're going to get it.

27:56.410 --> 27:58.652
It may be beyond what you plan to spend.

27:58.672 --> 27:59.433
I said, what is it?

27:59.453 --> 28:01.134
She said, Alice, 65 hours.

28:02.316 --> 28:06.800
And I said, well, forgive me, Francis, but, you know, I know the consensus.

28:07.360 --> 28:08.321
I know where they all are.

28:09.903 --> 28:11.845
There isn't one for sale that I know of.

28:11.865 --> 28:13.366
She said, well, yes, Bill, there is.

28:13.466 --> 28:18.371
She said, the Forsheimer Library, the son, once in a while, takes to buy a mountain and sell it.

28:18.571 --> 28:22.254
And he has, a few years ago, sold this to another lady.

28:22.274 --> 28:24.316
And she now wants to dispose of it.

28:24.336 --> 28:26.198
She asked us to do so.

28:26.971 --> 28:29.193
And she also has two, three others.

28:29.474 --> 28:33.338
And I said, well, what do you want for it?

28:33.378 --> 28:36.722
She said, $25,000.

28:36.742 --> 28:40.126
That's a steal, though.

28:40.206 --> 28:40.847
I know.

28:41.287 --> 28:44.451
I'm not even thinking $500 or $1,000.

28:44.531 --> 28:48.315
I have to hang up the phone and say, well, she catches me.

28:49.636 --> 28:50.738
But $25,000.

28:51.118 --> 28:53.281
Now, she had quoted me two, three other things.

28:53.301 --> 28:54.582
She had a...

28:54.713 --> 28:57.216
A Russian translation, that was $1,000.

28:57.236 --> 29:04.424
She had a beautiful copy, I bought it finally, but of the 66 Alice, the finest copy I've ever seen.

29:04.765 --> 29:05.646
That was another $2,000.

29:05.706 --> 29:10.131
The significance of the 65, that's the one he wanted to suppress, isn't it?

29:10.151 --> 29:10.652
Yes, yes.

29:10.672 --> 29:12.293
There are 19 copies, I think.

29:12.313 --> 29:15.057
There are, I think, two or three in private hand.

29:15.077 --> 29:17.159
Justin Schiller has one.

29:17.179 --> 29:22.365
Anyway, I said she's got a 65,000.

29:22.385 --> 29:23.927
I want to hear about it in this poem.

29:24.093 --> 29:25.274
20 years ago?

29:25.535 --> 29:25.875
I don't know.

29:25.895 --> 29:26.536
Approximately.

29:26.556 --> 29:27.277
It's in the 60s, 70s.

29:27.337 --> 29:28.519
But he thought he was trying to deal.

29:29.099 --> 29:32.203
So he did talk to me and couldn't call him a pack.

29:32.223 --> 29:36.528
And he said, you know, I think I'll offer $25,000 for all of them.

29:36.549 --> 29:41.294
They're waiting to get him through for me, $1,000 worth, along with the $65.

29:42.356 --> 29:43.317
So he called her back.

29:43.357 --> 29:44.278
She said, oh, dear.

29:44.498 --> 29:53.830
She said, you know, we have someone waiting now who will pay the $25,000.

29:54.822 --> 29:56.904
So he snapped it up.

29:58.245 --> 30:01.308
But we didn't snap it up in the sense of, sure, we'll do it.

30:01.888 --> 30:06.912
We really did some soul-searching about whether we... At that time, it was the most we ever spent for any book.

30:08.053 --> 30:11.396
And the reason we bought it was the same reason I guess we bought Camino.

30:12.277 --> 30:17.221
We felt we would never again get another chance, I thought, in my lifetime probably.

30:17.241 --> 30:20.844
But it turned out there was another one that came up, two of us, in one sale.

30:21.365 --> 30:22.826
It was Heritage, wasn't it?

30:23.466 --> 30:24.087
It closed you?

30:24.792 --> 30:52.352
I was just going to say, you know, the rule of thumb now is anything

30:54.813 --> 30:57.537
10 or 15 years ago, you can add a zero in the value.

30:57.938 --> 31:00.481
I was offered a $300,000.

31:00.501 --> 31:05.589
Yeah, Mark Heim called me and said, yes, we had a client.

31:05.609 --> 31:09.755
That's fine, and that's not likely to be the kind of detail.

31:09.835 --> 31:20.010
The funny part, my sister was visiting at the time that Mark Heim made the offer, and she lives in Mount Floyd, but much in Washington.

31:20.362 --> 31:27.853
So she was privy to the conversation with the law discussion, so she called her son and told him about this offer.

31:28.634 --> 31:34.862
And then she said, and he didn't take it.

31:34.902 --> 31:36.925
That's why.

31:36.985 --> 31:41.892
I'll just use it without mentioning the individual.

31:42.373 --> 31:43.635
Yes, that's my fault.

31:43.655 --> 31:44.796
You mentioned Luke Bowman.

31:45.778 --> 31:46.639
Did you know him well?

31:47.294 --> 31:49.876
Well, he bid for me two or three different sales.

31:49.997 --> 31:55.622
I did get mad at him, as I mentioned earlier, when he accepted a bid higher than mine.

31:55.642 --> 31:58.505
The thing that made it so bad, I won't bore you with all the details.

31:58.565 --> 31:59.926
No, this is enough movies.

31:59.946 --> 32:01.367
Kelvin's an individual I'm interested in.

32:01.387 --> 32:07.233
Well, the thing that upset us the most was we had dinner with Luke Kelvin the night before that sale with Tamerlane.

32:07.854 --> 32:10.256
And I had given Luke some other bids.

32:10.276 --> 32:12.178
And he said, what are you going to do about Tamerlane?

32:12.618 --> 32:13.899
And I said, I'm not going to bid on it.

32:13.919 --> 32:14.500
He said, why not?

32:15.273 --> 32:17.396
And I said, because it's going to go for too much money.

32:17.436 --> 32:18.257
He said, how do you know that?

32:18.998 --> 32:20.219
And I said, well, what do you think it'll go for?

32:20.239 --> 32:21.821
He said, I know exactly what it'll go for.

32:21.841 --> 32:23.243
He said, it'll go for $50,000.

32:23.363 --> 32:25.346
I said, why do you know that?

32:25.366 --> 32:28.990
He said, well, because the guy that bought it, Stockhausen, I guess it was.

32:29.070 --> 32:29.992
Stockhausen bought it.

32:30.793 --> 32:32.595
I think he paid $40,000 for it.

32:33.256 --> 32:35.719
He said, it was very recently.

32:36.139 --> 32:37.982
He said, the universities don't have the money to bid.

32:38.603 --> 32:43.289
I believe they've got a $45,000 reserve on it, and I think the first bid over that will get it.

32:43.309 --> 32:44.470
So you buy it for $50,000.

32:44.939 --> 32:46.541
without going into a lot of detail.

32:46.861 --> 32:50.666
We said, okay, if it goes for that, we'll give up.

32:50.686 --> 32:52.047
He said, fine.

32:52.067 --> 32:53.990
So I arrived at the sale the next morning.

32:55.051 --> 32:55.632
All excited.

32:56.453 --> 33:00.237
And Lou came to me and said, I've accepted another.

33:02.420 --> 33:05.263
Another party has come to me.

33:05.283 --> 33:05.904
Back on again.

33:06.324 --> 33:11.871
Lou, and Lou said, you know, I've dealt with this man before.

33:11.891 --> 33:13.933
He's a very regular fellow.

33:14.656 --> 33:16.159
He's an old customer.

33:16.579 --> 33:20.105
He's willing to bid more than we discussed, he said to me.

33:20.125 --> 33:21.788
I said, well, I might go more.

33:21.808 --> 33:25.554
You know, we agreed that if it went more than that, we'd talk it over before we dropped out.

33:25.574 --> 33:33.127
And he said, well, very honestly, I don't believe that you can meet what this man's going to bid.

33:33.147 --> 33:34.850
So I said, well, fine.

33:34.870 --> 33:38.035
At $90,000, I drove Feldman out of the bidding.

33:38.055 --> 33:39.718
And he was the slightest himself.

33:40.036 --> 33:44.941
I drove him out at $90,000, and I thought we were going to buy it.

33:45.682 --> 33:48.565
And John Fleming hadn't even bid at this point.

33:48.585 --> 33:53.009
And then when Feldman dropped out, and it was just me, I thought, I'm going to buy this book.

33:53.129 --> 33:57.254
Feldman, Fleming, woke up and said, you know, $95,000 or whatever.

33:57.374 --> 33:58.735
So he waited till... He waited.

33:59.616 --> 34:02.819
And then, as he told me later, he was told to buy it at any cost.

34:03.100 --> 34:05.002
So I wouldn't have dropped it.

34:05.582 --> 34:06.603
But that's what happened.

34:06.623 --> 34:07.444
But it was fun, right?

34:07.913 --> 34:08.394
Yeah.

34:08.414 --> 34:10.998
Do you get a little bit of a... Well, it made me famous.

34:11.238 --> 34:16.867
I went into a bookstore shortly thereafter because it was written up, you know.

34:16.887 --> 34:18.749
This sale was in Chicago, I think.

34:18.769 --> 34:20.011
No, it wasn't in New York.

34:20.071 --> 34:21.193
That's how it was in New York.

34:21.333 --> 34:21.514
Yeah.

34:22.275 --> 34:27.222
And I went into a bookstore I'd never been in before, and the manager or someone came up to me and said, may I help you?

34:27.262 --> 34:36.176
And I said, my name is Bill Self, and I was like, oh, Mr. Self, he said, we wouldn't have anything that would interest you.

34:36.416 --> 34:37.718
I thought it was quite amazing.

34:38.373 --> 34:44.163
Now, you mentioned the 65 Alice, to jump back.

34:44.925 --> 34:46.467
Is this a high spot acquisition?

34:47.369 --> 34:49.152
No, I have Lewis Carroll in depth.

34:51.396 --> 35:03.317
Most of my authors I have in some depth, certainly Dickens, Poe, Bronte, I think we have all in the Bronte novel, Austen, the first position we have all of them, Eliot,

35:03.753 --> 35:07.778
You know, and then certain authors, I would have to say, are absolutely high spots.

35:07.818 --> 35:15.048
I have one Melville, I have Uncle Tom's cabin, I have, you know, Origin of the Species.

35:18.412 --> 35:20.234
And I'm pretty much into literature.

35:20.254 --> 35:24.680
I don't have, people talk to me sometimes about books that are covered in 1471 or something.

35:24.760 --> 35:26.222
I don't know anything about it, you know.

35:26.342 --> 35:27.023
Incunables.

35:27.123 --> 35:28.045
Yeah, that kind of stuff.

35:28.065 --> 35:30.408
I just don't know anything about it.

35:30.428 --> 35:32.190
We had a look at the 5,000 books.

35:32.407 --> 35:34.910
are so in funerals at the Huntington's.

35:34.930 --> 35:35.471
That's quite a thing.

35:35.511 --> 35:36.452
That's quite a thing.

35:37.092 --> 35:42.899
And when we were down in the vault area today, they took us down to the depths of the place.

35:43.239 --> 35:47.404
I had one kind of amusing thing with the Huntington's.

35:47.745 --> 35:54.753
We have a copy of Watery Heights, which has Charlotte Bronte's notes in her sheet book.

35:54.773 --> 35:58.617
And those notes were disputed by someone who wrote a book on it.

35:59.086 --> 36:07.593
and said that they didn't think there were any evidence that those notes were made by Charlotte, even though Charlotte had edited the book for the second edition.

36:08.734 --> 36:18.823
The book came from Charlotte's husband, so it came out of the parsonage, through Charlotte's husband, to Clement Shorter, to so-and-so-and-so, to me.

36:19.544 --> 36:25.269
So here you have a book that came from Charlotte's library, and who else's notes would be in that?

36:25.909 --> 36:28.992
So I wanted to get some expert opinion on this from the Huntington

36:29.782 --> 36:33.505
And I called them and told them my story.

36:34.186 --> 36:35.006
And they said, fine.

36:35.107 --> 36:41.932
And they would get out their copy of Weathering Heights when I came over and we would have a chance to compare.

36:41.952 --> 36:49.959
Then he called me back, sort of very stupid, and said, we never got a copy of Weathering Heights.

36:49.979 --> 36:52.041
So I was very pleased with that.

36:52.121 --> 36:59.147
But it is a, we've had several experiences with potential forgeries.

37:00.325 --> 37:05.631
One of the more interesting one was at the sale in Chicago.

37:05.651 --> 37:06.292
What was that?

37:06.432 --> 37:07.333
It was a Joyce sale.

37:08.154 --> 37:12.319
I bought Murders in the Rumor there through Lou Felton.

37:12.339 --> 37:24.453
And prior to the sale, I had said to Lou that I wanted to bid on, if I didn't get Murders in the Rumor, I wanted to bid on a page of manuscript called The Rationale of Mercy.

37:24.473 --> 37:30.079
And it was estimated, I don't remember what it was estimated, but $5,000 or whatever it was.

37:30.903 --> 37:40.255
And so I bought Murders in the Revoir, and then I said to Lou, don't bid on the rationale, because I'd like to have it, but I've spent my money.

37:41.517 --> 37:52.492
So then the auctioneer on the rationale said, we have been advised that this might be a forgery, and the state has requested that we sell it anyway.

37:53.273 --> 37:59.661
They don't want to keep it, but we're advising you that you have to buy it, knowing that it might not be genuine.

38:01.177 --> 38:03.200
So Luke turned to me and said, what do you want to do?

38:03.220 --> 38:05.463
And I said, well, let's do it.

38:05.563 --> 38:08.468
So he did, I honestly think it was $150, wasn't it?

38:08.488 --> 38:13.014
And the auctioneer, glad to get rid of this thing, put the hammer down and said, sold.

38:14.096 --> 38:22.748
At which point, very famous New York dealer named Papantonio, Michael Papantonio.

38:22.768 --> 38:26.313
He stands up and says, Mr. auctioneer, I am trying to buy that.

38:26.554 --> 38:27.495
I'm bidding on that article.

38:27.515 --> 38:30.880
And he said, ask my neighbors that I have been trying to get your attention.

38:31.552 --> 38:34.234
At which point, he jumps up.

38:34.975 --> 38:42.402
And one good thing, if he was on your side, at this time he was, he was a very gruff, bluff, and formidable opponent.

38:42.942 --> 38:46.705
He jumps up and he said, the hammer has fallen, I bought it for Mr. Self.

38:46.725 --> 38:49.108
And we consider the item sold.

38:49.888 --> 38:52.070
So the auctioneer was standing there not knowing what to do.

38:52.090 --> 38:53.291
He could open the bidding again.

38:53.391 --> 38:53.732
He could.

38:54.392 --> 38:59.837
But Papitoneo put up and said, if it's for Mr. Self, I will withdraw my book.

39:00.003 --> 39:04.750
He's a class man.

39:04.770 --> 39:09.858
He gave his collection of bindings to the American Antiquariate Society, which is pre-eminent.

39:09.938 --> 39:15.968
Then afterwards, Todd Ponyer came up to me and said, you know, it's absolutely general.

39:16.068 --> 39:25.042
He said the companion pieces, there's a page in the bird collection, there's a page at the hunt, and so forth and so on.

39:25.082 --> 39:28.407
And we've since visited those places that have compared.

39:28.690 --> 39:31.153
It is absolutely fabulous.

39:32.634 --> 39:35.637
So we've had good luck in that.

39:35.858 --> 39:37.099
What, Kramer?

39:37.539 --> 39:43.646
Do you have any impression that you thought this was not a forgery when you told someone to come after this?

39:43.686 --> 39:45.007
We were not knowledgeable.

39:45.067 --> 39:46.189
I wasn't knowledgeable enough.

39:46.209 --> 39:47.450
I had looked at it beforehand.

39:47.490 --> 39:49.032
It certainly looked like Poe's handwriting.

39:49.052 --> 39:50.293
There's no question about that.

39:50.974 --> 39:54.497
And I only was buying it as a... Oh, it's an interesting curiosity.

39:54.658 --> 39:57.921
You know, I've got a piracy on...

39:58.610 --> 40:03.355
And I got it for $20 down in the building.

40:03.375 --> 40:10.883
Well, the wise forgeries, some of the wise forgeries are very valuable.

40:10.943 --> 40:13.887
But the piracies are collectibles in their own right.

40:15.929 --> 40:20.694
Tell me about glaring at things that you still covet.

40:20.774 --> 40:23.537
Maybe that's too strong a word.

40:26.167 --> 40:27.689
I don't cover it a lot.

40:28.210 --> 40:31.534
You cover it in Carolyn.

40:31.554 --> 40:31.634
Yes.

40:31.654 --> 40:33.196
There are some books I'd like to have.

40:33.537 --> 40:34.138
Okay.

40:34.158 --> 40:35.399
And let's strike the word cover.

40:35.439 --> 40:37.162
No, but there are some books I'd like to have.

40:37.242 --> 40:42.669
And recently I had a chance to acquire two of them, and now I didn't choose to do so.

40:42.689 --> 40:43.410
One was The Whale.

40:43.931 --> 40:45.893
I'd like a copy of The Whale.

40:45.913 --> 40:48.316
And I'd like to have... That's the British.

40:48.336 --> 40:49.137
That's the British.

40:49.158 --> 40:50.079
That's the British movie.

40:50.960 --> 40:55.566
And I was offered a copy for $25,000 a year or so ago.

40:56.609 --> 40:58.571
which by today's standards is cheap.

40:58.591 --> 40:58.992
Not bad.

40:59.513 --> 41:00.334
How was the condition?

41:00.774 --> 41:03.357
Beautiful condition.

41:03.377 --> 41:12.649
The circumstances, I won't give you the name of the dealer, but he brought me both The Whale and Frankenstein in the board, and I wanted both books.

41:13.190 --> 41:14.311
But he wanted to trade me.

41:14.331 --> 41:15.533
See, I have a lot of duplicates.

41:16.153 --> 41:19.498
I have duplicates of most of the major dickens items.

41:20.439 --> 41:25.485
And he wanted to trade me some of my duplicates for these, which is not a bad idea.

41:26.613 --> 41:36.922
He really, I felt that he knew more about books than I did, and I wasn't able to equate my books to his books, and I just felt uncomfortable about the deal.

41:37.302 --> 41:38.923
And he was straightforward.

41:39.284 --> 41:43.107
He said, I have to, I'm my pencil.

41:43.127 --> 41:49.553
So he wanted to buy from us wholesale.

41:51.134 --> 41:52.395
So we didn't get those two books.

41:52.455 --> 41:54.617
Both of us I would like to have.

41:54.637 --> 41:55.978
Do you regret not making the deal?

41:57.865 --> 41:59.507
I regret not paying him cash for it.

41:59.547 --> 42:01.929
Yeah, that's what I was thinking, too.

42:01.949 --> 42:03.311
I don't regret having kept the book.

42:03.331 --> 42:04.852
So you had an either-or situation.

42:04.872 --> 42:05.113
Yeah.

42:05.453 --> 42:06.634
He was trying to make it easy for me.

42:06.654 --> 42:07.795
He said, look, you've got these students.

42:07.815 --> 42:10.658
This one's just wearing a string.

42:10.678 --> 42:12.400
Maybe you just don't want to part with any of the books.

42:12.420 --> 42:12.781
No, I don't.

42:12.861 --> 42:14.723
I only saw one book in my life and I'm mad about that.

42:14.883 --> 42:19.007
I think that's what it's all about.

42:19.488 --> 42:26.335
There's a very important facet of your collecting that you have omitted.

42:26.355 --> 42:27.316
What's that?

42:27.336 --> 42:27.636
Ten years.

42:29.152 --> 42:32.736
I'm also going to admit, Kenyon, we can certainly talk about Kenyon.

42:32.776 --> 42:37.761
I mean, he added so to the funds of your book collection.

42:37.781 --> 42:48.012
The reason I have what I modestly feel is the greatest dick inflection in the world is not through my efforts or penance, but through the efforts of a man named Kenyon Starling.

42:48.292 --> 42:49.213
Do you know that name?

42:49.354 --> 42:49.554
No.

42:50.515 --> 42:57.302
Well, all the book dealers old enough to know it, and you'd have to be in the business 10 years.

42:57.738 --> 42:59.540
No, Kenyon Starling.

42:59.561 --> 43:06.290
Kenyon Starling was a gentleman from Dayton, Ohio, and I am from Dayton, Ohio.

43:07.251 --> 43:23.914
And at the Sudanese sale in London, which was a major Dickens sale, Peggy and I went to London with our modest budget of what we wanted to buy from the Sudanese sale.

43:24.957 --> 43:28.901
We did not get, I don't think, a single item that was my first choice.

43:28.921 --> 43:31.203
We bought a few items, nice items.

43:31.223 --> 43:34.487
But I kept getting outbid by someone.

43:35.047 --> 43:35.908
LDS.

43:35.928 --> 43:36.409
LDS.

43:36.449 --> 43:37.049
Lou Feldman.

43:37.890 --> 43:41.554
So I finally said to someone, who's Lou Feldman bidding for?

43:41.834 --> 43:44.116
And he said, he's bidding for a guy from Dayton, Ohio.

43:44.377 --> 43:45.818
I said, I'm from Dayton, Ohio.

43:46.959 --> 43:48.741
And he said, well, this guy's a recluse.

43:48.821 --> 43:52.345
And I thought he said his name was Sterling, so I remembered that name.

43:53.266 --> 43:54.627
And we came back.

43:56.564 --> 43:59.649
not having gotten a lot of the things we wanted.

43:59.669 --> 44:08.421
And we were going to go to Chicago on business for some kind of a television convention or something.

44:08.582 --> 44:20.519
And I said to Peggy, well, why don't we try to go over to Dayton and see some friends in Dayton, and I'll try to find this guy, Sterling, who wrote this and see if he'll show me his collection, though he's supposed to be a recluse.

44:21.701 --> 44:25.947
So I didn't know how to contact him, so I called Don Fleming from Los Angeles.

44:27.175 --> 44:29.598
And John, of course, was in New York.

44:29.618 --> 44:31.300
And I said, do you know this guy?

44:31.961 --> 44:33.884
I didn't want to call him the government.

44:35.105 --> 44:38.630
I thought he might not want me to get together with his clients.

44:38.650 --> 44:40.292
And that would be understandable.

44:40.312 --> 44:45.599
And so John was coming and said, the gentleman's name is Starling.

44:45.699 --> 44:48.302
And he was standing by my side.

44:49.283 --> 44:55.411
I said, I'm calling you 3,000 miles away about a guy that lives in Dayton, Ohio, and he's standing by your side.

44:55.491 --> 44:56.052
He said, yes.

44:56.926 --> 44:57.787
He said, do they put it on?

44:58.267 --> 44:59.248
So I said, this is about it.

44:59.268 --> 45:00.129
Isn't this okay?

45:00.349 --> 45:01.170
True.

45:01.190 --> 45:07.315
And I said, I'm from Dayton, Ohio, and I was at the Susan O'Sale, and I'd love to, we're coming to Dayton, and I'd love to see your collection.

45:07.335 --> 45:07.856
She said, by all means.

45:08.436 --> 45:09.097
So we make a date.

45:10.879 --> 45:24.090
Peggy and I went out, and it was a library, which would put my library to say, not only all the authors we've talked about, but this way, Thackeray, and Trollope, and all the modern... Conrad.

45:24.291 --> 45:26.933
Conrad, and the modern Hemingway, Faulkner,

45:27.318 --> 45:33.425
Well, our relationship really began about 1970.

45:33.445 --> 45:38.550
It's been 20 years, at least, that this happened.

45:38.711 --> 45:45.118
And as you do, after we were ready to leave, we said, well, Mr. Starling, if you ever get to Los Angeles, look us up.

45:45.138 --> 45:47.861
We'd love to show you my library.

45:47.881 --> 45:48.181
We'd say, fine.

45:48.221 --> 45:49.503
People never do, but we'd say fine.

45:50.163 --> 45:54.889
So the phone rings one day, about a year later, and it's Mr. Starling, and he's going to come out, and he'd like to see my library.

45:54.909 --> 45:56.110
So we took him to dinner.

45:56.528 --> 45:58.551
that I've talked with a lot.

45:58.571 --> 46:03.857
And we told him the story of Huckleberry, the first edition of Fifth Back.

46:03.877 --> 46:05.980
He said, well, you must see my copy of Huckleberry.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.643
Then because it's pristine, it was.

46:11.427 --> 46:13.349
Then we had a nice evening with him.

46:13.750 --> 46:18.015
Then, I think this is correct.

46:18.035 --> 46:20.278
I may have seen him one other time in the book.

46:20.378 --> 46:25.084
But just remember, he went home back in that visit, and then he wrote

46:25.756 --> 46:37.088
And he said, I want this because I would like her to have my copy of Huckleberry Finn.

46:37.348 --> 46:38.109
Oh, my God.

46:39.190 --> 46:48.701
So he was going to decree her his copy of Huckleberry Finn because she had kind of started the library and she had gotten this little kind of a poor copy, you know, and so forth.

46:48.941 --> 46:49.722
Then go ahead.

46:50.322 --> 46:51.303
Well, then I ran into her.

46:51.323 --> 46:52.685
I went into a bookstore in New York.

46:53.045 --> 46:54.767
It's another year, you know, down there.

46:55.591 --> 46:57.673
I had no real contact with him.

46:57.713 --> 47:01.856
Went into a bookstore in New York, and there he is, smoking a pipe, looking for books.

47:01.877 --> 47:04.359
And this is amazing.

47:04.379 --> 47:05.920
Well, it's an amazing story.

47:06.521 --> 47:08.743
And I said, Mr. Darling, what are you doing in New York?

47:08.763 --> 47:09.864
He said, I'm buying a few books.

47:09.884 --> 47:11.845
And I said, have you got a dinner date?

47:11.865 --> 47:12.186
He said, no.

47:12.206 --> 47:13.947
And I said, well, let me go to dinner.

47:14.007 --> 47:17.991
So I took him to a kind of a theatrical hangout in New York, the Palm, which you were doing.

47:18.651 --> 47:20.032
And he got a picture of that.

47:20.052 --> 47:20.693
Did they have it again?

47:20.793 --> 47:22.174
The Palm, P-A-L-M.

47:22.535 --> 47:23.736
It's a steak joint in New York.

47:23.756 --> 47:25.277
It's all about the bakery.

47:25.527 --> 47:33.454
And there was a sale coming up, and I asked him about a Dickens item, and he said, I wouldn't buy that.

47:34.115 --> 47:38.078
And I said, well, I know you wouldn't buy it, because he was such a sticker on condition.

47:38.359 --> 47:41.241
He wouldn't buy anything that wasn't terrific.

47:41.261 --> 47:43.824
And I said, you wouldn't buy it, but I haven't got it.

47:44.044 --> 47:44.504
You have.

47:45.065 --> 47:46.626
And he said, yeah, that's not a very good copy.

47:46.646 --> 47:47.567
He said, I wouldn't buy it.

47:47.587 --> 47:48.167
So I said, OK.

47:48.728 --> 47:51.350
So then another item came to mind, and I said, well, what about this?

47:51.551 --> 47:53.172
He said, I wouldn't buy that either.

47:54.552 --> 47:55.353
And I said, really?

47:55.593 --> 47:55.953
Why not?

47:56.013 --> 47:58.636
He said, well, you're forcing me to tell you something.

47:58.656 --> 47:59.036
I said, what?

48:00.057 --> 48:03.300
He said, I've willed my Dickens collection to you.

48:04.081 --> 48:04.881
I said, my God.

48:04.941 --> 48:08.625
He said, I know my Dickens collection will have a good call.

48:08.645 --> 48:09.686
That's a wonderful story.

48:09.706 --> 48:10.607
He said, you're from Dayton.

48:10.727 --> 48:11.487
I'm from Dayton.

48:11.667 --> 48:12.608
I haven't got any airs.

48:13.329 --> 48:15.471
My books are going to the universities.

48:15.491 --> 48:17.853
I'm going to check this guy out, huh?

48:18.073 --> 48:19.635
I have to check this guy out.

48:19.675 --> 48:21.256
Most of his books went to Stanford.

48:21.276 --> 48:22.197
The other one went to Lilly.

48:22.480 --> 48:24.222
We're going to be at Stanford and Lillard.

48:24.242 --> 48:24.983
Stanford and Lillard.

48:25.003 --> 48:26.225
Well, what's Stanford?

48:26.385 --> 48:28.267
Well, it's the source of his wealth, you know.

48:28.308 --> 48:41.064
Yes, he was the general manager of the best department store in Dayton, which in itself doesn't sound like it could make a lot of money, but it was called Rikes, R-I-K-E-S.

48:41.084 --> 48:44.629
And Rikes was bought out by a federated department store on a stocking street.

48:45.630 --> 48:50.516
And Kenyon told me, he said, you know, I have Rikes stock that I paid a dollar for, some of it.

48:50.857 --> 48:51.998
And he said, in the exchange,

48:52.450 --> 48:53.571
Kenyon became a real man.

48:54.693 --> 48:56.956
And he had no other hobbies other than books.

48:57.997 --> 48:59.519
That sounds like it was a passion with him.

48:59.619 --> 49:00.040
Or what?

49:00.440 --> 49:06.709
And he told us that he became a book collector because it's something you could do by yourself.

49:06.729 --> 49:10.934
As Bill said, he had no brothers and sisters.

49:11.014 --> 49:11.455
Nobody.

49:11.955 --> 49:14.999
And none of his friends were interested in book collecting.

49:15.019 --> 49:17.783
People he had, friends that were art collectors and whatnot.

49:18.134 --> 49:20.217
And we, so we loved.

49:20.397 --> 49:26.846
And we had, we, the son of Collective is less than about 50% with his talent.

49:26.906 --> 49:32.834
We obviously continued our friendship and actually started doing things together.

49:32.874 --> 49:36.740
We went to, I was going to make a movie in Illinois.

49:37.541 --> 49:39.263
And I also was going to make a movie in Paris.

49:40.325 --> 49:46.453
And I said to Kenyon, why don't you come over to Illinois when we're shooting, and it's only a 300 mile drive, and visit us.

49:46.720 --> 49:48.703
He said, no, I don't want to do that, but I'll come to Paris.

49:50.004 --> 50:01.099
So we took an Alaskan cruise with Willie for 12 or 14 days there, and we became very good friends.

50:01.119 --> 50:09.509
And one of the things I started to do when it was possible, I would stop in Dayton on the way back from New York or in the way to New York and have dinner with Kenyon.

50:11.392 --> 50:16.238
And on this particular occasion, I called him in New York and said,

50:16.842 --> 50:17.983
going back, can you have dinner?"

50:18.003 --> 50:18.764
And he said, sure, come in.

50:18.784 --> 50:21.206
We'll have dinner tomorrow night, which was a Friday night.

50:21.226 --> 50:31.237
So, I flew in on Friday, and we always had a drink of scotch in the library, and a friend of us had come over and inherited his shoes.

50:31.257 --> 50:33.719
And Ken had said to me, when I got there, I'm not feeling too bad.

50:33.739 --> 50:37.423
And I said, well, why don't we not go to dinner?

50:37.443 --> 50:38.404
I don't know.

50:38.424 --> 50:41.447
We go out and get something, or I'll bring something in.

50:41.467 --> 50:44.250
His housekeeper was off that night.

50:45.496 --> 50:47.599
He said, no, no, we're going to go to dinner.

50:47.839 --> 50:49.342
He said, let's rest.

50:49.362 --> 50:49.883
In Paris.

50:50.864 --> 50:51.425
In Paris.

50:52.306 --> 50:52.486
Oh.

50:53.909 --> 50:57.694
So we both rested.

50:58.355 --> 51:02.882
We got up about 6 o'clock, and Harry Gouchier, his character, came over.

51:02.902 --> 51:07.088
And we were sitting as we were sitting now, and Kenny got up and walked out of the room.

51:07.108 --> 51:09.932
And I said to Harry, what's now with Kenny?

51:10.694 --> 51:11.615
We just got to walk out.

51:12.196 --> 51:13.277
And he said, I don't know.

51:13.298 --> 51:14.459
I said, well, I'm going to check him.

51:14.539 --> 51:14.980
So I went back.

51:15.770 --> 51:18.554
and called his name a couple of times, there was no response.

51:18.715 --> 51:22.100
And I went into his bedroom, and he was on the floor.

51:22.120 --> 51:25.645
And we had paramedics and everything else, but he was there.

51:26.747 --> 51:27.649
And you were with him?

51:27.669 --> 51:28.089
I was with him.

51:28.330 --> 51:31.715
I mean, there's so many coincidence in this story.

51:33.297 --> 51:40.489
So Harry, who knew his lawyer, got him on the phone and said, Mr. Science just died, and put me on.

51:42.912 --> 51:43.954
And

51:44.778 --> 51:46.240
I said to the lawyer, I don't know what to do.

51:46.260 --> 51:47.541
I said, I'm in this house alone.

51:47.561 --> 51:48.503
The housekeeper's on.

51:48.723 --> 51:49.724
All of his books are here.

51:50.425 --> 51:51.166
All of his jewelry.

51:51.867 --> 51:53.068
I don't know what else is in this house.

51:53.108 --> 51:53.569
What do I do?

51:53.589 --> 51:54.370
He said, stay there.

51:54.931 --> 51:55.672
You're in the will.

51:56.553 --> 51:57.274
It's okay.

51:57.935 --> 51:59.216
I'll authorize you're staying there.

52:00.197 --> 52:03.782
And he said, I'll come out tomorrow and talk to you.

52:04.042 --> 52:08.908
So I stayed there, and I had a terrible experience, and the housekeeper arrived in the morning with the groceries to make our breakfast.

52:08.928 --> 52:10.891
And I said, well, let's just talk about that.

52:11.051 --> 52:12.693
A dear, sweet man.

52:13.814 --> 52:14.295
He happened.

52:14.748 --> 52:26.581
who was the regimentation of his life, because he budgeted so much each year for books, I mean, you know, so much for cars, so much for travel.

52:27.843 --> 52:37.754
Anyway, the end of this story is that Peggy and I have inherited his deconstruction, which is held in trust for our daughter, who's how we are.

52:39.236 --> 52:43.000
And he directly willed her his entire Montprincon,

52:44.313 --> 52:51.309
We think that he willed her the collection because he did not want it broken up.

52:52.492 --> 52:54.998
Couldn't bear the thought of Chuckleberry Finn.
