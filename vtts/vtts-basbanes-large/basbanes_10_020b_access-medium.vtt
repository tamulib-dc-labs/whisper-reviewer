WEBVTT

00:04.283 --> 00:10.812
6,000 bucks, we got it.

00:10.973 --> 00:11.413
Wow.

00:11.433 --> 00:12.835
6,000 bucks.

00:13.136 --> 00:16.881
So we didn't go as much.

00:16.981 --> 00:19.224
Oh, that's good.

00:19.244 --> 00:20.847
We stayed for lunch.

00:20.867 --> 00:26.595
So anyway, you can take a look at it there.

00:27.352 --> 00:30.636
He was at the Frankfurt Book Fair this fall.

00:30.696 --> 00:32.419
Is he going to the Leipzig Fair, do you think?

00:32.679 --> 00:33.480
I'm sure he will.

00:34.241 --> 00:38.446
I've been invited at their expense to go to the Leipzig Fair in March, and I think I'll go.

00:38.466 --> 00:39.868
If you ask him, you'll probably need him there.

00:43.293 --> 00:49.501
He gave me copies, both of his current business cards and of one he had during the war, which is kind of cute.

00:49.741 --> 00:52.244
This could be everything you need right there, too.

00:52.264 --> 00:55.789
Well, I think one of his numbers, I think, has changed.

00:56.393 --> 00:58.075
Maybe it was just Xerox.

00:58.095 --> 01:00.379
Yeah, it was Xerox, yeah.

01:00.399 --> 01:03.002
And this was his card during the war.

01:06.688 --> 01:09.672
This card has been printed in a way.

01:13.037 --> 01:14.579
I'd love to have copies of both of you.

01:14.699 --> 01:15.921
One class of those copies.

01:16.061 --> 01:18.845
Anyway, his English is terrific.

01:18.985 --> 01:20.087
He's also a publisher.

01:20.447 --> 01:23.852
What do you call him, Mr. Shachin?

01:24.592 --> 01:27.796
Yeah, there it is.

01:27.816 --> 01:30.800
S with a thing, which would be for the shed and sugar.

01:32.222 --> 01:37.349
I-C-L-S-K-H-I-N-P-A-S with a thingy.

01:37.769 --> 01:39.632
P-A-S with a thingy.

01:41.013 --> 01:41.334
P-A-S-H-I-C.

01:41.494 --> 01:42.295
P-A-S-H-I-C.

01:42.495 --> 01:46.320
His first name is Payip.

01:46.340 --> 01:47.141
P-A-P-O-L-D.

01:47.222 --> 01:53.590
With a J. It's pronounced as a Y. Anyway, he's a very clever guy.

01:53.610 --> 01:53.670
Oh.

01:54.680 --> 02:03.390
Anyway, he can also probably help you in negotiating the photo life on this, because he knows all the other publishers in Sarajevo.

02:05.833 --> 02:06.994
Good.

02:07.214 --> 02:08.736
Well, this here is what?

02:08.756 --> 02:10.058
This is his list of books?

02:10.518 --> 02:14.383
Yeah, that's just his list of books at the Sarajevo Book Fair.

02:16.085 --> 02:17.506
The Sarajevo Book Fair.

02:18.127 --> 02:18.207
Yep.

02:19.013 --> 02:23.622
Is there a new national library in Croatia now?

02:23.642 --> 02:24.765
Is that by contrast?

02:24.785 --> 02:28.252
Well, no, they always had a national library in Zagreb.

02:28.352 --> 02:30.877
All the republics had their own national libraries.

02:31.519 --> 02:35.567
But the one in Zagreb has been extensively renovated.

02:35.868 --> 02:37.751
So they have a beautiful new facility.

02:37.952 --> 02:38.052
Yeah.

02:39.112 --> 02:42.035
And they have their own web page as well.

02:43.037 --> 02:50.165
I can give you the name of somebody who is well-connected with them, a Croatian librarian in Canada.

02:52.007 --> 02:54.530
What's their attitude to all of this, I wonder?

02:54.810 --> 02:55.812
The library people.

02:56.713 --> 03:03.220
Well, the Croatian National Library is actually providing a good deal of assistance to the Bosnia National Library now.

03:03.240 --> 03:06.524
It should be noted, actually.

03:07.525 --> 03:08.967
For example, the

03:09.470 --> 03:31.985
new automated systems, you know, the computer stuff, the software, is something that was developed for the lab lab, and it's being now applied to the new lab lab in Sarajevo in terms of institution, you know, structure.

03:33.207 --> 03:36.692
That Georgian thing, you say if I call the Harvard University Press Office,

03:37.212 --> 03:39.115
Uh, they should be able to do it.

03:39.135 --> 03:42.620
Also, you can talk to anybody that's hoping to... I'm having lunch with Roger Stoddard today.

03:42.660 --> 03:43.361
I'll ask Roger.

03:43.982 --> 03:45.564
Yeah, you would know all about it, I guess.

03:47.146 --> 03:49.610
Uh, but I think it was even written up in your time.

03:51.933 --> 03:54.096
I'll do a search as a... I was away.

03:54.116 --> 03:56.119
I was away a lot of this summer doing research.

03:56.800 --> 03:58.423
I'll bet I was away when this thing came down.

04:00.946 --> 04:01.046
Good.

04:01.807 --> 04:07.135
The, uh, you were asking us, you were asking about the assistance of the project, and, uh,

04:07.688 --> 04:17.737
This probably doesn't play a role in what you're writing about, but we've discovered our major challenge now is funding.

04:18.018 --> 04:35.434
Needless to say, I'm not, you know, not fed up or experienced in the ways of fundraising, though it was in Carol's last essay which elicited the one major private donation.

04:36.207 --> 05:05.387
to the project, a gentleman by the name of Lizzie Coolidge, of the Coolidge of Massachusetts, and there'll be lots of them around, called up, and I received a call, and when it became clear that he was speaking as a representative of a family foundation, I suggested that he contacted safer people,

05:05.722 --> 05:21.358
The upshot of that ultimately was a $20,000 donation, which covered the... Jeff, is Mr. Kovich... No, no, he's no longer... Yeah, I think that was only during this brief period.

05:21.378 --> 05:22.479
I'll check it out then.

05:22.499 --> 05:26.943
I mean, he probably won't play in anything.

05:26.963 --> 05:28.285
It's the Susky Foundation.

05:28.305 --> 05:29.406
It's the Family Foundation.

05:29.426 --> 05:30.507
What's the name?

05:30.827 --> 05:31.107
B-U-S-K-Y.

05:31.528 --> 05:31.628
Yeah.

05:32.148 --> 05:37.595
No, I don't think that that's been sort of a privilege information for a long time.

05:39.357 --> 05:39.817
It's fine.

05:39.837 --> 05:40.278
You got help.

05:40.859 --> 05:47.667
He's not the only contributor by any... No, but that was a contribution in a scale far beyond anything else in the industry.

05:47.687 --> 05:50.310
So mostly you're getting $1,500 donations probably.

05:50.350 --> 05:58.240
Yeah, that's sort of... And for a while, you see, because we weren't really under way,

05:58.895 --> 06:20.599
uh the uh the donations were being sent to the saevo foundation rather than to uh projects so a lot of the smaller foundation uh we sent elsewhere uh what this did permit was the uh the point person at favor to

06:20.984 --> 06:35.281
It permitted, therefore, the establishment of the office, Sarajevo office there, and the nomination of Kamal Bakacic as the head of St.

06:35.301 --> 06:37.003
Louis Bosnia.

06:37.304 --> 06:43.431
And it also permitted the purchase of the book, the first container book, to go.

06:43.748 --> 06:45.911
When did that go?

06:46.091 --> 06:46.632
What year?

06:47.353 --> 06:49.095
I used to know exactly.

06:49.136 --> 06:51.739
It arrived December 29th, 1996.

06:53.361 --> 06:55.124
Oh, so it's very easy.

06:55.144 --> 06:56.786
Oh, yeah, thank you.

06:56.946 --> 06:58.769
Oh, is she on the line right now?

06:58.809 --> 07:01.513
No, I said you'd call her back.

07:01.833 --> 07:02.775
Yes, yes.

07:03.496 --> 07:03.836
Thank you.

07:04.477 --> 07:07.581
Sorry, this looks like you must have worked on.

07:07.601 --> 07:09.123
Sorry, no, this is more important.

07:11.026 --> 07:12.388
When will you consider your...

07:13.364 --> 07:16.110
I mean, is this a commitment both of you have?

07:16.130 --> 07:19.918
I mean, I think it's basically an indefinite commitment.

07:19.999 --> 07:29.339
I mean, you know, Andrade is particularly engaged in the documentation and publicity regarding cultural constructions.

07:29.359 --> 07:32.065
I have been...

07:32.433 --> 07:57.445
in the logistics of the library donation process, I managed to persuade OCLC in another of those to agree to provide, on the basis of lists of ISDN numbers from the University Presses, complete bibliographic information on all the donated books.

07:57.813 --> 08:09.852
interested in conservation preservation issues, there being not only destroyed books in Bosnia, but books which survived and books which remain threatened for one reason or another.

08:10.714 --> 08:24.816
And when Andrea Markov became involved in such an incredibly productive way, it sort of turned me on to renew efforts I started last year to elicit interest in paper conservators.

08:25.133 --> 08:29.729
Have you talked to Diane Crest at the Library of Congress?

08:29.749 --> 08:30.271
No, I haven't.

08:30.331 --> 08:31.977
I talked to a whole group of people.

08:31.997 --> 08:32.960
John Dean at Cornell.

08:33.141 --> 08:36.392
These are all people who ran us right up.

08:36.895 --> 08:38.337
front edge, cutting edge.

08:38.417 --> 08:40.561
I mean, who are interested in this kind of... They do it.

08:40.581 --> 08:42.765
Dalin Preston's charge of preservation as well.

08:42.905 --> 08:43.566
No, no, no, no.

08:43.606 --> 08:46.330
But I mean, who are interested in this sort of overseeing the system?

08:46.390 --> 08:47.192
Well, I hope so.

08:47.212 --> 08:47.693
Why not?

08:47.713 --> 08:56.246
I mean... Because I did talk to a couple of people who professed interest that at that time did not have time.

08:56.747 --> 09:01.154
I have one possible volunteer at this point who I've been in correspondence with lately.

09:01.335 --> 09:03.358
The point being that, as with Andy Marto,

09:03.592 --> 09:14.164
She elicited donations, money to support her trip, and went for a month to provide training to people at the National Library.

09:14.184 --> 09:18.329
She's the woman, Andrea... From Minneapolis, the person who did the prepositions.

09:18.509 --> 09:24.475
Okay, Andrea sent me her letter, so I helped her, yeah.

09:25.096 --> 09:30.843
Anyway, where did that go?

09:31.543 --> 09:32.164
Let's go.

09:33.393 --> 09:35.856
Is it something that you gave me?

09:36.036 --> 09:37.438
No, I showed you that album.

09:37.518 --> 09:44.446
You put it back in a pocket.

09:44.627 --> 09:49.492
I think it worked well.

09:53.177 --> 10:03.349
That's your letterhead there?

10:03.785 --> 10:05.207
That's her letterhead.

10:05.227 --> 10:10.493
Actually, this is the letterhead of the Minneapolis Public Library.

10:11.935 --> 10:17.723
She sent a copy of... That's her own address, actually.

10:17.743 --> 10:22.689
She sent me a very real-time picture.

10:22.709 --> 10:30.178
She just sent me a picture of the college outside area with feathers in your back.

10:30.198 --> 10:31.480
I think this is her...

10:31.730 --> 10:42.547
But if you're curious, there's a copy here of one of the letters she sent out to elicit donations.

10:42.567 --> 10:49.237
And she really is an articulate exponent of the cause.

10:49.257 --> 10:50.799
And if you'd like it, I can get that.

10:50.819 --> 10:51.821
Yeah, absolutely.

10:51.841 --> 10:54.144
It's a fantastic couple of things.

10:54.164 --> 10:57.249
So if you want, I can go and put a copy on it for you.

10:57.269 --> 10:58.090
Oh, that's okay.

10:58.110 --> 10:59.813
I've got...

11:01.160 --> 11:08.196
I'm going to start writing this.

11:08.497 --> 11:18.780
And it's all, believe me, all this other stuff we're talking about, about Georgia, and it all works in... What I like is a case study.

11:19.267 --> 11:21.269
Well, it's very interesting.

11:21.529 --> 11:23.171
You're kind of like a political activist.

11:23.191 --> 11:23.652
I know that.

11:23.812 --> 11:27.135
News item is a description of the Georgia Archives.

11:27.335 --> 11:27.856
Oh, great.

11:27.876 --> 11:28.156
Oh, great.

11:28.176 --> 11:29.257
Well, that's terrific.

11:29.277 --> 11:31.099
But ask them about it.

11:31.399 --> 11:34.202
I know the Harvard News Office had a release on it.

11:34.743 --> 11:37.766
On loan to Harvard until 2004 from Georgia.

11:37.826 --> 11:40.809
But Harvard decided to retire in 1997.

11:42.331 --> 11:42.631
Wow.

11:43.492 --> 11:45.514
That is so good.

11:45.534 --> 11:46.575
Contact Houghton Library.

11:47.136 --> 11:47.616
Good.

11:47.636 --> 11:48.497
I'll ask about you.

11:48.848 --> 11:49.689
Thanks, I guess.

11:49.709 --> 11:50.310
That's wonderful.

11:51.751 --> 11:52.992
Thirty-five boxes to it.

11:53.012 --> 11:55.055
So it was all microfilm.

11:55.075 --> 11:57.137
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

11:57.157 --> 11:59.599
Harvard kept the microfilms and returned the original.

11:59.940 --> 12:00.300
Okay.

12:00.380 --> 12:01.782
So Harvard kept the copy.

12:03.023 --> 12:03.864
They kept the microfilm.

12:03.884 --> 12:05.205
Archival microfilm copy.

12:05.686 --> 12:11.212
And then this is the material that they returned, apparently.

12:11.232 --> 12:14.435
Well, it says, suddenly, thorough correspondence, memorandum, statistical data.

12:14.475 --> 12:17.218
This collection documents the Georgian government's activities

12:17.620 --> 12:21.884
for military affairs to trade in itself upon its Declaration of Independence in 1921.

12:22.765 --> 12:28.531
A keynote for those interested in Soviet history are the Republic of Georgia's relations with the Soviet government during this time.

12:28.551 --> 12:29.211
That's wonderful.

12:29.411 --> 12:34.476
And then they took its great exile in Paris, somehow survived World War II.

12:36.478 --> 12:45.387
And then I think quite late in the game, I think maybe as late as the 60s, as they decided to impress their survivors.

12:45.407 --> 12:46.188
That's very interesting.

12:46.208 --> 12:47.509
There's Stalin as a Georgian.

12:48.097 --> 12:52.423
Yeah, but Georgians are rather ambivalent about him.

12:52.644 --> 12:56.970
I'm sure they are ambivalent, but I'm surprised he didn't make an effort there.

12:56.990 --> 12:58.672
I'm sure he did.

12:58.833 --> 13:01.537
I mean, Stalin was grabbing everything in his audience.

13:02.418 --> 13:15.437
I mean, one of the most discreditable episodes of our activities after World War II is the brief interval between the surrender of Germany and the outset of the Cold War.

13:16.362 --> 13:32.238
Stalin made the demand that all natives of areas included within the Soviet Union were among the millions of people in displaced person camps in the American occupation zone be handed over.

13:32.258 --> 13:46.352
And we handed over not only the former Russian POWs that Hitler has had, but also emigres, people who have fled

13:47.227 --> 13:56.316
in 1917 and had lived for 20 years in, you know, 20, 30 years in Western Europe.

13:57.256 --> 14:05.104
And for the sake of our praying friendship with Stalin, they handed them over and those that weren't immediately shot were sent off to the gulag.

14:05.204 --> 14:09.488
Millions of them, a lot of them, killed themselves by jumping off the shit on the way home.

14:09.508 --> 14:10.349
Is this documented?

14:10.369 --> 14:14.753
Yeah, there's a book by, I think, Holter's son.

14:16.657 --> 14:25.947
There's also a really searing TV documentary called The Orders from Above on the British World in this forced refatuation.

14:26.387 --> 14:31.353
But Stalin was also after all kinds of other things.

14:31.633 --> 14:38.860
One person you might want to talk to, actually, at Harvard is a gentleman named Igor Shevchenko, who was a Ukrainian in one of these camps.

14:39.121 --> 14:41.824
He somehow managed to avoid being returned by force.

14:43.646 --> 14:45.988
He, at that point, was a young student.

14:46.762 --> 14:50.446
And this has a book angle.

14:51.567 --> 14:56.471
He did the first Ukrainian translation of Animal Farm.

14:56.672 --> 14:56.872
Wow.

14:57.633 --> 14:59.735
In the camps, published it clandestinely.

15:00.275 --> 15:02.537
Had it distributed throughout the Allied camps.

15:03.919 --> 15:05.600
Stalin was absolutely furious.

15:05.660 --> 15:12.027
He demanded the Americans search and find for the author of the subversive book and suppress the book.

15:12.087 --> 15:15.090
The Americans were active in trying to suppress the book.

15:15.110 --> 15:16.431
Professor Shevchenko who did this.

15:17.035 --> 15:18.217
And he's here at Harvard?

15:18.277 --> 15:19.760
He's an emeritus at Harvard.

15:19.800 --> 15:20.742
He's still around the area.

15:22.264 --> 15:29.477
And he did the translation under a pseudonym.

15:29.638 --> 15:31.421
Where was he at this time?

15:31.461 --> 15:34.446
He was, I think, in the area in a U.S.

15:34.887 --> 15:35.989
guarded BP camp.

15:36.475 --> 15:43.383
But he managed to elude both the Americans and the KGB, which was cooperating with the Americans.

15:43.403 --> 15:48.949
But he did this translation, and then how did he manage to get it published and printed and distributed, I wonder?

15:50.350 --> 15:54.255
Well, I'm sure it was a fairly clinical publication.

15:56.357 --> 15:58.800
But it's a fascinating book story.

15:58.980 --> 15:59.260
Yeah.

15:59.611 --> 16:06.703
especially where you quote Orwell in 1984 about, we don't worry about the future and the present, we worry about the past.

16:06.763 --> 16:11.070
And it feeds right into the whole cultural genocide context.

16:12.392 --> 16:20.626
That's what Orwell says in 1984 is that you destroy the documents from the past.

16:20.646 --> 16:21.467
That's how you...

16:22.004 --> 16:30.058
On the anniversary of its publication, there was some newspaper articles about it, but I'm sure you'd be delighted to talk to him.

16:30.078 --> 16:31.541
I'd love to talk to him.

16:31.561 --> 16:31.861
This is great.

16:31.901 --> 16:32.582
This is wonderful.

16:32.763 --> 16:33.985
Yeah, here he is.

16:34.005 --> 16:35.127
Oh, could you spell his name?

16:35.547 --> 16:40.977
Yeah, here he is.

16:40.997 --> 16:41.858
What's the first name?

16:41.918 --> 16:44.022
I-H-O-R.

16:44.623 --> 16:46.847
Ihor Shevchenko.

16:47.350 --> 17:17.357
S-E-V-C-E-N-K-O S-E-V-C-E-N-K-O S-E-V-C-E-N-K-O S-E-V-C-E-N-K-O S-E-V-C-E-N-K-O S-E-V-C-E-N-K-O S-E-V-C-E-N-K-O S-E-VC-E-N-K-O S-E-VC-E-N-K-O S-E-VC-E-N-K-O S-E-VC-E-N-K-O S-E-VC-E-N-K-O S-E-VC-E-N-K-O S-E-VC-E-N-K-O S-E-VC-E-N-K-O S-E-VC-

17:18.248 --> 17:20.271
They put it in touch so we could do it formally.

17:23.336 --> 17:28.824
We can also do this through the Ukrainian Research Institute.

17:29.425 --> 17:37.056
Anyway, he did the first Ukrainian translation of Animal Farm.

17:37.157 --> 17:37.978
That's wonderful.

17:39.420 --> 17:40.522
That smells great.

17:40.642 --> 17:43.446
Whoever would have thought it'd be a Ukrainian translation.

17:43.763 --> 17:49.912
And, you know, there were more than a million Ukrainian DPs in these camps.

17:50.493 --> 17:51.655
And they snapped this stuff up.

17:51.675 --> 17:53.117
They knew exactly what it was.

17:53.137 --> 17:56.743
So what did they do with their archives and documents?

17:57.724 --> 18:02.031
Do you really want to know?

18:02.091 --> 18:02.692
Yeah.

18:02.792 --> 18:09.101
What do I really want to know?

18:09.121 --> 18:09.602
That's funny.

18:10.932 --> 18:17.982
Where do I put that directory with her?

18:21.246 --> 18:34.485
She is still at the institute, which she might be, has for several decades run a project tracking down what happened to archives in Europe after World War II.

18:35.126 --> 18:37.269
She ran a project.

18:37.509 --> 18:38.931
I'll call her for those.

18:39.805 --> 18:40.967
Patricia Grimstad.

18:41.908 --> 18:42.970
It's S-D-E-A-D.

18:43.070 --> 18:43.611
Now let's do it.

18:43.671 --> 18:44.272
Patricia.

18:45.354 --> 18:52.806
Her name is Patricia Kennedy Grimstad, right?

18:52.826 --> 18:53.908
Yeah.

18:55.711 --> 18:56.692
G-R-I-M-S-D-A-D.

18:57.614 --> 18:58.034
S-D-E-A-D?

18:58.054 --> 18:58.255
Right.

18:59.797 --> 19:03.443
And she is at the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute.

19:04.966 --> 19:06.488
Harvard Ukrainian.

19:07.210 --> 19:12.318
Research Institute, and she's Dr. Grimstein.

19:12.578 --> 19:14.921
Can I mention that we spoke?

19:14.941 --> 19:17.024
You've got a letter?

19:17.125 --> 19:18.947

19:18.967 --> 19:22.613
Do you have your email address on it?

19:22.853 --> 19:24.255
This is her letter.

19:24.556 --> 19:28.982

20:33.012 --> 20:34.654
You may have both of these.

20:34.674 --> 20:47.032
This is... Oh, shoot.

21:18.040 --> 21:18.941
Oh, good.

21:19.081 --> 21:21.224
I don't have to go get this out of the library.

21:23.866 --> 21:25.588
It's a French-Canadian journal.

21:25.957 --> 21:30.685
You can start reading it.

21:31.786 --> 21:40.740
Thank you.

21:43.204 --> 21:51.778
Whoops, I didn't do it.
