00:02.849 --> 00:19.012
a model but not a straitjacket for the typical client for the Changing Lives program is someone who experiences repetitive charges for unnecessary crimes.

00:22.637 --> 00:32.451
Usually the judge has a little alternative but to sentence such a client to jail for a period of anywhere up to two, two and a half years.

00:33.595 --> 00:36.439
The client has to be committed to change.

00:36.699 --> 00:50.179
In other words, in some sense he has to have hit bottom and is dissatisfied with the repetitive nature of the trouble he gets into and has a positive desire to change.

00:50.199 --> 00:55.286
He has to convince the judge of this.

00:55.326 --> 01:01.375
Needs enough reading ability to obtain

01:02.131 --> 01:05.395
and finish a 200-page book in a two-week period.

01:08.719 --> 01:10.542
And he needs transportation to the program.

01:13.866 --> 01:16.289
So that's the model.

01:16.369 --> 01:20.434
How do you get involved?

01:20.454 --> 01:21.435
I'm a defense attorney.

01:22.797 --> 01:31.648
The carrot for the defense attorney is a good judge will give, will suspend or

01:32.776 --> 01:37.140
not impose a jail sentence in return for placing the client on probation.

01:38.162 --> 01:48.752
The judges that do this know that there's a substantial chance of and a very important improvement in the social functioning of the clients that are selected.

01:50.835 --> 02:00.044
Studies have been done indicating a recidivism rate of 20 percent as compared to 45 or higher, which is amazing.

02:00.084 --> 02:01.045
The group chosen

02:01.717 --> 02:15.411
tend to become arrested and involved in the district court system on some level, anywhere from annually to two or three times a year.

02:15.812 --> 02:17.213
Annually to two or three times a year.

02:17.814 --> 02:26.123
Anecdotally, many of the clients we meet exhibit a much stronger sense of self-confidence, self-worth.

02:26.543 --> 02:26.964
From reading?

02:27.845 --> 02:29.446
From reading and also from discussion.

02:29.486 --> 02:31.048
There are several elements here.

02:31.433 --> 02:35.256
that cannot be quantified very well.

02:35.296 --> 02:38.319
For instance, the setting in a university.

02:38.339 --> 02:45.866
Many of these men don't have GEDs, but when they enter the university on the first night, they ask themselves, why am I even here?

02:46.186 --> 02:49.489
When they leave tonight, they know they belong.

02:50.190 --> 02:54.433
They feel and they are able to complete a college-level English course.

02:55.154 --> 02:58.837
The presence of the judge, there's no judge here tonight, unfortunately.

02:58.877 --> 03:00.098
Judge Cain usually attends.

03:00.138 --> 03:00.799
He does, huh?

03:01.184 --> 03:04.088
He does, and he sits down as one of the men.

03:04.549 --> 03:05.590
Wow.

03:05.610 --> 03:08.655
As another student, another reader of the book.

03:09.696 --> 03:11.119
Does he participate in the discussion?

03:11.139 --> 03:12.400
Completely.

03:12.420 --> 03:14.323
Because I wish he were here tonight.

03:14.383 --> 03:16.446
He's extremely intelligent.

03:17.408 --> 03:24.698
His language is elevated, but he doesn't use that language or his intelligence to dominate or harm others.

03:24.718 --> 03:26.741
He uses it as part of... To intimidate, yeah.

03:26.962 --> 03:30.567
No, he brings everyone up.

03:32.099 --> 03:32.560
Okay.

03:33.902 --> 03:36.346
You can just tell me if his name is like this.

03:36.627 --> 03:38.450
Yeah, my name is Val.

03:38.590 --> 03:40.394
Actually, Wilder, Korea, but they call me Val.

03:40.454 --> 03:40.854
Okay.

03:43.058 --> 03:45.963
Your insights, it looks to me like you took this pretty seriously.

03:45.983 --> 03:48.047
Was it fear or was it pleasure for you?

03:48.147 --> 03:51.072
No, actually, I found out about the class.

03:51.313 --> 03:52.775
Like I said, I was in prison at the time.

03:52.815 --> 03:53.837
I read about it in the paper.

03:54.205 --> 03:55.928
I took it like I opened the paper.

03:55.968 --> 03:57.030
You wrote a paper about this?

03:57.050 --> 04:00.356
No, it was in the newspaper, an article about the program itself.

04:00.736 --> 04:00.997
Oh, yeah?

04:01.437 --> 04:03.000
Is this on the website?

04:03.020 --> 04:03.922
Is this something I can get?

04:04.382 --> 04:05.324
They do have a website.

04:05.584 --> 04:06.967
Okay, but is there a paper?

04:07.027 --> 04:07.888
No, no, no, no, no.

04:07.908 --> 04:09.752
There was an article about it in the newspaper.

04:09.772 --> 04:09.992
Oh, I know.

04:10.012 --> 04:10.673
You said you wrote a paper.

04:10.693 --> 04:11.134
No, no, no.

04:11.154 --> 04:12.336
There was an article about it.

04:12.516 --> 04:14.780
May I show you a couple more pictures?

04:14.800 --> 04:15.021
Yeah.

04:15.361 --> 04:18.086
Oh, you can take it right next to there, because that's where I'm from.

04:18.607 --> 04:19.909
It's ready.

04:21.458 --> 04:36.195
Yeah, I read an article about it, and while I was reading the article, it was just coincidence that that's the page that I happened to open the newspaper to, and I've seen something that's like changing lives to literature.

04:36.255 --> 04:49.069
Just the key word was literature, so I read about it, and then I seen that it was for people who have never been in trouble before that were, you know, potential good products of this program, like

04:49.319 --> 04:51.585
If I was to get in this program, it'd be good for me.

04:51.926 --> 04:55.294
Like I said, I wrote the letter to him and gave it to my lawyer.

04:55.314 --> 04:56.698
This is why you were in prison?

04:57.280 --> 04:57.360
Hmm?

04:57.380 --> 04:59.124
This is why you were incarcerated?

04:59.144 --> 05:02.854
I was incarcerated because of drugs.

05:03.195 --> 05:03.295
Yeah.

05:04.642 --> 05:06.625
While I was in there, I had a lot of time to think.

05:06.645 --> 05:08.367
I wasn't asking what it was for.

05:08.427 --> 05:09.068
You told me.

05:10.170 --> 05:10.911
I made mistakes.

05:11.131 --> 05:13.114
I was in prison because of drugs.

05:13.795 --> 05:15.918
While I was in there, I had a lot of time to reflect.

05:16.458 --> 05:18.080
I was a college student.

05:18.101 --> 05:19.442
Where did you go to school?

05:19.462 --> 05:21.665
I actually went in here.

05:21.806 --> 05:24.569
I was teaching in New Bedford High School.

05:24.770 --> 05:29.576
Things went wrong and I started making my little wrong decisions.

05:29.797 --> 05:30.818
That's where it landed me.

05:31.186 --> 05:44.123
So, the program basically, in the newspaper, the article is talking about how the program is designed for people who have never been in trouble before, to before they become a constant, and trapped in the revolving doors of the jail system to find a way to get out.

05:44.143 --> 05:53.215
So, like, I really wanted this program to do something for me, because I know that I've always been an educated young man, and, you know, I've made correct decisions.

05:54.597 --> 05:57.160
Excuse me.

05:58.726 --> 06:05.973
Yeah, so I thought that this program, you know, this could be a good book, right?

06:06.674 --> 06:07.495
I'll use this in a book.

06:07.915 --> 06:09.297
Yeah, sounds good.

06:09.317 --> 06:09.857
I'll buy the book.

06:10.138 --> 06:11.499
Well, I'll give you the book.

06:12.100 --> 06:12.780
All right.

06:12.800 --> 06:15.703
So, yeah, basically I thought, like, this program would be good for me.

06:16.204 --> 06:22.370
And like I told you, the first week I came, I researched the program a little bit online before I came in.

06:22.470 --> 06:26.995
And I had my own perceptions of what the program would be like as far as, um,

06:28.443 --> 06:30.766
Nice to meet you, man.

06:30.786 --> 06:32.249
Good to be on the program with you.

06:32.269 --> 06:32.729
Thank you.

06:32.990 --> 06:35.093
It was my pleasure being here, too.

06:35.133 --> 06:36.475
You're a very smart guy.

06:36.495 --> 06:36.976
You, too, man.

06:36.996 --> 06:37.637
Stay out of trouble.

06:37.697 --> 06:39.199
I don't want to see you in there.

06:39.219 --> 06:40.521
I never want to run into you in there.

06:40.541 --> 06:40.841
I didn't.

06:41.082 --> 06:43.706
I mean, this helped change my life in different ways.

06:43.726 --> 06:44.547
This changed my life.

06:44.567 --> 06:45.148
You know what I mean?

06:45.368 --> 06:46.850
Everyone's got their own way of being popular.

06:47.611 --> 06:48.713
I ain't going to be back in there.

06:48.893 --> 06:51.117
What was that you were just showing?

06:51.137 --> 06:52.419
I'm going to make a mistake.

06:52.579 --> 06:53.700
You know, I'm sure you can figure it out.

06:54.722 --> 06:55.463
It's one of those things.

06:56.185 --> 06:58.938
You take care of yourself.

06:58.958 --> 07:01.470
Everyone wants to try that end of that.

07:01.838 --> 07:02.599
That road of life.

07:02.979 --> 07:03.981
Yep, definitely.

07:04.201 --> 07:07.065
This program has been real good for the both of us.

07:07.105 --> 07:08.206
I came here and never knew this guy.

07:08.487 --> 07:10.670
Hopefully I run into you on good terms.

07:10.690 --> 07:11.010
Yeah.

07:11.090 --> 07:11.631
Definitely.

07:12.151 --> 07:12.973
Bobby is a friend of mine.

07:12.993 --> 07:15.296
That's the only time I'm going to be talking to him is hanging out with him.

07:15.776 --> 07:17.498
Well, you used to have your open case going, right?

07:17.799 --> 07:18.360
Yeah.

07:18.380 --> 07:20.142
I'll find out how you're going through Bobby.

07:20.422 --> 07:21.303
It'll be off in February.

07:21.344 --> 07:22.785
I'm out of here.

07:23.086 --> 07:25.309
I won't be here, but the end of next time I'll be gone.

07:25.449 --> 07:29.294
I'll be someplace warm for next Wednesday.

07:29.354 --> 07:30.215
All right, cool.

07:31.176 --> 07:31.677
Take it easy.

07:32.247 --> 07:34.089
So what do you want to do?

07:34.729 --> 07:37.171
Well, actually now... You've got a good future, man.

07:37.352 --> 07:39.474
You've got a good mind.

07:39.494 --> 07:40.915
I'm a professional reader.

07:40.975 --> 07:42.416
I've written four books.

07:43.457 --> 07:45.539
I've spent my life writing and reading.

07:45.559 --> 07:47.501
I'm currently writing a short story.

07:47.521 --> 07:50.924
I've got a pretty good eye for... I write poetry.

07:51.044 --> 07:52.485
I've been writing poetry since second grade.

07:52.505 --> 07:53.526
I'm 26 years old now.

07:53.566 --> 07:54.807
You're right on it.

07:54.887 --> 07:57.570
Your perceptions are really excellent.

07:58.130 --> 08:02.254
My main goal right now is to take my mistakes that I've made and

08:02.774 --> 08:04.096
teach young kids.

08:04.116 --> 08:07.220
I'm working on opening my own non-profit organization.

08:07.260 --> 08:10.704
I've given Professor Robert Waxlow the blueprint to it.

08:11.325 --> 08:13.928
His son is a lawyer and his brother is going to look over it for me.

08:13.969 --> 08:25.343
He has a judge that works in the juvenile court system that has money that's been allocated to her through certain grants to start a non-profit so I might be able to work with her.

08:25.383 --> 08:27.686
Do you use books as part of your... Yes, definitely.

08:28.347 --> 08:29.749
I wasn't planning on using books.

08:29.769 --> 08:32.072
I was planning on doing more tutoring

08:32.423 --> 08:37.410
helping kids with their actual schoolwork and all that and making sure they stay in school and decide to go to college and all that.

08:37.430 --> 08:40.996
But since I've been in this class, I feel like discussion.

08:42.218 --> 08:47.546
Reading and then having the discussion afterwards is a lot more better than just reading on its own.

08:47.686 --> 08:57.480
What you said there really struck me there is that you said that you're expecting to have what you had in college, which is we read the book and we come in and there's going to be one right answer.

08:57.561 --> 09:01.266
He's going to tell us what happened, but instead he came in and he challenged you to

09:01.533 --> 09:04.096
participate and give your own perceptions of what you read.

09:04.296 --> 09:04.516
Yes.

09:04.636 --> 09:06.278
And everybody had a different perception.

09:06.298 --> 09:07.119
And you thought that was cool.

09:07.159 --> 09:07.680
You liked that.

09:07.720 --> 09:08.260
That was cool.

09:08.300 --> 09:10.563
Yeah, that was definitely... Talk a little bit about that, if you don't mind.

09:10.663 --> 09:11.243
It's cool.

09:11.464 --> 09:19.973
It's like I was saying in the class that it's strange that you can have six different people or more read the same book.

09:20.654 --> 09:29.363
But yet, if you ask every single one of those people what they got from that book, everyone would have a different story.

09:29.680 --> 09:31.482
that came from that book.

09:31.663 --> 09:38.993
It's good, because... It's about the power of literature, because it has a way of impacting, or influencing, or resonating... Different people in different ways.

09:39.573 --> 09:46.282
And it shows how that person's particular background... You are what you do.

09:46.302 --> 09:47.284
You make what you read.

09:48.265 --> 09:56.596
Rather than... The writer could have his own intention, but when he sits down and he pens something in that book, he never knows.

09:57.317 --> 09:59.400
He can never imagine the

09:59.988 --> 10:07.804
power that book could have on different people because he writes it with one intention in mind, his perspective and his point of view.

10:08.004 --> 10:18.044
But the words that he puts down on paper, even though it's the same words that so many different people are reading, every single person is going to have their own perception of that book.

10:18.125 --> 10:19.347
I guess it's like a fingerprint.

10:19.478 --> 10:20.439
You know, two-hour life.

10:20.739 --> 10:21.640
Fantastic.

10:21.660 --> 10:23.582
And were there any favorites in the course?

10:24.023 --> 10:26.445
My favorite was The Old Man and the Sea.

10:27.046 --> 10:29.188
Oh, and what was there in particular about that?

10:29.208 --> 10:45.124
It was about an old man who, he had his beliefs and, you know, even though things weren't always going right for him and, you know, everybody would make fun of him and, you know, he was failing at everything else and he was getting old, he wouldn't give up.

10:45.264 --> 10:45.825
He was a fighter.

10:46.465 --> 10:47.967
And, you know, basically,

10:48.571 --> 10:58.826
You know, right now, I'm at a point in my life where, in comparison to maybe four or five years ago, where I was doing good, you know, I was president of associations here at the school.

10:58.926 --> 11:03.473
I was actively involved in a lot of political things on campus, and, you know, I was working.

11:03.533 --> 11:09.281
I had a nice job already in my major, and I was working, and, you know, I had a nice car, and I had my whole family behind me.

11:09.822 --> 11:13.407
And now it's four years later, you know, I'm just being released from prison.

11:13.447 --> 11:14.549
I don't have a car no more.

11:14.789 --> 11:16.091
How much time did you do?

11:16.111 --> 11:16.251
Mm-hmm.

11:16.271 --> 11:16.992
How much time did you do?

11:17.191 --> 11:21.216
I only did two months, but I'm only, like I said, I'm only out on bail right now.

11:21.236 --> 11:25.661
I'm still facing time complications.

11:26.723 --> 11:31.809
But this program is going to help me when I do go.

11:32.170 --> 11:36.094
And I was asked, being that I had a college background, when I first started this class.

11:36.395 --> 11:40.240
I'm the oldest one in the class, and I did have the college background.

11:40.300 --> 11:46.287
I was asked from the two professors and my probation officer to be the standout student.

11:47.077 --> 11:52.205
that was asked of me, and I said, that's what I'll do, and I feel that I've accomplished that.

11:52.746 --> 11:54.128
Where did you do your time?

11:54.269 --> 11:57.033
In that street correctional facility.

11:57.694 --> 11:57.895
Yes.

11:58.716 --> 12:02.021
Sucky thing was, it was right across the street from where I lived.

12:02.041 --> 12:04.285
Well, my aunt's house, but where I grew up in my aunt's house.

12:05.547 --> 12:07.570
So you say you're from the Cape Verde?

12:07.590 --> 12:09.073
Yes, I'm from the Cape Verde.

12:09.293 --> 12:10.114
How long have you been here?

12:10.375 --> 12:11.477
I've been here since 1981.

12:11.517 --> 12:13.540
I came when I was four years old.

12:14.448 --> 12:15.550
How do I get in touch with you?

12:15.570 --> 12:16.451
You got an email address?

12:16.471 --> 12:18.354
I can give you an email and my cell phone number.

12:18.794 --> 12:22.680
My name is Nick, N-I-C-T.

12:22.740 --> 12:37.180
My email is M-A-G-A-S-O-D-A-D-E at hotmail.com.

12:37.200 --> 12:41.506
And my cell phone is 774-201-915.

12:42.087 --> 12:42.868
Good.

12:43.169 --> 12:43.970
All right, excellent.

12:43.990 --> 12:44.952
I know you're going to run.

12:44.972 --> 12:55.106
And then, matasodadi, means this word means to miss something, and this word means to kill.

12:56.008 --> 12:58.291
So basically, kill the feeling of missing something.

12:58.952 --> 13:08.145
And it's a term we often use in my language, which for people that live here, who've migrated from their home, we want to kill the feeling of missing where we're from.

13:09.087 --> 13:11.029
So, matasodadi, so that's what they say.

13:11.230 --> 13:12.872
When you're going to vacation to Cape Verde,

13:13.460 --> 13:16.744
you're going there to kill the feeling of missing K. Brett.

13:17.425 --> 13:19.668
Have you been successful at that, do you think?

13:19.788 --> 13:21.810
Every time I go back, I've been back a few times.

13:21.870 --> 13:23.452
My father still isn't there.

13:23.472 --> 13:26.876
My father retired two years ago as the Secretary of Defense for K. Brett.

13:27.097 --> 13:27.297
Wow.

13:29.420 --> 13:31.823
Well, I think you're going to do it.

13:33.745 --> 13:36.588
I'm a pretty good judge of character, I have to say.

13:37.269 --> 13:42.015
I'm not saying I like being in jail, but being caught

13:42.400 --> 13:50.993
And going to jail for two months and having that time to reflect was the worst good thing that could have happened to me in my life.

13:51.013 --> 13:51.514
The worst good thing?

13:51.754 --> 13:52.956
The worst good thing.

13:52.976 --> 13:56.581
How long had you been misbehaving, shall we say?

13:56.601 --> 13:58.364
It had been a year, a year and a half.

13:59.505 --> 14:06.075
And in that year, like, I was the only one that failed to realize all the things I was losing.

14:06.195 --> 14:07.417
I lost my license.

14:07.437 --> 14:08.078
I lost my car.

14:08.439 --> 14:09.100
I lost my car.

14:09.781 --> 14:10.602
Almost lost my girl.

14:10.970 --> 14:12.451
I lost my family's faith in me.

14:12.972 --> 14:15.154
I lost, you know, a lot of friends, you know.

14:16.315 --> 14:19.798
I lost so many things, but it wasn't until I lost my freedom there.

14:20.378 --> 14:24.302
And was this drug use that you had?

14:24.322 --> 14:24.522
No.

14:24.722 --> 14:31.588
The thing that happened was, I... Don't mind my asking, don't... Prior to graduating college, I got a job in my major.

14:31.728 --> 14:34.551
I was working in Boston, making $43,000, living in the Beckford.

14:35.451 --> 14:38.114
And I worked there for a year and a half, and then I was laid off.

14:38.334 --> 14:39.475
So being young,

14:40.703 --> 14:44.046
I didn't know what to do with all that money, you know, making that much money.

14:44.086 --> 14:46.388
I was going out partying, wasting it, doing all this, doing all that.

14:46.808 --> 14:51.753
And then reality snapped back in because now I have to get another job.

14:51.773 --> 14:56.076
Another job, I didn't make one third of what I was making in Boston.

14:56.096 --> 15:08.107
So in order to continue to live the lifestyle I was living at $43,000, I had to do what I had to do, which wasn't the right decision.

15:08.127 --> 15:09.368
Prior to that, I had never smoked drugs.

15:09.388 --> 15:10.609
I never did drugs.

15:11.146 --> 15:12.808
So you never did them?

15:12.828 --> 15:14.210
No.

15:14.230 --> 15:15.591
I drink.

15:15.811 --> 15:16.733
Writers love to drink.

15:16.753 --> 15:17.814
That's what they say.

15:18.835 --> 15:21.378
It was basically something like that.

15:21.598 --> 15:27.325
I appreciate your honesty with me.

15:27.385 --> 15:34.653
They busted you down here, and so it goes.

15:34.674 --> 15:35.795
You've seen the light?

15:36.135 --> 15:36.816
I've seen the light.

15:37.100 --> 15:39.823
Since I've been out, I've been doing this.

15:39.884 --> 15:44.309
I'm working on getting back into school, finishing my last few credits that I owe.

15:45.050 --> 15:46.172
I've been going to church.

15:46.632 --> 15:47.133
I go to work.

15:47.433 --> 15:50.277
I don't want to wake up and go to work, but I go.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.079
And what kind of work did you see doing that?

15:52.099 --> 15:55.503
Well, now, you know, I've always had something to fall back on.

15:55.623 --> 15:59.589
First thing I did was when I was 16, I went and got licensed to be a barber because I was good at it.

16:00.189 --> 16:02.512
You know, back then, I used to do everything that I needed to do.

16:02.632 --> 16:06.297
Like, I could cut here, get a license, you know, do it the right way.

16:07.222 --> 16:09.345
You can read, you're good in school, go to college.

16:09.425 --> 16:09.885
I did that.

16:10.326 --> 16:13.870
And I won't use your full name in my piece.

16:13.910 --> 16:14.411
Yeah, okay.

16:14.451 --> 16:15.993
Maybe you should put the valve.

16:16.073 --> 16:17.595
And you don't mind my using your picture?

16:17.955 --> 16:20.338
No, I don't mind that at all.

16:20.558 --> 16:23.682
Yeah, I don't mind that at all.

16:23.762 --> 16:29.449
I want to let people know what I went through and the fact that

16:29.868 --> 16:30.809
I'm trying to make a change.

16:31.270 --> 16:32.251
I talk to a lot of people.

16:32.432 --> 16:33.453
I work in a Bible study.

16:33.493 --> 16:34.214
That's my medium.

16:34.615 --> 16:38.400
And can you definitely say that the books have helped you come out of this?

16:38.420 --> 16:40.002
Books and the programming itself.

16:40.783 --> 16:42.606
Because the book alone wouldn't have done it.

16:43.427 --> 16:44.268
It's the conversation.

16:46.131 --> 16:50.357
Like I said, you could read the book in class, pass it in and get a grade and leave.

16:50.523 --> 17:00.897
but you don't get that, you don't get the same thing out of the book until you just stuck it with other people and see that the same, other people read the same book in the same way, came wearing something different.

17:00.917 --> 17:01.338
That's great.

17:01.819 --> 17:02.119
Okay.

17:02.139 --> 17:03.901
Go meet your friend, your girlfriend.

17:07.126 --> 17:10.851
Mainly black.

17:10.931 --> 17:19.483
Dependency for people that are really close to the kind of ethnic background, black, African-American.

17:19.598 --> 17:23.329
I wish we had a better Spanish book.

17:23.349 --> 17:28.204
They identify a little bit with Santiago, but... For this course, yeah.

17:28.224 --> 17:31.093
Used house on Maringo Street for a woman.

17:31.327 --> 17:33.410
Yeah, Nick, I'm going to give you my card.

17:33.470 --> 17:34.772
I need to get going now.

17:35.012 --> 17:36.033
Well, I might.

17:36.234 --> 17:37.916
I probably definitely will be in touch.

17:38.016 --> 17:42.803
That number I drafted is my extension, so, you know, you get the automated thing, you can go direct to me.

17:43.183 --> 17:49.372
And, um... No, but I don't remember mine.

17:49.652 --> 17:51.194
But I'll give you my home email.

17:51.214 --> 17:52.356
Give me my home email.

17:52.416 --> 17:54.098
Not at all.

17:54.138 --> 17:55.440
What do you see?

17:56.041 --> 17:59.325
I know you had mentioned, the book sounds great, generally, what you think.

17:59.693 --> 18:04.368
You got most of the work done on your book already, right?

18:04.489 --> 18:04.589
Yeah.

18:04.609 --> 18:06.094
A chapter on Harold Lone.

18:06.716 --> 18:07.579
No, I see Harold.

18:07.679 --> 18:08.281
Harold.

18:08.442 --> 18:09.485
Harold.

18:10.027 --> 18:10.328
Harold.

18:10.814 --> 18:16.459
I worked him in with Helen Bendler, the woman at Harvard, and Christopher Ricks, who was there.

18:16.479 --> 18:17.680
Oh, yeah.

18:17.700 --> 18:19.162
It's a new book on Dylan.

18:19.182 --> 18:20.843
Yeah, well, I saw that book on Dylan.

18:20.883 --> 18:23.165
I thought he was treating him like poetry.

18:23.185 --> 18:24.106
Oh, yeah.

18:24.126 --> 18:25.447
And it's amazing.

18:25.888 --> 18:26.668
Well, whatever.

18:26.728 --> 18:27.749
He's a good copy.

18:28.090 --> 18:30.312
One of the best-read people in the world.

18:30.612 --> 18:32.193
Oh, absolutely.

18:32.213 --> 18:33.755
Yeah, please.

18:33.835 --> 18:34.495
Thanks a lot.

18:35.576 --> 18:37.578
Nice to meet you.

18:37.758 --> 18:38.419
Thank you.

18:38.579 --> 18:39.980
Have a great holiday.

18:40.100 --> 18:40.821
Yeah.

18:40.801 --> 19:01.801
as they try to impress each other and us with... Yeah, over the years, again, especially, this group is somewhat, you know, not the most typical group.

19:01.921 --> 19:08.968
You know, the core group here is a couple of guys in particular, but there are certain things, as Chuck was suggesting,

19:09.387 --> 19:18.119
in the form of that, one having to do with just the use of language, you can see over the 12-week period, there's a change in the use of language.

19:18.139 --> 19:20.642
They usually begin to feel more comfortable with it.

19:21.283 --> 19:32.959
And the way they pace themselves, the first night they're often talking over each other, but then they get that sense of, you know, when to pause, when you get somebody else in.

19:33.479 --> 19:37.825
The other really remarkable thing I've seen in almost all the classes is

19:38.345 --> 20:06.428
The first few weeks that come in, you can almost always, they're standing on the car, waiting, or out early in the year, if it's warm, it's the outside, and a lot of other students will be coming in for the evening courses, and you can almost always pick out who's going to be in the changing lives, because they look different, they stand differently, they tend to dress differently, but by the, you're into this half, you know, six weeks or so, and suddenly, if you didn't know,

20:07.100 --> 20:11.505
You know, this kind of unconscious sense of assimilation.

20:11.525 --> 20:13.247
And it's not just the clothing.

20:13.267 --> 20:15.729
It's the way they look, the way they're standing.

20:15.810 --> 20:18.693
There's just a different sensibility operating there.

20:18.793 --> 20:21.836
And have all of these kids actually spent some time behind bars?

20:22.257 --> 20:23.538
Every one of them.

20:23.558 --> 20:24.459
Every one of them.

20:25.180 --> 20:26.421
He said he did two months.

20:26.441 --> 20:27.402
He was very lucky.

20:27.422 --> 20:30.846
Could have been a lot longer than that.

20:31.265 --> 20:38.400
I snatched him from the jaws of... And what was Kyle's offense?

20:38.561 --> 20:48.582
Well, depending on who you believe, he either had a lot of rings on or brass knuckles, and depending on who you believe, there was also a knife involved.

20:48.730 --> 20:49.551
Well, there wasn't.

20:49.571 --> 20:50.954
So there's some assault issues.

20:50.994 --> 20:53.177
Looking like a true lawyer.

20:53.598 --> 20:57.344
So it was alleged that there might have been some assault issues involved, right?

20:57.504 --> 20:58.986
Assault and battery are the dangerous ones.

20:59.006 --> 21:01.951
Yeah, I'm just trying to figure, just for myself, figure out.

21:02.091 --> 21:05.336
Juvenile record, gang issues, you saw the paint.

21:05.617 --> 21:08.301
Yeah, I was like, what is that picture by then?

21:08.321 --> 21:09.202
I was trying to figure it out.

21:09.222 --> 21:09.803
I think it's him.

21:10.504 --> 21:11.386
It's him.

21:11.406 --> 21:11.927
Is that really?

21:13.309 --> 21:16.594
See the things you're trying to figure out when you're sitting here, getting a...

21:16.793 --> 21:22.400
They may not have gone to jail before, but in the case at hand, they're usually facing jail.

21:22.881 --> 21:24.603
And serious jail, right?

21:24.623 --> 21:25.744
We're talking jail now.

21:25.764 --> 21:27.566
Well, we're talking jail, not prison.

21:27.646 --> 21:30.350
So three months, six months, a year, perhaps?

21:30.710 --> 21:40.002
It's serious, though, in our system, because if they end up in Ash Street, you're looking at a 200-year-old facility designed for 150 members.

21:40.102 --> 21:41.043
I don't think how many.

21:41.083 --> 21:44.387
The local sheriff is a refugee from...

21:44.637 --> 21:45.358
The Stone Age.

21:45.378 --> 21:46.419
I mean, North Carolina.

21:47.701 --> 21:49.383
Oh, that explains it.

21:49.403 --> 21:56.271
He believes, Monco Sheriff is an interesting guy who has argued that it's a good thing to put these guys in chains.

21:56.291 --> 22:04.201
And he's actually had chain gangs out on the street here, which people have obviously... Massachusetts, huh?

22:04.321 --> 22:11.410
You got a chain gang, you got, if you need something painted, like a church or whatever, or somebody's house, they'll paint it for you.

22:11.430 --> 22:11.890
In chains?

22:12.151 --> 22:12.591
In chains.

22:13.132 --> 22:13.292
Wow.

22:13.312 --> 22:14.053
In gangs, yeah.

22:14.168 --> 22:16.192
I didn't think we had that in Massachusetts.

22:16.212 --> 22:17.755
Yeah, it's very spiritually uplifting.

22:17.815 --> 22:19.578
All you have to do is listen to the sheriff.

22:19.839 --> 22:26.291
My daughter went to college in Virginia, and we'd be driving down there, and there'd be bus out there.

22:26.452 --> 22:33.004
Department of Corrections, you'd see two guys out there with rifles, and these guys chained out there cleaning

22:33.423 --> 22:49.343
There were concerns early in the program about bringing convicted criminals onto a university.

22:49.383 --> 22:52.648
Did that raise safety concerns?

22:52.668 --> 22:56.112
And there have been some tense moments.

22:56.172 --> 22:59.937
There was that class when two gang members from opposite gangs invested

23:00.980 --> 23:05.226
considering either killing themselves here or taking it outside.

23:05.246 --> 23:10.194
And didn't they shake hands and agree to get through the class?

23:10.414 --> 23:14.160
Please, don't have no blood on the table here.

23:14.220 --> 23:16.063
And they did get through the class, as I recall.

23:16.603 --> 23:17.605
Actually, it worked out fine.

23:18.246 --> 23:20.890
They said they didn't know each other at all.

23:20.910 --> 23:22.592
They didn't know each other's names.

23:22.613 --> 23:25.277
That's the beauty of it, though, is that they don't.

23:25.857 --> 23:28.181
And that frees them, really.

23:28.541 --> 23:29.603
And do you pointedly not...

23:29.988 --> 23:31.390
Do you call them by name?

23:31.410 --> 23:32.030
Yeah, I do.

23:32.070 --> 23:35.634
Yeah, I mean, that's my... I do do that consciously.

23:35.754 --> 23:41.080
I've found that for whatever reason, it just seems to be... A little bit of anonymity, you think, is productive.

23:41.160 --> 23:56.957
Well, yeah, because I hadn't thought about this when we started the program, but over the first couple of years, one thing I did realize, and it's probably obvious now, I didn't think about it, was that whenever we were talking about a character, a book, at some other level,

23:57.646 --> 24:04.197
people were talking about themselves, you know, because they were seeing through the character their own experience, their own life.

24:04.798 --> 24:06.320
Little like what this guy was saying.

24:06.441 --> 24:08.504
I think we pretend to map our story on others.

24:09.345 --> 24:11.209
And so that gave them some level of protection.

24:11.249 --> 24:12.150
It was very different.

24:12.190 --> 24:16.097
Most women experienced some kind of therapy groups.

24:17.098 --> 24:19.522
And this is clearly not a therapy group.

24:19.542 --> 24:23.569
And I think part of the benefit and the power of it is that they are protected at that level

24:24.258 --> 24:28.162
You're always talking through the character, even though you're in some other level talking about yourself.

24:28.222 --> 24:35.230
And you're looking at all these dimensions of people seeing you as well as you examining yourself as you go through the story.

24:35.891 --> 24:42.078
And in the same context, I thought, at least, about it in terms of names and other things.

24:42.098 --> 24:45.261
I was saying, well, they'll feel good about being in the room.

24:45.301 --> 24:47.964
They come together as a community a little bit at that level.

24:48.145 --> 24:50.367
Clearly, they're willing to argue for each other.

24:50.650 --> 24:57.822
But it's probably just as well that they don't have that kind of personal friendship because it does give them one more defense.

24:58.624 --> 25:13.790
They can continue to feel open and talk and say things and not be worried that they're exposing themselves too much because they have a little bit of that anonymity and they also have the protection of the story itself as they talk through the character.

25:13.910 --> 25:15.713
It's like the person you meet on the airplane.

25:16.655 --> 25:22.361
And then you suddenly find yourself divulging things that you'd never say to anybody that you knew.

25:22.441 --> 25:25.264
And then it is two ships passing in the night.

25:25.364 --> 25:27.927
Oh, it's more intense than that.

25:27.987 --> 25:29.869
I'd call it academic respect.

25:29.889 --> 25:37.356
When a person speaks, he's presenting words that can be attacked by others around the table, but one is not attacked personally.

25:38.357 --> 25:40.119
You don't have to lay yourself on the table.

25:41.120 --> 25:42.882
And you can put up trial balloons that

25:43.283 --> 25:47.089
Is there an arc to the stories?

25:47.109 --> 25:51.175
Do you really work very hard about the order of how you're presenting them?

25:51.335 --> 25:55.121
Well, there are clearly connections among the stories.

25:55.141 --> 25:56.763
Which were pretty evident, were even brought out.

25:57.024 --> 26:00.249
Yeah, it's pretty obvious.

26:00.269 --> 26:10.124
So thematically, they grow, and one story makes the map itself on another story as well as individual matters.

26:10.144 --> 26:12.447
But the other thing that I do try to

26:12.848 --> 26:25.847
to accomplish, although last night is, again, a little different, is, in terms of an arc, is trying to start with stories that are going to be a little easier and shorter and easier in terms of language.

26:25.887 --> 26:28.231
So something like Greasy Lake, which is an interesting story.

26:28.251 --> 26:36.583
It's kind of short, and they get into it, and it's not, it's got some interesting language, but it's not extraordinarily difficult.

26:36.603 --> 26:42.552
And then we'll go to Asanae of Mice and Man, which is also not too tough for the whole man to see, and then slowly move to

26:43.325 --> 26:46.209
The longer work, anyway, like deliverance.

26:46.229 --> 26:48.972
Well, and they had two weeks to do deliverance.

26:49.173 --> 26:50.775
That was a pretty good assignment there.

26:51.215 --> 26:52.437
It is, for them, especially.

26:52.457 --> 26:53.919
That's what saved the bacon.

26:54.680 --> 26:58.124
Yeah, that was Wayne's out, because, you know, what did you do?

26:58.144 --> 27:01.849
We have 40 pages, and we just did this 325-page book.

27:03.291 --> 27:05.674
You should forget that you heard that, by the way.

27:05.934 --> 27:08.277
Yeah, that's one that you shouldn't.

27:08.377 --> 27:11.982
That one should never find its way into Frank, that Wayne cut him any slack.

27:12.653 --> 27:16.578
Certainly the challenges and the insurmountable problems that the book's raised.

27:16.658 --> 27:18.380
I say the obvious.

27:18.420 --> 27:21.284
The way this thing is coming together, it's not a blow-by-blow.

27:21.444 --> 27:21.684
Good.

27:22.926 --> 27:24.227
I think it's pretty well stated.

27:25.048 --> 27:32.618
The quote is, it's the only time in my life I've ever seen a situation where if you don't read the book, you'd stand a very real possibility of going to jail.

27:33.519 --> 27:38.024
That's a hell of a lot better than, you know, his... But he had to do it.

27:38.044 --> 27:38.765
That was essential.

27:38.785 --> 27:39.566
That had to be done.

27:39.606 --> 27:40.087
Oh, no.

27:40.427 --> 27:40.888
I did it.

27:41.206 --> 27:45.251
especially with me here, it had to be, because it was pretty obvious to me that he had two slackers here.

27:45.752 --> 27:50.197
And I was saying to myself, well, how the hell are they going to get away with that?

27:50.538 --> 27:52.140
Well, he does do that.

27:52.180 --> 27:57.987
There's a little bit of a good cough, bad cough routine here, too, because I found it to be very helpful.

27:58.348 --> 28:00.410
As a probation officer, he's the guy.

28:00.450 --> 28:00.971
He has to be.

28:00.991 --> 28:02.833
You've got to do that kind of thing.

28:02.853 --> 28:06.037
And in my role, I don't have to do that.

28:06.218 --> 28:08.040
In a way, I count on him to do that.

28:08.320 --> 28:09.762
So I remain the guy who's going to

28:10.872 --> 28:16.599
talk about the literature with these guys and sort of get into that part of it, but I don't have to.

28:16.619 --> 28:18.061
The enforcement is Wayne's job, isn't it?

28:18.121 --> 28:19.562
And that's why he's here.

28:19.602 --> 28:20.904
He's here for the session?

28:21.024 --> 28:21.144
It is.

28:21.325 --> 28:22.566
Oh, yeah.

28:22.586 --> 28:27.412
It's not the only reason why he's here, but he does represent that.

28:27.432 --> 28:38.365
But is it a requirement of the program that... It's not required that any probation officer be here, but generally, the best situation, we're going to have a...

28:38.783 --> 28:42.568
professor, a probation officer, and a judge.

28:42.588 --> 28:45.672
We have a judge here tonight, but there wasn't.

28:45.692 --> 28:52.021
In this cycle, for various reasons, we've only had one time a judge here.

28:52.421 --> 29:00.532
When we started the program, we did have a judge who was part of the group that came and started the program.

29:00.552 --> 29:02.295
It was very interesting, because now you've got that up.

29:02.315 --> 29:04.998
That's another important voice at the table as well.

29:05.980 --> 29:07.862
And he sort of plays the

29:08.062 --> 29:25.268
very interesting role, because as a judge, these guys are ordinarily looking at him, or any judge, as the, you know, you talk about stereotypes, the, you know, the authoritative figure in Doc Roe, who the Senate's made to jail, or, you know, that's their view of it.

29:25.288 --> 29:32.078
But slowly, over the course of the weeks, the discussion, it's as if, especially at the best moments, all these

29:33.475 --> 29:45.518
All the roles and all the stereotypes, you know, begin to drop, and what you have are just human voices exchanging ideas and perspectives, and suddenly the judge is not the judge.

29:45.658 --> 29:47.883
He's another human being with a very interesting point of view.

29:48.343 --> 29:51.309
And the judge also hears the criminal offenders.

29:51.730 --> 29:53.413
You know, this guy is no longer the criminal offender.

29:53.433 --> 29:56.479
He's got some really interesting ideas.

29:56.932 --> 30:06.664
At the very best moment, and I think, again, this is part of the power of literature, you've got a situation where everyone around the table has, in a sense, dropped all the masks.

30:06.724 --> 30:26.888
What you have is suddenly a human voice in various manifestations, people listening to each other, people articulating ideas, and you have, at its essence, the human community come together feeling the rhythm of the human heart.

30:27.087 --> 30:31.071
I'm absolutely sure that's what happened at the best moment.

30:31.091 --> 30:32.312
And it comes out of literature.

30:33.113 --> 30:34.995
I think literature is responsible.

30:35.576 --> 30:42.183
You know, you just know that it can happen and it does happen.

30:42.203 --> 30:45.526
It doesn't happen every moment, it doesn't happen every session, but it happens.

30:45.806 --> 30:50.351
And when it does, in my view, it's really because of the literature.

30:50.371 --> 30:52.133
Is it pretty much the same reading list?

30:53.159 --> 30:55.302
We get bored and change it.

30:55.363 --> 30:56.484
Yeah, we change it.

30:56.905 --> 30:58.468
But it's usually something like that.

30:59.629 --> 31:03.856
You know, we're going to use Sea Wolf, you know, by Jacqueline.

31:03.876 --> 31:07.382
We didn't use that for various reasons, but that's one that we sometimes use.

31:07.462 --> 31:11.609
We use some Raymond Carver stories sometimes.

31:11.669 --> 31:13.972
Bob Clever-Coles uses Carver and everything.

31:14.253 --> 31:14.353
Yeah.

31:14.493 --> 31:15.214
James Agee.

31:15.235 --> 31:18.660
Yeah, there are a lot of

31:18.910 --> 31:25.438
Yeah, a lot of good lines, good stories.

31:25.619 --> 31:31.767
Anyone that you've seen over the course of having taught this, how many times do you think, offhand, over the years?

31:32.768 --> 31:34.810
Probably twenty, twenty-five.

31:34.911 --> 31:37.975
You know, it's been about close to fourteen years now.

31:37.995 --> 31:40.318
We do at least two years or so.

31:40.338 --> 31:41.339
Close to thirty.

31:41.459 --> 31:45.024
Any works that are perennial favorites?

31:45.364 --> 31:46.926
I think the old man is indispensable.

31:47.615 --> 31:51.319
Oh, man, he is certainly one of the favorites.

31:51.339 --> 31:53.561
Because of the character, because of Santiago.

31:54.882 --> 32:01.488
Especially, again, I think it was a good point we got onto about the reading and then the discussion of reading.

32:01.869 --> 32:06.013
Because people read it, and they love, you know, there's something interesting about Santiago.

32:06.654 --> 32:16.423
But when we start talking about this guy, he really comes alive, and people understand the heroic nature of his endurance, you know, in the sense that

32:16.825 --> 32:26.434
And here's a guy who's been getting up for almost three months, going out every morning, hasn't caught anything, but yet he's willing to go out and try again.

32:26.815 --> 32:27.616
That's the beginning.

32:28.556 --> 32:32.480
How many people will, after a week or two, sort of give up?

32:32.500 --> 32:35.723
You hear the alarm clock, and then you go back into bed.

32:35.743 --> 32:45.533
So that sense of the heroism and the sense, you know, the endurance and the pain that the guy's going through, and

32:46.542 --> 32:51.087
And the fact that he's willing to do that really becomes increasingly attractive to think about it entirely.

32:51.787 --> 32:55.712
And one of my favorite stories in the course is related to that.

32:55.732 --> 32:58.254
And I think it really helps to define what happens in the course.

32:58.935 --> 33:05.462
This guy comes in one night after we had talked about, oh, man, this thing.

33:05.682 --> 33:07.464
And I don't know if I've told you this story before.

33:07.524 --> 33:12.869
He said, look, before we get started, I've just got to tell you this one thing that happened to me.

33:13.390 --> 33:16.313
Many of you probably know, but I don't know.

33:16.951 --> 33:18.713
drug addict for a very long time.

33:19.414 --> 33:20.936
I've been battling it.

33:20.956 --> 33:24.941
I've been clean for six months or a year.

33:24.961 --> 33:27.144
But I've really been feeling depressed lately.

33:27.164 --> 33:39.720
I was walking down the main street of New Testament last week, and this was after my phone, and he said, I came to Connor, a crucial Connor, and I paused.

33:39.740 --> 33:42.283
I was just feeling overwhelmingly depressed, and I knew

33:42.871 --> 33:45.875
that I ought to have to do is sort of make a turn to the right.

33:45.895 --> 33:50.822
It's as if I heard the siren, you know, the call from my old neighborhood.

33:51.603 --> 33:53.145
And I was drawn to it.

33:53.505 --> 33:55.448
And I just, I could hear that voice.

33:55.568 --> 33:59.453
And at that corner, I was just about ready to turn.

33:59.974 --> 34:01.676
Then I heard this other voice, he said.

34:02.758 --> 34:05.021
I think it was talking metaphorically at that moment.

34:05.221 --> 34:05.742
I hope.

34:05.762 --> 34:07.825
And he said it was the voice of Sandia.

34:07.845 --> 34:11.730
And he said what I, you know, I heard, it was like, he was, what he was,

34:12.335 --> 34:18.662
You know, he's calling to me, and I started thinking about Santiago, and I kept saying to myself, well, you know, I know what he went through.

34:18.902 --> 34:20.264
I know what he thought.

34:20.744 --> 34:22.566
And he looked at me.

34:22.647 --> 34:23.508
I remember the guy telling me.

34:23.528 --> 34:24.969
I said, you know, Professor West, I can't tell.

34:25.009 --> 34:25.610
It's going to happen.

34:25.690 --> 34:27.953
You know, two weeks from now, it'll still happen.

34:27.973 --> 34:35.541
But he said, it was that moment that I started thinking, if Santiago could do that, at least one more day, I could walk straight down...

34:35.808 --> 34:38.231
road here and not make that track.

34:38.331 --> 34:41.395
So essentially Santiago saved a guy's life.

34:42.296 --> 34:42.736
Literature.

34:43.617 --> 34:45.159
Literature saved his life.

34:45.179 --> 34:49.244
And that character, Santiago, is embedded in that guy's heart.

34:49.284 --> 34:50.285
I know it.

34:50.305 --> 34:51.086
That's the connection.

34:51.126 --> 34:52.668
And how recently did this happen?

34:53.509 --> 34:54.911
A couple years ago.

34:55.311 --> 35:00.578
Just remarkable, because it, to me, brought so many things about the program together.

35:00.598 --> 35:05.123
You know, I began to think, this is part of what happens at the best moments.

35:05.693 --> 35:06.494
around the table.

35:07.135 --> 35:08.938
And that's how literature can save life.

35:09.600 --> 35:10.120
And it does.

35:10.341 --> 35:11.543
And it changes guy's life.

35:11.563 --> 35:12.645
It saved his life.

35:12.665 --> 35:13.867
Salvation is there.

35:13.887 --> 35:28.992
The anecdote that Mike Leahy, the probation officer over in Florida, told me about, he, his supervisor came down unexpectedly from Boston one day and said, you know, I'm going with you today.

35:29.213 --> 35:31.296
And this guy who had been through the programs

35:31.580 --> 35:33.162
was on his list of people to see.

35:33.182 --> 35:34.844
So they went to the guy's house.

35:34.864 --> 35:36.186
That was the last call of the day.

35:37.427 --> 35:39.289
And it's a third floor walk up in Florida.

35:39.750 --> 35:42.373
The guy did his thing.

35:42.433 --> 35:43.294
They're all set to leave.

35:43.314 --> 35:45.837
And the guy tugged on Mike's lead.

35:45.857 --> 35:48.160
He says, I want to show you something.

35:48.180 --> 35:52.165
They walk through the mess of his house, the third floor.

35:52.485 --> 35:53.507
They get to the back room.

35:53.667 --> 35:56.811
He opens up a door with all the books.

35:56.831 --> 35:58.553
The guy had bought at yard sale.

35:58.613 --> 36:00.355
He says, I've bred three quarters of them.

36:00.740 --> 36:02.783
and I'm going to read all of them before I'm through.

36:02.923 --> 36:06.128
And Mike said, and that was really good.

36:06.148 --> 36:16.563
He said, but the best part was I saw him after that, and his son was heading down the same path that the father was on.

36:16.583 --> 36:24.054
And when he saw his father turn, he started reading the books his father was reading, and they started talking about them.

36:24.094 --> 36:30.223
And he said, that to me is the quintessential story of changing lines through literature.

36:30.406 --> 36:36.434
I mean, there's a whole family, there's two generations impacted by one court.

36:39.438 --> 36:42.762
It's a story that's echoed in various ways all around.

36:42.802 --> 36:53.876
The human ties we've made, the people we've wanted to respect and like and admire at this table, go way beyond any statistic of recidivism ever created.

36:53.896 --> 36:58.202
It's a matter of trying to translate that to other people.

36:58.553 --> 36:59.875
And that's the problem.

37:00.055 --> 37:01.738
We're asking them to take a chance.

37:01.778 --> 37:05.083
We're asking them to risk their... Does it work?

37:05.203 --> 37:06.886
There's no guarantee with any individual.

37:06.966 --> 37:08.448
Oh, with anything.

37:08.468 --> 37:13.255
And the women have comparable kinds of stories, I'm sure.

37:13.395 --> 37:23.310
And the reading list there is formulated by... Well, it's a very... I think of it as a very grassroots operation, in any case.

37:23.330 --> 37:27.717
So wherever one of these springs up, you know,

37:27.967 --> 37:32.653
facilitate a professor on a campus in whatever district or locality.

37:33.515 --> 37:43.509
It's pretty, I try to give them what advice and what wisdom they might have, but in the end, it's their choice in terms of what books they want to use.

37:43.549 --> 37:47.835
Imagine they're going to be passionate about the books that they want to use.

37:47.895 --> 37:52.381
We have extensive reading lists so they can make those choices that even though they don't have to use.

37:53.302 --> 37:57.568
And the result is that each group really has

37:58.038 --> 38:04.587
different books based apart on the choices that the facilitator wants to make out of their own passion.

38:04.607 --> 38:09.833
And also, again, in terms of the group itself, if it's a women's group, they're going to obviously want to shape it around.

38:09.853 --> 38:10.114
Sure.

38:10.634 --> 38:14.820
If it's an ethnic minority, they'll often think a little, at least, about the mix.

38:15.200 --> 38:26.475
There's a seminar day once or twice a year at a conference center at Northeastern University, and academics and probation officers and judges from around the country will collect that.

38:27.215 --> 38:34.245
And my impression of these people is that they're all highly intellectual, and they're very independent.

38:34.265 --> 38:40.173
They all have their own proud take on how they go about this program.

38:40.613 --> 38:43.678
There is no set series of commands from above.

38:44.118 --> 38:55.534
This is the original table at which the program was created, and yet academics from a wide variety of situations and backgrounds have been able to take this idea

38:56.003 --> 38:58.245
and do something positive with it.

38:58.265 --> 38:59.967
Use it as a template.

38:59.987 --> 39:02.090
And isn't it astonishing that you have it in Texas?

39:02.830 --> 39:03.831
That's the most, to me.

39:04.953 --> 39:07.055
Right in the Bible, though.

39:07.075 --> 39:08.416
It is incredible.

39:08.436 --> 39:09.117
Yeah, it is.

39:09.137 --> 39:10.218
It really is.

39:10.258 --> 39:11.700
I told you that when we were talking before.

39:11.720 --> 39:13.302
Well, I saw it on your website.

39:13.362 --> 39:15.084
Right, look at this.

39:15.144 --> 39:18.707
I remember when those guys came up originally from Texas.

39:18.728 --> 39:20.509
They said, you know, they're interesting.

39:20.529 --> 39:21.911
They wanted to come up.

39:21.931 --> 39:23.833
I kept saying to them,

39:23.982 --> 39:27.645
So, you know, it's one thing to have this program going to Massachusetts for all time.

39:28.086 --> 39:29.888
I think we're going to make a point out of that.

39:29.928 --> 39:31.069
Yeah, because I can see it.

39:31.089 --> 39:34.652
If we can ever get the program going in Texas, that's a whole different world now.

39:34.672 --> 39:46.343
I can just see a lot of my critics saying, look at him, he's got this chapter, Reach Out and Read, Massachusetts Operation, this one, Massachusetts Operation, Eating Out Liberals, that's what he's exploring.

39:46.363 --> 39:50.967
Well, I've got an essay, I think it's up on the web somewhere, it's a short one.

39:51.248 --> 39:53.770
It's published also, it's kind of obvious people.

39:54.037 --> 39:58.884
They had a paragraph about just that kind of thing.

39:59.705 --> 40:04.492
I was trying to make the point that this does transcend politics.

40:04.512 --> 40:19.453
What we're really talking about here is, again, the power of literature, and it's very interesting that both people from the left, liberal wing, politically, and people from the right, often very, very conservative, have embraced this program.

40:20.395 --> 40:32.969
And I had a sentence at two a time about, you know, these Texas judges were willing, and in many cases have, actually, they take capital cases and send people to their death.

40:34.531 --> 40:38.856
And those are the same judges who are embracing this program.

40:39.136 --> 40:47.466
And they believe, and probably more deeply than some of the judges in Massachusetts who are involved with this, that somehow,

40:48.779 --> 40:52.945
Our story, our literature can affect some kind of salvation.

40:53.125 --> 40:54.467
I think that's the way they're thinking about this.

40:55.389 --> 41:03.040
But they, from the far right, embrace it just as well as the other people, you know, liberal side.

41:03.060 --> 41:07.607
I've always believed literature really does transcend the politics anyway.

41:07.627 --> 41:15.779
It's not about something, the universal quality of the literature and the complexity of it.

41:15.799 --> 41:17.622
Listen, guys, I'm going to head back to

41:18.158 --> 41:18.644
All right.

41:18.786 --> 41:19.171
Oh, good.

41:19.191 --> 41:20.527
Thank you.

41:20.548 --> 41:21.418
Glad to have you.
