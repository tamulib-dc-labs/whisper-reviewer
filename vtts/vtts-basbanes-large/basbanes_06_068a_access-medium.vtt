WEBVTT

00:03.220 --> 00:06.308
We're talking to Charles Knudsen.

00:06.669 --> 00:08.615
This is the Nigerian collection.

00:08.755 --> 00:16.977
These are papers that I collected even while the Nigerian war was going on from people I knew in Africa and other book theaters still love.

00:17.159 --> 00:20.843
Even when the Nigerians come to the collection, they're amazed and say, where do you get this material from?

00:20.883 --> 00:23.947
We don't have the various pamphlets from the little villages.

00:24.047 --> 00:25.008
So where do you get it from?

00:25.028 --> 00:29.453
Well, I got it from dealers, and people sent things to me during the war.

00:29.694 --> 00:31.155
We have more catalog here.

00:31.195 --> 00:33.638
But I mean, you have stuff that the Nigerian government doesn't have.

00:33.879 --> 00:35.581
On the war, because, right, yes.

00:36.181 --> 00:42.449
So this is one of the, on the AME, we have a large church collection on the black church.

00:43.129 --> 00:43.690
One of the,

00:44.176 --> 00:46.298
one of the most important collections around.

00:46.318 --> 00:49.301
I mean, uh-oh.

00:49.321 --> 00:50.562
Do you have a, uh, is this the first?

00:50.723 --> 00:52.044
This is the first binding, I know.

00:52.064 --> 00:55.107
No, this is, um, this is about the 1870s.

00:55.207 --> 00:55.547
Yeah.

00:55.567 --> 00:56.829
Do you have the first of us?

00:56.889 --> 00:59.031
No, no, I, I, it's for some reason.

00:59.511 --> 01:00.973
I didn't want to put the money out to buy.

01:00.993 --> 01:03.595
I mean, it's important, but, you know, one of the other things.

01:03.615 --> 01:04.536
I got it, you know.

01:04.556 --> 01:04.937
You do.

01:05.277 --> 01:05.998
This is the, um.

01:06.258 --> 01:07.419
I got a wonderful sculpture.

01:07.439 --> 01:08.020
No kidding.

01:08.540 --> 01:12.124
This is the, um, I forgot what edition this is.

01:12.897 --> 01:16.501
Well, actually, it doesn't matter.

01:16.581 --> 01:18.524
It's been rebounded.

01:18.544 --> 01:19.485
It's the textbook.

01:19.505 --> 01:20.766
Yeah, this is the textbook.

01:20.786 --> 01:24.451
I mean, it's important, but I could have had it.

01:25.111 --> 01:26.934
But there's so many other things I wanted, you know.

01:28.475 --> 01:29.417
That's a lot of money for that.

01:30.218 --> 01:39.489
Yeah, because, you know, I can buy books, for instance, something on the Harlem Renaissance period, or books on something like the Caribbean.

01:39.509 --> 01:42.432
You know, there's certain books, libraries,

01:42.817 --> 01:45.441
Every library should have Uncle Tom Cabin.

01:45.521 --> 01:51.311
I have copies published in Pennsylvania Dutch, you know, which I'll show you.

01:51.652 --> 01:53.114
And I have some other obscured copies.

01:53.134 --> 01:59.685
But there's some of the key books, most of the key books that pertain to African American history and black history I have.

02:00.166 --> 02:02.850
So therefore I have all of the Harlem Renaissance writers.

02:03.067 --> 02:07.853
Right at work with Charles Chestnut and Dunbar, have all the Dunbar and things like that.

02:08.073 --> 02:10.837
That's the gentleman whose portrait you have in the reading room.

02:10.997 --> 02:11.738
Yes.

02:11.938 --> 02:14.561
What room was this, by the way, that we were just in?

02:14.581 --> 02:17.545
We call this our special collection room.

02:17.845 --> 02:18.466
Okay.

02:18.506 --> 02:20.008
The main collection, we're scattered all over.

02:20.028 --> 02:20.989
How many rooms do you have?

02:21.269 --> 02:22.951
About eight to nine.

02:23.092 --> 02:23.472
Wow.

02:23.933 --> 02:25.314
But we're scattered out.

02:25.334 --> 02:26.035
And I have some here.

02:26.416 --> 02:27.056
There are books.

02:27.076 --> 02:27.917
You saw some in the big room.

02:27.937 --> 02:29.519
Some of these were my key books.

02:29.539 --> 02:31.942
Remind me to show you the book that's down in the skin.

02:32.183 --> 02:32.483
Okay.

02:33.526 --> 02:58.363
I've been doing this since I was even when I had the material in my home.

02:58.463 --> 03:00.005
These are stars here again.

03:00.566 --> 03:01.407
These are letters.

03:02.078 --> 03:03.961
It goes back to 1963, 64.

03:04.422 --> 03:06.386
I save all my letters.

03:06.406 --> 03:07.347
All your correspondence.

03:07.387 --> 03:09.571
All my correspondence.

03:09.591 --> 03:11.354
This is your personal correspondence, yeah.

03:11.474 --> 03:19.248
From Alice Walker, from Gloria Steinem, you know, from all kinds of people from all over the world.

03:19.308 --> 03:21.712
You know, there's alphabetical.

03:21.732 --> 03:25.639
It is broken down to, you know, different...

03:26.142 --> 03:30.487
You see a letter from Paul Robeson Jr., and, you know, scholars, and it goes over.

03:31.908 --> 03:34.091
These are the letters I answered, you know.

03:34.771 --> 03:38.255
And that way, if people come in here, they will know.

03:39.236 --> 03:40.057
Here's some more of Robeson.

03:40.077 --> 03:44.022
Robeson was always my idol, and I was able to meet him, you know, while he was here and all.

03:44.222 --> 03:45.383
R-O-B-E-S-O-N.

03:45.623 --> 03:47.465
Paul Robeson, yeah.

03:47.946 --> 03:50.249
These are, we call this our periodical room.

03:50.789 --> 03:53.432
And evidently, as I said, we have small rooms in the back.

03:53.682 --> 03:55.745
But once we get this all together, you'll sell bigger.

03:55.765 --> 04:12.491
There's the Caribbean Journal, books and magazines from Africa, African literature, the praise on Afrikaans, the writings of blacks, the Francophones, blacks who went to Paris and they published this magazine, the praise on Afrikaans.

04:12.711 --> 04:15.135
We have the first issue of Jet Magazine.

04:15.395 --> 04:18.960
Did you realize when you were beginning, look at this, these are all Jet Magazine.

04:18.980 --> 04:19.882
We're looking at it.

04:20.483 --> 04:22.626
The first issue of it, which is quite rare now.

04:22.842 --> 04:24.085
So you have a full run?

04:24.105 --> 04:24.766
No.

04:24.786 --> 04:31.781
I have an important run of it, but some of the 50s, early 60s, I'm still getting it.

04:31.821 --> 04:32.403
This is the first issue.

04:32.423 --> 04:33.325
That's number one.

04:33.826 --> 04:35.369
It costs 15 cents now.

04:35.389 --> 04:35.610
Wow.

04:35.730 --> 04:36.752
A dollar and a quarter.

04:36.772 --> 04:41.362
I'm sure they don't call themselves the weekly Negro news magazine.

04:41.462 --> 04:42.825
No, no.

04:43.160 --> 04:45.784
I can't take too much of that.

04:45.884 --> 04:48.968
Hey, can you get over that?

04:48.988 --> 05:03.908
It's like, but it's, I always say to Jack and Heavenly because they always contain important history, you know.

05:03.928 --> 05:08.695
It's journalism, too, which is a mirror of what's going on.

05:09.164 --> 05:11.389
In an immediate sense.

05:11.569 --> 05:14.635
That's true, and that way you keep afloat with history.

05:14.916 --> 05:21.189
Now, I'm going to go on the other side of this thing.

05:21.209 --> 05:23.053
This is your office here?

05:23.193 --> 05:25.097
Yes, this is my office.

05:25.618 --> 05:30.548
And usually it's clean off because I have about 35 phone calls to make.

05:31.068 --> 05:34.571
We can, you know, let's do this like in about an hour, you know, if you want.

05:35.051 --> 05:37.193
Well, we'll take a little time.

05:37.273 --> 05:38.374
No, I'm not saying I came back.

05:38.394 --> 05:39.235
I had that book.

05:42.198 --> 05:42.878
This is a booster.

05:42.898 --> 05:44.940
Robeson signed to me for me.

05:44.960 --> 05:49.304
I was even one of the few people in the world to be able to see him while he lived here in the city of Philadelphia.

05:49.764 --> 05:54.128
And his sister, Mrs. Marion Foresight, permitted me to see Paul.

05:54.469 --> 05:55.489
And you see he signed it.

05:55.509 --> 05:56.370
I can see his signature.

05:56.390 --> 05:57.331
And I have other books.

05:57.351 --> 05:58.712
Well, it's inscribed, actually.

05:58.732 --> 05:59.573
Yes, to me.

05:59.873 --> 06:05.659
to Charles Blockson from Paul Robeson, Black American Film Festival, 1917 to 1972.

06:05.679 --> 06:08.162
I also have other books.

06:08.282 --> 06:16.271
I have his personal book here by his wife, which he wrote in 1931, Paul Robeson's Negro, signed by her.

06:16.531 --> 06:17.232
Isn't that something?

06:17.252 --> 06:21.977
It came from his personal collection after his son sold the collection to the Argosy bookstore.

06:22.498 --> 06:23.439
It's Marian Anderson.

06:23.459 --> 06:24.540
I'm just going to grab one of these, okay?

06:24.560 --> 06:25.421
Yeah, take a couple.

06:25.461 --> 06:29.425
There's a picture of myself involved, Marian, right over the corner.

06:29.607 --> 06:44.469
We had an exhibition and a concert for her in February, January, and I was able to go up to her home in Danbury, Connecticut, and here you see over there in the corner, she's talking to me.

06:44.930 --> 06:48.696
She was one of them, along with Robeson and Joe Lewis and Marian Anderson.

06:48.736 --> 06:51.800
They were the heroes of our day in the 1940s.

06:51.920 --> 06:56.948
I mean, they were the people that black, most Americans point out as role models.

06:57.181 --> 07:04.148
You can imagine how I felt in meeting my heroes of my childhood, Marian Anderson and Paul Robeson, you know.

07:04.629 --> 07:18.103
And as you know, I just put a record, a poster, I mean a marker, a historical state marker for Robeson in front of the house that he stayed in for 10 years in Philadelphia near the University of Pennsylvania.

07:18.543 --> 07:21.587
So it's like my life has gone full circles, you know.

07:21.667 --> 07:24.910
I'm able to give back

07:25.767 --> 07:32.158
to people, to children, and of all races, what these people had provided for me, you know, as a child.

07:32.198 --> 07:32.879
And where did you grow up?

07:33.260 --> 07:36.525
I grew up in Norristown, Pennsylvania, which is 18 miles from Philadelphia, you know.

07:36.966 --> 07:50.830
So, I mean, I would come down here when I wasn't driving on the train to the O'Leary's, O'Leary, it's like L-E-A-L-Y, we call it the O'Leary bookstore, and I used to get, purchase,

07:51.569 --> 07:53.131
books that people just discarded.

07:53.151 --> 07:54.072
When you were in high school?

07:54.092 --> 07:54.873
In junior high school.

07:55.053 --> 07:55.814
So you were collecting?

07:55.834 --> 07:56.395
Oh, yeah.

07:56.415 --> 08:01.481
I started out in grade school collecting when I was in the— That story is that—that's eight years old, right?

08:01.602 --> 08:03.484
Yeah, when I was teaching—yes, I didn't know what I was doing.

08:03.504 --> 08:05.446
I became a collector before I knew it.

08:05.887 --> 08:11.254
So I went to salvaging armies and goods and will stores and all, but, you know, I went there for another reason.

08:11.594 --> 08:13.196
Before I was the oldest of nine.

08:13.917 --> 08:17.982
I mean, at that time, we had about—a sister and brother, I guess it was about four of us.

08:18.400 --> 08:21.845
I mean, basically, you know, the oldest of mine had one brother who died in death.

08:21.885 --> 08:27.635
But nevertheless, we went there for a while for shoes, for clothes, for furniture.

08:27.975 --> 08:28.957
So much now.

08:29.037 --> 08:30.599
And so, of course, they had books there.

08:30.639 --> 08:34.245
At the time, when the teacher told me that, I just had an interest.

08:34.285 --> 08:37.290
Say for the record, for my typist and for what the teacher told you.

08:37.630 --> 08:40.154
You're eight years old and you're in school.

08:40.254 --> 08:41.416
Yeah, in school.

08:41.557 --> 08:42.518
And I asked the teacher...

08:42.920 --> 08:44.262
and an integrated school district.

08:44.322 --> 08:45.023
I never had.

08:45.043 --> 08:45.783
It was in Norristown.

08:45.844 --> 08:52.011
Norristown, Pennsylvania, the same town where Tom Lasorda came from and so forth.

08:52.211 --> 09:05.067
But nevertheless, growing up in an integrated town on my street, there were Greeks, not because you are Greek, there were Italians, there were Irish, there were Germans, there were Polish people.

09:05.447 --> 09:11.695
So we had a mixture of people at the time, and most of us was poor as far as wealth.

09:11.978 --> 09:25.170
But as far as love and friendship, you know, if one, Mrs. Nellican, the Irish family, her mother was ill, my mother would bring soup or something to them, and the Italian family.

09:25.190 --> 09:28.033
So we had this community, you know, the bond.

09:28.474 --> 09:39.264
And as I said, I never had a black teacher in my life, even at Penn State, due to the fact that the Norristown integration didn't start there as teachers until 1960.

09:39.584 --> 09:41.766
So I asked the teacher, did we have any heroes?

09:41.982 --> 09:43.584
Besides Booker T. Washington.

09:43.604 --> 09:45.006
Did the black people have any heroes?

09:45.026 --> 09:46.228
Yeah, they didn't black people.

09:46.248 --> 09:47.169
She said, no, Charles.

09:47.609 --> 09:50.533
Negroes were born to serve white people.

09:50.814 --> 09:52.736
Now, she was a victim of her environment, you know.

09:52.756 --> 09:54.619
I mean, although at the time... She said that.

09:54.679 --> 09:55.941
Did you say this in front of the class?

09:56.001 --> 09:56.922
Oh, yes.

09:56.942 --> 09:57.863
Because it was common.

09:58.644 --> 10:04.632
You know, I mean, we were taught, and she was taught, she was a victim of her environment, you know, that she was...

10:04.747 --> 10:06.689
I'm sorry.

10:06.969 --> 10:08.211
She's a teacher.

10:08.231 --> 10:09.372
She should have known better.

10:09.392 --> 10:10.593
But there are teachers today.

10:10.914 --> 10:13.056
That's why you have all this Afrocentricity.

10:13.276 --> 10:15.819
They're going back to the same stuff they had in 1960.

10:16.059 --> 10:17.120
History pieces.

10:17.221 --> 10:20.644
Remember in 1960, they had the black power movement, integrated schools and all.

10:20.925 --> 10:21.986
The thing became lax.

10:22.386 --> 10:23.568
Now Afrocentricity.

10:23.628 --> 10:25.570
And a lot of people believe... Afrocentricity.

10:25.610 --> 10:26.771
Yeah.

10:27.272 --> 10:29.634
Newsweek magazine is promoting that now.

10:29.654 --> 10:30.655
There's a big article there.

10:30.675 --> 10:33.218
What I'm saying is that although I knew

10:33.670 --> 11:00.893
from my childhood, sitting around the steps, listening to my mother, and my father, my grandfather, and others, and you know, and the people in the black barber shop, they talked, they spoke, they spoke of here, they spoke of Booker T. White, they spoke of Jack Johnson, they spoke of other people, but I was curious, I always loved books since I was a child, because I was reading the Gwen Grimm fairy tales, and later I, you know,

11:01.801 --> 11:07.411
It would be developed into Westerns, but I was always amazed that there weren't that many black people.

11:07.811 --> 11:25.321
But of course, we did know of Booker T. Washington, and later, when she told me that, the first book I found, by chance, Curiosity, was when I went to, there was an ex-copy, I mean, there was a copy of Booker T. Washington's famous book, Up From Slavery.

11:26.163 --> 11:27.505
Then I found...

11:27.788 --> 11:31.973
So tell me, what did you think when the woman said this to you?

11:32.013 --> 11:34.115
No, because I was like confused.

11:34.135 --> 11:35.617
I was confused.

11:35.637 --> 11:56.800
You know, I was confused because I know, I knew that, listen to the old folks talk about, you know, Matthew Henson, or Jack Johnson, or Joe Lewis, and Mary Anderson, Roland Hayes, Paul Robeson, and other people, and later I discovered Langston Hughes, you know, and, but at the time,

11:57.455 --> 12:05.263
We were brainwashed through Hollywood also, because we never showed any black cowboys in those days.

12:05.283 --> 12:09.907
Now we know there are books by Bill Pickett, you know, in the other room, and they love.

12:09.927 --> 12:11.389
I have these books of cowboys.

12:11.409 --> 12:22.720
But at the time, Hollywood, you were programmed, I mean, Wedding Market was programmed, and we were programmed due to the fact we showed Eddie McDaniel as the black mammies and going with the wind.

12:22.885 --> 12:26.813
So as this teacher later found, she was a good woman.

12:27.013 --> 12:28.696
She was a precious person.

12:28.977 --> 12:32.263
A lot of people feel like she was a teacher.

12:32.904 --> 12:34.407
So there's other teachers.

12:34.828 --> 12:36.732
What a thing to say to a child, though.

12:36.752 --> 12:39.898
I'm sorry, I've got an eight-year-old guy right here.

12:40.351 --> 12:43.035
The times, you think they're more progressive.

12:43.055 --> 12:49.503
You have television, you have the Don Cosby family, a new Bill for a long while when he was here at the... I'd like to hear a quote from Bill about you.

12:49.523 --> 12:50.445
Do you think that's possible?

12:51.005 --> 12:51.866
I don't know.

12:51.947 --> 12:56.813
If he can get to it and see, it's hard to... Does he know what's happening with the collection?

12:56.853 --> 12:58.415
Yeah, he knows.

12:59.016 --> 13:00.758
Just a letter, you know what I mean?

13:00.778 --> 13:01.419
Yeah, maybe.

13:01.499 --> 13:04.584
I don't know exactly how... I'm talking about a formal interview.

13:04.604 --> 13:05.605
I think you could give me a quote.

13:05.745 --> 13:07.868
I certainly would like one from the president of the university.

13:07.968 --> 13:08.989
Yeah, well, Peter could give you one.

13:09.029 --> 13:09.430
Yeah.

13:09.781 --> 13:13.125
Maybe that's probably the more appropriate.

13:13.145 --> 13:18.070
Peter would know the bill's private number, too.

13:18.431 --> 13:20.293
Peter would give you one.

13:20.533 --> 13:24.217
Anyhow, I was talking about the teacher.

13:25.118 --> 13:26.740
Later, she told me.

13:26.760 --> 13:28.422
You gave me what, by the way?

13:28.442 --> 13:30.844
You said you gave me what, and I interrupted you?

13:30.864 --> 13:36.270
You mailed me a magazine article.

13:36.411 --> 13:37.712
Yeah, this one here.

13:38.097 --> 13:38.618
I got that.

13:38.758 --> 13:39.078
Okay.

13:39.118 --> 13:39.859
Yeah.

13:40.300 --> 13:41.261
We'll sit down a minute.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.203
Let's see what's going on.

13:42.683 --> 13:43.184
Okay.

13:43.204 --> 13:44.406
You got my newsletter there, didn't you?

13:44.426 --> 13:45.086
Yeah.

13:45.187 --> 13:47.109
Just grab one of the... Yeah, I got that and I got this.

13:47.750 --> 13:47.950
Okay.

13:47.990 --> 13:48.531
I got everything.

13:48.551 --> 13:53.678
These are... These are... Let me just... Let me show you this, please.

13:55.260 --> 13:56.722
Look at all the messages on your desk.

13:56.762 --> 13:57.043
Go ahead.

13:57.643 --> 13:58.805
Well, this is nothing up here.

14:00.047 --> 14:01.308
You have to be half of his guard.

14:01.328 --> 14:02.310
Now, where are you going today?

14:02.470 --> 14:03.651
Where's this next trip to?

14:03.712 --> 14:06.315
I was supposed to go to West Virginia, so we're going to have a meeting...

14:06.683 --> 14:10.148
with the superintendent, so that was postponed.

14:10.168 --> 14:13.212
I got back a little late from the plane from Brazil.

14:13.352 --> 14:16.336
Now, was Brazil a working trip?

14:16.717 --> 14:18.659
It was a vacation, which I only usually take.

14:18.679 --> 14:22.765
I mean, I only take about four, five, six days of my vacation of a month.

14:22.785 --> 14:23.706
But I went down there.

14:23.987 --> 14:30.436
It turned out, while I was down there, I went to some universities and met some historians and all.

14:30.456 --> 14:31.257
I put up a vacation.

14:31.277 --> 14:35.863
I went to Bahia, which is the African part of Brazil, located in Salvador.

14:36.248 --> 14:41.635
the B-A-H-I-A, the old B-A-H-I-A by E-S.

14:41.955 --> 14:54.752
It was the old capital of Brazil, and that's where they had the strongest African-Brazilian influence, because right across the Atlantic they were bringing the Africans from Benin, which is now Dahomey.

14:55.152 --> 14:58.697
But Dahomey, which is now Benin, was right across the river.

14:58.717 --> 15:01.481
They had more African-Americans than Brazil.

15:01.541 --> 15:04.905
People of African descent in Brazil, the United States,

15:05.257 --> 15:07.659
which shocked some people, but we have about 30 million.

15:08.120 --> 15:09.321
There they had 50 million.

15:09.781 --> 15:09.961
Wow.

15:10.042 --> 15:12.083
Did they know they were slaves?

15:12.103 --> 15:16.828
Oh, yeah, because they're right across the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa.

15:16.848 --> 15:17.869
They just took it right across.

15:17.889 --> 15:19.390
So it was a waste station, basically.

15:19.470 --> 15:20.972
Oh, it was a major waste station.

15:20.992 --> 15:21.092
Yeah.

15:21.392 --> 15:31.342
It was quicker to bring it from, say, the Guinea, the coast of Guinea, which is Nigeria, Dahomey, Senegal, right across to, you know, so it was easier than coming up.

15:31.822 --> 15:33.964
So this is why you have the strongest influence,

15:34.332 --> 15:45.809
I went to some Orisha's temple revisions, and I was able to make, because I have a lot of books on Brazil, but it felt like I was in Africa.

15:45.829 --> 15:47.011
I was in Africa before.

15:47.031 --> 15:58.748
It's like I went to the Caribbean and had the same spiritual, it was a highly spiritual trip, plus the fact on the day before I was leaving, I was walking, I had a few hours on my plane in Rio de Janeiro.

15:58.768 --> 16:01.993
I spent three nights in Rio de Janeiro and four dairies.

16:02.378 --> 16:06.964
I was walking, they had a lot of vendors there selling fruit from the fruit markets, black, white and all.

16:07.344 --> 16:09.067
And one guy is strange.

16:09.667 --> 16:10.629
I was walking down the street.

16:11.069 --> 16:13.512
They were selling bees, belts, and jewelry.

16:13.532 --> 16:14.494
Jewelry is very cheap.

16:14.514 --> 16:16.817
Gold is cheap down there and so forth.

16:16.937 --> 16:22.324
And this vendor had a color print, you know, of a S&Y guy.

16:22.344 --> 16:23.685
And I walked over to him.

16:24.186 --> 16:25.047
I said, well, how much is it?

16:25.067 --> 16:29.533
He spoke in Portuguese and a little bit of English and with my little Spanish.

16:29.699 --> 16:32.222
I said, how much he went for these?

16:32.242 --> 16:41.451
He said, well, all told, there was six of them, you know, for about, I think it was about, because there was, it was about $40.

16:41.891 --> 16:50.340
I mean, beautiful hand, well, I mean, prints, 1823, in historical prints, and it showed the history.

16:50.420 --> 16:51.081
It's this trip.

16:51.121 --> 16:51.641
It's this trip.

16:51.661 --> 16:52.082
It's this trip.

16:52.102 --> 16:53.423
Yeah, it showed the history of Bahia.

16:53.443 --> 16:54.504
It was during the slave period.

16:54.524 --> 16:55.625
How did people return?

16:55.706 --> 16:56.586
I couldn't believe it.

16:56.887 --> 16:57.808
So I bought them all.

16:57.848 --> 16:59.149
It was so cheap.

16:59.467 --> 17:01.250
The economy is very low then and now.

17:01.270 --> 17:04.795
I said, this is a godsend, my last day of Gordon's leaving.

17:04.815 --> 17:07.259
That's the serendipity of collecting, you know?

17:07.319 --> 17:10.283
I mean, we are strange.

17:10.503 --> 17:11.966
We are a special breed.

17:12.046 --> 17:13.248
That's what my book is about.

17:13.328 --> 17:14.109
Am I right?

17:14.389 --> 17:15.831
That's what the book is about.

17:15.851 --> 17:19.797
I said, it's like the agony in the escasee of, you know.

17:19.817 --> 17:24.985
Then I said, well, it's a natural flow for me as a collector from my last day.

17:25.032 --> 17:29.839
and to come across like they're just waiting for me in this thing.

17:29.939 --> 17:30.961
And this is wonderful.

17:30.981 --> 17:31.642
This is wonderful.

17:31.962 --> 17:34.486
Now, I'll get back to the story.

17:34.506 --> 17:39.654
I put my pen down when stuff comes out.

17:39.694 --> 17:41.637
I've been in too many readings.

17:41.877 --> 17:43.219
Yeah, I know.

17:44.161 --> 17:47.005
This is my junior high school.

17:47.786 --> 17:51.832
Now, your position, what was the name of the high school team you played for?

17:51.852 --> 17:53.354
I played for Norristown.

17:53.414 --> 17:54.516
Norristown High School.

17:54.901 --> 17:57.244
Running back?

17:57.444 --> 17:58.325
Yeah, running back.

17:58.365 --> 17:59.386
This is my junior high school.

17:59.707 --> 18:03.331
This is Stewart, S-T-E-W-A-R-T, Stewart Junior High School.

18:03.351 --> 18:05.073
We scored four touchdowns.

18:05.093 --> 18:06.215
We beat our arch rivals.

18:06.255 --> 18:09.158
This is the 50s now, 60s?

18:09.178 --> 18:15.306
This is the 40s, late 40s, late 40s.

18:15.606 --> 18:18.169
Late 40s from junior high school.

18:18.690 --> 18:22.555
So this is high school, early 50s here.

18:22.575 --> 18:23.676
How old are you now, might I ask?

18:23.909 --> 18:26.333
Oh, I'm 57.

18:26.353 --> 18:29.718
This is my high school hero, Kelly Fonville.

18:30.139 --> 18:35.687
He was the first black shot putter, world champion from Michigan, Charles Fonville, F-O-N-D-I-L-L.

18:36.869 --> 18:41.657
Later I met him at Penn State when we were out in Michigan for the Nationals.

18:41.697 --> 18:52.093
Marley Gray and myself were rivals in the shot putter, and we were out in Michigan for the Nationals in 1954, and he was one of the judges of the shot put.

18:52.377 --> 18:54.620
a competition with Charles Fonson.

18:54.680 --> 18:56.422
He's a dentist out there now.

18:56.582 --> 19:00.526
And I told him how much I admired him.

19:00.626 --> 19:13.121
So it was like I used to see him at the Penn Relays in junior high school and high school, and to go out there in 54 to see him was another conclusion or whatever.

19:13.141 --> 19:18.847
This is when I broke the... It was my mom.

19:19.548 --> 19:20.629
It helped me.

19:21.048 --> 19:23.511
I was a national champ, indoor AAU champ.

19:23.631 --> 19:24.832
You were a chef.

19:24.992 --> 19:26.294
Yeah, I was a state champ.

19:26.314 --> 19:39.448
I was held with Pennsylvania State Records in Pennsylvania, the Class A big school, and I was undefeated in the discus row in high school, you know, throughout high school.

19:39.988 --> 19:49.198
I was a state champ for three years in a row, and I held a state championship in the childhood for... Did you ever think of doing decathlon?

19:49.516 --> 19:58.566
One of these articles tells one of the local writers think that I should participate as a council on.

19:58.586 --> 20:01.610
But the only thing I couldn't do was broad, though.

20:01.650 --> 20:02.751
I could run on good speed.

20:02.771 --> 20:05.554
I ran 100, but I never trained for it.

20:05.574 --> 20:06.375
I ran 220.

20:06.395 --> 20:07.136
I ran a quarter.

20:07.697 --> 20:10.460
I ran the mile relay, 880, and so forth.

20:10.520 --> 20:18.409
We won the 10 relay for a senior year with Josh Cobra, who later went to the Olympics for the 400-meter hurdles.

20:18.794 --> 20:20.176
He held the world's record.

20:20.477 --> 20:21.318
He's on my team.

20:21.638 --> 20:26.606
And now Cam Tellos, who held the world's record for the jab and throw.

20:26.626 --> 20:27.307
He's from Norris.

20:27.367 --> 20:36.320
And we always had, Norris in our high school always had the best track teams, you know, because in the state, even from the time my father was an athlete.

20:36.380 --> 20:38.303
Here's Burt Bell, the commissioner.

20:38.323 --> 20:39.125
Oh, Burt Bell.

20:39.225 --> 20:40.206
NFL, right?

20:40.226 --> 20:40.747
Yeah.

20:40.867 --> 20:41.248
NFL?

20:41.388 --> 20:41.749
Yeah, yes.

20:42.029 --> 20:44.072
And Burt Adiego from Villanova.

20:44.573 --> 20:46.335
And what's his name?

20:46.416 --> 20:47.417
Raymond.

20:47.684 --> 21:03.696
Here in my high school coach, John Sweeney, I was the athlete of the, some of the area athlete of the week, and the Maxwell Football Club, honored as I received this award I still have there.

21:03.877 --> 21:09.388
And then as I said, I went on, these are some of these guys.

21:09.976 --> 21:11.879
This is our state championship track team.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.763
And what are the originals?

21:14.564 --> 21:16.047
These are Xerox.

21:16.227 --> 21:19.072
I have Xeroxed them all on acid-free papers.

21:19.092 --> 21:23.880
I still have the original book, but the original won't last as long as we, you know.

21:23.900 --> 21:27.727
So here's Josh Cobras who went on to make the Olympics.

21:27.747 --> 21:32.315
You know, this is when we were sitting ready with Lenny Moore's team.

21:32.475 --> 21:34.178
Lenny and I were rivals in high school.

21:34.411 --> 21:36.634
And we became roommates, I mean, with Penn State.

21:36.875 --> 21:40.460
We were, in the last half of the year, we were on the way to the state championship team.

21:41.281 --> 21:46.028
And this is where I, this is the first time I broke the state record.

21:46.068 --> 21:50.955
And then he went on to play great football with Baltimore Colts.

21:50.975 --> 21:51.496
Baltimore Colts.

21:51.516 --> 21:52.317
Yes.

21:52.337 --> 21:54.741
And I understand you had a shot with the Giants.

21:54.841 --> 21:56.303
Yes, yes.

21:56.663 --> 21:57.625
And you didn't do it.

21:57.645 --> 22:03.253
I didn't, I wanted, I had, I felt the, help me this time, I felt the,

22:04.955 --> 22:10.020
You know, I gave my body to sports since I was in grade school and all.

22:10.400 --> 22:12.082
And I wanted to keep my mind.

22:12.102 --> 22:17.367
I was drawn to the humanitarian side of education and all that.

22:17.387 --> 22:34.945
But, I mean, my dominary experience, people, some people could not apprehend or comprehend how, why I was an athlete and still loved poetry and books and music and chess and so forth.

22:35.043 --> 22:42.892
because they had a stereotypical, at that time, you know, and even today, just some people say, are you still the same Charlie Block?

22:42.912 --> 22:43.993
Are you still playing football?

22:44.013 --> 22:44.754
They still see me.

22:45.055 --> 22:48.479
Then they see me with my name here on the paper and television and all that.

22:49.219 --> 23:01.894
Some of them, you know, it's confusing to them, you know, but other people said it's a good example that I present for Kisinaw, you know, because I show the balance.

23:02.313 --> 23:04.296
Books have always been my first love.

23:04.316 --> 23:05.377
I mean, I always loved to read.

23:05.417 --> 23:14.669
I mean, I always had, not just practicing, but I read all the classics, I read all the fairy tales, and in the end, the odysseys, I mean, the great adventure stories.

23:14.689 --> 23:16.792
I mean, I always was fascinated in those.

23:16.812 --> 23:25.404
These are, this is, I went to Korea, this is a servant, but these are just, let me show you Rosie, Rosie Green.

23:25.764 --> 23:27.707
These are all, and here's Sonia Sanchez, who is here.

23:27.727 --> 23:30.210
Here's Charlie Fuller, who wrote a soldier story.

23:30.494 --> 23:35.459
These are the kids I talk to every year, the Jewish kids and the African-American kids.

23:35.960 --> 23:51.056
It's called Operation Understanding that Congressman Bill Gray, former Congressman Bill Gray from Philadelphia, and now the Negro, what you call, college, Negro, I can't take an accent, Negro College.

23:51.076 --> 23:52.878
I know what you're saying.

23:52.978 --> 23:54.199
United Negro College.

23:54.299 --> 23:54.740
Well, right.

23:55.260 --> 23:59.505
Bill has me, I mean, his group was black and Jewish.

23:59.823 --> 24:00.704
promote understanding.

24:01.825 --> 24:10.236
He sent them to Israel and sent them to Senegal, and they usually stop here at this collection, and I talk to them before they go over to the trip.

24:10.256 --> 24:11.517
So here's the group here.

24:12.298 --> 24:13.880
This is 86.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.242
Yeah.

24:15.262 --> 24:16.083
So this is current.

24:16.103 --> 24:16.363
Yeah.

24:16.864 --> 24:22.591
Well, then, this is... What I'm saying is that these scrapbooks are current.

24:22.651 --> 24:23.532
Oh, yeah, yeah.

24:23.552 --> 24:25.054
They're all up to date.

24:25.135 --> 24:26.277
This one here is the Danes.

24:26.297 --> 24:28.480
The Danish teachers used to come from Denmark every year.

24:28.920 --> 24:29.862
I'm talking to them here.

24:30.002 --> 24:33.246
What I'm saying is there's people here from all over the world.

24:33.847 --> 24:34.949
This is when I was in Sweden.

24:35.590 --> 24:37.873
I was talking to some children over in Sweden.

24:37.893 --> 24:38.233
Sweden.

24:38.273 --> 24:38.554
Yeah.

24:38.634 --> 24:43.220
This is all in Swedish.

24:43.921 --> 24:46.705
So tell me now, you were offered a

24:47.022 --> 24:49.626
You were invited by the Giants, uh, to come to camp.

24:49.646 --> 24:51.910
Is this what, uh, they drafted you?

24:52.191 --> 24:55.316
Well, you know, they asked me to come out to try out, but Winnisky Park went out.

24:55.336 --> 24:56.698
Yeah, I had a contract, you know.

24:56.718 --> 24:57.599
You had a contract?

24:57.619 --> 24:58.861
I mean, to sign, you know, the contract.

24:58.882 --> 25:00.224
They sent me, I still have the contract.

25:00.584 --> 25:01.386
It was $5,000.

25:01.406 --> 25:04.070
$5,000, you know, to try out.

25:04.531 --> 25:05.693
So you decided what?

25:05.713 --> 25:06.494
To do what instead?

25:06.514 --> 25:08.537
And then I decided I didn't want to do it, you know.

25:08.577 --> 25:10.000
So what did you want to do instead?

25:10.641 --> 25:13.165
I, I was, I just wanted to, um,

25:13.583 --> 25:13.963
I don't know.

25:13.983 --> 25:14.724
I went to the service.

25:14.824 --> 25:15.845
I went to the service.

25:15.865 --> 25:22.592
I knew that was coming up because they were like, you know, did you go to the service?

25:23.754 --> 25:26.296
From there, then I said, well, I'm going to get this out of the way.

25:26.336 --> 25:28.438
I didn't want to play sports football anymore.

25:28.719 --> 25:31.602
So I went to Fort Dix where I played football.

25:31.862 --> 25:33.844
The team, we had an 8-2 record.

25:34.305 --> 25:39.530
And when I went over to Korea, Rosie came in from the Giants of Follinger and played for them.

25:39.690 --> 25:42.573
And then, you know, I didn't want to play anymore.

25:42.593 --> 25:43.354
You know, I was just like,

25:43.553 --> 25:47.818
But did you realize that you would be a collector at this point?

25:47.838 --> 25:48.880
I always knew I was a collector.

25:49.260 --> 25:50.762
I was a collector before I knew it.

25:50.962 --> 25:55.107
But I mean that you would actually be building something, or were you planning to teach?

25:55.328 --> 26:07.603
What I'm trying to figure is— No, no, I was planning—I wanted to be—well, I wanted to be, at first, going back to the early period of my life,

26:08.056 --> 26:11.179
So Nick sort of bear with me because I'm still in this jet lag.

26:11.199 --> 26:12.440
I have my mind in Brazil.

26:12.460 --> 26:15.003
You don't mind if I get you on the track every Wednesday?

26:15.023 --> 26:15.924
No, no, no, no.

26:15.984 --> 26:22.130
But it had come together after a while because my mind is as sharp as it should be.

26:22.170 --> 26:37.506
What I'm saying is that early part of my days, I always wanted to be, when I was young to my earliest part of my life, I was in grade school, I wanted to be, I guess, three things.

26:37.756 --> 26:50.046
always, once I wanted to be a minister, I mean, I was like 7, 8th grade, maybe, that was high, but it was like, it wasn't pressing.

26:50.086 --> 26:53.930
Then I wanted to be an archaeologist.

26:54.790 --> 27:07.341
But then, history, history is, history has always played a dominant, I was always drawn to history, I was trying to look back to my high school

27:07.557 --> 27:16.626
yearbook where one of my classmates wrote a little sketch on me and he said that I was always interested in history, this child always, even in high school.

27:17.827 --> 27:35.385
As far as collecting, first I started collecting to satisfy, to prove that in my mind that I really didn't, that my subconscious mind, I didn't accept my teacher's comment as a challenge, not as something that I would hold against her.

27:35.866 --> 27:37.007
I'm a curious person.

27:37.561 --> 27:39.344
You know, being a collector, you have to be curious.

27:39.404 --> 27:48.859
I mean, curiosity and self-pride had a lot to do with that, because I knew, as I said, I heard the old folks sitting around.

27:48.879 --> 27:54.948
I always listened to old people, you know, old women talking around growing up and old men in the barbershop.

27:55.489 --> 27:59.956
Their stories would always fascinate me about Jack Johnson and about slavery days and all that.

28:00.377 --> 28:04.463
So I knew that some, you know...

28:04.966 --> 28:14.116
In one sense, my mind said, we weren't supposed to be our schools, so we're all equal, that we weren't supposed to serve anyone, any group of people.

28:14.556 --> 28:19.882
But at the same time, I guess her remark was used as a stimuli.

28:20.022 --> 28:30.033
She stimulated me, my curiosity, to seek, to find, to search, to hunt, which I became saturated with as a collector.

28:30.093 --> 28:32.175
Not that it dominated my mind.

28:32.215 --> 28:33.977
Is the teacher still alive?

28:34.565 --> 28:39.372
Well, I met her years later, you know, I mean, she was like, she was... And there's nothing... Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:39.392 --> 28:42.456
There's nothing personal, there's nothing... No, she's dead, she's dead.

28:42.476 --> 28:46.201
But I mean, do you think she knew at some point what you had accomplished?

28:46.662 --> 28:55.274
No, she told me later, she told me, you know, she said, you know, Charles, you have taught us all something, you know, about ourselves and history.

28:55.554 --> 28:59.219
She said, I was raised this way, you know, this is what she heard from her parents.

28:59.239 --> 29:02.243
It was a nice little... It was a nice ending to the story.

29:02.263 --> 29:03.525
Yeah, it wasn't a...

29:03.742 --> 29:04.924
What's the word I'm going to use?

29:04.944 --> 29:06.086
The vindictive story.

29:06.126 --> 29:10.334
I mean, it was like I respected her because, you know, she took the time.

29:10.935 --> 29:18.068
She said, oh, Charles, black people were born to serve whites because this is what her books and all.

29:18.108 --> 29:21.955
And she later became upset the way she was taught, you know.

29:22.496 --> 29:23.838
She remembered making that comment.

29:23.898 --> 29:24.539
Of course she did.

29:24.619 --> 29:24.940
Yeah.

29:25.240 --> 29:26.742
It probably bothered her all those years.

29:26.802 --> 29:27.983
Yeah.

29:28.043 --> 29:31.527
Especially as word probably got back that Charles was putting together.

29:31.627 --> 29:32.287
She was a subject.

29:32.307 --> 29:33.108
Major collection.

29:33.208 --> 29:33.589
Yes, yes.

29:33.909 --> 29:35.210
She was a subject to teacher.

29:35.311 --> 29:36.612
Then she later got it.

29:36.632 --> 29:37.553
But she was a nice person.

29:37.573 --> 29:38.073
What grade were you in?

29:38.093 --> 29:38.634
Do you remember?

29:38.734 --> 29:40.136
Up in the fourth grade.

29:40.156 --> 29:41.377
Yeah, the fourth grade.

29:41.417 --> 29:41.637
Wow.

29:41.937 --> 29:45.541
So what kinds of stuff did you start bringing home from the Salvation Army thing?

29:45.561 --> 29:46.823
Do you have some of these?

29:47.383 --> 29:52.969
Well, see, I have the Booker T. Wash, and then I have, you know, I have one of the

29:53.438 --> 29:54.520
What else do I have?

29:54.880 --> 29:56.243
A couple of Langston Hughes things.

29:56.263 --> 29:58.907
I have about, oh, I have one in my mind.

29:58.927 --> 30:00.389
Here's I grew up in junior high school.

30:00.670 --> 30:03.555
Then I got into Black Boy by Richard Wright I have.

30:04.076 --> 30:11.247
I got into Chester Hines, the book, If He Hotter, Let Him Go, his first book.

30:11.748 --> 30:14.653
I have, what's the other book I have?

30:15.123 --> 30:19.430
something by Oscar Michaud, his books on... Can you spell that M-I-C-H-A-U-D, probably?

30:19.470 --> 30:23.236
Yeah, M-I-C-H... Oscar Michaud.

30:23.256 --> 30:25.700
I'll check it out.

30:25.901 --> 30:35.817
My mind is... Remind me when I get over... No problem.

30:36.097 --> 30:40.945
So I would say that this collection, as comprehensive as it is,

30:41.752 --> 30:45.516
I mean, this is not the kind of thing where you had a lot of money to spend, either.

30:45.536 --> 30:47.438
No, money, as I said before.

30:47.479 --> 30:54.226
I mean, you're not a man whose parents, as you already said, you're not from a millionaire's family.

30:54.246 --> 30:56.309
No, because my father worked on a steel mill.

30:56.329 --> 30:59.052
Later he started his own plastering, sorry, plaster.

30:59.372 --> 31:00.293
Well, that was in high school.

31:01.254 --> 31:08.923
He was the first black steel maker, the first helper for Allen Wood, A-L-L-A-N, Wood Steel Company.

31:09.140 --> 31:12.024
Cutcha Hawk in Pennsylvania, which is not too far from Norristown.

31:12.465 --> 31:16.231
So he became the first helper, the one to operate the oven.

31:16.711 --> 31:21.298
He had to fight his way for the position and all, but he was able to do it.

31:22.300 --> 31:24.423
What I'm trying to say is, you were a teacher?

31:25.064 --> 31:25.885
Did you ever teach?

31:26.305 --> 31:27.447
No, I taught.

31:28.609 --> 31:31.093
What did you do professionally prior to?

31:31.513 --> 31:35.740
Well, I went to the service, and I came out, and I started a janitorial business.

31:35.760 --> 31:36.561
You're a businessman.

31:36.581 --> 31:37.442
Yeah.

31:37.591 --> 31:44.200
On the side, I was at Norristown Irish High School as the administrator in human relations and cultural affairs.

31:44.460 --> 31:50.148
Invitory specialist in human relations and cultural affairs was my title, where I went to some of the schools.

31:50.168 --> 31:53.713
I talked about ethnic history in the schools.

31:53.793 --> 31:55.215
I interviewed teachers and principals.

31:55.355 --> 31:59.261
I helped with affirmative action, I mean, human relations and all that.

31:59.901 --> 32:03.987
But at the same time, I had a business on the side where

32:04.456 --> 32:12.147
Most of the money I used, you know, somewhat for livelihood, but most of it I used just to continue my collection, you know.

32:12.247 --> 32:12.527
Really?

32:12.547 --> 32:14.049
But it was a small.

32:14.690 --> 32:20.398
Right, but you were basically earning money to build, and you were using it to build the collection.

32:20.418 --> 32:34.277
Well, probably some of, I guess a small percentage of it, Nick, was, went to books and all, but the extra small business I had, I had about three guys working for me, but

32:34.848 --> 32:51.013
It provided me extra funds, you know, to continue my collection, because that was during the time of the 1960s when black power and black pride was at its peak, although I had a large collection before the 60s came.

32:51.514 --> 33:03.572
And people used to wonder why I was collecting, you know, even from black people of African Americans, they would say, why, you know, not that many knew, because I was always sort of an introverted person, you know.

33:03.974 --> 33:04.935
I was always drawn.

33:04.955 --> 33:05.997
People were always drawn to me.

33:06.017 --> 33:07.258
I was always outstanding.

33:07.278 --> 33:15.929
In the school, people knew me, my talent and all, but they never knew my interest in books, per se, as far as collecting.

33:16.530 --> 33:19.894
Because as I said at the time, a lot of black people did not know.

33:20.455 --> 33:23.238
They were ashamed of their culture through ignorance.

33:23.399 --> 33:32.030
I have a saying that the hand that holds the pen, the quill, and the pencil controls history.

33:32.530 --> 33:33.171
In other words,

33:33.556 --> 33:44.811
The people who were in control during those times I was growing up did not present history, the proper history, of African-American or Negroes or colored people, as we were called in those days.

33:44.891 --> 33:54.844
So therefore, a lot of black people, African-Americans, were ashamed of the word black because the connotation meant black hand, black cat, everything evil.

33:55.205 --> 34:01.273
So this is why the students today are proud of wearing these T-shirts that are black pride or African-Americans.

34:01.413 --> 34:03.175
I was able to see...

34:03.965 --> 34:05.947
a turnaround from my childhood days.

34:06.068 --> 34:11.454
It's one of the kids I talk to when I travel around the country and people come here from all over the world and so forth.

34:12.475 --> 34:17.782
It's delightful for me to know that I was a conduit, you know.

34:17.822 --> 34:25.872
I mean, some of the awards I received, I had a special day in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.

34:26.138 --> 34:34.247
library, and the whole state gave me a special day, the key to the city, the key to the county, the key to my hometown, the governor, the legislature.

34:34.267 --> 34:34.888
I had all that.

34:35.349 --> 34:45.961
At the time, I never knew how far my books, you know, gave me, took me, I have two honorary degrees, and one's in Illinois, Lincoln University, the first black college.

34:46.021 --> 34:55.892
I never knew, and this book here, I have, I'll keep talking to you, there's people from all over the world who have been in here.

34:56.075 --> 34:58.417
You know, I keep writing.

34:58.718 --> 35:11.351
What I'm saying to you, all the time that I was preparing myself, unknowingly that I was becoming a biblophile, a black biblophile.

35:11.431 --> 35:13.112
As you can see, I saved everything.

35:13.553 --> 35:16.196
I even saved my Christmas card, you know.

35:16.356 --> 35:17.677
It's the collector.

35:17.757 --> 35:25.525
It's the collector, because like Langston Hughes, our great writer, he saved his laundry slips.

35:25.792 --> 35:41.527
And I read about other, from the article you read about, I Xerox for you, then after I was playing sports, I was able, through traveling in high school, not as much in high school, because I came to Philly in high school to collect the old bookstores.

35:41.927 --> 35:46.091
Books were, you could pick up books for a dime, black books, you know.

35:46.531 --> 35:49.754
People would discard black books, you know, African or Negro books.

35:50.155 --> 35:53.858
And everything that said Negro, African, I mean, in other words,

35:55.323 --> 36:00.131
Some of my better books did not say Negro, African, colored, West Indian.

36:00.451 --> 36:05.199
I began to learn the value of the bibliography.

36:05.700 --> 36:07.303
My mind became like a computer.

36:07.763 --> 36:09.005
I could go into a bookstore.

36:09.026 --> 36:09.767
I could see a title.

36:09.787 --> 36:13.273
It doesn't have to say Negro, black, but I would recognize an author or a title.

36:13.353 --> 36:14.735
I'm drawing the books.

36:14.775 --> 36:20.284
Even today, I have a feeling, internal feeling, I guess you would call it, that

36:20.888 --> 36:24.111
You know, I'm a hard worker and all, but there's days I need to just go.

36:24.131 --> 36:25.313
I get the feeling I have to go out.

36:25.573 --> 36:29.597
And sure enough, somewhere, there's something different out there for me.

36:29.657 --> 36:33.401
It's like I relax in bookstores, in Korean bookstores, you know.

36:34.542 --> 36:35.663
People say, how can you relax?

36:35.703 --> 36:36.864
But I do, you know.

36:36.924 --> 36:41.429
It's therapy for me, like a long-distance runner jogging, you know.

36:41.449 --> 36:42.530
I mean, you have time to think.

36:42.570 --> 36:49.377
Since I was an athlete, you know, and I jogged and all that, but it was the efficacy of...

36:49.643 --> 36:52.032
of being there, the calmness, you know.

36:52.474 --> 36:52.995
Serenity.

36:53.036 --> 36:54.019
Serenity.

36:54.180 --> 36:54.842
And discovery.

36:55.063 --> 36:55.906
And discovery.

36:55.967 --> 36:56.428
Beautiful.

36:57.653 --> 36:58.998
How many people can you talk to?

36:59.018 --> 37:01.206
The first thing I do when I go into a new city

37:01.557 --> 37:04.381
be it Omaha, Nebraska, Des Moines, Iowa.

37:04.461 --> 37:08.727
I look in the other pages of the used bookstores.

37:08.948 --> 37:11.731
Yes, that's the first thing I used to.

37:11.912 --> 37:13.714
I ask people, where am I?

37:13.895 --> 37:17.880
If I say, you got 15 minutes, can you drive me to the used bookstores?

37:18.221 --> 37:19.603
And I'll get lost in here.

37:19.703 --> 37:21.445
I don't even know what time it is.

37:21.465 --> 37:29.016
Well, Lenny Moore and Rosie used to, and other people, remember the team, Jesse Arnaldo, me and some of the other, used to go to the

37:29.587 --> 37:34.013
to sorority houses first, you know, in the Spain city and all, whether in Boston or whatever.

37:34.454 --> 37:35.715
I would always go to the bookstores.

37:35.735 --> 37:36.336
Then I would go.

37:36.356 --> 37:37.638
Then you would go to the sorority house.

37:37.658 --> 37:38.599
You would go to the bookstore.

37:38.619 --> 37:40.141
Well, Lenny and Rosie would, you know.

37:41.483 --> 37:41.984
That's funny.

37:42.024 --> 37:43.145
That's cute.

37:44.247 --> 37:45.248
Oh, boy.

37:45.368 --> 37:46.310
Lenny, Lenny, Lenny.

37:46.330 --> 37:46.830
Number 74.

37:46.850 --> 37:47.832
Yeah, Lenny's my best friend.

37:47.852 --> 37:48.633
I didn't talk to anybody.

37:48.653 --> 37:50.075
He's my best friend.

37:50.655 --> 37:51.156
This is me.

37:51.558 --> 37:54.742
against West Virginia.

37:54.762 --> 37:56.724
Do you remember those days?

37:56.744 --> 37:59.848
This is where it was Penn State and Syracuse.

38:01.270 --> 38:02.511
This is the track.

38:03.152 --> 38:04.874
Rosie and I were just like, Wyatt was a roommate.

38:04.994 --> 38:08.598
And Lenny was... That's G-R-I-E-R in that.

38:08.618 --> 38:09.279
Yeah.

38:09.680 --> 38:12.363
Then there's Rod Perry who was on the track team.

38:12.643 --> 38:13.544
He played in Swats.

38:13.584 --> 38:18.610
He played with the husband of Jesse Tyson and Miss Jane Pittman.

38:18.851 --> 38:20.873
Rod Perry, you know?

38:21.089 --> 38:22.831
He's from Coatesville.

38:23.111 --> 38:24.633
We were here on the same track team.

38:24.973 --> 38:28.717
So we had, this is Chick Warner, our track team.

38:28.737 --> 38:34.123
Yes, this is me here, right here, with Franklin Steel.

38:34.944 --> 38:38.047
See, look, see?

38:38.067 --> 38:42.392
Rose and I were his wife, it looks like that.

38:42.412 --> 38:45.575
On the one hand, I said, Lenny and I were all here, number 32, right here.

38:45.595 --> 38:46.476
You're number 42?

38:46.536 --> 38:47.097
Yeah.

38:47.465 --> 38:48.787
Number 42 was Lenny.

38:48.807 --> 38:49.929
Number 42 was Lenny.

38:50.089 --> 38:51.250
Lenny was 32.

38:51.431 --> 38:54.195
Is that always your number, by the way?

38:54.255 --> 38:54.635
Yeah, mm-hmm.

38:54.655 --> 38:55.336
See, it's Lenny here.

38:55.356 --> 38:58.561
That's a pretty great number, you know.

38:58.641 --> 38:59.683
A lot of people have had it.

38:59.703 --> 39:02.647
And we played against Jim Brown, and I played against Jim Brown.

39:02.927 --> 39:05.491
O.J., a lot of the other guys have had, isn't O.J.'

39:05.471 --> 39:06.092
's number 32?

39:06.332 --> 39:07.133
Yeah, 32.

39:08.095 --> 39:09.677
And here's, look, here's me.

39:09.697 --> 39:10.538
They're describing me.

39:11.880 --> 39:12.862
We played against Pitt.

39:12.962 --> 39:14.684
This is my sophomore year.

39:15.325 --> 39:16.527
You know, my junior year,

39:17.317 --> 39:18.178
No, my sophomore year.

39:18.218 --> 39:18.999
We upset J.C.

39:19.039 --> 39:19.860
Carroll.

39:19.880 --> 39:23.724
We upset what you call him.

39:23.744 --> 39:24.866
Oh, okay.

39:24.886 --> 39:25.006
Right.

39:25.026 --> 39:25.306
Mm-hmm.

39:27.188 --> 39:27.309
Yeah.

39:27.329 --> 39:28.990
Okay.

39:29.010 --> 39:29.972
You played against Jim Brown?

39:30.192 --> 39:30.592
Oh, yeah.

39:30.612 --> 39:31.313
Did you get that?

39:31.674 --> 39:31.994
Oh, yeah.

39:32.014 --> 39:32.935
But I was big, too.

39:33.015 --> 39:33.956
I mean, I was a big four.

39:35.138 --> 39:36.479
Here's what you call him.

39:36.499 --> 39:37.620
This is my sophomore year.

39:38.041 --> 39:38.782
They call me here.

39:38.802 --> 39:42.406
They say this is the only nuisance for Penn State.

39:42.426 --> 39:45.990
There's Tony Raiders and the Sterling Rocks a sophomore.

39:46.139 --> 39:51.366
He's as good a back as some of the top kids we've seen all year.

39:51.787 --> 39:53.269
Certainly he's as fast.

39:53.289 --> 39:54.791
He's the Jake.

39:54.811 --> 39:57.475
And then it says, Marion Martin.

39:57.495 --> 39:59.197
It blocks him just runs over him.

39:59.738 --> 40:02.902
He doesn't believe in being fancy.

40:03.323 --> 40:05.886
They wanted me to go to Pitt.

40:05.906 --> 40:06.928
I had 60 scholarships.

40:07.148 --> 40:07.528
60?

40:07.729 --> 40:09.451
Yeah, football and track in high school.

40:09.471 --> 40:09.651
Wow.

40:09.972 --> 40:11.774
You know, here's another one.

40:11.794 --> 40:13.797
You know what I can hear?

40:13.857 --> 40:15.199
This part?

40:15.219 --> 40:15.319
Yeah.

40:15.552 --> 40:19.998
They're so doggone big, I don't think we'll ever hit a team as big.

40:21.761 --> 40:24.585
This is one of my... This is high school, right?

40:24.605 --> 40:26.788
No, this is Penn State.

40:27.169 --> 40:28.231
Penn State, okay.

40:28.311 --> 40:29.753
University of Pittsburgh.

40:30.634 --> 40:33.158
Here's one of my local write-ups.

40:33.739 --> 40:34.760
This is Coach Engel.

40:35.441 --> 40:36.903
It's my sophomore year now.

40:38.686 --> 40:41.610
This is where I was

40:41.877 --> 40:45.822
A youngster like Charlie Blockson renews your faith in mankind.

40:45.842 --> 40:48.645
That's Rip Engle, E-N-G-L-E.

40:48.665 --> 40:49.806
Who brought Joe Paterno?

40:50.046 --> 40:51.748
That's right, Joe succeeded him.

40:51.788 --> 40:52.669
The year I was there.

40:52.850 --> 40:53.771
Yeah, that's right.

40:53.791 --> 40:54.672
Joe came in the next year.

40:54.712 --> 40:55.993
I was down there at 66, 67.

40:56.033 --> 40:56.774
That's right.

40:56.794 --> 41:03.362
And Joe was like, you know, he was like a system when I made the national trade.

41:03.382 --> 41:05.404
This was my freshman year.

41:05.688 --> 41:07.450
You're kind of proud of all this stuff.

41:07.790 --> 41:07.930
Huh?

41:07.950 --> 41:10.052
You're showing me, you know, the sports stuff.

41:10.232 --> 41:11.233
You're very proud of it.

41:11.253 --> 41:12.855
No, yeah, because this is my background.

41:12.875 --> 41:13.916
This is the foundation.

41:13.936 --> 41:26.648
This is how I got, this is what they say about Rosie and I, see?

41:26.708 --> 41:26.989
Okay.

41:28.951 --> 41:35.577
At what point did you realize, did it go from getting books to serious things?

41:36.417 --> 41:42.622
Did you realize that you weren't just collecting for yourself, you were building an archive?

41:42.642 --> 41:44.444
Well, I'm trying to think.

41:44.464 --> 41:47.006
I'm going back to my mind and giving so many interviews.

41:47.887 --> 42:06.103
I guess I really started thinking, when I used to go to New York, to the Schomburg, S-C-H-O-M-B-E-R-G collection, when I went to the Schomburg, you know, after indoor track meet at Madison Square Garden,

42:08.513 --> 42:09.774
I won the National.

42:09.954 --> 42:11.496
I was second.

42:11.536 --> 42:13.298
I just missed it.

42:13.578 --> 42:16.401
My junior year, the indoor meeting.

42:16.421 --> 42:17.201
I was second.

42:18.262 --> 42:25.589
My senior year, I won the National AU High School Indoor Shopkins Championship at Madison Square Garden, the old Madison Square Garden.

42:26.070 --> 42:27.611
And then I took a trip.

42:28.112 --> 42:29.773
I took the A train to Harlem.

42:30.214 --> 42:32.196
Remember Duke Ellington, the A train to Harlem?

42:32.296 --> 42:34.298
And then I got off at the Schomburg Center.

42:35.159 --> 42:36.580
And as I described my article,

42:36.982 --> 42:53.058
It just blew my mind, you know, to know that there was a collection of African books by black people written about and by black people that went back to the beginning of time, you know, and to see that they were all compiled in one room.

42:53.538 --> 43:02.967
You know, it had a profound influence on me to know that I was not a loner in collecting, you know, books about our people.

43:03.388 --> 43:04.609
It gave me...

43:04.994 --> 43:08.238
the encouragement, the stimulation that I needed.

43:09.519 --> 43:19.070
Well, the Schomburg collection, to know that Schomburg was a collector and that he had a similar experience of what I had as a child.

43:19.431 --> 43:22.134
He was told that he didn't have any history or history.

43:22.154 --> 43:29.943
Matter of fact, today, some of the people call me the modern Schomburg because he sold his collection for $10,000, which was nothing in those days.

43:30.404 --> 43:33.347
He had about 10,000 books

43:33.496 --> 43:37.881
I donated 20,000 items here, but today people said our lives are similar.

43:38.342 --> 43:44.609
Here, it was like divine guidance, whatever, for me to go up there that day to see all these books.

43:44.629 --> 43:48.794
And that's when I think I realized that I was a black bivio-phile.

43:49.194 --> 43:53.139
You know, I, it didn't consume me.

43:53.239 --> 43:59.706
I mean, it wasn't... The day you saw the Schaumburg... The Schaumburg... And all those collections of people who... And those pictures of...

44:00.007 --> 44:11.305
distinguished black people, the statue of Ira Aldridge, the great black Shakespearean actor, I mean, the replica of... Vincent de Schaumburg.

44:11.325 --> 44:12.326
Vincent de Schaumburg, yes.

44:12.667 --> 44:20.960
You know, it's a beautiful piece of sculpture, and that's, because I always loved sculptures when I was a child, but the fact that that stimulated me... It's kind of like a shrine, isn't it?

44:21.180 --> 44:21.440
Yes.

44:21.841 --> 44:22.262
For you.

44:22.282 --> 44:23.724
Yes, it was a shrine.

44:24.585 --> 44:26.368
It was a shrine of...

44:26.703 --> 44:28.505
of intellectual knowledge.

44:28.565 --> 44:36.754
It was a shrine that reminded me of ancient Timbuktu, where I read about some of the books that I had about Timbuktu.

44:37.015 --> 44:40.458
Up until that time, I thought that Timbuktu was a state of mind.

44:40.498 --> 44:44.303
If you had an argument with a friend, you'd say, oh, I wish you were in Timbuktu.

44:44.323 --> 44:52.592
But when I found that Timbuktu was a state of Africa, a place, a mystical place in Africa,

44:52.808 --> 44:57.496
that no longer today is important.

44:57.556 --> 45:01.743
But during that time, their top commodity wasn't gold, it was books.

45:02.144 --> 45:05.670
You know, I mean, scholars gave them all over the world, I mean, to learn.

45:06.151 --> 45:09.276
So I always had the secret desire to go to Timbuktu.

45:09.437 --> 45:11.761
One day that I want to, I'm going to go.

45:11.821 --> 45:17.230
The fact that being at Schomburg has stimulated me in becoming a collector.

45:17.632 --> 45:18.413
an obsession.

45:18.753 --> 45:19.695
Was it a challenge?

45:19.875 --> 45:20.376
It was a challenge.

45:20.396 --> 45:22.138
I would never say it was an obsession.

45:22.178 --> 45:25.102
Some people, as you know, some collectors have an obsession.

45:25.162 --> 45:25.843
And you say you don't?

45:26.163 --> 45:30.909
I don't, no, because, I mean, no, you see, my life is sports.

45:30.929 --> 45:35.976
You know, I mean, what you see now has been accumulated over years.

45:36.056 --> 45:38.880
I mean, I don't think about books every day.

45:38.920 --> 45:39.981
Well, it's a way of life, though.

45:40.001 --> 45:41.283
It's a way, it's a part of it.

45:41.303 --> 45:44.667
But even then, I have a Sagittarian interest in life.

45:45.368 --> 45:46.049
Sagittarian?

45:46.149 --> 45:46.930
I'm a Sagittarian.

45:47.399 --> 45:49.241
interest in life.

45:49.261 --> 45:50.843
I mean, I have interest in a lot of things.

45:51.223 --> 45:54.647
I never let one thing dominate, because it was always more learned.

45:54.667 --> 45:56.108
This is typical of Sagittarius?

45:56.468 --> 46:00.693
Yeah, we're curious, and we're searchers, you know, the scientist, the hunter, and so forth.

46:01.093 --> 46:03.896
I mean, I... Do you believe that stuff?

46:04.457 --> 46:05.618
I believe in all of that, of course.

46:06.879 --> 46:07.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:07.900 --> 46:09.742
No, I mean... I'm not putting it down.

46:09.842 --> 46:10.543
No, no.

46:10.603 --> 46:14.027
I believe that, you know, there's certain influences that we have.

46:14.387 --> 46:15.849
I believe in all religions.

46:15.949 --> 46:16.309
I mean,

46:16.559 --> 46:17.961
I have friends who are atheists.

46:18.041 --> 46:19.042
I mean, I have an open mind.

46:19.162 --> 46:24.287
I mean, you really believe that having been born under a certain sign to some degree influences the way you are.

46:25.429 --> 46:26.770
A little bit, yeah.

46:26.890 --> 46:30.594
I would say a percentage of it, yeah.

46:30.614 --> 46:35.059
I would say a percentage of a certain sign, because I'm not the people.

46:35.079 --> 46:37.882
I don't want to get into that.

46:38.082 --> 46:38.563
No, it's not.

46:38.583 --> 46:39.584
I'm curious here.

46:39.624 --> 46:40.204
But it's good.

46:40.365 --> 46:42.086
But to me.

46:42.206 --> 46:43.148
It's really quite irrelevant.

46:43.168 --> 46:43.968
It's a good quote.

46:44.028 --> 46:45.009
It's a good quote.

46:45.350 --> 46:46.431
But also, it's good.

46:46.647 --> 46:47.228
I'm a hunter.

46:47.388 --> 46:48.470
I'm a searcher.

46:48.490 --> 46:49.792
The son of a Sagittarian.

46:49.812 --> 46:50.613
That I like a lot.

46:50.633 --> 46:51.975
This is why I'm saying it.

46:51.995 --> 46:53.417
I don't believe in a fool, no.

46:53.697 --> 46:54.939
People read it every day, no.

46:54.959 --> 46:58.504
You know, I first got that thought about you when I asked you.

46:58.524 --> 47:01.028
You don't have a first Uncle Tom's cabin.

47:01.048 --> 47:02.250
And you said, well, it's too much money.

47:04.092 --> 47:06.716
You don't have a first edition of that.

47:07.377 --> 47:11.403
No, because... A really obsessed person would want... No, I know, but not me.

47:11.463 --> 47:14.848
I mean, Uncle Tom's cabin, I mean, it's important...

47:15.267 --> 47:16.248
But I have Wheatley's.

47:16.449 --> 47:17.550
Historically, as much as any.

47:17.610 --> 47:19.293
Yes, I mean, the first edition, yes.

47:19.733 --> 47:22.077
I mean, it's a key book for any collection.

47:22.117 --> 47:24.500
I mean, I have, someday I'll get it, you know.

47:24.520 --> 47:27.264
But my point is the obsessed collector.

47:27.605 --> 47:29.467
Right, that's right, that's right.

47:29.587 --> 47:32.632
He wouldn't even search you, no matter what kind of money, you know.

47:33.213 --> 47:35.576
I have sacrifice, you know.

47:35.936 --> 47:42.065
I've had holes in my shoes as a child, you know, wearing cardboard in order to get a book.

47:42.145 --> 47:43.367
Of course, I went through that.

47:43.567 --> 47:47.473
I'd save pennies, you know, I'd shine shoes, you know, to get another money.

47:47.533 --> 47:51.298
At that time... Is there anything you really covet that you'd like to have?

47:52.400 --> 47:53.982
Maybe covet's too strong a word.

47:54.002 --> 48:01.873
Well, no, see, there's a book, several books on top of my... You must have a one.

48:02.794 --> 48:08.743
The piece by Juan Latino, you know, his piece... Oh, my God.

48:09.103 --> 48:10.125
Let's don't worry about it.

48:10.165 --> 48:12.308
Yeah, there's a couple, like...

48:16.203 --> 48:41.492
See, when talking to you, there's so many things that, you know, I'm trying to give you things I never had before, never said before, plus the fact that there's so much about book collecting, you know, I mean, the types of books I have, you know, I collect in every phase the breadth and depth of the African diaspora, which covers, you know, wherever black people live today on this earth.

48:41.612 --> 48:45.096
I have interest, you know, I have some children's books,

48:45.464 --> 48:52.693
all the way up to books on erotica, black erotica, which I have a piece by Pushkin, a book by Pushkin that he did, you know.

48:53.013 --> 49:00.722
Then I have books by the church on books of people in Brazil, poetry, music, literature.

49:00.762 --> 49:11.775
I mean, this is why people, when they come to the collection, they are satisfied because I'm able to, within the collection, I have

49:12.683 --> 49:20.514
information on various subjects where sometimes you have to go to one library from one thing, another from, you know, this is why people have written these from all over.

49:21.415 --> 49:28.425
I, when I started collecting, Nick, I started to collect the whole of our history, which I'm glad I did.

49:28.465 --> 49:30.909
Some people collected, as you know, specialized.

49:30.949 --> 49:32.671
Well, this is really a scholar's collection.

49:32.932 --> 49:36.096
This actually is a research collection.

49:36.116 --> 49:36.797
Yes, yes.

49:36.817 --> 49:41.003
This is not a private focused collection of 315 lovely items.

49:41.320 --> 49:46.868
which are fascinating to the person who owns it, but really it's not going to help the scholar in any great way.

49:46.888 --> 49:52.237
The scholar has to come in and have a lot of stuff in a lot of different areas that's going to help he or she.

49:53.539 --> 49:56.223
You answered the question a while ago, when did I decide?

49:56.824 --> 49:59.428
It evolved within itself.

50:00.008 --> 50:03.053
I couldn't have planned it any better than what I've had.

50:03.193 --> 50:05.817
How many people do you know of who started in a hobby?

50:05.857 --> 50:09.623
It wasn't an advocacy hobby, call it what you will.

50:09.974 --> 50:12.597
a force, an energy force.

50:12.637 --> 50:23.768
I mean, coming from a statement, partially from a teacher's statement, to be able to enjoy what I started out collecting.

50:23.788 --> 50:27.712
I mean, I'm working at a position that I created in my own job.

50:27.772 --> 50:28.953
It's like it's not even a job.

50:28.993 --> 50:29.794
You understand what I mean?

50:29.814 --> 50:37.602
It's like the greatest thing for me is when people come in here, an elderly person, a senior citizen,

50:37.936 --> 50:45.529
You know, there are groups that come in from all over, and they say, son, if you're elected to them, thank you for telling me who I am before I die.

50:46.050 --> 50:57.430
You know, I mean, this is what our child, for the children from the local community, from all over, they come from Princeton, Washington, you see school trips, you know.

50:57.730 --> 50:59.632
At first they're sort of fidgety and they come in here.

50:59.912 --> 51:10.663
Then you show them a Phyllis Wheatley signed Phyllis Wheatley or something written by Langston Hughes or Turner or James Baldwin or Leo Africanus who wrote about the history of Timbuktu.

51:11.024 --> 51:18.752
And their eyes, you know, the light in a child's eyes, you know, and how they thank you.

51:18.812 --> 51:22.135
They don't want to leave.

51:22.300 --> 51:24.022
Football, pro football and all that.

51:25.063 --> 51:27.826
That isn't, you know, or any other profession.

51:28.847 --> 51:33.452
You know, money isn't, what I'm saying to you, money isn't everything.

51:33.733 --> 51:41.702
Sure, I could have bought an Uncle Tom Camden years ago, but my greatest ecstasy is in giving.

51:41.722 --> 51:43.764
In giving.

51:44.425 --> 51:44.865
It's not

51:45.149 --> 51:53.117
I'm not a Sarah Thomas Phillips, you know, obsession, you know, magnificent obsession to acquire, like some people.

51:53.418 --> 51:56.821
I don't want every scrap of paper written by an author.

51:57.102 --> 51:58.803
If I get it, okay.

51:58.823 --> 52:01.746
What is meant for me, my golden rule out of the black video follows.

52:02.087 --> 52:03.809
What is meant for me, I will have.

52:04.269 --> 52:05.831
What is not meant for me, I will not have.

52:06.111 --> 52:10.115
So I don't become upset over obsession, over searching.

52:10.135 --> 52:14.700
However, it is of singular importance to you, and it's already been accomplished,

52:15.406 --> 52:26.280
If this collection be maintained as a collection, you know, one of the themes that I'm exploring is why some people pass it, I mean, send it up to auction or break it up.

52:26.300 --> 52:38.415
No, no, so you're getting questions, you're giving me answers to questions, that you, as a bibliophile, it's so easy, it's beautiful talking to you, because you feel, I can feel the beauty in your presence.

52:39.136 --> 52:42.240
I could not, one of my stipulations in my contract

52:42.625 --> 52:52.375
When I donated, I could have stole this collection, was the fact that it must forever, as long as the university is here, to be intact.

52:52.435 --> 52:56.668
None of these books cannot circulate.

52:57.273 --> 53:02.381
Sure, from time to time, it's the Smith-Thirty Library of Congress, someone wanted to use for exhibition.

53:03.062 --> 53:07.529
The Morgan Library will loan the Huntington Library an item.

53:07.609 --> 53:08.871
Yes, yes, yes.

53:08.911 --> 53:14.960
You know, this is a standard procedure among similar institutions.

53:14.980 --> 53:16.081
That's right.

53:16.262 --> 53:20.548
And some items that will never leave.

53:21.269 --> 53:25.035
There are certain books, like maybe a weekly,

53:25.285 --> 53:31.634
Maybe a Wheatley, maybe a Nat Turner, or something.

53:31.654 --> 53:37.722
Is this, by the way, is this the really great, is this the stuff that you have chosen to be in the office with you?

53:38.222 --> 53:38.343
Mm-mm.

53:38.783 --> 53:41.307
Or is this just stuff that happens to be in the office with you?

53:41.367 --> 53:46.834
It happened to be here because we don't have the extra space, but we don't, and plus the size.

53:46.854 --> 53:48.957
I was reaching, I was reaching a little too far.

53:49.017 --> 53:50.319
No, no, no, but that's a good thought.

53:51.180 --> 53:52.862
That's a good thought, Nick, because

53:53.686 --> 53:55.248
Books are food for my soul.

53:55.268 --> 53:57.792
I have books in my bedroom.

53:58.433 --> 53:59.194
I have books here.

53:59.234 --> 54:06.023
I mean, when you come in here, when people, certain people come into the collection, I want to get back to you and answer your question.

54:06.984 --> 54:09.668
Certain people come to Charles or Mr. Box and we come in here.

54:10.449 --> 54:12.332
Some people come here and stay at the door.

54:12.372 --> 54:15.156
They stay there for a minute and they pause.

54:15.937 --> 54:19.862
Some people come with tears in the eyes in the large structure in the room.

54:20.500 --> 54:22.723
They said they could feel the presence.

54:22.743 --> 54:26.106
I mean, not all people, and first people were growing the books.

54:27.228 --> 54:28.849
I don't know how you felt when you came to my office.

54:28.870 --> 54:30.531
I don't know how you felt when you came over there.

54:31.112 --> 54:35.837
But the thing is, this is what I'm saying.

54:36.238 --> 54:37.139
These are my friends.

54:37.179 --> 54:39.181
These are my ancestors.

54:39.201 --> 54:42.966
These books represent their lives, their trials and tribulations, and so forth.

54:43.286 --> 54:46.930
When I'm depressed at times or whatever, I mean, I come in here.

54:47.264 --> 54:50.331
as a reminder of what, say, Harry Tudman went through.

54:50.371 --> 54:51.754
Harry Tudman.

54:51.854 --> 54:53.238
I'm just saying that from my time.

54:53.298 --> 54:55.543
Harry Tudman, you know, who led the Underground Railroad.

54:55.563 --> 54:57.587
Later I wrote this article, this cover story.

54:57.828 --> 54:58.630
Just for my typist.

54:58.650 --> 54:59.051
Okay.

54:59.151 --> 54:59.792
The cover story.

54:59.812 --> 55:02.659
I think it's a cover story of a National Geographic magazine.

55:02.879 --> 55:04.463
I don't know if I got that.

55:04.645 --> 55:07.069
I read the cover story.

55:07.369 --> 55:08.671
I'm familiar.

55:08.691 --> 55:09.192
I'm sorry.

55:09.552 --> 55:12.537
I wrote two articles for that.

55:12.557 --> 55:13.859
That's pretty terrific.

55:13.899 --> 55:15.862
I mean, I'm going to get a copy of it at some point.

55:15.882 --> 55:16.763
Yeah, let me see.

55:16.843 --> 55:18.366
I think I have extra.

55:18.806 --> 55:20.669
Let me keep talking next.

55:20.970 --> 55:21.811
I'll replace it.

55:21.831 --> 55:23.453
Well, I'd like you to do the same with it.

55:23.473 --> 55:25.296
You're going to give me one.

55:25.997 --> 55:26.278
Of course.

55:26.298 --> 55:29.202
What I'm going to do here, and I'll replace it from here.

55:29.418 --> 55:33.003
I mean, they came to me, the National Geographic magazine.

55:33.023 --> 55:34.665
I just love this.

55:34.745 --> 55:36.407
And I thought it was a joke at first.

55:36.848 --> 55:38.410
You know, I wrote two articles for them.

55:38.890 --> 55:40.392
I wrote one of the Sea Islands.

55:40.973 --> 55:45.639
It's called Sea Change in the Sea Islands, December of 87.

55:45.659 --> 55:56.634
It's about the people, the Gullah-speaking people down in Charleston, South Carolina area, who is called Sea Change in the Sea Islands.

55:56.674 --> 55:58.356
Sea Change in the Sea Islands, right?

55:58.376 --> 55:59.037
Nowhere...

55:59.101 --> 56:00.903
To lay down weary head.

56:01.103 --> 56:02.024
That's a quote.

56:02.064 --> 56:04.006
This is by me and the photographer.

56:04.346 --> 56:06.028
See, it tells about the... Oh, that's great.

56:06.328 --> 56:08.590
It tells about the... I'm very impressed.

56:09.531 --> 56:12.094
That's one of the great ones to hit, is geographic as a writer.

56:12.154 --> 56:15.637
This made my Book of the Month, one of the Book of the Months, called Choice Book of the Months.

56:15.657 --> 56:16.338
This is your book?

56:16.538 --> 56:16.939
Yeah.

56:16.959 --> 56:17.099
Mm-hmm.

56:20.622 --> 56:23.986
I'm trying to get you together.

56:24.006 --> 56:24.366
The old...

56:24.751 --> 56:31.338
I won a national award for putting it together, 300 years in Pennsylvania State.

56:32.400 --> 56:33.421
Who did this catalog?

56:33.781 --> 56:35.743
It was a company that we hired.

56:35.823 --> 56:36.604
I was in charge.

56:36.624 --> 56:37.645
I was the director of it.

56:37.706 --> 56:39.788
Are there any more copies of this?

56:39.988 --> 56:43.532
That's probably the only one, right?

56:43.572 --> 56:43.973
Yeah.

56:43.993 --> 56:47.957
These are things I did that I keep in here.

56:48.308 --> 56:49.930
And I'll give you this here, didn't I?

56:49.950 --> 56:51.031
This is the day they honor me.

56:51.752 --> 56:53.354
What are you looking for now?

56:53.374 --> 56:55.476
You're looking for the geographic on the Underground Railroad.

56:57.378 --> 56:57.859
Here we go.

56:57.879 --> 56:58.820
Here's the one you can have.

56:58.880 --> 56:59.941
I'll give another copy of that one.

57:00.202 --> 57:01.823
Okay, I'm going to write down the stuff on this book.

57:03.606 --> 57:11.314
We're talking about a Pushkin erotic poem from the Virgin Mary, Alexander Pushkin, and that P-U-S-H-K-I-N.

57:12.255 --> 57:16.240
Gavrilida, G-A-V-R-I-L-I-A-D-A.

57:17.688 --> 57:19.491
Is that what you pay for it?

57:20.212 --> 57:21.074
You had to have it, right?

57:21.094 --> 57:22.817
You know, because it's also a new guy.

57:22.837 --> 57:43.611
It's by Pushkin who has African ancestors, plus the fact, you know, he was well known as Alexander Dumas of his black ancestors, plus the fact it's a book of erotica, and his double days publishing a book of erotica, this, that comes next spring, that will be dedicated to me.

57:43.996 --> 57:47.681
Because of the people, like Alice Walker, I got.

57:48.042 --> 57:48.643
Alice Walker.

57:48.683 --> 57:50.866
You know, the writer, and a lot of the writers and so forth.

57:50.886 --> 57:52.408
Tony Morrison probably was here.

57:52.589 --> 58:01.422
Well, Tony's not in the book, but the editors, you know, they said, Charles, you give us Dr. Miriam de Costa-Willis, who came up with the idea.

58:01.462 --> 58:03.325
She's at the University of Maryland now.

58:03.345 --> 58:06.309
She was at George Mason.

58:06.329 --> 58:11.657
She said, her husband said, before he died, she said, you're always writing these

58:11.907 --> 58:13.670
academic books that no one was going to read.

58:13.690 --> 58:15.413
Why didn't you write a good sex book?

58:15.433 --> 58:18.778
And after he died, she thought about it and not become remorse.

58:18.798 --> 58:19.700
She had three children.

58:19.820 --> 58:22.083
One of her sons is a judge in Memphis.

58:22.404 --> 58:24.107
She said, Charles, I came up with the idea.

58:24.347 --> 58:31.158
So she sent this flower out, a flyer, asking people to, you know, write an erotica.

58:31.539 --> 58:34.584
And then a couple people gave her my collection.

58:34.964 --> 58:35.805
And I helped her.

58:35.866 --> 58:36.767
And she said, well,

58:37.220 --> 58:42.089
Well, I was low, and the other editors used stimulators and got all of these people laying all this.

58:42.389 --> 58:47.659
So they dedicated this book to me, the anthology on Zacharyonica.

58:47.679 --> 58:50.904
Some of them, well, they have people like Dennis Brutus.

58:50.964 --> 58:55.052
I mean, most of these people, the writers... I'm going to go on the other side.

58:55.112 --> 58:55.212
Okay.
