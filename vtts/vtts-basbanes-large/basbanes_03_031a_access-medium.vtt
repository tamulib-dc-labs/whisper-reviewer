WEBVTT

00:02.292 --> 00:08.702
...with Lieutenant Colonel McNerney at the Halstead Library, 14 March, 2006.

00:08.782 --> 00:23.846
We're standing by some of the books that have been recently acquired for this library, and we're just looking at really several hundred readers' digest condensed books, and you were about to say, Brian.

00:23.986 --> 00:30.156
Well, among these, we also have the special edition large type,

00:30.322 --> 00:43.664
which might be good especially for someone learning English, such as these books, ultimately all the books in the library are ultimately intended to be donated to Iraqis when the time comes that the Americans leave.

00:44.225 --> 00:45.748
And in the interim, we'll be donating some.

00:45.768 --> 00:54.422
So I think the Leaders Digest volumes actually make good nominees for early donations because

00:54.689 --> 00:57.293
First of all, each one has four or five different books.

00:57.313 --> 01:01.440
So with each volume, the Iraqis are really getting three, four, five books.

01:02.763 --> 01:05.367
Typically, these aren't extremely difficult literature.

01:05.447 --> 01:09.855
It's not like giving them a technical manual or a specialized piece of writing.

01:10.776 --> 01:13.341
And it obviously kind of has diversity built in.

01:14.342 --> 01:17.227
And it's been watered down, of course.

01:17.408 --> 01:18.890
But it is what it is.

01:18.910 --> 01:20.072
We know what they are.

01:20.356 --> 01:29.925
You're trying to find some use for what you've got, and I think that you're coming up with a strategy to use a number of these books that have come your way.

01:30.465 --> 01:37.631
Another one of the challenges I came across, when the books arrived, and there was about, I'd say about 300 boxes of books.

01:37.832 --> 01:39.173
And that's how many shipments have you had?

01:39.273 --> 01:40.734
There was one pallet shipment.

01:40.854 --> 01:42.095
And that was a couple weeks ago.

01:42.115 --> 01:43.697
And that was, I'd say, about a month ago.

01:43.957 --> 01:46.619
And I can go back later and check and find out when they physically arrived.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.321
I kept the shipping labels there.

01:49.077 --> 01:50.739
But I didn't know what was in the boxes.

01:50.799 --> 01:52.902
I told them, I said, look, you guys are donating.

01:52.922 --> 01:58.489
This is a drive orchestrated by the veterans from World War II, who I met last year in Germany.

01:59.170 --> 02:04.557
You guys send what you want to send, and we'll figure out what there is and how to make the best use of it.

02:04.577 --> 02:17.093
But for example, one of the things that I came across when I have now gone through that whole first set of books, and we have 600 more boxes coming, is you can see here, down in the bottom, and this entire box here,

02:18.035 --> 02:20.479
are nothing but Harlequin romances.

02:20.899 --> 02:26.567
So now, here I am, an Army soldier, sitting in Iraq, looking for books to give Iraqis.

02:28.230 --> 02:34.118
And I have, I don't know, what, maybe 300, 400 Harlequin romances.

02:34.138 --> 02:38.304
These are not typically books that Army male soldiers tend to read a lot.

02:39.025 --> 02:39.987
I mean, they're just not.

02:40.628 --> 02:47.738
So what I need to do is I need to find somewhere within the Army system

02:48.157 --> 02:49.839
where there's a large density of women.

02:50.479 --> 03:03.112
In addition, tomorrow, Mr. Matham, an Iraqi from Balad, the local city, will come, and I'll show him these, and through a translator, ask him if this would be something that would be acceptable to donate.

03:03.392 --> 03:10.579
Part of the issue with getting to Iraqis is you've got to consider whether the material is offensive or potentially offensive.

03:10.699 --> 03:14.603
Over here on this wall, I put all the religious-related literature.

03:14.954 --> 03:17.137
And, of course, you got a lot of that too, right?

03:17.157 --> 03:19.541
Well, again, we've got an entire shelf, basically.

03:19.561 --> 03:25.290
The top two shelves are straight to religion of all different kinds, mostly Bibles and Christian literature.

03:25.711 --> 03:33.643
The bottom two shelves, or the lower two shelves that are full there, are self-help manuals of every conceivable nature.

03:34.685 --> 03:43.138
And so I frankly think, here on the Hooper Boxes, I frankly think that a lot of it is stuff

03:43.608 --> 03:45.430
It's going to have very limited use.

03:46.731 --> 03:55.700
But, you know, I'll tell you, Nick, like I think most people that love books, I'm very, very averse to throwing any book away.

03:56.661 --> 03:59.824
Over here, out of all the books that I've opened, this is the only stack.

04:00.345 --> 04:05.010
This constitutes what I have already said is probably not suitable for anybody.

04:05.570 --> 04:09.434
And it's not suitable either because it's really obsolete.

04:09.854 --> 04:13.378
For example, dress well on $1 a day.

04:14.168 --> 04:18.312
Now, how long ago do you think it was since a person could dress well on $1 a day?

04:18.392 --> 04:20.134
As you look at the fashions on the front.

04:20.834 --> 04:26.099
I have to tell you, this is the kind of stuff you really got to tell them not to send.

04:26.420 --> 04:32.425
You'd be nice, but you're going to have to be, I think, for this weeded out.

04:32.666 --> 04:37.771
Before it comes here, you see, why would somebody say that?

04:37.791 --> 04:39.893
Now, this you might find interesting.

04:39.913 --> 04:41.374
The Army does have a program.

04:42.569 --> 04:45.713
to mail books to soldiers in the field.

04:45.733 --> 05:00.654
And through this Counts Agency, Curtis Libraries, Counts Library Services, Nicaragua Falls, New York, or Niagara Falls, this is an example of a box of books, all brand new books, all in good condition, that the Army mails for us to distribute to soldiers.

05:01.094 --> 05:04.699
It's just a variety package, basically.

05:04.719 --> 05:05.320
And so we do have that.

05:05.420 --> 05:10.808
You know, you've got this book here, Support Our Troops, Quotations on Patriotism, which I've actually, I know where it is.

05:11.168 --> 05:11.749
It's right up here.

05:12.252 --> 05:13.914
I set it aside.

05:13.934 --> 05:27.129
But what I did get, despite the odd stuff, stuff that probably is not going to have an audience, still, I think most of the stuff we got is going to be useful in some form or another.

05:27.630 --> 05:34.217
For example, over here, we look like a bunch of boxes.

05:34.658 --> 05:40.825
Each one of these boxes over here on this wall contains anywhere from, say, 20 to 50

05:41.041 --> 05:43.004
maybe 16 paperbacks.

05:43.024 --> 05:46.209
So every one of these is a load of paperback books.

05:46.229 --> 05:47.190
All of these.

05:47.210 --> 05:50.034
Not only these, but come here and look at this.

05:50.054 --> 05:52.177
This is the room that I'm trying to explain it to you.

05:52.198 --> 05:54.701
All these are pre-box paperbacks.

05:55.462 --> 05:57.465
All these are pre-box paperbacks.

05:58.146 --> 06:07.420
These boxes we will have, when convoys go out on the road across Iraq, other board operating bases, we will give the convoy two or three boxes.

06:07.872 --> 06:17.805
They will take the boxes to those fobs, those remote fobs that are not, you know, well-built up like here at Watt, and leave those boxes for soldiers that are out in the fringes.

06:18.967 --> 06:20.349
So... See, wouldn't it be great?

06:20.389 --> 06:22.992
Like, in World War II, they had the Armed Forces editions.

06:23.012 --> 06:24.534
Yeah, I would love to.

06:24.554 --> 06:30.422
I've considered trying to start collecting some of those, but... Well, I know some people, however, they're very hard to get them.

06:30.502 --> 06:31.344
They're very collectible.

06:31.864 --> 06:34.348
But what a great project that was.

06:34.568 --> 06:36.951
Unfortunately, wouldn't it be nice if there was something like that today?

06:37.572 --> 06:42.417
that we're getting books out to the guys and the gals.

06:42.738 --> 06:46.622
Now this area right here, this is what was originally here.

06:46.942 --> 06:52.268
In other words, when I first came over here three months ago, this was the only part of the library.

06:53.269 --> 06:54.411
This shelf was not here.

06:54.471 --> 06:57.514
There was a low, that shelf over there was here.

06:57.815 --> 06:59.136
This is one of the ones we had made.

06:59.176 --> 07:06.364
This was the only area that had books, and it was, I'd say it was 95% paperback, which I've already started moving.

07:06.985 --> 07:09.067
And we've started putting in all these hardback.

07:09.087 --> 07:11.289
These are bestsellers over here.

07:11.329 --> 07:20.877
What you see here in the corner, of course, these are all suspense and mysteries.

07:21.518 --> 07:25.921
I was amazed at how many suspense novels there were.

07:26.162 --> 07:28.584
Obviously these are very, very popular.

07:28.604 --> 07:36.891
One thing that's interesting about just asking for whatever people send is I think you do get a different read of the kind of books people collect.

07:37.630 --> 07:39.992
Well, I was collecting, so I should be reading.

07:40.012 --> 07:40.573
Or buy.

07:40.833 --> 07:44.336
The kind of books they buy, purchase, and keep for whatever reason.

07:44.897 --> 07:49.981
Either they give them away or throw them away or whatever they'll do with it.

07:50.061 --> 07:53.304
But this part, this will be Mystery Corner.

07:53.344 --> 07:55.807
This probably will be also Mysteries over here.

07:55.827 --> 07:59.210
We will probably keep that as a paperback shelf and make that as giveaways.

07:59.610 --> 08:01.292
So we'll always want some books to give away here.

08:01.772 --> 08:02.633
This is reference.

08:03.814 --> 08:05.355
You can see here I've got dictionaries.

08:05.435 --> 08:07.317
I've got foreign language books.

08:07.769 --> 08:10.413
I've got two New York Public Library books here.

08:11.234 --> 08:12.135
I've got some humor.

08:13.497 --> 08:15.200
And then most of this here is biography.

08:15.921 --> 08:20.488
And I'm just trying to get it all in one place right now.

08:22.090 --> 08:35.650
And so this section will mostly, the biographies you'll be able to check out, these best sellers over here, these are all books that I didn't, you know, if I put Tom Clancy, for example, in my fiction section, they'll eat up 10% of my space.

08:35.967 --> 08:38.790
gave these guys that I know that there's a lot of Robert Lovell.

08:39.251 --> 08:42.675
I know that there's a lot of... And this will be very popular.

08:42.875 --> 08:43.456
I think it will.

08:44.017 --> 08:47.120
This right here is a book that I told you about, a small town in Germany.

08:48.122 --> 08:52.347
I mean, the cover is actually in excellent condition.

08:53.648 --> 08:58.874
Although this is a book club edition, which to me I think is... You've got collectible books.

08:59.015 --> 09:01.097
It doesn't matter.

09:07.777 --> 09:08.118
Okay.

09:08.138 --> 09:09.441
You know, we have Gresham.

09:10.443 --> 09:12.688
This here is women's romance.

09:12.808 --> 09:22.671
Again, the popularity of Harlequin's and women's romance, I mean, this is the Barbara Delschitzky's, Belleville Plaine, Joan Collins, all that kind of stuff.

09:22.691 --> 09:23.693
I mean, I'll tell you,

09:24.162 --> 09:26.685
There are female soldiers over here that will gobble this up.

09:27.206 --> 09:28.528
And so it'll serve a function.

09:28.968 --> 09:32.673
But when you talk about ultimately going over to the Iraqis... I don't think that this would go.

09:33.334 --> 09:34.996
But I need the Iraqis to tell me that.

09:35.737 --> 09:50.355
The only thing I really will not give them is anything that is conceivably pornographic, evangelistic, religious materials, or something that maybe involves hate crimes or something of a...

09:50.605 --> 09:53.549
offensive political nature that would be insulting.

09:53.569 --> 10:00.819
Other than that, my objective is to give them as much of the material as I can and let them decide what is acceptable and what's not.

10:01.740 --> 10:03.402
But there are some subjective decisions.

10:03.422 --> 10:05.225
There are some cutoff points that have to be made.

10:06.667 --> 10:19.684
The point I made to them last week when I was in Balad is this is part of the responsibility of living in a democracy, is hearing voices that you may not personally approve of or agree with, but that's part of what

10:20.221 --> 10:22.625
That's part of the risk that we take a living in a democracy.

10:22.785 --> 10:31.999
So I really don't want to be in a position of censoring their reading, but I don't want to offend the Muslim sensibility either.

10:32.340 --> 10:34.343
And it's a balance, a delicate balance.

10:35.965 --> 10:38.890
So you get, I think, a sense of the size.

10:38.910 --> 10:41.454
This room is completely empty.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.396
This is literature.

10:43.897 --> 10:47.663
And the way I'm going to do literature, for the most part, paperbacks, I'm shipping out.

10:48.318 --> 10:54.543
With literature, I made an exception, and I thought, because this is a learning library also, I want to have an access, and here we have Faulkner.

10:54.563 --> 10:58.827
I want to make sure that soldiers have access to the great literature of our culture, so to speak.

10:59.488 --> 11:01.830
And, of course, there's a lot of subjective decisions made here.

11:01.850 --> 11:11.698
There's a lot of, say, Oprah Winfrey's picks that probably aren't literature in the classical sense, but are good enough that it meets the criteria.

11:11.738 --> 11:17.683
We've got Marcel Proust, Patrick O'Brien, John Steinbeck.

11:18.271 --> 11:21.334
There's a lot of good stuff here, Roberts and Davies.

11:21.854 --> 11:22.915
These are some interesting books.

11:22.935 --> 11:26.418
Some of these are signed by the authors.

11:27.760 --> 11:31.944
This here, I think I told you about yesterday, On Strategy, the Vietnam War in Context by Harry Summers.

11:33.105 --> 11:34.646
It obviously became a very popular book.

11:34.666 --> 11:40.231
It also has the Army War College fly leaf that was placed inside of General Merritt.

11:41.032 --> 11:43.494
That's kind of an odd little bit of a stain there to the left.

11:44.295 --> 11:46.557
But nonetheless, this became a document that was

11:47.178 --> 11:51.925
quite influential in professional military circles after Vietnam.

11:52.025 --> 11:56.732
It's the first real critique of the military's performance in that war.

11:57.634 --> 11:59.477
Here, we have a stack.

11:59.497 --> 12:07.148
These are two boxes and some loose books, all by the same woman, obviously mailed by her, probably, I mean... And she's the author?

12:07.709 --> 12:08.410
And she's the author.

12:08.430 --> 12:10.633
You know, one lady is the author.

12:10.653 --> 12:12.837
You think she said... I think she did.

12:12.857 --> 12:13.658
I think when they said...

12:13.925 --> 12:14.926
You know, bring books.

12:14.986 --> 12:15.567
She said, okay.

12:15.587 --> 12:16.988
So that's Uni, what's her name?

12:17.008 --> 12:17.929
Uni Hoell.

12:18.369 --> 12:19.310
Hoell, H-O-E-L.

12:19.350 --> 12:22.974
And there's at least, and here we have a picture of her, and there's at least... What does it say about her?

12:23.134 --> 12:29.139
...from Norway, born into a world of music, played at, uh, studied at the Oslo Music Conservatory.

12:29.159 --> 12:31.281
Okay, and who's the publisher, or is it self-published, I think?

12:32.102 --> 12:35.205
Um... You must have a lot of self-published books.

12:35.225 --> 12:38.068
Published by Pentland Press, Raleigh, North Carolina.

12:39.309 --> 12:42.632
So, very, very interesting, and three different books.

12:42.730 --> 12:49.219
Here, by her, the overtones, brittle cradle, and absolute pitch.

12:49.239 --> 12:50.621
I mean... It's fiction?

12:50.882 --> 12:56.510
It's, uh... Actually, I think it's a memoir.

12:57.792 --> 12:58.913
Although, you know what?

12:58.933 --> 12:59.454
Let me look.

12:59.474 --> 12:59.875
A novel.

13:00.055 --> 13:00.956
No, this is fiction.

13:00.976 --> 13:01.857
No, it's fiction, yeah.

13:02.278 --> 13:05.242
Printed on acid-free paper.

13:05.262 --> 13:09.328
I always... I think you're going to have to pull a lot.

13:09.967 --> 13:13.872
Well, you're going to have to do that.

13:17.076 --> 13:30.673
You're started, and that's fabulous, but if you're really going to try and create a library, you just can't take everything everyone sends you, you know?

13:31.354 --> 13:33.797
See, this is just the first.

13:37.388 --> 13:39.551
These are books about the Middle East.

13:39.712 --> 13:41.394
I segregated them from those over there.

13:41.414 --> 13:42.356
Let's see what you got there.

13:42.416 --> 13:42.997
What have we got?

13:43.538 --> 13:44.540
How many books have you got?

13:44.800 --> 13:46.923
I think I have about 3,000.

13:47.144 --> 13:48.065
And in here now?

13:48.105 --> 13:51.411
In here now, including in those boxes with paperbacks.

13:52.212 --> 13:57.861
Suez Through Egyptian Eyes, Arabia, A Journey Through the Labyrinth,

14:02.144 --> 14:03.145
Jonathan Rabban.

14:03.445 --> 14:04.526
Oh, really?

14:04.626 --> 14:05.587
I know him, yeah.

14:05.687 --> 14:07.970
He's a wonderful writer.

14:07.990 --> 14:10.192
That's an ex-libris, so that was formerly in a library.

14:11.253 --> 14:12.094
Here we got T.D.

14:12.194 --> 14:13.455
Lawrence, 1927.

14:15.517 --> 14:16.818
That's an ex-libris.

14:17.239 --> 14:17.419
U.S.

14:17.459 --> 14:19.561
Naval Training Station, San Diego, California.

14:21.223 --> 14:26.848
And that was printed in 19... Original copyright 26, but printed in 27.

14:26.868 --> 14:30.632
So that probably was printed, actually, not long after he wrote it.

14:31.355 --> 14:33.718
I got two copies of that.

14:33.938 --> 14:34.679
It's interesting.

14:34.699 --> 14:37.703
We have different paper bed editions.

14:39.045 --> 14:42.369
A bed of red flowers about Afghanistan.

14:42.609 --> 14:46.754
So these are books, obviously, that are of interest to what we're doing here.

14:47.455 --> 14:47.656
Sir?

14:48.316 --> 14:48.677
Yeah.

14:48.697 --> 14:51.561
Okay, let's see.

14:51.581 --> 14:52.722
Here's two right here.

14:53.005 --> 14:54.146
I got my sections.

14:54.166 --> 14:56.769
Don't put them in my sections because I know what to do.

14:56.789 --> 14:57.550
Block of instruction right here.

14:57.610 --> 14:59.072
Two soldiers, me and Roby will be back.

14:59.412 --> 15:00.694
Which section do you want Roby to start with?

15:00.734 --> 15:03.077
I just gotta go get a yellow ribbon right now.

15:03.097 --> 15:04.238
My section do I want him to start with?

15:04.258 --> 15:04.358
Yeah.

15:04.478 --> 15:06.681
Which one are you going to give him?

15:06.701 --> 15:08.663
Well, I guess it depends on what we want to do.

15:08.683 --> 15:17.153
If we want to alphabetize or if we want to... What I'm going to do is I'm going to have them both work together in here to finish off the mysteries and pull out the paperbacks.

15:17.173 --> 15:18.555
Do you want them to finish the mysteries?

15:18.915 --> 15:21.218
Yeah, and pull all those paperbacks out in boxes.

15:21.258 --> 15:21.358
Okay.

15:21.575 --> 15:24.581
So, when Roby comes in, he can work with me in this room.

15:24.601 --> 15:25.864
Okay, we'll be back.

15:26.285 --> 15:27.528
This is all fiction over here, too.

15:27.548 --> 15:28.851
This is all art-bound fiction.

15:30.193 --> 15:31.516
We'll be back in, like, 22 minutes.

15:31.697 --> 15:32.959
So, if you just get them going.

15:32.979 --> 15:33.220
22?

15:33.240 --> 15:34.122
22 minutes.

15:34.142 --> 15:36.787
Okay, because it was 17 from when you said you'd be here.

15:36.808 --> 15:39.714
But I had to print out on your computer, and I had to listen to Major Arnie.

15:40.054 --> 15:40.976
It would be bullshit.

15:40.996 --> 15:41.878
Did you get the sequence?

15:41.938 --> 15:42.199
There it is.

15:42.517 --> 15:44.599
No, I forgot all about that.

15:44.619 --> 15:45.720
Bill Jensen emailed you.

15:45.740 --> 15:46.922
I opened up that email for Bill.

15:46.942 --> 15:47.162
1745.

15:47.182 --> 15:48.623
1745, he wants us there?

15:48.904 --> 15:51.166
Yes, on the roof to see the sunset.

15:51.226 --> 15:52.588
So it has to be 1745.

15:52.668 --> 15:54.850
So when we see the sunset, we've got to be there at 1745.

15:54.870 --> 15:55.311
That's correct.

15:55.371 --> 15:56.552
So we've got to leave here.

15:56.572 --> 15:59.055
We might leave here at 1630.

15:59.075 --> 16:01.257
Because I'm going to take you over to the Green Bay.

16:01.918 --> 16:03.659
Yeah, they've got to get the stars first.

16:03.679 --> 16:05.682
So I have to have the turf at 1750.

16:05.702 --> 16:06.162
No, but...

16:07.610 --> 16:08.231
1630.

16:08.652 --> 16:09.193
Okay, right.

16:09.213 --> 16:10.114
And I'm going to leave you.

16:10.134 --> 16:10.675
I'm going to fly back.

16:10.695 --> 16:11.937
I'm going to take Ferguson out.

16:11.957 --> 16:17.506
So you're going to have him for a while because I'm going to take Ferguson.

16:17.526 --> 16:22.374
Why don't you all ground your stuff back in there and the empty boxes.

16:22.394 --> 16:24.097
Okay, you got them going?

16:24.297 --> 16:34.073
We're going to want you to grab about five to ten of these empty boxes in here.

16:34.390 --> 16:49.784
In here, you have a whole bunch of paperbacks.

16:50.885 --> 17:03.216
Here, if you look at it, you can probably see is

17:04.175 --> 17:05.257
That's a great quote.

17:05.277 --> 17:06.258
History and military.

17:06.278 --> 17:07.180
Peter the Great Quote.

17:07.260 --> 17:08.542
Oh, yeah, Robert Massey.

17:08.562 --> 17:09.704
Robert Massey.

17:10.325 --> 17:11.567
I think one of people was surprised.

17:12.047 --> 17:14.411
The last Lionel I went, Manchester is terrific.

17:14.431 --> 17:15.513
So is Manchester.

17:15.693 --> 17:16.915
Here's another Manchester one.

17:17.175 --> 17:17.816
Robert Tuckman.

17:17.837 --> 17:19.860
What's the other Manchester one?

17:19.880 --> 17:21.302
Gore and the Dream.

17:21.322 --> 17:22.744
Yeah, that's it.

17:22.804 --> 17:25.669
I don't know if you're familiar with the West Point history series, Civil War.

17:25.949 --> 17:26.230
No.

17:26.250 --> 17:27.131
Oh, these are magnificent.

17:27.171 --> 17:29.375
Let me show you this.

17:29.395 --> 17:30.897
Actually, that's not what I'm looking for.

17:30.957 --> 17:31.498
I'm looking forward.

17:33.048 --> 17:33.809
This down here.

17:34.510 --> 17:35.572
This is the West Point series.

17:35.652 --> 17:39.017
Every cadet at West Point has issued a complete set of battle maps.

17:39.578 --> 17:43.304
This one here is the American War, so 1900 to 1953.

17:43.364 --> 17:49.995
And these are magnificently done.

17:50.015 --> 17:52.058
These are incredible study materials.

17:52.078 --> 17:53.140
So here we have World War II.

17:53.160 --> 17:56.144
It goes through and shows by zone.

17:57.066 --> 18:00.912
It explains all the different symbol of the unit.

18:01.195 --> 18:03.317
Markings, what we call operational terms and graphics.

18:03.838 --> 18:04.779
And then you have maps.

18:07.022 --> 18:12.108
And then it explains and depicts the development of the areas of concentration in battle.

18:12.468 --> 18:17.914
So for example, in here, we could go to Germany.

18:19.336 --> 18:20.637
Here's March 1945.

18:20.697 --> 18:22.259
And I can actually show you the units.

18:22.279 --> 18:23.761
Here's Bradley.

18:23.781 --> 18:29.127
And Bradley's, not Bradley, I'm sorry, Patton, Patton's Third Army,

18:30.035 --> 18:30.776
You can see it here.

18:30.796 --> 18:38.166
It's basically on its drive to where they ended up, which was not far from Passau and Pilsen, encircling the river.

18:38.306 --> 18:38.847
Those are amazing.

18:39.148 --> 18:40.369
These are tremendous.

18:40.509 --> 18:43.794
That must be in multiple volumes, right?

18:44.295 --> 18:48.120
Each cadet gets, I'd say, probably about 20 volumes of these.

18:48.140 --> 18:48.340
Really?

18:48.360 --> 18:50.363
And believe it or not, remember this.

18:51.484 --> 18:55.590
On graduation day, every year in West Point, there's two things cadets throw away.

18:56.491 --> 18:59.215
All their uniforms, they just take them and dump them in the dumpsters.

18:59.836 --> 19:08.206
And so every graduation day, all the kids of the faculty and so on that live on post, they know that the cadets are throwing all their old uniforms away, which are, of course, gorgeous uniforms.

19:08.767 --> 19:11.991
The cadet just wants to be done with it.

19:12.051 --> 19:19.761
So they do the dumpster diving adventures, and they go out and they try to salvage hats and shakos.

19:19.821 --> 19:23.005
The other thing cadets throw away is their books.

19:23.886 --> 19:25.388
And on graduation day, you'll find

19:26.077 --> 19:28.419
Hundreds of these, and they're gorgeous.

19:28.440 --> 19:29.801
They're incredible to be throwing away.

19:29.821 --> 19:30.582
They're quite expensive, too.

19:30.602 --> 19:36.088
But the cadets dump it, you know, because they want to be done with it and clear all their stuff off and move on.

19:37.229 --> 19:43.476
You can see we've got some of the Bruce Patton, Bruce Catton, Civil War, beautiful, nice copy of Brains and I'm Wasp.

19:43.496 --> 19:44.657
Oh, yeah, the Library of America.

19:45.077 --> 19:50.843
I thought this was an interesting little piece on Waterloo, and I don't know where it came from.

19:50.863 --> 19:52.405
I don't know who created it.

19:53.870 --> 20:00.238
Colonel Nickerson, but it doesn't have any publication information.

20:01.660 --> 20:07.368
So just a lot of... I'll make some military history.

20:07.388 --> 20:22.628
At first, I was not pulling out paperback histories, but there's so many relevant military paperbacks here that I think soldiers would be good to read that I actually went back and I tried to pull as many of those and save them as I could.

20:23.249 --> 20:27.196
A lot of these are books that most officers read.

20:27.657 --> 20:31.304
Up there behind your head we have The Killer Angels by Michael Scherer.

20:31.344 --> 20:37.174
That has been mandatory reading for all officers going through Command and General Staff College.

20:38.136 --> 20:42.804
Virtually any officer in the Army of the rank of major and above almost certainly has read that book.

20:43.145 --> 20:47.653
It's a cultural fixation of the military life today.

20:48.494 --> 20:56.286
Similarly, you know, the Bruce Catton paperback series is something that I think a lot of Army officers would read.

20:56.306 --> 20:59.771
So I tried to find things that are professionally relevant.

20:59.891 --> 21:04.558
I mean, it's not a sophisticated library, but it's a whole lot more than what we had a month ago.

21:04.679 --> 21:05.099
Oh, sure.

21:05.800 --> 21:06.021
Yeah.

21:06.742 --> 21:07.763
Battle Cry of Freedom.

21:08.524 --> 21:10.868
Here I started separating military biographies.

21:10.968 --> 21:16.797
General's Life by Bradley, General Patton's Soldier's Life by Hirshon, Colin Powell's book.

21:17.114 --> 21:18.536
Wesley Clark.

21:18.856 --> 21:20.357
Tom Brokaw's Greatest Generation.

21:20.878 --> 21:24.622
This, in fact, is one of my favorite books on war.

21:25.423 --> 21:36.274
When I was at West Point, I often was asked by cadets, sir, can you give me a reading list of the books that we absolutely have to read to be an educated soldier?

21:37.135 --> 21:39.318
I said, well, the list has got to be short.

21:39.338 --> 21:43.442
It's got to be not more than 10 books, because otherwise, it'll just be a list.

21:43.827 --> 21:48.413
It's got to be an achievable list that the average lieutenant can handle.

21:48.433 --> 21:55.923
And so I tried to come up with a list of about the ten books that I thought, you know, if you read these, they were probably fairly well prepared for war.

21:56.464 --> 21:57.185
This is one of them.

21:57.626 --> 21:58.086
And that is?

21:58.527 --> 21:59.629
With the Old Breed by E.B.

21:59.649 --> 22:02.593
Sludger, Marine and the Island Hopping Campaigns of World War II.

22:03.414 --> 22:06.338
And, you know, I read an awful lot on Vietnam.

22:06.458 --> 22:07.860
And Vietnam had its moments.

22:08.701 --> 22:09.382
It's horrors.

22:09.482 --> 22:13.227
Khe Sanh and Iodrain.

22:13.561 --> 22:15.443
LZX-Ray in 1965.

22:16.544 --> 22:28.877
But you read a book like this, and you read about men that are trapped in a small island space, when an enemy is determined to kill him, and you're trapped on that island, your buddy dies, and your fox is with you, and his corpse lays there with you, there's nowhere to go.

22:28.897 --> 22:32.120
I mean, it's close combat of the most gruesome sort.

22:33.021 --> 22:38.387
This is a valuable tool for soldiers, for officers.

22:38.789 --> 22:41.992
because it's an unromantic depiction of what war is all about.

22:42.613 --> 22:47.378
So you're happy, needless to say, ecstatic, to get a copy of that book, right?

22:47.418 --> 22:48.740
Yeah, I'm happy to have that book there.

22:48.760 --> 23:03.475
I mean, some of the other books I told the cadets about on the list, Tim O'Brien's Things They Carried, even though it's a work of fiction, it's a tremendous testament to the life of a soldier, an American soldier in Vietnam in a moment in time.

23:03.535 --> 23:05.157
So let me ask you a question.

23:05.197 --> 23:07.159
So you were thrilled that somebody donated that?

23:07.510 --> 23:10.132
Yeah, I mean, it was a great contribution to the library.

23:10.152 --> 23:12.334
Do you have funds to go out and buy books?

23:12.354 --> 23:13.635
No, I do not have funds.

23:14.336 --> 23:27.628
And in fact, some of the particulars of this library, when I originally started this project, I had to go through my Army staff judge advocate and see if it was legal for us to accept books.

23:28.188 --> 23:31.971
And there were actually conditions under which we could accept the books.

23:32.852 --> 23:36.015
One was it had to be unsolicited.

23:36.299 --> 23:51.404
So because the veterans offered to help, and they took the initiative in offering to help us here, then I think we can say safely and honestly that it was their initiative.

23:52.506 --> 23:53.368
That's one function.

23:54.069 --> 24:00.079
The fact that we're in a war zone meant, and under combat theater rules,

24:00.700 --> 24:06.387
In Germany, if we'd received these donations, all these hardbound books would have to become accountable properly within the army supply system.

24:07.528 --> 24:08.830
I mean, that's a nightmare.

24:08.850 --> 24:19.783
So, in essence, it becomes disadvantageous to accept books because you take on this massive accountability requirement.

24:20.504 --> 24:27.332
By being here in combat and by intending the ultimate disposition to go to Iraqis, which was my intent from the very beginning,

24:28.173 --> 24:31.136
This is not something that is designed to become part of the U.S.

24:31.156 --> 24:32.397
Army accountability system.

24:33.278 --> 24:34.960
This really is a transit library.

24:35.080 --> 24:40.686
This is a temporary home until they eventually move into the hands of Iraqis.

24:43.068 --> 24:45.350
And where do you think they're available?

24:45.751 --> 24:54.179
I think that a lot of these books will end up in the town of Balad, right near here, B-A-L-A-D, which is the nearest town to El San Anaconda.

24:55.180 --> 24:57.943
And I don't think all of them will, but...

24:58.463 --> 25:01.749
My intent is to donate them in small groups at a time.

25:01.769 --> 25:07.941
In other words, let them come and tell me what they want first and let them have those.

25:09.704 --> 25:20.404
Rather than arrive at their doorstep, let's say, in the town of Balad with 10,000 books, I'd rather feed them small quantities of 100 to 300 to 400 books

25:21.059 --> 25:24.123
and let them absorb them first and get a sense of what they're looking at.

25:24.143 --> 25:26.706
Because they're not native English speakers.

25:26.786 --> 25:33.014
They don't have the sensibility of knowing what the different books are the way we do.

25:33.034 --> 25:35.297
So they have to kind of de-samiliarize.

25:35.337 --> 25:38.000
You'd have to say it's a mixed bag with what you've got, right?

25:38.260 --> 25:39.141
It is a mixed bag.

25:39.642 --> 25:40.443
It is a mixed bag.

25:40.503 --> 25:48.653
And at the same time, I'm very pleased with how much is here that I think will find use.

25:49.004 --> 25:51.026
either by the soldiers or among the Iraqis.

25:52.768 --> 26:03.278
For example, I don't think soldiers are going to have much use probably for the Reader's Digest books, and there's a lot of them, but I think that the Iraqis almost certainly will.

26:04.019 --> 26:11.446
So there, you kind of look at the trade-offs between the two different reading publics, and I think in the end, we come out pretty good.

26:13.168 --> 26:17.712
But yeah, there's a percentage, I think, that, and I'd probably say that

26:18.046 --> 26:25.194
probably 10% of what we've got is probably not going to be used or is possibly discarded, maybe more than that.

26:25.655 --> 26:30.160
Originally, I had told them only to send hardbacks, and generally they did.

26:30.220 --> 26:46.399
They only sent hardbacks, and that was probably the only criteria I gave them, except I also told them don't send large quantities of magazines, because magazines are very heavy, so they eat up a lot of weight space on the aircraft,

26:47.003 --> 26:50.568
But I did tell them that we would take National Geographic.

26:50.588 --> 27:09.297
And the reason being is if we think about this as an opportunity to share American or Western culture with Iran, which I think it is in part, then what vision of that culture do we want to donate?

27:10.539 --> 27:13.804
And I think National Geographic

27:14.206 --> 27:15.087
is a magazine.

27:15.127 --> 27:17.610
First of all, it's pictorial, so they have imagery.

27:18.030 --> 27:20.193
So it inherently has a context.

27:20.233 --> 27:27.040
So even to an Arabic reader that doesn't speak English, they already know what the article's about because they can see the theme in the photos.

27:28.322 --> 27:30.104
And it's very good quality photography.

27:30.124 --> 27:31.045
It's exceptionally good quality.

27:31.225 --> 27:35.369
And the writing, I think, tends to be national geographic, tends to do very good work.

27:36.110 --> 27:38.052
And it's international in flavor.

27:40.335 --> 27:42.357
I saw when I was putting these up here the other day,

27:42.623 --> 27:46.788
This edition right here of the National Geographic is women of Arabia.

27:46.808 --> 27:47.209
I mean, perfect.

27:47.229 --> 27:47.930
That's perfect.

27:47.950 --> 27:48.230
You know?

27:49.231 --> 27:50.773
I have not sat down and read.

27:50.793 --> 27:53.016
I mean, that woman right there could be in Balad Iraq.

27:53.216 --> 27:54.098
Yeah.

27:54.118 --> 27:55.539
Let me see the covers we get today on it.

27:56.360 --> 27:57.041
October 1987.

27:57.342 --> 28:05.492
So I would guess that the Arabic world was a little different in 1987, almost 20 years ago.

28:07.227 --> 28:13.995
So I did tell them that we would take National Geographic in particular among periodontists.

28:14.175 --> 28:17.659
Did we bring my shawls in or did we leave them in the car?

28:17.899 --> 28:25.709
Curtis took them because he's going to put them in the office.

28:25.749 --> 28:26.309
Terrific.

28:26.590 --> 28:35.580
I've been moving very slow because I've been doing this

28:36.488 --> 28:46.096
The next thing, all these over here, these have got to be alphabetized.

28:46.116 --> 28:52.682
And these three shelves here are essentially women's robberies.

28:52.702 --> 28:58.026
Some of these are already, you can see, some of them are already there.

28:58.046 --> 29:06.073
So we've got to basically get them on there, get the space, and they go back and kind of alphabetize them.

29:08.078 --> 29:14.247
But you want, you just want these to be appetites, these three to be like your own?

29:14.267 --> 29:15.590
Yeah, those are all romance novels.

29:15.610 --> 29:17.593
All the page backs down below can come out.

29:18.614 --> 29:18.714
Okay.

29:18.734 --> 29:20.317
But what about these over here?

29:20.337 --> 29:21.258
No, those are all staged.

29:21.278 --> 29:23.061
Those are already been put up.

29:23.081 --> 29:27.247
Those are like mass, those are bestsellers.

29:27.267 --> 29:31.915
If you look at like Robert Lovellum, this is all W.P.

29:31.935 --> 29:33.377
Griffin, all John Gershaw.

29:34.899 --> 29:35.520
And this side too?

29:37.154 --> 29:38.195
Let's do that other stuff.

29:38.215 --> 29:40.377
Yeah, once we're done with that, we'll build this.

29:40.437 --> 29:41.738
This is going to be a reference library.

29:41.758 --> 29:42.979
Like here, you've got dictionaries.

29:42.999 --> 29:44.160
It's like a reference.

29:44.220 --> 29:50.606
So I'm going to want writer's books on this shelf and this shelf with the computer stuff.

29:50.986 --> 29:52.868
These two will be reference.

29:52.988 --> 29:54.129
These two will be biographies.

29:54.630 --> 29:55.731
And all of these are biographies.

29:56.411 --> 29:59.534
So it's just a matter of alphabetizing and getting in an easy word.

29:59.554 --> 30:02.877
And then the bottom shelf, I think, will be textbooks.

30:03.117 --> 30:05.019
Like all these here are like physics books.

30:05.039 --> 30:05.119
Yes.

30:06.331 --> 30:07.913
Mary Ann's court is over here.

30:08.133 --> 30:25.538
Anyway, if you see something you want to read, if you see something that you think looks appealing, grab it, seriously, we still got to figure out how to read the ceremony more.

30:25.558 --> 30:28.081
I don't know.

30:28.101 --> 30:29.503
Okay, anyway, I think.

30:37.246 --> 30:42.874
I don't want the flash right now.

30:42.954 --> 30:47.480
Did you get what you needed to say?

30:47.500 --> 30:47.680
Yeah.

30:47.700 --> 30:48.441
I'm thinking.

30:49.883 --> 30:51.265
At what point will you start?

30:51.725 --> 30:52.647
Well, wait a minute.

30:52.667 --> 30:54.629
I've got to have a little bit of packing.

30:54.709 --> 30:56.432
Giving books to the Iraqis, do you think?

30:57.033 --> 31:06.325
My hope is actually that I'll donate the very first book here tomorrow.

31:08.363 --> 31:27.544
And if I can get them to take a handful of books with them, one box of books, as a symbolic gesture tomorrow, and then I hope to go down to the blog in early April.

31:27.564 --> 31:38.235
And so if tomorrow Mr. Maytham can indicate what he thinks would be the kinds of books they would want first, then I'll start donating almost immediately.

31:38.654 --> 31:42.278
Because I've got to make room for the other 600 boxes.

31:42.298 --> 31:50.649
You've got Roby here, and you want me to take all these brown boxes and move them around the back so they're on that side, and then start filling in Charles's books, or what do you want me to do?

31:50.669 --> 31:51.650
Well, no, I think, yeah.

31:51.690 --> 31:52.371
That's an isolator.

31:52.391 --> 31:53.252
That's what we're going to do.

31:53.712 --> 31:54.694
Yeah, true.

31:54.714 --> 31:55.795
That's an isolator.

31:55.995 --> 31:56.756
Looks like.

31:56.776 --> 31:58.458
We can put the green digest there.

31:58.478 --> 31:58.899
There you go.

31:58.979 --> 32:00.380
At least it would look pretty.

32:00.501 --> 32:01.362
It would look pretty.

32:01.382 --> 32:04.225
So we'll take all these boxes, me and Roby, and move them out here.

32:04.245 --> 32:07.429
What I was going to do, I was going to finish packing this box here off those.

32:07.898 --> 32:14.767
And then you get another empty box, get all the paperbacks that are here out, then we can move the table to the other room where we have them.

32:16.589 --> 32:18.011
Okay.

32:18.031 --> 32:19.153
Are we present?

32:19.273 --> 32:20.214
I put some water in there.

32:20.234 --> 32:21.135
It's her fault.

32:21.155 --> 32:23.859
Yeah, okay.

32:23.999 --> 32:25.381
Okay.

32:25.461 --> 32:37.517
So, then we move the table, one table here, these three tables are going to form a semicircle where you put like water or whatever in there and put them on.

32:40.012 --> 32:42.896
You can take this off.

32:42.936 --> 32:43.777
Yeah, I could.

32:43.997 --> 32:47.341
I want to throw it off.

32:47.781 --> 32:50.104
Just the box, not the box.

32:50.124 --> 32:52.147
Do you have any empty boxes?

32:52.167 --> 32:53.028
Yeah.

32:53.048 --> 32:54.990
I don't think of empty boxes right here.

32:55.010 --> 32:57.734
Do you have to use your library for it?

32:58.014 --> 32:58.214
Yeah.

32:58.234 --> 32:58.515
You got more?

32:58.535 --> 32:59.396
I do, yeah.

32:59.536 --> 33:00.477
Here's two great books here.

33:00.497 --> 33:02.099
These in the record room.

33:02.179 --> 33:07.926
Back right behind you, by the way, you can, I figured out they're handed over to China specialists.

33:07.946 --> 33:08.787
These books are from China.

33:09.290 --> 33:09.771
Which ones?

33:11.092 --> 33:15.718
Basically, it's right behind these books here, you know, Mao and China, the Chinese.

33:15.959 --> 33:23.628
So when you consider that you had a lot of these old World War II veterans, I mean, many of them are World War II veterans.

33:23.648 --> 33:25.931
In fact, that's what they are, because they're the guys that packed the books.

33:27.093 --> 33:28.895
You could see the kinds of things that they would read.

33:29.075 --> 33:32.259
And there are some books I was going to ask you about.

33:32.279 --> 33:33.761
Just some books that I have.

33:34.702 --> 33:38.267
For example, a certain...

33:38.770 --> 33:43.197
generation of military novels that never made it big.

33:47.944 --> 33:52.952
Here we got The Thin Red Line.

33:53.293 --> 33:56.398
There's another novel from World War II, The Night of the Tiger.

33:57.379 --> 33:59.482
He's probably never sold very well.

34:00.804 --> 34:02.767
He was a Marine in World War II.

34:02.788 --> 34:05.672
He decided to fictionalize his experiences after the war.

34:06.260 --> 34:10.205
Now you see it, this might have been a pretty interesting first edition.

34:10.666 --> 34:13.890
Oh, it's a nice sleeve.

34:13.910 --> 34:14.912
It's a great jacket, huh?

34:15.172 --> 34:15.953
Yeah.

34:16.113 --> 34:18.016
Melvin Voorhees, Show Me a Hero.

34:19.298 --> 34:19.698
1954.

34:19.778 --> 34:29.672
I mean, you'll have to imagine there's not a lot of copies of those out there floating around.

34:29.712 --> 34:31.975
So when somebody borrows it, we're going to sign it out.

34:32.075 --> 34:33.757
We're going to sign it out.

34:33.777 --> 34:33.878
Yeah.

34:33.898 --> 34:34.258
And that's...

34:34.998 --> 34:43.590
Really, that's one of the decisions I had to make early on and figure out how else we'd do it.

34:43.610 --> 34:46.774
Those are all children's books.

34:46.814 --> 34:49.558
In fact, those might be the first books I get to the rack.

34:49.918 --> 34:52.282
It's children's books, kind of.

34:53.784 --> 34:55.987
Two boxes of children's books?

34:56.087 --> 34:57.168
Yeah, two boxes of children's books.

34:57.228 --> 34:59.351
When I say children's books... Why don't you mean picture books?

34:59.932 --> 35:01.715
Well, I got Harry Potter.

35:03.077 --> 35:04.178
But I also have...

35:04.630 --> 35:07.373
You know, somebody might want to read that here.

35:07.393 --> 35:08.154
Huckleberry Finn?

35:08.414 --> 35:10.096
Yeah, well, that's not a children's book.

35:10.116 --> 35:12.358
Well, but it's a little... Yeah.

35:12.758 --> 35:14.921
What's that Jan Carroll thing there, Jan?

35:15.001 --> 35:18.364
Jan Carroll is, you know... I know who she is.

35:18.444 --> 35:18.885
What's that?

35:18.905 --> 35:20.647
The Trellis and the Seed.

35:20.667 --> 35:25.852
And it says, a book for encouragement for all ages.

35:25.872 --> 35:27.153
And essentially, it's like poetry.

35:27.454 --> 35:29.115
I mean, it's dispersed with pictures.

35:29.315 --> 35:30.917
It's a picture book.

35:32.098 --> 35:33.760
And we actually have a pretty good series...

35:34.094 --> 35:45.449
I was going to say we have about 15 of her paperbacks, the adult edition paperbacks over here.

35:46.250 --> 35:52.719
It's funny, when I look at the categories, straight literature is pretty simple, which is a lot of what's behind your head.

35:53.981 --> 35:56.845
But you get a certain category, like, say, social history.

35:56.865 --> 36:00.810
Here we have two studies Turkels.

36:01.803 --> 36:02.724
The Good World War?

36:02.904 --> 36:04.386
Seth Turkel?

36:04.406 --> 36:04.967
Did you make that?

36:04.987 --> 36:05.647
That is, yeah.

36:05.667 --> 36:06.849
I interviewed him when that book came out.

36:06.869 --> 36:07.910
That's a good book.

36:07.990 --> 36:09.532
That was a great book.

36:09.572 --> 36:21.265
Yeah, Seth Turkel is great.

36:21.305 --> 36:28.333
So, um...

36:35.435 --> 36:38.839
So you haven't signed out.

36:41.102 --> 36:42.844
What can the size of the library be?

36:42.964 --> 36:44.667
What are you looking for?

36:44.907 --> 36:50.534
Well, from the very outset, I estimated that we couldn't go more than 10,000 volumes on hand.

36:50.554 --> 36:59.445
And that would be, to go to 10,000, we would have to probably add another third of the number of bookshelves that we have here.

36:59.465 --> 37:04.952
So it would absolutely require the construction of additional shelving

37:05.236 --> 37:07.418
by DPW to absorb that many books.

37:08.579 --> 37:10.861
And that'd be the max.

37:11.502 --> 37:15.946
I think that for this to be functional, it's probably about 5,000 to 8,000 books.

37:16.146 --> 37:17.928
And right now you say it's two or three, you think?

37:18.008 --> 37:20.030
I'll tell you, we have about 3,000.

37:20.050 --> 37:22.072
We had some books that were already here when we got here.

37:22.112 --> 37:24.775
We added about 2,600 volumes.

37:28.278 --> 37:32.442
And we've got more than half the shelf space full already.

37:34.227 --> 37:40.072
I think it's, you know, on the one hand, if you get a lot of stuff, you can be a little bit more selective food from college.

37:40.552 --> 37:40.773
Yeah.

37:41.593 --> 37:45.597
But I don't, you know, my goal at the end of the day is not to destroy books.

37:45.617 --> 37:48.299
That's what I, I don't want to find myself throwing books away.

37:49.420 --> 37:55.565
Which is admirable, but I think you also have to be selective as to what you put out.

37:55.585 --> 37:57.787
What you do is what you do is do it.

37:57.807 --> 37:59.549
You can't just, because somebody gave it to you.

38:00.129 --> 38:00.429
Yeah.

38:01.690 --> 38:03.492
Well, especially because

38:03.742 --> 38:05.885
they're shipping it halfway around the world.

38:06.486 --> 38:09.631
I mean, this stuff is coming from North Carolina in this case.

38:10.872 --> 38:17.903
There's another book drive being started now by the soldiers, the veterans of the 71st Division in South Carolina.

38:18.103 --> 38:20.486
And you'll meet Mickey Dorson, who's the 71st boy.

38:20.506 --> 38:31.943
And I'll be honest, I wouldn't be surprised if some of the other units that I didn't get to talk to last year that will be in reunion ceremonies in Passau, the word of mouth will spread.

38:32.935 --> 38:49.799
And so I will have to play for construction and say, look, we've kind of got all this category, and I'm going to specifically ask you certain kinds of things, like basic primers in English language, teaching kids how to, you know, teaching an Arabic child how to speak English.

38:50.180 --> 38:52.262
I have no idea what kind of book we need to do that.

38:52.983 --> 39:00.394
Fortunately, through a lot of the veterans that are already part of the program and through librarians,

39:00.745 --> 39:04.809
We have connections through, like, the University of North Carolina, the Journalism Department.

39:06.170 --> 39:07.551
That goes out around to the right.

39:07.571 --> 39:09.353
Oh, all that's medical.

39:09.393 --> 39:14.157
Well, that's all got to go to blood in another medical center.

39:14.177 --> 39:15.919
There's also some medical books around the corner.

39:15.939 --> 39:18.621
So, I mean, we want to segregate all the medical materials.

39:19.002 --> 39:19.903
That's very, very heavy.

39:20.763 --> 39:26.769
Yeah, I got it.

39:26.789 --> 39:27.449
Hey.

39:27.530 --> 39:27.810
Look at her.

39:27.870 --> 39:28.150
Look at her.

39:29.832 --> 39:30.212
Hey, how you doing?

39:30.648 --> 39:33.511
We're getting ready.

39:33.851 --> 39:39.276
We're opening in the library tomorrow and making books available for soldiers to check out.

39:39.336 --> 39:41.998
We'll be trying to get it into a condition that's ready.

39:44.821 --> 39:46.642
I don't know.

39:46.823 --> 39:49.545
That's not the one that I got, is it?

39:49.565 --> 39:50.466
It was just sitting out there.

39:51.166 --> 39:51.747
What is this?

39:52.027 --> 39:53.408
That's the one I bought.

39:53.429 --> 39:53.989
It's yours.

39:54.109 --> 39:54.850
Yeah, it's mine.

39:55.490 --> 39:55.630
No.

39:55.651 --> 39:57.172
No, that's not yours.

39:57.192 --> 39:59.154
No, it's not mine.

39:59.194 --> 39:59.674
Hold on.

39:59.794 --> 40:00.655
It's a different one.

40:01.343 --> 40:07.189
Oh, where did that come from?

40:07.209 --> 40:07.810
I got mine right here.

40:07.850 --> 40:09.532
You know about this, right?

40:09.652 --> 40:10.993
Yeah, I found out last night.

40:11.013 --> 40:13.155
Some of these are selling for $80 a day.

40:13.496 --> 40:14.016
It could have been.

40:14.076 --> 40:16.239
I just didn't know.

40:17.900 --> 40:18.441
Is that right?

40:19.382 --> 40:19.622
Why?

40:19.702 --> 40:20.443
Oh, yeah.

40:21.004 --> 40:23.426
Because they're called pods.

40:23.446 --> 40:24.407
Different pods come out.

40:24.427 --> 40:25.388
Hey, Sergeant Smith.

40:25.889 --> 40:26.489
Yes, sir.

40:26.750 --> 40:29.933
Remember when we cleared this thing off, it keeps saying it's cold.

40:31.853 --> 40:32.975
Okay, here.

40:32.995 --> 40:38.985
And I don't know what... Remaining, seriously, remaining zero means it's all.

40:39.746 --> 40:43.592
I tried to record stuff and it keeps saying... See if you can record us talking.

40:44.294 --> 40:45.135
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

40:45.175 --> 40:45.516
Let me erase.

40:45.596 --> 40:46.718
With the pods.

40:46.738 --> 40:47.639
I tried to erase.

40:47.659 --> 40:48.641
I couldn't get it to do anything.

40:48.661 --> 40:49.903
It completely ignored me.

40:49.923 --> 40:51.886
It doesn't follow the instructions.

40:51.906 --> 40:54.651
So, um... I got some soap last night with the PX.

40:54.871 --> 40:55.652
Oh, okay.

40:55.712 --> 40:57.235
See, I was going to ask.

40:57.255 --> 40:57.355
Yeah.

40:57.689 --> 41:02.073
I almost grabbed something and just ran it over to you because I thought, maybe, maybe not.

41:02.093 --> 41:05.497
The kid that drove the bus, the bus drove me over and waited for me and drove me back.

41:05.597 --> 41:08.119
The P.S.

41:08.139 --> 41:11.102
is just down the street.

41:11.122 --> 41:11.923
It's not far.

41:12.303 --> 41:15.006
All the pods have different designs.

41:15.046 --> 41:17.469
Some of the designs were not produced in very large numbers.

41:17.529 --> 41:19.871
It's the basic rule of supply and demand.

41:19.891 --> 41:27.038
If you've got one of those rare pods, and I don't know which ones are hard to find and which ones are not hard to find.

41:27.710 --> 41:33.496
I mean, they're solders, I know, that get on eBay, you know, scouting out, you know, prices.

41:34.998 --> 41:39.262
Yeah, I think that's going to look a lot better for tomorrow, visually, instead of the boxes.

41:40.003 --> 41:42.826
But I do think the boxes are important.

41:42.866 --> 41:43.767
Some, some boxes.

41:43.867 --> 41:44.508
Is it recording?

41:44.568 --> 41:45.169
1-28-17.

41:45.209 --> 41:47.011
Hit record.

41:47.031 --> 41:48.252
It should record.

41:48.272 --> 41:50.594
Is it recording right now?

41:50.614 --> 41:53.337
Well, I have no idea how you got that to work.

41:53.698 --> 41:55.860
What would we do without NCOs, okay?

41:56.498 --> 41:57.580
I have no idea.

41:57.620 --> 42:01.046
Let me think about some of the other things here.

42:02.048 --> 42:05.193
Hey, what else are I, Bailey?

42:05.734 --> 42:06.596
Good.

42:06.616 --> 42:07.938
You want for a book?

42:08.078 --> 42:09.360
I'm just looking right now.

42:09.380 --> 42:13.107
I'm seeing some of my compadres I'm traveling with.

42:13.427 --> 42:15.471
Well, you know what?

42:16.252 --> 42:17.815
Are you going to another farm or are you here?

42:18.385 --> 42:20.608
Oh, I'm from Northern Canada.

42:20.748 --> 42:20.949
Are you?

42:20.969 --> 42:23.332
Why don't you take a box of books with you?

42:23.352 --> 42:24.253
No, I'm serious.

42:24.333 --> 42:25.595
No, we don't have any room.

42:25.695 --> 42:26.657
We've got 114.

42:27.718 --> 42:28.419
We've got a bag.

42:28.519 --> 42:30.402
All these boxes out here are paperbacks.

42:30.422 --> 42:37.953
These ones here are going to be for checkout, but around the corner, all these boxes are paperbacks that are available.

42:38.053 --> 42:41.477
Okay, let me send them out in conference.

42:41.497 --> 42:41.878
These are horrible.

42:47.208 --> 42:48.831
A little bit.

42:48.851 --> 42:50.894
Who made the shelves, too?

42:51.154 --> 42:54.580
DPW, which is Department of, or Director of Physical Works.

42:54.660 --> 42:57.424
DPW, Department of Physical Works.

42:59.608 --> 43:00.449
Department of Public Works.

43:00.830 --> 43:04.155
They made the sign, the memorial sign, and they made the shelves.

43:04.175 --> 43:07.360
And these two NCOs here, the two Bostonian staff sergeants,

43:07.559 --> 43:08.100
We painted?

43:08.300 --> 43:15.488
Basically, they painted this room, and I got pictures of them painting the room, and they painted each other, but there were no public displays of affection.

43:15.788 --> 43:24.918
And they went over to DPW, and they sweet-talked the guys over there and said, hey, we've got this thing.

43:24.958 --> 43:26.420
We really need this right away.

43:26.500 --> 43:27.741
It's really important.

43:28.102 --> 43:30.324
We're going to open this library, and we don't have any shelves.

43:31.325 --> 43:36.351
And we're really going to be in trouble if we open a library without shelves, because we won't have stacks of books.

43:36.787 --> 43:40.913
So they got them to make these shelves very quickly.

43:40.933 --> 43:43.116
I mean, literally, what, in about a week?

43:43.136 --> 43:44.899
Yeah, it usually takes six weeks.

43:44.919 --> 43:45.780
Five days.

43:46.060 --> 43:46.781
Five days.

43:47.482 --> 44:03.385
So, you know, when you think about everybody that has become involved in this in some fashion, and I mean this from veterans, Dr. Rosemus and things that she's done to help kind of tie friends together, the public affairs guys,

44:03.787 --> 44:09.495
The Education Center officer who runs this building, who is currently on R&R back in the States, he won't be here tomorrow.

44:09.955 --> 44:12.499
His boss will be here, Colonel Hampton.

44:12.799 --> 44:16.724
All the different organizations and pieces, it's really amazing, the different problems.

44:16.905 --> 44:20.850
And now the Iraqis and the people that I've met in downtown a lot.

44:20.870 --> 44:23.213
The civil affairs officer who took us in the convoy out there.

44:23.233 --> 44:29.862
And you start to look at what it takes to make something on the surface that looks very simple.

44:30.837 --> 44:35.884
happen and make it so that it can actually be realized is amazing.

44:36.605 --> 44:38.267
It's phenomenal.

44:38.287 --> 44:45.437
You know, I meant to grab it earlier, but there was a James Lee Burke paperback on the table when I first came in and I meant to grab it, but I didn't.

44:45.497 --> 44:51.025
And now you know it's gone.

44:51.045 --> 44:57.153
You know, it's funny, I'm sitting here looking over the back of my shoulder because I haven't had time to sort a lot of this in my mind.

44:57.213 --> 44:59.376
I'm seeing books that I know have to be moved and

44:59.677 --> 45:26.528
uh other categories and and the instinct in me is to constantly cultivate stuff where it belongs oh yeah you're a natural you know what is there a men's room here um i'm gonna shut this up converted mess all right a converted iraqi air force metal

45:28.735 --> 45:49.562
A book that tells you how to fight like Bruce Lee, how to paint like Picasso, how to hit a home run like Babe Ruth, all in one book.

45:51.888 --> 45:53.591
I have to wonder who makes these books.

45:53.631 --> 45:56.677
This is what I mean when I'm talking about books that probably have no value.

45:56.897 --> 45:59.502
Unfortunately, amateurs don't make a dime selling hardwoods.

46:02.147 --> 46:03.349
I hate to throw it away.

46:03.389 --> 46:08.078
The Iraqis basically tell me they have no use for it.

46:08.799 --> 46:15.111
Otherwise, I've got a section on food service management.

46:17.048 --> 46:29.893
Well, I'm starting to think that if you get a lot of books, or you get the books...

46:31.342 --> 46:39.114
Actually, in some of the classics I've seen here, I saw the, what was it called, The Secret Spring, the first book about ecology.

46:39.314 --> 46:40.055
Oh, Silent Spring.

46:40.075 --> 46:40.736
Silent Spring.

46:40.816 --> 46:43.400
There's a copy of that here somewhere in this collection.

46:43.420 --> 46:45.604
And what a fascinating book to end up in this.

46:45.624 --> 46:46.205
Yeah.

46:46.245 --> 46:51.913
Here we have John Huntside, The Centaur.

46:52.915 --> 46:54.037
It is a mix-up.

46:54.057 --> 46:56.861
This book I talked to you about the other day, Don Lolo's Underworld.

46:56.881 --> 46:57.322
Oh, that too.

46:57.342 --> 46:58.243
And a nice hard book.

46:58.679 --> 47:02.686
The first 50 to 100 pages are probably arguably some of the best writing on baseball.

47:02.706 --> 47:04.669
Is that the copy you rented it?

47:04.689 --> 47:06.132
Is it what?

47:06.152 --> 47:07.614
Is that the copy you rented that in?

47:07.694 --> 47:08.135
No, no, no.

47:08.336 --> 47:09.177
That was here in the lives.

47:09.197 --> 47:12.823
I mean, I had my own copy back at home that's autographed.

47:13.084 --> 47:13.965
I did get DeLuel's.

47:13.985 --> 47:17.391
You know, I think DeLuel should have gotten the Pulitzer.

47:18.012 --> 47:19.094
I think so.

47:19.394 --> 47:20.316
Of course, the Pulitzer's.

47:20.650 --> 47:25.397
Oh, that was quite controversial when he gave it to a total unknown.

47:25.417 --> 47:28.743
Well, there's a lot of people that don't like that, that didn't like Underworld.

47:28.823 --> 47:31.206
In fact, a lot of people said that it's impossible to finish.

47:32.649 --> 47:38.918
I have to agree to the extent that I can say that I've started, I've read the first 100 pages five times.

47:38.938 --> 47:42.123
So I've read the number of pages in the book, but I haven't read the book.

47:43.005 --> 47:45.188
I think I got probably halfway through.

47:47.572 --> 47:49.054
There's a Jim Caron there.

47:51.312 --> 47:53.414
See, this course is not alphabetized yet.

47:53.875 --> 48:02.364
Ragtime by Yale Doctora, great book.

48:02.524 --> 48:04.866
Tales of Old Henry.

48:04.887 --> 48:08.450
Let me put this marcuso over here.

48:09.491 --> 48:20.323
There's a lot of harlican romances over there.

48:21.063 --> 48:23.105
All right.

48:25.708 --> 48:27.069
Where's the women's interest section?

48:27.810 --> 48:30.192
What do you mean by women's interest?

48:30.212 --> 48:32.635
Paperback, women's interest.

48:32.715 --> 48:33.776
I have some of those big novels.

48:33.876 --> 48:35.858
It's part with all the Harlequins.

48:35.878 --> 48:37.580
We're not keeping those.

48:37.600 --> 48:37.660
No.

48:37.680 --> 48:39.121
But I don't know where we're going.

48:39.141 --> 48:41.604
We've got to find somebody that wants them.

48:41.624 --> 48:41.944
Got it.

48:41.964 --> 48:46.429
I don't think we're going to do those to a rag.

48:46.449 --> 48:47.390
It's a hard call.

48:47.470 --> 48:48.371
Driving Mr. Albert.

48:48.771 --> 48:50.833
A trip across America with Einstein's brain.

48:51.320 --> 48:53.082
See, I think this is literature.

48:53.142 --> 48:54.484
This is something we want to keep.

48:54.504 --> 48:55.465
I know, but I'm looking.

48:55.585 --> 48:56.346
These are new books.

48:57.027 --> 48:58.068
Tell me what's next we got.

48:58.088 --> 49:01.912
This is the series... Where's the light seat?

49:01.932 --> 49:03.554
Not anywhere near where I'm standing.

49:03.634 --> 49:05.537
No, that's over here.

49:05.557 --> 49:06.097
That's over here.

49:06.197 --> 49:07.599
Oh, here we go.

49:07.639 --> 49:08.921
How to remodel a man.

49:09.061 --> 49:10.082
There you go.

49:10.242 --> 49:12.785
Which man do you want to remodel?

49:12.925 --> 49:16.750
Listen, I'm coping with difficult people for not Major Karnes' death overboard.

49:16.990 --> 49:19.013
Oh, all right.

49:19.033 --> 49:19.453
Um...

49:20.125 --> 49:22.527
Social, social.

49:23.448 --> 49:23.929
Yeah.

49:23.969 --> 49:24.469
See this?

49:24.730 --> 49:28.073
Here's military inside Delta Force and the Art of War.

49:28.093 --> 49:28.593
Oh, yeah.

49:28.613 --> 49:29.234
The Art of War.

49:30.916 --> 49:33.478
Smithsonian History of Warfare.

49:33.939 --> 49:37.422
This is part of that series I told you about, the calc that the Army sends out.

49:37.442 --> 49:39.684
This is actually Army volume.

49:39.704 --> 49:40.565
This is very good.

49:40.605 --> 49:42.287
Inside Delta Force, very relevant.

49:43.188 --> 49:45.390
And obviously, when I sort the military out,

49:46.265 --> 49:48.589
I've got to figure out how to divide this up.

49:48.609 --> 49:52.035
And I'm reluctant to do so to target the other two shipments.

49:52.335 --> 50:00.509
And once I know, I assume this whole section here, at least, is going to be military history and history.

50:00.909 --> 50:02.211
Okay, I've got to get somebody to the board.

50:03.313 --> 50:04.676
We need to go through this stuff.

50:04.696 --> 50:05.717
Okay, go to the board.

50:05.837 --> 50:07.560
Look at what you have to do.

50:07.941 --> 50:08.322
Yeah.

50:08.342 --> 50:10.685
This is all good since we've kept all of our rights.

50:11.186 --> 50:12.829
This is going postal.

50:13.788 --> 50:17.012
This is just regular books that some people might like.

50:17.052 --> 50:20.397
Paperbacks, yeah, that's all paperbacks.

50:20.417 --> 50:22.960
Just throw them all in the box.

50:23.040 --> 50:24.822
Do you have a section for Nora Roberts?

50:24.902 --> 50:25.223
Do you?

50:25.723 --> 50:26.825
That would be religion.

50:26.845 --> 50:29.128
I had all that Nora Roberts stacked up the paperbacks.

50:29.148 --> 50:30.990
I had like 25 Nora Roberts.

50:31.010 --> 50:31.871
That's all religion?

50:32.772 --> 50:33.914
Yeah, I should love it.

50:34.715 --> 50:35.296
Oral Roberts?

50:35.316 --> 50:36.237
It's Nora.

50:36.257 --> 50:37.619
Why did they say Oral Roberts?

50:37.659 --> 50:38.380
Nora Roberts.

50:38.400 --> 50:40.943
Yeah, Nora Roberts is...

50:41.885 --> 50:43.226
I don't know who she is.

50:43.367 --> 50:44.808
It's kind of like women's romance.

50:44.828 --> 50:46.470
Very, very popular than it.

50:46.490 --> 50:49.634
How about this, the burglar who liked to quote Kipley?

50:49.654 --> 50:50.094
I don't know.

50:50.154 --> 50:52.136
Who's the author?

50:52.156 --> 50:53.918
Union Times, Lawrence Block.

50:53.938 --> 50:54.679
Oh, yeah?

50:54.699 --> 50:55.200
It's a mystery.

50:55.500 --> 50:57.923
He was going to say, he's a mystery writer, kind of like Sanders.

50:58.583 --> 51:03.469
How to Live Cooler, Smarter, Faster, Better.

51:03.629 --> 51:04.490
Yeah, that's good.

51:04.710 --> 51:07.273
Several of them, yeah.

51:07.293 --> 51:08.454
The tattooed soldier.

51:08.634 --> 51:11.858
See, I think these soldiers

51:12.108 --> 51:15.972
These are mailed as a box.

51:15.992 --> 51:19.936
These are pretty interesting.

51:19.956 --> 51:22.138
At home, the heart of Appalachia, straight to the universe.

51:22.779 --> 51:25.041
I mean, this is just a mix.

51:25.061 --> 51:27.524
It's a medalist.

51:27.544 --> 51:41.018
But in a way, see, this does do, this is the Army actually its own program doing not what we're trying to do, but there's, this is a good box of mixed

51:41.926 --> 51:44.830
appetites to ship out the soldiers on a file.

51:47.513 --> 51:49.897
See, because when people ask me, what do you want?

51:51.038 --> 51:55.344
The problem with that question is, I don't know because I don't know what my readers want.

51:55.504 --> 51:56.585
I don't know what my readers want.

51:56.626 --> 52:02.553
They're talking about a particular kind of audience, and I'm trying to guess what soldiers read.

52:02.573 --> 52:11.325
They read, I mean, particularly an army in Iraq that reads that it's both an active army

52:11.828 --> 52:18.697
And a National Guard Reserve Army means you've got tapes from all over the country, all walks of life.

52:18.837 --> 52:25.686
And that's why I say we need a library that reflects the diversity of the normal American library.

52:25.946 --> 52:30.192
So the question for me became, how are libraries organizing?

52:30.212 --> 52:34.437
Here I am, a man with no library training, per se.

52:35.198 --> 52:38.863
And so when I first thought of this, I said, how do I know how to build a library?

52:38.943 --> 52:40.705
Where do I go to learn how to build a library?

52:41.140 --> 52:43.243
So what I did was, I did several things.

52:43.424 --> 52:54.200
First, I contacted the librarian at the Heidelberg Resource Library in Heidelberg, Military Library, Meg Tolick, who is a graduate of the University of Texas Library Science Program.

52:54.701 --> 52:56.965
And I said, Meg, I'm sitting in a rock.

52:56.985 --> 52:58.467
I think I'm going to end up with a whole bunch of books.

52:58.567 --> 53:01.792
I don't know what kind, but I want to know how to organize these books.

53:02.052 --> 53:02.934
What do I do with them?

53:02.994 --> 53:03.875
How do I put them in some kind?

53:04.817 --> 53:05.418
What do I do?

53:05.718 --> 53:06.359
How do I do it?

53:06.920 --> 53:08.623
So I literally had to start from zero.

53:08.643 --> 53:09.544
What was she saying?

53:09.727 --> 53:14.131
Well, she said, I'll give you some websites and things to start looking at.

53:14.151 --> 53:15.132
She goes, I'll check around.

53:15.232 --> 53:16.253
I'll see what's out there.

53:16.273 --> 53:18.935
She gave me materials on some Army programs.

53:19.415 --> 53:20.837
That's why I have these.

53:20.857 --> 53:23.139
She shipped me these, actually.

53:25.400 --> 53:27.642
We talked about to catalog or not to catalog.

53:27.662 --> 53:28.543
That's one of the decisions.

53:28.583 --> 53:30.065
There's an online program.

53:30.885 --> 53:35.930
First of all, there's OCLC, of course, which can give you a very quick bibliographic data on every book.

53:35.950 --> 53:38.772
But there's also a program that I can create a database.

53:39.308 --> 53:43.874
But then the problem becomes, I'm sitting in the middle of Iraq.

53:44.175 --> 53:47.600
Getting access to the internet is not a given.

53:47.660 --> 53:49.342
Do we have internet outlets in this room?

53:49.522 --> 53:49.702
No.

53:50.484 --> 53:54.970
To get an internet outlet to this room in Iraq, you start to ask yourself all the hundred questions.

53:55.551 --> 53:58.875
Is it worth it if the intent is to move the books to the Iraqis?

53:59.136 --> 54:02.720
So every question like that led to 10 to 20 other questions.

54:03.121 --> 54:08.168
I also contacted, one of the other things I did right away, is I joined the American Library Association.

54:08.384 --> 54:09.566
I wrote them, and I asked them.

54:10.066 --> 54:12.009
I said, I'm an army officer serving in Iraq.

54:12.530 --> 54:14.032
I'm trying to build a library from scratch.

54:14.573 --> 54:16.296
I need some technical expertise or advice.

54:16.496 --> 54:19.220
Anybody that may have gone through this on their own, can you help me?

54:19.601 --> 54:19.941
Did they?

54:20.902 --> 54:21.543
Not really.

54:21.824 --> 54:24.908
I mean, I didn't pursue it as aggressively as I could have, I think.

54:24.928 --> 54:27.112
I was also getting help from other directions.

54:27.552 --> 54:28.774
I mean, that's why I wrote you.

54:29.155 --> 54:36.265
I was reaching out across a net, and I said, I'm going to hit all these data possibilities, and maybe I'll get some answers back, and maybe I'll get nothing.

54:37.223 --> 54:39.187
And in some cases, I got a whole bunch of help.

54:39.808 --> 54:40.249
Seriously.

54:40.269 --> 54:42.674
I mean, you're sitting here today, really, because of this.

54:43.756 --> 54:49.187
What I did get to the American Library Association, and I intend to follow up, several things came out of that.

54:49.207 --> 54:55.660
Number one, they have a newsletter or news magazine that they published.

54:56.201 --> 54:56.582
They're

54:57.018 --> 54:59.901
The first issue that I received as a member was on military libraries.

55:00.142 --> 55:00.883
No kidding.

55:00.903 --> 55:02.124
I mean, what an irony.

55:02.224 --> 55:03.205
Who would have figured that?

55:03.225 --> 55:06.489
I don't know if they've ever done a military libraries issue before, but I have that.

55:06.529 --> 55:09.953
The very first issue I ever received happened to have been military libraries.

55:10.414 --> 55:11.255
That was one thing I got.

55:11.495 --> 55:17.722
So in that issue, right there, I had contacts in the American Library Association for books about libraries.

55:18.764 --> 55:20.506
Do you need to go back over to the room?

55:20.686 --> 55:21.327
Are you going over?

55:22.308 --> 55:22.748
Yes.

55:22.768 --> 55:25.311
Why don't you go to her, and then you're going to come back when?

55:25.331 --> 55:26.873
I'm going to be back here in an hour and ten minutes.

55:27.038 --> 55:28.039
That would be perfect.

55:28.059 --> 55:28.440
Is that good?

55:28.460 --> 55:28.740
That's good.

55:28.760 --> 55:29.862
Do you think you need a nap?

55:29.882 --> 55:30.163
I do.

55:31.464 --> 55:31.665
Do you?

55:31.705 --> 55:32.406
Do I look like I'm fading?

55:32.526 --> 55:33.047
Yeah.

55:33.067 --> 55:33.608
I am.

55:33.768 --> 55:34.349
It's kicking you up.

55:34.389 --> 55:35.911
But that's okay, because I get more work time.

55:36.432 --> 55:37.413
You go, you take a nap.

55:37.513 --> 55:42.200
How about I come get you... What's going to buy and get you?

55:42.460 --> 55:42.781
About 4.30.

55:42.801 --> 55:43.362
I think two hours.

55:43.382 --> 55:44.984
What's going to buy and get you at about 4.30?

55:45.004 --> 55:46.987
That gives you two hours.

55:47.007 --> 55:47.748
Two hours.

55:47.768 --> 55:48.469
Do you mind?

55:48.669 --> 55:48.870
No.

55:49.030 --> 55:51.173
It's not a problem that...

55:51.625 --> 55:53.467
All of a sudden, I hit the wall.

55:53.487 --> 55:57.391
But tomorrow at this time, we're going to be dead in the middle of the dedication.

55:57.751 --> 55:58.272
That's fine.

55:58.292 --> 55:58.792
Okay.

55:58.812 --> 56:00.634
This is my first full day.

56:01.215 --> 56:02.436
You are hating very, very well.

56:02.736 --> 56:03.557
Why don't you take this?

56:04.198 --> 56:05.899
No, I got one.

56:06.600 --> 56:06.900
Huh?

56:06.920 --> 56:08.602
No, no, you don't have this one.

56:08.622 --> 56:08.982
You sure?

56:10.004 --> 56:10.364
Yeah.

56:10.384 --> 56:10.744
You sure?

56:11.285 --> 56:11.725
I'll take it.

56:11.745 --> 56:12.026
Thanks.

56:12.686 --> 56:14.208
Can you get keys over there, Jesse?

56:14.228 --> 56:14.328
Yeah.

56:17.051 --> 56:18.332
I think I've been doing pretty good.

56:18.512 --> 56:20.434
I think you're doing great.

56:21.157 --> 56:25.982
And I got tape.

56:26.122 --> 56:29.586
And my shawls are in your office, right?

56:29.626 --> 56:30.727
Yeah, yeah.

56:31.287 --> 56:32.609
So we can just leave them there.

56:32.749 --> 56:34.871
So when you come back here, you won't even recognize this building.

56:35.312 --> 56:36.092
I can see it now.

56:36.212 --> 56:39.296
And I got pictures of you guys.

56:39.316 --> 56:42.639
All of a sudden, I just got... You've seen it?

56:42.659 --> 56:44.261
You know what we're working with.

56:44.281 --> 56:46.923
And I know what you're doing.

56:46.943 --> 56:48.745
And I got the interviewer coming back.

56:49.166 --> 56:50.387
And I got a lot of time.

56:50.620 --> 56:53.785
It'll be better if you're resting at night.

56:54.686 --> 56:57.430
You really want to be completely aware of the real visit built-in.

56:58.191 --> 57:03.759
I don't have a phone in the room, right?

57:04.320 --> 57:10.268
I was just going to say, if you want to give me a ring to make sure I'm awake.

57:10.629 --> 57:14.955
We'll come get you and give you 20 minutes to get ready.

57:15.176 --> 57:16.217
Before we go.

57:17.058 --> 57:17.439
I'm good.

57:17.499 --> 57:20.323
I've been doing it for years.

57:21.046 --> 57:28.633
See, look at this edition of the pearl.

57:29.133 --> 57:31.235
I mean, look at that.

57:31.255 --> 57:37.661
Well, we just go in closer to the latest book.

57:37.881 --> 57:41.325
It's a very early phantom.

57:42.946 --> 57:44.107
This could be very valuable.

57:44.428 --> 57:45.008
Really?

57:45.028 --> 57:45.428
Yeah.

57:45.589 --> 57:49.332
Well, it's the second printing, but that's okay.

57:50.071 --> 57:53.855
Put this aside, because Bantams... There's a bunch of stuff that I want to show you.

57:53.875 --> 57:55.116
Bantams are the first paperbacks.

57:58.279 --> 58:01.583
What we're going to do... Did you hear what I said?

58:01.603 --> 58:01.703
Yeah.

58:01.723 --> 58:03.144
Let me just take a look at the condition of it.

58:05.326 --> 58:08.289
Yeah, this is good.

58:08.309 --> 58:11.873
This could be worth like a hundred bucks.

58:11.893 --> 58:12.634
What are you looking at?

58:12.714 --> 58:14.796
You've got to look at the additions here.

58:16.447 --> 58:22.412
I didn't have my tape recording on when I have it, too.

58:22.732 --> 58:28.878
I guarantee there's at least a hundred of these discoveries.

58:28.958 --> 58:35.303
We've got to go through every edition of the... Now open it up very gently.

58:36.204 --> 58:36.564
Two hands.

58:36.644 --> 58:37.685
I'm going to teach you how to do it.

58:40.307 --> 58:41.008
Hold the book in there.

58:41.328 --> 58:42.369
Just frame it like this.

58:42.870 --> 58:45.812
You never want to bring it all the way over like that.

58:46.079 --> 58:50.285
And this is your copyright page, which is very important.

58:50.305 --> 58:53.530
And I just hold it like that so I can get a picture of it.

58:54.070 --> 58:55.232
And I'll tell you about that.

58:55.252 --> 58:56.374
I'll find it when I get home.

58:56.514 --> 58:56.875
You will?

58:57.916 --> 58:58.657
I could even find it.

58:59.859 --> 59:03.003
I could even find it back on AB.

59:03.384 --> 59:05.267
I'll take that back, y'all.

59:05.287 --> 59:10.053
Yeah, well, if I can get on a computer at some point, I'll bring it over there.

59:11.075 --> 59:12.898
And I'll see what it's selling for.

59:13.879 --> 59:16.002
OK.

59:16.454 --> 59:19.999
Those are very collectible.

59:20.019 --> 59:28.052
The first paperbacks are, yeah, because they were... Well, yeah, but it's still very scarce.

59:28.472 --> 59:32.499
It's still 1947.

59:32.519 --> 59:35.924
That's about when the paperback's being invented.

59:35.944 --> 59:36.064
Right.

59:36.084 --> 59:36.405
You know?

59:37.606 --> 59:43.255
I just want to put this in here.

59:45.428 --> 59:47.010
Okay, I need this, right?

59:47.471 --> 59:50.715
Yeah, you do, sir.

59:50.735 --> 59:58.987
I'm going to see if I can still that room inside.

59:59.007 --> 01:00:02.071
Um, where's my helmet?

01:00:02.131 --> 01:00:03.132
Right over there.

01:00:03.733 --> 01:00:04.494
Nope, this is me.

01:00:05.836 --> 01:00:07.518
You already took a picture of this.

01:00:07.538 --> 01:00:10.322
I'm going to take that and go out of your desk.

01:00:13.002 --> 01:00:15.766
Testing, one, two, testing, testing.

01:00:16.808 --> 01:00:18.290
So the automatic reverse on.

01:00:21.575 --> 01:00:22.657
Automatic reverse.

01:00:28.285 --> 01:00:29.928
Checking, checking, checking.

01:00:33.733 --> 01:00:34.294
At the end.

01:00:34.915 --> 01:00:36.057
Getting close to the end.
