WEBVTT

00:02.208 --> 00:06.134
We are talking to Elizabeth Berg and Nadick.

00:08.979 --> 00:11.803
This won't be very—we'll just cover a lot of things, okay?

00:14.067 --> 00:20.077
Some of it, as you saw from that list, is very—well, let's just talk—can you just give me a little biographical background?

00:20.097 --> 00:23.502
Let's start very innocently.

00:23.522 --> 00:24.604
You can tell me a little bit about—

00:24.770 --> 00:25.571
Wow!

00:25.851 --> 00:34.941
You mentioned the fact that you're an army brat, so you've had a peripatetic life, which I'm sure reflects itself on what you've written so far to some degree.

00:34.961 --> 00:39.346
Yeah, particularly in Endurable Goods, which is about an army brat.

00:41.108 --> 00:41.509
That's fine.

00:41.529 --> 00:44.772
I'm just going to put this closer to you, like right there.

00:44.792 --> 00:45.093
Okay?

00:45.713 --> 00:47.695
The closer it is, the better it is for a transcript.

00:47.715 --> 00:48.737
Sure.

00:49.057 --> 00:50.679
So, yeah, that's the deal.

00:50.839 --> 00:54.523
My father was, in fact...

00:54.875 --> 00:59.220
out of the service at the time I was born, which is why I got to be born in Minnesota.

00:59.280 --> 01:04.307
My brother was born in Germany and my sister was born in California.

01:04.667 --> 01:13.879
And then he rejoined, I think I was two or three, and we started moving around like crazy from that time on.

01:13.899 --> 01:23.110
And there were two or three years in which I went to three different schools in that one year.

01:24.558 --> 01:26.440
It was not great.

01:26.560 --> 01:31.724
My father has a whole different perspective on it because he sees it as an opportunity to travel.

01:31.744 --> 01:35.647
And it's true that, you know, I saw Spain and Italy and all that stuff.

01:35.707 --> 01:39.591
But I wanted to be here so that I would know what was on the top ten.

01:39.611 --> 01:43.374
You know, I could care less about going into the catacombs.

01:44.475 --> 01:45.976
I wanted to see the commercials.

01:45.996 --> 01:48.118
I wanted to see what they were wearing and all that stuff.

01:49.119 --> 01:51.361
And so it was sort of lost on me.

01:51.781 --> 01:54.143
And it was very hard to be.

01:54.545 --> 02:04.757
the new girl all the time and not be studying, not having, you know, I was studying something in one school and then I'd come here and they'd be doing Texas history and, you know.

02:04.777 --> 02:07.300
And also knowing that it is impermanent.

02:07.821 --> 02:10.103
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:10.164 --> 02:13.187
With the almost certain knowledge that you're going to be going someplace else.

02:13.207 --> 02:17.312
Yeah, there's something that interests me a lot about

02:17.714 --> 02:45.814
about that kind of growing up in Army Breath, and that is something that I seem to see in all of them, which is that you seem to be gregarious, very friendly, chatty, you can get along with anybody, you can make a conversation with anyone, but you only let people get so far, and then you stop, because it's too painful to open yourself up to people and then leave, and constantly leave, and all those promises about, I'm going to write you early days,

02:46.115 --> 02:58.012
I remember pulling my eyelash out in one new school and writing my best friend and saying, here's my eyelash, I'm going to write you every day for the rest of my life, and you know, last about three weeks.

02:58.032 --> 03:03.600
Just for biographical purposes, can you tell me your father's name, your mother's name?

03:03.800 --> 03:09.609
My father's name is Arthur Peter Hoff, and my mother's name is H-O-S-S.

03:10.490 --> 03:12.713
And my mother's name is...

03:13.267 --> 03:16.391
Yeah, I call him AP.

03:16.411 --> 03:17.433
Okay.

03:17.873 --> 03:22.580
And my mother's name is Marion Jean, she goes by Jean.

03:23.261 --> 03:25.885
J-E-A-M-N-E.

03:27.126 --> 03:28.188
J-E-A-M-N-E.

03:28.208 --> 03:28.488
Okay.

03:28.508 --> 03:30.611
And you were born in St.

03:30.631 --> 03:31.713
Claude, you said?

03:31.873 --> 03:32.414
Yeah.

03:32.434 --> 03:34.277
Was this while your dad was still in the service?

03:34.297 --> 03:39.604
No, he was in, he came out for a while, and then he decided to re-enlist.

03:39.924 --> 03:41.326
So this would be, you said, 46?

03:41.346 --> 03:43.189
48.

03:43.928 --> 03:46.992
I mean, you're 46 years old, so it was about 1948.

03:47.012 --> 03:47.132
Right.

03:47.353 --> 03:49.616
I was born in 48, yeah.

03:49.636 --> 03:49.856
Okay.

03:49.876 --> 03:50.257
Baby boomer.

03:50.637 --> 03:50.998
Yeah.

03:51.118 --> 03:52.199
So to speak.

03:52.280 --> 03:52.520
Yeah.

03:52.540 --> 03:54.342
And your father was in the Army.

03:54.383 --> 03:59.490
I mean, Army Brad is almost an officer, or was it?

03:59.570 --> 04:00.912
Yeah.

04:00.932 --> 04:02.474
Yeah.

04:02.554 --> 04:03.395
Don't you forget.

04:03.435 --> 04:04.637
Yes.

04:04.837 --> 04:07.140
He was a major when he retired.

04:08.082 --> 04:08.823
Uh-huh.

04:09.403 --> 04:11.286
And the truth is, I never...

04:12.025 --> 04:13.968
knew very much about what he did.

04:15.009 --> 04:20.077
It was not a talkative sharing kind of family environment, for one thing.

04:20.738 --> 04:30.332
And he's not much of a talker anyway, but he had different jobs in artillery and intelligence.

04:31.373 --> 04:32.955
His last job was in recruiting.

04:33.837 --> 04:41.728
And he would wear those play army clothes, you know, he'd come home sometimes in critiques and combat boots and all that.

04:42.248 --> 04:46.013
I used to like to unlace the combat, which is very exciting.

04:46.233 --> 04:51.600
He was out of the service when you were born, but then he went back in again?

04:51.620 --> 04:52.541
Yeah.

04:52.661 --> 04:56.005
Was this around Korea or something like that, or why he was growing up?

04:56.706 --> 05:01.613
Well, let's see, he would have re-enlisted around 50 or 51.

05:01.853 --> 05:07.480
I don't know exactly why he did that, except

05:07.932 --> 05:11.658
My sense is that, yes, exactly.

05:11.698 --> 05:13.220
He loved travel.

05:14.262 --> 05:25.239
I think that it offered him a lot of security, particularly since he knew he could be in 20 years and then retire and have pay or whatever it is that happens.

05:25.279 --> 05:28.324
But he liked that life.

05:28.344 --> 05:31.749
And that married folks that still live?

05:32.009 --> 05:32.210
Mm-hmm.

05:32.230 --> 05:35.194
And they obviously are fans of yours.

05:35.274 --> 05:36.336
I'm sure they read your books.

05:36.535 --> 05:46.253
Uh, yeah, yeah, durable books was a hard one for my father because, um, it was, it was loosely autobiographical.

05:46.293 --> 05:48.177
My father was a pretty scary guy, yeah.

05:48.197 --> 05:49.900
You were anticipating a question here, okay.

05:49.920 --> 05:57.514
Yeah, but, so, um, the truth is that when I wrote that manuscript, um, uh,

05:58.051 --> 06:07.985
I had the first, let's see, the first book I ever wrote came about because I've been writing for magazines a lot, including Terrence Magazine.

06:08.005 --> 06:10.228
And this is all stuff that we want, by the way.

06:10.248 --> 06:12.952
Okay, okay, okay, so I won't feel guilty.

06:12.992 --> 06:17.799
No, no, I mean, if you look at your little list, your little... Okay, well, I didn't see the whole thing.

06:18.420 --> 06:20.823
But anyway... I'll show you when we can.

06:20.863 --> 06:21.064
All right.

06:21.084 --> 06:22.386
We'll make sure we do that.

06:22.426 --> 06:23.988
No, because I don't want you thinking about it.

06:24.128 --> 06:27.533
I just, you know, I mean, it's very... No, no, I... You know what I'm saying?

06:27.553 --> 06:27.653
Yeah.

06:27.633 --> 06:30.078
I hate doing interviews.

06:30.138 --> 06:44.626
The truth is that I will try to weasel out of almost any interview that comes up, except this one, because when Sally told me that PW wanted to do an interview, I said, really?

06:44.706 --> 06:49.135
And I was thinking, hmm, PW or PW?

06:49.418 --> 06:53.386
So I wanted to do this one because it's a big deal.

06:53.646 --> 06:56.311
There's a real bonus getting me, by the way, too, I have to say.

06:56.872 --> 06:58.436
I heard good things about you.

06:58.456 --> 07:05.409
But beyond that, I mean, the payoff is that I write for 23 other newspapers in college towns.

07:05.429 --> 07:07.152
Oh, right, yeah, yeah.

07:07.413 --> 07:12.102
But I just heard that you were really, you know, that I wouldn't, they said, oh, you're really going to like him.

07:12.622 --> 07:14.446
And look what a good start we're off to.

07:14.466 --> 07:16.592
We're going to have vodka in a little while.

07:16.812 --> 07:18.556
I've got brownies coming out of the aisle.

07:18.637 --> 07:19.198
I really do.

07:19.278 --> 07:20.722
I got nervous, so I made brownies.

07:21.002 --> 07:29.162
But I hate doing the news because I feel like everything that I want to say publicly is in my books, which is, you know, the old cliche.

07:30.374 --> 07:41.510
moreover, and more importantly, and biggest, I feel when I'm talking about myself that someone behind me is saying, wow, aren't we fascinated with ourselves?

07:41.530 --> 07:43.212
My, my.

07:43.232 --> 07:45.956
And, you know, don't you think you've said, I'm trapped now?

07:46.016 --> 07:47.638
Isn't it the other person's surgery?

07:48.079 --> 07:49.320
You know, all that stuff.

07:49.921 --> 07:54.728
And then, you know, you're going to say something so completely manane that we'll

07:55.113 --> 07:59.700
Let's go back to the first book.

07:59.840 --> 08:01.603
You had done a lot of magazines.

08:02.083 --> 08:03.305
Let's start at the beginning.

08:03.906 --> 08:04.948
So I was a nurse.

08:06.250 --> 08:07.792
And I loved nursing.

08:08.573 --> 08:12.158
But my children were young.

08:12.198 --> 08:15.864
They were about four and nine when I stopped nursing.

08:16.885 --> 08:20.831
And sometimes they would be just a little bit sick.

08:21.312 --> 08:22.774
They weren't sick enough that I would

08:23.277 --> 08:29.947
feel like I had to call in and say I can't come to work, but I would feel terrible leaving them because they would have a little cold and I wanted to be with them.

08:29.967 --> 08:30.848
Where was this, by the way?

08:30.868 --> 08:32.451
That I was a nurse?

08:32.611 --> 08:33.492
Yeah.

08:34.033 --> 08:40.783
Lots of places, including Leonard Morse, well it was Leonard Morse Hospital, which is right at the end of this block.

08:40.863 --> 08:42.225
It's now Metro West.

08:42.305 --> 08:44.569
I worked at Newton Wellesley Hospital.

08:44.769 --> 08:47.713
I did visiting nursing.

08:47.733 --> 08:52.120
I did, at one point I was working in intensive care.

08:52.285 --> 08:54.448
Oh, they're the best people.

08:54.468 --> 08:56.571
They are the best.

08:56.711 --> 08:58.974
If you ever go to the hospital, get in with the nurses.

08:59.014 --> 09:00.115
Forget about the doctors.

09:00.135 --> 09:01.157
Get in with the nurses.

09:01.177 --> 09:20.723
But anyway, so I was doing intensive care and home nursing, and it was a really wonderful contrast to be in the really high-tech area and then see them at home in their own little jammies and with their phones beside them and their children and all their own things, and it was a kind of access that you're not allowed when you're

09:21.293 --> 09:47.790
in the hospital so I loved doing it but I felt badly about leaving my kids oftentimes and then you know you had to work on your birthday you have to work on Christmas you have to work nights you have to work double shifts all that stuff so I had I thought um I thought because um people had always told me from forever you know you're such a good writer you ought to be a writer

09:48.074 --> 09:51.499
And I wrote, you know, letters and I wrote in journals.

09:51.539 --> 09:54.463
Hi, here's Lisa.

09:54.483 --> 09:59.871
I just wanted to get back to you on... I'll call you back.

10:00.932 --> 10:03.696
Anyway, so... Is that a little red light when I write this going?

10:03.756 --> 10:04.037
Yes.

10:04.157 --> 10:06.160
Okay, great.

10:06.180 --> 10:07.942
Yes, it is.

10:08.603 --> 10:13.390
Okay, so... Okay, don't let me forget what I'm... Okay, so...

10:13.724 --> 10:17.449
I said, okay, I know what I'm going to do.

10:17.469 --> 10:18.250
I'm going to be your writer.

10:18.911 --> 10:25.379
So I sent off, I went and got some magazines that I thought I could perhaps write for, including Parents Magazine.

10:26.240 --> 10:35.552
And I sent off some queries, and Parents Magazine was having, in the issue I bought, there was an essay contest, and you were supposed to write about how you solve some aspects of parenting.

10:35.572 --> 10:39.377
So I wrote a little essay for Parents Magazine, and I sent off queries.

10:39.880 --> 10:44.204
waited for them to, you know, call me and say, oh, you're so wonderful, what have you been?

10:44.844 --> 10:51.070
And so the letters came back to the queries that said, don't be ridiculous, don't ever call us again, you know, more or less.

10:51.090 --> 10:53.972
And I said, well, fine.

10:54.013 --> 10:57.035
So, and they were, I mean, I did everything wrong.

10:57.115 --> 11:08.986
It was brown ink and everything, you know, because I thought it would be pretty to have brown scripts on my... How old were you about this time?

11:09.006 --> 11:09.066
35.

11:09.086 --> 11:09.246
Really?

11:09.817 --> 11:16.885
And let me just interject, you said people thought you wrote well, I mean did you write for publication?

11:17.025 --> 11:35.166
No, no, this was just friends, you know, and in school, and in school, because I wrote letters, I mean I always wrote, from the time I was a little girl I wrote, I used to try to write poetry when I was a little girl, and I sent a poem off, I sent my first poem off at nine years old

11:35.534 --> 11:40.040
and it was rejected by American Girl magazine, American Girl magazine.

11:40.721 --> 11:45.949
And I got the rejection letter and I was devastated.

11:46.089 --> 11:52.998
For one thing, my poem rhymed, and I couldn't imagine why they would have all this free verse and not take my rhyming poem.

11:53.039 --> 11:53.880
Was it a form letter?

11:54.721 --> 11:56.243
Yes.

11:56.263 --> 12:02.332
The last line of my poem was, the beauty enchantment now was broken.

12:02.472 --> 12:03.613
And she remembers it after a week.

12:03.633 --> 12:04.815
I remember the whole thing.

12:05.302 --> 12:08.587
But anyway, I really felt terrible.

12:08.607 --> 12:16.437
I was so embarrassed, and I went in my room and I cried, and I didn't submit anything for 25 years.

12:18.060 --> 12:22.005
But anyway, so I... It's a great life.

12:22.105 --> 12:23.507
You're doing very well.

12:23.527 --> 12:26.511
You're making my job very easy here.

12:26.531 --> 12:31.478
Anyway, so I got the re-diff for the queries, and said, fine.

12:31.778 --> 12:37.506
I keep thinking you're going to say somebody else or something else when you start with that.

12:37.526 --> 12:37.806
Yeah, yeah.

12:37.826 --> 12:39.649
Not me.

12:39.669 --> 12:42.533
So then we moved.

12:42.573 --> 12:43.835
We were living in South Bend.

12:43.855 --> 12:48.862
We moved to Newton, and I got a letter one day, and shortly after we'd moved, it was from Parents' Agency.

12:48.922 --> 12:52.727
I thought actually it was a solicitation for a subscription, which I did not want.

12:53.168 --> 12:56.212
So I threw it away, and I thought, well, but it's not, yeah.

12:56.693 --> 13:00.478
So I opened it because it was a different kind of envelope.

13:00.498 --> 13:01.279
I threw out checks like this.

13:01.647 --> 13:04.711
Where do you live?

13:05.592 --> 13:07.134
Where do you keep your garbage?

13:07.194 --> 13:09.797
I can check from 30 different newspapers and you never know.

13:09.897 --> 13:11.880
It looks like a stupid computer.

13:11.940 --> 13:13.221
You have to open all your mail.

13:13.422 --> 13:15.304
My wife says, you don't touch the mail anymore.

13:15.785 --> 13:18.208
I open all the mail.

13:18.548 --> 13:19.589
I'll take care of this.

13:19.690 --> 13:24.876
I have tons of junk and I routinely throw stuff away without opening it.

13:25.056 --> 13:25.697
I do too.

13:25.964 --> 13:26.605
I do too.

13:26.805 --> 13:33.813
But anyway, when I opened it, what it was, was a letter from Parents 19 saying, which I still have, is that?

13:33.833 --> 13:42.142
Saying, congratulations, it took us many months to call through the thousands of entries we received, but you are a winner, you know, the ParentWise contest.

13:42.642 --> 13:43.543
And the ParentWise?

13:43.684 --> 13:45.886
It was called the ParentWise contest.

13:46.006 --> 13:46.266
One word?

13:46.286 --> 13:47.868
Like wise, parent, you know, parent-wise.

13:47.968 --> 13:49.210
One word or two words.

13:49.230 --> 13:49.790
One.

13:49.810 --> 13:49.910
Okay.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.272
ParentWise is one word.

13:51.312 --> 13:51.452
Right.

13:51.953 --> 13:52.213
Right.

13:53.134 --> 13:54.115
So, um...

13:54.517 --> 14:01.226
They had chosen three people to win a prize of $500.

14:01.246 --> 14:13.082
What happened, actually, is that they ran the other things, like the prize winners of, you know, here are our efforts, but they held mine, and then they just ran mine as an article.

14:13.702 --> 14:22.534
It was in 1985, I think, and so I couldn't believe it.

14:22.574 --> 14:23.275
I couldn't

14:23.575 --> 14:32.047
And so I looked at the check for about a year, you know, I just kept looking at it and looking at it.

14:32.468 --> 14:37.175
And then I said, okay, I'm going to go spend it.

14:37.535 --> 14:44.165
So I went to my favorite store, which was called Limited Edition, and I bought stupid stuff.

14:44.185 --> 14:47.309
I bought a purse and jewelry and a scarf.

14:47.369 --> 14:49.212
I mean, nothing that I needed.

14:49.529 --> 14:52.954
And not even things that I was particularly crazy about.

14:52.974 --> 14:56.720
It's just that I had this money that I was going to go wildly spend.

14:56.740 --> 15:01.227
And then when I came home, I put all my stuff on the dining room table, and then I started crying.

15:01.788 --> 15:03.631
And I said, look what I bought.

15:04.011 --> 15:07.356
I could have bought a Mix Master if I'd thought about this.

15:07.376 --> 15:09.039
I could have bought a Mix Master.

15:09.059 --> 15:13.005
So I said, if I ever sell another article, I'm getting that Mix Master.

15:13.306 --> 15:16.931
So I started selling articles, in fact, regularly to Parents Magazine.

15:17.152 --> 15:19.515
Parents Magazine bought, I think, almost everything.

15:19.555 --> 15:21.338
I sensed it real well.

15:21.358 --> 15:25.384
It was a very happy combination because... Starting in 86.

15:25.665 --> 15:30.392
Yeah, because the editor at the time had children, my children's age.

15:30.652 --> 15:31.954
She is so fabulous.

15:32.014 --> 15:35.940
Elizabeth Crow is her name, and she's now the editor-in-chief at Manusel.

15:35.980 --> 15:41.068
She's a very wonderful, bright, generous, open woman who's not afraid

15:41.639 --> 15:47.568
to say to someone who's brand new, you've got a lot of talent and I'm going to, you know, and I'm going to use you.

15:47.588 --> 15:53.678
I mean, she didn't, she didn't make me feel, she just made me feel like I was a professional or something.

15:53.698 --> 16:02.893
So then I started writing for a lot of other magazines, and then I, well, I also was diagnosed with cancer in 85, and I, and I was.

16:02.913 --> 16:04.736
Is it above the same time you sent in that?

16:05.096 --> 16:05.457
It is.

16:05.657 --> 16:07.360
I had just, I had just,

16:07.728 --> 16:28.065
sold um you know that essay thing and i just started and and she had and she had uh i had told her i had another one that i wanted to send her and and she said fine did you tell me the title of the first piece that you sent in that one that you remember it but it's always involved

16:28.771 --> 16:35.102
It was about, ironically enough, it was about leaving work to stay home with your children, how that was a fine thing to do.

16:35.142 --> 16:42.716
And of course, then I immediately went back to work, because it didn't, but anyway.

16:43.237 --> 16:47.925
But let me ask, did you write this prior to your diagnosis or after your diagnosis?

16:47.945 --> 16:50.830
No, I had not been diagnosed.

16:52.598 --> 16:55.162
I was working part-time as a nurse.

16:55.182 --> 16:59.608
I was beginning to sell articles to Parents Magazine, and then I was diagnosed.

16:59.628 --> 17:01.371
I remember calling... No, no.

17:01.411 --> 17:04.956
Tell me when I'm... You brought up diagnosis, and I see it in here.

17:04.976 --> 17:09.383
Can you tell me what it was, or do you prefer not telling me what the diagnosis is?

17:09.643 --> 17:11.145
No, I'll tell you what it is.

17:11.165 --> 17:16.513
I had had a rash right here on my stomach for a number of years.

17:17.033 --> 17:17.694
Okay.

17:17.794 --> 17:20.277
But just tell me basically, was it skin cancer?

17:20.498 --> 17:22.320
No, this is why I have to tell you what it was.

17:22.380 --> 17:23.862
I had a rash.

17:23.962 --> 17:24.884
I thought it was nothing.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.606
It was treated with steroids and so on.

17:26.626 --> 17:27.828
It was finally biopsy.

17:27.848 --> 17:29.870
And I said, why are you biopsying it?

17:29.970 --> 17:33.155
Are you looking for basal cell carcinoma, which of course is skin cancer?

17:33.175 --> 17:38.502
And they said, no, we're looking for mycosis fungoides, which is a lymphoma and is incurable.

17:39.283 --> 17:41.706
And that's not the way that I was told, by the way.

17:41.987 --> 17:43.108
I'm shortening it.

17:43.173 --> 17:46.637
But you're a health professional.

17:46.737 --> 17:47.698
You know what's going on.

17:47.718 --> 17:51.862
What happened was I went to one doctor who said, I want to biopsy this.

17:51.882 --> 17:53.024
And I said, what for?

17:53.044 --> 17:55.666
And she said, this was here in Framingham.

17:55.706 --> 18:00.812
She said, I'm not going to tell you what for because if I tell you what for, you're going to go home and look it up and you're going to freak out.

18:01.032 --> 18:02.093
And we don't know what it is.

18:02.173 --> 18:05.677
So I said, well, now you have to tell me what you're looking for.

18:05.697 --> 18:07.419
So she told me mycosis fungoides.

18:07.459 --> 18:09.541
I went home and looked it up and freaked out.

18:09.561 --> 18:13.045
So that biopsy came back negative.

18:13.261 --> 18:16.024
What happens with MS is it's very hard to diagnose.

18:16.084 --> 18:18.706
You can get a lot of negative biopsies before you get a pocket.

18:19.808 --> 18:21.309
The rash persisted and spread.

18:23.371 --> 18:26.094
I had it biopsied yet again.

18:26.114 --> 18:29.618
I was at home.

18:30.759 --> 18:32.160
My kids were four and nine.

18:32.220 --> 18:33.582
They each had a friend over.

18:34.182 --> 18:35.003
Howard was at work.

18:35.043 --> 18:40.028
This doctor called me and said,

18:40.295 --> 18:41.776
We got your biopsy back.

18:41.796 --> 18:42.537
And I said yes.

18:42.557 --> 18:44.859
And I was wishing you'd hurry up and say it's fine.

18:44.939 --> 18:45.940
Just use steroids.

18:46.120 --> 18:50.704
And he said, it looks like something's going on in your skin.

18:51.124 --> 18:53.326
And I said, uh-oh.

18:53.947 --> 18:55.468
And I sat down on the bed.

18:55.488 --> 18:57.150
I remember I had my little apron on.

18:57.590 --> 19:00.052
And I said, is it MF?

19:00.072 --> 19:01.013
And he said, yes.

19:01.914 --> 19:04.336
And I said, my co-system.

19:04.736 --> 19:06.458
Isn't that the ugliest thing?

19:06.518 --> 19:07.779
Is it in here?

19:07.839 --> 19:09.120
Will I be able to spell this?

19:09.337 --> 19:13.864
M-Y-C-O-S-I-S, F-U-N-G-O-I-D-E-S.

19:13.924 --> 19:16.528
It means looks like fungus, which it does.

19:16.548 --> 19:19.233
It looks like a fungal kind of graphic.

19:19.253 --> 19:23.700
So… I won't make a big deal out of this, but… Yeah, don't make a big deal of it.

19:23.760 --> 19:25.403
It'll maybe be one paragraph.

19:25.423 --> 19:31.031
Well, the thing that it did… But it is pertinent to the writing that… It certainly is, yeah.

19:31.532 --> 19:35.158
And I… And so I… Which is what I'm fundamentally interested in.

19:35.240 --> 19:36.803
I talked to him for a little bit.

19:36.943 --> 19:39.187
I called Howard who came home immediately.

19:39.207 --> 19:41.471
He took a few days off from work.

19:41.651 --> 19:44.316
I took off from work.

19:44.336 --> 19:52.109
I went to the hospital library and I researched this disease and I saw and I got a million zeroes.

19:52.470 --> 19:54.193
Are we in 86 though?

19:54.342 --> 19:57.206
And this is after the Parents Magazine?

19:57.567 --> 19:59.569
Yeah, I had just begun.

19:59.730 --> 20:03.034
I called Elizabeth Crown and said, I'm going to be a little late sending this article.

20:03.134 --> 20:05.658
I just got diagnosed with a curable cancer.

20:06.038 --> 20:06.659
C-R-O-W.

20:06.679 --> 20:09.623
She's wonderful.

20:10.224 --> 20:14.851
So I was taking my kids to the beach.

20:14.871 --> 20:16.193
It was almost Jenny's birthday.

20:16.293 --> 20:19.978
In fact, it was 10 years ago on the 8th.

20:20.887 --> 20:34.863
So I was taking my kids to the beach and when they were playing in the water, I was reading these horrible articles about statistics about when people died and looking at these graphic photos of people in fourth stage disease.

20:35.844 --> 20:40.429
It was the worst time in my life ever.

20:41.010 --> 20:45.595
But the day I found...

20:45.710 --> 20:47.693
You're about the age of Lainey in the book.

20:47.713 --> 20:48.755
Of course, it's her husband.

20:48.995 --> 20:51.600
Yeah, yeah.

20:51.620 --> 21:07.245
But the day that it happened, this just will, I think, let you know briefly what my attitude about this is the evening of the day that I was diagnosed.

21:08.643 --> 21:12.469
I told the kids that I was going to take them berry picking over to a friend's house.

21:12.489 --> 21:14.872
And we went berry picking over to that friend's house.

21:14.912 --> 21:18.538
And I came back and I made pies.

21:18.578 --> 21:21.242
And they were the best pies I ever made.

21:21.282 --> 21:26.810
And my husband said, which was the most wonderful thing, he said, do you want to do the I Ching?

21:27.531 --> 21:29.855
And I said, yes, I want to do the I Ching.

21:29.875 --> 21:32.078
And I didn't know how to do it, but he knows how to do it.

21:32.499 --> 21:33.520
I know how to do it now, though.

21:34.327 --> 21:39.633
And the thing that I got back was molting of the skin.

21:39.833 --> 21:41.535
What's the I Ching on it?

21:41.555 --> 21:43.938
The I Ching is the Chinese Book of Changes.

21:44.258 --> 21:54.169
Oh, okay, so he asked you to... You get these, you toss coins six times and you get these little hexagrams, scissors back, and then you look it up and here's what you've got.

21:54.209 --> 22:01.397
I've always had incredible respect, you know, woo-woo mysticism around this kind of thing.

22:01.934 --> 22:05.339
But I got molting of the skin, okay?

22:05.780 --> 22:07.522
And I said, okay, well, that's a good sign.

22:08.183 --> 22:08.944
And I felt better.

22:09.265 --> 22:13.291
And nothing else made me feel better, because I don't have any traditional religion.

22:14.332 --> 22:20.421
And I didn't really trust anything that I read in articles, and I didn't trust my doctor.

22:20.461 --> 22:23.486
I just feel like we know so little, really.

22:24.367 --> 22:25.949
So that made me feel terrific.

22:26.109 --> 22:31.317
And what happened in the weeks subsequent to that diagnosis was I found out that the

22:31.634 --> 22:36.981
mean time of survival for a patient's diagnosis is 10 years.

22:37.602 --> 22:39.344
That's the mean time of survival.

22:39.364 --> 22:41.607
And I had very early stage disease.

22:42.328 --> 22:46.653
And he was telling me, it runs again.

22:46.833 --> 23:00.831
You can get radiation therapy, you can do chemo therapy, you can do local applications of steroids, you can use light therapy, electron beam therapy.

23:02.127 --> 23:12.983
It's so confusing, and I ended up, I went to Stanford University, I went to Temple University, I consulted everybody I could consult with.

23:13.784 --> 23:21.496
I ended up, and I quit nursing because I thought I was going to do electron beam therapy and aggressive chemotherapy, and I did not, but I thought I was going to do that.

23:21.516 --> 23:23.158
But that's why you kept, so you quit nursing about?

23:23.398 --> 23:26.062
I quit nursing because I didn't know what I was going to be doing.

23:26.123 --> 23:28.506
But three things are happening at the same time here.

23:28.857 --> 23:29.878
It started to write, yeah.

23:29.898 --> 23:32.962
It started to write, you've been diagnosed with cancer and you quit nursing.

23:33.122 --> 23:34.964
This was all happening about 1986 or so.

23:34.984 --> 23:35.925
Right, right.

23:36.066 --> 23:40.231
So I… This will show up as one sentence in two, by the way.

23:40.271 --> 23:40.951
That's fine.

23:41.132 --> 23:42.273
That's fine.

23:42.453 --> 23:53.987
It just, it was a real wake-up call, as you might expect, because what I was told by a badly misinformed doctor was I had about five years.

23:54.153 --> 24:02.124
And then when I found out that the mean time of survival was ten years according to NCI statistics, I went back to him with that information and you know what he said?

24:02.545 --> 24:05.389
He said, well, you have your statistics and I have mine.

24:06.230 --> 24:13.960
So I promptly found another doctor who shared M&Ms with me and who saw life a little bit more like I do.

24:13.980 --> 24:14.842
Did he say it smugly?

24:16.304 --> 24:18.547
Yeah, because he had been called on something.

24:18.587 --> 24:20.970
The fact was he was ill-prepared and he

24:21.338 --> 24:23.960
So at that point, they're dismissive, aren't they?

24:24.081 --> 24:25.502
Yeah.

24:25.942 --> 24:27.404
Sound familiar?

24:27.544 --> 24:30.727
I mean, you know a little bit about the business.

24:30.907 --> 24:32.228
Yeah, that's right.

24:33.049 --> 24:38.234
Yeah, he was embarrassed because he hadn't done his homework.

24:38.254 --> 24:49.084
Anyway, I never went back to nursing because I started selling articles like crazy for magazines, and I got to stay home with my kids, I got to write

24:49.672 --> 24:51.475
for a living, which I love doing.

24:51.495 --> 24:53.278
Was there a theme to what you were writing?

24:53.538 --> 24:54.760
Oh no, I wrote about my kids.

24:55.662 --> 24:58.607
Their first person, personal experience pieces.

24:59.148 --> 25:01.792
And then I began selling to other magazines as well.

25:01.812 --> 25:04.116
Can you name some of them?

25:04.136 --> 25:05.458
Name some of the magazines.

25:05.478 --> 25:12.169
Oh, Parents Magazine, I wrote for Woman's Day, I wrote for Family Circle, I wrote for Red Book, Ladies Home Journal,

25:13.988 --> 25:15.810
So there's a specific readership?

25:15.970 --> 25:17.372
Women's magazines, yeah.

25:17.632 --> 25:17.953
Okay.

25:18.033 --> 25:19.755
And there were personal experience pieces.

25:19.815 --> 25:21.777
And then I began writing fiction.

25:22.758 --> 25:24.420
And at about what point?

25:25.181 --> 25:26.022
When?

25:27.624 --> 25:35.233
I guess about, I guess just two or maybe three years into it.

25:35.393 --> 25:37.195
About 1990 or so?

25:37.917 --> 25:41.546
I mean, I can tell you exactly, but it would take some time.

25:41.566 --> 25:42.728
Somewhere around there, yeah.

25:42.869 --> 25:43.811
We were going to say about.

25:43.971 --> 25:45.595
About is a wonderful word.

25:46.598 --> 25:47.520
Yeah, about.

25:48.262 --> 25:48.562
About.

25:48.663 --> 25:50.948
I can look it up later tonight.

25:52.295 --> 26:02.332
But I didn't feel that I could ever write a book, because it seemed to me that it would be trying to keep track of little puppy dog's tales, you know, that you just do... How could you ever... A book meaning a novel.

26:02.352 --> 26:02.792
A novel.

26:02.812 --> 26:09.123
I mean, how could you ever, you know, you start it and then you write so many pages, how could you ever remember what was at the beginning?

26:09.143 --> 26:10.706
I mean, it's really impossible.

26:11.206 --> 26:11.908
I couldn't do it.

26:11.968 --> 26:12.829
I didn't want to do it.

26:12.849 --> 26:14.612
I would never, ever do it.

26:15.534 --> 26:15.754
So...

26:16.038 --> 26:26.708
Somebody called Parents Magazine in, let's see now, 91, looking, they said, who's a really good writer?

26:26.728 --> 26:35.636
Because I want to do a book on family traditions, and I want a really good writer to, you know, I have readers that I just want to do, and I've got the whole, you know, it's all set, I just need to write.

26:36.036 --> 26:37.277
So they said, oh, this is her.

26:37.738 --> 26:38.879
She's so very popular.

26:39.580 --> 26:43.183
So she called me and said, want to do this book, and I said.

26:43.203 --> 26:44.204
Was it an agent or a publisher?

26:44.544 --> 26:45.505
No, a book developer.

26:46.126 --> 26:48.609
A book developer.

26:49.009 --> 26:49.690
Yeah.

26:49.750 --> 26:51.792
Do you know about book developers?

26:52.513 --> 26:52.573
No.

26:52.633 --> 26:54.595
They're sort of like middle people.

26:54.635 --> 26:56.116
They're like hit hunters, so to speak, right?

26:56.477 --> 27:13.053
Well, they arrange for the art and some of the mechanics, which I don't really know about, and so they save the publisher money because they arrange for all this other stuff, and then they find a writer and they put together a package.

27:13.073 --> 27:13.634
Exactly.

27:14.515 --> 27:15.576
And they get half.

27:16.484 --> 27:17.527
It happens a lot.

27:17.547 --> 27:17.908
It happens a lot.

27:18.008 --> 27:18.650
Yes, it is.

27:18.771 --> 27:27.817
And of course, now when I think about it, I think, particularly since in this case, Rudolf Digest ended up paying for all the other stuff.

27:27.837 --> 27:31.287
So the book developer, please keep this off

27:31.570 --> 27:37.121
the record, but the developer did very well on that deal.

27:37.161 --> 27:38.523
She really cleaned up.

27:38.844 --> 27:40.768
Because I changed it.

27:40.988 --> 27:43.653
I made a new table of contents.

27:44.054 --> 27:46.619
It was really much more my book.

27:46.639 --> 27:49.364
But with all due respect, it was the book developer's idea.

27:49.485 --> 27:50.667
Exactly, exactly.

27:50.807 --> 27:53.292
And it did give you the exact amount of publishing.

27:53.474 --> 27:55.980
Not really, as it turns out.

27:56.000 --> 27:56.962
I'll tell you why not.

27:57.002 --> 27:59.167
So this book was titled, and I did see it.

27:59.207 --> 28:00.490
Family traditions.

28:00.670 --> 28:05.842
And when we're talking family traditions, we're talking about what, like Hanukkah, stuff like that?

28:06.022 --> 28:12.276
Yes, those traditions, but also...

28:13.235 --> 28:16.278
honoring things in ordinary days.

28:16.298 --> 28:18.100
You see a theme beginning to emerge here.

28:18.680 --> 28:21.383
Oh, God, I don't know.

28:21.483 --> 28:23.165
You can look at the table of contents.

28:23.185 --> 28:26.107
Well, we'll show it to me before I go, so I guess it's still in print.

28:26.768 --> 28:27.669
Yeah, still in print.

28:27.689 --> 28:28.910
It just came out of the paperback.

28:29.030 --> 28:30.732
Well, that's important that P.W.

28:30.812 --> 28:31.913
wants to know that letter.

28:31.933 --> 28:34.496
So why don't you just leave it here and I'll take a look at it.

28:34.976 --> 28:42.263
So anyway, I told her, no, I did not want to write that book because, first of all, I

28:42.935 --> 28:58.197
I didn't think I was a book writer, and secondly, although I would love to be, but secondly, I didn't have any traditions, and my family was not a great, you know, not rich in tradition, let me say simply.

28:58.277 --> 29:05.668
So she said, well, let me send you a proposal, and just take a look at it and see what you think.

29:06.357 --> 29:12.248
She sent me the proposal, and she had that most seductive of things on there, Family Traditions by Elizabeth Berg.

29:12.268 --> 29:15.574
And I thought, well, you know, maybe I could do it.

29:15.614 --> 29:18.279
And then I'd at least have a book.

29:18.359 --> 29:22.006
It would be a thing that people could hold in their hands and bring in the bathtub.

29:22.026 --> 29:25.933
And, you know, it would be really wonderful to have a book.

29:26.114 --> 29:27.336
So I said I would do it.

29:27.586 --> 29:33.511
It was an enormous amount of research, not like yours, I'm sure, but a lot of research for me.

29:33.632 --> 29:36.154
Can I borrow this, by the way, and I'll send it back to you?

29:36.174 --> 29:36.314
Sure.

29:36.975 --> 29:42.219
And I think it's a worthwhile book.

29:42.299 --> 29:44.121
I think it turned out pretty nicely.

29:44.982 --> 29:47.084
It was a pain in the butt to write.

29:47.204 --> 29:57.053
It just made me crazy because I like, no matter what I'm doing, whether I'm in the intensive care unit or making dinner, I like to have fun.

29:57.337 --> 29:59.599
So I wasn't having fun.

29:59.620 --> 30:00.561
It wasn't enough fun.

30:00.581 --> 30:01.702
How about the book did well, though?

30:01.902 --> 30:03.223
It did very well, yeah.

30:03.364 --> 30:11.753
It wasn't freeing enough, and I wanted to pull at that most creative part of myself, and this was, in fact, restricting me.

30:11.773 --> 30:16.878
So what I did was I said, all right, look, you have to write this book because you said you'd do it.

30:17.799 --> 30:22.905
So you write this book, but every day on Tuesday you can write whatever you want.

30:23.408 --> 30:25.650
because I had my writer's group on Wednesday.

30:25.690 --> 30:31.737
So what I would bring to my writer's group was fiction, which I allowed myself to write on Tuesday, which became Durable Goods.

30:32.738 --> 30:39.085
So I sent my agent— This was 1992 when it was published.

30:39.985 --> 30:40.226
Right.

30:40.466 --> 30:43.709
That was published in 1992, and I began writing Durable Goods.

30:44.010 --> 30:45.832
Did it appear as a hardcover first?

30:46.312 --> 30:46.472
Yeah.

30:46.492 --> 30:48.174
Want to see the hardcover?

30:48.194 --> 30:49.956
It looked just like that.

30:50.510 --> 30:53.874
How long did it take you to write it?

30:59.980 --> 31:02.703
I don't know, six months or so.

31:05.606 --> 31:07.568
Every Tuesday I would just write durable goods.

31:07.588 --> 31:11.192
And durable goods came out like pouring water out of the pitcher.

31:11.232 --> 31:12.574
Like throwing up.

31:12.634 --> 31:17.479
I would sit down with the typewriter and type continuously.

31:17.729 --> 31:24.221
Now, that was kind of a departure, wasn't it, from the essays that you've been writing, the pieces, the durable goods?

31:24.602 --> 31:25.243
Do you think of it?

31:25.263 --> 31:27.167
I always write really fast.

31:27.628 --> 31:33.859
I don't mean in terms of the production, I mean in terms of the writing, the story, the thematic stuff.

31:34.080 --> 31:41.273
It was, yes, it was, yes, because it was a novel, for one thing, and it took its own… But I mean thematically and…

31:41.843 --> 31:45.066
the kind of stories that you've been writing for the magazines.

31:45.266 --> 31:46.167
Yes, yes.

31:46.407 --> 31:49.871
It's your company voice that you use writing for women's magazines.

31:51.232 --> 31:59.540
I absolutely had my heart in what I was doing, but it's a different kind of writing.

31:59.560 --> 32:02.083
You can't be as loose as you are in a novel.

32:02.163 --> 32:06.067
And in durable goods, I just let myself go.

32:06.127 --> 32:09.690
And I didn't know that

32:10.548 --> 32:12.130
It was really going to be a novel.

32:12.271 --> 32:14.254
I just had this thing inside.

32:14.434 --> 32:15.536
It's like an irritation.

32:15.616 --> 32:19.141
It's like you feel something under your skin and you pick away at it.

32:19.201 --> 32:20.743
You need to get that thing out, you know.

32:20.783 --> 32:27.353
And I never know with any of my books, in fact, what it is exactly that I'm going to need to say.

32:27.674 --> 32:32.802
I start with a feeling and then whatever happens, happens.

32:32.822 --> 32:33.703
A couple of things.

32:35.101 --> 32:37.406
Did you have an agent or were you strictly with the book development?

32:37.426 --> 32:40.732
I did have an agent because I had… You did or you did not?

32:40.752 --> 32:47.165
I did have an agent because what happened was I had sold these fiction stories and I had started a novel.

32:47.245 --> 32:48.327
It was not Durable Goods.

32:48.448 --> 32:49.790
I had started another novel.

32:50.211 --> 32:55.742
That novel was… Which I showed… I was also doing television at that time because I was doing…

32:56.093 --> 32:58.695
video essays for special report television.

32:59.216 --> 33:05.701
And so my little career was beginning to grow, and I was getting these contracts, and I sort of didn't know.

33:05.842 --> 33:11.667
It felt like things were going to start happening more, and I knew that I was not able to handle that myself.

33:12.207 --> 33:18.292
So I asked Elizabeth Crow for the names of agents, and she gave me the names of agents.

33:18.333 --> 33:24.598
I made appointments with two of them, and I liked them both, but I chose Lisa Bancoff at ICM.

33:25.169 --> 33:27.132
And that's who you're still with.

33:27.152 --> 33:27.913
And that's who I'm still with.

33:27.994 --> 33:37.669
And I gave Lisa, you know, she had seen the beginning of this other novel I was writing, but Durable Goods said, excuse me.

33:39.332 --> 33:46.804
So I showed Lisa 90, 120, I guess, 120 pages of it.

33:46.824 --> 33:47.565
I hadn't finished it.

33:48.710 --> 33:54.037
And I didn't hear from her for a week or two, I guess, and I thought, oh, God, that's horrible.

33:54.537 --> 34:01.305
She's saying, she's saying, how can I tell her that maybe she should keep that nursing license up?

34:01.566 --> 34:09.375
And she called me one day, and she said, this is excellent.

34:09.435 --> 34:14.361
I'm sitting on the same bed where that doctor said there's something going on in your skin.

34:14.582 --> 34:15.763
But anyway...

34:16.148 --> 34:18.550
I said, oh, I can't really.

34:18.570 --> 34:19.111
I started crying.

34:19.271 --> 34:20.452
Oh, I'm so glad you like it.

34:20.472 --> 34:21.573
Are you living here at the time?

34:21.754 --> 34:22.855
No, I was living in Newton.

34:22.935 --> 34:24.757
And I said, I don't care what else happens.

34:24.817 --> 34:30.803
I'm just so glad you like it because it was sort of validation for me that I could write fiction and then could reach someone, you know.

34:30.863 --> 34:45.177
And so she said, I said, okay, well, when I was at the ABA, which I was for family traditions, I met someone who was looking for novellas.

34:46.658 --> 34:49.502
But anyway, she said, no, no, no, let me try something else.

34:49.562 --> 34:50.424
It was a different publisher.

34:50.844 --> 34:52.907
She said, let me just try something.

34:52.927 --> 35:01.079
So she sent Durable Biz out on a Friday to two publishers, one of them obvious, a random house.

35:01.099 --> 35:04.084
And on Monday, they both called back wanting books.

35:04.144 --> 35:05.947
So I was beside myself.

35:06.107 --> 35:07.549
I was beside myself.

35:07.749 --> 35:11.074
But having two operas gives your agent a little bit of latitude.

35:11.094 --> 35:12.416
Yeah, yeah.

35:12.436 --> 35:13.398
I couldn't sleep.

35:13.478 --> 35:14.239
I could eat.

35:14.259 --> 35:15.401
I could always eat.

35:15.421 --> 35:16.362
I can always eat.

35:16.595 --> 35:21.862
But I would just wake up in the morning and think it's just too wonderful.

35:21.882 --> 35:23.484
Did you have an auction between them?

35:23.544 --> 35:28.250
There was a preemptive offer from Landon House.

35:28.411 --> 35:29.572
Yeah, yeah.

35:29.592 --> 35:30.954
Who has been your editor from.

35:30.974 --> 35:31.815
Yeah, yeah.

35:31.835 --> 35:33.137
She's a nice, lovely woman.

35:33.437 --> 35:35.159
Oh, she is.

35:35.179 --> 35:36.942
She is such a classy broad.

35:37.022 --> 35:38.704
She is so great.

35:39.528 --> 35:43.634
The critics breakfast at Random House in March.

35:43.654 --> 35:46.778
She's the kind of editor who is so hands-off.

35:48.380 --> 35:49.602
It's like a dream.

35:49.622 --> 35:54.048
I mean, you know, she does not... The little guy is still running over there?

35:54.108 --> 35:55.169
Yes.

35:55.290 --> 35:59.115
So anyway... If you see the tapes stop, it means I have to flip it.

35:59.135 --> 36:00.637
The red light will go out?

36:00.657 --> 36:03.661
No, the red light won't stay on, but the thing will stop turning.

36:03.681 --> 36:04.422
Oh, I didn't...

36:04.925 --> 36:07.910
You want me to do a song?

36:07.970 --> 36:14.240
I used to be a singer in a rock band.

36:14.500 --> 36:19.187
I could do, I was, I could do Peace of My Heart.

36:20.249 --> 36:22.032
Maybe later.

36:22.613 --> 36:30.966
Anyway, so then Kate really loved Durable Goods, and let me tell you,

36:31.216 --> 36:34.901
I've had such incredible luck in publishing.

36:34.921 --> 36:39.088
I mean, people say all these terrible things, terrible editors.

36:39.909 --> 36:47.380
I had such wonderful experiences in magazines, and Kate Medina didn't, you know, I didn't have to do anything.

36:47.400 --> 36:49.002
You have a taste of this thing of rejection?

36:50.304 --> 36:51.406
I mean, you have it.

36:51.466 --> 36:53.970
Yes, I have American Girl magazine.

36:54.470 --> 36:57.595
Anyway, she was...

36:57.811 --> 37:27.345
absolutely behind durable goods i i think they did a fabulous job i think it's a beautiful looking dust jacket they were really behind it they were very excited about it um i felt great about about everything they did with durable goods so and i went on a little tour and everything and uh so then and then you know it's just been it's just been uh and that now we can kind of get into the books uh that was

37:29.367 --> 37:32.793
Yeah, coming of age.

37:33.154 --> 37:35.718
Yeah, I know, everybody rolls their eyes, oh, coming of age.

37:35.898 --> 37:45.435
And you mentioned, and if you don't mind when I come scratching around as these ideas come, and if I'd just like to bring closure to the cancer thing, so... So would I. Can you do that?

37:45.475 --> 37:48.921
So you basically got a clean bill now?

37:50.684 --> 37:50.944
No.

37:50.964 --> 37:53.248
No, it's not curable.

37:53.498 --> 37:59.086
What I do is the parameter is the status of my skip.

37:59.327 --> 38:04.494
So what I try to do is keep that rash off because it progresses.

38:04.735 --> 38:11.184
You start with a rash and then there's internal involvement and then you don't even want to hear about it.

38:11.284 --> 38:13.127
But what I found out is that

38:13.411 --> 38:16.499
is that it is not inevitably progressive.

38:16.539 --> 38:25.300
They can't get rid of it, but it doesn't mean that it will naturally progress through stage four in Kili, which is what the first guy said, and that people live 30 years with it.

38:25.360 --> 38:30.593
So it's not like, you know, I mean, I was like FedExing all my mail, you know.

38:30.573 --> 38:44.890
You know, a friend of mine, one of the best things that happened to me is a friend of mine called... Your attitude is unbelievable to be living with, you know, this kind of... No, well, because, you know, 10 years, I mean, do I look like I'm checking out to you?

38:45.191 --> 38:48.575
One of my really good friends, this is the way that I handled it.

38:48.695 --> 38:53.020
This is what helped me the most, aside from my deep kind of spirituality, which...

38:53.573 --> 38:54.715
sort of don't want to talk about.

38:54.755 --> 39:01.344
But anyway, she called me and said, you know, I wrote a letter to my friends, and I said, help me, because I'm really scared.

39:02.185 --> 39:07.372
And here's the deal, and here's what I've been told, and just, you know, think of this.

39:07.392 --> 39:07.993
These are friends.

39:08.013 --> 39:09.975
Yeah, you know, good friends.

39:09.995 --> 39:10.336
Women friends.

39:10.356 --> 39:11.017
I sent a letter.

39:11.057 --> 39:12.599
Not all women, no.

39:13.580 --> 39:14.261
I sent a letter.

39:14.441 --> 39:16.785
Anyway, so Wanda was her name.

39:16.805 --> 39:18.226
Two of the books, certainly, you know.

39:18.347 --> 39:18.667
Yeah.

39:18.927 --> 39:20.830
Well, Wanda called me and said,

39:21.586 --> 39:25.398
Well, you better not buy any green bananas.

39:25.539 --> 39:25.779
Great.

39:25.799 --> 39:26.662
There is a wonder.

39:27.886 --> 39:28.949
Yeah, she's not a nurse.

39:28.970 --> 39:30.896
She's nothing.

39:30.936 --> 39:32.461
There are the similarity answers.

39:33.043 --> 39:35.089
But she was called wonder.

39:35.407 --> 39:37.089
She was called a lender.

39:37.109 --> 39:41.876
You paid a bit of a bottle, a respectful bottle.

39:42.076 --> 39:43.218
Anyway, so that's what I do.

39:44.359 --> 39:50.508
There are times when the rash comes back and when that happens, I really get scared every time.

39:50.548 --> 39:53.652
It's not as scary as the first time.

39:53.885 --> 39:57.290
But there's nothing you can do to... I treat it.

39:57.491 --> 40:05.724
I used topical chemotherapy for years, and then they told me, you really can't keep using this, because this is not like Kool-Aid.

40:05.744 --> 40:10.331
And it can cause other kinds of cancer, you know.

40:10.551 --> 40:13.716
So the last time he said, well, why don't you try...

40:14.405 --> 40:16.329
Ultraviolet light.

40:16.349 --> 40:19.396
There's a treatment called PUVA where you take a pill and you get the light.

40:19.416 --> 40:21.801
Now I use the light at home in the basement.

40:21.901 --> 40:29.538
My point is, I guess, and again, we're talking about a paragraph, so we don't really have to go in great length on it.

40:29.558 --> 40:34.388
I mean, it's very personal stuff, and I don't feel comfortable asking if you don't go into it either.

40:35.161 --> 40:39.426
But it does certainly, it's there when you're writing these books, isn't it?

40:39.446 --> 40:40.007
Of course.

40:40.127 --> 40:42.049
I mean, you know, Talk Before Sleep.

40:42.109 --> 40:44.753
These two books have medical themes.

40:45.353 --> 40:54.384
Well, Talk Before Sleep, all of that dialogue between Ruth and Anne around cancer is my dialogue with myself, essentially.

40:54.945 --> 40:57.148
I did have a friend who died of breast cancer.

40:57.889 --> 40:59.110
We did not have.

40:59.680 --> 41:02.425
talks as soulful and searching as that.

41:02.606 --> 41:04.670
And it was one of my regrets, in fact.

41:05.010 --> 41:09.479
Also, my friend who died of cancer did not accept the fact that she was going to die.

41:09.499 --> 41:15.310
She said, on the day when, she ironically enough let me

41:15.543 --> 41:20.248
When I was diagnosed was one of the people who was really there for me.

41:20.268 --> 41:22.390
You know, she had not been diagnosed herself.

41:22.731 --> 41:23.692
Was she your friend?

41:23.732 --> 41:25.754
Yeah, my friend who died of breast cancer.

41:26.495 --> 41:31.460
We went out for a ride because I didn't want to tell her in front of my kids and I said, I've got cancer.

41:31.480 --> 41:35.805
And she started crying and I started crying and she was, you know, she was going to support me.

41:37.887 --> 41:40.470
Then she went on to get breast cancer.

41:40.872 --> 41:41.593
Exactly.

41:42.254 --> 41:45.798
And, you know, also after I was diagnosed, Kristen McAuliffe blew up.

41:45.818 --> 41:48.522
And I thought, wait a minute, Kristen McAuliffe didn't have cancer.

41:48.562 --> 41:49.343
You know what I mean?

41:49.363 --> 41:50.304
She was around here, right?

41:51.846 --> 41:52.867
I don't know where.

41:52.887 --> 41:54.630
She's up in New Hampshire.

41:54.650 --> 41:55.531
Her family's down here.

41:55.551 --> 41:58.815
Her parents are... Anyway, so yes, you don't ever know.

41:59.035 --> 42:03.841
And so, what were we thinking?

42:03.861 --> 42:06.525
Well, I guess I'm interested in a couple of things.

42:06.545 --> 42:07.126
We're getting there.

42:07.146 --> 42:08.247
This is kind of the way I...

42:08.834 --> 42:13.283
The closure for the campus, it's not gone.

42:13.784 --> 42:18.434
I treat it different ways, so far successfully.

42:18.674 --> 42:22.843
It certainly must give you an attitude of, you must have

42:23.245 --> 42:27.532
I'd have to give a life in general as a result of this, or you're living with something on a daily basis.

42:27.552 --> 42:28.834
Yeah, it never goes away.

42:28.854 --> 42:31.638
I mean, it's just like this horrible tap, and it never goes away.

42:31.658 --> 42:32.700
It's always behind you.

42:32.920 --> 42:37.968
But you've got such a positive outlook as Lady does in this particular book.

42:38.189 --> 42:41.314
Because you have a choice about how you're going to deal with that.

42:41.634 --> 42:43.497
It is relevant, isn't it?

42:43.678 --> 42:49.607
You can look at your skin all day long and say, oh god, this isn't fair, I'm too young at this, although I'm not too young anymore.

42:49.925 --> 42:51.667
But why do that?

42:51.687 --> 42:53.068
You're younger than I am.

42:53.088 --> 42:55.030
I'm younger than I am as young.

42:55.770 --> 42:56.511
I don't know about that.

42:56.771 --> 43:05.939
But you also cannot work as an intensive care nurse and not have some awareness of the fragility of life.

43:05.999 --> 43:19.071
You can't take care of an 18-year-old kid who was on a motorcycle yesterday drinking A&W and cruising and now on a ventilator with flat EDGs and not have some sense.

43:19.625 --> 43:22.791
that it's a dangerous thing to be alive here.

43:22.991 --> 43:33.010
Well, I have to ask, and we will weave this all together, because I fundamentally am interested in the work and the wellspring of creativity and all that.

43:44.583 --> 43:49.491
And the roommate of college is clad entirely, a total pain in it, and you know what.

43:49.511 --> 43:52.235
I mean, you want to kick her in the blind and say, what's wrong with you?

43:52.415 --> 43:53.497
You're living, you're alive.

43:54.198 --> 43:55.099
You know?

43:55.820 --> 43:59.866
I think, and to some degree, this describes your own outlook, doesn't it?

44:00.227 --> 44:03.212
And sharpened, perhaps, by your own experience that you've had.

44:03.272 --> 44:07.418
Well, but I also write about people that I wish I wore like.

44:07.938 --> 44:36.763
and and i have i do have a lot of optimism but i also have you know i also have days that i'm not so optimistic and if i were you know i'd like to be like laney i'd like to be that um continually delighted she is absolutely delighted in small ways all the time and and and i have that but i also feel like you know steamroller comes by every now and then and

44:36.895 --> 44:39.498
It's a joy she takes out of things.

44:39.839 --> 44:43.082
I mean, if the strawberries are nice, the honey is nice.

44:43.103 --> 44:44.204
It fits in the Tupperware.

44:44.224 --> 44:45.525
It fits.

44:45.646 --> 44:48.689
That's right.

44:48.709 --> 44:48.910
Exactly.

44:49.170 --> 44:52.053
I also had, you know— I have a lot of myself in that.

44:52.073 --> 44:52.934
I mean, this is great.

44:53.235 --> 44:53.615
I know.

44:53.635 --> 44:54.877
I know.

44:55.057 --> 44:55.898
Isn't this wonderful?

44:56.098 --> 44:58.341
Well, you know, why not?

44:58.721 --> 45:01.705
Yeah, and I guess, you know, I'm pretty—

45:02.461 --> 45:09.251
tired of the ever-so-correct cynical attitude and the models on the runway.

45:09.311 --> 45:10.253
I mean, what is that?

45:10.573 --> 45:12.676
There's hostile stuff going on.

45:12.696 --> 45:14.098
It's reflected everywhere.

45:14.138 --> 45:14.699
Everywhere.

45:14.739 --> 45:18.305
Models on the runway, movies, attitudes of people at Burger King.

45:19.226 --> 45:23.673
I'm a ranked sentimentalist, and I make no apologies for it.

45:23.693 --> 45:28.620
That's...erange emotions.

45:29.107 --> 45:44.729
And one of the reasons that that book is so important to me is that there it is, that if there was ever anything I ever wanted to do as a writer, it was to be able to say, look at this, and have someone say, I see it, you know, I see it now.

45:45.390 --> 45:55.384
And, you know, I... Actually, is it just being... Yes, I mean, just that I wanted... I remember being a...

45:56.967 --> 46:19.445
I don't know, I guess I was six or seven or something, and my mother was going to the bank, and I got out of the car with her, and there was a man sitting on the ground, and he didn't have legs, you know, they'd been cut off, and he was sitting on his blanket, and he had his cup, and he was asking for money, and I couldn't believe my eyes.

46:19.465 --> 46:20.427
I had never seen him.

46:21.520 --> 46:24.783
I had never seen anything bad happen to anybody, I guess.

46:25.084 --> 46:30.489
And he was smiling and I got in the car and I burst into tears.

46:30.969 --> 46:31.930
I couldn't believe it.

46:32.031 --> 46:33.392
I felt so bad for him.

46:33.972 --> 46:35.714
And my mother didn't know what to do.

46:36.035 --> 46:37.476
I think I put this in one of my books.

46:37.576 --> 46:42.281
But anyway, so she gave me some money.

46:42.321 --> 46:46.085
She gave me a quarter or something and I put it in his cup and he said, thank you little lady.

46:46.185 --> 46:49.048
And I said, but look how he is.

46:49.368 --> 46:51.510
Look how he is.

46:52.132 --> 47:18.240
that he doesn't have any legs but he's in the sunshine in his little half cut and he says thank you and he gets a quarter and I don't know and I wanted to be able to do something that would make someone else feel what I felt for that man and range of motion I think of anything I've ever written and there are two that I've written subsequent to that by the way so of the five

47:20.228 --> 47:24.676
That's when I finished two more after Re-Internation, yeah.

47:24.696 --> 47:26.419
Because really, that's another thing.

47:26.459 --> 47:33.010
You're publishing one a year now, which is, you're on a roll here, aren't you?

47:33.030 --> 47:34.793
But you know what?

47:35.133 --> 47:36.215
It's my greatest joy.

47:36.335 --> 47:37.217
It's so fun.

47:37.397 --> 47:38.419
It is not work.

47:38.559 --> 47:39.200
It is not work.

47:39.641 --> 47:40.983
It is so much fun.

47:41.044 --> 47:42.666
What's the title of the forthcoming book?

47:43.227 --> 47:43.688
The next one?

47:43.988 --> 47:47.033
After Range of Motion will be the sequel to Durable Goods.

47:47.053 --> 47:49.397
You better read Durable Goods because the sequel's coming out.

47:49.417 --> 47:50.378
I promise you.

47:50.579 --> 47:51.761
Joy School.

47:51.841 --> 47:54.305
I did have to go to bed last night.

47:54.405 --> 47:55.847
Well, I don't know what you're doing.

47:55.907 --> 47:58.932
Anyway, Durable Goods.

47:59.253 --> 48:06.304
Yeah, the sequel to Durable Goods is called Joy School, which will be next, and the one after that, which I just finished.

48:06.324 --> 48:06.765
Oh, really?

48:06.825 --> 48:08.848
So we're going to bring our characters up soon.

48:10.263 --> 48:13.506
I wasn't quite done with those characters.

48:13.546 --> 48:15.809
I wasn't quite done with them.

48:16.169 --> 48:17.190
You heard the voices.

48:17.410 --> 48:23.256
I wrote Joy Sewell, and I really like it.

48:23.376 --> 48:35.369
Now having read the two most recent books, I do see, even though they're decidedly different books, I find a nice and very interesting comparison between the two, which I will get to.

48:35.389 --> 48:39.493
But I do see the voice is kind of your voice in a way, do you think?

48:40.199 --> 48:42.222
Everything I write is.

48:42.282 --> 48:45.967
They both narrated, but I see a single voice here.

48:46.047 --> 48:47.109
Am I off on that?

48:47.169 --> 48:49.111
No, I don't think you're off at all.

48:49.132 --> 48:58.825
Mr. Rex T. Finnegan, who was my guidance counselor in high school, and I really loved him because he was a father figure to me, and he was the first one.

48:58.865 --> 49:00.207
This was high school?

49:00.427 --> 49:02.610
Yeah, in St.

49:02.851 --> 49:05.194
Louis, Missouri.

49:05.900 --> 49:09.967
I had a real hard time in high school.

49:09.987 --> 49:13.373
I had a lot of problems with depression and I had stuff going on at home and all that.

49:13.533 --> 49:23.550
He just had a kind of steady faith in me that was life saving in a way, perhaps literally.

49:25.774 --> 49:31.283
I wrote to him when I went to college and he had never read anything I had written before.

49:31.921 --> 49:35.064
And he wrote that saying, these letters are extraordinary.

49:35.204 --> 49:37.306
It is just you talking.

49:37.406 --> 49:39.228
I hear you talking in these letters.

49:39.388 --> 49:48.177
And so that's, I think the way I've always written is, I don't know, I do this by the seat of my pants.

49:48.237 --> 49:49.358
I don't know when I'm doing it.

49:49.378 --> 49:51.900
I mean, I didn't study anything.

49:51.920 --> 49:54.042
I haven't read Virginia Woolf.

49:54.123 --> 49:55.324
I mean, it's really embarrassing.

49:55.944 --> 49:57.726
But I have this,

49:59.579 --> 50:06.732
desire, you know, this, you know, need, a compulsion to write.

50:06.972 --> 50:15.687
And I did it when I, you know, when I was in high school, I wrote in my journal, in my black journal, I want to be dead, you know, all that stuff.

50:15.707 --> 50:16.829
And you write, write, write.

50:16.869 --> 50:20.676
And whenever I felt something strong, I had to write about it.

50:21.230 --> 50:22.653
when I began writing for magazines.

50:22.773 --> 50:24.557
Still, that happens.

50:24.577 --> 50:28.705
Those essays are born of a deep feeling that I had, whether it was love for my children.

50:28.925 --> 50:31.631
You watch your kids take a bath and you can't stand it.

50:31.711 --> 50:32.773
You just can't stand it.

50:33.354 --> 50:36.160
You have to write about why this is so wonderful.

50:39.847 --> 50:42.833
What was the question, Nick?

50:46.441 --> 50:47.763
Oh, voice, voice.

50:47.783 --> 50:49.565
All my books are my voice.

50:49.605 --> 50:55.534
My wife has heard a number of my interviews, and she's told me that my biggest problem is I can't shut up.

50:55.594 --> 50:56.976
She's a social worker, you know.

50:57.376 --> 51:00.641
And she said, you know, we're taught to let people talk and let them speak.

51:00.701 --> 51:04.907
So every time I will listen to some of these interviews, and I'll say, damn it, they're saying something nice.

51:04.947 --> 51:06.609
Why don't you let them keep going?

51:06.629 --> 51:08.292
That's what I do, too.

51:08.312 --> 51:11.436
And that's what I'm trying to do.

51:11.787 --> 51:15.453
Well, I used to get so impatient with the direction that the thing was going in.

51:15.473 --> 51:16.555
I said, oh, that's fine.

51:16.595 --> 51:17.717
Let's get back on track.

51:17.797 --> 51:18.318
Yeah, never mind.

51:18.338 --> 51:18.959
No, no, no.

51:18.979 --> 51:25.550
Anyway, you know, I do have a couple of things, and these are important so we don't forget, but give me for the record your husband's name and your children's name.

51:25.570 --> 51:29.356
Okay, but before we do that, okay, so we got the answer to that question.

51:29.376 --> 51:29.917
What was the question?

51:29.937 --> 51:31.519
In terms of voice, in terms of voice.

51:31.540 --> 51:33.142
Voice was the question.

51:33.182 --> 51:34.585
And it's always me talking.

51:34.625 --> 51:36.107
That's what Kate, yeah.

51:36.458 --> 51:38.802
What a brilliant interviewer.

51:39.042 --> 51:57.471
What Kate said in the letter that she sent out with a galley in Range of Motion, which I don't know if you saw, but she sent a really terrific letter out with a galley that said, when you read, oh, this is that part where I feel like you shut up about yourself.

51:57.788 --> 52:10.906
When you read Elizabeth Berg, you feel like your best friend is talking to you, leveling with you about her life, you know, and that that seems to be characteristic of what I write, and I think that's true.

52:10.926 --> 52:16.294
I mean, there's a voice in Durable Goods that is also my voice.

52:16.314 --> 52:20.880
All right, now let's give me the name of your full name, your husband and your children.

52:21.120 --> 52:22.903
Howard Jonathan Berg.

52:23.303 --> 52:24.004
Okay.

52:24.405 --> 52:26.648
And Julie is my older daughter.

52:27.033 --> 52:28.476
Julie Morin.

52:28.496 --> 52:33.265
I wanted to name her Morin, but no, I had to name her something that everybody would know.

52:33.425 --> 52:34.106
How do you spell Morin?

52:34.126 --> 52:35.749
She's M-A-R-I-N.

52:35.769 --> 52:36.872
Like Morin County, California.

52:36.892 --> 52:38.555
Yeah, isn't that a great name?

52:38.595 --> 52:41.160
That's a great name.

52:41.200 --> 52:43.143
She's old, but she's a student.

52:43.604 --> 52:47.792
She will be 20 in October, and she's a student at Connecticut College.

52:48.143 --> 52:54.212
Jenny Serene Berg, S-A-R-E-N-E, named after a hippie in Berkeley, California.

52:54.352 --> 52:55.033
S-A-R-E-N-E.

52:55.494 --> 52:56.455
S-A-R-E-N-E.

52:56.736 --> 52:57.817
She thought it was humiliating.

52:57.897 --> 52:58.679
Now she loves it.

52:58.699 --> 53:00.021
She wishes she was named Serene.

53:00.041 --> 53:00.341
You see?

53:01.182 --> 53:06.510
Anyway, she's going to be 15 on the 10th, on Monday.

53:06.550 --> 53:08.453
The girls are the best, I have to say.

53:08.473 --> 53:09.374
Oh, I know.

53:09.394 --> 53:11.898
And she goes to Dana Hall School.

53:11.958 --> 53:13.240
That's where?

53:13.642 --> 53:15.304
It's in Wellesley.

53:15.845 --> 53:19.851
My younger daughter goes to Faye, which is in South Wales.

53:19.871 --> 53:20.552
Oh, yeah, yeah.

53:20.652 --> 53:21.654
Faye and then she'll go to St.

53:21.694 --> 53:22.014
Mark's.

53:22.575 --> 53:24.097
I was a school nurse at St.

53:24.118 --> 53:24.338
Mark's.

53:24.378 --> 53:25.860
Faye is so wonderful.

53:25.980 --> 53:27.182
Yeah, watch out for St.

53:27.242 --> 53:27.563
Mark's.

53:27.583 --> 53:28.905
But she'll be living at home, right?

53:29.205 --> 53:30.948
Yeah, we're 15 minutes away.

53:30.968 --> 53:34.233
She might go to Worcester Academy where my older daughter is, would she like.

53:34.253 --> 53:35.214
Yeah, St.

53:35.234 --> 53:36.856
Mark's is pretty intense.

53:36.876 --> 53:38.419
I was a school nurse for a year.

53:38.439 --> 53:40.662
I mean, I know people at this inner city school,

53:43.561 --> 53:46.183
I like the high scramble eggs.

53:48.906 --> 53:51.108
But Faye is so great for our younger daughter.

53:51.128 --> 53:54.891
They were so close in age, we really had to spend one one place and one another.

53:54.931 --> 53:57.273
Yeah, that's a good idea.

53:58.154 --> 54:01.016
Anyway, so you gave me the name of the kid.

54:01.277 --> 54:02.598
So she's going to be a sophomore.

54:02.618 --> 54:04.299
And you've been married for a number of years.

54:05.300 --> 54:06.761
You've been married for a number of years.

54:06.781 --> 54:09.123
I've been married for 150 years.

54:09.163 --> 54:10.965
I got married in 74.

54:11.245 --> 54:13.247
Okay, so it's pertinent.

54:13.598 --> 54:16.781
Twenty-one years, my God.

54:18.563 --> 54:25.170
Yeah, but the relationship that Lainey has with Ginny in this book is really quite remarkable.

54:25.330 --> 54:30.475
I mean, it's… Yeah, there's a lot of… Howard really did that thing with the money.

54:31.076 --> 54:33.559
We lived in… Come on, is that right?

54:33.579 --> 54:35.120
Yeah.

54:35.140 --> 54:36.081
It's pretty wonderful.

54:36.382 --> 54:37.783
We lived in this real,

54:38.017 --> 54:39.659
He was a cab driver.

54:39.679 --> 54:45.325
He studied physics at the University of California, Berkeley, and so naturally became a cab driver.

54:45.745 --> 54:49.709
And I was a nurse's aide, and we didn't have anybody.

54:49.729 --> 54:50.110
Where did you meet?

54:50.130 --> 54:51.611
Oh man, times was hard.

54:52.172 --> 54:57.538
In Berkeley, I went out to Berkeley with my fiancé, sort of.

54:57.698 --> 55:02.143
He wasn't, we were done with that fiancé stuff.

55:02.163 --> 55:04.345
We were mostly just friends.

55:04.713 --> 55:08.837
My fiancee moved into Howard's house because he was working.

55:08.857 --> 55:10.378
This is in Berkeley?

55:10.539 --> 55:11.740
Where else?

55:11.780 --> 55:12.861
You went out there to do what?

55:12.881 --> 55:14.823
Just to be there?

55:15.483 --> 55:16.104
Okay.

55:16.124 --> 55:19.207
I really wasn't in a rock band, and John, the guy who didn't work.

55:19.227 --> 55:19.727
You really were.

55:19.747 --> 55:20.968
Yeah, I really was.

55:20.988 --> 55:22.009
It was the Blue Fox.

55:22.029 --> 55:23.171
I was the girl singer.

55:23.571 --> 55:27.214
So John, who was the organist for the band.

55:27.234 --> 55:31.458
I heard that click.

55:31.539 --> 55:32.640
No, it's still going.

55:32.840 --> 55:33.100
Okay.

55:33.400 --> 55:39.548
So John, who was the organist of the band, wanted to go back to Berkeley.

55:39.728 --> 55:44.875
He'd been to Berkeley, and he always loved it, and he always wanted to go back, so he was going to go back to Berkeley.

55:44.915 --> 55:46.117
So I said, fine, I'll go.

55:46.157 --> 55:55.729
So he bought a van, a lots of typewriter company, a big yellow van, and we went to California.

55:56.502 --> 56:01.516
He moved into Howard's house, and Howard was a hippie.

56:02.459 --> 56:03.342
This is in the 70s, 60s?

56:03.683 --> 56:08.757
This was in...

56:10.002 --> 56:17.413
I was out there.

56:17.493 --> 56:19.936
I was a naval officer on an aircraft carrier.

56:20.417 --> 56:21.779
Whoa!

56:21.899 --> 56:23.882
That was... Home-based in Alameda.

56:24.163 --> 56:24.603
Really?

56:24.623 --> 56:24.884
Yeah.

56:25.144 --> 56:25.925
Oh, yeah, well.

56:25.945 --> 56:27.027
That's about three years out there.

56:27.047 --> 56:28.589
That's the place, yeah.

56:28.689 --> 56:31.614
So I hated California, actually.

56:31.634 --> 56:32.955
I left it out and I didn't look back.

56:33.116 --> 56:36.060
Physically, I drove across the Bay Bridge.

56:36.428 --> 56:38.851
heading south to take the southern route.

56:38.871 --> 56:41.435
It did not look, I've been back many times since.

56:41.455 --> 56:43.958
I really like the people, I have to say.

56:44.179 --> 56:55.555
We still have friends from there, but I just, I was so sick of calling directory assistants and having somebody so happy on the other end of the line.

56:55.595 --> 56:58.599
It made me nuts, and every day was so beautiful, so beautiful.

56:58.659 --> 57:00.602
You can go outside, and I couldn't stand it.

57:00.662 --> 57:03.145
I really need the season, so we left.

57:06.095 --> 57:09.278
I'm so happy to be here.

57:09.298 --> 57:11.741
I'm just like, shut up!

57:11.761 --> 57:15.105
Anyway, so, anyway, that's how I met him.

57:15.125 --> 57:22.152
And he's now gainfully employed as a... Now he's a director of marketing at IBM.

57:22.172 --> 57:22.392
Oh, really?

57:22.412 --> 57:22.913
No kidding.

57:23.333 --> 57:24.094
Yeah.

57:24.294 --> 57:26.657
Here in Basler, in Boston.

57:26.737 --> 57:27.638
No, okay.

57:28.038 --> 57:29.360
Here's the Connecticut part.

57:30.381 --> 57:35.106
He was at Lotus, and he got this job offer from IBM in White Plains, New York.

57:35.626 --> 57:38.111
And we said, should we do this?

57:38.131 --> 57:39.414
And we said, well, let's try.

57:39.534 --> 57:40.877
If we don't like it, we'll come back.

57:42.099 --> 57:45.045
So he still works in White Plains.

57:46.388 --> 57:47.751
But he works from home.

57:48.632 --> 57:53.602
The default schedule is that he works from home Monday and Friday.

57:53.883 --> 57:56.368
And then he goes to White Plains Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.

57:56.990 --> 57:59.695
He can do it for three hours, I guess.

58:00.035 --> 58:00.736
It's not bad.

58:00.756 --> 58:05.044
His father lives in Hackensack, New Jersey, so he stays there when he goes to work.

58:05.064 --> 58:07.067
They take me every once in a while through the record.

58:07.087 --> 58:08.790
Yeah, that's not a bad paper, is it?

58:08.890 --> 58:09.591
Not bad.

58:09.731 --> 58:16.683
And they're starting a book supplement this fall, which I'm going to be very... You might have a book that you want to suggest to them?

58:16.703 --> 58:20.770
No, I mean a book supplement for book features, not for book books.

58:21.745 --> 58:26.009
Couldn't you write about your book under a cigarette?

58:26.049 --> 58:26.770
Wouldn't it be great?

58:27.850 --> 58:28.551
Why not?

58:30.153 --> 58:31.854
You've got to write your call about your book.

58:32.034 --> 58:36.218
I've got an instant audience of 30 papers, but how can you do it?

58:36.238 --> 58:36.879
I can't do it.

58:37.599 --> 58:39.501
I think you should think about it.

58:39.801 --> 58:47.068
What I do is I give them a little shirt, what's called a shirt tail, a little tagline about who I am, and I always mention the book in there.

58:47.088 --> 58:48.169
Well there you go.

58:48.309 --> 58:50.571
And most of them run it, and that's better than that.

58:50.971 --> 58:51.752
That's great.

58:52.188 --> 58:55.173
Okay, so we've got the biographical stuff.

58:55.193 --> 58:55.693
All right.

58:55.754 --> 58:58.097
Your husband went to the University of California, Berkeley.

58:58.157 --> 58:59.580
And where did you train to be a nurse?

59:01.623 --> 59:03.406
I went to St.

59:03.706 --> 59:07.472
Mary's Junior College in Minneapolis.

59:07.552 --> 59:10.737
Minneapolis takes me.

59:11.628 --> 59:16.314
You know, my Tim O'Brien piece out there was huge because it was Minneapolis.

59:16.334 --> 59:21.020
So I'm really thinking of ways to get this story to Minneapolis.

59:21.040 --> 59:23.083
Yeah, yeah, well that's where I went.

59:23.123 --> 59:26.568
What happened was I went to the University of Minnesota and I was an English major.

59:26.608 --> 59:38.243
And then I decided that I wanted to be a human, I wanted to teach English because I wanted to be in front of the classroom saying, when this author says this thing

59:39.286 --> 59:41.469
Don't you feel this yuck, yuck, yuck.

59:41.489 --> 59:44.472
And everybody would say, oh, Miss Huff is so wonderful.

59:44.552 --> 59:49.678
I never understood, you know, so-and-so until... Meanwhile, you know, I hadn't read anything.

59:49.858 --> 59:51.740
So then I abandoned that idea.

59:51.881 --> 59:54.664
I wanted to be a humanities major.

59:54.684 --> 01:00:01.011
Then I decided if I was going to be a humanities major, it had a thing to do with quit school, because you obviously wouldn't learn about humanities being in school.

01:00:01.031 --> 01:00:04.275
So I quit school and became an information clerk at the Radisson Hotel.

01:00:06.257 --> 01:00:08.820
And I had a whole bunch of jobs, and...

01:00:09.188 --> 01:00:13.516
I was a waitress, and I cleaned chickens in a little cafeteria.

01:00:14.157 --> 01:00:14.899
No!

01:00:14.919 --> 01:00:18.405
On the West Coast... Okay, okay, okay, we're getting all next up.

01:00:18.566 --> 01:00:24.156
On the West Coast, okay, I have been... Okay, my last job was... No, no, no, no, wait.

01:00:24.417 --> 01:00:29.506
In fact, I'm going to turn the tape on the other side right now, all right?

01:00:29.526 --> 01:00:30.488
And now we're going to...
