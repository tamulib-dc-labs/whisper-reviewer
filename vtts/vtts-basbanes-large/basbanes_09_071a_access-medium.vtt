00:02.866 --> 00:16.706
I guess, you know, this is just an arbitrary place to start.

00:16.726 --> 00:20.131
Your father is very definitely a presence in this memoir.

00:20.151 --> 00:23.736
In fact, it almost brackets the tour in Vietnam.

00:24.217 --> 00:32.248
I mean, perhaps you could just explain the decision to claim the book in that manner as an opening.

00:33.899 --> 00:43.889
Or is that just something that happened?

00:43.909 --> 01:02.387
Well, whenever you go into memory for a book, the problem is, at least it is for me, is controlling what you let loose when you open the box of memory.

01:03.008 --> 01:11.841
trying to discern the pattern in those memories that make them significant, that give shape to your life.

01:12.943 --> 01:23.318
And so I'm thinking about getting all this massive material down, as I did when I first started writing this book, trying to see what's going on in all this.

01:24.200 --> 01:25.341
What's the shape of this?

01:25.842 --> 01:26.703
What was I after?

01:26.763 --> 01:27.665
What was going on?

01:27.685 --> 01:31.210
And it began to seem to me that

01:32.084 --> 01:39.611
So much of what I was up to at that time was trying to figure out what it was to be a man.

01:40.472 --> 01:53.865
The natural thing to do is to think of one's father, to measure oneself against one's father, all that kind of thing.

01:54.105 --> 02:01.112
My father hadn't been around much, but I really began to see that I had made

02:01.463 --> 02:16.105
more or less conscious attempts in my life to separate myself from my father, to be a different kind of person than my father, and that this had cost me something.

02:16.746 --> 02:28.303
And I began to feel a very strong pull about the time that the events in this book take place to get to know him better, to connect with him again.

02:28.323 --> 02:31.167
I was kept from doing that.

02:32.328 --> 02:55.935
by a certain fear, I suppose, of falling under his spell, becoming like him, and a certain stiff neckness, a certain pride, a certain kind of moral superiority, perhaps, that I felt that the events of this book kind of knocked out of me, I think.

02:55.975 --> 03:01.862
So at the end of the book, as indeed at the end of his life, we had a

03:02.939 --> 03:11.169
We became rather wonderfully reconciled, I think, and accepted each other in a way that we never really had before.

03:13.392 --> 03:26.087
I see as I'm looking through the book this—I mean, I will refer to myself as he, because it's more natural somehow for me to do that.

03:26.268 --> 03:29.031
I see this— Do you normally do that, by the way?

03:29.568 --> 03:36.976
When I'm talking about myself as I appear in a book, yeah, yeah, because I mean, I was twenty-five, thirty years.

03:36.996 --> 03:37.696
When was it?

03:38.077 --> 03:43.622
The book ends in 1968, which is, uh... How old were you, by the way, at that point?

03:43.642 --> 03:44.884
I was twenty-two.

03:44.964 --> 03:45.684
Okay, that's what I thought.

03:45.765 --> 03:49.588
I mean, you've written two memoirs and you've carried it to the rightful age of twenty-two.

03:49.608 --> 03:51.090
We'll get to that later.

03:51.290 --> 03:52.311
This is the last one.

03:52.331 --> 03:54.193
I never meant to write this one.

03:54.213 --> 03:55.635
I never meant to write this one.

03:55.655 --> 03:56.976
Well, we have to talk about this.

03:57.327 --> 03:59.069
But anyway, where was I?

03:59.550 --> 04:00.992
I'm sorry, I interrupted you.

04:01.052 --> 04:01.613
That's okay.

04:01.653 --> 04:03.015
You don't mind that, I hope.

04:03.035 --> 04:05.398
I was asking about referring to yourself.

04:06.119 --> 04:06.740
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.582
Yeah, I mean, okay, when was it?

04:08.662 --> 04:10.324
Twenty-six, twenty-seven years ago.

04:10.344 --> 04:17.374
I mean, the events actually began in the book when I was eighteen, so that was over thirty years ago now.

04:17.394 --> 04:19.357
Thirty-one years ago.

04:19.377 --> 04:26.406
And so the person, though he is me in the sense that I inhabit this body,

04:27.213 --> 04:31.919
feels like a different person to me in a way, which is probably why I'm able to write about him.

04:31.940 --> 04:35.424
I guess what I'm driving at, is he a character for you?

04:35.444 --> 04:38.589
He's a fiction writer, and you've certainly been a character.

04:38.629 --> 04:41.733
Yeah, he is something of a character in the sense that I see around him.

04:42.254 --> 04:47.301
I couldn't write about myself as I am now, as I was yesterday.

04:47.401 --> 04:53.449
I couldn't sit down and write a short story about something that happened, using myself as the main character yesterday.

04:53.469 --> 04:54.030
I don't have that kind

04:56.508 --> 04:57.749
at this close distance.

04:58.490 --> 05:01.754
At the distance of thirty years, I do, I think.

05:01.854 --> 05:13.628
So in a sense, I see this—he comes fairly well-equipped with idiosyncrasies and defining characteristics.

05:13.648 --> 05:17.433
And I suppose, in a way, I'm forced to treat him as a character.

05:17.753 --> 05:22.519
By the very act of putting him in a book, there's no way not to.

05:23.160 --> 05:24.321
But in any case,

05:25.364 --> 05:33.212
I look back through the book, I see this all kind of searching endlessly for a father, I guess.

05:33.812 --> 05:39.618
You know, and the Army, and his commanding officers, and the sergeant who sort of takes care of him.

05:39.718 --> 05:46.104
And physically you care for him at the end of the book.

05:46.124 --> 05:47.486
Oh, yeah.

05:47.506 --> 05:47.866
I think.

05:48.467 --> 05:49.007
Oh, yeah.

05:49.027 --> 05:55.033
I mean, if you're looking for literary things in here, I mean, I think it's very significant that you physically tend to him.

05:55.300 --> 05:57.943
even if it's not for a tremendously long period of time.

05:59.245 --> 06:03.170
But then, by the same token, you know that you're probably not going to see him again.

06:03.190 --> 06:04.772
I mean, you say you were, and you don't.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.314
Yeah, that's right.

06:06.334 --> 06:06.675
I didn't.

06:07.716 --> 06:09.218
He died within two years, I guess.

06:09.258 --> 06:09.839
Yes, he did.

06:10.560 --> 06:12.242
Exactly two years later.

06:12.282 --> 06:20.953
And I promise not to dwell at any length on your brother and your father in this piece, but of course it's germane.

06:21.440 --> 06:50.940
I mean, he was, uh, his love, his love of books was important to me because it caught me when I was, uh,

06:52.608 --> 07:22.497
And I think it's a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,

07:28.096 --> 07:55.943
Well, when we first got together when I was about fifteen or fifteen, something that we spent with my father in

07:56.851 --> 08:01.395
He had me reading classics, like… It was kind of an education program.

08:01.415 --> 08:05.419
Oh yeah, something of one, yeah, because I had been rather badly educated.

08:05.519 --> 08:11.045
And oddly enough, I actually had read a lot of classics, just on my own.

08:11.065 --> 08:15.229
A lot of Dickens, a lot of Jack Wand, and that kind of thing.

08:15.890 --> 08:17.051
I'd read a lot of Hawthorne.

08:17.411 --> 08:24.478
I liked Hawthorne a lot, without ever realizing that, you know, the weight of the writer, the complications of what I was

08:28.087 --> 08:32.194
But he had me read the Greek tragedies.

08:32.554 --> 08:33.796
He had me read Shakespeare.

08:36.200 --> 08:37.502
He had me read Camus.

08:38.364 --> 08:39.526
Oh, yeah.

08:39.606 --> 08:42.891
I mean, and did you take this as castor royal, or were you in here?

08:42.911 --> 08:43.653
Oh, no, no, no.

08:43.673 --> 08:44.133
No, not at all.

08:44.153 --> 08:44.554
I loved it.

08:44.895 --> 08:45.416
I really did.

08:45.656 --> 08:46.998
I loved it.

08:47.018 --> 08:52.407
And just from time to time over the years when he would come across a book that, uh,

08:53.028 --> 08:56.413
Well, it was just hard to read.

08:57.094 --> 09:02.181
It was just hard to read.

09:02.762 --> 09:09.151
The intellectual vacuity almost.

09:09.171 --> 09:10.052
Yeah, it was.

09:10.112 --> 09:12.836
There was something so definite about it.

09:17.042 --> 09:18.765
The first few months there, I read.

09:18.785 --> 09:21.328
And then, I don't know.

09:21.348 --> 09:22.630
I don't know whether this was.

09:27.976 --> 09:34.447
You know, I think that's just bound to be mistaken.

09:35.248 --> 09:48.851
I think that in a funny way it might have been possible for somebody in World War I, for example, to generalize from his own experience about the experience of others, because they were so similar.

09:48.931 --> 09:52.397
I mean, Robert, the experience of Robert Graves was, I think,

09:57.524 --> 10:05.613
churches in World War I. But everybody in Vietnam had completely different experiences, I discovered, and responded to them in very different ways.

10:06.093 --> 10:15.724
And my own response was that it was deadening.

10:16.084 --> 10:25.675
The experience of it was so deadening that you tended to avoid introspection, you tended to avoid the kinds of

10:31.848 --> 10:40.181
There was a kind of massive act of psychological evasion going on among most of the people I knew, and it certainly included me.

10:40.863 --> 10:45.851
And so that's the kind of rigorous intellectual activity that's implied by serious reading.

10:45.971 --> 10:52.161
I mean, I read Newsweek and Time, and I read a lot of mysteries and that kind of thing.

10:52.201 --> 10:55.967
But I didn't read good books over there.

10:55.987 --> 10:59.172
I have to say, in contrast, I was over there.

10:59.337 --> 11:00.678
Well, you were there for two years.

11:00.858 --> 11:06.203
I was on a ship, so I mean, I was a naval officer on aircraft carrier.

11:06.223 --> 11:06.343
Okay.

11:06.744 --> 11:07.284
So I did.

11:07.905 --> 11:08.305
Which one?

11:08.685 --> 11:09.226
The Ueskine.

11:10.227 --> 11:10.507
Uh-huh.

11:10.627 --> 11:12.168
So you were what, anchored off?

11:12.569 --> 11:13.049
Not anchored.

11:13.069 --> 11:14.430
We did fire-offs every day.

11:14.471 --> 11:16.112
Oh, I see.

11:16.132 --> 11:20.816
You guys were sending, were you sending planes to North Vietnam, or?

11:21.637 --> 11:26.261
Actually, the northern— We don't need this on ship.

11:26.601 --> 11:26.781
Go ahead.

11:26.902 --> 11:28.483
Yeah, the place that I was,

11:29.797 --> 11:33.942
I probably maybe exaggerated how heavenly it really was.

11:34.082 --> 11:39.629
I mean, if I had been living out off the ground, off the ground, you know, the way some guys were.

11:39.669 --> 11:40.610
You had a real bed, right?

11:41.311 --> 11:42.352
Yeah, I had a cot.

11:42.553 --> 11:51.584
But, yeah, I mean, you know, it was a hell of a lot better than the way your average American infantry was.

11:51.604 --> 11:58.993
Well, I remember I flew into Danang once, en route to QB Point, and so we had to spend one at the BOQ,

11:59.429 --> 12:05.458
up there, and we didn't drink all night, but it was like a barracks with a cot.

12:05.478 --> 12:07.080
They had the P.O.Q.

12:07.901 --> 12:13.329
So I guess by comparison to the way people looked at the P.O.Q.

12:13.449 --> 12:29.031
It was, well, yeah, I mean it was a hooch with a couple of cots and, you know, with mattresses, and we had a

12:29.348 --> 12:32.771
Good sound system and a television.

12:32.791 --> 12:35.154
Did you get a Ticom, by the way?

12:36.155 --> 12:37.596
Yeah, I did.

12:37.796 --> 12:38.137
I did.

12:38.157 --> 12:41.960
As a matter of fact, I traded it for something.

12:42.020 --> 12:46.305
I don't remember what, before I left, because I didn't really want it.

12:46.325 --> 12:48.266
It's funny, I didn't want any souvenirs.

12:49.107 --> 12:51.910
I didn't bring anything back.

12:51.970 --> 12:54.533
Now, did you keep notes while you were there?

12:55.093 --> 12:58.056
I wrote letters to my brother.

13:01.445 --> 13:02.706
And that was about it.

13:02.726 --> 13:04.589
I remembered what I needed to remember.

13:05.950 --> 13:12.177
If you look at the book, you'll see this isn't a detailed log.

13:12.918 --> 13:21.968
The book is built around a series of vivid incidents that themselves have stayed with me over the years.

13:22.209 --> 13:28.836
In a funny way, I'm glad I didn't take notes, because it seems to me that what is essential in that experience for me

13:29.693 --> 13:31.615
is exactly what would have stayed with me.

13:31.696 --> 13:33.718
If I'd forgotten it, it wouldn't have been that essential.

13:34.519 --> 13:37.263
Well, I'd have become journalistic at that point, too.

13:37.303 --> 13:38.324
It would change.

13:38.344 --> 13:40.326
You would want to avoid that.

13:40.367 --> 13:41.027
That's right.

13:41.188 --> 13:41.788
That's right.

13:42.209 --> 13:53.343
And I think I might have overwhelmed the narrative with detail, because all details seemed interesting at the time.

13:53.423 --> 13:58.890
And parsing them out later might have been a problem, whereas

13:59.714 --> 14:18.762
Over the last twenty-five years, my memory has been ordering, without even my participation, my memory has been making a hierarchy of what happened and what was essential to itself, to my idea of what happened, which is what the book really is.

14:18.782 --> 14:24.270
So does this memoir really need thirty years of thought?

14:25.195 --> 14:29.379
I won't pretend I spent thirty years thinking about this.

14:29.459 --> 14:29.820
I didn't.

14:31.942 --> 14:55.185
What it maybe needed was thirty years' distance, twenty-five years' distance, for me to be able to summon up the camaraderie to admit what I did and to take responsibility for the kind of things that I and other people did over there.

14:56.026 --> 14:58.650
things that happened to us, things that we did to other people.

14:59.712 --> 15:07.024
In that sense, the twenty-five years must have been necessary, because I certainly wasn't willing to do it before.

15:07.685 --> 15:12.312
Do you consider Vietnam the event of your generation?

15:12.793 --> 15:13.314
Yes, I do.

15:13.774 --> 15:23.670
And for better or worse, are you—I guess I'll have to come up with a better verb, but I mean, pleased.

15:25.270 --> 15:35.139
I don't know.

15:35.159 --> 15:36.781
I don't know about that.

15:36.921 --> 15:53.877
I like to think that on one level, in one sense, I wouldn't have missed it for the world.

15:54.869 --> 16:06.204
And then I have to back around fast and say, this presumes that I didn't get killed, that I didn't get seriously wounded, you know.

16:06.344 --> 16:13.875
That's why I didn't go to Pensacola to become a pilot, because I'd love to fly.

16:13.895 --> 16:14.095
Sure.

16:14.275 --> 16:17.259
Three thousand other guys wouldn't have missed it either.

16:17.539 --> 16:20.223
You know, they felt a lot of good at doing them.

16:20.523 --> 16:23.948
And there got a lot of guys running around without legs and arms and

16:24.130 --> 16:25.091
all their brains.

16:27.313 --> 16:43.827
So, you know, to talk about the war simply as a kind of bank of experience on which a future writer might draw, which is, I have to admit, the kind of idea I had of it when I was young, of war.

16:44.528 --> 16:45.769
I just didn't have the imagination.

16:46.470 --> 16:48.591
Prior to going to Vietnam?

16:48.611 --> 16:52.635
Yeah, I think it started to hit me when my friends started getting killed over there.

16:52.902 --> 16:54.544
Well, you were pretty gung-ho during training.

16:54.624 --> 16:55.425
Yeah, I was.

16:55.445 --> 16:56.266
Oh, I was very gung-ho.

16:56.286 --> 17:00.091
I was a very, as they say, strapped troop when I was first.

17:00.131 --> 17:08.201
When I read the chapter, you were talking about the skipper, you know, talking about himself.

17:08.221 --> 17:11.365
Oh, yeah, I was a really gung-ho soldier.

17:11.425 --> 17:20.817
In fact, you know, at a certain point when I was first in and doing airborne training and all that stuff, I even thought,

17:21.269 --> 17:23.011
Well, this wouldn't be a bad life, you know.

17:23.171 --> 17:23.591
Okay.

17:23.691 --> 17:24.612
Yeah.

17:24.693 --> 17:25.914
I never gave that a thought.

17:26.514 --> 17:26.975
Yeah, I did.

17:27.035 --> 17:28.276
It was a fleeting thought.

17:28.296 --> 17:36.425
Because, you know, I knew I wanted to be a writer, and I knew that these things, I mean, at bottom, they offered me duty in London.

17:37.946 --> 17:39.588
I mean, nice duty.

17:39.608 --> 17:39.788
Yeah.

17:39.808 --> 17:41.890
But I had to extend two and a half years.

17:42.030 --> 17:42.991
No way.

17:44.493 --> 17:47.015
Well, it did last long.

17:47.035 --> 17:49.538
I mean, once I, once I,

17:53.905 --> 18:23.136
And, uh, you know, there's a lot of, uh, there's a lot of, uh, there's a lot of, uh, there's a lot of, uh, there's a lot of, uh, there's a lot of, uh, there's a lot of, uh, there's a lot of, uh, there's a lot of, uh, there's a lot of, uh, there's a lot of, uh, there's a lot of, uh, there's a lot of, uh, there's a lot of, uh, there's a lot of, uh, there's a lot of, uh, there's a lot of, uh, there's a lot of, uh, there's a lot of, uh,

18:23.588 --> 18:32.321
of physical challenges that I was overcoming, and for once in years actually being successful in something.

18:32.781 --> 18:39.791
When I joined the Army I had nothing but a record of failure behind me, basically, and here was something that I found myself doing well at.

18:39.871 --> 18:43.256
Which is how so many really great soldiers come to the service.

18:43.316 --> 18:43.757
That's true.

18:43.817 --> 18:45.720
It's almost like a foreign legion.

18:45.800 --> 18:50.727
Can you give us that image briefly?

18:51.196 --> 18:52.338
nowhere else to go.

18:52.358 --> 18:52.859
That's true.

18:53.540 --> 18:54.301
It really was.

18:54.441 --> 18:59.990
And in your particular case, I mean, school was washing out, and so what am I going to do now?

19:00.290 --> 19:00.571
Yeah.

19:00.791 --> 19:02.494
I was really at a loss when I went in.

19:02.634 --> 19:04.537
See, you never could have gotten into Navy OCS.

19:05.438 --> 19:07.562
I mean, the fact that you didn't have a college degree.

19:07.582 --> 19:07.822
Right.

19:08.223 --> 19:10.006
That's right.

19:10.046 --> 19:13.531
The Navy's very different in that.

19:13.571 --> 19:15.655
Half the guys in my section had master's degrees.

19:15.755 --> 19:17.237
I mean, it was like a

19:17.555 --> 19:19.198
It was safe.

19:19.398 --> 19:24.146
I said, I'm not going to deny that one.

19:24.166 --> 19:27.411
One of those PBRs.

19:27.491 --> 19:29.194
Well, yeah, that could have happened.

19:29.214 --> 19:38.128
I was a line officer, and though I had background in journalism, worked for a couple of papers, there were no guarantees.

19:38.598 --> 19:40.901
47 guys died in the Eryskine fire.

19:41.281 --> 19:41.842
Is that right?

19:41.862 --> 19:44.565
And four of whom happened to have been journalists.

19:44.685 --> 19:52.434
And, I mean, I used to, every day, live with the realization that two bodies were floating under, you know, where I had my desk.

19:52.454 --> 19:53.676
Don't you remember the Eryskine fire?

19:53.736 --> 19:54.076
Yes.

19:54.116 --> 19:55.398
You were over there, I guess.

19:55.458 --> 19:55.978
That was 67.

19:55.998 --> 19:56.399
Yep.

19:56.599 --> 19:57.860
Yep.

19:57.941 --> 19:58.641
And that happened.

19:58.681 --> 19:59.843
How did that come about?

20:00.163 --> 20:01.004
Stupidity.

20:01.965 --> 20:03.627
Maybe that's something you can say.

20:03.647 --> 20:07.812
Again, we're talking about this close friend of yours who had that death.

20:09.952 --> 20:12.075
Well, I don't know.

20:12.235 --> 20:15.819
I don't know.

20:18.622 --> 20:19.864
I don't know.

20:19.884 --> 20:20.585
I don't know.

20:20.705 --> 20:25.491
I don't know.

20:25.911 --> 20:29.115
I don't know.

20:29.315 --> 20:30.737
I don't know.

20:30.857 --> 20:33.400
I don't know.

20:33.701 --> 20:36.544
I don't know.

20:36.744 --> 20:39.047
I don't know.

20:39.415 --> 20:49.930
I mean, did you feel like you were kind of imposing on him, in a way?

20:49.990 --> 20:59.544
I don't think I was going to fit in, but I'm just curious.

20:59.564 --> 20:59.825
Yeah.

21:02.609 --> 21:08.477
Let's talk—I mean, you've written two memoirs now, and they carry you through

21:08.643 --> 21:09.484
at the age of 22.

21:09.544 --> 21:12.808
This is it.

21:13.849 --> 21:15.911
I'm at the end of this.

21:15.971 --> 21:19.435
Tim O'Brien told me he's all done writing, too, and I'll believe it when I see it.

21:19.455 --> 21:20.256
He's all done writing?

21:21.478 --> 21:22.539
That's what he said.

21:22.559 --> 21:24.701
Well, I'm not saying that.

21:24.742 --> 21:30.789
I understand that, but what I'm saying—he said this is it, but you're saying this is it for memoir.

21:31.369 --> 21:33.351
No, I understand precisely what you're saying.

21:33.512 --> 21:37.897
Anyway, Tim— What I'm doing is being— I don't believe Tim.

21:37.917 --> 21:38.177
Neither do I.

21:38.663 --> 21:39.845
He may have stopped for a while.

21:39.905 --> 21:46.336
He's got personal problems right now.

21:47.057 --> 21:51.164
I knew this is a new future now.

21:52.906 --> 21:58.596
I think that, you know, you're... You don't mind this kind of a dismissive... No, if you can make sense of the later... I do.

21:58.656 --> 21:59.097
Okay.

21:59.377 --> 21:59.738
I like it.

22:00.359 --> 22:05.447
No, I think your interview with...

22:05.630 --> 22:10.077
Tim O'Brien, in which he talks about rewriting Cacciano several years later.

22:10.237 --> 22:12.921
And also the things that Carrie's doing again, too.

22:13.181 --> 22:14.343
Oh, I wish you wouldn't see.

22:14.563 --> 22:17.668
I respect his motives.

22:17.688 --> 22:22.535
I don't have any problem with his motives in doing that, but I think that it's a mistake, and I'll tell you why.

22:22.595 --> 22:32.970
I think that, I mean, the famous example of a compulsive rewriter is Wordsworth, who goes back to the works of his youth and his old age.

22:34.300 --> 22:40.270
in his actually late middle years, through his old age, and he just destroyed them.

22:40.630 --> 22:41.512
He went back.

22:41.532 --> 22:46.159
Yeah, we have the earlier versions, and they're superior.

22:46.179 --> 22:49.224
He didn't destroy them in the sense that we still have the earlier versions.

22:49.244 --> 22:58.499
The thing you've got to remember is, I think, as a writer, that you are not the person you were when you wrote that book.

22:59.461 --> 23:01.624
That's precisely the words that Bill Kennedy used.

23:03.241 --> 23:04.984
That's exactly what she just said.

23:05.004 --> 23:06.746
And you have to respect that person.

23:06.826 --> 23:09.851
I think that you're second-guessing.

23:09.871 --> 23:31.864
You're imposing—I mean, it would be—it makes no more sense for me to go back now and rewrite something I wrote ten years ago than it would be for me to rewrite the work of a friend, because I have no more authority, moral authority, over that work now, I think, than I went over a friend's work.

23:32.047 --> 23:45.541
Whoever wrote that stuff had his own atmosphere of creation that he was inhabiting at the time, things that might not be really apparent to me right now, yet that a reader may very well discern.

23:46.542 --> 23:53.209
I may have lost the bond with that work, but it exists on its own terms.

23:53.589 --> 24:00.096
And to continually reimpose new terms on a work like that is –

24:00.599 --> 24:04.442
is unfair to both the work and the writer that you were when you wrote it.

24:05.844 --> 24:10.988
The very act of writing, the thing in the first place, has changed you and made you into a different person.

24:11.889 --> 24:18.815
I am a different person now, not just for the life I've lived, but for the work I've done.

24:19.275 --> 24:30.285
When I really am working at the top of my form, I am aware that I am seeing things differently, that there's an excitement that comes from

24:30.653 --> 24:40.627
I can think of no other word than revelation, that things are becoming clear to me that were not clear to me before, and that, for a human being, is change.

24:40.647 --> 24:44.352
When you see something clearly that you haven't seen before, it changes you.

24:44.972 --> 24:46.334
And you're not that person anymore.

24:46.374 --> 24:47.316
You can't go back.

24:47.876 --> 24:48.898
You can't walk backwards.

24:49.398 --> 24:52.202
See, this is relevant to the memoir, by the way, in a way.

24:52.222 --> 24:52.983
Yeah.

24:53.003 --> 24:53.584
I mean, in a way.

24:53.684 --> 24:53.925
Sure.

24:53.945 --> 24:55.286
In a reverse kind of way.

24:55.487 --> 24:55.767
Right.

24:56.337 --> 24:59.802
Had you tried to write this 20 years ago, it certainly would not be the book.

25:00.023 --> 25:00.684
No, it would not.

25:01.205 --> 25:09.057
If I wrote this book right now, if I wrote In Pharaoh's Army right now, it would be a different book than what I've written.

25:09.157 --> 25:15.446
Because I've, I mean, I just, there's no way I could tell that story that way again.

25:15.507 --> 25:22.277
That story not only belongs to the time in which it is set, but it also belongs to the time in which it was written.

25:22.915 --> 25:24.899
That's a great quote.

25:25.019 --> 25:26.642
I can't see where I'm going to use it.

25:26.662 --> 25:27.263
Go ahead.

25:27.303 --> 25:31.570
And the person who wrote it doesn't exist anymore, because that book changed him.

25:31.931 --> 25:34.456
There's probably an essay here for me.

25:34.476 --> 25:40.306
I mean, you know, you talk about Leaves of Grass.

25:40.366 --> 25:42.550
I mean, he was a doctor.

25:42.570 --> 25:43.612
That's a doctor.

25:43.632 --> 25:44.213
Absolutely.

25:44.233 --> 25:47.539
I mean, his whole life's mission was he did nine different rites.

25:47.620 --> 25:55.148
And of course then in the deathbed, the ninth one, is the one who has this supersedes and replaces all earlier versions.

25:55.168 --> 26:01.615
Henry James, when he was writing the prefaces, went in and fooled around a little bit with some of those things.

26:01.635 --> 26:02.956
To what degree, I can't say.

26:03.356 --> 26:05.519
I haven't read James Reader.

26:06.179 --> 26:09.983
But it is a very interesting, and maybe there's an essay there.

26:10.524 --> 26:11.425
Yeah.

26:11.445 --> 26:12.125
Now that's funny.

26:12.145 --> 26:13.687
With the prefaces, that's different.

26:13.987 --> 26:16.530
He also did go ahead and tinkle a little bit.

26:16.713 --> 26:23.783
If you have the New York edition, which I have, which I have a collector, I can tell, can appreciate.

26:23.803 --> 26:32.516
That's, you know, it really makes sense also to have, if you can get the first edition of the books, because they are basically very infinite in many respects.

26:32.536 --> 26:32.916
He did.

26:33.017 --> 26:35.801
While he was considering them and writing the prefaces, he did.

26:36.361 --> 26:37.623
He couldn't help himself.

26:37.723 --> 26:39.346
He went in and tinkered, you know.

26:40.167 --> 26:41.930
Well, Frank O'Connor would do that, too.

26:42.030 --> 26:44.653
I mean, you know, the great Irish short story, right?

26:44.674 --> 26:46.416
If you look at the ending, let's say,

26:46.835 --> 27:01.235
that story of his Guests of the Nation, in which the IRA, if you remember, shoot a couple of British soldiers that they've been holding hostage because some of their men are hung in Dublin.

27:01.615 --> 27:12.691
He changed the ending in different ways, tinkered with the wording, especially the last line, a few other things, and couldn't leave it alone, kept going back to it.

27:12.971 --> 27:15.154
You might say that he improved it, I don't know.

27:15.370 --> 27:22.461
I just think that, I think it's a mistake.

27:24.304 --> 27:38.948
But my thinking is obviously, I mean, I'm seeing the problem from my own lens, basically, and what, I respect Tim's

27:39.772 --> 27:54.933
You know how we get off on this, Tim and I get off on this, is that the P.W.

27:54.973 --> 28:00.922
Review was based on the first they sent out, you know, one of these fancy advanced readers copies.

28:02.204 --> 28:04.527
He's done two more since then.

28:04.547 --> 28:05.068
Two more?

28:05.388 --> 28:08.833
Two more.

28:09.590 --> 28:15.200
three different versions of the novel in advance of publication.

28:15.481 --> 28:16.683
And it's probably going to be changed.

28:16.783 --> 28:20.650
Mark, he's probably going to be doing this right up until the time they must launch it.

28:20.670 --> 28:21.391
When is it coming out?

28:21.792 --> 28:22.433
It's October.

28:22.533 --> 28:25.058
It's probably right around the same time as your book.

28:25.258 --> 28:27.462
I liked it, by the way.

28:27.502 --> 28:28.103
What is it called?

28:28.564 --> 28:30.588
It's called In the Lake of the Woods.

28:30.808 --> 28:33.032
In the Lake of the Woods, that's right.

28:33.198 --> 28:35.280
He uses a couple of devices.

28:35.300 --> 28:37.843
It's about a Minnesota politician, right?

28:37.863 --> 28:39.805
Yeah, but it's Vietnam.

28:39.825 --> 28:40.886
Yeah, he's formed there.

28:40.906 --> 28:44.129
And the reason I bring Tim in is there is a purpose.

28:44.429 --> 28:50.916
When I asked you about the event of your life and you're going there, I asked him if he had it to do over again.

28:50.976 --> 28:53.779
He said, I was a coward foregoing.

28:54.820 --> 28:56.261
I thought about not going.

28:56.281 --> 28:57.362
I never should have gone.

28:57.422 --> 29:00.285
He considers himself a coward foregoing.

29:01.008 --> 29:03.611
I mean, did you ever harbor any thoughts about not going?

29:03.671 --> 29:05.052
I mean, there was never any other thoughts?

29:05.073 --> 29:14.163
I know you discussed that scene in the San Francisco bar with your friend's father, where the guy is basically pleading for the two guys, don't go.

29:14.243 --> 29:16.285
I mean, I think that's essentially what he's saying.

29:16.305 --> 29:18.748
Yeah, that's right.

29:19.248 --> 29:29.800
I know exactly what Tim means, and I would have to say that something like that is true of me.

29:30.100 --> 29:31.262
It's a little different form.

29:31.302 --> 29:47.848
I think that from what I've read in Tim's work, say in the book, The Things They Carried, I know that that is fiction and that I'm not to understand that as a direct transcription of what happened to him.

29:48.610 --> 29:52.235
And he says that's the case, by the way.

29:52.335 --> 29:55.180
I know, I know, and he's right to say so.

29:56.206 --> 30:13.590
However, I do think that from that and other things I've read, my impression is that Tim had a certain outlook on the war before he went, that he had a certain sense that the war was morally indefensible, basically.

30:13.630 --> 30:15.512
I think he had a take on that before he went.

30:15.532 --> 30:16.193
I think so.

30:16.213 --> 30:16.794
I did not.

30:18.376 --> 30:22.602
That is pertinent, I think.

30:23.122 --> 30:26.366
Cowardice is too strong a word, I think, really.

30:26.867 --> 30:42.167
The form that my evasion took was that I simply did not interest myself too much in things that would lead me to that kind of a conclusion, because I knew in advance that I was going.

30:42.648 --> 30:44.771
I couldn't imagine an alternative to going.

30:45.291 --> 30:49.517
I mean, to me, first of all, to go to prison,

30:50.965 --> 30:56.292
to go to, I mean, that was, you've got to remember, my own man spent time in prison.

30:56.312 --> 30:58.755
That was, to me, the most shameful thing that could happen to anybody.

30:58.775 --> 31:04.323
I don't care, you know, now I have a sense in which I'm a different person now.

31:04.383 --> 31:16.700
When I see, you know, when I see Philip Berrigan going back to prison yet again, as he did in North Carolina, I mean, I think, what heroism, you know, what incredible heroism.

31:16.720 --> 31:20.044
I don't necessarily agree with all his positions on everything, but

31:20.446 --> 31:22.609
But I just think, I know he hates it.

31:22.629 --> 31:24.092
He just hates being in prison.

31:24.112 --> 31:24.953
It's very hard on him.

31:24.973 --> 31:36.051
If you read Francine de Pussick's grave's book, Civil Disobedience, which was published about 20 years ago, she's already talking about Berrigan and assault Berrigan and how hard prison is on him.

31:36.812 --> 31:37.493
And here he is.

31:37.513 --> 31:39.356
He's been back 10 times since.

31:39.657 --> 31:42.902
And it is just very, very hard on him.

31:42.942 --> 31:46.167
So there are ways, obviously, of approaching this experience.

31:46.754 --> 31:48.777
For one person, it's an act of heroism.

31:48.797 --> 31:50.860
For another, it's an act of cowardice.

31:52.582 --> 31:56.147
It depends on the moral equipment, I guess, that you bring to it.

31:56.227 --> 32:01.895
But for me, it was an unimaginable thing to go to prison or to go to Canada.

32:01.975 --> 32:02.856
I couldn't imagine it.

32:02.956 --> 32:04.098
I simply couldn't imagine it.

32:04.118 --> 32:09.505
And I mean, I belonged, for better or for worse, to a community of people.

32:10.126 --> 32:17.478
My community at the time was a community of soldiers, and it was just unthinkable among the soldiers I knew to do this.

32:18.019 --> 32:18.780
You were younger, too.

32:19.040 --> 32:20.442
I was younger, absolutely.

32:20.683 --> 32:23.708
You were there before me, and I'm older than you are.

32:25.190 --> 32:31.019
I went to OCS after graduate school, and I had things figured out.

32:31.039 --> 32:37.129
You didn't have things figured out.

32:37.548 --> 32:45.638
I mean, I'd get pretty close to being uncomfortable about it, and then I'd back off, you know.

32:46.079 --> 32:46.719
I'd back off.

32:46.840 --> 32:48.742
I'd kind of just shut down a little bit.

32:50.144 --> 33:00.056
I was curious enough, finally, when I found myself for that year that I was in Washington, talking to people who really knew a lot about it.

33:01.598 --> 33:02.960
You know, like I met I.F.

33:02.980 --> 33:04.101
Stone.

33:05.062 --> 33:05.783
I'm surprised by my favorite.

33:07.906 --> 33:10.370
Well, I was already in the service.

33:10.510 --> 33:12.253
I was already in the service.

33:12.273 --> 33:13.435
That's the thing, see.

33:14.416 --> 33:22.929
And he certainly made me aware that there were questions to be asked about my condition.

33:22.949 --> 33:29.980
And he asked him, and he was very, very, you know, he recognized he had a baby on his hands, and he did not tear me apart.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.985
I mean, but he just asked me questions that I knew.

33:33.235 --> 33:44.734
that he knew I couldn't answer, and in a way that I needed to answer to make this thing a crusade that is the only justification for being in a war like that.

33:46.377 --> 33:56.273
So he really made me very uncomfortable, and sort of this fantastic professor whose classes I went to sometimes at Georgetown, out of interest.

34:01.045 --> 34:03.428
a professor at Georgetown.

34:04.549 --> 34:20.308
And the books I was reading, you know, Lucien Bedard and especially Bernard Fall and Graham Greene, I mean, this wasn't quite as simple a deal as the Army had made it out to be, you know.

34:20.908 --> 34:27.576
And as our president, you know, I was – the people I grew up with in Washington State, very blue-collar, working-class people,

34:28.130 --> 34:32.235
And the guys my mom went out with, they're all veterans.

34:32.255 --> 34:33.837
They'd all fought in World War II.

34:34.157 --> 34:42.386
They took, you know, you never heard anything, any criticism about the House on American Activities Commission from those people.

34:42.527 --> 34:49.355
In fact, you know, when the newsreels, when we'd go to movie theaters and the newsreels would show that, you know, the U.S.

34:49.435 --> 34:54.120
Marshals hosing down the steps of the Congress, you know,

34:57.155 --> 35:03.801
Everybody would cheer, and I would too, because it was really a very dualistic world that I grew up in.

35:04.522 --> 35:06.663
And the idea of doubting the president?

35:07.644 --> 35:09.826
I mean, who are you to doubt your president?

35:09.866 --> 35:13.449
How much do you know that you can doubt your president and your government?

35:14.831 --> 35:25.440
And that is one of the ways in which Vietnam was to signal an event, is that it turned a nation of believers into a nation of cynics.

35:26.163 --> 35:36.453
after 10 years, 12 years of being systematically lied to, and your first instinct now is to distrust always and to question the motives.

35:39.976 --> 35:42.458
It isn't necessarily true anymore that you think they know better.

35:42.959 --> 35:50.166
Let's talk a bit—again, let's go back to the memoir here—and you say this is it.

35:50.366 --> 35:52.828
Oh, absolutely, this is it.

35:53.500 --> 35:56.304
I don't have much of interest to report.

35:56.604 --> 36:00.410
Well, I mean, a question I have here is, have you lived an eventful life?

36:00.650 --> 36:06.518
Obviously, prior to the age of 22 you have, and I'm not— I lived—let me put it this way.

36:06.579 --> 36:10.023
Eventful in terms of worth writing a memoir?

36:10.063 --> 36:10.424
No.

36:10.524 --> 36:11.706
No, I think not.

36:12.126 --> 36:22.461
I think that in the most—in the profoundest sense, it has been an eventful life since then.

36:23.032 --> 36:26.156
And probably the most meaningful they were, too.

36:26.176 --> 36:26.257
Yes.

36:26.277 --> 36:26.457
Oh, yeah.

36:26.477 --> 36:30.443
The things that the rest of my life are made out of and have happened since then.

36:31.885 --> 36:34.929
This could be a key quote, though, so we'll play with this for a while.

36:35.229 --> 36:35.350
Yeah.

36:35.370 --> 36:44.583
Because maybe there is a dichotomy in your life that you've covered in the two memoirs and the more satisfying events that may have come afterwards.

36:44.663 --> 36:52.414
I think what the two books in a different way show is someone who's unformed.

36:53.542 --> 37:10.188
trying to find a form, trying to find a place in the world, trying to find some idea of who he is, how he fits in, what he's supposed to do, and is propelled by those questions on a field of action.

37:12.011 --> 37:14.615
He moves a lot.

37:14.695 --> 37:15.897
He's doing things.

37:15.917 --> 37:21.405
They're active, and the things that happen to him are consequential and even dangerous.

37:22.381 --> 37:35.337
The story since then has to do with coming to terms with those questions, finding the answers to them, and accepting the answers once they begin to come to him.

37:35.938 --> 37:42.446
And those are inwardly exciting times.

37:42.466 --> 37:50.937
They don't necessarily lend themselves to the same excitement and narrative treatment that these earlier memoirs do.

37:51.457 --> 37:53.981
And the person is at hazard in different ways.

37:54.141 --> 38:00.832
I mean, I haven't been physically at hazard in a year since.

38:03.175 --> 38:19.000
In a sense, I've had the more serious problems that everyone faces of somehow bringing home the bacon and making a life for a family.

38:19.452 --> 38:33.452
learning to stay put after a lifetime of wandering, learning to be with one person when I've obviously not been used to that, and working out the problems of a marriage and being a father.

38:33.653 --> 38:36.637
Those are the really tough problems.

38:36.717 --> 38:47.012
And I do write about them, but I tend to write about them

38:47.448 --> 38:55.738
They tend to find their way more into my short stories than in memoir form.

38:55.758 --> 39:03.568
This, in Pharaoh's army, could not have legally been called this man's life.

39:03.588 --> 39:04.829
No.

39:05.049 --> 39:08.794
He's still, yeah, he's still something less than a man, something more than a boy.

39:09.515 --> 39:15.362
He's caught in some ghostly half-country there, some no-man's land of...

39:15.865 --> 39:19.010
of life, which is what the Army does.

39:19.110 --> 39:21.354
It postpones it.

39:21.374 --> 39:33.634
You talk about going to the Army and becoming a man, but it really defers that tremendously, because the thing that makes you a man is assuming responsibility for your own life, and the Army really does take care of all that for you.

39:33.694 --> 39:40.284
I mean, all the things that make life very difficult for people on the outside are taken care of on the inside.

39:40.385 --> 39:41.607
You never go hungry.

39:41.647 --> 39:41.907
That's right.

39:42.292 --> 39:43.877
You'll always have a roof over your head.

39:44.017 --> 39:47.588
Someone will always be telling you what you should do, when you should do it, what you should wear.

39:47.629 --> 39:49.153
They'll get your laundry done for you.

39:49.394 --> 39:51.019
They'll get your shopping done for you.

39:51.151 --> 39:54.795
You don't have to worry about it.

39:55.176 --> 39:57.799
It's a really cushy life, actually.

39:58.059 --> 40:05.488
They like to make it sound like it's a sacrifice and a really tough life, but the truth is the military life is extremely cushy.

40:05.508 --> 40:08.532
You certainly have a chance of getting your ass cut.

40:08.552 --> 40:09.814
That's the downside.

40:09.874 --> 40:10.875
That's the downside.

40:10.975 --> 40:19.085
But again, think how many of the people in the service actually are at risk.

40:19.506 --> 40:19.926
Oh, yeah.

40:20.108 --> 40:21.150
Very few, really.

40:21.310 --> 40:27.379
I mean, half a million people at any given time over there.

40:27.419 --> 40:33.268
The odds of people getting killed, never mind even getting killed, seeing action was, you know, remote.

40:33.368 --> 40:35.651
Yeah, it was.

40:35.812 --> 40:40.218
And then they'd be the same people over and over and over and over and over again.

40:40.238 --> 40:48.090
I'd like to say that your Swarthines are good.

40:48.425 --> 40:53.053
I recall, again, through the prism of memory, I recall the salient detail.

40:55.196 --> 40:59.183
I really do read this.

40:59.223 --> 41:11.262
This is also the event of my lifetime, too, so I was very pleased that my man would still have a lot to do here.

41:11.282 --> 41:14.668
Is there a seamlessness between the two memoirs in your mind?

41:15.593 --> 41:34.219
No, oddly enough, you know, it's funny that when my brother read the book, this last one, he said, he said, it really feels like a different book than the last one, you know?

41:34.239 --> 41:40.067
He said, you know, he was surprised by how little like the last one it felt to him.

41:41.168 --> 41:44.773
I don't know whether other readers will respond that way, but

41:47.555 --> 41:49.157
I think that's probably true.

41:49.337 --> 41:50.678
I don't think there's a seamlessness.

41:50.719 --> 42:00.009
I was really a pretty different person in this book, just on the superficial level of... You didn't intend it to be a bookend, let's put it that way.

42:00.029 --> 42:01.290
No, no, no, no.

42:01.330 --> 42:02.331
It's not a sequel, no.

42:03.152 --> 42:05.415
I didn't think of it as a sequel, obviously.

42:05.435 --> 42:08.859
There's no way to avoid anybody else seeing it that way.

42:09.900 --> 42:15.486
But, no, I saw it as very much a kind of independent book about...

42:16.158 --> 42:20.144
What happens to somebody under these circumstances?

42:20.545 --> 42:38.351
The kind of moral transformations that take place with lasting effects when somebody finds himself in this situation, when somebody is sent to war.

42:38.672 --> 42:41.376
What happens?

42:42.518 --> 42:44.781
Actually, we're having a hard ground here.

42:45.115 --> 42:55.150
You apparently tried Matthew Falls, Stardustead writing, but it was a writer of your life, I hope.

42:56.553 --> 43:07.129
You know, you fooled around with it prior to going overseas, and then I guess you made some half-hearted attempts while you were there.

43:09.232 --> 43:11.916
Tell me a little bit about that, and then I guess also

43:12.622 --> 43:19.251
When you discovered that you could be a writer and that you were a writer, again, this is what Pete Everett did.

43:19.351 --> 43:22.715
Sure, we do want to get into the evolution of the writer, I guess.

43:22.896 --> 43:23.176
Sure.

43:23.637 --> 43:24.498
Well, that's fine.

43:24.578 --> 43:25.880
I'm happy to talk about that.

43:28.083 --> 43:33.410
By the time I was 16, I knew I wanted to be a writer.

43:34.151 --> 43:36.273
How did you know this?

43:36.293 --> 43:42.021
Partly, it was a process of elimination in that I wasn't good at anything else at all.

43:42.592 --> 43:50.221
And, you know, of course, I was very gratified to have my brother encourage me before I went off to this boarding school.

43:50.662 --> 44:02.335
But I was also well aware that he was my brother and that one's family is perhaps more apt to encourage you than— What's the age difference, once again, between Jeffrey?

44:02.516 --> 44:03.377
Seven and a half years.

44:04.158 --> 44:05.359
And he just graduated.

44:09.625 --> 44:23.577
But when I got off to school, I had a very bumpy start, even in my English class.

44:23.757 --> 44:30.643
But I had a teacher there who really, really fired me up.

44:30.663 --> 44:35.768
I keep going, just making sure I'm not missing anything.

44:35.788 --> 44:39.531
I was just in love with literature.

44:39.950 --> 44:43.634
and with language, but not in a promiscuous way.

44:43.654 --> 44:45.697
I mean, he didn't love every word he ever met.

44:45.997 --> 44:50.482
He was very, very—how can I put it?

44:50.502 --> 44:54.327
He was very Senecan in his practical language.

44:55.368 --> 44:59.333
He was the right words in the right place, you know, and not a word more.

44:59.713 --> 45:01.635
And every comma mattered to him.

45:02.256 --> 45:07.442
So when I first got there, I'd get my papers back.

45:11.877 --> 45:17.081
Well, they didn't have shredders, but they looked like blood had been poured on them.

45:17.161 --> 45:18.523
There was so much red ink on them.

45:18.983 --> 45:20.024
They looked murdered.

45:21.065 --> 45:32.514
And it was a little disheartening at first, but I just somehow knew that this was where, you know, I could take the hit in biology and algebra and all that.

45:32.715 --> 45:38.279
Though I did badly in those subjects, I thought, this isn't going to be my life.

45:38.479 --> 45:41.462
But boy, when I got those things back, I thought,

45:41.797 --> 45:42.939
I got to get this right.

45:44.180 --> 45:50.009
I paid attention to him, and I'd go through my essays, and I'd rewrite them.

45:51.972 --> 46:09.778
And I learned so much from him about what is essential and exact in language, and just the most obvious things, like avoiding the irresponsible passive voice, the mistake

46:11.581 --> 46:13.724
you know, the political voice.

46:13.785 --> 46:16.449
He was big on Orwell.

46:16.469 --> 46:18.993
He had me read Orwell's essays on language.

46:19.834 --> 46:27.526
And he was just an extraordinary influence and an encouragement, because when I did something right, he'd lead me along.

46:27.607 --> 46:33.195
And after a year with him, I was just on a course, really.

46:33.736 --> 46:37.943
And he'd invite me over and talk to some folks.

46:38.615 --> 46:49.768
And so the love I already had when I arrived there was just exponentially increased, and also a sense of confidence, finally, because it gave me a sense of control over language that I'd never had before.

46:50.909 --> 46:53.031
And I did well in my next year there.

46:53.071 --> 47:01.781
I felt almost everything else except history, and they acted up and all the stuff that they had to let go of me, for which I do not blame them.

47:02.562 --> 47:07.828
But, you know, I was...

47:08.467 --> 47:16.656
I was already someone with an ambition to be a writer by the time I left, and I couldn't really imagine being anything else.

47:16.676 --> 47:17.296
A fiction writer, I mean.

47:17.316 --> 47:17.917
Yeah, a fiction writer.

47:17.937 --> 47:21.301
I wanted to be a novelist and a poet.

47:21.321 --> 47:22.382
I wrote a lot of poetry.

47:23.703 --> 47:26.466
Did you publish any of poetry?

47:26.486 --> 47:27.928
Just in school literary magazines.

47:28.728 --> 47:30.130
In school literary magazines.

47:30.150 --> 47:30.610
No, no, no.

47:30.670 --> 47:35.976
I mean, I was, what, 18 when I left, I guess.

47:36.344 --> 47:38.508
But I wrote even when I was in the Army.

47:38.588 --> 47:44.839
I kept writing when there were lulls in the training, when I'd be in garrison, that kind of thing.

47:44.939 --> 47:46.802
I tried to write, usually poetry.

47:48.104 --> 47:55.096
And then the year that I was in Washington in language school, I really sat down and tried to write a novel.

47:56.118 --> 47:57.881
And I got along pretty well in it.

47:57.961 --> 48:01.187
I mean, it probably wasn't very good.

48:01.505 --> 48:04.249
There's no trace of it left now.

48:04.269 --> 48:04.730
I burned it.

48:04.890 --> 48:05.411
I burned it.

48:05.431 --> 48:05.611
Really?

48:05.692 --> 48:07.595
Oh, yeah, I actually burned it.

48:07.635 --> 48:09.177
Oh, yeah, I physically destroyed it.

48:09.217 --> 48:09.598
Why?

48:09.618 --> 48:10.379
Because I hated it.

48:10.900 --> 48:11.340
I hated it.

48:11.360 --> 48:12.082
I came to hate it.

48:12.182 --> 48:14.746
You don't want anybody reading it 50 years from now.

48:14.766 --> 48:15.146
I can't.

48:15.166 --> 48:15.908
It doesn't exist.

48:16.028 --> 48:19.333
I mean, but... I just hated it as an object.

48:19.453 --> 48:24.441
I burned it when I was in Vietnam, as a matter of fact.

48:24.461 --> 48:27.746
I just poured a bunch of gasoline on it one day and burned it, absolutely.

48:27.766 --> 48:28.728
Where is this?

48:28.748 --> 48:29.689
Where was it from now?

48:30.192 --> 48:32.534
It was in that little place I talk about.

48:32.594 --> 48:34.776
Were you tricking that knife or what?

48:34.796 --> 48:37.999
I don't remember what led me to do it, but it was just sitting there.

48:38.059 --> 48:39.100
I wasn't working on it.

48:39.160 --> 48:42.844
It became a very reproachful present, but I hated it.

48:42.904 --> 48:44.765
I really couldn't stand reading it.

48:44.825 --> 48:46.127
Frustration, partly.

48:46.167 --> 48:48.068
Were you losing the touch?

48:48.108 --> 48:49.069
Yeah, yeah.

48:49.089 --> 48:51.171
I maybe thought I'd never be able to do it again.

48:51.191 --> 48:58.478
I don't remember what my frame of mind was, but mostly I remember it was just basically detestation.

48:59.673 --> 49:02.836
But when I got back… Tell me physically and what you did.

49:02.856 --> 49:03.337
You burned it?

49:03.357 --> 49:03.597
Yeah.

49:03.798 --> 49:05.359
Poured gasoline on it and burned it.

49:06.060 --> 49:06.621
Outside?

49:06.741 --> 49:07.401
Outside.

49:07.802 --> 49:08.543
Outside.

49:08.783 --> 49:09.464
In a trash heap.

49:09.484 --> 49:10.925
We used to burn our trash out back.

49:10.985 --> 49:11.666
I just took it out there.

49:11.686 --> 49:13.468
Did you tell anybody what you were doing or just doing it?

49:13.488 --> 49:14.169
Yeah, I just did it.

49:14.189 --> 49:15.030
I mean, you know.

49:17.092 --> 49:21.417
It wasn't of interest to the guy I was serving with.

49:24.300 --> 49:25.942
Have you been in touch with him, by the way?

49:25.962 --> 49:26.102
No.

49:29.744 --> 49:31.746
He seems like a first-class guy.

49:32.146 --> 49:33.628
He was a great guy.

49:33.648 --> 49:34.388
He was a great guy.

49:34.509 --> 49:37.732
The kind of guy you'd like to know what he's been up to or how he's doing.

49:37.752 --> 49:39.113
No idea what he would.

49:39.493 --> 49:39.614
No.

49:39.634 --> 49:42.176
Is that his actual name or did you change names?

49:42.196 --> 49:42.256
No.

49:42.276 --> 49:43.417
Changed names.

49:43.437 --> 49:44.959
Changed names.

49:45.019 --> 49:47.681
And the friend that was killed, was that his actual name?

49:49.163 --> 49:49.303
No.

49:49.323 --> 49:49.403
No.

49:49.423 --> 49:50.204
You did change names.

49:50.224 --> 49:50.904
Oh, you bet I did.

49:50.924 --> 49:54.408
I've changed almost everybody's name but my own, my family's.

49:56.530 --> 49:58.772
There's no reason for

49:59.832 --> 50:14.470
just off the record for a moment here, in his particular case, I would have used, he was killed 28 years ago.

50:14.730 --> 50:25.503
They might not appreciate hearing that, you know, at this forget the child, I mean, that, you know, he was running around getting drunk and screwing girls in town and all that.

50:25.523 --> 50:26.464
They probably know it.

50:27.220 --> 50:29.704
at some level, but they don't need to hear that now.

50:29.724 --> 50:36.235
To have it documented in what would probably be the only time that the son is going to get his name in today.

50:36.255 --> 50:39.741
Kind of an archival document.

50:40.062 --> 50:40.322
Right.

50:40.803 --> 50:45.511
I mean, he was just a great guy, but he was a kid like me.

50:47.575 --> 50:49.839
Well, we had a wonderful time together, and we really did.

50:50.279 --> 50:51.321
He was a wonderful guy.

50:52.010 --> 51:00.858
But, no, I didn't see any point at all, and there was no reason to use his name, just as there was no reason to use the name of my ex-fiancé, for example.

51:00.878 --> 51:03.641
It could only cause pain for her.

51:03.661 --> 51:04.482
She's married now.

51:05.222 --> 51:06.363
She doesn't need to know.

51:06.383 --> 51:11.288
Apparently, she's resolved her psychological emotional problem.

51:11.308 --> 51:12.489
No, I don't think she has.

51:12.509 --> 51:13.850
Well, here's a piece of work for you.

51:14.271 --> 51:21.898
I mean, not for the record, but I mean.

51:22.925 --> 51:23.947
It was something.

51:23.967 --> 51:24.968
I think she still is.

51:25.048 --> 51:26.811
I know people who know her.

51:26.831 --> 51:28.414
We don't have to get into that.

51:28.574 --> 51:29.375
Yeah.

51:29.536 --> 51:30.197
She's pretty young.

51:30.217 --> 51:32.260
Again, I want to get back to the writing.

51:32.280 --> 51:32.941
So you destroyed it.

51:33.001 --> 51:33.923
You burned.

51:33.943 --> 51:36.306
I mean, this was a symbolic act as much as anything else.

51:36.326 --> 51:36.547
Yeah.

51:36.807 --> 51:37.829
But it was, I mean.

51:38.350 --> 51:42.817
Committing to the flames is something quite final about that.

51:42.837 --> 51:42.937
Yeah.

51:43.257 --> 51:47.584
I really did hate the book by the time I did that.

51:48.145 --> 51:50.569
And you didn't really seem to tell us what it was about, I guess.

51:51.157 --> 51:53.499
I thought that was kind of beside the point, really.

51:53.820 --> 51:59.626
I mean, there would have been a digression there that I didn't really think was necessary.

52:00.086 --> 52:18.885
Then I started another novel, and when I got back, I mean, I knew, I still knew, even though, you know, that I'd had a hard time writing or even reading while I was in Vietnam, I still knew that was what I wanted to do with my life.

52:20.468 --> 52:22.691
And it was very hard to get started again.

52:22.931 --> 52:24.453
It was really, really hard.

52:24.793 --> 52:35.846
But as I describe at the end of the book, I managed to carve a place out for myself at the place I was living, and at a time in the day, and I'd go and write.

52:36.006 --> 52:44.996
And I could tell at the end of the day, reading all of this stuff, that it wasn't that great, but I also knew that I needed to do it in order to ever write well, that I needed to get through there.

52:45.036 --> 52:47.379
Yeah, you were trying to write a novel?

52:47.399 --> 52:48.380
Yeah, yeah.

52:48.400 --> 52:49.902
I was trying to write a novel.

52:50.320 --> 52:53.564
I was trying to write it all about Vietnam and using the events.

52:54.865 --> 52:55.626
But I couldn't.

52:55.646 --> 52:56.868
It was just too costly.

52:56.888 --> 52:57.889
You're at Oxford now?

52:57.909 --> 52:58.329
No.

52:58.389 --> 52:59.290
Well, yeah.

52:59.851 --> 53:01.833
Partly while I was at Oxford.

53:02.114 --> 53:13.327
And partly when I first got back when I was living with my fiancee in Maryland.

53:14.228 --> 53:17.552
But when I got to Oxford, I continued to write.

53:17.572 --> 53:18.673
I'd write, you know,

53:19.025 --> 53:25.072
The studies there were very demanding and absorbing, but I managed to write at least two and a half or three hours every day.

53:25.092 --> 53:27.334
I wrote fiction.

53:27.354 --> 53:30.898
Yeah, I wrote a couple of novels during the years that I was there.

53:31.539 --> 53:32.320
They weren't very good.

53:33.060 --> 53:34.943
What were the years, basically?

53:34.963 --> 53:36.805
68 to 72.

53:37.145 --> 53:39.207
They weren't very good, but I kept writing.

53:39.287 --> 53:43.832
I got a job briefly at the Washington Post when I got it back in 1972.

53:43.952 --> 53:44.853
Reporter?

53:44.873 --> 53:47.296
Yeah, general assignment reporter.

53:48.037 --> 53:48.137
City?

53:48.573 --> 53:49.454
City beat.

53:49.474 --> 53:54.242
Yeah, mostly police beat, City Hall, real low-level stuff.

53:54.382 --> 53:57.607
You could have been in that Watergate thing.

53:57.627 --> 53:57.828
Oh, yeah.

53:57.868 --> 53:59.590
In fact, Carl Bernstein's a friend of mine.

53:59.650 --> 54:02.154
I mean, the luck of the draw.

54:02.194 --> 54:05.439
Luck of the draw, absolutely.

54:05.860 --> 54:07.563
It could have been you over there.

54:07.583 --> 54:11.509
It's a good thing it wasn't, because I was such a lousy reporter.

54:13.565 --> 54:17.130
that Nixon would probably still be president.

54:17.210 --> 54:18.872
Never would have broken the story.

54:19.252 --> 54:20.554
Never would have broken it?

54:20.574 --> 54:20.754
No.

54:21.095 --> 54:23.958
I found it hard to ask people really searching questions.

54:24.539 --> 54:25.881
I'd get shy about it.

54:26.081 --> 54:28.144
You have to.

54:28.204 --> 54:29.045
You have to.

54:29.385 --> 54:37.636
My wife gets mad at me sometimes because when I'm working, I'll ask anything if it's relevant.

54:38.477 --> 54:39.538
Better not to answer, right?

54:40.413 --> 54:43.516
I never hold it against a person who doesn't want to talk to a writer.

54:44.197 --> 54:49.802
John Updike has never accepted one of my invitations to be interviewed, and he doesn't give many.

54:50.203 --> 54:51.384
And that's cool.

54:51.524 --> 54:53.025
I thoroughly respect that.

54:53.045 --> 54:54.667
I don't think I've ever read an interview with him.

54:55.308 --> 54:59.192
He's done a couple, you know, and it's what it's mattered.

54:59.212 --> 55:00.473
I mean, it's Time Magazine.

55:00.493 --> 55:03.456
He did something with the BBC once, which was good.

55:03.656 --> 55:06.279
And then Tyler has never given any so far as I know.

55:06.299 --> 55:06.859
Is that right?

55:06.979 --> 55:07.720
Interesting.

55:07.885 --> 55:16.099
But even when you're working as a journalist and you're asking questions, I mean, there's nothing that's written that you have to talk to a writer, a reporter.

55:18.142 --> 55:18.423
Don't.

55:18.703 --> 55:20.226
Just don't.

55:20.246 --> 55:24.934
But the question sometimes has to be asked, as long as it's relevant.

55:25.575 --> 55:33.268
I'm going to turn this on to my side.
