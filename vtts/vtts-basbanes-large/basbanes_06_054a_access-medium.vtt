WEBVTT

00:02.714 --> 00:04.337
Okay, I'm on.

00:06.200 --> 00:08.063
Well, let's start straight away.

00:08.083 --> 00:09.265
You had mentioned something to me.

00:09.305 --> 00:15.034
I'm very interested in Hayden O'Moore, and you described him as a comet across the sky.

00:16.236 --> 00:23.828
And I'm understanding, of course, that I'm talking to a lot of people on the record, too, so you're not alone in the wilderness.

00:24.398 --> 00:27.361
This is not an unknown phenomenon in any field of collectors.

00:27.681 --> 00:30.084
It's somebody who comes, makes a big splash.

00:31.025 --> 00:37.991
Look, it's not an unknown in any field of collectors.

00:38.011 --> 00:40.314
Somebody comes in with a lot of money, makes a big splash.

00:40.774 --> 00:43.177
All these guys are from the savings and loans.

00:43.197 --> 00:43.937
They're the same thing.

00:44.017 --> 00:51.805
Now, the only difference between this guy, Paul, in Florida... I'm way ahead of you.

00:52.185 --> 00:53.747
This guy, Paul, in Florida...

00:54.318 --> 01:04.230
Affected the market the same way that haven't more did the fact that Gabe that that Paul is a is a How did he affect the market if you only collected magic in magic?

01:04.250 --> 01:05.792
I mean, I hate the wall.

01:05.812 --> 01:06.493
It's like the books.

01:06.513 --> 01:16.025
Well, I'm saying You've got two different people mixed up California is not Paul.

01:16.045 --> 01:16.386
I'm sorry.

01:16.406 --> 01:17.507
The guy in California is Ruben

01:17.977 --> 01:21.181
Okay, there's a Florida, it's called First Bank Corp, Florida.

01:21.301 --> 01:22.343
I don't know about this case?

01:22.843 --> 01:26.288
It has nothing, it has, it has only peripherally to do with books.

01:26.448 --> 01:29.332
I'm saying in all fields of collecting.

01:30.373 --> 01:35.420
Okay, Haven O'Moore happened to be a highly intelligent man who had a very specific goal in mind.

01:35.920 --> 01:40.907
But the effect on the market has nothing to do what his objective or intelligence or his background is.

01:41.087 --> 01:44.912
There's a guy came in with a ton of money, collected for 10 years, and then disappeared.

01:45.601 --> 01:58.897
Now, the fact that a guy in Florida or in California or in Alaska did the same thing, but did it for dishonest purposes or did it, okay, doesn't matter the net effect on the market, whether it's the book market or the stamp market or the furniture market, is the same thing.

01:59.158 --> 02:00.840
And this has happened over the centuries.

02:00.900 --> 02:15.017
You could probably go back and find case after case of people who've come in like a comet, you know, $6 million, $10 million in the book market is an enormous amount of money if that's spent over a short period of time.

02:15.419 --> 02:18.482
Haven, did he come here himself, or did he buy through agents?

02:18.582 --> 02:22.646
No, originally he came here himself, and then he got too big for his britches, too big for swan.

02:23.006 --> 02:24.087
He started buying at swan.

02:24.948 --> 02:25.289
I knew him.

02:25.689 --> 02:27.331
What kinds of things did he buy?

02:28.352 --> 02:31.955
Very fine, very early, very esoteric books.

02:31.975 --> 02:36.660
He was not a, I mean, he knew, in a sense, he knew what he was doing.

02:36.680 --> 02:41.504
He was buying superb copies, paying top dollar for superb material, not all of it very obvious.

02:41.524 --> 02:45.308
I mean, you know, esoteric material, arcane material, obscure material,

02:45.659 --> 02:46.420
but always the best.

02:48.463 --> 02:50.365
Can you give me a rough idea of when this might have been?

02:50.966 --> 02:51.647
I really can't.

02:51.687 --> 02:55.412
I would guess in the 72, 73, something like that.

02:55.773 --> 02:57.796
It was not too long after I took over Swan.

02:57.836 --> 03:00.259
I was so impressed.

03:00.319 --> 03:02.662
I mean, I was three or four years as head of Swan.

03:02.983 --> 03:10.293
This guy comes in with his glamorous wife, and he's buying all these books that I've cured you with in here sometimes.

03:11.214 --> 03:12.175
Did you talk so much?

03:12.296 --> 03:12.696
Sure.

03:12.716 --> 03:14.098
What was your impression of it?

03:14.599 --> 03:15.480
Weird, you know.

03:15.865 --> 03:41.704
just a weird guy but look we we were at a uh this is off the record now we were at a uh that's all right we were at a party the other day we went we went to a party the other day and we met the head of the uh american manuscripts department at 70s she's terrific but she's a weird lady so i you can't you can't make a judgment about somebody's it's the kind of person that i find difficult to talk to at a party so you meet somebody in here

03:42.005 --> 03:43.006
We can go back.

03:43.026 --> 03:44.308
You meet Haven O'Moorn here.

03:44.648 --> 03:45.489
He's a strange guy.

03:45.969 --> 03:48.652
You know, the fact that he's a strange guy doesn't mean anything coming from me.

03:49.033 --> 03:51.435
You said last time, though, he scared you almost.

03:52.236 --> 04:04.189
Well, it was... And I don't mean that you were... No, no, no, but you're... Scared in a sense that... You get scared because here you're dealing with somebody and you have no idea what's going through his head.

04:04.209 --> 04:11.337
It's like somebody coming into a shoe store and you're trying to sell him a pair of shoes and he's talking about...

04:11.806 --> 04:12.987
how leather is manufactured.

04:13.248 --> 04:16.091
He won't tell you what he wants, blue shoes or brown shoes.

04:16.171 --> 04:17.913
He sort of wishes you weren't there.

04:18.194 --> 04:22.238
It's that kind of a weirdness, you know, which is sort of otherworldly.

04:22.258 --> 04:24.922
Did he generally buy what he wanted?

04:25.202 --> 04:27.084
Oh, yeah, I always wanted.

04:27.144 --> 04:30.168
I mean, very rarely was he the undercutter.

04:30.488 --> 04:31.930
I'm not asking for specifics.

04:31.950 --> 04:32.891
It's a long time ago.

04:34.213 --> 04:34.854
He came to buy.

04:34.934 --> 04:36.295
He didn't come to shop.

04:36.315 --> 04:36.936
He came to buy.

04:37.591 --> 04:42.298
I'm wondering if he was buying books at that time for the garden collection, which is, you know, 314 lots.

04:42.318 --> 04:45.522
This was his own collection.

04:45.542 --> 04:51.030
I suppose we could go over what he bought from us and go over the garden sale and match it up.

04:51.851 --> 04:53.193
Do you have stuff in the gardens?

04:53.353 --> 04:54.315
I'm almost sure we did.

04:54.455 --> 05:00.684
I know I was a little bit put out because in the introduction or in the provenance, Swan Galleries was not mentioned.

05:00.704 --> 05:02.907
But I saw at least one book that he bought from us.

05:03.443 --> 05:06.886
And, you know, they may have traded up also.

05:06.906 --> 05:09.508
So he may have bought things from us and traded them up over the years.

05:09.748 --> 05:12.310
Yeah, and he really wasn't buying an option after a while.

05:12.331 --> 05:17.395
He was buying from Fleming and Colin Franklin and... Yeah.

05:17.415 --> 05:27.263
But, you know, you're going to end up with the same problem that I'm having is you're trying to... I think you're trying to get a handle on somebody who's otherworldly, who doesn't bear any weight.

05:27.283 --> 05:28.004
He's not even around.

05:28.064 --> 05:30.746
I mean, I could talk to his wife last week, which is extraordinary.

05:31.066 --> 05:33.028
You're trying to get... You can't get an interview with him?

05:33.498 --> 05:38.907
He said he's having therapy someplace.

05:40.810 --> 05:42.032
That's off the record.

05:42.152 --> 05:48.282
If I went back over the history of Swan, I've been here now for about 22 years.

05:48.422 --> 05:54.773
If I went back over the history of Swan, there's probably a dozen people that are characters in one way or another.

05:55.053 --> 05:56.215
Homor is just another character.

05:56.448 --> 06:24.632
how about you you had mentioned coke for instance there's another one here who influenced the market yeah he was a comic and and and getting now he sold everything off he's got it you know but when he came he didn't fill some market to the extent that people were actually orchestrating sales to appeal to him now i was here about a month ago and he said talk to you in a month about carl lube uh what's going to happen what's happening there uh it's a very it's a very for the moment it's a mixed up situation uh

06:27.160 --> 06:30.425
You go to the morgue.

06:30.465 --> 06:34.711
There was an article in the L.A.

06:34.732 --> 06:35.593
Times.

06:35.613 --> 06:37.616
No, that sounds different.

06:37.636 --> 06:39.639
There was an article in the L.A.

06:39.659 --> 06:41.922
Times within the past week, I believe.

06:42.383 --> 06:43.545
All about the situation.

06:44.266 --> 06:45.688
And in fact, I have a calling to the Times.

06:45.728 --> 06:47.331
I'm trying to call the reporter.

06:48.212 --> 06:52.038
And what the Resolution Trust... You know the story.

06:52.058 --> 06:54.822
It's now in the hands of the RTC.

06:55.038 --> 06:58.584
Well, the Mulholland collection is now in the hands of the RTC.

06:58.924 --> 07:03.271
The RTC went out and solicited bids on how to dispose of the collection.

07:03.832 --> 07:04.834
We've submitted a bid.

07:05.154 --> 07:10.543
We've submitted a bid and gave a complete outline of how to dispose of the collection.

07:11.224 --> 07:19.797
And now, as far as I know, ours is the number one bid.

07:20.238 --> 07:21.400
But they're trying to sell it on their own.

07:22.291 --> 07:24.114
And they're trying to sell it as a collection?

07:24.294 --> 07:25.235
Yeah, I know they're trying to sell it.

07:25.255 --> 07:34.609
But I mean, if they sell it to you, the understanding is probably that you're going to... Our bid was really a proposal on how to dispose of the collection.

07:34.669 --> 07:41.519
And the proposal is a very simple proposal, which is spend six months trying to sell it intact, and if that fails, then you must sell it at auction.

07:41.539 --> 07:43.442
And we want to handle both ends of it.

07:43.602 --> 07:48.389
Let's talk about that for a while, because that is kind of interesting to me, your feelings about that.

07:48.409 --> 07:50.372
Do you feel that this should be kept as a collection?

07:50.392 --> 07:50.813
Absolutely.

07:51.569 --> 07:52.290
And why is that?

07:52.870 --> 08:05.602
Because, primarily because it has been very well maintained, very well catalogued, material is accessible, and it's in one central place.

08:05.883 --> 08:11.929
It started out as a mishmash of material six years ago, but they spent six years curating it properly.

08:12.389 --> 08:15.332
So what you've now got is a research archive, a really good research archive.

08:16.913 --> 08:20.817
If you went to any library and you wanted to find out about vaudeville performers,

08:21.472 --> 08:25.678
I don't know, people who... Ricky explained the collection to me.

08:25.698 --> 08:27.120
I'm familiar with the collection.

08:27.180 --> 08:27.380
Okay.

08:27.400 --> 08:28.742
But where else could you go?

08:28.842 --> 08:38.595
And in theory, you want to find the names of all performers whose act consisted of farting, balancing a banana, and being on a high wire at the same time.

08:39.156 --> 08:39.957
They'd have it for you.

08:39.977 --> 08:41.038
They could access it.

08:41.098 --> 08:45.725
I mean, my point is, this stuff is duplicated, replicated elsewhere.

08:46.045 --> 08:48.969
But what you've got is, it's all in one room.

08:48.989 --> 08:50.091
Well, it's centralized.

08:50.111 --> 08:51.192
It's centralized.

08:51.577 --> 08:56.502
It's maintained, it's accessible, and it's indexed.

08:56.522 --> 08:57.483
So why break it up?

08:57.503 --> 09:04.750
Okay, but now this is a very, this is a surprising attitude for an auctioneer to take, isn't it?

09:04.770 --> 09:06.032
I'm an American citizen, after all.

09:06.472 --> 09:10.997
No, I mean, what, you can't, an auctioneer, by definition, isn't just after the higher prices.

09:11.077 --> 09:16.082
There's certain, if somebody comes in, there's an auction going on in, uh,

09:21.952 --> 09:31.225
In New York, later this month, or maybe early November, there's an entire correspondence between Greta Garbo and Cecil Beaton.

09:31.345 --> 09:31.986
Nine letters.

09:32.928 --> 09:36.693
Now, they're selling it as nine separate letters.

09:36.713 --> 09:37.514
And I think that's wrong.

09:39.738 --> 09:42.461
Because it represents the entire correspondence between Greta Garbo and Cecil Beaton.

09:42.702 --> 09:49.832
Now, I can make a point in their case, neither Greta Garbo nor Cecil Beaton are great historical figures, and they don't mean anything in...

09:50.572 --> 09:53.175
You know, the development of culture and the great scheme of things.

09:53.195 --> 09:53.655
Who's to say?

09:53.675 --> 09:53.896
Right.

09:54.676 --> 10:00.162
But supposing it was George Washington to Alexander Hamilton, or Madison to Jefferson, okay?

10:00.182 --> 10:04.687
So there are certain things that shouldn't be broken up, by definition.

10:04.707 --> 10:12.736
If, to follow up to the extreme, every color plate book that we get, then we should break up, because the parts are worth more than the whole, and we don't do that.

10:12.756 --> 10:15.499
That Mulholland collection, I have a great affinity for the Mulholland collection,

10:15.918 --> 10:17.621
We've handled it twice and once now.

10:17.861 --> 10:19.444
A great affection or affinity?

10:19.464 --> 10:20.926
Affinity and affection.

10:20.946 --> 10:21.648
I like the feel.

10:22.369 --> 10:23.491
And it really shouldn't be broken up.

10:23.551 --> 10:26.055
It's like carrying a family apart.

10:26.175 --> 10:34.990
So let's assume, and also I understand that I'm several months away from publication or anything, let's assume you get the commission to

10:35.257 --> 10:59.661
to handle this we probably won't we probably will no we probably will not we are now we are now off the record we are now in fact considering suing the rtc because they've taken our proposal and they're implementing it themselves okay which i think is both wiki and our infuriating our proposal was to do exactly what they're doing they may in fact be using our publicity releases to publicize the collection

11:00.451 --> 11:01.132
Thanks a lot.

11:01.172 --> 11:02.353
That's your government.

11:02.373 --> 11:02.533
Okay.

11:02.553 --> 11:03.814
Is Ricky out of this entirely?

11:03.834 --> 11:04.335
No, no.

11:04.355 --> 11:06.237
It's a joint proposal between Ricky Jay and Swan Daly.

11:06.677 --> 11:12.323
But I mean, is Ricky out of immediate supervision of the collection?

11:12.503 --> 11:13.524
Only because... Oh, yes.

11:13.945 --> 11:14.786
And he's making a movie.

11:14.806 --> 11:15.446
He's in Baltimore.

11:15.526 --> 11:17.188
I didn't say that, but he was curator of the movie.

11:17.208 --> 11:18.870
Yeah, oh, he's been out of that since January.

11:18.890 --> 11:19.330
But that's gone.

11:19.350 --> 11:19.831
He was fired.

11:20.051 --> 11:20.211
Yeah.

11:20.391 --> 11:23.234
He was fired, or he was laid off when the bank went into a receivership.

11:23.635 --> 11:26.998
This is probably one of the few assets in the savings and loan assets worth more.

11:27.502 --> 11:30.906
But that's another reason we proposed what we did.

11:30.926 --> 11:31.767
Is that true?

11:31.988 --> 11:33.990
Do you think that's true?

11:34.070 --> 11:36.093
The asset is worth more.

11:36.233 --> 11:37.975
I'm sure there are others.

11:38.175 --> 11:40.318
I'm sure there are others.

11:40.338 --> 11:56.158
But the RTC was, again, don't get me off on this, but basically they were very keen on the idea of doing this because they would get favorable publicity from the fact that here is something which is worth more than the bank paid for it,

11:56.375 --> 11:59.919
And not only are they going to make money for the taxpayer, but they're trying to keep it intact.

11:59.939 --> 12:02.883
So they're being good guys from three different points of view.

12:03.303 --> 12:04.224
So they're doing it on their own.

12:04.785 --> 12:07.889
They're negotiating with the Library of Congress, and they're negotiating with entertainers.

12:08.229 --> 12:12.294
They put it out on CBS and ABC and the Los Angeles Times.

12:12.534 --> 12:15.538
It's been widely publicized directly through there.

12:15.558 --> 12:18.401
And the only time she had a piece, and we'll go to the public library for a minute.

12:18.422 --> 12:19.263
I might just look it up.

12:19.283 --> 12:21.746
Within the past week, if you get a copy, would you send it for me?

12:21.766 --> 12:21.886
Sure.

12:21.906 --> 12:23.528
Where would it be, you think, on the business page?

12:23.988 --> 12:25.390
I think it was a front-page article.

12:25.410 --> 12:26.331
Front-page article.

12:26.767 --> 12:35.598
Because I know they get me all the times over here.

12:35.618 --> 12:39.904
Well, I want to speak to the reporter anyway, because I want to get a copy of the press release.

12:40.004 --> 12:42.707
Anyway, you can do that.

12:42.747 --> 12:44.550
I might even talk to the reporter myself.

12:44.590 --> 12:46.813
His name is Bates, I heard.

12:46.833 --> 12:47.113
Bates?

12:47.153 --> 12:47.854
Apparently he's a jerk.

12:48.395 --> 12:50.758
As are most reporters.

12:50.818 --> 12:53.061
I'm not a reporter anymore.

12:53.141 --> 12:53.481
I'm a writer.

12:53.501 --> 12:54.883
There's a difference.

12:55.235 --> 12:59.261
I think it's based, I had it written down someplace, because I was trying to reach him.

12:59.281 --> 13:01.364
Did you know this fellow, Lula?

13:01.444 --> 13:02.425
I met him two or three times.

13:03.367 --> 13:07.192
Did he impress you as a book collector, or was he really a magic fanatic?

13:07.272 --> 13:08.414
A magic fanatic.

13:08.434 --> 13:09.035
That's very nice.

13:09.475 --> 13:10.276
That's an inky-pinky.

13:10.376 --> 13:15.724
And that piece that you had given me is that he's an amateur victor.

13:15.957 --> 13:18.560
I've met him a couple times.

13:18.620 --> 13:19.841
He's out of this entirely.

13:19.861 --> 13:21.022
He's got no say in what happened.

13:21.042 --> 13:22.044
He's a personal banker to do.

13:22.064 --> 13:23.866
I mean, he's in deep shit.

13:23.946 --> 13:29.291
It is interesting that this is, you know, that book collecting enters, even enters the savings in one less.

13:31.033 --> 13:33.216
Well, it's not.

13:33.236 --> 13:36.519
But, you know, it's not book collecting, because he bought a collection.

13:37.040 --> 13:39.442
He saw something that tickled his fancy, and he had all this money.

13:40.103 --> 13:42.746
All the investors write.

13:43.267 --> 13:44.648
Did you say, did you tell me that you

13:44.948 --> 13:46.490
Can you give me any insight on Luke Feldman?

13:47.551 --> 13:47.992
I knew him.

13:48.793 --> 13:49.494
Okay, tell me about him.

13:51.877 --> 13:53.999
Speak about Albach, about Feldman.

13:54.059 --> 13:56.743
What do you want me to tell you?

13:57.664 --> 13:59.646
I came in the scene fairly late.

13:59.686 --> 14:04.552
Would he be the type of guy who could make an unorthodox deal?

14:05.033 --> 14:06.274
Oh, sure.

14:06.595 --> 14:11.601
Feldman was a flamboyant dealer in a modern sense.

14:12.021 --> 14:14.905
I mean, the way he dressed and the kind of cane that he carried,

14:15.104 --> 14:16.506
comported himself in the auction room.

14:16.526 --> 14:18.288
He was very flamboyant.

14:18.308 --> 14:19.310
That's really all I remember.

14:19.871 --> 14:20.431
Was he honest?

14:20.652 --> 14:21.293
Probably not.

14:21.693 --> 14:22.895
No more so than anybody else.

14:22.915 --> 14:24.377
He was flamboyant.

14:24.757 --> 14:25.839
He just liked big deals.

14:25.859 --> 14:27.641
He was involved in an awful lot of big deals.

14:28.162 --> 14:29.023
He liked to be seen.

14:29.063 --> 14:29.984
He liked to be heard.

14:31.086 --> 14:39.638
One quote, and we can do this in a half an hour, too, by the way.

14:40.599 --> 14:41.280
You had mentioned that

14:41.817 --> 14:51.389
Book collecting, I guess I'm looking for the status, the state, the health of book collecting today as opposed to what it might have been 30 or 40 or 50 years ago.

14:51.790 --> 14:53.993
You're not worried about the current recession.

14:54.013 --> 14:55.855
You're talking about book collecting in general.

14:55.955 --> 14:57.738
Even with the current recession, sure.

14:57.858 --> 15:00.421
I think book collecting is very healthy.

15:00.882 --> 15:06.509
Book collecting, somebody asked me the question last night when I made a presentation.

15:06.529 --> 15:11.335
What you're dealing with here is a sleepy backwater

15:12.175 --> 15:16.261
of the entire collecting horizon.

15:17.803 --> 15:30.943
There's just nothing, you know, the things which strike you as being amusing, like Feldman or Mulholland or even more, okay, it's

15:31.396 --> 15:38.666
minuscule compared to Deveen and to the Australian asshole that spent $69 million for Van Gogh and then went bankrupt.

15:38.686 --> 15:42.411
I mean, you know, you're talking about... I saw that picture out of the gate, by the way.

15:42.431 --> 16:01.015
But it's, you know, you're talking... It really... We're sort of... There's an enormous advantage to being a part of a relatively small and highly visible but unimportant part of the whole book world, of the entire collecting field.

16:01.417 --> 16:22.156
books have appreciated at a fairly steady pace over the years, relatively unaffected by what goes on in the real world, and certainly relatively unaffected by extremes in the stock market or extremes in the art market.

16:22.517 --> 16:23.779
Just because art has tripled,

16:24.738 --> 16:25.899
Doesn't mean their books will triple.

16:25.919 --> 16:28.441
Books will continue plotting along with over 5 to 10 percent a year.

16:28.822 --> 16:29.642
I'm convinced of that.

16:29.883 --> 16:32.024
Books never went down that severely during the Depression.

16:32.044 --> 16:33.506
Well, they did, actually.

16:33.606 --> 16:34.126
Not that severe.

16:34.146 --> 16:36.629
After the Jerome Kern sale, the bottom fell out.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.330
It took years to come back.

16:38.430 --> 16:40.212
But it was inflated at that point.

16:40.392 --> 16:43.715
But you're talking about a curve like this that maybe flattens out.

16:44.235 --> 16:53.023
You're not talking about this kind of a thing as you are certainly in gold and in silver and in stamps and in coins and in the art world.

16:53.493 --> 16:59.360
The art world now is looking at a fairly precipitous drop, potentially, in the next year or so.

17:00.481 --> 17:02.324
The worst that'll happen in the book is it'll level up.

17:02.484 --> 17:12.036
Well, how do you feel, and this is really jumping off the track, but how do you feel, say, about a self-beast who will back, was it Bond that spent $150 million?

17:12.396 --> 17:14.899
Or he didn't spend, but they financed him.

17:15.360 --> 17:16.581
He was willing to...

17:16.898 --> 17:29.110
I just threw a letter yesterday from a finance house in California that's offering to finance purchases by any of our customers that we wish to refer to them.

17:29.130 --> 17:31.493
So everybody's getting on the bandwagon.

17:31.633 --> 17:32.874
How do you feel about it?

17:32.894 --> 17:34.115
On the one hand, it's absurd.

17:34.536 --> 17:45.066
I mean, it's completely contrary to the purpose of auction because what they're doing is they're fueling the buying frenzy.

17:45.434 --> 17:47.618
On the other hand, it's probably smart business.

17:47.678 --> 17:48.780
So it's not a clear-cut thing.

17:49.340 --> 17:54.269
If you look at Sudby's balance sheet, they make a lot of money in real estate, they make a lot of money in their banking operation.

17:54.890 --> 17:59.137
They don't make all that much money in pure auctions, from what I understand.

18:00.258 --> 18:01.701
The auction business is a tough way to make money.

18:02.462 --> 18:12.218
But if you've got sidelines, like banking and real estate... Financing.

18:13.295 --> 18:15.577
That's just a personal feeling.

18:15.597 --> 18:28.329
The reason I thought about it, you're talking about how the graph had gone like that, and I wonder if that had anything to do with these new incentives that some of your competitors have given to competitors.

18:28.349 --> 18:28.790
I don't know.

18:28.910 --> 18:39.420
With the economy, the Japanese who financed with very strong loan incentives finance the buying of oil,

18:40.345 --> 18:49.037
had a lot to do with the teaching of the art market, a lot of which was bought at auction in the last few years, and Sotheby's does help that.

18:49.057 --> 18:51.380
We're not in the art market.

18:51.440 --> 18:58.910
Explain to me on tape, you did say one thing very interesting about your role, your niche in this scene.

18:58.970 --> 19:03.036
You said there are really three auction houses in New York who deal in books and manuscripts.

19:03.056 --> 19:06.100
You tend to deal exclusively in this area.

19:06.502 --> 19:13.275
They go after the real big, dazzling Bradley Martin, Estelle Doheny big things.

19:13.916 --> 19:15.840
And, you know, Glenn and Butter might be something else.

19:16.381 --> 19:21.451
But then you did say that there's a battleground in between where you can test, where you kind of go after this.

19:21.611 --> 19:23.495
You gave me a quote on that, which I thought was very good.

19:23.535 --> 19:24.838
I'd love to have it on tape.

19:24.858 --> 19:25.739
I don't remember what it was.

19:25.860 --> 19:26.842
It was kind of like that.

19:27.102 --> 19:28.645
We were talking about something like that.

19:29.080 --> 19:39.716
What you've got is three houses that are capable of doing identical things.

19:40.497 --> 19:43.141
And Subby's and Christie's role is defined.

19:43.521 --> 19:46.065
The role of their book department is not defined by the book department.

19:46.085 --> 19:47.267
I think it's really what it comes down to.

19:47.287 --> 19:53.075
The role of the book department is defined as being a department in a major international enterprise.

19:53.095 --> 19:56.961
Whereas the role of the book department is defined by the book department because that's all we are.

19:57.751 --> 20:10.164
Given any particular item, with some exception, minor exception, given any particular item, we will get the same price, and it will sell to the same person, because there's only so many customers.

20:10.244 --> 20:17.773
Again, that's not 100% true, but by and large, you've got the same people selling to the same people.

20:18.854 --> 20:22.758
You've got the same buyers, the same sellers, and they've got a choice of three houses.

20:23.158 --> 20:24.720
Absolutely.

20:24.920 --> 20:51.653
case because i've been going to all these precautions and i mean i know everybody yeah the people i see here i've seen christie's i've seen it so do what so given given any item that's worth five ten fifteen twenty thousand dollars we'll get the same price okay but if there's but if there's a major collection of a certain kind we simply will never even get a chance at it you said there's a poor community last time we make a very good living selling things they don't touch but you said that there is that area five hundred dollars

20:51.852 --> 20:52.713
$2,000.

20:52.853 --> 20:58.219
Our bread and butter is $500 to $2,000, which is below their minimum.

20:58.279 --> 21:03.025
For them to make the net, a lot of those people standing around there that park avenue.

21:03.045 --> 21:07.570
If you walk in with a $1,500 book, the chances are you'll be rejected because it doesn't meet their minimum.

21:08.070 --> 21:10.333
I think for a single walk-in, the minimum is $2,000.

21:10.793 --> 21:11.794
On anything, probably.

21:11.854 --> 21:12.515
Well, I'm not sure.

21:12.535 --> 21:13.316
I don't have the book department.

21:13.336 --> 21:13.997
What's your minimum?

21:14.017 --> 21:14.958
Do you have a minimum?

21:14.978 --> 21:15.038
No.

21:15.058 --> 21:16.720
Well, it's a reasonable minimum.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.463
If somebody walks in with a book worth $100, we won't take it.

21:19.483 --> 21:21.285
If somebody walks in with a book worth $500 or $600,

21:21.822 --> 21:23.104
We'll take it if it's interesting.

21:24.305 --> 21:24.766
It depends.

21:24.786 --> 21:28.791
If somebody walks in with a collection, that makes them a little morbid.

21:28.891 --> 21:32.696
It depends.

21:33.016 --> 21:38.783
If somebody walks in with three books worth $1,000 and one is worth $100 and one is worth $800, we'll take it.

21:39.264 --> 21:41.206
But 10 $100 books are just not worth the trouble.

21:41.527 --> 21:44.651
Technically, our minimum consignment is $1,000.

21:44.791 --> 21:49.737
But we have an enormous amount of flexibility.

21:50.037 --> 21:51.479
how we exercise those minimums.

21:51.539 --> 21:59.712
Now, when Arthur Freeman walked me through Quaritch in London, and he said, listen, as a practical matter, we can't sell a book for less than $100.

22:00.573 --> 22:01.996
I mean, this is a deal of time.

22:02.016 --> 22:02.937
That's true.

22:02.957 --> 22:03.899
I said, look at this place.

22:04.259 --> 22:06.122
You look in the overheads.

22:06.142 --> 22:07.504
We have to get a minimum.

22:07.665 --> 22:08.326
Minimum.

22:08.426 --> 22:09.507
I mean, we won't sell anything.

22:09.588 --> 22:12.512
Well, I mean, look, of course, I'm sure you're going to find things.

22:12.552 --> 22:14.295
Yeah, part of that is ingenuous.

22:14.335 --> 22:17.580
I mean, if somebody walks in with $50 in their hand,

22:18.100 --> 22:29.094
and it ends up that nothing but people with $50 walk into your store, you better start selling things to them because you can stand on the principal not selling the owner for $100 and become principal in the backup situation.

22:29.134 --> 22:36.883
So we're not going to go market towards the people with $50 in their pocket while we have the opportunity to market towards the people with stock.

22:36.903 --> 22:38.265
But there is the overlap.

22:38.846 --> 22:43.291
We compete constantly in the $2,000 to $20,000 range.

22:44.252 --> 22:47.196
And our prices, we set as many record prices as they do.

22:47.918 --> 22:50.922
It's as simple as that.

22:50.942 --> 22:51.783
Any suggestions?

22:51.863 --> 22:57.229
I think it would be really interesting what collectors are today, off the record, on the record.

22:57.249 --> 22:59.112
In a way, we don't really know.

22:59.132 --> 23:03.557
In many respects, you know, we talked about several names.

23:03.597 --> 23:04.719
You know, you know, Manny.

23:06.841 --> 23:09.785
You know, you know, kind of.

23:09.805 --> 23:15.732
But people like people like Quaritch and Mags and Zimneys and

23:17.973 --> 23:22.217
If there are major collectors, a lot of people don't come to auction, they work through a dealer.

23:22.237 --> 23:24.439
And, you know, we may know who they are, but we're not sure who they are.

23:24.880 --> 23:35.170
So an auction house really is not a good source to... Well, if Max pays a million dollars for a book, you know, it's going to Getty.

23:35.390 --> 23:37.092
Okay, but, you know, but Getty's not a collector.

23:37.933 --> 23:40.896
You know, Getty's an institution now.

23:41.316 --> 23:44.179
I don't think he's buying it.

23:44.920 --> 23:47.042
Just bought the Ptolemy for a month and a half.

23:47.082 --> 23:47.963
Okay, I don't know.

23:49.259 --> 23:50.842
So you don't know.

23:50.962 --> 23:51.683
I don't know.

23:52.264 --> 23:53.886
Listen, Corp buys a lot from us.

23:53.946 --> 23:56.671
And I don't know and I don't care who they buy from.

23:56.771 --> 23:58.053
I just want to keep buying.

23:58.333 --> 23:59.636
We have about five minutes, I guess.

24:02.801 --> 24:06.386
You just said there's something always there, something there for everyone.

24:06.406 --> 24:06.927
Absolutely.

24:08.029 --> 24:09.892
That was an inch of my talk last night.

24:09.912 --> 24:14.599
Anybody who wants to collect books, in almost every sale, you can find something, whether it's early.

24:14.619 --> 24:16.903
Because book collecting takes so many different forms.

24:17.423 --> 24:27.035
You can collect by subject, you can collect by era, you can collect by illustrator, you can collect by author, you can collect by number of pages, you can collect by color of binding.

24:27.235 --> 24:34.064
I could take you to any bookstore anywhere and I can show you something that would turn you on, no matter what you're interested in.

24:34.925 --> 24:38.349
So in that sense, it's a very democratic pursuit.

24:38.549 --> 24:39.010
Absolutely.

24:39.479 --> 24:45.545
You can do it for almost no money at all.

24:45.605 --> 24:47.427
You can choose to define your collection.

24:47.627 --> 24:50.170
And you don't exclude that kind of person from your halls.

24:50.970 --> 24:53.713
Well, in a way you'd exclude them.

24:54.113 --> 24:59.439
Well, you can come in here and buy things for paying 50 bucks.

25:00.440 --> 25:01.681
Yes, you can.

25:01.841 --> 25:02.502
Yes, you can.

25:02.682 --> 25:06.786
I'll tell you, I'm kicking my ass right now because I had a number last time and I didn't

25:07.458 --> 25:14.207
I now find a book that's found really, sorry, it's called Cookery Books by Pennell's wife, Elizabeth Pennell.

25:14.347 --> 25:14.908
Elizabeth Pennell.

25:14.988 --> 25:16.210
I think they went for $350.

25:16.770 --> 25:18.232
That's a pretty good price for that book.

25:18.453 --> 25:21.737
But what I'm trying to say is, you know, I'm sorry I didn't buy that.

25:21.857 --> 25:25.522
I mean, because I love what's holding up with my illustrated books.

25:25.542 --> 25:31.470
You know, we don't, anybody who's interested in collecting, whether it's books or anything else, is welcome in an auction house.

25:31.490 --> 25:32.732
Do we really have anything for them?

25:33.032 --> 25:33.493
Not really.

25:33.573 --> 25:36.537
I mean, if you're going to be a $50 collector, it's a terrible mistake to

25:36.989 --> 25:38.351
to spend that money in an auction house.

25:38.431 --> 25:39.312
Oh, I agree.

25:39.973 --> 25:52.128
But in terms of... You'd rather deal with the dealers?

25:53.830 --> 25:56.193
You'd rather do business with the dealers?

25:56.213 --> 26:00.839
In the long run, the dealers are more important.

26:00.859 --> 26:02.361
Well, because they're here all the time.

26:02.481 --> 26:05.545
The collector's going to pay more money for the individual item.

26:05.727 --> 26:09.371
Not necessarily true, but generally true.

26:09.391 --> 26:10.152
But you can't figure it out.

26:10.172 --> 26:12.755
Is that going to figure in the market for the dealer?

26:12.795 --> 26:15.098
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

26:15.118 --> 26:17.341
Dealers are bidding on commission for clients.

26:18.142 --> 26:22.427
A lot of what they're buying here and the prices seem to be very high.

26:22.447 --> 26:24.609
A dealer isn't going to put it in his inventory.

26:24.629 --> 26:28.614
The higher the price of a book, the less of a marketer.

26:28.634 --> 26:32.258
A dealer is, don't forget, a dealer is just like an auction house.

26:33.284 --> 26:39.110
The most difficult thing in running an auction house is not finding customers, it's finding material to sell.

26:39.131 --> 26:40.192
And the same is true with dealers.

26:40.632 --> 26:45.478
The light blood of a dealer is not selling, it's acquiring material.

26:45.498 --> 26:50.924
So if a good item comes up for sale, it's absolutely essential.

26:51.164 --> 26:58.492
You talk to any dealer, there are dealers that go from book fair to book fair, they take a booth in a book fair, they couldn't give a shit if they sell anything.

26:58.592 --> 27:02.937
They want to get to the other dealer's booth before anybody else does.

27:03.389 --> 27:08.856
The higher the price of a book, the less of a spread there is between the buying price.

27:08.876 --> 27:13.803
If a dealer buys a book for $50 or $100 or $200, sure, he's buying it at half of what he'll sell it.

27:13.823 --> 27:15.145
The seller will be buying it for stock.

27:15.365 --> 27:16.226
Right.

27:16.247 --> 27:19.651
The higher the price, the greater the likelihood he's buying for a client.

27:20.873 --> 27:22.815
I think that's a rule of thumb that you could apply.

27:22.916 --> 27:24.097
I would apply that, sure.

27:24.117 --> 27:27.542
I can't believe that somebody, I see some small dealers are paying $2,000, $3,000, $4,000 for a book.

27:27.722 --> 27:28.744
They're not putting it in inventory.

27:29.104 --> 27:31.287
If either got a commission and they make a 10% markup,

27:31.520 --> 27:33.743
Or they have a pretty good idea who they're going to sell it to.

27:34.183 --> 27:36.466
And because, look, remember one thing.

27:36.486 --> 27:39.469
The auction price is public knowledge.

27:39.489 --> 27:42.833
You can't buy a $5,000 book and offer it for $12,000.

27:43.093 --> 27:43.934
But a lot of people do.

27:44.455 --> 27:46.037
And some get away with it, some don't.

27:46.337 --> 27:47.679
But there are dealers who will not buy it.

27:47.699 --> 27:51.423
Well, dealers I won't name because I was at all the Bradley Martin sales.

27:51.804 --> 27:54.827
And I saw especially the American Literature sale.

27:55.803 --> 27:58.607
And it was advertised as Bradley Martin's own copy.

27:58.767 --> 28:00.730
Yeah, but did you check the cost?

28:01.331 --> 28:02.773
I kept notes and everything.

28:02.793 --> 28:03.474
I got all the prices.

28:03.574 --> 28:04.455
Oh, but check your cost.

28:04.475 --> 28:12.226
Dealers, I've seen a lot of Bradley Martin stuff in the market now, and it's marked up maybe 25%, maybe 30%, and maybe a little more research as Madonna.

28:12.547 --> 28:14.850
I haven't found things that have been doubled or tripled.

28:14.870 --> 28:16.172
But then again, what's wrong with that?

28:16.432 --> 28:17.534
What, doubling or tripling?

28:18.155 --> 28:18.515
Yeah.

28:18.575 --> 28:20.538
Well, you run the risk of being called a Donut.

28:21.319 --> 28:25.405
That you're, what do you call it, a...

28:25.672 --> 28:29.676
An opportunist or whatever?

28:29.697 --> 28:33.060
Look, there are dealers who will not buy at the auction because then the cost is known.

28:34.302 --> 28:37.665
There's something... If you go into a... Look, it's human nature.

28:37.685 --> 28:47.076
If you go into a store and you buy something, no matter how much you want it, you buy that tie and you spend $60 for a tie, it would really infuriate me if I know that the store paid $15 for that tie.

28:47.276 --> 28:48.658
It's probably what they paid for it.

28:48.678 --> 28:54.004
It may be, but if I really knew it... Now, the market is 100%, and that's why I buy on sale.

28:54.024 --> 28:55.105
The market is only 50%.

28:55.608 --> 28:56.989
But, you know, it's that kind of thing.

28:57.049 --> 29:06.458
People don't want to be told that the dealer has made an enormous profit off him, especially if he's a good customer.

29:07.499 --> 29:09.381
You're my good customer, and I'm a dealer.

29:09.941 --> 29:10.762
I have you in mind.

29:11.222 --> 29:12.884
Listen, I bought this at Bradley Martin.

29:12.904 --> 29:16.467
I had you in mind, and I'll sell it to you at only a 10% markup.

29:16.487 --> 29:17.888
How can you turn it down?

29:17.908 --> 29:22.533
But if I offer it to you a double, and you can read the catalog as well as I can, you'll say, my God, what a crook.

29:23.033 --> 29:25.075
But then there's another whole...

29:25.055 --> 29:29.740
separate psychology, it could also be operating two other ones.

29:29.760 --> 29:44.337
One is, somebody could buy it at Martin, advertise it for a hugely inflated price as a promotional gimmick for themselves to a public who read the words Martin in the newspapers but really doesn't know what the hell was going on, just for name recognition.

29:44.918 --> 29:49.143
And you don't know what the guy sold it for, actually, if he finally unloaded the book.

29:49.163 --> 29:53.408
You can advertise it for anything and make the same percent above view it.

29:54.130 --> 29:58.114
The dealer's prices are very suspect.

29:58.454 --> 30:01.237
I hope you know that.

30:01.317 --> 30:02.638
How do you mean?

30:02.678 --> 30:04.980
Look at dealer's catalogs.

30:05.080 --> 30:08.804
You say, oh, he got $4,000.

30:09.064 --> 30:11.687
No, he's asking $4,000 for that.

30:11.707 --> 30:13.148
10% discount, no sweat.

30:13.168 --> 30:14.429
20% discount sometime.

30:14.609 --> 30:16.831
And a 30% discount occasionally.

30:17.032 --> 30:20.114
Especially if it goes from one catalog to the next.

30:20.154 --> 30:20.855
Well, no.

30:21.035 --> 30:22.176
No, it depends with the buyers.

30:22.817 --> 30:23.918
And there are many people

30:24.353 --> 30:26.336
who in the book business feel that they can't negotiate.

30:27.097 --> 30:27.738
So would a dealer.

30:27.758 --> 30:29.521
You know, a dealer is no different than anybody else.

30:29.541 --> 30:34.528
If I ask for $4,000 for that book, and you're going to pay me $4,000, I'm not going to offer you a discount.

30:34.548 --> 30:38.073
On the other hand, if you ask for a discount, I might grant it to you.

30:38.093 --> 30:41.478
Scheide was that late, Mr. Scheide's father.

30:41.659 --> 30:45.925
I went to all of Rosenbach's correspondence in Philadelphia, and he was a bicker.

30:46.626 --> 30:48.589
I mean, you bought the Google Word Bible for a minute.

30:48.873 --> 30:51.316
And you start to say, well, there's a couple of leaves missing now.

30:51.376 --> 30:53.498
We're just trying to beat them down on the tracks.

30:53.699 --> 30:55.361
No, but that's absolutely invaluable.

30:55.381 --> 30:55.561
Yeah.

30:57.243 --> 30:59.646
I think we've got some good stuff here.

31:00.547 --> 31:17.226
I guess the difference between book selling today, and not necessarily in the auction business, but book dealers, and say on a Rosenbach day, is that guys like Krugs and Rosenbach would buy big ticket items for stock.

31:17.645 --> 31:23.914
And what you just said is when you see a big-ticket item, you can just assume that he's buying that somewhere.

31:24.034 --> 31:26.838
It's hard to generalize.

31:29.062 --> 31:33.368
And I'm not sure that you're right.

31:34.690 --> 31:45.846
My guess is that when Krauss or Rosenbach or the Drakes or anybody else bought big items for stock,

31:47.193 --> 31:49.976
I'll give you a good quote.

31:49.996 --> 31:52.980
You never have too many good quotes.

31:53.000 --> 31:53.441
What the hell?

31:53.461 --> 31:53.981
How does it go?

31:59.889 --> 32:03.112
Something to the effect of, when I buy books, I never make mistakes.

32:03.793 --> 32:05.495
When I make a mistake, it becomes my inventory.

32:07.298 --> 32:16.609
So Rosenbach will buy something with Goheny in mind, or with Flagler in mind, or with Huntington in mind.

32:16.893 --> 32:18.555
And there's Bell Green in mind.

32:19.277 --> 32:20.158
Fine, but they don't buy it.

32:20.859 --> 32:22.421
Lo and behold, it becomes inventory.

32:22.441 --> 32:23.142
So he makes a mistake.

32:23.302 --> 32:24.204
Now, there are cases.

32:24.885 --> 32:28.310
Hey, Krauss clearly bought a Gutenberg for publicity.

32:28.891 --> 32:30.553
And he makes no bones about it in his book.

32:30.874 --> 32:31.755
So, sure, there are cases.

32:32.115 --> 32:36.181
But I don't think that the basic nature of the book business has changed that much.

32:36.201 --> 32:38.184
I think human nature is the same.

32:38.224 --> 32:39.767
I think the nature of book selling is the same.

32:39.807 --> 32:42.451
I think the psychology of book selling is essentially the same.

32:42.471 --> 32:43.953
Psychology of collecting as well.

32:44.293 --> 32:45.816
And I think the psychology of collecting as well.

32:45.836 --> 32:46.056
Absolutely.

32:46.407 --> 32:51.814
I don't even know where it goes.

32:52.034 --> 32:53.937
Why should it change?

32:53.977 --> 32:55.859
Human nature stays the same.

32:55.959 --> 32:57.181
All this change is pricing.

32:57.421 --> 32:59.063
What's changing?

32:59.224 --> 33:00.045
Pace changes.

33:00.065 --> 33:00.886
Pace changes.

33:01.246 --> 33:03.930
General Harry can't give away today for instance.

33:03.990 --> 33:04.631
Pace changes.

33:04.891 --> 33:05.952
Prices change.

33:06.633 --> 33:09.096
The mechanics change and the fax machine has changed.

33:09.557 --> 33:10.959
Trading and collected enormously.

33:10.999 --> 33:12.240
So has the telephone.

33:12.481 --> 33:13.562
What you don't find anymore

33:13.778 --> 33:20.567
is the charming idea of Mr. Rosenbach taking a suitcase full of books and taking a train across the country to San Marino, California.

33:20.587 --> 33:21.028
That's right.

33:21.088 --> 33:23.852
Those stories are marvellous.

33:23.872 --> 33:29.439
And, you know, he gets invited to dinner, and he always sold something, and he knew just what to put in his suitcase.

33:29.479 --> 33:36.529
One of the final letters that Huntington wrote Rosenbach, which I'm having copied, is that you're certainly welcome to come and stay at the ranch

33:36.712 --> 33:39.755
But don't bring any books.

33:40.015 --> 33:42.317
I'm not trying anymore.

33:42.437 --> 33:45.040
That essentially is really the beginning.

33:45.740 --> 33:48.603
I think the style has changed.

33:48.623 --> 33:49.544
People aren't so elegant.

33:49.584 --> 33:50.865
People don't write so much anymore.

33:50.885 --> 33:52.287
You pick up the phone.

33:52.307 --> 33:58.252
You go through correspondence and you'd have four letters about the sale of a $20 book.

33:58.713 --> 34:01.135
Now you make one phone call to sell a $10,000 book.

34:01.475 --> 34:02.777
So those have changed.

34:02.797 --> 34:05.419
But the basic nature of it.

34:05.787 --> 34:14.039
And the Scheide case, for instance, I went to all of Rosenbach's correspondence with John Scheide, someone named Gutenberg, and then it ends.

34:15.040 --> 34:16.562
And I don't know what they paid for it.

34:16.702 --> 34:18.165
I bet.

34:18.565 --> 34:21.269
Well, what happened is I know exactly what happened.

34:21.349 --> 34:24.494
There was finally a Western Union telegram set, and it's there.

34:24.714 --> 34:26.697
I have to see you out in Titusville.

34:26.937 --> 34:29.421
So he went out, and it was done face to face.

34:29.841 --> 34:32.104
So the deal went down face to face.

34:32.345 --> 34:35.389
So the correspondence, which is wonderful, tracing the whole background,

34:35.588 --> 34:36.830
It doesn't have the last day.

34:37.250 --> 34:39.694
I mean, I would, you know, you want things to pursue.

34:40.695 --> 34:41.757
Yes, I would love it.

34:41.817 --> 34:48.687
You know, one of the questions last night was what effect does taxation have on collecting?

34:48.707 --> 34:50.530
Oh, it's changed the whole thing.

34:50.590 --> 34:55.297
The collector is now... But which piece of which collecting has taxation?

34:55.377 --> 34:59.663
Well, the private collector is now preeminent again in the not giving stuff to institutions.

34:59.823 --> 35:03.008
Institutions have really been hurt by it because you can't write off gifts.

35:03.249 --> 35:04.971
That's not...

35:05.305 --> 35:08.230
I don't know about taxation in terms of buying and selling if you sell a book.

35:09.612 --> 35:14.480
I'm not sure you want to put it in your book, but in a sense.

35:14.720 --> 35:16.864
It might have to do with investing.

35:16.884 --> 35:18.847
You have an underground economy.

35:18.867 --> 35:19.909
Books are being bought and sold.

35:20.470 --> 35:21.411
As investments.

35:21.431 --> 35:26.500
No, they're being bought and sold, and it's an undeclared form of investment.

35:26.820 --> 35:28.663
If I buy security, I've got to report it.

35:29.065 --> 35:31.928
You've got to report the purchase and the sale.

35:32.149 --> 35:41.259
But if I've got a thing going, if I'm a dealer and you're a collector, and you and I are sort of trading books back and forth, I mean, technically it's the same as trading securities, isn't it?

35:42.781 --> 35:44.824
But how many people do you think report those transactions?

35:44.844 --> 35:45.685
Trading and what?

35:45.705 --> 35:47.307
You mean trading in the... Trading enough.

35:47.367 --> 35:52.252
I've got three copies of Don Quicksit, so I'll trade you my two Quicksits for a da-da-da.

35:52.573 --> 35:55.096
You're either upgrading your collection or you're trading things.

35:55.336 --> 35:58.600
I bought something in London, and you're not only my dealer, but you're my friend.

35:59.221 --> 36:00.925
I mean, this goes on all the time.

36:00.966 --> 36:03.171
Well, Chef Louis Zatmari, you know him?

36:03.913 --> 36:07.442
He told me he did a lot of consulting stuff.

36:07.462 --> 36:08.846
And he got paid and booked.

36:09.187 --> 36:12.054
And he said, well, what I would do is tell him, he said, well, we want to give you some money.

36:12.074 --> 36:13.939
And I'd say, well, you know, I don't want any money, but

36:14.290 --> 36:19.656
If you go down the street in such and such a bookstore, there's a wonderfully tunable there.

36:19.756 --> 36:21.758
It probably costs $1,000 or something like that.

36:21.899 --> 36:22.419
It's a barter.

36:22.439 --> 36:25.763
He would have that thing delivered by messenger within 24 hours.

36:25.823 --> 36:26.724
It's a barter scheme.

36:26.764 --> 36:28.706
And that never got reported in his income tax.

36:28.726 --> 36:30.108
And he said that to me on the records.

36:30.128 --> 36:30.949
That's why I'm repeating.

36:31.209 --> 36:40.700
Well, I'm saying if you, not on the record, not on the record, but basically, I don't know if it really affects the market, but I think it's an interesting sidelight.

36:41.320 --> 36:41.581
It is.

36:41.761 --> 36:42.762
Which is interesting to me.

36:43.028 --> 36:52.097
You know, most people, most collectors who either buy and sell books or trade books aren't really doing it for the profit, and yet in the process, frequently do make a profit.

36:52.117 --> 36:54.339
A serious collector isn't it for the money, anyway.

36:54.359 --> 36:56.201
Well, it's a bad way to make money.

36:56.962 --> 36:57.062
Sure.

36:57.082 --> 36:58.443
Especially if you're buying from dealers.

36:59.384 --> 37:01.947
Because it's going to be very bad to recruit.

37:01.967 --> 37:02.087
Uh-uh.

37:02.107 --> 37:02.868
Go back to him no more.

37:02.888 --> 37:03.488
He did very well.

37:04.649 --> 37:05.450
Are you sure could he not?

37:05.470 --> 37:06.211
We don't know that.

37:06.972 --> 37:07.692
We're pretty sure.

37:07.712 --> 37:10.355
We don't know what they paid for a lot of these things.

37:10.375 --> 37:12.377
But talk about that.

37:12.813 --> 37:14.736
Considering the prices he made money.

37:15.016 --> 37:22.126
I'd be very interested to see what he paid Fleming for a lot of these things, because I knew off the record what he paid him for a lot of these things.

37:22.146 --> 37:24.129
No, but there's enough items that came up with that.

37:24.349 --> 37:28.395
Well, the Cervantes was expected to go for $250,000.

37:28.415 --> 37:30.137
It goes for $1.65 million.

37:30.157 --> 37:31.700
The Shakespeare's, he paid $165,000.

37:31.820 --> 37:33.342
Well, they got $2 million.

37:33.462 --> 37:35.625
All right, so there are two items right there.

37:35.946 --> 37:38.089
That will take care of the rest of the loan.

37:38.109 --> 37:40.091
That will take care of a lot of mistakes.

37:40.111 --> 37:41.233
Yeah, yeah.

37:42.074 --> 37:43.744
You've given me more time.

37:44.206 --> 37:45.172
Thank you very much.

37:45.313 --> 37:46.178
I'm available.

37:46.198 --> 37:47.747
It happens to be very busy.
