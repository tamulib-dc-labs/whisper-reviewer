WEBVTT

00:01.837 --> 00:02.698
Okay, we're running.

00:03.500 --> 00:06.946
I'm really very pleased to be talking to you.

00:06.966 --> 00:08.669
I'm a fan of longstanding.

00:10.111 --> 00:15.801
And I generally write about books and authors for a number.

00:15.821 --> 00:18.225
I've got about 22 papers now, I guess it is.

00:19.049 --> 00:22.055
And the Allentown morning call is one of my clients.

00:22.075 --> 00:24.379
Is that where Lehigh is?

00:24.820 --> 00:25.321
Yeah, I guess.

00:26.423 --> 00:26.984
I've never been down there.

00:27.004 --> 00:27.284
Yeah, it is.

00:27.384 --> 00:27.825
I'm teasing.

00:27.885 --> 00:32.955
But they called and asked if I'd be willing to talk.

00:32.975 --> 00:34.978
I said, are you kidding?

00:34.998 --> 00:39.126
I said, when I found out you were going to be in Boston, you know, great.

00:39.146 --> 00:41.671
So it's fortuitous for me.

00:41.771 --> 00:42.492
Thank you.

00:42.809 --> 01:03.109
I guess because the subject of your talk at Lehigh is, maybe we just ought to give a little bit about the theme of your speech, or your lecture rather, which is the playwright versus the American theater.

01:03.309 --> 01:04.771
What is the title of this, I guess?

01:04.851 --> 01:07.454
No, just the playwright versus the theater.

01:07.474 --> 01:10.697
I don't know if you could just give me a nice, inclusive title.

01:10.717 --> 01:11.938
I was going to talk about whatever I want.

01:12.222 --> 01:12.743
I see.

01:12.783 --> 01:13.443
So it changes.

01:13.483 --> 01:16.427
So this is not a set piece, so to speak.

01:16.747 --> 01:22.613
I have some things that I'm forced to say over and over again because nobody pays any attention to what I say.

01:23.474 --> 01:25.376
But no, I like to improvise.

01:25.457 --> 01:27.339
I don't even speak from a text.

01:27.819 --> 01:28.099
Really?

01:28.600 --> 01:30.582
No, because that way you can't look at people.

01:30.602 --> 01:35.007
What's more boring than sitting there watching somebody who's reading something?

01:35.027 --> 01:35.367
I agree.

01:35.988 --> 01:37.310
It's so boring.

01:37.330 --> 01:39.512
Do you see it as a form of performance?

01:40.758 --> 01:44.344
Any public appearance is a form of performance.

01:44.364 --> 01:46.167
You have to be effective on the stage.

01:46.187 --> 01:49.533
You've got to engage with your audience.

01:49.593 --> 01:56.165
That's one of the reasons I don't read from a text, because I like to look at people and make eye contact.

01:56.205 --> 01:58.408
That's very important.

01:58.428 --> 02:03.998
But I don't consider it as a performance in any pejorative sense, no.

02:04.096 --> 02:10.362
No, and I certainly don't intend to suggest it in a pejorative sense either.

02:10.402 --> 02:12.203
When did the play open in London, by the way?

02:12.844 --> 02:13.485
Free Toll of Women.

02:13.945 --> 02:16.908
Yes, I know the play, but when did it open?

02:16.928 --> 02:17.568
Last Tuesday.

02:17.588 --> 02:18.629
And how's it going?

02:19.170 --> 02:21.252
Well, I've never seen such reviews.

02:21.272 --> 02:22.293
Extraordinary.

02:22.313 --> 02:22.733
Wonderful.

02:24.415 --> 02:27.618
You must say again, I'm sorry?

02:27.638 --> 02:28.699
Almost embarrassing.

02:28.719 --> 02:29.820
Not quite, but almost.

02:30.180 --> 02:31.041
No, why do you say that?

02:31.141 --> 02:32.382
Well, because they're so good.

02:33.492 --> 02:38.262
I mean, the London Times called the play a towering masterpiece.

02:38.343 --> 02:40.127
Now, that's just silly.

02:40.147 --> 02:41.149
You know, it's a good play.

02:44.676 --> 02:45.318
You don't agree.

02:45.899 --> 02:53.155
Well, listen, I'll take it where I can get it, but I don't think about myself or my own, what I write in those terms.

02:53.590 --> 03:01.221
Do the English respond differently to your work, do you find, say, than the... And I'm not talking critics either.

03:01.321 --> 03:02.823
I'm talking about theatergoers.

03:02.863 --> 03:05.987
It's hard to generalize.

03:06.027 --> 03:15.981
I think there's probably a longer tradition of people who go to the theater being exposed to a greater variety of theater in London.

03:16.001 --> 03:20.708
I mean, those awful musicals haven't completely taken over the London theater yet.

03:20.808 --> 03:20.948
Mm-hmm.

03:21.232 --> 03:32.985
You've got two national theaters in London, the National Theater and the Royal Shakespeare Company, that are doing really first-rate plays, you know, Euripides, Chekhov, Decad, people like that.

03:33.085 --> 03:43.976
So people have more of an opportunity to see good stuff and therefore have more of an opportunity to make intelligent decisions about what theater should be all about.

03:44.577 --> 03:48.381
Do Euripides and Chekhov attract good audiences, too?

03:48.681 --> 03:49.923
They fill the house, basically?

03:49.943 --> 03:50.243
They do.

03:50.864 --> 03:57.397
Do you think that would happen here as well if we gave people the opportunity to see such plays?

03:57.417 --> 03:57.958
Yes, of course.

03:58.018 --> 04:12.788
I've been convinced for years that if somebody let me fill every single Broadway theater with great plays for a period of 10 years, beautifully acted, that that would become the taste of the theater-going audience in America.

04:13.882 --> 04:16.649
You don't mind if I hop around here.

04:17.691 --> 04:24.247
I once asked, this is a number of years ago, when I was doing an interview with Robert Sheru, the publisher and editor.

04:24.287 --> 04:29.460
Of course, we have, as I'm sure you do, a shared passion for Shakespeare.

04:30.217 --> 04:36.704
And I asked him this silly question, if you had an opportunity to ask William Shakespeare one question, what would it be?

04:36.724 --> 04:49.398
And he said, interestingly, and I think it's germane to a discussion with you, is I would ask him why he never saw the need or the necessity to publish his own plays.

04:50.759 --> 04:53.102
Of course, these were all done posthumously.

04:53.538 --> 05:06.677
And I wonder, you know, being a person who writes for performance, certainly your works are published, but you're writing material that is to be perceived in action.

05:06.697 --> 05:10.282
I wonder if this provokes any kind of a comment from you.

05:10.463 --> 05:11.825
It's not necessarily a question.

05:11.845 --> 05:16.331
Well, there weren't that many publishing houses.

05:16.371 --> 05:21.739
Getting your work published was a rich man's game, basically.

05:22.192 --> 05:51.490
in london and he was concerned getting his plays performed i don't think he thought about it very much i can't imagine that he did but i wonder if he just thought that they were ephemeral works though no i doubt that even even today you know playwrights like to get their work in print especially in acting editions but but uh nobody uh people do not buy many copies of plays you know so it's not that important the question that i would ask

05:52.347 --> 05:59.556
Shakespeare, aside from maybe a couple of questions about some of his plays, like does Hamlet really have to be that long?

06:02.459 --> 06:12.932
And a more important question, I'm convinced that when Lear, at the beginning of the play, asks his daughter those questions, he's joking.

06:13.452 --> 06:15.575
He's kidding around, is my conviction.

06:16.196 --> 06:18.118
And when he gets those awful answers,

06:19.043 --> 06:20.987
That's what sets the whole play in motion.

06:21.067 --> 06:24.473
Most people do it like he was asking nasty questions, but I don't think he was.

06:24.493 --> 06:29.923
I think he was, you know, he was kidding, hardly expecting the answers that he got.

06:30.284 --> 06:35.113
But I think even more than that, the question I would ask him is what does he think of Chekhov and what does he think of Becker?

06:37.517 --> 06:37.598
Hmm.

06:37.618 --> 06:37.698
Hmm.

06:37.718 --> 06:38.419
As, uh,

06:39.428 --> 06:40.490
As fellow playwrights.

06:42.032 --> 06:44.435
Now, why does the Lear question bother you so much?

06:44.816 --> 06:45.337
Oh, I know.

06:45.717 --> 06:48.621
It's just because of questions of interpretation of the play.

06:48.681 --> 06:56.413
Most productions I've seen do it one way, but logic tells me that I can't imagine Shakespeare intended it that way.

06:58.195 --> 07:00.158
Interesting.

07:01.861 --> 07:04.204
I'm reading, Joe, and preparing for...

07:04.353 --> 07:14.852
This discussion this morning, I'm going through the Oxford Companion to American Theater just to see what Gerald Boardman writes about you.

07:15.193 --> 07:17.617
And this is pretty interesting.

07:17.797 --> 07:18.879
Let me read this to you.

07:20.803 --> 07:21.725
This is towards the end.

07:21.805 --> 07:24.690
His later plays, however literate and thoughtful...

07:25.143 --> 07:27.947
have lacked the theatricality of his first efforts.

07:28.728 --> 07:33.415
So whether Albee eventually will fulfill the exciting promise of his early work seems doubtful.

07:35.057 --> 07:38.262
Well, of course, that all depends on what you consider theatricality.

07:38.983 --> 07:41.046
There are all kinds of theatricality.

07:41.066 --> 07:42.868
There are different kinds of theatricality.

07:42.888 --> 07:45.733
I've never written a play that isn't theatrical.

07:46.714 --> 07:50.580
But you can be theatrical in so many different ways.

07:51.962 --> 07:53.023
I mean, you know, you can be...

07:53.240 --> 07:57.249
sort of noisy and crashing around like Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

07:57.269 --> 07:58.993
I think that's wonderfully theatrical.

07:59.815 --> 08:12.244
But if you're quietly theatrical, like an either delicate balancer all over, there's some people who get disappointed because they expect the kind of noisy theatricality it had before.

08:12.528 --> 08:14.571
No, but I'm not the man of the theater.

08:14.591 --> 08:16.934
I've never written a play that isn't theatrical.

08:17.214 --> 08:17.855
Yeah.

08:17.875 --> 08:25.965
Well, I think this book is 1984, and he suggests that you may not achieve your early promise.

08:26.025 --> 08:31.311
And here, of course, we have what many regard as one of your great plays now playing in London.

08:31.352 --> 08:33.815
Well, he's just going to have to revise his book.

08:33.835 --> 08:34.055
Yeah.

08:34.355 --> 08:40.543
But, I mean, do you feel a bit of satisfaction when people say something wrong?

08:40.692 --> 08:48.341
No, I wish they wouldn't make judgments prematurely, and I wish they wouldn't do sweeping generalizations.

08:49.482 --> 08:56.189
And it's kind of fun when somebody like me can probably take that quote and make fun of it and print it.

08:56.209 --> 09:01.275
I don't think anybody should really be writing about a person's career until the career is over.

09:01.315 --> 09:05.059
I mean, I've written 22 plays.

09:05.360 --> 09:07.442
With any luck, I'll write another 20.

09:07.996 --> 09:13.346
And then, when I die, then it's time to start examining.

09:13.366 --> 09:15.991
Do you see it as a corpus every... Oh, sure.

09:16.271 --> 09:17.353
It must be, of course.

09:18.135 --> 09:20.078
Yeah.

09:20.219 --> 09:29.616
And that... It all ties together in some way, and the total statement is more important than trying to make value judgments about work in progress.

09:29.663 --> 09:36.052
So it is a synergistic kind of a thing, that the sum is greater than the parts, perhaps.

09:36.132 --> 09:37.974
No, it was easily as equal.

09:41.639 --> 09:46.406
Louise Nevelson once told me that she considered, she made hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of sculptures.

09:46.966 --> 09:48.168
She said it's all one piece.

09:49.410 --> 09:50.091
That's wonderful.

09:50.712 --> 09:52.895
Who is that again, I'm sorry?

09:52.915 --> 09:53.555
Louise Nevelson.

09:53.575 --> 09:54.677
Louise Nevelson, I'm sorry.

09:55.338 --> 09:58.422
I know who she is, I just didn't hear it the first time.

09:59.212 --> 10:10.584
What do you tell, I mean, I'm sure everybody, I know I write about books and authors, and I've just finished writing my own book when they're just thankfully forthcoming next year.

10:10.604 --> 10:12.526
Oh, sorry, what's it about?

10:12.546 --> 10:14.748
It's actually, my interest here, it's about collecting.

10:14.788 --> 10:19.653
It's about the passion for, it's about bibliomania, actually.

10:20.094 --> 10:21.635
I do it with paintings and scopes.

10:21.655 --> 10:26.400
I understand, yeah, that you have... I don't even think of it as collecting, I just think of it as accumulating.

10:26.633 --> 10:27.114
Really?

10:27.835 --> 10:27.935
Yeah.

10:27.955 --> 10:29.017
No, there must be a focus.

10:29.097 --> 10:37.510
The accumulators... I'm so bored with these art collectors who are so self-conscious about what they collect.

10:37.570 --> 10:42.177
I just like to surround myself with stuff that I've used to.

10:42.197 --> 10:45.983
So I just don't like the term collector for art anyway.

10:46.945 --> 10:47.666
It's too pretentious.

10:47.926 --> 10:52.894
I was at that sale last week in New York at Christie's.

10:53.515 --> 10:57.080
when the Leonardo da Vinci Codex went for $31 million.

10:57.841 --> 10:59.003
Was there any good?

10:59.183 --> 11:00.385
If you can believe it, yeah.

11:00.405 --> 11:07.135
And the advances were, this is what blew everybody away, is the advances were in million-dollar increments.

11:07.575 --> 11:08.356
Oh, that's nice.

11:08.737 --> 11:09.418
Did you look at it?

11:09.438 --> 11:10.239
Was there any good?

11:10.299 --> 11:10.860
It's beautiful.

11:10.880 --> 11:13.804
They put out a gorgeous catalog of it.

11:14.064 --> 11:17.149
But, I mean, the pre-sale estimate was $10 million.

11:17.730 --> 11:17.970
Right.

11:18.271 --> 11:21.015
And I don't know if you were probably in England.

11:21.055 --> 11:22.778
Bill Gates was the... Yeah, yeah, I know.

11:22.798 --> 11:24.500
Well, I mean, he's got more money than he knows what to do.

11:24.520 --> 11:27.184
Yeah, this is like one day's worth of, you know... Exactly.

11:27.205 --> 11:29.708
That's interest on a month to visit.

11:30.530 --> 11:30.830
That's right.

11:30.850 --> 11:38.962
But I guess an overriding question for me is, I know how hard it is to get a book published.

11:40.284 --> 11:45.392
To get a play produced has to be a thousand times harder.

11:45.912 --> 11:48.555
Well, it depends, of course, on the same with a book.

11:48.575 --> 12:01.429
If you want a big, massive publishing house with a massive advertising campaign, that's a lot harder than a small publishing house that just puts out a thousand copies.

12:01.509 --> 12:04.993
It's a great deal harder for the blockbuster.

12:06.214 --> 12:10.519
And the work is usually worse, of course, with the blockbuster.

12:10.955 --> 12:13.378
It depends on where you want to get a play produced.

12:13.819 --> 12:16.762
I've never had any trouble getting plays of mine produced.

12:17.624 --> 12:21.629
Yeah, but you're the dominant American playwright, too.

12:21.649 --> 12:22.550
It's tougher even for me.

12:22.570 --> 12:24.052
I have to go far afield.

12:24.232 --> 12:28.177
Nobody's wanted to produce a play of mine on Broadway now for 15 years.

12:29.018 --> 12:32.102
And even when Three Tall Women opened off-Broadway,

12:32.960 --> 12:34.182
and got great reviews.

12:34.322 --> 12:38.628
Nobody, none of the Broadway theater owners wanted to take it and put it on Broadway.

12:38.908 --> 12:41.692
Do you have an understanding as to why that is?

12:42.373 --> 12:43.374
Yeah, they're assholes.

12:49.463 --> 12:50.644
Give me something I can use.

12:52.807 --> 12:56.653
They didn't think it would be commercially viable on Broadway.

12:56.893 --> 12:57.133
Uh-huh.

12:57.554 --> 13:01.920
And we're ten months into our run in a 500-seat theater right now, so...

13:01.968 --> 13:02.769
Isn't that wonderful?

13:02.929 --> 13:05.753
Yeah, it would have done nicely on Broadway.

13:05.773 --> 13:11.000
I mean, do you feel any kind of satisfaction in demonstrating that they are assholes?

13:11.560 --> 13:14.504
Well, it's nice to stick your tongue out at people every once in a while.

13:15.525 --> 13:19.410
It would be nicer if they'd learned something, but they don't.

13:19.491 --> 13:22.635
But there's a deeper problem here, isn't there, though?

13:23.776 --> 13:27.621
It's a comment on what they do put on Broadway, isn't it?

13:27.922 --> 13:33.388
They put on Broadway what they think in their infinite wisdom is going to make a lot of money for them.

13:33.928 --> 13:35.870
And now we see Disney coming to Broadway.

13:36.290 --> 13:37.752
How do you respond to that?

13:37.772 --> 13:42.717
Well, I have no objection to the Disney industry per se.

13:43.558 --> 13:53.588
But some of the things that are happening with that particular piece are destructive to the Dramatist Guild and the protection of our playwrights.

13:53.608 --> 13:57.692
It's a complex matter and too parochial to get into here.

13:58.280 --> 14:05.671
But there are danger signs in that thing that have to do with playwrights' royalties and rights.

14:06.793 --> 14:13.923
But I mean the larger question of these Hollywood types, presuming that they can come to Broadway.

14:13.943 --> 14:18.290
In a democracy, people are supposed to get what they want.

14:19.872 --> 14:21.975
So that permits Republicans.

14:22.208 --> 14:23.370
Like Newt Gingrich.

14:24.874 --> 14:25.555
Isn't this scary?

14:25.655 --> 14:26.497
Now that's scary.

14:26.718 --> 14:29.764
It produces people like that, and it produces Disney.

14:31.628 --> 14:33.733
Or Michael Eisner, who may even be more threatening.

14:33.933 --> 14:41.449
They get what they want, but what people don't understand is they also get what they deserve.

14:42.340 --> 14:57.416
To get back to writing for the stage as opposed to writing primarily for books, what do you tell a creative young man or woman who comes up and says to you, I want to be a playwright?

14:57.556 --> 15:01.120
Do you encourage this as a life choice?

15:01.160 --> 15:08.888
I tell them first, come on in and be a playwright if you will feel incomplete without doing it.

15:10.522 --> 15:16.450
If it's essential, then do it, but only if you're really driven, because it's a tough racket.

15:17.431 --> 15:25.081
I mean, you explain, going back to what I said earlier, how it's hard enough to get a novel published or a volume of poetry.

15:25.561 --> 15:31.169
Yeah, and I tell them there's compromise, that this can be pushed all the way, and betrayal, and it's a tough racket.

15:31.810 --> 15:36.816
And so I tell them, be sure two things, A, that you want to be a playwright, and B, that you think you can stand it.

15:37.775 --> 15:46.144
What is the quality of contemporary, I mean, not excluding yourself, how do you look around?

15:46.164 --> 15:50.229
You would ask Shakespeare what he would think of Beckett and Chekhov.

15:50.870 --> 15:54.373
I ask you what you see when you look around among your contemporaries.

15:54.393 --> 15:56.236
I don't want to get into naming names.

15:56.436 --> 16:00.100
But I think we've got an awful lot of interesting young writers.

16:00.841 --> 16:05.706
An awful lot of them are having much more trouble getting their work in front of a large public.

16:06.378 --> 16:12.587
but thank God for regional theaters and the off-off-off Broadway theaters, university theaters.

16:13.148 --> 16:19.958
These people are being seen and heard, but not in the commercial arenas as much as they should be.

16:19.978 --> 16:25.647
I read somewhere that it was... Shepard, who's a good playwright, for example, has never had a play on Broadway.

16:26.568 --> 16:27.309
Never will, either.

16:28.752 --> 16:29.693
Why did he say never will?

16:29.933 --> 16:35.001
Probably because what gets on Broadway keeps getting worse and worse each year.

16:35.808 --> 16:44.221
Where did the people who determined the destiny of what gets on Broadway, where is it that they took the wrong turn?

16:44.862 --> 16:50.691
At what point did American theater make the decision to go to where it is now?

16:52.434 --> 16:54.798
I can't give you the date.

16:54.878 --> 17:00.547
I guess I'm looking for a philosophic... It's the dead hand of commerce is what it is.

17:00.567 --> 17:01.208
That's...

17:02.673 --> 17:11.661
Theater, it must be a money-making business, and the way to make money is never underestimate the taste of the American audience.

17:11.681 --> 17:23.171
However, I mean, a serious drama must cost so much less to produce and to mount than one of these big extravaganzas which cost them a million.

17:23.191 --> 17:24.792
Yeah, but the returns aren't as large either.

17:24.832 --> 17:30.877
Yeah, but the risks are... I was reading somewhere the other day that, what musical was that?

17:31.038 --> 17:31.498
Annie.

17:32.693 --> 17:38.703
which is not one of the worst ones, you know, it's tolerable, has made $300 million.

17:39.724 --> 17:40.125
Geez.

17:40.446 --> 17:41.127
Think about that.

17:41.567 --> 17:41.928
Wow.

17:42.349 --> 17:50.422
A straight play is never going to make anything near that because it's not going to be done in every theater around the country the way the musicals are.

17:50.622 --> 17:52.525
People love musicals in America.

17:53.066 --> 17:58.735
They go to the theater because they can listen to tunes and not have to think.

18:00.200 --> 18:09.009
This is kind of, this is a sad commentary on, of course, we go back to Bill Gates and what he represents and, you know, whether or not there will be books.

18:09.029 --> 18:18.138
It's really a sad commentary on the way our kids are educated, the way people are led to want less than they should from their arts.

18:19.660 --> 18:21.782
I did an interview recently with Harold Bloom.

18:22.002 --> 18:26.427
He's convinced that literature, and he teaches at Yale,

18:26.963 --> 18:36.212
He said he can't retire because he's so concerned that there are so few people left teaching literature that it's not going to be taught.

18:36.272 --> 18:39.415
People may not even have courses in Shakespeare.

18:39.896 --> 18:42.718
It may be part of a survey course.

18:43.840 --> 18:47.904
He's concerned that Dante will only be read by specialists.

18:50.046 --> 18:56.532
I teach playwriting at the University of Houston, and I've got some talented kids there.

18:57.085 --> 19:00.770
But they come to my courses filled with amazing ignorance.

19:01.491 --> 19:01.791
Wow.

19:02.813 --> 19:04.114
They haven't read Chekhov.

19:04.174 --> 19:05.456
They haven't read Beckett.

19:06.397 --> 19:07.078
They don't know.

19:08.440 --> 19:12.225
You have named Chekhov and Beckett twice.

19:12.265 --> 19:15.790
I think they're the two most important playwrights of the 20th century.

19:15.810 --> 19:16.130
Really?

19:18.794 --> 19:22.579
I sense that.

19:22.639 --> 19:23.700
Tell me...

19:24.473 --> 19:30.719
I guess when you began thinking about being a writer, the thought was fiction.

19:30.739 --> 19:32.180
Is that correct, novels?

19:32.240 --> 19:34.602
I started writing poetry when I was about eight, I think.

19:34.622 --> 19:34.782
Uh-huh.

19:35.703 --> 19:36.924
Did you have any of that around?

19:37.324 --> 19:40.247
I don't think so.

19:40.948 --> 19:48.194
And I read someplace that it was Thornton Wilder who suggested to you that you might take a whack at doing plays.

19:48.634 --> 19:51.597
Yeah, I think he was trying to save poetry from me.

19:52.558 --> 19:52.658
Yeah.

19:53.768 --> 19:55.470
How did this come about, I wonder?

19:55.770 --> 19:56.451
Oh, I don't know.

19:56.471 --> 20:04.179
I was visiting a friend up at the McDowell Colony, and I carried a lot of my poetry around with me, and I showed it to anybody who was interested.

20:04.199 --> 20:09.964
But did he see some sort of dramatic potential there?

20:10.024 --> 20:11.886
He must have.

20:12.687 --> 20:16.071
Or, as I say, he was just trying to steer me away from poetry.

20:18.233 --> 20:21.396
He could have suggested woodworking probably as easily.

20:21.764 --> 20:24.768
If we could talk, and I won't take up too much more of your time.

20:24.908 --> 20:32.900
I told Janet that I'd only bother you for about a half an hour, so indulge me kindly for ten more minutes, and I'll let you go enjoy the day.

20:34.141 --> 20:37.506
By the way, where is Three Tall Women playing in London?

20:38.207 --> 20:39.028
At Wyndham's Theatre.

20:39.328 --> 20:45.217
Okay, and that's W... W-Y-N-D-H-A-M-S.

20:45.237 --> 20:45.958
Great, thank you.

20:46.358 --> 20:47.580
It's right there on Buster Square.

20:47.981 --> 20:48.822
Terrific.

20:49.302 --> 20:49.763
Um...

20:51.211 --> 21:05.385
This play right now, Three Tall Women, is said to be one of the most personal of your plays, one of the most, I don't know, I read one quote from you that you see it almost as an exorcism.

21:06.466 --> 21:13.814
Well, I suppose it is to a certain extent, but yeah, a lot of it was based on factual occurrences.

21:14.815 --> 21:21.201
But I think what I did was reinvent fact and distort fact

21:21.417 --> 21:23.239
toward dramatic needs.

21:23.319 --> 21:31.106
So while it's based upon a certain person, I think it extends beyond the individual person.

21:31.126 --> 21:35.391
It may be an exorcism, but it wasn't an act of revenge anyway.

21:35.411 --> 21:38.474
I was able to be objective about a person that I didn't really like.

21:40.856 --> 21:44.359
Is this a play that you had been thinking about doing for some time?

21:44.940 --> 21:46.441
Was it time to do this play?

21:46.862 --> 21:51.306
Well, I didn't want to do it while the subject was still alive because it would have made her unhappy.

21:51.640 --> 21:57.328
She was unhappy enough in her last four or five years of her life.

21:57.348 --> 22:03.297
You know, encroaching sinility and illness and fear and hatred and all those things.

22:03.317 --> 22:05.620
A lot of old people unfortunately developed.

22:06.581 --> 22:11.328
I waited until she died and then it broke itself fairly quickly.

22:11.348 --> 22:12.670
I read also that

22:13.983 --> 22:20.729
When you actually embark on the writing of a play, this thing has been percolating for a number of years.

22:20.749 --> 22:22.631
Yeah, but I never know how long, of course.

22:23.472 --> 22:29.237
Because I don't know how long I've been thinking about a play before I've been aware that I'm thinking about it.

22:31.499 --> 22:33.381
Have you thought at all about writing novels?

22:33.541 --> 22:35.523
I wrote two of them in my teens.

22:37.164 --> 22:39.446
And I never plan to touch again.

22:40.207 --> 22:41.188
It's too much work.

22:42.080 --> 22:43.822
All those words you have to write.

22:45.484 --> 22:46.065
Do you read?

22:46.145 --> 22:51.451
Hundreds of pages of description and narrative and all that stuff.

22:51.471 --> 22:55.736
In a play, you just have to put down what people say and what they don't say.

22:56.757 --> 22:59.140
Which can often be equally as important.

23:00.141 --> 23:00.402
Oh, sure.

23:00.442 --> 23:02.124
Now, you've directed a few of your plays.

23:02.424 --> 23:03.145
And other people.

23:03.245 --> 23:04.567
And other people's plays.

23:04.787 --> 23:09.092
Beckett and Shepard and Mamet and Wilson, a lot of people.

23:09.112 --> 23:09.252
Mm-hmm.

23:10.447 --> 23:39.627
tell me a little bit about directing as opposed to writing the creative challenge I guess is what I'm looking for very different crafts of course and directing is interpretive and writing is creative the same way the acting is interpretive now it's quite a responsibility to interpret creatively the work of another writer I would imagine well

23:39.843 --> 23:40.344
I'm sorry?

23:40.364 --> 23:41.365
Do you interpret it?

23:42.406 --> 23:48.134
You translate it, basically, from the page to the stage, and you try to translate it intact.

23:48.194 --> 24:00.210
And when you're dealing, of course, with a living playwright, you can talk to this person and say, is this what you had in mind, or do you do that?

24:00.411 --> 24:01.292
Sure, of course you can, yes.

24:01.312 --> 24:08.922
But when you're dealing with... When you're dealing with Chekhov and now Beckett... You have to make informed guesses.

24:09.880 --> 24:14.886
but trying to be as accurate as you possibly can to your vision and the other guy's vision.

24:17.028 --> 24:18.810
I'll give you an interesting example.

24:18.830 --> 24:26.299
I was directing a play by Beckett in Houston a couple of years ago, and there was a stage direction that Beckett had in there.

24:26.319 --> 24:28.701
And I said, you know, that's wrong.

24:29.362 --> 24:30.263
He shouldn't do that.

24:30.283 --> 24:31.705
The character shouldn't do that.

24:31.765 --> 24:32.806
So I didn't have him do it.

24:34.047 --> 24:35.449
And, you know, Beckett's, you know,

24:36.340 --> 24:39.244
It's practically gospel now, you know, I'm supposed to change a comma.

24:39.824 --> 24:41.867
I've never changed a line of the play.

24:42.728 --> 24:54.342
But, so I made this change, and then I read, about three months after I did it, that the last time Beckett had directed that play himself, that's exactly the change he had made.

24:54.943 --> 24:55.563
What was the play?

24:56.244 --> 24:58.247
It was, perhaps, last tape.

24:58.267 --> 24:59.288
Uh-huh.

24:59.308 --> 25:00.610
But he had made the same change.

25:01.250 --> 25:04.094
And what, could you just tell me technically what the change was?

25:04.114 --> 25:05.976
It doesn't matter, like, um,

25:06.175 --> 25:07.797
an exit and a re-entry.

25:08.458 --> 25:11.563
I said that last exit is unnecessary.

25:11.603 --> 25:12.604
I don't think he'd do it.

25:12.904 --> 25:15.889
So I didn't have him make the last exit and re-entry.

25:15.909 --> 25:18.252
And I discovered that Beckett becomes the same conclusion.

25:18.853 --> 25:19.574
Isn't that something?

25:19.814 --> 25:20.675
That's nice.

25:20.695 --> 25:26.223
Yeah, I mean, that must be quite a... I mean, it's just the intuitive feeling, isn't it?

25:26.243 --> 25:26.604
Exactly.

25:26.704 --> 25:27.745
One playwright for another.

25:28.146 --> 25:29.668
Yeah.

25:30.408 --> 25:40.381
Do you feel that you're, where did I see this in some, but do you, one of these quotes that you are engaged sometimes, you feel sometimes that you're engaged in a battle for the soul of the American theater.

25:40.461 --> 25:40.942
What a quote.

25:40.982 --> 25:42.804
I never say that.

25:42.824 --> 25:44.487
That can't be a quote.

25:44.507 --> 25:51.616
Well, I think it wasn't a quote, but it was, this piece was faxed to me, incidentally.

25:52.718 --> 25:56.803
Well, my concern is trying to get people to

25:57.695 --> 26:04.183
look at the things that I want them to look at, think about things the way I want them to think about them.

26:04.203 --> 26:05.645
The theater is engagement.

26:08.248 --> 26:15.297
And do you feel that the future of the theater in America is, are you optimistic?

26:16.498 --> 26:18.561
If I weren't an optimist, I wouldn't write plays.

26:19.322 --> 26:20.263
Great.

26:20.283 --> 26:23.567
And are you working on something now that's...

26:24.070 --> 26:25.993
Don't want to talk about it.

26:26.013 --> 26:26.253
Great.

26:26.453 --> 26:27.595
I don't expect you to.

26:27.615 --> 26:30.299
I've written two plays since Three Tall Women.

26:33.063 --> 26:37.549
Three Tall Women was first done and I directed that in Vienna at the English Theater about four years ago.

26:38.811 --> 26:39.792
I've written two plays since.

26:39.992 --> 26:40.533
Two and a half.

26:41.294 --> 26:42.756
Great.

26:42.996 --> 26:45.860
Any plans for something forthcoming in New York?

26:47.142 --> 26:52.069
Probably this talk next season of doing a revival of

26:52.859 --> 26:54.482
one of my plays on Broadway.

26:54.502 --> 26:55.463
We'll see.

26:55.483 --> 26:55.704
Great.

26:55.844 --> 26:56.926
I'm not holding my breath.

26:58.188 --> 26:58.308
Great.

26:58.328 --> 27:02.576
And I'm planning to direct or do a Virginia Woolf in London about a year from now.

27:03.938 --> 27:06.743
Just tell me briefly, again, something else.

27:06.783 --> 27:11.571
I've read that your conviction that Betty Davis and James Mason would have been far better.

27:12.292 --> 27:14.035
Well, they certainly would have been.

27:16.379 --> 27:18.563
Well, they would have been different, very interesting movies.

27:19.015 --> 27:25.267
The only problem I had with Elizabeth Taylor when she did Virginia Woolf was that she was 20 years too young.

27:26.269 --> 27:31.459
And Davis was exactly the right age, and so was Mason.

27:32.200 --> 27:36.248
I think it would have been certainly a really interesting picture.

27:37.882 --> 27:39.664
Sir, I'm not going to take up too much of your time.

27:39.704 --> 27:42.729
I think I've used my allotted 30 minutes.

27:43.630 --> 27:47.856
You're on about 27 of them, yeah.

27:48.276 --> 27:50.840
Now, when did you get back from London, just a couple days ago?

27:50.860 --> 27:53.683
I got back from London on Thursday.

27:53.984 --> 27:56.267
Okay, and did you give a talk here in Boston?

27:56.567 --> 27:59.892
No, I gave a talk on Friday in New York at Pace University.

28:01.033 --> 28:05.880
And I came up here yesterday, and I'm giving a talk at 1 o'clock this afternoon.

28:06.367 --> 28:07.829
Then I'm flying back to London.

28:08.730 --> 28:09.812
You're flying back to London?

28:10.032 --> 28:11.394
Yeah, just for a couple of days.

28:11.935 --> 28:12.235
Wow.

28:12.796 --> 28:14.158
And then I'm going down to Miami.

28:14.178 --> 28:15.620
I've got a house in Coconut Grove.

28:15.660 --> 28:18.404
I'm going to go down there and do Thanksgiving and lie in the sun.

28:18.765 --> 28:19.426
Sounds great.

28:19.466 --> 28:21.689
Now, where are you giving today's talk?

28:21.769 --> 28:24.713
Here in Boston, the Greater Boston Business.

28:25.414 --> 28:25.855
Ah.
