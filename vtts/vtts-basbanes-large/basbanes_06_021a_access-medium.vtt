00:14.662 --> 00:16.184
Hello, 3708.

00:16.264 --> 00:22.690
When you hear the tone, please leave your name, telephone number, and any message.

00:22.850 --> 00:23.711
Thank you.

00:25.693 --> 00:26.774
Hello, what's up?

00:26.794 --> 00:28.736
Yes, Marsha Carter, please.

00:28.856 --> 00:30.058
I'm three chief.

00:30.118 --> 00:32.360
I'm down until the 9th of September.

00:32.861 --> 00:34.482
Can I take a message for her?

00:34.502 --> 00:35.423
Is this Ray?

00:35.443 --> 00:35.824
Yes.

00:36.164 --> 00:36.805
Hi, Ray.

00:36.825 --> 00:37.485
This is Nick Basman.

00:37.505 --> 00:38.226
Hi, how are you?

00:38.326 --> 00:38.907
A couple weeks ago.

00:38.927 --> 00:41.209
I just wanted to mention to her that I'd call back and want to check.

00:43.518 --> 00:44.399
So she'll be back?

00:44.419 --> 00:46.562
Yeah, she's on vacation.

00:46.582 --> 00:48.305
She'll be back on the 9th.

00:48.325 --> 00:49.666
Okay.

00:49.686 --> 00:53.512
Those books I've read from you are excellent.

00:53.672 --> 00:56.676
I find those diaries of every one.

00:56.776 --> 01:06.049
Do you still have, I don't want you to go over there and check, but you had a bibliography of Hemingway, the Hahnemann.

01:06.350 --> 01:12.700
Um, it's probably been sent down to Texas, because we sent all the books about books down to Texas.

01:12.980 --> 01:14.583
Oh, you did?

01:14.603 --> 01:14.703
Yeah.

01:14.723 --> 01:17.007
Um... What do you mean, it's to the store in Texas?

01:17.027 --> 01:18.128
Yeah, to our store in Texas.

01:18.770 --> 01:22.936
Um, but unfortunately... I should have grabbed it when I saw it.

01:22.956 --> 01:28.164
Yeah, um, they're in Archer City, and I don't think they've been unpacked or priced.

01:28.184 --> 01:28.284
Yeah.

01:28.304 --> 01:30.047
So... Well, it was priced, huh?

01:30.067 --> 01:30.568
They were already priced.

01:31.223 --> 01:34.507
Okay, I should have grabbed it when I saw it.

01:34.528 --> 01:37.852
That was a nice honeymoon.

01:37.872 --> 01:40.956
But you had two of them in there.

01:41.076 --> 01:42.839
All those shelves went.

01:42.859 --> 01:43.680
I'm kidding.

01:43.700 --> 01:44.641
Yeah.

01:44.661 --> 01:45.503
How come?

01:45.523 --> 01:51.811
Well, Larry decided that he wanted to get them in Texas for some reason.

01:51.831 --> 01:52.672
I'm not really sure.

01:52.712 --> 01:55.556
There was a very nice selection of books on books.

01:55.576 --> 01:59.762
Well, we bought like another 15,000 books on books.

02:00.063 --> 02:07.394
up in Boston and shipped those down to Texas.

02:07.414 --> 02:14.204
So we just shipped these along with them.

02:14.445 --> 02:16.027
15,000?

02:16.047 --> 02:17.029
Something around 15,000.

02:17.049 --> 02:20.434
I did 550 boxes and I packed them up myself.

02:20.814 --> 02:21.295
Who'd you get them from?

02:21.315 --> 02:21.655
From Thomas Boss.

02:21.675 --> 02:22.196
You bought them from Boss?

02:22.216 --> 02:22.377
Yeah.

02:22.397 --> 02:22.857
That son of a gun.

02:22.877 --> 02:25.802
But I don't think, I don't know if he'd ever... No, I've bought books from them myself.

02:25.822 --> 02:26.142
I'm curious.

02:26.162 --> 02:27.244
Are there catalogs and things?

02:27.264 --> 02:28.546
A lot of catalogs and a lot of old stuff.

02:28.566 --> 02:28.686
Right.

02:29.881 --> 02:33.945
At least he told me that's my fault.

02:33.965 --> 02:35.467
See, he told me he had some stuff.

02:35.487 --> 02:36.227
I'm not sure, but .

02:36.247 --> 02:40.732
Okay, well, do you have any books on books in there now?

02:40.992 --> 02:42.494
No, I'm afraid they've all gone.

02:42.514 --> 02:42.594
Hmm.

02:42.934 --> 02:45.857
Okay, no problem.

02:46.017 --> 02:46.498
Okay, fine.

02:46.718 --> 02:48.780
Marshall, we'll be back in September of the night.

02:48.800 --> 02:50.201
Yeah, that's right.

02:50.341 --> 02:51.202
Okay, thanks a lot.

02:51.242 --> 02:53.464
Okay, you're welcome.

02:53.485 --> 02:53.645
Bye-bye.

02:54.586 --> 02:58.610
Talking to Norman Firing at the J.C.

02:58.630 --> 02:59.010
Brown Library

02:59.328 --> 03:02.793
So you're just going to tell me about this Photostat machine.

03:02.813 --> 03:04.094
Is that a trade name, by the way?

03:04.174 --> 03:05.636
Photostat MSP?

03:05.977 --> 03:08.120
Yeah.

03:08.140 --> 03:09.922
We no longer exist.

03:09.942 --> 03:10.303
Okay.

03:10.383 --> 03:12.505
I'll just say once again who you are.

03:12.525 --> 03:16.431
Richard Hurley, the photographer here at the JCB.

03:16.451 --> 03:16.671
Okay.

03:16.731 --> 03:27.185
Photostat no longer exists, and for a while, actually, we were getting materials for years from physical high tech, and they no longer provide materials for this camera.

03:27.245 --> 03:28.086
So it looked like

03:28.606 --> 03:29.907
It was going to die.

03:30.788 --> 03:38.397
And all of a sudden, just out of the blue, I don't remember exactly how it happened.

03:38.417 --> 03:43.462
I found a company out in Long Island.

03:43.482 --> 03:45.745
It provides the materials, the chemicals, and everything.

03:45.765 --> 03:46.345
And it's every bit as good.

03:46.365 --> 03:46.826
It's like corporations.

03:46.846 --> 03:51.150
I don't know if the Photostec Corporation is still in business today.

03:51.171 --> 03:51.791
No, I don't think they are.

03:52.031 --> 03:52.772
But you really don't think they are.

03:52.792 --> 03:54.394
The whole technology, they're better technology.

03:55.083 --> 03:58.408
But why was it so important to get this particular area?

03:58.428 --> 04:01.252
Well, there are better, but not better.

04:01.452 --> 04:09.704
In actual fact, there is nothing as good as this canvas, because the things in the old days were better that way.

04:10.685 --> 04:13.469
This is built about 38.

04:13.489 --> 04:13.869
Okay.

04:14.230 --> 04:16.633
What does it do, then, in the modern view?

04:16.914 --> 04:18.857
The photo status archival is safe.

04:18.877 --> 04:21.360
You can file it with a document if you wanted to.

04:21.543 --> 04:27.831
The reason I know that is because I test the things after they're finished sometimes, and they're after they're chemical-free.

04:27.851 --> 04:33.057
Whereas the new, they still call them photostatic things.

04:33.077 --> 04:34.198
I mean, this is wood, right?

04:34.699 --> 04:35.881
No, it isn't actually wood.

04:35.901 --> 04:36.301
It's not.

04:36.321 --> 04:37.523
It looks like wood, it's metal.

04:37.703 --> 04:39.725
But it looks like it should go on to the Smithsonian.

04:39.926 --> 04:40.887
Yeah, that's true.

04:40.907 --> 04:41.447
That's true.

04:41.467 --> 04:50.959
But interestingly enough, when I was in school back in Detroit, I knew a studio that had three of these on hand.

04:51.783 --> 04:53.305
And we're using them all the time.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.952
So it was very common to me.

04:58.052 --> 05:00.075
I didn't realize that it was a dying breed.

05:01.657 --> 05:12.272
But the new machines do a lot of sort of technically exacting amazing things, but they cannot produce a lasting piece the way this does.

05:12.623 --> 05:14.385
I mean, is it the optics?

05:14.766 --> 05:16.188
No, the optics are wonderful.

05:16.208 --> 05:21.955
What I'm saying is it's always printed on resin-coated paper, and they're not cleaned very well.

05:21.975 --> 05:22.977
They're not washed.

05:22.997 --> 05:24.098
They're not washed.

05:24.118 --> 05:25.680
They're not in shape.

05:25.700 --> 05:26.641
They're not in shape.

05:26.661 --> 05:34.812
They're used for much sort of applications for instant sort of art layouts and things like that.

05:34.932 --> 05:40.680
So you can put our pieces out in the sunlight, and they probably won't change colors.

05:40.700 --> 05:42.462
But you put one of the new

05:42.897 --> 05:55.212
I'm sure they were very happy to give it up.

05:55.232 --> 05:57.895
That's probably the only one.

05:57.935 --> 06:00.539
I'll try to find out.

06:00.799 --> 06:02.361
You're going to tell me a story.

06:02.421 --> 06:05.405
I want to show you an example of this series.

06:07.787 --> 06:09.850
These 12 libraries cooperating to

06:10.994 --> 06:16.539
this is before the year, or Xerox, or anything, to share sources.

06:16.639 --> 06:23.525
So the work was photostatic, and 12 copies made, and each library got one.

06:25.026 --> 06:27.569
Each one picked out some neat books.

06:27.629 --> 06:33.294
It's not obviously the whole collection, so what we did is you identified... Thank you.

06:33.614 --> 06:34.575
Thanks, Richard.

06:34.755 --> 06:39.499
We have to move it to the new way.

06:39.884 --> 06:45.469
But who knows if that happens when we take it to the economy.

06:45.489 --> 06:49.834
But it's so primitive that it, you know, .

06:49.854 --> 06:50.634
Great.

06:52.356 --> 06:53.657
Thanks, Richard.

06:54.318 --> 06:59.663
I should write about some rare book cataloging.

06:59.843 --> 07:00.804
She's a cataloger.

07:00.824 --> 07:02.286
She's running a book.

07:02.306 --> 07:02.406
Hi.

07:02.426 --> 07:03.206
Thank you.

07:03.687 --> 07:06.870
You know, it's a highly tough call.

07:07.998 --> 07:25.922
I'm just looking at some of your things over here.

07:26.105 --> 07:26.986
Yes or no?

07:27.286 --> 07:28.407
Glad to meet you, yes.

07:28.647 --> 07:29.748
I'm sorry, your name once again?

07:29.828 --> 07:30.989
G端nther Buhheim.

07:32.430 --> 07:32.911
And yours?

07:33.311 --> 07:35.012
My name is Nicholas Bersbanez.

07:35.032 --> 07:35.773
It's a Greek name.

07:36.253 --> 07:37.394
E-A-S-B-A-N-E-S.

07:37.515 --> 07:39.636
G端nther has a Ph.D.

07:39.897 --> 07:53.268
in botany, and he's brought over from Germany by the Hunt Library in Pittsburgh, which is probably the greatest botanical library in the States where it's G端nther.

07:53.488 --> 07:56.010
G端nther worked there for a number of years.

07:56.412 --> 08:11.195
with their botanical collection, and they sort of, the catalogue for them was sort of declined, and people was looking for work someplace else, and we were lucky that we had botanical things?

08:11.215 --> 08:21.812
Yes, we have some, but of course, you see, in the period where we are collecting up to 1800 for most of itself, and then I cut a little bit later, but so on the

08:22.062 --> 08:27.230
There we have some of the standard works in the natural history, yes.

08:27.751 --> 08:40.772
So, of course, we don't have any work which, among other things, treats plants of the world, or animals of the world, but the special ones in America, we try to take it.

08:40.792 --> 08:42.475
We don't have them, they are really young.

08:43.777 --> 08:47.884
So, we say the Hunt Library is a Lawrence Barber 19th century collection?

08:48.826 --> 08:51.549
Do you know about the Hunt Library?

08:51.569 --> 08:52.970
The Hunt Family and so on?

08:52.990 --> 08:54.071
It's very well documented.

08:54.091 --> 08:57.655
You look into it as a kind of Pittsburgh family.

08:57.975 --> 09:04.862
Hunt Botanical Library, yes, because the Hunt Library is the building which is the house's comic and mansion.

09:05.062 --> 09:10.487
It's huge, they say, yes, the Hunt Botanical Library.

09:10.868 --> 09:16.453
All the holdings that you see in the two volumes, the Botanical Library.

09:16.771 --> 09:18.253
which you see in the holdings.

09:18.273 --> 09:25.002
But Mrs. Hunt was interested in the history of agriculture and gardening.

09:25.022 --> 09:26.084
Mrs. Hunt, is she a collector?

09:26.545 --> 09:26.765
Yes.

09:26.945 --> 09:28.487
I really need some women collectors.

09:28.507 --> 09:30.210
Yes, I was.

09:30.510 --> 09:34.656
She was an avid collector since her youth she started.

09:34.676 --> 09:41.005
And of course, it didn't work in generic and eminent industrialist.

09:41.125 --> 09:43.108
She was a collector in the gallery, though, is that right?

09:43.308 --> 09:43.688
Yes.

09:43.869 --> 09:46.272
She was kind of like the Estelle Dottini at the...

09:46.555 --> 09:47.476
Yes, Pittsburgh.

09:47.556 --> 09:48.357
Yeah.

09:48.377 --> 09:49.399
What was her first name?

09:49.419 --> 09:50.781
You remember?

09:51.201 --> 09:51.662
Rachel.

09:51.882 --> 09:55.086
Rachel McMillan, master of science.

09:55.106 --> 09:56.147
You remember, huh?

09:56.188 --> 09:57.509
Yeah, sure.

09:58.090 --> 09:59.952
Because that's the first name of the language.

09:59.972 --> 10:10.386
And Mrs. Simon, she collected from her youth even before she married, but then when marrying a rich industrialist, of course, didn't feel so.

10:10.450 --> 10:24.223
getting a present, but also women of this class want a new fur coat, and she got a new offer, or other... Is this part of the university, the Han Library?

10:24.303 --> 10:26.685
It's part of the university?

10:26.705 --> 10:27.926
Yes, yeah.

10:27.946 --> 10:30.789
But it's similar to life here, yeah.

10:31.169 --> 10:39.917
Independently... Independently...

10:40.910 --> 10:41.791
Say that again?

10:41.811 --> 10:42.572
That's very important.

10:42.993 --> 10:47.159
I didn't know that.

10:47.680 --> 10:59.256
As we're walking, just for the sake of my typist and my memory, this is we're walking through a breathtaking way of wonderful... I really shouldn't be on there.

10:59.506 --> 11:02.169
Are those elephant folios, would you say, or...?

11:02.229 --> 11:02.829
Not elephants.

11:02.969 --> 11:03.410
Not elephants.

11:03.430 --> 11:04.771
No, they're very large folios.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.953
Elephants are probably twice its height.

11:07.154 --> 11:12.439
Ideally, I think heavy atmosphere and so on should sit on cases like this, rainer cases.

11:12.459 --> 11:15.302
You don't have a treasure room here, but this comes close.

11:15.322 --> 11:21.428
This is, I've got to say, these are some weapons just there.

11:21.448 --> 11:23.570
What generally do you have in this room, would you say?

11:23.590 --> 11:26.513
This is three-quarters of the collection is right here.

11:26.533 --> 11:28.855
It's a small collection.

11:29.560 --> 11:31.403
A lot of them are upstairs.

11:31.483 --> 11:34.047
I'll show you in the reading room.

11:34.067 --> 11:41.919
Is there quite something of random interest out to me?

11:41.939 --> 11:44.443
Well, you don't call it bindings, per se, do you?

11:47.307 --> 11:50.472
Not that I'm terribly interested in bindings, but I'm not, I believe.

11:50.890 --> 11:52.312
Well, yeah.

11:52.773 --> 11:55.757
I mean, a binding collection has a binding collection.

11:55.777 --> 11:57.099
No, you don't collect bindings with bindings.

11:57.119 --> 11:59.904
A whole library has always been a very substantive collection.

12:00.324 --> 12:02.548
That's an important point that is .

12:02.628 --> 12:09.759
Yeah, this library was certainly the first library to be organized around conceptual lines.

12:09.779 --> 12:11.842
The first American library?

12:11.862 --> 12:13.945
The Air Book Library.

12:14.296 --> 12:16.762
John Carter Brown... The first American rare book collection.

12:16.983 --> 12:17.223
Yeah.

12:17.364 --> 12:27.710
It really is the first American rare book collection to be institutionalized.

12:27.890 --> 12:30.617
When John Nicholson was created in 1900,

12:31.998 --> 12:36.362
the Morgan, the Folger, the... They weren't even close to the system.

12:36.483 --> 12:37.864
No, they weren't even, exactly.

12:37.884 --> 12:42.469
Much later, and the Huntington... AAS might give you an argument on that.

12:42.489 --> 12:43.289
Well, that's different.

12:43.310 --> 12:44.130
That was a society.

12:44.150 --> 12:46.613
I was going to say the Mass Historical Society, too, but that's a society.

12:46.633 --> 12:47.153
But they're different.

12:47.173 --> 12:58.545
They're historical societies, but they're... They also... The AAS is just the opposite of this person in a way, because that's an imprint collection.

13:00.432 --> 13:03.356
They collect books that are printed in America.

13:03.597 --> 13:06.221
That's a collecting concept, not a historical concept.

13:08.043 --> 13:10.046
But we collect books related to the Americas.

13:10.327 --> 13:12.150
That's a research concept.

13:12.210 --> 13:14.373
We don't care where the book is printed.

13:14.393 --> 13:19.621
Nor, if you're doing historical research, do you care where the book is printed, not the book that's got some information.

13:19.641 --> 13:23.407
So that's a major difference.

13:23.927 --> 13:27.372
I'm not saying a word, but what you're saying is very important.

13:27.392 --> 13:28.414
The Newberry,

13:29.305 --> 13:34.631
which actually opened, I think, in 1896 or 1894, started as a general public library.

13:35.692 --> 13:37.634
Fascinating history on the Newbury area.

13:37.654 --> 13:39.896
And then it gradually became a kind of web-book collection.

13:39.916 --> 13:41.979
Well, it acquired other collections.

13:41.999 --> 13:42.199
Right.

13:42.259 --> 13:44.141
So Newbury was not a collector.

13:44.161 --> 13:44.381
Right.

13:44.621 --> 13:45.162
No, that's right.

13:45.322 --> 13:48.966
He wanted to serve the public and open this, like, a public library.

13:49.006 --> 13:50.107
Well, all his ears died.

13:50.127 --> 13:52.630
I mean, have you ever seen how the Newbury came into being?

13:52.947 --> 13:56.070
That's a fascinating story.

13:56.271 --> 13:57.412
Let me see.

13:57.692 --> 14:05.140
When John Carter Brown began collecting in the 1830s and 40s, he began as a typical wealthy gentleman collector.

14:05.160 --> 14:06.561
He looked for beautiful books.

14:06.581 --> 14:14.730
He looked for rare books, Shakespeare folios and Bibles.

14:14.790 --> 14:16.592
He was the Bible collector, right?

14:17.028 --> 14:24.282
No, I mean, we had this wonderful Bible collection, this Popatensian Polygon Bible.

14:25.745 --> 14:30.033
Didn't he kind of go against Lennox for a lot of Bibles, though?

14:30.434 --> 14:38.209
They both began to collect Americana, but by 1846 was when he decided

14:38.594 --> 14:44.282
He gave up, he was collecting, he's got an Aldean collection, I think I mentioned that to you.

14:44.302 --> 14:45.925
Is that something you'll show me, I hope?

14:45.945 --> 14:48.869
Yeah, books printed by Aldus Manusius, who was a great artist.

14:49.009 --> 14:51.412
Aldean's been wonderful.

14:51.733 --> 14:54.557
Well, he was, you know, the one that found as a modern printer.

14:54.577 --> 15:05.793
He did a lot, he was a great printer, he developed a kind of type, he was the first person to print books in this sort of Apollo size that you can carry around in your hands.

15:06.855 --> 15:08.517
He was the first person to realize that

15:08.834 --> 15:13.362
all the different Latin classics were in manuscripts and that they ought to be preserved.

15:14.244 --> 15:20.656
But then John Carter Brown changed his thinking and decided to collect books related to the Americas.

15:20.676 --> 15:21.397
That was a big thing.

15:21.417 --> 15:26.947
That meant he no longer cared whether the book was beautiful, whether anybody thought it was rare or not.

15:27.789 --> 15:32.277
Any humble pamphlet that had

15:34.433 --> 15:38.439
And as you say this, you're holding what you were describing as a humble little privilege.

15:38.599 --> 15:38.840
Right.

15:38.860 --> 15:49.296
But any, you know, this is 1632, but any word in it that relates to America made it valuable to him.

15:49.316 --> 16:01.875
So what do you suppose, is there anything written as to what prompted this change in philosophy and focus for him?

16:02.058 --> 16:02.959
Well, he just did it.

16:03.079 --> 16:04.000
Obviously, we know he did it.

16:04.220 --> 16:06.482
Yeah, I don't know.

16:06.803 --> 16:07.123
I don't know.

16:07.183 --> 16:12.608
It was a tremendously prescient, and it began to collect hemispherapy.

16:12.688 --> 16:16.192
It was something else that people were sort of interested in, like Peter Force.

16:16.212 --> 16:19.235
He was interested in collecting documents related to the history of the United States.

16:19.555 --> 16:20.476
And where was he from?

16:21.897 --> 16:23.539
There's something called Force's Tracks.

16:23.639 --> 16:28.644
You'll see it's a big reprint, big, huge, long reprints of the early American documents.

16:28.664 --> 16:31.947
Very, very valuable, because he can copy down things

16:32.348 --> 16:36.393
to the Constitution and the early states and whatnot.

16:37.174 --> 16:45.703
But John Carter Brown included everything from Hudson Bay to Huego, and without regard to... Origin.

16:45.723 --> 16:50.229
Right, origin, where the book was printed, whether it was beautiful or not, or anything.

16:50.269 --> 16:51.730
Language was nine elements of it.

16:51.810 --> 16:53.492
Yeah, exactly.

16:53.512 --> 17:00.060
And he collected both things printed in the Americas, early Mexicans.

17:00.631 --> 17:04.957
Peruvian and British North American and European books about America.

17:05.257 --> 17:08.241
Do we have the field of himself that offer a career?

17:08.281 --> 17:14.209
Well, there are a few other people who've got into it as well.

17:14.229 --> 17:20.597
You know, there must be this piece by Bill Reese that was in the American African Society.

17:20.948 --> 17:24.873
I actually have the piece.

17:24.933 --> 17:27.716
I have the piece that he read from at the AAS.

17:27.736 --> 17:30.259
I went up and I said, I need a copy of this.

17:30.279 --> 17:31.741
I said, yeah.

17:31.901 --> 17:35.626
I was there when he delivered it, and it was published in the... So he talks a little bit about it.

17:35.646 --> 17:49.302
And then there are... Tom Adams is a good person to tell you about the history of American... So it is interesting that this is the first library of its kind.

17:50.193 --> 17:59.583
And I wonder, did this come about as any kind of a mandate from the Brown family, or was this just something that evolved business day into that?

17:59.603 --> 18:10.415
I mean, he, I can't, I mean, so we dated in 1846 when he made this decision, and then he got done.

18:10.436 --> 18:12.998
I mean, the decision to institutionalize the library.

18:13.018 --> 18:14.320
But that was his fun decision.

18:14.340 --> 18:17.403
Can I just take a look at some of these things here?

18:17.423 --> 18:18.985
You see, I thought you don't want to.

18:19.960 --> 18:34.745
I don't mean to say that, but you know how this is important.

18:34.885 --> 18:42.638
The library changed direction.

18:42.658 --> 18:45.343
Okay, that's important.

18:53.845 --> 18:54.646
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18:54.666 --> 18:56.268
What's the name?

18:56.288 --> 19:02.677
It's the John Russell Breitler poem, John Carter Brown, November 10th, 1863.

19:03.438 --> 19:13.391
And the significance of that was an expression of John Carter Brown as the line of the Bible.

19:14.072 --> 19:21.321
And that's a major role he plays in, not only in helping to build a library, in the tabloid and in education,

19:22.651 --> 19:29.639
Sorry, you just made one statement, but in context with Bartlett, there's always a great collector, and how do you say it?

19:29.659 --> 19:31.201
Well, I just think that it's somebody else.

19:31.341 --> 19:39.890
There's always an alternate case, that is, you have a collector, a wealthy person, but often he's got somebody else.

19:39.910 --> 19:44.956
Humphrey Warnley, for instance, and have you ever heard of Humphrey Warnley's diaries?

19:45.016 --> 19:49.021
He was the Duke of Oxfords.

19:50.302 --> 19:51.223
He was the same.

19:51.372 --> 19:52.013
That's right.

19:52.093 --> 19:53.815
He was just somebody else.

19:53.875 --> 19:59.663
Somebody else also includes booksellers.

19:59.683 --> 20:09.096
I've interviewed many, many very interesting booksellers.

20:09.636 --> 20:16.806
John Nicholas Brown of the class of 1885 who gave this library with its building and endowment

20:17.208 --> 20:31.531
to commemorate the name and work of his father, John Carter Brown, of the class of 1816, from whom he inherited, with the library, love of knowledge, devotion to historical research, and appreciation of beautiful things.

20:31.591 --> 20:32.372
That's wonderful.

20:33.234 --> 20:37.981
Speak to the past, and it shall teach thee.

20:38.001 --> 20:38.963
I love that phrase.

20:40.867 --> 20:51.263
Tom has got not only his own memory, but the family memory, but the fact that Tom Adams' father was a rare book librarian, and he ran a rare book library.

20:51.283 --> 20:51.864
Where was that?

20:53.266 --> 20:55.289
I said, no, I was at the John Fratergown Library.

20:55.309 --> 20:56.531
I was never a librarian.

20:56.731 --> 20:59.416
I just ran a library.

20:59.436 --> 21:00.497
He ran the library.

21:00.617 --> 21:05.325
It was a very unconscious copy of the John Fratergown Library.

21:05.485 --> 21:06.346
And it was to Michigan.

21:06.366 --> 21:07.448
It was an alternative library.

21:08.913 --> 21:18.227
And he was chosen for that job by the first white girl, John Carter Brown, a man named George Parker, didn't you?

21:19.649 --> 21:20.771
So I grew up in that.

21:20.791 --> 21:22.413
And John Brown called J.C.B.'

21:22.393 --> 21:23.215
's daughter.

21:23.976 --> 21:31.467
I have a sense then that there's never been a day where you haven't been influenced by the love of books.

21:32.088 --> 21:36.034
I've been surrounded by them all my life.

21:37.010 --> 22:00.038
We were talking earlier, Norman and I were talking about you have a competition here for book collectors, for undergraduate book collectors, and I said, this is very interesting for me because generally I'm talking to the accomplished, mature, successful book collectors, you know, and I really haven't paid any attention to the developing of the emerging collectors.

22:00.058 --> 22:04.924
In this kind of point,

22:05.866 --> 22:15.956
The book collecting was, when the whole business of profit loaded came into collecting, I began to lose interest in these masters.

22:15.976 --> 22:26.707
These guys who, and there were dealers like Johnny Fleming and others who were, and there are now thousands buying old books as an investment.

22:26.727 --> 22:30.210
Anyone who does that, I have absolutely no interest in.

22:30.811 --> 22:34.995
They're not collectors.

22:35.617 --> 22:45.614
The gradation of the people who collect books is a part of their social strategy.

22:45.835 --> 22:49.241
They do it to climb the social ladder.

22:49.261 --> 22:51.765
And boy, there are a lot of those out there.

22:51.785 --> 22:53.929
And there's a number of forms of rather display recollection.

22:54.820 --> 22:59.887
I respect the collections and I respect the people.

22:59.907 --> 23:00.028
Great.

23:00.048 --> 23:07.839
This is the first time I've had that kind of a... Let's talk a little bit about, you did mention that you have always been surrounded by books.

23:07.899 --> 23:10.062
Books have always been a part of your life.

23:10.082 --> 23:14.169
This is a job, a profession that you grew into.

23:14.189 --> 23:15.531
Well, I tried to avoid it.

23:15.551 --> 23:16.171
Is that right?

23:16.893 --> 23:22.361
After the war, when I got out of the Navy, I tried to go to law school.

23:22.381 --> 23:23.342
I tried it for one year.

23:23.913 --> 23:28.945
My father wasn't all right because he asked me about that.

23:28.966 --> 23:39.692
So I went down to Philadelphia and went to work and arrived and kept to Philadelphia, which was then being run by the sea riding in Philadelphia.

23:39.712 --> 23:40.875
That's been a year there.

23:41.632 --> 23:43.477
getting my hands here.

23:43.557 --> 23:46.485
It was long before Eddie woke up.

23:46.505 --> 23:47.608
I didn't quite know where that was.

23:47.628 --> 23:49.573
Did you talk to him about this?

23:49.593 --> 23:55.489
I might add, Eddie's his pictures are coming with a certain amount of hyperbole of them.

23:57.140 --> 23:58.501
I love everything.

23:58.521 --> 23:59.903
He's a really wonderful guy.

23:59.923 --> 24:03.386
And the job he did there is unbelievable.

24:03.406 --> 24:06.388
But he wouldn't have gotten it down there as soon as it happened.

24:06.408 --> 24:10.752
He told me some stories, though, about finding things that had been lost there.

24:11.093 --> 24:12.974
I mean, did people have forgotten about?

24:13.595 --> 24:14.976
Oh, come on.

24:14.996 --> 24:17.919
Did you ever tell you about Barney Chesnick?

24:17.939 --> 24:18.079
No.

24:18.600 --> 24:24.565
Barney Chesnick was a guy who was running a library when I was working there for just a year.

24:25.270 --> 24:30.536
Barney knew everything was there, and Barney told anywhere a lot of the stuff was.

24:31.136 --> 24:34.299
You'll find him mentioning Barney twice in his annual report.

24:34.319 --> 24:49.736
Barney was a guy who held that fight together from the time where he went to work at the age of 14 on the little Bernard Samuels, when the library company had two buildings, one of the one up on Locust Street.

24:49.756 --> 24:52.999
Then they went broke, sold the building up at the

24:53.232 --> 25:03.763
up in Loughlin Street, moved all of the folks down to the basement of the Broadway Christian building, and one for ten, really, again.

25:04.484 --> 25:09.309
And then, of course, Barney, he was a young assistant, he went off to war.

25:11.331 --> 25:16.277
And he came back, right back to where he went to college.

25:16.857 --> 25:19.560
The entire education was placed in that building.

25:21.160 --> 25:34.037
The Free Library took it over and administered it, and explained that you'd one wing of it as a branch library for the Free Library in South Philadelphia.

25:34.097 --> 25:38.643
But Barney had to run that, too.

25:38.663 --> 25:50.458
But long back, right after the war, while some of the more responsible Philadelphia trustees, responsible for the Philadelphia trustees and unusual animals,

25:52.025 --> 25:57.831
decided that they ought to do something about it.

25:57.851 --> 26:03.756
And they brought into the free library a man from the Spanish, titled Assistant Librarian for Research.

26:03.776 --> 26:05.078
His name was John H. Howells.

26:05.859 --> 26:16.449
He was a teacher who taught history through Mr. Delaware, a very, very flamboyant wealthy.

26:16.469 --> 26:19.652
And Jack had some responsibility for

26:20.375 --> 26:25.902
trying to stir up the search interest in the collections of the library company.

26:25.922 --> 26:29.726
He thought that Austin Gray had been a guy just before the war.

26:30.928 --> 26:44.564
He had been a librarian in the early of the 1930s, a former history professor at Game Bar.

26:44.644 --> 26:47.648
Anyway, I'll get off on the set.

26:48.320 --> 26:55.310
As the trustees began to realize that they needed to do something... The trustees up here?

26:55.330 --> 27:03.822
No, the trustees of the library came out now, who had hired the library to run the place for them.

27:03.922 --> 27:11.273
About that time, the doctor died, and the plane did not get along with the film.

27:12.383 --> 27:14.705
He made that very clear.

27:15.006 --> 27:20.932
In fact, he's written a little pamphlet about that, but he still doesn't know whether or not he's going to publish it.

27:21.192 --> 27:23.374
Part of his book is he wasn't allowed to publish it.

27:23.895 --> 27:26.177
He still wants to publish it.

27:26.197 --> 27:27.478
He's being advised not to.

27:27.578 --> 27:33.024
It's very hostile.

27:34.405 --> 27:41.833
Anyway, about that time, the president was in court, the lively company.

27:41.915 --> 27:49.422
a man named Nicholas Fiddle-Waylock, who was also an assistant in the Historical Society.

27:49.442 --> 27:55.027
But the first time they had a president of the board who really understood the significance of research.

27:56.349 --> 28:01.934
And Eddie was brought on board first as a consultant.

28:01.954 --> 28:08.260
And then they had a blue ribbon panel of experts come down and surveyed the situation.

28:09.100 --> 28:12.003
And now that grew the decision to separate.

28:12.143 --> 28:30.243
And, of course, at that point, the bonanza of the parking lot, the old building on the local street was an empty lot.

28:30.583 --> 28:31.464
It was a parking lot.

28:31.544 --> 28:34.888
And at that time,

28:35.290 --> 28:40.343
And the economy was coming back to where the parking garage, and there suddenly had some income.

28:42.067 --> 28:44.754
And that was the thing that made it possible.

28:45.335 --> 28:49.827
They had to go down first as the curator, and then there was a white bear.

28:49.867 --> 28:51.190
But I was there for it.

28:51.592 --> 28:56.419
during the period in the free libraries of school.

28:56.439 --> 28:59.544
Everybody keeps in a Philadelphia collection.

28:59.564 --> 29:02.247
Very, very interesting book job.

29:02.267 --> 29:04.130
A lot of very interesting good people.

29:04.150 --> 29:07.235
Not very many people in the Boston area do.

29:07.255 --> 29:07.775
That's true.

29:08.096 --> 29:11.861
What I mean from... Yeah.

29:11.881 --> 29:21.295
Anyway, so you came to... A year there, I went out to the University of Pennsylvania, which had just opened a book collection under the...

29:22.220 --> 29:34.271
with a curate of a man named John Alden, who had been... He was one of Bill... Bill Jackson used to have a hire, a personal assistant.

29:34.291 --> 29:39.076
He would keep the two years, and then send them off, and send them training.

29:39.096 --> 29:44.801
And John was the first one of those people, and he was Bill Todd.

29:45.001 --> 29:47.243
Bill Todd of Texas, and I don't know, hopefully.

29:47.344 --> 29:49.686
Roger was the last of them.

29:49.706 --> 29:52.108
No, Sidney I... Roger was the last of them.

29:52.460 --> 30:07.335
John had started his career, I used to be a British missionary home, where he ran into my dad, and dad got him started in rare books.

30:07.475 --> 30:17.565
He then went to the library for one year, and then went up to the hotel in an open university.

30:17.585 --> 30:19.547
He stayed for two years with Jackson.

30:20.202 --> 30:30.895
and stayed out for another couple of years on the global campus, and then came down to start the real book collection at the University of Pennsylvania.

30:30.975 --> 30:34.920
By that, they've been segregating the real books and building orders for them.

30:36.021 --> 30:40.066
That in itself is an hysterical phenomenon, which I can't tell you about.

30:41.468 --> 30:45.172
At some point, a lot of institutions were right after the war.

30:45.192 --> 30:48.336
It started after the war, started sprouting.

30:49.092 --> 30:49.993
You think so?

30:50.114 --> 30:55.963
Oh, yeah, certainly all the money was being poured into the library, you said.

30:55.983 --> 30:56.884
That's a rare book?

30:57.285 --> 30:58.327
Oh, that's a good thing.

30:58.347 --> 31:04.917
A lot of these libraries, rare books were prestiged, right?

31:04.937 --> 31:09.604
After all, Harvard had to hold the library, because that was the big thing.

31:09.664 --> 31:15.133
Even Yale had a rare book room in the store.

31:15.687 --> 31:31.408
I know books became a great prestige stage of the libraries during that era of gross, and every goddamn teacher's college became a university that had a research library to try to have a book collection.

31:31.428 --> 31:32.830
Well, how do you feel about that?

31:32.850 --> 31:34.052
I think it's unnecessary.

31:34.072 --> 31:34.712
You think so?

31:35.113 --> 31:40.340
Because most of what they would go out and collect were press books.

31:40.360 --> 31:42.623
I mean, the first thing, one of these little

31:43.514 --> 31:45.386
Well, what is it like?

31:45.406 --> 31:47.539
Well, press books.

31:47.559 --> 31:48.324
They're prestigious.

31:48.445 --> 31:49.491
They're pretty to look at.

31:50.095 --> 31:53.240
No one ever reads the books, but they're expensive.

31:53.260 --> 31:56.485
And of course, how do they support scholarship, which is an institute?

31:56.505 --> 32:02.575
Well, the scholarship is to support people studying the graphic arts, which is that what you call a major university.

32:03.656 --> 32:05.279
Well, it wasn't just Harvard.

32:05.299 --> 32:06.701
You had the Jason Brown here.

32:07.242 --> 32:09.546
Well, that's an entirely different phenomenon.

32:09.566 --> 32:11.208
I'm talking about what happened after the war.

32:11.228 --> 32:14.213
Right, but you said there was only Harvard.

32:14.193 --> 32:19.438
Harvard was the only one associated with a university.

32:20.119 --> 32:23.942
JCB belongs to the corporation of Brown University.

32:24.223 --> 32:29.988
No one had already touched on that, but I wonder if you could just elaborate on that a little bit, the significance of that.

32:30.249 --> 32:42.040
He never got caught up with John Farver Brown, and John Lichtenstein was very clear, he did not want his library to get in the end of librarians.

32:42.020 --> 32:45.267
That's fascinating, isn't it?

32:45.287 --> 32:46.048
I wonder why?

32:46.429 --> 32:48.373
Because of the damage they do to books.

32:48.393 --> 32:50.537
Have you ever read my father's book?

32:50.557 --> 32:50.838
No.

32:50.898 --> 32:53.203
Well, you've got to.

32:53.323 --> 32:55.708
Librarians with enemies of books.

32:56.600 --> 32:58.502
And I wrote a supplement to it.

32:58.903 --> 33:02.027
Your father wrote that?

33:02.147 --> 33:04.931
Yeah, that's a famous book.

33:04.951 --> 33:09.477
And I wrote a supplement to it 30 years later.

33:10.598 --> 33:11.700
I know that book.

33:11.820 --> 33:13.902
It's a little article.

33:14.183 --> 33:15.925
It's good for me.

33:16.208 --> 33:24.643
And I wrote a supplement to it, which appeared in the College of the Social Libraries about 20 years ago, called Librarians, Enemies of Books, with two question marks.

33:24.663 --> 33:27.989
Well, why do you suppose that there's John Nicholas now?

33:28.009 --> 33:29.812
I mean, was this insight in his part?

33:29.892 --> 33:31.896
Is this perception in this part?

33:31.916 --> 33:32.778
You look that way.

33:32.818 --> 33:36.985
That was at the time of the growth of the Carnegie Company.

33:37.117 --> 33:42.065
The library with the university, the people, free access to everything.

33:42.085 --> 33:45.170
The book would be used up in the service of society.

33:47.613 --> 33:49.596
The whole attitude is books were going to be used up.

33:51.219 --> 33:53.843
Well, not these things, I think.

33:53.823 --> 33:56.389
That's really very significant, yeah.

33:56.530 --> 34:00.459
That's the whole, that's the basis of the whole concept of the report.

34:00.479 --> 34:07.737
The difference between the Newberry, the Newberry, which you know about in 1900 and the John Carter Barre library is exactly that.

34:07.757 --> 34:11.646
The Newberry was supposed to be a public library.

34:12.537 --> 34:15.000
It's grown toward it.

34:15.020 --> 34:33.762
Just as a library company was a public circulating library, when JCD is a model, after which all of these others... You named a library of this company, I could show you the connection, but we were the first.

34:33.782 --> 34:34.403
Very important, isn't it?

34:34.423 --> 34:36.405
Conceptually, it's very important.

34:36.665 --> 34:39.068
The concept that Don Nicholas Brown had,

34:39.858 --> 34:57.584
and was given form by Judge Parker when she formed his years between 1895 and 1914, when he was here, which he then took to the newly opened treasure room in the Widener Library, which was the first hit.

34:59.246 --> 35:03.272
But we've got in our file documents.

35:03.292 --> 35:04.934
Mr. Folger sent his people up here.

35:04.954 --> 35:07.418
Mr. Hunnigan sent his people here.

35:08.393 --> 35:18.468
See, the research library, which is totally independent of any academic institution, is really basically unique to the United States, isn't it?

35:18.488 --> 35:19.890
No, you really don't find it.

35:19.910 --> 35:24.377
No, that is exactly what the British Library is.

35:24.397 --> 35:26.520
They circulate this.

35:27.766 --> 35:29.430
There was a bottle of their research.

35:29.450 --> 35:31.294
You can't take a book out of them.

35:31.454 --> 35:34.701
When I was there, it took me two hours just to get it settled.

35:34.781 --> 35:35.683
Exactly, yeah.

35:35.743 --> 35:37.687
They're research libraries.

35:37.747 --> 35:38.749
That's right.

35:38.769 --> 35:40.613
The Bibliotech last year.

35:42.558 --> 35:45.003
But that's because, you see, here's a national library.

35:45.063 --> 35:48.390
Well, no, that's because European libraries were always closed entities.

35:48.370 --> 35:53.882
But the British Library does get support from the British government, I believe.

35:53.982 --> 35:56.046
Is that correct?

35:56.407 --> 36:02.700
Yes, but that doesn't make anything about the basic policies.

36:03.136 --> 36:22.191
uh so they may get support from the british government but a support function as a research library not as a public circular i understand that but my point is

36:22.947 --> 36:26.453
This developed.

36:26.473 --> 36:32.302
I mean, you had people like Morgan and Huntington and Folger and Brown and the A.S.

36:32.743 --> 36:33.524
in its own way.

36:33.664 --> 36:35.647
In its own way.

36:35.667 --> 36:38.151
I mean, they're not real books per se, but it is a... Oh, yeah.

36:38.171 --> 36:39.353
It is a, yeah.

36:40.876 --> 36:43.680
Comes along and begins to evolve into what it used to be.

36:44.361 --> 36:46.445
What's the time of some kind of downline or something?

36:46.465 --> 36:47.947
Of that building, is it?

36:47.967 --> 36:48.027
No.

36:48.344 --> 36:57.794
up in the same time our building was built, and the man who built it came from the Rhode Island historical society.

36:57.874 --> 37:02.979
Paul Spickman grew up in Providence, knew the young kind of Brownrider.

37:02.999 --> 37:04.660
It was his model.

37:06.783 --> 37:15.111
But I think when we're talking about librarians, the enemy of books, this apparently is a philosophy that

37:15.985 --> 37:20.670
That was not a philosophy.

37:20.690 --> 37:22.051
My father loved to make trouble.

37:24.254 --> 37:34.985
And all that was, was the old story of the army sergeant and the recruit, even with the mule, you know that story?

37:36.667 --> 37:42.994
And the recruit was trying to get the mule to do something, and he was cursing at it, and the army sergeant came up to him.

37:43.014 --> 37:44.355
Do you understand that's a jibble?

37:45.145 --> 37:46.127
intelligent animal.

37:46.147 --> 37:49.112
That's not the way to get that human to do anything.

37:49.713 --> 37:50.555
Let me show you how to do it.

37:50.575 --> 37:52.438
It picks up two before it hits him over the rear.

37:54.161 --> 37:55.825
I used to do that.

37:56.085 --> 37:58.049
Oh, I had to get his attention.

37:58.229 --> 38:03.178
I had to get his attention.

38:03.198 --> 38:05.903
I had to get his attention.

38:06.344 --> 38:09.229
So you suppose that the Browns

38:10.120 --> 38:23.359
Obviously, they got a sense of the value and the importance, and I'm not talking the monetary value of their items, but they, well, many darn hard of writing began with collecting under the influence of the Roxburgh sale.

38:25.763 --> 38:35.277
And Nichols, I'm going to explain to you that whole concept of the gentleman writer that's also collecting great books.

38:35.297 --> 38:37.680
And he, when he's up,

38:38.504 --> 38:41.688
We went to England, began collecting books.

38:41.708 --> 38:43.130
It was collecting all deeds.

38:43.150 --> 38:48.477
It was a classic, very good collection of all deeds there.

38:48.617 --> 38:54.164
It was probably the first one such collected before the manuscript.

38:54.184 --> 39:04.798
But taking that concept of being a collector, in contrast to, say, Thomas Jefferson, or Samuel Pepys, for that matter, or the Mathers,

39:05.032 --> 39:13.304
for whom the books were tools to do something else.

39:13.524 --> 39:26.182
They had this, I don't know if you've ever articulated this, but they had this concept of these as being physical objects that were important in and of themselves.

39:26.202 --> 39:32.912
And the drama that was John Carter Brown was transferred that concept to a bunch of grubby little books.

39:33.398 --> 39:39.667
Why wouldn't he have contented himself in with copies?

39:39.687 --> 39:43.252
Because it was a physical object.

39:43.272 --> 39:53.306
Why would he have collected a painting if he'd contented himself in?

39:53.326 --> 40:01.498
We haven't seen the whole concept of a first edition as a fairly recent phenomenon.

40:02.170 --> 40:03.051
I mean, the value.

40:03.071 --> 40:06.215
I mean, Peeps traded in his first folio for a horse.

40:06.235 --> 40:07.156
He was not a collector.

40:07.577 --> 40:14.645
But there are other collectors who, even in his own time, the concept of Ed's Pavilion was way, way back.

40:14.666 --> 40:18.250
That's not a reason.

40:18.270 --> 40:19.411
Just abuse yourself of that.

40:20.533 --> 40:22.355
It was like Jefferson.

40:22.415 --> 40:27.081
His attitude toward this film was to be used.

40:27.782 --> 40:30.405
It's really true that the first edition is saying,

40:30.892 --> 40:40.926
is partly a market concept, which is one of the reasons why at the JCB we're interested in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 10th edition.

40:40.966 --> 40:46.293
That is because if you're collecting books with a research value, you want to get a comprehensive collection.

40:46.313 --> 40:51.260
You never know when a scholar walks in, we want to see the 1653 edition.

40:51.400 --> 40:53.463
He doesn't care about the 1632.

40:54.705 --> 40:59.051
So we don't, first edition to us doesn't mean anything more than the 18th edition.

40:59.071 --> 41:00.493
The idea is to have everything.

41:01.115 --> 41:03.218
Whose responses do you think about that?

41:03.238 --> 41:06.764
That's right, because the market... Well, it reflects on what you were telling me earlier.

41:06.784 --> 41:12.172
I said, which books do you put in the most secure room?

41:12.192 --> 41:16.078
And you said, we make no distinction between which books are more rare than others.

41:16.178 --> 41:25.452
And that's a philosophical... Once a book comes in, regardless of how much we pay for a book, once it enters that building, it loses its price tag.

41:26.056 --> 41:30.445
But that's a philosophical... Well, I mean, in other words, it's also true.

41:30.465 --> 41:31.928
The book's never going to be sold again.

41:32.429 --> 41:34.112
It's never going to be sold again, you know that.

41:34.132 --> 41:38.361
Well, it may be, if you get a better copy.

41:38.401 --> 41:41.086
Yeah, but you keep duplicate copies?

41:41.327 --> 41:44.133
No, we've lived off of it.

41:44.173 --> 41:46.798
We've lived off of the depression.

41:46.778 --> 41:47.980
We didn't have any money.

41:48.420 --> 41:51.504
That's a good reason to try to get things in extra condition and so on.

41:51.665 --> 41:54.328
We always trade up condition, but not necessarily.

41:54.348 --> 41:55.910
We will keep more than one copy of a book.

41:55.930 --> 41:59.696
A book that allows the condition, but it belongs to George Washington or somebody.

41:59.716 --> 42:01.278
We keep that, too.

42:01.358 --> 42:03.601
But in general, we're not trading.

42:03.821 --> 42:06.565
We're not thinking about resale.

42:07.326 --> 42:10.931
What you pay for it is incidental, and what you have it.

42:10.951 --> 42:11.892
What matters is...

42:12.243 --> 42:18.312
The great satisfaction comes from somebody walking into the library or writing to the library, whatever, and saying, do you have that?

42:18.332 --> 42:21.157
And you say yes, and no one else has it.

42:21.177 --> 42:22.819
And now you're my last best hope.

42:22.839 --> 42:23.961
Exactly.

42:25.463 --> 42:26.905
Never assume we don't have anything.

42:27.186 --> 42:28.988
We may not, but never assume it.

42:29.009 --> 42:33.275
But on the other hand, your collection is compact.

42:34.236 --> 42:39.264
That is because of the intellectual structure within which it was done.

42:39.284 --> 42:39.905
Explain that.

42:40.526 --> 42:41.187
That's important.

42:42.382 --> 42:47.351
You know, listen, this is the core of book collecting as opposed to accumulation.

42:47.411 --> 43:03.900
Because, John, and I, I've articulated, but I've, in, in following back to history, then I'll be right back to John Carter Brown, his behavior, his mind, and everything, and clearly.

43:04.387 --> 43:29.518
We had this concept that the printed record of the discovery and exploration and settlement of the new world was a phenomenon that was all recorded, fortunately, because of what happened after the invention of printing.

43:32.001 --> 43:32.582
I got it.

43:32.842 --> 43:33.583
This is why...

43:33.952 --> 44:02.372
uh the barracks and everybody else is irrelevant they were here but nobody didn't make any difference it was the fact that columbus came back before it was printed and word was spread out over europe and that that within that structure the five books relating solely to that to that within that conceptual structure now he also

44:02.707 --> 44:05.552
Well, he drifted out into manuscripts once or twice.

44:05.592 --> 44:07.456
He stayed away from manuscripts.

44:07.476 --> 44:09.480
Well, this would probably win ships to him.

44:09.500 --> 44:10.582
But that's a decision, too.

44:10.642 --> 44:18.216
I mean, almost inevitably, a collector does gravitate towards manuscripts.

44:18.236 --> 44:18.657
Well, no.

44:18.637 --> 44:22.686
Mr. Clemence had to because the John Carter Brown Library is already better than the Clemence Library.

44:22.706 --> 44:30.061
This is the thing that sets the Clemence Library aside apart from it, because it has all the bridge headquarters papers and all that stuff.

44:30.502 --> 44:33.388
But the intellectual structure, you see,

44:33.773 --> 44:35.215
It's very rigorous.

44:37.338 --> 44:42.825
It is very flexible within that structure.

44:43.206 --> 44:45.609
It's the exact opposite of the humanities research section.

44:45.629 --> 44:46.450
Say again, I'm sorry.

44:46.470 --> 44:51.497
The humanities research section is notorious in the other way, where they are interested in buying anything.

44:52.138 --> 44:55.722
I don't know how, even the finding key, I don't know how you can have only so much money in your budget.

44:56.063 --> 44:59.207
How do you decide it in the medieval manuscript and a Joyce letter?

44:59.558 --> 45:08.185
You know, just all over them, all over the place.

45:08.620 --> 45:15.406
They started as the treasure rooms, as the treasure rooms of the libraries.

45:15.807 --> 45:16.687
Of the university.

45:16.707 --> 45:18.389
Of the university's libraries.

45:18.409 --> 45:20.851
And it reflects a lot of separation here, isn't it?

45:20.871 --> 45:25.916
And therefore it reflected the entire collective scope of the library.

45:25.936 --> 45:29.038
And the university and the curriculum of the university.

45:29.319 --> 45:33.082
But it reflected what was in the library.

45:33.402 --> 45:36.265
I mean, generally speaking, you talked to her earlier.

45:37.342 --> 45:46.677
I'm a special collections guy at a university, and people say, well, if I have a mandate, a general working mandate, well, I should support the curriculum.

45:47.218 --> 45:48.319
No, you don't do that.

45:48.339 --> 45:49.762
I'm a punk girl.

45:49.782 --> 45:54.870
We create curriculum.

45:54.890 --> 45:58.435
See, that's a fundamental thing.

45:58.455 --> 46:01.560
That wouldn't happen if you were a punk of the university, would it?

46:01.660 --> 46:02.742
See, that's the battle.

46:03.177 --> 46:17.330
But the people of the Houghton and the people of the Bynasties always had with these institutions, they always think that those lobbies ought to be out supporting the curriculum, supporting the general overall collecting policies.

46:17.350 --> 46:32.745
For instance, under Jackson at Harvard, under Wingship at Harvard, followed by Jackson, followed by Bob, and again under John T. Tinker, followed by Lieber.

46:32.860 --> 46:38.148
They wanted to go the route of excellence, which is real.

46:38.608 --> 46:42.034
It's the best library by time in the world.

46:42.054 --> 46:45.819
And Bill Jackson's great passion was the best library.

46:45.839 --> 46:48.283
So he chose certain areas to build.

46:48.964 --> 46:53.430
So the Harvard's collection in those areas were the best library.

46:53.510 --> 46:55.113
And he didn't get a deal.

46:55.133 --> 46:57.576
He was one of the most remarkable ones.

46:57.596 --> 46:59.459
I mean, they doubled their holdings during this time.

46:59.479 --> 47:01.382
No, but the quality of that.

47:02.037 --> 47:05.661
was the quality of what Bill got.

47:06.723 --> 47:10.627
I mean, he... Did he have such a great eye, or did he have great support?

47:10.667 --> 47:13.991
There's always plenty of money.

47:14.472 --> 47:17.976
Well, not there, but you see, it wasn't until recently they had a friend's organization.

47:18.036 --> 47:20.879
Bill Jackson didn't need a friend's organization.

47:20.939 --> 47:24.764
He had his friends.

47:25.144 --> 47:26.386
Roger Houghton.

47:26.626 --> 47:28.348
Roger cries now.

47:28.368 --> 47:29.850
Roger says he doesn't have any money.

47:30.455 --> 47:32.139
He said, we don't have a biography.

47:32.159 --> 47:37.693
Well, a biography doesn't have a lot of money either.

47:37.713 --> 47:47.637
But to get back, those libraries, the libraries that they grew out of a university, the search library,

47:48.764 --> 47:55.611
the primary responsibility for the faculty and the students tried to emulate us.

47:56.612 --> 48:10.947
And for places like the Grandfather Brown, the Antiquarian Society, the Folger, the Huntington, the Clemens, our primary responsibility is the field of scholarship we have taken as our responsibility.

48:11.007 --> 48:12.428
That's our primary responsibility.

48:12.649 --> 48:15.852
The reader comes separate.

48:15.983 --> 48:17.966
Nobody's ever said that.

48:17.986 --> 48:19.128
He's a second guy.

48:19.148 --> 48:21.331
He's a very important guy.

48:21.371 --> 48:22.493
But he comes second.

48:23.755 --> 48:26.619
The collection comes first.

48:27.680 --> 48:30.745
The collection comes first.

48:30.765 --> 48:40.860
If you have anything, is that the first duty is to collect and preserve posterity.

48:41.279 --> 48:47.113
any publication, any printed work related to the history of the Americas before about 1830.

48:48.235 --> 48:53.728
And if you ran out of money totally, you would lock the doors and preserve that collection.

48:53.788 --> 48:55.713
So it's there five hundred years from now.

48:55.733 --> 48:57.938
Then the second goal is the promotion of research.

48:59.065 --> 49:01.708
Which you do collectively.

49:01.728 --> 49:07.215
Which you do as a selectively punctuation thing.

49:07.235 --> 49:14.485
You don't want to come in there, there's a fellowship program, and these people are selected.

49:14.665 --> 49:15.626
They apply.

49:15.646 --> 49:20.072
They apply, and they're reviewed, and they're selected because of their qualification.

49:20.092 --> 49:22.675
Now this is not open, I gather, to the students.

49:22.715 --> 49:25.579
The library is open to any one of these students.

49:25.559 --> 49:31.004
The library is, how do I put that?

49:32.286 --> 49:36.790
The library is, how do I put that word?

49:37.391 --> 49:42.155
No, no, no, no, it's a need for the materials.

49:42.175 --> 49:43.857
Need is a serious word.

49:43.937 --> 49:50.263
No, but I had to work today, and I wanted the machine to pick that up, and that pay attention.

49:50.283 --> 49:54.267
The library may be used, but need is a need to do so.

49:54.247 --> 49:55.770
And what did you say, need what?

49:56.191 --> 49:58.517
I said, but need is a serious word.

49:59.980 --> 50:01.122
May be need.

50:01.142 --> 50:02.946
May be need.

50:03.007 --> 50:05.372
They have no right to use it.

50:05.452 --> 50:08.158
Leaders have no rights.

50:08.178 --> 50:11.766
Using that library is a privilege.

50:11.746 --> 50:15.031
I love that.

50:15.672 --> 50:24.224
That's true of any... I think that that's the misconception that so many American librarians... Everybody has a right to use this.

50:24.264 --> 50:27.729
I think any librarian has to operate that way.

50:27.749 --> 50:28.150
You can't.

50:28.170 --> 50:31.054
You have to... Well, listen, I'll shut the subject for a second.

50:32.148 --> 50:45.251
I often, people ask about this often, and I just think, in order to get into the Rockefeller Library, which is the Brown University General Library, you have to be a Brown student, or a faculty member, you have to show a card, an ID card.

50:45.271 --> 50:47.736
That library exists to serve the Brown community.

50:47.756 --> 50:53.606
And if you're an outsider from anywhere, you can't get into the Rockefeller Library, because it exists for the students.

50:54.207 --> 50:55.029
We're just the opposite.

50:55.049 --> 50:56.772
Brown Library is open to anyone in the world.

50:57.106 --> 50:58.469
Who needs to use it?

50:58.489 --> 51:08.512
So people, if a person comes in off the street and says, well, I'd sort of like to look at this book, but why do you want to see it?

51:08.532 --> 51:10.637
What is your... Demonstrate.

51:10.657 --> 51:16.110
Demonstrate that you are engaged in a serious...

51:16.090 --> 51:28.153
I asked you earlier, when you were showing me around your beautiful building house, and I said, well, how long will it take to fill this up?

51:28.173 --> 51:30.858
And you said, well, it'll really be sufficient for a long time.

51:30.898 --> 51:33.323
We don't acquire a lot of things.

51:33.303 --> 51:34.285
I have to get the number.

51:34.365 --> 51:36.007
400 a year.

51:36.027 --> 51:36.728
That's all.

51:36.748 --> 51:39.553
I do that as an individual.

51:39.713 --> 51:49.168
Someone's going to say, hey, I have a collection.

51:49.148 --> 51:50.750
That's where I want my collection.

51:50.770 --> 51:53.794
This would be a collection in New York.

51:53.814 --> 52:04.268
And so you may get a collection of 5,000 things overnight just because you've got that new building.

52:04.889 --> 52:14.242
But generally, our acquisition budget and the market prices and the fact that we have so many things.

52:14.262 --> 52:16.084
I mean, every dealer's catalog we get,

52:17.296 --> 52:25.628
90% of the advertising that would be in our field, and his books related to the Americas, which were 1840, and I don't know what he did.

52:25.648 --> 52:26.610
I have a book catalog.

52:27.792 --> 52:34.382
I never, if I saw the deliverer book down in American or something, I didn't even waste my time to do that.

52:34.402 --> 52:36.705
I go to economics, or science, or...

52:37.124 --> 52:39.289
There's a little bit of arrogance there, isn't there?

52:39.309 --> 52:40.191
A little bit of arrogance there.

52:41.033 --> 52:41.594
You never know.

52:41.614 --> 52:43.238
I mean, there might be something new.

52:43.258 --> 52:46.125
No, because I know how they're classified.

52:46.145 --> 52:47.067
You know, it's close.

52:47.127 --> 52:50.335
No, no, I don't know how they're classified.

52:50.355 --> 52:53.943
I mean, booksellers have this long-standing pattern.

52:53.963 --> 52:55.707
And Americana...

52:55.687 --> 52:58.971
It was defined by our catalog, our concept.

52:58.991 --> 52:59.872
So that's what they use.

52:59.892 --> 53:00.973
You define America.

53:00.993 --> 53:03.376
You know, I'm talking about why we didn't.

53:03.396 --> 53:10.243
But so what I did, what my predecessor did, was keep pushing our financial funders.

53:10.263 --> 53:18.353
Because I would, as Americana, it was basically discovery and exploration.

53:18.533 --> 53:23.899
A new catalog by an American orphan or something.

53:23.919 --> 53:24.900
But what I would...

53:25.268 --> 53:33.440
but he went out and bought an enormous collection relating to the Scots Darien Company.

53:33.460 --> 53:35.804
This was in 1904.

53:36.024 --> 53:46.199
Now, the Scots Darien Company was an attempt on part of a bunch of Scotsmen to establish a Scottish colony in America.

53:46.219 --> 53:51.247
They did it down in Darien, down in Panama.

53:51.287 --> 53:52.729
They set up a company.

53:52.749 --> 53:54.011
A lot of people invested in it.

53:54.031 --> 53:54.752
They sent out

53:55.677 --> 54:08.252
expeditions and colonists, and then there was a settlement, a few years of Spanish, and the Spanish drove them out and they all died of disease.

54:08.272 --> 54:18.023
But there was this enormous thing called the Scottsdaleian Tripoli, and it was a lot of Scottish people invested their money, and it went bust.

54:19.252 --> 54:20.715
It was great for him.

54:20.735 --> 54:27.507
It was one of the reasons only for the Union of Scotland and England, because Scotland was great.

54:27.527 --> 54:31.654
Now, Winship bought everything related to that.

54:31.674 --> 54:33.818
Not just the thing of having to do with the policy.

54:34.017 --> 54:40.006
on the financial and political relationship between England and Scotland.

54:40.026 --> 54:43.591
It didn't even mention a man.

54:43.611 --> 54:44.953
And we had a great collection.

54:45.033 --> 54:51.503
He did this in 1940, because this is something that happened as a result of the discovery of Iraq.

54:51.483 --> 54:53.528
That's fascinating.

54:53.589 --> 54:57.559
So in the past year, somebody was here using that collection?

54:57.579 --> 54:58.702
I'm so sorry.

54:58.722 --> 55:04.276
In the past year, somebody was using that Darien collection this year, and he told you about it.

55:04.297 --> 55:05.680
Let's call that Darien D-A-N-E-A.

55:05.700 --> 55:06.001
D-A-R-I-E-A.

55:06.021 --> 55:08.327
Well, more about red, red, red, red, red.

55:08.611 --> 55:11.113
Anyway, Cortez didn't do it.

55:11.133 --> 55:13.336
He was a Zara and a Peek and Darian.

55:13.396 --> 55:14.397
That's right.

55:15.017 --> 55:16.298
That's right.

55:16.499 --> 55:18.240
Saddle and a Peek and Darian.

55:18.260 --> 55:19.221
It's Keith.

55:19.241 --> 55:22.304
The scholar said it was the best collection in the world, the Darian material.

55:22.324 --> 55:24.867
So a lot of this is targets of opportunity.

55:24.887 --> 55:28.490
You don't really know what you're collecting.

55:28.510 --> 55:28.650
You do?

55:28.670 --> 55:29.231
Good job.

55:29.251 --> 55:33.315
My project has a job to know.

55:33.395 --> 55:35.817
But research is going to be 10 years from now.

55:36.252 --> 55:40.599
How do you know that?

55:40.719 --> 55:45.527
And I'm paid to me.

55:45.547 --> 55:46.649
My predecessor was paid to me.

55:46.669 --> 55:47.831
Use your intelligence and your imagination.

55:47.851 --> 55:49.674
Why did I come up here?

55:49.694 --> 55:50.255
70 years ago.

55:50.275 --> 55:53.500
So that was perception on his part.

55:54.362 --> 55:58.108
When I came here, when I came here,

55:58.088 --> 56:00.811
But JCB was limited to the year 1800.

56:00.871 --> 56:07.280
So that made it possible for me to collect West Indian firms.

56:07.300 --> 56:13.387
Now we had a good West Indian firm in the 1800s.

56:13.487 --> 56:21.177
But I said, OK, for the West Indies, we're going to use our terminal data.

56:21.697 --> 56:27.045
The abolition of slavery in the West End is, which is 1832.

56:27.065 --> 56:42.987
That meant I could go out and buy in large quantities of very expensive and enormous English anti-slavery literature of the late 18th century to the 19th century.

56:43.007 --> 56:51.079
In the 19th century, in all the early Western Union schools, I got an one of the Acts,

56:51.295 --> 56:56.243
and I would make a place in Jamaica.

56:57.320 --> 57:05.953
I bought that in 1960-something, or in 1980.

57:05.973 --> 57:10.699
I'm paid to know that that is something we're bought.

57:10.880 --> 57:22.036
This is long before black studies appeared.

57:24.660 --> 57:25.521
So when

57:26.024 --> 57:32.470
The kids began to come around and we wanted to study that stuff.

57:32.490 --> 57:42.800
In those days you would go to the prime Cadillac or the main library, you'd find nothing under that circuit.

57:42.820 --> 57:43.220
Negro Black.

57:44.541 --> 57:50.066
They came in to me and I said, look it, sit down with that chronological path and go to it.

57:50.086 --> 57:54.090
Any book, without any book relating to the West Indies,

57:55.640 --> 58:13.028
So, Brett Jones, who made you figure here, did his doctoral dissertation on the Maroons of Jamaica.

58:13.048 --> 58:14.611
He discovered it now.

58:14.631 --> 58:14.831
Why?

58:14.871 --> 58:15.653
Because I brought that.

58:15.673 --> 58:17.616
You know what I mean?

58:17.636 --> 58:20.280
We're paid to know about these things.

58:21.762 --> 58:26.128
And you still have a cutoff here around 1830 or something like that.

58:26.148 --> 58:28.912
Yeah, we think at the end of the colonial period.

58:28.952 --> 58:31.335
The Caribbean is special to go to 1834.

58:31.355 --> 58:41.409
But in fact, what I would like to see in something we're really doing to have a complete comparability across the entire hemisphere, as much as possible others.

58:41.429 --> 58:49.660
For British North America, we were always connected to 1800, through the American Revolution, through the establishment of the Constitution, and maybe a little bit past.

58:49.640 --> 59:01.644
It seems to me that you ought to be able to use the John Carter Brown Library of Spain, all the revolutions for independence in the New World, and the establishment of the first constitutions.

59:01.665 --> 59:07.817
So like ours in 1787, the first constitution in the Shulay is 1818, and then it's around 1812.

59:08.388 --> 59:17.125
I'm not using chronology so much, but actual phases of political development.

59:17.205 --> 59:28.827
I'd like to have a conference on the revolution for independence in the new world.

59:29.060 --> 59:37.269
It's an intriguing and really, it's mostly important subject, that it's the differences in the development of the United States and the Latin American countries.

59:37.310 --> 59:48.823
They all have the same influence, the same enlightenment influence in the 18th century, and yet, you know, the paths of development are so different, politically and economically and so on.

59:48.843 --> 59:56.772
And of course, you begin with the fact that one is Spanish and one is English, but still I think there's a lot to be said.

59:57.224 --> 01:00:09.427
I like to think of the library as the star of the resource and as the kinds of questions.

01:00:09.527 --> 01:00:12.854
Do you think the library is doing what the Browns intended to do?

01:00:13.374 --> 01:00:14.196
Yes.

01:00:14.276 --> 01:00:20.548
Certainly what John Michael Brown intended to do, because this library was unified.
