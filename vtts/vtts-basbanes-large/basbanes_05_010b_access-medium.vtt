WEBVTT

00:04.452 --> 00:05.953
Okay, we're on again.

00:05.973 --> 00:07.535
I'll give you the answer.

00:07.595 --> 00:08.916
I don't know what's the question.

00:10.138 --> 00:11.399
Okay, sounds fair.

00:12.740 --> 00:29.937
A large concern in my book is to deal with the groups and with the effect in society of designating groups as deviants.

00:30.878 --> 00:32.259
As deviant is the word.

00:32.279 --> 00:33.080
Deviant, yes.

00:33.260 --> 00:35.322
It's what I call deviant outgroups.

00:35.342 --> 00:36.564
Okay.

00:37.264 --> 00:49.016
My own personal experience was from going, from being a member of a, you know, solid, well-established, comfortable, middle-class, intellectual, elite.

00:49.977 --> 01:00.868
From one day to the next, I was on the category of vermin that you could kill, you could do anything to, you could take everything they had, you could abuse, you could imprison,

01:01.490 --> 01:12.706
And that was done by having designated the group that I happened to be in as an out-group and as a deviant group, but not quite human.

01:14.308 --> 01:22.160
And this, of course, led to the further atrocities that other, you know, people suffered in the Holocaust.

01:22.180 --> 01:30.872
So I was interested from the beginning when I came to the United States in the fact that

01:31.527 --> 01:44.579
Jews were being discriminated against, but not in this extreme way, but that people of color, African-Americans and Native Americans, were in America so designated.

01:45.180 --> 01:59.273
The consequences weren't as severe yet, and they might never be, but they were, in fact, a designated outgroup, considered deviant, considered different, considered other.

01:59.877 --> 02:06.726
And so from the beginning of my work, the question of race has been a very vital concern.

02:08.168 --> 02:28.095
And I have also, probably because of my experience of being declassed from one day to the next, I've had a very vivid interest in class and how class is created and shapes people's lives and

02:28.801 --> 02:30.744
how it affects them.

02:30.764 --> 02:50.832
And so these two themes are very predominant throughout my book and I have a major essay which is the major new work but actually is the result of 30 years of thinking about this subject on rethinking class and race.

02:52.034 --> 02:58.082
Now I cannot and I don't want to define for you in five seconds here what

02:58.552 --> 03:14.113
I have in that large chapter, but I want to call attention to the fact that I think it's, for my way of thinking, it's a breakthrough for me into a new way of thinking about class and race.

03:15.275 --> 03:18.599
And you did basically formulate it in words with this essay.

03:19.220 --> 03:19.961
Yes, I do.

03:20.702 --> 03:21.784
For the first time for you.

03:22.144 --> 03:26.770
For me, yes, and I think in this way it's not been done by others either.

03:27.311 --> 03:41.010
What I am attempting to do is to replace a set of concepts that are treated as separate.

03:41.811 --> 03:42.852
You know, we say...

03:43.270 --> 03:48.217
There's class, there's race, there's sex, there's ethnicity.

03:48.237 --> 03:58.632
And I'm showing how these concepts are completely connected, interconnected, and mutually constitutive.

03:58.652 --> 04:04.681
How they constitute one another and how they're inseparable from one another.

04:04.721 --> 04:10.189
Well, that's an important point if people can be convinced of it.

04:10.642 --> 04:17.613
because it would alter the way in which we approach making changes in society.

04:19.856 --> 04:20.597
That's marvelous.

04:21.238 --> 04:30.913
Okay, and that essay is, I think, really the centerpiece of the intellectual new argument that's in the book.

04:30.933 --> 04:35.540
I show that, for example, a class has always been made up of gender.

04:36.542 --> 04:38.505
It has been maintained by

04:40.072 --> 04:47.962
millennia of marriages of people within their own class.

04:48.703 --> 04:52.589
And that has been accomplished by controlling the sexuality of daughters.

04:54.091 --> 05:04.384
And then it's been maintained by inheritance, gendered inheritance, which favors the inheritance of sons over daughters.

05:05.786 --> 05:08.830
And it's out of those two practices

05:09.755 --> 05:12.479
that class has been maintained.

05:13.320 --> 05:17.366
So to speak of class as though it had nothing to do with gender is absurd.

05:18.608 --> 05:20.892
Class is made up of gender.

05:20.912 --> 05:25.959
I mean, we actually have societies in India and China where they will kill daughters.

05:26.580 --> 05:27.462
Right, right.

05:27.802 --> 05:29.004
Exactly.

05:29.024 --> 05:37.737
But, I mean, we did it too here in this country, and not the killing, but, I mean, we...

05:38.695 --> 05:44.943
We maintained the disadvantaging of daughters in inheritance and in property rights.

05:44.963 --> 05:49.249
And out of that, great fortunes were made.

05:50.330 --> 06:07.352
I have a wonderful quote from Benjamin Franklin when he contemplates marriage, you know, and the girl, and he says, I expected a portion, meaning a dowry, big enough to pay off my debts.

06:07.923 --> 06:09.805
and to establish me in a print shop.

06:12.008 --> 06:13.750
The family said they didn't have it.

06:14.872 --> 06:17.275
So he said, well, they could mortgage their house.

06:18.917 --> 06:20.479
And they said, no, they wouldn't do that.

06:20.639 --> 06:22.381
So he lost all interest in the girl.

06:22.882 --> 06:23.142
Wow.

06:23.763 --> 06:26.807
This is Benjamin Franklin in his autobiography.

06:26.827 --> 06:28.289
One of the fathers of our country.

06:28.629 --> 06:28.869
Right.

06:29.010 --> 06:29.771
I mean, it's normal.

06:29.911 --> 06:30.632
This was normal.

06:30.692 --> 06:31.753
This is the way it's done.

06:32.324 --> 06:41.599
So I think this is a very important essay, and I hope people will think so, too, even if they don't agree with the whole argument, which may happen.

06:41.619 --> 06:43.802
Well, as I said about Shakespeare, read it.

06:44.143 --> 06:46.086
Comment as you will, but read it first.

06:46.126 --> 06:47.127
That's what that is.

06:47.328 --> 06:50.072
I would think that would be a good headline for your story.

06:52.095 --> 06:54.399
Well, we've talked for an hour here, believe it or not.

06:54.439 --> 06:54.920
Fine.

06:55.060 --> 06:57.083
It was very entertaining and...

06:57.282 --> 07:05.531
I enjoyed it enormously, and if it's okay at some point in the future, maybe I could call back and pursue a couple of, it'll be a while.

07:06.412 --> 07:08.654
Well, I'm bringing out another book in the fall.

07:08.674 --> 07:10.436
Okay, and that book is?

07:10.997 --> 07:26.513
The book is called The Feminist Thought of Sarah Grimke, and it's sort of updating of the work I did on Sarah and Angelina Grimke in 1968, and I'm more or less

07:27.117 --> 07:28.580
improving on my own work.

07:31.425 --> 07:37.196
I gave a talk at the University of Minnesota two weeks ago, and there were some people there from Madison.

07:37.216 --> 07:41.925
In fact, they said, gee, maybe you'd like to come out and talk in Madison.

07:41.945 --> 07:43.087
On the book?

07:43.107 --> 07:46.494
Yeah, on my book, my other book, not the book I wrote.

07:47.456 --> 07:49.159
And they did

07:49.139 --> 07:53.785
You know, the whole concept of the library school, you know, is gone now.

07:54.085 --> 07:58.952
But these people from Wisconsin said, you know, we still have a library school and it's thriving.

07:59.392 --> 08:03.417
But all over America, library schools, you know, have been eliminated.

08:03.618 --> 08:04.639
Well, I'm very worried.

08:04.679 --> 08:06.581
I mean, I have a lot of thoughts on that.

08:06.662 --> 08:18.657
I'm very worried about the computerization of primary sources because the people who make the decision on computerizing...

08:19.717 --> 08:22.961
are not trained to know what's significant and what's not.

08:25.024 --> 08:37.502
And on the other hand, the people who are going to do the researching more and more rely on what's on the computer instead of knowing that the computer only has what people have put into it.

08:40.025 --> 08:42.889
I think that's a very, very serious issue.

08:43.730 --> 08:47.494
And one, by the way, that I'm dealing with quite directly in my new book.

08:48.716 --> 08:57.006
At Cornell, for instance, which is leading the world in digitization, and particularly of primary materials.

08:58.728 --> 09:04.675
And in at least one documentable instance, because I saw it happening,

09:04.655 --> 09:14.111
They were actually digitizing some letters, copies of correspondence of Ezra Cornell, for whom the institution is named.

09:14.331 --> 09:21.664
Now, not in his hand, but basically, you know, pre-carbon copy, carbon copies of his outgoing correspondence.

09:22.165 --> 09:30.038
So they decided, it had been decided by a committee there, that the only value here was content, not archival.

09:30.288 --> 09:35.855
And so they were digitizing these documents and apparently destroying the originals.

09:36.395 --> 09:36.816
Oh, my God.

09:36.836 --> 09:37.557
Can you believe this?

09:37.797 --> 09:40.620
Yes, I can, and I'm very concerned about that.

09:41.041 --> 09:44.825
And I witnessed this, and I even had to make a couple of Xerox copies for me.

09:44.965 --> 09:45.166
Terrible.

09:45.766 --> 09:47.689
And, you know, maybe it's a small thing.

09:47.829 --> 09:49.170
It's not a small thing.

09:49.190 --> 09:50.372
It's a very big thing.

09:50.392 --> 09:56.980
You put that together with the Congress reducing the appropriation for the archival project.

09:57.180 --> 09:57.640
That's right.

09:58.081 --> 09:59.062
And what if you're left?

09:59.182 --> 09:59.923
You're going to have...

10:00.663 --> 10:04.646
You know, a society without a path.

10:05.187 --> 10:10.852
You know, and then they will tell you, of course, that, you know, hey, it's all zeros and ones, which is digital.

10:12.033 --> 10:21.661
But you have systems which change, and nobody can... Nobody will be able to read those digital systems we now are reading 50 years from now.

10:21.681 --> 10:26.005
There are things right now that we can't access that were put on cards 20 years ago.

10:26.445 --> 10:27.987
But there's another item there.

10:28.047 --> 10:29.488
I mean, and I have...

10:30.160 --> 10:41.053
spoken a few times at library conferences and so on, but I helped to create a new field of women's history.

10:41.914 --> 10:55.110
And the only reason I could create it is that I could go to archives that paid no attention to women, where the archivist had no idea that he had material on women in his archives.

10:55.951 --> 10:57.433
And I could dig them out

10:57.903 --> 10:59.365
and say, hey, here they are.

10:59.505 --> 11:00.286
You can see them.

11:02.548 --> 11:03.930
Can you give me an example of that?

11:04.090 --> 11:04.611
Oh, sure.

11:07.013 --> 11:13.801
Mary Jones, right, is under Samuel Jones Family Papers.

11:14.001 --> 11:15.563
This is an actual name now?

11:15.583 --> 11:15.803
No.

11:16.644 --> 11:17.485
I'm making it up.

11:17.665 --> 11:22.110
Mary Jones is under the Samuel Jones Family Papers.

11:22.130 --> 11:26.155
If I went into the archives and I said, do you have any papers?

11:26.708 --> 11:55.905
on Mary Jones he would say no and then he would say Jones Jones oh we have Jones family papers you might look now they might have 20,000 items in there they're not indexed after Mary Jones if you actually look there are more letters by females than by males in the Jones papers but the archives didn't know it alright now if I hadn't been able to go into those archives asking new questions and looking at the sources

11:56.307 --> 12:03.094
I could not have made the claims that women's history made, namely that they're source material.

12:04.275 --> 12:19.091
And we now, we had, I mean, one of the initial projects was to start a women's history sources survey, which we made and which showed that in every archive in the United States, there are vast holdings, primary holdings pertaining to women.

12:19.752 --> 12:21.133
But that wasn't known.

12:21.923 --> 12:27.570
20 years from now, 50 years from now, if there's a new field, nobody's going to be able to do that.

12:28.231 --> 12:30.794
Because they won't be able to have access to the primary sources.

12:30.814 --> 12:31.114
Right.

12:31.134 --> 12:40.446
They will ask the computer for something, and the computer doesn't have it because the people who categorize today use today's category.

12:41.467 --> 12:45.552
But maybe 25 years from now, there'll be new categories, for all we know.

12:45.886 --> 12:52.475
I find this now when scrolling the electronic catalog of books.

12:54.038 --> 13:00.547
They will have a category there, but the category doesn't dovetail with the category I'm interested in.

13:01.048 --> 13:03.672
That's exactly the problem.

13:03.772 --> 13:10.982
And so what this will lead to is to a homogenizing of

13:12.127 --> 13:24.149
the cultural heritage that's much more dangerous than anything that the, you know, if the traditionals really were concerned with maintaining the tradition, they ought to attend to this, because these are the real issues.

13:24.751 --> 13:26.854
This is where the tradition is being destroyed.

13:27.977 --> 13:29.399
In a way, it's upheld.

13:29.940 --> 13:34.168
That is, Cornell preserves Ezra Cornell's papers.

13:34.756 --> 13:40.385
Maybe Mrs. Cornell did something of significance, which they're not putting into the computer at all.

13:40.405 --> 13:41.687
Exactly, exactly.

13:41.987 --> 13:43.189
Okay, that's where we are.

13:43.209 --> 13:44.571
I don't know if that's exactly the case.

13:44.631 --> 13:45.633
No, no, no.

13:46.374 --> 13:49.339
We're using this as an example, but that's the story.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.504
And that is happening all over.

13:52.644 --> 14:02.299
And then the new breed of students, you know, their idea of research is to ask the computer to do the research for them, and then they think they've researched.

14:02.954 --> 14:07.420
Well, you know, my students, when they did that, you know, I sent them back to the library.

14:07.440 --> 14:10.224
I said, spend four days, and you know how.

14:11.026 --> 14:13.089
And you come up with the real sources.

14:13.149 --> 14:14.531
Don't come up with this garbage.

14:15.392 --> 14:16.834
That's wonderful.

14:16.954 --> 14:19.317
That doesn't happen so much anymore.

14:19.338 --> 14:20.279
No, that's great.

14:20.379 --> 14:23.764
I realize I am like, you know, like I have my finger in the dike.

14:23.924 --> 14:24.705
That's about all.

14:25.747 --> 14:27.429
No, not very hopeful.

14:27.449 --> 14:28.050
That's wonderful.

14:28.233 --> 14:30.757
It's the only thing that makes me rather pessimistic.

14:31.117 --> 14:35.303
But maybe people will get tired of the machinery too, you know?

14:35.424 --> 14:36.385
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

14:36.826 --> 14:40.872
I still believe, you know, I only live 45 minutes from Widener and I read there.

14:41.092 --> 14:45.579
And what I can find in there by just walking through the stacks.

14:46.039 --> 14:46.680
Sure, sure.

14:46.700 --> 14:48.503
And what you can find by...

14:48.483 --> 14:49.664
Browsing books.

14:49.724 --> 14:50.325
That's what I mean.

14:50.565 --> 14:56.150
I mean, I'll go in looking for one thing, but inevitably the most important thing is going to be next to it.

14:56.270 --> 15:02.516
Okay, I'm going to give you one other little piece of information for you because you've been such a good interviewer.

15:02.536 --> 15:03.217
Well, thank you.

15:03.237 --> 15:04.298
It's been a pleasure to talk to you.

15:04.378 --> 15:06.160
I talk mostly to ignorant people.

15:06.200 --> 15:07.501
Well, the pleasure is mine, really.

15:08.242 --> 15:09.363
And I really enjoy it.

15:09.663 --> 15:12.786
You're kind.

15:12.806 --> 15:13.247
Thank you.

15:13.747 --> 15:16.870
If you get a chance to look at feminist consciousness, right, the

15:17.137 --> 15:18.599
Feminist Consciousness.

15:19.219 --> 15:23.423
You will find that there was a woman named Christine de Pizan.

15:23.624 --> 15:25.085
Oh yes, she's famous.

15:25.225 --> 15:28.469
In the beginning of the 14th century.

15:28.989 --> 15:44.325
And she wrote really what we know to be the first feminist book, a book of the City of the Ladies, which if you look at it closely, is actually an attempt to write women's history by lining up famous

15:44.643 --> 15:47.726
women who have done important things, right?

15:48.546 --> 15:52.830
And it's very idiosyncratic and biased and everything else, but there it is.

15:53.831 --> 15:54.772
But it's the first.

15:55.533 --> 15:56.533
But it's the first.

15:56.553 --> 15:58.015
Well, it's the first we know.

15:58.155 --> 16:04.480
I'm not going to say that ever, because in women's history, we never know what was supposed to happen.

16:04.500 --> 16:06.322
But it's the first on record.

16:06.983 --> 16:14.329
And about, I don't know, 10, 12 years before, Boccaccio,

16:15.187 --> 16:16.148
did the same thing.

16:17.270 --> 16:22.158
He wrote a compilation of famous women, and she knew it.

16:22.518 --> 16:24.141
She used it.

16:25.483 --> 16:41.127
Well, what happened was that in succeeding centuries, I noticed that everyone who compiled lists of famous women used Boccaccio's list, and nobody used Christina Pizarro's.

16:42.305 --> 16:44.387
And I said, gee, this is weird.

16:44.527 --> 16:46.549
Why is that?

16:46.569 --> 16:48.011
Just plain prejudice.

16:48.792 --> 17:01.945
And then I researched it, just these two titles, and I found that Boccaccio's book, even in his lifetime, was reprinted in several languages in Europe and was constantly reprinted century after century.

17:02.666 --> 17:09.493
Christine de Pizan's book appeared in French, was translated into English in her lifetime,

17:09.794 --> 17:12.498
Never appeared again in English until 1970.

17:13.459 --> 17:13.919
Wow.

17:14.320 --> 17:18.265
And was not reprinted in Europe.

17:18.285 --> 17:26.476
So the result is that the authority for the history of women was Boccaccio when it should have been Christine de Pizan.

17:26.916 --> 17:32.784
And her list was by far the stronger list, you would say.

17:33.004 --> 17:34.266
More feminist list.

17:34.286 --> 17:34.667
Okay.

17:34.687 --> 17:37.130
Feminist bias.

17:37.170 --> 17:37.270
Okay.

17:37.503 --> 17:41.308
It was also a longer and more complex list.

17:41.368 --> 17:43.490
I did a computer comparison.

17:43.510 --> 17:43.891
Really?

17:44.191 --> 17:44.992
Did you publish this?

17:45.313 --> 17:45.913
No.

17:46.554 --> 17:57.247
I mentioned it in the book, but this particular thing about tracing the book prints, I didn't do until after this book was published.

17:57.768 --> 18:06.278
When I was at the Huntington Library, they have this wonderful collection of old books, and they have an archivist that helped me how to do this.

18:06.916 --> 18:08.718
And then I found the explanation.

18:09.818 --> 18:20.468
See, I was puzzled by the fact that, for example, I documented 700 years of feminist Bible criticism.

18:22.149 --> 18:31.397
And I worked on Sarah Grimke, who was, in the 19th century, the first and most important feminist Bible critic.

18:32.258 --> 18:35.961
And then Elizabeth Cady Stanton, 50 years later,

18:36.953 --> 18:42.740
wrote the woman's Bible, and both of them say that this is the first time a woman has done this.

18:43.981 --> 18:59.600
And I wondered how especially this could be true for Sarah Grimke, who was a Quaker, and Margaret Fell, the wife of George Fox, who was the founder of the Quakers, had done exactly what Sarah Grimke had done.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.303
She had gone through the Bible with a fine-tooth comb,

19:02.705 --> 19:07.134
and commented on every line in the Bible that pertained to a woman.

19:08.216 --> 19:10.881
And I said, how could Sarah Grimkin not know this?

19:11.583 --> 19:12.485
Well, very simple.

19:13.727 --> 19:16.934
I checked the editions.

19:16.954 --> 19:21.102
Margaret Fell's book never reached America.

19:21.588 --> 19:22.609
Isn't that amazing?

19:22.890 --> 19:23.490
Yeah.

19:23.510 --> 19:25.052
That's it.

19:25.112 --> 19:27.976
Now, this you could look at in your story of the book.

19:28.196 --> 19:29.818
Oh, believe me.

19:29.958 --> 19:31.460
In your footnote.

19:31.480 --> 19:32.641
It's marvelous, yeah.

19:33.142 --> 19:36.206
Well, I think you'll get more than a footnote.

19:36.226 --> 19:37.667
I think you'll get a quote.

19:38.408 --> 19:40.691
Okay, that's really, I mean, it was staggering.

19:40.871 --> 19:45.577
It was staggering to me because that I did not know when I started, you know.

19:46.258 --> 19:48.220
I did not know that that was the case.

19:48.672 --> 19:52.120
Now there's a word that is in common usage called marginalization.

19:52.140 --> 19:53.283
Is this an example of that?

19:53.624 --> 19:54.125
This is it.

19:54.606 --> 19:55.408
This is it.

19:56.270 --> 19:57.673
This is how it's done.

19:57.854 --> 20:00.500
And when you say, was it a conspiracy?

20:00.881 --> 20:07.035
Did the booksellers of London and France and Paris and Berlin get together and say, we'll do this?

20:07.055 --> 20:07.356
No.

20:07.792 --> 20:08.994
It wasn't a conspiracy.

20:09.014 --> 20:09.735
They didn't need it.

20:09.755 --> 20:16.183
They knew that anything written by somebody with the name of Margaret was not important.

20:16.824 --> 20:23.032
So if Christine de Pisan had written under the name of Christopher de Pisan, maybe... It probably would have been reprinted.

20:23.473 --> 20:23.773
Maybe.

20:23.813 --> 20:25.816
This is a much better book than Boccaccio.

20:26.777 --> 20:28.039
It really is.

20:28.159 --> 20:28.820
It's weird.

20:29.040 --> 20:31.403
It's idiosyncratic.

20:31.737 --> 20:34.643
But anyway, so it was a pleasure talking to you.

20:34.663 --> 20:35.946
Well, I've enjoyed it enormously.

20:36.066 --> 20:36.848
Thank you so much.

20:36.968 --> 20:39.013
And I promise.

20:39.053 --> 20:42.139
And I'll also give you a list of where it runs so you'll have an idea.

20:42.159 --> 20:43.182
That would be nice.

20:43.202 --> 20:43.602
Thank you.

20:43.622 --> 20:44.665
Thank you so much for your time.

20:44.825 --> 20:45.186
Goodbye.

20:45.226 --> 20:45.747
Good morning.
