WEBVTT

00:00.031 --> 00:08.921
Do you see this as a risky book at all?

00:09.121 --> 00:10.622
Oh, all of my books.

00:11.183 --> 00:18.130
If I don't see them as risky books at the beginning, I don't start them usually.

00:18.451 --> 00:22.956
Well, I wrote a hundred pages of it and then threw it out and started again.

00:23.156 --> 00:29.903
So it was difficult to figure out how to come at it.

00:30.389 --> 00:59.940
as it were it was always a fascinating story but how to tell it I think was the problem I read someplace that you actually did a television treatment in the 70s early 70s but I was using at that time only one source because I was quite young and inexperienced and I thought non-fiction meant true and that this one version that I had read was the true one

01:00.275 --> 01:03.399
which, as it turned out, it wasn't.

01:03.639 --> 01:07.084
The one you mentioned, I mean, you obviously noticed.

01:08.285 --> 01:08.666
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:10.028 --> 01:20.862
So it became interesting as a novel when I realized that, in fact, people had been fictionalizing the story from the word go.

01:20.882 --> 01:27.210
They had all had their biases, they had all had their own slants, they had had their

01:27.545 --> 01:34.716
They took sides a lot, like the Lizzie Borden case, or the O.J.

01:34.736 --> 01:51.621
Simpson case, but even more like cases that involve a man and a woman in a violent crime, and what usually happens is that public opinion decides the guy did it, but then they're divided on the subject of the woman.

01:51.821 --> 01:56.488
Was she the instigator, or was she a helpless

01:57.937 --> 02:02.042
Bystander, victim, stooge, whatever.

02:02.082 --> 02:13.638
Had there been—and you make quite a point in that the journalism of the day was just deplorable—probably not much better or worse than it is today.

02:13.658 --> 02:17.222
Well, it was very party-free.

02:18.103 --> 02:25.513
Each newspaper had a political stance, and everybody knew what those were.

02:25.966 --> 02:30.190
If you wanted to get a couple of sides, you got a couple of newspapers.

02:32.252 --> 02:33.393
But in terms of the facts?

02:33.954 --> 02:43.203
In terms of the facts, if there were fact facts, such as what day was the inquest, they didn't usually get those wrong.

02:43.963 --> 02:45.565
What day was the execution?

02:45.605 --> 02:48.208
How long did the trial take?

02:48.228 --> 02:49.569
Those are pretty reliable.

02:51.411 --> 02:53.813
But they editorialized a lot.

02:55.126 --> 03:06.566
And they did things that probably wouldn't be as allowed today, although they do seem to go on all the time.

03:07.067 --> 03:11.194
I think my favorite is the guy who said that the not

03:12.271 --> 03:21.802
in the cloth around the neck of Nancy Montgomery that this knot could only have been tied by two people, and therefore Grace must be guilty.

03:22.483 --> 03:24.986
Well, there is no such knot.

03:25.006 --> 03:27.649
It's just rubbish.

03:27.670 --> 03:32.896
Had there been more reliable reports, if the record were stronger?

03:32.916 --> 03:38.903
Yeah, but with all of these cases, with all of these murder cases, what is a reliable report?

03:39.676 --> 03:40.977
Now, what is reliable?

03:41.398 --> 03:42.519
There's what she said.

03:42.559 --> 03:44.580
There's what he said.

03:44.600 --> 03:47.863
There's what somebody else said they thought they saw.

03:48.844 --> 03:51.387
And if you've ever been to a trial, you know this.

03:51.407 --> 03:53.468
Did you hear a noise in the middle of the night?

03:53.609 --> 03:55.570
Well, I heard a sort of a noise.

03:56.511 --> 03:57.612
Well, what time was it?

03:57.652 --> 04:00.575
Well, it must have been five in the morning.

04:01.436 --> 04:05.079
Well, so-and-so says that she saw you in your car at five in the morning.

04:05.099 --> 04:06.380
Well, I guess it couldn't have been five.

04:06.440 --> 04:07.141
Maybe it was three.

04:07.161 --> 04:09.683
You know, just countless stuff like this.

04:10.827 --> 04:11.308
Okay.

04:11.828 --> 04:14.571
But let's say the record was clearer in any case.

04:14.591 --> 04:15.652
Let's suppose, yeah.

04:15.672 --> 04:21.639
But let's say, I wonder if you would be, have been as disposed to write a novel.

04:22.420 --> 04:22.961
I think it helps.

04:22.981 --> 04:23.621
Probably not.

04:23.701 --> 04:24.763
I think it helps.

04:24.783 --> 04:28.206
What I'm saying is, I guess it really suits your purposes that there's so much.

04:28.347 --> 04:29.748
Well, it made it interesting.

04:30.088 --> 04:35.354
I mean, it made it actually quite, at the same time, baffling and fascinating.

04:36.415 --> 04:37.797
You know, I've asked any number of

04:38.418 --> 04:40.881
Shakespeare is a passion of mine.

04:40.901 --> 04:45.926
If you could ask Shakespeare a question, what would you ask him?

04:45.986 --> 04:49.731
Pick your writer of choice about whom there's so much unknown.

04:50.552 --> 04:58.460
Had you been this woman who had these interviews, I mean there must be any number of questions you personally would like to have asked her.

04:58.541 --> 05:01.624
To her, to Grace, yes, but what would she have told me?

05:02.077 --> 05:04.680
That's a great answer.

05:04.700 --> 05:05.100
You see?

05:06.301 --> 05:06.742
You see?

05:06.762 --> 05:08.564
Of course, she's not going to tell you.

05:08.984 --> 05:11.427
If she's guilty, she's not going to tell you the truth.

05:11.987 --> 05:15.931
And if she's innocent, you're not necessarily going to believe her.

05:16.252 --> 05:28.084
So there's always this gap between what might have happened, what the person says happened, and what you think of what they said happened.

05:30.393 --> 05:31.755
I'm following you.

05:31.775 --> 05:32.596
Yeah, yeah.

05:32.777 --> 05:35.461
And she herself, I think, was three different versions?

05:35.601 --> 05:37.845
Yeah, the first version was, I don't know.

05:38.626 --> 05:39.888
I don't know where Nancy was.

05:40.068 --> 05:40.629
Search me.

05:41.610 --> 05:42.812
I have no idea.

05:43.433 --> 05:44.295
Kind of like O.J.

05:45.697 --> 05:46.097
I don't know.

05:47.079 --> 05:48.081
Maybe my son did it.

05:48.561 --> 05:55.472
Well, I didn't know for sure where she was, but I had a suspicion that she might have been in the cellar.

05:56.448 --> 06:03.515
When she was going, I don't know, she was also saying, well, James McDermott said she'd gone across to the sprint, so that's what I thought.

06:03.555 --> 06:10.102
And the third version, I saw him dragging her along the floor by the hair.

06:14.586 --> 06:15.747
What would you have asked her, though?

06:16.828 --> 06:20.112
I guess it's smooth because you don't know who you still can't be.

06:20.132 --> 06:21.413
Who would I have been then?

06:22.094 --> 06:22.354
Yeah.

06:23.701 --> 06:29.829
Well, I mean, had you been the inquiring... Had I been the inquiring person, well, would I have been a reporter?

06:29.909 --> 06:32.592
Would I have been Dr. Simon Jordan?

06:32.713 --> 06:35.296
Would I have been a matron at the penitentiary?

06:35.676 --> 06:39.301
Because there's always... There's a teller, but there's a listener.

06:39.742 --> 06:42.005
And, of course, those things interact.

06:42.085 --> 06:52.358
As you know, having done a gazillion-trillion-million interview, you know that you interact with whoever you're talking to, and that shapes what comes out.

06:52.996 --> 07:04.651
It is, I think, to your benefit that, I think you pointed this out in a couple of your interviews, it does help you that there's a lot that isn't known.

07:04.772 --> 07:05.332
Of course.

07:05.352 --> 07:08.036
As a fiction writer, it helped me a whole bunch.

07:08.597 --> 07:13.243
So where the facts were clear... Where the facts were clear, I couldn't change them.

07:13.984 --> 07:14.985
But you could have, though.

07:15.045 --> 07:17.248
No, no, no, not according to my own rules.

07:17.465 --> 07:19.067
I mean, that's important to point out.

07:19.087 --> 07:20.969
I mean, this doesn't seem to stop other people.

07:21.189 --> 07:22.451
Well, but it stops me.

07:22.871 --> 07:24.834
Where the facts are clear, you know, in many cases.

07:24.854 --> 07:25.254
Yeah.

07:25.895 --> 07:30.981
No, if there's a clear fact, my own rule was that I couldn't change it.

07:31.021 --> 07:36.447
Now, is this a responsibility you feel to the facts, or to the woman, or to all the principles as well?

07:36.467 --> 07:39.891
I think it's a bit of game theory.

07:41.213 --> 07:42.354
A bit of what, I'm sorry?

07:42.474 --> 07:43.175
Game theory.

07:43.355 --> 07:47.320
You know, it's not real if you cheat.

07:47.924 --> 07:55.919
If you're playing solitaire, you can't kind of surreptitiously take one of those red kings and stick it inwards.

07:55.939 --> 07:57.482
Did you conceive of it as a mystery?

07:58.905 --> 08:00.568
No, I conceived of it as a novel.

08:01.810 --> 08:04.696
Do you agree that it's a mystery?

08:05.057 --> 08:06.820
It's not a murder mystery.

08:06.880 --> 08:09.004
It's a mystery about a murder.

08:09.220 --> 08:10.502
That's how I would put it.

08:11.523 --> 08:18.313
In a murder mystery, you would have to come up with the solution or else all the readers would rise up against you.

08:19.314 --> 08:21.718
You couldn't just end it by saying, well, I don't know.

08:22.378 --> 08:27.726
Although, I think McGray has a couple in which he sort of shrugs his shoulders.

08:28.287 --> 08:32.132
He certainly has a couple in which he knows who did it but isn't going to turn them in.

08:33.053 --> 08:34.215
So a couple like that.

08:34.988 --> 08:38.113
But you do abide by certain conventions, though.

08:38.313 --> 08:54.239
Yeah, the murder mystery is bound by conventions, and the clues have to be, although misleading, they can't be completely bogus.

08:54.259 --> 08:56.163
You have to give the reader a shot.

08:56.183 --> 08:57.925
You have to give the reader a shot.

08:57.945 --> 09:01.992
The solution has to be convincing.

09:02.782 --> 09:07.907
So you felt it incumbent upon you to abide by these conventions?

09:07.987 --> 09:10.029
But I wasn't writing a murder mystery.

09:10.290 --> 09:12.412
I understand, but nevertheless, there are conventions.

09:12.432 --> 09:15.014
I had to abide by the convention.

09:15.395 --> 09:18.057
The convention I abided by was—there were two of them.

09:18.117 --> 09:27.487
Number one, the things in the story had to be suggested by stuff in the historical record.

09:28.868 --> 09:32.772
There was a peddler, therefore I got to have Jeremiah the peddler.

09:34.507 --> 09:35.208
You're smiling.

09:35.228 --> 09:36.430
You had fun when you did this.

09:36.450 --> 09:41.476
I had, well, sometimes I had fun, and sometimes I had horrible times, you know, like everybody else.

09:41.496 --> 09:52.110
Sometimes I had the awful moment, none of this is working, this isn't going to happen, I'm giving up, and so forth.

09:52.130 --> 09:57.738
And the other one was you can't, if there's a real fact, you can't change it.

09:57.758 --> 10:01.683
So date of the execution of McDermott, that's known.

10:02.344 --> 10:03.906
Large crowd gathered.

10:04.274 --> 10:05.095
It was raining.

10:06.717 --> 10:07.899
Editorial comment.

10:08.380 --> 10:12.085
One writer, which I actually put in the book, found it deplorable.

10:12.105 --> 10:16.711
There were so many women present, they felt that it was not refined.

10:17.452 --> 10:18.294
Not refined.

10:19.335 --> 10:25.964
And at that time, it would have been very helpful for me to have had Grace present.

10:27.106 --> 10:28.508
But she wasn't.

10:28.528 --> 10:31.412
She was already in the penitentiary.

10:31.628 --> 10:32.629
too bad for me.

10:33.190 --> 10:34.232
I couldn't change it.

10:34.412 --> 10:36.575
How would that have happened?

10:36.856 --> 10:43.085
Oh, you could have had, you know, it's a pretty dramatic scene, watching this person that you may or may not have been having an affair with.

10:43.646 --> 10:44.687
Or that you may or may not have.

10:44.707 --> 10:46.971
Or that you may or may not have helped kill somebody.

10:47.892 --> 10:53.400
I mean, your feelings could be in a variety of directions as well.

10:54.282 --> 10:54.582
A huge variety.

10:55.473 --> 10:57.577
Better him than me.

10:58.058 --> 11:01.624
Phew, that was a close one.

11:01.644 --> 11:03.047
Goodbye, love of my life.

11:03.127 --> 11:05.211
I mean, there's just... I got away with it.

11:05.311 --> 11:12.664
A lot of things that could have happened in that scene, but in fact they didn't because she wasn't there.

11:14.708 --> 11:15.810
How does this...

11:17.140 --> 11:18.282
I mean, it really is.

11:18.342 --> 11:24.170
I wouldn't call it the odd book in the corpus, but it certainly is quite distinctive.

11:24.871 --> 11:27.575
How does this fit into the scheme, I guess?

11:27.595 --> 11:28.576
There is no scheme.

11:30.579 --> 11:40.093
Or let us say, there may be a scheme, but we certainly do not perceive, at least I don't perceive, its total outlines at the moment, because I'm not dead yet.

11:41.255 --> 11:46.563
Thank God.

11:46.603 --> 11:51.390
I think you can only do that total scheme thing with somebody when you have the total scheme.

11:52.692 --> 11:57.880
You know, I did an interview with Nadine Gordon.

11:58.383 --> 12:00.085
made the comparison.

12:00.125 --> 12:04.491
She said it's like walking into a room and seeing a sculpture, a piece of sculpture.

12:05.112 --> 12:12.061
And every book is almost a different view of walking around and seeing the same piece from a different angle.

12:12.461 --> 12:16.166
She almost feels that her whole body of work is really one work told.

12:16.447 --> 12:18.349
I think that may be true of her

12:19.291 --> 12:27.583
She has been very, very focused on South Africa and how it works, how it has worked over the years.

12:27.663 --> 12:40.862
You can look at it from this angle, you can look at it from that angle, underneath to the top, from the top down, into the future with July's people, which I think is a wonderful book.

12:43.226 --> 12:47.492
So I think that can be true, but I would hesitate to...

12:48.215 --> 12:53.062
make that kind of statement about my own work.

12:55.807 --> 13:03.358
The idea of going back into the past, I guess, is just another challenge, a creative challenge.

13:03.378 --> 13:10.970
It was certainly a challenge, and it was not something that occurred to me to do before I did it.

13:11.892 --> 13:12.172
Really?

13:12.713 --> 13:14.155
No.

13:14.371 --> 13:16.294
two historical things.

13:16.914 --> 13:19.338
Actually, I'd done three historical things.

13:19.358 --> 13:22.562
I did the journals of Susanna Moody, which is a book of poems.

13:23.643 --> 13:30.593
I did one of the volumes in a series called The Illustrated Social History of Canada.

13:31.494 --> 13:34.038
I did 1815 to 1840.

13:35.379 --> 13:42.589
And I did a short piece called Marrying the Hangman that was based on...

13:42.721 --> 14:09.943
case in Quebec in the 18th century in which the law was that if you were the hangman or you were married to the hangman you couldn't be hanged and this woman who was condemned to death for theft talked to a guy in the cell next to her she didn't see him she talked to him through a hole in the wall he was in jail for dealing he wasn't condemned to death at all

14:10.177 --> 14:15.544
She talked him into becoming the hangman, because the position was vacant, and also into marrying her.

14:16.345 --> 14:17.847
And thus she got herself off.

14:18.788 --> 14:26.698
Kind of like the convention of an American citizen marrying somebody so they can get citizenship.

14:26.718 --> 14:28.820
Yeah, but what motivation was there for him?

14:30.322 --> 14:31.484
He wasn't going to die.

14:33.246 --> 14:34.788
She must have been very persuasive.

14:35.509 --> 14:37.051
Maybe he needed a job.

14:37.291 --> 14:39.694
I doubt it.

14:40.332 --> 14:41.734
Somehow.

14:41.754 --> 14:42.795
It's an awful job.

14:43.056 --> 14:43.877
Nobody wanted it.

14:43.917 --> 14:46.020
That's why they had these perks.

14:47.562 --> 14:49.745
So I did that one, and I lie.

14:49.785 --> 15:04.406
I did a fourth historical thing, which was a series of poems by Mary Webster, who was before the Salem witchcraft trials.

15:04.967 --> 15:05.427
Before?

15:05.568 --> 15:06.930
Before, just before.

15:06.950 --> 15:08.652
If it had been during, she would have been

15:09.374 --> 15:10.776
she would have been done for.

15:11.677 --> 15:19.906
But she was actually tried for witchcraft, and she got off, but the townspeople didn't like the verdict, so they hanged her anyway.

15:19.926 --> 15:23.190
And she survived Connecticut.

15:24.672 --> 15:29.397
You didn't have witchcraft trials in Canada.

15:29.798 --> 15:31.740
I don't think we had enough people then.

15:31.760 --> 15:33.943
You know, this was 17th century.

15:34.023 --> 15:38.588
It was Quebec.

15:39.968 --> 15:43.132
They had them in France to a certain extent.

15:43.152 --> 15:45.255
They had them in southern Germany a lot.

15:47.118 --> 15:49.181
I would have to look at the back and see.

15:50.062 --> 16:02.098
There were some people, I know there were some people who were thought to be witches, and I know there was at least one who was killed for it, but I would have to look and see.

16:02.118 --> 16:04.041
What a metaphor for fiction writers, though.

16:04.441 --> 16:07.225
Oh, well, the New England one is really unique.

16:07.812 --> 16:15.741
In all of the witchcraft stuff that went on, this is a really extraordinary story the Salem one.

16:15.761 --> 16:18.725
It's astonishing.

16:18.745 --> 16:22.409
Well, and Arthur Miller's, you know, The Crucible, which is now... Yeah, it's going to come out again.

16:22.429 --> 16:23.250
...coming out again.

16:25.473 --> 16:30.799
Of course, what makes that his telling of The Witchcraft Girls is the resonance that it had

16:31.066 --> 16:33.088
the time he was writing it.

16:33.809 --> 16:38.955
Similarly, do you see any kind of contemporary resonances in this book?

16:38.975 --> 16:43.380
Well, as Robertson Davies says, we cannot help but be contemporary.

16:46.104 --> 16:46.684
Bless us all.

16:46.864 --> 16:52.711
No matter where we are setting our books or when we're setting them, we can't help it.

16:52.731 --> 16:58.558
For instance, A Tale of Two Cities set at the time of the French Revolution.

16:59.011 --> 17:03.376
But it's obviously a Victorian novel.

17:03.676 --> 17:05.358
And so it goes.

17:05.558 --> 17:09.182
You know, you have all this medievalism of the 19th century.

17:09.222 --> 17:14.567
You have Idols of the King, which is sort of echt Victorian.

17:14.787 --> 17:16.829
Nothing could be more Victorian than it.

17:18.051 --> 17:20.113
But it's, quote, historical.

17:20.233 --> 17:24.898
King Arthur, Round Table, all of that.

17:24.918 --> 17:27.060
So you agree that...

17:27.310 --> 17:35.604
Well, all fiction is about when it's written, no matter when it says it's about.

17:35.644 --> 17:45.842
So the things that interest me about this case were not necessarily the things that would have interested somebody writing about it then.

17:47.206 --> 17:48.268
if you see what I mean.

17:48.368 --> 17:50.071
I'm interested in the ambiguities.

17:50.372 --> 17:55.501
They were interested in certainties, which they made up even if they weren't failable.

17:55.541 --> 17:59.308
And the ambiguities, in fact, continue in this book to the very end.

17:59.328 --> 18:00.470
Yeah, yeah.

18:00.611 --> 18:07.303
Well, reading all of the things, they were there.

18:07.603 --> 18:11.290
It's just that the people who chose to write about it liked to

18:11.641 --> 18:13.364
not see them.

18:13.905 --> 18:17.371
So the ambiguities actually did appeal to you?

18:17.591 --> 18:21.798
Of course, of course, because I'm a late 20th century person.

18:21.818 --> 18:22.860
Of course they did.

18:24.583 --> 18:28.349
For instance, the lunatic asylum, which she spent almost two years in.

18:30.132 --> 18:33.057
Susanna Moody's thing was simple.

18:33.077 --> 18:34.499
She was a raving lunatic.

18:34.539 --> 18:36.723
She was probably crazy at the time of the crime.

18:36.783 --> 18:37.885
That accounts for it.

18:38.303 --> 18:42.688
and she'll be forgiven in heaven because of having been crazy from the very beginning.

18:43.288 --> 18:43.909
End of case.

18:44.029 --> 18:44.690
End of case.

18:45.811 --> 18:50.576
A later writer in the century says she was faking.

18:51.076 --> 18:53.379
She wasn't a lunatic at all.

18:53.399 --> 18:58.824
A lot of people did fake, at point of fact, because it was nicer in the asylum, better food.

18:59.825 --> 19:02.428
They were treated better, and it was easier to escape.

19:04.470 --> 19:08.074
So he takes a very anti-grave stand.

19:08.240 --> 19:12.266
It's faking, hypocrite, liar, etc.

19:13.988 --> 19:14.749
It is.

19:14.769 --> 19:16.972
And she gets shipped back to the penitentiary.

19:17.092 --> 19:19.776
So if anybody saw her on the violent ward, and I'd believe her.

19:20.417 --> 19:24.843
She'd usually, if she saw something, that's usually what was there.

19:25.805 --> 19:29.009
But what did she really see?

19:29.049 --> 19:31.633
She saw somebody running around and screaming.

19:32.314 --> 19:34.517
Well, I can run around and scream, too.

19:35.712 --> 19:40.637
It didn't occur to her that this might not be what she was really seeing.

19:43.159 --> 19:47.984
I didn't realize that you could actually go observe these people like you only did this.

19:48.004 --> 19:48.585
Yeah, absolutely.

19:48.725 --> 19:49.826
You absolutely could.

19:51.047 --> 19:52.329
They did that in England.

19:52.349 --> 19:53.790
That's where the word bedlam gets.

19:53.810 --> 19:59.996
Yeah, but that practice continued into the 19th century, although with a different gloss on it.

20:00.016 --> 20:05.702
It was supposed to be educational and instructional and of a reforming nature.

20:05.935 --> 20:07.276
As opposed to entertainment.

20:07.296 --> 20:09.179
As opposed to entertainment, yeah.

20:09.199 --> 20:18.168
And you were also supposed to be admiring the modernity and convenience of the arrangements.

20:18.248 --> 20:23.594
Well, the arrangements, you know, the building, the architecture, the arrangements.

20:23.614 --> 20:31.723
It so happens, as I put in my book, that the Lunatic Asylum in Toronto, which had this wonderful architectural appearance,

20:32.733 --> 20:38.101
somebody had forgotten to connect the drain pipes up to the main sewer.

20:39.122 --> 20:51.721
So poor old Dr. Workman, who was an admirable character, when he came in his head, one of the first things he found was that the cellar was full of horrible sludge, which was all the sewage down there.

20:52.943 --> 20:58.591
And he said, that explains all these cases of illness that we have had.

20:58.631 --> 21:01.896
It's also true that when they did connect it up,

21:02.483 --> 21:09.189
They had the water intake coming out of Lake Ontario.

21:09.770 --> 21:17.057
The water that they were drinking was right next to the sewage pipe.

21:17.077 --> 21:18.738
You can't really believe it.

21:19.159 --> 21:21.041
But similar things happen today.

21:21.221 --> 21:24.784
It's just that we're usually in the construction business.

21:24.824 --> 21:30.870
Somebody uses bad cement to save money, and the thing falls down.

21:31.441 --> 21:33.424
You did a lot of research for this.

21:33.804 --> 21:35.207
Yeah, what fun it was.

21:35.948 --> 21:37.169
That must have been a lot of fun.

21:37.190 --> 21:39.313
It had been in so many different directions.

21:41.075 --> 21:46.724
There's one little part where I say, she says, the ladies look like jellyfish.

21:46.744 --> 21:51.070
And I thought, were there jellyfish in Northern Ireland?

21:51.551 --> 21:55.937
Off to the Encyclopedia of Zoology.

21:55.957 --> 21:57.820
Boy, that's the kind of thing, if you get wrong...

21:57.935 --> 21:59.997
Somebody's going to whack you on it.

22:00.017 --> 22:00.998
Somebody is.

22:01.018 --> 22:01.759
They certainly are.

22:02.619 --> 22:04.661
Well, in fact, the warden made a mistake.

22:06.623 --> 22:08.225
Could I have the bill, please?

22:11.808 --> 22:13.770
Oh, thank you.

22:15.111 --> 22:20.176
The warden made a mistake in his journal, which I expect he was writing up afterwards, as lots of people did.

22:21.097 --> 22:26.862
And it's the point towards the end at which he says, you know, Friday so-and-so got the pardon.

22:27.179 --> 22:36.069
for Grace Tuesday, the such-and-such drove her to her destination, this home that had been provided, etc.

22:36.810 --> 22:38.012
What a mystery that is.

22:39.273 --> 22:42.237
Only it wasn't a Tuesday.

22:44.359 --> 22:45.500
It was a Wednesday.

22:46.562 --> 22:49.525
So the dilemma is, do you change it for him?

22:50.028 --> 22:51.890
Or do you put what he actually wrote?

22:51.970 --> 22:55.695
Well, speaking to my rules, I put what he actually wrote.

22:55.735 --> 23:00.721
And, of course, somebody writes and says, you know, that wasn't a Tuesday.

23:00.741 --> 23:01.622
I really commend you.

23:03.164 --> 23:09.633
I just wonder how many fiction writers would be that true to... Well, some of them are.

23:09.773 --> 23:18.043
The better historical fiction ones, for instance, I read a book on Amy Robesart.

23:18.395 --> 23:25.505
that one of Elizabeth I's suitor's wife found at the bottom of the stairs, neck broken, etc.

23:26.346 --> 23:31.833
And she went to quite a lot of trouble to figure out what must have happened, and she presents her evidence.

23:33.455 --> 23:37.441
And that's the kind I prefer to read.

23:37.741 --> 23:42.848
And I'm not interested in ones that just are kind of dressed up fantasy.

23:42.888 --> 23:46.613
Anyway, they usually get the clothes wrong, and I don't like that.

23:47.504 --> 23:53.631
At what point did you decide that maybe a couple of voices would be appropriate here?

23:53.651 --> 24:05.985
From the beginning, I did, because I had originally Susanna Moody as a character writing letters.

24:06.065 --> 24:07.787
That was something I had to throw out.

24:07.807 --> 24:09.930
I couldn't use it.

24:11.972 --> 24:17.038
So I had somebody writing letters from the beginning, and then once I got into writing letters,

24:18.571 --> 24:22.557
I got into writing more letters and different letters.

24:22.597 --> 24:34.576
And it's often a very good and quick way of placing a person, letting you know something of their background and the other forces in their life.

24:34.596 --> 24:47.295
For instance, Mrs. Jordan, who is Simon Jordan's mother, a letter from her, and you get his total home situation.

24:48.035 --> 24:50.618
You know, you know exactly what he's dealing with with his mother.

24:50.638 --> 24:54.461
Did you have this Jordan episode?

24:54.842 --> 25:00.347
Actually, I wanted it to be Dr. Workman, but then I did my research.

25:00.447 --> 25:05.392
I found out that Dr. Workman had only known Grace Marks for three weeks.

25:05.472 --> 25:07.775
He was the guy who sent her back.

25:07.795 --> 25:09.356
So I couldn't use it.

25:09.376 --> 25:10.498
That wasn't going to work, yeah.

25:10.518 --> 25:15.983
No, so I had to have somebody like him with his interests.

25:16.638 --> 25:26.209
And that got me into reading up on pre-Freudian psychiatry, which is a hugely fascinating area.

25:27.130 --> 25:36.200
And I read a biography of a country doctor called Dr. Langstaff, who actually practiced in Richmond Hill, but after Grace was no longer there.

25:36.780 --> 25:40.484
And it gives his background where he studied.

25:40.505 --> 25:44.008
It happens to be the same medical school that Simon Jordan studied at.

25:44.028 --> 25:44.569
That's great.

25:45.038 --> 25:50.526
Sort of what they did, what they believed about drugs and these things and those things.

25:51.147 --> 25:57.637
And he was, in fact, recording the dreams of his patients because they were thought to be diagnostic.

25:58.198 --> 25:59.179
And he was writing them down.

25:59.199 --> 26:04.507
The reason he makes such a good subject was he kept records of everything.

26:05.248 --> 26:12.379
So the person doing his biography had all this material, what he prescribed for this and that.

26:12.680 --> 26:14.683
What a treasure trove for you, though.

26:14.883 --> 26:15.084
Oh, gosh.

26:15.104 --> 26:15.805
It was wonderful.

26:17.487 --> 26:20.492
Cases in which an abortion was suspected.

26:21.954 --> 26:23.997
Other cases in which an abortion was known.

26:26.801 --> 26:29.945
Doctors who were suspected of not being on the up and up.

26:32.489 --> 26:41.202
You know, people testifying against each other who he sent to the lunatic asylum and what for, under what conditions.

26:41.975 --> 27:04.472
and as dr workman says and he really did say most of our cases are either alcoholism what we would call alcoholism or what he called religious mania so what were these religious manias really well they were probably you know what we would now call schizophrenic or possibly manic

27:05.093 --> 27:06.114
Bipolar Syndrome.

27:06.134 --> 27:07.757
Would you say they were pretty sophisticated?

27:07.917 --> 27:09.159
I mean... No.

27:09.659 --> 27:10.020
They weren't.

27:10.481 --> 27:11.302
No, not at all.

27:11.863 --> 27:13.605
But it's because they didn't know.

27:14.166 --> 27:15.708
They were seekers.

27:18.532 --> 27:23.219
But they did a lot more, I think, than we... They did a lot more than we think.

27:23.419 --> 27:25.141
We think Freud came out of nowhere.

27:25.181 --> 27:25.822
It's not true.

27:25.862 --> 27:28.466
He came out of a whole century.

27:29.027 --> 27:34.054
Yeah, they were deeply interested in these phenomena.

27:35.283 --> 27:42.912
There are six nineteenth-century operas on the subject of somnambulism.

27:42.972 --> 27:45.455
We only know the one.

27:45.895 --> 27:55.747
Yeah, Lady Macbeth and Othelia combine into people like Lucia in the opera.

27:56.368 --> 28:02.775
It's a very Shakespearean thing when Lucia comes in and does her mad scene, and this is the

28:03.548 --> 28:06.571
These are the elements of the mad scene that they love so much.

28:08.453 --> 28:11.215
The nightgown, the hair down, these are important.

28:11.235 --> 28:15.299
Flowers, either they have flowers or they sing about flowers.

28:16.681 --> 28:26.870
And thinking people are somebody other than who they are, et cetera.

28:27.191 --> 28:29.813
So that was very interesting.

28:29.833 --> 28:31.615
Shakespeare, Walter Scott,

28:32.337 --> 28:37.785
and then into the opera and novel and poems of the Victorian age.

28:39.788 --> 28:40.810
Fascinating.

28:40.830 --> 28:42.132
And the painting, of course.

28:42.152 --> 28:44.114
They love painting these figures.

28:44.195 --> 28:45.617
There are so many Ophelias.

28:48.060 --> 28:53.428
I'm sorry.

28:53.448 --> 28:57.835
We have the book, of course, and I quite pointedly don't question about the book.

28:57.855 --> 28:58.536
That's my job.

28:59.477 --> 28:59.998
The book.

29:00.181 --> 29:05.848
I mean, the novel is my job, so that's, you know.

29:05.868 --> 29:07.130
How about some of these?

29:07.190 --> 29:14.298
Do you respond at all to some of the suggestions that this is kind of a companion volume to Amy's tale?

29:14.318 --> 29:15.199
Do you agree with that?

29:15.219 --> 29:22.368
Well, I think what they have in common is central character living under difficult circumstances.

29:24.831 --> 29:25.412
Okay.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.283
But you could almost say that about a lot of the characters.

29:28.323 --> 29:33.249
Well, difficult and closed circumstances that you can't get out.

29:38.355 --> 29:39.937
You could say they have that in common.

29:39.957 --> 29:46.125
You could say concealing headgear or long dresses.

29:46.185 --> 29:46.646
I don't know.

29:49.649 --> 29:53.374
But apart from that, I think that the other thing they have in common is that

29:55.497 --> 30:25.453
that neither the future nor the past are with us now neither of these things are where we are living right now is it reflective of certain themes that here we are back at the big sculpture problem I mean I just I shy away from those questions because if I say anything about it then that becomes the definitive thing and it's what everybody thinks and I think that really constrains debate and limits ways of looking at things

30:26.615 --> 30:28.378
I acknowledge that, and then it gets in print.

30:28.639 --> 30:32.786
Then it gets into print, and then it becomes dogma, and then it becomes silly and ridiculous.

30:32.846 --> 30:40.699
You can just throw out something as an idea that's floated through your head, and everybody thinks it's engraved in stone.

30:40.980 --> 30:51.458
Certainly for these people who haven't read you, number one, and number two, perceive you as being this hard-line woman...

30:52.163 --> 30:55.789
embracing women's issues, whatever, themes.

30:55.809 --> 31:00.275
That's not the case in this particular book.

31:00.295 --> 31:07.687
Well, you know, if you come to think of it, was it ever the case, or was this something made up by some frightened people?

31:07.787 --> 31:09.610
Well, I said we probably haven't read the book.

31:09.630 --> 31:10.010
Yeah.

31:10.030 --> 31:13.896
I mean, hard line is, men are all bad, let's push them off a cliff.

31:14.477 --> 31:18.964
That has never been anything that I have been at all interested in.

31:20.277 --> 31:28.206
And I think in particular in this book, where it is an ambiguous resolution, or there is no resolution at all.

31:28.406 --> 31:29.588
I mean, take your pick.

31:29.888 --> 31:37.176
And whatever you think happened, you quite scrupulously kept to yourself, too, as I imagine you intend to do.

31:38.618 --> 31:42.482
She says, nodding.

31:48.189 --> 31:49.390
I'm told that there...

31:49.825 --> 31:59.296
in a classroom in one of our universities, which I will not name, taking, quote, women's issues.

31:59.977 --> 32:13.352
The class was debating on whether or not I was, quote, a real feminist because the heroine of Cat's Eye gets along well with her brother.

32:16.673 --> 32:19.395
Now, what is their idea of a real feminist?

32:19.415 --> 32:20.897
I mean, it boggles the mind.

32:21.477 --> 32:22.778
I cannot imagine.

32:23.339 --> 32:38.291
There was a book that came out... And others sitting around debating darkly, deciding that I must have a very bad relationship with my mother, or else I would not have written such negative female characters.

32:41.654 --> 32:44.056
There was a book that came out... I get along fine with my mother.

32:44.356 --> 32:45.017
Thank you.

32:45.037 --> 32:46.478
A book that came out last summer...

32:47.099 --> 32:50.804
Push by this woman, Sapphire, you know, the book.

32:51.525 --> 33:00.616
And of course, if you believe what you read, I, as a middle-aged white male, would feel threatened and hate this book.

33:01.417 --> 33:05.422
I read it, I thought it was extraordinary, and I interviewed the woman, you know.

33:05.702 --> 33:11.149
If you read the book, it's about a child who begins to, a young girl who

33:11.973 --> 33:41.912
has this awakening experience with literacy I mean and you know but if you read the clips you're going to perceive yourself as the enemy you know it's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen anyway I think a lot of people have been given a negative spin in this country that they don't deserve over the years maybe not so much now but over the years I think I'm

33:42.078 --> 33:48.045
especially at the beginning, people tended to polarize a lot on issues.

33:49.247 --> 33:58.338
This new book that I'm working on will pay particular attention to these canon wars, the literary canon debates.

33:58.378 --> 33:59.579
That's not going to be the whole book.

33:59.620 --> 34:01.382
It'll just be a concluding chapter.

34:02.964 --> 34:10.633
Libraries of the future, the shape of... I mean, I look at your novel, which is not only beautifully written, but beautifully produced, and you look at...

34:10.934 --> 34:16.262
You look at the poetry and all the other little touches that are there.

34:18.224 --> 34:20.468
Do you have any thoughts on the shape of books?

34:20.588 --> 34:23.051
I mean, we talk about hypertext, for instance.

34:23.151 --> 34:25.194
You mean internet things?

34:25.234 --> 34:31.363
Yeah, well, people can actually conceive of books where maybe there isn't even one author.

34:31.463 --> 34:35.649
Oh, this has been the Bible, you know.

34:35.870 --> 34:36.891
It's a book like that.

34:37.580 --> 34:50.305
Not one author unless we decide that God wrote the whole thing, but we know that it was written over many different time periods and then put together into something we now think as a book.

34:51.407 --> 34:56.297
And this whole concept of hypertext, it's even possible that other people could go in and...

34:57.020 --> 34:58.523
Rearrange your touch.

34:58.543 --> 34:59.885
Rearrange your story.

34:59.905 --> 35:03.111
Well, of course, Mr. Baudler was doing that.

35:03.432 --> 35:06.037
I have that in the notes from this chapter of Thomas Baudler.

35:06.057 --> 35:07.239
This is not a new thing.

35:07.259 --> 35:08.722
Precisely, but he did.

35:08.742 --> 35:10.525
Of course he did for the rest.

35:11.246 --> 35:18.640
And actually, there's this book I have with me called The Future of the Book, and we'll have to do some research after this.

35:19.497 --> 35:23.562
There are any number of instances, especially a playwright who works with a director.

35:24.143 --> 35:31.593
You talk about writing a play, and what actually is presented is very rarely the actual thing.

35:31.653 --> 35:45.692
There are a number of European playwrights who actually solicited the... Well, and you know Shakespeare and all the arguments about the first folio and this version, that version, and which version is it.

35:45.712 --> 35:48.356
He was indifferent to publishing books in his lifetime.

35:48.376 --> 35:48.576
Of course.

35:48.657 --> 35:49.999
They weren't the thing then.

35:50.960 --> 36:04.520
The main event was on the stage, and the only time he may have participated in some of the quartos, because piracy's got them so wrong, and they had to correct it and say, this is ridiculous, let's get it right.

36:05.001 --> 36:11.250
But he had nothing to do with the publication of his own works in the portfolio.

36:11.371 --> 36:11.911
So who's to say?

36:11.951 --> 36:14.395
But I'm wondering, do you have any thoughts on

36:15.016 --> 36:21.422
I don't think, you know, the book with pages and a cover, I don't think that's going away soon at all.

36:22.764 --> 36:24.786
You can't take a computer to bed with you.

36:25.787 --> 36:30.551
And the book, I think it was Bill Gates who said, the book is already fully interactive.

36:31.532 --> 36:37.919
You can turn backwards, you can turn forward, you can do it a heck of a lot faster than you can do it on a screen.

36:37.999 --> 36:42.103
It doesn't give you the same kind of dry eyes and things.

36:42.218 --> 36:44.383
You can do it at your own speed.

36:44.423 --> 36:45.966
You can do it at your own speed.

36:46.026 --> 36:52.400
You can start in the middle and go towards both ends, as I sometimes do.

36:52.420 --> 36:54.745
So I don't think it's going anywhere at all.

36:55.386 --> 37:02.421
There are actually studies over at MIT, and I have to go get them at the Media Lab.

37:03.211 --> 37:06.154
I'm sure it's true.

37:06.635 --> 37:08.577
I'm sure it's true.

37:08.977 --> 37:16.886
And I know that as a writer, I'm sure that you write something one way, and you know it's going to appear differently when it appears in print.

37:16.906 --> 37:24.275
I mean, I know this doing, working for newspapers and writing on a computer screen, when something comes out as a page of manuscript, it's different.

37:24.295 --> 37:29.100
Well, that's why I always correct on the actual printout.

37:29.452 --> 37:33.799
And indeed, I usually begin with a longhand version.

37:35.102 --> 37:46.821
Is the debate in Canada as acrimoniously waged over this canon debate that we have here?

37:46.982 --> 37:48.023
It's waged.

37:48.144 --> 37:50.147
It's waged.

37:50.948 --> 37:54.835
I don't think anything is quite as acrimonious there as it is here.

37:56.047 --> 37:57.950
Well, some things are.

37:58.090 --> 38:00.053
You're not too into the Quebec issue.

38:00.193 --> 38:10.749
They get acrimonious about that.

38:11.630 --> 38:14.014
I don't think there's just one canon anymore.

38:14.034 --> 38:16.097
I think there are many canons

38:17.191 --> 38:19.154
I think that's the answer, by the way.

38:20.095 --> 38:20.336
Yeah.

38:21.037 --> 38:24.562
You know, there wasn't ever just one canon.

38:24.602 --> 38:29.489
There were schools that had canons, but if you went to another school, it would be a different canon.

38:29.609 --> 38:32.313
Of course, the whole concept of canon is fairly recent in any case.

38:32.333 --> 38:36.780
I think it's very—I never heard that word before, probably in the 1980s.

38:36.840 --> 38:38.322
It's really kind of come upon us.

38:38.757 --> 38:42.501
And who reads the classics anymore?

38:42.821 --> 38:44.844
I do, but not all of them.

38:44.924 --> 38:50.370
You know, I read Greek, I read the Greek plays, and I think that this is my daughter's son.

38:50.390 --> 38:55.895
Which is sometimes astonishingly modern in their point of theater.

38:55.915 --> 38:58.018
My younger daughter just read Medea, you know.

38:58.138 --> 38:59.499
Yeah, astonishingly modern.

38:59.579 --> 39:00.300
Amazing.

39:00.320 --> 39:04.765
A lot to be said about that.

39:05.470 --> 39:08.653
Do you feel that at work, Scott Turow told me this story.

39:08.773 --> 39:09.373
I was telling him.

39:10.314 --> 39:21.384
I said, how do you respond when you're told that you can go to Georgetown University and get a degree in English literature without being required to study Shakespeare?

39:21.624 --> 39:23.446
He said, I'll do you one better than that.

39:23.486 --> 39:25.588
He's an alumnus of Amherst College.

39:26.208 --> 39:29.031
He said he was at a dinner, and he said, use it, too.

39:29.111 --> 39:30.132
I mean, I'm going to check it out.

39:30.172 --> 39:32.414
But he was at a dinner with the president of the college.

39:32.434 --> 39:33.975
When the president was informed,

39:34.647 --> 39:59.040
that they had just graduated a summa cum laude in English, and this student had never studied Shakespeare, Milton, Chaucer, or Spencer, and that this person not only got a degree in English, I mean, literature is a different thing, but to call it English literature, and to give him a summa on top of that... Well, what you feel is that the kid has been shortchanged.

40:00.341 --> 40:02.224
The kid has been shortchanged.

40:03.166 --> 40:06.091
How worthwhile is such a degree, I wonder?

40:06.912 --> 40:09.576
Well, that isn't even to me the question.

40:09.617 --> 40:19.232
The question is, this is somebody who has been deprived of something that ought to have been available to him.

40:19.993 --> 40:20.614
It was a him.

40:21.416 --> 40:22.618
It was a him.

40:22.698 --> 40:25.122
I asked him, was it a him, and it was a him.

40:26.604 --> 40:28.988
It would almost even make more sense if it were a woman.

40:29.592 --> 40:33.640
because of this whole concept of dead white European males.

40:33.660 --> 40:36.827
Well, I object to the deadness in that phrase.

40:36.847 --> 40:38.170
We're all going to be dead one day.

40:38.210 --> 40:41.717
Who are these people that think they're never going to be dead?

40:41.737 --> 40:46.707
I did an interview with Harold Bloom for this new book.

40:47.362 --> 40:54.651
And he said, you know, this whole thing, he was talking about Omens and Millennium, his book, and he said, you know, this whole, I'm really bothered by this whole concept of the near-death experience.

40:54.972 --> 40:59.437
All of life is the near-death experience.

40:59.457 --> 40:59.798
That's right.

40:59.838 --> 41:02.001
Well, they knew that in the 17th century.

41:02.702 --> 41:03.202
That's right.

41:03.523 --> 41:05.405
As I am now, you soon will be.

41:06.707 --> 41:09.751
But do you feel that a book has to be relevant?

41:11.032 --> 41:16.339
Relevant is relative, relevant to him.

41:16.943 --> 41:23.189
I just read a book that was intensely relevant to me, but I doubt that it would be very relevant to many of the other people reading it.

41:23.229 --> 41:25.891
What was that book, Out of Curiosity?

41:25.911 --> 41:27.072
Out of Curiosity.

41:27.853 --> 41:36.801
It was a book by a man called Carlo Ginzburg, who was an explorer of little-known folkways.

41:38.202 --> 41:39.503
I love that book.

41:39.663 --> 41:40.564
Well, you might.

41:41.985 --> 41:44.908
I might just look it up at the afternoon right now.

41:45.462 --> 41:48.106
Deciphering the Witch's Sabbath.

41:49.948 --> 41:58.501
And I personally found it intensely riveting, but many would not, partly because it is a very scholarly work.

41:59.742 --> 42:02.446
It's an intensely scholarly work.

42:02.466 --> 42:07.193
And not what we might normally call a literary work, per se, right?

42:07.213 --> 42:15.064
Oh, I would say scholarly rather than literary, and also it's a translation, and I'm sure that in a couple of bits anyway it was...

42:16.023 --> 42:21.492
Not totally well translated, but you better not print that.

42:21.813 --> 42:23.836
That's fine, yeah.

42:23.856 --> 42:25.879
Anything I'm doing now, if you don't mind.

42:26.100 --> 42:42.807
It's a very interesting thing which goes into what the people giving the testimony, when it isn't just dictated by inquisitors and such folk, what they really thought they were doing, what they thought they were doing.

42:44.002 --> 42:48.328
and where that thing that they thought they were doing came from.

42:49.349 --> 42:57.299
And then he gets into, what does Cinderella, Achilles, and Oedipus have in common?

42:59.682 --> 43:02.486
Good question.

43:02.506 --> 43:05.470
He won't like this book.

43:05.973 --> 43:08.556
If that question interests you, you will like this book.

43:08.576 --> 43:09.297
Oh, I just look it up.

43:09.337 --> 43:10.399
Carlo Ginsberg?

43:10.439 --> 43:11.380
Carlo Ginsberg.

43:11.400 --> 43:14.945
It's available in a quality paper box.

43:15.285 --> 43:21.273
How on earth did I come across it?

43:22.755 --> 43:28.122
I bought it in the store quite recently, so books in print will have it.

43:28.242 --> 43:30.045
Or I'll get it up at the Athenaeum.

43:30.205 --> 43:32.588
I'll get about ten books for you.

43:33.310 --> 43:44.989
You know, we have had three prior interviews, so I don't really want to cover ground that we've covered in the past, and I feel free, I keep very careful notes and tapes, so I feel free to draw on that material.

43:45.010 --> 43:52.662
I would love for you to describe a book before we go ahead.

43:54.004 --> 43:54.465
Anyway.

43:55.968 --> 43:56.128
Yes.
