00:02.731 --> 00:05.174
All right, what are the things you try to tell your students?

00:05.194 --> 00:15.627
Yeah, I mean, obviously people have been studying books in America for a long time, so I sort of try to identify different traditions as trans.

00:17.209 --> 00:32.147
And the three that I usually point to is, first of all, the amateur, using amateur both in the sense of non-professional but also in the French sense of people who are doing it out of birth.

00:32.988 --> 00:39.018
I think that's really the tradition that Isaiah Thomas himself comes in.

00:39.038 --> 00:59.552
Many people who themselves were in the book trades or book collectors or librarians gathered together and did a lot of scholarly work in the history of the book, although it tends to be very scattered and, you know, the quality can vary a lot.

00:59.802 --> 01:26.906
The second tradition in America has been the bibliographical one, which, since World War II, has been heavily influenced by Fredson Bowers and his school bibliography, school in the sense of discipline, and was something that was based in the academy to a large degree and largely in the English department.

01:26.926 --> 01:27.767
And...

01:28.422 --> 01:30.946
also something that really accomplished a great deal.

01:31.968 --> 01:36.154
The third is what people now sort of refer to as history of the book.

01:38.017 --> 01:48.715
And this is a translation of the French term, and it has people think about history of the book.

01:48.735 --> 01:55.105
It certainly was very heavily influenced by French theorists and scholars.

01:55.726 --> 02:00.173
most notably Henri-Jean Martin and then Roger Chartier.

02:02.517 --> 02:11.250
And it really, as they conceived the history of the book, they saw it as a kind of cultural history.

02:11.271 --> 02:20.485
And looking at the ways in which books both act on and act in society,

02:22.507 --> 02:25.530
I'm sorry, act in and act on society.

02:26.511 --> 02:28.833
Okay.

02:29.153 --> 02:30.895
That's quite a novel concept, isn't it?

02:31.275 --> 02:33.417
Act on books, acting on society?

02:33.778 --> 02:35.279
Well, it is and it isn't.

02:35.519 --> 02:42.426
I mean, people sort of long believed that you can blame certain books for things.

02:43.927 --> 02:49.172
I mean, the big question that in some ways is at the heart of a lot of the French work is,

02:49.473 --> 02:54.722
you know, is it true that Voltaire and Rousseau caused the French Revolution with their writings?

02:56.845 --> 03:00.551
And then the question becomes, if they did, how did that work?

03:00.992 --> 03:02.174
Or if it didn't, why not?

03:03.116 --> 03:14.214
Why is it that people often believe, you know, or, you know, that the anti-war protests were the result of the Rolling Stones?

03:14.234 --> 03:14.755
You know, I mean,

03:15.173 --> 03:24.124
That kind of sense that cultural products have social impacts is one that people sort of have a gut belief in.

03:24.604 --> 03:42.606
But with modern, this modern disciplinary approach, a way to attempt to prove that, I guess, is to not only study the writings, but study how many copies were printed, who sold them, try and find out who read them, that kind of stuff, right?

03:42.626 --> 03:42.847
Exactly.

03:43.107 --> 03:43.948
I mean, look...

03:43.928 --> 04:01.130
not look at the book as a kind of isolated product that just exists there, but see, try to use it as a way of getting into the various worlds in which created it, in which it was produced, and in which it circulated.

04:03.213 --> 04:07.438
And in some ways, the history of the book

04:08.077 --> 04:20.937
I like to think of it as having, you know, multiple disciplines because people can do history of the book and end up doing labor history, the lives of people who make books.

04:20.957 --> 04:33.477
Or they can end up, you know, doing design history and the ways in which design features, fashions, and design changes over time.

04:34.992 --> 04:36.154
I'm sorry.

04:36.174 --> 04:37.956
Or whatever, yeah.

04:37.976 --> 04:41.260
But you more or less came to this as a bibliographer, right?

04:42.081 --> 04:43.904
How would you say you came to this?

04:43.944 --> 04:54.137
Well, I was working at the Harvard Library on a bibliographical project.

04:54.438 --> 04:54.938
Which was?

04:55.279 --> 04:57.321
Which was Bibliography of American Literature.

04:57.341 --> 05:00.105
Oh, of course.

05:01.958 --> 05:06.846
Which is something, by the way, I want to talk to you about later, you know, for this.

05:06.946 --> 05:14.658
Anyway, well, sort of one of the, I mean, I guess I always, one way of describing it is just institutionally what happened.

05:14.678 --> 05:25.215
One of the big events for the history of the book in America was a 19, I think it was 80,

05:26.444 --> 05:29.008
a Rare Books and Manuscript pre-conference.

05:29.208 --> 05:32.674
I think I have the book right here, which is Books in Society and History.

05:33.996 --> 05:36.099
And that was organized by Ken Carpenter.

05:37.461 --> 05:42.529
And Ken used to frequently eat lunch.

05:42.549 --> 05:48.037
My office at the Southern Library was sort of a lunchroom of people.

05:48.057 --> 05:50.821
And we had a number of people who would come and eat lunch there.

05:51.422 --> 05:52.244
That was your office?

05:52.584 --> 05:53.886
That was my office, yeah.

05:54.997 --> 05:58.001
And so a lot of things got traded around.

05:58.061 --> 06:05.050
And one of the things that happened was Ken started talking about organizing this conference.

06:05.070 --> 06:13.902
And so that was one of the times in which I sort of got involved with it.

06:13.922 --> 06:22.253
And that conference was actually very important, not just for the... I mean, it was important in America because it brought a lot of foreign scholars over...

06:22.975 --> 06:27.061
and people heard and met some of this last time.

06:27.081 --> 06:31.527
Well, I also noted here that it's almost like a clarion call for scholars to do this.

06:32.128 --> 06:34.791
Yeah, well, there is that statement, isn't there?

06:34.811 --> 06:36.133
Yeah, there is, yeah.

06:36.153 --> 06:41.400
Yeah, I think everyone's a little embarrassed after this.

06:41.420 --> 06:45.726
But also, it turned out that many of those Europeans hadn't yet met each other.

06:45.826 --> 06:50.012
I mean, I think that there's been a lot of work going on that people...

06:50.768 --> 06:52.830
hadn't kind of put together before.

06:53.751 --> 07:06.364
And so in many ways, I think that conference was a moment in which the idea that there might actually be something emerging, like a discipline, came out.

07:08.266 --> 07:10.528
And it certainly reached out, I think, to a lot.

07:11.309 --> 07:19.577
It was also sort of a public thing that it caught the attention of more people than just some of the scholars who've been working

07:21.599 --> 07:29.392
So, and then if you could, and of course, Robert Darnton's books, which I happen to have four of them, they're remarkable.

07:30.994 --> 07:38.166
He is really one of the leading, I guess, practitioners of this discipline, right?

07:38.186 --> 07:48.923
Well, he certainly is kind of, I mean, both as a pioneering scholar and also as a very articulate scholar.

07:50.472 --> 07:54.997
and a clear-headed scholar.

07:55.017 --> 07:55.837
He's certainly one of the leading people.

07:55.857 --> 07:58.260
It helps also that he writes excessively.

07:58.280 --> 07:58.900
Yeah, exactly.

08:01.063 --> 08:10.612
People really, I think he writes, and I've just recently read some essays, a brand new book from Princeton, you know, What's Happened to the Humanities.

08:10.632 --> 08:11.613
I don't know if you're familiar with that.

08:11.633 --> 08:13.815
It was just reviewed in the New York Times last week.

08:13.875 --> 08:15.157
Oh, yeah, I did see that review.

08:15.177 --> 08:18.640
So I called immediately and got a review copy, you know.

08:18.620 --> 08:26.143
And, you know, some of this stuff is fascinating, but you can see why it's not going to... It probably will never sell more than 2,000 copies, you know.

08:28.751 --> 08:30.115
There's almost this...

08:30.398 --> 08:36.408
how do I put this, but you find people not really wanting to talk to a general readership.

08:37.270 --> 08:50.812
But I find with Darnton's writing, with your writing, with David Hall's writing, there is this accessibility that is really very exciting to me, I guess.

08:51.253 --> 08:56.001
Well, I mean, Darnton is a master, and I always say he's a master of the case study.

08:57.179 --> 09:06.370
he finds that incident which he is able then to use to tease out.

09:06.570 --> 09:14.039
But I would also, I mean, there's lots of bad, not bad, but sort of politics in it.

09:14.059 --> 09:18.765
I would also say that Betty Eisenstein was very, very influential early on.

09:19.589 --> 09:20.690
I have to get her books.

09:21.812 --> 09:27.740
This is about, you're maybe about the ninth or tenth person to name her, you know?

09:28.140 --> 09:37.312
I mean, what she did, I mean, I don't, I wasn't involved in the academic world enough to understand it, so I don't know.

09:38.414 --> 09:40.937
But I don't think she's gotten the credit that she deserves.

09:40.997 --> 09:46.845
Because what she did in her big book, The Printing Practice, Agent of Change,

09:47.315 --> 09:53.204
was kind of produce a very solid historical monograph that no one could go up against.

09:54.887 --> 10:03.300
And yes, there were mistakes in it, and people wouldn't, I think, agree with all of her interpretations today.

10:03.320 --> 10:10.892
But I think the fact that she published it then really sort of added weight to the field.

10:11.750 --> 10:13.712
It's kind of the opposite of Bob's work.

10:14.213 --> 10:19.920
Bob's work tends to be essays, as you say, tends to be very accessible.

10:20.120 --> 10:28.351
What would you say was singularly significant about that particular work of hers?

10:28.631 --> 10:34.578
Well, just the erudition and amount of scholarship she puts into it.

10:34.599 --> 10:40.626
And I think a real attempt to sustain a serious argument.

10:44.065 --> 10:50.174
Where is she, by the way, do you know?

10:50.194 --> 10:50.794
She's retired.

10:50.814 --> 10:51.836
She lives in D.C.

10:52.216 --> 10:53.017
She lives in D.C.?

10:53.638 --> 10:55.621
Maybe she's somebody I ought to talk to at some point.

10:56.282 --> 10:56.783
I like her.

10:56.863 --> 11:04.073
Somewhere or another, I have her email address.

11:04.093 --> 11:05.595
Let me see if it's here on my computer.

11:07.618 --> 11:10.762
Anyway.

11:10.782 --> 11:12.064
What's your email address?

11:13.158 --> 11:13.739
If you don't mind.

11:13.759 --> 11:19.086
I guess I don't have it here.

11:19.306 --> 11:24.112
My email address is bal at... I like that, bal.

11:24.132 --> 11:32.082
Well, that was in the old days when you could actually keep your email secret.

11:32.343 --> 11:36.227
At ccwf... C-C-W-F?

11:36.368 --> 11:38.490
Yeah, computation work facility.

11:38.510 --> 11:38.791
Okay.

11:39.251 --> 11:42.135
Dot computation center, cc...

11:42.790 --> 11:43.971
Just CC.

11:44.151 --> 11:46.053
Just CC, I'm sorry.

11:46.093 --> 11:50.517
.utexas.edu.

11:50.537 --> 11:52.459
Good.

11:53.280 --> 11:53.700
Okay.

11:54.261 --> 12:00.266
She said she made a real attempt to sustain a serious argument, I guess.

12:00.286 --> 12:08.093
You know, Bob tends to write pieces that are about specific incidents or specific people.

12:09.835 --> 12:11.937
And her book is really trying to...

12:12.541 --> 12:18.691
make an argument about Western civilization, if you see the sort of difference in scope.

12:21.376 --> 12:25.042
And obviously one of those is a much harder thing to sustain.

12:25.282 --> 12:25.503
Yeah.

12:26.083 --> 12:27.706
Her book must still be in print, right?

12:29.309 --> 12:32.134
I'm sure it must be.

12:32.154 --> 12:33.616
I'm sure I can get one at Waterstones.

12:33.896 --> 12:37.022
Yeah.

12:37.563 --> 12:38.144
Anyway.

12:38.164 --> 12:38.464
Yeah.

12:39.187 --> 12:46.787
There's a shorter version that she later produced, and that I'm sure is impressed.

12:46.808 --> 12:48.953
I'm thinking for the bibliography of this thing, too.

12:49.154 --> 12:55.170
I really want to make a very comprehensive bibliography, if I can.

12:55.319 --> 13:00.744
Anyway, I'm sorry, we got off sidetrack there, but fascinating stuff.

13:00.784 --> 13:17.861
So in terms of the American experience now, if we could sharpen the focus a little bit to what's going on here, here being the U.S., and how these seminars work into that and these various subjects.

13:18.602 --> 13:22.626
Well, I think that, I mean, obviously the first...

13:24.547 --> 13:38.421
Well, to a certain degree, the main people who started out doing history of the book were people who were historians of Europe, American historians, like Darden, a historian of France.

13:40.283 --> 13:53.136
And in a sense, I mean, the key figure, of course, for American historians of America is David Hall.

13:54.668 --> 14:15.761
And the AAF had, for a long time, of course, been doing, supporting its collections and its programs, you know, book history, in other sense, both bibliography and other kinds of history.

14:15.781 --> 14:22.752
And they had a number of conferences you've probably seen or have during those conferences.

14:24.098 --> 14:30.910
even one of which I think came before the Boston one, and which are not really part of the program.

14:32.693 --> 14:44.815
But at some point, David, and I don't know, I don't know exactly how, suggested that they ought to actually form an official program.

14:46.899 --> 14:48.081
And, you know, that,

14:48.736 --> 15:01.494
in some sense wasn't necessary, but provided a letterhead and an excuse for the little newsletter they sent and certainly a way for raising money.

15:01.794 --> 15:01.994
Yeah.

15:03.076 --> 15:08.103
Probably was one of the more, you know, actually one of the more important advantages.

15:09.845 --> 15:16.414
And the initial thing, of course, was that NEH launched the Needs and Opportunities Conference.

15:18.453 --> 15:26.429
That came with 83, I think.

15:28.393 --> 15:30.337
I'm typing here, Chad.

15:31.780 --> 15:33.845
Typing and taping.

15:35.007 --> 15:36.951
Excuse me.

15:37.741 --> 15:49.981
How would you describe, would you call it still a discipline that's in its infancy, or do you think it's, where is it in terms of its maturity, and how would you judge some of the early work?

16:01.459 --> 16:04.744
Personally, I tend to think it probably isn't a discipline.

16:04.859 --> 16:07.041
Okay.

16:07.061 --> 16:16.089
I mean, actually, and I think that the attempt to try and make it into one is not very interesting.

16:16.110 --> 16:33.686
I think it's a group of people who have sort of a shared insight and interest, but that it's probably best characterized by diversity.

16:33.706 --> 16:33.786
Hmm.

16:36.432 --> 16:38.994
But I know that many people would disagree with that.

16:44.819 --> 16:51.385
But it certainly is a different, if not a new way, but an expanded way of looking at things, isn't it?

16:52.386 --> 17:05.477
And the fact that it is interdisciplinary, I mean, the formality of the rules have been relaxed considerably, haven't they, in terms of how you go about figuring out what happened?

17:05.947 --> 17:10.554
Well, I mean, I don't know what that means.

17:11.856 --> 17:14.800
I mean, I think that there has been some pretty amateurish work.

17:19.507 --> 17:21.450
Which is always going to happen in the beginning of anything.

17:21.470 --> 17:22.572
Which is always going to happen.

17:24.074 --> 17:30.143
And I don't know.

17:32.967 --> 17:35.751
Well, the thing that's amazing to me...

17:36.693 --> 17:43.642
and I must say I was completely wrong, was the whole founding and emergence of SHARP.

17:47.187 --> 18:02.086
And I, well, I remember very early on saying to Jonathan and Simon that really, did SHARP really need to exist?

18:02.106 --> 18:05.991
My sense being that there were organizations already in place.

18:06.140 --> 18:10.224
that could serve the same function.

18:11.025 --> 18:24.598
And partly, I suppose, my misreading of it, and partly I think that those societies didn't take up the challenge.

18:27.521 --> 18:32.586
But I had no idea that Sharpe was sort of virgin the way it was, and that there were so many

18:36.228 --> 18:42.038
around the country that we're interested in.

18:42.058 --> 18:45.143
I just heard about Sharp just within the last couple of months.

18:45.243 --> 18:46.465
I mean, I'm slow coming to it.

18:47.486 --> 18:50.071
But, you know, David Stamm at Syracuse?

18:50.191 --> 18:51.233
Yeah.

18:51.253 --> 18:59.727
He, you know, emailed me, like, out of nowhere, you know, and just liked my book and suggested something, and he was coming to Harvard for a weekend.

18:59.907 --> 19:01.830
Let's get together for lunch, you know.

19:02.232 --> 19:06.077
And that's how I found out about Sharp.

19:06.297 --> 19:09.941
And all of a sudden, it is a pretty interesting tangent, doesn't it?

19:10.021 --> 19:14.066
I mean, it's whether interesting or that's a subjective thing.

19:14.086 --> 19:20.133
But I wondered, you know, how did Sharp emerge, you know, from this?

19:20.513 --> 19:21.234
And I agree with you.

19:21.254 --> 19:26.080
Why was it necessary for this specific group to... Well, I think it had...

19:30.312 --> 19:34.500
Maybe it's a good excuse to travel to nice places and have conferences.

19:34.921 --> 19:36.143
Well, that's crazy.

19:36.164 --> 19:40.532
There's so many things about sharps that annoy me, but I've got to be very careful.

19:40.773 --> 19:41.754
Yeah, don't worry.

19:41.795 --> 19:45.081
I'm not going to embarrass you.

19:45.550 --> 19:50.377
As you get to know me, you'll find out I really don't want to embarrass anybody.

19:51.419 --> 19:52.080
What can I say?

19:52.100 --> 19:54.384
I mean, it has to do with the geography.

19:54.404 --> 19:55.686
Yeah, and I'm not quoting you on this.

19:55.726 --> 19:57.729
Sharpe is not a focus of interest here.

19:57.909 --> 20:00.073
It has to do with the geography of the U.S.

20:00.934 --> 20:04.960
Actually, it has to do with two things, I think.

20:04.980 --> 20:07.544
Well, the English side is different.

20:07.724 --> 20:12.672
The English side really, I think, has to do with...

20:14.710 --> 20:22.862
a sense that the bibliographical society and that kind of circle of people is an old boy network.

20:25.386 --> 20:31.536
And that there were people sort of feeling that they needed some other kind of forum.

20:31.556 --> 20:34.821
But in the States, I think it just had to do with geography.

20:35.662 --> 20:42.372
That you have all these people in all of these universities and libraries all over the country who are feeling alone.

20:43.010 --> 20:47.299
I'm the only person here that's interested in it.

20:48.361 --> 20:54.975
And if the net hadn't emerged at the same time, I don't know that Sharp would have had the same impact.

20:55.917 --> 20:57.800
That's interesting, isn't it?

20:58.201 --> 21:03.432
It would have, to a certain extent, because its meetings and so on provided just a newsletter.

21:05.386 --> 21:13.316
But email does really... The email and the listserv and the web page.

21:13.336 --> 21:17.382
Just look at that Ex Libris page, the stuff that's on there now.

21:17.782 --> 21:20.966
I have never subscribed to it.

21:20.986 --> 21:26.593
I don't subscribe to it, but I do punch in every once in a while just to pick up things about what's going on.

21:27.374 --> 21:28.496
And you can't keep up with it.

21:28.556 --> 21:31.680
Now there are 20, 30 things coming on each day.

21:31.660 --> 21:34.644
90% of it is pure nonsense, you know?

21:34.704 --> 21:35.225
Exactly.

21:35.265 --> 21:39.311
And I don't have the time to wade through that every day, you know?

21:40.012 --> 21:42.655
And then once you get hopelessly behind, you're hopelessly behind.

21:42.695 --> 21:44.518
And that's the end of that.

21:44.898 --> 21:47.302
The concept was nice.

21:47.322 --> 21:51.207
You know, I think that Sharp, and, you know, Sharp does that with its conferences, too.

21:52.509 --> 22:01.161
You know, his conferences are completely sort of baggy and, you know, too many papers and so on.

22:01.698 --> 22:06.647
Everybody almost gets to read their paper.

22:08.410 --> 22:15.261
I once suggested that they actually we could just have an hour where everybody read their paper and then we could get on with the rest of the meeting.

22:15.562 --> 22:15.662
Yeah.

22:16.724 --> 22:21.432
Well, in fact, David actually suggested I go to this meeting in Cambridge.

22:21.873 --> 22:26.541
And I said, gee, maybe I just had to get copies of the papers and I've got everything I need, you know.

22:26.926 --> 22:29.089
I did not go.

22:29.129 --> 22:30.251
I was in Paris instead.

22:30.331 --> 22:31.713
No, I was at it.

22:31.953 --> 22:32.374
Did you go?

22:32.594 --> 22:33.656
Yeah.

22:33.936 --> 22:34.277
Did you?

22:34.517 --> 22:34.777
Yeah.

22:35.378 --> 22:35.779
On what?

22:36.199 --> 22:36.880
On Uncle Tom.

22:37.581 --> 22:37.662
Ah.

22:39.084 --> 22:40.626
Now, will they publish these?

22:41.287 --> 22:42.829
Do you publish these on your own?

22:42.989 --> 22:43.951
Well, that's another thing.

22:43.991 --> 22:56.629
Sharp now wants to have an annual, or is going to have an annual, I shouldn't even say wants to, which means that the other thing, of course, Sharp was very cheap.

22:57.149 --> 23:05.729
And now, of course, you basically, in order to support publishing a volume every year, you're going to have to raise up the dues and so on.

23:06.952 --> 23:09.718
I think it's gone up to $35 a year or something.

23:09.738 --> 23:11.442
Well, that's not too bad.

23:13.387 --> 23:15.933
If the volume is pretty interesting, it's worth it.

23:15.953 --> 23:16.153
Yeah.

23:16.724 --> 23:21.514
I mean, to me, the best 50 bucks in the world is the Friends of the Harvard College Library.

23:22.396 --> 23:27.727
I mean, the stuff that you get is just absolutely wonderful and unbelievable.

23:27.747 --> 23:30.533
I mean, that's just a comment.

23:33.219 --> 23:34.902
What else can I ask you for the...

23:35.573 --> 23:58.088
A thrust of this new book, and it's awfully hard to explain, but it's this whole concept of book culture, you know, as we approach the, and I don't want to get into a hackneyed discussion of the new millennium and all that, but it certainly is coming at a time, isn't it, with all this digital stuff, and I've really been looking with great interest in going to Cornell, where they are.

23:58.372 --> 24:10.314
actively involved in digitizing stuff and they are going to reduce by the year 2000 their holdings of 6.8 million books on campus to 5 million books.

24:10.915 --> 24:15.263
You know, what's going to happen to those 2 million books and all this other stuff.

24:15.283 --> 24:17.207
And then on the other hand, we have

24:17.558 --> 24:25.386
this whole new discipline of history of the book with all the areas that you just touched on, what's going to happen to that?

24:25.767 --> 24:31.973
Do you have, I mean, that's a pretty general question, and it's not for this Biblio piece, but it's something to think about.

24:31.993 --> 24:45.507
Well, you know, I mean, I read that stuff, and I mean, okay, I mean, first of all, there's no question at all that with the electronic,

24:46.330 --> 24:48.152
revolution or whatever you want to call it.

24:48.172 --> 24:54.638
And one of the things I always note is, you know, which revolution is it compared to?

24:54.658 --> 25:00.003
And people, you know, there's a whole range of the revolution in the printing press.

25:00.283 --> 25:04.087
Photography.

25:04.107 --> 25:04.407
Sure.

25:04.467 --> 25:13.436
With this revolution, I mean, with this change, people's consciousness of what do I want to say?

25:13.936 --> 25:14.937
The written word

25:16.182 --> 25:44.367
is much higher people don't just sort of take it for granted at all anymore and i mean just practical ways i mean because of what people have to learn to run their computers people are much more knowledgeable about type type size and type styles so i think that certainly yes there must be a connection

25:45.207 --> 25:59.907
between the fact that the media that we are using in our day-to-day lives is changing in our sort of interest in how media works in general.

25:59.927 --> 26:03.953
I think, you know, I'm sure that's fueling it.

26:05.515 --> 26:12.244
I mean, you know, as for the end of the book, I'm not worried about that.

26:12.344 --> 26:14.387
I always like to think, you know, what if he took...

26:14.705 --> 26:22.936
town like Austin or Worcester and decided that books were actually an evil thing and you actually had to get rid of them all.

26:22.956 --> 26:36.854
I can't imagine any society that was organized enough to actually get, you know, if you think how far into your lives books have gotten in all the different ways, if you actually tried to get rid of them all, how difficult that would be.

26:40.319 --> 26:42.682
Well, you're talking about get rid of them all as objects?

26:43.002 --> 26:43.463
Yeah.

26:45.856 --> 26:48.460
But I wonder if you even need a policy to do that.

26:48.820 --> 26:59.775
You find it in a very informal and not organized manner, but you're finding that libraries are deaccessioning books.

27:00.857 --> 27:06.785
They always have, but they're finding excuses now if they're brittle and they're too expensive to preserve.

27:07.566 --> 27:12.032
And you are finding, and I think that with OCLC and other databases like that,

27:12.468 --> 27:19.214
You're finding that a lot of places are getting rid of the same books, and that, you know... Oh, well, that's a different issue, and that's true.

27:19.234 --> 27:23.979
And the problem is, it's not that we're going to not have any books.

27:24.239 --> 27:27.142
The question is, are we going to have the books that we want to have?

27:28.443 --> 27:28.763
Yeah.

27:28.783 --> 27:30.505
That's right.

27:30.525 --> 27:31.766
We're going to have plenty of books.

27:32.326 --> 27:33.588
We're going to have plenty of books.

27:33.808 --> 27:40.534
People who are sort of talking, you know... And I don't... Actually, I don't think I buy...

27:41.324 --> 27:43.307
What's his name, the Gutenberg allergies?

27:43.327 --> 27:46.031
No, Sven Burkitts.

27:46.071 --> 27:47.153
Burkitts stuff either.

27:47.213 --> 27:49.096
Though it is amazing.

27:49.176 --> 27:52.881
I mean, people do behave differently on a computer.

27:53.202 --> 27:54.043
I'm looking at it.

27:55.225 --> 28:08.445
I'm looking at that, but I like to write with examples, which is why I've gone up to Cornell and I've gone up to the Harvard Depository, where they are...

28:08.932 --> 28:10.195
They're building these things.

28:10.255 --> 28:13.281
Two and a half million books you can get into each one of these modules.

28:13.341 --> 28:16.408
At some point you'll have room for 20 million books out there.

28:17.149 --> 28:18.031
They're saving them.

28:18.873 --> 28:22.921
And as much as they can preserve them, they're preserving them.

28:23.883 --> 28:29.134
But Cornell, on the other hand, is on a different track.

28:29.114 --> 28:34.118
And then, of course, they put in figures like at the University of Michigan.

28:34.379 --> 28:35.820
They have a factor.

28:35.880 --> 28:42.186
If a book hasn't been used or called out in five years, that book is in danger.

28:45.188 --> 28:50.413
They're actually applying, you know, when is the last time a book was used?

28:51.254 --> 28:52.235
I know.

28:52.895 --> 28:55.978
I'm seeing our library here die.

28:55.998 --> 28:56.138
Really?

28:56.739 --> 28:57.079
Really?

28:58.156 --> 29:02.461
I mean, do you want to say that again?

29:02.481 --> 29:04.724
Seeing this library here in Texas die.

29:05.324 --> 29:07.587
How do you mean that?

29:08.849 --> 29:11.512
I could go on at great length about this.

29:12.172 --> 29:23.826
And I actually think, on thinking about it, I think it has to do with OCLC.

29:24.835 --> 29:30.702
and pushing people towards using Library of Congress classifications.

29:30.982 --> 29:33.365
What that did was it split people's collections.

29:34.846 --> 29:37.069
Because our general collection used to be a Dewey.

29:38.651 --> 29:44.017
And as soon as they, because of the new cataloging stuff, went to L.C., they couldn't shelve them together.

29:45.638 --> 29:54.268
And what happened then is that people no longer had the feeling that when they bought a book that they were adding it to a pre-existing collection, taking its place.

29:55.177 --> 30:17.995
in something that was bigger than the individual book uh-huh and so the the first thing happened is the lc collections just basically became as you say kind of turnover collections and then the dewey collections looked very strange old out of date and started being shipped out

30:19.730 --> 30:21.592
And what do you mean by shipped out?

30:22.053 --> 30:24.595
Is that a euphemism for a landfill?

30:24.635 --> 30:27.098
It can mean almost anything.

30:28.259 --> 30:30.281
We have a depository like Harvard's.

30:30.442 --> 30:33.565
Not like Harvard's, but somewhat like Harvard's.

30:34.686 --> 30:44.437
And a lot of stuff goes there, but basically that's just its first step towards the landfill because it becomes harder and harder to get access to it.

30:45.258 --> 30:47.560
Both the cataloging and the

30:48.957 --> 30:51.722
and it's no longer part of a whole collection.

30:52.203 --> 30:56.030
Have you ever heard of a phrase, phased deterioration?

30:57.092 --> 30:57.352
No.

30:57.753 --> 31:04.806
That's an institutionalized phrase that I picked up at Cornell, and that's basically a determination

31:05.258 --> 31:17.258
made of a book that they decide is brittle, is going to get more brittle, and then, of course, you reach a point of no return where you can't intervene and save it.

31:17.318 --> 31:25.292
So that's basically the posture they're adopting at Cornell is that, you know, we'll keep it comfortable, but we'll do nothing heroic to keep it alive.

31:25.981 --> 31:31.909
That makes sense to me for a lot of books.

31:32.209 --> 31:41.041
I'm a firm believer in benign neglect as a great conservation technique.

31:44.586 --> 31:46.909
Keeping it in good climate is important.

31:48.593 --> 31:50.195
Very important.

31:50.896 --> 31:53.780
But the next best thing to do is to just not do much with it.

31:53.800 --> 31:56.164
Well, that's exactly what this phase deterioration is.

31:56.925 --> 31:58.988
That's precisely, well, almost the definition of it.

31:59.749 --> 32:01.752
The next best thing is, how did you say that again?

32:02.212 --> 32:04.095
Do very little, do nothing with it.

32:04.115 --> 32:05.858
Never touch it.

32:05.878 --> 32:08.982
But somebody's certainly making a judgment on the content, right?

32:10.278 --> 32:12.160
The next best thing is to do very little with it.

32:12.180 --> 32:18.266
We're assuming that this is a book that somebody's made a judgment has very little intellectual value, right?

32:18.286 --> 32:21.189
Well, I don't know what people are doing.

32:21.470 --> 32:22.651
You can look at it many ways.

32:24.292 --> 32:30.699
One way to look at it is that the real triumph is when a librarian buys a book that nobody's going to want for 30 years.

32:32.381 --> 32:36.505
Because it's easy to know which books people will want tomorrow.

32:36.957 --> 32:39.584
Do you want to hear how the prologue to my new book starts?

32:40.225 --> 32:40.566
Sure.

32:40.707 --> 32:49.870
It takes a minute, but when I was working feverishly on the proofs of Gentle Madness and I had to get them down to New York,

32:50.913 --> 33:00.389
And I desperately needed to find a copy of the 1911 catalog to Samuel Pepys' library because it had the codicil to the will and they needed it.

33:00.530 --> 33:04.216
And I was working off a Xerox from Modlin College, et cetera.

33:05.057 --> 33:07.902
Harvard didn't have it or didn't have it on Hollis.

33:08.623 --> 33:09.665
BPL doesn't have it.

33:09.685 --> 33:13.612
I find it at the Boston Athenaeum, to make a long story short.

33:13.632 --> 33:14.794
And as I'm checking it out,

33:15.365 --> 33:16.767
Of course, they're still on the cards.

33:16.908 --> 33:20.714
I'm the first person in 85 years to take out these books.

33:21.535 --> 33:22.177
First time ever.

33:22.978 --> 33:26.864
And so I make this really dumb statement, gee, 85 years.

33:27.826 --> 33:30.170
Who did they buy these books for in the first place?

33:30.270 --> 33:33.876
The gentleman whose name I have said, why, sir, we bought them for you.

33:35.339 --> 33:39.546
And that'll be basically the prologue to my new book.

33:39.566 --> 33:40.748
We bought them for you, sir.

33:41.403 --> 33:44.526
And as you just, I mean, I got goose pimples when you said that.

33:44.666 --> 33:48.611
If you could say it again, the real triumph for a librarian is to do what?

33:48.691 --> 33:49.772
What did I say?

33:49.792 --> 33:52.235
Well, it's on tape, but it was a wonderful comment.

33:53.156 --> 33:59.823
You know, and I really think that, and you see, that's what I see from those Dewey Stacks.

34:00.063 --> 34:10.414
I mean, they were building up their American poetry title by title, not just the new books as they came out, but filling in, you know, by reading them.

34:10.900 --> 34:13.906
use bookstore catalogs and stuff.

34:13.926 --> 34:17.794
The kind of way of thinking about their collection is just gone.

34:19.478 --> 34:27.053
Well, but you do have librarians now who are using as a justification to

34:27.556 --> 34:33.927
A word they're using at Harvard these days is groom, by the way, as opposed to weed.

34:34.007 --> 34:36.992
I'm making a glossary of these phrases as I go by.

34:37.193 --> 34:37.794
They're grooming.

34:38.194 --> 34:40.619
They believe in grooming at Harvard.

34:41.119 --> 34:42.021
And that's good.

34:42.507 --> 34:49.355
But at Michigan in particular, I mean, if there's a five-year rule there, you know, and that's kind of scary, isn't it?

34:50.176 --> 34:50.937
Yeah, it is for me.

34:52.158 --> 34:54.901
Five years, my God, you know, I mean, you've got eight million books.

34:54.941 --> 34:59.526
How can anybody possibly use every book that's in the library in a five-year period?

35:01.749 --> 35:02.650
But at least it's cheap.

35:03.191 --> 35:04.472
At least it's cheap, that's right.

35:04.492 --> 35:05.393
You don't have to think.

35:05.677 --> 35:12.645
Yeah, but to go back to that statement to which you said, I'm seeing this library die.

35:13.225 --> 35:14.066
What do you mean by that?

35:14.667 --> 35:17.650
I mean, I know you went off... Well, I guess I... Well, I love the quote.

35:17.670 --> 35:20.453
Don't take it back, please.

35:20.473 --> 35:24.037
Don't do that.

35:24.097 --> 35:29.764
No, I just... And I don't think it's unique here.

35:29.784 --> 35:35.650
It's just that one saw a vision for what the library did in the university.

35:37.030 --> 35:38.011
lost.

35:40.294 --> 35:44.921
And the library is, I mean, maybe doing another thing.

35:46.443 --> 35:50.168
And I, you know, I think our library is doing some very good things.

35:50.188 --> 35:52.251
You're not alone, as you point out, by the way, sir.

35:52.271 --> 35:52.651
Oh, I know.

35:53.653 --> 36:05.569
But that particular vision of, you know, really building a collection of books to support the curriculum and scholarship,

36:07.338 --> 36:08.700
It's just not there.

36:09.181 --> 36:21.137
And on the one hand, the new books that they're getting in are, you know, are inadequate.

36:21.157 --> 36:27.946
And, of course, one of the things that happens is if you don't buy it when it's new, you almost, most of the time, you'll never get it.

36:28.146 --> 36:28.607
That's right.

36:29.328 --> 36:30.630
And that's certainly true with journals.

36:32.132 --> 36:32.272
Mm-hmm.

36:32.292 --> 36:35.216
Well, so many journals now are being published online.

36:35.517 --> 36:35.877
Yeah.

36:36.245 --> 36:38.270
So many aren't, though.

36:38.290 --> 36:39.192
So many aren't.

36:40.556 --> 36:48.195
And I do see some merit in the observation that you do a very specialized monograph.

36:48.935 --> 36:52.780
that costs about $150 to buy.

36:52.820 --> 36:56.125
It's published in an edition of 1,000 copies.

36:56.986 --> 37:00.911
It's possibly going to be obsolete the day it appears in print.

37:01.572 --> 37:04.436
Something like that almost should be online, you'd think.

37:04.937 --> 37:06.780
That's fine by me.

37:06.840 --> 37:08.322
I think people publish too much.

37:09.423 --> 37:16.613
I once had this scheme that when you passed your doctoral exam, you would get a little coupon book.

37:16.846 --> 37:22.252
and it would limit you to, say, a dozen articles and some books.

37:22.272 --> 37:22.712
I love that.

37:23.133 --> 37:27.637
And you would have to decide, okay, I want to use up one of my three books on this one.

37:27.898 --> 37:29.479
It's like your frequent flyer miles.

37:30.160 --> 37:33.864
And, of course, you could have an underground trade in them.

37:33.884 --> 37:36.527
I mean, you know, there could be a market for them, too.

37:36.887 --> 37:42.874
Someone who wasn't producing books could sell his to someone who wanted to produce four books and so on.

37:42.894 --> 37:46.077
But I just think, I mean, I...

37:46.310 --> 37:52.779
Certainly not opposed to... But you know all of the things that goes on there.

37:52.799 --> 38:00.469
It's a question of tenure and the pressure for tenure and raises and all of that.

38:00.489 --> 38:04.394
But what happens to this whole concept of history of the book?

38:04.615 --> 38:07.879
You guys aren't going to go out of business for many years to come, to be sure.

38:08.517 --> 38:25.222
But as books, I mean, as you are unable to determine variants and bindings and printing records and, you know, as things become, as there's no way to determine how many people are reading something off an Internet or something, what does that mean?

38:25.363 --> 38:28.888
Is that something that will be lost, do you think?

38:32.243 --> 38:35.428
as printing moves closer and closer to electronic printing?

38:35.748 --> 38:37.110
I don't think so.

38:37.150 --> 38:39.613
I mean, I think it will just raise different questions.

38:41.015 --> 38:48.346
I mean, I always challenge my graduate students to figure out how to do bibliographical work with electronic text.

38:49.788 --> 38:50.629
And, you know, you can.

38:50.969 --> 39:00.563
Your hard disk is a physical medium, and your files on that hard disk are laid out in a certain way.

39:01.505 --> 39:05.891
And by looking at the ways they're laid out, you can determine the order in which they were laid onto them.

39:05.911 --> 39:14.001
I mean, you know, there are all kinds of things that one can do that's analogous to just straightforward analytical bibliography.

39:15.143 --> 39:18.307
Well, I'm thinking about my book, which was written on a computer.

39:19.268 --> 39:26.938
And, you know, this whole concept of, I mean, this is nonfiction, so who cares if this is a variant text or not?

39:27.357 --> 39:30.761
But I have no idea how many drafts there were.

39:31.402 --> 39:35.267
I mean, maybe some paragraphs might have been written 150 times.

39:35.287 --> 39:38.130
There's no way of knowing until you print out a version.

39:40.113 --> 39:42.095
That's certainly going to be lost.

39:43.437 --> 39:46.421
You see manuscripts going into publishers now clean as a whistle.

39:46.741 --> 39:48.143
No typos.

39:48.163 --> 39:49.264
They've been spelt.

39:49.565 --> 39:50.766
Publishers also say that they're longer.

39:51.421 --> 39:54.967
They are longer, especially nonfiction books, because you can just add.

39:55.388 --> 39:58.553
It's adding stuff as a snap, you know?

39:58.573 --> 40:01.978
You can just, I mean, pagination is no longer a problem.

40:02.018 --> 40:07.808
I remember the last time I said I'm not going to type a paper over just to correct it.

40:07.828 --> 40:07.968
Yeah.

40:08.589 --> 40:12.015
That's when I bought a computer.

40:12.035 --> 40:13.077
No, yeah, things will change.

40:13.377 --> 40:16.462
I mean, that's, but I don't, there's kinds of questions.

40:16.482 --> 40:18.205
I mean, I think the history, the book,

40:21.172 --> 40:25.779
is really a discussion about verbal communication.

40:30.026 --> 40:40.884
I think that one of the reasons it's powerful is that... Actually, it's verbal communication in... How do I say this?

40:41.465 --> 40:43.348
I'm sorry, I'm tripping up over myself.

40:47.463 --> 40:55.711
It's not just the study of the communication, it's also the study of the sort of material forms that verbal communication takes place.

40:55.731 --> 41:03.959
And I think that we will find that, you know, electronic communication has its material forms.

41:03.979 --> 41:10.305
It's just that we're just not very used yet to talking or understanding them.

41:10.365 --> 41:13.048
I think you're right, actually.

41:13.552 --> 41:19.342
in ways we don't have a clue just yet, but there will be a way.

41:19.822 --> 41:21.545
You're mentioning hard disks.

41:22.487 --> 41:26.914
You know, some way is going to come along to divine how the hell this stuff is in there.

41:27.174 --> 41:35.809
Well, you remember when the Microsoft files had corrupted pieces in them that you could read.

41:37.171 --> 41:38.513
I mean, all that stuff, you know.

41:40.332 --> 41:41.194
I think so.

41:43.458 --> 41:45.722
Listen, we've chatted for a good while here.

41:46.664 --> 41:49.670
And I hope I haven't.

41:49.690 --> 41:50.511
No, it's good.

41:50.531 --> 41:55.361
I've taken notes so I can use them for this Biblio piece, but then I've also recorded here.

41:55.621 --> 41:57.865
And I'd love to continue this.

41:57.885 --> 41:59.809
I'd really like to talk about, you know,

42:00.110 --> 42:01.011
bibliography.

42:01.031 --> 42:02.153
I'd love to do a chapter.

42:02.934 --> 42:09.284
It's almost a challenge for myself to explain why and how the study of books is text.

42:10.165 --> 42:11.707
How this can be a fascinating thing.

42:14.952 --> 42:20.380
I think your work, for instance, on BAL is fascinating to me.

42:21.187 --> 42:23.730
And I've done a couple of little interviews.

42:24.590 --> 42:28.094
Have you heard of Audrey Hanneman out in the Midwest?

42:28.715 --> 42:31.017
Remember, she did the Hemingway bibliography?

42:31.037 --> 42:32.398
Oh, right, of course.

42:32.418 --> 42:34.320
She never even graduated from high school.

42:34.640 --> 42:39.625
And the book has probably sold over 30 years.

42:39.726 --> 42:41.888
Princeton finally let it go out of print after 30 years.

42:41.908 --> 42:43.049
I think it was 4,000.

42:43.349 --> 42:46.392
And yet when you're talking modern first editions, they all mention Hanneman.

42:46.572 --> 42:51.177
Well, anyway, that's a pretty interesting little story.

42:51.511 --> 42:58.565
Maybe we can talk about just about bibliography and what it means in studies of books and stuff.

42:58.625 --> 43:01.190
I'd love to talk about that with you.

43:02.653 --> 43:07.883
Either when you come to Worcester, although you might be busy, or if you don't mind doing a telephoner like this,

43:08.555 --> 43:09.937
Not particularly.

43:10.639 --> 43:12.001
You don't mind doing a telephone?

43:12.041 --> 43:13.523
No, not really.

43:13.544 --> 43:14.545
Good.

43:14.565 --> 43:19.955
Well, let me absorb this, if I may, and I'll give you a call and we can set something up.

43:20.355 --> 43:20.576
Okay.

43:20.916 --> 43:21.978
And thank you so much.

43:22.399 --> 43:22.940
Well, thank you.

43:23.020 --> 43:23.561
Appreciate it.

43:24.162 --> 43:24.622
Bye-bye.

43:24.643 --> 43:24.943
Bye-bye.
