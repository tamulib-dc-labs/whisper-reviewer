WEBVTT

00:02.242 --> 00:04.085
You don't mind?

00:04.105 --> 00:04.626
No, I don't mind.

00:04.646 --> 00:07.991
I'm talking to Professor Harold Bloom.

00:08.011 --> 00:24.516
No, I was just thinking, when I mentioned Alexandria, that in some sense, what Alexandria was... Ah, let me just get this right here.

00:24.536 --> 00:31.506
What Alexandria was to an older culture, the fall of the book culture itself, that is to say,

00:32.026 --> 00:35.270
We are Alexander... Somebody got the wrong limit.

00:38.274 --> 00:58.779
No, I... I believe, and increasingly, that people like you and myself, Nicholas, for whom books are the best part of life and have been the best part of life, that essentially we live in Alexandria.

00:59.159 --> 00:59.620
We live...

01:00.308 --> 01:02.190
and an Alexandria of the mind.

01:04.533 --> 01:07.377
And the best name for it, so far as I know, would be Alexandria.

01:07.858 --> 01:22.756
That is to say, that vision of a literary culture is essentially an Alexandria, a Hellenistic nation.

01:25.440 --> 01:29.725
And it appears to me

01:32.877 --> 01:40.485
In that sense, it depended upon the inner ear, which is, after all, what matters most in reading.

01:43.688 --> 02:01.787
That an age in which success of the motion picture screen, television screen, and now the computer screen, and now the projections out from the community, you know, the virtual reality into which we are going, dooms literary culture, as we Alexandrians have known it.

02:03.168 --> 02:04.530
This is a departure for you.

02:04.570 --> 02:06.974
You didn't feel this way ten years ago, I don't think.

02:07.875 --> 02:18.732
No, I think ten years ago I was already very distressed.

02:19.213 --> 02:28.928
You were distressed, but I read your Paris Review interview, and you were hoping, I guess, that this would live on the screen, I guess.

02:28.948 --> 02:30.390
I was hoping one could fight.

02:30.758 --> 02:48.882
one can not only fight the age of the visual, but fight what I would call the treason of the critics, the absolute sell-out of the supposed literary culture of the academies.

02:51.265 --> 02:59.736
But ten years later, I am more quietistic.

03:00.863 --> 03:03.026
I guess you've just finished reading that book of mine.

03:04.848 --> 03:06.070
Very kind of you.

03:08.193 --> 03:16.003
But it is, in a sense, a quietistic book, because it does not offer itself any hope.

03:17.184 --> 03:28.339
I end with a sermon, but I make very clear, as I start the sermon, I say, look, if you are a professing

03:30.260 --> 03:36.127
personage in any mode of belief whatsoever, I have no authority to address you.

03:36.147 --> 03:39.772
And you learn how to listen if you don't want to.

03:39.832 --> 03:53.348
If you are, however, some kind of a seeker, if in that more profound sense you are unchurched, perhaps something that I am saved will find you.

03:58.627 --> 04:01.151
I suppose for me there is a deep affinity.

04:02.913 --> 04:05.737
Literary culture is the invention of Alexandria.

04:06.859 --> 04:12.267
Gnosticism appears to have been the invention of Alexandrian Jewry to begin with.

04:14.370 --> 04:23.964
And I would mean though it may have roots in Palestinian Jewry and in Samaria of a slightly earlier period.

04:25.506 --> 04:28.330
But I think that Gnosticism and literary culture

04:29.609 --> 04:32.994
Gnosticism is almost the religion of illiterary culture.

04:39.425 --> 04:42.469
And as one dies, the other in some sense dies also.

04:44.873 --> 04:50.482
You had an experience in the 60s with an angel, didn't you, you said?

04:50.502 --> 04:54.568
Well, not a terrifying angel.

04:54.629 --> 04:56.832
The covering cherub.

04:58.381 --> 05:07.749
I had a dream at dawn on my 37th birthday.

05:09.531 --> 05:24.524
I was coming out of a dream in which a horrible, huge mimshak heruv, as it is called in the Hebrew Bible, the covering cherub, was suffocating me.

05:24.725 --> 05:26.346
The wings were suffocating me.

05:26.967 --> 05:28.569
War, I'm still not sure.

05:28.589 --> 05:30.891
I puzzled about it for a long time afterwards.

05:31.912 --> 05:32.833
I'm still not sure.

05:33.433 --> 05:44.865
Of course, you've written and lectured and interviewed at great length on Shakespeare, of course, but on Freud, and you've discussed your own therapy.

05:45.325 --> 05:46.667
Dreams come in tough.

05:47.788 --> 05:53.093
The question begs to be asked, have you tried to look at that dream in any way other than just a dream?

05:56.414 --> 06:00.018
Well, for me it was a pragmatic dream and its consequences.

06:03.783 --> 06:26.370
In a book of mine, a collection put together of selected writings, Poetics of Influence, edited with an introduction by John Hollander for the volume of New and Selected Criticism, which was published back around 1988 or so, I reprinted because

06:26.873 --> 06:33.741
A copy of it was found by my friend Joe Trapp, the librarian then at the Warburg Institute in London.

06:34.502 --> 06:55.868
Gumbridge had heard me give this strange Githyramb-like long, weird lecture called The Covering Cherub or Poetic Influence at the Society for the Humanities at Cornell, where my wife and I and our little boys had gone to spend the year

06:56.843 --> 06:59.526
starting with September 1968.

07:03.670 --> 07:11.359
And it was something that I wrote starting on July 11th.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.204
In 1967, directly I came up out of that dream.

07:17.825 --> 07:24.893
And then in revised and much more rationalized form, it became the Klinomen, or first chapter,

07:25.295 --> 07:28.881
of a little book called The Anxiety of Influence in January 1973.

07:29.021 --> 07:39.338
And in some sense, it changed my work and my life forever, that dream, if it was a dream.

07:42.603 --> 07:52.078
If I had, I suppose, a deeper,

07:54.860 --> 08:02.149
gnosis of myself, and therefore had more spiritual self-confidence than I easily have.

08:03.630 --> 08:12.040
I would probably say, my dear Nicholas, that it wasn't a dream, but it was some sort of angelic visitation.

08:13.842 --> 08:20.530
It was certainly frighteningly tactile, but it seemed to take place between sleep and waking.

08:24.323 --> 08:30.248
or since, and it has governed everything I've done now for 30 years.

08:32.731 --> 08:45.362
Since my work changed radically, with that covering Charupo, Poetic Influence, Dithyaram, it became the seed of everything I've written ever since, in one form or another.

08:46.743 --> 08:51.748
Not just all the works about poetic influence, but...

08:54.800 --> 08:58.084
curious religious turn, if that's what it is.

08:59.026 --> 09:17.110
That started in the 1990s, or late 1980s, and that would ruin the sacred truth, and had gone before it, and then went on to the Book of Jay and the American religion, and the sort of underlying argument to the Western canon, and now this very strange book.

09:17.230 --> 09:22.898
This is a weird book, because as I myself... You can call it weird.

09:22.918 --> 09:24.520
As I myself realized...

09:25.293 --> 09:29.898
Only a couple of people besides you have read it as yet, because it's been held up.

09:30.119 --> 09:34.724
It's going to be published next Wednesday, on September the 4th.

09:35.265 --> 09:37.708
But I don't think it'll be in bookstores until next Wednesday.

09:37.748 --> 09:40.491
I'll wait a couple of weeks, by the way, before I get my piece up.

09:40.511 --> 09:40.892
Sure, sure.

09:40.972 --> 09:43.314
I would like it to be in bookstores.

09:43.935 --> 09:52.405
I don't think it can be in bookstores until September the 4th, because the printer made a mistake in that opening epigraph, a mistake after everything was all done.

09:52.445 --> 09:53.106
It wasn't a...

09:53.930 --> 09:58.317
They tried to fancily rearrange that opening epigraph from Lawrence Durrell.

09:59.299 --> 10:02.464
And in doing it, they changed the word question into questie.

10:03.045 --> 10:04.427
And I shrugged my shoulders.

10:04.527 --> 10:05.869
I said, this is an atrocity.

10:06.390 --> 10:14.083
I said to my editor, Cindy Spiegel, and through her to my publisher at Riverhead, Susan Peterson, what can we do?

10:14.123 --> 10:17.228
I said, we've got 33,000 copies of this, the first printing.

10:18.370 --> 10:21.034
And Susan Peterson said, no, she wouldn't stand for it.

10:21.605 --> 10:28.592
She was going to send it back to the printer, and at the printer's expense, they were going to have to tip in 33,000 epigraph pages.

10:29.133 --> 10:33.517
And I said, but my dear, that will take like three, four weeks.

10:33.537 --> 10:39.483
The book isn't even going to be in bookstores on publication date the 4th, and you're not going to be able to stop certain reviews.

10:39.823 --> 10:45.769
And indeed, there was an article already, I'm told, though I haven't seen it, although not a review.

10:45.789 --> 10:47.711
But they didn't pick up on that.

10:47.731 --> 10:51.595
There was an article in the Baltimore... Pardon me, I'm just checking

10:55.220 --> 11:24.906
long before there can be books in bookstores there are as of today there's no book in a bookstore anywhere in North America it will I'm told this morning when I complained about this or worried about this over the phone they assured me that it would land as they put it in the bookstores simultaneously with their other September the 4th publication which is of course printed four times the amount Mr. Art Buchwald's memoir about how much he loved Paris

11:25.628 --> 11:27.731
I talked to him about that book.

11:27.751 --> 11:33.781
Art Buchwald and I are supposed to hit the bookstores together on publication date, September the 4th.

11:35.885 --> 11:37.908
So only a couple of people have read it, Nick.

11:37.948 --> 11:43.176
You've read it, and my friend Jonathan Spence, the Chinese historian, and one or two others.

11:44.959 --> 11:49.887
And Jonathan pointed out to me what I knew already, that it's no genre whatsoever.

11:50.769 --> 11:51.670
I mean, what is the book?

11:52.051 --> 11:52.952
I wouldn't know how to...

11:53.438 --> 11:55.100
I don't know how to describe the book.

11:55.200 --> 11:58.684
It's not really a book about religion.

11:59.765 --> 12:00.686
Is it a meditation?

12:02.648 --> 12:03.609
Maybe.

12:03.629 --> 12:05.191
I have no idea of qualities.

12:05.391 --> 12:05.872
I don't know.

12:05.952 --> 12:19.387
At one point I remember early on in it, being puzzled by it myself, I actually said that not just the last chapter or section of this is a Gnostic sermon, maybe in some sense this entire book is a Gnostic sermon.

12:19.948 --> 12:21.169
I said, that's probably the answer.

12:21.209 --> 12:21.910
It's a sermon.

12:22.632 --> 12:30.483
It's sort of a short book, but a long sermon of a Gnostic kind.

12:30.503 --> 12:32.466
But of course, a Gnostic sermon is a choke.

12:33.448 --> 12:34.429
It's a deliberate choke.

12:35.451 --> 12:37.073
There cannot be a Gnostic sermon.

12:37.574 --> 12:39.076
There can be a Protestant sermon.

12:39.156 --> 12:41.259
There can be a Judaic sermon.

12:41.319 --> 12:43.663
There can be a Muslim sermon.

12:43.743 --> 12:45.786
There could be a Catholic sermon.

12:46.487 --> 12:48.510
There can be, I suppose, a Buddhist sermon.

12:48.530 --> 12:50.833
I know very little about Buddhism.

12:51.691 --> 12:53.493
But there cannot be a Gnostic servant.

12:54.555 --> 12:58.800
There's no one to give it and no one to listen to it.

12:58.820 --> 13:01.463
And no place to hold it.

13:01.483 --> 13:03.466
Where did this come from?

13:04.146 --> 13:13.077
I mean, the time certainly anticipates, you know, a new millennium.

13:13.098 --> 13:17.944
Is this what inspired you, do you think, to cut the creative juices flowing?

13:17.964 --> 13:20.787
No, no, it goes all the way back.

13:20.952 --> 13:28.460
I think you've already told me about the... When I was a little boy, a big bar mitzvah at 13, I was already in rebellion.

13:28.981 --> 13:31.964
You know, they gave me a high orthodox education.

13:32.084 --> 13:38.672
My parents, after all, were very pious East European Jews, and I was always getting into fights with the rabbis.

13:39.553 --> 13:50.605
When I was 11 and 12 years old, I was having terrible fights with them because I was not interpreting a sculpture the way Rashi would have me interpret them.

13:51.631 --> 14:19.562
scripture I remember asking a rabbi when I was 12 years old why God tried to murder Moses and I was given the great answer that Rashi gives because he stops at night when God has sent him down into Egypt and carries

14:20.943 --> 14:25.707
And, of course, that's not in the text.

14:26.468 --> 14:36.297
The Hebrew makes perfectly clear that if you are going through the wilderness of Zin, the Negev, at night, of course you make an encampment.

14:37.598 --> 14:49.228
So Moses makes an encampment there at night, and then as the text shockingly says, Yahweh tries to murder him, tries to kill him for no reason whatsoever.

14:50.086 --> 14:59.639
And even as a 12-year-old, and that is 54 years ago, I got into a terrible fight with the rabbis about that.

14:59.679 --> 15:01.301
I said, there's something very wrong here.

15:02.383 --> 15:03.524
And they said, no, no, no.

15:04.345 --> 15:05.367
There's nothing wrong here.

15:07.389 --> 15:09.412
So I guess that's always been in me.

15:09.592 --> 15:10.333
I've always been.

15:10.373 --> 15:19.165
As far back as I can remember, even before I knew that there was such a thing as a Jewish Gnostic, even before I first heard of

15:19.702 --> 15:27.912
what the Talmud calls the Minim, who are obviously the Jewish Gnostics of the first two centuries of the common era.

15:28.893 --> 15:39.265
I was one already, but it did get all mixed in with a passion for poetry, as I explained early on in that book.

15:44.912 --> 15:47.835
But then the occasion of the book, not the inspiration for it,

15:48.203 --> 15:52.527
The book in that sense, you know, has been moving around in me for more than half a century.

15:53.928 --> 15:57.292
But the occasion for the book was my bemusement.

15:57.912 --> 16:16.810
I used to sit around with Glenn Hartley, our mutual agent, splendid man as you know, and have conversations with him in which I would brood out loud about the madness of the obsession with angels in the United States throughout the late 80s and all through the 90s.

16:17.802 --> 16:31.957
And then this insane preoccupation with the near-death experience, on which I would say the best thing that's been said is my remark somewhere in that book where I say, well, all of life is near-death experience.

16:31.977 --> 16:34.040
Which we see for under life, of course.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.721
That can almost be my lead, you know.

16:36.002 --> 16:43.590
And then I've always been fascinated by Freud, though increasingly rebellious towards him,

16:47.519 --> 17:01.793
And I reread The Interpretation of Dreams a couple of years ago and started to read Freud again in later essays and dreams and telepathy and so on.

17:02.834 --> 17:05.577
And suddenly it struck me there was something very odd there.

17:05.617 --> 17:14.826
So I started getting much more interested in dreams than I'd ever been before in the literature dreams and learned a great deal about it.

17:16.156 --> 17:37.023
And I finally had to say to myself, here is a Western tradition, a dream interpretation, going back 1800, 1900 years before Freud, including a Jewish tradition of dream interpretation.

17:38.125 --> 17:45.775
You know, all of that material, but I cited from the Talmud, and much, much more than I had time to cite, from the Zohar.

17:46.126 --> 17:52.272
the major text of the Kabbalah.

17:52.292 --> 18:05.484
And it just seems to me much closer to what I intuitively understand about dreams or what I have learned about dreams by listening to other people's dreams or the way I've encountered dreams in literature.

18:06.886 --> 18:12.471
It does seem to me that Freud is neglecting

18:15.387 --> 18:29.026
the ultimate aspect of dreams, which is that they have a, not a narrowly predictive function, but they do have a kind of apotropaic function.

18:30.107 --> 18:36.296
Something I didn't really talk about in that book, I mean, they're a warding off matter.

18:36.416 --> 18:40.281
They do deal with both good and bad things that are coming, and they defend

18:41.628 --> 18:42.329
against it.

18:42.429 --> 19:00.565
And then I got very fascinated, I must say, as the book shows, with, um, that strange Talmudist and Kabbalist, uh, Joseph Karoff, or Svad, with his crazy Magid, his crazy answering angel.

19:02.107 --> 19:11.415
And then, I think that's what really got the book started, because I started thinking, I know this guy, Werblowski, who'd written the basic book on Karoff,

19:12.087 --> 19:14.450
I remembered some conversations I'd had with him.

19:15.832 --> 19:28.169
And then I'm a good friend of Moshe Ido, who I think is the great living Kabbalah scholar, the only one who's a real rival to and corrective to Sholem, whom I also knew and liked very much.

19:29.791 --> 19:39.023
I was talking to Moshe Ido about it, and I gradually saw that what I wanted to do, if I could do it, was to write a book on...

19:41.551 --> 19:46.859
angels, near-death experiences, dreams, this whole current sure and awry.

19:48.341 --> 20:09.752
But to put it in the context, I thought of the sages who had really understood these things out of a whole series of Western traditions, all of them ultimately allied by hermeticism, or hermitism, which is sort of secular, or by hermitism.

20:09.901 --> 20:13.645
a Judeo-Christian Muslim gnosis.

20:13.665 --> 20:19.150
I didn't realize I hadn't read much Henri Corban at that point.

20:19.911 --> 20:31.682
I then read all of him, both French and English, and then started to look at the text he had translated into French, since I cannot read Iranian or Arabic.

20:32.123 --> 20:37.528
But I became more and more fascinated by that special branch of the Sufis,

20:38.588 --> 20:46.439
You know, the Iranian Shiite Sufis, upon whom Korban was the great modern scholar.

20:47.681 --> 21:08.511
And it seemed to me that they had more to say in a kind of breathtakingly clear way about these matters in a less so contradictory form than Kabbalah did or than perhaps earlier versions of Gnosticism did

21:10.550 --> 21:13.794
But I still had no idea, Nicholas, what that book would turn out to be.

21:13.814 --> 21:16.758
I mean, I didn't think I was writing a sermon.

21:16.798 --> 21:31.676
I thought I would write a gently humorous account trying to say, look, this New Age jazz is no good and this popular debasement is no good either.

21:31.956 --> 21:39.105
But the reason why we are moved by it on many levels

21:40.570 --> 21:54.889
and, you know, people of great subtlety as well as people, or shall we say rather less, is that this has always been the tradition of Gnosis.

21:55.029 --> 21:58.574
This has always been a way of getting at these things.

22:00.977 --> 22:03.741
Well, I still did not understand the book as I wrote it.

22:04.222 --> 22:05.363
For such a short book,

22:06.271 --> 22:07.212
It surprised me.

22:07.232 --> 22:08.334
It took two full years.

22:08.635 --> 22:12.681
It took as long to write that book as it did that huge book on the Western Canon.

22:12.761 --> 22:14.003
That's amazing.

22:14.023 --> 22:17.488
It took me two full years, because I couldn't quite understand.

22:17.508 --> 22:19.211
I kept writing it and rewriting it.

22:19.451 --> 22:21.274
Were you intimidated by it in any way?

22:21.294 --> 22:23.858
No, I just couldn't figure out what I was doing.

22:23.898 --> 22:34.675
And after a while, I think, you know, Goethe once said beautifully, Es dictet en mir, that is to say,

22:36.005 --> 22:37.086
I don't write the poems.

22:37.146 --> 22:38.347
They write themselves in me.

22:38.447 --> 22:42.431
Obviously, I'm not writing a poem or a prose poem.

22:42.631 --> 22:53.101
But finally, this wrote itself, but more or less sort of sometimes against me or against parts of me.

22:56.704 --> 23:04.292
I really have no idea what is going to happen to this book, because I take it for granted that most reviewers will just be outraged.

23:04.312 --> 23:04.712
Oh, okay.

23:05.857 --> 23:06.578
You don't think so?

23:07.639 --> 23:10.801
Well, why should we be outraged?

23:11.042 --> 23:30.799
Well, if they are... If they are, you know, pious Protestants, whether mainline or sects, or if they are pious Catholics or they are pious Jews, you know, they will say, how dare he say this sort of thing.

23:34.382 --> 23:35.323
But also, I just think

23:35.624 --> 23:37.386
what I call the weirdness of the book.

23:39.788 --> 23:41.890
You seem to have some misgivings here.

23:41.910 --> 23:44.352
Oh, I have a lot of misgivings about this book.

23:44.512 --> 23:57.604
I guess that's why I got upset when that mistake showed up, and Susan Peterson said she wouldn't let it stand, even though it meant the book would be in the bookstores three to four weeks later.

23:57.644 --> 24:02.509
And she overruled me on it, and I said, well, be it on your head, you know.

24:02.860 --> 24:08.969
Um, because I think we may get the weird situation that there'll be books and articles out there.

24:08.989 --> 24:11.653
I mean, there'll be reviews and articles out there, but there won't be any books.

24:11.913 --> 24:12.895
Yeah, that's terrible.

24:12.915 --> 24:14.117
You don't want that to happen.

24:14.137 --> 24:16.560
Well, it might happen, because... It might happen.

24:16.780 --> 24:18.603
Now, did they tip in 33,000?

24:18.904 --> 24:19.044
Yeah.

24:19.144 --> 24:19.464
Wow.

24:21.167 --> 24:21.487
Yeah.

24:21.768 --> 24:25.013
That's not an inexpensive... Well, they didn't pay, though.

24:25.033 --> 24:27.196
I understand, but I mean... The prints are paid.

24:28.017 --> 24:29.339
Um, but they're insisting on it.

24:29.860 --> 24:30.100
Um,

24:31.244 --> 24:35.489
I would have been willing, and I would have been happy with the blemish, but I would have gone along with it.

24:39.313 --> 24:40.875
But they wouldn't do it.

24:42.857 --> 24:48.062
So I feel snaked good about this book already, and of course that's just superstition.

24:49.504 --> 24:56.652
I just feel, though, that I don't know where they'll find reviewers for it.

24:56.772 --> 24:57.673
I don't know...

25:00.370 --> 25:09.202
Well, you wonder if they'll find reviewers, but you must be, your last two books have been certifiable bestsellers, which is amazing.

25:09.222 --> 25:10.163
Well, two out of three.

25:10.583 --> 25:13.487
The Book of Jay was a bestseller, and The Western Canon.

25:13.688 --> 25:19.976
In between was a book that I think was better than either, the one called The American Religion, and that was not a bestseller.

25:21.137 --> 25:22.980
And that was harshly handled.

25:24.261 --> 25:27.285
By the establishments of the group?

25:27.706 --> 25:28.487
Yeah, yeah.

25:29.598 --> 25:35.367
This book is not quite like that, but it's closer to that than it is to the other two.

25:35.507 --> 25:45.442
But where you express justifiably this anxiety about the dearth of readers, and yet these very deep books are being bought and read.

25:46.484 --> 25:48.127
How do you explain that?

25:48.147 --> 25:49.769
I don't understand it at all, Nicholas.

25:50.310 --> 25:51.472
I don't even understand.

25:51.492 --> 25:56.179
I can't deal with the letters I've been getting for the last three, four, five years.

25:57.374 --> 26:00.559
by getting an enormous number of letters every day.

26:01.360 --> 26:02.502
Sometimes they're nasty.

26:03.023 --> 26:05.407
I just throw them away very frequently.

26:05.447 --> 26:10.936
They're sensitive and good-natured and even gracious and grateful.

26:12.058 --> 26:14.101
But I haven't got time and energy to answer them.

26:14.181 --> 26:15.844
I'm too embarrassed to answer them anyway.

26:15.864 --> 26:16.905
I don't know what to say.

26:17.927 --> 26:24.698
Are the nasty ones basically from the Western canon, I would imagine?

26:24.982 --> 26:27.324
Well, no, they're from everything.

26:27.564 --> 26:29.106
And why do you work?

26:29.126 --> 26:32.949
There's a certain amount of anti-Semitism.

26:33.269 --> 26:39.315
I get some anti-Semitic letters, and I may get some more about this one.

26:39.435 --> 26:54.448
After all, I've written, I don't know if you ever saw it, a couple of years ago, two, three, four years ago, I wrote another Gnostic sermon, a short one,

26:57.854 --> 27:09.071
by Harper San Francisco at the end of their edition of the Gospel of Thomas, done by Martin Mayer.

27:09.832 --> 27:13.999
And I've gotten a certain number of nasty letters about that.

27:15.020 --> 27:17.264
And I guess I'll get nastier letters about this.

27:17.444 --> 27:22.832
I mean, if you say many times in the course of a book,

27:24.095 --> 27:26.278
that there were really, in effect, just two Christians.

27:26.378 --> 27:30.464
One was Jesus, and the other was his brother, James the Just.

27:30.484 --> 27:32.126
And they appeared to have been Gnostics.

27:32.827 --> 27:37.414
Do you smile when you write these?

27:37.434 --> 27:40.779
That's kind of... I don't know whether to smile or not.

27:42.321 --> 27:51.194
I don't know why I... Well, I mean, it may well be that a year from now, or even three months from now, I wish I hadn't written this book.

27:52.075 --> 27:52.836
I don't know.

27:54.267 --> 27:57.852
I really feel there's a jinx on it already.

27:57.872 --> 28:01.778
I think it's a very fine book, mind you.

28:01.838 --> 28:09.449
I mean, I read it through when I got a first printed copy of it, in spite of that horrible questie rather than question.

28:10.690 --> 28:11.912
I felt two things about it.

28:12.052 --> 28:14.836
One, even though it was such a personal book, I didn't feel I'd written it.

28:15.878 --> 28:23.008
And secondly, I felt it was a very fine book, probably the best book I'd ever written, but...

28:24.777 --> 28:26.940
I also thought, God help me.

28:27.881 --> 28:32.627
I just think they're going to line up to take shots at me.

28:32.647 --> 28:33.929
But they've been doing that anyway.

28:33.949 --> 28:35.270
They've been doing that all the time.

28:35.310 --> 28:48.507
Anyway, and of course, by now, I'm 66, and it rolls off me like the water off the proverbial duck, because, you know, you can take only so many shots after that.

28:48.547 --> 28:49.568
You don't feel it anymore.

28:50.529 --> 28:53.333
And besides, what can they do to me by now?

28:54.140 --> 28:57.224
They've said everything they can already.

28:57.304 --> 29:11.945
I mean, the sheer nastiness of the New York Times magazine, which I considered suing about, where they were inventing a sex life for me with female students, which I, in fact, did not have.

29:13.307 --> 29:15.089
It was pretty vicious stuff.

29:15.270 --> 29:19.155
I will never forgive Mr. James Atlas, who... When was this?

29:19.175 --> 29:22.780
This was a dreadful fellow, but goes back a little ways.

29:23.401 --> 29:30.627
The New York Times Magazine, when the Western Canon was published, assigned a nasty little hitman.

29:31.188 --> 29:32.949
I've met Atlas, because he has a little guy.

29:33.189 --> 29:33.790
Oh, no, no.

29:34.130 --> 29:35.231
Atlas was the editor.

29:35.391 --> 29:35.772
Oh, Atlas.

29:35.792 --> 29:42.157
The guy he assigned was a nasty little guy named Begley, the son of the novelist Louis Begley.

29:42.317 --> 29:43.258
Yeah, Begley's son.

29:43.278 --> 29:44.419
Yeah, Adam Begley.

29:45.160 --> 29:52.166
And this Adam Begley did a hateful piece on me, which I didn't read, but people told me what was in it.

29:52.186 --> 29:52.446
Um...

29:55.396 --> 29:56.798
It was a personal piece, I gather.

29:56.858 --> 29:57.939
It was a nasty piece.

29:59.041 --> 30:02.365
And it... I don't know it.

30:02.385 --> 30:07.532
Well... No, but I'm just... And I went back to a very nasty piece.

30:07.552 --> 30:24.694
When I was recovering from both bleeding ulcers and a heart attack, when I suggested what I was doing, I stupidly gave an interview to a hatchet guy from Gentleman's Quarterly many years ago, and he wrote a violently nasty piece about me, full of lies.

30:25.568 --> 30:29.532
And, I mean, it was horrible.

30:30.133 --> 30:37.380
So, you know, one has already been so vituperated that, in a way, one is now armored against anything.

30:39.362 --> 30:42.445
There isn't that kind of thing that bothers me in connection with this book.

30:42.505 --> 30:53.837
I just wonder, once it gets into bookstores and whatever kind of reviews or notices it does or doesn't get,

30:55.032 --> 31:02.942
I just wonder, um, I'm not sure who the readers are for this book.

31:02.982 --> 31:04.584
I'm not sure whether they're the same people.

31:04.985 --> 31:08.810
Well, you've had your readers, but we certainly have readers who read you.

31:08.970 --> 31:11.994
By now, I think I'll probably have a certain number of readers.

31:12.434 --> 31:21.926
Um, whether the people who bought and read the Reston Canon and, uh, the Book of Jay and some other stuff will buy and read this, I don't know.

31:22.807 --> 31:24.109
I guess I'll have to find out.

31:24.590 --> 31:24.870
Um,

31:26.622 --> 31:40.455
What it was intended for, it may just be... I tried to make it, as you can tell as you read it, that's why I had to rewrite it so much, I tried to make it not just as lucid as possible, but as simple as possible.

31:40.476 --> 31:41.076
It's very clear.

31:41.236 --> 31:43.318
I was reading it to my wife last night.

31:43.338 --> 31:48.984
But what is writing about matters about which no one has ever been clear, if I may say so.

31:49.064 --> 31:53.288
I mean, you write about the astral body, or you write about resurrection and so on,

31:53.909 --> 31:57.332
and you write about it with clarity, and you're doing a sort of spooky thing.

31:58.354 --> 32:02.298
And I felt spooky as I read through the book.

32:02.378 --> 32:23.359
I thought, that's a very interesting, you know, technical solution I found for the difficulty of how to present that, but I had to keep asking myself, will, you know, there are all these people who buy these terrible New Age books, who read

32:23.609 --> 32:29.897
Real garbage is like, what is the thing called, the Celestine Prophecy, which I can't get through a sentence of.

32:31.079 --> 32:46.779
There are these people who read all this crap about angels, who read all this garbage about near-death experiences, who read all this incredibly bad psychic dream stuff.

32:47.300 --> 32:52.907
And I was asking myself, is it possible to get people...

32:54.187 --> 33:15.129
who fill up on this drivel, who really are questing for something, who have a kind of authentic drive towards trying to understand what it is that these matters represent.

33:15.829 --> 33:18.853
Is it possible to so write the book that they could read it?

33:19.413 --> 33:20.855
I don't know what the answer to that is.

33:21.635 --> 33:22.236
I'm wondering if

33:23.549 --> 33:29.619
particular crowd, these people who are reading the New Age, who are looking for the simple answer.

33:29.839 --> 33:30.179
Sure.

33:30.280 --> 33:32.563
I wonder if they're up to reading this book.

33:32.583 --> 33:34.827
Well, I wonder also.

33:34.927 --> 33:41.938
I kept it as simple as possible, but it doesn't offer any answers.

33:42.198 --> 33:44.142
The writing is very lucid and clear.

33:45.103 --> 33:47.427
The message remains quite deep and profound.

33:47.587 --> 33:50.772
The message is a troubling one, and the message is a

33:53.215 --> 33:54.556
I guess the message is double.

33:54.596 --> 34:00.322
If I had to summarize it, Nick, I would say the two Muslim world things in the book, and they feed into each other.

34:01.163 --> 34:21.383
On the one hand, that notion which I take from Henry Corban's account of the Sufis, of what he calls the imaginal world, that sort of middle realm between the transcendental and the empirical, which I think is akin to imaginative literature, though it isn't quite the same thing.

34:21.582 --> 34:35.836
And in trying to rely upon that as being no more or less real, in both the empirical and the transcendental, I pose one kind of a problem.

34:37.998 --> 34:44.224
And then by saying that, the ultimate home of the imaginal is, after all, in your relationship to yourself.

34:45.966 --> 34:48.248
Isn't your sense that there is some part of you

34:49.105 --> 34:56.497
which is better and older and more original than the rest of you, you know, in invoking what Emerson really meant by self-reliance.

34:58.200 --> 35:02.146
What got you going on Gingrich and Mrs. Huffington in the book?

35:02.166 --> 35:03.488
I mean, and you keep coming back.

35:03.789 --> 35:07.194
You must use at least ten different words to describe Dean Gingrich.

35:07.214 --> 35:09.518
I mean, modifications obviously.

35:10.359 --> 35:12.783
And this is Glenn's client, too.

35:12.803 --> 35:13.745
He's so nocesome.

35:14.566 --> 35:15.788
I suppose...

35:16.105 --> 35:20.131
Because I really think he is a right-wing Gnostic, though he doesn't know he's a Gnostic.

35:20.291 --> 35:23.015
He thinks he's some sort of orthodox Christian.

35:23.115 --> 35:41.961
But with his obsession with information, with his aversion to matter and energy, as it were, in favor of information, with his astonishing... I mean, I think he's a very evil man.

35:42.683 --> 35:43.684
Very dreadful man.

35:43.744 --> 35:44.365
I quite agree.

35:44.545 --> 35:47.950
I've had a number of fights with better men about this.

35:48.070 --> 35:50.232
They begged me to take out all mentions to him.

35:50.373 --> 35:59.264
But I felt that he belongs there, just as Ralph Reed belongs there, and Pat Robertson belongs there.

35:59.284 --> 36:00.185
And Mrs. Huffington.

36:00.205 --> 36:01.346
And Mrs. Huffington.

36:01.386 --> 36:02.207
Twice, by the way.

36:02.227 --> 36:03.189
I think they all are.

36:03.609 --> 36:05.672
I've had lunch with her.

36:05.712 --> 36:06.292
Well, years ago.

36:06.372 --> 36:12.420
I interviewed her on the Maria Callas book, which was terrible.

36:12.839 --> 36:18.545
See, I tried to read a thing called The Third Instinct or The Fourth Instinct.

36:19.066 --> 36:23.471
My God, is that a piece of New Age nonsense.

36:23.751 --> 36:24.732
I mean, it's rock bottom.

36:24.972 --> 36:26.214
She's a dangerous woman.

36:26.234 --> 36:27.335
Oh, she's an awful woman.

36:27.395 --> 36:29.858
She's ruthless, actually.

36:29.878 --> 36:32.761
Well, I'm sure she would like to do me an old turn after this book.

36:34.163 --> 36:36.866
You're never going to let her representing her now, too.

36:36.886 --> 36:39.669
I don't know if you know that, too.

36:40.129 --> 36:41.631
That's absolutely true, yeah.

36:42.826 --> 36:45.891
Glenn and Lynn are representing Mrs. Huxchips.

36:45.911 --> 36:46.472
Oh, yes.

36:46.492 --> 36:48.595
This is hilarious.

36:48.615 --> 37:01.476
But, of course, you know, even though they are lovely people, even though they are lovely people and wonderful agents, and I regard them as family, as my son has done, this book is dedicated to them, as you probably saw.

37:03.820 --> 37:04.902
Glenn and Lynn are

37:05.219 --> 37:12.830
We long since agreed, my wife and I, on the one hand, and Glenn and Len and Len, and though we all love one another, we agree that we would never discuss politics again.

37:13.671 --> 37:18.278
Glenn and Len are about as right-wing as you can be without being fascist.

37:18.598 --> 37:29.274
Well, this is all off the record between us, but when the Gingrich book came out, I'm probably one of the few journalists in America who declined an opportunity to interview him.

37:29.294 --> 37:32.138
I said, no, I'm not going to give this man ink, free ink.

37:32.438 --> 37:34.961
He is a very evil man.

37:35.061 --> 37:36.403
You know, I can go so far.

37:36.563 --> 37:40.328
He, Ralph Reed, and Pat Robinson are really a triple-headed beast.

37:40.589 --> 37:46.076
I mean, if there is Satan in the United States now, to be serious for a moment, it is those three.

37:46.096 --> 37:47.157
That's profound evil.

37:47.758 --> 37:51.062
It outrages me more than wearing that ex-libris tie.

37:51.082 --> 37:51.803
Yes, yes.

37:51.923 --> 37:53.946
But I have that same tie.

37:54.407 --> 37:55.208
No, no, no, no.

37:55.268 --> 38:00.775
But I really felt they had to be in the book because, you know...

38:02.695 --> 38:05.559
And you can't worry about who your agent represents.

38:05.679 --> 38:07.041
No!

38:07.061 --> 38:08.363
Who the hell is going to worry about that?

38:08.444 --> 38:08.844
That's right.

38:08.864 --> 38:12.810
Well, I must say that now they've gone too far, and they didn't tell me.

38:12.870 --> 38:13.711
How interesting.

38:14.593 --> 38:16.115
Are they on the hospital?

38:16.155 --> 38:17.717
Please don't tell them I told you.

38:17.818 --> 38:22.605
And they're also representing her sister, who's trying to do a children's book.

38:22.625 --> 38:23.947
Oh, my God.

38:23.967 --> 38:26.110
And what book of Ariana's are they representing?

38:26.390 --> 38:26.971
I don't know.

38:27.272 --> 38:27.572
I have no idea.

38:34.285 --> 38:37.450
They've got every right winger in the country.

38:38.111 --> 38:39.233
And then they've got you and me.

38:40.295 --> 38:42.579
We are the illiberal Democrats.

38:43.601 --> 38:47.788
They really have, I mean, they have worse garbage than that, you know.

38:47.848 --> 38:50.152
Worse garbage than even Gingrich and Huffington.

38:50.653 --> 38:59.247
They've got this monster, David Brock, who's winging out a book, which they're touting, called The Seduction of Hillary Romance.

39:00.661 --> 39:02.924
And he's the one who did the Anita Carol Bush thing.

39:02.944 --> 39:03.665
He is.

39:03.725 --> 39:04.606
He is.

39:05.947 --> 39:07.029
Well, he's a hit man.

39:07.449 --> 39:08.450
He's a hit man.

39:09.051 --> 39:09.772
He's vicious.

39:09.832 --> 39:10.573
He's crazy.

39:10.613 --> 39:12.816
And they encourage him.

39:14.458 --> 39:15.479
What can we do?

39:15.539 --> 39:19.404
Glenn and Lynn are very good agents.

39:21.606 --> 39:23.749
Glenn has more literary sensibility.

39:24.252 --> 39:26.935
than any so-called literary agent in the world today.

39:26.955 --> 39:28.856
I mean, he suggested Shep Ruhlin's book.

39:29.037 --> 39:31.259
I mean, he actually came up with it.

39:31.599 --> 39:40.227
Glenn has a profound mind, has a vast love and knowledge of 17th century literature and poetry in general.

39:41.348 --> 39:45.392
Uh, Lynn is a profoundly cultured person.

39:47.774 --> 39:50.597
What?

39:50.617 --> 39:51.558
It's interesting, that kind of politics.

39:51.578 --> 39:54.040
They have no social compassion whatsoever.

39:54.458 --> 39:56.722
I mean, they're out of the University of Chicago.

39:56.742 --> 39:59.527
Yeah, they have no social compassion whatsoever.

40:00.188 --> 40:02.833
They don't care about the insult to the ninjas.

40:02.873 --> 40:04.636
They don't care about the downtrodden.

40:05.698 --> 40:13.572
They are, uh... Well, anyway, we love them dearly, and... They are lovely people.

40:13.592 --> 40:16.197
They're wonderful, and they certainly stuck by me in my moment.

40:16.615 --> 40:22.001
They are lovely people, and they are the best possible literary agents.

40:22.021 --> 40:22.922
They are very loyal.

40:23.182 --> 40:25.424
And they understand the books that you read?

40:25.705 --> 40:31.291
And I am, in all questions of my work, absolutely loyal to them.

40:31.891 --> 40:42.623
But that doesn't mean that I, for one moment, condone their ghastly politics, and I will certainly make fun of them on the score of Arianna Huffington, and I won't tell them who tells me.

40:43.126 --> 40:43.987
I won't tell him.

40:44.268 --> 40:47.172
I'll just say, the rumor mill tells me, kids.

40:47.432 --> 40:48.494
They're going to know for sure.

40:48.874 --> 40:50.096
No, I won't do it immediately.

40:50.196 --> 40:52.980
I told him I was talking to him yesterday.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.983
I told him I was going to see you.

40:55.724 --> 40:56.565
It doesn't matter.

40:56.726 --> 40:57.927
What's there to be ashamed of?

40:58.048 --> 40:59.930
No, no, no, no, no.

41:00.211 --> 41:01.052
They don't take a living.

41:01.152 --> 41:02.374
That's right.

41:02.394 --> 41:03.275
It's so funny.

41:05.058 --> 41:05.679
Let's go back.

41:05.779 --> 41:06.460
Let's go back.

41:07.201 --> 41:09.164
We started, you had this stuff.

41:10.446 --> 41:12.829
You told me the first time we spoke that

41:13.248 --> 41:19.456
One reason you're going to keep teaching in this department of one... Fear of madness.

41:19.476 --> 41:20.277
Fear of madness.

41:21.119 --> 41:23.161
Fear of isolation, fear, you know.

41:23.422 --> 41:28.649
But I think you also feel that after me, who's... Oh, there's nothing.

41:29.470 --> 41:38.201
I mean, the older generation here has now entirely retired, and they were a very distinguished group from the teaching of literature.

41:38.862 --> 41:42.327
The survivors are myself and my old friend, the poet John Hollander.

41:43.792 --> 41:48.420
who's a geezer a year older than myself, 67 to my 66.

41:50.583 --> 41:56.894
There are some good younger people here, including my former students, David Bromwich and Leslie Brisbane.

41:56.914 --> 42:01.361
But I don't really see my replacement on the horizon.

42:02.002 --> 42:04.746
Not even here, but anywhere, perhaps.

42:04.766 --> 42:05.167
Anywhere.

42:05.648 --> 42:06.930
And therefore...

42:08.682 --> 42:10.905
That's another reason to go on teaching.

42:10.925 --> 42:13.188
It may sound like arrogance, but I don't think it's arrogance.

42:13.208 --> 42:20.639
I'm a dinosaur, and the lion will be extinct after me.

42:22.281 --> 42:22.442
Okay.

42:22.782 --> 42:31.234
What were your reactions when you heard, was it last year, that you can now get a degree in English literature at Georgetown University?

42:31.534 --> 42:31.715
Oh, no.

42:31.735 --> 42:31.875
Oh, no.

42:31.895 --> 42:33.998
You're not being required to study Shakespeare.

42:34.158 --> 42:35.921
My dear Nicholas.

42:35.941 --> 42:36.141
Nicholas.

42:37.083 --> 42:48.119
You can get a degree in English literature, I believe, anywhere in the world today, both English-speaking and non-English-speaking, almost anywhere.

42:48.720 --> 42:56.090
There'd be a few exceptions, like Yale, and I guess still Harvard, though I don't know that for a fact, and maybe Notre Dame.

42:56.691 --> 43:01.077
There are a few conservative universities around, but there aren't many, relatively conservative.

43:01.518 --> 43:04.041
Not that Harvard is very conservative anymore.

43:04.061 --> 43:06.685
But, my God...

43:09.803 --> 43:12.687
There are people now who get doctorates in English literature.

43:13.449 --> 43:14.690
Who have ever studied Shakespeare.

43:14.710 --> 43:24.385
Who have read Lacan, Derrida, Foucault, Lyotard, all of this garbage.

43:24.405 --> 43:38.967
Know it by heart, backwards, and poets, Lady Strauss, what you will, and have never read Shakespeare, have never read John Milton, have never read Geoffrey Chaucer, have never read Edmund Spencer.

43:39.402 --> 43:40.724
I've never read Wordsworth.

43:40.844 --> 43:43.287
I've literally never read the greatest poets in the language.

43:43.347 --> 43:46.210
That's just the way things are.

43:47.372 --> 43:50.095
It shouldn't be called English Literature anymore.

43:50.115 --> 43:51.497
It shouldn't be called Literature.

43:51.517 --> 43:54.560
These are, in fact, what they're beginning to call themselves.

43:54.621 --> 43:57.064
These are departments of cultural studies.

43:59.306 --> 44:04.853
And as I kept saying until I am blue in the face, so there's no point in saying it anymore, the only way...

44:05.491 --> 44:31.819
that the serious study of literature is going to survive anywhere in the world, will be if eventually these rascals and all the deans who support them and all the journalists outside who support them led us on the model of what we now call classics departments, a little group of four or five professors who teach Greek and Latin literature, on the model of that, let's have very small departments of...

44:32.187 --> 44:36.851
literature, and huge service departments of cultural studies.

44:37.772 --> 44:46.080
So, you know, they can teach theme parks and Batman comics and rock music and hip-hop and all this stuff.

44:46.881 --> 44:59.073
And let there be, at every major university or college, let there be three or four or five men and women who will teach Chaucer and Shakespeare and Milton and Spencer.

44:59.773 --> 45:00.574
But it's not going to happen.

45:01.297 --> 45:02.718
They wouldn't dream of allowing it.

45:03.659 --> 45:08.764
I mean, are people just not moved by literature anymore?

45:08.784 --> 45:09.885
Well, I don't think that's true.

45:10.886 --> 45:16.852
I think that it's moved outside the academy, just as it's moved outside the journalistic world.

45:16.872 --> 45:18.694
I think there are a lot of people out there.

45:18.714 --> 45:21.096
These are the people who write menards.

45:21.116 --> 45:23.659
These are the people who bought and read the Western canon.

45:23.679 --> 45:28.063
I guess that's my puzzle.

45:28.837 --> 45:35.748
But I'm getting back to an early thing we were talking about, Nick, about why I'm so uneasy about this book.

45:36.289 --> 45:42.859
At the Western Canon, I knew I was going to take it on the chin from all sides, right and left, but that was great.

45:42.999 --> 45:43.920
And that was fun.

45:43.941 --> 45:44.461
Yeah.

45:44.582 --> 45:50.531
I also knew that I knew what I was doing.

45:51.312 --> 45:55.198
That is to say, I am a lifelong student of literature.

45:59.127 --> 46:06.439
Yale.

46:06.459 --> 46:08.261
I knew the genre that I was working in.

46:09.263 --> 46:26.991
But the other side of me, call it the religious or the spiritual or Gnostic side, which is not really necessarily a separate side, but just a different aspect of it, and which has been writing for a long time and writing books for a long time also, that's a more

46:28.473 --> 46:29.454
What is one to say?

46:29.514 --> 46:30.595
Spectative thing.

46:30.615 --> 46:32.537
That's something more of surmise.

46:33.798 --> 46:37.201
I just don't know.

46:37.221 --> 46:56.758
I don't know whether this book, Omens of Millennium, will have the fate of what I thought was a very fine book, the one called The American Religion, which just about nobody read, or whether it will have a fate more like that of The Book of J.,

46:57.582 --> 46:59.524
and the Western Canon.

46:59.604 --> 47:00.625
I just have no idea.

47:03.028 --> 47:06.271
That's what I mean also by saying that the book hasn't got a genre, I mean.

47:07.172 --> 47:08.533
Vaporates.

47:08.553 --> 47:08.833
What?

47:08.934 --> 47:11.136
Vaporates to a degree.

47:11.276 --> 47:12.918
I will acknowledge that.

47:12.938 --> 47:21.847
I think when you say it doesn't have a genre, I think that if people don't really know where to, at least critics are accustomed to pigeonholing things.

47:22.247 --> 47:25.210
It's a religious, it's a personal religious book.

47:27.367 --> 47:30.050
of a rather unorthodox view of religion.

47:32.672 --> 47:40.099
But it goes over some very strange bodies of material, ancient and modern, and tries to tie it together.

47:40.119 --> 47:44.423
I just don't know what they're going to make of it.

47:45.544 --> 47:52.371
There's a guy, Glenn read it to me over the phone last Sunday in the Baltimore Sun.

47:53.452 --> 47:56.715
There was a piece by a guy named, gee, what's his name?

47:57.691 --> 48:00.975
I don't think I'd heard of him before, and the name has slipped me now.

48:01.796 --> 48:03.218
But he was very intelligent.

48:03.278 --> 48:06.343
He saw exactly what the book was doing and why it was doing it.

48:06.423 --> 48:12.291
So maybe, maybe, I don't know, maybe there will be a certain number of reviewers who will be able to figure it out.

48:16.716 --> 48:18.599
There was a conference at Trinity College.

48:18.659 --> 48:21.623
I didn't go to it, but it was a conference of

48:22.143 --> 48:51.323
women literary of course this is one of the five groups that you write about in the western and of course they've basically agreed now that Sarah I mean they're really trying to find writers I know I know I mean they're going through the stage of beatification now I know and then of course when you achieve sainthood then I guess because they have done this that you are automatically enlisted in the roles of the canon

48:51.708 --> 49:01.339
with a capital C. And, I mean, just because somebody says this is part of the canon, it doesn't make it part of the canon.

49:01.359 --> 49:07.906
I mean, maybe I'm talking very stupidly here, but I guess I'm looking for a comment from you on this.

49:08.947 --> 49:11.610
And I know we're revisiting territory.

49:11.710 --> 49:16.095
Well, you know, what can one do?

49:18.455 --> 49:32.294
I mean, does literature have to be relevant in a social... I'd like to get rid of the term feminist because the legitimate use of feminist is social, political, economic.

49:34.597 --> 49:39.123
Feminist literary critics, they're not feminist, and they're not literary, and they're not critics.

49:40.085 --> 49:45.632
It's like Freudian literary criticism, which is neither Freudian, nor literary, nor criticism.

49:46.033 --> 49:47.635
Feminist literary criticism, it's not feminist.

49:54.162 --> 49:58.406
There's someone who's out there working for Planned Parenthood.

49:59.026 --> 50:02.409
There's someone who's out there agitating for equal treatment for women.

50:02.469 --> 50:08.855
There's someone who's out there fighting for a woman's right to choose and so on.

50:10.076 --> 50:15.661
There's people out there trying to do something about domestic violence and abuse of women.

50:17.382 --> 50:24.068
The feminists in the academy are just part of a group, part of a sort of power grab

50:24.402 --> 50:27.465
You know, they're the ginger and power freaks, as I call them.

50:29.668 --> 50:39.478
They have no relation to so-called, I mean, they're not concerned with poor women or downtrodden women or women who are being abused and so on.

50:39.558 --> 50:44.323
They're just concerned with the bureaucrats.

50:44.744 --> 50:47.367
They're careerists.

50:47.467 --> 50:51.591
They're commissars who happen to be human females, but

50:52.077 --> 50:54.541
A lot of them are my former students.

50:54.681 --> 51:02.392
And who teach literature institutions, and so therefore... And a great deal, in fact, of what calls itself feminist literary criticism started as a reaction against me.

51:03.674 --> 51:11.565
A great deal of it comes out of the anxiety of influence, which they then denounce as, well, this is a male sexist sort of thing, etc., and then they go on from there.

51:12.326 --> 51:15.791
I attended this conference in Boston over the weekend just for a couple of days.

51:16.312 --> 51:20.818
Those are the fellows and girls who are trying to fight back.

51:21.490 --> 51:24.993
who've invited me to join their ranks, but I've replied, well, I have sympathy.

51:25.013 --> 51:26.835
Your name was mentioned repeatedly.

51:26.855 --> 51:28.536
I said, I have some sympathy with you.

51:28.636 --> 51:31.539
Indeed, the president is a very close friend, Roger Shattuck.

51:31.559 --> 51:33.100
I haven't talked to Roger like that.

51:33.120 --> 51:36.463
Roger is a terrific human being, and I'm very fond of him.

51:37.204 --> 51:39.586
And Roger keeps saying, Harold, you have to join.

51:39.666 --> 51:41.087
And I keep saying, no, no, no.

51:41.348 --> 51:45.411
Remember, my motto is the Marxist one, the true Marx, Brad Shope.

51:45.431 --> 51:48.294
I wouldn't be a member of any club that would have leave for a member.

51:48.574 --> 51:50.856
I don't want to.

51:51.680 --> 51:53.402
I mean, I see what they're trying to do.

51:54.363 --> 51:57.386
Well, at the members' meeting, it was very interesting.

51:58.527 --> 52:08.738
A good number, and there was no consensus reach, but a good number of these members want themselves to become more politically active and to make demands at the university.

52:08.758 --> 52:11.240
And, you know, an equal member shouted them down.

52:11.260 --> 52:13.142
I think that's self-defeating, don't you think?

52:13.843 --> 52:18.948
If they become to fight the MLA and all these others... You can't fight the MLA.

52:19.129 --> 52:20.590
It's a big, bloated beast.

52:20.873 --> 52:21.934
You know what it really is now?

52:22.535 --> 52:24.017
But I'd love you to put this in the column.

52:24.437 --> 52:28.442
The MLA, even though most of its members would get furious at me for saying this.

52:28.843 --> 52:29.544
I put it in my book.

52:30.104 --> 52:31.026
Yeah, put it in my book.

52:31.046 --> 52:32.027
Put it anywhere you want to.

52:32.527 --> 52:34.089
Put it in both, if you want to.

52:35.131 --> 52:35.792
Either or both.

52:36.613 --> 52:46.204
The MLA, even though they would see themselves as politically opposed to the Christian coalition, they have everything in common with the Christian coalition.

52:46.224 --> 52:46.465
That's good.

52:46.485 --> 52:49.108
They're that kind of a mass pressure group.

52:50.641 --> 52:54.105
They're a very bad business, indeed.

52:55.166 --> 52:57.409
They have no relation to literary values.

52:57.429 --> 52:58.330
How did that happen?

52:58.490 --> 53:00.572
That was a pretty good group once upon a time.

53:00.893 --> 53:04.016
My dear, I was prophetic in this, too.

53:04.136 --> 53:15.349
I left the Yale English Department in 1976 when I got the Yale Corporation to appoint me professor of absolutely nothing, you know, studying professor of humanities without colleagues.

53:16.173 --> 53:24.323
When I did, I also wrote a letter of resignation to the Modern Language Association and another one to the English Institute, in which I blasted both.

53:24.363 --> 53:26.366
And that was 20 years ago, 1976.

53:26.386 --> 53:29.429
And I said, you're not studying literature anymore.

53:29.610 --> 53:31.071
You're just agitating, you know.

53:31.812 --> 53:35.317
This has become a purely political kind of an operation.

53:35.337 --> 53:36.638
You're fighting culture wars.

53:38.180 --> 53:43.767
And you're destroying aesthetic and humane and scholarly and cognitive and intellectuals.

53:44.455 --> 53:47.078
values, and I think that's absolutely true.

53:48.220 --> 53:55.148
I call them parallel to the Christian coalition because the Christian coalition has nothing to do with Christianity.

53:55.889 --> 54:05.861
It has everything to do with their upper bourgeois status and their wish to hold on to it and to impose their values on everybody else, which are not Christian values or Christian morals at all.

54:06.742 --> 54:14.091
In the same way, the MOA pretend to stand, at least they used to pretend to stand for aesthetic values

54:14.847 --> 54:20.696
values and aesthetic interests, but of course they don't even believe in that anymore, and they now make the aesthetic a curse word.

54:21.538 --> 54:23.661
You know, there are no aesthetic values for that.

54:23.681 --> 54:36.501
I remember during—when the Soviet Union was still the Soviet Union, and interviewing a number of Russian writers, and we were talking, and I remember the mandate then was you had to write under a

54:36.937 --> 55:00.666
of course what you got was lousy literature yeah and what you get is lousy criticism out of these people it's not literary but i mean well my point is with and of course these people argue that for literature to be literature it has to be relevant and and relevant to what i mean and that and you can see where i'm going with this question and i wonder if you could

55:01.203 --> 55:05.407
Well, I'm going to turn it on the other side.

55:05.427 --> 55:08.029
I think we're approaching a point I really want to get.

55:08.190 --> 55:10.031
No, there's a few more minutes to this side.

55:10.051 --> 55:11.032
Go ahead.

55:11.052 --> 55:12.794
Can I shoot a couple of pictures, by the way?

55:12.894 --> 55:13.114
No, no, no.

55:13.134 --> 55:15.336
I want to break in a moment anyway to pop to the bathroom.

55:15.477 --> 55:17.899
This paper is a light-colored photograph.

55:17.919 --> 55:18.339
Here's this.

55:18.620 --> 55:20.101
Let me go on for a moment.

55:23.044 --> 55:29.590
What this new book of mine has in common with the Western canon, the sense in which it really is a kind of more of a sequel to the Western canon,

55:30.177 --> 55:57.062
and to say the American religion of the Book of J in my recent work, is that what ties together what I'm talking about in this elements of Millennium book and what I was talking about in the Western canon is that aesthetic values and spiritual values, even if they're not necessarily exactly the same, one thing is overwhelmingly uncommon between them.

55:57.742 --> 55:59.644
It is a question of individuality.

56:00.417 --> 56:03.861
It is a question of a solitary reader.

56:04.642 --> 56:08.227
It is a question of a solitary meditator.

56:08.387 --> 56:12.873
It is a question of the solitary and individual self.

56:13.874 --> 56:22.505
And that, of course, is what these people deny in their emphasis on what they think is the communal.

56:25.028 --> 56:30.055
But what can them do?

56:30.075 --> 56:30.255
Let's go.

56:30.505 --> 56:32.669
Did you say you were going to take a little break?

56:33.210 --> 56:35.013
Yeah, I'll take a break in a moment, don't you?

56:35.114 --> 56:39.161
I'm going to just, when you come back.

56:39.602 --> 56:39.903
Sure.

56:39.963 --> 56:43.589
I was just thinking about all this, and you'll want to turn this around anyway.

56:44.451 --> 56:45.593
I'll be right back.

56:46.896 --> 56:49.240
You don't mind covering these areas, I hope.
