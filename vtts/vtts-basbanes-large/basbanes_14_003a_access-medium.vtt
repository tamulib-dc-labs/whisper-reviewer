WEBVTT

00:02.107 --> 00:03.790
Talking to Monsieur Pierre.

00:04.611 --> 00:08.578
You want to know about books?

00:08.638 --> 00:10.461
You want me to show you one or two books?

00:10.481 --> 00:12.004
Oh, I'd love to see some books, yes.

00:13.446 --> 00:14.168
No, don't worry.

00:14.268 --> 00:15.169
They won't go third.

00:16.912 --> 00:22.342
We'll ask you questions while I'm taking one or two books out.

00:22.362 --> 00:23.424
The cognac is wonderful.

00:24.005 --> 00:25.687
It's good, huh?

00:25.707 --> 00:26.629
And you would like it.

00:33.562 --> 00:40.510
What am I going to show you?

00:40.550 --> 00:44.936
There's a few of my books here.

00:49.962 --> 00:53.606
The book is just a fun like that, just to see.

00:54.487 --> 01:02.657
So that is a nice first edition of Goya's Capitals in the Spanish original binding.

01:03.093 --> 01:05.496
Very, very nice.

01:06.237 --> 01:09.021
Just very fine printing.

01:09.061 --> 01:11.585
Very beautiful.

01:11.665 --> 01:13.467
And the copy.

01:13.968 --> 01:19.736
And what is the year around this?

01:19.756 --> 01:26.785
1799 or 1801, I don't remember.

01:26.945 --> 01:32.593
Around 1800, I think 1799.

01:33.434 --> 01:35.476
Is this a favorite book of yours?

01:35.857 --> 01:38.800
No, I have quite a few favorite books.

01:38.820 --> 01:40.622
A favorite, though, I mean.

01:40.702 --> 01:44.125
No, it's just my book, just to show you.

01:44.145 --> 01:44.826
Look at random.

01:45.487 --> 01:46.888
This is an amusing book.

01:48.230 --> 01:56.478
It's the first edition of Polyphilo, Hypnerturutomakias.

01:57.339 --> 02:01.804
It's one of the very nice copies you can find in pure contemporary binding.

02:02.088 --> 02:15.723
It has belonged to Laroš Pukovic, who is one of our great writers, just like Locke or something like that, in the Aldean contemporary binding and in very perfect condition, as you can see.

02:15.743 --> 02:19.247
This book is more than 500 years old, right?

02:19.508 --> 02:20.849
Yes, it's 1499.

02:21.310 --> 02:22.111
Look at the paper.

02:22.131 --> 02:25.134
1499, the illustration is beautiful.

02:25.254 --> 02:26.956
It's one of the great books in my world.

02:27.036 --> 02:28.618
Look at the condition of it.

02:29.223 --> 02:31.887
Well, it has to be that condition otherwise it's not amusing.

02:33.309 --> 02:33.670
Okay.

02:34.030 --> 02:35.132
It's not amusing, you say.

02:35.532 --> 02:39.318
Well, it should be amusing, yes.

02:39.338 --> 02:42.002
Condition is, of course, essential.

02:42.022 --> 02:43.183
Essential.

02:43.203 --> 02:44.946
Condition from north, everything.

02:47.510 --> 02:56.563
In your essay, and I've got my tape on now, so while we're talking, you use some descriptions of books I've never seen before, like a Lambda copy.

02:56.948 --> 02:58.129
A choice card.

02:58.149 --> 02:58.990
These are new words.

02:59.992 --> 03:07.841
In your essay for the book collector, you used descriptions that I've never seen used before, like a lambda card.

03:08.221 --> 03:11.185
Well, that's my question.

03:11.245 --> 03:13.127
Four categories, yes.

03:13.308 --> 03:15.190
I'm setting these up.

03:16.772 --> 03:17.593
I've never seen those.

03:17.753 --> 03:21.738
I wish that essay had been in existence while I was writing my book.

03:22.238 --> 03:25.843
They're just my fantasy.

03:25.923 --> 03:26.263
Okay.

03:26.699 --> 03:29.283
Go ahead, Hindu book.

03:29.303 --> 03:30.725
Now, what would you like to know?

03:31.186 --> 03:34.070
Well, why don't we just have a conversation, if that's okay with you?

03:34.330 --> 03:35.692
Why don't we have a conversation?

03:35.732 --> 03:36.333
Yeah, go ahead.

03:36.774 --> 03:38.196
And why don't we talk about you?

03:38.917 --> 03:44.566
Let's have a very easy entry into the conversation.

03:44.586 --> 03:49.513
You do originate some phrases in this essay called a lambda book, a choice book.

03:50.354 --> 03:53.118
I guess another one is a monumental book that you use.

03:54.020 --> 03:56.183
Well, I can't decide those four categories.

03:56.737 --> 04:12.855
And I thought about that for some time, because the ocean of books, the immense ocean of books, which you cannot gather, you cannot measure, you cannot understand.

04:12.875 --> 04:20.443
And then somehow you collect books, why, who, how, for how much, et cetera.

04:20.523 --> 04:24.988
So I tried to establish those four categories,

04:25.492 --> 04:53.406
one or two, they mingle together, but I think that, if I call all the books which have been written, which are millions, billions, of course, written, published, etc., lambda books, all the books, no books, no special books, and then amongst these, above these, excuse me, above these, of course, you hear what I call the monumental books, which are

04:54.145 --> 05:00.432
The very great books of the world, the Book of Kells or things like that, which are monuments.

05:01.233 --> 05:22.397
But you can find a monument in, I mean, you can, and we can, every one of us can buy a monumental book someday, because they don't need to cost, well, normally a monumental book like the Book of Kells would be worth some 30 million pounds or 20 million pounds.

05:23.103 --> 05:24.424
a little more probably.

05:24.444 --> 05:32.573
Then you can have for, let's say, one million or two million pounds, which is something I can't afford.

05:32.593 --> 05:44.064
I don't know if you can, but Mr. Mellon can certainly afford, for which amount you can get a very, very beautiful apocalyptus of the 13th century or something like that.

05:44.985 --> 05:49.009
You can have a very, very fine item.

05:51.790 --> 06:04.761
which enter in the category of monumental books because they are parallel to nothing and they are quite exceptional.

06:05.282 --> 06:10.846
They are unique, of course, and unique in their kind and unique in themselves.

06:11.647 --> 06:20.835
And then you have what people, appreciation throughout the centuries,

06:21.541 --> 06:36.875
has chosen among the lambda books, has perceived among the lambda books, among all the broad ocean of books, as some sort of, let's say, high spot.

06:37.996 --> 06:41.660
I don't like this word very much, but there's five high spots.

06:41.680 --> 06:50.468
It says large high spots or small high spots, which mark something, which signifies something,

06:51.055 --> 06:59.763
And those, be they worth, let's say, 100,000 pounds or five pounds, they are significant books.

07:00.703 --> 07:04.787
I mean, what would be a five-pound significant book?

07:05.608 --> 07:14.796
Well, let's say the first edition of Kafka's Castle in German is worth about, I don't know, today, what's it?

07:15.556 --> 07:18.639
No, not five pounds, but 20 pounds.

07:18.679 --> 07:19.780
20 pounds.

07:19.996 --> 07:23.821
It's obviously a significant book, not very important.

07:24.141 --> 07:24.501
All right.

07:24.742 --> 07:33.572
Well, if this had an inscription to, let's say, Thomas Mann, for instance, if it were possible, the date would allow it.

07:34.213 --> 07:39.039
With a very chosen book, it would be at the same time a significant date, chosen book, that's all.

07:39.279 --> 07:40.841
To Max Bride, for instance.

07:40.861 --> 07:41.081
Excuse me?

07:41.322 --> 07:43.524
To Max Bride would even be more interesting.

07:44.385 --> 07:46.307
Definitely, much more.

07:46.327 --> 07:48.450
But if you find a 13th edition,

07:48.802 --> 07:58.874
on Mr. Kafka's castle, which is worth nothing, and it would be inscribed to the same throat, it still would be not a significant book, but a chosen book.

07:58.894 --> 08:00.556
A chosen book.

08:00.576 --> 08:00.656
Yes.

08:00.956 --> 08:04.601
So I have thought a great deal about that.

08:04.641 --> 08:14.252
I have spoken with my dear friend Felix Dorjans, whom I like very much, Roger Stoddart and Nicholas Bach, of course, and they

08:14.553 --> 08:18.537
from how reluctantly they have somehow agreed to my category.

08:18.657 --> 08:19.358
Reluctantly?

08:21.360 --> 08:22.521
Well, because it was novel.

08:22.641 --> 08:24.042
I mean, it was quite novel.

08:24.162 --> 08:25.884
Nobody had ever thought of that.

08:25.944 --> 08:27.706
Nobody had distinguished those categories.

08:28.126 --> 08:29.808
And I think they mean something.

08:32.570 --> 08:39.297
But this emerges out of a great, of a lifetime, a lifetime passion for books.

08:39.857 --> 08:43.581
It's not a question of passion, it's not a question of passion, just a question of

08:43.763 --> 08:46.807
of looking at books, of thinking about the mass of books.

08:47.448 --> 08:49.511
The mass of books, you say?

08:49.531 --> 08:51.814
Well, the mass of books, yes.

08:51.834 --> 08:54.017
The whole mess, or mass, or whatever you want.

08:54.458 --> 09:01.668
I mean, you have to think out, well, you see, you have six billion people.

09:02.089 --> 09:08.117
Well, you have to think that there are 1,200 million Chinese, and then there are 250.

09:08.350 --> 09:12.334
eighty-five million Americans, and then there are, well, you distinguish them.

09:12.775 --> 09:16.418
So you can sort them out, and you can think of them.

09:16.799 --> 09:20.382
Among the Americans, you have a Republican, a Democrat, or whatever.

09:20.643 --> 09:26.609
I mean, you can make very, very, very inhuman beings, of course, and then you have men and women.

09:27.009 --> 09:29.031
Women first, of course, and then men.

09:29.452 --> 09:32.114
And then you can make categories like that.

09:32.354 --> 09:37.800
So I thought that it would be interesting once in a while to make sort of categories of books.

09:38.135 --> 09:39.377
And that I maintain.

09:39.817 --> 09:41.279
I think it's very logical.

09:41.379 --> 09:43.502
I mean, I can see no objective.

09:44.123 --> 10:02.308
I have tried to hear and people have tried to express, but they didn't, they cannot, I don't think it's contradictable because I use very, very broad and very, very, very simple, very broad, very elementary notions.

10:02.728 --> 10:04.591
I mean, it's not sophisticated at all.

10:05.011 --> 10:06.994
I mean, lambda books, there are all the books

10:07.244 --> 10:08.826
All the books you don't choose.

10:08.846 --> 10:11.370
And then you have monumental books that are obvious.

10:11.430 --> 10:18.781
I mean, the Book of Scales or any great Bible which has belonged to a king or a circle is celebrated.

10:19.281 --> 10:21.985
At the same time, beautiful and renowned, etc.

10:22.266 --> 10:23.748
It's a monument you can't do.

10:23.988 --> 10:27.854
And you can't, I mean, the book I showed you is a very nice book.

10:27.874 --> 10:29.817
That's a significant and chosen book.

10:30.598 --> 10:31.199
See?

10:31.219 --> 10:31.559
Both.

10:32.200 --> 10:34.023
The Goya is also a significant book.

10:34.043 --> 10:34.804
It's one of the...

10:34.936 --> 10:36.338
What's a significant book?

10:36.378 --> 10:39.463
It's a book which is a landmark.

10:40.244 --> 10:48.997
It's a landmark which shows something which has probably always been respected from its very birth.

10:49.759 --> 10:52.082
That's one of the characteristics of significant books.

10:52.803 --> 10:53.664
It's very rare.

10:53.685 --> 10:55.247
It's very rare.

10:55.367 --> 11:03.880
Well, sometimes you see that Gilbert's Magnet, for instance, it's a book which has been respected and sought for for many centuries.

11:04.467 --> 11:26.849
And, well, in Copernicus's first edition, I mean, it has always been considered a very precious, important, whatever word you use, precious, important, valuable, significant, appealing to the mind, moving to the heart, anything.

11:26.869 --> 11:34.457
I mean, it's a book which, and the important thing about the Lambda book is that you don't know anything about them that

11:34.690 --> 12:03.094
the way to push aside the massive billions of books which exist, whereas the significant books, they are very, very, it's a very strained list, I'm explaining who made those lists, but you can add every year or every month, you can choose hundred other books which will be worth the term significant, and then you can find, every one of us can find one book which is significant, which is not

12:03.563 --> 12:19.299
Perceived as that, generally, and from when it's taken into a great collection, be it heaven or more, or any distinguished collection, distinguished in common, well, it becomes a significant book.

12:19.419 --> 12:29.890
When two, three, five people of repute and honest claim that it is interesting, be it a 12-pound book or a million-pound book, the same.

12:29.910 --> 12:31.191
I mean, no difference.

12:31.424 --> 12:34.528
The thing is, it has its certain position.

12:34.928 --> 12:36.930
It is somehow unavoidable.

12:37.631 --> 12:57.635
Marx, it's a landmark, exactly, be it because it's the first traditional, be it because it's the first on the stage, because it's the most beautiful among the stations, because it's a high spot in science, et cetera, marks a certain distance of invention or so.

12:57.755 --> 12:59.777
So you've been involved with books, I think,

13:00.787 --> 13:03.610
since the age of like 11, is this correct?

13:03.630 --> 13:04.191
13.

13:04.211 --> 13:05.132
13.

13:05.833 --> 13:09.977
And could you tell me, so you haven't lost any of your enthusiasm.

13:10.458 --> 13:10.938
Oh, no.

13:11.279 --> 13:12.560
Oh, no, sir.

13:12.580 --> 13:30.220
Every day, every day, I read two, five, ten catalogs, and I look at, every day I look at, during my bloody life, I have looked at, but every day I have looked between 10 and 2,000 books the same day.

13:30.301 --> 13:31.062
2,000.

13:31.482 --> 13:34.225
There are days when you have actually looked at 2,000 books.

13:34.245 --> 13:34.946
There are days.

13:35.446 --> 13:36.688
Oh, yes, days, yes, of course.

13:36.708 --> 13:37.829
Where you've looked at 2,000 books.

13:37.909 --> 13:38.169
Yes.

13:39.471 --> 13:40.972
Do your hands tell you anything?

13:41.213 --> 13:42.094
Or is it the eye?

13:42.234 --> 13:44.856
Can you tell about a book just by holding it?

13:44.876 --> 13:48.961
What about, no, it's always, it's first a question of the eye.

13:49.962 --> 13:50.943
The eye knows everything.

13:52.625 --> 13:59.532
And, you see, when I come into a room, not a made-up room, but a

13:59.900 --> 14:02.764
an attic room, I know exactly what there is.

14:03.585 --> 14:13.059
And there are very, very few surprises, very few mistakes, always mistakes, very few surprises.

14:13.339 --> 14:17.165
I mean, I know exactly what the contents are, how they are, if it's on thoughts.

14:17.185 --> 14:27.780
I mean, if it can remain like that since, let's say, 30 or 200, better, 200 years, then I have an apprehension of the whole system of books.

14:28.317 --> 14:30.920
But then I have to go through every one of the books.

14:30.940 --> 14:38.267
And then, of course, I discover some things to wonder about, some disappointing points, etc.

14:38.627 --> 14:44.813
But there are days, yes, there are days where I have handled probably more than 2,000 books a day.

14:45.393 --> 14:48.456
But normally I handle 10, 20, 30, 50, 200 books.

14:48.997 --> 14:51.980
And these are books you've never seen before, of course.

14:52.260 --> 14:53.601
Oh, lots.

14:53.762 --> 14:57.345
Every day in my life I have discovered 10 and...

14:57.595 --> 14:59.517
hundreds of books I have never seen.

14:59.537 --> 15:04.643
You've never heard of before, never seen, but you know instantly or you have a feeling of its importance.

15:06.245 --> 15:07.407
I'm wondering how that happens.

15:07.487 --> 15:08.648
Well, that's a good question.

15:09.169 --> 15:24.707
That happens because when you, well, I'm not a musician, but I suppose that when you hear something, you can associate it with some notes or some key, key you call in English, etc.

15:24.827 --> 15:25.728
You place a thing.

15:26.148 --> 15:27.450
Well, when I see a book

15:27.785 --> 15:43.025
If it's printed in the 17th century, which I see immediately, I don't need to see the date, of course, and I see even in what part of the 17th century or the 16th century it has been printed, then a sort of a recognition arises.

15:43.405 --> 15:50.855
I see you in the subway, and then I see your head, and I say, oh, this reminds me of Nichols.

15:50.875 --> 15:51.476
Is this Nichols?

15:51.496 --> 15:52.818
No, it just looks like him.

15:53.178 --> 15:57.724
And then I turn the headquarter, and I say, oh, yes, it's Nichols, okay.

15:58.109 --> 15:58.910
And I know everything.

15:59.391 --> 16:00.793
And that's the same with a book.

16:02.095 --> 16:20.322
When I see a book first, well, I see how the title is written, then it comes at the same time, immediately, in the same space of seconds, four, five, ten seconds, you see a sort of identification.

16:20.822 --> 16:26.631
You know that the book is of such part of a thought

16:27.303 --> 16:32.670
That is a book of philosophy or a book of Joseph or a book of medicine.

16:32.770 --> 16:36.154
And then you approach it very quickly.

16:36.675 --> 16:41.581
You see that it's by Harvey or by the circle of Harvey.

16:41.921 --> 16:43.524
Or then you don't know anything about it.

16:43.984 --> 16:45.726
And then you start working on it.

16:46.227 --> 16:49.251
Then you start working on it as the key phrase.

16:49.511 --> 16:54.998
Because you represent something I really want to express and I hope I can do in this new book is

16:55.636 --> 17:01.302
this tradition of the great European bookseller, which... I don't know if it's European.

17:01.322 --> 17:05.627
I don't think... I think it's a librarianship as much as a bookseller.

17:05.687 --> 17:06.648
Librarianship.

17:07.089 --> 17:08.070
It's a librarianship.

17:08.150 --> 17:08.690
It's a thing.

17:08.730 --> 17:16.879
You have to sort the thing and to put it in its frame, in its life.

17:18.881 --> 17:20.463
You have to understand it.

17:20.783 --> 17:24.968
And one of the best ways, of course, is to look at it, to handle it,

17:25.218 --> 17:26.760
to collate it and to read it.

17:27.781 --> 17:29.443
That's a really proper way to approach.

17:29.523 --> 17:31.245
Then you know lots of things about it.

17:32.306 --> 17:36.912
You mentioned in the essay you describe the amateur book collector.

17:36.932 --> 17:41.197
What is the amateur book collector and then, by contrast, who's the professional book collector?

17:41.397 --> 17:42.338
Or is there such a thing?

17:43.039 --> 17:44.281
You mentioned amateurs.

17:44.701 --> 17:45.742
Well, starting, yes.

17:47.304 --> 17:47.725
I'm sorry?

17:48.165 --> 17:49.587
Well, the one who starts, yes.

17:49.667 --> 17:54.853
Who starts, but a professional or somebody who has experience, I gather.

17:55.323 --> 17:58.747
You mean, an amateur is a beginner, in other words.

17:58.767 --> 18:00.208
In other words, it's a beginner, yes.

18:00.469 --> 18:03.032
I didn't use the word amateur.

18:03.052 --> 18:04.033
I think so, right.

18:04.053 --> 18:05.534
It's a bad translation.

18:06.055 --> 18:10.780
Well, amateur has a double meaning, probably, in English, too.

18:11.081 --> 18:23.254
Anyhow, in French, it has two meanings at the same time of the occasional one, or the one who loves.

18:23.639 --> 18:34.534
Amateurs come from Amare, the lover in every sense of the word, the one who sleeps with it, who lives with the book.

18:34.554 --> 18:36.957
And you have to sleep to fuck the book.

18:37.758 --> 18:39.901
Excuse me.

18:39.961 --> 18:41.683
I mean, you have to go through it.

18:42.204 --> 18:43.866
We might change that to say make love.

18:43.886 --> 18:44.567
Is that okay?

18:44.783 --> 18:47.607
With your permission.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.952
I don't like the word make love.

18:51.012 --> 18:53.215
No, I don't like the other word.

18:53.276 --> 18:55.138
I don't like, I'm not a strong term.

18:56.741 --> 19:00.426
But make love is a way you've got to love.

19:00.546 --> 19:04.452
So more noble, so more important, so more complicated.

19:04.913 --> 19:08.658
But I'm amazed that you use that context for a book.

19:09.039 --> 19:11.162
Because then it really is passion, isn't it?

19:12.222 --> 19:18.047
You described a passionate act to describe the communion with the book.

19:18.708 --> 19:22.091
I'm wondering where that comes from in science.

19:22.411 --> 19:24.893
It's a way of handling them.

19:25.113 --> 19:27.716
Potatoes are the same thing.

19:27.856 --> 19:30.678
You peel potatoes and then you cook them.

19:31.679 --> 19:33.200
First you choose them by sight.

19:33.681 --> 19:38.345
You go to a market, you see potatoes, you choose them by sight.

19:38.925 --> 19:40.727
By experience, of course, also.

19:41.028 --> 19:48.638
You see that they are the good quality of the pink ones you don't like, the yellow ones you like, the white ones are more delicate and have less flavor.

19:49.239 --> 19:58.491
You buy them, then you peel them, and then you cook them, or you cook them while peeling, then you taste them, then you put butter, et cetera, put salt and pepper, et cetera.

19:58.511 --> 19:59.333
It's the same thing.

19:59.533 --> 20:01.956
I mean, you have to proceed to think.

20:02.645 --> 20:03.987
You have to be complete about it.

20:04.007 --> 20:05.569
In love, it's the same thing.

20:05.609 --> 20:11.918
You have to look at the lady, and then to smile to her, and then to see that you are not rebuked.

20:12.219 --> 20:18.528
And then you have to be humble, and then you have to be brave, and not to be afraid of a lady, etc., etc.

20:18.628 --> 20:21.392
It's a long process for a merited woman.

20:21.852 --> 20:29.443
What is the greatest satisfaction for you, the greatest pleasure that you get as a bookman?

20:30.545 --> 20:31.386
Good question.

20:31.889 --> 20:36.734
very numerous, the establishment of the book.

20:36.854 --> 20:45.084
I mean, where I really identify the book and its story, when the book is familiar and clear to me.

20:46.565 --> 20:57.497
And the more uncommon novel it is to be, the more fun I have in discovery and describing.

20:58.679 --> 21:00.040
You see, in my profession,

21:00.340 --> 21:02.002
Everything ends with a description.

21:02.663 --> 21:09.952
My descriptions are very, very long, perhaps too long sometimes, but they are very thorough.

21:10.012 --> 21:11.835
I hope that they are very thorough.

21:12.295 --> 21:16.861
They always follow a certain line which I tried to describe.

21:17.322 --> 21:19.805
Well, lack of space, I couldn't describe entirely.

21:20.366 --> 21:28.997
But you see, booksellers or book dealers, let's say, etc.,

21:29.281 --> 21:31.405
Well, many people sell books.

21:32.286 --> 21:36.814
They look at bibliographies, which should not be called bibliographies, all of them.

21:36.834 --> 21:37.996
I try to explain this.

21:38.016 --> 21:39.618
That's a long story also.

21:40.079 --> 21:41.061
But they look at books.

21:41.662 --> 21:44.487
They take some books like Carter, John Carter, or any other.

21:44.947 --> 21:46.991
And they say, oh, this is the first edition.

21:47.191 --> 21:48.894
It's worth 10 pounds.

21:49.355 --> 21:50.537
Well, I never do that.

21:50.697 --> 21:54.343
And it has 48 pages plus a two-page number.

21:54.695 --> 21:55.896
I never do that, you see.

21:55.936 --> 22:06.027
I never look at bibliography, or a reference book rather, especially which I prefer, before having finished my tour, my promenade with the book.

22:06.748 --> 22:24.668
You see, so I look at the book, I enjoy looking it, or I disagree with it with tight face or so, and then I make a tour of it, and then I make a collation, then I see the height and the broadness, and then I read it somehow,

22:24.935 --> 22:28.681
not perhaps in total, but I read sufficiently.

22:28.781 --> 22:42.663
I'm a publisher also, so I have a certain habit of reading quickly, at least at getting a flavor, a real flavor, some understanding of a book.

22:43.084 --> 22:50.335
Of course, I start collating, which means that I know there are two or three books bound together in there.

22:50.737 --> 22:53.820
in a group, etc.

22:55.622 --> 23:11.379
In 16th-century or 15th-century books, very often two or three works bound together, so you never know by which you have to start your description, which is the most interesting, etc.

23:11.399 --> 23:15.003
I don't give a darn about finances.

23:15.423 --> 23:19.107
I give the same care, you see, since many, many years,

23:19.424 --> 23:30.519
25, 30 years, I have a bad habit of giving the same amount of my time, which I don't have, for a 20-pound book.

23:30.659 --> 23:30.999
Really?

23:31.400 --> 23:32.561
Oh, really, definitely.

23:32.721 --> 23:34.243
I'll spend the same time.

23:34.964 --> 23:46.900
No, I'll spend sometimes much more time because a 20-pound book or 25-pound book, I knew nothing about it.

23:47.200 --> 23:52.467
Many times, if it happened to myself, because I wouldn't buy a 25-pound book, I would need them.

23:53.128 --> 24:12.095
Whereas a 5,000-pound book, well, I can't say that I know none of all of them, but I have met or seen, traded, seen, met, heard of, well, a great majority of them.

24:12.616 --> 24:14.819
So, I mean, you can't... You're familiar with them.

24:15.019 --> 24:17.022
Well, I'm very familiar with them, yes.

24:17.272 --> 24:38.194
Even if I don't know them, I mean, an unknown broadside on a voyage in the 18th century or an unknown four-pages or eight-pages pamphlet of the 15th century or 16th century, I immediately understand where it stands and what it's about.

24:38.575 --> 24:39.856
The significance.

24:39.876 --> 24:41.938
Well, if it is significant or not.

24:42.659 --> 24:43.600
Exactly, but where...

24:43.799 --> 24:54.630
So actually your curiosity is sharpened more by the book that might be regarded as a lambda book, I guess.

24:54.830 --> 24:56.973
No, no, I can't tell.

24:56.993 --> 24:58.474
I don't make any distinction.

24:58.494 --> 25:03.319
I do my job, which is a gardener's job, which is a curator's job.

25:03.920 --> 25:07.984
I'm a gardener and a curator.

25:09.668 --> 25:12.111
to read the book and to read it.

25:12.172 --> 25:17.098
Do you still do all the descriptions yourself?

25:17.679 --> 25:17.799
All.

25:18.661 --> 25:18.821
All.

25:19.342 --> 25:19.522
All?

25:20.023 --> 25:21.645
You write all the descriptions yourself?

25:21.665 --> 25:22.566
All the descriptions myself.

25:22.927 --> 25:33.942
Sometimes, from time to time, I have somebody who makes a collation, but always on the book, not reference books.

25:33.962 --> 25:39.490
And then, after all, I allow that reference book to be consulted, because if you have a complicated book,

25:39.841 --> 25:59.201
17th century illustrated books, etc., where you don't really know if it has 47 plates or 52, etc., then I find 47 plates, and he finds 47 plates, and I say, now let's check what the Berliner Museum says about that book, how many they have, etc.

25:59.581 --> 26:02.024
And I check the bibliography, of course.

26:02.044 --> 26:07.249
And then I check, and then I check, I have an extremely, I have

26:07.803 --> 26:25.823
many thousands or tens of thousands of cards which I have made out of my descriptions of reputable colleague descriptions and I check if I have forgotten anything and then if there is something to be quoted by somebody who then I say who did that.

26:26.524 --> 26:31.449
I never cite my references except they be appropriate.

26:31.529 --> 26:37.776
I mean I don't cite the British Anticlipiator nor LaRousse nor Brunet nor

26:37.992 --> 26:57.132
or so I mean that's the knowledge of everybody just as the spelling of the word is your possession and you don't say I spell that word spelling with two L's and I-N-G because it's in the dictionary I don't refer to my source but when my source comes

26:57.398 --> 26:59.941
When my source comes from me, I don't say it.

27:00.041 --> 27:05.867
And of course, it's obvious, but when my source comes from Querish's, which is very rare, but from E.P.

27:05.907 --> 27:12.674
Goldsmith, which can come sometimes, or from Er Weill, I say, as Mr. Weill said, of course.

27:12.694 --> 27:14.076
Well, is this pride?

27:15.857 --> 27:20.162
You say you don't look at references prior to doing writing your own research?

27:20.242 --> 27:20.482
Oh, never.

27:20.643 --> 27:21.604
And then you look at it.

27:21.624 --> 27:23.946
So this must be professional pride at work here.

27:24.483 --> 27:29.729
No, it's safety.

27:29.769 --> 27:31.271
I mean, I don't want to be a fool.

27:31.712 --> 27:36.217
I mean, I don't want to... But you're trusting your judgment more than the published reference, then?

27:36.537 --> 27:43.145
No, no, I don't find any, nor my, nor published reference as certain.

27:43.986 --> 27:44.687
Absolutely not.

27:45.428 --> 27:46.689
You can absolutely not know.

27:48.051 --> 27:52.296
No, if you read some of my... No, you can never know what...

27:52.732 --> 27:56.397
I'll give you an example, for instance.

27:56.417 --> 28:18.705
In a sale which I conducted 15 days ago, May 28th, I came from Italy two, well, three or four, but there were two extremely rare Italian books of the 16th century, which more or less obscene, obscene the sense of it.

28:19.175 --> 28:21.538
16 then, especially the 19th century.

28:21.558 --> 28:26.985
They were not very obscene to how many of the lady could hear of them very easily.

28:28.287 --> 28:38.120
But they were extremely rare, and neither were really well described, and I couldn't find a reference to any copy.

28:39.001 --> 28:41.925
And for some reason, since they were Italian, etc.,

28:42.850 --> 28:49.362
I looked at first in what his name, two volumes, start with a C, who had all the books.

28:49.763 --> 28:50.945
And then I went to Libri.

28:51.766 --> 28:55.052
And Libri, not surprisingly, had both books.

28:56.235 --> 29:01.564
And in both cases, in both cases, it's interesting, I cited the things I... This is Libri, the famous Libri.

29:01.705 --> 29:04.690
Yes, famous Libri, who was a genius and a thief.

29:04.957 --> 29:09.281
and a scoundrel, a scoundrel, and an absolute genius.

29:09.762 --> 29:13.065
I've never heard him described as a genius, but that's... Absolute genius.

29:13.105 --> 29:16.989
Well, read that fabulous book which has been... No, I have to forget it before we go home.

29:17.169 --> 29:19.151
It's supposed to be... Oh, it's a fantastic book.

29:19.171 --> 29:20.612
It's not available in the States.

29:20.973 --> 29:22.454
It's not available in the States?

29:22.474 --> 29:22.634
No, no.

29:22.654 --> 29:26.198
Well, I'll give you the... But you know, I'll try and get it tomorrow.

29:26.318 --> 29:30.382
It's a biography of Count Libri, Guillermo Libri, the great book.

29:30.402 --> 29:30.922
Guillermo.

29:30.942 --> 29:33.765
But I always knew that she was a genius.

29:34.100 --> 29:46.135
because I tell you how you can know the key genius, you just have to read the preface, which is published in French and English, to, I think, 1859, Catalogue of a Libre Sale at Solveig.

29:46.776 --> 29:55.988
And there you have the first insight, you have the first perception, you have the first feeling of book collection.

29:56.309 --> 30:03.718
She's the first one in that silly, stupid 19th century where you have two great books,

30:04.643 --> 30:12.958
gatherers of books, two great handlers of books, which is Mr. Phillips and Mr. Libri.

30:12.978 --> 30:15.762
You put Libri in Phillips' company.

30:15.782 --> 30:16.864
That's amazing.

30:17.225 --> 30:19.669
Well, there are two... Well, I'll tell you why.

30:19.830 --> 30:25.179
Because both of them... He robbed your country, for God's sake.

30:25.319 --> 30:27.202
Well, he robbed my country.

30:27.583 --> 30:29.807
Well, we'll come back to that.

30:30.226 --> 30:33.770
I don't defend him, although many distinguished people.

30:34.070 --> 30:35.271
You're Mr. Panizzi.

30:35.331 --> 30:36.693
You're great Mr. Panizzi.

30:37.854 --> 30:38.294
He's British.

30:38.314 --> 30:38.915
I'm American.

30:39.195 --> 30:39.456
Yes.

30:39.756 --> 30:46.903
Well, anyhow, Panizzi and my great-poster, Meremie, went to defend him.

30:47.624 --> 30:48.625
I'm not defending him.

30:48.865 --> 30:53.470
I'm admiring his personality, and I'm desperate about him.

30:53.811 --> 30:55.272
I'm very sorry for him.

30:55.572 --> 31:00.919
I pity him for him being such a scoundrel and such a stupid man.

31:01.239 --> 31:04.603
And I wonder where, as you say in crime story, search a woman.

31:05.284 --> 31:06.125
Cherche Lafemme.

31:06.305 --> 31:07.086
Cherche Lafemme.

31:07.507 --> 31:09.189
I wonder what happened to his life.

31:09.589 --> 31:15.296
Was it his mother or his mistress or his not-mistress or his boyfriend or what it was.

31:15.637 --> 31:18.580
But something, something occurred which... He needed money.

31:18.701 --> 31:21.684
That he lost a set of morals.

31:22.445 --> 31:23.807
He was a genius, obviously.

31:23.827 --> 31:24.668
I mean, that's...

31:24.884 --> 31:26.206
that's evident from everything.

31:26.506 --> 31:53.119
And to come back to what I was starting to tell you, just read that essay, and you will just admit that in the 19th century, from 50 to 1875, you had two persons who gathered millions, well, not millions, but hundreds of thousands of books, who both bought them, mind you, the books he stole, I don't know how many they were,

31:53.335 --> 31:56.799
But he bought an enormous quantity of books also.

31:57.560 --> 31:59.062
And he bought books at the time.

31:59.122 --> 32:07.132
You know, I bought for five pounds in the 1930s when I started at Mags.

32:07.552 --> 32:18.465
What I bought for five pounds or ten pounds, which was much money for me and quite a deal for Mr. Mags, you cannot have an idea what you could get at that time.

32:18.866 --> 32:20.608
And what in France for three francs,

32:20.825 --> 32:23.588
You could get a northern sailor for 20 francs.

32:23.848 --> 32:24.909
You got a beautiful book.

32:25.170 --> 32:32.438
Well, of course, the significant books, the books which were known as valuable, they were always expensive.

32:33.319 --> 32:36.122
But you got many books for nothing.

32:36.582 --> 32:49.296
And Mr. Libri was the one who understood that buying for 5 francs or 50 cents, which you could also find a book of the 16th century which has the silliness of somebody,

32:49.580 --> 32:51.002
was some extraordinary.

32:51.022 --> 32:58.090
And he explained to you all that story, and he says what a fourth-century manuscript means to the civilization.

32:58.411 --> 32:59.652
And nobody wrote that.

33:00.033 --> 33:04.839
So I refer you to that essay, to that preface.

33:04.859 --> 33:14.110
1859, if I'm not wrong, if I'm not mistaken, the first library great catalog of octavo, large octavo, at Sowerby's first sale.

33:14.450 --> 33:15.992
If you don't find it, I'll send you...

33:16.242 --> 33:18.766
But he's a contemporary of Philip's too, which is interesting.

33:18.786 --> 33:20.188
Exactly contemporary.

33:20.288 --> 33:28.079
So one was a stupid idiot who bought books and who sat on them, who showed them to nobody and who understood nothing.

33:28.580 --> 33:38.074
Another one was a clever, fine man who understood, who loved them, who was passionate of them, and who loved them.

33:38.474 --> 33:45.304
And then he stopped, I don't know, I'm not defending him as absurd, of course, because it's immoral and absurd, etc.

33:45.487 --> 33:51.037
But he started buying books for five pence or francs.

33:51.158 --> 33:54.243
It's obvious you admire his passion and his knowledge, though.

33:54.283 --> 33:54.965
That's pretty obvious.

33:54.985 --> 33:56.708
His knowledge is fantastic.

33:56.728 --> 33:58.872
See, he wrote the best book on mathematics.

33:59.020 --> 34:02.445
1854, I think, four volumes.

34:02.465 --> 34:05.429
It's still one of the best books in the history of mathematics.

34:05.449 --> 34:07.672
He's taught mathematics here at the Chauvin, I think.

34:07.692 --> 34:10.155
Of course, Collège de France, which is still better.

34:10.555 --> 34:18.947
He was a great, great learned man, and he was a diplomat, he was everything.

34:18.967 --> 34:21.130
He was a friend to the kings, etc.

34:21.170 --> 34:22.952
He was an extraordinary man.

34:23.624 --> 34:26.727
And you say Cherchez La Femme, that's the answer.

34:26.767 --> 34:29.630
Cherchez La Femme, well, that's a gap, obviously.

34:29.730 --> 34:35.657
That's probably the gap, or maybe his mother, or she wasn't brought down.

34:36.358 --> 34:37.939
He needed money, is what it comes to.

34:38.039 --> 34:42.564
No, because I don't, no, no, I'm not, it's obviously not a question of money.

34:43.345 --> 34:52.855
No, he got all the money he wanted, because, no, he didn't really need money, because first he hadn't had any needs, he lived very soberly,

34:53.662 --> 35:06.554
And then because he, no, no, he didn't use any money, he just got involved in that, you see, and I can very well not follow him, but understand, not excuse him, but understand how it went.

35:06.994 --> 35:23.550
You see, he, you see, I have seen that in the 19, I started in 19, what, 31, so I have seen all that in the 1935 or 40, you see, if I would go in a provincial town

35:24.070 --> 35:47.490
I would be able to buy for a few pennies or francs a fine 16th century book, which could absolvously, not necessarily, be a very rare, important book, which absolutely the dealer, the antiquarian, who would be a bookseller, would have no knowledge of reference books, would get the idea.

35:47.510 --> 35:53.655
I never found the first folio of Shakespeare, and I never found a part of Shakespeare,

35:53.956 --> 36:01.787
which would be still more, because I don't see why one wouldn't find in attics quarters of Shakespeare, etc.

36:02.207 --> 36:08.456
Well, I never found anything of that sort, except in the 19th century I found great things.

36:09.417 --> 36:20.672
But, you see, in the field of manuscripts and of painted books, you could obviously, certainly...

36:20.973 --> 36:40.171
in the 1830s, 1850s, 1880s, you see, Mary May, who was not a thief at all, was an extremely, extremely rigid and very strict man, a wonderful person, he was inspector to the monument, Mary May, Prospero Mary May.

36:40.711 --> 36:50.220
And he tells you, or I tell you, when I was 15 or 16 years old, I went to an official

36:50.403 --> 36:51.264
in Florence.

36:51.825 --> 36:52.826
What did I see?

36:53.607 --> 36:54.868
I asked to see some drawings.

36:55.088 --> 36:55.829
I like drawing.

36:56.290 --> 36:57.571
And they put me in a room.

36:58.072 --> 37:11.027
And there were packages of drawings, of all drawings, not of da Vinci, but of the 17th century, of 18th century, beautiful drawings, which would be worth 10, 12, 1,000 pounds each or so.

37:11.608 --> 37:13.130
And they were just there.

37:13.170 --> 37:20.258
And I was a youngster, and I could, I could, of course, take anything in my pocket, and I could, and I could, and I

37:20.525 --> 37:22.929
and I could tear it away.

37:23.389 --> 37:25.553
They were just here for us.

37:25.573 --> 37:30.841
At the Albertina, they started refusing to give the original drawings.

37:31.402 --> 37:43.140
I don't know, it's Mr, what's his name, the great, oh, you know his name, well, the great curator who started that, but Alpina.

37:43.913 --> 37:52.441
You were handed the Rembrandt and the Dürer drawings, and of course the later ones, as you wanted.

37:53.081 --> 37:55.343
This is the 1930s now.

37:55.363 --> 37:56.184
That's the 1930s.

37:56.845 --> 38:00.568
But what happened in the 1830s when I wasn't yet there?

38:00.848 --> 38:02.790
It's something quite different.

38:02.810 --> 38:05.933
You see, so I was in a provincial town.

38:06.293 --> 38:11.878
You go to a marketplace or so, they could sell you

38:12.145 --> 38:15.369
Spoils of wonderful manuscripts.

38:15.389 --> 38:36.212
Now listen, ten years ago, only ten years ago, eight years ago, I purchased, as Mr. Guter did, as Mr. Quirk did, as three or four people did, I purchased four or five of the most beautiful miniatures of apocalypses in that sale at Sotheby's.

38:36.513 --> 38:42.500
Do you remember that sale of all the cuttings which that man in the 1820s or 1830s made?

38:42.540 --> 38:44.282
They were the most fabulous thing.

38:44.642 --> 38:50.569
The apocalypses, you see, I have in my other flat with all my belongings.

38:50.809 --> 38:53.312
I have one of the most beautiful ones.

38:53.332 --> 39:00.540
You see, it's incredible what you put... Well, that I paid, I don't know, 2,000 pounds 10 years ago, you see.

39:00.560 --> 39:02.542
It's a monument by itself.

39:02.602 --> 39:03.864
It's only one horse.

39:04.204 --> 39:04.865
It's a monument.

39:05.245 --> 39:05.946
So, you see...

39:06.162 --> 39:21.141
The value of things, the appreciation of things, has so much varied since, well, the great move, except, of course, for the significant things, drawings or so.

39:21.161 --> 39:24.465
I mean, you could never buy a very fine print by Rembrandt.

39:24.886 --> 39:29.672
You could never, even in 1860s or 1880s, it had a value.

39:29.821 --> 39:31.563
It was a significant thing.

39:31.883 --> 39:40.893
But for Van Mekkonen, you see, which is much more important, who nobody knew, you can always buy it for very cheap.

39:41.274 --> 39:57.111
And to come again to the end of my story, in the provinces, in the remote places, you could find miniature, and I'm sure that the thing started that way, that he came to a town.

39:57.310 --> 39:59.053
And he bought a book for five francs.

39:59.314 --> 40:00.396
It was a nice book concept.

40:00.656 --> 40:02.059
He said, now do you have anything else?

40:02.480 --> 40:03.822
Oh, yes, would say the old man.

40:04.203 --> 40:05.325
Yes, I see, yes.

40:05.345 --> 40:07.148
And the church, they have some leaves.

40:07.168 --> 40:08.771
Would you like to have some?

40:08.791 --> 40:17.968
And he would go to the priest and say, now would you like to have ten francs for your...

40:18.033 --> 40:21.356
wine, mass wine or something like that?

40:21.376 --> 40:23.398
Oh, yes, he said, well, I don't care about that.

40:23.639 --> 40:24.880
You know very well that.

40:25.601 --> 40:38.173
I mean, it's just the same story as Mr. Cook's natives exchanging beautiful works of art against coals or beautiful coals against nothing, stones, etc.

40:38.514 --> 40:39.215
It's the same thing.

40:40.115 --> 40:41.437
Things had no value.

40:41.757 --> 40:46.622
You see, nobody knew, at Phillips' time, Mr. Phillips knew nothing about his belongings.

40:46.838 --> 40:49.782
Well, Mr. Libri, he knew exactly what he had.

40:50.563 --> 40:58.274
Sometimes, I come back to the story of Mr. Libri and the reference books to finish the story because I'm going too far in every direction.

40:58.875 --> 41:00.918
So I finished, you see, so he could.

41:01.239 --> 41:05.966
And then, of course, he bought things which had been stolen by other people than him.

41:06.486 --> 41:13.977
And then he went to the library because he was connected with librarians because he was a scholar, a different scholar.

41:14.125 --> 41:16.068
And so they would tell him, oh, you want to see?

41:16.328 --> 41:25.460
And just as I was in front of a drawing in the office where I didn't take anyone away, nor spoiled any of them, he would say, well, hell, they don't care.

41:26.221 --> 41:30.267
Well, I'll cut this leaf out and give them, well, that's very abominable.

41:30.547 --> 41:32.370
But I think that's the sea.

41:32.650 --> 41:34.492
And I'm sure he didn't make it for money.

41:35.954 --> 41:40.661
And then, of course, he committed abominable things because he falsified, etc.

41:41.061 --> 41:43.845
But that's the smallest side of the story.

41:44.703 --> 42:03.068
To come to one of his bad traits, again, I'm defending him as something also, for these two rare books, I went to the Libri catalogue and I found his copies of the two books, because he had great rarities, because he knew what rare books were, and he chased them, and he had them.

42:03.789 --> 42:10.117
So in the fourth or third sale of Libri, where there are all Italian books, I found my two books.

42:10.818 --> 42:14.423
And as I say in my catalogue, which I published,

42:14.943 --> 42:37.643
Tell us when it's getting late for you, Pierre.

42:37.842 --> 42:40.905
Tell us when it's getting late for you and you want us to go.

42:40.925 --> 42:42.987
No, sir, I will in a few minutes.

42:43.007 --> 42:46.030
Anyhow, so I explained the story.

42:46.370 --> 42:49.733
Mr. Liebrich had a copy of each of them which was incomplete.

42:50.294 --> 43:01.605
And so he tried to explain very cleverly that it seemed incomplete because it stopped at page 22 and it shouldn't have 24 pages, but it was all right like that.

43:01.625 --> 43:07.090
So I said in my description, the copies I had to sell were perfect.

43:07.390 --> 43:24.837
And after I had collated them, I checked, and I said, as Mr. Libri, a genius and a crook, and a wretch crook, very stupidly, very stupidly and very viciously, explaining his catalog, his copy, and the collations, and such and such.

43:25.337 --> 43:32.188
You see, so... Let's go back to, you say, 13 years old when you became... What happened?

43:32.208 --> 43:33.550
What caused you to become...

43:34.070 --> 44:01.697
What happened, that I was wandering through, that I lived near the Fontaine Carpeau, which is near the observatoire in Paris, and I went to the Lucille Goubron, which is a great college, and I walked there most times, and I went through a bookshop at which I stopped, and I saw books, and I looked at the dirty books, as you do at 13 years old,

44:02.048 --> 44:18.992
And then I had a pal who sat on the same bank, and one day he took out of his pocket a book, a tiny little 17th century book, a blau or LDB or so, and he said, now look about that.

44:19.472 --> 44:25.681
Oh, yes, well, I paid that 25 cents, which was part of farming also.

44:26.262 --> 44:30.047
And I said, oh, well, and that's what brought me to books.

44:30.668 --> 44:49.695
Because I had the feeling, I had the emotion to think that whereas there is no monument, no painting, which is intact since the 20th century, and that pointed me to think, to start to think about it.

44:49.715 --> 44:52.940
That was really the extreme lambda book.

44:52.960 --> 44:57.807
But this lambda book, you see, it couldn't by no means be brought

44:58.107 --> 45:03.632
into the significant titling because there was nothing.

45:04.253 --> 45:26.393
It was perhaps even an odd book, an odd volume of a series, but still, I had, you can have tomorrow for 50 cents today, 15 cents of an American dollar, you can still have for that amount of money an object which is of the 16th or 17th century, which is intact.

45:27.149 --> 45:32.335
which is intact and which shows you at its height civilization.

45:33.116 --> 45:42.226
You see, early printing, early setting, early binding, intact, and the thought of people transmitted by that.

45:43.007 --> 45:44.589
Explain that to Mr. Cave no more.

45:44.629 --> 45:46.151
No high spots.

45:46.812 --> 45:54.220
I mean, you don't have to have a high spot to jump of enthusiasm at the sight of a book.

45:54.301 --> 45:54.802
That's all.

45:55.162 --> 45:55.823
End of the story.

45:55.903 --> 46:02.893
And then you say in your essay that books can sit unread for centuries waiting to come alive.

46:03.354 --> 46:03.955
Exactly.

46:03.975 --> 46:04.556
I love that.

46:05.597 --> 46:08.161
And they're waiting for somebody to discover them, aren't they?

46:08.181 --> 46:08.381
Exactly.

46:08.982 --> 46:09.643
And they're here.

46:10.004 --> 46:11.466
You have to discover them every day.

46:11.506 --> 46:15.051
That's why I always look at my ten or two thousand books.

46:16.213 --> 46:17.755
Two thousand, yes, certainly.

46:17.815 --> 46:20.599
There are days where I look but more without soul.

46:21.480 --> 46:24.004
Looked at soul, not collated.

46:24.946 --> 46:38.623
I know this is a naive question, but can you think of some of your most exciting discoveries, some of your most exciting moments with books, something that was totally unexpected and yet so thoroughly absorbing?

46:38.644 --> 46:39.785
Every day, everything.

46:39.805 --> 46:41.627
No, I don't know.

46:41.767 --> 46:44.731
You see, I'm not Casanova, you see.

46:44.891 --> 46:46.273
You're no Casanova.

46:46.373 --> 46:47.475
No, I'm no Casanova.

46:47.495 --> 46:53.923
I mean, I respect books and I respect women, and I mean, there's no tableau de chasse.

46:54.443 --> 46:55.985
No, no, no, you see.

46:56.025 --> 46:58.649
And then it's different to me.

46:58.709 --> 47:02.655
I mean, I have the same pleasure.

47:02.675 --> 47:05.720
I don't have the same profit, but I don't care.

47:05.740 --> 47:07.322
I have enough money to live now.

47:07.402 --> 47:07.963
It's all right.

47:08.263 --> 47:14.012
I have enough to buy my big steak for two days or three days, so it's all right.

47:14.472 --> 47:21.483
But you see, I like what is there, the meaning of the book, what it says.

47:21.503 --> 47:23.826
I mean, it's my job...

47:24.059 --> 47:43.247
as a tutor to book, as a librarian, as a, I don't know, as a servant of a book to analyze, to bring it to life and to render it its honor and to, I don't know.

47:43.267 --> 47:51.720
Let's talk briefly and then we, because I know it's getting late, but we haven't discussed, because I think it is another very important aspect of what you do, is that you're a publisher.

47:52.072 --> 47:54.315
Well, that's something quite different.

47:54.455 --> 47:58.421
But it's quite different, but nevertheless it does represent... That's a creative word.

47:58.441 --> 47:59.182
That's a creative word.

47:59.323 --> 48:02.567
I'm a publisher, but I'm a very exacting publisher.

48:02.908 --> 48:05.451
I'll give you a catalog of my publishing company if I have it here.

48:05.932 --> 48:07.274
I'm creating books.

48:07.494 --> 48:09.397
I'm commissioning books.

48:09.618 --> 48:12.642
I very rarely publish a manuscript which is bought.

48:13.023 --> 48:14.605
When I publish it, I alter it.

48:16.167 --> 48:20.914
I have a shoot with many authors, and then they bless me after that.

48:21.248 --> 48:22.370
They're happy.

48:22.390 --> 48:23.391
You mean you change the text?

48:23.411 --> 48:24.694
Oh, yes, of everything.

48:25.194 --> 48:27.698
What are you not supposed to do there?

48:27.799 --> 48:30.062
Even scientific books in which I understand nothing.

48:31.104 --> 48:31.865
I understand nothing.

48:32.025 --> 48:33.608
So why did you change them then?

48:34.009 --> 48:34.910
To make them better.

48:35.811 --> 48:46.108
You see, in my publishing company, there is in the waiting room, there is on gold, printed in gold, a sentence from Erasmus's writing.

48:46.544 --> 49:06.381
which I don't know by heart, which is translated in French, which renders something like there is no man who is good enough not to be improved, not to be embettered, and there is no book which is not worth being rendered better.

49:07.223 --> 49:08.265
And that's from Erasmus.

49:08.566 --> 49:09.567
That's from Erasmus.

49:09.587 --> 49:10.027
Yes, sir.

49:10.188 --> 49:12.770
The world's first great professional writer.

49:12.790 --> 49:13.210
Yes, sir.

49:13.491 --> 49:13.911
Yes, sir.

49:14.412 --> 49:16.994
And so that's my motto in the publishing company.

49:17.014 --> 49:25.142
So when I don't... You see, when I publish a book by a chemist or a mathematician, I know nothing about it.

49:25.902 --> 49:32.669
But I have three instances, four instances, four episodes.

49:33.390 --> 49:34.911
I first look at the man.

49:36.173 --> 49:41.299
what he looks like, what he smells like, what's inside of him.

49:42.100 --> 49:43.182
I have my opinion on that.

49:45.104 --> 49:53.174
And then I see his writing, be he's writing in hand or he's writing on computer, the way it presents what it looks like.

49:54.135 --> 49:55.377
And that's very easy.

49:55.737 --> 50:02.586
I mean, you know 60% of a book by that first sight, of course, carefully.

50:03.224 --> 50:11.855
So there are many books I would really have to look at more, two pages, to send the usual, very polite, very kind, and encouraging letter.

50:12.415 --> 50:16.921
And then you have, and then I'm attracted to a book.

50:16.941 --> 50:18.803
That's a book which I have sent to me.

50:19.804 --> 50:21.787
And then, but a commission book is the same.

50:22.267 --> 50:29.055
And then I will send the book to two or three referees, and I'll see their opinion, how it's there.

50:29.416 --> 50:31.138
And then I'll talk to them again.

50:31.523 --> 50:39.878
Then I'll talk, then if I'm interested in the book, in the book, etc., then I'll do my small part of a job for a scientific book in which I did nothing.

50:40.298 --> 50:47.932
I'll just change his titles to make them more legible, more understandable, more appealing, and I'll change perhaps the order of chapters, etc.

50:48.032 --> 50:49.735
I mean, common sense.

50:49.900 --> 50:54.066
But you're not editing the content, so to speak, if it's mathematics and science.

50:54.086 --> 50:56.049
You're not changing his conclusions.

50:56.069 --> 50:57.752
I leave all the blondes to him.

50:58.132 --> 51:04.662
I mean, I have taken my responsibility by referees, so I know the theories sound.

51:05.503 --> 51:09.509
No, my books, my scientific books are excellent.

51:09.569 --> 51:19.063
But my interference is very small and superficial, let's say, in scientific books, but it's really, it's still very heavy.

51:19.263 --> 51:25.469
Whereas in literary books or historical books or art books, my interference is very, very, very heavy.

51:26.290 --> 51:34.779
Are you trying to create books that will last as long as the other books that you... Well, no, I never thought of that.

51:34.899 --> 51:40.806
I'm trying to do books that will not be spoiled in two, five, ten years.

51:40.906 --> 51:46.992
I'm trying to book... Well, in both senses, I mean physically and intellectually.

51:47.242 --> 51:49.766
I'm trying to publish books which will last for some time.

51:50.607 --> 51:51.789
Yes, definitely.

51:52.450 --> 52:07.012
Carly, I think we've... Yes, I'll give you... The press is named for a famous scientist, I think.

52:07.072 --> 52:07.613
Isn't that right?

52:08.053 --> 52:11.899
You name your press... This is Hermann?

52:12.166 --> 52:12.506
Yes.

52:12.847 --> 52:13.908
That's the name of the company.

52:14.108 --> 52:14.608
Is that the name?

52:14.669 --> 52:15.589
But who is Hermann?

52:15.670 --> 52:19.493
Was that... Well, it was... I knew nothing of him.

52:19.513 --> 52:20.154
I explained it.

52:20.174 --> 52:21.175
Oh, that was an individual.

52:21.195 --> 52:22.116
Yes, okay.

52:22.236 --> 52:23.337
I didn't know him.

52:23.437 --> 52:25.640
He died in 1910, I think.

52:25.660 --> 52:25.960
I see.

52:26.080 --> 52:28.042
And he found the company in 1900.

52:28.062 --> 52:30.064
You have no feeling about computers.

52:30.144 --> 52:36.271
To talk about computers and the future fate of books, I don't know what is going to happen to them.

52:36.291 --> 52:37.532
I hope nothing bad.

52:38.293 --> 52:41.616
But I don't see how you can escape

52:42.068 --> 52:48.658
You won't burn monumental books, and you can't get rid of the Delta books.

52:49.299 --> 53:04.702
And you can't also, I mean, the four categories I tried to establish, you can't escape them, because significant books will always remain even if they disappear.

53:05.002 --> 53:06.084
They still will exist.

53:06.104 --> 53:11.772
I mean, first is Copernicus in 1543, the date where appeared two great books,

53:11.903 --> 53:13.786
The Vesalus and the Copernicus.

53:13.806 --> 53:14.467
The same year.

53:15.528 --> 53:16.389
The same year.

53:16.649 --> 53:18.272
There's a third one, a secret book.

53:18.732 --> 53:22.237
I think it's in Agricola or something like that.

53:22.377 --> 53:24.160
Or below, I don't remember.

53:24.240 --> 53:25.822
Anyhow, these two are the same year.

53:26.283 --> 53:28.245
So they're high-spotted.

53:28.606 --> 53:29.147
I don't care.

53:29.227 --> 53:30.649
I'm not Mr. Haven anymore.

53:30.669 --> 53:32.531
I don't care if they are worth this or that.

53:32.932 --> 53:39.320
But what I'm interested in is that they are valuable, not in monetary sense, but in the real world.

53:39.401 --> 53:40.442
They're valuable books.

53:40.777 --> 53:51.770
And they will remain that even if you only feel yourself compelled to get a facsimile of them, which means that they're something, they're a monument.

53:51.790 --> 53:52.551
They're significant.

53:52.851 --> 53:53.232
Okay.

53:53.632 --> 54:03.264
And then the chosen book, well, you can't avoid that if you have an inscription from Mr. I don't know, T.S.

54:03.284 --> 54:05.506
Eliot to Mr. Lawrence.

54:05.967 --> 54:10.412
Well, it's a very exciting book, a choice book, whatever the book is.

54:10.730 --> 54:12.272
That's all.

54:12.332 --> 54:16.278
Well, you're getting the book for the inscription and not the content of the book.

54:17.479 --> 54:21.145
At that point, it's the inscription that matters and not the content of the book.

54:21.605 --> 54:23.147
That is a chosen book.

54:23.167 --> 54:24.950
A chosen book.

54:25.150 --> 54:31.419
A ten-pence book, which is chosen by the thing that exists in the extraordinary inscription, is chosen.

54:31.819 --> 54:37.227
If it's the first edition of

54:37.544 --> 54:42.170
It's a significant group.

54:42.191 --> 54:44.093
Then it's better.

54:44.334 --> 54:46.957
All that is explained.

54:47.838 --> 54:51.964
And then you say also that you feel that the collector is an endangered species.

54:53.406 --> 54:55.489
Not the collector, the collection.

54:55.549 --> 54:57.872
The libraries, the great libraries, yes.

54:58.053 --> 54:58.894
Great libraries, yes.

54:58.914 --> 54:59.775
They're going to disappear.

54:59.795 --> 55:00.496
They may be.

55:00.596 --> 55:02.239
I mean, it's difficult nowadays.

55:03.300 --> 55:06.024
Well, you see, Mr. Heaven and More is a sad example.

55:06.044 --> 55:06.825
It's very difficult.

55:07.210 --> 55:10.414
We have collectors, they sell their collection very quickly.

55:11.095 --> 55:19.887
Mr. Hawkman just sold his botanical books that he bought at Belger, 20 years ago, 15 years ago.

55:19.907 --> 55:21.389
He didn't keep them.

55:21.489 --> 55:22.390
Why did he buy them?

55:22.430 --> 55:23.591
Why did he sell them?

55:23.611 --> 55:24.032
I don't know.

55:24.052 --> 55:26.395
But, I mean, that's not a book collector.

55:26.415 --> 55:27.917
Mr. Libri didn't do that.

55:27.977 --> 55:29.519
He kept them for years and years.

55:29.559 --> 55:30.801
Mr. Phillips killed more.

55:31.982 --> 55:35.547
Without asking you to get up, you were going to give me the title of the Libri book?

55:36.758 --> 55:38.471
the title of the publisher.

55:38.491 --> 55:42.280
So I can get it, I'll get it in London.
