Alaska with 102.5, WCRB, Mozart, piano concerto number 24.

17:58.170 --> 18:01.715
Piennist Alfred Brindle with Sir Neville Mariner in the Academy of St.

18:01.795 --> 18:07.122
Martin and Fields, 24 before 3 o'clock, and we'll check 49 degrees.

18:07.142 --> 18:16.275
I'm Ray Brown, coming up, music by Sir Arthur Sullivan, Arcangelo Corelli, and then some favorite pieces from St.

18:16.996 --> 18:17.837
John's and Debbie Fee.

18:18.391 --> 18:26.021
Well, if you're a new WCRB Classical Advantage cardholder, you should know that you're automatically entered to win prizes every week of the year.

18:26.041 --> 18:32.069
It's Thursday, looking to see if you're the winner of a pair of pickets to an evening of romantic Italian opera fans.

18:32.149 --> 18:46.828
For the Newton Symphony Orchestra, January 25th, at the Aquinas College Auditorium in Newton Corner, Dr. Jeffrey Rink has invited some of Boston's most popular operatic voices to perform in the concert using Ciccini, Verde, Cassini and Bellini.

18:47.045 --> 19:02.005
To learn more about the WCRB Classical Advantage card by calling 617-964-WCRB.

19:02.025 --> 19:04.648
Saturday night, WCRB listeners heard the incomparable George Kirschman perform Rhapsody in Blue at the Boston Fox at Symphony Hall.

19:04.668 --> 19:05.830
Kirschman performed on the Yamaha Disco Deer Player Piano.

19:05.810 --> 19:16.553
This weekend, you can listen to George Gershwin play on the Yamaha Discovere in your own home.

19:16.573 --> 19:17.776
The Discovere is a far side from an ordinary player's piano.

19:17.796 --> 19:19.600
It combines a traditional acoustic Yamaha piano with state-of-the-art computer technology.

19:20.086 --> 19:29.789
For the Gershwin performances, the information encoded by Gershwin himself on traditional piano rolls more than 60 years ago was converted into a computer image.

19:29.809 --> 19:34.681
The data was stored on a floppy disk and then played live on the disk of the air.

19:34.781 --> 19:36.525
Austin Pops was stuck, able to accompany

19:36.505 --> 20:00.049
Yo no quiero pasar pruebas.

20:01.042 --> 20:10.601
After Sarah was taken, I found a Sunday School paper that she had done in Sunday School, and it was probably done a month before.

20:11.983 --> 20:15.690
And it asked three questions, and she had written her little answers out.

20:15.710 --> 20:20.620
And the first question was, how do people see that you love God?

20:21.005 --> 20:25.330
And she said, we have a Bible in our house and we have a manger scene at Christmas.

20:26.131 --> 20:29.835
And the second question was, do you tell people about God?

20:29.955 --> 20:32.157
And she had said, no, I'm shy.

20:35.020 --> 20:37.463
And I need you to hear the third question.

20:40.767 --> 20:44.551
How do people know you love God?

20:44.571 --> 20:45.612
And she wrote...

20:46.081 --> 20:52.429
I forgive them.

20:52.829 --> 20:53.691
Three years pulled.

20:54.892 --> 20:59.978
Many people live long lives, decades, and they don't get it.

21:01.540 --> 21:03.943
Sarah Elizabeth Pryor got it.

21:04.524 --> 21:11.633
She got it at age three, she got it at age four, she got it at age five, six, seven, eight, and nine.

21:12.068 --> 21:13.634
Barbara Pryor, Sarah's mother.

21:13.714 --> 21:16.826
Sarah would have celebrated her 22nd birthday today.

21:16.866 --> 21:23.631
Her death was confirmed after the positive identification of a skull fragment found a few miles from her Wayland home.

21:24.539 --> 21:26.243
Other stories this afternoon.

21:26.263 --> 21:29.971
Health maintenance organizations could face stiffer regulations in this state.

21:30.051 --> 21:36.565
Acting Governor Solucci has filed a bill that would create a managed care ombudsman to help patients exercise their rights.

21:36.585 --> 21:42.919
Governor Solucci says the legislation will ensure health considerations drive doctors' decisions rather than money.

21:43.372 --> 21:47.178
Legislators around the country are making similar proposals relating to HMOs.

21:47.258 --> 21:52.106
ABC's Bill Greenwood reports on growing criticism of the managed care industry.

21:52.126 --> 22:02.342
With more than a thousand health care bills now pending in state legislatures, the managed care industry sees a distinct link between critical news coverage and a growing public backlash.

22:02.322 --> 22:09.533
A study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 65% of the news reports about managed healthcare have been neutral.

22:09.954 --> 22:16.023
But during the past eight years, the number of critical reports more than doubled, jumping from 12 to 28%.

22:16.423 --> 22:23.554
Kaiser reviewed 2,100 news stories, including TV broadcasts, which were found to be the most damaging.

22:23.838 --> 22:26.302
Bill Greenwood, ABC News, Washington.

22:26.342 --> 22:28.966
And a new strain of influenza may be spreading around the country.

22:29.006 --> 22:32.352
The sickness is different from the flus that are covered by this year's vaccine.

22:32.792 --> 22:34.335
They've hit two states so far.

22:34.355 --> 22:41.686
The type A Sydney flu has been found in about 40% of all cases studied by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since October.

22:42.107 --> 22:45.773
The new flu places the elderly and the chronically ill at greater risk.

22:46.434 --> 22:50.200
WBZ Newstime now at 2.39 and business news is coming up.

22:50.990 --> 22:53.272
How has humor changed in America?

22:53.392 --> 22:56.395
For that matter, do we still have a sense of humor in America?

22:56.415 --> 23:07.426
I'm David Brodnoy, Boston University professor and humor specialist Joseph Boskin joins me tonight at 10 to talk about our funny bone right here on WBZ Newsradio 1030.

23:08.787 --> 23:11.330
WBZ News Time is coming up on 2.40 now.

23:11.410 --> 23:20.018
In New England business, Millennium Pharmaceuticals of Cambridge has been granted a patent for what it calls its first patent in the field of predictive medicine.

23:20.470 --> 23:25.097
The patent is entitled, Methods for the Diagnosis of Body Weight Disorders, Including Obesity.

23:25.137 --> 23:33.510
The patent covers methods for diagnosing weight disorders in which the UCPH gene transcript or the UCPH protein level is measured.

23:33.610 --> 23:38.037
That protein discovered by Millennium is involved in energy expenditure and in weight control.

23:38.258 --> 23:47.592
The patent test can be used to help understand the genetic basis of a patient's weight disorder and also to diagnose individuals who are at risk of developing a body weight disorder such as obesity.

23:48.280 --> 23:50.284
And inflation continues to be low.

23:50.304 --> 23:54.912
The Labor Department says the consumer price index rose one-tenth of one percent for the month of December.

23:55.293 --> 24:01.765
All of 1997, inflation at the retail level was up just 1.7 percent, the smallest rise in 11 years.

24:02.246 --> 24:06.494
The December core CPI, that's minus food and energy, rose two-tenths.

24:06.514 --> 24:11.824
Analysts do not expect inflation pressures to build anytime soon, held in check by Asia's troubled economy.

24:12.935 --> 24:18.945
And to check on Wall Street now, the Dow 30 Industrials are up 53 points at 7,700.

24:18.965 --> 24:26.977
The standard in 4,500 is up 9, and the NASDAQ composite is up 26 points.

24:27.057 --> 24:28.680
In Boston, 48 degrees.

24:28.700 --> 24:33.688
It is drizzling, and here is the extended WBZ AccuWeather forecast with meteorologist Elliot Abrams.

24:33.768 --> 24:38.115
Bills getting milder out there, a good thing, because we don't expect any ice or anything like that.

24:38.483 --> 24:41.093
Expecting afternoon temperatures to get up to 48 degrees.

24:41.233 --> 24:44.646
Flurry possible this evening, then clearing low 16 inland at 24 at the coast.

24:45.228 --> 24:47.818
Far brisk and cold, sunshine at few clouds by 32.

24:48.085 --> 24:50.027
Thursday, freezing cloudy, it's high 34.

24:50.047 --> 24:52.049
There could be some snow late Thursday into Friday.

24:52.069 --> 24:53.130
Friday, it's high 32.

24:53.650 --> 24:54.791
Next weather in just 10 minutes.

24:54.911 --> 24:56.993
I'm WBZ, active weather meteorologist, Elliot Abrams.

24:57.013 --> 24:58.715
And again, we are at 48 degrees.

24:58.795 --> 25:02.298
It is drizzling, and we have traffic coming up in about a minute and a half.

25:02.318 --> 25:05.981
But right now, let's have a look at the law with attorney Neil Chayette.

25:06.121 --> 25:08.583
This is Neil Chayette looking at the law.

25:09.104 --> 25:14.008
When a football coach runs his students to death, will the coach and the school be held responsible?

25:14.329 --> 25:18.092
That was the question in a case recently decided by a federal district court in South Texas

25:18.072 --> 25:28.147
16-year-old Donald Roventini was participating in the first day of fall football practice, which consisted of more than four hours of intense outdoor physical activity on a hot and humid summer day.

25:28.187 --> 25:32.393
According to the lawsuit later filed by Donald's family, there was no rest, not enough water.

25:32.854 --> 25:38.342
Near the end of the practice, Donald and the others were required to perform 200-yard sprints within 45 seconds.

25:38.322 --> 25:42.827
Donald said he didn't feel well, but the coaches told him to go ahead anyway, and a few minutes later he collapsed.

25:43.108 --> 25:47.993
He allegedly received no medical assistance while the coaches held a team meeting a few yards away.

25:48.374 --> 25:59.807
Donald died a few hours later, and in the lawsuit that followed against 13 coaches and the school district, the family claimed violation of Donald's constitutional rights to life, liberty, health, safety, and bodily integrity.

25:59.787 --> 26:09.337
The defense asked the case be dismissed, but the court said the Constitution protects a school child from deprivation of his life caused by the callous indifference of public school officials.

26:09.797 --> 26:20.188
So Donald's case will continue for trial, and coaches should make sure that the first down does not become the last down, and that the students for whom they are responsible do not enter the end zone.

26:20.829 --> 26:23.972
This is Neal Chayette looking at the law.

26:24.880 --> 26:29.546
WBZ New Time at 2.43, and it's time for a good look at that traffic.

26:29.586 --> 26:31.749
Let's see what's happening on this Tuesday afternoon.

26:31.789 --> 26:33.251
Here's WBZ's Ian Gordon.

26:33.271 --> 26:36.775
This report being brought to you by Frugal Fannies, downtown Boston.

26:36.795 --> 26:45.867
Central Artery southbound, a minor accident reported in the right lane near the High Street ramp, and that is going to cause a delay, leaving the lower deck of Route 93.

26:45.947 --> 26:49.371
The impression of Route 128 as follows.

26:49.451 --> 26:52.315
The upper portion, no backups yet between Waltham and Redding.

26:52.335 --> 26:54.718
128 southbound in the lower portion.

26:54.698 --> 26:59.223
is at the speed limit leaving the mass bike down to Route 24 in Randolph.

26:59.243 --> 27:02.126
Mass bike westbound off and running to Route 495.

27:02.967 --> 27:06.531
Stahl Drive on the way in, moderate volume at the Fiedler footbridge.

27:06.811 --> 27:09.534
Sullivan inbound is still quite windy on the center span.

27:09.854 --> 27:11.937
Sumner out of Logan, no complaints.

27:12.237 --> 27:17.803
Expressway north, congestion continues from the Ponce to the gas tank and again at East Berkeley Street.

27:18.023 --> 27:19.685
We'll check it again in less than 10 minutes.

27:19.805 --> 27:22.528

Here's Gil Tanto.

The Celtics play tonight.

28:44.332 --> 28:45.554
The Bruins are off tonight.

28:45.594 --> 28:49.419
The Bruins a 1-1 tie last night with the New Jersey Devils at the Fleet Center.

28:49.799 --> 28:58.851
The reason the Bruins got the tie in this game against a very tough New Jersey Devils team, says Ray Bork, is because the Bruins are willing to play a patient, disciplined game.

29:04.788 --> 29:29.091
Oh, my God.

29:35.281 --> 29:48.902
Oh.

31:38.738 --> 31:50.149

I'm Dave Mended.

39:03.668 --> 39:05.832
We will open the book on the other side.

39:06.613 --> 39:08.938
In a moment.

39:08.958 --> 39:13.827
In 1906, as the women of America made a commitment to do the same work as men,

39:14.178 --> 39:20.307
CNA made a commitment to the women of America by being one of the first to ensure them for accidents and illnesses.

39:20.768 --> 39:25.155
CNA understands that any commitment carries with it a certain degree of risk.

39:25.235 --> 39:33.488
So for over a century, they've been committed to helping people manage their risks, be they ordinary or extraordinary.

39:33.508 --> 39:36.152
CNA, for all the commitments you make.

39:37.212 --> 39:42.119
Imagine how dirty a carpet with 40,000 people a day walking on it can get.

39:42.139 --> 39:43.301
Hi, I'm David Oreck.

39:43.461 --> 39:47.227
I'm here at International Airport where my 8-pound Oreck XL is a vacuum of choice.

39:47.587 --> 39:53.917
In fact, my Oreck XL is the choice of cleaning professionals in thousands of hotels, offices, and schools around the world.

39:54.498 --> 39:57.522
To try it in your own home for 15 days, call 1-800-989-4200.

39:57.542 --> 40:02.950
That's 1-800-989-4200.

40:02.930 --> 40:05.854
And I'll get it to you faster than you can find your luggage.

40:06.174 --> 40:09.038
But you know, Barbie is a bit more versatile than we thought.

40:09.479 --> 40:14.906
At least she's portrayed that way in a new book called Barbie Unbound, written by Vermont author Sarah Strohmeyer.

40:15.266 --> 40:17.449
Up here in Vermont, everyone is so politically correct.

40:17.469 --> 40:22.937
They all wear Birkenstocks and breastfeed their children until their kids are three, that Barbie is a pariah.

40:23.718 --> 40:25.961
And they take Barbie really seriously.

40:26.021 --> 40:31.468
So what I decided to do is kind of poke fun at them and also at Barbie herself and decided to turn Barbie into...

40:31.820 --> 41:00.004
uh historical and contemporary role models that women have endured strohmeyer has a rather twisted take on america's favorite doll yeah we have overweight adolescent outcast barbie she's fat she's got pimples we have barbie goes the co-op she's got you know hairy legs and uh we have pms barbie with fangs and she's about to rip ken to shreds it's kind of a sampling of kind of the contemporary situations and then historically we've got uh barbie of arc like joan of arc and uh

41:00.558 --> 41:03.081
Oh, Barbie the French Revolution with her own little guillotine.

41:03.221 --> 41:13.193
And the whole idea here is just kind of, you know, to point out how silly Barbie is as an icon or as a model, because these are roles real women have endured for years, and the effect is pretty funny.

41:13.274 --> 41:14.835
But the book is more than just fun.

41:15.376 --> 41:17.278
There's an underlying message here.

41:17.759 --> 41:23.626
Well, I think we have to take another look at the stereotypes put up for kids, but also for women who have been tortured by Barbie.

41:23.686 --> 41:25.148
And believe me, there are a lot of them.

41:25.465 --> 41:29.417
This gives them some relief, too, and it's their chance to get back at her.

41:29.737 --> 41:37.600
The book is called Barbie Unbound, a parody of the Barbie obsession, and it's available at local bookstores throughout New England.

41:37.620 --> 41:39.205
Oh, God bless us, everyone.

41:39.674 --> 41:44.160
I'm Dave Maynard on the other side for WBZ Newsradio, 10.30.

41:44.400 --> 41:44.981
Thank you, Dave.

41:45.101 --> 41:45.862
It's preview time.

41:45.882 --> 41:49.827
Let's check in with WBZ's Anthony Silva, see what is ahead on the WBZ afternoon news.

41:50.007 --> 41:53.051
Only Dave Maynard would ever report on Barbie with hairy legs.

41:53.352 --> 41:53.792
I've got to tell you.

41:53.912 --> 41:54.533
Thank you very much.

41:54.894 --> 41:58.899
The vice president is expected to tour some storm-ravaged areas of Maine.

41:58.939 --> 42:00.841
We'll have the very latest for you coming up.

42:00.861 --> 42:07.550
Also just ahead, the United Nations Security Council is preparing yet another statement denouncing Iraq's refusal to cooperate with those U.N.

42:07.570 --> 42:08.972
weapons inspectors.

42:08.952 --> 42:14.159
And what is the largest growing area for some Massachusetts high-tech companies?

42:14.400 --> 42:15.742
Would you believe Eastern Europe?

42:15.942 --> 42:17.424
That story coming up in New England Business.

42:17.945 --> 42:20.909
Out here on the range, a kid can get mighty hungry.

42:21.149 --> 42:25.415
Turbo-weeds are blowing, hunger's growing too.

42:25.435 --> 42:27.699
But I'm coming home on here's what I want from you.

42:27.839 --> 42:35.089
I want the blue, cross macaroni and cheese, the blue box food.

42:35.129 --> 42:36.411
Well, if mama wants to present, she's

42:36.897 --> 42:48.675
Hi, I'm David Oreck, maker of the 8-pound Oreck XL.

42:49.176 --> 42:57.589
There are over a million of my 8-pound upright shoes in the world's finest hotels, airports, offices, and home.

42:58.025 --> 43:16.843
now you can try my eight pound hotel back in your home absolutely free without obligation for 15 days or for a free brochure call the factory 1-800-989-4200 hey all you have to lose is the hidden dirt your present vacuum leaves behind call 1-800-989-4200

43:17.971 --> 43:45.109
you're listening to the 50 000 watt clear channel voice of news radio wbc boston news radio your first choice all day every day it's three o'clock 48 degrees here in boston wbc acu weather meteorologist kara schwindenhammer says for tonight a couple of flurries here clearing brisk and turning much colder lows ranging from 14 inland

43:45.089 --> 43:52.720
And tomorrow's crazy cold, sunshine, a few clouds, a high of just around 30.

43:52.740 --> 43:54.728
Tomorrow night, mainly here, early on, an increasing amount of heat with temperatures in the world.

43:57.982 --> 44:00.345
Good afternoon, I'm Anthony Solt, WBZ Ears.

44:00.705 --> 44:05.610
Well, Vice President Al Gore is expecting to tour storm-ravaged areas of Maine later this week.

44:05.630 --> 44:15.701
Maine Congressman John Balgache says the Vice President will most likely fly into Grunswick Naval Air Station on Thursday and tour the hardest-hit communities of Augusta and Lewiston.

44:15.721 --> 44:20.867
Meanwhile, utility workers up in Maine say they're making more progress getting everyone plugged back in.

44:20.847 --> 44:25.900
Central Maine Power says 122,000 customers are still without electricity.

44:26.080 --> 44:31.093
Major General Earl Adams of Maine's Emergency Management Agency is with me now.

44:31.732 --> 44:33.996
General Adams, thank you very much for joining us.

44:34.017 --> 44:34.798
Thank you.

44:34.818 --> 44:37.243
Tell me about the latest updates here.

44:37.263 --> 44:40.489
How many people remain to be plugged in, and how has the progress gone?

44:40.509 --> 44:45.119
Throughout the affected area, there's still about 135 customers that are without power.

44:45.720 --> 44:51.411
Our shelter count has dropped to about 111 shelters that are operating now, and the count in those shelters

44:51.391 --> 44:59.166
has dropped from a high of 2,800 to about 1,920 as we speak, so indicative for more and more people getting back online.

44:59.526 --> 45:05.177
Any time you think when everybody is back online, what do you think for the deadline here?

45:05.197 --> 45:14.935
The Down East area in Machias, Elton, Washington County could be a considerable time yet before they're back online, but I wouldn't dare to venture a guess as to how many days that may take.

45:15.117 --> 45:16.900
Now, what about the conditions up there?

45:16.920 --> 45:22.488
Are you still suffering some more roundouts and blackouts?

45:23.829 --> 45:25.392
Not nearly as many.

45:25.412 --> 45:30.859
We've had three or four incidents today that were caused by other things, from vehicle accidents.

45:31.300 --> 45:38.931
Of course, the weather has come in again today with some snow and some freezing rain in parts of the affected areas, which is hampering the work a little bit.

45:39.434 --> 45:40.997
Okay, sir, thank you very much.

45:41.077 --> 45:43.140
Okay, we also want to thank Massachusetts for their help.

45:43.160 --> 45:44.702
Yes, I understand we sent up a lot of units.

45:44.723 --> 45:47.968
They sent up a lot of generators up here that were a great help in our shelters.

45:48.128 --> 45:49.009
Okay, thank you very much.

45:49.029 --> 45:49.350
Thank you.

45:49.370 --> 45:57.443
That's Major General Earl Adams of Maine's Emergency Management Agency and his good neighbor, thanking Massachusetts energy companies as well.

45:57.423 --> 46:00.751
In New Hampshire, things are slowly getting back to normal after the storm.

46:01.092 --> 46:05.161
The number of people without power is dwindling, but more nasty weather could bring new problems.

46:05.482 --> 46:11.837
Less than 10,000 people are in the dark this afternoon up in New Hampshire, but the freezing rain forecast for today could cause more outages.

46:11.857 --> 46:14.503
And in Canada, more than a million Quebecers.

46:14.483 --> 46:17.209
are spending another day in the cold and in the dark.

46:17.650 --> 46:23.564
Officials are urging those still living in their frigid homes to evacuate before another wave of bitterly cold temperatures moves in tonight.

46:24.005 --> 46:27.032
It may be a while before everyone in Quebec is plugged back in.

46:27.052 --> 46:30.400
Officials say it could be another week, maybe as much as two weeks.

46:30.380 --> 46:32.342
will be busy news time, 303.

46:32.382 --> 46:36.366
Traffic on the threes, brought to you by the return of Ben and Teller at the Schubert Theater.

46:36.867 --> 46:38.729
And here's Ian Gordon again.

46:38.749 --> 46:43.033
128 southbound at Route 93 in Redding, that's the all-important cloverleaf.

46:43.053 --> 46:47.378
Three-car accident, 128 both directions are now stalled out.

46:47.418 --> 46:52.503
Route 93 northbound, also a tie-up on the ramps to 128 in Redding.

46:52.663 --> 46:56.607
As fight west out of the city, a short wait at the Alston-Brighton Falls,

46:56.587 --> 47:00.671
Memorial Drive inbound is fine to Land Boulevard.

47:00.691 --> 47:04.615
Starro Drive also with no reported incidents on your way to Leverage Circle.

47:05.015 --> 47:06.257
Tobin Bridge on the way in.

47:06.377 --> 47:08.459
Windy on the center span.

47:08.479 --> 47:11.522
Sumner Tunnel out of Logan Airport just pick a toll booth.

47:11.542 --> 47:13.324
Lower Jagger Brute 93.

47:13.444 --> 47:16.046
Artery South combination is now somewhat heavy.

47:16.407 --> 47:17.568
Expressway northbound.

47:17.588 --> 47:20.951
Congestion from the Ponson to the gas tank and again at East Berkeley Street.

47:21.352 --> 47:24.855
Central Artery northbound is heavy and slow, especially in the right lane.

47:24.835 --> 47:51.180
through the callahan we'll check it again in less than 10 minutes he and gordon wbc 24-hour traffic network they're back they're penn and teller from crazy stunts with dives and fire to brand new stuff like the amazing bullet catch penn and teller want to prove to you why the new york times calls them genius on broadway penn and teller two weeks only beginning february 3rd at the schubert theater this is joe kill the local weather guy hey joe how's the weather looking looks like great

Thanks, Joe.

47:53.191 --> 47:55.894
Amazing thing is, he's right 90% of the time.

47:56.014 --> 47:58.397
Hey, Joe, we're thinking about having a picnic later.

47:58.457 --> 47:59.518
How's it looking out there?

47:59.538 --> 48:00.219
Should clear up.

48:00.599 --> 48:01.700
Thanks, Joe.

48:01.821 --> 48:04.484
Well, there's someone else with that amazing percentage.

48:04.504 --> 48:04.984
It's Kaplan.

48:05.305 --> 48:08.528
Kaplan is the leader in preparing students for tests like the SAT.

48:08.709 --> 48:12.854
A strong SAT score will help your team get into the college of his or her choice.

48:12.874 --> 48:15.537
That's where Kaplan comes in.

48:15.557 --> 48:18.400
90% of Kaplan's students get into one of their top choice colleges.

48:18.380 --> 48:18.981
90%.

48:19.301 --> 48:20.924
And it's no wonder.

48:20.944 --> 48:25.852
Kaplan's outstanding teachers were closely suited, giving them personalized attention and support.

48:25.872 --> 48:27.955
Private tutoring is also available.

48:28.075 --> 48:33.063
So come in out of the rain and look forward to a bright future with the proven results of Kaplan.

48:33.083 --> 48:34.966
Kaplan SAP classes are forming now.

48:35.186 --> 48:36.388
So come today to enroll.

48:36.537 --> 48:38.081
1-800-CAP-TEST.

48:38.141 --> 48:40.907
That's 1-800-K-A-P-T-E-S-T.

48:41.208 --> 48:44.575
Catholic, the leader in test practice.

48:44.595 --> 48:46.139
WBZ news time now is 3.05.

48:46.179 --> 48:51.812
The UN Security Council is referring in another statement, announcing Iraq's refusal to cooperate with UN weapons inspectors.

48:51.792 --> 48:56.723
Iraq says will not allow any team headed by American Scott Ritter to do its work.

48:56.743 --> 48:58.788
Iraq believes he's a CIA spy.

48:59.069 --> 49:03.900
Meanwhile, the Clinton administration is once again weighing one option to take against Iraq.

49:04.181 --> 49:07.388
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright says the military strikes.

49:07.570 --> 49:10.015
against Iraq are still possible.

49:10.155 --> 49:17.910
It is absolutely essential that Saddam Hussein live up to his obligations and that he not be a threat to the region.

49:18.071 --> 49:23.942
And therefore, we will continue to be vigilant and determined and we do not rule out any options.

49:23.922 --> 49:32.519
Ambassador Bill Richardson says that the United States wants to resolve this dispute diplomatically, but he says they are not ruling out other options.

49:32.539 --> 49:34.864
A funeral today for Sarah Friar.

49:34.884 --> 49:42.780
On what would have been her 22nd birthday, the family and friends of Sarah back to Wayland Church to pay their last respects to the girl who vanished 12 years ago.

49:42.800 --> 49:44.243
A series of reports now on the funeral.

49:45.303 --> 50:11.205
Anthony, in the small congregational church where the service was held, a white costume rested at the foot of the altar, draped with flowers of yellow, purple, and white.

50:11.225 --> 50:14.067
It was a service that involved Sarah's friends and family, including her sister Meg, who read a poll about a message from God to all parents.

50:14.087 --> 50:15.208
I love you for a little time, a child of mine, she said.

50:15.627 --> 50:18.817
The youth allows the while she lives and long for when she's dead.

50:20.100 --> 50:24.032
It may be six or seven years or twenty-two or three.

50:24.052 --> 50:27.342
But will you till I call her back and take care of her for me?

50:27.929 --> 50:35.262
The 75-minute service was filled with tears, with emotion, at times, laughter.

50:35.282 --> 50:42.976
Laughter when Sarah's mother, Barbara, remembered a vibrant little girl, found excitement in everything.

50:42.996 --> 50:47.304
Because of the size of the small church, many of Sarah's friends listened to the service outside.

50:47.324 --> 50:50.950
I remember back in 1985, one of my stories at college was a Sarah Pryor case.

50:50.930 --> 50:54.456
A story about the search in the woods near her whaler's home.

50:54.476 --> 50:59.524
But now in 1998, the folks who helped search for her are the same folks that I covered back then.

50:59.784 --> 51:02.368
They were at the church today and whaler to say goodbye.

51:02.729 --> 51:04.131
Kathy Grunwald was one of them.

51:04.171 --> 51:07.636
She's a family friend and did in fact search for Sarah.

51:07.656 --> 51:18.253
My husband and I took part in the search where we literally held hands and combed the field north on Concord Road, north of her home.

51:19.077 --> 51:31.660
I think that those memories are vivid today because her remains found in Wayland makes us all wonder, you know, had she been here all along, what about the search that we did?

51:31.680 --> 51:37.210
And now, Grunwald says, there is somewhat of a closure, but there are still a lot of questions.

51:37.230 --> 51:40.917
There is a pure form of anger and feeling threatened.

51:40.897 --> 51:49.350
than perhaps we felt before, because now our attention can be shifted to what exactly did happen, and that's very difficult to take in right now.

51:49.370 --> 51:53.356
And if Sarah Pryor is buried today, that question still remains unanswered.

51:53.376 --> 51:56.440
Carol Lanigan, WBZ Newsradio 1030.

51:56.601 --> 51:58.503
Okay, thank you, Carol.

51:58.544 --> 51:59.986
WBZ Newsradio 1030.

52:00.006 --> 52:05.554
Now that Tom Menino has been inaugurated into the next millennium, what's his vision for the city of Boston?

52:05.737 --> 52:08.320
I'm David Bred and I find out tonight at 9 with the mayor.

52:08.481 --> 52:12.947
He joins me in studio right here on WBZ News Radio 1030.

52:13.107 --> 52:16.171

Or a man 40, a $700,000 policy.

All this for around the cost of a cup of coffee and a donut a day.

52:34.897 --> 52:38.842

WBC News time now at 310.

53:14.846 --> 53:16.267
Let's update the numbers at Wall Street.

53:16.287 --> 53:19.331
Gary Nunn standing by at the BZ Business Week Bureau.

53:19.352 --> 53:22.015
Anthony stocks continue up, bonds down, inflation...

53:22.315 --> 53:26.524
December consumer price index ticked up a notch, up 1.7% from a year ago.

53:26.945 --> 53:32.177
The subdued inflation performance does not yet reflect the impact of much lower prices for imported goods from Asia.

53:32.598 --> 53:34.282
Technology stocks especially hot today.

53:34.302 --> 53:37.489
Investors paying almost no attention to Iraq's standoff with the UN.

53:37.469 --> 53:40.913
Long-term interest rates in the bond market have moved above 5.7%.

53:41.354 --> 53:45.298
GrayOnline says passenger ticket sales were up more than 7% last month.

53:45.318 --> 53:47.761
Passenger miles for December up almost 4.5%.

53:48.542 --> 53:49.463

Mr. Magoo has always been a favorite of mine and many others of the short animated film department, with that famed Bacchus voice, the squid, the endless trap falls, which the nearsighted Mrs. Magoo always survives with.

Don't waste your money.

56:54.160 --> 56:58.791

You're talking about U.S.
