They don't, you know.

03:11.714 --> 03:13.496
I guess you signed the same thing, you know.

03:13.516 --> 03:19.785
My wife, when I told her about you and this collection, and... Oh, keep talking.

03:19.825 --> 03:20.786
Nick, can I forget this?

03:21.988 --> 03:22.729
You got to sign this.

03:23.110 --> 03:23.911
You want me to sign it?

03:24.512 --> 03:25.273
You better sign it.

03:27.335 --> 03:28.617
I'll be honored.

03:28.637 --> 03:29.879
May I have a good chance?

03:29.979 --> 03:30.600
I need a good chance.

03:30.660 --> 03:32.943
Well, whatever you want, one of these or whatever, you know.

03:33.023 --> 03:33.945
Keep talking about your wife.

03:33.965 --> 03:34.405
I'm sorry.

03:34.666 --> 03:39.572
I just told her about the collection, and she is very envious.

03:39.592 --> 03:41.535
She's been with me on a lot of the research.

03:41.870 --> 03:48.377
This is a special person.

03:48.657 --> 03:49.699
He's 98 years old.

03:49.719 --> 03:54.864
I mean, he came into my life, you know, I mean, and he's still living today.

03:55.084 --> 04:03.934
This is what I'm saying, my first start off, I didn't know where my collection would take me, but I just went along with the flow.

04:04.555 --> 04:11.202
And then later, I always remember, I guess, even before the book came out, when it came out, I was thrilled to read it.

04:12.430 --> 04:22.025
of the passage from Jonathan Livingston Segal where it said, it's good to become a collector, for sooner or later you must give what you have unto the world who would have accepted.

04:22.646 --> 04:25.010
Jonathan Livingston Segal, yeah.

04:25.170 --> 04:26.151
About collecting?

04:26.292 --> 04:34.945
Yeah, it's like, it's good to be a searcher, but sooner or later you must become a finer, and then it is well to give what you have found

04:35.195 --> 04:37.277
unto the world who would ever receive it.

04:37.477 --> 04:37.858
That's wonderful.

04:37.978 --> 04:41.081
This is what I, it's like a, it's a guide collection.

04:41.101 --> 04:43.463
Yeah, it's one of the passages, one of my favorite passages, yeah.

04:43.483 --> 04:44.564
Well, that's pretty darn good.

04:44.604 --> 04:44.905
Yeah.

04:45.385 --> 04:46.366
I mean, I'm impressed.

04:46.406 --> 04:48.508
I didn't think that it had that in them.

04:48.528 --> 04:49.549
Yes, I have a matter of fact.

04:49.610 --> 04:50.851
People used to make fun of that.

04:51.271 --> 04:57.698
I know, but I have it in my, in my, in my bathroom on the wall, you know, I mean, as a reminder, you know.

04:58.258 --> 05:01.962
What my collecting is, I've given what I have found,

05:02.633 --> 05:04.215
into the world, whoever would accept it.

05:04.415 --> 05:05.356
You pass it on.

05:05.877 --> 05:11.063
Knowledge was passed on to me, like you're talking about Rosenbach, Rosenwald, and all of the collectors, you know.

05:11.444 --> 05:16.930
Now here, your collection is going to join this massive, you know, and you get... It's an honor.

05:16.950 --> 05:19.493
You know, I'm so proud.

05:19.854 --> 05:21.175
And you know what pleases me?

05:21.676 --> 05:24.600
They were timid when they were asking me about this.

05:25.100 --> 05:26.242
And I said, are you kidding?

05:26.522 --> 05:30.767
I've got thousands of pages of manuscripts, of transcripts,

05:31.000 --> 05:59.100
which i will only realistically be able to use four or five percent in my book the thought that this stuff is going to have another life yes that's what it's all about somebody can go there and i'll start it ed wolf died some of the people i met a lot of people along the way and one of the women that uh i owe a lot of respect for ellen shaper from formerly of the free library of philadelphia who uh nominated me for the um

05:59.266 --> 06:01.148
Bibliographical Society of America.

06:01.689 --> 06:02.590
She recognized my name.

06:02.610 --> 06:08.596
She also asked me so that I was able to participate in the Bibliographical Society.

06:08.676 --> 06:11.699
It was through Ellen Schafer encouragement.

06:13.501 --> 06:15.263
We had a book.

06:15.343 --> 06:24.072
She asked me to have an exhibition on black books at the Free Library shortly two years, a year before she left to go out to California.

06:24.553 --> 06:27.636
It was called Books by Blacks at the main library.

06:27.903 --> 06:30.105
And ever since then, I had about four other exhibitions.

06:30.125 --> 06:33.549
We had a great one from Marian Anderson last year.

06:33.589 --> 06:41.978
I learned to appreciate the different types of unique people in the world of books.

06:42.119 --> 06:43.520
Of course, I knew Edwin Wolfe.

06:44.021 --> 06:55.193
I give him credit in the book here when he encouraged me to do a black 100, as you call it, 101 books by black.

06:55.426 --> 07:03.376
You know, back in 1977, he said, Charles, why don't you do a book about 100 books that afforded black history?

07:03.396 --> 07:11.427
So I just took it to tell us years later, 1989, and there's this book, and I gave it to Mr. Wilson, and also Leslie Rosenwald.

07:11.887 --> 07:18.115
I was able to see a month before he died, and I asked him about an idea of doing a book.

07:18.135 --> 07:21.079
He said, a book of this nature, no...

07:21.143 --> 07:25.027
more or less for stimulating interest to become a well-soyed item.

07:25.067 --> 07:28.711
So I had the influence of several great men, Hal Heaney.

07:28.731 --> 07:34.136
Lessing Rosenwald, by the way, Greg, and that hasn't heard his name yet because he's deceased.

07:34.276 --> 07:34.517
Yes.

07:34.557 --> 07:35.998
But he very much is in my book.

07:36.619 --> 07:38.601
I have his book, Recollections of a Collector.

07:38.961 --> 07:39.642
Well, I want that.

07:39.682 --> 07:40.763
I've been looking for that book.

07:40.803 --> 07:41.664
McManus has one.

07:42.264 --> 07:42.705
Show him.

07:42.845 --> 07:43.486
He sent me a card.

07:43.506 --> 07:44.206
You gave me Clarence?

07:44.647 --> 07:45.007
Yeah.

07:45.047 --> 07:45.848
How much do you want for it?

07:46.248 --> 07:46.889
A couple hundred.

07:49.031 --> 07:50.813
Wait, am I going to call Clarence?

07:51.181 --> 07:57.146
He sent me a card, and I meanwhile got another copy of it from somebody else, from Bob Fleck got me a copy.

07:57.166 --> 07:58.147
Yeah, for 200?

07:59.048 --> 08:01.050
He quoted it to me for 200.

08:01.190 --> 08:02.531
It's really good, isn't it?

08:04.493 --> 08:07.035
I'm glad that you told me that.

08:07.055 --> 08:20.968
You know, but meeting people like Edward Wolfe and Hal Heaney, he used to be the librarian for Thomas Freeder, you know, he had this free library after, well, Alan Schaefer was there, but Hal Heaney,

08:21.252 --> 08:22.053
around here.

08:22.093 --> 08:26.100
It was like a mecca for collectors.

08:26.581 --> 08:38.541
It's a part, even the black collectors, the Robert Adgers and the Adelman, and I knew Robert Pervis.

08:38.561 --> 08:47.496
In other words, on the black side, where most of the white collectors were collecting because it was the magnificent diversion.

08:47.695 --> 09:01.367
The black collectors who started here, you know, I didn't realize later until I was living in a city, although I was coming from my hometown, Norristown, 18 miles away into the city, I was fell bound to know that there were black people here.

09:01.387 --> 09:16.420
The hub of book collecting in America, black America, started here in the city of Philadelphia when I heard the name of Robert Adger, A-D-G-E-R, and William Dorsey, and Leon Gardner.

09:16.670 --> 09:17.771
and people like that.

09:17.831 --> 09:23.757
And I said, on the other hand, I heard of Roosevelt and, you know, and Wolfe and others.

09:24.177 --> 09:26.540
I mean, Ed Newton.

09:26.820 --> 09:30.423
Edward Newton lived in the main line.

09:30.964 --> 09:31.264
Yes.

09:31.364 --> 09:35.668
And the one who wrote the, you know, in the bookstore.

09:35.688 --> 09:36.529
I mean, the great writer.

09:36.569 --> 09:37.991
I mean, Christopher Wallow.

09:38.231 --> 09:39.452
I mean, all these collectors.

09:39.472 --> 09:42.935
In other words, I was in the middle on both sides.

09:42.955 --> 09:43.656
I was surrounded.

09:44.159 --> 09:49.086
is that once I start to read books about books, I have a small collection of books about books.

09:49.386 --> 09:53.291
I'm also drawn to writers of the 1920s.

09:53.492 --> 10:00.281
I hate to call them expatriates, but people, Americans who lived abroad, you know, during the 20s.

10:00.361 --> 10:09.554
I was always into the, you know, the writing besides the Hemingway, but some of the black writers in Europe and that whole period of the Great Gatsby.

10:10.235 --> 10:12.057
I'm drawn to people like Nancy Kennard,

10:12.323 --> 10:16.527
I have her monumental book, Negro, that she did in 1934.

10:16.887 --> 10:18.128
She wasn't bipolar, was she?

10:18.148 --> 10:23.033
No, she was white, but she had a profound influence.

10:23.053 --> 10:28.819
I have Paul Robeson's copy of $3,000 I paid for it.

10:28.859 --> 10:32.562
I searched the book for five years, six years, and I finally got it.

10:33.002 --> 10:38.888
His personal copy of Nancy Canard's book, Negro, that she did on the H.A.R., H.A.R., H.A.R., Press,

10:39.222 --> 10:46.522
to prove the fact to her mother and other members of nobility that African people of African descent had in history.

10:46.783 --> 10:47.565
So I had that.

10:47.805 --> 10:51.696
And I was drawn, then I started to, in other words, as I

10:52.469 --> 11:18.647
with my books of the 20s, like, you know, like, what's her name, the Crosby's, and the Kate Boyle, and all those people, and Bernard Shaw, and the one, Ulysses, and all, but see, I, James, James, when Robeson went there in 1930, I began to realize that many of the books that were written by, say, some of the white writers did not mention these black friends of these people.

11:18.687 --> 11:19.708
Then I realized that

11:19.942 --> 11:23.426
All these great minds, they met together at parties and so forth.

11:23.486 --> 11:28.853
And then some people would talk about their black friends in Europe at the same time, the same party.

11:29.173 --> 11:33.679
And Carl Van Vechten in New York City, his great parties and so forth.

11:33.699 --> 11:41.568
So when I took the A train to Harlem and, you know, following Duke Ellington was my first time going to Harlem, you know.

11:43.170 --> 11:44.492
So I went up alone.

11:44.592 --> 11:47.215
I went up in the car, you know, a couple of times.

11:47.667 --> 11:50.250
I was in my greatest pool in New York.

11:50.730 --> 11:54.574
Whenever I went to New York, I was more or less always.

11:55.275 --> 11:57.337
I would go to two places.

11:58.018 --> 11:58.979
One, Granny's Village.

11:59.639 --> 12:01.822
I was always drawn to Granny's Village, even in high school.

12:02.282 --> 12:03.804
Then secondly, Harlem.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.806
Granny's Village for the coffee houses.

12:05.826 --> 12:15.936
I have this awkward card side in the jazz and the arts, you know, and the bookstores and all that, you know, the coffee houses.

12:16.220 --> 12:22.989
especially when in the 60s and late 50s, you know, the corner of McDougal, Bleigo, Brienzes and all those places.

12:23.009 --> 12:25.212
But they had all those bookstores in the village.

12:25.232 --> 12:26.634
Then I would go up to Harlem.

12:27.195 --> 12:30.700
I would go to Mr. Lewis McShaw.

12:30.720 --> 12:31.561
I have to get to the name.

12:31.861 --> 12:32.743
I'll find it.

12:32.763 --> 12:34.886
M-I-C-H-E-A-U-X, I think it is.

12:34.986 --> 12:37.489
Oh, I've seen the name.

12:37.850 --> 12:39.612
Yeah, Lewis McShaw, who had his

12:39.862 --> 12:44.310
The National Memorial Bookstore in Harlem, but I think I sent you information on that.

12:44.410 --> 12:44.991
Yeah, I've got that.

12:45.052 --> 12:46.134
We're all these great people.

12:46.174 --> 12:47.476
I met Malcolm X there.

12:47.516 --> 12:50.862
You know, Mr. Michaud introduced me to Malcolm X. I met a lot of the writers.

12:50.882 --> 12:52.105
I met Langston Hughes there.

12:52.525 --> 12:55.010
Then I began to meet writers.

12:55.050 --> 12:57.735
Now I'm called...

12:58.002 --> 13:00.885
Well, the premier collector, I mean, from my A class.

13:00.905 --> 13:01.686
I started so young.

13:01.726 --> 13:03.087
I picked you out of that book.

13:03.107 --> 13:04.048
Yeah, but I started so young.

13:04.068 --> 13:05.350
This is the number one guy, right?

13:05.410 --> 13:07.812
Nick, I didn't look at it that way.

13:07.892 --> 13:09.854
I picked you as the first team.

13:09.874 --> 13:10.395
No kidding.

13:10.535 --> 13:11.476
Oh, yeah.

13:11.496 --> 13:14.119
I said, this is the guy I got to see.

13:14.199 --> 13:15.140
I can't do all of them.

13:15.160 --> 13:16.381
No, no, no.

13:16.561 --> 13:18.423
And that's one thing that my publishers like.

13:18.443 --> 13:22.307
I'm not trying to do a survey of every important book collector.

13:22.688 --> 13:23.308
That's boring.

13:24.009 --> 13:25.090
You know, I want to tell a nice story.

13:25.643 --> 13:26.984
grouping of stories.

13:27.224 --> 13:29.066
Well, is there any other thing that I have missed?

13:29.326 --> 13:36.312
Yeah, there are a few things, and then I'll... I'm driving back today, and I know you're tired, too.

13:36.332 --> 13:37.994
I have to go to one meeting or two.

13:38.054 --> 13:40.977
Okay, so we can do... I think we can wrap it up in ten minutes.

13:41.117 --> 13:41.517
Yeah, go ahead.

13:41.537 --> 13:42.198
That's fine, yeah.

13:42.398 --> 13:43.239
But two things.

13:43.259 --> 13:49.144
Number one, it's very interesting that this is a collection that is still growing.

13:49.804 --> 13:53.828
This is not a collection that you turned over to Temple, and here it is, Temple,

13:54.213 --> 13:58.219
You also have come in, and you're still building the collection.

13:58.239 --> 13:58.439
Yes, I am.

13:58.740 --> 14:01.043
It is an evolving, organic collection.

14:01.204 --> 14:04.349
Plus, I have an auxiliary collection I've kept for myself.

14:04.369 --> 14:04.829
What's that?

14:04.849 --> 14:06.512
You mean auxiliary collection?

14:06.532 --> 14:06.832
I know.

14:06.852 --> 14:08.255
I'm curious, so I'm smiling.

14:08.815 --> 14:22.296
Well, I don't say too much about it, but, you know, when I started collecting, there were so many duplicates, you know, books like Zora, Z-O-R-A-N-E-A-L-E, Hurston, H-U-R-T-O-N,

14:22.276 --> 14:26.081
She's very popular now, but I used to give away books.

14:26.141 --> 14:28.444
I have a habit of giving away Christmas.

14:28.564 --> 14:51.253
People who love books, I mean, I cannot go to a flea market or a bookstore to see a book that I could afford a remainder and not, you know, but I get them because I just hate to see black books, but I get them, and people who love books, I do, but all going aside, I always, I had this duplicates before I kept my other collection in a garage that I had.

14:51.790 --> 14:54.292
You know, I donated that.

14:54.352 --> 14:57.015
I mean, I could exist without books.

14:57.135 --> 14:58.716
I mean, they're my soul.

14:59.077 --> 15:02.980
So I donated this sign, but I have my auxiliary collection also.

15:03.260 --> 15:05.442
What is the auxiliary collection?

15:05.462 --> 15:05.963
Duplicates?

15:06.523 --> 15:08.465
Well, not quite duplicates.

15:08.485 --> 15:11.087
Some of them are duplicates, but other things I've been buying.

15:11.468 --> 15:16.332
I've been going here almost nine years, but I've been buying, I think, at a flea market.

15:16.392 --> 15:17.753
I've donated to Temple.

15:18.094 --> 15:20.015
It's something that I think should be in here.

15:20.035 --> 15:21.797
I put in here, but I always...

15:22.267 --> 15:24.370
I always had the personal collective.

15:24.410 --> 15:28.676
I had, you know— You're starting to tell me exactly what the focus is of the exhibit in the literary collection.

15:28.796 --> 15:32.021
It's the same focus.

15:32.041 --> 15:35.346
I collect the whole—I mean, it's more—no, I must repeat.

15:35.686 --> 15:36.367
It's narrow.

15:36.387 --> 15:38.190
I mean, I have to simplify it more.

15:38.490 --> 15:42.456
It's books that I feel that I want to read, because I read a lot, you know?

15:42.516 --> 15:45.580
I mean— One of my guys, one of my collectors is Chef Zafmari.

15:45.600 --> 15:46.241
You ever heard of him?

15:46.301 --> 15:48.444
No, you name— Chef Louis Zafmari.

15:48.464 --> 15:49.045
Oh, my.

15:49.085 --> 15:50.427
He's a Hungarian immigrant.

15:50.608 --> 15:50.908
Uh-huh.

15:50.928 --> 15:51.649
He came here.

15:52.135 --> 16:01.344
And he went and he built a wonderful, looks like a walrus with a big chef's hat, big mustache, and he speaks with a Hungarian accent.

16:01.624 --> 16:06.889
And he put together the finest culinary collection in the world, one of them is the finest.

16:06.909 --> 16:09.171
And he just gave it to the University of Iowa.

16:09.191 --> 16:11.453
He put together the finest Hungarian collection.

16:11.493 --> 16:13.595
He just gave that to the University of Chicago.

16:14.055 --> 16:16.057
He had Brahms and Beethoven stuff.

16:16.077 --> 16:18.419
He gave that to, where did he give that?

16:18.459 --> 16:20.201
Some of that went to Boston University.

16:20.221 --> 16:21.282
And he just gave a bunch of

16:21.599 --> 16:33.114
cooking artifacts, a million things, like, and that don't transcribe all the menus and things, a million things, to this university in Providence, Johnson and Wales.

16:33.134 --> 16:34.536
I know what it is, yes.

16:34.556 --> 16:36.759
And, but he talks, and I said, have you given everything?

16:36.779 --> 16:40.925
And he said, yes, I'm glad, he said, I kept a few for myself.

16:40.945 --> 16:42.487
The point is that I smile.

16:42.747 --> 16:50.357
I said, every collector, Thomas Jefferson, he said, of course, Thomas Jefferson, the day after he gave his books, the day, I mean,

16:50.675 --> 16:56.581
to the Library of Congress when he sold them, he started building the next library, which became Charlottesville.

16:57.002 --> 16:57.903
That's right.

16:57.943 --> 17:03.108
The day after Jerome Curran sold his books in 1929, he was out the next day buying books.

17:03.249 --> 17:07.713
It's a crutch instinct, isn't it?

17:07.733 --> 17:10.036
Well, I mean, you know, it's wonderful.

17:10.797 --> 17:11.538
It's in our blood.

17:11.678 --> 17:12.759
Yes.

17:13.319 --> 17:15.442
And the thing of it is, it's not inherited.

17:15.482 --> 17:17.544
I don't think that it goes on from generation.

17:17.564 --> 17:19.466
It is innate.

17:20.087 --> 17:20.327
It's innate.

17:20.628 --> 17:21.109
You're right.

17:22.050 --> 17:26.135
Because what's the first thing so many children do when the old man dies?

17:26.395 --> 17:26.956
Sell it.

17:26.976 --> 17:27.677
Sell the things.

17:27.837 --> 17:28.458
Yes.

17:28.698 --> 17:29.719
That's his worth money.

17:29.739 --> 17:30.040
Yes.

17:30.160 --> 17:30.941
You know, most often.

17:30.961 --> 17:31.241
Yes.

17:31.261 --> 17:34.044
You have Bill Scheide, who's the third generation.

17:34.085 --> 17:35.306
I've interviewed Bill Scheide.

17:35.787 --> 17:37.469
He held his Gutenberg Bible.

17:37.569 --> 17:37.969
Oh, man.

17:37.989 --> 17:40.733
Well, see, I can't wait for this book, you know.

17:40.813 --> 17:41.934
And it's not just collectors.

17:42.134 --> 17:44.577
It's people like Ellen Schaefer, Eddie Wolfe.

17:44.597 --> 17:45.378
It's book people.

17:45.819 --> 17:46.720
It's book sellers.

17:46.902 --> 17:49.264
I've been to all the major institutions.

17:49.405 --> 17:52.748
I've been into the vaults at the Newbury.

17:52.768 --> 17:53.669
I've helped Caxton.

17:53.869 --> 17:54.590
Oh, man.

17:55.251 --> 17:57.072
You've been to Bae Sambuk?

17:57.293 --> 17:58.794
I've handled Bae Sambuk.

17:58.874 --> 18:01.697
I've handled Chamberlain, Food Chamberlain.

18:01.777 --> 18:04.640
I've been in the vaults at Houghton Library.

18:04.660 --> 18:05.221
Oh, good.

18:05.241 --> 18:09.025
You know, she's called you.

18:09.105 --> 18:12.769
She's going something on the slave trade in Cuba for a dissertation.

18:12.809 --> 18:16.032
Sometimes here is like,

18:16.670 --> 18:21.574
I have to answer about 20, 40, 50, Black History Month.

18:21.594 --> 18:25.938
It's like some of the 25 questions, you know, within two or three hours.

18:26.158 --> 18:45.816
My mind, what I'm saying, another reason that I'm glad I started reading what I did, when people come in here to ask questions, which the libraries don't know or whatever, they come to me, although I've collected in literature, poetry, the Caribbean, Africa,

18:46.201 --> 18:48.624
slave diaries, military.

18:49.905 --> 18:52.168
When people call me, they call from all over the world.

18:52.288 --> 18:57.394
I have them, people say, have you read all your books?

18:57.414 --> 18:58.235
I mean, you had that too.

18:58.255 --> 19:00.217
I said, no, I haven't read all these books.

19:00.678 --> 19:04.723
I've collected, as a collector, I know what's in all these books.

19:04.743 --> 19:12.732
Winston Churchill, Winston Churchill said, a gentleman does not have to have, should not be expected to read all his books.

19:13.015 --> 19:16.239
He should be expected to know what he has and how it can help him.

19:16.379 --> 19:17.080
That's right.

19:17.140 --> 19:22.046
What he has, where he can find it, and when he needs it, and how it can help him.

19:22.146 --> 19:23.688
And that's how I look at my library.

19:24.089 --> 19:28.494
If all of a sudden I'm writing a story about Clarence Darrow, I've got a biography of him.

19:28.635 --> 19:30.777
I haven't read it, but I will quick enough.

19:30.797 --> 19:31.839
But you know where it is.

19:31.859 --> 19:34.882
And I know where to grab it, you know, and it's there for my use.

19:35.283 --> 19:39.128
But also here, Nick, how can anybody read 80,000 books?

19:39.148 --> 19:40.930
You can't do it, but the thing about...

19:41.129 --> 19:43.572
People say, you have a photographic mind, but I love books.

19:43.913 --> 19:45.334
Books are drawn to me, as I said.

19:45.775 --> 19:51.823
But my thing here, 97% of the people who come here, I can help.

19:52.644 --> 19:53.525
I have information.

19:53.825 --> 19:56.349
The others, I can tell them where to go.

19:56.869 --> 19:58.732
People say, you're a good research person.

20:00.554 --> 20:01.636
I can tell them books.

20:01.716 --> 20:03.678
I know libraries, books, and so forth.

20:03.698 --> 20:05.521
So then the other percent, I can help.

20:06.021 --> 20:08.725
See, you are as much a resource as your books.

20:08.925 --> 20:09.546
Yes.

20:09.566 --> 20:10.427
It's coming to me now.

20:11.048 --> 20:12.350
It's just being circled.

20:12.370 --> 20:12.711
Yes.

20:12.731 --> 20:14.233
Remember, did I show you that article?

20:14.253 --> 20:19.902
I don't know if I showed you this one here.

20:19.922 --> 20:22.125
I forgot.

20:22.145 --> 20:26.452
I can't give you this one, didn't I?

20:26.552 --> 20:26.712
No.

20:26.732 --> 20:27.133
I'll take that.

20:27.153 --> 20:28.195
This article will tell you.

20:28.295 --> 20:28.555
Okay.

20:28.635 --> 20:30.037
One other thing, and then I'm on my way.

20:30.618 --> 20:32.041
This is a dream job for you.

20:32.281 --> 20:33.483
This is not even a job.

20:34.024 --> 20:34.324
No.

20:34.384 --> 20:37.870
What you have here, what temple... It's good for my soul.

20:38.010 --> 20:39.452
But I mean, here you are.

20:40.580 --> 20:44.284
working at something that's your life.

20:44.324 --> 20:44.705
My life.

20:45.205 --> 20:46.207
My books are my life.

20:46.447 --> 20:50.011
But to be able to temple also, this has been a dream for you, hasn't it?

20:50.031 --> 20:55.618
Yes, and like people said, it's been a dream for a temple, because the temple's located in an urban community.

20:55.778 --> 20:56.999
And you wanted that, too, didn't you?

20:57.019 --> 21:10.435
Yeah, people, I mean, you remember, I said in my thing, the reason I wanted the access for people from all races, creeds, and colors, you know, it's in an eastern, northeastern corridor between Washington and New York, and so forth, and it's like...

21:11.393 --> 21:14.558
In Boston, you know.

21:14.618 --> 21:16.401
Pittsburgh, Philly.

21:16.561 --> 21:18.545
Yes.

21:18.605 --> 21:23.593
And the university, I mean, they have been generous with me as far as supporting me and so forth.

21:23.613 --> 21:29.963
And the president of the university, I would say, Peter Lee, of course, is my number one fan, you know.

21:30.945 --> 21:32.387
Can you spell his name for my name?

21:32.467 --> 21:34.350
Oh, here we go with Peter's name.

21:35.031 --> 21:38.076
I've got it in it, I'll get it.

21:38.478 --> 21:43.343
But you'll have to, like, I'm surrounded by Greeks here, you, and Italian.

21:43.363 --> 21:44.064
I-X-U-U-R-S, I'm sure.

21:44.084 --> 21:46.086
Yeah.

21:46.546 --> 21:47.887
He wrote something in here, too.

21:48.888 --> 21:49.769
A statement in the book.

21:50.970 --> 21:51.471
One quote.

21:52.432 --> 21:54.874
Did you want to see that one in this book that he said?

21:55.255 --> 21:56.116
Okay.

21:56.136 --> 21:56.696
What else, Nick?

21:56.716 --> 22:05.565
You were saying something else you wanted to... Just the fact that this position, this setup with Temple is a...

22:06.389 --> 22:10.414
Yeah, it's something that I created, you know, I mean, there's many places that wanted to come.

22:10.434 --> 22:11.875
Did Temple propose this to you?

22:11.895 --> 22:16.400
No, it was like they wanted me back in 73 when the other library was here.

22:16.420 --> 22:17.341
There was, like, pressure.

22:17.582 --> 22:20.665
There was a lot of controversy here at the university before I came here.

22:21.186 --> 22:26.311
As a result from the question being here, we have the first African-American doctoral program.

22:26.452 --> 22:30.296
You mean pressure on the university to become more involved with the community?

22:30.396 --> 22:30.476
Yes.

22:30.496 --> 22:34.641
They need an urban... Yes, they had it before, but they couldn't for the last 18 years ago.

22:34.661 --> 22:35.822
I mean, 15 years ago.

22:36.005 --> 22:40.511
They had controversy with black study programs involved.

22:40.531 --> 22:42.274
I do have to type with Peter.

22:42.574 --> 22:45.438
Yeah.

22:45.478 --> 22:47.040
In that way, he'll tell you more.

22:47.160 --> 22:55.231
But this collection, as a result, we have a Center for African Americans.

22:55.712 --> 22:59.657
Don't worry about it.

23:00.078 --> 23:01.540
Don't get it.

23:05.468 --> 23:17.122
As I said, I mean, going back to my early days when I was a child, before as a minister, then archaeologist, historian, it's like, it's all combined, you know.

23:18.704 --> 23:31.019
I guess I represent the, you know, the characters in the, in Chaucer, you know, the one with the, with the minister, with the minister?

23:31.520 --> 23:35.104
The partner, the partner, yeah, and the teacher.

23:35.540 --> 23:39.905
The one with, what was the quote I was going to use?

23:40.146 --> 23:51.279
The one, I have the quote, and I can't think, where he teaches and the other preachers, you know, I mean, the Canterbury Tales were always one of my favorites, you know.

23:51.679 --> 23:57.707
And oftentimes I go back, you know, and read them, because a lot come out of it, you know.

23:58.588 --> 24:02.032
Even the erotic book, I wrote a chapter in this book on erotica.

24:02.272 --> 24:05.496
My book is called, my chapter in the book is called

24:05.813 --> 24:10.219
African-American Erotica and Other Curiosities.

24:10.240 --> 24:14.346
The subtitle, The Black of the Berry, the Sweet of the Juice.

24:14.506 --> 24:16.529
Black of the Berry, the Sweet of the Juice.

24:16.549 --> 24:18.171
Which is all folks say from black people.

24:18.231 --> 24:21.636
The Black of the Berry, the Sweet of the Juice.

24:21.656 --> 24:26.644
And the subtitle, the title is African-American Erotica and Other Curiosities.

24:26.664 --> 24:28.346
And where did I get the other curiosities from?

24:28.847 --> 24:31.491
You see in the book catalog, Curioso.

24:32.252 --> 24:34.335
So therefore, I trace

24:34.889 --> 24:44.562
the history of black books of African American erotica from Alpha Ben, this woman who wrote the famous book on Oroko in 1600.

24:45.082 --> 24:47.285
You know, I tell the people, where did you get the information?

24:47.305 --> 24:48.467
I got it through reading.

24:48.507 --> 24:51.171
They said, well, you have opened up a new life.

24:51.952 --> 24:54.655
I said, well, people could start collecting erotic black.

24:54.675 --> 24:56.878
It's scholarly, from scholarly all the way down.

24:56.898 --> 25:00.663
I speak in the Hottentot Woman, for instance.

25:00.683 --> 25:03.647
You know the Hottentot Woman, the origin of the Hottentot Woman?

25:04.133 --> 25:07.757
The origin of, you know, the bustle, the bustle, the women used the bustle.

25:08.578 --> 25:10.060
B-U-S-T-L-E.

25:10.260 --> 25:21.473
Well, the bustle, the idea came when the English colonization people among who colonized, you know, Africa, they brought the Hottentop woman over from South Africa.

25:21.533 --> 25:24.437
She had those big, wide buttocks and thighs.

25:24.837 --> 25:26.519
When she walked, you know, she wobbled.

25:26.539 --> 25:30.664
She was a thin waist, you know, that she was...

25:31.083 --> 25:39.333
They were, the men were so excited over her, they displayed her in Europe, in England, and so forth, and the women became jealous.

25:40.234 --> 25:43.157
So the women create the bustle, you know, the bustle?

25:43.578 --> 25:47.843
Because when you see the walking of the bustle, it comes from the hot and hot woman in Africa.

25:48.443 --> 25:49.504
They call it the bustle.

25:49.805 --> 25:55.652
So, I mean, what I'm saying to you is that from these things, you know, one thing you learn another.

25:55.692 --> 26:00.297
So I bring it all the way down in my chapter to Chester Hine and even, um,

26:00.479 --> 26:05.811
Samuel Delany is a noted African-American science fiction writer.

26:06.131 --> 26:10.461
But he also wrote a science fiction book on erotica, the base of erotica.

26:10.621 --> 26:20.783
So what I'm saying to you, as a collector, and you as a collector, some collectors are narrow-minded, I must, I'm glad I have an open mind, because as a result,

26:21.286 --> 26:27.695
In collecting, I'm able to satisfy so many people coming home in many, many areas, you know, from children books I have.

26:28.316 --> 26:32.281
You see, there are so many collectors who won't let anybody see anything.

26:32.822 --> 26:33.142
I know.

26:33.223 --> 26:34.064
I couldn't be that way.

26:34.084 --> 26:39.371
You know, Folger, I mean, for years he wouldn't let people look at his folios.

26:39.912 --> 26:41.154
What about Sir Thomas Philip?

26:41.394 --> 26:42.315
I thought he was crazy.

26:42.495 --> 26:42.776
Yes.

26:42.896 --> 26:44.598
Yes.

26:44.618 --> 26:46.341
But what about some of the women collectors?

26:46.541 --> 26:47.863
I've tried and found a couple.

26:48.163 --> 26:48.904
What about Ruth Adamite?

26:48.944 --> 26:49.946
You're going to see her, too?

26:50.727 --> 26:50.787
No.

26:51.290 --> 26:52.672
You mean Adamite.

26:53.133 --> 26:55.337
She's the one in Cleveland who has the miniature collection.

26:57.100 --> 26:57.801
I'm supposed to go.

26:57.861 --> 26:59.344
Everybody says I should go to Cleveland.

26:59.885 --> 27:00.045
Ms.

27:00.105 --> 27:02.088
Ruth, I mean Ruth Adamite.

27:02.369 --> 27:03.190
H-E-A-N-I-T-E-A.

27:03.230 --> 27:04.392
Yeah, Adamite.

27:04.412 --> 27:05.134
She's in Cleveland.

27:05.995 --> 27:08.279
You're not the first one to tell me about her.

27:08.299 --> 27:09.301
No.

27:09.401 --> 27:10.703
I spoke at the Roe File Club.

27:10.723 --> 27:11.184
You know that?

27:11.284 --> 27:11.504
Yeah.

27:11.945 --> 27:12.787
Bill Moffat.

27:12.807 --> 27:14.209
You know Bill out at the Huntington?

27:14.408 --> 27:15.790
No, I don't think I know.

27:15.970 --> 27:16.510
He's the guy.

27:16.530 --> 27:17.852
He says, Nick, you've got to go to Cleveland.

27:17.872 --> 27:19.794
He needs to go over at the Huntington Library.

27:19.814 --> 27:22.277
But you should go to the Row Fund Club, you know.

27:22.357 --> 27:24.480
And I had the opportunity to speak in there.

27:24.500 --> 27:26.682
As a matter of fact, they gave me the history of the book.

27:27.283 --> 27:30.747
I was the second black speaker, Charles W. Chestlett.

27:30.787 --> 27:31.928
All the Chestlett books are there.

27:32.409 --> 27:33.330
He was a member of it.

27:33.790 --> 27:40.758
And I got into the Row Fund Club, you know, through Miss Bruce Adamite and her connection.

27:41.199 --> 27:42.320
Bill Moffat mentioned her.

27:42.480 --> 27:44.162
And she knows Ellen Schaefer.

27:44.817 --> 27:50.133
You know, you have the... Yeah, she must be up in age, but she... Gotta be Cleveland.

27:50.474 --> 27:53.342
Yeah, you didn't even call her, Nick, because she doesn't...

27:54.554 --> 28:01.460
I think she said at the time she could dedicate her book to Radcliffe or one of those Seven Sisters schools, Smiths or whatever, you know.

28:01.480 --> 28:02.601
Bryn Mawr Bassett.

28:03.082 --> 28:05.344
New England is the one that she's going to do.

28:05.384 --> 28:07.926
Mount Holyoke, maybe?

28:08.006 --> 28:09.488
I think it was Smith College, I think she said.

28:09.508 --> 28:10.749
Smith was out in Western Mass.

28:10.809 --> 28:13.351
Yeah, I think she was out there.

28:13.371 --> 28:17.255
Probably because Ruth Mortimer is there at Smith and she's a crackerjack.

28:17.335 --> 28:19.276
Maybe that's what it is, yeah.

28:19.497 --> 28:21.879
Ruth is very good at getting stuff.

28:21.899 --> 28:22.600
No kidding.

28:23.060 --> 28:23.160
Yeah.

28:23.478 --> 28:27.129
Well, I think I better— I've got to hustle.

28:27.149 --> 28:28.754
I'm going to work out what you're going on.

28:28.774 --> 28:29.356
I just can't.

28:29.456 --> 28:32.104
Thank you.
