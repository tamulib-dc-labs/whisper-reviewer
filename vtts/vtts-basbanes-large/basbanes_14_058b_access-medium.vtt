00:01.651 --> 00:29.042
The universities saw the opportunity for using this technology for improved undergraduate education, relief for the costs associated with traditional library services,

00:29.562 --> 00:57.882
the spiraling cost of cereal purchases, an inability to collect everything that is necessary at one physical site, and to share access to material via digital technology, rather than owning everything, you're providing enhanced access to things through consortial or cooperative relationships.

00:58.840 --> 01:04.410
a move away from the printed book, do you think?

01:04.430 --> 01:15.870
Prospectively, I think it does represent a parallel environment in which there are options for the way you use material.

01:16.671 --> 01:22.722
Books are created in electronic form, they are printed for use, but they can also be

01:23.242 --> 01:32.032
printed downstream by, you know, they don't have to be centralized in the production process.

01:32.433 --> 01:34.415
Exactly.

01:35.396 --> 01:47.109
For some books, the way information is presented, you know, the beauty of the book, the intrinsic value of the presentation will remain important.

01:47.850 --> 01:52.135
For many things, particularly creating electronic form,

01:52.351 --> 02:03.368
that will be less important, particularly as we get more used to receiving information very quickly over networks.

02:03.449 --> 02:10.480
We'll get more of a divorcing of the content from the form itself, I think.

02:11.121 --> 02:12.903
So tell me about your background.

02:14.045 --> 02:14.887
I'm an archivist.

02:15.447 --> 02:16.529
I love documents.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.215
I worked...

02:21.747 --> 02:29.421
I still consider myself an archivist on the income tax, but I've been working in preservation for the last decade.

02:29.441 --> 02:34.611
And for the last six years, I've been investigating the use of digital imaging technology.

02:35.312 --> 02:45.291
My bias about it, there's a... D-Lib is an online journal devoted to...

02:45.862 --> 02:49.410
digital resources in library development.

02:49.650 --> 02:58.008
And there's an article that a colleague and I just wrote, which is in the most recent issue, that talks about our bias about... Can I get a copy of that?

02:58.129 --> 03:00.634
Yeah, I'll give you the URL for it.

03:01.636 --> 03:03.200
It doesn't help you.

03:03.320 --> 03:04.242
URL being what?

03:05.032 --> 03:07.195
Are you plugged into networks?

03:07.215 --> 03:08.637
Yeah, I'll give you the site.

03:08.698 --> 03:09.659
To how I can go get it.

03:09.679 --> 03:11.682
To how you can go get the D-Live article.

03:11.702 --> 03:15.067
And I'll write it down in addition to having it on tape.

03:15.087 --> 03:16.630
Okay, I'll have to look for it.

03:16.830 --> 03:21.637
If we can get it before you leave today.

03:21.717 --> 03:22.458
Please don't forget.

03:22.599 --> 03:25.743
I want to be very useful to you.

03:25.763 --> 03:32.794
In this article, we argue for a digital conversion program that...

03:33.247 --> 03:49.092
begins with an understanding of the informational content of the document and a transference from analog to digital in which that significant information is replicated in the digital file itself.

03:49.112 --> 03:58.967
That it's the best guarantee for the long-term value of the digital file by being as close to the document and its attributes as you can be.

03:59.504 --> 04:11.442
not to create digital images that meet current user needs or are defined by the technical constraints at the time, but to stay close to the document.

04:11.462 --> 04:15.868
It's the least changing of things in a very fast-changing world.

04:16.850 --> 04:25.663
And all of the digital library efforts are based on cost recovery, and cost recovery will come

04:26.977 --> 04:30.443
in creating something with long-term value and utility.

04:31.485 --> 04:39.900
And if you don't stay close to what was valuable in the document in its digital surrogate, you won't have long-term value.

04:40.742 --> 04:46.352
And the costs associated with that conversion are expensive, and they're ameliorated

04:46.957 --> 05:04.138
only over time as you're able to use it in ways that the traditional source document couldn't be used or we could share it and benefit from the costs of sharing, and that we need one, two,

05:04.743 --> 05:34.665
ensure the capture of all significant information so that we only have to scan a document once because it's an expensive proposition and so that the digital file that is created is a processable file so that as we develop new capabilities of interpreting the zeros and ones that go into a digital object it's a rich enough file to support that kind of

05:35.185 --> 05:36.106
of processing.

05:36.606 --> 05:40.270
We can't presume to know what technology is bringing us.

05:40.771 --> 05:45.656
We can't presume to know what users tomorrow are going to want to demand.

05:46.437 --> 05:55.766
And so if we base our digital library developments on current projections of what the future holds, we may be really off base.

05:55.786 --> 06:01.572
So that in a fast changing world, stay close to the center of the wheel, which is the document.

06:02.253 --> 06:04.095
So we begin with a sense of

06:04.379 --> 06:10.707
Know your document, love your document, and understand what happens in the translation process.

06:11.208 --> 06:16.675
Okay, but we still don't know how permanent these digital copies are.

06:16.695 --> 06:17.135
No, we don't.

06:18.337 --> 06:18.797
No, we don't.

06:19.058 --> 06:20.980
And in fact, they're not very permanent at all.

06:21.721 --> 06:24.985
But it's not the technology that is our problem.

06:25.005 --> 06:26.086
So you want to scan it once.

06:26.487 --> 06:27.348
You want to scan it once.

06:27.368 --> 06:29.731
We assume that means once for the next 200 years.

06:29.931 --> 06:30.572
Exactly.

06:31.666 --> 06:50.002
But it's not so much a technological problem as it is an institutional mindset, an ownership of the responsibilities, the development of contractual obligations and the sense of responsibility for that information from the point it's created for 200 years.

06:51.125 --> 06:51.345
Um...

06:51.697 --> 06:52.578
We haven't done that yet.

06:52.798 --> 06:59.206
I don't know of an institution that has really fully committed the kinds of resources to make that happen.

06:59.226 --> 07:07.276
We do it all the time in a paper and film-based world by maintaining proper humidity and temperature controls and all that stuff.

07:07.457 --> 07:09.739
If we didn't do that, we'd lose this collection.

07:09.779 --> 07:12.303
That's correct, but it's also a proven process.

07:12.323 --> 07:18.831
We know the limitations of paper and the vulnerabilities of paper.

07:18.871 --> 07:19.932
We also know the books of paper.

07:24.907 --> 07:25.648
That's correct.

07:25.768 --> 07:26.569
Maybe another 500 years.

07:26.589 --> 07:27.250
That's correct.

07:27.390 --> 07:32.036
We don't know... We don't know what's coming along.

07:32.676 --> 07:40.967
We do know that we can take the bits that comprise a digital object and migrate them with absolute fidelity.

07:41.087 --> 07:44.431
We're not preserving a physical object.

07:44.511 --> 07:46.553
We're preserving... Migrate them.

07:47.575 --> 07:51.960
...through changes in hardware and software and...

07:52.413 --> 07:55.258
image file formats and compression techniques.

07:55.318 --> 08:05.596
It's a complex process of taking the information and moving it to keep pace with technological change.

08:05.817 --> 08:07.099
Somebody has to do that, though.

08:07.139 --> 08:08.522
Somebody has to do it.

08:08.542 --> 08:13.470
Somebody has to be alert to the fact that there has to be a migration made here.

08:13.490 --> 08:16.075
That's absolutely true.

08:22.265 --> 08:23.446
and how to access it.

08:23.466 --> 08:23.987
Absolutely.

08:24.187 --> 08:31.897
But had they been rigorous at the point of the creation and maintenance of those, we would have migrated that stuff.

08:31.957 --> 08:35.281
It's not a big brainer to migrate that stuff.

08:35.301 --> 08:40.987
It's a matter of being vigilant about putting the safeguards in place to do it.

08:41.067 --> 08:45.513
It's not a big brainer, but the fact is there's still stuff there that nobody can access.

08:45.713 --> 08:46.194
Exactly.

08:46.354 --> 08:47.775
Because somebody screwed up.

08:47.796 --> 08:49.337
It's not a technical problem.

08:49.357 --> 08:51.580
It's an institutional problem.

08:51.931 --> 08:55.015
to create the mechanisms to ensure that.

08:56.337 --> 09:02.506
We're going to have to do it anyway because an increasing amount of the information that comes to us comes in that form.

09:03.007 --> 09:05.450
We're not going to print it all and only that form.

09:06.011 --> 09:14.243
And a printed version of it will be less than it is because of the ability to

09:15.488 --> 09:21.715
manipulate, and there is no real document associated with a lot of electronic information.

09:21.735 --> 09:27.742
It's information that we own ourselves, we personalize as a researcher.

09:27.762 --> 09:32.848
So you can't really replicate that information in any other format.

09:33.188 --> 09:37.373
That's a nice concept, that we personalize as a researcher.

09:37.393 --> 09:40.076
But these are tailored little packages, aren't they?

09:40.216 --> 09:45.462
A lot of electronic information is tailored to what the user needs.

09:46.387 --> 10:04.918
Having said all this about digital technology and these sort of glib assurances that it can be done, I'll tell you that we've scanned in-house over a million images, and for every image we have created a beautiful paper facsimile or computer output microfilm that...

10:05.236 --> 10:07.980
meets preservation standards for longevity and quality.

10:08.160 --> 10:09.803
So you've backed everything up.

10:09.823 --> 10:14.350
You know, I sleep at night as a preservation administrator, having an analog backup to that material.

10:14.370 --> 10:16.192
So you've covered your sixes.

10:16.753 --> 10:18.376
You know, that means your sixes.

10:18.496 --> 10:18.856
Right.

10:19.357 --> 10:34.500
The thing is, is that this is a period of transition, and I don't know how long it will last, but I don't trust Cornell or any other institution at this point to ensure that what we created last week will be available to my children's children.

10:40.690 --> 10:41.772
I'm a good grant writer.

10:42.634 --> 10:47.203
It hasn't been something that the institution itself has assumed responsibility for.

10:47.604 --> 10:56.562
We are now, at that point, really coming to terms with Cornell's Digital Library and what the responsibilities are that are associated with it.

10:56.882 --> 10:59.728
And you have space to sort of have copy material?

10:59.708 --> 11:03.414
Well, we're replacing book for book at this point.

11:04.075 --> 11:14.933
One of the things that was interesting about this technology, we began with important math texts from the 19th and early 20th century in two areas, algebra and analysis.

11:16.583 --> 11:22.712
We had a math faculty advisory committee who had said, forget putting this on microfilm.

11:22.732 --> 11:24.455
We use this material this way.

11:24.515 --> 11:26.217
We will not use microfilm.

11:26.237 --> 11:29.302
And the project had been slated to be a preservation photocopy.

11:29.882 --> 11:40.498
When we created the facsimiles from the digital files, the faculty signed off on the original, being on a one-way trip.

11:42.790 --> 11:45.493
Not all of our material, obviously, will be on a one trip.

11:45.713 --> 12:00.911
The stuff down in Crack Library, we will reformat, but we will also retain the originals because of the value associated with the associational value and the information conveyed by the physical object itself.

12:01.572 --> 12:12.645
We had to straighten using the Crack Library as an extreme case of retaining the original, but a writer was simply

12:17.266 --> 12:18.827
Yeah, we do.

12:19.448 --> 12:22.391
So can you have any idea what some of these things might be?

12:22.991 --> 12:23.472
Little books.

12:24.292 --> 12:24.913
Little books?

12:24.933 --> 12:25.694
Printed books.

12:25.714 --> 12:26.314
Printed books.

12:26.595 --> 12:27.135
With what?

12:27.275 --> 12:28.156
Grapples?

12:28.857 --> 12:34.121
Well, we've done New York State and local history, pamphlets and monographs.

12:34.982 --> 12:37.805
We've done 19th century serial literature.

12:38.585 --> 12:44.691
We've done math texts.

12:46.797 --> 12:51.945
For those materials that we are satisfied... So these are ones, basically, not fives.

12:53.307 --> 12:53.748
No, no, no.

12:54.028 --> 12:54.890
Math is a five.

12:56.052 --> 13:03.664
But it is not... It's the information contained in the book itself that was deemed important.

13:03.864 --> 13:04.545
And not the text.

13:04.565 --> 13:05.186
Not the physical text.

13:05.206 --> 13:06.288
Not the art of art.

13:06.488 --> 13:07.810
Not the art of art, right.

13:08.060 --> 13:11.165
Do you have a great hair?

13:12.427 --> 13:19.980
We just bind and trim their spines so that we can create a good, you know, we do page by page scanning of the material.

13:20.020 --> 13:21.262
I'd like to see this.

13:21.382 --> 13:24.647
And I'll take you upstairs and show you what we've done.

13:24.667 --> 13:30.317
And they will, their ultimate, oh, and we've done agriculture, his core agricultural history as well.

13:30.337 --> 13:31.779
Can you give me a look right here?

13:31.799 --> 13:33.021
How many volumes are you here?

13:34.148 --> 13:43.423
Well, we've done over a million images in-house, so that's upwards in the range of maybe 3,000 to 3,500 volumes.

13:43.583 --> 13:54.621
We're in a project right now between us and Michigan, and then also the library's working on stuff that will bring in another nearly 1.5 million images.

13:56.103 --> 14:01.472
And if you roughly think of the volume as 300 pages each, you're probably looking at it.

14:03.680 --> 14:09.006
You know, another 4,000 volumes of material.

14:09.026 --> 14:15.894
And do you have a sense of how to... I mean, this must be a learning operation, though.

14:15.914 --> 14:17.656
How long were you doing here for months?

14:17.676 --> 14:23.724
Actually, we are now... Let me step back and tell you a little bit about what we are doing and what we are doing.

14:24.705 --> 14:28.509
We did a very... If you have any literature on this, this is what we really need.

14:28.529 --> 14:30.572
I'll give you some stuff.

14:30.712 --> 14:32.674
You know, I don't want to speak this up here.

14:32.857 --> 14:35.361
I'll probably get in touch with you.

14:35.381 --> 14:42.992
This book is still a few years later.

14:43.012 --> 14:45.696
I'm learning now.

14:45.756 --> 14:49.000
I don't think I'll print any articles in the next six months or so.

14:49.020 --> 14:53.667
Will you do something?

14:54.541 --> 14:59.446
We started looking at the brittle book, because that's been the focus of our thing.

14:59.466 --> 15:12.740
I did a fairly extensive assessment of printing, topography, and production techniques of the last, you know, hundred years, the hundred year period of brittle books, which was based on the use of metal type.

15:14.561 --> 15:16.984
And metal type has a tendency to spread.

15:17.084 --> 15:21.949
For commercial published things, the metal type spreads, so printers

15:22.098 --> 15:37.963
were careful about how small or how closely spaced they made their letters, their characters, because they wanted the 500th printing to be good.

15:38.821 --> 15:40.383
As good as the first.

15:40.484 --> 15:42.226
Not as good, but good, still good.

15:42.847 --> 15:48.375
The first would have, you know, you have fine metal type, and then over time it spreads a little bit, but good enough.

15:48.796 --> 15:53.744
And so, and they were also confined by what the human eye could see.

15:53.764 --> 16:06.583
And all common type faces from this period, and I did some real assessment of printing topography and specimen pages and examples from books at this period.

16:07.154 --> 16:11.179
used tight fonts five-point or six-point and above.

16:12.861 --> 16:23.034
Those below four-point were considered wonderful evidences of skill, but not practically used in commercial publications at the period.

16:23.054 --> 16:29.722
Characters below about that five-point were hand-lettered, and you'll see that in books over and over again.

16:29.762 --> 16:35.389
They'll have a chart, and there'll be some very small hand-lettering in the chart.

16:37.360 --> 16:46.521
We did an assessment of the height of the smallest lowercase letters and concluded that they were at about one millimeter high.

16:49.748 --> 16:56.483
We then scanned this material at a range of resolutions and concluded, based on a

16:56.952 --> 17:10.236
a benchmarking formula we developed here, that 600 dot print scanning resolution will place 24 dots across that catheter.
