00:02.613 --> 00:04.215
Do you think you're spreading yourself too thin?

00:06.638 --> 00:09.301
Not really, because I work real fast.

00:10.763 --> 00:18.712
And a lot of the thing is that the project of these nine books, The Wizard of Oz, was done over a year ago.

00:18.972 --> 00:22.336
We published it October 15, 85.

00:23.558 --> 00:31.287
So all that happens is you, and the two, there are two of the three Hardport Brace books that were done two years ago that they're just now re-eating.

00:31.992 --> 00:36.337
So a lot of the work has been done over the past three years.

00:36.357 --> 00:41.042
But I don't mean so much in terms of the work, but I mean in terms of exposure.

00:41.763 --> 00:45.487
Do you think you could perhaps be putting too much stuff out there?

00:45.547 --> 00:47.389
There's a great deal of concern about that.

00:47.669 --> 00:50.512
This year is unusual.

00:51.433 --> 00:52.554
It's extraordinary.

00:52.734 --> 00:54.356
This is an unusual year.

00:54.376 --> 00:57.700
I don't think it'll ever happen again.

00:58.320 --> 01:00.683
Yeah, I'm concerned about that.

01:01.203 --> 01:07.832
It's just, what do you do if you have unlimited energy and have all these projects that you're doing and people want to buy them?

01:09.955 --> 01:11.217
I mean, about people want to buy them.

01:11.237 --> 01:13.180
I mean, Harcourt Brace wants to buy the property.

01:15.403 --> 01:23.815
It's very interesting, too, I think, that you're very successful as a small press owner, illustrator, designer.

01:24.215 --> 01:26.639
You may seem to be more successful than is the truth.

01:26.999 --> 01:28.982
However, you're also doing...

01:29.249 --> 01:37.598
You're also doing things for a more general audience, which can afford, with these beautiful editions, to buy them.

01:37.998 --> 01:40.401
Is this something philosophical, or is it commercial?

01:41.242 --> 01:42.563
It's accidental.

01:42.723 --> 01:46.928
It's not anything that's being done out of any intention.

01:47.749 --> 01:55.597
We did those five big books, the two Alice books, and the Oz.

01:56.038 --> 01:59.121
We did those five behemoths.

02:00.620 --> 02:04.746
In as many years as one big major book a year.

02:05.707 --> 02:07.349
Well, we learned a lot about doing that.

02:07.549 --> 02:16.602
One is that there is a finite market and that you can't sell that many books out of one press at that kind of price because it's just the marketplace.

02:16.622 --> 02:17.603
It won't absorb it.

02:17.763 --> 02:23.130
So we have subsequently an enormous number of books in inventory that just don't sell.

02:23.591 --> 02:25.253
Are you talking pennyroyal books now?

02:25.273 --> 02:26.355
Pennyroyal books, yeah.

02:26.375 --> 02:28.037
Yeah, the first limited edition.

02:28.297 --> 02:29.479
We still have those in inventory.

02:29.577 --> 02:32.281
Every one of them except Alice.

02:32.301 --> 02:33.503
I thought Moby Dick went out.

02:33.523 --> 02:35.085
Well, Moby Dick's not a ten-year-old book.

02:35.325 --> 02:35.926
Oh, okay.

02:35.946 --> 02:36.687
Right, right, right.

02:36.767 --> 02:38.450
I'm sorry.

02:38.530 --> 02:40.813
Moby Dick was out of print before it was printed.

02:40.893 --> 02:42.876
So was Alice for the most part.

02:42.936 --> 02:43.938
Why do you suppose that was?

02:44.278 --> 02:45.140
Why Moby Dick?

02:45.160 --> 02:47.102
Why the appeal so much of that one?

02:48.024 --> 02:58.639
If we had done Huckleberry Finn first... I was going to say Huckleberry Finn would have been my... If we had done Huck Finn instead of Alice in the beginning and done it, it would have been the same thing.

02:58.973 --> 03:12.768
If we had taken one of the books, one of the big ones, and then waited a year, published a small one, and then the next year published another big one, then I think we could have probably been able to sell all of those.

03:13.028 --> 03:16.732
And we will sell them eventually, but right now we're just carrying a huge end.

03:16.752 --> 03:20.336
Well, I mean, the price on them is rather end on this.

03:20.356 --> 03:21.437
We're talking $1,000?

03:21.498 --> 03:23.800
Exactly, $1,500.

03:24.202 --> 03:30.891
Which represents, you know, the math of the thing is exactly the way it is in the publishing industry.

03:31.071 --> 03:33.094
Our unit cost on a book like this is about $300.

03:33.114 --> 03:39.423
You know, we put about $200 in terms of, and that's not paying me anything.

03:39.443 --> 03:51.559
We're putting $200 worth of paper and labor into it, the materials all together, and then we spend $100 to $150 in there for the binding.

03:52.147 --> 03:59.314
And so you end up with the usual figure, 25% of your policy.

03:59.394 --> 04:01.677
I mean, when they're sold, they're sold.

04:01.737 --> 04:04.279
And that's when they'd be... I'm just going to check on the sugar.

04:06.001 --> 04:06.802
Okay, back on.

04:07.903 --> 04:19.455
I read someplace where, for most of these works, you had not read the books prior to illustrating them.

04:20.055 --> 04:21.917
It was a first exposure for you.

04:22.657 --> 04:24.460
Is this just accidental?

04:24.660 --> 04:32.992
How can one do these extraordinary illustrations without knowing the works previously, or is it a question of discovery?

04:34.293 --> 04:36.116
I'm trying to get into an area here.

04:36.356 --> 04:41.363
It all goes back to education.

04:41.864 --> 04:47.973
I spent six years in the military school from 1952 to 1958.

04:48.894 --> 04:52.579
I never read a book, if I could help it.

04:53.217 --> 04:57.923
I read classic comic books instead of reading the books themselves.

04:57.943 --> 04:58.944
I was not a good student.

04:59.485 --> 05:02.950
I had no intellectual curiosity whatsoever until I was 25.

05:02.970 --> 05:11.841
I went through college, went four years of college, never read a book, set the Bible in the shape of content.

05:13.143 --> 05:14.164
I mean, I'm not kidding you.

05:14.224 --> 05:15.446
This is the honest to God truth.

05:15.646 --> 05:19.131
I mean, all I did was play ball and make pictures.

05:19.912 --> 05:21.013
That's all I did.

05:21.888 --> 05:23.330
And I didn't play ball very well.

05:24.692 --> 05:25.253
What kind of ball?

05:25.794 --> 05:28.037
Football.

05:28.057 --> 05:30.341
Is there another kind?

05:30.361 --> 05:31.803
Here we have baseball.

05:33.205 --> 05:36.730
I haven't watched a football game in 20 years.

05:36.891 --> 05:38.533
I don't even like this sport.

05:38.553 --> 05:40.336
I never did while I was playing it.

05:40.356 --> 05:41.477
I never played it very well.

05:41.498 --> 05:44.903
And then I wrestled, and I never wrestled very well.

05:44.923 --> 05:46.084
I never won a match.

05:46.104 --> 05:47.306
I lost every match I ever saw.

05:48.588 --> 05:51.152
And I shot through the javelin and the biscuits.

05:51.942 --> 05:59.770
But, you know, mostly what I did was play and draw pictures of naked women.

05:59.790 --> 06:00.591
That's what I did.

06:01.492 --> 06:06.277
And it never read.

06:06.337 --> 06:11.723
So now when I come to a project, it's always coming to a fresh.

06:11.743 --> 06:20.532
And what was at that time, back in the fifties, an aggravation to my instructors is today

06:20.832 --> 06:28.481
to me as a mature artist in books, or a maturing artist, is a great benefit.

06:29.643 --> 06:31.245
You're still a maturing artist.

06:31.265 --> 06:32.826
Oh, I think so.

06:32.846 --> 06:34.909
I've got to hope so.

06:36.791 --> 06:41.277
But it's a great benefit because when I come to the book, I come to it with any preconceived notions.

06:41.577 --> 06:43.279
I come to it without any prejudices.

06:45.503 --> 06:50.409
The only book that I've done, that I read while I was in school, was Frankenstein.

06:50.489 --> 06:55.015
I did read Frankenstein when I was a senior in college.

06:55.035 --> 06:59.580
I think that's the only one of the lot that I hadn't read, isn't that right?

06:59.660 --> 07:00.862
I've never read any of them.

07:00.882 --> 07:01.983
I mean Dante, everyone.

07:02.003 --> 07:03.605
I read that.

07:03.705 --> 07:07.410
Dante is like the Bible almost for an English major, you know.

07:07.897 --> 07:11.530
And for me, it was like, you know, I've heard of that, you know, but that is it.

07:11.791 --> 07:18.936
Well, how does now Coming to the Inferno, which is, you know, the central book of the Divine Comedy,

07:21.295 --> 07:28.885
You read it, you read Alan's translations, and does Alan say that he wants certain things that he wants you to illustrate?

07:28.905 --> 07:32.811
Yeah, he and I got together on many occasions and talked about it.

07:32.851 --> 07:37.577
And he instructed me, God doing that project was like taking a graduate award.

07:37.938 --> 07:39.340
Oh, it really was.

07:39.440 --> 07:40.181
It was amazing.

07:41.342 --> 07:46.610
And he would say and explain to me how this works, and how that works, and the things that I wasn't seeing.

07:46.650 --> 07:49.193
And since that experience, I have seen

07:49.595 --> 07:58.686
more in literature than I would have seen had it not been for my experience with Allen on the Divine Comedy and on the Aeneid.

07:58.806 --> 08:01.409
Which came from, I know they published the Aeneid after.

08:01.569 --> 08:04.333
The Aeneid actually was called his first, because that was what he won the National Book of.

08:04.353 --> 08:07.537
Right, but I mean, the illustrated edition came after.

08:08.037 --> 08:08.538
Came after.

08:08.578 --> 08:12.763
Somewhere in between, actually, between Inferno and Purgatory.

08:12.823 --> 08:16.227
I think it was between Purgatory and Paradiso that it came after.

08:16.477 --> 08:22.606
It was the millennial edition, which, you know, the 2000 anniversary, which is really kind of cute.

08:23.567 --> 08:41.033
Well, even to make it funnier, nobody realized that until the book was on press, and that's why there's no mention of it on the interior of the book, but on the jacket, because they caught it in time to put it on the jacket, the millennial edition.

08:44.084 --> 08:54.158
You mentioned in one of the interviews that you learned from Baskin drawing, and that he instructed you to go out and do a tree about six or seven times.

08:55.060 --> 08:58.525
When are you happy with the drawing now?

08:58.625 --> 09:01.889
Clearly you've reached a level of expertise.

09:02.030 --> 09:05.755
Generally I'm happy with the drawing if it's finished within an hour, an hour and a half.

09:06.983 --> 09:08.787
That's what it takes to do one?

09:08.807 --> 09:19.309
Well, but that might mean that it'll take four or five days of doing an awful lot of drawings of the same one that go into the garbage to come up with the one.

09:19.329 --> 09:21.454
So you don't keep your variant stuff, you check it.

09:21.654 --> 09:22.335
Some I do.

09:22.616 --> 09:26.264
Some I keep, but most of it goes in the fireplace around the garbage.

09:26.284 --> 09:26.865
Which is smart.

09:27.537 --> 09:28.318
Sure is.

09:28.338 --> 09:29.219
I don't want anybody to see.

09:29.239 --> 09:30.942
You don't have people getting them either.

09:31.803 --> 09:33.846
Putting a price on them.

09:33.926 --> 09:37.391
I'm curious now to see those sorts of things.

09:37.411 --> 09:43.660
There was an exhibit in Chicago when I was there last month at the Art Institute of sketchbooks.

09:45.001 --> 09:56.818
In the library they had cases full of sketchbooks from everybody from David Hockney to Aga.

09:56.984 --> 10:10.380
And it's amazing because when you see those intimate things where people are doing in notebook, you see the clumsiness, you see all of the faults that all artists make, and they're making their draftsmanship when they're not on it.

10:11.281 --> 10:13.644
It's like a writer writing out sentence fragments.

10:13.684 --> 10:14.164
Precisely.

10:14.324 --> 10:17.348
Well, the Picasso sketchbooks are just out.

10:17.548 --> 10:19.210
I just got a copy of it the other day.

10:19.851 --> 10:25.978
I haven't had a chance to really absorb it, but it's apparently an extraordinary thing.

10:26.397 --> 10:36.408
How do you explain, you are, I'm not going to say you're unique in publishing today, but really the stuff that you're doing, the audience is basically adult.

10:36.969 --> 10:38.771
Right.

10:38.791 --> 10:39.992
Oh, that's what we left there.

10:40.213 --> 10:40.553
Jump.

10:41.834 --> 10:42.375
No, you got that.

10:42.415 --> 10:42.956
You got Jump.

10:42.996 --> 10:44.097
I got Jump.

10:44.117 --> 10:45.379
We got three from HBJ.

10:45.399 --> 10:47.301
Okay.

10:47.321 --> 10:50.384
And we're going to get to that because it's color and it's clearly for kids.

10:50.945 --> 10:54.649
But before we get to that, explain to me.

10:55.135 --> 10:55.696
if you can.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.498
What's happened in publishing?

10:57.658 --> 11:06.169
We got away from, maybe it was television or the movies or what, but we don't have the NCYF type stuff that used to be so popular.

11:06.249 --> 11:08.132
I wish I knew the answer to the question.

11:08.152 --> 11:14.980
I recently had lunch with Jane Ann Phillips, a writer who I had.

11:17.063 --> 11:19.366
Because I wanted to do a book with her.

11:19.506 --> 11:20.127
I wrote her a letter.

11:20.147 --> 11:21.669
I wrote her a fan letter.

11:21.689 --> 11:24.012
I said, hey, look, I really thank you.

11:24.802 --> 11:26.924
This stuff is really wonderful and so forth.

11:27.504 --> 11:30.527
I don't presume that you know my work, so I'm going to enclose a few things.

11:30.707 --> 11:32.849
It's not too presumptuous and so forth.

11:32.969 --> 11:36.292
What I'm suggesting is that we collaborate on something.

11:36.312 --> 11:36.973
So she called me.

11:37.013 --> 11:38.854
She said, what kind of collaboration do you have in mind?

11:38.874 --> 11:39.755
I said, I thought, that is.

11:40.996 --> 11:48.523
But I think if you're interested, if you're sufficiently interested after seeing the stuff that I sent you, maybe it's worth lunch.

11:48.583 --> 11:49.583
Well, I hope she'd heard of you.

11:50.264 --> 11:51.145
She hadn't.

11:51.165 --> 11:51.525
Jesus.

11:51.765 --> 11:52.826
Which is, that's all right.

11:52.846 --> 11:54.808
There's no big deal there.

11:55.058 --> 12:00.384
She said she had seen some things about Huckleberry Finn, but really wasn't that familiar with it.

12:00.404 --> 12:02.287
Just fine.

12:03.248 --> 12:06.051
So I went over to Brookline, we had lunch together, and we hit it all.

12:06.892 --> 12:13.340
And there probably will be at some point a project, but I don't know what the project will be.

12:13.360 --> 12:17.825
The thing that brought that to mind is, I asked her, I said, what is it?

12:18.466 --> 12:23.412
Why is it that there are no longer liaisons in the

12:23.898 --> 12:35.195
in the world like there was between Dickens and Crookshane, between Kimball and Twain, between Carol and Tenney.

12:35.215 --> 12:37.458
And the answer apparently is twofold.

12:38.479 --> 12:41.624
And I've also had the same discussion with Eudora Welty.

12:42.645 --> 12:51.238
I've had similar discussions with other people as well, Jamie Yolen.

12:52.096 --> 12:58.243
I'm just now getting into correspondence with Ellen Gilchrist and it's the same.

12:58.263 --> 13:03.390
Well, apparently the answer lies somewhere in these two things.

13:03.430 --> 13:13.302
One, most writers today paint the pictures themselves to the point where they don't want anybody like me fucking around with them.

13:13.322 --> 13:15.424
You know, basically.

13:15.865 --> 13:16.746
Do you really believe that?

13:17.487 --> 13:20.030
I think that's what most of the writers really do believe.

13:20.050 --> 13:21.732
That's what they probably say, but...

13:22.100 --> 13:25.625
Well, I said, my response to that to Jane Ann was this.

13:25.705 --> 13:27.067
I said, you know, yes.

13:27.127 --> 13:27.888
Did she imply that?

13:28.348 --> 13:29.089
She said that.

13:29.129 --> 13:30.151
She didn't just imply it.

13:30.191 --> 13:31.513
She made a statement.

13:31.533 --> 13:34.397
How about Eudora, who's really from another generation?

13:34.417 --> 13:40.204
Yeah, now she's an entirely different thing, because I'm doing the Robert Bridegroom with her, and that'll be out probably next fall.

13:40.705 --> 13:42.928
And that's my big project.

13:42.968 --> 13:43.929
Who's going to publish that?

13:44.410 --> 13:49.677
Well, I'm going to publish it in a limited edition of about 100 copies, 150 copies, and then HBJ will bring it.

13:49.876 --> 13:55.723
Yeah, and then I'll do it with… Will she sign them?

13:55.743 --> 13:58.827
The hundred copies she probably will, yeah.

13:58.847 --> 14:00.229
We'll file them all down there.

14:01.170 --> 14:02.572
What would you sell those for?

14:03.073 --> 14:06.838
They'll go probably for about a thousand, something like that.

14:06.858 --> 14:08.560
Because they'll only be about a hundred on the market.

14:08.700 --> 14:14.247
We have long since seen today that we'll ever do another edition of 350 books.

14:15.003 --> 14:23.754
You know, because 350 books, you're talking about $40,000 worth of bindings, and I'm just not going to have $40,000 sitting up there in that barn, which is very ridiculous.

14:23.814 --> 14:26.817
Anyway, go ahead.

14:27.037 --> 14:32.164
This is a meeting that just happened three weeks ago in Jackson, and I'm talking with her.

14:34.366 --> 14:44.098
You know, the book was based on the Grimm fairy tale, the Robert Brian Croom, but it was also then populated by or peopled by characters who were historical characters

14:44.669 --> 14:51.938
in the Natchez Trace, and in Rodney's Landing, Mississippi, and all this, kind of the Hart Brothers and all that.

14:51.958 --> 14:56.263
Well, I asked her, I said, now, because I usually do a lot of research on them.

14:57.565 --> 14:58.046
I study.

14:58.066 --> 15:01.710
When I say I've never read these books before, I come to them.

15:01.730 --> 15:02.932
It doesn't mean I don't know them now.

15:03.632 --> 15:04.594
And I know these books.

15:04.814 --> 15:06.957
I really know the books once I get into them.

15:06.977 --> 15:11.402
I read them probably, on average, I read them five times.

15:11.737 --> 15:14.921
Well, about three times before I start working.

15:16.062 --> 15:24.032
And then once I start working and I'm working on an image of Pat Finn, I'll read the whole bloody book up until the time of course he dies.

15:24.052 --> 15:39.412
I'll read that over and over and over to make certain that there's no mention of some physical characteristic that I missed, you know, that he wears spectacles or that he's clean-shaven or that he has a beard or he's missing one ear, you know, or something like that's a mole on his cheek.

15:39.752 --> 15:40.613
Something that might

15:41.302 --> 15:44.847
It might escape you on a first reading and a second reading.

15:44.947 --> 15:46.550
So I go back and do that sort of thing.

15:46.590 --> 15:49.755
So parts of both I bloody well know by heart.

15:50.315 --> 15:52.118
I quote them at length.

15:53.200 --> 15:53.740
But at any rate.

15:54.001 --> 15:55.383
Have you made any mistakes like that?

15:56.264 --> 15:56.945
Not that I know of.

15:56.965 --> 15:58.648
Have you given somebody a moment that you shouldn't have?

15:58.708 --> 15:59.609
I'm sure I have.

15:59.990 --> 16:01.873
I'm sure I have, but not that I know of.

16:03.415 --> 16:04.396
Okay.

16:05.638 --> 16:08.422
It's the beard that worries me that I'll miss.

16:08.583 --> 16:09.604
Somewhere it says it.

16:09.888 --> 16:14.513
You know, his long flowing beard, and I miss that making clean shaver.

16:14.733 --> 16:18.797
That sort of makes my skin crawl to think about doing something like that.

16:19.437 --> 16:21.980
But anyway, where was I?

16:22.320 --> 16:30.128
So asking Eudora, I said, now how do you think, how much research do you think I should do on this?

16:30.808 --> 16:34.132
And she said, none.

16:34.152 --> 16:39.557
And I said, well, I was just wondering, you know, because you use historical character, and so she did a wonderful essay called

16:39.875 --> 16:44.803
A Fairy Tale of the Natchez Trace, which she gave to the Mississippi Historical Society.

16:44.823 --> 16:45.744
I hear that.

16:45.764 --> 16:50.372
It's in the eye of the story.

16:50.632 --> 16:52.635
It was also published separately, I think.

16:52.655 --> 16:54.338
Yes, it was.

16:54.558 --> 16:57.763
So anyway, she said, no.

16:57.783 --> 16:58.565
I said, well, okay.

16:58.605 --> 17:02.170
But I said, I probably will anyway, because it's just my way of working.

17:02.971 --> 17:04.714
Fine.

17:04.794 --> 17:08.380
Mr. Dorff, how much input do you want to have in this?

17:08.832 --> 17:10.994
Do you want to see galleys?

17:11.014 --> 17:13.417
Do you want to correct galleys again?"

17:13.897 --> 17:14.638
She said, no.

17:14.658 --> 17:16.199
You're going to design the book as well?

17:16.300 --> 17:17.020
I've already done that.

17:17.040 --> 17:17.661
That's all done.

17:17.741 --> 17:19.583
Type is being set now.

17:19.603 --> 17:20.344
Oh, so you're moving.

17:20.704 --> 17:21.665
Yeah.

17:21.685 --> 17:23.146
Well, actually, type's not being set.

17:23.166 --> 17:25.008
Type is specced and ready to be set.

17:25.509 --> 17:28.652
As soon as we have contract negotiations done, that'll probably take another six weeks.

17:28.672 --> 17:29.313
Now, who picked this?

17:30.033 --> 17:31.735
Is this something that you decided to do?

17:31.755 --> 17:35.779
Well, I met her in… She had a number of interesting works.

17:35.859 --> 17:37.641
Why this particular one?

17:37.857 --> 17:42.862
She and I came to the conclusion at her house drinking bourbon whiskey.

17:43.062 --> 17:47.267
May 20, God, I thought I'd never forget that day.

17:47.327 --> 17:49.749
I think it was May 21st, May 22nd or something.

17:49.769 --> 17:57.517
Just at the, you know, just at the eyes of spring or the first of the summer, whatever.

17:57.537 --> 17:58.518
Was this down in New Orleans?

17:58.838 --> 18:00.560
It was in Jackson, in her home.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.182
Oh, so you went over there from the ABA.

18:02.582 --> 18:06.686
I went to Jackson prior to the ABA and then drove down with these friends.

18:06.706 --> 18:07.527
I miss seeing you at the ABA.

18:08.080 --> 18:11.964
Yeah, I always do ABA.

18:12.584 --> 18:13.845
It's such a great time anyway.

18:13.986 --> 18:16.268
The last two years of San Francisco to the Welland Room.

18:17.249 --> 18:19.731
You can put together so much business at ABA.

18:19.751 --> 18:21.893
I mean, it's absolutely amazing.

18:21.913 --> 18:35.826
So anyway, I went to her house, and it was an invitation that had been worked by my friend John Evans, and we went over to her house, and he introduced us, and because we had met

18:36.329 --> 18:38.631
Several years, God, this is such a long and bold story.

18:38.691 --> 18:40.573
I'll try to make it very simple and fast.

18:40.593 --> 18:43.975
We had met, I think, first in Dallas, maybe.

18:43.995 --> 18:47.819
Then we had seen each other at John and Mel Evans from Jacksonville.

18:47.839 --> 18:51.562
They're one of the most wonderful bookstores I've ever been in.

18:52.042 --> 18:53.443
Then we met again in Washington.

18:53.463 --> 18:55.065
Then we met again in San Francisco.

18:55.345 --> 18:58.668
And I'd never read Eudor Wealthy until I read One Writer's Beginning.

18:59.989 --> 19:05.914
And so when I met John at San Francisco at a cocktail party with a jazz orchestra and a half,

19:06.468 --> 19:11.294
We were shooting and I said, you know, I just read a book by a neighbor of yours.

19:11.314 --> 19:12.215
And he said, who's that?

19:12.255 --> 19:13.257
And I said, you're doing well.

19:13.297 --> 19:14.418
He said, oh, really, what book?

19:14.438 --> 19:15.900
And I said, one writer's beginning.

19:16.681 --> 19:18.744
She's a big fan of yours.

19:19.365 --> 19:19.945
Of yours?

19:20.426 --> 19:20.706
What?

19:21.107 --> 19:25.352
Oh, yeah, she just thinks your work is wonderful.

19:25.372 --> 19:28.537
And I said, oh, he said, oh, God, it would give me so much pleasure.

19:28.857 --> 19:31.260
So much pleasure if I could put you two together.

19:31.966 --> 19:50.950
So then when it turns out that ABA is going to be in New Orleans, he said, why don't you come down a few days early, spend some time with us, you know, with me and my family, and we'll fix you some good Southern food, you know, for that long, for part of my heritage that I really miss, you know, turn and bring the red jiggas, and I'll introduce you.

19:50.970 --> 19:52.392
So that's what I did.

19:52.412 --> 19:58.640
I went over and we sat in her living room and drank bourbon whiskey and got to talk about it.

19:58.660 --> 20:01.804
Pop the record, but is she a pretty good, did she pop them down...

20:02.257 --> 20:03.959
as well as the next night.

20:03.979 --> 20:06.782
Yeah, she hangs right in there.

20:06.802 --> 20:09.846
I mean, the four of us put away a right smart amount of that bottle that night.

20:09.866 --> 20:12.088
I'll tell you, we made a major assault.

20:12.108 --> 20:13.430
She's just spectacular.

20:14.271 --> 20:15.352
What a woman, Jesus.

20:15.753 --> 20:21.539
So she said to me that she would really like to do something together.

20:21.779 --> 20:28.687
And I had just read a story that had been given to her called the Shoebirds that she used for HBJ a long time ago.

20:30.349 --> 20:30.930
And she...

20:31.315 --> 20:32.457
went nuts.

20:32.937 --> 20:34.059
I hate that story.

20:34.219 --> 20:36.402
I don't ever want to hear that story's name mentioned.

20:36.482 --> 20:42.851
I just, you know, she's the only thing I've ever did for money, she said, and I've never, ever allowed that to be reprinted.

20:42.871 --> 20:45.634
And I said, okay, well, let's change the subject.

20:45.654 --> 20:50.641
She said, well, if you would, of all of my work that you know, what would you like to do?

20:50.661 --> 20:55.247
And I said, well, if I had my, if I had my brothers, I'd do the Robert Bradley.

20:55.267 --> 20:59.213
She clenched up her fist like this, and she said, oh, I was hoping you would say that.

21:00.454 --> 21:01.035
And, uh,

21:02.062 --> 21:03.904
So that's where it came from.

21:04.385 --> 21:09.933
The next day I called John Boynton, who was my editor at Hartford, in the adult trade section.

21:11.074 --> 21:13.017
Told him about the conversation.

21:13.037 --> 21:16.201
He said, I'll do his research, found out he owns the property of what we do.

21:16.361 --> 21:21.488
So they own the property, she wants to do it, I want to do it, so we're going to do it.

21:21.508 --> 21:24.272
Didn't Hartford Price do that particular book?

21:24.973 --> 21:26.415
I think it was first published by...

21:27.104 --> 21:28.986
Doubleday or Random.

21:29.046 --> 21:30.368
She's done a couple with Random.

21:30.448 --> 21:33.933
There was a world title in there, which is now defunct.

21:33.953 --> 21:35.415
I know, because I collect her.

21:36.977 --> 21:39.700
Well, the rights were sold to HBJ.

21:39.720 --> 21:40.020
Okay.

21:41.122 --> 21:44.366
Because they've been her publisher for a number of years now.

21:44.406 --> 21:50.814
John Peron is still her editor, and he was with HBJ for forever.

21:51.095 --> 21:52.136
Is she writing anything?

21:52.656 --> 21:55.440
Nobody knows, and nobody's willing to ask.

21:56.348 --> 21:57.710
I just wrote her yesterday and asked her.

21:57.730 --> 22:02.196
I mean, she's an elderly woman, and you could understand if she's done.

22:02.216 --> 22:11.748
Well, the thing is, in this conversation, she said to me, before the Robert Bridegroom came up, I don't tell a lot, but this is all honest to God's truth.

22:12.269 --> 22:15.052
Don't expect me to use 90% of this either, by the way.

22:15.072 --> 22:15.473
Oh, no, no.

22:18.277 --> 22:21.681
She said to me, she said, you know, I would be honored to write something for you.

22:22.724 --> 22:26.089
She said that to me, and I sit there with my mouth open.

22:26.550 --> 22:27.852
That's a real collectible item.

22:28.613 --> 22:29.535
What?

22:29.555 --> 22:37.327
And I said, well, no, I wouldn't, I couldn't, how could I possibly say, oh, would you?

22:38.589 --> 22:41.313
But she did make the offer, and she made the offer a couple of times.

22:41.433 --> 22:44.118
She made the offer again while I was down there.

22:44.158 --> 22:45.720
She must really love your work.

22:46.101 --> 22:47.203
Well, apparently.

22:47.763 --> 22:48.765
Does she have everything?

22:49.150 --> 22:50.732
You should have sent everything.

22:50.792 --> 22:53.715
Everything that I know that she doesn't have, I send to her.

22:53.735 --> 22:55.798
Absolutely.

22:56.299 --> 22:57.059
Who knows?

22:57.140 --> 22:59.823
I rode in the elevator with her at the Algonquin Hotel once.

23:00.383 --> 23:05.670
It was just, she was in New York to get some medal, you know, coming in half hungover in the morning.

23:05.710 --> 23:10.816
Miss Welty, you know, such a pleasure.

23:10.896 --> 23:13.419
Congratulations, you're a great heroine of life.

23:14.220 --> 23:15.181
She's so funny.

23:15.201 --> 23:18.465
She was just telling me about, she received some medal in Washington.

23:21.213 --> 23:23.575
It wasn't the Medal of Freedom or was it?

23:23.876 --> 23:24.777
Christ, it might have been.

23:25.257 --> 23:26.779
She was there with Aaron Copeland.

23:26.879 --> 23:28.060
I think that's what it was.

23:28.080 --> 23:33.746
Yeah, Reagan gives this, the Congressional Medal of Freedom or something like that, that they give to the artists.

23:33.786 --> 23:37.250
And that would be in line, yeah.

23:37.390 --> 23:41.894
She was really kind of amused with the whole thing.

23:41.935 --> 23:46.559
She said, I arrived at the airport and she said, they meet me with a wheelchair.

23:46.579 --> 23:47.220
And she said,

23:47.690 --> 23:49.593
I don't need a wheelchair.

23:49.613 --> 23:51.295
Isn't that something?

23:51.335 --> 23:53.098
That's insulting, that really is.

23:53.118 --> 23:54.400
It really is, yeah.

23:54.761 --> 24:06.678
But to get, to just get back on track of that, one thing about illustrating for adults, and why people aren't, why we're not illustrating contemporary fiction.

24:07.439 --> 24:08.261
That was where we were.

24:08.281 --> 24:09.222
Yeah, exactly.

24:09.262 --> 24:14.490
But what we're, the outline is, okay, we went over there and we talked about the artist, the writer,

24:16.073 --> 24:19.856
sense of interference with his or her imagery.

24:20.457 --> 24:22.358
I think it's a legitimate point of view.

24:23.119 --> 24:30.845
My response to Jane Ann Phillips about that was, well, yes, that is true so long as you see illustration is serving only one function, and that is to parallel the text.

24:31.326 --> 24:35.669
You can illustrate a book by doing something other than that.

24:35.729 --> 24:41.935
There are a lot of, you know, when I did The Red Badge of Courage, Fleming is nowhere in there.

24:42.215 --> 24:45.878
There's no specific illustration that penned that book.

24:46.162 --> 25:12.979
parallels it but from a different point of view entirely uh from whose point of view well it takes it takes the book i take the book apart because essentially what happens is you have the young man who the the boy who is taught that war is something glorious you know the the drum and fight and all that kind of bullshit then you've got the the the politicians that that wage that make the wars and the generals that wage the war then you've got the foot soldiers

25:16.030 --> 25:17.832
And he's got the dead soldiers.

25:17.872 --> 25:39.076
So what I did was take images of soldiers and children playing in war and so forth, and went through all of the wars that America has been in since the Civil War, beginning with the Civil War, which is where that story set, coming all the way up to Vietnam, and taking it and putting those illustrations in those kinds of categories.

25:39.096 --> 25:40.537
Did you try to make a statement at all?

25:40.718 --> 25:42.720
That was, yeah, that was somewhat didactic.

25:42.740 --> 25:45.463
And I had read someplace where you saw Frankenstein as a

25:45.882 --> 25:48.925
As an opportunity to make a political statement.

25:49.085 --> 25:50.026
Which went awry.

25:50.066 --> 25:53.790
I found more in it after I got going than I thought I was.

25:53.810 --> 25:54.992
I found a different direction.

25:55.032 --> 25:58.615
I found more politics than I was expecting.

25:58.635 --> 26:01.619
But not the politics that I was originally dealing with.

26:02.019 --> 26:03.100
Alright, so that's one thing.

26:03.460 --> 26:11.569
The other thing is that in today's marketplace, the specter of money, it looms so big.

26:12.258 --> 26:16.485
That publisher gives out 10% royalties with an illustrator.

26:16.985 --> 26:18.588
If I want to do a book, I want royalties.

26:18.608 --> 26:20.331
I don't want to be paid to do something.

26:20.351 --> 26:22.274
I want royalties.

26:23.996 --> 26:25.699
If I go blind, that's it.

26:26.640 --> 26:27.622
Curtains for me.

26:27.642 --> 26:32.569
I'd like to have royalties coming in to support me, at least partially.

26:32.970 --> 26:34.873
Anyway, just the economics.

26:35.022 --> 26:40.223
I want 5% of the loyalties, so the writer's got to be willing to take 5% of the loyalties.

26:40.243 --> 26:41.407
And so you get that problem.

26:41.428 --> 26:43.817
The publishers can be pushed up to...

26:44.590 --> 26:51.879
Maybe give me a 15% royalty where each other would be getting seven or I would be willing to take five and a writer ten or split it.

26:51.899 --> 26:58.047
That's a contemporary stuff, but that's why you're doing all these dead writers, obviously.

26:58.387 --> 26:59.448
That was one of my questions.

26:59.468 --> 27:01.371
The thing is, I'm tired of doing dead writers.

27:01.471 --> 27:05.916
I'm tired of dealing with dead writers and I'm tired of dealing with 19th century sensibilities.

27:06.637 --> 27:14.547
Not that I'm tired of dealing with 19th century costume or crapping and that sort of thing, but the sensibilities of the 19th century

27:14.678 --> 27:16.700
But you're fascinating and wonderful.

27:17.601 --> 27:19.002
It's time to come into the 20th century.

27:19.023 --> 27:20.684
I'd like to get into my own time.

27:20.704 --> 27:23.928
So you're going to start with Eudora.

27:24.628 --> 27:28.432
That's the small end of the wedge, or it might be the big end of the wedge.

27:28.873 --> 27:31.435
Yeah, and you've approached Jane Ann.

27:31.856 --> 27:34.078
And Alan Gilchrist and a few others.

27:34.919 --> 27:36.461
Alan Gilchrist is interesting.

27:36.481 --> 27:36.921
Yes, she is.

27:37.261 --> 27:38.202
Real interesting.

27:38.222 --> 27:39.744
But she doesn't write long fiction, though.

27:39.844 --> 27:40.385
Yes, she does.

27:40.585 --> 27:41.406
The Annunciation.

27:41.646 --> 27:42.467
There's one novel.

27:42.707 --> 27:43.128
Is that right?

27:43.488 --> 27:43.588
Yeah.

27:44.193 --> 27:50.760
Oh yeah, okay, sure.

27:51.140 --> 27:52.862
I thought she's really a short story writer.

27:53.663 --> 27:57.607
She is, but that's her one novel, an extraordinary novel.

27:58.969 --> 28:05.375
And Nancy Willard, I'm just now reading Nancy Willard, I'm doing a book with her next year too.

28:05.836 --> 28:06.817
All women so far.

28:07.457 --> 28:13.744
You know, with the exception of Norman Maclean, the only people that I've read in the last year

28:14.483 --> 28:18.289
that I think are really, really good writers and women.

28:20.672 --> 28:21.413
Oh, fiction too.

28:21.433 --> 28:27.322
Have you ever thought of doing, you know, everything you've mentioned so far as a fictional work as a possible tool?

28:27.362 --> 28:30.547
The only living writer who's ever worked with a poet.

28:32.489 --> 28:38.458
And I've worked with a lot of poets, but I really have a penchant for fiction.

28:39.560 --> 28:41.723
Is that stack of books over there in the corner?

28:42.361 --> 28:44.044
That's all for me to read.

28:44.084 --> 28:46.168
That's my reading list now.

28:46.228 --> 28:47.530
And most of that is by men.

28:48.652 --> 28:49.914
You know, Barry Hanno.

28:50.696 --> 28:51.537
Jim Harrison.

28:51.918 --> 28:52.439
Yeah.

28:52.459 --> 28:52.879
Wonderful.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.364
Legends of the Fall, if you've ever read that.

28:55.404 --> 28:58.489
This is all books that have been recommended to me, the people of English.

28:58.650 --> 28:59.972
These are things that you should read.

29:00.092 --> 29:01.795
Oh, the Sue Miller is super.

29:01.815 --> 29:02.576
Have you read the book?

29:02.717 --> 29:06.343
I just started it.

29:08.298 --> 29:09.700
That's where I'm headed.

29:10.080 --> 29:13.204
I want to deal with, I'd like to deal with my contemporaries.

29:13.224 --> 29:16.749
Because you're even looking at Dutch Lenin, so really you're considering everything.

29:17.490 --> 29:21.135
Mysteries, adventures, contemporary stuff.

29:21.335 --> 29:28.264
So we're at the really, to go back to something you said earlier, you're maturing steadily.

29:28.733 --> 29:30.796
You're at the crossroads.

29:30.836 --> 29:33.960
You're about to really embark on an entire new area.

29:33.980 --> 29:35.482
Is that a fair... That's fair.

29:35.783 --> 29:36.444
That's exciting.

29:36.564 --> 29:37.686
That's what I think.

29:37.706 --> 29:40.950
I think everything I've done up to this point has been preparatory.

29:42.352 --> 29:44.916
To doing contemporaries doing what I want to do.

29:45.496 --> 29:46.958
To do the major work.

29:46.978 --> 29:52.707
And I think the major work... If I can just convince a handful of people... What is the major work that we do?

29:52.727 --> 29:55.230
The major work will be contemporary literature, okay?

29:55.582 --> 29:58.244
Now go ahead, if I can convince a handful of people.

29:58.264 --> 30:04.930
If I can convince a half a dozen more people, you know, and I think starting with Edole Wealthy is a good place to start.

30:04.950 --> 30:06.632
It's not going to start much better.

30:09.194 --> 30:11.316
See what can happen to your... How about William?

30:11.556 --> 30:12.477
Read William Kennedy.

30:13.858 --> 30:15.480
I had never read William Kennedy before.

30:15.500 --> 30:17.181
He's one of the ones right up there on my list.

30:17.221 --> 30:17.822
Yeah.

30:17.942 --> 30:18.722
Norman McLean.

30:19.163 --> 30:20.504
He's going to be in Boston in a couple weeks.

30:21.545 --> 30:21.945
Really?

30:22.145 --> 30:23.306
I did a children's day.

30:23.326 --> 30:25.048
Let me just shut this up for a second.

30:26.463 --> 30:28.025
Give me that quote again.

30:28.065 --> 30:33.891
You saw somebody wearing a button on a lapel which said, so many books, so little time.

30:34.411 --> 30:34.972
And that's it.

30:35.292 --> 30:53.871
And really, I mean, how in the name of God, and I have to depend on people like yourself and John Evans and people say, geez, you know, and here's somebody you should read, because otherwise I can't, I read the New York Times there, you know, on Sundays, you know,

30:54.188 --> 30:57.071
There was Peter Taylor's new book yesterday.

30:57.131 --> 31:00.996
I said, thank God I've got to read that, but what am I going to do with all this?

31:01.036 --> 31:03.139
I mean, which one am I going to do?

31:03.159 --> 31:04.821
Have you read any of Dutch Leonard's stuff?

31:04.841 --> 31:05.001
No.

31:05.782 --> 31:06.723
You won't be able to put it.

31:06.743 --> 31:08.485
You've got the latest one there, I think.

31:08.505 --> 31:11.108
You've got a proof of the new one.

31:11.288 --> 31:16.014
I read Glitz last year, when I remember that came out a year or two years ago, and then I went through a Leonard thing.

31:16.034 --> 31:17.676
I had to read ten of his books.

31:17.956 --> 31:22.221
Another one of my problems is I read very slowly.

31:22.640 --> 31:24.562
So do I, and I read for a living.

31:25.944 --> 31:27.846
Well, I don't know.

31:27.866 --> 31:34.054
I'm reading faster and faster as time goes on, but I mean, I read it slightly above a level of mentally handicapped.

31:34.074 --> 31:35.175
Oh, come on, don't say that.

31:35.195 --> 31:38.459
What are you doing, thirty pages an hour, forty pages an hour?

31:40.021 --> 31:45.407
Well, that's about what I do, and I read three, four books a week.

31:46.518 --> 31:51.346
I will never take a speed reading course, either, because I think you'd lose so much.

31:51.546 --> 31:53.770
See, I proofread my life.

31:53.790 --> 31:57.777
See, that's a problem, because I'm a typesetter and I'm a printer, and I just read it.

31:57.797 --> 32:00.021
Things like it really bother me.

32:00.622 --> 32:02.605
I'm reading this Nancy Willard book now.

32:02.765 --> 32:05.730
I picked up three typos last night.

32:06.151 --> 32:08.695
There was one in the Aeneid, I think, wasn't there?

32:09.113 --> 32:10.695
I wouldn't be surprised.

32:10.715 --> 32:12.877
Very early on in the years, and it kind of ticked me off.

32:12.897 --> 32:17.042
I remember them going back several years now, but there's a typo almost in them.

32:18.303 --> 32:21.347
Even before it's like page one, it's one of the prefatory pages.

32:21.547 --> 32:22.548
Oh, God, not Alex.

32:22.608 --> 32:26.733
There's the word California's misspelled.

32:26.873 --> 32:28.015
Yeah, things like that.

32:28.035 --> 32:29.656
They drive you nuts.

32:29.957 --> 32:32.860
But anyway.

32:33.380 --> 32:34.802
So I guess that's part of it.

32:35.342 --> 32:43.572
One of the things I have heard is you have chosen texts that seem to tread the middle water, works of interest and wonder to both children and adults.

32:44.513 --> 32:48.418
You know, Huckleberry Finn, Alice.

32:49.019 --> 32:54.685
Was this by design, or was it merely just the way it happened?

32:55.827 --> 32:58.510
The first two books, Alice and Looking Glass,

33:00.194 --> 33:06.462
Well, we did this first, but that's not my impression, so that's why I intend to omit it.

33:06.482 --> 33:08.024
And that was a commission.

33:10.126 --> 33:16.774
The other books came about as to how to make a, you know, what I want to do is to make a big, beautiful book.

33:17.175 --> 33:19.398
What book do you want to make big and beautiful?

33:20.359 --> 33:22.922
Well, that depends on what book you think you can sell.

33:23.983 --> 33:27.788
Because you can't go out and spend a quarter of a million dollars on a project and

33:29.152 --> 33:30.333
not hope to sell it.

33:30.493 --> 33:32.816
So you have to do a little market research and so forth.

33:32.876 --> 33:45.748
So in our talking to dealers and booksellers and so forth in the antiquarian market, a lot of the books that we've done are titles that came out of that research that seem to have a good market.

33:45.768 --> 33:47.010
What others are you thinking about?

33:48.111 --> 33:48.551
Right now?

33:48.992 --> 33:52.435
Are you kind of really forging ahead?

33:52.455 --> 33:54.077
I'm phasing all that out.

33:54.117 --> 33:55.598
We'll probably do Jacqueline Hyde.

33:56.253 --> 33:57.955
It'll be interesting.

33:57.975 --> 34:01.359
I was supposed to get that done this year, because this is the 86th anniversary.

34:01.379 --> 34:04.223
And I was going to mark that anniversary.

34:04.263 --> 34:06.025
Nobody else seems to be doing anything.

34:06.045 --> 34:06.906
It's news to me.

34:07.867 --> 34:11.071
And I've already got an introduction by Joyce Carol Oates.

34:11.392 --> 34:12.673
It's in the desk back there.

34:12.693 --> 34:13.514
You know, everything is square.

34:13.535 --> 34:17.319
It's both designed and types that are copied.

34:17.519 --> 34:18.601
Everything's ready to go.

34:18.621 --> 34:24.308
Using a new text, or a standard text, or an MLA kind of a text.

34:24.328 --> 34:25.990
And we're not going after any kind of...

34:26.257 --> 34:29.802
Like the Huckleberry Finn was a major text.

34:29.842 --> 34:31.805
See, Huckleberry Finn was commissioned at the University of California.

34:31.825 --> 34:33.086
Yeah, but that's a major text.

34:33.106 --> 34:33.847
Right.

34:34.168 --> 34:36.251
It almost would cause a first edition, I think.

34:36.371 --> 34:39.695
Seven or eight years of restoration.

34:39.715 --> 34:41.017
Yeah.

34:41.037 --> 34:43.360
Yeah, it's a major, major textual work.

34:43.380 --> 34:47.085
So it's to Alice that it's major textual work.

34:47.105 --> 34:52.232
Frankenstein is simply the first printing, the 1818.

34:54.475 --> 34:55.757
What else?

34:56.918 --> 35:01.964
The Wizard of Oz is, again, the first American franchise, no big deal.

35:01.984 --> 35:04.328
And so the same would be with that.

35:04.828 --> 35:15.622
But you see, what I want to do is, I really, in terms of finishing that up, from Frankenstein to Huckleberry Finn, never mind.

35:15.642 --> 35:25.795
From Frankenstein to Dr. Jekyll and Hyde, then I would like to follow that with Dracula, and then follow that with Picture Dorian Gray.

35:26.230 --> 35:32.458
Those are the four books of the 19th century that I would still like to do, the three that I would still like to do.

35:32.478 --> 35:34.902
And then just kind of kiss off that century leg there.

35:35.282 --> 35:36.364
And then stop it.

35:36.404 --> 35:38.206
Do the four big horror things, you know.

35:38.707 --> 35:41.030
Because those are very appealing to me.

35:41.050 --> 35:44.895
And Oates has already written the Frankenstein introduction.

35:44.915 --> 35:45.296
She's a good, yeah.

35:45.316 --> 35:46.177
That was a good introduction.

35:46.197 --> 35:49.782
She would also do Dracula and the others.

35:49.802 --> 35:52.085
We talked about that and she's already agreed to do them.

35:52.105 --> 35:53.487
So I've got all that in place.

35:54.462 --> 35:57.406
It's just a matter of my energy.

35:57.747 --> 36:06.860
The thing is, I did so much of that so fast that I think I may have burned something.

36:06.880 --> 36:08.322
Are there any pictures that you'd take back?

36:09.464 --> 36:10.485
All of them.

36:10.505 --> 36:12.188
Really?

36:12.208 --> 36:15.272
All except maybe three.

36:15.753 --> 36:20.520
But the point is, it's just like a writer, you can never be happy with the latest draft.

36:21.496 --> 36:22.658
You'd always like... That's all it is.

36:22.678 --> 36:23.739
It's the latest draft.

36:23.759 --> 36:28.205
If I hadn't... And there comes a point where you have to say, Fini.

36:28.225 --> 36:28.485
Done.

36:28.665 --> 36:29.887
Let's get on to the next job.

36:30.468 --> 36:37.978
I said someplace, some place that I wrote something, I said, you know, I never consider that I ever finish anything.

36:38.939 --> 36:39.640
I just quit.

36:39.840 --> 36:41.723
There's a point at which I have to stop.

36:42.083 --> 36:42.444
Interesting.

36:42.504 --> 36:44.106
I did an interview with William Kennedy.

36:44.126 --> 36:46.269
I'll send you a copy of that interview, by the way.

36:46.289 --> 36:49.012
It was in the same magazine a couple of years ago.

36:49.072 --> 36:51.115
I'll send you all of them when this thing comes out.

36:52.040 --> 36:58.133
But Viking had brought out his first novel, which was 69, with a new introduction.

36:58.153 --> 37:00.117
And I said, boy, here they were bringing it out.

37:00.137 --> 37:01.841
And it is his least successful novel.

37:01.881 --> 37:02.583
It's his first.

37:02.603 --> 37:07.954
And I said, were you even slightly tempted to go in there and retool it?

37:08.656 --> 37:10.740
He said, no, he said, because that's completed work.

37:11.024 --> 37:15.880
It represents a phase in my development and where I was at that time.

37:15.960 --> 37:20.635
And sure, I see the weaknesses and I know the weaknesses, but I'm thinking about my next novel now.

37:20.655 --> 37:21.117
That's done.

37:21.197 --> 37:23.886
I love the line, that's completed work.

37:24.322 --> 37:26.224
And that's exactly what you're saying right here.

37:26.244 --> 37:26.985
You know, it's done.

37:27.005 --> 37:27.546
Next case.

37:27.686 --> 37:30.209
Let's get on to the next project.

37:30.650 --> 37:35.996
It's all a matter of the rungs of the ladder that you're climbing up on your own material.

37:36.056 --> 37:42.083
You were satisfied with it when you did it, and that has to be... And by and large, I'm satisfied with them today.

37:42.103 --> 37:45.007
But there are certainly images that embarrass me.

37:45.768 --> 37:49.032
And if I'm doing a public lecture, I never use.

37:51.174 --> 37:52.776
Of all the books I've done, there's one...

37:53.060 --> 37:53.521
image.

37:53.661 --> 37:55.483
There's one image.

37:55.503 --> 37:57.345
I made this point just the other night in a lecture.

37:57.946 --> 38:01.250
Because I don't see illustration as being the art of the book.

38:01.270 --> 38:05.135
Illustration is merely part, one part, of the art of the book.

38:05.876 --> 38:08.700
Before I do the illustrations, I do the design.

38:09.741 --> 38:11.163
I know what my margins are going to be.

38:11.183 --> 38:12.625
I know what my typeface is going to be.

38:12.645 --> 38:19.073
I know what the density of that texture, what we call, in typography, what's called color, and what the color of the page is going to be.

38:20.255 --> 38:21.396
We got all that figured out.

38:21.680 --> 38:24.544
long before I ever do an illustration.

38:24.865 --> 38:25.986
Then I have the typeset.

38:26.307 --> 38:30.252
I get galleys back, do all the editorial work, get all that stuff in place.

38:30.973 --> 38:32.496
Then build my dummy.

38:34.118 --> 38:40.127
Once I have the dummy built, when I start building the dummy, I simply fold up my sheets and start pasting it up.

38:40.347 --> 38:42.590
Okay, okay, now I want to illustrate this point here.

38:42.690 --> 38:44.954
Okay, so I'm going to illustrate, I put the illustration here.

38:45.434 --> 38:47.698
Or I leave myself this much space and then go on.

38:48.339 --> 38:51.383
I don't know what that's going to be, but I know it's going to be five lines

38:51.650 --> 38:55.395
deep, and I know it's going to be the full width, or I know it's going to be a full page.

38:55.415 --> 38:59.600
And I know that at that point I'm going to put in the scarecrow's brain.

38:59.640 --> 39:00.681
Okay, that's a question.

39:00.802 --> 39:04.947
So the design of the book almost dictates what the illustration is going to be.

39:04.967 --> 39:07.931
No, it doesn't dictate what they're going to be, but it's going to dictate their scale.

39:08.111 --> 39:09.172
How about the subject, though?

39:09.673 --> 39:10.894
Well, that'll come from the text.

39:10.934 --> 39:14.199
The text will tell me, okay, here I'm coming upon the scarecrow's brain.

39:14.219 --> 39:18.484
Okay, so I've got to... So now I leave myself about this much space to do the scarecrow's brain.

39:19.105 --> 39:23.450
And then I go on and do it up until I come to the next thing that I want to illustrate.

39:23.470 --> 39:24.852
Then I leave myself space there.

39:25.272 --> 39:31.480
And I think, well, Scarecrow's brains is not as important an image as, say, an image of Tim Woodman.

39:31.580 --> 39:33.602
So Tim Woodman will be a full page.

39:33.622 --> 39:36.305
This is only going to be a third of a page and that sort of thing.

39:37.086 --> 39:40.370
Then I go back and I start making my drawings.

39:41.051 --> 39:43.514
And then from the drawings I make the engravings.

39:43.534 --> 39:47.779
So the illustration is, in a sense, very much the last thing that happens.

39:48.383 --> 39:50.285
It has to fit into the mold.

39:50.786 --> 39:54.250
It fits into the pen that I have proscribed for myself.

39:54.290 --> 39:55.632
And you do your own wood engravings.

39:55.672 --> 39:56.834
And I do all that, yeah.

39:57.094 --> 40:16.078
And so in this lecture, the other day, I said to the audience that of all the work that I've done, all the hundreds of illustrations, there's one that I think can be extracted from the book and hung on a wall and exist as an object of art by itself with no reference to anything else.

40:16.868 --> 40:21.136
And that's the image of the castle of the Wicked Witch of the West.

40:22.438 --> 40:32.256
I did something in that print that I've never done before and haven't done since, in terms of technique and imagery.

40:32.276 --> 40:36.223
It works, it's just a nice piece, bicep, doesn't need what it is.

40:36.704 --> 40:39.990
But all the other things, you can't take them out of this.

40:40.173 --> 40:51.868
When I see an exhibit of my work in a gallery, it really bothers me because I see these black and white images around, and I want to see them on a page with type because that's the way they were envisioned.

40:51.888 --> 40:54.451
You're telling me something now for my layout, too, by the way.

40:54.932 --> 41:02.302
Maybe I'll reproduce a couple of entire pages as opposed to just... Well, but it would be on a page, though, you see.

41:02.322 --> 41:05.446
In a tabloid, in a newspaper, it'll be on a page.

41:05.466 --> 41:06.046
And that's fine.

41:06.207 --> 41:08.830
That's not discomforting at all.

41:09.451 --> 41:13.417
But when they're up there, you know, that's a different matter.

41:13.637 --> 41:16.881
I love the one you picked for your mantle, though.

41:16.961 --> 41:18.864
I don't even know where that came from.

41:19.024 --> 41:21.207
That came back from my show and got stuck up there.

41:21.227 --> 41:23.711
I don't want to take up too much of your time.

41:25.133 --> 41:26.335
Making the jump the jump.

41:27.076 --> 41:27.396
Color.

41:27.977 --> 41:28.357
Children.

41:29.599 --> 41:31.662
Is this something that somebody approached you with?

41:31.842 --> 41:32.423
Yeah, sure.

41:32.443 --> 41:34.306
Somebody asked a question.

41:34.947 --> 41:36.409
Would you be interested?

41:36.589 --> 41:38.091
Sure, I'm interested in doing anything.

41:38.746 --> 41:40.248
especially things I haven't done before.

41:41.148 --> 41:44.352
And, well, we need color.

41:44.732 --> 41:46.994
I said, no, big deal.

41:47.014 --> 41:50.758
I majored in painting in college, and I'm not a stranger to color.

41:50.778 --> 41:52.620
And I've been doing watercolors all my life.

41:52.640 --> 41:58.045
But did you apply the same interpretive skills that you've been... Yeah, it's a different game.

41:58.085 --> 42:06.694
You're playing, you use the Red Sox analogy, well, if I'm playing in that league with Huckleberry Finn,

42:07.400 --> 42:11.485
in Frankenstein, now I want to play Little League.

42:11.505 --> 42:16.772
It's the same game except that you're not playing with the same.

42:16.792 --> 42:21.398
Except I understand it's twenty-five, thirty-five thousand first printing.

42:21.418 --> 42:22.919
Isn't that sweet?

42:22.939 --> 42:25.483
The kid market can be very subjective, can't it?

42:25.683 --> 42:26.804
Boy, I'm telling you.

42:27.205 --> 42:30.589
Now here's the interesting thing, because as this happens,

42:30.974 --> 42:38.987
I'd never done children's books, never thought about doing children's books, and there's plenty of people say, what do you do, you know, so I meet casually, what do you do for a living?

42:39.007 --> 42:39.929
I illustrate books.

42:39.989 --> 42:41.872
Oh, children's books?

42:41.892 --> 42:49.845
No, no, classics mostly, you know, because as soon as you say you illustrate books, most people jump with conclusions, especially doing children's books.

42:49.865 --> 42:51.087
I never done one, never thought about it.

42:51.107 --> 42:56.796
When I had my luncheon with Jan Phillips, went over to her house after lunch, met her little baby boy, and, uh,

42:58.075 --> 43:06.184
I saw her collection of 19th Century 10 toys and stuff, and we got to talk about what a possible collaboration might be.

43:06.205 --> 43:10.109
She said, well, you know, one thing that I've always wanted to do is write a children's book.

43:10.129 --> 43:11.571
She had nothing of junk.

43:12.252 --> 43:13.693
Had no idea that I had any of that.

43:13.733 --> 43:15.455
I said, no shit.

43:15.475 --> 43:23.745
I said, this is really funny because, and I told a story, when I was in Jackson two weeks ago, sitting out having a

43:25.160 --> 43:37.555
a couple of drinks with Mel, who was John's wife, and Mel was saying, you know, Ellen Gilchrist was over the other night, because her, Ellen's grandson and their son play together, playmates, they live right near each other.

43:37.575 --> 43:43.802
She was over here the other night and she was talking about, you know, she was sorry that she wasn't going to be here when you were here and all that stuff.

43:43.822 --> 43:52.112
And she said, she told me to tell you that if you were ever interested in doing a children's book, she'd like to write one.

43:52.396 --> 43:55.620
is starting this whole business with the children's book now.

43:55.841 --> 43:57.163
William Kennedy just did one.

43:57.203 --> 43:58.064
Yeah, exactly.

43:58.625 --> 44:02.490
You tell me that, and James Dickey, of course, has done two or three.

44:03.211 --> 44:07.176
William Faulkner did one going back, but it's an attraction to do that.

44:07.196 --> 44:07.437
Sure.

44:08.098 --> 44:08.839
Absolutely.

44:08.899 --> 44:11.442
It's a whole little level of communication.

44:11.482 --> 44:17.230
You don't want to pander, and you don't want to step down, but you still want to connect.

44:17.390 --> 44:22.217
You still want to connect with your thought, intellectual thought and visual thought.

44:22.838 --> 44:31.613
All it amounts to is that I apply a little more humor, I think, more than anything else.

44:31.713 --> 44:38.585
It's just a little bit more of the lack evasable.

44:41.690 --> 44:47.901
The thing is that if I were to take any of the illustrations from Jones and do them as wood engraved,

44:50.058 --> 44:51.740
And it was precisely the same image.

44:51.760 --> 44:52.701
It changed the medium.

44:53.082 --> 44:53.522
Entirely.

44:54.083 --> 44:55.705
It would change the message.

44:56.025 --> 44:57.407
Well, they're a lot softer, I think.

44:57.507 --> 44:58.027
Exactly.

44:58.187 --> 45:10.262
And as soon as they become black and white, and wood engravings being so insistently black and white, people would immediately perceive them as being dark, just like they do my Alice illustration.

45:10.282 --> 45:17.890
Now, one of the areas I'm collecting, I've determined that there are at least 22 books that Winslow Homer.

45:18.271 --> 45:18.411
Mm-hmm.

45:19.268 --> 45:21.531
I've got about half a dozen of them so far.

45:21.551 --> 45:21.932
Oh, really?

45:22.633 --> 45:24.696
Well, the book people, I'll shut this up.

45:27.340 --> 45:39.639
It's just the one thing that you have to be aware of, is that a lot of what was illustrated with wood engraving was not printed from the blocks, but printed from electrotype.

45:39.659 --> 45:40.741
They do the same thing with type.

45:41.141 --> 45:44.787
They send the type by hand, make a proof of it, and then make an electrotype.

45:45.408 --> 45:49.094
That's what they do at newspapers now.

45:49.114 --> 45:50.396
I think it's all coal-type.

45:50.436 --> 45:51.839
Right, exactly.

45:51.899 --> 46:07.585
Except if they would do it, you would end up with a relief plate, so that you're printing it, you know, and pressing it into the paper, not making a lithographic surface.

46:08.510 --> 46:09.411
Are you a throwback?

46:09.451 --> 46:10.172
That's a question.

46:10.893 --> 46:10.993
What?

46:11.013 --> 46:11.594
A throwback.

46:11.714 --> 46:12.055
Am I?

46:12.155 --> 46:15.559
Yeah, to another era, another... God knows.

46:15.960 --> 46:16.360
I don't know.

46:17.101 --> 46:17.802
Maybe.

46:17.822 --> 46:19.605
Maybe I'm an anachronism.

46:19.785 --> 46:22.108
But then again, maybe I'm the avant-garde.

46:22.128 --> 46:25.052
Except that people certainly are responding to it.

46:26.133 --> 46:35.766
Whether or not illustration with books or contemporary books is something that's not being done, the fact is when you do it, when you do it, people are responding to it, and they want it.

46:36.269 --> 46:37.190
I really don't know.

46:37.270 --> 46:38.552
I don't know how to answer the question.

46:38.632 --> 46:44.721
It's not anything that I ever really concern myself with, whether I'm in the front or the rear or in the ranks.

46:45.862 --> 47:03.026
I do what I do because I love to do it and feel good in doing it and think that at this point I'm just now getting to the point where I have enough arrogance to think that I do something well, well enough to keep doing it.

47:03.046 --> 47:05.770
Arrogance is a big part of making life anyway.

47:07.117 --> 47:08.739
It has to be pretty arrogant.

47:08.959 --> 47:10.661
It has to be.

47:10.761 --> 47:14.606
You have to realize that your stuff is good.

47:14.626 --> 47:17.950
Because if you don't, who else is... Absolutely.

47:17.970 --> 47:29.163
I mean, if you don't think it's good... When I was teaching in school, people would ask me, even now, when I'm out on the lecture circuit, people would say, you know, I have a kid who's talented.

47:29.243 --> 47:34.189
What do you think I should... How do you think I should encourage this?

47:34.209 --> 47:36.111
I said, well, let me ask you quite a couple of questions.

47:37.154 --> 47:41.180
One, does your kid have unlimited energy?

47:43.603 --> 47:44.545
The answer is no.

47:44.565 --> 47:46.508
I'm going to tell your kid don't do it.

47:47.709 --> 47:49.432
But he's got a lot of talent.

47:49.452 --> 47:50.373
It doesn't matter.

47:50.393 --> 47:51.715
He doesn't have unlimited energy.

47:51.975 --> 47:55.541
He doesn't have the absolute determination and drive to do it.

47:55.941 --> 48:00.047
And if not satisfied doing anything else, tell him or her not to do it.

48:00.768 --> 48:01.730
But he's got a lot of talent.

48:01.950 --> 48:03.732
It doesn't matter.

48:03.933 --> 48:06.216
Talent's a little bit of weight, a lot of the necessary work.

48:06.922 --> 48:08.204
Everybody gets talent.

48:08.985 --> 48:10.286
It takes energy.

48:10.647 --> 48:11.488
It takes drive.

48:11.568 --> 48:12.529
It takes determination.

48:12.549 --> 48:14.051
It takes a little bit of arrogance.

48:14.071 --> 48:17.055
Yeah, well, you see, your quote is almost a little different from the Hemingway one.

48:17.636 --> 48:19.779
They asked him, what does it take to be a great writer?

48:20.139 --> 48:25.346
He said, the first thing is, there's no substitute for hard work.

48:25.627 --> 48:27.009
He said, work, work, work.

48:27.229 --> 48:30.033
You know, the second, unfortunately, is talent.

48:30.373 --> 48:30.713
Yeah.

48:30.733 --> 48:35.680
Well, he also said the most important thing with a young writer, I guess it's the most important thing with a young writer,

48:36.217 --> 48:38.959
can have is a built-in shockproof ship.

48:40.421 --> 48:41.802
That's good.

48:42.783 --> 48:44.384
Okay, I'm going to wrap it up.

48:44.424 --> 48:45.605
I think I've got plenty of stuff.

48:45.625 --> 48:53.852
Just one other thing about, is there something about wood engraving that is particularly appealing or attractive, say, to an adult audience?

48:53.872 --> 48:55.373
I mean, now you did color for the kids.

48:55.774 --> 48:57.415
Why didn't you do wood engravings for them?

48:57.555 --> 48:59.637
Because the publisher asked me what he wanted.

48:59.977 --> 49:03.140
So if you'd had your druthers, would you have done wood engravings?

49:03.720 --> 49:05.582
No, not particularly, because...

49:05.849 --> 49:11.754
I use wood engraving to do limited edition books, and we can print them on my press along with a type.

49:11.955 --> 49:13.656
So it's a functional thing, yeah.

49:13.676 --> 49:16.819
It's a functional medium for doing limited edition books.

49:17.019 --> 49:23.105
If I'm doing, like when we do the Robert Bryan group, I'll present HVJ with three packages when I finish this.

49:23.605 --> 49:31.072
I'll give them a book illustrated with original wood engraving, black and white with a little color and a typography project.

49:31.092 --> 49:31.913
That's one option.

49:32.473 --> 49:34.675
Second option, I'll take one set of the plays.

49:35.836 --> 49:40.141
and meticulously hand-color them.

49:40.161 --> 49:41.803
Then that'll be a second option.

49:41.964 --> 49:48.131
The third option will be I'll take each one of those illustrations and do it as a watercolor.

49:48.151 --> 49:51.956
So at HBJ, they will have a choice in how they want to go with it.

49:52.917 --> 49:57.022
And they can do it as a facsimile of my edition, which would be just black and white.

49:57.042 --> 49:59.626
Or they can do it black and white with a color, you know.

50:00.126 --> 50:04.712
Let's see, what's the deal that you usually write in a year, at least a year, before they can come out to trade?

50:05.232 --> 50:07.716
I can do a book.

50:07.756 --> 50:09.899
You've done one simultaneous I know.

50:10.460 --> 50:21.656
I can probably get a book out, designed and illustrated, if I have read it at least a year ahead.

50:21.676 --> 50:25.362
I can do it in about three or four months.

50:26.423 --> 50:32.472
If I have control over design,

50:32.857 --> 50:36.402
and no interference from the publishers.

50:36.422 --> 50:37.604
And you pick good publishers.

50:38.625 --> 50:40.889
UCAL is unique.

50:40.909 --> 50:41.490
They're wonderful.

50:41.570 --> 50:42.892
And HBJ is nice.

50:43.112 --> 50:44.194
And Houghton's a nice company.

50:44.294 --> 50:46.036
Now that little book is kind of an odd one.

50:46.076 --> 50:47.639
Yeah, it is an odd duck.

50:47.779 --> 50:51.504
The check clears the check clears.

50:51.624 --> 50:52.586
The check clears.

50:52.606 --> 51:00.197
We were sitting up there on that counter there and the editors were here and we were

51:00.937 --> 51:01.838
You know, what do you want?

51:01.858 --> 51:05.702
Well, we've got— Did Houghton come to you for that one?

51:05.722 --> 51:06.763
Yeah, so— But they're a nice house.

51:06.883 --> 51:09.425
Yeah, they do exactly what they want.

51:09.445 --> 51:11.187
And I said, well, it depends on three things.

51:12.068 --> 51:12.849
One is timing.

51:13.349 --> 51:15.331
And there they really screwed me up.

51:15.351 --> 51:17.293
They said, well, we need it by March.

51:17.653 --> 51:20.116
And I said, fine, so that fits right in the mind.

51:20.136 --> 51:20.556
I can do it.

51:21.617 --> 51:23.479
Well, then things got screwed up.

51:23.539 --> 51:26.942
And they were nine or ten months delivering anything in some manuscript.

51:27.623 --> 51:29.925
And I told them, they deliver parts of it.

51:29.945 --> 51:30.606
I don't work together.

51:31.244 --> 51:33.186
You've got to give me the whole manuscript.

51:33.206 --> 51:36.510
I've got to have the whole thing before I can start.

51:36.530 --> 51:42.598
And my other thing was timing, money, and artistic control.

51:42.618 --> 51:49.666
As long as I have control, the price goes down.

51:50.688 --> 51:59.158
When I have to go through committees, and the price goes up, and it goes up in proportion to the number of people that sit on that committee.

52:00.185 --> 52:06.513
Now, if I had to assign people proving something, my price is always kind of outrageous.

52:06.533 --> 52:07.954
That's about what you'd be.

52:07.974 --> 52:08.295
It's a nuisance.

52:08.315 --> 52:15.223
But that's why, usually in my conversation with people now, I say, look, you've come to me because you've seen my work.

52:15.403 --> 52:16.285
That's what you want.

52:16.325 --> 52:20.109
You've seen this, and that's the style, that's the look that you want.

52:20.129 --> 52:21.451
Let's go away and leave me alone.

52:22.031 --> 52:26.597
And I'll give you something that you'll be proud of and you'll be happy with, but don't tell me how to do my work.

52:28.653 --> 52:32.278
And it works for everybody except Madison Avenue.

52:32.298 --> 52:33.760
I love it.

52:33.780 --> 52:35.042
Now go away and leave me alone.

52:38.406 --> 52:45.115
I get really a lot of stuff, so I'm going to shut this off.

52:45.376 --> 52:49.842
You have included yourself, you say, in every book?

52:49.862 --> 52:52.125
Yeah, there's a self-portrait in every book since Moby Dick.

52:52.665 --> 52:53.446
And why is that?

52:53.526 --> 52:55.770
Is this ego again, or is this your signature?

52:56.210 --> 52:58.373
I did it in Moby Dick, and...

52:58.994 --> 53:00.035
I don't know, it appealed to me.

53:00.155 --> 53:03.780
I like the idea of doing it and have just done it ever since.

53:03.920 --> 53:05.742
Yeah, it's more of a signature than anything.

53:06.583 --> 53:12.230
It's the presence, you know, it's like Alfred Hitchcock walking through water.

53:12.470 --> 53:18.177
And you've got people, other people that you've known, other people that you... People I like, there are little in-jokes that you do.

53:19.119 --> 53:20.901
That doesn't detract from the work in any way.

53:20.921 --> 53:22.723
It's not even important.

53:23.108 --> 53:34.743
In Wizard of Oz, for instance, you know, it's just four political figures, you know, from Reagan and Lee Iacocca and Gene Kirkpatrick and Jerry Falwell and all that whole thing.

53:34.763 --> 53:41.632
It neither does anything for the tech centers to do anything yet, but it's just my sense of play.

53:41.652 --> 53:45.497
I think it was Gertrude who said, I entertain myself with myself.

53:45.517 --> 53:46.258
That's good.

53:46.399 --> 53:47.981
And I do that.

53:48.161 --> 53:49.723
That's entertainment for me.
