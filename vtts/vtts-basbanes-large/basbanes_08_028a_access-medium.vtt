WEBVTT

00:03.018 --> 00:07.943
How can I even mind that?

00:09.405 --> 00:09.765
I guess.

00:11.387 --> 00:17.774
It's ridiculous for me to discuss the novel itself in any great detail.

00:17.834 --> 00:19.155
It's my job, of course, to read it.

00:20.036 --> 00:23.179
But undoubtedly, we will get into it.

00:23.199 --> 00:29.266
But I guess, what advice would you give to a reader coming to Alice Walker for the first time?

00:30.327 --> 00:31.388
Open-minded man.

00:34.034 --> 00:42.584
Would you suggest that a reader read you chronologically?

00:44.446 --> 00:46.889
Is it a corpus, in your view?

00:48.210 --> 00:52.555
Well, it could be interesting, but I think they should just follow their own curiosity.

00:53.296 --> 00:59.603
You know, some books are for you at a particular time, for the reader at a particular time, not necessarily forever.

01:00.460 --> 01:02.542
And that's how I read.

01:02.562 --> 01:11.430
I don't necessarilyâ€”if I fall in love with the writer, I will then read everything, starting at the beginning and going up to where I dived in.

01:12.491 --> 01:26.805
But, you know, follow your curiosity, think about where you are and what you might learn, you know, what questions you have at the time that you encounter my work.

01:27.292 --> 01:30.799
And for me, actually, books just fall off the shelf when I need them.

01:31.400 --> 01:32.803
I love that.

01:32.903 --> 01:33.724
That's a good way.

01:34.626 --> 01:37.211
You mean in terms of books that you need to read?

01:37.832 --> 01:39.275
They always come.

01:39.536 --> 01:42.401
I'm just writing a piece right now about associative browsing.

01:42.461 --> 01:44.104
It's a brand new phrase that I've run into.

01:44.425 --> 01:47.511
I love to browse in libraries, but it is extraordinary.

01:48.183 --> 01:49.988
how you can discover a book.

01:50.489 --> 01:51.171
It's uncanny.

01:51.432 --> 01:55.664
That's precisely the book that you're looking for, and you've never heard of it before, including the author.

01:55.684 --> 01:59.535
The author is unknown to you, and the work is unknown, and it's precisely what you're looking for.

01:59.555 --> 02:02.884
Well, actually, you know, libraries are like a giant I Ching.

02:03.488 --> 02:04.369
I like that, too.

02:04.389 --> 02:13.944
I'm writing a new book about libraries through history and of the future, so every time I get a new quote, I put it into the... Could you expand on that a little bit?

02:13.964 --> 02:24.040
Well, it's just, you know, how the I Ching, I mean, I used to just religiously do the I Ching, you know, the way you're supposed to, you know, with the coins, and it works, you know, the I Ching is a magical book, and it works.

02:24.781 --> 02:29.749
But now I realize that if I do it, because I often don't have time to do the whole procedure,

02:30.303 --> 02:32.605
I just opened the book, and there it is.

02:34.407 --> 02:35.928
So that's how books come.

02:35.948 --> 02:36.409
Yeah.

02:36.429 --> 02:43.035
I read a really wonderful interview of you, and actually your publisher furnished it in Ms.

02:43.075 --> 02:44.377
Magazine.

02:44.397 --> 02:45.518
Oh, Ms., uh-huh, yeah.

02:45.538 --> 02:52.104
But I hadn't realized, but of course I should have, that how important reading was to you, even as a very little girl, I guess.

02:52.364 --> 02:52.785
Oh, yes.

02:52.805 --> 02:53.826
Oh, I loved it.

02:53.846 --> 02:55.187
Were you an eclectic reader?

02:55.588 --> 03:00.192
Oh, well, I read whatever came into our house, and not many books came into our house.

03:00.627 --> 03:18.928
But the ones that came were really potent because we had, you know, there was a double volume old collection called Prose and Poetry, and it had all of the, you know, Hawthorne and Melville and everybody, you know, all the old classics.

03:18.948 --> 03:20.991
And that was, that's the way they gave it to us.

03:21.611 --> 03:22.873
And that was where I lived.

03:22.893 --> 03:25.416
I lived in those volumes for a long time.

03:25.436 --> 03:25.596
Okay.

03:25.616 --> 03:28.980
And you were the youngest of eight siblings.

03:29.382 --> 03:31.044
And were you a reading family?

03:31.064 --> 03:32.005
Were you a family of readers?

03:32.105 --> 03:42.175
Well, yes, but my parents were not very well educated, so their reading was most of the newspaper and the Bible and the catalogs and things like that.

03:42.215 --> 03:43.016
They loved it.

03:43.056 --> 03:47.440
They loved the magic of reading and insisted that all of us read.

03:47.841 --> 03:54.107
And that was why they were so, I think, really happy to build a school for us.

03:54.408 --> 03:56.109
I read that about the building of the school.

03:56.190 --> 03:57.791
Isn't that incredible?

03:57.811 --> 03:58.852
That's a wonderful story.

03:58.872 --> 03:59.352
Isn't that incredible?

03:59.392 --> 04:00.273
Oh, it's so wonderful.

04:00.353 --> 04:01.054
I love it.

04:01.594 --> 04:06.859
And in fact, there's a woman who's doing a biography of me, and I had protested.

04:06.959 --> 04:14.885
And then my brother, who was a Bostonian who lived here, got leukemia and died.

04:15.606 --> 04:23.773
And the year and a half of his life before his death, I realized that indeed I did need a biographer because

04:24.378 --> 04:28.383
You know, people were dying all the time, and especially this brother who had all these stories.

04:28.443 --> 04:35.792
And in fact, that story about my parents and the community building the school was one of the many stories that he contributed.

04:36.774 --> 04:46.646
And there was a newspaper clip that we lost that had a photo of me at four years old and my brother who was, I guess, 14 or whatever.

04:47.707 --> 04:48.969
And I'm sitting on the well.

04:49.029 --> 04:50.671
You know, we've done a well.

04:50.711 --> 04:52.253
They've done a well for this little school.

04:53.515 --> 04:53.895
Priceless.

04:54.179 --> 05:00.225
So, I don't know where I was going with that, but, you know, it was good for me.

05:00.245 --> 05:02.067
I'd like to get straight.

05:02.248 --> 05:04.450
Where did you get books for the school, I guess?

05:05.111 --> 05:09.055
Well, unfortunately, but, you know, what do we do?

05:09.235 --> 05:20.507
They were the cast-off books from the white school, which means that they were totally, you know, biased and not very good for the spirit, but they had all the

05:20.875 --> 05:21.776
essential things.

05:21.836 --> 05:26.121
You could still read them, and math was colorless and so forth.

05:26.141 --> 05:28.304
But history was decidedly the white man's history, wasn't it?

05:28.324 --> 05:29.465
Oh, the history was dreadful.

05:29.685 --> 05:30.866
I remember... I'm sorry, go ahead.

05:31.027 --> 05:41.659
Yeah, I remember that the illustrations for the black people, they just had a, you know, their idea of an African, you know, with some big lips and foul teeth and cooking some missionary in the pot.

05:41.679 --> 05:43.020
I mean, it was just that literal.

05:43.621 --> 05:48.807
The Indian was, you know, doing something, quote, savage, and, you know, I mean, it was just...

05:49.040 --> 05:55.128
And then there they were, you know, they were... Do you know Charles Blockson?

05:56.069 --> 05:56.429
Yes.

05:56.529 --> 05:58.091
I wrote about Charles in my last book.

05:58.131 --> 05:59.573
I wrote a book called The Gentle Madness.

05:59.653 --> 06:01.115
It was about the bibliomania.

06:01.816 --> 06:06.061
And Charles was one of my great principal characters.

06:06.462 --> 06:07.243
I love him.

06:07.663 --> 06:14.732
This is a man who had a guaranteed football contract in the 50s, right, with the New York Giants.

06:15.313 --> 06:17.916
And I interviewed Lenny Moore, his good friend and roommate, and Lenny said,

06:18.217 --> 06:22.161
A black kid today, you only get one chance, maybe.

06:22.181 --> 06:25.744
Imagine giving up, in the 50s, a shot to be a pro player.

06:25.784 --> 06:30.489
And the reason was, and Charles says, to be a black bibliophile.

06:30.669 --> 06:31.330
Those are his words.

06:31.370 --> 06:38.837
And the reason for that is that when he was a kid in school, he asked a teacher, how come there were never any black people in the history books?

06:38.857 --> 06:41.660
And she said, Charles, black people have no history.

06:41.760 --> 06:47.245
And that's kind of what makes me think of this as your recollection of

06:47.360 --> 06:49.663
of your school in these books.

06:49.723 --> 06:56.233
And he said, well, boy, if I have no history, then what were all those stories my grandfather was telling me about the underground railroad?

06:56.253 --> 06:57.054
That's not history.

06:57.855 --> 06:59.778
I had no idea that he had had this.

07:00.038 --> 07:03.122
No, because now I think of his build, Charles Bloxham.

07:03.183 --> 07:04.224
He certainly could have been.

07:04.645 --> 07:05.686
Oh, he was known.

07:06.047 --> 07:08.450
He was at Penn State.

07:08.510 --> 07:11.915
His roommates were Rosie Greer and Lenny Moore.

07:11.995 --> 07:13.317
He played on the same team.

07:13.887 --> 07:42.392
He was a track star, and I tell the story in my book how he, and then he had all these great skills, and then one day they went to New York for a track beat, and while Rosie and Lenny were out checking out the women, he took the A train, and he says, I took the A train to Harlem and went to the Schaumburg Library and walked in, it gives me goose pimples, and he said, and as soon as I walked in, he said, I knew I wasn't alone.

07:42.625 --> 07:50.156
And that was the model for him, was to build a kind of a Schaumburg collection, which, in fact, he did, which is now a temple.

07:50.797 --> 07:57.908
And so he spent, you know, he devoted his life to putting together this library, which is what is now 80,000 volumes.

08:00.291 --> 08:11.147
And I've seen kids, little kids, walk in because of the genealogy that come in to, and he starts explaining, you know, lineage and history, and you see these eyes.

08:12.005 --> 08:15.868
Anyway, I'm sorry to go off on this tangent.

08:16.149 --> 08:17.390
But how is he?

08:17.410 --> 08:18.210
Have you seen him lately?

08:18.230 --> 08:18.951
I just talked to him.

08:19.011 --> 08:20.933
He called me last week.

08:21.773 --> 08:25.436
He wrote his autobiography, which is being published, and he wants to send me a copy.

08:26.757 --> 08:28.039
And I'll write a little review of it.

08:28.199 --> 08:29.480
I'm happy to do it.

08:29.500 --> 08:31.321
So I just talked to him last week.

08:31.341 --> 08:31.722
He's fine.

08:31.822 --> 08:32.442
He sounds great.

08:32.462 --> 08:33.663
Send him my love and admiration.

08:33.683 --> 08:34.604
I will indeed.

08:34.624 --> 08:35.465
I absolutely will.

08:35.765 --> 08:41.590
He has mentioned, you know, he has all of your, obviously everything that you've done in his library.

08:41.772 --> 08:50.222
But to go back to the open-mindedness, why is open-mindedness particularly necessary in your work?

08:50.242 --> 08:56.770
Well, because my worldview is so different from the one that most people in this culture have.

08:57.331 --> 09:05.641
And, you know, if they would have a minute to think about it, it would be easy to see why that would be absolutely necessary.

09:06.102 --> 09:11.408
There's no reason why my worldview should resemble, you know, people who are

09:11.860 --> 09:20.573
at the material top of the culture, both racially and financially.

09:22.456 --> 09:23.818
And I think gender is a factor, too.

09:23.838 --> 09:24.900
And gender is a factor.

09:26.943 --> 09:39.943
And so, rather than just get disgruntled, as people seem to get occasionally, open-mindedness would help allow for a certain spaciousness.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.457
And saying, oh, this is a different world view.

09:42.718 --> 09:46.386
You know, this is someone who doesn't see it the way that I do.

09:46.666 --> 09:48.169
And then what does that mean?

09:48.209 --> 09:48.650
What is it?

09:50.033 --> 09:55.324
You know, you have to approach writers like me, I think, the way that you would approach other cultures.

09:56.046 --> 09:58.531
Because it is, I do come from another culture.

09:58.551 --> 10:00.936
I mean, even though I'm in this one.

10:02.553 --> 10:04.275
So that's what I mean.

10:04.295 --> 10:06.078
I'm sorry, what do you mean, come from another culture?

10:06.138 --> 10:07.159
Could you define a culture?

10:07.179 --> 10:07.640
Well, yes.

10:07.900 --> 10:15.070
I come from a very distinctive southern black culture pre-integration in my formative years.

10:16.531 --> 10:28.307
A culture that was still very much oral, very much devoted to music, very much still a community.

10:29.654 --> 10:35.961
And a culture that actually believed that we could do whatever we set our minds and hearts to.

10:35.981 --> 10:37.043
That was the message.

10:37.143 --> 10:38.444
That was clear as anything.

10:38.745 --> 10:47.315
There was no self-pitying about, you know, I listened to myself actually talking about, you know, being poor in a sense.

10:47.435 --> 10:50.078
You know, poor like we didn't have what the white people had.

10:50.098 --> 10:52.801
But honestly, I can't say that in my heart I felt poor.

10:54.343 --> 10:58.007
Because there was the richness of the daily life.

10:58.797 --> 11:00.359
Now you're writing out of that culture?

11:01.561 --> 11:02.883
Well, it's my foundation.

11:03.323 --> 11:09.432
It's my foundation, and then it connects me to Indigenous people, because I definitely feel very Indigenous.

11:10.093 --> 11:23.111
I feel like my Native American ancestry, you know, married to my African ancestry, married to my European ancestry, means that I am Indigenous and unique to this continent in a way that very few people are.

11:24.012 --> 11:25.935
And that's true of many, you know, um,

11:26.742 --> 11:31.967
For this new novel, you created a people.

11:32.127 --> 11:35.170
Why was that necessary?

11:35.791 --> 11:55.990
Well, they needed to exist, and I also feel that they exist in me, and that I am a seed of that people, and a seed of that particular worldview, which is very different from the Judeo-Christian worldview that was imposed on people of color around the globe, and white people, too.

11:56.273 --> 12:25.251
um and so i uh for my own spirit you know there's a one one of the people that i really love is black elk and his notion his people's notion actually is a very ancient notion is that if you have a vision of how it all hangs together your job is to manifest it so people can see it and if you don't do that then you lose the opportunity to expand

12:25.771 --> 12:29.155
the vision of the collective.

12:29.596 --> 12:31.017
And it's not a competitive vision.

12:31.718 --> 12:34.982
He calls it the great vision, but it's your great vision.

12:35.002 --> 12:39.007
It's not one that's greater than Susan's.

12:39.888 --> 12:43.272
And I think that in creating these people, that's part of what I'm doing.

12:43.392 --> 12:52.723
I'm saying that this is my vision of what can be, and what may already have been.

12:53.328 --> 12:55.131
You're looking very amused.

12:55.151 --> 12:55.772
No, no, I'm not.

12:55.792 --> 12:58.457
I'm listening to you and actually thinking ahead to my next question.

12:58.557 --> 12:59.158
I'm sorry.

12:59.859 --> 13:00.821
What is your next question?

13:00.841 --> 13:01.282
No, no, no.

13:01.702 --> 13:03.245
That's the problem with these things, you know.

13:03.265 --> 13:09.055
In the old days, I used to take very feverish notes, and of course, then you hung on every word, but now with the tape recorder.

13:09.115 --> 13:11.199
Right, just let it go.

13:11.219 --> 13:12.280
And it's so tiny, too.

13:12.301 --> 13:12.942
Isn't that wonderful?

13:12.962 --> 13:15.426
And it gets two hours, too.

13:15.446 --> 13:17.850
It automatically reverses itself in the...

13:18.337 --> 13:20.319
It's a little bit of this, yeah.

13:20.399 --> 13:21.801
It's really great.

13:21.901 --> 13:23.342
Oh, beautiful.

13:23.402 --> 13:24.323
It's so small.

13:24.403 --> 13:25.424
I'm not amused at all.

13:25.444 --> 13:26.706
I hope I didn't.

13:26.726 --> 13:28.147
I just smiled a lot.

13:28.167 --> 13:28.327
Good.

13:28.347 --> 13:29.268
Well, that's wonderful.

13:29.328 --> 13:33.252
Yeah, I do, too.

13:33.292 --> 13:33.753
I'm sorry.

13:33.853 --> 13:34.994
Now I lost my track here.

13:38.678 --> 13:40.540
This grew out of the creation of people.

13:41.561 --> 13:43.923
This question, your response, grew out of my question.

13:43.943 --> 13:47.787
And your previous response had described

13:48.813 --> 13:51.176
a uniqueness for yourself.

13:51.236 --> 13:56.544
I wonder why you couldn't have used this unique background of your own.

13:56.784 --> 14:00.950
Or maybe you did in the creation of this people in Mexico.

14:00.970 --> 14:11.866
Well, there's also the historical fact of all of these Africans, African Americans, and Native Americans from the United States who fled to Mexico.

14:12.567 --> 14:15.411
I mean, that has happened, you know, over and over and over and over.

14:15.965 --> 14:26.095
and before the Civil War, during the Civil War, and after the Civil War because, you know, people were looking for freedom, looking for land, looking for a place to be.

14:27.556 --> 14:44.352
And I've always been fascinated by those people and by that notion of just walking away as soon as you could from a terrible situation and striking out for the unknown, but, you know, having a vision that there is something different and better.

14:45.327 --> 14:47.389
This is the first novel in six years.

14:48.831 --> 14:50.453
Have you been working on it for six years?

14:51.174 --> 14:57.160
No, my last novel was Possessing the Secret of Joy, about female genital mutilation.

14:58.021 --> 15:01.305
And then after that, I made a film about it.

15:02.026 --> 15:07.432
And I then wrote a book with the filmmaker about making a film.

15:07.532 --> 15:11.957
And we took the film all over this country, Europe, Africa.

15:12.357 --> 15:14.760
I mean, not all over Africa, but places where we could.

15:15.398 --> 15:15.879
show it.

15:17.762 --> 15:31.243
And then I wrote another book called The Same River Twice, because I got really deeply interested in what having a film made from my book, A Color Purple, meant to me.

15:31.884 --> 15:35.590
People always say, well, what do you think about, you know, the movie?

15:36.251 --> 15:42.300
And it's actually, you know, the response would take a long time.

15:42.584 --> 15:43.945
So you wrote a book about it.

15:43.965 --> 15:44.165
Oh, I did.

15:44.286 --> 15:46.167
And it really, you know... I'll have to check it out.

15:46.247 --> 15:47.128
It was very helpful.

15:47.148 --> 15:55.536
And I certainly, I know we've only got a brief amount of time here, so I don't want to... So the color purple is something that I'll write about, you know, from background.

15:55.716 --> 15:56.037
Right.

15:56.197 --> 15:58.579
But that is your, that response is in that book.

15:58.799 --> 15:59.240
Oh, yeah.

15:59.260 --> 16:00.060
That's what it's about.

16:00.641 --> 16:10.330
But it's a very philosophical look at what happens when a creative person is sort of yanked out of the solitude of solitary creativity.

16:10.782 --> 16:17.909
and plop down into the middle of a really large collective creative force, which is movie making.

16:19.091 --> 16:20.992
Well, with the novel, you're totally in control.

16:21.573 --> 16:22.014
It's yours.

16:22.254 --> 16:22.574
Right.

16:23.335 --> 16:24.536
There's a lot of letting go.

16:24.576 --> 16:35.187
There's a lot of, you know, acceptance, and there's a lot of growth, because there's something about working with the collective that it helps you to

16:35.926 --> 16:38.709
just start to feel all of your facets and your sides.

16:38.789 --> 16:42.473
But creatively, how is it creatively?

16:42.654 --> 16:49.962
I mean, I've never heard of a work of art being produced by a committee with the possible exception of the King James Bible, you know.

16:49.982 --> 16:56.089
Well, it's not really a committee because a director like Steven Spielberg is, you know, in charge, totally.

16:56.550 --> 17:05.680
And so it's more like beginning to be able to see the vision that you create

17:06.453 --> 17:16.043
how to reflect it through somebody else's lens and learning to appreciate what they bring to it out of their own unique place in the world.

17:17.244 --> 17:23.030
Do you have a, so clearly you've been a very busy woman over the past six years.

17:23.671 --> 17:26.414
Maybe you could just tell me a little bit about the genesis of this novel.

17:26.634 --> 17:28.556
Does it start with a story for you?

17:28.616 --> 17:31.539
Because I think that you, the novel serves a lot of functions for you.

17:31.599 --> 17:35.683
I mean, it's, to suggest that an Alice Walker novel is a, is a, is

17:36.288 --> 17:42.356
Just a story, I think, is missing a point by a wide margin.

17:42.376 --> 18:03.983
Well, it did start in Possessing the Secret of Joy, the earlier novel, because I realized that just the literal attack on female sexuality that I was encountering, that women have endured for maybe 6,000 years, where this practiced FGM is still going on,

18:04.773 --> 18:28.948
I felt very much in need of a refreshment of my spirit, and I needed to affirm sexuality as a good, and the female body is alive and vibrant and positive, and sexuality as a vital, connected force to one's spiritual life.

18:31.251 --> 18:34.155
So that's how it started.

18:34.827 --> 18:43.555
This novel possessing The Secret of Joy, the truth of it is so heavy.

18:44.175 --> 18:46.417
And of course, many people just outright denied it.

18:46.678 --> 18:50.721
It was a long period when people said, oh, this doesn't happen.

18:50.781 --> 18:52.723
And if it does happen, it only happens to ten people.

18:53.884 --> 18:55.766
Why do you want to mention this anyway?

18:55.866 --> 18:57.907
Because it's so hard.

18:59.529 --> 19:03.012
People already think negative things about whoever.

19:03.835 --> 19:10.546
Why is the form of the novel so important in this particular... I mean, you write in any number of different literary forms.

19:10.726 --> 19:14.232
You're a non-fiction writer, you're an essayist, you're a poet, fiction writer.

19:14.833 --> 19:19.220
What was there about fiction that made it appropriate in this particular case?

19:19.240 --> 19:25.470
Fiction is absolutely so wonderful because it permits you to create an object, the novel, or the story.

19:26.692 --> 19:29.877
And this object can exist

19:30.667 --> 19:33.049
in a way that is distant from the reader.

19:33.169 --> 19:37.153
I mean, it's not, you're not just saying, this happened to me, and you have to, you know.

19:37.793 --> 19:40.496
It's basically saying, this is a work of art.

19:40.516 --> 19:44.299
And you study it and feel it at your leisure.

19:45.741 --> 19:47.502
And if you have a response, great.

19:47.582 --> 19:48.683
And if you don't, fine.

19:49.324 --> 19:51.286
You know, fiction is like that.

19:51.386 --> 19:52.447
It really frees you.

19:53.308 --> 19:57.011
And it also is the kind of thing that waits for you.

19:57.031 --> 20:00.454
If you're not ready for a work of fiction, you know, at 16,

20:01.025 --> 20:05.673
At 32, at 57, wait a few years, and it'll be there.

20:06.034 --> 20:07.657
How important is story to you?

20:08.118 --> 20:08.498
Very.

20:09.540 --> 20:11.744
I come from a long line of storytellers.

20:11.764 --> 20:15.591
I know that, you know, people can get bored.

20:16.052 --> 20:17.234
I mean, I get bored myself.

20:17.454 --> 20:20.199
That's why all of my novels are different.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.543
And why chronology is not that appealing to me.

20:22.827 --> 20:27.171
Well, certainly this novel life is pretty clear, too, I think.

20:27.772 --> 20:28.612
I'm sorry to interrupt.

20:28.673 --> 20:31.695
Yeah, it's more like circles for me, spirals.

20:33.857 --> 20:49.392
It just feels more alive to me, and it also permits a very wonderful feeling of interconnectedness and growing with the book and growing with the understanding of the people.

20:49.760 --> 20:51.522
And multiple narrative voices here.

20:51.662 --> 20:52.903
That seems appropriate.

20:52.923 --> 20:53.243
Oh, yeah.

20:53.263 --> 20:57.827
It's like music.

20:58.868 --> 21:13.200
People who read, actually, and live in our culture and have music in their lives, I think appreciate work that is challenging in that way.

21:13.220 --> 21:15.703
It really is like music.

21:16.383 --> 21:18.585
There's one chord, and then there's another chord.

21:18.633 --> 21:20.475
And then you start to see how they play together.

21:21.436 --> 21:22.497
And that appeals to me.

21:22.517 --> 21:27.641
Do you have a sense of your reader when you're writing?

21:27.801 --> 21:31.645
I mean, your constituency is legion and devoted to that.

21:31.665 --> 21:44.597
Well, I always think of people with very lively minds and really engaged hearts, and people who really want to cultivate a certain amount of fearlessness.

21:44.617 --> 21:47.239
Do you think your reader primarily is female?

21:48.164 --> 21:50.206
Oh, my readership is, definitely.

21:50.626 --> 21:54.149
But there are many, many more men now, and I'm very happy to see that.

21:54.510 --> 21:56.151
Are they responding?

21:56.271 --> 21:57.252
Do they feel less threatened?

21:57.512 --> 22:07.902
Yes, because a lot of them by now have been raised by feminist mothers, and there is just not that same fear that they are about to be bashed.

22:09.143 --> 22:16.990
And also by now many of them have seen me, met me, read me, and they see that we're on the same...

22:17.290 --> 22:20.113
the same side, which is the side of life.

22:21.135 --> 22:26.161
I normally don't ask writers to respond to reviews, and I'm not necessarily doing that here.

22:26.221 --> 22:36.073
But, I mean, if I hadn't read the book, but if I were to go by, say, the New York Times review, and then the review that was in the Globe, I'd swear that they were writing about two different books.

22:36.093 --> 22:39.737
Of course, one is written by a female, and the other is written by a male.

22:40.730 --> 22:42.712
Can you explain why that is?

22:43.373 --> 22:45.995
Why we're talking about two entirely different readings of the book?

22:46.015 --> 22:46.836
I don't know, but you know what?

22:46.856 --> 22:51.160
I don't read reviews until three months after, so I won't know until three months.

22:51.340 --> 22:54.143
So you don't know what I'm talking about here?

22:54.163 --> 22:54.463
No, no.

22:54.483 --> 22:55.024
Just as well.

22:55.044 --> 22:55.945
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

22:55.965 --> 22:57.006
That's what my agent told me.

22:57.026 --> 23:04.573
And I can't say that, you know, that's unexpected, because everything I have written has been, you know, very much from my own point of view.

23:05.654 --> 23:09.538
And, um, and not, you know, and very uncompromising.

23:10.632 --> 23:22.492
And so I feel that, you know, lucky for me, I do have a very large readership that is very devoted and that is willing to try to see what I'm talking about.

23:23.614 --> 23:25.397
And that's, you know, that's wonderful.

23:27.300 --> 23:28.482
So you don't read reviews.

23:28.722 --> 23:31.166
Is this to steel yourself against whatever?

23:31.206 --> 23:33.530
Well, I read them about three months later.

23:34.071 --> 23:35.273
So after the...

23:35.692 --> 23:45.103
Well, it's because... That would be kind of fun, actually, to read them as a body, too, as opposed to one here and one there, and avoiding the highs and the lows.

23:45.123 --> 23:46.825
Well, I just learned that over time.

23:46.885 --> 24:04.686
I've been writing that for 30 years, and I've learned that, you know, it doesn't do a lot good to read them, especially when you're on the road, you know, you're tired, you're doing something every night, having interviews every day, you're away from your dog and your home and your food, and

24:05.358 --> 24:06.379
You know, what good is it to?

24:06.960 --> 24:09.063
What would, you know, certainly father is in the title.

24:09.905 --> 24:13.249
Men are decidedly part of this book.

24:14.091 --> 24:15.593
What would you say to somebody like me?

24:15.853 --> 24:21.661
What would you hope that I, a 55-year-old father of two teenage daughters, would take away from this book?

24:21.802 --> 24:22.643
Okay, great.

24:22.663 --> 24:25.767
You're an ideal person.

24:26.468 --> 24:33.238
The thought that father-daughter solidarity is the most evolutionary thing there is.

24:35.294 --> 24:40.459
that you have the opportunity, by your relationship with your daughters, to change the world.

24:41.860 --> 25:03.580
And if you can think of your daughters, when they reach puberty and enter young womanhood, as autonomous beings, whom you fully support in their autonomy, which is, first of all, complete control of their own bodies, if you can do this, and if fathers everywhere would do this, we would change the world.

25:04.285 --> 25:07.009
It would be a different world.

25:07.029 --> 25:21.931
And, of course, you say, and you point out, that you have these fathers who totally intend to deny their daughters the same joy and sexuality that, you know, we've certainly enjoyed.

25:21.951 --> 25:22.172
Absolutely.

25:22.192 --> 25:24.235
And even younger than my own kids are, you know.

25:24.315 --> 25:26.498
I mean, they're 17 and 15, well, whatever.

25:26.538 --> 25:29.162
But I see...

25:29.733 --> 25:31.395
They're growing up for their women.

25:31.715 --> 25:32.135
Absolutely.

25:32.216 --> 25:32.896
Totally.

25:33.237 --> 25:45.910
I mean, and it's so hypocritical to say, well, you know, it's all right for me, it's all right for boys, but it's not for you, and in fact, you don't even have those women, which is what, you know, millions of songs do everywhere.

25:45.930 --> 25:55.199
And it's at that point, then, that the daughter is abused, frightened, you know, feels bad about her body, and it's just not necessary.

25:56.160 --> 25:58.643
There's a quote, you say,

25:59.315 --> 26:02.939
The spiritual growth and sexuality.

26:03.119 --> 26:08.805
And then I wonder if I have those... I want you to just expand on that a little bit for me.

26:09.366 --> 26:09.967
Okay.

26:10.287 --> 26:16.334
Well, I fully believe that it is through the free expression of our sexuality that we gain self-knowledge.

26:16.794 --> 26:20.498
I mean, obviously it's not the only place, but it's one of the major ones.

26:21.739 --> 26:25.003
And that self-knowledge is enlightenment.

26:25.023 --> 26:27.786
So to deny people the full expression of their sexuality...

26:28.154 --> 26:37.670
is to deny them a major opportunity for self-knowledge and enlightenment, which is just the light of knowing who you are.

26:39.353 --> 26:44.582
So it's not this dirty, furtive thing that has been pushed into the corner at all.

26:44.622 --> 26:46.586
It's not this thing that has been demonized.

26:47.768 --> 26:49.811
Instead, it is a major light.

26:50.392 --> 26:52.035
Sexuality is a major light.

26:53.467 --> 26:56.611
And that's why, you know, the church has been so hard on it.

26:56.752 --> 26:59.015
I mean, the earlier, the church didn't even want marriage.

26:59.215 --> 27:06.005
They didn't even, I don't know how far you studied it back there, but they were so against sex that they thought if you got married, it was bad.

27:06.485 --> 27:13.595
You know, but then they figured out a way to control marriage and to be the official, you know, guardians of it.

27:13.836 --> 27:17.561
And then, of course, okay, it didn't be okay if you married in our church.

27:19.343 --> 27:21.887
But they, you know, they knew that it was

27:22.373 --> 27:26.538
You know, it was a very big spiritual thing.

27:26.558 --> 27:28.881
One other quick question that I had on with.

27:28.901 --> 27:29.862
They told me half an hour.

27:32.065 --> 27:36.010
The characters, you say, evolve from a state of grace, as a quote.

27:36.330 --> 27:36.691
Yes.

27:36.891 --> 27:40.416
As opposed to actually developing characters as characters.

27:41.096 --> 27:49.647
Well, it's like, yeah, I mean, that seems to imply that the work of it is somehow not acknowledged.

27:49.846 --> 27:50.928
That's not what I mean at all.

27:51.008 --> 27:52.050
I work really hard.

27:52.070 --> 27:54.153
I mean, I develop as much as anybody else.

27:54.233 --> 28:04.571
But the work after a while is so intense, and it's done in such solitude in my case, that eventually they just start talking.

28:06.594 --> 28:09.259
And so that's why it feels like grace.

28:09.379 --> 28:10.200
And you hear their voices.

28:10.441 --> 28:12.985
Well, yeah, they just, you know, they just, you know.

28:13.285 --> 28:14.988
Why don't you do that now?

28:15.048 --> 28:24.582
Do they have, and this is almost a cliche question, because you do talk, novelists do contend that their characters do assert themselves and determine where they're going.

28:24.802 --> 28:27.987
Well, see, that's how you know that you have a live one.

28:29.009 --> 28:31.873
If they don't do that, you know, I think you should just forget about them.

28:32.514 --> 28:34.136
Put them away for five years.

28:34.637 --> 28:36.380
So are you surprised then by where they go?

28:37.061 --> 28:37.742
Do they surprise you?

28:37.842 --> 28:38.202
Oh, yeah.

28:39.324 --> 28:39.985
Oh, they do.

28:40.471 --> 28:41.633
And that's the other part of it.

28:41.673 --> 28:42.975
That's why it's worth writing.

28:43.335 --> 28:45.358
Yeah, because they're not going to surprise me.

28:45.378 --> 28:46.560
Why would they surprise you?

28:47.141 --> 28:47.401
That's right.

28:47.421 --> 28:47.622
Exactly.

28:47.642 --> 28:53.370
You know, Manuelito is not hit by the bus, you know, and if I don't go, oh, no, why would you go, oh, no?

28:53.410 --> 28:53.871
That's great.

28:54.011 --> 28:56.455
I should point out that my background is Greek, by the way.

28:56.535 --> 28:56.956
Really?

28:56.976 --> 28:58.618
I'm going to Greece next week.

28:58.638 --> 28:59.039
Oh, fabulous.

28:59.059 --> 29:00.260
And then to Turkey and Egypt.

29:00.280 --> 29:02.744
I'm working on an article for Smithsonian.

29:02.764 --> 29:04.707
It's getting some stuff from my book, so...

29:05.058 --> 29:08.783
I really enjoyed the Greek references.

29:08.803 --> 29:11.126
So a week from today, I'll be in Turkey as well.

29:11.146 --> 29:11.586
Amazing.

29:12.488 --> 29:13.329
I've never been to Turkey.

29:13.369 --> 29:18.455
Actually, I've been to emphasis, but I'm going to the great libraries through history, and then I'm going to go to St.

29:18.475 --> 29:20.258
Catherine's Monastery in Sinai.

29:20.898 --> 29:21.820
We're under one roof.

29:21.840 --> 29:25.044
You have a church, a mosque, and a synagogue.

29:25.785 --> 29:27.087
The only place on earth.

29:27.347 --> 29:27.427
St.

29:27.507 --> 29:28.288
Catherine's, huh?

29:28.308 --> 29:28.368
St.

29:28.388 --> 29:28.949
Catherine's.

29:28.969 --> 29:31.352
And there's a library there that's 1,500 years old.

29:32.092 --> 29:34.936
There are actually books there that have been there.

29:34.956 --> 29:35.617
It's in Egypt.

29:36.077 --> 29:37.098
It's down in Sinai.

29:37.219 --> 29:40.222
It's down in the Sinai, tip of the Sharm el-Sheikh I'm flying.

29:41.865 --> 29:46.170
And then I'm going to have to spend five days with the monks on Mount Athos.

29:46.190 --> 29:47.952
And I'm writing about that for Smithsonian.

29:47.972 --> 29:49.955
So I'm going to have fun.

29:50.215 --> 29:53.560
Would you kindly inscribe my book?

29:53.580 --> 29:54.741
If you don't mind, I'll take it.
