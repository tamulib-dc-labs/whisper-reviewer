WEBVTT

00:02.917 --> 00:05.220
We're talking to Tony or Anthony Bliss?

00:05.260 --> 00:05.981
What do you prefer?

00:06.762 --> 00:07.423
Oh, Tony.

00:07.583 --> 00:08.804
Tony, and to Ted.

00:09.265 --> 00:17.015
Just for the sake of the tape recorder here, why don't you just tell us what your position is here at the Bancrofton?

00:17.035 --> 00:24.784
Well, the title is Curator of Rare Books and Literary Manuskirts at Bancrofton.

00:25.185 --> 00:27.628
And you're a third generation?

00:27.728 --> 00:29.130
There's a gene pool.

00:29.830 --> 00:30.291
Wow.

00:30.929 --> 00:35.233
So we're looking at a photograph of... Grandpa.

00:35.253 --> 00:35.674
Wesley.

00:35.914 --> 00:36.174
Yes.

00:36.795 --> 00:39.678
He started working for Henry Huntington in 1915.

00:39.698 --> 00:42.100
And I have him in General Madness, by the way.

00:42.120 --> 00:42.220
Yeah.

00:42.340 --> 00:42.961
And your dad?

00:44.482 --> 00:45.844
Started working at Huntington.

00:45.924 --> 00:46.685
And his full name?

00:46.705 --> 00:47.085
Cary.

00:48.386 --> 00:48.727
C-A-R-E-Y.

00:48.747 --> 00:49.047
Okay.

00:49.407 --> 00:49.948
There he is.

00:51.429 --> 00:54.512
He started working at Huntington's house.

00:54.573 --> 00:55.213
He was 36.

00:55.994 --> 00:57.235
Wow.

00:57.255 --> 00:59.097
Did he also work at Huntington?

01:00.410 --> 01:10.905
At this time, my grandfather, I guess, this is August of 66, my grandfather had just retired as librarian.

01:13.108 --> 01:20.919
Dad was curator of her books, and I was working at a page, as a page, in the rear book stacks.

01:20.939 --> 01:25.806
So, all three of us were on staff at Huntington at one time.

01:25.826 --> 01:28.510
This is, you know, so you're a third-generation

01:29.924 --> 01:33.670
I'm sure it's happened elsewhere, but I don't know.

01:33.690 --> 01:39.961
It's fairly unusual, you know, whether it's some sort of genetic defect or— Let's bring this closer.

01:40.883 --> 01:45.390
Some sort of genetic defect or what, I think.

01:45.410 --> 01:47.113
But what does it betray?

01:47.193 --> 01:49.657
How does that—what books is it?

01:49.677 --> 01:52.723
Is it in age or what?

01:52.803 --> 01:53.163
I don't know.

01:53.524 --> 01:55.948
Do we have heredity or—

01:56.823 --> 02:00.368
What are the terms of the dichotomy, heredity, or environment?

02:01.730 --> 02:02.691
It's a little of both, I suppose.

02:02.751 --> 02:04.373
Awfully.

02:04.834 --> 02:09.099
Environment, I suppose, is probably a major factor.

02:09.119 --> 02:10.321
I was always surrounded by books.

02:10.341 --> 02:26.222
Books were always crowding us out around the house, and as a kid, I'd ask Dad a question, and he'd say, well, you could find it in here, and he'd hand it to me, and that would be it.

02:26.658 --> 02:48.092
The sort of people who came through the house when I was a kid would be scholars working in Huntington, and I would hear most amazing discussions going on about bibliography and various historical and literary topics, much of which I couldn't follow.

02:48.376 --> 02:51.160
There's some sort of osmosis factor, perhaps, that went there.

02:51.300 --> 02:53.403
Yeah, but they could have bored you, too.

02:53.423 --> 03:09.304
Yeah, but I mean, there was a time when Howard Nixon, who then was keeper of printed books at the British Library, was at Huntington, and he came down to the house for dinner, and we talked about baseball the whole evening.

03:10.853 --> 03:12.916
I said, that's interesting.

03:13.157 --> 03:14.979
Who would have thought they knew a publicist?

03:15.340 --> 03:17.663
Well, he was trying to find out what in hell we were doing.

03:17.703 --> 03:20.989
How old are you?

03:21.149 --> 03:24.073
Fifty-one.

03:24.173 --> 03:24.694
Fifty-one.

03:28.260 --> 03:37.013
So when you added up, I started, I still remember my first day as a summer job, as a page at Huntington.

03:38.360 --> 03:43.708
which, you know, it was just the path of least resistance in terms of finding a job for the summer.

03:43.728 --> 03:44.909
The pay was absolutely horrible.

03:44.930 --> 03:49.516
I think it was a dollar and a quarter an hour, and that would have been 64.

03:57.908 --> 03:59.010
What was the point?

03:59.050 --> 04:03.917
Well, I guess we'll try to—is this something you always assume that you'd be doing, I guess?

04:04.057 --> 04:04.678
No, no.

04:04.758 --> 04:07.422
As a matter of fact, I never gave it a thought.

04:07.722 --> 04:10.565
I guess that means I had thirty-five years in the business.

04:10.585 --> 04:12.446
That's what it means, yeah.

04:12.466 --> 04:13.107
That is absolutely amazing.

04:13.127 --> 04:16.470
Yeah, to do the math.

04:18.051 --> 04:24.898
And not always in libraries.

04:25.238 --> 04:27.000
I had one stint as a bookseller.

04:28.021 --> 04:28.221
Where?

04:28.261 --> 04:30.142
Two stints as a matter of fact, one in Paris.

04:31.243 --> 04:33.546
I was a French major in college.

04:33.566 --> 04:35.147
And where was that, in Williamson?

04:36.933 --> 05:01.163
Yeah, and then I went back and worked a little while longer at Huntington, and once the draft was in the middle of the Vietnam War, of course, once the draft situation got settled, I was free to get on with my life.

05:01.544 --> 05:04.187
This is one of those cases they say, worrying never solves anything.

05:04.247 --> 05:06.670
Well, I worried about it so much I gave myself an Aussie.

05:07.004 --> 05:07.905
That solved the problem.

05:07.945 --> 05:08.506
Really?

05:08.546 --> 05:09.447
Well, I was 4F.

05:11.550 --> 05:14.114
I wasn't so lucky.

05:14.134 --> 05:16.918
Well, I still have the remains of that offset.

05:16.938 --> 05:18.039
You still have the offset, yeah.

05:18.600 --> 05:19.862
I was a little bit older than you.

05:19.882 --> 05:23.587
I went through in the 60s, 70s, 60s.

05:23.627 --> 05:24.048
They got in?

05:24.588 --> 05:25.329
Yeah, I suppose.

05:25.350 --> 05:28.193
I was on an aircraft carrier, public affairs officer.

05:28.213 --> 05:28.474
Oh, yeah.

05:28.494 --> 05:30.076
I did two VNLs.

05:31.418 --> 05:34.222
Anyway, that's history.

05:34.242 --> 05:34.362
Right.

05:34.915 --> 06:03.015
I got a master's at UCLA in France and had pretty much worked myself out of a job and I had to come up with something else and I decided well I'd done my junior year in France and I thought it was the most wonderful thing in the world so I liquidated my assets which meant I sold my Volkswagen and

06:03.890 --> 06:08.878
bought a one-way charter ticket to London.

06:08.898 --> 06:10.220
That was the cheapest destination.

06:10.300 --> 06:12.884
And then got myself to Paris from there.

06:13.004 --> 06:16.529
And I arrived with a suitcase and a typewriter.

06:17.090 --> 06:24.962
I figured if I couldn't find a job, I'd go to Greece or Spain someplace cheap and write the great American novel.

06:24.982 --> 06:25.603
And I was lucky.

06:25.683 --> 06:32.614
I managed to find myself a job with an old-time bookstore by the name of Marcel Blanchetot.

06:32.982 --> 06:37.989
B-L-A-N-C-H-E-T-B-A-U.

06:40.213 --> 06:44.679
He had a shop pretty close to the Eiffel Tower.

06:48.365 --> 06:57.658
By that time he was doing less antiquarian work and more new book jobbing to American libraries.

06:57.678 --> 07:00.422
American, Canadian, British libraries.

07:00.443 --> 07:02.145
And he wanted somebody who was bilingual too.

07:02.834 --> 07:06.078
handle correspondence, this, that, and the other thing.

07:07.159 --> 07:29.347
And so I wound up working with him for over two years, largely on the new book side, but when he came up with good antiquarian stuff, he would ask me to describe it and catalog it.

07:29.367 --> 07:31.069
So you were becoming a bibliographer.

07:31.268 --> 07:35.955
Well, I would agree, you know, and then some ideas on, well, who's going to be a customer for this?

07:36.275 --> 07:40.421
And I helped him place a couple of fairly important books that way.

07:41.883 --> 07:44.426
And I traveled books for him one year.

07:45.247 --> 07:47.811
He said, well, I want you to do the rounds.

07:48.272 --> 07:54.220
And I said, I was in, what, 25 states and five Canadian provinces in a period of six weeks.

07:54.841 --> 08:00.769
And I wouldn't want to do that again.

08:02.082 --> 08:11.815
It was amusing, sort of, once, but it got me into a lot of libraries that way, of course.

08:13.197 --> 08:16.642
You mentioned outside that Pierre offered you a job, is that right?

08:16.662 --> 08:31.482
Oh, yeah, when I first got there, this would have been March or April of 71, I had put an ad in a French trade publication, Bibliographie de la France,

08:34.128 --> 08:42.017
And to my great surprise, I actually got an answer from none other than Pierre Barrest.

08:42.297 --> 08:42.958
I couldn't believe it.

08:43.058 --> 08:50.005
And so when I got to Paris, she said, when you get to town, do look me up.

08:50.065 --> 08:50.766
So I did so.

08:52.308 --> 09:03.460
And we had a brief chat on the phone, and they said, well, the shop is being on the Avenue Friedland is being remodeled, so would you

09:04.182 --> 09:08.567
mind coming to my home, which is on the Avenue Fush.

09:09.629 --> 09:11.211
Is that where you met him?

09:11.671 --> 09:14.114
So he took us to dinner.

09:14.174 --> 09:15.836
I went in there.

09:16.237 --> 09:18.219
I couldn't figure out which door to go in.

09:19.280 --> 09:25.508
I finally picked the biggest one and brazenly knocked.

09:25.528 --> 09:31.455
And we walked in and we sat in the little breakfast nook, which has only the small Cezanne's on the wall.

09:32.718 --> 09:37.264
And he asked me if I liked whiskey, and did I mind having whiskey before lunch?

09:37.284 --> 09:39.226
And I thought I might as well.

09:39.246 --> 09:40.828
I had nothing to lose.

09:41.609 --> 09:55.265
And we talked about things, and he was interested in strategies I might have for putting together whole collections and selling them en bloc as research collections to university libraries.

09:55.285 --> 10:01.493
And I had to admit that I hadn't given that much thought, but I could see that there was merit to it.

10:01.810 --> 10:05.274
at the end of the year on American universities, I was never rolling in dough.

10:06.916 --> 10:10.981
And a lot of money was being spent stupidly, but there was certainly a lot of money out there.

10:12.623 --> 10:15.447
And we talked about that for a bit.

10:15.487 --> 10:25.759
And then he said, well, I see some possibilities here, and I'd be willing to offer you 900 francs a month, starting next September.

10:29.553 --> 10:31.275
What was I supposed to do in the meantime?

10:31.615 --> 10:35.000
And you could die on 900, 100 frames a month with no problem at all.

10:36.101 --> 10:38.203
So thank you for the whiskey.

10:38.223 --> 10:40.186
Yeah, thank you.

10:40.286 --> 10:46.593
And I love the Cezanne, but I'm afraid this is not, this probably won't work for me.

10:46.653 --> 10:54.783
I wound up at a couple of other shops in one auction house trying to see whether there was some possibilities for me.

10:54.823 --> 10:58.007
And then I wound up with Mr. Blanc still.

10:58.493 --> 11:01.036
And then, how did you get into the same old show?

11:01.697 --> 11:09.165
Well, then I met my future wife there when I walked into Blancsteau's that first day.

11:09.185 --> 11:10.267
Oh, yeah, right there.

11:10.287 --> 11:10.907
Freshman?

11:11.288 --> 11:12.089
Yeah.

11:12.109 --> 11:18.556
His secretary, seated behind him, were actually on the other side of the room, and it was very touching.

11:18.656 --> 11:21.760
I mean, she looked up and said, Christ, another American.

11:22.801 --> 11:23.442
She said that?

11:23.462 --> 11:23.742
Yeah.

11:24.194 --> 11:25.556
In French.

11:25.676 --> 11:27.799
As soon as you couldn't understand her.

11:27.819 --> 11:30.823
Yeah, she had a long couple of days, yeah.

11:31.084 --> 11:32.205
She took two weeks.

11:32.225 --> 11:33.467
And so it was fake.

11:33.487 --> 11:35.610
She said, what could she do?

11:35.630 --> 11:37.473
That's great.

11:37.493 --> 11:39.495
But she was... This was in 1971.

11:39.515 --> 11:40.577
This was in 1971.

11:40.597 --> 11:42.399
Twenty-six years ago.

11:43.100 --> 11:47.667
Are there any fourth-generation Bliss librarians in the works?

11:47.727 --> 11:51.372
Well, there are two other Blisses out there.

11:51.392 --> 11:52.834
They're both in college now.

11:53.438 --> 11:54.520
Male, female?

11:54.920 --> 11:55.441
No, no.

11:55.461 --> 12:10.905
We have Edward, who is a senior at Colgate, and Adrian is a sophomore at Hamilton, and Edward works four hours a week in science, by the way.

12:11.406 --> 12:14.330
Actually, we love the Eastern Liberal Arts School.

12:14.350 --> 12:15.872
Well, they wanted to do what Daddy did.

12:16.053 --> 12:17.415
Oh, yeah.

12:17.815 --> 12:20.880
Yeah.

12:21.451 --> 12:22.853
which is why I guess we love books.

12:23.093 --> 12:24.775
Same thing, yeah, right, yeah.

12:24.795 --> 12:27.078
Living a liberalized education is how you do that.

12:27.558 --> 12:45.199
Well, when I was at Williams, I worked in the Chapin Library for Archer, and, you know, this is mafia for a book librarian, and I think it was a much closer in it group back in those days than it is now.

12:45.219 --> 12:48.623
There are more of us now.

12:48.923 --> 12:50.846
than there used to be.

12:50.866 --> 13:01.922
But when we were talking about what college you want to go to, my dad sort of talked to people, Archers of Williams, and so-and-so, and so-and-so, and so-and-so, and so-and-so.

13:01.942 --> 13:08.131
And the other thing, I didn't know if I could get into any of these places, but that was kind of the way we went through the list.

13:08.191 --> 13:10.434
Well, yes, it was pretty amazing.

13:11.035 --> 13:12.156
Do you have any anxiety?

13:12.477 --> 13:16.703
I mean, I've talked to Peter and I've talked to Charles and...

13:17.138 --> 13:28.870
You know, we all know what's happening with money for books and for computer systems, and how much money is being spent on special collections, which is next, you know.

13:30.732 --> 13:39.921
Coming from the kind of book tradition that you're doing, generational as well as your own extensive background of thirty million-odd years, what do you feel?

13:39.941 --> 13:42.404
I mean, softball down the middle of the plate.

13:43.265 --> 13:44.446
Books aren't going away.

13:44.466 --> 13:46.588
They are, they are not.

13:47.193 --> 13:59.651
And what bothers me a lot is that the digitized library, the electronic library, is really so much oversold.

14:00.392 --> 14:14.053
It's a real annoyance to be in a horse and buggy era of digital libraries and that sort of thing, because the expectations are sky high, and the reality is just barely off the ground.

14:15.395 --> 14:16.997
But that's where they're going with the money.

14:18.108 --> 14:25.014
It is, until there's going to be a reality check.

14:25.915 --> 14:37.805
And here at Berkeley, I think we're starting to see it set in, where the faculty realize that, yeah, we're going to have to go ahead with that and the other thing.

14:37.825 --> 14:38.986
But that's an add-on.

14:39.006 --> 14:41.248
That's not an instead-of cost.

14:42.069 --> 14:46.133
Well, as Peter said, there's no allowance for inflation here.

14:46.253 --> 14:47.794
You have the same budget every year.

14:47.993 --> 14:53.159
Since 1989, that's eight years.

14:53.980 --> 14:56.383
This particular institution is falling behind.

14:56.403 --> 15:07.537
There have been, in the history of the Berkeley libraries, there have been other times when floods got tight and things had to be stopped.

15:08.919 --> 15:12.263
That creates gaps in the collection, particularly in things like periodical.

15:13.002 --> 15:14.683
Well, we discussed that in life.

15:14.884 --> 15:19.307
Yeah, because even ordinary type things.

15:19.368 --> 15:26.073
Because here you get up to 1971, and boom, there's a five-year gap.

15:26.093 --> 15:28.035
And then it picks up in 76 and carries on.

15:28.876 --> 15:31.218
What the hell's going on here?

15:31.498 --> 15:35.602
You can explain to the faculty member or the student that, oh yeah, we ran out of money for those five years.

15:36.783 --> 15:42.908
That's kind of a service to staff, particularly if you're a major institution like this, which I think should be a library of record.

15:43.951 --> 15:47.558
and can't be at that point.

15:48.139 --> 15:51.625
I'm going to fall away from that.

15:51.805 --> 15:56.995
Is it a possibility that you may no longer be perceived as a library of records?

15:57.215 --> 16:00.922
If this time continues long enough, yeah.

16:00.942 --> 16:02.826
I mean, we could live on our laurels for a long time.

16:02.886 --> 16:04.529
You've got great stuff.

16:04.549 --> 16:06.232
Are you still acquiring special collections?

16:06.252 --> 16:07.214
Absolutely.

16:07.354 --> 16:08.035
In what areas?

16:08.639 --> 16:12.745
Are you doing stuff to satisfy the needs of scholars now?

16:12.765 --> 16:14.628
Are you looking ahead twenty or thirty years?

16:14.648 --> 16:17.933
I'm laying track in front of the scholarly locomotive as fast as I can.

16:18.874 --> 16:20.616
And there's a lot of stuff out there.

16:20.636 --> 16:23.841
Here's the collection policy, the last draft, we're working on a new one.

16:24.522 --> 16:26.245
Is that something I can get at some point?

16:26.325 --> 16:28.548
I could give you one.

16:28.848 --> 16:34.056
Because this is, you know, just looking at the table of contents, you see the kind of

16:35.015 --> 16:44.228
stuff that's out there that we're working on in terms of... Yeah, I'd love to get a copy of this.

16:44.809 --> 16:49.436
The whole thing is... Let me get you the revised... Okay, it's just coming up.

16:49.456 --> 16:55.765
I just... You know, this book is... This book will be published in 1999, by the way.

16:56.105 --> 16:57.747
Good, because I haven't finished that.

16:57.767 --> 16:58.809
So it's time.

16:59.510 --> 17:01.553
But that's called the... What is that called?

17:01.573 --> 17:03.115
Just the Bancroft Collection Policy.

17:05.407 --> 17:18.787
And we're doing it now, and we're doing it with the advice and counsel of interested faculty.

17:19.868 --> 17:22.853
And we're trying to interest more and more faculty all the time, of course.

17:23.794 --> 17:33.388
And we're being successful at that, because we're finding more and more people coming in.

17:34.516 --> 17:46.294
For various things, and this is the time of year I get booked to talk to classes about this, that, and the other thing.

17:46.314 --> 17:48.798
And this afternoon I have to talk about Rousseau for three hours.

17:49.679 --> 17:52.644
I don't have to like Rousseau.

17:52.684 --> 18:02.599
And sure, I can't talk about him for three hours, but I feel that the students ought to see the text they're reading in their original form.

18:03.541 --> 18:10.871
Then I will try and point out to them the impact of the original technology on the presentation and the actual content of the text.

18:12.393 --> 18:22.587
You know, what does it mean to have to set the type by hand, lay it out, get the pages in the right order, make mistakes, stop the press, change things.

18:25.551 --> 18:27.934
What is the impact of the technology on the text that you're reading?

18:29.617 --> 18:31.700
And there is an impact.

18:31.720 --> 18:32.721
It does make a difference.

18:33.545 --> 18:38.511
And there are mistakes introduced, can be introduced at any number of places along the line.

18:38.531 --> 18:42.416
And to detect that, you have to know what the technology is.

18:42.516 --> 18:45.520
You have two sons and father.

18:45.600 --> 18:46.181
Son and a daughter.

18:46.381 --> 18:46.902
Some sons.

18:47.002 --> 18:47.663
Adrienne.

18:47.683 --> 18:49.785
Adrienne, double N-E.

18:49.945 --> 18:50.506
A-d-r-i.

18:51.648 --> 18:52.889
I-e-n-n-e.

18:52.909 --> 18:53.089
Okay.

18:53.109 --> 18:53.790
And she is?

18:54.511 --> 18:56.714
She's a sophomore at Hamilton.

18:56.734 --> 18:58.075
She's at Hamilton.

18:58.196 --> 19:00.058
And the son is at Colgate.

19:00.078 --> 19:00.919
Colgate, yeah.

19:01.237 --> 19:15.014
I think my wife would kill him.

19:15.034 --> 19:15.274
Why?

19:16.536 --> 19:20.661
Oh, um... She'd rebel, certainly.

19:20.681 --> 19:20.781
Yeah.

19:20.801 --> 19:22.743
She'd be near, at least.

19:22.783 --> 19:30.973
She wouldn't, uh... I think she's maybe a little more ambitious.

19:31.882 --> 19:34.705
She herself actually has a library degree.

19:35.826 --> 19:40.631
From the Astutie Catholique in Paris as a, they call it a documentary.

19:40.651 --> 19:42.653
And what's your wife's name?

19:42.673 --> 19:43.914
Marie-Noel.

19:44.595 --> 19:45.796
M-A-R-I-E.

19:45.816 --> 19:45.996
Yeah.

19:46.937 --> 19:47.277
Dash.

19:47.758 --> 19:50.040
N-O-E-L-N-E.

19:51.221 --> 19:55.626
With a diuresis over the E. Thirsty and Noel.

19:58.468 --> 19:59.109
Two dots.

19:59.429 --> 20:00.150
Two dots.

20:01.919 --> 20:04.223
That's how you pronounce the O and the E separately.

20:05.305 --> 20:06.227
That's right.

20:06.247 --> 20:08.811
That's what it means to me.

20:08.831 --> 20:09.011
Go ahead.

20:10.474 --> 20:15.342
But, no, she said, oh, no, she wants to do something else.

20:15.363 --> 20:17.386
There's enough of this librarian and stuff.

20:17.406 --> 20:20.151
But do you think it's a group industry?

20:20.752 --> 20:21.694
Librarianship?

20:21.794 --> 20:24.058
No.

20:24.819 --> 20:27.083
It's becoming much more technical.

20:27.974 --> 20:46.532
But we are starting to see a problem, and that is that there is nonetheless a certain demand out there for the people who know something about books.

20:46.552 --> 20:55.500
And it's very hard to, in this day and age, find a library school at all

20:55.970 --> 21:07.843
And worse, one that has any kind of program in the history in books and printing, or certification in rare book librarianship.

21:07.863 --> 21:11.667
There are summer programs out there, like the University of Virginia.

21:11.967 --> 21:12.828
Cherries, yeah.

21:12.848 --> 21:13.629
Cherries.

21:13.909 --> 21:16.152
I'm speaking there actually.

21:17.173 --> 21:19.916
But it's not a rigorous program.

21:19.936 --> 21:24.120
When I went through UCLA Library School, which was after my stint in France,

21:24.758 --> 21:28.343
I decided that I was going to have to do something so that I could actually earn a living.

21:28.884 --> 21:30.206
So you got a degree from UCLA?

21:30.887 --> 21:31.428
Yeah.

21:31.648 --> 21:42.143
I had my Master's in French, and then I went back and did the Master's in Library Science with what they called in those days a specialization in rare books and manuscripts.

21:42.203 --> 21:42.864
So you are a librarian.

21:42.884 --> 21:47.952
You are, in fact, a trained librarian.

21:47.972 --> 21:48.312
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:49.894 --> 21:53.820
Well, my grandfather went to library school with Melville Dewey.

21:54.475 --> 21:56.497
At Columbia.

21:57.018 --> 21:57.538
No, at Albany.

22:00.101 --> 22:07.929
And then my father didn't get a library degree, and then I did.

22:09.771 --> 22:21.883
But it was made clear to me that the way the profession worked in those days, I wouldn't get any kind of job unless I had the library degree, which wasn't enormously relevant to rare book librarianship.

22:22.049 --> 22:28.276
The usual curriculum, but the specialized courses, certainly one.

22:28.396 --> 22:31.639
This university, this here, no longer has a library school.

22:32.400 --> 22:37.506
Well, we have something in that building, but it's the School of Information Management and Systems.

22:38.106 --> 22:39.648
Are there any courses in bibliography?

22:39.688 --> 22:39.848
No.

22:41.990 --> 22:51.921
And they used to have a typographical lab in the basement for students to work with and actually set type and print and then make paper.

22:52.255 --> 22:54.978
I've recovered most of that and brought it over here to Bancroft.

22:55.038 --> 22:55.779
We already had it.

22:57.841 --> 22:59.123
How did you feel when that happened?

22:59.943 --> 23:00.604
Very sad.

23:01.765 --> 23:06.531
And the dean over there, Hal Varian, likes books.

23:06.551 --> 23:08.613
He's a little bit of a book collector himself.

23:09.094 --> 23:09.614
What's his name?

23:09.834 --> 23:11.977
Hal Varian, V-A-R-I-A-N.

23:14.119 --> 23:15.380
Varian and Associates.

23:15.521 --> 23:20.566
Well, it wasn't his decision, I'm sure.

23:20.586 --> 23:22.228
You know, I mean, this is what he came in

23:22.850 --> 23:48.465
This is what he was brought in to do, was to work on programming, information management, and not paper-based materials at all.

23:48.906 --> 23:52.030
Well, that's making a statement for university, isn't it?

23:52.297 --> 24:04.976
And whether or not there is room for a professional school to do only that on a campus that also is a powerhouse in computer studies.

24:06.838 --> 24:08.020
As this university is.

24:08.040 --> 24:08.821
As Berkeley is.

24:09.703 --> 24:10.063
I don't know.

24:10.183 --> 24:15.972
I don't know if he's going to be able to stake out that territory and defend it and have a viable school.

24:18.075 --> 24:19.617
We'll see.

24:19.637 --> 24:20.599
I don't know.

24:20.639 --> 24:21.460
When did this happen?

24:21.710 --> 24:25.875
Oh, gosh, this was three years ago, I think.

24:25.895 --> 24:27.857
Of course, Columbia's program is history, too.

24:27.978 --> 24:28.638
It's gone.

24:29.980 --> 24:33.725
Texas is still out there, and so it's— And Wisconsin is supposed to be history.

24:33.945 --> 24:35.126
Wisconsin and Michigan.

24:37.069 --> 24:39.692
I think Oregon is still going.

24:40.553 --> 24:46.780
But the only library degree you can get in the state of California is at San Jose State.

24:46.800 --> 24:48.122
Okay, that one is down there.

24:49.857 --> 24:50.658
Did you know that?

24:50.678 --> 24:51.138
Is he?

24:51.158 --> 24:53.281
Yeah, he's teaching two courses.

24:53.301 --> 24:54.783
I'm seeing him tonight, by the way.

24:54.943 --> 24:55.563
Thank you.

24:57.225 --> 25:02.011
The last one, I'm sure if I try to get the architects to go home.

25:02.031 --> 25:03.072
And then we'll home.

25:03.172 --> 25:03.933
Yeah.

25:03.953 --> 25:05.895
What's your time constraint, by the way?

25:06.075 --> 25:09.159
I have to go talk about Rousseau at about 3.

25:09.759 --> 25:11.541
So I could go for a bit home.

25:11.561 --> 25:12.122
Okay.

25:12.342 --> 25:14.685
Now that we've met, I can call you, which is good.

25:14.985 --> 25:17.468
But go ahead, just so I know what we've got for time.

25:18.545 --> 25:20.066
I've forgotten where I was.

25:20.427 --> 25:25.331
Well, we're talking about the school, and the disappearance thereof, and the statement.

25:25.391 --> 25:41.205
You know, what worries me about that is that we're going to be producing generations of scholars coming to the history department, and the English department, and the various language departments, where they're working with all their texts.

25:43.407 --> 25:47.370
And they're not going to have the bibliographical awareness that they need.

25:47.637 --> 25:58.266
You know, can I set a Marie Antoinette letter in front of this class and say, is there anything fishy about this?

25:58.406 --> 26:05.092
And it's written in ballpoint pen on wood pulp paper, and would anybody notice?

26:05.532 --> 26:08.755
Would you just jump out at them?

26:10.756 --> 26:11.557
Somebody might notice.

26:12.598 --> 26:17.442
But I worry that a lot of them wouldn't.

26:17.810 --> 26:28.244
If you're working with documents and you're working with older material, you have to have some equipment to deal, to understand what it is you're looking at.

26:28.284 --> 26:30.728
There's a lot of fakes and frauds out there.

26:33.712 --> 26:37.397
That's just one example of the sort of application that I wish they had.

26:38.358 --> 26:47.631
There seems to be a little trend growing, and I noticed this has happened in Iowa, putting together interdisciplinary programs

26:47.864 --> 26:54.293
on history of the book and bibliography.

26:54.353 --> 26:57.397
And there are a lot of topics that could be folded into that.

26:57.997 --> 27:07.831
And I'm very interested, we've got some people interested in doing this sort of thing here on the Berkeley Tandos, and I hope it turns out to be possible.

27:09.132 --> 27:11.135
And I would love to participate in that.

27:12.377 --> 27:17.263
Though around here librarians, well you can teach, but the library can't offer courses.

27:17.648 --> 27:25.295
But librarians can, can be brought in as Edja.

27:26.596 --> 27:31.041
Could you give me some specifics about the kind of special collections you are acquiring?

27:31.161 --> 27:46.255
Well, for example, we're getting a lot of play just now on a purchase I made last fiscal year of sixty titles of the Bibliotec Bleu.

27:47.382 --> 27:51.608
which is popular literature mostly 18th century.

27:51.668 --> 27:55.153
The ones I managed to get were all 18th century.

27:55.253 --> 27:56.575
B-L-E-U-E?

27:57.416 --> 27:57.816
B-L-E-U-E.

27:58.637 --> 28:04.465
There's a writer actually in it, of it, in the latest Bank of Indiana.

28:04.485 --> 28:05.266
I wrote an article on it.

28:06.007 --> 28:07.169
Do you have one here?

28:07.189 --> 28:09.452
No, I need one.

28:10.694 --> 28:11.275
Let me do that.

28:11.475 --> 28:16.782
Let me do that.

28:23.478 --> 28:25.761
Oh, that's great.

28:27.283 --> 28:30.367
And this is a terrifically interesting match of stuff.

28:30.687 --> 28:35.414
What it is, is popular literature.

28:35.554 --> 28:41.802
A lot of the stuff that was published in it are medieval survivals.

28:43.204 --> 28:46.669
So that you have, for example, I'm going to be showing it this afternoon.

28:46.729 --> 28:51.595
You've got the Encyclopédie, and you've got Diderot, and the Philosophe,

28:51.946 --> 28:58.413
Rousseau out there, and they're all powdered within an inch of their lives, and incredibly refined and wonderfully intelligent.

28:59.174 --> 29:06.923
And these are the talk of all of the salons, and these are the worry of the king and whatnot.

29:07.484 --> 29:10.007
And what's the guy in the street reading?

29:10.848 --> 29:19.658
He's reading about Romances of Chivalry, and The Dance of Death, and all these medieval survivals.

29:21.325 --> 29:26.311
And what's also pretty interesting is that it's not California history?

29:26.371 --> 29:26.532
No.

29:26.912 --> 29:28.634
No, it's in Bancroft.

29:28.714 --> 29:46.778
Yeah, I know, but it does indicate that you are continuing to be— Well, Bancroft's a little schizo, because obviously the Bancroft Library, per se, goes back to Hubert Howe, Bancroft, Western Americana, and Mexico, and that's the reputation.

29:46.838 --> 29:50.202
But back in—what was it?

29:50.873 --> 30:06.216
when Jim Hart became directed, he negotiated the merger of the Berkeley's Fair Book Department with Bancroft.

30:06.236 --> 30:14.368
And it was sort of an orphan department that was put together grudgingly in 1954.

30:16.171 --> 30:18.054
It just wasn't the Berkeley way.

30:18.514 --> 30:19.716
Books circulated and that was it.

30:20.827 --> 30:25.311
So I got interconnected with book pockets in them.

30:25.391 --> 30:25.731
Wow.

30:26.292 --> 30:29.835
I've never pressed that before.

30:33.678 --> 30:39.803
Berkeley just didn't like that sort of approach, and so resisted for years.

30:40.424 --> 30:50.412
Even though the material was actually here, that almost any institution would have put in a

30:51.100 --> 31:00.714
a rare book collection, or a treasure room, or some such thing, which is a beastly thing to do, a treasure room.

31:00.734 --> 31:01.675
Berkeley didn't want to do that.

31:03.958 --> 31:05.300
But finally, there was just too much.

31:06.522 --> 31:08.745
It had to be dealt with more of a response.

31:08.805 --> 31:14.253
And so, it wasn't until 54 that they actually had set up their department and put somebody in charge of it.

31:14.594 --> 31:17.698
They didn't fund much of anything else.

31:18.185 --> 31:24.212
And so it became a repository when stuff was given, and it was quite a passive operation.

31:25.554 --> 31:30.760
So it made sense to merge it with Bancroft, because there were a few overlaps.

31:31.501 --> 31:36.588
You know, the rare book collection had great collections of Western writers, people like Frank Norris, for example.

31:37.349 --> 31:44.277
I don't have dovetails, but Bancroft, in many respects, named Rose Bierce.

31:45.337 --> 31:49.661
In the old time, Bancroft just thought this, of course, was heresy.

31:50.482 --> 31:56.167
It was going to delete the mission of the Bancroft Library.

31:56.187 --> 32:07.258
But I think the results that we've seen over the years, you know, largely I suppose because of Jim Hart's driving personality, was that it was a success for both.

32:08.419 --> 32:14.365
Because when we, back in 70, there was one endowment for acquisition.

32:15.188 --> 32:19.474
that actually had belonged to the Old Rail Book Department.

32:20.195 --> 32:25.783
And now they're going to have a list of three pages of endowed funds.

32:25.863 --> 32:30.089
Now, some of them don't bring in very much, and some of them bring in a month.

32:31.191 --> 32:44.149
But that, that court looks for, you know, these are usually just lists of funds that now exist.

32:48.905 --> 32:51.007
So you have somebody to work with each year?

32:51.528 --> 32:53.170
Oh, yeah.

32:53.190 --> 32:53.650
Oh, yeah.

32:53.810 --> 32:58.616
How much would you say you have for the acquisitions?

33:05.463 --> 33:11.290
That's the bottom line.

33:11.310 --> 33:12.551
I'm not sure how I'd hear what this is.

33:12.571 --> 33:14.914
That includes the state money.

33:14.934 --> 33:16.836
It's pushing in, isn't it?

33:17.322 --> 33:21.186
That's all together.

33:21.206 --> 33:22.848
That's good for acquisitions.

33:23.949 --> 33:28.193
Some of it is not restricted only to acquisitions.

33:29.034 --> 33:29.715
Most of it is.

33:30.916 --> 33:37.302
What is hard to fund from outside is any kind of operational expense.

33:37.322 --> 33:44.089
Very hard to get an endowment for pencils.

33:46.381 --> 33:48.363
Or processing, for example.

33:48.383 --> 33:51.287
This is one of the things that's a big problem for us.

33:51.307 --> 33:58.895
You know, we were very successful bringing in collections and archives and whatnot, but they're no good until they're processed.

33:58.935 --> 34:01.158
This is one of the digital fallacies.

34:01.178 --> 34:02.740
You know, while you digitize it, forget it.

34:03.681 --> 34:11.249
You can't digitize something that isn't processed without having got some order or some index imposed on it.

34:11.330 --> 34:16.135
But you are digitizing some of your collections, though, and making them available.

34:16.756 --> 34:18.478
I just had a chat with Barclay.

34:18.819 --> 34:19.500
Oh, yeah.

34:19.520 --> 34:20.781
Very, very interesting there.

34:21.102 --> 34:21.803
Yeah, Mike Barclay.

34:21.823 --> 34:25.227
He and I arrived on the scene here about 20 times.

34:25.247 --> 34:27.250
He's a philosopher, you know.

34:27.791 --> 34:29.753
He studied philosophy in the beginning.

34:29.773 --> 34:31.696
But it's also interesting that he wears both hats.

34:32.116 --> 34:33.398
Yeah, yeah.

34:33.418 --> 34:45.054
And he's been pushed into the position of the digital library controller guru.

34:46.055 --> 34:46.155
Yeah.

34:46.658 --> 34:48.961
You know, we're digitizing papyri at the moment.

34:48.981 --> 34:51.044
Even as we speak, we're digitizing papyri.

34:51.064 --> 34:56.111
And Barclay, as I see, is writing, heard on that.

34:56.432 --> 34:57.994
How the hell do you scan papyri?

34:59.016 --> 34:59.797
Very carefully.

34:59.817 --> 35:01.119
Yeah.

35:01.419 --> 35:02.400
They're mounted in glass.

35:04.303 --> 35:07.848
This is, we've gotten a lot of publicity over this.

35:08.810 --> 35:14.758
The papyri recovered from crocodile mummies, and then

35:15.430 --> 35:19.775
put up in plastic, and the plastic is just horrible, and so I had to undo that.

35:20.596 --> 35:25.922
And this is all part of my daily life, and it's been just a horrible worry of mine.

35:26.342 --> 35:28.925
There's been publicity that they've done stuff published on this?

35:28.945 --> 35:29.045
Yeah.

35:29.205 --> 35:29.485
Where?

35:32.769 --> 35:33.610
All over the place.

35:35.012 --> 35:36.333
Geez, I've just got that file.

35:37.114 --> 35:42.720
I could try and see if there's one thing that is good that would

35:46.733 --> 35:48.936
I'll throw stuff under here.

35:49.236 --> 35:50.418
Oops, sorry.

35:50.438 --> 35:55.285
I'm never leaving, getting tons of stuff.

35:56.226 --> 35:57.388
Oh, could we get a copy of that?

36:00.352 --> 36:01.113
Oh, great.

36:02.274 --> 36:03.696
This is kind of stupid.

36:03.716 --> 36:06.139
I'll find something better.

36:06.300 --> 36:07.081
Is that stupid, too?

36:07.141 --> 36:07.762
I can have that.

36:08.383 --> 36:10.465
I can run a copy this way.

36:11.627 --> 36:13.129
Anyway, it was just a Krone article.

36:13.700 --> 36:18.745
Yeah, this was the guy who wrote it all up from the press release and wrote it up as if he'd talked to me anyhow.

36:19.946 --> 36:21.227
That's why I hate the Chronicle.

36:21.247 --> 36:22.248
It's terrible in the newspaper.

36:22.669 --> 36:23.309
Oh, yes.

36:23.730 --> 36:31.117
I had a job to work here many years ago when I got out of the service and went back for it.

36:31.137 --> 36:33.459
I can find better stuff than that.

36:33.499 --> 36:36.222
But at least it'll give me something to know about it, though.

36:36.242 --> 36:43.048
Yeah, I will give you...

36:49.492 --> 36:52.677
He's just leaning and burgeoning all over life.

36:52.817 --> 36:58.425
You know, we've got this Cal Heritage Digity thing going on.

36:58.825 --> 37:00.328
We've got the papyri going on.

37:01.069 --> 37:04.133
Digitizing the papyri is nothing.

37:04.153 --> 37:06.276
The real problem is doing the conservation work.

37:07.518 --> 37:13.827
And so, in this day and age, you throw in a digital component so that you get the money to do what you really need to do.

37:13.847 --> 37:16.731
You just save the stuff before it goes under.

37:17.437 --> 37:25.064
This stuff was in plastic, which was damaging because it was flexible.

37:25.084 --> 37:30.889
So I had to get it out of those plastic mounts, which was done in the late 30s.

37:30.909 --> 37:34.933
And it will be explained in the other costume that I find it here.

37:34.953 --> 37:46.043
And to do that is very difficult, because as soon as you separate the two pieces of the plastic sandwich, you generate a huge static field.

37:46.850 --> 37:50.455
And, of course, the papyrus ensign wants to stick to one or the other or both.

37:52.418 --> 37:53.780
And this had stymied previous.

37:54.240 --> 37:56.624
Well, it's a pretty cautionary tale, isn't it, huh?

37:56.644 --> 37:57.084
Oh, yeah.

37:57.625 --> 38:01.550
And so I said, you know, this is a big university.

38:01.570 --> 38:02.832
We've got electrical engineers.

38:02.852 --> 38:05.716
So I picked up the phone and I called the electrical engineering department.

38:05.736 --> 38:07.519
I said, I got this bill.

38:08.941 --> 38:12.586
And I said, oh, well, you ought to talk to, what's her name?

38:12.606 --> 38:14.749
Alan Boros, I think was her name.

38:14.769 --> 38:15.810
Okay, so I got a hold of her.

38:16.617 --> 38:20.482
And I explained to her and she said, oh, okay, let me think about it.

38:20.502 --> 38:23.226
And she got back to me within the day.

38:23.627 --> 38:27.211
She said, well, you've got two options.

38:27.231 --> 38:37.465
You can use a wand of radioactive, I thought she said plutonium, or you can use an ionizing fan.

38:37.485 --> 38:40.870
I said, well, I don't think we want to have plutonium on that in the library.

38:41.271 --> 38:43.013
Oh, no, not plutonium, polonium.

38:43.246 --> 38:45.128
Life, only 90 days.

38:45.148 --> 38:46.149
Nowhere near as dangerous.

38:46.609 --> 38:51.574
I said, okay, fine.

38:51.594 --> 38:52.635
107.

38:54.056 --> 38:54.877
There you are.

38:54.897 --> 38:55.518
You got it right?

38:56.779 --> 38:58.280
Excellent.

38:58.300 --> 39:00.663
Give a paper clip here.

39:02.765 --> 39:03.966
I don't know what the heck this is.

39:04.066 --> 39:04.486
True truth.

39:04.987 --> 39:05.748
Yeah, good.

39:05.768 --> 39:06.829
You know what, I'm going to let you go.

39:06.849 --> 39:08.610
Say it again.

39:08.630 --> 39:11.413
I mean, what bothers me so much about the computer age is how

39:11.883 --> 39:19.213
undemocratic and, in a sense, elitist it is, because who has the access to all these wonderful resources?

39:19.233 --> 39:28.366
Well, it's the people who can fork out $2,500, $3,000 plus line charges to have them have a setup at hand.

39:28.386 --> 39:29.247
And that's just the beginning.

39:29.287 --> 39:30.408
Then we need software.

39:30.428 --> 39:32.531
Yeah, and then you have to figure it out.

39:33.693 --> 39:38.920
And we're talking about doing all of this from the

39:39.372 --> 39:41.935
for the K-12 schools.

39:42.555 --> 39:43.657
Why can't we just say schools?

39:43.717 --> 39:44.758
No, it has to be K-12.

39:45.779 --> 40:01.395
It just doesn't—I just don't see that it's going to get out there.

40:01.575 --> 40:05.920
Whereas, well, in the other words, they will object, well, yeah, but you had to go to the library.

40:06.845 --> 40:13.875
libraries are still there, and they're not very far from anybody, do they?

40:13.935 --> 40:15.417
And everybody was on the same footing.

40:15.878 --> 40:18.041
That at least was egalitarian.

40:18.962 --> 40:20.504
But now it's just whoever can pay.

40:22.026 --> 40:25.951
And the pressure in libraries is cost recovery.

40:26.873 --> 40:30.538
You're going to see libraries charging for anything they can get away with charging for.

40:33.101 --> 40:34.303
And that

40:34.908 --> 40:41.533
us old-time librarian types, it really goes against our grain.

40:41.553 --> 40:45.407
We're supposed to be dispensing knowledge for free.
