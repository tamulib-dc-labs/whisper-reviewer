WEBVTT

00:02.495 --> 00:11.248
Tell me what you brought.

00:11.268 --> 00:13.151
You brought 25 or so books?

00:13.732 --> 00:23.566
I collect association copies, books owned by significant figures in early American history and culture.

00:23.587 --> 00:29.295
And not just any book, a book about which I can tell a story, a book that

00:29.596 --> 00:39.672
had some sort of impact, whose reading is recorded in letters or journals or passages or commonplace books.

00:41.596 --> 00:48.026
They run from the 1660s through to the beginning of the Civil War.

00:49.268 --> 00:53.595
What I'm doing here is writing a kind of cultural history of America

00:54.689 --> 00:58.274
disguised as this catalog of my own library.

00:58.354 --> 01:00.518
So it's completely from the artifact up.

01:01.760 --> 01:10.833
I'm telling these stories about individual books and then linking them in a way so that it could be read as a continuous narrative.

01:11.995 --> 01:20.027
So, for instance, let me just sort of give you the beginning and end or some sense of... Can I pop a few shots while we're talking?

01:20.087 --> 01:20.828
Is that going to bother you?

01:20.848 --> 01:21.669
No, no, sure.

01:23.352 --> 01:23.532
Go ahead.

01:23.714 --> 01:43.005
Well, the two or three books that I'm starting with, one is a copy of John Cotton's works, the grandfather of Cotton Mather, the early New England minister who was a friend of Anne Hutchinson's.

01:43.846 --> 01:48.354
And his close friend, John Norton, wrote a biography of him.

01:48.434 --> 01:50.277
It's the first American biography.

01:50.317 --> 01:54.063
It's called Abel, while dead, yet speaketh.

01:55.606 --> 01:56.788
Wow.

01:57.008 --> 01:58.831
Abel, like the biblical character.

01:59.513 --> 02:01.596
While dead, yet speaketh.

02:01.656 --> 02:03.459
There's a real tense problem in there.

02:04.261 --> 02:08.588
And this is one of the books of Cotton's that he used in writing that.

02:09.007 --> 02:18.220
that first American biography in an effort to kind of memorialize cotton.

02:18.240 --> 02:23.608
Along with that, I have a book owned by Simon and Ed Bradstreet.

02:26.312 --> 02:29.316
This is a good example of a kind of book that interests me.

02:29.416 --> 02:33.242
One of her most famous poems is called Upon the Burning of My House.

02:33.712 --> 02:40.919
Her house caught fire in October of 1666, the same year as the Great Fire in London.

02:42.240 --> 02:59.938
And she writes this poem about how she needs to wean her affections from the things of this world, the table and chairs that she used to sit in, all these objects that were meaningful to her, in order to recognize that they were gods and he could take them back at will.

03:00.526 --> 03:04.129
and that the eternal things are awaiting her in heaven.

03:04.850 --> 03:12.337
Meanwhile, however, her husband has a completely different reaction to the fire.

03:12.477 --> 03:30.094
He's lost one of New England's largest libraries, and instead of writing a poem trying to reconcile it with his religious faith and offer himself some sort of Christian comfort, he desperately tries to replace the books that he's lost, which in 1666

03:30.682 --> 03:32.984
Massachusetts is pretty hard to do.

03:33.304 --> 03:34.626
He wants the same books?

03:34.666 --> 03:35.687
He wants the same books.

03:36.027 --> 03:37.308
Has he recorded this sometimes?

03:37.508 --> 03:37.608
Yeah.

03:37.628 --> 03:40.371
Well, he's recorded it in one of my books.

03:41.772 --> 03:50.700
What I have is a book that he bought 10 days after the fire from his son-in-law, who was John Cotton's son.

03:50.800 --> 03:58.107
This is Ann and Simon Bradstreet's daughter, Mary's John Cotton's son, whose name is Seaborne Cotton, born at sea.

03:58.643 --> 04:08.335
And he writes that brought from my brother, Reverend Seaborne Cotton, October 14, 1666.

04:09.116 --> 04:11.199
And this is one of his replacement volumes.

04:11.219 --> 04:12.040
Now that's in here?

04:12.100 --> 04:12.340
Yeah.

04:12.381 --> 04:13.682
He's recorded this in here.

04:13.702 --> 04:15.164
In the book, yeah.

04:15.204 --> 04:16.125
This is annotations.

04:16.286 --> 04:17.407
Yeah, yeah.

04:17.447 --> 04:18.649
Pardon me for interrupting.

04:18.749 --> 04:19.389
No, sure.

04:19.650 --> 04:22.473
Most of what I have are annotated books.

04:22.493 --> 04:24.516
So do we know about this book?

04:25.340 --> 04:28.086
From any other source, or is this basically the only source?

04:28.146 --> 04:29.529
Well, we know about the fire.

04:29.549 --> 04:32.575
We know about her poem about the fire.

04:33.818 --> 04:35.882
But his drive to replicate the library.

04:35.962 --> 04:38.808
Well, no.

04:38.888 --> 04:44.580
This is my inference from the fact that this book is dated 10 days after the fire, and it's a book...

04:45.185 --> 04:52.896
A key book that all ministers and magistrates would have is John Goodwin, Imputatio Fide.

04:52.916 --> 04:54.419
Do you get what you want?

04:54.439 --> 04:55.480
I interrupted.

04:55.560 --> 04:56.081
It's shameful.

04:56.121 --> 04:57.323
No, no, no, that's fine.

04:57.743 --> 05:03.272
I like the conversation.

05:03.292 --> 05:06.897
Do you have a list of some of these books that you have, or will I have to write them all down?

05:06.957 --> 05:09.361
No, I can give you a list.

05:09.381 --> 05:11.023
Because that way... Save it.

05:11.307 --> 05:12.268
It'll be better.

05:12.328 --> 05:13.189
Sure.

05:13.229 --> 05:15.211
That way it'll be accurate.

05:19.055 --> 05:22.178
This is now a 17th century film, isn't it?

05:22.198 --> 05:22.498
Yeah.

05:23.259 --> 05:39.475
So the book itself, and it's also signed by five other generations of Bradstreet's, but this book, 1642, Imputati of Fide, this is...

05:40.197 --> 05:47.587
Here it says, Simon Bradstreet, Brought of My Brother, Mr. Seaborn Cotton.

05:47.607 --> 05:47.967
Hello.

05:48.187 --> 05:48.868
How are you?

05:49.068 --> 05:50.210
Oh, thanks very much.

05:50.230 --> 05:50.711
Very well.

05:50.731 --> 05:51.752
Aren't you kind?

05:51.792 --> 05:53.755
We'll put that way away from the books.

05:53.775 --> 05:54.255
Right here.

05:54.275 --> 05:58.240
I've got it out of the water cooler, so it should be put in the water.

05:58.300 --> 05:58.641
Oh, good.

05:58.721 --> 05:59.061
Thanks.

06:00.904 --> 06:01.424
Look at that.

06:01.444 --> 06:08.854
Brought of My Brother, Mr. Seaborn Cotton, priced for Shelling's November 14, 1660.

06:08.952 --> 06:10.093
66.

06:10.173 --> 06:15.259
So this is right after the fire, and it's clearly a substitute book.

06:15.379 --> 06:24.529
And what happened, probably, and this is my pleasure, kind of reconstructing the circumstances of these books.

06:25.550 --> 06:32.217
The reason Seaborne Cotton would probably have two copies of this book is... I like the hand.

06:32.377 --> 06:32.918
Okay.

06:33.067 --> 06:41.843
is that his father, John Cotton, had died, and he had inherited some of his father's books, and it's likely that he had two copies then.

06:42.785 --> 06:48.536
So this book actually relates in some way to one of the most famous early American poems.

06:48.656 --> 06:50.960
It's the gendered other side of the story.

06:53.545 --> 06:56.070
This doesn't really do it justice, but...

06:57.637 --> 06:59.039
Where did you find that book?

06:59.780 --> 07:04.167
Well, I got it many years ago at Swan's.

07:05.128 --> 07:06.430
It was at an auction.

07:06.591 --> 07:07.132
Yeah.

07:07.152 --> 07:10.136
I mean, sometimes I get them from the family.

07:10.156 --> 07:16.706
I mean, for instance, here's something I got from the family.

07:17.327 --> 07:26.361
If you ask even scholars of early America, who was the first American to translate the Bible, probably nobody could answer you.

07:26.915 --> 07:36.287
A guy named Charles Thompson who was secretary of the Continental Congress and whose name is in print on the Declaration of Independence as the secretary, the recording secretary.

07:37.489 --> 07:47.261
And he served as secretary until Washington's election, so the Constitutional Convention as well through 89.

07:47.702 --> 07:51.046
Then he didn't get a job in Washington's administration.

07:51.747 --> 07:53.850
He fell into something of a depression

07:54.421 --> 08:01.628
And he decided that what he needed to do was devote his life to a translation of the Bible, but not just any translation.

08:03.269 --> 08:18.824
He decided he was going to translate the Septuagint Bible because the Greek Old Testament, the Greek translation from the Hebrew, was probably what Christ himself used.

08:19.005 --> 08:22.588
And so when Christ talks about himself as the fulfillment of various

08:22.889 --> 08:27.715
Old Testament prophecies, you really need access to the Greek Old Testament.

08:28.336 --> 08:36.547
So he got a hold of a 16th century printing of the Greek Old Testament and translated it.

08:38.529 --> 08:52.828
Because in a sense, the New Testament is the spiritual fulfillment of the Old Testament, and America is sort of the historical fulfillment of the Old Testament as a new Israel, etc.,

08:53.517 --> 08:57.564
So it came out, and of course it died.

08:57.624 --> 08:59.787
Who wants to buy anything but the King James?

09:00.228 --> 09:01.851
It's a very weird translation.

09:04.375 --> 09:11.226
It begins, I love this, in the beginning God created heaven and the earth, and the earth was invisible and unfurnished.

09:11.727 --> 09:15.433
The Chippendale furniture hadn't... Whose markings are these?

09:15.453 --> 09:16.355
Well, these are his.

09:17.597 --> 09:19.440
What happened is that...

09:21.142 --> 09:26.892
He decided he was going to do a second edition, and he spent the next 10 years of his life revising.

09:27.974 --> 09:34.806
And these are his unpublished revisions of the first American translation of the Bible.

09:35.687 --> 09:43.200
And some of these notes also make connections between biblical figures and

09:43.737 --> 09:48.845
and American history.

09:50.547 --> 10:02.325
So there's four volumes of this, and this came directly from the family who sold it for a song.

10:02.365 --> 10:10.217
They just had no interest or appreciation of it, but it's this extraordinary document.

10:11.345 --> 10:25.523
So all of these are books about which I can tell stories, the circumstance of the first American translating the Bible, which has something to do with trying to understand why he didn't get a job in Washington's administration.

10:25.543 --> 10:32.592
There must be something wrong with American history, and that means you've got to understand the Bible to get out what's wrong with American history.

10:32.612 --> 10:36.617
Now, if you know this beforehand... Well, it's a combination.

10:36.797 --> 10:40.542
When a book comes up or it's offered to me, I rush to do some research

10:41.028 --> 10:45.914
So I'm always doing some before the fact, but most of it is done after the fact.

10:45.954 --> 10:52.962
But I've got to be convinced there's a story to tell before I buy the book.

10:53.002 --> 10:55.786
And most of these books are bought from quotations.

10:57.928 --> 10:59.690
Quotations, from dealers.

10:59.810 --> 11:01.913
From dealers, descriptions and catalogs.

11:02.373 --> 11:07.339
Well, yeah, though at this point, virtually everybody knows what I collect.

11:07.399 --> 11:09.702
So the bookseller is obviously doing some...

11:10.323 --> 11:14.529
He's doing some research, and I'm building on his research.

11:15.010 --> 11:18.174
And then sometimes people build on my own.

11:18.234 --> 11:21.139
The bookseller is bringing some of the narrative to you.

11:21.159 --> 11:24.864
Yeah, I mean, that's what good booksellers do, is they create value.

11:25.445 --> 11:33.136
They take a $100 book, they beat on it until it's a $1,000 book, and they do that by being able to tell a story about a book.

11:33.236 --> 11:34.358
Why was this important?

11:34.859 --> 11:37.883
Why was it important that this person owned this book?

11:38.605 --> 11:45.294
And in a sense, that's what I'm not doing, not in the surface of being able to enhance the price on it, because I don't sell these books.

11:45.314 --> 11:51.363
This quote will get into my chapter on scholar book science.

11:51.443 --> 11:51.803
Okay.

11:52.004 --> 11:54.107
Sure, sure, fine.

11:54.127 --> 11:57.191
Let me just run through a couple of these, give you a sense of things.

11:57.411 --> 12:00.295
And don't mind my asking questions by a scattershot way.

12:00.315 --> 12:01.417
No, absolutely.

12:03.039 --> 12:03.600
Okay.

12:06.365 --> 12:11.232
You had estimated the collection at about 600 volumes, I think.

12:11.292 --> 12:13.615
Is that about right?

12:14.035 --> 12:16.218
Yeah, it's about 500.

12:21.205 --> 12:24.029
It has three sub-collections in it.

12:24.169 --> 12:28.234
One on Jonathan Edwards, one on Jefferson, and one on Melville.

12:28.334 --> 12:30.297
I have a large number of books.

12:30.952 --> 12:34.738
relating to those three figures and books owned by those three figures.

12:34.958 --> 12:37.241
Does this also reflect your teaching as well?

12:37.261 --> 12:39.325
Yes, all these books I use in my teaching.

12:39.825 --> 12:44.893
I can't teach a book that I don't have physically in front of me.

12:46.435 --> 12:55.629
Because the text of the book or the ideas of the book or the language of the book can be gotten at in a paperback form.

12:55.649 --> 12:58.213
But there's something about knowing what the book looked like.

12:59.094 --> 12:59.575
And...

13:00.297 --> 13:02.260
How do you read cues?

13:02.420 --> 13:08.649
For instance, a certain binding tells you it's addressed to a certain audience or a certain price does that.

13:08.689 --> 13:10.572
There's a certain set of expectations.

13:11.213 --> 13:16.080
You look at booksellers, ads in the book, and you have a sense of the company that book is keeping.

13:16.100 --> 13:18.183
And there's a big difference.

13:18.223 --> 13:24.432
If you have a monument, for instance, I just bought this enormous volume, the largest volume published in America.

13:24.850 --> 13:26.853
in the early colonial period.

13:26.914 --> 13:30.420
Samuel Willard's Complete Body of Divinity weighs about 15 pounds.

13:30.860 --> 13:33.325
It's Jonathan Edwards' copy.

13:34.647 --> 13:38.453
This is a book that is meant to, A, be consulted.

13:38.594 --> 13:40.897
It's not a duodecimer that you carry around.

13:42.520 --> 13:46.487
It implies a certain kind of setting, a library setting.

13:47.108 --> 13:50.091
In a sense, the book is more important than the text.

13:50.131 --> 13:55.356
And what I mean by that is these are 250 sermons that sort of summarize Puritan doctrines.

13:55.696 --> 13:57.898
The book's called The Complete Body of Divinity.

13:58.479 --> 14:00.641
And in a sense, the book is that body.

14:01.241 --> 14:03.003
This enormous book sits there.

14:03.063 --> 14:13.072
And owning it or being a subscriber to it makes you part of a community that subscribes to this doctrine.

14:13.112 --> 14:16.035
And you don't need to reread the whole book to get at the doctrine.

14:16.437 --> 14:22.503
In a sense, all these books are about the presence of the past in the present.

14:23.404 --> 14:28.609
And this is the orthodox divinity from the generation before Edwards.

14:29.650 --> 14:32.692
And his owning it is a kind of paean to it.

14:32.712 --> 14:37.837
It's an acknowledgement of the weightiness of that doctrine.

14:38.818 --> 14:46.005
And it, you know, in a sense, it's a kind of almost

14:46.357 --> 14:48.779
like a double for the body of the author.

14:49.320 --> 14:59.570
This folio kind of protects New England from these various heresies that appear in little pamphlets.

14:59.990 --> 15:05.896
This is sort of the monument, the armor that's used against it.

15:06.717 --> 15:15.165
And it's interesting, in the case of Willard, there's a sort of defensive note in the book that says this is the first folio printed

15:15.972 --> 15:19.297
in New England except law books.

15:20.459 --> 15:26.929
And there's a kind of debate for cultural authority in America in the early 18th century.

15:26.969 --> 15:29.794
Are the lawyers running the show or are the ministers running the show?

15:30.455 --> 15:43.195
And the lawyers have their enormous tones that signify their cultural authority, just the size and bulk of it and the calf as opposed to sheep which is used on

15:43.495 --> 15:46.179
many cheaper New England bindings.

15:46.519 --> 15:55.813
And so now divinity, New England divinity, has its own massive folio to sort of lay against the legal folios.

15:55.853 --> 15:59.177
And it took a number of compositors to put this together.

15:59.197 --> 16:02.182
So there are all kinds of problems in the pagination.

16:02.502 --> 16:06.728
This was beyond the ability of the press at the time.

16:06.748 --> 16:07.950
Is this a scarce book?

16:09.837 --> 16:13.341
Yes, outside of institutions, it's a scarce book.

16:13.362 --> 16:22.754
But because it was highly subscribed to, it had a print run probably of 1,000 copies, which was for 1726 a lot.

16:22.954 --> 16:25.878
And it's a very meaningful book in Edward's career.

16:25.918 --> 16:29.302
This is a key figure that influenced his thinking.

16:30.103 --> 16:36.351
So for me, I'm interested in reading over the shoulder of previous readers.

16:36.955 --> 16:48.487
and understanding what a book means emotionally to somebody, not just intellectually, that Edwards owned this, was proud of it, participates in the book by writing his name.

16:48.747 --> 16:56.715
I mean, margins are there to call forth your markings.

16:57.095 --> 16:59.177
The book has to be brought to life.

16:59.237 --> 17:01.900
It's a dead object until you open it to read it.

17:02.605 --> 17:17.800
And in a sense, the participation of reading extends to the participation of writing in books, whether it's simply Jonathan Edwards, his book, and often it says, as in this case, the gift of, and it's from his brother-in-law.

17:18.761 --> 17:25.728
Many of these operate in a kind of gift culture where one family member gives it to another.

17:26.288 --> 17:29.131
And it's a binding operation.

17:29.171 --> 17:31.313
It creates a sort of drama of risk and positive.

17:31.732 --> 17:32.693
reciprocity.

17:32.813 --> 17:34.995
I've given you this and later you'll give me this.

17:35.776 --> 17:42.962
It becomes a family heirloom as well as locating Edwards in a certain kind of intellectual tradition.

17:43.343 --> 17:45.224
What was the date of that?

17:45.244 --> 17:45.525
1726.

17:47.767 --> 17:55.314
In that sense, let me just talk personally because I project this back on a lot of owners.

17:57.536 --> 17:59.157
Reading a book is one thing.

17:59.322 --> 18:01.685
But owning a book is something different.

18:03.408 --> 18:04.750
I find it comforting.

18:05.291 --> 18:23.257
I find it almost a kind of anxiety reduction, a certain form of self-medication to be in my library, to sort of have this connection with all these previous readers, these famous people, Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Franklin.

18:23.297 --> 18:24.839
I have books from all their libraries.

18:25.840 --> 18:28.384
And reading the actual copy they read,

18:28.668 --> 18:38.018
And even more interesting, looking at the annotations, researching their letters, did they talk about this book when they first acquired it?

18:38.999 --> 18:44.404
And the sense of how it makes you feel about yourself to have this book here.

18:44.424 --> 18:48.208
I mean, a library is a kind of externalized autobiography.

18:48.829 --> 18:57.898
The books are markers of the moment you bought it, the moment you read it, the circumstances, intellectually and emotionally.

18:58.233 --> 19:06.064
And so you revisit moments in your life that are strung together, kind of bead-like, in this library.

19:06.465 --> 19:19.043
So this is a book, Edwards, for example, would have consulted multiple times and would have felt good about, it's almost a political statement, I belong to the party of orthodoxy, is indicated by the fact that I have this book.

19:19.083 --> 19:27.295
And I do it, I'm doing it too, in the way that I...

19:27.578 --> 19:57.450
kind of commune with these books, there's a sense that not only are they alive, because there's a speaking voice that's endlessly conjurable from the physical object, but the experience of reading, at least for me, and I think it's true for most of the people whose books I have, provides a set of terms, a set of situations, categories to interpret your own experience.

19:58.291 --> 20:04.019
that we see the world in part through our previous experience, but we also see it through our previous reading.

20:05.101 --> 20:18.139
And Clinton is like a Shakespearean tragic figure, that we're endlessly understanding our present through these books.

20:18.179 --> 20:25.750
And so they have a kind of a mental existence as a way of making certain things recognizable

20:26.287 --> 20:29.691
because we've seen it not in life, but we've seen it in art.

20:30.632 --> 20:52.800
And just to add to that point, one of the things that I've discovered in reading over the shoulder of all these readers is that often what goes on in reading is not a passive reception of information, but it is a surprising articulation of your own thoughts that you discover what you're really feeling

20:53.489 --> 20:58.355
by reading somebody say something that you say, that's right.

20:59.036 --> 21:13.394
Or we're always reading certain passages more intensely than others because our immediate emotional situation gives us a kind of intense privilege access to something where suddenly we understand it because we're sort of feeling the same way.

21:13.695 --> 21:16.358
Let me give you one example from my own life.

21:16.979 --> 21:22.285
I had to teach Tender is the Night for a college.

21:22.345 --> 21:24.909
I usually teach 18th and 19th century, not 20th.

21:24.929 --> 21:29.194
I had to teach Tender is the Night on a quick basis.

21:29.414 --> 21:31.176
The guy couldn't make the class up.

21:31.196 --> 21:34.761
So I dug up my college copy of Tender is the Night to reread it.

21:35.361 --> 21:39.907
And there I hid a passage about Dick Diver, the psychiatrist.

21:40.788 --> 21:43.251
It's a quite negative passage about him.

21:43.311 --> 21:45.113
And next to it, in the handwriting,

21:45.329 --> 21:48.913
of my college girlfriend are the letters JWF.

21:50.794 --> 21:51.976
My initials.

21:53.077 --> 21:59.243
So here, 20 years later, she's reading this while she's angry at me and while we're breaking up.

22:00.084 --> 22:03.307
And so she's deeply occupied with the book.

22:03.487 --> 22:08.332
She's reading it, but she's also deeply preoccupied by what's going on in her life.

22:08.733 --> 22:11.235
And suddenly this passage...

22:11.418 --> 22:16.024
becomes about me and not about Dick Diver, and she marks it that way.

22:16.124 --> 22:20.049
Do you think of the expectation that you... No, no, of course not.

22:20.090 --> 22:31.284
But 25 years later, I'm witnessing this, I'm seeing her anger on the page as she's yoking her life and the book's text together.

22:31.304 --> 22:32.406
Go ahead.

22:32.426 --> 22:37.593
Yeah, and affixing my name.

22:37.873 --> 22:40.817
What makes you so sure that she was identifying you with Diver?

22:41.540 --> 22:44.724
Well, I still have this book.

22:44.744 --> 22:47.787
The paragraph is about, there's a paragraph that's marked.

22:48.488 --> 22:51.812
She's marked off the paragraph and said, J.W.S.

22:51.832 --> 22:52.352
This is you.

22:52.612 --> 22:54.154
Yeah, but no, this is me.

22:54.735 --> 22:57.258
Unflattering, I gather.

22:57.538 --> 22:59.921
Yeah, completely unflattering.

23:00.581 --> 23:02.423
He basically marries his patient.

23:02.443 --> 23:03.765
He controls her.

23:06.007 --> 23:08.290
She was younger, etc.

23:08.590 --> 23:17.942
And it's that sort of, it's so that in reading you're learning about what you feel at the moment, not just about the reading.

23:18.023 --> 23:22.529
It's that kind of extraordinary shock of recognition and articulation.

23:23.330 --> 23:30.419
So some of these books are, for example, if you take this extraordinary book, this is Jefferson's copy of Paradise Lost.

23:32.922 --> 23:36.387
Jefferson didn't mark his books up.

23:36.890 --> 23:38.653
John Adams did.

23:38.693 --> 23:45.583
For instance, John Adams, there are some books of John Adams with six or seven thousand words of annotations in a single book.

23:46.504 --> 23:53.214
Because for him, reading is a conversation with the author, and if he disagrees, he's got to tell the author immediately, this is Adams.

23:53.554 --> 24:03.589
And I have one annotated book from his library where he's, in a sense, intimidated by the learning of the author

24:04.193 --> 24:16.343
who is using all these Greek words, and Adams, who knew Greek, responds by annotating it in Greek in this kind of tit-for-tat.

24:16.363 --> 24:23.609
But what Jefferson did, in contrast, is he kept a commonplace book in which he transcribed passages from his reading.

24:24.370 --> 24:33.998
And in his literary commonplace book, a large number of the early passages are copied from this very book, and they're mostly about Satan

24:34.670 --> 24:42.779
How come this didn't go on to the University of Virginia or the Library of Congress or some sort of place?

24:43.600 --> 24:48.306
I have to ask it because I'll forget it.

24:48.786 --> 25:03.343
In the winter of 1784, Madison, who was sort of deciding what he was going to do with his life, spent the winter reading books from Jefferson's library that would be taken down from Monticello to Montpelier

25:04.100 --> 25:09.988
by the minister whose parish, whose Anglican parish separated the two.

25:10.649 --> 25:18.941
This ended up in the parish, in the minister's own library, never having returned to Jefferson ultimately.

25:18.961 --> 25:24.549
Well, it did, then it went... Anyway, it ended up in the minister's library.

25:24.629 --> 25:25.290
He didn't return it.

25:25.310 --> 25:26.852
He kept it like what happens all the time.

25:26.872 --> 25:27.433
He kept it.

25:28.154 --> 25:29.736
And Madison...

25:29.969 --> 25:34.996
when he was reading it was the time Jefferson was leaving to go to Paris as a minister.

25:35.016 --> 25:36.818
This is also passed through Madison's hands.

25:37.098 --> 25:40.763
This is the only known book signed by both Jefferson and Madison.

25:41.444 --> 25:43.587
Jefferson almost never signed his books.

25:43.627 --> 25:48.213
He used this initial encoder, which you probably assume.

25:49.735 --> 25:56.263
But there are about 1,000-plus books in the Library of Congress and in Aldermen and elsewhere.

25:56.632 --> 26:01.080
There are about only five that exist that have signatures.

26:01.200 --> 26:09.454
One of the sort of research projects for me was to why do these five have signatures, and all the others have initials.

26:10.356 --> 26:13.621
They all have one thing in common, and that's this.

26:18.349 --> 26:21.154
That's Jefferson's signature.

26:21.607 --> 26:24.530
On the title page.

26:24.550 --> 26:25.551
On the title page.

26:25.932 --> 26:34.441
Paradise Lost was constantly invoked during the American Revolution, because there was an analogy between the war and heaven.

26:35.842 --> 26:44.311
But you'll notice, if you look carefully here, that this is James Madison's signature, which he has tried to erase.

26:44.351 --> 26:46.434
This is also on the title page.

26:46.614 --> 26:48.175
Right.

26:48.656 --> 26:50.618
Here's Madison.

26:50.902 --> 26:52.283
writing his name three times.

26:52.343 --> 26:53.845
His pen is running out of ink.

26:53.905 --> 26:54.646
Where are we now?

26:55.447 --> 26:56.868
On the back of the title page.

26:57.288 --> 27:01.913
So basically what happened was Jefferson lent this to Madison.

27:03.114 --> 27:08.980
Madison, since Jefferson was away for four years, decided to write his name in it.

27:09.701 --> 27:14.606
Jefferson got it back at some point and tried to erase his name.

27:15.206 --> 27:17.368
And this is what all these books have in common.

27:17.468 --> 27:20.031
A failed erasure on the title page.

27:20.551 --> 27:29.585
In other words, once somebody else had defaced the book, and he failed to completely get rid of it, that sort of forced his hand.

27:29.645 --> 27:37.056
And he then had to acknowledge his name on this, left somebody... But all these other books have this in common?

27:37.076 --> 27:37.837
You've examined them?

27:38.458 --> 27:42.404
Well, I haven't examined them, but I told about them.

27:42.424 --> 27:44.888
Well, two others are signed by his father.

27:45.323 --> 27:52.872
and both their signatures are, and they're both relatively new, I mean relatively old.

27:53.593 --> 27:54.374
This is 1751.

27:56.336 --> 27:59.440
Jefferson lived with his four sisters and his mother.

27:59.460 --> 28:06.489
His father had died when he was relatively young, and to some degree his library is a kind of father figure.

28:07.290 --> 28:08.992
But he began to dislike women.

28:09.753 --> 28:10.233
Jefferson?

28:10.333 --> 28:13.457
Yeah, living with all these women.

28:14.163 --> 28:17.647
One of the earliest things he... I'm just looking.

28:17.727 --> 28:18.128
Yeah, sure.

28:18.889 --> 28:28.841
One of the earliest things he copies out into his commonplace books are all these passages about how Eve has brought... But he didn't get these, did he?

28:28.861 --> 28:31.785
He didn't try to... No, he didn't try to... Go ahead, I'm listening.

28:32.926 --> 28:34.528
Eve has brought evil into the world.

28:34.609 --> 28:42.178
All these misogynist passages out of Milton appearing his late teens in his commonplace book.

28:42.833 --> 28:52.623
And then later, he keys to Satan as a kind of romantic hero, much as Blake would do, that the real hero is Satan.

28:52.683 --> 29:03.213
So the passages he quotes in his commonplace book are things like Satan saying, I'd rather rule in hell than be subservient in heaven.

29:03.233 --> 29:05.555
Suddenly, Satan becomes a revolutionary.

29:06.036 --> 29:12.402
So the book, in fact, in common sense, Paine's common sense, the only authority

29:12.972 --> 29:16.778
The only person quoted, because Paine didn't like to use authorities.

29:16.818 --> 29:19.221
He wanted to make the case his argument was self-evident.

29:19.241 --> 29:21.485
Why need all these old authorities?

29:22.326 --> 29:23.928
But he quotes from Paradise Lost.

29:23.969 --> 29:30.338
He doesn't tell his reader that he's actually quoting Satan, who says, we are beyond reconcilement.

29:30.518 --> 29:41.595
So Jefferson, over about a 20-year period, he owned a number of copies of Paradise Lost, but this matches exactly the...

29:42.638 --> 29:45.701
lineation, the capitalization, the punctuation.

29:46.121 --> 29:54.228
In the 18th century, different editions of Milton differed widely on matters of punctuation and lineation.

29:54.248 --> 29:59.773
I've checked this against his entries, and this is the copy.

29:59.854 --> 30:04.918
For him, this is a way of understanding and expressing his feelings.

30:05.018 --> 30:12.645
He's not so much interested in what Milton says, but what does what Milton say allow me to say by surrogating

30:13.013 --> 30:20.681
rather than saying... But now you're talking about this process allows you to more or less lean over the shoulder of the reader.

30:20.701 --> 30:20.922
Yeah.

30:21.863 --> 30:24.285
That almost implies that you need annotations, doesn't it?

30:25.066 --> 30:26.347
Well... And here you don't.

30:26.428 --> 30:27.288
You really have any.

30:27.329 --> 30:33.495
You have a commonplace book which will help you... Well, we have a commonplace book where passages are taken out of this book.

30:34.236 --> 30:35.638
Or at least out of this edition.

30:35.758 --> 30:37.940
This is the only edition that's signed by him.

30:37.980 --> 30:42.565
So this is the... Yeah, you... Well, sometimes...

30:43.017 --> 30:48.004
For you to tell me what you just told me, there has to be some other record, doesn't there?

30:48.144 --> 30:48.825
Yes and no.

30:50.247 --> 30:54.793
Sometimes I can pull it out of thin air.

30:54.813 --> 30:59.299
Here's a work of Defoe's.

30:59.379 --> 31:01.782
Just describe from my tape recorder the size of the book.

31:02.283 --> 31:05.667
This is a small folio, jure divino, a satire.

31:05.883 --> 31:08.906
written by... J-U-R-E-D-I-V-I-N-O.

31:08.926 --> 31:09.386
Right.

31:09.466 --> 31:11.708
A satire, S-A-T-Y-R.

31:11.788 --> 31:13.009
Yeah, the old spelling.

31:14.651 --> 31:15.592
London 1706.

31:18.314 --> 31:29.904
Well, the earliest play written in America that was produced in America was a political satire called Androboros after Governor Andros.

31:30.705 --> 31:32.927
And it was written by a guy named Robert Hunter.

31:34.008 --> 31:35.029
And it was based

31:35.296 --> 31:37.860
on the satires of Defoe.

31:38.862 --> 31:43.449
This is Hunter's signature that I've authenticated against known signatures.

31:43.870 --> 31:45.072
It's at the back of the book.

31:45.132 --> 31:46.173
It's at the back of the book.

31:47.135 --> 31:53.265
I know from the play, the text of the play, that he is drawing on Defoe.

31:53.685 --> 31:57.411
Yes, there it's triangulated by the existence of something he wrote.

31:59.675 --> 32:02.299
This is a book that was actually used in the writing

32:02.802 --> 32:22.811
of the first American play, or to give you something even more extraordinary, sometimes you own a book in order to hate the book.

32:22.831 --> 32:30.442
The Peter Zenger trial, his lawyer was Andrew Hamilton, not to be confused with Alexander Hamilton.

32:30.462 --> 32:32.725
In Andrew Hamilton's defense,

32:33.143 --> 32:48.918
was that even though all the law books say that truth is not a defense against libel, he's arguing it is.

32:50.099 --> 32:53.142
The truth is a defense against libel.

32:53.483 --> 32:54.564
No, it's not a defense.

32:54.584 --> 32:58.888
It's one who's constantly concerned about these matters.

32:58.908 --> 33:01.210
Hamilton is the first guy to make the argument.

33:01.510 --> 33:12.325
The previous argument had been, even if it's true, it still demeans and compromises the authority of people in power, whether it's magistrates or ministers.

33:12.826 --> 33:14.589
So it doesn't matter if it's true.

33:15.129 --> 33:23.882
It is not for you to use a public forum to say things that blaspheme authorities.

33:24.683 --> 33:28.108
And the essence of Hamilton's defense is

33:28.662 --> 33:38.442
Not only do we know that this governor is guilty of all these things, we see the corruption all around us, but truth should be a defense.

33:39.204 --> 33:41.368
And in this case, it's a self-evidentry.

33:42.571 --> 33:46.198
And the book that he used at the trial...

33:55.797 --> 33:58.400
Condition is irrelevant.

33:58.420 --> 33:59.221
Condition is completely.

33:59.361 --> 34:04.287
In fact, the more read, if it's read to death, that's what I love.

34:05.769 --> 34:16.722
I'm interested in books that, when Jefferson says, for example, how can I live without books, or whatever that quote is, I can't live without books, what does that really mean?

34:16.842 --> 34:18.544
What's the emotional payoff?

34:19.645 --> 34:25.332
Endlessly, I see letters of early Americans saying, this book was my boon companion,

34:25.649 --> 34:39.064
My Best Friend," or I have a book owned by Catherine Sedgwick, the early American novelist, who says, this book has seen me through the 40 years of the vicissitudes of life.

34:40.746 --> 34:47.673
So the book becomes an important relationship, as important as the relationship with a family member.

34:48.154 --> 34:52.078
There's a kind of physical intimacy she carries it around with her.

34:52.227 --> 34:57.532
And instead of talking to people, or in addition to talking to people, when she's upset, she turns to the Psalms.

34:58.132 --> 34:59.834
This is her life companion.

34:59.974 --> 35:03.537
So the book becomes a sort of person in her life.

35:03.557 --> 35:07.401
Anyway, Hamilton here, that's Alexander Hamilton.

35:07.541 --> 35:12.645
I'm sorry, Andrew Hamilton, who's also signed it here.

35:12.665 --> 35:21.053
This book, Instructor Clara Callis, was sort of the basic law book that all these early American lawyers had.

35:21.657 --> 35:26.884
And it deals with slander, among other things.

35:27.124 --> 35:36.056
And it gives the standard line that truth is not a defense against the accusation of slander.

35:37.198 --> 35:45.609
And one of the really radical things that Hamilton does is to say, it doesn't matter what precedent says.

35:45.829 --> 35:50.415
It doesn't matter what the weight of all this past common law

35:51.070 --> 36:06.166
and so he dismisses the books in favor of common sense, because a lot of these books come from a worldview in which the past has a wisdom that needs to be transmitted to the present, and it's crucial to have these books as transmitters.

36:06.406 --> 36:09.370
You don't reinvent the world's wisdom every generation.

36:09.770 --> 36:16.938
This is a very largely backward-looking, reverential, filiopietistic culture, and... Filio-what?

36:17.418 --> 36:20.942
Filiopietistic, the piety of the

36:21.158 --> 36:22.940
The Son's Piety for the Fathers.

36:25.083 --> 36:28.067
F-I-L-E-O, right?

36:28.087 --> 36:33.675
It's F-I-L-E-O-I-O, I mean.

36:33.695 --> 36:34.936
It's a word, right?

36:34.976 --> 36:36.158
Yeah, yeah.

36:36.178 --> 36:36.659
It's a word.

36:37.780 --> 36:51.098
So paradoxically, this is a book that he is arguing against and a book that he almost... he had to have consulted because this is the standard...

36:51.432 --> 37:02.529
book in which the definition of the slander law is... So when you come to write your essay about this book... It allows me to tell... The subtext is going to be the Zenger trial.

37:02.689 --> 37:03.190
Absolutely.

37:03.871 --> 37:10.941
Because I'm looking at books as witnesses, as historical witnesses to particular moments, sometimes very powerful moments.

37:12.844 --> 37:19.414
For instance, while the Louisiana Purchase was being negotiated by a guy named Robert Livingston for Jefferson,

37:20.255 --> 37:24.980
a French philosopher by the name of Volney came to his door.

37:25.060 --> 37:26.601
V-O-L-N-E-Y.

37:28.102 --> 37:40.855
Volney had written a very famous book a decade earlier called The Ruins of Empires, that nations should not become so proud because history is not progressive and linear, it's cyclical.

37:41.635 --> 37:49.603
And as America doubles its size on the eve of its sort of becoming an empire, he gives this to Livingston as a sort of cautionary

37:49.837 --> 37:54.202
text for America to beware.

37:54.803 --> 38:11.663
And so that book marks a specific moment in the negotiation to the Louisiana Purchase where it's offered as a kind of warning and it survives today.

38:11.903 --> 38:13.285
Is this a collection in your view?

38:13.886 --> 38:14.587
Oh, absolutely.

38:14.647 --> 38:14.967
There are

38:15.790 --> 38:16.231
Yeah.

38:16.311 --> 38:20.136
And you're... I mean, it is, but do you see it as a collection?

38:20.156 --> 38:20.617
Oh, absolutely.

38:20.717 --> 38:21.017
Yes.

38:21.378 --> 38:25.243
Well, what only do I see... I'm trying to establish motivation here.

38:25.263 --> 38:40.985
I wake up sometimes in the middle of the night and will go to my library and move a book from one shelf to another because in the middle of the night I thought about certain connections between the two, that this author and this author or something, and I want the moments to commune with one another.

38:41.986 --> 38:42.447
Physically.

38:42.647 --> 38:44.009
Physically, yeah.

38:44.350 --> 38:44.650
What...

38:44.900 --> 38:50.606
becomes visible when you bring these two things together that's not visible when they're kept apart.

38:51.767 --> 38:55.431
Give me an example of what you might be talking about here.

38:55.531 --> 38:56.132
Sure.

38:59.455 --> 39:05.502
Just think of something that might be appropriate that would make a pretty good example.

39:05.682 --> 39:06.443
Well, alright.

39:07.163 --> 39:09.786
Take this book.

39:09.806 --> 39:14.451
When we think of the Puritans, we think of people who are

39:14.954 --> 39:18.298
that it's a Bible culture.

39:18.318 --> 39:31.996
But Puritans in the 17th century also believed in astrology, which runs counter to the notion of providence, that it mattered what star you were born under and whether this was in ascent or this was in descent.

39:32.517 --> 39:36.982
And the almanacs of the period are full of these sorts of things.

39:38.084 --> 39:44.472
And so in this book, this book is called Christian Astrology.

39:44.890 --> 39:48.574
It's an effort to reconcile these two worlds.

39:50.075 --> 40:04.329
And Christian astrology, erecting a scheme of heaven, nature of the twelve signs, and a methodical way instructeth the student how to judge or resolve all manner of questions contingent unto man.

40:04.689 --> 40:11.575
Basically how to read your, it's almost like palm reading, how to read your future based on your sign.

40:11.836 --> 40:13.277
But then it even goes further.

40:13.595 --> 40:19.342
The third contains an exact method whereby to judge upon nativity, several ways how to rectify them.

40:20.083 --> 40:22.346
You're born under a bad sign, but wait.

40:22.767 --> 40:27.233
There are ways you might use to rectify them.

40:27.253 --> 40:27.533
1647.

40:28.434 --> 40:33.240
Well, this book was owned by Edward Holyoke, who later became president of Harvard.

40:33.260 --> 40:35.744
This, by the way, is a 1704 American book plate.

40:35.764 --> 40:37.566
You don't find it much earlier than that.

40:38.407 --> 40:40.750
And Holyoke issued a series of almanacs.

40:41.303 --> 40:44.287
and his almanacs draw on this book.

40:44.927 --> 40:48.552
And he learns how to make almanacs, and it's annotated by him.

40:49.933 --> 40:51.355
It's a wrote, apparently.

40:51.835 --> 40:52.456
Look at that.

40:52.476 --> 40:53.658
Extensive, heavily annotated.

40:53.678 --> 41:02.168
Well, and not only that, if you look at this page, this chapter of the book tells you how to do what's called an ephemeris.

41:03.169 --> 41:10.838
The lunar, you know, the tides and the moons and the setting of the sun, all these mathematical formulas.

41:11.240 --> 41:21.251
This is his manuscript, Ephemeris, that he used in the preparation of his 1709 almanac.

41:21.492 --> 41:34.246
So this astrology book was used by an early American almanac maker who took for granted what we would call now the magical thinking of astrology.

41:34.806 --> 41:40.673
And if you set this book, it's a 1640s book, against something like Willard's,

41:40.973 --> 41:42.636
complete body of divinity.

41:43.517 --> 41:59.521
Then you've got this sense of what David calls that the Puritans were also sort of wayward Elizabethans who were full of these Elizabethan superstitions.

42:01.143 --> 42:04.769
So for me, this is sort of the secret world of the Puritans.

42:04.809 --> 42:06.171
This is not theology.

42:06.708 --> 42:11.454
And in a sense, it compensates for what theology can't offer you.

42:12.215 --> 42:25.893
If God has made a decision, a predestination, about your eternal afterlife and there's nothing you can do about it, well, then astrology becomes pretty attractive because astrology offers some ways to deal with it.

42:25.913 --> 42:27.655
How do you translate the Latin in the book, please?

42:29.437 --> 42:34.504
It's...

42:36.492 --> 42:44.742
The jury is speaking.

42:44.802 --> 42:53.473
This is something like hold me to my speech or something.

42:53.893 --> 42:57.117
No, no, no.

42:58.666 --> 43:02.189
This, by the way, is in a 1704 binding.

43:03.951 --> 43:08.175
We know that because we can match the ornaments, the printer's ornaments.

43:08.916 --> 43:13.580
And you notice that that sheet was tipped, it's bound in.

43:13.641 --> 43:19.226
So the book, here's Holyoke's signature in six, the book was rebound.

43:19.326 --> 43:22.389
It's a 1647 book, so it couldn't have had that in it.

43:22.469 --> 43:28.555
It was rebound when he bought it, about 1706, and the ornaments match a binder's ornaments.

43:28.855 --> 43:30.097
in Boston at that period.

43:30.117 --> 43:32.641
Is this the research you've done or the books that you did?

43:32.661 --> 43:36.046
No, I did, yeah.

43:36.106 --> 43:38.129
So you spend a lot of time on these individual books.

43:38.329 --> 43:42.235
Well, maybe I haven't made it clear, that's why I'm here.

43:42.275 --> 43:56.517
I'm writing a book about my library where all these stories are told, and it's intended to be a kind of artifactual tour of American cultural and intellectual history.

43:56.868 --> 44:07.263
But in every case, it's tied to a specific book, specific signatures, annotations, inscriptions, sometimes deeply moving inscriptions.

44:07.464 --> 44:11.369
But you know, you've got this book to tell me how you would have gotten up on the night and put it someplace else.

44:11.550 --> 44:15.315
Well, I would have put it next to, say, The Willard Complete Body of Divinity.

44:15.886 --> 44:21.253
Because, in a sense, this is the secret world of the Puritans, and the other is the official world.

44:22.014 --> 44:29.463
And it would be nice to confront... So it would have gone with... What book would you... Well, the Edwards book that I just described.

44:31.786 --> 44:37.894
When I talk about historical witness, take a book like John Adams' Defense of the Constitutions.

44:37.954 --> 44:40.577
This is a defense of the state constitutions.

44:40.861 --> 44:46.909
that came out in 87 in Philadelphia in order to influence the debates over the federal constitution.

44:46.929 --> 44:47.710
The debate again is what?

44:47.730 --> 44:48.111
87.

44:48.652 --> 44:50.354
I just want to see the book play.

44:50.414 --> 44:52.216
This isn't the one from the Old South Church.

44:52.317 --> 44:55.441
No, this is Talleyrand's book play.

44:55.481 --> 44:55.861
Oh, okay.

44:56.102 --> 45:02.170
And this he used, and he talks about using it in the writing of the French Constitution of 1790.

45:02.310 --> 45:03.532
Talleyrand talks about it?

45:03.552 --> 45:04.193
Yeah.

45:04.213 --> 45:05.655
Talleyrand used this.

45:06.115 --> 45:08.098
So we have multiple associations here.

45:08.118 --> 45:08.218
Yeah.

45:08.823 --> 45:16.613
He bought it from this bookstore in Paris, Barbois.

45:17.694 --> 45:18.856
They were also a printer.

45:19.036 --> 45:23.401
They printed the French edition of Jefferson's Notes on the State of Virginia.

45:24.483 --> 45:32.913
This is a book about American Constitution writing, used in the writing of the French Constitution.

45:33.013 --> 45:36.838
Where did you get that book?

45:40.936 --> 45:42.598
I'm a dealer.

45:42.879 --> 45:44.381
I don't have a mark on it.

45:44.401 --> 45:45.983
Are you spending a lot of money for these books?

45:48.788 --> 45:51.071
Well, no.

45:52.613 --> 46:10.099
Whenever I can, because I've collected for 30 years, the books I have appreciated significantly so that I can trade a book that I bought at X amount of money for a book that now is three times X.

46:10.282 --> 46:25.176
I'm very, just sort of off the record, I'm very anxious about IRS because I do, and every serious collector does, deals in books, sells books in order to buy new books.

46:25.957 --> 46:38.449
So I'm involved in that, but no dealer can really go on the record as doing that because it's sort of an underground economy.

46:39.458 --> 46:55.396
I use, my books are my bank account, and I use them, I spend them to get what I see to be even more compelling books.

46:55.416 --> 47:01.663
Well, so even if it's a very... Well, I try not to sell association or trade association copies.

47:03.485 --> 47:04.486
So I'm always nibbling up.

47:04.506 --> 47:05.487
So these books aren't forever then?

47:05.607 --> 47:07.930
Well, no, there are books that will, you know,

47:08.197 --> 47:10.019
The books I'm showing you will never leave.

47:10.159 --> 47:14.183
There are some that are marginal in those 500 books.

47:14.403 --> 47:25.333
I had to sell 23 books to buy the Jonathan Edwards copy of Willard, but it was so extraordinary.

47:25.353 --> 47:26.914
It is a self-sustaining collection.

47:27.135 --> 47:35.082
Yeah, it feeds on itself, but in order to become even more extraordinary.

47:35.332 --> 47:36.814
Now, do you have a name for your collection?

47:38.756 --> 47:44.742
Well, for the purposes of the... I thought I cataloged.

47:44.762 --> 47:45.503
You have a catalog.

47:45.944 --> 47:49.988
Yeah, well, it's out of date, but I do have a catalog.

47:50.008 --> 47:52.451
Is this something that I can use for a copy of this?

47:52.491 --> 47:53.552
Yeah, I can give you a copy.

47:53.572 --> 47:54.373
Pretty quickly, too?

47:54.914 --> 47:56.375
Yeah, I can give it to you today.

47:57.216 --> 47:57.897
Do you have a...

47:58.265 --> 48:04.252
CV that I can have, too, and I have to go through all the whole background of your... Well, when we go, I can print it out at home.

48:04.312 --> 48:05.674
I don't have it.

48:08.738 --> 48:13.563
But let me tell you two other kinds of books that I have.

48:15.286 --> 48:19.651
Sometimes, very rarely, I'm interested in an anonymous owner.

48:20.131 --> 48:23.175
But the anonymous owner has to be really extraordinary.

48:24.134 --> 48:28.279
You're probably familiar with Mary Rowlandson's captivity narrative.

48:28.720 --> 48:30.021
It came out in 1675.

48:30.321 --> 48:39.993
The book was reprinted over and over again.

48:40.053 --> 48:44.278
This is a copy from 1794.

48:44.398 --> 48:49.344
This is a copy of an account by a woman of being captured by the Indians.

48:51.006 --> 48:54.090
What's extraordinary about it is the binding.

48:55.167 --> 48:55.708
The binding.

48:55.988 --> 49:02.937
The binding, from all the research I've done, is a hand-painted mohawk binding.

49:02.957 --> 49:10.908
In other words, this was owned by a Native American at the end of the 18th or the beginning of the 19th century.

49:11.609 --> 49:13.972
Now, where would a Native American get this?

49:15.193 --> 49:17.276
And tell me this, how do you describe the size of this?

49:17.957 --> 49:20.841
This, it's a duodecimal.

49:20.861 --> 49:24.786
Um... I...

49:25.053 --> 49:37.286
I've identified this pattern as a Mohawk pattern, and I've got people working here now, people who deal with early Native American arts, to see if there's a text here.

49:37.306 --> 49:41.470
In other words, this is merely decorative, or does it make some kind of statement?

49:42.591 --> 49:52.782
What probably happened is that this was a Native American who was in what's called a praying Indian in a Christian mission, who was being taught to read

49:53.116 --> 49:55.999
by the use of these relatively simple small books.

49:56.500 --> 50:05.849
But imagine the situation of the Indian who is being taught to, in a sense, see his own culture as evil.

50:06.870 --> 50:16.200
And it alienates him from his cultural world in order to bring him into the world of Christianity.

50:16.600 --> 50:22.026
And in a sense, he's taking his world back by marking it as a Native American artifact.

50:23.120 --> 50:27.446
So there the reading situation that I'm imagining is very powerful.

50:28.628 --> 50:38.361
What's going through the mind of a Native American who's being taught to read English with this account of the brutality of Native Americans?

50:38.381 --> 50:43.308
Or in this case, this is something I'm working on right now.

50:43.348 --> 50:45.771
The O.J.

50:45.791 --> 50:50.798
Simpson trial of the 19th century was the... Do that again.

50:51.318 --> 50:52.320
The O.J.

50:52.360 --> 51:04.999
Simpson trial of the 19th century was this trial of John Webster for the murder of George Parkman.

51:05.800 --> 51:07.022
They were both at Harvard.

51:08.304 --> 51:13.792
Webster owed money to Parkman.

51:15.275 --> 51:20.042
Eventually, Parkman's body was found in

51:21.895 --> 51:24.880
in the refuge of a furnace.

51:26.503 --> 51:33.836
I'm sorry, the author of the George Who, what's his name?

51:33.896 --> 51:36.420
Bemis, B-E-M-I-S.

51:36.440 --> 51:36.681
B-E-M-I-S.

51:36.701 --> 51:36.801
Okay.

51:37.562 --> 51:42.651
So anyway, this exposed Harvard to the kind of publicity they didn't want.

51:42.771 --> 51:46.738
One Harvard professor killing this other Harvard researcher.

51:47.022 --> 51:54.675
It was this massive trial that went on for months, and finally Webster was convicted, even though he said the janitor did it.

51:55.076 --> 52:01.807
The janitor was making the money on the side by supplying bodies for anatomy classes.

52:02.468 --> 52:03.410
When was this?

52:03.570 --> 52:09.020
The murder was November 1849, in the trial 1850.

52:11.203 --> 52:12.726
The main witness...

52:13.178 --> 52:22.410
was the chief medical officer who identified these bones as being partners, which was pretty hard to do, right?

52:22.430 --> 52:22.831
In 1850.

52:23.512 --> 52:27.818
Well, what this is... So anyway, let me just give you one more setup before I open the book.

52:28.959 --> 52:32.224
So the guy's hanged, and there's this... He's hanged.

52:32.244 --> 52:33.145
Yeah, he's hanged.

52:33.165 --> 52:42.898
There's this outcry that not only has the verdict against this Harvard professor been excessive,

52:43.267 --> 52:49.033
but that the defense really didn't make much of a case in the prosecution over-prosecuted.

52:50.135 --> 52:52.918
Most people didn't, many, many people didn't believe he did it.

52:53.338 --> 52:59.084
Well, this copy is owned by Winslow Lewis.

52:59.485 --> 53:04.871
This is the official account that the prosecutor wrote, basically defending his case.

53:05.471 --> 53:07.474
Bemis was the prosecutor.

53:08.715 --> 53:12.379
And this is...

53:12.916 --> 53:15.861
Webster, the murderer.

53:16.421 --> 53:16.942
That's him.

53:16.962 --> 53:19.146
And this is Parkman, the murderer.

53:20.608 --> 53:31.464
And what this book is, is a copy of the official transcript of the trial owned by the chief medical officer, Winslow Lewis.

53:31.665 --> 53:39.717
And Winslow Lewis has not only gotten everybody in the trial to sign a piece of paper, including

53:39.950 --> 53:43.153
Ephraim Littlefield, who was the janitor who might have done it.

53:43.774 --> 53:47.237
But the murder took place between 1 and 5 p.m.

53:48.798 --> 53:52.462
on Friday, the 23rd of November, 1849.

53:54.323 --> 54:02.291
And what is pasted onto the front here is a, this is an appointment slip in Webster's hand.

54:02.731 --> 54:08.016
It matches the signature in there and matches all these signatures I've looked at.

54:08.485 --> 54:15.513
for an appointment at about half past three on the day of the murder, when the murder was known to take place between one and five.

54:15.953 --> 54:18.096
He's trying to set up his alibi here.

54:18.116 --> 54:35.775
Well, this was never introduced in the case, that this is a potentially exculpatory piece of evidence that never made it into trial, but appears in the chief medical officer's copy, who has almost sort of pasted it as a kind of trophy.

54:36.276 --> 54:38.458
And it's unknown to scholars...

54:38.810 --> 54:39.972
Yeah.

54:40.192 --> 54:43.458
Simon Shaman, Harvard, has written a book about this murder case.

54:43.898 --> 54:44.700
Has he?

54:44.760 --> 54:47.084
Yeah, called Dead Certains.

54:47.384 --> 54:48.686
Oh, I know that book.

54:48.706 --> 54:50.489
I haven't read it, but I know the book.

54:50.509 --> 54:54.196
That's about this murder case, and he's never seen this.

54:54.216 --> 55:00.065
So this is potentially a volatile piece of information.

55:00.526 --> 55:03.331
And there's now another book being written by a woman.

55:03.371 --> 55:05.374
I'm meeting her in Boston on Saturdays.

55:05.911 --> 55:12.037
Because this book not only has that, but it has the medical officer's annotations about the trial.

55:13.118 --> 55:15.761
This is quite a significant artifact.

55:15.781 --> 55:20.186
Yeah, this might open up the most important... Do you think Shama has it right or wrong?

55:20.386 --> 55:27.874
I don't mean that for you to... This is a book you certainly should have known.

55:28.294 --> 55:30.096
Well, this was in...

55:30.278 --> 55:32.561
This was not in a public repository.

55:32.642 --> 55:34.644
I just got this book, and it's unknown.

55:34.765 --> 55:40.794
But what I'm saying is, there's no way you knew he was writing about the trial either, but I should think it would have been something.

55:41.234 --> 55:44.259
Oh, yeah, he would have loved to have seen, of course.

55:45.420 --> 55:47.243
It's too late for his book.

55:47.684 --> 55:53.232
So each of these books has some sort of, stands as a kind of witness to

55:53.701 --> 55:55.664
to something or it sheds light.

55:56.785 --> 55:58.888
So, let me just finish on that.

55:59.228 --> 56:01.571
Are you able to draw any conclusions based on this?

56:01.752 --> 56:09.762
Well, it's more intriguing than it is utterly convincing.

56:09.802 --> 56:12.726
I'm going to talk to this woman who's now writing a new book.

56:12.806 --> 56:14.328
She knows a lot more than I do.

56:15.089 --> 56:21.598
The actual transcript of the trial is at Mass Historical Society, so I will use their

56:21.899 --> 56:26.264
material and see if this new piece of evidence.

56:26.704 --> 56:49.088
So I see myself as sort of rescuing these books and bringing them together into a whole that I'll probably leave to Stanford University that represents books from really the libraries of most significant Americans, from

56:50.013 --> 57:06.616
the 1650s to the 1850s, and all of them books that I will tell stories about, stories that are, as you say, triangulated by external evidence of letters or diary entries or annotations in the book.

57:06.636 --> 57:18.653
For instance, this is a book from Melville's library, an important book, a book of 18th century philosophy in the 19th century of Bridgman.

57:18.920 --> 57:20.022
And this is a gift book.

57:21.404 --> 57:23.147
Richard Lathers was a friend of his.

57:23.328 --> 57:24.249
He was a southerner.

57:24.350 --> 57:26.193
L-A-T-H-E-R-S.

57:26.654 --> 57:35.650
And Lathers sold his slaves, moved to Long Island, set up this enormous mansion in Long Island with a large library that Melville used to visit.

57:36.351 --> 57:39.737
Can I describe from Lathers to Melville?

57:39.757 --> 57:41.360
No, no, from Melville to Lathers.

57:43.584 --> 57:43.864
All right, no.

57:44.401 --> 57:46.703
So Melville gave this to Lavin.

57:46.723 --> 57:46.964
Right.

57:47.024 --> 57:49.126
This is Melville's signature.

57:49.146 --> 57:50.707
That's quite wonderful, isn't it?

57:50.727 --> 57:53.050
Melville... 1853.

57:54.371 --> 57:59.456
In 1853... Moby Dick is only a year or so old.

57:59.596 --> 58:03.721
Well, but the problem is that Pierre had bombed.

58:04.021 --> 58:05.222
Nobody's reading Moby Dick?

58:05.282 --> 58:09.126
Nobody's reading Moby Dick, so he decides he's going to write magazine fiction.

58:09.629 --> 58:14.416
of Benito Serino and Bartleby, et cetera, all began to be written at this point.

58:15.117 --> 58:27.676
And Lathers had given him a copy of Washington Irving's stories to encourage him to do magazine work, to be paid by the page for piece work.

58:28.257 --> 58:30.501
And this was the reciprocating gift.

58:30.581 --> 58:32.143
I just want to write down the description.

58:32.363 --> 58:32.484
Yeah.

58:32.504 --> 58:33.365
Go ahead.

58:33.846 --> 58:36.109
Let's just go to that description.

58:36.258 --> 58:37.119
You can keep talking.

58:37.139 --> 58:40.763
All right, so Richard Lathers, Esquire from his friend Herman Melville.

58:41.363 --> 58:48.831
But Melville had read this book before he gave it to Lathers, and it has some of his marginalia in Melville's hand.

58:49.952 --> 58:55.318
And what's interesting is that the marginalia... This is Melville's hand right here.

58:55.618 --> 58:57.039
It's quite different from this or this.

58:57.960 --> 58:59.442
Melville... Is this pencil for you?

58:59.562 --> 59:00.943
Yeah, that's pencil, yeah.

59:00.963 --> 59:01.624
This is pencil.

59:03.747 --> 59:07.932
Two previous people had read this book before Melville bought it.

59:07.952 --> 59:11.577
He bought it as a used book.

59:11.597 --> 59:21.789
And here, the passage here is about Stern, Lauren Stern, you know, the sentimental journey, Tristram Shandy.

59:23.211 --> 59:30.200
And it says, Stern, to acknowledge with Stern as the truest philosophy that there is not so much difference between good and evil.

59:30.460 --> 59:31.501
You're reading from the text.

59:31.541 --> 59:32.202
From the text.

59:32.603 --> 59:34.787
as the world are apt to imagine.

59:36.970 --> 59:45.724
This is sort of a position you might think Melville would be attracted to, who obviously sees good and evil as not exactly opposite one another.

59:46.526 --> 59:51.454
But an early reader had said, a very unphilosophical critic, certainly.

59:51.914 --> 59:59.607
In other words, this reader is disagreeing with Stern's too easy formulation, that good and evil are closer...

59:59.789 --> 01:00:06.219
And then Melville, responding to the previous person's marginalia, says, yes, slightly asinine.

01:00:07.682 --> 01:00:09.444
What's he saying up here, right next to the book?

01:00:09.545 --> 01:00:10.646
Well, this is not Melville.

01:00:10.666 --> 01:00:18.419
This is a previous owner, and you can see that it was rebound subsequently to that.

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:26.371
So this is a book about whether or not the world is beneficent and whether it's made for man's benefit.

01:00:26.411 --> 01:00:26.792
It's a podcast.

01:00:27.093 --> 01:00:33.880
It's a popular book, Seeing God as Benevolent, and Nature as Being His Revelation.

01:00:34.241 --> 01:00:39.066
And this is precisely the sort of philosophy that Melville wanted to embrace but couldn't intellectually.

01:00:40.387 --> 01:00:54.182
And it's interesting that he chose to give this as a gift, because in Pierre, the novel he had just finished before reading this book, the main character is given a copy of this book.

01:00:54.202 --> 01:00:54.602
Really?

01:00:55.072 --> 01:00:56.213
This very same book.

01:00:56.273 --> 01:00:57.374
This very same book.

01:00:57.514 --> 01:01:01.578
So you save the kicker for the last.

01:01:02.178 --> 01:01:10.526
And refuses to accept it because he's given up on these sort of sophomoric views of God's goodness.

01:01:12.007 --> 01:01:13.588
And so it's a very powerful book.

01:01:13.688 --> 01:01:24.538
It's almost as if Melville is giving it from his library, not because he subscribes to it so much as he's trying to distance himself from it, get away from the book.

01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:31.276
So it gives me the occasion to speculate on Melville's motives for giving it, look at his annotations.

01:01:31.377 --> 01:01:39.265
This book is just a great treasure at that key period in his history.

01:01:39.285 --> 01:01:40.526
And so here at AAS?

01:01:41.166 --> 01:01:41.967
What am I doing here?

01:01:42.688 --> 01:01:52.618
Well, I'm looking at other annotated and inscribed books, sometimes by the same people, because sometimes it matters the form of the inscriptions.

01:01:52.953 --> 01:01:57.077
For instance, I'm a book by Margaret Fuller, the early feminist.

01:01:57.838 --> 01:01:59.240
She had two loves in her life.

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:05.407
One was a woman, Anna Barker, and one was a man, Sam Ward.

01:02:05.527 --> 01:02:08.130
She waxes rhapsodic about these two.

01:02:08.210 --> 01:02:10.212
She's crazy about Emerson, too.

01:02:10.612 --> 01:02:10.852
What?

01:02:11.233 --> 01:02:13.055
Wasn't she crazy about Emerson, too?

01:02:13.595 --> 01:02:16.899
Well, yeah, though he kept her at a great distance.

01:02:16.979 --> 01:02:20.563
But she had these big fantasy lives about these two.

01:02:20.932 --> 01:02:31.247
She was self-conscious that her letters would be read as excessively sensual, but when she talks about Anna Barker, it's incredible.

01:02:31.808 --> 01:02:37.396
She says, this electricity moves through my body whenever I'm next to her, et cetera, et cetera.

01:02:37.416 --> 01:02:40.500
Well, then the horrible day of her life comes.

01:02:41.301 --> 01:02:50.314
Anna Barker, one love, and this sexy son of a Boston banker, Sam Ward, marry each other.

01:02:51.273 --> 01:03:04.448
So, poor Mother Fuller.

01:03:05.169 --> 01:03:12.758
Anyway, she then goes on and writes a book, and she feels she has to give a copy to Sam and Anna.

01:03:13.396 --> 01:03:18.342
But she does it, she only initials it, even though she's very close to both of them.

01:03:18.362 --> 01:03:23.208
It's as if she doesn't want to, you know, this is a traumatic connection.

01:03:23.228 --> 01:03:27.613
So she makes herself disappear into her initials.

01:03:28.033 --> 01:03:30.216
She's there but not there.

01:03:30.236 --> 01:03:32.519
Was this, you think, a carnal relationship with both?

01:03:33.099 --> 01:03:40.568
No, I think it was a psychological relationship with both, but it had a physical impact on her in the way that reading...

01:03:41.003 --> 01:03:42.986
you know, erotic literature.

01:03:43.046 --> 01:03:46.610
You don't need to have the physical body there.

01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:54.921
But there are other books that I've seen to friends who are much less close in which she calls herself Sarah.

01:03:56.323 --> 01:04:00.729
But here it's the S. It's Sarah Margaret Fuller is her full name.

01:04:01.550 --> 01:04:05.475
So you can, for me, this is kind of the quintessential example where

01:04:05.962 --> 01:04:12.529
I'm trying to feel what she's feeling at the moment that she's giving this book in these charged circumstances.

01:04:13.810 --> 01:04:21.478
The book I end with, at the end of this book that I'm writing, well... So you're pretty well along then, aren't you?

01:04:21.498 --> 01:04:22.279
Well, somewhat.

01:04:22.299 --> 01:04:24.361
I've been collecting, so the stories exist.

01:04:25.562 --> 01:04:30.307
I can't get away without showing you what most people consider the best book in my collection.

01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:34.551
Let me show them to you first.

01:04:34.919 --> 01:04:37.602
Let me tell you the story of this.

01:04:37.622 --> 01:04:43.689
Frederick Douglass escapes from the Baltimore docks.

01:04:44.610 --> 01:04:47.914
He becomes involved in the abolitionist cause, but he has a problem.

01:04:47.954 --> 01:04:57.885
And his problem is that whenever it's announced that he's speaking somewhere, he's susceptible to recapture under the fugitive slave law.

01:04:57.905 --> 01:05:00.949
And he's married, and he's worried about his wife as well as himself.

01:05:02.090 --> 01:05:04.032
So he has a certain number of options.

01:05:04.366 --> 01:05:09.293
One option is to purchase his legal freedom, because there was a price on his head.

01:05:09.313 --> 01:05:10.555
Purchase his manumission.

01:05:10.976 --> 01:05:17.325
But people like Garrison said to him, well, if you do that, you're conceiving the philosophical principle of ownership.

01:05:17.345 --> 01:05:18.587
Easy for Garrison.

01:05:18.607 --> 01:05:19.949
Right, exactly.

01:05:19.969 --> 01:05:20.871
Easy for Garrison.

01:05:20.911 --> 01:05:23.475
The philosophical principle of ownership of human property.

01:05:24.096 --> 01:05:25.918
Well, but Douglas had a great comeback.

01:05:25.938 --> 01:05:27.340
He said, well, that's your metaphor.

01:05:27.421 --> 01:05:28.382
My metaphor...

01:05:28.818 --> 01:05:38.553
is that slavery is a form of kidnapping and I'd be paying a ransom, which is quite different than purchasing myself as a commodity.

01:05:39.535 --> 01:05:48.409
But what he does to escape the jeopardy of the fugitive slave law is to go on a speaking tour in Ireland and England.

01:05:48.429 --> 01:05:53.357
And he gets to Newcastle upon Tyne, a small Quaker meeting room.

01:05:54.434 --> 01:06:02.066
And there's a woman there, Ellen Richardson, who's about 28 years old, which is sort of an old maid for the time.

01:06:02.086 --> 01:06:03.909
And she'd never seen anybody like this.

01:06:03.929 --> 01:06:15.508
This charismatic, extraordinarily handsome black man telling the story of his life and telling the story of his jeopardy under the fugitive slave law.

01:06:15.528 --> 01:06:21.117
So she walks up to him and says, well, you know, I could purchase your freedom for you.

01:06:21.603 --> 01:06:22.784
I'd raise the money.

01:06:22.864 --> 01:06:27.210
My brother, as a male, would do the correspondence to your slave owner.

01:06:28.211 --> 01:06:30.714
She, in fact, purchases his legal freedom.

01:06:31.675 --> 01:06:35.579
This was her way of getting herself into his life.

01:06:35.639 --> 01:06:37.902
In fact, they have a lifelong correspondence.

01:06:38.102 --> 01:06:39.864
Her name once again?

01:06:39.884 --> 01:06:41.186
Ellen Richardson.

01:06:41.286 --> 01:06:46.412
There are people who think he had an affair with her.

01:06:47.692 --> 01:06:54.021
The tour was occasioned by the first volume of his autobiography, Mary of My Life as a Slave.

01:06:54.581 --> 01:07:02.011
But then he rewrote his, in a much longer form, in 1855, his autobiography called My Bondage, My Freedom.

01:07:02.051 --> 01:07:05.816
And it's a sort of ironic title because the freedom isn't much different from the bond either.

01:07:06.557 --> 01:07:12.766
And one of the centerpieces of this is his account of meeting Ellen Richardson and her purchasing his freedom.

01:07:12.786 --> 01:07:13.767
That's 55.

01:07:14.236 --> 01:07:24.386
59, he's indicted as a co-conspirator with John Brown, with whom he had some connection, but he was not part of this conspiracy, you know, the Harper's Ferry.

01:07:25.207 --> 01:07:27.028
But now he has to flee from the North.

01:07:27.068 --> 01:07:28.029
He flees to Canada.

01:07:28.330 --> 01:07:29.851
His marriage has fallen apart.

01:07:30.532 --> 01:07:32.073
He has relatively little money.

01:07:32.694 --> 01:07:37.118
He's pretty confident that Lincoln is going to lose the election of 1860.

01:07:37.679 --> 01:07:38.259
Where to go?

01:07:38.299 --> 01:07:44.125
He decides to go across the Atlantic and see Ellen Richardson again

01:07:44.712 --> 01:08:02.039
And with him, he was going to take across the Atlantic, or did take with him across the My Bondage, My Freedom, which tells about her purchasing his freedom with this inscription.

01:08:02.339 --> 01:08:03.801
So why don't you read it for me?

01:08:03.821 --> 01:08:05.163
To Miss Ellen Richardson.

01:08:05.183 --> 01:08:06.065
Do it slowly, okay.

01:08:06.085 --> 01:08:07.807
To Miss Ellen Richardson.

01:08:08.028 --> 01:08:09.951
Ellen Richardson, underline twice.

01:08:09.971 --> 01:08:12.795
Underline twice, with the respect... Comma.

01:08:13.231 --> 01:08:18.417
esteem and most grateful regards of the author.

01:08:18.437 --> 01:08:19.358
Author's underline.

01:08:19.378 --> 01:08:20.840
Underline, which connects them.

01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:22.382
They both have the double underlining.

01:08:22.843 --> 01:08:40.864
And it's in the third person because of the pride of his authorship as a black author and as a token of his sentiments toward her as the friend and benefactress through whose active benevolence he was, the key verb, ransomed from American slavery.

01:08:40.884 --> 01:08:42.206
Wow.

01:08:42.226 --> 01:08:43.187
Jesus Christ.

01:08:44.348 --> 01:08:46.571
Let me hold this one.

01:08:46.591 --> 01:08:47.853
That's a hot book.

01:08:49.195 --> 01:08:50.156
And where did you go?

01:08:50.176 --> 01:08:52.039
Well, this is an amazing story.

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:55.203
Each of these books has a story.

01:08:55.263 --> 01:08:58.788
Yeah, I mean, wow, a hand, fist.

01:08:59.569 --> 01:09:00.851
But take a look at this.

01:09:00.911 --> 01:09:01.792
This knocks me out.

01:09:01.812 --> 01:09:04.877
Well, but I got another volume that goes with it.

01:09:05.137 --> 01:09:10.845
When they first went to hear him speak in 1846, this is the copy of the first

01:09:11.247 --> 01:09:41.254
version of his autobiography this is the mother Sarah Richardson and here this is this they actually had with them it was a Dublin edition when they heard him speak this is the first version of the autobiography narrative of the life of Frederick Douglass an American slave written by himself Dublin 1846 came out in 1845 yeah and then this is when they meet

01:09:41.605 --> 01:09:45.189
And she proposes that she purchase his freedom.

01:09:45.229 --> 01:09:45.750
She does.

01:09:45.810 --> 01:09:48.713
This is the account of it, and this is what he brings back with her.

01:09:49.193 --> 01:09:51.696
She's given him his life in law.

01:09:52.537 --> 01:09:54.780
He gives her his life in letters.

01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:55.981
And she has signed her name.

01:09:56.001 --> 01:09:56.982
Well, this is the mother.

01:09:57.042 --> 01:10:00.506
The mother and daughter came to hear them.

01:10:01.087 --> 01:10:02.668
The mother, actually, and two sisters.

01:10:02.708 --> 01:10:04.751
And this is what they brought when they first went.

01:10:04.991 --> 01:10:06.853
So these were both in the family.

01:10:08.082 --> 01:10:10.044
And the Richardson family.

01:10:10.104 --> 01:10:10.905
And the Richardson family.

01:10:10.965 --> 01:10:12.587
And you acquired them from the Richardson family?

01:10:12.687 --> 01:10:14.029
No, it's unbelievable.

01:10:14.149 --> 01:10:36.334
Somehow they ended up, you know, you hear these stories about Paris bookstalls all the time, but they ended up in a Paris bookstall and they were purchased in the 1930s by a professor at the University of Paris who was a communist and identified with Douglas.

01:10:36.702 --> 01:10:46.293
And he sent it to an American friend of his with an inscription saying, in memory of an earlier leftist movement or something like that.

01:10:47.114 --> 01:10:58.286
And this friend not only really didn't know who, he sort of knew who Frederick Douglass was, but he hadn't even noticed that this was signed and he had no idea what the story was.

01:10:59.007 --> 01:11:06.355
So I'm at this guy's house for dinner and I see this 19th century American binding, mid-19th century.

01:11:07.077 --> 01:11:09.220
It just blows me away.

01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:10.642
I can't believe what I'm seeing.

01:11:10.982 --> 01:11:14.307
So, stupidly, I tell them the whole story that I just told you.

01:11:14.327 --> 01:11:18.233
This is, of course, the last thing I should have done.

01:11:19.835 --> 01:11:23.440
And I'm a young assistant professor.

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:25.723
I'm making like $16,000 a year.

01:11:26.604 --> 01:11:27.465
What is this?

01:11:27.606 --> 01:11:29.068
1978 or not.

01:11:30.289 --> 01:11:32.212
How old are you, by the way?

01:11:32.232 --> 01:11:32.713
I'm 49.

01:11:33.694 --> 01:11:36.578
And so I offer them $1,000.

01:11:36.794 --> 01:11:39.217
which, of course, I didn't have, but I'd get $1,000 for it.

01:11:39.857 --> 01:11:43.061
He said, no, I can't sell it.

01:11:43.081 --> 01:11:44.463
So I said, can I borrow it?

01:11:44.823 --> 01:11:48.347
Because I teach Frederick Douglass all the time, and this blows students away.

01:11:48.847 --> 01:11:53.172
Well, again, it's the presence of the past.

01:11:53.312 --> 01:11:54.954
It's right there in the hand.

01:11:56.736 --> 01:12:02.342
Beginning in about the 1830s, when facsimile signatures could be easily reproduced.

01:12:02.362 --> 01:12:05.586
They didn't have to be done on woodcuts.

01:12:05.903 --> 01:12:13.952
This notion that the signature was revelatory of the personality created this vogue of collecting signatures.

01:12:14.012 --> 01:12:22.502
You take a Washington letter, you cut the signature off, throw the letter away because there was something powerful about the signature.

01:12:22.562 --> 01:12:24.744
The signature in some way was the man.

01:12:26.586 --> 01:12:29.970
Paul has a series of essays on the signatures of famous men.

01:12:30.457 --> 01:12:35.463
which he reproduces the signature in facsimile and then describes it.

01:12:35.483 --> 01:12:42.010
So there's something still about seeing signatures as a sort of double for the person.

01:12:42.030 --> 01:12:44.113
Anyway, so for years I borrowed this book.

01:12:44.153 --> 01:12:47.657
I finally... And where was this?

01:12:47.977 --> 01:12:50.160
This was a retired Stanford professor.

01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:52.162
So you were out in California?

01:12:52.182 --> 01:12:56.266
Yes, in Palo Alto, California.

01:12:57.688 --> 01:12:58.489
So...

01:12:59.279 --> 01:13:01.842
So he's an older guy.

01:13:02.062 --> 01:13:04.505
I'm like 31 at the time.

01:13:04.525 --> 01:13:05.646
He's like 60.

01:13:06.787 --> 01:13:12.454
You're desperate for this.

01:13:12.474 --> 01:13:13.935
I can't sleep at night.

01:13:14.276 --> 01:13:23.386
I can't sleep at night to know that this is out there and that I alone know that it's out there and that this guy doesn't care about it except that he now knows it's valuable.

01:13:25.288 --> 01:13:28.712
So what happens is three years later

01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:29.891
He dies.

01:13:29.911 --> 01:13:31.192
He gets divorced.

01:13:31.212 --> 01:13:32.153
He gets divorced.

01:13:32.173 --> 01:13:34.875
And then I said, oh, I'm not going to miss it.

01:13:34.895 --> 01:13:36.797
I miss this opportunity.

01:13:36.817 --> 01:13:37.898
What if she takes the guy?

01:13:38.178 --> 01:13:46.926
Well, you know, it's important to us, but the wider world is not always moved by Frederick Douglass, or even knows who the hell he is.

01:13:47.847 --> 01:13:50.549
So I come in for the kill, and I offer $3,000.

01:13:50.710 --> 01:13:53.412
And he sells it to me.

01:13:53.692 --> 01:13:59.037
And off the record, because I don't want to talk about prices, I just turned down $110.

01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:02.167
Well, that was a dealer.

01:14:03.249 --> 01:14:08.482
I won't use prices, by the way.

01:14:08.682 --> 01:14:10.086
Don't worry about it.

01:14:10.146 --> 01:14:13.955
That's not of great interest to me.

01:14:14.055 --> 01:14:17.363
People want to tell me I'm interested in knowing.

01:14:17.630 --> 01:14:20.073
I want to know if you can afford to collect.

01:14:20.093 --> 01:14:21.855
That's what I'm interested in.

01:14:21.875 --> 01:14:22.596
Finish the story.

01:14:23.317 --> 01:14:26.000
So I got the book from him.

01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:27.322
And this was in the 70s?

01:14:27.362 --> 01:14:27.963
Yeah.

01:14:28.023 --> 01:14:28.844
Maybe 81 or so.

01:14:28.884 --> 01:14:30.306
Yeah, late 70s, yeah.

01:14:30.326 --> 01:14:32.028
He's still alive, this guy?

01:14:32.248 --> 01:14:33.149
Believe it or not, is.

01:14:33.509 --> 01:14:34.611
Does he ever mention this?

01:14:34.751 --> 01:14:37.755
He's been retired so long, I haven't seen him in years.

01:14:38.636 --> 01:14:41.039
And we don't really know how... Oh, he got it from... He got it.

01:14:41.199 --> 01:14:44.303
So we don't know what happened to the book between 1855 and 1930.

01:14:44.683 --> 01:14:47.046
Thank God it didn't...

01:14:47.313 --> 01:14:47.934
disappear.

01:14:48.875 --> 01:14:49.816
Yeah, easily.

01:14:50.137 --> 01:15:04.895
Well, that's what I see myself as, you know, these survivals that I'm trying to document and keep together and ultimately bring together for a library that have all kinds of intellectual relationships to one another.

01:15:04.935 --> 01:15:10.002
I'll have a book from Melville's library and then a copy of a Melville book.

01:15:10.062 --> 01:15:12.064
Let me tell you about this Hawthorne book that I just got.

01:15:12.084 --> 01:15:14.267
I'll give you one in the store before we do it.

01:15:14.287 --> 01:15:15.489
I'm just keeping very fast.

01:15:15.789 --> 01:15:16.510
No, go ahead.

01:15:16.895 --> 01:15:25.690
I just picked up an extraordinary book, The House of Seven Gagels, 1851, the same year as Moby-Day.

01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:31.119
Hawthorne's writing about old Salem, and he's haunted by old Salem.

01:15:31.219 --> 01:15:36.669
There's a sense, by the way, of these books as all kind of being haunted and haunting.

01:15:36.709 --> 01:15:38.151
They're so powerful, they're haunting.

01:15:39.133 --> 01:15:41.637
They internalize themselves in some way.

01:15:41.937 --> 01:15:44.460
Pardon me for sharing your enthusiasm.

01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:46.382
It's the same kind of... Yeah, well, we are.

01:15:46.462 --> 01:15:48.304
I go berserk myself.

01:15:48.324 --> 01:15:49.245
Well, that really blows me.

01:15:49.265 --> 01:15:52.789
Well, there's nothing like that out there.

01:15:53.189 --> 01:15:54.591
Well, I'll tell you another.

01:15:54.611 --> 01:16:02.240
I want to tell you this often, but I'll tell you another story that's even... So I thought, you know, here's this Jewish guy in golf.

01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:04.042
I shouldn't own this book.

01:16:04.682 --> 01:16:07.585
I'm beginning to feel guilty about owning this book.

01:16:07.606 --> 01:16:08.967
You're feeling guilty about owning this book?

01:16:08.987 --> 01:16:09.868
Yeah, about this book.

01:16:10.372 --> 01:16:13.976
Well, Charles Waxing would kill that.

01:16:14.196 --> 01:16:23.407
Well, no, but I said where the book really should be is Howard University.

01:16:23.427 --> 01:16:25.569
So I'm torn.

01:16:27.131 --> 01:16:31.135
Whether I should keep it or I should... Is that where Douglass' stuff is?

01:16:31.756 --> 01:16:37.162
Well, suffice it to say that the library is the Frederick Douglass Library.

01:16:38.344 --> 01:16:39.585
So I take it in there.

01:16:40.055 --> 01:16:58.452
because I'm having this real kind of crisis of conscience which I got over but I'm thinking either I'll sell it or give it to him so I show it to the special collections guy there and of course he almost drops dead and before I open my mouth he says we can't afford this but here's the name of

01:16:58.752 --> 01:17:02.416
somebody on our board of trustees who might be able to afford it.

01:17:02.436 --> 01:17:03.477
He didn't have no money.

01:17:03.497 --> 01:17:06.261
He thought you were trying to just sell it for money.

01:17:06.281 --> 01:17:10.766
Yeah, but I went in... In other words, this guy might be able to buy it for himself.

01:17:11.006 --> 01:17:15.611
Or buy it for us.

01:17:15.651 --> 01:17:19.716
But I wanted to talk to him about the book, and they've got the stock list stuff there.

01:17:20.497 --> 01:17:22.119
But of course, he wanted to buy it.

01:17:24.061 --> 01:17:24.441
He misread me.

01:17:24.541 --> 01:17:26.283
Yeah, he misread me.

01:17:26.303 --> 01:17:27.865
Because I was thinking of giving it to him.

01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:31.364
But then, here's the extraordinary moment.

01:17:31.704 --> 01:17:34.669
So I got these two books in my book bag.

01:17:35.470 --> 01:17:36.271
Did you get both of these?

01:17:36.611 --> 01:17:38.154
Yeah, they're together.

01:17:38.194 --> 01:17:39.435
Somebody put them together.

01:17:39.836 --> 01:17:41.318
Yeah, well, the family.

01:17:41.398 --> 01:17:43.221
Well, and they're volume one and volume two.

01:17:43.641 --> 01:17:45.123
This is the expanded version of this.

01:17:46.165 --> 01:17:56.299
So I'm leaving special collections, and they've got a security desk with this black undergraduate guy manning the desk.

01:17:56.887 --> 01:17:57.788
And here I am.

01:17:57.848 --> 01:17:59.730
I got my little corduroy suit on.

01:18:00.631 --> 01:18:03.795
And I'm all ready to open this.

01:18:03.875 --> 01:18:05.957
And I'm already thinking, what am I going to tell the guy?

01:18:06.037 --> 01:18:09.120
Because it looks like it's something they should have.

01:18:09.621 --> 01:18:12.624
I'm getting nervous about having to explain it as I leave.

01:18:14.186 --> 01:18:16.729
And I'm with another faculty member.

01:18:17.410 --> 01:18:18.231
He looks at us.

01:18:18.731 --> 01:18:21.734
He sees that we've got ties and jackets on.

01:18:21.754 --> 01:18:25.378
And he lowers his eyes and waves us without even looking into the back.

01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:26.860
Mistakes.

01:18:27.312 --> 01:18:40.426
Well, but this was the first time I'd really seen that sort of Southern black deference to white culture, where he would be nervous examining the bags of white professionals.

01:18:41.187 --> 01:18:42.888
I don't see that at Whitener.

01:18:42.929 --> 01:18:47.373
Well, you know, you don't see it at Whitener.

01:18:47.413 --> 01:18:50.837
They check all my Xerox copies regarding it, as well they should.

01:18:50.857 --> 01:18:51.598
I'm glad they do.

01:18:51.958 --> 01:18:53.920
I'm going to tell you one last story, and we'll go.

01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:55.682
This is the sort of book I am with.

01:18:59.206 --> 01:19:00.948
This is a real beat-up book.

01:19:01.909 --> 01:19:11.822
Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., who became the Supreme Court Justice, lived in the shadow of his famous father, Oliver Wendell Holmes.

01:19:11.842 --> 01:19:12.283
You just keep talking.

01:19:12.403 --> 01:19:14.245
I'm going to go in here and take some pictures.

01:19:14.265 --> 01:19:16.308
You want to take some water before I move that glass?

01:19:23.577 --> 01:19:26.040
So, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.,

01:19:26.813 --> 01:19:28.915
And one of his friends is Emerson's son.

01:19:28.975 --> 01:19:32.779
They have in common the fact that they have these famous parents.

01:19:33.941 --> 01:19:39.727
So Oliver Wendell Holmes goes to fight in the Civil War, and he's wounded.

01:19:40.007 --> 01:19:42.189
He's in a military hospital.

01:19:44.031 --> 01:19:56.685
And Edward Emerson brings him a copy of The Conduct of Life, one of his father's books, as a kind of text of Christian consolation or non-Christian consolation.

01:19:57.712 --> 01:20:02.800
And he hands it around to the other wounded soldiers, and they're reading it.

01:20:03.601 --> 01:20:06.105
And this is the copy that he had in the hospital.

01:20:06.966 --> 01:20:19.626
And what moves me about it is there are collectors whose fantasy is the pristine copy, exactly as it came out from the presses.

01:20:20.448 --> 01:20:22.491
And that's why condition matters so much.

01:20:23.532 --> 01:20:25.255
For me, it's the opposite.

01:20:25.775 --> 01:20:36.011
A book like this that's battered to death, in a sense, emotionally, I connect it with the wounded body of Holmes.

01:20:36.111 --> 01:20:37.373
This is a wounded book.

01:20:37.553 --> 01:20:39.135
The spine is partially off.

01:20:39.156 --> 01:20:42.260
You can look at the conduct of life.

01:20:42.521 --> 01:20:51.454
And there's something moving about this as, as I say, a sort of version of his own body surviving.

01:20:51.755 --> 01:20:53.858
That the book survives but battered.

01:20:54.293 --> 01:21:01.263
And it's battered because it was handed around in this hospital from homes to other people.

01:21:01.784 --> 01:21:10.556
And so I end it with the beginning of the Civil War and a kind of wounded book from a wounded owner.

01:21:10.576 --> 01:21:16.344
But anyway, that's some sense of the collection.

01:21:16.705 --> 01:21:19.028
There is no collection like this in the country.

01:21:19.549 --> 01:21:22.393
Nobody collects exclusively association items.

01:21:23.437 --> 01:21:39.095
People collect, you know, a single author and associations around that author, but nobody collects the history of reading, as it were, or significant books from American libraries and only association copies.

01:21:39.315 --> 01:21:45.322
And as uneffectually significant as these books are, they're printed books.

01:21:45.783 --> 01:21:50.608
We're not talking about manuscripts here, and yet they do... Well, but that's a great question.

01:21:51.162 --> 01:21:54.387
This has been a problem in the Library of Congress.

01:21:54.407 --> 01:21:55.850
It was a problem here.

01:21:57.012 --> 01:21:58.374
There's now a new category.

01:21:58.434 --> 01:22:04.364
There used to be books and manuscripts.

01:22:04.544 --> 01:22:13.779
Traditionally, there are two categories, books and manuscripts.

01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:17.946
But these now occupy a kind of third category.

01:22:18.736 --> 01:22:24.121
And that category has recently been called books with manuscript.

01:22:24.141 --> 01:22:27.944
And that includes annotations or signatures or inscriptions.

01:22:27.964 --> 01:22:36.032
And now libraries are beginning to catalog as AAS does, by provenance, by the owner, if there's a signature in it.

01:22:37.193 --> 01:22:39.335
But they don't transcribe annotations.

01:22:39.355 --> 01:22:44.419
So these books, you're right, exist in this sort of world between books and manuscripts.

01:22:45.620 --> 01:22:47.562
But they have a context apart from the

01:22:48.098 --> 01:22:53.044
Yes, the context is, and sometimes it's multiple.

01:22:53.365 --> 01:23:05.860
This book I showed you from the Bradstreet Library has signatures, I'm sorry, I didn't show it to you, the book from John Cotton's library owned by the first American biographer.

01:23:06.601 --> 01:23:17.194
It has signatures from almost every member of the Norton Library.

01:23:17.950 --> 01:23:34.187
lineage from the 1650s through Andrews Norton, who was a famous theologian at Harvard in the 1820s, on to Charles Eliot Norton, the end of the 18th century, on to Norton's up until 1830.

01:23:34.227 --> 01:23:45.358
In other words, almost every signature, there's a signature representing almost every generation from the 1650s to the 1930s, same family.

01:23:45.980 --> 01:24:02.934
So, that book now is about that family, and it's kept because it has all these family signatures, and these multiple experiences of reading the same book, and reading the book your father read, reading a book your great-grandfather read.

01:24:04.756 --> 01:24:10.701
So, let me get a little dry here, but... Listen, don't worry.

01:24:10.721 --> 01:24:15.565
Yeah, okay, and... Well, what...

01:24:16.034 --> 01:24:20.059
So I lead this kind of double life.

01:24:20.339 --> 01:24:21.520
I'm a scholar.

01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:23.402
I write books.

01:24:23.522 --> 01:24:24.323
I'm a teacher.

01:24:24.784 --> 01:24:32.593
Well, tell me about the teaching and how the books name some of the courses that you teach.

01:24:32.613 --> 01:24:37.518
Well, I teach pretty much everything up to the Civil War.

01:24:37.658 --> 01:24:41.463
My own interest is... No, I'm in the English department.

01:24:41.663 --> 01:24:43.645
But I do really American studies.

01:24:43.777 --> 01:24:47.721
This is really a kind of American Studies collection.

01:24:48.883 --> 01:24:57.512
And the books I've written are mostly books about American culture during the American Revolution, the sort of emergence of American culture.

01:24:58.673 --> 01:25:05.580
And when we're reading Jefferson, I have a book from Jefferson's library, we talk about that.

01:25:06.522 --> 01:25:09.705
Here's a book from Washington's library.

01:25:11.547 --> 01:25:12.568
It's actually...

01:25:14.928 --> 01:25:16.130
A son?

01:25:16.370 --> 01:25:19.894
To His Excellency General Washington.

01:25:19.914 --> 01:25:20.235
I see.

01:25:20.635 --> 01:25:21.857
Is this signed by Washington?

01:25:21.877 --> 01:25:28.605
No, but there's a letter... Because if it is, it's worth a lot of money.

01:25:28.726 --> 01:25:30.568
Well, I'll tell you what's fascinating about this.

01:25:30.628 --> 01:25:40.080
I got this thing from Reese, and Reese had entered it as, there is no indication that Washington ever received this book.

01:25:40.941 --> 01:25:44.766
So I go to the Washington papers that have been coming out for years and years,

01:25:45.843 --> 01:26:04.947
Two years ago, there's a new volume that covers 1784, and there's a letter presenting the book to Washington and a long letter back from Washington acknowledging the book, which has a chapter on Washington and one of the earliest European maps of America.

01:26:05.147 --> 01:26:10.213
This is America right after the revolution in 84, right after the...

01:26:10.649 --> 01:26:18.761
And Washington says how complimented he was by it, that his French is poor, but he made his way through it.

01:26:19.743 --> 01:26:25.451
But then what's really important is that this gift starts a relationship.

01:26:25.471 --> 01:26:37.770
When Shays' Rebellion took place in the wake of the Constitution, America was getting bad press in England and France.

01:26:38.543 --> 01:26:41.607
You know, this government may not last.

01:26:41.627 --> 01:26:42.889
It's on shifting sands.

01:26:43.529 --> 01:26:52.120
So Washington called this guy, who was a sort of professional writer, and he had been to America as a visitor, and that's what this book is about, his visit to America.

01:26:52.641 --> 01:26:58.569
And he says, write something about how America is completely in control of itself.

01:26:59.229 --> 01:27:03.555
So he became Washington's French PR man.

01:27:03.974 --> 01:27:06.919
and wrote at Washington's urging a number of things.

01:27:06.999 --> 01:27:09.463
And this is the book that began that relationship.

01:27:09.984 --> 01:27:15.492
And contrary to Reese, who said it was never... And of course, the difference in value is enormous.

01:27:16.073 --> 01:27:18.177
But how were you able to document this?

01:27:18.197 --> 01:27:27.872
Because in the Washington papers, the printed papers Washington, they're up to like volume 28 or something, they reproduce the letter...

01:27:28.561 --> 01:27:34.686
that accompanied this very book and the letter that Washington wrote back acknowledging the book.

01:27:34.706 --> 01:27:35.928
So this is your research on the book?

01:27:35.948 --> 01:27:37.469
This is my research, yeah.

01:27:37.489 --> 01:27:38.690
Is this something you did here?

01:27:39.191 --> 01:27:40.932
Yeah, I did here, yeah.

01:27:40.972 --> 01:27:42.293
Name me the fellowship that you have.

01:27:42.313 --> 01:27:43.374
Is it a fellowship?

01:27:43.594 --> 01:27:45.256
No, it's not a fellowship.

01:27:45.276 --> 01:27:46.377
It's a brand new thing.

01:27:47.738 --> 01:27:55.986
Fellowships, from the AAS point of view, when you accept, say, NEH felons, you're accepting people who apply.

01:27:56.266 --> 01:27:56.526
Right.

01:27:56.590 --> 01:27:58.892
So the pool was limited to those who put in.

01:27:59.813 --> 01:28:03.236
So they decided, we want to be able to choose a person.

01:28:03.296 --> 01:28:03.837
Good idea.

01:28:04.518 --> 01:28:15.288
So they got money from the Mellon Foundation to have an annual scholar-in-residence who would be called the Distinguished Mellon Scholar-in-Residence.

01:28:15.708 --> 01:28:20.173
And I am the inaugural Distinguished Mellon Scholar-in-Residence.

01:28:20.193 --> 01:28:21.574
Did they do a press release on that?

01:28:21.634 --> 01:28:22.395
They did.

01:28:22.415 --> 01:28:23.576
So I'm the first one.

01:28:23.616 --> 01:28:25.618
So they had the pick of everybody.

01:28:26.341 --> 01:28:33.772
And my position here is not just to write a book, but to sort of mentor younger colleagues.

01:28:33.792 --> 01:28:35.614
So this is not like a sabbatical for you?

01:28:36.816 --> 01:28:38.078
Well, no, I'm writing.

01:28:38.318 --> 01:28:41.283
And I have some responsibility, but I'm off.

01:28:42.745 --> 01:28:49.434
Just off the record, I mean, this doesn't get in the way of another sabbatical coming up pretty soon, I would hope.

01:28:49.675 --> 01:28:49.935
No, no.

01:28:50.405 --> 01:28:59.419
It's a fabulous honor, and I'll tell you why it was, for me, an especially fabulous honor.

01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:03.084
The first one did not go to a historian.

01:29:03.946 --> 01:29:05.628
You would think, given the A.S.

01:29:05.949 --> 01:29:12.098
and the pool of historians out there, but the first one went to somebody who does English and American Studies.

01:29:12.499 --> 01:29:13.420
And a collector.

01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:14.522
And a collector, yeah.

01:29:14.738 --> 01:29:19.085
And so, and in fact, you know, books are flown out.

01:29:19.165 --> 01:29:21.428
David shared the books while they're here.

01:29:21.789 --> 01:29:22.890
They're in their stacks.

01:29:22.950 --> 01:29:24.513
I have to claw for my own books.

01:29:24.613 --> 01:29:26.496
How many books have you raised here?

01:29:27.097 --> 01:29:27.497
About 280.

01:29:28.439 --> 01:29:32.585
Well, obviously the whole company, you're not going to try and get all 500 books.

01:29:32.745 --> 01:29:33.707
Oh, no, no, no, no.

01:29:33.727 --> 01:29:35.129
I'm writing about 100 books, or 140 books.

01:29:35.830 --> 01:29:38.554
You're going to have an appendix of all the titles?

01:29:38.574 --> 01:29:39.115
Yeah, sure.

01:29:39.235 --> 01:29:40.577
Yeah, yeah.

01:29:40.793 --> 01:29:41.454
That's exciting.

01:29:41.654 --> 01:29:42.616
Yeah, it is exciting.

01:29:42.676 --> 01:29:46.421
And I'm imagining it as a kind of art book.

01:29:46.441 --> 01:29:51.248
All the inscriptions, all the annotations will be reproduced in a running right margin.

01:29:51.429 --> 01:29:52.991
I'll publish now so I can use it.

01:29:53.011 --> 01:29:53.331
Yeah.

01:29:53.852 --> 01:29:57.958
Well, when it comes out, it's going to be, I think, a wonderful book for collectors.

01:29:58.360 --> 01:30:01.964
want examples of signatures and learn about books and book ownership.

01:30:02.024 --> 01:30:08.090
You have a nice opening essay about your collecting... Yeah, well, yeah, I would.

01:30:08.110 --> 01:30:09.211
...what has driven this.

01:30:09.492 --> 01:30:21.124
I want this to make a perfect place to break because I think we now have to talk about, you mentioned a few things on the phone about your youth and how you need that background stuff.

01:30:21.164 --> 01:30:22.225
So I think I'm going to just...

01:30:22.205 --> 01:30:37.515
A book called The American Gardener, one of the first American Gardener books, printed, and here he is.

01:30:42.385 --> 01:30:44.449
He subscribed for five copies.

01:30:45.408 --> 01:30:46.349
Is his name in it?

01:30:46.849 --> 01:30:47.030
Yeah.

01:30:47.130 --> 01:30:47.350
Oh, wow.

01:30:47.370 --> 01:30:48.010
Thomas Jefferson.

01:30:48.131 --> 01:30:49.031
He's a subscriber.

01:30:49.112 --> 01:30:50.092
He's a subscriber.

01:30:50.213 --> 01:30:54.497
And this was published in Georgetown, right out of Washington.

01:30:54.517 --> 01:31:02.064
And there is his little initial, T. The I and J in Latin, of course, are the same letter.

01:31:02.404 --> 01:31:04.106
So there's no Js in these things.

01:31:04.566 --> 01:31:06.748
So it's Thomas Jefferson.

01:31:07.189 --> 01:31:08.490
And look what he does.

01:31:08.570 --> 01:31:11.533
He writes his T not the way you or I would write a T.

01:31:12.509 --> 01:31:19.558
He's trying to pun on the concept of a signature, a printed signature and his signature.

01:31:20.299 --> 01:31:21.700
So it's half print.

01:31:21.961 --> 01:31:38.381
He uses their J and his T, and then he uses their T and his J. But what's particularly interesting is look at the T. He used to write a script T. Then he concluded, a script T is too ostentatious.

01:31:38.421 --> 01:31:41.385
I have to do a print T. Look at this T.

01:31:42.023 --> 01:31:44.707
See the seraphs that come down from the top?

01:31:44.727 --> 01:31:48.893
And you're playing a printed T. Yeah, a printed T. And actually it's the first letter in the text.

01:31:48.974 --> 01:31:50.316
First letter in the text.

01:31:50.336 --> 01:31:52.679
You see how the T replicates the printed T?

01:31:52.839 --> 01:31:55.223
No one would make a top of the T that way.

01:31:55.343 --> 01:31:56.345
I'd go like this.

01:31:56.986 --> 01:31:57.607
Yeah, exactly.

01:31:58.168 --> 01:32:01.873
But he's got the little descenders, the seraphs, on either side.

01:32:03.275 --> 01:32:04.617
It's extraordinary.

01:32:04.637 --> 01:32:10.326
So this is America's Premier Guardian's copy of the American Guardian.

01:32:12.449 --> 01:32:25.449
This almanac was owned by a guy named Samuel Talbot, who was a Minuteman.

01:32:26.591 --> 01:32:26.751
1776.

01:32:26.771 --> 01:32:29.355
This is 1776.

01:32:29.475 --> 01:32:36.246
Let's go to the cover again.

01:32:37.778 --> 01:32:41.784
He uses this as a sort of diary, the way many people do.

01:32:41.804 --> 01:32:44.908
This is his signature, Samuel Talbot, 1776.

01:32:45.990 --> 01:32:49.775
And in February, he says he joined the circulating library.

01:32:50.276 --> 01:32:58.969
But then, in July, he writes, independence declared, independence declared, fourth day.

01:33:00.231 --> 01:33:03.195
So he puts it in the almanac.

01:33:04.205 --> 01:33:11.941
Now, he probably didn't hear until the 8th by the time the word got up to Boston.

01:33:11.961 --> 01:33:23.344
But this is a contemporary report at Bunker Hill.
