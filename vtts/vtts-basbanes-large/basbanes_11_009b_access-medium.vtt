WEBVTT

00:04.300 --> 00:07.444
Now it's switched over.

00:13.491 --> 00:15.854
This is wonderful.

00:22.702 --> 00:24.564
It's a magnet.

00:24.584 --> 00:26.747
Thank you so much.

00:28.330 --> 00:55.840
Where are the tapestries from, from another museum?

00:56.022 --> 01:05.523
from Florence and for the Palazzo Pitti, because in Palazzo Pitti you have a office for all things of the Medici and then Lorena family.

01:05.583 --> 01:06.766
So these are Medici?

01:06.786 --> 01:07.327
Yes, yes.

01:07.347 --> 01:09.051
This is in Cunapoli.

01:09.672 --> 01:11.617
This is in Cunapoli, printed.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.503
These are printed books out.

01:14.787 --> 01:24.095
Look at that, there's a book, a book on the tapestry.

01:24.115 --> 01:31.142
Oh, that's wonderful.

01:32.923 --> 01:35.045
That's wonderful.

01:35.245 --> 01:36.706
What is, who is that figure?

01:37.047 --> 01:37.867
The Time.

01:38.228 --> 01:39.569
Oh, that's Time, the book.

01:40.250 --> 01:41.491
Father Time.

01:41.831 --> 01:42.972
La Clessidra.

01:43.289 --> 01:50.176
And the book.

01:50.877 --> 01:55.041
The night with a little bird on the night.

01:55.481 --> 01:57.984
And the night.

01:58.524 --> 02:01.807
And the symbolism is time on top of the book.

02:01.827 --> 02:04.971
Time is passing.

02:05.972 --> 02:08.094
But why the book?

02:08.414 --> 02:12.418
Because the book is for always.

02:12.584 --> 02:14.015
Ah, wonderful.

02:14.096 --> 02:18.207
No, it's so wonderful because, yes, the book we have in the library,

02:18.389 --> 02:23.014
that he has opened in the 16th century, and it is always here.

02:23.815 --> 02:26.898
The time has passed, but not the books.

02:26.918 --> 02:30.702
The books are steady.

02:30.722 --> 02:46.418
It's Father's time and the hour ones... Are a system for... No, not proprio, I would say, the measure.

02:46.458 --> 02:47.839
The measure?

02:47.819 --> 02:58.858
because the books give the help to see the time who passed.

02:59.092 --> 03:18.771
I love it.

03:19.257 --> 03:35.321
Because the books help to see the history, who passed, because you have the history from the books.

03:35.641 --> 03:43.733
The history before the history is before the writing.

03:44.174 --> 03:46.918
That can almost be the jacket illustration.

03:47.776 --> 04:10.290
When the new cathedral has been constructed,

04:10.270 --> 04:21.411
It was necessary.

04:21.627 --> 04:31.541
to make the books for the mass, the priors, but very, very beautiful.

04:31.641 --> 04:36.868
Beautiful like the cathedral that was the most beautiful.

04:38.150 --> 04:48.765
And then commissioned by

04:49.032 --> 04:56.981
The most important artist has worked here with artists.

04:57.081 --> 05:00.785
They have to be so big because the people are singing from it.

05:00.805 --> 05:02.928
So it's one book so they can all read the music.

05:03.168 --> 05:11.637
That's why it's so big.

05:11.918 --> 05:15.782
The name of the desk for the choral is Badalone.

05:15.962 --> 05:16.643
Oh, nice.

05:17.011 --> 05:35.526
B-A-D-L-B-A-D-A-L-O-N-E-S-B-A-D-A-L-O-N-E-S-B-A-D-A-L-O-N-E-S-B-A-D-A-L-O-N-E-S-B-A-D-A-L-O-N-E-S-B-A-D-A-L-O-N-E-S-B-A-D-A-L-O-N-E-S-B-A-L-O-N-E-S-B-A-L-O-N-E-S-B-A-L-O-N-E-S-B-A-L-O-N-E-S-B-A-L-O-N-E-S-B-A-L-O-N-E-S-B-A-L-

05:35.827 --> 05:50.735
that it is always in the cathedral, in the museum of the cathedral you have an example of Badalone and also in Santa Croce the Church of the British can hold this influence.

05:52.298 --> 05:53.380
Look at this.

05:54.423 --> 06:13.866
In the catalogue you have a photo of because this is the river.

06:14.116 --> 06:17.781
I'm so sorry.

06:18.222 --> 06:37.748
I'm so sorry, that's horrible.

06:38.109 --> 06:39.651
Because the tree

06:39.884 --> 06:44.952
were on the Badalone, and then he has been saved by the Badalone.

06:45.833 --> 06:47.916
This was here in Florence?

06:47.936 --> 06:49.959
This was the flood here in Florence?

06:50.099 --> 06:54.165
No, no, yes, in Florence and in the cathedral, in the library of the cathedral.

06:54.506 --> 07:04.521
Twenty corals are being destroyed, but not three, and these, because the trees were in the Badalone, on the Badalone.

07:04.661 --> 07:07.165
The Badalone saved them, yes, okay.

07:07.185 --> 07:07.866
Badalone saved them.

07:07.846 --> 07:14.375
What a shame to survive so long.

07:14.395 --> 07:17.400
They lasted so many years to be destructed so recently.

07:17.960 --> 07:26.192
Yes, 30 years, but now they are being restored.

07:26.628 --> 07:31.095
This is wonderful.

07:31.155 --> 07:41.652
This is very beautiful because it is the end of the day, of course.

07:42.894 --> 07:52.369
The wives here and the streets.

07:52.569 --> 07:53.631
Thank you very much.

07:54.472 --> 07:55.293
Look at that.

07:55.513 --> 07:56.735
Look at that illumination.

07:58.176 --> 08:00.079
This is, what year is this?

08:00.099 --> 08:03.563
1445.

08:04.444 --> 08:08.829
So this is just five years before the invention of type.

08:10.431 --> 08:12.273
This is a manuscript too.

08:12.293 --> 08:16.058
It's just pre-printing before the invention of type just by about five years.

08:17.299 --> 08:18.681
It's wonderful.

08:19.202 --> 08:20.724
David pointed out this one.

08:20.804 --> 08:22.886
Do you actually see the street in Florence?

08:22.906 --> 08:24.428
Do you see it outside the door?

08:25.100 --> 08:25.781
You're kidding.

08:25.921 --> 08:26.963
That's what that is?

08:27.003 --> 08:28.446
Yes, that's what she said.

08:28.466 --> 08:30.950
You were saying this is a street?

08:31.251 --> 08:31.591
Yes.

08:31.832 --> 08:34.937
Actually a street in Florence that they... No, no, no.

08:34.957 --> 08:36.039
It is like.

08:36.400 --> 08:37.181
Like?

08:37.422 --> 08:42.811
Yes, yes.

08:43.452 --> 08:49.082
For example, you have there...

08:49.298 --> 08:54.757
the little part, it is a street of Florence, the Via dei Leoni.

08:56.021 --> 08:58.148
This is the Via dei Leoni.

08:58.188 --> 09:00.777
You have the lions and then you have the little

09:01.077 --> 09:20.344
This is an example of this connection between religious lives and civil lives, political and economic.

09:20.384 --> 09:25.831
Because the lion is the marzocco, the symbol of Firenze.

09:26.532 --> 09:30.578
Did you see the marzocco di Donatello?

09:30.878 --> 09:31.379
No.

09:32.641 --> 09:44.084
Because the Marzocco, you have a most famous statue by Donatello, it is the Marzocco, the lion, sits with the hands of Lawrence.

09:44.104 --> 09:46.288
And this is a symbol of...

09:46.775 --> 09:50.241
That's the symbol of Lorenz.

09:50.381 --> 09:56.532
And the bulls.

09:56.953 --> 10:04.767
The symbol of the opera del Duomo, the society for the cathedral.

10:04.747 --> 10:24.223
in a miniature of an event so important as the baptism of Christ by Giovanni Battista.

10:24.389 --> 10:42.498
And this is the representation of the Christ with Saint John, and then you have the Jerusalem of the sky, the paradise, but it is also the Florence, the representation of Florence.

10:43.379 --> 10:48.928
Yes, and Saint John was now, he is the son of Florence.

10:48.908 --> 10:53.072
Florence, the patron saint of Florence?

10:53.092 --> 11:01.301
Yes, the saint who gave... the patron saint of Florence.

11:01.321 --> 11:09.790
Yes, the saint who gave... the patron saint of Florence.

11:10.191 --> 11:11.913
The patron saint of Florence.

11:12.633 --> 11:16.958
Yes, the saint who gave... the patron saint of Florence.

11:19.840 --> 11:33.025
Was this an active center for illuminators in Florence?

11:33.045 --> 11:37.995
Were there a lot of illuminators and calligraphers in Scriptoria here in Florence?

11:38.015 --> 11:38.255
No.

11:38.536 --> 11:40.700
Ah, see, the books were here.

11:41.021 --> 11:42.844
Now it is...

11:43.432 --> 12:00.358
Some of them here, but the most in the monasteries in Italy, and then many of the books of the collection are collected by Lawrence the Magnificent, but by in Greece.

12:01.160 --> 12:04.064
They come in the Middle East, Palestine.

12:04.625 --> 12:06.308
So he went out and bought them?

12:06.328 --> 12:08.511
Yes.

12:11.258 --> 12:13.660
But that one is flooring.

12:13.760 --> 12:24.370
Wow, that was great.

12:24.690 --> 12:27.313
Yes, that's wonderful.

12:32.377 --> 12:38.903
Thanks for holding this.

12:39.018 --> 12:40.160
Oh, the miniatures, yes.

12:40.300 --> 12:45.468
Because you have here two, the two cathedrals of Florence.

12:46.169 --> 12:51.558
This is San Pietro Maggiore Church of Florence.

12:51.618 --> 13:01.313
But now it is not, it has been discussed in the 18th century.

13:01.597 --> 13:13.328
This is the church where has been the San Zanobi's miracles.

13:13.477 --> 13:14.598
Miracles.

13:14.759 --> 13:30.978
The baby says go down the windows and he has not a bed for Santa Nobita contamination.

13:31.058 --> 13:33.040
Is it the second church?

13:33.541 --> 13:36.164
Yes, they say.

13:38.567 --> 13:41.290
Cathedral Santa Maria del Fiore.

13:41.877 --> 13:57.792
They give us the date of the manuscript.

13:58.773 --> 14:00.875
Oh, it's dated.

14:01.295 --> 14:04.979
It is about 1331.

14:05.839 --> 14:10.804
Yes, this is the manuscript.

14:11.341 --> 14:15.548
And you can see that by the people.

14:15.628 --> 14:19.194
Yes, it's possible with these two.

14:19.214 --> 14:24.843
With the Santana, the miracles, and then with the history of... Of the people.

14:25.083 --> 14:28.689
Santa Maria del Fiore, the new... The new cathedral.

14:28.709 --> 14:31.614
Oh, so that's the evidence from the picture that you can get it.

14:31.654 --> 14:33.737
Thank you.

14:33.717 --> 14:55.669
Does that painting look 600 years old to you?

14:55.689 --> 15:01.277
Does it have in the catalogue another miniature where we can see another

15:01.257 --> 15:05.321
You can make comparisons.

15:07.924 --> 15:09.806
By the evidence in the picture.

15:11.128 --> 15:14.271
That's called internal evidence.

15:15.292 --> 15:21.699
That's the essence of bibliography.

15:23.381 --> 15:24.583
How about the people coming here?

15:25.364 --> 15:26.725
This is great.

15:28.477 --> 15:40.273
I think I should write a catalog of this exhibition, yes.

15:42.416 --> 15:43.617
What is the content here?

15:43.637 --> 15:47.483
Is this again a literature?

15:47.903 --> 15:50.106
A lectionary.

15:50.487 --> 15:51.688
A lectionary.

15:51.808 --> 15:56.695
A lectionary.

15:56.675 --> 16:02.302
I can understand some of the Italian.

16:02.423 --> 16:05.166
It's very good.

16:05.907 --> 16:06.908
Yeah.

16:10.633 --> 16:12.195
This is wonderful.

16:12.215 --> 16:14.298
Ah, wonderful.

16:15.099 --> 16:21.447
Is it by a friend from France?

16:23.330 --> 16:25.753
Mm-hmm.

16:26.358 --> 16:37.667
Most of the stuff, most of the material is Italian of course.

16:37.765 --> 16:48.257
Look at how fine the handwriting is here, how very tightly condensed it is.

16:48.337 --> 16:58.488
It is not very beautiful to write on the book.

16:58.568 --> 17:03.233
No, but those are reader's notes.

17:03.213 --> 17:06.157
But those are the reader's annotations probably, is that what she's saying?

17:06.338 --> 17:15.852
No, this is the notes, the commentary to the text of the person who had the books.

17:15.872 --> 17:16.152
Yes, okay.

17:16.453 --> 17:18.856
That's the commentary of the reader.

17:18.936 --> 17:20.018
No, not always.

17:30.914 --> 17:31.735
Hello.

17:35.140 --> 17:52.717
Because we are, the Laurentiana is the most important library in the world for the quality of this collection of manuscripts.

17:53.357 --> 18:03.527
Because we have an important collection for the Father of the Church, for example.

18:03.963 --> 18:13.356
but also for the poetry and for the original autograph by Petrarcha, Bocaccia.

18:15.559 --> 18:22.328
But at the age of the open it is not so important and you have only two basic on Petrarcha and Bocaccia.

18:22.348 --> 18:24.491
But now we have the original, the autographs.

18:24.912 --> 18:25.973
You have the Holocaust?

18:25.993 --> 18:32.282
Yes, by Petrarcha and Bocaccia.

18:33.258 --> 18:44.169
There's a holographic chair that takes back a book, aren't you?

18:44.189 --> 18:46.811
That's where the books were.

18:47.152 --> 18:53.738
These are the catalogs for those books.

18:53.838 --> 18:59.704
Yes, yes, for the father of the church in Letting Hill, for the idea of the quote,

18:59.903 --> 19:00.784
of the number.

19:01.205 --> 19:06.752
Then you have the historian, the philosopher, and you have many cicerone.

19:08.034 --> 19:11.038
And you said two desks for Pitchcock and Pitchcock.

19:11.058 --> 19:12.300
Yes, yes.

19:12.320 --> 19:14.503
For example, another thinking process is this.

19:14.523 --> 19:29.083
You have only two desks for the astronomians in Greek and Latin, but with four, it is not now, but there were four, the name is Sfere Armillani,

19:29.502 --> 19:33.770
The stair for the movement of the planet.

19:34.631 --> 19:37.336
The motion of the planet.

19:38.558 --> 19:40.401
It's the whole thing inside.

19:40.421 --> 19:47.233
It is forbidden to employ the fire or candles to see the books.

19:47.253 --> 19:49.958
And then you have only the original natural life.

19:50.562 --> 19:54.105
But now we have not the original light because we have five windows closed.

19:54.125 --> 19:56.908
So when they read here, the light just came from here?

19:57.188 --> 20:01.112
No, from here, because it is the second original thing in this library.

20:01.132 --> 20:04.615
It is that it is not to the south, but it is east.

20:04.635 --> 20:06.937
An east-west, eastern explosion.

20:06.957 --> 20:20.029
Yes, but now we have not the original light because of five closed windows in the 19th century, and then because the Basilic has built a new building there on the line.

20:20.566 --> 20:24.130
And then we have not the original soft yellow light.

20:24.631 --> 20:27.735
So all the light was outside, natural, no candles?

20:27.755 --> 20:29.076
No, no, no.

20:29.096 --> 20:32.721
It is for the candle.

20:32.881 --> 20:33.862
So when was the reading?

20:33.882 --> 20:36.706
Just for a few hours during the day?

20:36.786 --> 20:43.694
Yeah, from March, April or February to September, you have a good light.

20:45.457 --> 20:46.658
A good light to read.

20:49.372 --> 21:13.268
How was the room for circulation?

21:13.288 --> 21:15.852
Did the books hold up very well over the years?

21:16.456 --> 21:19.002
There was no humidity that hurt the books?

21:19.022 --> 21:19.242
No, no, no.

21:19.263 --> 21:21.949
This is the last control in September.

21:22.109 --> 21:25.216
They said it is very perfect for the humidity.

21:25.417 --> 21:27.201
You have there for the temperature.

21:28.223 --> 21:28.664
Excuse me.

21:28.684 --> 21:31.090
Now you have here 16.

21:31.508 --> 21:35.974
for temperature and five, six for the humidity.

21:36.134 --> 21:42.142
And this is the top for the collection of the books here and then also downstairs.

21:42.703 --> 21:48.430
But this is constructed like this for the life and then also for the humidity.

21:48.450 --> 21:51.755
And how many desks do you think will be hard enough?

21:51.775 --> 21:52.095
88.

21:52.275 --> 21:53.877
88 desks.

21:53.898 --> 21:54.458
Desks.

21:54.498 --> 21:59.225
But two desks have been constructed in 19th centuries.

21:59.345 --> 22:00.226
To remove.

22:00.706 --> 22:01.127
Yes.

22:01.360 --> 22:02.702
To get into that room?

22:02.722 --> 22:02.862
Yes.

22:03.723 --> 22:04.904
So there were 90, actually.

22:05.045 --> 22:06.487
There were originally 90?

22:06.607 --> 22:07.368
No, no, no.

22:07.388 --> 22:10.792
The original in the 19th century is open.

22:10.812 --> 22:11.092
Yes.

22:11.112 --> 22:14.497
I've been distracted and now we have, we don't know where.

22:15.037 --> 22:16.159
But you have 88 now.

22:16.179 --> 22:18.261
88 now, yes.

22:18.281 --> 22:20.264
Can't talk.

22:28.154 --> 22:30.557
The direction of the library.

22:32.512 --> 22:33.794
This is a map of Florence?

22:34.354 --> 22:35.616
No, of Paris.

22:35.636 --> 22:35.997
Of Paris.

22:36.017 --> 22:38.080
I was going to say, that doesn't look like the Arno River.

22:38.100 --> 22:40.122
That's the, that's the scene.

22:42.726 --> 22:44.148
That's a very old map.

22:45.550 --> 22:53.360
I don't know, I don't know if it's the region, but I think, you know what I said?

22:53.460 --> 22:54.081
Balle.

22:55.683 --> 22:56.224
That's it.
