WEBVTT

00:03.035 --> 00:12.159
And I'm also swimming every other day to keep in shape.

00:12.179 --> 00:17.112
But the irregular hours of eating and sleeping are just simple.

00:17.227 --> 00:20.854
Now, on the East is East tour, that was a dry tour.

00:20.874 --> 00:25.102
I did no drinking for the time I was on the tour, and I was utterly miserable the entire time.

00:25.583 --> 00:28.629
On the Whaleville tour, I drank all the time, and I was utterly miserable.

00:28.749 --> 00:32.457
So I figured we'll go back and see, like the square one.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.204
You've got to be able to moderate in some place in the middle.

00:36.224 --> 00:39.370
I'm not a moderating kind of guy, you know, that's the problem.

00:39.350 --> 00:46.287
However, I do see that this tour eventually, toward the end, will take me to Edinburgh, where I haven't been since 1977.

00:46.307 --> 00:49.435
And I think that the tour might get a little damp when I get to Edinburgh.

00:50.358 --> 00:51.661
It takes you there when to do that?

00:52.563 --> 00:55.671
Oh, God, I think in mid...

00:56.191 --> 00:57.032
Mid-November.

00:57.072 --> 00:59.756
The tour is about at least 46, right?

01:01.719 --> 01:02.741
Some up there.

01:02.781 --> 01:05.425
I would say, yeah, in the 30s anyway.

01:05.445 --> 01:05.926
I'm not sure.

01:05.986 --> 01:07.368
I didn't count.

01:08.109 --> 01:12.055
You mentioned that you could be doing some research.

01:12.075 --> 01:14.418
You don't mind if we hop around a little bit?

01:14.458 --> 01:15.240
Yeah, anything you want.

01:15.981 --> 01:16.121
Okay.

01:16.141 --> 01:19.566
You said you're doing research in Madison for the next book.

01:22.651 --> 01:24.133
Why Madison?

01:24.154 --> 01:26.998
I could ask the same question.

01:27.018 --> 01:29.362
I'm writing about an historical figure.

01:29.863 --> 01:40.341
It's a love story set, a very perverted love story set in the turn of the century about a figure in my new neighborhood in Montecito, California.

01:41.763 --> 01:48.895
I don't want to reveal his name, but he was the heir to a great industrial fortune from the Midwest.

01:49.246 --> 01:54.534
A very handsome guy, graduated cum laude from Princeton in 96.

01:55.355 --> 01:58.219
He got married in 1904 to a very beautiful woman.

01:58.279 --> 01:59.241
I've seen her pictures.

02:00.062 --> 02:07.453
Who was, you know, later to become strong in the suffragette movement.

02:07.533 --> 02:10.257
She was also very wealthy, very cultured.

02:11.239 --> 02:14.083
He was second graduate of MIT in the sciences.

02:15.204 --> 02:15.625
But...

02:16.094 --> 02:24.863
But shortly after the marriage, he had a schizophrenic breakdown, was confined on his estate up the street from my house for the rest of his life.

02:25.083 --> 02:28.247
And for the next 20 years, he never laid eyes on any woman.

02:28.968 --> 02:33.693
That includes his wife, his mother, his sister, because he would violently assault any woman he saw.

02:33.753 --> 02:43.603
Finally, 20 years later, the wife, who hung in through all of this, even though the marriage was never consummated and the family was trying to get rid of her because of financial

02:44.039 --> 03:11.262
situation she got a freudian shrink in and through analysis this gentleman began to calm down enough so that he could finally see his wife again after 20 years it's a great story why madison if this family's papers are gathered in the madison historical society this would be a long historical novel and you may have noticed since you've been with me off from the beginning you may have noticed that i'm doing

03:11.579 --> 03:16.408
a longer historical novel, a collection, and then a contemporary novel.

03:16.429 --> 03:25.166
And at the end of that, with this now, that cycle, the new stories have about two-thirds of the next book of stories done, which I've written this year after I finished that.

03:25.967 --> 03:31.478
You've seen some of them, I think, in The New Yorker, and another will be in Playboy soon, and Paris Review, and so on.

03:32.133 --> 03:36.842
But I like to do the stories in two separate periods because then I'm pressure.

03:37.183 --> 03:39.267
So I'll hold those stories until after the novel.

03:39.407 --> 03:46.682
I'll have another period of stories, and by then I'll have an idea for another inflammatory contemporary novel.

03:47.162 --> 03:51.812
A couple of questions arising out of this.

03:51.832 --> 03:52.032
Thank you.

03:52.012 --> 03:54.995
Is this something you just created in the neighborhood?

03:55.295 --> 03:57.458
I read an article.

03:57.838 --> 04:09.390
Montecito had a lot of great estates built there in the period of 1900 through around 1920 and beyond, but especially in that era because it was pre-income tax.

04:09.590 --> 04:16.997
The very wealthy industrialists, particularly from Chicago, New York, and so on, couldn't they go to Florida?

04:17.017 --> 04:20.601
They could just get in their own Pullman car and go out to California.

04:20.851 --> 04:24.134
And there were a lot of great stories associated with it.

04:24.315 --> 04:26.217
This one in particular fascinated me.

04:27.298 --> 04:32.243
You may remember all the way back to Descent of Man how much I love monkeys and I'm obsessed with them.

04:32.263 --> 04:33.684
This story also has monkeys.

04:34.345 --> 04:42.353
The first primate lab ever in the world was on this guy's estate.

04:42.874 --> 04:47.078
A shrink talked the wife into finding the primate lab on the estate

04:47.547 --> 04:52.334
He figured if he could study the sexual habits of monkeys, he could apply it to her husband and cure him.

04:52.354 --> 04:53.415
Of course, he didn't.

04:53.455 --> 04:55.078
Are you going to use actual names?

04:55.498 --> 04:56.219
Yeah.

04:56.239 --> 05:00.566
I just don't want to reveal it right now because I don't want people to jump on my story.

05:01.026 --> 05:03.630
It's going to take me two years to write it.

05:03.710 --> 05:04.752
I mean, I'm sure.

05:05.052 --> 05:07.155
No, these are historical figures, but they're minor.

05:07.175 --> 05:08.417
I mean, no one knows about them.

05:08.697 --> 05:11.021
But they're the best time, I think.

05:11.161 --> 05:13.784
Tell the story that hasn't been told.

05:13.804 --> 05:14.345
Exactly.

05:14.425 --> 05:16.288
Exactly.

05:16.268 --> 05:37.638
I've been going into the bookstores and, you know, he's just been there and there's piles of his books and I would say to the books, you know, my apprenticeship for having written The Tortilla Curtain was I wrote nine other books, you know, I went to college, I got a PhD, I went to writing school, I taught writing for 18 years.

05:37.678 --> 05:40.842
His apprenticeship for writing his book was conquering a wreck.

05:40.822 --> 05:44.957
Of course, he didn't actually write his book.

05:45.057 --> 05:49.954
I'm 52, writing my first book, and I love the suggestion from my hometown.

05:50.137 --> 06:13.427
i'm an overnight success you know yeah i said after 30 years of trying that's great anyway well people don't like to see you succeed i found that all my life you know every corner i turn people say you can't do that you know like uh you can't be a writer there's no money in it nobody could get published and then they said to me

06:13.762 --> 06:14.964
You want to be a professor?

06:14.984 --> 06:16.367
There's no jobs for a professor.

06:16.407 --> 06:17.469
You're crazy.

06:17.489 --> 06:19.352
I said, maybe there is one.

06:19.532 --> 06:22.818
Maybe there's one, and that's the one I'm looking for.

06:22.838 --> 06:23.379
That's right.

06:23.760 --> 06:26.685
Well, my book had been under contract to randomize.

06:26.705 --> 06:27.466
Under contract.

06:27.486 --> 06:28.668
It canceled it.

06:29.490 --> 06:32.776
And they told me, your book will not sell 3,000 copies.

06:32.796 --> 06:33.878
I said, you're wrong.

06:33.898 --> 06:34.639
You're wrong.

06:35.007 --> 06:38.531
and we have 35,000 in print now, the third printing.

06:39.452 --> 06:44.979
That is fantastic for a non-fiction specialized book like that.

06:45.860 --> 06:46.140
Great.

06:46.340 --> 06:47.261
Who is your publisher?

06:47.562 --> 06:47.782
Both.

06:48.382 --> 06:54.049
Well, he must be good at finding the niche for it and getting it in there.

06:54.129 --> 06:56.472
You know, signing 400 books.

06:57.153 --> 07:01.117
Hello.

07:01.237 --> 07:02.719
You must be tough.

07:02.935 --> 07:10.327
Yeah, I drink about half a cup of coffee every decade.

07:10.567 --> 07:14.574
It makes, puts me into outer space.

07:14.654 --> 07:15.956
Look at me, look at me.

07:16.016 --> 07:18.480
I'm just, I'm skin and bones as it is.

07:18.460 --> 07:20.623
Yeah, me too, right?

07:20.723 --> 07:25.349
Anyway, you're talking about the novels, the stories.

07:25.869 --> 07:31.556
It seems to me that you really have... You talk about how you're happy, number one, with the Ark of Ybtilio.

07:31.897 --> 07:34.160
I think, obviously, you must be.

07:34.180 --> 07:37.524
But it seems to me also that you've really plotted the Ark of Ybtilio.

07:37.544 --> 07:39.907
Is that a fair statement?

07:39.927 --> 07:43.491
Well, in the way that I just told you what I intend to do next.

07:43.511 --> 07:48.197
I've always told my publisher what I'm going to do next, when I'm going to deliver it, and I always deliver it.

07:48.177 --> 07:49.479
On time, on before.

07:49.959 --> 07:51.201
As published?

07:51.982 --> 07:52.263
Oh, yeah.

07:52.283 --> 07:53.124
Pretty much as.

07:53.244 --> 07:53.344
Yeah.

07:53.364 --> 08:02.336
Yeah, I'm pretty determined to keep exploring my work and trying to grow and do different things.

08:02.417 --> 08:07.744
But, I mean, I certainly don't calculate how the public is going to receive what I do.

08:08.325 --> 08:11.369
That's something beyond my control.

08:11.529 --> 08:13.332
For instance, with this book.

08:13.352 --> 08:15.615
This is the first book that's really been controversial.

08:15.755 --> 08:15.855
Sure.

08:16.426 --> 08:25.356
There have been some very nasty attacks on me, ad hominem attacks on me in the press, and I realize it's because, just as I think you're suggesting, people think

08:25.910 --> 08:29.393
Now, what perceive me now as being on top of the heap, and they don't like that.

08:29.413 --> 08:31.855
They want to take me down a peg.

08:31.895 --> 08:43.385
Secondly, too, of course, it's a real hot-button topic, and a lot of people are judging it on its politics, whether they agree or disagree, and not really, I think, looking into the deeper structure of it.

08:43.405 --> 08:45.687
Well, you know, in time, I think they will.

08:46.148 --> 08:51.353
I'm a part of that's largely coming from California where this is.

08:51.473 --> 08:51.693
No.

08:51.793 --> 08:54.195
Actually, there's been a lot of support in California.

08:54.175 --> 08:57.582
There was a very nasty review in the L.A.

08:57.602 --> 09:05.097
Times the other day, but they had already done a front-page lifestyle thing with a review of the book, which was very favorable.

09:05.178 --> 09:12.593
It must make the people who read both of these things feel schizophrenic because the take on the book is so, so strange.

09:12.653 --> 09:14.597
But, you know, California's moment may have been good.

09:15.016 --> 09:23.995
In fact, I would say that normally when I come out with a book, I've been very lucky with the reviewers, maybe 9 to 1 in my favor.

09:24.015 --> 09:27.743
I'd say this time we're running about maybe two-thirds in my favor.

09:27.892 --> 09:34.783
However, those two-thirds are very passionate for me, and the one-third, oh, they are raking me over the coast.

09:35.183 --> 09:41.613
And I'm also seeing on these live talk shows when the call ends, just mention the topic of illegal immigration.

09:41.633 --> 09:43.536
People go insane, you know.

09:43.676 --> 09:48.784
I had the great pleasure and distinction of being called human garbage on a radio show in San Francisco the other night.

09:48.804 --> 09:50.507
I thanked the woman for the compliment.

09:50.487 --> 09:53.116
Are people talking about the novel?

09:54.320 --> 09:56.126
Yes, they are, if they get deeper into it.

09:56.226 --> 09:58.755
I think the attacks on me, they're just reading the surface.

09:58.775 --> 10:00.902
They're ready to...

10:01.979 --> 10:03.561
It's very biased reviewing, I think.

10:03.581 --> 10:08.188
They're ready to level their guns in me, and they let blast without really thinking about it.

10:08.529 --> 10:11.774
And they've seen very propunctory summaries of them.

10:11.874 --> 10:14.578
I think so, and inaccurate, too, in many cases.

10:15.279 --> 10:17.402
That's what I found in my book.

10:17.422 --> 10:20.367
I cannot believe the number of poets that have made reviews.

10:20.467 --> 10:22.991
See, I anticipated this, Nick, many years ago.

10:23.011 --> 10:28.459
You may remember in East is East, I wrote about the writer's colony and the petty jealousies and so on.

10:28.979 --> 10:40.498
You know, you get to a point where you are seen, perceived as somebody that you really aren't because of all the profiles in the press and their books and so on.

10:41.019 --> 10:42.982
And you're partly responsible for that.

10:43.002 --> 10:43.963
Sure, sure.

10:44.044 --> 10:45.947
Because you do project a persona.

10:46.127 --> 10:46.588
That's right.

10:46.668 --> 10:49.873
And because I have been so productive, this is my...

10:51.001 --> 10:52.665
six books since 1987.

10:52.805 --> 11:03.711
I'm out there always before the public and I think that kind of grates on other writers perhaps who aren't doing as well or think that they should be doing better and so on.

11:04.079 --> 11:30.660
it's inevitable but again uh i began to realize that i don't really enjoy fielding these assaults but on the other hand this is the best-selling book i've ever done you know oh it's going crazy hey i love it by the way oh thank you people are really responding to it and again the controversy may not be so bad controversy can be good yeah but it hurts me personally to read this crap you know one of your neighbors

11:30.640 --> 11:34.105
I haven't met her.

11:34.145 --> 11:35.427
I've only lived there two years.

11:35.447 --> 11:41.555
I'm sure I'll run into her eventually.

11:43.218 --> 11:45.180
But that's a different thing altogether.

11:45.201 --> 11:48.105
I mean, this is genre fiction.

11:48.225 --> 11:49.927
People don't take it that seriously.

11:50.007 --> 11:54.293
She's got her fans.

11:56.176 --> 11:56.597
That's true.

11:56.617 --> 11:59.581
I mean, I don't mean to dismiss her work, but it is a different thing.

11:59.661 --> 12:00.462
It's not...

12:00.982 --> 12:04.766
reviewed as seriously as literature is.

12:06.528 --> 12:10.532
So therefore you do read the reviews that you get very carefully?

12:10.552 --> 12:11.653
Sure, not very well.

12:12.273 --> 12:12.874
Yes, I do.

12:13.174 --> 12:13.455
I do.

12:13.575 --> 12:16.177
I have to admit it.

12:16.658 --> 12:28.710
I don't blame him, because you see, a lot of people lose sight of the fact that criticism is supposed to be disinterested, and if you do have a bias, you're supposed to beg off that review, as I have done many times.

12:29.365 --> 12:32.790
And I do hold a grudge because people are so petty.

12:35.433 --> 12:39.639
On the other hand, you've got to put it behind you, and you've got to expect it.

12:39.659 --> 12:48.010
And you also then have to praise the people who, you know, it really gives you a charge when you have somebody who reads it in the way that you felt you intended it.

12:48.391 --> 12:52.917
Michael Gerger from The Post, wonderful critic, a Pulitzer Prize winning critic.

12:53.097 --> 12:55.120
He loved my book, gave it a full page.

12:55.690 --> 12:59.395
And he found a few problems with the crime.

12:59.615 --> 13:01.237
But he didn't mock me, you see.

13:01.257 --> 13:05.863
I think it's the mocking review that you want us to pay for a person over.

13:06.584 --> 13:11.670
How dare they, in 20 minutes, you know, take... I am a work that takes so much time.

13:11.690 --> 13:14.574
I don't review... And who are they, after all, you know?

13:14.894 --> 13:15.375
Who are they?

13:15.395 --> 13:16.116
Are they my equal?

13:16.536 --> 13:18.278
Do they appreciate or understand what I do?

13:18.298 --> 13:19.780
Are they capable of understanding?

13:19.800 --> 13:22.744
Particularly with satire, a lot of people...

13:22.724 --> 13:26.348
It pushes their buttons and they don't really get what the aim of it is.

13:28.630 --> 13:32.174
I've only reviewed a couple of books in my time because I simply don't have time.

13:32.274 --> 13:36.118
I'm teaching, I'm traveling with books every year, and I'm writing books.

13:37.199 --> 13:46.910
And twice I've reviewed books very prominently by prominent authors who perhaps had written a lesser book.

13:46.950 --> 13:47.831
I could take that anyway.

13:47.851 --> 13:50.153
I want it, couldn't I?

13:50.173 --> 13:51.735
My reviews always...

13:52.087 --> 13:53.991
There's so many ways of putting criticism.

13:54.031 --> 14:01.645
My reviews have done reviews in which I say, this person's career has done such and such, and I admire this and that, and in this book there are many things I admire.

14:01.665 --> 14:07.497
Then you give a paragraph of reservations, because you're obligated to do that, I think, if you're going to take on a review.

14:07.777 --> 14:10.382
But you could twist that any way you want, you know.

14:10.402 --> 14:12.947
If you do it respectfully...

14:13.265 --> 14:41.280
you take the book on its terms and you don't when i was in editing the book setting i would never i would never have no mocking review period i mean and i didn't and i didn't even try and take the high road somebody turned in something that sandwiched the person because i'd kill it well first again nick i mean i would be disingenuous if i said that i ex here i am pushing buttons making fun of of liberals and their hypocrisy but there's a demonstrating fun i think it's like

14:41.260 --> 14:47.468
demonstrating the anatomy of racism, because it's meant to correct their behavior.

14:47.488 --> 14:50.992
I'd be disingenuous if I said I expect them to love me for doing that, you know.

14:51.393 --> 15:01.706
But again, ultimately, I don't care, because I'm going to do exactly what I want anyway, have total confidence in my vision and what I'm doing, and to hell with that.

15:02.006 --> 15:03.669
That's a great quote.

15:03.829 --> 15:04.590
I see these in text.

15:04.610 --> 15:05.631
Thank you.

15:05.611 --> 15:10.697
Some of the reviews have said that you're kind of exploring new levels of your ability here.

15:10.977 --> 15:12.479
I am trying to.

15:12.659 --> 15:14.301
And I agree with that.

15:14.321 --> 15:15.662
But I still think you're very funny.

15:16.483 --> 15:18.065
In this book, yes, I am.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.027
But it's a different kind of humor, isn't it?

15:20.147 --> 15:24.092
As I mentioned before, I like this book.

15:24.152 --> 15:24.793
I love it.

15:25.093 --> 15:26.755
There's no bite to it.

15:26.855 --> 15:31.500
And, you know, I think maybe that's what's...

15:31.480 --> 15:36.526
I like what you say, it has bite to it.

15:36.587 --> 15:37.207
I agree.

15:37.368 --> 15:45.898
I've been defending myself in this way.

15:45.938 --> 15:49.803
Satire has to have bite to it.

15:49.843 --> 15:54.990
And if it bites, sure, if it bites, it hurts.

15:56.455 --> 15:57.717
I'm glad you see it that way.

15:58.098 --> 16:06.530
There are plenty of people in my camp, I don't mean to cough about this, and when you write something about a topic as controversial or this, people are just going to go haywire anyway.

16:07.211 --> 16:13.661
Did you anticipate this, what is it, 187, the proposition, I don't know if I got the number right?

16:13.842 --> 16:14.362
Yes.

16:14.923 --> 16:18.649
It's kind of written as a... This is written, well...

16:18.950 --> 16:25.237
The whole drumbeat was sounding, but this book was finished in August of last year, prior to the November election.

16:25.257 --> 16:27.340
And I began it in December of 82.

16:27.880 --> 16:31.785
It took me a year in the writing, but there were certain dislocations in my lifetime.

16:32.105 --> 16:37.311
Three months on tour of Wellville, and then a move to an old house that needed repair, and et cetera, et cetera.

16:38.252 --> 16:43.118
Yeah, I guess I did, but I wrote it actually to sort out my own feelings.

16:43.553 --> 17:08.059
uh on proposition 187 on this kind of demonizing of a whole class or race of people um to respond to the articles about illegal immigrants that are very inflammatory in the la times every day to uh to reveal what the liberals really say at the cocktail party when no one's listening you know it's definitely

17:09.052 --> 17:11.174
I don't know.

17:11.194 --> 17:13.116
The decade still has five years for one.

17:13.576 --> 17:17.240
For me, it's almost a quintessential California novel of the 1990s.

17:17.340 --> 17:19.402
It's a lot of descriptions.

17:19.422 --> 17:20.523
But would you accept that?

17:20.783 --> 17:24.627
I like that idea, and I hope that it will open the debate for others.

17:24.967 --> 17:34.356
You know, the people who live in Arroyo Blanco, like Jack Jardine, they make no bones about it.

17:34.536 --> 17:34.836
You know?

17:35.156 --> 17:36.898
They make no bones about how they feel.

17:37.182 --> 17:41.308
Delaney, though, I mean him to be sympathetic to a degree.

17:41.328 --> 17:42.770
Yes, he's a figure of satire.

17:43.411 --> 17:45.874
He's well-meaning, but you know, so are we all.

17:46.174 --> 17:49.759
But when it comes down to a moment of action, do you act?

17:49.780 --> 17:51.001
And he doesn't.

17:51.021 --> 17:56.329
And he becomes drawn into this hate and paranoia that is absolutely pandemic out there.

17:56.589 --> 17:57.330
I tell you, it is.

17:57.370 --> 18:02.297
I am not advocating illegal immigration.

18:02.357 --> 18:03.218
I am opposed to it.

18:03.819 --> 18:04.540
However...

18:05.245 --> 18:09.029
I'm much more opposed to this kind of painting everybody with a brush.

18:09.049 --> 18:10.030
All Mexicans are dirty.

18:10.070 --> 18:10.831
They're all illegal.

18:11.192 --> 18:11.973
They're all evil.

18:12.553 --> 18:18.880
I love Mexican culture, but that's beside the point.

18:18.900 --> 18:25.828
What I mean is, if you know an individual of any race, whatever, you can't then say that all of these people are evil.

18:25.868 --> 18:30.173
My intent here is to let you know a couple of people and judge for yourself.

18:30.153 --> 18:36.120
You'll notice that twice in the book, Delaney blames people for having done something they didn't do.

18:36.541 --> 18:42.928
The first time, Jose Navidad, who we know did something really evil, is blamed for the fire, which he didn't set.

18:43.469 --> 18:48.515
And secondly, Delaney blames Kundilo for the graffiti, which, as it turns out, Jack Jr.

18:48.555 --> 18:48.715
did.

18:48.755 --> 18:52.920
And even when he discovers that, he's so far convinced anyway, he ignores it.

18:53.491 --> 19:03.601
You know, I was doing work on my book and spent some time, quite a bit of time, in California.

19:03.621 --> 19:07.645
And I remember going out to Bel Air, to what is essentially a gated city.

19:07.665 --> 19:08.746
It's a neighborhood.

19:08.866 --> 19:17.134
I mean, you go through these archives, and you see Glow South, who's a major Hollywood producer, and he was there.

19:17.154 --> 19:18.695
And I mean, every house has these gated cities.

19:18.816 --> 19:23.380
I think maybe people aren't aware of how

19:24.338 --> 19:28.224
Well, there are a lot of ironies in the book.

19:28.425 --> 19:30.728
I mean, who is building the gate?

19:31.109 --> 19:35.015
The gate is built by the illegals, you know?

19:35.035 --> 19:38.220
They're driving to school.

19:38.801 --> 19:43.409
And so she was asking about the book.

19:43.869 --> 19:46.093
And I said, she said, well, he's putting on...

19:46.580 --> 19:51.407
I said, they're putting a cape around the government to Asia.

19:51.487 --> 19:53.449
I said, it's to keep the Mexicans out.

19:53.529 --> 19:54.230
I said, really?

19:54.310 --> 19:56.974
I said, but it's the government.

19:57.415 --> 19:58.356
Thank you.

19:58.376 --> 20:00.098
There are so many ironies in the book.

20:00.118 --> 20:01.420
That was the fun of it for me.

20:01.560 --> 20:04.444
It cuts so many different ways, all these ironies in the book.

20:04.785 --> 20:13.937
Oh, I have a 15-year-old daughter as well who is missing me right now terribly because she has nobody to type her college papers for her.

20:13.977 --> 20:16.080
She's taking college courses now.

20:16.060 --> 20:21.973
And where's old dad when she needs him?

20:22.975 --> 20:25.781
Dad cleans up the language.

20:26.282 --> 20:27.725
He can't help himself.

20:27.925 --> 20:29.569
You know, I teach.

20:29.889 --> 20:35.942
I read each of my students and I usually will have about 40 to 45 per semester.

20:36.243 --> 20:40.088
writes four original things, no length limit, per semester.

20:40.909 --> 20:46.015
I had copy at it line by line, so I can't help but help her clean it up a little bit.

20:46.476 --> 20:50.301
I mean, imagination is everything, invention is everything.

20:50.321 --> 20:53.185
How much of this is how it works?

20:53.205 --> 20:54.386
In this particular book?

20:54.406 --> 20:57.390
In general, in terms of the work ethic, when you're tracking it.

20:57.742 --> 21:00.746
Well, I think since 1978, I guess it is.

21:00.766 --> 21:02.588
Yeah, since I got out of graduate school.

21:02.608 --> 21:03.889
I met at USC.

21:04.690 --> 21:06.372
I'm a guy who sticks with things, you know.

21:06.392 --> 21:08.395
I like to make jokes about my first wife.

21:08.435 --> 21:10.297
She was such an incredible pain in the ass.

21:10.377 --> 21:11.859
I've stayed with her all these years.

21:16.344 --> 21:23.513
You know, a lot of times in a Q&A after a reading, a lot of the audience wants to know about that.

21:23.797 --> 21:33.149
How much of it is perseverance in work and how much of it is a kind of natural gift?

21:33.310 --> 21:35.953
If you don't have a natural gift, can you be a great artist?

21:36.694 --> 21:37.996
Well, the sad answer is no.

21:39.137 --> 21:50.833
But if you do have the gift, and many people do, which is one of the excitements of teaching to see how many people do have the gift, it takes a kind of fanatical perseverance to develop it.

21:50.932 --> 21:52.134
and to continue to develop.

21:52.194 --> 21:56.720
I could have written another Road to Wellville kind of comedy and satire.

21:56.740 --> 21:58.823
I want to do something that twists in your gut.

21:58.843 --> 21:59.844
I want to do something different.

22:00.946 --> 22:02.628
Because if you don't, I think you're dead.

22:02.668 --> 22:04.571
You write the same book over and over again.

22:04.851 --> 22:05.953
You know what's fun about that?

22:06.674 --> 22:09.518
Well, it might be fun, but I don't think you grow at all.

22:10.219 --> 22:12.602
Well, you're under 50.

22:13.662 --> 22:20.452
I mean, you do see it as a body of work.

22:21.613 --> 22:26.360
If somebody was to read, to set out to read the T.C.

22:26.400 --> 22:31.948
Boyle, do you really recommend they start with book one and ask the questions?

22:31.968 --> 22:34.692
Sure, and what would we see in your view?

22:35.262 --> 22:36.343
It's very interesting.

22:36.383 --> 22:41.809
A few years ago, I'm hoping I'm asking questions that you haven't had.

22:41.829 --> 22:42.790
These are good questions.

22:42.871 --> 22:46.134
A few years ago, a guy did a profile on me in the New York Times.

22:46.154 --> 22:47.356
I believe it was Bruce Weber.

22:47.456 --> 22:49.338
It was in my fifth or sixth book.

22:49.858 --> 22:51.480
He said, you know, you've got a real oeuvre here.

22:51.861 --> 22:54.063
I said, first I wanted to deny it.

22:54.083 --> 22:55.585
Then I began to realize that he was right.

22:56.766 --> 22:59.329
If I look back on my ten books,

23:00.085 --> 23:13.532
and I'm sure you're well aware of some of the themes and obsessions that come through, you don't begin a career saying, you know, I'm going to write a bunch of novels, and these are my themes, and these are my obsessions, and this is what I'm going to say.

23:13.552 --> 23:14.173
It evolves.

23:14.815 --> 23:16.558
And it's one of the...

23:16.538 --> 23:31.459
One of the magical things about producing each story or each novel is to see where it's going to take me and what that says about me, about my society, how I feel about life, the universe, the lack of meaning, the meaning that we can find, whatever.

23:31.878 --> 23:34.581
I'm still looking for it in each book.

23:34.601 --> 23:36.062
Is it serendipitous?

23:37.123 --> 23:37.844
To a degree.

23:38.285 --> 23:40.807
But, you know, everything is still linked.

23:40.827 --> 23:43.370
If you look at all the books, they are linked very closely.

23:44.111 --> 23:49.716
Thematically and through the repeated obsessions and characterizations, types of humor.

23:50.337 --> 23:52.019
I don't know.

23:52.119 --> 23:54.922
I just want to work into the future to see what happens next.

23:55.703 --> 23:58.205
It's a very legally written book, I think.

23:58.225 --> 23:59.927
I mean, this could very easily...

24:00.346 --> 24:06.995
Well, again, a lot of people are attacking me because my last book was made into a movie.

24:07.615 --> 24:08.637
They don't know anything about me.

24:08.657 --> 24:10.099
They've never read any of my other books.

24:10.239 --> 24:12.382
They don't know that I've never had anything to do with Hollywood.

24:12.982 --> 24:16.527
And they say, well, he's just writing a book to exploit an issue to get a movie sale.

24:16.807 --> 24:20.012
Which, as you know, couldn't be farther from the truth.

24:20.032 --> 24:21.513
How do you respond to that?

24:22.695 --> 24:24.798
Well, I think they're speaking out of ignorance.

24:24.838 --> 24:27.862
This is the third book I've written on the topic of racism.

24:27.882 --> 24:29.644
I'm just trying to work it out here.

24:30.046 --> 24:33.589
I had nothing to do with Alan Corker's movie of Warville.

24:33.609 --> 24:36.312
Of course, I did sell the rights, and I didn't have to do that.

24:37.012 --> 24:42.237
I thought he did a good job, but I didn't have anything to do with it, and I will never have anything to do with anybody's movie.

24:42.878 --> 24:51.606
If they make a movie good, as you know, and I think we've discussed before, I see a movie as a marketing tool for my book to get it out to more people.

24:51.626 --> 24:52.767
That's why I like movies.

24:53.448 --> 24:56.691
And, of course, my daughter needs orthodontia, and I do need money, you know.

24:56.711 --> 24:59.293
Can I tell you how many authors I interviewed?

24:59.813 --> 25:05.408
And I asked the question, and my favorite answer is George Higgins.

25:05.549 --> 25:07.955
He said, well, I sold it.

25:07.995 --> 25:08.617
I sold it.

25:08.637 --> 25:12.608
And when the check cleared the bank, it was there.

25:12.757 --> 25:15.501
I agree.

25:15.602 --> 25:17.765
I couldn't agree more.

25:17.785 --> 25:20.610
I couldn't agree more.

25:20.750 --> 25:23.594
That's my life's work is on the show.

25:23.635 --> 25:35.153
That's a healthy attitude because you see the authors who are so frustrated with Hollywood are ones who feel that this is their baby and they're going to have control.

25:35.639 --> 25:39.545
It really screws up the book and the final analysis, I think, to the author.

25:39.985 --> 25:42.289
Yes, it's trying to... I would never go back.

25:42.489 --> 25:43.330
I don't want to go back.

25:43.390 --> 25:44.572
It's another reason.

25:44.592 --> 25:45.894
I don't want to collaborate with anyone.

25:45.974 --> 25:47.156
I don't want a loss of control.

25:47.216 --> 25:49.980
And I wouldn't want to go back and try to... This is it.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.323
I mean, I don't just throw this stuff out casually.

25:52.363 --> 25:53.505
This is it.

25:54.166 --> 25:54.466
You know?

25:54.646 --> 25:57.490
This is interesting.

25:57.671 --> 26:00.094
I don't mind my talking to another author.

26:00.114 --> 26:05.562
I wouldn't get work that's doing in my piece, but Tim O'Brien right now, for instance, is going back.

26:06.065 --> 26:10.011
He's going over Cacciato, he's going over... Why?

26:10.091 --> 26:11.434
Why?

26:11.454 --> 26:12.095
Why is that?

26:12.115 --> 26:20.728
He said, I have a responsibility to produce the best possible work of mine, but I said, but Tim, that's completed work from 20 years ago.

26:20.748 --> 26:24.234
Everyone has their own take, and I would not presume to criticize him.

26:24.294 --> 26:26.578
I admire his work, particularly the things they carried.

26:26.638 --> 26:28.140
I think it's a brilliant, brilliant book.

26:28.593 --> 26:31.637
Personally, I wouldn't feel that that's a healthy attitude.

26:33.540 --> 26:38.547
There are things that I might change in the early stories because the language is so wild.

26:39.649 --> 26:40.730
But I wouldn't want to.

26:40.770 --> 26:42.713
That's an historical thing.

26:42.753 --> 26:43.595
That was me then.

26:43.955 --> 26:44.556
It stands.

26:44.876 --> 26:50.605
When I did the collected stories in England and eventually someday when I do collected stories here, every note will be the same.

26:50.725 --> 26:51.586
I'm not going to change it.

26:51.646 --> 26:56.473
I think, in a way, I owe it to the public to let them see what it was like originally.

26:56.791 --> 27:10.767
My idea of being an artist is not to obsess about what I may have failed out in the past, but to try to figure out who I am tomorrow, to have a reason to get up and try to explore this world and find out what I feel about things.

27:11.588 --> 27:16.253
I have to go forward, which is one of the reasons I think lab produced so much work.

27:16.333 --> 27:17.675
I have to go forward.

27:17.935 --> 27:19.957
You know, if I'm not working, I feel like shit.

27:20.658 --> 27:21.579
I feel like shit now.

27:22.020 --> 27:25.684
I've got a book to write, and it's going to be three months before I can start it.

27:26.356 --> 27:28.159
Can I have some ketchup, please?

27:28.179 --> 27:30.542
This is the one you'll be going to Madison for.

27:30.783 --> 27:31.183
Yeah.

27:31.884 --> 27:39.737
Now, Ben, I was there for about a week with my wife, who loves libraries, and she helped me enormously with this research.

27:39.817 --> 27:41.479
Make sure you get a copy of that book.

27:41.519 --> 27:43.643
It's all about library formation.

27:44.284 --> 27:46.547
Oh, right up my alley.

27:46.647 --> 27:49.191
That's interesting.

27:49.593 --> 27:59.826
I like to think of it as a fable.

27:59.866 --> 28:03.851
You know, it takes off, obviously, from Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath.

28:03.871 --> 28:05.633
I mean, that was the inspiration for it.

28:05.673 --> 28:10.179
I'm trying to reevaluate his ethos from 1939.

28:10.279 --> 28:11.761
I'm not trying to rewrite Steinbeck.

28:11.821 --> 28:13.222
I'm not trying to challenge Steinbeck.

28:13.683 --> 28:15.505
I'm just thinking about his ethos.

28:15.645 --> 28:16.967
I love the Grapes of Wrath.

28:17.588 --> 28:23.998
You know, in 1939, we had police blocking the borders of California to keep out American citizens who wanted to migrate there.

28:24.578 --> 28:31.148
Now we have police blocking the borders to keep out non-American citizens who want to migrate there.

28:31.449 --> 28:38.760
I wonder how that stacks up, though, because in Standex Day, there were not 5.5 billion people on the earth.

28:39.941 --> 28:43.647
And yes, of course, we can all say we'll reach down a hand to the downtrodden.

28:44.082 --> 28:50.990
But how does that operate in 1995 in a world of dwindling resources, in a world where people really are the enemy?

28:51.791 --> 28:53.834
It's no accident that Delaney is a naturalist.

28:54.695 --> 28:58.519
Naturalists and ecologists, for the most part, are liberals across the board.

28:58.820 --> 29:03.926
But in this one issue of immigration, they are totally reactionary because who is the enemy?

29:04.126 --> 29:04.447
People.

29:04.787 --> 29:06.549
And then they tend to demonize people.

29:06.629 --> 29:07.370
People are worthless.

29:07.390 --> 29:08.892
They're the ones throwing garbage in the woods.

29:09.212 --> 29:13.077
They're the ones, condito, eating the last canyon wrench to survive.

29:13.445 --> 29:20.794
Delaney thinks, what is the value of a human life as opposed, let's say, to this carrion bird, the condor, of which there are only 72?

29:21.215 --> 29:24.218
And I think that's my object.

29:24.238 --> 29:26.881
You know, I've always been Darwinian from Descent of Man on.

29:27.322 --> 29:28.163
How does that play?

29:28.403 --> 29:30.266
How does Steinbeck's ethos play now?

29:31.107 --> 29:37.254
And if I think of it as a fable, it's more like I'm thinking of something like The Wayward Bus, for instance.

29:38.035 --> 29:39.837
I've stripped the language back to a degree.

29:40.318 --> 29:42.000
I've given you four points of view.

29:42.436 --> 30:05.507
uh i don't present the answers but i think you know where i stand and i think that that last line should grab you take it 10 minutes past the last line for delaney sitting on that roof in the rain maybe he'll reevaluate a little bit you know maybe part of this one of the delicious aspects of the satire is that he is a naturalist

30:06.314 --> 30:11.844
I think in the wider scope of satire, did you set out to like this bit?

30:11.924 --> 30:15.069
Did you see it from the outset as a satire?

30:15.510 --> 30:22.743
I did, but you see, the tone sort of changes as we go on.

30:22.823 --> 30:23.925
It evolved this way.

30:24.606 --> 30:31.478
The kind of satire that I like best, and we may have said this in past interviews, derives from...

30:31.846 --> 30:34.450
I kind of take that Flannery O'Connor had on things.

30:34.490 --> 30:35.872
She was very important to me.

30:35.912 --> 30:38.396
I read her when I was a college student and just beginning to write.

30:39.578 --> 30:42.302
You catch the audience off guard.

30:43.123 --> 30:45.467
They feel there's going to be a humorous satire.

30:46.188 --> 30:49.453
Although in this book, I think right from the outset, you know it's going to be very dark.

30:50.394 --> 30:52.678
And it turns on you gradually.

30:52.698 --> 30:54.240
You're not even aware of when it turns.

30:54.421 --> 30:57.726
But when it does, it takes that laughter and makes it catch in your throat.

30:58.687 --> 30:59.929
And it makes you feel bad.

31:00.415 --> 31:03.918
That's what I'm after here, you know?

31:04.539 --> 31:11.246
I realized at some point that my instincts are to make it a flat-out comedy, make fun of everybody and everything.

31:11.286 --> 31:12.487
This is different.

31:13.348 --> 31:15.550
This has to have some kind of moral center.

31:16.111 --> 31:23.818
It's got to give a voice and a face to the guys selling the oranges on the street that we drive by every day, and all the laborers lined up for work.

31:23.838 --> 31:26.541
I wanted them to be represented.

31:26.926 --> 31:31.876
And maybe if I'm harder on Delaney and Cairo than I am on Candido, it's because I know them better.

31:32.197 --> 31:35.324
And I think that their behavior needs correcting.

31:35.464 --> 31:36.045
They're my neighbors.

31:36.105 --> 31:38.891
And their behavior needs examination and maybe correcting.

31:38.931 --> 31:40.154
I'm not preaching.

31:40.595 --> 31:41.577
I'm just saying maybe.

31:41.860 --> 31:43.322
You judge for yourself.

31:45.624 --> 31:47.046
So I think the book does evolve.

31:47.106 --> 31:48.868
Again, I don't know what I'm going to say.

31:48.888 --> 31:53.553
I write a book in order to sort out my feelings and let it grow, let it evolve, see what happens day by day.

31:53.773 --> 31:55.815
The humor, of course, is organic, too.

31:55.995 --> 31:57.577
I don't think you can try to be funny.

31:58.118 --> 31:59.339
That's my approach to life.

31:59.399 --> 32:02.923
It always has been a kind of absurdist view of things.

32:02.943 --> 32:09.029
And I love inhuman conversation just to draw it on things.

32:09.590 --> 32:10.551
I can't help it.

32:10.767 --> 32:16.415
Because if you try to summarize this and to say what's funny, you blow it because you lose the context.

32:16.555 --> 32:24.887
And I think a lot of this comes out of... To go back to the visual aspects, and I didn't mean to suggest that you were writing this for the screen, but do you write visually?

32:25.168 --> 32:28.873
Do you actually see your characters?

32:28.893 --> 32:29.093
Sure.

32:29.194 --> 32:33.840
You know, I'm the first of the TV generation.

32:33.860 --> 32:36.164
When I was a kid, I watched TV all day and all night.

32:36.344 --> 32:37.666
I didn't read books.

32:37.686 --> 32:38.547
I didn't read books.

32:39.590 --> 32:44.895
I think it's inevitable that in this age, writers visualize things.

32:45.416 --> 32:51.281
In words, yes, but visualize them in a way that maybe past generations didn't.

32:51.301 --> 32:55.285
We might not spend as much time with the description as the Victorian novelists did.

32:55.305 --> 32:58.729
For instance, every character's face is described in detail in a Victorian novel.

32:59.149 --> 33:01.051
Every aspect of this room would be described.

33:01.071 --> 33:02.813
Every cup, every saucer, everything.

33:03.153 --> 33:06.396
Maybe we do that in shorthand.

33:06.416 --> 33:08.398
But I think...

33:09.121 --> 33:11.604
The movement of my stories is always very visual.

33:12.766 --> 33:16.211
The imagery of what you see and how you set the scene is always visual.

33:16.231 --> 33:19.976
And I think that comes from the fact that we grew up on TV and on movies.

33:20.136 --> 33:28.748
I think, to go back to the earlier question of the hard work part and the creative part, I think making it visual probably comes from the hard work part.

33:28.768 --> 33:37.440
You know, I mean, after you've written, I don't know, maybe a model of that, but I think that was going line by line

33:37.673 --> 33:42.239
It comes natural.

33:43.120 --> 33:46.425
But it is hard work, and it's revised over and over and over.

33:47.326 --> 33:49.028
You know, I complained about critics earlier.

33:49.489 --> 33:50.590
But there's nice things, too.

33:50.671 --> 33:57.640
And one guy, a columnist, writing about Wellville, not a book guy, but a columnist, said...

33:58.312 --> 34:07.985
said that this is very funny, and it looks totally effortless, which means the author busted his arm right in it, and the guy is exactly right.

34:08.126 --> 34:08.706
That's right.

34:09.027 --> 34:16.878
The idea is to make them look easy.

34:16.898 --> 34:19.982
One of the critics I love says,

34:23.371 --> 34:30.293
It's like he made the revelation that you were doing a copy of Annie Dillard, and you tell him straight away.

34:30.813 --> 34:36.578
Again, that was difficult for me because I love Annie Dillard.

34:37.659 --> 34:42.424
I didn't want to do a really outrageous parody because it wouldn't be credible.

34:42.804 --> 34:45.146
You have to believe that Delaney actually wrote this.

34:46.628 --> 34:54.876
I had to rein in that, too, because my instinct is to make it a flat-out parody where you read it and you fall on the floor laughing.

34:54.916 --> 34:57.638
I had to rein it in so you could believe that Delaney wrote it.

34:58.099 --> 34:59.520
Delaney is this guy who...

34:59.838 --> 35:03.303
You know, in the many, many ironies of the book, he's got the $300 sleeping bag.

35:03.324 --> 35:05.046
He goes out to hear the coyotes howl.

35:06.048 --> 35:12.979
The next scene, you see Condito, you know, living in the bushes because he's got no choice with no shower and no toilet or anything else.

35:12.999 --> 35:14.962
And dying virtually.

35:14.982 --> 35:15.783
And it went over.

35:15.984 --> 35:17.366
And dying.

35:17.506 --> 35:18.167
Yeah.

35:19.666 --> 35:22.711
You talk about the name of America.

35:22.811 --> 35:25.976
I mean, you talk about an ironic name for a Catholic, too.

35:26.877 --> 35:27.959
But it is a common name.

35:28.340 --> 35:29.061
A common name.

35:29.081 --> 35:34.229
You know, we think that we possess the name America, but we don't.

35:35.030 --> 35:37.434
Yeah, no, I mean, I choose, and Condi, though.

35:37.635 --> 35:40.018
And the name of Condi, though, you know, like Voltaire's Condi.

35:40.038 --> 35:43.083
This is the guy who has every pile of shit upon him.

35:43.143 --> 35:43.564
And again,

35:43.747 --> 35:53.876
If you see it as a fable, sure, most Mexicans coming across the border, and even Guatemalans and people from Latin America, Central America, really have a community to go to.

35:54.396 --> 36:00.201
And they may live in very poor conditions, but they often have relatives, villagers, and they're absorbed.

36:00.962 --> 36:07.047
I could have written about them, but in terms of a fable, I want the highest contrast that I can get.

36:07.787 --> 36:10.269
And it is true that many people do live in the bushes.

36:10.470 --> 36:11.991
I hiked back in Topanga Canyon.

36:12.011 --> 36:13.332
I lived there for 10 years.

36:13.835 --> 36:15.961
in Woodland Hills, over at Crankham.

36:17.365 --> 36:18.128
People are living there.

36:18.148 --> 36:22.079
You see the sleeping bags in the dirt where they're out lined up for work, you know.

36:23.343 --> 36:27.034
I wanted to write about the most extreme example, obviously for the ironic

36:27.436 --> 36:30.720
collision of these two types of life.

36:31.100 --> 36:44.817
To go back to this concept of a California problem, what do you say to the rest of America, people who all they know about California is what they see on television?

36:45.998 --> 36:51.925
I say we're in big trouble, big, big trouble, ecologically especially.

36:52.630 --> 37:01.641
and also if you extend ecologic problems to the fact that we are one species, which I want to remind the reader of, we are all one species.

37:02.622 --> 37:19.161
Nonetheless, despite tribalism and race, animal species are going to migrate according to conditions, and those may be economic conditions, those may be conditions where you get resources, and of course Delaney makes this parallel in his columns.

37:19.580 --> 37:25.406
The idea of a sovereign country is breaking down.

37:26.868 --> 37:31.332
I think we're getting more and more factionalism.

37:31.432 --> 37:32.894
I think we're getting out of control.

37:33.655 --> 37:35.036
I don't like it.

37:35.056 --> 37:40.402
I don't like demonizing any class of people or race of people.

37:41.003 --> 37:45.027
Yes, I suppose immigrants will be absorbed just as they were in the past.

37:45.047 --> 37:46.228
In the book I'm doing now,

37:46.563 --> 37:48.746
reading through the papers of this family.

37:49.107 --> 37:51.490
The wife was complaining because the gardener didn't speak English.

37:51.630 --> 37:52.211
This is 1920.

37:52.371 --> 37:54.835
I assumed immediately Mexican.

37:54.915 --> 37:58.440
No, there were no Mexicans in Santa Barbara, which is about 50% Hispanic now.

37:58.780 --> 37:59.401
The Italians.

37:59.882 --> 38:04.829
All the Italians were brought to California at that point to run the vineyards and be stonemasons for the big estates.

38:05.570 --> 38:05.910
Really?

38:06.812 --> 38:08.494
We do get absorbed eventually.

38:08.995 --> 38:14.983
However, it seems to me that the population pressures of the world are just...

38:15.183 --> 38:18.030
beyond hope, beyond hope or redemption at this point.

38:18.250 --> 38:26.710
You know, on the other side of the coin, in terms of being a sovereign country, Mexico is a very corrupt government.

38:26.730 --> 38:31.842
It's a one-party system and has been since the revolution in 1916 and on.

38:32.378 --> 38:40.054
The previous government and the previous generation advocated big families.

38:41.417 --> 38:45.325
We now have one million people per year coming into the job force in Mexico.

38:45.625 --> 38:48.047
which has a chronic 40% unemployment.

38:48.267 --> 38:51.010
The wage per day, if you get a job, is $3 a day.

38:52.051 --> 38:55.114
You cross the border, you might starve.

38:55.334 --> 38:56.315
You might live in the bushes.

38:56.515 --> 38:58.697
But if you get a job, you're going to make $3 an hour.

39:01.119 --> 39:01.720
What would you do?

39:01.760 --> 39:11.048
When I started this book, I've been to Mexico many, many times in the past and traveled through it.

39:11.348 --> 39:12.409
But I hadn't been for a while.

39:12.850 --> 39:15.312
And I went back to Tijuana just for a day.

39:16.540 --> 39:25.504
to go walk along the fence, just walk along the fence all the way down to the Pais on the beaches, just to look at it and talk to some people.

39:26.007 --> 39:32.596
Oh, you got guys, you know, old, standing there with a little spring bag with their shit in it, waiting for dark to come.

39:33.037 --> 39:40.968
And meanwhile, on the other side, all of the agents are looking very suspiciously at you because you're on the other side of the fence.

39:40.988 --> 39:43.131
Like maybe you got a country on the other side.

39:43.692 --> 39:46.015
Yeah, or maybe I'm a coyote or something.

39:46.155 --> 39:51.643
And it is true that from my reading, I don't know this from fact, but I mean from experience,

39:52.028 --> 39:56.136
that there are many gangs on both sides of the border to prey on these poor people.

39:56.977 --> 40:04.170
We don't think of the Mexicans' racism and intolerance either in this, but they are, we are very humane in this country.

40:04.611 --> 40:06.274
The Mexicans dealing with

40:06.490 --> 40:11.857
the immigrants coming through the south of Mexico to America from Guatemala, Salvador, etc.

40:11.877 --> 40:19.207
They are vicious to these people, you know, beyond what you could dream of.

40:19.367 --> 40:30.962
This is hot tea.

40:31.263 --> 40:49.328
I enjoy this interview because we've talked about some far-ranging things.

40:49.348 --> 40:56.798
A lot of people are only interested in the politics of the book.

40:57.014 --> 40:59.959
But the politics of this book are a starting point for me.

41:00.701 --> 41:06.170
And then it becomes a work of art, you know, an expression of what I feel.

41:06.311 --> 41:10.458
And I would rather talk about that than talk about the issues.

41:11.159 --> 41:13.624
I don't want to talk about Proposition 87.

41:13.704 --> 41:15.407
I don't want to be co-opted by the other side.

41:15.487 --> 41:17.250
Boyle said this or Boyle said that.

41:17.517 --> 41:32.893
I want people to read the book and think for themselves.

41:33.346 --> 41:41.154
other spaced out hippies would say to me, man, you ought to really meditate, you know?

41:41.515 --> 41:46.079
And I pointed out to them, I do meditate every day for about four or five hours at the typewriter.

41:46.239 --> 41:53.747
And if it is fun, it's a way of, some days, you're a writer, you know, some days you never get loose of the conscious mind.

41:54.328 --> 41:55.169
You just can't shake it.

41:55.189 --> 41:57.411
You got problems, whatever, you can't shake it.

41:58.152 --> 42:00.214
But mostly, at some point,

42:00.768 --> 42:04.832
You do lose track of where you are, who you are, and what you're doing.

42:04.912 --> 42:06.153
And that's the magic of it.

42:06.173 --> 42:06.874
That's great.

42:06.894 --> 42:09.116
That's when you enter it.

42:09.136 --> 42:11.219
I remember that story with John Keegan.

42:12.059 --> 42:13.541
Have you ever read any of his stuff?

42:13.561 --> 42:13.761
No.

42:14.342 --> 42:17.645
The face of battle and all that?

42:17.665 --> 42:19.967
No, I don't know.

42:19.987 --> 42:22.890
The face of battle is a classic.

42:23.071 --> 42:27.535
I remember him saying that he said about 14 books.

42:27.515 --> 42:30.440
He said, when he wrote that book, he did get a zoom.

42:30.460 --> 42:31.221
It's almost like that.

42:31.662 --> 42:33.305
And I felt the same way.

42:33.325 --> 42:34.787
I remember there were 14 months.

42:35.048 --> 42:36.851
I can tell you I know I lived.

42:36.871 --> 42:39.435
I went to sleep at night.

42:40.036 --> 42:41.959
Well, you see the excitement of it.

42:42.520 --> 42:48.290
And particularly in creative work, we talked earlier, the excitement is, how does it come together?

42:48.350 --> 42:52.898
I think more and more that a book is a puzzle for the author.

42:53.148 --> 42:55.972
Why did I start with this character and this voice?

42:56.152 --> 42:59.798
Why did I lay down these certain symbols in the first couple of chapters?

43:00.198 --> 43:04.344
Well, the resolution of that will take 350 pages, and I'm going to find out.

43:04.685 --> 43:07.208
And at a certain point toward the end, you begin to find out.

43:07.729 --> 43:08.951
And then you work day and night.

43:08.971 --> 43:14.599
You're in a creative frenzy, and you have tremendous joy and satisfaction in finishing it.

43:14.579 --> 43:33.803
and making it just right of course i last about 10 seconds and you think holy shit what am i going to do next so it is something of an epiphanous process for you absolutely making discoveries along the way absolutely do you start with the voice the character of a other concept

43:33.783 --> 43:39.851
Good question.

43:39.871 --> 43:40.732
More and more now.

43:40.933 --> 43:44.858
I think in the earlier stories I was more interested in form.

43:46.080 --> 43:48.903
Form and maybe a concept.

43:49.164 --> 43:51.066
I'm less interested in character.

43:51.206 --> 43:54.891
Now I think there's a better balance between all three in my work.

43:54.911 --> 43:59.518
And I think to answer the question, probably I begin with a voice.

44:00.659 --> 44:02.001
That's a certain point.

44:02.437 --> 44:07.547
whether it's going to be an eye narrator or a third person, and what the tone will be like.

44:07.888 --> 44:09.611
I think that's what starts it now.

44:09.631 --> 44:11.094
So whose voice started this?

44:12.277 --> 44:16.505
Well, I knew that I would want to do a third person.

44:16.785 --> 44:19.491
I've only done one novel in the first person.

44:19.511 --> 44:22.116
That's certainly the character who is speaking to you, though.

44:22.096 --> 44:43.395
not in this you see it's in delaney's mind to open up with yes okay so it is his not his voice exactly it's mine but it's very very strongly from his point of view it's such a close third person that it's almost like a first person but that allows me then to enter all four of the characters and this new novel will also be in a third person it gives me the freedom

44:43.612 --> 45:12.589
with language if it's a first person it sometimes has to be limited to the range of what that character could credibly say and think and write like but if it's in third person i can be me and and do anything i want with language and in this one of course the language is simpler the next one though i'll be i think i'm going to return to a much more um wild sort of portrayal of things do you have a sense of who your reader is when you're in

45:12.890 --> 45:19.717
No, I have no idea who my reader is, and I'm always amazed at the book signings to find out who they are.

45:19.797 --> 45:21.079
It's pretty much everybody.

45:21.139 --> 45:28.567
Mostly my audience has been younger college students, high school students, I mean, proportionately.

45:29.327 --> 45:33.812
But this book, I'm finding for the first time, I have a tremendous female readership for this book.

45:34.613 --> 45:39.218
And experts in the field, that is females, have told me the reason is

45:39.620 --> 45:46.115
that they felt that I got into the heads of the female characters and portrayed them realistically and synthetically.

45:46.738 --> 45:47.824
And that to me

45:48.192 --> 45:52.497
is a wonderful compliment because I've always... I think so.

45:52.717 --> 45:54.319
I've always tried to do that.

45:54.419 --> 45:57.002
And, you know, I joke with them at the bookstores about this.

45:57.082 --> 46:03.570
I said, well, you know, I've lived with a woman for 25 years now, and maybe I'm starting to get a handle on it.

46:03.690 --> 46:07.454
I've lived in a house entirely with women.

46:07.474 --> 46:11.339
I have two daughters, Elaine Clark Gisley, and a female black lab.

46:11.719 --> 46:13.161
Wow.

46:13.601 --> 46:14.402
But, of course,

46:14.787 --> 46:15.688
You're their slave.

46:15.969 --> 46:17.110
You're their full-time slave.

46:17.271 --> 46:19.013
Well, maybe.

46:19.654 --> 46:20.956
Well, I am.

46:20.976 --> 46:23.099
I'm certainly the full-time slave of my family.

46:26.264 --> 46:30.330
You mentioned in one of the interviews, I think, with Loba, that writers are kill maniacs.

46:30.911 --> 46:31.752
I like that.

46:32.353 --> 46:32.914
That's for sure.

46:32.994 --> 46:34.076
That's something you want to keep.

46:34.777 --> 46:41.166
I'm foremost among them, and I think that's another reason why I come in for such abuse and criticism, because they prioritize people.

46:41.855 --> 46:47.583
But I'm totally... Nothing happens in a vacuum.

46:47.723 --> 46:49.586
Yeah, I'm totally confident in what I do.

46:49.626 --> 46:50.167
I don't care.

46:50.227 --> 46:52.089
I mean, I have my own vision.

46:53.191 --> 47:05.348
And if I have a goal beyond an aesthetic goal, it's to force literature, that is my literature,

47:06.138 --> 47:11.787
in the arena of all the popular writing that's out there, without any compromise, doing exactly as I want.

47:11.867 --> 47:13.730
But then, that's why I go on the 30-city tour.

47:14.431 --> 47:18.818
And each six-month reporting period, each of my books sells more.

47:19.339 --> 47:23.205
I'm not talking Michael Crichton here, but each sells more each six months.

47:23.846 --> 47:29.235
Since 79, when The Center of Man came out, my books have all been in print consistently.

47:29.255 --> 47:30.677
And each time I go out on the road,

47:31.282 --> 47:34.027
People buy the paperbacks, they see me, they hear about me.

47:34.689 --> 47:36.051
That's very rewarding for me.

47:36.512 --> 47:37.694
I would like that to continue.

47:37.915 --> 47:45.309
I don't understand why when I walk on the airplane and take a pee and walk up the aisle and see hundreds of people reading, they're all reading John Grisham instead of me.

47:45.649 --> 47:48.515
I mean, ten of them could be reading me, couldn't they?

47:48.535 --> 47:49.236
Two would be nice.

47:49.276 --> 47:51.180
I don't think that's an unreasonable goal.

47:51.565 --> 47:54.350
You've got to keep working at it.

47:54.430 --> 47:55.973
Keep working at it, but in your own terms.

47:55.993 --> 48:06.112
You see, if you were to, say, calculate something and say, all right, you know, I write about this athlete who kills his wife in L.A., you know, then you're a hack.

48:07.395 --> 48:09.118
If you do exactly what you would do,

48:09.385 --> 48:13.330
And it's an act of seduction, writing pictures.

48:13.350 --> 48:15.673
You seduce the reader into your point of view.

48:16.154 --> 48:20.159
And I think I have no problem with going out on the road and seducing an audience to my point of view.

48:20.699 --> 48:34.397
I admire that so much because so many authors who I interviewed, you know, 50 years ago, once they seem to reach a certain level of commercial success,

48:35.390 --> 48:40.154
You can't buy anything.

48:40.454 --> 48:46.500
We have more to combat now than we did 15 years ago in terms of popular culture and its fragmentation.

48:46.520 --> 48:49.803
You remember there used to be general interest magazines like The Atlantic and Harper's?

48:49.823 --> 48:51.785
We could all read them and have some common ground.

48:53.086 --> 48:55.928
That doesn't exist anymore, or it exists at a very small level.

48:56.148 --> 48:57.109
There's Runner magazine.

48:57.169 --> 48:58.250
There's PC magazine.

48:59.091 --> 49:00.192
Everything is fragmented.

49:01.173 --> 49:03.675
What's the glue that's going to hold this all together?

49:04.043 --> 49:06.868
You mentioned that each book has done better than the previous one.

49:06.908 --> 49:11.477
What is, just out of curiosity, what's happening in terms of the numbers?

49:11.497 --> 49:14.683
Well, this has been my best selling off out of the chute.

49:16.706 --> 49:18.610
They announced the first printing of $100,000.

49:20.073 --> 49:22.838
We now have, but they always hedge the debts, of course.

49:22.978 --> 49:26.424
We now have $60,000 in franchise.

49:27.086 --> 49:27.807
That's right.

49:28.360 --> 49:33.494
It's 14 on the Ingram list, which means that it's being reordered heavily.

49:33.795 --> 49:34.357
That's great.

49:34.377 --> 49:35.821
So I have high hopes for it.

49:35.921 --> 49:39.872
I think more than any of my books, this is a word of mouth book.

49:40.325 --> 49:47.096
I told Paul not to do... I told Paul that I didn't want to do the late-night comedy shows on TV again.

49:47.537 --> 49:54.368
I wanted to do more of the talk shows that are geared towards politics and issues and so on.

49:54.628 --> 49:57.733
But I think that's what this book can appeal to.

49:57.793 --> 49:59.236
That audience, it should appeal to.

49:59.256 --> 50:03.042
I have high hopes for it in terms of getting the...

50:03.646 --> 50:07.352
a larger audience for the next part.

50:07.492 --> 50:11.538
Perfect for my column.

50:11.598 --> 50:18.549
The fact that I mindfully target university towns, state capitals.

50:18.889 --> 50:23.136
It just doesn't have to be any tape, by the way.

50:23.176 --> 50:24.117
Say that again.

50:24.458 --> 50:27.683
I love the highly educated audience, the university towns and so on.

50:29.145 --> 50:32.590
But again, I've always felt that good literature

50:33.025 --> 50:34.206
should have wide appeal.

50:34.907 --> 50:36.970
Maybe I'm beating my head against the wall.

50:37.210 --> 50:38.712
Maybe that's not possible anymore.

50:38.752 --> 50:40.775
Maybe we are too fragmented a society.

50:41.716 --> 50:54.552
I still feel that people should discover that some of our books, this one perhaps, are as readable, as much of a page turner as the latest detective novel that's out there.

50:55.032 --> 50:57.936
And yet, it's so much richer than that too.

50:58.186 --> 50:59.808
You know, I want to get that across.

50:59.828 --> 51:02.151
I don't know if I ever will, but that's what I'm trying to do.

51:02.352 --> 51:08.020
Going down the aisle of the airplane and seeing everybody reading the Christian mark.

51:08.040 --> 51:15.289
It's very important to point out that just because something is literary doesn't mean that you can't enjoy reading it.

51:15.510 --> 51:16.171
Exactly.

51:16.191 --> 51:18.013
Every work of literature doesn't have to be boring.

51:18.354 --> 51:25.864
Again, this is why in my public persona going out before the audience, I'm a charming guy.

51:26.215 --> 51:27.401
There's no pretense.

51:27.441 --> 51:29.331
There's no professorial demeanor.

51:29.392 --> 51:32.830
There's no, you know, hieratic pronunciation of words.

51:32.950 --> 51:33.694
It's just me.

51:33.893 --> 51:35.636
And I love to give a show.

51:35.977 --> 51:37.139
I love to blow them away.

51:37.159 --> 51:38.120
I love to make them laugh.

51:38.200 --> 51:39.683
I love to make them have a good time.

51:39.903 --> 51:46.435
Because they can go out of there and say, yeah, you know, this literature stuff, it's not so bad, you know?

51:46.475 --> 51:55.571
When you're writing a book, which apparently is all the time, and you're teaching, do you kind of share any of this with the students?

51:55.711 --> 51:59.277
Or do you keep your own... Not really, because...

51:59.560 --> 52:04.406
My job is to be their mentor and to help them develop in their own direction.

52:05.267 --> 52:14.258
And at this stage of my career, most of them, almost all of them, all of them, everyone has read my work and know who I am and want to be in my class for that reason.

52:14.518 --> 52:16.401
Are they undergraduates or graduates?

52:16.421 --> 52:20.005
Primarily undergrads, but in the advanced section, anybody can take it.

52:20.025 --> 52:20.666
I don't know who they are.

52:20.686 --> 52:22.388
I read the manuscript, I take the person.

52:22.408 --> 52:25.011
So we have a good mix, but primarily undergrads.

52:25.615 --> 52:29.140
I don't want to impose my aesthetic views on them.

52:29.560 --> 52:40.035
I want to impose all my other views, you know, in terms of developing in your own way, finding your voice, reading literature deeply, all of that.

52:40.135 --> 52:43.179
But I don't want to make them be writers like me.

52:43.660 --> 52:46.223
I want them to be writers like they're going to be.

52:46.591 --> 52:48.733
So I'm very careful to keep my work out of it.

52:48.753 --> 52:51.456
You know, sometimes someone will ask me a question and, of course, I'll answer it.

52:51.496 --> 52:52.558
But basically, no.

52:52.758 --> 52:56.542
I wouldn't presume to impose my work on them.

52:56.562 --> 53:02.669
They can read it just as they would read work by Dennis Johnson or Tim O'Brien or Louise Erdrich or somebody else.

53:03.490 --> 53:07.474
Do you essentially agree with John Brackett that I don't teach words or I coach?

53:07.494 --> 53:09.036
He does himself a coach.

53:09.196 --> 53:11.058
I would subscribe to that 100%.

53:11.078 --> 53:12.480
By the way, I will see.

53:13.203 --> 53:18.009
Mr. Barth for the third time in my life tomorrow night.

53:18.290 --> 53:18.930
He's wonderful.

53:19.351 --> 53:30.025
He's the keynote speaker at a three-day literary seminar at my old alma mater, Potsdam College in New York, of people who are writing about my work.

53:30.906 --> 53:40.138
And it's going to be very interesting and a little intimidating to be there because, sure, I'll go in and say hello to everybody and give my reading and all of that, but I don't think...

53:40.675 --> 53:43.784
I could be in the room when somebody's reading a paper on my work.

53:44.125 --> 53:46.051
I look forward to reading the papers that they write.

53:46.452 --> 53:50.062
But I think I'm going to hide out in my hotel room while the papers are actually being read.

53:50.083 --> 53:53.352
So this is intimidating for you to find your work being...

53:53.602 --> 53:57.106
No, no, no, no, no.

53:57.166 --> 54:00.350
I'm very pleased because, you know, I was a graduate student too.

54:00.650 --> 54:07.479
No, I mean, to be present for the reading of a paper would be very awkward for me and for the person reading a paper.

54:08.340 --> 54:12.144
So I'm going to hide out and read the papers afterwards.

54:12.384 --> 54:15.228
When you do your readings, are there favorite things that you do?

54:15.789 --> 54:16.469
Do it differently?

54:17.010 --> 54:21.195
I like to read new short stories.

54:22.053 --> 54:42.711
uh so last night you didn't read from the i read from the novel uh i brought a new story along and i've read it a couple of times in a theater setting not in a bookstore setting and it was a perfect setting last night we had about 300 people in the boston public library very enthusiastic audience but i felt that i should read from the novel and i'm primarily reading from the novel

54:42.843 --> 54:49.590
because it has been so controversial, and I want to give them a taste of what it is, so they can make up their own minds.

54:49.630 --> 54:51.152
Here the reviews are great.

54:51.232 --> 54:52.453
The reviews are wonderful here.

54:52.874 --> 54:56.858
In some towns, they haven't been wonderful, and I feel that I want to show them what I'm doing.

54:58.460 --> 55:04.286
But I will, in a couple of locations here, when I have a theater situation, I'll read them a news story.

55:04.306 --> 55:06.789
I prefer that because they get a complete show.

55:06.849 --> 55:07.630
They get the whole thing.

55:07.670 --> 55:11.314
It's always hard to select a section of a book to read.

55:12.205 --> 55:15.309
And on many of the tours for books, I haven't read from the book at all.

55:15.349 --> 55:16.691
I've just read stories.

55:16.711 --> 55:24.741
When you're reading, either from finished work or from work in progress, are you ever tempted to change things as you go along?

55:24.761 --> 55:25.743
No.

55:25.763 --> 55:27.465
Well, occasionally, a phrase here and there.

55:27.485 --> 55:32.552
And sometimes I will, for a public reading, cut back a phrase or two just to make it move a little more quickly.

55:32.592 --> 55:33.813
But no, not really.

55:35.075 --> 55:36.036
Once it's done, it's done.

55:36.216 --> 55:39.681
We're talking about certain writers who obsess over fast work.

55:39.897 --> 55:41.320
I do the best I can.

55:41.420 --> 55:47.432
Henry James goes back and intends to write prefaces and finds himself rewriting the work.

55:47.452 --> 55:49.416
No, I don't think I'll ever do that.

55:49.436 --> 55:53.103
As we said earlier, I want it to stand as it was.

55:53.263 --> 55:55.628
It's a part of me at that moment.

55:56.148 --> 55:58.791
I don't think I should change it, but I don't want to.

55:59.151 --> 55:59.972
I really agree with that.

55:59.992 --> 56:01.513
You know, I mean, did I write about it?

56:01.533 --> 56:03.335
Didn't Lydworth change the revival of poetry?

56:04.076 --> 56:07.759
And I'm feeling they made it worse, I think.

56:07.779 --> 56:09.581
Yeah, well, there's that danger, isn't there?

56:09.661 --> 56:10.722
I hadn't thought of that.

56:10.822 --> 56:14.206
But, you know, what we said earlier is my credo on this.

56:14.266 --> 56:14.886
I want to grow.

56:14.946 --> 56:15.827
I want to go forward.

56:15.847 --> 56:16.708
I don't want to go backwards.

56:16.888 --> 56:20.552
I got plenty of stuff now, but I don't want to overstay.

56:20.572 --> 56:22.033
I would like to shoot some pictures of those.

56:22.053 --> 56:25.817
Yeah, let's do that because Paul said we've got to go sometimes.
