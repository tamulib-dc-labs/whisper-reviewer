WEBVTT

00:02.798 --> 00:05.540
So now we're talking with Roger Stoddard at Houghton Library.

00:05.601 --> 00:07.262
I'll just put this about right here.

00:10.025 --> 00:13.648
When I did an interview with Nicholas Barker, let's start with this.

00:13.668 --> 00:14.589
This is very interesting.

00:15.269 --> 00:21.875
We were talking about collecting, institutionalizing things as opposed to going to private collections.

00:21.895 --> 00:32.485
And he said, this is a direct quote, he said, Bill Jackson, who was a very, very great librarian at the Houghton Library at Harvard, once sold the world's most perfect copy of Vaughn's, sound like scintillians,

00:33.022 --> 00:41.853
on the grounds that this was a book too beautiful, too perfect for a public library to own and not to be in a private collector's collection where it would be protected from too much use.

00:42.473 --> 00:45.157
To Robert Taylor of Princeton, New Jersey.

00:45.557 --> 00:49.061
And he did say, he followed me and said it went to Taylor and it went back to Princeton.

00:49.161 --> 00:52.185
Who had given his collection to Princeton.

00:52.205 --> 00:53.827
But did Jackson do that?

00:53.847 --> 00:54.528
Did he say that?

00:54.548 --> 00:58.252
That the copy was too perfect to be, and that's what I'm driving at.

00:58.272 --> 00:58.793
I don't know.

00:59.397 --> 01:07.046
It was a very lovely copy, and it certainly would be a big help to obtaining a good trade or getting a good price for it.

01:07.486 --> 01:13.973
But I used that when I introduced Taylor as a speaker here, when he did a talk on the foibles of a book collector.

01:14.854 --> 01:16.056
It was a beautiful talk.

01:16.116 --> 01:17.658
It was a bibliophilic talk.

01:17.678 --> 01:18.078
I have it.

01:18.098 --> 01:20.140
I think Princeton published it, I think.

01:20.160 --> 01:20.901
Do they?

01:20.921 --> 01:21.642
I wish they did.

01:21.662 --> 01:27.008
I wrote them a card after and recommended that they sponsor him in that talk also.

01:27.646 --> 01:29.809
He was just lovely in one of the last things he did.

01:29.829 --> 01:32.813
He couldn't stand up at that point.

01:32.853 --> 01:40.384
He sat up in the exhibition room and conversed with the audience in a wonderful way, a wonderful sense of humor and all that.

01:40.404 --> 01:49.777
But that's how I introduced him, by reminding him about this stuff.

01:49.797 --> 01:51.139
So I wasn't here then.

01:51.322 --> 01:53.505
I never heard Jackson tell it.

01:53.525 --> 01:57.590
I forget how I discovered it, but that was part of my introduction to Taylor.

01:57.610 --> 02:03.818
But let's throw that out as a... How do you feel about that?

02:03.918 --> 02:19.978
If that, in fact, without using that as a general policy, if you have a perfect copy of a book, of an exceedingly scarce book, how do you feel about this thought that perhaps it shouldn't be in an institution, that perhaps it should be in the hands of a private collector?

02:20.549 --> 02:39.706
Well, I suppose that if we were talking a generation ago, we would say that private collectors are able to pass on books of that sort, maybe great book findings, or fragile modern books, books of the past 150 years, in pristine condition, because they don't.

02:40.787 --> 02:46.552
Collectors tend not to use their books, but to handle them with great care, to make protective cases for them.

02:46.572 --> 02:50.235
They've done that for a couple hundred years.

02:50.637 --> 03:06.936
Perhaps it's part of our responsibility in institutions to not only serve readers with microphones and books that get copied, but with books that get used up.

03:07.217 --> 03:15.306
Just think of the undergraduate using up copy after copy after copy of standard texts and reference books, which we replace with others.

03:16.508 --> 03:20.172
Not only to do that, but perhaps to take very good care

03:20.692 --> 03:28.701
of some great historical documents in manuscript form.

03:28.761 --> 03:38.792
We showed in bibliography class a week or two ago a perfect Elizabethan quarto, untrimmed.

03:40.434 --> 03:49.163
We were talking about formats, the size of the sheet, the size of the book, and we wanted to make the point about what that looked like

03:50.341 --> 03:57.088
So we didn't open it, we showed it as a closed pamphlet, full-size, untrimmed.

03:58.329 --> 04:05.356
And that exists here for that purpose, not to be read, not to be microphones, but just for that purpose.

04:07.078 --> 04:16.467
And there may be an increasing number of books like that, which we will have to designate for that purpose.

04:17.020 --> 04:29.017
It's very hard to get to see a Blake illuminated book here at Harvard, has been for years, because we know that those books have a limited life.

04:29.878 --> 04:34.325
There's so many times you open the fragile leaves, and they break.

04:34.865 --> 04:39.112
You can almost make the comparison with how often you show watercolors in the museum.

04:39.292 --> 04:40.413
It's the same thing.

04:40.433 --> 04:41.675
There's only so many looks.

04:41.916 --> 04:42.977
It's the same thing.

04:43.447 --> 04:53.162
You go to the Portland Art Museum and look at Winslow Homer wash drawings, and there are little cloth covers that you lift up and then replace.

04:53.662 --> 05:00.312
And the light level around you is very low, so that a lot of people are going to get a look at those without using them up.

05:02.295 --> 05:12.711
In a similar way, we resolve to make exhibitions of those black books, and we have adjusted the light level and we have filtered the light in our exhibition cases.

05:13.838 --> 05:18.722
so that we're not going to abuse the colors with our own lights.

05:20.144 --> 05:25.349
And we will publicize to the English and art departments these periodic exhibitions of life.

05:27.430 --> 05:32.015
But if we're going to pass them on to people three generations hence, we've got to be very careful.

05:32.675 --> 05:43.305
Now, this Elizabethan pamphlet you mentioned, the content, though perhaps important, is irrelevant to this particular example of that

05:43.403 --> 05:44.905
And you can find that elsewhere.

05:45.045 --> 05:46.467
You can find it elsewhere.

05:46.607 --> 05:47.689
You can go to another library and use that.

05:48.029 --> 05:48.410
Okay.

05:50.312 --> 05:53.236
Let's, give me a general, why is it so important?

05:53.637 --> 06:08.757
We are sitting in what is arguably, or perhaps even acknowledged to be the finest special collection repository of any institution in the United States, certainly one of the great collections in the world.

06:10.199 --> 06:11.841
Why is it important for great

06:12.226 --> 06:17.012
for an institution, an educational institution, to have special collections.

06:17.513 --> 06:22.459
Give me a general, why do we have these special collections?

06:23.240 --> 06:33.933
We can speak very generally to it, particularly when you get a new institution, an emerging institution in Texas, in Indiana, in Illinois.

06:33.953 --> 06:38.599
I'm wondering what's going to happen now at Emory now that they've got this $500 million of Coca-Cola money.

06:38.639 --> 06:40.501
Are they going to try and build special collections?

06:41.022 --> 06:41.963
But why do we do this?

06:43.040 --> 06:44.362
I commit the resources.

06:44.602 --> 06:47.926
I don't want you to say I know the answer.

06:47.946 --> 06:50.429
It has something to do with the history of the institution.

06:52.091 --> 07:12.237
If your library is largely wiped out in 1764, and you begin seriously repairing it, replacing it, and building again at the turn of the 19th century, and if your faculty is eager to build a library,

07:13.195 --> 07:25.051
including medieval manuscripts, which come in in the teens of the 19th century, and eager to obtain a big U.S.

07:25.071 --> 07:28.155
history collection, the Abraham Collection, 1818.

07:29.617 --> 07:39.490
And to follow that up with science purchases in the 1840s, and then serious rare book purchases and vernacular literature purchases later in the century,

07:40.432 --> 07:52.669
And then at the turn of that century, area study collections, you're filling your libraries with early manuscripts and rare books.

07:54.031 --> 08:02.282
At a certain point, you no longer leave those on the open shelves.

08:02.302 --> 08:06.468
Harvard began by marking them with a red book light as non-circulating.

08:06.488 --> 08:08.110
They were in the library as non-circulating.

08:09.254 --> 08:21.330
And when a book from Washington's library came here, they locked it up in a cupboard, a corporation .

08:21.911 --> 08:34.788
So you go from those kind of century box-like grill front locked cases that they kept in Gore Hall for rare books and manuscripts, to the treasure room in Widener.

08:35.429 --> 08:36.170
Widener was built.

08:36.190 --> 08:38.974
It had a special facility for rare books and manuscripts.

08:40.068 --> 08:52.582
special care and treatment of them before anyone knew anything about light levels and UV and stable humidity and all that sort of thing.

08:52.602 --> 09:00.171
At least there was security and a staff accustomed to do with bibliography and the problems of book history.

09:01.512 --> 09:05.957
Book history and bibliography were taught here from the teens on

09:07.372 --> 09:12.737
If you get interested in that, I've got a little paper that gives an analogy of that.

09:12.897 --> 09:16.060
It's very important for us.

09:16.080 --> 09:36.079
So that by the time Kies Metcalf came to Harvard in the late 1930s and began to deal with the problem of central library building crammed with books and manuscripts, he found that one of the safety valves

09:37.156 --> 10:05.661
in addition to building an undergraduate library , one of the safety valves was to build a special library devoted to rare books and manuscripts so that they would be emphasized, they would be brought to the attention of students and faculty and researchers, and they would be emphasized to those families that have inherited important papers

10:06.535 --> 10:09.579
and important books, and to book collectors.

10:09.599 --> 10:11.761
And that's what happened in 1942.

10:11.781 --> 10:14.925
This library opened, beautiful library, impressed people.

10:15.486 --> 10:20.552
People began to give collections and give papers to the library.

10:20.592 --> 10:34.990
All these New England papers, you know, and Longfellow, and Lowell, and Howells, and all that, you know, this enormous mass of transcendentalist paper.

10:35.341 --> 10:43.132
papers of Luther and Boston clergy, piled in to this building when it was built.

10:43.392 --> 10:44.454
As a direct consequence?

10:44.534 --> 10:50.142
As a sign that rare books and manuscripts were important at Harvard.

10:50.162 --> 11:02.800
At that time, I don't know the figures for circulation, but I suspect that there was not a lot of activity in 1943 or 1944 in this building.

11:03.792 --> 11:09.541
But certainly by the time I came around in the 50s, we were a very busy place.

11:09.942 --> 11:14.849
My question is, can you measure the greatness of an institution by its special collections, by its holdings?

11:15.851 --> 11:16.773
Is there a correlation?

11:16.793 --> 11:17.133
Oh, no.

11:17.434 --> 11:17.974
No, no, no.

11:17.994 --> 11:19.076
Does it attract faculty?

11:19.096 --> 11:20.659
Does it attract scholars?

11:20.679 --> 11:28.411
I think you can measure, I think you could get a notion of the antiquity of an institution by the size of its rare football.

11:29.733 --> 11:31.015
That, I think, is possible.

11:32.176 --> 11:40.949
If you looked around this place and looked at the quality of the collection and their range, you'd say, well, this is not something that we've built in a generation or two or five.

11:41.990 --> 11:51.665
This is something, this is 10 generations that it takes to put together collections of this magnitude and range and quality.

11:51.685 --> 12:00.698
If you are going to be, if you are acknowledged as the finest university in the world, and few can argue with that,

12:02.247 --> 12:06.832
certainly one function of a university is not just to teach, but to attract scholars.

12:08.014 --> 12:18.847
And I would have to think that one of the features that would attract a scholar is the availability of unique, great, special research sources.

12:18.867 --> 12:31.562
Well, Harvard has just attracted Lawrence Buell, a literary transcendentalist, a great scholar who joins the faculty as a senior

12:31.778 --> 12:47.401
and he is an old-time, long-time researcher in this library, although he's been teaching elsewhere.

12:47.421 --> 12:54.812
And he came over yesterday and started to go around the collection with me.

12:55.333 --> 12:59.018
He's thinking particularly in terms of a spring-term seminar,

12:59.943 --> 13:09.734
in which he will deal with the reputation, the changing reputation of authors, particularly in terms of that list.

13:09.754 --> 13:21.147
And that has to do, of course, with the publication of their work and the series in which they are included in the looks of the books and the sizes of the editions.

13:21.167 --> 13:27.874
He's coming to the place where the papers of Benjamin Fields and their successors, Hoden Mifflin, are.

13:28.360 --> 13:33.406
with all the statistics on the production of the books.

13:33.426 --> 13:51.486
He's coming to a place that has the papers of some of the important critics whose works he'll be teaching in their class, and where some of the authors he'll be teaching, some of the papers of the authors he'll be teaching, already found.

13:52.387 --> 13:55.971
And then the books themselves, and sometimes pieces of the libraries of his authors,

13:57.368 --> 14:04.158
And he was just absolutely fascinated to see, in that new context, what was available to him here.

14:04.178 --> 14:11.048
I was able to tell him that we required the papers a little round, a compliment of the Tickner Museum.

14:11.068 --> 14:19.981
He's fascinated by that, because that opens up a whole new set of authors and a whole different proof of books.

14:20.281 --> 14:24.066
Plus the relationship with publishers, too, which is very important.

14:24.086 --> 14:25.148
Yes, but to him, it's

14:25.381 --> 14:27.603
You know, it's the reputation, the changing reputation.

14:27.663 --> 14:30.485
What makes an author or a work a classic?

14:32.747 --> 14:34.109
How is a classic created?

14:35.129 --> 14:37.091
How is it forgotten?

14:37.131 --> 14:38.652
How is it rediscovered?

14:38.672 --> 14:43.116
You know, this kind of thing is what he's going to build this particular seminar around.

14:43.136 --> 14:47.000
And he's got the books here, so that you can look at the books and see what they look like.

14:47.660 --> 14:52.384
And he's got the publisher's papers, and then he's got some of the critics' papers and some of the authors' papers.

14:52.404 --> 14:54.426
And in some cases, manuscripts as well.

14:54.659 --> 14:56.442
Yes, yes.

14:56.462 --> 15:00.928
He was fascinated to learn that John J. Chapman's papers are here.

15:00.948 --> 15:09.461
He knows that Chapman has great potential for development in critical studies and a biography.

15:09.481 --> 15:11.003
He didn't know that.

15:11.023 --> 15:11.584
Now he knows that.

15:11.644 --> 15:17.814
Perhaps we'll see a doctoral dissertation directed by Professor Gould on some aspect of Chapman.

15:17.834 --> 15:24.143
But that's an example, one little example of what these resources mean.

15:24.663 --> 15:51.126
Switching gears here, a year ago, it's going to be like almost a year ago today, which is very funny, you had mentioned that one question that you'd be interested in seeing pursued, and you mentioned no names, not so much, what interests you is not so much what drives people to collect, but you'd be interested equally in finding out what prompts people to stop collecting.

15:51.865 --> 16:02.302
And I went away, and we talked about maybe some guy down in Rhode Island who collected Shakespeare, and perhaps he was getting blown away by Folger at every turn.

16:02.823 --> 16:07.411
But then I thought, the great example is Arthur Hogan.

16:07.431 --> 16:09.334
What prompted him to stop collecting?

16:09.634 --> 16:13.321
And then, of course, he passed away before I had a chance to... Oh, it's too bad.

16:13.501 --> 16:16.005
I don't think he would have talked to me anyway.

16:16.125 --> 16:17.788
Oh, I think I would.

16:18.427 --> 16:25.113
If his help had provided it when you were asking, I'm sure he would, because he's interested in that kind of thing.

16:26.995 --> 16:28.516
Do you have a sense of that?

16:28.977 --> 16:29.918
Harrison Horvath was another.

16:30.078 --> 16:31.980
But he kept a few things, though, didn't he?

16:32.941 --> 16:38.085
But he stopped collecting books, and he started collecting photographs.

16:38.105 --> 16:40.428
And you can't say that he ever stopped collecting.

16:40.648 --> 16:44.071
He was always collecting something, but it switched.

16:44.091 --> 16:45.092
And at one moment, he

16:45.511 --> 16:50.017
really stopped collecting History of Science, which was his big first love, History of Science.

16:50.237 --> 16:51.278
Which was a great collection.

16:52.660 --> 17:01.952
And Arthur Hogan had stopped collecting, and then decided to sell his collection.

17:01.972 --> 17:12.345
And I don't know, I know that he was having trouble with his eyesight, and that probably inhibited him from

17:12.680 --> 17:16.625
collecting and being very interested in his collection at one point.

17:17.306 --> 17:22.091
But I think that he was able to mend his eyesight.

17:22.112 --> 17:26.857
I think that he got back to the sight that he had lost.

17:26.877 --> 17:27.738
I can explain it.

17:27.798 --> 17:29.741
He never made a statement to that.

17:30.201 --> 17:31.163
I've asked a few people.

17:31.203 --> 17:32.304
Ed Wolff I asked.

17:32.544 --> 17:35.548
I had hoped to ask Lady Eccles.

17:35.568 --> 17:37.270
I still haven't had a chance to talk with her.

17:37.975 --> 17:44.321
Not that they would know, but it would be curious to see if they had any thoughts as people involved in collecting, you know?

17:45.522 --> 17:47.204
I think it's a fascinating issue.

17:47.224 --> 17:48.866
I think that you can... And he's a great example.

17:48.886 --> 17:53.450
I think you can discover reasons which prompt people to start collecting.

17:53.470 --> 18:07.864
You know, if there's some vivid impression that's made on them in someone else's library or maybe in a bookshop, they see that they can afford to purchase and that there is available to them to purchase something if they wouldn't, if they would have expected only to find

18:08.435 --> 18:09.797
In museums.

18:09.817 --> 18:17.289
You know, someone who loves Milton finds in a bookshop a copy of the first edition of Paradise Lost that he or she can afford.

18:17.309 --> 18:19.091
It's accessible and affordable.

18:19.973 --> 18:22.116
Well, it's striking.

18:22.136 --> 18:27.865
You buy that book, and then you buy some more books, and you see that they're available, too.

18:27.885 --> 18:29.127
I mean, he certainly didn't need the money.

18:30.869 --> 18:35.877
I don't think the money was the prime motive for Houghton, for Rappet Houghton.

18:36.211 --> 18:37.412
I don't know.

18:37.432 --> 18:38.894
He built this wonderful structure.

18:38.914 --> 18:41.576
He gave you some wonderful Keats things, I guess.

18:41.637 --> 18:42.738
That's the Keats collection.

18:42.758 --> 18:43.598
It's largely his.

18:43.919 --> 18:46.181
Part of it comes from Amy Lowe.

18:46.501 --> 18:47.182
She started it.

18:47.202 --> 18:53.789
She, if it can be said to have started, Billy Harvard Keats holding.

18:54.069 --> 19:01.937
I can't explain that, and I can't really explain about Harrison and why he stopped neuroscience and didn't continue.

19:02.237 --> 19:04.800
You can always find new things that feel like history of science.

19:04.898 --> 19:11.144
You don't think it was indifference or having secured these things?

19:11.164 --> 19:22.554
If I had any suspicions, I have thought about him a dozen times, and I have never come up with an explanation.

19:22.574 --> 19:33.083
What made me think of it is I have a whole run of book collectors, and there was an article 20 odd years ago, and all it did was outline his major collections, the one here,

19:33.721 --> 19:41.470
the one in New York, the miniature books, the one in Virginia, which is something like the most extraordinary private collection.

19:42.231 --> 19:43.893
And I've seen the catalog of it.

19:43.913 --> 19:52.384
Yeah, well, I mean, I just wonder, maybe it was, I've secured everything, and I mean, what other worlds are there to conquer?

19:53.365 --> 19:53.946
Who's to say?

19:54.827 --> 19:55.828
How did this go off?

19:55.848 --> 19:57.029
Okay, this is a point for you.

19:57.129 --> 19:58.011
Can I come back?

19:58.151 --> 20:00.213
Potentially come back.

20:00.233 --> 20:02.496
We're back on track here.

20:03.387 --> 20:10.617
You mentioned that, oh, does Hart give a book collecting prize, by the way?

20:10.637 --> 20:14.862
Like the Yale Prize, the Brown Pire Prize, University?

20:15.043 --> 20:25.116
Committee to Visit the University Library established several years ago a book collecting prize.

20:28.240 --> 20:33.107
Members of that committee established a second prize in

20:33.560 --> 20:44.617
in honor of Philip Hofer, which includes artwork and books, and I can't remember exactly how it goes.

20:44.697 --> 20:58.538
It may be every other time it switches back and forth, but it gives the undergraduates or the students the chance to compete in collecting art as well as to compete in collecting books.

20:59.024 --> 21:01.046
the William Harris Arnold.

21:01.206 --> 21:05.791
Do you know that name for an American book collector in the early years of the century?

21:06.472 --> 21:09.234
He also did a kind of autobiography.

21:09.254 --> 21:17.122
Here's a William Harris Arnold prize for the best essay on the true spirit of book collector.

21:18.944 --> 21:27.613
And I've had a chance to participate in judging Arnold and visiting committee, not hopefully yet,

21:29.095 --> 21:43.047
And each time, I found a various group of competitors and several good collections and several good essays.

21:43.488 --> 21:45.830
Are these on file in the library, these essays, do you think?

21:46.510 --> 21:51.895
I don't think that, well, you know, I'm so stupid I don't know.

21:52.796 --> 21:53.516
Who would I ask?

21:53.937 --> 21:57.600
The dean is the one who is responsible

21:59.285 --> 22:03.852
eventually, the dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences for these prizes.

22:05.135 --> 22:13.829
And I do not know if we send the prize-winning essay in Arnold to him and whether it's retained or not.

22:13.849 --> 22:14.470
I don't know.

22:15.231 --> 22:16.673
I'd love to read some of them.

22:16.894 --> 22:25.107
It might be interesting to, you know, I'm basically writing a lot of established book collectors, but it would kind of be nice to see

22:25.880 --> 22:27.242
Well, you've got wonderful accounts.

22:28.784 --> 22:35.655
Shopping for books in bookshops or finding books in yard sales and out-of-the-way places.

22:35.955 --> 22:43.506
You know, for rather young people, you've got some pretty nice tales of turning up treasures.

22:43.527 --> 22:46.311
And I think there'd be a freshness and an innocence, too.

22:46.331 --> 22:49.135
It would really be delightful, very useful to me.

22:49.155 --> 22:51.218
And these are the benefactors of tomorrow.

22:51.278 --> 22:54.503
I mean, is this figure into the thinking, do you think?

22:55.158 --> 22:58.462
That's what Tom Adams suggested.

22:59.183 --> 23:04.730
I suppose Arnold was interested in perpetuating the collecting spirit.

23:05.871 --> 23:10.377
So that's one way to do it, to encourage undergraduates or students.

23:11.138 --> 23:14.122
Graduate students can compete for that.

23:14.142 --> 23:23.173
But that perhaps was in his mind in encouraging Harvard students to write about book collecting, to encourage that.

23:24.065 --> 23:25.967
The book collecting spirit.

23:25.987 --> 23:27.148
The true spirit of book collecting.

23:27.168 --> 23:39.339
Which is, in your view, it's not just acquiring scarce and valuable and perhaps valuable titles, but I mean we're preserving achievement and thought, I think.

23:39.380 --> 23:41.021
Is this part of the spirit, do you think?

23:41.401 --> 23:53.633
Well, I suppose it's up to you as the essayist to convince the jury that you're on the beam, that you embody your text, the true spirit, whatever it may be.

23:54.693 --> 24:12.531
whether it's how books fit together that you're getting, or whether it's going out and finding things that you can identify and that you can find out about or that you know about it, or what is your outlook on that enterprise of public collecting?

24:12.551 --> 24:13.291
How do you feel about it?

24:14.372 --> 24:15.634
What's your point of mind?

24:16.755 --> 24:21.079
Let's change track entirely here.

24:21.099 --> 24:23.181
You mentioned that you recently got back from

24:23.701 --> 24:28.126
I guess it's Omaha where they have the Bloomberg stuff.

24:28.146 --> 24:36.337
And I guess you had quite an emotional reaction to that, as you indicated on the phone.

24:36.357 --> 24:40.001
Maybe you could just tell me a little bit about your feelings on that.

24:41.102 --> 24:44.306
And I don't know precisely how I'm going to use this.

24:44.547 --> 24:49.793
I think if we talk about this, we should agree that

24:50.988 --> 25:00.980
what we talk about would not be published in any way until the case is settled.

25:01.000 --> 25:01.340
Okay.

25:01.641 --> 25:16.918
Now, it was due to take place, the trial was due to take place early in November, and it's been postponed, and it is my understanding now that it will take place or begin in the last week of January.

25:18.660 --> 25:19.982
But if by some chance

25:20.789 --> 25:24.092
The trial has not resolved it.

25:25.694 --> 25:34.241
It must be understood that you wouldn't put in a magazine or anything about it, but let's assume now that we're talking... Let me stipulate that.

25:34.462 --> 25:35.803
Can't even make an assumption.

25:35.823 --> 25:42.129
At a moment, we're talking in a moment after it's all over.

25:42.930 --> 25:48.855
I have spent now two stints of work in a warehouse on the outskirts of Omaha,

25:49.730 --> 25:54.234
browsing among some 25,000 books.

25:54.475 --> 25:59.399
That's my estimate, not an official figure.

26:00.340 --> 26:08.388
Most of them showing signs of having been taken from institutional libraries.

26:09.409 --> 26:19.078
And by showing signs, I mean they have book plates and stamps and shelf marks, or they have been defaced

26:19.852 --> 26:29.346
in the places where you expect to find labels on the findings and book plates on the inside cover and markings around the title leaf.

26:31.028 --> 26:49.555
I have now participated in identifying about 750 volumes from the Baker Library in the Harvard Business School and from the Widener Library in the college.

26:51.256 --> 27:17.128
The books taken from Weidner are from the two great Anglin collections, the one formed by John Bartlett, of Bartlett's familiar quotations, who ran the bookshop across the street here, and which was given a shot mark of Ang, A-N-G for Anglin,

27:18.323 --> 27:36.405
which came in in the middle 19th, middle to later 19th century, or from the collection formed by Daniel B. Fearing of Newport, Rhode Island, which came early in the 20th century and which has the prefix, or shall not prefix, of F for fishing.

27:38.668 --> 27:42.112
Is Daniel Fearing spelled with me?

27:43.013 --> 27:43.193
F-E-A-R.

27:43.233 --> 27:47.318
The Fearing books are very easy to identify because they tend to be in half

27:48.023 --> 27:59.374
green Morocco bindings with green marbled paper sides, which is to say they have Morocco corners as well as spine.

28:01.136 --> 28:05.901
The Bartlett copies are half-bound, but not in a regular way.

28:06.281 --> 28:13.449
Fearing obviously had a binder, and he had many of his pamphlets bound in a uniform way.

28:15.731 --> 28:17.693
Now, from those collections, we had

28:18.803 --> 28:34.582
taken the rarities for transfer to the treasure room or to Hogan, so that there were no complete anglers in the 17th century to be removed.

28:34.602 --> 28:46.916
And in large part, the 18th century books had been taken out, so that the books that I found in Moab were largely 19th century books.

28:46.936 --> 28:48.338
A lot of them were very cute.

28:49.027 --> 29:11.810
They were slim, perhaps a small format, maybe a provincially printed account of angling experiences in England, perhaps the catalog of a manufacturer of angling equipment and supplies from the middle or later 19th century.

29:13.772 --> 29:17.616
There was nothing really substantial, but they were pleasant books.

29:17.933 --> 29:21.256
There are books that will give you pleasure.

29:21.657 --> 29:22.077
They're fun.

29:22.577 --> 29:23.699
Were they known to be missing?

29:25.340 --> 29:41.556
Now, since we don't make regular inventories in Leidener or in Baker, that's a question that really doesn't pertain.

29:41.656 --> 29:42.557
Okay.

29:42.737 --> 29:45.139
Because if you want to say,

29:45.777 --> 29:48.981
Which of the three million volumes in the central collections are missing now?

29:49.922 --> 29:56.690
The only ones you know about are the ones that people have asked about and have pursued so as to get a shelf check.

29:56.710 --> 30:01.255
Well, first, it's a book I've been looking for in Widener for the last nine months, and it's continually out.

30:01.676 --> 30:04.419
I have to assume that... Charged out?

30:05.320 --> 30:07.463
I haven't checked to see if it's charged out.

30:07.483 --> 30:08.604
It's been out for nine months.

30:08.644 --> 30:10.206
Could somebody have a book for nine months?

30:11.728 --> 30:12.088
Yes.

30:12.473 --> 30:14.315
Okay, and it hasn't been that critical.

30:14.375 --> 30:16.216
It's just a book on Garrick, you know.

30:16.237 --> 30:20.921
You should go to the... ...and see if it's charged out, and they'll get it back, you see.

30:21.181 --> 30:23.884
But that actually would almost force them to look at it.

30:24.184 --> 30:26.506
That would force them to look and see if it is charged out.

30:26.526 --> 30:29.989
Yes, and they would go through a routine if there's no charge.

30:30.350 --> 30:41.400
They'd go through a routine, and then they'd declare it lost, and then that book would go to a book selector who would decide whether they ought to try to buy a reprint or a new edition of that book to replace it, you see.

30:41.971 --> 30:44.094
But it's only books like that that you find out about.

30:44.154 --> 30:52.323
The other books you would only find out about if you made an inventory, which means taking the shelf list cards or printouts and going over the shelves.

30:52.684 --> 30:55.407
And that's when you find misplaced books, mis-shelved books.

30:55.427 --> 30:57.950
That's probably the only way you're going to find a mis-shelved book.

30:59.091 --> 31:00.313
And your book could be mis-shelved.

31:00.673 --> 31:02.535
It could be a thousand numbers away.

31:03.216 --> 31:06.120
It's a very difficult thing, isn't it?

31:06.140 --> 31:06.440
Yes.

31:06.520 --> 31:10.645
This guy has things that nobody knows, and it's almost impossible to know.

31:11.401 --> 31:12.122
that they're missing.

31:12.282 --> 31:12.522
Yes.

31:13.343 --> 31:14.444
I guess is what I'm driving at.

31:14.464 --> 31:21.892
I'm not trying to suggest that you should have known they were gone, it's just that it's almost impossible to know that they're going to be dealing with 11 million books at our university.

31:22.232 --> 31:24.835
And there are dozens of other libraries that are in the same situation.

31:26.797 --> 31:40.210
The other category of books from Weidner, in addition to the Angling books, is books of American local history, particularly Southern, Southwestern,

31:41.320 --> 31:44.725
far western towns and states.

31:44.745 --> 31:55.881
He, for instance, had an envelope full of early 1880s Wyoming imprints in the Wyoming section in the U.S.

31:55.901 --> 31:59.346
history classification library.

31:59.366 --> 32:03.272
From Baker, he took similar material.

32:04.754 --> 32:09.741
The promotional books and pamphlets that towns and cities made

32:10.312 --> 32:15.299
trying to demonstrate that they were a good place to come to go into business, you see.

32:16.420 --> 32:18.944
And this literature goes back to the middle of the 19th century.

32:19.004 --> 32:24.131
So he had some very nice earlier books from Baker of that sort.

32:24.452 --> 32:26.575
The Widener ones tended to be turn of the century.

32:26.595 --> 32:29.899
And then there were a few things from the Quest collection.

32:30.280 --> 32:35.547
Some of them were just works in economic theory and economic history that he'd taken.

32:35.567 --> 32:37.269
Do you have a handle on this guy?

32:37.309 --> 32:39.913
There were some other books from Widener that had to do with

32:40.147 --> 32:49.922
Now, if you looked at the collection as a whole, Angling was an odd, odd interest.

32:49.942 --> 32:54.449
You didn't find Angling books when taken from other places.

32:54.469 --> 32:56.852
Yes.

32:57.653 --> 33:07.268
He must have discovered the Angling collection and then decided that that would be something that would be fun to work with.

33:08.699 --> 33:13.266
But you can't say that he picked this up and took dangling books from the other libraries.

33:14.749 --> 33:29.432
But he did take from a variety of libraries books which had to do with ornamental hardware, which in the news accounts you will find is said to be a specialty.

33:29.492 --> 33:32.918
He knew a lot about hardware to begin with.

33:33.118 --> 33:36.343
He also stole antiques and things, right?

33:36.830 --> 33:54.916
But you did find ornamental hardware, the catalogs of manufacturers, and then a lot of 19th century books on house plans and building, and some 20th century books, too.

33:55.517 --> 33:56.358
Not early books.

33:58.020 --> 33:59.563
For the most part, his books were in English.

34:01.445 --> 34:04.069
He didn't really go into foreign languages.

34:04.336 --> 34:10.763
so that he could read all the books that he was getting.

34:10.784 --> 34:21.096
So that formed a special collection of the ornamental hardware to the building, building design and building ornaments.

34:21.116 --> 34:31.828
And then the local history, there were books from many libraries having to do with interesting southern and southwestern and western towns and states.

34:33.412 --> 34:41.041
The special interest was Indians, and there were wonderful books on Indians that I had never heard of or seen before.

34:42.403 --> 34:46.448
Textbooks for the Indian schools, accounts of Indians.

34:47.710 --> 34:52.916
He really did very well in the collecting of Indians.

34:53.257 --> 35:00.145
I confess that I did not see all the books, but he must have cleaned Wayne State out of

35:00.395 --> 35:05.242
early books, FTC books, 16th century books.

35:05.262 --> 35:13.233
And he did very well in, was it Pomona and University of Southern California in Southwest Americana.

35:14.255 --> 35:22.507
I think that the books that impressed me most were the books from Southwest, early Southwestern immigrants that he got there.

35:24.630 --> 35:28.275
So that the impression that you got from this was not of a

35:29.150 --> 35:36.117
some kind of a maniac who was taking any book that he could find.

35:36.717 --> 35:39.200
That was not the case at all.

35:39.320 --> 35:39.900
It was focus.

35:40.781 --> 35:57.958
This is the result of a collector with definable interests who is working on a set of collections any way he can, and instead of buying books from booksellers,

35:58.242 --> 36:02.629
he is taking books wherever he can get in.

36:04.031 --> 36:10.300
So there's a very clever mentality at work here, not an insane one at all.

36:13.044 --> 36:23.240
There is at work there a person who I am told... Hello?

36:24.001 --> 36:24.081
Yep.

36:26.828 --> 36:54.760
I am told the work of someone who stole band instruments and antiques and anything that he could to sell at flea markets and swap fairs and the like to obtain income so that the activities of Mr. Lundberg were not at all confined to books

36:55.567 --> 36:56.948
I think he kept the books, though.

36:56.968 --> 37:00.652
And this was probably about the sentence to nourish the book away.

37:00.732 --> 37:07.078
As you say, he kept the books, but you don't know what, you can't tell what his intentions were.

37:08.419 --> 37:20.951
Someone who removes Marx from such a vast point of view of books is taking the first step toward sales.

37:21.232 --> 37:24.915
If I steal a book and keep it at home,

37:25.250 --> 37:32.518
I can leave the Yale marks in it, you know, in my private reserve.

37:33.339 --> 37:43.071
But if it occurs to me that I might like to sell that book from Yale, I would start working away, and I'd remove all the marks from it.

37:43.091 --> 37:52.101
And hundreds and hundreds, if not thousands, of books were worked on, some of them very crudely, very crudely indeed.

37:52.368 --> 37:58.616
You find a notary squeeze stamp over the library squeeze stamp obliterating it so you couldn't possibly make it out.

37:58.636 --> 38:04.384
And then there are places where a piece is cut out of the leaf, you see.

38:04.864 --> 38:06.366
So he has damaged a number of books.

38:06.827 --> 38:09.350
A lot of these books are mutilated.

38:10.732 --> 38:18.342
But the work extends, ranges from this brutalizing

38:18.507 --> 38:35.983
of books, to obliterate marks and remove marks, to very sophisticated work, so that only when you perhaps rub your finger against the pastel end paper do you see a fine mark of paste.

38:36.023 --> 38:41.888
You pick it up at your fingertip when you can't really see it straight away.

38:42.148 --> 38:47.333
Or you hold a leaf up to the light and you see the dampness on a corner.

38:47.752 --> 38:58.607
Many tidal leaves were cut out so that they could be worked on with an iron and soap and are loosely inserted.

38:59.148 --> 39:03.514
So there's quite a range of work on removing marks.

39:05.196 --> 39:17.573
And the most perverse of the tamperings amounted to replacing marks.

39:17.924 --> 39:46.142
Now, at the end of my last stint, I was there two and a half days that time, I was commencing to identify Harvard books simply from the distinctive font used to stamp the gold lettering on Steins and the distinctive handwriting

39:46.375 --> 40:15.910
used to mark letters on pamphlet bindings, the kind of repair work, cloth repair work done in Widener, the texture and color of the binding cloth, and the board used in pamphlet bindings in Baker and in Widener, because the books I was identifying had labels on them

40:16.210 --> 40:20.295
with shelf marks that were not in the Harvard system.

40:20.876 --> 40:25.342
I don't, to confess, know which library they're from.

40:25.382 --> 40:39.501
Books which would have inside perhaps an ink stamp of the University of Minnesota Education Library, Minneapolis Public Library, a book plate, or something like that, and no Harvard marks on the title leaf, except perhaps

40:40.088 --> 40:49.060
a forgotten mark that might seem irrelevant to some people, but which would mean something to those of us who work a lot in this stack of library.

40:49.080 --> 40:57.431
And this was the most aggravating part of my work among these books, not to say, oh, that's a fearing copy.

40:57.451 --> 41:05.022
You know, from 20 feet away, you can look at that green morocco and that distinctive marble paper and say, ah, that's a fearing copy.

41:06.584 --> 41:09.808
But working with these books that had bogus marks added

41:10.649 --> 41:17.518
And I cannot explain that except to say that it might help you to take a book out of a library.

41:17.819 --> 41:31.678
If you were working at the Sterling Library and you had taken in some book plates from Widener, and if you removed Sterling plates and put Widener's plates in their place, you'd show them to the guard and say, this is a video copy.

41:31.698 --> 41:35.483
I'm a Harvard student and I've brought this with me.

41:35.503 --> 41:36.705
That sort of thing.

41:38.648 --> 41:38.968
Thank you, Paul.

41:40.822 --> 41:43.386
There's one route to get the books out of the library.

41:43.406 --> 41:43.926
It could be.

41:44.287 --> 41:45.048
I can't explain it.

41:45.108 --> 41:45.569
I don't know.

41:45.629 --> 41:48.593
There may be some testimony about how this works.

41:48.653 --> 41:49.334
Are you going to go to the trial?

41:49.775 --> 41:50.877
I will be a witness.

41:51.838 --> 41:58.868
I'll be responsible for a long list of argued books that we have identified.

41:59.930 --> 42:01.792
We've gone through quite a drill.

42:03.295 --> 42:05.698
We were given a lot of shelf marks

42:06.421 --> 42:13.929
from notes and book plates that had been removed and found in a trunk full of that sort of thing.

42:13.949 --> 42:24.820
And we took those and checked them against the shelf list and got back to the books and then checked to see if the book was on the shelf and produced a bibliographic entry to go back to the FBI.

42:25.280 --> 42:30.606
And in that way, we found some books that we wouldn't have found otherwise.

42:30.626 --> 42:34.690
And we had checked the shelf, checked the card catalog,

42:35.294 --> 42:39.938
For some of these books, Harvard's got three or four copies in various places.

42:39.958 --> 42:43.762
And in some cases, we would go to the shelf and we'd find three copies and not the fourth copy.

42:44.582 --> 42:49.847
And then we would note the shelf mark of the fourth copy and see if that fitted the copy in question.

42:49.967 --> 43:05.301
So there are altogether hundreds and hundreds of hours of work that went in on this case, not only here in Hoden, working on the Widener part, but on the part of our colleagues in Widener, and then our colleagues in the Business School in the Baker Library.

43:06.614 --> 43:07.735
But that's only the first step.

43:08.376 --> 43:15.724
When these books come back, we're going to have to remove these bogus markings and re-tag them in order to put them back on the shelf.

43:15.744 --> 43:19.208
So there's an immense cost involved there inside the library.

43:20.069 --> 43:34.384
And the worst thing of all, and I've made a talk about this at the Columbia Library School in July, the worst of this is that all these libraries are a network of sharing institutions.

43:34.404 --> 43:35.946
Now, the first

43:36.736 --> 43:47.653
organized sharing was this National Union catalog, a Carnegie-funded catalog in the Library of Congress, which was the first card catalog, and then got printed as that big set of books.

43:48.675 --> 43:56.788
And this is the way that your interlibrary loan would discover a copy of a book that your library didn't have for you as a student or scholar.

43:57.409 --> 44:03.418
You'd send a letter to Washington, and they would tell you that Yale has that book.

44:03.770 --> 44:05.653
And then you try to get it from Yale.

44:05.693 --> 44:08.076
It's also a road map for a guy like Blumgård.

44:08.176 --> 44:08.516
Oh, yes.

44:08.817 --> 44:09.518
Oh, yes, it can be.

44:09.978 --> 44:10.920
But that was the first step.

44:10.980 --> 44:15.586
And now we're all in these, you know, networks, computer networks.

44:16.107 --> 44:24.698
So what you did by consulting the cards, the Library of Congress, and then the book catalogs, and you see UW doing a computer.

44:25.379 --> 44:26.601
And these locations come up.

44:27.502 --> 44:30.486
So you go for the library that's closest to you,

44:30.938 --> 44:37.007
a library that perhaps you exchange a lot with, and you borrow the book, or you got a microfilm of that book for the scholar who needs it.

44:37.468 --> 44:38.830
This is how things work in this country.

44:39.511 --> 44:44.999
Well, if somebody comes along and steals 25,000 of these books, they're not there.

44:46.081 --> 44:51.069
And whenever the book comes out, someone has got to start going through that drill.

44:52.290 --> 44:56.938
You know, the interlibrary loan request goes out to the University of Southern California.

44:56.958 --> 44:57.919
Somebody goes to the shelf.

44:58.059 --> 44:58.820
Well, the book isn't there.

44:59.021 --> 44:59.882
Is it in the shelf?

45:00.655 --> 45:05.820
You immediately start this expensive process of discovering where the book is.

45:06.401 --> 45:11.566
In the end, it may take you a couple of weeks, and you discover you can't find the book.

45:11.646 --> 45:12.186
It's lost.

45:12.346 --> 45:16.631
So you report back to Yale, no, I'm sorry, we can't find our copy.

45:17.171 --> 45:21.996
So here you are back at square one at the interlibrary loan office in Yale, and the scholar are waiting for the book.

45:22.476 --> 45:24.378
It's three weeks or four weeks gone now.

45:25.039 --> 45:27.321
Now they're going to go to the second library and try it there.

45:27.976 --> 45:40.532
Well, there's 25,000 books plucked out of this network of sharing institutions, which is just putting roadblocks in everybody's way when they're collecting their books to do their teaching or their learning or their scholarship or research.

45:41.634 --> 45:53.609
On the other side of it, there are whole collections that are so decimated that they cannot be very useful locally, because in some cases there's so many books taken from one institution.

45:53.629 --> 45:56.553
What's your feeling in this room, in this warehouse?

45:56.573 --> 45:57.915
What's the sense of

45:59.093 --> 46:14.612
I mean, as a person who's committed his professional life, and I'm sure it's more than a way of making a living for you, I mean, it's a passion to walk into a warehouse that contains 25,000 stolen items.

46:15.172 --> 46:15.773
What do you feel?

46:15.933 --> 46:20.679
I mean, there has to be some kind of emotional, intellectual reaction for you.

46:20.699 --> 46:22.161
In the end, it's the impact of this.

46:24.043 --> 46:28.408
You know, if somebody steals a book from you, you are impaired.

46:28.861 --> 46:29.702
Just you.

46:30.885 --> 46:31.325
Are you okay?

46:32.287 --> 46:33.048
I just don't want to miss it.

46:33.068 --> 46:33.770
It's just you.

46:33.930 --> 46:37.175
You know, you have a book that you are very fond of and somebody steals it from you.

46:38.558 --> 46:40.341
You're the only one who's impaired.

46:41.222 --> 46:43.526
You're going to widen your stack and steal a book.

46:43.546 --> 46:46.932
And it's a whole community of scholars, depending on which book you take.

46:47.233 --> 46:51.019
You take a book of which there are 50 editions and 100 copies.

46:51.340 --> 46:52.802
That's no different.

46:52.823 --> 46:53.704
You're not going to impair much.

46:53.937 --> 47:01.127
Well, if I go in to find Sylvester de Sassi's book, and I know you've only got one copy, and I don't know where the hell I'm going to find a copy of this stuff myself.

47:01.468 --> 47:03.390
Now, I'm really in a fix, aren't I?

47:03.410 --> 47:04.712
Yes.

47:04.732 --> 47:13.665
And these books tend to be Sylvester de Sassi kind of books that we're talking about here.

47:14.046 --> 47:15.227
There are some reference books.

47:15.247 --> 47:18.131
There is a bibliographical reference.

47:18.191 --> 47:20.014
How long did you put that?

47:20.034 --> 47:20.575
Here and there.

47:21.035 --> 47:23.539
A pretty good bibliographical reference.

47:24.464 --> 47:28.470
Well, it seems as big as this.

47:28.490 --> 47:29.532
Which is more than that, I think.

47:29.672 --> 47:31.995
And those are books that you can find.

47:32.015 --> 47:34.159
There's nothing special about those.

47:34.179 --> 47:38.405
You've got a lot of booksellers' catalogs, particularly Antoine.

47:38.645 --> 47:47.879
I don't know where they came from.

47:47.899 --> 47:49.622
But you kept beyond the reference collection.

47:50.143 --> 47:52.446
And these are books that really

47:53.438 --> 48:03.111
are going to be hard to replace, and perhaps hard to find the second or third of a tangible copy when this first copy is found missing.

48:03.331 --> 48:05.314
Have you ever seen anything of a scale before?

48:05.394 --> 48:08.478
I've never heard of anything like this.

48:08.538 --> 48:16.068
No, we've had a set of interesting thieves here.

48:17.650 --> 48:23.378
The so-called French Thief, who I think had about a thousand titles out of Widener.

48:24.134 --> 48:28.679
And we just discovered him and his cache in the summer.

48:29.240 --> 48:30.741
The summer just passed?

48:31.002 --> 48:31.342
Right.

48:32.583 --> 48:39.931
And then we had a bright, he was very bright, the French Thief.

48:39.951 --> 48:41.954
French titles, in other words.

48:42.094 --> 48:42.554
French books.

48:43.776 --> 48:54.107
And he was dubbed the French Thief because he was preceded by an English thief who had thousands of books.

48:54.712 --> 49:06.886
out of British constitutional history, and was discovered by his janitor packing these books up and about to take them to his first teaching job out in California.

49:06.946 --> 49:08.608
This was an academic?

49:08.988 --> 49:24.145
Yes, he was graduating in history, in a graduate school in history, and had his first teaching job out in the West, and it had all these widely books and cartons, and he was going to ship them out.

49:24.580 --> 49:30.005
But he had really blocked study or teaching in his subject.

49:30.046 --> 49:35.451
He had stolen so many books on the same theme, you see, the English one.

49:35.471 --> 49:51.367
And then in between the English one and the French one, we had a thief who was another long-term, long-time member of the graduate to our school here.

49:51.387 --> 49:54.250
He stole about 250 books, but they were all war books.

49:54.567 --> 50:04.239
They were the kind that we tried to identify and transfer to the River Books Library, and he had started to offer them for sale in Boston and New York, and the booksellers found it.

50:04.860 --> 50:06.362
The booksellers are very good about this.

50:07.323 --> 50:12.850
They know very well if you bring in some books and they don't suit your conversation.

50:12.890 --> 50:17.696
Were any criminal proceedings running against these people?

50:17.736 --> 50:20.980
Were any criminal proceedings running against these people?

50:21.247 --> 50:30.276
Now, I don't know what's going to happen to the French thief.

50:31.758 --> 50:43.270
I think they're trying to pursue him, but he is way out of state when we, according to most recent advice, it's Colorado or something like that.

50:43.290 --> 50:44.291
But have the books with him?

50:44.611 --> 50:48.655
No, the books were here, in Cambridge, in the Port of the Square.

50:49.765 --> 50:50.706
So I don't know.

50:50.886 --> 50:53.549
I think that they will try to see if they can find him.

50:54.390 --> 50:58.795
He's long gone from Cambridge, and last heard from.

50:59.696 --> 51:09.767
Now, the one in the middle, who stole the rare books, was prosecuted.

51:11.790 --> 51:18.237
This is something I can check in the... I can find...

51:18.689 --> 51:33.263
down as a follow-up for me, I can get his name, and I can get a letter from the director of the University Library that says what happened, and I can't remember the technical term, the court term.

51:33.323 --> 51:35.946
And all I can tell is if you give me his name, I'll get it, too, from the court.

51:36.086 --> 51:36.847
I'm very glad.

51:36.867 --> 51:45.135
Well, anyhow, the way I'll find it is to get this letter out from the director of the library that says he's to be denied access to the library.

51:45.554 --> 51:51.159
It tells what happened, and you can take the name, and he refers to the court, too.

51:51.219 --> 51:53.781
Well, I'll just get that from public records.

51:53.802 --> 52:00.608
And the first one is Jeffrey Nelson, who stole all the English books, and that didn't get to court.

52:00.628 --> 52:07.234
He was denied his doctorate by the faculty, and I don't know what's happened to him.

52:07.974 --> 52:09.956
He made the newspapers.

52:10.256 --> 52:11.277
Oh, he did make the newspapers.

52:11.317 --> 52:14.160
And if you will remind me of him,

52:14.680 --> 52:23.451
And this rare book thief, I can get, I'll give you a year for Nelson.

52:24.892 --> 52:26.675
Jeffrey with a J, I would imagine.

52:26.815 --> 52:29.959
All I've got is, I have a folder.

52:29.999 --> 52:31.901
I'm pretty sure it's at home.

52:32.381 --> 52:37.367
This is very important, you know, this has to be treated tastefully.

52:37.568 --> 52:41.953
Let me just touch it here.

52:46.253 --> 52:50.457
I left that this morning.

52:52.298 --> 52:58.224
But I have in one of those blue folders, Nelson and the year and month.

52:58.244 --> 53:00.706
It's about commencement time that he's discovered.

53:00.726 --> 53:02.067
It's at the end of the academic year.

53:02.688 --> 53:04.269
He's packing up, you see, to leave Harvard.

53:05.050 --> 53:08.633
And give you the year for Nelson, it'll be something like June.

53:08.653 --> 53:10.135
And I'll get the name.

53:10.215 --> 53:11.175
And you say he made the papers?

53:12.677 --> 53:15.079
Yes, because he'd stolen from several places.

53:16.477 --> 53:25.769
Well, so had the French that he'd stolen from Currie down in Milton, Currie College.

53:25.889 --> 53:42.950
And as I say of him, he was much more threatening there than here, because if you take a thousand books away from Widener, he was not only taking a thousand books away from Currie College, and he had pretty near the whole play act.

53:43.011 --> 53:44.172
You know what the French

53:44.337 --> 53:46.099
standard tradition.

53:46.119 --> 53:48.001
The library of America has modeled after that.

53:48.021 --> 53:50.624
Yeah, pretty near the whole Playad out of Curry College.

53:50.824 --> 53:54.828
And if you can imagine yourself trying to teach a little French literature down there, there's your Playad.

53:56.229 --> 53:57.731
In Widener, you've got backups.

53:57.811 --> 54:02.916
You know, the Playad is not the only edition of Moliere that you've got to work with.

54:03.097 --> 54:11.205
That was a case where you really can affect the local teaching program like that at Curry College.

54:12.130 --> 54:17.735
Keep at me for those two, and I will give you a date and a name.

54:17.815 --> 54:19.177
And you're going to the trial, right?

54:20.058 --> 54:33.571
I am among half a dozen librarians who are scheduled to testify for the prosecution about our losses.

54:35.693 --> 54:41.158
I assume that they'll have a list, and they'll say,

54:41.611 --> 54:47.720
Does this represent the books stolen from, or something like that?

54:47.780 --> 54:49.682
Did they indicate how long the trial might take?

54:49.743 --> 54:50.924
No.

54:50.944 --> 54:52.947
I think I'll be intended.

54:52.967 --> 54:55.010
I think it will be worthwhile.

54:55.030 --> 54:55.591
Oh, yeah.

54:55.611 --> 54:56.232
No question.

54:57.273 --> 55:09.070
If it is permitted to go the distance, if they're permitted to make their case,

55:09.792 --> 55:16.218
If the prosecution is permitted to make its case, that would be absolutely fascinating.

55:16.238 --> 55:24.065
And it's possible that we will learn some of the details about how these thefts were effective.

55:24.305 --> 55:24.766
I would hope.

55:24.826 --> 55:26.287
I mean, they've got him dead to rights.

55:26.327 --> 55:33.714
I would hope they would not accept a plea, because I think they owe it to the scholarly community to find out as much about this as we possibly can.

55:35.115 --> 55:35.775
I think you're right.

55:35.916 --> 55:38.618
I'm very much impressed by the federal

55:39.509 --> 55:41.451
officers and the FBI.

55:41.831 --> 55:50.239
And of course I've seen more of the FBI than I have of the prosecutors.

55:50.259 --> 55:58.367
But I could imagine people in that line of business losing their patience over this.

55:59.228 --> 56:05.754
You know, it's not like that drug bust of stolen automobiles or something like that.

56:05.774 --> 56:07.896
This is pretty finicky small stuff.

56:08.770 --> 56:11.294
But they discovered what they had.

56:12.315 --> 56:15.340
They went to the library community and said, what do we do?

56:16.822 --> 56:18.965
And they got good advice, and they took it.

56:19.626 --> 56:22.090
And they received absolute support.

56:22.110 --> 56:26.737
You know, if they told me, we need you out there tomorrow to look at these books, I would go.

56:27.719 --> 56:29.281
Because it has to be done.

56:29.341 --> 56:30.363
Just full of respect.

56:30.523 --> 56:32.366
Maybe it's a blessing that it's in the Midwest.

56:32.426 --> 56:34.609
If this were in one of these really harried...

56:35.450 --> 56:37.433
East Coast, Boston, New York.

56:37.714 --> 56:40.659
I can't speak to that.

56:40.679 --> 56:44.886
I can speak to their dedication and their patience over this.

56:46.108 --> 56:48.973
The officers involved are really trying to do the right thing.

56:49.013 --> 56:54.302
They commanded our respect from the outset and right through everything.

56:54.322 --> 56:56.185
I've never been let down by them.

56:56.706 --> 56:58.910
I think I'll make a call out there again next week.

56:58.930 --> 57:00.613
They wouldn't let me into the warehouse.

57:00.745 --> 57:01.986
And I can respect that.

57:02.006 --> 57:02.547
Well, they shouldn't.

57:03.107 --> 57:04.769
I respect it entirely.

57:05.069 --> 57:13.017
That's why we're talking about some time after the trial has run its course.

57:13.117 --> 57:14.398
Absolutely without question.

57:14.499 --> 57:17.281
And let me put the machine on it.

57:17.301 --> 57:21.505
There's no way I would use any of this stuff prior to the resolution of the case.

57:21.946 --> 57:22.927
And I run it by you, too.

57:24.308 --> 57:27.772
I've made this commitment a number of times.

57:27.792 --> 57:29.233
But I want the thing right.

57:29.753 --> 57:40.168
correct, and I don't want any high feelings on anybody's part, but I also want, I think this really deserves to be told, this is really an extraordinary case.

57:41.090 --> 57:41.490
It really is.

57:42.392 --> 57:46.437
You know, I haven't seen anything here at Holden yet, and I don't think I have to do it today.

57:46.457 --> 57:52.767
I mean, I've never really been in to see any of the Holden that you have here.

57:54.529 --> 57:56.993
Is that something you'd like to do, something really good for today?

57:57.774 --> 57:59.136
I don't want to

57:59.403 --> 58:01.846
I've taken two hours of your time already.

58:01.866 --> 58:05.751
I don't quite because I knocked a half hour right out of here.

58:05.771 --> 58:14.183
Fortunately for me, you're not far away, and if you have other things that you want to do, I can always... Well, we might as well pursue today what's on your mind today.

58:14.984 --> 58:15.965
Okay.

58:15.985 --> 58:17.948
There's always another time to look.

58:17.968 --> 58:22.053
What is it that you would like to see about this place?

58:22.253 --> 58:26.339
I would like to see... I would like to have a feel for some of the treasures that you have.

58:26.579 --> 58:28.802
And at some point...

58:29.086 --> 58:29.647
Okay.

58:29.667 --> 58:37.578
I would like to have the experience of requesting something and go through the process of bidding.

58:37.759 --> 58:38.940
Well, you could do that anytime.

58:39.081 --> 58:52.400
If you bring in two IDs, register as a reader up at that desk in the lobby, and you get a reader's card, and you put that in the reading room, you leave that there, and it's good until July 1st when you're supposed to register again.

58:52.500 --> 58:53.181
I'll do that today.

58:53.201 --> 58:57.287
You'd like a picture ID, a driver's license, a passport, something else.

58:58.162 --> 58:59.364
And then you're on your own.

58:59.404 --> 59:02.549
You've got a lot of readers' cards now with six different institutions.

59:02.589 --> 59:07.216
There's a lot of shelf marks in the bridge catalog there that's immediately accessible to you.

59:08.237 --> 59:11.302
Well, Mark, why don't I do that?

59:11.462 --> 59:14.747
As opposed to bothering you with a tour.

59:15.649 --> 59:16.690
Well, that's not a tour.

59:18.313 --> 59:24.442
It's a tour of discovery for myself, I think.

59:24.983 --> 59:26.245
What's the main theme of the book?

59:26.528 --> 59:29.552
Is it the market or is it the collector?

59:29.772 --> 59:30.853
It's collecting.

59:30.873 --> 59:31.835
Say again.

59:32.495 --> 59:43.329
We're going to do an exhibition on collectors for our 50th birthday in 1992.

59:43.349 --> 59:53.802
In this building are a couple of spots dedicated to collectors.

59:54.187 --> 01:00:00.177
If you wanted to skip along now, can we do that?

01:00:00.337 --> 01:00:10.794
There's a talk at 4.30 in one of the rooms, but I would make a point of showing you two rooms that have to do with collectors.

01:00:10.994 --> 01:00:11.855
That's very good.

01:00:12.136 --> 01:00:16.583
And one collector is not new and one isn't.
