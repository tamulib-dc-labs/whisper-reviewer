WEBVTT

00:02.714 --> 00:07.598
A few couple of days, so you'll have to forgive me if I sound a little naive in some of my questions.

00:07.739 --> 00:08.860
Okay.

00:08.880 --> 00:10.821
Are you, by the way, can I ask you a question?

00:10.841 --> 00:11.282
Please go ahead.

00:11.302 --> 00:12.203
Are you an education reporter?

00:12.263 --> 00:15.285
Have you done this beat at all before?

00:15.305 --> 00:15.846
Education?

00:15.906 --> 00:16.426
No.

00:16.486 --> 00:18.889
I've been writing about books for about 20 years.

00:19.009 --> 00:20.430
You're a book guy.

00:20.450 --> 00:21.051
I see.

00:21.411 --> 00:26.916
And I just have written my own book, as a matter of fact, which did pretty well.

00:26.976 --> 00:27.877
On what subject?

00:27.897 --> 00:30.299
It was on books, on the passion for books.

00:30.659 --> 00:32.721
It was called A Gentle Madness.

00:32.701 --> 00:36.985
It was shortlisted for the National Book Critics Circle Award this year, I'm pleased to see.

00:37.005 --> 00:37.226
Oh, good.

00:38.147 --> 00:42.451
And just got into its fifth printing, and it's about 50,000 copies in print.

00:43.632 --> 00:44.013
Fantastic.

00:44.173 --> 00:46.195
Well, I hope we'll notice that one.

00:46.215 --> 00:56.886
And let me also say I'm working on a new book, which is why when Marley suggested that we talk, I am writing a new book about book culture, books...

00:57.271 --> 01:16.326
There will be a chapter on literacy and books of the future, where we're going. I'm talking I'm really I am really quite interested in learning more about the things you write about so so there is a subtext here. I'm not only interested in writing a piece for

01:16.694 --> 01:23.428
for this weekly column that I write, which is syndicated, by the way, in about 25 newspapers, largely in university cities.

01:25.031 --> 01:27.876
I'm in, you know, Eugene, Oregon and Charlottesville.

01:27.897 --> 01:29.520
I'm in Charlottesville, as a matter of fact.

01:29.540 --> 01:29.820
Oh, really?

01:30.201 --> 01:30.301
Good.

01:30.542 --> 01:32.305
I'm in every week in the Daily Progress.

01:32.907 --> 01:33.367
What day?

01:34.129 --> 01:34.951
Sunday, I guess.

01:35.592 --> 01:38.257
I do the weekly book column in the Daily Progress.

01:38.358 --> 01:38.618
Oh, good.

01:39.239 --> 01:45.213
So I'm in Knoxville, Gainesville, a couple of papers here in New England, two in Massachusetts.

01:45.233 --> 01:46.155
People who read books.

01:46.556 --> 01:47.438
That's the whole idea.

01:47.458 --> 01:49.924
I've syndicated it myself and I've gone after

01:50.225 --> 01:57.314
cities where I know people read books, buy books, and where the newspapers also don't have a regular book guy, you know?

01:58.335 --> 02:00.478
That makes sense.

02:00.498 --> 02:01.319
So that's what I do.

02:01.880 --> 02:05.945
And I just got your book, you'll have to forgive me, yesterday.

02:06.005 --> 02:11.112
It's kind of a fast, but I mean, I certainly know the themes here.

02:11.953 --> 02:19.202
Tell me a little bit about, is this a clarion call, let's say, that you're issuing with this book?

02:19.672 --> 02:22.115
Let's enter the conversation.

02:23.676 --> 02:24.678
Why don't I let you start?

02:24.818 --> 02:33.528
I'd rather have it a clarion call to do something than just be thought of like a complaint.

02:34.108 --> 02:43.098
That's why I gave it a positive title rather than... That's what the negative one in the... Well, it could be the schools we don't have.

02:43.138 --> 02:47.263
Is that right?

02:47.283 --> 02:47.383
Yeah.

02:48.578 --> 02:51.903
I mean, it could have been that, couldn't it?

02:51.923 --> 02:56.010
The schools we don't have, that's right.

02:56.030 --> 02:59.635
But as you say, you want to be very optimistic about it.

02:59.655 --> 03:10.452
Yes, and suggest that both how we got schools that don't work and

03:10.718 --> 03:13.402
what we need to do to have schools that work.

03:13.863 --> 03:14.504
Well, what happened?

03:14.544 --> 03:16.487
We certainly had schools that worked, didn't we?

03:16.908 --> 03:30.328
Well, there's a dispute about that by the defenders of the academic establishment, which the party line there is that there never was a golden age of American education.

03:32.211 --> 03:38.481
And when people give examples of how in earlier times they and their

03:38.866 --> 04:03.540
colleagues were better educated the answer is well in those days you were educating just a smaller percentage of the American citizens and now we're educating all groups and it's a much more diverse country and so on I don't believe that line myself but in any case I

04:04.381 --> 04:09.550
If you say we used to be a lot better, which I believe can be documented.

04:09.830 --> 04:13.938
By the way, it's documented in, let me give just one example.

04:13.958 --> 04:22.272
In 1980, there was a new science

04:23.821 --> 04:28.586
the International Study of Science Achievement by elementary school children.

04:29.768 --> 04:31.770
And in 1970, the U.S.

04:31.910 --> 04:36.676
ranked seventh among 17 countries.

04:37.877 --> 04:46.707
And in 1980, it ranked 16th among 17 countries, so something like that.

04:47.041 --> 04:54.256
There is evidence that by the same kind of measure, done the same way, that the U.S.

04:54.296 --> 04:57.262
has fallen, certainly in relative terms.

04:57.282 --> 05:00.469
Of course, it could be argued that the others have gotten better, too, I suppose.

05:00.489 --> 05:01.130
Yes, that's right.

05:01.351 --> 05:03.455
That's why I say in relative terms.

05:03.515 --> 05:04.898
That's the only thing we know.

05:04.878 --> 05:15.620
Though one could, of course, if one calibrated the test, which it probably could be done, which I haven't done, you could find out how we did in relation to our own fire performance.

05:15.720 --> 05:15.981
To ourselves.

05:16.001 --> 05:21.371
And then we do look out and we see how college board tests in particular have been dumbed down.

05:21.712 --> 05:26.582
The famous SAT drop in the 60s, and that's a fact that

05:26.984 --> 05:31.450
has been avoided and apologized for ever since the 1970s.

05:31.910 --> 05:37.357
And the fact that, you know, people were getting 300s and said, well, let's just make the test score different.

05:37.477 --> 05:39.540
So make people feel good about themselves.

05:39.640 --> 05:45.848
And you certainly have very strong opinions on that, don't you?

05:46.248 --> 05:50.133
This whole concept of making students feel good about themselves.

05:50.153 --> 05:54.038
Well, I wouldn't say I had

05:54.878 --> 06:02.847
I didn't start out with a sort of ideological bias or strong opinions about the nature of life.

06:03.148 --> 06:11.357
I have a much more scholarly or research orientation to the subject, and the evidence is that the self-esteem movement doesn't work.

06:12.258 --> 06:15.161
There's a great deal of evidence now that's piled up.

06:15.181 --> 06:24.312
In fact, it seems to have a rather negative effect to make students feel too good about themselves without any foundation, and also it has a

06:25.996 --> 06:37.268
paradoxical effect, enhancing students' self-esteem without student achievement actually begins making students feel worse about them.

06:37.288 --> 06:47.420
Do you, in fact, think of this phrase, dumbing down, which has come into prominence recently, do you see a trend?

06:48.641 --> 06:52.145
Do you, in fact, see some of this dumbing down going on?

06:52.445 --> 06:55.108
Yes, I do.

06:55.662 --> 06:58.845
points besides the test scores.

07:00.246 --> 07:18.884
One is that the dumbing down, which in my opinion is an emphasis on things other than subject matter in the schools, has been going on since the progressivists of the 1920s have grown in influence.

07:19.244 --> 07:23.728
That's by far the dominant influence in education schools and among teachers now.

07:24.181 --> 07:26.703
All the ones who believe differently have long retired.

07:27.984 --> 07:45.400
And so there is a tendency to trivialize knowledge, to say that it's nothing but trivial suits, that it's useless, it's here today, it's gone tomorrow, facts are changing so often that they're not important.

07:45.420 --> 07:51.606
And that anti-knowledge movement, which characterized aggressive movement in education,

07:52.463 --> 07:53.284
has taken home.

07:53.645 --> 08:00.695
And that dumbed down the schools considerably.

08:00.915 --> 08:04.621
But that's the source of it, according to it.

08:04.641 --> 08:07.565
The book essentially has a double focus.

08:07.745 --> 08:14.815
One is historical, and the other is scientific and research-oriented.

08:14.835 --> 08:19.382
It is interesting and encouraging, I would think.

08:19.666 --> 08:26.854
that this sequence of books that you've written has found a popular audience.

08:27.675 --> 08:29.457
You mean what your first reader and so on?

08:29.638 --> 08:30.519
Yeah.

08:30.719 --> 08:44.695
I mean, but these books have not been relegated, and I have the greatest respect for university presses, of course, but you certainly have found a responsive readership out there, haven't you?

08:44.675 --> 09:02.863
And the interesting thing is it's not just white middle class parents, but minority parents who are like these books and like the core knowledge schools where the core knowledge sequence is used.

09:03.023 --> 09:12.758
I think that the success of those schools lends a certain authority to what this book argues, which, by the way, is anyway based on

09:13.615 --> 09:16.251
pretty uncontrovertible.

09:17.260 --> 09:45.433
I mean, you certainly have given it a positive title, and it's very hopeful, but realistically, where do you see, I mean, do we need a seismic turn of a... Yes, you do, but it's a seismic turn not in willingness and energy to do things, which is there in the country, I think.

09:45.453 --> 09:45.833
But...

09:46.673 --> 09:57.852
a seismic change in ideas so that people can't get away with saying rote memorization, you know, just voicing.

09:58.312 --> 10:10.032
I would say the chief aim of this book is to inoculate the general public against the slogans that have been so successful and so successful as rhetoric and unsuccessful as rhetoric.

10:10.602 --> 10:11.082
policy.

10:11.903 --> 10:16.728
What are the principal obstacles in your view?

10:17.529 --> 10:18.810
Intellectual ones.

10:18.830 --> 10:20.092
That is resistance.

10:20.953 --> 10:22.654
By home, I mean, if you can be specific.

10:22.674 --> 10:23.655
By the people in power.

10:23.716 --> 10:32.685
That is the people, the superintendents, the departments of education, the program officers of foundations.

10:34.346 --> 10:36.829
There's what I call in the book a thought world.

10:37.720 --> 10:44.093
That's quite monolithic and which brooks no opposition.

10:44.454 --> 10:47.340
If you oppose it, you're morally culpable.

10:47.861 --> 10:55.737
For example, who would want to stand up among a group of educationists and say, I'm for, quote, rote memorization?

10:57.140 --> 10:58.142
Nobody would.

10:58.358 --> 11:01.663
And yet, nothing can be learned without being remembered.

11:02.385 --> 11:14.284
Yeah, I mean, every time I try out a new word processor or a computer, I always do the Gettysburg Address, you know, something I learned 40 years ago or whatever, you know.

11:15.085 --> 11:15.546
They don't do that.

11:15.566 --> 11:24.180
There's a great deal to be said for learning things by heart, of course, and there's a great deal to be said for all kinds of things that are disparaged.

11:24.683 --> 11:29.310
And that's what has to be turned around, in my opinion, more than anything else.

11:29.330 --> 11:46.995
Do you have a position in this whole debate, which I've certainly just recently become aware of, and in fact which I'm pursuing, and I'm just at the beginning of it from my own new book, this whole idea of the canon, you know, the literary...

11:47.887 --> 12:02.807
Well, I do have lots of ideas about cannons, and my sense is that a cannon is something that does get changed, but it doesn't get changed with great speed.

12:03.344 --> 12:06.568
Because and you don't want it to get changed.

12:06.628 --> 12:08.930
There are two kinds of canon I think you're talking about.

12:09.050 --> 12:15.878
One is the great books canon, which is more of a literary canon, so to speak.

12:16.719 --> 12:24.708
But there is another kind of canon, which is a canon of knowledge that a community or a society shares.

12:25.809 --> 12:29.233
And that's a canon, the literary canon,

12:29.652 --> 12:37.187
which may have always belonged, except for the Bible and Shakespeare, to just an elite.

12:37.248 --> 12:39.913
I mean, is Edith Wharton part of the canon?

12:39.953 --> 12:41.777
Who knows the works of Edith Wharton?

12:41.917 --> 12:43.881
Only a tiny elite.

12:44.553 --> 12:58.252
But I'll come back to Edith Wharton in a second, because there is a whole school of women's studies now, which is trying to develop its own canon of who belongs and who deserves entry.

13:00.375 --> 13:11.691
But that canon, in my mind, while it's important, is far less important than the canon of knowledge, because the canon of knowledge and vocabulary, as it were,

13:12.802 --> 13:16.546
enables strangers to communicate with one another.

13:18.028 --> 13:24.735
And that's what the schools have a responsibility to give everybody.

13:25.516 --> 13:27.498
Of course, that's what cultural literacy was all about.

13:27.558 --> 13:28.839
That's, of course, what it was about.

13:29.620 --> 13:37.409
In that book, I say there were two failures in American education, two guiding ideas that were wrong.

13:37.509 --> 13:40.412
One was formalism, and the other naturalism.

13:40.679 --> 13:47.489
Cultural literacy was attacking formalism, the emptying of content from education.

13:47.589 --> 13:56.563
And this book is attacking naturalism, which suggests that if you just grow naturally, you will automatically get educated.

13:56.643 --> 13:59.988
And if you do anything unnatural in school, it's bad.

14:00.889 --> 14:09.943
Well, that is as big a barrier to effective education as content.

14:10.565 --> 14:12.171
neutrality was.

14:12.488 --> 14:13.329
You know, I see.

14:13.489 --> 14:16.113
I'm an English major at a factory.

14:16.133 --> 14:17.495
Where are you in Maine, incidentally?

14:18.096 --> 14:19.097
It's called Christmas Cove.

14:19.598 --> 14:20.198
Uh-huh.

14:20.218 --> 14:25.145
I went to Bates up in Lewiston, which is a good little school.

14:25.245 --> 14:27.368
And we had these courses.

14:27.889 --> 14:34.618
I went in the 60s, early 60s, called Cultural Heritage, you know, for three years.

14:35.339 --> 14:41.247
And, of course, I was an English major, and therefore I took a full year of Shakespeare, the greatest course I've ever taken.

14:41.227 --> 14:50.925
And now I read, just last year or the year before, that you can actually get a degree in English literature from Georgetown and not be required to study Shakespeare.

14:54.211 --> 14:54.933
Amazing to me.

14:54.953 --> 15:03.589
I hope there will be a reaction against it, and I'm going in just a few days to a group of

15:04.261 --> 15:05.283
literary scholars.

15:06.165 --> 15:07.868
Are you going to this conference in Boston?

15:08.670 --> 15:10.734
I'm a member of that society as well.

15:11.476 --> 15:15.103
I'm a charter member actually myself.

15:15.203 --> 15:19.772
I joined when they put that ad in the New York Review.

15:19.813 --> 15:25.003
I'm wondering if this might be a fruitful thing for me to attend.

15:24.983 --> 15:29.887
If only just to see how these... I haven't attended any yet.

15:29.907 --> 15:31.209
This is going to be my first one.

15:31.229 --> 15:32.410
I think this is only the second one.

15:33.230 --> 15:33.991
Yeah, that's right.

15:34.071 --> 15:35.292
Last year was in Minneapolis.

15:35.392 --> 15:35.773
Right.

15:35.793 --> 15:36.894
So you're coming down to that.

15:37.114 --> 15:39.396
Yeah, I'm planning to.

15:39.416 --> 15:43.480
I might just call today, and I think I could probably still register.

15:43.520 --> 15:44.360
Swiss Hotel.

15:44.481 --> 15:45.201
I'm sure you can.

15:45.261 --> 15:47.523
I don't think most academics can afford to.

15:48.324 --> 15:49.505
Well, it's close to me.

15:49.885 --> 15:52.728
It's only 55 bucks to register.

15:52.948 --> 15:53.809
Whatever, yeah.

15:54.346 --> 15:56.231
And for me, it's a 45-minute drive.

15:56.351 --> 15:57.634
Oh, where are you?

15:58.236 --> 15:59.799
I'm out near Worcester.

15:59.920 --> 16:00.601
Oh, yeah, sure.

16:00.641 --> 16:01.864
That would be worth doing.

16:01.884 --> 16:02.666
In Grafton.

16:02.726 --> 16:03.990
This is my base.

16:04.892 --> 16:06.015
I'm sorry, where were I?

16:06.716 --> 16:09.503
So now what do you expect to do?

16:09.483 --> 16:14.770
Speaking of this conference, what do you expect to glean from this?

16:15.491 --> 16:15.832
Nothing.

16:15.872 --> 16:20.459
I just want to see old friends and get back into the academic swing a little bit.

16:20.479 --> 16:23.242
I've been involved in school reform so long.

16:24.084 --> 16:25.205
What's your sense?

16:25.225 --> 16:29.491
I'm not asking you to comment on this organization, but it does seem to be a reaction to things.

16:29.511 --> 16:30.272
That's right.

16:30.292 --> 16:30.513
Yes.

16:31.194 --> 16:34.258
And the idea that there are

16:34.441 --> 16:38.079
Some works are in the canon because they're better than others.

16:38.159 --> 16:42.038
That's one of the ideas that is behind this.

16:42.254 --> 16:45.519
But, I mean, now there's a book I just received.

16:45.539 --> 16:52.129
In fact, yesterday came in the same mail as yours, and it's about a... I'm trying to find it.

16:52.149 --> 16:53.671
You're only getting my book to you right now?

16:54.372 --> 16:55.755
I just got it yesterday.

16:56.115 --> 16:57.097
Isn't that awful?

16:57.117 --> 17:07.873
Yeah, that's why, I mean, if it's... I think Doubleday is the word... If it sounds like I'm... Like I said, please forgive me for sounding... The publicity office, I mean, they're really pretty...

17:07.853 --> 17:10.156
I mean, you have to forgive.

17:10.197 --> 17:12.600
In fact, today is my deadline for getting my column out.

17:12.640 --> 17:15.805
So I've been focused on getting this week's piece out.

17:16.206 --> 17:22.375
So I really haven't had the time, you know, that I need to commit myself to your book here.

17:22.455 --> 17:31.228
And that's why if it sounds like these questions are vague and naive, it's because, you know, I just really got the package yesterday.

17:31.208 --> 17:37.599
So I assure you it'll be thoroughly written and I... Isn't that interesting?

17:37.659 --> 17:40.885
When did they say they were going to send it to you?

17:40.905 --> 17:51.363
Well, I also have to, in their defense, I talked to Marley Rousseff just last week and she told me this, I pursued this, not the other way around.

17:53.186 --> 17:56.592
And so she thought it would be a very good idea and so we just...

17:56.572 --> 17:59.858
I mean, we just put this thing together, like, within the last four or five days.

18:00.399 --> 18:03.746
Whatever they called you was probably 45 minutes after they talked to me.

18:04.728 --> 18:08.395
And they probably just talked to you a couple days ago already.

18:08.415 --> 18:13.264
So it is just kind of, I see it as a perfect piece to run the first week of September.

18:13.685 --> 18:13.905
Yeah, sure.

18:14.425 --> 18:16.929
And I was looking for something.

18:16.949 --> 18:21.838
I'm making a West Coast trip that week, and I'm very happy to get something out.

18:23.120 --> 18:23.681
I'm curious.

18:23.901 --> 18:26.526
I wonder, is there a number in Virginia where I can reach you?

18:26.646 --> 18:27.207
Yeah, sure.

18:27.267 --> 18:28.970
You can call me again.

18:28.990 --> 18:32.316
We don't need to extend this because it might be better.

18:32.296 --> 18:34.379
to assimilate.

18:34.439 --> 18:41.528
I mean, I've given you a few things about my main, well, I don't know whether I've mentioned my main motivation.

18:41.548 --> 18:42.629
And I think we should do that.

18:42.789 --> 18:50.760
Writing this book was the really intellectual change, change ideas, change people's minds.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.103
It's got to be a long-range thing.

18:53.163 --> 18:57.308
I don't see any significant improvement coming without

18:58.098 --> 19:06.065
real debate and change of ideas, and including change among the education people themselves.

19:06.085 --> 19:08.707
If that isn't encouraged, I don't know how it's going to happen.

19:09.368 --> 19:18.215
And I am encouraged to think that it could happen, because we have now more than 300 core knowledge schools in 40 states.

19:19.216 --> 19:22.859
And you've been quite directly involved in this, haven't you?

19:23.019 --> 19:23.219
Sure.

19:23.239 --> 19:24.881
I mean, this is your baby, actually.

19:24.901 --> 19:27.683
That core knowledge movement, yeah.

19:28.220 --> 19:29.381
from my foundation.

19:29.481 --> 19:31.724
And what do you see from that?

19:31.744 --> 19:35.168
I mean, is it, you said how many, 300?

19:35.228 --> 19:39.252
Well, I think it means that the teachers are quite pragmatic just the way I am.

19:39.593 --> 19:43.917
And their indoctrination does not run deep.

19:43.937 --> 19:45.239
They want to do what works.

19:46.781 --> 19:53.468
Whereas education professors tend to have their egos and their home.

19:53.752 --> 19:57.838
self-identity mixed up with this system of ideas that is wrong.

20:00.602 --> 20:04.568
And my hope is that eventually there'll be some dissent in those ranks as well.

20:05.329 --> 20:11.477
How about with these groups that you work with, what do you see happening with reading skills for children?

20:11.578 --> 20:21.632
Well, they've declined and partly it's going to

20:21.933 --> 20:30.651
lower vocabulary, which has declined because of less knowledge.

20:30.691 --> 20:33.176
I mean, knowledge and vocabulary are correlative.

20:34.979 --> 20:43.857
And the other reason was the whole language movement, which has been discredited now.

20:44.933 --> 20:53.903
And just to go back briefly, we're talking about this group in Boston, the AC.

20:55.325 --> 21:04.275
We did agree that this was established more or less as a reaction to... A counter-MLA, I think.

21:05.036 --> 21:09.861
And do you have a position on this, on the MLA and...

21:11.107 --> 21:13.631
Well, I thought I'd agree with Christopher Ricks.

21:13.751 --> 21:17.137
He was one of the founding fathers of this group.

21:17.157 --> 21:21.945
And he said the problem with the MLA isn't that it's political.

21:22.306 --> 21:26.513
The problem is that it doesn't commit anything except the political.

21:26.973 --> 21:30.760
And he expressed it better than that.

21:31.861 --> 21:32.803
But I think it's right.

21:33.144 --> 21:35.447
But that's basically what the attitude is.

21:35.748 --> 21:35.848
Yeah.

21:36.841 --> 21:38.924
Could you give me a number where I can reach you?

21:39.966 --> 21:40.106
Yeah.

21:40.126 --> 21:41.088
In Charlottesville or wherever?

21:42.090 --> 21:47.178
Probably the best place is home, and it's 804-296-2631.

21:48.580 --> 21:51.045
Okay.

21:51.726 --> 21:59.318
I will be coming down to Charlottesville, and I can't say precisely when, but to work on this new book.

21:59.378 --> 22:03.405
I want to see Terry Ballinger over at the university, and...

22:03.385 --> 22:07.070
Perhaps if you're around me, we can get together.

22:07.250 --> 22:07.710
Oh, sure.

22:07.770 --> 22:08.692
I would look forward to it.

22:08.712 --> 22:10.193
And I'll give you an idea precisely.

22:10.213 --> 22:12.036
I'll have a better idea of where I'm going.

22:12.396 --> 22:19.385
And maybe if I do, in fact, go to that conference this weekend, I'll try and... One quick question.

22:19.405 --> 22:20.146
How do people dress?

22:20.186 --> 22:23.129
How do academics dress for summer conferences?

22:23.330 --> 22:23.870
I don't know.

22:23.890 --> 22:25.092
I'm bringing a thing.

22:25.472 --> 22:30.979
I never went to such a thing, and I'm bringing both casual and non-casual things.

22:31.212 --> 22:33.656
I'm going to look around and see.

22:33.676 --> 22:36.319
I'd feel like a fool going to dress in a suit.

22:36.400 --> 22:43.510
But I think it would be well to bring a coat and tie because God only knows as they're claiming to be.

22:43.870 --> 22:49.218
But they might then dress very casually to prove that they're not all that conservative.

22:49.238 --> 22:50.120
I have no idea.

22:50.140 --> 22:51.522
I figured you'd know.

22:53.164 --> 22:56.769
I know some of them being coats and ties because some of my colleagues are that way.

22:57.310 --> 22:59.413
But not necessarily the group.

22:59.950 --> 23:09.001
Well, I think I'm going to call them right now and maybe register and show up because I think I'd really be angry with my... I'm going to shut this tape.

23:09.101 --> 23:09.621
It's rolling.

23:10.342 --> 23:10.643
Good.

23:11.784 --> 23:13.947
So let's talk a little bit.

23:15.248 --> 23:15.749
Okay.

23:15.769 --> 23:25.140
First of all, I want to tell you what probably you already know that the TV crew is coming from Holland.

23:25.160 --> 23:25.300
Uh-huh.

23:25.870 --> 23:26.651
You know that.

23:26.671 --> 23:37.484
I know that, and he sent me a fax yesterday, and he asked me to try and come up with somebody else for him, and I think I have somebody who will be terrific for him.

23:38.526 --> 23:54.966
A woman from Switzerland by the name of Christina Johnson, who married into the Johnson & Johnson family and put together this unbelievable collection of whaling, which is going to be sold at Swan Gallery, so I'm going to send a fax off to him about that.

23:55.553 --> 23:57.395
So apparently he said he's coming in October.

23:57.736 --> 24:00.900
Now, who is the one whom he drops?

24:00.920 --> 24:04.163
Well, he didn't drop, but Mrs. Taper, Louise Taper.

24:05.045 --> 24:06.887
I guess she decided she doesn't want to do it.

24:08.028 --> 24:09.210
That's the Lincoln lady?

24:09.230 --> 24:09.450
Yeah.

24:09.991 --> 24:19.542
He didn't say why, but I know Louise is kind of fickle, shall we say, and I'm sure for reasons of her own she's decided against it.

24:21.384 --> 24:24.328
But, you know, the only person she's ever talked to is me.

24:25.034 --> 24:28.778
So it doesn't surprise me that she decided against it.

24:28.798 --> 24:31.781
But I think this other woman will be better, actually.

24:32.923 --> 24:39.690
I mean, if it's possible for anybody to be wealthier than Mrs. Taper, I think this woman is, and she certainly has indulged her passion.

24:39.710 --> 24:42.854
And there are a lot of European resonances to her collection, too.

24:43.715 --> 24:50.302
You know that the big boss in Chicago used to throw human clothes his nose.

24:50.322 --> 24:51.063
Oh, I didn't know.

24:52.044 --> 24:52.965
And I think

24:53.873 --> 25:03.182
If somebody wants to... You know, I'm taking them to Ralph Newman's home to see his private collection.

25:03.462 --> 25:03.642
Uh-huh.

25:04.423 --> 25:05.624
Slash for sale.

25:06.005 --> 25:06.425
Really?

25:07.346 --> 25:10.889
Yeah, because... Did you start the program you made with me?

25:11.590 --> 25:12.491
Uh-huh.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.293
Did you start the program?

25:14.313 --> 25:14.893
I didn't, no.

25:14.913 --> 25:15.334
I'm sorry.

25:16.375 --> 25:16.915
Uh-huh.

25:16.935 --> 25:18.497
Okay, I will send you a copy.

25:18.517 --> 25:18.797
Okay.

25:19.357 --> 25:21.079
Now, he's closed down, huh?

25:22.679 --> 25:24.101
How old is he now, Lou?

25:24.141 --> 25:26.124
He must be in his 90s, huh?

25:26.144 --> 25:27.786
No, he's mid-80s.

25:28.707 --> 25:30.450
I should probably talk to him, don't you think?

25:31.511 --> 25:34.996
If I would be you, I definitely would.

25:35.116 --> 25:35.977
Is he in good health?

25:38.160 --> 25:42.085
Let me check out the situation.

25:42.987 --> 25:44.028
I'd like to talk to him.

25:44.068 --> 25:46.311
I bet you he'd have a lot of interesting stories for me.

25:46.451 --> 25:46.932
Absolutely.

25:47.705 --> 25:56.858
He has a customer, a good, very wealthy customer, who buys only 11 or 12th edition of books.

25:56.878 --> 25:57.419
I'm sorry.

25:57.439 --> 25:59.362
Because he is a nut.

26:00.163 --> 26:08.635
And he tells to a new one, Ralph, every goddamn shitty book has a first edition.

26:08.655 --> 26:09.877
Ralph has a first edition.

26:10.498 --> 26:13.422
What if a book is 12th edition?

26:13.442 --> 26:14.844
That must be something.

26:16.447 --> 26:17.408
That's funny.

26:17.607 --> 26:19.530
Can you know he's right on Monday?

26:21.293 --> 26:27.482
I wonder, it's hard for me to say when I could get out to Chicago.

26:27.602 --> 26:31.688
I certainly know I'm coming out for... I'm sure you will be here.

26:31.708 --> 26:36.055
Well, I'll be out there at the ABA, I know, for next year, but I'd like to do it before that, too.

26:36.996 --> 26:37.096
Sure.

26:37.116 --> 26:41.663
Now, the other thing is what I want to talk to you about.

26:44.187 --> 26:44.948
True friends.

26:45.451 --> 26:51.376
of friends, I made acquaintance with a man whose name is Dr. Mayer Maynor.

26:53.058 --> 26:55.920
M-A-Y-E-R.

26:57.301 --> 26:58.703
M-A-Y-N-O-R.

26:59.103 --> 26:59.463
Okay.

27:00.304 --> 27:00.844
Meyer.

27:01.365 --> 27:05.028
M-A-Y-E-R.

27:05.048 --> 27:06.790
Okay.

27:06.810 --> 27:08.331
He is junior.

27:09.552 --> 27:15.197
He is the president of Illinois Wesleyan University.

27:15.217 --> 27:15.357
Mm-hmm.

27:15.910 --> 27:20.957
And he's a fabulous book collector.

27:20.977 --> 27:29.189
But kind of a, you know, he is not a public book collector.

27:29.209 --> 27:33.536
He's a very private person.

27:33.556 --> 27:38.122
And he's a book collector with tremendous knowledge.

27:39.905 --> 27:43.470
I would like you and him to meet here.

27:44.277 --> 27:47.461
next time when you are here.

27:47.481 --> 27:57.455
And I would like to, you know, he gets your book from me so he knows about you as I talk about you a lot.

27:57.475 --> 27:58.657
I've got a question for you.

27:59.438 --> 28:02.622
How far is Chicago from Detroit?

28:04.805 --> 28:06.387
By plane, 30 minutes.

28:06.653 --> 28:08.857
Well, I've got to come out to Detroit in November.

28:09.538 --> 28:11.661
Maybe I could come to Chicago a day earlier.

28:11.701 --> 28:13.324
Absolutely.

28:13.344 --> 28:17.772
And then just shoot up to Detroit and come back home from Detroit.

28:18.393 --> 28:18.573
Sure.

28:19.194 --> 28:19.514
You know?

28:20.115 --> 28:20.276
Sure.

28:20.817 --> 28:25.244
And these, you know, maybe I could, that's the way to do it, don't you think?

28:25.805 --> 28:26.506
I think so.

28:26.526 --> 28:28.810
And maybe I could do Ralph Newman on that same trip.

28:29.211 --> 28:29.932
And you know what?

28:30.533 --> 28:33.117
You can sleep here one night with us.

28:33.518 --> 28:35.822
Oh, I wouldn't want to impose on you like that.

28:36.343 --> 28:40.571
Well, I'm not talking about imposing.

28:40.591 --> 28:44.879
I'm talking about, I don't know about you, but my time is money.

28:46.903 --> 28:54.818
And if I can sit and talk during the time that you spend on a taxi going to a hotel,

28:55.608 --> 28:56.689
You know what I mean?

28:56.709 --> 28:57.369
Yeah, good.

28:59.211 --> 29:02.994
Then there is no imposement to send a delivery to life.

29:03.014 --> 29:04.155
Well, let's take a look at it.

29:06.677 --> 29:10.320
Right now, I got five talks set up in October.

29:11.001 --> 29:13.883
I'm doing the Library of Congress, the Rofont Club.

29:15.024 --> 29:18.948
I'm doing the Library Company of Philadelphia.

29:20.149 --> 29:25.513
Then, in November, this is November now, I'm going to, I'm doing,

29:26.962 --> 29:31.609
the Friends of the Detroit Public Library on November the 21st.

29:32.230 --> 29:47.955
Now, I could come out, say, for... I could come out, like, maybe early in the morning of the 20th, either stay the night of the 20th, fly to Chicago on the morning of the 21st.

29:48.055 --> 29:50.539
I'm sorry, what?

29:50.840 --> 29:59.130
Shariu, pick up the phone for a minute while you and I are talking about this particular thing.

29:59.150 --> 29:59.450
Okay.

30:01.052 --> 30:06.098
Oh, she cannot pick up the phone.

30:06.118 --> 30:08.320
Shariu, you just write down this.

30:09.181 --> 30:12.145
November 20th, early morning.

30:13.226 --> 30:15.008
Beth Bain perhaps arrives.

30:15.798 --> 30:17.520
Let's say the earliest flight up there.

30:17.641 --> 30:22.387
And we have flights that start at 8 o'clock, so I could be there at 9 o'clock in the morning, you know?

30:22.407 --> 30:23.629
Yeah, yeah.

30:23.649 --> 30:32.241
And we will try to stay together with Minor, Dr. Minor.

30:32.341 --> 30:33.102
Minor?

30:34.985 --> 30:35.345
Minor?

30:36.086 --> 30:37.448
And I would stay that one night?

30:37.769 --> 30:38.650
Yeah.

30:38.670 --> 30:42.035
And then I would get the earliest plane out the next day to Detroit?

30:42.415 --> 30:43.817
Yeah.

30:43.837 --> 30:44.598
Is that a good idea?

30:45.039 --> 30:45.720
Very good idea.

30:46.291 --> 30:48.298
In July, this is now August, September.

30:48.318 --> 30:52.191
It's three months, but that gives us plenty of time to set this up.

30:52.211 --> 30:54.298
November 20th.

30:55.903 --> 30:57.629
That's a Wednesday, November 20th.

30:57.890 --> 30:58.933
Wednesday, yeah.

30:59.673 --> 31:23.858
Um you know Ralph Newman right after my book came out he wrote me a letter, a fan letter. Yeah. He loved it and he said gee he'd love to talk to me so he knows about my book and he wants to talk to me. I talked to him two three times about your book. So uh you know maybe if I could get a two-hour session with him. Yeah. And then maybe a two-hour session with this other gentleman.

31:24.580 --> 31:25.502
Yeah.

31:25.642 --> 31:28.627
And then maybe it's come some time with you.

31:29.568 --> 31:29.669
Yeah.

31:29.689 --> 31:30.911
This is the way I like it, you know?

31:31.412 --> 31:31.852
Okay.

31:32.173 --> 31:33.495
Now, another thing.

31:33.696 --> 31:34.076
Okay.

31:34.317 --> 31:36.220
I need you as a friend.

31:36.240 --> 31:37.061
You are my friend.

31:38.023 --> 31:38.343
I am?

31:38.884 --> 31:39.145
Yes.

31:39.345 --> 31:40.607
You know, a friend is need.

31:40.627 --> 31:43.132
Is a friend indeed.

31:43.272 --> 31:43.773
There you go.

31:45.556 --> 31:48.681
I would like you to review the shrub box.

31:50.686 --> 31:52.931
Could you do that for me?

31:53.051 --> 31:54.674
The Katarina Schroft book?

31:54.955 --> 31:55.155
Yeah.

31:55.636 --> 31:56.838
I haven't seen it yet, you know.

31:57.279 --> 31:58.201
You sent me a copy.

31:58.221 --> 31:59.023
You did send me that?

31:59.303 --> 32:00.646
You thanked for it.

32:00.666 --> 32:01.628
Okay, okay, I did, okay.

32:01.648 --> 32:03.692
I thought this is not something that just came out now.

32:04.353 --> 32:07.059
It just came out.

32:07.079 --> 32:08.121
Okay, then I have it.

32:09.923 --> 32:13.727
But, you know, if you cannot locate it, I said... No, no, no, no, no.

32:13.767 --> 32:20.215
My wife takes care of all that stuff, so if I thank you for it, we have it.

32:20.235 --> 32:20.655
For sure.

32:20.695 --> 32:24.459
Well, you mentioned when you've been here in Chicago.

32:24.479 --> 32:24.780
I did.

32:24.820 --> 32:25.320
Okay.

32:25.741 --> 32:26.522
Let me take a look.

32:27.102 --> 32:28.184
It just came out, right?

32:28.244 --> 32:29.125
I'm sure we have it.

32:29.505 --> 32:31.527
You said you thanked for it.

32:31.547 --> 32:33.089
If I thanked you for it, I've got it.

32:33.469 --> 32:33.910
Yeah.

32:33.930 --> 32:34.290
Okay.

32:36.773 --> 32:37.534
We have...

32:38.020 --> 32:42.165
I have difficulties with the publisher.

32:42.185 --> 32:44.928
And the book was not reviewed anywhere yet.

32:48.332 --> 32:53.378
And I produced some interesting reviews.

32:55.561 --> 32:55.781
You know?

32:55.901 --> 32:58.244
We're off the beaten path.

32:59.345 --> 33:06.053
Like Stanley Marks reviewed it in his column in the Dallas newspaper.

33:07.822 --> 33:22.919
And the former diplomat, the Hungarian, who writes for the biggest Hungarian weekly in the United States, wrote a good review about what nobody book you.

33:25.102 --> 33:29.627
Well, the only problem is who would I review it for?

33:30.232 --> 33:33.055
Don't you have some kind of a column?

33:33.075 --> 33:36.919
I have a column, but it's not a, you know, again, it's not a review kind of a thing.

33:36.959 --> 33:39.342
Let me look at the book and see what I can do.

33:39.642 --> 33:40.803
I'm sure I can do something.

33:40.963 --> 33:43.005
What does your column do?

33:43.025 --> 33:57.100
My column is more of a, you know, it's a mainstream literary feature where I do people like Mario Puzo and Doris Lessing and, you know, the new big books that are out.

33:57.535 --> 34:08.856
at a particular time for, you know, George Higgins or Toni Morrison, you know, and it's usually a feature on the individual and the book.

34:09.637 --> 34:12.743
But again, you know, let me see what I can do.

34:12.763 --> 34:14.346
Could you do a feature on me?

34:15.085 --> 34:19.710
I'm just fearful that people are going to know what I'm doing.

34:19.730 --> 34:25.577
I'm just fearful that people are going to know that I'm writing about somebody that I've written about in my book.

34:25.637 --> 34:26.037
That's all.

34:26.718 --> 34:28.280
But let me look at it.

34:29.021 --> 34:30.022
Let me see what I can do.

34:31.344 --> 34:32.945
Let me explore this, okay?

34:33.466 --> 34:34.968
Sure.

34:37.711 --> 34:38.832
Let me explore it.

34:39.200 --> 34:40.061
Yeah.

34:40.081 --> 34:43.266
Maybe, because I've written about you already.

34:43.486 --> 34:47.151
You know, we should do this book for the Biblio magazine, too, you know?

34:48.673 --> 34:48.813
Uh-huh.

34:48.833 --> 34:49.514
Don't you think so?

34:50.776 --> 34:52.378
Could you do it for the Biblio?

34:52.558 --> 34:53.960
Yeah, now that I could definitely do.

34:54.221 --> 34:56.924
That would be fabulous for me.

34:56.985 --> 34:57.686
Would that be good?

34:58.086 --> 35:00.249
Oh, sure.

35:00.349 --> 35:02.612
Because I write a regular column for them now.

35:03.073 --> 35:03.594
Yes.

35:03.614 --> 35:07.499
And she does, she takes what I tell her to take, you know?

35:07.780 --> 35:08.160
Yeah.

35:08.849 --> 35:13.294
And, you know, I can give you a very interesting angle.

35:13.674 --> 35:14.094
Okay.

35:15.176 --> 35:15.976
You know what I mean?

35:16.277 --> 35:16.497
Sure.

35:16.517 --> 35:20.081
I give you a very interesting angle.

35:20.101 --> 35:21.382
Let's do it that way, okay?

35:21.642 --> 35:22.583
Okay.

35:22.603 --> 35:24.545
That would be better for me.

35:24.666 --> 35:35.056
And it would be good for me, too, because, you know, it would be difficult to change, you know, all of a sudden do something different from what I do.

35:35.757 --> 35:36.098
Yeah.

35:36.118 --> 35:36.578
You know?

35:37.148 --> 35:39.292
So, but I'd be happy to do it for Biblio.

35:40.353 --> 35:40.513
Sure.

35:41.295 --> 35:42.857
I'll call them, in fact, immediately.

35:44.119 --> 35:47.044
It may be too late to get it into the third issue, but we'll see.

35:47.184 --> 35:49.067
No, put it in the fourth issue.

35:49.088 --> 35:49.969
Well, then that's great.

35:49.989 --> 35:51.171
That'll give me plenty of time.

35:51.692 --> 35:56.760
Because you tell them that I just started the article by Louis.

35:58.327 --> 36:00.510
I know he's a member of the advisory.

36:00.871 --> 36:03.014
I don't even have to go that far with him, Louis.

36:03.876 --> 36:05.678
They'll do it if I tell them to do it.

36:05.698 --> 36:06.500
Yeah.

36:06.520 --> 36:08.923
If I offer to give them a story, they'll take it.

36:09.945 --> 36:11.107
They'll take anything I write.

36:11.587 --> 36:19.059
And you know, the book has an author up front, not me.

36:19.079 --> 36:19.459
The what?

36:20.241 --> 36:21.803
I am just co-author.

36:22.205 --> 36:23.887
Yeah, don't worry about it.

36:23.927 --> 36:28.833
This is perfect for us, because it has all kinds of antiquarian applications, too.

36:29.013 --> 36:30.555
Absolutely.

36:30.575 --> 36:31.296
Absolutely.

36:31.316 --> 36:32.758
That's what you can make.

36:32.778 --> 36:39.606
You can say that all of a sudden is a big interest in antiquarian bookshops.

36:40.087 --> 36:46.575
Books about Franz Joseph and his time are back.

36:46.595 --> 36:50.119
Why don't you jot some of these things down for me?

36:50.234 --> 36:51.837
That's what I will do.

36:51.857 --> 36:54.702
And you can fax them to me or mail them to me or whatever?

36:54.843 --> 37:05.603
Well, the reason is that there is a new book which made such an interest that Stanley Marcus in his column in the Dallas News wrote about it.

37:06.545 --> 37:09.450
And blah, blah, blah.

37:09.470 --> 37:12.175
And that's the book and that's the angle.

37:12.593 --> 37:13.754
I'll do it, okay?

37:13.935 --> 37:17.819
For Biblio, and it'll be... She'll do it.

37:17.859 --> 37:20.042
I'll just say I'm going to write the story.

37:21.123 --> 37:22.965
And it won't be as part of my column.

37:22.985 --> 37:24.047
It'll be like a book review.

37:25.008 --> 37:30.775
Now, as far as your two books, what are the... One book is on libraries in Europe?

37:30.795 --> 37:33.658
Well, it's more than that, but that's going to be a chapter in the book.

37:33.979 --> 37:37.062
Okay, so what will be the whole book?

37:37.563 --> 37:40.086
The whole book is going to be about book culture...

37:40.673 --> 37:42.215
You know, books of the future.

37:42.977 --> 37:49.167
It's not going to be just about collecting, although there will be chapters on collectors.

37:49.207 --> 37:54.495
You know, I'm very, very interested in... How well do you know Jim Dunley?

37:54.515 --> 37:55.036
I don't know him.

37:56.678 --> 38:01.947
Jim Dunley is a publisher who is not a publisher.

38:01.967 --> 38:03.289
He is a printer.

38:03.522 --> 38:04.684
There in Chicago?

38:05.305 --> 38:08.449
No, on four continents.

38:08.469 --> 38:10.533
He prints in 22 countries.

38:10.553 --> 38:10.973
Wow.

38:11.915 --> 38:13.397
And he's a friend of mine.

38:13.417 --> 38:15.100
And aren't they based in Chicago, though?

38:15.761 --> 38:15.901
Sure.

38:16.622 --> 38:19.506
Doesn't he have a daughter who's a member of the Caxton Club?

38:22.210 --> 38:24.794
Jim and his wife are both members.

38:25.555 --> 38:29.101
There was a young woman there, and I think she's the fourth generation Donnelly.

38:29.662 --> 38:30.002
Yes.

38:30.539 --> 38:31.940
That's probably his daughter.

38:31.960 --> 38:36.205
And she was kind of a pretty woman, and she was there, and she introduced herself to me, as I recall.

38:36.886 --> 38:41.611
Well, Jim Dundee is a good friend of mine since 20-some years.

38:41.631 --> 38:44.434
Well, I'd be pleased to... I'm looking for any ideas.

38:44.474 --> 38:45.655
I'm really looking for thoughts.

38:46.456 --> 38:49.199
I told you I'm planning to do something on Sarajevo.

38:49.679 --> 38:50.360
Yes.

38:50.380 --> 38:58.268
That's going to be a terrific chapter, you know, because when we talk about the course that the future can take... It makes...

38:59.058 --> 39:02.122
Hitler's book burning chicken shit.

39:02.262 --> 39:02.783
Exactly.

39:03.043 --> 39:06.548
And it makes Stalin's book burning chicken shit.

39:06.568 --> 39:06.989
Exactly.

39:07.009 --> 39:07.549
And you know what?

39:07.569 --> 39:10.013
This story hasn't been told in the United States.

39:10.353 --> 39:11.975
That's right.

39:12.055 --> 39:19.546
It's like it was not told that Mao destroyed all the books in the main library in Peking.

39:20.266 --> 39:24.752
I was there on the ruins and they wouldn't let me make a picture.

39:25.273 --> 39:25.634
Really?

39:26.275 --> 39:26.635
Sure.

39:27.644 --> 39:30.247
That trash was three floors high.

39:30.407 --> 39:30.947
Wow.

39:32.489 --> 39:33.710
Three floors high.

39:34.110 --> 39:35.832
Huh.

39:35.892 --> 39:36.232
Yeah.

39:36.312 --> 39:43.059
Now, you sent me a beautiful book on Hungary, which I have, which will be a reference for this.

39:43.219 --> 39:54.630
Can you think of any really notable other European collections, libraries in particular that have been so critical in the preservation of knowledge and history and culture?

39:54.965 --> 39:56.046
Certainly.

39:56.066 --> 40:04.136
And I can send you to book dealers whose grandfather sold books to me.

40:06.218 --> 40:07.259
You know what I mean?

40:07.279 --> 40:08.100
Yeah, yeah.

40:08.120 --> 40:21.817
I can introduce you to people like the Nebuchadnezzar, like the Hercs, like the Rappaport in Rome and in Vienna and in London, you know?

40:22.978 --> 40:24.820
And that gives you another angle.

40:25.103 --> 40:27.247
to write on this type of book trade.

40:28.750 --> 40:31.976
You know, I'm also going to have a chapter on, you know Barney Rosenthal?

40:32.857 --> 40:34.440
I know the name, certainly.

40:34.460 --> 40:37.365
Barney, he's a Berkeley, California bookseller?

40:37.726 --> 40:38.948
Yes.

40:38.968 --> 40:45.981
He did a lecture at Columbia University on the emigre booksellers who were forced out of Germany by Hitler.

40:46.383 --> 40:48.546
And from Austria by the same guy.

40:48.686 --> 40:49.167
Exactly.

40:49.687 --> 40:50.909
I'm going to do a chapter on them.

40:50.949 --> 40:54.734
I'm going to interview as many of these living booksellers as I can find.

40:54.874 --> 40:57.658
Unfortunately, Michael Trent already died.

40:57.798 --> 40:58.459
And who was that?

40:59.280 --> 41:09.353
He was a bookseller who had his principal story in Vienna, but he also had a book in Budapest, a story in Budapest.

41:09.373 --> 41:10.174
And what was his name?

41:11.215 --> 41:14.079
His name was, I just want to tell you the name.

41:14.199 --> 41:15.681
I know it's his childhood.

41:16.522 --> 41:23.774
He died in New York, you know, I think.

41:23.794 --> 41:28.261
I bought books from him here in this country.

41:29.663 --> 41:32.849
His name will come up.

41:32.909 --> 41:43.125
Yeah.

41:43.145 --> 41:43.626
I will...

41:43.927 --> 41:46.591
I will call her back in three, four minutes.

41:47.713 --> 41:50.417
I don't want to interrupt.

41:50.437 --> 41:52.460
So anyway, you're talking about a bookseller?

41:52.980 --> 41:54.322
Yeah, yeah.

41:54.343 --> 41:56.786
And his name will come up.

41:56.986 --> 41:57.667
Okay.

41:57.688 --> 41:59.170
When you think of it, jot it down.

41:59.971 --> 42:00.372
I will.

42:01.233 --> 42:04.177
I will have here an envelope for this.

42:04.678 --> 42:05.339
Okay.

42:05.359 --> 42:09.445
And really jot down your thoughts on the Katarina book.

42:09.728 --> 42:10.851
Yeah, sure.

42:10.992 --> 42:18.192
And as soon as we finish this phone call, I'm going to call Amy in Oregon and tell her I'm doing a review of this book for her.

42:18.653 --> 42:19.555
Yeah.

42:19.576 --> 42:20.338
I'm not going to ask her.

42:20.358 --> 42:20.959
I'm going to tell her.

42:21.441 --> 42:22.965
Yeah, yeah.

42:22.985 --> 42:23.687
Don't you think?

42:24.173 --> 42:31.723
Maybe what I'll do actually is I'll pick, there are three or four wonderful books, new books with antiquarian implications.

42:32.524 --> 42:32.604
Yes.

42:32.624 --> 42:34.747
And I could make like a little roundup for her.

42:35.908 --> 42:36.228
That's terrific.

42:36.248 --> 42:41.435
And that way, you know, this is one of several because there are some wonderful, wonderful brand new books.

42:42.757 --> 42:43.157
Yeah.

42:43.177 --> 42:43.678
Delightful.

42:43.958 --> 42:46.482
And of course your book is quite reasonably priced.

42:46.542 --> 42:50.887
Your book might be the bargain of the whole lot.

42:51.128 --> 42:51.788
You know what I'm saying?

42:51.828 --> 42:53.050
I'm sure it will be.

42:53.384 --> 42:56.588
And maybe that would be the angle there, one of the lines there, too.

42:57.750 --> 42:58.451
I'll do something.

42:59.192 --> 43:00.654
You can count on me.

43:00.694 --> 43:05.881
Now, the next book, I'm going out.

43:05.962 --> 43:12.431
I had a wonderful interview last week with Paul LeClaire, who's the president of the New York Public Library.

43:13.752 --> 43:17.738
And when I went into his office, he had two copies of A Gentle Madness there.

43:18.427 --> 43:20.389
And he said, would you inscribe these, please?

43:20.429 --> 43:21.169
I said, certainly.

43:21.750 --> 43:28.456
One is for Bill Blass, who gave the library $10 million, and the other was for Brooke Astor.

43:29.557 --> 43:31.719
And he said, gee, you should talk to Brooke Astor.

43:31.799 --> 43:33.881
I said, well, I don't know if she'd talk to me.

43:33.921 --> 43:35.202
He says, I will arrange it for you.

43:36.643 --> 43:38.385
So we're getting there, huh?

43:38.405 --> 43:39.646
It's picking up a little bit.

43:40.767 --> 43:46.172
And I think this book's going to be every bit as good as A Gentle Madness may be better.

43:46.675 --> 43:48.097
I'm really excited about it.

43:48.538 --> 44:02.277
And you know, the other thing, I think that for Biblio, you should start to think on something that is very important.

44:02.297 --> 44:04.660
Non-books in libraries.

44:04.680 --> 44:05.421
Non-books?

44:05.882 --> 44:06.222
Yes.

44:06.242 --> 44:06.863
Meaning what?

44:08.045 --> 44:14.033
Meaning that libraries are sending back fantastic things to donors.

44:15.177 --> 44:17.119
that this is not in book format.

44:17.259 --> 44:19.381
This is not a book, and we collect books.

44:19.401 --> 44:22.724
Well, what do you mean they're sending back things?

44:23.605 --> 44:31.291
Okay, I gave about 15,000 items to the University of Chicago, Ray Huston Library.

44:32.452 --> 44:35.115
The man with whom I made the deal died.

44:35.795 --> 44:41.180
He dropped dead on a railroad station in England on vacation.

44:41.200 --> 44:44.323
And a new group took over the library.

44:44.911 --> 44:50.758
And they sent back to me about a thousand items from my collection.

44:52.160 --> 44:54.083
Breathtaking things.

44:54.723 --> 44:58.348
Things were the only copy I had in my library.

44:58.829 --> 45:00.511
Because they say that's not a book.

45:01.492 --> 45:05.437
Because it's only fifteen pages, sixteen pages.

45:05.457 --> 45:09.202
Because it has no Library of Congress number.

45:09.502 --> 45:11.745
They sound like pretty stupid people.

45:13.160 --> 45:22.611
more and more computer-oriented stupid people are in the libraries, and you are the only person to whom they would listen.

45:22.631 --> 45:24.674
Well, I'm going to write a whole chapter on that, you know.

45:25.475 --> 45:25.575
Yeah.

45:25.595 --> 45:30.461
When I go out to California for the ILAB next month, are you going out?

45:31.502 --> 45:34.085
You know, the International League of Antiquarium Booksellers?

45:35.427 --> 45:35.587
Exactly.

45:35.607 --> 45:39.792
And then from there, I'm going up to Seattle to Corbis, which is this whole...

45:39.957 --> 45:44.443
unit of Microsoft, which is putting books on CD-ROMs.

45:45.684 --> 45:51.071
And I'm doing the whole exploration of what shape libraries and books are taking in the future.

45:51.111 --> 45:53.514
And I'm doing a major job of it.

45:53.534 --> 46:01.404
I mean, I'm talking to all the important people, including a Nobel laureate at the Rockefeller University.

46:02.085 --> 46:04.388
You know I won the Nobel Prize.

46:05.189 --> 46:05.610
You did?

46:05.630 --> 46:09.154
First, I won it from a Ukrainian.

46:09.539 --> 46:18.532
physician on the ship, you know, and I won his Nobel Prize.

46:18.812 --> 46:19.413
Did you really?

46:19.853 --> 46:24.560
Yeah, but then he won it back.

46:25.842 --> 46:28.405
The second time, I won the Nobel Prize.

46:28.566 --> 46:29.627
You know why?

46:29.647 --> 46:29.727
Why?

46:30.208 --> 46:37.538
Because I wore my chef's pants for one year without a belt.

46:38.294 --> 46:40.657
It was called the no belt.

46:44.641 --> 46:47.724
For fat people who could wear their hair for one year.

46:47.744 --> 46:48.365
That's funny.

46:49.586 --> 46:50.447
That's really cute.

46:51.048 --> 46:53.250
Yeah, but don't write about this.

46:53.271 --> 46:54.372
No, no, no, no, no.

46:54.472 --> 46:56.354
I will give you book stories.

46:56.374 --> 46:59.357
Well, I want stories for the second book on book collecting.

46:59.437 --> 47:03.782
I'm going to do a... I promise you I will send you to Melk.

47:05.104 --> 47:05.544
Okay.

47:06.225 --> 47:08.267
Melk is a monastery.

47:09.344 --> 47:17.217
near to Vienna, a very quiet, unassuming place.

47:17.237 --> 47:18.079
You know?

47:19.601 --> 47:25.311
And you will hear fantastic stories, and you will see mind-blowing books.

47:26.084 --> 47:29.308
Now, what is the significance of this monastic library?

47:29.649 --> 47:32.072
Is there a historical significance to it?

47:33.214 --> 47:35.457
Historic significance?

47:35.477 --> 47:44.089
That this is one of the last medieval monastic libraries in the same hands of the same order.

47:44.109 --> 47:45.171
Oh, I have to go there then.

47:46.072 --> 47:47.093
You will have to go there.

47:47.133 --> 47:53.142
Because I'm going to Patmos in the Aegean, where there's a 900-year-old Greek monastic library.

47:53.162 --> 47:54.083
That's right.

47:54.586 --> 47:56.028
Uninterrupted.

47:56.549 --> 47:58.011
The Turks didn't stop them.

47:58.071 --> 47:58.973
Nobody stopped them.

47:58.993 --> 47:59.714
They're still there.

48:00.054 --> 48:00.916
Yes.

48:00.936 --> 48:03.420
Now this is also such a library.

48:04.301 --> 48:05.703
Melk, M-E-L-K, right?

48:07.105 --> 48:09.389
Melk, M-E-L-K.

48:09.709 --> 48:09.990
Right.

48:10.631 --> 48:10.811
Yeah.

48:11.832 --> 48:12.894
Oh, this is good, Louis.

48:13.355 --> 48:14.456
You're doing your job here.

48:14.957 --> 48:18.803
I will arrange for somebody who will drive you to Melk and Meg.

48:18.823 --> 48:19.264
You will?

48:19.604 --> 48:21.788
Yes.

48:21.808 --> 48:22.028
Sure.

48:23.577 --> 48:25.762
You know, I'm going to call my travel agent.

48:25.782 --> 48:30.152
I'm going to go ahead and see if I can make arrangements now for that Chicago trip.

48:30.713 --> 48:30.914
Yeah.

48:31.996 --> 48:34.923
And I will get you some.

48:34.943 --> 48:37.890
You see, we should not concentrate only on that.

48:38.849 --> 48:40.833
this kind of old things.

48:40.853 --> 48:41.494
Oh, no, no.

48:41.594 --> 48:43.778
We're going to do books of the future, too.

48:43.798 --> 48:44.640
Don't you understand?

48:45.301 --> 48:48.086
I'm going to have two chapters here, both called Continuum.

48:48.166 --> 48:50.590
Continuum 1 is the first chapter.

48:50.650 --> 48:52.854
Continuum 2 is the final chapter.

48:53.536 --> 49:00.088
And then there are going to be about six very exciting chapters in between, one of which will be these emigre booksellers.

49:00.168 --> 49:01.971
Another one is going to be about creative

49:02.558 --> 49:15.553
writers, artists, and their thoughts about, I'm going to do about literary librarians like Gerta, like Borges, men who were great creative artists, but who also were librarians in their lifetime.

49:15.593 --> 49:16.194
Did you know that?

49:16.935 --> 49:28.649
And I will also get you together with a publisher within his 90s who is publishing miniature books.

49:30.571 --> 49:31.292
In the U.S.?

49:31.772 --> 49:32.413
In the U.S.

49:33.136 --> 49:33.977
Hmm.

49:33.997 --> 49:35.499
His name is Stanley Marcus.

49:35.819 --> 49:37.140
Huh?

49:37.161 --> 49:39.343
He has a non-asuch press.

49:39.363 --> 49:40.104
That's his press?

49:41.305 --> 49:41.966
Non-asuch.

49:42.046 --> 49:43.307
Yeah, that's a famous press.

49:43.968 --> 49:45.330
Yes.

49:45.350 --> 49:46.651
That's his press.

49:46.671 --> 49:47.572
Isn't he out of Texas?

49:48.313 --> 49:48.593
Yeah.

49:48.934 --> 49:50.576
Isn't he the Neiman Marcus fellow?

49:51.176 --> 49:52.317
Yeah.

49:52.338 --> 49:53.058
Stanley Marcus.

49:53.078 --> 49:53.859
Yeah.

49:53.879 --> 49:54.860
I'd love to talk to him.

49:55.841 --> 49:58.585
I just had lunch with him a few weeks ago.

49:59.986 --> 50:01.708
And I know him since ages.

50:02.633 --> 50:03.675
Didn't he go to Harvard?

50:05.239 --> 50:06.382
I think he got to Harvard.

50:06.402 --> 50:12.275
Yeah, he was one of George Parker Winship's students at Harvard, one of Winship's students.

50:12.997 --> 50:13.157
Yeah.

50:14.821 --> 50:16.805
Well, this is coming together, will we?

50:17.808 --> 50:18.128
Sure.

50:18.289 --> 50:21.115
Now, should I contact Ralph Newman and this other fellow?

50:21.955 --> 50:25.039
Would you think it would be better for you to do that?

50:25.540 --> 50:35.074
Let me contact the other fellow and let me explore the situation with Ralph Newman.

50:35.715 --> 50:37.597
Ralph Newman has a third wife.

50:38.078 --> 50:38.459
Okay.

50:38.659 --> 50:40.241
Who is a very strange lady.

50:43.546 --> 50:44.567
Very strange lady.

50:45.008 --> 50:48.834
But I'm really interested in his reminiscences and I'll put him in this new book.

50:49.214 --> 50:51.237
That's what I would like to do.

50:51.976 --> 50:56.349
I think it would really be a grave mistake if you missed this opportunity.

50:57.131 --> 51:00.561
Let me handle it my way and then I get back to you.

51:00.621 --> 51:02.326
I have a fellow I'm going to see in L.A.

51:02.948 --> 51:07.200
next month, Lloyd Coatsen, who owns the Neutrogena Company.

51:08.125 --> 51:11.249
And he's a major, major collector of children's books.

51:11.289 --> 51:14.573
He had an opportunity to be in A Gentle Madness, and he turned it down.

51:15.374 --> 51:21.801
And he came up to me at the LA Fair, and he said, all my friends cannot believe I could have been in this book, and I refused.

51:21.821 --> 51:27.068
He said, I'll do anything to get it to the next one.

51:27.128 --> 51:31.733
And he's turning all of his books over, children's books, to Princeton.

51:31.974 --> 51:35.618
And he also wants to set up something where children can be involved.

51:36.070 --> 51:39.376
Not students, you know, like college students, but young children.

51:40.478 --> 51:45.306
And this is a tribute to his young son who was murdered about 15 years ago.

51:45.326 --> 51:46.228
It's a great story.

51:47.190 --> 51:49.053
So I'm going to have that in the next book.

51:49.073 --> 51:51.858
And then that'll also be a chapter on literacy, you see.

51:51.878 --> 51:53.000
So I'm going to do literacy.

51:53.541 --> 51:54.923
I'm going to do dumbing down.

51:54.983 --> 51:56.526
I'm going to do this whole thing about

51:56.962 --> 52:21.940
uh this this thing about canonization how books enter the literary canon and when you go to Sarajevo we will try to get you to make a side trip to a very different type of a library who was a man was a literary figure in Transylvania and
