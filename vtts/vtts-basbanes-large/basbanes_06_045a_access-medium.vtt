WEBVTT

00:03.187 --> 00:04.268
Let me start talking.

00:04.589 --> 00:05.990
This is Nick.

00:06.611 --> 00:13.398
We're in the book room of Erwin T. Holtzman in Post Point Farms.

00:13.418 --> 00:14.239
Is that where we are?

00:14.439 --> 00:14.860
Michigan.

00:15.620 --> 00:16.181
Let's test this.

00:17.122 --> 00:19.264
It's 3 August 1991.

00:19.284 --> 00:20.065
Okay, Toby.

00:21.146 --> 00:21.967
Give me a little tour.

00:21.987 --> 00:23.569
How come there's only one chair in here?

00:24.190 --> 00:32.839
Because I consider it a book room, and the only person that's going to work in this room is me.

00:33.308 --> 00:41.318
I'm not interested in a chair to read or to have people come and sit and talk or read.

00:41.919 --> 00:45.043
It's a workroom.

00:45.063 --> 00:56.798
Why is it that outsiders, so to speak, even members of your family, it seems, why is it that you don't want to educate in this room or even convert?

00:56.818 --> 00:59.702
Because we have another room, which we call the home library.

00:59.722 --> 00:59.822
Okay.

01:00.494 --> 01:01.756
which you showed me earlier.

01:01.776 --> 01:04.640
And quite symbolically, you're the only person who can sit in that chair.

01:04.660 --> 01:05.321
Is that correct?

01:06.803 --> 01:09.607
Once in a while, if you want to, I'll let you know.

01:09.627 --> 01:10.227
Oh, that's okay.

01:10.247 --> 01:12.030
Imagine that you're the proprietor.

01:12.090 --> 01:12.450
Okay.

01:12.671 --> 01:14.313
But then you have all of the troubles.

01:15.074 --> 01:18.459
But there's something symbolic about that, isn't there?

01:19.480 --> 01:21.924
I prefer to think of it as a genuine work room.

01:22.024 --> 01:24.187
I try to work here.

01:24.207 --> 01:28.813
I set my exhibits up here, and I relate...

01:29.502 --> 01:31.425
to my collections here.

01:32.186 --> 01:38.436
The other room that I showed you over the garage, I relate to library work and placement of collections.

01:38.456 --> 01:46.588
But this one is actually where I work with the books as they come and try to shelve them before I run out of faith.

01:48.190 --> 01:49.973
And what essentially do we have in this room?

01:50.774 --> 01:58.446
The first thing we have is a combination of bookcases, files, and exhibits.

01:59.472 --> 02:04.518
And I did not make it the old-fashioned way with the lock cases.

02:05.099 --> 02:12.007
It's a simple system of glass that slides.

02:12.407 --> 02:23.761
The idea of book exhibits is always a continual challenge for me anyway, because as I've told you before, I'm interested in getting more people into libraries and having more interesting exhibits.

02:23.781 --> 02:29.007
So I play with the idea of having more colorful and multimedia-type exhibits.

02:29.240 --> 02:36.050
Right now it's set up for the great Soviet writer Isaac Babel, who was killed by Stalin in 1940.

02:37.071 --> 02:55.197
Because of my connections in the Soviet Union, I have things like the new edition of the collected memoirs of people who knew Babel, put out by the editor, his widow, and it's an inscription from the widow to me, and she's awaiting me in Moscow in September.

02:55.632 --> 03:00.584
You said before we went on tape that this is the finest Babel collection anyone is likely to see.

03:00.625 --> 03:10.269
What I really said was, as far as Nick Bassbanks is concerned, I don't think you're going to see because of your other activity.

03:10.289 --> 03:11.953
I don't think you'll see another one.

03:12.457 --> 03:13.899
Like this was my comment.

03:13.959 --> 03:30.158
Okay, what distinguishes the collection of Babel from others that I'm... Number one, well, number one, I seem to be the only individual working on Babel in the West that is not either an academic or a member of the family.

03:30.178 --> 03:37.046
Number two, the institutions have sort of given up trying to collect Babel because it's getting very, very difficult.

03:37.066 --> 03:38.548
What I'm looking at in this room

03:39.743 --> 03:42.950
Is this what ultimately will be going to Jerusalem?

03:42.970 --> 03:54.816
What you're seeing from here, what's going to be the beginning of the archives of Israeli...

03:55.420 --> 03:57.863
writers in Jerusalem.

03:58.003 --> 03:59.525
There's about 2,500 books there.

03:59.625 --> 04:06.154
Okay, one, two, three, four, you showed me five bookcases of tin air glitter, tin shells, one, two, three, four.

04:06.214 --> 04:07.315
You're talking about actually 2,500.

04:07.515 --> 04:08.036
Okay.

04:08.056 --> 04:11.941
Because the books are insanely small at the beginning of the early period.

04:12.482 --> 04:19.110
Very few of them, with the exception of the translated works in English, start getting bigger.

04:20.351 --> 04:21.613
So you're talking about

04:21.779 --> 04:24.943
It used to be 10 to the foot.

04:26.325 --> 04:28.548
With the Israeli, it tends to be 15 to the foot.

04:28.788 --> 04:40.163
Tell me, when did you begin forming this collection, and when, and also as a corollary to that question, when did you devise the idea of presenting such a collection to the state of Israel?

04:41.524 --> 04:51.297
Pointing into that, I can tell you that this is divided into Arabic, and then translations from, this is Yiddish,

04:51.935 --> 04:53.477
and then translations from.

04:54.859 --> 05:03.249
And now we break it down into anthologies, and then we start with the individual authors on this shelf here.

05:04.330 --> 05:06.353
And, of course, there's some confusion.

05:06.413 --> 05:11.038
Sometimes there's an author, two authors of the same book, and I might get two copies, etc.

05:11.419 --> 05:14.483
Let me just follow up on something at this point.

05:15.404 --> 05:20.490
The thrust here, when we talk about collecting, so many people think about rearing

05:21.128 --> 05:27.436
We are not looking at books that by themselves individually are necessarily rare.

05:27.816 --> 05:28.497
Is that correct?

05:29.278 --> 05:38.729
But what we're looking at is a possibly unique collection that is more valuable as an entity than it is by individual items.

05:38.749 --> 05:46.258
I think I've told you a couple times that the definition of a collector, of a collection, is that the collection is

05:47.538 --> 05:49.180
More than the sum of the parts.

05:49.201 --> 05:50.543
The word for that is synergistic.

05:50.783 --> 05:51.043
Good.

05:51.404 --> 05:52.806
That's Bucky Fuller that I showed you.

05:52.826 --> 05:53.146
Yeah.

05:53.607 --> 05:53.847
All right.

05:54.108 --> 05:55.009
Back to the question.

05:55.089 --> 05:58.394
So you would say a true collection is synergistic, is that correct?

05:58.474 --> 05:59.196
Did you use that word?

05:59.376 --> 06:02.561
No, Bucky would use that word.

06:02.581 --> 06:03.222
Not me.

06:03.242 --> 06:03.402
Okay.

06:03.903 --> 06:04.544
That's his word.

06:05.425 --> 06:06.126
You're a lovely word.

06:06.246 --> 06:07.668
Greater than the sum of its parts.

06:08.089 --> 06:08.329
All right.

06:08.710 --> 06:09.952
Let's get into rarity.

06:09.972 --> 06:10.332
Okay.

06:12.055 --> 06:15.059
It was on a scale from one to a hundred.

06:15.079 --> 06:16.802
Some of these are insanely...

06:17.609 --> 06:43.465
prayer some of these are taken at my request from authors from their own parents because they themselves don't even have a copy from an example you have asked the author you have approached the author is that right some of them instantly where to go to find this item and please tell me what this book is

06:44.204 --> 06:58.827
This is M. Guri, who was just quoted as a poet and a fiction writer.

07:00.329 --> 07:07.381
He was just quoted, I believe, last month in one of the articles in the New York Times about the current events in Israel.

07:08.683 --> 07:11.427
This is his first book, Flames of Fire.

07:12.773 --> 07:15.477
So we're talking about a year after.

07:15.537 --> 07:17.841
We're talking about less than a year, probably.

07:17.861 --> 07:20.746
We're talking about the absolute infancy of the state, right?

07:20.766 --> 07:26.094
We're talking about the very first classic works of Israeli literature.

07:26.234 --> 07:28.458
Would this be their Gutenberg Bible, so to speak?

07:28.838 --> 07:34.427
No, because their books have received it.

07:34.795 --> 07:39.341
So there is a Libia Larissimus that even precedes this, is that correct?

07:39.401 --> 07:51.278
Well, I've been trying to establish the first book published in the State of Israel, because after that, before that, they said Land of Israel, or Eretz Palestine.

07:52.459 --> 07:55.744
After May 15, 1948, they said State of Israel.

07:57.626 --> 07:59.389
And what does this say on a copyright page?

08:00.490 --> 08:01.832
Does this say where it was published?

08:02.740 --> 08:10.631
Well, this is 1949, so I'm embarrassed to tell you that it doesn't say State of Israel, and it doesn't say not State of Israel in English.

08:10.651 --> 08:13.454
It may say it in Hebrew.

08:13.474 --> 08:20.303
But I know this for a fact, that you can establish either by date or by statement, whether it's pre-state or state.

08:20.323 --> 08:25.751
And I am trying to start with the state, and some of the writers and books overlap.

08:26.231 --> 08:30.537
This is inscribed, you'll have to believe me, in Hebrew to his parents.

08:31.799 --> 08:37.249
So that is really the most important association.

08:37.449 --> 08:41.857
I doubt if he went and did another one because he can't find one of these himself now.

08:42.979 --> 08:44.101
But in any case.

08:44.182 --> 08:47.147
To do it again and find it again.

08:47.307 --> 08:52.978
The reason that I was successful in doing this is that this is a transitory proposition.

08:52.998 --> 08:54.280
That this is in transit.

08:54.935 --> 08:58.400
to the archives of Israeli literature in Jerusalem.

08:58.440 --> 08:59.081
You understand?

08:59.121 --> 09:00.463
He will see this book.

09:00.483 --> 09:02.506
He understood that you are a gatherer.

09:02.666 --> 09:04.048
Absolutely.

09:04.068 --> 09:04.689
I'm not a hunter.

09:05.751 --> 09:08.595
That's important, isn't it?

09:08.615 --> 09:11.038
Everybody is either a gatherer or a hunter in the early days.

09:12.220 --> 09:15.505
Then they became a plumber.

09:17.287 --> 09:18.309
You are a hunter, though.

09:19.410 --> 09:20.211
But I'm a gatherer.

09:22.555 --> 09:22.815
All right.

09:25.141 --> 09:27.343
It's not one on the scale of one to a hundred.

09:27.784 --> 09:30.127
It's getting there.

09:30.167 --> 09:32.009
Well, let's sign a number.

09:32.229 --> 09:33.531
Now, let's go to a hundred.

09:34.692 --> 09:34.972
I can't.

09:35.493 --> 09:36.394
Let's go to a hundred.

09:36.614 --> 09:39.157
A hundred would be... A hundred being the highest or the lowest?

09:40.919 --> 09:43.542
A hundred would be a reprint in paper of a new novel.

09:43.662 --> 09:45.524
Let's not even waste our time with a hundred.

09:45.544 --> 09:51.871
What I'm talking about is that here's David Grossman's Sea Under Love, an absolutely brilliant novel that came out two years ago.

09:51.991 --> 09:52.532
Which I have.

09:52.552 --> 09:53.393
And I have...

09:53.862 --> 09:55.064
the proof copy.

09:55.084 --> 09:55.784
I have the American.

09:55.805 --> 09:56.485
I have the English.

09:56.966 --> 09:57.907
I have this reprint.

09:57.967 --> 09:59.129
I have this reprint.

09:59.149 --> 10:00.791
So this is close.

10:00.811 --> 10:01.952
This is after 50.

10:02.493 --> 10:07.119
The original works in the original language are 1 to 50.

10:07.299 --> 10:11.645
And then I would say that the translations are 50 to 100 on a scale of 1 to 100.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.708
One being the most rarest, right?

10:14.308 --> 10:14.408
Yeah.

10:14.428 --> 10:23.380
Well, I would say... Well, the problem is that the shelves that we're looking at now and talking about don't include the...

10:23.613 --> 10:29.319
the corrected typescript is submitted to the publisher that I showed you upstairs.

10:29.379 --> 10:30.320
They're in the vault.

10:30.481 --> 10:31.762
Yeah, well, that's not a one even.

10:32.203 --> 10:34.625
His original Holocaust notes would be one.

10:34.705 --> 10:35.266
Holographs.

10:35.566 --> 10:36.407
Holographs.

10:36.427 --> 10:37.128
So you understand?

10:37.328 --> 10:44.156
But what I'm telling you, in printed matter, there always is a precedent, and you know what that is.

10:44.176 --> 10:45.117
What's fun is this.

10:46.238 --> 10:47.800
And I will even do this.

10:48.260 --> 10:48.441
Here.

10:49.462 --> 10:50.503
Saturday Review Press.

10:51.344 --> 10:52.405
Took it from McCall.

10:52.958 --> 10:59.686
So you went up to the fellow, you knew him, or you introduced yourself to him?

10:59.706 --> 11:06.815
In his apartment, I asked him for, number one, a checklist of his work in Hebrew and a checklist of his work in English.

11:06.855 --> 11:07.576
Does he have one?

11:08.957 --> 11:11.020
His wife had the beginnings of one.

11:11.841 --> 11:12.882
Some of the writers don't.

11:13.022 --> 11:14.564
Some of them, they don't even know what they're.

11:15.025 --> 11:16.426
You understand how this works?

11:16.486 --> 11:19.590
Then I got into the fact that I'd like to have signed copies of all his books.

11:20.228 --> 11:21.990
He didn't know where he was going to give them to me.

11:22.170 --> 11:23.232
He'd love to give me the books.

11:23.272 --> 11:24.053
He doesn't have them.

11:24.754 --> 11:26.997
And I said, what's your first book, Flames of Fire?

11:27.137 --> 11:28.158
And I said, do you have one?

11:28.198 --> 11:30.381
He says, no, but I'll get you one from my parents.

11:30.481 --> 11:33.605
And I said, that's lovely.

11:33.625 --> 11:35.888
And this type of story has replicated itself.

11:36.108 --> 11:37.370
Yeah, this is Yehud Amakai.

11:37.570 --> 11:39.072
The first book is privately printed.

11:39.393 --> 11:43.338
His wife has his copy from the first divorce.

11:44.299 --> 11:46.241
And this is a copy of his second book.

11:46.261 --> 11:48.244
I don't have a copy of his first book yet.

11:49.422 --> 11:50.123
But here we go.

11:50.884 --> 11:56.269
This is the second binding of the second book.

11:56.289 --> 11:57.470
It's not the first binding.

11:57.691 --> 11:58.431
So here we go.

11:58.752 --> 12:04.518
And it's much harder for me as a collector of American literature reading English to collect books in Hebrew.

12:04.798 --> 12:06.039
Much, much harder.

12:06.179 --> 12:07.060
It's very hard.

12:07.180 --> 12:08.422
So what's his name again?

12:08.662 --> 12:09.883
His name is Yehuda Amichai.

12:09.903 --> 12:11.164
He's the leading poet.

12:12.185 --> 12:12.766
Yehuda.

12:13.367 --> 12:17.671
Y-E-H-U-D-A-A-M-I-H-A-I.

12:17.871 --> 12:18.552
C-H-A-I.

12:19.038 --> 12:20.199
Yehuda Anakai.

12:20.419 --> 12:21.861
It's not done properly.

12:22.081 --> 12:23.062
We don't get the last name.

12:23.723 --> 12:27.066
Let's get that.

12:27.086 --> 12:28.888
That was the book we were looking at up today.

12:28.908 --> 12:33.392
Yehuda, A-M-I-C-H-A-I.

12:33.933 --> 12:41.100
He is considered one of the leading poets in the world, as well as the leading poet in the state of history.

12:41.220 --> 12:43.683
It's not of this time, not of this place.

12:43.743 --> 12:46.766
I understand, but that's a subsidiary.

12:48.528 --> 12:48.808
Yeah.

12:49.345 --> 12:50.286
All right.

12:50.306 --> 13:00.199
Getting closer to 100 on the scale, we have periodicals of which his material appears.

13:00.960 --> 13:06.347
And sometimes, as you know, you can reflect to yourself that it may be the only appearance.

13:06.748 --> 13:07.389
And here we are.

13:07.869 --> 13:11.414
Here's an Isaac Babel that I don't even remember being in here.

13:11.534 --> 13:13.837
And I'm working on Babel, and I'm standing with you.

13:14.197 --> 13:15.019
You see how this works?

13:15.039 --> 13:17.682
I'd place that higher than 100, frankly, wouldn't you?

13:18.151 --> 13:21.676
No, 100 is the top, or the bottom.

13:21.716 --> 13:23.218
That's what I'm saying.

13:23.298 --> 13:29.928
I would make it higher up the scale, closer to the... I would put it at the bottom.

13:32.030 --> 13:33.192
Why are you leaving it out?

13:33.212 --> 13:34.554
Because I want to work on it with Babel.

13:35.195 --> 13:36.677
You've forgotten about that, in other words.

13:37.678 --> 13:38.840
I didn't know it was in there.

13:38.860 --> 13:42.265
Okay, here's a writer called John Canio.

13:42.385 --> 13:45.289
He's a major writer, and he's done a lot of things with Athenaeum.

13:45.725 --> 13:49.849
I just found this, and I didn't get a chance to discuss it with him.

13:50.510 --> 14:01.922
But believe it or not, this is a book not about him, but it's illustrated by him, because he was a painter at one time in his career.

14:03.283 --> 14:03.804
Here we go.

14:03.984 --> 14:08.008
The more you do not look at books in your collection, it's at your paragraph.

14:08.429 --> 14:12.593
And the more every time you open a book, you will find something.

14:13.889 --> 14:15.972
Tell me when we're having breakfast this morning.

14:15.992 --> 14:19.356
You come home and you stare at your books.

14:19.877 --> 14:27.607
Physically, I will take maybe that and remember that I have four variant bindings of this.

14:29.469 --> 14:30.070
I'm looking at it.

14:31.031 --> 14:33.234
I have three variant bindings of this.

14:33.254 --> 14:33.955
These are colored.

14:34.256 --> 14:36.378
You have to remind yourself what you have.

14:36.939 --> 14:42.446
I also, once in a while, have to remind myself that I don't need the English that I'm resurrected.

14:42.506 --> 14:43.828
I have it.

14:45.040 --> 14:46.282
Got him resurrected.

14:48.524 --> 14:48.825
Right.

14:49.986 --> 14:51.908
The American proofs of C under love.

14:53.490 --> 14:58.036
How am I going to remember that if I'm not reacquainted with it once more?

14:58.116 --> 14:59.377
That's C-S-E-E.

15:01.540 --> 15:03.262
Born, love.

15:03.322 --> 15:12.033
The last time David was in that area, I picked him up at the airport and showed him around.

15:13.074 --> 15:14.676
Such a, such a, such a claim.

15:17.896 --> 15:20.779
the books.

15:20.859 --> 15:27.385
And now, several years ago, I decided it was foolish for me, as the conductor, to have them signed to me.

15:28.567 --> 15:29.868
So I'm having them signed.

15:29.948 --> 15:30.709
OK, I'll just see.

15:30.789 --> 15:39.858
David Grossman has inscribed in this book, facing the title page, for the Israel National Library collection, David Grossman.

15:39.938 --> 15:47.025
Note that copy lacks the Hebrew letters in the last part.

15:47.461 --> 15:48.522
the encyclopedia.

15:49.123 --> 15:58.173
He's calling attention to the proofs, uncorrected proofs, lack some material that then comes out in the book.

15:58.413 --> 16:01.877
Okay, so that's really wonderful then.

16:01.897 --> 16:02.577
I mean, that's nice.

16:02.617 --> 16:03.598
Of course.

16:03.859 --> 16:07.503
As a collector, how does that fit you in Kiblet's or something like that?

16:07.763 --> 16:08.604
It's between the eyes.

16:08.624 --> 16:09.505
You like it?

16:10.646 --> 16:17.113
Well, the reason I admire it is because a lot of the writers, as you know, have a love-hate relationship with their published work.

16:17.178 --> 16:29.331
A lot of the writers have an understanding, and I've tried to explain that to the Israelis and Russians, that they shouldn't, after the birth, they shouldn't step away.

16:29.351 --> 16:37.841
They should be part of the whole process, get into the bookstores, get with the collectors, get with the... He's a young guy, and he appreciates.

16:38.461 --> 16:44.468
David Grossman is the first of the younger bunch of writers that had enough brains

16:46.355 --> 16:51.742
career-wide, to try to contact me before we even met.

16:52.123 --> 17:00.173
He inscribed a book of his to me, and it was handed to me at the bookseller that I buy my new books from in Tel Aviv one year.

17:00.193 --> 17:01.495
I said, who the hell is David Grossman?

17:03.538 --> 17:06.121
But he made contact with me before I made contact with him.

17:06.181 --> 17:06.502
Think of it.

17:07.223 --> 17:08.464
And he's very successful, as you know.

17:08.524 --> 17:12.610
He did publicity, and he's a wonderful guy.

17:12.630 --> 17:14.252
His book, A Yellow Wind,

17:14.671 --> 17:19.397
was about the Palestinians.

17:19.618 --> 17:24.684
You understand that you're looking at a guy who has the original material.

17:24.704 --> 17:35.118
Have you gotten any... My technique is that they sign for the... The convention, the custom.

17:35.278 --> 17:36.580
It's in Hebrew, they sign in Hebrew.

17:36.600 --> 17:41.787
It's in Hebrew, also at the proper place in the book, which is the back of the book, for Hebrew.

17:42.207 --> 17:43.429
By the way, I hate it.

17:44.135 --> 17:50.001
when they sign on the title page, even though it makes a nice exhibit item, I really believe it violates the book.

17:50.161 --> 18:00.832
And I like to, in the first blank, my thinking is, and this is what I try to do, is to get them always to sign at the first possible blank.

18:00.852 --> 18:01.733
Have you always done this?

18:01.893 --> 18:08.040
They naturally go to the, they gravitate to the title page.

18:10.002 --> 18:12.184
But I feel that that's not right, that somehow

18:12.637 --> 18:21.130
Somehow the authentic first edition of this book should be as it appeared in the store and not augmented.

18:21.450 --> 18:24.375
I think the augmentation could be here even.

18:24.415 --> 18:26.558
But even then, I prefer it on the first one.

18:27.900 --> 18:32.207
It's more respect for the book as opposed to what I think should be done.

18:32.587 --> 18:40.399
So you still didn't answer the question when this idea developed that you would make a presentation to Israel.

18:42.100 --> 19:01.326
Along the way, this is a file for promotional purposes and marketing of Xerox material in English that the Institute for the Translation of Hebrew Literature, whose job it is, puts out in Tel Aviv.

19:02.067 --> 19:04.530
And because of my interest in Israeli literature,

19:05.354 --> 19:08.478
I get materials that may or may not ever be published.

19:09.580 --> 19:13.946
And then this material again and again and again goes to some central place.

19:15.909 --> 19:16.991
And that is the point.

19:17.451 --> 19:18.353
Where should that be?

19:18.973 --> 19:22.879
My home is obviously not proper to be the place.

19:24.581 --> 19:25.142
In Israel.

19:25.342 --> 19:25.963
Now let me just read.

19:25.983 --> 19:27.846
This is literature of Israel.

19:28.367 --> 19:29.829
And that's in a folder.

19:30.330 --> 19:33.454
But I have reams of this material, Xerox material.

19:34.345 --> 19:39.235
some of which comes out, you know, printed in published books, and some doesn't.

19:39.255 --> 19:45.447
You know, the writers are lucky if they are accepted, and the ones who aren't exist like this.

19:46.189 --> 19:48.474
To me, this is the same thing, you understand?

19:48.554 --> 19:49.275
It's printed matter.

19:50.578 --> 19:52.662
Well, it's not published matter, though.

19:52.682 --> 19:54.666
There's a difference between, yeah, print matter.

19:55.523 --> 19:57.525
It's written matter, I wouldn't necessarily say.

19:57.565 --> 20:02.549
I'm a collector of printed matter, but I do go to the holographs and here we go again.

20:02.670 --> 20:04.531
Basically, I'm a collector of printed matter.

20:05.152 --> 20:08.415
I don't care if it's published.

20:08.435 --> 20:11.298
I love it better when it's not published.

20:11.318 --> 20:19.445
Because it means it's even better and scarcer and indicative of some kind of a conclusion that somebody made economically that it wasn't worth publishing.

20:19.465 --> 20:20.586
That doesn't mean it was.

20:20.966 --> 20:22.628
Editorially, perhaps, too.

20:23.300 --> 20:48.151
But you understand now that in my Israeli collection, the idea that I can get some of this material ahead of them, even though it's Xerox, means that I can talk about material and authors ahead of publication, and I consider this part of my challenge.

20:48.171 --> 20:51.535
In other words, I'm pre-dating and then I'm post-dating.

20:53.742 --> 20:55.966
Together, the Soviet stuff starts over here.

20:56.827 --> 20:58.069
We're not through with the Israelis.

20:58.089 --> 20:58.910
About one to a hundred.

21:00.793 --> 21:08.906
This is an excellent writer by the name of Vir Resulteer, who comes together with an artist.

21:11.190 --> 21:11.670
He's 25.

21:11.750 --> 21:15.917
See, this is the same as this.

21:15.937 --> 21:18.922
I'm not really a collector of illustrated material.

21:19.162 --> 21:20.965
I have trouble with art and printed matter.

21:21.518 --> 21:24.962
But I do respect the idea that every once in a while something comes out sort of neat.

21:25.883 --> 21:30.809
And I'm able to get copy 10 at 25.

21:33.111 --> 21:37.176
There's very little published in English, although he's a major.

21:38.998 --> 21:45.645
What I really like about this is the idea that it's dual-english.

21:46.146 --> 21:50.631
And what I do is I include this item in my checklist.

21:51.472 --> 21:52.113
It's in English.

21:52.974 --> 21:56.697
He has no other book that I can put in the checklist.

21:56.717 --> 21:57.178
What is that?

21:58.639 --> 22:05.426
He's not, he's been in anthologies, but he doesn't have a separate book of his own.

22:05.446 --> 22:07.368
Tell me why some poets are published in someone else.

22:09.130 --> 22:15.356
He presents his appearance in my checklist, which presents him to the world and comes from the one of 25, whatever that means.

22:16.838 --> 22:20.922
And I consider this in the way my mind works, in the way the operation works.

22:27.550 --> 22:40.025
Now, not too many collections, not too much oral stuff, although as you know, there's more and more books, you know, listening.

22:40.045 --> 22:46.693
But I have some record material, you know, poets reading, et cetera, et cetera.

22:46.914 --> 22:52.040
And then I also have some adaptations and some film material.

22:52.060 --> 22:53.001
I also have some pictures.

22:54.280 --> 22:57.584
Besides the books themselves, I have ancillary material.

22:58.165 --> 22:59.947
You saw my Faulkner collection.

22:59.967 --> 23:02.451
It's the same thing in the Israelis.

23:02.471 --> 23:05.935
And I also have clipping and criticism.

23:05.955 --> 23:12.003
And I also have complete runs of literary magazines up in the attic.

23:13.405 --> 23:20.555
Those are Hebrew, in Hebrew, complete runs of now out-of-business literary journals.

23:20.575 --> 23:23.899
The librarians in the National Library have told me for 20 years now

23:24.875 --> 23:26.797
that they don't need that because they already have it.

23:27.458 --> 23:31.303
And I keep telling them, I want it all together in one room.

23:31.323 --> 23:33.245
And I don't want running from one place to the other.

23:33.265 --> 23:34.527
And this is a separate thing.

23:34.968 --> 23:37.330
It's like the Faulkner's that I have.

23:37.350 --> 23:39.834
The University of Michigan has a lot of those Faulkner's.

23:39.854 --> 23:45.180
But that doesn't mean that I'm interested in them and they just need it together.

23:47.103 --> 23:51.067
We don't have to go through all 2,500 titles either, by the way.

23:51.088 --> 23:53.110
Well, what's interesting is the Arabic.

23:54.102 --> 23:57.748
I used to buy it for 40 cents, and I've lost my contacts.

23:58.769 --> 24:09.386
And it turns out that a lot of these poetry, little, tiny, little staple poetry collections, is now considered PLO material.

24:11.249 --> 24:14.895
And we'll talk about politics of literature and literature politics.

24:14.915 --> 24:20.143
I think you'll find that an awful lot of my Arab material is very, very...

24:20.292 --> 24:24.897
very interesting to political studies, even though it's literature.

24:25.097 --> 24:31.144
Why do you admit it to the Israeli collection if it's Arabic and Palestinian?

24:31.164 --> 24:43.116
Because the so-called Palestinians were under military occupation at this time for an indefinite period.

24:43.277 --> 24:46.840
Why do you say so-called Palestinians?

24:46.860 --> 24:50.164
Palestine was changed.

24:51.055 --> 24:55.721
into two states.

24:57.103 --> 24:59.606
The Arabic state was still born by their neighbors.

25:00.247 --> 25:01.189
They did not respect it.

25:01.209 --> 25:04.853
They now want what they were offered in 1947 and refused.

25:04.873 --> 25:05.494
It's a little late.

25:07.457 --> 25:09.159
It's not a little late.

25:09.339 --> 25:09.940
It's too late.

25:12.303 --> 25:17.991
It's my belief that the people who consider themselves Palestinians

25:19.540 --> 25:21.142
fighting an Israeli state.

25:23.285 --> 25:29.353
This military occupation is very abhorrent to me because all wars should result in pieces, and I don't understand it.

25:29.373 --> 25:34.800
Therefore, this stuff was produced by these people in that territory, whatever the name of it is.

25:34.821 --> 25:39.967
We're talking about Bethlehem, Nazareth, but a lot of it comes out of Haifa.

25:41.890 --> 25:42.691
So you have it both ways.

25:43.012 --> 25:47.117
And the key element is post-1948.

25:47.485 --> 25:55.172
The key element that was produced by people who lived in that place and was published in that place.

25:55.272 --> 25:56.473
Post-1948.

25:57.494 --> 25:59.236
Which is Israel's place, right?

26:00.017 --> 26:01.078
I understand that now.

26:01.098 --> 26:02.459
Good.

26:02.479 --> 26:17.273
The renewal now is the people who didn't live there, coming from Moscow and Kiev, some of them are now, are they Soviet or are they Israeli?

26:17.843 --> 26:24.230
So I'm actually between my own designations and my classifications and my collections, nothing like that one.

26:24.391 --> 26:26.173
Okay.

26:26.193 --> 26:34.522
Tell me now when, I want a basic question, when did you come?

26:34.763 --> 26:39.548
1973, after the death of my parents, who went to Israel quite a bit.

26:41.536 --> 26:44.159
but they wanted to.

26:44.319 --> 26:49.564
I attended the Jerusalem Book Fair in 73, after every year since.

26:49.584 --> 26:51.786
In 73, I began to go into bookstores.

26:51.806 --> 26:57.091
They have a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful confusion in quantity and quality of bookstores.

26:57.111 --> 26:57.331
New.

26:58.553 --> 27:00.114
To use books is a different problem.

27:01.395 --> 27:04.238
They don't have the concept of modern first edition.

27:05.439 --> 27:08.382
I've been telling them about it.

27:08.402 --> 27:09.383
I like people who collect

27:09.582 --> 27:11.985
Modern First Editions, but they don't even make the standards.

27:13.107 --> 27:19.055
They also don't have the shops of antiquarian Modern First Editions.

27:19.556 --> 27:22.340
So you really have to work.

27:22.360 --> 27:25.465
It's not London or New York.

27:25.485 --> 27:33.556
If you go into a new bookstore, the First Editions sell out very, very fast of the good books because the opinions are very small.

27:33.897 --> 27:35.339
The publishers are very conservative.

27:35.399 --> 27:35.979
I'm a size.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.184
40,000 is nothing over there, and they still go.

27:40.143 --> 27:42.745
four times ten.

27:42.765 --> 27:44.367
You have to be on top of the situation.

27:45.067 --> 27:49.852
Again, getting the antiquarian and going back to 48, 49, 50.

27:50.312 --> 27:54.876
I have a couple of dealers who want some dealers to pay for the price.

27:54.896 --> 27:56.158
You're straight from the question, though.

27:57.619 --> 28:01.382
With your parents, you were over there in 73 for the first time.

28:01.402 --> 28:07.568
Oh, I began to realize in 73 because seeing all the bookstores and also seeing how hard it was to get the antiquarian.

28:08.830 --> 28:21.906
I still reminded myself that going back to 48 is possible, and that I basically, as a book collector, even though I don't read Hebrew, I basically can go and become a great collector.

28:23.988 --> 28:25.229
And I started right then.

28:26.131 --> 28:32.378
And I saw a couple writers, and I started buying the new printings.

28:32.398 --> 28:33.419
Okay, key question.

28:33.439 --> 28:34.380
This was in 73?

28:34.400 --> 28:34.561
73.

28:35.301 --> 28:36.643
You were collecting what at that time?

28:37.467 --> 28:44.233
At that time, I was working on my Faulkner, and I was working on what I call Russian literature and English.

28:44.434 --> 28:47.537
At that time, I wasn't as tough on Soviet.

28:47.637 --> 28:49.258
What about your 300 American authors?

28:49.438 --> 28:54.243
I also was working on 300 American authors all the way from Mailer to Scott Fitzgerald.

28:54.643 --> 29:04.673
And as wonderful a collection as that sounds, and I do want to go back and talk about that at some point, you probably realize that you could not be a great collector

29:04.990 --> 29:07.314
by those books or those authors alone.

29:07.474 --> 29:08.355
Is that probably true?

29:10.198 --> 29:11.059
What you said... No.

29:11.220 --> 29:16.928
To use your phrase, you saw the opportunity to be a great collector.

29:16.968 --> 29:20.794
What it really meant, to extend the borders past the United States, my country.

29:21.415 --> 29:32.432
However... In other words, I would say a great international collector as opposed to... I think what I'm driving at is maybe he saw the opportunity to achieve a different level.

29:32.783 --> 29:39.669
as a collector that you really couldn't do with the 300-odd offers that you were doing that you were collecting back here.

29:39.830 --> 29:46.155
I was a little disillusioned with the quality of American literature at that time and what was happening, and also the sign limits and all that procedure.

29:46.176 --> 29:48.798
However, but nevertheless, I was looking for something else.

29:49.198 --> 29:50.319
Well, you said it in the front of it.

29:50.339 --> 29:55.244
Were you striving for a— Wait, did you— Well, I jumped across the Atlantic.

29:55.264 --> 29:56.785
I jumped across the Atlantic.

29:57.566 --> 30:01.710
Did you see this as an opportunity to achieve greatness as a collector, I guess?

30:02.230 --> 30:08.058
That's why I'm waiting to sit down the right place.

30:08.078 --> 30:08.778
Pretty hard.

30:11.061 --> 30:12.023
Here we go again.

30:12.824 --> 30:16.528
Brandeis, Harvard, et cetera, et cetera.

30:17.930 --> 30:18.331
They're librarians.

30:18.351 --> 30:23.798
We're working on this, but not to the extent that they shouldn't have done it.

30:23.818 --> 30:26.681
And I saw an opportunity to be, like, jump ahead.

30:27.122 --> 30:31.748
Was this also about the time where you decided to divest yourself of your American books?

30:32.268 --> 30:37.877
Okay, so you started, however, at that point.

30:38.137 --> 30:42.724
You started acquiring, gathering, building.

30:42.744 --> 30:45.448
Building is perhaps the right word.

30:45.468 --> 30:49.154
Building this collection.

30:49.174 --> 30:50.336
Are you obsessed with it?

30:50.356 --> 30:56.926
Yeah, especially when I found that this is probably the first book of serious literature published in the New States.

30:57.106 --> 30:58.188
And you're now holding what?

30:58.869 --> 31:00.351
I'm holding Nathan Shaham.

31:00.668 --> 31:01.389
Natham.

31:01.709 --> 31:02.269
Natham.

31:02.690 --> 31:05.552
N-A-T-H-A-N.

31:06.393 --> 31:06.834
Shaham.

31:07.474 --> 31:10.117
S-H-A-H-A-M.

31:10.437 --> 31:12.379
S-H-A-H-A-M.

31:13.680 --> 31:16.623
First book, short stories.

31:16.783 --> 31:17.924
Which you're holding right now.

31:17.984 --> 31:22.788
Which he thinks was done in the spring of 1948.

31:23.329 --> 31:24.750
There it is, 1948.

31:25.090 --> 31:26.392
And it says State of Israel.

31:26.672 --> 31:28.954
And it says State of Israel on a copyright page.

31:29.508 --> 31:31.831
The crucial date is May 15th.

31:33.554 --> 31:43.527
I have not been able to or get anybody to cooperate with me in trying to see what books came out in that week.

31:44.469 --> 31:45.951
You're already refining it now, aren't you?

31:47.513 --> 31:49.395
Well, how do you say this is the first book?

31:50.777 --> 31:52.019
It's very interesting.

31:52.039 --> 31:53.921
The man is still publishing today.

31:53.942 --> 31:57.146
He didn't give me the title, by the way.

31:57.166 --> 31:58.688
He translates as Crops...

31:59.123 --> 31:59.744
And metal.

32:00.605 --> 32:02.467
There's what in metal?

32:02.487 --> 32:02.927
Crops.

32:03.308 --> 32:04.749
C-R-O-P-S.

32:04.769 --> 32:05.390
What is that word?

32:05.410 --> 32:06.491
Agricultural crops.

32:06.511 --> 32:07.132
Oh, crops.

32:07.272 --> 32:07.613
I'm sorry.

32:07.853 --> 32:09.234
Crops and metal.

32:09.254 --> 32:09.415
Yeah.

32:11.577 --> 32:11.998
I don't know.

32:12.258 --> 32:12.859
These are stories?

32:12.899 --> 32:13.139
Yeah.

32:13.639 --> 32:15.101
The man is still writing today.

32:15.141 --> 32:15.902
These are stories.

32:16.002 --> 32:16.262
Yeah.

32:16.343 --> 32:24.852
The man is still writing today, and his new book is coming out next month from Grove Weidenfeld, a novel.

32:26.894 --> 32:27.015
Hmm.

32:27.035 --> 32:27.375
So what?

32:27.558 --> 32:30.961
We span May 6th, 1948, and here we are, 1991.

32:32.703 --> 32:34.105
Another book's coming out in English.

32:34.365 --> 32:44.275
It actually encompasses the whole... At one time, he was cultural council in New York.

32:44.335 --> 32:45.776
He's been to my home many times.

32:45.976 --> 32:46.937
This is the first book.

32:47.758 --> 32:52.503
I have not been able to find one because I'm using his judgment that he remembers the spring of 1948.

32:54.125 --> 32:55.506
If it had been before...

32:56.178 --> 33:02.027
The spring of 48, it would have been called Land of Palestine.

33:02.047 --> 33:04.370
If you want to, I'll show you the one that says Land of Palestine.

33:04.390 --> 33:05.231
They say he's been here.

33:05.251 --> 33:13.924
You bring these people over as part of a cultural... No, these people travel under various paths, but also sponsoring their own books.

33:14.224 --> 33:22.096
And in the early years, I used to take care of them and pick them up at airports, and they would stay with me, and I would feed them and things like that.

33:22.116 --> 33:24.379
I don't do as much of that as I do anymore.

33:24.747 --> 33:26.310
I told you David Grossman was here, no?

33:28.133 --> 33:30.076
You're kind of an activist collector, aren't you?

33:30.157 --> 33:30.998
No, I'm a fanatic.

33:33.222 --> 33:35.025
I mean, it's in the book.

33:37.369 --> 33:39.974
It's the creator of the town, and not the creative.

33:39.994 --> 33:45.364
You collect writers as much as you do Shirley Holsten says that I really should have them watch.

33:45.384 --> 33:46.225
The Combs in Rome?

33:46.405 --> 33:48.409
Have you seen that with the people who are on the shelves?

33:49.486 --> 33:54.033
So that's an accurate assessment thing.

33:54.053 --> 33:55.015
You do collect writers.

33:56.417 --> 33:56.677
Yes.

33:56.837 --> 34:03.528
The collection in Jerusalem will be called the Archives of Israeli Writers, as opposed to the Archives of Israeli Literature.

34:05.471 --> 34:07.334
I suggested Archives of Israeli Literature.

34:07.354 --> 34:10.138
They suggested Archives of Israeli Writers, and I said, fine.

34:12.261 --> 34:13.143
There is a distinction.

34:13.303 --> 34:15.005
Why did they make that suggestion?

34:15.065 --> 34:15.827
I'm surprised you didn't.

34:15.847 --> 34:16.708
I'm not sure why.

34:16.874 --> 34:23.601
That sounds like something you should have suggested.

34:23.741 --> 34:25.282
I can't recapitulate it.

34:25.382 --> 34:25.523
Sorry.

34:25.583 --> 34:27.144
When do you expect to present this?

34:28.546 --> 34:30.928
When the room is in with the bookcases.

34:30.948 --> 34:32.510
Is that in progress?

34:32.530 --> 34:33.190
Is that in a way?

34:33.631 --> 34:35.412
Five of the cases.

34:35.432 --> 34:36.834
Case four and five are being built.

34:38.335 --> 34:43.000
And my main obstacle...

34:44.144 --> 34:59.582
remain, not in physically transferring them from my shelf to these cases, but trying to establish some kind of form of procedures on what to do with them and how to use them.

35:01.184 --> 35:08.792
My cataloging I'm showing you now is a little bit primitive.

35:11.576 --> 35:12.256
I have two of these.

35:12.417 --> 35:13.678
How many cards in that drawer?

35:13.996 --> 35:15.198
Yeah, 1,300?

35:16.259 --> 35:16.780
Couldn't tell you.

35:16.800 --> 35:17.220
1,500?

35:17.301 --> 35:18.322
I don't know.

35:18.542 --> 35:19.664
I used to know.

35:19.684 --> 35:21.106
Okay.

35:21.126 --> 35:23.669
Sometimes in the early days... About 14 inches.

35:23.709 --> 35:26.513
In the early days, I would have somebody come in with a Hebrew typewriter.

35:28.596 --> 35:32.802
Now, I do them all by hand, and I don't know what I'm doing.

35:35.125 --> 35:37.769
Your card cataloging is different than this.

35:39.411 --> 35:43.817
I'm going to insist that the card cataloging is a combination of theirs and mine.

35:45.130 --> 35:47.072
as I described with the architectural.

35:48.333 --> 35:50.395
It's even more complicated when you get into this.

35:52.817 --> 36:04.729
I don't like it when I come to a book in Russian or a book in Hebrew, where nothing in the book, the old-fashioned publishers continue to publish nothing in the book in English.

36:05.169 --> 36:10.334
The more modern publishers have universal translations and then something in English that I can relate to.

36:10.834 --> 36:13.517
But I resent it with the idea that I am not interested

36:14.341 --> 36:18.946
You know, the poor Christian Macaroni, Israeli writers, just because I don't read Hebrew.

36:19.206 --> 36:23.190
I resent the fact that I'm not supposed to look at a card catalog card.

36:24.491 --> 36:25.852
The public library is bobbing to me.

36:26.713 --> 36:31.899
And I said to the man, it doesn't have something in English.

36:33.000 --> 36:36.043
I said, well, if it was in that language, why bother?

36:36.063 --> 36:39.526
I mean, maybe there's a reason.

36:39.546 --> 36:41.428
If it's original, then you can't read the book, right?

36:43.771 --> 36:46.413
Oh, idea of a card is to assist the reader.

36:47.735 --> 36:48.795
Let's see your point.

36:49.616 --> 36:53.300
I go past readership.

36:53.380 --> 36:57.263
I'm not going to read the book, but I'm going to understand the book maybe better than the reader.

36:57.583 --> 37:01.247
And I will read it in translation, hopefully someday.

37:01.267 --> 37:02.468
I want access to that card.

37:02.968 --> 37:04.890
I want to make that card.

37:05.130 --> 37:05.791
Oh, I am.

37:07.652 --> 37:08.693
Okay, let's go.

37:09.714 --> 37:11.736
It's called transliteration.

37:12.037 --> 37:15.121
You asked me how I handled it.

37:16.102 --> 37:18.384
I did.

37:18.424 --> 37:21.728
Let's move to the Soviet.

37:22.008 --> 37:25.052
Let's talk about how that developed from the Israeli.

37:25.893 --> 37:31.699
In 1958 we were there for a week and I didn't get the understanding that I should be moving.

37:31.900 --> 37:35.344
You were there being the Soviet Union?

37:35.364 --> 37:35.564
Yeah.

37:35.584 --> 37:39.208
Dr. Zhivago, but I didn't know enough to go and visit him.

37:39.779 --> 37:40.480
Pasternak.

37:41.160 --> 37:41.881
He died in 60.

37:41.901 --> 37:43.342
Do you regret that to this day?

37:43.463 --> 37:45.484
Okay.

37:45.504 --> 37:46.265
I know his family.

37:47.326 --> 37:48.187
And I visit his family.

37:48.667 --> 37:53.772
And I've been, every trip I go to the Dasha that he lived in, Peridelfina.

37:53.792 --> 37:56.515
And they're making the shrine out of it in the museum and stuff like that.

37:56.575 --> 37:57.796
And we had the opening last year.

37:59.738 --> 38:03.902
As a precious, as a precious to the Russian Soviets.

38:04.082 --> 38:04.663
Name it for me.

38:04.703 --> 38:05.483
Name the collection.

38:05.824 --> 38:06.985
Give me what you're saying.

38:07.005 --> 38:08.166
Five, great.

38:08.939 --> 38:15.247
Nineteenth-century Christian novelist.

38:15.267 --> 38:18.450
First works in English.

38:18.470 --> 38:21.574
This is my beginning of the Soviet.

38:22.635 --> 38:25.038
I have Gogol, First Gen S.C.S.P.

38:25.118 --> 38:25.939
Sergainis.

38:26.961 --> 38:28.402
The First War and Peace in English.

38:28.442 --> 38:31.526
I have the First Antichristian in English.

38:32.027 --> 38:36.352
You have three sets.

38:36.372 --> 38:36.432
No.

38:36.901 --> 38:38.363
The first set was done.

38:38.543 --> 38:40.806
I found a paper set, which is very, very rare.

38:41.667 --> 38:46.194
The paper set then advertises it's available in cloth.

38:46.334 --> 38:49.718
The cloth set doesn't say anything about that it's available in paper.

38:50.059 --> 38:50.640
Very interesting.

38:52.642 --> 38:53.483
Publish it in English.

38:53.984 --> 38:54.304
It's British?

38:54.585 --> 38:55.005
That's fine.

38:55.025 --> 38:55.947
I see it.

38:55.967 --> 38:56.447
It's American.

38:56.728 --> 38:58.470
Okay.

38:58.490 --> 38:59.091
It's American.

39:00.473 --> 39:00.573
Yeah.

39:00.593 --> 39:03.136
Some of the first—these are first printings in English.

39:03.297 --> 39:05.500
I don't care whether they were done in England or in America.

39:05.520 --> 39:06.621
I understand, yeah.

39:06.888 --> 39:09.251
I was a little surprised it was done in America before.

39:09.291 --> 39:09.972
Oh, that's right.

39:11.494 --> 39:12.375
You won't believe this one.

39:14.638 --> 39:15.219
It was in St.

39:15.239 --> 39:16.241
Petersburg, 1893.

39:16.261 --> 39:19.044
Count Tolstoy.

39:20.166 --> 39:20.907
Record show.

39:21.107 --> 39:23.550
Only Yale and what's... New York Public Library.

39:24.091 --> 39:24.972
New York Public Library.

39:24.992 --> 39:25.793
The only other copy.

39:25.974 --> 39:26.334
Is what?

39:27.956 --> 39:28.437
Copy three.

39:28.477 --> 39:29.959
The title for my thing is...

39:30.428 --> 39:36.236
The Caucasian, C-A-U-C-A-S-I-A-N, captive, a true story about Count Tolstoy, T-O-L-S-T-O-Y.

39:36.256 --> 39:36.977
In English.

39:36.997 --> 39:37.397
In English.

39:38.539 --> 39:39.099
Printed where?

39:39.119 --> 39:39.600
In St.

39:39.640 --> 39:40.221
Petersburg.

39:41.863 --> 39:43.665
New York Public Library in Yale.

39:44.987 --> 39:45.548
And Holtzman.

39:47.430 --> 39:50.755
I went to New York Public Library, and they brought their copy out.

39:51.676 --> 39:58.665
And there was two out of three together, and I compared them.

39:58.685 --> 39:59.406
Where did you get that?

40:00.668 --> 40:02.130
Peter Howard found it.

40:04.233 --> 40:13.406
Most academics of Slavic literature don't pay any attention to anything than the work in the original language.

40:13.426 --> 40:19.575
Toby Holtz and a few other people are respecting works and translations.

40:20.516 --> 40:26.845
The earliest translations are the best, not quality-wise, but the fact that they're the first time

40:27.500 --> 40:32.527
that the English-speaking world, to even know that such a thing exists, gets access to it.

40:32.687 --> 40:33.949
And I love the introduction.

40:37.794 --> 40:45.726
I used to spend a pound in London in the 50s.

40:46.527 --> 40:53.136
Now these books are getting very, very expensive, and I don't buy them at the expensive prices.

40:53.156 --> 40:56.781
The five again are Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, Turgenev, Pushkin,

40:57.115 --> 40:58.997
And Gogol, G-O-G-O-L.

41:01.460 --> 41:08.289
I was 19 years old, writing from scratch.

41:09.611 --> 41:11.693
What would I collect?

41:11.713 --> 41:22.227
I have told myself over the years that I probably would collect those English translations of great works, right?

41:23.808 --> 41:25.030
That's an interesting collection.

41:26.782 --> 41:29.605
Clearly, somebody must do this, though.

41:29.625 --> 41:30.626
I'll bet you Harvard does it.

41:30.666 --> 41:31.807
I'll bet you they just don't know it.

41:32.488 --> 41:33.149
I'll bet they haven't.

41:33.269 --> 41:34.310
It's a cross-collect.

41:34.330 --> 41:36.032
Yeah.

41:36.052 --> 41:36.112
OK.

41:36.132 --> 41:37.374
This is the key book.

41:37.694 --> 41:38.955
It's available in the reprint.

41:38.975 --> 41:40.397
It's absolutely marvelous.

41:41.158 --> 41:42.059
It's to 1900.

41:42.539 --> 41:43.320
That's a nice book.

41:43.981 --> 41:44.341
Excuse me.

41:44.361 --> 41:45.502
Let me just write down this.

41:45.522 --> 41:46.403
It's sublime.

41:48.105 --> 41:50.608
That's the reference I'm going to look for.

41:50.628 --> 41:50.748
Yeah.

41:50.768 --> 41:51.249
Absolutely sublime.

41:51.269 --> 41:51.589
I can't.

41:51.609 --> 41:52.570
I'm going to sit down.

41:53.275 --> 41:54.797
I can't sit down on that.

41:55.278 --> 41:56.660
Here's how you're going to buy it.

41:56.680 --> 41:58.182
It's available through Bancroft.

41:59.404 --> 42:02.168
First, because I said bibliographically, I need this book.

42:03.149 --> 42:04.491
It's available through Fulcret.

42:04.511 --> 42:09.558
Magic moments being right now, you're saying the first time.

42:10.339 --> 42:12.382
It was the first translation of 1777.

42:12.883 --> 42:16.768
It's Aeschylus, A-E-S-C-H-Y-L-U-S.

42:20.528 --> 42:21.429
You'd like to sort it.

42:21.449 --> 42:32.904
You'd probably like to take that book and get all the... I have seen two or three catalogs in the last few years offering classics and translations.

42:33.865 --> 42:36.228
Not the first ten things.

42:36.248 --> 42:37.209
I'm just talking basically.

42:37.229 --> 42:38.131
You don't think.

42:39.833 --> 42:41.034
So again, there's a higher form.

42:41.735 --> 42:42.456
Here's what I do.

42:42.877 --> 42:44.599
Look at the Talmud.

42:44.619 --> 42:47.122
You talk about incredible.

42:47.643 --> 42:49.405
That's a pretty interesting book.

42:50.127 --> 42:51.589
It changed my life.

42:52.730 --> 42:53.731
I make a checklist, see?

42:54.272 --> 43:02.021
I own the... And I edit things, and then I stop it, because there's another one that carries on.

43:02.261 --> 43:04.143
But you understand there's no publisher.

43:05.665 --> 43:07.968
I've got another one with a publisher.

43:07.988 --> 43:08.909
I'm just telling you, Harris.

43:09.790 --> 43:11.852
First English translation, think of it.

43:11.873 --> 43:13.294
The first time in the world.

43:14.936 --> 43:16.077
Dante's Inferno.

43:18.000 --> 43:18.440
Great book.

43:19.902 --> 43:19.982
Hmm?

43:22.274 --> 43:26.158
You understand that the first ones are not only incomplete, but poor.

43:26.178 --> 43:27.099
But it doesn't matter.

43:27.479 --> 43:30.562
To me, it's the point in time that counts.

43:31.643 --> 43:38.010
It has been said that Dante is the most influential poet on English writers writing in another language.

43:38.290 --> 43:38.810
Did you know that?

43:39.251 --> 43:41.493
Yes, but you understand there's two kinds of English poets.

43:41.513 --> 43:45.857
The ones that could read them in the Italian and the ones that had to wait until 1802 to read them in English.

43:46.098 --> 43:47.599
Blake went and learned Italian.

43:47.679 --> 43:48.520
Well, that's unfair.

43:48.540 --> 43:51.403
So he could read Dante in the original so he could do his illustrations.

43:53.358 --> 43:58.945
The great American critic, Edmund Wolfman, learned Hebrew in order to write a book on the Dead Sea Scrolls.

43:59.706 --> 44:03.991
He learned Russian in order to write a book about Holtzman.

44:04.011 --> 44:12.381
You're talking about critics who were a little bit curiously.

44:14.564 --> 44:16.526
What's the difference?

44:16.706 --> 44:21.492
Toby Holtzman continues to think that he might have gone in this direction.

44:22.214 --> 44:25.359
Well, what happens when you empty these shelves and send them off to Jerusalem?

44:25.379 --> 44:27.181
What are you going to put in there?

44:27.221 --> 44:29.304
The second copies that are in the attic, remember that?

44:33.190 --> 44:35.033
Okay, now we get into the classic.

44:35.233 --> 44:36.955
I want to talk about the Soviet definition.

44:37.937 --> 44:47.070
In 1917, the Tsarist period ended, and it was then the Union of Soviet Social Republic.

44:48.072 --> 44:50.415
And Soviet means council.

44:50.682 --> 44:55.269
we called the people they're Soviets as opposed to Russians.

44:56.030 --> 45:03.460
When Joseph Brodsky left in 1972, he became a Russian writer.

45:03.480 --> 45:09.729
While he was in the Soviet Union, he was very scarcely published, but he was a Soviet writer.

45:09.989 --> 45:13.054
That's the distinction that some of us make between the Russians.

45:13.074 --> 45:17.540
Again, it's very hard to distinguish who's a Soviet writer as opposed to who's a Russian writer.

45:17.620 --> 45:20.284
Soviets now accept the fact that the emigres

45:20.534 --> 45:26.584
are welcome back and are under the old Russian literature.

45:26.604 --> 45:32.293
Years ago, he didn't like the word Russian literature at all, he wanted to call it Soviet literature.

45:32.313 --> 45:33.074
So here we go.

45:33.475 --> 45:35.298
What the hell is the name of this collection?

45:35.358 --> 45:37.682
And it's interesting, I still call it Soviet literature.

45:37.802 --> 45:39.805
Okay, what are you collecting it for?

45:39.825 --> 45:42.930
Does this have a destination?

45:43.872 --> 45:54.701
If in this country it's possible at Stanford University, because of my thoughts in terms of the Israeli National Library, they also have expressed great interest in it.

45:54.721 --> 45:57.884
So you're looking for a home, a good home?

45:57.904 --> 45:59.225
Well, I would consider a good home.

45:59.265 --> 46:05.991
I'm not ready to make the divestiture because, in order, I worked for several years on the Faulkner and I'm now working on the Israeli.

46:07.092 --> 46:09.814
I prefer to think that I've got to do it or not.

46:09.834 --> 46:11.696
How long did you work on the Faulkner?

46:11.716 --> 46:12.917
Before divestiture?

46:13.252 --> 46:18.137
I started with the first book was The Portable Falcon, which came out in 1946.

46:18.197 --> 46:37.156
The Soviet started with, and it continues to be the biggest collection as well as the most valuable collection, Pasternak as an individual Soviet writer.

46:37.176 --> 46:42.702
So you're looking here at Boris Pasternak, one of the better collections in the West.

46:43.255 --> 46:49.742
And I've been told it's much better than Harvard, much better than Stanford, and much better than a combination of Harvard and Stanford and Yale.

46:50.062 --> 46:53.986
How many titles on Pasternak, roughly?

46:54.607 --> 46:56.749
Well, there's roughly 50 on a thing here.

46:57.129 --> 47:00.032
So you've got 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50.

47:00.192 --> 47:02.595
There's other stuff, and I have other stuff upstairs.

47:02.755 --> 47:08.060
And I have materials that I haven't even... Anything inscribed by Pasternak here?

47:08.120 --> 47:08.341
Yeah.

47:08.701 --> 47:12.705
I have about two books inscribed by Pasternak.

47:13.276 --> 47:16.781
And I have some original material here that I haven't even gotten into yet.

47:20.687 --> 47:21.048
Okay.

47:21.348 --> 47:23.412
Can we go sit and talk now someplace?

47:24.393 --> 47:25.895
Is there anything else here I have to see?

47:26.096 --> 47:26.636
I should see.

47:27.938 --> 47:36.572
One of the things that I always did is separate the living writers and the ones who die.

47:37.934 --> 47:42.000
When I started on Israeli literature in 1973, everybody was alive.

47:44.225 --> 47:48.609
of time, one by each, they get separated when they die.

47:49.750 --> 47:53.954
As soon as I find out about it, they are taken from here and elevated.

47:56.496 --> 47:59.679
It starts with A, right here, starting with Agna.

48:00.680 --> 48:02.362
And these are the ones who passed away.

48:02.462 --> 48:04.684
This is Don Benemot, my friend, that I told you about.

48:04.824 --> 48:06.906
Why is it important to separate the living from the dead?

48:08.287 --> 48:13.152
For instance, know that this is, I better see this guy, and it's

48:13.503 --> 48:15.226
too late worrying about that guy.

48:15.246 --> 48:17.249
Again, by staring at him physically.

48:18.190 --> 48:22.177
When you say seeing them, you mean seeking them out, making their acquaintance.

48:22.257 --> 48:22.878
Communicating.

48:23.238 --> 48:24.320
Communicating.

48:24.340 --> 48:32.893
I also feel that when I show somebody and they say, oh, I'm next to somebody and I'm next to somebody, they're not next to somebody who's passed on.

48:33.234 --> 48:33.975
In other words,

48:34.917 --> 48:38.943
In the culture, they exist alive and dead.

48:38.983 --> 48:42.889
I have a big thing about life and death.

48:47.015 --> 48:48.998
That is one of the great novels.

48:49.599 --> 48:55.648
It may be one of the three great novels of Soviet literature.

48:55.668 --> 48:57.551
Not to be published during his lifetime.

48:57.951 --> 49:03.760
V-A-S-I-L-Y, Grossman, V-O-S-S-N-E, and Life, Ampersand, and Fate.

49:04.955 --> 49:26.338
In Tel Aviv, in May, seeking out Israeli literature, this insanely rare little thing, in Hebrew, printed in Israel, pre-state printed in Tel Aviv, Vasily Grossman's account of the first time that he found a concentration camp.

49:27.059 --> 49:34.827
Stalin, Lett, Grossman, and Ehrenberg, the creative reporters, to show the world how bad the fascists were.

49:35.465 --> 49:42.014
And they entered the camp, the West about the camp, and the West didn't pay any attention to enter a camp and write about it.

49:42.535 --> 49:44.097
And it came out in this little format.

49:44.398 --> 49:44.939
Great writer.

49:45.860 --> 49:46.441
Great writer.

49:47.462 --> 50:04.847
Again and again and again, with the exception of Pasternak and Isaac Babel, my Soviet literature is more memorable, finest condition possible of

50:05.570 --> 50:06.431
Works in English.

50:07.513 --> 50:08.555
Translation.

50:08.575 --> 50:10.538
Book defined looking like that.

50:11.620 --> 50:13.283
Tillyak happens to be one of the great writers.

50:14.024 --> 50:16.368
But I'm talking about fine copy.

50:16.628 --> 50:18.591
Very small printing of all of these guys.

50:19.132 --> 50:24.882
You care about condition then, of course, as all... Condition isn't everything.

50:25.142 --> 50:26.925
It's the only thing.

50:26.945 --> 50:27.847
Like since Lombardi.

50:27.907 --> 50:28.287
Modern.

50:29.349 --> 50:30.251
Book.

50:30.271 --> 50:30.531
Collection.

50:31.439 --> 50:37.848
If you're going to go and collect Dante in the 17th century, the condition then becomes also relative.

50:39.770 --> 50:44.176
I tend to accept in the Russian a condition.

50:46.179 --> 50:51.927
I'm really not collecting these books except Pasternak and Babel, but I will accept this because of being a few rubles.

50:52.688 --> 50:53.469
I will accept this.

50:53.669 --> 50:55.892
And that's the only thing that's coming out now.

50:55.912 --> 50:59.978
The fine condition hasn't come out yet because the prices haven't come high enough.

51:00.751 --> 51:03.994
I accept that, and I accept that in the Israeli also.

51:06.337 --> 51:06.677
Interesting.

51:06.817 --> 51:09.080
But I won't accept it in the translation.

51:09.580 --> 51:12.764
I won't accept it.

51:14.846 --> 51:19.992
But I tend to accept it less than mint in the original language.

51:20.012 --> 51:23.275
That's the way I operate.

51:23.295 --> 51:24.516
I don't know what the standards are.

51:24.637 --> 51:26.238
I don't know what the game is.

51:26.258 --> 51:29.161
Well, so you get one, and if you can get better, then you do that too, right?

51:29.662 --> 51:29.762
Yeah.

51:30.535 --> 51:35.823
...in Rostov on the... in Vesneskaya.

51:35.843 --> 51:44.155
...contacts with a good literature, Joseph Becain.

51:44.175 --> 51:57.194
...and the Nobel Prize I made in his honor and distributed a... ...a checklist of his work and gave him something.

51:57.214 --> 51:59.698
The incorrect is one for me.

52:03.357 --> 52:14.389
New York Public Library, and they showed me an exhibit case of Joseph Whitcase, honoring his, you know, showing some of his works that they have.

52:17.372 --> 52:22.317
I have more than that, and I said, of course you do.

52:22.337 --> 52:25.821
That's valid me a lot.

52:25.841 --> 52:30.766
Public division in the New York Public Library.

52:30.786 --> 52:31.407
I'm having a complete question.

52:32.939 --> 52:34.520
The libraries defend on people like you.

52:35.181 --> 52:36.322
I'll be frank with you.

52:36.342 --> 52:38.424
The physicians' people.

52:38.444 --> 52:40.446
From the Slavic Division on down.

52:41.047 --> 52:41.847
That's what I am.

52:43.549 --> 52:45.691
Arrest to you.

52:45.711 --> 52:49.034
To which I say, phooey.

52:49.054 --> 52:52.197
I'm glad you didn't catch that, but I mean, to which I say, phooey.

52:52.217 --> 52:54.940
I mean, I don't understand how that's going to influence me.

52:54.960 --> 52:56.982
And I think that Joseph is a force of me.

52:57.002 --> 52:59.264
Right now, he's a force of us.

52:59.284 --> 53:00.685
I don't care about this arrest to you.

53:03.061 --> 53:08.232
When I offered my Faulkner to the New York Public Library, you offered it to New York Public Library?

53:08.252 --> 53:08.352
Yeah.

53:08.372 --> 53:12.520
The Varian was in Spain, and this girl says, he goes to Lola.

53:12.540 --> 53:13.262
Lola's flat.

53:13.542 --> 53:15.306
And everybody's talking to the wall.

53:15.326 --> 53:21.238
That's how uncommon we have.
