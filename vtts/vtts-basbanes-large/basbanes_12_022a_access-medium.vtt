00:03.305 --> 00:12.615
Go ahead, please.

00:12.635 --> 00:18.061
Perhaps one of the most interesting words in the English language today is the word fuck.

00:19.082 --> 00:25.529
Out of all of the English words that begin with the letter F, fuck is the only word that is referred to as the F word.

00:26.330 --> 00:33.278
It's the one magical word, just by its sound, can describe pain, pleasure, hate, and love.

00:33.460 --> 00:41.247
Fuck, as most words in the English language, is derived from German, the word flicken, which means strike.

00:41.267 --> 00:44.751
In English, fuck falls into many grammatical categories.

00:45.391 --> 00:49.075
As a transitive verb, for instance, John fucked Shirley.

00:50.036 --> 00:52.658
As an intransitive verb, Shirley fucks.

00:53.579 --> 00:55.241
Its meaning is not always sexual.

00:55.581 --> 01:00.025
It can be used as an adjective, such as, John's doing all the fucking work.

01:00.393 --> 01:04.298
As part of an adverb, surely talks too fucking much.

01:05.199 --> 01:09.765
As an adverb, enhancing an adjective, surely is fucking beautiful.

01:10.686 --> 01:13.169
As a noun, I don't give a fuck.

01:13.710 --> 01:18.395
As part of a word, abso-fucking-lutely, or in-fucking-credible.

01:19.076 --> 01:23.802
And, as almost every word in a sentence, fuck the fucking suckers.

01:24.440 --> 01:28.245
As you must realize, there aren't too many words with the versatility of fuck.

01:28.845 --> 01:32.570
As in these examples describing situations such as fraud.

01:33.271 --> 01:35.113
I got fucked at the used car lot.

01:35.894 --> 01:36.435
Dismay.

01:37.036 --> 01:37.737
Aw, fuck it.

01:38.517 --> 01:38.938
Trouble.

01:39.519 --> 01:41.281
I guess I'm really fucked now.

01:42.062 --> 01:43.103
Aggression.

01:43.123 --> 01:44.425
Don't fuck with me, buddy.

01:45.266 --> 01:45.927
Difficulty.

01:46.527 --> 01:48.690
I don't understand this fucking question.

01:49.571 --> 01:50.112
Inquiry.

01:50.472 --> 01:51.814
Who the fuck was that?

01:52.402 --> 01:53.565
Dissatisfaction.

01:54.207 --> 01:56.133
I don't like what the fuck is going on here.

01:56.193 --> 01:57.757
Inconfidence.

01:58.299 --> 01:59.322
He's a fuck off.

02:00.244 --> 02:00.946

02:01.548 --> 02:04.757

02:05.378 --> 02:08.942
I'm sure you can think of many more examples.

02:08.962 --> 02:14.387
With all of these multi-purpose applications, how can anyone be offended when you use the word?

02:15.288 --> 02:20.834
We say, use this unique, flexible word more often than your daily speech.

02:20.854 --> 02:24.217
It will identify the quality of your character immediately.

02:25.318 --> 02:27.240
Say it loudly and proudly.

02:28.381 --> 02:29.342
Fuck you!

02:33.507 --> 02:34.828
Here, 23.
