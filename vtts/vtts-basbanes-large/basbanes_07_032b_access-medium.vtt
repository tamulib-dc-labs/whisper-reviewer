WEBVTT

00:03.288 --> 00:06.712
Okay, we're on side two now.

00:06.732 --> 00:15.503
One thing you mentioned in your Logan book is that he really was not concerned about rarity or value or scarcity.

00:15.523 --> 00:16.143
The text.

00:16.484 --> 00:19.427
You use the phrase good books, not rare books.

00:19.528 --> 00:23.833
Well, the best edition rather than the first edition.

00:23.853 --> 00:25.154
Because that was quite irrelevant.

00:25.234 --> 00:29.720
Scarcity was, in terms of value, was quite irrelevant to him, I gather.

00:31.462 --> 00:32.383
How does his taste

00:32.988 --> 00:35.511
stand up now over the centuries in books.

00:36.292 --> 00:59.541
Well, he has, in many instances, the best edition, but as I say, he didn't want to buy a Venice 1470 Dandy, which he could have, and bought instead a later one with notes.

01:00.182 --> 01:00.582
Well,

01:00.983 --> 01:02.345
Too bad.

01:02.725 --> 01:06.991
Are you setting a specific case?

01:07.652 --> 01:09.555
He did have an opportunity to get that done?

01:09.575 --> 01:10.596
That's right.

01:10.616 --> 01:11.438
How did you know this?

01:11.458 --> 01:12.499
From a letter.

01:13.500 --> 01:18.928
I mean, he complained about the price of one, you see, and then ordered another.

01:21.432 --> 01:24.155
Then go for a million and a half and sell the piece.

01:24.175 --> 01:26.919
Too bad, you see.

01:27.280 --> 01:29.623
But that's how I know about it.

01:30.363 --> 01:33.627
But this was typical of him, you see.

01:34.528 --> 01:57.754
He wanted a specific edition or a specific book, and when he went off on a track, for instance, he started thinking about the Near East, and he started buying books on the Near East, the cradle of civilization.

01:58.190 --> 02:01.053
Not describe him, say, as a humanist, the way with Jefferson?

02:01.593 --> 02:05.017
Oh, he was very definitely a humanist.

02:05.037 --> 02:18.610
Very definitely, if you... Nothing that was foreign to man or humanity was foreign to him.

02:18.630 --> 02:20.612
And he wasn't intimidated by thought.

02:21.132 --> 02:25.276
No, he was not intimidated by thought or language.

02:25.356 --> 02:26.998
I mean, he taught himself Arabic.

02:28.565 --> 02:29.987
He knew Hebrew.

02:31.849 --> 02:34.352
An amazing, amazing man.

02:34.372 --> 02:35.253
It's quite an extraordinary story, isn't it?

02:35.273 --> 02:35.713
Yeah.

02:35.733 --> 02:41.340
An amazing man, that a man should have had his scientific interests.

02:42.201 --> 02:47.567
He had a telescope, and he made certain observations, astronomical observations.

02:48.067 --> 02:51.491
Do you think he saw himself as being in a frontier?

02:52.472 --> 02:53.914
Oh, definitely.

02:54.232 --> 02:55.553
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

02:55.774 --> 02:57.355
An intellectual wilderness?

02:57.656 --> 02:59.217
No question about it.

02:59.237 --> 03:01.079
And he really got to make do with what he could do.

03:01.159 --> 03:02.801
And he went.

03:03.602 --> 03:12.411
After he came to America the first time, he went back to England twice on the proprietary business.

03:13.312 --> 03:15.594
And each time he had himself a ball.

03:15.634 --> 03:19.618
He went to see what all the other people in London were doing.

03:20.359 --> 03:22.521
And it was an exciting thing for him.

03:22.541 --> 03:23.462
He went to a...

03:23.813 --> 03:29.460
meeting of the Royal Society at which Newton was presiding.

03:29.901 --> 03:35.228
That kind of thing it gave him, you know, made him feel, well, this is my world.

03:36.369 --> 03:51.669
Another thing you mentioned in your Wolf book, I'm sorry, the Logan book, is that, and I even maybe see a chapter opening with this, because it kind of is, Benjamin Franklin wrote his obituary in the Gazette.

03:51.689 --> 03:52.150
There you have one.

03:52.805 --> 04:10.660
Well, he... Well, except that Franklin never had the various abilities, the skills that Logan acquired.

04:10.800 --> 04:18.087
He had a quicker mind, I would guess, quicker mind in the sense that he was willing to experiment.

04:19.488 --> 04:22.170
And he observed.

04:23.348 --> 04:36.827
Uh, Logan wrote a, started writing, never finished, a long theological work, which has never been, uh, philosophical work, which has never been printed.

04:37.187 --> 04:37.768
And that was here?

04:38.409 --> 04:39.150
Next door.

04:39.230 --> 04:41.934
All the Logan manuscripts are next door.

04:41.994 --> 04:43.776
The books are all here.

04:45.319 --> 04:51.006
Um, but I found it very difficult to follow.

04:52.028 --> 04:52.849
He, uh,

04:53.892 --> 04:59.580
wrote long, complicated sentences that never seem to end.

05:00.541 --> 05:14.841
And he wrote long, complicated sentences in Latin as well as in English, with relative clause piled upon relative clause and phrases between them.

05:15.942 --> 05:21.790
And it's quite something to work through.

05:22.748 --> 05:25.916
And then we have the legacy of his books, though.

05:26.217 --> 05:32.815
It really was important to him that these books be left for him.

05:32.835 --> 05:37.467
For the public use, but he really knew better.

05:38.009 --> 05:39.272
The public never used them.

05:41.969 --> 05:43.892
But nevertheless, he wanted them to be available.

05:43.992 --> 05:47.036
He wanted them to be available, but... The public never used them?

05:47.056 --> 05:47.437
No.

05:47.637 --> 05:50.521
Who could read Arabic and fill it up?

05:51.722 --> 05:55.908
How many people could use calculus?

05:56.950 --> 06:00.014
They were... Well, you've got an Ivy League school here in the city.

06:00.334 --> 06:00.414
Why?

06:00.434 --> 06:11.149
You have an Ivy League school here in the city with a... Yes, but I'm talking now about the 18th and early 19th century, and it

06:12.277 --> 06:24.795
Really, it was not the kind of library that any but scholars in an academic setting would have had any interest in.

06:24.815 --> 06:41.659
And with all due regard to Penn and the College of Philadelphia and the eventual University of Pennsylvania, I don't think it was a research institution until very much later.

06:42.972 --> 06:45.815
And the books are only good for research.

06:48.198 --> 06:50.361
Do you think they have ever been used for research?

06:51.022 --> 06:51.963
Oh, yes.

06:51.983 --> 06:55.687
I mean, since we've turned them up and so forth and so on.

06:55.707 --> 06:56.508
So it took a while.

06:56.789 --> 06:58.451
It took quite a while.

06:58.471 --> 07:00.313
But it was still a worthwhile request.

07:00.573 --> 07:01.094
Oh, yes.

07:01.174 --> 07:02.415
Now they're here.

07:02.435 --> 07:07.922
Even though they weren't used immediately, there they stayed.

07:08.102 --> 07:10.465
Well, we had, oh, this was a couple of years ago,

07:11.103 --> 07:24.758
There was an editor of Euclid named Clavis, and there was a Jesuit scholar who was working on them, where we had a lot of his books.

07:24.778 --> 07:28.322
Are there any items in his library that really can't be found anyplace else?

07:28.522 --> 07:29.243
I would guess so.

07:29.303 --> 07:34.108
I mean, I've never gone into that and trying to find out whether it's the other.

07:34.529 --> 07:40.435
I do know there is one edition of Ptolemy, Ptolemy's Geography, in his library.

07:40.938 --> 07:44.923
of which they can't find another, or hadn't found another copy.

07:45.143 --> 07:46.305
Where was it printed?

07:46.946 --> 07:49.990
I disremember at the moment.

07:50.190 --> 07:52.393
But it was printed in the 16th century.

07:52.413 --> 07:58.761
It's not nearly the first edition, but something like 1548 or 1449.

07:58.841 --> 08:00.563
It's a fascinating story.

08:01.024 --> 08:04.028
He was certainly not a man of his times, was he?

08:04.048 --> 08:09.595
Yes, he was a man of his times, because there were polymaths in Europe,

08:10.385 --> 08:12.528
and in England at that time.

08:13.790 --> 08:27.831
And, yes, he just didn't happen to be typical of an American frontier, a man who entertained Indians at his house at Stanton.

08:27.851 --> 08:29.012
He never did that, I'm sure.

08:29.053 --> 08:29.453
He did.

08:29.493 --> 08:29.854
He did?

08:29.894 --> 08:30.815
He did, indeed.

08:32.458 --> 08:33.439
Oh, yes.

08:33.459 --> 08:35.742
Now, was this, do you think, kind of a field trip for him, or...?

08:35.762 --> 08:37.104
No, no, no.

08:37.124 --> 08:39.548
It was part of his job as the

08:39.882 --> 08:41.704
agent of the proprietor.

08:42.105 --> 08:42.445
Wow.

08:43.507 --> 08:50.636
No, no, he was, and he was active in the Indian trade.

08:50.776 --> 08:52.558
I mean, that's where he got his furs.

08:53.219 --> 08:56.523
That's how he made a lot of his money, with fur trading.

08:58.285 --> 09:01.089
What, I don't want to miss anything here now.

09:02.411 --> 09:09.720
Would you say that, now you did the Rosenbach book, I guess, that was published in 60 or 61.

09:10.055 --> 09:13.819
So, therefore, a lot of that research must have been done in the 50s, I would have to assume.

09:14.100 --> 09:19.846
Well, it was done after Philip Rosenbach's death.

09:19.866 --> 09:27.455
He died in 53, and I started, I guess, the next year or something.

09:27.475 --> 09:38.307
Would you say that there might be some things that I would want to look at that you just didn't have access to on Rosenbach that might be worth my while looking at over there?

09:38.911 --> 09:45.219
I never saw the files in the New York office.

09:46.681 --> 09:52.109
I had to depend on what John told me or the notes he gave me.

09:52.970 --> 09:54.692
Now they've got all those.

09:57.115 --> 09:59.238
Do you think there'd be anything interesting in there?

09:59.258 --> 10:00.600
I have absolutely no.

10:00.660 --> 10:02.142
I'm sure there must be.

10:04.405 --> 10:08.310
But, I mean, there's material that's in them.

10:08.982 --> 10:10.684
It was made available to me.

10:10.904 --> 10:11.185
I see.

10:11.425 --> 10:16.431
But all the other files I went through piece by piece.

10:17.272 --> 10:29.526
Yeah, but I understand now they're having a show, or about to have a show, an exhibit, and they're disclosing for the first time, they say, details of one of his European book buying things.

10:29.546 --> 10:31.849
Yeah, well, that's some of the detail.

10:33.551 --> 10:37.656
In some of the statements that were made in the book,

10:38.024 --> 10:40.967
I relied on other people.

10:41.347 --> 10:43.650
For instance, the Irish trip.

10:43.670 --> 10:52.478
I relied on some of the things that Sean Leslie either wrote or told me, and they weren't quite factual.

10:52.518 --> 10:53.599
They were good stories.

10:54.260 --> 11:03.169
The whole York Minster business about the dean having too much to drink and so forth and so on apparently was nonsense.

11:03.189 --> 11:06.192
But doctor, I heard doctor tell that story.

11:06.644 --> 11:08.026
I don't know how many times.

11:09.467 --> 11:12.671
Yeah, well, I'm on that.

11:12.691 --> 11:12.891
Okay.

11:12.911 --> 11:14.232
The tape is on.

11:14.252 --> 11:16.595
I'm talking to John Van Horne.

11:16.815 --> 11:19.378
You're the director and librarian.

11:19.798 --> 11:25.785
And effectively the director, but the title has been librarian since the early days.

11:26.526 --> 11:26.826
Yeah.

11:27.347 --> 11:35.976
Obviously, Edwin can talk about what I think, just coming in from Boston, you know, the great people and

11:36.344 --> 11:45.254
And Philadelphia book circles, you talk about, he knows Logan as well as anybody alive, and he can talk about Franklin, and he can talk about Rosenbach, and himself.

11:45.354 --> 11:53.903
I mean, tell me a little bit about what he means, what Edwin means to the... I'd like some quotes about Edwin.

11:54.143 --> 11:56.125
Oh, about Edwin, my God.

11:56.145 --> 12:00.310
Well, I mean, he has got to be one of the most...

12:00.678 --> 12:02.601
important people alive, I think.

12:02.621 --> 12:07.128
I think he is, and it's easy to take him for granted because he's such a fixture around here.

12:08.591 --> 12:14.741
But he really is almost responsible for single-handedly bringing the institution around.

12:15.282 --> 12:23.034
And you may have gleaned that from what I sent you, but the library company had really fallen on some pretty hard times.

12:23.054 --> 12:27.782
There was a period when we were actually administered by the Free Library of Philadelphia

12:28.555 --> 12:31.518
Was this because of apathy or crimes or everything?

12:31.858 --> 12:33.800
I'd say both of those things.

12:34.481 --> 12:38.305
It just sort of became a moribund kind of institution.

12:38.365 --> 12:39.326
It was not at all vital.

12:39.406 --> 12:45.251
It was not centrally located or doing things that were important to the city.

12:47.373 --> 12:55.221
Before the advent of the Philadelphia Free Library, you can actually call it the Free Library of Philadelphia, the library company was the public library.

12:55.606 --> 13:02.736
we were the place of first and last resort for most of the city for reading matter and current novels and newspapers and everything.

13:02.756 --> 13:17.237
And when we were at that location on South Broad Street, we always had an uptown branch that people could come to, and it was always much more well attended than the main building, which has always been in a kind of forlorn, out-of-the-way setting.

13:18.959 --> 13:24.988
But after the advent of the Free Library, that function really became sort of redundant.

13:25.458 --> 13:35.411
and it was not necessary for us to offer the kinds of services any longer that the Free Library was able to do, and that was the Free Library's mandate.

13:35.431 --> 13:42.760
And yet we were not a rare book research library, so we sort of fell between the stools.

13:42.780 --> 13:54.435
And because of our location and because of the services that began to be offered by the Free Library, we sort of lost our sense of purpose for a while.

13:54.736 --> 14:05.192
and there were financial problems, and there was apathy, and the institution, as I say, became kind of moribund, and for a while was actually administered by the Free Library.

14:05.412 --> 14:07.075
That has to be the nadir.

14:07.515 --> 14:08.116
It was.

14:08.537 --> 14:10.179
Like somebody else is winning you, you know?

14:10.199 --> 14:15.548
In fact, we have a huge ledger in which we keep membership records, and we record.

14:15.588 --> 14:22.498
It's been kept from the early days that shows who owns what share, and you can trace the descent of shares in families,

14:22.765 --> 14:25.628
Is that still a custom here?

14:25.708 --> 14:27.209
Do you still do that?

14:27.229 --> 14:27.570
We still do it.

14:27.590 --> 14:32.614
If you joined, I would record you in that very book that was begun by— Do you have membership forms out here?

14:32.654 --> 14:33.715
Can I take some with me?

14:34.056 --> 14:34.156
Sure.

14:34.176 --> 14:35.457
We'd love to sign you up.

14:35.477 --> 14:36.878
Is this unique, do you think?

14:36.918 --> 14:38.980
I mean, are there other libraries that do this?

14:39.080 --> 14:41.463
There are other subscription libraries.

14:41.983 --> 14:42.644
I mean, shares.

14:42.844 --> 14:43.625
You buy shares.

14:43.645 --> 14:45.847
Yeah, subscription libraries still use that form.

14:45.967 --> 14:48.329
For instance, the Athenaeum of Philadelphia.

14:48.369 --> 14:50.491
Probably Boston as well, yeah.

14:50.511 --> 14:52.553
But isn't that registered for those years?

14:52.702 --> 15:00.571
when things were so grim, under the column that says librarian, instead of having an individual's name, it said Free Library of Philadelphia.

15:00.651 --> 15:04.035
So these would be the years prior to the 50s, I would say.

15:04.595 --> 15:16.128
And the phrase in one of those booklets that you sent me that was really kind of interesting was that fresh discoveries were being made on a daily basis.

15:17.230 --> 15:17.990
What does that mean?

15:18.211 --> 15:19.812
We didn't know what was here?

15:19.852 --> 15:22.135
We were sitting on a gold mine and we're not aware of it.

15:23.279 --> 15:28.406
nobody really knew what the nature of the collection was or appreciated.

15:28.426 --> 15:32.371
Now, was this stuff that the library had bought or that had been given to them by collectors?

15:33.072 --> 15:36.016
These were things that were... Can you characterize some of it for me?

15:36.036 --> 15:36.356
Sure, yeah.

15:36.376 --> 15:38.239
Because this kind of falls into what I'm writing about.

15:38.259 --> 15:52.257
It's everything we have now, basically, because these would be things that we purchased at the time of publication or that were given to us at the time of publication that were not rare when they were acquired but became rare over the years just by virtue of being in the collection for so long.

15:52.591 --> 15:58.059
or they were things that were given to us by early collectors or librarians.

15:58.079 --> 16:06.030
But these were sort of lost in the mass of material that had been accumulated over the years of sort of current novels.

16:06.951 --> 16:11.578
And the truly rare materials, the real gems, were just sort of lost in the shuffle.

16:12.039 --> 16:21.552
And it was only after Edwin was asked to come in and evaluate the institution and the collection and advise the board on what should become of it that

16:21.835 --> 16:38.278
He realized the extent of our rare materials and recommended that the library company sell, deaccession, all of this fairly modern fiction and other materials.

16:39.019 --> 16:41.623
You took a cutoff date of 1880, I guess you did.

16:41.643 --> 16:43.786
Well, it was earlier, and it's since crept up to 1880.

16:43.806 --> 16:46.510
It was about the Civil War.

16:46.692 --> 17:15.990
become a rare book and research library and don't try to compete with the free library don't try to replicate what they do but in fact recognize the value of what we have that nobody else has so he sharply sharpened the focus very much so and the fresh discoveries were made when he uh just went into the stacks on a daily basis in the process of doing this appraisal and then after after the institution was redefined uh in the process of of trying to catalog it adequately

17:16.392 --> 17:23.382
Edwin, what were some of the fresh discoveries, the most exciting discoveries that you made when you were going through that?

17:24.724 --> 17:45.994
Well, I would say the book that always makes my hair stand on end is the copy of The History of Louisiana that was borrowed from Benjamin Smith Barton and returned by Meriwether Lewis with a thing

17:46.430 --> 17:50.355
I have taken this with me on my late trip across the continent.

17:50.415 --> 17:52.037
Wow.

17:52.057 --> 17:52.918
You found that here.

17:53.118 --> 17:53.839
Found that, yes.

17:53.859 --> 17:56.762
Could you describe that, how that happened, how you found it?

17:57.483 --> 17:58.805
Well, I opened up the book.

17:59.165 --> 18:02.089
I mean, probably for the first time in a hundred years.

18:02.109 --> 18:03.951
I'm just thinking you were going through the basement.

18:03.971 --> 18:06.514
Were we in the basement?

18:06.534 --> 18:06.774
Well, no.

18:06.854 --> 18:15.745
When I started, every book, every book that was recatalogued, I handled.

18:16.501 --> 18:19.865
But these were things that were basically in the, just the open shelving.

18:19.885 --> 18:27.935
They were in the collection, and we kept pulling books and recataloging them, and putting them.

18:28.515 --> 18:32.120
We built steel shelves in one room, and so forth and so on.

18:32.740 --> 18:39.268
And in the course of looking at it, right in the front was this inscription.

18:39.535 --> 18:56.061
Did you ever marvel at the number of important things like that, that were still on the shelves after all of these years of turmoil and neglect, that they hadn't been... Well, I guess... Yes, I guess there's some things that have gone.

18:57.604 --> 19:06.117
There's a statement in the catalog, an entry in the catalog, that in the Mackenzie collection,

19:06.721 --> 19:13.147
was a complete run of the Poor Richard Almanacs from 1733 on to 1757-58.

19:13.207 --> 19:18.272
We don't have one now.

19:18.292 --> 19:20.234
And there are only two copies.

19:20.374 --> 19:23.197
Oh, yes, we don't have a complete run.

19:23.978 --> 19:28.983
There are only two copies known of the 1733 Almanac.

19:29.003 --> 19:30.524
Where are they?

19:30.885 --> 19:35.209
One's at Rosenbach and one's at the Historical Society.

19:35.932 --> 19:39.015
Neither of those can have been this one.

19:40.236 --> 19:40.897
So what do you think?

19:40.957 --> 19:42.118
What do you suspect?

19:42.138 --> 19:48.204
Well, I don't know what happens with books that are abstracted.

19:48.884 --> 19:52.648
I mean, you just don't know.

19:52.688 --> 20:05.280
It's possible, I suppose, that somewhere, someplace, in somebody's old trunk, it's there.

20:05.513 --> 20:08.135
Be grateful for what you preserve, though, I suppose.

20:08.155 --> 20:08.696
Who knows?

20:08.716 --> 20:16.923
Well, John Lanham, the account of the Athenaeum in Boston, says they're just certain that at some point they had a Tamerlane in the building.

20:18.345 --> 20:23.670
Because the people who printed it or published it were affiliated with the Athenaeum.

20:23.690 --> 20:26.933
So they had to have had a copy in-house.

20:26.953 --> 20:28.354
And so what happened?

20:29.395 --> 20:33.799
Well, you might have had one here, too, for all you know.

20:34.690 --> 20:36.393
Less likely, but possible.

20:36.413 --> 20:37.054
Less likely.

20:37.294 --> 20:54.561
Well, it's possible, because two of the major books of American literature the library company bought when they first came out, Moby Dick and Leaves of Grass.

20:54.581 --> 20:54.942
Very nice.

20:55.282 --> 20:58.167
And both of those were

20:59.378 --> 21:01.823
underestimated books at the time.

21:02.143 --> 21:05.570
Well, Moby Dick wasn't rediscovered until the 1920s.

21:05.590 --> 21:09.097
1920, until they found Billy Budd in the trunk.

21:09.839 --> 21:12.203
That's what happened, and the re-evaluation started.

21:12.544 --> 21:17.754
And the first edition of that is so scarce, because it didn't sell, and Harper's had a fire.

21:18.175 --> 21:20.239
So most of the first printings got destroyed.

21:20.641 --> 21:24.766
I mean, so Moby Dick, I think the true first of that is English, actually.

21:24.786 --> 21:25.767
That's right, the whale.

21:26.147 --> 21:27.109
That's right, yeah.

21:27.529 --> 21:42.126
So that, those were, you didn't buy a, uh, Mark McCorrison tells a wonderful story about how Audubon, when he was, you know, doing the book, he came through Worcester and, and, uh, he came, he had two days trying to sell him a copy of the book, but they were too busy to see him.

21:42.899 --> 21:45.162
So they never, you know, they didn't get it.

21:45.843 --> 21:49.287
And Reich says he was just another bookseller at the time.

21:49.467 --> 22:06.810
We didn't buy, we didn't buy a copy of Audubon, but we did buy a copy of Muybridge's whole great big thing, the human form in motion, or the animal in motion, rather.

22:08.512 --> 22:10.054
Did we pretty much cover Logan?

22:10.321 --> 22:11.122
I think so.

22:11.203 --> 22:12.926
Tell me when we have to wrap up, by the way.

22:13.086 --> 22:17.113
I'm going off in about 10 minutes.

22:17.293 --> 22:18.896
How long do you have today?

22:19.337 --> 22:21.882
I'm going to go over to the Rosenbach at about 2.

22:22.743 --> 22:27.672
I'm going to see Ellen Dunlap over there.

22:28.310 --> 22:30.533
Green can spend some time with you if you like.

22:30.673 --> 22:32.515
I don't know if you have plans for lunch.

22:32.756 --> 22:34.918
I can call you back at some point, too.

22:35.119 --> 22:37.822
I thought I might just run over to see a couple of these bookstores here.

22:38.443 --> 22:39.764
The mountain's right down the street.

22:39.864 --> 22:40.906
The mountain's right down the street.

22:40.986 --> 22:43.209
And is McManus around here, too?

22:43.229 --> 22:45.732
He's right behind us on the next street.

22:45.952 --> 22:47.794
I really want to use every minute I've got here.

22:47.834 --> 22:50.538
Yeah.

22:50.558 --> 22:50.658
Okay.

22:50.678 --> 22:50.958
Excuse me.

22:50.978 --> 22:53.822
I have one or two other important... Oh, incidentally.

22:53.942 --> 22:57.727
You asked me a question that I think Mary and I could answer.

22:57.747 --> 22:57.827
Yes.

22:58.246 --> 23:01.029
which is why Arthur Houghton sold his books.

23:01.690 --> 23:02.191
She'd know.

23:02.371 --> 23:06.576
They were very close friends, the Hydes and Arthur.

23:06.596 --> 23:07.357
Do you think she'll know?

23:07.678 --> 23:08.659
Do you think anybody knows?

23:09.059 --> 23:11.162
Well, I'd ask her.

23:11.182 --> 23:12.283
She's your best bet.

23:13.304 --> 23:14.666
That's an interesting question, isn't it?

23:14.926 --> 23:16.348
Yes, it is.

23:17.550 --> 23:18.811
Anything on Benjamin Franklin?

23:18.831 --> 23:21.334
We were talking about Franklin writing the obit for Logan.

23:21.555 --> 23:24.338
I was thinking that might be a nice way to open that chapter.

23:24.942 --> 23:29.470
one bookman paying tribute to it, one great bookman paying tribute to another.

23:29.791 --> 23:31.794
Was Franklin a great bookman, by the way?

23:31.814 --> 23:32.696
Can we make that statement?

23:32.716 --> 23:33.998
Oh, yes, I'd say that.

23:34.018 --> 23:37.525
This is really a creation of his, isn't that correct?

23:37.545 --> 23:38.887
That's right.

23:38.947 --> 23:41.952
So Philadelphia really has this, I guess, when we were done.

23:41.972 --> 23:44.156
Of course, he didn't see it as a rare book library.

23:46.080 --> 23:47.923
Or a research library, indeed.

23:48.644 --> 23:49.566
But the book has...

23:49.934 --> 23:53.118
It's more than just something to covet.

23:53.138 --> 23:57.264
As you said about Logan, he could care less about weary, scarcity, and value.

23:57.324 --> 24:00.349
It was a good book, the best available edition.

24:01.110 --> 24:09.742
And Franklin was more interested in the utility of making a collection that would be available for years more than anything else.

24:09.762 --> 24:12.786
I want you to, this is very important to me, Lessing Rosenwald.

24:13.667 --> 24:16.872
A very interesting person.

24:18.033 --> 24:18.574
I think

24:19.381 --> 24:36.816
I'm thinking of starting a chapter where, quoting him in his recollections of a collector, where he says, the only time he ever gave the doctor to go ahead, a blank check, to buy anything, was to buy something, in essence, that he detested, which was this

24:37.167 --> 24:42.836
This thing that the Nazis wanted, the Simon of Trent.

24:42.856 --> 24:45.901
Which the American Jewish historians sold.

24:45.921 --> 24:47.042
$467,000.

24:47.203 --> 24:48.885
Outrageous.

24:49.126 --> 24:49.666
Outrageous.

24:50.007 --> 25:00.964
But it is interesting that Rosenwald, this is an interesting side to the collector, to collect something that you detest, that is so untrushional that you don't even want to put it in your own collection.

25:01.248 --> 25:03.210
But you feel, why not just destroy it?

25:03.871 --> 25:14.001
Well, he wanted to keep it where it would be safe and not used for anti-Semitic purposes.

25:14.401 --> 25:17.164
And the Nazis were the underbidder, apparently, on that.

25:17.184 --> 25:17.865
Apparently.

25:17.985 --> 25:19.727
And they tried to open up the sale again.

25:20.087 --> 25:29.677
Then he gave it to the American Jewish Historical Society in Massachusetts, which in 86, one would expect that they would keep it.

25:30.377 --> 25:31.018
They sold it.

25:31.572 --> 25:32.273
to pay the rent.

25:32.894 --> 25:33.374
Absolutely.

25:33.895 --> 25:36.979
How would you feel if you were one of Rosenwald's heirs?

25:36.999 --> 25:42.847
Well, I asked them, and they... Well, they wound up at Yeshiva, so it's in a good place.

25:43.868 --> 25:44.950
But that's not the point.

25:45.270 --> 25:56.565
I think that when you do something like that... No, I thought it was outrageous, and I tried to get them excited about it, but they weren't excited.

25:57.206 --> 26:00.550
I'd say that most gifts that come in do not have explicit...

26:00.985 --> 26:09.191
stipulations that they could never be alienated, but it's just a practice to honor them.

26:09.211 --> 26:13.223
Well, no, this was a very special...

26:14.215 --> 26:17.679
He said this is the only time he gave the doctor a blank check.

26:17.959 --> 26:23.205
I mean, in other words, when he bought his Gutenberg Bible, he had limits.

26:23.425 --> 26:26.909
When he bought all these extraordinary things, he had limits, but there were no limits.

26:26.929 --> 26:28.812
As it turned out, he only paid about $4,000.

26:29.472 --> 26:34.718
Maybe he was talking a little bit.

26:36.160 --> 26:42.467
But I love the story in your book where he also is the one responsible for the doctor

26:43.223 --> 26:45.346
returning the Alice.

26:45.366 --> 26:46.548
Yes, it's true.

26:47.629 --> 26:49.912
So Lessing kind of had this sense, I guess.

26:50.373 --> 26:54.719
That that's where it belonged, back in the British Library.

26:56.822 --> 26:58.865
There's something interesting about Lessing.

26:59.286 --> 27:06.075
You know, he had a Morocco or half-Morocco case made for every single book that he bought.

27:09.093 --> 27:14.119
The only person I know who ever did that, and the only collector.

27:14.140 --> 27:18.665
So that he never had any old bindings on his shelves.

27:19.326 --> 27:22.991
So he had the best of all the possible worlds.

27:23.211 --> 27:24.233
They weren't uniform.

27:24.253 --> 27:31.402
They were different colors and different sizes, but they were not the old bindings.

27:31.582 --> 27:33.364
Maybe he loved these Morocco pieces.

27:33.384 --> 27:36.088
No, he... Maybe there was a collection in his own words.

27:36.108 --> 27:37.750
No, it was a matter of...

27:38.084 --> 27:38.865
preservation.

27:38.905 --> 27:41.807
He thought that was the best way to keep them.

27:41.947 --> 27:44.109
Did they travel with the books when he gave them away?

27:44.149 --> 27:45.190
Oh yes, of course.

27:46.471 --> 27:46.812
Of course.

27:48.713 --> 27:53.598
But I always thought that was an unusual quirk.

27:54.478 --> 28:05.668
Now, if you do it for books that are in bindings that are in bad condition, or bindings that he bought qua bindings, that's one thing, but everything.

28:06.409 --> 28:07.770
I've heard it suggested that he

28:08.510 --> 28:13.475
He actually got a good tax break from the government.

28:13.495 --> 28:19.120
I can't tell you where I heard this, because it's just nothing documented.

28:19.140 --> 28:25.125
But when he gave all this great collection to the country, in return he didn't have to pay income taxes.

28:25.646 --> 28:26.967
Have you ever heard anything like that?

28:27.007 --> 28:28.749
No, but I would guess he had.

28:28.769 --> 28:30.670
The usual write-off of the value?

28:30.731 --> 28:31.251
That's right.

28:32.112 --> 28:34.034
I think it may have been.

28:36.015 --> 28:37.757
Well, he gave it in chunks.

28:38.395 --> 28:39.557
I mean, he didn't give it all.

28:39.677 --> 28:40.619
Well, look what they got, too.

28:40.739 --> 28:41.441
I mean, why not?

28:41.761 --> 28:47.873
Presumably each chunk was of enough value to offset all of his income for that year.

28:49.095 --> 28:58.834
Which is, you know, that's one of the reasons that institutions claim today that the private collector is the big deal again, because all of a sudden it's not attractive.

28:59.371 --> 29:01.493
for me to give my collection to an institution.

29:01.513 --> 29:04.797
I'm not getting any kind of a tax write-off with the tax repayment.

29:04.857 --> 29:06.038
That's who you are.

29:06.158 --> 29:07.400
Oh, yes, you are.

29:07.420 --> 29:09.322
Well, I hope I'm getting a tax write-off.

29:10.343 --> 29:10.603
Indeed.

29:11.544 --> 29:11.864
What?

29:12.365 --> 29:14.828
Does he want to wrap up now?

29:14.928 --> 29:15.268
I'm sorry?

29:15.408 --> 29:15.728
No, no.

29:15.749 --> 29:17.310
Oh, I thought he said a taxi write.

29:17.370 --> 29:17.911
No, no.

29:17.951 --> 29:18.572
Tax write-off.

29:18.732 --> 29:20.213
For those.

29:20.233 --> 29:20.714
I'm sorry.

29:21.495 --> 29:25.459
What do you think of Edwin's collection over there?

29:25.479 --> 29:26.420
It's fabulous.

29:27.181 --> 29:27.641
We're delighted.

29:27.661 --> 29:28.382
We're delighted to have it.

29:28.835 --> 29:31.059
Does it have a special name?

29:31.920 --> 29:41.557
Well, I guess it's the Wolf Collection, at least informally, but we decided to house it here, sort of on permanent public display in the Logan Room, and keep it together.

29:41.698 --> 29:49.592
The Wolf Collection of 18th century books most likely to be found in the Colonial American Library.

29:49.652 --> 29:52.517
And how do you feel sitting here looking at that in a Logan Room?

29:52.938 --> 29:53.779
I think it's fine.

29:55.345 --> 30:06.825
Normally, even though we would know which books constitute a particular gift or collection, everything would be individually accessioned and then broken up and shelved in the appropriate part of the stacks.

30:06.845 --> 30:13.396
And so this is about the only instance where we can actually keep the collection intact and housed together.

30:14.598 --> 30:21.049
And Jim Green thinks it looks better than does.

30:22.750 --> 30:25.453
You know David Redden at Sotheby's in New York?

30:26.555 --> 30:31.761
He believes that we are now in a new golden age of American book collecting.

30:31.781 --> 30:32.362
What do you think?

30:32.562 --> 30:32.982
He should.

30:34.524 --> 30:35.966
He means prices.

30:36.106 --> 30:39.170
Well, yeah, he's saying, well, there are things available.

30:40.091 --> 30:41.513
I should send you a copy of this story.

30:41.553 --> 30:49.402
He said, if you had $100 million, you could build one of the finest libraries ever put together.

30:49.543 --> 30:50.283
That's not true.

30:51.024 --> 30:52.386
That's my question for you.

30:53.682 --> 31:01.039
I think what he means is that prices are now at such a level that institutions can't hope to compete.

31:01.179 --> 31:03.405
No, he means two things, because I pursued the point with him.

31:03.485 --> 31:05.329
He means that's number one.

31:05.562 --> 31:12.070
But number two is that people now know the market, and things that they never thought they would see sold again are being sold again.

31:12.090 --> 31:15.214
Well, yeah, but it's because the great private libraries are being broken up.

31:15.274 --> 31:17.897
Like Bradley Martin's, for instance, and Doheny's.

31:18.137 --> 31:28.149
But instead of going into institutions, they're just being reconstituted into other private libraries so that ultimately, I suppose, in another generation, we'll see the same books come up for sale again.

31:28.249 --> 31:31.333
But I'm interested in why you say it's not true.

31:31.353 --> 31:35.518
You show me, or let anybody show me, where you can gather.

31:35.870 --> 31:38.733
A respectable collection of Shakespeare quartos.

31:39.714 --> 31:46.502
I mean, just to give you one instance, a respectable collection of Blake.

31:46.522 --> 31:51.689
One or two, yes, sure, they're always the odd ones, but I'm talking about a collection now.

31:52.289 --> 31:59.117
You can't collect Blake, and you can't collect Shakespeare quartos.

31:59.137 --> 32:01.540
I don't care who says what.

32:01.925 --> 32:04.990
Or Richard's Almanacs, either.

32:05.010 --> 32:05.430
That's right.

32:05.450 --> 32:06.272
Or Richard's Almanacs.

32:08.635 --> 32:08.735
Yeah.

32:08.755 --> 32:12.200
I don't think it's possible for a collector today to buy the way Henry Huntington did.

32:12.701 --> 32:18.870
In seven years, with unlimited wealth, put together, you know, one of the finest collections in the world.

32:18.891 --> 32:20.793
Because he would buy entire libraries.

32:20.813 --> 32:21.274
That's right.

32:21.294 --> 32:22.296
He bought en bloc.

32:22.536 --> 32:22.977
En bloc.

32:23.497 --> 32:31.189
And now, and also, you see, once upon a time, the last upheaval in

32:31.490 --> 32:47.212
Europe after World War I. You had institutional libraries that came on the market, and like the couple Gutenberg Bibles were sold at that time.

32:48.514 --> 32:56.866
The Russians sold the famous Codex at that time, Codex Sinaiticus.

32:57.647 --> 32:58.628
I mean, those things

32:59.131 --> 33:01.854
The Russians aren't going to start selling books off.

33:02.495 --> 33:08.442
The German libraries aren't going to be allowed to get rid of their best things.

33:09.523 --> 33:13.027
I mean, it just won't happen that way.

33:13.548 --> 33:16.912
The Golden Age, then, is in the past, as far as you're concerned.

33:18.614 --> 33:21.077
For some things.

33:21.817 --> 33:22.638
I mean, it depends.

33:22.698 --> 33:24.941
You talk about golden books.

33:24.961 --> 33:26.623
Well, what are the golden books?

33:27.143 --> 33:29.586
of the next century going to be.

33:30.487 --> 33:31.529
They're not going to be these.

33:31.609 --> 33:32.910
They're going to be something else.

33:32.970 --> 33:35.293
Well, that goes back to something you said earlier.

33:35.674 --> 33:40.520
One thing that you like to do as a collector is to collect something that nobody else does.

33:40.540 --> 33:44.706
Is to identify something that nobody else is doing.

33:44.826 --> 33:49.051
Somebody right now must be putting together a collection on AIDS research.

33:49.452 --> 33:51.995
You know, the first time the word was ever used, for instance.

33:52.055 --> 33:54.338
You know, I mean, there are people who do medical things.

33:54.358 --> 33:56.020
There are people who do any kind of different things.

33:56.287 --> 33:57.849
I would just, I just throw that out.

33:57.889 --> 33:59.150
There will be new classics.

33:59.730 --> 34:00.171
There will be.

34:00.191 --> 34:04.275
There are one hopes, as long as there's a human intellect.

34:04.515 --> 34:05.396
No doubt about it.

34:05.716 --> 34:15.005
Somebody, I forget, I read it somewhere, somebody has been very busy making a collection of computer literature.

34:15.025 --> 34:16.126
Oh, that's right.

34:16.146 --> 34:19.450
Yeah, I'm afraid I'd have to... We can always talk again on the phone.

34:19.470 --> 34:20.150
Yes, please call me.

34:20.230 --> 34:24.134
Are there some... Can I grab some part of those little handouts and things?

34:24.154 --> 34:24.334
Oh, sure.

34:24.354 --> 34:25.956
There's a little brochure at the front desk.

34:26.223 --> 34:33.294
If you ever see anything that I could use, appreciate it.

34:33.334 --> 34:34.275
Now we'll be in touch.

34:34.896 --> 34:35.537
Thanks very much.

34:36.639 --> 34:36.999
Thanks for coming.

34:37.019 --> 34:38.361
Do you want to wrap it up?

34:38.401 --> 34:55.707
Yeah, unless you've got... Let me just shut this off for a second and just a little bit more about the doctor, Dr. Rosenbach, and where you did mention in your book where Smith's death helped the doctor become the major league.

34:56.108 --> 35:00.735
That is one of those things, a circumstance, I guess.

35:00.755 --> 35:03.880
Tim, what do you remember most about Rosenbach?

35:05.462 --> 35:08.066
When I say his name, who do you see, what do you see?

35:08.387 --> 35:10.329
He was a master of public relations, certainly.

35:10.430 --> 35:20.805
Well, he was a master of public relations, but he did have an appealing personality, and that was part of the game.

35:21.546 --> 35:25.272
Now, granted, the personality is, I think, I made

35:25.842 --> 35:54.685
perfectly clear, was an alcohol-fueled persona, but it was warm, it was interesting, he was informed, and anybody who was collecting, Lessing Rosenwald is a good example, listened to the doctor.

35:55.272 --> 35:57.335
as though the doctor were a prophet.

35:58.077 --> 35:59.880
Well, in many ways, he was.

36:00.561 --> 36:02.224
That's what he would say, listen to the doctor?

36:02.284 --> 36:02.784
Yeah.

36:03.946 --> 36:09.556
He was prophesying that these are great books and they'll be better.

36:10.317 --> 36:17.028
I mean, everybody thought he was crazy when he once said, Gutenberg Bible will sell for $100,000 someday.

36:18.090 --> 36:19.192
Whoever would have guessed.

36:19.693 --> 36:20.554
I mean, you know.

36:21.158 --> 36:22.359
Lita Solis Cohen.

36:22.399 --> 36:22.940
You know Lita?

36:23.080 --> 36:23.801
Oh, of course.

36:23.821 --> 36:27.444
I did a piece for Main Antiques Digest for her.

36:27.524 --> 36:39.376
She said that somebody at an auction house told her that the going phrase for the 90s is, whatever you paid for it in the 80s, put another zero after it for the 90s.

36:39.456 --> 36:42.378
Isn't that an interesting rule of thumb?

36:42.398 --> 36:45.902
Yes, but you know, there are still cheap things.

36:47.363 --> 36:48.164
There are some things.

36:48.184 --> 36:49.225
And opportunities.

36:49.694 --> 37:12.914
There's some things that have not gone up in price, the way Gutenberg bought... Well, we're talking high spots, you know, but for instance... Well, if somebody really started collecting American revolutionary pamphlets, for instance, the prices they're going for aren't tremendous.

37:12.974 --> 37:18.739
You get one like Payne's Common Sense, yes.

37:19.124 --> 37:39.960
five-star book, but run-of-the-mill things haven't accelerated in price, and somebody with comparatively modest needs, willing to pay three, four, five hundred dollars for a book, can buy them.

37:41.503 --> 37:44.288
What is it about, maybe we can wrap it up,

37:44.521 --> 37:50.010
Do you have any insight on the psychology of a bibliophile, a bibliomaniac?

37:50.030 --> 37:50.390
Of what?

37:50.871 --> 38:07.037
The psychology of a person who would spend... No, I just don't understand why somebody wants something that badly.

38:07.077 --> 38:12.385
I mean, I find it difficult to believe that they are

38:13.276 --> 38:16.900
dedicated bookmen.

38:17.100 --> 38:26.230
I may be doing them, be most unfair, but I just don't see Mr. Forbes.

38:27.232 --> 38:31.436
He's dismissed by everybody so far as I can tell.

38:31.616 --> 38:36.982
As a bookman or a collector, I see him as making headlines.

38:38.324 --> 38:39.285
Well, there's a dealer.

38:39.625 --> 38:42.068
I'll shut this off.

38:43.651 --> 38:48.495
So you would not describe yourself, then, as a bibliomaniac in any way?

38:49.116 --> 38:50.637
Oh, I'm not a bibliomaniac.

38:50.677 --> 38:51.979
I think I know what I'm doing.

38:53.880 --> 39:00.646
You see, the maniacal part of it is spending money without knowing why.

39:01.727 --> 39:09.114
But you certainly get a feeling that you probably can't describe when you pick something up that's wonderful.

39:10.275 --> 39:10.575
Well, yes.

39:10.876 --> 39:12.257
I mean, sure.

39:12.608 --> 39:22.959
I'd love to have a Gutenberg Bible of my own, but, you know, it doesn't make any sense.

39:24.781 --> 39:31.228
So I'd collect American Victorian bindings, you see.

39:31.288 --> 39:41.940
And what's happened is, when I started, I was getting them by the carton from dealers.

39:43.085 --> 39:48.131
You know, so much a piece, but if you take them all, you can have them for that.

39:49.673 --> 39:52.616
And that's all dried up.

39:53.457 --> 39:58.103
Let's just take one fast look through the notes here, and we can wrap it up.

39:58.143 --> 40:00.486
Bill Targ was your editor, I gather, by the way.

40:00.706 --> 40:01.146
Right.

40:01.487 --> 40:05.852
Well, Bill Targ was the promoter, not the editor.

40:07.587 --> 40:10.451
But he's still around, I guess, isn't he?

40:10.491 --> 40:12.553
He might be an interesting person to talk to.

40:13.134 --> 40:19.041
Well, he was in the book world quite early in Chicago.

40:20.643 --> 40:24.088
Bill, yeah, I would think he's a good person to talk to.

40:25.910 --> 40:27.151
We talked about Rosenwald.

40:27.171 --> 40:32.959
We talked about Rosenbach.

40:32.979 --> 40:34.120
Dr. Houghton, Motivation.

40:34.160 --> 40:36.463
We talked about all those things, catalogs.

40:36.629 --> 40:39.113
Just checking off my areas here.

40:41.276 --> 40:43.980
Martin Bodmer was the name you mentioned as well.

40:44.060 --> 40:50.229
Yeah, well, I didn't know Martin Bodmer, but he too sold books, you know.

40:51.210 --> 40:54.956
Now, that's a... Would you do me the honors and subscribe this?

40:55.437 --> 40:57.239
Now, you'll have to give me your cards.

40:58.141 --> 40:59.663
I'm sorry, the what?

40:59.683 --> 41:01.165
The collector's approved books.

41:01.185 --> 41:01.986
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

41:02.026 --> 41:04.230
People spend a lot of money for these things.

41:04.250 --> 41:04.510
That's right.

41:05.536 --> 41:07.438
I collect them as they come my way.

41:08.078 --> 41:09.480
That's kind of how I define that.

41:10.140 --> 41:14.705
I think I've got plenty of stuff, and anything I don't have, I can always call you.

41:14.945 --> 41:15.366
Okay.

41:16.847 --> 41:19.630
Because this has been great, and I don't want to overextend my welcome.

41:19.650 --> 41:20.951
Well, fine.

41:21.251 --> 41:24.094
Thank you very much.

41:24.354 --> 41:30.240
I'll ask you about most of the things about Lou Feldman.

41:30.260 --> 41:32.562
I would say he was a great play actor.

41:34.644 --> 41:35.425
I don't know.

41:36.367 --> 41:37.529
He was a good promoter.

41:37.849 --> 41:43.717
He apparently was a good salesman because he sold Texas all kinds of things.

41:43.797 --> 41:45.439
He had an exclusive angle with him.

41:45.459 --> 41:46.381
How did he work that?

41:46.461 --> 41:47.462
I have no idea.

41:48.664 --> 42:04.365
Lou Feldman once called me and said he wanted to take a look at a library of Americana and he really didn't know anything at all about

42:04.919 --> 42:12.230
Americana, and would I go with him and give him the benefit of my advice?

42:13.272 --> 42:26.332
So we went up, what the heck was the very famous library, went up to Saco, Maine, and spent the day.

42:26.352 --> 42:27.714
The library was in Maine?

42:28.495 --> 42:32.361
Deering was the library, D-E-E.

42:33.067 --> 42:33.948
R.I.N.C.

42:33.968 --> 42:35.049
was the library.

42:37.571 --> 42:46.680
Good Steves had already looked at it, and had made an offer that was not acceptable to Mr. Deary.

42:48.882 --> 43:02.635
We went up, and I looked at it, and I said, this is a library that needs an awful lot of looking into, because there's a certain amount of imperfection and some

43:03.070 --> 43:05.173
facsimile title pages.

43:05.694 --> 43:09.218
But all in all, it's a fabulous library.

43:09.299 --> 43:17.710
I said I couldn't begin to guess what you do until you had a pretty damn good catalog of it.

43:18.411 --> 43:22.717
Well, it was eventually sold to Newbury.

43:23.518 --> 43:24.179
Chicago.

43:24.199 --> 43:25.060
In Chicago.

43:26.362 --> 43:31.609
And I became very friendly with Mr. Deerick.

43:32.112 --> 43:36.017
He did not like Lou Feldman, period.

43:37.218 --> 43:41.404
But every Christmas he had a daughter who lived down here.

43:41.424 --> 43:50.735
Every Christmas he used to come down, stop in at Broad and Christian Street, and we'd go out to lunch and have a couple of martinis.

43:50.755 --> 43:53.559
But this was for a couple of years after that.

43:55.121 --> 43:57.183
So he was an interesting character, though, I guess.

43:57.203 --> 44:00.988
Well, he was an interesting character, but... I heard somebody say...

44:01.778 --> 44:06.004
and I won't identify the person, but had some relationship with Texas.

44:06.104 --> 44:08.147
I hope he took his secrets to the grave with them.

44:08.828 --> 44:11.832
Well, one wonders.

44:11.892 --> 44:19.403
I guess he would sell stuff to Texas at a higher price, but he'd wait for two or three years for the money to catch up.

44:20.604 --> 44:21.626
Have you heard those stories?

44:23.148 --> 44:23.248
Yeah.

44:23.268 --> 44:30.418
I was in his place when he had in a huge chest

44:31.259 --> 44:34.383
Tennessee Williams manuscripts.

44:34.403 --> 44:35.744
Do they have that down in Texas?

44:35.845 --> 44:37.226
I don't know what happened to it.

44:37.266 --> 44:37.827
Yeah, they do.

44:37.927 --> 44:42.292
They claim to have the preeminent Tennessee Williams collection.

44:42.373 --> 44:44.295
Well, I saw it.

44:44.375 --> 44:49.802
And I had a delightful day with Dave Kirchenbaum, and could you give me a couple quotes on Dave?

44:49.822 --> 44:54.808
Dave said, just, if you don't much about him, he's just a wonderful man, it seems to me.

44:54.968 --> 44:57.251
Yeah, Dave was fine.

44:57.271 --> 45:00.034
He's always been very friendly to me.

45:00.757 --> 45:05.001
The trade doesn't like Dave Feldman.

45:05.021 --> 45:05.582
Why is that?

45:06.743 --> 45:11.107
I think because he was too close to some of the auctioneers.

45:12.708 --> 45:16.952
Well, he told me that he pushed John Marion around in his baby carriage.

45:17.313 --> 45:22.057
He and Lou Marion, I guess his father, were very friendly.

45:22.377 --> 45:27.422
I have been told that I don't know this as a fact, and had no reason to

45:29.275 --> 45:38.425
I have no reason to believe it, that he was denied membership in the American Antiquarian Bookman Association now.

45:39.606 --> 45:40.807
He's not in it, I know that.

45:40.847 --> 45:41.628
He's not in it.

45:41.648 --> 45:42.009
Yeah.

45:42.910 --> 45:45.512
And I have no idea why.

45:45.532 --> 45:46.734
I wonder why.

45:46.754 --> 45:50.298
Well, that must be a story that... Like Graham Morater, isn't it?

45:50.318 --> 45:54.142
Graham Morater was kicked out.

45:54.462 --> 45:56.144
He was kicked out.

45:56.164 --> 45:59.147
That I can understand a little better.

45:59.482 --> 46:10.414
But I must say, Dave has never been anything but nice to me, and I like him.

46:10.795 --> 46:16.281
Gosh, he is, you know, one of the few old-time bookmen left.

46:16.361 --> 46:24.090
He can talk about, he was at the wholesale, he says, in 1912, and he said he has not missed a major sale since then.

46:24.850 --> 46:25.631
I can believe that.

46:25.671 --> 46:26.112
That's amazing.

46:26.753 --> 46:28.915
I can believe that.

46:29.165 --> 46:30.226
He knew John Quinn.

46:30.246 --> 46:32.369
He didn't care much for Quinn.

46:32.449 --> 46:33.410
Did you know Quinn at all?

46:33.470 --> 46:34.712
No, I didn't know Quinn.

46:34.732 --> 46:35.994
That's before my time.

46:37.035 --> 46:44.104
But that wasn't... He knew Kennerly, Rachel Kennerly.

46:44.344 --> 46:47.989
He was very friendly with John Fleming.

46:48.409 --> 46:48.730
He was.

46:49.350 --> 46:50.832
He mentioned John, and I would do his matter.

46:50.852 --> 46:54.717
He was very friendly with John Fleming.

46:57.177 --> 46:59.239
He just seems to have been there, though.

46:59.259 --> 47:07.667
I mean, he claims to have had lunch with Bradley Martin three days a week, you know, and I guess he... Probably.

47:07.727 --> 47:14.573
Why would, now just, not speaking just about Dave, but why would dealers not like the fact that he knew auctioneers?

47:14.673 --> 47:16.134
Well, I don't know.

47:16.355 --> 47:23.601
Unless you've got deals, you know, it depends.

47:24.382 --> 47:25.463
Some...

47:25.780 --> 47:32.187
I know so little about this that it's difficult for me to say anything.

47:32.287 --> 47:33.489
Did you ever buy at auctions?

47:33.729 --> 47:34.049
Sure.

47:35.050 --> 47:38.094
Yourself, or did you send agents?

47:38.174 --> 47:38.714
Both ways.

47:41.518 --> 47:46.163
I gather you've made your most satisfying discoveries, though, in places outside of the auction.

47:46.503 --> 47:46.964
That's right.

47:47.704 --> 47:50.287
Things that you just kind of discovered.

47:50.307 --> 47:54.572
Can you give me an anecdote of one of your most exciting discoveries?

47:55.295 --> 48:00.642
I just gave a talk in which I said I really never had an exciting discovery.

48:01.443 --> 48:01.924
Why is that?

48:03.246 --> 48:03.746
I don't know.

48:03.867 --> 48:05.829
I never found a Tamerlane.

48:06.470 --> 48:11.817
I found Emily Dickinson's first book of poems for five dollars in a garage.

48:11.837 --> 48:22.592
Well, you see, in hindsight, some of the things, some of those things are fine, but they're not exciting discoveries.

48:23.773 --> 48:25.015
Today they look cheap.

48:25.400 --> 48:26.141
but that's all.

48:28.203 --> 48:30.745
I just can't believe you haven't made an exciting discussion.

48:30.765 --> 48:31.446
No, no.

48:31.466 --> 48:32.227
What's your biggest decision?

48:32.307 --> 48:51.626
All my, all my, the books I bought for myself, the things that I bought for the library company when I first came, unbelievably cheap, but the duplicates that I sold to get that money were sold unbelievably cheap.

48:52.107 --> 48:52.788
So, you know.

48:52.808 --> 48:55.170
I got plenty of stuff here.

48:57.125 --> 48:57.806
Go ahead.

48:57.826 --> 48:58.627
Show Fox.

48:58.647 --> 48:59.388
We're talking about it.

49:00.430 --> 49:11.846
Logan Fox, his name is William Logan Fox, known as Logan, was one of the great, crusty, old Philadelphians.

49:11.866 --> 49:14.209
And everybody respected him.

49:15.671 --> 49:24.263
Most of the people were always slightly scared of him, and my relationship with Logan Fox

49:24.580 --> 49:31.167
who was the Rosenbach's landlord, which is why he knew me.

49:32.007 --> 49:38.874
And when I left Rosenbach's, he is the one who suggested I come take a look at the library company.

49:41.917 --> 49:51.567
Logan Fox, not long after I came to the library company, would look at all the bills

49:52.728 --> 50:00.657
sign all the checks, he was the treasurer, and speak to me on the telephone two or three times a week.

50:01.878 --> 50:15.834
And I was on the telephone, this was maybe about a month after I came, and he said, young man, I want to tell you something.

50:15.854 --> 50:18.617
And through my head I wondered, mind

50:20.690 --> 50:22.211
I wonder what I've done wrong.

50:22.231 --> 50:25.374
I mean, he had that kind of thing.

50:25.394 --> 50:29.858
He said, young man, I'm not Mr. Fox, I'm Logan.

50:30.319 --> 50:33.622
That's a great story.

50:34.242 --> 50:39.147
Joe says he's got a pretty, it sounds like he has a pretty interesting collection and stuff that he inherited, I guess.

50:39.427 --> 50:41.449
Well, Joe has what's left.

50:41.629 --> 50:43.411
I got an awful lot of it.

50:43.431 --> 50:44.632
You mentioned that, yeah.

50:44.652 --> 50:46.814
Yeah, I'm, he's given the cream.

50:46.874 --> 50:47.895
When we had lunch,

50:48.179 --> 50:53.765
in October in New York, and he said, I sure hope you're going down to Philadelphia.

50:54.706 --> 50:58.530
And I said, I am, I am, I really am.

50:58.590 --> 51:04.256
Edward Newton, he was a super popular chronicler of the... That's right.

51:04.436 --> 51:12.685
He made rare book collecting popular to an Atlantic monthly audience.

51:13.390 --> 51:14.936
which is quite a feat.

51:15.076 --> 51:16.782
That's not an insignificant achievement.

51:16.802 --> 51:19.994
That's not an insignificant achievement.

51:20.014 --> 51:22.523
And while there were an awful lot of people
