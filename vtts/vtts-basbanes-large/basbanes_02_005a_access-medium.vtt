00:03.305 --> 00:11.624
I went to a place in Monaco where they give you a day's instruction. That's not nearly enough.

00:11.805 --> 00:20.605
Not enough, but I got a rough idea if I worked and I tried to write on it and I thought I was writing badly because

00:21.277 --> 00:26.663
There was no sense of muscular effort, and that applies also to using an electric car, right?

00:26.683 --> 00:28.626
I like to feel that I'm... It's rather like playing the piano.

00:28.646 --> 00:30.588
I like to feel your muscles going into it.

00:31.669 --> 00:35.053
And I just was not writing well.

00:35.073 --> 00:37.976
There was no sensation of creating anything.

00:38.057 --> 00:45.405
And I noticed that with one or two writers, their style has deteriorated.

00:45.425 --> 00:48.769
Albin Tochter wrote a recent book, wrote a third wave.

00:48.749 --> 00:53.524
He said in the middle, I have now started writing this on a word post.

00:53.644 --> 00:56.914
And you can see the drop in the quality inside.

00:56.994 --> 00:58.719
Come on, it's black.

00:58.860 --> 00:59.923
It's black.

01:00.190 --> 01:26.518
You know george lex 10th novel george mills might scan the opens. Well I know he's not the only one. I mean uh our writer uh Len Deighton you know when his last book was called Goodbye, Mickey Mouse. He's a popular writer. He's been using one of these for a long time and uh he admits to me that there's certain

01:26.853 --> 01:27.757
Lack of tension.

01:28.058 --> 01:33.160
You know, it's as though you're leaving it to the machine and your brain sort of turns off.

01:33.180 --> 01:34.284
Your brain's there, you know.

01:34.304 --> 01:36.373
I think it's marvellous revision.

01:37.045 --> 01:41.310
Yes, I'm a bad reviser because I waste a lot of paper.

01:41.330 --> 01:51.922
When I write a novel, I... You're leaving a lot of varying... Well, you know what happens, you sit down, you put the paper in the machine and say, right, I've got to start writing a novel.

01:52.523 --> 01:53.945
So you type one.

01:54.285 --> 01:55.386
That's all right.

01:55.406 --> 01:57.689
One at the top right hand corner, you're all right, you're written.

01:57.709 --> 02:01.854
Then you put chapter one, or just O-N-E, underlined.

02:01.874 --> 02:05.398
And then you attempt a sentence, and this is bad.

02:06.627 --> 02:12.677
tear it up, start again, and eventually you get a first sentence, then you get on to a second sentence, and that's no good.

02:12.717 --> 02:18.487
You know, this takes about, I waste about 20 or more sheets in just trying to get a first page.

02:19.148 --> 02:24.096
All the time we've got a first page, I tend to say, you know, that's it.

02:24.156 --> 02:26.079
Nobody else wants to touch that.

02:26.099 --> 02:27.622
That's as good as I can make it.

02:27.962 --> 02:30.306
I'm just going to test and see how we're doing.

02:32.648 --> 02:33.749
That's fine.

02:33.850 --> 02:38.376
I think it's a different matter with journalism.

02:38.396 --> 02:45.685
I think that writing an article, you don't worry quite as much about qualities of style or accuracy, as you should.

02:45.705 --> 02:46.667
Well, the deadlines.

02:47.027 --> 02:49.150
The deadlines, the deadlines are important.

02:49.190 --> 02:50.171
I'm very fond of deadlines.

02:50.271 --> 02:51.433
I love deadlines.

02:51.785 --> 03:10.924
I get these quite a lot in in Europe you know. I bought certainly two newspapers. One is the Daily Mail in London. The other is uh the Corriere della Sera in Milan, and they

03:11.309 --> 03:19.919
When some event takes place, like, you know, the attempted assassination of the Pope, you see, they write, well, you want 2,000 words in one hour.

03:20.220 --> 03:21.501
I love that.

03:21.521 --> 03:22.382
I myself wonder.

03:22.403 --> 03:23.764
I love that.

03:23.784 --> 03:28.450
I know that I can't spare the time to write too well.

03:28.470 --> 03:30.352
You know, you can't search for it.

03:30.392 --> 03:32.555
That's an interesting statement.

03:32.795 --> 03:33.316
Well, surely.

03:33.336 --> 03:34.357
It makes the style flow.

03:34.577 --> 03:36.760
The style is highly colloquial.

03:37.111 --> 03:39.574
When you read it, you're horrified.

03:39.614 --> 03:40.896
That's what's horrified to read it.

03:41.337 --> 03:47.965
There was a piece you had in the New York Times, I think, in the last summer, in the living section on food.

03:47.985 --> 03:48.626
Oh, yes.

03:48.686 --> 03:49.848
Oh, I clipped it.

03:49.868 --> 03:52.231
I used to be a restaurant reviewer.

03:52.331 --> 03:53.673
I do this occasionally.

03:53.693 --> 03:54.894
When do you know all about it?

03:54.914 --> 03:55.635
Well, I'm a cook.

03:55.695 --> 03:56.616
I do the cooking.

03:56.636 --> 03:57.818
I do the cooking at home.

03:57.838 --> 03:59.921
And my son is a restaurant cook.

03:59.941 --> 04:00.361
Oh, I do.

04:00.421 --> 04:01.403
He's in here.

04:01.523 --> 04:03.746
I trained by the French.

04:03.766 --> 04:06.069
I was a worker.

04:06.329 --> 04:07.050
But...

04:07.368 --> 04:08.310
Where does he work?

04:08.830 --> 04:17.604
Well, he worked at perhaps the best restaurant in the world, which is Phuket, you know, on the Champs-Élysées in Paris.

04:17.645 --> 04:22.332
They call it a brigade, you know, a brigade in the picture.

04:22.412 --> 04:28.482
There was a brigade of 50, or probably more, probably more than 50, and it becomes very personal.

04:29.356 --> 04:37.452
And you have this autocratic chef, you know, the autocratic man who never does any cooking, he just sits in an office like a chef, a real chef.

04:38.093 --> 04:39.296
You become part of a machine.

04:40.739 --> 04:49.356
But he got a job in a bistro on... Ah, thank you.

04:49.842 --> 04:52.546
In Paris.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.749
He was his own boss in the kitchen.

04:54.769 --> 04:55.951
He took over the kitchen.

04:56.031 --> 04:58.034
Thank you very much.

04:58.054 --> 04:58.815
He took over the kitchen.

04:59.456 --> 05:00.698
He was all right at the time.

05:00.718 --> 05:02.661
Where would you like to put that?

05:02.781 --> 05:04.023
Oh, that's the one.

05:04.043 --> 05:05.245
You know what?

05:05.766 --> 05:08.610
I'm going to get in.

05:09.147 --> 05:11.092
Where should we put it?

05:11.113 --> 05:11.734
Oh, here as well.

05:11.754 --> 05:14.442
Yeah, that's my shirt eggs.

05:14.723 --> 05:16.046
Are those your shirt eggs?

05:16.066 --> 05:16.849
Oh, thank you.

05:16.869 --> 05:18.634
Well, that's your what?

05:18.654 --> 05:20.379
That's right, your blueberry muffin.

05:20.399 --> 05:22.685
Your blueberry muffin, that's right.

05:22.705 --> 05:24.490
None of those.

05:24.892 --> 05:31.021
I'll leave too early tomorrow to get anywhere.

05:32.483 --> 05:47.406
The last job my son had was in the Grosvenor Hotel in London, which was a good hotel, a big hotel, but it was all banquets, you know, there was a banquet every day, a thousand people or two thousand, and all he was doing was

05:47.825 --> 05:49.368
cutting cucumbers.

05:49.408 --> 05:50.510
They gave it up.

05:50.530 --> 05:56.119
Well, you have to learn, I guess, there's an apprenticeship in every profession.

05:56.139 --> 06:05.235
It's a long apprenticeship in, you know, in America, well, you just go into a hash joint, I suppose, and fry eggs, but with a French, it's a very serious business.

06:05.255 --> 06:05.776
Very serious.

06:05.796 --> 06:10.744
The whole scope of that piece was how the same dishes

06:11.517 --> 06:13.941
But with the French name, they sound so different.

06:13.981 --> 06:15.564
They sound different, yes.

06:15.584 --> 06:19.370
But there's a lot of snobbishness, if I may say, in America.

06:19.570 --> 06:22.615
There's a lot of snobbishness in America about French food.

06:22.635 --> 06:23.657
You know what I mean?

06:25.359 --> 06:29.486
Faculty wives pride themselves on their gourmet cooking.

06:31.730 --> 06:33.913
Instead of turning out very good.

06:34.602 --> 06:36.005
American dishes.

06:36.826 --> 06:38.148
They give you invitation.

06:38.168 --> 06:41.915
There is fashion and food every day.

06:42.456 --> 06:48.567
There's some very good New England dishes, like New England boiled dinner, which everyone is supposed to despise.

06:48.828 --> 06:49.810
Have you ever tried it?

06:49.830 --> 06:51.092
I love it.

06:52.726 --> 07:14.852
and um there's a lot of things in Boston that's strong really it's just a young or quite clam chowder clenched up make clam chowder. Boston cream pie. Baked thinning patty. Have you ever had that?

07:15.473 --> 07:27.351
Is that Scottish? I've done the cooking in the house now for the last 15 years into my second marriage.

07:28.573 --> 07:31.257
Because my wife is very badly brought up by her mother.

07:31.999 --> 07:33.621
She has no domestic school.

07:34.623 --> 07:37.988
She'll be starving.

07:40.592 --> 07:41.413
Tell me about...

07:42.068 --> 08:09.578
the distinction between an entertainment and a novel. Are we to take an entertainment not as seriously as a novel, or? You're not to take it seriously at all. Your attitude should be one of total relaxation, and then if there's anything in the novel that should work on the subliminal level. Would you call this an experiment, or?

08:10.233 --> 08:22.010
It is in the sense that it's an attempt to allow a visual medium to influence a verbal medium.

08:22.550 --> 08:29.440
It's an attempt to imitate television, to imitate the process of watching television.

08:30.618 --> 08:31.699
In one of two ways.

08:31.940 --> 08:35.805
Either you're watching three screens at the same time, which I think will come.

08:35.965 --> 08:38.288
I think it's going to happen.

08:38.308 --> 08:40.972
I think we've got more information than from getting a single screen.

08:40.992 --> 08:49.844
Do you think the powers of concentration of people are... My feeling is that they're declining, not getting... Well, they're taking in a lot of visual material.

08:50.444 --> 09:00.017
I mean, if you consider the, you know, the Oscar Awards last night, there comes a moment when you've got to take in six or seven faces, in sets,

09:00.233 --> 09:02.981
you know, round probably two images, one on top of the other.

09:03.041 --> 09:04.585
People would take that in all right.

09:04.605 --> 09:12.066
But I was thinking rather of, when you're watching television late at night, there are more commercials than earlier.

09:12.552 --> 09:38.256
and uh you have to keep switching from one channel to another. You have to you know, just that switcher as a matter of fact that is what that novel is. So when they when the commercial will come out on one thing you go to another. You won't become adamant following three or even more uh storylines in the same time that's what it was. I have a daughter, 18 months old, and she destroyed my switcher

09:39.063 --> 09:40.364
Which is good.

09:40.385 --> 09:43.608
Well, what happens now?

09:44.029 --> 09:49.395
Well, I read the book, which I have to do anyway.

09:49.515 --> 09:52.218
But it doesn't bother me.

09:52.238 --> 09:55.462
As a matter of fact, I can leave the TV on in the background.

09:56.243 --> 09:59.126
Maybe it's part of my training as a newspaper man.

09:59.787 --> 10:01.088
I can't work without knowledge.

10:01.388 --> 10:10.650
You can't write if you're listening to music.

10:10.871 --> 10:13.236
Well, the rhythm's getting in the way.

10:13.277 --> 10:15.442
That's very interesting, but you're a musician.

10:15.702 --> 10:18.469
Well, it's true, but I can't do it.

10:18.854 --> 10:25.708
You know, it's very tempting to tell somebody to start writing, but the rhythm could get in the way.

10:27.271 --> 10:33.664
In a newspaper newsroom, for instance, there are certain sounds which are normal.

10:33.684 --> 10:33.984
I know.

10:34.004 --> 10:35.447
I know them, yes.

10:35.507 --> 10:37.892
I've worked on a newspaper myself.

10:38.125 --> 11:05.027
If anything improves that is not part of the normal, if some workmen are in there, it will destroy and you'll scream. I mean you'll throw things, but all the other noises yelling for coffee the machines clacking away the bells and all these other things, there is a rhythm to that which is actually soothing. There's also a limit to what you can take in. I'm living in Monaco and during the winter it's not too bad

11:05.530 --> 11:10.955
But round about now, the noise starts on a quite remarkable scale.

11:11.016 --> 11:16.641
We start off with a Grand Prix, and the noise of the Grand Prix surrounds us.

11:17.542 --> 11:19.044
It's quite incredible.

11:20.185 --> 11:23.508
And then summer comes, and the tourists come, and there's 24-hour,

11:23.528 --> 11:24.549
24-hour traffic.

11:24.569 --> 11:30.815
24-hour, because I'm living on the main road between East and Italy.

11:32.057 --> 11:33.738
And 24 hours, I can't stand it.

11:33.798 --> 11:34.339
I've got to leave.

11:34.724 --> 11:36.026
I've reached the limit of toleration.

11:37.489 --> 11:41.435
But the ordinary noise of the house, I like it.

11:41.455 --> 11:42.737
Telephones, people shout.

11:43.859 --> 11:47.805
My wife's Italian, so it's a lot of shows.

11:47.865 --> 11:53.875
My premier literary obsession is studying Shakespeare, for me.

11:53.995 --> 11:57.441
And I have an enormous library.

11:57.944 --> 12:09.793
you know maybe four or five hundred volumes. On Shakespere? Just on Shakespeare, and I've read all of your Shakespeare. I haven't written much. But well you've written, you've got a respectable shelf

12:10.128 --> 12:12.712
And you wouldn't mind if I ask you a few questions.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.956
Please, please do, yeah.

12:14.976 --> 12:15.898
Couldn't please me better.

12:15.918 --> 12:34.168
I have, in fact, used your suggestion that the 46th Psalm was written by Shakespeare, this 46th year with the 46th word from the beginning and the 46th word from King King as his signature.

12:34.549 --> 12:35.190
That's right.

12:35.170 --> 12:36.932
Well, I made a story out of that.

12:36.952 --> 12:38.554
And I read that particular story.

12:38.574 --> 12:41.238
That was published by Delaware Press, I think.

12:41.558 --> 12:42.760
Oh, that's where you found it.

12:42.980 --> 12:44.502
I see.

12:44.522 --> 12:46.304
Interesting.

12:46.445 --> 13:04.468
I wrote that story for an American homosexual living in Verona who bought a fine old hand press, an American hand press, and produces, or was producing, remarkable hand-printed books.

13:04.853 --> 13:15.154
bound in leather, which is sold on subscription for $5,000 each, limiting the number, probably so about 80.

13:15.374 --> 13:18.521
And I did this beautifully done.

13:18.541 --> 13:20.244
He printed it beautifully.

13:20.264 --> 13:23.571
I called it Will and Testament Day.

13:24.530 --> 13:50.470
Exactly. It's not being produced in England. It's just coming out of... It's fairly accurate. I think that um they discovered I think a man called Martin Seymour Smith in Britain discovered certain letters which seemed to prove that Ben Jonson had been involved in the Katesby Conspiracy on the inside

13:50.821 --> 14:11.126
and pretended to become a Catholic and then renounced it all when the conspirators were caught and drank off the communion cup in the Church of England in token of his belief.

14:11.726 --> 14:13.028
I don't see what else you can say.

14:13.088 --> 14:18.735
That 46th Psalm business is... It's a wonderful... It can't be an accident.

14:19.103 --> 14:21.846
And the poetry is beautiful, too.

14:22.146 --> 14:24.348
Yes, but can you see how it connects?

14:24.368 --> 14:24.568
No.

14:25.449 --> 14:29.193
Especially where you point out what the earlier words were.

14:29.273 --> 14:31.054
They weren't shaked and they weren't speared.

14:31.075 --> 14:32.616
They weren't.

14:32.676 --> 14:34.117
They were rattle or something.

14:34.398 --> 14:36.259
That's right, yeah.

14:36.280 --> 14:42.245
Well, I've just been translating that particular story into French, and I was watching imagine the difference, isn't it?

14:42.265 --> 14:45.128
But that meant looking at the French version.

14:45.665 --> 14:50.532
Which is quite remote, quite remote.

14:50.572 --> 14:59.545
But the irony of the thing is, if it's ironic, is that he's a man who didn't even care whether he published his own plays in his lifetime.

14:59.605 --> 15:00.546
Well, that's remarkable.

15:00.626 --> 15:01.808
That's quite astonishing.

15:01.828 --> 15:03.150
That's quite astonishing.

15:03.390 --> 15:10.761
I did an interview last summer with Robert Giroux, the London publisher, and I will ask you the same question I asked him.

15:11.146 --> 15:13.471
But I'll tell you what, I asked him what he answered.

15:13.531 --> 15:21.487
I said, if you were able to summon forth Shakespeare and leave Crossroads on and bring him forward for an hour, what would you ask him?

15:21.647 --> 15:22.569
What would you like to know?

15:22.609 --> 15:25.235
He said, oh boy, what a question.

15:25.255 --> 15:26.337
That is an hour.

15:27.025 --> 15:29.989
He said, well, I would like to know, because I'm a publisher.

15:30.069 --> 15:33.634
Why the hell didn't he ever want to publish his own works?

15:33.754 --> 15:35.416
He said, Dad, I'd like to know.

15:35.697 --> 15:37.820
He must have known that he was wonderful.

15:37.840 --> 15:45.490
I don't think, I have a feeling that he'd never answer any literary questions at all.

15:45.510 --> 15:46.772
If he said...

15:47.680 --> 15:51.224
What's the fluctuation like in the price of land in the factory area?

15:51.244 --> 15:58.794
It gives you probably a long learning discussion of how it had changed since 1564, you know, when it went up by one shilling in 1957, you know, etc.

15:58.874 --> 16:03.820
I honestly don't think he'd answer any literary questions.

16:03.840 --> 16:10.989
There's no doubt he had, though, strong artistic impulses, and what an artist, what a conscious artist.

16:11.109 --> 16:15.274
I don't think he really gave a damn about discussions.

16:16.233 --> 16:25.863
Except from the viewpoint of a practical dramaturgy, you know, the immediate problem of putting a thing on.

16:25.883 --> 16:44.181
And I often feel that, you know, with Hamlet, there must have been a hell of a row between him and Dick Berkey, who, I'll tell you what, the producer who produced these things, over Troilus and Gressler, where he only had one performance.

16:44.431 --> 16:50.244
And, you know, if you read the quarto, it says, this was never clapper-clawed by the multitude.

16:50.264 --> 16:53.491
You know, nobody likes it, I think, in other words.

16:53.591 --> 16:55.615
I don't think it holds up as a play, though, do you?

16:55.715 --> 16:59.724
Well, it's a remarkable poem, you know.

17:00.165 --> 17:01.027
As a play, I don't know.

17:01.067 --> 17:01.909
It depends how it's produced.

17:01.929 --> 17:04.735
But I feel sure that there was a lot of stuff.

17:05.204 --> 17:09.109
he wrote for a transgressor, which was cut.

17:10.210 --> 17:12.473
Verbage insisted it be cut.

17:12.493 --> 17:14.375
Thank you.

17:14.395 --> 17:15.296
Thank you.

17:15.777 --> 17:19.141
And Shakespeare said that he's not going to get away with that.

17:19.161 --> 17:21.163
I'm going to put that back in the next play.

17:21.223 --> 17:24.087
And when it came to Hamlet, I put it all back in again.

17:24.147 --> 17:27.991
You know, we had this long, long visit with Hecuba.

17:28.652 --> 17:30.054
Beautiful, but quite irrelevant.

17:30.194 --> 17:31.836
And Shakespeare, the

17:32.238 --> 17:42.915
The cunning artist, you know, makes it relevant by having Hamlet to speak, you know, about what's Hecuba to him, or, you know, you could cut that out, and not that anybody would want to.

17:42.995 --> 17:43.676
I think no difference.

17:43.696 --> 17:47.242
Well, as George had said, would he have wanted a thousand luck?

17:47.603 --> 17:49.886
Would he have wanted a thousand?

17:49.906 --> 17:50.227
Yeah.

17:50.247 --> 17:51.028
Yes, that's right.

17:51.128 --> 17:52.491
Sufflaminandles, yes.

17:52.551 --> 17:53.432
Sufflaminandles.

17:53.672 --> 17:54.634
How would you think?

17:54.952 --> 18:11.396
What would you ask him about?

18:12.317 --> 18:14.821
What would you like to know?

18:15.101 --> 18:16.723
I know it's a damn silly question.

18:16.743 --> 18:19.187
I'd like to know about the dark lady.

18:19.555 --> 18:22.138
Who was the dark lady and how dark was she?

18:22.178 --> 18:23.119
You'd get right to it.

18:23.159 --> 18:26.462
Would you be interested in the second best beds?

18:26.542 --> 18:29.545
No, I think I can explain that.

18:29.765 --> 18:46.862
I don't think there's really any need to ask a question, because if Susanna took over the best bedroom, which she would have to, Anne, as the dowager,

18:47.433 --> 18:51.178
could automatically take the second best bed.

18:51.198 --> 18:54.022
It's a matter of the call of heaven.

18:54.042 --> 18:56.865
In any case, the second best bed must have been the bed they had when they were married.

18:56.885 --> 19:03.614
It wasn't necessarily a nasty slap at her, the second best bed.

19:04.075 --> 19:05.336
But she was entitled to that anyway.

19:06.017 --> 19:09.762
Your questions wouldn't be then literary or creative.

19:10.771 --> 19:15.699
God, I'm absolutely convinced he would give you no answer.

19:16.060 --> 19:17.663
You try, however, I'm sure.

19:17.683 --> 19:18.184
I don't think I could.

19:18.224 --> 19:23.412
What do you mean by this line, Master Shakespeare?

19:23.432 --> 19:23.753
I don't know.

19:23.853 --> 19:24.715
I'm sure.

19:24.735 --> 19:31.446
Well, I think this... What I would be most interested in, thankfully, would be listening to his voice.

19:32.118 --> 19:35.381
People tend to forget that Shakespeare had a voice.

19:35.421 --> 19:36.882
Shakespeare himself was an actor.

19:37.043 --> 19:39.425
I'd like to know how good an actor he was, how he used his voice.

19:39.505 --> 19:49.835
And to check whether my own, well, not my own, but linguistic suppositions as to how he spoke are correct.

19:49.935 --> 19:51.596
I think they probably are.

19:52.217 --> 19:54.659
I can give you a fairly good imitation of Shakespeare's voice myself.

19:54.799 --> 19:56.621
Oh, please.

19:56.641 --> 19:58.463
Oh, really?

19:58.503 --> 20:01.045
Well, you know, Shakespeare played... All right, then.

20:01.362 --> 20:03.825
Well, Hamlet, anyway.

20:03.845 --> 20:05.908
To be or not to be, that is the question.

20:05.948 --> 20:14.640
Whether it is nobler in the mind to suffer with slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end.

20:14.761 --> 20:19.547
It's closer to New England than to New England.

20:20.288 --> 20:21.951
And they spoke very rapidly.

20:21.971 --> 20:23.192
Very rapidly.

20:23.252 --> 20:23.873
Very rapidly.

20:23.893 --> 20:30.222
So when you said the two-hour traffic of this stage, it takes us three and a half to four hours to do a thorough Hamlet...

20:30.792 --> 20:34.417
I directed it myself once.

20:34.537 --> 20:35.919
It took two nights.

20:36.840 --> 20:38.823
It took two hours per night.

20:38.843 --> 20:41.166
Four hours per night.

20:41.267 --> 20:53.524
But... English was spoken rapidly on the stage until these Victorians like Henry Irving began to slow it down.

20:53.644 --> 20:57.389
It was partly because of the size of the theatres in London.

20:57.429 --> 21:00.293
The Theatre Regulating Act...

21:00.678 --> 21:04.043
a limited serious drama to two theatres.

21:04.063 --> 21:08.310
These were the Theatre Royal at Glory Lane and the one at Covent Garden.

21:08.330 --> 21:09.872
They were very big, they were very big theatres.

21:10.393 --> 21:13.898
And so they had to develop a technique whereby every word was clear of the bag.

21:13.918 --> 21:15.220
This meant speaking very slowly.

21:15.240 --> 21:26.517
And the technique went on into Victorian times with Henry Irving and Beardbone Tree, you know, to be or not to be, you know, that sort of thing.

21:26.497 --> 21:30.362
Then the man who changed all was Harley Grandel Barker.

21:30.402 --> 21:39.035
He suddenly said, back to rapidity of speech, and they said, well, supposing we can't understand this, but that's not the point.

21:39.055 --> 21:41.017
That's not the point at all.

21:41.037 --> 21:45.043
There's a lot of Shakespeare you can't understand, unless you look at it, look at the text.

21:45.844 --> 21:49.309
But he said, the speed, the speed, and he was right.

21:49.329 --> 21:54.276
I don't know whether America's really picked up that point, but the Royal Shakespeare company picked it up.

21:55.758 --> 22:03.615
And I'm pretty sure that Shakespeare spoke rapidly, rather like an Italian, not like an American.

22:03.896 --> 22:04.941
Americans speak slowly.

22:05.967 --> 22:07.128
I don't know where they get this from.

22:08.630 --> 22:10.852
Do you think he was a good actor?

22:10.872 --> 22:12.133
No, I don't either.

22:12.213 --> 22:14.075
A louty actor, probably.

22:14.095 --> 22:15.196
But he was listed, of course.

22:15.617 --> 22:17.619
He had quite a place in it.

22:18.780 --> 22:20.922
Well, he's got his mind, I think, probably.

22:20.942 --> 22:23.164
He played the ghost in Hamlet, the ghost.

22:23.264 --> 22:25.467
Yeah, that's what I think they say.

22:25.487 --> 22:31.272
He played in Ben Jonson's Janus, or part of that, I don't know.

22:32.053 --> 22:33.915
And he played in Every Man in His Humor.

22:35.802 --> 22:46.238
Um, I think he was probably a good middle, he would never win an Oscar, not like Ben Kingsley, but, you know, couldn't be bothered to learn the line.

22:46.258 --> 22:59.278
How about visualizing real people like this, in terms of having fictional work as you can, or even in more contemporary type people, Freudian class people?

22:59.545 --> 23:03.471
What kind of problems do you face with this?

23:03.491 --> 23:07.056
Well, you've got to pretend there are no problems, otherwise you'd never do it right.

23:07.076 --> 23:11.002
You've got to make a very bold step, take a very bold step.

23:11.022 --> 23:13.626
Is it making a new character, or do you try a new character?

23:13.646 --> 23:22.879
Well, I think most of the characters become one's self, in the sense that you're approaching them to be inside, which means it's your inside.

23:22.919 --> 23:28.287
But what worries me very frequently is the speech rhythms they use.

23:28.925 --> 23:32.533
The idiom is that they tend to be my own.

23:32.553 --> 23:34.216
That's what worries me.

23:34.417 --> 23:39.768
I end up with a bunch of characters who are a bit too like me to be as if acceptable.

23:39.788 --> 23:40.790
But I think that's fairly common.

23:41.211 --> 23:45.921
I think the scenes with Freud and his wife are priceless.

23:46.255 --> 23:47.757
I don't know whether it happened or not.

23:47.777 --> 23:48.518
I don't know.

23:48.598 --> 23:49.379
I just don't know.

23:49.399 --> 23:53.583
I wish he's trying to shut him up when he says a couple of times.

23:53.603 --> 23:55.225
What do you mean about sex?

23:55.305 --> 23:56.086
Oh, no.

23:56.106 --> 23:59.370
What do you mean about probably too?

23:59.430 --> 24:01.232
Do you think of anything except sex?

24:01.552 --> 24:02.213
No.

24:02.373 --> 24:04.696
I mean, about probably too.

24:04.716 --> 24:09.161
And then he brings in the Oedipus.

24:09.922 --> 24:10.743
That's right.

24:10.883 --> 24:12.685
You've translated that.

24:13.036 --> 24:17.024
That's my translation, that's my translation.

24:17.044 --> 24:27.805
Is this a matter of employing material that you're... To give the critics notice, they never do.

24:29.236 --> 24:39.559
No, but it's easy, obviously, to use your... As you get older, you know, you have a hell of a lot of stuff behind you, and why not utilize something to do?

24:40.100 --> 24:45.633
I do a lot of this cheating, but you as a journalist will understand this.

24:45.653 --> 24:47.076
When somebody dies...

24:47.630 --> 25:06.904
let me ask you that i'm asked for a quick victory. Let's see if i've written anything in the past. Sure well the clips we call it in our business we say pull the clips. That's right pretend i'm writing it for the first time nobody knows nobody interesting about Shakespear. Are you um

25:07.559 --> 25:13.587
Have you studied this question of Shakespeare's speech, the way they actually spoke English?

25:14.609 --> 25:15.250
I'm sorry, sir.

25:15.290 --> 25:19.416
Have you studied the way that they actually spoke?

25:19.776 --> 25:36.199
I haven't, I'm sure there is a... But there's a kind of, on the part of a lot of American actors, there's a sort of false reverence, you know, for people like Olivia and John Gilbert, whereas American speech, especially in this area, would...

25:36.618 --> 25:42.129
come far closer to what shape we're actually used.

25:42.149 --> 25:55.276
The origin of the local streets of Plymouth is pretty far west, but close enough to Stratford.

25:55.396 --> 25:57.360
I have read that as a matter of fact.

25:57.813 --> 26:20.682
There is a book that came out from Oxford about two years ag, very forbidding intimidating. Well it can be, but it's got to be approached much more humanly, but it's a combination of Dublin, Dublin speech and

26:20.948 --> 26:25.516
You know, if one goes to Dublin, you'll hear the same vowel sounds.

26:25.616 --> 26:30.204
Irish speech is much more conservative than British.

26:30.224 --> 26:32.568
American speech as conservative, but British is not.

26:32.648 --> 26:34.010
It's strange, I don't know why.

26:34.190 --> 26:34.811
I don't know why.

26:35.613 --> 26:37.055
I mean, the British are conservative.

26:37.115 --> 26:38.738
Conservative people, the Americans are not.

26:39.359 --> 26:40.580
I don't think so.

26:40.600 --> 26:41.741
Well, Americans are very progressive.

26:41.901 --> 26:42.622
I don't know.

26:42.682 --> 26:45.645
I think we tend to be very conservative at our level.

26:45.865 --> 26:51.330
We seem to have demonstrated this several times in the last few months.

26:51.390 --> 26:52.831
No, you make things.

26:52.871 --> 26:54.553
The new things come from America, don't they?

26:54.613 --> 26:55.253
The new thing.

26:55.273 --> 26:57.415
We're always the West for new things.

26:58.296 --> 26:59.577
And we get them.

26:59.877 --> 27:05.963
I don't mean new technology, but new philosophers.

27:05.983 --> 27:08.505
The new philosophers come with you.

27:08.722 --> 27:12.490
You know, this is ridiculous, I must have some time.

27:12.570 --> 27:28.705
If you want more coffee, if you do... How about the exercise in writing science fiction?

27:29.275 --> 27:34.844
Oh, that's not science fiction, but... It's a very loose term.

27:35.144 --> 27:40.152
The whole point about that segment, it's not science fiction.

27:40.172 --> 27:42.796
It's about people, it's not about machines.

27:42.816 --> 27:44.158
It's about people.

27:44.178 --> 27:45.640
Is that what science fiction is, though?

27:45.660 --> 27:47.202
It's about machines?

27:47.423 --> 27:50.027
It's very rarely about people.

27:50.047 --> 27:56.717
But what I wanted to do, I could do it, I didn't have the skill,

27:57.085 --> 28:06.379
write in the manner of Henry James, you see, about people facing, you know, the final catechism.

28:07.480 --> 28:11.466
Of course, if you did write in the style of Henry James, the final catechism would disappear entirely.

28:11.626 --> 28:12.508
It would become irrelevant.

28:13.669 --> 28:14.931
Which it is, in a sense.

28:14.951 --> 28:18.216
It's not, you know, the end of the world is not very interesting, is it?

28:19.225 --> 28:30.382
Well, he doesn't really believe in it.

28:31.064 --> 28:38.415
He doesn't really believe in it.

28:38.750 --> 28:40.732
I don't believe in it either.

28:40.752 --> 28:42.374
No do I, I don't read it.

28:42.454 --> 28:44.116
I find most of it very, very dull.

28:44.617 --> 28:45.738
Very dull written.

28:45.758 --> 28:47.080
Well, because it lacks character.

28:47.220 --> 28:49.322
I think it's it.

28:49.362 --> 28:52.486
The best one is still, well, the best.

28:52.907 --> 28:55.169
Could I have some more tea, please?

28:55.490 --> 28:56.851
Could I have some strong tea?

28:56.871 --> 28:59.154
I mean, Boston usually has the best tea in the world.

28:59.174 --> 29:00.616
All you give me is one tea bag.

29:00.636 --> 29:02.258
I'll tell you, we're going to take care of you.

29:02.478 --> 29:03.179
That's right.

29:03.239 --> 29:04.140
You got the wrong weight.

29:04.160 --> 29:04.801
I'm not a weight.

29:04.941 --> 29:05.862
I'm sorry.

29:05.942 --> 29:06.543
I know that.

29:06.683 --> 29:07.624
I'd like some more glasses.

29:07.644 --> 29:08.605
Thank you very much.

29:09.665 --> 29:10.486
H.G.

29:11.608 --> 29:36.668
Wells is still the best, you know, I think because, you know, the War of the Worlds is good, totally typical, but what is interesting in that book is people, especially, there's one old man in the book who says, you know, right, they're going to destroy the world, and

29:36.884 --> 29:38.847
Things will never be as they were before.

29:38.867 --> 29:43.673
I remember you could buy tinned salmon once, you know, and eat it with vinegar.

29:43.773 --> 29:44.574
That's it.

29:44.895 --> 29:46.156
The taste buds.

29:46.277 --> 29:56.610
Do you ever have a comment in there that, in a way, how Paradise Lost could be seen as a form of science fiction?

29:56.811 --> 30:04.461
I'm sure that... He attempts a definition of science fiction.

30:04.880 --> 30:06.521
I don't think it's right.

30:06.602 --> 30:10.145
I think it begins with Daniel Defoe.

30:10.165 --> 30:10.805
I believe that.

30:10.825 --> 30:14.168
It begins with Daniel Defoe's, God bless you, sir.

30:14.248 --> 30:16.070
Just you will make up for the last one.

30:16.110 --> 30:17.431
You're very kind.

30:17.471 --> 30:21.915
Thank you.

30:22.315 --> 30:25.038
The Journal of the Plague Year.

30:25.138 --> 30:27.200
By Daniel Defoe.

30:27.220 --> 30:29.522
Which I haven't read, I need to say.

30:29.542 --> 30:30.462
No, there's no need to.

30:30.482 --> 30:31.483
Well, you'd like it anyway.

30:31.683 --> 30:34.566
You know, pick it up.

30:35.187 --> 30:36.168
You'll like it.

30:36.489 --> 30:39.012
It's science fiction in that.

30:39.092 --> 30:47.404
It's about an event which nobody's prepared for, which obviously requires a scientific response.

30:48.085 --> 30:49.447
It doesn't get it.

30:49.507 --> 30:52.090
People are not capable of coping with the organic matter.

30:52.110 --> 30:53.092
You don't know what it is.

30:53.152 --> 30:54.033
You don't know how to cure it.

30:54.814 --> 31:02.865
And what happens to a whole city, a whole vast group of people, how they respond to it?

31:03.284 --> 31:18.050
And the remarkable thing about the book is that you think that it's a journalistic record, and you suddenly realise that Defoe was born in 1660, was only, what, five, when the Great Plague happened.

31:19.132 --> 31:24.702
And it's a cunning journalistic job, you know, he's read the document, pretended he was there,

31:25.610 --> 31:30.122
and dished it up in a very unflowery style.

31:30.162 --> 31:34.253
You can hear the rattle the tide by the way.

31:34.273 --> 31:34.975
A fast job.

31:35.376 --> 31:37.582
A fast job, without chapter division.

31:37.643 --> 31:39.407
No chapter division, no time for that.

31:39.447 --> 31:41.914
Straight on playing the way.

31:42.113 --> 32:06.670
80 pages and it's a great man. Well it feels genuine. It feels real genuine. Your book, I we actually see the switches, I mean, you don't you don't announce that we're going from from the the problem of links before and then on to trotsky. We just we just move immediately immediately we switch. Occasionally there's a link

32:07.038 --> 32:09.641
what the television used to call blue.

32:09.661 --> 32:14.767
It's very, very occasional.

32:14.787 --> 32:16.369
But it looks very arbitrary.

32:16.870 --> 32:18.231
In a sense it is arbitrary.

32:18.251 --> 32:25.320
But if you look more closely you'll find you have the three major narrative forms.

32:26.261 --> 32:29.244
You have the Broadway musical which is a major narrative form.

32:29.304 --> 32:33.389
You have the television serial and you have the novels.

32:35.492 --> 32:36.673
You have three

32:37.126 --> 32:43.718
three events which seem to me to be possibly the most important event.

32:43.738 --> 32:56.181
The American discovery of the possibility of living in space, the unconscious, which is the same as space, and the possibility of creating a world of social society

32:56.684 --> 33:00.389
which is so impossible.

33:00.509 --> 33:04.995
It goes a bit deeper.

33:05.475 --> 33:09.581
That's a wonderful... True.

33:09.621 --> 33:13.426
I love the fact that you wrote your own dust jacket for it.

33:13.446 --> 33:19.654
Well, that again is probably a trick, but when the book came out, something railing about

33:20.022 --> 33:46.519
some of the dust jacket verbs that you need. It's very embarrassing. Either the person who has written or hasn't read the book or has read it and has decided to give you everything that happens. Sometimes if you're reviewing it won't be very grateful. If you're pressed and the deadline is on on you and you need something but I know immediately. When my reviewers have about 80 people who review for me

33:47.056 --> 33:49.339
How many books do you review?

33:49.359 --> 33:51.201
You do all the books you're doing, do you?

33:51.221 --> 33:54.305
No, I have a page every Sunday for which I assign three-way.

33:54.325 --> 33:57.268
We've already reviewed your book on my Sunday page.

33:57.689 --> 33:59.831
Oh, God bless you, sir.

33:59.871 --> 34:01.253
God bless you.

34:01.273 --> 34:03.295
It may sell two or three copies, you know.

34:03.335 --> 34:05.758
There's a fellow who reviewed it did a wonderful job.

34:05.918 --> 34:09.182
I gave it a nice two-way, tiny three-way novel.

34:09.162 --> 34:11.765
There's a lot of two-way tugging.

34:12.866 --> 34:15.609
Well, no, the other thing, I'm very grateful, really.

34:15.729 --> 34:16.210
Sincerely.

34:16.270 --> 34:19.293
And then my piece will run next week in the evening paper.

34:19.513 --> 34:21.736
Really good.

34:21.936 --> 34:23.658
But we do about ten books a week anyway.

34:23.678 --> 34:24.058
It's a lot.

34:24.098 --> 34:26.401
Well, I know what life was like.

34:26.481 --> 34:35.851
When I came back from Malaya with a death sentence, I'd been given a year to live, but this was commuted to life.

34:36.031 --> 34:37.633
I saw life.

34:38.204 --> 34:50.163
I had a difficult job of earning a living as a writer during that terminal year, pseudo-terminal year, and I wrote five and a half novels.

34:51.345 --> 34:54.370
The following year... In that one year, five and a half novels?

34:54.410 --> 34:55.432
Well, it is possible.

34:55.472 --> 34:58.877
I mean, indeed, I ended up by writing... What year was it?

34:58.897 --> 34:59.959
1959.

35:00.395 --> 35:10.084
I ended up writing my 2,000 daily words before breakfast, up the day to myself, which is possible if you don't write too carefully.

35:10.745 --> 35:11.406
Nobody cares.

35:12.006 --> 35:26.200
No, the point I was going to make was this, that I got my first journalistic, my, yes, my first posthumous journalistic job with the Yorkshire Post, which is a paper you won't know.

35:27.277 --> 35:29.279
It's a very old British paper.

35:29.299 --> 35:31.102
It's published in Leeds in Yorkshire.

35:31.122 --> 35:34.646
It's hard-headed, you know, in Yorkshire.

35:35.507 --> 35:37.870
And they gave me the job of reviewing all the fiction.

35:38.671 --> 35:41.274
And I had no idea at the time what this entailed.

35:41.294 --> 35:44.157
I had no idea how much fiction I published.

35:44.177 --> 35:50.565
They paid me six pounds, which was what, about ten dollars?

35:50.805 --> 35:53.108
Ten dollars an hour to live on that.

35:53.128 --> 35:54.229
They got all the books.

35:54.361 --> 35:55.343
All of them.

35:55.704 --> 35:57.529
And it is quite incredible.

35:58.271 --> 36:00.115
You're going to see my library after five years.

36:00.135 --> 36:00.897
Well, you sell them.

36:00.917 --> 36:01.498
You sell them.

36:01.699 --> 36:02.200
You sell them.

36:02.361 --> 36:05.127
I keep what I... Well, you keep selling them.

36:05.228 --> 36:06.290
Well, I don't sell them.

36:06.410 --> 36:07.353
I'll be honest with you.

36:07.373 --> 36:09.518
I get my access to the public library.

36:09.498 --> 36:13.082
Well, you're a gentleman, but... I was a bit... I'm also careful.

36:13.603 --> 36:14.904
Well, I was a bit worried.

36:14.924 --> 36:16.787
I was a bit worried about money then.

36:16.807 --> 36:23.615
And every other Monday, I used to fill two suitcases with books.

36:23.635 --> 36:26.498
And the village where I was living inside... All was said the same thing.

36:26.558 --> 36:28.400
And there were all persuasions.

36:28.420 --> 36:29.381
Well, indeed.

36:29.401 --> 36:30.923
I realize that now.

36:30.983 --> 36:31.764
Like a bloody fool.

36:31.904 --> 36:34.167
I was given a lot of persuasion for money.

36:34.187 --> 36:34.948
Like an idiot.

36:34.928 --> 36:40.876
I used to go to the States.

36:42.018 --> 36:45.042
They always said to me, he's leaving his wife again.

36:45.062 --> 36:48.607
I had no memory of it.

36:48.627 --> 37:02.826
I'd take them to Charling Cross Station in London and get off on the Strand and walk up the Strand of Feet Street, where the only Jewish bookseller in London, I'm called Lewis Simmons, and he would buy these books half-bought.

37:03.262 --> 37:12.692
It'd give you notes, banknotes, new, fresh banknotes, lovely, clean crevices, which were yours.

37:12.712 --> 37:15.075
It was your money, my money.

37:15.175 --> 37:19.599
You'd walk back to the station and buy a bottle of brandy on the way with choice cigars.

37:20.100 --> 37:21.501
That was marvellous.

37:21.521 --> 37:23.564
I've never had that since.

37:23.584 --> 37:27.528
I meant for me, you said you were under a death sentence for a year.

37:27.548 --> 37:29.870
Did you tell me what you mean by that?

37:29.890 --> 37:31.412
Well, I was working in...

37:32.168 --> 37:38.998
In Borneo, in the north, there are three terraces there.

37:39.259 --> 37:45.408
Sarawak, British North Borneo, which has changed to Sabah.

37:45.428 --> 37:46.149
It's called Sabah.

37:46.189 --> 37:50.295
And in the middle, there's a little sultanate called Brunei.

37:50.315 --> 37:54.201
Brunei is the Malay name for Borneo.

37:54.221 --> 37:57.666
And this was run by sultan and family.

37:57.686 --> 37:59.529
And they discovered oil.

37:59.689 --> 38:00.510
They discovered oil.

38:00.570 --> 38:01.652
A shell was there.

38:02.763 --> 38:10.795
And I was teaching there, and it was a desperate and difficult place to live in.

38:10.815 --> 38:13.399
There was a lot of underground political activities.

38:13.419 --> 38:23.134
It was a dangerous place, and one day I became so bored to work everything that I just lay down on the floor of a classroom.

38:23.806 --> 38:28.411
I must have been pretty ill to do that, I suppose, but I said, right, let somebody do something about it.

38:28.611 --> 38:29.733
And they were very quick.

38:29.753 --> 38:36.880
They got me on a stretcher and sent me onto a plane and sent me home and said I had a cerebral tuber.

38:38.722 --> 38:45.970
I didn't believe it for one minute, but they said I had too much protein in the spinal fluid.

38:45.990 --> 38:50.395
How you gauge the correct amount, I don't know.

38:50.415 --> 38:52.257
It's not a regular test, is it?

38:52.277 --> 38:53.779
You know, if you had a regular

38:54.046 --> 38:55.974
drawing off like that.

38:56.958 --> 39:02.098
So they said then that after all the tests they said that the tumor is inoperable.

39:02.517 --> 39:03.659
We'll give you a year to live.

39:04.600 --> 39:06.963
But I still think it was a put-up job.

39:06.983 --> 39:09.247
I think it was something very fishy in it.

39:09.387 --> 39:15.115
I mean, did they actually perceive a tumor, or they just assumed that one was there?

39:15.175 --> 39:18.299
They assumed something on the strength of the protein.

39:18.359 --> 39:20.843
But I believe it was a political work.

39:20.883 --> 39:24.688
The British are quite cunning, as you know, and can be quite cunning.

39:24.709 --> 39:25.690
They used to be quite cunning.

39:26.591 --> 39:32.119
We'd had a visit from the Duke of Edinburgh, and my first wife is now dead.

39:32.335 --> 39:37.260
Welsh, very fiery, and it was a garden party.

39:37.280 --> 39:39.183
And the Duke said, you know, is everything all right here?

39:39.203 --> 39:40.764
And he said, oh, yes, thank you, Your Highness.

39:40.864 --> 39:44.228
And my wife said, no, everything is fucking terrible here.

39:45.349 --> 39:49.394
He was very interested in this, you know, being a sailor, you know, he didn't find the language in this.

39:49.554 --> 39:51.276
I spent three years at sea myself.

39:51.356 --> 39:52.658
Well, you know what it's like.

39:52.678 --> 39:53.979
He's rather a good man, you know.

39:54.319 --> 39:55.060
Philip, he's a good man.

39:55.100 --> 39:56.182
He's put up in a lot.

39:56.322 --> 39:56.842
He's a good man.

39:57.002 --> 39:58.444
He hates journalists, but he's a good man.

39:58.880 --> 40:05.515
And we had the British resident, you know, and the High Commissioner frowning like hell.

40:05.535 --> 40:11.427
And I think that they were determined to get us out, you see, under any pretext.

40:11.448 --> 40:15.336
But you came home for moving that he wanted out here to live.

40:15.502 --> 40:16.543
I hadn't been told.

40:16.604 --> 40:18.046
My wife had been told.

40:18.146 --> 40:22.231
But certainly something bothered you to write fresh and half knowledge.

40:22.252 --> 40:22.912
What could you do?

40:22.973 --> 40:26.077
This burst of energy must have come from somewhere.

40:26.417 --> 40:27.899
Probably a cerebral tumour.

40:27.960 --> 40:29.221
I don't know.

40:29.241 --> 40:31.825
I was pretty convinced that it couldn't be so.

40:31.905 --> 40:32.726
I didn't feel bad.

40:32.786 --> 40:35.130
I didn't feel bad.

40:35.150 --> 40:39.095
So I did what I had to do with this.

40:39.976 --> 40:41.779
Yeah, I wrote...

40:42.012 --> 40:43.339
I wrote.

40:43.460 --> 40:45.150
I had no journalism.

40:45.351 --> 40:49.373
I had no contact, but I wrote fiction.

40:50.197 --> 40:53.202
The novels are still around.

40:53.342 --> 41:02.878
I have to say that reading three different stories simultaneously is no problem for me, because I read about six books simultaneously anyway.

41:02.898 --> 41:14.637
I have a program at night where I have a stack of four or five books that I'm working on, and I'll start off with something pleasant, and then I'll get on to something more slippery.

41:14.817 --> 41:15.799
You take me to bed?

41:15.779 --> 41:18.323
I take them to bed because we have a little battle.

41:18.343 --> 41:20.708
I have a little light now that focuses.

41:20.748 --> 41:21.188
That's right.

41:21.208 --> 41:22.611
I have to say it.

41:22.731 --> 41:24.234
I go to bed about nine.

41:24.574 --> 41:30.645
I go to bed about midnight, but I'll play with the kids for an hour and a half or so when I get home.

41:30.665 --> 41:31.707
I get two little girls.

41:33.309 --> 41:35.553
I'll read for five hours or so.

41:35.593 --> 41:36.916
That's right.

41:36.996 --> 41:41.263
Over the course of leaving, I'll probably pay attention to

41:41.834 --> 41:44.707
So this is no problem?

41:44.948 --> 41:48.503
No, I'm sure it's not, but it's no problem for me.

41:48.770 --> 42:06.182
But I was very glad when I got off reviewing fiction, I was reviewing fiction for various papers in Britain, but I was off it for a long time and as it were promoted, you know, to the writing of a solus, The Observer.

42:06.202 --> 42:08.025
Did you ever see The Observer?

42:08.286 --> 42:09.508
Very infrequently.

42:09.528 --> 42:12.313
It's a good, it's a Sunday paper.

42:12.293 --> 42:19.105
They gave me a book, you know, and I write 1,500 words on this one.

42:19.346 --> 42:27.661
But Punch, you know Punch, you've got to ask me to start doing some fiction, and I'm a glutton for punishment to start doing fiction again.

42:27.681 --> 42:29.164
I don't think I can do it much longer.

42:29.184 --> 42:30.245
I'm cheating too much.

42:30.266 --> 42:32.209
I'm not reading the whole book.

42:32.189 --> 42:48.308
some books some novels I can't read I don't have to I think a professional critic I was on a board three years ago for the American Book Awards general non-fiction they sent me

42:49.385 --> 42:54.591
187 books to judge and, you know, have four weeks to do it.

42:54.631 --> 42:55.772
Well, it's impossible.

42:55.872 --> 42:59.376
Not only is it... So do you feel a bit guilty at the end?

42:59.396 --> 43:00.017
I didn't.

43:00.057 --> 43:01.118
You can tell the quality.

43:01.178 --> 43:14.413
The way I rationalize it is that I would pay attention to every book, which means I may read the first half of one, but you know instantly a book that has no merit.

43:14.393 --> 43:26.709
Well, I mean, you know, I often feel that supposing you'd been given a copy of Ulysses in 1922, and, you know, like a fool, you'd never seen that album before.

43:26.729 --> 43:29.533
I mean, there are such people, you know, audiences for Ulysses.

43:29.553 --> 43:30.915
You're kidding me, right?

43:30.995 --> 43:41.329
Well, you know, you open the page, you know, you open that episode where Blumen sees the cabman's shelter, you know, and it's written in this ghastly...

43:41.883 --> 43:43.588
banal style.

43:43.608 --> 43:46.837
Mr. Joyce writes in a very banal style.

43:46.917 --> 43:50.507
Would you have said that, having encountered it for the first time, not having seen it?

43:50.528 --> 43:53.175
I think you would have said, this is so banal, it's brilliant.

43:53.915 --> 43:55.437
You would have recognized the brilliance.

43:55.457 --> 44:00.745
The recognition of the reality is so deliberate that there's a superb lacrossement of that.

44:00.785 --> 44:02.888
How was Ulysses recognized immediately?

44:02.908 --> 44:06.474
Well, in Britain, of course, it was mostly ignored.

44:06.494 --> 44:16.248
I mean, occasionally I look back at old volumes of TLS or Punshan, you know, whatever magazine is available.

44:16.268 --> 44:18.151
You were looking to make sure the tape was ignored.

44:18.171 --> 44:19.333
Yeah, quite right.

44:19.353 --> 44:20.935
Either the thing was ignored or the thing was ignored.

44:21.185 --> 44:25.690
dismissed in a few lines.

44:25.791 --> 44:29.135
The real reviews came here, of course, came out of the state.

44:29.155 --> 44:37.284
Well, the good review was by Edmund Wilson, isn't it?

44:37.304 --> 44:43.752
I think Wilson's review of Ulysses and of Finnegan's Wake are still the best, still the best.

44:43.772 --> 44:47.817
Strangely, it's still the best, despite the wealth of scholarships that come out.

44:47.982 --> 45:01.816
But I was looking at a review of Philip Hitchcock done by one of our pundits, a man I do test, called Malcolm Muggeridge.

45:01.836 --> 45:09.244
And I thought this was a totally evil review in that he said, I do not understand this book.

45:09.264 --> 45:11.827
I do not see why he wrote it, etc.

45:11.847 --> 45:17.753
And this was so much a non-review that I used.

45:18.712 --> 45:20.323
I don't think that's commissable.

45:20.343 --> 45:23.203
I mean, of course, Muglidge never realized.

45:23.858 --> 45:30.108
The time would come when you'd have books called Joyce, The Critical Heritage, and these things would be printed.

45:30.489 --> 45:38.321
There's a number of volumes of collections of critical... Okay, they just brought one out.

45:38.341 --> 45:45.132
I'm doing one in the Mocop, which is very, very... Yes, I've seen the Mocop one.

45:45.172 --> 45:49.599
He had some terrible reviews for Lolita in Britain, probably here too.

45:50.361 --> 45:51.182
Some of them are showing up.

45:51.652 --> 45:54.500
Have you read his lectures, which have been published?

45:54.520 --> 45:57.067
I've just been, yes, I've reviewed them, I think, without accepting.

45:57.087 --> 46:01.879
I've just been reviewing the new one, which I see in the bookshops.

46:02.180 --> 46:03.744
How are you enjoying them?

46:03.765 --> 46:05.830
Well, of course, I think we all...

46:06.299 --> 46:11.972
What he had to say was... He didn't think much of it as a work of art.

46:12.012 --> 46:13.215
No, he's right.

46:13.456 --> 46:15.922
No, what he says is totally right.

46:16.062 --> 46:21.675
He says that we all assume that Cervantes was a humanist who...
