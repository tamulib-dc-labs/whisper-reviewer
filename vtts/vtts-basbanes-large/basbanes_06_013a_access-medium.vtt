WEBVTT

00:02.663 --> 00:28.924
and believe it or not he used to mail me just through the mail these very rare pamphlets really he was quite a character apparently i've just heard from a second hand source at the earth credit society about brigham and hunting because huntington will be he was one of these collectors who bought on block of course and probably didn't know what he was buying probably

00:29.343 --> 00:30.184
Well, who knows?

00:30.284 --> 00:32.667
Well, someone is doing a life of Huntington.

00:32.787 --> 00:33.588
Yes, a Dickinson.

00:34.269 --> 00:41.477
And Dickinson talked to somebody at the Antiquarian Society, and he was very interested in some correspondence between Brigham and Huntington.

00:42.539 --> 00:57.076
Yeah, well, what happened is apparently some people in England did not want to sell any more things to Huntington, so there was correspondence that indicates that he used Brigham to buy stuff for him.

00:57.096 --> 00:58.658
I wonder if that was part of it.

00:59.583 --> 01:05.291
Because most of these great, like more of them, their great collections were formed by Claridge.

01:05.311 --> 01:05.632
Really?

01:06.653 --> 01:08.716
You had Dickinson's book on the collection.

01:08.737 --> 01:09.157
I do, yes.

01:09.377 --> 01:10.319
And the preceding book.

01:10.339 --> 01:12.742
And the canon book was very important.

01:12.762 --> 01:14.525
They were really formed by Claridge.

01:14.545 --> 01:16.608
So I'll tell you about some of the people I've talked to.

01:16.889 --> 01:19.613
It's really, it's very exciting.

01:19.673 --> 01:22.557
So half of the book will be history, of course.

01:23.819 --> 01:29.387
But I think the most exciting part, section, will be the contemporary people who haven't really

01:29.772 --> 01:31.595
been written about to a great extent.

01:31.615 --> 01:35.881
I mean, you have written about yourself, certainly, and everybody in the book all knows who you are.

01:36.823 --> 01:39.587
Well, certainly the second part will be the most avidly read.

01:39.667 --> 01:40.268
I think so.

01:40.368 --> 01:43.593
In fact, I was with Colin Franklin.

01:43.653 --> 01:46.457
He's wonderful.

01:46.658 --> 01:52.146
And he said, I should do an old book after I outlined what I was doing for him.

01:52.166 --> 01:54.189
And he said, you know, this history's been done.

01:54.209 --> 01:56.252
And I said, well, yeah, but

01:56.890 --> 02:26.880
other people don't know what it really hasn't been related and i am looking for a continuum i mean you say in your books um you give books new life i mean you pass them on people are just custodians for the moment so we're temporary so if we can kind of give some sense of this this renewal as a matter of fact one of the criticisms of the book of old and rare was why didn't you

02:27.367 --> 02:31.953
write about your American control, your colleagues.

02:32.093 --> 02:32.854
Well, we didn't.

02:33.715 --> 02:35.537
We purposely did.

02:36.879 --> 02:38.862
Well, it was a little difficult.

02:38.882 --> 02:40.684
That never even occurred to me, to be honest with you.

02:41.225 --> 02:41.825
Yeah, we did.

02:41.866 --> 02:42.647
We mentioned them.

02:43.047 --> 02:46.972
In the first edition, we mentioned some of them very long ways.

02:46.992 --> 02:56.344
But things happen, and there's a different relationship between a farm dealer where you're not as close.

02:56.932 --> 02:59.636
So you want to keep clean and clear.

02:59.656 --> 03:00.277
So we did.

03:00.817 --> 03:02.460
So somebody should mention them.

03:02.480 --> 03:05.864
And there are many worthy of being mentioned.

03:05.884 --> 03:07.727
With whom else have you worked?

03:07.787 --> 03:13.474
I spent a delightful afternoon with... I don't think this is online.

03:13.494 --> 03:14.936
That was the orthopedist.

03:15.597 --> 03:17.700
Well, we had a very interesting experience.

03:18.301 --> 03:19.783
Oh, this was years ago.

03:20.371 --> 03:27.161
And my father had been a physician, and about three months after he died, oh, whatever, doesn't that.

03:27.641 --> 03:29.244
And my leg bothered me very much.

03:29.304 --> 03:31.727
I wanted to see the sort of paper stuff in the bronze.

03:33.190 --> 03:36.354
And he was very nice, and blah, blah, blah, blah.

03:36.374 --> 03:40.680
And I said, Dr. Borstein, I would like your, you know, your fee.

03:40.700 --> 03:41.562
What do I owe you?

03:41.682 --> 03:42.563
What do I owe you?

03:42.583 --> 03:45.627
He said, I should charge the daughter of Dr. Rockford.

03:45.768 --> 03:46.969
Don't be ridiculous.

03:46.989 --> 03:48.792
He said, but I know you're in the book first.

03:49.953 --> 03:54.743
and send me, give me some books of my kibbutz.

03:54.783 --> 03:59.612
Well, he's not a kibbutz, he has established a long library in Nahariya.

03:59.712 --> 04:02.899
I said, well, it was a kibbutz.

04:02.919 --> 04:08.430
I said, Dr. Bernstein, we don't really have books, appropriate books.

04:08.510 --> 04:11.556
I mean, for kids to go with.

04:12.177 --> 04:14.602
He said, never mind, I'll be the judge of that.

04:14.622 --> 04:15.665
So what can I say?

04:15.685 --> 04:16.566
He's been very kind.

04:16.586 --> 04:17.549
And I said, well, come down.

04:17.569 --> 04:18.972
We'll go to the house in the Bronx.

04:19.292 --> 04:22.559
I said, come here.

04:22.579 --> 04:27.089
Well, Manny was ready to throw me out of the third floor window.

04:27.570 --> 04:30.777
He selected a 1548

04:31.330 --> 04:38.260
French deep grammar, another Renaissance book, and a very rare book book.

04:38.280 --> 04:41.926
Robinson Gate to the Holy Land, which we have.

04:41.946 --> 04:47.534
17th century English book, and then the Boudinot Star of Israel.

04:47.714 --> 04:48.475
Star of the West.

04:48.636 --> 04:53.743
Star of the West, a presentation copy to the President of the United States.

04:54.719 --> 04:58.663
I said, oh my God, why do we have all these good books?

04:58.803 --> 05:03.147
As adults, kids in a carboots, they want to read Gone with the Wind or something.

05:03.227 --> 05:07.571
Well, I said, it was not a matter of good.

05:07.751 --> 05:11.495
I said, Dr. Burton, I hope that they'll enjoy the blah blah blah.

05:11.515 --> 05:15.238
About six weeks later, he found these a massage room.

05:15.258 --> 05:20.103
My librarian wrote something, and he said, you know, these are wonderful books.

05:20.203 --> 05:21.964
They're not for a carboots.

05:21.984 --> 05:22.785
I sent them

05:23.238 --> 05:26.401
to the University of Jerusalem.

05:26.601 --> 05:29.764
And they're in the rare book room.

05:30.145 --> 05:31.966
We did our bit.

05:31.986 --> 05:33.528
We did our bit.

05:33.548 --> 05:35.490
I hope they're still there.

05:35.710 --> 05:37.051
Yeah, I hope they're still there.

05:37.071 --> 05:46.200
But, you know, the desire to acquire books is so insisting, especially among the Germans.

05:46.220 --> 05:52.266
I have found this, I have really found this in my study, in that

05:53.393 --> 06:08.766
A large percentage of the people, and I'm doing this not randomly, I'm not designing this by ethnic group or racial group or sex, but it's turning out that really an inordinate percentage of people I'm talking to are Jewish.

06:09.808 --> 06:13.917
And the Jews are the people of the book, it turns out, and the reverence of the book.

06:14.268 --> 06:17.433
It's really quite extraordinary.

06:17.513 --> 06:18.174
It's real.

06:18.354 --> 06:22.861
It was not that way for me when we began as young people.

06:22.881 --> 06:31.694
It used to be a custom among Jewish people, I don't know if you know this or not, to put a little honey on the book.

06:31.714 --> 06:33.096
I didn't know that.

06:33.216 --> 06:41.608
When my aunt taught me what we saw, and she said, I'm going to put a little honey on the book because writing is so sweet.

06:42.230 --> 06:44.934
And it's lovely.

06:45.055 --> 06:52.807
Well, young Aaron told me that when a book is really can't be used anywhere, they actually have funeral services.

06:52.867 --> 06:55.732
They have actually had a service.

06:57.575 --> 07:00.800
This is the New York Public Library.

07:00.820 --> 07:03.144
A few other libraries should hear about it.

07:03.544 --> 07:08.312
Instead of that, what they do is microfilm and then throw the original out.

07:08.432 --> 07:09.013
That's right.

07:09.905 --> 07:11.327
When I was at Oxford, it was interesting.

07:11.347 --> 07:12.870
We were talking about the Cervantes.

07:13.611 --> 07:14.733
I love this story.

07:15.735 --> 07:21.985
Well, remember at the last auction, where Quaritch paid a million and a half, not this Bradley Martin, but the garden sale.

07:23.307 --> 07:27.414
A million and a half, 1.65, and went back to Spain.

07:27.634 --> 07:32.622
So Julian Roberts at Oxford said, well, you know, we bought our Cervantes when it was issued.

07:33.108 --> 07:37.194
They had a book flyer in Spain.

07:37.534 --> 07:42.100
Have you any clue to Provo and Powers who's buying this book?

07:42.120 --> 07:43.322
Yes.

07:43.342 --> 07:45.104
Piri, I think.

07:45.125 --> 07:48.089
Robert Piri, who's sitting right behind me.

07:48.109 --> 07:48.850
That's my best deal.

07:48.870 --> 07:51.213
He's sitting right here with the group.

07:51.233 --> 07:51.994
P-I-R-I-E.

07:52.815 --> 07:57.381
He's president of the Rothschild Bank.

07:57.401 --> 08:00.786
And also Henri Schiller got the utopia.

08:01.188 --> 08:03.191
but he was over for the sale.

08:03.211 --> 08:05.033
There were four sitting in the Quaritch group.

08:05.093 --> 08:05.834
That's right.

08:05.874 --> 08:09.379
There was Arthur Freeman and Paul Wilson.

08:09.399 --> 08:11.562
And behind them were two men.

08:11.602 --> 08:15.587
One of them was Robert Peary, and the other one was Andre Schiller.

08:16.368 --> 08:18.651
Are they the English Schiller?

08:18.771 --> 08:19.793
Peary is American.

08:20.514 --> 08:21.195
Sure.

08:21.415 --> 08:22.737
And he's a big guy.

08:22.777 --> 08:24.639
In fact, I went up to him at the sale.

08:24.779 --> 08:27.343
Where is he located?

08:27.363 --> 08:28.424
Here.

08:28.444 --> 08:29.085
Here you are.

08:29.791 --> 08:40.990
But he has always, he's actually recently a member of the Rocksburg Court, along with Lady Echols.

08:41.171 --> 08:42.152
What did he draw?

08:42.292 --> 08:46.960
I believe, no I don't know, but I believe he brought the Shakespearean.

08:47.001 --> 08:49.184
Did they listen to the priest?

08:49.204 --> 08:50.787
The priest, perhaps.

08:51.442 --> 08:55.508
Well, when the bidding started, were you there?

08:55.528 --> 08:58.834
Because I was looking for you to, and I wanted to talk to you, and you left.

08:58.874 --> 09:00.376
But I walked right up to them.

09:00.837 --> 09:03.020
I stood as close to them as I'm standing.

09:03.160 --> 09:07.407
I mean, I wanted this particular... I know Richard Manning was interested in it.

09:07.427 --> 09:09.010
I talked to Richard Manning, by the way.

09:09.390 --> 09:11.594
He was the one who bought the Shakespeare's for $2 million.

09:12.315 --> 09:16.321
His dealer was Jim Cummins, who was sitting up in the balcony.

09:16.922 --> 09:18.124
So he dropped out.

09:18.847 --> 09:20.169
So I know it wasn't Manny.

09:20.249 --> 09:24.494
And then, of course, Quaritch won, and everybody was shaking hands, and Peary was shaking hands.

09:24.514 --> 09:25.335
Now, that's my guess.

09:25.395 --> 09:25.875
I don't know that.

09:25.895 --> 09:27.237
Well, I think it's a very educative.

09:27.257 --> 09:29.960
But I think it's probably who bought it.

09:29.980 --> 09:32.303
But Quaritch, how do you feel about this?

09:32.863 --> 09:34.625
Let's talk about that.

09:34.665 --> 09:37.309
I think it's a little bit of national noise.

09:37.329 --> 09:37.969
Well, sure.

09:37.989 --> 09:40.773
But on the other hand, these are books that belong in England.

09:40.813 --> 09:42.895
But I don't think they're all going back to England.

09:42.915 --> 09:44.817
See, I even have that in my notebook.

09:44.877 --> 09:45.478
I said, well,

09:45.644 --> 10:15.583
at least maybe england is bringing some of its national treasures back but i don't think that's really the case that's going to france that's going to france what i object to it is having these american millionaires uh billionaires uh instead of an american i've always objected it is rumored and i'll say this before machine if he bought home or bought from rosenberg was bought from quarish too but he bought a lot from rosenberg

10:16.272 --> 10:20.939
Well, this guy Peary, for instance, bought a lot from John Plummer.

10:20.959 --> 10:26.106
But when it came to auction, he always bought at auction and continues to buy through Quaritch.

10:26.247 --> 10:28.089
I think it discourages.

10:28.109 --> 10:29.852
It makes no sense.

10:29.872 --> 10:38.845
If you read, say, about the sale of the newspaper, and you're a young, hopeful buyer, collector, you withdraw.

10:38.865 --> 10:44.473
You say, ah, bunch of snobs, bunch of millionaires, I don't have a breath.

10:44.656 --> 10:46.679
Well, that's very expensive books.

10:46.739 --> 10:48.101
In general, you can say that.

10:48.221 --> 10:51.646
I think you two women have proved that you don't have to have.

10:51.926 --> 10:52.587
No, you don't.

10:52.707 --> 10:53.448
I don't have.

10:53.468 --> 10:56.793
What I have learned from your books is that you're both scholars.

10:57.534 --> 10:58.856
Very interesting books.

10:58.916 --> 11:02.762
When we came home, Leona said to me, oh, I wish we could have had.

11:02.782 --> 11:04.925
I said, 10 million to relax.

11:04.945 --> 11:12.556
And I said, you know, honestly, I am more excited by a much lesser book in which we can discover.

11:12.576 --> 11:13.617
Well, you know what excites me?

11:14.035 --> 11:17.110
When you talk about going to these basements in England,

11:17.647 --> 11:29.678
and discovering in a cellar, literally in a cellar, something that has... But this is something that you're using your knowledge and your perception.

11:29.718 --> 11:32.040
That to me is what collecting is.

11:32.060 --> 11:33.441
That's perception.

11:33.481 --> 11:34.322
That's the secret.

11:34.442 --> 11:37.805
I mean, this is one reason to collect, really.

11:38.666 --> 11:45.392
I'm more impressed by the guy who found Tamerlane for $15 in a pile of junk.

11:45.372 --> 11:51.203
than the guy who spent $200,000 for him, which happened to be picked Manny, by the way.

11:51.623 --> 11:53.427
You don't find him today.

11:53.928 --> 11:54.408
You can't.

11:54.449 --> 11:55.531
He did, though.

11:55.711 --> 11:58.376
And that could have been me, because I don't live very far from Murray.

11:58.436 --> 12:03.204
Look, it's not as possible as it used to be, but it's still possible.

12:03.225 --> 12:06.250
Look, you know, Manny's a great author to follow me.

12:06.837 --> 12:11.341
And we developed an orchid collection at one of the universities.

12:11.461 --> 12:13.363
Which university was that big?

12:13.383 --> 12:14.004
Brigham Young.

12:14.604 --> 12:20.130
And we were given a bid at, I think it was the way it was the Browning Law.

12:20.210 --> 12:21.751
At the other, the American Army Center.

12:21.771 --> 12:23.453
The January, so.

12:23.493 --> 12:29.118
The 2,000 for Flower Fables, which is Louise Orchid's first book.

12:29.138 --> 12:29.498
Okay.

12:29.518 --> 12:30.640
It's quite uncommon.

12:30.660 --> 12:32.401
Now, what happened, the university?

12:33.322 --> 12:36.405
You said bid up to 2,000.

12:37.837 --> 12:41.442
It went to 22 days.

12:41.462 --> 12:43.105
Of course, House B and me was commissioned.

12:44.147 --> 12:45.148
We didn't get it.

12:45.168 --> 12:51.518
So, right after New York, a young dealer came up and said, oh, I have a copy.

12:51.538 --> 12:52.960
Blah, blah, blah, blah, let you have it.

12:52.980 --> 12:53.761
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

12:53.781 --> 12:55.764
Little lad says, I have a copy.

12:56.024 --> 12:57.487
I have a copy.

12:57.507 --> 13:04.317
So, to make a long story short, we got the copy, and we told the librarian, who was delighted,

13:04.853 --> 13:06.977
You wouldn't have to pay the house fee, etc.

13:06.997 --> 13:07.638
That's nice.

13:08.139 --> 13:09.501
That's really exciting.

13:09.562 --> 13:11.024
We sent it to him.

13:11.044 --> 13:11.826
He had the book.

13:12.627 --> 13:14.631
He had the book.

13:14.931 --> 13:16.314
He had the book.

13:16.334 --> 13:19.379
The computer had medical stuff.

13:19.399 --> 13:22.224
Nothing had a case like that, though.

13:22.365 --> 13:24.729
We are such good friends.

13:25.290 --> 13:26.312
He volunteered.

13:26.472 --> 13:29.157
Nothing happened except that we said return the book.

13:29.575 --> 13:38.607
And he said, but I want to pay for it anyway, and when you sell the copy, then you'll remunerate me.

13:38.627 --> 13:43.313
And we said, no, we can't accept the book value and the money.

13:43.333 --> 13:44.854
It just goes against the grain.

13:45.375 --> 13:47.918
He said, tear being worse and return the book.

13:48.259 --> 13:59.413
And the moral is, virtue was rewarded, because I'm doing a lot of Louisa Orkett editorial work there with two men from the Carolinas,

14:00.035 --> 14:02.717
And I told the story to him.

14:02.898 --> 14:07.642
One of them is at the University of North Carolina in Charlotte, the English department.

14:08.323 --> 14:12.447
And he said, our library doesn't have it.

14:12.467 --> 14:14.749
And I would love it to be there.

14:15.129 --> 14:16.731
And then they buy it.

14:16.751 --> 14:17.751
So it works out.

14:17.772 --> 14:24.318
The moral of this, too, is, so wild fables cost quite a wonder.

14:24.338 --> 14:26.920
You could still find wild fables.

14:27.575 --> 14:36.483
in some sort of antique shop in Maine or New Hampshire.

14:36.503 --> 14:37.887
Looks like nothing.

14:37.927 --> 14:39.492
You could buy it for $2.

14:39.758 --> 14:44.486
Oh, and the dream on the cake was, I did a lovely article.

14:44.506 --> 14:45.347
She did a model.

14:45.387 --> 14:47.130
Because I got so interested in it.

14:47.150 --> 14:49.053
But the point is, it's acceptable.

14:49.073 --> 14:50.536
It doesn't come out.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.679
It'll be out in November in the A.B.

14:52.900 --> 14:53.741
when children are afraid.

14:53.881 --> 14:56.586
But this could happen when you say finding books.

14:56.666 --> 14:57.868
Excuse me just a minute.

14:57.848 --> 15:03.236
The story of the book is very exciting, and the publishers, nothing was known about the publishers.

15:03.576 --> 15:08.103
And I discovered that one of them got himself murdered here in New York.

15:08.123 --> 15:09.325
It makes a beautiful story.

15:09.345 --> 15:10.446
It makes a great story.

15:10.466 --> 15:12.970
So you're a detective, as you point out in the book, too.

15:13.010 --> 15:14.472
Yeah, well, that's the point.

15:14.772 --> 15:22.323
You see, finding early proof of books, a dealer today is scared to death, so he overcharges.

15:22.343 --> 15:25.628
You mind saying, Miss Dax, who knows very little,

15:26.485 --> 15:35.797
By chance, he finds a book printed in line in 1618, a Putin press book I'm referring to.

15:36.438 --> 15:39.723
He would be scared to death to price it as a sensible price.

15:39.743 --> 15:43.087
He would price it at $3,000, $4,000, $5,000.

15:43.247 --> 15:50.317
Because he thinks, he doesn't know what it is, but it must be great, it must be important because he printed in line in 1618.

15:50.337 --> 15:52.019
Lied in hundreds of books.

15:52.400 --> 15:54.282
You see, it used to be, when a dealer

15:54.413 --> 15:57.637
didn't know anything about a book, he would underpriced it.

15:57.797 --> 15:58.558
But he did.

15:58.578 --> 16:01.101
If he doesn't know anything about it, he underpriced it.

16:01.922 --> 16:07.228
And there are so many young dealers who really, I'm sorry to say, know very much.

16:07.248 --> 16:10.232
Well, they don't know the languages, and this is another hell.

16:10.272 --> 16:12.694
They have to deal in what?

16:12.875 --> 16:14.016
Englishlet or money?

16:14.236 --> 16:14.597
Englishlet first.

16:14.917 --> 16:17.100
What do you think about the new generation of dealers?

16:17.260 --> 16:18.782
Don't ask me.

16:18.942 --> 16:21.204
Well, a few of them are very good.

16:21.525 --> 16:24.268
There are a few who are very good scholars.

16:25.717 --> 16:35.691
But a lot of them, they take their cartons and they swept them from one fair to another.

16:35.711 --> 16:41.760
The only thing they change, the carton is in worse condition, and the prices are higher.

16:41.820 --> 16:47.488
Now, you two were quite instrumental in starting book fairs, which I think.

16:47.907 --> 16:50.190
I chaired the committee that started the group.

16:50.210 --> 16:55.476
Which I think has revolutionized book collecting to the point that more people now collect.

16:55.496 --> 17:01.103
In fact, I'm on the board of the Friends of Brother's Library, Clark, and we're having our first one next month.

17:01.123 --> 17:01.564
Where?

17:01.804 --> 17:02.806
At Clark University.

17:03.166 --> 17:05.068
Oh, sure.

17:05.088 --> 17:07.992
I'm some of the board up there.

17:08.258 --> 17:10.841
Do you know Mansa by his husband?

17:11.121 --> 17:12.082
I don't know him.

17:12.122 --> 17:13.423
He's a very knowledgeable one.

17:13.443 --> 17:14.004
He really is.

17:14.164 --> 17:15.285
He's very good.

17:16.386 --> 17:17.027
In his field.

17:17.047 --> 17:17.767
He's interesting books.

17:18.108 --> 17:22.472
He's better known outside of Worcester than he is in Worcester.

17:22.492 --> 17:26.096
When Worcester would collect and cannabulate him.

17:26.576 --> 17:27.537
But he's very good.

17:27.577 --> 17:30.280
And I will be doing a story on him.

17:31.261 --> 17:36.426
Anyway, let's talk about, if we could talk generally about your love for you.

17:37.115 --> 17:40.060
No, you don't collect yourselves, I don't think, do you?

17:40.702 --> 17:44.348
Well, we collect along the lines of what we happen to be writing.

17:44.669 --> 17:46.332
Like Francis Parkman, for instance.

17:46.432 --> 17:48.636
Well, I don't know what I'm saying.

17:48.656 --> 17:52.844
Now, Leona would collect Hook while she was working on the Hook book.

17:53.204 --> 17:55.849
I will collect Louise May Orton while I'm working on her.

17:56.285 --> 18:01.192
But then when we're through, we tend to get rid of those books to make room for all these.

18:01.212 --> 18:02.634
It's a question of space, too.

18:02.654 --> 18:04.476
So that we're not really collectors.

18:04.537 --> 18:07.120
We're really bastard collectors, I would say.

18:07.401 --> 18:11.646
So the satisfaction for the two of you, then, is what?

18:11.666 --> 18:13.569
In building collections for other people?

18:13.629 --> 18:16.473
Or making sure that the books are well taken care of?

18:16.493 --> 18:22.782
And finding interesting on common books.

18:23.268 --> 18:25.771
satisfying the needs of certain libraries.

18:25.791 --> 18:27.733
We're 90% libraries.

18:27.753 --> 18:33.460
You know, Morgan's old dictum, put the right book in the right place.

18:33.480 --> 18:34.901
And that's what we like to do.

18:35.442 --> 18:39.967
And we know the needs of certain libraries, and we try to build them.

18:39.987 --> 18:44.092
And try to develop other collectors.

18:44.112 --> 18:51.300
Do you ever kind of, you mentioned a lot of the great stuff is gone, but on the other hand,

18:52.141 --> 18:54.083
There must be new areas to collect.

18:54.123 --> 18:58.227
Now, you said one of your chapters here, feminism is collectable.

18:58.247 --> 19:04.053
Well, if there came a point, Lisa Baskin, who I interviewed, speaks to both of you.

19:04.073 --> 19:06.315
Lisa and Leonard .

19:06.355 --> 19:07.856
They're very good.

19:07.976 --> 19:09.338
I'm sure they are.

19:09.398 --> 19:12.161
They're wonderful, wonderful collection.

19:12.201 --> 19:15.184
They've never talked about their book.

19:15.304 --> 19:15.704
I'm sorry.

19:16.104 --> 19:18.146
They have enormous enthusiasm.

19:18.407 --> 19:21.810
I call them, they are my example of the synergistic

19:22.027 --> 19:48.203
collection of it because they really feed on each other to sit with them and to listen to the tape they actually finish each other's sentences and they in complete sentences it's almost like they anticipate each other's thoughts and you see this excitement and this enthusiasm and Leonard will talk about going to a fair or anywhere and seeing something which he has never heard of before but he knows instantly what it is

19:48.470 --> 19:50.913
and how important it is.

19:50.973 --> 19:56.659
You have to feel for it.

19:57.620 --> 20:15.478
If you see, since we had a Catholic art from Germany the day before yesterday, there were quite a few small items in it, but we knew that these items, we could mold them, that they are something we can use.

20:15.679 --> 20:18.021
It related to the Emperor Charles V.

20:18.170 --> 20:21.759
his coronation and procession and all that stuff.

20:22.120 --> 20:22.982
It makes a picture.

20:23.002 --> 20:27.654
It makes a story of Charles V. And this is what you have to feel.

20:27.674 --> 20:29.077
You have to have a feeling for a book.

20:29.418 --> 20:35.132
You can't just, I mean, you can go from catalog after catalog and you're left cold, but all of a sudden,

20:35.399 --> 20:35.980
There it is.

20:36.240 --> 20:38.723
Something jumps out and you have to make that connection.

20:39.523 --> 20:43.127
Making connections is the thing.

20:43.147 --> 20:44.028
That's it.

20:44.048 --> 20:45.250
This is what it's all about.

20:45.270 --> 20:47.612
Perception is another way of putting it.

20:47.632 --> 20:49.334
Connecting one thing with another.

20:49.354 --> 20:51.677
This is the excitement, really.

20:51.697 --> 20:52.538
And you get excited.

20:52.618 --> 20:56.522
And then you say, I know who will want that book.

20:56.582 --> 20:57.943
Is that kind of the thought?

20:57.964 --> 20:59.826
We have a pamphlet inside.

20:59.906 --> 21:01.187
It looks like nothing.

21:01.825 --> 21:03.667
And we opened it up, and there it was.

21:03.727 --> 21:04.648
We saw it immediately.

21:04.668 --> 21:06.610
It was by Cosina de' Medici.

21:06.670 --> 21:06.991
Really?

21:07.551 --> 21:10.374
And then it followed through in some of the great Florence.

21:10.715 --> 21:11.716
It's a reflection.

21:12.236 --> 21:20.065
It's a comparison of the learning of a 17th century French humanist with early humanists.

21:20.085 --> 21:22.067
And the whole picture is there.

21:22.448 --> 21:26.071
So it recreates two periods.

21:26.472 --> 21:29.275
And you can get as excited about it.

21:29.295 --> 21:29.956
It made a pamphlet.

21:30.016 --> 21:31.157
A little pamphlet.

21:31.475 --> 21:35.680
As you can about an illustrated folio, a gorgeous illustrated folio.

21:35.700 --> 21:37.222
Well, you mentioned the tracks.

21:37.582 --> 21:40.545
That's real.

21:41.306 --> 21:42.588
There we are.

21:42.668 --> 21:44.910
Matty was looking at a track the other day.

21:44.930 --> 21:47.593
It was written by somebody, Christopher of Portugal.

21:47.613 --> 21:48.434
We never heard of him.

21:48.454 --> 21:49.696
We found out who he was.

21:50.677 --> 21:57.104
Apparently, he met with Elizabeth and his voice.

21:57.345 --> 22:00.368
So the book is great and great.

22:00.685 --> 22:03.169
That's a tiny little segment.

22:03.189 --> 22:05.152
Well, it's a fragment of history, isn't it?

22:05.172 --> 22:06.674
Yes, the Armada.

22:06.734 --> 22:08.376
He mentioned all of this.

22:08.416 --> 22:09.939
Where did you find all this?

22:10.439 --> 22:13.404
We had ordered this from a French catalog.

22:13.644 --> 22:15.988
But I mean, then how did you make the historic connections?

22:16.008 --> 22:17.229
Well, we did it.

22:17.690 --> 22:18.972
Oh, but you did your research.

22:19.052 --> 22:19.352
We did.

22:19.673 --> 22:21.255
We were reading.

22:21.375 --> 22:26.122
And she was leaving through it, and these names hopped out.

22:26.944 --> 22:28.566
Wally, Drake.

22:29.457 --> 22:31.239
You don't mean anything more.

22:31.339 --> 22:33.221
That's a big apple.

22:33.241 --> 22:34.843
Contemporary reference, yeah.

22:35.424 --> 22:37.266
It's just as we had a pamphlet.

22:38.408 --> 22:41.691
And we're looking and looking, and I see the name Draco.

22:41.852 --> 22:43.894
It's an Italian name, Draco.

22:45.656 --> 22:47.839
Where's Draco?

22:47.859 --> 22:51.563
The Spaniards said, it's Drake.

22:51.583 --> 22:54.807
And it was all about the treatment of the Indians

22:55.411 --> 22:59.817
in Spanish America.

23:00.137 --> 23:16.177
This was the Americana and the treatment, or the barbarians, the treatments of the Indians by the Spanish in Mexico or wherever, in Central America.

23:16.578 --> 23:22.465
So these little things, to rehearse in the cutable is important.

23:22.951 --> 23:26.376
What can you say about Thomas Wines that hasn't been said?

23:26.396 --> 23:27.718
Probably something.

23:27.738 --> 23:33.447
Oh, the Nuremberg Chronicle that hasn't been said.

23:33.688 --> 23:36.071
I mean, Shakespeare folio never hasn't been said.

23:36.092 --> 23:40.098
Only Shakespeare folio, but everything has been said.

23:40.118 --> 23:41.500
That's right.

23:41.520 --> 23:42.582
Well, you know what I've seen?

23:42.722 --> 23:43.443
It's stated.

23:43.543 --> 23:49.853
Almost as recently as this morning, because I was coming down, and I had a little time, and I went through the haven,

23:50.339 --> 23:57.665
I went through the Beinecke, of course, and I'll be doing my interviews there shortly, and I went over to see the Child Passive Exhibit, which is wonderful.

23:58.146 --> 24:02.589
But, you know, I saw perhaps my seventh Gutenberg Bible of the last two months.

24:02.770 --> 24:03.470
You know, I saw it.

24:03.710 --> 24:19.924
I've been to Texas, and of course I've seen the one at Harvard, and I've handled Mr. Scheide's, and I've seen the one at the British Library, and I've seen it in the New York public, and everybody's got a Gutenberg Bible on that, as wonderful as it was.

24:20.292 --> 24:21.974
I'm not belittling it in any way.

24:23.096 --> 24:24.818
Well, it is.

24:24.858 --> 24:28.584
But everybody certainly knows the value and the importance of the Gutenberg Bible.

24:29.305 --> 24:33.371
I'm really impressed when you make discoveries that haven't been made.

24:33.811 --> 24:35.233
Well, that's the point.

24:35.554 --> 24:36.815
That's the point.

24:36.835 --> 24:40.000
That's the point, as far as we're concerned.

24:40.020 --> 24:47.831
I mean, to deal in modern firsts, the importance of H30 with a drop of J, I find an awful bore.

24:47.851 --> 24:49.894
But it's the easiest thing for a Gutenberg.

24:50.161 --> 24:58.771
young dealer who has no foreign background, no language training, he cannot manage early books.

24:58.791 --> 25:00.514
You have to have training.

25:01.134 --> 25:07.762
And I've always said that a dealer, to be a good dealer, you should have more French.

25:08.363 --> 25:16.573
You should be exposed to books just as a young intern is exposed to medicine before he starts out.

25:17.819 --> 25:20.903
He has to be grown into medicine.

25:20.923 --> 25:22.604
You can have all the fancy training.

25:22.685 --> 25:29.352
Look, I had a marvelous education, but I didn't know books until I had a very stern teacher.

25:29.592 --> 25:30.974
Well, you called it Siberian.

25:31.014 --> 25:31.495
It was Siberian.

25:31.515 --> 25:34.478
For a race for a grad, it sure was.

25:34.498 --> 25:40.445
But involuntarily, I was exposed so much.

25:40.525 --> 25:41.366
I've been an idiot.

25:42.107 --> 25:44.149
Look, I studied in Straussburg.

25:44.169 --> 25:47.573
I worked for my PhD, but it was with the book.

25:48.329 --> 25:53.094
And from Reischner, Fingerspitzengefühl, that really made me a ramble.

25:54.275 --> 25:56.417
What was that expression you just said?

25:56.437 --> 25:58.179
Fingerspitzengefühl.

25:58.199 --> 26:00.141
It's the feeling at your fingertips.

26:00.161 --> 26:01.162
Electricity in the fingertips.

26:01.182 --> 26:02.143
Your fingertips.

26:02.303 --> 26:04.445
How would you spell it?

26:04.505 --> 26:06.507
That's a good question.

26:06.527 --> 26:08.649
Fingerspitzen is one word.

26:08.669 --> 26:10.151
F-I-N-G-E-R.

26:11.312 --> 26:11.432
Okay.

26:11.472 --> 26:12.553
That's one word.

26:12.853 --> 26:15.636
S-P-I-T-Z-E-N.

26:16.392 --> 26:21.717
G-E, I don't know about that.

26:22.397 --> 26:23.899
G-E-F-U-E-H-L.

26:24.239 --> 26:24.740
Okay.

26:24.920 --> 26:26.481
It's the end of the end.

26:27.042 --> 26:27.942
You bring it to it.

26:28.283 --> 26:30.405
Your sensation, it really is.

26:30.965 --> 26:31.806
That's very important.

26:31.946 --> 26:37.571
I know if I come to it and... It could take me a day to figure out.

26:37.591 --> 26:46.399
It's what happens when you spy a book that either you know it's exciting and the other dealer doesn't, or you have

26:46.582 --> 26:50.467
It's a sudden feeling you're going to find something like that, but it's almost an odd-called feeling.

26:51.868 --> 27:05.285
I mean, you said to yourself, there must be a mention, say, of the Pilgrims, or the Armada, or whatever, or... I want to show you just how you felt it.

27:05.305 --> 27:12.113
So it is your feeling, then, that there are still many, many, many great things out there remaining to be discovered.

27:12.133 --> 27:12.374
Excuse me.

27:12.394 --> 27:13.235
Would you agree with that?

27:14.176 --> 27:15.998
I don't know whether there's...

27:16.687 --> 27:24.114
I'm sure there are still that you can still prowl around in small French towns and find stuff.

27:24.134 --> 27:25.295
I don't know about Paris.

27:26.015 --> 27:32.061
We just bought five very interesting books from a French dealer in Tours.

27:32.621 --> 27:38.387
Now, we haven't even opened the Kings movies, but they all look delicious.

27:39.107 --> 27:41.589
There will be stuff in them.

27:41.609 --> 27:44.432
Two of them we've had, but the others look very good.

27:45.020 --> 27:47.303
And I'm sure there's stuff going on.

27:47.423 --> 27:48.604
I know there's stuff going on.

27:48.625 --> 27:54.492
So you're kind of buying this on a hunch, then, that there's going to be stuff going on.

27:54.512 --> 27:56.675
Well, you have to be a gambler.

27:56.695 --> 27:58.917
I mean, we know a very good young dealer.

27:59.318 --> 28:01.200
This dealer will not take a chance.

28:01.621 --> 28:03.403
You have to take a chance.

28:03.443 --> 28:06.287
You have to be a sport.

28:06.347 --> 28:07.188
What would I say?

28:07.228 --> 28:10.492
Not a gambler, but you have to risk.

28:10.512 --> 28:12.154
You have to risk your money.

28:12.174 --> 28:14.537
I mean...

28:14.872 --> 28:20.982
Now, you mentioned that your primary work is with libraries and institutions.

28:21.002 --> 28:31.681
Now, do they come to you and say, we're trying to develop a collection here, or we're looking for titles, or do they just kind of depend on you to tell them what you have?

28:31.801 --> 28:35.968
One way or the other, we may suggest, why don't you start a collection

28:36.235 --> 28:43.685
of all deans, or why don't you start a collection of Louisa Mayorka?

28:43.705 --> 28:44.787
Would you be interested?

28:45.247 --> 28:53.499
Now, if they've got a good education department or a pedagogical one of it, they would be interested in that.

28:53.939 --> 28:58.526
And as it turned out, Brigham Young was interested, and they have a wonderful collection.

28:58.926 --> 29:05.415
First editions, angry prints, secondary sources, autographed letters,

29:05.817 --> 29:11.123
Would you say that this came largely as a result of your suggesting to them?

29:11.544 --> 29:12.925
I would say so.

29:13.206 --> 29:16.470
Who would I talk to there?

29:16.590 --> 29:19.653
Could I call somebody there and have them talk?

29:20.234 --> 29:22.277
Absolutely, Dean Larson.

29:22.297 --> 29:25.961
Mr. A. Dean Larson, the L-A-R-S-E-N.

29:26.021 --> 29:28.444
He's head of special collections.

29:28.464 --> 29:29.645
Well, he's more than that.

29:30.286 --> 29:33.630
He's assistant director of the library, actually.

29:33.965 --> 29:40.035
But he's a darling, and he will certainly vouch for it.

29:40.055 --> 29:43.201
What I want is to have him say, yes, we wouldn't have this.

29:43.221 --> 29:45.224
He doesn't talk, though.

29:45.404 --> 29:46.627
No, he might.

29:46.727 --> 29:50.052
Oh, you never know.

29:50.092 --> 29:54.280
This is an issue of Frank Leslie's illustration.

29:54.300 --> 29:55.482
And that's 1886, isn't it?

29:55.562 --> 29:55.922
1866.

29:55.942 --> 29:56.884
1866.

29:57.320 --> 30:03.329
And this is an anonymous story that I happen to know.

30:03.570 --> 30:04.972
It's by Louisa Mayorka.

30:05.012 --> 30:10.581
The title is The Freak of a Genius, Chapter 5, A Double Danger.

30:10.601 --> 30:20.256
If I see this, I get just as excited as if somebody else... Now, where did you find this?

30:21.485 --> 30:23.988
And I found this, but I think it was in a bus fair.

30:24.108 --> 30:24.549
Really?

30:24.649 --> 30:24.829
Yeah.

30:25.010 --> 30:28.995
Now, how did you know it was Louisa Bell?

30:29.295 --> 30:29.616
That's it.

30:29.716 --> 30:30.397
She knows.

30:31.238 --> 30:33.060
Now, I was saying, I would say this.

30:33.341 --> 30:36.124
Say, not a place like The Young Young, but they know what they have.

30:36.445 --> 30:44.115
But say a young library, say one of the branch libraries of Berkeley, California.

30:44.135 --> 30:48.100
Say they had a pile of early printed books all over the place.

30:48.907 --> 30:50.269
in special collections.

30:50.329 --> 30:55.036
They have books in French, they have books in German.

30:55.096 --> 30:56.598
They have books.

30:56.618 --> 30:58.280
They're rare books.

30:58.300 --> 31:12.621
But if you can direct their cataloguing and arranging these rare books, say they have in French books 25 published by the firm of Estienne, which is a great French printer.

31:12.641 --> 31:18.289
If you can help assemble an Estienne book, if they have enough material

31:18.556 --> 31:23.323
they will then begin to branch out and specialize in different segments.

31:23.343 --> 31:26.308
And to do it in an imaginative way.

31:26.648 --> 31:27.890
Or they have Luther.

31:27.910 --> 31:31.896
Say they have 20 books on the German Reformation.

31:31.956 --> 31:34.019
Say 20 books of Luther.

31:34.079 --> 31:40.048
They will begin to see the light and say, well, we have a Reformation collection.

31:40.609 --> 31:42.011
And we want to develop it now.

31:42.592 --> 31:44.815
They can feed us.

31:45.196 --> 31:47.179
So they'll go off on that tangent.

31:48.374 --> 31:55.764
Come to them cold, some universities, a University of Winnipeg or something, with dirty books on the recognition.

31:56.004 --> 32:00.550
They may be interested in capital or something.

32:00.570 --> 32:02.813
If they keep your books on the recognition.

32:02.833 --> 32:16.812
But they have to have some familiarity, because a lot of universities, librarians or assistant librarians, they don't know over much the middle of a bad way to draw.

32:16.994 --> 32:28.166
I just saw an item in the Hampshire Gazette, which is out in Western Massachusetts, and there's a dealer out there, and I can't recall his name, and I'm an overly, well, it's interesting.

32:28.306 --> 32:35.373
I mean, I don't approve of nuclear weapons.

32:35.654 --> 32:38.356
No, and nor does he, but he thought it was a collection.

32:38.376 --> 32:39.137
But it is a collection.

32:39.357 --> 32:41.380
But I think a couple of dealers have done that.

32:41.480 --> 32:44.723
Now, since Breger at the AAS has told me about

32:45.142 --> 32:47.825
a guy he worked for out in Sacramento, and I can remember his name.

32:47.845 --> 32:52.150
He was a big, big man with about 380 pounds, I don't know who he is.

32:52.170 --> 32:57.075
But he decided out in the West Coast, Sacramento, California, I think.

32:58.056 --> 33:00.178
Right, that's not important.

33:00.198 --> 33:08.347
But he did decide that nobody had ever collected all of these pulp magazines, which are spin-offs, from TV sitcoms.

33:09.468 --> 33:13.933
And so he put this thing together and sold it to, like, the University of New Mexico.

33:14.099 --> 33:20.149
Well, it's the grandchild of the darn novel, I know.

33:20.350 --> 33:23.135
Do you want to take your jacket off?

33:23.275 --> 33:24.737
No, I'm not fine, thank you.

33:24.797 --> 33:29.926
Mary and I did the introduction to a book published by Macmillan on Special Collections.

33:31.930 --> 33:34.995
And we were not the editors, we just did the instructions.

33:35.015 --> 33:39.162
The editors got all the information, all the slides,

33:39.479 --> 33:46.672
Well, we just couldn't believe the things that people... This was a book... One on Arabian horses.

33:46.732 --> 33:48.515
We have just one copy.

33:48.575 --> 33:49.176
That's fine.

33:49.356 --> 33:50.598
I'm doing all my stuff.

33:51.139 --> 33:51.500
One.

33:51.520 --> 33:52.882
They have copies of everything.

33:52.902 --> 33:55.547
What were they collecting on Arabian horses?

33:55.567 --> 33:56.388
No kidding.

33:56.409 --> 34:00.756
I mean, it's just California with all the nonsense.

34:00.776 --> 34:01.858
Was this kind of a textbook?

34:02.429 --> 34:04.892
This is a good reference book.

34:04.952 --> 34:06.193
We can't get it now.

34:06.233 --> 34:08.075
We're talking about it a little bit.

34:08.095 --> 34:10.618
Well, we can't get it, but they can.

34:10.818 --> 34:11.499
But I could buy it.

34:12.080 --> 34:13.161
I just want to see the title of it.

34:14.863 --> 34:15.143
Oh.

34:15.183 --> 34:18.407
Special Collections and Colleges and University Libraries.

34:18.467 --> 34:19.868
When was it published?

34:20.009 --> 34:20.889
Last year.

34:20.910 --> 34:21.030
88.

34:21.070 --> 34:23.212
88 of the college.

34:23.653 --> 34:25.174
Special Collections and Colleges.

34:26.716 --> 34:27.677
Yeah, Macmillan.

34:28.872 --> 34:29.192
89.

34:29.212 --> 34:32.255
89, and we did it in 88.

34:32.295 --> 34:35.197
You had no idea what it was collected.

34:35.338 --> 34:36.559
I think I need this book.

34:36.799 --> 34:39.861
What does it cost out of curiosity?

34:39.881 --> 34:40.382
$90.

34:40.402 --> 34:41.263
I can get it.

34:41.283 --> 34:42.584
I mean, when you think of it.

34:42.604 --> 34:43.485
I can get these for cost.

34:43.565 --> 34:47.888
Just the specialist list of the, do you have the ABAA?

34:47.908 --> 34:48.189
Yes.

34:48.509 --> 34:51.832
You have it, then you just look at the back, what do you list?

34:51.852 --> 34:53.273
Specialized.

34:53.293 --> 34:56.176
This would be very interesting for me to find out.

34:56.196 --> 34:57.917
Well, it's non-comprehensive.

34:58.150 --> 35:01.875
A lot of big libraries did not answer the question they had.

35:01.935 --> 35:05.079
They didn't want to be bothered.

35:05.199 --> 35:08.263
I don't think Harvard did.

35:08.283 --> 35:10.506
But I know what they collect anyway.

35:10.526 --> 35:15.733
But you know what they don't hear.

35:16.153 --> 35:20.479
But a lot of small libraries answered.

35:21.134 --> 35:22.755
books on coconuts.

35:22.836 --> 35:26.819
I mean, I'm being sarcastic, but that's about the size.

35:26.839 --> 35:30.463
There was another... Well, official collections in colleges and universities.

35:30.483 --> 35:34.807
Yes, that we did an introduction for from Macmillan that might interest you.

35:34.827 --> 35:36.268
Okay, your names are on there.

35:36.328 --> 35:38.750
Who was the editor on that, by the way?

35:38.770 --> 35:41.613
Well, a place called M-O-G-A-R-K.

35:41.993 --> 35:43.214
M-O-G-A-R-K.

35:43.655 --> 35:46.597
Burgess, B-U-R-G-E-S-S.

35:46.617 --> 35:49.000
He's in Santa Monica.

35:49.280 --> 35:50.601
I think my teacher...

35:51.779 --> 35:56.443
That's very useful.

35:57.464 --> 36:01.268
I can get books at first.

36:01.288 --> 36:02.609
I think I have that.

36:02.649 --> 36:04.691
That's a Macmillan book.

36:05.332 --> 36:06.753
Yeah, I have that.

36:06.773 --> 36:09.376
And some of these profiles are interesting.

36:09.396 --> 36:10.176
Yeah, I have that.

36:11.778 --> 36:21.567
But the new breed of dealers, they're few very good ones, but most of them.

36:22.677 --> 36:34.992
Who were some of the... Well, you know, when I interviewed Ed Wolfe, I went to Philadelphia, and he worked for Rosenbach, of course, and he was related to him.

36:35.713 --> 36:43.742
He was kind of groomed to be the successor, and of course, then he had the falling out with Philip, of course.

36:44.163 --> 36:46.045
Well, I saw him in January, he looked wonderful.

36:46.085 --> 36:49.309
He was ill, but when I saw him in January, he looked wonderful.

36:49.508 --> 36:54.136
But he did say that he thought that Krauss was more knowledgeable than Rosenbach.

36:54.156 --> 36:57.242
And I've told people that they can't believe they would say that.

36:57.422 --> 37:01.369
I think Krauss probably was a little more knowledgeable surgeon.

37:01.489 --> 37:03.954
But not an American.

37:04.174 --> 37:04.955
No way.

37:05.617 --> 37:07.440
He might have done well with Krauss.

37:08.081 --> 37:08.381
No.

37:08.962 --> 37:09.904
You don't think so, huh?

37:10.064 --> 37:11.567
I think that Rosenbach...

37:11.733 --> 37:15.738
Look, Rosenbach knew his English literature and American literature.

37:15.758 --> 37:16.519
His PhD in English literature.

37:16.539 --> 37:17.140
And that's earned.

37:17.180 --> 37:18.682
People don't realize it.

37:18.882 --> 37:21.165
Dr. Oh, there's no doubt about it.

37:21.626 --> 37:23.168
His PhD was earned, you know.

37:23.248 --> 37:24.890
Oh, yes, it was earned.

37:25.090 --> 37:25.991
He earned it.

37:26.071 --> 37:26.692
He earned it.

37:26.812 --> 37:27.734
Certainly earned it.

37:27.754 --> 37:29.556
I love that story.

37:31.098 --> 37:32.660
Yeah, that's a great story.

37:33.261 --> 37:34.642
It wasn't a great story.

37:34.663 --> 37:37.386
No, I mean, that man just never relented, did he?

37:37.771 --> 37:39.756
Oh, it was one day?

37:39.796 --> 37:42.843
No, there was no way to attempt to make him relate.

37:43.544 --> 37:53.046
She was asked, when she came up again, you know, and the whole thing was renewed, why didn't you change your supervisor as you were today?

37:53.735 --> 37:58.561
Well, you couldn't possibly change your supervisor.

37:58.661 --> 38:01.244
You had a supervisor, you didn't like him, you weren't.

38:01.264 --> 38:02.425
That's right, you're stuck.

38:02.465 --> 38:03.146
Well, whatever.

38:03.206 --> 38:05.989
But you must have had a little stubbornness in you, too, though.

38:06.009 --> 38:07.251
Oh, I was difficult.

38:07.371 --> 38:08.993
I was a fresh kid.

38:09.133 --> 38:13.859
And I wanted to do what I wanted to do.

38:13.879 --> 38:20.907
Actually, the way it turned down... Now, my parents, of course, were very sad, and, of course, I went through a lot.

38:21.697 --> 38:30.473
If I had gotten a degree at the time, I probably would have toured media history in some small town in Oklahoma.

38:30.573 --> 38:33.599
In Mississippi.

38:33.879 --> 38:34.741
Very homesick.

38:34.761 --> 38:38.688
In my life would have been that a small town that I do.

38:38.808 --> 38:41.593
I think that ultimately you would have come to Brooksville.

38:41.613 --> 38:42.214
Do you think so?

38:42.274 --> 38:42.675
I don't think so.

38:42.993 --> 38:45.577
I never would have landed in the local business.

38:45.777 --> 38:47.039
This was no sportsman.

38:47.320 --> 38:50.505
Well, I love this story about the stationary and the welcome sign.

38:50.545 --> 38:55.092
Well, the way it turned out, it turned out marvelous.

38:55.112 --> 38:57.656
I didn't know it at the time.

38:57.676 --> 39:00.140
And it was really awful that the U.S.

39:00.160 --> 39:06.891
Paul put to this then head of manuscripts on American history at the A.P.A.

39:06.911 --> 39:10.857
Publisher that's a dolly man, and he was very sorry about it.

39:11.461 --> 39:15.267
And he told me about Rajni.

39:15.287 --> 39:16.348
He said, this guy needs a job.

39:17.310 --> 39:18.411
He needs somebody.

39:18.431 --> 39:18.912
He needs somebody.

39:18.932 --> 39:19.252
He's a refugee.

39:20.634 --> 39:34.134
And then when I went up to Rajni, his English was very haughty at the time, I said, well, I do speak German.

39:34.154 --> 39:36.017
Of course, we've done it tremendously.

39:36.453 --> 39:42.419
But unfortunately, I lit a cigarette, and I didn't do anything.

39:42.439 --> 39:43.500
But you couldn't smoke.

39:43.641 --> 39:48.626
Well, I've been describing you to people who are really interested in my book and what I'm talking to you.

39:48.646 --> 39:53.871
And I say that you two were practicing feminists 20 or 30 years before the word .

39:53.891 --> 40:00.018
We were discussing this yesterday.

40:00.158 --> 40:06.004
One woman I work with claims that the word feminist actually has a history

40:06.541 --> 40:11.649
I think in its current news, it really is within the last 50 or 20 years.

40:11.750 --> 40:16.858
I think so, but maybe she meant the theory had it.

40:16.918 --> 40:19.482
Yeah, but she signed a few with it.

40:19.503 --> 40:20.745
But they were suffragettes.

40:20.845 --> 40:22.127
I mean, that was another word.

40:22.147 --> 40:23.229
That was a whole other different thing.

40:23.249 --> 40:30.381
Not the only thing they were struggling for, although it's... There were basic rights in those days, not just... Property rights, in a way.

40:30.401 --> 40:32.464
I mean, basic human rights.

40:34.013 --> 40:38.037
But you look at the books that you've written.

40:38.057 --> 40:44.925
Well, Marvel has written about 23 biographies and more weeks.

40:44.965 --> 40:48.148
Well, you've done a lot of work up in my neck of the woods, I noticed.

40:48.228 --> 41:00.021
In fact, I have the Concord Public Library's deaccession copy of Dickens Goodly Romania.

41:00.575 --> 41:01.196
Oh, really?

41:01.216 --> 41:04.400
Which amazes me why they would deaccession that, you know?

41:04.420 --> 41:06.043
Well, it doesn't really follow me.

41:06.063 --> 41:12.291
Well, but it kind of, it kind of thrills me that maybe, you know, who might have handled that?

41:12.371 --> 41:15.135
That's true.

41:15.215 --> 41:25.830
I have a deaccession copy of the Portsmouth, New Hampshire Public Library's copy of House of the Seven Gables.

41:25.850 --> 41:26.371
That's wonderful.

41:26.751 --> 41:29.014
And that's five dollars for it.

41:29.034 --> 41:29.535
That's true.

41:30.190 --> 41:37.881
Well, my first biography was The Life of Margaret Fuller, and that's going to be reprinted with the editions.

41:39.323 --> 41:43.029
Let's go back to the Frank Wesley thing now.

41:43.069 --> 41:43.650
How do you know?

41:43.730 --> 41:45.693
Well, that's a wonderful story, really.

41:45.813 --> 41:55.287
I don't mean to steal it away from you, but... When we were working, when I was doing a biography of Louisa May-Alfit, that was my second biography.

41:56.482 --> 41:57.563
Leona helped me.

41:57.583 --> 42:00.227
She took time off from Reischner to help me.

42:00.247 --> 42:02.510
We went to Harvard.

42:02.530 --> 42:10.580
Oh, but before that, we had visited Carol Wilson, a great professor of Orkin and others.

42:11.401 --> 42:13.143
Now, where was Wilson from?

42:13.443 --> 42:15.286
Carol Atwood Wilson.

42:15.406 --> 42:16.828
And where was she from?

42:16.848 --> 42:17.268
Yeah.

42:17.288 --> 42:18.450
But where was she from?

42:18.510 --> 42:21.493
He was from Carol.

42:21.994 --> 42:23.216
He was from New York.

42:23.396 --> 42:25.138
He was an attorney.

42:25.473 --> 42:30.561
He was also a Guggenheim trustee, which is part of the story.

42:30.701 --> 42:35.328
And he was a fine collector, fine scholar.

42:35.348 --> 42:36.550
Anyway, we visited him.

42:36.610 --> 42:38.713
He showed us his treasures.

42:38.733 --> 42:45.283
And as we left, he said, Mr. Stern, you should get yourself a Guggenheim fellowship.

42:45.303 --> 42:49.649
Remember, he was a trustee to finish your biography.

42:49.910 --> 42:50.190
And Ms.

42:50.250 --> 42:54.096
Rastendale said to me, I know you're interested in written history.

42:54.869 --> 43:01.738
And we all suspect that Louisa Mayorka wrote sensational thrillers under some pseudonym.

43:02.819 --> 43:05.682
Find out the pseudonym and find the stories.

43:06.784 --> 43:08.226
So that was in the back of our minds.

43:08.246 --> 43:16.596
We went up to Harvard, and we were going through these mountains of family paintings there.

43:16.616 --> 43:18.338
Leona's got one pile in front of her.

43:18.358 --> 43:20.140
I have a pile in front of her.

43:20.160 --> 43:22.243
And all of a sudden, in this silent,

43:22.493 --> 43:25.036
sacrosanct atmosphere.

43:27.018 --> 43:32.525
She had come upon five letters from an Austin publisher, two dearness authors.

43:32.825 --> 43:36.550
We would like more stories from you under the pseudonym of A.M.

43:36.610 --> 43:41.275
Barnard or any other man's name you want to take.

43:41.676 --> 43:47.923
Stories like Behind the Mask or A Woman's Power, V.V.

43:48.103 --> 43:51.167
or The Marvel Woman, etc., etc., etc.

43:51.502 --> 43:54.646
Waiting for you to go and find it.

43:55.127 --> 43:55.527
Right there.

43:55.607 --> 43:57.990
Nobody had ever looked at it.

43:58.791 --> 44:05.220
If they had, I think that Cheney knew about it, but that she, of course, turned it down.

44:05.280 --> 44:08.143
Everything had to be a whole sensation for her.

44:08.564 --> 44:13.290
This was not in the image of America's best loved author of juvenile.

44:13.760 --> 44:15.082
Isn't that fascinating?

44:15.102 --> 44:19.347
So, with the name of his jams, the flag of IU here.

44:19.367 --> 44:23.493
There are lots of little incidents involved here that I don't want to go into.

44:23.613 --> 44:25.035
I published an article.

44:25.175 --> 44:28.740
Leona Grotian wrote, which appeared in the B.S.A.

44:28.760 --> 44:33.005
papers, announcing that this was the author's pseudonym.

44:33.046 --> 44:37.571
She reprinted the letters, and she named the stories.

44:37.672 --> 44:42.518
And all of a sudden, these things become very collectible, don't they?

44:42.920 --> 44:44.141
Oh, wow.

44:44.161 --> 44:47.104
And Carol Atwood Wilson applauded.

44:47.144 --> 44:48.104
He was delighted.

44:48.705 --> 44:52.428
And a lot of scholars said, what a nice piece of work.

44:52.448 --> 44:57.633
And there, for 30 years, it rested that article in the BSA papers.

44:57.653 --> 45:01.836
No, the BSA... I can get a copy of this.

45:01.856 --> 45:03.558
I can get this in harmony.

45:03.798 --> 45:07.581
I think Leona maybe has an extra copy for you.

45:08.002 --> 45:08.442
I may have.

45:08.462 --> 45:10.364
Don't worry about it.

45:10.384 --> 45:11.965
Yeah, the story's wonderful.

45:13.717 --> 45:18.141
Nobody pursued it.

45:18.982 --> 45:20.403
Leona didn't pursue it.

45:20.984 --> 45:22.005
I didn't pursue it.

45:22.345 --> 45:23.346
I didn't pursue it.

45:24.187 --> 45:30.253
My biography came out mentioning this, but just mentioning it.

45:31.894 --> 45:36.298
And then we had read some of these stories and realized how damned they were.

45:36.338 --> 45:37.900
You talk about feminism.

45:38.080 --> 45:43.285
Behind a mask or a woman's power, this is feminism emblazoned.

45:44.260 --> 45:51.889
And Vivi was such a horrible, evil woman, but she triumphs in the end.

45:52.010 --> 45:53.111
Wonderful feminism.

45:53.652 --> 45:54.813
And delicious stories.

45:54.913 --> 45:56.976
Wonderful characterizations.

45:56.996 --> 45:57.196
Okay.

45:57.616 --> 46:10.592
30 years later, I woke up one morning, and I said to Leona, you know, they've reprinted, they are reprinting everything under the sun now, but they never reprinted those Louisa Alton stories.

46:10.612 --> 46:12.034
I'm going to reprint them.

46:12.054 --> 46:12.715
Isn't that great?

46:13.640 --> 46:17.887
And it took a lot of work, of course, getting the copies and all that.

46:17.987 --> 46:21.493
But Mauro put out a book of four of them.

46:22.114 --> 46:24.178
The book was called Behind the Mask.

46:24.198 --> 46:29.126
This was followed by a sequel the next year called Plots and Counterplots.

46:29.146 --> 46:30.188
Is this fairly recent?

46:30.328 --> 46:32.572
This was in the 70s.

46:33.974 --> 46:34.755
I can give you one.

46:34.775 --> 46:37.320
I think I have one extra.

46:37.340 --> 46:39.343
I can find it.

46:39.948 --> 46:52.618
Two years ago, Little Brown brought out the third collection called The Double Life, and Greenwood is bringing out a fourth collection next year called Freaks of Genius.

46:53.600 --> 46:54.362
This is old.

46:54.697 --> 46:55.598
They're all new.

46:55.638 --> 47:03.867
Now, I tell you how... So, because... Because Liana discovered the pseudonym, but now this is followed by anonymous stories of her.

47:03.887 --> 47:08.092
Now, how do you find, how do you prove an anonymous story is by somebody?

47:08.232 --> 47:08.893
That's hard.

47:08.993 --> 47:12.517
And when you've got proof that it's her pseudonym... How do you do that?

47:13.418 --> 47:15.981
We were editing the journals.

47:16.001 --> 47:18.684
That's a wonderful stuff.

47:18.704 --> 47:22.088
And the journals are out now, but we were editing them, and we started...

47:22.372 --> 47:30.902
At the end of each year, she's got a list of stories she wrote and what she got paid for.

47:31.503 --> 47:32.965
The freak of a genius.

47:33.005 --> 47:49.745
The first place we look, of course, is Lesley's because we know by this time that she's had a long relationship with Lesley's magazine.

47:49.985 --> 47:51.687
And they're wonderful stories.

47:52.561 --> 48:00.517
You see, this is so important for me, because here you are doing precisely what I'm trying to demonstrate.

48:01.098 --> 48:06.669
You are preserving, discovering, purpose, and preserving.

48:06.789 --> 48:12.561
And presenting another side of this really very remarkable woman, both together, Dick and Oliver.

48:12.929 --> 48:16.135
I'm a fellow at the AAS a week and a half ago.

48:16.195 --> 48:17.317
I know Victor Birch.

48:17.337 --> 48:19.000
Have you ever heard of him?

48:19.020 --> 48:19.601
Victor Birch.

48:19.761 --> 48:20.743
He's a delightful man.

48:20.803 --> 48:21.825
I just met him.

48:21.845 --> 48:22.607
Hell no.

48:22.647 --> 48:26.734
Well, I've never met him, but we have corresponded for Maddie and Victor Birch.

48:26.774 --> 48:30.902
And in connection with flower things, he came up with so much information from me.

48:30.922 --> 48:31.162
Great.

48:31.743 --> 48:33.807
He's going to be in my book.

48:34.478 --> 48:35.700
He's going to be in.

48:36.080 --> 48:37.142
I would hope so.

48:37.202 --> 48:38.424
Literary detective.

48:38.464 --> 48:39.506
Literary detective.

48:39.646 --> 48:41.489
If it's written, somebody wrote it.

48:41.509 --> 48:42.330
That's his motto.

48:42.350 --> 48:42.971
That's right.

48:42.991 --> 48:44.854
His motto is, if it's written, somebody wrote it.

48:44.974 --> 48:46.657
He just called it Algin, another Algin.

48:46.677 --> 48:47.338
Yeah, I guess the Algin.

48:47.358 --> 48:50.102
He wants to call himself bibliotech now.

48:50.322 --> 48:51.825
Bibliotech now.

48:52.045 --> 48:53.668
Bibliographical detective.

48:53.728 --> 48:56.011
Yeah, well, he's 66.

48:56.251 --> 48:58.014
I asked him how old he is, and he told me.

48:58.956 --> 49:00.518
But his story is great.

49:00.558 --> 49:02.141
He never had an undergraduate degree.

49:02.902 --> 49:03.102
No, sure.

49:03.368 --> 49:09.034
Oh, this is... Oh, so much information, yes.

49:09.234 --> 49:10.476
He's a lovely man.

49:10.496 --> 49:13.239
And he sent me information about it, too.

49:14.960 --> 49:17.323
He said he's fantastic.

49:17.343 --> 49:21.828
He said he's going to do a... Yeah, he said he got a bit grand if I heard of mine.

49:21.848 --> 49:23.129
Oh, well, I'll call him.

49:23.149 --> 49:24.591
I'm going to talk to him next week.

49:24.851 --> 49:28.155
Well, give him my... I will.

49:28.295 --> 49:29.376
I will, yes.

49:29.525 --> 49:32.628
Anyway, he's telling me he's got a $50,000 grant.

49:32.888 --> 49:43.677
If I heard this right, I was on the phone, to do a flick on the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, which is, I don't think, quite up his alley.

49:47.581 --> 49:48.782
I'll ask him very discreetly.

49:48.802 --> 49:50.744
Unless he was pulling my leg, I don't know.

49:50.764 --> 49:53.366
Wow, he's working now on Horatio Alger.

49:53.526 --> 49:54.026
I know.

49:54.046 --> 49:57.730
He just did this little article.

49:58.170 --> 49:59.211
And this is what he collects.

49:59.680 --> 50:02.062
And he collects, and he said, you've got to come to my house.

50:02.082 --> 50:08.648
His house is falling, it's filled to bursting with magazines, pulp magazines and science fiction magazines.

50:08.709 --> 50:12.232
This VV that I mentioned was published as a dying novel.

50:12.852 --> 50:15.455
And you know what else he collects, which made me mention his name?

50:16.536 --> 50:23.763
He mentioned Alcock writing these, what did you call them, not thrillers, but sensational.

50:23.943 --> 50:28.287
Well, he said he has specialized in determining which authors

50:28.688 --> 50:49.026
wrote soft pornography so they could survive i mean there's pseudonymous names and i said could you name some of them for me no i can't because you know they wouldn't like it i said you mean they're still alive he said they're all alive but uh he said it is important to identify who they are

50:49.546 --> 51:12.448
and yeah i certainly don't collect it for the titillation that it might may or may not offer but but to document you haven't mentioned this to me i suppose yeah well i i can be pretty probing and then uh we're going to get together and talk about this but this is important you are it is important for the literary detective or whatever you want to call yourself to go out and determine

51:13.323 --> 51:13.784
What it is.

51:13.864 --> 51:15.266
If it's written, somebody wrote it.

51:15.306 --> 51:15.787
That's right.

51:15.807 --> 51:17.069
It's a rather crude phrase.

51:17.149 --> 51:20.494
And in Orphan's case, the stories are worth preserving.

51:20.514 --> 51:21.816
They're wonderful stories.

51:22.597 --> 51:24.560
They have literary merit.

51:24.660 --> 51:27.684
Not just biographical, bibliographic merit.

51:27.704 --> 51:28.786
They have literary merit.

51:28.806 --> 51:31.109
They're very good page terms.

51:31.129 --> 51:31.590
That's great.

51:31.610 --> 51:34.014
See, I'm making connections now.

51:34.054 --> 51:38.120
The more people I talk to, by the way, things come together.

51:38.480 --> 51:42.486
I've got about 100 interviews, by the way.

51:42.955 --> 51:53.248
I shouldn't ask this question.

51:54.489 --> 51:55.971
When are you going to turn in?

51:56.152 --> 52:02.820
Well, I'm under contract to turn in the manuscript in March of 1991.

52:02.900 --> 52:06.124
What deal is that?

52:07.846 --> 52:10.870
It was a big operator.

52:11.238 --> 52:12.460
He didn't buy one book.

52:12.480 --> 52:14.202
He bought a collection.

52:14.523 --> 52:14.783
Yeah.

52:15.524 --> 52:18.248
And he was Mr. Wright's right hand.

52:18.268 --> 52:25.118
He was Mr. His ad in the Pegasus of the Garage.

52:25.178 --> 52:28.703
He was probably QVAL.

52:28.763 --> 52:30.045
That was it.

52:30.285 --> 52:35.793
But what's curious is why Harry Ransom, he would be the exclusive agent for Texas.

52:35.933 --> 52:36.334
I don't know.

52:36.567 --> 52:47.702
She was a difficult little lady, but she was a wonderful woman in Montefiore.

52:47.802 --> 52:51.006
She really made Montefiore.

52:51.347 --> 52:58.737
There was a woman who had no education, but really became... She was friends with Montefiore.

53:01.821 --> 53:06.507
And she helped establish their collection.

53:06.790 --> 53:09.894
I talked to Kirschenbaum, not because he's a great dealer.

53:10.595 --> 53:14.521
I was astonished to read that he's 95.

53:14.581 --> 53:15.422
He's 95.

53:16.003 --> 53:23.815
He's 95 years old, and he has attended every auction since Hope.

53:24.315 --> 53:27.600
He claims to have attended the 1912 Sessions of the Hope.

53:27.850 --> 53:44.351
Well, I talked to him and, you know, I got his impressions of John Quinn and Jerome Kern, you know, and... Well, again, it's him talking.

53:44.432 --> 53:51.681
He could have been, actually, I think I was...

53:52.083 --> 53:55.666
It goes back to the history.

53:55.806 --> 53:58.609
Everybody wore a tuxedo.

53:58.729 --> 54:02.432
I mean, it was hard-fledged entirely.

54:02.913 --> 54:06.796
And it was very exciting and very interesting.

54:06.816 --> 54:08.938
How good was Newton's stuff?

54:09.018 --> 54:10.540
Yeah, we were fine.

54:10.560 --> 54:18.167
Johnson, the United States, mostly Samuel Johnson, and certainly Englishman.

54:19.628 --> 54:20.689
Recently,

54:21.260 --> 54:33.419
Maria Scumman, Nick Hathbar, a copy of Mary Waltoncraft, Vindication of Enlightenment, the first edition of September.

54:33.439 --> 54:37.425
It turned out to be the A. Edward Newton copy.

54:37.465 --> 54:45.478
It was the copy that we had seen sold at the A. Edward Newton sale, sold to the Clemens Library.

54:45.931 --> 54:57.928
bought by Fleming for the Clements Library, with a note from Fleming to the then librarian, who was a woman, saying, this is a very nice book for a lady, something like that.

54:58.769 --> 55:05.418
I think he had fetched $20 at the sale, and his commission, $2.

55:06.620 --> 55:07.261
We had it.

55:07.281 --> 55:07.922
We had it.

55:07.942 --> 55:10.826
It was an original book uncut.

55:10.846 --> 55:13.710
They had been described as movies.

55:13.825 --> 55:15.306
shaky or loose.

55:16.587 --> 55:22.512
By the time we got it, they were lost, but they were there and could be repaired.

55:22.733 --> 55:23.974
And made of a book.

55:24.654 --> 55:29.859
It was sold at the last... It had been deaccessioned by some white players.

55:29.879 --> 55:31.220
Stupidly, I don't know.

55:31.240 --> 55:33.742
It was sold to an English dealer.

55:35.243 --> 55:36.164
And when was this?

55:36.184 --> 55:38.987
Oh, this was this past book fan.

55:39.007 --> 55:39.487
Oh, really?

55:40.088 --> 55:41.149
Okay.

55:41.169 --> 55:42.870
It was very recent, yeah.

55:43.340 --> 55:52.529
There's a Latin expression, Father of the Bellet, Haben, Sunds.

55:52.549 --> 55:59.917
Books have their own fates.

55:59.937 --> 56:00.738
That's wonderful.

56:00.798 --> 56:05.602
And you assist them in achieving their destiny.

56:05.622 --> 56:08.465
In between boards, I always wanted to do it.

56:08.565 --> 56:10.107
I wrote the history of the board.

56:11.673 --> 56:14.737
I took around Mr. Fraser Farley.

56:14.757 --> 56:29.396
From the moment he conceived the book and went to England to write it, his first publication in Strasbourg, and the fate of that copy, two modern times.

56:29.516 --> 56:31.178
And I had the most marvelous time.

56:31.518 --> 56:35.804
Because, of course, this book, the genuine copy, never existed.

56:35.904 --> 56:37.766
But it shows what could happen to the book.

56:38.447 --> 56:40.650
The vicissitudes of a book.

56:41.086 --> 56:50.240
and the heights of a book, the excitement of a pause, until it's finally acquired, we hope for it.

56:50.260 --> 56:54.366
Sure, the book, that way, becomes sort of a microcosm of the whole world.

56:54.667 --> 56:57.671
Well, I can trace this history.

56:58.092 --> 57:01.777
I just couldn't do anything with it, so I did.

57:01.917 --> 57:06.925
I had a marvelous time, and it landed up in these panels.

57:07.681 --> 57:12.670
How do you feel about, I mean, you do think that books should find a permanent home at some point?

57:13.211 --> 57:13.692
No.

57:14.574 --> 57:24.452
But she did say that the book ultimately should ultimately find a permanent home, but do you think that they should continue on their travels?

57:24.512 --> 57:26.175
They should continue on their travels.

57:26.195 --> 57:27.277
Well, yeah, they're two schools.

57:27.377 --> 57:30.162
Some people feel everybody should have had something.

57:31.289 --> 57:33.292
Perspective, ah, I should have pleasure.

57:33.312 --> 57:37.659
In the moment, the books are put into law first because they never command.

57:38.260 --> 57:38.720
But they do.

57:38.841 --> 57:40.964
But you think it's permanent.

57:41.605 --> 57:44.129
You hope it's never permanent.

57:44.149 --> 57:45.571
There's nothing permanent.

57:45.591 --> 57:51.820
Well, there's a story that I'm going to use about Leslie Rosenwald when he bought that vicious anti-Semitic thing.

57:51.881 --> 57:56.327
He said that's the only time he ever told Rosenbach that price was no object.

57:56.387 --> 57:59.372
And this was in 1933 because he didn't want the Nazis to get it.

57:59.723 --> 58:04.267
And this is this horrible anti-Semitic thing that... Oh, the Margarita?

58:04.287 --> 58:06.309
I think it was Simon and Trent, something like that.

58:06.810 --> 58:10.513
There was a book in German, and it's only a Margarita.

58:10.533 --> 58:11.494
No, this is another one.

58:11.554 --> 58:13.576
What happened is he bought it, Rosenbach got it.

58:14.077 --> 58:22.425
He gave it to the Jewish Historical League in Walther, Massachusetts, which just last year sold it to Taylor Lent after 50 years.

58:23.385 --> 58:26.068
It came down here, $165,000.

58:26.285 --> 58:29.669
Fortunately, the buyer gave it to Yeshiva.

58:30.690 --> 58:36.476
But my point is, Rosenwald hated this so much, yet he still bought it.

58:36.496 --> 58:37.497
Why didn't he destroy it?

58:37.537 --> 58:39.199
This is a sign of the true collector.

58:39.219 --> 58:40.601
He can't destroy it.

58:40.641 --> 58:41.181
That's the point.

58:41.201 --> 58:46.767
He who destroys a good book destroys reason itself.

58:47.088 --> 58:50.031
John Milton.

58:50.855 --> 59:05.872
I guess the Bradley-Martin does provide an example, an interesting illustration where the ornithological books perhaps should have been kept together as a collection, because they were unique.

59:06.232 --> 59:07.734
But nothing is permanent.

59:07.754 --> 59:12.179
You have to realize that nothing is permanent.

59:12.199 --> 59:17.345
Larger is deaccession, and they're red, and I've seen it turn into again.

59:17.365 --> 59:19.107
They can hope for permanence.

59:19.390 --> 59:28.343
Didn't that happen if Nicholas Barker was telling me about a case where Walter Jackson, I guess, at Harvard.

59:28.403 --> 59:29.585
William Jackson.

59:30.326 --> 59:39.780
William Jackson actually took a copy of a book that was perfect, and he allowed it to be sold because he said it's too perfect for a collection.

59:39.881 --> 59:41.643
I got to check this out.

59:42.184 --> 59:46.430
Well, he said, well, apparently the book now has found its way back to Princeton.

59:46.511 --> 59:48.874
Jackson was a snob collector.

59:49.681 --> 59:53.485
Oh, but he was a very close girl.

59:53.505 --> 59:55.707
But he had to have the best.

59:55.727 --> 59:57.229
He only wanted the best.

59:57.369 --> 59:59.211
I mean, we sold Jackson.

59:59.611 --> 01:00:01.573
Jackson was a customer.

01:00:01.713 --> 01:00:02.674
We knew Jackson.

01:00:02.714 --> 01:00:04.796
He was a marvelous customer.

01:00:04.816 --> 01:00:07.799
He was a snob, and there are snobs.

01:00:07.819 --> 01:00:11.102
Now, Wing was a marvelous human being.

01:00:11.122 --> 01:00:12.564
He was a mensch.

01:00:12.584 --> 01:00:14.406
He was your friend.

01:00:15.146 --> 01:00:16.768
He talked your language.

01:00:17.221 --> 01:00:18.923
And he didn't fuss about it.

01:00:18.983 --> 01:00:23.727
I mean, you go to Wings' office, which is about this big.

01:00:24.468 --> 01:00:25.629
You couldn't even sit down.

01:00:25.649 --> 01:00:27.771
He would say, oh, throw some books on the floor.

01:00:28.052 --> 01:00:29.693
Put a chair on the folio.

01:00:29.833 --> 01:00:30.954
That's what he said.

01:00:31.034 --> 01:00:33.036
He was then working on his SPC.

01:00:33.136 --> 01:00:36.380
And all the slips were in the shoeboxes.

01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:37.661
This was Wings.

01:00:37.941 --> 01:00:40.884
This is the difference in what?

01:00:40.904 --> 01:00:42.586
In librarians.

01:00:42.726 --> 01:00:45.068
And the whole, and everything's highly polished.

01:00:45.638 --> 01:00:46.885
With wings off us.

01:00:48.052 --> 01:00:48.856
Such a mess.

01:00:49.238 --> 01:00:50.586
He said, oh, I've got a life.
