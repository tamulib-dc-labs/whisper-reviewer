WEBVTT

00:06.072 --> 00:07.974
So this is M152.

00:08.535 --> 00:18.847
In Bamberg, that's going to standard history, or rather, standard going to identifying prints, called How to Identify Prints.

00:18.867 --> 00:19.608
It's number six.

00:20.809 --> 00:22.091
And there'll be 12 of them.

00:22.111 --> 00:29.780
There'll always be in these mylar folders, which are, I don't want you looking at things through the plastic, but I don't want them to self-destruct when they're not being used or when they're being passed around.

00:30.561 --> 00:32.563
So there'll be 12 of them in mylar.

00:32.583 --> 00:35.286
There'll be a plot sheet.

00:35.840 --> 00:42.706
for the instructor, so that the instructor knows what's going on when he's teaching it.

00:43.667 --> 00:48.451
And when I'm teaching, I guess you may have this.

00:49.653 --> 00:50.553
Oh, that's right.

00:50.573 --> 00:52.535
So this is the chronological thing.

00:52.595 --> 00:58.601
So if I want to know what I've got for the turn into the 18th century, I can go to this.

00:58.621 --> 01:02.544
And these, you see, all refer to packets back there.

01:02.564 --> 01:04.446
So each one of these is a separate packet.

01:05.270 --> 01:09.455
And then I also print this out in Gascoigne order, which is this.

01:10.076 --> 01:19.467
So if I want to collect all of my lithography examples, for example, I can do it that way.

01:22.431 --> 01:23.792
Are you passionate about books?

01:24.713 --> 01:25.995
Or is this, I mean...

01:28.287 --> 01:31.852
I know that goes off into other territory.

01:31.952 --> 01:35.497
Is Clinton passionate about government?

01:35.597 --> 01:36.618
It's what I do.

01:38.020 --> 01:40.704
I don't know if I'm passionate about it or not.

01:40.724 --> 01:49.536
In your talk, for instance, you said that it doesn't bother you when you see this development towards virtual libraries and

01:50.140 --> 01:51.281
books that will show up.

01:51.361 --> 01:53.543
Of course it doesn't, no.

01:53.643 --> 01:56.846
And yet, do you feel that you're teaching an anachronism here?

01:57.347 --> 02:03.432
Are you teaching an anachronism if you're teaching 16th century politics?

02:03.452 --> 02:06.615
I mean, books have had a long run and they're still very much a part of our lives.

02:06.996 --> 02:08.937
But the internet is better for many things.

02:10.018 --> 02:17.305
I don't want to, and look, I mean, ten years ago when I wanted to know what this library had, five years ago when I came, I had to go upstairs and look in the card catalog.

02:17.325 --> 02:19.287
Now I go to the nearest computer.

02:19.587 --> 02:22.972
10 years from now, I'll be able to get plain text to most of the books I want.

02:22.992 --> 02:27.258
That's a hell of a lot better than waiting for Interlibrary at all.

02:27.278 --> 02:27.638
That's better.

02:27.658 --> 02:39.455
Now, it's not the whole story, but I want to know what Henry Bohn was doing and how people read in the 19th century, and I want this copy, and I literally want this copy.

02:39.475 --> 02:41.498
Look at it.

02:42.399 --> 02:45.443
B-O-H-N, Bohn's Standard Library, of course.

02:45.811 --> 02:53.943
And it's where the, it's where the Harvard, it's where the Loeb-Clapps Library picked up, that kind of thing.

02:53.963 --> 02:59.451
I mean, this is a gorgeous copy of an insignificant book, but it's got the publisher's catalog.

02:59.812 --> 03:05.300
He was one of the first to use his endpapers for ads, an idea that didn't take, but it could have.

03:05.320 --> 03:08.144
So what is the approximate year of this?

03:08.244 --> 03:08.605
1850s?

03:08.625 --> 03:11.829
Wow, that's, it is a wonderful, 1863.

03:11.849 --> 03:12.230
1883.

03:14.093 --> 03:15.615
No, don't believe it.

03:15.916 --> 03:16.417
It is.

03:18.359 --> 03:20.482
It's just a later edition.

03:20.502 --> 03:22.264
I just have stronger glasses than you do.

03:22.485 --> 03:24.347
That's a real throwback for an edition.

03:24.367 --> 03:26.350
That's the binding of the 50s.

03:26.370 --> 03:27.811
I never bothered to change.

03:28.192 --> 03:31.176
They had them, which explains why they were able to run out of business, I suppose.

03:31.877 --> 03:32.457
These are books.

03:33.899 --> 03:37.164
These are tools, again, to go back to a word you used earlier.

03:37.184 --> 03:37.744
These are tools.

03:37.844 --> 03:38.285
That's for you.

03:39.346 --> 03:45.214
Oh.

03:46.797 --> 03:51.142
So when I'm teaching along and somebody asks for something, these all refer to the packets.

03:51.983 --> 03:54.285
So they say, well, what is China paper?

03:54.986 --> 03:56.247
And I say, wait a minute.

03:56.267 --> 03:59.111
And we pull up ML18.

03:59.731 --> 04:02.915
So where do you go searching for all this stuff?

04:02.935 --> 04:05.317
Well, it's 25 years.

04:05.498 --> 04:11.404
All right, I've got 400 former students, half of them, to send me something every once in a while.

04:11.755 --> 04:23.309
I mean, it isn't quite true that never a day goes by without something arrives, but certainly never a week goes by without something arrives, and usually it's every day something comes in.

04:23.329 --> 04:25.452
Now, it can be totally insignificant, it can be this.

04:26.173 --> 04:28.075
For example, these are recent gifts.

04:28.095 --> 04:30.298
From the gentleman who showed me around.

04:30.338 --> 04:33.362
He's totally told, because he pointed at the mouth of it.

04:33.382 --> 04:34.363
He's just back from England.

04:35.424 --> 04:37.087
And you know what it is.

04:37.107 --> 04:39.329
It's the credit of that plate.

04:39.349 --> 04:41.492
This is from Frick.

04:42.265 --> 04:57.464
So this enterprise really does depend to a great extent on your friends.

04:57.704 --> 05:03.671
These are things depicted in line, which is just fine with me.

05:03.992 --> 05:06.855
They're very early 19th century.

05:08.371 --> 05:14.457
prints that intend to imitate chalk drawings, and you do it so well that I'm not at all sure how the color was done.

05:14.978 --> 05:20.944
It's a stiff engraving, but I'm having great difficulty trying to figure out how they were printed, which is why they're out there, because I'm still studying them.

05:21.584 --> 05:26.369
They've been written about someplace, but there are heaps of them.

05:27.390 --> 05:32.255
And I'm just pleased, now mind you, they also send me some stuff that I have no use for at all.

05:34.217 --> 05:35.078
Well, that's okay.

05:35.198 --> 05:37.821
You'd rather have the opportunity to pass on it than to...

05:38.375 --> 05:44.982
What the stuff here is, we'll deal with that later.

05:45.002 --> 05:46.463
This is how it works.

05:47.364 --> 05:51.088
Books come in, and these are books going into reserve.

05:51.228 --> 05:53.591
I don't want them now, but I don't want to throw them away either.

05:54.131 --> 05:54.852
So they go downstairs.

05:54.992 --> 05:57.275
I have, you see this wall here?

05:57.315 --> 05:57.815
Yep.

05:59.137 --> 06:00.678
You see how much space there is there?

06:01.279 --> 06:05.243
Okay, multiply that by 12, and that's how much storage space I have downstairs under it.

06:06.252 --> 06:09.296
So, and most of the stuff downstairs, there's some boxes like this.

06:10.218 --> 06:12.941
And the boxes just accumulate.

06:13.082 --> 06:16.567
For different purposes, this is one.

06:16.587 --> 06:18.690
We're working towards a show on dust jackets.

06:20.432 --> 06:27.702
And so these, how do you like that for a dust jacket?

06:28.664 --> 06:29.164
Zoom that.

06:29.184 --> 06:32.810
But there are also a lot of things like this, for example.

06:32.830 --> 06:33.551
You know about these?

06:34.051 --> 06:34.572
No.

06:34.838 --> 06:43.148
In the 40s, it was felt that certain dust jackets were a little bit raunchy for certain parts of the country, so the book was published in two dust jackets.

06:43.168 --> 06:44.209
I've never heard of it before.

06:44.249 --> 06:45.971
I've got dozens of examples.

06:47.372 --> 06:48.554
I'd never heard of that before.

06:49.595 --> 06:51.777
This one, obviously, is more suitable for Peoria.

06:51.858 --> 06:54.621
So you would really collect this book for the dust jacket?

06:55.762 --> 06:56.663
I'm not going to read the book.

06:56.783 --> 06:59.046
Obviously, but it's interesting because of the fact that it was printed.

06:59.066 --> 07:00.087
Well, this was given to me.

07:00.387 --> 07:02.630
by Candace Frosby, a local bookseller.

07:02.650 --> 07:03.992
We'll be at dinner tonight, if you can ask.

07:04.052 --> 07:07.537
So it's Hercules, the big green story.

07:07.557 --> 07:08.759
I didn't know the books.

07:08.839 --> 07:16.010
She was the one who told me and gave it to us as a present because she knew it was kind of worth it.

07:16.110 --> 07:17.071
Who's the author of that?

07:17.772 --> 07:19.715
It's by George Kirgo.

07:19.975 --> 07:20.857
A-I-R-G-O.

07:21.438 --> 07:27.306
Yeah, okay.

07:28.433 --> 07:32.780
You depend on the right day for double bus jackets.

07:32.800 --> 07:35.464
Here's the front shorts.

07:35.484 --> 07:36.846
Go back again.

07:37.888 --> 07:38.969
Oh, that's so funny.

07:39.350 --> 07:39.951
It's wonderful.

07:40.331 --> 07:40.792
It's wonderful.

07:40.832 --> 07:41.854
How many of these do you have?

07:42.014 --> 07:42.715
Well, right here.

07:42.755 --> 07:43.696
I've got about four of them.

07:45.019 --> 07:46.341
I've never heard of them before.

07:46.361 --> 07:47.843
Did you know about these before?

07:47.903 --> 07:50.166
Not until Candy Crafty gave me one.

07:50.186 --> 07:55.415
And then, of course, she started looking for them.

07:55.435 --> 07:56.576
That's my nephew, Albert.

07:56.636 --> 07:57.057
I leave.

07:57.408 --> 08:00.633
the island, what I won off Maddie, Hagen, and a poker game?

08:03.077 --> 08:03.998
You could do that today.

08:04.018 --> 08:05.480
Well, maybe you could, yeah.

08:05.941 --> 08:07.984
What's the year on this, just out of curiosity?

08:08.004 --> 08:10.108
They tend to be late 40s, early 50s.

08:11.149 --> 08:12.231
Very interesting.

08:13.853 --> 08:14.434
That's British.

08:14.675 --> 08:16.998
1969.

08:18.280 --> 08:20.163
And a pretty well-known British publisher.

08:21.024 --> 08:21.285
Certainly.

08:21.305 --> 08:23.949
Oh, yeah, sure.

08:23.969 --> 08:24.630
I don't know.

08:25.032 --> 08:26.454
Wonderful.

08:26.574 --> 08:31.679
Madame Geneva, is that one too?

08:32.680 --> 08:35.463
No, that's you.

08:36.825 --> 08:38.847
Jane Lane, what a great name, Jane Lane.

08:38.867 --> 08:44.593
Well, we're working towards a show on the rise of the author's dust jacket biography and photograph.

08:47.716 --> 08:49.538
And there's a phrase here,

08:56.369 --> 08:59.073
Her first book was the last accepted by a publisher and condition that Ms.

08:59.113 --> 09:00.135
Lane paid for the production.

09:00.515 --> 09:05.483
To do this, she worked in a house for consumptive, scrubbed floors, did good parts on stage.

09:05.644 --> 09:06.525
That's right.

09:06.545 --> 09:09.970
That's right.

09:09.990 --> 09:13.255
So that's what that's for.

09:13.936 --> 09:15.559
Or this, for example.

09:19.387 --> 09:20.548
This is pretty nice.

09:20.648 --> 09:22.550
This is a nice little lot of books, isn't it?

09:22.570 --> 09:23.871
Oh, yeah.

09:23.891 --> 09:27.695
You go downstairs and you see the other 20 boxes of this working towards the show.

09:28.055 --> 09:32.900
I love it.

09:34.281 --> 09:37.284
We're doing another show, which is probably next summer.

09:37.344 --> 09:40.527
Its working title is, are you sure this is a good idea?

09:41.688 --> 09:44.150
Or if that idea is in publishing?

09:44.170 --> 09:45.231
Or ideas that didn't work?

09:45.632 --> 09:46.453
Like, for instance.

09:46.473 --> 09:46.913
Like this.

09:49.222 --> 09:49.603
Okay.

09:50.063 --> 09:50.604
It's a novel.

09:51.806 --> 09:54.830
As I tell my students, we're very conservative in how we read.

09:54.850 --> 09:57.594
We don't like books in the shapes that we're not used to.

09:57.714 --> 09:59.397
It's clearly not a success.

09:59.417 --> 10:00.458
But what's amusing about it?

10:02.101 --> 10:03.743
We talk about the durability of the book.

10:04.564 --> 10:08.691
This novel comes with its own record, which none of us can play because... It's 78.

10:08.711 --> 10:09.852
No, it's 33.

10:09.952 --> 10:10.693
It's 33.

10:10.774 --> 10:13.558
But I haven't been able to play a record for about three years.

10:14.559 --> 10:16.562
I've got a turntable that I only hitched up.

10:17.285 --> 10:18.206
Bad idea.

10:18.787 --> 10:18.927
Mm-hmm.

10:18.947 --> 10:20.229
Well, but how would they know, see?

10:20.430 --> 10:21.471
It was early 90s, wasn't it?

10:21.511 --> 10:22.272
There was 90s?

10:23.033 --> 10:24.095
It was... No.

10:24.976 --> 10:25.437
Can't be.

10:27.901 --> 10:29.363
That's a bad, very bad idea.

10:29.403 --> 10:31.806
Nobody... I paid on it.

10:31.826 --> 10:32.768
Late 80s, isn't it?

10:32.788 --> 10:33.929
Here's your copyright page.

10:36.293 --> 10:37.735
Copyright 1993.

10:38.115 --> 10:38.496
Jesus.

10:39.538 --> 10:40.539
Bad idea.

10:40.559 --> 10:41.020
Stupid.

10:41.060 --> 10:41.761
Not even bad.

10:42.181 --> 10:43.223
Really stupid.

10:44.445 --> 10:44.625
Uh...

10:48.233 --> 10:51.177
Same book, same edition, same printing, brand new.

10:51.197 --> 10:51.657
Why?

10:52.738 --> 10:52.979
Why?

10:53.159 --> 10:53.579
Do you know?

10:53.840 --> 10:54.080
Sure.

10:54.400 --> 10:54.621
Why?

10:54.781 --> 10:56.182
Market share.

10:56.203 --> 10:57.384
It probably came in a box.

10:57.404 --> 10:58.185
It was on the floor.

10:59.687 --> 11:02.370
And probably two other colors as well, which, of course, I have to collect.

11:03.251 --> 11:04.733
And then I have to get the box that came in.

11:05.954 --> 11:07.436
You've seen that kind of display thing.

11:07.656 --> 11:08.898
Yeah, but not for hardcovers.

11:09.118 --> 11:10.359
It's very rare for hardcovers.

11:10.640 --> 11:17.548
There's one other, and that was the biography of Norman...

11:18.220 --> 11:19.661
General Norman and Schwarzkopf.

11:19.682 --> 11:20.182
Schwarzkopf.

11:20.202 --> 11:20.602
And you know what?

11:20.783 --> 11:22.544
It had the two sides of his face.

11:22.705 --> 11:24.366
That's right, yes.

11:24.487 --> 11:27.390
And also the one Jeffrey, what's his name, who did the O.J.

11:27.410 --> 11:28.491
Simpson look.

11:28.511 --> 11:31.173
It's black and white and one, and one is white and black.

11:31.213 --> 11:38.861
So they really did two different... And I'm sure it's... It looks like the same, so I don't have two of them.

11:38.901 --> 11:42.405
It's too bad I didn't... I had to review copies of them when I passed them along.

11:42.545 --> 11:45.188
I buy all of those, I see.

11:45.749 --> 11:47.130
Well, I have... I'll give an hour for it.

11:47.617 --> 11:50.860
Let me see if I... But it's what?

11:51.501 --> 11:52.382
I'd love to have a reference.

11:52.522 --> 11:53.303
Yeah.

11:53.463 --> 11:58.188
It was probably the best Simpson book, actually, was the guy that covered it for The New Yorker.

11:58.729 --> 11:59.429
More of the ideas.

12:01.231 --> 12:01.512
Okay.

12:01.572 --> 12:03.093
Little Man, Little Women.

12:03.173 --> 12:04.174
That's all right.

12:04.695 --> 12:05.496
Two novels in one?

12:06.116 --> 12:06.357
Mm-hmm.

12:06.377 --> 12:06.577
All right.

12:06.597 --> 12:07.838
But what do you think of this pairing?

12:11.062 --> 12:11.722
That's absurd.

12:11.943 --> 12:12.143
Yeah?

12:12.163 --> 12:12.823
That's absurd.

12:13.424 --> 12:14.285
It's a bad idea.

12:15.186 --> 12:17.168
Yeah, but you think that's going to hurt the sales of the book?

12:18.278 --> 12:20.561
I'm doing an exhibition on bad ideas in publishing.

12:21.241 --> 12:26.047
No, but I don't imagine anybody who wants Uncle Tom's Cabin wants Tom Brown's School Days.

12:26.127 --> 12:26.407
Do you?

12:26.547 --> 12:26.727
No.

12:27.028 --> 12:27.608
No, that's true.

12:27.648 --> 12:28.189
Bad idea.

12:32.834 --> 12:33.014
Okay.

12:33.034 --> 12:33.515
Okay.

12:33.535 --> 12:40.302
This is early 50s, and it's Grosset and Dunlap's attempt to do something that is neither hardbound nor paper field.

12:43.306 --> 12:46.429
They call these today French... French...

12:46.797 --> 12:49.301
Yeah, but basically what they call it is trade paperback.

12:49.381 --> 12:51.645
In 1950, there weren't any trade paperbacks.

12:51.685 --> 12:53.387
That's beginning to happen.

12:53.407 --> 12:57.394
So this is the American publishing industry groping its way towards the trade paperback.

12:59.116 --> 13:03.904
And at the time, a paperback meant 25 cents.

13:04.004 --> 13:05.687
Basically, they're all the same price.

13:05.927 --> 13:09.733
So that often they don't even have prices on them because everybody knows.

13:10.153 --> 13:13.058
And this is three times the expense of the paperback

13:13.342 --> 13:17.687
but half the price of the book, like a quarter of the price of the book, which would have been $2.50 or $3.

13:19.029 --> 13:19.770
Well, it didn't work.

13:19.830 --> 13:20.691
It isn't the way it went.

13:20.891 --> 13:23.715
Now, this is basically you deciding that idea, which I think is very good.

13:23.915 --> 13:24.456
It's excellent.

13:24.776 --> 13:26.638
Well, no, I mean, it's history decided.

13:27.780 --> 13:30.043
This is an uncommon format.

13:30.063 --> 13:34.068
You've never seen a book like this before, published in America in the 1950s.

13:34.088 --> 13:37.091
Clearly, the American publishing industry decided this wasn't the way to go.

13:37.652 --> 13:41.577
The American consumer decided the way to go was this book, but without this.

13:42.046 --> 13:45.449
Published like this, and you still charge the equivalent of 75 cents.

13:45.509 --> 13:50.174
Unless it was a prescient move that we don't know about either, because we do have the trade paperback now.

13:50.674 --> 13:50.974
Indeed.

13:51.435 --> 13:54.077
But this was groping towards it.

13:54.498 --> 13:57.500
Oh, brand new.

13:57.681 --> 13:58.301
A good American.

13:59.142 --> 14:00.744
This is what you see on the shelf.

14:02.225 --> 14:09.792
Stupid music.

14:12.404 --> 14:20.353
Ever to be so, first and foremost range of the internet, this means that you are now actively participating in a revolution of promises to forever change our offers and that readers meet.

14:20.954 --> 14:24.799
This is brand new, and the title of this is The Good American by Ted Flicker, right?

14:24.979 --> 14:25.179
Right.

14:25.780 --> 14:26.481
It's nonsense.

14:26.721 --> 14:27.762
So you go to the website.

14:28.623 --> 14:29.905
This is the entire website.

14:29.925 --> 14:31.046
There are no buttons.

14:33.389 --> 14:34.550
You're kidding.

14:34.570 --> 14:37.734
And it's, what's the word?

14:38.495 --> 14:40.217
www.com.

14:40.619 --> 14:44.184
Good American Day hyphen American dot com.

14:44.384 --> 14:45.085
Yeah.

14:47.369 --> 14:48.751
And so that's all they give you there?

14:49.111 --> 14:50.133
That's the total website.

14:50.914 --> 14:54.178
Thanks to the thousands of you who have given us your support, we have run out of books.

14:54.198 --> 14:58.485
As you read this, the very last copies of The Good American are being shipped from our warehouse, but we cannot figure it out.

14:58.505 --> 15:00.628
As now, we hopefully, like you, await further developments.

15:00.648 --> 15:01.269
What does that mean?

15:01.309 --> 15:03.111
If they're the publisher or not, they just go print more.

15:05.174 --> 15:05.895
Ted Flicker.

15:06.035 --> 15:07.217
It's a bad idea.

15:08.615 --> 15:10.998
I think so, only because we've never heard of it before.

15:11.098 --> 15:15.624
I'll get you some bad ideas.

15:15.644 --> 15:16.705
I get a lot of review books.

15:17.106 --> 15:20.210
I get tons of them, you know.

15:22.993 --> 15:24.935
See, it's good.

15:24.955 --> 15:26.517
I know what you're looking for now.

15:26.558 --> 15:27.298
You'd be surprised.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.521
We're working towards another show.

15:30.903 --> 15:32.024
What can you do with endpapers?

15:34.167 --> 15:34.447
Nice.

15:36.049 --> 15:36.830
Oh, lovely.

15:37.011 --> 15:38.132
A little crazy, I think.

15:38.382 --> 15:38.983
Nice.

15:39.223 --> 15:39.463
Nice.

15:39.523 --> 15:39.844
Clever.

15:42.987 --> 15:49.335
Nice.

15:49.395 --> 15:52.018
How to get color printing without exactly having color printing.

15:54.661 --> 15:56.102
In the beginning, there were mistakes.

15:56.923 --> 15:57.905
The paper has fallen.

15:58.445 --> 15:59.366
It should be like this.

15:59.386 --> 16:02.750
Yep.

16:02.770 --> 16:04.813
Well, that's a publishing error.

16:05.033 --> 16:06.494
This is a show on dust jackets.

16:06.655 --> 16:06.955
I see.

16:07.255 --> 16:08.857
I'm sorry, this is a show on endpapers.

16:10.539 --> 16:11.841
It's very expensive to do that.

16:16.487 --> 16:21.974
And in the book club, by God, they did still another picture, obviously.

16:22.875 --> 16:23.716
But what's going on here?

16:23.736 --> 16:27.160
Did they intend to illustrate the book and then can the illustrations and have them all left over?

16:27.801 --> 16:28.702
They had extras.

16:28.722 --> 16:33.008
There seemed to be a suspicious number of illustrations.

16:33.048 --> 16:34.370
Well, it's just interesting.

16:34.390 --> 16:34.630
Yeah.

16:35.183 --> 16:36.865
Without knowing anything else about it.

16:37.165 --> 16:37.385
Right.

16:45.072 --> 16:46.754
It's a teacher's desk copy.

16:47.334 --> 16:47.574
Right.

16:47.975 --> 16:48.635
Okay, sure.

16:49.416 --> 16:53.060
These are the ones that they give them with the hope that they'll also come on.

16:53.100 --> 16:55.121
It struck me as being interesting.

16:55.142 --> 16:57.203
It's an example of what you can use an editor for.

16:57.223 --> 16:57.504
Sure.

16:57.524 --> 16:58.064
Absolutely.

16:58.104 --> 17:00.366
As an ad, as a selling tool, as a marketing tool.

17:00.667 --> 17:03.129
And so the Bone Library then goes in too.

17:03.149 --> 17:04.210
So it'll be an interesting show.

17:04.230 --> 17:04.330
Yeah.

17:04.597 --> 17:14.006
And so we're, as I tell my students, we're container-oriented rather than content-oriented.

17:16.128 --> 17:18.851
So that is going on here.

17:19.371 --> 17:31.363
But this kind of stuff people give us, they know, of course, that we collect fortunes with these fortunes.

17:32.845 --> 17:38.413
so that somebody's just sent their summer's work.

17:38.433 --> 17:42.039
Actually, we have a much larger collection of our own, which he knows.

17:42.540 --> 17:50.211
But ours are Charlottesville fortunes, and he thought that it would be interesting to see how they are different from Michigan fortunes, which is very different.

17:50.772 --> 17:57.342
We maintain a pretty good collection of videotapes on bookish subjects.

17:57.362 --> 17:58.684
That looks very interesting.

18:02.039 --> 18:05.262
The book of Kells, I noticed.

18:05.282 --> 18:15.553
The influence of history on the art of bookbinding in France.

18:18.335 --> 18:24.642
Sounds like a stretch in terms of a thesis, too.

18:28.706 --> 18:32.029
Take a look at those.

18:32.110 --> 18:46.683
You have books apart constantly for... This book is incomplete.

18:46.923 --> 18:48.644
Oh, so it's incomplete.

18:48.664 --> 18:52.027
And look at the binding, which is a self-destructing binding.

18:52.067 --> 18:55.811
This is not a book that people are exactly going to read, you know.

18:56.531 --> 19:00.835
If I rip it apart, I will put 12 leaves into my typography packets

19:01.169 --> 19:05.294
So people who wanted to teach text and gloss would have those.

19:05.795 --> 19:15.887
I would put 12 leaves into the paper packets, chronologically arranged, so people teaching the history of paper, and 12 leaves to pass around is infinitely more useful in class than one account of the whole book.

19:15.907 --> 19:16.167
Sure.

19:18.770 --> 19:23.996
Of and otherwise, and I would certainly use 12 of these in the illustration packets because they're superb woodcuts.

19:24.917 --> 19:27.160
But in fact, I felt that the book just...

19:28.135 --> 19:56.235
well you see it's under 1824 i'm sorry it's in 1524 right which must be the day of the book uh well i think the woodcocks are earlier than that uh the blocks are cut about 1510. uh not quite certainly not quite an incunable but but old oh right i got a lot of little books here and a lot of valuable ones although i don't want to i don't advertise that very heavily uh and some pretty ones too as you can see here

19:58.173 --> 20:00.996
Those are beautiful.

20:01.617 --> 20:02.317
Those are aquatics.

20:03.198 --> 20:05.861
Isn't that wonderful?

20:07.743 --> 20:10.245
Nice.

20:10.546 --> 20:15.050
But, you know, I mean, this is for individual students to play with.

20:15.070 --> 20:18.834
When I'm teaching, I'll go here.

20:18.854 --> 20:22.978
And you can see it.

20:26.943 --> 20:27.403
These

20:27.873 --> 20:41.913
and medium are my Accra tent, each and every 12 individual examples in each of these, is a medium, then the Accra tent here, 17, which is these.

20:41.974 --> 20:46.140
Then there'll be medium, large, and large over there.

20:46.660 --> 20:56.715
So then I will find my sheet here on my occasion.

20:58.163 --> 21:09.578
Well, tell me... You see, these are my aquatint.

21:09.598 --> 21:11.160
Four folders I've got to play with.

21:11.180 --> 21:13.843
Not as many as I'd like, but enough.

21:15.085 --> 21:19.150
And the trick is, this is my 12th magic number, I know there are 12.

21:19.210 --> 21:20.372
They wouldn't be in there if they weren't.

21:20.832 --> 21:26.820
So I know that I can teach up to 24 people, or 22 people, which I never teach as many as I teach.

21:27.290 --> 21:33.878
I restrict my own class actually to 11 because I want to talk to my own, and I want each one of them to have one.

21:34.518 --> 21:36.160
So I teach at the summer in this room.

21:37.522 --> 21:42.047
I admitted 11 students and turned away 40 this summer.

21:42.087 --> 21:44.289
So I'm teaching the course twice this winter to catch up.

21:45.331 --> 21:48.094
It's the first time we've had rare book school in the winter.

21:48.915 --> 21:52.639
The concept of rare book school is 180 degrees out from this, isn't it?

21:53.142 --> 21:55.585
And where the container is the most important thing.

21:55.625 --> 21:57.627
A rare book school is a whole container.

21:57.647 --> 21:59.729
I mean, of course, I teach this illustration process.

22:00.130 --> 22:01.011
At a rare book school?

22:01.331 --> 22:02.312
Yeah.

22:02.332 --> 22:06.056
When I say this is wonderful, I don't mean it's a beautiful print.

22:06.076 --> 22:11.822
I mean, it's a wonderful example of a process called Nicholas Piccolo.

22:11.842 --> 22:14.205
Look here.

22:15.166 --> 22:18.289
That's fine.

22:18.309 --> 22:18.850
You need to see something.

22:18.870 --> 22:19.491
This is great.

22:19.551 --> 22:22.474
Come on.

22:22.623 --> 22:25.487
So Rare Book School is basically an extension of this then?

22:26.808 --> 22:33.517
These learnings are basically made for him.

22:33.537 --> 22:35.279
Welcome to the Bowlers of the Library.

22:35.880 --> 22:40.366
So Rare Book School is not on the bottom level of the library.

22:40.386 --> 22:41.868
You're on the fourth level.

22:43.490 --> 22:51.060
I think those people are teachers of Norse.

22:51.395 --> 22:53.677
Again, book binding structure 1500-1800.

22:53.717 --> 23:05.248
This is what he teaches you.

23:05.388 --> 23:05.629
Okay?

23:05.649 --> 23:09.452
So, I mean, whatever they are, they're his books.

23:09.472 --> 23:10.573
He's the only one that uses these.

23:10.613 --> 23:12.235
They're used one week a year.

23:12.896 --> 23:14.197
I don't even know what's in these boxes.

23:14.477 --> 23:15.558
I got the books for him.

23:16.119 --> 23:19.562
When a book comes in, remember I said it stays there until various instructors look at it.

23:20.487 --> 23:29.498
And after everybody's looked at it and decided they don't want it, then it goes into the general collections, and then I might think about ripping it apart, or giving it away, or doing something.

23:29.518 --> 23:31.020
But he's a wonderful book.

23:33.243 --> 23:38.289
He knows exactly what's in here, because he found it on Friday afternoon.

23:38.609 --> 23:39.430
2, 4, 6, 8.

23:39.470 --> 23:43.415
He's got 10.

23:43.435 --> 23:44.056
Right down this way.

23:44.076 --> 23:46.579
Martin Anthony teaches the history of the book.

23:47.251 --> 23:52.318
He uses a lot of my stuff upstairs because he's teaching generally, but these are his books.

23:52.398 --> 23:53.799
There's Moore Martin.

23:53.819 --> 23:55.482
This is Tim Barrett's paper-making course.

23:56.583 --> 24:02.130
Sue Allen teaches the history of cloth book-finding, and she's all of this.

24:02.150 --> 24:07.697
And then her husband, Deer, teaches design.

24:07.777 --> 24:08.118
This is him.

24:11.102 --> 24:15.267
So this material is just waiting here for your next... Absolutely.

24:16.073 --> 24:24.625
This is the principal collection likeness.

24:24.645 --> 24:25.746
Again, these books are only used for the purpose.

24:25.766 --> 24:28.590
These are used in my format and collation course.

24:28.610 --> 24:32.856
Three students get a box like this every day for a week, and they describe the books.

24:33.437 --> 24:39.144
They learn format, and they write out collations based on these.

24:39.164 --> 24:42.729
And we have all of these cataloging proof sheets for my instructors.

24:42.749 --> 24:43.971
That course has

24:44.373 --> 24:48.237
two principal instructors and six lab instructors.

24:48.277 --> 24:51.120
So it has 36 people, and it's the only large course in their book school.

24:51.700 --> 24:59.768
But there are 10 people who work the course full time during the week that it happens, so that the student-packing ratio is one to three.

24:59.788 --> 25:02.591
But these books will last forever because they're used one week a year.

25:03.953 --> 25:04.553
Now they're junk.

25:05.234 --> 25:12.321
But look, if you give me a 17-volume addition to something, minus four volumes, that's not late.

25:12.841 --> 25:13.922
Okay.

25:14.583 --> 25:22.414
I can put 12 limits of these boxes for each of the 12 different labs that are going to go on.

25:23.615 --> 25:26.660
This is the basement storage area.

25:26.800 --> 25:35.912
I've still got five books to tear off if they happen to have illustrations or they happen to be interesting typography or they happen to be on paper that's worth recording.

25:36.213 --> 25:45.363
So I like to say, you've seen this in my publicity, this is just more of the same, more of the same again.

25:46.344 --> 25:51.609
Bad ideas, yeah?

25:51.629 --> 25:59.217
Well, you see, these are just, it's just another show that is in the process that there's dust jackets.

25:59.238 --> 26:01.039
Are you curator for most of these?

26:01.440 --> 26:02.541
Well, I don't want to be.

26:02.774 --> 26:07.781
So it's another exercise, in other words.

26:07.801 --> 26:10.505
Well, you saw the Armed Services Edition thing.

26:11.106 --> 26:13.690
Well, I need shows that can be done quick.

26:13.710 --> 26:19.858
And the Rise of the Dust Jacket photograph is something that a kid could work up in time to do a show.

26:19.898 --> 26:22.001
He's not going to be able to do a show on John Milton.

26:22.021 --> 26:23.303
I don't have the books to support it.

26:23.844 --> 26:25.947
He hasn't had ten years of study of the field.

26:26.939 --> 26:33.348
But as with the ASE show, I mean, one smart kid can sit down in two months with my boxes.

26:33.448 --> 26:35.350
You see, I just turn the boxes over and say, go do a show.

26:35.370 --> 26:36.231
So it's an exercise.

26:36.452 --> 26:36.732
Yeah, sure.

26:36.752 --> 26:37.493
It's great.

26:37.513 --> 26:39.416
The students curate shows.

26:39.716 --> 26:40.437
Oh, they do.

26:40.537 --> 26:41.699
Do they come up with the ideas?

26:41.759 --> 26:44.042
Are these things you do in concert with each other?

26:44.643 --> 26:45.504
It's a negotiation.

26:45.784 --> 26:47.507
It's something that they're interested in.

26:47.527 --> 26:48.488
I tell them what I've got.

26:49.149 --> 26:54.516
Dan Miller, who did the ASE show, was made from 20th Century American History.

26:54.968 --> 26:58.031
ASC, once more, meaning Armed Services?

26:58.071 --> 27:00.493
You said that, of course, yeah.

27:01.114 --> 27:10.563
Okay.

27:10.884 --> 27:11.985
Very impressive.

27:12.325 --> 27:22.135
Now, you know that all the books are both Cal Show and below are mine, too.

27:22.335 --> 27:23.676
Yes, yes.

27:24.044 --> 27:27.308
I said, I was quite impressed by his book.

27:27.408 --> 27:30.712
And then I said, my God, these aren't all mine.

27:30.732 --> 27:33.435
He said, the ones are both minetaries.

27:34.697 --> 27:36.639
But his own collection is easily that size.

27:37.380 --> 27:38.521
It's pretty interesting, though.

27:38.541 --> 27:39.442
I like the concept.

27:39.903 --> 27:43.467
I asked him what he's going to do with it.

27:43.507 --> 27:47.031
He said, I don't know yet.

27:52.748 --> 27:55.931
And look up there.

27:58.414 --> 28:02.618
God is my laboratory.

28:02.638 --> 28:04.079
Oh, come on.

28:04.119 --> 28:04.700
You're sunning.

28:05.401 --> 28:10.065
I'm looking at the window, and you've got a Tim O'Brien nuclear age, and you're sunning a book.

28:12.087 --> 28:14.149
I want to see how long it takes.

28:14.169 --> 28:18.013
When it started out, it started out younger since all the Christmas marks.

28:19.698 --> 28:24.285
And it takes longer than you think, after nearly a year, after six months anyway.

28:25.226 --> 28:29.112
It's still, of course, yellow is notoriously fugitive.

28:31.536 --> 28:33.779
Look, I mean, this goes on for a long time.

28:33.919 --> 28:46.999
I didn't know the area jacket, but even the red faded, too.

28:47.039 --> 28:48.000
This book was so big.

28:48.773 --> 28:55.179
Morrow had to have a special make of paper for the book.

28:55.199 --> 28:56.620
So that's why we have this here.

28:56.860 --> 29:00.864
And the paperback is in the works.

29:00.884 --> 29:05.067
The book in the 4th edition.

29:05.087 --> 29:07.489
This is a little conservation section.

29:07.509 --> 29:10.972
These books are the same book, and they were originally done the same color.

29:15.797 --> 29:17.498
Cheap, cheap, cheap paper.

29:18.288 --> 29:19.029
That's not fair.

29:19.850 --> 29:25.936
If you take any paper and you put it in 110 degrees long enough... So you did that?

29:25.976 --> 29:27.738
No, I won't get it this way.

29:27.818 --> 29:33.244
But if you put the book on the sunny side of the room, you've got to expect that this is what's going to happen.

29:33.264 --> 29:40.051
But if you keep it on a lower shelf behind your bed, where it's 68 degrees all the time, it's going to feel not good.

29:40.111 --> 29:47.198
If you put a book in the cellar where it's moist, you're going to have different kinds of things, mildew and... Well, if it's cold enough, you won't get mildew.

29:47.363 --> 29:50.988
It will only happen to be with moist hot.

29:51.008 --> 29:53.733
The best thing for a book is moist cold.

29:54.233 --> 30:03.327
If you look in the English Country House Library on the north side, where it's never been about 60 degrees, it can be 90% humidity in those books that look like they were made yesterday.

30:04.288 --> 30:10.297
But you've got to keep the heat, you've got to keep the temperature up.

30:10.317 --> 30:14.704
And most people don't have the ability to do that because they want to live in nature.

30:15.713 --> 30:27.446
This is one of our major donors, and he buys a whole collection to get a single document, and he's got the rest.

30:27.786 --> 30:34.834
And so that what I'm teaching, oh, then I know what a Frank is.

30:34.874 --> 30:37.137
Well, then I know what a Frank is.

30:37.197 --> 30:38.718
Well, then I know.

30:38.738 --> 30:38.839
Yeah.

30:38.859 --> 30:40.661
So here are Franks, both manuscripts and printages.

30:41.582 --> 30:43.384
Dr. Kennedy's Frank.

30:43.404 --> 30:44.385
Sure.

30:44.405 --> 30:44.725
Oh.

30:45.481 --> 30:48.304
Yeah, I'm sure it's just a form card or something.

30:49.305 --> 30:50.306
Yeah, sure.

30:50.326 --> 30:51.007
That kind of thing.

30:51.027 --> 30:52.269
Sure.

30:52.289 --> 30:52.749
What's that word?

30:52.849 --> 30:53.270
Podlocks?

30:53.530 --> 30:55.292
Nothing.

30:55.312 --> 30:58.596
If you haven't seen it, Frank, it's nice to see one.

30:59.357 --> 31:07.526
And occasionally, and Ken knew this was going to happen, there were some things there that I don't think he would have given me, but the stuff came in 25 boxes.

31:11.150 --> 31:14.914
Received the 17th of December, 1808 of John

31:16.193 --> 31:27.163
Chestnut, $750 in full for three Negro slaves named Clay, Paddy, and their son, Sam.

31:27.504 --> 31:28.004
Amazing.

31:28.024 --> 31:28.985
Isn't it nice?

31:29.005 --> 31:30.286
It's so routine, isn't it?

31:30.326 --> 31:34.030
What happened is somebody died, and this is somebody buying them from the executors.

31:34.510 --> 31:36.652
Yeah, that's a very important piece of that.

31:37.774 --> 31:37.994
Right.

31:38.014 --> 31:42.618
It's common housewives around here, but let me tell you, it shuts my classroom off.

31:42.638 --> 31:44.580
I've got two black kids in my morning class.

31:45.370 --> 31:51.837
This university has got hundreds of documents like this.

31:52.578 --> 32:03.010
Now imagine the mechanics of getting one out to show to a class, and then compare it with what I've got, and you see why I do what I do.

32:03.731 --> 32:05.173
That's a bill of sale.

32:05.233 --> 32:10.539
That's a bill of sale.

32:11.039 --> 32:12.441
I'm surprised Ken passed that on.

32:13.602 --> 32:24.175
African-American collectors would be very interested in that.

32:24.195 --> 32:26.938
Probably small potatoes compared to what he was actually handling.

32:26.958 --> 32:29.922
He dies.

32:30.843 --> 32:31.704
It's out of order.

32:31.824 --> 32:32.866
It was in the process.

32:34.067 --> 32:36.190
Rondell buys it because he knows it's got an X in it.

32:36.310 --> 32:39.694
So he buys it, and his staff goes through and tries to pull out the other stuff.

32:40.298 --> 32:44.824
Well, it gets to a point where it isn't worth the money it's taking, so people decide to look out later.

32:44.844 --> 32:46.006
Ten years goes by.

32:46.707 --> 32:48.389
You can stick a look into the boxes over there.

32:48.730 --> 32:49.851
Send it to Terry.

32:49.871 --> 32:51.834
Send it to Terry, exactly.

32:51.854 --> 32:54.638
But look, I mean, and light it off, probably, too.

32:55.259 --> 32:55.920
Which is fine.

32:56.060 --> 32:56.921
Which is great.

33:00.326 --> 33:05.373
My manuscript collection goes back to the 14th century.

33:06.014 --> 33:08.217
Oh, and there's some fabulous things here.

33:08.718 --> 33:09.799
Again, we're in Del Seno.

33:10.032 --> 33:12.896
This, for example, is one of everybody's favorites.

33:12.916 --> 33:13.537
I can find it.

33:14.138 --> 33:22.811
Most of these are just scraps, but they're 14th century scraps.

33:23.452 --> 33:28.440
Would you say that you have anything here at research depth, or is it largely specimen depth?

33:28.580 --> 33:33.728
Well, if it's at research depth, it's really there only by accident.

33:33.788 --> 33:37.373
There is one thing in here, if I can find it.

33:37.825 --> 33:46.774
There's a contract between the citizens of Siena and the mercenaries they have just hired for their defense.

33:46.794 --> 33:48.635
That's crazy.

33:48.716 --> 33:52.780
Now that's what Albert Gerwin-Lady teaches.

33:52.960 --> 33:55.142
Because I can't even read the alphabet.

33:55.262 --> 33:57.104
It's on level in the box.

33:59.446 --> 34:00.047
Look at that.

34:00.487 --> 34:03.950
Is that vellum?

34:05.552 --> 34:05.672
Yeah.

34:10.782 --> 34:11.082
How old?

34:11.102 --> 34:13.685
1334s I was looking at?

34:13.785 --> 34:15.026
Yeah.

34:15.587 --> 34:18.170
It's an Italian contract for the defense of the city.

34:18.190 --> 34:19.611
That's all I knew when it came to me.

34:20.672 --> 34:22.594
And look, it might be worth a couple hundred bucks.

34:23.836 --> 34:24.256
I don't know.

34:25.237 --> 34:27.279
Nobody's done any research on it, you see, so you don't know.

34:27.299 --> 34:29.762
I mean, Alba Derwey, who could read it, said it's Siena.

34:29.782 --> 34:36.369
That's the worst I knew that, because I can't read the alphabet here well enough to pick out the word Siena in the contract, and I bet you you can't either.

34:36.629 --> 34:38.631
No, don't even bother.

34:38.651 --> 34:39.372
And I read that.

34:39.875 --> 34:55.720
because that was done months later, and there's somebody's... I mean, not exactly speaking off the record, but let's get right down to it.

34:56.241 --> 35:02.811
This is the best place of this kind that everyone wants anywhere, and everybody will tell you that.

35:03.533 --> 35:08.281
It's not the largest or best collection of anything, but it's the most accessible collection that we've got.

35:08.561 --> 35:11.186
As I say, like that slave thing, I mean, there's nothing unusual about that.

35:11.206 --> 35:14.972
You buy one for $55, or maybe a little more, a hundred bucks.

35:18.558 --> 35:23.185
And what I'm trying to do is, I mean, look, this is not exactly teaching on the internet, is it?

35:24.608 --> 35:30.317
I mean, it's not an efficient way to teach, but it's a better way to teach.

35:30.753 --> 35:33.416
Sophie Tucker, I've been rich and I've been poor, and it's just better.

35:34.077 --> 35:36.380
I mean, it's better to have these documents in your hand.

35:36.400 --> 35:39.444
You see students picking them up and their fingers start to shake.

35:41.687 --> 35:42.488
And that's what I want.

35:42.568 --> 35:44.730
I mean, it's what high-class education is all about.

35:45.992 --> 35:47.214
That's what they get at Harvard, too.

35:48.936 --> 35:50.378
How did you develop the idea for this?

35:51.599 --> 35:52.600
What were you teaching me?

35:52.620 --> 35:53.381
I mean, is this?

35:53.401 --> 35:53.882
Okay.

35:53.902 --> 35:54.803
So I start out.

35:58.833 --> 35:59.474
I got a Ph.D.

35:59.494 --> 36:01.356
in English, 1970, Columbia.

36:04.340 --> 36:28.671
In 1970, there is about to be no work of any kind whatsoever for white male 18th century English specialists.

36:29.360 --> 36:37.749
So while I'm wondering what the hell I'm going to do with my life, with my brand new PhD, one of my dissertation sponsors had a heart attack.

36:40.352 --> 36:44.116
He taught in a library school, and I was invited to take over one of his courses at no notice.

36:45.097 --> 36:56.450
I suddenly found myself teaching humanities reference literature, a subject in which I was basically completely without any knowledge whatsoever.

36:57.431 --> 36:58.012
Thank you.

36:58.032 --> 36:59.113
Thank you.

36:59.347 --> 37:07.418
to a bunch of graduate students in the library school.

37:08.299 --> 37:10.782
One thing led to another.

37:13.225 --> 37:19.253
I was invited to take over the rest of Alan Hazen's courses, one of which was a course in descriptive bibliography.

37:20.615 --> 37:28.746
And the year after that, 71, 72, 73, I was offered a full-time appointment.

37:29.671 --> 37:35.096
in the library school with a brief to develop a rare book program, a subject in which I yet had very little knowledge.

37:35.196 --> 37:41.662
But I had done my dissertation on the 18th century loan and book trade in the English department.

37:42.984 --> 37:45.746
And my biography is on the internet.

37:46.447 --> 37:50.311
Just look at my webpage, which is old books.

37:50.351 --> 37:52.292
You know, you've got the address.

37:52.312 --> 37:57.197
I don't know if you ever looked at my webpage, but there's the equivalent of a nine-page book.

37:57.481 --> 37:59.724
resume for me with a prose somewhere.

37:59.764 --> 38:00.946
Then don't bother.

38:05.612 --> 38:11.421
So there I was at Columbia with a brief to set up a program in rare books, and there really wasn't any training for rare books in those days.

38:12.122 --> 38:27.403
You get a library degree, but it was assumed that you either brought to the library degree your doctorate, and you learned technical stuff in library school about cataloging and such like, and then you went off and got a job where you used

38:28.852 --> 38:30.514
your subject expertise.

38:32.696 --> 38:42.007
Or, um, if it was a job like rare book cataloging where you really didn't need to learn the rules.

38:43.729 --> 38:53.781
And, uh, I mean, I have one, I think, true genius, as I've told you before, self-promotion.

38:53.801 --> 38:56.344
And I began, uh,

38:58.349 --> 39:10.320
advertising the fact that Columbia was offering a formal program for training in rare books, the first astonishing thing that happened is that would-be antiquarian booksellers began applying for it.

39:10.420 --> 39:11.962
And you didn't expect that at all, by the way?

39:11.982 --> 39:12.663
It crossed my mind.

39:14.204 --> 39:17.968
And now Jeffrey Mansevice, you must know, ask him.

39:17.988 --> 39:19.209
He's a former student.

39:20.490 --> 39:26.736
He went to Columbia because he was interested in training in rare books, not because he was interested in getting a library degree, which he has.

39:29.838 --> 39:36.486
Not on purpose, but simply by completing his courses, he ended up with one.

39:36.506 --> 39:38.648
Or Bruce McKittrick, if you run up against him.

39:41.711 --> 39:47.758
Or David Warrington in the Harvard Law Library, who spent a long time working for Rendell.

39:48.139 --> 39:49.861
Did Rob Moulin-Miller go?

39:50.301 --> 39:50.481
No.

39:52.103 --> 39:52.404
Never did.

39:52.864 --> 39:53.725
He worked for his father.

39:55.327 --> 39:58.090
I didn't know how he got into the very last year.

39:58.694 --> 40:03.640
was a successful businessman who retired and set up a railroad business.

40:03.780 --> 40:10.628
They're rich, real rich, by standards of most of us.

40:11.149 --> 40:13.071
Rich and is rich, in other words.

40:13.091 --> 40:15.414
Wrong.

40:15.654 --> 40:18.677
Rob's got a 30-room house on Summit Avenue in St.

40:18.738 --> 40:19.078
Falls.

40:19.138 --> 40:20.480
That's pretty rich.

40:24.765 --> 40:25.886
Why is it that I sense that?

40:28.269 --> 40:28.549
I don't know.

40:29.187 --> 40:32.331
Well, I mean, he's already a very senior figure with the ILAB.

40:32.351 --> 40:33.432
I mean, at such a young age.

40:34.493 --> 40:38.058
And he really is dealing in some pretty interesting books.

40:38.078 --> 40:38.779
He's a nice guy.

40:38.939 --> 40:40.120
And he's a very nice guy.

40:40.281 --> 40:41.042
He's older than he looks.

40:41.062 --> 40:42.003
He must be in his 40s.

40:42.343 --> 40:42.583
Really?

40:43.004 --> 40:43.104
Yeah.

40:43.124 --> 40:44.666
He looks like a baby face.

40:44.966 --> 40:47.349
I've known him for 20 years, so he pretty much has to be.

40:51.594 --> 40:52.075
What is this?

40:52.095 --> 40:52.676
This is great.

40:53.557 --> 40:56.120
It's just seltzer water.

40:56.160 --> 40:56.781
Seltzer water.

40:58.183 --> 40:58.603
Wonderful.

41:01.267 --> 41:02.208
So to Columbia.

41:04.310 --> 41:06.451
You know, I did my work, and I taught my service courses.

41:07.372 --> 41:15.419
And I began teaching, and it occurred to me that I didn't have anything to teach with.

41:18.481 --> 41:21.404
I mean, I got sick of teaching from slides.

41:23.826 --> 41:26.908
And there was a big variable library at Columbia, but it wasn't very easy to use.

41:26.989 --> 41:31.172
It was upstairs, and there was no teaching room in Special Collections.

41:31.979 --> 41:32.900
There was no problem at all.

41:32.920 --> 41:36.765
You could send any individual student out to look at any book, and they'd show it to them gladly.

41:37.385 --> 41:39.087
But they did not want to see me with a glass.

41:40.809 --> 41:48.298
Well, it wasn't the world's most public access-oriented department either, to be sure.

41:48.318 --> 41:51.122
See, it's funny how you came into this.

41:51.202 --> 41:52.683
You came in in a very different way.

41:55.387 --> 42:00.012
I mean, you almost by accident come into the antiquarian book world, don't you?

42:02.793 --> 42:10.681
I've never... Had you not trained as a librarian, either?

42:12.323 --> 42:14.725
No, I never worked a day in my life in the library as a bookseller.

42:15.386 --> 42:17.008
But I know something about the physical book.

42:17.248 --> 42:25.036
And look, what I am in this business, I'm Marcus Welby, only not as good-tempered.

42:26.157 --> 42:30.842
I'm the GP, but I'm a good GP, and I know

42:31.447 --> 42:32.489
You've got troubles.

42:32.970 --> 42:34.432
I know the specialist to send you to.

42:34.452 --> 42:42.025
And I really do think that people will agree that the Rare Book School faculty is good beyond hope.

42:43.107 --> 42:46.252
I mean, some of these people are teaching in an environment.

42:46.713 --> 42:48.696
This is like Chopin teaching scales.

42:49.517 --> 42:50.900
People say that in evaluations.

42:51.000 --> 42:54.265
I am embarrassed to be taught by somebody with this distinction.

42:54.285 --> 42:56.509
I do not deserve instruction in this quality.

42:58.312 --> 43:11.252
And when Albert Dirillet is teaching you how to identify Sienna in a manuscript like that, since he is probably the best-known codicologist of his age, which is 60-something.

43:11.653 --> 43:14.497
I mean, codicologists like conductors seem to live forever.

43:15.238 --> 43:17.822
Now, what is it that Jake does in Colorado?

43:17.842 --> 43:18.744
Is that similar?

43:22.790 --> 43:23.391
No.

43:26.408 --> 43:27.289
I'm not going to quote you.

43:27.309 --> 43:27.970
I'm just curious.

43:28.210 --> 43:29.652
What Jake does is excellent.

43:38.905 --> 43:46.676
But the school that trains scuba divers in Florida is going to be very different from the school that trains mountain climbers in Idaho.

43:46.696 --> 43:47.957
That's all.

43:47.977 --> 43:50.821
Jake has 80 people for a week every year.

43:51.783 --> 43:54.947
I have 300 people over a four-week period.

43:55.923 --> 43:57.284
So I'm five times the size.

43:57.965 --> 44:01.328
That's the first difference.

44:01.348 --> 44:10.456
The second difference is that he has a bunch of talking heads that take turns addressing 80 people.

44:12.238 --> 44:15.221
I know I've been one of them, and they're very good people.

44:16.182 --> 44:21.587
At Gray Book School, my talking heads address no more than 12 people at a time.

44:22.087 --> 44:23.989
Jake's course is about how to sell

44:24.813 --> 44:27.876
used books, used and antiquarian books, but mostly used, really.

44:27.916 --> 44:28.597
It's OP.

44:30.539 --> 44:32.400
It's called the OP and Used Book Seminar.

44:32.460 --> 44:34.242
I don't think rare is even in the title.

44:35.784 --> 44:37.225
And it's very good.

44:37.946 --> 44:42.070
The people who go there are people who want to be used booksellers.

44:42.230 --> 44:46.914
Yours is more of a scholarly approach, I think, as well.

44:46.975 --> 44:50.378
Because it's a professional or even a business approach.

44:50.458 --> 44:52.660
When you come here for a week to take

44:55.272 --> 44:59.958
medieval and early Renaissance bookbinding structure, for example.

45:00.499 --> 45:04.284
This is an intellectual pursuit as much as anything else.

45:08.810 --> 45:16.481
Bookbinders and conservators and booksellers take Nicholas Piccolo's course all the time because they're selling books.

45:17.282 --> 45:23.490
His course is European bookbinding's 1500-1800, but he never mentions decorations.

45:25.192 --> 45:27.175
He's interested in structure.

45:27.195 --> 45:28.837
If it's bound this way, it's German.

45:29.558 --> 45:31.381
If it's got that kind of a head cap, it's Italian.

45:31.481 --> 45:35.847
If it's on goat skin rather than sheep skin, then it's almost certainly Belgian, that kind of thing.

45:37.570 --> 45:44.881
And dealers take this because if they know it's a Belgian binding as opposed to a binding, then it's worth more.

45:44.901 --> 45:47.564
And Nicholas's course is sold out.

45:47.605 --> 45:52.752
Nicholas has offered that course 17 times in the past 10 years, and every one of them is sold out.

45:53.575 --> 46:23.548
teaching it again this winter because I'm trying to catch up from my backlog since the point of this operation is to get people into courses not to keep them out of it and I'm embarrassed by because most of the people are working professionals if you have a six person waiting list it'll be a 12 person waiting list next year because the conditions that produced 18 people for 12 places will go on doing it so now I mean I feel like a coat of paint would be fine

46:23.680 --> 46:30.386
I am maintaining one of the country's principal exhibition programs and the only one in the country that deals with undergraduates at all.

46:30.546 --> 46:35.730
So far as I know, Dan Miller's show is the only serious undergraduate show done in this country in 15 years.

46:35.831 --> 46:36.531
So where is that?

46:36.992 --> 46:37.472
Where is his?

46:38.573 --> 46:42.436
Dan Miller did the ASC show, the Armed Services Edition show.

46:43.057 --> 46:47.261
Now, have you read his piece on it, that autobiographical piece that I sent you?

46:47.281 --> 46:49.402
Oh, the piece you did send me, okay, yes, I did.

46:49.683 --> 46:50.423
All right, I'm sorry.

46:50.443 --> 46:52.885
He was talking about how to do a show and how he learned how to do a show?

46:52.945 --> 46:53.586
Yep, yep, yep.

46:54.730 --> 47:00.856
Well, you can't have undergraduates do major shows.

47:00.876 --> 47:01.777
They're like mayflies.

47:02.737 --> 47:06.561
In the first place, most librarians don't know any undergraduates.

47:06.581 --> 47:10.845
And when they do, they're people they've hired to work in their departments, but they weren't hired to do exhibitions.

47:11.325 --> 47:12.526
They're hired to photocopy.

47:15.029 --> 47:20.094
And so it's hard to identify a promising or interested undergraduate and to negotiate.

47:20.594 --> 47:23.877
Now, I'm not a member, I'm not a library employee.

47:24.211 --> 47:28.016
I don't have, as you know, because I'm a university professor, I don't have any job description.

47:28.036 --> 47:28.877
I can do what I please.

47:31.760 --> 47:36.907
My only formal requirement is a one-page annual report.

47:37.447 --> 47:44.897
But I've got students, and I'm in a library, so that I can encourage students to do shows, simply because they're interested in I am.

47:45.718 --> 47:48.061
And Miller did that as an independent study course.

47:48.081 --> 47:51.345
While I'm a professor type, I can conduct independent studies.

47:53.087 --> 47:53.948
And I want to develop

47:55.413 --> 48:06.164
a systematic program where my very lively undergraduates, as you saw from Darby, who's a charming young woman, I'm going to see another batch at 2 o'clock.

48:08.526 --> 48:10.268
I wanted them to do shows.

48:10.288 --> 48:12.210
I mean, this is what you can do for people.

48:12.890 --> 48:20.678
Miller's show was up during his graduation, so we had a reception here so his parents and friends could see it at graduation time.

48:21.788 --> 48:25.954
Because he did the show, he got a job working as a writer.

48:29.619 --> 48:42.017
And he wanted to go bum around the country for a summer, but he was careful to apply only for jobs that he couldn't get to please his parents, which was a mistake, because he got it.

48:44.780 --> 48:50.108
When he was a senior year, a fourth year student, he applied to every major

48:50.830 --> 48:53.793
really major graduate program in 20th century American history.

48:53.813 --> 48:59.859
I didn't get into any of them because he was competing with people like him now.

49:01.261 --> 49:03.343
He's not 22 without any credentials.

49:03.363 --> 49:04.023
He's 24.

49:04.083 --> 49:05.605
He's worked for Kaiser for two years.

49:05.745 --> 49:06.726
He's got a publication.

49:09.789 --> 49:10.370
He's been around.

49:12.352 --> 49:18.218
I gave a speech in the Rotunda.

49:18.238 --> 49:20.500
Well, on top of that,

49:21.745 --> 49:22.446
I maintain that.

49:22.466 --> 49:24.768
I mean, I've got a full-time staff, too.

49:26.269 --> 49:30.914
One full-time and then various volunteers and part-time people for 11 months of the year.

49:33.356 --> 49:46.288
And I get by a more or less systematic program of exploitation of people like Catalato and Bill Royal who come in and volunteer for me.

49:46.849 --> 49:51.313
But volunteering is no joke because what volunteers want is your time.

49:52.087 --> 49:55.712
Cal and I spent several hours yesterday putting these together.

49:55.813 --> 49:57.555
Did he give you one of those yet?

49:57.575 --> 49:58.216
No.

49:58.236 --> 49:59.238
You've got one tonight at dinner.

49:59.398 --> 50:02.282
Take one now so you can put it with your stuff and you don't have to worry about it.

50:02.783 --> 50:04.045
It's the exhibition catalog.

50:04.085 --> 50:05.867
Oh, great.

50:05.888 --> 50:07.590
I asked him if he was doing a catalog.

50:07.670 --> 50:08.531
He said yes.

50:08.592 --> 50:13.058
He said we'll have one tonight.

50:13.078 --> 50:14.180
Yeah, take one and then we'll.

50:14.240 --> 50:18.146
Thank you.

50:18.266 --> 50:18.807
Excellent.

50:18.827 --> 50:21.030
I've got my phone, my stuff.

50:21.601 --> 50:23.863
So what was it that sold Virginia on this?

50:24.864 --> 50:27.226
Did this feed into anything that they had?

50:27.286 --> 50:30.409
Were they historically involved in?

50:30.670 --> 50:34.173
Virginia is a very usual place, obviously.

50:37.356 --> 50:41.520
I mean, this is a very history conscious part of the world, as you know.

50:42.401 --> 50:48.807
And because of the Barrett collection, and thank you very much.

50:49.411 --> 50:54.478
And also because of the McGregor collection, the Barrett collection is in the McGregor room.

50:56.861 --> 51:01.067
It really is one of the principal resources for the study of American literature and history.

51:01.348 --> 51:02.970
Thank you.

51:03.871 --> 51:05.674
It cannot compete with Harvard manuscripts.

51:06.995 --> 51:11.301
And Harvard has the country's principal collection of American literary manuscripts.

51:12.463 --> 51:18.912
But I think Harvard would agree that we have the nation's principal collection of American printed literature.

51:19.195 --> 51:20.777
pretty much acknowledged anything.

51:20.797 --> 51:26.643
Because Harvard and Yale and the public and L.C.

51:26.743 --> 51:28.986
tended to buy the books when they came in and they'd been used up.

51:30.167 --> 51:33.911
Where ours came in, in collector's condition, within the past 30 years.

51:36.154 --> 51:38.476
And Barrett went out and bought new copies of all these books.

51:40.499 --> 51:43.182
Now, this isn't to say that Barrett didn't have manuscripts.

51:43.442 --> 51:46.165
He went from a collection that has the manuscripts of the Leaves of Grass

51:46.550 --> 51:50.895
the manuscript of the Red Badge of Courage, the manuscript of Walden.

51:52.076 --> 51:53.037
He's not all bad.

51:54.519 --> 52:01.486
And Kevin Dell says that when he was first starting in business, Barrett used to buy from him, and a Barrett invoice.

52:01.727 --> 52:04.229
These are monthly invoices, typically with 50 pages.

52:04.249 --> 52:12.979
You know, a letter from Sarah Horn Jewett.

52:13.330 --> 52:17.094
$18.59, $10, that kind of stuff, and people barely read them.

52:17.134 --> 52:18.055
The stuff was so cheap.

52:18.555 --> 52:23.260
It wasn't worth, barely worth selling, although $10 was worth more than it is now.

52:25.001 --> 52:25.862
There was a lot of that.

52:26.503 --> 52:27.343
It was still a steal.

52:28.304 --> 52:37.934
I don't know if she was a canonical author at that particular point either, but, well, she's more now, certainly.

52:37.954 --> 52:39.355
And she wasn't, I think.

52:40.043 --> 52:43.247
But Barrett collected everybody in BAL and a good many people besides.

52:44.328 --> 52:46.030
And that's 300 writers right there.

52:46.130 --> 52:47.312
Well, that was one of his focus.

52:47.852 --> 52:48.894
Yeah.

52:49.094 --> 52:51.297
His focus was to get the second tier.

52:51.457 --> 52:51.817
That's right.

52:51.877 --> 52:52.858
And third and fourth.

52:52.898 --> 52:53.299
That's right.

52:54.721 --> 52:55.922
He liked multiple coffees.

52:57.484 --> 52:58.826
He liked coffees in good condition.

53:01.509 --> 53:03.231
He liked to describe coffees.

53:06.495 --> 53:06.675
Great.

53:12.798 --> 53:18.906
You'd be interested to know, maybe, that the genius behind my coming here is the same genius behind the E-Tech Center.

53:20.288 --> 53:27.937
It's the associate librarian of this library, and his name is Kendon Stubbs, S-T-U-B-B-S.

53:28.798 --> 53:33.044
He's also the genius who, 20 years ago, was behind the building of the Common Press upstairs.

53:37.409 --> 53:39.912
What was he, Stubbs?

53:39.932 --> 53:41.134
Associate librarian.

53:41.418 --> 53:43.360
He's an inside man, not an outside man.

53:44.081 --> 53:46.264
He was an acting librarian.

53:46.284 --> 53:50.789
Well, Karen Wittenborg, who is the librarian, remember the name, because you'll meet her later, I'm sure.

53:51.490 --> 54:03.544
She's planning to come to the reception and lecture, and she'll come to dinner if she doesn't get a better offer, which means if one of her major donors shows up, then she will disappear, because that's what you do.

54:04.024 --> 54:09.771
She spends three quarters of her time raising money, and has raised, I think, 16 million bucks in the past three years.

54:11.270 --> 54:11.691
How much?

54:11.951 --> 54:12.151
16.

54:12.171 --> 54:13.232
That's pretty good.

54:13.653 --> 54:19.340
When she says she has to go buy somebody dinner, it's not because she thinks it's going to be a better dinner.

54:21.622 --> 54:25.487
But Stubbs works for Wittenborg, and Stubbs is terrific.

54:25.527 --> 54:26.428
He's not a diplomat.

54:26.488 --> 54:29.452
He's not an ambassador.

54:31.154 --> 54:32.736
He's a librarian.

54:33.677 --> 54:34.138
He's a librarian.

54:34.158 --> 54:35.079
Yeah.

54:35.099 --> 54:35.780
He's very clever.

54:36.540 --> 54:37.041
He's very good.

54:37.477 --> 54:41.462
and he sees entrepreneurial opportunities, and he saw me as one.

54:43.185 --> 54:52.618
Kathy Morgan, the curator of rare books here, went to him, thereby, and we won't say this, obviously, she went right over her boss's head.

54:53.920 --> 54:56.343
Her boss was a bit on the conservative side.

54:57.565 --> 55:05.155
She went over her boss's head and asked Stubbs if he could find money for the university to invite me to come down and explore possibilities.

55:05.793 --> 55:08.275
And so he put up $450 to bring me here.

55:08.296 --> 55:09.156
And export your what, I'm sorry?

55:09.497 --> 55:09.997
What did you say?

55:10.077 --> 55:10.718
And export?

55:11.379 --> 55:12.740
And export possibilities.

55:12.840 --> 55:14.121
Oh, okay.

55:14.141 --> 55:14.241
Okay.

55:14.261 --> 55:17.305
So they brought me down, and I was here for three days, and I met everybody.

55:18.306 --> 55:35.783
Kathy simply made appointments for me with everybody she thought might be interested in my coming here, the dean of the continuing ed school, the head of the library, the associate provost,

55:36.927 --> 55:45.298
And most significant of these, it turned out, the dean of the School of Arts and Sciences, somebody that Kathy had never met and didn't know.

55:46.019 --> 55:48.142
She'd only been here four months herself at the time.

55:48.943 --> 55:51.447
Well, that was Ray Nelson, and Ray Nelson is a book collector.

55:52.348 --> 55:57.815
And Ray had never heard of my program, so he went over and he talked to Paul Collins at Hartwood.

55:58.796 --> 56:01.520
And Paul, who I'd also never met at the time, knew all about them.

56:04.404 --> 56:05.145
And the result was,

56:06.644 --> 56:15.455
that after talking with Nelson for 45 minutes on the spot, he said that he thought that the appropriate place for me to come here would be as a university professor.

56:17.718 --> 56:20.682
And I said, quite honestly, I said, that is aiming too high.

56:24.627 --> 56:27.791
But he said, he said, basically, I don't think so.

56:27.831 --> 56:28.872
But what he meant was,

56:29.678 --> 56:36.705
that the dean of the faculty, powerful though he is, cannot put somebody into a department, and many deans have failed in their attempts to do that.

56:37.626 --> 56:40.949
The only people who can put somebody into a department is the department.

56:41.609 --> 56:51.519
When there's an opening in the English department, neither the president nor the provost nor the board of visitors will have much luck in trying to impose somebody into a department if the department is against it.

56:54.001 --> 56:58.285
But a university professor has no department and theoretically reports directly to the president.

56:59.581 --> 57:06.468
And it is the one kind of professor that the dean and the provost and the president can make quite easily because it doesn't require departmental approval.

57:07.970 --> 57:25.588
On the other hand, you start making very many of them and you've got chaos because it means you've got all these loose cannon floating around who report to nobody and who don't have any services and therefore will have to be dealt with directly out of the president or provost or dean's office.

57:27.104 --> 57:29.868
And when I want a paperclip, I have to go to the dean of the faculty for it.

57:31.690 --> 57:54.580
And because I have no department secretary, I have no department, I have no department chair, and I also, so basically the assumption is with people like me, Richard Rorty is probably the other university professor around here, the philosopher that you might have heard of, and certainly much more distinguished than I am.

57:55.792 --> 57:59.637
You know, he's the kind of guy that gets his picture on the front page of the New York Times Sunday Magazine.

58:00.558 --> 58:01.359
What's his name?

58:01.379 --> 58:03.421
Richard Rorty, R-O-R-T-Y.

58:03.922 --> 58:12.312
He's a philosopher, but he's interested in pragmatism when nobody else is, so he likes to teach in English departments who are interested in pragmatism because philosophers aren't.

58:12.332 --> 58:14.875
That's funny.

58:14.895 --> 58:23.605
And, well, I thought basically that Nelson was making conversation, but he wasn't, and I think

58:24.057 --> 58:25.719
I think we struck it right.

58:25.759 --> 58:30.224
I think he'd had a long week in which he had not been able to do a single thing that he wanted to do.

58:32.126 --> 58:37.813
And I came along, and he thought, if we invite him to come here, maybe this would be a more interesting place as regards books.

58:39.615 --> 58:52.309
And the dean of the faculty now, Nick Nelson's retired, told me at the time, he was then chairman of the history department, Mel Leffler, L-E-F-F-L-E-R, good fellow, who writes on

58:52.593 --> 58:54.996
Nazi Germany won a Bancroft a couple of years ago.

58:56.938 --> 59:10.774
Butler said, you may be interested to know that Ray Nelson consulted all of us chairmen when he proposed to make a new university professor, and it would have been very stupid of him not to, he said.

59:11.415 --> 59:16.721
On the other hand, he said, it would have been very stupid of us not to agree.

59:16.741 --> 59:21.326
But there are only all of us.

59:21.346 --> 59:22.347
I think there are only two

59:23.187 --> 59:25.630
university professors in the humanities who teach.

59:26.631 --> 59:29.534
There are some others who used to teach, but they're now administrator types.

59:30.435 --> 59:32.597
I think there are about a dozen at the university in all.

59:33.518 --> 59:41.427
And most of those are in the professional schools because the law school has so much money and power that what else have they got to offer anybody?

59:42.988 --> 59:44.910
As a university professor, I have no fixed duties.

59:45.010 --> 59:46.011
I teach what I want to.

59:46.792 --> 59:51.237
I get a sabbatical every three and a half years instead of after every seven, which is meaningless to me.

59:52.212 --> 59:54.095
I can't take sabbatical, so I ain't got a house to run.

59:57.140 --> 59:58.523
But nobody's counting, that's for sure.

59:59.444 --> 01:00:01.267
And they gave me a license to raise money.

01:00:02.289 --> 01:00:08.319
I was, I'm sorry, coffee?

01:00:08.359 --> 01:00:08.640
Almost.

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:11.565
You get a class, you know.

01:00:11.585 --> 01:00:12.246
Learn.
