00:03.136 --> 00:08.203
Congratulations on a really, very profoundly moving book, I have to say.

00:08.664 --> 00:09.185
Thank you.

00:10.186 --> 00:16.976
I read it in one sitting, which is probably the way it's meant to be read, would you think?

00:18.539 --> 00:28.073
Well, that shows, if you do that, that shows an enormous interest.

00:28.133 --> 00:31.658
I know when I read a book in one sitting, it's because I can't put it down, so that's

00:32.110 --> 00:37.379
wonderful, but I guess whatever way you read it would be.

00:37.619 --> 00:42.387
I hadn't really thought of how it would be for the reader.

00:42.427 --> 00:58.894
Yeah, well, I know, of course, I read a lot of books, and I do it professionally, but there just seemed to be a continuity here, an incremental kind of a power that just seemed

01:00.123 --> 01:01.946
appropriate to read it that way.

01:01.986 --> 01:04.049
That's just an opening comment.

01:04.569 --> 01:29.505
And, of course, in preparing for this interview, I read as much background as I could on your night, and I'm struck by the use of the name Richardson here for the narrator, and I gather that name has some resonance in your own life, and I wonder if you can trust yourself to that.

01:31.865 --> 01:59.914
I tend to use the names that have a certain kind of rhythm to it, and so far the only names that, or some of the names I've used were family names, because they seemed right, but they're not...

02:02.797 --> 02:09.928
They're not about the people, the names are apart from it.

02:09.948 --> 02:15.277
They have only kind of rhythmic resonance for me, a kind of meter.

02:16.178 --> 02:26.955
And I didn't know what other name to really call a person from, that kind of person I was writing about from that part of the world.

02:26.995 --> 02:28.618
I'm not so familiar with

02:29.358 --> 02:35.027
I'm only familiar with these places through my family, so I tend to use family names.

02:35.047 --> 02:41.518
So one should not infer anything from the use of that name, other than the fact that it was a convenient name for you to use?

02:41.538 --> 02:42.579
Yes, that's right.

02:42.600 --> 02:42.860
That's right.

02:42.880 --> 02:55.260
I mean, because you certainly are... The people who read you critically have observed that you do write a lot of autobiographical... Autobiographical.

02:55.280 --> 02:56.462
Yes, that's quite true.

02:56.712 --> 03:00.395
And perhaps you could address yourself to that in the writing of this book.

03:00.415 --> 03:11.104
Well, you know, the name, for instance, the name Lucy, there isn't anybody in my family named Lucy, but it derived from Lucifer.

03:11.485 --> 03:25.757
And it, all of the myths attached to Lucifer, which I know primarily from Paradise Lost,

03:26.108 --> 03:38.120
That was all part of her story, identifying with a rebellious character and being tossed out of paradigm and so on.

03:38.200 --> 03:44.686
So the name Lucy made sense, but there's nobody I knew, no.

03:45.246 --> 03:48.349
It's just that it made sense in that way.

03:48.369 --> 03:51.893
But then her other names were my names.

03:53.074 --> 03:55.356
But again, they had an explanation.

03:55.842 --> 03:58.024
Well, that's superficial, too, I think.

03:58.224 --> 04:08.833
But in the deeper sense of autobiographical writing, would you suggest that this is gone?

04:08.913 --> 04:11.796
This particular one, no, because I'm not 70 years old.

04:11.916 --> 04:12.516
Of course, yeah.

04:12.536 --> 04:13.557
It's only autobiographical.

04:14.038 --> 04:20.904
But, of course, the title of the autobiography of my mother, which we do get on the very last page, where you make clear why you use that title.

04:21.344 --> 04:23.566
It could be somebody from your family.

04:23.606 --> 04:24.887
I mean, just looking at it.

04:25.103 --> 04:26.905
Yes, it could be.

04:27.265 --> 04:41.118
It's autobiographical in the sense that I know, I've known women, a woman or women like that, but it's not in the real meaning of autobiography.

04:41.258 --> 04:43.841
It's not me.

04:43.861 --> 04:47.044
But I know the situation I wrote about very well.

04:49.166 --> 04:54.891
I love the advice of the picture kind of emerging.

04:55.377 --> 05:23.258
before prior to each chapter we see you know yeah we have it yeah and segments was this your idea yeah visually it really is quite a nice device isn't it she's quite brilliant it shows quite a quite an interesting reading of the of the novel i think so i think so yes it was um kind of amazing uh to see yeah and is this a photograph of a of a caribbean woman yes it is a woman actually i um it's a

05:23.812 --> 05:28.936
a tourist postcard from Martinique, I think, of 1930.

05:28.957 --> 05:29.097
Uh-huh.

05:29.197 --> 05:38.245
And in your mind's eye, is this kind of what this woman... Do you visualize your characters?

05:38.645 --> 05:40.787
Do you have visual images of them?

05:40.807 --> 05:41.628
Oh, well, yes.

05:41.788 --> 05:43.449
Oh, absolutely, yes.

05:44.310 --> 05:46.192
She fits fairly close.

05:46.252 --> 05:47.713
I wasn't thinking of that.

05:49.595 --> 05:52.317
I've had that postcard for a long time.

05:52.837 --> 05:57.663
Someone gave it to me on my 25th birthday, actually, with a present, and I kept it.

06:00.967 --> 06:07.955
Yes, she's a person of, I suspect, an African, European, and Carib Indian background.

06:08.436 --> 06:09.957
Her face looks familiar.

06:10.999 --> 06:22.152
As a young woman, with a great body of work ahead of you, how was it for you to

06:22.621 --> 06:31.148
characterize, I mean, to put yourself in the skin of a 70-year-old woman and to write from that kind of a perspective.

06:31.209 --> 06:33.310
I'm just asking, you know, creatively.

06:33.631 --> 06:33.871
Oh.

06:34.251 --> 06:35.132
A creative question.

06:35.753 --> 06:39.095
I mean, you don't mind if we don't get into the substance of the book too much.

06:39.135 --> 06:41.017
That's my job, of course, to read it.

06:42.118 --> 06:45.521
But we are just kind of going to look.

06:45.541 --> 06:46.262
Yes.

06:47.223 --> 06:47.483
How was it?

06:47.503 --> 06:47.623
When?

06:47.643 --> 06:50.686
It must have been quite a challenge, I would have to believe, or perhaps not.

06:51.026 --> 06:51.126
Well,

06:55.747 --> 06:58.710
I hope I'm not coming down with something.

07:00.512 --> 07:05.738
It wasn't any more of a challenge than writing on the whole.

07:05.758 --> 07:10.463
It was hard.

07:11.944 --> 07:12.545
We're doing fine.

07:12.565 --> 07:14.087
I'd just like to check myself.

07:14.107 --> 07:16.850
Every once in a while I'd be very anxious about machines.

07:16.870 --> 07:19.352
I know, everybody does.

07:21.254 --> 07:23.677
But the difficulty wasn't that part.

07:23.717 --> 07:24.758
The difficulty was just

07:25.328 --> 07:38.607
getting the whole tone of it and the whole detail of it correct, and the voice correct, the sweep of it correct.

07:38.707 --> 07:43.694
Because it has a sort of wide mythic sweep, but it's a very small book.

07:45.016 --> 07:51.846
Speaking of the voice, when you started, did you see the voice?

07:52.747 --> 07:55.251
Did you see the narration beginning?

07:55.957 --> 08:00.824
from the standpoint of a 70-year-old woman recalling you in the events?

08:01.024 --> 08:01.545
Oh, yes.

08:01.745 --> 08:03.568
It began, yes.

08:04.809 --> 08:09.756
Did the voice kind of come to you, or did you hear it, or...?

08:09.776 --> 08:12.420
No, I was thinking about it.

08:13.221 --> 08:24.597
The women I knew, who are my mother's age, and who are fairly impressive and powerful

08:25.049 --> 08:36.702
women, and I just, you know, would mediate my way through many things to their voice.

08:37.403 --> 08:42.728
But it wasn't, no, it didn't come to me.

08:42.768 --> 08:48.795
I mean, it was a real process of elimination of thinking.

08:52.252 --> 08:55.577
Do you see your body of work as a body of work?

08:56.298 --> 08:56.679
No.

08:57.220 --> 08:57.620
You don't.

08:57.660 --> 09:11.161
No, because I wouldn't dream of thinking of myself in quite such a grand way.

09:11.221 --> 09:13.504
I think others are.

09:13.705 --> 09:15.948
Well, they can.

09:17.771 --> 09:20.655
I'm very flattered that anyone would.

09:21.074 --> 09:41.960
would see it that way, but I just, you know, I write one book, and I write another, and then I write another, and I'm sure they're all connected, because they're all written by the same person, and I'm sure they have similar themes, and even similar sentences, but I don't see it as one at all.

09:42.020 --> 09:43.602
I couldn't, it would overwhelm me.

09:44.463 --> 09:46.625
You don't see these books as statements, do you?

09:46.745 --> 09:48.147
Let me put that in a final question.

09:48.167 --> 09:50.490
Do you see these books as statements

09:51.500 --> 09:56.966
beyond the fictional boundaries?

09:59.269 --> 10:07.378
I mean, I have no doubt that they are, but I wouldn't be the one to see them that way.

10:07.398 --> 10:19.212
I mean, the most I can do is write them, and then I hope people read them, and I'm very grateful if anyone thinks about them enough to

10:19.816 --> 10:49.452
say anything intelligent about them but I sort of limit myself to writing and to thinking about writing and really I don't mean to sound overly modest because I'm not a modest person at all but I couldn't do that I couldn't think of myself as having a body of work or as a person of

10:49.853 --> 10:52.258
you know, saying anything important.

10:52.318 --> 10:53.541
I hope to say something.

10:53.581 --> 10:55.024
I want to say something important.

10:55.044 --> 10:56.808
I want to say something interesting.

10:57.810 --> 11:00.296
But I'm not sure I do.

11:00.857 --> 11:05.788
I'm very grateful if it seems so to people and if it makes sense to people.

11:05.828 --> 11:07.211
I mean, it's my intention to.

11:07.852 --> 11:08.233
But I...

11:09.800 --> 11:11.562
I really couldn't defend my work.

11:11.763 --> 11:14.566
I think you are being too wise.

11:14.987 --> 11:21.515
But do you have a sense then of your reader, of who your audience is when you're writing?

11:21.556 --> 11:21.816
No.

11:22.317 --> 11:22.657
You don't?

11:23.058 --> 11:23.218
No.

11:23.658 --> 11:26.822
I know, I mean, it's a very interesting thing.

11:26.843 --> 11:33.251
I mean, I know some sort of basic rough things about my reader.

11:33.371 --> 11:35.554
I know that my reader is not

11:36.158 --> 11:38.801
are not the people I am from.

11:39.021 --> 11:50.673
They're not people from a small island with a history of colonialism, because the people where I'm from do not really read.

11:50.713 --> 11:53.396
It's not a literary place.

11:55.198 --> 11:56.299
It's not like Ireland.

11:56.459 --> 12:00.364
It's the people that I see.

12:00.644 --> 12:02.706
I live in a society

12:03.175 --> 12:09.242
where I'm read, but I do not write for or about those people.

12:09.282 --> 12:17.531
So I'm in a bit of a puzzle here, and I'm in a bit of a strange situation.

12:18.431 --> 12:31.866
But that's basically what I know about my readers, that they're not from a small island in the West Indies.

12:32.251 --> 12:46.150
To make it even more strange or more human, really, because ideally this is the way human existence ought to be, most of the people who read me do not even look like me.

12:46.790 --> 12:52.538
So it's... Well, I mean, is that... Do you think that... Are you suggesting that they're...

12:54.627 --> 12:59.012
white people or African-American people or both?

12:59.032 --> 13:03.477
I don't like to use those words because they're... But you brought it up, you said they don't look like me.

13:03.497 --> 13:05.039
No, I... I'm just following up on that.

13:05.079 --> 13:06.801
Yeah, but I didn't use those words.

13:07.021 --> 13:08.963
Oh, you didn't, that's why I asked the question.

13:08.983 --> 13:13.108
I only said they don't look like me in a certain way.

13:13.128 --> 13:16.732
They tend to be mostly women, but they're not women of my complexion.

13:16.752 --> 13:22.879
And I say this only because if I give a reading, for the most part, the people who show up

13:23.416 --> 13:25.939
hear me read are not black women.

13:25.959 --> 13:26.260
Really?

13:27.621 --> 13:27.861
Yeah.

13:28.002 --> 13:28.723
Does that surprise you?

13:29.123 --> 13:45.263
Um, no, because I just take all of those things as, um, naturally, uh, you know, I grew up reading, um, and loved to read, um, Charlotte Bronte.

13:45.463 --> 13:47.165
Well, Charlotte Bronte did not look like that.

13:47.205 --> 13:51.010
Completely identified with Jamie and, um,

13:51.445 --> 14:00.718
So why should anyone look like me be... Why should the people interested in my writing look like me?

14:01.079 --> 14:10.652
I take it for granted that people are more interested in their other than they are in themselves, because I know I am.

14:12.054 --> 14:21.267
Just by contrast, there's a piece in the New York Times a couple of days ago, this Terry McMillan book, which is now a film,

14:21.533 --> 14:31.043
And how it's almost a phenomenon of how African-American women are almost going in groups to see the movie and to discuss it.

14:31.143 --> 14:36.689
And if you talked about an audience, I would have to say it would be overwhelmingly female and black.

14:36.829 --> 14:38.250
Yes, yes.

14:39.371 --> 14:44.957
But of course, maybe there's a shared life experience there that she's talking about.

14:45.558 --> 14:45.958
Apparently.

14:46.018 --> 14:50.543
That is very common to particularly American, meaning the continental U.S.

14:50.563 --> 14:50.663
Yeah.

14:50.845 --> 14:56.892
But what you were writing about, of course, was not a shared experience.

14:56.912 --> 14:57.233
That's right.

14:57.493 --> 15:02.299
For the overwhelming majority of your readers, I would just say.

15:02.579 --> 15:10.469
That would be... I almost never identify with popular or anything.

15:10.529 --> 15:20.481
For instance, there was a movie called The Harder They Come, and it was about West Indians and

15:21.288 --> 15:25.814
and I didn't particularly identify with it.

15:25.935 --> 15:32.584
I almost wouldn't identify with something like that, but that's just me.

15:32.604 --> 15:47.145
I would identify, I seem to, and it's perverse, I admit, almost always would identify with something other than a representative of myself.

15:47.546 --> 15:49.168
I think I look for something

15:49.975 --> 15:51.296
much more peculiar.

15:51.977 --> 15:54.760
You're talking about now in terms of what you like to read.

15:54.880 --> 15:56.923
And what I like to see, yeah.

15:57.183 --> 15:59.585
Do you like movies?

15:59.966 --> 16:03.189
I do, too.

16:03.209 --> 16:07.554
I mean, I've got a young daughter who reads, but movies.

16:07.574 --> 16:08.575
Yes.

16:08.775 --> 16:09.736
It's a culture, I think.

16:09.756 --> 16:11.078
Yes, yes.

16:13.881 --> 16:19.527
Yeah, I get a little suspicious of... I would hate to have...

16:20.536 --> 16:24.883
a movie represent me, or to feel a movie represent me.

16:24.923 --> 16:31.193
That would be a little disturbing to me, but that's just me.

16:31.213 --> 16:32.795
When you say, representing me, you mean your work?

16:33.656 --> 16:34.658
No, no.

16:35.559 --> 16:36.922
Myself, yes.

16:36.982 --> 16:42.931
To look at a movie and say, boy, that's about me, let's all go see to having this shared experience.

16:43.732 --> 16:47.438
That wouldn't be me, but no.

16:47.890 --> 16:50.192
How about a film to represent your work?

16:50.953 --> 16:52.915
Have there been films made of any of you?

16:53.015 --> 16:56.318
No, and I'd be happy if someone did, because they'd pay me money, I think.

16:58.060 --> 16:58.480
I hope.

17:00.082 --> 17:03.225
I have no... No objections?

17:03.365 --> 17:03.946
Not at all.

17:03.986 --> 17:04.726
No reservations?

17:05.807 --> 17:17.779
No, I mean, I've written the... I've done what I mainly aim to do, which is to write a book, and anything else would be...

17:18.653 --> 17:19.234
Wonderful.

17:19.254 --> 17:21.415
Yes, kind of gravy.

17:21.876 --> 17:23.197
But it's not something I worry about.

17:23.217 --> 17:40.012
I mean, the book is a book in any case, and we understand that when it goes to those people, it's a whole new existence and another work that's suggested by what you've written, not necessarily yet.

17:40.032 --> 17:43.775
I'm trying to jump around like this.

17:43.795 --> 17:44.376
Oh, not at all.

17:44.476 --> 17:46.838
It's kind of fun.

17:48.404 --> 17:53.396
Some of your work, or maybe even a lot of it, has been characterized as being angry work.

17:53.416 --> 17:54.318
Do you agree with that?

17:54.618 --> 17:55.260
Oh, no.

17:55.961 --> 18:04.000
Of course, I'm reading some of these things in the feminist companion to literature, where they have these little...

18:04.233 --> 18:04.834
Oh, really?

18:05.054 --> 18:08.179
You probably know more about me than I know about myself.

18:08.199 --> 18:09.401
Well, I try.

18:09.421 --> 18:12.285
I do have a wonderful reference library, I have to say.

18:12.385 --> 18:13.327
Oh, that's wonderful.

18:13.347 --> 18:15.090
I've never seen The Feminist Companion.

18:15.170 --> 18:16.131
Am I in The Feminist Companion?

18:16.151 --> 18:25.525
You are, and you're also in this brand-new Oxford Companion to women, specifically women writers.

18:25.545 --> 18:25.966
I am?

18:26.307 --> 18:28.570
And it's quite a substantial...

18:29.461 --> 18:31.723
Maybe I'll Xerox it and send you a copy of that.

18:31.743 --> 18:33.645
No, I think I'll go and get it right now.

18:33.665 --> 18:35.126
It's a new book.

18:35.146 --> 18:36.628
It's an Oxford book.

18:36.648 --> 18:37.469
Amazing.

18:37.489 --> 18:51.642
But I did read in a good chunk of it in a small place, which is in an anthology, which is certainly, I think, you have to agree as an angry... Strangely, I don't agree.

18:52.423 --> 18:53.644
Oh, good.

18:53.744 --> 18:54.084
Okay.

18:54.845 --> 18:55.906
That it's angry.

18:56.126 --> 18:57.848
I think it's true.

18:58.553 --> 19:08.508
And I don't understand why a true expression, the truth about something, would be anger.

19:08.548 --> 19:12.013
It's not the expression that's angry.

19:12.293 --> 19:13.996
It's the thing that's not.

19:14.096 --> 19:17.982
Well, I mean, for instance, there's a quote, people like me cannot forgive and cannot forget.

19:18.823 --> 19:21.707
Is that an expression of anger, or is it a statement of fact?

19:22.008 --> 19:22.949
Yes, a fact.

19:23.670 --> 19:27.075
It only seems angry

19:27.697 --> 19:35.187
to someone who is not like me, and who might be afraid that such a statement is directed at them.

19:35.567 --> 19:42.616
But I don't think it's angry at all, in any case, even if it was angry.

19:42.656 --> 19:43.377
That's fine, too.

19:43.397 --> 19:51.127
I mean, if you have a reason to be angry, I mean, it's a normal human emotion that responds to a situation.

19:51.327 --> 19:53.670
Well, except, yes, except...

19:54.595 --> 20:19.299
People use that to say that the thoughts I expressed in that book were unacceptable because they were angry, as if one could tell such a story in the form of what rhyming couplets or a jingle, how else could one say?

20:19.359 --> 20:23.303
I think also the other thing is that

20:24.228 --> 20:34.685
It always seems strange to me that no one ever really says a man who writes about anything is angry.

20:37.209 --> 20:45.482
I don't remember, for instance, Soul on Ice being described as angry, or any book.

20:45.582 --> 20:46.364
Really?

20:46.464 --> 20:51.552
No, I've never heard Soul on Ice being described as angry.

20:52.190 --> 21:05.611
It's been described as all sorts of things, but anger, if a woman expresses something, I think, on the whole, strongly, and it seems angry, then it's a condemnation.

21:07.153 --> 21:19.752
It seems peculiarly wrong that a woman... Are you suggesting that there's still a form of prejudice that's applied to women who... I'm not suggesting, I'm stating clearly that I believe that.

21:20.273 --> 21:20.914
And...

21:22.008 --> 21:24.372
You know, I think that's a very valid point.

21:24.392 --> 21:28.538
I mean, because in these descriptions that I've read, the word anger, I've got written right here.

21:28.618 --> 21:29.299
It comes up again.

21:29.319 --> 21:30.000
It comes up again.

21:30.020 --> 21:33.605
Well, I promise you to read reviews of Solon, I see what you do that.

21:33.706 --> 21:35.929
That's really interesting.

21:35.949 --> 21:44.482
And in one of the descriptions called it, I'm trying to find it, I wrote it down, polemical.

21:44.502 --> 21:46.745
I mean, polemic.

21:46.765 --> 21:48.308
But how would you respond to that?

21:48.328 --> 21:48.989
It's strange.

21:49.049 --> 21:50.631
You took it very...

21:50.847 --> 22:16.840
I remember particularly someone in the New York Times just being so offended, must have been a young person, being very offended that this was written in the Sunday Times, as if I was robbing her of her little treat of two weeks or a weekend in January on a day like today.

22:16.860 --> 22:18.382
Well, maybe she wrote it on a day like today.

22:18.402 --> 22:19.183
I can see how.

22:19.535 --> 22:23.182
one would object to not being able to go to a nice warm place on a day like today.

22:25.145 --> 22:37.307
But then I thought, well, there, the book will just die the life of a book when it's not reviewed well.

22:38.080 --> 22:40.743
But sure enough, it just goes on and on.

22:41.705 --> 22:43.827
You mean that kind of reaction?

22:43.988 --> 22:46.491
No, no, a positive reaction.

22:46.871 --> 22:49.935
The book is not only still in print, it's taught all the time.

22:49.975 --> 22:51.658
Now, which book is this?

22:51.718 --> 22:52.439
A small play.

22:52.639 --> 22:56.864
It's sold hundreds of thousands of copies.

22:56.944 --> 22:57.385
Wonderful.

22:57.745 --> 23:01.310
Yeah, I feel quite... Because it's just found an audience.

23:01.390 --> 23:06.737
It finds new people who read it and say, you know, this is

23:06.903 --> 23:13.549
It's just so true, and I'm... It's never stopped anyone from going on a holiday.

23:13.589 --> 23:14.430
That wasn't the point.

23:14.510 --> 23:20.415
The point was to make, as all of any writer does, is to make people think.

23:20.815 --> 23:27.941
And we should point out that that's a non-fictional work as opposed to another work, which is largely fiction.

23:27.961 --> 23:28.742
Friction, yeah.

23:29.022 --> 23:30.384
But it found an audience.

23:31.004 --> 23:35.408
Well, I should think it would be read in departments like this.

23:36.046 --> 23:40.431
Like this, it's read in high schools.

23:40.451 --> 23:43.134
It's read in travel literature.

23:43.154 --> 23:50.342
It's read in all kinds of... I drive my daughter to school when I come to Boston and Cambridge today.

23:50.362 --> 23:54.307
So she's in the eighth grade.

23:54.327 --> 23:57.791
And she'll always ask me, well, what book are we doing today?

23:57.871 --> 23:59.813
And I didn't tell you this.

23:59.833 --> 24:00.914
And I said, she said, I like it a lot.

24:00.934 --> 24:02.916
And I said, have you read any of Ms.

24:02.936 --> 24:03.437
Kincaid's books?

24:03.822 --> 24:06.186
She said, next year, which is ninth grade.

24:06.206 --> 24:06.726
Yes.

24:07.227 --> 24:10.853
And that must be very interesting, wouldn't you think?

24:11.273 --> 24:22.971
Very gratifying for you that, you know, not just in specific-focused departments such as Afro-American departments here at Harvard.

24:22.991 --> 24:23.231
Oh, no.

24:23.251 --> 24:25.815
But in the ninth grade of Fay School, all over the world.

24:25.995 --> 24:26.837
Oh, yes.

24:26.997 --> 24:29.661
It's read in... I just got a...

24:30.012 --> 24:43.105
A letter from someone I know in Colorado whose daughter is in the... Yeah, it's part of her reading list for high school.

24:43.586 --> 24:49.712
By the time she graduates, she has to have read... Among the books she has to have read is Annie John.

24:50.813 --> 24:55.598
So, yeah, it is widely read for...

24:56.928 --> 25:06.256
I think mostly because there are very few books about young women, the experience of a young woman growing up.

25:06.477 --> 25:09.259
I think that's probably what it is.

25:09.379 --> 25:16.065
It's not, because, you know, it's not, if you remember, I mean, if you read it, it doesn't mention race at all.

25:16.085 --> 25:17.647
It doesn't actually.

25:18.007 --> 25:20.830
Well, it certainly suggests class, however.

25:21.150 --> 25:26.935
It suggests all sorts of conflict, but, you see, I think race is a false idea, so I don't really deal with it.

25:27.370 --> 25:29.152
Could you expand on that?

25:29.592 --> 25:37.619
I think it's a shorthand way of saying something very violent, which is, I have power over you.

25:38.000 --> 25:46.888
And the person who defines race is usually the person who can enforce something about it, who can make it work for them.

25:47.729 --> 25:54.795
But the person who has no interest in race,

25:54.944 --> 26:01.853
who's not interested in power doesn't come up with this construct.

26:01.873 --> 26:06.179
It's just an invention to enforce your power.

26:06.339 --> 26:08.562
And so I never talk about race.

26:08.642 --> 26:11.325
I talk about the inflammatory thing, which is power.

26:12.107 --> 26:22.420
Well, when you write about the country club on the island, for instance, where colonial British people have

26:22.737 --> 26:35.911
eaten and played golf for three years, Europeans, and where people from the island cannot go, or they can remember the first time, anything.

26:36.792 --> 26:39.235
Are we not talking about race here?

26:39.255 --> 26:47.724
No, we're talking about power, what powerful group does what to the powerless group.

26:48.145 --> 26:51.208
I think that when you start to talk about race,

26:52.201 --> 27:05.861
You remove your, you become sort of obsessed with ethnic identities, which is what the racial definition wants you to do in the first place.

27:05.881 --> 27:18.900
And you become protective of your group and disrespectful of that group and begin to see people only in terms of group, not whether they're doing something good or whether they're doing something bad.

27:19.505 --> 27:27.575
And groups of people can do do bad things, and groups of people do do good things, but individuals also do good things, and individuals do bad things.

27:28.516 --> 27:41.472
But the minute you start lumping people together, you fall into all sorts of, you're likely to fall into all sorts of moral abyss.

27:42.433 --> 27:46.558
And also you can't solve, the problem is power.

27:47.180 --> 27:49.142
always people are talking about power.

27:49.182 --> 27:54.647
People are acting out of desire for power.

27:55.328 --> 28:01.054
It's very easy to do what you want to do if you just organize people in groups.

28:01.074 --> 28:03.857
That's the black group, that's the white group.

28:03.877 --> 28:15.128
Then you just get to lop off their heads if you can, all of them, without thinking about human ramifications.

28:15.513 --> 28:16.714
I don't believe in race.

28:16.895 --> 28:24.484
I believe in that people do good things and people do bad things, and people are powerful and people are powerless.

28:24.544 --> 28:29.330
You've lived in the United States, I think, for close to 30 years, probably.

28:29.350 --> 28:30.751
You moved here in 57?

28:30.811 --> 28:31.092
Yes.

28:31.913 --> 28:42.145
And so you've been here certainly long enough to be a part of the, to have formed opinions of

28:42.614 --> 28:46.138
or I hate to use the word opinions, but perceptions.

28:46.158 --> 28:47.039
Yes.

28:47.540 --> 28:58.913
How do you, and I hate to jump from your work to a perception of what's going on in this country now when we talk about, we don't use the word race, but look at the racial revisions that seem to have.

28:58.933 --> 29:00.475
Oh, they only confirm.

29:01.516 --> 29:03.258
Maybe they've just popped up to the floor.

29:03.298 --> 29:07.023
They only confirm my point of view.

29:08.204 --> 29:10.647
These

29:11.386 --> 29:20.215
ideas that people think of themselves and each other as groups and not as what a person is.

29:20.895 --> 29:33.027
And it's particularly weird in this society when different groups of people are so fluidly connected.

29:35.429 --> 29:40.414
You know, it's true you have neighborhoods of this and neighborhoods of that, but people generally

29:40.816 --> 29:45.221
quite go back and forth with each other, more so than in most places.

29:48.685 --> 30:07.347
No, I just simply, living here, the longer I live here, confirm for me that this, you know, I mean, when you sort of, you want to see how absurd it becomes, if you, then you begin to look at something like the census in which people are asking for

30:07.748 --> 30:11.833
another classification other than... This morning on the radio is coming in.

30:11.853 --> 30:12.294
Oh, was it?

30:12.334 --> 30:12.754
I didn't.

30:12.774 --> 30:14.917
Yeah, on the radio this morning, on the news.

30:14.977 --> 30:18.662
People who are not half black, half white, they don't want to be.

30:18.702 --> 30:31.479
They want a category that says multiracial, as opposed to... And the liberals don't want it, and the conservatives don't want it, and for reasons that make sense.

30:31.879 --> 30:32.820
But it's ridiculous, isn't it?

30:32.860 --> 30:34.262
It is ridiculous.

30:34.282 --> 30:36.405
It is completely ridiculous.

30:36.858 --> 30:48.631
And that's, again, you know, a group of people sort of trying to carve out a place for themselves.

30:49.592 --> 30:50.613
Everybody has a group.

30:50.693 --> 30:51.434
Why not them?

30:52.535 --> 30:56.179
You know, I did an interview just about a year ago on Martha's Vineyard with Dorothy West.

30:57.200 --> 31:00.584
And I should also be pleased to send you a copy of it.

31:00.604 --> 31:01.585
I'd love to.

31:01.605 --> 31:05.329
Because it's been in 40 newspapers so far, and I've placed it everywhere.

31:06.457 --> 31:11.142
what a wonderful, wonderful woman she is.

31:11.162 --> 31:14.266
And I think she's spoken here at Harvard before.

31:15.107 --> 31:19.732
But, of course, one of the themes that she writes about is people passing for her.

31:19.832 --> 31:22.976
Blue eyes, her father had blue eyes.

31:22.996 --> 31:27.781
And she said, you know, it's very easy to pass for her.

31:27.801 --> 31:35.350
And, of course, if there's this perception of you of being white and not black, then maybe you can, it's very easy to transcend this

31:35.903 --> 31:42.013
this power group picture, this classical picture that you see.

31:42.193 --> 31:42.694
Yes.

31:42.734 --> 31:51.609
But she's writing, of course, as a seven-year-old who lived through the Harlem Renaissance and really experienced things.

31:51.909 --> 31:53.031
There's a wonderful book.

31:53.051 --> 32:00.443
I think I've lent it to some student of mine by a woman named Jessie Fawcett called Plumban, in which...

32:01.165 --> 32:09.095
It's about that, a girl, two girls, two sisters, one's very black and one's very light, and they pass.

32:09.236 --> 32:12.460
The one passes, but they have to deny each other's presence.

32:12.480 --> 32:14.983
But see, that's a word even that's in the language.

32:15.023 --> 32:15.364
Pass.

32:15.384 --> 32:16.525
Oh, yes, it is.

32:16.545 --> 32:16.645
Pass.

32:16.665 --> 32:19.649
And it has a resonance, doesn't it?

32:19.669 --> 32:19.849
It does.

32:19.869 --> 32:20.270
Passing.

32:20.350 --> 32:20.811
Yeah.

32:20.991 --> 32:26.498
It's an American... It doesn't happen where I'm from.

32:26.984 --> 32:30.929
Where I'm from, it's so small, everybody would know everything about you.

32:30.949 --> 32:32.772
You live to pass for very long.

32:34.834 --> 32:37.798
But anyway, I don't believe in it.

32:40.041 --> 32:43.886
And it causes all sorts of strange things.

32:44.527 --> 32:47.811
I never describe people as white or black.

32:47.831 --> 32:48.812
I'll describe someone.

32:48.832 --> 32:50.354
I'm not used to it, really.

32:54.220 --> 32:56.923
But I live in a place in which people are often described.

32:57.173 --> 32:59.235
In our family, we never describe people by race.

32:59.295 --> 33:18.235
But when I try to describe someone to someone who, mostly an American person, if I never mention the color of the person, they assume it's a white person.

33:18.255 --> 33:23.721
Yes, they assume that you only describe someone's

33:23.954 --> 33:30.624
color if they're black, but if they're not, you feel that they're normal, that you don't need to.

33:30.644 --> 33:33.588
Well, I would hate to use that word, normal.

33:35.251 --> 33:40.318
Well, it's really quite true, but I don't know how to say someone is black, because I don't say I am black.

33:40.338 --> 33:48.510
Well, you know, I have found, if you're talking like, for instance, something about my wife's doctor, who's a doctor who delivered children,

33:49.604 --> 33:51.728
The assumption is that this doctor is a man.

33:51.748 --> 33:51.888
Yes.

33:51.908 --> 33:52.569
And guess what?

33:52.769 --> 33:53.631
It's a woman.

33:54.032 --> 33:54.432
A woman.

33:54.613 --> 33:54.813
Yes.

33:55.274 --> 34:05.471
Or I wrote in a book that I recently had published about that I wanted to maintain the anonymity of this particular person, the reasons that made sense to her.

34:05.491 --> 34:13.705
I represented her at an auction in New York, so I wrote it in such a way that you didn't know whether...

34:13.921 --> 34:20.849
this person was a man or a woman, because I figure if I say she, well, that eliminates the possibilities by 50%.

34:20.869 --> 34:21.210
Yes.

34:22.010 --> 34:31.642
So everybody assumed I was writing about a man, because only men have this kind of money to go to Sotheby's in New York and bid $250,000 on artworks or whatever.

34:31.662 --> 34:31.822
Amazing.

34:31.842 --> 34:36.808
And so everybody thinks I'm writing about a man when I'm writing about a woman.

34:36.828 --> 34:39.171
But I think it's the same thing that you're talking about.

34:39.231 --> 34:41.674
We have these perceptions.

34:41.694 --> 34:42.915
Yes.

34:43.182 --> 34:44.864
mindsets about people.

34:45.625 --> 34:52.113
If they're accomplished and powerful, well, then they must be white or male, I guess.

34:52.133 --> 35:04.648
Do you see yourself writing in any kind of a tradition, then, if you don't see your work as a body of work, as a corpus, but do you see yourself emerging out of any kind of a literary tradition?

35:04.808 --> 35:05.589
Well, yes.

35:07.752 --> 35:09.474
Yes, and it's an English tradition.

35:09.554 --> 35:10.535
It's not American.

35:11.977 --> 35:12.177
Yes.

35:12.595 --> 35:20.546
Yes, I have an English cultural influence.

35:20.927 --> 35:35.186
You know, I grew up on the British colonial rule, and that was my education, and that's my frame of literary reference.

35:35.367 --> 35:42.096
I have one question.

35:42.548 --> 35:56.124
Of course, you write a lot about the English colonial influence with, and some people might say anger, again, to go back to that word earlier, but it's not anger so much, in your view, as it is.

35:57.466 --> 35:58.427
This is the way it is.

35:58.447 --> 35:58.587
Yes.

35:58.607 --> 35:59.468
And this is what happened.

35:59.548 --> 35:59.708
Yes.

36:00.669 --> 36:00.770
Yeah.

36:00.790 --> 36:01.851
And you would not describe it.

36:01.871 --> 36:05.495
I mean, you talked about the visit to England, for instance.

36:05.515 --> 36:05.655
Mm-hmm.

36:05.695 --> 36:09.079
Show them the tie with the Prince of Wales.

36:09.099 --> 36:10.581
Oh, yeah.

36:10.721 --> 36:12.083
Poor Prince of Wales.

36:12.603 --> 36:16.027
Yes, her... Self-image of... Right, her culture, yes.

36:16.727 --> 36:18.189
Well, sadly, sorry.

36:19.931 --> 36:20.131
Yeah.

36:23.014 --> 36:40.652
Yeah, I was... Well, of course, you know, they just hadn't expected that, you know, people like me would have the same critical view of them that they had had of us.

36:40.919 --> 36:44.224
It's like you weren't allowed to have them.

36:44.625 --> 36:45.005
Oh, no, no, no.

36:45.025 --> 36:48.531
They were perfect.

36:48.671 --> 36:56.383
As a girl, did you sense that you had these creative writings?

36:56.403 --> 36:57.304
I think so.

36:57.364 --> 37:01.230
I was very depressed when I was young.

37:01.250 --> 37:06.859
I think so, and I really couldn't do anything.

37:08.611 --> 37:12.136
that one was supposed to do as a young woman.

37:12.777 --> 37:22.912
So I think it must have been, I must have wanted to be what I am, but didn't know how it would be.

37:22.932 --> 37:25.997
So I think it was, I must have.

37:26.017 --> 37:27.679
I didn't know anyone who was an artist.

37:27.760 --> 37:30.524
I didn't know anyone who wrote.

37:30.544 --> 37:38.095
But there must be lots of people like me all over the globe, really,

37:38.598 --> 37:42.263
want to do something, but have no voice.

37:42.283 --> 37:50.716
Of course, you discovered this when you came to the United States, and you were, I guess, 18 or so when you came here.

37:50.736 --> 37:58.767
And I think it was amazing how quickly, I mean, you were a very young woman when your first pieces began to be published.

37:58.827 --> 38:00.249
How old was I?

38:00.350 --> 38:03.835
I thought it would have been 25.

38:06.118 --> 38:08.301
I suppose, of course, I felt so old.

38:08.534 --> 38:16.122
I felt very old, yeah.

38:16.142 --> 38:27.074
And speaking of the cold weather and where you're from, the warm weather, how in the world did you choose to move up to Vermont?

38:27.394 --> 38:30.057
Oh, and everybody asks that.

38:30.397 --> 38:38.406
But I love the contrast, and I sort of think of it as something worth enduring.

38:39.382 --> 38:43.108
because what follows is so beautiful to me.

38:43.829 --> 38:44.811
I love spring.

38:44.831 --> 38:46.593
I love summer.

38:46.614 --> 38:48.917
I've begun to really love fall.

38:49.198 --> 38:51.041
I think I shall never love winter.

38:52.202 --> 38:55.187
Well, it's pretty, though.

38:55.207 --> 39:04.762
It loses its... Yeah, it's pretty, you know, but I think that you have to force the prettiness too much.

39:04.782 --> 39:07.026
You say it's pretty, but...

39:07.782 --> 39:11.829
There's something about it that pretty as it is.

39:12.891 --> 39:18.360
There are things that are pretty that you want forever, and I don't think winter is one of them.

39:18.380 --> 39:20.383
We're really quite pleased, aren't we, to see it?

39:21.425 --> 39:21.866
Yes.

39:21.886 --> 39:23.749
To see those first robins arrive.

39:23.829 --> 39:24.591
Oh, absolutely.

39:24.811 --> 39:28.337
And you think it's pretty, and it's really more of a consolation.

39:28.437 --> 39:30.020
Well, at least it's pretty.

39:30.040 --> 39:31.903
Than the forsythias.

39:31.923 --> 39:32.524
Yes.

39:32.673 --> 39:34.316
Oh, whatever.

39:34.376 --> 39:35.257
That is wonderful.

39:35.277 --> 39:36.840
The robins are wonderful.

39:36.860 --> 39:38.101
The bulk is coming up.

39:38.122 --> 39:39.163
The crocus is popping up.

39:39.183 --> 39:40.285
Yes, yes.

39:40.305 --> 39:41.847
And it really is a sense of renewal.

39:41.907 --> 39:45.793
I mean, you want to go beyond the seasonal thing.

39:45.834 --> 39:46.935
The symbolism of it is.

39:47.015 --> 39:47.717
It's profound.

39:47.737 --> 39:48.718
It's quite profound.

39:48.999 --> 39:53.245
It really is a low time, a moribund time, if anything.

39:53.265 --> 39:55.469
I could never live in the one climate again.

39:55.889 --> 39:56.150
Really?

39:56.190 --> 39:57.211
Yeah.

39:57.231 --> 39:58.754
Well, that's interesting, isn't it?

39:59.475 --> 39:59.575
Yeah.

40:00.888 --> 40:02.470
because we all love the warm weather.

40:02.750 --> 40:11.039
On the same radio broadcast I was listening to on the way in, they called somebody in Hawaii, where it was 80 degrees, you know, during the day and 70 at night.

40:13.121 --> 40:21.470
But if only you could just have, you know, maybe just two weeks of it during the season.

40:21.490 --> 40:26.616
If this was just some massive exchange, that would be nice.

40:26.696 --> 40:30.220
But this is, yeah,

40:30.487 --> 40:35.192
A mild winter, but apparently we might soon be having only mild winters.

40:35.212 --> 40:38.195
Yeah, I don't... You don't think, you don't see it.

40:38.215 --> 40:40.837
I haven't, I knew we would have a tough winter to see.

40:40.857 --> 40:41.157
Yes.

40:41.177 --> 40:47.083
I mean, they're talking a half a degree over the last, I don't think, in our lifetime.

40:47.103 --> 40:58.114
I mean, I guess that's a lot in global terms, but... A farmer, I know, said it was going to be a very

40:59.242 --> 41:04.208
snowy winter, even more so than the one before last.

41:04.448 --> 41:17.063
And his indicator was that the trees had formed so many leaves because the earth needed to protect itself.

41:17.083 --> 41:19.766
I thought that was a bit kind of odd.

41:19.907 --> 41:20.487
I don't get that.

41:20.507 --> 41:22.009
I don't see where that has anything to do with climate.

41:22.343 --> 41:26.249
Well, I mean, you know how farmers are.

41:26.369 --> 41:30.115
They think that, you know, but it seemed a bit too telepathic to me.

41:30.215 --> 41:33.140
I didn't know nature could be so radioing.

41:33.160 --> 41:35.403
It really telegraph its punches, too.

41:35.423 --> 41:48.663
Yes, I know, tele-radioing the tree, saying, oh, more leaves, oh, more leaves, because it's going to be... Let's just talk a little bit, just come back to the book with his hand, and then I'll take my leaves.

41:48.684 --> 41:50.967
I have an hour, and I'm going to extend my welcome.

41:52.111 --> 41:58.117
Tell me, did you have the title for this book when you started it?

41:58.157 --> 42:15.152
Because, you know, one of the recurring phrases that is a very powerful, repetitive phrase is, my mother died at the moment I was born, which obviously has to be the most central phrase I would suggest in the whole book.

42:15.172 --> 42:17.975
And did you start with this conceptually?

42:19.716 --> 42:21.578
Yes, I knew she was.

42:22.047 --> 42:23.629
motherless.

42:23.829 --> 42:27.573
I knew she was loveless.

42:27.593 --> 42:32.419
And then on the other hand, she would be barren to her own doing.

42:32.439 --> 42:49.759
Yes, she controls her life that way, that people don't like women to have, because I don't know why, men kill people all the time, actual people all the time, without

42:50.482 --> 42:55.489
thinking about it and without being condemned for it.

42:55.509 --> 43:02.139
In fact, they award each other medals for these incredible acts of murder.

43:02.980 --> 43:14.737
But for a woman to make the tiniest gesture to give her life some shape that she might, that might be a comfort to her, the shape of her life, is condemned.

43:17.401 --> 43:20.185
So I liked her having that sort of

43:22.612 --> 43:27.217
you know, small, hollow victory over herself.

43:27.357 --> 43:28.639
I knew that from the beginning.

43:28.659 --> 43:40.412
I didn't necessarily read that as a victory, though, because she kind of gave it, she certainly thought about it later on in life, didn't she, about that decision, or maybe not?

43:40.432 --> 43:42.074
She doesn't regret it.

43:42.094 --> 43:44.757
It's a fait accompli?

43:44.777 --> 43:48.501
Yes, it's not, well, it is a small, it is a victory, because it's,

43:48.751 --> 43:52.016
something she wanted and accomplished.

43:52.036 --> 43:53.699
And that she controlled as well.

43:53.919 --> 43:55.802
Yes, it's a victory.

43:55.822 --> 43:59.969
You may say all sorts of things about what kind of victory it is.

43:59.989 --> 44:01.812
Well, and I'm not going to judge her either on that.

44:01.832 --> 44:03.575
Well, no one can.

44:05.317 --> 44:09.544
But it is, yeah, a victory.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.022
It's her decision.

44:15.123 --> 44:17.005
Yes, that's right.

44:17.846 --> 44:21.810
Why that should be a big deal is a bafflement to me.

44:22.551 --> 44:26.136
But this concept of my mother died at the moment I was born.

44:26.156 --> 44:27.057
Yes.

44:27.497 --> 44:29.219
And why is it repeated to me?

44:29.259 --> 44:37.489
Well, because it's a central event to which any love

44:39.005 --> 44:46.635
she felt she would have had in the world revolves around this central figure that was absent.

44:47.897 --> 45:00.072
And it's the loss of love, or the entire absence of how to love.

45:00.092 --> 45:08.303
I mean, there's a part in it, I think, where she says what makes a person being observed by loving eyes, being

45:08.772 --> 45:12.857
She never had that, so that is repeated over and over.

45:13.297 --> 45:19.124
Her mother dies, and she, as a mother, dies every time.

45:19.144 --> 45:33.581
She doesn't allow her children to be born, and the mother they would be, or the progenitors they would be, dies also.

45:33.601 --> 45:36.585
Do you consider this an ironic title in that

45:37.021 --> 45:41.386
She knows nothing about her mother other than the fact that she died at the moment of her own birth.

45:41.406 --> 45:41.606
No.

45:41.686 --> 45:43.968
I'm not capable of irony, I don't think.

45:45.050 --> 45:46.791
No, it's not ironic.

45:46.811 --> 45:52.237
It's meant straight.

45:54.780 --> 46:06.893
It's the life of her mother in her and the mother she's not also.

46:07.362 --> 46:10.946
But when we talk of the word autobiography, it is the telling of a life.

46:11.747 --> 46:12.607
No, it's the telling of a life.

46:12.627 --> 46:16.371
And all she knows about this life is what she expresses in one sentence.

46:17.192 --> 46:25.521
But she knows about her own life, and she is a mother who is not allowed, who has not allowed herself to be.

46:26.342 --> 46:29.005
But also, I don't want to more.

46:29.065 --> 46:29.885
I'm just having fun.

46:29.905 --> 46:30.766
Oh, no, no.

46:31.487 --> 46:32.889
I know I was going to be asked.

46:32.949 --> 46:34.130
Everybody sort of.

46:34.150 --> 46:36.653
Because it really is her own autobiography.

46:36.813 --> 46:37.133
Yes.

46:38.210 --> 46:41.375
And, yeah, she's a loveless mother.

46:42.256 --> 46:50.889
I mean, she tells the story of her life, literally from, if not from conception, but from delivery to the present.

46:50.909 --> 46:52.572
I mean, she does span 70 years.

46:52.632 --> 46:55.536
Yeah, and she does conceive children.

46:56.017 --> 46:56.538
That's right.

46:56.558 --> 46:58.941
It makes her motherly, but not a mother.

46:59.923 --> 47:00.063
Uh-huh.

47:00.083 --> 47:00.924
So, yeah, it's correct.

47:00.944 --> 47:01.625
It's correct.

47:01.805 --> 47:03.628
The title is correct.

47:03.648 --> 47:04.950
It's not ironic.

47:04.970 --> 47:06.192
Okay.

47:07.302 --> 47:08.263
I think it's wonderful.

47:10.566 --> 47:13.549
Have I missed anything that we should talk about?

47:13.569 --> 47:14.390
I don't think so.

47:16.192 --> 47:20.437
I'm going to shut this up.

47:20.477 --> 47:22.019
Would you inscribe this book for me?

47:22.219 --> 47:23.140
It would really be great.

47:23.360 --> 47:25.563
Just tell me briefly how long have you been here at Harvard?

47:25.623 --> 47:33.732
Oh, this is the third fall semester I've been here.

47:34.876 --> 47:47.095
I teach a course in creative writing and a literature course, various books I put together in some sort of theme, things I've read.

47:47.596 --> 47:48.457
I really enjoy it.

47:48.817 --> 47:50.540
I have wonderful students.

47:51.782 --> 47:55.468
So you've been here for three years or so, and you do teach literature.

47:55.808 --> 47:57.070
Yes, yes.

47:57.522 --> 47:59.744
Oh, no, no, no.

47:59.784 --> 48:00.645
I'm not a scholar.

48:03.408 --> 48:06.832
We talk about reading, ideas in reading.

48:07.032 --> 48:21.188
Actually, we've been reading lots of travel journals of explorers and plant hunters and how people name things, how people possess things.

48:21.208 --> 48:22.329
We try to talk about names.

48:22.429 --> 48:26.213
I'm interested in naming, because naming is a way of claiming something.

48:26.598 --> 48:33.470
The person who names the things takes something specific about it, determines all sorts of things about it.

48:33.490 --> 48:37.436
Well, that does apply, then, to your characters, doesn't it?

48:37.456 --> 48:38.057
Yes, I suppose so.

48:38.077 --> 48:39.359
To go back to the way we open.

48:39.379 --> 48:41.062
Yes, exactly.

48:41.543 --> 48:44.168
I think I have plenty of material.

48:44.188 --> 48:49.136
Just, also, the choice of the name Jamaica Kincaid.

48:49.316 --> 48:50.017
Oh, no.

48:50.037 --> 48:51.019
Forget about it.

48:51.168 --> 48:52.431
Has that been written about it?

48:52.451 --> 48:53.433
I've talked about it so much, yes.

48:53.453 --> 48:54.034
I'll find it then.

48:54.054 --> 48:55.437
I'm just curious.

48:55.457 --> 48:57.963
If only I'd known, I'd be asked this question.

48:57.983 --> 49:02.733
I was trying to not make my parents know I was writing.

49:02.933 --> 49:05.599
I changed my name, but they knew immediately.
