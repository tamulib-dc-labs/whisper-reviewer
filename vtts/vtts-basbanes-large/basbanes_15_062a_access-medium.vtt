WEBVTT

00:02.258 --> 00:05.141
Okay, I'm going to start, and we're on.

00:05.161 --> 00:06.162
Mr. Tom Wolfe.

00:08.164 --> 00:12.148
I guess the first thing is that reading this book, it could have been written within the last two weeks.

00:12.388 --> 00:15.351
That was dumb luck.

00:16.232 --> 00:26.983
Although I swear that I have thought many times about how similar this whole period is to what I've read about the Twins, particularly the old version.

00:55.297 --> 00:59.209
to get there because it's a crash.

00:59.229 --> 01:02.539
That's what it is with the highest behavior category.

01:02.560 --> 01:03.703
It's grand in one

01:50.866 --> 01:57.976
four days in the night.

01:57.996 --> 02:08.109
And then he said, of course, you've got to know when to get out, too.

02:08.309 --> 02:14.297
So, I mean, as long as it's going up from that on Friday, you know, that's enough to keep everybody going bad.

02:14.317 --> 02:15.439
But I don't know if anything is really different.

02:15.459 --> 02:16.881
It's like a gigantic, even like a gigantic chain there.

02:16.901 --> 02:19.344
That's the feeling out there when I was doing research in this book.

02:19.364 --> 02:19.945
When I was down there,

03:28.572 --> 03:33.452
And maybe that's what happened on the .

03:33.593 --> 03:39.055
Was the Center of Education for you in terms of Wall Street ?

04:13.443 --> 04:16.635
for a while time it was.

04:47.750 --> 04:56.219
We're the masters of the universe.

04:56.239 --> 04:58.241
Take a look.

04:58.301 --> 05:04.628
Take a look at what we're doing.

05:04.648 --> 05:07.751
And the optimism was just almost infectious.

05:07.771 --> 05:11.735
It made it feel like you were making money before you were paying no sense.

05:11.755 --> 05:13.657
So, I found it was really rather zero-rating, as a journalist, to see all of this self-self.

05:13.677 --> 05:16.440
And it was as strange to me as the South Park, South America.

05:17.534 --> 05:24.655
I'm interested also in getting to the actual weight of the normal life.

05:24.675 --> 05:29.670
I mean, certainly there were enormous risks to it.

05:58.287 --> 06:11.618
But for a start, it would be enough of it just to write a novel, having never written one.

06:11.638 --> 06:13.260
And that must be my career.

06:14.741 --> 06:28.092
But the other thing was that I had spattered off so much about how superior nonfiction was to the novel, and how untalented, or not too much that as I'm too.

06:28.730 --> 06:32.655
contemporary novelists were.

06:32.775 --> 06:36.981
And that really hasn't been the problem.

06:37.001 --> 06:40.906
But I think you're also saying it was relevant, too.

06:41.046 --> 06:53.342
There's a lot of talent out there, but it seems to me that people with the greatest natural talent of writers were churning away from religious material rather on these private novels.

06:53.362 --> 06:55.665
Virginia Woolf had a phrase about the novel of today.

07:03.948 --> 07:09.578
for the last 25 years.

07:09.638 --> 07:23.582
And I would say that they were all wrong, and that they're looking at society on a large scale rather than private law.

07:23.602 --> 07:25.365
But that's another way to ask a president to go around saying things like that.

07:47.333 --> 07:59.151
kind of click and say, wait a minute, I'm going a long way, and maybe disinculating properly as a serialization, and I'm just wondering about the process here.

07:59.332 --> 08:05.802
In the original version, John McCoy was a guest, and you're right, right?

08:05.822 --> 08:09.187
And I thought I was doing myself in favor by making money as a writer, because, oh, I'm doing research.

08:09.207 --> 08:12.953
I know what writers do and how they feel and react.

08:13.743 --> 08:19.814
And it didn't work because they hadn't really analyzed.

08:19.834 --> 08:20.495
I hadn't done work.

08:20.515 --> 08:23.660
The same kind of reporting that I should have done about the writers.

08:23.680 --> 08:25.584
I thought I had a very empowering character.

08:25.604 --> 08:27.707
Also, he never worked.

08:27.728 --> 08:29.170
But then all of the big technical problems,

08:58.867 --> 09:01.892
I decided to win.

09:01.912 --> 09:10.387
It ruined by a scandal, even ruined by a child, a scandal.

09:11.649 --> 09:16.538
But if you're buying millions of dollars from $100,000 or somebody who can't believe you, you can't believe you, you can't believe you, you can't believe you, you can't believe you.

09:31.402 --> 09:55.734
and exhilaration and writing about the type of person I didn't know when we were down to.

09:55.754 --> 09:57.356
Writing about the kind of person I thought I did not know when we were writing.

09:57.376 --> 09:58.698
It was exciting when we were learning about a new feature, really.

09:58.718 --> 10:00.160
And it just became a bad thing with the thesis of the other to religion,

10:01.793 --> 10:13.511
Nicole, but I get the feeling that there's really freedom.

10:13.531 --> 10:20.763
I thought someone's free of your group.

10:20.783 --> 10:21.263
Someone unlike myself.

10:21.283 --> 10:22.545
I can say that's why I was trying to have to bring up Dr. Cori.

10:22.565 --> 10:22.746
The city.

10:22.766 --> 10:22.946
The city.

10:22.966 --> 10:23.286
It's incredible.

10:23.306 --> 10:23.887
Even Nicole and everything.

10:23.907 --> 10:25.590
So it's all over the city.

10:34.767 --> 10:44.638
over those years.

10:44.658 --> 10:54.569
I was amazed that these journalists had the city over us now.

10:54.669 --> 11:00.996
Where were the, never mind Galbraith, where were the O'Harris for the post-World War II period?

11:01.016 --> 11:03.559
Because as I look back on it earlier, O'Harris was going to be an agent, but not the last novel of the city of England.

11:04.147 --> 11:17.299
And at one point, I wanted to do a one-fiction novel of the city.

11:17.319 --> 11:25.106
In fact, I went to the party with any gangplank of Black Panther, but the idea of a chapter in a non-fiction novel.

11:25.126 --> 11:29.529
In fact, it was such a perfect subject to use that picture to write it on the spot.

11:29.549 --> 11:30.350
So I had this thing in my own time.

11:30.370 --> 11:31.751
And finally, I decided, after I finished, I put it on the lifestyle.

11:31.771 --> 11:32.372
But I was just tired of this.

11:32.392 --> 11:33.613
And now they're only using the reporting technique.

11:48.308 --> 12:02.891
I had the whole subplot in this book that I did when it was long enough to do it, but it involved in an artist.

12:02.911 --> 12:05.875
In fact, I had four chapters with it.

12:05.895 --> 12:09.000
I'm going to use it for some time, but I've had a lot of young artists who just came to New York and worked for a video on it.

12:10.060 --> 12:18.923
I had a lot of fun with it, too.

12:18.943 --> 12:21.289
I didn't want my fingers to come.

12:21.309 --> 12:21.851
I had too much money on it.

12:21.871 --> 12:23.074
You know, I had an awful lot of money on it.

13:01.428 --> 13:05.177
couldn't do work in church society.

13:05.197 --> 13:08.244
A lot of times I didn't believe that.

13:08.264 --> 13:16.703
A lot of times I thought that it was just more difficult in a modern city.

13:42.940 --> 13:53.119
I started looking at it and then I looked at my chest.

13:53.139 --> 13:55.363
So I was supposed to start getting water recording.

13:55.383 --> 13:58.649
First thing that's coming up was that I was going to have to get scared about the car.

13:58.669 --> 13:59.170
I kept really passing.

13:59.190 --> 14:01.033
So I said, okay, I'm just going to do the car and I'll do it there.

14:14.328 --> 14:30.150
The structure was one of the hardest things for this person.

14:30.170 --> 14:38.522
When I did it for Rolling Stone, I changed my outline at the last time, thinking, well, I'll just change it one little thing.

14:38.542 --> 14:40.785
I changed the mixture of the mishap that it brings from the accordion to the trouble with the law on the system.

14:40.805 --> 14:42.327
And I gave this guy to me that he changed one little thing in the outline,

14:50.018 --> 14:54.257
So when I did it over, I tightened up my outline.

15:23.768 --> 15:25.459
but it's changed rapidly.

16:25.987 --> 16:28.892
because we're willing to cut corners.

17:10.570 --> 17:33.692
to do, to be strong, to break that rule, just as part of his view to have a mistress, even though he's constantly in a way, left his wife, left his daughter, left his parents, left his home, always he doesn't want to change anything, and he also is owed this other

18:03.473 --> 18:09.113
White afterwards, I think that it doesn't matter in the West.

18:33.680 --> 18:59.528
I say, if anyone thinks this is an unfair picture of the way the ethnic and racial people lined up, living in a way they think about it better, then you go out and take a look and send back your findings to me.

18:59.548 --> 19:00.529
I'm actually going to fall off from one another.

19:00.549 --> 19:01.510
You can't pull punches in a very end.

19:02.266 --> 19:20.866
and have a picture of the average who's sitting here, just like this.

19:20.886 --> 19:24.670
The problem is that all these issues are sometimes related to television drama.

19:24.690 --> 19:26.232
There will be a look, even if it's half-hearted, that's a political hospital.

19:32.607 --> 19:52.056
So if somebody, a certain light soul has to be alive, he creates a higher emphasis.

19:52.076 --> 19:53.939
He heals the woman with another way, and lets everyone see that there's a lot of issues.

19:53.959 --> 19:55.001
And that's what I'm saying, and it's going to go on.

19:55.021 --> 19:55.982
But you know it's going to be like, well,

20:20.549 --> 20:28.722
Did you know from the beginning it was going to be a satire?

20:28.762 --> 20:31.646
To this day, I don't think of it as a satire.

20:31.706 --> 20:38.056
To me, satire consists of taking the facts.

20:39.058 --> 20:44.246
I'm questioning it with some ludicrous.

20:44.266 --> 20:45.588
But you do, exaggeration.

20:45.648 --> 20:47.130
I never thought of it that way.

20:51.160 --> 20:54.319
For example, I have a toy.

21:27.391 --> 21:31.581
That made me feel like I didn't know enough.

21:31.601 --> 21:34.007
I wasn't pushing it far enough.

21:34.027 --> 21:40.422
And this was too open up again for so many of these situations.

22:00.449 --> 22:10.304
And he said, well, it was all on paper when I made it, and it was all on paper when I lost it.

22:10.605 --> 22:11.526
It's a wonderful quote.

22:11.546 --> 22:17.816
I have to believe that one of the toughest things in chapter three that I just statistically went up a lot.

22:17.836 --> 22:22.643
Now, is this something that you intended to do, or perhaps you were unhappy with it?

22:28.343 --> 22:38.856
I tell you, my main view was this.

22:38.876 --> 22:56.598
I knew that I could have ended the book with a happy moment with the last chapter, because in the last chapter, you see Sean McCoy's, I don't know, excitement being thrown out.

22:56.618 --> 22:57.439
It's a very good excitement at that time.

23:01.520 --> 23:17.242
They've done that by the judge.

23:17.382 --> 23:23.430
And I could think of that to make it as soon as it would be that soon as it doubles.

23:23.450 --> 23:24.452
But that was in a very unseen life.

23:24.472 --> 23:28.858
They, in real life, in a case like this, have become a big deal of the issue.

23:28.878 --> 23:29.699
In fact, they would never let go of them.

23:29.719 --> 23:30.780
They would hold on until they've got it on something.

23:30.800 --> 23:31.341
And in this case, they

23:34.898 --> 23:49.574
They had a shot at leaving this thing to us, and it was a film.

23:49.594 --> 23:51.118
And then after this, I mean, my own thighs, they had a possible performance.

24:07.990 --> 24:08.889
and then there's a problem.

25:15.811 --> 25:23.274
That was, you guys, it's down to where it is, because I have to listen to me.

25:23.736 --> 25:27.407
Mr. Nancy, Mr. Nancy, really, it's unbelievable.

26:07.330 --> 26:22.652
Look, he is a scoundrel in the world, and yet he has so much, uh, savvy and just sort of a platter view of what he's doing.

26:22.672 --> 26:27.178
There are a couple of minor characters who are really complex, virtuous, and strong.

26:35.832 --> 26:48.337
He's got the end of his career, but he gets his background.

26:48.758 --> 26:51.163
The other burning place given was the Bureau Chief of the Manifact Bureau of the District Attorney's Office.

26:51.183 --> 26:52.325
There's always a voice of justice to have the discussion.

26:52.345 --> 26:53.908
He goes and wins, and we don't really know when we have to go out there.

27:05.836 --> 27:22.886
I mean, I'm as sympathetic, I mean, I'm as typical of what you found in the city.

27:22.906 --> 27:25.330
Basically, it would be some people who find the pressure of the city itself or feeling like blame for the desire for it.

27:39.974 --> 27:40.435
Yeah.

28:11.092 --> 28:26.333
One review had a really nice idea that Bacon mostly

28:52.165 --> 29:15.574
So at one point, I was going to have a little photograph to explain the fact, the original .

29:22.287 --> 29:29.419
And this is a vanity fair in the 1980s, I think.

29:29.439 --> 29:41.460
But it was not to be, and I didn't know, there was a view of the reality that I left back there, and I think we all have to be in the upper reaches of London society.

29:49.135 --> 29:55.502
going to both high and low, and you have so many different ethnic and racial groups to take them to account.

29:55.522 --> 30:02.531
It must be difficult to avoid stereotyping in the writing.

30:02.551 --> 30:06.315
You must have to keep in mind.

30:06.335 --> 30:08.618
I really have to be very carefully.

30:08.638 --> 30:11.481
Well, except that in many cases, I've never seen

30:29.365 --> 30:33.549
I mean, that's risky.

30:33.689 --> 30:39.395
It's not as fair.

30:39.415 --> 30:46.202
You know, certainly open yourself up to some shots there.

30:46.343 --> 30:57.855
That's true, but you know, I have no idea what job we did.

30:57.875 --> 30:58.275
Any other group?

30:58.998 --> 31:26.743
Also, the Wall Street, on the Wall Street event, you could say, and you say, well, I don't really see that much

31:33.473 --> 32:03.058
You don't see people like her.

32:11.543 --> 32:32.138
And even the criminals have used to be put up like .

32:32.158 --> 32:32.178
.

32:32.198 --> 32:32.218
.

32:54.659 --> 33:14.024
I don't want to show what I saw, what a country man showed us far.

33:14.044 --> 33:16.748
And I have a feeling that it would be criminal justice.

33:16.768 --> 33:17.910
Part of the book, the actual people, how we feel.

33:17.930 --> 33:23.637
Now there's people by ethnicity and race, and categorizing by that, categorizing that type of time.

33:27.751 --> 33:28.792
I have one question.

33:28.812 --> 33:39.844
Is this a one-shot deal, in-your-face kind of novel, and I'm going to go back to my regular work?

33:39.864 --> 33:47.572
Well, if I'm happy when I do that, I haven't decided what to do next.

33:47.592 --> 33:55.161
Really, it wasn't a new direction for you, but just to tell the novel itself to a writer.

33:55.181 --> 33:55.581
I really haven't had

33:56.877 --> 34:21.298
I hope there's a very reasonable amount.

34:29.075 --> 34:40.198
in a particular age.

34:40.218 --> 34:43.405
I feel like I'm challenged myself.

35:18.468 --> 35:22.052
qualities that give a person the right stuff.

35:22.072 --> 35:25.136
I mean, there's this kind of arrogance, this cockiness.

35:25.196 --> 35:29.762
I remember you described the fighter pilot as a plane surgeon.

35:29.782 --> 35:34.768
And you just have the same feeling of, I can't do anything wrong with this guy.

35:34.828 --> 35:36.971
I'm not going to talk about that, but I think you're right.

35:37.471 --> 35:40.375
Just as the pilots felt that they're

35:56.622 --> 36:08.474
Maybe they're going to touch us.

36:08.494 --> 36:21.067
Well, they believe that because they can make my past issues of paper on it, that they really are massive.

36:21.087 --> 36:22.368
There's only this skill of success translates into an inherited.

36:22.388 --> 36:23.509
Therefore, you can deal with making runs out of the law.

36:23.529 --> 36:25.311
When you get an orphan killed in an accident, you can try to live with your wife.

36:25.331 --> 36:25.771
There's a lot of good.

36:25.792 --> 36:26.292
You know, that's right.

36:29.444 --> 36:30.866
I was like, why not?

36:30.907 --> 36:32.028
Just picking that up.

36:32.069 --> 36:33.191
I've got little girls.

36:35.074 --> 36:37.939
I've been a lot of masters with a million dollars.

36:37.959 --> 36:38.860
So I'm familiar with it.

36:38.981 --> 36:42.006
And I go, where the hell are they going to pick this up?

36:42.026 --> 36:43.028
It's the same type of thing.

36:43.048 --> 36:44.951
You start and you say, that's what I'm going to do.

36:45.011 --> 36:46.934
I have to use that, right?

36:46.954 --> 36:48.958
It's as simple as that.

36:49.058 --> 36:53.646
And I guess it's going to say, why would not be a good child.

37:06.586 --> 37:13.074
You'll do the opposite exactly.

37:13.094 --> 37:13.616
You can't master anything.

37:13.636 --> 37:14.520
It's just kind of all studied.
