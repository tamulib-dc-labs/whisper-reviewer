00:01.904 --> 00:31.202
Well, as I say in the book, he introduced himself to me during a religious service on a Friday evening, and I couldn't believe that this very gentle, so-spoken person could be...

00:32.144 --> 00:33.446
could be incarcerated.

00:33.486 --> 00:45.208
And then when I heard the nature of his crime and read that article and spoke to him at length about it, I was convinced that this man is in definite need of mental treatment.

00:45.228 --> 00:47.893
And then he did things while he was in prison.

00:48.053 --> 00:50.939
Yeah, there were incidents.

00:50.959 --> 00:53.864
He got in one fight.

00:53.924 --> 00:56.008
He was beaten up rather badly.

00:56.275 --> 01:06.505
And he was in the general population in a four-man cell, even though they had a mental health unit right next door.

01:07.606 --> 01:19.036
And he seemed to gravitate in finding his friends in the mental health unit, you know, where he belonged, under treatment.

01:19.857 --> 01:20.718
Very sad case.

01:21.579 --> 01:22.860
Now, you see what bothers me?

01:22.940 --> 01:23.801
I give talks.

01:23.821 --> 01:24.882
I give a lot of talks.

01:26.431 --> 01:29.295
And, you know, he committed crimes.

01:30.276 --> 01:31.538
I asked him a question.

01:31.558 --> 01:32.860
It may even be in the book.

01:34.142 --> 01:35.664
I think it's in the book.

01:35.684 --> 01:39.950
I said, Stephen, how many crimes do you think you've committed in your lifetime?

01:39.990 --> 01:43.154
He said, felonies are misdemeanors.

01:43.234 --> 01:44.997
He's pretty cute.

01:45.097 --> 01:46.579
You know, take a pick.

01:46.919 --> 01:49.983
And the amazing thing about him is that he doesn't lie.

01:50.684 --> 01:52.607
Right, right, right.

01:52.891 --> 02:01.246
This is our kind of way, he'll tell you, if you ask him a question, he'll tell you, he fought, and he said about 10,000.

02:01.266 --> 02:08.219
And I think you point this out in the book, if you're caught once, you've probably committed two or three hundred crimes that you haven't been caught for.

02:09.361 --> 02:16.755
So, you know, I certainly feel that he should have been, he deserved some form of punishment.

02:17.208 --> 02:18.490
What, seven years?

02:18.850 --> 02:19.692
Stealing books?

02:19.852 --> 02:23.477
Well, that's one of the big problems we have.

02:23.518 --> 02:26.442
And you discussed this in the books here.

02:26.943 --> 02:30.308
You might even use that as a general way of kind of getting into the discussion.

02:30.328 --> 02:36.557
This rage to punish, one of the things that, you know, people ask, why did I write the book?

02:37.098 --> 02:40.323
I think that's why we're getting into this.

02:40.363 --> 02:43.047
Yeah, and I...

02:43.415 --> 02:46.219
I had second thoughts, a lot of second thoughts.

02:46.299 --> 02:49.664
I had no intention of writing a book, but I kept this journal.

02:49.684 --> 02:52.287
It was really for a catharsis.

02:52.307 --> 02:52.447
Really?

02:52.467 --> 02:53.809
No intention whatsoever.

02:55.812 --> 03:03.623
My wife, who's a clinical social worker, pleaded with me to write the book only because of the manic depression part of it.

03:03.643 --> 03:11.734
She thought it was very important that people know, not as an excuse for antisocial behavior or for criminal acts,

03:12.170 --> 03:16.514
And I make it very clear that I never used it as that, ever.

03:16.534 --> 03:17.535
Not then or now.

03:18.256 --> 03:29.608
But just so that people understand it so they can see it in others, they can see it in themselves, and they can get treatment rather than let the thing spin itself out to the point where it becomes very self-destructive.

03:29.628 --> 03:35.073
I don't know if you've ever read K. Jameson's book, An Unquiet Mind.

03:36.875 --> 03:38.156
It's now in paperback.

03:38.176 --> 03:38.937
It just came out.

03:39.220 --> 03:48.670
She wrote a book called Touched With Fire, where she wrote histories of people who've had manic-depressive illness.

03:48.690 --> 03:50.112
Oh, I know the book.

03:50.192 --> 03:52.975
Okay, basic books that you weren't published?

03:52.995 --> 03:53.556
Yes, right.

03:53.836 --> 03:55.278
And then she came out of the closet.

03:55.938 --> 03:58.161
How do you mean she came out of the closet?

03:58.561 --> 04:03.527
Well, she didn't indicate that she was bipolar in her first book.

04:04.348 --> 04:06.510
She came out of the closet in her second book.

04:06.710 --> 04:11.537
in an unquiet mind by telling of her manic depressive illness.

04:11.557 --> 04:18.088
Now here's a woman who's a high-functioning professor of psychology at Johns Hopkins University.

04:19.089 --> 04:34.573
And yet she functioned for years doing bizarre things and finally self-destructive things and finally went over the edge and then went on medication and is living a relatively normal life now.

04:34.807 --> 04:37.872
Were you mindful of your own manic depression?

04:38.412 --> 04:44.622
I was always... The depression, everyone is always mindful of when you have it.

04:44.782 --> 04:45.984
You know it when you have it.

04:46.144 --> 04:49.950
But did you realize it was a clinical case?

04:49.970 --> 04:50.291
Yeah.

04:50.451 --> 04:57.101
You see, my maternal grandmother had committed suicide by cutting her throat with a kitchen knife.

04:58.083 --> 05:01.708
And depression has always been with me, but never...

05:01.992 --> 05:31.172
so profound that eventually I didn't come out of it the manic part of my bipolar disorder has also always been with me but I was never aware of that because when you're manic you feel very good and you feel very productive and you're you feel very intelligent and you can speak very well you can function very well and what happened was and you know

05:31.439 --> 05:35.604
Without excuse, I had an affair, which was inexcusable.

05:35.624 --> 05:37.065
It was a human weakness.

05:38.127 --> 05:43.933
And then when I went into this very deep depression, I started to self-medicate.

05:43.953 --> 05:47.918
And that's what put me into the hyper-manic and then the manic state.

05:48.499 --> 05:56.788
By taking this vast number of drugs, I took some 1,400 of these Tenuate during a limited period, and the Halcyon.

05:57.713 --> 06:01.418
And then started writing these bizarre letters and doing these bizarre things.

06:01.478 --> 06:04.842
I didn't write about some of the bizarre things I did.

06:04.922 --> 06:05.983
But I've written the New York Times.

06:06.003 --> 06:16.957
Yeah, I mean, putting on cowboy hats and going to Linden, New Jersey.

06:17.037 --> 06:21.983
My wife, who didn't see that bizarre edge, did see

06:22.418 --> 06:31.010
The behavior, she has that diary entry where she suspected drugs had pleaded with me to see a doctor and I wouldn't listen.

06:32.051 --> 06:38.580
So she was very anxious for me to write the book because she wanted people to know that it can happen to anyone.

06:38.600 --> 06:40.503
So she saw it as a therapeutic answer.

06:40.523 --> 06:42.646
Exactly, exactly.

06:43.306 --> 06:51.818
And the other part I wrote with respect to prisons and sentencing and so forth, which is really, as the title suggests, what the book is about,

06:52.253 --> 06:55.758
Well, let's talk about the after the madness.

06:55.778 --> 07:00.665
So clearly there was, as you just described it, a period of madness.

07:00.685 --> 07:01.727
Yes, yes.

07:01.747 --> 07:02.989
You definitely call it mental illness.

07:03.229 --> 07:04.611
Yes, yes.

07:04.872 --> 07:14.566
And it was so diagnosed, not only by the many psychiatrists who treated me before I went to prison, but also when I got into prison.

07:14.586 --> 07:20.134
I was originally scheduled to go to a camp in Pensacola, Florida.

07:20.452 --> 07:30.848
And three days before I left, the Bureau of Prisons, having my medical records, said we want him to go to a prison that has a mental health component.

07:30.868 --> 07:31.710
That has one.

07:31.770 --> 07:41.004
Yeah, that has one, which is Butner, North Carolina, which is where I spent all my time at Butner before I was stabbed, in the mental health unit.

07:42.226 --> 07:47.775
And then after I was stabbed and after the solitary confinement,

07:48.920 --> 07:51.103
They wanted to send me out for my own protection.

07:52.605 --> 07:57.672
And they had to send me to another hospital that had a mental health component, and that was Rochester.

07:57.692 --> 08:01.837
There were only three in the federal system that had mental health units.

08:01.918 --> 08:04.341
Springfield, that's right.

08:04.561 --> 08:09.768
So they sent me to Rochester, where I also went in the mental health unit.

08:09.788 --> 08:17.779
Eventually I was discharged into the general population when they felt they never took me off my medication, but they felt I was in balance and

08:18.113 --> 08:22.658
So you're taking medication?

08:22.958 --> 08:23.258
Oh, yes.

08:23.559 --> 08:24.099
Yeah.

08:24.159 --> 08:38.595
Did you feel that once you had fallen into the hands of these prison officials that they singled you out for any kind of... I think there are three kinds of guards.

08:38.835 --> 08:39.636
It's almost sadistic.

08:39.696 --> 08:40.937
There are three kinds of guards.

08:42.118 --> 08:47.344
And you know which one of the categories they fall in very quickly.

08:47.915 --> 08:52.843
There's the one who thinks that his job or her job is to punish you.

08:52.863 --> 08:58.331
They think, you know, I'm part of the punishment system without recognizing that being sent to prison is the punishment.

08:59.893 --> 09:01.255
The second are the bullies.

09:02.337 --> 09:03.479
They're the worst.

09:03.940 --> 09:10.490
They will come up to you and wash their, what are you sitting on that bench for?

09:10.510 --> 09:11.852
Well, I was tired.

09:11.972 --> 09:12.673
I wanted to sit down.

09:13.092 --> 09:16.396
You don't sit on a bench unless I tell you to sit on a bench.

09:16.756 --> 09:20.981
And if I tell you that's the bench you sit on, I'm sorry.

09:21.121 --> 09:24.045
And I sit on this bench.

09:24.405 --> 09:25.627
And then he says, wait a minute.

09:25.647 --> 09:27.169
Did I tell you you could sit on that bench?

09:27.689 --> 09:29.071
Get your ass off that bench.

09:29.131 --> 09:29.892
I'll throw you in the hole.

09:30.532 --> 09:32.895
This is just, you know, he gets off on this.

09:33.336 --> 09:40.524
And then the third is a decent guard who recognizes his or her responsibility and treats the prisoners like people.

09:41.265 --> 09:42.947
Not that they're easy or soft

09:43.383 --> 09:47.788
But they don't bully you and they don't punish you, which is what a guard should be.

09:49.049 --> 09:50.231
But was I singled out?

09:50.431 --> 09:56.377
I think that the bully guards enjoyed bullying me more than they enjoyed bullying other people.

09:57.479 --> 10:02.564
But I certainly wasn't given a preparatory treatment.

10:02.644 --> 10:07.710
At what point did you realize that there would be a book here and not really a therapeutic exercise?

10:07.970 --> 10:11.634
When I... I'm just checking myself.

10:11.815 --> 10:12.175
I...

10:14.146 --> 10:27.601
I was listening, I tell this in my introduction, but I was listening to a radio talk show, and I listened to those things, although I just can't stand them.

10:28.582 --> 10:38.694
Rush Limbaugh was the one I referred to, and there we talked about, you know, we've got to put two people in a cell, and I was in a cell with three others, saying, what do you know?

10:39.575 --> 10:43.579
But I was listening to a fellow who wrote a book called Criminal Justice, and he was being interviewed.

10:44.183 --> 10:47.970
by a fellow named Bob Grant in New York.

10:49.493 --> 10:56.046
And he started talking about how easy the prisoners have it and how we've got to be tougher on prison owners.

10:56.667 --> 10:58.551
And he didn't know what he was talking about.

10:58.811 --> 11:03.360
And then in the middle of it, he says, and I know what I'm talking about because I visited these prisons.

11:03.901 --> 11:06.506
So Bob Grant says, oh, well, you know, we're talking to an expert.

11:06.866 --> 11:07.187
Yeah.

11:07.505 --> 11:12.731
And that afternoon I had lunch with a fellow named Sam Roberts from the New York Times.

11:12.831 --> 11:14.753
He was editor of the Weekend Review.

11:15.373 --> 11:18.437
And I was, you know, I was angry.

11:18.457 --> 11:19.878
And I said, this is so wrong.

11:20.499 --> 11:37.157
Not because they say this, who cares what they say on a talk show host, but because people hear this and believe it and then urge their politicians to become more repressive and then they become tougher on, they take away more of the abilities to rehabilitate

11:37.829 --> 11:40.453
You know, they cancel lapel grants.

11:40.794 --> 11:42.817
You can't learn anything in prison.

11:42.837 --> 11:45.762
They take away the addiction treatment program.

11:45.782 --> 11:49.328
So you come in as an addict and you go out and you become an addict again.

11:49.689 --> 11:50.550
It's self-defeating.

11:51.412 --> 11:54.176
So I told him this and I told him stories.

11:54.217 --> 11:56.901
He said, you should write this down.

11:57.843 --> 11:59.265
So I said, actually, I have.

11:59.285 --> 12:00.106
I've kept a journal.

12:00.126 --> 12:01.828
He says, can you send me parts of it?

12:01.848 --> 12:03.069
And I sent him part of the journal.

12:03.130 --> 12:03.951
And he printed it.

12:04.191 --> 12:05.452
Now you sent this to whom again?

12:05.472 --> 12:08.316
This was Sam Roberts from the New York Times.

12:08.336 --> 12:10.238
And he printed it in the Week in Review.

12:11.260 --> 12:18.929
And then I received, you know, so many people came to me that I should put this in a book, that it could, you know, have some benefits.

12:19.991 --> 12:21.032
So I met with my family.

12:21.472 --> 12:25.217
And I said, you know, this is going to reopen a lot of rooms.

12:26.783 --> 12:28.445
Things were just starting to quiet down.

12:28.485 --> 12:29.867
People were starting to forget.

12:29.927 --> 12:31.028
Four years had passed.

12:32.210 --> 12:36.215
And they pleaded with me to do it, and I did it.

12:37.296 --> 12:39.339
And it did open the wounds.

12:40.260 --> 12:47.469
And I go to a lot of these interviews, and I want to talk about the book, and they only want to talk about the affair.

12:48.330 --> 12:50.373
Did I ask you a single question about that?

12:50.393 --> 12:51.154
I don't think they had a question.

12:51.387 --> 12:55.592
I said I haven't asked you a single question about that.

12:55.612 --> 12:55.912
No, no, no.

12:55.952 --> 12:56.733
They want to talk about this.

12:56.773 --> 12:58.255
What's going to ask you about this?

12:58.996 --> 12:59.617
Yeah, yeah.

12:59.717 --> 13:07.286
I want to talk about the bipolar disorder, not as an excuse, but I think it's important that people be aware of the fact that it's out there.

13:08.267 --> 13:11.471
And a lot of people have been afflicted by it.

13:12.512 --> 13:16.517
We don't hear about it because not all of them do as Margot Kidder did, you know.

13:16.683 --> 13:22.953
end up in the bushes somewhere, and not all of them end up going to prison by doing anti-social things as I did.

13:22.973 --> 13:23.894
But there are a lot of people.

13:23.974 --> 13:42.302
This doctor at the Payne Whitney, Dr. Miller, told me that he has a hundred cases a year of CEOs, important, prominent, intelligent, functioning, productive people, like Ted Turner, who's bipolar.

13:42.907 --> 13:44.109
Ted Turner?

13:44.129 --> 13:46.173
Yeah, Ted Turner's bipolar.

13:46.213 --> 13:53.305
If Ted Turner didn't take his lithium for a few days, you know, this book by Katherine Graham, this recent book.

13:54.367 --> 13:55.248
Which I interviewed her.

13:55.268 --> 13:58.654
Yeah, well, her husband was bipolar.

13:58.674 --> 14:02.180
And I remember Larry King was interviewing her.

14:03.002 --> 14:06.788
And he said, how could he function?

14:07.409 --> 14:08.952
If he was mentally ill.

14:09.694 --> 14:10.676
No, no, no, no, no.

14:10.816 --> 14:11.438
It's interesting.

14:11.698 --> 14:18.333
So now I'm on his show and he says to me, and he says to me, how could you function if you're mentally ill?

14:18.353 --> 14:20.959
I said, you know, you asked the same question, Catherine Graham.

14:21.680 --> 14:23.625
I said, and what she told you, I will tell you.

14:24.186 --> 14:27.493
When you're bipolar, you can function very, very well until.

14:27.760 --> 14:28.742
It goes too far.

14:28.822 --> 14:30.325
I didn't see this.

14:30.485 --> 14:34.192
What was his response to you telling him what somebody has already said?

14:34.212 --> 14:34.412
Yeah.

14:34.472 --> 14:37.558
No, he says, yeah, he was editor of the Washington Post.

14:37.839 --> 14:40.043
Like that made the point.

14:40.844 --> 14:41.545
Like I remember.

14:41.726 --> 14:42.487
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:42.567 --> 14:43.469
I know who he was.

14:43.749 --> 14:45.693
What are you trying to tell me I'm not smart?

14:45.713 --> 14:45.833
Yeah.

14:46.615 --> 14:49.059
Well, I mean, just look at that situation.

14:49.079 --> 14:49.741
He came home.

14:49.781 --> 14:50.562
They were talking...

14:50.778 --> 14:54.063
And then he said, I'm going to go take a nap.

14:54.243 --> 15:00.793
And a few days beforehand, she writes how he made a speech that was, you know... Brilliant.

15:00.813 --> 15:01.133
Brilliant.

15:01.153 --> 15:03.557
And then another one which is babbling.

15:03.617 --> 15:14.914
And, you know, the funny thing is that all about a month before I was arrested, I was asked to speak to a group of teachers on the Constitution.

15:16.256 --> 15:19.080
And it suddenly occurred to me

15:19.482 --> 15:21.124
But they didn't really want to hear that speech.

15:22.206 --> 15:22.747
I knew better.

15:23.488 --> 15:29.517
They wanted to hear a speech about some arcane legal doctrine, Reyes Judicata.

15:29.857 --> 15:32.541
No, not Reyes, Reyes Ipsilocator.

15:33.843 --> 15:38.670
And so I went out there and I delivered this speech on Reyes Ipsilocator.

15:38.690 --> 15:39.592
And they all applauded.

15:40.813 --> 15:45.000
The chief judge, speaking to them, must be smart what I said, right?

15:46.061 --> 15:48.645
And I went over to my assistant and said, what was that all about?

15:49.553 --> 15:53.939
And I said, you know, it shows you how slow you are.

15:53.959 --> 15:54.460
They knew.

15:55.281 --> 15:55.641
I knew.

15:55.662 --> 15:57.104
Why can't you know?

15:57.784 --> 15:58.946
This is what they wanted to hear.

15:58.986 --> 16:00.588
They didn't want to hear about the Constitution.

16:02.471 --> 16:04.193
And, you know, things like that.

16:06.817 --> 16:09.901
I've often said, and I say in the book, I wish I'd been arrested sooner.

16:10.823 --> 16:15.409
You also say that there's a suggestion there that they...

16:16.216 --> 16:18.939
They were waiting for you to do something more serious.

16:18.959 --> 16:21.142
Oh, no question about it.

16:21.542 --> 16:22.083
How do you feel about that?

16:22.103 --> 16:22.924
I think it was wrong.

16:23.365 --> 16:24.226
I think it was wrong.

16:24.486 --> 16:27.069
In your case or in general?

16:27.089 --> 16:27.590
In general.

16:28.310 --> 16:39.203
You see, what's happened is, and I note the fact that district attorneys are elected in most areas and U.S.

16:39.284 --> 16:40.485
attorneys are appointed.

16:41.478 --> 16:54.154
It's very important for them to maintain a high profile, either to be re-elected or to be reappointed, or if they're not reappointed, to go on to something else that's productive, which was the case of my U.S.

16:54.214 --> 16:54.554
attorney.

16:54.774 --> 17:04.726
He knew this crime was committed, or I was arrested, right before the election.

17:06.328 --> 17:07.610
Excuse me, right after the election.

17:07.630 --> 17:08.852
Right after the election.

17:08.872 --> 17:10.894
Right after the election.

17:11.245 --> 17:13.749
Bush was not re-elected, so he wasn't going to be reappointed.

17:14.310 --> 17:20.319
He had to make a great reputation real quick.

17:21.020 --> 17:22.041
Did he get reappointed?

17:23.343 --> 17:24.565
No.

17:24.585 --> 17:24.645
No.

17:24.665 --> 17:26.909
But he got to stay on along with any other U.S.

17:26.969 --> 17:29.933
attorney in the country because he kept saying, I have to prosecute this case.

17:31.115 --> 17:39.548
And then after it was over, he was given an appointment by the Republican senators, by Aldermano, to...

17:40.203 --> 17:41.785
to conduct the Whitewater hearings.

17:42.346 --> 17:45.870
So he, you know, he built a great reputation on this.

17:48.132 --> 17:55.321
Oh, yes.

17:55.541 --> 17:57.543
Oh, there's no question.

17:57.564 --> 18:00.147
The FBI is the U.S.

18:00.207 --> 18:09.838
attorneys, at least there was in this instance, and I've been in touch with the present director of the FBI to tell that this is something that should be stopped if it still goes on.

18:10.190 --> 18:18.743
In every case, though, I mean, what if you're really trying to make a case on some drug dealers or career criminals?

18:21.407 --> 18:27.796
Maybe you have knowledge that they're going to do something, but you could arrest them on something lesser at this particular point.

18:28.537 --> 18:29.459
No, no, no.

18:29.579 --> 18:30.881
Depends on the crime.

18:30.901 --> 18:31.682
Depends on the crime.

18:32.143 --> 18:34.085
Depends on the crime.

18:34.146 --> 18:38.492
If, in my case, I was acting alone,

18:38.641 --> 18:39.422
They knew that.

18:40.043 --> 18:44.748
They had been following me for over a month.

18:44.768 --> 18:45.949
They knew it was me.

18:47.831 --> 18:53.938
They took a telephone off the wall, a public phone that had my fingerprints on me.

18:54.618 --> 18:56.761
They had everything.

18:57.121 --> 19:04.429
They wired her apartment and were feeding her lines for me to, you know,

19:05.202 --> 19:15.611
The way they finally got me on the big thing was... Whenever I say this, it sounds like I'm blaming someone else.

19:15.851 --> 19:21.696
I'm raising it as an issue.

19:21.837 --> 19:25.620
It's interesting because there's a dialogue.

19:26.200 --> 19:32.546
I call up and I say, I'm a very sick man.

19:33.046 --> 19:34.888
I'm trying to be this other person.

19:35.206 --> 19:37.329
As if she knew it was me, I figured.

19:37.429 --> 19:38.450
And of course she knows it's me.

19:40.793 --> 19:46.159
By this time, there's an absolute doubt it's me because I've been under surveillance.

19:46.540 --> 19:48.963
And I had a voice changing machine that wasn't working.

19:49.103 --> 19:51.746
So she's listening to the same voice she heard for eight years.

19:53.548 --> 19:54.009
Every day.

19:54.029 --> 19:56.172
We used to speak so many, four or five times a day.

19:56.192 --> 19:57.693
You didn't ever pull?

19:57.713 --> 19:59.796
No, I was, no.

20:00.063 --> 20:04.708
No, I mean, it was just, you see, your judgment becomes so skewed.

20:04.748 --> 20:13.778
So I'm talking to her, and I'm saying, I'm a very sick man, and then she says, what do you want to leave me alone?

20:14.599 --> 20:15.019
She said?

20:15.080 --> 20:16.101
Yeah.

20:16.121 --> 20:19.344
So I said, you don't understand something.

20:19.364 --> 20:20.245
She said, what do you want?

20:20.285 --> 20:23.148
How much money do you want for me to leave me alone?

20:23.168 --> 20:24.470
So I said, $200,000.

20:24.850 --> 20:27.874
So then I said, wait a minute, that's asking for too much.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.175
I said, $20,000.

20:29.999 --> 20:34.944
And then she says, and if I pay you, will you leave me alone?

20:35.705 --> 20:38.468
I said, yes, but I don't want to talk about that.

20:38.488 --> 20:42.232
I want to tell you about the fact that I'm wearing a diaper and I'm stuck in two yards.

20:43.573 --> 20:46.136
And then she says, what will you do with my child?

20:47.137 --> 20:50.380
I never mention her child.

20:50.400 --> 20:53.603
And I said, it's almost like you're being sent up here for extortion.

20:53.623 --> 20:55.605
Oh, yeah, yeah.

20:55.625 --> 20:56.566
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

20:56.746 --> 20:58.268
And if she had asked me,

20:58.417 --> 20:59.919
Will you murder someone?

21:00.199 --> 21:02.622
I would have said yes, I know anything.

21:03.403 --> 21:09.831
So now they get all this and they let me keep on for another 10 days.

21:10.873 --> 21:11.474
No, excuse me.

21:11.494 --> 21:13.636
No, this was one of the first calls.

21:13.736 --> 21:15.058
They could have nailed you right there.

21:15.078 --> 21:22.588
Oh, they could have nailed me the very first day because I was harassing her for harassment.

21:22.688 --> 21:25.251
So now...

21:26.564 --> 21:32.031
That would have ruined your career, though, even at... Yeah, well, you know... I mean, even at the first, that would have done it.

21:32.452 --> 21:39.942
I remember when I was in the military police, we had a captain who was misbehaving terribly.

21:39.962 --> 21:41.304
And I went to him.

21:42.305 --> 21:44.228
His name was Pfeiffer.

21:44.248 --> 21:50.036
And I said, Captain, you've done this, that, and the other thing.

21:50.196 --> 21:51.397
We could arrest you for this.

21:51.558 --> 21:52.699
You could be court-martialed.

21:52.719 --> 21:54.782
You could be sent away for 10 years.

21:55.387 --> 21:58.071
Resign for the good of the service.

21:58.091 --> 22:00.534
Resign for the good of the service.

22:00.554 --> 22:02.276
And forget about it.

22:03.618 --> 22:04.119
And get yourself treated.

22:04.139 --> 22:04.599
And he did.

22:04.619 --> 22:06.482
And was.

22:06.502 --> 22:09.666
And that was the end of it.

22:09.686 --> 22:24.145
The reason, and this is an interesting thing, Nick, the reason that Joy, this woman, took all these letters that I'd sent and got on a plane and flew to Bill Sessions, who was her friend,

22:24.985 --> 22:30.511
And he then calls the U.S.

22:30.591 --> 22:31.652
attorney in New Jersey.

22:32.273 --> 22:33.875
Now, mind you, I'm from New York.

22:34.636 --> 22:35.877
The victim is from New York.

22:36.217 --> 22:37.378
Everything is done in New York.

22:37.839 --> 22:44.767
But one card was sent from New Jersey, and so that gave New Jersey a nexus.

22:45.247 --> 22:47.790
So he calls up the U.S.

22:47.830 --> 22:48.651
attorney in New Jersey.

22:49.432 --> 22:49.772
The U.S.

22:49.792 --> 22:51.634
attorney in New Jersey never...

22:52.660 --> 22:54.262
spoke to the U.S.

22:54.282 --> 22:59.788
attorney in New York, never spoke to the FBI in New York.

22:59.808 --> 23:02.511
And the reason was that I knew the U.S.

23:02.531 --> 23:07.697
attorneys in New York, they would have come to me, or if they were merciful, they would have arrested me.

23:08.978 --> 23:11.902
In any event, my career was over.

23:11.922 --> 23:12.823
But instead, the U.S.

23:12.843 --> 23:21.132
attorney in New Jersey, using the FBI as his private army, and according to the press reports, it was between 80 and 100 agents,

23:21.719 --> 23:28.108
following all over the country.

23:28.128 --> 23:28.348
Yeah.

23:29.610 --> 23:31.994
For one month.

23:32.014 --> 23:33.876
For one month.

23:33.896 --> 23:34.377
Yeah.

23:34.898 --> 23:35.358
Yeah.

23:35.599 --> 23:38.583
Oh, it's a terrible thing.

23:38.663 --> 23:39.504
No.

23:39.745 --> 23:41.587
This is something I've told no one else.

23:41.607 --> 23:43.390
Between you and me, you swear?

23:43.830 --> 23:44.291
You swear?

23:44.672 --> 23:45.353
Yeah.

23:45.373 --> 23:45.493
Okay.

23:47.576 --> 23:51.321
At the same time as they were on surveillance of me,

23:51.672 --> 24:14.974
They had no surveillance on the mosque in Jersey City, although they knew that Rachman, who was on a wanted list and a watch list, was there, that Yusuf had come in with a false passport and he was there, that all the meetings were being held in the Jersey City mosque cooking up the World Trade Center.

24:15.275 --> 24:18.658
It happened just during that month that they were there.

24:19.263 --> 24:22.489
And they said, why didn't anyone see this?

24:22.689 --> 24:33.367
Because the Egyptian ambassador told them to watch Rahman and watch the mosque because he tried to assassinate Mubarak.

24:33.808 --> 24:35.771
So he was someone to watch.

24:36.172 --> 24:43.785
And then Yusuf came in with a false passport and sought political asylum and went to live in a building right next door to the mosque.

24:44.457 --> 24:51.989
And then they converted over $100,000 during this process, laundered it to buy the material, and they were all chasing this nut.

24:54.213 --> 24:55.996
But it was a wonderful high profile.

24:56.016 --> 25:00.182
And then, and this is from his own account, the U.S.

25:00.202 --> 25:03.568
Attorney's own account, they wanted me to pick up this money.

25:03.588 --> 25:05.190
Well, I wasn't going to pick up the money.

25:05.230 --> 25:06.212
I didn't even, you know...

25:07.728 --> 25:10.410
And so I'm on my way home from Albany.

25:11.031 --> 25:12.632
See, then they would have had a heavier charge.

25:12.732 --> 25:16.075
Oh, God, then they would have had me for extortion.

25:16.095 --> 25:17.977
All these things, which really would have made it.

25:18.337 --> 25:18.698
Sure.

25:18.738 --> 25:21.620
I'm not saying it's not a legitimate case.

25:21.680 --> 25:23.081
No, no, sure.

25:23.382 --> 25:25.123
Serious stuff.

25:25.143 --> 25:29.907
So then I'm driving home, and then you talk about normal police work.

25:29.927 --> 25:36.233
Now, I was in the military police, and I know that you never apprehend a felon

25:36.803 --> 25:47.258
unless he's on a warrant notice and he's fleeing, or he's on his way to commit a crime, or he's returning from a crime, or he's armed and dangerous.

25:48.140 --> 25:51.124
Otherwise, you have him self-surrender, or you arrest him at home.

25:52.146 --> 25:53.327
Not on the highway.

25:53.347 --> 25:53.768
Not on the highway.

25:54.609 --> 25:57.714
And there was the Long Island Express, there were 1 o'clock in the afternoon.

25:57.734 --> 26:01.019
Well, things are going to happen, as they often do.

26:01.039 --> 26:01.319
Like?

26:02.060 --> 26:03.182
Well, I mean, I mean...

26:03.854 --> 26:06.278
You could have started a high-speed chase.

26:06.298 --> 26:07.480
People could have been killed.

26:07.500 --> 26:10.545
Oh, I'll tell you, you know, the funny thing is I thought they were terrorists.

26:11.266 --> 26:11.787
Is that right?

26:11.847 --> 26:21.323
Yeah, and so, you know, I quickly, you know, locked my doors, and then they slapped the badge against the window, because we were told, you know, all the high-profile

26:21.623 --> 26:29.176
Public officials were always told that you're always in danger of and you have to be careful of.

26:29.757 --> 26:39.113
But I've never carried a weapon since... You know, what I'm saying is instead of waiting for you to go home as they could have... I was five minutes away.

26:39.493 --> 26:41.116
The next exit.

26:41.136 --> 26:44.121
Even waiting until I got on my quiet street.

26:44.658 --> 26:46.840
I wonder what the traffic says.

26:46.900 --> 26:48.662
Why did they decide to do it right there?

26:49.002 --> 26:50.864
I mean, the radio traffic.

26:50.884 --> 26:54.447
Well, the New Jersey Law Journal said that the U.S.

26:54.487 --> 26:55.828
Attorney made a circus of this.

26:56.769 --> 27:00.833
The New York Post read an editorial which criticized this.

27:01.333 --> 27:07.539
But it was obviously done because it would make the primetime news that evening.

27:07.559 --> 27:09.041
Page one of the New York Times.

27:09.061 --> 27:11.203
Yeah, above the center point.

27:11.463 --> 27:12.604
Above the fold.

27:12.624 --> 27:12.724
Yeah.

27:13.109 --> 27:17.896
Look, that's irrelevant.

27:17.916 --> 27:18.957
That's all irrelevant.

27:19.057 --> 27:19.658
It really is.

27:20.520 --> 27:36.843
And the... If I wanted to accomplish anything negative in this book, it was to criticize, which I did, the U.S.

27:36.863 --> 27:39.827
Attorney for Handling's.

27:39.847 --> 27:41.209
It's after the fact, but...

27:42.387 --> 27:45.413
People shouldn't do this and get away with it.

27:45.433 --> 27:47.457
Not to me, not to you, not to anyone else.

27:49.121 --> 27:52.187
So let's talk a few issues now then, too.

27:54.211 --> 28:02.547
Really, I mean, as much as anyone, I don't know if any other judges of your stature have had to go through this.

28:02.567 --> 28:03.349
Fortunately not.

28:03.498 --> 28:11.588
but you really have had an opportunity quite dramatically to see the justice system from both sides.

28:11.648 --> 28:16.874
I mean, that is a unique perspective, wouldn't you say?

28:16.934 --> 28:17.956
Oh, yes, it is.

28:19.097 --> 28:19.518
It's a vantage point.

28:19.538 --> 28:19.758
That's one.

28:19.778 --> 28:21.861
You've had two vantage points.

28:21.881 --> 28:23.242
It's a word for the honor, you know.

28:23.282 --> 28:25.325
I just assume not a bad issue.

28:25.345 --> 28:26.186
Well, I agree.

28:26.206 --> 28:28.108
It pains me to question you.

28:28.128 --> 28:29.690
I'd much rather be calling you governor.

28:30.111 --> 28:31.372
Yeah, thank you.

28:31.412 --> 28:32.053
Which would have...

28:33.164 --> 28:34.506
may well have come to pass.

28:35.207 --> 28:35.728
Who knows?

28:35.748 --> 28:41.797
Well, or I also could have killed myself, which is where I was going.

28:41.897 --> 28:42.618
You think?

28:42.639 --> 28:43.219
Oh, yeah.

28:43.259 --> 28:51.993
Let's say, had they not picked up on this, and had you come to your senses and deceased from what you were doing, what do you think would have happened?

28:52.013 --> 28:54.156
Do you think you were still heading for a tragic end?

28:54.176 --> 28:59.364
There were so many times when I did something like this, and I said, I don't want to do that anymore.

28:59.705 --> 29:00.806
That's finished.

29:00.826 --> 29:01.247
And then,

29:01.582 --> 29:12.977
my mind would start going, do you know how sometimes you have this crazy thought at night right before you go to sleep, and then you get up in the morning and you remember it and you think how crazy it was?

29:13.278 --> 29:15.120
It's silly, but also scary.

29:15.320 --> 29:24.052
Yeah, well, when I had those thoughts at night, I'd get up in the morning and I'd think they were twice as brilliant as I did the night before.

29:24.092 --> 29:25.494
That's what happened.

29:25.514 --> 29:26.475
I said, God...

29:26.675 --> 29:31.420
That was incredibly brilliant.

29:31.600 --> 29:33.542
I'd say it's sad.

29:33.823 --> 29:35.485
That sounds self-serving.

29:35.885 --> 29:38.708
But it's sad because I don't have it.

29:39.129 --> 29:40.550
I don't have it now.

29:41.211 --> 29:44.034
And I just pity those who live with this now.

29:44.114 --> 29:47.918
And there are hundreds out there who do and could be treated.

29:47.938 --> 29:48.939
And that's very sad.

29:49.160 --> 29:50.461
Do you think you wanted to be governor?

29:51.122 --> 29:51.342
Yes.

29:53.444 --> 29:56.007
You weren't secretly trying to undermine your own

29:56.611 --> 30:15.158
No, no, I really did want to be governor, very much, and I thought I could be a good governor, I had some wonderful ideas, and it just wasn't going to be.

30:15.178 --> 30:22.669
I think that as soon as I was treated, though, I could never have gone any further.

30:22.801 --> 30:37.659
Although the psychiatrist at Payne Whitney said, if your focus had been on campaigning and your manic energy set to develop in that direction, you could have been President of the United States.

30:39.081 --> 30:39.902
I had one story.

30:40.703 --> 30:44.207
I didn't tell this in the book, but you reminded me of it.

30:44.227 --> 30:52.437
When I was in the Payne Whitney, some young intern, a psychiatric intern, came over and started interviewing him.

30:53.362 --> 30:55.444
And he didn't know who I was or what I was.

30:55.544 --> 31:01.892
And I started telling him that I was the chief judge of New York and that I could have... Yeah, yeah.

31:01.992 --> 31:04.494
And he said, that's interesting.

31:04.555 --> 31:06.897
And he says, were you going to go to any other office?

31:06.917 --> 31:09.680
I said, well, I was thinking of running for governor.

31:10.101 --> 31:11.923
And he said, and did you ever think of... Can I use this story?

31:12.544 --> 31:13.445
Yeah, yes, sure.

31:13.725 --> 31:15.166
Sure, it's a true story.

31:15.186 --> 31:18.170
And then he said, did you ever think of running for president?

31:19.471 --> 31:20.112
And I said...

31:20.429 --> 31:21.230
I'm sorry.

31:22.092 --> 31:25.879
And then suddenly it dawned on me that, you know, what was going on.

31:25.899 --> 31:28.003
And I said, no, I said, I'm very serious.

31:28.063 --> 31:29.605
He says, I know you're very serious.

31:29.686 --> 31:33.152
I just want to know whether you are very serious about running for president.

31:34.214 --> 31:38.541
So then I realized that, you know, I said, I just, I'm thinking about running for governor.

31:38.562 --> 31:39.443
And then I just.

31:39.463 --> 31:41.627
Who is this?

31:42.046 --> 31:42.787
Payne Whitney.

31:43.167 --> 31:46.330
Payne Whitney, which is part of Cornell Medical School.

31:46.350 --> 31:47.631
And this guy didn't know any work?

31:47.911 --> 31:49.072
No, no, no.

31:49.092 --> 31:52.696
He was just doing rounds, you know, and just saying how you're feeling, you know.

31:52.716 --> 31:56.099
And if you ever thought that you might like to be Pope.

31:56.119 --> 31:57.220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:57.240 --> 31:59.242
Well, you know, that sounds reasonable.

31:59.622 --> 32:08.710
And I'm sure that he had this from a lot of people as he went around, you know, who were having schizophrenic episodes.

32:08.890 --> 32:10.652
But it seems you have a sense of humor, right?

32:11.003 --> 32:11.764
Oh, God.

32:11.884 --> 32:17.733
I mean, it's morbid, but does it have a sense of humor?

32:18.655 --> 32:30.413
If you can't laugh at this, you know, my family will sit around and we'll talk and I'll say something and then one of my daughters will say, uh-oh.

32:30.832 --> 32:33.175
Dad's going to go get the cowboy hat again.

32:33.195 --> 32:35.979
So you've got to laugh.

32:36.019 --> 32:38.142
You just cry all the time.

32:38.382 --> 32:43.889
You know, it's an interesting time that we're in.

32:43.909 --> 32:56.586
In terms of 20 years ago, it would have been a groundswell of 25 years of support, interest, sympathy for prisoners,

32:57.005 --> 33:01.089
rights or whatever you want to call it, the welfare, but not today.

33:01.529 --> 33:02.470
Gone just the opposite.

33:02.830 --> 33:06.013
And, you know... Just the opposite.

33:07.255 --> 33:10.698
What do you think the public attitude should be?

33:10.718 --> 33:14.241
Taking into account, of course, you know, our concern about crime.

33:14.261 --> 33:14.621
That's it.

33:14.641 --> 33:22.629
You see, what's happened is the public has tended, and this is something that I guess I was guilty of this as well.

33:22.689 --> 33:25.932
I just never focused until I was there to

33:26.553 --> 33:29.857
We tend to lump prisoners together.

33:32.320 --> 33:42.052
We don't draw the distinction between violent and nonviolent, between those people who can be rehabilitated and those who cannot be.

33:42.572 --> 33:45.275
We tend to think in terms of rehabilitation has failed.

33:45.896 --> 33:50.822
Well, rehabilitation has failed when it comes to the sociopaths and the

33:51.089 --> 33:53.472
hard, violent criminals.

33:54.052 --> 33:57.516
And that's all we used to have in prison at one time.

33:57.536 --> 33:59.619
At one time, that was your prison population.

34:00.139 --> 34:01.982
You couldn't rehabilitate them.

34:02.002 --> 34:12.614
Now our prison population has grown beyond measure, and 70% or more are of a different kind entirely who can be rehabilitated.

34:13.215 --> 34:18.801
But you go to someone, in fact, if you had gone to me,

34:19.979 --> 34:25.886
six, seven years ago, I would have said to you, rehabilitation just hasn't worked.

34:26.907 --> 34:28.469
This hasn't worked.

34:28.489 --> 34:31.012
And it didn't work on the population of that time.

34:31.132 --> 34:34.315
But now, as I say, we have an entirely different population.

34:34.335 --> 34:41.263
In this country where we have, for every 100,000 in our population, we have 500 people behind bars.

34:42.024 --> 34:46.329
Compare that to England, which has 95, or Japan, which has 45.

34:46.349 --> 34:47.711
We have 500.

34:48.592 --> 34:49.733
So that...

34:50.303 --> 34:51.244
We look at these people.

34:51.404 --> 34:54.787
Do we have more crime, or do we just have much more severe crime?

34:55.007 --> 34:55.748
No, no, no.

34:56.348 --> 34:59.251
It's the drug, the war on drugs.

35:00.112 --> 35:03.855
Now, the war on drugs has not been won, okay?

35:03.875 --> 35:07.758
Drug use today is the same as it's always been.

35:07.858 --> 35:11.862
And you keep locking them up and keep locking them up for longer and longer terms.

35:12.042 --> 35:19.028
Every time you lock up a drug dealer, another one is going to take his place, or two more will take his place.

35:19.582 --> 35:21.744
So you say, well, wait a minute.

35:21.764 --> 35:34.434
I was with the Babe Buchanan the other day on her television show, and after it was over, she said, you know, it seems to me that even though we're locking up an awful lot of people, crime has gone down in the cities.

35:36.296 --> 35:36.636
That's gone down.

35:36.656 --> 35:36.756
Yeah.

35:36.776 --> 35:39.178
And I think that's why.

35:39.499 --> 35:42.241
And that becomes now the mythology.

35:42.261 --> 35:43.242
Not so at all.

35:43.262 --> 35:47.285
It has no relationship to that, and that's been shown.

35:47.305 --> 35:49.487
The reason crime has gone down are two

35:51.188 --> 35:56.236
One is increased police patrol and increased police presence.

35:57.097 --> 36:00.022
More police officers and better deployment.

36:00.042 --> 36:02.206
That's been done in all the major cities.

36:02.226 --> 36:09.477
And the second reason, and a huge reason, is the drug of choice has changed.

36:11.360 --> 36:18.732
In the book I tell about, one of the prisoners tell me about the fact that there were 80,000 poppy growers in Afghanistan

36:19.049 --> 36:22.034
who during the Afghanistan war went to Pakistan.

36:23.055 --> 36:27.723
And then when the, that was in 85, and that's when crack became the drug of choice.

36:29.145 --> 36:31.929
And that's when the drug epidemic, the crack epidemic began.

36:31.969 --> 36:35.615
That's when people were committing crimes of great violence.

36:36.697 --> 36:46.592
Then when the Afghanistan war was over in the early 90s, the poppy growers came back and they started growing poppy.

36:47.618 --> 36:52.084
poppies again, and heroin flooded into this country.

36:52.604 --> 36:54.066
Enormous amounts of heroin.

36:54.847 --> 36:59.633
And in the inner cities today, you don't hear about crack being used that much.

36:59.653 --> 37:02.036
It's been minimized.

37:02.056 --> 37:05.220
Heroin is now being used.

37:05.240 --> 37:07.383
Does this contribute to less violent crime?

37:07.403 --> 37:07.683
Absolutely.

37:07.703 --> 37:07.983
Why?

37:08.344 --> 37:10.486
Because heroin puts people on the nod.

37:11.007 --> 37:13.710
They commit the crimes to get the money to get the heroin.

37:13.991 --> 37:15.853
When they take the heroin, they go to sleep.

37:16.930 --> 37:22.915
When you commit the crime to get the money to buy crack, you take the crack, you go out and break someone's head.

37:23.516 --> 37:28.760
So they say, Jesus, the murder rates in the inner city area has dropped tremendously.

37:28.780 --> 37:32.564
The murder rate has dropped tremendously in the inner cities.

37:33.024 --> 37:33.444
Why?

37:34.445 --> 37:34.826
Why?

37:35.366 --> 37:40.230
Because the inner city kids are not using the crack that they used before.

37:41.211 --> 37:44.934
And it'll probably even diminish more in the months to come.

37:45.395 --> 37:45.655
But

37:46.495 --> 37:48.157
This they told me, and this I believe.

37:48.818 --> 37:56.146
There's another drug coming in from the coast called Crank, which is made with homegrown products.

37:56.166 --> 38:01.872
Sudafed out of the drugstore, and the appetite depressant has a drug called PPM.

38:01.932 --> 38:04.034
Walmart just said you can't buy all this.

38:04.114 --> 38:04.835
Did you see the other thing?

38:04.855 --> 38:05.015
No.

38:05.275 --> 38:09.740
Walmart made a decision that you can no longer buy things like Sudafed in bulk.

38:09.760 --> 38:10.421
Oh, really?

38:10.741 --> 38:11.382
Good for them.

38:11.642 --> 38:12.223
Good for them.

38:12.323 --> 38:14.005
Because it's been demonstrated to them that

38:14.204 --> 38:17.868
These materials are being bought in great volume.

38:17.888 --> 38:21.212
They're being used to manufacture... Crank, which is a methamphetamine.

38:21.412 --> 38:24.055
And crank is coming in again from the West Coast.

38:25.117 --> 38:34.287
When that gets here, which will be the summer after next, you're going to see the crime rate go up again because that's another drug of violence.

38:35.529 --> 38:38.432
So, not a happy prediction.

38:38.692 --> 38:41.916
But the fact is that locking up these...

38:42.284 --> 38:44.949
low-level drug dealers is not working.

38:44.969 --> 38:51.722
The other thing that I found very, very interesting, and this is a revelation to me that I have in the book.

38:51.742 --> 38:53.665
I don't know if it will be to anyone else.

38:54.707 --> 38:55.288
You have time.

38:55.549 --> 38:56.210
I have time.

38:56.250 --> 38:56.471
Good.

38:59.837 --> 39:05.828
The conspiracy laws.

39:07.343 --> 39:13.191
What they try to accomplish, they have these sentencing guidelines which are really draconian.

39:14.073 --> 39:19.540
But what they say is, look, we can't get these kingpins because they don't touch the drugs.

39:19.861 --> 39:21.002
They don't come near the drugs.

39:21.022 --> 39:21.984
They don't sell the drugs.

39:22.064 --> 39:22.905
So how do we get them?

39:23.646 --> 39:27.051
Well, the way we're going to get them is we're going to get the low-level dealer.

39:27.071 --> 39:34.161
And when I say the low-level dealer, we're going to put you away for 10 years under the sentencing guidelines if you're convicted because you had 3 kilos with you.

39:34.563 --> 39:36.827
That's ten years, and that's how long you're going to go away.

39:36.907 --> 39:45.060
But if you give us the name of the kingpin and testify against the kingpin, we'll let you go home.

39:46.782 --> 39:47.864
So the guy says, fine.

39:48.405 --> 39:48.926
And he does it.

39:49.266 --> 39:55.596
And then he gets what they call a K-1 letter, which means you cooperate with the prosecutor and get out of jail free.

39:56.418 --> 39:57.239
Okay?

39:57.259 --> 39:59.122
Now they go after the kingpin.

39:59.142 --> 40:00.985
And they grab the kingpin.

40:01.005 --> 40:02.427
And the kingpin says, please.

40:04.128 --> 40:07.493
I have 50 people working for me.

40:07.513 --> 40:08.755
I'll give you all 50 of them.

40:09.676 --> 40:11.179
Testify against them.

40:11.199 --> 40:12.421
Put them all 50 away.

40:12.761 --> 40:15.325
I want a K-1 letter.

40:15.345 --> 40:16.667
And the prosecutors are giving it to them.

40:17.789 --> 40:18.149
Why?

40:18.590 --> 40:27.283
Because, again, the publicity of arresting 50 members of a drug ring is far better than knocking off one big guy.

40:28.698 --> 40:31.201
So they give the kingpin the K1 letter.

40:31.261 --> 40:33.203
Then they go out and they arrest the 50 guys.

40:33.243 --> 40:34.584
This is what happened with Nicky Barnes.

40:34.604 --> 40:36.366
I don't know if you've ever heard the name Nicky Barnes.

40:36.646 --> 40:39.269
Nicky Barnes was the biggest drug deal in the Northeast.

40:39.289 --> 40:39.830
He's home.

40:40.891 --> 40:41.371
He's home.

40:41.691 --> 40:44.294
But the people that weren't for Nicky Barnes, I was in prison.

40:44.414 --> 40:46.476
One was serving a 70-year sentence.

40:47.558 --> 40:53.023
Because when they get the 50, the 50 say, wait a minute, I'll give up.

40:53.043 --> 40:53.944
I'll tell you who the one is.

40:53.984 --> 40:55.666
We don't need you.

40:55.686 --> 40:56.747
We got everyone.

40:56.913 --> 40:58.095
Yeah, but give me I want a K-1.

40:58.135 --> 40:59.316
You've got nothing.

40:59.356 --> 41:01.158
You're going away for the full time.

41:01.279 --> 41:02.881
I've got a couple of questions.

41:02.901 --> 41:03.301
Sure, I'm sorry.

41:03.341 --> 41:04.623
No, that's fine.

41:04.643 --> 41:06.886
This is all excellent.

41:06.906 --> 41:13.454
I'm going to use general questions, but what was your reputation as a judge?

41:13.474 --> 41:24.548
Were you a hard-ass... No, I was considered a middle-of-the-road judge, but in certain areas I was considered more conservative than other judges.

41:25.209 --> 41:25.890
I was...

41:25.972 --> 41:36.542
very, very tough on violent evidence, very tough, but not, thank goodness, on first-time drug arrests.

41:37.062 --> 41:55.860
I wrote a dissent with respect to the enforcement of the Rockefeller drug laws, although I have to tell you that when Nelson Rockefeller spoke to me about those drug laws back in the 1972

41:56.482 --> 41:58.585
I was very much in favor.

41:58.865 --> 42:01.368
I thought, by God, this will stop it.

42:01.689 --> 42:06.314
You know, an ounce of cocaine, life without parole.

42:06.334 --> 42:07.516
Fantastic idea.

42:07.916 --> 42:12.262
A couple poor people will go away for a long time, but no one's going to touch drugs.

42:12.282 --> 42:15.706
Look at Singapore, you know, the old conventional wisdom.

42:17.008 --> 42:19.231
Well, the Rockefeller drug laws were put in place.

42:19.251 --> 42:22.495
They were modified somewhat, but they're still extraordinary.

42:23.216 --> 42:25.999
And I wrote a dissent saying that they're barbaric.

42:26.435 --> 42:34.225
There was a case that came through our court not too long ago where a young woman, 17 years old, was delivering.

42:34.245 --> 42:34.946
She was a mule.

42:35.446 --> 42:38.750
She was delivering some narcotics to her.

42:39.611 --> 42:49.143
She was delivering it to a narcotics agent, but she got a 15-year mandatory sentence, which she's now served.

42:49.724 --> 42:50.485
No sentence.

42:51.427 --> 43:04.485
Oh, I would be more of an activist judge.

43:04.505 --> 43:19.746
Instead of merely grumbling to my colleagues about the sentencing guidelines and about the conditions in prison with respect to no rehabilitation, no education, no drug treatment, I would be on the stump.

43:20.182 --> 43:26.408
Which I intend to do anyhow, but I would have been far more credible as a judge than as a next con.

43:26.849 --> 43:33.756
So, boy, what a thing do you want to say at one stage when you judge it as opposed to the next con.

43:33.776 --> 43:37.580
You have both of these in your CV now.

43:38.881 --> 43:42.104
I mean, it's an interesting CV, isn't it?

43:42.164 --> 43:44.907
Well, I don't really...

43:45.241 --> 43:49.106
mention that in my CV, because I figured that I would notice it.

43:49.166 --> 43:59.961
Well, I was an activist, and I know I went through an experience with my book, and I won't bore you with it, but I was more offended by randomness, as a matter of fact.

43:59.981 --> 44:03.726
I thought my book would sell, and I spent 60,000 copies in it.

44:03.746 --> 44:14.640
But I went through a year of really very horrible experience of having a contract, and it had been totally digitally contracted, and

44:14.840 --> 44:18.003
Well, that's, you know, this is between you and me.

44:18.063 --> 44:22.568
I, I, I, that's the best thing that ever happened to me.

44:22.588 --> 44:23.469
You got revenge.

44:23.589 --> 44:24.630
That's the best kind of revenge.

44:24.650 --> 44:29.275
Well, this whole publish my book, did it beautifully, and, and, and I'm happy in it.

44:29.315 --> 44:31.217
Oh, it's a highly thought-up book.

44:31.317 --> 44:32.178
It is.

44:32.218 --> 44:32.398
Yeah.

44:32.499 --> 44:34.561
And it was under contract with him.

44:35.041 --> 44:37.824
But, but, the reason I bring this up is a very good point of mind.

44:37.904 --> 44:44.291
Another writer said, you know, Nick, he said, I think through all this, it really helps build your character, in a way.

44:44.311 --> 44:44.391
And,

44:44.624 --> 44:55.196
It does give you, and I wonder if, in a way, this experience for you helped you.

44:55.216 --> 44:57.398
It certainly gave you an outlook.

44:58.300 --> 45:13.737
No, it certainly gave me another... You were no longer living this privileged... But it also, there's also out there an awful lot of people who I victimized.

45:14.020 --> 45:25.230
And I'm not only talking about the victim of a crime, I'm talking about my family, I'm talking about my friends, I'm talking about my court and my profession.

45:25.250 --> 45:33.077
And there's a lot of resentment out there for that, I'm sure.

45:33.097 --> 45:40.524
And I was always, I always prided myself on a good name and a good reputation.

45:40.544 --> 45:41.665
That's been destroyed.

45:41.999 --> 45:46.325
I used to say to my kids, you know, oh, well, you know.

45:46.706 --> 45:48.488
You may be, you know.

45:48.649 --> 45:49.891
A felon.

45:49.911 --> 45:57.201
Correct me if I'm wrong, but you're probably the only prisoner in the history of the public who was visited by a justice in the Supreme Court.

45:57.221 --> 45:57.742
Yeah.

45:57.762 --> 45:59.545
And, you know, is there another case?

45:59.645 --> 46:08.698
In the New York Times book review this week, which I saw, um,

46:09.067 --> 46:11.270
criticizes me for telling that story.

46:11.751 --> 46:12.432
Why?

46:12.452 --> 46:15.457
Because they said I was name dropping.

46:15.637 --> 46:18.462
Yeah, I know.

46:18.662 --> 46:24.090
And I was trying to make... That's one of the most dramatic moments in the... I would have led with that.

46:24.110 --> 46:32.003
I gotta tell you, that... You know, I can't think about that without getting very emotional.

46:32.023 --> 46:33.565
That to me is the most dramatic moment.

46:33.585 --> 46:35.428
Not the arrest, not anything else.

46:36.033 --> 46:55.952
To me, as a writer, if I were writing this book, I probably would have led with that.

46:55.972 --> 46:56.873
You talk about, you know, my God, where am I?

46:56.893 --> 46:59.655
What's happened to my life?

46:59.675 --> 47:00.676
You talk about Franz Kafka looking at this script.

47:00.696 --> 47:01.717
That wouldn't even be the way I write it, isn't it?

47:01.737 --> 47:02.218
You're absolutely right.

47:02.238 --> 47:03.559
This was such a crushing thing, such an emotional thing that

47:04.180 --> 47:17.621
I was before a large audience, and they were asking me about people who visited me in prison.

47:17.641 --> 47:23.470
And I started telling that story, and I started to weep like a baby.

47:23.810 --> 47:30.340
Just thinking about that moment was just... Anyway...

47:30.725 --> 47:32.830
Why would the Times criticize that?

47:33.431 --> 47:37.199
This article is very, very critical.

47:37.219 --> 47:40.506
First of all... This is this coming Sunday?

47:40.527 --> 47:46.219
Yeah, he starts off by saying that he doesn't think it was written in prison.

47:46.638 --> 47:51.643
Well, I think you say at the beginning that you've edited it.

47:52.204 --> 47:52.684
I did.

47:52.704 --> 47:53.505
I did.

47:53.966 --> 47:55.768
But you know, it was remarkable.

47:55.808 --> 47:59.832
When they were doing this Dateline show, they asked if they could see the actual journal.

48:00.232 --> 48:03.315
And so I brought out all the letters I'd sent to my daughter.

48:03.335 --> 48:05.398
And I started reading them with this producer.

48:05.978 --> 48:10.042
And by God, there was a lot of stuff that was just absolutely right from there to here.

48:11.244 --> 48:12.625
You can't remember these things.

48:12.685 --> 48:13.506
No, of course not.

48:13.672 --> 48:16.374
I wish I'd kept a diary when I was in the Navy.

48:16.495 --> 48:17.395
Oh, absolutely.

48:17.475 --> 48:19.958
Stuff that's gone forever.

48:19.978 --> 48:20.498
That's right.

48:20.858 --> 48:39.535
For instance, when I read, when I was reading the galleys on the solitary confinement thing, if you put bamboo splints under my fingernails to recall anything that happened to me in solitary confinement, I couldn't do it.

48:39.575 --> 48:41.417
The human mind is wonderful, and

48:41.566 --> 48:44.191
blocking out those kind of unpleasantries.

48:45.914 --> 48:47.497
But I didn't remember anything.

48:48.379 --> 48:58.037
Even as I sit here now, it would be difficult for me to recall, having just read it, recall things that happened to me during those 30 days in the last time.

48:58.117 --> 48:58.798
Because it's just

48:59.605 --> 49:00.426
You just lose it.

49:00.566 --> 49:03.410
So tell me, what do you see in your future?

49:03.430 --> 49:04.171
Well, I have a job.

49:04.191 --> 49:09.939
I finally got a job teaching law at a law school down in Long Island.

49:09.999 --> 49:11.201
That's called Turo.

49:11.221 --> 49:11.701
Good for them.

49:11.921 --> 49:14.705
They took some balls, if you'll excuse my grief.

49:14.725 --> 49:26.541
Well, I tell the story in my epilogue about my one experience where they wanted me to teach and I taught and then they asked me to leave and then

49:26.723 --> 49:33.573
I don't tell a story about another law school where the dean called me up and asked if I would teach, and I told him I would be delighted.

49:33.593 --> 49:44.189
He said, but first I wanted to share it with the faculty, and they had me meet with the faculty, and the faculty signed off on it, and everything was all set.

49:45.551 --> 49:54.064
They had prepared a syllabus, and I was to start in September, and in the middle of August,

49:54.736 --> 50:02.687
I get a call from the board of trustees of the law school who didn't want me to come to work.

50:02.707 --> 50:04.209
And I can understand that, you know.

50:04.229 --> 50:06.993
As you say, it takes balls.

50:07.013 --> 50:12.040
But this law school, I was just—it sat on a student petition.

50:12.741 --> 50:20.271
I spoke at the law school, and the students circulate a petition and present it to the dean.

50:21.061 --> 50:24.926
faculty, and they signed off on it, and the Board of Trustees did.

50:25.587 --> 50:26.508
So what did you be teaching?

50:27.149 --> 50:28.350
Appellate Advocacy.

50:28.411 --> 50:29.372
I want to start with that.

50:29.892 --> 50:37.102
I told them I wanted only 20 students in the class to make it a seminar, and they had 175 sign up for it.

50:37.803 --> 50:44.091
So I agreed to expand it to 25, but it can't be any more, you know, just seniors.

50:44.451 --> 50:49.498
Yeah, but it's just going to be the senior law students, just to

50:50.542 --> 50:54.947
That'll be good.

50:54.968 --> 50:56.349
And this book is closure.

50:56.750 --> 50:58.312
This puts that behind me.

50:58.332 --> 51:03.859
But I intend to work very, very hard and speak on the issues.

51:03.879 --> 51:06.222
So the book is closure for you?

51:06.242 --> 51:06.342
Yeah.

51:06.362 --> 51:07.864
Is it a catharsis for you?

51:07.884 --> 51:10.967
Does the book perform that function for you?

51:10.987 --> 51:14.252
Yeah, because I think I said what I wanted to say.

51:15.033 --> 51:17.055
I think I made the points I wanted to make.

51:17.474 --> 51:22.209
and it gives me a platform for which to speak.

51:23.052 --> 51:25.459
If people would listen to me,

51:26.080 --> 51:29.684
which some do, on national public radio, they would be fabulous.

51:30.285 --> 51:38.074
But when it comes to Larry King, tell me, if Joyce Sullivan was here now, what would you say to her?

51:38.314 --> 51:39.676
And what would she say to you?

51:40.737 --> 51:43.260
And I kept saying, we would have nothing to say to her.

51:43.280 --> 51:45.642
Well, you know, didn't you ever fail?

51:45.662 --> 51:50.108
Yeah, because all of Joyce Sullivan was here now, and it's all over, and maybe we'll go out on a date.

51:50.148 --> 51:50.928
That's embarrassing.

51:50.949 --> 51:53.451
That embarrasses me just to hear it.

51:53.471 --> 51:54.012
Just hopeful.

51:53.992 --> 51:57.435
So, you know, that's the unwelcome stuff.

51:58.296 --> 52:02.360
Do you still have a deep abiding faith in the system?

52:02.380 --> 52:02.840
Oh, yes.

52:03.400 --> 52:03.801
Oh, yes.

52:03.921 --> 52:06.283
The system really, did the system screw up in your case?

52:06.303 --> 52:07.004
No, no.

52:07.084 --> 52:18.334
I think I have a great, but the system has to be fine-tuned when it comes to certain things and certainly has to be completely changed when it comes to mandatory sentences.

52:18.354 --> 52:21.477
This is the 10th anniversary of the federal guidelines.

52:21.497 --> 52:22.918
Nine out of every 10

52:23.236 --> 52:29.866
Federal judges say that it brings injustice to our justice system.

52:29.886 --> 52:30.486
Injustice.

52:30.506 --> 52:31.087
Injustice.

52:31.268 --> 52:33.411
You cannot have the legislature.

52:33.931 --> 52:36.515
Nine out of every ten federal judges.

52:37.056 --> 52:44.046
You can't have the legislature in the states and in the federal government, Congress,

52:44.363 --> 52:46.186
deciding how people should be sentenced.

52:46.386 --> 52:49.051
And of course, it's all reflecting political attitudes.

52:49.071 --> 52:49.572
Absolutely.

52:49.712 --> 52:51.715
The recurrence of opinion.

52:51.775 --> 52:52.496
Yeah, exactly.

52:52.516 --> 52:58.006
It's like looking at the polls and saying, hey, if we really strengthen the law against... Right, right.

52:58.026 --> 52:59.167
Sent away for 20 years.

53:00.069 --> 53:05.578
Can you imagine some politician getting up saying, I think that we should reduce...

53:05.879 --> 53:09.484
the amount of time a person serves for a first-time drug possession?

53:10.546 --> 53:13.029
Cut it down from 10 to 5 years?

53:13.249 --> 53:15.833
Well, Louis Lent got sentenced today.

53:15.893 --> 53:17.175
I just turned it on the way in.

53:17.195 --> 53:19.959
You know, the fellow who killed the woman girl, Sarah Edwards.

53:20.119 --> 53:25.947
And the judge in New York said, I wish I had the death penalty at my disposal.

53:25.967 --> 53:26.428
And I don't.

53:26.788 --> 53:29.192
So he gave the 25 to life.

53:29.532 --> 53:31.395
But first he serves time here.

53:32.516 --> 53:33.658
You know, uh...

53:33.993 --> 53:36.617
I don't think you're suggesting discretion.

53:36.637 --> 53:49.956
I mean, I think the judge quite correctly gave the maximum... I think a judge should be given discretion to go very, very high because you always have an appellate corner that's excessive to cut it down.

53:50.878 --> 53:59.650
But I don't think that a judge has to be... For example, two fellows have a barroom board.

53:59.670 --> 54:02.194
The one left standing, the winner...

54:02.815 --> 54:04.177
is arrested for assault.

54:05.478 --> 54:09.182
Another fellow goes out and jumps on a poor old lady and beats the hell out of her.

54:10.263 --> 54:12.506
He's arrested for assault.

54:12.526 --> 54:14.548
Same crime, same punishment.

54:15.830 --> 54:21.916
A woman... And this guy might have even been, you know, the other guy, the guy that's down might have started the fight.

54:21.997 --> 54:23.038
That's right, absolutely.

54:23.078 --> 54:24.639
This guy might have been defending himself.

54:24.820 --> 54:26.341
Absolutely, absolutely.

54:26.361 --> 54:28.264
But because he won the fight, he's guilty himself.

54:28.284 --> 54:31.367
And that's why I'm against the mandatory three strikes you're out rule.

54:31.707 --> 54:32.248
Because...

54:32.650 --> 54:35.694
because a judge should be able to look behind the fact.

54:35.795 --> 54:39.240
Now, you've convicted that fellow standing in the barroom brawl.

54:39.440 --> 54:42.264
You've convicted him, and it turns out he had two other felonies.

54:42.324 --> 54:50.176
He had a shop, he stole from someone, and he stole a car or something.

54:50.436 --> 54:52.599
And now there's this third felony, life in prison.

54:53.220 --> 54:53.781
Well, you know...

54:54.335 --> 54:55.296
He's a bad guy.

54:55.716 --> 54:57.138
He shouldn't have been in that bar.

54:57.158 --> 54:58.079
But he didn't start it.

54:58.379 --> 55:00.061
So you want to put him away for five years?

55:00.361 --> 55:01.583
What's the word they use?

55:01.603 --> 55:04.045
Men's rea?

55:04.065 --> 55:04.646
Intent?

55:04.726 --> 55:08.210
Intent.

55:08.310 --> 55:11.433
It's a common word that's used.

55:16.999 --> 55:19.482
But you know, just assuming the crimes.

55:19.951 --> 55:21.633
A woman steals powdered milk.

55:21.974 --> 55:22.635
Oh, sure.

55:23.216 --> 55:27.802
A woman steals powdered milk to feed her baby.

55:28.363 --> 55:34.852
Another fellow steals powdered milk to cut heroin.

55:35.833 --> 55:38.858
Same substance, same crime, same punishment.

55:38.878 --> 55:49.873
A judge has to go in there and say, the legislature says that stealing a substance is punishable by X. Therefore, I have to give you X.

55:50.748 --> 55:52.770
So we need a little bit of discretion here.

55:52.790 --> 55:54.031
Exactly, exactly.

55:54.051 --> 55:56.874
And common sense, I think, too.

55:56.894 --> 55:57.794
Let me give you my pen.

55:57.975 --> 56:00.817
Wait, if I can't have the jacket on.

56:00.837 --> 56:01.258
Is this right?

56:01.738 --> 56:02.459
Yeah.

56:02.479 --> 56:02.819
Sorry.

56:03.259 --> 56:06.022
Let me give you a decent pen.

56:06.482 --> 56:15.170
I'm the collector here, you know.

56:15.190 --> 56:15.370
Oh, yeah.

56:15.390 --> 56:15.751
Oh, thank you.

56:15.771 --> 56:19.954
I'm just saying some books down in Washington.

56:19.975 --> 56:20.535
You don't seem to

56:21.241 --> 56:37.379
My brother used to tell me, my older brother when I was growing up, that anyone who seeks revenge has to dig two graves and that you can't do that.

56:37.600 --> 56:40.423
You've got to leave those things behind you.

56:40.683 --> 56:45.088
You can't have any bitterness or grudges or anything else.

56:45.558 --> 56:47.001
Go ahead and look forward.

56:47.021 --> 56:50.988
Yeah, and one of the things I get out of your book is, I mean, two things.

56:51.049 --> 56:55.557
First of all, yes, you are for certain forms of sentencing.

56:55.577 --> 57:02.110
I don't think you're looking for any kind of wholesale prison reform on the one hand, but on the other, you take full responsibility for your actions.

57:02.350 --> 57:02.931
Absolutely.

57:02.951 --> 57:05.075
You're not blaming anybody else.

57:05.156 --> 57:08.562
No, and nor should I, because

57:08.913 --> 57:11.156
And I think that's very important to point out.

57:12.417 --> 57:13.118
You did what you did.

57:13.138 --> 57:16.141
I'm also not going to keep the proceeds from this book.

57:16.161 --> 57:17.082
I didn't know that.

57:17.583 --> 57:18.023
Yeah.

57:18.183 --> 57:26.833
I've started an organization called CADRE, I mentioned it in the episode, which is an alternative dispute resolution.

57:26.853 --> 57:29.876
And all the profits go to provide legal services for the poor.

57:30.397 --> 57:37.485
And all the proceeds from this book go into the CADRE operation so that it can be

57:37.769 --> 57:39.794
Go bigger and better and more productive.

57:39.814 --> 57:43.985
Do you plan any more books?

57:44.005 --> 57:47.073
Yes, I'll tell you all the rest.

57:47.373 --> 57:48.015
I started it.
