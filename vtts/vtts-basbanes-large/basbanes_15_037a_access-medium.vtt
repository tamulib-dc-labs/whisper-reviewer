WEBVTT

00:01.921 --> 00:06.507
Well, I do want to say, sir, it's a great personal pleasure.

00:06.867 --> 00:07.368
Thank you.

00:08.829 --> 00:13.175
I would liken it to my leading Ted Williams.

00:13.735 --> 00:14.096
Yeah.

00:14.116 --> 00:16.178
When I was a kid.

00:16.198 --> 00:17.200
You're a coffee drinker.

00:17.420 --> 00:27.132
I'm a coffee drinker, a lover of aviation, and spent three years on an aircraft carrier in the Western Pacific.

00:28.513 --> 00:31.557
I've always known about you and your great triumphs.

00:36.110 --> 00:49.424
I guess what really interests me is the perception, and a very valid and genuine perception of you as a modern hero, a hero for the 1980s.

00:50.185 --> 00:55.971
I know this from the many stories I've read about you in this book, but it kind of embarrasses you a little better.

00:56.992 --> 01:00.416
Yeah, you'd probably get some argument out of that from me.

01:00.436 --> 01:03.079
But do you think that perhaps

01:03.346 --> 01:06.230
I wonder if you could have been a hero in the 60s.

01:06.250 --> 01:11.498
There was so much talk that there were no more American heroes, and all of a sudden we have one with Chuck.

01:11.518 --> 01:15.383
Well, if I'm a hero today, I was a hero in the 60s, too.

01:16.165 --> 01:17.226
Well, perception, though.

01:17.286 --> 01:20.831
I mean, you think that your book is number one immediately.

01:21.212 --> 01:22.614
Knocked off the Iacocca.

01:22.934 --> 01:26.480
I'm going to suggest to Stu Applemore that they've got a presidential ticket there.

01:27.962 --> 01:29.604
Iacocca and Yeager.

01:30.806 --> 01:30.906
Sure.

01:31.190 --> 01:38.057
Well, I don't think—I'd do the Ishi Delco commercials, and that would tickle me to bump him off being a Ford Weenie, so.

01:40.699 --> 01:42.100
How do you feel about that?

01:42.120 --> 01:47.285
Do you think that the times are light?

01:47.545 --> 01:48.166
I think so.

01:48.266 --> 02:00.758
It's just—I don't have that broad enough knowledge, Nick, to know whether—if I'd have published a book in the sixties, it would have done what it's doing today.

02:00.940 --> 02:30.728
I personally, well, I would guess that it would not have, because the people today are much, much better educated than they were in the 60s, and the so-called, you know, anti-war demonstrators, draft card burners, and the Jane Fonders, and traitors like that, in my opinion, were very poorly educated, to choice or not, to the point where they

02:31.417 --> 02:45.971
They blamed the military for Vietnam, but now people are suddenly realizing and said, hell, you know, guys that were fighting in Vietnam weren't over there because they wanted to be, because they were over there because their country asked them to go.

02:46.872 --> 02:51.636
And the people today are well aware that, you know, military doesn't make foreign policy.

02:52.797 --> 03:00.124
In fact, that's my analogy, that's what I see happening today, and that's the reason for the big

03:00.543 --> 03:06.251
I would say not sympathy, but agreement with the guys who were in Vietnam.

03:06.291 --> 03:08.954
They say, hey, you in Vietnam, you did a good job.

03:09.054 --> 03:11.378
You weren't the cause of Vietnam.

03:11.418 --> 03:14.822
You were fighting there because you were fighting for your country.

03:14.882 --> 03:17.025
I think it goes beyond that, though.

03:17.065 --> 03:21.972
I mean, I don't want to push this too far, but I mean, you're a hero.

03:22.052 --> 03:25.757
You are a modern hero of the 1980s.

03:26.125 --> 03:32.592
The great exploits, the great achievements triumphs sort of in the forties and the fifties and you're being recognized.

03:32.632 --> 03:38.238
Isn't that kind of ironic that you're being recognized or not recognized but accepted now by the great people?

03:38.258 --> 03:42.663
Well, I'm being accepted by a different kind of people.

03:43.684 --> 03:51.492
In the fifties, forties, fifties, sixties and seventies I was still a hero to Air Force guys, you know pilots primarily.

03:51.893 --> 03:53.335
Anybody in the Air Force.

03:53.635 --> 04:02.788
Today, I'm probably, if I am a hero, I'm a hero to a housewife who has a son who she'd like to see do or have the attitude that I have.

04:03.389 --> 04:06.753
How do you feel, we'll get out this here a little bit.

04:07.314 --> 04:08.996
There's a space shuttle up there now.

04:09.016 --> 04:10.779
There's a 58-year-old man on board.

04:11.620 --> 04:13.022
Would you like to be up there?

04:13.062 --> 04:14.063
If I could fly it, I would.

04:15.505 --> 04:16.146
Do you think that's

04:18.674 --> 04:19.315
them the cars?

04:19.335 --> 04:20.256
It'd be a waste of money.

04:20.276 --> 04:25.143
Train me to make one flight on a space shuttle and then, you know— Well, they sent him teachers.

04:26.024 --> 04:33.394
It's a big difference flying it than riding in the back with a mission specialist barking in their beards, you know.

04:33.414 --> 04:38.741
Do you think that this would be sufficiently challenging to you, or do you think it's pretty routine the way they've got it?

04:38.761 --> 04:46.251
It's pretty routine now, meaning that I fly systems today in the F-20 that are as

04:46.822 --> 04:55.853
It's not a space vehicle, but it's the same computer technology that's in the computer flight control system that's in the shuttle, but even more advanced.

04:55.873 --> 04:57.615
You would like that aircraft, the F-20.

04:57.815 --> 04:59.277
Yeah, well, it's an advanced aircraft.

04:59.297 --> 05:00.178
It's a new airplane.

05:00.198 --> 05:01.360
It's modern technology.

05:01.380 --> 05:04.243
Isn't this the one that the Air Force won't buy?

05:04.584 --> 05:11.352
Well, the Air Force has got a large amount of its money tied up in the logistics space for the F-16.

05:11.512 --> 05:13.875
They can't afford to buy a new airplane right now.

05:14.513 --> 05:16.878
So that's one that they'd love to have, the F-20.

05:17.239 --> 05:21.087
But this is when it was entirely built and designed by private enterprise.

05:21.107 --> 05:22.350
Yeah, there's no military money in it.

05:22.370 --> 05:30.126
It's a beautiful thing to see how Northup built and how they handled, and it shook a lot of people up when Northup came to

05:31.000 --> 05:39.773
With this unsolicited proposal to the Air Force, we'll sell you 300 and so many airplanes for a fixed price and guarantee the cost of the spares for the next 20 years.

05:39.913 --> 05:41.596
Unprecedented, isn't it?

05:41.616 --> 05:42.317
That's right.

05:42.397 --> 05:46.543
And the one thing, even if they never sell an F-20, they have done their job.

05:46.583 --> 05:50.910
What they've got, the cost of F-16s are all on the way down.

05:50.930 --> 05:54.455
So it's embarrassing to GD and the Air Force.

05:54.475 --> 05:55.557
I'll ask you a question about it.

06:00.532 --> 06:14.350
There are several instances and experiences where you drew on a sixth sense in the plummeting of the X-1A, helping your buddy save that P-51 that was going to be the rest of the next day.

06:15.731 --> 06:17.674
Tell me about the sixth sense.

06:18.715 --> 06:23.221
Well, I don't think it's a sixth sense, Nick.

06:23.261 --> 06:28.868
I think it is intimate knowledge about the systems in an airplane.

06:29.692 --> 06:34.118
You have to go back, like in the beginning of the book, my dad raised me.

06:34.178 --> 06:41.088
I was raised around, not only because my dad raised me did I know him again.

06:41.108 --> 06:57.471
The vocational schools to us kids back in the, you know, the 30s, I spent lots of nights in garages with instructors teaching me how to take an engine apart, put it together, get it, repair it, and, you know,

06:57.907 --> 06:58.868
repair a tractor.

06:59.028 --> 07:08.058
I had fifty hours, as I recall, of the settling and arc welding in those locational schools because it was one of the things— That's kind of quicker than that.

07:08.318 --> 07:21.133
Well, and when I'm in the cockpit with you and that X-ray is plummeting 51,000 feet in 51 seconds and all of a sudden there's something in there that says, hey, the stabilizing element is the leading edge.

07:21.333 --> 07:24.076
That comes from experience.

07:24.416 --> 07:27.019
Yeah, you remember I made a statement.

07:27.269 --> 07:29.011
fun every airplane in the world.

07:29.091 --> 07:30.593
It's part of your instruction.

07:30.873 --> 07:32.595
You're taught that in test ball school.

07:32.976 --> 07:34.477
And I'd run a lot of spin programs.

07:35.098 --> 07:36.900
Spinning airplanes was second nature to me.

07:37.501 --> 07:40.444
Same way I had—my pressure suit was inflated.

07:40.544 --> 07:42.126
I had enough sense to know it.

07:42.186 --> 07:45.029
I knew I was in trouble.

07:45.069 --> 07:48.013
But the thing that worried me is I thought I'd lost the tail off the airplane.

07:48.033 --> 07:49.555
I didn't have any way of getting out of it.

07:50.756 --> 07:53.479
But there again, you just concede the fact and say,

07:53.999 --> 07:55.241
That's the way it goes.

07:55.261 --> 08:00.508
Apparently you, from time to time, listen to the tape.

08:00.608 --> 08:02.611
Well, yeah.

08:02.631 --> 08:04.814
What does that do when you hear that?

08:04.834 --> 08:06.056
Why do you listen to the tape?

08:06.236 --> 08:11.764
You know, the one thing that I hear in that tape is one word, hit.

08:13.907 --> 08:19.494
I remember it reverted me back when I was in a semi-conscious state.

08:20.356 --> 08:23.500
Hit was a word that we used for IT.

08:24.745 --> 08:31.199
And I remember the question was asking me, did your suit inflate?

08:31.219 --> 08:33.304
Yes, it did.

08:33.424 --> 08:35.308
That word comes through loud and clear.

08:35.870 --> 08:41.382
You say, and it means that I went back, you know, I wasn't thinking, I couldn't, didn't have enough sense to think.

08:42.584 --> 08:43.767
Well, you clearly had enough sense.

08:48.505 --> 08:50.728
that could have escaped during that.

08:50.888 --> 08:51.709
I didn't have to think.

08:51.769 --> 08:55.874
It was instinct, you know, because based on all experience I'd had up until then.

08:57.216 --> 08:59.098
How about luck, luck and skill?

08:59.118 --> 09:01.261
Tell me the difference between the two.

09:01.341 --> 09:09.611
I mean, would you ascribe many of your great escapes to luck, or let's come down to what we call it skill?

09:09.631 --> 09:18.141
Well, a lot of people say you make your own luck, and the phrase luck, you know, using that word when you describe

09:18.745 --> 09:27.436
You know, coming out of an incident or a bad situation, there's a gray area between luck and skill.

09:28.657 --> 09:31.581
And luck overlaps and skill overlaps.

09:31.601 --> 09:38.990
And probably in my case, the overlapping is probably a little wider than in a lot of other people's lives.

09:39.491 --> 09:42.394
But you can't arm luck out.

09:43.776 --> 09:45.318
You're quite frank in the book.

09:45.338 --> 09:47.200
You say you're terrified.

09:47.838 --> 09:48.719
Yeah.

09:48.859 --> 09:56.328
Anybody would be, but the point is, we're terrified in combat.

09:56.769 --> 10:03.277
But you learn real quick that if you let that worry, it'll kill you quicker than a bullet would.

10:03.297 --> 10:05.640
Is there a difference between terror and fear?

10:06.421 --> 10:06.781
No.

10:06.801 --> 10:07.602
You were terrified.

10:07.642 --> 10:12.208
Nah, to me it's all one.

10:13.825 --> 10:15.648
You're afraid of the outcome.

10:15.728 --> 10:20.556
You may have fear of getting on a mic in front of a thousand people.

10:20.576 --> 10:25.463
Somebody else may have terror, you know, getting, say, I'm going to take this car for 200 miles an hour.

10:26.004 --> 10:30.632
And as you go through about 100 and 150, you begin to, you know, get scared.

10:32.935 --> 10:40.407
Terror, like we use the word terror like, let's say, well, flying.

10:41.315 --> 10:49.527
on an hour's mission is fifty-five minutes of pleasure for five minutes of stark terror on landing.

10:49.547 --> 10:54.114
You could use that expression, meaning, Christ, what a horrible place to be.

10:55.156 --> 11:05.331
No, there's no— Have you kept a log of how many hours— Oh, sure, the Air Force has, you form five flight records, tells exactly every airplane you ever flew when.

11:05.598 --> 11:07.260
the total time, where you were.

11:07.861 --> 11:10.024
So what are your hours now?

11:10.224 --> 11:20.479
I run right now about eleven thousand six hundred hours, of which somewhere around ten and a half are in fighters.

11:21.520 --> 11:26.587
That was the day I retired eleven years ago—or ten years ago.

11:27.549 --> 11:35.520
And since then I've put in about, oh, close to five hundred hours in

11:36.091 --> 11:42.038
in fighters and maybe about 4,000 hours in civilian airplanes.

11:42.058 --> 11:47.484
You make a very interesting point that there's no such thing as a natural aviator.

11:48.005 --> 11:49.807
Maybe you could explain a little bit.

11:50.368 --> 11:56.215
I think people would say that Chuck Yeager is the most natural pilot who's ever lived.

11:56.275 --> 12:03.263
Had I been a natural pilot, the day that I strapped my tail in an airplane for the first time, I could have flown it.

12:04.525 --> 12:06.147
An airplane is a piece of machinery.

12:07.729 --> 12:31.697
And you and I and Joe and all of us have—if you give us the same baseline of visual acuity, meaning the same eyes, the same coordination, and the same stamina, we, as we go through our flying experience, the guy that has the most experience is going to be the best.

12:32.808 --> 12:36.212
Well, now, there's an interesting episode towards the end of the book.

12:36.232 --> 12:37.915
You're preaching to the Pope here now.

12:38.676 --> 12:42.000
Yeah.

12:42.060 --> 12:48.288
But there's an interesting episode at the end of the book where you just did everything to this meek.

12:48.308 --> 12:48.609
Yeah.

12:48.869 --> 12:53.835
And this other guy was basically challenging you the same way that I... Yeah.

12:53.916 --> 12:58.321
You know, he took up the meek and you waxed his teeth.

12:58.341 --> 12:58.802
Yeah.

12:58.822 --> 13:00.184
Was that fun?

13:00.264 --> 13:01.285
Did you enjoy that?

13:01.866 --> 13:02.747
Yeah, because he...

13:03.014 --> 13:07.499
I have one advantage that that lieutenant colonel never had.

13:08.540 --> 13:11.924
I lived and breathed dogfighting in World War II.

13:11.944 --> 13:13.485
He had never been in World War II.

13:13.505 --> 13:17.049
In fact, I doubt if he ever flew a prop airplane.

13:17.069 --> 13:18.310
See, that's what I mean.

13:18.370 --> 13:25.498
Formation flying, hell, half of my life has been on a wing in weather or something because I'm a fighter pilot.

13:26.499 --> 13:32.025
You point out that that's the greatest experience, the greatest satisfaction is dogfighting.

13:33.001 --> 13:40.251
Dog, well, combat is the ultimate.

13:40.371 --> 13:41.973
Is that because your ass is on the line?

13:42.113 --> 13:44.256
That's exactly right and that's why you're trained.

13:44.276 --> 13:45.118
That's why you're paid.

13:45.418 --> 13:47.160
That's why you wear a uniform, to fight.

13:47.180 --> 13:50.885
I don't care where you are or what you're doing.

13:50.905 --> 13:52.247
That's what they pay you for.

13:52.267 --> 13:57.895
I'm sure that you get a lot of questions and you address it in the book.

14:06.751 --> 14:09.033
and you're going to kill him.

14:09.453 --> 14:11.375
He's out to get you, you're out to get him.

14:12.196 --> 14:14.978
You're out close too.

14:14.998 --> 14:18.081
Combat, man, if you don't get him, he's going to get you.

14:19.302 --> 14:21.724
And there's a challenge there, isn't there?

14:21.744 --> 14:24.487
Damn right there.

14:24.507 --> 14:28.110
Kind of an incentive, you know, to do your best.

14:28.230 --> 14:31.513
And don't screw up.

14:31.813 --> 14:34.355
That may be your last one.

14:34.395 --> 14:35.717
Are you superstitious at all?

14:35.837 --> 14:36.117
No.

14:36.890 --> 14:39.553
No, I walk under the ladders.

14:40.134 --> 14:45.621
You know, to me, that's the one thing, I suppose, odds.

14:46.242 --> 14:47.464
That's a good example.

14:47.624 --> 14:58.698
You say, all right, if I draw—if I have a deck of cards and I draw eleven black ones, my chances of drawing a red one, man, are really great.

14:58.718 --> 15:00.200
I don't look that way.

15:00.220 --> 15:01.361
Every one's a new shot.

15:01.822 --> 15:02.723
Every one's a new shot.

15:04.245 --> 15:05.867
That's the reason I disagreed with—

15:06.320 --> 15:21.398
The Air Force, when they said, you know, I crashed, I had the accident in the XF-92, the X-1A, Tumble, you know, doing research flying, and they said, there's a lot of the average going to get to one of these.

15:21.418 --> 15:22.679
I've got just a good chance.

15:23.340 --> 15:26.363
Next flight, next airplane, I've got an even chance.

15:26.484 --> 15:28.806
Better chance, because you've got that much more experience.

15:28.906 --> 15:29.387
That's right.

15:30.088 --> 15:31.990
And that's one thing, Nick, it comes up.

15:33.573 --> 15:44.403
I was on a TV show this morning with old Buzz, what's that black guy?

15:44.984 --> 15:49.068
He's really a fun guy to come around with.

15:51.190 --> 15:52.451
That brings up one thing.

15:54.433 --> 16:03.141
Many people ask me, how do you consider your education?

16:03.492 --> 16:04.454
You never had a degree.

16:05.796 --> 16:15.150
When I came back to the war, the Air Force had, you know, programs they would have sent me to college for two years, got a degree.

16:15.771 --> 16:31.035
And as time went on, I began to realize that suppose I had going to college, let's see, after the X-1, between the X-1 and the X-1A, spent two years in school, not flying.

16:31.825 --> 16:35.309
Okay, then I came back and got the X-1 program.

16:35.329 --> 16:37.451
Do I think I would have lived through the X-1?

16:37.591 --> 16:38.492
I don't think I would have.

16:39.894 --> 16:56.451
Because the deterioration of my flying skills and experience over that period of time, there was times like in the NF-104, when I think I really cut it close to a very fine edge.

16:57.072 --> 17:01.056
And had I had maybe one hour less experience flying,

17:01.407 --> 17:04.311
I would have gotten killed.

17:04.331 --> 17:05.533
What did that one always give you?

17:07.455 --> 17:09.018
Knowledge and experience.

17:09.178 --> 17:09.779
Experience.

17:09.959 --> 17:11.060
Well, there's no way or sense.

17:11.141 --> 17:12.623
It gave me experience.

17:13.684 --> 17:25.140
It gave me the capability and also the knowledge and pressure suits and the systems that I was operating that gave me a subconscious capability to do the right thing.

17:27.423 --> 17:27.904
It's...

17:39.663 --> 17:41.245
things.

17:41.265 --> 17:45.231
I guess aircraft is important to have not only a total amount of hours— Yeah, but tight.

17:45.271 --> 17:46.553
Isn't that tight?

17:47.174 --> 17:48.235
You love that airplane.

17:48.436 --> 17:48.696
Right.

17:48.776 --> 17:49.738
It's the greatest property.

17:49.798 --> 17:52.101
I was flying one three days ago in Oshkosh.

17:52.121 --> 17:52.662
Isn't that right?

17:53.042 --> 17:55.886
You should have seen Good Morning America this morning.

17:56.267 --> 17:57.469
Oh, shit.

17:57.489 --> 17:58.270
You were on this one?

17:58.290 --> 17:58.851
Oh, shit.

17:58.871 --> 17:59.892
Six-minute segment.

18:00.253 --> 18:03.257
And the thing is, I'm flying a Mustang at Oshkosh, and

18:03.558 --> 18:09.887
And I don't know, I was on David Hartman's show in June, and he made me promise he might give him a ride in a Mustang.

18:09.907 --> 18:11.889
This is how I closed out the show this morning.

18:11.909 --> 18:13.071
It really worked good.

18:13.892 --> 18:17.457
I'm sitting up in the cockpit of this Mustang.

18:17.838 --> 18:19.680
I said, well, there you have it.

18:19.740 --> 18:21.463
Oshkosh, the greatest air show in the world.

18:21.523 --> 18:24.947
I've been showing airplanes and aerobatics and ultra lights and everything.

18:25.508 --> 18:32.077
And David, oh, by the way, David, you asked me to take you for a flight in the Mustang when I was on your show the last time.

18:32.478 --> 18:32.738
Well...

18:33.106 --> 18:36.630
I'm here at Oshkosh and I got a Mustang and you ain't here so I'm going flying.

18:37.010 --> 18:41.596
I get in the airplane, start the engine, and I lay down and I said, you probably got sick anyway.

18:42.316 --> 18:43.658
Was that on to you?

18:43.718 --> 18:45.580
Yeah, just exactly the way I'm telling you.

18:45.600 --> 18:46.962
It really turned out good.

18:47.162 --> 18:48.864
God damn Hartman, he's going to kill me.

18:49.264 --> 18:53.809
You still got a kick out of it.

18:53.829 --> 18:56.953
Oh yeah, and I thought to myself, how lucky can you get?

18:58.216 --> 19:01.180
Setting up there, I was up with six other P-51 pilots.

19:01.241 --> 19:03.684
Man, we're in a rat race, dog fight, having a ball.

19:03.804 --> 19:16.343
And I thought to myself, how lucky can you get, man, setting up here in a 51 that you were fighting with 42 years ago and still enjoy flying, still able to enjoy flying.

19:17.352 --> 19:26.421
You've got to get behind the guy, you've got to outmaneuver him, outturn him, you've got to know your airplane better, you've got to know the tricks of the trade.

19:26.461 --> 19:36.770
Man, cut him off, do everything you can to bleed every— It's understood when one guy is one—I mean, when we're playing now, obviously when you win in combat, you win.

19:37.251 --> 19:45.098
That's pretty evident, but when you're up there flying, if you get— Oh, get behind the guy, get a lead on him.

19:45.483 --> 19:57.021
See, because most of the guys, just like that lieutenant colonel in the F-86, it's something, it's experience that we got in training in P-39s.

19:59.224 --> 20:04.573
Man, the minute you broke ground, you better watch your ass, because some mother's sitting up there waiting on you.

20:04.593 --> 20:06.696
Always, because that's the way combat is.

20:07.337 --> 20:09.741
And the guy you don't see is the guy that nails you.

20:10.222 --> 20:10.562
And...

20:10.812 --> 20:16.421
Man, the minute you break ground, you wrap that thing around, you start watching because you know somebody's coming at you.

20:16.441 --> 20:21.889
If you see him coming, you break into him as you go by, then you get in a damn rat racing car.

20:21.909 --> 20:24.253
Some guys will, you know, it's a standoff.

20:24.273 --> 20:26.096
You're like Bob Hoover in the old days.

20:26.877 --> 20:28.419
Let me take down a couple notes here.

20:28.439 --> 20:29.240
Yeah.

20:29.321 --> 20:35.310
I like the fact that you're using your hands here to— Well, a firefighter can't talk that.

20:35.330 --> 20:36.752
I love his hands.

20:37.205 --> 20:41.854
Well, of course, you can't talk about getting on a guy's tail, you know, and pulling the lead on him.

20:41.874 --> 20:44.119
What do you mean, getting in front of him?

20:44.139 --> 20:44.660
Hello, Dan.

20:45.942 --> 20:50.792
You're talking about, you know, it's an old cliche that...

21:05.251 --> 21:06.453
No way, man.

21:07.114 --> 21:23.476
That's the reason that I laugh my head off when I see a newspaper report of a guy who's in an airplane and the engine quits or is on fire and he turns it away and hits the ground to miss the school bullshit.

21:23.496 --> 21:25.519
One thought in that guy's mind is survival.

21:26.520 --> 21:28.743
He never says nothing.

21:28.763 --> 21:30.205
Let's read it.

21:30.225 --> 21:30.666
You sit here.

21:30.686 --> 21:31.427
I can't talk to you.

21:35.356 --> 21:37.278
If a guy's asking you, where are you?

21:37.438 --> 21:40.661
And that's the thing, see?

21:40.681 --> 21:49.870
And that's really, very few, when a guy, if you've got two guys in an airplane, one of them got Diary of the Mountain, you'd hear a few words out of them.

21:49.890 --> 21:51.411
And you'd be happy to shut them up, too.

21:51.432 --> 21:52.072
Yeah, sure.

21:55.415 --> 21:59.840
To go back to terror, I think it's an important distinction between terror and panic.

22:00.640 --> 22:04.384
You can be terrified and not be panic.

22:05.275 --> 22:08.899
Panic and being terrified is two different things.

22:09.120 --> 22:13.725
Number one, you've got to be in a situation when you're panicked.

22:13.745 --> 22:20.012
You know, and that's, here again, I don't know of any reason to ever panic in an airplane.

22:20.052 --> 22:25.459
In fact, panic will kill you about as quick as anything else because it makes you do the wrong thing.

22:26.220 --> 22:26.780
What did you say?

22:26.800 --> 22:28.342
You can't think of a single reason?

22:29.343 --> 22:30.304
No.

22:30.344 --> 22:33.648
What's the worst scenario in an airplane?

22:33.668 --> 22:34.249
I don't know.

22:34.289 --> 22:35.130
Dead in the water.

22:38.654 --> 22:41.679
We use the expression, he's dead in the water.

22:41.999 --> 22:45.705
I can't think of anything worse than being dead and being in the water.

22:46.486 --> 22:48.670
You're sinking.

22:54.139 --> 22:59.467
Can you think of anything else you'd have wanted to do besides flying?

22:59.567 --> 23:00.509
Well, I like to hunt.

23:00.629 --> 23:01.310
I like to fish.

23:01.390 --> 23:03.113
Well, I mean professionally.

23:03.373 --> 23:05.657
For a living.

23:05.840 --> 23:08.784
You really didn't even do this for a living.

23:09.384 --> 23:10.345
No, no way.

23:10.846 --> 23:14.470
When you were flying the X-1, you were making two hundred and some odd bucks a month.

23:15.011 --> 23:19.176
And the other guys were getting, what bonuses for everybody?

23:19.236 --> 23:25.844
What I've noticed though, Nick, and what I've noticed though is, you know, being an author, it's a piece of credit.

23:25.864 --> 23:27.626
You write a book, number one on the best.

23:27.707 --> 23:30.510
I'd probably take that up.

23:30.550 --> 23:32.252
That must be very satisfying, though.

23:32.654 --> 23:34.896
Did you think this was going to hit number one?

23:35.056 --> 23:36.898
You see me laughing, don't you?

23:36.918 --> 23:37.739
Well, I do.

23:38.099 --> 23:39.301
No, I had no idea.

23:39.341 --> 23:42.224
And to put it bluntly, I think it's gotten completely out of hand.

23:42.724 --> 23:43.565
Oh, come on now.

23:43.585 --> 23:45.187
Well, no, that's the way I look at it.

23:45.507 --> 23:48.110
By the way, it goes back to how I started.

23:48.250 --> 23:51.633
You probably didn't realize that you are an American hero.

23:51.833 --> 23:53.095
That's right, and I still don't.

23:54.936 --> 24:01.463
The same way at the book, I was surprised when I read the book how good it turned out because Leo did a tremendous job.

24:02.540 --> 24:05.884
He worked mainly off the Air Force tapes, is that right?

24:05.904 --> 24:07.707
Yeah, but we had the manuscript.

24:08.007 --> 24:08.908
We didn't have a tape.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.150
We just had the manuscript.

24:10.550 --> 24:11.372
And I'll say one thing.

24:11.412 --> 24:16.398
Leo really, he's not a pilot, didn't know anything about flying, but he really learned that manuscript.

24:16.919 --> 24:22.606
Then he began to talk to me from his knowledge of it and expanding certain areas.

24:22.686 --> 24:24.869
And then, of course, he knew how I'd talk.

24:24.889 --> 24:26.631
He had a word processor.

24:26.812 --> 24:27.633
It's all computer.

24:27.993 --> 24:32.479
And when he ended up with that first paragraph and I read it, I couldn't believe it.

24:33.067 --> 24:42.676
Well, that's a great— Yeah, and he—it was his idea to put third people in it, because you can't be a smartass and say, man, I'm the world's greatest.

24:42.696 --> 24:48.721
There's nothing wrong with somebody else standing there.

24:49.162 --> 24:51.524
Well, how do you feel about that, though?

24:52.745 --> 24:54.106
The world's greatest.

24:54.126 --> 25:00.492
I think that that can be said without fear of— The thing is, like, I'll be the first one to admit that

25:01.332 --> 25:06.677
Yeah, I've made mistakes in my life in airplanes, but I learned from them.

25:06.697 --> 25:07.558
And you walked away from them.

25:07.658 --> 25:08.679
Yeah.

25:08.699 --> 25:09.459
That's number one.

25:09.940 --> 25:11.081
Yeah, that's the main thing.

25:11.441 --> 25:17.167
And secondly, it's that a lot of those guys were better than I was, except they didn't live.

25:18.067 --> 25:20.129
They weren't better than you were.

25:20.149 --> 25:21.230
You don't believe that, really?

25:21.511 --> 25:27.156
Well, yeah, at certain times there were guys that were better at doing things than I was.

25:27.216 --> 25:29.618
Oh, Jim Fitzgerald, that mother could land an airplane

25:30.138 --> 25:31.540
a lot better than I could.

25:32.362 --> 25:33.504
I mean he was good.

25:33.544 --> 25:39.735
He couldn't do some other things as good as I could, but I in turn couldn't land an airplane as good as he could.

25:39.755 --> 25:45.966
Have you ever been shot off an aircraft carrier?

25:45.986 --> 25:46.226
Yeah.

25:46.246 --> 25:49.632
I've landed on aircraft carriers.

25:57.661 --> 26:00.525
No, to me, I've landed on carriers.

26:00.546 --> 26:02.549
I've been shot off of them.

26:02.969 --> 26:07.216
It's no different than a lot of other stuff.

26:07.777 --> 26:16.510
You see, I make one statement when guys begin to admire Air Force pilots and Navy pilots flying F-18s and F-16s and F-15s.

26:17.051 --> 26:25.845
I said, and that statement is that Uncle Sam doesn't buy a piece of equipment that the average guy can't operate, period.

26:28.323 --> 26:31.829
It's very hard to—they can't operate.

26:31.849 --> 26:35.376
But how about operating in a superior— An average guy can't.

26:35.476 --> 26:39.724
Of course, he's got to have training in it, obviously, but he's an average guy.

26:39.804 --> 26:41.567
Otherwise Uncle Sam wouldn't buy it or would be loose.

26:41.587 --> 26:42.249
Well, that's right.

26:43.511 --> 26:48.981
Because we do have missions to accomplish, yeah.

27:05.144 --> 27:07.767
I guess you have mixed feelings about that.

27:07.907 --> 27:09.648
Well, it's not the mixed feelings.

27:09.668 --> 27:13.612
Most people, after they read Tom's book, say some of the right stuff.

27:13.772 --> 27:15.134
That's what it takes to fly.

27:16.295 --> 27:19.939
You know, that's what it takes to be a success in an airplane.

27:19.959 --> 27:21.840
Well, I get a little annoyed.

27:22.401 --> 27:31.590
Like, I've had people say, my son, like, when you sign my book to my son, he's flying F-15s, and say, John, you have the right stuff, Will.

27:34.709 --> 27:35.750
I see.

27:36.531 --> 27:38.993
What I say is, dear John, fly safe.

27:40.975 --> 27:50.925
Well, that's a very important point, I think, is that people confuse the fact that you are willing to go to the absolute outer limits.

27:52.246 --> 27:53.928
They confuse that with recklessness.

27:54.548 --> 27:55.229
Yeah.

27:55.249 --> 27:57.211
And I think maybe you could comment on that.

27:57.812 --> 28:01.375
When you were knowingly going to these absolute outer limits,

28:05.624 --> 28:07.707
doing it, because that was my job.

28:08.848 --> 28:13.195
But you also knew that you, you also had confidence that you would be in the equipment.

28:13.775 --> 28:23.609
When I, you know when I fly an airplane, unless we got something, a fallout from exceeding the red line, I never exceed a red line on an airplane, because I know the end result.

28:23.629 --> 28:32.982
Just like when old Dab and I were doing the time to climb in the, in the Piper Shine 400, we exceeded the red line, but we knew, we know that those engines are

28:33.316 --> 28:41.005
designed to operate at that region for a short period of time, not forever, because, man, it's going to start flying apart on you pretty soon.

28:41.145 --> 28:45.050
And you do that in the book in one case, too, where you were flying with another aircraft.

28:45.070 --> 28:46.131
Yeah, I wanted to make a point.

28:47.212 --> 28:54.240
I knew that I could run the thing up the tailpipe temperature to about 715 instead of 700 with a redlining.

28:54.661 --> 29:01.108
I knew I could do it for an hour or two, but then we're going to start changing turbine blades and tailpipes.

29:01.128 --> 29:01.669
That's a point.

29:06.644 --> 29:09.707
You don't elect anybody to crash a plane.

29:09.727 --> 29:19.956
Yeah, but I also know that there isn't anything that you can do with an airplane if somebody hasn't already done it, including flying it into the ground.

29:20.897 --> 29:25.340
I mean, half the people won't even turn around and look at the smoking hole, but that's one thing.

29:26.221 --> 29:29.604
You don't go shine your ass on an airplane because you're not impressing anybody.

29:29.684 --> 29:30.465
It's already been done.

29:31.266 --> 29:35.149
You say you're not superstitious, but you never use the word crash.

29:35.888 --> 29:44.396
Well, if I write, if I'm writing up a report on one of my pilots, you know, he'd crash, you know, crash report.

29:44.657 --> 29:49.522
We use that word in here, crash report, but you never, guys don't use that expression.

29:49.662 --> 29:53.325
It's because of the more nonchalant statements.

29:53.345 --> 29:57.770
But I think it's just something that we don't do anyway.

29:57.890 --> 30:00.072
It's obvious, never crash.

30:00.472 --> 30:02.014
You only get one chance.

30:02.365 --> 30:17.320
You get the impression that, as much as you love these guys that you flew with and fought with, or did test flying with, when the guy screwed up and did all go in or buy the farm or whatever, you got mad.

30:17.780 --> 30:20.203
You almost felt something approaching contempt.

30:21.044 --> 30:30.313
It's like I said in my book, and that's the reason you never get too close to it, guys.

30:30.952 --> 30:34.457
Even all during our training, you know, when you're in a flying fighter.

30:35.259 --> 30:39.245
Our P-39s in the old days, we lost a lot of guys in training.

30:40.507 --> 30:45.975
And then you got pretty close to two or three of the better guys.

30:46.015 --> 30:47.698
They didn't bust their ass in combat.

30:47.718 --> 30:49.040
They got killed in combat.

30:50.081 --> 30:51.483
They didn't bust their ass in training.

30:52.024 --> 30:53.767
Because they were good enough.

30:53.787 --> 30:55.389
And then you say, well, there's a great guy.

30:55.409 --> 30:57.072
And you start buddying around with them.

30:57.092 --> 30:58.254
You hunt, chase women with them.

30:58.314 --> 30:58.995
Have a good time.

30:59.035 --> 30:59.676
Get drunk.

31:00.061 --> 31:06.808
Then you go to combat, man, the guy gets blown out of the sky, and he says, you know, you hate that.

31:07.309 --> 31:23.106
And then, in order to become calloused, then you don't get close to guys, so when they do get killed, and then to actually make yourself feel better that the guy, you know, is dead, you get mad at him.

31:24.467 --> 31:24.848
That's right.

31:24.868 --> 31:27.250
Well, it's a defensive mechanism as much as the other thing.

31:27.270 --> 31:28.051
That's right.

31:28.151 --> 31:29.713
It's a defensive mechanism.

31:30.267 --> 31:35.553
It's like, you know, hell, betting on the opposite team when you're playing football.

31:35.593 --> 31:38.677
You feel bad for losing, but you feel a little better because you want some money.

31:39.978 --> 31:45.024
What of all the many achievements were you said as your product?

31:45.725 --> 31:46.666
The X one, probably.

31:47.647 --> 31:53.514
Because that was truly— At that time, I didn't—I really didn't realize that, but that meant an awful lot.

31:53.534 --> 31:57.439
See, we were hamstrung by a barrier, and we couldn't do a damn thing until we—

31:57.942 --> 31:58.823
got in an airplane.

31:59.144 --> 32:03.269
I also am smart enough to realize if I hadn't done it, somebody else would have.

32:03.370 --> 32:04.772
There were a lot of guys back there.

32:04.792 --> 32:05.533
Well, yeah.

32:05.553 --> 32:07.435
Very eager to sit in there.

32:07.455 --> 32:08.597
Yeah, but they weren't there.

32:08.857 --> 32:12.803
That was kind of a ballsy thing, though, for the Air Force to take over that program.

32:13.003 --> 32:13.804
Damn right.

32:14.365 --> 32:25.941
And I'm glad you caught that, because that was some—a lot of very senior officers watched old General Boyd, or then Colonel Boyd's

32:26.748 --> 32:32.961
It wasn't only Colonel Boyd who was instrumental in getting that X-1.

32:33.001 --> 32:37.811
It was the whole engineering division of the Air Force, two-star generals.

32:39.234 --> 32:43.503
What they began to notice, who's flying jet airplanes?

32:43.523 --> 32:45.567
The Air Force is not the civilians.

32:47.268 --> 32:52.996
Hell, our test pilots are head and shoulders above the best of civilian test pilots now.

32:53.817 --> 32:56.762
See, those civilian test pilots didn't fly into war.

32:57.743 --> 33:15.008
And so when I came back, and Bob Hoover, you know, the captain, the second and the first lieutenant, he said, see, I'm sitting there, the contractor's pilot sat in that plant for four years and flew, you know, B-24s or P-51s or something like that.

33:15.548 --> 33:16.650
We came back then—

33:16.934 --> 33:28.386
Then we were flying all of the new German airplanes, the Jap airplanes, and suddenly, by the spring of 1947, they realized, hey, man, those guys in flight tests are shit hot.

33:28.506 --> 33:30.669
The Sierra Hotel.

33:31.089 --> 33:33.251
That's what I told Stu when he got there.

33:33.692 --> 33:35.914
He told me he wanted to use Chuck Yeager.

33:35.934 --> 33:37.296
I said, Sierra Hotel.

33:37.316 --> 33:39.598
He said, what the hell does that mean?

33:39.618 --> 33:40.159
I said, U.S.

33:40.179 --> 33:40.820
General Yeager.

33:40.840 --> 33:42.141
Yeah, right.

33:42.161 --> 33:46.806
Well, what I'm getting at is suddenly the Air Force began to realize that, hey,

33:47.275 --> 33:51.159
man, why are we letting these civilians do this?

33:51.179 --> 33:52.200
You know, it's a lot of money.

33:52.220 --> 33:54.683
It was costing—and it was Air Force money.

33:54.703 --> 33:56.565
That bonus money comes right out of our pocket.

33:56.585 --> 33:58.146
That is so very political, too.

33:58.186 --> 34:02.331
I mean, I'm sure that there were a lot of people who maybe wanted to see you guys fail.

34:02.871 --> 34:03.832
Well, there were.

34:03.852 --> 34:11.140
Man, like in my book, I point out that I've had guys, you know, civilian test pilots just

34:11.423 --> 34:28.360
really blow their stack at me for—if I go fly their airplane, if I fly it on a missions crust, I'll spin the goddamn thing, do everything to evaluate the airplane, and then you come down and I've wiped out about three bonus flights for them, you know?

34:29.441 --> 34:39.311
One question—it's not in the book and I suspect it's probably—you don't want to say this on the tape or something—but I'm wondering why this general—I can't remember his name—had it in for you when we were in Vietnam?

34:39.331 --> 34:41.413
Professional jealousy.

34:42.237 --> 34:45.341
See, it's not me personally.

34:45.361 --> 34:46.603
He's just a jerk.

34:46.883 --> 34:48.405
He stood in your way.

34:48.445 --> 34:49.787
He would not allow you to go.

34:49.887 --> 34:52.610
Go to Phan Rang in Vietnam and be the wing commander.

34:52.770 --> 34:54.132
Well, so what?

34:54.152 --> 34:56.235
Just like old General Davis told me.

34:56.335 --> 34:57.897
He said, it's not you personally.

34:57.937 --> 35:04.285
It's just that he's, you know, he's a commander of 7th Air Force, and he says he picks his own wing commander.

35:04.425 --> 35:07.169
Christ, he wouldn't take you if you were going.

35:07.189 --> 35:08.971
You're the best pilot in the Air Force.

35:08.991 --> 35:10.893
That won't make any difference to him.

35:10.913 --> 35:11.434
You see,

35:12.697 --> 35:20.064
The point is, and I've noticed this amongst some generals, most officers, when they make general, don't change.

35:20.724 --> 35:22.546
There's a few who do change.

35:23.647 --> 35:27.150
And they change because they made general.

35:27.931 --> 35:29.452
They think, well, I'm a four-star.

35:29.552 --> 35:30.533
I have to do it.

35:30.653 --> 35:32.315
I have to be a prick.

35:32.335 --> 35:33.676
Well, prick got ahead.

35:33.716 --> 35:37.399
He wouldn't even make it a prick.

35:37.419 --> 35:39.021
Your prick is verbatim.

35:39.121 --> 35:41.623
Don't worry about it.

35:42.076 --> 35:49.164
You know, I've gotten about twenty letters from guys that I can write on, man.

35:49.185 --> 35:50.146
That was really great.

35:50.166 --> 35:52.569
That son of a bitch, I hated you and all this.

35:53.169 --> 36:01.079
Another thing that generated the most mail that I've gotten from an interview was in the Newsweek magazine.

36:03.422 --> 36:10.530
You know, I talked about the majority of, in talking about Vietnam veterans playing on the sympathy of the public,

36:11.287 --> 36:18.314
and coming home and say, I'm a—man, I've got to smoke marijuana because I fought in Vietnam.

36:18.334 --> 36:19.235
That's baloney.

36:19.836 --> 36:27.003
And I said in that interview, I said, the majority of the guys who came home from Vietnam with a dope problem took it there with them.

36:27.023 --> 36:27.864
No question about it.

36:27.964 --> 36:30.287
And boy, I've gotten a hundred and some letters.

36:30.627 --> 36:32.329
When I first came back— Right on.

36:32.389 --> 36:33.570
That's exactly the way it went.

36:33.590 --> 36:39.336
I did two cruises in the Gulf.

36:40.177 --> 36:41.499
jerks in the first place.

36:41.579 --> 36:43.082
I mean they were doing this back home.

36:43.542 --> 36:53.778
But when I get back and I get into the newspaper business, I did some stories on guys who were at the vet hospitals, purportedly breaking the habit that they acquired over there.

36:53.798 --> 36:56.242
I mean it was one kid in particular who was a liar.

36:56.643 --> 36:58.265
I'm sure he was a liar before he went in.

36:58.285 --> 36:59.107
He was a thief.

36:59.127 --> 37:03.113
I'm sure he was a thief before he went in.

37:03.937 --> 37:09.023
Two weeks, no, two months later you get out and you get into a shootout with the state police and they blow him away.

37:09.404 --> 37:11.466
You're telling me that Vietnam did this to him?

37:11.486 --> 37:14.630
He was a thief, he was an armed robber, he was a drug addict.

37:14.990 --> 37:16.272
These are personal qualities.

37:16.292 --> 37:17.774
Just like you say, people don't change.

37:17.794 --> 37:19.095
They don't change that much.

37:19.115 --> 37:21.578
I mean, you're essentially the same person you were.

37:21.598 --> 37:32.712
You're probably a little wiser than you were 40 years ago, but I'm sure you'd still talk into a P-51 and go dogfight right now for the opportunity to present itself.

37:39.408 --> 37:51.382
You're a career Air Force officer, you're a general officer, and yet you show a marked disdain for Mickey Mouse and chicken shit type regulations.

37:51.502 --> 37:54.125
Well, and it got you in some trouble a couple times.

37:54.145 --> 37:57.189
Yeah, but hell, it got me in trouble cause I exceeded.

37:57.890 --> 37:59.592
I wasn't careful.

37:59.932 --> 38:02.175
I didn't cover my ass.

38:03.033 --> 38:07.698
No, that's where you've got to— Do you get angry with ridiculous rules?

38:07.758 --> 38:09.159
No, I don't get angry.

38:09.179 --> 38:15.045
What I do, regulations are written as a guideline, and God damn it, that's the way I look at them.

38:15.565 --> 38:22.512
And if I'm a wing commander, I also am tolerant if I go down and ask some crew chief, hey, why are you doing it this way?

38:22.572 --> 38:25.735
The God damn tech order says to do it this way.

38:25.875 --> 38:30.019
And if he can show me that it's better to do it this way, I'll go along.

38:30.159 --> 38:32.922
If he can't, I say, bullshit, you go back and do it the way—

38:34.150 --> 38:36.072
because, God damn it, that's the best way.

38:36.372 --> 38:39.776
Yeah, but there's a couple incidents in there where you're pulling some pins out of things.

38:39.796 --> 38:50.467
Well, you know, those guys that put those God damn big pins, you can't fly an airplane with a fucking pin sticking through your finger and fight with it.

38:50.547 --> 38:51.868
But see, they never fought.

38:52.008 --> 38:54.090
They never flew a fighter and fought with it.

38:54.491 --> 38:56.433
Now, you never get into the space program.

38:56.933 --> 38:58.755
I didn't have a college degree.

38:58.775 --> 38:59.736
It's that simple.

39:04.660 --> 39:06.742
Because it wasn't—I had much better deals.

39:08.083 --> 39:12.268
You know, I had much—I was having much more fun flying research airplanes to running that.

39:12.568 --> 39:14.890
I mean, as you point out, the monkeys went up first.

39:14.910 --> 39:17.113
They weren't even going to give these guys a window.

39:17.133 --> 39:21.297
The original savage astronauts didn't do any research, period.

39:22.178 --> 39:30.506
The vehicle research was done by remote control, and the physiological research was done by goddamn monkeys.

39:30.526 --> 39:33.469
And then when they strapped old Shepard in it, mother of the showman,

39:33.854 --> 39:36.478
What the hell were they learning from Shepard?

39:36.798 --> 39:39.302
Nothing.

39:39.322 --> 39:45.751
It must have been kind of aggravating to see all these guys get these Life magazine contracts and all the edulants.

39:45.771 --> 39:47.754
Yeah, but it pissed me off highly.

39:49.076 --> 39:51.440
And I said so too, and I still say so.

39:52.341 --> 40:02.055
Because what you do—and I explain in the book are the kids that I was training in the astronaut school who were being taken to NASA at Houston and interviewed

40:02.339 --> 40:05.884
when they came back and I'd talk to them, I said, hey what's it look like?

40:06.004 --> 40:08.749
I said, god damn, I wonder what our cut of this time of life got.

40:08.769 --> 40:11.272
I said, hey, it's ruined.

40:11.973 --> 40:19.264
You don't have much, I was interested to say, you don't have a very high regard for Neil Armstrong.

40:19.284 --> 40:19.745
I don't think.

40:20.526 --> 40:22.830
I watched Neil Armstrong work on the X-15.

40:23.430 --> 40:24.612
He's a wonderful engineer.

40:24.632 --> 40:27.216
I always thought that when

40:35.735 --> 40:39.481
But Armstrong always gets credit for that, doesn't he?

40:39.561 --> 40:40.683
No, he really doesn't.

40:41.384 --> 40:51.500
Another thing, if you do a little research on the moon landing, you'll see that Neil Armstrong was within about two and a half seconds of being brought back into lunar orbit.

40:52.622 --> 40:52.922
Really?

40:53.102 --> 40:53.523
Yes, sir.

40:53.603 --> 40:55.386
His fuel was that close.

40:55.506 --> 40:58.671
He was flubbing around down on the surface of the moon.

40:59.849 --> 41:01.832
There's nothing wrong with Neil Armstrong.

41:01.852 --> 41:02.753
He did a good job.

41:02.974 --> 41:08.802
And I don't mean to imply that I get the sense out of it, but you judge him as a professional.

41:09.123 --> 41:09.744
That's right.

41:09.864 --> 41:11.346
That costs him in flying.

41:11.767 --> 41:17.275
I judge people as pilots, not engineers.

41:17.295 --> 41:22.903
General, I think I've used up my 45 minutes.

41:23.643 --> 41:26.066
You know, I've got two books here.

41:26.146 --> 41:30.470
One that I'd like you to sign for me and one for my father, who thinks it's bad.

41:31.111 --> 41:31.331
Really?

41:31.391 --> 41:32.372
Yeah, yeah.

41:32.393 --> 41:33.374
He's still kicking.

41:33.394 --> 41:33.874
No, he's kicking good.

41:33.894 --> 41:39.440
His name is John.

41:39.460 --> 41:41.522
What did you do for a living?

41:41.542 --> 41:45.687
You showed you have very great respect for the women pilots that you've done.

41:45.767 --> 41:51.253
Pancho and Jackie Cosa and a lot of gals, especially with

41:53.123 --> 42:03.432
The WASP, during the war, I never met any because we were always in combat, you know, and they weren't allowed to be in it there, but they sure smoked around the United States a lot.

42:04.553 --> 42:07.295
I mean, the Earhart is probably the worst woman pilot who ever went.

42:07.315 --> 42:07.756
You're right.

42:07.916 --> 42:10.899
I mean, the Earhart never flew many different kinds of airplanes.

42:10.919 --> 42:15.443
Just like today, this gal, Brooke Nat, shit.

42:18.806 --> 42:19.846
I don't even know this name.

42:19.947 --> 42:21.348
Where is she supposed to be?

42:21.368 --> 42:21.628
Well,

42:26.823 --> 42:31.149
She did a flight across the country, and she was like two states.

42:31.470 --> 42:33.112
Her navigation was so bad.

42:33.993 --> 42:39.020
She was in Kansas and thought she was in—have you ever heard about an unbelievable situation?

42:39.521 --> 42:43.647
Well, the reason I admire Jackie, you see, and there again, it's a matter of experience.

42:43.667 --> 42:46.531
She had a world of experience on a lot of airplanes.

42:46.551 --> 42:54.362
She'd run these 100-kilometer course records, a 2.2 Mach and a 104, single cockpit 104, and do a beautiful job.

42:54.583 --> 42:56.205
She still had the best teacher going, though.

42:56.540 --> 43:03.952
A lot of people gave you some flack on that, that you kind of let her around the course.

43:03.972 --> 43:04.533
There's no way.

43:04.573 --> 43:05.955
I couldn't even catch her for Christy.

43:06.035 --> 43:11.524
She was flying a 2.2 and I was flying a Mach 2 airplane.

43:12.766 --> 43:14.308
What else can I ask you?

43:14.328 --> 43:19.556
You'd probably like a little time for yourself here before the next day I can sit around.

43:21.019 --> 43:22.581
Great stuff.

43:23.523 --> 43:30.769
Are there any other frontiers in aviation that you think you'd like to— No, there's not an awful lot of milestones left to do.

43:30.969 --> 43:37.134
You know, I was at the right time, props, and the jets, and the rockets, and breaking the sound barrier on out.

43:37.315 --> 43:41.578
You know, we realized we'd never been above about .8 mark, and that's the whole thing.

43:41.598 --> 43:45.101
It all happened in about 10, 15 years.

43:45.621 --> 43:48.344
And the kind of dogfighting you did, that's going forever.

43:49.164 --> 43:53.428
Now you've got two guys up there, one guy always working on— I'll tell you, though,

43:53.898 --> 44:01.546
The days of energy management dogfighting and missiles, like I fly the F-20 a lot.

44:01.566 --> 44:04.289
I also fly F-18s, F-16s, F-15s.

44:05.190 --> 44:22.808
And what we're developing now is a snap-up chute system where a guy coming in on you, man, you can go through about 55 degrees angle of attack and these real fast missiles that we've got are developing, man, you zap him and get out because if you hang around you're going to get killed.

44:23.328 --> 44:24.970
Is there dogfighting today?

44:25.490 --> 44:26.351
Is it dogfighting?

44:26.571 --> 44:31.576
It's only called that— Are you technicians executing weapons systems?

44:31.596 --> 44:34.999
It's called tactical maneuvers, you know.

44:35.019 --> 44:38.983
Dogfighting today is—it's still called that, but it really isn't.

44:39.003 --> 44:42.146
They're not even heat-seeking missiles right now, right?

44:42.186 --> 44:44.609
You don't have to get behind the guy to get them.

44:45.349 --> 44:48.793
No, it'll—anything it'll track on.

44:49.053 --> 44:53.217
That was a valid escape, though, in the early days of Sideliners, wasn't it?

44:54.901 --> 44:58.587
Well, he had her, like the Israel pilots, kick out flares.

44:58.647 --> 45:08.763
But the point is also, most all sidewinders, like you couldn't fire a sidewinder if you were pulling more than two Gs because you'd exceed the sidewinder's capability to maneuver.

45:09.084 --> 45:15.173
Same way if a sidewinder's tracking you, if you pull more than about five Gs, he couldn't stay with you.

45:15.193 --> 45:19.480
But these new missiles are extremely maneuverable, and he's nowhere getting away from.

45:20.101 --> 45:20.662
Reliable.

45:21.684 --> 45:22.545
And I never thought I'd

45:22.897 --> 45:30.370
live to see the day when I say that a goddamn gun is surplus weight today in a new airplane.

45:30.390 --> 45:31.932
They don't have them, do they?

45:31.952 --> 45:32.573
Yeah, they got them.

45:32.593 --> 45:38.523
In fact, they're insisting on putting them in, but goddammit, you fool around with a gun, you're going to get killed real quick with a missile.

45:38.664 --> 45:41.829
You mentioned there was a guy who actually shot himself down.

45:41.909 --> 45:42.770
Well, sure, Mach 2.

45:42.790 --> 45:45.495
You know, bullet slows up below Mach 1 after.

45:45.813 --> 45:47.621
Well, who would do that?

45:47.701 --> 45:55.536
Well, all it is is pull an object, and he flew in these bullets.
