WEBVTT

00:02.528 --> 00:04.710
Okay.

00:06.351 --> 00:12.116
As a matter of fact, I've got two books down there on Chandler that I'm reading.

00:12.576 --> 00:14.418
I'm starting to reread all his stuff.

00:16.079 --> 00:16.620
Funny writer.

00:16.720 --> 00:23.125
Oh, magnificent writer, I think.

00:24.286 --> 00:32.113
So, I think he's slowly but surely climbing that ladder of recognition among English

00:32.633 --> 00:35.836
Do you have a Gatsby?

00:35.856 --> 00:38.458
Yeah, but not with the jacket.

00:38.478 --> 00:53.410
The problem with the jacket, with Gatsby, was that the original one that came out was so fragile, and I think there were only 60 that came out, and they were recalled.

00:53.491 --> 00:57.774
The book was recalled, and see if I can remember how this worked.

00:57.794 --> 01:02.438
And then they put out another one, and that was a second edition.

01:04.477 --> 01:10.685
So the Gatsby that I have is a mint copy, but it doesn't have the jacket.

01:11.186 --> 01:15.591
Oh, the Great Gatsby, if you had it with the jacket, it'd cost you $10,000.

01:15.651 --> 01:18.695
Yep, and it basically all fits sterile books.

01:19.897 --> 01:24.082
Very few of them seem to survive with the dust jackets.

01:24.102 --> 01:31.371
My parents religiously took the dust jackets off before they put it on the shelf.

01:31.391 --> 01:32.553
Heard it coming from.

01:32.573 --> 01:32.813
I've got a

01:33.282 --> 01:36.265
by Carter Burden in my book, who just died earlier this year.

01:38.047 --> 01:44.553
He spent $20,000 to get Sinclair Lewis's first book, which was synonymously written.

01:44.573 --> 01:48.617
It was a children's book called Hike in the Airplane by Tom Graham.

01:48.637 --> 01:50.058
Never heard of it.

01:50.078 --> 01:50.979
Yeah, it's a lovely guy.

01:50.999 --> 01:52.220
There's only about 1,300 copies of it.

01:52.741 --> 01:56.144
He already had a copy of it, but he paid $20,000 to get the testimony.

01:56.164 --> 01:56.465
Yeah.

01:57.005 --> 01:59.327
Unless you can have that kind of money, I suppose you can do it.

02:01.269 --> 02:03.171
Well, I mean, that's...

02:03.472 --> 02:04.293
That's the key.

02:04.433 --> 02:11.684
I mean, for instance, to get a copy of Treasure of Sierra Madre with the jacket is almost impossible.

02:12.906 --> 02:15.510
You remember Joe, the pro, Joseph, the provider.

02:15.610 --> 02:16.711
Yeah, I get his catalog.

02:16.731 --> 02:17.292
He does, though.

02:17.312 --> 02:19.535
His prices, of course, are... He's crazy.

02:19.636 --> 02:21.498
But he's out in the business now.

02:21.879 --> 02:22.880
Yeah, he just went out.

02:23.020 --> 02:26.786
I don't, you know, I use... Yeah, I know, I know.

02:26.846 --> 02:31.673
He's... I would call him up and I would say, put

02:32.075 --> 02:33.257
What is it with you, Winnie?

02:33.277 --> 02:34.258
Oh, what's his name again?

02:34.278 --> 02:35.180
I can't remember.

02:35.200 --> 02:36.402
Yeah, the three of them.

02:36.422 --> 02:38.064
Oh, there's Larry and Moe.

02:38.084 --> 02:41.510
Yeah, I used to call him Larry and Moe and Curly and Moe.

02:43.292 --> 02:46.598
The prices are... Oh, yeah.

02:46.618 --> 02:47.299
Yeah.

02:47.319 --> 02:47.900
Lolita?

02:47.920 --> 02:48.460
You have a Lolita?

02:49.021 --> 02:50.243
No, I don't have that.

02:50.744 --> 02:54.049
And that was a movie, I guess.

02:54.169 --> 02:55.091
Oh, yeah.

02:55.111 --> 02:55.311
Yeah.

02:55.752 --> 02:56.513
But again...

02:56.982 --> 03:00.586
That wasn't a movie that would move my soul.

03:00.686 --> 03:09.536
Now, if I saw a great copy of Lolita, and Price was right, and it was in good condition, I'd say, hey, you know, I want that.

03:11.238 --> 03:17.645
And I guess I did ask you whether or not this goes off into the stage, and I guess we're currently not.

03:19.307 --> 03:20.068
Stage plays.

03:20.929 --> 03:21.690
Oh, yeah.

03:24.185 --> 03:52.842
like streetcar yeah sure yeah oh yeah that was with marlon brando yeah yeah and uh i don't have i don't have a streetcar that's a tough one with that purple jacket oh yeah i do as a matter of fact i do have that it's a tall book it's what it's tall it's the highest emphasis

03:52.957 --> 04:09.453
No, no, I want to, yeah, I'm pretty, see, I, I ought to go through this a little more often because I, I get them, I put them away, and then, uh, I'm pretty sure I have, I just got a, it was slew.

04:10.654 --> 04:12.556
And it was their breakfast at Tiffany's.

04:13.076 --> 04:13.377
I do.

04:14.458 --> 04:19.803
And that, uh, I can swear on my street cut.

04:19.823 --> 04:21.124
One old book, very tall.

04:21.914 --> 04:22.856
How tall is it?

04:23.016 --> 04:25.301
It's tall, my God.

04:26.263 --> 04:27.846
Doesn't street car have a purple?

04:27.946 --> 04:28.768
Yeah, it has a purple.

04:29.369 --> 04:33.097
It's very ugly, and the sun is terribly.

04:33.117 --> 04:36.083
Very, very rarely do you see one of them.

04:36.163 --> 04:37.365
Here's another book, Bob.

04:37.466 --> 04:43.618
I could have sworn that I had it out here the other day, now that I think about it, and I can't see it.

04:44.982 --> 04:50.006
And I'm always the one who's put them somewhere when you can't find them.

04:50.026 --> 04:53.169
Breakfast at Tiffany's, yeah, I got that.

04:53.189 --> 04:56.412
Well, that was a nice movie.

04:56.432 --> 04:56.952
That was a fun movie.

04:56.972 --> 04:59.915
I'm surprised that you don't have that one for Charlie, because that was a wonderful movie.

04:59.935 --> 05:01.936
Here's Breakfast at Tiffany's.

05:01.956 --> 05:03.037
That's tough, yeah.

05:03.057 --> 05:04.719
I know it, in that condition.

05:04.959 --> 05:07.041
Yeah.

05:07.361 --> 05:08.302
Where the hell is this?

05:08.462 --> 05:09.743
What about Lord of the Flies?

05:09.843 --> 05:12.185
It wasn't such a great movie, but it was a fine book.

05:12.205 --> 05:14.787
You've got it there, I'm sure.

05:15.357 --> 05:16.518
No, I don't have that.

05:16.538 --> 05:22.505
That's a very difficult book to find in The Big Sky, The Hustler.

05:22.665 --> 05:24.127
You know, this is great.

05:24.487 --> 05:25.088
It's kind of fun.

05:26.870 --> 05:27.931
Boy, I'm a little upset.

05:27.951 --> 05:31.295
You're still a lot of summer for a sweet time.

05:31.315 --> 05:32.376
Don't look at my account.

05:35.499 --> 05:37.161
Well, this is a very difficult book.

05:37.221 --> 05:37.942
Little Caesar.

05:38.983 --> 05:39.964
Not a great movie.

05:40.400 --> 05:41.802
But it was L.Y.G.

05:41.862 --> 05:44.786
Robinson, yeah, and to find it in that condition.

05:44.826 --> 05:45.427
Who's the author?

05:46.449 --> 05:46.930
Burnett.

05:48.051 --> 05:48.832
Yeah, Burnett.

05:48.972 --> 05:49.173
W.R.

05:49.193 --> 05:52.237
Burnett.

05:52.257 --> 05:53.559
Here's my Maltese.

05:55.502 --> 05:59.568
That's in fairly good condition.

05:59.648 --> 06:03.373
And Jack, of course.

06:03.414 --> 06:08.241
I'm surprised you don't collect ephemeral things like posters.

06:08.261 --> 06:09.242
Well, you don't have room.

06:10.488 --> 06:11.569
I don't have room.

06:12.990 --> 06:13.891
The ceiling, Bill.

06:15.272 --> 06:16.874
Well, this is our only place.

06:16.914 --> 06:17.935
The ceiling's one.

06:18.075 --> 06:19.056
He knows about that.

06:19.076 --> 06:20.277
Put them up on the ceiling.

06:21.618 --> 06:23.580
And we think it's real, but how do we know?

06:23.900 --> 06:32.387
Well, here's my Forrest Gump, but this is an advanced reading, and it's an advanced reading copy, which I don't know.

06:32.407 --> 06:34.209
I don't know where Forrest Gump is going to turn.

06:34.249 --> 06:36.871
You know, believe it or not, I haven't seen the movie.

06:36.891 --> 06:37.932
It's pretty good.

06:38.072 --> 06:38.773
I had

06:40.222 --> 06:41.803
I didn't expect that.

06:41.823 --> 06:47.388
I really was wary about a book that celebrated mediocrity, I guess, that bothered me, but it was very moving.

06:47.709 --> 06:51.912
There's stage that they made a movie in, The Children's Hour, okay, Lillian Hellman.

06:53.213 --> 06:56.677
And, of course, you got a nice copy of Catch-22.

06:56.697 --> 07:00.640
One of the hell is one of the streetcars.

07:00.660 --> 07:04.664
As a matter of fact, they're not going, though.

07:04.684 --> 07:06.065
Now.

07:06.085 --> 07:08.507
Start making a list of the ones you can't learn.

07:09.415 --> 07:10.336
You won't sleep there.

07:10.456 --> 07:13.461
I mean, you won't sleep there.

07:13.481 --> 07:16.665
Well, you just described it with the, it does have that.

07:16.745 --> 07:22.293
It has, it does have, and it has on the front of the jacket, it has kind of an unusual.

07:22.353 --> 07:24.977
It suns very badly on the spine, too.

07:24.997 --> 07:25.398
Yeah.

07:28.602 --> 07:32.988
That's why, you know, I don't, it drives me crazy.

07:33.129 --> 07:35.091
I'm sorry, it's my fault.

07:36.493 --> 07:38.376
I probably just filed it somewhere, but I,

07:39.115 --> 07:39.876
I don't know where.

07:45.865 --> 07:48.028
I'll find it around here somewhere.

07:48.048 --> 07:51.172
I'll tell you a book that's very hard to find is King of the Kyber Rifles.

07:51.192 --> 07:52.134
I mean, yeah.

07:53.115 --> 07:56.560
And that was a fairly decent movie.

07:56.580 --> 07:59.104
So you have a nice and med over there, I see.

07:59.985 --> 08:01.407
It's a nice copy.

08:01.608 --> 08:04.592
It's a very good copy, except for one thing.

08:05.373 --> 08:08.177
Someone had a sticker they put on there where the F is.

08:08.647 --> 08:29.153
and part of the f is off other than that it's a mint don't you hate that what about the old man in the sea that's a good copy yeah there it is right there that's a very that was a great movie yeah yeah yeah nice good stuff i know your time is tight so

08:29.555 --> 08:31.438
Do you have Lonesome Dove, Larry McMurtry?

08:31.458 --> 08:33.080
I noticed you had the last picture show.

08:33.100 --> 08:34.643
No, I don't have the Lonesome Dove.

08:34.863 --> 08:37.908
And that really was a TV series.

08:38.048 --> 08:40.592
Yeah, but boy, I want to tell you, it was a wonderful series.

08:40.612 --> 08:41.634
It was, yeah.

08:41.674 --> 08:42.395
I really enjoyed it.

08:42.455 --> 08:48.684
So really, you don't break the rules, the rules that you... Well, you know, once in a while, I mean, I'll break it.

08:48.704 --> 08:50.387
You bend them a little bit.

08:50.788 --> 08:52.150
Yeah, a little bit.

08:53.492 --> 08:55.715
So is this where you screen your movies in here?

08:56.256 --> 08:58.159
Mm-hmm.

08:58.179 --> 08:58.279
Yeah.

08:58.698 --> 09:02.642
I've got, you know, some of these movies I have.

09:02.822 --> 09:10.609
I mean, I wouldn't surprise you with what I've got, I don't think.

09:10.629 --> 09:11.169
Over here.

09:12.410 --> 09:13.752
These are the laser discs.

09:14.132 --> 09:15.893
See, here's a movie.

09:17.155 --> 09:18.796
I haven't even opened this one, cracked this one.

09:19.457 --> 09:20.518
Five Easy Pieces.

09:20.858 --> 09:21.619
Jack Nicholson.

09:21.919 --> 09:22.419
Oh, yeah.

09:23.380 --> 09:28.705
And, you know, and I've got Chinatown over there, and that's signed by the cast.

09:29.883 --> 09:33.046
That's, you know, Gallipoli, well, you wouldn't know what that was.

09:33.667 --> 09:39.474
Chips, which is, this is not a good, um, Maltese Falcon, of course.

09:40.575 --> 09:41.616
Cat and Hot Tin Roof.

09:41.856 --> 09:44.659
Steel Magnolias, which is a wonderful, wonderful movie.

09:44.679 --> 09:46.221
Yeah, that was a good movie.

09:46.301 --> 09:46.822
Oh, yeah.

09:46.842 --> 09:53.529
And then here's Chinatown, you know, Howard's Inn, some of these, Citizen Kane, of course, which was the movie.

09:55.291 --> 09:56.332
The most that were.

09:56.773 --> 09:57.173
What, what?

09:57.507 --> 10:03.234
I'm just talking a lot from my tape recorder, the monster roar in the last picture show, the lady in the lake.

10:03.875 --> 10:04.676
Hi, Sierra.

10:04.696 --> 10:06.579
That's a great book.

10:06.599 --> 10:07.380
I love some of them.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.522
The heat of the night comes in.

10:09.542 --> 10:11.405
I didn't realize... That's a difficult book to find.

10:11.525 --> 10:17.953
We'll probably have to, I think... What time are we supposed to be there?

10:18.494 --> 10:22.519
No, no, we got... I think that we really covered it, so if...

10:23.765 --> 10:31.260
I want to give you a couple of minutes to hit the john and everything here, Bill.
