00:01.567 --> 00:31.405
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, X, Y, and Z. Hey, you know A, B, C. One.

00:32.077 --> 00:32.698
Two.

00:32.718 --> 00:33.559
Three.

00:33.799 --> 00:34.561
Five.

00:34.941 --> 00:35.262
Seven.

00:35.862 --> 00:36.263
Eight.

00:36.283 --> 00:36.704
Nine.

00:36.924 --> 00:37.385
Ten.

00:37.625 --> 00:38.206
Eleven.

00:38.266 --> 00:40.129
Twelve.

00:40.149 --> 00:40.749
Nine.

00:41.390 --> 00:41.511
Eight.

00:42.091 --> 00:42.532
Seven.

00:49.923 --> 00:51.144
It's voice activated, right?

00:51.204 --> 00:51.986
Now it's going to stop.

00:52.086 --> 00:52.386
Watch.

00:54.970 --> 00:59.316
The thing is, if you keep this in your pocket, you don't have to put it on or off.

00:59.887 --> 01:06.475
If you want to do something surreptitious, but if I start talking again, it starts again.

01:06.695 --> 01:07.256
Now I stop.

01:07.296 --> 01:07.516
Watch.

01:07.816 --> 01:11.381
Have you given this to Connie?

01:11.421 --> 01:12.822
What are you doing now?

01:16.066 --> 01:17.027
What's Daddy's name?

01:23.835 --> 01:24.596
So what else?

01:26.599 --> 01:27.700
Talk to me, Barbara.

01:28.203 --> 01:29.424
I am not.

01:29.444 --> 01:30.285
Hey, look at these two.

01:31.666 --> 01:32.387
You see them?

01:32.407 --> 01:34.389
I got one on each leg.

01:34.409 --> 01:34.909
Talk to me.

01:38.733 --> 01:42.536
Barbara, say something in here to the machine.

01:42.556 --> 01:47.320
Come on, say something.

01:51.164 --> 01:52.585
Mommy!

01:53.806 --> 01:57.990
Daddy, that's what I want you to be, not me.

01:58.595 --> 02:01.599
Thank you.

02:01.619 --> 02:02.721
You like this machine, Barb?

02:07.348 --> 02:08.049
Yeah.

02:08.490 --> 02:09.291
Can I do it?

02:09.832 --> 02:10.432
It's on now.

02:11.214 --> 02:14.378
This?

02:14.398 --> 02:15.500
I use this for my work.

02:16.241 --> 02:16.481
Do?

02:16.702 --> 02:17.343
Why?

02:17.623 --> 02:18.504
I talk to people.

02:19.546 --> 02:20.027
Why?

02:20.207 --> 02:21.489
And I want to know what they say.

02:22.250 --> 02:22.330
Why?

02:22.350 --> 02:26.476
And I record it on this little machine.

02:26.496 --> 02:26.777
Daddy's a spy.

02:26.797 --> 02:27.117
He works for us.

02:27.586 --> 02:28.187
for the U.S.

02:28.327 --> 02:28.788
government.

02:29.489 --> 02:33.474
Did you read about that guy who was trying to sell?

02:33.494 --> 02:34.716
Sold to the FBI.

02:35.317 --> 02:38.782
What a jerk, huh?

02:38.802 --> 02:42.708
Good night, Nicole Beatty.

02:42.728 --> 02:43.569
Got a girl problem.

02:45.271 --> 02:45.712
Papa.

02:45.732 --> 02:45.832
Papa.

02:46.453 --> 02:48.696
Are you going to go to bed now?

02:49.297 --> 02:52.101
Can you put me down, please?

02:52.121 --> 02:53.703
I don't think so.

02:53.723 --> 02:54.384
You don't want me.

02:54.404 --> 02:55.306
Papa wants to show.

02:55.526 --> 02:56.327
Don't go.

02:58.467 --> 02:59.568
Why you got my shoes on?

03:01.951 --> 03:04.673
Those are big shoes.

03:09.799 --> 03:10.359
I don't know.

03:10.419 --> 03:13.482
You tell me.

03:13.502 --> 03:18.227
Nicole, what are you doing?

03:19.448 --> 03:20.750
Can I stay on your lap?

03:21.030 --> 03:21.390
Sure.

03:22.572 --> 03:24.133
Can you do that?

03:24.153 --> 03:24.754
Can I do what?

03:24.794 --> 03:25.875
What is this thing here?

03:26.699 --> 03:29.242
This is called what?

03:30.763 --> 03:32.305
Magnifying glass.

03:32.826 --> 03:32.946
Yeah.

03:33.426 --> 03:35.228
Now you see how it makes things big?

03:36.089 --> 03:36.970
Just look at your leg.

03:37.070 --> 03:37.511
See that?

03:37.571 --> 03:38.171
Look at your hand.

03:38.211 --> 03:40.934
Put your hand under the glass.

03:40.954 --> 03:42.136
See it?

03:42.156 --> 03:42.756
No, look.

03:42.796 --> 03:44.198
Pull your hand back so you can see it.

03:48.062 --> 03:48.262
There.

03:48.663 --> 03:49.764
What else interests you here?

03:50.405 --> 03:51.426
Can we do that?

03:51.446 --> 03:53.668
What is this thing?

03:54.830 --> 03:55.571
Do you know what that is?

03:55.611 --> 03:56.152
What?

03:56.172 --> 03:56.692
You tell me.

04:01.198 --> 04:02.379
You tell me.

04:02.399 --> 04:05.343
Well, I think we call it a tape recorder.

04:06.004 --> 04:08.627
Yeah.

04:08.967 --> 04:10.689
Can you tell me what to do?

04:11.570 --> 04:13.172
Well, it makes recordings.

04:15.215 --> 04:16.136
Can you do it?

04:16.777 --> 04:17.878
I'm doing it right now.

04:17.898 --> 04:18.699
Is?

04:19.280 --> 04:20.241
Yeah.

04:20.261 --> 04:21.022
Is it coming?

04:21.783 --> 04:21.883
Yeah.

04:23.078 --> 04:23.819
How do you feel now?

04:23.839 --> 04:25.040
Do you still have a sore throat?

04:25.761 --> 04:26.723
Yeah.

04:26.743 --> 04:27.784
Do you feel better at least?

04:27.804 --> 04:29.066
What's that?

04:29.086 --> 04:30.447
You want to play it?

04:30.467 --> 04:30.567
Yeah.

04:32.290 --> 04:33.171
Be my half.

04:33.551 --> 04:34.192
You can't what?

04:34.212 --> 04:35.113
I can't.

04:35.634 --> 04:36.675
I don't know what you're talking about.

04:36.695 --> 04:37.837
What are you talking about?

04:37.857 --> 04:39.519
This just can't be my arm.

04:40.139 --> 04:43.504
Hey, get out of there, Nicole.

04:43.524 --> 04:44.725
I have to weigh on the chair.

04:44.745 --> 04:46.047
Well, can we see what you weigh?

04:46.427 --> 04:46.948
What?

04:46.968 --> 04:47.348
I don't know.

04:47.368 --> 04:49.551
Stand on there and I'll weigh you.

04:50.152 --> 04:50.993
Nicole, please get out.

04:54.753 --> 04:55.594
All right, let's weigh you.

04:56.015 --> 04:59.499
28, 32, 36.

04:59.519 --> 04:59.799
38!

04:59.819 --> 05:05.146
38 pounds, Barbara.

05:05.166 --> 05:06.207
Yeah.

05:06.748 --> 05:09.231
How about your sister?

05:09.251 --> 05:10.172
38 pounds.

05:10.813 --> 05:12.635
Okay, let's see what nickel weighs.

05:12.655 --> 05:12.755
Yeah.

05:13.075 --> 05:13.716
Come here, nickel.

05:15.098 --> 05:15.899
Come here, nickel.

05:16.840 --> 05:19.543
Stand on the thing.

05:19.563 --> 05:19.944
Okay.

05:21.205 --> 05:21.546
Nickel.

05:21.926 --> 05:22.527
Nickel weighs.

05:22.587 --> 05:22.967
Hold it.

05:22.987 --> 05:23.528
Don't touch it.

05:24.301 --> 05:25.622
Hey, don't dance.

05:25.642 --> 05:26.323
Don't dance.

05:26.363 --> 05:28.365
We're trying to weigh it.

05:28.426 --> 05:28.906
Hey, hey, hey.

05:28.926 --> 05:32.110
Don't dance.

05:32.130 --> 05:34.572
I'm going to do right now.

05:34.592 --> 05:35.213
32 pounds.

05:36.314 --> 05:37.275
I'm going to take the duck.

05:37.295 --> 05:38.797
She's bigger than a Christmas turkey.

05:39.237 --> 05:40.999
Yeah.

05:43.362 --> 05:48.508
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

05:49.188 --> 05:49.769
Whose duck?

05:49.789 --> 05:50.730
Let Nicole have a duck.

05:51.605 --> 05:55.468
You like this room?

05:55.689 --> 05:56.209
Yeah.

05:57.470 --> 05:58.992
I do too.

05:59.012 --> 06:00.653
So, what else?

06:02.655 --> 06:03.916
Do you feel better now?

06:05.157 --> 06:06.358
Do ya?

06:10.962 --> 06:11.663
You feel better now.

06:11.683 --> 06:12.504
That's what I want to know.

06:15.466 --> 06:15.567
Yeah.

06:15.587 --> 06:16.487
Can I get down?

06:16.868 --> 06:17.628
Sure.

06:17.648 --> 06:18.469
Are we all done now?

06:19.250 --> 06:20.591
Yes, we can go now.

06:20.691 --> 06:21.612
Nicole, say something.

06:23.363 --> 06:24.324
Hey, hey.

06:25.365 --> 06:26.346
Okay, let's go downstairs.

06:28.269 --> 06:28.349
Bye.

06:31.032 --> 06:31.652
Be careful.

06:31.773 --> 06:32.513
Hey, be careful.

06:32.594 --> 06:34.316
We're upstairs now.

06:35.597 --> 06:37.639
Be careful.

06:41.604 --> 06:42.505
Okay.

06:43.306 --> 06:45.488
Why do you like to play with the dirty laundry?

06:45.508 --> 06:47.711
Well, because I really want to.

06:47.731 --> 06:48.892
You like the dirty laundry?

06:49.593 --> 06:50.254
Yeah.

06:50.274 --> 06:50.894
Well, why?

06:51.635 --> 06:53.117
Well, because...

06:53.350 --> 06:54.452
And they're messy.

06:54.952 --> 06:55.994
You like to be messy?

06:56.294 --> 06:56.414
Yeah.

06:57.957 --> 06:58.758
Should we get downstairs?

06:59.499 --> 06:59.899
Yeah.

07:00.220 --> 07:01.942
Okay, let's go turn off the lights in my room.

07:10.474 --> 07:11.115
Come on, Nickel.

07:13.038 --> 07:14.780
Let's get away from the dirty laundry.

07:14.800 --> 07:15.001
Yeah.

07:15.662 --> 07:16.242
Come on.

07:17.484 --> 07:18.025
Come on, Nickel.

07:19.527 --> 07:20.549
I'm going down.

07:20.709 --> 07:22.311
Okay, I see you.

07:23.033 --> 07:26.717
Why does your sister like the dirty laundry?

07:27.478 --> 07:29.760
Well, because... Why?

07:30.061 --> 07:31.622
Well, she do.

07:32.003 --> 07:33.284
I don't think it makes much sense.

07:33.364 --> 07:33.965
Come on, let's go.

07:34.225 --> 07:34.806
I'll hold your hand.

07:36.127 --> 07:37.469
I'm going down.

07:37.489 --> 07:40.712
Good, I got the Colby.

07:41.033 --> 07:44.176
Come on.

07:46.659 --> 07:49.762
Where are you, Barbara?

07:49.782 --> 07:50.323
Right here.

07:50.962 --> 08:03.360
There is.

08:04.622 --> 08:06.985
There's no cartoons on.

08:07.306 --> 08:12.373
Yes, there is.

08:12.393 --> 08:18.302
Don't, don't.

08:18.788 --> 08:35.153
She was playing in the dirty laundry upstairs.

08:43.465 --> 08:46.450
Nicole, do you like your mother's back, huh?

08:47.206 --> 08:54.534
She was upstairs and she was pulling her little beck and you could hear the beck and the table goes quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.

09:00.160 --> 09:06.627
Nicole, what are you doing to me?

09:06.647 --> 09:07.748
Nicole, what are you doing?

09:08.469 --> 09:11.372
You know, she doesn't climb on my back like that.

09:11.392 --> 09:15.316
Well, that's because she knows everything, too.

09:15.336 --> 09:15.576
Oh, shut up.

09:16.535 --> 09:19.019
What are you watching here?

09:19.039 --> 09:20.060
What is this?

09:20.080 --> 09:21.542
Danger Mouse.

09:21.562 --> 09:22.263
Danger Mouse?

09:22.684 --> 09:24.306
Yeah.

09:24.407 --> 09:26.490
Is this Danger Mouse?

09:31.697 --> 09:32.098
Yeah.

09:32.218 --> 09:33.640
She likes it.

09:39.849 --> 09:41.732
Danger Mouse.

09:42.387 --> 09:59.468
How did you find danger, Mom?

09:59.508 --> 10:00.850
Well, Barbara, what can you tell us?

10:04.254 --> 10:05.676
Did you want a computer for Christmas?

10:07.218 --> 10:09.621
Are you all done talking now?

10:09.641 --> 10:09.981
Yeah.

10:10.619 --> 10:12.621
Say goodbye, Mr. and Mrs. America.

10:14.283 --> 10:17.427
Say goodbye, Mr. and Mrs. America.

10:17.487 --> 10:18.188
Say it right in here.

10:18.729 --> 10:40.474
Say goodbye, Mr. and Mrs. America.

10:42.125 --> 10:53.219
Grandma.

11:01.209 --> 11:04.833
Grandma.

11:04.853 --> 11:05.013
Grandma.

11:05.034 --> 11:05.194
Grandma.

11:09.239 --> 11:11.862
Well, that's about

11:12.365 --> 11:13.569
Change a mouse.

11:13.589 --> 11:14.593
Why is?

11:15.395 --> 11:16.880
Those are his initials, DM.

11:19.409 --> 11:19.890
It's all over.

11:21.937 --> 11:22.138
And?
