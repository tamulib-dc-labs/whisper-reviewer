00:02.849 --> 00:18.947
okay the tape record is running I hope and believe you can probably hear the sounds of the city below there's a whistle it is 7 0 5 p.m.

00:19.427 --> 00:31.000
local time I'm in Alexandria Egypt it is the 27th of October 1998

00:31.486 --> 00:34.249
It is my first full day in Egypt.

00:34.329 --> 00:35.771
I spent the night here last night.

00:35.831 --> 00:43.580
I arrived on a flight from Istanbul to Alexandria, I beg your pardon, to Cairo.

00:46.203 --> 00:50.308
And that story is another one that should be told at another point at another time.

00:52.511 --> 00:56.295
But I took a limousine and we put quotes around that word limousine.

00:58.435 --> 01:09.464
From Cairo here to Alexandria last night, I wrote down the name of my driver, and boy, I do have to go and check it out because he has to be named at some point.

01:11.046 --> 01:12.147
This guy was a pistol.

01:14.689 --> 01:17.691
How fast they drive their cars, I don't know.

01:18.933 --> 01:27.700
I dared to look over his shoulder and to see something in the neighborhood of 130 and 140 miles.

01:28.372 --> 01:57.568
kilometers per hour whatever that is we were easily doing a hundred miles an hour and that's cool I certainly have driven that fast before in my life as my share of speeding tickets will attest but in Egypt there are no rules people dart out in front of your car

01:58.696 --> 02:04.643
If there were lines in the road, they're there merely as stripes of paint.

02:04.663 --> 02:09.228
You come excruciatingly close to other vehicles, to trucks.

02:09.248 --> 02:10.770
I guess you blink your lights.

02:11.911 --> 02:13.012
You beep your horn.

02:14.114 --> 02:28.450
If they curse each other, then it is through some magic individual language of their own that is not discernible to my eyes or to Western eyes.

02:29.324 --> 02:33.127
I don't see screaming flashes of anger.

02:34.389 --> 02:41.215
I did see one pedestrian get hit by a taxi today, and I don't know how serious it was.

02:41.275 --> 02:45.518
I'm looking out now as we speak at the spot where that happened.

02:45.538 --> 02:58.470
I do have to find out the name of this square, this square that faces the Eastern Harbor, where I sit now on the third floor.

02:59.277 --> 03:03.885
of my hotel room, the Metropole Hotel.

03:04.025 --> 03:17.407
It was really an inspiration, a momentary effort.

03:18.168 --> 03:23.597
The word is escaping me right now, but I did something really brilliant by calling the Egyptian Embassy.

03:25.568 --> 03:39.986
because not only did they get me this hotel, but they got me this room, they got me these people, and here I am sitting right now watching children, three children, running around a fountain in that park below.

03:40.367 --> 03:41.608
I can even hear their voices.

03:42.649 --> 03:42.990
Hear them?

03:45.153 --> 03:49.738
Here's the whistle, the taxi cab, and all this hubbub.

03:50.239 --> 03:53.323
There's a huge drink, Coca-Cola, signed in red.

03:53.383 --> 03:54.985
I took a photograph of it today.

03:56.095 --> 03:57.276
It's off to my left.

03:58.438 --> 04:01.241
That huge statue which dominates the square.

04:02.803 --> 04:05.726
Undoubtedly some notable Egyptian of recent vintage.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.588
It is by no means Ozymandias.

04:07.608 --> 04:10.571
He does have a fez on, modern dress.

04:13.475 --> 04:15.497
Looking out towards the sea.

04:15.797 --> 04:20.803
Was I ever reminded today that one does not say the word ocean here?

04:22.184 --> 04:24.507
I misspoke myself twice.

04:24.647 --> 04:25.688
I said the ocean.

04:25.809 --> 04:28.192
And they said the sea, the sea.

04:28.212 --> 04:30.795
And of course the sea out beyond those gates.

04:31.736 --> 04:33.158
And they are gates.

04:33.178 --> 04:35.581
It certainly is a welcoming entranceway.

04:37.984 --> 04:52.022
And now as I look at it, it looks like a giant U. And I'm in the middle of the bottom part of this stroke of this big U. It's a big U. It's as if you raised your two arms above your head.

04:54.803 --> 05:04.896
A big, welcoming... Hear the clop, clop, clop of those horses?

05:04.917 --> 05:09.302
A big U. It's the eastern harbor.

05:11.285 --> 05:14.870
And your arms are reaching upward, outward.

05:14.890 --> 05:20.597
The huge ancient tower of Alexandria would be up to my left.

05:20.618 --> 05:23.241
It would be up to my left, but actually as I sit...

05:24.166 --> 05:26.749
I mean, at my 12 o'clock, straight ahead.

05:27.450 --> 05:27.931
Straight ahead.

05:27.971 --> 05:30.054
The arm would sweep off to my left.

05:31.376 --> 05:39.266
The elbow would be, oh, perhaps a quarter of a mile off to the left.

05:39.366 --> 05:41.890
And then it's a long, straight arc outward.

05:42.511 --> 05:48.118
And there, now, illuminated by lights, is this castle.

05:49.039 --> 05:51.743
We must find the provenance of this castle.

05:52.263 --> 05:56.987
This castle is said to have been constructed from the rubble of the lighthouse, which once stood there.

05:59.289 --> 06:10.599
If this were 2,300 years ago, undoubtedly I would be here right now looking at this giant, this giant structure reaching into the sky.

06:12.641 --> 06:21.308
And instead of the cacophonous sounds of taxis and whistles and the cloppity-clop of horse hoops and the

06:21.862 --> 06:30.195
horns of taxi cabs and the occasional voice in an Arabic language.

06:32.378 --> 06:32.959
There you go.

06:37.245 --> 06:46.840
Instead of those, the sense of sight, instead of the sense of sound, which is what is really at work right now,

06:47.427 --> 06:49.850
in concert with this wonderful panorama.

06:49.950 --> 06:51.552
It is, in fact, a panorama.

06:54.235 --> 07:15.840
I probably would be mesmerized by the sight of this extraordinary tower, which would be climbing up into the sky, belching out smoke, fire, because this is nighttime.

07:15.860 --> 07:17.282
This is when it matters.

07:18.241 --> 07:21.845
This is when those seafarers out there need to know where they're going.

07:21.865 --> 07:34.658
And as I look off, as I see, that little camera's not going to pick up those little lights at night, but I certainly see, as an old naval officer, I know ships underway when I see them.

07:36.360 --> 07:43.087
And I do see out on the horizon the lights of vessels, of ships.

07:45.729 --> 07:46.510
Just imagine.

07:47.013 --> 08:04.139
ancient seafarers bound for Alexandria, using as their landfall that ancient, that magnificent structure, that lighthouse, the phallos, is that what they call it?

08:04.159 --> 08:05.681
Check it out.

08:05.701 --> 08:08.285
Beckoning them here, bringing them here.

08:10.108 --> 08:14.995
And here they would come, and then off to my right, and I would say,

08:16.139 --> 08:23.189
Where I sit, it's my two o'clock.

08:23.209 --> 08:24.370
Yeah, it's my two o'clock.

08:25.232 --> 08:28.436
So then my three is way ahead over here.

08:28.456 --> 08:29.478
Are a couple of vessels.

08:30.940 --> 08:32.722
Put some lights on at night.

08:32.902 --> 08:35.306
They aren't fishing, folks.

08:35.326 --> 08:44.138
But that is where archaeological expeditions are in progress to try and locate the remains of the

08:45.164 --> 08:46.826
ancient city of Alexandria.

08:46.846 --> 08:48.168
And so here I am.

08:48.188 --> 08:51.473
Here I am, sitting here.

08:51.493 --> 08:54.617
And yet, Chef Louis, he said I should come here and feel the magic.

08:54.758 --> 08:55.699
I'm feeling it now.

08:56.780 --> 08:58.443
I didn't feel it earlier today.

08:59.865 --> 09:04.852
What I felt was the heat more than anything else.

09:04.872 --> 09:14.766
As I walked down that promenade, and that's, I guess, what it is, this promenade that goes along the harbor and carries you all the way in here.

09:16.366 --> 09:36.886
to catch this sight where I sit at the moment and see these women in Arab clothing, white headdresses, scarfs over their heads.

09:38.287 --> 09:41.551
And they're all gathered here at this square.

09:41.571 --> 09:46.035
And there is a huge drink Coca-Cola sign

09:46.285 --> 09:48.668
right to the left of the Cecil Hotel.

09:52.673 --> 09:56.238
I guess that would be quite a collectible thing, that drink Coca-Cola.

09:56.258 --> 09:58.941
There is the original Coca-Cola.

09:58.961 --> 10:14.741
I don't even know if we see any of those like that in the States, but that's not great.

10:14.761 --> 10:15.001
Here we are.

10:15.021 --> 10:15.702
The sound of it.

10:16.677 --> 10:44.997
hoinking streetcar and again this is from my room do you believe that among these little plastic advertisements dioramas whatever you want to call them McDonald's seems to have cornered the market here I see a few of these in yellow plastic plates in Arabic of other

10:46.394 --> 10:51.419
advertising other wares, other businesses, other whatever, commercial venues.

10:51.439 --> 10:55.183
But for McDonald's, I can count.

10:56.284 --> 10:58.827
One, two, three, four.

10:59.888 --> 11:03.472
The fifth is a large one, much larger than the others.

11:03.532 --> 11:05.313
Five, that's five, six.

11:05.994 --> 11:12.621
So six out of a total of one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

11:12.922 --> 11:16.648
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

11:16.668 --> 11:22.097
18, one third of these belong to McDonald's.

11:23.619 --> 11:24.721
God bless America.

11:24.741 --> 11:27.566
Hey, why the hell not?

11:28.808 --> 11:34.457
The children are running again around their pool of water.

11:36.080 --> 11:37.562
This is really fascinating.

11:42.031 --> 11:43.673
Boy, I hope you've taken all this up.

11:46.457 --> 12:02.300
And when we think of the nature of this project, of what I'm working on, of what I'm writing, and we think of the preservation of manuscripts, of tapes, of thought, of idea, the preservation of the transmission.

12:04.764 --> 12:07.368
Well, this is a nice little exercise I'm doing now.

12:08.289 --> 12:08.950
Maybe.

12:09.503 --> 12:14.830
And I underscore maybe, maybe I'll listen to this tape before I write the book.

12:14.850 --> 12:20.799
I hope I do, because I think I have good thoughts here, some good vibrations.

12:20.819 --> 12:24.985
But you know, maybe I will, and maybe I won't.

12:25.005 --> 12:30.673
And if I don't... And here we are on October 27, 1998.

12:30.793 --> 12:36.000
I'm 55 years old, working on this book.

12:38.917 --> 12:40.980
Maybe these tapes are important.

12:41.000 --> 12:41.781
I hope they are.

12:42.682 --> 12:43.523
Maybe they're not.

12:45.445 --> 12:47.287
Will anyone ever listen to this?

12:47.908 --> 12:55.537
Boy, if you do... Hey, maybe I'll be around and alive.

12:56.479 --> 12:57.560
That would be kind of cool.

12:57.880 --> 12:59.943
If I am, check it out, whoever you are.

13:00.724 --> 13:01.645
Get in touch with me.

13:02.206 --> 13:04.108
If I still have my wits and my thoughts.

13:06.611 --> 13:08.333
And my arteries haven't clogged.

13:11.350 --> 13:27.204
And my concern extends beyond whatever it is I might be having for lunch that day, whether I have had a good nap.

13:27.265 --> 13:29.186
We have a disease called Alzheimer's.

13:30.387 --> 13:30.988
Who knows?

13:32.009 --> 13:33.210
Or if it's even beyond that.

13:33.330 --> 13:34.751
I'm croaked, I'm dead.

13:34.811 --> 13:38.775
Croaked is a great word in the parlance of today, somebody who died.

13:40.510 --> 13:43.233
Will this little tape survive as a message in a bottle?

13:44.855 --> 13:46.937
Will somebody listen to it?

13:46.957 --> 13:47.637
Will it matter?

13:48.799 --> 13:49.599
Does it matter?

13:52.262 --> 13:52.983
Write it down.

13:54.144 --> 13:55.265
October 27th, 1998.

13:55.526 --> 14:00.951
Are you yelling a blowing whistle?

14:00.971 --> 14:02.913
Is someone else beeping a horn?

14:07.578 --> 14:08.099
You can hear it.

14:09.280 --> 14:09.420
I hope.

14:12.826 --> 14:18.294
The sound of the city, the sound of A-City, the city named for Alexander the Great.

14:20.937 --> 14:38.161
And here I am, perhaps, perhaps, perhaps, near the site of the ancient library, for sure, on this site, you know, take a pic, it was.

14:38.182 --> 14:42.107
But if I were at this spot, on this site, here,

14:43.623 --> 15:12.313
2300 years ago there's no doubt there is absolutely no doubt that I would have seen and I would have in my sight right now that library so that's it and from here it's on to Greece Nick Bazbaines this is Nicholas A. Bazbaines I didn't give you my name my goodness my god

15:14.521 --> 15:18.745
You know, I was assuming all along that this tape would be preserved with all the others.

15:20.527 --> 15:21.528
Let's hope that happens.

15:22.108 --> 15:22.849
What if it doesn't?

15:24.010 --> 15:25.111
What if it doesn't?

15:25.672 --> 15:27.814
What if it's a tape?

15:27.834 --> 15:29.996
Listen, I have to confess something now.

15:30.116 --> 15:31.958
I was at Pergamum three days ago.

15:31.978 --> 15:36.061
Pergamum, the ancient library, the rival library.

15:39.124 --> 15:40.866
To the Alexandrian library.

15:41.656 --> 15:45.640
Well, there, not only do we know precisely where it was, the site is there.

15:49.243 --> 15:49.764
It's marked.

15:49.804 --> 15:50.985
I was in a reading room.

15:51.866 --> 15:53.187
I took photographs.

15:54.368 --> 15:58.332
And as I wrote about 20 minutes ago before I started this tape, I felt the buzz.

15:58.472 --> 15:59.292
Go to my book.

15:59.553 --> 16:00.934
The book is not titled yet.

16:01.975 --> 16:06.820
But whoever you are listening to this, go to that book.

16:07.620 --> 16:10.583
This companion volume to A Gentle Madness.

16:11.221 --> 16:39.321
go to that book I suspect that I will begin on the hills on that mountain in Pergamum and I suspect also that I will conclude right here in Alexandria so while I was there taking photographs getting these impressions working on this theme on these thoughts alright spit it out

16:39.503 --> 16:40.745
I took a piece of marble.

16:41.146 --> 16:42.268
I kneeled down.

16:42.368 --> 16:53.807
There it was, a piece of wonderful marble within the perimeter, in the space, the sacred space of this ancient library.

16:53.867 --> 16:55.590
I had to have this piece of marble.

16:57.854 --> 16:58.695
And I picked that up.

16:59.096 --> 17:02.782
You know, I am not a scavenger.

17:02.802 --> 17:03.142
I am not a thief.

17:03.162 --> 17:03.503
I am not a thief.

17:04.478 --> 17:07.921
There was a lot of marble there.

17:08.261 --> 17:09.983
There's still a lot of marble there.

17:12.485 --> 17:15.968
But I took this piece of marble to inspire me.

17:18.150 --> 17:24.615
And there's a kind of talisman connection with that ancient structure.

17:26.557 --> 17:33.743
And there was no such similar object to be found to my liking here today.

17:34.212 --> 17:46.530
And I think that what matters here is not the object, the piece of marble, but this experience right here, this sitting.

17:46.550 --> 17:56.525
And I'm going to attempt a photograph, a nighttime photograph of this scene, because not only should it be heard, it should also be seen.

17:58.628 --> 18:01.112
Because here I am.

18:01.132 --> 18:02.734
Well, okay, dear listener.

18:03.710 --> 18:08.517
In the old days, they would say, Dear reader, you are the dear listener.

18:11.021 --> 18:18.151
Listen, if you listen to this, listen, if you listen to this, check me out, will you?

18:21.817 --> 18:25.081
I lived in Massachusetts for most of my life.

18:25.101 --> 18:28.386
I wrote a book that a lot of people liked called A Gentle Madness.

18:30.449 --> 18:31.050
And now...

18:32.279 --> 18:32.920
I believe.

18:33.260 --> 18:34.201
I think I've reached it.

18:35.662 --> 18:39.925
From here I go to Mount Athos in Greece where I'll spend five days.

18:39.965 --> 18:41.427
That's going to be very interesting.

18:42.368 --> 18:46.671
And that will be in this new book.

18:46.691 --> 18:49.153
And who knows, it may surpass us.

18:49.894 --> 18:50.434
It may not.

18:51.295 --> 18:53.237
You never want to rule out anything.

18:55.198 --> 18:56.740
But if I'm around, give me a call.

18:57.700 --> 18:58.361
Get in touch.

18:58.741 --> 18:59.602
Write me a letter.

19:00.643 --> 19:01.864
I have two daughters.

19:03.143 --> 19:09.250
Barbara G. George Berger Bazbaines, Nicole Stella Bazbaines, my wife is funny.

19:10.431 --> 19:12.614
If I'm cloaked, get in touch with them.

19:12.974 --> 19:18.560
Say, listen, I heard your dad's tape.

19:18.640 --> 19:19.702
Tell him what you thought of it.

19:21.003 --> 19:25.208
Come around, and I was more successful than I thought I'd be.

19:27.270 --> 19:29.893
Successful in the same thing doing what I set out to do.

19:31.122 --> 19:32.364
Okay, I'm signing off.

19:32.424 --> 19:33.265
Hey, this is cool.

19:33.746 --> 19:34.106
Gas.

19:35.548 --> 19:37.391
I'm going to go get myself a bite to eat.

19:37.411 --> 19:40.034
Get a ticket on the Torbino to Cairo.

19:41.656 --> 19:44.420
And then it's off to Greece in Mount Athos.

19:45.341 --> 19:48.085
Nick Fasbane saying this has been wonderful.

19:49.367 --> 19:50.689
And signing off right now.

19:50.709 --> 19:54.834
Thank you.

19:54.854 --> 20:00.522
It's about ten minutes later and I've decided to come back on again because I hear more sounds and

20:02.560 --> 20:04.163
I just want to pick up these sounds.

20:08.631 --> 20:13.620
This is really a new experience for me and I guess it's been coming on over the last couple of days.

20:14.501 --> 20:21.514
Normally I go out into the field and I take voluminous notes, I interview people, I take

20:22.574 --> 20:27.139
Dozens of photographs, of which only a few are really any good, but I like it.

20:27.420 --> 20:35.569
I like to cover my sixes, as the fighter pilots used to say, which means to cover your ass, your six being the opposite of your twelve.

20:38.873 --> 20:40.415
But this trip, it's been sounds.

20:40.615 --> 20:50.286
When I was in Pergamum, standing up there on the hill, a thousand feet up there, you could hear

20:50.789 --> 20:51.430
to the left.

20:51.490 --> 20:54.174
You could hear from right in front of you.

20:54.194 --> 20:55.355
You could hear from the right.

20:55.415 --> 20:57.358
You could hear an occasional horn.

21:01.003 --> 21:09.434
When the Muslims start calling their faithful to prayers, that sound just whiffs up from below.

21:09.474 --> 21:12.158
And you hear that sound.

21:12.218 --> 21:15.622
In Ephesus, it was even more extraordinary.

21:15.702 --> 21:17.825
When I was up there on the hill at St.

21:17.885 --> 21:18.366
John's,

21:19.578 --> 21:21.000
And that really breaks me up.

21:21.480 --> 21:27.548
I said, well, I'll just take my camera, take a few pictures, and I left the tape recorder.

21:27.809 --> 21:34.197
Oh, I'm going to kill myself for missing that, as the sounds came from everywhere.

21:35.899 --> 21:46.873
I don't mean to demean it at all, and I'm trying to just kind of make a connection with the sound of calling people to prayer.

21:47.053 --> 21:48.235
It was remarkable.

21:49.092 --> 21:50.314
And here we have sound.

21:50.354 --> 21:51.055
We have sound.

21:51.075 --> 22:05.496
You've got to use, as a writer, as a journalist, as a person who feels, and we use that verb feel to embrace all of the senses, you know, what you see, what you hear.

22:05.556 --> 22:10.703
To a journalist, are the most important things.

22:11.805 --> 22:13.928
What you see and what you hear, what you feel.

22:14.008 --> 22:16.011
But here, in terms of what people say,

22:16.936 --> 22:18.097
Not to the sounds.

22:21.120 --> 22:24.604
The sounds that make up a universe, I guess.

22:28.488 --> 22:29.449
A civilization.

22:32.291 --> 22:34.113
These are random beeps of horns.

22:34.333 --> 22:36.476
Random beeping horns.

22:36.496 --> 22:37.677
Not much of a title there.

22:40.780 --> 22:42.802
But something's coming.

22:42.822 --> 22:43.563
And here we are.

22:43.603 --> 22:46.926
In a big old puddle of water.

22:48.340 --> 22:55.809
Those arms, those big raised arms, like a giant U reaching outward to the Mediterranean Sea.

22:57.151 --> 22:59.153
And off to the left would have been that lighthouse.

23:03.739 --> 23:04.400
Something, baby.

23:05.060 --> 23:06.182
Really something.

23:06.202 --> 23:08.345
Okay, sign-off time once more.

23:10.387 --> 23:15.293
An addendum note, just because I'll be kicking myself in the ass to get it.

23:15.880 --> 23:23.768
The drink Coca-Cola sign is on the roof of what appears to be the Acropoli Hotel.

23:24.870 --> 23:31.076
And we spell that A-C-R-O-P-O-L-E.

23:31.396 --> 23:33.319
Acropoli, like in Acropolis.

23:33.499 --> 23:35.221
Acropoli Hotel.

23:36.802 --> 23:39.986
And from where I sit, that is to the left of the Cecil.

23:40.106 --> 23:41.627
C-E-C-I-L.

23:41.747 --> 23:42.688
Cecil Hotel.

23:42.749 --> 23:44.190
And I'm in a metropole.

23:44.310 --> 23:45.111
Metropole.

23:47.099 --> 23:47.780
Hotel.

23:49.422 --> 23:50.664
And Paradise Bar.

23:51.345 --> 23:52.267
Lest we forget.

23:52.727 --> 23:53.929
Beep.

23:55.371 --> 23:55.692
Okay.

23:57.234 --> 23:58.115
Addendum next.

24:00.279 --> 24:06.768
Yes, my senses have been loosened up a bit by that traveling man's great companion, John Dewar.

24:08.010 --> 24:09.573
And this is an Arab country.

24:09.993 --> 24:11.495
And I have a mini bar.

24:13.779 --> 24:14.620
Hmm.

24:14.640 --> 24:15.441
I smell something.

24:16.142 --> 24:16.583
Wow.

24:17.727 --> 24:20.910
Something's cooking out there, folks.

24:22.231 --> 24:26.776
It kind of smells like popcorn, but I can't believe they have popcorn here in Alexandria.

24:27.337 --> 24:29.058
It's charcoal, definitely.

24:29.118 --> 24:29.879
Good.

24:29.899 --> 24:30.540
Oh, nice.

24:31.341 --> 24:32.722
Mini bar.

24:32.742 --> 24:33.182
Oh, yeah.

24:33.303 --> 24:36.806
Well, in my mini bar, we have non-alcoholic beers.

24:37.707 --> 24:39.789
You can't get a drink here to bust your ass.

24:39.889 --> 24:41.671
I mean, it's tough.

24:41.691 --> 24:43.853
So, thankfully, I did bring a jug with me.

24:44.322 --> 24:49.589
It's not John Doerr, but it is Valentine, and I just finished it off, and it has helped me here tonight.

24:50.870 --> 24:56.097
A little bit, you know, a little balm for the soul, a little loosener-upper.

24:56.177 --> 24:58.580
Something to have to un-glib the goodness.

25:01.684 --> 25:03.266
And I think I probably said more than I ought to.

25:03.746 --> 25:04.567
All right, see you.

25:04.587 --> 25:04.928
Bye-bye.

25:06.870 --> 25:07.711
Another addendum.

25:08.232 --> 25:09.874
I'd like to say the final one.

25:11.120 --> 25:12.701
But one never knows, do one.

25:12.742 --> 25:19.087
I think it's very important to the setting.

25:19.928 --> 25:25.593
I described where I am and I gave you the time and the date.

25:26.154 --> 25:28.536
I don't know if I gave you the time, but it is nighttime.

25:29.597 --> 25:30.438
It is nighttime.

25:31.099 --> 25:34.682
The photographs I took today were in piercing daylight.

25:35.683 --> 25:37.504
And here we are in nighttime.

25:37.524 --> 25:39.186
And so the water is black.

25:40.347 --> 26:02.524
the the little the arms of whatever we call these perimeters of the harbor which stretch out above our head here going out towards this U are pierced by lights yellowish lights street lights whatever

26:03.888 --> 26:05.630
And the water is just black.

26:06.752 --> 26:17.925
It must have been apparent in what I said because I think I did indicate I could see the ships way out there on the horizon as I can still see them with just their little lights blinking away.

26:19.067 --> 26:28.258
And the old seaman's eye is not as good as it used to be, but I would estimate, oh, 10 miles, 10 miles on the horizon.

26:30.521 --> 26:33.304
And there was kind of a searchlight doing a little sweep

26:33.723 --> 26:41.994
A little sweep right to left, coming my way, approximately where the ancient lighthouse would be.

26:44.017 --> 26:48.062
I think the ancient lighthouse would be far more dramatic.

26:48.082 --> 26:53.729
But this one does the job, I suppose, and we have Moran and we have satellite fixes.

26:53.749 --> 27:00.278
We have all kinds of other ways to determine location, direction.

27:01.720 --> 27:03.342
I wish we had them for people.

27:04.823 --> 27:07.545
Nick out once more.

27:07.585 --> 27:17.634
You know, as I sit here, I'm reminded of Prospero's epilogue in The Tempests.

27:19.896 --> 27:21.718
Our revels now are ended.

27:21.738 --> 27:30.226
These are actors, as I foretold you, are all spirits and are melted into air, into thin air.

27:31.427 --> 27:34.189
And like the baseless fabric of our vision,

27:35.266 --> 28:04.648
the cloud-capped towers the gorgeous temples boy i missed a phrase here but yea the great globe itself are melted and are vanished into thin air we are but stuff as dreams are made of and our little life is rounded with the sleep well i that up i think in a huge way and that is not the epilogue that's prosperous

28:04.848 --> 28:07.451
our rebels now, our ended speech.

28:07.471 --> 28:11.515
He epilogues like something else.

28:11.535 --> 28:14.418
Um, but that's pretty good too.

28:14.438 --> 28:15.779
That's where he begs forgiveness.

28:15.939 --> 28:28.552
And he said, as you from crimes would pardon me, may your indulgence set me free.

28:28.572 --> 28:28.993
Hmm.

28:29.013 --> 28:31.315
I love that too.

28:31.335 --> 28:32.536
This is very important.

28:33.057 --> 28:33.117
Um,

28:36.050 --> 28:41.056
I'm in room 312 of the Metropole Hotel.

28:42.498 --> 28:56.053
And I say it's important because of all the hotels, for all the hotels I've stayed in over the years, I've been a writer and a journalist and a researcher, I've always felt that you retain important information.

28:56.114 --> 29:05.905
And if you're really good, you retain it forever, you know, for as long as your brain functions to be that extraordinary

29:07.943 --> 29:35.166
an effably perfect machine that it is but i know one thing that's helped me get along is that well for as long as i'm in a hotel room in any city in any state in any country of the world well i know i remember the number just as i mentioned a few seconds ago room 312 well i know it's room 312

29:36.209 --> 29:40.936
What room was I in in the Astor Hotel in Athens a week ago?

29:41.016 --> 29:42.678
I don't have a clue.

29:42.698 --> 29:46.284
What's the number of the hotel I was in in Izmir?

29:48.146 --> 29:50.850
That was just yesterday morning when I checked out.

29:50.870 --> 29:52.032
Well, yeah, I do remember that.

29:52.112 --> 29:54.756
That was 1310, because it's still pretty close.

29:55.938 --> 29:57.660
That's still within 24 hours.

29:58.101 --> 30:00.945
I just really tried hard to remember.

30:00.965 --> 30:02.267
Well, here comes an ambulance.

30:02.787 --> 30:05.210
It becomes the sound of someone else's misery.

30:12.718 --> 30:14.500
Someone is having a very bad day.

30:19.405 --> 30:21.007
And so we think about that person.

30:21.027 --> 30:30.318
Yeah, well, I think being in room 312 is pertinent to this colloquy monologue.

30:30.498 --> 30:31.579
It's not a colloquy.

30:32.538 --> 30:39.244
Because I just looked down to the ground, and when I look at the photograph, I'm right above the street light.

30:39.945 --> 30:43.608
There's only one street light in front of the Metropole Hotel.

30:44.449 --> 30:48.032
And above the awning, I go up three levels.

30:48.372 --> 30:49.854
One, two, three.

30:51.135 --> 30:54.017
When you see the photograph, all of these shutters will be closed.

30:55.199 --> 30:59.743
But now my end is open, and I'll bet it's the only one in the whole hotel is open.

30:59.783 --> 31:02.325
It's open at the moment, looking out on this.

31:02.947 --> 31:28.296
a good air conditioning system you close the inner doors and and you essentially shut out these sounds and you shut out that heat although it's not hot now in fact there's a nice mediterranean breeze kind of floating in through the open arms of that big giant view out there and it's quite comfortable and quite nice

31:29.592 --> 31:35.823
It is now 8 p.m., or approximately so, five minutes prior to that hour.

31:38.367 --> 31:47.342
And this is where I am, room 312, Metropole Hotel in Alexandria.

31:49.486 --> 31:50.908
Quite a very interesting night.
