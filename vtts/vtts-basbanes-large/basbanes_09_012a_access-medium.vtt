WEBVTT

00:02.444 --> 00:07.969
If you don't mind, we're running.

00:09.231 --> 00:10.272
Ben, Budsport.

00:12.974 --> 00:19.981
How do you deal with people who suggest that you're doing a number on the claims?

00:20.242 --> 00:21.663
Well, you know, it's a good question.

00:21.683 --> 00:28.890
I, um... Right, which I thought was very unfair.

00:29.478 --> 00:40.592
You know, I pondered this before it came out and really even before I embarked on the story, although, as you know, the circumstances changed as I was working on this.

00:40.813 --> 00:50.565
And, you know, I keep coming back to what I think is a philosophy I've had that's been tested many times, and that is you can never predict what the impact of information will be.

00:51.687 --> 00:58.135
And I just have to believe that the truth serves society's interests and that knowledge

00:58.688 --> 01:04.416
serves everyone's interest, and how people react to that is out of my control.

01:05.057 --> 01:10.065
But it's essential in a democracy that we have informed citizenry.

01:10.606 --> 01:11.928
I think these are legitimate questions.

01:11.988 --> 01:13.991
I've tried to answer them in a non-partisan way.

01:14.431 --> 01:16.174
And really, it wasn't my fault.

01:16.194 --> 01:20.640
You know, whether they're good for the Clintons or bad for the Clintons, that's up for readers to decide.

01:20.660 --> 01:23.785
Well, of course, there is perception in it, especially when I...

01:24.659 --> 01:28.103
And I don't mean to discuss somebody else's review, and I won't.

01:28.203 --> 01:28.744
No, that's okay.

01:28.764 --> 01:29.164
I don't mind.

01:29.184 --> 01:36.733
But hers does come to mind, as she suggests, for instance, that you don't have any smoking crystals and nothing moves your report.

01:36.753 --> 01:40.617
Well, you know, I'm being attacked from both sides of the political spectrum.

01:40.637 --> 01:45.903
Of course, you have Tom Powers' review in the Sunday Times, which is... Certainly.

01:45.943 --> 01:50.869
I can tell immediately from a review how someone feels about the plaintiffs.

01:51.237 --> 01:53.039
And that's okay.

01:53.119 --> 01:56.744
But the people who generally like the Clintons are saying, well, there's no smoking gun.

01:57.765 --> 01:59.067
It's true there's no smoking gun.

01:59.207 --> 02:00.729
The White House has said there's no smoking gun.

02:01.209 --> 02:04.614
But to me, that's hardly the end of the discussion, in my view.

02:05.194 --> 02:08.959
How many smoking guns are there in life outside of mystery novels?

02:09.079 --> 02:09.880
There aren't that many.

02:10.081 --> 02:11.622
Life is not made up of smoking guns.

02:11.642 --> 02:20.113
And frankly, I think our political culture has reached a sorry point if all we want to talk about is, is there a smoking gun or not?

02:21.106 --> 02:25.030
Could you turn the volume down on that just a little bit?

02:27.213 --> 02:28.414
Chance to check it.

02:28.534 --> 02:30.937
Okay, so I'm sorry, we're talking about smoking guns, I guess.

02:31.217 --> 02:32.359
Right, so you know, so what?

02:32.479 --> 02:45.593
My view is, well, you know, again, given that I was invited to undertake this project by the Clintons, who said they had nothing to hide, I didn't go into this looking for a smoking gun, and I didn't think it would be a good story because there was or wasn't a smoking gun.

02:47.816 --> 02:49.898
That's to an interesting point.

02:50.637 --> 02:58.385
point that the fact that you were invited by people, and then you had this long session with Hillary that you discussed, too.

02:58.405 --> 03:05.532
Would the book have been dramatically different had the Clintons chosen to cooperate with you?

03:05.813 --> 03:08.155
I think it would have been different, certainly.

03:08.916 --> 03:14.121
I mean, I know that I, as a journalist, I mean, say, I'm going to do the story with you to help but without it.

03:14.242 --> 03:14.842
Yeah, exactly.

03:14.982 --> 03:15.223
Right.

03:15.243 --> 03:17.345
You know, help me or hinder me, I plan to get it.

03:17.705 --> 03:17.965
Right.

03:17.985 --> 03:19.547
And I suspect that this was probably

03:20.033 --> 03:31.885
That was my approach, and I told the Clintons that would be my approach, but I said, realistically, a work and the structure of a work is shaped inevitably by the information that you get.

03:32.805 --> 03:40.833
And I said, I believe it would be in your interest to share as much information as you have with me as soon as possible.

03:41.614 --> 03:49.922
Those are the sources in a story who end up having the most influence, not because you want to favor a source or something, but it's just a practical reality.

03:50.189 --> 03:56.074
a story and the sort of outline of a book begins to take shape in your mind as you learn information.

03:56.195 --> 03:59.938
And so that somebody who cooperates with you early has more of an influence.

03:59.958 --> 04:04.642
He's somebody who waits until the manuscript is essentially written and then says, well, I'll respond to specific charges.

04:05.283 --> 04:07.525
Or even after it comes out, which is even more appreciated.

04:07.545 --> 04:08.586
Which is even more appreciated.

04:09.026 --> 04:12.630
And I think what would have happened is you would have understood the Clintons better, I think.

04:12.750 --> 04:17.694
Although, you know, again, the good thing is that it forced me to do a thorough reporting job.

04:17.714 --> 04:19.316
I'd like to think I would have done that anyway.

04:19.396 --> 04:19.656
But

04:20.497 --> 04:32.354
Again, I know that when someone cooperates a great deal, you don't necessarily double-check everything they tell you, just out of practical time constraints.

04:33.215 --> 04:39.904
I think I still would have found the basic material that I found, but it would have been in a different and broader context.

04:40.405 --> 04:49.778
Let's say, obviously, you didn't find the smoking that, and then you find out very few smoking that exist in most stories.

04:50.146 --> 04:51.748
But what would the smoking then be?

04:52.029 --> 04:53.351
What would you like to have found?

04:53.371 --> 04:58.178
Well, I wasn't looking to derail the Clintons or exonerate them.

04:58.198 --> 04:58.979
I wasn't looking for it.

04:58.999 --> 05:07.691
But I think what I did find, and this is why it was probably... Well, what remains, what in your view then remains to be discovered that would really be printed one way or the other?

05:08.132 --> 05:13.800
Well, I outline a number of areas that I think still need to be resolved factually to go to questions of legal or illegal behavior.

05:13.820 --> 05:14.601
I think some of the more...

05:14.935 --> 05:25.653
Serious ones include what did Mrs. Clinton do in this Casagrande transaction that she first denied knowing anything about, but then the billing records surfaced showing extensive involvement on her part.

05:26.654 --> 05:40.858
And I think probably the most serious issue in this whole story has been the question of honesty, in some cases in replying to questions under oath, but there's a long series of

05:41.395 --> 05:52.786
as I put it in the book, that certain, you know, relatively small misstatements took root, and then the myths grew up around them, and then it had to be supported by sort of ever more preposterous explanations.

05:53.767 --> 05:59.833
But I think it is a sort of, you know, not a very flattering trail of dishonesty.

06:04.498 --> 06:06.880
But, you know, again, I think...

06:07.535 --> 06:21.904
One of the reasons that it may have been impossible for them to be candid with me, once I got to a certain point, was that it would have required acknowledging that so many misstatements were made, public misstatements were made, and I think they're in a political situation where they can't do that.

06:22.305 --> 06:29.239
I think a lot of people, myself and public, feel that as

06:29.506 --> 06:32.750
political scandals go, this is not a tent, you know?

06:33.150 --> 06:50.632
Yeah, I mean, Whitewater itself doesn't, you know... And when you look at this, we were talking about in 78, you know, I would have to believe that an overwhelming opinion is, you know, what is this?

06:50.652 --> 06:53.235
What makes this story so...

06:53.502 --> 06:59.570
Well, part of why it's such a big deal is illustrated in the book.

06:59.670 --> 07:09.464
I mean, one of the reasons that I call it blood sport is that, to me, I was primarily interested in Whitewater, and this is from the beginning, but again, I didn't expect it to be a major scandal.

07:10.225 --> 07:18.396
It turned out to be somewhat more troubling than I actually anticipated, but I saw Whitewater as a window into the political culture of our times.

07:18.747 --> 07:21.270
So you see the participants on all sides of the issue.

07:21.430 --> 07:22.611
It's not just about the Clintons.

07:22.631 --> 07:24.774
It's about the media and how they deal with them.

07:24.834 --> 07:27.216
It's about their opponents in Congress and elsewhere.

07:27.396 --> 07:33.803
It's about conservative think tanks and the people that are produced by that and the influence they've had on the public debate.

07:34.284 --> 07:40.711
So a lot of the reason that this has been perpetuated is through the adversaries of the Clintons.

07:40.731 --> 07:42.833
That's why I call it the president and his adversaries.

07:42.873 --> 07:48.079
The ammunition in this blood sport that rages on to this day

07:48.160 --> 07:51.305
However, I believe it's falsehoods, falsehoods on both sides.

07:51.345 --> 08:00.738
The Clintons have said things that are wrong, and certainly, as you see quite vividly illustrated in the book, their adversaries have said some preposterous things that are completely false.

08:01.720 --> 08:06.186
There isn't any respect for the truth in the political culture, and I think that is, at the core,

08:06.436 --> 08:08.138
why this is a blood sport.

08:08.559 --> 08:13.144
Is it a 90s story or is it endemic to politics as we've always known?

08:13.164 --> 08:15.447
Well, it's a 90s story because it's happening in the 90s.

08:15.527 --> 08:19.152
And, you know, I guess I'm not a historian and I haven't done a lot of reporting in Washington.

08:19.172 --> 08:22.596
I think the question is, is it any worse than it has been before?

08:22.616 --> 08:29.104
I know I can't answer that question, but I do know that I think that it's one of the reasons that so many people in this country are so jaded and cynical.

08:29.124 --> 08:31.627
They don't believe anything they hear from anyone in Washington.

08:31.647 --> 08:33.810
And they're frustrated by that.

08:33.870 --> 08:35.312
This isn't a partisan issue.

08:35.697 --> 08:46.728
It is for maybe the 10% of the population that's liberal to the core, conservative to the core, but for the 80% in between, they're disgusted by this kind of behavior.

08:47.188 --> 08:48.189
Of course, I go back.

08:48.670 --> 09:03.865
I spent a year in Washington back in the 60s doing some research that made my master's at a fellowship of the Washington Buildings, and I spent a whole year following the Bobby Baker story, which up until that time was quintessential

09:04.148 --> 09:15.947
political scandal, you know, and you talk about lies and deception, and there was LBJ and all of them, and of course, that was a big story up until Watergate, which then came out in the 70s.

09:16.067 --> 09:19.513
We've always seemed to have had one, haven't we?

09:19.533 --> 09:24.521
Then we had the Iran matter in the 80s, so every decade seems to have one.

09:24.781 --> 09:29.008
You go back to the 50s, you have the Icuna coat thing, and you can't

09:29.495 --> 09:31.458
Jimmy Carter didn't really have one.

09:31.618 --> 09:34.041
He was only one term.

09:34.081 --> 09:39.728
He had the peanut warehouse issue, which we quickly discussed, and the brother, but he didn't really have one.

09:40.810 --> 09:49.381
Well, people are jaded, and they're prepared to believe the worst, which is why the conspiracy theorists have had such a field day with the Clintons and certainly with the death of Vincent Foster.

09:50.062 --> 09:57.932
I think that we have seen in this period, the 60s were still the era of political figures as mythical heroes.

09:58.250 --> 10:00.032
And the press collaborated in that.

10:00.112 --> 10:02.816
I mean, they knew so much that they never reported.

10:02.896 --> 10:05.839
That was a central element in my thesis.

10:05.859 --> 10:11.487
The relationship was so symbiotic that the guys on the Hill depended so much on the press.

10:11.507 --> 10:12.908
Everybody could see Bobby Baker.

10:12.928 --> 10:20.678
They knew that the most he ever made was 19 grand, and he owned these two wonderful motels at thousands of dollars, lived vast, and where the hell was the money?

10:20.698 --> 10:21.459
And people closed their eyes.

10:21.479 --> 10:25.224
And closed their eyes, and all the press went out as his guests to a weekend, you know?

10:25.744 --> 10:27.126
Never reported.

10:27.562 --> 10:46.472
But there has been a democratization of the media, and it's partly because the media has proliferated, and it's not just, as this story makes clear, it's not just the so-called mainstream established outlets like the Washington Post and NBC News that are controlling perceptions out there.

10:46.512 --> 10:54.345
There's all this alternative media that is spewing what people want to hear, whether the high priests and the gatekeepers of

10:54.595 --> 10:56.037
information agree or not.

10:56.258 --> 10:58.221
Society has changed dramatically in that sense.

10:58.281 --> 11:00.805
And the political culture hasn't adapted to that.

11:00.845 --> 11:11.642
I think, you know, the White House is still busy spinning the myths, creating the illusions, and the expectation that the electorate cannot handle the sort of unvarnished truth.

11:11.703 --> 11:13.626
And yet the electorate is becoming sophisticated.

11:13.706 --> 11:17.071
It absorbed the story of Bill Clinton's draft situation.

11:17.091 --> 11:18.814
It swallowed Jennifer Flowers.

11:19.385 --> 11:27.843
I think it probably would have been able to evaluate the unvarnished facts of Whitewater as well, but clearly the Clintons felt that that was a risk they couldn't take.

11:28.985 --> 11:32.432
Well, that still remains to be seen whether or not they can, don't you think?

11:33.239 --> 11:36.463
I suppose the end will be the results of the November election.

11:36.943 --> 11:41.889
I can't help but notice that Clinton's popularity ratings are quite high right now.

11:42.409 --> 11:42.669
They're high.

11:42.690 --> 11:53.582
Even in the immediate aftermath of these very damaging revelations of the billing records and documents being discovered that contradict the official line, I think the First Lady's approval ratings are down.

11:53.662 --> 11:59.348
Very interesting piece of it was in the New York Times Review Review.

11:59.817 --> 12:03.601
You know, the election may well go on the wives.

12:03.621 --> 12:04.662
Did you see that piece?

12:04.682 --> 12:05.563
I didn't see that.

12:05.623 --> 12:09.907
He's Elizabeth Dole, a very active wife, you know.

12:09.927 --> 12:10.048
Right.

12:10.108 --> 12:13.011
She's certainly been more politically involved than Hillary.

12:13.031 --> 12:18.817
She had a couple of categories, but standing back here, and now Hillary is the issue on the other side.

12:18.937 --> 12:20.478
It was on the Weekend Reviews.

12:20.639 --> 12:23.001
Yeah, I'll have to go back and look at that.

12:23.021 --> 12:26.805
I heard there was actually something about my book on the Weekend Review, which I didn't see.

12:26.845 --> 12:28.727
There was, I think, actually.

12:29.011 --> 12:40.267
But that's what you want, obviously.

12:40.287 --> 12:51.103
I've learned that I enjoy the fact that people read it and come away with things to talk about and different conclusions and something worth arguing about.

12:51.556 --> 12:58.043
My goal in writing is not to be didactic or to, like, you know, force people to my point of view.

12:58.083 --> 13:06.011
I'm trying to arm people to make up their own minds, to get the facts out, and to put them out in as objective, fair-minded way as I possibly can.

13:06.432 --> 13:09.996
So it doesn't surprise me that I'm being attacked from both the right and the left, and I think that's healthy.

13:10.056 --> 13:10.937
No, that's wonderful.

13:12.538 --> 13:14.080
I have a book out.

13:14.100 --> 13:20.787
I have a chapter in there where I read about this book, Peter, who stole $20 million in books.

13:21.138 --> 13:25.203
What I like is that I got a letter from the thief, from prison, telling me that it was fair analysis.

13:25.263 --> 13:31.329
I got a letter from the judge telling me, I said, boy, if you can clean both sides, you've done a pretty good job.

13:31.410 --> 13:34.153
If you can antagonize both sides, you've done a good job.

13:34.173 --> 13:36.475
Either way, I guess is what you're saying.

13:36.595 --> 13:42.422
Well, and not only am I being attacked from both sides, but I'm also getting some sort of surreptitious praise from both sides.

13:42.462 --> 13:44.344
I've had a couple people in the White House,

13:45.067 --> 13:51.015
close to the Clintons call me to say, look, we're not going to say another word about this, but we think you got it right.

13:52.377 --> 14:00.167
And I've had a few people, you know, from the, you know, extreme right say, you know, well, you know, we never really believed those Vince Foster murder theories anyway.

14:00.207 --> 14:01.709
Well, but, but they're there.

14:01.989 --> 14:05.674
And anybody who's foolish enough to listen to these talk shows, I mean,

14:07.679 --> 14:13.888
And, of course, you derive your title from Vince Foster, which is a wonderful title, by the way.

14:13.908 --> 14:15.871
It would be beautiful if you coined it yourself.

14:17.373 --> 14:20.317
But, you know, how does Foster figure into this?

14:20.337 --> 14:21.379
Is he the shadow?

14:21.439 --> 14:23.021
Or do you start to look with it?

14:23.041 --> 14:25.104
Well, I think he's a pivotal character.

14:25.144 --> 14:33.957
I mean, in a literary sense, I think he is a metaphor for the tragedy of what our political culture has become.

14:34.595 --> 14:36.798
Now, it's an extreme example, obviously.

14:37.018 --> 14:50.574
Most people do not end up taking their lives to get involved in this, but so many of them are damaged in one way or another, and there's a sad progression of one person after another being forced out or having their reputation tarnished.

14:50.595 --> 14:53.138
You see these characters in the story.

14:54.299 --> 14:57.984
I'm sorry, I lost my train of thought.

14:58.004 --> 15:02.509
You talk about White House, do you remember the Walter Jenkins story, going back to LBJ?

15:03.653 --> 15:06.335
That's a little before my time.

15:06.395 --> 15:13.682
You shouldn't have been down in the YMCA, on the G Street Y, and he didn't go out and kill himself.

15:13.862 --> 15:14.202
Right, right.

15:14.343 --> 15:22.290
He laughed and they said that he was probably over here as close as... Oh, right, I know, but let me back to Foster.

15:22.350 --> 15:27.635
But the point is to go out and kid yourself, and you say, and by the way, if it seems that we're not touching on the book, it's because I have the book.

15:27.775 --> 15:28.876
That's fine.

15:29.016 --> 15:30.697
I'm happy to touch on everything you want.

15:31.018 --> 15:33.660
I'd much rather get some quotes, you know,

15:34.079 --> 15:39.064
pull what I need out of the book itself.

15:39.264 --> 15:50.916
But you point out that any idea that his suicide would precipitate this kind of stuff, you probably wouldn't have done it.

15:51.837 --> 15:57.182
But also, as a correlate, do you think you know why Foster killed himself?

15:57.202 --> 15:59.784
Was it because of why Foster?

15:59.804 --> 16:01.386
What I do is...

16:01.568 --> 16:04.191
And you must have some opinions on that.

16:04.211 --> 16:04.572
Yeah, I do.

16:05.993 --> 16:14.064
I tried in as much detail as I could to show the various things that were weighing on his mind in order to show how severely depressed he was.

16:15.085 --> 16:19.010
And it was only in doing this work that I think I began to come to an understanding of this.

16:19.110 --> 16:26.639
Now, I obviously couldn't have read his mind, but yes, I think Whitewater was one of a number of issues that were on his mind.

16:26.659 --> 16:29.803
I think people have misconstrued that note that was discovered here.

16:30.087 --> 16:31.849
as a quote-unquote suicide note.

16:31.869 --> 16:44.144
But when you see it in context, he wrote this note at the urging of his wife in preparation for what he thought would be public hearings into his conduct in the White House.

16:44.164 --> 16:59.723
So in the note, he mentions things like the Wall Street Journal editorials that no doubt upset him, the travel office situation, which was clearly weighing heavily on him, several other things, but all of them already public events, essentially.

17:00.648 --> 17:14.527
In anticipation of these hearings, he didn't list what I think was really most troubling to him, which he couldn't confide in anyone, which included, I believe, his knowledge of Whitewater and where that was leading.

17:14.567 --> 17:20.715
He'd been involved in how to figure out the final tax treatment of Whitewater just before he died.

17:21.033 --> 17:23.436
His notebooks are filled with references to Whitewater.

17:23.456 --> 17:30.885
He'd been, I think I report for the first time, over in Webster Hubbell's basement looking through these records that had been removed from the Rose Law from the month before he died.

17:31.546 --> 17:37.213
He's the only one in the White House, other than perhaps Hillary Clinton herself, who knew the full scope of the Whitewater thing.

17:37.273 --> 17:38.614
It was definitely on his mind.

17:39.375 --> 17:40.557
It wasn't the only thing, though.

17:40.577 --> 17:48.066
There was also, I think he knew about Webb Hubble's billing problems in the Rose Firm.

17:48.847 --> 17:49.808
As I say in the book,

17:50.108 --> 17:56.354
When it was proposed that Webster-Hubble become Assistant Attorney General and would have to have a confirmation hearing, Vince Foster was very upset.

17:56.374 --> 18:00.197
He said, well, you know, we don't want to have those hearings, do we?

18:00.237 --> 18:03.600
And Bernie Nussbaum says, well, is there something Webster-Hubble has to hide?

18:03.620 --> 18:04.801
He said, oh, no, no, no.

18:04.861 --> 18:10.226
But, you know, it suggests that he did know that looming problem, which ended up, of course, sending Webster-Hubble to jail.

18:11.167 --> 18:13.529
There was a deteriorating relationship with Hillary Clinton.

18:13.849 --> 18:16.572
She had been his great confidant in the Rose Firm.

18:16.592 --> 18:20.115
This relationship started to sour almost immediately in the White House.

18:20.618 --> 18:25.383
He couldn't turn to her to unburden himself because she was part of the problem.

18:26.385 --> 18:29.748
And he was covering up her involvement in the travel office affair.

18:29.849 --> 18:32.251
He'd already lied to an internal investigation about it.

18:32.291 --> 18:37.537
And this, a person who said in his Arkansas commencement speech, integrity was the most important thing in a person's life.

18:37.998 --> 18:39.640
His had been compromised.

18:39.660 --> 18:45.547
And finally, there was a troubled state of his relationship with his wife, which, again, I illuminate in some detail in the book.

18:45.567 --> 18:46.828
But I think the important thing was,

18:47.163 --> 18:48.405
He couldn't talk to his wife.

18:48.425 --> 18:53.371
He couldn't talk to anyone as all of these problems mounted and began to terrify him.

18:53.892 --> 18:57.517
You know, what the Wall Street Journal said about him was nothing, essentially.

18:58.118 --> 19:03.665
When you really look at what they said, I don't think it's those articles that caused him to panic.

19:03.705 --> 19:09.453
But what did cause him to panic was to think, oh my God, the Wall Street Journal wrote this with such a minor impetus.

19:09.694 --> 19:13.018
What will they do to me when they find out what really is going on?

19:13.505 --> 19:19.012
I think that is something that terrified and, again, contributed to this severe depression.

19:19.032 --> 19:21.836
So there's no doubt in your mind that he went out and killed himself?

19:21.856 --> 19:22.697
No doubt whatsoever.

19:22.777 --> 19:33.151
And while I do go over some of the forensic evidence and explore the reasons why people haven't accepted his death as a suicide, to me, it is so compelling.

19:33.552 --> 19:36.276
The troubled state of his mind is so compelling.

19:36.296 --> 19:37.577
The evidence is so extensive.

19:38.419 --> 19:41.723
It, to me, defies probability.

19:42.125 --> 19:49.072
that he wouldn't have killed himself and that somebody else might have killed him and he just happened to be also severely depressed at the same time.

19:49.092 --> 19:50.373
I don't think life works that way.

19:51.294 --> 20:11.254
But again, I think what's significant to me, and again, I leave this to readers to interpret, I don't emphasize it, is that the belief in the murder theory and the conspiracy theories involving Vince Foster's death predictably grew out of the climate of mystery that the White House itself created around it.

20:11.470 --> 20:18.159
The White House reaction to Vince Foster's death was to say, we have got to freeze this, but there can't be any speculation about it.

20:18.179 --> 20:20.742
We don't want people finding out that he was depressed.

20:20.762 --> 20:26.530
We don't want people finding out why he was depressed, because they were fearful of the embarrassment that that might then lead.

20:27.091 --> 20:33.279
But in a vacuum like that, wild theories are going to take root and grow.

20:33.319 --> 20:36.203
When people are not told what happened, they start speculating.

20:37.044 --> 20:39.267
I was very struck at how the day after his death,

20:39.770 --> 21:01.598
The president, in a speech to the White House staff, quickly glossed over the loss of a close colleague and friend, somebody who'd grown up with in Hobart, Arkansas, and focused very much on, don't speculate about this, we'll never know why he took his life, don't talk among yourselves about it, and for God's sake, don't talk to anyone outside of the White House.

21:02.139 --> 21:05.023
It was this containment that became the overarching theme.

21:05.964 --> 21:08.427
The foster family was enlisted in this.

21:08.879 --> 21:14.267
One of the criticisms of the Clintons is that they're lawyers.

21:14.647 --> 21:19.434
They have this lawyerly attitude, which really screws them up all the time.

21:19.554 --> 21:20.315
It's obfuscated.

21:20.496 --> 21:23.480
That seems to be the prime imperative.

21:23.840 --> 21:27.145
Well, you see that in repeated instances in this story.

21:27.225 --> 21:28.928
It's overwhelming.

21:29.048 --> 21:34.836
I'm an old public affairs officer in the service, and one of the first things you learn is,

21:35.407 --> 21:42.157
If you handle it properly, deal with it, admit you've probably made your mistakes, you know, and try and control the damage.

21:42.919 --> 21:51.231
And I wonder, had they dealt with this openly at the beginning?

21:51.251 --> 21:52.513
Oh, we wouldn't be reading about this now.

21:52.613 --> 21:58.242
And again, the reason I start with the death of Vince Foster is that is the pivotal event in this entire story.

21:58.525 --> 22:00.308
Before that, Whitewater was dead.

22:00.328 --> 22:01.149
It was over.

22:01.209 --> 22:02.311
Nobody was talking about Whitewater.

22:02.331 --> 22:03.853
Nobody cared about Whitewater.

22:03.953 --> 22:10.243
It never would have resurfaced if Vince Foster hadn't died and then if those Whitewater files hadn't been taken out of his office.

22:10.724 --> 22:12.567
That's what brought this story back to life.

22:13.388 --> 22:14.650
None of this would have happened.

22:14.670 --> 22:20.078
And again, if you're going to deny that Vince Foster was depressed before his death,

22:20.513 --> 22:22.315
then what are people going to conclude?

22:22.375 --> 22:23.616
They're not going to believe suicide.

22:23.636 --> 22:25.638
They're going to say, well, he must have been killed.

22:25.658 --> 22:27.080
It's the only alternative, isn't it?

22:27.100 --> 22:27.961
It is the only alternative.

22:27.981 --> 22:41.855
And I think it was so short-sighted on the part of the White House not to recognize it was in their interest to be open and to help people understand why, however painful it might have been to have to revisit those events, it was better let the truth come out.

22:41.875 --> 22:45.479
I don't even know if they had to do it in that context or the context of the suicide.

22:45.499 --> 22:47.601
They could have done it.

22:47.661 --> 22:50.284
I mean, that wouldn't have helped them, I think, to say, oh,

22:51.125 --> 22:54.050
He was depressed.

22:54.370 --> 22:57.656
That's a lose-lose situation there, too.

22:57.676 --> 22:58.177
I don't know.

22:58.617 --> 23:08.754
Well, they don't have to reach that conclusion, but they could have been, I think particularly, they could have been more open about letting people understand that he was depressed and that there were reasons for his depression.

23:10.377 --> 23:15.425
Some of them possibly embarrassing to the White House, but you know, so something's embarrassing occasionally.

23:15.445 --> 23:16.727
Again, I think the public can...

23:17.095 --> 23:20.359
accept people as human beings with their inevitable flaws.

23:20.399 --> 23:21.501
You don't have to be perfect.

23:21.641 --> 23:24.665
Anything here that you think you are particularly proud of?

23:24.685 --> 23:30.713
I mean, material that you feel you're recording for the first time?

23:31.254 --> 23:43.069
Well, I have been somewhat sensitive to the kind of White House spin that there's nothing new in the book because I think there's something new on almost every page.

23:43.336 --> 23:51.429
And I think that the reporters who have been most immersed in this story have recognized, have told me that they've been astounded by the new material.

23:51.509 --> 24:02.507
And considering that the National Press Corps combed over this story, I don't mean to boast, but combed over Arkansas and combed over this story and essentially didn't come up with anything, and there's so much new in the book.

24:03.228 --> 24:06.694
I mean, the whole story of this investment from, you know,

24:06.961 --> 24:11.547
of Hillary's direct involvement and all the material from Susan McDougall, all of that is new.

24:11.567 --> 24:15.932
Susan McDougall had never spoken to anyone about this other than in a very perfunctory way.

24:16.013 --> 24:19.237
I mean, there's an enormous amount of new information in all of that.

24:19.557 --> 24:25.625
There's an enormous amount of new information from inside the White House that has not come out before.

24:26.146 --> 24:31.973
All of the chapters five and six exploring the relationship of the Clintons to the bank

24:32.510 --> 24:34.974
with whom they were negotiating the renewals of the loans.

24:35.154 --> 24:36.036
All of this is new.

24:36.336 --> 24:41.364
Nobody had really looked at Whitewater after 1986 when Madison Guarantee became insolvent.

24:41.404 --> 24:43.888
He was nothing in 1986.

24:44.309 --> 24:45.030
He was governor.

24:45.050 --> 24:47.955
He was governor of Arkansas.

24:48.195 --> 24:50.038
I didn't know who he was in 1986.

24:50.078 --> 24:55.727
So I think it's been extremely unfair.

24:56.208 --> 24:57.049
And for the people

24:57.569 --> 25:20.472
daily times reviewer to say that it was recycled material from jeff girth of the new york times jeff girth who is a character in the book is the first to acknowledge that there's a tremendous amount of new material in this book um so i thought that was just factually incorrect the other criticism i've been a little sensitive to is that it uses a narrative style um that doesn't attribute every um every quote in the book but in the notes

25:20.857 --> 25:22.118
And if you read the notes, you'll see this.

25:22.218 --> 25:30.967
I very meticulously explained that every quote comes from the speaker or someone heard the remark, in which case the comment was repeated to the speaker for correction of comment.

25:30.987 --> 25:32.349
I'd do the same things in my own book.

25:32.369 --> 25:39.176
All I would be doing is adding every time that attribution, which would make the book 20 or 30 percent longer than a long book already is.

25:39.256 --> 25:42.439
I don't think readers of a book want to know how I get the information.

25:42.459 --> 25:43.820
They want to know what is the truth.

25:43.840 --> 25:50.167
If it's an apparatus and you can document it, it seems to me that that's 75 percent.

25:50.187 --> 25:50.307
Right.

25:50.658 --> 25:58.171
And I'm very proud of the fact that not one character in this book has come forward to say there's anything inaccurate or unfair in their treatment.

25:59.614 --> 26:01.697
Have you read the novel, The Primary Colors?

26:02.118 --> 26:04.763
No, I haven't read it yet.

26:05.584 --> 26:08.970
Well, many people have told me that it's a wonderful compliment to...

26:09.187 --> 26:18.180
And then I'll be surprised at how accurate it is in comparison to the real characters that I've... I just haven't had time reading this issue, so maybe I'll read it next.

26:18.341 --> 26:38.991
Well, I don't know, although I can tell you that people inside the White House I've spoken to believe that Joe Klein, if he did not literally write it, had a hand in it, because too much of the information they have traced, only he could...

26:39.207 --> 26:41.671
He's the common thread in too much of that.

26:42.112 --> 26:43.273
He denied it.

26:43.293 --> 26:43.814
He denied it.

26:44.055 --> 26:45.497
Well, he was present.

26:45.797 --> 26:47.881
He was following him around in the campaign.

26:47.941 --> 26:51.587
In many cases, he was the only reporter who was following Clinton in the primary campaign.

26:52.288 --> 26:53.269
Now, he's denied writing it.

26:53.289 --> 26:57.516
I think more than one person either wrote it or something.

26:57.556 --> 26:58.758
There's some sort of denial.

26:58.778 --> 27:00.761
One thing I haven't seen come up with a joke line.

27:01.041 --> 27:04.607
I've been to you a couple of times at this hotel.

27:05.060 --> 27:07.843
There was a novel that doesn't have to be on tape.

27:08.023 --> 27:09.445
I wish I could share the wire.

27:09.465 --> 27:10.647
I can tell you why I didn't do it.

27:10.667 --> 27:11.668
I was up to my neck.

27:12.088 --> 27:13.730
I wish, you know, you had or I had.

27:13.750 --> 27:15.733
It's one of the million copies of print, too.

27:15.813 --> 27:16.113
Oh, I know.

27:16.173 --> 27:17.054
It's unbelievable.

27:17.194 --> 27:22.260
I mean, I only hope that people who are interested enough in a fictional version will be interested in a real.

27:22.340 --> 27:23.341
It's really interesting.

27:23.361 --> 27:24.042
Excuse me.

27:24.062 --> 27:24.423
Hi.

27:24.763 --> 27:25.043
Yes.

27:25.063 --> 27:28.407
Is your name with Tim Storch, right?

27:28.427 --> 27:28.668
Yes.

27:28.928 --> 27:29.268
Uh-huh.

27:29.288 --> 27:33.193
There is a... Terrence, no problem.

27:33.680 --> 27:35.082
Can we talk about that?

27:38.006 --> 27:42.451
Yeah, a little more.

27:42.471 --> 27:51.202
Susan apparently emerges as something of a, I wouldn't say a heroine, but without doubt the essential thing.

27:51.363 --> 27:53.946
Susan Thomas is?

27:54.006 --> 27:54.426
No, no.

27:54.507 --> 27:55.268
Oh, Susan McDougal.

27:55.288 --> 27:57.010
Oh, she's certainly a significant character.

27:57.050 --> 28:03.518
Obviously, she's... She seems to be the one you have the most affection for or respect, certainly.

28:03.987 --> 28:05.369
Well, let's put it this way.

28:05.389 --> 28:07.191
I think Susan is a great character.

28:08.272 --> 28:09.633
Now, Susan is a flawed character.

28:09.693 --> 28:15.239
I mean, again, some people have said, well, I know, they make for great reading.

28:15.299 --> 28:30.656
And, you know, Susan, you know, she was a 19-year-old, you know, beauty queen contestant in, you know, Arkadelphia, Arkansas, and she meets Jim McDougall, and pretty soon she's like hobnobbing with the governor, and then she's running a real estate empire, and then she's running an SNL, for God's sake.

28:30.957 --> 28:33.960
Neither she nor Jim had ever even read the regulations governing her.

28:34.295 --> 28:36.318
federally insured institutions.

28:37.841 --> 28:55.729
I think I'm pretty unstinting in showing what a Ponzi scheme the two of them have going at Madison Guarantee, but in the sense that I'm sympathetic that she's a human being with understandable ambitions and emotions, and I think she's at heart a very pretty sympathetic character.

28:56.047 --> 28:59.693
Why do you suppose she agreed to cooperate with you?

28:59.713 --> 29:00.073
I don't know.

29:00.093 --> 29:00.975
It wasn't easy.

29:01.075 --> 29:05.903
You know, people act like, you know, to get somebody to talk to you, just like call them up and suddenly they just feel their guts.

29:05.943 --> 29:08.246
I had to make two trips to California.

29:08.286 --> 29:14.456
The first time, you know, I went all the way out to California spending my own money and she didn't, she wasn't there.

29:14.496 --> 29:18.462
I mean, I thought we had an agreement and it wasn't that we had a specific time.

29:18.482 --> 29:19.744
She said, well, call me when you get out there.

29:19.784 --> 29:20.726
I'll talk to you, whatever.

29:20.746 --> 29:22.529
I said, now I'm coming out, you know, I'm coming.

29:22.629 --> 29:23.370
And then, and then,

29:23.620 --> 29:25.222
She never responded once I got there.

29:25.462 --> 29:32.190
And then I had to go back and risk again the possibility that it wouldn't even happen before she finally did totally talk on the phone.

29:32.230 --> 29:34.834
And, you know, I don't know why people ultimately decide to talk.

29:35.214 --> 29:38.658
I hope it's because, one, they want to get the truth out.

29:38.698 --> 29:43.784
And secondly, you know, I guess I hope they think that I'll deal with it fairly.

29:44.125 --> 29:47.569
Well, do they feel they have belonged to other clients?

29:48.140 --> 29:53.889
It's a complicated situation.

29:54.670 --> 29:57.474
Susan would never have told the Whitewater story the way Jim did.

29:58.315 --> 29:59.597
Jim is the one who spilled the beans.

29:59.617 --> 30:00.518
You see this unfold.

30:00.599 --> 30:02.662
He was bitter and hurt.

30:02.702 --> 30:05.686
He felt he'd been manipulated and used by Clinton and dropped.

30:06.728 --> 30:10.453
Which, by the way, is a common theme that runs through many people who have dealt with them.

30:10.994 --> 30:12.697
And here he subsidized him in Whitewater.

30:12.737 --> 30:14.940
Here he helped him in his political career.

30:15.292 --> 30:18.096
When Jim McDougall was in trouble, the Clintons were not there for him.

30:18.136 --> 30:19.859
He never got anything in return.

30:19.879 --> 30:21.441
That's one of the ironies, frankly, of this story.

30:21.462 --> 30:27.331
Everybody thinks that McDougall subsidized the Clintons, and then Clinton turned around and did some favor for him in return.

30:27.711 --> 30:39.830
What McDougall was upset about is that he never got anything, and not some improper state favor for his regulated SNL, but not even so much as moral support when he fell on hard times and then was indicted for bank fraud.

30:40.551 --> 30:41.232
He was angry.

30:41.532 --> 30:51.963
Clinton had called his mother, MacDougall's mother, when she was very ill and dying, and said that to make her feel better that he was going to hire Jim MacDougall, get him the job again.

30:52.003 --> 30:54.006
And then he never followed through on that.

30:54.026 --> 30:55.988
And that graded on MacDougall.

30:56.008 --> 30:58.771
And to this day, MacDougall gets worked up when he talks about that.

30:59.211 --> 31:02.675
Because every day his mother would call him and say, has Bill called you yet?

31:02.715 --> 31:04.317
And he'd have to say, no.

31:04.955 --> 31:06.677
It was a daily humiliation.

31:06.697 --> 31:07.859
It was like a water torture.

31:08.580 --> 31:15.029
Again, so typical of some of the things you hear, you know, Clinton told McDougal's mother what she wanted to hear and then didn't follow through on it.

31:16.190 --> 31:17.312
You know, how bad is that?

31:17.372 --> 31:22.319
Well, it's no crime, you know, and yet it embraced McDougal, and that's why he told the Whitewater story.

31:22.359 --> 31:23.581
Susan would never have done that.

31:24.061 --> 31:30.370
But once her husband, her former husband, did it, she stood by him, and she wanted to see the truth that came out.

31:30.550 --> 31:34.776
The Clintons then immediately reacted in a way that wasn't truthful, which upset both McDougals.

31:35.313 --> 31:39.537
An irony, though, is that to this day, the McDougals consider themselves supporters of the Clintons.

31:40.378 --> 31:41.500
They've voted for the Clintons.

31:41.520 --> 31:42.441
They've supported them.

31:42.481 --> 31:49.168
They haven't gone to the Independent Council trying to cut a deal for themselves by cooperating against the Clintons.

31:50.169 --> 31:54.874
I think they've behaved in many ways quite honorably under these difficult circumstances.

31:55.254 --> 32:03.683
Was there ever a point, and I think you give a timeline in the book, when you were approached, when you

32:04.473 --> 32:14.488
You had your first discussions, and when you decided to undertake the project, was there a point at which you thought, hey, this isn't going where I think it ought to go.

32:15.229 --> 32:15.850
Maybe I'll can it.

32:17.252 --> 32:19.756
We've all abandoned stories at one point or another.

32:20.197 --> 32:22.760
Not that it's not there, it's just that we can't get it.

32:23.021 --> 32:24.523
Did you ever feel that way?

32:25.162 --> 32:26.184
I didn't really.

32:26.204 --> 32:37.781
I mean, I realized at points this was turning to something quite different from what I had expected, and there were a few times when I wondered, well, am I going to be able to get enough material to really bring this story to life the way I want to?

32:37.821 --> 32:52.603
But no, because I always thought it was, what appealed to me about the story was not just the fact that the Clintons were cooperating, and I thought giving me this kind of historic chance to provide this really immediate portrait of a

32:53.174 --> 32:57.901
sitting president and first lady in something of a crisis situation.

32:58.442 --> 33:03.089
But the characters in the story, I always thought the McDougals were fascinating.

33:03.589 --> 33:05.713
The Clintons themselves are obviously fascinating.

33:06.153 --> 33:07.575
And there were so many questions.

33:07.615 --> 33:13.023
I teach a feature writing course at Columbia, and I always say the best stories start out with a good question.

33:14.065 --> 33:18.912
Don't go to your editors and say, I want to write a story about toxic waste.

33:19.786 --> 33:25.856
Say you want to answer a question that is interesting to you and that you think will be interesting to readers and that you don't know the answer yet, but you hope you'll find it.

33:26.157 --> 33:28.000
And there are so many unanswered questions here.

33:28.441 --> 33:30.244
What really had happened to Vince Foster?

33:30.264 --> 33:36.234
A great mystery that was inspiring a national debate that nobody was really focusing on factually.

33:36.274 --> 33:42.064
All they were doing was picking whatever ideological theory they wanted to.

33:42.500 --> 33:45.783
Why was whitewater still a problem?

33:45.864 --> 33:50.388
What were those files in Vince Fox's office, and why were they taken out when they were?

33:52.070 --> 33:53.431
What was going on here?

33:53.451 --> 33:57.956
There were a lot of questions in my mind, and I figured if there's a question, then there's an answer somewhere.

33:58.016 --> 34:09.368
One of the problems in writing a book, of course, that is subject to the headlines changing on a daily basis, and I think you actually bring it right up to

34:09.618 --> 34:10.680
January or February.

34:10.700 --> 34:11.601
Yeah, it was in January.

34:11.641 --> 34:13.885
I provided a little sketch of what was going on.

34:13.925 --> 34:19.534
And you must be saying, Jesus, what's going to happen here before the book comes out of it?

34:19.555 --> 34:22.780
Tell me a little bit about that risk that you run.

34:22.840 --> 34:33.077
Well, it was something of a risk, except from a literary perspective, this story ends in March of 94, essentially the time I started working on it.

34:33.412 --> 34:35.575
So there was a literary closure to the story.

34:35.595 --> 34:43.365
I mean, at this point, March of 94, the Clintons were pretty much locked into the line of defense that they had adopted.

34:43.405 --> 34:50.755
It does not have an ending in the sense that we yet know the outcome of the current investigations.

34:51.055 --> 34:52.257
That is open-ended.

34:52.277 --> 34:55.341
That could be the subject of either more stories or God knows a sequel.

34:55.381 --> 35:02.170
But in terms of what happened then and how they dealt with it while occupying the White House,

35:02.858 --> 35:05.643
All the elements of the story were in place in March of 1994.

35:06.004 --> 35:17.003
So I felt any, the things I allude to in the foreword are investigative developments that have current interest, but they all shed light on events that happened in the time frame of my narrative.

35:17.825 --> 35:27.702
I suppose I realized there was a risk that eventually the Independent Council will come out with a report which adds new information to the time frame that I cover.

35:28.222 --> 35:29.964
And I just figure that's a risk I can live with.

35:29.984 --> 35:33.148
I think, you know, people have to understand I'm one person.

35:33.269 --> 35:36.333
A book that reflects the work that was done in a certain period of time.

35:36.353 --> 35:37.114
Yeah, exactly.

35:37.134 --> 35:40.198
I did the best I could, and I'm confident I didn't cut corners.

35:41.259 --> 35:43.382
I hired two researchers to work on this.

35:43.422 --> 35:44.904
I hired a full-time fact-checker.

35:44.924 --> 35:52.193
I did everything I knew to be fair, and I used every investigative technique that I knew of within the time allotted.

35:52.213 --> 35:56.018
And, you know, I think all you can do is do the best you can, and then you can live with yourself.

35:56.774 --> 36:05.665
We say you haven't been a political reporter in your background, but how did your actual journalist's background?

36:05.685 --> 36:10.972
I mean, I think the answer is obviously you can articulate a part of your assistant in this particular book.

36:10.992 --> 36:21.685
Well, my last book was about Den of Thieves, and that involved, you know, much more sophisticated and big-dollar machinations on Wall Street and in the financial markets.

36:22.373 --> 36:27.099
But I do have a background, and I was an editor at the Wall Street Journal, a reporter at the Wall Street Journal.

36:27.199 --> 36:30.163
I've reported a lot in financial stories.

36:30.603 --> 36:33.988
So the whole banking side of this was not particularly intimidating.

36:34.008 --> 36:38.033
As financial stories go, this one is really quite simple.

36:38.994 --> 36:42.098
And it's not very confusing once you get it into chronological order.

36:42.118 --> 36:44.721
Anybody who's taken out a bank mortgage, I think, can understand it.

36:45.101 --> 36:46.964
But I was familiar with those kinds of institutions.

36:46.984 --> 36:48.786
And I also have a legal background.

36:49.171 --> 36:58.703
So I'm pretty familiar with the course of legal investigations, the kinds of problems that surface in cases that involve obstruction of justice.

37:00.645 --> 37:04.130
So I felt pretty comfortable delving into a lot of those areas as well.

37:04.150 --> 37:06.212
So in that sense, it was sort of right up my alley.

37:06.833 --> 37:11.259
The political overlay to me was not terribly significant.

37:11.279 --> 37:18.688
I mean, I did get into it to some extent, but this is not so much a book about politics, although it is

37:19.225 --> 37:21.709
Well, I guess I have to say it is ultimately a book about politics.

37:21.829 --> 37:26.756
Well, Tom Collins called it one of the great political books of the season.

37:27.137 --> 37:28.439
Well, I was thrilled that he said so.

37:28.499 --> 37:35.590
I think it's not a book about politics in that it spends most of its time delving into political strategy of the participants.

37:35.630 --> 37:43.782
I think it simply is saying how people behave and react in times difficult circumstances.

37:44.133 --> 37:47.357
as a way of illuminating a sort of broader political culture.

37:47.657 --> 37:49.079
Has the Washington Post reviewed it yet?

37:49.099 --> 37:49.359
Yes.

37:49.800 --> 37:51.342
How did they have it made those?

37:51.422 --> 37:53.204
It was good.

37:53.705 --> 37:57.910
Being cognizant of their political attitudes.

37:57.970 --> 37:59.532
It was the first review that came out.

37:59.592 --> 38:01.514
It was a week ago, Sunday.

38:01.574 --> 38:08.503
It was by Jonathan Yardley, who's their chief book critic.

38:09.175 --> 38:15.023
As I remember it, it was kind of mostly just saying what was in the book.

38:15.043 --> 38:18.807
It didn't dwell too much on it as a book, per se.

38:19.729 --> 38:26.157
I think the Washington Post is a little defensive about somebody coming from New York and writing a political book.

38:26.297 --> 38:27.839
But it was a very nice review.

38:27.919 --> 38:29.461
Especially a political outsider.

38:29.641 --> 38:35.609
They have political reporters in New York as well, but politics is not really your beat, so to speak.

38:35.629 --> 38:35.889
No.

38:36.570 --> 38:38.693
The only review that got my...

38:39.196 --> 38:47.888
you know, hackles up a little bit was the Daily Times, because I thought that the point that it was recycled material infuriated me.

38:47.908 --> 38:49.850
That, to me, was just factually wrong.

38:49.870 --> 38:59.263
And the rest of it, you know, she's entitled to her opinion, but it seems so kind of missing the point, you know, that was sort of disheartening.

38:59.497 --> 39:01.442
So are you still with the journal?

39:01.462 --> 39:02.465
Are you full-time?

39:02.585 --> 39:04.370
No, I'm pretty much freelance now.

39:04.410 --> 39:11.990
I have an office at Smart Money Magazine, which is a past journal and enterprise where I contribute, and I write articles for The New Yorker.

39:12.732 --> 39:12.932
Wonderful.

39:13.216 --> 39:15.819
I'll go back to that once I get a breather.

39:16.680 --> 39:19.984
So the idea of another book will just have to present itself, right?

39:20.304 --> 39:22.687
Well, I'm not saying it'll present itself the way this one did.

39:22.707 --> 39:25.630
I can't think of another big project where somebody just came into your office.

39:25.650 --> 39:26.311
You don't have one.

39:26.912 --> 39:28.954
No, I don't have one right in mind at the moment.

39:29.174 --> 39:34.841
A good book idea takes some time to gel in mind.

39:36.142 --> 39:39.826
You know what, I think we've got, we'll give you a little time.

39:39.846 --> 39:40.307
Okay, thank you.

39:40.347 --> 39:41.248
We'll get 45 minutes here.
