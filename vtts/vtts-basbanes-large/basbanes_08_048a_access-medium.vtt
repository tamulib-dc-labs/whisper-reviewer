00:02.883 --> 00:08.211
Robert Massey about the Roman arts.

00:08.231 --> 00:14.360
This really is a departure for you in terms of technique style time.

00:14.560 --> 00:17.345
It's a departure and a return, in a sense.

00:17.365 --> 00:20.670
A return to journalism, which is where I began.

00:20.710 --> 00:21.291
That's right.

00:21.311 --> 00:22.532
You were at Newsweek, weren't you?

00:22.552 --> 00:25.617
I was at Newsweek and the Saturday evening post.

00:26.660 --> 00:38.658
And then I became a writer of histories and biographies and a habituator of libraries and archives and so forth.

00:38.678 --> 00:42.804
And for this book, there wasn't anything in the libraries or archives.

00:42.824 --> 00:44.406
I did what journalists do.

00:44.426 --> 00:56.143
I, with the added additional sort of technological assistance of a tape recorder, which journalists now use, but in my day, 25, 30 years ago,

00:56.360 --> 00:58.083
You just scribbled as fast as you could.

00:58.643 --> 01:10.581
And I went everywhere, to Siberia, to Moscow, to England, in search of DNA scientists and Romanoffs and lawyers and so forth.

01:10.902 --> 01:14.988
Was it a sense that there were loose ends that had to be tied?

01:15.248 --> 01:19.154
Nicholas and Alexander were 67, so we're talking almost 30 years.

01:19.314 --> 01:22.399
Well, there was the fact that the bodies had never been found.

01:22.519 --> 01:23.320
But for you?

01:23.360 --> 01:24.021
For me it was...

01:24.271 --> 01:33.883
For me, I was sitting there one day working on Dreadnought II, Son of Dreadnought.

01:33.903 --> 01:36.426
Is there a Dreadnought II?

01:36.446 --> 01:40.191
I've done two years of work, and I'm going to go back on it.

01:40.211 --> 01:45.558
Well, that ended the night the war began, and this next book should start the next day.

01:45.598 --> 01:49.603
I haven't actually written anything, but I've done a lot of research.

01:49.921 --> 01:52.104
Will that be the title, do you think?

01:52.344 --> 01:54.427
No, no, no.

01:54.447 --> 01:57.191
I don't know quite what... I'm sorry to jump around.

01:57.271 --> 02:07.545
No, yeah, the problem there is the material, the dreadnoughts kind of disappear after Jutland, and it becomes a submarine war.

02:07.966 --> 02:12.031
So I can't call it the Dreadnought War, which would be a good title.

02:12.051 --> 02:13.493
It would be nice, wouldn't it?

02:14.034 --> 02:16.317
As a naval officer, I can appreciate that.

02:16.887 --> 02:17.948
I'm an old mini-bolster.

02:18.249 --> 02:28.340
I'm not going to leave that subject, Nick, until I have a place to use the ten days I spent on the battleship in New Jersey when she was firing her 16-inch guns.

02:29.081 --> 02:32.145
And I had spent three and a half years on aircraft carriers.

02:32.165 --> 02:34.407
I was three and a half years on aircraft carriers.

02:34.427 --> 02:41.275
Well, but we never saw a dreadnought, except maybe I was in the Korean War, so maybe on the horizon.

02:41.727 --> 02:45.293
But here I was in the turrets when the guns fired.

02:45.313 --> 02:46.915
So anyway, I want to use that material.

02:47.476 --> 02:55.309
But one day a friend called and said, what do you think about these bones they found in Siberia?

02:55.629 --> 02:57.312
And I said, I haven't thought much about them at all.

02:57.512 --> 02:58.894
Well, are they real or not?

02:58.914 --> 03:01.238
And I said, I don't know anything about them, frankly.

03:02.247 --> 03:03.589
But you had heard something about it.

03:03.609 --> 03:05.591
Well, I'd read just about it in the paper.

03:07.274 --> 03:07.794
This is 91?

03:07.874 --> 03:09.316
No, this was 93.

03:09.877 --> 03:13.302
And they had already, they dug them up in 91.

03:14.063 --> 03:17.607
The forensic anthropologist had already been there.

03:17.627 --> 03:22.694
The DNA had gone, the bones had gone to England for DNA testing.

03:22.714 --> 03:28.622
And Peter Gill, the head of the British laboratory, had said, well, we're 98.5% sure.

03:29.823 --> 03:31.225
And...

03:32.065 --> 03:35.850
And this person said, so do you believe that these are the bones?

03:36.230 --> 03:37.592
Anyway, I didn't know.

03:37.712 --> 03:39.294
I said, I don't think I'm going to get involved.

03:39.314 --> 03:42.058
You know, it's been, I said, 20, 28 years.

03:43.099 --> 03:48.987
But they said, well, you know, Bob, we all know about, this was somebody my wife's age, and she's quite a lot younger.

03:49.007 --> 03:50.809
She said, we all know about this family.

03:50.829 --> 03:54.294
We all know this story because of Nicholas and Alexandra.

03:54.314 --> 03:55.515
And I'm fascinated by it.

03:55.535 --> 03:56.937
I really don't understand why you are.

03:57.378 --> 03:58.339
I can tell you something.

03:58.379 --> 04:00.081
Somebody's going to write this book.

04:00.533 --> 04:03.276
And if it's not you, they'll use a lot of your material.

04:03.977 --> 04:11.707
So I said, and she had called me because she had heard Pavel Ivanov, this Russian scientist, speak in New York.

04:12.888 --> 04:14.590
He was touring around the country.

04:15.191 --> 04:25.904
And so what I did was to get, through my lawyer, the Nexus stuff, you know, on Romanov, Bones, Siberia.

04:26.225 --> 04:28.127
And I got a stack of paper that high.

04:28.985 --> 04:31.168
And I read it in chronological order, and I read it.

04:31.208 --> 04:33.111
I thought, this is fascinating.

04:33.651 --> 04:38.819
And I sort of began to make connections, you know, about St.

04:39.399 --> 04:48.372
Petersburg versus Yekaterinburg, and British versus Russians, going back to the refusal to accept the family, and so on.

04:50.014 --> 04:55.161
So I sort of said, let me see how this would work, and I wrote a kind of a

04:56.255 --> 04:57.757
what do you call it, a proposal.

04:58.619 --> 05:05.549
And I took it to them, and I said, I'd like to just sort of sit down and do an evaluation of this.

05:05.609 --> 05:18.489
I was thinking of a book where I wouldn't do a whole lot of reporting, but I would collect all this material from the London Times and wherever, and sort of said, this is what this means.

05:19.150 --> 05:21.874
You know, if true, it means that the...

05:22.968 --> 05:27.614
that the Sokoloff report was wrong, that the bones and so forth.

05:27.634 --> 05:31.139
But anyway, to make a long story only slightly shorter, I got involved.

05:31.179 --> 05:34.824
I found there wasn't anything you could really grab and say, this is what happened.

05:34.864 --> 05:37.588
I had to go out and talk to everybody.

05:37.628 --> 05:39.250
That's fun, though.

05:39.270 --> 05:40.111
It was great fun.

05:40.352 --> 05:50.005
As a matter of fact, Nick, the thing I'm wrestling with now as I go around the country is, yes, I'd like to go back and do Dreadnought,

05:50.272 --> 05:53.897
to, but before I do it, I had such a good time.

05:54.698 --> 05:56.481
It was meeting people.

05:57.943 --> 06:04.311
Is there anything else that I could do which I could do?

06:05.753 --> 06:08.077
Because doing this made a lot of sense.

06:08.217 --> 06:12.783
I did it in a relatively short time, but I had a lot of background in it.

06:13.304 --> 06:17.249
And I don't have that much background in just anything.

06:17.650 --> 06:19.232
I don't want to just go out and be a

06:19.600 --> 06:23.264
a true crime reporter, be it another Joe McGinnis or whatever.

06:23.544 --> 06:24.064
So, I don't know.

06:25.526 --> 06:30.070
Well, you also, Joe's a point of money, but you also like to get your facts straight, too.

06:30.591 --> 06:32.853
Get them first hand, shall we say.

06:33.013 --> 06:43.624
I do, and also, on that subject, I can tell you that I, for the first time, encountered the New Yorkers fact-checking.

06:45.726 --> 06:48.949
Yeah, meat grinder.

06:49.672 --> 06:53.356
I guess it was, when I first went in, I just was appalled.

06:53.416 --> 06:57.401
I said, she would say, how do you know this?

06:57.882 --> 06:58.823
And I'd say, I saw it.

06:59.304 --> 07:02.027
She'd say, yeah, but do you have any other corroboration?

07:03.448 --> 07:05.891
I'd say, I saw it with my own eyes.

07:06.032 --> 07:10.277
I had the same instance, and they hired a copy editor who must be elected to the order.

07:10.297 --> 07:11.338
She was amazing.

07:11.859 --> 07:13.681
Challenged me on everything.

07:13.941 --> 07:14.502
And I liked it.

07:14.602 --> 07:15.042
It was cool.

07:15.423 --> 07:18.126
But there was one instance where I'm at this trial in Iowa.

07:18.292 --> 07:25.045
And I'm describing this guy having Kenny Rhodes, he's the guy who turned in Steven for the bounty.

07:25.405 --> 07:31.517
And I'm describing him having, enjoying straight up cocktails with these librarians.

07:31.537 --> 07:32.819
And she says, who told you this?

07:32.960 --> 07:33.741
How do you know this?

07:33.961 --> 07:34.923
I said, I observed it.

07:34.983 --> 07:35.544
I was there.

07:35.605 --> 07:37.047
I was eavesdropping.

07:37.208 --> 07:37.909
I mean, I was.

07:38.270 --> 07:40.213
Oh, why did you say so?

07:40.554 --> 07:40.654
Yeah.

07:41.292 --> 07:44.415
I said, I say so by being the omniscient observer.

07:44.475 --> 07:45.016
I was there.

07:45.557 --> 07:46.798
That's exactly what you're saying.

07:47.178 --> 07:48.079
And that's fun, isn't it?

07:48.660 --> 08:08.722
But the point is that the whole sort of, from the start to the finish, of gathering the facts from the air, from the people while they're still living, is very different from writing a biography of Peter the Great.

08:10.043 --> 08:10.624
Fantastic.

08:11.144 --> 08:17.090
Well, reconstructing that assassination scene, as you did at the beginning.

08:17.110 --> 08:31.206
That was based on a number of things, but most newly, the Urofsky note, which Edward Rudzinski had used, although he hadn't discovered it.

08:31.826 --> 08:39.835
Galey Ryabov discovered it ten years before, and that helped Ryabov and Abdonin to locate the bones.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.392
Have you met Rudzinski?

08:43.412 --> 08:44.174
No.

08:44.194 --> 08:45.537
Well, I did.

08:45.777 --> 08:48.443
I went to see him in Moscow, and then I saw him again in New York.

08:48.463 --> 08:50.648
He's a fascinating guy.

08:50.668 --> 09:01.131
He's a playwright, and he has this kind of pixie-ish, elfin, charming,

09:01.668 --> 09:03.911
view that facts are starting points.

09:05.152 --> 09:08.696
But he also had access.

09:08.736 --> 09:12.741
He trained, his university training was as an archivist.

09:12.761 --> 09:31.202
So when he got into trouble over some of his plays, because he skated on very thin ice during the last ten years of the regime, and when he was sort of shut down, he then went back and started

09:31.469 --> 09:34.693
reading Diaries of Nicholas II, and wrote that book.

09:34.713 --> 09:38.318
And when I went to see him, I said, why aren't you writing this book?

09:38.558 --> 09:44.686
I mean, because if you were, I wouldn't be, because I was out of that business.

09:45.326 --> 09:51.654
And he was not only much more recently in it, but he was on this government commission.

09:52.275 --> 09:54.078
I mean, he had a clear insight.

09:54.378 --> 09:57.662
He said, and I understood clearly what he meant, he said, I can't do it anymore.

09:58.385 --> 09:59.447
And I felt that way.

09:59.688 --> 10:09.270
Now, I've got a question, and just because I see it and it's in your book, and if you want to tell me what this is all about, what's this all about?

10:09.290 --> 10:10.794
Is there anything you want to tell me about?

10:10.854 --> 10:12.297
What is this all about?

10:13.159 --> 10:14.402
Near the end of the writing?

10:15.260 --> 10:20.926
Is that anything that you want to see in the print, or I'm just wondering what... No, there's not anything I want to see in the print.

10:20.946 --> 10:21.987
Okay, but I'd be glad to tell you.

10:22.567 --> 10:26.932
I would like to know this, and it's pertinent to the author.

10:27.012 --> 10:29.054
Okay, we're back on it.

10:29.074 --> 10:30.776
Yeah, I'd rather you left that out.

10:30.796 --> 10:33.599
Well, I just... It's the kind of thing that... It jumps out.

10:33.859 --> 10:36.802
I always re-acknowled Vincent.

10:36.822 --> 10:37.042
Yeah, yeah.

10:37.062 --> 10:38.263
I've been asked about it before.

10:38.744 --> 10:39.525
I'm sure.

10:39.545 --> 10:40.446
Because it sticks out.

10:40.906 --> 10:43.849
But you're... Because you're...

10:44.116 --> 10:49.143
an author as well as a critic and so forth.

10:49.203 --> 10:51.206
And you can trust me on top of all that.

10:51.226 --> 10:53.308
It is fascinating.

10:53.348 --> 10:56.032
Let's get back to the book, of course.

10:57.254 --> 11:02.621
You didn't really feel like you were revisiting prior work.

11:02.701 --> 11:08.689
I don't think there's very little overlap except for this execution scene.

11:09.040 --> 11:12.505
And that last... It does provide a nice link, doesn't it, actually, between the books.

11:12.685 --> 11:31.029
Well, and because this is about the sort of ending of this story, and there was a misunderstanding or just bad knowledge as to what happened, and I wanted the reader to know.

11:31.049 --> 11:34.634
I mean, there'd be a lot of readers, I hope, for this book who hadn't read Nichols.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.018
You would hope also that they'd go back.

11:38.133 --> 11:42.197
Well, I think probably a lot of the readers of Nicholas Alexander are in another world.

11:42.237 --> 11:46.641
I mean, 28 years ago... Yeah, the book's in print, isn't it?

11:46.661 --> 11:47.502
Oh, he's still in print.

11:47.522 --> 11:48.583
Yeah.

11:48.603 --> 11:58.632
So, I mean, it will certainly encourage people coming to the... If this book begins to do well, I suppose it'll help that book, yeah.

11:58.652 --> 12:01.014
It seems to me DNA makes this whole thing possible.

12:01.695 --> 12:02.215
Absolutely.

12:02.395 --> 12:04.697
And, of course, the end of the Cold War, that's another obvious one.

12:04.717 --> 12:06.359
Absolutely, yeah.

12:06.379 --> 12:07.600
Those are the two things.

12:08.103 --> 12:09.745
And they came along in the middle 1980s.

12:11.167 --> 12:19.337
And DNA made not only the identification of the bones possible, but the identification of Anna Anderson possible.

12:19.357 --> 12:30.731
Explain, explain, you don't hear, but explain, for the people who read my call, how you can use DNA today for people who have been dead for all this, 16, 18 years.

12:32.814 --> 12:37.840
You can extract the DNA...

12:38.073 --> 12:47.644
sequence, this ACGT, these chemical sequence in which they appear in the chromosomes.

12:48.104 --> 13:05.143
You can extract from a variety of human, as I say, parts, the bones, blood, bodily fluids, hair, and these bones which had been in the ground

13:05.393 --> 13:18.006
really bones were all that was left, there was a little bit of hair, were the oldest bones which have ever been subjected to DNA extraction, but they did it.

13:18.947 --> 13:20.649
But how can you say it's them?

13:20.929 --> 13:22.211
You certainly have relatives today, right?

13:22.231 --> 13:23.512
Oh, of course, I'm sorry, yeah.

13:23.552 --> 13:33.983
You take the DNA sequence, you have computers, and they go to that part of a

13:34.402 --> 13:47.318
a DNA sequence which may be miles long in terms of, you know, they were stretched out and these base pair sequences were blown up to, you know, something that was visible to the eye.

13:48.480 --> 13:51.924
They go to the parts which are most variable between human beings.

13:52.345 --> 14:01.637
Most of DNA separates us from vegetables and dogs and, you know, we're human beings.

14:01.997 --> 14:02.738
But the difference

14:02.971 --> 14:07.596
And they compare that, then they extract DNA from somebody who is known.

14:08.197 --> 14:12.822
And it doesn't have to be somebody contemporary of, in this case, the bones.

14:13.203 --> 14:16.987
They could be a descendant from a common ancestor.

14:17.708 --> 14:21.072
And they can, well, let me just give you an example.

14:21.612 --> 14:32.725
With the Empress Alexandra, her sisters, Alexandra's sister was Princess Victoria Battenberg.

14:33.262 --> 14:41.630
Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was her grandson, and he has the same DNA sequence as Alexandra did.

14:42.090 --> 15:01.969
So when he agreed to give blood, they could then compare this with these bones of this 46-year-old woman, or this middle-aged woman, and these three young women, and determine that this was, since it was identical, that this was Alexandra of Hesse,

15:02.810 --> 15:08.655
and that these three females, which had the same DNA, were her daughters.

15:08.675 --> 15:21.847
So you had not only the sort of historical evidence, these bodies were in this site, not that far from the original grave site.

15:21.927 --> 15:32.496
Although there were two bodies missing, the party was significantly similar to the party,

15:32.678 --> 15:34.020
been executed and disappeared.

15:34.540 --> 15:36.983
And then you compare the DNA and you know who it is.

15:39.466 --> 15:42.770
Did this more or less confirm your suspicions or were there surprises?

15:44.312 --> 15:56.005
I had accepted the Sokolov theory when Sokolov, the white investigator, got there a few hours, a few days after the murders and began to collect evidence.

15:56.025 --> 15:59.650
He couldn't find the bodies and looked very hard for six months.

16:00.070 --> 16:01.572
He then

16:01.855 --> 16:05.499
first hypothesized and then declared that they'd been destroyed.

16:05.559 --> 16:06.800
They had vanished.

16:08.062 --> 16:11.165
And there was evidence of the massacre.

16:11.185 --> 16:31.727
I mean, he did not believe the Soviet story that they'd killed only the Tsar, because they found all kinds of, they found pieces of burned clothing, you know, corset stays and jewelry and so forth, which had belonged to the members of the family.

16:32.213 --> 16:34.335
But no bodies.

16:34.455 --> 16:35.256
One finger.

16:36.257 --> 16:37.778
But no bodies.

16:38.159 --> 16:46.947
And so he said in his report that they had been destroyed by fire and by sulfuric acid.

16:47.428 --> 16:50.230
And that's what everybody believed, and that's what I reported.

16:50.991 --> 16:51.692
And I was wrong.

16:53.513 --> 16:54.855
Along with everybody else.

16:54.915 --> 17:01.461
But in fact, they had been pulled back up from the mine shaft where they were.

17:01.930 --> 17:14.804
because Jurovsky, the chief of the execution squad to be told to destroy the evidence, decided that they were too obvious, that people had seen and heard them.

17:15.405 --> 17:19.890
And he was taking them somewhere else when, in the middle of the night, the next night, the truck got stuck.

17:21.071 --> 17:24.014
And the night was short, Siberia in July.

17:25.135 --> 17:26.677
And the Whites were close.

17:26.717 --> 17:28.579
They could hear the artillery.

17:29.369 --> 17:50.717
And they had to do something, so they dug a grave, it was shallow because they hit rock, and they dumped the bodies in there, and put sulfuric acid in, and then dirt, and then railroad ties on top, and more dirt, and it was a pretty helter-skelter, hit-or-miss thing, but it worked.

17:51.558 --> 17:54.622
Nobody saw them again until 1979.

17:54.642 --> 17:58.127
And then the people who discovered them had to be

17:58.580 --> 18:09.777
They discovered them, they took, they dug up, they took three skulls out of the grave, uh, hoping that they could find somebody who would help them validate the skulls.

18:10.498 --> 18:23.438
But, you know, all of the scientists and all of the laboratories were government, and, uh, Abdonan kept the skull that he thought was Nicholas under his bed for a year.

18:23.458 --> 18:25.802
It turned out not to be.

18:26.423 --> 18:43.644
A year later, they went out and buried it again, and said, uh, uh, we will pass this knowledge on down to Alexander Abdonin's son, and to his son, whatever, until it's, uh, times change.

18:43.664 --> 18:48.550
Well, times have changed to the point where they're considering canonization, which is amazing.

18:48.570 --> 18:49.251
Yeah, it is.

18:50.132 --> 18:50.433
It is.

18:50.473 --> 18:56.380
That's the only, uh, decision that the government, or that the church, really...

18:57.085 --> 19:00.931
the government will do whatever the church recommends has to make.

19:01.531 --> 19:02.032
Amazing.

19:02.072 --> 19:15.952
You know, I've often looked at this story, and I'm sure you could agree that it's like all of a sudden discovering what happened to Amelia Earhart, you know, one of these mysteries that has captivated people.

19:16.974 --> 19:17.995
Well, that's true.

19:18.236 --> 19:22.582
That and the linked mystery of Anna Anderson.

19:22.602 --> 19:26.147
You know, Amelia Earhart, I did read somewhere, you know, some

19:26.785 --> 19:33.975
explanation of the really nonsensical... She was flying... Well, she was a terrible navigator, right?

19:33.995 --> 19:46.412
Well, yeah, and she was flying east into the rising sun over water and with enough fuel for about an hour after sunrise.

19:46.993 --> 19:55.324
And here she is looking for this little, tiny fly speck in the middle of the Pacific Ocean with the sun in her eyes.

19:55.979 --> 19:57.982
Wasn't there a guy with her?

19:58.402 --> 19:59.284
Yeah, that's right.

19:59.304 --> 20:00.405
He was an alcoholic.

20:01.567 --> 20:11.340
And all this business about her being captured by the Japanese because she was photographing one of the marshals of the Marianas or something.

20:11.360 --> 20:12.222
I mean, that was nonsense.

20:12.602 --> 20:13.824
She went down at sea.

20:14.024 --> 20:17.088
I used to call it in the Navy fuel exhaustion.

20:17.309 --> 20:21.835
Interestingly, I mean, this is how sort of...

20:22.304 --> 20:29.373
When I went down to see Maples, this guy in Gainesville, where he was peaceful here.

20:30.374 --> 20:45.072
One of the people who came to supper was a guy named Addison Pound, who had made some money because his family owned real estate around Gainesville, and they'd sold, you know, these were scrub pines, and now it was valuable.

20:45.753 --> 20:49.898
Addison Pound had been a Navy aviator,

20:50.317 --> 20:56.883
on either the Lexington or the Saratoga, which was ordered to look for Amelia Earhart.

20:56.903 --> 21:01.228
And he was, he had, I think he'd been to the Naval Academy, he was an ensign.

21:01.668 --> 21:09.616
But he helped plot the search, you know, they did sort of, not quadrants, but whatever like this.

21:09.796 --> 21:15.401
But he said, you know, we were at Pearl Harbor when this happened.

21:15.461 --> 21:16.422
We were sent down there.

21:17.103 --> 21:19.125
We didn't get there until ten days later.

21:20.692 --> 21:25.922
And then they, you know, they flew out like this and over like this and behind.

21:26.363 --> 21:32.836
Every day for a week, because I guess the president had told them to.

21:33.698 --> 21:39.409
Yeah, well, anyway, it's almost like, you think, but...

21:39.676 --> 21:41.599
with this particular story.

21:41.659 --> 21:42.981
Yeah, it's a great, great story.

21:43.021 --> 21:47.427
One of these unsolved mysteries, to coin a phrase.

21:47.507 --> 21:48.829
What's your schedule, by the way?

21:48.849 --> 21:51.392
I have nothing to do after this.

21:52.274 --> 21:56.419
There are, of course, many squabbles among descendants.

21:56.439 --> 22:00.325
You can have a Russian story without a lot of... It's almost like I'm a Greek.

22:00.665 --> 22:03.630
It's a tall story.

22:04.991 --> 22:05.813
The other Greeks, too.

22:06.133 --> 22:06.814
Well, the Russians are

22:07.300 --> 22:08.241
got it from the Greeks.

22:08.261 --> 22:10.965
They got their religion from the Greeks.

22:11.826 --> 22:18.655
The guy who went with me, Peter Serendinaki, is a Greek whose family went to Russia about 150 years ago.

22:19.997 --> 22:23.361
He was a ship captain, and he became an admiral and a Russian navy.

22:23.381 --> 22:28.168
Then they became a great Russian, not a great, but a significant Russian family.

22:28.188 --> 22:33.595
And he married Masha Tolstoy, whose great-grandfather was Leo Tolstoy.

22:33.828 --> 22:40.594
They live across the river from me, and they're, you know, Masha did all of the, she did all the transcriptions from Russian.

22:40.614 --> 22:44.298
Yeah, you did about a hundred interviews, I think?

22:44.318 --> 22:44.718
Yeah.

22:44.738 --> 22:50.524
What were some of the most significant things that you learned in the one-on-one?

22:50.684 --> 22:56.209
Well, I think, you know, I spent five days with Adonin.

22:56.409 --> 23:01.354
He described finding the graves.

23:01.655 --> 23:23.147
I was very much helped by Maples, who was a very unusual scientist who overreached, did a great job, and had a chance to read the book yet, but did a great job in identifying bones in Siberia.

23:23.528 --> 23:30.919
And then he totally screwed up, because he got involved in DNA, sort of

23:31.203 --> 23:33.446
authentication, which he wasn't qualified to do.

23:33.987 --> 23:54.556
I mean, he really wanted to be careful how to say this, because Random House lawyers looked over what I said, but he was greedy for fame, and he tried, and he unwisely attacked Peter Gill, and he doesn't have the competence to do that, but he was significant.

23:55.117 --> 24:01.125
Solovyov, this Russian investigator, sort of a totally dedicated

24:01.747 --> 24:07.454
A guy like Javert in Les Miserables was impressive.

24:07.695 --> 24:16.446
I was very impressed by Nicholas Romanov, the elderly but still very wise and tolerant prince.

24:17.026 --> 24:21.392
The guy who said, I don't want to go back and they shouldn't invite any of us back.

24:21.845 --> 24:26.990
I was just about to say, do any of them harbor any thoughts about, you know, going back and reading?

24:27.010 --> 24:29.872
Well, I mean, Maria does.

24:30.032 --> 24:31.173
This woman does.

24:31.373 --> 24:33.255
She looks like he's playing a role.

24:35.497 --> 24:37.319
Well, he's not a bad little boy.

24:37.339 --> 24:42.463
He's doing what he's been brought up to do, and Maria's doing what she was brought up to do.

24:42.503 --> 24:51.531
And it's really, she hasn't got any of the sort of substance that her distant cousin Nicholas has.

24:52.000 --> 25:03.692
And Nicholas and the other males think that she's pretentious and even ridiculous, but they can't just make her go away.

25:03.953 --> 25:09.398
And she is actively campaigning for... That's how the Russians mean it.

25:09.418 --> 25:15.085
Well, that's what Nicholas says, and that's what the guy... It's like the Greek said, the last thing I heard that he was nothing.

25:15.105 --> 25:16.506
The king will come back, yeah.

25:16.773 --> 25:22.980
We don't have enough problems.

25:23.000 --> 25:27.565
You know, here in Moscow, he said, the growth industry is steel doors.

25:28.406 --> 25:33.331
Yeah, and security businesses, I think.

25:33.411 --> 25:36.175
Yeah, and all these guys walking around like Al Capone.

25:36.395 --> 25:42.822
I don't want to take up too much of your time, because I know I have a book which speaks for itself.

25:43.262 --> 25:44.704
You're working on

25:45.190 --> 25:47.934
Well, I was working on it.

25:48.014 --> 25:55.243
And Bob Massey hasn't... What can I say?

25:55.423 --> 25:56.024
I don't know.

25:58.608 --> 26:05.417
I will certainly go back and work on that now because the contract still exists and it was set aside for this.

26:07.840 --> 26:10.303
I might do something else if...

26:10.840 --> 26:13.743
something else presents itself that I want to do as much as this.

26:13.763 --> 26:15.024
And I'm not being coy, honestly.

26:15.105 --> 26:15.565
I don't know.

26:16.987 --> 26:19.009
I would be happy going back and doing that.

26:19.289 --> 26:23.934
But this gave me... I remarried about four years ago.

26:23.954 --> 26:24.875
I have a three-year-old.

26:24.995 --> 26:29.059
That's given me a new sense of I'm not quite through yet.

26:29.480 --> 26:38.890
And I figure I still have another trip around with my tape recorder.

26:39.275 --> 26:41.277
if I can find the right subject.

26:41.297 --> 26:44.680
But I will finish Dreadnought eventually, because it's too good a story not to.

26:44.900 --> 26:47.502
And you will take it up to weight, up to how far?

26:47.522 --> 26:49.524
Well, originally, that's the point.

26:49.564 --> 26:53.867
It was really supposed to be one book, and Dreadnought got pretty long in it.

26:54.147 --> 27:09.180
What I wanted to do was the, what I saw originally was the arms race and the irony of all of the diplomatic havoc that this German decision to build a fleet caused.

27:09.650 --> 27:26.954
of dragging Britain out of splendid isolation and into alliance with France and Russia, and thereby, in effect, dooming Germany by building these ships and scaring the British, who had to have naval supremacy.

27:28.196 --> 27:30.900
They met once in Jutland.

27:30.920 --> 27:34.805
I mean, there were some preliminary battles there, but the main fleets met once.

27:34.825 --> 27:36.788
There was an indecisive,

27:37.342 --> 27:38.863
But the Germans never came out again.

27:39.324 --> 27:46.711
And two and a half years later, the German fleet was interned and then scuttled itself.

27:47.192 --> 27:51.196
You know, here are all of Kaiser's beautiful toys going bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo.

27:51.656 --> 28:05.830
And then a year later, because the world was totally different, the United States had begun building a major fleet, which incorporated all of the latest post-Jutland technology.

28:06.130 --> 28:14.642
The British, who were broke, agreed to the, what was called the 553 Naval Treaty.

28:14.662 --> 28:18.607
Britain and the United States could have, with Japan.

28:19.208 --> 28:22.973
So we could each have 15 battleships and the Japanese could have 10.

28:24.095 --> 28:29.923
And that meant scrapping 35 dreadnoughts that the British had built.

28:30.323 --> 28:34.669
So all of this stuff which had been built with the blood and sweat and

28:35.155 --> 28:40.821
tax money of the British taxpayers were sent off and carved up in the scrap metal.

28:40.841 --> 28:43.404
And I wanted to do that as a kind of irony.

28:43.785 --> 28:54.016
What happened was that I got very involved with all of the politics of Bismarck and Asquith and Irvine and what's his name?

28:54.036 --> 28:54.917
Sir Edward Gray.

28:54.957 --> 29:02.125
So the book got longer, and the theme of the Dreadnaughts got sort of

29:02.392 --> 29:03.954
layered and all this other stuff.

29:04.114 --> 29:06.418
Well, you wrote about 84 mini-biographies.

29:06.478 --> 29:06.999
Yeah.

29:07.279 --> 29:07.579
I did.

29:07.599 --> 29:08.160
I did.

29:08.220 --> 29:22.441
I'm very happy that the book was the way it was, but it was hard for anybody but a serious reader like you to deal with, because they didn't quite know what they were reading.

29:22.461 --> 29:26.747
I mean, there was an angry review in the Chicago Tribune by a Rear Admiral.

29:27.227 --> 29:31.133
He doesn't even mention the dreadnought until page 484.

29:31.349 --> 29:38.000
You know, the guy picks up the book, he wants to see Grey Steel.

29:39.342 --> 29:51.602
And then the Random House sales staff, when that book was, you know, to follow the metaphor, being launched and was on the kind of thing you were talking about.

29:52.443 --> 29:54.325
They said, this is a terrible title.

29:54.605 --> 29:56.567
Nobody could know what it means.

29:56.587 --> 29:57.588
It sounds nasty.

29:57.948 --> 29:58.469
Dreadnought.

29:59.130 --> 30:00.951
And I can't disagree more.

30:01.092 --> 30:06.177
I said to Loomis, I'll change it, just as you said, if you can come up with something better.

30:09.420 --> 30:14.745
So Loomis said, well, what about, you know... Battleship.

30:14.765 --> 30:16.987
No, he said, The King and the Kaiser.

30:17.007 --> 30:18.409
I said, that sounds like a soap opera.

30:18.429 --> 30:19.990
I mean, I was trying to be nice.

30:20.010 --> 30:20.931
He said, well, what about...

30:21.265 --> 30:23.848
Supremacy at Sea.

30:24.309 --> 30:28.954
I said, that sounds like a Bodice River, you know.

30:28.974 --> 30:37.504
And I was pretty sure, you know, when I finished Nicholas and Alexandra, Atheneum refused to let me call it that.

30:37.524 --> 30:39.947
They said, nobody will know who they are.

30:40.227 --> 30:41.208
Nobody's ever heard of them.

30:41.669 --> 30:42.870
It was true in those days.

30:43.110 --> 30:48.977
It was like writing a book and calling it, I can't think of a...

30:49.700 --> 30:56.528
because everybody knows who George and Martha are, but, you know, two people by first names that nobody's ever heard of.

30:57.509 --> 31:02.395
If you say, oh, you mean Nicholas II, the last czar, and his wife, who was called Alexandra.

31:02.936 --> 31:08.923
So I said, yeah, but I'm not going to, they wanted to call it the last days of, or the decline.

31:09.443 --> 31:12.547
And so what we did was what they wanted you to do.

31:14.129 --> 31:18.694
I got Nicholas and Alexandra, but it has a fairly large type of,

31:19.130 --> 31:27.419
subtitle, so that the guy... Now, not only is it well-known, but it's being ripped off.

31:28.139 --> 31:33.845
Everybody... I mean, it's a book out now of pictures called The Lost World of Nicholas and Alexandra.

31:33.865 --> 31:35.847
And, of course, you can't copyright a title.

31:35.867 --> 31:37.990
You can't copyright a title.

31:38.070 --> 31:39.611
But that's kind of a compliment, too.

31:41.553 --> 31:48.040
Yeah, well, it's a kind of... You know, if somebody is chasing your wife, that's a kind of compliment, too.

31:48.712 --> 31:52.407
Would you inscribe this for me, sir?

31:53.732 --> 31:58.350
Thank you.
