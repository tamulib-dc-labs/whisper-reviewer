WEBVTT

00:02.798 --> 00:03.279
to do.

00:03.419 --> 00:10.968
If they don't do it, they either, one, totally ignore it, or two, denigrate it.

00:11.148 --> 00:13.752
Well, then I like the fact that he never went to university, I guess.

00:13.912 --> 00:14.693
That is correct.

00:14.713 --> 00:17.757
That's how it all got started.

00:18.457 --> 00:25.466
But anyway, I love the whole, I love the verb of the, you were supposed to do, as I recollect, a second book on Shakespeare.

00:25.486 --> 00:31.894
Well, I have the better part of a manuscript on a second book on Shakespeare, but

00:32.347 --> 00:35.265
I've also done a book on Cardinio.

00:36.130 --> 00:39.370
That's The Lost Player, which I have discovered.

00:39.822 --> 00:42.666
Now, where did you discover Cardini?

00:42.926 --> 00:44.108
It's in the British Museum.

00:44.128 --> 00:45.489
It's all in his handwriting.

00:45.650 --> 00:46.571
Can I ask one thing?

00:46.591 --> 00:48.694
Do you mind if I tape record this interview, by the way?

00:48.774 --> 00:50.276
Sure, go ahead.

00:50.296 --> 00:53.079
I'm going to turn it on now because I need your permission to do that.

00:53.620 --> 00:54.001
Great.

00:54.021 --> 00:54.581
Okay, so go ahead.

00:54.601 --> 00:55.903
You found Cardini.

00:56.003 --> 00:57.846
I'm on now, by the way.

00:57.866 --> 00:59.828
Just print X but delete it.

00:59.948 --> 01:01.751
That's okay.

01:02.131 --> 01:04.474
I might turn out to be worse than Nixon.

01:04.554 --> 01:06.096
I just go by the numbers.

01:06.137 --> 01:06.978
That's all.

01:06.998 --> 01:07.298
Yes.

01:07.683 --> 01:08.245
Go ahead.

01:08.265 --> 01:11.717
You're talking about how you found Cardino in the British Museum, you're saying.

01:13.805 --> 01:14.146
Yes.

01:14.628 --> 01:15.431
How did you find it?

01:15.471 --> 01:18.381
Well, it has another name there.

01:18.562 --> 01:19.465
I won't...

01:20.120 --> 01:26.807
tell you its other name, but it has a name put on it by the censor.

01:26.827 --> 01:32.072
And it has no name, but it is entirely in Shakespeare's handwriting.

01:32.092 --> 01:35.155
And it is very characteristic of Shakespeare.

01:35.175 --> 01:36.256
How would you explain?

01:36.276 --> 01:50.110
About half of the play, which consists of two different plots, both of them taken from Cardinio, the story of Cardinio, called The Tale of Cardinio in Cervantes' Don Quixote.

01:50.512 --> 01:59.003
And one plot was handled by John Fletcher and the other by Shakespeare.

01:59.023 --> 01:59.404
Oh, yeah.

01:59.424 --> 02:01.206
Well, he worked with Fletcher towards the end.

02:01.226 --> 02:02.088
He did it in the eighth.

02:02.108 --> 02:02.929
Yes, he did.

02:02.949 --> 02:05.752
And he also did The Two Noble Kidsmen.

02:05.773 --> 02:06.654
That's right.

02:06.674 --> 02:08.056
Fletcher was pretty good, by the way.

02:08.156 --> 02:15.085
Fletcher was an excellent writer, and I'm sure that's the reason that Shakespeare, then living in semi-retirement, chose him.

02:15.335 --> 02:39.030
and you know one of the arguments might be well how come this is preserved in his hand and no other no other place that's a very that's a you might say we stay in the army a piss poor argument because the moment that uh uh hemmings and condell got the uh first folio into print they threw away the needless junk and clutter but like the original

02:39.010 --> 02:41.753
Now, they did not use this play.

02:41.773 --> 02:44.937
Sir Thomas More, which is partially in Shakespeare's handwriting.

02:44.957 --> 02:45.598
Yes, that's right.

02:45.618 --> 02:46.719
They did not use that.

02:46.739 --> 02:48.181
And that's why those survived.

02:48.701 --> 02:57.251
If they had printed those, no copy would survive in Shakespeare's handwriting or, in fact, in anybody else's handwriting.

02:57.271 --> 03:00.495
Because once a play was put into print,

03:00.982 --> 03:04.446
The original manuscript was juttisoned.

03:04.466 --> 03:04.986
It's worthless.

03:05.006 --> 03:09.151
Except for use as building fires or bottoming pies.

03:09.171 --> 03:10.933
I used it for bindings, too.

03:10.993 --> 03:13.956
Yeah, sometimes for padding out of binding.

03:14.637 --> 03:19.222
So anyway, I didn't mean to talk about Shakespeare, but this is fascinating.

03:19.242 --> 03:26.550
Anyway, my focus is bibliomania, but not necessarily in its...

03:27.307 --> 03:31.994
Not in the connotation of the kid they just arrested out in Iowa, for instance, who stole everything.

03:32.014 --> 03:36.220
I am kind of interested in the book collector.

03:36.240 --> 03:39.765
When I say book, by the way, I refer to the whole collector.

03:39.785 --> 03:41.207
It's the whole spectrum.

03:41.367 --> 03:53.424
But collectors who have been responsible and dealers and people who work on the institutional level for helping preserve the achievements, the great milestones of human thought.

03:53.625 --> 03:56.048
I don't mean to be...

03:56.500 --> 04:24.128
about this but there are some very great stories in collecting and this is kind of what i'm looking at and uh and uh great stories interesting stories you you certainly have been involved with any number of you you were talking about texas of course you're talking about jenkins i'm talking about well no i'm talking more about wolf feldman and harry ranson as a matter of fact well yeah their case was uh was very interesting i think i'm the first person that ever wrote

04:24.698 --> 04:26.080
an indictment of it.

04:26.100 --> 04:29.264
Yeah, well, that was really, I have to tell you, I'm going to be straight out.

04:29.304 --> 04:32.288
That's the number one thing I want to ask you about here today.

04:32.308 --> 04:37.134
Well, that's not one of the more important things I have done in the field.

04:37.154 --> 04:37.515
I understand.

04:37.715 --> 04:45.866
I have done a lot of things that have been sort of cataclysmic.

04:46.146 --> 04:53.676
You know, while a person is alive, you cannot attack him in the way I attacked Lou D. Feldman.

04:54.922 --> 04:58.545
Or Harry Ransom, for that matter.

04:58.565 --> 04:59.206
Yeah.

05:00.627 --> 05:10.596
But you cannot libel the debt, and therefore I felt free to use the information that I possessed and that I got from Feldman's former private secretary.

05:10.616 --> 05:11.357
Really?

05:11.377 --> 05:13.839
Who is a close friend of mine.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.801
I see her about every few days.

05:15.821 --> 05:20.866
I mean, she's not, you know, amorously connected.

05:20.886 --> 05:22.127
She's just a close friend.

05:22.394 --> 05:29.625
And she knew a tremendous amount about him and his peculations, which were numerous.

05:29.645 --> 05:30.246
What's your name?

05:30.326 --> 05:31.368
Can you tell me?

05:31.388 --> 05:31.528
What?

05:31.548 --> 05:33.792
Can you tell me the woman's name?

05:33.812 --> 05:36.135
Can I talk to her?

05:36.155 --> 05:37.357
I'll ask her if she'll talk to you.

05:37.437 --> 05:46.571
I'll tell you, because I am interested in how Texas, not only how they did what they did, but I am really interested in those early years.

05:46.652 --> 05:48.975
Aren't you more interested in Jenkins?

05:48.995 --> 05:50.157
Well, you know, the thing about...

05:50.440 --> 05:53.745
Well, can you tell me something about Jenkins?

05:53.945 --> 05:57.070
That hasn't been... Well, I'll tell you.

05:57.090 --> 06:00.035
I just got a letter today.

06:00.055 --> 06:02.699
This is part of the Jenkins thing.

06:02.719 --> 06:02.839
Okay.

06:02.859 --> 06:03.500
Which is still ongoing.

06:03.520 --> 06:04.682
You know he committed suicide.

06:04.702 --> 06:08.689
So they say, the guy in the New Yorker says he put a gun in the water.

06:08.769 --> 06:09.370
Isn't that ridiculous?

06:09.390 --> 06:11.152
Did you read that story?

06:11.333 --> 06:13.656
Yeah, I read it.

06:14.197 --> 06:15.399
He claims it was suicide.

06:15.599 --> 06:17.342
How can somebody shoot himself in the head?

06:17.778 --> 06:20.622
and the weapon be missing and it'd be suicide.

06:20.642 --> 06:21.684
But anyway, that's enough.

06:21.704 --> 06:24.768
There's a wonderful Sherlock Holmes story on that subject.

06:24.788 --> 06:26.991
I don't know whether you know it.

06:27.011 --> 06:45.979
But it involves a man who sets up a guy to be his murderer by writing a bogus note saying, which was in his pocket, asking him to

06:46.482 --> 06:52.838
meet his setup character on the bridge, on Thor Bridge.

06:53.159 --> 06:56.989
And I think it's the problem of Thor Bridge or something.

06:57.009 --> 06:58.051
That's interesting.

06:58.111 --> 07:00.096
You mentioned the letter that you got today.

07:00.177 --> 07:03.124
Yeah, well, in any event,

07:04.201 --> 07:23.125
In that particular story, the suicide who wants his victim to be blamed has a letter from the victim asking him to meet him at Thorbridge in his pocket when they find the body.

07:23.145 --> 07:33.178
And there is no gun, but there is a shot fired from the gun that is in this man's bureau or something.

07:34.458 --> 07:49.256
In any event, he simply rigs the guns with a weight so that after he shoots himself, the gun is pulled out of his hand by a stone and goes down deep into the river.

07:49.276 --> 07:51.920
I think they suggest that in the New Yorker piece, too.

07:52.100 --> 07:55.764
Well, I don't know whether they suggest that story about Thorough Bridge.

07:55.825 --> 07:59.229
No, they didn't, but I think they suggest a similar kind of premise.

07:59.569 --> 08:02.693
Well, in closed, this is from Dorothy Sloan Books.

08:03.432 --> 08:04.795
Did you interview her?

08:05.016 --> 08:05.818
No.

08:06.098 --> 08:06.940
All right.

08:06.981 --> 08:07.823
She's a book dealer?

08:08.083 --> 08:08.284
Yeah.

08:08.564 --> 08:12.374
Now, I understand she got a lot of the junk and stuff.

08:12.634 --> 08:17.847
I was approached about eight or ten years ago by a man named John Laughlin.

08:18.007 --> 08:19.551
I think he's in one of my books.

08:20.442 --> 08:21.424
Have you read about him?

08:21.844 --> 08:22.525
Yes, sir.

08:22.686 --> 08:23.988
Then he's not in the body.

08:24.268 --> 08:27.233
Did you read my book, Great Forgers and Famous Fates?

08:27.253 --> 08:27.774
Yes, I have that.

08:27.794 --> 08:28.996
That's a wonderful book.

08:29.356 --> 08:30.098
Well, C.F.

08:30.158 --> 08:33.904
John Laughlin, the man who forged Jean Lapite.

08:33.924 --> 08:34.364
Oh, yes.

08:34.384 --> 08:35.306
Okay.

08:35.386 --> 08:35.927
All right.

08:35.947 --> 08:36.989
Yes.

08:37.489 --> 08:38.451
Johnny Jenkins.

08:39.005 --> 08:54.986
who was a pompous asshole and who was very pretentious, wore a 10-gallon hat and boots and strutted around as though he actually did not have what he did have, the brains of a retarded paramecium.

08:55.006 --> 09:01.755
And he sold immense amounts of crap to the University of Texas.

09:02.427 --> 09:04.050
I think there was a kickback there.

09:04.070 --> 09:07.736
That's just my thought, but I'm not saying that there is.

09:07.756 --> 09:20.817
Why do you think that they bought, now you say that in your, in your, the antique madness, the auction madness book, particularly in that Feldman thing, that they bought a lot of junk.

09:21.418 --> 09:22.279
Yeah, they did.

09:22.299 --> 09:27.047
Why do you, I mean, were they stupid or they were just, no, they weren't stupid.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.110
They made a lot of, ransom and, uh,

09:29.377 --> 09:38.926
And Feldman made a lot of money, and no stupidity in that, except the fact that if you don't care how you make money, you can sure make a lot of it.

09:38.946 --> 09:40.487
There's no doubt about it.

09:40.507 --> 09:45.252
Now, what makes you so sure that Ransom and Feldman made a lot of money doing this?

09:45.892 --> 09:49.976
Feldman died almost a millionaire, if not a millionaire.

09:49.996 --> 09:52.738
But you connect one with the other, though.

09:52.819 --> 09:56.582
That he made money selling books to Feldman?

09:56.933 --> 10:13.354
I'm just trying to clarify the indictment here, because to use your word, you did say that, you know, you did indict the two in Creighton, and I am interested in following up on that, if I possibly could, if I possibly could on that.

10:13.495 --> 10:23.388
Well, let me, you see, Jenkins is the, claimed to be the successor of Feldman, and he was.

10:23.408 --> 10:25.270
In every respect, he was.

10:26.110 --> 10:29.393
And he was very proud of that fact.

10:29.413 --> 10:32.516
Somewhere I've got a letter that I wrote to somebody in Texas.

10:32.536 --> 10:33.757
I don't know where that letter is.

10:33.777 --> 10:45.707
It's a long letter explaining my relationship with Jenkins and my belief right from the beginning that he was an arsonist.

10:45.727 --> 10:54.835
What happened with Jenkins was that he bought from Lynn and Charlie Everstadt to...

10:55.608 --> 11:07.346
well-known New York dealers in Western Americana, and the West includes Texas, by extension, Texas is part of it.

11:07.887 --> 11:21.649
He bought from them for about, oh, a million and a half or two million dollars, which he borrowed from the bank, the balance of their stock, which comprised the things that the Eversets had been unable to sell to universities.

11:22.237 --> 11:35.253
They were unable to sell them because the universities, either one, already had a copy, or two, didn't want a copy because they felt it wasn't important enough.

11:35.273 --> 11:43.684
So he bought all that stuff, and he loaded it into a truck and took it out to Texas.

11:43.704 --> 11:46.067
He had borrowed the money for this from a bank.

11:47.448 --> 11:49.610
And they put up that kind of money?

11:49.630 --> 11:50.752
Then he'd try, yeah.

11:50.812 --> 11:56.879
Well, because this guy is a natural born native bullshitter.

11:56.899 --> 11:57.519
That's right.

11:57.539 --> 12:04.127
Of the Baren von Munchausen variety.

12:04.147 --> 12:09.733
And then he made the awful discovery that an awful lot of it would be duplicates.

12:09.813 --> 12:10.534
Jesus.

12:10.594 --> 12:13.457
That the universities already had.

12:13.477 --> 12:16.881
Which, of course, he wasn't smart enough to realize in the beginning.

12:17.198 --> 12:26.969
And therefore, he loaded up one big garage, storage garage, with these rare volumes and set fire to it.

12:26.989 --> 12:28.991
That is my opinion.

12:29.152 --> 12:34.317
And he was being investigated for arson, you know, at the time of his death.

12:34.337 --> 12:34.618
Is that right?

12:34.658 --> 12:39.083
But not content with that, he burned another lot.

12:39.363 --> 12:41.746
Well, he had this fully insured.

12:42.046 --> 12:44.169
Oh, yes, of course.

12:44.669 --> 12:46.311
And...

12:47.270 --> 12:52.798
The second lot really roused the insurance company.

12:53.019 --> 12:55.182
I mean, they'd only been suspicious at the first one.

12:55.202 --> 12:59.268
They hadn't come to me, or I could have told them some stories about it.

12:59.288 --> 13:01.531
And I wasn't about to tell on anybody anyway.

13:01.551 --> 13:04.095
I wouldn't be telling you this if he were still alive.

13:04.175 --> 13:09.723
But now, how is it that you have access to this information when you say they don't?

13:09.743 --> 13:11.786
I mean, your sources?

13:11.806 --> 13:12.487
Well, I don't know.

13:12.507 --> 13:15.572
It's just things that you know.

13:15.805 --> 13:23.795
I knew the Everstats very well, and I knew how hard they tried to sell all that stuff before they sold it to Johnny Jenkins.

13:23.975 --> 13:25.778
Well, here's a letter now.

13:26.098 --> 13:33.027
Jenkins had bought the papers of Jean Lafitte, all forged by John Laughlin.

13:33.047 --> 13:40.356
Now, I wrote to Jenkins at the time, and I told him that he was the owner of the biggest collection of forgeries in Texas.

13:40.377 --> 13:44.682
Whereupon, he sold a lot of them to Governor Price Daniels.

13:45.438 --> 13:50.729
another retarded individual who didn't bother to check.

13:50.749 --> 13:55.920
He didn't go to any handwriting expert to find out if these were Lafitte documents.

13:55.940 --> 13:57.844
No sir, he just bought them all.

13:57.864 --> 14:04.056
And then he boasted that he had a big collection of forgeries when he discovered that Jenkins had stuck him.

14:04.096 --> 14:05.860
But Jenkins also stuck

14:06.532 --> 14:08.316
various universities.

14:08.336 --> 14:16.313
The University of Texas has the last letter ever written from the Alamo, which, by the way, was forged by John Laughlin.

14:16.333 --> 14:18.237
And they were very proud of that.

14:18.257 --> 14:20.001
You've examined these and determined

14:20.302 --> 14:21.543
that there were forgeries, right?

14:21.623 --> 14:22.204
Yeah.

14:22.224 --> 14:23.225
I mean, you're seeing this now.

14:23.265 --> 14:26.168
I didn't see the original, but I don't need to.

14:26.188 --> 14:33.055
I can smell Stilson cheese anytime when I even get my nose within 50 feet of it.

14:33.155 --> 14:37.219
And I also know Laughlin's writing and his style and his handwriting.

14:39.522 --> 14:42.205
So they get stuck with the... Yeah.

14:42.225 --> 14:47.490
Now, this poor woman named Dorothy Sloan, who seems to be a very nice person, I've never met her.

14:48.365 --> 14:59.537
She acquired, I think from Jenkins, a lot of his turkeys that he had not sacrificed for Thanksgiving.

14:59.577 --> 15:05.923
These things that she got, she issued some catalogs, huh?

15:06.204 --> 15:07.926
I've seen her catalogs, too.

15:07.946 --> 15:11.950
Yeah, very beautiful catalogs.

15:11.970 --> 15:13.191
Now, as I understand it,

15:13.492 --> 15:25.806
Despite the fact that my book, Great Forgers and Famous Fakes, is readily available to her and has a whole chapter on Laughlin, she apparently did not use that.

15:26.066 --> 15:41.063
And she did not realize that Johnny Jenkins was a sneak, a liar, a cheat, a thief, a crook, a forger, and a few more that you might throw in in addition to arsonists.

15:41.083 --> 15:42.164
Did you ever met the guy?

15:42.184 --> 15:42.925
I never met him.

15:43.917 --> 15:49.104
But he had a very low opinion of me, I hardly need say.

15:49.124 --> 15:54.911
I was the one who had condemned these fine lapide documents as fake.

15:54.991 --> 15:58.556
These guys must really, really be fearful of you.

15:58.576 --> 16:02.081
Because you're the wild card in this.

16:02.121 --> 16:03.883
You're the one element they can't count on.

16:04.184 --> 16:07.147
I'm not corruptible, if that's what you mean.

16:07.167 --> 16:09.350
No, that's right.

16:09.590 --> 16:18.820
I start with that at the outset, but what I'm saying is they fear the fact that, you know, they're trying to put out a Hitler diary and they're trying to put out the Mormon stuff.

16:18.860 --> 16:21.303
Okay, now here's what happened.

16:21.823 --> 16:25.127
See, this is what I have heard, and you will have to check this out with her.

16:25.147 --> 16:27.269
Do not quote me on this, please.

16:27.409 --> 16:32.655
Because it's just what I heard today, and that is that Dorothy Sloan,

16:33.361 --> 16:51.063
authenticated a lot of these forged John Lafitte documents for Simpson's Auction House in Houston, Texas.

16:51.083 --> 17:02.477
One of the documents was sold to a man named Bill Head, and he is now complaining and threatening to sue Simpson.

17:02.497 --> 17:03.098
Now,

17:03.449 --> 17:11.877
A lot of these documents were bought by heritage book stores.

17:11.998 --> 17:20.126
I think that's in, I think that's run by a man named Tom Lingenfeld.

17:20.866 --> 17:22.368
Is that in Texas?

17:22.388 --> 17:26.652
No, that's in Philadelphia.

17:26.672 --> 17:26.772
Okay.

17:26.792 --> 17:31.617
Now, here's a letter that I just got from

17:32.626 --> 17:40.415
Dorothy Sloan, whom I never met and never corresponded with to the best of my knowledge.

17:40.575 --> 17:41.937
I got it just this morning.

17:41.977 --> 17:46.802
Dear Mr. Hamilton, enclosed as a Xerox copy of a manuscript I'd like to be by Jean Lafitte.

17:46.883 --> 17:49.405
This document was sent to me by Mr. Bill Head.

17:49.425 --> 17:51.167
How do we spell that?

17:51.188 --> 17:51.648
H-E-A-D?

17:51.788 --> 17:53.310
Yeah, she gives his address.

17:53.450 --> 17:54.271
Okay, what's his address?

17:54.571 --> 17:55.933
Well, I...

17:56.740 --> 17:58.803
Okay, I can ask, but you can just say no.

17:58.823 --> 17:59.744
No, no.

17:59.764 --> 18:03.029
Well, you wouldn't get an answer, you know, from most people.

18:03.410 --> 18:07.035
So don't be so confident that you can ferret these things out.

18:07.355 --> 18:09.719
I will give you his telephone number.

18:09.739 --> 18:09.839
Okay.

18:09.859 --> 18:15.567
But only use what he tells you.

18:15.587 --> 18:16.268
Okay, sure.

18:16.687 --> 18:19.914
His telephone number is 713-530-5131.

18:20.054 --> 18:23.100
Okay, let's continue with the letter.

18:23.121 --> 18:23.642
All right.

18:23.762 --> 18:28.372
Mr. Head, purchase this document from Simpson's Auction House in Houston, Texas.

18:28.392 --> 18:31.438
Mr. Head, ask me to examine this document to see if it is genuine.

18:32.330 --> 18:42.122
Since this document may become part of a legal proceeding, I advise Mr. Head that he should obtain a legal opinion from you since you are the acknowledged expert on Lafitte.

18:42.142 --> 18:46.807
I sent Mr. Head a copy of your chapter on Lafitte and Great Forges and Famous Fits.

18:46.927 --> 18:50.372
I will be interested to hear what you think about this document.

18:50.392 --> 18:55.618
I never entered this business thinking it would be totally carefree.

18:55.638 --> 18:56.259
Carefree?

18:56.279 --> 18:56.919
Carefree.

18:56.939 --> 18:58.041
What the hell is that sound?

18:58.061 --> 18:59.843
Is that your teeth?

18:59.863 --> 19:00.023
No.

19:00.043 --> 19:00.424
Okay.

19:00.504 --> 19:01.645
No, it's not.

19:02.047 --> 19:03.951
I don't know what it is.

19:03.971 --> 19:05.896
After a while, you get used to these remarks.

19:05.916 --> 19:08.161
Okay.

19:08.181 --> 19:08.842
Take it.

19:08.963 --> 19:13.332
But the past few years have been more than I bargained for.

19:13.453 --> 19:19.887
That poor thing, I want to tell you, if there ever was created by God or by Satan,

19:20.508 --> 19:32.925
any business more cutthroats, more villainous, more underhanded, more backbiting than autograph, manuscript, and rare book dealing, I would like to know about it.

19:33.246 --> 19:41.157
I once talked to Phil Seng, who was one of the greatest collectors of this century.

19:41.458 --> 19:48.928
Sotheby's sold his collection in about six different volumes of autographs, but

19:50.107 --> 19:59.441
He said to me, I'm in the ice cream business, and I've made my money in the ice cream business.

19:59.461 --> 20:07.252
And I always thought that the ice cream business was the most cutthroat business ever conceived.

20:07.272 --> 20:09.816
But now I see that I was wrong.

20:09.916 --> 20:14.783
I perceive that the autograph business is much more cutthroat.

20:14.803 --> 20:19.270
And that came impromptu without any remark from me on the suggestion.

20:20.836 --> 20:24.181
How did she end the letter?

20:24.301 --> 20:27.887
Because I don't know where she ended.

20:28.408 --> 20:30.150
Here's the end of her letter.

20:30.491 --> 20:35.358
I never entered this business thinking it would be totally carefree.

20:35.378 --> 20:39.705
But the past few years have been more than I bargained for.

20:39.725 --> 20:41.968
You know, I feel sorry for her.

20:41.988 --> 20:47.637
Because anybody who sits down and thinks that this is a gentle hobby...

20:48.207 --> 21:16.628
is just uh wearing more of a blindfold than justice ever wore now this is you talking now yep okay don't forget i'm not we're not sitting face to face and i can't see the document so i want to know where the document name is it where you well if it was a document andrew then bargained for she doesn't put it the way i would but i'll tell you the whole history of uh the collecting

21:16.912 --> 21:26.533
of manuscripts and rare books as one of villainy, of lies, fraud, cheating, stealing, and

21:26.767 --> 21:30.112
It is an exciting thing.

21:30.512 --> 21:32.095
It is truly exciting.

21:32.235 --> 21:34.678
You've just given me a wonderful quote, you know.

21:34.839 --> 21:47.577
It is not something that is for soporific bespectacled scholars with gold-headed canes who sit down and...

21:48.198 --> 21:56.177
I was going to say browse, but ruminate over a volume of ancient poetry.

21:56.197 --> 22:03.675
What is it that Poe says, are many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore?

22:03.925 --> 22:04.786
It isn't that.

22:05.227 --> 22:13.059
Before you ever get to that quaint, curious volume, you've got to go over the bodies of your adversaries.

22:13.139 --> 22:14.021
Why is this?

22:14.041 --> 22:16.244
Can you give me an explanation for this?

22:16.264 --> 22:18.107
Because there's a lot of money in them.

22:18.207 --> 22:18.888
Is it money?

22:18.908 --> 22:20.130
Just money?

22:20.150 --> 22:20.831
No, no.

22:21.192 --> 22:21.813
Oh, no.

22:21.833 --> 22:25.298
You've got to have the damn virus in your blood.

22:25.438 --> 22:28.583
Once you get poisoned by the love for rare books,

22:29.221 --> 22:30.802
I'll tell you something.

22:31.583 --> 22:35.967
This is exactly the stuff I want to talk about, by the way.

22:35.987 --> 22:36.808
You're doing wonderfully.

22:36.828 --> 22:38.249
That's why I'm not asking any questions.

22:38.270 --> 22:39.050
I'm just letting you talk.

22:39.070 --> 22:51.582
John Fleming said to me, John Fleming had just come back from an auction sale in London.

22:51.602 --> 22:57.928
And he said, we were sitting, finishing off a bottle of booze,

22:58.482 --> 23:11.857
I quit drinking about three years ago, so I'm one of these uninteresting teetotalers now.

23:11.877 --> 23:16.102
And he said, I bought a letter of John Keats.

23:16.122 --> 23:17.784
I said, what did it set you back?

23:17.804 --> 23:20.487
He said, $27,500.

23:20.507 --> 23:22.870
I said, it must be a good letter.

23:23.137 --> 23:24.919
He said, no.

23:24.939 --> 23:26.821
In fact, it's a very poor letter.

23:26.841 --> 23:29.884
It's only a two-page letter to his sister, Fanny.

23:30.524 --> 23:37.631
His sister, Fanny, has the same name as Fanny Braun, but not Braun for her last name.

23:37.651 --> 23:42.696
And he said, Keith just talked about how he hasn't been feeling well.

23:42.976 --> 23:50.504
So I said, John, why in the hell did you pay $27,500 for him?

23:50.524 --> 23:52.085
He said, oh.

23:52.105 --> 23:52.806
He said, uh,

23:53.326 --> 24:04.221
Uh, I called up, uh, oh, let me think of the guy.

24:04.241 --> 24:05.203
He's a New Jersey collector, a very pompous man.

24:05.223 --> 24:09.629
Um, well, anyhow, I'll think of the name later, maybe, and if I do, I'll tell you.

24:09.649 --> 24:16.919
He said, I called him up, and, uh, you know he's the great Keats collector, now that, uh, Forsheimer's gone.

24:17.019 --> 24:18.321
I said, yes, I know that.

24:18.875 --> 24:25.564
He said, well, I called him up and told him I was going to London, and I'd be delighted to bid on this letter for it.

24:25.584 --> 24:31.812
And he said, no, I have engaged somebody else to bid on that.

24:31.832 --> 24:37.600
So I said to myself, this is John Speedy, I said to myself, isn't that tough for you?

24:38.121 --> 24:42.727
I'm going to get that letter, and you're not going to have it, and I don't care what I pay for it.

24:42.747 --> 24:45.591
He said, that explains why I paid so much for it.

24:46.229 --> 24:48.351
Well, it was a genuine letter, though.

24:48.652 --> 24:49.072
Oh, yeah.

24:49.092 --> 24:51.034
The letter was fine.

24:51.094 --> 24:57.501
But in one of my books, I think it's in Great Forges and Famous Spakes, I'd tell a story about Dr. Rosenbach.

24:57.521 --> 24:58.662
I'm sure you've read about him.

24:58.682 --> 24:59.102
Oh, indeed.

24:59.383 --> 25:01.245
I've been down to interview Ed Wolfe, by the way.

25:01.265 --> 25:07.331
So I already talked to Edwin Wolfe in Philadelphia about his Rosenbach book and stuff.

25:07.371 --> 25:07.891
So go ahead.

25:07.911 --> 25:09.533
Tell him about the doctor.

25:13.017 --> 25:13.197
Okay.

25:13.217 --> 25:13.317
So...

25:13.769 --> 25:16.353
Fleming acquired Rosenbach stock.

25:17.514 --> 25:29.631
And I was doing this book on forgeries, and I said, John, have you got any old forgeries kicking around that I might be able to allude to or use in my book?

25:29.651 --> 25:32.815
And he said, do you want something of cozy?

25:32.835 --> 25:34.317
I said, yes, please.

25:34.397 --> 25:38.663
I said, I have a huge supply of cozy stuff, but I need more.

25:38.845 --> 25:40.667
and more and more.

25:40.687 --> 25:42.710
He said, just a minute, I got something.

25:42.730 --> 25:56.268
So he got up and he brought me an envelope and it said, Poe Forgeries by Cozy in that tiny cramped handwriting of Dr. R. And I said, who wrote this?

25:56.288 --> 25:59.232
He said, why, Dr. R wrote that.

25:59.252 --> 26:04.879
And I pulled out one of them and it was Poe's handwriting.

26:05.059 --> 26:05.680
And I

26:06.706 --> 26:08.749
I said, may I take these with me?

26:08.809 --> 26:10.652
He said, you can have them.

26:10.672 --> 26:11.814
Charles, take them with you.

26:12.455 --> 26:14.338
You can keep them.

26:14.358 --> 26:21.730
So I went back to my office before calling him, and then I called him, and I said, you have two genuine letters of Edgar Allan Poe.

26:21.990 --> 26:23.192
And he said, what are they worth?

26:23.252 --> 26:27.299
And I said, between $5,000 and $10,000 for the pair.

26:27.319 --> 26:29.262
This was a long time ago.

26:29.362 --> 26:34.570
And John said, well...

26:35.005 --> 26:37.007
Do you want to bring them back?

26:37.668 --> 26:39.350
Do you want me to send over for them?

26:39.450 --> 26:44.896
And I said, John, since I discovered that they're opposed, maybe you'll let me sell them for you at auction.

26:44.916 --> 26:46.658
He said, sure, go ahead.

26:46.678 --> 26:51.083
And I think they brought something like $7,500 or $8,000.

26:51.783 --> 26:56.649
But you see, Dr. Rosenbach thought they were forgeries.

26:56.849 --> 27:01.654
That confirms what a lot of people say about Dr. R is that he was a big showman, but he really...

27:02.242 --> 27:06.272
He was very much like Johnny Jenkins and like Lou D. Feldman.

27:06.512 --> 27:10.402
You know, as some people have said, you couldn't compare him.

27:10.422 --> 27:14.391
He and Krauss, for instance, Krauss was a bookman who knew books up and down.

27:14.952 --> 27:16.376
I never liked Krauss at all.

27:16.416 --> 27:17.719
Have you looked at his book?

27:17.699 --> 27:20.322
It's a pompous book, yeah.

27:20.342 --> 27:21.804
Pompous is hardly the word.

27:22.285 --> 27:23.927
Why I will be remembered.

27:24.207 --> 27:26.550
You know, I'll tell you something about that.

27:26.710 --> 27:32.897
The only other man who ever did anything that insane was Nietzsche, who wrote a chapter.

27:32.917 --> 27:36.301
Why I am such a great man.

27:36.321 --> 27:39.085
Look at the wonderful things I've done.

27:39.105 --> 27:39.285
Yeah.

27:39.535 --> 27:41.597
But he spent all that aside.

27:41.617 --> 27:43.239
He was very knowledgeable.

27:43.259 --> 27:44.280
I did not think so.

27:44.381 --> 27:45.442
Really?

27:45.662 --> 27:47.364
I never found him to be knowledgeable.

27:47.384 --> 27:55.053
I found him to be loud-mouthed and reasonably ignorant.

27:55.213 --> 27:59.978
I know that there are some fairly knowledgeable people in this field.

28:00.759 --> 28:01.480
Who do you respect?

28:01.500 --> 28:03.603
Let's start with that.

28:03.623 --> 28:03.723
What?

28:03.743 --> 28:05.745
Who do you respect as knowledgeable?

28:06.113 --> 28:14.402
Well, I think very highly of my friend Ken Rendell because... I'm going to see Ken Friday, by the way.

28:14.422 --> 28:14.522
Yeah.

28:14.742 --> 28:21.129
And I think quite highly of Mary Benjamin, too.

28:21.349 --> 28:24.432
I just got a letter from her today.

28:24.452 --> 28:28.877
She's supposed to be quite an interesting person.

28:28.897 --> 28:30.799
I think I'll have to get in touch with her.

28:30.819 --> 28:33.522
And I think quite highly of Paul Richards.

28:33.974 --> 28:36.757
I just saw Paul at the New York Fair.

28:36.837 --> 28:39.100
I was down at the New York Fair.

28:39.120 --> 28:40.882
Has he taken off any of that weight?

28:41.142 --> 28:41.342
No.

28:42.664 --> 28:43.665
No, he hasn't.

28:43.845 --> 28:47.549
In fact, we're going to go up to Gardner and see him in a couple of weeks.

28:47.569 --> 28:49.051
He's up in Gardner now.

28:49.071 --> 28:53.215
So I've been hitting all the autograph guys lately, which is very interesting.

28:53.235 --> 28:56.639
Well, you'll find that they are an interesting guy.

28:56.659 --> 28:58.561
Are you a cynical man, Mr. Hamilton?

28:58.661 --> 28:59.702
No, I'm not.

28:59.722 --> 29:02.886
Why do you say when you talk about cheats and lies and fakes?

29:02.906 --> 29:03.947
I was just saying to my secretary,

29:04.349 --> 29:17.481
my assistant, about an hour or two hours ago, I said that the tragic flaw in my character is that I trust everyone.

29:17.501 --> 29:19.923
And I do.

29:20.184 --> 29:21.545
I trust people.

29:22.386 --> 29:29.192
And I do not denigrate living people.

29:29.212 --> 29:31.054
It is just a policy I have.

29:31.074 --> 29:32.635
Now, did you know Lou Feldman?

29:33.357 --> 29:34.098
Yes, I did.

29:34.118 --> 29:36.360
Because you really, you really... I knew him.

29:36.380 --> 29:38.302
I have to say, you tear him apart in this book.

29:38.402 --> 29:40.984
Yeah, he was a disgusting individual.

29:41.004 --> 29:42.446
Why do you say that?

29:43.427 --> 29:44.628
Well... See, I never knew him.

29:44.648 --> 29:46.430
I knew nothing about him.

29:46.590 --> 29:51.334
First of all, he was extraordinarily pompous.

29:51.655 --> 30:01.844
And when he bit at auction, he used to yell, Up!

30:01.864 --> 30:02.525
Up!

30:02.545 --> 30:02.605
Up!

30:03.614 --> 30:06.878
And I used to think, up you two, you bastard.

30:07.398 --> 30:12.524
Because he had such an air of scorn about him.

30:12.544 --> 30:17.050
His lips were constantly curled in contempt.

30:17.070 --> 30:20.233
Contempt of worms like you and me.

30:21.214 --> 30:32.187
Ah, but important people like Krauss would cause a little smile of congeniality and comradeship to come over his lips.

30:32.740 --> 30:42.128
because he and Kraus, believe me, were fired in the same kiln.

30:42.208 --> 30:47.233
The difference between them was only in the name.

30:47.253 --> 30:49.155
They were very, very much alike.

30:49.175 --> 30:53.939
They were both bullslingers.

30:54.159 --> 31:02.106
And Kraus never had any interest in anything that didn't have dollar signs on it.

31:02.440 --> 31:06.625
If you read his book, that's all you're going to see is dollars.

31:06.645 --> 31:07.225
Yes, that's a fact.

31:07.245 --> 31:16.856
And yet, you have been talking to me now for half an hour that, by the way, I can ill spare, and I don't think at any time I've mentioned money.

31:17.517 --> 31:17.898
No, you haven't.

31:17.918 --> 31:20.060
Because I never cared about it.

31:20.080 --> 31:24.685
That's the reason I'm so poor and why I went bankrupt, because I never cared about money.

31:24.805 --> 31:26.647
I saw your fee schedule.

31:26.667 --> 31:28.810
I said, which I think is very reasonable.

31:28.830 --> 31:31.553
I mean, you're the best in the world at it, so...

31:32.157 --> 31:37.984
But that's... So let's nail down now this... Can we go back to Lou Falk?

31:38.144 --> 31:40.127
Did you ever have any dealings with him?

31:40.347 --> 31:43.891
Did you ever cross each other's paths professionally?

31:43.911 --> 31:45.734
Yes.

31:46.254 --> 31:55.545
When I first started in the autograph business as a dealer, I had been around autographs from the time I was nine years old.

31:55.565 --> 32:00.932
When I first started as a dealer about 1949 or 50,

32:01.975 --> 32:16.592
I had a beautiful six-page letter of Mark Twain in which he described writing his book Roughing It, and he wrote a mock introduction for roughing it that was hilariously funny.

32:16.712 --> 32:30.649
And I offered this to Feldman for $35, and he wrote me a nasty letter saying that I had overpriced it and why didn't I learn something about my merchandise before I offered it around and so on and so forth.

32:31.523 --> 32:36.308
And with that letter, he made an enemy of me.

32:36.328 --> 32:43.195
However, I was not an active enemy, as I am never an active enemy.

32:43.215 --> 32:44.376
I just didn't like the man.

32:44.516 --> 32:50.202
But I continued in a desultory sort of way to do business with him.

32:50.222 --> 32:56.248
And he had a customer for Conan Doyle's stuff.

32:56.633 --> 32:59.736
Yeah, he was supposed to be, I thought I was supposed to be an expert on that.

32:59.756 --> 33:24.542
Yeah, but he didn't know anything about Sherlock Holmes or Conan Doyle because I talked to him a number of times and he had a very extensive knowledge of almost nothing relative to Sherlock Holmes.

33:24.642 --> 33:26.404
And I, who had read the stories,

33:27.430 --> 33:45.297
at least half a dozen times each, and who was familiar with Conan Doyle's life and who was a very close friend to Basil Rathmore, who, by the way, hated Holmes, I think without any good reason.

33:45.317 --> 33:52.408
I once said to Basil, I said, you've got a nerve to hate the man who's made you immortal.

33:53.907 --> 34:04.564
But, of course, Rathbone was all wrapped up in Shakespeare, which was the reason why we liked each other, I guess.

34:04.584 --> 34:14.619
Anyhow, I never respected his knowledge, and I never found out from whence it was derived.

34:15.240 --> 34:22.311
You say in your book you could never understand how the New York Public Library, for instance, would give their option bids to Feldman.

34:22.831 --> 34:30.341
No, that was a terrible error because, of course, he cheated them out of tens of thousands of dollars.

34:30.361 --> 34:31.903
Do you know this or do you say this?

34:31.923 --> 34:32.965
Oh, no, I know it.

34:33.345 --> 34:34.186
How do you know this?

34:34.206 --> 34:41.536
I know that because when Feldman was in the auction room, you knew that the prices were going to be out of line.

34:41.556 --> 34:49.066
Now, it is a very simple thing to do to commit such a fraud if you're dealing with a retarded person like a librarian.

34:50.188 --> 34:52.551
For example...

34:53.257 --> 35:18.150
If the library says to you, Mr. Hamilton, we would like to get a manuscript that's coming up for sale, it's an eight-page manuscript of Wilkie Collins, which appears to be the, I'm making this up, the first hint of a,

35:18.586 --> 35:28.000
detective novel that he never got around to write, and it predates by about five years, The Woman in White.

35:28.100 --> 35:33.768
So we think, you know, it is quite important.

35:33.788 --> 35:36.052
What do you think it will bring?

35:36.072 --> 35:46.687
So I find that the auction house has an estimate of $400 on it, which is a record price for Wilkie College.

35:46.707 --> 35:47.749
So I say, well,

35:48.067 --> 35:56.997
I'll tell you, I checked around and I found out there was a lot of interest in it, and I think I may be able to get it for you for around $5,000.

35:57.097 --> 35:58.578
Jesus.

35:58.598 --> 36:04.124
So, they say, Jesus, that's a lot of money, like you did.

36:04.144 --> 36:06.827
And you say, yes, but think of the importance.

36:06.847 --> 36:15.697
It will go marvelously with your Dickens-Collinson, because you know how close Collins and Dickens were, and so on.

36:15.717 --> 36:15.897
So...

36:17.429 --> 36:20.552
They okay that.

36:20.572 --> 36:31.081
Then I go to the auction and my sidekick in another part of the room bids me up.

36:31.101 --> 36:43.352
Without me bidding and without my assistant or sidekick bidding me up, it would have been sold for $3,500 and I would have received by 10%, $35.

36:43.372 --> 36:47.335
However, we bid it up to $6,000.

36:47.872 --> 36:56.361
And I then get a commission of $600, of which I give $50 to the guy who bid me way up to $6,000.

36:56.381 --> 37:06.672
And then I call up the library and I congratulate them on this magnificent acquisition of this unique Wilkie Collins document.

37:06.692 --> 37:09.535
That is the way it's done.

37:09.876 --> 37:13.339
And you say this is what they did with Texas as well?

37:13.359 --> 37:14.180
No, no, no.

37:14.240 --> 37:15.702
They didn't do this with Texas.

37:16.407 --> 37:24.101
With Texas, Ransom had the right to put through any purchase he considered suitable.

37:24.141 --> 37:36.964
Therefore, when Joe Shlobotnik, the rhymester who is so good at blank bursts and who doesn't know a sonnet from a triolet,

37:37.231 --> 38:02.935
uh down in Greenwich Village uh decides he is going to sell all his fine manuscripts all the manuscripts of his great poems Slobotnik would go to uh Lou D Feldman who would say look this stuff is all crap this isn't good poetry this is terrible stuff did you get any of it published guys say yeah I had one

38:03.218 --> 38:13.691
poem published in my high school annual in Hoboken.

38:14.112 --> 38:15.614
That is a hypothetical story.

38:15.634 --> 38:18.778
It's a hypothetical story, but this is exactly what they did.

38:18.798 --> 38:22.082
And if you doubt me, take a look at their archives there.

38:22.102 --> 38:30.913
So Feldman would shell out the $40 or whatever it was for the entire collection.

38:31.433 --> 38:44.870
Then he and Ransom would promote the collection to the University of Texas, and they would sell it for $25,000.

38:45.191 --> 38:52.019
The complete literary works, all in manuscript, much of it never published.

38:52.180 --> 38:58.808
Joe Slobotnik, the distinguished Greenwich Village poet who has...

38:59.294 --> 39:06.482
by the, in the view of all critics, taken over the position once held by E.E.

39:06.502 --> 39:10.347
Cummings, who also lived in the village.

39:10.367 --> 39:17.014
I think Cummings lived on that, what's that, McDoodle, something or other down there.

39:17.034 --> 39:18.656
As did Mary Ann Moore.

39:18.676 --> 39:22.380
Can I ask you a question?

39:22.400 --> 39:26.886
Is this the scuttlebutt you hear in the circles, or do you say you know this for fact?

39:26.906 --> 39:29.048
No, this is the stuff I get from Feldman's secretary.

39:29.804 --> 39:32.768
Did she actually tell you this stuff?

39:33.088 --> 39:33.949
Yeah, she knew what he was doing.

39:33.969 --> 39:36.452
She wasn't loyal to him at all?

39:36.472 --> 39:38.294
Why should she be?

39:38.314 --> 39:39.556
He was brutal to her.

39:39.576 --> 39:43.961
Oh, the man was a despicable man.

39:44.141 --> 39:46.004
I mean, brutal in what respect?

39:46.024 --> 39:47.325
You didn't pay her or you didn't treat her well?

39:47.345 --> 39:50.229
You didn't treat her well.

39:50.329 --> 39:53.453
And she told you this stuff after he was dead or while he was alive?

39:53.473 --> 39:55.295
She told it to me while he was alive.

39:56.436 --> 39:57.077
And, uh,

39:57.614 --> 39:59.096
I never did anything with it.

39:59.116 --> 40:04.403
I'm not going to, I don't say anything about living people.

40:04.463 --> 40:08.448
I don't like, I don't think that's, you know, it's not proper.

40:08.568 --> 40:09.389
It's not government.

40:09.409 --> 40:11.612
It's not too safe either.

40:11.652 --> 40:19.182
No, when a person is dead, then their spirit can pay the reckoning.

40:19.302 --> 40:21.345
But I'm not going to tax a living person.

40:21.365 --> 40:24.249
Now, did you have any dealings with Harry Ransom while he was alive?

40:24.349 --> 40:25.410
I never knew the man.

40:26.082 --> 40:28.346
I don't know anything at all about it.

40:28.366 --> 40:29.367
That's what I've said.

40:29.387 --> 40:34.515
Okay, but what you're suggesting then about ransom making a killing is what you've heard from the secretary.

40:35.436 --> 40:38.982
Yes, and also it is something that's well known.

40:39.042 --> 40:41.746
Even the University of Texas admits it.

40:41.846 --> 40:45.833
Well, I just spent four days down there, and I couldn't get them to admit anything like that.

40:45.853 --> 40:47.095
You know, I mean, I tried.

40:47.135 --> 40:48.717
You tried, and they wouldn't admit it?

40:48.737 --> 40:50.480
They wouldn't even let me see the letters.

40:50.500 --> 40:51.341
I wouldn't recognize it.

40:51.361 --> 40:53.845
Why, of course they would, because they've got nothing to hide.

40:54.145 --> 41:04.018
Well, they're trying to project an image now of a major international research library, which in many respects they are.

41:04.058 --> 41:06.862
You certainly have to say that everything isn't worthless in that library.

41:06.882 --> 41:09.005
I don't think you mean to suggest that, do you?

41:09.025 --> 41:10.426
Oh, I certainly don't.

41:10.487 --> 41:12.689
They have a wonderful collection.

41:12.709 --> 41:14.111
But they did buy a lot of junk.

41:14.792 --> 41:19.318
They bought a lot of bogus stuff from Jenkins.

41:19.398 --> 41:22.262
Jenkins did a lot of printing.

41:23.052 --> 41:29.521
As you know, you evidently aren't very familiar with that case, and that is a great case.

41:29.541 --> 41:32.265
Well, the thing of it is, I haven't been pursuing it.

41:32.285 --> 41:36.191
The stories I am pursuing are stories that really haven't been written.

41:36.231 --> 41:41.078
The Jenkins case has been done in The New Yorker, and I almost feel that I'll be covering territory.

41:41.834 --> 41:45.500
that's been covered, but, you know, you did give me some very interesting leads at the beginning.

41:45.521 --> 41:52.613
Well, the New Yorker never talked to me, and they lost a major source of information.

41:52.633 --> 42:06.778
For example, the first catalog I ever got from Jenkins was devoted entirely to John F. Kennedy, and more particularly, it was 90 percent autographic.

42:07.822 --> 42:20.645
And a careful examination of this catalog revealed that not one single example of John F. Kennedy in this catalog was genuine.

42:20.665 --> 42:25.915
That they were all secretarial fakes or auto pens.

42:26.519 --> 42:31.388
I never wrote to him about it because I didn't want to hurt his feelings.

42:31.428 --> 42:34.193
He was new in the field, and I thought, my God.

42:34.253 --> 42:36.196
But it was a unique catalog.

42:36.236 --> 42:45.613
After all, you've got to admit, a catalog devoted to John F. Kennedy with not one single authentic item in it is quite a feat.

42:45.874 --> 42:46.775
That's right.

42:46.795 --> 42:47.957
What does that have to, I'd imagine?

42:47.977 --> 42:49.540
And this has never been disclosed?

42:50.313 --> 42:51.375
Unless by me.

42:51.496 --> 43:00.076
I don't think I... No, it wouldn't have been by me because when I did my last book, Jenkins was still alive.

43:00.316 --> 43:03.544
I make it a policy never to write about living people.

43:03.564 --> 43:03.765
Okay.

43:03.825 --> 43:07.393
Now, did you say you'd tell me the name of the secretary?

43:08.167 --> 43:10.351
No, I didn't.

43:10.391 --> 43:12.394
What are you trying to do, put words in my mouth?

43:12.514 --> 43:13.195
Don't do that.

43:13.616 --> 43:14.377
Don't do that.

43:14.457 --> 43:15.118
No, I didn't do that.

43:15.138 --> 43:16.240
I put a question mark on the end of that.

43:16.260 --> 43:16.521
All right.

43:16.581 --> 43:17.462
I didn't say that.

43:17.883 --> 43:18.143
Okay.

43:18.183 --> 43:19.506
You should listen more carefully.

43:19.546 --> 43:21.769
No, I said, did you?

43:22.030 --> 43:22.130
Okay.

43:22.150 --> 43:23.733
No, I don't.

43:23.753 --> 43:24.634
But you don't.

43:24.654 --> 43:25.335
Let me ask you a question.

43:25.355 --> 43:26.477
Would you tell me who she is?

43:27.158 --> 43:29.462
No, I said I would ask if she would talk to you.

43:29.482 --> 43:30.604
Don't you remember that?

43:30.624 --> 43:31.105
Yes, sir.

43:31.125 --> 43:31.505
Okay.

43:31.525 --> 43:33.048
Play back your tape.

43:33.068 --> 43:33.649
Okay.

43:33.669 --> 43:33.769
Okay.

43:33.935 --> 44:03.064
One thing about me is you have to remember that I'm in court all the time and it's testifying as an expert witness in handwriting and I have to match what sparse brains I have against some of the greatest legal minds in the country because a lot of the cases that I'm involved in involve countless millions of dollars and therefore you have wonderful legal brains.

44:03.685 --> 44:20.817
and these legal brains under cross-examination really probe and push and twist and they try to try to establish that you don't know what you're talking about and that you contradict yourself and you have to be very careful and that's why

44:21.269 --> 44:24.172
When I tell you anything, I remember what it is anyway.

44:24.192 --> 44:24.733
That's good.

44:25.114 --> 44:26.335
And I'm not so slow.

44:26.495 --> 44:29.659
And I respect that.

44:29.819 --> 44:30.039
Okay.

44:30.380 --> 44:32.022
Now, let's go back to one other thing.

44:32.142 --> 44:39.951
And tell me when you want me to quit, by the way, because I've had you for close to an hour, and I don't want to overextend my welcome because I want to talk to you again.

44:39.991 --> 44:45.798
Well, what I would like you to do, if you will, is look at some of my books.

44:47.180 --> 44:49.162
Okay.

44:49.182 --> 44:50.584
Scribbers and Scowgles.

44:51.003 --> 44:54.006
Which I have, by the way.

44:54.026 --> 44:54.327
All right.

44:54.347 --> 44:57.711
And Great Forgers and Famous Fakes.

44:57.731 --> 44:58.812
Which I have.

44:59.012 --> 45:01.495
And Auction Madness, which you have, I think it.

45:01.515 --> 45:02.636
Right.

45:02.916 --> 45:07.241
And... Let's see.

45:07.261 --> 45:09.624
I'm trying to think of the ones that have cases here.

45:09.644 --> 45:13.548
And the final one, Collecting Autographs and Manuscripts.

45:13.568 --> 45:14.309
Right.

45:14.329 --> 45:17.573
I have that one, too.

45:17.593 --> 45:19.155
All right.

45:19.175 --> 45:20.436
Now, those books will give you...

45:20.855 --> 45:40.501
some of the more interesting cases that I've been involved in, although I've been involved in many, many cases since those were written, like the Mormon murders, and that I would be willing to talk to you about.

45:41.302 --> 45:42.964
I talked to

45:43.687 --> 45:51.680
a couple of the writers on the subject, and I furnished them with an entire carton, a big carton of papers.

45:51.841 --> 45:53.464
And I didn't even go over the papers.

45:53.524 --> 45:56.148
I told them to put down what they could find.

45:56.268 --> 46:00.295
I didn't care whether it was pro or con me.

46:00.680 --> 46:04.063
because I really don't have anything to hide.

46:04.083 --> 46:06.766
And I've just completed a book on the Hitler Diaries.

46:06.786 --> 46:09.368
That should be fascinating.

46:09.388 --> 46:13.452
Hugh Trevor Roper said it was spectacular, and you blew him out of the water, as I recall.

46:14.232 --> 46:18.396
If you like, I will let you look at the manuscript cover.

46:18.416 --> 46:20.698
It's going to be published by the University of Kentucky.

46:20.819 --> 46:21.279
Oh, really?

46:21.319 --> 46:22.600
Great.

46:23.101 --> 46:24.682
Maybe the next time we're down in New York.

46:24.902 --> 46:26.083
It's highly interesting.

46:26.244 --> 46:27.445
It really is.

46:27.585 --> 46:27.885
It's...

46:28.338 --> 46:33.687
It's the greatest forgery of all time, in its effect.

46:33.707 --> 46:34.408
In its effect?

46:34.528 --> 46:34.969
Yeah.

46:35.750 --> 46:38.474
You pretty readily determined that it was a phony, though.

46:38.494 --> 46:39.356
Instantly, yeah.

46:40.557 --> 46:44.163
By content as well as by... No, I never knew the content.

46:44.223 --> 46:51.234
I never knew anything about it, except that I was allowed to look at three pages, three zeroes pages.

46:51.254 --> 46:52.877
And right off the bat, you said phony.

46:53.583 --> 46:57.147
Instantly, and you'll see why if you look at my book.

46:57.167 --> 46:58.428
I can't wait to see it.

46:58.568 --> 46:59.189
It sounds fascinating.

46:59.209 --> 47:05.214
One final, give me another quote on that you were characterizing the type of person who gets this.

47:05.234 --> 47:09.118
You called it a pox or a malady or a virus, I think you called it.

47:09.138 --> 47:22.071
And I am interested, because you have observed some of these people and you've given testimony, what is it that gives a person this madness for paper or for books, for manuscripts?

47:22.473 --> 47:26.539
What is it that moves a person to want to possess these things?

47:26.559 --> 47:28.803
Do you have a sense of that, I wonder?

47:29.003 --> 47:33.750
Yeah, it gives you a feeling of power.

47:34.331 --> 47:45.108
Let me tell you what a Jewish collector said to me one time.

47:45.128 --> 47:51.197
First of all, a great many Jewish collectors are interested in Nazi autographs.

47:52.865 --> 47:54.607
I don't know whether you're Jewish or not.

47:54.627 --> 47:58.511
Greek, as a matter of fact.

47:58.531 --> 48:04.317
And they're especially interested in the villainous characters.

48:04.377 --> 48:05.318
It's a strange, isn't it?

48:05.338 --> 48:06.279
Yes.

48:06.319 --> 48:18.552
And I said to a Jewish collector one time, look, you're a...

48:18.987 --> 48:20.849
a Jew in every sense of the word.

48:20.889 --> 48:26.096
You go to synagogue and you practice all the rites and everything.

48:26.516 --> 48:39.452
How is it that you can tolerate owning a portrait of Henry with his handwriting on your wall?

48:40.674 --> 48:47.442
Doesn't that rub you the wrong way to have that human monster decorating your living room?

48:48.805 --> 49:01.456
And he said, it's like the hunted having the head of the hunter on his wall.

49:01.857 --> 49:04.604
And you know, you understand that.

49:04.644 --> 49:06.308
It's as though the deer

49:06.828 --> 49:16.198
could gore a man to death and then put the man's head and his empty rifle up on his walls.

49:16.218 --> 49:20.502
It is that feeling of power that it gives you.

49:20.522 --> 49:25.488
You have a power over these dead people.

49:25.508 --> 49:35.038
Whether it's a book, let's say it's a first edition of Adonias by Shelley.

49:35.058 --> 49:35.518
Okay.

49:36.410 --> 49:42.477
That book is worth today, $15,000.

49:42.577 --> 49:48.664
It's published, I believe, in my memories, right?

49:48.684 --> 50:04.122
That book, as you pick it up and read it, you are reading these great lines in a life like a dome of many colored glass stains of white radiance of eternity.

50:04.540 --> 50:08.704
And you're reading the lines as they were born.

50:08.744 --> 50:13.529
You're in on the birth of this great poem.

50:13.549 --> 50:17.874
And you're holding it in your hands, and you want it.

50:17.954 --> 50:18.214
That's yours.

50:18.234 --> 50:19.375
And it just gives you a thrill.

50:19.395 --> 50:20.396
It gives me a thrill.

50:20.416 --> 50:24.821
I can tell you, two weeks ago, I was out in Princeton, New Jersey, and I was with William Scheide.

50:24.841 --> 50:28.365
He's not writing, but at the Scheide Library, not if you know him.

50:28.385 --> 50:30.767
At least he's the only private owner of a Gutenberg Bible.

50:31.203 --> 50:36.850
It's on the campus of Princeton University, but it's three generations of the Scheide family.

50:36.870 --> 50:40.294
And that man went and he took out this, and it's original binding.

50:40.434 --> 50:42.196
Oh, my God.

50:42.336 --> 50:44.278
Are you sure of that?

50:44.298 --> 50:46.160
Oh, no, this is the C-H-E-I-E-E.

50:46.261 --> 50:47.062
Very famous.

50:47.462 --> 50:54.670
In fact, the Glowier Club just had a major exhibit of this stuff, 125 years in the Scheide Library, which is where I met him when they went out there.

50:54.690 --> 50:56.873
But I mean, the man let me hold this Bible.

50:57.545 --> 51:01.129
Are you strong enough?

51:01.149 --> 51:02.531
I almost felt like fainting.

51:02.551 --> 51:04.073
I mean, I was light-headed, you know.

51:04.093 --> 51:06.656
I was feeling the hold in the first puff.

51:06.716 --> 51:07.997
It was imprinted.

51:08.117 --> 51:11.041
And it was a dizzying sensation.

51:11.061 --> 51:11.341
It really was.

51:11.361 --> 51:13.724
It's what you just described, you know.

51:13.744 --> 51:14.785
And it's quite amazing.

51:14.805 --> 51:15.466
How about yourself?

51:15.486 --> 51:16.988
Do you collect things?

51:17.008 --> 51:17.929
Do you get the bug?

51:18.009 --> 51:22.354
Well, I used to be a collector.

51:22.374 --> 51:25.118
But I can't afford it anymore.

51:25.158 --> 51:27.180
But I know exactly how it feels.

51:27.768 --> 51:34.899
It's an incomparable field.

51:34.919 --> 51:40.307
As Rosenbach said, it's the second most exhilarating of all sports.

51:40.327 --> 51:43.432
And there are a lot of people who would put it first.

51:43.452 --> 51:47.738
You know Carlton Lake down in Texas?

51:47.859 --> 51:49.501
You ever heard of him?

51:49.521 --> 51:50.983
He's got a new book coming out from New Directions.

51:51.003 --> 51:52.606
He put together that French collection down there.

51:52.626 --> 51:54.028
He's from up here in Boston right back there.

51:54.430 --> 51:59.875
He struck a deal with Harry Rance to get a job down there.

52:00.035 --> 52:01.917
They're actually his curator in that collection.

52:01.937 --> 52:07.002
He uses that exact same quote, and he said, but most of us would reverse the order.

52:07.022 --> 52:07.882
It's not the same.

52:08.103 --> 52:10.305
A lot of people have.

52:10.425 --> 52:18.552
I got a letter from a guy a couple of years ago who said that he found my books more exhilarating than sex.

52:18.652 --> 52:19.974
That was very nice.

52:20.074 --> 52:21.535
Well, that's quite a compliment, isn't it?

52:22.088 --> 52:26.333
Yeah, so I'm really looking forward to the Cardinio book, by the way.

52:26.353 --> 52:34.481
I thought the job you did on that Shakespeare book was really, pardon my Greek, but it took some balls to write that.

52:34.501 --> 52:37.384
Yeah, and it takes even more to do the Cardinio.

52:37.525 --> 52:45.253
That is something that, despite the fact that it's in, well, it's in the same handwriting as the guy who wrote the will.

52:45.433 --> 52:47.235
And there's no question about that in your mind.

52:47.553 --> 52:48.274
None at all.

52:48.354 --> 52:50.377
Not any.

52:50.818 --> 52:54.143
Because you're going back now.

52:54.163 --> 52:55.706
The reason I say that is you're going back 400 years, you know.

52:55.726 --> 53:01.355
Yeah, but I'm dealing with a subject that I know, and that is handwriting.

53:01.375 --> 53:05.261
And that is constant through the ages.

53:05.281 --> 53:05.601
Is that correct?

53:05.621 --> 53:05.942
Yes, yes, it is.

53:05.962 --> 53:12.953
Of course, Shakespeare had many different handwriting, but that's not a very important factor.

53:13.861 --> 53:23.134
What I was impressed by is that, on the one hand, they say there were only six examples of his handwritten, and then Mr. Thomas Moore gave me the six.

53:23.214 --> 53:24.876
You say there are so many.

53:25.337 --> 53:26.558
Oh, there are dozens.

53:26.579 --> 53:30.304
They just haven't had the courage to authenticate them where the state is.

53:30.324 --> 53:42.180
Well, they insist that the will was written by Francis Collins or by his secretary or Emanuelsis, but the facts show otherwise.

53:43.257 --> 53:46.702
I think that's a fascinating piece.

53:46.882 --> 53:47.523
Okay.

53:47.744 --> 53:51.369
Well, I've bothered you from Florida now.

53:51.389 --> 53:53.753
Unless you want to tap on, I'll let you go.

53:53.773 --> 53:55.295
I know your time is valuable.

53:55.315 --> 53:56.617
Can I call you back, sir?

53:56.637 --> 53:59.061
You're worried you're going to run out of tape.

53:59.081 --> 54:00.463
No, I'm just looking.

54:00.483 --> 54:01.304
You know, you're amazing.

54:01.324 --> 54:01.805
I'm looking at it.

54:01.825 --> 54:03.287
It's ready to run out on the side.

54:03.487 --> 54:08.274
I'm going to switch it over in the other minute and second.

54:08.635 --> 54:11.980
No, I'd love to keep talking.

54:12.000 --> 54:12.100
Yeah.

54:14.408 --> 54:36.394
I don't think she will let you, but she might.

54:36.414 --> 54:38.577
Oh, no, I don't know that she...
