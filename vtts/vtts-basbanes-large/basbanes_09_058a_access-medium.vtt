WEBVTT

00:02.360 --> 00:05.904
So my name is .

00:06.325 --> 00:06.485
Wow.

00:06.906 --> 00:08.207
Yeah.

00:09.008 --> 00:14.595
So often, you know, Americans, they call me Gardner.

00:14.615 --> 00:17.659
I don't know why they present any in there.

00:17.679 --> 00:23.145
Including your publicists, with people who are already here, too.

00:23.185 --> 00:24.166
I see.

00:24.186 --> 00:25.248
That's right.

00:25.348 --> 00:28.492
It's easier to say, I think, here in America.

00:28.572 --> 00:29.413
But it's .

00:29.573 --> 00:29.633
OK.

00:30.068 --> 00:33.153
So you're saying that you were here for three days, one, two, three, four?

00:33.633 --> 00:36.217
Yes, I was here eight years ago.

00:36.958 --> 00:39.963
Actually, it was the year when I published my first book.

00:40.563 --> 00:41.485
But you should have a drink.

00:42.426 --> 00:43.247
Well, what are you drinking?

00:43.327 --> 00:44.008
I'm having Scotch.

00:44.349 --> 00:47.634
Yes, Scotch with soda water, is that what it is?

00:47.654 --> 00:48.034
Mm-hmm, sure.

00:48.635 --> 00:48.816
Okay.

00:48.836 --> 00:49.857
Do you have a preference?

00:50.117 --> 00:50.798
Pardon?

00:50.818 --> 00:52.100
Well, just anything.

00:52.120 --> 00:52.461
Scotch.

00:52.581 --> 00:54.063
Not bourbon, but Scotch.

00:55.345 --> 00:55.626
Okay.

00:56.507 --> 00:57.308
Okay.

00:57.997 --> 01:06.104
Anyway, the publishing house, they are paying for our meetings.

01:06.144 --> 01:10.728
They were very eager, like I said, to remember today.

01:10.768 --> 01:20.917
The book is generating a tremendous amount of interest.

01:20.937 --> 01:22.818
Well, it has, so far, yes.

01:23.059 --> 01:27.042
I'm really astonished.

01:27.359 --> 01:51.578
myself about that fact really you know really because when I wrote the book I thought that this book I mean it was important for some very few people I thought that it would never become a really I told my wife that I had you know written several books before like four books eh well this is

01:52.132 --> 02:04.685
No, well, my first fiction book, I also have written textbooks for school, but my first fiction book is a collection of four stories.

02:05.186 --> 02:13.315
Then came two books for children, and then my real breakthrough in Scandinavia as a author.

02:13.755 --> 02:17.279
It was a book for young adults, called Young Adults.

02:17.539 --> 02:18.460
Young Adults, yes.

02:18.743 --> 02:26.334
And it was called, I think the English title would be either The Patient's Mystery, or you might say The Mystery of Cards.

02:27.135 --> 02:29.378
That game is the mystery of Cards.

02:29.759 --> 02:31.702
Cards, you know, playing cards, you know.

02:32.243 --> 02:34.526
I'm just helping myself when I come to stand with friends.

02:34.706 --> 02:35.948
That's right, that's right.

02:35.968 --> 02:43.238
You know, it's a book which is, in a way, built exactly as Edith O'Cards, with 53 chapters.

02:44.020 --> 02:47.805
And the most important character in the book is the Joker.

02:48.595 --> 02:59.693
which is, in this book, sort of a metaphor, symbol, for the outsider, the philosopher, asking questions, you know?

02:59.934 --> 03:02.298
So there is a similarity then?

03:02.879 --> 03:07.306
Yes, because the other book is also, you might say, a philosophical novel.

03:07.366 --> 03:09.349
Socratic kind of a novel, perhaps.

03:09.550 --> 03:12.615
In a way, but not a philosophy book, you know?

03:12.635 --> 03:13.716
But it asks questions.

03:13.756 --> 03:14.097
That's right.

03:14.363 --> 03:19.088
And then, you know, it gave me several prizes, you know?

03:19.548 --> 03:21.690
And in a way, I became a famous man in Norway.

03:22.331 --> 03:33.241
Then I told my wife that now I think it's important to write a book on philosophy for young people, to be understood by young people, you know?

03:34.022 --> 03:36.044
So, that's it.

03:36.504 --> 03:38.686
We will not make money on this book.

03:39.267 --> 03:40.368
It's just so important.

03:40.989 --> 03:42.430
Because you see the other books.

03:42.730 --> 03:44.792
It is on the surface.

03:45.853 --> 03:50.357
It's a book about a father and a son.

03:50.858 --> 03:56.763
They are traveling through Europe, from Norway, to Athens, you know, the capital of philosophy, in a way.

03:57.424 --> 04:08.094
And I imagine that when this boy comes home to Norway, he will, of course, go into a library and ask the librarian for a book on philosophy.

04:08.695 --> 04:12.298
However, the librarian would have to say, I'm sorry, you're too young.

04:12.734 --> 04:19.545
you know, but we have some books about dinosaurs, you know, or about astronomy, you know, but not philosophy.

04:19.966 --> 04:21.428
And that was a shame, I thought.

04:21.448 --> 04:23.552
And then I decided to try to write such a book.

04:23.892 --> 04:36.573
At first, I tried to write a few books, you know, and the first sentence I wrote was very silly, I remember I wrote, the human beings, they have always asked themselves existential questions.

04:37.094 --> 04:39.197
Oh, no, it's so boring.

04:39.481 --> 04:41.744
I was so much like a teacher, you know?

04:41.764 --> 04:45.067
You want to engage with a child, obviously.

04:45.267 --> 04:58.803
Well, yes, I wanted to try to write a philosophy book, not only for young people, but also for, you may say, for adult people above 13, 14 years old.

05:00.605 --> 05:01.786
That was my purpose.

05:01.806 --> 05:03.288
That was my plan.

05:03.308 --> 05:06.011
And I gave up, because the book was a boy.

05:06.992 --> 05:08.914
And then the plot,

05:09.248 --> 05:09.870
of a novel.

05:10.030 --> 05:16.646
I wrote about Sophie coming home from school, finding these notes, these letters.

05:17.167 --> 05:17.889
Who are you?

05:18.350 --> 05:19.834
Where does the world come from?

05:20.415 --> 05:23.803
And they think that these questions are accurate.

05:24.204 --> 05:25.427
And you can't.

05:26.009 --> 05:27.392
And then the story

05:27.912 --> 05:30.636
of a novel and also a philosophy that he started.

05:30.656 --> 05:32.358
And a novel within a novel almost.

05:32.519 --> 05:33.480
In a way, yes.

05:33.580 --> 05:36.464
So that was the beginning.

05:36.545 --> 05:39.969
I think you enjoyed playing games, though, too.

05:41.351 --> 05:41.872
That's art.

05:41.952 --> 05:44.556
I think I enjoyed intellectual puzzles, you know?

05:45.558 --> 05:55.051
So the other book, the first, you know, the other book called The Mystery of Cards is very, it has a very intricate, you say that?

05:55.232 --> 05:57.054
Intricate?

05:57.074 --> 05:57.615
Intricate?

05:57.950 --> 05:59.413
Intricate structure.

05:59.493 --> 06:00.414
Intricate structure.

06:01.075 --> 06:06.465
Very, you know, and so far.

06:06.565 --> 06:18.706
But my only purpose for Sophia's role was that I didn't have any artistic ambitions in this role, only pedagogical.

06:18.946 --> 06:23.434
At what point did you realize that you were writing

06:24.207 --> 06:34.118
something that would engage the intention of millions of people that would transcend the original scope in your mind.

06:34.178 --> 06:36.160
It took a long, long while.

06:36.641 --> 06:46.992
You know, I mean, did you finish it and then went out into the world and then you discovered that they... You didn't know it when you were finished.

06:47.213 --> 06:52.999
I wrote that later to my publishing house in Norway and I asked them,

06:53.485 --> 07:01.576
for publishing this book, even though, of course, it would not be a success economically.

07:01.596 --> 07:02.698
You know?

07:02.858 --> 07:03.840
So I was wrong.

07:03.980 --> 07:10.068
And even my publishing house did not at all expect this to happen.

07:10.088 --> 07:17.158
But it came out in Norway only three weeks before Christmas, you know, in 91.

07:17.819 --> 07:19.241
Oh, so this is about 91?

07:19.442 --> 07:20.123
In Norway, yes.

07:20.443 --> 07:20.803
In Norway.

07:20.824 --> 07:22.025
So this book is three years old?

07:22.165 --> 07:23.307
Yes, it is.

07:23.607 --> 07:31.838
I have written two other novels after this book, and only for this, you know, in Norway we are mostly selling books before Christmas.

07:32.800 --> 07:37.766
And in these three weeks the book came in a lot of editions, you know.

07:38.587 --> 07:44.215
Even then I thought this is a book in Norway for Norwegian, you know.

07:44.380 --> 07:47.525
It's now 29 countries.

07:47.545 --> 07:49.067
It's incredible.

07:49.147 --> 07:51.030
In Germany, I understand 350,000.

07:51.250 --> 07:53.734
No, no, no, it's much more.

07:53.754 --> 08:01.144
I talked to them two weeks ago, and then they said now it's more than half a million.

08:01.585 --> 08:03.367
They have sold in hardcover.

08:03.387 --> 08:04.068
In hardcover.

08:04.509 --> 08:07.914
And, you know, I couldn't understand it.

08:07.934 --> 08:10.538
I'm still astonished, you know.

08:11.119 --> 08:12.300
In your theory, I mean.

08:12.781 --> 08:13.442
Yes.

08:13.608 --> 08:15.870
I didn't when I wrote the book, but now I have.

08:16.591 --> 08:20.456
You know the magazine in John Nicole Der Spiegel?

08:20.816 --> 08:22.798
They have a bestseller list.

08:22.878 --> 08:24.340
You must be way up here.

08:24.880 --> 08:25.201
Number one.

08:25.221 --> 08:27.343
It has been number one for half a year.

08:28.124 --> 08:31.508
You know, it's a book for young adults.

08:32.028 --> 08:37.194
You know, you never find books for young adults on a list like that.

08:37.715 --> 08:40.878
And in her book, well, theory.

08:40.898 --> 08:42.720
I have one very tricky

08:42.970 --> 09:08.893
theory and that is fine you know that very many people they have some feeling that philosophy is something interesting and important but too difficult without even understanding perhaps what philosophy is when you ask the question where do we come from what's beyond the stars when my daughter says to me are there other sons like you know this is all

09:09.785 --> 09:13.428
They're asking existential philosophical questions.

09:13.448 --> 09:14.289
They really do.

09:14.409 --> 09:24.899
And I remember when I was a kid, you know, I was asking very much the same questions as the philosophers asked.

09:24.919 --> 09:29.323
Like, I remember, for instance, you know, I was running to the bus.

09:29.343 --> 09:29.583
Running.

09:29.843 --> 09:30.704
Running.

09:30.724 --> 09:33.767
And then my feet were, you know, running.

09:33.787 --> 09:36.990
My mind was thinking of something completely different, you know.

09:37.223 --> 09:37.764
other things.

09:38.204 --> 09:44.232
Then I asked myself, how could my students understand how to run?

09:44.252 --> 09:45.955
How to move?

09:45.975 --> 09:51.242
And in a way, I then asked the same question as Descartes.

09:51.702 --> 09:53.164
You know, the French philosopher.

09:53.805 --> 09:54.446
Descartes.

09:54.466 --> 09:55.327
Descartes, yes.

09:55.808 --> 10:06.522
And I remember that I asked my mother and father, we have a cottage cabin in the mountains, where the animals are, the cows, you know,

10:06.788 --> 10:14.317
Then I ask my mother, mom, mom, mom, why does the car always get a car?

10:15.459 --> 10:17.401
You know, another sort of animal.

10:18.002 --> 10:22.147
Well, I ask the same question as Plato then, you know, like that.

10:22.167 --> 10:24.250
So, so, so my, I think Plato.

10:24.650 --> 10:26.172
Plato, Plato, I'm sorry.

10:26.192 --> 10:29.136
I'm just saying this for my, I'm sorry for my pronunciation.

10:29.156 --> 10:30.457
You don't mind my, you don't mind my.

10:30.758 --> 10:30.998
Look at all.

10:31.499 --> 10:31.699
No.

10:32.033 --> 10:34.999
Because you can have a lot of interviews in this country.

10:35.019 --> 10:35.841
That's right.

10:35.861 --> 10:37.183
It's very hard for me to learn.

10:37.704 --> 10:39.268
You said quite a little.

10:39.348 --> 10:40.069
Very good, yes.

10:40.851 --> 10:52.995
You know, but that was a very easy theory, because I think that in Scandinavia people, a lot of people, they understand, to a certain extent, the meaning of the word philosophy.

10:53.397 --> 10:54.799
But it's too difficult.

10:54.819 --> 10:56.782
Only for professors.

10:56.802 --> 10:57.803
See, I'm Greek.

10:57.823 --> 10:58.624
I'm American.

10:58.644 --> 10:58.904
Really?

10:58.984 --> 11:00.206
But my background is Greek.

11:00.326 --> 11:00.747
I see.

11:00.987 --> 11:03.250
And then you understand, of course, the word, you know.

11:03.270 --> 11:07.796
So philosophy is... All Greeks are philosophers, I think.

11:07.816 --> 11:09.358
Yes, I think.

11:09.378 --> 11:11.742
That is true that I am in Greece.

11:11.922 --> 11:16.788
You know, I even knew people, they have names like Aristotle.

11:16.868 --> 11:18.711
I have a cousin named Aristotle.

11:18.731 --> 11:18.831
Yeah.

11:18.963 --> 11:20.905
And we have another cousin named Saka.

11:21.025 --> 11:22.347
We call him Saka.

11:22.367 --> 11:22.968
That's right.

11:23.028 --> 11:25.350
There's another one called Plato.

11:25.751 --> 11:26.552
That's right.

11:26.572 --> 11:28.634
And these are revered names.

11:29.415 --> 11:31.117
That's right.

11:31.918 --> 11:34.801
What better name for a child than Saka?

11:34.861 --> 11:36.002
That's right.

11:36.023 --> 11:48.717
I feel that the Greek people, I am actually quite often in Greece, because I have in the summertime a course for Norwegian teachers,

11:48.832 --> 11:50.534
at the island Lesbos.

11:51.835 --> 11:52.376
Lesbos?

11:52.436 --> 11:53.457
Lesbos, yes.

11:53.577 --> 11:54.198
Wonderful.

11:54.778 --> 11:54.959
Yes.

11:54.979 --> 11:56.520
In a town called Kaloni.

11:56.981 --> 12:02.787
We live in a monastery, and there are the people from where we are, and I teach them philosophy.

12:02.807 --> 12:04.990
Me and some colleagues, you know.

12:05.911 --> 12:16.442
So that was the easy theory, but then there is another theory, and that is that, you know, when I grew up, I mean, I mean that all people

12:16.692 --> 12:25.706
All societies, I mean, I'm sorry, need a marketplace, a place where we can meet and where we can discuss thoughts.

12:26.787 --> 12:37.924
And when I grew up in Oslo, Norway, we had in the 50s a central marketplace where people really met and talked.

12:38.410 --> 13:04.907
the greeks are exactly and you know what i'm talking about is the greeks word agora that's right that's precisely where they did this stuff yes they would go inside they did you know under appropriately you have the old agora

13:05.191 --> 13:08.136
Today it's more the placa.

13:08.897 --> 13:12.904
That's exactly where the placa is.

13:13.224 --> 13:15.488
I've walked through it.

13:15.508 --> 13:20.316
I always feel the stimulating lanes, you know.

13:20.536 --> 13:25.163
And I think that all healthy society needs such a meeting place.

13:25.504 --> 13:27.888
But then came the modern society, you know.

13:27.928 --> 13:31.654
I moved to a suburb.

13:31.972 --> 13:34.235
We had lost this common marketplace.

13:34.476 --> 13:38.341
However, now we've got the television, but only terrible.

13:38.441 --> 13:43.108
Well, but it was only one channel, you know, for a long, long, long time in Norway.

13:43.549 --> 13:47.795
And then the television was a meeting place, a common marketplace.

13:49.057 --> 13:54.084
Now we have got all these different cable televisions, you know, all the channels.

13:55.025 --> 13:57.709
So we can choose, in a way, that

13:58.162 --> 14:01.467
and lost the common marketplace.

14:01.647 --> 14:08.118
Well, I think that maybe people now, they feel that it's important to have a common marketplace in the history.

14:09.059 --> 14:19.275
I understand that one of the motivating factors for you to persuade you to write this book was this plethora of new age

14:19.525 --> 14:23.650
philosophy, which outrages me, I have to say.

14:23.670 --> 14:25.471
And you might talk a little bit about that.

14:25.492 --> 14:32.059
I mean, what do you see out there separating this nonsense of pop philosophy?

14:32.079 --> 14:34.541
Well, I have a skeptical mind.

14:34.762 --> 14:48.857
Well, I think that, you know, for 20 years now, in Norway, and I think in America too, when you went into a great bookstore,

14:49.225 --> 14:55.317
There were huge helps under the title alternative philosophy, or new age, you know.

14:55.878 --> 14:57.622
Then I thought, so, that's life.

14:58.363 --> 15:00.367
So great affection for alternative philosophy.

15:00.568 --> 15:01.930
So where is the real philosophy?

15:02.191 --> 15:04.275
It must be an even greater department, you know.

15:04.776 --> 15:06.459
So they didn't find it.

15:06.479 --> 15:08.263
If there is a one, there has to be a two.

15:08.463 --> 15:10.666
You don't have a two unless there's a one.

15:10.866 --> 15:11.347
Exactly.

15:11.868 --> 15:13.690
Or a B or an A. I mean, that's right.

15:13.711 --> 15:16.074
But all they have is a two without having a one.

15:16.254 --> 15:17.796
That's right.

15:18.077 --> 15:18.698
That's right.

15:18.938 --> 15:19.939
No, I agree.

15:20.320 --> 15:26.949
I mean, back before, we used all this alternative stuff.

15:27.190 --> 15:35.702
It would be important to know the real philosophical and critical traditions from back to the light of soul process.

15:35.902 --> 15:44.653
Did you sense from your students that there was a backing off in philosophy, that there was a need for books such as the one that you intended to write?

15:44.673 --> 16:00.814
Yes, because really, and I think there's something new in Europe, because, you know, it's really new, because in the 70s, when I started to study it, in a way, we were hiding behind the ideologies, you know?

16:00.834 --> 16:03.377
Very many students in Norway, they said they were Marxists.

16:04.268 --> 16:06.910
If not, you were not a Marxist, you know?

16:07.171 --> 16:08.672
Are you still Marxist, by the way?

16:08.752 --> 16:08.932
No.

16:09.593 --> 16:09.773
No.

16:10.473 --> 16:11.975
But we were fighting.

16:12.035 --> 16:13.917
We have basketball.

16:13.937 --> 16:16.579
We insist on continuing to be a Marxist.

16:16.599 --> 16:17.420
But anyway, I'm sorry.

16:17.440 --> 16:20.803
No, no, I... I'm curious if it's still involved.

16:20.823 --> 16:21.743
No, no, no, not at all.

16:21.824 --> 16:25.086
It's really... I mean, we have finished with Marxism.

16:25.106 --> 16:29.230
And in a way, we have finished with ideologists in general.

16:29.630 --> 16:32.393
So today, we are not hiding behind the answers.

16:32.433 --> 16:33.634
We are asking the questions.

16:34.070 --> 16:53.682
you know and i remember i myself was really uh active in the student politics you know also a little left wing you know and yeah i was and but i remember i took part in the vietnam demonstrations you know you were just a kid yes i'm very young

16:54.100 --> 16:57.684
I was part of, I was in the service during that year.

16:57.804 --> 16:58.164
I see.

16:58.464 --> 16:59.986
You were in Vietnam?

17:00.146 --> 17:02.368
Yeah, I was a naval officer.

17:02.428 --> 17:03.149
Really, really?

17:03.209 --> 17:05.051
Oh, that's interesting.

17:05.171 --> 17:07.193
I'm a little older than you are.

17:07.433 --> 17:08.374
Yes, you know.

17:09.235 --> 17:11.337
But the 60s was my decade.

17:11.418 --> 17:12.839
Exactly, from me to the 70s.

17:12.879 --> 17:18.825
You know, so, but then I think I had some sort of a secret voice.

17:19.548 --> 17:21.632
I did something a little dirty, you know.

17:21.992 --> 17:23.375
I couldn't tell my friends.

17:23.816 --> 17:25.298
They would be very angry with me.

17:25.318 --> 17:31.249
But I sometimes left the Vietnam demonstrations, you know, after it was finished, you know.

17:31.269 --> 17:32.771
And I did this dirty thing.

17:33.112 --> 17:33.953
I went in the opera.

17:33.974 --> 17:36.959
You know, that was forbidden.

17:37.259 --> 17:41.607
It was too, what do you say, bourgeoisie?

17:42.464 --> 17:52.036
But I went there and we listened to Bertini and Verdi, you know.

17:52.076 --> 17:52.817
What is opera?

17:52.977 --> 17:58.083
In a way, it's a synthesis of love and tuberculosis.

17:59.485 --> 18:04.932
But in a way, the opera told me about life.

18:05.693 --> 18:06.754
You know, because what is life?

18:07.015 --> 18:09.838
We meet each other, but maybe we get in love.

18:10.207 --> 18:14.411
We walked together for a while, and then we got taken away from each other again.

18:15.252 --> 18:19.016
That's what the Oprah is about, and this dimension.

18:19.036 --> 18:21.599
I didn't find that in the student revolution.

18:21.619 --> 18:24.662
I would like to know at what point this became a novel.

18:25.103 --> 18:26.925
It became a work of art, which is nice.

18:27.125 --> 18:28.626
It became a creative work.

18:28.947 --> 18:36.875
It didn't just become a textbook to explain difficult philosophic concepts for the kids.

18:36.895 --> 18:37.716
It became...

18:38.371 --> 18:43.198
a work of art that embodied all of these kinds of things, and it used it to advance a plot.

18:43.859 --> 18:45.722
And I did it for the meaning of a way.

18:45.742 --> 18:47.224
When did that start to happen?

18:47.264 --> 18:50.549
I wrote and then the process, the creative process.

18:50.609 --> 18:57.039
You know, I decided to write the book on the paper, and I wrote 60 Patriots, and I threw it away.

18:57.079 --> 19:02.607
It was too much like being a professor behind the chair.

19:03.228 --> 19:15.887
I gave it up and it was put in the cell away for some months.

19:17.048 --> 19:19.933
And then I just had this picture, mental picture.

19:20.433 --> 19:21.775
Oh, Sophie.

19:21.916 --> 19:23.398
Coming home from school.

19:24.339 --> 19:24.840
Yes, in a way.

19:24.860 --> 19:26.983
You have a mental picture of her.

19:27.003 --> 19:28.606
Yes, I did.

19:28.626 --> 19:29.607
Coming home from school.

19:30.582 --> 19:31.824
Tell me about the rabbit.

19:31.844 --> 19:34.869
Is this an American jacket or is it the same jacket?

19:34.889 --> 19:40.798
No, it's not only American, but I think real American.

19:41.159 --> 19:46.988
I've seen about ten different jackets of the book, you know, so far.

19:47.008 --> 19:47.949
And that is the American.

19:48.070 --> 19:48.891
Do they amuse you?

19:49.772 --> 19:52.116
Yes, it's very amusing to see the different jackets.

19:52.136 --> 19:54.480
Because it is the reading of the book.

19:54.500 --> 19:54.660
Yes.

19:54.680 --> 19:55.982
It is some artist's...

19:56.570 --> 20:18.460
I think in the beginning of the book there is this allegory of the rabbit and the human being born at the you know

20:18.659 --> 20:23.584
I thought there might be an Alice in Wonderland kind of movie.

20:23.624 --> 20:31.973
Well, perhaps, too, but I'm using this rabbit like the magician, part of the top hat, you know?

20:32.173 --> 20:43.846
And in a way, we are, the world is this rabbit taken up from the top hat of the universe, you know, from nothing.

20:43.926 --> 20:45.848
The world is created in a way, you know?

20:46.638 --> 20:51.766
So that's, I think, why they're here and only here in America.

20:52.607 --> 21:14.721
Because, for instance, in Norway and in Denmark, they have made other jackets with columns and acropolis, and with Albertullus, this man in the book, and Sophie, and the dog, and, you know,

21:14.870 --> 21:31.761
When you say when you have a mental image or so, when you think of Marx, you think of yourself, and you... Well, you know, I often meet young people in Norway, and they often use the arguments for nothing.

21:32.182 --> 21:36.810
You know, did you want to... Yes, you know, I have...

21:37.111 --> 21:45.441
I was asking about an image of Sophie.

21:45.541 --> 21:48.104
There are a couple parts to this question.

21:48.765 --> 21:53.350
This individual, this malleable young teenager, had to be a girl.

21:56.013 --> 21:56.694
Couldn't be a boy.

21:56.734 --> 21:58.016
For two reasons.

21:58.036 --> 22:04.063
First of all, the concept, Sophia,

22:04.482 --> 22:25.225
you know the greek word wisdom the concept of wisdom sophia is in the european tradition is female you know it's an old tradition and also in greek mythology

22:25.357 --> 22:30.803
She is the goddess of wisdom, you know, with this old, old, you know.

22:31.203 --> 22:32.985
She is born fully grown.

22:33.286 --> 22:33.966
That's right.

22:34.347 --> 22:37.030
But I mean, the concept of Sophia.

22:37.270 --> 22:38.291
That's right.

22:38.311 --> 22:43.697
And the concept of Sophia is also in the Orthodox Church, you know, the Greek Orthodox Church.

22:43.717 --> 22:44.037
I know.

22:44.958 --> 22:53.187
So it's an old tradition that God is male, but God also has a female part, person.

22:53.825 --> 22:55.547
which is the Holy Sophia.

22:55.567 --> 23:05.477
You know, in Constantinople, in Istanbul, there is this old church called Hagia Hagia Sophia, which means the Holy Sophia, you know.

23:06.458 --> 23:07.939
So it has to be, I think, a girl.

23:08.059 --> 23:16.328
Even Socrates, when he is being asked, who gave you your wisdom, he is saying it was Biotima, a woman.

23:17.809 --> 23:23.815
So, and also in general, not always, but very, very much in general, I think that

23:24.166 --> 23:53.312
women and girls are in a way a little more curious to understand things than men for women it's very often important to try to understand some things while it's for men often more important to be understood the other way not always but you can recognize it in the restaurant you see that a man and a wife they are sitting talking together

23:53.613 --> 23:57.939
She's really listening to him, trying to understand, you know, often, not always.

23:58.380 --> 24:00.323
And he is trying to be understood.

24:01.725 --> 24:13.142
And philosophy is really about trying to understand something, to be curious, you know, to, you know, so process.

24:13.162 --> 24:18.169
He said that I know only thing, only one thing that I don't know.

24:19.111 --> 24:24.118
And then he became a philosopher because he wanted to know more.

24:24.819 --> 24:31.748
When did you realize that you were a philosopher?

24:31.768 --> 24:41.402
You know, the real source of this book, for instance, is my general experience of life.

24:41.462 --> 24:45.928
I mean, when I wake up in the morning, I think it's changed that I live.

24:46.212 --> 24:48.154
But I, you know, who am I?

24:48.815 --> 24:50.918
What is the world?

24:50.938 --> 24:54.141
And also I know that I am here just for a short while.

24:54.962 --> 24:55.743
Very short.

24:55.763 --> 24:55.983
Very short.

24:56.384 --> 24:57.886
And then I will go.

24:58.506 --> 25:01.570
And I will never, ever come together.

25:01.590 --> 25:03.512
That is my general feeling.

25:03.532 --> 25:14.205
You know, very often in Norway, people are, young people, very interested in the strange stories about info.

25:14.225 --> 25:14.525
You know, info.

25:14.545 --> 25:14.786
Why?

25:15.867 --> 25:16.067
I, I,

25:16.452 --> 25:19.535
I mean, in a way, they are crossing the water to get water.

25:20.076 --> 25:24.320
Because there is not any miracle greater than the world.

25:25.621 --> 25:30.587
So, I saw a movie called Close Encounter of the Third Kind.

25:31.067 --> 25:33.109
Yes, did you write that?

25:33.229 --> 25:33.730
Yes, I did.

25:33.970 --> 25:40.016
But, you know, I think behind this title is lying this way of thinking.

25:40.197 --> 25:43.540
Close Encounter of the First Kind is when you see the UFO.

25:43.958 --> 25:52.426
Oh, the second kind is when you even see these creatures, these, you know, human-like bodies in the UFO.

25:53.107 --> 26:01.895
Then you have a close encounter of the third kind, when you can even touch them, these aliens, the strangers, you know?

26:02.015 --> 26:02.636
Okay?

26:02.656 --> 26:12.345
But I have experienced a close encounter of the fourth kind, because I am his success-based man.

26:12.545 --> 26:27.763
I mean, I will say that I have experienced a close encounter of the first time, because I am this peculiar spaceman.

26:27.783 --> 26:31.187
I am this alien, this stranger.

26:31.688 --> 26:36.193
And I go to the mirror in the morning, I watch my face, and I think, who are you?

26:37.375 --> 26:40.999
Is there any hope for a guy like you?

26:41.485 --> 26:48.774
So you do this every morning if you could ever... My wife is asking me exactly that question.

26:49.154 --> 26:50.155
You are lying to me.

26:50.496 --> 26:51.677
You don't every morning.

26:51.757 --> 26:53.940
And of course she is right.

26:53.960 --> 26:55.101
Often.

26:55.121 --> 26:55.742
Very often.

26:57.164 --> 27:03.551
And maybe I thought for a while that I was a little like an outsider.

27:04.913 --> 27:09.298
But I think that very many people, they feel it this way.

27:10.426 --> 27:12.449
Who am I?

27:12.909 --> 27:13.670
Where do I come from?

27:14.071 --> 27:15.012
What is the universe?

27:15.954 --> 27:20.500
So those are the two questions that have to begin this book, aren't they then?

27:20.820 --> 27:21.802
And then?

27:21.822 --> 27:22.583
Yes, sir.

27:22.643 --> 27:24.025
They're the most fundamental.

27:24.045 --> 27:31.455
In a way, I think for me, all philosophical questions, very late, can you say that?

27:31.475 --> 27:31.675
Say again?

27:31.775 --> 27:32.396
Very late.

27:32.616 --> 27:35.320
No, they are coming out of me.

27:35.641 --> 27:36.602
Derived from?

27:36.842 --> 27:37.463
Derived from?

27:37.679 --> 27:39.321
This is the same question.

27:39.341 --> 27:40.362
What is the world?

27:40.963 --> 27:43.045
What is the universe?

27:43.065 --> 27:44.287
Where does the universe come from?

27:44.928 --> 27:53.438
That is, for me, the most fundamental philosophical question.

27:53.458 --> 27:55.640
I'm sorry for talking so far.

27:55.660 --> 27:57.222
No, I love you.

27:57.242 --> 27:58.864
It will be because I'm a pirate.

27:58.884 --> 27:59.965
I've been traveling all the day.

28:00.005 --> 28:01.708
I will slow you down when I do it.

28:01.868 --> 28:03.349
Very good.

28:03.970 --> 28:06.353
I have to transcribe it.

28:06.788 --> 28:12.439
Everything you're saying is important to me.

28:12.459 --> 28:15.505
And you don't mind if I jump around with the questions either.

28:15.705 --> 28:19.112
We'll go all over the place.

28:19.152 --> 28:19.373
Yes.

28:19.393 --> 28:20.655
You'll jump together.

28:20.675 --> 28:23.381
And I do it very well.

28:24.162 --> 28:26.687
How has this book changed your life?

28:26.988 --> 28:33.879
And I don't just mean clearly the financial success that undoubtedly has come with.

28:34.100 --> 28:36.464
It's kind of irrelevant, I guess.

28:36.484 --> 28:37.906
Well, for me it is.

28:37.926 --> 28:47.542
The only thing of luxury I will buy is, what do you call it in English?

28:47.562 --> 28:51.088
I know they are making it now in Germany.

28:51.862 --> 28:55.087
It's a very old instrument where they play, you know, melodies.

28:55.607 --> 28:56.208
What do you call it?

28:56.829 --> 28:57.330
In a seat.

28:57.991 --> 28:59.693
Oh, an organ or some kind?

28:59.713 --> 29:00.434
Yes, it is organ.

29:00.514 --> 29:01.836
A hand organ.

29:02.036 --> 29:05.822
Where you have the melodies on some sort of thing, you know, like that.

29:08.085 --> 29:10.568
That's the only thing, it's very funny.

29:10.708 --> 29:12.150
It cost about $10,000.

29:12.170 --> 29:14.333
$10,000.

29:14.354 --> 29:15.295
$10,000?

29:15.335 --> 29:16.997
$10,000.

29:17.338 --> 29:18.019
$10,000.

29:18.039 --> 29:21.143
Anyway, this was just for fun.

29:21.595 --> 29:29.684
No, it has changed my life, really, because I am, in a way, not a free person anymore.

29:29.704 --> 29:35.211
Because I am being, you know, now I used to be a teacher.

29:35.972 --> 29:36.592
Now I'm not.

29:37.233 --> 29:41.298
But when I was a teacher, I had more time to write than I do now.

29:42.860 --> 29:45.262
It'll settle down a while.

29:45.282 --> 29:45.763
I hope so.

29:46.250 --> 29:51.779
I'm hopeful that that book that you mentioned earlier, the one about the card, is published here.

29:52.139 --> 29:53.281
I really hope so, too.

29:53.341 --> 29:54.984
I think it probably depends upon the success of this book.

29:55.064 --> 29:58.249
Maybe, but in a way... Do you have any apprehension?

29:58.269 --> 29:58.870
I'm sorry, finish with it.

29:59.050 --> 30:00.572
Pardon, what do you mean apprehension?

30:00.693 --> 30:03.237
About how this book might be received?

30:03.697 --> 30:09.486
Yes, well, I... Why don't you finish with it earlier, in a way, you were saying.

30:10.628 --> 30:12.291
Yes, about the other book.

30:12.411 --> 30:13.793
I think...

30:14.650 --> 30:21.542
In a way, for me, personally, you know, it's perhaps even more important than this one.

30:22.103 --> 30:35.306
I think it's... I really, myself, I really consider it, but I know this biblical, the material part.

30:35.326 --> 30:39.814
You probably don't realize it, because you are a philosopher, you are a scholar.

30:39.997 --> 30:45.082
We have preoccupied with these questions of resistance and what.

30:45.482 --> 30:49.005
I mean, the central question is what and why.

30:49.065 --> 30:52.709
But you're a storyteller.

30:53.490 --> 30:55.111
Yes, that's what I am.

30:55.892 --> 30:56.613
You're a storyteller.

30:56.633 --> 30:59.395
In a way, and that is what I'm doing all about.

30:59.695 --> 31:07.843
Did you know that you had the power to encamp and to engage the readers?

31:08.161 --> 31:33.561
Yes, in a way, I saw an article in the Norwegian newspaper saying that I think 60% of all kids could use the computer, but only 8% could boil an egg.

31:33.760 --> 31:35.802
I'll read a book, for that matter.

31:35.822 --> 31:36.923
Or boil an egg.

31:37.043 --> 31:37.864
Or boil an egg.

31:38.044 --> 31:44.151
But for children, my kids, who are two daughters, they are really important to do this.

31:44.171 --> 31:45.071
They teach me things.

31:45.091 --> 31:47.314
Yeah, that's right.

31:47.334 --> 31:47.494
Exactly.

31:47.614 --> 31:51.898
But do you think that people are reading so much?

31:52.539 --> 31:56.223
My kids do read books, because they're brought up in a culture of belief.

31:56.783 --> 31:58.485
My house is a house of books.

31:58.921 --> 32:02.791
The book I wrote is a tribute to books.

32:02.972 --> 32:05.198
My book is coming out next year, by the way.

32:05.759 --> 32:05.960
Really?

32:05.980 --> 32:08.226
It's called Bibriomania, Book Madness.

32:08.246 --> 32:09.189
Oh, that's a good thing.

32:09.249 --> 32:09.750
Yes, really.

32:09.770 --> 32:12.478
I'll send you a copy in Norway if you'd like.

32:12.498 --> 32:14.483
Can you give me an address before we leave tonight?

32:14.463 --> 32:23.011
Do that people then I you know of course the people who really listen to me now in Norway in this little country, you know And I can take it to my publisher or whatever.

32:23.071 --> 32:24.773
Yeah Yeah, I'd like you to read it again.

32:24.813 --> 32:28.296
Yeah, that's gonna be a big book six hundred and fifteen pages.

32:28.496 --> 32:40.448
Oh really interesting and it starts in Alexandria where they tried to gather all the world's knowledge under one roof and that it was a fire They actually tried to send out and get all the books.

32:40.468 --> 32:40.808
Yeah

32:40.788 --> 32:41.950
and bring them together here.

32:42.271 --> 32:42.732
That's right.

32:42.752 --> 32:43.253
And you know what?

32:43.293 --> 32:45.477
They came very close to doing it.

32:45.497 --> 32:48.142
Look at the people who worked at Ellison.

32:48.162 --> 32:48.482
That's right.

32:48.503 --> 32:49.164
It was unbelievable.

32:49.264 --> 32:51.668
Anyway, I don't want to talk about my book.

32:51.869 --> 32:54.053
And that is from where we got the word museum.

32:55.556 --> 32:56.578
Muses.

32:56.678 --> 32:58.361
It was a museum.

32:58.401 --> 32:59.824
The word museum comes from muses.

33:00.665 --> 33:01.166
I know.

33:01.246 --> 33:03.150
They gave...

33:03.552 --> 33:09.682
tribute that honored the muses, which inspired their native instincts.

33:09.702 --> 33:10.063
That's right.

33:10.083 --> 33:13.449
That's where the word museum comes from.

33:13.849 --> 33:14.731
That's right.

33:15.212 --> 33:16.574
Have you ever been to Delphi?

33:17.315 --> 33:17.556
Delphi.

33:17.836 --> 33:18.157
Delphi.

33:18.497 --> 33:20.140
Yes, I have.

33:20.220 --> 33:21.342
I've been to Pergamum.

33:21.895 --> 33:28.882
There was a wonderful library there, which is a rival library in Alexandria.

33:29.302 --> 33:32.545
I'm very interested about this book.

33:32.946 --> 33:35.328
What did you say?

33:35.548 --> 33:36.269
Bibliomania?

33:36.469 --> 33:42.015
It means the mania for books.

33:44.337 --> 33:49.422
But in the process, the people who are passionate about books,

33:49.874 --> 33:51.176
They preserve ideas.

33:51.216 --> 33:52.158
They save things.

33:52.338 --> 33:54.221
They just figure it's books.

33:54.241 --> 33:56.825
There is a misconception that once it's in a book, it's saved.

33:56.926 --> 33:57.807
It's not.

33:57.987 --> 33:59.229
Books are destroyed.

33:59.249 --> 33:59.991
Books are burned.

34:00.431 --> 34:02.074
Books are thrown away.

34:03.356 --> 34:05.740
You know Beowulf.

34:05.990 --> 34:06.851
Yes, yes, yes.

34:06.871 --> 34:10.055
Well, that would not exist today if it weren't for a book collector.

34:10.255 --> 34:12.858
Robert Cotton saved the only known copy.

34:13.038 --> 34:16.201
When they destroyed the English monasteries, he got a copy.

34:16.262 --> 34:20.987
And if you go to the British Museum today, there's the original copy right there.

34:21.087 --> 34:21.447
I see.

34:21.788 --> 34:22.148
Anyway.

34:22.368 --> 34:27.254
You know, the old Norse mythology was saved in a similar way.

34:28.255 --> 34:30.578
It's a book from the, in the 13th century.

34:30.978 --> 34:34.562
In a way, it's a description of the old Norse mythology.

34:35.116 --> 34:39.582
And there is one codex, you know, one manuscript that was found.

34:39.883 --> 34:40.644
Codex, yes.

34:40.964 --> 34:41.966
That was found.

34:41.986 --> 34:43.388
That codex in Copenhagen.

34:43.708 --> 34:44.109
Really?

34:44.269 --> 34:45.511
Very interesting.

34:45.932 --> 34:48.075
Very, very interesting, yes.

34:48.095 --> 34:52.121
Let's get back to the book and then let's chat because I have to get enough of my story.

34:52.521 --> 35:02.676
You were talking about your... When you discovered that you were a storyteller,

35:03.145 --> 35:06.029
Did you realize this?

35:06.049 --> 35:06.470
No.

35:06.490 --> 35:13.580
Well, I realized that I was a real, that I was a storyteller in the previous book, the book before that, The Mystery of Cards.

35:15.182 --> 35:19.789
Here, in this book, it was the necessity of telling a story.

35:20.250 --> 35:29.383
Because I failed telling about philosophy without using the, what do you say in English, genre?

35:29.403 --> 35:30.344
Styles.

35:30.424 --> 35:32.407
What do they say?

35:32.447 --> 35:33.068
G-E-N-R-S.

35:33.470 --> 35:35.093
Genre.

35:38.178 --> 35:46.130
So I failed using the textbook genre.

35:46.571 --> 35:48.774
I had to invent the story.

35:49.395 --> 35:59.832
I think that the human brain is made for stories more than for digital knowledge.

36:00.200 --> 36:06.449
You know, like, you know, talking about the Greek tradition, you know, Homeros?

36:07.290 --> 36:07.911
Homer.

36:07.931 --> 36:09.653
Homer, you know?

36:09.773 --> 36:10.114
Homer.

36:10.134 --> 36:11.736
You know, of course, it's a story.

36:11.976 --> 36:13.518
How could people remember this?

36:14.299 --> 36:15.060
Because it's a story.

36:15.661 --> 36:17.243
It was oral tradition.

36:17.444 --> 36:18.665
It was passed on oral tradition.

36:18.685 --> 36:19.587
Yes, oral tradition.

36:19.627 --> 36:20.668
For many hundreds of years.

36:20.688 --> 36:21.129
That's right.

36:21.669 --> 36:23.872
And very well was passed on very well.

36:23.892 --> 36:26.796
Because the Odyssey is much better than the Iliad.

36:26.816 --> 36:27.237
That's right.

36:27.537 --> 36:29.999
And it was passed on well, obviously.

36:30.900 --> 36:32.782
You can't see the hand of one writer.

36:33.062 --> 36:34.444
No, no.

36:34.464 --> 36:36.926
You think so, you can or you can't?

36:37.247 --> 36:39.469
No, I mean, that's Homer.

36:39.529 --> 36:41.090
Maybe it's not only one man.

36:41.611 --> 36:44.033
Maybe a tradition, the Homeric tradition.

36:44.113 --> 36:50.460
Yeah, but there is belief that Homer had to be somebody who, it is a story.

36:50.540 --> 36:54.844
I don't know, the same about Shakespeare.

36:55.077 --> 37:02.626
There's only one instance that I can think of where a committee has actually created a work of art.

37:03.107 --> 37:04.489
That's the King James Bible.

37:05.330 --> 37:11.918
You've got all these poets together, and they did this wonderful version of the Bible, and that was a committee.

37:12.258 --> 37:15.162
But otherwise, I think one person has to do a work of art.

37:15.462 --> 37:17.485
Maybe you disagree with that, I don't know.

37:17.685 --> 37:19.347
No, no, no.

37:19.462 --> 37:25.588
I think that that is a very good argument for that Homer must be one person.

37:26.168 --> 37:29.311
But there are also... No, no, I don't know.

37:29.392 --> 37:31.233
I'm not an expert at all of this.

37:31.373 --> 37:38.881
So I think that it's just like some people, they are saying that Shakespeare was written by a lot of people.

37:39.401 --> 37:42.884
You see one mind behind it.

37:42.904 --> 37:45.967
Shakespeare is one of my abiding passions in life.

37:46.768 --> 37:47.249
Yeah.

37:47.409 --> 37:47.629
And...

37:48.419 --> 37:53.426
No, this is one... He was the original existentialist, I think.

37:53.586 --> 37:54.107
That's right.

37:54.127 --> 37:58.113
When you say to be or not to be, that's our third grade English.

37:58.273 --> 37:59.475
All one-syllable words.

38:00.196 --> 38:02.519
To be or not to be.

38:02.639 --> 38:04.382
All one-syllable words.

38:04.482 --> 38:06.865
And then you can take... That is right.

38:06.885 --> 38:08.848
You go nine words before you take a question.

38:08.868 --> 38:09.669
That's two syllables.

38:09.749 --> 38:10.350
To be or not to be.

38:10.590 --> 38:18.021
And that is exactly, actually, for instance, kind in, let's say, you know, Sartre, sound called Sartre.

38:18.760 --> 38:33.255
I get several letters from young people.

38:33.275 --> 38:37.159
And from girls, mostly girls.

38:37.920 --> 38:42.605
In general, girls are reading more than boys after they are ten years old.

38:43.786 --> 38:47.130
And very often they say that, I have read your book.

38:48.072 --> 39:14.181
or i talk to them and i say really did you read all of it well when i came to hegel you know hegel it was a little difficult i just have some faces but i had to read it through to see how it was with sophie and hilde you know so that was the epic genre that kept them really

39:14.448 --> 39:18.232
So half a million Germans would not buy a book on philosophy.

39:18.953 --> 39:22.717
But a novel about the book of philosophy, that is it.

39:22.737 --> 39:24.619
I believe in the story very much.

39:24.779 --> 39:27.242
I think I'm not afraid that the books will die.

39:28.123 --> 39:28.943
No, I don't think so.

39:28.964 --> 39:35.390
As long as people have stories to tell, books will come out.

39:37.092 --> 39:43.459
So it could be... I left the project as a textbook.

39:44.603 --> 39:48.026
I just call it a project.

39:48.607 --> 39:58.675
Yes, in a way, it was a project because what I wanted to do was, you know, to give this world perspective on history to other people.

39:59.756 --> 40:02.359
Because it's so important for me.

40:02.379 --> 40:11.287
I mean, to... You know, I am not only living my own life.

40:12.928 --> 40:13.969
I have...

40:14.692 --> 40:19.177
I identify myself with something that is bigger than me.

40:19.197 --> 40:26.244
I'm not only my first name, I am a European.

40:26.804 --> 40:34.693
I take part, I am a part of, and I'm a participant in something that is greater than me.

40:34.713 --> 40:41.880
If I did identify myself only with my physical ego, I would be a hopeless person.

40:42.029 --> 40:47.117
But I do identify myself with the human tradition.

40:48.159 --> 40:49.561
And this is so important for me.

40:51.184 --> 41:04.606
We live in a so-called post-modern mass society where we are walking in piles of mosaics.

41:04.666 --> 41:07.851
We are living in the great cities

41:08.067 --> 41:10.330
we don't see the connections in life.

41:13.215 --> 41:24.291
You know, the postmodernism, they have tried to deconstruct the novel, the film, the metaphysics, the theology.

41:25.453 --> 41:32.403
And I think that in a way, under the surface, people are in a lack of the reconstruction.

41:32.844 --> 41:37.551
What I wanted to do was to reconstruct this mosaic.

41:38.459 --> 41:43.043
We all need some sort of a picture of life, a world picture.

41:43.063 --> 41:52.853
You know what it said, some of the things that I've read about the book is that you really have succeeded in the job of explaining the various concepts.

41:53.573 --> 42:05.665
You can't clearly, it can't be a detail, it's not a college course in philosophy, but you do provide an introduction to people on these

42:05.898 --> 42:15.551
I hope that some people then will want to read more.

42:16.211 --> 42:24.763
I mean, do you have in English the expression tabloids?

42:25.564 --> 42:30.370
You may say that in a way this book is a philosophical tabloid.

42:30.873 --> 42:31.334
Wow.

42:32.015 --> 42:32.115
Okay.

42:32.135 --> 42:39.106
But what I want to do is to awaken curiosity.

42:39.307 --> 42:39.888
People's curiosity.

42:39.968 --> 42:41.470
And make it accessible, I guess.

42:41.590 --> 42:42.271
Accessible.

42:42.852 --> 42:45.316
And also, that's a good word you can remember.

42:45.737 --> 42:46.939
Accessible.

42:46.999 --> 42:48.141
Accessible.

42:48.241 --> 42:48.622
That's right.

42:48.642 --> 42:49.383
Accessible.

42:49.443 --> 42:51.326
To make it accessible.

42:51.386 --> 42:51.987
Something that many...

42:52.253 --> 43:11.798
my motto when i wrote the book my my my own private motto was philosophy for all you know that's that's exactly exactly so what i now of course i'm very curious about is what is america

43:11.997 --> 43:14.460
They are relating to this book.

43:14.480 --> 43:21.607
And let's say for the record here on this case that, as you're saying this, you've only been here for about three hours, right?

43:22.948 --> 43:23.449
Exactly.

43:23.529 --> 43:26.112
And so how long are you going to be here?

43:26.132 --> 43:27.233
For one week.

43:27.253 --> 43:28.574
For one week, and where are you going?

43:28.915 --> 43:32.779
I will mainly be here in New York, and then I will go to Wattingham.

43:34.541 --> 43:39.726
And so then the book will come out, and then you'll see how... It comes out tomorrow.

43:40.347 --> 43:41.989
You'll see what the response is.

43:42.009 --> 43:44.331
Yes, I will.

43:44.351 --> 43:46.413
And, of course, it's a huge country.

43:46.573 --> 43:49.756
It's 250 million people.

43:49.776 --> 44:04.729
And I imagine you hope that this... Well, what I really hope is that... I really hope that I'm not so concerned about numbers.

44:04.749 --> 44:09.814
But I hope that this can mean something for some people.

44:10.435 --> 44:18.067
It's not a reboot for all people, but perhaps it is a reboot for some people.

44:18.127 --> 44:21.593
How do you explain the phenomenal reception in Germany?

44:22.875 --> 44:24.037
That is unbelievable.

44:24.157 --> 44:27.582
That is absolutely extraordinary.

44:27.683 --> 44:28.884
Unbelievable, really.

44:28.904 --> 44:36.156
And I didn't expect it, but I think that, first of all,

44:37.402 --> 44:42.955
The first thing I mentioned was that philosophy is interesting and important, but too difficult.

44:43.576 --> 44:44.498
Now it's accessible.

44:45.280 --> 44:46.363
For me.

44:46.383 --> 44:53.098
Second, we have lost the common Agora, and we need something, all the things in common.

44:53.517 --> 45:03.528
We cannot watch all the TV channels, but we can all know who's good to him, who Shakespeare was, who Aristoteles and Plato was, you know?

45:04.529 --> 45:06.370
We need a common language.

45:06.391 --> 45:09.093
We need to refer to something in common.

45:09.153 --> 45:10.114
That's my second theory.

45:10.315 --> 45:22.107
My third theory is also that we have had this new age philosophy, this instant philosophy for some years, and I think in a way people are now getting a little tired of it.

45:23.032 --> 45:26.817
And they want the real stuff, if you understand what I mean.

45:26.877 --> 45:33.265
In a way, talking about this, I call it instant philosophy.

45:34.066 --> 45:37.451
Like, we live in an instant society.

45:37.471 --> 45:45.541
You can have instant food, and pornography is giving you an instant access to erotic.

45:47.123 --> 45:52.650
This new age, but we, nobody really needs

45:53.018 --> 45:57.926
What we really want is love, and love takes time.

45:57.946 --> 45:59.268
Knowledge too takes time.

45:59.668 --> 46:01.471
Knowledge takes time.

46:01.491 --> 46:09.724
And there are no shortcuts, neither to re-love nor to philosophical insight.

46:09.924 --> 46:21.422
So I think that in a way I would call a lot of this alternative philosophy, I would call it philosophical pornography.

46:22.027 --> 46:24.510
Now, even though you're not teaching the school anymore.

46:24.650 --> 46:25.171
Not anymore.

46:25.331 --> 46:28.235
But you still consider yourself a teacher, I'm sure.

46:28.255 --> 46:30.237
Yes, in a way, as a man in the world.

46:31.078 --> 46:37.866
But I also very much enjoy listening.

46:38.747 --> 46:45.556
And not only talking myself, of course.

46:47.037 --> 46:51.763
You seem more engaged by the question than you do by whatever the answer might be.

46:52.655 --> 47:01.506
It is really intelligent what you remarked now.

47:01.886 --> 47:08.554
Because very often journalists meet, they ask me, who is your favorite philosopher?

47:08.574 --> 47:09.776
But you didn't ask that question.

47:10.196 --> 47:12.859
Because you understand what is really true.

47:13.120 --> 47:17.565
I am more interested in the questions themselves than in the

47:18.170 --> 47:20.032
Give them answers through history.

47:20.492 --> 47:22.314
I mean, there is no answer.

47:22.394 --> 47:22.995
In a way, no.

47:23.836 --> 47:26.599
But then, you know, the questions can be important.

47:26.619 --> 47:30.683
Because let's say I ask the question, where does the world come from?

47:30.803 --> 47:35.068
Even though I cannot grasp an answer, there is an answer.

47:35.568 --> 47:42.135
You know, it's just like it's a murder that's committed here between Clark and Lexington Avenue.

47:42.706 --> 47:45.391
The police will ask that question, who committed this murder?

47:45.411 --> 47:47.756
Somebody did, even if we don't know who did it.

47:47.856 --> 47:48.878
There is an answer.

47:49.219 --> 47:50.662
And that is thrilling.

47:50.742 --> 47:53.126
Can you say that name is thrilling?

47:53.227 --> 47:53.708
Thrilling.

47:53.728 --> 47:54.950
Thrilling, what do you say for me?

47:54.990 --> 47:55.591
Thrilling.

47:55.732 --> 47:56.212
Thrilling, yes.

47:56.333 --> 47:57.034
Thrilling.

47:57.054 --> 47:57.836
Very thrilling.

47:57.896 --> 47:59.299
There is a concern.

47:59.359 --> 48:05.170
And also if I ask a question, is there some sort of a God behind the universe?

48:05.723 --> 48:09.987
Well, either the list or not.

48:10.208 --> 48:15.873
I was going to get to that, but you suggested that earlier.

48:15.893 --> 48:22.600
It's the first time if a man gets this, that I'm more interested in the questions.

48:22.921 --> 48:31.950
I walk on the beach in the ocean with my daughter, and she says to me, Danny, do you think it's possible to know how many grains of sand there are?

48:32.521 --> 48:35.765
And I say, it's impossible to know, but there is a number.

48:36.426 --> 48:40.811
The number is, there is a number.

48:41.471 --> 48:47.478
And also, no one knows, none of us know, but there's a number.

48:48.259 --> 48:52.504
And even though God might know, maybe not.

48:52.905 --> 49:00.814
And even though the answer then is behind my neck, and I'm sitting in this cave, you know, but there's a number.

49:00.834 --> 49:01.735
I want to...

49:02.069 --> 49:06.153
Turn around and see them.

49:06.173 --> 49:08.095
How many stars are there in the sky?

49:08.115 --> 49:08.835
That's right.

49:08.855 --> 49:09.796
No one will ever know.

49:09.996 --> 49:10.257
That's right.

49:10.277 --> 49:11.398
No human will ever know.

49:11.478 --> 49:13.219
And we have heard about it.

49:13.239 --> 49:14.781
But there is a number, I'm sure.

49:14.801 --> 49:16.022
And we have heard about the Big Bang.

49:16.743 --> 49:17.604
What happened before?

49:17.644 --> 49:19.445
What gave the Big Bang?

49:20.546 --> 49:24.250
And also, let's take another philosophical question then.

49:25.311 --> 49:26.352
What is important for me?

49:26.832 --> 49:30.996
When we look at the history, all the stars,

49:31.381 --> 49:35.727
and the history of this planet and the history of life.

49:36.749 --> 49:42.577
Is there any purpose, any teleology behind the universe?

49:43.739 --> 49:45.161
Or is everything by accident?

49:47.384 --> 49:56.697
You know, the history about life here on this planet is, in a way, the history of how life and lures

49:57.503 --> 50:01.107
are becoming more and more and more complicated.

50:01.387 --> 50:01.768
Complex.

50:02.328 --> 50:03.890
Complex.

50:03.910 --> 50:05.992
Is this something just by accident?

50:06.773 --> 50:09.436
Or is there some sort of a purpose?

50:09.456 --> 50:10.257
That question is important.

50:10.277 --> 50:12.839
Is there even a purpose or a design?

50:12.959 --> 50:13.280
A design?

50:13.500 --> 50:14.141
A design.

50:14.581 --> 50:14.882
A design.

50:14.942 --> 50:15.662
That's right.

50:15.903 --> 50:17.985
A purpose is almost takes on a moral sense.

50:18.005 --> 50:19.506
That's right.

50:19.526 --> 50:19.647
Okay.

50:19.667 --> 50:22.870
A design is almost structured.

50:23.339 --> 50:26.544
It's not an expression as teleology.

50:26.744 --> 50:27.025
Exactly.

50:27.545 --> 50:28.567
So I agree.

50:28.807 --> 50:31.311
That is very good that you tell me.

50:31.351 --> 50:32.833
You would say design.

50:33.154 --> 50:34.396
I would say.

50:34.636 --> 50:36.118
Somebody else might say purpose.

50:36.138 --> 50:37.040
That's right.

50:37.080 --> 50:39.023
To me, purpose is intent.

50:39.043 --> 50:40.966
And I'm not saying it's an intent.

50:41.046 --> 50:41.587
Intention.

50:41.887 --> 50:43.429
Is there any intention behind it?

50:43.509 --> 50:45.853
Whoever designed the human body...

50:46.812 --> 50:51.420
Was there a purpose there, or they were designed to make a perfect machine?

50:51.580 --> 50:58.952
They're wonderful, but they're nothing compared to the systems built here.

50:59.313 --> 51:00.395
They work beautifully.

51:00.515 --> 51:04.041
They definitely break down, and then they have replacement files.

51:04.121 --> 51:08.949
There's nothing in the intention behind the universe.

51:09.430 --> 51:13.056
From our intention, you see, is a very interesting word.

51:13.559 --> 51:25.531
I personally believe at some point, long after we're all gone, I believe it's a very rational answer to that.

51:25.551 --> 51:28.974
It's totally beyond our consciousness.

51:29.054 --> 51:33.518
Whatever hand is there, it has some cosmic meaning.

51:33.819 --> 51:36.301
It's way beyond that.

51:36.641 --> 51:40.225
It's comprehensible at some level.

51:40.285 --> 51:41.406
Not at this level.

51:42.078 --> 51:46.664
And also I think that it may be a more... No, but we never know, you know.

51:48.187 --> 52:02.046
But I think that to teach young people to ask questions is important.

52:02.066 --> 52:10.077
When I was a teacher, you know, I always, not always, very often, when I had my course on philosophy,

52:10.478 --> 52:14.182
five hours, lessons per week.

52:14.602 --> 52:17.785
I said the first hour, first lesson.

52:17.805 --> 52:22.089
Now, ask all the questions you would like to have the answer on.

52:22.109 --> 52:25.492
And then they asked, where does the university like me to speak?

52:25.732 --> 52:28.695
And then they asked questions about family life.

52:29.856 --> 52:32.959
And then after five minutes, they were fired.

52:33.760 --> 52:34.901
No more questions.

52:34.921 --> 52:36.823
I said, we will do nothing.

52:37.462 --> 53:06.102
for how long time had the human beings had

53:06.250 --> 53:07.512
The ability to talk.

53:09.255 --> 53:14.482
They discussed it, of course, you cannot answer that question.

53:14.502 --> 53:20.832
Then I said, okay, how... How long have they had their ability to write?

53:21.172 --> 53:23.236
You know, written control.

53:23.256 --> 53:27.742
Then they come to 20,000 years, 2,000 years.

53:28.543 --> 53:31.768
No, we concluded, let's say about 6,000 years.

53:31.788 --> 53:34.232
Or 5, okay, you know?

53:34.668 --> 53:35.749
Like that.

53:36.190 --> 53:38.993
The very oldest stereoglyphs maybe has.

53:39.134 --> 53:40.355
Oh, that's hilarious.

53:40.856 --> 53:41.597
That's right.

53:42.578 --> 53:46.663
And then, for instance, when was the middle age?

53:47.404 --> 53:51.029
And then one boy said, the 18th century?

53:51.850 --> 53:52.951
No, no, I said no.

53:53.532 --> 53:58.058
And now their curiosity was awakened.

53:59.199 --> 54:01.522
Then we could start.

54:01.542 --> 54:03.004
So the questions are important.

54:03.693 --> 54:15.953
And even if there's no challenge in the answer, you know, the fact that the mind is thinking, I think the two questions you pick, who am I?

54:18.737 --> 54:22.684
Just by asking it, it will in a way enlarge our feeling about life.

54:22.824 --> 54:26.089
And then of course if you look at the Bible, in the beginning God made

54:26.660 --> 54:28.182
Or a body?

54:28.963 --> 54:34.089
Maybe, maybe.

54:34.590 --> 54:40.617
You know, even in the Bible, you do have a philosophical part.

54:40.637 --> 54:47.926
For instance, you know, the book called What do you say?

54:47.946 --> 54:49.287
What is the English word?

54:50.869 --> 54:52.892
The book called Job, of course.

54:54.053 --> 54:55.655
You know?

54:55.675 --> 54:55.755
Job.

54:56.731 --> 55:00.518
And the Book of the Preacher, the Preacher.

55:00.658 --> 55:16.208
And also the Book of the Preacher in the Old Testament.

55:16.492 --> 55:21.178
He's saying, everything is empty.

55:21.258 --> 55:27.266
So, you are completely right.

55:27.326 --> 55:45.189
You know, I've heard that people are forced to ask a question in four different ways.

55:45.209 --> 55:46.330
You know,

55:46.816 --> 55:56.407
Asking questions, I have that right here.

55:56.687 --> 56:03.294
I always get the question, what is my favorite philosopher, and then I say that I'm more interested in the question.

56:03.515 --> 56:07.319
Well, I haven't asked you that.

56:07.439 --> 56:10.783
I'm asking Joseph Keller who's your favorite author.

56:10.823 --> 56:13.305
Who do you read?

56:13.325 --> 56:14.747
And also, of course,

56:15.318 --> 56:40.532
the different philosophers they have different projects like the critocratic philosophers they want to examine the nature socrates wants to examine justice platos and aristotle is the forms in nature you know and like that i have a quote from socrates in my book you know remember the use of demons

56:40.968 --> 56:55.802
This saying about, you know, the oracle in Delphi was asked who is the white person, individual, in Athens.

56:55.822 --> 56:58.745
And then it was Socrates.

56:58.765 --> 57:00.407
And he didn't know anything.

57:01.408 --> 57:07.093
But then all the people pretending that they knew, of course they were not so white.

57:07.343 --> 57:14.431
You have a Latin expression.

57:14.511 --> 57:15.472
Docta ignorantia.

57:16.213 --> 57:20.638
The learned not knowing.

57:20.658 --> 57:21.539
Ignorantia.

57:21.659 --> 57:22.801
Ignorance, you know.

57:23.061 --> 57:24.262
The learned ignorance.

57:24.483 --> 57:27.706
Docta ignorantia.

57:27.726 --> 57:32.472
Which is like old people, you know.

57:32.972 --> 57:36.556
They weave this stadium.

57:36.737 --> 57:37.097
You know.

57:37.465 --> 58:02.123
very often 11 12 years old boys they feel they know everything i just want to make sure i have all the questions i think it's kind of cute that sophie's mother kind of suspect something going on here and there is

58:02.322 --> 58:14.539
I think I asked you a question and I must have interrupted you, but did you see yourself when you envisioned not?

58:15.100 --> 58:17.904
Yes, you asked me it better.

58:18.404 --> 58:25.594
You know, of course, in a way, he is taking over the role as a teacher for me.

58:26.135 --> 58:29.680
You know, it was a very beautiful thing for me.

58:29.828 --> 58:34.453
that now I could use another philosopher than myself.

58:35.234 --> 58:38.337
A man that could be a little more ironic, a little rougher.

58:38.817 --> 58:39.979
You say ruff?

58:40.299 --> 58:40.639
Ruffer.

58:41.060 --> 58:45.084
And a little more plain, playful, a little more than me, you know?

58:45.404 --> 58:46.846
Because we like textbooks.

58:48.047 --> 58:52.432
This genre is very narrow.

58:53.333 --> 58:58.418
We have now looked at this, and now we will look at that, you know?

58:58.786 --> 58:59.787
It's very boring.

59:00.408 --> 59:02.971
So here you take over the role as a teacher.

59:04.092 --> 59:11.602
When we use the word genre in fiction, it's to describe like a mystery or a science fiction.

59:11.622 --> 59:11.982
I think.

59:12.102 --> 59:13.844
A specific kind of writing.

59:14.465 --> 59:17.589
What I mean is drama.

59:17.829 --> 59:18.570
Drama.

59:18.730 --> 59:21.393
You're using novel and a much wider set.

59:21.414 --> 59:21.954
Here's him.

59:22.495 --> 59:24.898
In a literary sense, not even literary.

59:25.018 --> 59:28.422
When you say a person writes within a genre,

59:29.245 --> 59:32.151
He writes a mystery.

59:33.434 --> 59:36.280
He writes a detective story.

59:36.421 --> 59:37.623
But what was the effect?

59:37.643 --> 59:44.458
If you have poetry, if you have novels, you have prose and novels, you know?

59:44.478 --> 59:45.541
Okay, I wouldn't use a text.

59:45.561 --> 59:46.503
I wouldn't use a journal.

59:46.523 --> 59:47.886
What would you use?

59:48.788 --> 59:48.908
Style?

59:49.276 --> 59:57.930
You have nonfiction, you have fiction, you have drama, you have poetry, but I wouldn't call those genres.

59:57.950 --> 59:59.773
I just wouldn't even use the word.

01:00:00.374 --> 01:00:04.440
The genre does identify a kind of fiction writing.

01:00:04.821 --> 01:00:06.684
Okay, I see.

01:00:06.704 --> 01:00:15.638
And it's usually used to put down the very formulae, as if Peggy for Christy was a genre writer.

01:00:15.803 --> 01:00:17.646
You know, detective novels.

01:00:18.227 --> 01:00:20.931
In Norway, we, we, we, we, I know.

01:00:20.971 --> 01:00:22.654
Don't call yourself a genre writer.

01:00:22.694 --> 01:00:26.059
No, because in Norway, at the school, we don't.

01:00:26.139 --> 01:00:31.127
I won't use it by school either, because it's not what you mean, I understand.

01:00:31.167 --> 01:00:37.277
You know, in Norway, because he, of course, this book is, you know, this is a fiction.

01:00:37.297 --> 01:00:37.477
Right.

01:00:37.497 --> 01:00:38.519
But also typical.

01:00:38.539 --> 01:00:40.562
Yes, but he, you are right, it is a novel.

01:00:40.846 --> 01:00:44.992
Well, it says right here, a novel about the history of philosophy.

01:00:45.032 --> 01:00:46.635
That's very good that they did that.

01:00:46.895 --> 01:00:57.391
Yes, I think so, because people... I was very glad that I... No, I wrote this.

01:00:57.451 --> 01:00:58.052
Oh, really?

01:00:58.372 --> 01:00:59.955
Because I called it Sophie's World.

01:01:00.876 --> 01:01:04.542
You know, the history of Sophie and the history of philosophy.

01:01:04.662 --> 01:01:07.406
And then I wrote it.

01:01:08.588 --> 01:01:09.469
I wrote about it, yes.

01:01:09.736 --> 01:01:11.325
Thank you.
