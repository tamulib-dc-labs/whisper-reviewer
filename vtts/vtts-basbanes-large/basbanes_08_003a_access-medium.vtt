WEBVTT

00:02.950 --> 00:05.455
So tell me.

00:05.475 --> 00:08.280
Tell me how this project started.

00:08.340 --> 00:09.522
How did this come about?

00:09.542 --> 00:10.905
Yeah.

00:10.985 --> 00:24.410
Well... Let me just preface it by saying I'm really astounded by having seen two volumes of extraordinary letters by important women writers in the last year.

00:24.590 --> 00:26.494
We had Elizabeth Bishop Slayer in the last year.

00:26.660 --> 00:33.226
I think these are probably in that kind of a category, because they really are revelatory, aren't they?

00:34.688 --> 00:41.315
In lieu of an autobiography, this more or less serves, do you think?

00:41.895 --> 00:46.640
Why don't we use that as a watch?

00:46.700 --> 00:53.967
Yeah, I certainly feel that it's a wonderful autobiography.

00:55.465 --> 01:18.259
in part because it's a dialogue, and I think, one, you really show more of yourself in relationship to others, so that I think seeing Rachel in her dialogue with my grandmother, and we might even be seeing more of her than we would if she had just sat down by herself to tend her thoughts about herself.

01:18.519 --> 01:23.987
Now, I interviewed Robert Giroux last year on the occasion of the Bishop List,

01:24.608 --> 01:28.552
What was amazing about the Bishop Brothers is how carefully she crafted.

01:28.572 --> 01:29.593
She really cared.

01:30.454 --> 01:39.883
Even though it was correspondence, there was maybe this expectation that these would be read down the road, and they really had to be written well.

01:40.583 --> 01:43.846
Do you sense a similar feeling here?

01:44.487 --> 01:53.856
I do have a sense, I'm sure, that Rachel, she had mixed feelings about...

01:54.713 --> 02:00.720
whether she wanted her private life to become more public at some time after her death.

02:00.740 --> 02:06.327
But I think she definitely had a thought that through these letters that might be the case.

02:06.347 --> 02:10.933
So I think I agree with you that she took care in writing these.

02:10.953 --> 02:20.805
But also when you're dealing with people who are great writers in their lives, their letters are probably going to be pretty well written no matter what.

02:21.511 --> 02:23.253
Well, have you ever looked at Hemingway's letters?

02:23.393 --> 02:24.755
Well, yeah.

02:24.775 --> 02:26.117
Great women writers?

02:26.337 --> 02:30.142
Oh, I don't know.

02:30.162 --> 02:32.305
Evelyn Water's letters are interesting.

02:32.325 --> 02:39.234
They used to say, I forget which is which, but one of the letters were lovely, but the journal was a mess.

02:39.514 --> 02:45.662
But they figured he wrote the letters in the morning when he was sober, and the journal at night when he was drunk.

02:46.790 --> 02:48.252
That would be a great study.

02:49.294 --> 02:54.561
In other words, they came out almost coincidentally at the same time.

02:54.581 --> 02:59.148
These were entrusted to you by your grandmother.

02:59.168 --> 03:01.512
What were the marching orders, so to speak?

03:02.333 --> 03:10.124
Not a lot of marching orders, just that she had come to feel over the years that she had held them in her care.

03:12.227 --> 03:13.489
That there was

03:14.735 --> 03:19.760
new wonderful writing by Rachel Carson in there that maybe should see the light of day.

03:19.820 --> 03:26.667
That was her interest in it, is just more wonderful writing by Rachel and the story of Silent Spring, I think.

03:27.948 --> 03:36.477
And she cared a lot that I enjoy what I could learn from their friendship.

03:36.517 --> 03:42.683
She cared a lot about me and I think felt that there was a lot for me to learn about.

03:43.844 --> 03:47.689
becoming a woman in reading these.

03:48.690 --> 03:50.693
Did these serve that?

03:51.554 --> 03:52.115
Oh, yeah.

03:52.195 --> 03:53.156
I'm really glad.

03:53.957 --> 03:56.060
I mean, people ask me, wow, it took you so long.

03:56.420 --> 03:58.503
It took you 12 years to get this done.

03:58.843 --> 04:00.045
It didn't seem all that long to me.

04:01.066 --> 04:08.856
I'm pretty glad that this book has come out when I'm kind of at midlife as opposed to when I was a lot younger, I think I got.

04:09.308 --> 04:12.031
I don't think you could have done it as a younger woman.

04:12.051 --> 04:13.292
No, I don't think I could have.

04:13.312 --> 04:16.035
I don't think I would have had the feeling for the story.

04:16.515 --> 04:31.511
I felt as I was reading, you know, that I, in part, you know, there's so much I felt, but one of the things was, wow, I am reading a great story, and I get the story of women's lives trying to deal with children and work and health and elderly parents and all that.

04:31.791 --> 04:32.572
I get that now.

04:32.872 --> 04:33.653
I wouldn't have gotten that.

04:33.833 --> 04:37.537
Did it emerge for you as a narrative, as a continuing story?

04:37.557 --> 04:37.857
It did.

04:37.877 --> 04:38.758
It did.

04:38.907 --> 04:41.089
And so tell me a little bit about the parameters.

04:41.109 --> 04:44.093
I mean, did it have a beginning, a middle, and an end for you?

04:45.174 --> 04:55.665
Like Pepys's diary, it does have a beginning, a middle, and even though it's a million and a half words or whatever, there is this literary quality to it.

04:56.366 --> 04:57.887
Yeah, I felt that.

04:58.708 --> 05:08.138
That, you know, there was the beginning of the relationship and all the excitement of that and the wanting to share

05:08.337 --> 05:13.504
everything, everything they saw, everything they felt, everything they thought with each other.

05:13.544 --> 05:26.400
And then the sort of settling down into accepting both of them feeling that this was a permanent and important relationship in their lives, that it was going to be there.

05:27.301 --> 05:32.248
And so sharing more of the day-to-day and the story of Rachel as a writer.

05:32.288 --> 05:37.855
And then the ending coming as...

05:38.105 --> 05:42.892
The health problems began to emerge, and then Silent Spring.

05:48.721 --> 06:03.483
All of that, that's sort of the muddle in the middle, is the health problems, the taking on Silent Spring, my grandparents' concern about what was going to be the public reaction, the public trauma that Rachel might go through as the author of that.

06:04.325 --> 06:05.326
Would people understand?

06:05.366 --> 06:06.508
Would they accept it?

06:06.978 --> 06:35.247
real courage and strength and willpower and all that and then and sort of the resolution um the end of sort of for her the happy ending of silent spring in the midst of the very sad but i think she did live long just long enough just long enough to know and that's so wonderful yeah a great book yeah and so the satisfaction of knowing that she knew and then also that she had come to i think

06:36.037 --> 06:38.159
real peace about her life.

06:38.319 --> 06:47.087
Her life had been a long, full life, even though in many ways we would say it was too short, but she sure had lived.

06:48.128 --> 06:52.231
Tell me a little bit about yourself, your own background, coming to the project.

06:52.251 --> 06:53.773
Yeah, well, I'm a manor.

06:54.854 --> 06:55.474
I went to Bates.

06:55.935 --> 06:56.255
Did you?

06:56.275 --> 06:58.137
My parents went to Bates, where they met.

06:58.377 --> 06:59.578
You really went?

07:00.318 --> 07:04.322
Oh, God, well, they graduated in 48.

07:04.842 --> 07:05.803
Well before me.

07:05.823 --> 07:06.423
Good for you.

07:08.765 --> 07:09.466
Right.

07:09.486 --> 07:11.448
I'm getting a little scared here.

07:11.468 --> 07:12.849
You're your classmates now.

07:13.269 --> 07:15.111
No, no.

07:15.131 --> 07:15.331
Excuse me.

07:15.351 --> 07:15.631
No.

07:16.332 --> 07:21.576
So, I went to college in Massachusetts.

07:21.596 --> 07:21.856
Where?

07:22.317 --> 07:23.798
At Hampshire College in Amherst.

07:23.818 --> 07:24.158
Nice school.

07:24.498 --> 07:25.179
Yeah, great school.

07:25.299 --> 07:27.001
Do you know Aaron Lansky out there?

07:27.881 --> 07:28.882
You know who he is?

07:28.942 --> 07:29.583
Yeah, yeah.

07:29.603 --> 07:30.423
He's a skin in my book.

07:30.824 --> 07:32.465
He's a national Jewish book set.

07:32.485 --> 07:34.647
He's a fanatic about it.

07:34.795 --> 07:36.777
preserving the language.

07:36.797 --> 07:36.897
Yeah.

07:37.778 --> 07:38.519
Well, Hampshire was great.

07:38.539 --> 07:41.202
I was in the second class ever at Hampshire College.

07:41.222 --> 07:42.003
So that was wonderful.

07:42.023 --> 07:43.304
And I worked in Washington, D.C.

07:43.344 --> 07:48.790
for the Senate Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights at the end of my college career.

07:48.810 --> 07:53.656
And then decided I really wanted to come back to Maine and thought I'd try law school, too.

07:53.736 --> 07:55.037
So I did law school in Maine.

07:56.018 --> 07:57.720
And then... And you stayed.

07:57.740 --> 07:58.461
I stayed, yeah.

07:58.641 --> 08:02.085
There's always a great concern with bright young people in Maine is that

08:02.774 --> 08:04.317
Well, it's wonderful.

08:04.337 --> 08:06.260
I mean, Maine is such a small pond.

08:06.280 --> 08:10.548
You can become a medium-sized fish pretty easily, and you get to know everybody.

08:10.588 --> 08:14.315
So everybody who's doing interesting things in Maine, you know.

08:14.335 --> 08:15.938
I mean, everybody just knows everybody.

08:15.958 --> 08:21.588
So you get to share, and just the entire community life of Maine is wonderful.

08:22.550 --> 08:24.734
I don't know.

08:24.754 --> 08:26.537
I'll put in a few blocks.

08:27.243 --> 08:52.069
um my husband's gonna show up around 1 30 and he can wait for a bit okay good yeah um yeah so what part of maine do you live in um i live now i live in two places i live in hollywell which is near the state capitol because i worked for the maine legislature that's where i practice law

08:52.640 --> 08:59.948
for 14 years, but I left this fall, and I'm now getting a master's degree in counseling at the university again in Portland.

09:00.368 --> 09:04.112
So my husband and I have an apartment in Portland where they're during the week and back at our house for the weekend.

09:04.793 --> 09:05.053
That's nice.

09:05.073 --> 09:06.935
And your husband does what?

09:07.555 --> 09:18.227
He's a professor of public policy, a graduate program in public policy, and director of something called the Muskie Institute at the university, which does... Right, right.

09:19.188 --> 09:21.550
And so they do health care and child welfare research.

09:22.694 --> 09:26.878
So, tell me about, you know, accepting.

09:26.898 --> 09:34.727
Was it a challenge to you, or did you feel a responsibility, something that had to be done, or just a labor of love, or all of the above?

09:34.747 --> 09:35.348
All of the above.

09:35.368 --> 09:39.652
I guess I felt a little responsibility to read them.

09:40.173 --> 09:41.394
How long did you have them?

09:41.414 --> 09:43.056
I mean, were they kind of sitting in a box?

09:44.237 --> 09:45.058
Fifteen years.

09:45.098 --> 09:46.339
You had them for fifteen years?

09:46.359 --> 09:46.800
Yeah.

09:46.840 --> 09:48.782
So how old were you when you received them?

09:48.822 --> 09:49.943
When I got them, I was twenty-five.

09:51.144 --> 09:51.705
Not a kid.

09:52.073 --> 09:53.675
No, no, not a kid.

09:53.956 --> 09:59.403
No, no, but definitely less wise than I am.

09:59.644 --> 10:06.173
But not a kid at all, but just getting out of law school and settling into my own family life and starting up my job and stuff like that.

10:06.193 --> 10:08.877
So it took me three years to settle into that.

10:09.037 --> 10:15.366
And then had more time when the legislature wasn't in session in the summers to start reading them.

10:15.707 --> 10:18.891
And I felt, you know, my grandmother had told me these were special and that

10:19.124 --> 10:22.789
I believe, when my grandmother told me things were special, then I should read them.

10:23.830 --> 10:24.511
So I wanted to.

10:25.012 --> 10:28.477
So that's the extent to which I felt it was a responsibility.

10:28.497 --> 10:32.181
Are there any other family members to whom they could have been entrusted?

10:32.762 --> 10:35.866
My father is my grandmother's only son.

10:36.067 --> 10:37.509
Any siblings?

10:37.529 --> 10:38.129
I have a brother.

10:38.991 --> 10:44.818
I think she felt... She was one of my best friends.

10:45.179 --> 10:46.060
She really was.

10:46.781 --> 10:47.562
And so I think

10:48.233 --> 10:52.018
She probably felt it was a thing for a woman, and I think she would have agreed.

10:52.038 --> 11:05.676
Was there a sense of ceremony when they were turned over, or were they just... No, we started... I'm not reaching here, but I'm just... Yeah, no, no, I mean, it was no... I mean, I really feel a sense of... You really assumed a sense of great responsibility.

11:06.096 --> 11:07.838
Yeah, I guess.

11:07.899 --> 11:11.323
I just think, you know, my book is about the preservation of things.

11:11.603 --> 11:14.427
Yeah, I'm so thrilled in the end having...

11:14.947 --> 11:38.845
read read the letters and been moved by them and found them a great story and really found meaning that touched all kinds of aspects of my life i'm really thrilled to be able to share that experience with other people and have them be moved in whatever ways move them in their lives whatever meanings they find do they come to you chronologically like yeah

11:39.145 --> 11:41.128
She and I got to spend some time together.

11:41.188 --> 11:42.229
Pretty disgusting.

11:42.430 --> 11:45.274
A couple winters, a couple years before she died.

11:46.455 --> 11:49.720
On my visits to her, we would sit and talk about them a little bit, and she showed them.

11:49.760 --> 11:57.251
And she sort of gave me a little glossary of some of their acute terms that are in there and what that means, so I would know.

11:58.052 --> 12:01.276
And then she had them chronologically.

12:01.637 --> 12:03.680
We kind of went through and made sure they were there.

12:03.700 --> 12:05.062
And you read them in that order?

12:05.643 --> 12:06.604
Yep, I did read them.

12:06.719 --> 12:08.301
So it was an unfolding for you then?

12:08.321 --> 12:10.343
It was an unfolding for me, yeah.

12:10.363 --> 12:17.372
Did you start with any kind of, did you come to this with any baggage, so to speak, any preconceptions, or did you have any idea what you were going to learn?

12:19.635 --> 12:20.256
Not really.

12:20.356 --> 12:31.349
I knew, you know, I hadn't known because I had experienced it a bit, but I sure knew from my grandmother that, you know, Rachel was one of the dearest friends she ever had in life.

12:32.511 --> 12:36.135
And so I had the sense that I was

12:36.723 --> 12:41.448
definitely going to be allowed in to their friendship.

12:42.049 --> 12:52.681
And I was curious about what Rachel would be writing behind the scenes as she was working in Silent Spring, what she would be saying about that experience.

12:53.021 --> 12:58.668
But I felt, as I was reading them, I really felt, I wasn't startled by anything.

12:58.788 --> 13:05.295
I felt, yep, these are the ladies I knew and this is my grandmother's love.

13:05.849 --> 13:10.575
This is the quality of her notes, for sure.

13:10.655 --> 13:19.446
Would you remember any thought in your mind that maybe you would use these letters as the raw material for a biography?

13:21.889 --> 13:23.591
No, not for me.

13:25.013 --> 13:35.586
Pretty soon into reading them, my strong feeling was, for my part, I wanted these women to be able to speak for themselves.

13:36.157 --> 13:53.894
I didn't want the part of analyzing very much, and I'm not a big detail person, so I didn't want the part of making sure I'd gotten every date about every event in their lives.

13:53.914 --> 13:56.957
I was happy with the amount of annotations I had to do.

13:58.158 --> 14:05.505
I really wanted to tell their story and let them tell their story in their words, and other people can use

14:06.025 --> 14:12.011
that for all kinds of academic... So really what you've done is furnish the raw material.

14:12.071 --> 14:13.853
Yeah, that's what I wanted to do.

14:13.873 --> 14:16.476
And hope that it's used carefully.

14:17.016 --> 14:27.847
Yeah, and just give them the opportunity to speak in their voices before... It certainly had to be done posthumously with respect to your grandmother, I would think.

14:27.867 --> 14:31.090
Or do you think that she would have... I don't know.

14:31.271 --> 14:35.695
I think she had some thoughts in her 70s that maybe she might

14:36.974 --> 14:41.020
pull it together and find a publisher or something.

14:41.040 --> 14:47.468
But I think she realized by her mid-70s that that was going to be too much of a task for her.

14:48.450 --> 14:57.642
It is understood that there was some discussion that some letters were expected to be destroyed.

14:57.662 --> 15:04.011
Of course, we don't know whether they were or they weren't, but I gather these would have been totally personal things that had nothing to do with.

15:04.987 --> 15:18.159
Yeah, I think the ones that aren't there are either the ones that weren't so interesting and they didn't bother to keep them to them, you know, that they wanted to hold on to.

15:19.039 --> 15:24.644
And then my sense is some that were, as you say, more personal.

15:25.145 --> 15:26.326
I think to some degree.

15:27.507 --> 15:33.272
I get the feeling that my grandmother really served as Rachel's counselor.

15:33.556 --> 15:35.899
You know, I don't want her therapist.

15:35.919 --> 15:38.022
And I'm sure Rachel did the same for my grandmother a bit.

15:38.622 --> 15:41.206
And I think they were very protective of their families.

15:42.187 --> 15:49.476
And that they really were concerned if maybe they had some trouble with one of their family members.

15:49.496 --> 15:53.902
They didn't want that lying around at all for anybody to stumble upon.

15:53.922 --> 15:54.943
So I think those are gone.

15:56.145 --> 16:00.310
So there were no surprises for you, actually?

16:00.831 --> 16:03.394
I guess...

16:03.998 --> 16:05.680
Not about their relationship.

16:05.740 --> 16:11.345
I think I was surprised about, well, two things.

16:11.446 --> 16:15.330
How ill Rachel was when she was doing Sun at Spring.

16:15.350 --> 16:17.872
I mean, I know that cancer got her in the end.

16:19.254 --> 16:32.487
But I guess I hadn't realized that it had been a long kind of ending and how long she really battled it and how ill she felt with that and that she'd had all these other illnesses too.

16:33.142 --> 16:37.768
So I was pretty amazed by her fortitude in that.

16:38.128 --> 16:43.856
And then, of course, my grandfather died four months before she did, so he died when I was ten.

16:43.876 --> 16:51.605
And I had known he had had to have special diets and stuff as we were, as I was growing up with him.

16:52.286 --> 16:55.971
But I guess I hadn't realized how ill he had been.

16:56.011 --> 17:00.837
He died of a heart attack, and I had thought he just died of a heart attack, but his health really was declining, and how

17:02.032 --> 17:02.953
stressful.

17:03.033 --> 17:14.685
That must have been for my grandmother to see both of those people failing and how strong she was to be able to give them both so much support.

17:16.888 --> 17:30.522
And then to carry on in her life, I mean, she, my grandmother, she loved life and she just made new friends, moved to Maine where she'd always wanted to live full time, married again, traveled in Europe.

17:31.002 --> 17:31.583
She didn't

17:32.947 --> 17:39.115
I think for her, loss was part of life, and you kept looking for life, you know.

17:39.135 --> 17:41.818
I noticed you have some added connotations there.

17:41.938 --> 17:42.038
I do.

17:42.078 --> 17:42.759
Why is that?

17:45.142 --> 17:53.051
Because sometimes interviewers ask me to pick a favorite letter, or they want me to point them to a letter on a certain subject.

17:53.272 --> 18:01.722
So orange is the relationship, green is silence, yellow is more on sort of thoughts on immortality, and

18:02.343 --> 18:07.851
of the health, kind of health issues that seem to be where people go to.

18:07.911 --> 18:09.974
Do you have any favorites yourself?

18:10.735 --> 18:23.394
My very favorite letters are that series that starts on February 6th, 1954, and there's a February 13th letter and a February 17th letter by Rachel.

18:24.816 --> 18:30.865
And my grandmother's letters in that period don't exist, but it's just a long dialogue.

18:31.013 --> 18:37.943
that they're caring about their relationship and reflecting on why they've come to care about each other so much.

18:38.084 --> 18:46.897
And I love it because they touch on everything I can imagine about why, but in the end conclude we'll never know.

18:47.538 --> 18:49.421
It's just a splendor and a mystery.

18:49.441 --> 18:53.787
And I just love that sense of life.

18:54.709 --> 18:57.493
You know, just be grateful when love walks in the door.

18:59.633 --> 19:02.737
not try to categorize it or figure it out too much.

19:04.039 --> 19:05.000
Just enjoy it.

19:05.020 --> 19:05.761
That's a great quote.

19:07.824 --> 19:14.533
I think in terms of quotes, I can see them in type, too.

19:15.434 --> 19:19.420
Did you have to read all of Rachel Carson, of course, to prepare yourself?

19:20.581 --> 19:25.848
Well, I had, you know, over the years when I was in college.

19:25.868 --> 19:28.712
I read all of her books.

19:29.468 --> 19:59.003
and i had read paul brooks's house of life professional biography of her um so i kept dipping back into those as i read these but i pretty much had a sense of what she had said in her books and in the contours of her life did he have access to these when he was working on them uh he did to some extent there are a couple of quotes from a couple of these letters in his book and i've got to ask him exactly how that went um

19:59.337 --> 20:10.549
I'm not sure whether he knew their relationship, he knew their huge correspondence, and whether he asked my grandmother to pick out a couple, or whether he actually came and looked through the letters and picked out a few.

20:10.569 --> 20:11.250
I'm not quite sure.

20:11.270 --> 20:15.695
I know as a writer and a researcher, I desperately want to see them.

20:15.715 --> 20:16.075
Right, right.

20:16.095 --> 20:23.183
I wouldn't, frankly, imagine doing the book, knowing that his treasure trove exists.

20:23.283 --> 20:23.744
Yeah.

20:25.045 --> 20:27.488
Well, Paul, I know he felt that his

20:28.430 --> 20:31.895
book was not going to be, you know, the complete biography.

20:31.975 --> 20:36.903
He talks about his book as the professional biography of Rachel.

20:38.305 --> 20:52.005
The emphasis is on her career, and you've got to know about her life to understand her career, but that he really wanted to preserve her posterity, the story of her career more than her personal life.

20:52.025 --> 20:53.948
But certainly she talks about the work here.

20:54.367 --> 20:56.009
It's a great extent, isn't it?

20:56.029 --> 20:56.309
Yeah.

20:56.469 --> 21:05.037
I'm amazed at how shy she is about, not shy, but concerned about hurting people's feelings with the things that she's writing.

21:05.538 --> 21:05.858
Yeah.

21:06.198 --> 21:12.064
I mean, I'm a real pro, because she doesn't worry about that at all.

21:12.344 --> 21:12.784
All right.

21:12.805 --> 21:15.187
You do it, and you just pray that it's correct.

21:15.627 --> 21:16.488
Yeah.

21:16.508 --> 21:17.669
And there's that libeless.

21:18.190 --> 21:18.390
Yeah.

21:18.410 --> 21:19.331
And then you work.

21:19.831 --> 21:20.712
Yeah.

21:21.063 --> 21:23.707
You put it out there and it needs to be fair.

21:23.727 --> 21:24.768
Always be fair.

21:25.930 --> 21:26.230
Yeah, yeah.

21:26.330 --> 21:26.671
You're right.

21:26.691 --> 21:29.595
I don't think the woman could ever be accused of being spiteful or vicious.

21:29.655 --> 21:31.758
No, no.

21:31.778 --> 21:44.376
I don't know if she just was an extra sensitive personality in ways or, you know, a woman of her time writing about what was unorthodox stuff for a woman of her time.

21:44.396 --> 21:50.344
I mean, being a scientist and, you know, whether she was sort of hypersensitive to

21:51.455 --> 21:57.442
just her position and, you know, not wanting to rock the boat.

21:57.542 --> 21:59.104
I'm not sure where that came from.

21:59.124 --> 22:00.426
I agree with you, though.

22:00.486 --> 22:08.495
I read someplace or heard someplace that Al Gore said he wrote his book on the environment with a picture of Rachel over his shoulder.

22:08.756 --> 22:11.219
Yeah, he did in Earth and the Balance.

22:11.419 --> 22:19.449
And he's also just written a wonderful new introduction to yet another publication of Silent Spring in which he, yeah.

22:19.949 --> 22:21.411
I've got a first edition of that book.

22:21.728 --> 22:22.389
Do you?

22:22.409 --> 22:23.190
Good for you.

22:23.210 --> 22:27.015
I think it's, you know, one of the reasons I could do what I write about.

22:27.776 --> 22:28.998
Fashion for books.

22:29.018 --> 22:29.298
But that's it.

22:29.879 --> 22:33.724
You know, you talk about, you know, books that change things.

22:35.347 --> 22:39.192
Ian Fleming, you know, had a wonderful, had an extraordinary book collection.

22:39.212 --> 22:40.814
You know, the James Bond guy.

22:40.834 --> 22:44.199
And his collection was about books that made things happen.

22:45.120 --> 22:46.161
In any different way.

22:46.181 --> 22:49.266
It could be Baden-Powell and the Boy Scouts.

22:49.286 --> 22:49.626
It could be

22:50.062 --> 22:53.587
like Ava Curie on this, you know, or whatever.

22:53.748 --> 23:10.112
You know, you'd have to put, I mean, he died before this was published, I think, but certainly, of course, before the impact was fully assessed, but you'd have to certainly have influential books of the 20th century.

23:10.593 --> 23:12.516
No, I would.

23:13.017 --> 23:13.377
I would.

23:13.758 --> 23:19.326
I mean, I think she was the right person to write at the right time about

23:20.622 --> 23:23.707
a subject, and it wasn't just pesticides.

23:24.208 --> 23:25.870
Oh, an attitude.

23:25.890 --> 23:40.232
It was an attitude, and we needed a shift in perspective, and she just was able to articulate that shift that everybody could get it, even though some people were very unhappy about it.

23:40.373 --> 23:40.994
I mean, everything.

23:41.014 --> 23:45.220
The ozone stems, I think, from this awareness.

23:45.240 --> 23:46.482
Absolutely.

23:46.502 --> 23:49.026
And the fact that it's, you know, this place

23:49.799 --> 23:52.062
is small enough to destroy, isn't it?

23:52.243 --> 23:55.227
And things are irreparable, I think.

23:55.347 --> 23:55.748
Absolutely.

23:55.788 --> 23:57.230
We are all interconnected.

23:58.111 --> 24:03.659
Before Rachel, we somehow thought we lived separately.

24:04.581 --> 24:08.346
Somehow, you know, you could pollute and it wouldn't come back and bite you.

24:08.386 --> 24:13.113
Now you sort of can't imagine thinking that way.

24:13.834 --> 24:15.978
I understand you were interviewing an NPR?

24:17.380 --> 24:18.321
I've done...

24:19.567 --> 24:22.370
Living on Earth, the U.R.

24:22.450 --> 24:24.172
program, and I did Maine Public Radio.

24:25.033 --> 24:37.267
And are they generally interested in a commentary on Rachel and the influence of her work, or are they on the colloquy between the environmental and the HR?

24:37.287 --> 24:38.208
It depends.

24:38.228 --> 24:48.460
I think Living on Earth, the environmental program was... They asked about their relationship, too, but they wanted commentary.

24:48.743 --> 24:53.948
the environmental consciousness she brought to us and what we learned about Silent Spring in here.

24:54.709 --> 25:05.920
Other interviewers, their slant is just more on women of their era, the relationship, you know, so what was it?

25:07.261 --> 25:08.823
Oh, yeah.

25:08.903 --> 25:10.525
I mean, I haven't.

25:10.705 --> 25:12.046
I noticed you haven't, yeah.

25:13.167 --> 25:13.548
Whatever.

25:14.448 --> 25:17.271
So, I don't know.

25:17.291 --> 25:18.092
I guess I feel it's

25:19.338 --> 25:37.842
Everybody's bringing their own perspective and their own interests to bear on the book, and it's great for me that people of all different interests can find something that's enthralling to them about this story.

25:38.062 --> 25:40.786
Whatever it is, it's kind of amazing.

25:40.806 --> 25:41.907
Do you consider yourself a writer?

25:43.109 --> 25:44.150
Yeah.

25:44.170 --> 25:47.134
I mean, I went into the law because I love to write,

25:47.384 --> 25:58.199
And actually, in part because my grandmother told me, and I was interested in the law, but not much of the profession of the law, but I liked the law itself as a humanity.

25:58.940 --> 26:08.013
And I didn't know whether I really wanted to do law school, and my grandmother said, well, Rachel always said it was helpful to have something to write about, which I thought was good advice.

26:08.033 --> 26:16.885
So I've been, you know, I've written, my job with the legislature was to write a lot of law, and so I like that, and I,

26:17.978 --> 26:19.460
I write my journals.

26:19.500 --> 26:20.461
I write poetry.

26:22.043 --> 26:28.932
But I'm thinking more part of my midlife shift is to want to be able to try out more of my own writing.

26:28.952 --> 26:31.035
Do you like nonfiction?

26:31.055 --> 26:31.916
You mentioned poetry.

26:32.096 --> 26:32.437
Yeah.

26:33.618 --> 26:36.161
I like, probably I'll stick with nonfiction for a while.

26:36.281 --> 26:39.265
Maybe I'll wander off into fiction.

26:39.405 --> 26:41.909
Did it ever become tedious or boring for you?

26:41.929 --> 26:44.492
Or did you ever say, well, my God, what have I gotten myself into it?

26:45.299 --> 26:49.564
No, no, never, never to that extent.

26:50.144 --> 26:54.009
No, I mean, I loved, I loved, I just loved the story.

26:54.129 --> 26:58.353
I loved, I loved the writing.

26:58.373 --> 27:00.536
I loved my grandmother so much.

27:00.556 --> 27:04.660
And I came to love Rachel even more, to know her more and love her more.

27:04.680 --> 27:07.764
There were times when I thought I was drowning in paper.

27:07.784 --> 27:13.450
You know, I just couldn't believe, you know, the pile of notebooks to keep track of and then to keep track of

27:14.003 --> 27:41.935
the letters and then to keep track of the annotations and um i was i worried at times about whether i'd keep track of it all but i had wonderful people helping me organize that was a 12-year project yeah and at what point did you did you have a publisher uh faith in the early going it was it was faith and uh i mean just partly i knew this was going to be valuable to me if nobody else ever read these letters it sure was going to

27:42.320 --> 27:44.303
be a wonderful thing for me to do for my life.

27:45.164 --> 27:46.906
So I was happy to do it.

27:47.246 --> 27:50.331
And then I really hoped to be able to share it.

27:50.471 --> 28:01.205
And, you know, I had to work along getting it in shape and getting permission from the Carson Trust and stuff before I could really approach a publisher.

28:01.305 --> 28:03.548
So I had to work on that stuff.

28:03.688 --> 28:08.795
And this isn't for my piece, but I'm surprised that Houghton didn't publish it.

28:09.235 --> 28:10.437
Did you go to Houghton with it?

28:10.450 --> 28:14.814
Well, the way I found Beacon was with Paul Brooks' help.

28:15.555 --> 28:18.898
I'm delighted that I could write something about them.

28:18.918 --> 28:23.502
I haven't written them in years, and this pleases me.

28:23.542 --> 28:29.047
You know, I know no other publisher, but I can't imagine having done this with anybody but Beacon.

28:29.067 --> 28:31.189
They've been so supportive.

28:31.209 --> 28:31.529
Perfect book.

28:31.549 --> 28:32.310
Tasteful.

28:32.330 --> 28:38.095
I mean, their list is, you know, just kind of fits in with books.

28:38.294 --> 28:39.396
Yeah.

28:39.456 --> 28:46.586
They like women's issues and serious books, and they like to do good books, and they do them well.

28:46.687 --> 28:47.568
Yep, yep, they do.

28:48.289 --> 28:48.650
They do.

28:50.052 --> 28:58.665
So Paul, I think, touched base with Houghton, and then, I don't know whether it was Houghton or Paul who got in touch with Beacon.

28:58.945 --> 28:59.426
Great.

28:59.786 --> 29:02.490
Houghton's changed, and... Well, that's what Paul said.

29:02.510 --> 29:07.558
You know, he said, really, Beacon's kind of where Houghton was when Rachel was writing.

29:07.808 --> 29:08.929
I think that's true.

29:09.089 --> 29:17.298
When I was working, you know, I was working on a lot.

29:17.318 --> 29:28.831
It's, you know, I haven't questioned you about the substance of the letters.

29:28.951 --> 29:30.633
They speak for themselves.

29:31.594 --> 29:33.816
Pardon me, but I really do like the idea that

29:35.163 --> 29:37.927
There is continuity and there is story here, isn't there?

29:37.947 --> 29:38.307
There is.

29:38.908 --> 29:40.249
I really think there is.

29:40.270 --> 29:45.116
What do you think, what do you hope the reader comes away with?

29:45.136 --> 29:50.202
I mean, obviously, there would be no book if there wasn't a Rachel.

29:50.222 --> 30:01.737
I mean, even if the letters were the letters and these two wonderfully sensitive and articulate women were corresponding, as wonderful as they are, you still have to have a Rachel to justify their publication.

30:01.777 --> 30:02.778
Exactly right.

30:02.798 --> 30:03.699
Yeah.

30:03.719 --> 30:05.001
And so I hope...

30:05.504 --> 30:16.817
In that respect, I really hope that readers will get to know Rachel in many more dimensions.

30:17.478 --> 30:33.857
And for me, part of what she was doing in these letters was working out her heart, which I think is part of the genius of her other published writings, is that Rachel understood

30:34.951 --> 30:59.929
nature and biology not just with her intellect she really understood it with her heart she felt what it was like to be those little creatures who lived in her tide pools and she loved them and i think she was she was expressing that and working on that expression in these letters and that that is the power behind her scientific writing that's why silent spring

31:00.567 --> 31:27.773
impacted us the way it did i think was because it wasn't just dry science it was powered by this woman's heart oh it's a it's a literary work yeah exactly right it goes it has that extra element yeah so uh which which does distinguish it yeah it's not enough to be important and significant no but it really does it moves you it has patterns yeah

31:28.208 --> 31:28.709
It does.

31:28.729 --> 31:29.249
In its own way.

31:29.369 --> 31:29.690
It does.

31:29.890 --> 31:31.472
There's passion and there's power.

31:31.492 --> 31:31.692
Yep.

31:32.513 --> 31:34.695
And resonance is all critics' words.

31:34.755 --> 31:34.976
Right.

31:35.116 --> 31:36.357
Well, they're the right words.

31:37.298 --> 31:37.759
It's true.

31:38.199 --> 31:46.989
In the end, to move people, if you just move their heads, you're not going to move them where we need to go to really make shifts.

31:47.009 --> 31:50.393
And she was able to talk to us on another level, too.

31:50.453 --> 31:53.676
And I think she was working that out a little bit in this.

31:54.217 --> 31:57.000
And I also hope that people just reflect on

31:59.107 --> 32:06.902
sort of friendship, I mean, however you want to define that, whatever that means in your life, just sort of broadly, the importance of friendship.

32:08.806 --> 32:21.891
And I certainly have reflected a lot on, you know, how much time I choose to invest in my life in caring for others and accepting others' caring into my life.

32:22.917 --> 32:26.901
as opposed to how much time and attention I put on going to work.

32:27.462 --> 32:31.966
One of the sad ironies of it all is how lonely she was at the end.

32:32.627 --> 32:33.067
Yeah, yeah.

32:33.648 --> 32:42.497
If you could change history just a tad, give her a quarter of a turn, what would you have hoped to have done?

32:42.517 --> 32:48.003
I mean, maybe allow them greater proximity to one another, I guess, would be.

32:48.023 --> 32:48.283
I don't know.

32:48.955 --> 32:50.477
Yeah, I don't know.

32:50.497 --> 33:06.261
I guess if I could have changed history a little bit, I would have hoped for Rachel that maybe she wouldn't have taken on as single-handedly as she did some of the trials and tribulations of her family.

33:08.104 --> 33:17.258
That she might have found a little more space for her own personal life and the energy she had for personal relationships.

33:18.115 --> 33:20.558
was largely devoted to her family.

33:21.960 --> 33:28.789
And I think her relationship with my grandmother fit into that because it was primarily in letters.

33:29.229 --> 33:34.236
My parents and I figured out that in the 12 years they knew each other, they probably were in each other's presence for less than two years.

33:35.537 --> 33:42.446
And I think that worked for Rachel because she could choose to have this relationship when she had the time.

33:43.207 --> 33:47.953
She could write after midnight as opposed to if people are...

33:48.203 --> 33:54.790
right up against you, well, you gotta, when they say they need you, maybe you gotta give them the time.

33:54.810 --> 34:01.497
So you think it was decidedly a relationship that was bonded by correspondence?

34:01.517 --> 34:07.043
That maybe it wouldn't have been the same had there been a closer partner?

34:07.063 --> 34:09.866
Yeah, I'm not sure, you know, but I think, yeah, who can say?

34:09.886 --> 34:10.747
It's one of the mysteries.

34:11.648 --> 34:16.033
But for sure, because of

34:16.992 --> 34:21.059
either their choice or circumstances foisted it upon them.

34:23.864 --> 34:27.471
The correspondence was the namesake of their relationship.

34:27.491 --> 34:36.066
Do you think because they spent such relatively little time together, do you think it was idealized to any extent?

34:36.086 --> 34:39.031
Do you think it was something that it wasn't?

34:39.051 --> 34:40.654
Something that really existed?

34:42.625 --> 34:45.849
Yeah, I think it probably was.

34:46.110 --> 34:56.384
They got to dwell on the happier parts of relationship more than those of us who have to take out the garbage with each other and stuff, maybe.

34:56.424 --> 35:02.592
You know, they got to smooth over those rough spots maybe a little more easily.

35:04.411 --> 35:07.815
when you're really just living and slogging through daily life with somebody.

35:07.835 --> 35:11.439
She didn't look to your grandmother for criticism so much in her work.

35:11.700 --> 35:14.723
Now, that's one difference in seeing Bishop's work.

35:15.744 --> 35:23.573
She's the professional writer here, corresponding with other professional writers, and she says, if you can't take this, I'm not going to write to you.

35:23.994 --> 35:25.316
I want to tell you this stinks.

35:25.336 --> 35:27.458
She doesn't quite say it like that.

35:28.059 --> 35:34.266
She wants the same kind of, I hate the word feedback, but she wants the same response.

35:34.685 --> 35:54.550
no i got the sense she looked at my grandmother in that sense more for just my grandmother's ear you know not her uh not real literary criticism in any sense but does this hold your interest as a reader that's all i want to know what they did with my book incidentally they hired a woman they called a cold reader

35:55.289 --> 35:58.112
just to read a book out of the woodwork.

35:58.132 --> 35:59.714
Oh, man, I would love a job like that.

35:59.834 --> 36:02.316
And my agent said, gee, that's great.

36:02.336 --> 36:03.798
And I said, she loved it.

36:03.838 --> 36:04.819
She loved it.

36:04.919 --> 36:05.940
It was great.

36:06.321 --> 36:08.483
But, you know, that's kind of what you're saying.

36:09.464 --> 36:10.124
How does this play?

36:10.185 --> 36:11.025
Or am I boring you?

36:11.045 --> 36:11.706
Am I boring you?

36:12.066 --> 36:13.828
Is this becoming tedious?

36:13.908 --> 36:15.090
Is it not significant?

36:15.110 --> 36:21.276
You know, and Rachel says at one point in here that that's a role her mother used to play for her.

36:21.296 --> 36:22.157
But her mother was

36:22.694 --> 36:47.183
aging and failing and i think it's just sort of something my grandmother that's one piece that my grandmother was able to kind of fill in rachel's life i i sense also that it's a symbiotic relationship it's not one way in any direction no i think they do feed each other yep yeah no i think they do i think rachel did many things for my grandmother

36:47.635 --> 36:52.721
My grandmother had always cared about writing and, you know, I've got her attempts at essays and stories.

36:52.741 --> 36:53.501
And she was encouraged.

36:53.982 --> 36:55.023
And she was encouraged.

36:55.063 --> 36:55.624
By Rachel.

36:55.984 --> 36:56.184
Yep.

36:56.385 --> 37:03.072
And yet I don't think she was ever going to have perhaps the skill or the discipline or, you know, the single-mindedness to do that.

37:03.212 --> 37:07.437
And so my grandmother kind of got to have her, her literary form became the letter.

37:07.777 --> 37:09.239
So she got her audience.

37:10.600 --> 37:16.967
And then my grandmother certainly was passionate long before she knew Rachel about nature.

37:17.200 --> 37:25.449
And she got to be a teacher of her knowledge of nature a little bit to Rachel, just if only Southport.

37:26.249 --> 37:29.092
And what were the circumstances of their meeting again?

37:29.333 --> 37:44.669
Just that Rachel, my grandmother, had read in the local Southport newspaper that Rachel was building a cottage five minutes away from our cottage, so she wrote a welcoming note when they met that summer.

37:44.689 --> 37:44.929
Karma.

37:45.095 --> 37:46.797
Karma, yeah, all that they shared.

37:47.038 --> 37:48.339
Kindred spirits.

37:50.862 --> 37:52.565
Well, can I ask you, have I missed anything?

37:52.645 --> 37:53.266
What would you like?

37:55.569 --> 37:58.132
Let me just say, by the way, it's in Greensburg, Pennsylvania.

37:58.612 --> 38:03.118
When I pitched it, they said, oh, I'm dying to get a piece on this, because, you know.

38:03.158 --> 38:05.121
She's from around there, yeah.

38:05.381 --> 38:05.862
Yeah, yeah.

38:05.882 --> 38:07.284
Please, can I have it by April 9th?

38:07.404 --> 38:09.967
I mean, I don't know why that's, because she wants to run it by the 16th.

38:09.987 --> 38:13.752
I don't know what's going on, whether it's Earth Day on the 22nd or something, but.

38:13.951 --> 38:17.074
She really wanted it, wants it by the night.

38:18.035 --> 38:19.757
That's why I moved you ahead of a number of others.

38:20.038 --> 38:22.901
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

38:23.862 --> 38:25.023
You know, I can't think of anything.

38:25.063 --> 38:26.024
You're a good interviewer.

38:27.045 --> 38:28.407
I've covered it.

38:30.389 --> 38:32.732
I think you have.

38:32.752 --> 38:34.614
Yeah, I mean, my job is to read the book.

38:34.654 --> 38:40.841
My job is to read the book, and to ask you to do my work for me.

38:40.901 --> 38:41.241
Yeah.

38:41.845 --> 38:48.055
No, I guess my hope is that people do open the cover.

38:48.135 --> 38:53.304
And I feel that if they will open the cover and just start reading, they'll get carried along.

38:53.384 --> 38:57.010
So you must have a great feeling of satisfaction.

38:57.030 --> 38:57.631
Yeah, I do.

38:58.893 --> 39:00.355
I do.

39:00.776 --> 39:03.761
It's also kind of an out-of-body experience.

39:03.781 --> 39:08.629
It's a little hard to process while it's happening because I lived alone with it.

39:08.896 --> 39:11.921
for so long and I knew it really meant a lot to me.

39:12.101 --> 39:12.942
You never despaired.

39:13.483 --> 39:14.084
No, I didn't.

39:14.124 --> 39:15.085
You knew it would be finished.

39:16.027 --> 39:17.429
I knew I would finish it.

39:17.809 --> 39:21.615
I wondered how the heck old am I going to be when I finish this.

39:21.715 --> 39:35.396
But I did wonder if... I trusted in my feelings about it that it really was important for me and that I would be able to tell the story to friends and family and that it wouldn't be meaningful for them.

39:35.416 --> 39:37.519
But I didn't know if it would be beyond

39:37.752 --> 40:01.448
my circle and uh you know to have diane or me my editor um call and have her say wow i mean that was an incredible experience but it wasn't just me it wasn't just in my head and heart but it was something to touch everybody so just if you could give me the numbers how many letters are there all together and and

40:01.681 --> 40:27.385
yeah um saved in the collection in the collection that i have is about 750 and there are about 500 of them yeah yeah and i really think dm was a great help we really wanted i very much wanted to hit every subject everything that's in that course there's nothing i wanted to leave out that's great yeah so with 500 we were able to get it all in

40:27.871 --> 40:30.734
And what was the first printing deal off then?

40:30.754 --> 40:32.055
I think $25,000.

40:32.076 --> 40:32.556
Really?

40:32.736 --> 40:33.077
Do you think?

40:33.337 --> 40:34.939
That's terrific.

40:34.959 --> 40:36.260
It's getting wonderful.

40:37.301 --> 40:37.682
Buds.

40:38.723 --> 40:40.665
Oh yeah, that's good to hear from you.

40:40.905 --> 40:43.648
I've had a good review of the New York Times.

40:44.148 --> 40:46.010
I've had a good review of her, too.

40:46.611 --> 40:47.052
They did.

40:47.212 --> 40:50.295
I mean, darn, I mean, she was like a main guy.

40:50.836 --> 40:53.338
Yeah, so she can really get that.

40:53.579 --> 40:57.743
She's a major, major figure.

40:58.077 --> 40:59.038
Yeah.

40:59.058 --> 41:00.600
And they did it right on time.

41:00.800 --> 41:02.322
They did do it right on time.

41:02.342 --> 41:04.545
I think you watched them posting it.

41:04.765 --> 41:07.328
You know, I've heard that and I didn't know that.

41:08.189 --> 41:08.830
I didn't know that.

41:09.210 --> 41:10.933
I was trying to get it accurate.

41:10.953 --> 41:11.573
I didn't know that.

41:12.995 --> 41:13.075
Wow.

41:13.095 --> 41:13.716
You're excited.

41:14.036 --> 41:22.346
I am excited and I can take, you know, I can just, in a way, I can be completely thrilled and proud and everything because it's their writing.

41:22.366 --> 41:23.968
You know, and I'm happy to be a midwife.

41:25.510 --> 41:27.072
But I'm just

41:27.608 --> 41:34.259
I am so thrilled that other people are... I was right, there is something in this for other people to enjoy.

41:35.681 --> 41:38.125
Rachel was, would you describe her as a crusader?

41:39.086 --> 41:40.809
She wasn't a crusader per se, was she?

41:41.049 --> 41:41.891
You know, that's interesting.

41:41.911 --> 41:47.039
I mean, she wasn't a Margaret Sanger or something, you know, who risked her in jail?

41:47.540 --> 41:47.880
No.

41:47.900 --> 41:49.703
And the rest and stuff like that.

41:49.864 --> 41:51.426
No, she wasn't a crusader.

41:51.446 --> 41:52.908
What would the word be for her?

41:53.269 --> 41:54.932
I mean, she sure was dedicated.

41:54.952 --> 41:55.152
Yeah.

41:55.722 --> 42:00.970
to the environment, and she sure was certain of her perspective on it.

42:03.374 --> 42:09.063
But Crusader doesn't sound sort of patient and quiet and deliberate enough.

42:11.246 --> 42:20.481
Rachel was sort of, she was in it all for the long haul and the quiet build-up, just kind of overwhelming you with...

42:22.469 --> 42:51.852
the strength of her convictions i think and the strength of her argument she really wanted to persuade you she didn't want to force you into something she wanted to persuade you as a woman is she ahead of her time yeah and more so you know i always thought of her as a public figure who was a bit ahead of her times as a woman writing about the subjects she was writing about but now when i read of her family life i think you know most women in the early 50s and she started in the 30s aren't the people who

42:52.388 --> 42:56.993
at that time are the caretakers and breadwinners for a household.

42:59.516 --> 43:20.218
Lots of women my age are doing that now, but at her time, there she is sitting there doing her taxes, contemplating her financial situation, taking care of her mother's health problems, administering medication, trying to understand a five-year-old boy, trying to write about

43:20.654 --> 43:42.848
all this scientific stuff deal with her agents deal with her publishers you know that sounds like a very modern woman so i think she was kind of pioneering in that way i'm not sure she knew it she probably just thought her family was kind of strange i can't think of anything else do you have a phone number where i can reach you yeah two let me give you
