WEBVTT

00:02.393 --> 00:27.152
A woman...

00:27.301 --> 00:53.241
doing you know this book about this man's man so to speak a boy's book you mean as my husband always called it it's so nice that you've written a boy's book um 65 different reasons look i mean different reasons in the beginning from in the end um you know the real genesis was rereading windstand and stars and realizing a really fine piece of writing i mean five pieces of writing

00:53.423 --> 00:55.188
and that we didn't know anything about Sandex.

00:55.288 --> 00:57.092
So it was like this, you know, J.M.

00:57.373 --> 01:02.085
Barrie or Agatha Christie kind of figure where we still read the work, but they're related a little about the writer.

01:02.747 --> 01:09.745
And then realizing that in terms of a biography,

01:09.910 --> 01:11.992
filled with contradictions.

01:12.012 --> 01:14.875
And that was what fascinates me in general, I suppose, in a book and in a life.

01:14.915 --> 01:16.737
And that's what really fascinated me with him.

01:16.757 --> 01:20.842
You've got a sort of technology-hating aviator.

01:20.862 --> 01:23.425
You've got a writer who hates intellectuals.

01:23.445 --> 01:27.409
You have an aristocrat who, in so many ways, tries to be a man of the people.

01:27.429 --> 01:31.493
You've got all these wonderful little sort of crinkles in the life, crinkles in the life.

01:31.834 --> 01:32.975
And so that got me, though.

01:33.315 --> 01:35.918
And then finding out that it was just, you know those great

01:36.353 --> 01:39.057
That Penofsky definition of human has two connotations.

01:39.077 --> 01:43.405
It can mean, you know, two errors to human, and it can mean making mistakes and being weak.

01:43.425 --> 01:48.733
And then human in the sense of, as opposed to the animal kingdom, human as in glorious and heroic and blah, blah, blah.

01:48.753 --> 01:52.800
And it was a life that went in both of those directions at the same time.

01:53.321 --> 01:57.648
So I just got really hooked on the whole contrast between the two worlds.

01:57.668 --> 02:00.373
That was sort of the initial starting point.

02:00.753 --> 02:01.855
It's 1989.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.906
I'm at SNS at this point.

02:05.087 --> 02:07.090
The first reaction is what every publisher would do.

02:07.270 --> 02:13.320
I went to, you know, the first two biographers, like I think I thought it would be appropriate, and said, wouldn't you like to write a book about Sandex for me?

02:13.340 --> 02:13.961
I will publish it.

02:13.981 --> 02:15.723
Both of them said, this is me.

02:16.244 --> 02:17.066
This is me speaking.

02:17.967 --> 02:25.940
So I said, they said, fine, but call me in, you know, 2013 when I'm done with, you know, Collette, whoever they were doing at the time.

02:25.960 --> 02:28.243
So this is a book you wanted as an editor.

02:28.263 --> 02:28.804
Essentially, yeah.

02:28.824 --> 02:29.445
But, yeah.

02:29.594 --> 02:36.644
I mean, it's interesting because the whole transition from editing to writing a biography was extremely easy.

02:36.704 --> 02:44.416
So anyway, the more I read, just basically to tempt the next person, the more I realized I'd always secretly wanted to write a book about France.

02:44.576 --> 02:51.827
In many ways, Sandex's life, because it is always going at cross-current with France, was a cheap way to write about France.

02:51.847 --> 02:53.089
I wouldn't say cheap.

02:53.109 --> 02:55.913
But it was a sort of easy way to write about France.

02:55.933 --> 02:57.475
So...

02:57.640 --> 03:08.457
I took the plunge, my husband pushed me to take the plunge that your wife took you, pushed you to make, and quit my job and wrote a proposal and sold it.

03:09.098 --> 03:11.321
And you sold it before you left the job?

03:11.341 --> 03:12.463
I sold it after I left the job.

03:12.483 --> 03:13.905
I didn't tell anybody what I was doing.

03:14.526 --> 03:20.054
And I went off to Montreal, which is like the best collection of... Do you like some coffee?

03:20.094 --> 03:22.839
Yes, coffee would be great, actually.

03:22.979 --> 03:23.800
Some coffee?

03:24.134 --> 03:25.137
I'll give you the section.

03:26.941 --> 03:32.436
The first selection of French and English editions.

03:32.456 --> 03:39.915
It's fabulous to start the book, because they think of... In France, Saint-Exup's reputation, as you can tell from the book, has just taken a plunge.

03:39.895 --> 03:43.560
They don't have the French bias, they don't have the French sophistication toward literature.

03:43.881 --> 03:46.765
So they still think of him as this god of French literature.

03:46.785 --> 03:50.290
It was incredibly easy to do the research there.

03:50.330 --> 03:56.138
He made only one visit to Montreal, but all the press for that visit was easily found and all the books were there.

03:56.158 --> 04:00.064
So it was a kind of convenient place to be holed up, not telling anyone what I was doing and starting the book.

04:00.415 --> 04:07.309
This is absolutely off the record, but the reason I did it was that I was afraid to say to my old authors, oh, I'm thinking of writing a book.

04:08.110 --> 04:09.834
Quick way to end a friendship.

04:09.914 --> 04:13.140
So they didn't tell me what I was doing until the proposal went out on submission.

04:13.260 --> 04:17.108
So that's basically where it started.

04:17.881 --> 04:21.206
When you did the proposal, how much work was it?

04:21.707 --> 04:24.091
Enough to sustain the proposal?

04:24.111 --> 04:28.778
I had already done about three months research, and I probably did about three more for the proposal.

04:28.798 --> 04:33.646
I mean, of course, now if I look back at the proposal, so much of what I said is either facile or wrong.

04:34.087 --> 04:41.258
You know, and so much of what gets you intrigued is not what... No bearing to the book.

04:41.479 --> 04:43.602
The big stories of my book...

04:43.868 --> 04:55.246
I had no idea how fascinating it was going to be.

04:55.386 --> 05:04.441
One of the most interesting things for me writing the film and thinking about when I was thinking about writing was the context between the work and the actual literature.

05:04.461 --> 05:08.948
Because so much of what's in the work is autobiographical, but

05:09.316 --> 05:14.321
And more so than any other writer who actually writes about what happens to him in a thoroughly honest turn.

05:14.742 --> 05:16.884
And so Danny talked about the crash and the delgating.

05:16.924 --> 05:20.327
This is how it happened, and this is what came out of it, and this is what happened afterwards.

05:20.768 --> 05:21.448
It was great fun.

05:21.468 --> 05:24.852
And I had no idea going in that there was going to be that much correlation.

05:24.872 --> 05:27.475
I had no idea how truthful he was being on the page.

05:27.495 --> 05:32.700
That there would be that much correlation between the back story, so to speak, and his accounts of it.

05:32.720 --> 05:34.161
And it would be that funny.

05:34.181 --> 05:35.903
I had no idea how funny he was.

05:36.964 --> 05:38.766
Which was definitely one of the things that...

05:39.016 --> 05:43.864
kept me going.

05:43.964 --> 05:48.612
I don't mind my jumping around.

05:49.273 --> 05:51.877
Do you think he killed himself?

05:52.438 --> 05:58.789
I think he didn't want to go on living, but that's different than killing yourself.

05:58.809 --> 06:05.800
I think it's true that any one of those last missions could have been the last by the time he's ready for it to be the last.

06:06.050 --> 06:11.036
But I think that's almost entirely... He knew he was flying a plane that he didn't know how to fly.

06:11.117 --> 06:12.258
And he couldn't turn.

06:12.278 --> 06:21.730
I mean, he couldn't... At that point, he didn't even have the physical strength to be kind of looking behind him, seeing if there was anyone following him, concentrating on all his controls and monitoring the oxygen supply.

06:22.511 --> 06:28.158
So I don't think... I don't think he ever went up without thinking, as many of the pilots at that point did.

06:29.040 --> 06:30.341
This could be my very last mission.

06:30.361 --> 06:33.305
And that's why his life is so much in order for after the war.

06:33.585 --> 06:35.668
The last letters, as much as they're filled with

06:35.918 --> 06:37.922
You know, if I die, I'll regret nothing.

06:37.983 --> 06:40.047
And, you know, if I die, keep doing this with my papers.

06:40.147 --> 06:43.034
They're also filled with, I really want to finish my book.

06:43.294 --> 06:45.359
I mean, there's a certain link to the future.

06:45.399 --> 06:53.357
Not often, but there's an occasional glimmer of me thinking, everything that happens after the war will be ugly, but I expect to be there to experience it.

06:53.437 --> 06:54.479
I don't think he killed himself.

06:54.519 --> 06:55.682
I mean, he was definitely...

06:55.831 --> 06:57.913
Not just of the war, but of the world.

06:58.254 --> 07:02.899
And didn't have any... The fact that the war was ending was only half an end to his battles.

07:03.159 --> 07:04.301
His battles were just beginning.

07:04.341 --> 07:07.644
He could see the problems of technology, and he hated the modern world.

07:07.665 --> 07:09.987
You mentioned that your husband was a pilot?

07:10.007 --> 07:11.769
My husband was a pilot.

07:11.789 --> 07:15.153
There was a big... What is his pilot?

07:15.253 --> 07:16.815
Just a little place.

07:16.875 --> 07:19.058
You've been very good here the last year.

07:19.338 --> 07:22.521
Did you do that yet or not?

07:22.542 --> 07:23.863
I'll try and do a little mask on.

07:24.670 --> 07:33.301
He's also quite tall.

07:33.361 --> 07:44.815
He's also, although he hate my saying it, occasionally absent-minded.

07:44.855 --> 07:47.379
He's also a friend from the aristocratic family.

07:47.399 --> 07:51.724
There are definitely certain parallels there, which helps in terms of

07:52.042 --> 07:53.965
I think in terms of the fascination on my part.

07:53.985 --> 07:58.451
These were things with which I was in some way involved to begin with.

07:59.292 --> 08:02.696
And it was, you know, social living with someone who's fascinated by your work.

08:02.757 --> 08:09.005
It would have been harder to have written a biography of, you know, Virginia Woolf and have had him that interested in what I was doing.

08:09.626 --> 08:14.192
But I don't know how much it accounts to get written about it.

08:14.212 --> 08:16.395
Was he as interested in...

08:16.679 --> 08:19.162
No, no.

08:19.883 --> 08:35.724
She still comes to that French bias that Sandex is a, you know, sort of second-rate writer, an adolescent association, not somebody in the canon, basically.

08:35.884 --> 08:39.649
That was not all that well known.

08:40.827 --> 08:47.498
But he was a great person, right?

08:47.539 --> 09:04.708
Well, you know, the operative quote for me was that I've actually got one in the book about the friend who says, when the flying is dangerous, he's brilliant, and when the flying is boring, he's dangerous.

09:06.140 --> 09:09.963
So did you kind of go in with a totally open mind?

09:09.983 --> 09:13.466
How much did you know about it?

09:14.107 --> 09:18.711
I knew the facts, basically.

09:18.731 --> 09:23.355
No one had ever done most of the research outside the obvious channels.

09:23.375 --> 09:24.936
So there were huge gaps.

09:24.956 --> 09:27.278
You know, the love wave was thoroughly unexplored.

09:27.318 --> 09:29.440
No one had ever looked in the American archives.

09:29.800 --> 09:30.821
It spends all this time in America.

09:30.901 --> 09:33.063
No one's ever looked in the American archives.

09:33.083 --> 09:35.505
Both of the crashes of the 30s, which

09:35.941 --> 09:39.004
which affect him so deeply, were completely undocumented.

09:39.324 --> 09:44.830
There were a big few things I knew nothing about, because none of the early biographers had known anything about.

09:45.130 --> 10:01.746
The earlier biographers were all of them hindered by either the fact that they were in France, or the fact that the wife was alive, the mistress was not only alive, but tormenting them, and these big margins of stuff were left there to be found.

10:02.131 --> 10:05.396
Um, the American army officers fly with him at the end of his life.

10:05.456 --> 10:06.958
No one had talked to him.

10:06.978 --> 10:07.879
There's huge gaps.

10:08.420 --> 10:09.662
I can't tell my opinion.

10:09.682 --> 10:11.865
You were running out of time, too, actually, weren't you?

10:11.885 --> 10:15.050
Yes, I was, I was rather, um, I must say, was my deadline, weren't you?

10:15.771 --> 10:19.276
No, I mean in terms of getting angry with the people who were still alive.

10:19.296 --> 10:20.397
Oh, I started with all the old people.

10:20.417 --> 10:25.044
I mean, I know it's a sort of demo thing to say, but you just think if anyone dies in the afternoon or something.

10:25.304 --> 10:27.868
Um, I have five people in my book over here.

10:27.848 --> 10:33.277
Elliot Roosevelt was the only one who had the ill-grace.

10:33.397 --> 10:37.344
One of them died at the age of 99.

10:37.364 --> 10:38.425
They all died.

10:38.445 --> 10:40.308
I worked mindfully after them.

10:40.769 --> 10:42.352
They're not going to be around.

10:42.472 --> 10:51.747
There was a definite sense, and this is true, the new subject too, which we'll talk about later, a definite sense that this is the last moment at which you could write the book and still have the eyewitnesses.

10:51.946 --> 10:56.951
In this case, many of the women, because they were younger, and in many of the pilots, because they were younger, survived things.

10:57.431 --> 11:05.118
And at the same time, get the people you and I mentioned earlier who are desperate to talk because they realize they've reached the end of their lives, and they're now ready to open up.

11:05.178 --> 11:07.020
And they didn't talk to anyone earlier.

11:07.280 --> 11:08.422
Fabulous.

11:08.482 --> 11:09.222
Fabulous stuff.

11:10.023 --> 11:14.027
And the one person, sorry, the one person who, yes, I'll give you a great example.

11:14.267 --> 11:20.653
The one person who so much broke my heart was Sylvia Reinhardt, the mistress, the girlfriend who, at his home, he read The Little Prince.

11:21.022 --> 11:22.470
died this summer.

11:22.691 --> 11:28.905
Did you have this tear where she was the one person whose hands I've wanted to deliver the book?

11:29.071 --> 11:43.492
I'm sorry, what did you want, like an example of people?

11:43.512 --> 11:45.034
Yeah, exactly.

11:45.074 --> 11:48.038
What was one of the really great surprises?

11:48.058 --> 11:49.981
I mean, you can't believe what you're hearing.

11:50.922 --> 11:52.805
A sort of trivial one, but fun for me.

11:53.486 --> 11:56.130
Not entirely trivial.

11:56.290 --> 11:57.171
He always sings.

11:57.421 --> 12:03.670
And everyone, half the people would say, he sang, in French you say, comme un casserole, like a cow.

12:03.870 --> 12:05.092
He sang really offbeat.

12:05.112 --> 12:06.554
Do it slowly in the French.

12:06.634 --> 12:09.198
And comme un casserole, like casserole.

12:09.598 --> 12:12.763
And half the people would say he sang beautifully.

12:12.783 --> 12:18.852
The French mistress, who considers herself the expert on him, he sang beautifully and no one ever appreciated it.

12:18.872 --> 12:20.915
So, you know, I never really thought about this.

12:21.455 --> 12:26.162
And then one day, one day I found out there was a letter, two letters,

12:26.530 --> 12:27.573
From St.

12:27.593 --> 12:30.442
X, two women named Hedda Stern in Washington.

12:30.462 --> 12:31.325
And I thought, well, that's lovely.

12:31.345 --> 12:32.528
I've never heard of Hedda Stern.

12:32.649 --> 12:34.875
I'll, you know, find those in due course.

12:34.935 --> 12:36.380
And, you know, three years went by.

12:36.400 --> 12:36.962
I got to Paris.

12:36.982 --> 12:37.624
I got to Burgo.

12:37.664 --> 12:39.409
I got everywhere, but I never got to Washington.

12:39.642 --> 12:41.406
I went to this and found out all these letters.

12:41.426 --> 12:49.444
There are these amazingly intimate letters about how depressed she was and how she saved her life.

12:50.446 --> 12:51.929
Beautiful, beautiful letters.

12:51.949 --> 12:54.134
I'd write you more often, but I hate myself.

12:54.515 --> 12:55.898
I'm so depressed.

12:55.938 --> 12:57.381
You saved my life last night.

12:57.631 --> 12:59.353
Who is this woman?

12:59.753 --> 13:00.334
I went home.

13:00.354 --> 13:01.235
Did you copy the letters?

13:01.255 --> 13:02.236
I let me copy the letters.

13:02.497 --> 13:03.878
Beautifully read Little Prince's.

13:03.898 --> 13:05.540
You know, I could tell when they were from.

13:05.580 --> 13:07.623
He never dated his male.

13:07.643 --> 13:10.426
But you could tell by the drawings often when they were written.

13:10.446 --> 13:14.951
So these were clearly post Little Prince, post having written a Little Prince.

13:15.131 --> 13:16.513
So it took late 42, early 43.

13:17.534 --> 13:20.498
I went home, three three nights coming to sleep.

13:20.518 --> 13:20.898
Who is this woman?

13:20.918 --> 13:21.839
How come I've never heard of her?

13:21.859 --> 13:23.301
How come I left this till the last minute?

13:23.467 --> 13:28.133
And then I said, and you're like, just because you give your archives to this Smithsonian does not mean that you are dead.

13:28.894 --> 13:31.418
She turns out to live about five blocks from here in New York.

13:31.438 --> 13:34.462
She's Mr. Saul Steinberg, the artist.

13:34.482 --> 13:34.762
Wow.

13:35.263 --> 13:47.659
And no one had ever come to her before and said, what about... There was a fairly well-researched book in 1970, but since I know they had ever come to her.

13:47.719 --> 13:48.700
Yeah, it's been a while.

13:48.841 --> 13:49.221
Anyway...

13:49.538 --> 13:50.760
Well, was she ready to tag?

13:50.840 --> 13:52.442
I mean, this man, she'd come to America.

13:52.742 --> 13:54.384
They'd been introduced to her art.

13:54.404 --> 13:57.529
She's a fairly young woman, I would think.

13:57.549 --> 13:59.071
She was in her 20s and the 40s.

13:59.091 --> 13:59.191
Sure.

13:59.631 --> 14:02.215
Anyway, someone introduces her to Santa.

14:02.355 --> 14:04.097
They make a tremendous impression on each other.

14:04.117 --> 14:04.678
They're just strange.

14:05.499 --> 14:08.323
But her memories of her, she's an artist.

14:08.776 --> 14:12.543
fabulous, fabulous mind, and a perfectly vivid memory.

14:12.623 --> 14:19.676
And the impressions that this man made upon her, heartbroken, lost in New York, in the middle of writing Citadel, which is the book you lose time.

14:20.177 --> 14:23.424
And she was a kid, but a brilliant, incredibly cultured kid.

14:24.065 --> 14:26.329
And she just, you know, she saw everything.

14:26.489 --> 14:29.856
So she had this just flowing, flowing, flowing, fabulous description of him.

14:29.876 --> 14:31.138
It's amazing that she had

14:32.215 --> 14:34.862
to give this tape to the Smithsonian.

14:35.484 --> 14:36.407
Before her death, yes.

14:36.427 --> 14:38.051
You love people like that.

14:38.071 --> 14:41.641
Anyway, the one thing she hadn't given to the Smithsonian was a tape of him singing.

14:42.203 --> 14:42.343
Uh-huh.

14:42.475 --> 14:48.562
So there we have it, there's four years after I started the project, someone finally says to me, oh, and I have this tape, I don't remember what's on it.

14:48.582 --> 14:52.967
You know, that feeling you get when someone says it to you, and you're just rushing home on a cold sweat.

14:53.467 --> 14:57.732
And he's sitting around in tears hearing him sing.

14:57.752 --> 15:05.040
He sings this wonderful old Quebec country tune, you know, voilà le Beauvoir, just, you know, it's exciting.

15:05.060 --> 15:06.321
So that kind of thing.

15:06.421 --> 15:08.303
I mean, you know, it's like you just have that chivalry.

15:08.824 --> 15:10.366
How long were you an editor?

15:10.486 --> 15:11.087
How long were you an editor?

15:11.107 --> 15:12.448
How long were you an editor?

15:13.390 --> 15:17.255
I started in 82, and I left in 89.

15:17.595 --> 15:19.658
Just tell me a little bit about your background.

15:19.678 --> 15:24.704
I started at Viking Penguin, basically.

15:25.325 --> 15:26.506
You're from Massachusetts.

15:26.647 --> 15:27.488
I'm from the Berkshire.

15:28.169 --> 15:30.011
Are you actually going up to North Adams?

15:30.091 --> 15:31.012
I'm actually not going up.

15:31.052 --> 15:38.862
My poor newlywed mother, for whom I had come, I called her and said, Mom, she's very funny that I'm not coming with you.

15:38.962 --> 15:41.305
It started at HarperCollins for a year, Harper and Ralph.

15:41.572 --> 15:47.179
Um, then went to Viking for about four or five years, then went to Viking for about four or five years.

15:47.199 --> 15:50.363
Yes, I had it wrong after a bad gossip she got.

15:50.403 --> 15:59.495
Um, we went to some of them just after that, and then let's move.

15:59.756 --> 16:07.546
My degree was in Art History and Philosophy.

16:08.026 --> 16:08.848
I had no idea.

16:09.669 --> 16:10.009
I mean,

16:10.310 --> 16:12.953
And when did you graduate?

16:12.973 --> 16:13.173
82.

16:13.193 --> 16:15.976
82, yeah.

16:16.116 --> 16:17.978
I had always had summer jobs in publishing.

16:17.998 --> 16:21.762
You know, you have that attraction to books and you just can't quite take it.

16:22.563 --> 16:26.948
And I just by accident found what seemed to be an extremely good job in publishing before I graduated.

16:26.968 --> 16:30.912
So I took it thinking this will save me the trouble of having to think about what I do next.

16:31.473 --> 16:34.476
And you know, you get instantly hooked if you haven't already been hooked.

16:34.816 --> 16:35.457
So, no.

16:35.673 --> 16:48.191
This came to me when I was thinking about the next book.

16:48.211 --> 16:53.539
The first time it's like, I think, I've only been read it once, The First Marriage, where you just throw yourself into it.

16:53.559 --> 16:54.400
You think, I can do this.

16:54.901 --> 16:59.588
The second time, you know what the pitfalls are like, you know about those sleepless nights, you know about the setbacks.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.869
They just think, why would anyone want to do this again?

17:01.889 --> 17:03.791
It's much harder, I think, except at one time.

17:03.992 --> 17:04.913
I love it.

17:04.933 --> 17:06.175
I can't imagine doing anything else.

17:06.235 --> 17:11.882
He had a wonderful quote from David McCullough, who was one of my great favorites, and he wanted to see my book.

17:11.902 --> 17:13.805
He had gone on for a few years.

17:14.145 --> 17:20.994
But I remember the last time I met him, he said, now you've got to do a biography.

17:21.014 --> 17:22.977
It's incredibly addictive, and I have to be careful.

17:23.834 --> 17:25.817
I said, yeah, well, who?

17:25.837 --> 17:27.880
Who do you write about?

17:27.900 --> 17:29.263
He said, well, you've got to do this.

17:29.283 --> 17:30.364
He said, now you've done this book.

17:30.404 --> 17:32.468
He said, now you've got to be a biographer.

17:32.488 --> 17:33.730
I'll think of someone for you.

17:33.830 --> 17:37.856
I'm an expert at thinking of subjects for other people.

17:37.976 --> 17:45.288
The problem with it is that you, and this is very similar to being an editor in some ways, you very much displace your own existence.

17:45.348 --> 17:46.290
You become very absent.

17:46.310 --> 17:48.373
You start dating your Czechs, 1944.

17:48.607 --> 17:50.250
And there's a good reason for it.

17:50.270 --> 17:55.519
I mean, you start living in someone else's clothes, you start living in someone else's costume.

17:55.539 --> 17:57.502
Every time you put your clothes on, you think, I would have made it.

17:57.682 --> 17:59.446
It's very disturbing.

17:59.726 --> 18:03.753
You know, one thing about women, and I can't think of the name of it.

18:03.773 --> 18:07.900
I'm not going to mention it in this piece, but... Well, let's mention it.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.983
I'm not going to mention it.

18:10.324 --> 18:10.885
You know, let's agree.

18:11.337 --> 18:18.806
That's important to me.

18:18.886 --> 18:37.868
I mean, I think when you read biography, part of it is, you know, a sense of voyeurism about someone else, you know, about what it's like to be someone else, but part of it is because you want to read history, and an easy way to swallow history is

18:38.168 --> 18:39.730
in fact, to read about someone else's life.

18:39.750 --> 18:45.616
So all the early aviation stuff, and France in the 30s, and the whole colonial empire, I thought was tremendously important.

18:46.156 --> 18:51.882
And I've been getting these lovely letters from French diplomats saying, you've recreated my childhood.

18:51.902 --> 18:55.766
So I've decided, yeah, I've decided I didn't necessarily botch it.

18:55.866 --> 19:01.492
But very nice letters about, I felt, I could feel like I was 16 years old again, walking through the Luxembourg on my way to class.

19:01.652 --> 19:04.075
Now, did you know what you love, technically your love?

19:04.628 --> 19:14.879
My husband read a bit.

19:14.899 --> 19:19.564
There's an extremely gifted aviation story.

19:22.047 --> 19:22.828
I think I abused him.

19:22.848 --> 19:24.810
He's always thought I was amused.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.051
I definitely amused him.

19:26.071 --> 19:27.012
He thought of it as a pleasure.

19:27.032 --> 19:30.636
I'm happy to say I didn't make very many mistakes, but the mistakes I did make, he caught.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.525
And most of them were not aviation mistakes.

19:32.846 --> 19:36.911
They were very funny things like, you know, misspelling Argentine or something like that.

19:38.113 --> 19:40.216
But he did a fabulous job.

19:40.376 --> 19:46.124
It's crazy if somebody points those things out to you.

19:46.164 --> 19:46.745
That's Kate Scott.

19:46.765 --> 19:54.136
You have to give me her... The new Mozart book, the biography that's coming out from HarperCollins.

19:54.256 --> 19:56.219
I noticed that he credits her in there.

19:56.279 --> 19:56.779
Oh, really?

19:56.799 --> 19:57.841
Oh, then we have to have her.

19:57.861 --> 19:58.302
Okay.

19:58.322 --> 19:59.323
She's...

20:00.029 --> 20:05.635
I mean, I could go on and on and on with the embarrassment that you love.

20:05.655 --> 20:15.405
Every time someone catches something, you just think, public... I'm curious if I'd rather talk about anything.

20:15.425 --> 20:27.657
You don't have to worry with me, because I did a Margaret Atwood piece this week, and I did a little nothing hookup for it.

20:27.890 --> 20:42.017
I feel that a little book of hundreds of people created a little thing that they're bad opening up to is really

20:42.200 --> 20:45.323
I haven't read it, though.

20:45.403 --> 20:47.445
Have you read it?

20:47.485 --> 20:49.647
You have, must have.

20:49.787 --> 20:54.491
But, you know, I did a nice personality piece and really didn't get a stage in my own research.

20:54.591 --> 21:07.602
I mean, you know, the problem with biography, if you do one, and I'm sure it's problem with your book, too, is that you do all this research that never, I mean, the stuff just ends up in the cutting room floor over and over and over again.

21:07.722 --> 21:10.705
It's not 50 times as much.

21:10.988 --> 21:17.658
I've got a house filled with material, I feel like that.

21:18.179 --> 21:22.666
Do you have this sense of, I'm amazed at how expensive you are.

21:23.347 --> 21:30.157
I mean, you were in panic when you finally had a contract and then you actually had the right to support it.

21:30.177 --> 21:35.185
Yeah, I thought I was best under pressure as a janitor.

21:35.465 --> 21:37.328
So the contract didn't scare me.

21:37.348 --> 21:38.430
There were panic attacks.

21:38.613 --> 21:40.897
But the enormity of the budget.

21:40.977 --> 21:41.197
No.

21:41.237 --> 21:46.906
This time I will feel that because I'm smarter now, I already have.

21:47.127 --> 21:50.632
There were times where I laugh and I thought to myself, thank God he only loves to be 44.

21:50.652 --> 21:52.735
I definitely had that.

21:52.836 --> 21:55.840
Next time I'm going to write about River Seen.

21:56.461 --> 22:06.257
But no, the one thing that struck panic into my heart, I've been finishing on time or remotely on time, because this is the 60s I've ever seen.

22:07.705 --> 22:13.811
Because of the 50th anniversary, the French had to have it out earlier in the year.

22:13.951 --> 22:16.953
Whereas the French mistress was a real problem.

22:16.973 --> 22:22.058
I mean, she definitely knew him better than 90% of the people with whom I spoke.

22:22.719 --> 22:26.242
And her policy, we played a little cat and mouse game with each other.

22:26.262 --> 22:28.924
I would go to see her every two days when I was in Paris.

22:28.984 --> 22:30.966
I probably interviewed her 50 or 60 times.

22:30.986 --> 22:33.949
And there was flabulation every time.

22:34.069 --> 22:36.531
Or just maybe I would see her once or twice a week.

22:36.764 --> 22:40.069
over the course of the three or four months stays I would do in Paris.

22:40.269 --> 22:50.104
And the conversations would always begin with some incredible insulting held in my direction, which was expected essentially to silence me for the next 45 minutes.

22:50.265 --> 22:53.810
So she would establish the agenda then?

22:54.051 --> 22:55.092
In a way, in a way.

22:55.112 --> 23:00.240
And occasionally she would ramble onto something that resembled the territory on which I had questions.

23:00.220 --> 23:01.382
more often than not.

23:01.682 --> 23:06.209
I mean, it was a very, very difficult relationship, and I had no idea ever how it would resolve itself.

23:06.349 --> 23:08.372
Did she insist on identity?

23:08.392 --> 23:10.496
She insisted, but I never mentioned her name.

23:10.936 --> 23:11.657
Big difference, yeah.

23:12.599 --> 23:13.941
But I never mentioned her name in France.

23:14.061 --> 23:23.916
The initial deal was that she would either speak to me, she would only speak to me if I would not use her name, and if I would show her the passages in which her presence appears, when she appears.

23:24.284 --> 23:27.309
I had no problem with that either.

23:27.329 --> 23:36.122
I mean, if it's pertinent and you want to get it right, I would read things to people and get, you know.

23:37.163 --> 23:41.550
My feeling was, well, she could have said at that point, I don't want this, then I might have had a problem.

23:41.902 --> 23:46.055
The real split choice there was, was I going to be taken to task for not mentioning her name?

23:46.336 --> 23:47.359
Her name doesn't mean anything.

23:47.459 --> 23:52.335
Her name is sort of the equivalent in America of DuPont or something.

23:52.355 --> 23:52.856
DuPont, actually.

23:52.876 --> 23:54.501
Why did the critic give you a high ten?

23:54.521 --> 23:55.043
I mean, I don't know.

23:55.063 --> 23:55.765
I don't know.

23:55.785 --> 23:56.046
I don't know.

23:56.178 --> 23:57.780
No, it didn't.

23:58.481 --> 24:10.554
Her name is published now in France, and actually there was an international held trivia writing on me which says, she is commonly known to be a much-mentioned film, so I thought I had got my revenge and I hadn't had to write it, but that's traumatic into my heart.

24:10.574 --> 24:13.558
It was very important to me always to keep a line of communication open with her.

24:13.918 --> 24:15.660
It's only because I thought she could correct me.

24:15.740 --> 24:24.430
I mean, she knew things, other people would say things, and she suddenly couldn't have gone to London in 36, and I was sleeping with him through the winter, he was seeing Paris or whatever, but... Was she supportive?

24:24.410 --> 24:25.174
No, never.

24:25.516 --> 24:26.380
Never supported it.

24:26.400 --> 24:31.365
In many words, I had a lot of... Why did she help?

24:31.531 --> 24:52.810
She wrote a book about him after he died, and it became, under a different name, of course, and that became this sort of urtext about Chevrolet.

24:52.830 --> 24:54.653
It's in the book that she wrote it.

24:55.156 --> 25:00.822
Of course, everyone always politely refers to that book in France as, you know, by Pierre Chevrier, but it's really immense.

25:00.842 --> 25:12.475
No other woman had written about him, and I think it confused her that he had this young American Jewish woman coming to her wanting to write about him, and she couldn't quite figure out what to do with me, and I think she was a little worried.

25:12.616 --> 25:17.221
She was worried that if she didn't talk to me, I could inflict more damage than if she did talk to me.

25:17.301 --> 25:19.663
So I think that's basically why she talked.

25:19.964 --> 25:24.589
But it was always a very sort of debilitating thing to have to deal with.

25:24.772 --> 25:39.405
Yes, especially because a lot of the people who had major records I needed to see were French Air Force generals.

25:39.807 --> 25:43.194
And they're, you know, what does this woman want?

25:43.254 --> 25:46.640
No, not at all, but just, you know, clearly she's not serious.

25:46.660 --> 25:52.171
There's a certain amount of sexism in France, and there's a definite amount of anti-Semitism in France.

25:52.291 --> 25:53.113
Just sheer confusion.

25:53.253 --> 25:54.496
She couldn't possibly be serious.

25:54.696 --> 25:56.179
She must be here on a different pretense.

25:57.239 --> 26:02.025
with enough assistance or whatever you want to call it, I ultimately got the files I needed.

26:02.106 --> 26:06.952
But it would take three or four tries, or it would take, you know, it always does in a country like France.

26:07.032 --> 26:16.865
But particularly when you're dealing with, you know, when you're a woman dealing with the military and asking about something, someone, like Sandex, who has become a sort of national myth, definitely.

26:16.885 --> 26:18.968
All right, let's ask another question.

26:18.988 --> 26:21.812
And I'm not asking you to tell me

26:23.463 --> 26:32.807
The gender issue never occurred to me, frankly.

26:33.529 --> 26:37.118
Only, and I don't think it did occur to me, until

26:37.368 --> 26:47.019
two things happened until I started trying to talk to the military people and realizing that it was requiring either a very short, short, an enormous amount of charm to get just a home on it.

26:47.039 --> 26:52.305
And I thought there was another book being written and had the very same experience that you had of someone else's.

26:52.325 --> 26:54.968
Everyone has someone like that in danger of her life.

26:54.988 --> 26:57.311
And realized it was a savage attack on something.

26:57.511 --> 27:03.898
And I did realize that I think it was never published in America, thank God.

27:03.878 --> 27:08.044
I had a certain more patience with him.

27:08.404 --> 27:11.709
What's the basis of the attack?

27:11.729 --> 27:16.456
He was a spoiled brat kind of thing.

27:16.476 --> 27:20.462
I think I had more patience with that as a woman.

27:20.482 --> 27:25.549
There were 150,000, I couldn't believe the numbers, of the annual sales.

27:25.782 --> 27:29.989
The small figures are wings out of stars and flight to ours are unbelievable.

27:30.250 --> 27:35.118
Anyway, you do have a man who's strolling around New York, and it varies because he can't spell.

27:35.138 --> 27:40.888
The English in there are his books in Bloomingville's windows, and maybe there are cartoons about him in the newspaper.

27:41.469 --> 27:45.436
He's a complete celebrity.

27:45.456 --> 27:47.019
I did a little crazy.

27:47.039 --> 27:49.022
Yes, bizarre.

27:49.002 --> 27:50.765
Good for you.

27:50.785 --> 27:54.531
I said, that's a good catch.

27:54.611 --> 27:57.675
I mean, she doesn't just have the motor.

27:57.776 --> 27:58.817
It's good for you.

27:58.877 --> 28:01.021
Yeah, she's right there in the bindings.

28:01.141 --> 28:03.965
You know, it's too hard for noticing that little tink on the back.

28:04.286 --> 28:04.446
Yeah.

28:04.486 --> 28:06.209
You ought to have to get permission for that.

28:06.229 --> 28:07.851
I mean, that's a big deal.

28:07.871 --> 28:10.836
Yeah, because they're in the skater, I'm just saying.

28:10.856 --> 28:11.998
They were extremely... I'll tell you later.

28:12.058 --> 28:12.158
Yeah.

28:12.256 --> 28:16.844
In fact, that may actually be editions.

28:17.124 --> 28:23.976
In other words, there may be three English language editions, but it's a lot of books.

28:24.638 --> 28:30.588
So many people just really only know him from that book, but there is quite a body of work.

28:30.608 --> 28:32.391
It's more than a one-shot.

28:32.540 --> 28:43.655
So that was one of the sort of initial intriguing things, was this whole, he's not, there is a lot of him in that book, but that book is hardly representative of the life or the work.

28:43.675 --> 29:02.080
And it's not, you know, it's the best book, it's the best known book, but the most sort of lyrical passages, you know, the real diehard fan is the person who's going to pick up one town in stars or flight to ice, and say these are the supreme accounts of flight, basically, one of the most poetic things that have been written about having the wind go through your hair while you're in the open cockpit.

29:02.160 --> 29:02.260
Yeah.

29:02.375 --> 29:10.527
It's that funny sense of... My older daughter, I mean, I have it.

29:10.567 --> 29:11.128
Reading that.

29:12.631 --> 29:14.533
The Little Prince.

29:14.553 --> 29:15.034
No, the other one.

29:15.174 --> 29:16.256
The Little Prince, Dad.

29:17.278 --> 29:18.800
Yeah, I mean, it's a beautiful book.

29:19.241 --> 29:29.496
But, I mean, The Little Prince is funny because if you look back at the other books with The Little Prince in mind, and, of course, when we read the other books, we've hardly thought about, you know, we're 13 years old and we've hardly thought about The Little Prince.

29:29.780 --> 29:31.543
You see all the images of the little prints.

29:31.583 --> 29:35.230
They're there just to be plucked off the trays in the early books.

29:35.411 --> 29:38.236
It's all there from the first days in the desert, really.

29:38.256 --> 29:41.563
Would there be a biography without a little fence?

29:41.643 --> 29:46.011
Do you think there'd be enough of a residence?

29:46.031 --> 29:46.472
Good question.

29:47.245 --> 29:54.597
I think his reputation has... It's a little bit like asking, you know, would we still care about J.M.

29:54.617 --> 29:56.040
Barrie if there weren't Peter Pan?

29:56.781 --> 29:58.244
No, probably not as much.

29:58.484 --> 30:00.868
I mean, it certainly would have made him a cult figure.

30:01.048 --> 30:01.409
Yeah.

30:01.429 --> 30:09.743
I mean, there's exactly, there are these enormous, you know, there's all the Barrie plays, you know, all that stuff, but...

30:10.111 --> 30:20.126
But the one thing that has made him rise above the path or, you know, the real thing is when those pictures people say it's changed my life, you know, it's given me a philosophy, it's racing to a very different level.

30:20.286 --> 30:24.893
You know, I don't think the appeal would, it would clearly be a great biography, but no one would care.

30:25.153 --> 30:38.413
You know, this being your first, your book, your first biography, did the guy ask you, well, was there this, this medical kind of a process where this guy doesn't come alive for you, I mean, where you want to teach you?

30:38.849 --> 30:39.470
Oh, yes.

30:39.490 --> 30:41.312
You know him.

30:42.674 --> 30:45.498
You mentioned you writing checks out and dating him in 1944.

30:45.518 --> 30:46.959
There were curious moments like that.

30:46.979 --> 30:59.275
You know, some of it, I wrote about this in an essay, which the Washington Post was doing, but at one point someone gave me some document they had lying around, which was his, and I realized I had written it on the back.

30:59.415 --> 31:03.861
It was a very beautiful, very little prince-like, very lovely little prince.

31:04.094 --> 31:05.557
to a friend.

31:05.938 --> 31:10.148
And the friend kept a little weeping willow tree on his roof terrace in New York.

31:10.168 --> 31:16.263
And it was all about how he nurtured this tree against the smog of whatever it was called there in the pollution of New York City.

31:16.283 --> 31:18.588
And he doted on it and he chased the birds away.

31:18.689 --> 31:20.533
It's very much like the little prince in his roses.

31:20.902 --> 31:26.328
And the whole thing had been written on the back of a dry cleaner cardboard from New York.

31:26.348 --> 31:29.231
And it just pushed the whole thing that much closer.

31:29.271 --> 31:30.673
It made it that much more personal.

31:31.153 --> 31:39.082
I'm sure when you'd be in the room with one of the women with whom he was particularly intimate, there'd be the sense of, you know, the great pain or magic dust, sort of.

31:39.923 --> 31:48.192
You mentioned in the proposal that you love proposing to get over work, certainly you had an idea of what you wanted to accomplish, but you also, you must have ignored.

31:51.192 --> 31:58.118
Absolutely no idea.

31:58.198 --> 32:05.225
It's faster than a lot of people are able to do it.

32:05.245 --> 32:07.627
I work day and night, it's true.

32:08.287 --> 32:09.629
I didn't have any other job.

32:09.949 --> 32:15.934
A tremendous amount of child care, let us not forget the nanny.

32:16.034 --> 32:18.837
It makes it extremely

32:19.019 --> 32:21.010
General's husband has let me write on weekends.

32:21.030 --> 32:23.865
I mean, this is key.

32:24.284 --> 32:25.465
I researched like crazy.

32:25.485 --> 32:28.928
I probably over-researched at times.

32:28.948 --> 32:29.769
I felt I couldn't.

32:29.789 --> 32:37.156
I mean, I felt I wouldn't be able to say something if I didn't know the 10 things that I didn't... I'm still researching my book, and it's already published.

32:37.176 --> 32:39.217
I'm still researching my book, and it's already published.

32:39.237 --> 32:41.800
But don't you find that there are things that, gee, I wish I had that.

32:41.820 --> 32:47.065
So that's why I said to those 24 years or whatever of his life, it says to you, I mean, there's still, who's the person?

32:47.225 --> 32:54.291
Oh, Sylvie Weiner, whom I mentioned, died, left her papers to her son, who happens to teach at William Salt Lake,

32:54.271 --> 33:08.737
She showed me all her papers, I'm quite sure, but she always was very disorganized, and she was always moving house, and some papers would be here, and some would be there, and there's that off chance I missed something, and I want to see what she gave me, and just because I wonder if I missed something.

33:09.298 --> 33:14.187
Totally not, and it's funny because it's all sort of, you know, the search for the new subject,

33:14.453 --> 33:20.522
It's very much like replacing someone who's been living in your house with a new house desk.

33:21.003 --> 33:26.412
I have one, and it's been like chewing Sandex and his cigarette smoke out of the house.

33:26.732 --> 33:30.718
And then when you said, did you know what you were getting into, I had no idea what it would be like to live with him.

33:31.079 --> 33:34.464
I mean, there are times I just want to shake him by the shoulders and say, how can you become stupid?

33:34.504 --> 33:40.073
And then there are times where you're just enamored with... A number of people fight.

33:40.533 --> 33:42.857
When you ask them about picking the subject,

33:43.023 --> 33:46.587
But I'm certain they have to be that they want to do it.

33:46.607 --> 33:47.448
Love affair.

33:47.588 --> 33:47.749
Exactly.

33:47.809 --> 33:55.458
I can't tell you, how many people have told me the way Tommy talks about these big biographies about tipping this subject or David McCullough.

33:55.478 --> 33:57.080
He's given up in mid-stream.

33:57.400 --> 33:58.922
That's why he's not reading?

33:59.403 --> 34:00.043
Oh, yeah.

34:00.063 --> 34:03.147
He's doing, he's doing, he's a chaplain now.

34:03.788 --> 34:04.529
Oh, is he really?

34:04.789 --> 34:08.193
He was doing, he was doing Picasso.

34:08.373 --> 34:09.655
He was doing Picasso.

34:09.854 --> 34:12.579
No, until he decided he accepted it.

34:12.599 --> 34:15.044
I didn't know that.

34:15.324 --> 34:17.027
And so he gave it up.

34:17.047 --> 34:19.572
And Joe, Justin Sapp was the same thing.

34:19.592 --> 34:21.275
He was doing grants.

34:21.295 --> 34:23.800
Until McFeely came out.

34:23.820 --> 34:25.102
And that was a program.

34:25.202 --> 34:27.106
That doesn't help.

34:27.767 --> 34:31.153
But McCullough also was, remember when the Teddy Roosevelt book did come out?

34:31.173 --> 34:31.474
Impressive.

34:31.758 --> 34:36.283
People still went ahead and did morning's horseback.

34:36.363 --> 34:40.988
But people will say, and they'll use a different expression.

34:41.008 --> 34:44.332
Well, you know, it's like kicking them all over a lot.

34:44.352 --> 34:46.454
You know, you're going to be sweeping up this person.

34:46.674 --> 34:49.998
You're going to be doing those sports that you don't even like in the first place.

34:50.098 --> 34:53.762
I mean, things I wouldn't do for my husband.

34:54.122 --> 34:54.983
Absolutely.

34:55.124 --> 34:59.809
So you really, now tell me about the next step.

34:59.829 --> 35:01.090
Perhaps for some of those reasons.

35:01.998 --> 35:15.438
The music sort of appeared on the horizon, then I threw, you know, a woman that buys the first pair of shoes she tries on kind of reasonably, I threw like 20 other names up in the air and tried to pretend she was there, because I think I was afraid of inviting the first person to the house.

35:15.458 --> 35:20.966
It's the wife of Vladimir Nabokov, Baron Nabokov, to whom he dedicates every book, whom he's married.

35:21.567 --> 35:29.980
He's been married for 52 years, she's through it, she's not, you know what I mean, and it's a really wonderful, I mean, it's a truly marvelous, happy marriage.

35:30.230 --> 35:32.014
And yet, he's a very, as we know.

35:32.415 --> 35:34.460
Yeah, yeah.

35:34.480 --> 35:38.890
And I still realize that, you know, it's time I stopped writing about French Catholics, you know, aristocrats here, right?

35:38.910 --> 35:40.674
Because I've read about something a little closer to home.

35:41.496 --> 35:45.184
And, you know, it's this whole sort of lost world thing, which

35:45.586 --> 36:13.635
on some level I really related to which I didn't realize until I was writing about that in his case you've got the whole sort of chateau life which fairly existed in the 20th century but he was born into it and sort of woke up one day and realized there's no room in the world for an aristocrat in the 20th century and kind of everything disappears out from under him as he gets older you know the early airplanes suddenly airplanes are these sophisticated things he doesn't even know how to fly and the airline goes under and then France goes under and it's like world after world and

36:14.088 --> 36:15.470
In her case, she had the same thing.

36:15.630 --> 36:29.388
You know, she has to leave Russia, and she goes to Berlin, and as you do, they have to leave Berlin, and then they shuffle into France, and of course France falls, and they shuffle off to the U.S., and you think it's the same process of sort of the world folding up behind them in some way.

36:29.408 --> 36:32.853
I love his lectures, and the lectures are better at all.

36:33.473 --> 36:35.196
I have a lot of pleasure.

36:35.316 --> 36:35.716
It's so great.

36:35.736 --> 36:36.397
Yeah, wonderful.

36:36.417 --> 36:39.381
When did she die, or did she shuffle out?

36:39.481 --> 36:40.062
She died in 91.

36:40.767 --> 36:44.894
Have you made contact with the family?

36:44.914 --> 36:45.415
Yes, I know.

36:45.555 --> 36:46.738
Are they supportive of something?

36:46.758 --> 36:47.419
Yes, I think so.

36:47.439 --> 36:48.220
I mean, you never know.

36:48.881 --> 36:50.785
Be careful what you say poorly if you would.

36:51.045 --> 36:51.987
You never know.

36:52.227 --> 36:53.630
I wouldn't even get into it.

36:53.690 --> 36:54.912
I'm just curious.

36:55.333 --> 36:56.094
Yes, they love the idea.

36:56.114 --> 36:59.400
I don't think, in all fairness, I don't think she would have loved the idea.

36:59.549 --> 37:03.896
It was an extremely private person.

37:03.956 --> 37:04.317
Totally.

37:04.938 --> 37:10.768
But how a woman of that genius could have been... But she had to determine that she was a woman of genius.

37:11.429 --> 37:12.390
Totally.

37:12.591 --> 37:19.002
You can tell by what she's written about her and by things that have been said by other people.

37:19.803 --> 37:21.085
Edmund White has said that

37:21.335 --> 37:26.942
on one of the early meetings with her, she recited back to him two pages from the first novel.

37:27.102 --> 37:30.406
She'd photograph his memory, seemingly photograph his memory for prose.

37:31.368 --> 37:34.051
She was the only editor her husband had, or she edited his book.

37:34.592 --> 37:37.215
She would lay a tie in to check his translation.

37:37.315 --> 37:40.479
I must have known that, but I'd forgotten it.

37:40.499 --> 37:44.524
You know, you have an interesting parallel with that.

37:45.145 --> 37:52.295
that you use in your book here is M. R. Lindbergh in a way to express how fresh she did have her own life.

37:52.896 --> 37:56.742
No, but that's a very similar, and always stood behind Charles even when she disagreed with him.

37:56.802 --> 38:01.248
It makes clear that their politics don't drive, and yet she stands by her husband, as you would in those days.

38:01.849 --> 38:04.032
That was one of the most

38:04.535 --> 38:08.520
things for me to write, because I talked to her about meeting Sandex, and I had the diaries.

38:08.540 --> 38:09.862
But you use it in the brain.

38:09.882 --> 38:11.924
You can't think you can get a pinch size.

38:11.944 --> 38:14.227
Yeah, that wasn't great.

38:14.568 --> 38:25.862
He made this impression on people that was so, especially in his 30s and 40s, when they just, no one ever forgot him, people would say, you know, charisma plus, when you walk into the room, the temperature changes.

38:25.882 --> 38:31.328
So that comment seemed particularly justified to me, that her son would say, oh, he's a saint.

38:31.369 --> 38:32.550
Yes, exactly, no, and

38:32.750 --> 38:39.522
One of the British reviewers who really liked the book said it was like he had a hula hoop around, like a saint has around him.

38:39.722 --> 38:49.560
Talking about, you know, things, how the research continues, I wouldn't be a bit surprised if you still a lot of really valuable things from people who are going to read the book.

38:50.249 --> 38:50.950
About his life.

38:51.170 --> 38:53.934
Yeah, things will start, people will learn.

38:53.954 --> 38:58.481
Well, the nice thing about the piece of the New York Times was that, I mean, you probably found this as well.

38:58.501 --> 39:01.044
That actually extended the research by a year.

39:01.305 --> 39:01.986
Actually, yeah.

39:02.306 --> 39:04.629
I actually had to make a trip to California.

39:04.649 --> 39:05.531
Because of that piece, right?

39:05.551 --> 39:09.116
Because of stuff that was totally denied to me the first time around.

39:09.136 --> 39:10.498
But you became somebody, right?

39:10.518 --> 39:16.666
All of a sudden, now Bill Martin at the Huntington Library says, I'll get you, what do you do?

39:16.727 --> 39:16.847
Right.

39:16.867 --> 39:17.067
Right.

39:19.325 --> 39:30.042
It's better than anything, but it's the first time in the Huntington Library's history that they've had a private collection of exhibitions.

39:30.102 --> 39:30.663
It's just close.

39:30.683 --> 39:33.468
200,000 people came here.

39:33.488 --> 39:35.771
Her stuff is as good as the Huntington's and the Illinois State.

39:35.791 --> 39:38.015
There isn't a go.

39:38.035 --> 39:39.918
If you're married, this is a second, third, I think.

39:39.938 --> 39:41.260
Yeah, you don't have to know that.

39:41.280 --> 39:43.423
Oh, well, I've got a time speaking.

39:43.443 --> 39:45.687
Also, did you run an office query in the Times?

39:45.920 --> 39:50.469
The all this query from the Times was fascinating for me because I got 140 pieces of mail.

39:51.290 --> 39:52.673
Some of them, you know, absurd.

39:52.693 --> 39:54.537
Have you ever raised me in seven stars?

39:55.038 --> 39:57.843
Some of them are unsolievable numbers.

39:57.863 --> 40:01.450
And when I first started, it must have been 1990s.

40:01.470 --> 40:03.835
But then the Times did the most wonderful thing.

40:03.855 --> 40:07.101
They could have done the accident and they ran it again three months later.

40:07.402 --> 40:09.085
Another 60 pieces of a man.

40:09.987 --> 40:14.975
And among those, the first time around, was Sylvia Reinhardt, whom I'd been looking for in Austria.

40:14.995 --> 40:15.937
She was living in L.A.

40:16.338 --> 40:19.223
I mean, just fabulous, fabulous things.

40:20.024 --> 40:29.140
I think that's not how I found Jean Renoir's son, which is how I got the wonderful Renoir stuff, but just people who'd met him once, people who might subject quickly often have a better...

40:29.423 --> 40:31.746
because they don't know anything.

40:31.826 --> 40:32.708
Often they don't even know.

40:33.048 --> 40:51.634
They have no idea the extent of the strain, but they have these fabulous anecdotes filled in an extremely precise way.

40:51.952 --> 40:53.994
I want to send you some clothes, sorry.

40:54.014 --> 40:54.875
Do you want to see your clothes?

40:54.895 --> 40:55.816
Absolutely, I want to see your clothes.

40:55.956 --> 41:01.082
I want your copy of tradition dress and I want your New York Times piece because I missed it because my daughter was born.

41:01.202 --> 41:04.165
Do you want to see your clothes?

41:04.185 --> 41:06.727
Do you want to see my killer press kit?

41:07.128 --> 41:07.468
Yes.

41:07.488 --> 41:08.689
Do you want to see my British reviews?

41:08.709 --> 41:08.790
Yes.

41:08.810 --> 41:14.415
This is what they say, model biography, flawlessly written.

41:14.756 --> 41:18.340
I don't have a card.

41:18.500 --> 41:18.820
I'm all right.

41:19.576 --> 41:37.348
I'll take your pedicle.

41:37.852 --> 41:56.923
I think I heard this story from someone who had your name, which I think is unusual, isn't it, Pastor?

41:57.190 --> 42:03.216
What can you tell me now?

42:04.257 --> 42:05.699
What can I tell you?

42:05.719 --> 42:11.965
If I have any questions, I'll give you a call.

42:12.105 --> 42:15.869
I'll do this pretty quickly.

42:15.889 --> 42:16.970
Thank you.

42:17.010 --> 42:25.459
That would redeem me after the time's run.

42:26.367 --> 42:41.001
I often find that the conversation will go off on a tangent.

42:41.487 --> 42:45.114
To me, it would happen to fly, and somebody would just throw something out.

42:45.595 --> 42:48.080
You don't realize stuff about your character until later as well.

42:48.341 --> 42:55.074
And the little things someone just tossed off that you may not have written down in your notebook, if they were on tape, later struck you a different way.

42:55.115 --> 42:58.421
In a way, you ended up listening and re-listening to the tapes.

42:58.501 --> 43:02.770
One thing I find about the tapes is that I do tend to be lazy during the album.

43:03.610 --> 43:04.431
Right.

43:04.471 --> 43:05.713
Because you know it's all on tape.

43:05.733 --> 43:06.775
You'll listen to it later.

43:06.815 --> 43:07.075
Right.

43:07.195 --> 43:09.118
Hold on, turn it off.

43:09.799 --> 43:11.702
You have to pay attention to me now.

43:11.722 --> 43:12.243
Okay.

43:12.363 --> 43:13.986
How many interviews?

43:14.006 --> 43:14.627
How many interviews?

43:14.647 --> 43:15.809
Would you say you did?

43:16.209 --> 43:16.730
Yeah.

43:16.830 --> 43:18.312
I don't know.

43:18.352 --> 43:18.953
Hundreds?

43:18.973 --> 43:19.214
No.

43:19.334 --> 43:20.796
Oh, for the people for the book?

43:20.816 --> 43:22.699
150.

43:22.983 --> 43:25.086
That's including multiple interviews sometimes.

43:25.166 --> 43:27.049
Did you have any reviews from anyone?

43:27.289 --> 43:30.033
I got reviews from the people whom I thought might cause problems.

43:30.053 --> 43:32.196
That's usually a kind of feeling.

43:32.877 --> 43:34.279
I didn't get any reviews.

43:34.299 --> 43:35.901
It's up to the lawyers or the publishers.

43:35.921 --> 43:40.647
I only got releases after the fact, and the legal department looked at it and said, so is our insurance all could get you a problem.

43:40.667 --> 43:44.212
Joe McGinnis told me, he said, the only time you ever, I like, did you know Joe?

43:44.232 --> 43:45.874
I didn't know, he wasn't there when I was there.

43:45.894 --> 43:46.455
He was a friend of mine.

43:46.475 --> 43:47.016
He was a friend of mine.
