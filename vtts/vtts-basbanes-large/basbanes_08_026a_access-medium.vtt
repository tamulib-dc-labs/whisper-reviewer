00:02.512 --> 00:30.730
A couple of things that Publishers Weekly likes, and this is just because I don't know if you've seen many of their interviews or not, but they do like to have a brief summary of who your agent is and who your editors are, and I don't know if we have to go through that ad nauseam because you've got so many books, but if you could just give me some sense of

00:31.418 --> 00:41.470
They do like, you know, how you get started, and I dispense with this in two graphs, usually, but they'll always ask for it if I don't have it in there.

00:42.231 --> 00:56.769
Your first book, and I guess when we get to the Halleck book, it is pertinent to how Eisenhower, how you became involved, and I think in that case, that is pertinent, and maybe we could just talk a bit about that.

00:58.711 --> 01:00.413
Well, like most academics, I might

01:00.983 --> 01:04.968
publishing career began with university presses.

01:04.988 --> 01:15.663
And my first book was about Henry Halleck, who was Lincoln's chief of staff.

01:16.223 --> 01:20.489
And LSU Press published that book.

01:20.509 --> 01:30.923
And I doubt that they ran a thousand copies.

01:31.544 --> 01:34.347
It got some reviews and scholarly journals.

01:36.350 --> 01:38.813
And then, like almost any of them, well, anyway.

01:38.973 --> 01:43.358
And then it became a part of the library and a part of bibliography.

01:43.378 --> 01:45.701
But altogether, I think, yeah.

01:45.721 --> 01:49.385
At the outside, it had a thousand reviews.

01:49.405 --> 01:51.007
But one of them was Dwight Eisenhower.

01:51.027 --> 01:53.671
Isn't that something?

01:53.691 --> 01:53.831
Yeah.

01:53.851 --> 01:53.991
It was.

01:54.031 --> 01:55.012
Life-changing for me.

01:55.953 --> 02:00.218
And then he called me, and I went up to Gittesburg to meet him and talk to him about it.

02:00.239 --> 02:01.100
He called you on the phone?

02:01.400 --> 02:01.500
Yeah.

02:02.577 --> 02:05.000
I mean, was it Dwight Eisenhower?

02:05.300 --> 02:05.440
Yeah.

02:06.461 --> 02:06.982
Retired.

02:07.282 --> 02:10.906
Right, but I mean, he called and said, Mr. Ambrose, this was Dwight Eisenhower, something like that?

02:10.926 --> 02:11.066
Yeah.

02:11.967 --> 02:13.249
Did you say, give me a break?

02:13.449 --> 02:13.990
No.

02:14.110 --> 02:16.533
He didn't need to identify himself.

02:16.573 --> 02:17.253
I knew his voice.

02:17.434 --> 02:24.441
I'd seen him on the television.

02:24.501 --> 02:27.585
So I went up to see him, and he... About when was this?

02:28.145 --> 02:29.026
This was in 1963.

02:31.950 --> 02:32.230
And...

02:33.695 --> 02:42.888
we talked about my being one of the editors of his papers and writing his biography.

02:42.908 --> 02:43.910
I was 28 years old.

02:45.332 --> 02:54.184
And he, at the end of the session, he said, well, you must have a lot of questions.

02:54.204 --> 02:59.692
And I said, I certainly do, General, but the overwhelming is curiosity.

02:59.772 --> 03:00.293
Why me?

03:01.675 --> 03:03.077
He said, I read your book on hell.

03:05.943 --> 03:07.385
You really could have knocked me over.

03:08.386 --> 03:09.388
Isn't that something?

03:09.788 --> 03:17.499
And then he went on to explain that he had himself been thinking about writing something about Halleck.

03:19.222 --> 03:23.428
And it came out in an odd way.

03:23.448 --> 03:27.934
When I got the Overlord in command in explaining

03:30.327 --> 03:41.285
In the period before that decision was made, in talking to Ike, Roosevelt had said, listen, you and I know the name of Lincoln Street staff, but very few people in America do.

03:42.106 --> 03:44.590
I don't want that to happen to George Marshall.

03:44.610 --> 03:50.520
He's going to have to have a field command to escape that kind of delirium.

03:52.643 --> 03:57.010
And Ike had thought of writing about Halleck and

03:59.723 --> 04:01.465
bringing the martial angle into it.

04:01.545 --> 04:10.055
And then he said, and then I read your book, and I decided that this is a good book, and I don't need to write about it.

04:10.075 --> 04:10.595
Okay, that sounds nice.

04:12.197 --> 04:17.343
But I would like you to work on my papers and be my biographer.

04:17.363 --> 04:26.013
Did he say this on the phone, or was this the... No, this was... I know you said you went to Gettysburg, but when he called you and invited you... It was at the end of the meeting at Gettysburg.

04:26.033 --> 04:29.477
But he just invited you up to see him, so you really didn't know what you were going up there for?

04:29.879 --> 04:40.432
Oh, no, I knew that I was going up there to talk about this position, which was a bit complex.

04:40.452 --> 04:44.336
Johns Hopkins was publishing.

04:44.356 --> 04:49.242
Johns Hopkins Press was going to publish the Eisenhower Pages, which sit over there on their shelf.

04:50.003 --> 04:52.045
They're now up to something like 15 volumes.

04:54.128 --> 04:58.553
And I wanted to keep an academic connection.

04:59.528 --> 05:02.291
So we worked out a deal, this is what I was talking to him about.

05:03.693 --> 05:27.139
We worked out, and his brother was president of Hopkins, and we worked out a deal that I would be, I would work on the papers, but I would also have an appointment in the history department and teach a course, and then interview the general with the biography as an end result.

05:29.414 --> 05:35.322
So, that was what I fell into in 28, because Black Eisenhower happened to pick up that book.

05:35.903 --> 05:37.845
There's a little kicker to that story.

05:43.733 --> 05:56.350
When May died, I could will the farm at Gettysburg to the National Park Service, but May was to stay in it until her death.

05:57.612 --> 06:15.299
And then when Mamie died, John called me and said, Steve, I'm over at the house, and the kids are here, and we're clearing out things that we want to keep, because it all becomes the property of your National Park Service tomorrow, or whatever the dating was.

06:16.481 --> 06:25.375
And here in Dad's bedside bookshelf is a copy of Palette, marked up.

06:27.262 --> 06:27.863
Do you want it?

06:30.286 --> 06:34.871
And I thought and didn't reply.

06:34.972 --> 06:36.934
And John said, you've got to be quick.

06:36.994 --> 06:40.298
I've got a lot of people to call.

06:40.318 --> 06:41.720
I said, well, John Disney will wear things.

06:44.103 --> 06:44.964
And it's there today.

06:45.004 --> 06:48.728
A little mistake.

06:49.890 --> 06:50.591
Yeah, I don't know.

06:50.611 --> 06:52.193
I mean, I'm glad it's there.

06:53.054 --> 06:54.375
But anyway, that's where it's at.

06:54.395 --> 06:56.458
It's certainly, you think there's some

06:56.607 --> 06:57.248
scholarly.

06:57.308 --> 07:02.074
I think it would be wonderful if you had that book, but that's not the story.

07:02.094 --> 07:04.377
Well, that's too late now, anyway.

07:04.397 --> 07:07.121
Yeah, you talk about epiphanous moments in a career.

07:07.381 --> 07:16.653
It's almost what we were talking about last night, these little incidents, and we're talking about history on a grand scale, his history on an individual's scale of one life.

07:17.394 --> 07:22.260
That phone call, you probably would have spent your career very happily as an academic,

07:22.797 --> 07:25.100
Now, that did change your life dramatically.

07:25.160 --> 07:26.061
Would you agree with that?

07:26.161 --> 07:27.382
Sure, of course.

07:27.923 --> 07:31.166
And perhaps you could just and then follow through.

07:31.206 --> 07:32.328
What happened?

07:32.388 --> 07:40.056
Tell me a little bit about those years you spent with the Eisenhower Project.

07:43.440 --> 07:44.961
Turned in on years.

07:45.262 --> 07:48.726
For me personally and for the country, the goddamn war was on.

07:49.607 --> 07:52.770
And here I was a military historian working with ICE.

07:53.172 --> 07:56.856
and teaching on a college campus.

07:56.876 --> 08:07.369
I was very productive.

08:07.469 --> 08:09.171
I don't know.

08:09.191 --> 08:12.575
I can't even look at this back to figure out how.

08:13.596 --> 08:15.619
It was a wonderful time.

08:15.959 --> 08:22.487
These were Ike's papers that I was working with, and the man himself.

08:23.885 --> 08:26.467
This was only 20 years after the war.

08:28.389 --> 08:29.510
Less than 20, really.

08:29.530 --> 08:31.812
And so I was seeing stuff that nobody else had ever seen.

08:32.392 --> 08:33.834
Marshall to Eisenhower letters.

08:34.214 --> 08:35.475
Eisenhower to Marshall letters.

08:38.458 --> 08:47.205
We had to go through a lot of rigmarole and top secret clearance and had to set up our offices with a big fucking safe that we finally ended up.

08:47.285 --> 08:48.987
We never did block that kind of thing.

08:49.007 --> 08:50.628
This is on Baltimore, I mean?

08:51.269 --> 08:51.369
Yeah.

08:51.389 --> 08:52.930
Yeah, on the Hopkins campus.

08:54.192 --> 09:02.843
And it was a wonderfully exciting time in my scholarly life.

09:06.068 --> 09:10.694
And I know it's a stretch, but we talk about discovery and seeing things for the first time.

09:11.715 --> 09:17.062
You're talking about correspondence and paperwork that no outsider has seen before.

09:17.122 --> 09:21.668
Did you have these mornings, these moments of

09:22.627 --> 09:24.569
Holy shit, you're not looking through.

09:24.589 --> 09:26.571
Oh, yes, very much so, all the time.

09:26.591 --> 09:27.632
Constantly, yeah.

09:28.433 --> 09:41.346
It's a funny thing about the—I don't know if it's funny or not, but anyway, it's—a part of being a scholar is applying the seed of the parents to the seed of care.

09:41.366 --> 09:44.509
And it's a very monk-like existence.

09:44.529 --> 09:45.710
And everything you do is alone.

09:46.591 --> 09:46.912
Everything.

09:48.533 --> 09:51.216
In the scholarship and in the writing of it.

09:52.867 --> 09:55.109
And so it's a very lonely existence.

09:55.129 --> 10:02.737
But it's, most of all, some of the most intense moments of excitement in my life.

10:04.419 --> 10:06.461
The most.

10:06.481 --> 10:14.569
And I lead an active life, and I'm out a lot, and traveled a lot, and involved with things, and an ordinary life in that regard.

10:15.570 --> 10:18.013
And I have a lot of eyes, and some of those happen.

10:19.360 --> 10:30.993
But by far the most exciting moments of my life have come sitting in a research library, like most of all in the library in Alabama, reading other people's mail.

10:31.013 --> 10:35.057
And going, gah!

10:36.919 --> 10:47.511
And very, very occasionally I've been heard to do it out loud in one of those absolutely somber reading rooms where everybody else is reading other people's mail, too.

10:49.212 --> 10:52.698
But you make discoveries that just send you quivering, almost.

10:54.701 --> 10:56.303
I know it's hard, but does anything come to mind?

10:56.403 --> 10:57.325
Can you think of anything?

10:57.345 --> 10:59.208
I'm so sure there are thousands of them.

10:59.228 --> 11:00.931
To try and recall one is hard.

11:02.172 --> 11:17.076
One of the first ones that hit me that way, or one that comes to mind that hit me that way, was the first time I was reading the Eisenhower Markham correspondence in the

11:17.748 --> 11:47.063
fall of 1942 when the question was whether we were going to open a second front or not and at that time in my life I was a socialist in my politics and I was come on

11:47.330 --> 11:48.011
Yeah, I was.

11:49.313 --> 11:50.354
You talk about a 180.

11:51.836 --> 11:55.101
Well, I mean, Christ, I went to the University of Wisconsin.

11:57.724 --> 11:59.387
Or at least I thought I was a socialist.

11:59.407 --> 12:05.415
But anyway, at that time, I had the view.

12:05.435 --> 12:06.877
It was very popular among me.

12:07.017 --> 12:09.441
And this was Wisconsin in those years.

12:09.521 --> 12:11.143
It was the New Left coming on.

12:11.223 --> 12:12.825
It was William A. Williams.

12:12.845 --> 12:14.788
It was very hard not to.

12:16.135 --> 12:18.318
adopt at least some part of a Marxist outlook.

12:21.543 --> 12:34.123
And one part of that was the charge that in World War II, just the basic charge, that the capitalist powers, i.e.

12:34.143 --> 12:34.403
the U.S.

12:34.423 --> 12:43.898
and the U.K., were happily standing aside while the Red Army was being wiped out, and that this was a part of the capitalist conspiracy.

12:45.295 --> 12:51.522
And it simplifies, obviously, very much.

12:51.542 --> 12:54.445
But anyway, that was the general view I had.

12:54.526 --> 13:04.557
And I can remember reading Eisenhower in July, actually, of 42, writing the Marshal and saying, we've got to do everything we can to save this Red Army.

13:04.577 --> 13:07.340
It would be the biggest mistake in all military history.

13:07.360 --> 13:11.365
We let that Army go under it and then do everything to help it.

13:11.385 --> 13:12.366
And then he went on.

13:13.949 --> 13:17.794
That had a really profound effect on that.

13:18.435 --> 13:41.003
If there is a moment in which I could point to where I shed all Marxist orientation or outlook, it was then.

13:41.455 --> 13:48.804
the scholar who works in solitude and silence, and really you have yourself in these archives.

13:49.725 --> 13:59.077
But I think you add the extra dimension is that you also knew Eisenhower as well as you got to know him as well as anyone outside his family.

13:59.137 --> 14:05.625
And over those years, you know, how many scholars have that kind of access?

14:05.665 --> 14:10.872
And I wonder what this regular daily access brought to you to work.

14:12.387 --> 14:19.838
Well, in Ike's case, it was, I mean, I've, and none of the others make the, anything that you've got.

14:19.858 --> 14:25.286
I've known all the presidents now, and have seen them in different situations.

14:28.230 --> 14:29.532
And, starting with Ike.

14:30.514 --> 14:30.754
Yeah.

14:31.896 --> 14:32.096
Yeah.

14:32.457 --> 14:37.664
I took Harry Truman's hand, but I never had a conversation with him.

14:40.048 --> 14:41.550
And then, all the others.

14:41.952 --> 14:46.418
You can't even begin to continue.

14:47.840 --> 14:50.063
A lot of that is the personal contact.

14:50.103 --> 14:52.165
He was so wonderful.

14:52.486 --> 14:59.555
He had the most fabulous ability to concentrate.

14:59.595 --> 15:01.157
He just shut out everything.

15:01.177 --> 15:03.620
He wanted to talk about what I wanted to talk about.

15:03.640 --> 15:06.805
He put his mind fully on all of my questions.

15:06.825 --> 15:09.428
He was never a look at the watch.

15:10.825 --> 15:16.074
straightening of clothes, or calling for a coffee.

15:17.877 --> 15:22.746
I've never known anyone who had that power of concentration to compare with him.

15:22.906 --> 15:32.443
Did he have that quality, obviously, but could you sense, I know being a former naval officer, we say that if you have it, you don't command presence.

15:32.463 --> 15:33.745
If somebody walks in a room,

15:34.484 --> 15:35.305
You feel it.

15:35.365 --> 15:38.669
It's almost like your skin prickles in a way, isn't it?

15:38.749 --> 15:39.810
Absolutely, absolutely.

15:39.850 --> 15:40.791
It's ineffable.

15:40.811 --> 15:43.855
You can't really... Do you feel that in his presence?

15:43.935 --> 15:45.917
Oh, very much so, and I only knew him as an old man.

15:47.379 --> 15:49.321
He would lock his eyes on you guys.

15:49.902 --> 15:53.966
And you knew who the boss was, right?

15:53.986 --> 16:04.238
And you can look at almost any picture of life in World War II with troops, and he's always got that eye contact with the individual.

16:04.538 --> 16:09.603
And it was characteristic of him when he talked to the troops.

16:09.623 --> 16:15.528
He was very different from Bradley, who always wanted to know what the kid's specialty was.

16:15.548 --> 16:21.413
Pat wanted all these girls who were killed so far, and all this tough guy shit.

16:21.433 --> 16:28.160
Ike always, first question, soldier, where are you from?

16:28.180 --> 16:29.541
Look at him straight in the eye.

16:30.422 --> 16:32.364
Oh, yeah.

16:33.825 --> 16:34.005
Oh, yeah.

16:34.947 --> 16:45.401
So, I just, I thought the will of General Eisenhower, he was very good to me, and that has mattered a lot.

16:45.421 --> 17:00.021
And I saw things in him by being with him that, it confirmed what the moral history with others and documenting evidence showed as.

17:00.041 --> 17:04.347
Jesus, this was 20, 25 years after the event.

17:05.947 --> 17:10.651
And I'd get him going on a question on Monty or something that always pissed him on him.

17:10.671 --> 17:16.877
Just that big red would come into his face when he would start talking, and you could see him drain it away.

17:20.961 --> 17:26.126
What a privileged experience this was to really be a witness to this kind of guy.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.388
And he had the greatest concern for people.

17:29.529 --> 17:33.553
And I would go up and spend a day with him in Guittesbury, and I'd have to drive back to Baltimore.

17:33.573 --> 17:34.654
And he was worried about me.

17:36.254 --> 17:39.137
And he would worry about the roads and tell me how to drive them.

17:40.738 --> 17:42.280
And he had made that football a lot.

17:42.300 --> 17:45.403
And so he would tell me about places to eat.

17:45.423 --> 17:53.390
And one day, he said, where are you going to eat?

17:53.791 --> 17:55.712
And I said, well, I'll find a place.

17:55.732 --> 17:56.874
He said, well, I got a warning.

17:56.894 --> 17:58.495
And he named a place on that road.

18:01.378 --> 18:03.720
And he said, I was in there the other morning for breakfast.

18:05.261 --> 18:05.822
And the...

18:06.106 --> 18:15.556
Cook was a young girl who had a very bad cold and a terrible nasal drip, and I was watching her as she was doing my scrambled eggs, tripping into the end.

18:15.636 --> 18:16.717
He says, don't go there.

18:20.761 --> 18:24.465
It's about, what, three hours drive, I guess, probably not.

18:24.525 --> 18:26.207
Not that much.

18:26.247 --> 18:28.069
We used to go to Baltimore and a half.

18:28.089 --> 18:31.252
Yeah, when I was out at Penn State, we used to drive down Baltimore.

18:31.272 --> 18:33.094
Well, Penn State's three hours from anywhere.

18:33.194 --> 18:33.714
Yeah, I know.

18:33.734 --> 18:34.375
That's right.

18:34.540 --> 18:36.743
But the good news is three hours away from the next town.

18:36.803 --> 18:37.704
But from everywhere, though.

18:37.724 --> 18:38.325
But that's right.

18:38.345 --> 18:40.007
It's about three or four hours from Pittsburgh.

18:40.127 --> 18:45.294
It's by so far the most isolated state universities.

18:45.535 --> 18:47.157
Which has its own kind of character.

18:47.177 --> 18:50.662
We've been there for a football game once for the weekend with some lunch.

18:51.483 --> 18:52.604
And we had a wonderful time.

18:53.245 --> 18:55.568
It's great on a football weekend up there.

18:55.588 --> 18:57.371
That's all there is.

18:57.391 --> 18:59.193
That's major stuff.

18:59.573 --> 19:04.480
When it came time, when it came time to write it, writing about Eisenhower,

19:05.236 --> 19:14.564
Having known him so closely, did you bring a kind of baggage to this?

19:15.185 --> 19:19.309
And I don't mean this in any kind of negative way, but I mean... Let me answer that.

19:19.969 --> 19:23.633
I brought to Eisenhower a great love.

19:23.653 --> 19:25.114
To the project now we're talking about.

19:25.134 --> 19:25.614
To the man.

19:25.734 --> 19:26.155
To the man.

19:27.296 --> 19:31.259
And the project, which was, to me, a part of the man.

19:31.279 --> 19:35.243
I would get so wound up in writing those two volumes.

19:35.746 --> 19:44.200
Whether the presidency or the war, I'd get up at 4 o'clock, I'd just, I'd almost run to the office.

19:46.143 --> 19:55.197
And I was just loving the work so, but it was more important, I was just dying to see what happened next.

19:55.237 --> 20:01.247
We had these thousands of documents that we had made copies of, Maura and I, at Abilene.

20:02.425 --> 20:03.406
where what do you do?

20:03.446 --> 20:05.768
You just keep flipping through stuff, and just mark down.

20:05.848 --> 20:07.610
You don't even bother to read it.

20:07.630 --> 20:09.872
You look at it, and you can tell almost immediately.

20:11.554 --> 20:13.756
You know the process, and so you scribble down and try.

20:13.816 --> 20:14.516
It's instantaneous.

20:14.537 --> 20:16.518
You don't have to read it.

20:16.538 --> 20:28.770
So, I didn't know it was in these documents, and I got them in a line of co-order, and I would get into the middle of a chapter, and I'd have to go to bed, or the kids would come home from school or whatever.

20:30.590 --> 20:36.821
And I'd even go to bed, and I just would dash out of bed in the morning to get out to the documents to find out what happened next.

20:37.582 --> 20:52.328
But in writing about Eisenhower, I was keenly aware of that I needed to be as objective as I could make myself, and that

21:03.462 --> 21:12.472
I had just an awful lot of surprises for almost all leaders in this book.

21:14.133 --> 21:22.382
And the general run of those surprises was always that it came down and Ike had done a good job on this.

21:22.402 --> 21:23.704
It hadn't been given credit for.

21:25.405 --> 21:29.790
So, in writing about Eisenhower, I knew I had to be as critical as I could.

21:30.749 --> 21:33.572
possibly could, and even go beyond what I really thought.

21:36.435 --> 21:43.362
Whenever I thought he made a mistake, because otherwise, all this praise of this great man was, he'd discounted.

21:44.263 --> 21:45.924
So I hit him hard wherever I could.

21:45.964 --> 21:47.366
I hit him really hard on civil rights.

21:47.426 --> 21:52.191
I hit him very hard on his dealings with Joe McCarthy.

21:53.092 --> 21:55.294
I hit him hard on a couple of military decisions.

21:56.415 --> 21:58.377
With Nixon, I had the exact opposite

21:59.487 --> 22:06.819
First of all, I never met Nixon until long afterwards, and then only briefly.

22:06.839 --> 22:09.202
The second, I didn't like Nixon.

22:09.222 --> 22:09.984
I never liked Nixon.

22:11.506 --> 22:12.327
I was a Nixon hater.

22:12.648 --> 22:14.190
So why did you write about him then?

22:14.210 --> 22:18.076
I don't mean to jump forward, but the question makes to be asked then.

22:19.619 --> 22:21.762
Well, let me answer that in a minute.

22:22.023 --> 22:22.443
Okay.

22:22.583 --> 22:24.246
I'll come immediately back to it.

22:25.795 --> 22:38.411
With Nixon, I knew wherever I found something to praise, I was going to really lay it off, because there was going to be so much negative about this guy, and I didn't want to be an Oliver Stone.

22:39.412 --> 22:40.914
It was a plus grade.

22:40.994 --> 22:48.243
It was necessary, and I came to have a very deep admiration for Richard Nixon, which was the biggest surprise of my whole writing career.

22:48.363 --> 22:51.006
I never thought that was going to happen, but it did.

22:51.847 --> 22:54.230
Not like, but admire.

22:55.372 --> 22:55.752
Respect.

22:56.542 --> 22:59.086
Oh, yeah.

23:00.247 --> 23:10.342
When I was doing the author's thing for one of those volumes, Brian Gumbo asked me.

23:12.285 --> 23:16.310
It was cut time, and I knew it, and I was going to have a one sentence answer.

23:17.111 --> 23:18.053
I didn't know what he was going to have.

23:19.134 --> 23:23.781
And he said, and we'd gone through some of this, and he said, well, would you trust him?

23:26.090 --> 23:30.336
Nixon was still very much alive, of course.

23:30.356 --> 23:31.338
Would you trust him?

23:31.358 --> 23:35.143
He said, I said, I'd trust him as president.

23:35.383 --> 23:38.107
I never trust him as a friend.

23:38.248 --> 23:38.929
I love that line.

23:40.511 --> 23:41.392
He came rushing after me.

23:41.412 --> 23:42.514
He said, can you stay another day?

23:42.534 --> 23:43.575
We'd like to put you on the bill.

23:44.256 --> 23:44.817
Really?

23:44.837 --> 23:46.239
He came back the next day?

23:46.259 --> 23:47.541
No, I said, no, I can't.

23:48.803 --> 23:50.305
Now, how did I do Nixon?

23:50.505 --> 23:51.907
Because Alice told me I had to.

23:52.048 --> 23:53.389
Now, this gets back to where you started.

23:54.311 --> 23:55.853
Since I got into the big one.

23:55.893 --> 23:58.957
Well, that's really... You don't mention her in this book, right?

23:59.017 --> 24:03.283
As soon as Alice is here, I don't know.

24:03.303 --> 24:06.027
Yeah.

24:06.047 --> 24:07.710
I did Nixon as Alice told me to.

24:08.731 --> 24:09.933
You left your way.

24:09.953 --> 24:11.095
You ready to tell you what to do?

24:11.996 --> 24:12.737
That's the only time.

24:14.219 --> 24:15.300
She said, you've got to do it.

24:16.102 --> 24:16.763
What did she say?

24:16.863 --> 24:17.123
Why?

24:18.065 --> 24:29.963
Except because we've been talking, and she left the big shots at SNF, and there's no Nixon biography, and you're the perfect person to do it.

24:29.983 --> 24:32.787
And I said, else I don't like it.

24:32.807 --> 24:38.836
I want to spend, at that time, I thought, maybe five years with that son of a bitch.

24:41.541 --> 24:46.468
And she said, Steve, where can you find a bigger champ?

24:47.208 --> 24:50.991
And she caught me with that line.

24:51.011 --> 24:54.414
And I just like her so much, and I admire her so much.

24:55.635 --> 24:58.898
When I see her write, she's my audience.

24:58.998 --> 25:06.525
I've now been through about 11 books for Alice.

25:06.585 --> 25:06.785
Wow.

25:07.886 --> 25:11.229
You're already answering your questions, actually.

25:11.249 --> 25:11.969
She's your audience.

25:11.989 --> 25:12.930
You're writing for Alice.

25:13.431 --> 25:16.253
Yeah, because I know Alice so well, because

25:16.975 --> 25:23.721
It used to be that my scripts would come back to me, and she just would have scribbling all over them.

25:23.741 --> 25:27.585
And she taught me enormous about writing.

25:27.605 --> 25:28.666
Stylistic?

25:29.406 --> 25:30.727
Stylistic, word choice.

25:31.128 --> 25:32.269
Really?

25:32.609 --> 25:35.011
This is on the line editing?

25:35.031 --> 25:36.593
On the line editing.

25:36.613 --> 25:37.273
On the line editing.

25:37.313 --> 25:38.314
She's an absolute genius.

25:38.334 --> 25:41.737
She is without question the best I've ever known.

25:42.878 --> 25:43.599
By far.

25:43.939 --> 25:44.620
By far.

25:46.051 --> 25:50.518
Yeah, she's an almost impossible person to work with.

25:51.379 --> 25:52.020
Imperious?

25:52.341 --> 26:01.255
Oh, well, she's New York, and she's fast-tracked New York, and extraordinarily bright, and very opinionated, and terrifically good.

26:02.377 --> 26:05.281
What she does... I'm going to use that quote, okay.

26:05.301 --> 26:06.824
That's fine.

26:07.264 --> 26:09.788
But she's also just, it's simply a secret.

26:09.808 --> 26:11.171
I tell her this all the time.

26:11.271 --> 26:12.092
I've got it in one.

26:14.435 --> 26:18.780
It's impossible to work with.

26:19.521 --> 26:21.182
She gets great assistance.

26:21.202 --> 26:23.765
You go on, you get, I get the easy thing to work with me.

26:23.785 --> 26:24.686
No, that'd be bad.

26:25.187 --> 26:29.031
I love it because my man wins.

26:29.051 --> 26:30.052
That's okay.

26:30.473 --> 26:32.395
I'll look at it.

26:32.415 --> 26:38.561
Anyway, I say in the intro that Liz Stein, who is her current assistant, she's had a lot.

26:38.621 --> 26:43.767
I've been through about five of these assistants that she has, and it's the best job in publishing.

26:44.590 --> 26:58.828
And they've gone on to, they've all gone on to great fame in Stockton, at the very top of the New York Publican world, at relatively young ages, after putting up with Alice for anywhere from two to five years max.

27:01.311 --> 27:05.216
They even had a little club of the ex-Alice.

27:06.778 --> 27:10.342
People would get together for a drink once in a while, and tell Alice stories.

27:10.442 --> 27:12.825
Were you a mentor, do you think?

27:13.312 --> 27:14.714
Well, for these young editors.

27:14.734 --> 27:16.816
Oh, for those of you, oh, sure.

27:16.976 --> 27:17.858
She doesn't do it consciously.

27:17.898 --> 27:22.744
Just being around Alice puts them immediately right into the fastest track.

27:22.884 --> 27:25.247
What was the first book you did with her, do you recall?

27:25.267 --> 27:26.909
Eisenhower, the first volume of Eisenhower.

27:26.929 --> 27:27.830
And how did that happen?

27:28.090 --> 27:29.432
How did that come to pass?

27:29.452 --> 27:35.900
Well, at that time, I had an agent, and I said, I'm going to do this bio-review of Eisenhower.

27:35.920 --> 27:37.722
Do you recall where the agent was?

27:37.742 --> 27:38.102
John Werth.

27:38.643 --> 27:39.885
What's his name?

27:39.965 --> 27:40.325
W-A-R-E.

27:41.246 --> 27:41.406
John.

27:42.508 --> 27:42.728
And...

27:42.944 --> 27:46.969
John put it out for auction.

27:47.549 --> 27:48.691
And Alice Bedias.

27:50.373 --> 27:51.234
So I met with her.

27:51.394 --> 27:54.418
I hadn't met her, and I had my first meeting with Alice, who was in New York.

27:54.458 --> 27:56.320
I was on my way to London for whatever.

27:57.021 --> 28:09.896
And we had a coffee together at a cafe, John and Alice and I. It was, I know it was a big advance.

28:09.976 --> 28:11.618
It wasn't the biggest advance I got.

28:12.408 --> 28:17.114
I don't need to know that anymore.

28:17.575 --> 28:17.675
Yeah.

28:18.336 --> 28:24.964
But anyway, I signed the contract sitting there, and then as I signed, I looked her in the eye, and I said, you didn't make a mistake.

28:24.984 --> 28:27.047
And she looked me in the eye, and she said, I don't know.

28:27.067 --> 28:27.488
Is that correct?

28:28.169 --> 28:28.269
Yeah.

28:28.889 --> 28:29.350
How old are you?

28:29.430 --> 28:30.992
You're still a young man at this point.

28:31.052 --> 28:31.713
Are you a young man?

28:32.394 --> 28:33.776
No, not all that young anymore.

28:33.856 --> 28:38.963
This was 1970s, I guess it must have been.

28:38.983 --> 28:40.224
You're not young enough.

28:40.244 --> 28:40.845
So I was...

28:43.694 --> 28:46.677
40 years old.

28:49.219 --> 28:52.382
Yeah, about 40.

28:52.403 --> 28:54.465
How old is Alice?

28:54.745 --> 28:55.486
How old are you now?

28:55.506 --> 28:56.346
How old am I now?

28:56.547 --> 28:58.889
It's because you tell me different years and you're different ages.

28:59.429 --> 29:00.470
I'm 59 now.

29:00.571 --> 29:03.854
I was born in January of 1936, so I'm almost 60.

29:03.874 --> 29:06.216
So when this comes out in January, you'll be... I'll be 60.

29:08.378 --> 29:13.363
So Alice is fun to talk about, and she can be

29:13.917 --> 29:21.526
so blunt and so short with you, and she gets so goddamn mad, that I just try to avoid ever having to talk to her.

29:21.726 --> 29:25.230
I just want to deal with your time right back.

29:25.250 --> 29:28.874
I mean, somebody that line edits your manuscript, you get to know them awful well.

29:28.934 --> 29:32.618
But mostly what I get to know is what works and what doesn't.

29:32.638 --> 29:34.080
And she's just superb at that.

29:35.321 --> 29:40.347
And she can pick out the superfluous paragraph or sentence or word that anybody

29:42.368 --> 29:44.550
She never tries to tell me what to say.

29:45.451 --> 29:55.559
She never, ever gets involved, and very, very occasionally she will ask me, don't you want to comment on this after a political scene?

29:55.580 --> 29:59.603
And when Nixon did X, Y, or Z, or I did, don't you want to comment on this?

29:59.643 --> 30:03.366
That happens once a book, maybe, maybe twice.

30:04.227 --> 30:08.050
But she never argues with me on interpretation, and of course never on fact.

30:09.271 --> 30:11.093
But the presentation of the research,

30:12.912 --> 30:13.853
She's just wonderful.

30:13.873 --> 30:22.885
Now, I knew enough to try to keep the narrative going forward, but she is just a bear on this.

30:22.905 --> 30:24.267
Don't ever flash forward.

30:24.287 --> 30:25.448
Don't ever flash back.

30:25.989 --> 30:27.191
That's her philosophy, too.

30:29.173 --> 30:36.523
She's the one that taught me that.

30:38.073 --> 30:44.240
I think for all writing it's the rule, but absolutely it's the right, it's the rule for writing history.

30:44.260 --> 30:48.204
And the tension just actually builds that way.

30:48.224 --> 30:52.048
And Jesus, these, and flash forwards just kill it.

30:52.068 --> 30:55.692
And flashbacks, as a matter of fact, are just an anchor on the narrative.

30:56.133 --> 31:05.683
And it's a simple enough thing to say, it's awfully hard to, I mean, I still have to fight it if you want to flash ahead.

31:06.575 --> 31:09.239
In a way, what she taught me about is to have faith in your reader.

31:10.941 --> 31:14.466
That the reader is not... This is a book.

31:14.486 --> 31:19.073
This isn't a magazine article or a newspaper article that you pick up and put down.

31:19.133 --> 31:22.758
This is a book that's going to require a commitment on the reader's part of a lot of time.

31:23.799 --> 31:26.063
And it's going to be there for a long time.

31:27.144 --> 31:28.426
You're mindful of that, aren't you?

31:28.546 --> 31:28.927
Oh, sure.

31:29.447 --> 31:36.177
And you've got to trust your reader.

31:39.734 --> 31:46.843
And she catches me on repetition sometimes, and you're driving this point too hard type of thing.

31:46.863 --> 31:52.931
And if it's, if the story, if I've got a guy, I've got one here.

31:53.111 --> 32:01.742
I'm working on the nurses and the doctors now in the European Theater of Operations.

32:05.873 --> 32:07.194
actually lives right over in Bay St.

32:07.274 --> 32:18.804
Louis, the 101st Airborne guy who got it in the neck of about an eighth of an inch of his spinal column, and was in, and I'm going to leave him right there.

32:18.884 --> 32:20.205
It's a Christmas Day story.

32:21.586 --> 32:25.790
And then I'm going to pick him up later, as time goes by.

32:25.970 --> 32:35.678
And he had those goddamn Crutchfield tongs on, and had to lie without moving for six months.

32:35.945 --> 32:43.372
It was a million dollar one.

32:43.392 --> 32:48.757
But the temptation to tell the whole of Walter's story is very great.

32:51.560 --> 32:56.104
But if you put it back where it belongs, it has a much bigger impact on the reader.

32:56.144 --> 33:01.889
And if it's action stuff, of course, the narrative tends to build by itself, just by sticking to chronology.

33:01.909 --> 33:03.671
Now, if you keep this in your head, you write this down.

33:03.691 --> 33:04.872
I've got to get back to this guy.

33:05.206 --> 33:07.889
Would you have little notes to yourself, or...?

33:07.909 --> 33:11.292
I have notes all over the place to myself, yes, absolutely.

33:11.312 --> 33:15.917
So you must outline fairly, to very detailed outlines.

33:15.937 --> 33:17.419
You must know, you know if it's... No, I don't.

33:17.519 --> 33:18.680
I don't work with outlines at all.

33:19.721 --> 33:26.929
But I... These are one part of the interviews for the book I'm working on now.

33:27.649 --> 33:34.116
And I go through this stuff so often that I can tell you immediately what Lieutenant Colonel Russell's got a good story on.

33:35.345 --> 33:37.709
or I know exactly when I'm going to use Vanderburg.

33:39.531 --> 33:41.013
These are all interviews you've done?

33:41.734 --> 33:49.206
No, these are some interviews I've done, some oral history tapes that men send in, and some of them are written memoirs.

33:49.947 --> 33:51.569
A lot of these guys would rather write.

33:52.951 --> 33:56.316
How about, do you use researches, or do you do everything yourself?

33:58.600 --> 34:03.887
Until the last few books I've done it all myself, now I have my son working for me.

34:03.907 --> 34:04.288
That's great.

34:04.690 --> 34:08.335
He spent four months in Germany.

34:09.176 --> 34:09.877
Which one?

34:09.897 --> 34:14.943
He's got German and doing interviews with German veterans.

34:14.963 --> 34:16.605
Which one would give him his full name?

34:16.625 --> 34:17.066
I like that one.

34:17.086 --> 34:21.131
Hugh, H-U-G-H, Ambrose.

34:21.151 --> 34:27.940
And so he did these four months of interviewing over there, about 250 interviews.

34:27.960 --> 34:28.080
Wow.

34:28.901 --> 34:33.567
And he is now just finishing the transcribing of them.

34:34.188 --> 34:35.069
That's exciting.

34:35.089 --> 34:37.552
Do you think it would always sound like that in a project?

34:37.753 --> 34:41.538
Oh, yeah.

34:41.818 --> 34:42.419
He's working.

34:43.661 --> 34:47.746
And I'm getting a benefit out of it, a lot of benefit out of it.

34:48.227 --> 34:52.012
But I, and Maura has often helped me.

34:52.692 --> 34:58.400
Most of all, in the library in Abilene, where at various times we probably stayed for a year.

34:58.720 --> 35:02.826
You mentioned that earlier.

35:02.846 --> 35:02.946
Yeah.

35:04.546 --> 35:08.571
I came to have great confidence in her ability to pick out the documents that I would want.

35:08.591 --> 35:13.658
Your writing is so, and I mentioned this last night, it's just so beautifully readable.

35:13.898 --> 35:17.022
I mean, you write, you engage the reader.

35:17.103 --> 35:18.244
We went through this last night.

35:18.284 --> 35:19.185
Did you ever read aloud?

35:19.946 --> 35:23.591
Do you write also for that, for the second?

35:23.611 --> 35:28.177
The first thing that happens, and it happened just this morning.

35:28.197 --> 35:29.419
The first thing that happens.

35:30.020 --> 35:31.842
You've printed it out, too, don't you?

35:31.862 --> 35:32.823
I printed it.

35:32.843 --> 35:34.165
I assume when I'm done.

35:34.668 --> 35:38.393
I printed it, and then I can't wait to read it.

35:38.413 --> 35:40.036
I just can't wait to read it.

35:44.262 --> 35:53.675
And I find that reading aloud, it just takes me back to Alice for a minute.

35:53.695 --> 35:57.921
When I'm writing, I've got Alice in mind, and what would she like to know?

35:57.941 --> 36:02.768
She's got a very good eye for what works.

36:03.625 --> 36:05.908
So I'm, what would Alex like to know next?

36:07.050 --> 36:09.233
And will Alex like this story?

36:09.253 --> 36:09.813
Or so on.

36:10.715 --> 36:14.660
But my first immediate audience is myself and Morrow.

36:15.962 --> 36:21.710
Because when I get done, we find the time, and then I'll read the chapter and on to them.

36:21.730 --> 36:28.118
And I was able to hear myself and be in the audience.

36:28.138 --> 36:30.221
And very often.

36:30.882 --> 36:32.004
You kept all the awks.

36:32.645 --> 36:33.025
You can't.

36:33.292 --> 36:34.754
You can't read it.

36:34.974 --> 36:35.915
You know, it's awkward.

36:35.935 --> 36:36.736
I do the same thing.

36:36.917 --> 36:40.601
And anyone who loves Shakespeare is going to read with rhythm.

36:41.022 --> 36:47.911
You're going to be alert to the rhythms of the language and the things that just don't feel good popping off the tongue.

36:47.931 --> 36:50.254
And I had that sense of reading as things as it reads.

36:51.115 --> 36:53.498
Very quotable stuff.

36:53.618 --> 36:54.740
I work very hard on that.

36:54.760 --> 36:59.586
I appreciate the compliment a lot, because I really do work hard on that, and I am aware of

37:00.106 --> 37:04.610
asking people who are going to read this to make an effort on their part, and I've got to make an effort to.

37:06.112 --> 37:09.595
Sometimes I think what I do is I just read an enormous amount.

37:11.336 --> 37:12.778
And then I pick out the very best stories.

37:14.319 --> 37:21.406
And then, one of the services that I do is that.

37:22.046 --> 37:28.172
The people that are interested in history, whether it's World War II or Lewis and Park or Civil War or whatever,

37:29.114 --> 37:35.561
They don't have time to read all the documents I've got time to read, but I pick out the best of them and put a frame around them.

37:39.726 --> 37:57.906
But I'm always aware when I'm writing of that, whether the image in my mind is sitting around the campfire and Alice is camped with us and she's on the other side or whatever, but wanting that tension always there for people waiting for just a little bit to find out what happens next.

38:02.223 --> 38:13.754
So, when I do a chapter like this one, I thought about it and thought about it and thought about it, and I pretty much had it the way I wanted it in my mind before I started writing it.

38:13.774 --> 38:17.058
I mean, you find a lot of surprises while you're writing, but definitely.

38:17.738 --> 38:30.711
I knew where I was going to go, which is difficult with these chapters, because this is a section that's going to come in the middle, and it's not going to be narrative battles.

38:31.400 --> 38:45.595
Instead is the theme chapters, replacements and how they got them in, medicine on the front, Christmas Day in 1944, and what it was like to be in a foxhole at night.

38:45.615 --> 38:50.800
So these are, I don't have a chronology in these.

38:50.840 --> 38:53.663
They're much harder to organize.

38:53.683 --> 39:00.310
To think how you move from, how did you dig a foxhole, how did you eat in a foxhole,

39:02.855 --> 39:04.517
Well, it sort of was very challenging.

39:04.777 --> 39:05.798
Yeah, yeah.

39:06.459 --> 39:11.966
But so while I'm doing that, and transitions, of course, are extremely difficult in a chapter like this.

39:13.648 --> 39:18.073
I really work my ass off on transitions because Ike told me this once.

39:18.353 --> 39:25.081
We were talking about a piece of writing, and he said, you can't change the subject that quickly.

39:26.883 --> 39:32.710
If people need to have, and that's when I adopted a system that I've used ever since, is that

39:33.044 --> 39:36.507
And just saying, read your transition.

39:36.527 --> 39:37.708
I couldn't think of one.

39:37.728 --> 39:40.230
We're going over to New Subject, and I couldn't think of a way to transition.

39:40.250 --> 39:41.692
How do you indicate that on your copy?

39:41.712 --> 39:44.134
Just a couple of spaces?

39:44.274 --> 39:44.494
Yeah.

39:44.994 --> 39:45.195
Yeah.

39:45.435 --> 39:51.020
And I work really hard on transitions, because to get back to the lawyer.

39:51.040 --> 39:51.740
I do have that.

39:52.201 --> 40:02.730
Those readers in mind, and I want to make it, I want to give you the most information I can

40:02.997 --> 40:10.088
And I don't want to say in a palatable way or an enjoyable way, but in a way that, and I love the word you use, in a way that flows.

40:11.530 --> 40:11.931
There it is.

40:11.951 --> 40:12.612
It's writing.

40:13.053 --> 40:13.634
That's writing.

40:13.734 --> 40:14.375
And then the writer.

40:15.497 --> 40:15.597
Yeah.

40:15.617 --> 40:19.964
And that's the writer in you, the storyteller in you.

40:19.984 --> 40:28.397
You had mentioned, you alluded up, and I see copy here, but if you could just tell me, just tell me the book that you're working on now.

40:28.799 --> 40:30.622
You can just give me an idea if you don't mind.

40:30.782 --> 40:37.592
It's the campaign in Northwest Europe from dawn of June 7, 1944, to surrender on May 7, 1945.

40:37.612 --> 40:39.836
Yeah, yeah.

40:40.897 --> 40:48.008
And it's going to be like the D-Day work, how the high command operated and what the strategy was and so on, and then get down to how it was worked out on the ground.

40:48.028 --> 40:51.153
Do you have a working cargo?

40:51.433 --> 40:53.997
No, I'm toying with the Crusades.

40:55.765 --> 40:58.870
But Alice will never take that.

40:59.511 --> 41:01.514
That could be the kicker line, by the way, you know?

41:02.456 --> 41:05.060
I always look for my story, I always look for my kicker.

41:05.361 --> 41:07.564
Alice would never take it.

41:10.609 --> 41:14.656
I've never had, she has picked the title for all my books.

41:14.676 --> 41:16.679
She never takes me, she never will take my time.

41:17.120 --> 41:20.946
I wanted to call the D-Day book,

41:25.955 --> 41:44.601
This great undertaking, the great undertaking, which are the last words of Ike's Order of the Day, when he says, and they let us beseech Almighty God for his blessings on this great undertaking.

41:44.621 --> 41:47.044
We'll see each of that.

41:47.244 --> 41:51.490
This one, the Lewis one, I wanted to call.

41:54.608 --> 42:02.778
of Courage Undaunted, marijuana Lewis Thomas Jackson in the opening of the American West, and Alice changed it to Undaunted Courage.

42:04.340 --> 42:21.441
Of Courage Undaunted are Jackson's words, and Alice is the only editor in the whole world who would dare to edit Thomas Jackson.

42:21.521 --> 42:23.704
It's my phrase, I won't use it.

42:24.494 --> 42:27.820
Isn't that something?

42:27.900 --> 42:39.280
You said last night, briefly, because you did leave, you were with Doubleday prior to... I was with Doubleday, and then I did a couple or three books of Doubleday.

42:40.390 --> 42:42.573
See, John had been the editor.

42:42.593 --> 42:46.438
I don't think you're going to want to use John Ware when you find out how this one turns out.

42:46.638 --> 42:49.762
If you don't mind, I'll... Yeah, you're the reporter.

42:49.862 --> 42:51.063
If this is off the record, tell me.

42:51.083 --> 42:51.724
You're the reporter.

42:51.784 --> 42:52.365
Right, right.

42:52.445 --> 42:53.607
This is not off the record.

42:53.627 --> 42:57.151
If it's on the tape, I'll feel free to use it unless you tell me otherwise.

42:57.411 --> 42:58.192
Right, right, right.

42:58.212 --> 42:59.294
And I'm having my worries.

42:59.354 --> 43:02.618
I don't, you know... I take that for granted.

43:07.340 --> 43:08.943
John was my editor at Doubleday.

43:09.043 --> 43:11.026
And this is weird, every way I read, right there.

43:11.447 --> 43:15.453
And then John quit Doubleday and set up as an agent.

43:16.996 --> 43:20.842
And so he became my agent, and then he put the Eisenhower out.

43:21.282 --> 43:23.025
That was the first book he did for me.

43:23.786 --> 43:29.816
And he put it out on auction, and S&S out there, Doubleday, and some others.

43:31.299 --> 43:32.841
So that's how I went over to S&S.

43:36.736 --> 43:39.780
and they've been my publisher ever since.

43:39.800 --> 43:40.541
But that's not bad.

43:40.802 --> 43:47.411
I thought you were going to say something about John that wasn't... Oh, oh, well, no, eventually I fired him, because you'd ask about, do I have an agent now, and I don't.

43:47.471 --> 43:48.012
I do my own.

43:49.073 --> 43:57.345
I just decided that I know as much about it as these agents do, and that John really, and the 10% was just too much.

43:57.385 --> 43:58.286
That's 15 now.

43:58.827 --> 44:00.970
So I fired him.

44:01.030 --> 44:04.175
I didn't fire him, I just stopped writing.

44:04.215 --> 44:06.658
I started just doing the contracts myself.

44:07.195 --> 44:13.682
Except that when it comes to foreign stuff like that, and paperbacks, doesn't that concern you a little bit?

44:13.702 --> 44:15.464
And I guess you know how much of a bunch of others he does, right?

44:15.484 --> 44:15.744
Yeah.

44:16.585 --> 44:17.826
That's the answer.

44:17.846 --> 44:18.407
Yeah.

44:18.507 --> 44:20.048
So, he's the only agent you've ever had?

44:20.129 --> 44:22.051
He's the only agent I've ever had.

44:22.071 --> 44:25.674
And when you sold your first book to Doubleday, that was without an agent, or with an agent?

44:25.754 --> 44:26.055
Yes, without.

44:26.936 --> 44:29.498
That's the way the agent business is pretty easily disclosed.

44:29.939 --> 44:34.924
Well, it is if you've got access to General Eisenhower, yeah.

44:35.866 --> 44:46.362
We've done a lot, you know, so I'm... And how about after this next book?

44:47.964 --> 44:53.773
The working title is The Crusade, like... I don't know.

44:53.853 --> 44:54.614
I don't know.

44:54.755 --> 44:57.739
I usually do, but...

45:02.427 --> 45:06.892
That is, by this stage, if I'm writing a book, I know what the next book's going to be.

45:08.734 --> 45:09.675
And this time, I don't.

45:10.155 --> 45:15.341
I'm not worried about it, particularly.

45:15.401 --> 45:21.768
I don't know that I'll ever undertake another major research-based book.

45:21.788 --> 45:27.113
I think I've reached a point where I'm going to be doing more general stuff.

45:27.133 --> 45:30.857
I don't know what I'm going to be doing.

45:30.897 --> 45:31.378
Essays, maybe?

45:31.538 --> 45:31.658
Maybe.

45:32.650 --> 45:34.212
I can't tell you anything about this, man.

45:34.232 --> 45:39.277
It was written for November, and these guys wanted me to do an autobiography.

45:39.297 --> 45:40.678
That would be fun, wouldn't it?

45:40.698 --> 45:41.199
I don't know.

45:44.302 --> 45:44.703
I don't know.

45:44.723 --> 45:45.263
I never tried it.

45:45.684 --> 45:50.008
You said last night you were toying with a novel on the Lewis and Clarkson.

45:50.028 --> 45:50.549
I did one.

45:50.829 --> 45:52.210
I just didn't get it published.

45:52.230 --> 45:52.571
Really?

45:52.791 --> 45:56.435
Alice said, go back to writing what you do well.

45:56.455 --> 45:57.036
Did you read it?

45:57.056 --> 45:58.237
I hope so.

45:59.338 --> 46:00.379
Do you remember the title of it?

46:00.950 --> 46:02.532
It was, no, I didn't have a title.

46:02.552 --> 46:06.656
It was The Daughter of George Shannon, who was the youngest member of George Shannon.

46:07.496 --> 46:10.339
In a lot of ways, the most interesting.

46:10.539 --> 46:12.321
But we don't know hardly anything about him.

46:13.382 --> 46:15.444
Except that he became a great friend of Henry Clay.

46:15.524 --> 46:18.867
He was in the Kentucky legislature, and then was a judge in Missouri.

46:21.029 --> 46:23.312
Alice didn't want it.

46:23.332 --> 46:25.874
I said, go back to writing.

46:26.194 --> 46:27.235
But you wrote the whole thing.

46:27.275 --> 46:27.936
That's a lot of work.

46:28.507 --> 46:29.268
So, that's it?

46:29.328 --> 46:31.913
That's your one of the standard fiction, right?

46:32.113 --> 46:32.274
Yeah.

46:33.736 --> 46:34.658
Did you like it yourself?

46:35.780 --> 46:44.335
I thought... I talked to Bill O'Neill at Rutgers about it once, and while we were... He was doing one, too, at the same time.

46:44.375 --> 46:49.384
And we just were telling each other, it's so fucking easy, you just make things up.

46:49.786 --> 46:51.268
You don't have to prove anything.

46:51.288 --> 46:53.291
You don't have to use any footnotes.

46:53.351 --> 46:54.773
This is easiest writing.

46:55.393 --> 46:57.216
Neither one of them got public.

46:58.117 --> 46:58.858
How do you feel?

46:58.878 --> 47:06.167
You know, we talked again last night, and I asked you about Jefferson getting on the floor with Lewis, and you said, hey, he wrote it.

47:06.288 --> 47:08.791
If he didn't, if it's not written down, I don't do it.

47:09.732 --> 47:19.725
And I don't want to talk about Joe McGinnis or anything like this, but let's just say this kind, this trend that we see where people assume the thoughts

47:20.195 --> 47:22.878
presumed with lots of people.

47:24.639 --> 47:26.561
I guess I'm asking... I think it's unconsciousable.

47:26.581 --> 47:28.303
I think it's unconsciousable.

47:28.323 --> 47:32.487
Just a general statement on the craft and what you see, you know.

47:32.547 --> 47:32.707
Oh.

47:32.947 --> 47:37.652
Things like that, and that's the same publishing house, too, so I'm not even asking you to, you know, look.

47:37.672 --> 47:39.934
That was a major screw-up, that thing, McGinnis.

47:39.954 --> 47:46.000
McGinnis is a friend of mine, I haven't seen him in years, and I kind of went on that, went in hiding after that thing as Molly Jenner.

47:46.840 --> 47:48.102
That was terrible.

47:48.282 --> 47:50.405
It was just unconscious.

47:51.246 --> 47:53.288
And I don't understand why anybody reads it.

47:55.632 --> 48:00.137
But of course, I guess that book wouldn't know that big a success.

48:00.198 --> 48:02.140
Some of them are.

48:03.722 --> 48:04.663
But you just can't do that.

48:04.804 --> 48:10.311
I mean, you've got an obligation to protect the integrity of the past.

48:10.411 --> 48:11.953
You don't have...

48:15.663 --> 48:30.684
first of all, my absolute first rule of biography, and really of trying to deal with people in real life, it goes back to you so that I can trust you.

48:33.988 --> 48:38.474
This first one comes from life.

48:38.494 --> 48:42.800
I don't say it directly to any of us.

48:42.820 --> 48:44.202
Never question another man's orders.

48:45.970 --> 48:46.551
His wisdom?

48:46.911 --> 48:47.172
Yes.

48:47.652 --> 48:49.275
But don't question his own.

48:49.315 --> 48:51.237
And I tried to live that way, and I tried to.

48:52.138 --> 48:54.361
Dick Nixon was just the opposite.

48:54.382 --> 48:56.144
Absolute opposite.

48:56.164 --> 49:02.453
Always questioning the other man's mother and assigning to him the lowest possible.

49:02.933 --> 49:06.098
But the rule of biography comes from Dr. Johnson.

49:08.641 --> 49:14.509
And he says, we cannot look into the hearts of men, but their actions are open to observation.

49:15.653 --> 49:28.474
And this business of McGinnis and others, I know what this guy was thinking.

49:30.397 --> 49:40.513
Not only do they not know that, and they're guessing, and they're guessing at motive, but they

49:43.447 --> 49:46.191
It's just not right.

49:46.331 --> 49:47.934
It's wrong to do that.

49:48.414 --> 49:52.160
And you've entered the realm of writing fiction now, and you ought to present it as fiction.

49:52.180 --> 49:55.265
And it's the same problem that I'm going to be facing shortly.

49:55.285 --> 50:01.113
I'm going to have to do some reviews of Oliver Stone's Nixon movie.

50:01.133 --> 50:07.322
And if Oliver Stone wants to call this, if he wants to do it like Ken Warren did with you at all.

50:07.723 --> 50:10.327
How did he change the name?

50:10.347 --> 50:11.108
He changed the name.

50:11.847 --> 50:13.609
That's fine.

50:14.369 --> 50:14.770
That's fine.

50:14.790 --> 50:16.892
I'm just going to go to enjoy it.

50:16.912 --> 50:17.332
Or not.

50:17.352 --> 50:18.573
That's right.

50:19.274 --> 50:29.663
Goddammit, if he wants to say that this is history, then he's got certain obligations to that integrity of the past.

50:31.825 --> 50:33.527
Like he did with the JFK.

50:33.607 --> 50:33.827
Yeah.

50:34.708 --> 50:40.453
Because it's dramatic, and you get these good actors, and people that we know about.

50:40.957 --> 50:43.961
how valuable people are with what they see on the screen.

50:44.322 --> 50:44.863
Yeah.

50:44.883 --> 50:48.688
Anyway, I don't even want to get into that because this is a... Yeah, good.

50:49.429 --> 50:51.813
Really, we got plenty of stuff here.

50:52.534 --> 50:54.577
I got tons of stuff, you know.

50:54.817 --> 50:56.339
Just tell me a little bit about Montana.

50:56.359 --> 50:57.942
How long have you had a place out there?

50:57.962 --> 51:05.332
Or I know that this is kind of a... Well, as you know, we got committed to Montana in 1976.

51:05.453 --> 51:09.158
And we've been there every summer since, or at least some part of this summer.

51:10.319 --> 51:16.265
And three kids live there, all three of them graduates from the university.

51:16.305 --> 51:19.689
One of them with an MA from the university as well.

51:19.709 --> 51:20.610
Two of them.

51:20.630 --> 51:23.953
And three grandchildren live in there.

51:24.634 --> 51:29.739
So, we'd just go up at every opportunity.

51:30.200 --> 51:40.090
And when I retired in May, we bought a house up there, and we don't live half a year in Montana.

51:41.200 --> 51:42.081
She's wonderful.

51:42.121 --> 51:43.643
We live at the foot of a mountain.

51:43.663 --> 51:47.026
In the morning, I walk the dogs up the mountain.

51:48.548 --> 51:49.709
It's a 1,100-foot game.

51:49.789 --> 51:56.176
It takes me an hour and a half, the top and back, and the dogs just love it.

51:56.516 --> 52:00.000
It's a wonderful way to start the day.

52:00.861 --> 52:05.146
You may live in there and just don't tell anybody.

52:05.166 --> 52:06.227
That is off the record.

52:06.267 --> 52:08.409
Montana is great.

52:08.750 --> 52:09.711
Just great.

52:09.731 --> 52:11.072
What is off the record now?

52:12.048 --> 52:14.411
We don't want anybody.

52:14.431 --> 52:15.051
We're there now.

52:15.131 --> 52:16.413
We don't want anybody else coming in.

52:16.773 --> 52:18.695
How about the tree very well on Lewis?

52:18.735 --> 52:21.378
Because I didn't have a machine on when you told me that.

52:21.398 --> 52:22.800
You have a tree out front.

52:22.820 --> 52:24.461
Did you say about 500 years old?

52:24.522 --> 52:28.886
500 years old, live oak, and they have a... Live oak is the name of the tree, right?

52:28.906 --> 52:32.010
They have a society here.

52:32.891 --> 52:33.511
Here in Bay St.

52:33.591 --> 52:33.732
Louis?

52:33.752 --> 52:34.392
Here in Bay St.

52:34.432 --> 52:37.836
Louis, and live oaks can

52:38.002 --> 52:45.811
that are over 500 years old can be registered and they can go with a name tag and come here and I'll sell you one because this tree in behind is named William Clark.

52:55.862 --> 52:58.424
Maybe I'm gonna shoot a couple pictures if you don't mind.

52:58.465 --> 53:00.927
Maybe we'd shoot outside by one of those trees.

53:01.788 --> 53:05.292
That's fine.

53:05.312 --> 53:07.114
You know it stopped raining?

53:11.498 --> 53:16.986
Registered Oak, William Clark, Bay Dash Waveland Garden Club, okay.

53:17.006 --> 53:18.628
This is William Clark's tree.

53:19.049 --> 53:20.551
This is Clark's tree right here.

53:20.591 --> 53:21.753
This is out front.

53:21.773 --> 53:24.236
That's a buffalo skull.

53:24.256 --> 53:24.657
Wow.

53:25.077 --> 53:27.902
Maura picked up on the Jefferson River.

53:28.803 --> 53:31.026
Maybe we can shoot it in low water.

53:32.007 --> 53:33.910
Laura should have been in a long time.

53:33.930 --> 53:37.455
We were canoeing and went around the mud bank and she said, whoa!

53:38.136 --> 53:39.678
Maybe the horn was sticking out.

53:39.698 --> 53:40.780
Maybe we can shoot a...

53:41.384 --> 53:45.127
I got tons of stuff here, you know, and you told me your phone number.

53:45.389 --> 53:46.073
Yeah.

53:46.093 --> 53:46.979
I'm going to go take a peek.

53:46.999 --> 53:47.240
Okay.

53:47.260 --> 53:47.361
Okay.
