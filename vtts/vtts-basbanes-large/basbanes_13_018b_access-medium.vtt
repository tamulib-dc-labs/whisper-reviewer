WEBVTT

00:02.174 --> 00:07.599
Well, this guy was living as the representative of the Polytech Society.

00:10.001 --> 00:11.002
And he started collecting.

00:11.263 --> 00:11.763
He was there?

00:12.624 --> 00:13.184
He was over there.

00:13.204 --> 00:14.446
He was in Thailand.

00:14.566 --> 00:16.147
He's still there, but he's a Canadian.

00:16.167 --> 00:18.609
He's been there for at least 25 years.

00:19.771 --> 00:20.791
Really interesting guy.

00:20.811 --> 00:25.576
He was here at Harvard as a pneumata, wasn't he?

00:25.596 --> 00:25.676
Yes.

00:26.337 --> 00:28.419
On a pneumata grant for a semester.

00:28.979 --> 00:29.920
He's now in Oswald.

00:30.490 --> 00:35.335
So, killing in Burma will probably get me some background, right, you think?

00:35.355 --> 00:35.876
Oh, yeah.

00:36.156 --> 00:36.457
Bangkok.

00:37.077 --> 00:38.719
Bangkok, yeah.

00:38.739 --> 00:39.720
Well, I'm sorry, Bangkok.

00:40.001 --> 00:42.463
You were saying Burma.

00:42.503 --> 00:51.453
It's Burmese manuscripts, and the idea is that these manuscripts, as soon as Burma is free, the originals will be repatriated.

00:51.533 --> 00:53.355
I know exactly how to use this.

00:53.976 --> 00:59.282
Here at Harvard, five years ago, whenever this iron curtain fell,

00:59.752 --> 01:02.515
The Georgian archives were here.

01:03.155 --> 01:07.480
And then once they had a valid government, they went back to Georgia.

01:07.680 --> 01:08.461
I know exactly.

01:09.542 --> 01:10.743
See how things tell the guys?

01:10.763 --> 01:11.764
This is the idea.

01:11.784 --> 01:12.966
That's fabulous.

01:12.986 --> 01:17.130
So you think I can have a dialogue with this gentleman by email or something like that?

01:17.330 --> 01:26.179
But what's even more interesting is, really, when you think about it, it's not that anybody else is thinking of this, except if the Europeans are not connected.

01:26.199 --> 01:27.160
That's really interesting.

01:28.135 --> 01:29.256
Do they again know?

01:29.276 --> 01:34.963
It's interesting that it's only some Europeans and some Americans who think of that.

01:34.983 --> 01:41.690
Preservation of... The tradition itself is not thinking about it.

01:41.710 --> 01:43.812
For some reason.

01:43.832 --> 01:44.373
It's very curious.

01:46.155 --> 01:51.381
So that Burmese thing... I would hazard a guess, but I'm not going to know why that is, but it is interesting.

01:51.641 --> 01:56.286
That Burmese project, you know, Peter's fragile, it's called Fragile Palm Leaves.

01:56.992 --> 01:59.917
We've got the newsletters.

02:00.137 --> 02:01.479
He produced a newsletter.

02:03.022 --> 02:04.103
I've got the last one.

02:05.305 --> 02:08.350
Do you have stuff on this?

02:09.292 --> 02:11.215
You're in transit right now, so I'm good.

02:11.235 --> 02:15.321
I've got somebody close by.

02:16.463 --> 02:18.807
Peter right now is in Oslo.

02:20.690 --> 02:21.531
He's in Oslo now.

02:23.047 --> 02:24.549
But he goes back and forth.

02:24.589 --> 02:25.510
Well, Oslo is good.

02:25.530 --> 02:27.512
I can talk to somebody on the phone in Oslo.

02:28.033 --> 02:30.695
See, that's a little problematic thing.

02:31.617 --> 02:50.978
But what's interesting, though, is that there's now also kind of a German Japanese angle to this, because a mutual friend of ours and a former classmate of mine, Christoph Tippers, who runs the Lumbini International Research Institute in Lumbini, where the Buddha was born, funded by a Rehukai, which is a modern Japanese Buddhist set.

02:51.616 --> 02:55.841
And then he put together a large library of Buddhist texts.

02:55.861 --> 03:09.339
And he's now in Bangkok putting together an office there to reproduce his facsimile and also to scan Peter's collection with Japanese funding.

03:09.459 --> 03:15.667
And then this collection, it will go back to Burma as soon as it's free.

03:15.707 --> 03:17.069
A stable Burma.

03:17.089 --> 03:17.910
A stable Burma.

03:18.498 --> 03:21.141
And it's already promised, I think Sue knows about it.

03:21.281 --> 03:23.944
Yeah, because this is now, nobody gets to get the connection again.

03:24.605 --> 03:33.755
Sue is the woman who will be Prime Minister someday.

03:33.775 --> 03:35.036
Okay.

03:35.056 --> 03:37.318
And her husband was a friend of ours.

03:37.338 --> 03:39.721
Michael Harris, a very well-known typologist.

03:40.882 --> 03:42.164
Yeah.

03:42.644 --> 03:45.407
That's a good step.

03:45.427 --> 03:46.108
Very good.

03:48.738 --> 03:55.247
So there's... How did we get on that?

03:55.988 --> 03:59.854
Well, we talked about Conway's magazine.

04:00.555 --> 04:03.679
I was just mentioning... I guess we were talking about the monks.

04:04.240 --> 04:04.481
Yeah.

04:04.541 --> 04:05.122
And the readers.

04:05.422 --> 04:06.744
And the tradition of the reader.

04:09.107 --> 04:11.090
Yeah, exactly.

04:11.110 --> 04:16.618
Well, there's this whole tradition of... In order for a book to be alive,

04:18.877 --> 04:22.140
It has to, the lineage has to survive.

04:23.461 --> 04:36.712
So you have a lineage of, you have to have the initiations that are inherent in the deities, in the practice of the book.

04:36.732 --> 04:43.217
You have to have that book read in your presence, that's the lung, or the reading.

04:43.958 --> 04:46.180
And finally you have to have the tree.

04:46.200 --> 04:48.782
Now we've got to the point, that's the explanation.

04:49.133 --> 04:50.995
We've got to the point where only that means anything.

04:52.037 --> 04:59.446
But to its vent, if you don't have the lumens and the trees... And the wonk.

04:59.467 --> 05:00.408
And the wonk, is it?

05:01.249 --> 05:03.592
The book is dead, or the tradition is dead.

05:04.613 --> 05:06.195
And what was the last, the third element?

05:06.796 --> 05:09.460
It's empowerment.

05:09.480 --> 05:10.541
It's lumens.

05:10.881 --> 05:14.947
It's the authority to read it, which means that one will read it to you.

05:15.668 --> 05:18.972
Secondly, the empowerment is necessary for the practice of what it's written in the book.

05:19.357 --> 05:22.281
and thirdly instructions into the meaning of the book.

05:22.301 --> 05:25.326
Now this is not necessarily all religious material, is it?

05:25.666 --> 05:26.948
Or is it?

05:27.149 --> 05:31.575
Not necessarily, but it has, it's coded in a religious way.

05:31.816 --> 05:33.078
Even medical books?

05:33.098 --> 05:36.062
Even medical texts have a religious background.

05:36.082 --> 05:42.732
And even for medical texts, or for texts on astronomy, medical astronomy, or texts on jurisprudence,

05:43.218 --> 05:54.033
I mean, there's a religious coding that necessitates that you receive, that everyone receives.

05:54.313 --> 06:02.144
I was going to ask a question there.

06:02.304 --> 06:09.073
And so, Leonard, tell me how you got attracted to this involvement in the series.

06:09.779 --> 06:13.222
I was doing something completely different.

06:14.123 --> 06:25.255
I was doing biology and biochemistry when I first started out, and all of a sudden I got hold of a few books written by a chap called Peter, Herbert Peter, who was at the University of Scotland, Canada.

06:25.995 --> 06:31.341
And I was so intrigued by the way he dealt with a Buddhist artist, a Buddhist monk.

06:32.082 --> 06:34.124
That's why you're in university still?

06:34.444 --> 06:37.407
Yes, that's why I decided to draw up what I was doing.

06:37.910 --> 06:44.280
and go to Saskatchewan to study Tibetan, and to do Asian studies.

06:44.921 --> 06:47.405
The University of Washington does do some interesting things.

06:47.445 --> 06:53.814
They had a book, which I have a copy of today, the Gandhara... And I talked to them on the phone, in fact.

06:53.834 --> 06:55.517
They did an interview with them.

06:55.537 --> 07:06.634
Because I'm just interested, this was kind of almost like a Ganesha, a Buddhist version of burying some text which they found, and thankfully because of the climate.

07:07.306 --> 07:12.093
It's my only one, they found the early Gospels in Bar-Hamadim.

07:12.373 --> 07:13.054
Where is it now?

07:13.154 --> 07:15.558
What's it called again?

07:15.578 --> 07:17.581
It's the early Gospels that they found in the 40s.

07:19.243 --> 07:22.948
But in Egypt, where's the place called again?

07:22.968 --> 07:28.716
Oh, you're talking about the Chiroganesa, that was the early Gospels.

07:28.776 --> 07:30.299
Which is fascinating.

07:30.439 --> 07:33.403
Which I write about too, Solomon Schechter.

07:33.483 --> 07:36.908
It's going to be a fun book, I'm doing all this stuff.

07:37.141 --> 07:38.703
Kind of esoterica.

07:38.923 --> 07:42.448
Yeah, well, but try to make stories, you know, and you'll see.

07:42.468 --> 07:44.411
I'm going to send you a copy of the book when I get home.

07:44.792 --> 07:46.454
And then there's the Schoen collection.

07:46.474 --> 07:47.976
That's right.

07:48.357 --> 07:50.179
That's incredible.

07:50.239 --> 07:52.122
Which collection is that, Gene?

07:52.142 --> 07:53.484
Schoen.

07:53.844 --> 07:57.009
Oh, he's... In Oslo, huh?

07:57.149 --> 07:58.651
Yes, I met him.

07:59.031 --> 07:59.572
Oh, you did?

08:00.273 --> 08:05.040
I mean, he sold some books at South of East about ten years ago.

08:05.921 --> 08:06.642
It's a manuscript.

08:07.043 --> 08:14.935
European things, but he was collecting SCHO without a slack, right?

08:15.837 --> 08:18.301
That's what Peter is doing now.

08:21.806 --> 08:33.304
I have a whole chapter in here on the

08:33.470 --> 08:37.214
making of the new British Library and the French Library at the same time.

08:37.234 --> 08:38.415
It's the last chapter of the book.

08:38.916 --> 08:39.637
It's a fun book.

08:39.657 --> 08:41.839
This is really library culture, book culture.

08:43.301 --> 08:45.603
And you'll just see it.

08:45.623 --> 08:53.392
I discussed in the prolog here how after I passed a thousand pages, it became evident that I had to print this thing.

08:53.412 --> 08:53.853
It's a good book.

08:54.533 --> 08:57.417
And really the kicker was it.

08:59.319 --> 09:01.401
It got heard in Korea.

09:01.735 --> 09:05.059
on stones all over the place.

09:05.079 --> 09:06.981
The Korean what?

09:07.001 --> 09:13.288
It's the Korean, what do we call them, the Korean, Tibet.

09:13.628 --> 09:18.714
It's got a Korean canon in Chinese characters.

09:18.934 --> 09:21.397
Korean Buddhist canon in Chinese characters.

09:21.957 --> 09:26.642
I mean the whole Gilgamesh epic is discovered a hundred and some odd years ago.

09:27.023 --> 09:30.747
This is an epic that's a thousand years older than the Odyssey

09:30.912 --> 09:33.356
And it comes to you in clay tablets.

09:33.376 --> 09:36.802
Almost the whole darn thing.

09:37.924 --> 09:38.084
Amazing.

09:38.104 --> 09:40.007
It's fascinating, isn't it?

09:40.027 --> 09:43.153
And so what are they now experimenting with?

09:43.173 --> 09:49.483
You talk about migration of digital stuff, of baking the stuff on enamel, going back to the first processes.

09:49.744 --> 09:51.807
It's called the Rosetta disk.

09:52.175 --> 09:52.977
It's analog.

09:53.017 --> 09:53.878
It's not digital.

09:54.119 --> 10:05.321
They're going to do microscopic digital, and then so they figure 10,000 years from now, you'll need a microscope instead of a computer, because who's going to have a computer in 1,000 years from now, as we know it today?

10:05.341 --> 10:07.125
You need a machine to read this.

10:07.185 --> 10:13.457
The stuff that you're doing in the final analysis, you still need a machine, an interface, to read it.

10:14.686 --> 10:16.248
It's a very different kind of actor.

10:16.688 --> 10:22.794
So, I mean, it wouldn't be a bad idea to keep behind a copy of everything you send to China.

10:22.934 --> 10:29.921
I mean, that's just my one piece of... Yeah, well, that's these guys.

10:30.101 --> 10:31.383
That's what they want to do with it.

10:31.743 --> 10:35.267
Is there anything you want to tell me, Gene, that I missed that we should... Not really.

10:37.269 --> 10:40.592
I meant that things here... I am just kind of...

10:42.597 --> 10:49.986
Well, another thing that's very interesting is that Tibetan Buddhism, I mean, it derives from India, right?

10:50.046 --> 10:56.474
So really, when you're preserving Tibetan Buddhism, you're really also preserving India.

10:56.835 --> 10:58.477
When the Muslims came in, did it with that?

10:58.497 --> 10:59.198
In some degree.

10:59.518 --> 11:10.832
I mean, in the end, because you have to distinguish here between the canon, the Tibetan Buddhist canon, which is mostly is, consists of translation from Indic soldiers in most Indian books.

11:11.352 --> 11:15.616
also a few texts, a few Buddhist texts from the Chinese and from Kodim.

11:16.296 --> 11:18.618
But then you have this huge extracronomical literature.

11:19.619 --> 11:20.660
And visionary teaching.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.661
And visionary teaching.

11:21.681 --> 11:22.141
Enormous.

11:23.262 --> 11:30.248
Which, though it has Indic roots, is still manifestly Tibetan.

11:30.268 --> 11:41.157
Not only because it's written, these texts are written by Tibetan scholars, but also because they represent visions that you don't find in, but rather often to them.

11:42.183 --> 11:49.553
I really would like some nice quotes from you that I can attribute directly to you.

11:49.613 --> 11:52.777
Would you describe him as a mentor to many, many people?

11:52.817 --> 11:54.840
Yeah, I would ask him one last.

11:54.860 --> 11:56.842
Everybody would ask him one last.

11:56.962 --> 12:03.912
A good portion of his day is the Lord of Drew answering questions by email.

12:04.052 --> 12:08.478
How is it possible, one American, to learn so much about something?

12:08.518 --> 12:09.739
He's very gifted.

12:09.819 --> 12:11.802
He's a very gifted person.

12:12.085 --> 12:12.626
Amazing.

12:14.348 --> 12:18.713
Yeah, it was just a wonderful conference of different circumstances.

12:18.733 --> 12:26.041
The Rockefeller Foundation, the one man, made the money, was there, the scholars were there, and he was there.

12:26.061 --> 12:26.982
And he had the will to do it.

12:27.002 --> 12:27.683
That's right.

12:27.763 --> 12:30.166
It was a wonderful mix.

12:31.027 --> 12:35.832
When these Tibetans were in credit showrooms, they were.

12:36.132 --> 12:37.434
saying, he is the honey.

12:37.654 --> 12:41.658
We are the bees, he is the honey, he is attracting, we are here.

12:41.678 --> 12:43.701
Because it can be amazing.

12:43.721 --> 12:54.133
To come and to learn about themselves, you have to go to Grinch Village in New York City, or now up here, you know, this is the place to come.

12:55.595 --> 13:00.961
And he's so enormously generous with his time, and his knowledge.

13:01.041 --> 13:03.224
He's not crusty and cantankerous.

13:03.464 --> 13:05.346
No, not at all, not at all.

13:06.237 --> 13:11.449
So those are just a unique combination of different characteristics and traits in here.

13:12.191 --> 13:15.860
If somebody was to ask you what he is, what is he?

13:15.880 --> 13:18.887
He's not a librarian, he's our teacher, or maybe he's always.

13:18.907 --> 13:20.190
He's a preserver.

13:20.210 --> 13:21.794
Preserver.

13:21.814 --> 13:23.638
Preserver and transmitter.

13:25.475 --> 13:26.557
You said that very quickly.

13:26.577 --> 13:27.798
Have you thought of that before?

13:27.839 --> 13:28.359
No, no, no.

13:28.379 --> 13:29.541
But that's what he does.

13:31.083 --> 13:39.536
And that's in combination with profound intelligence and things that have to do with it.

13:39.556 --> 13:41.799
And does he practice anywhere else there?

13:43.722 --> 13:45.765
He knows, right?

13:46.026 --> 13:46.707
You've never asked?

13:46.947 --> 13:47.127
No.

13:48.109 --> 13:49.431
I've known him for 20 years.

13:49.491 --> 13:50.132
I've never felt it.

13:51.614 --> 13:53.777
I've never felt the need to ask about it.

13:54.128 --> 13:56.470
As he has never asked me either.

13:56.491 --> 13:59.974
Okay, so it's not a question to ask him.

14:00.234 --> 14:02.817
That's what I'm getting from him.

14:02.837 --> 14:03.678
He's been laughed at all.

14:04.379 --> 14:06.922
He's been laughed at all.

14:06.942 --> 14:11.847
Probably asked him to ask him something to do.

14:12.287 --> 14:12.608
Okay.

14:12.628 --> 14:16.352
A lot of this stuff came from refugees, of people carrying stuff, right?

14:18.153 --> 14:18.714
Yeah.

14:19.995 --> 14:23.359
Interesting enough, though, this has come up yet.

14:23.744 --> 14:39.685
In the early, before the Cultural Revolution, again, Joan Lyell had a vision of putting together a library in which the literature of the various nationalities in China would be represented.

14:40.446 --> 14:45.212
And so to this end, in 1962, 63, before the Cultural Revolution,

14:45.968 --> 14:50.415
He sent out a few Tivetans with a few Chinese Tivetans.

14:50.435 --> 14:58.346
And he sent them out to go to various monasteries in Tibet, to Galapagos, for this nationalities in Beijing.

14:58.366 --> 15:01.110
And that was what you called nationalities in Beijing?

15:01.130 --> 15:02.793
It is called nationalities now.

15:02.813 --> 15:04.695
And it's in Beijing now.

15:04.715 --> 15:05.356
It's in Beijing now.

15:05.376 --> 15:05.857
So successful?

15:05.957 --> 15:06.959
It was successful.

15:06.979 --> 15:09.743
They have collected about maybe 100,000 nationalities.

15:09.763 --> 15:10.183
Wow.

15:10.203 --> 15:11.726
So it's a huge collection.

15:11.746 --> 15:14.710
Most of this collection now has been repatriated to Tibet.

15:15.871 --> 15:23.825
And it was never really accessible in Beijing, and it's not completely accessible to them.

15:23.845 --> 15:26.209
So what is the Chinese attitude to Tibet?

15:26.229 --> 15:34.102
I mean, apparently they are going to allow them to retain some modicum of their culture, their unique culture, is that right?

15:34.122 --> 15:38.790
Well, who knows?

15:39.378 --> 15:46.647
There was some terrible news yesterday on the crackdown on Uyghurs, burning of Uyghur books.

15:48.129 --> 15:49.450
They're burning Uyghur books now?

15:49.671 --> 15:50.151
Yeah.

15:50.171 --> 15:51.934
Where in Uruti?

15:51.954 --> 15:52.214
All over.

15:52.755 --> 15:56.459
All over Turkestan.

15:57.520 --> 16:00.945
It's a conscious policy.

16:00.965 --> 16:02.066
Of whose policy?

16:02.547 --> 16:03.007
The Chinese government.

16:03.027 --> 16:03.488
Really?

16:03.508 --> 16:04.649
Are they burning books?

16:04.669 --> 16:06.111
Well, the Uyghurs are very militant.

16:06.833 --> 16:11.078
They're the ones who threw a few bombs inside the problem.

16:11.098 --> 16:16.285
And, of course, we're worried that it might be, might go to any other ethnic.

16:16.945 --> 16:19.468
Now, where did you see this story and spread it out for you?

16:20.149 --> 16:21.231
Well, I can get it at home.

16:21.351 --> 16:23.273
It's on the Times, or what were there?

16:23.353 --> 16:29.321
No, it's not in the Times, it's on the government.

16:29.341 --> 16:30.522
But it's disturbing.

16:32.084 --> 16:34.066
More than later publications?

16:34.327 --> 16:34.647
Pardon?

16:34.778 --> 16:44.592
The Bernie Martin, Wager publications, but kind of pro-independence... You're kidding!

16:45.954 --> 16:47.416
He finds everything, doesn't he, huh?

16:48.938 --> 16:50.320
He's a wife for me, the modernian.

16:52.062 --> 16:55.647
So, you teach here at Harvard?

16:55.667 --> 16:55.827
Yes.

16:55.847 --> 16:57.510
These are graduate programs, I guess?

16:57.530 --> 16:57.610
Yes.

16:58.631 --> 17:02.136
I have a few undergraduate students, I have about 12 graduate students.

17:02.977 --> 17:06.560
How are the collections at Harvard?

17:06.601 --> 17:07.181
Very poor.

17:08.743 --> 17:10.304
Is it still in the program?

17:10.584 --> 17:16.690
Well, as Dean mentioned, it wasn't Harvard, it was what we needed to do as one person.

17:17.071 --> 17:18.332
Are you basically the department?

17:20.354 --> 17:21.635
I'm the chair of my department.

17:21.755 --> 17:24.698
Well, it's a very small department.

17:24.718 --> 17:28.782
There are only seven of us.

17:31.512 --> 17:42.567
the chair of the department several decades ago, when you had the opportunity to get these PL for 80, public law for 80 books, decided not to.

17:42.587 --> 17:42.767
Amazing.

17:42.787 --> 17:44.390
That's so unharved.

17:44.410 --> 17:46.993
So they always get books, and they've got the money.

17:47.854 --> 17:49.076
It didn't cost me anything.

17:49.096 --> 17:49.697
These were free.

17:49.717 --> 17:51.439
These books came for free.

17:51.459 --> 17:52.100
Unbelievable.

17:52.120 --> 17:59.230
You just had to say yes, sign the name on the dotted line, and it was sent to you for free from the dead.

17:59.250 --> 18:00.051
So...

18:01.178 --> 18:04.203
For that reason, right now, I mean, we're doubly affected.

18:04.363 --> 18:09.592
That's my colleague, Janet Council, who is a professor of Buddhist studies in Divinity School in America.

18:09.832 --> 18:11.435
We both were 12, primarily.

18:12.116 --> 18:16.663
We're doubly affected by Gene, and the TBRC, moving to New York.

18:16.683 --> 18:19.788
Not only is Gene known to New York, but also the collection of them.

18:19.808 --> 18:21.671
Having him here must have been a great center.

18:21.832 --> 18:22.954
Wonderful.

18:23.014 --> 18:23.354
Wonderful.

18:23.755 --> 18:25.718
And like I said, I've noticed it right here, too.

18:26.643 --> 18:31.068
How did he manage to come up here?

18:31.348 --> 18:36.873
I didn't know he was here all these years.

18:37.214 --> 18:43.981
I mean, I did the interview when I got going into the writing, and I said, well, I'm going to pull that out and do it in the next book.

18:44.041 --> 18:45.062
Yes.

18:45.142 --> 18:51.809
And so is coming out with an article in the next issue.

18:51.869 --> 18:53.070
The photographer was here.

18:54.491 --> 18:56.093
They did a pretty good job.

18:56.225 --> 18:59.088
Maybe they do a very thorough job.

18:59.228 --> 19:06.075
And we're going to get an article in Tricycle, which is a Buddhist magazine.

19:06.976 --> 19:20.949
What we really need is help in presenting our case to the preservation people rather than to the... The whole book is all about preservation stuff.

19:21.710 --> 19:24.713
So maybe we can... This book will be out.

19:25.115 --> 19:32.725
The book that will be out a year from now, 16 months, I can tell you exactly, it's going to be out in the fall of 2003.

19:33.987 --> 19:39.114
And I'm still working on a title for it, but I had a title.

19:39.134 --> 19:40.135
You're not going to use Milton.

19:40.796 --> 19:41.437
I like it.

19:41.477 --> 19:50.008
Well, it's from the epigenetic, a book of precious life, a blood of a master spirit, a bond and treasured on a purpose to a life beyond, we'll call it life beyond life.

19:50.308 --> 19:51.510
But they say it's this,

19:51.845 --> 19:53.106
It doesn't.

19:53.126 --> 19:54.407
It doesn't have that pizzazz.

19:54.467 --> 19:58.451
But I like music of the spheres, and I can justify that.

19:59.032 --> 20:02.535
And then the subtitle will be, The Permanence of Books in an Impermanent World.

20:03.516 --> 20:05.177
And that'll sell it.

20:05.438 --> 20:07.419
I mean, we'll establish it.

20:10.162 --> 20:12.104
You don't do anything for The New Yorker anymore.

20:12.324 --> 20:13.505
I never wrote for The New Yorker.

20:14.206 --> 20:14.586
You never did?

20:14.626 --> 20:15.407
Oh, I thought you did.

20:15.727 --> 20:21.092
I wrote for Smithsonian, and The New York Times I do stuff for.

20:22.321 --> 20:24.323
civilization while it was still in business.

20:25.304 --> 20:32.472
But not for New York, it would be wonderful, but I've never been asked, and I thought it out.

20:32.532 --> 20:50.691
Then we've got one piece coming out in the next issue, or the first issue, the second issue of this new magazine on Buddhism coming out from the Shambhala folks.

20:54.080 --> 20:58.606
I'd like to take a few more pictures if it's alright.

20:59.367 --> 20:59.587
Sure.

20:59.707 --> 21:00.969
Get some of him before he leaves.

21:00.989 --> 21:01.309
I will.

21:02.571 --> 21:03.813
Maybe with the stuff.

21:04.473 --> 21:05.795
Yeah, I think that would be good.

21:05.815 --> 21:07.617
Why don't you get some pictures with Leonard?

21:08.659 --> 21:16.369
No, because I feel like this is something I want more corporate.

21:16.809 --> 21:18.872
Trust me, you're going to be...

21:19.055 --> 21:27.825
I want it to continue.

21:28.505 --> 21:36.875
If I were not here, we've got to find a way of getting this to continue because there's still so much to be done.

21:37.255 --> 21:41.980
So that's your greatest concern, is to see that it continues.

21:43.302 --> 21:49.028
We've got 2,000 volumes scanned, and we need to scan another

21:49.514 --> 21:50.535
10,000.

21:51.556 --> 21:57.621
So that's a total, that'll give us the, and of course stuff is still coming in from China.

21:58.082 --> 21:59.963
So is this a logistical problem?

21:59.983 --> 22:00.844
I mean, or is it?

22:01.144 --> 22:05.428
No, it's just, you know, life is permanent.

22:05.668 --> 22:06.429
It is impermanent.

22:06.509 --> 22:07.450
And so what do you do?

22:08.451 --> 22:15.818
And I want to see these materials available in every place.

22:15.838 --> 22:17.479
Books for everybody.

22:18.843 --> 22:23.289
So then once it's scanned, it has to be cataloged, it has to be processed.

22:23.309 --> 22:23.870
I'm sorry.

22:23.970 --> 22:26.353
Let me just think about that.

22:26.413 --> 22:27.495
OK, take a picture.

22:27.875 --> 22:31.240
We're going to take a picture with some of the stuff.

22:36.326 --> 22:38.710
OK, we're on.

22:38.730 --> 22:45.579
Well, maybe we can leave something upstairs.

22:45.599 --> 22:47.922
Well, I asked Leonard to do this.

22:48.323 --> 22:52.829
If you had a word to describe what you do.

22:53.209 --> 22:55.893
What's going on?

22:55.913 --> 22:58.756
This is Cameron White.

22:58.796 --> 22:59.257
Hi, Cameron.

22:59.557 --> 22:59.958
Sit down.

23:00.198 --> 23:03.663
He's a graduate student at Harvard who's helping us.

23:03.683 --> 23:08.849
I'm going to take a couple pictures, if that's okay.

23:09.110 --> 23:10.111
Get in the picture.

23:10.191 --> 23:13.335
These are informal shots.

23:13.455 --> 23:17.200
Show him what you're doing.

23:17.534 --> 23:19.135
Go ahead.

23:21.217 --> 23:25.541
I'm sorry.

23:25.581 --> 23:27.383
Thank you.

23:28.284 --> 23:29.305
You're saying you're doing what?

23:29.505 --> 23:29.745
I'm sorry?

23:30.326 --> 23:34.289
I'm learning the Tibetan how to type the Tibetan.

23:34.309 --> 23:35.110
I don't know very much.

23:35.390 --> 23:37.132
How do you type it here?

23:37.152 --> 23:37.372
I see.

23:37.392 --> 23:39.113
We have a special program, I think.

23:39.133 --> 23:43.277
You can type in with the English keyboard, but it comes up a little bit.

23:43.297 --> 23:44.638
Oh, so a Roman letter gives you that.

23:45.399 --> 23:46.981
That's what you were discussing downstairs.

23:47.201 --> 23:47.541
Yeah.

23:48.365 --> 23:50.529
And this is something Cater has gotten.

23:51.430 --> 24:10.221
It's an edict, a copy of an edict from the fifth Dalai Lama that says the bumbos are as good as Buddhists.

24:10.707 --> 24:12.048
troubled minority.

24:13.029 --> 24:15.752
Tibetans have minorities too, right?

24:15.772 --> 24:22.438
I can't show you the other world enough.

24:22.739 --> 24:25.441
But Kadrup has published many of these books.

24:26.062 --> 24:29.205
In the old days, he published, how many did you publish?

24:29.505 --> 24:30.166
Forty volumes.

24:30.546 --> 24:31.407
Forty volumes.

24:31.907 --> 24:35.170
He printed for the Bunbur community.

24:36.852 --> 24:37.913
Now he's working

24:38.399 --> 24:43.345
he's been working and having to scan the same books he published.

24:43.765 --> 24:51.635
So you actually have to know which Roman letter, almost reflexively, because you don't want to go and refer to every letter.

24:51.675 --> 24:57.161
We have a triaderation system, but you have to know it almost like a text system.

24:57.181 --> 25:01.306
Yeah, there must be a lot of thinking going back and forth between languages.

25:01.647 --> 25:02.888
And I would think

25:04.555 --> 25:06.157
Excellent.

25:06.177 --> 25:08.781
I don't want to just disrupt your work.

25:09.482 --> 25:14.289
Do you want to see some books?

25:14.389 --> 25:19.977
If there's anything that pops out to you that's especially noteworthy.

25:20.037 --> 25:22.701
It's everything, isn't it?

25:22.721 --> 25:29.291
It's literature, it's religion, it's art.

25:30.773 --> 25:33.837
This room is medicine.

25:34.829 --> 25:38.513
and astrology.

25:38.553 --> 25:39.635
Like dating from when?

25:39.995 --> 25:40.916
We can say medicine.

25:41.056 --> 25:42.518
Oh, the earliest medicine goes back.

25:44.981 --> 25:48.705
The oldest manuscripts we have are fourteenth century.

25:48.785 --> 25:49.066
Wow.

25:53.471 --> 25:55.793
And it's even older stuff.

25:56.855 --> 26:04.043
But what we did was, for example,

26:08.815 --> 26:10.477
Now, this is something you published, right?

26:10.537 --> 26:10.838
Yeah.

26:11.799 --> 26:27.880
This is an eighth-century manuscript, but that's something with Jess Hubbard's… No, it was published by the folks in Dharamsala, the Library of Tibetan Works and Archives, and it's from a collection of a Sikhanese aristocrat.

26:29.843 --> 26:38.434
It's four treaties on the principles and practices of Tibetan medicine.

26:39.376 --> 26:43.721
These are the facsimiles of the manuscripts.

26:43.741 --> 26:51.871
Now that is a facsimile, you see, but it's published as a regular codex book and not as a pamouselie.

26:51.891 --> 26:54.474
But again, it's the libraries.

26:55.996 --> 27:00.982
They don't like these books where they can't circulate.

27:01.002 --> 27:05.367
Now this can be sent out like a regular book.

27:08.485 --> 27:11.268
How extensive has your publishing program been?

27:11.869 --> 27:15.272
Well, I mean, haven't you published books yourself?

27:15.592 --> 27:15.993
No.

27:16.113 --> 27:16.313
No?

27:17.094 --> 27:20.377
I'm just interested in passing it away.

27:20.798 --> 27:21.178
Okay.

27:24.021 --> 27:26.784
These are things we have made.

27:26.804 --> 27:27.625
This is arts, the arts.

27:28.166 --> 27:29.006
Well, that's right.

27:29.026 --> 27:30.428
Well, then, but you've affected.

27:30.468 --> 27:32.570
Yeah, I agree.

27:35.093 --> 27:35.193
Okay.

27:35.213 --> 27:38.256
This is a painter.

27:39.164 --> 27:48.114
We needed to have explanations of how the proportions are drawn.

27:49.876 --> 28:05.273
So this is a two-volume collection on how to design Tibetan things you do in paintings where the painter can copy this to put into his paintings.

28:08.763 --> 28:10.625
So again, this comes from a teacher, doesn't it?

28:10.645 --> 28:10.825
Yeah.

28:10.885 --> 28:13.668
These have to be very precisely rendered.

28:14.729 --> 28:24.638
Right.

28:26.800 --> 28:34.087
Then we had them do how to make mandalas, you know, these psychosomatic mandalas.

28:34.107 --> 28:34.527
Okay.

28:34.667 --> 28:35.908
Psycho-cosmic diet.

28:35.928 --> 28:37.690
Psycho-cosmic diet, correct.

28:43.930 --> 28:51.139
So if you write out what it should look like, like this, you'll see it, and then you'll know what to type.

28:51.159 --> 28:54.543
Oh, it's a mandala, M-A-N-D-A-L-A-S, right?

28:54.623 --> 28:58.147
And what we have, this is how the mandala, the final mandala looks.

28:58.227 --> 29:02.633
So if you want to write, Mane Padme Hoon.

29:09.061 --> 29:09.501
Okay, good.

29:11.443 --> 29:12.705
And then we have him,

29:13.090 --> 29:15.152
Take the text.

29:15.392 --> 29:19.035
And now you know how you should type a student where the vowels should know.

29:19.056 --> 29:21.538
And it's in verse, you see.

29:21.558 --> 29:24.661
And then this explains what each of these terms means.

29:24.861 --> 29:29.545
Because we don't know the names.

29:31.307 --> 29:33.108
So you see how you lay it out.

29:33.749 --> 29:37.412
So it's really a manual, isn't it?

29:37.432 --> 29:37.653
A manual.

29:37.673 --> 29:38.774
Yeah, it's a manual.

29:38.834 --> 29:40.195
How to create it.

29:40.816 --> 29:42.318
We've published it.

29:42.338 --> 29:46.365
We've published a number of arguments like this.

29:46.445 --> 29:48.608
So what does the original one date from, would you say?

29:48.628 --> 29:51.152
The original date's from the last century.

29:51.172 --> 29:53.436
Oh, so this is a fairly recent thing, yeah.

29:53.496 --> 29:59.145
Well, the 19th century, you mean, yeah.

29:59.165 --> 30:02.690
Here's something interesting.

30:02.731 --> 30:04.173
This is the text we did.

30:04.293 --> 30:07.498
Illustrated Tibeto-Mongolian

30:07.732 --> 30:14.479
Materia Medica of Ayurveda.

30:14.499 --> 30:21.807
And then you would have these colors, the block print like we had.

30:21.827 --> 30:36.523
And it was a collaboration between me and the head of the Buryat, Buryat Russian Church, and Lokes Chandras, so India,

30:37.010 --> 30:40.554
One more example.

30:40.574 --> 30:41.916
1971, so I moved to Delhi.

30:42.416 --> 30:46.180
And the idea was to get this all done.

30:46.200 --> 30:47.622
I sort of laid it out.

30:48.683 --> 30:50.705
It's got pictures in it.

30:51.066 --> 30:51.807
Can you read that?

30:53.569 --> 30:55.131
Of Yetis.

30:56.752 --> 30:57.533
That's a Yeti.

30:57.834 --> 30:58.675
A Yeti being?

30:59.135 --> 31:00.837
These are these abominable snowmen?

31:01.518 --> 31:03.540
Yeah, sure.

31:04.280 --> 31:10.430
And this is how these different animals are used in medical practice.

31:12.253 --> 31:27.418
So this one is useful because it's to clear impurities of the bile.

31:28.833 --> 31:31.417
So, you know, it's broad.

31:32.118 --> 31:35.564
There's a great hero to that called the Geysar.

31:35.644 --> 31:36.866
Geysar is the epicure.

31:37.026 --> 31:37.908
It comes from Kaisar.

31:39.390 --> 31:45.540
And all those books over there have to do with Geysar, or guess the hero.

31:49.206 --> 31:50.669
How do we spell that again?

31:51.230 --> 31:53.794
G-E-N-S-A-R.

32:03.022 --> 32:07.807
So the collection is basically about twelve thousand volumes.

32:08.848 --> 32:22.722
Here is one we published in Bhutan with the director of the National Library and Rolstein, who was professor of the Collège de France and the World's Authority on KSAR.

32:24.064 --> 32:29.029
And he wrote the introduction, which is in the first volume.

32:30.055 --> 32:36.162
This is the text of this epic, this particular episode.

32:36.523 --> 32:39.867
Now, I don't want to ask a stupid question, but do we read left to right?

32:40.107 --> 32:40.888
Yeah.

32:40.908 --> 32:41.188
Always.

32:42.149 --> 32:50.239
Just like we do.

32:51.080 --> 32:55.405
All of this, there's 32 volumes of it.

32:56.465 --> 33:00.049
Thirty-two volumes, which you published.

33:00.310 --> 33:03.633
Yeah.

33:06.657 --> 33:07.078
Here it is.

33:13.165 --> 33:26.100
And this is something that tells about the—and then Professor Stein wrote the introduction to it.

33:27.515 --> 33:29.077
in English.

33:29.477 --> 33:32.221
Now, are these available in the libraries around here?

33:32.261 --> 33:33.162
Around, yes.

33:36.666 --> 33:38.148
All these volumes are available.

33:38.908 --> 33:43.714
This is Stein writing on it.

33:44.755 --> 33:46.698
Can I ask you another question?

33:47.438 --> 33:48.780
Now that you're going digital,

33:49.402 --> 33:54.892
Does that mean you no longer think that you'll be doing the hard copies of the books?

33:54.912 --> 33:56.855
No, it will continue to happen.

33:57.156 --> 33:58.559
That's probably very important to you.

33:58.579 --> 34:04.089
It's very important, because the digital is a preservation media.

34:05.030 --> 34:07.435
I mean, obviously— And that does everything.

34:07.475 --> 34:08.777
I mean, he wouldn't want to read.

34:09.938 --> 34:11.440
a book in on the screen.

34:11.760 --> 34:13.282
It's like microfilm of newspapers.

34:13.342 --> 34:13.622
Sure.

34:13.642 --> 34:16.586
It's a pain in the neck, but it's necessary, and it does do everything.

34:16.626 --> 34:20.971
But selectively, you'll continue to do the hard copies.

34:21.872 --> 34:36.909
This is Professor Stein writing on the Epoch of G-E-S-A-R volume, and that was done in, you said, 30 volumes?

34:37.470 --> 34:38.451
32 volumes.

34:38.491 --> 34:39.152
32 volumes.

34:39.520 --> 34:41.904
Here is his first publication.

34:43.686 --> 34:45.489
R. A. Stein, S-T-E-I.

34:45.549 --> 34:45.649
Rolf.

34:45.709 --> 34:46.631
Alfred Stein.

34:46.651 --> 34:46.871
Rolf.

34:47.893 --> 34:49.796
He was a professor of the College de France.

34:50.356 --> 34:53.481
He passed away a year and a half ago.

34:54.242 --> 34:56.766
He was a teacher of us all.

34:59.270 --> 35:03.436
There, here's another one.

35:03.456 --> 35:05.159
He's worked on the ethic.

35:05.179 --> 35:07.182
Could you have a rough idea of how many

35:08.377 --> 35:14.424
volumes that you have assisted in the publication of?

35:15.585 --> 35:17.967
Peter and I were just trying to talk about the bumbo last night.

35:18.027 --> 35:21.011
He thinks about four hundred, right?

35:22.492 --> 35:22.592
Yeah.

35:22.612 --> 35:23.974
You think only four hundred bumbo?

35:25.015 --> 35:30.421
No, the more the book, more books, but we published it so far, I think four hundred, something like that.

35:30.441 --> 35:30.821
I'm not quite sure.

35:31.742 --> 35:32.603
But about four hundred.

35:32.944 --> 35:35.286
That's just one tradition.

35:35.306 --> 35:36.207
One different.

35:37.081 --> 35:39.644
But all of these were done under the same program.

35:40.144 --> 35:42.206
So how many would you think, roughly?

35:42.226 --> 35:46.070
Well, I think we did probably close to 8,000 volumes.

35:46.110 --> 35:47.992
8,000 that you published?

35:48.193 --> 35:49.654
Yeah.

35:49.674 --> 35:50.655
Well, that's extraordinary.

35:51.756 --> 35:55.340
Well, it's just encouraging them to publish them.

35:55.360 --> 35:56.321
I didn't publish them.

35:56.341 --> 36:03.068
Well, yeah, but you've been more or less the midwife to the— When you say them, who's them?

36:03.589 --> 36:06.632
Pedro, his friends.

36:07.355 --> 36:13.821
We just came and brought the books to us, and then we said, if you publish this, it's worthwhile.

36:14.942 --> 36:21.369
And then they'd take it back, and they would go, and they would arrange for the publication.

36:21.529 --> 36:24.031
They would make a profit, naturally, if everybody had no profit.

36:24.051 --> 36:29.377
Of course, you don't have to apologize for that.

36:29.397 --> 36:34.982
And then they would then

36:35.468 --> 36:37.651
bring them to us and we would buy copies.

36:37.671 --> 36:40.714
So these are largely being published in other countries?

36:41.315 --> 36:41.615
Yeah.

36:42.596 --> 36:43.437
For example, this.

36:44.579 --> 36:46.060
This is an encyclopedia.

36:48.383 --> 36:50.365
And I can see it's many, many volumes.

36:50.866 --> 36:54.150
Yeah, 140.

36:54.170 --> 36:55.592
140 volumes.

36:55.612 --> 37:00.137
And what would the generic name of this encyclopedia be?

37:00.157 --> 37:03.621
Encyclopedia Tibetica.

37:03.641 --> 37:05.323
Dating from approximately when?

37:05.523 --> 37:09.288
The Guide Loads, 1376 to 1451.

37:10.930 --> 37:11.311
Wow.

37:12.172 --> 37:13.573
And when were these copies printed?

37:13.634 --> 37:16.838
These copies are already decaying.

37:16.858 --> 37:21.864
They were printed in 1975, 1974.

37:21.904 --> 37:22.705
Did you work in these?

37:23.086 --> 37:24.428
Yeah.

37:24.448 --> 37:25.329
And where were they printed?

37:25.930 --> 37:27.912
They were printed in India, 1970.

37:27.932 --> 37:28.333
1970.

37:28.653 --> 37:32.458
So it's Encyclopedia—we'll take a photograph— that's Encyclopedia Tibetica.

37:34.666 --> 37:40.151
And then I did an index to it.

37:40.531 --> 37:42.733
And I did introductions.

37:42.753 --> 37:47.918
And it's already degrading.

37:48.378 --> 37:48.558
Yeah.

37:49.859 --> 37:51.601
So this was ascetic paper.

37:51.621 --> 37:53.623
This is prior to the knowledge that we were— Yeah.

37:55.344 --> 38:04.032
See, these are— And this was published—can I even see the—

38:05.075 --> 38:05.436
No.

38:06.958 --> 38:08.720
To Beth House, so I think I did get a picture of this.

38:08.740 --> 38:09.902
So this is 69, even.

38:12.185 --> 38:12.286
Yeah.

38:12.586 --> 38:12.926
Wow.

38:16.351 --> 38:19.696
So can you tell me a little bit about this encyclopedia?

38:19.917 --> 38:28.008
This was an extraordinarily great scholar who said he wanted to gather together all of knowledge.

38:28.890 --> 38:29.611
All of knowledge.

38:29.631 --> 38:34.558
He called it the Deni, the reality dupa put together.

38:34.960 --> 38:38.344
So he then arranged it.

38:39.045 --> 38:41.769
Unfortunately, we don't have all of it left.

38:42.570 --> 38:48.037
Many volumes have been lost when they left Tibet.

38:48.077 --> 38:50.140
And his tradition is very small.

38:50.440 --> 38:52.723
Are we talking about the 50s now?

38:52.743 --> 38:54.265
Yeah, this was in 59 when they left.

38:55.927 --> 38:57.149
So material was lost?

38:57.209 --> 39:01.795
Yeah, the volumes were lost when they brought them across the border.

39:02.821 --> 39:05.784
But do you think that any of it still survives over there?

39:05.804 --> 39:06.805
We may find it.

39:08.547 --> 39:16.595
Now, His Holiness the Dalai Lama is very keen on having this reprinted because now it's out of print.

39:17.156 --> 39:19.638
It's out of print and it's on paper that's decaying.

39:19.679 --> 39:19.899
Yeah.

39:20.519 --> 39:27.507
So the Dalai Lama ordered Tibet House, the Venerable Dobrum Rinpoche, to reprint it.

39:29.208 --> 39:31.731
He directed them or he ordered them?

39:32.420 --> 39:34.763
And we have been collaborating.

39:35.003 --> 39:38.587
We are providing them the digital scans.

39:39.728 --> 39:39.868
Uh-huh.

39:39.888 --> 39:42.471
From these plates or whatever, these pages.

39:43.092 --> 39:43.192
Yeah.

39:43.212 --> 39:44.974
We scanned it, the entire.

39:44.994 --> 39:49.960
And then they will print it as a book, as books.

39:49.980 --> 39:50.541
Wow.

39:50.561 --> 39:56.868
And when do you think that is... Well, they're having a lot of... We're adding things to it.

39:57.288 --> 40:00.672
We're adding checks that have turned up since that time.

40:00.922 --> 40:02.023
That's a great story.

40:02.224 --> 40:20.525
And the ranking Lady Lama of Tibet, who is the consort and the chi-head of the tradition, is a woman called the Diamond Sao, or the Dorje Pamo.

40:22.167 --> 40:23.869
And she is collaborating.

40:24.831 --> 40:29.376
She wants this done, because it represents her tradition.

40:30.419 --> 40:34.806
So copies of this will go into Tibet.

40:34.826 --> 40:41.217
What I'm looking at is probably fifteen linear feet, maybe, that's a guess.

40:41.237 --> 40:42.118
One person wrote this?

40:42.639 --> 40:44.302
Yeah.

40:44.322 --> 40:45.804
One person wrote all of this.

40:47.827 --> 40:48.709
That's extraordinary.

40:49.350 --> 40:55.600
It's called Bodong Panchen, the great Pandita of Bodong, Chole Namgyal.

40:56.457 --> 40:59.300
I want to write that down before I transcribe this.

40:59.340 --> 41:03.646
I mean, if I do a little search on this, I might be able to find a reference on it, do you think?

41:08.131 --> 41:09.393
My notebook's downstairs.

41:10.634 --> 41:22.749
You just said it took us a long time to do this, right?

41:23.229 --> 41:25.452
When did you start the actual work on it?

41:26.596 --> 41:27.817
Prior to publication?

41:28.018 --> 41:33.043
Yeah, in 1968.

41:33.083 --> 41:33.143
58.

41:33.163 --> 41:33.243
68.

41:33.564 --> 41:36.867
68, but that's when you started publishing in 68 as well.

41:36.987 --> 41:39.050
Yeah, but we had to do that.

41:39.070 --> 41:40.792
We were doing each volume.

41:40.812 --> 41:42.173
So these were copied from?

41:42.814 --> 41:44.396
Manuscripts.

41:44.416 --> 41:45.897
Had they ever been in print before?

41:45.917 --> 41:46.278
No.

41:46.298 --> 41:47.919
This is the first printed edition.

41:48.060 --> 41:49.481
First printed edition of them.

41:49.501 --> 41:50.923
Well, it's an amazing story.

41:51.043 --> 41:53.165
Yeah.

41:53.185 --> 41:55.708
They go all the way over to there, and then come all the way back.

41:55.925 --> 41:58.308
I'm going to take a picture of that.

41:58.828 --> 42:02.853
I think that's pretty darn interesting, I have to say.

42:03.333 --> 42:08.019
I don't think that's good for me to be in a picture with the book so much lower than me.

42:08.039 --> 42:10.161
All right, why don't I just take a picture out on that?

42:13.885 --> 42:15.307
Okay, you're not in that picture at all.

42:18.991 --> 42:19.972
I think this is great.

42:20.673 --> 42:22.455
And when are you leaving, Gene?

42:22.621 --> 42:23.782
You don't know approximately?

42:23.922 --> 42:35.953
I'll leave you alone for the next couple of weeks then, and when you're resettled— Yeah, come down to New York.

42:35.973 --> 42:51.548
I'd like you to meet—there's a rather remarkable project that he's doing, which I'd like you to—we're going to have him help us in New York, but the Boone Foundation is a group of

42:52.085 --> 43:02.899
Americans who are trying to help them preserve in India their traditional literary culture.

43:03.460 --> 43:10.169
This is a small tradition, but they have huge numbers of volumes, and they're slowly coming out.

43:10.289 --> 43:22.024
We just have received—you can't see them because they're in the basement—the Bunbo canon, that's the works of their Lord Buddha.

43:22.662 --> 43:24.343
How many volumes are there, Kater?

43:25.825 --> 43:28.427
I think there are two hundred twenty-five volumes.

43:28.487 --> 43:30.108
Two hundred twenty-five volumes.

43:30.128 --> 43:32.470
And about three hundred volumes in Egypt.

43:32.490 --> 43:34.112
And three hundred volumes is a tinger.

43:34.792 --> 43:40.317
So he's going to have his work cut out for him, because I want him to scan all of this.

43:40.337 --> 43:40.497
Wow.

43:42.078 --> 43:45.141
So he's here in the States.

43:47.223 --> 43:52.467
He was involved in making Tibetan books for a very long time.

43:52.953 --> 43:58.959
And there's the key to that.

43:59.920 --> 44:02.263
That's great.

44:02.323 --> 44:03.224
Does it work?

44:03.264 --> 44:04.565
We should leave him alone.

44:04.686 --> 44:12.694
Did you manage to get the, did you get, you can see with the acrobat?

44:12.714 --> 44:14.856
Yeah, yeah.

44:14.877 --> 44:15.397
You want to see?

44:15.677 --> 44:17.139
No, no, no.

44:17.159 --> 44:19.762
So was this, can I ask you a question about the encyclopedia again?

44:19.922 --> 44:22.825
We should leave him alone.

44:24.813 --> 44:30.739
You obviously knew all about this encyclopedia, but it was a manuscript thing.

44:30.759 --> 44:36.766
Now these volumes, were these organized by you and your colleagues?

44:37.487 --> 44:39.469
No, they're still not organized.

44:39.489 --> 44:42.832
This is not necessarily the sequence that they were written in, right?

44:42.852 --> 44:43.093
No.

44:44.354 --> 44:54.685
So this was kind of an arbitrary thing that you people— Yeah, now they're trying to put it together in a proper way.

44:55.120 --> 44:56.181
Here we have this Gantt.

44:56.502 --> 44:57.703
And these were preserved.

44:57.723 --> 44:58.924
Let me go get my notebook, okay?

44:58.945 --> 44:59.525
I'll be right back.

45:03.910 --> 45:07.174
...on this particular set.

45:07.194 --> 45:13.942
But we've provided it to Beth House for the reprinting.

45:14.162 --> 45:15.424
Now this is the encyclopedia.

45:17.326 --> 45:17.667
Yeah.

45:22.232 --> 45:23.153
So here...

45:30.575 --> 45:48.943
For example, here's one volume.

45:48.963 --> 45:49.304
See, there it is.

45:49.324 --> 45:49.924
Just scan it from there, copy.

45:49.944 --> 45:50.305
This is volume 90.

45:55.229 --> 45:58.213
Would you like to print me just one title page, one of those?

45:58.774 --> 45:59.014
Sure.

45:59.054 --> 46:00.696
That way I'll know I'll have the spelling right.

46:02.218 --> 46:05.702
And just don't personally print the whole thing.

46:05.722 --> 46:06.143
Just print one thing.

46:06.163 --> 46:08.746
Yes, Mac.

46:08.766 --> 46:10.609
Otherwise, I'll be getting the whole encyclopedia.

46:11.430 --> 46:14.914
I don't think you will have that.

46:14.934 --> 46:15.054
Print.

46:15.815 --> 46:16.777
Just say page.

46:16.797 --> 46:17.878
Current page.

46:17.898 --> 46:18.679
There you go.

46:18.799 --> 46:23.245
Okay, and we'll print it on the one out there because this one's jammed.

46:29.114 --> 46:37.747
I think we're pretty good.

46:37.947 --> 46:46.861
I think I have to go back and absorb some of this stuff, and I'll probably go to work on transferring myself tonight.

46:47.582 --> 46:56.455
Well, anything we can do to help you is a great project, and it might help us with food.

46:57.532 --> 47:06.240
We have been curiously lacking in support from the... They think we're too much Buddhists.

47:07.081 --> 47:13.047
The big granting agents like Rockefeller, Ford, Mellon.

47:14.769 --> 47:21.855
They give us a flight, no, but we're told that it's because we are a Buddhist organization.

47:21.875 --> 47:23.457
What's the animus towards that?

47:23.557 --> 47:25.699
No, it's just that they don't give to

47:26.185 --> 47:26.766
religious.

47:26.966 --> 47:28.889
I see.

47:28.909 --> 47:29.610
Hello, you're here!

47:29.630 --> 47:30.852
Dr. Sick.

47:31.693 --> 47:32.274
Dr. Sick.

47:33.015 --> 47:34.096
You're back.

47:34.116 --> 47:36.039
Hey, great!

47:36.079 --> 47:37.942
We were going to go and have lunch.

47:37.962 --> 47:38.703
Can you have lunch?

47:38.743 --> 47:39.284
Yeah, sure.

47:39.804 --> 47:45.272
I thought we'd... I thought we'd go and have a Korean place.

47:49.518 --> 47:49.699
I'll set.

47:49.819 --> 47:52.142
But you're telling me just briefly on the... I mean, I'll set.

47:52.561 --> 47:54.543
No, no, no.

47:54.703 --> 48:01.410
I mean, I'm all set in terms of—you said that you're having trouble getting funding because you've received it.

48:01.470 --> 48:03.352
Yeah, because we're received as being two Buddhists.

48:03.372 --> 48:07.556
We're trying to write down our— But that's where we got the funding.

48:07.576 --> 48:19.328
Yeah, we get our funding from the Buddhists, but when we try to apply to foundations like Freeman, Ford,

48:22.919 --> 48:28.386
Rockefeller, they give us flight.

48:29.748 --> 48:39.019
Well, we weren't really, we were still a start-up, but I think they feel that we're, they don't want to fund religious organizations.

48:39.039 --> 48:42.263
But you're not a religious organization.

48:42.283 --> 48:42.383
No.

48:42.404 --> 48:43.805
I think we should state that, then.

48:43.925 --> 48:45.668
Yeah, I think you should.

48:46.228 --> 48:49.412
You know, we're, I mean, you should state it.

48:49.432 --> 48:49.973
We're not.

48:50.847 --> 48:54.893
And we're simply trying to preserve the culture.

48:57.076 --> 49:09.974
And the beneficiaries are not only the universities, but will also be the lineage holders, the translators, the Buddhists.

49:10.735 --> 49:18.766
But we want to provide things to everyone, because that's the whole idea.

49:18.786 --> 49:19.707
That's a great story.

49:20.716 --> 49:28.525
The 137 volume encyclopedia of Bodong.

49:28.705 --> 49:36.273
The first printed edition that she did, that Jane did, in the 1960s in Delhi.

49:36.373 --> 49:40.098
And because it's on acidic paint, but just getting that stuff out.

49:40.238 --> 49:44.442
Was that basically brought out by pilgrims, nomads?

49:44.462 --> 49:44.903
No.

49:45.403 --> 49:49.508
There was a group, a very strong group of people called the

49:50.045 --> 49:53.250
community, and they're still very active.

49:53.270 --> 49:53.751
On the fringes.

49:54.152 --> 49:54.753
On the fringes.

49:54.793 --> 49:56.696
They're still way out in the west.

49:56.716 --> 49:58.279
In the middle of nowhere, literally.

49:58.299 --> 49:58.499
Yeah.

49:59.380 --> 50:00.763
And they had these books.

50:01.624 --> 50:04.609
And they had, I think... They were manuscript copies.

50:04.629 --> 50:07.454
Were they unique copies of this, do you think?

50:07.474 --> 50:14.625
Did this only exist in a few... I think there must have been copies at the Jura Monastery and at Samdi.

50:15.306 --> 50:15.647
But they're gone.

50:16.336 --> 50:18.798
They're gone.

50:19.138 --> 50:21.240
So they were destroyed.

50:21.260 --> 50:24.483
Yeah, so what happened?

50:24.503 --> 50:27.686
That's a major accomplishment, isn't it?

50:30.709 --> 50:36.354
They hauled the stuff across the border, on yaks, into Nepal.

50:37.354 --> 50:44.841
And two or three yaks and their loads fell into the water and were drowned.

50:45.091 --> 50:53.782
And you see, the thing is, we don't know the code to the way the thing is structured.

50:54.924 --> 50:55.284
Not yet.

50:56.406 --> 51:01.072
So this remains a work in progress.

51:01.132 --> 51:03.735
It's exciting if you're a scholar in this area.

51:03.755 --> 51:07.360
This is untouched in some territory.

51:07.840 --> 51:10.304
And it's divided into sections.

51:11.305 --> 51:12.246
And I think there were

51:12.547 --> 51:23.557
There probably are two sets of the Din Dupa Gepa in there, the big one, which is 110 volumes.

51:23.577 --> 51:28.262
Plus there must have been a set of the Dringbo.

51:28.562 --> 51:33.967
And you found a block print of the Shintu Dupa in the British Library.

51:33.987 --> 51:40.613
That's a 15th-century block print.

51:40.897 --> 51:44.181
Yeah, but the great one was never blocked, Leonard.

51:44.201 --> 51:45.363
Too big.

51:45.383 --> 51:49.488
It was too big, and the copies are very badly blocked.

51:49.508 --> 51:51.491
And the Boudoir didn't have that money.

51:51.511 --> 51:58.520
They didn't have the economic wherewithal to have it, but never, because they're all in the fringes, because it's pretty perfect.

51:58.540 --> 52:03.746
All right, but do you know enough about this person who did the encyclopedia?

52:03.766 --> 52:04.828
Oh, yeah.

52:05.929 --> 52:08.052
And Leonard Saund in Beijing,

52:09.263 --> 52:18.333
the biography of his consort, who must have been quite an interesting woman.

52:20.616 --> 52:34.512
She was the princess of the house of the royal family of Gungang, and she was taken first as a consort by Bodong, and then she became the consort of

52:35.032 --> 52:41.559
the great engineer of Tibetan history, the maker of iron bridges, Hong Kong Yellow.

52:41.579 --> 52:47.666
And she then fostered a lineage of incarnations.

52:48.266 --> 52:51.310
Well, she didn't incarnate, the only one which had it.

52:52.371 --> 52:53.892
Yeah, well, probably more.

52:54.553 --> 53:02.862
And this monastery was located, and it was headed, it was a monastery, but it was headed by a

53:03.398 --> 53:09.246
a female incarnate Lama called Assamding Garjupamo.

53:10.788 --> 53:24.205
And she is the eighth or tenth of a detective today.

53:25.366 --> 53:30.974
And preserving Buddhist her own culture.

53:31.014 --> 53:32.916
These things are very complex.

53:33.385 --> 53:37.869
And that's a great sentence.

53:37.889 --> 53:40.652
You know, I'm always looking for the way I start it and the way I end it.

53:41.593 --> 53:42.394
That's the kicker.

53:42.734 --> 53:44.937
That's the final sentence that you use in the chapter.

53:44.977 --> 53:49.721
These things are very complex.

53:49.741 --> 53:51.503
No, I'm always looking for how I start it.

53:51.523 --> 53:52.724
People say, do you have your lead?

53:53.365 --> 53:55.787
I say, I never leave an interview until I know how I'm starting it.

53:56.228 --> 53:58.250
And also, if I know how I'm ending it.

53:58.290 --> 53:59.511
I hadn't seen the kicker yet.

53:59.761 --> 54:01.323
And there it is, right there.

54:01.343 --> 54:03.845
These things are very complex.

54:03.865 --> 54:04.566
No kidding.

54:04.586 --> 54:07.409
That's fabulous.

54:07.429 --> 54:24.588
She's very active, and she actually met a set of these books being brought to the airport in Lanza with a band, the Gialing.

54:24.628 --> 54:25.769
The photocopies.

54:25.789 --> 54:29.633
Who made the photocopies?

54:30.102 --> 54:31.764
They were made by a soldier.

54:32.045 --> 54:33.306
This was the entire set?

54:33.547 --> 54:35.169
The entire set.

54:35.470 --> 54:35.650
Wow.

54:35.790 --> 54:47.707
Took them by plane to the airport, and then the Samding doji promo met her and conducted her to Samding.

54:47.727 --> 54:48.187
Wow.

54:50.210 --> 54:53.795
And this woman is trying to restore this tradition.

54:56.419 --> 54:57.240
But, you know, it's

54:58.199 --> 55:02.383
I don't think we'll ever find the rest of it.

55:02.403 --> 55:03.284
But you saved most of it.

55:04.165 --> 55:06.026
Yeah, well, I don't think we have.

55:06.046 --> 55:07.348
Maybe in Potala.

55:07.368 --> 55:07.868
Maybe what?

55:08.088 --> 55:08.709
In the Potala.

55:08.729 --> 55:10.791
There are untold treasures there.

55:10.811 --> 55:12.552
Untold treasures.

55:12.572 --> 55:13.994
And where is this?

55:14.074 --> 55:14.434
Potala.

55:14.454 --> 55:16.116
The Potala.

55:16.136 --> 55:16.896
But who knows?

55:17.177 --> 55:21.681
We hope that more will survive, will come out.

55:23.242 --> 55:27.126
I've been looking for it for years.

55:28.642 --> 55:43.434
I mean, there's things in it that—you know, a translation of the story of Sita from the Ramayana.

55:43.454 --> 55:51.561
Are there any published texts that you can recommend that will tell me something about this encyclopedia, or is it just a—there's a breadth of stuff written on it?

55:51.581 --> 55:54.103
No, I don't think that's what it is.

55:54.203 --> 55:58.547
So when I write about this, people aren't going to be able to go to Google and do a search and find anything.

55:58.949 --> 56:10.180
Because there's so much literature, and so, well, the few of us are interested in intellectual culture and intellectual culture, and the history of the Aedesians, and that, no, you don't find it.

56:10.200 --> 56:11.661
You are fine, but don't mind.

56:11.981 --> 56:12.262
Right.

56:12.442 --> 56:18.508
Yeah, I'm just teasing, but I mean, like Jay's story, have there been any kind of scholarly articles, journal articles?

56:18.528 --> 56:19.589
No, for some reason not.

56:19.609 --> 56:23.032
And how do you judge this person as a cultural?

56:23.052 --> 56:24.173
Just biography.

56:24.193 --> 56:24.613
Say what?

56:24.633 --> 56:28.517
There is biography with him, I used to disciple a lot of biography,

56:28.936 --> 56:30.779
Those of us who read the biography.

56:31.680 --> 56:33.402
So there is a biography written of him?

56:33.443 --> 56:36.727
Yes, internet.

56:36.747 --> 56:37.028
Thanks a lot.

56:37.048 --> 56:40.252
Which is based in terms of two or three other biographies.

56:40.433 --> 56:41.915
Which you didn't photograph.

56:42.355 --> 56:44.839
I know they were in a long time.

56:44.899 --> 56:46.842
I didn't get a hold of them.

56:47.403 --> 56:49.606
I worked in Nepal for five years.

56:49.706 --> 56:53.912
He was doing preservation in Nepal.

56:53.932 --> 56:56.496
Doing much, much more than I was.

56:56.813 --> 57:06.892
Anyway, this woman, this Japanese woman, I've been in touch with Ayako to see if we could find those.

57:06.912 --> 57:10.939
I want to publish those two biographies that she saw.

57:11.460 --> 57:11.901
She has them?

57:12.602 --> 57:12.823
No.

57:13.123 --> 57:16.449
She says that she can get them.

57:16.469 --> 57:19.615
This is a young, or she's not young anymore, she says.

57:20.590 --> 57:24.456
Japanese woman, she's married to a photographer.

57:24.476 --> 57:27.079
She's still passionately interested.

57:30.204 --> 57:38.035
But if we could get it and send them to India for reproduction, we can increase the size of the collection.

57:38.436 --> 57:43.223
How many copies of that encyclopedia were printed, do you think?

57:43.623 --> 57:46.487
Probably a hundred, maybe?

57:46.507 --> 57:47.909
Do you think that's any?

57:47.929 --> 57:49.011
Maybe less, I don't know.

57:49.345 --> 57:53.732
I mean, how many are there in the States at the East, maybe 10?

57:53.752 --> 57:54.653
Tui Bunker has maybe one.

57:56.516 --> 57:59.721
Nobody in China has one until in India.

57:59.761 --> 58:02.385
So this is a very rare book.

58:02.425 --> 58:03.386
It's still rare.

58:03.406 --> 58:05.830
Even the printed edition is very rare.

58:07.613 --> 58:14.543
And he was telling me that the Dalai Lama ordered the reprinting of this.

58:15.198 --> 58:18.782
first printed edition.

58:19.743 --> 58:24.208
He showed me the files here.

58:25.569 --> 58:32.957
I'd love to have a copy.

58:32.977 --> 58:35.120
It would seem to me there are a lot of Ph.D.

58:35.160 --> 58:38.083
theses that could be written there.

58:39.312 --> 58:42.277
Yeah, but 137 volumes would be one more than one.

58:42.918 --> 58:50.251
She calls him a... She has in one Bush student, who called him a sexist pig.

58:50.272 --> 58:51.053
No, not quite.
