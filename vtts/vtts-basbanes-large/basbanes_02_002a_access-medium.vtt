00:05.583 --> 00:30.038
They received reviews on the order of a writer to watch.

00:30.541 --> 00:38.329
But when Kennedy turned in his next novel, Iron Weed, his publisher had lost patience waiting for the writer to watch to turn into a writer who sells.

00:38.950 --> 00:44.455
When it was finally published, Iron Weed went on to win the National Book Critics Circle Award for best novel.

00:44.976 --> 00:47.158
All three Albany novels were optioned for film.

00:47.599 --> 00:56.768
The MacArthur Foundation awarded Kennedy one of its fairy godmother grants, $264,000 over five years, so that Kennedy could write in peace.

00:57.203 --> 01:01.829
Francis Ford Coppola called, asking if Kennedy would help on the dialogue for the movie The Cotton Club.

01:02.510 --> 01:10.801
There's a sweet justice here for the author who was told, in rejection letter after rejection letter, who wants to read about bums, and especially bums in Albany?

01:11.362 --> 01:12.163
A lot of us do.

01:13.585 --> 01:18.631
We, of course, want to talk about your wonderful novels, but before we do, I can't resist.

01:19.072 --> 01:23.818
I have to ask you, if you may, to describe your...

01:24.035 --> 01:30.302
first meeting Saul Bellow down in Puerto Rico, even to describe the school where he was teaching.

01:30.342 --> 01:37.050
I just would love to hear the tale of you handing in fiction to Bellow and what he said to you.

01:38.411 --> 01:48.162
Well, he was advertised in creative writing, and I submitted a partial novel.

01:49.103 --> 01:50.565
I'm called the Angels.

01:56.215 --> 01:58.716
Thalen was created, the Thalen family.

01:59.894 --> 02:05.601
And the fellow read it and took me in as a student before I had met him.

02:05.882 --> 02:13.691
And then we gathered, and he just sat around, and he said something about writing in general.

02:13.772 --> 02:18.477
And he said, a writer one day wakes up and anoints himself as a writer.

02:18.497 --> 02:25.186
And I thought that was a wonderful phrase, you know, to commit yourself to it.

02:26.167 --> 02:28.450
It's a lifetime.

02:28.430 --> 02:33.416
project as an attitude towards the rest of your life.

02:33.436 --> 02:39.224
The first thing he read was very, very encouraging to me and told me it was publishable.

02:39.244 --> 02:44.050
Nobody had ever said anything remotely like that about anything I'd written.

02:44.311 --> 02:50.999
And so we went on and I had faith in that book and did finish it.

02:51.019 --> 02:52.081
It was never published.

02:52.141 --> 02:54.264
It was a very downbeat book.

02:54.844 --> 02:57.728
And it was a

02:58.703 --> 03:19.359
less a novel than it was a collection of stories about various family members, but it had some power, and I think I'll resurrect a bit of it, maybe for a short story.

03:19.379 --> 03:20.982
Anyway, it confirms

03:21.164 --> 03:33.431
that I was going to be a writer, because I was able to finish the book, and the responses I got along the way, I realized there was something there beyond amateur nighting.

03:34.233 --> 03:38.683
And so, you know, in another year or so, I...

03:38.933 --> 03:49.230
I quit journalism and went full-time writing fiction, and that was 1961, and I haven't had a job since.

03:50.332 --> 03:51.294
What's opening once?

03:51.314 --> 03:53.016
Why did you go back?

03:53.958 --> 03:55.921
What would you have lost?

03:58.165 --> 04:00.068
I didn't really intend to stay when I went back.

04:00.489 --> 04:03.574
My father was sick, and my mother had died.

04:07.233 --> 04:10.076
He didn't see a doctor.

04:10.417 --> 04:11.438
So we got him straight.

04:12.760 --> 04:20.209
But he was getting to the point where it looked like he needed some help.

04:20.549 --> 04:23.513
And so we came back.

04:23.553 --> 04:29.460
And also, I had been in Puerto Rico for six years and Miami for a year.

04:30.014 --> 04:31.176
It was time.

04:31.557 --> 04:42.855
I felt it was time to come back into range of New York City or whatever and re-enter the mainland.

04:44.138 --> 04:49.526
But I did come back, and I figured I'd stay a year or two.

04:49.887 --> 04:54.655
I was still a part-time journalist trying to write novels.

04:55.765 --> 05:03.018
But then the very first assignment I got was to write a history of the city, a neighborhood history.

05:03.779 --> 05:11.693
And I started to interview all these people in their 80s and 90s, and it was just one wonderful story after another.

05:11.793 --> 05:17.082
And I began to see the patterns that existed and how my own neighborhood was structured.

05:17.838 --> 05:27.406
I began interviewing my father and my uncles and everybody, everybody I could, who had a memory that preceded my own, I would tap them.

05:27.446 --> 05:33.992
And I wrote that piece over about four months, and that really must have done something to me.

05:34.012 --> 05:41.759
I mean, I just, also, we had a great house we bought from the country, and it was such pleasant living.

05:41.799 --> 05:42.940
I didn't want to go anyplace, though.

05:43.420 --> 05:44.481
Talk about ironweed.

05:45.562 --> 05:46.883
Just ask it to.

05:48.365 --> 05:52.713
This is a continuation of the people in the situation.

05:55.518 --> 06:01.750
The book was, I thought it was more of a

06:02.894 --> 06:05.919
cohesive work than anything I'd done there for.

06:05.939 --> 06:12.108
I felt that I did what I set out to do in creating Francis.

06:12.289 --> 06:16.796
I got closer to him than I ever got to any other person or any other books I wrote.

06:17.837 --> 06:21.443
Your first two novels, there is a narrator

06:21.777 --> 06:32.191
like Jack Haraway in Great Gatsby or like Jack Burton in All the King's Men, who is a more educated, normal person to whom the reader can identify.

06:32.271 --> 06:38.840
He's like an interpreter or a guide for this netherworld of bums and whores and murderers.

06:38.860 --> 06:41.864
And in Iron Weed, the narrator is gone.

06:41.884 --> 06:48.673
We now have Francis Salem, self-described bums, and he is the sensibility through which we see this world.

06:48.793 --> 06:50.636
That was conscious.

06:50.696 --> 06:51.497
I wanted to...

06:51.899 --> 06:59.452
I wanted to explore the various levels of consciousness that I felt Francis was demanding.

06:59.472 --> 07:00.855
This came about.

07:00.895 --> 07:04.481
I didn't want another narrator to intervene in the story in the first place.

07:04.541 --> 07:09.470
I wanted to go right into his mind differently at that time.

07:09.490 --> 07:16.202
And then as I began to tell it, I started to use the best language at my disposal, and...

07:16.823 --> 07:27.513
gradually evolved into another facet of Francis' consciousness, or unconsciousness.

07:27.533 --> 07:41.425
His eloquence, such it is, that comes out of every human being, if you can only find it or have it.

07:41.445 --> 07:45.649
And I felt that when he was, when he sleeps in the barn,

07:46.996 --> 07:51.353
He's a hundred feet away from where he's gone.

07:52.480 --> 08:08.758
that the language there as he froze up to sleep, it began to be as good a thrust of the written word as I was capable of.

08:08.918 --> 08:22.133
Somebody like Legs Diamond, this marvelous gangster, this scion of Albany and all of its tawdry glory, he's basically involved

08:22.298 --> 08:47.023
uh all three times that he's almost shot to death uh in something like a spiritual quest if i understand you he's looking for a balance between what he might be and what he has to do he also uh you talked about the balance and that was one of the things in confronting him

08:49.703 --> 09:09.178
And yet at the same time, Diamond was a very cruel man and a very vicious man.

09:10.300 --> 09:11.563
Put her in some place.

09:11.583 --> 09:14.007
From very early time.

09:14.611 --> 09:43.116
And the balance that did prevail in his life, which was his kind of love of singing and sociality and his ability to balance the women in his life and really put them together, his wife and his girlfriend in the same hotel room, was indicative to me of this curious man who was more than the traditional gangster, which is why I finally was able to

09:43.484 --> 09:48.081
stay with him so long, because he did have that kind of complication.

09:48.101 --> 09:51.914
I kept saying to myself, why are you writing about your character?

09:51.935 --> 09:55.688
And all the way through the writing of that book took six years.

09:57.018 --> 10:03.844
And it was his complexity, finally, that really struck me.

10:03.984 --> 10:10.610
And I mean, he used to read Rabelette and give it away, give copies of Greg Andrew and Panic Rule to his friends.

10:12.011 --> 10:14.733
That's beyond why he did that.

10:14.753 --> 10:23.481
But as long as he did it, I believe that there was something to him which needed to be analyzed.

10:23.501 --> 10:26.063
And I analyzed him into life.

10:26.752 --> 10:28.234
I couldn't stand it anymore.

10:28.254 --> 10:30.498
I finally finished that book.

10:33.122 --> 10:35.466
All of your people believe in justice, too.

10:35.486 --> 10:38.711
They believe that they must make sense, moral sense of what they're doing.

10:39.472 --> 10:45.722
Well, Martin Doherty used a wonderful phrase when he says, talking to the editor of the paper, and says,

10:46.310 --> 10:49.034
It's not sarcasm, it's cynical humanism.

10:49.135 --> 10:50.717
And I thought, cynical humanism.

10:51.338 --> 10:53.682
Would you describe yourself as a cynical humanist?

10:53.702 --> 10:57.128
Somebody, I think, used that phrase back at me in one of the reviews recently.

10:57.148 --> 11:01.455
But it's a wonderful, a lot of people have been searching for something that would describe themselves.

11:03.037 --> 11:12.853
Well, I think that the quest for justice is very important to the people in the books.

11:12.893 --> 11:13.414
That's true.

11:14.423 --> 11:17.366
I think it's important to a lot of us.

11:17.386 --> 11:25.856
I think that's one of the motivating things about writing fiction, that you can make it work out.

11:26.137 --> 11:37.811
You know, you can rejuggle the universe and find a way of righting the wrongs and settling scores and so on.

11:37.911 --> 11:41.595
But I think it's a very...

11:41.575 --> 11:43.999
commonplace desire.

11:44.480 --> 11:53.415
One would hope it's a commonplace desire on the part of all citizens and all human beings, but to present it effectively as fiction as you've done is not at all commonplace.

11:53.435 --> 11:57.262
Thanks very much.

11:57.803 --> 12:00.748
William Kennedy reading from his novel Iron Weed.

12:02.180 --> 12:06.143
Francis decided this would be a fine place to be buried.

12:06.163 --> 12:16.512
If it had a nice flow to it, it carried you down the grass and out onto the river, and then across the water and up through the trees on the far shore to the top of the hill, all in one swoop.

12:18.134 --> 12:21.096
Being dead here would situate a man in place and time.

12:22.017 --> 12:28.102
It would give a man neighbors, even some of them really old folks, like those antique dead ones at the foot of the lawn.

12:29.023 --> 12:31.545
Tobias Banyan, Elisha Skinner,

12:32.099 --> 12:42.917
Elsie Whipple, all crumbling under their limestone headstones, from which the snows, sands, and acids of reduction were slowly removing their names.

12:42.937 --> 12:44.940
But what did the perpetuation of names matter?

12:45.862 --> 12:50.850
Ah, well, there were those for whom death, like life, would always be a burden of eminence.

12:51.674 --> 12:56.199
The progeny of those growing nameless at the foot of the hill were ensured a more durable memory.

12:56.880 --> 13:06.391
Their new and heavier marble stones higher up on the slope had been cut doubly deep so their names would remain visible for an eternity at least.

13:16.342 --> 13:21.107
A program like this appears to be dealing with artifacts or objects called books.

13:21.813 --> 13:27.368
But of course, it's really dealing with invisible essence, imagined people or ideas.
