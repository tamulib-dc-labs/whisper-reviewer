WEBVTT

00:01.752 --> 00:03.114
And we're rolling.

00:03.855 --> 00:05.097
We're talking to our own French.

00:06.259 --> 00:08.543
I guess a very interesting book.

00:09.504 --> 00:15.033
Would you describe this as a career, as a departure for you as a fiction writer?

00:15.674 --> 00:27.231
Well, when I began it, I thought it might be because I began it at a very low point in my life when I was extremely ill and did not expect to live.

00:28.153 --> 00:30.156
And I thought I was going to write a comic novel.

00:30.524 --> 00:33.547
which I thought was sort of fitting for a dying person to write.

00:34.428 --> 00:38.954
Well, I didn't die, and it's turned into a comic novel.

00:39.534 --> 00:41.296
So, but that's how I started it.

00:41.437 --> 00:43.659
Really, I'm sorry.

00:43.679 --> 00:44.740
I didn't know about your illness.

00:44.800 --> 00:45.601
Is this anything?

00:45.621 --> 00:46.122
Nobody does.

00:46.142 --> 00:46.462
It's okay.

00:46.482 --> 00:47.303
Don't worry about it.

00:47.884 --> 00:50.167
Well, can I use this in the piece?

00:50.327 --> 00:54.311
I don't think so, Nick, because it's not that I'm keeping it a secret.

00:55.273 --> 01:00.058
I am recovered, and although, you know, no one expected me to, and...

01:00.629 --> 01:06.358
It doesn't have anything to do with the book except that it was started under this kind of odd impulse.

01:06.378 --> 01:20.542
Okay, well, that is... But to pursue this, and I will certainly not discuss the illness, but why a comic novel under these profoundly disturbing circumstances?

01:20.722 --> 01:27.413
Well, I think that one of the things you find out when you get very sick is that...

01:28.591 --> 01:30.092
Life goes by opposite.

01:30.153 --> 01:33.936
You know, it's been revealing to me in many ways.

01:33.976 --> 01:36.118
And in fact, I'm writing a book about it.

01:37.500 --> 01:38.260
How about your illness?

01:38.300 --> 01:38.561
Yes.

01:39.341 --> 01:44.546
So I can say in the piece that you were, because you're writing about it, that you were seriously ill.

01:44.767 --> 01:44.847
Yes.

01:44.867 --> 01:46.208
We can certainly say that, right?

01:46.368 --> 01:47.409
You certainly may.

01:47.429 --> 01:48.190
Okay, go ahead.

01:50.832 --> 01:55.577
You know, we raise our children and we try to arrange things for them so that

01:56.165 --> 02:00.050
They have mainly pleasure and joy in their lives and not sorrow and pain.

02:00.851 --> 02:10.324
But in fact, when you are in pain and when you're frightened or in a state of dread or whatever, your pleasure is enhanced.

02:10.685 --> 02:15.351
Your sense of joy is much greater than it is under normal circumstances.

02:17.874 --> 02:25.024
You take pleasure in ordinary things, huge pleasure in ordinary things that you never felt when you were well.

02:26.405 --> 02:51.838
and i think you can see the comedy of life much more keenly when you're really gripped by feeling rather tragic about yourself so you expected this then to be your your final book yes i did if i lived to finish it you know i didn't even so you didn't even i mean

02:53.000 --> 02:54.822
How long did the book take you to write?

02:55.122 --> 02:59.687
Well, because I sort of passed out of the picture after that.

02:59.707 --> 03:02.570
I wrote a couple of chapters, and then they put me in a coma.

03:03.511 --> 03:07.675
And by the time I was able to work again, it was a year later.

03:08.876 --> 03:09.737
I'm sorry, how many years?

03:10.198 --> 03:13.401
Well, you see, I had to finish.

03:13.581 --> 03:16.564
I did come out of the coma, but I was very sick.

03:18.266 --> 03:19.888
I'm sorry I didn't know any of this.

03:19.908 --> 03:21.910
I had to revise Our Father.

03:22.430 --> 03:26.338
And then I revised a history I've been working on for years and years.

03:27.360 --> 03:31.328
And only then did I get around to George again.

03:32.831 --> 03:37.080
And so it was at least two years later.

03:39.035 --> 04:01.701
and well i'm just amazed i didn't you know do you know how you have an expectation that an interview will follow a certain certain path this was not the path you just kind of threw me off of this entire and it is it's fascinating i have to say uh did you expect how did you expect this to be read then do you think i don't expect it to be read um

04:03.453 --> 04:04.715
I guess the did and the do.

04:04.735 --> 04:06.157
With my life story in mind.

04:06.217 --> 04:08.982
I mean, I didn't put it in there, and I don't want it in there.

04:09.583 --> 04:27.150
But it is, after all, about the absurdity of our longing for this absolute love or love happily ever after or whatever that everyone seems to experience.

04:27.210 --> 04:31.637
I mean, I can't swear that all men do because most men refuse to admit it.

04:32.107 --> 04:34.270
But a couple of men have admitted it to me.

04:34.531 --> 04:35.072
Have admitted?

04:35.092 --> 04:37.115
That they feel this longing.

04:37.475 --> 04:38.577
Women all admit it.

04:38.677 --> 04:41.081
I mean, right across the board.

04:41.121 --> 04:47.451
And it is an absurd longing and an absurd need, and it drives us all our lives long.

04:48.252 --> 04:59.970
And it's kind of pathetic, but in a way, it's also... I very much like the ending of this novel because I'm suggesting it's what keeps us alive, and it's...

05:00.524 --> 05:02.366
It's part of the life force to strive.

05:03.007 --> 05:15.461
Well, speaking of the ending, without, you know, intending in any way to take away the pleasure of it, but I enjoy the comment on page 241 where you say, that's the great thing about being a writer.

05:15.501 --> 05:19.705
You can make everything up except your life.

05:19.725 --> 05:23.950
And now that you've given me this context, I think...

05:24.588 --> 05:48.688
i have a sense here you know which of what you're talking about there and then you also talk pardon me but at the very end but but there it is there it remains my spirit is still a girl's trapped inside a deteriorating container i think this is expressing precisely what you've just kind of uh told me about in a way i guess um

05:50.727 --> 05:55.933
Who, I guess, always try to get back on track here.

05:55.973 --> 05:57.955
You really derailed me here.

05:58.235 --> 06:00.277
That's a marvelous story.

06:01.879 --> 06:05.803
You saw this then as, I guess, the concluding work.

06:06.124 --> 06:16.735
So when I ask a young, emerging, first-time novelist, how do you expect to see your career develop?

06:16.715 --> 06:24.684
You were actually seeing this as the final word, so to speak, I guess, as what you've just told me.

06:25.184 --> 06:30.170
But now we're still talking then about your career and the arc of your career.

06:30.390 --> 06:38.679
And I guess maybe are you prepared at all to discuss your career as a fiction writer?

06:38.759 --> 06:42.283
And do you see it as a corpus and how this book fits into that corpus?

06:45.470 --> 06:53.922
Well, I do in a way, although I think probably it's not neat.

06:54.703 --> 06:56.325
I don't know that anybody says neat.

06:57.006 --> 07:02.914
The novels seem to have a shape of their own as far as my intentions go.

07:03.175 --> 07:14.110
The first one being about women's experience, women's relations with other women, women's work, which had never been written about seriously before.

07:14.950 --> 07:20.359
I mean, their work in the house, which hadn't been taken seriously in fiction.

07:20.419 --> 07:26.049
I don't know that it is even now, but I took it seriously in the women's room.

07:26.069 --> 07:35.305
And the next one was about love between a man and a woman, passionate, lustful love.

07:35.791 --> 07:40.758
and the possibilities of building on it, which I did not find very positive.

07:41.860 --> 07:58.203
And the third was about relations between mothers and daughters and the terrific complications of them and the hate as well as love that entered into that relationship.

07:59.305 --> 08:03.030
And our father, which I think nobody understood whatever,

08:03.803 --> 08:20.069
because there was a father in it who was pretty horrible, because I modeled the book on the Brothers Karamazov, which also has an absolutely, unbelievably vicious father, and at four sons, one illegitimate.

08:21.672 --> 08:31.347
But what I found so striking about the Brothers Karamazov, not when I read it, because I read it when I was 18, but years later, rereading it,

08:32.609 --> 08:38.696
was the relations among the sons as Dostoevsky depicts them because they're so sweet to each other.

08:38.716 --> 08:40.298
They're so loving to each other.

08:40.839 --> 08:42.521
I have never met brothers like that.

08:43.783 --> 08:48.648
Most brothers I know are filled with resentment and envy for their brothers.

08:49.389 --> 08:57.579
All kinds of very bad feelings dominate brotherly relations, it seems to me, as they often do sisterly relations.

08:58.661 --> 08:59.882
And I was surprised.

09:00.301 --> 09:03.905
because I adore that he had lied about this.

09:05.406 --> 09:13.534
And especially when all of the sons, except Smerdyakov, stand to inherit, and none of them was brought up together.

09:14.455 --> 09:15.516
They have different mothers.

09:15.556 --> 09:17.658
They have not known each other since childhood.

09:18.139 --> 09:25.366
You can say that that's an additional reason for them to be friendly to each other or like each other because they're strangers to each other.

09:25.806 --> 09:29.650
But it's also a very strong reason for them to dislike each other.

09:30.136 --> 09:32.019
Anyway, I thought a lot about that.

09:33.101 --> 09:48.284
And I was thinking about the state of feminism at the time and the way the difficulties of women of different classes and colors and ages making common cause.

09:48.564 --> 09:49.285
It's very hard.

09:49.305 --> 09:58.860
You think about a place like Mexico, say, or any other Latin country where many women have brilliant careers and...

09:59.718 --> 10:01.741
very lovely lives.

10:01.781 --> 10:04.204
They're married to important men.

10:04.264 --> 10:05.726
They have children.

10:06.266 --> 10:07.088
They have their career.

10:07.148 --> 10:12.014
And they can do this because servants are so cheap in these countries.

10:12.334 --> 10:16.800
They can get five women to work in their houses for practically nothing.

10:17.541 --> 10:26.292
And it's only because they keep these women, what we used to say, barefoot in the summer, pregnant in the winter and barefoot in the summer.

10:26.313 --> 10:29.016
The upper classes keep the poorer classes down

10:29.215 --> 10:31.739
that they're able to have the nice lives they have.

10:33.321 --> 10:41.913
So it's very hard for women of different classes to make common cause since their desires are really at odds with each other.

10:42.374 --> 10:46.600
And that's what I wrote that book about, women's relations with each other.

10:46.660 --> 10:50.405
But no one picked that up, no one, absolutely no one.

10:50.445 --> 10:58.817
But the title was kind of got you... Yes, because it all goes back to the patriarchal system, and our father is, in a sense, responsible.

10:59.438 --> 11:01.000
and the fact that they all worship.

11:01.560 --> 11:05.344
Of course, it also invokes the Lord's prayer, too, doesn't it?

11:06.245 --> 11:07.766
Anyway, so that book was that.

11:08.467 --> 11:10.209
And that I should end my life.

11:10.249 --> 11:16.955
Now, I'm leaving out the literary criticism, and I'm leaving out the philosophical books and the sociological books.

11:16.975 --> 11:19.698
Because those are quite apart from the fictive world.

11:19.738 --> 11:23.942
They're not really, but they're not part of the story in a way.

11:25.363 --> 11:26.965
To end with a kind of

11:27.755 --> 11:35.288
wry, testimonial to the power of sexual love seems to me right.

11:38.013 --> 11:38.654
I don't know.

11:38.775 --> 11:42.722
I visualize certain lines in print, and I can see that perfectly.

11:42.742 --> 11:44.745
It's a wonderful quote right there.

11:44.785 --> 11:45.747
Thank you.

11:46.165 --> 11:47.587
I'm sorry, did I interrupt?

11:47.607 --> 11:49.148
No, no.

11:49.489 --> 11:50.270
That was excellent.

11:51.732 --> 11:58.179
You said you don't see the nonfiction apart from the novels.

11:58.700 --> 12:03.986
No, I think the same concerns fill everything I've written.

12:04.306 --> 12:07.970
Nothing comes from any other place but the center of me.

12:08.912 --> 12:13.557
And the literary criticism is very much apart.

12:14.549 --> 12:21.524
My general philosophy and Beyond Power sort of encapsulates my philosophy.

12:21.705 --> 12:25.293
Although I suppose it's hard to speak of a book that long encapsulating anything.

12:27.337 --> 12:28.660
But it does contain...

12:29.618 --> 12:34.364
Now, I was going over some of the reviews of your books.

12:35.125 --> 12:39.230
That book was described by some of your reviewers as an angry book.

12:39.730 --> 12:40.111
Which one?

12:40.572 --> 12:41.092
Our Father.

12:41.753 --> 12:44.957
I mean, even in the press material that came up, sent out.

12:46.118 --> 12:48.401
Do you agree with that, or do you challenge that?

12:49.082 --> 12:53.267
No, it's full of rage, because the sisters hate each other.

12:53.287 --> 12:54.429
The author is not angry.

12:55.630 --> 12:57.212
The masters are.

12:57.428 --> 13:01.493
A lot of people get confused.

13:01.613 --> 13:15.770
But you see, and again, even in the New York Times review, which was, I would say, a positive review, and certainly the Times names it again this week as one of their editor's choices, so the editors certainly must agree with that as well.

13:17.092 --> 13:18.674
There's a sense of a mellowing here.

13:18.714 --> 13:22.238
So if there's a mellowing, I mean, this is a suggestion of the critic.

13:22.218 --> 13:24.121
then it's a mellowing from what?

13:24.141 --> 13:25.102
From an angry writer.

13:25.162 --> 13:27.666
So, I mean, do you disagree that you were an anger?

13:28.067 --> 13:32.954
Do you challenge the contention that you were, quote, unquote, an angry writer?

13:34.557 --> 13:34.617
No.

13:35.177 --> 13:36.299
You know it.

13:38.863 --> 13:46.194
You know, on Jonathan Swift's Tombstone, oh, I wish I could quote it for you, but it's Latin and I can't.

13:47.176 --> 13:50.841
It's Saevo, well,

13:51.327 --> 13:55.272
Realize one who lived in savage indignation.

13:56.854 --> 14:00.538
And that's very much the way I feel or certainly felt.

14:01.239 --> 14:04.222
I think I probably don't live in savage indignation anymore.

14:04.242 --> 14:08.347
Did he pick that for himself?

14:08.708 --> 14:09.489
I guess I believe he did.

14:09.509 --> 14:10.590
That's wonderful, isn't it?

14:10.610 --> 14:11.831
Yeah, it is.

14:11.852 --> 14:17.058
There's nothing wrong with being angry when you face a world full of injustice and cruelty.

14:17.779 --> 14:20.642
I don't know why people use the word angry as if it were

14:21.314 --> 14:27.243
as if it were a moral failure.

14:27.263 --> 14:34.995
Well, it's almost easy then for some of the people who don't like you to typecast you in a way, isn't it?

14:35.015 --> 14:36.498
Oh, she's an angry woman, you know?

14:37.619 --> 14:46.714
I'm sure that where you've been described in a Globe piece as the woman so many men love to hate.

14:46.794 --> 14:49.498
I mean, you've seen that phrase, I'm sure as well.

14:49.883 --> 14:51.646
That was in the Times, yeah.

14:51.666 --> 14:52.587
Was that in the Times?

14:52.647 --> 14:57.355
I've not particularly seen that before, but it's certainly true.

14:57.375 --> 14:57.956
It is true.

14:57.976 --> 14:58.416
Is that right?

14:58.436 --> 14:59.378
You would agree with it?

14:59.398 --> 15:00.640
Well, it certainly feels that way.

15:02.943 --> 15:05.547
I'm sorry, but we were talking about the nonfiction, I guess.

15:06.208 --> 15:10.455
The nonfiction is not angry because it's not a novel.

15:12.178 --> 15:15.543
You don't need anger in nonfiction.

15:15.563 --> 15:17.005
You need anger in fiction.

15:17.778 --> 15:20.824
when you don't put anger in nonfiction.

15:20.924 --> 15:29.560
No, you're an academic, you're an intellectual, you write seriously about important matters, you're a novelist.

15:30.021 --> 15:33.407
Do you have a feeling, a conviction that

15:34.079 --> 15:59.209
the novels that you write should be relevant i mean uh is that is that an essential aspect of the novel in your view and by extension therefore would you say obviously all of your novels are relevant in your view they were written with a purpose beyond storytelling i guess although i think this is a wonderful story this this novel here well i think all of them um

16:00.573 --> 16:04.398
I don't know that I ever wrote a novel with the idea that I had a message.

16:04.638 --> 16:05.660
No, I don't think so.

16:07.843 --> 16:27.269
But in both my novels and my literary criticism, and this caused me some difficulty as a literary critic, not with the books I published, but with shorter art pieces, because I'm not interested in writing about literature unless I am also writing about life.

16:28.711 --> 16:28.791
Hmm.

16:28.973 --> 16:35.800
this may seem, well, I don't know.

16:37.943 --> 16:54.520
The fact is it's not as easy to publish criticism that has some direct relation to human life than it is things that are written more or less in a vacuum that are simply literary studies.

16:54.540 --> 16:56.062
Say you're studying the imagery.

16:56.382 --> 16:58.845
I don't think they do this anymore, but when I was in school,

16:59.416 --> 17:27.347
there were lots of articles and even books studying the imagery of a particular poet in a particular work and it was they were often simply compilations of the kinds of imagery i have no interest in doing anything like that i wrote a piece on measure for measure i gave as a speech uh in which i show that the the women complaining at the ending of the play of sexual are really

17:27.800 --> 17:30.744
They're protesting to the Duke who has come back home to the city.

17:31.625 --> 17:36.971
And they're saying that Angelo did these terrible things to them while he was gone, the Duke.

17:36.991 --> 17:42.798
And what Angelo is really guilty of is sexual harassment to the nth degree.

17:43.459 --> 17:55.554
And what I found really fascinating, rereading Measure for Measure, because I was going to be speaking at Stratford, Ontario, and they were doing Measure for Measure that year.

17:55.934 --> 17:57.216
That's why I chose the play.

17:58.259 --> 18:13.596
To read these arguments again that the Duke and Angelo use against the women, and they are exactly the comments that the Senate Select Committee or whatever it was on Clarence Thomas used against Anita Hill.

18:14.657 --> 18:16.259
I found that staggering.

18:17.640 --> 18:18.040
That's amazing.

18:18.061 --> 18:19.042
I wrote a paper about it.

18:19.062 --> 18:21.925
I've never published it.

18:21.945 --> 18:22.225
Yeah.

18:22.728 --> 18:25.451
I don't write novels that way, though.

18:25.531 --> 18:32.338
I don't write novels with the idea that I'm going to point to something that's going on in the world and make a comment on it.

18:33.038 --> 18:50.035
I really try to write novels with the idea that I want to depict experience as I understand it honestly without distortions of a fantasy, of a

18:50.740 --> 19:08.479
that exist in so much women's literature even now the happily ever after ending is one of those you don't find that very often anymore but we've all been raised on it um you know i've asked any number of novelists over the years um

19:09.235 --> 19:25.033
And the consensus seems to be, although with a few notable exceptions, that each book certainly speaks for a period in their life and their development, that even if given the chance, they wouldn't go back and tinker with any books.

19:25.013 --> 19:30.141
Although I know Tim O'Brien is an exception.

19:30.201 --> 19:36.892
He's confided in me that he's gone in and changed going after Cacciato in significant ways.

19:37.172 --> 19:37.973
Really?

19:37.993 --> 19:44.203
And to the point that he got a letter from a professor who was reading from one edition and the students were reading in paperback in another.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.225
I was saying, what the hell is going on here?

19:46.245 --> 19:47.266
You know, this is not the same.

19:47.647 --> 19:48.968
We're not reading the same book.

19:48.988 --> 19:58.499
But I would have to believe that you feel that completed work is completed work, and it absolutely does speak for yourself, where you were at that point in your life.

19:58.639 --> 20:01.822
This is an expression of what you were doing at that point in your life.

20:02.143 --> 20:04.245
I guess that's just asking for a general comment.

20:04.766 --> 20:06.968
But, I mean, the women's room...

20:06.948 --> 20:08.150
Really, that was 1977.

20:08.470 --> 20:11.135
That was a 70s book, I would say, right?

20:11.475 --> 20:14.220
There's no way that you could write that in the 90s.

20:14.240 --> 20:15.261
And this is a 90s book.

20:15.281 --> 20:17.846
I don't think you could write this book in the 70s or the 80s.

20:17.946 --> 20:19.468
It's certainly set in the 90s, too.

20:20.330 --> 20:22.433
I guess I'm just looking for a general comment on that.

20:22.453 --> 20:24.356
I don't know where I'm going with that as a question.

20:25.418 --> 20:26.359
No, I think you're right.

20:26.560 --> 20:32.449
I don't know what it means either, except that things are rooted in

20:33.796 --> 20:39.508
That one is rooted in time and things are rooted in one and I don't know what else to say.

20:39.528 --> 20:50.050
Yeah, but I guess where you said earlier at the beginning that you thought that you would, for this book, for the reasons you've already given,

20:50.519 --> 20:53.525
It was time maybe for a lighter, a comic touch.

20:53.565 --> 20:56.070
And I guess now I understand why you picked a romance writer.

20:57.833 --> 20:59.596
Just a wonderful touch.

21:01.239 --> 21:07.992
Even her name has any number of different resonances, I would think as well.

21:08.233 --> 21:10.958
But do you see this as a love story?

21:12.777 --> 21:16.623
it is a love story.

21:16.643 --> 21:19.166
This is quite a departure for you, isn't it?

21:19.186 --> 21:21.790
I mean, in a way, isn't it?

21:21.810 --> 21:22.211
Do you think?

21:22.351 --> 21:24.614
Bleeding Heart was a love story.

21:24.634 --> 21:26.697
It also had a sadder ending.

21:27.739 --> 21:29.221
No, I don't think that's a departure.

21:29.241 --> 21:30.102
Okay.

21:30.122 --> 21:40.978
And I used the title of the... I gave the title of Bleeding Heart to that novel, although it's far from a romance, but to...

21:43.473 --> 21:46.376
to point up the romance elements.

21:49.740 --> 21:58.589
Just about all of my books make comments on other literature, although, again, no one has ever picked that up.

21:58.609 --> 22:12.484
The only person who did was Ann Barton, reviewing my Shakespeare book for the New York Review of Books, from which she did not review the Shakespeare book, but reviewed The Women's Room, because there's so much about Shakespeare in The Women's Room.

22:12.599 --> 22:23.329
And indeed there is, because I'm always using these things as counterpoint to whatever the story is I'm telling.

22:25.911 --> 22:30.356
So that Hermione, being a romance writer, you know how her books end.

22:32.057 --> 22:34.419
And her own ending is so very different.

22:35.500 --> 22:41.526
And in fact, the ending to all her romances has not been happy, even when it was happy for a time.

22:42.232 --> 22:44.895
she loses these guys or they die or something.

22:46.096 --> 22:50.621
Only in the New York Review of Books could you get away with a review like that.

22:50.641 --> 22:50.781
I know.

22:51.021 --> 22:52.122
It was really cruel.

22:52.823 --> 22:54.965
I should probably have written a letter, but I didn't.

22:55.766 --> 22:57.668
I mean, they talk about relevance.

22:57.708 --> 23:01.953
I mean, you finally asked, well, did you like the book or not?

23:02.113 --> 23:05.236
You know, I mean, what about the book that you're supposed to be reviewing?

23:05.296 --> 23:08.199
I mean, does that seem to... Well, she never reviewed it.

23:08.219 --> 23:11.783
She was so outraged by the comments I had made in the women's room.

23:12.404 --> 23:17.730
But she finally, this was the opportunity to weigh in with it.

23:17.830 --> 23:22.275
I say things like Lear, you know, which I have to play, I revere.

23:22.395 --> 23:26.720
I think it's the greatest thing ever, maybe one of the greatest pieces of literature ever written.

23:27.581 --> 23:30.904
You know, he doesn't end up on the heat or whatever.

23:31.004 --> 23:37.011
He ends up an old man drooling over his oatmeal in, you know, a cottage in Scarfdale or something.

23:38.780 --> 23:41.625
She didn't like any of it.

23:41.645 --> 23:42.166
It's funny.

23:42.868 --> 23:44.431
I wrote something.

23:45.192 --> 23:46.194
I did a number.

23:46.214 --> 23:48.498
I remember the Shakespeare book, in fact.

23:48.719 --> 23:49.320
I have it here.

23:51.905 --> 23:53.988
That's got to be quite a few years ago.

23:54.029 --> 23:57.535
That's at least 15 years ago, I would think, the Shakespeare book.

23:58.337 --> 23:59.218
Yeah, I would say.

23:59.238 --> 24:00.180
It seems to me.

24:00.835 --> 24:04.922
I don't have to take up too much of your time, by the way, but I do have a couple of questions.

24:04.942 --> 24:08.428
Where do you weigh in on this debate on the literary canon?

24:08.488 --> 24:09.770
I mean, just to switch gears.

24:10.732 --> 24:22.472
I'm writing a book now myself, where I hope to pay some attention to this, and without taking sides at all, believe me, but just to kind of enter this debate in.

24:22.452 --> 24:24.276
It's fascinating me.

24:25.078 --> 24:41.794
This whole debate on the literary canon relevance of books that should be in the... There's a book on the front page of the New York Times this Sunday about the fellow who goes back to school, Denby's book, and he takes the literature...

24:41.993 --> 24:43.856
courses that he took 30 years ago.

24:44.477 --> 24:49.405
Do you have any opinions on this debate or any observations that you care to share with me?

24:49.545 --> 24:59.300
Well, of course, I don't teach anymore and I haven't for some years, but I think that the debate is largely a lot of hot air in a balloon.

25:00.983 --> 25:09.216
The fact is that most courses are still heavily weighed down by the old classics.

25:10.445 --> 25:20.255
I don't really see them being endangered anymore than they have been endangered over the past couple of hundred years because students can't read them.

25:21.196 --> 25:30.205
Now, if anything is endangering the literary canon of the past, it's the illiteracy of new generation of students.

25:30.225 --> 25:34.869
When I was teaching in my early years, not at Harvard, of course.

25:35.650 --> 25:39.574
At Harvard, you got a different class of students, but when I taught elsewhere,

25:39.807 --> 25:42.630
Students couldn't read Milton.

25:42.650 --> 25:46.213
To read Chaucer, you have to almost learn a new language.

25:47.534 --> 25:59.445
Now, I happen to love Chaucer and Milton, but teaching Shakespeare, it's very difficult to get students to understand it because it's a different language.

26:00.045 --> 26:01.006
And of course, it's early.

26:02.187 --> 26:09.814
And Milton, who will write maybe 12 or 15 lines of verse before the main verb of the main clause appears,

26:10.351 --> 26:11.533
really throws them.

26:12.213 --> 26:17.801
And in fact, that's how I taught it when I taught it, was look for the subject of the sentence and then look for the verb.

26:18.682 --> 26:20.764
And then they could maybe make a little headway.

26:21.566 --> 26:25.651
And this is what's endangering the traditional canon.

26:26.672 --> 26:36.645
Which is, which is, should be encouraged to read books by someone like Genoa Abebe or, I mean, of course they should.

26:37.013 --> 26:38.715
These are wonderful things.

26:38.835 --> 26:47.685
It's not as though, because they're written by black people or women, they're not as good as what Trollope wrote or what Dickens wrote.

26:47.725 --> 26:49.607
That is a ridiculous idea.

26:51.950 --> 27:01.621
How do you feel when you hear, for instance, now that you can get a degree in English literature from Georgetown without being required to study Shakespeare?

27:01.881 --> 27:04.724
Well, I think it's a loss.

27:05.926 --> 27:06.987
But as I say,

27:08.249 --> 27:14.435
The loss lies elsewhere than in the faculty's selection of material.

27:15.797 --> 27:19.580
It is a loss in literacy, and it is general.

27:19.600 --> 27:22.023
It is across the board, and it is a result of TV.

27:23.284 --> 27:25.686
And I don't think there's anything you can do to change it.

27:26.727 --> 27:29.490
I don't think that people will be able to read Milton.

27:30.151 --> 27:34.375
It'll be like when we went to school, when I went to school, Beowulf,

27:35.165 --> 27:40.914
You know, you really had to take a course in Old English before you could study Beowulf.

27:40.934 --> 27:45.000
And I imagine that Chaucer is practically in that condition now.

27:45.260 --> 27:48.245
But, I mean, I remember reading, I was an English major back in the 60s.

27:48.325 --> 27:51.630
I mean, I remember reading Beowulf and reading Chaucer.

27:51.790 --> 27:54.194
But you had to take a course in Old English to read Beowulf.

27:54.254 --> 27:55.116
Well, there you go.

27:55.156 --> 27:56.918
But, I mean, so what's wrong with that?

27:57.059 --> 27:57.559
Nothing is wrong.

27:57.599 --> 27:58.761
If you're going to be an English major.

27:58.781 --> 28:00.884
Nothing is wrong with it except kids don't want to do it.

28:01.465 --> 28:02.627
And they won't do it, I guess.

28:02.647 --> 28:03.248
That's right.

28:03.886 --> 28:06.409
And they don't take them, and they don't understand.

28:06.549 --> 28:14.198
And what is the point of forcing them to read something they don't understand and they don't have patience for when they could be reading something they do understand?

28:14.258 --> 28:15.860
At least that way they're reading.

28:16.781 --> 28:20.345
Look, I am a traditionalist in many ways.

28:20.526 --> 28:22.688
I revere the literature of the past.

28:23.589 --> 28:31.178
But I think that maybe it's better for us to read Chinoa Bebe than to read the Iliad.

28:31.218 --> 28:32.880
The Iliad is...

28:33.164 --> 28:36.990
A horrible story, really.

28:37.731 --> 28:40.275
We don't read it in Greek to begin with.

28:41.677 --> 28:44.341
All right, so we understand literary references.

28:44.441 --> 28:51.151
We understand the meaning of the word Achilles, the full meaning of that word, or the full meaning of the word Hector.

28:51.872 --> 29:02.428
We understand a story that's referred to in other literature, but not the literature of today for the most part, because the people who are writing the literature of today

29:02.577 --> 29:08.102
For the most part, never read the Iliad or wouldn't think of referring to it.

29:08.963 --> 29:09.443
I don't know.

29:09.563 --> 29:12.726
I wish we could all read everything.

29:12.786 --> 29:13.887
That would be my wish.

29:15.429 --> 29:25.238
But I want to be reading what's new and what's being written now by people who are looking at the world with fresh eyes.

29:25.518 --> 29:30.222
I also want and always wanted to know the work of the past.

29:30.978 --> 29:36.104
but there's a limit to how much you can teach in four years in an English course, let's say.

29:37.125 --> 29:50.121
When, for instance, new proofs come along in mathematics, what happens is the whole system gears up a notch so that the earlier people are given less time.

29:50.141 --> 29:58.892
And there's no argument about tradition then, because the old things have been superseded by new ideas.

29:59.598 --> 30:04.262
You learn the old ideas, but, you know, you don't spend the whole term on them as you might once have.

30:05.143 --> 30:07.665
You might have in the 14th or 15th century.

30:09.987 --> 30:11.308
This is literature.

30:11.549 --> 30:13.570
You have to let some of the old go.

30:13.590 --> 30:23.960
And anyway, as I said, really, the argument is a non-argument because what the real fact is is that kids can't read.

30:25.401 --> 30:26.342
They can't read literature.

30:26.402 --> 30:27.163
They can read words.

30:27.263 --> 30:28.744
They can read newspapers, maybe.

30:29.450 --> 30:30.891
That's really frightening, isn't it?

30:31.412 --> 30:32.133
Yes.

30:32.153 --> 30:34.095
And do you subscribe to this?

30:34.155 --> 30:36.397
There's a brand new book I just got from Norton.

30:36.417 --> 30:41.202
I haven't had a chance to read it all, but I've been certainly impressed by the essays I've read called Dumbing Down.

30:41.222 --> 30:46.427
You know, that's a phrase we've encountered in the last couple of years.

30:46.487 --> 30:54.275
Do you see a pervasive sense of a dumbing down everywhere across the board?

30:54.295 --> 30:57.718
I have a brand new word for a major TV station.

30:58.407 --> 31:22.980
as the newscaster and talked about orders coming through the newsroom dumb down the news and we all know it has been compared the evening news now to the evening news 30 years you may not be old enough trust me i am i'm in my mid 50s well then you know and i've been a student of the news i'm a really a careful student of it uh

31:23.770 --> 31:24.535
quite some time.

31:24.595 --> 31:28.701
But the news, but also in the works that come.
