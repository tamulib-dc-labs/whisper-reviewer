WEBVTT

00:03.085 --> 00:04.747
We're talking to Carol Moore.

00:04.767 --> 00:06.450
Do you use a middle initial?

00:07.591 --> 00:07.932
Not really.

00:08.092 --> 00:08.452
Okay.

00:08.533 --> 00:10.335
And your formal title is?

00:10.355 --> 00:11.417
Chief Librarian.

00:11.497 --> 00:11.837
Okay.

00:11.917 --> 00:14.701
And this is for the whole university system?

00:14.721 --> 00:14.982
Yes.

00:15.002 --> 00:27.859
So you have perhaps 50 or 60 libraries under your... Well, it's a complex administrative structure, and the main university libraries are in what's called the central system.

00:27.879 --> 00:31.945
And that includes the Pittsburgh Library, the Fisher Library, the Lyons Library.

00:32.802 --> 00:35.244
the education library.

00:35.264 --> 00:41.970
There are a number of divisional libraries that report to divisions, and I have more coordinated responsibility.

00:41.990 --> 00:46.455
But that's under review constantly, actually.

00:46.475 --> 00:58.566
One thing that's very interesting is I understand that, and you don't, I don't see this certainly in the United States, but I'm sure there are a few examples, but you do have a protected budget, isn't that right, for book?

00:58.586 --> 00:59.667
For acquisitions, yes.

00:59.687 --> 00:59.887
Correct.

00:59.947 --> 01:02.269
I mean, that's unusual.

01:03.565 --> 01:17.163
Yes, although I think a number of people do inquire, and the issue is the protection for inflation and against budget cuts for public institutions.

01:17.344 --> 01:20.227
The fate of the government funding affects us a lot.

01:21.549 --> 01:33.285
So there was a, it really has been from the late 50s and when there was a review of the whole library system, all of the interesting libraries.

01:33.822 --> 01:39.427
The evaluation was we didn't have a strong library and we really needed to build it.

01:39.447 --> 01:40.428
And at that point.

01:40.488 --> 01:41.209
And this was about when?

01:41.890 --> 01:43.571
In the late 50s.

01:43.591 --> 01:43.711
Okay.

01:43.972 --> 01:45.233
So the decision was made.

01:45.653 --> 01:50.318
To build the library, you know, be a great research library.

01:52.279 --> 01:57.885
What do you think the basic numbers were at that time, just as if you could possibly do?

01:58.665 --> 01:59.646
I wish I could.

01:59.666 --> 01:59.766
Okay.

01:59.846 --> 02:03.610
I wish I could say, but it was, it wasn't a strong research library.

02:04.400 --> 02:27.400
The president at that point, Claude Bishop, which was then by the 60s, was a professor of English and was really interested in having a great library.

02:27.540 --> 02:33.225
We started at that point also to add to the faculty

02:34.049 --> 02:41.298
And we traditionally had quite a good, strong humanities practice as well as other disciplines.

02:41.639 --> 02:48.167
And all the disciplines grew greatly in the 60s in the library as well.

02:48.848 --> 02:53.774
And this library was planned at that moment too.

02:54.375 --> 02:57.659
About 1968, there was an end to the capital funding.

02:57.679 --> 03:02.605
And this was one of the last large buildings that we built for about 20 years.

03:03.175 --> 03:13.551
We were very fortunate, really, in getting this amount of space, and it really has made it possible to store the material.

03:14.472 --> 03:19.760
And generally, how many titles did you say are stored in here on this building?

03:20.441 --> 03:26.029
At the moment, it's probably about approaching format.

03:27.151 --> 03:29.775
That's more than Widener.

03:29.795 --> 03:31.157
It was built to accommodate

03:31.610 --> 03:34.655
as easily as 4.5 million.

03:34.895 --> 03:37.900
So we're beginning to approach the limits here.

03:37.920 --> 03:38.781
So what do you do at that point?

03:39.042 --> 03:41.125
Well, that's a good question.

03:41.145 --> 03:48.396
The plan was 25 years, and so we have... That doesn't happen in fact?

03:48.617 --> 03:51.060
No, the plan, I think it's phenomenal, actually.

03:51.201 --> 03:59.153
When you look back at what they planned, there have been a lot of changes, and a lot of their assumptions were not quite right, but the overall result was right.

04:00.263 --> 04:13.042
The compact storage in the two sub-basin are really only starting to be really well used.

04:13.062 --> 04:14.204
So I think, yeah.

04:14.264 --> 04:16.548
Well, we really haven't even used them all.

04:16.568 --> 04:19.853
So that's, I think, where we're going now.

04:19.893 --> 04:22.056
You opened about, what, 73 or so, is that right?

04:22.116 --> 04:23.218
Yes, we opened in 73.

04:23.238 --> 04:25.762
So your 25 years are up next.

04:25.782 --> 04:28.266
Basically, it's worked precisely as planned.

04:28.286 --> 04:28.566
That's right.

04:28.765 --> 04:31.728
So what do you do in 1999?

04:31.748 --> 04:36.333
Well, what we're doing right now is using all of the bases and trying to use the contact storage.

04:36.894 --> 04:46.905
We're also adding to the other satellite, not the other facilities, the science library, which I was just looking at plans.

04:46.945 --> 04:48.607
We're trying to extend that.

04:48.867 --> 04:56.916
We looked at off-site storage, but about 10 years ago when I took on the position,

04:58.162 --> 05:08.037
that the university strongly encouraged us to look at on-site services, a more usable context, because of the cost.

05:08.057 --> 05:16.169
And I know this is really not the way most people are thinking, but I think it's actually preferable from the user's point of view.

05:16.189 --> 05:27.426
Well, from the user's point of view, you don't have to go someplace far distant, and we don't have to try to retrieve the things and essentially operate another

05:27.575 --> 05:38.607
And actually a whole staff and logistical apparatus to get the stuff back and forth, as they do at Harvard, which I've been to see that deposit for.

05:38.627 --> 05:40.188
I have to live about 10 miles from it.

05:41.490 --> 05:42.571
And it is something.

05:42.751 --> 05:44.633
It's stuff that nobody is using.

05:45.954 --> 05:52.401
But it does represent an attitude there, and it's actually quality that there's no such thing as a deck book.

05:53.056 --> 05:58.961
I think in our informal discussions last night, you did indicate that books absolutely are alive here at the Union.

05:59.101 --> 06:03.646
Maybe you could just tell me a little bit about that attitude.

06:03.666 --> 06:06.708
I mean, I don't see, you're not deaccessioning things, you know?

06:07.029 --> 06:14.856
No, with the exception of some duplicates, you know, we've got a lot of materials for reading lists.

06:14.876 --> 06:16.597
And after that, they go off.

06:17.678 --> 06:21.662
After we go off the reading lists, they're really not used very much, so we only keep

06:21.878 --> 06:29.385
And the other unusual part of our system is we have the federated college system.

06:29.405 --> 06:31.667
So we have a number of colleges, libraries.

06:31.687 --> 06:39.495
So we actually have quite a lot more duplication on those classes in the college libraries.

06:39.515 --> 06:40.596
Victoria College, St.

06:40.616 --> 06:42.738
Michael College, Trinity College.

06:43.178 --> 06:44.760
But they're part of the university?

06:44.780 --> 06:46.902
They're part of the university system.

06:46.922 --> 06:50.265
This is more like the greater system than that.

06:50.498 --> 07:02.330
Is there any kind of, I know that the educational system is a provincial matter and not a federal matter, but is there any kind of a national policy for book acquisition?

07:02.511 --> 07:02.751
No.

07:03.592 --> 07:07.396
So you're all basically doing your own thing.

07:07.416 --> 07:10.439
How representative is this sort of?

07:10.739 --> 07:20.269
We discussed this federally, and in fact, with the origins of this library, a lot of it, there was federal funding for research collection.

07:21.025 --> 07:27.173
That has shrunk over the years, and the passage of the responsibility to almost completely prevent you.

07:27.614 --> 07:31.659
There's less and less, which I think is a real problem for us.

07:31.679 --> 07:33.382
As compared to the U.S.

07:33.402 --> 07:43.235
or the nuclear libraries or Germany, Australia, all of them have policies that help strengthen death in ways that we may not really do.

07:43.255 --> 07:44.477
It's a serious problem.

07:44.517 --> 07:50.745
How do you feel, I mean, any modern university is going to have to be

07:50.978 --> 07:56.826
to the electronic revolution that's upon us.

07:56.846 --> 08:05.939
Do you have a dichotomy that separates the electronic stuff from your own mind philosophically, even from the printed books?

08:05.959 --> 08:09.084
Who do the printed books figure into this stuff?

08:09.104 --> 08:13.430
Well, this is back to the front end of answering your question about attitude.

08:13.450 --> 08:19.298
My own background is in what I started in reference in public service, although I worked all over the library.

08:21.472 --> 08:28.942
It seems to me that it's quite possible that the future could be simply more of everything.

08:28.962 --> 08:33.249
That has been our experience, at least in this type of library.

08:34.390 --> 08:48.610
Our experience so far is that whatever we've done electronically, we've tried to stay at the leading edge electronically because it provides a lot of access that we were able to provide if you just look at providing print materials in one location.

08:48.961 --> 08:51.964
or the cardcaverone, you have to come into it.

08:51.984 --> 08:54.847
So it really does extend access in lots of ways.

08:55.828 --> 09:02.494
On the other hand, whatever we've done has increased the book and print news quite a lot.

09:02.515 --> 09:06.098
And the more we do electronically, the more people use the print.

09:07.219 --> 09:18.090
And at present, I think the better job we do in making things accessible, the more support we have on campus for this protective system.

09:18.712 --> 09:23.739
the more accepted acquisition systems.

09:23.759 --> 09:25.401
But we're talking about books when you say that.

09:25.421 --> 09:25.902
Yeah, the books.

09:26.423 --> 09:32.090
But they also want, the scientists also want the databases, and so do the humanities policy.

09:32.110 --> 09:32.791
Which are essential.

09:33.072 --> 09:34.494
They need it all.

09:34.514 --> 09:43.386
When I was out at Stanford doing research for this book, they said, look, you do a scientific monograph.

09:43.720 --> 09:45.944
It costs a fortune to buy.

09:46.244 --> 09:54.499
You might sell a thousand copies for an extraordinary amount of money, and by the time it's printed, it may be obsolete or whatever.

09:55.120 --> 10:01.611
Something like this really probably does belong as an electronic publication.

10:01.878 --> 10:04.020
Oh, I think you're right.

10:04.040 --> 10:05.802
There's not going to be any changes.

10:05.822 --> 10:07.544
I just think that that makes sense.

10:07.924 --> 10:16.393
I mean, you can access it, and you'll find some way if you want to download it and print it, because the office certainly has to get paid in one way or another.

10:16.413 --> 10:28.425
It would seem to me that if you're going to write something, and somebody's not going to buy a physical book, but they're going to just pull it off of some sort of warranty system, because you won't have people writing books.

10:29.097 --> 10:37.126
or the OED or encyclopedias, you know, reference things that really make sense, I think, electronically.

10:37.146 --> 10:49.579
But, you know, when you talk about novels and poetry and creative things, I mean, the book, people who say the book is dying, I mean, they're really burying it, I think, a little too soon.

10:49.599 --> 10:53.003
That's just my own sense of the situation.

10:53.023 --> 10:55.265
But, I don't know.

10:55.405 --> 10:55.746
I agree.

10:56.226 --> 10:57.788
I think, I can envision

10:58.443 --> 11:08.614
In fact, if you look at some young people's behavior, it looks like they don't read books at all because it's possible that you read a future without a lot of books.

11:08.634 --> 11:20.087
On the other hand, there's a revival of interest in some types of books and a huge market for some types of books.

11:20.107 --> 11:27.775
So that's why I say it's quite possible that maybe the scientists or the humanities people,

11:27.974 --> 11:34.403
can get whatever they need online on the deadlock more conveniently, I think that that has a terrific attraction.

11:34.463 --> 11:41.954
We're trying to deliver as much that way as we can because we can't have 70,000 users here.

11:42.074 --> 11:51.548
We can't have everybody trying to share one copy of a journal very effectively, but we have them on the sites of the photographs.

11:51.648 --> 11:54.893
And that's not an efficient tool, so it makes much more sense to have it on there.

11:55.278 --> 12:07.630
things that are heavily used on some sort of online, and even perhaps things that are not used very often called up on an online.

12:07.650 --> 12:22.804
On the other hand, once people get interested in it, I think it's just like collecting, once people discover that there is more, they get led into that, the more into the past, into the thoughts that people had

12:23.712 --> 12:25.614
you know, in other times or other places.

12:26.314 --> 12:43.570
And the question of browsing both the online system and then being taken into other formats, I think it's just more a question of inaccessibility that why people don't need to be involved upon than the fact that they don't want to.

12:43.610 --> 12:48.554
There are so many people in the world that are interested in almost every arcane subject.

12:48.574 --> 12:51.897
It's just that they don't have the opportunity to all get together or come

12:52.113 --> 12:53.835
come to one particular library.

12:53.855 --> 12:55.196
How do you respond?

12:55.897 --> 13:03.304
You know, you have to respond to a specific instance, but I'll give you one, you know, when you hear that it's been reported in the Chronicle of Higher Education elsewhere.

13:04.185 --> 13:09.530
When a brand new college is starting up in Monterey, California, everybody knows this story.

13:09.550 --> 13:12.673
And there isn't even a library in the plans.

13:15.056 --> 13:19.600
Of course, it was intended to be, I guess, a scientific or technical school.

13:20.081 --> 13:21.242
How do you respond?

13:21.526 --> 13:25.371
to that when you hear something like that.

13:26.813 --> 13:35.043
Well, I think you often do hear sort of forward thinking administrators talking like this.

13:35.063 --> 13:43.413
And sometimes they believe it, but really they don't need any kind of library information.

13:43.433 --> 13:45.155
And I think that's not it.

13:45.175 --> 13:46.097
They just seem informed.

13:46.117 --> 13:51.023
In other cases, I think they're just overstating the case.

13:51.043 --> 13:51.263
Yeah.

13:51.901 --> 13:56.606
They don't need to place a lot of emphasis in it.

13:56.626 --> 14:07.958
You aren't under any kind of, I shouldn't use the word pressure, but pressure from trustees, or I don't know if you have trustees or by the administration, to say, look, you've got 10 million books.

14:07.978 --> 14:08.759
That's a lot of books.

14:09.680 --> 14:13.023
At some point, there's a ceiling.

14:13.424 --> 14:16.888
Is there anything like that in there?

14:17.288 --> 14:21.132
Is there any limit to the minimum book?

14:23.018 --> 14:25.720
Because books are expensive.

14:25.821 --> 14:31.085
And to maintain and to take care of them and to house them and to shell them, that costs money.

14:31.105 --> 14:35.049
And people who are looking at expenses have to take this stuff into account.

14:35.369 --> 14:42.055
And especially when they see a book like the one I mentioned last night that hasn't been read in 85 years, you have to justify keeping that book, don't you?

14:43.036 --> 14:45.378
I'm talking on a very general basis.

14:45.458 --> 14:48.501
Some people do think that way.

14:48.521 --> 14:50.983
I think it doesn't take

14:51.537 --> 14:54.922
too long to explain that we are the largest library in Canada.

14:55.162 --> 15:01.310
And certainly as a country, we want at least one great research library.

15:01.330 --> 15:05.456
And so this is already it, and so we shouldn't be building it.

15:06.978 --> 15:12.466
So I, in the long run, I think I have not had a lot of trouble making that case for us.

15:12.786 --> 15:20.076
Some of the smaller libraries definitely have that problem, because they say, well, why duplicate it?

15:20.613 --> 15:27.201
You can't possibly invest as much, so why not just share resources with another library?

15:28.102 --> 15:30.765
And so I think that's the issue with the U.S.

15:30.785 --> 15:33.208
How many of these collections can you build?

15:33.228 --> 15:34.330
Everybody can't be a harlot.

15:35.151 --> 15:37.454
So shouldn't we do something else?

15:37.694 --> 15:46.825
So maybe there are a few who are emerging from the pack and who are either assuming for themselves the responsibility for being the major repository.

15:46.985 --> 15:48.527
And I heard this in Harvard.

15:49.148 --> 15:52.753
the University of California system together with me and the UCLA.

15:52.773 --> 15:57.860
You know, they've got about 15 million books, and they go off-site and store.

15:57.920 --> 16:05.070
You know, you find these, there are these areas emerging, and there might be half a dozen of them at some point.

16:05.110 --> 16:07.112
Library of Commerce, of course.

16:07.133 --> 16:08.875
I mean, it's a big one.

16:08.895 --> 16:12.260
But you don't have a comparable Library of Commerce up there, do you?

16:12.280 --> 16:14.162
No, the National Library got quite a late start.

16:14.182 --> 16:16.365
But that's strictly Canadiana, I guess, right?

16:16.385 --> 16:17.046
Yes, it was in Indiana, so.

16:17.498 --> 16:17.819
Right.

16:18.059 --> 16:22.527
And obviously, academic researchers need other fields.

16:22.547 --> 16:28.959
When you talk about a research library, I mean, just explain in language terms what that means.

16:28.979 --> 16:40.080
Well, it's a question which you can really study in depth and breadth of a variety of different fields.

16:40.938 --> 16:51.914
I think it also includes primary databases and electronic files.

16:52.014 --> 16:58.083
I think that is one of the great issues.

16:58.484 --> 17:09.460
More and more things are really never reaching information, reaching prints.

17:09.727 --> 17:20.263
The amount of that is worth keeping, storing, and I think we haven't really decided how to handle that problem very well.

17:20.704 --> 17:36.007
You mentioned going back to the 50s when you gave me the name of the president, but the decision was made, listen, we are going to become a great institution.

17:36.848 --> 17:38.991
When you think of greatness as one of the

17:39.055 --> 17:43.782
criteria of libraries.

17:44.964 --> 17:47.548
To achieve greatness, do you have to have a major library?

17:47.648 --> 17:49.571
At a university, yes.

17:49.591 --> 17:50.112
At any university.

17:50.212 --> 17:51.113
You would measure that.

17:51.153 --> 17:57.162
I mean, what are the best colleges and universities in North America?

17:57.623 --> 18:00.407
One of the things that you would look at, I guess, is the library.

18:00.667 --> 18:02.029
Does that make sense?

18:02.049 --> 18:03.091
You have to have the numbers.

18:03.111 --> 18:05.755
In terms of the size of the collection?

18:06.410 --> 18:07.191
Numbers?

18:07.391 --> 18:07.732
Both.

18:07.812 --> 18:10.696
Numbers and also the quality of the materials.

18:10.916 --> 18:12.358
Yes.

18:12.378 --> 18:14.861
Now, that is a .

18:14.881 --> 18:18.726
I guess if you want to be recognized as great, you have to have a great library.

18:18.826 --> 18:19.507
Is that what I mean?

18:19.527 --> 18:22.871
I mean, if you're going to assume that you would be dismissed.

18:24.894 --> 18:25.955
I think so.

18:26.035 --> 18:27.797
If you had a mediocre collection.

18:27.817 --> 18:28.318
I certainly think so.

18:28.338 --> 18:36.028
Many people argue that you don't, the so-called printage or collection numbers isn't what matters, it's the access.

18:36.633 --> 18:40.318
That may be true, but I think you have to have guaranteed access.

18:43.442 --> 18:46.265
It's not enough to have it.

18:46.285 --> 18:47.167
It's not enough to have it.

18:47.187 --> 18:47.787
You have to have access.

18:47.807 --> 18:48.669
You have to make it available.

18:48.689 --> 18:49.730
You have to make it available.

18:49.790 --> 18:58.922
But that means if you're an institution who has decided not to buy it, then you have to guarantee the access in some way.

18:58.942 --> 19:02.226
You can't just assume someone's going to do it for you.

19:02.246 --> 19:03.788
And that, I think, is both for...

19:04.595 --> 19:11.964
You can't just assume that the Library of Congress is going to supply knowledge for everyone.

19:13.086 --> 19:27.444
And that's the kind of assumption when I think sometimes people building new institutions say, oh, well, we'll get this from somewhere, without thinking about what they're saying.

19:27.464 --> 19:34.112
If you really are sure that someone's going to provide it for you, then I think you can definitely rely on that.

19:34.244 --> 19:35.906
You've got to put those things in place.

19:36.767 --> 19:42.533
It's not the big pile of books that suddenly are going to do the job for it.

19:42.553 --> 19:43.874
So you do have a different perspective.

19:43.914 --> 19:48.899
You have all of these libraries, Richard being rare books, of course.

19:48.919 --> 19:49.901
Yes, right.

19:50.261 --> 19:56.968
I haven't discussed this at all with anybody who's curious.

19:56.988 --> 20:00.792
You know, obviously when you need money to acquire things like that,

20:01.278 --> 20:05.224
sure that a good part of his job is to go and raise money.

20:05.244 --> 20:11.913
You really rely on the kindness of your friends, I guess, in your books.

20:12.594 --> 20:21.767
But do you have a mandate for supporting special collection acquisitions?

20:21.787 --> 20:22.147
In the university?

20:22.167 --> 20:22.888
Yeah.

20:22.908 --> 20:23.389
Oh, yes.

20:24.170 --> 20:29.918
I think those unique or rare materials are really what

20:30.775 --> 20:39.044
a lot of the researchers use and what distinguishes us from the other libraries.

20:39.064 --> 20:40.626
And what attracts major scholars.

20:40.886 --> 20:58.605
Well, and as we continue building, and this is the question about access, as much as people say that maybe you don't need, many people, everything, you can get most things online, or you're going to be able to get most things online,

21:00.661 --> 21:10.609
hearing scholars either come here, they want to go to Harvard, they want to go to other great libraries in the world.

21:10.649 --> 21:13.112
They do go because they have lots of materials.

21:13.132 --> 21:16.274
I don't believe they go for any other reason.

21:16.294 --> 21:17.495
It's not just reputation.

21:17.535 --> 21:20.498
They go to using materials, and it's large numbers.

21:20.518 --> 21:30.246
So I think this idea that we need to swing more to access is true, but it's been overstated, I think, in our profession.

21:30.732 --> 21:33.695
Or at least be nowhere out of here to get a hold of it.

21:33.715 --> 21:50.892
I did an interview with Stephen Jay Gould for, and this will be another chapter just talking to writers, and he says, he can't work, and of course it's all the spiritual stuff, but he said, there's something about handling the original document.

21:50.912 --> 21:50.992
Yes.

21:51.012 --> 21:51.332
Oh, wow.

21:51.592 --> 21:57.798
And, you know, and he said, a facsimile just won't do for me, or a book.

21:57.838 --> 22:00.621
He really wants to handle the original book and all that.

22:01.563 --> 22:28.617
and i i wonder how many scholars feel that way that you have to have they really have to have access to that primary stuff so i don't know i'm just thinking out loud on that but well i think there's always a difference between the original the original whatever format it is and the and the practice so that is why we're to be um honest that we were partly um we're just getting started in the preservation area

22:29.272 --> 22:36.481
We hired a preservation librarian, and we listened to what was going on in the U.S.

22:36.661 --> 22:45.713
about, at that point it was microphones mainly, materials that were in terrible condition, and they were discarding them.

22:46.894 --> 22:57.287
And we started doing that as well, and we, on the grounds that these things were unusable, we received a lot of criticism that these things really weren't unusable.

22:57.708 --> 22:58.789
And if you just looked at them,

22:59.140 --> 23:00.822
They weren't unusable.

23:00.842 --> 23:02.063
They were the artists.

23:02.483 --> 23:11.872
They may become unusable in another 40 years, but in fact, we changed our thinking on that and put everything back on the shelves.

23:11.952 --> 23:14.174
We don't just find anything.

23:14.194 --> 23:14.715
That's right.

23:14.735 --> 23:19.399
At the University of Michigan, they actually have committees, and they look at that.

23:20.000 --> 23:24.244
Can we afford to keep this book in five years, let's say.

23:24.284 --> 23:26.886
Five years, I guess, is the number that they've thrown out.

23:27.727 --> 23:32.833
used an item in five years, maybe we should take a look at it.

23:33.034 --> 23:40.263
And it's something that maybe is better served online or accessionate.

23:40.743 --> 23:43.867
And, you know, they really are having to study.

23:45.149 --> 23:46.871
I'm fairly concerned about that.

23:47.391 --> 23:54.240
I mean, you buy a book with the... I would say you have to feel the responsibility that you're not just buying books for a

23:54.760 --> 24:01.326
You know, the kids who are here now, you really are buying from me 85 years down the line.

24:01.646 --> 24:03.988
When I need this book, thank goodness it's there.

24:04.429 --> 24:08.593
Do you agree with that?

24:08.653 --> 24:09.393
I do.

24:09.413 --> 24:15.799
I mean, there are a lot of institutions in the United States that say, I agree with you in principle, but it's very expensive.

24:16.079 --> 24:19.683
We're reaching the point we can't afford to do that anymore.

24:19.703 --> 24:20.143
And you are.

24:20.343 --> 24:22.405
I am finding cases where you see.

24:23.144 --> 24:25.166
that they are swinging.

24:25.346 --> 24:26.687
I mean, they're building buildings.

24:26.727 --> 24:29.109
They're not even called libraries anymore.

24:29.610 --> 24:30.871
You know what they are.

24:30.891 --> 24:35.876
They can get resources and resource centers, blah, blah, blah.

24:35.896 --> 24:36.756
They're not libraries.

24:38.018 --> 24:39.639
And that's really a fundamental change.

24:40.300 --> 24:41.481
I don't know.

24:41.501 --> 24:47.687
I don't know where I'm going with this, but what I see here is very healthy.

24:48.007 --> 24:49.148
Well, it's not right for us.

24:49.168 --> 24:50.429
It's definitely not right for us.

24:50.449 --> 24:52.611
I can't say every library should.

24:53.097 --> 24:55.360
or every university should have the same thing.

24:55.400 --> 24:57.903
Maybe it's right for some smaller places.

24:57.923 --> 25:08.877
But you certainly have achieved a position of preeminence in Canada, and I guess it's important to maintain that position for you.

25:08.957 --> 25:14.224
I think it's actually very rewarding in that people actually use it a lot.

25:14.865 --> 25:18.310
We circulate nearly 7 million items per year.

25:19.010 --> 25:19.191
Wow.

25:19.812 --> 25:21.754
And from my perspective,

25:22.493 --> 25:29.841
That means lots of people are attempting to learn a lot of things.

25:29.861 --> 25:35.767
Yeah, I'm doing an interview Saturday with Martin Gregorian, who I got abroad.

25:35.787 --> 25:40.832
He said, come on down Saturday before he goes to take off to the Carnegie Corporation.

25:40.852 --> 25:44.536
But I think of the nine years, he was abroad.

25:44.757 --> 25:48.501
I don't know the numbers, but he certainly didn't have a library to prepare.

25:48.521 --> 25:49.902
So that's maybe they hadn't been invited.

25:50.607 --> 25:51.909
but I think he tried to double it.

25:51.929 --> 25:59.939
I mean, don't hold me to that figure, but he really actively went out to increase the reading and the holding his books.

25:59.959 --> 26:09.452
And he also commissioned a study, this woman who was dean of, I don't know which she was dean of, but also commissioned a study of what students are reading.

26:09.472 --> 26:10.673
I saw that in the New York Times.

26:10.693 --> 26:18.344
I'm going to ask him about that, you know, to really determine what students are reading in their private life and also, you know, the books that matter, I guess.

26:18.724 --> 26:20.226
I don't know how that relates to

26:20.712 --> 26:25.658
long-term acquisitions, but it is interesting to see how to expect.

26:25.679 --> 26:27.541
I don't want to take up too much of your time.

26:27.581 --> 26:32.247
When I met you, I thought this was a great opportunity to get some comments from you.

26:32.267 --> 26:33.889
Thank you for coming in.

26:33.909 --> 26:35.031
I think it's a great opportunity.

26:35.091 --> 26:38.575
I mean, this really will work its way into this new book I'm working on.

26:38.996 --> 26:41.539
If it's at all possible, maybe I can contact your staff.

26:42.861 --> 26:49.690
If there are any figures of how I would love to have something that might document your holdings in the 50s

26:50.125 --> 26:59.023
and how the decision was made to strive for greatness and how this was reflected in, you know, I mean, I've got figures at Harvard, you know, how the numbers are written.

26:59.043 --> 27:01.808
You see the graph go up like that.

27:02.069 --> 27:07.520
And I'd love to, if you had something comparable that might document that for me, that would be wonderful.

27:08.201 --> 27:08.301
Okay.

27:08.321 --> 27:09.384
Can I give you my card?

27:09.584 --> 27:10.125
I'll do that.

27:10.443 --> 27:15.288
I hate to ask you to do it, but maybe you could have some... Sure, sure, no, no.

27:15.388 --> 27:16.329
It's not that hard to get to.

27:16.349 --> 27:19.312
It would really be very... I'm sorry, it's in my jacket today.

27:21.094 --> 27:22.095
Do you have a card, by the way?

27:22.195 --> 27:23.897
Yes, I do.

27:23.937 --> 27:24.738
We got my database.

27:25.538 --> 27:27.781
See, here I am talking about databases.

27:27.861 --> 27:28.221
I'm sorry.

27:30.464 --> 27:31.104
Just some of them.

27:31.184 --> 27:32.646
Why don't you come back over here close to me?

27:32.686 --> 27:34.788
That is affected me now.

27:34.828 --> 27:35.389
Oh, thanks, Carol.

27:37.471 --> 27:38.712
And thinking about...

27:39.130 --> 27:44.175
What are the possibilities or what the effects of libraries?

27:44.195 --> 27:47.418
I guess all of us had experiences of our own.

27:48.559 --> 28:09.120
When did, I don't know, when you discovered libraries or got this interest in them, but when I was, definitely when I was still in high school and even maybe junior high, I had a few professors who said, well, okay, this is actually in the Sanford area.

28:09.607 --> 28:20.744
that you should actually look more in depth, and they gave you some path to, at that point, what was the local research library that was raised.

28:20.764 --> 28:32.361
And I must say that I was just, you know, I keep thinking back that I was just amazed at the richness of ideas on any particular subject, on whatever it was I was researching.

28:32.381 --> 28:38.550
And it just was so amazing to me as a student at that point.

28:38.834 --> 28:47.607
And I've been really privileged to work in huge research libraries, both Stanford and Columbia here.

28:47.627 --> 28:53.836
You could always search whatever it is interested you.

28:53.856 --> 29:00.727
And working as a reference librarian, you could help other people, you know, look into whatever it is that they were doing.

29:00.747 --> 29:04.352
And they became really excited about that and other people's ideas.

29:05.767 --> 29:14.362
And it's been my goal to make sure that at least every person that goes through the University of Toronto has a chance to experience that if they haven't already.

29:14.602 --> 29:16.986
Because there are many people that come from places where they've never seen us.

29:17.607 --> 29:21.353
Now, an assembly of all of us acknowledged.

29:22.455 --> 29:25.040
And I don't think we've achieved that yet.

29:25.160 --> 29:29.968
It's not easy to do this with the numbers of students in a way that's actually

29:31.535 --> 29:40.205
a personal good experience so that you have the kind of piece and contemplation and all of the materials that you could do at those private universities.

29:40.225 --> 29:46.893
But that's what we're trying to do, and I think we've made fun, and we certainly have the support of our faculty.

29:47.714 --> 29:48.675
That's great.

29:48.695 --> 29:53.261
And of course, when you say building collections, you don't just go out and buy books.

29:53.281 --> 29:53.561
Right.

29:53.581 --> 29:54.803
The stores are there.

29:54.963 --> 29:57.005
You say, well, give me one of that, one of that.

29:57.306 --> 29:59.048
You certainly have to talk to your faculty.

29:59.228 --> 29:59.348
Right.

29:59.733 --> 30:09.003
And I mean, it's got to be a very systematic, intelligent program of strengthening the collections in the areas where they're needed.

30:09.023 --> 30:13.728
And I suppose that you get that kind of a recognition from the faculty.

30:14.228 --> 30:14.989
So it seems to me.

30:15.009 --> 30:15.930
Right.

30:15.950 --> 30:18.533
So when you build in collections, it is an intelligent thing.

30:18.553 --> 30:28.744
Well, in fact, a lot of the collections have been built by faculty with their own collections, and they give them at the end of their careers.

30:29.180 --> 30:37.448
because they don't really have anybody to pass them on to and they want to pass them on to the students in the future.

30:37.468 --> 30:37.728
Thank you.

30:37.748 --> 30:41.812
So that's really been, that's what fills a lot of the Fisher and a lot of our library as well.

30:41.832 --> 30:43.114
It's a beautiful facility that is.

30:43.134 --> 30:43.234
Yeah.

30:43.494 --> 30:43.934
Fisher.

30:43.954 --> 30:44.095
Yeah.

30:44.555 --> 30:50.481
And I have to tell you, Richard has the, I mean, it's the first time I've met him once briefly in New York.

30:50.501 --> 30:54.805
But he has the respect of everybody, I have to tell you.

30:54.825 --> 30:57.267
We're very lucky to have him.

30:57.388 --> 30:58.849
He's highly, highly regarded.

30:59.335 --> 31:04.825
Well, we're trying to keep him here.

31:04.845 --> 31:11.436
He's done a terrific job for him.

31:11.516 --> 31:17.828
I just can't tell you the respect and admiration.

31:17.848 --> 31:19.330
Holding in your hands what, Richard?

31:19.430 --> 31:19.791
We're not.

31:20.108 --> 31:23.512
What do you call this level, this level one?

31:23.932 --> 31:26.335
This is actually the second floor.

31:26.735 --> 31:28.517
So you don't actually have formal dedicated?

31:28.637 --> 31:32.902
No, they're called the mezzanines, first mezzanine.

31:32.922 --> 31:33.563
Oh, nice, okay.

31:33.583 --> 31:35.665
Second mezzanine, third mezzanine.

31:35.685 --> 31:37.207
So we're on the first mezzanine?

31:37.227 --> 31:40.250
Well, we're really the first mezzanine's one above here.

31:40.670 --> 31:41.992
Okay.

31:42.092 --> 31:45.456
You're holding a 1425, about roughly.

31:45.476 --> 31:45.616
Okay.

31:45.996 --> 31:48.139
Yeah, Parisian book of ours.

31:49.340 --> 31:49.440
Sure.

31:49.943 --> 32:03.520
decorated by, well, John Plummer saw photographs of this and said, aha, the atelier of the Bedford Master.

32:05.302 --> 32:16.035
But I had a student who did some work on this one time, and she said it wasn't the Bedford Master at all.

32:16.387 --> 32:17.348
somebody else.

32:17.368 --> 32:23.775
But art historians, of course, can't sleep at night unless they attribute things to somebody.

32:24.296 --> 32:25.778
Look at the detail.

32:25.858 --> 32:27.540
Has there ever been a facsimile in this?

32:27.620 --> 32:27.720
No.

32:28.000 --> 32:32.345
It's very fresh because it was in a private collection in Germany for 300 years.

32:32.886 --> 32:33.586
God, look at that.

32:33.927 --> 32:42.917
The binding is prison, but later, 1590, we got it down to from these tools.

32:43.690 --> 32:48.657
It possibly was earlier bound in velvet or something like that.

32:49.338 --> 32:51.922
But I'll see if I can find her name.

32:53.063 --> 32:54.185
Now, who is she?

32:54.205 --> 32:55.567
She's the person who did what?

32:55.587 --> 32:57.049
She owned it, I believe.

32:57.990 --> 33:00.013
Her name was Jean, or Jean.

33:00.253 --> 33:03.097
Are these signed illuminations at all?

33:03.118 --> 33:03.358
No.

33:03.378 --> 33:04.099
Do we know the artist?

33:04.119 --> 33:04.540
We don't.

33:04.820 --> 33:05.040
No.

33:05.381 --> 33:12.651
It's only, it'll be the, it's somebody of, this is the same quality as the Bedford.

33:13.171 --> 33:15.934
We don't even know his name.

33:16.295 --> 33:25.405
If this were to be removed in another context, this would be an artwork of major significance, wouldn't it?

33:25.445 --> 33:26.266
That's what it is.

33:26.326 --> 33:27.788
Nobody cares about the text.

33:27.808 --> 33:34.536
It's just another book of ours, about the use of parents.

33:37.059 --> 33:42.385
Jacqueline, her name is Jacqueline de Bufy.

33:43.006 --> 33:48.293
and then there's the name of the house.

33:48.573 --> 33:51.237
So she was the person for whom this was made, isn't it?

33:51.257 --> 33:55.723
I would guess that probably it was commissioned by her father.

33:55.763 --> 34:02.071
She was obviously from a wealthy family, and probably when she took her final vows, this was her gift.

34:02.292 --> 34:04.174
Now, she obviously didn't read it very much.

34:05.015 --> 34:10.523
I mean, some books of ours are summed, but, of course, you shouldn't have to read the hours.

34:10.563 --> 34:12.405
You're meant to know them.

34:13.010 --> 34:16.735
So it's a kind of, it's a religious object.

34:17.036 --> 34:18.438
How did it make its way here?

34:19.119 --> 34:24.547
It came here, it's on deposit here, from a German collection.

34:27.331 --> 34:28.112
From Germany?

34:28.132 --> 34:29.153
Yeah.

34:29.614 --> 34:32.598
That's wonderful that they chose Toronto.

34:32.618 --> 34:35.142
Yeah, that happened quite a long time ago.

34:35.202 --> 34:39.729
It's been in Toronto since the 70s.

34:39.749 --> 34:42.613
This is the Catholic Army.

34:42.653 --> 34:42.713
Oh.

34:43.638 --> 34:53.115
They should give you some tables up here, where you don't run the risk of your... Sorry.

34:53.135 --> 35:06.338
It's a wonderful coffee because it's in a 17th-century binding that's very plain.

35:06.824 --> 35:10.830
And it's been bound so that you can actually see the cancel.

35:10.990 --> 35:19.303
And one of the points of this, the question about this is the paper.

35:19.644 --> 35:28.037
You can see the watermarks very clearly here.

35:29.439 --> 35:35.228
They're all bull's head stars, which is the first sort.

35:36.220 --> 35:48.011
controversy about this says right here, 1460.

35:49.693 --> 35:53.577
And La Guntina, Mainz.

35:55.959 --> 36:02.305
And this is generally presumed to be from Gutenberg's press.

36:02.785 --> 36:05.468
Gutenberg didn't die until 1468.

36:05.752 --> 36:08.154
His type, and his present is type, I guess.

36:08.174 --> 36:08.434
That's right.

36:09.595 --> 36:34.797
Now, the question is, there's three different sorts of papers in this, and it's thought that possibly 14, well, this is a controversy fought out in the Gutenberg-Yar book on an annual basis by Lottie, Helen Gove, Paul Needham, with now some intervention from a guy from Buchenwald, who came here and spent a week

36:35.097 --> 36:35.918
with this book.

36:36.399 --> 36:37.740
Now, Lottie's seen it.

36:37.820 --> 36:42.486
Now, why this book as opposed to... Well, this was a copy that had never been used before.

36:42.506 --> 36:44.909
It had never been looked at by these people.

36:44.989 --> 36:46.751
Paul's never seen this.

36:46.771 --> 36:48.894
He knows it's here, but... Has he been?

36:49.435 --> 36:51.878
No, but Lottie has.

36:51.898 --> 36:53.640
Can I see the famous colophon on this?

36:53.700 --> 37:00.929
Isn't this the one that said... Isn't this the book that has the colophon that this was done by Stylus?

37:02.010 --> 37:04.193
Oh, it does go on a bit, yes.

37:04.780 --> 37:15.973
That's fine.

37:16.713 --> 37:27.986
It's done mechanically and not with the... To the glory of God and all that other stuff.

37:30.128 --> 37:33.132
But some people have thought... That's wonderful.

37:33.152 --> 37:34.213
...that this really...

37:34.514 --> 37:38.519
It means 1460s, not just 1460s.

37:39.560 --> 37:42.924
But I don't know enough about it.

37:43.285 --> 37:44.186
What's the seal?

37:44.466 --> 37:54.238
Oh, that's the arms of the Palmersfeld and the Schoenborn family.

37:56.181 --> 38:02.749
And there's the other interesting thing about these, which Lottie Hellinger is the one who knows all about this.

38:02.999 --> 38:06.244
these initials, these pen and ink initials.

38:06.264 --> 38:11.752
She can actually identify, in some cases, the shops that these were done in.

38:13.154 --> 38:15.517
So they would send these sheets over to this?

38:15.938 --> 38:16.278
Yeah.

38:16.639 --> 38:22.948
In Mainz, there were illuminators and decorators who did these kinds of things.

38:23.198 --> 38:25.841
Now, what's rubrication?

38:26.542 --> 38:30.667
Well, rubrication is all the red bits.

38:30.727 --> 38:34.672
Literally, rubricate means to mark in red, although they use blue.

38:34.832 --> 38:36.794
But those have been done in different shops?

38:37.094 --> 38:44.123
No, they'd probably all be done in the same shop, but a different person would do the really fancy stuff.

38:45.124 --> 38:47.687
And then...

38:48.022 --> 38:51.265
But sheaths could be sent, of course, all over Europe.

38:51.305 --> 38:53.468
What are these symbols?

38:53.628 --> 38:57.532
I think that just means part two, book two.

38:58.293 --> 38:59.674
It looks like it was done yesterday.

38:59.754 --> 39:06.361
The paper is incredible.

39:06.662 --> 39:12.208
But this is a great copy for a scholar because it's not in a fancy binding.

39:12.788 --> 39:17.353
If you go to the morgue and look at theirs, either it's in some kind of beauty

39:17.789 --> 39:21.755
fancy contemporary bindings, so they'll only let you open it this far.

39:22.957 --> 39:24.138
In other words, in terms of access?

39:24.279 --> 39:24.899
Yeah.

39:24.919 --> 39:29.546
Well, in terms of being able to see the physical evidence, it's got cancels in it.

39:29.566 --> 39:35.074
But what you're saying to me is that because of a fancy, fancy binding, the scholar can't see the text.

39:35.174 --> 39:35.575
That's right.

39:35.595 --> 39:39.220
It's pretty... It's kind of ironical when you come right down on it, isn't it?

39:39.681 --> 39:40.122
Yeah, sure.

39:40.142 --> 39:41.704
Well, there have been books...

39:42.038 --> 39:48.584
I mean, one collection that the University of Virginia has, which is binding... No, it's actually... It's winning.

39:48.664 --> 39:49.765
It's winning.

39:52.108 --> 39:56.992
The date of gift specifically says that one book cannot be opened.

39:57.012 --> 39:57.673
You're kidding.

39:57.693 --> 39:58.614
This is at Virginia?

39:58.794 --> 39:59.214
Yeah.

39:59.234 --> 40:00.195
Do you know what book it is?

40:00.255 --> 40:04.199
I can't remember the date of the collection.

40:04.219 --> 40:04.840
No, that's Terry.

40:04.880 --> 40:06.261
Terry would know, huh?

40:06.281 --> 40:10.225
Terry would know, yeah.

40:10.245 --> 40:11.286
U-V-A...

40:11.553 --> 40:12.194
has a book.

40:13.376 --> 40:14.417
I believe that's right.

40:15.619 --> 40:21.727
That Deed of Gift says can't be opened.

40:21.747 --> 40:24.070
You know, it's obviously a European book?

40:24.090 --> 40:27.936
Yeah, it's a 17th century book, I think.

40:27.956 --> 40:30.479
Because, of course, there's strength as an American down there.

40:30.519 --> 40:30.960
Wonderful.

40:31.701 --> 40:31.961
Yeah.

40:32.262 --> 40:36.127
No, this is just a group.

40:36.147 --> 40:37.749
The whole group can't be opened?

40:37.809 --> 40:40.513
No, I think it's this...

40:40.932 --> 40:45.219
My recollection is that it applies specifically to this one book.

40:46.421 --> 40:49.587
This is some of the teasing stuff.

40:49.607 --> 41:06.636
I'm going to find one with decorations.

41:13.838 --> 41:22.647
But these are, this, I've forgotten the date.

41:22.707 --> 41:29.174
I'd have to look at the list unless somebody's maybe written it in for me.

41:29.374 --> 41:30.615
What happened to it?

41:30.635 --> 41:40.926
Well, it's been damaged because, of course, early Hebrew manuscripts normally are, well, many of them have perished, of course,

41:41.783 --> 41:47.830
But when you see them, they often are damaged because they've had a tough time through the century.

41:48.630 --> 41:49.191
But here it is.

41:49.431 --> 41:51.233
But here it is.

41:56.118 --> 42:01.704
So, now, are these parts of... This is the Freedberg collection.

42:01.765 --> 42:02.285
Oh, yeah.

42:02.305 --> 42:04.067
Here's one of those pages.

42:04.087 --> 42:09.613
So, I mean, there are many things here for a scholar to... Oh, yeah.

42:09.813 --> 42:18.642
They had, there's already people have been here from New York, Philadelphia, Jerusalem.

42:19.082 --> 42:20.564
They know this stuff exists.

42:20.944 --> 42:22.866
And this is what Gail was talking about yesterday.

42:23.266 --> 42:23.687
Yeah.

42:23.727 --> 42:29.052
The guy, you know, these things are so important.

42:29.352 --> 42:36.359
Now is this stuff that you as an institution went out and acquired or kind of came your way through the beneficence of a collector?

42:36.539 --> 42:37.440
These are prayers.

42:37.808 --> 42:40.733
Because that's all text.

42:41.053 --> 42:43.597
You know, there's prescription against images.

42:44.358 --> 42:50.488
So the decorations done with text, some of them are very elaborate style games.

42:53.212 --> 42:54.073
How old roughly?

42:54.915 --> 42:57.058
This one I think is 13th century.

42:57.979 --> 43:06.212
But there's a fragment here that is 9th century, I think.

43:07.728 --> 43:26.579
There's an 11th century fragment.

43:27.020 --> 43:34.512
But there's one of them that if the dating is right, it's the earliest surviving Hebrew.

43:34.880 --> 43:35.941
This is?

43:36.102 --> 43:36.983
Not this one.

43:37.003 --> 43:38.525
It's another one.

43:38.545 --> 43:39.426
That's pretty old, though.

43:39.527 --> 43:40.548
Even earlier, yeah.

43:41.970 --> 43:47.037
Well, when you say earlier surviving, what roughly?

43:47.438 --> 43:54.588
I think it's the date, the provisional date, but of course they're arguing about it, is 841.

43:57.732 --> 43:58.473
What's the surface?

43:58.533 --> 43:59.875
Is it paper or vellum?

43:59.895 --> 44:00.456
No, it's vellum.

44:00.476 --> 44:01.157
Vellum, yeah.

44:06.537 --> 44:10.562
You're flipping through fragments here.

44:11.203 --> 44:14.047
This early thing is probably preserved in bindings.

44:15.569 --> 44:18.112
But this is an incredible collection.

44:19.133 --> 44:20.575
So the name of this collection?

44:20.615 --> 44:22.157
Friedberg.

44:22.177 --> 44:24.901
Albert Friedberg.

44:24.921 --> 44:29.287
And Albert Friedberg was... He's a Toronto businessman.

44:29.427 --> 44:30.708
He's a currency trader.

44:30.889 --> 44:32.971
Did he collect these or he funded them?

44:33.111 --> 44:35.054
He's collected them.

44:35.154 --> 44:35.835
He reads them.

44:36.423 --> 44:42.052
He's a serious scholar in the sense that... Is he still alive?

44:42.072 --> 44:42.252
Oh, yeah.

44:43.073 --> 44:43.734
He's in his 50s, I guess.

44:43.834 --> 44:44.095
Really?

44:44.115 --> 44:45.276
A young guy?

44:45.336 --> 44:45.597
Yeah.

44:45.657 --> 44:48.321
And so this stuff... He's got lots more.

44:48.381 --> 44:51.866
So one hopes you'll get more.

44:52.367 --> 44:54.490
Yeah, that's right.

44:54.510 --> 45:04.185
I think part of his motivation was that scholars knew that he had this stuff, and they wanted to get access to it.

45:04.756 --> 45:19.691
And we really got on to him because our Hebrew guy, who works here part-time, tried to arrange to have a microfilm made for someone in Jerusalem.

45:19.731 --> 45:21.974
See, just anticipating what happened.

45:22.434 --> 45:24.456
And approached Friedberg.

45:24.777 --> 45:28.380
And I guess he'd probably been approached before as well.

45:28.520 --> 45:33.025
And then he started thinking about maybe this stuff should be in an accessible place.

45:33.427 --> 45:35.891
He can't deal with scholars in his house.

45:35.991 --> 45:39.316
Well, his house is big enough to hold many scholars.

45:39.336 --> 45:42.480
He's got a professional research library here.

45:42.741 --> 45:43.682
That's right.

45:43.702 --> 45:48.369
You want to help as far as you can, but you can't have a reason to grab your door every day.

45:48.389 --> 45:49.170
That's right.

45:49.190 --> 45:51.053
Do you foresee this stuff being scanned?

45:52.275 --> 45:54.779
Oh, yeah, quite possibly, yeah.

45:54.799 --> 46:03.231
I mean, I think scanning technology, when it gets to the point where it can handle an external lens,

46:03.987 --> 46:06.932
You know, we have an archivist photocopier with the cradle.

46:07.032 --> 46:07.312
Right.

46:07.853 --> 46:10.137
When we can do that without scanning?

46:10.297 --> 46:11.119
Without physically?

46:11.139 --> 46:11.279
Yeah.

46:11.620 --> 46:14.444
And they claim that exists.

46:14.464 --> 46:18.190
I mean, Minolta and so on will phone you and tell you it exists.

46:19.472 --> 46:24.841
I'm next door where they do the scanning, and they have a big digitizing project.

46:24.861 --> 46:25.643
Oh, does it?

46:25.663 --> 46:26.404
Toronto does.

46:26.464 --> 46:28.808
It's been done through preservation.

46:28.828 --> 46:28.948
Right.

46:29.485 --> 46:34.751
They say that actually the external lens isn't good enough yet.

46:35.192 --> 46:36.773
Of archival quality.

46:36.793 --> 46:37.394
That's right.

46:37.514 --> 46:43.201
But when it is, then it'll take over from microfilm.

46:43.221 --> 46:45.504
So where are they doing this physically?

46:45.524 --> 46:45.924
Next door?

46:45.984 --> 46:46.725
Next door, yes.

46:46.785 --> 46:48.928
And what kinds of things are they scanning?

46:48.948 --> 46:52.171
Well, they're doing two kinds of things.

46:52.271 --> 46:54.434
Books that have totally fallen apart.

46:54.454 --> 46:55.375
Is there something I can see?

46:55.777 --> 46:58.221
This is a lock, so it doesn't have to be formal.

46:58.722 --> 47:00.546
We can go over there, sure.

47:00.566 --> 47:01.447
Let me show you this.

47:01.868 --> 47:15.974
I don't mean right now, I mean just... Okay, this is kind of... Can you just play with these things, just enjoy them?

47:16.254 --> 47:16.755
Sure.

47:17.377 --> 47:21.202
When I think that, I actually lose myself in the stack sometimes.

47:21.483 --> 47:22.624
Are you just talking about this?

47:22.704 --> 47:28.973
This is the ninth edition of Grey's Elegy, but it says from KL Neptune at sea.

47:29.453 --> 47:34.780
KL is Catherine Lowther, and she was... Catherine Lowther.

47:35.441 --> 47:37.444
L-O-W-T-H-E-R.

47:37.913 --> 47:45.623
who was James Wolfe's fiancée, or at least he thought she was his fiancée.

47:45.763 --> 47:50.710
Neptune is the name of the ship he came to North America on, to Halifax.

47:51.852 --> 47:54.355
So this is an association copy of some note?

47:54.375 --> 47:55.837
Well, yeah.

47:56.818 --> 48:00.223
The paths of glory lead but to the grave is underlined.

48:01.304 --> 48:07.212
There's one of Wolfe's notes, how ineffectual are often our own unaided

48:07.563 --> 48:10.387
exertions, especially in early light.

48:10.888 --> 48:11.509
Question mark.

48:11.649 --> 48:16.917
Most of these notes... Can you do the whole thing?

48:18.159 --> 48:28.696
How many shining lights owe to patronage and affluence what their talents would never procure them?

48:29.056 --> 48:30.318
So what's the significance of this?

48:30.378 --> 48:34.785
Well, he's complaining about not advancing fast enough in the army

48:35.272 --> 48:42.983
There's other people because they have more powerful patrons and so on, and the aristocracy get preferment and so on.

48:43.423 --> 48:48.550
Now, this is written by a man who's the commander of the British forces in North America.

48:48.951 --> 48:51.595
Because, once again... James Wolfe.

48:51.795 --> 48:53.157
General James Wolfe.

48:53.557 --> 48:54.859
Spelled W-O-L-F-E.

48:55.921 --> 48:59.465
And... Mark Tom and Wolfe are just the same Wolfe.

48:59.546 --> 49:00.367
That's it.

49:00.387 --> 49:02.169
Died on the Plains of Abraham.

49:03.171 --> 49:04.232
He's 31.

49:04.921 --> 49:08.746
one would have thought that his advancement, in fact, had been pretty good.

49:10.328 --> 49:14.814
So he then goes on to Quebec.

49:15.735 --> 49:16.857
This feels so important.

49:16.977 --> 49:18.038
Scales the cliffs.

49:18.940 --> 49:33.679
And, in fact, the legend has it that on the eve of the battle, while he rowed up the river, Wolfe repeated from memory grazelegy, which...

49:33.946 --> 49:44.735
if you read it more than twice, you've memorized this practically, and said, I would rather have written that poem than beat the French tomorrow.

49:46.297 --> 49:46.457
Come on.

49:46.677 --> 49:48.339
That's the legend.

49:48.399 --> 49:51.221
This is a very, very important book.

49:51.241 --> 49:52.022
Of course it is.

49:52.262 --> 49:55.665
This is our seven millionth volume.

49:56.386 --> 49:58.047
Well, let me just give it a touch.

49:58.187 --> 49:58.427
Yeah.

49:58.668 --> 50:03.632
We got this because...

50:04.304 --> 50:31.932
I was asked by the Friends Steering Committee to find a 7 millionth volume for, this was many years ago, several years ago, and I guess they thought that I'd find, you know, a nice and cumulable for $25,000 or so, but I happen to know the existence of this because it was owned by Edwin Wolfe's brother, Roberts,

50:32.485 --> 50:37.291
And it came into that family because, well... So it was in the U.S.?

50:37.311 --> 50:37.652
Oh, yeah.

50:37.812 --> 50:46.122
The provenance of it was that after the battle, Wolf's body was sent back, and this book was sent back.

50:46.182 --> 50:47.945
Now, he didn't have this on the battlefield.

50:47.965 --> 50:48.646
Sent back to where?

50:48.686 --> 50:55.354
To England with his body, and was given back to Catherine Louder.

50:55.857 --> 50:58.620
Catherine K-A-T-H-A-R-I-N-E.

50:58.640 --> 50:59.201
I'll check it out.

50:59.221 --> 51:00.623
There must be a book of biography.

51:00.643 --> 51:02.705
This has been written out.

51:02.905 --> 51:06.570
This is the kind of thing I use.

51:06.690 --> 51:07.671
This is great.

51:07.991 --> 51:11.436
It's what a book tells you beyond what it tells you.

51:11.456 --> 51:19.345
There's a bit in that article I did in Bibbio, I think, although it's probably not after Amy rewrote it.

51:20.667 --> 51:23.850
Ask me about being edited by Bibbio when we have a free moment.

51:23.911 --> 51:25.172
Catherine Mather

51:25.625 --> 51:30.430
then married Harry Pollack.

51:30.490 --> 51:33.293
So it has his book, Duke of Bolton.

51:33.393 --> 51:34.995
C-O-W-L-E-T.

51:36.136 --> 51:43.084
She became the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, and she died in 189.

51:43.164 --> 51:45.026
She outlived Bolton by 50 years.

51:46.448 --> 51:51.113
Well, did she retain an affection for him, do you think?

51:51.133 --> 51:51.413
Certainly.

51:51.493 --> 51:51.934
I don't know.

51:51.954 --> 51:54.957
There was a big row in the family about this...

51:55.544 --> 52:06.118
portrait of her that Wolfe had that he had commissioned a special frame with brilliant teams and his mother didn't want to pay for it.

52:07.179 --> 52:14.970
Anyway, she gave it to her personal maid as a souvenir of the great general Wolfe.

52:15.230 --> 52:22.239
The maid gave it to her daughter, she gave it to her daughter, and it then disappeared into France.

52:22.259 --> 52:23.661
It turned up and

52:24.367 --> 52:29.854
Rouen or somewhere in France at the end of the century.

52:29.914 --> 52:35.902
It ended up in London in 1912 when it was looked at by Beckles Wilson.

52:35.982 --> 52:44.513
Did you think all these owners along the way had any concept of the significance of this?

52:46.635 --> 52:47.076
Oh, I think so.

52:47.096 --> 52:53.344
Then it was sold to Rosenbach in 1916 for $5,000.

52:54.117 --> 53:01.787
and was bought from Rosenbach by his cousin, who was also his attorney.

53:02.348 --> 53:06.353
His name was Wolf, and that was Edwin's father.

53:07.614 --> 53:13.922
Edwin's father lived into his 90s, very old.

53:14.603 --> 53:16.426
Edwin made 80, 82.

53:16.526 --> 53:19.129
No more than that.

53:19.345 --> 53:22.809
He was, you know, Edwin was the best man at our wedding.

53:22.829 --> 53:23.350
I didn't know.

53:23.590 --> 53:24.752
That makes perfect sense.

53:24.872 --> 53:26.474
He said it the first time.

53:28.036 --> 53:28.236
Sorry.

53:29.117 --> 53:30.239
You can't come in here.

53:31.480 --> 53:32.902
The door shouldn't be unlocked.

53:35.946 --> 53:42.334
Yeah, he said it was the first time he'd been your best man since 1935.

53:44.897 --> 53:45.417
That's funny.

53:45.437 --> 53:49.082
Anyway, I think Rosenbach sold it to...

53:49.433 --> 53:53.879
Edwin's father, based pretty much entirely on the name Wolf to Wolf.

53:54.420 --> 53:55.702
They're still in existence.

53:55.862 --> 54:04.915
In fact, Robert Wolf still owns the portrait of General Wolf that Clarence Wolf, who's a cousin, who's McManus.

54:04.935 --> 54:05.676
Who's McManus, right.

54:05.696 --> 54:06.538
He was trying to sell.

54:06.598 --> 54:08.961
He was trying to flog it to me last time I was down there.

54:09.397 --> 54:19.206
So I went down, I phoned Edwin and said, is there any chance your brother might be willing to part with this great elegy?

54:19.226 --> 54:21.849
He said, sure, I'll ask him, so he asked him.

54:21.869 --> 54:26.073
And he said yes, and the only question was the price.

54:26.093 --> 54:32.299
So Clarence and I negotiated the price, and I paid $325,000 U.S.

54:32.499 --> 54:36.383
dollars, which was almost 400,000 Canadians.

54:36.937 --> 54:40.983
And I can tell you all this because it got leaked to the press.

54:41.163 --> 54:44.148
It was reported, and there was a great fuss.

54:45.510 --> 54:53.302
But the money all came from a federal fund for repatriating Canadian treasures.

54:53.482 --> 54:55.265
Three-quarters of it came from there.

54:55.325 --> 55:00.472
The other quarter, the friends raised, so it didn't actually cost the institution anything.

55:00.512 --> 55:01.594
It's not many ways to do it.

55:01.793 --> 55:05.918
No, you're preaching to the choir now.

55:07.660 --> 55:09.042
I think it's where, what's money?

55:09.162 --> 55:10.944
Like the guy says in Texas, he says, what's money?

55:11.305 --> 55:14.569
They go out and they buy a machine one day that's obsolete for $5 million.

55:14.709 --> 55:15.970
And what the hell is that?

55:16.071 --> 55:16.711
What good is that?

55:16.771 --> 55:17.292
These books?

55:17.813 --> 55:18.534
This box.

55:18.554 --> 55:21.177
It's a national treasure, isn't it?

55:21.197 --> 55:23.700
And of course, what does the biographer learn?

55:24.322 --> 55:33.993
This is an essential... Well, you know at least that Wolfe may or may not have repeated Graves Ellery on the eve of the battle, but you know he read the poem.

55:34.013 --> 55:34.333
Sure.

55:34.514 --> 55:36.616
And you were saying something about the box, I interrupted you.

55:36.636 --> 55:37.777
Oh, that was made here.

55:38.038 --> 55:43.844
I'll show you our conservation panel.

55:43.864 --> 55:45.766
Because that's pretty interesting, too.

55:45.786 --> 55:46.607
That was wonderful.

55:47.248 --> 55:48.950
That was the seven millionth book.

55:48.970 --> 55:50.892
Did you also choose the eight millionth?

55:50.912 --> 55:51.152
Yeah.

55:51.172 --> 55:51.913
Well, that was what?

55:52.534 --> 55:53.535
That was...

55:54.494 --> 55:59.302
Well, for the 8 million, actually, I got a little more inspired.

55:59.342 --> 56:05.192
I knew they would be nervous about me buying something.

56:05.453 --> 56:11.543
So I got a donated thing, and it's Sloan's History of Jamaica.

56:13.647 --> 56:19.978
But the great thing, in fact, is the 8 million and first volumes,

56:20.431 --> 56:24.296
which was the Cologne Chronicle, 1499.

56:24.336 --> 56:30.765
Nice copy, and much, much rarer than the Nuremberg Chronicle, which we have two.

56:31.906 --> 56:43.822
And then the eight million and second volume was the only Jane Austen we didn't have, the one that Gail mentioned, George Cagall.

56:44.362 --> 56:45.544
The eight million and

56:45.980 --> 56:52.310
The third was a five-page holograph letter of Galileo.

56:53.052 --> 56:56.257
There are only three Galileo letters in North America.

56:56.778 --> 56:58.060
Where are the other two?

56:58.240 --> 56:59.743
Curiously, in Philadelphia.

57:00.183 --> 57:01.225
No, sorry, there are four.

57:01.466 --> 57:02.487
Dibner has one.

57:02.908 --> 57:03.809
Dibner, who's the Dibner?

57:03.829 --> 57:07.836
Bern Dibner, Berndy Library, Norwalk, Connecticut.

57:08.525 --> 57:10.127
What library is that?

57:10.327 --> 57:11.449
Science, history, science.

57:11.669 --> 57:12.470
Most of the books.

57:12.590 --> 57:13.351
What's that library?

57:13.411 --> 57:14.773
The book's out of the Smithsonian.

57:14.973 --> 57:15.534
Okay.

57:15.554 --> 57:17.437
It's the Burndy Library.

57:17.737 --> 57:19.720
B-E-R-N-B-U-R-N-D-Y.

57:19.960 --> 57:22.243
It's the name of Dibner's company.

57:22.263 --> 57:26.328
And his name is Burnd, B-E-R-N, Dibner.

57:27.870 --> 57:29.453
I think he's now dead.

57:29.893 --> 57:31.736
The Scientific Library in Norwalk?

57:32.697 --> 57:33.798
Norwalk, Connecticut.

57:34.419 --> 57:35.140
How did this thing go?

57:35.508 --> 57:39.993
He lived in Norwalk, Connecticut.

57:40.934 --> 57:46.019
Well, I'm not sure what's still there because a lot of stuff went to the Smithsonian.

57:48.081 --> 57:56.150
But the other two Galileo letters are in the Historical Society of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

57:57.191 --> 58:01.215
They're in the grass collection of autographs.

58:01.695 --> 58:05.059
And the amusing thing about that, you mentioned legacies of genius.

58:05.748 --> 58:06.689
last night.

58:06.849 --> 58:10.453
Well, Marie, she did that.

58:10.473 --> 58:16.098
That's why I nodded to her when I met you.

58:16.359 --> 58:20.223
One of the things they wanted to exhibit was the Galileo letter.

58:21.884 --> 58:25.388
They were going to illustrate it in the catalog.

58:26.789 --> 58:27.650
But they had two.

58:28.271 --> 58:30.473
So I was visiting Marie

58:31.128 --> 58:33.591
when the catalog was in proof.

58:34.032 --> 58:48.773
She showed me the proof of it, and I'm looking through it, and I come to Galileo, and I look at the description, and then I look at the facsimile, and I said, hang on, this description does not match this facsimile.

58:48.993 --> 58:50.135
They pulled the wrong letter.

58:50.175 --> 58:52.077
I guess they don't read Italian very well.

58:52.318 --> 58:54.621
That's a historical society in Pennsylvania.

58:55.342 --> 59:00.409
So they actually had to tip in the first printing of that catalog,

59:00.811 --> 59:07.383
What they did, in fact, is they didn't cancel it, but they photographed the real letter.

59:08.265 --> 59:20.127
So the first issue of that catalog should have both Galileo letters illustrated, but only one described.

59:20.147 --> 59:21.570
No, actually...

59:22.360 --> 59:25.786
General Madness started with the Legacies of Genius exhibition.

59:26.067 --> 59:27.890
That's a great exhibition.

59:28.051 --> 59:28.792
Yeah, absolutely.

59:28.812 --> 59:29.734
I'll show you.

59:29.754 --> 59:33.140
It started the course of events that culminated in that book.

59:33.300 --> 59:34.102
I'll show you that.

59:36.326 --> 59:37.829
That is great.

59:37.849 --> 59:43.339
I'm going to turn this on the other side.
