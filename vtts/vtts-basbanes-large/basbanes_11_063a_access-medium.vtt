WEBVTT

00:02.917 --> 00:07.381
It's 8th October, and we're in your car.

00:07.421 --> 00:08.582
Where are we driving?

00:08.602 --> 00:12.046
Just to give me a... We're heading east on Caramont Boulevard.

00:12.066 --> 00:17.591
And we're in Shankar, or... No, we're still in Cog and County.

00:19.052 --> 00:26.059
And we're heading into from, you might say, Beechwood into Hunting Valley now.

00:26.079 --> 00:30.663
I mean, you could be, as far as I'm concerned, in a New England town or a village right now.

00:30.683 --> 00:30.763
Yes.

00:31.081 --> 00:35.447
I'm looking at splendid fall foliage and old cemetery off to the right.

00:35.928 --> 00:42.717
I see no evidence of skyscrapers or air pollution or urban discord or anything.

00:42.737 --> 00:43.858
You won't see any.

00:44.099 --> 00:52.330
I could be in, as you said earlier before I put the tape recorder on, this is like an overgrown farm village, is your phrase.

00:52.765 --> 00:56.118
and now I feel like I'm out in the country.

00:56.138 --> 01:03.788
We have everything that every New England city could possibly have, from the orchestra, the arts, to the universities, to the...

01:04.072 --> 01:08.459
Museum of Natural History, the historical theme.

01:08.479 --> 01:11.904
All of that you'll see tomorrow with Bob Schutcher.

01:11.924 --> 01:22.941
He's going to take you through the University of Ontario and to downtown Cleveland, the Chrysler Klaus Bookstore and the Cleveland Public Library, which is well, you know,

01:22.921 --> 01:24.423
Not as much as they should.

01:24.443 --> 01:28.710
I didn't realize that it was about the second or third largest in the United States.

01:28.730 --> 01:31.994
After the NYPL, you know, which is, you know, a class by itself.

01:32.215 --> 01:35.500
I'm sorry, are you going to say something?

01:35.520 --> 01:36.802
No, they had the library.

01:37.342 --> 01:46.236
Whether it's the library or the museum in Cleveland, our team ranks right up there in the top half dozen in the country.

01:46.256 --> 01:49.941
And the same with the historical and the garden centers.

01:53.077 --> 02:15.405
I'm a book finder.

02:15.385 --> 02:18.149
I want to be known as Buckley.

02:18.169 --> 02:22.315
And I ran a big machine shop that did nuclear work with the Navy.

02:22.376 --> 02:26.862
We made the gut part that went into all the reactors and the tax-ups.

02:26.882 --> 02:30.047
You split your hair 20, 30 times and hold it.

02:30.067 --> 02:32.330
I'm an old naval officer, I have to say.

02:32.631 --> 02:41.264
And I've been up to Droughton and Newport and places like that, watch the assemblies and things.

02:41.284 --> 02:44.008
Now, of course, they're not doing anymore.

02:44.917 --> 02:50.163
What shall I say, I close that company down, and I have a little injection molding company now.

02:52.245 --> 02:55.549
So, but you say... But I'm a bookbinder at heart.

02:55.649 --> 02:59.773
But you're a bookbinder at heart, and do you... Look at this, are these horse farms out here?

02:59.793 --> 03:02.857
Yeah, I'm going to, we're just going to take a little left here.

03:02.877 --> 03:03.337
Isn't it beautiful?

03:03.417 --> 03:04.899
It's really gorgeous.

03:04.919 --> 03:08.202
Fairmount, F-A-I-R-M-O-U-N-T Boulevard.

03:09.123 --> 03:11.566
And we're at the corner of Chagrin, Chagrin, C-H-A-G.

03:11.586 --> 03:12.787
Chagrin River, yeah.

03:12.887 --> 03:13.388
River Road.

03:13.773 --> 03:20.526
This is Hunting Valley, and if we go left, we're going to go into Gates Mills.

03:21.451 --> 03:22.992
We're going to come back.

03:23.032 --> 03:32.261
We're running way early, and I know Jan well enough that I said 11 o'clock, and we will be there at 11 o'clock.

03:32.281 --> 03:34.162
We come in at 20 of 11.

03:34.182 --> 03:36.364
He's not going to be ready for us.

03:36.404 --> 03:38.046
Well, it's just 20 of now, so.

03:38.326 --> 03:39.067
Yeah, but we got time.

03:39.207 --> 03:41.149
So that's fine.

03:41.569 --> 03:42.430
So you're a book finder.

03:42.450 --> 03:45.933
Do you actually, in fact, do you have equipment at home that you knew where you're doing?

03:46.133 --> 03:47.815
I haven't done any finding.

03:47.835 --> 03:48.676
I haven't backed away.

03:49.636 --> 03:51.458
I have all my old hands.

03:51.438 --> 04:04.420
without getting into the fate of the business.

04:04.500 --> 04:06.985
Your father was a bookbinder.

04:07.085 --> 04:15.319
At an early age, you learned to respect and to love the book.

04:15.907 --> 04:17.750
I guess I'm just looking through, you know.

04:17.770 --> 04:34.501
Well, the reason I started book collecting is I used to go to the library conventions, and I found that most of the librarians didn't know anything about book finding or really books.

04:34.721 --> 04:36.544
As objects, you mean?

04:36.564 --> 04:36.644
Yes.

04:36.785 --> 04:40.311
I mean, it was just a little bit of a nice building, isn't it?

04:41.405 --> 04:44.631
What do you think of my tape?

04:44.711 --> 04:47.717
Village of Gates Mills, established in 1826.

04:48.077 --> 04:48.538
I had no idea.

04:48.558 --> 04:52.986
So you went to these groups and they didn't know anything about books, right?

04:53.006 --> 04:58.036
Binding and, you know, printing and paper making and so forth.

04:58.056 --> 05:01.081
And I found that none of the book finders knew anything either.

05:01.101 --> 05:03.987
Most of them couldn't find a book if their life depended on it.

05:04.007 --> 05:05.269
They were just managers.

05:08.607 --> 05:25.570
So, um, Jesse Shearer at the time, when I took over in 52, Jesse Shearer became the dean of the library school in the Western Reserve, and I said, Jess, I'm going to put something together here, and then I'll teach.

05:25.590 --> 05:32.199
Well, the Korean War, and he ended up over there, came back, and then I started to collect them.

05:32.219 --> 05:34.783
And you probably don't know this, but Dart Hunter,

05:35.135 --> 05:40.784
The great paper maker in this country is from Chillicothe, Ohio.

05:43.328 --> 05:49.156
I went down there once when I took a couple of library classes in college.

05:49.177 --> 05:57.489
I met Dart Hunter, a senior, and he was doing American paper making at the time.

05:57.509 --> 06:02.577
He had made the paper and had just printed it and they were hanging all over the place.

06:03.485 --> 06:25.813
And so, before I went into the service in 1953, I went to Kaiserslaut's bookstore and I said to Peter to buy me all the dart hunters that came into his store.

06:26.671 --> 06:36.762
When I came back out in 54, I went down to the store, and I said, Peter, I said, there's nothing at the factory from the Dart Hunters.

06:36.782 --> 06:41.908
He looked at me, and he said, I didn't think you were serious.

06:41.928 --> 06:42.368
Oh, my.

06:43.209 --> 06:49.776
And, you know, coming out of Korea, I knew more four-letter words than I did for what Peter said.

06:49.796 --> 06:53.320
I just ran him through like I would my troops, right?

06:53.536 --> 06:59.378
And he said, get out, and I told him to get off his dead ass and get me those damn books.

06:59.915 --> 07:01.577
He was a paper maker, Hunter?

07:01.738 --> 07:03.180
Dart Hunter was, yes.

07:03.480 --> 07:06.184
So how would you know what his books were?

07:06.244 --> 07:07.746
I mean, his name isn't on them.

07:07.766 --> 07:08.127
Oh, yes.

07:08.527 --> 07:08.948
Oh, yes.

07:09.188 --> 07:11.131
Oh, so it's in the watermark or something?

07:11.251 --> 07:12.052
I'll show you the books.

07:12.373 --> 07:13.034
I have them all.

07:13.154 --> 07:19.343
I'm new as the father, the grandfather, the father, and the son has been to my house now.

07:19.843 --> 07:23.389
Now, this is the center of basically Gates Mills.

07:23.649 --> 07:26.513
I'm going to take you into the downtown area.

07:27.320 --> 07:28.161
It's beautiful.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.685
Now we're crossing the Chagrin River, I would assume.

07:31.426 --> 07:41.121
Because this is where they... I live in other... They're taking a left on a route north, State Route 174.

07:41.402 --> 07:44.046
This is the river road, and you'll see...

07:51.704 --> 07:54.688
I have what's unique about design.

07:55.810 --> 08:00.717
Nobody, the mail, you have to pick it up at the post office.

08:00.737 --> 08:02.239
They don't deliver it to the house.

08:02.379 --> 08:07.607
And the reason for that is that the community wants everybody to know each other.

08:07.787 --> 08:13.175
The best way you can do that is having all the mail picked up at the post office.

08:13.195 --> 08:13.676
Nice.

08:13.696 --> 08:16.079
What would you say the population is of this village?

08:16.280 --> 08:18.403
I don't know.

08:18.603 --> 08:19.364
A couple thousand?

08:19.424 --> 08:20.245
You think it's that many?

08:20.265 --> 08:20.766
Oh, yeah.

08:22.197 --> 08:26.201
So there's no, there's no, there's no mail, I see, there are no mail, right?

08:26.321 --> 08:27.902
A couple of post office boxes.

08:27.922 --> 08:29.644
That's, no, those are for newspapers.

08:29.664 --> 08:30.205
Oh, I see.

08:31.045 --> 08:33.628
You have to go to the post office.

08:33.668 --> 08:34.208
We're going to turn around.

08:34.228 --> 08:34.429
Okay.

08:34.709 --> 08:38.452
I'll take you on the other side because they have a few homes over here.

08:39.653 --> 08:45.719
And this goes to Mayfield Road.

08:45.739 --> 08:48.041
Do these people generally work in Cleveland?

08:48.161 --> 08:50.764
This is kind of like a commuter town, right?

08:50.984 --> 08:51.284
Yes.

08:51.745 --> 08:51.985
Right.

08:54.901 --> 09:16.125
Most of these people out in this area all go into planning to work, quite a few do, but there are many offices that are moving out now as they are.

09:16.145 --> 09:18.267
Most of these, like New York City, I mean, everyone's getting up in Stamford, places of that nature.

09:18.287 --> 09:18.968
It's important getting out because

09:20.905 --> 09:22.788
The rents have gotten up.

09:22.868 --> 09:24.670
The parking is expensive.

09:25.211 --> 09:31.700
Who wants to be on the road that much?

09:31.820 --> 09:34.143
Are people able to take trains into the city?

09:34.163 --> 09:35.745
No, we don't have any trains here.

09:36.366 --> 09:37.608
No trains.

09:37.628 --> 09:39.611
That's what makes Shaker so nice.

09:39.651 --> 09:46.580
From Bob, he can drive up to the Shaker Rapid, and it'll take them right downtown Cleveland, right on Public Square.

09:47.161 --> 09:48.583
This is the Hunt Club.

09:49.610 --> 09:53.876
and community church, library.

09:53.896 --> 09:55.238
The hunt, in terms of the hunt?

09:55.759 --> 09:57.281
Yeah, they still do.

09:57.942 --> 09:59.685
They have horses.

09:59.705 --> 10:02.349
And I'll show you the field here.

10:04.512 --> 10:08.698
And they have their jumping and whatever else they do.

10:09.016 --> 10:12.661
No, there's some people out there on their horses this morning.

10:12.882 --> 10:21.374
Right, and they have other people that actually get, they truck the horses out further into the farming community where they actually still do some pops.

10:25.541 --> 10:30.989
So you basically have been involved and concerned with books all your life, I guess.

10:31.149 --> 10:32.230
Oh, yeah.

10:32.250 --> 10:36.677
Until just recently where I now have a plastics company that I

10:38.311 --> 10:45.539
What we make is the ring unit that you see in notebooks, you know, the three ring units, we make them out of plastic.

10:45.559 --> 10:51.485
We were doing well until they took the metalworks and equipment from this country and put it into China.

10:51.606 --> 10:53.748
It killed us.

10:53.768 --> 11:00.976
With the labor rates, you know, they pay them $100 a month, you know.

11:01.156 --> 11:03.118
We took it out of the chin.

11:03.178 --> 11:07.643
We lost better than 60% of our business in one month.

11:07.977 --> 11:15.691
And so now we're hanging in there and we're doing contract work and so forth.

11:15.711 --> 11:17.033
We're going to turn around here.

11:17.053 --> 11:18.837
My other brother, he has a twin.

11:18.857 --> 11:19.879
He lives in this house.

11:20.900 --> 11:23.886
He used to be with the, he lived in New Canaan.

11:24.006 --> 11:29.496
He was with IBM and worked for Tom Watson and that group with Tom's speeches.

11:30.117 --> 11:36.382
And then he went with the gardener.

11:36.542 --> 11:40.226
He became president of the gardener.

11:40.246 --> 11:45.130
That's really cool.

11:45.150 --> 11:50.595
And then he came back to Craven.

11:50.615 --> 11:52.977
He started a company and just recently sold that company.

11:52.997 --> 11:53.557
And I got him in my factory.

11:53.577 --> 11:55.218
It's a small place in the United States where we had some offices.

11:55.238 --> 11:59.382
I gave him a couple of offices up there.

12:00.323 --> 12:03.087
I pay high rent downtown to live in.

12:03.107 --> 12:03.207
Sure.

12:04.008 --> 12:05.390
It's absolutely beautiful.

12:05.410 --> 12:06.932
What kinds of trees do you think these are?

12:06.972 --> 12:07.633
These are elms.

12:07.833 --> 12:08.293
Are they elms?

12:08.374 --> 12:09.235
These are still elms.

12:09.295 --> 12:11.237
They're trying to save them.

12:11.257 --> 12:15.022
And they're working on the devil, but you can see maples planted in between them.

12:15.042 --> 12:15.323
Yeah, right.

12:15.463 --> 12:18.867
Well, there's a pretty bad lead disease for them there that can work well.

12:19.047 --> 12:20.329
We lost all of our elms.

12:20.850 --> 12:22.532
We did, too, where I live.

12:22.552 --> 12:23.393
I had elms.

12:23.934 --> 12:25.957
People like this.

12:25.977 --> 12:27.258
That's so beautiful out there.

12:27.278 --> 12:30.162
These people riding their horses, the early morning ride.

12:30.631 --> 12:36.139
And we had, you know, they had, they started an elm tree.

12:36.921 --> 12:41.748
They thought they had one that was disease resistant.

12:42.108 --> 12:51.983
And I was trying to, I was going to drive down to Kentucky where there was a nursery on these blooming things and get some.

12:52.003 --> 12:57.752
And then I read there's a red spotted fever and they're allergic to that and they were just,

12:57.968 --> 13:27.823
they just die again isn't that terrible so there's nothing and so now i've been watching chestnut too see if they come up i have a couple of chinese chestnuts but those are nothing compared to what the old american chestnut you know when in your book what you missed is jack bartfield b-a-r-t-f-i-e-l-d yeah jack bartfield he was the color place man he handled more um

13:29.238 --> 13:38.248
Audubon, than anyone ever had handled in a lifetime.

13:38.829 --> 13:39.590
Jack had them all.

13:39.990 --> 13:40.831
He was a collector?

13:41.052 --> 13:42.293
No, no, he was a dealer.

13:42.673 --> 13:44.696
Well, we'll rectify that.

13:44.816 --> 13:48.080
Jack is still, let me give you a couple of clues.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.903
He's still on West 57th Street.

13:50.923 --> 13:52.665
I think it's 100 West 57th.

13:52.685 --> 13:55.448
He used to be at 45 West 57th.

13:56.204 --> 14:01.532
And his nephew is now running Barfield Art Gallery, American Art.

14:01.552 --> 14:06.078
He was also the top man, as far as I was concerned, in American art.

14:06.278 --> 14:08.682
He had an eye that was just out of his world.

14:08.702 --> 14:09.463
He was a lawyer.

14:09.863 --> 14:12.267
He had a degree from NYU.

14:12.287 --> 14:13.429
He was a bookseller?

14:13.689 --> 14:19.377
He was a bookseller for his sets, color plate books, and American art.

14:20.234 --> 14:35.931
his uh his brother who's actually he's still living his name is is is george barkfield but he goes by the name george murray his nephew

14:41.648 --> 14:45.356
Michael Frost, his nephew, is running the American art team.

14:45.456 --> 14:48.021
And he's got an idea.

14:48.041 --> 14:50.286
I won't say American art, you mean paintings.

14:50.426 --> 14:56.859
Paintings, and bronzes, you know, Remington, Schreiber, Russell, Felser, all of that stuff.

14:56.879 --> 14:58.122
And the bronzes.

14:59.198 --> 15:02.261
Those are two that you missed.

15:02.301 --> 15:12.693
I mean, at Bartfield, because when I used to go to New York, and that's how I took my vacation with Peter, when he went to the auctions, I'd carry his bags and follow them around.

15:13.754 --> 15:24.526
And we'd always end up, started at Jack Bartfield's for lunch, went to the auction, and then we went to John's at 4 o'clock, because John served drinks at 4.

15:24.727 --> 15:26.809
And never before 4.

15:27.093 --> 15:34.081
And then we'd sit with John for a couple of hours, and then John would drive back up to Larchmont.

15:34.101 --> 15:40.249
His wife was still living, but she left the house, and she moved to a smaller house in Larchmont.

15:40.269 --> 15:46.716
And John would drive up there, and then we'd have dinner with Jack again.

15:48.398 --> 15:56.408
And I started the scene in 19—let's see, when would I start?

15:56.793 --> 15:59.338
1958 when I started to collect.

16:00.981 --> 16:07.132
So, Pete would take me to every damn bookstore, you know, that you could think of.

16:07.152 --> 16:08.895
So you started to collect in 1958.

16:08.915 --> 16:11.620
How old were you then?

16:11.920 --> 16:15.046
Uh, let's see.

16:15.206 --> 16:17.350
I was about 30 years old.

16:17.971 --> 16:21.495
Three or four years out of the Army at that point, right?

16:21.635 --> 16:21.875
Oh, yeah.

16:22.015 --> 16:22.936
I was still single.

16:22.956 --> 16:24.078
That's when I had money.

16:24.558 --> 16:29.283
I had money.

16:33.628 --> 16:35.690
I had money.

16:36.331 --> 16:44.940
Now, I enjoyed it because I never took time off from work because we were brought up to work.

16:45.578 --> 16:52.224
And the more hours I worked, I could cut the overhead.

16:52.565 --> 16:56.328
If I cut the overhead, I could make more money, which meant I could spend more money on books.

16:57.489 --> 16:59.711
Did you have a focus at the beginning?

16:59.731 --> 17:00.512
Yeah, the book finding.

17:00.592 --> 17:06.298
I had printing, paper making, book finding, examples of book finding, you know.

17:06.578 --> 17:11.923
And then I got into Western art.

17:13.203 --> 17:15.089
and exploration.

17:16.312 --> 17:23.513
It's a general library, but a very heavy accent on Dart Hunter.

17:24.396 --> 17:28.107
So he's basically the cornerstone of the- That's where I started, yes.

17:28.660 --> 17:31.324
Everything started to revolve around him.

17:31.564 --> 17:34.609
So I'll have to find some material on him to read about him.

17:34.769 --> 17:36.492
He's famous.

17:37.273 --> 17:41.019
Everyone knows Dart Hunter because he was the only man.

17:41.039 --> 17:43.442
He traveled before World War II.

17:44.584 --> 17:47.669
Traveled in all of these countries.

17:47.689 --> 17:49.451
Got examples of the paper.

17:50.012 --> 17:51.074
Wrote about the story.

17:51.154 --> 17:53.618
Came up and took photographs.

17:53.638 --> 17:55.140
Wrote about the people.

17:56.167 --> 18:05.119
and then printed the paper, designed the type, and printed it, and then he did everything but book finding.

18:05.279 --> 18:06.701
Now, what kinds of books did he do?

18:06.761 --> 18:12.789
Were they fine press books or... I'm talking in terms of content.

18:13.010 --> 18:18.277
Well, the content, you see, all this stuff was destroyed during World War II, basically.

18:18.297 --> 18:20.039
What do you mean it was destroyed?

18:20.300 --> 18:24.385
Well, I mean, all these countries that he was in,

18:24.922 --> 18:26.107
Oh, I see.

18:26.347 --> 18:31.848
That stuff was basically destroyed, forgotten.

18:31.909 --> 18:34.358
They didn't do it after World War II anymore.

18:34.658 --> 18:39.683
And they're basically Indo-China, China, Japanese.

18:39.843 --> 18:41.745
He brought all the examples here.

18:41.765 --> 18:42.866
I'm interested in this.

18:42.926 --> 18:47.831
I'm going to have a World War II and Consequences of World War II chapter in this book.

18:47.911 --> 18:51.475
This is very interesting to me.

18:51.575 --> 18:54.839
It's D-A-R-D-A-Q-N-T-E-R.

18:55.179 --> 18:56.000
That's the way it sounds.

18:56.140 --> 18:56.360
Yes.

18:57.441 --> 19:00.244
And it's the third.

19:01.017 --> 19:02.302
I'll show you all this.

19:02.322 --> 19:06.377
Now, did he write about this, about going to Europe and how all this stuff was destroyed?

19:06.478 --> 19:07.241
Oh, yeah.

19:07.441 --> 19:09.469
His son wrote a whole history of the father.

19:09.489 --> 19:11.095
The son worked with the father.

19:12.695 --> 19:17.020
So did the son write about how his father went to Europe and all these places?

19:17.040 --> 19:21.326
Yeah, the last two volumes, I'll tell you those, that the son did.

19:21.406 --> 19:26.952
And does he point out that it's good that his father did this?

19:27.173 --> 19:30.777
No, he didn't get into that.

19:32.179 --> 19:39.748
There's another gal up in Massachusetts, Brookline, that wrote a book here.

19:40.640 --> 19:47.267
She also says that, and I'll have to give you her name, up there.

19:47.828 --> 19:48.989
A Brookline woman.

19:49.009 --> 19:51.191
She has about 20 minutes from Brookline.

19:51.211 --> 20:09.010
Right, you should... Did you talk to John this morning?

20:09.479 --> 20:11.384
Yeah, look at that.

20:11.404 --> 20:13.850
I'm yakking around too much.

20:14.151 --> 20:18.221
No, but I mean, you know what I'm saying is he's... John's calm down.

20:18.381 --> 20:24.737
He... Does he have this perception of me as a... No, you see, as I tried to...

20:25.730 --> 20:41.189
I'm looking here at your shelves and I see from here to return.

20:41.209 --> 20:46.776
You want to start from the top because I've got, instead of my author,

20:47.414 --> 20:54.390
I have it by, because of my interest is of movies, you know, you'd have your, and this is not a terrific edition.

20:54.490 --> 20:57.076
So it's all about Eve?

20:57.236 --> 20:57.677
Yeah.

20:58.058 --> 20:59.100
Who's the author on that?

20:59.701 --> 21:01.586
All About Eve?

21:01.606 --> 21:02.888
I can't see it.

21:03.069 --> 21:03.851
I can't even think.

21:04.011 --> 21:04.472
I'm sorry.

21:04.612 --> 21:04.933
I'm sorry.

21:05.386 --> 21:06.828
Oh, no, forget it.

21:06.848 --> 21:08.050
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

21:08.130 --> 21:08.710
Forget it.

21:08.731 --> 21:09.371
No, I'll get it.

21:09.532 --> 21:11.254
I just thought you'd be able to know that right off the top.

21:11.334 --> 21:18.303
I know most of them, but on that one scene... I don't know what... Well, this really was an original screenplay by Joseph McElroy.

21:18.323 --> 21:18.864
Yeah, that's right.

21:18.904 --> 21:21.348
I didn't realize it was Joseph McElroy.

21:21.368 --> 21:23.891
So that's why I... Yeah, I wasn't sure.

21:23.911 --> 21:27.816
And, yeah, it's sort of acquiring the rest of Western freedom.

21:28.037 --> 21:29.138
We all know about that.

21:29.278 --> 21:30.300
By Peter Schaefer.

21:30.340 --> 21:34.245
Arsenic and old lace by...

21:35.120 --> 21:39.507
The Asphalt Jungle by W.R.

21:39.547 --> 21:39.948
Burnett.

21:41.791 --> 21:44.475
And the background dancer.

21:44.495 --> 21:45.597
I'm sorry, what?

21:45.637 --> 21:47.900
There's this background dancer.

21:47.920 --> 21:48.942
Is that a movie?

21:48.962 --> 21:49.423
Danger.

21:49.463 --> 21:50.384
No, that's Eric Gambler.

21:50.665 --> 21:51.967
Background to Danger.

21:52.007 --> 21:53.169
Oh, background.

21:53.329 --> 21:54.230
It looks like cancer.

21:54.351 --> 21:56.955
He's an English author.

21:57.135 --> 21:58.097
Eric Gambler's famous.

21:58.117 --> 22:00.300
I just couldn't.

22:00.854 --> 22:06.577
The Dialogue of Cat Ballou, which I didn't realize was a novel, by Roy Chancellor, C-H-A-N-S-L-O-R.

22:07.701 --> 22:11.978
I won't go through the whole thing, but you've got Bougest, you've got Ben Hur, The Big Sky.

22:12.380 --> 22:16.105
The Big Sleep, The Bonfire of the Vanities, which was a terrible movie.

22:16.145 --> 22:17.587
Terrible, but not a bad book.

22:17.667 --> 22:18.769
But a wonderful book.

22:18.929 --> 22:19.409
Yeah.

22:19.429 --> 22:21.412
Brideshead Revisited, wonderful.

22:21.853 --> 22:24.737
Yeah, these are offers, and all in their dust jackets.

22:24.757 --> 22:26.038
See, that's the main thing.

22:26.078 --> 22:27.380
Well, I'm just doing this.

22:27.400 --> 22:28.221
I love them.

22:28.502 --> 22:36.272
Day of the Jackal, Dr. No, which is that song, which is Ian Fleming's song, Elmer Gantry, Sinclair Lewis.

22:36.412 --> 22:38.455
These are...

22:38.654 --> 22:41.117
A very scarce book.

22:41.197 --> 22:46.143
You've got The Godfather, Goldfinger, Giant, From Here to Here.

22:46.163 --> 22:47.165
That's a nice collection.

22:47.305 --> 22:49.447
Goodbye, Mr. Chips, The Grapes of Rath.

22:50.569 --> 22:51.810
Yeah.

22:51.830 --> 22:55.114
These are both signed.

22:55.275 --> 22:56.296
Goldfinger is signed.

22:56.316 --> 22:57.137
No, which is signed?

22:57.177 --> 22:58.599
The Puzo?

22:58.919 --> 23:00.201
Gone with the Wind.

23:00.321 --> 23:01.282
Gone with the Wind?

23:01.302 --> 23:02.684
Is that the first Gone with the Wind?

23:02.744 --> 23:03.204
Oh, yeah.

23:03.224 --> 23:04.085
You want to see it?

23:04.286 --> 23:04.386
Yeah.

23:04.406 --> 23:05.047
That's pretty good.

23:05.808 --> 23:06.208
Oh, yeah.

23:06.228 --> 23:06.909
And that's signed?

23:07.530 --> 23:07.750
Oh, yeah.

23:08.810 --> 23:10.493
Wait a minute.

23:10.593 --> 23:11.154
I'll get it.

23:11.174 --> 23:16.003
I'll get it.

23:16.283 --> 23:20.931
And on your desk over here, up on the other side, you had 20th Century Fox.

23:20.951 --> 23:22.133
Yeah, that came off the building.

23:22.594 --> 23:23.115
Did it?

23:23.135 --> 23:24.297
Yeah, when they tore it down.

23:25.058 --> 23:26.741
So how did you get it?

23:26.761 --> 23:29.446
No, I found it in an antique shop down in Florida.

23:29.466 --> 23:30.067
You're kidding.

23:30.147 --> 23:30.388
No.

23:30.768 --> 23:31.369
Isn't that great?

23:31.570 --> 23:31.830
Yeah.

23:32.063 --> 23:33.886
That's one of these things that just happens.

23:33.946 --> 23:34.967
It's so wonderful, isn't it?

23:35.288 --> 23:35.408
Yeah.

23:35.628 --> 23:37.290
See, the condition here is the key.

23:37.611 --> 23:38.412
That's a lot of it.

23:38.432 --> 23:42.518
And you know that it's original when you've got this here.

23:42.998 --> 23:43.840
When you have which one?

23:44.521 --> 23:46.123
I'll show you in a minute.

23:46.143 --> 23:49.207
When you have on the back, you see the... Oh, it lists this book.

23:49.227 --> 23:51.651
Yeah, and it has to be correct that way.

23:52.492 --> 23:54.274
Now, it has to be in May after May.

23:54.615 --> 23:55.316
Yeah, it is.

23:55.336 --> 23:57.639
It's to Harry W. Drew, whatever that is.

23:57.699 --> 23:58.300
I don't know.

23:58.320 --> 24:00.383
It's an unscribed book.

24:01.426 --> 24:02.628
Congratulations.

24:05.913 --> 24:10.280
There it is, published May 1936.

24:10.360 --> 24:16.910
This is probably a case where the movie was much better than the book.

24:18.112 --> 24:19.013
Maybe you disagree.

24:19.073 --> 24:20.676
Well, I don't know.

24:23.621 --> 24:26.505
I think it was a good book.

24:27.160 --> 24:28.802
I mean, it's better than the average book.

24:28.822 --> 24:30.083
No, it's not a great book.

24:30.183 --> 24:33.166
Oh, no, no, no, nobody's ever, no, it's not a great book.

24:33.387 --> 24:37.611
But it was, I thought it was better than a Frenchie sentence woman.

24:41.075 --> 24:42.356
This is really nice.

24:42.476 --> 24:43.257
This is terrific.

24:44.078 --> 24:44.618
I love this.

24:44.658 --> 24:46.721
Goodbye, Columbus, which was a funny movie.

24:46.741 --> 24:47.341
Yeah.

24:47.481 --> 24:48.362
And that's a tough get.

24:48.382 --> 24:51.285
That's the only Philip Watt that I don't have in my own.

24:51.345 --> 24:52.547
I have a Watt collection.

24:52.567 --> 24:53.908
I like Watt.

24:53.948 --> 24:55.630
Yeah, Columbus.

24:55.650 --> 24:55.750
Yeah.

24:56.050 --> 24:57.734
Got another rock over here somewhere.

24:58.075 --> 24:59.900
But it's not in this collection.

25:01.164 --> 25:02.367
So how did this come about?

25:02.567 --> 25:11.190
Oh, when I was a boy, I mean, I was always interested in movies, and then I got polio, and then I realized I couldn't, you know, really act in it.

25:11.440 --> 25:15.425
So you dreamed of being an actor then?

25:15.525 --> 25:22.733
Oh, you see, my plan was that I was going to play second base for the New York Yankees in the summertime.

25:22.753 --> 25:25.176
And then in the off-season, I was going to be a movie star.

25:25.196 --> 25:26.077
Oh, good for you, yeah.

25:26.177 --> 25:27.919
See, we had Paul Newman here in town.

25:27.939 --> 25:29.281
He was a good friend of mine.

25:29.301 --> 25:29.961
Is that right?

25:29.982 --> 25:30.322
Yeah.

25:30.822 --> 25:31.864
He's from this area.

25:31.984 --> 25:32.725
I didn't know that.

25:32.885 --> 25:33.225
Yeah.

25:33.425 --> 25:33.806
Oh, yeah.

25:35.047 --> 25:37.330
And he went to Kenya and then gave him respect for that.

25:38.052 --> 25:40.675
He's kind of more of a neighbor of mine than he is of yours.

25:40.755 --> 25:42.436
Now, what, you have in Connecticut?

25:42.456 --> 25:45.359
No, I live in Central Mass, but everyone was like 20 minutes from Connecticut.

25:45.379 --> 25:46.640
Yeah, well, that's where he lives.

25:46.661 --> 25:49.443
He's on a Westport, I think.

25:49.463 --> 25:51.205
Yeah.

25:51.225 --> 25:53.507
And then, The Lost Weekend by Charles Jackson.

25:53.527 --> 25:55.890
And The Last Picture Show by Larry McBride.

25:56.010 --> 25:58.272
See, some of the really tough books to get.

25:58.292 --> 25:59.113
Oh, yeah.

25:59.213 --> 26:00.294
That's very interesting.

26:00.334 --> 26:01.996
Former by Liam L.I.A.M.

26:02.276 --> 26:03.337
O'Flaherty.

26:03.357 --> 26:03.918
Yeah.

26:03.938 --> 26:06.120
And Cold Blood by Truman Capote.

26:06.220 --> 26:07.401
Peter Leslie Jaws.

26:08.528 --> 26:13.213
The Man Who Came to Dinner, by Kaufman and Hart.

26:14.235 --> 26:16.918
I think they rated Minsky's, Warren Barber.

26:16.958 --> 26:19.721
Do you have booksellers looking for these groups?

26:19.741 --> 26:21.623
This is a tough one.

26:22.564 --> 26:23.405
I've got all of his.

26:23.505 --> 26:26.929
Mutiny on the Bounty is a tough one.

26:27.370 --> 26:35.599
I've got most of the Super A's over with all of his stuff.

26:36.254 --> 26:42.484
I'm just doing this for the sake of buy-in.

26:42.504 --> 26:44.948
Well, Africa's fairly recent film.

26:44.969 --> 26:47.092
Yeah, no, that's not an English edition.

26:47.112 --> 26:50.037
Well, yeah, this one is English, I think.

26:50.057 --> 26:53.042
And, of course, she was a Gange.

26:53.963 --> 26:57.109
I think this Huffington, which I reviewed when it came out.

26:57.149 --> 26:58.872
That sign, which I'll describe.

26:59.252 --> 27:00.895
This sign, I'll describe.

27:02.039 --> 27:07.765
It was kind of a, I think that was a Dom de Guerre, that name that he used.

27:07.785 --> 27:08.266
Yeah, it was.

27:08.967 --> 27:11.870
Kenneth Robbins, Northwest Passage.

27:11.950 --> 27:13.772
Actually, so how many do you figure you have?

27:14.793 --> 27:16.055
Oh, I don't know.

27:16.335 --> 27:19.278
A hundred and twenty or so.

27:19.459 --> 27:21.080
Oh, there's more than that.

27:21.421 --> 27:25.946
This is one of the better looking ones, you know, for aesthetics.

27:25.966 --> 27:26.967
This, when I bought it,

27:27.537 --> 27:30.821
I hadn't had it in an hour, and the dealer called me back.

27:30.841 --> 27:37.288
My competition is out in California, with the directors and the actors, and they don't want these.

27:37.308 --> 27:43.716
And to find this one... We're talking about the Philadelphia story by Philip Berry.

27:43.896 --> 27:46.579
Yeah, right.

27:46.940 --> 27:47.561
So what happened?

27:47.581 --> 27:50.524
He called... Well, I wasn't going to give it up.

27:50.774 --> 27:53.397
You know, he said he would double, you know, whatever.

27:53.497 --> 27:54.739
This is a nice collection.

27:54.839 --> 27:57.683
Smiley's People, Sophie's Choice, Serpico.

27:58.284 --> 28:00.046
Yeah.

28:00.987 --> 28:06.073
We have The Sin Man by Dashiell Hammett.

28:06.174 --> 28:12.582
Here's one of the ones that the author of this book, Shane, is a member of Wolfheim.

28:12.802 --> 28:15.766
And so he came to Cleveland.

28:15.886 --> 28:18.589
The author, Jack Schaefer, C-H-H-E.

28:18.649 --> 28:19.711
Yeah, yeah, Schaefer.

28:19.731 --> 28:19.971
Those are

28:20.879 --> 28:22.921
It's a pretty good movie.

28:23.201 --> 28:25.263
But here, he signed it.

28:25.283 --> 28:27.125
Oh, you want to go over there?

28:27.145 --> 28:28.086
No, no, I'm just listening.

28:28.166 --> 28:30.048
It said Jack Haynes.

28:30.168 --> 28:32.931
Oh, that's inscribed with Jack Palance.

28:33.111 --> 28:35.994
It's a great jacket.

28:36.014 --> 28:40.418
I was just looking at Gravity's Red Bull, which is one of the great novels of my time.

28:40.438 --> 28:42.661
It's a very, very hard book to get into.

28:42.701 --> 28:43.401
In that condition?

28:43.622 --> 28:44.382
Yeah.

28:44.603 --> 28:45.764
Exceedingly.

28:46.044 --> 28:47.005
I'll say it is.

28:47.761 --> 28:52.031
And this Catcher in the Life, that wasn't a movie, was it?

28:52.171 --> 28:52.912
No, no.

28:52.933 --> 28:56.701
See, these books over here are books that are not in my collection.

28:56.721 --> 29:00.008
I mean, they're not part of the collection of movies.

29:00.028 --> 29:04.518
These are books that I bought for my own, you know, location.

29:04.558 --> 29:04.819
Okay.

29:04.879 --> 29:05.280
Yeah.

29:05.682 --> 29:08.706
So again, you wanted to be a, I had to work with all that.

29:08.866 --> 29:10.949
That's just, I'm making, you know, kind of fun.

29:10.969 --> 29:14.854
I mean, everybody, when you're a boy, you know, you all have your dreams.

29:14.894 --> 29:17.758
And I did play third base when I was in high school.

29:18.299 --> 29:21.042
So all that stuff was blown apart.

29:21.142 --> 29:22.584
So what did the collection start with?

29:23.105 --> 29:24.387
What was the first movie book?

29:25.188 --> 29:31.416
Well, actually, the first book I ever really bought was this book, right up here.

29:32.778 --> 29:35.301
And it was Nicholas Nickleby.

29:36.192 --> 29:40.137
And, uh, Dickens, is that a first, Dickens?

29:40.158 --> 29:40.738
Yeah.

29:41.039 --> 29:41.900
Nicholas Nickleby.

29:42.541 --> 29:49.390
Yeah, and that was a book that, uh... That's not Sideway Dickens, is it?

29:49.811 --> 29:53.196
I can't, I don't, I can't... I know, I know, I know, I know more of it.

29:53.216 --> 29:55.198
But I only paid, I think, $80 for it.

29:55.238 --> 29:58.463
But it took me, it took me two and a half years.

29:58.523 --> 30:01.267
I had to pay this paper route, the largest paper route in Cleveland.

30:01.728 --> 30:03.350
It took me two and a half years to pay for it.

30:03.570 --> 30:05.312
Wait a minute, you were a boy when you bought this?

30:05.333 --> 30:05.693
Yeah.

30:05.858 --> 30:06.299
How old?

30:06.980 --> 30:09.024
Oh, I was just before I pointed at 15.

30:09.044 --> 30:11.969
This has been $80 for a book when you were 15.

30:11.989 --> 30:14.354
Yeah, I've been talking since I was 15.

30:14.995 --> 30:15.556
I'm impressed.

30:16.417 --> 30:18.060
Why, you shouldn't be all that.

30:18.080 --> 30:20.004
Well, no, I think for a 15-year-old kid.

30:20.024 --> 30:28.339
Oh, yeah, well, what happened was, it's kind of interesting, because what I did was I went downtown to, as a matter of fact, Newman Stearns.

30:28.876 --> 30:34.162
Paul Newman's, his parents had a store here, it was a sports store, and I went down to get a third baseman's glove.

30:34.503 --> 30:37.707
Why don't you sit down?

30:37.727 --> 30:41.251
Yeah, sit down.

30:41.812 --> 30:55.028
And so, then, yeah, and so what it amounted to was that they didn't have the kind of glove that I needed, so they said, go on over to Halley Brothers, which was a department store, and they've got a great sports department over there.

30:55.528 --> 30:58.512
So I went over there and got off on the wrong floor, and there was a

30:58.930 --> 31:27.942
gorgeous book department up there, and it took up the whole floor, which was much larger than, you know, and with all of these wonderful bindings and books and everything, and in those days, of course, Hemingway was young, and so, you know, we had F. Scott Fitzgerald and Eugene O'Neill, and I was looking at all these, and I knew some of these authors, because I used to read a lot, and so I reached up for this book up here,

31:28.141 --> 31:31.725
And I heard this voice behind me that said, don't.

31:33.688 --> 31:43.019
I went back, you know, because she didn't, she wanted to get the book out properly, instead of the way a youngster would reach out to get it.

31:43.840 --> 31:54.232
So I, instead of getting the bat, the glove, because I only had, I think, I think I had about $12 on me, it was all.

31:55.494 --> 31:57.256
And that was a lot of money, $12 was a lot of money.

31:57.276 --> 31:58.097
And what was that out here?

31:58.634 --> 31:59.255
What?

31:59.275 --> 32:00.216
Where was that?

32:00.236 --> 32:01.677
Downtown Cleveland.

32:01.697 --> 32:03.860
Downtown Cleveland.

32:03.880 --> 32:03.980
Yeah.

32:04.480 --> 32:05.421
What was the name of the store?

32:05.441 --> 32:07.183
Do you remember about that?

32:07.203 --> 32:08.465
Do you remember the name of the store?

32:08.805 --> 32:09.606
Oh, Halley Brothers.

32:09.806 --> 32:10.306
Halley Brothers.

32:10.327 --> 32:12.048
Oh, that was a well-known name in Cleveland.

32:12.088 --> 32:12.909
H-A-L-L-E-Y?

32:13.270 --> 32:15.392
H-A-L-L-E apostrophe, yes.

32:15.432 --> 32:16.033
It was Halley's.

32:16.473 --> 32:23.701
It was the name of the owner, or the person who started the store, was Walter Halley.

32:24.382 --> 32:24.522
Mm-hmm.

32:24.542 --> 32:25.523
Yeah, he was a wonderful man.

32:25.823 --> 32:26.504
H-A-L-L-E.

32:26.684 --> 32:27.645
Yeah, yeah.

32:28.638 --> 32:34.986
And so, as a matter of fact, he went to Princeton with my cousin, Ted Linehan.

32:35.086 --> 32:36.068
But that's another story.

32:36.689 --> 32:42.016
So, I mean, I said I had to have that book.

32:42.056 --> 32:47.443
And so she said, you know, you can put some money down on it, and I'll hold it for you.

32:47.683 --> 32:50.146
And so finally I got it.

32:50.186 --> 32:51.568
And I got some others up there.

32:52.269 --> 32:55.553
So I started collecting when I was fairly young.

32:55.573 --> 32:56.755
Did you know you were a collector?

32:56.971 --> 32:58.233
Was this collecting for you?

32:58.514 --> 33:01.680
No, I just had this kind of a lust.

33:02.581 --> 33:08.452
I mean, it started, the germ or the genesis of it started right then at that instant.

33:08.472 --> 33:08.733
Really?

33:09.153 --> 33:11.297
As a matter of fact, there was... Why did it have to be Dickens?

33:11.397 --> 33:12.239
Why was it there?

33:12.259 --> 33:17.609
What was so... Well, I had... Because I had read the book, you see.

33:18.350 --> 33:21.055
I had read the book, but I'd never seen a volume like that.

33:22.486 --> 33:24.609
See, we had required reading.

33:24.629 --> 33:34.905
When I went to high school, we had a very demanding English department, and we had to read, you know, I don't know how many books every summer, and even in junior high.

33:36.067 --> 33:41.575
So we had to read, you know, we had to read Dickens and that sort of thing, you know.

33:41.595 --> 33:46.823
So, I don't know, I don't think that's true today in high school, but, or junior high.

33:47.925 --> 33:48.225
Pardon me?

33:48.346 --> 33:50.068
Unfortunately, it's not true today.

33:50.229 --> 33:51.210
No, no.

33:52.000 --> 33:58.488
But my mother was, I mean, she had a lot of books, and so I was always being, you know.

33:59.309 --> 34:08.982
And so, like, so... No, I, that's, so that's basically, so that, and then, of course, when I had poetry and everything like that, I had a lot of time to read.

34:09.082 --> 34:09.903
How old were you?

34:09.923 --> 34:11.946
15, I just went on 16.

34:12.586 --> 34:12.927
Yeah.

34:12.947 --> 34:15.670
So this is when I was... Well, that had been 1941.

34:15.690 --> 34:17.152
40, so 41.

34:17.372 --> 34:18.975
Yeah.

34:19.095 --> 34:19.375
So...

34:20.215 --> 34:22.358
But, actually, I lucked up.

34:22.378 --> 34:23.380
That's another story.

34:23.861 --> 34:25.944
You worked pretty well with it.

34:25.964 --> 34:27.547
Yeah, I came out of it fairly well.

34:28.588 --> 34:29.410
A lot of hard work.

34:29.430 --> 34:31.393
The baseball career was over.

34:31.413 --> 34:32.094
That was over.

34:33.216 --> 34:44.434
The only thing I remember about that, I can remember that to throw a ball from third base to first base, which is the hypotenuse of a square of 90 feet, is 127 feet 3 3 8 inches.

34:44.887 --> 34:49.234
You know, and you had to be good to be able to throw a ball that far.

34:49.434 --> 34:51.237
Yeah, yeah.

34:51.257 --> 34:52.579
So then I have other books.

34:52.639 --> 34:55.584
I have a lot of books upstairs, too, and I need some books over here.

34:55.884 --> 35:00.552
So there must be, with movies, I mean, you don't have Jurassic Park, for instance.

35:00.572 --> 35:05.139
Well, that's the sort of thing that Creighton wrote that, didn't he?

35:05.159 --> 35:05.479
Creighton.

35:05.499 --> 35:07.563
Yeah, Creighton, yeah.

35:07.843 --> 35:09.105
I'm not, that's...

35:09.760 --> 35:11.363
I mean, I'm getting old, I guess.

35:11.584 --> 35:16.473
I mean, it's not, although I probably should get it because that's the sort of thing.

35:16.494 --> 35:18.678
Well, it's the biggest grossing movie of all time.

35:18.698 --> 35:19.379
I don't care.

35:19.540 --> 35:23.748
It's whether or not I consider it a good movie.

35:23.768 --> 35:24.991
So, you go to the movies a lot?

35:25.792 --> 35:28.337
I used to go a lot, but I don't anymore.

35:28.377 --> 35:30.722
TV, of course, and because...

35:31.057 --> 35:33.399
It's getting a little more difficult for me to get around.

35:33.419 --> 35:36.703
So you get the cable now, number one, and you can get the tapes.

35:36.823 --> 35:40.106
Yeah, and I have, no, I have LaserDisc.

35:41.087 --> 35:41.808
That's what I have.

35:41.928 --> 35:44.471
I have some of my favorite movies over here.

35:45.412 --> 35:46.353
LaserDisc.

35:46.573 --> 35:51.819
Yeah, the difference between LaserDisc and tape is just absolutely, you know.

35:51.839 --> 35:52.299
No kidding.

35:52.439 --> 35:53.040
Yeah.

35:53.060 --> 35:57.925
So can you name some of them for me, movies that you have on LaserDisc?

35:58.310 --> 35:59.732
And all these are this.

35:59.792 --> 36:02.476
Can you just name a few for me?

36:02.496 --> 36:07.243
Well, let's just say, how about Das Boot, which I consider one of the finest.

36:07.263 --> 36:08.345
It was a German.

36:08.926 --> 36:10.148
Do you have that book?

36:10.208 --> 36:10.308
What?

36:10.909 --> 36:11.350
Do you have that book?

36:11.370 --> 36:11.510
No.

36:11.530 --> 36:16.017
Well, I happened upon that book when I was up in Martha's Vineyard.

36:16.037 --> 36:19.562
I have a relative up there who was- Was that just published about 15 to 20 years ago?

36:20.283 --> 36:22.566
No, a little bit more than that, I think.

36:22.586 --> 36:22.967
Yeah, that

36:23.251 --> 36:27.958
That book came out, that was about the Second World War, and it was about a German submarine.

36:27.978 --> 36:31.424
Yeah, I know, but it seems to me I reviewed that book.

36:31.444 --> 36:36.752
Well, maybe you did, but I mean, the first time Barbara and I were up there, and I saw the book, and I pulled it out.

36:36.832 --> 36:38.815
Of course, it was an English edition, not a German.

36:40.057 --> 36:45.606
And so, I don't know that I'm answering your question.

36:45.646 --> 36:46.928
I don't know.

36:46.968 --> 36:50.153
See, I don't have the book, you know.

36:50.909 --> 36:55.395
If I got it, see, it would be like getting, say, for instance, out of Africa.

36:55.575 --> 36:56.276
I have that movie.

36:56.296 --> 36:57.778
To have and to have not.

36:57.798 --> 37:04.006
But out of Africa, for instance, you know, I have it in English, but I'd love to have it in Danish.

37:05.208 --> 37:07.671
You know, that would be a sign.

37:07.691 --> 37:10.094
That's the true collector, because the movie is in English.

37:11.135 --> 37:11.476
I know.

37:12.017 --> 37:16.242
I know the movie is in English, but the integrity of the book is such that

37:16.475 --> 37:19.538
It's very important to me, and I'd love to have that in Danish sign language.

37:19.558 --> 37:21.521
Of course, you can't read Danish, so it's not a book.

37:21.541 --> 37:22.061
I don't care.

37:22.121 --> 37:26.126
I mean, that, you see, again, you come down to the book.

37:26.486 --> 37:27.227
It's the artifacts.

37:27.247 --> 37:27.807
Yeah.

37:27.827 --> 37:33.714
I'll give you a good illustration of that, the best I can, is The Treasure of Sierra Madre.

37:33.734 --> 37:35.736
It was written by a gentleman named Traven.

37:36.677 --> 37:40.722
And he kind of disappeared, but the black book really was written in German first.

37:41.322 --> 37:42.283
I didn't know that.

37:42.764 --> 37:42.904
Uh-huh.

37:43.087 --> 37:44.689
And I have that.

37:44.729 --> 37:48.153
That's a very, very difficult book to find in English.

37:49.114 --> 37:51.958
It's got a wonderful jacket.

37:52.719 --> 37:56.824
So that I have, you know, I have that.

37:56.864 --> 37:58.405
To have, to have not.

37:58.446 --> 38:04.313
Most of, you know, Hemingway's stuff that was made in the movies, and particularly with Bogart.

38:05.814 --> 38:07.997
So when did you actually start getting the movies?

38:08.956 --> 38:09.657
Later.

38:09.898 --> 38:10.238
Later.

38:10.399 --> 38:10.860
Later.

38:10.900 --> 38:19.356
Because, see, what I had to do is I had to slug my way out of polio, and my preoccupation then went away from books and had, how was I going to go to school?

38:21.380 --> 38:25.989
And I couldn't, you know, I wasn't in the war, obviously, and I didn't have the GI Bill.

38:26.129 --> 38:29.175
My father had died when I was ten.

38:29.830 --> 38:35.257
and my, his estate didn't settle until I was 40 years old, so I was... 40 years old?

38:35.277 --> 38:37.600
Yeah, so... 30 years to settle down?

38:37.700 --> 38:39.603
Yeah, yeah, that's another story.

38:39.843 --> 38:42.106
I don't even want to talk about that, it was all legal.

38:43.247 --> 38:58.707
But, um, so then, uh, you know, my struggle was, I mean, I got, I went to Ohio U, and, uh, that's because it wasn't so far, and it was a, I mean, physically it was terribly to me, and I didn't care for the school, so I

38:59.227 --> 39:27.360
I was able to transfer into the University of Michigan, and then I was only able to do that in the summer times because what it amounted to was the physical demands of going from building to building, and versus, say, high school, which I did quite well in after polio, because that's one building, and you had youngsters helping you carry your books, and I got along well with everybody, so...

39:28.252 --> 39:34.700
But in college, it's a lot less, you know, distant, remote, and... And what were you studying?

39:35.581 --> 39:36.723
What were you planning?

39:37.964 --> 39:38.125
Finance.

39:38.145 --> 39:38.285
Uh-huh.

39:38.305 --> 39:38.405
Yeah.

39:38.425 --> 39:45.875
I wanted, you know, American decorative arts, and I finally did some graduate work at Yale on that, but I never got a degree from college.

39:46.495 --> 39:55.867
I got, was able to get into Yale through Charles Montgomery up there, and he said, I don't care about, they said, your grades are good, you come on in.

39:56.909 --> 39:57.229
So...

39:58.492 --> 39:59.934
So I was able to do that.

40:00.716 --> 40:02.859
So I don't have my degree, but I can't help that.

40:02.919 --> 40:04.161
That's just one of those things.

40:07.166 --> 40:09.991
But getting back, did I answer your question?

40:10.011 --> 40:11.413
I don't know that I did, didn't I?

40:11.433 --> 40:12.094
I'm rambling.

40:12.495 --> 40:13.516
That's fine.

40:13.577 --> 40:18.605
I'm a rambler myself, so I like your discressive responses.

40:19.666 --> 40:22.691
I guess I'm still interested in when you started.

40:22.711 --> 40:24.214
Oh, then I started part.

40:24.294 --> 40:25.596
That really was your question.

40:25.964 --> 40:33.091
Then, from time to time, I would see a book in a store that related to a movie.

40:33.111 --> 40:37.375
And if I saw it, then the integrity of the book was such a condition, I should say.

40:37.395 --> 40:40.037
I was always interested in condition.

40:41.779 --> 40:43.300
And if I could get it signed.

40:44.742 --> 40:47.444
So, uh, of course, you can't always get it signed.

40:47.484 --> 40:47.544
No.

40:48.325 --> 40:53.810
But I'm, I don't, many of my books, most, I wouldn't say most, but I would say 50% of my books are signed.

40:55.191 --> 40:55.752
And, uh,

40:56.255 --> 41:06.184
I mean, as a matter of fact, I was looking at a book today, Eric Gambler, The Mask of Demetrius, that Jim Peppers got out in California.

41:06.204 --> 41:08.967
He also has another copy of Jaws out there.

41:08.987 --> 41:13.831
Now, I've got a copy of Jaws here, but it's not signed by Peter Benchley.

41:14.752 --> 41:18.395
And his is signed, but my jacket is better than his.

41:18.535 --> 41:21.478
So I'm thinking of... Before we get Benchley to sign that for you.

41:23.020 --> 41:24.441
No, he doesn't do that, I don't think.

41:24.501 --> 41:25.722
I've had people ask that.

41:25.887 --> 41:28.670
Do you know him?

41:29.070 --> 41:30.511
I've been to him a couple of times.

41:30.672 --> 41:31.953
I do a book call.

41:33.134 --> 41:35.356
I mean, I had his phone number in Princeton.

41:35.376 --> 41:36.938
It was not a place in New Jersey, I think.

41:37.178 --> 41:41.302
Well, hell, if I could do that, then I've already... That's what I do.

41:41.362 --> 41:43.344
I get my books signed directly by the office.

41:43.464 --> 41:44.665
Well, but you're well known.

41:44.945 --> 41:46.907
I mean, they don't know me.

41:46.987 --> 41:47.908
Everybody knows me.

41:47.948 --> 41:48.849
Everybody knows me.

41:48.869 --> 41:49.690
Yeah, right.

41:50.070 --> 41:50.150
Huh?

41:50.210 --> 41:50.551
Yeah.

41:51.171 --> 41:52.873
So, um...

41:53.427 --> 41:55.891
So then I'd pick them up one at a time.

41:55.911 --> 41:58.194
I'll bring in the other chair.

41:58.275 --> 41:58.936
Let me get another chair.

41:58.956 --> 42:00.298
So I'd add to them.

42:00.318 --> 42:00.859
It's right by the chair.

42:00.879 --> 42:02.261
I'd add to them as I went along.

42:02.842 --> 42:13.478
And then when I became a member of RoFON, I think the pace probably accelerated because I wanted to impress people like Hugo Albers and this.

42:14.707 --> 42:33.274
But you know, Barbara and I used to go out, there was a dealer out in San Francisco by the name of Ward Howell.

42:33.875 --> 42:34.736
John.

42:34.816 --> 42:36.479
I mean John Howell.

42:37.180 --> 42:39.143
Why do I want to say Ward?

42:39.183 --> 42:40.364
Well, his son was Warren.

42:40.485 --> 42:43.068
But Ward Howell was our painter.

42:43.269 --> 42:44.190
Yeah, right, all right.

42:44.558 --> 42:46.341
So John, John Howell's.

42:46.361 --> 42:48.924
But Warren Howell owned John Howell books.

42:48.964 --> 42:49.185
Right.

42:49.205 --> 42:50.567
He was always known as John Howell.

42:50.587 --> 42:51.207
He was a big guy.

42:51.308 --> 42:51.708
Yeah.

42:51.949 --> 42:52.990
And I'll say he was.

42:53.010 --> 42:55.834
He used to sit at a desk, a huge desk like this.

42:56.094 --> 42:59.860
And so he had some vellum-covered rackums.

42:59.980 --> 43:00.921
I have them up there.

43:02.003 --> 43:04.827
And so I bought those from him.

43:04.847 --> 43:08.933
And then one time we bought a painting.

43:08.953 --> 43:10.515
It was a watercolor of...

43:12.520 --> 43:14.583
Oh, boy, a Bucking Bronco.

43:14.603 --> 43:15.204
A Bucking Bronco.

43:15.224 --> 43:16.786
But who was the painter?

43:17.347 --> 43:17.467
Boron.

43:17.787 --> 43:19.690
Boron, Edward Boron.

43:19.710 --> 43:19.930
Boron.

43:20.311 --> 43:23.875
And we'd had it, yeah, we'd had it for about, I don't think.

43:23.896 --> 43:24.797
We loved it, too.

43:24.857 --> 43:25.798
We loved it.

43:26.078 --> 43:31.105
We had it for about four or five years, and I was really, I also had a Frank Tanny Johnson.

43:31.766 --> 43:39.216
And so I get this call from Howell, and he said, Bill, he said, I have a problem.

43:39.236 --> 43:40.418
And I said, well, what's your problem?

43:41.630 --> 43:44.274
He said, well, the boring isn't right.

43:44.294 --> 43:46.877
I said, what do you mean it's not right?

43:46.997 --> 43:55.128
He said, well, he said, I think I bought this under conditions that maybe I shouldn't have, and I wasn't.

43:55.148 --> 43:58.253
So he asked if I would return it.

43:58.273 --> 44:00.916
Of course, obviously, he'd give me the money back, placentas, and all that.

44:01.517 --> 44:07.846
Well, you know, I tell you, I like the painting so much that even though it wasn't right, I should have kept the damn thing.

44:07.866 --> 44:09.288
I mean, I really liked it that much.

44:09.508 --> 44:09.628
Right.

44:10.098 --> 44:13.461
I'm going to grab one of these.

44:13.481 --> 44:15.283
But he was a good book dealer.

44:15.963 --> 44:17.625
Yes, and I messed up.

44:18.806 --> 44:27.374
I used to meet him at Barfeel's, and when they had the auctions up in New York.

44:27.614 --> 44:28.555
Yeah, yeah.

44:28.956 --> 44:33.640
I didn't know what he was like to other people, but I really liked him.

44:33.980 --> 44:35.282
I just thought he was a neat guy.

44:35.362 --> 44:36.983
Take us out to lunch, you know.

44:37.063 --> 44:39.025
I never met him, but I mean, he died.

44:40.523 --> 44:42.325
just before I started work on my last book.

44:42.405 --> 44:45.669
Yeah, I don't know whether I want this on tape or not, but I want to ask you a question.

44:45.689 --> 44:46.010
Can you?

44:46.450 --> 44:47.952
How do you turn it off?

44:48.393 --> 44:50.916
The switch is right there next to the light.

44:51.196 --> 44:51.997
Just put it in the middle.

44:53.519 --> 44:54.781
I'll get it.

44:54.901 --> 45:00.187
I'll take it over to him.

45:00.267 --> 45:02.450
If you hear a beep, just tell me.

45:02.470 --> 45:06.495
Well, that means that I've used a swear word or something.

45:06.515 --> 45:08.357
No, no, no.

45:08.377 --> 45:09.619
Well, so, you see...

45:10.190 --> 45:10.991
What comes first?

45:11.011 --> 45:17.880
Do you see a book that you appreciate and then it becomes a movie, or do you see a movie that you like and then you want to get the book?

45:17.900 --> 45:18.901
No, that's a good question.

45:19.082 --> 45:29.115
I think probably what the book has to do is to ring my bell, and it probably doesn't ring my bell unless it was a movie that, I mean, I really liked.

45:29.575 --> 45:35.423
Now, to give you an illustration, most men wouldn't go for a book, like, say, called Now Voyager.

45:36.624 --> 45:37.486
I enjoyed that movie.

45:37.506 --> 45:38.627
That's an old movie.

45:39.147 --> 45:39.708
I enjoyed it.

45:39.748 --> 45:43.272
I saw the book, and it probably doesn't have it.

45:43.292 --> 45:45.815
I guess I've got it around there somewhere.

45:46.255 --> 45:59.051
So the book, I mean, the movie and the book are intertwined, and I had to have a real, say, love affair with the movie.

45:59.071 --> 46:00.092
The movie and the fourth book.

46:01.034 --> 46:20.284
I suppose, but now that wouldn't be true here, for instance, like, Gravity's Rainbow, I mean, that's a book that I've been looking for for a long time, and I got it about three years ago, and also Seven Gothic Tales, I mean, look at the condition, you know, and I don't know whether you're familiar with Henry James, I mean, H.R.

46:20.304 --> 46:21.586
James, not Henry James, but H.R.

46:21.626 --> 46:23.249
James, The Five Jars.

46:25.212 --> 46:27.936
Yeah, look at the condition on that one, you know, that's...

46:28.591 --> 46:31.274
So in Bombers, it was a good book.

46:31.294 --> 46:33.636
That's not a valuable book, but it's a good book.

46:33.656 --> 46:38.901
I think with a focus like this, you must have a pretty definite want list.

46:38.921 --> 46:40.703
There must be books that you like to have.

46:40.723 --> 46:47.109
Well, you know, think about, it depends upon whether you really have an interest in movies.

46:47.570 --> 46:54.717
And when I think of movies, I mean, I think of movies that rang my bell when I was a youngster, like Gunga Deen.

46:55.557 --> 46:56.918
Well, Gundudin was a ballad.

46:56.938 --> 46:59.521
I mean, it was a poem by Kipling.

46:59.541 --> 47:08.809
And so I finally had to get barrack room ballads, you know, which is a great... It's a great... And other ditties, isn't that the subject?

47:08.910 --> 47:12.253
Barrack room ballads and other ditties.

47:12.753 --> 47:18.238
I don't know that it says that, but... Let's see here.

47:18.539 --> 47:21.962
I've got to open this up in a while here.

47:22.322 --> 47:23.303
It opens up a different way.

47:26.388 --> 47:32.799
In this edition, dust paper, 225 company premise, 200 for sale, and other verses.

47:33.199 --> 47:34.141
Other verses.

47:34.381 --> 47:34.702
Close.

47:35.924 --> 47:37.446
Why did I think ditties?

47:37.466 --> 47:37.827
I don't know why.

47:37.847 --> 47:38.688
Well, you know.

47:39.209 --> 47:41.914
Sound English, you know.

47:42.334 --> 47:44.458
I mean, I can recite the last verse.

47:44.538 --> 47:45.700
I'll see you later on.

47:46.000 --> 47:47.883
He has a title with ditties in it.

47:47.964 --> 47:48.665
Probably does.

47:48.745 --> 47:49.045
Yeah.

47:49.446 --> 47:50.067
Probably does.

47:51.042 --> 47:55.709
So we'll see him later on at the place where he has gone, where it's always double drill and no canteen.

47:56.069 --> 47:56.349
That's right.

47:56.369 --> 48:00.856
Well, you know, there's a book out, a movie out, which my kids love.

48:01.457 --> 48:04.821
It's called Jumanji, you know, with Robin Williams.

48:05.021 --> 48:08.867
And that's based on a children's book by Chris Van Ellsberg.

48:08.887 --> 48:10.970
It's a little 32-page illustrated children's book.

48:11.751 --> 48:15.897
And that, I just didn't interview with Chris Van Ellsberg for a book haul a couple weeks ago.

48:15.917 --> 48:16.898
It was out of progress.

48:17.975 --> 48:24.603
I said, well, tell me, how does a 32-page children's book become a film?

48:24.763 --> 48:25.264
Yeah.

48:25.304 --> 48:25.905
Pretty interesting.

48:26.626 --> 48:27.547
Pretty interesting kind of thing.

48:27.567 --> 48:29.830
Because there's a lot of things like that, I guess.

48:31.431 --> 48:37.799
Well, it's just, for instance, anything with Sidney Greenstreet in it, any movie with it.

48:37.879 --> 48:40.843
I mean, I just, you know, I had to have that book.

48:41.414 --> 48:42.816
How about Casablanca?

48:42.836 --> 48:46.621
Well, that really wasn't, that was really written by two people.

48:46.641 --> 48:47.802
That was an original screenplay.

48:47.842 --> 48:48.744
The screenplay, yeah.

48:49.344 --> 48:53.049
So, I mean, I have something to relate to it, but it's not a book.

48:54.531 --> 49:00.179
It's probably the most interesting screenplay that was ever written, so far as fun reading.

49:00.439 --> 49:02.241
Probably one of the most interesting movies ever been produced.

49:02.261 --> 49:03.082
I'll say.

49:03.123 --> 49:06.527
Yeah, and of course I have that on, you know.

49:07.216 --> 49:12.223
So there were a lot of movies that were really nothing but screenplays, but that were screenplays.

49:12.403 --> 49:14.907
That were original screenplays.

49:14.927 --> 49:16.329
And that were wonderful movies.

49:17.350 --> 49:20.875
But, you know, I mean, you can take Hemingway.

49:21.335 --> 49:25.181
I mean, practically anything that he wrote that was in the movie, it was a good movie.

49:27.063 --> 49:29.447
I can't think of anything that was a bomb in you.

49:29.687 --> 49:31.690
No, no.

49:31.710 --> 49:34.073
What was the last one, The Sea Around Us or something like that?

49:34.954 --> 49:35.515
I think so.

49:36.416 --> 49:37.037
I have that.

49:37.422 --> 49:42.931
Other short stories that became... I can't pick any.

49:43.272 --> 49:45.616
Really?

49:46.678 --> 49:52.087
But, you know, so you can take... There were certain authors that... Goodbye Columbus is a short story.

49:53.229 --> 49:53.690
Yeah.

49:53.710 --> 49:55.333
It was a great movie.

49:56.454 --> 49:58.678
It's a funny story out of that book.

49:58.919 --> 50:00.541
Yeah.

50:00.561 --> 50:00.882
Yeah.

50:01.081 --> 50:01.562
Yeah.

50:01.582 --> 50:03.966
I wonder if I ever did Stephen Crane's The Open Boat.

50:04.026 --> 50:05.828
Did he ever make a movie out of that?

50:05.848 --> 50:07.651
No, that's a red book.

50:07.671 --> 50:08.993
Does that make a good play, maybe?

50:09.394 --> 50:10.856
Yeah.

50:10.876 --> 50:11.738
How about theater?

50:11.838 --> 50:14.081
Are you limited to the theater?

50:14.101 --> 50:22.755
Well, I mean, I have those books that were originally theater and then were, I thought that story, of course, would be a case in point.

50:23.837 --> 50:27.322
I have an absolute exquisite copy of The Glass Menagerie.

50:27.362 --> 50:28.544
I have all of Tennessee Williams.

50:28.864 --> 50:29.265
Wow.

50:29.617 --> 50:30.338
I don't have that.

50:30.698 --> 50:32.821
And that was the first Williams that we got.

50:32.861 --> 50:34.443
My wife said, we have to have it.

50:34.463 --> 50:37.267
I said, hey, we don't collect Tennessee Williams.

50:37.287 --> 50:38.048
She said, we do now.

50:39.289 --> 50:40.571
It happens, doesn't it?

50:40.911 --> 50:49.142
And then I later learned about a guy, a Hollywood guy, who traded for which Hemingway?

50:49.642 --> 50:52.326
You know, really, The Sun Also Rises?

50:52.446 --> 50:53.387
That's the most difficult.

50:53.407 --> 50:55.009
I have that book, and I can't find it.

50:55.029 --> 50:55.750
Can you believe that?

50:56.391 --> 50:56.451
Ah.

50:56.802 --> 51:03.731
And so this guy trained a perfect copy of that for a perfect copy of the Grass Menagerie because he was so much wanted.

51:04.512 --> 51:06.175
I'd rather have the sun also rise.

51:06.195 --> 51:11.602
And I said, my God, I wish I'd known this movie guy because my copy is like God's copy.

51:11.662 --> 51:12.323
It's so beautiful.

51:12.543 --> 51:15.607
It's absolutely exquisite.

51:15.687 --> 51:16.508
Really mint copy.

51:16.528 --> 51:16.849
Yeah.

51:18.351 --> 51:23.258
I ran a few services at Bob Jackson's last night who showed me his book.

51:23.378 --> 51:24.379
Have you ever seen a copy of

51:25.102 --> 51:27.084
The grapes of wrath like this before?

51:27.805 --> 51:30.568
And I said, I hate to tell you, but I have one that's nicer than I do.

51:30.628 --> 51:34.912
I have one, same source, that looked like it came out of a time capsule.

51:34.932 --> 51:37.655
Yeah, well, mine isn't, mine is just average.

51:37.675 --> 51:38.256
I was just lucky.

51:38.276 --> 51:39.537
I got it on Cape Codafall.

51:39.738 --> 51:40.759
Is it signed?

51:41.439 --> 51:42.941
No, no, no.

51:42.961 --> 51:45.143
Then I wouldn't have gotten it for $150.

51:45.163 --> 51:46.585
Oh, yeah, I didn't hear you say it.

51:46.605 --> 51:48.987
I didn't say it, but it's perfect.

51:49.428 --> 51:51.430
Even then I knew I was stealing it at $150.

51:51.730 --> 51:52.792
And it's a first.

51:52.852 --> 51:55.215
But had it been said, I think Ralph would have recognized.

51:55.475 --> 51:57.118
Yeah.

51:58.340 --> 52:00.002
That was a wonderful movie.

52:00.022 --> 52:01.424
You must have East of Eden.

52:01.524 --> 52:02.105
No, I don't.

52:02.746 --> 52:04.709
You know, I'll tell you something about Steinbeck.

52:05.029 --> 52:09.516
I'm not a fan of his, and I never really enjoy his movies that much.

52:09.556 --> 52:21.113
The funny thing about his stuff, he always seems to be, there's always, the human being in Steinbeck's stuff seems to me to be

52:22.342 --> 52:24.565
brought down to a level of an animal.

52:25.746 --> 52:28.469
And if you think about it, if you ever read, I'm sure you had.

52:28.589 --> 52:30.091
I love Steinbeck, actually.

52:30.111 --> 52:35.818
Yeah, well, I just... We have a gentleman's disagreement here.

52:35.918 --> 52:41.365
Yeah, no, I gotta... I just, I cannot get with Steinbeck.

52:41.645 --> 52:43.547
You see the cool hand Luke up there.

52:43.567 --> 52:44.148
Yeah.

52:44.208 --> 52:44.909
This is great.

52:44.929 --> 52:45.590
You have mash.

52:45.990 --> 52:46.891
That must be tough.

52:47.091 --> 52:47.392
It is.

52:47.532 --> 52:49.294
I did not know that that was a book.

52:49.898 --> 52:51.300
You see, this is the problem.

52:51.380 --> 53:03.238
I mean, it's a difficult thing because, I mean, I haven't seen a copy of that M.A.S.H., and I get catalogs of Sheik, and I tell you, I get them forever.

53:04.480 --> 53:07.364
Try to find a copy of M.A.S.H., a decent copy.

53:07.384 --> 53:08.586
I haven't even seen a copy.

53:08.806 --> 53:10.408
Who is the author without getting that?

53:10.428 --> 53:11.690
I can't think right now.

53:11.810 --> 53:13.333
I'll get out.

53:13.353 --> 53:13.853
It's right there.

53:13.913 --> 53:15.636
When did you have this past couple?

53:16.443 --> 53:16.984
I had that.

53:17.024 --> 53:17.725
Oh, do you have that?

53:18.145 --> 53:18.786
Yeah.

53:18.826 --> 53:21.389
I have that in Advanced... Oh, that's terrific.

53:21.409 --> 53:26.635
Well, so MASH is by Richard Hooker, H-O-K-E-R, a novel about three Army doctors.

53:27.556 --> 53:29.118
And look at that wonderful dust jacket.

53:29.138 --> 53:29.238
Yeah.

53:30.640 --> 53:32.042
And what else did Richard Hooker do?

53:32.062 --> 53:34.044
It's Morrow, 1968.

53:34.064 --> 53:35.866
And the movie came out.

53:35.886 --> 53:36.687
I was in the Navy.

53:36.707 --> 53:38.469
I was on a ship in 1969.

53:38.489 --> 53:39.731
Well, we saw it.

53:39.971 --> 53:42.374
You know, we saw all the movies.

53:42.534 --> 53:45.758
We weren't in any wars in 1969, weren't we?

53:46.379 --> 54:02.294
I'll tell you, the most difficult book up there you'll probably get is to kill a mockingbird.

54:04.175 --> 54:07.058
I have a wonderful... Well, I've got that signed.

54:08.319 --> 54:09.941
You have that signed?

54:10.581 --> 54:15.846
Yeah, I've got two kinds of, one a Canadian edition and the American edition.

54:16.248 --> 54:19.052
I didn't know she signed books.

54:19.553 --> 54:25.341
Not only that, I have a postcard from her and the other one with her farm.

54:25.401 --> 54:26.202
She lives in a farm.

54:26.222 --> 54:31.049
I can't think of her up east in the eastern seaboard somewhere.

54:31.169 --> 54:35.135
That is a very, very difficult book to find.

54:35.716 --> 54:36.837
Very difficult to find.

54:37.018 --> 54:40.322
And you know we did the dust jacket picture from Capote.

54:40.342 --> 54:42.846
Yeah, well, of course, that's what the book was...

54:43.062 --> 54:44.204
He was the character.

54:44.264 --> 54:44.885
That's right.

54:44.905 --> 54:47.969
The rumor is, you know, that that's the reason she only did one book.

54:47.989 --> 54:48.830
Maybe he did it.

54:49.211 --> 54:50.032
He actually wrote it.

54:51.034 --> 54:51.594
I saw him.

54:51.614 --> 54:56.762
She helped him so much on, you know, one of those books there, which one it was.

54:57.663 --> 54:59.185
He was a real unusual guy.

54:59.325 --> 55:03.872
We were staying at the Sherry Netherlands one time in New York, and downstairs,

55:05.101 --> 55:07.564
I'm sure you get into New York.

55:07.664 --> 55:11.149
Well, that's the very place, hotel, where I interview Mario Puzo.

55:11.510 --> 55:15.375
Yeah, well, you know where the little dining room is or anything like that.

55:15.435 --> 55:22.464
As you walk in for the elevator, there's an elevator straight back, and you go downstairs, and there's the Raffles Club downstairs.

55:24.667 --> 55:25.969
I couldn't get into that.

55:26.169 --> 55:32.217
I wanted to see that club, because it's an English club, and I wanted to see that club.

55:32.237 --> 55:34.180
So I don't think you got down there.

55:34.835 --> 55:35.857
I got down there.

55:37.621 --> 55:39.204
I waited upstairs.

55:39.224 --> 55:40.126
Yeah, yeah.

55:40.146 --> 55:42.491
I've never told you, but I gave this guy 50 bucks.

55:43.232 --> 55:45.557
He took me down.

55:45.597 --> 55:49.445
Well, Bob, what do you think of that?

55:49.685 --> 55:52.010
Who do you suppose is sitting there by himself?

55:52.030 --> 55:54.936
It was Capote.

55:56.030 --> 55:58.773
So what was the attraction of the club for you?

55:58.793 --> 55:59.373
Why was it so cool?

55:59.393 --> 56:00.314
Because I've heard of it.

56:00.354 --> 56:02.676
I mean, Christ, everybody's heard of the Raffles Club.

56:03.877 --> 56:11.825
I used to sit there, of course, being an Ohio Rube, you know, and I'd sit there and I'd see these Bugattis coming up, and I loved the hotel.

56:12.465 --> 56:16.128
When we'd go to New York, we'd stay at the Sherry Netherlands.

56:16.149 --> 56:21.834
And you see these huge cars come in, and these famous people would be walking by, and it was a great bar there.

56:21.894 --> 56:23.235
You could look out the window.

56:24.008 --> 56:29.314
And then we were having breakfast one morning, and what's her name, was sitting right next to her.

56:29.334 --> 56:30.836
Every time we went there.

56:30.956 --> 56:34.641
Every time we went there, somebody... Yeah, she was right there.

56:34.661 --> 56:44.953
She's got a book out right now that's just carrying Philip Roth.

56:44.973 --> 56:45.794
Just in there.

56:45.874 --> 56:46.194
Why?

56:47.616 --> 56:48.998
She got some sort of a thing about him?

56:49.018 --> 56:50.419
He's a tough guy to live with, I guess.

56:50.439 --> 56:52.682
There was...

56:53.219 --> 56:56.543
quite a piece about it in the New York Times.

56:56.563 --> 57:04.693
But that, I think, of all hotels in New York, and I understand all hotels in New York, but that is a nifty hotel to stay in to see people.

57:04.833 --> 57:06.855
I'm not sure you can even still stay there.

57:06.995 --> 57:08.998
Maybe I'll, you know, rent it up.

57:09.038 --> 57:11.180
No, because... Well, Mario was there.

57:11.201 --> 57:15.145
They had a tough-less suite, and we were looking over Central Park.

57:15.165 --> 57:16.086
It was wonderful.

57:16.106 --> 57:17.248
It's right there in the 50s.

57:17.268 --> 57:18.669
Oh, great spot.

57:18.830 --> 57:20.632
Right on Fifth Avenue.

57:20.692 --> 57:21.533
There it is.

57:21.573 --> 57:21.673
Yeah.

57:21.822 --> 57:27.187
You know, walking out too far, you go down to Albert Sacks down there if you want to see some great antiques and all that stuff.

57:27.207 --> 57:27.808
He was late.

57:27.908 --> 57:29.449
I was there right at the time.

57:29.469 --> 57:33.373
He showed up with his bags upon bags of cigars.

57:33.674 --> 57:34.414
Cheap cigars.

57:35.475 --> 57:35.996
Cheap?

57:36.356 --> 57:37.738
You know, because he can't really smoke them.

57:37.798 --> 57:39.439
He just chews on them.

57:39.459 --> 57:39.719
Really?

57:39.739 --> 57:40.480
Because he's going to have a cigar.

57:40.500 --> 57:42.162
I thought it was going to be a really good cigar.

57:42.242 --> 57:43.603
I used to smoke cigars.

57:44.124 --> 57:44.564
Terrible.

57:45.345 --> 57:46.106
Cigars are in.

57:46.126 --> 57:47.167
You ought to go back to them.

57:47.587 --> 57:49.049
Oh, my point.

57:50.250 --> 57:50.530
Yeah.

57:50.780 --> 57:52.161
My wife got me equipment.

57:52.942 --> 57:55.044
We get along just fine with these things.

57:56.305 --> 57:57.166
I love the cigars.

57:58.047 --> 58:05.174
But, let's see, we're... So, actually... I guess I was asking you what you want less, though.

58:06.796 --> 58:16.405
Yeah, you know, I don't think I really have one much anymore because of the movies.

58:18.087 --> 58:20.449
The style of the movies that's out today, of course,

58:20.902 --> 58:24.908
You know, I mean, I could go out and get a first edition of the new ones.

58:25.669 --> 58:34.061
The older ones, I'm not sure there's anything out there that I really would want that bad.

58:34.462 --> 58:35.684
Well, how about Tom Jones?

58:36.825 --> 58:43.535
Well, you see, that, as a matter of fact, what's-his-name's got a copy of that, Chilton.

58:44.517 --> 58:44.697
Thompson.

58:44.717 --> 58:44.817
Yeah.

58:45.505 --> 58:50.416
And now you're talking, a copy of Tom Jones probably cost you $10,000.

58:51.919 --> 58:52.560
You know, anyhow.

58:52.580 --> 58:54.144
What I'm suggesting is that there are limits.

58:54.164 --> 58:54.705
No, no.

58:54.966 --> 58:56.289
And that was a wonderful movie.

58:56.309 --> 58:57.090
Wonderful movie.

58:57.110 --> 59:01.540
It was a wonderful movie, but it wasn't the kind of movie that stirred my soul.

59:03.325 --> 59:06.710
In other words, I enjoyed it, and I think it was great.

59:06.730 --> 59:08.894
Did Bonfire on the Fanatys show you?

59:08.934 --> 59:10.436
No, I just happened to pick that.

59:10.456 --> 59:11.438
I got that for nothing.

59:11.678 --> 59:17.868
As a matter of fact, I'm about to take it down from there because I don't have the room.

59:18.269 --> 59:20.132
You're going to take it from this side over to there?

59:20.372 --> 59:22.295
No, no, no room over there.

59:22.676 --> 59:24.979
No room at that end over there.

59:25.260 --> 59:30.548
There's like, remember the movie Charlie with Cliff Robertson?

59:31.591 --> 59:34.295
Claire Bloom was in that, as a matter of fact.

59:34.315 --> 59:36.337
I wonder, he won the Oscar in that.

59:36.357 --> 59:41.324
Yeah, but maybe, but see... That was from a story called Flowers for Algernon, and so it was a different title.

59:41.644 --> 59:45.649
Do you have many cases where the title changed from the book to the... Oh, sure.

59:45.930 --> 59:53.319
Sure, for instance, I mean, today, I mean, looking at a coffin for Demetrius, but the movie was a mask for Demetrius.

59:53.900 --> 59:55.883
You've got that one reference book.

59:55.903 --> 01:00:00.028
I have a reference book on, shows you the difference in the names.

01:00:00.717 --> 01:00:04.661
Well, The Day of the Condor was three days of the Condor.

01:00:04.681 --> 01:00:06.042
Three days of the Condor.

01:00:06.062 --> 01:00:06.342
Yeah.

01:00:06.362 --> 01:00:07.623
That was Robert Redford.

01:00:07.643 --> 01:00:08.684
That was a hell of a movie.

01:00:09.125 --> 01:00:09.445
Yeah.

01:00:09.465 --> 01:00:14.570
There's a guy in my book, Walter Forzheimer, who that character was modeled on.

01:00:14.590 --> 01:00:14.930
Really?

01:00:15.130 --> 01:00:17.733
Yeah, it's in my book.

01:00:17.753 --> 01:00:17.853
Yeah.

01:00:17.933 --> 01:00:20.956
Now, that's a wonderful movie, but that's not a difficult book to get.

01:00:21.216 --> 01:00:22.137
It shouldn't be.

01:00:22.157 --> 01:00:22.637
No, no.

01:00:22.657 --> 01:00:23.698
Because it's fairly recent.
