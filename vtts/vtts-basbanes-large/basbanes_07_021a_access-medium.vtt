00:02.714 --> 00:08.740
We're talking with Dan Kosnansky, we're in New York, just so we can identify this.

00:08.760 --> 00:12.603
I have to get this close to you, because what you have to say is more important than what I have to say.

00:12.903 --> 00:13.664
No, I wouldn't say that.

00:13.844 --> 00:16.287
I look at it as if you wear a street.

00:16.387 --> 00:19.730
Because I'm as interested in you.

00:20.010 --> 00:20.370
Thank you.

00:20.851 --> 00:22.813
Can you tell me about your own collecting?

00:22.993 --> 00:25.335
Yeah, we're talking about dust jackets.

00:25.435 --> 00:30.780
I met her when she first got into business.

00:31.064 --> 00:33.307
I had just gotten a divorce in several years.

00:35.110 --> 00:38.515
Just completely swore up women.

00:38.775 --> 00:45.224
Then a friend of mine gave me her first catalog, and there was a book in it for $25, which had a parody of Sherlock Holmes.

00:45.244 --> 00:46.145
It was in a dust jack.

00:47.347 --> 00:53.356
So I immediately made an appointment, and of course the book had been sold.

00:53.876 --> 00:57.882
The book had been sold.

00:59.313 --> 01:07.128
But I saw Facilla, and we developed a mutual liking for each other.

01:07.148 --> 01:13.399
Although some time went by, six months later, she called me up and asked me if I wanted to go to lunch.

01:13.700 --> 01:17.507
And we did, and then six months later after that, she called me up again.

01:17.740 --> 01:20.227
She said, would you like to go to lunch again or dinner?

01:21.170 --> 01:23.718
And then after dinner, then we've been together ever since.

01:23.778 --> 01:24.540
That's how we met.

01:24.560 --> 01:28.271
She's now about seven or eight years.

01:28.291 --> 01:31.260
She's been in business about seven, eight or nine years.

01:31.561 --> 01:41.995
I almost feel it's more than that.

01:42.255 --> 01:48.984
She's only had it for about seven years.

01:49.345 --> 01:50.426
It could be.

01:50.446 --> 01:52.269
It's always been there.

01:52.429 --> 01:54.632
Yeah, it should be.

01:54.612 --> 01:57.877
But, well, she worked in publishing for a long time.

01:57.957 --> 02:02.163
She worked for Harcourt Brace Javanovic.

02:02.183 --> 02:05.848
She was Javanovic's personal secretary.

02:05.868 --> 02:14.540
And then she went into, she became the director of the Franklin Refrain series, in charge of all of the rights.

02:14.560 --> 02:20.188
So she dealt with all these individual authors, William Soraya and all those people.

02:21.370 --> 02:23.573
And then she went from there and worked for John Fleming.

02:24.346 --> 02:27.970
She worked for John for two years.

02:28.711 --> 02:30.933
And John said, you know, you know everything that I know.

02:32.535 --> 02:35.658
He said, it's time for you to go out on your own.

02:35.678 --> 02:38.041
So she went out on her own.

02:38.421 --> 02:40.864
He was the greatest.

02:40.964 --> 02:42.185
He was the greatest.

02:43.987 --> 02:47.611
But he helped her get started.

02:47.631 --> 02:50.134
And then about...

02:50.873 --> 02:55.820
Two or three years after I met her, they formed a partnership.

02:55.980 --> 02:56.681
Fleming and Priscilla.

02:56.741 --> 02:59.165
What was the name of the company?

02:59.185 --> 03:00.507
John Fleming and Priscilla Javallis.

03:00.527 --> 03:03.251
And they put out two big catalogs together.

03:03.271 --> 03:05.254
Out of New York or out of Boston?

03:05.794 --> 03:06.375
Both.

03:06.395 --> 03:08.158
All dealing with Libre d'Artiste.

03:08.759 --> 03:13.165
And you must see those catalogs to get a sense of what Priscilla's done.

03:13.185 --> 03:15.388
I know we're going to talk about other things, but I'm telling you.

03:15.588 --> 03:16.830
She's probably without...

03:17.452 --> 03:22.446
She won't tell you, but I'd say she was number one in the world in her field.

03:22.466 --> 03:24.732
Without telling you how much business she does or all that.

03:24.752 --> 03:27.700
I have the Abrams book for the introduction.

03:27.720 --> 03:29.605
You have to look at the catalog.

03:29.922 --> 03:35.507
But you have to be accomplished to even get a commission like that.

03:36.368 --> 03:37.849
And they came to her.

03:37.870 --> 03:39.351
There's a level of attrition.

03:39.371 --> 03:40.472
I mean, people fall by.

03:40.772 --> 03:42.574
You don't just arrive at this point.

03:42.714 --> 03:44.656
The Art Deco book you're talking about.

03:44.676 --> 03:45.677
That's exactly right.

03:45.777 --> 03:51.923
Well, the reason they came to her was she sold most of the books in that book.

03:52.263 --> 03:55.506
So they could not get the photographs without going to her.

03:56.107 --> 03:57.448
Because the owners...

03:57.918 --> 04:01.502
would say to them, hey, you check with Priscilla if she says it's okay.

04:01.542 --> 04:09.289
And then they came to her for the preface and all that stuff.

04:09.309 --> 04:16.176
So I'm not saying anything that is really not known or anything like that, but she's in her own way.

04:16.216 --> 04:21.742
She's just, this is her thing.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.764
I've been a book collector for all of my life.

04:23.784 --> 04:25.286
How old are you?

04:25.306 --> 04:25.766
I'm 52.

04:25.786 --> 04:27.688
Congratulations.

04:28.630 --> 04:35.199
I'm 52, and I was raised in the Bronx.

04:35.679 --> 04:44.010
My parents were immigrants, one from Russia and one from Poland, and I was born in Israel.

04:44.030 --> 04:46.674
And I came here when I was about two or three.

04:47.375 --> 04:48.516
Was Israel Israel?

04:48.576 --> 04:49.778
No, it was Palestine.

04:49.994 --> 05:00.620
My father was a great book collector and a stamp collector.

05:00.640 --> 05:04.129
He escaped Russia by selling his stamp collection.

05:04.149 --> 05:05.472
He was about 14 years old.

05:05.924 --> 05:15.498
He ice skated across the Dnieper River into Europe, and that's how he eventually made his way to Israel.

05:16.940 --> 05:25.873
Leo, first name, Hosnansky, as it is now, with a J in it.

05:25.853 --> 05:29.997
Well, it was P-O-S-N-J-A-N-S-K-Y.

05:30.358 --> 05:37.345
And when we went through Ellis Island, the guy at the gate said, hey, you don't need that J. Why does the family have a story like that?

05:37.545 --> 05:44.913
He said, you don't need that J. And he crossed out the J and sent us into the delousing showers, which I guess everybody did.

05:46.014 --> 05:50.359
And we came out clean, but no J. That's it.

05:50.660 --> 06:00.173
In my book, so I'll make sure we're working there, which we are, it's just a curious circumstance.

06:00.193 --> 06:10.969
And I'm not so sure now, it's coincidental, but a surprisingly high number, a large number of my siblings say Jewish.

06:10.989 --> 06:16.937
Jewish people have a strong love, not just love, I mean, commitment to books.

06:17.057 --> 06:20.582
And no, it's totally right.

06:20.900 --> 06:23.685
I'm just trying to do a book and I'm taking it the way it comes.

06:23.705 --> 06:24.847
There's going to be women fun.

06:24.867 --> 06:26.130
There's going to be black straight.

06:26.650 --> 06:29.836
And I'm just going up to the most interesting... Well, you say put it on the record.

06:29.856 --> 06:32.481
I'm not... I mean, I am exactly what you see.

06:32.541 --> 06:36.348
And it's never bothered me.

06:36.368 --> 06:39.634
I've always done pretty much what I wanted to do.

06:39.901 --> 06:41.662
You work in education.

06:41.763 --> 06:48.128
You mentioned to me the vice president of Emerson College for construction, development, and real estate.

06:48.268 --> 06:50.530
So I do all their real estate purchase and sales.

06:50.630 --> 06:53.513
I do all the renovation of their buildings.

06:53.533 --> 06:57.616
And now I'm also responsible for all of their fundraising efforts.

06:58.317 --> 07:04.522
Recently, I took over the management of a 15-person fundraising department that wasn't doing too well.

07:05.142 --> 07:07.264
Prior to that, I was at Harvard for 12 years.

07:07.284 --> 07:09.486
I taught at Harvard University.

07:10.090 --> 07:15.719
I raised money for Harvard, one particular project, $6 million for the Graduate School of Education.

07:15.759 --> 07:16.881
What did you teach?

07:16.901 --> 07:17.622
Urban Education.

07:17.802 --> 07:22.891
I taught with Nathan Glazer, a prominent sociologist.

07:23.331 --> 07:26.857
And I built the Gutman Library of the Graduate School of Education.

07:27.618 --> 07:31.444
And I also taught at Simmons for about five or six years.

07:31.545 --> 07:32.326
Five or six years.

07:32.466 --> 07:34.309
I would say...

07:34.525 --> 07:41.255
In the 70s, in the mid 70s, 72, 70s.

07:43.619 --> 07:45.061
Before that, I was in New York.

07:46.723 --> 07:51.711
I was raised in the Bronx and worked at the New York Public Library for many years.

07:53.153 --> 07:56.518
I went to school a hundred times.

07:56.538 --> 07:59.963
I did my graduate work, got my master's degree from Columbia.

07:59.983 --> 08:03.368
I was an administrative assistant to Cardinal Spellman for years.

08:03.854 --> 08:05.476
Then my wife got into Harvard.

08:05.496 --> 08:07.058
I was married at the time.

08:07.078 --> 08:08.540
So I dropped everything in New York.

08:09.822 --> 08:11.765
And we moved up to Massachusetts.

08:11.785 --> 08:14.328
I walked in off the street and got a job.

08:15.409 --> 08:18.373
For what year is this?

08:18.393 --> 08:21.818
This would have been in, uh, 68.

08:22.339 --> 08:24.361
So you've been up here for 22 years?

08:24.381 --> 08:24.802
Yeah, about 22 years.

08:24.822 --> 08:26.504
We moved to Nashville, New Hampshire first.

08:26.524 --> 08:27.746
I bought a house, my first house.

08:28.727 --> 08:30.790
And then we moved to Georgetown, Massachusetts.

08:31.175 --> 08:35.240
and then I got divorced, and then I moved to Boston, and then I'm like, it's all okay.

08:35.781 --> 08:46.114
All the while, I collected rare books, throughout everything, from when I was growing up in the Bronx, and that's when I met Bethelman, when I was about 11 or 12 years old.

08:46.575 --> 08:49.238
You started collecting at age what?

08:49.318 --> 08:49.518
Age 11.

08:49.538 --> 08:54.224
And this is something you derived from your father.

08:54.244 --> 08:54.745
I guess so.

08:55.085 --> 08:55.986
I mean, did you read?

08:56.006 --> 08:57.989
Oh yeah, I read everything I collected.

08:58.009 --> 09:00.172
I mean, did you know that you were collecting?

09:00.312 --> 09:00.372
No.

09:00.723 --> 09:09.313
Yeah, because I bought books from Lou Fellman on Sherlock Holmes if there was a small imprint, let's say one of 25 copies of that.

09:09.834 --> 09:11.536
Right, that's right.

09:11.616 --> 09:12.958
Right here in Manhattan.

09:12.978 --> 09:13.118
Right.

09:13.519 --> 09:15.841
The first place was on Madison Avenue.

09:15.881 --> 09:17.684
He had moved from Long Island.

09:17.704 --> 09:18.044
Right.

09:18.064 --> 09:20.527
See, his name was Lou David Fellman.

09:20.547 --> 09:20.727
Right.

09:21.028 --> 09:24.692
But his name was E-L-D-I-E-F-F.

09:24.912 --> 09:25.233
Yeah.

09:25.253 --> 09:26.394
The house of L-E-F.

09:26.414 --> 09:27.135
The house of L-E-F.

09:27.318 --> 09:32.128
And he was a nice little rotundal guy with a very dapper looking, little pencil mustache.

09:32.489 --> 09:34.694
And you went in by yourself?

09:34.714 --> 09:37.800
In Dungarees, in Dungarees by myself at age 12.

09:38.943 --> 09:43.052
Do you remember the first time you went in?

09:43.513 --> 09:45.597
No, but I can remember like the first 10 times.

09:45.948 --> 09:49.813
I bought from Lou and I also bought from Scribner's rare book store.

09:50.074 --> 09:51.536
Scribner's used to have a rare book shop.

09:51.576 --> 09:53.979
How did you find Lou?

09:55.141 --> 09:58.145
Somebody told me he had specialized in Sherlock Holmes.

09:58.165 --> 10:01.710
And I came to know that he was a member of the Baker Street Irregulars.

10:03.813 --> 10:05.996
And that's what got me to Lou in the beginning.

10:06.016 --> 10:08.640
And I pressed the buzzer and walked in.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.162
This was on Madison Avenue?

10:10.182 --> 10:11.143
On Madison Avenue.

10:11.163 --> 10:13.707
He had, it was right off Madison.

10:13.727 --> 10:15.229
And I actually was on the corner.

10:15.547 --> 10:26.157
and he had purple velvet curtains in his window that would be drawn by a gold-braided bell pole and from the sign, House of LDF.

10:26.177 --> 10:27.638
It was a very small place.

10:27.738 --> 10:32.863
I'd say, oh, maybe 1,200 square feet in total space.

10:33.324 --> 10:40.210
He had a cataloger himself and his son and a wonderful big boxer dog.

10:40.230 --> 10:42.432
And that was the most wonderful dog.

10:42.749 --> 10:43.750
Do you remember his dog's name?

10:44.030 --> 10:46.072
I know you're going to ask me that.

10:46.152 --> 10:48.034
And I did remember the name.

10:48.175 --> 10:49.696
What's the son's name?

10:50.136 --> 10:51.117
Joel.

10:51.138 --> 10:52.519
Joel's still alive?

10:53.940 --> 10:55.162
Still alive.

10:55.182 --> 10:56.623
You're not very talkative.

10:56.743 --> 10:57.364
Yeah.

10:57.444 --> 10:57.684
Okay.

10:57.704 --> 10:58.705
Why don't you get some food?

10:58.725 --> 10:58.905
Okay.

10:58.925 --> 10:59.666
Shut me off.

11:01.588 --> 11:01.928
All right.

11:01.948 --> 11:03.370
So we were talking about food.

11:03.390 --> 11:03.550
Yeah.

11:03.650 --> 11:04.992
And I'm really interested in it.

11:05.012 --> 11:05.852
Now, let me explain.

11:05.953 --> 11:10.537
One of my chapters is really going to be about the University of Texas.

11:10.617 --> 11:11.338
Mm-hmm.

11:11.690 --> 11:14.773
He was their exclusive agent.

11:14.813 --> 11:16.435
Texas did 15 years.

11:16.895 --> 11:18.116
Phenomenal.

11:18.276 --> 11:21.179
Quite extraordinary.

11:21.239 --> 11:26.324
And I'm not in any way suggesting any kind of impropriety.

11:26.484 --> 11:29.727
I've got nothing on that.

11:29.747 --> 11:31.569
And I'm not looking at it.

11:31.589 --> 11:33.070
If it were there, I'd go after it.

11:34.412 --> 11:38.155
I know you would.

11:38.175 --> 11:39.537
And I know the story.

11:39.577 --> 11:40.077
I know

11:40.732 --> 11:43.696
how jealous other book dealers were of his success.

11:44.236 --> 11:45.838
You know who I'm talking to Monday?

11:45.959 --> 11:47.320
It's Charles Hamilton.

11:47.481 --> 11:48.982
Hamilton, absolutely.

11:49.383 --> 11:49.964
He's one of them.

11:49.984 --> 11:50.925
And he libeled.

11:51.165 --> 11:51.686
He libeled?

11:51.766 --> 11:52.026
Right.

11:52.407 --> 11:56.873
The only reason there was no loss is because both men were dead.

11:56.893 --> 12:02.760
Had they been alive, he said in that book, Auction Madness, was absolutely libelous.

12:02.780 --> 12:05.363
Now, Hamilton is a main man.

12:06.064 --> 12:08.387
I'm calling him Monday, and we're going to talk.

12:08.808 --> 12:09.068
Good.

12:09.419 --> 12:15.406
And then at some point in this discussion, I'm going to ask him to back up what he said in that book.

12:15.426 --> 12:16.046
We're too late.

12:17.388 --> 12:18.529
So there's some evidence.

12:18.549 --> 12:23.234
Luke Feldman and Harry Ransom got together, and they bought books, and they made millions of dollars.

12:24.055 --> 12:25.857
And we're now signing one.

12:26.478 --> 12:28.480
Hey, I want facts.

12:28.900 --> 12:31.744
You got evidence to back this up?

12:31.784 --> 12:34.867
That's an extraordinary statement.

12:34.967 --> 12:36.709
And nobody, and I told the people who were texting

12:37.060 --> 12:38.662
John Chalmers is the right one.

12:38.863 --> 12:39.624
He says, doing that?

12:40.365 --> 12:41.146
See, they're afraid now.

12:41.166 --> 12:42.828
They're very gun-shy.

12:42.909 --> 12:44.050
I went down there.

12:45.933 --> 12:46.914
They ran it to them.

12:46.934 --> 12:49.438
They thought I was coming in to do another job.

12:49.498 --> 12:50.099
I'm not.

12:50.960 --> 12:54.425
And the only way I'm going to get them to believe this is when they see the clock.

12:54.525 --> 12:56.068
I think it's a good thing to do.

12:56.108 --> 13:01.876
By the same token, I have to confront him and I have to tell the story who was their exclusive agent in New York City.

13:01.896 --> 13:02.437
That's a fact.

13:02.497 --> 13:03.118
Exactly.

13:03.284 --> 13:04.065
That's a fact.

13:04.165 --> 13:04.666
Exactly.

13:05.267 --> 13:07.150
And I am interested in that.

13:07.170 --> 13:10.816
And what I can see is that Harry liked Feldman.

13:11.557 --> 13:11.677
Right.

13:11.697 --> 13:14.101
No, I'm talking too much.

13:14.181 --> 13:15.303
I want to hear you talk.

13:15.503 --> 13:17.907
No, he did like Feldman.

13:18.408 --> 13:24.277
And I don't know much about Harry Ransom, but I know a lot about him.

13:25.259 --> 13:26.941
I've got other people who know Harry Ransom.

13:27.001 --> 13:30.507
I know a ton about Harry Ransom.

13:32.393 --> 13:43.366
Well, that's why it's so vivid in my memory.

13:43.386 --> 13:46.549
That's what Priscilla knows.

13:46.930 --> 13:51.014
My memory is really good.

13:53.197 --> 13:56.681
And the box of doors is sitting there as you walk in.

13:56.701 --> 14:00.325
It's a rather small place lined with shelves and top

14:00.727 --> 14:07.598
It's about it, you know, with a ladder that comes along so we can go up to the top of that stuff.

14:07.618 --> 14:10.423
Lou, as I said, was a member of the Baker Street Irregulars.

14:10.924 --> 14:14.570
The Baker Street Irregulars were a Sherlock Holmes group founded in 1934.

14:14.650 --> 14:16.253
Paul Foxen was a friend of mine.

14:16.433 --> 14:16.553
Right.

14:16.854 --> 14:17.876
I knew Paul very well.

14:18.577 --> 14:18.817
Okay.

14:18.837 --> 14:19.037
Right.

14:19.058 --> 14:20.700
And I got a lot of his collection.

14:20.720 --> 14:22.223
And the Friends of God of Life.

14:22.243 --> 14:24.186
Oh, okay.

14:24.453 --> 14:28.217
And I do the Clarkson Lecture Room.

14:28.457 --> 14:31.800
The Worcester area, I should have figured that out.

14:31.820 --> 14:34.123
But Paul was a member of the Baker Street Regulars.

14:34.883 --> 14:37.146
He was also a member of the Silver Dagger Club.

14:37.206 --> 14:37.446
Right.

14:40.669 --> 14:43.312
So I know where you're at.

14:43.972 --> 14:45.294
So Lou is a member of that.

14:46.075 --> 14:51.540
In fact, every year he used to give a prize, the Lou Feldman Prize, for the best original essay

14:51.790 --> 14:59.078
delivered at the annual meeting of $100.

14:59.779 --> 15:05.165
The group was founded in 1934 by Christopher Morey and a few friends.

15:05.185 --> 15:11.192
They have a menu, the original menu from the first meeting, signed by everybody who was at the meeting.

15:11.212 --> 15:12.474
There were 13 people.

15:13.235 --> 15:16.238
And that was the beginning of it, really.

15:16.739 --> 15:20.683
Franklin Roosevelt was a member, a correspondent from Roosevelt.

15:21.068 --> 15:27.578
talking about his exclusive retreat in Warm Springs in the South, in Arkansas.

15:27.879 --> 15:29.521
Yeah, he was a member of the program.

15:29.782 --> 15:31.965
He was, he was a great collector.

15:32.185 --> 15:41.440
But what he did with Sherlock Holmes was, most people don't know this, he had an area of Warm Springs, one of the streets, he dubbed Baker Street.

15:42.241 --> 15:47.970
And the area that his Secret Service stayed, the building, was called 221B.

15:48.406 --> 15:51.609
This is a true story, and it's well-documented.

15:51.869 --> 15:55.293
I have letters from him, from his secretary, Grace Tully.

15:55.313 --> 15:57.195
It's not from Ellen, but in prickly, is it?

15:57.875 --> 15:59.517
Yes, it is.

15:59.877 --> 15:59.997
It is?

16:00.618 --> 16:03.861
I'll show you the book of his letters.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.022
I mean, in print.

16:05.663 --> 16:08.866
By in print, I mean between hard covers.

16:08.886 --> 16:09.547
I don't think so.

16:09.707 --> 16:10.208
That's what I mean.

16:10.228 --> 16:14.452
No, but some of his letters have been published in a very small quantity.

16:14.492 --> 16:17.755
This might be something nice for me to use there, wouldn't it?

16:17.887 --> 16:24.137
I think it's interesting to connect Lou with this episode of Ivor's life.

16:24.197 --> 16:29.164
In any case, I was an average Sherlock Holmes nun.

16:29.265 --> 16:31.468
From the beginning.

16:31.949 --> 16:33.351
And so I went to Lou.

16:33.371 --> 16:37.397
Lou was on very good terms with all of the Sherlockians across the country.

16:37.883 --> 16:39.606
And it's a very strange group.

16:39.686 --> 16:41.749
It cuts across all economic segments.

16:41.930 --> 16:43.733
Some were very poor, some were very wealthy.

16:44.494 --> 16:47.760
A lot of them published their own stuff and limited money.

16:48.260 --> 16:52.187
Lou would buy, let's say, if there was a run of 150, Lou would buy 100 of them.

16:52.868 --> 16:53.930
And then he would mark it up.

16:54.050 --> 16:58.317
Let's say if it was $10 originally, he'd mark it to $12.50.

16:58.337 --> 17:00.040
And he'd have a whole stack of them.

17:00.060 --> 17:01.262
So I'd go in there.

17:02.324 --> 17:04.127
As they would come out, I'd buy these new things.

17:04.613 --> 17:07.456
And occasionally I'd buy a book, a good book.

17:07.476 --> 17:08.817
How old were you at this point?

17:09.178 --> 17:10.299
About 13, 14.

17:11.099 --> 17:13.422
Did he take a liking to you?

17:13.562 --> 17:14.102
Oh, yeah.

17:14.123 --> 17:15.984
Where did he buy you?

17:16.004 --> 17:16.104
Then.

17:16.125 --> 17:17.266
Then?

17:17.286 --> 17:18.707
Then I would buy a book.

17:18.947 --> 17:26.395
As I got more money, and as I began working in earnest at the New York Public Library, I got a little more cash to spend.

17:26.875 --> 17:28.777
So I'd buy a book, I'd say, for $50.

17:29.578 --> 17:31.560
He'd let me take a year to pay $50.

17:31.580 --> 17:33.642
The reason you're willing to buy books

17:35.630 --> 17:47.786
I'm telling you how nice the loop was to me.

17:47.806 --> 17:54.274
Let's say with the machine running, you don't mind if I write about you and use your name.

17:55.536 --> 17:57.158
I don't care.

17:57.178 --> 17:57.739
I don't care.

17:59.356 --> 18:04.424
As I said, anything I tell you, one way that I've always gotten along is to tell the truth.

18:04.784 --> 18:07.428
And you understand that you're talking to a professional writer.

18:07.448 --> 18:11.615
I wouldn't be here if I wouldn't have the material that I could use in a book.

18:12.436 --> 18:13.177
We understand that.

18:13.318 --> 18:13.898
Yeah.

18:13.918 --> 18:18.926
I mean, if you say something... I don't want Janet Malcolm... No.

18:19.287 --> 18:24.655
But if you say something, and it's something that...

18:24.905 --> 18:30.856
It has a fact attached to it, and you want to print it, and you just want to be sure, so call me up, and I'll tell you.

18:30.976 --> 18:32.499
Of course, of course.

18:32.519 --> 18:34.623
To me, quotes will say they have to be right.

18:34.683 --> 18:35.745
That's why I like that.

18:36.226 --> 18:37.108
Okay, go ahead.

18:37.208 --> 18:41.175
So I started buying books from Lou.

18:42.168 --> 18:43.690
And he would carry me along.

18:43.730 --> 18:46.973
He became sort of my mentor in the rare book collective.

18:46.993 --> 18:48.575
Is he knowledgeable for that?

18:48.755 --> 18:49.396
Incredible.

18:49.436 --> 18:51.678
You see, one of the raps against him is that he wasn't.

18:52.159 --> 18:53.460
Incredibly knowledgeable.

18:53.480 --> 18:54.481
So that's belonging.

18:54.501 --> 18:55.803
Right, total belonging.

18:55.903 --> 18:59.307
He started off on Long Island, but he moved to New York.

19:00.228 --> 19:02.650
He was always a bookman, first and foremost.

19:03.211 --> 19:08.477
When he bought at auction in Sotheby's and Parkland, he was buying many times for a stock.

19:08.537 --> 19:10.639
People thought he was buying for clients.

19:11.463 --> 19:15.288
And really when he started buying Texas, they all assumed he was buying Texas.

19:15.308 --> 19:15.628
Right.

19:15.769 --> 19:16.990
But he was a great showman.

19:17.651 --> 19:20.174
You know, he'd go, like John Fleming.

19:20.194 --> 19:22.257
He was very similar to John Fleming.

19:22.277 --> 19:23.819
Well, it wasn't something that was about him.

19:23.839 --> 19:23.999
Right.

19:24.019 --> 19:27.404
Now, he didn't have the benefit of having to work for Rosenbach, but John had.

19:27.864 --> 19:30.588
So John's knowledge was broader in a sense.

19:31.609 --> 19:38.398
But Lou was self-taught, and he moved right on through, and he knew as much about Incarnabula

19:38.632 --> 19:41.015
as much as he did detective fiction.

19:41.035 --> 19:41.736
Oh, absolutely.

19:42.137 --> 19:43.819
And detective fiction, he was all alone.

19:45.020 --> 19:46.963
There was nobody, absolutely all alone.

19:47.263 --> 19:50.507
And you say this is a person who's been collecting this stuff for 40 days?

19:51.368 --> 19:51.849
Yeah, all my life.

19:51.869 --> 19:52.149
All my life.

19:52.169 --> 19:52.550
That's right.

19:52.630 --> 19:53.451
Yeah, exactly.

19:55.173 --> 19:56.155
But he was all alone.

19:56.555 --> 20:01.682
And when he died, the field was completely vacant.

20:01.702 --> 20:03.424
And actually, a young guy,

20:03.590 --> 20:20.685
who I started in business by giving him the material for his first catalog, Peter Stern, Pepper and Stern, who was working for... I think you said that you pointed down... I'm sorry, towards the exhibition center, right?

20:20.905 --> 20:22.086
I pointed, right?

20:22.326 --> 20:24.748
Sorry, the machine can't see.

20:25.149 --> 20:26.290
Right, you said that right.

20:29.672 --> 20:32.635
He worked for a book dealer in Boston when I first met him.

20:32.750 --> 20:34.172
That's a quote.

20:34.333 --> 20:38.860
And then I gave him the material for his first stroke.

20:38.880 --> 20:39.681
He had it on.

20:41.003 --> 20:44.429
And that's when he went out on his own.

20:44.449 --> 20:47.934
And now he has become the leading dealer in detective fiction.

20:49.156 --> 20:57.289
Without taking anything away from Peter, believe me or nothing, nobody today alive knows

20:57.792 --> 21:12.848
one iota of what lou philman knew first of all he was a very good friend with some of the finest collectors ned diamond

21:13.081 --> 21:15.043
How did he spell that?

21:15.824 --> 21:16.124
G-U-Y-M-O-N.

21:16.184 --> 21:20.249
He left his whole collection to Occidental College.

21:20.629 --> 21:25.014
He knew Ellery Queen intimately, a pair of them.

21:25.034 --> 21:28.858
Ellery Queen, one of his two guys, Manfred Lee and Fred Danay.

21:29.158 --> 21:30.600
Fred Danay was the book collector.

21:31.781 --> 21:35.225
And Fred Danay was a serious detective fiction.

21:35.245 --> 21:37.007
One of my chapters is writers who collect.

21:37.488 --> 21:38.869
Fred Danay is a great one.

21:39.423 --> 21:48.235
And in fact, he sold his major collection to Lou Feldman, who sold it to Harry Ransom.

21:49.577 --> 21:53.382
So that the University of Texas has an incredible collection.

21:53.763 --> 21:54.183
Right.

21:55.265 --> 21:57.388
Well, they bought it on block, basically.

21:57.588 --> 22:01.173
Ninety-nine percent of it on block from Lou Feldman.

22:01.193 --> 22:02.735
They don't buy detective fiction anymore.

22:02.755 --> 22:05.479
You couldn't sell a piece of detective fiction if you liked detective fiction.

22:06.480 --> 22:08.603
They bought the Ellery Queen collection

22:09.342 --> 22:12.065
And I have a little pamphlet that was done when I bought the collection.

22:12.085 --> 22:13.626
I'll show you that pamphlet.

22:13.646 --> 22:14.447
We've got to get together.

22:14.467 --> 22:18.511
Yeah, I'll show you that pamphlet and remind me that I need to do one or two things.

22:20.953 --> 22:22.835
Yeah, we'll show pamphlets.

22:24.877 --> 22:25.798
Okay, go ahead.

22:25.858 --> 22:26.839
Let's get back to Lou again.

22:26.879 --> 22:29.661
And go get some more food, by the way.

22:29.982 --> 22:31.823
Don't worry.

22:31.903 --> 22:32.444
Huh?

22:32.544 --> 22:33.625
Okay.

22:33.645 --> 22:35.287
And we'll show pamphlets.

22:35.307 --> 22:38.910
Now, later on in years, while I was buying...

22:39.599 --> 22:47.628
Unbeknownst to me, there was a fellow named Rollin Hadley, H-A-D-L-E-Y.

22:48.088 --> 22:50.291
R-O-L-L-L-I-N.

22:50.311 --> 22:51.452
He's one of my best friends.

22:51.492 --> 22:52.673
His nickname is Bump.

22:52.693 --> 22:55.156
He used to be a baseball player called Bump Hadley.

22:57.098 --> 23:03.104
He's a member of the Gloria Club, was a member of the Chavern Club in Boston, the club of our volumes.

23:03.124 --> 23:06.588
And he was the son-in-law of Arthur Houghton.

23:06.608 --> 23:07.269
Really?

23:07.289 --> 23:07.429
Okay?

23:07.865 --> 23:12.171
Arthur Houghton was one of the greatest... He was.

23:12.191 --> 23:13.212
He's divorced.

23:13.613 --> 23:14.654
From his life.

23:14.934 --> 23:16.877
I want to talk to Arthur Houghton.

23:16.897 --> 23:18.099
He's still alive.

23:18.119 --> 23:18.299
Oh, yeah.

23:19.581 --> 23:29.013
That guy probably made more money than any book dealer alive by the purchase of one manuscript, Shahneman, which is a Persian manuscript.

23:29.694 --> 23:30.655
And he sold it off.

23:30.776 --> 23:32.518
He still has most of it, I believe.

23:32.538 --> 23:33.699
I'm not sure.

23:33.760 --> 23:35.502
He sold off most of his collection.

23:35.522 --> 23:36.403
And that's why he's a

23:42.627 --> 23:49.540
I'm sure that's true.

23:49.801 --> 23:58.136
I would say that's true.

23:58.237 --> 24:03.707
Ed said,

24:10.673 --> 24:12.636
He said, because it certainly wasn't because of the money.

24:12.756 --> 24:14.058
He didn't need the money.

24:14.318 --> 24:14.539
Right.

24:15.080 --> 24:16.321
He was pointing glass.

24:16.582 --> 24:17.463
I know, I know.

24:17.844 --> 24:19.666
I got the whole background.

24:19.686 --> 24:22.591
I'd love some insights into life.

24:22.611 --> 24:23.973
But that I can talk about.

24:24.333 --> 24:26.537
Why didn't he give it to Harvard, for instance?

24:26.777 --> 24:27.338
He did.

24:27.358 --> 24:28.459
He gave some great things.

24:28.499 --> 24:30.062
Well, the Keats collection is the other one.

24:30.082 --> 24:31.704
He gave the money to build the library.

24:31.744 --> 24:33.327
Well, here's his name.

24:33.447 --> 24:33.567
Right.

24:33.587 --> 24:34.749
It's a beautiful little library.

24:34.769 --> 24:35.370
It's wonderful.

24:35.390 --> 24:36.191
He didn't shortchange.

24:36.231 --> 24:37.693
They don't complain, believe me.

24:38.551 --> 24:59.614
but a reasonable person might ask how come he's not a collector anymore well not only that why did he sell it the great many of the great collectors do want to see their collections remain however i think i have a theory for that but i won't do what my tape is wrong because i want you to

25:00.100 --> 25:07.151
Well, maybe I'll even keep it on because it won't even help me focus it when I come to writing.

25:07.171 --> 25:10.897
I just, yesterday, got a copy of a book from Harvard, a beautiful book.

25:10.917 --> 25:12.940
It's facsimiles in the Keats stuff.

25:13.601 --> 25:15.905
The Keats stuff in the manuscript.

25:15.925 --> 25:18.089
Now, this stuff is incredible.

25:18.409 --> 25:20.893
As Helen Bender says in her essay,

25:21.211 --> 25:24.818
As you might say about the Vermeer, you couldn't put a price on it.

25:24.838 --> 25:26.301
How can you put a price on a Vermeer?

25:26.501 --> 25:29.947
I mean, if you can't, how can you put a price on this teach that Vermeer is unique?

25:30.569 --> 25:32.091
How about another one?

25:32.111 --> 25:34.596
How about the previous person?

25:37.310 --> 25:40.754
was invaluable to scholarship.

25:40.774 --> 25:41.936
He said, fine.

25:41.956 --> 25:50.326
I think the stuff that could be replicated, because the collector also produced, and I mean, I've got any number of people saying this.

25:50.346 --> 25:51.928
Dick Manning said this to me yesterday.

25:52.509 --> 25:56.854
You know, they're giving their, he's got two rooms named after him.

25:57.255 --> 26:00.499
He's got the one down in Delaware there.

26:00.631 --> 26:08.263
But the books, as much as he loves them and as much as he physically likes to collect them, you know, they are unique.

26:09.825 --> 26:18.359
In my opinion, Dick Manning would probably sell anything out of the book, even that he's bought recently, if he got the right price.

26:18.599 --> 26:20.482
I do think that.

26:20.502 --> 26:23.026
You think the book is in December?

26:23.667 --> 26:24.829
Absolutely.

26:24.849 --> 26:25.710
Why do you say that?

26:26.095 --> 26:28.838
Because I know of several things that he has bought.

26:28.938 --> 26:32.661
I'll leave it on, but I won't quote you directly.

26:32.801 --> 26:34.042
I say it so it's on there.

26:34.062 --> 26:42.090
So let's say this is off the record, because this would be... Let me pursue it as background, but nothing to attribute to you, okay?

26:42.110 --> 26:45.013
For instance, he has bought several major Sherlockian pieces.

26:46.194 --> 26:51.659
A manuscript and a copy of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, first edition, 1892.

26:52.439 --> 26:55.242
English, first edition, in the dust jacket.

26:55.694 --> 26:58.437
He bought him from a dealer in California, Markheim.

26:59.118 --> 27:13.716
And I happen to know at the Los Angeles Fair, right after he bought the manuscript, Markheim had it in his glass case, priced two to three times what he had just paid for his auction for Dick Manny.

27:13.736 --> 27:19.002
And the arrangement, I'm sure, was Mark said to him, look, hey, if I can get you this much money, wouldn't you sell it?

27:19.252 --> 27:22.715
And I'm sure Dick said, absolutely, if you can get me that amount of money.

27:22.735 --> 27:26.799
Is it possible that maybe he didn't want it that bad?

27:26.819 --> 27:26.879
No.

27:26.899 --> 27:29.942
No, he just, I don't think books are that important to me.

27:30.443 --> 27:32.044
And I'm not knocking him at all.

27:32.545 --> 27:33.746
I only met him once.

27:33.826 --> 27:35.147
I should play this.

27:35.247 --> 27:36.609
I should play this for you.

27:36.749 --> 27:40.412
I should let you hear what he says about that.

27:40.432 --> 27:41.654
This is yesterday's interview.

27:43.015 --> 27:46.238
He did say, however, and I had to pin him down on this,

27:47.078 --> 28:11.500
that i said because he does he said that they do he and his wife buy and when the collection is complete they like to give right yeah and they're very important and he said and you know and i'm not just saying this he said this is a fact and i said well what about the books and he said i said what you're saying then is that let them go out to the next generation of collectors and there's something novel about that i mean uh

28:11.480 --> 28:18.109
Robert Hose said, and they said, well, why not give it to whoever?

28:18.129 --> 28:20.792
And he said, look, where would I be?

28:20.812 --> 28:23.576
You know, I haven't gotten my books if it weren't forever collectors.

28:24.337 --> 28:28.482
And I, as a collector, and you as a collector, have to have some... I appreciate that.

28:28.502 --> 28:30.585
...somebody called... Exactly.

28:31.021 --> 28:33.425
But in Dick's case, he hasn't been collecting books that long.

28:33.485 --> 28:34.006
Seven years.

28:34.026 --> 28:37.150
He just arrived on the scene like a shot because he had so much money to spend.

28:37.170 --> 28:38.392
I've got some very interesting quotes on that.

28:38.412 --> 28:41.337
Seven years ago was when he bought The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.

28:41.357 --> 28:43.140
Yeah, I've got some very interesting quotes on that.

28:43.160 --> 28:54.357
He reaches a stage in his life, an age in his life, acquiring almost mind-boggling, dazzling overnight wealth that a lot to do in.

28:54.377 --> 28:54.497
Right.

28:54.950 --> 28:56.752
Huffington did the same thing.

28:56.772 --> 29:00.216
Huffington didn't become a collector until like he was 50 or 60.

29:00.236 --> 29:01.977
He bought a lot and everything.

29:02.037 --> 29:09.485
He didn't know what the hell he was buying, but he did buy what is now one of the finest.

29:09.605 --> 29:09.906
Great.

29:09.926 --> 29:10.546
That's right.

29:10.807 --> 29:13.129
These are the stories, by the way, that I'm writing.

29:13.229 --> 29:14.070
Does this sound like fun?

29:14.410 --> 29:18.815
It's absolutely wonderful.

29:19.035 --> 29:20.297
It's a great interest.

29:21.278 --> 29:23.640
And I'm telling them a story as well.

29:24.295 --> 29:26.060
But see, I started just the opposite.

29:26.160 --> 29:30.451
I started with a very small amount of money.

29:30.471 --> 29:33.659
I still don't have a lot of money.

29:33.679 --> 29:39.695
But I started with Zilch, with one of the best book dealers in the world.

29:40.336 --> 29:41.359
That was Louie.

29:41.727 --> 29:46.774
And that's why I have such fond memories of him.

29:47.234 --> 29:50.258
And I'll remember the name of the dog, too, because I remember the dog.

29:50.318 --> 29:53.823
I can see her sitting right here, okay?

29:54.203 --> 29:57.548
And I'll remember the name of it.

29:57.888 --> 30:06.199
But where Dick started collecting when he had money, so that anything he wanted, he could buy, if it was available.

30:07.281 --> 30:11.346
I started collecting when I had no money, and I really had a hunt for everything.

30:11.900 --> 30:16.226
So I'd go down to Fort Avenue, I'd do all the bookshops.

30:16.346 --> 30:24.518
So what's defined at this point, and we'll get back to a look, what's defined at this point your collection, tell me precisely as you can what it is.

30:24.918 --> 30:26.961
For years, I bought everything.

30:26.981 --> 30:29.625
Anything that appealed to me.

30:30.045 --> 30:41.822
Whether it was a rare edition of Dommier with color lithographs, perhaps the only known copy in the original corp binding folio that he did,

30:42.241 --> 30:52.537
or whether it was an early ecclesiastical work, or it was 18th century American influence, or whether it was very medical influence, or works on books.

30:53.158 --> 30:57.444
I mean, I bought anything that was good, I bought.

30:57.464 --> 31:00.469
My definition of good.

31:00.770 --> 31:02.052
She was overwhelmed.

31:02.092 --> 31:03.413
I mean, I had books.

31:03.914 --> 31:04.815
I still have books.

31:04.835 --> 31:07.138
I mean, there are hundreds and hundreds of boxes of books.

31:08.019 --> 31:13.125
I don't want to get into personal life, but is this something that might maybe cause friction in the household?

31:13.185 --> 31:14.747
Well, it really didn't.

31:14.767 --> 31:16.369
It was just an overwhelming thing.

31:16.509 --> 31:27.282
For instance, now, where Pursua and I live, I have... I mean, it is interesting that you, you know, are now involved with what the woman was... Exactly.

31:27.302 --> 31:28.684
It was the first time in my life.

31:29.137 --> 31:33.983
I've ever been romantically involved with the book deal.

31:34.003 --> 31:34.123
Right?

31:34.143 --> 31:35.184
That's a great story.

31:36.386 --> 31:41.512
So now... Also, I have some knowledge of the book world.

31:41.612 --> 31:49.842
Obviously, after 40 years of buying rare books, it's safe to say that there are many areas that I know of a lot more than Priscilla would ever know about.

31:49.922 --> 31:53.907
Would you describe this as a synergistic relationship, in a way?

31:54.107 --> 31:55.088
I'll give you a good example.

31:55.369 --> 31:58.232
About four months ago,

31:58.550 --> 32:04.097
I was at a book deal with a friend of mine in Cambridge.

32:04.237 --> 32:08.682
And I discovered... I can't tell you.

32:08.782 --> 32:09.543
And you'll see why.

32:09.844 --> 32:18.354
And what I discovered was he had a little work in parts by Harriet Beecher Stowe called The Minister's Wooing.

32:18.374 --> 32:19.976
That's one of her most common titles.

32:23.100 --> 32:24.501
But I liked it.

32:25.362 --> 32:27.545
The parts were immaculate.

32:27.565 --> 32:28.506
And Priscilla brought it there.

32:28.925 --> 32:33.151
Last night, it was here in the window.

32:33.171 --> 32:38.499
Shortly thereafter, I met a friend of Priscilla's who was in the Gloria Club.

32:38.519 --> 32:39.180
Two months later.

32:39.681 --> 32:41.103
She collects Harriet Beecher Stone.

32:41.404 --> 32:42.365
Who knew?

32:42.385 --> 32:44.328
I bought it because it was wonderful.

32:44.649 --> 32:46.011
I couldn't resist it.

32:46.091 --> 32:48.134
Well, let me tell you the story.

32:48.655 --> 32:50.277
I don't collect Harriet Beecher Stone.

32:50.838 --> 32:52.300
I bought it because it was wonderful.

32:52.516 --> 32:56.001
Now, my collecting has now taken on a much more focused approach.

32:56.622 --> 32:57.283
That's today.

32:57.563 --> 33:01.009
I still have hundreds and hundreds of boxes of books.

33:01.209 --> 33:01.990
Boxes?

33:02.010 --> 33:02.451
Boxes.

33:02.471 --> 33:06.837
Casey and Hayes, which is a moving company in Massachusetts, you know, right?

33:06.857 --> 33:07.338
Like this.

33:08.319 --> 33:17.653
And Steve Jovellis, my friend and Priscilla's father, has him stored many of them at United Walden at his plant.

33:17.673 --> 33:20.818
And usually on a Saturday morning, we'll go and we'll unpack

33:21.068 --> 33:41.322
50 boxes and put them up on shelves and he's a record for me just so you can go so we can sort through them and i'll find an art book and i'll say steve would you like to have this now are you sorting these to reacquaint yourself with what you have to enjoy both and also to try and figure out someday to get rid of 90 percent of it which i don't want

33:41.825 --> 33:49.534
My collection is now focused on Detective Fiction, the greatest things in Detective Fiction, and Sherlock Holmes and Doyle.

33:49.594 --> 33:56.323
So if you come to our place, you'll see the walls lying with Doyle and Detective Fiction.

33:56.343 --> 33:59.767
These are some of the... Give me a number.

34:00.468 --> 34:01.869
How many items?

34:02.350 --> 34:02.831
In the house?

34:03.672 --> 34:04.032
Total?

34:04.252 --> 34:07.536
Of this now focused collection?

34:07.556 --> 34:10.600
Of this now focused collection, I'd say maybe 2,000 items.

34:10.833 --> 34:25.734
In any case, I went to this book dealer and I just couldn't resist.

34:25.954 --> 34:29.179
When you're a real book person like me, you've been buying it for 40 years,

34:29.564 --> 34:34.570
If you see a really neat book, then you know that it's virtually unique.

34:35.211 --> 34:36.853
It's very hard to pass out with.

34:36.913 --> 34:46.346
I don't feel like I had to go either, but three years ago, five years ago, down on the Cape, where my family owns a place, my wife and I. Remember Winston Burrell?

34:46.406 --> 34:48.889
They went into old Winston Burrell, who's now dead.

34:48.969 --> 34:50.171
Really, I knew who he was.

34:50.211 --> 34:56.759
He took a grateful book for five seconds, and he assumed his purpose, and he said it's much better.

34:56.779 --> 34:59.082
I saw the pitch if he didn't have...

34:59.365 --> 35:03.050
And he had $1,000 on it.

35:03.270 --> 35:10.099
And let me tell you this story.

35:10.640 --> 35:11.721
I got him down.

35:11.741 --> 35:13.864
I mean, shamelessly.

35:13.884 --> 35:16.327
I got him for $400.

35:16.427 --> 35:17.729
And I kept getting him down.

35:17.769 --> 35:21.454
But what I did was I took $400 gold.

35:21.714 --> 35:23.837
I literally put them under his nose.

35:23.817 --> 35:25.839
My wife said, you can't do that.

35:25.859 --> 35:26.780
I said, hey.

35:26.880 --> 35:28.102
I said, I know what's the problem.

35:28.122 --> 35:30.004
He only paid about $7.

35:30.224 --> 35:32.367
This has worked some time.

35:32.387 --> 35:35.871
I said, he took the money to me.

35:35.891 --> 35:38.694
I'm not a school collector.

35:38.854 --> 35:41.377
It's only a one family.

35:42.398 --> 35:44.961
See, now, I wouldn't buy Uncle Tom's cabin.

35:44.981 --> 35:46.002
Not money on it?

35:46.262 --> 35:47.023
$400?

35:47.003 --> 35:59.342
for anything i know that i know that i'm not saying it's not worth it but i will buy items that to me are almost irreplaceable even if you have all of them

35:59.778 --> 36:27.945
wanted you would be hard-pressed to find another copy of this work in the parts I never saw another copy I think the last time a copy came up for auction was 1921 challenged by exactly I gave it to Priscilla only because this woman is a good client of her and she came yesterday and

36:28.398 --> 36:31.803
She took one look at me and she said, I got a habit.

36:32.224 --> 36:33.506
She said, I've never seen this.

36:33.526 --> 36:34.687
I have a stoked collection.

36:35.048 --> 36:35.969
But you know what?

36:35.989 --> 36:38.753
It made me feel wonderful because she is a very nice lady.

36:38.894 --> 36:47.146
She's also the country of getting something into the hands of someone who loves it.

36:47.326 --> 36:47.727
Exactly.

36:47.747 --> 36:48.067
Loves it.

36:48.207 --> 36:49.109
Loves it as a child.

36:49.770 --> 36:51.592
And here's what I told Priscilla.

36:51.632 --> 36:53.916
I'll tell you about the money aspect of it.

36:54.517 --> 36:55.418
I said, Priscilla,

36:55.735 --> 36:57.920
All you have to do is you give me my money back.

36:58.140 --> 36:59.042
I'm very happy.

36:59.082 --> 37:00.405
Can you make a small profit?

37:00.505 --> 37:02.229
I can't say.

37:02.449 --> 37:05.696
Are we off the record?

37:05.716 --> 37:08.462
If you go up... She couldn't beat it.

37:08.797 --> 37:09.859
She had never seen it.

37:10.380 --> 37:12.743
She said she had heard that it existed.

37:12.763 --> 37:14.306
She's a member of the Gloria Club.

37:14.386 --> 37:15.347
What is it?

37:15.608 --> 37:16.950
It's a work in parts.

37:17.270 --> 37:18.452
You know what in parts means?

37:18.512 --> 37:20.055
Little pamphlets.

37:20.496 --> 37:22.379
Usually Dickens comes in parts.

37:22.439 --> 37:24.362
Well, this is the same thing.

37:24.382 --> 37:25.504
She wrote serially.

37:25.524 --> 37:26.645
This is the only one.

37:26.665 --> 37:27.887
Was she writing a serially?

37:27.907 --> 37:28.108
Yes.

37:28.488 --> 37:29.590
She wrote a serially.

37:29.570 --> 37:32.554
and it came out in blue parts.

37:32.594 --> 37:33.495
What are the years?

37:33.515 --> 37:34.096
Is it post?

37:34.196 --> 37:35.518
In the 1860s.

37:35.859 --> 37:37.982
So it's after Uncle Tom.

37:38.082 --> 37:38.923
It's 50 what?

37:39.704 --> 37:41.907
I think it's 1860s, but I could check for you.

37:41.927 --> 37:43.489
I don't even remember the year.

37:43.509 --> 37:45.031
Well, it doesn't understand.

37:45.051 --> 37:49.858
Because most of this stuff that comes after Uncle Tom, and I brought a collection of stuff.

37:49.938 --> 37:50.419
It really is.

37:50.519 --> 37:54.104
As far as collecting the snow is concerned, you've got to get the local car.

37:54.164 --> 37:55.105
Of course.

37:55.205 --> 37:57.629
Everything else goes down in place.

37:57.649 --> 37:59.051
No, that gives down quality.

37:59.071 --> 37:59.391
Right.

37:59.371 --> 38:00.513
Not a good one.

38:00.613 --> 38:01.835
And this is not a good book.

38:02.436 --> 38:04.099
This is an Aussie book.

38:04.160 --> 38:07.085
So neither is Uncle Tom's Cabin.

38:07.145 --> 38:13.697
Well, Uncle Tom's Cabin, though, in all the sort of romantic tale, it has some very interesting moments.

38:13.857 --> 38:15.540
You know what I brought last night here?

38:15.640 --> 38:17.363
I will confess it to you.

38:17.798 --> 38:23.370
And only because it's a target of opportunity.

38:23.510 --> 38:27.178
And I do have a chapter of who collects the hateful things.

38:27.399 --> 38:34.795
Somebody has to collect them because one of my pieces is a collector doesn't just collect them quiet and collect them for sure.

38:34.775 --> 39:02.200
He was a great client of Johnson

39:02.180 --> 39:23.530
My point is

39:24.151 --> 39:44.117
bought something he tested he hated he wouldn't even put it in his own collection yeah he said first there's no logic it's an interesting story isn't it very interesting who collects this stuff so what'd you buy whips and change is it signed it was the first american and it's got the most extraordinary

39:45.076 --> 39:55.658
I want to get back to who felt it.

39:55.678 --> 39:56.059
I'm having fun.

39:56.079 --> 39:58.043
Are you enjoying yourself?

39:58.504 --> 40:01.330
This I truly enjoy.

40:01.310 --> 40:22.137
only because you're looking at from a book collector's point of view and i love the book it's the one thread that has run through my life that was given to me by my father at such an early age his library had nothing rare in it but it had everything in it particularly the russian authors

40:22.505 --> 40:30.414
I have a problem right now.

40:31.896 --> 40:41.588
My father's died three years ago.

40:41.628 --> 40:52.140
He left all these

40:52.120 --> 40:58.230
My mother's living, still living in the upper reaches of the Bronx.

40:59.011 --> 41:00.714
And I have to do something with these books.

41:01.555 --> 41:04.340
I can't bear myself to deal with the books.

41:05.521 --> 41:07.124
Because they're exactly the way he left them.

41:07.144 --> 41:12.953
You know, he had a great friend with glass in it, like people did in those days here in New York.

41:13.434 --> 41:14.456
Never wanted to move out.

41:15.557 --> 41:17.200
Lived in the Bronx all their lives.

41:17.770 --> 41:23.798
And it pains me every time I think about having to take those books out and I've got to do something with them.

41:24.149 --> 41:32.438
Many of them are in Hebrew, and Russian, and Yiddish, and German, because these are the languages that he spoke for me and ran in.

41:32.458 --> 41:37.303
But because I have this in my mind about not wanting to get rid of these things, it's been very difficult.

41:37.323 --> 41:42.789
So now three years has gone past, and now finally I'm able to deal with this.

41:42.869 --> 41:45.431
And I'll probably give the whole batch of stuff to Harvard.

41:45.451 --> 41:47.774
You haven't anything to do with it?

41:47.874 --> 41:49.055
Oh, yeah, a ton of years.

41:49.195 --> 41:51.178
You know where to give it to?

41:51.198 --> 41:51.658
You know Aaron Lansley?

41:51.638 --> 41:53.684
I'm writing a chapter by Aaron Lansky.

41:53.704 --> 42:00.906
Aaron Lansky is a 34-year-old kid out in Northampton who is on a sacred mission to save the Yiddish language.

42:01.426 --> 42:03.088
and he has a MacArthur grant.

42:03.208 --> 42:07.973
He's got the only book collector I know of to get a genius grant.

42:08.033 --> 42:10.276
And his deal is he will not pay for books.

42:10.356 --> 42:11.337
Tell him to call me out.

42:11.357 --> 42:11.837
He's gone.

42:12.078 --> 42:13.219
He's got like an ambulance.

42:13.399 --> 42:16.763
He goes with this two-and-a-half-ton truck to rescue books from dumpsters.

42:16.823 --> 42:18.124
And he's stuck.

42:18.144 --> 42:20.286
It is a wonderful chapter.

42:20.387 --> 42:22.329
So you're only dealing with millions.

42:22.489 --> 42:24.531
I said, I'm not dealing with them.

42:24.511 --> 42:29.398
But Aaron Lansky is threatening bankruptcy every month.

42:29.458 --> 42:33.323
He's got 900,000 books in a warehouse in Ohio.

42:33.683 --> 42:36.767
He just sold 10,000 books to Yale.

42:37.468 --> 42:42.936
He is now personally responsible for getting unit programs established in 30 colleges and universities.

42:42.956 --> 42:43.677
Is that a good chapter?

42:43.697 --> 42:44.498
That's wonderful.

42:44.518 --> 42:46.240
And this is what I'm doing, by the way.

42:46.400 --> 42:47.582
I'll give him some books.

42:47.562 --> 42:51.875
He comes to New York.

42:51.935 --> 43:00.921
He sends folks everywhere to get close.

43:01.783 --> 43:02.365
His mother...

43:03.037 --> 43:07.624
John Fleming knew him as well as anybody, you know?

43:07.744 --> 43:08.966
John, Lou Feldman.

43:08.986 --> 43:12.031
And John never said an unkind word about him.

43:12.051 --> 43:13.974
He was a real competitor of John's.

43:14.374 --> 43:19.802
And at the end, they were both after the exact same things, the greatest manuscripts, the greatest books.

43:20.283 --> 43:24.009
They were buying exactly the same thing at the end.

43:24.029 --> 43:26.833
Are you familiar with his relationship with Texas?

43:27.269 --> 43:28.091
Very slightly.

43:28.191 --> 43:31.017
I'm not an expert on that area.

43:31.037 --> 43:33.022
I told you I don't even know Harry Ransom.

43:33.042 --> 43:34.966
I've never met Harry Ransom.

43:34.986 --> 43:37.272
And I've been to Texas and I've looked at their collection.

43:38.013 --> 43:39.196
And I'll tell you why.

43:39.236 --> 43:41.481
There's one reason and one reason only.

43:42.035 --> 43:52.568
Because Lou had told me many years ago that he sold, along with the Yellowy Queen collection, to Texas a copy of the Hound of the Baskervilles in a dust jacket.

43:52.729 --> 43:56.493
And to my knowledge, as of today, there is no known copy.

43:56.934 --> 44:00.198
And when I went to Texas, they couldn't find it.

44:00.218 --> 44:02.101
And they said it was stolen.

44:02.121 --> 44:05.245
And from my point of view, I don't believe they ever had it.

44:05.265 --> 44:07.047
And Lou did tell me he sold it.

44:07.067 --> 44:08.008
And I believe him.

44:08.630 --> 44:10.618
But somehow it never got you.

44:10.839 --> 44:13.289
The book is worth $35,000 to $40,000.

44:13.651 --> 44:14.313
What are you telling me?

44:14.333 --> 44:15.137
What happened to it?

44:15.157 --> 44:16.342
I don't know what happened to it.

44:16.362 --> 44:17.205
What do you think happened to it?

44:17.607 --> 44:20.191
I think somebody stole it from the University of Texas.

44:20.872 --> 44:23.055
A collector, anybody, yeah.

44:23.075 --> 44:25.178
You read about the guy they just arrested out in Iowa?

44:25.198 --> 44:26.119
I just read the story.

44:26.399 --> 44:27.641
Where did you read it, by the way?

44:27.841 --> 44:30.165
It was in the Newsday.

44:30.605 --> 44:31.847
You know that paper, Newsday?

44:31.867 --> 44:34.150
I connected with the people in Iowa, by the way.

44:34.190 --> 44:36.153
Let me tell you about the story.

44:36.293 --> 44:38.136
Let's just take a minute.

44:38.276 --> 44:39.538
Priscilla showed me the story.

44:40.660 --> 44:42.222
And I said, I can't believe it.

44:42.262 --> 44:44.305
Ottumwa is in Iowa.

44:44.806 --> 44:46.568
I said, you know who's from Ottumwa?

44:46.801 --> 44:50.849
The only person we know is Radar O'Reilly.

44:53.233 --> 44:55.277
Radar O'Reilly from MASH.

44:55.658 --> 44:57.161
His hometown was Otomo.

44:57.181 --> 44:59.846
He's the only guy I ever heard of.

44:59.886 --> 45:02.491
He's the guy himself from Otomo.

45:02.511 --> 45:03.092
He's from St.

45:03.112 --> 45:04.655
Paul, Minnesota.

45:05.316 --> 45:08.522
I believe personally that he picks this spot because it's

45:08.502 --> 45:12.527
I'm going to go get my coat.

45:12.607 --> 45:20.116
We're going to get together again, right?

45:20.657 --> 45:31.691
We're going to get together again, Nick.

45:31.711 --> 45:35.235
We're going to get together.
