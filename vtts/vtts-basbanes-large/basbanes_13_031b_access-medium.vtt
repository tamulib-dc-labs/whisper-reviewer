WEBVTT

00:02.714 --> 00:04.837
If you'd like, you can sit down there.

00:04.977 --> 00:05.077
Okay.

00:05.097 --> 00:07.400
Why don't you just tell me your name so I can have it on.

00:07.420 --> 00:10.003
So I'll know who I'm talking to when I come to listen to the tape.

00:13.948 --> 00:18.433
Okay.

00:20.115 --> 00:23.159
So we are in the selection office, right?

00:23.459 --> 00:24.400
Right.

00:24.421 --> 00:25.962
And your name is Lolita.

00:25.982 --> 00:27.064
I got that mic.

00:27.244 --> 00:27.304
Oh.

00:27.571 --> 00:30.675
I'm Lolita Silva, and I have been— S-I-L-V-E-R?

00:31.095 --> 00:32.517
No, S-I-L-V-A.

00:32.857 --> 00:33.618
S-I-L-V-A.

00:33.918 --> 00:34.219
Right.

00:34.859 --> 00:35.780
Okay.

00:35.801 --> 00:41.207
And I have been in the office since 1969, April 1969.

00:42.288 --> 00:46.072
Okay, that's a considerable period of time.

00:46.092 --> 00:46.233
Right.

00:46.733 --> 00:55.283
Well, this office was started by my predecessor, Mrs. Metz, in 1947.

00:55.499 --> 00:59.884
She was in the job until she left the library.

01:00.044 --> 01:07.992
So I suspect the people that come to this job must like it, and they just stay.

01:08.012 --> 01:12.157
For fifty years, then, there has been an office that does what?

01:12.577 --> 01:17.582
Basically, we regulate what comes into the library.

01:18.984 --> 01:24.730
Many other people— Okay, Nicholas, this is Merrilee Smith, so— Five minutes, Merrilee.

01:25.368 --> 01:45.728
Okay, first of all, this library, as you know, is so large, our acquisitions are basically on a gargantuan state.

01:46.028 --> 01:48.790
It encompasses the whole world.

01:49.451 --> 01:53.535
And the office was formed, and it's still the function, even so,

01:53.785 --> 02:04.764
we ourselves will not be doing it physically, other people will, is many times books arrive here, they haven't really been pre-selected.

02:04.784 --> 02:06.907
They arrive here automatically.

02:07.669 --> 02:14.861
Like most government documents from almost all countries, also of course from the U.S.

02:14.881 --> 02:19.168
too, state documents.

02:19.688 --> 02:35.453
Through our exchanges, we have piece-by-piece exchange, like the recommending officers deliberately might choose a title, but then we also have exchanges with institutions where they send their publications.

02:35.473 --> 02:47.012
So when the publications come in, traditionally our job has been then at that point to select, also with a copyright deposit.

02:47.313 --> 02:49.297
By selecting to keep?

02:49.317 --> 02:49.998
To keep, yes.

02:50.018 --> 02:53.264
Are you also selecting to not keep?

02:53.284 --> 02:56.089
Yes, keep and discard.

02:56.109 --> 02:57.752
And also how many copies.

02:58.413 --> 03:11.397
Our office has been responsible for the keep-discard decision, which is the first decision, then how many copies to keep of an item, and the priority for cataloging.

03:12.507 --> 03:15.831
So we give directions what items should be catalogued first.

03:15.851 --> 03:20.057
Now, do you have a form that you fill out, or do you do directions on the computer?

03:20.697 --> 03:21.919
No, not on the computer.

03:21.939 --> 03:23.161
That would be impossible.

03:23.181 --> 03:25.744
We handle too many items per day.

03:27.606 --> 03:36.698
The priorities, we use paper slips with numbers on it, like this.

03:36.778 --> 03:38.380
Sure, I can give you a clue.

03:38.630 --> 03:45.759
not the number one, because that's a reserve for... Okay, no, I understand.

03:45.779 --> 03:45.879
Okay.

03:45.899 --> 03:46.600
Anyway, if you want.

03:46.680 --> 03:47.181
Okay, good.

03:48.443 --> 03:51.306
And... Well, this is great.

03:52.728 --> 03:55.452
So, with these slips, you can do what?

03:55.472 --> 04:05.565
You can... Well, this gives direction to the catalogers what items they should be doing first, and also, it's

04:06.018 --> 04:13.129
It's used as a routing slip because there are very many cataloging divisions, so where the item goes.

04:13.349 --> 04:16.394
So there are how many categories?

04:16.434 --> 04:18.156
Divisions?

04:18.797 --> 04:23.545
I think divisions, there are four, and teams, there are like 40 teams.

04:24.145 --> 04:26.329
They're divided by subjects.

04:26.349 --> 04:33.139
And how many items a day would you say you deal with, or in a week?

04:33.845 --> 04:39.393
Well, many items we see more than once because of the way the workflow is, especially with U.S.

04:39.513 --> 04:41.215
publications.

04:41.576 --> 04:52.491
We're responsible for all trade, basically, books that come into the library that's in the book trade.

04:53.993 --> 04:59.681
So our sources are copyright and cataloging in publication office.

04:59.701 --> 05:03.666
Because we provide cataloging, the publisher sends us a copy of the book

05:04.372 --> 05:07.916
So we tend, basically, many times it's the same item.

05:08.116 --> 05:15.183
We tend to see many times the same item more than once because it comes in from different sources.

05:15.564 --> 05:20.109
But I mean, I'm just thinking, do you have help doing this or do you do this by yourself?

05:20.129 --> 05:23.172
No, I, right now we are two people that are doing it.

05:23.252 --> 05:33.703
But this office always has been small because it's, we don't really, we don't have to, what happens with experience,

05:34.240 --> 05:44.049
is that you can look at something and basically, if you see the publisher on the spine, you see the title, you know what you're going to do with it.

05:44.269 --> 05:48.093
In your mind, it just goes by category.

05:48.914 --> 06:00.805
What takes longer is the ephemera, because there you actually have to sometimes read a little bit in it and decide what to do.

06:01.392 --> 06:07.861
With the books that are basically like bookstore books, the decision process is very fast.

06:07.881 --> 06:10.385
And I'll ask no more questions because I think we have to go more.

06:10.405 --> 06:10.545
Right.

06:10.565 --> 06:13.649
Like those children's books over there, those bathtub books.

06:13.669 --> 06:14.390
Yes.

06:14.430 --> 06:18.716
What's going to happen to them as cute as they are?

06:18.736 --> 06:20.158
The pop-up books?

06:20.178 --> 06:21.360
The pop-up books we keep.

06:21.560 --> 06:27.008
We have a collection in the Children's Literature Center of the pop-up books.

06:27.088 --> 06:29.391
What you see also on exhibit here is

06:29.911 --> 06:31.132
Our second copy.

06:32.594 --> 06:34.336
We have all those in our collection.

06:34.536 --> 06:38.881
Actually, I collect pop-up books, and they are really very—I love them.

06:38.901 --> 06:39.701
Oh, I do, too.

06:40.462 --> 06:41.604
They're a pleasure, too.

06:41.624 --> 06:42.925
I heard you think you were going off to the term.

06:42.945 --> 06:43.546
No, they're not.

06:43.846 --> 06:44.867
No, no, no.

06:45.047 --> 06:45.708
Absolutely not.

06:45.728 --> 06:46.449
They're valued.

06:46.649 --> 06:48.171
Where do they go, by the way?

06:48.371 --> 06:54.197
Things that you decide— Okay, well, a lot of— A little bit of a shredder, or what happens?

06:55.088 --> 07:02.958
Well, there probably is a share someplace, but basically we try to exchange all items that are of value to somebody.

07:03.419 --> 07:06.983
So if it is a children's book, it will go into our exchange.

07:09.687 --> 07:11.509
Schools, for instance, can come here.

07:11.549 --> 07:17.417
Representatives, through their congressmen, they can come here and get books.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.378
Can they do that?

07:18.398 --> 07:20.881
Some, yes.

07:20.901 --> 07:23.264
But these books aren't sent to Atlanta?

07:23.284 --> 07:23.965
No, no.

07:24.147 --> 07:24.808
Oh, no.

07:24.828 --> 07:28.112
I was in San Francisco last weekend.

07:28.312 --> 07:29.613
They had 200,000 books.

07:30.134 --> 07:46.093
No, and also, well, some items probably do end up there, but we also deal, because of our copyright office, we deal, you know, with anything can be copyrighted, as long as it has print on us, practically.

07:46.113 --> 07:46.934
You must know that.

07:47.034 --> 07:52.180
So perhaps some of those secondary items, you know, would provide...

07:53.088 --> 07:54.609
for the landfill.

07:54.629 --> 08:07.921
But books, we have a very active exchange program in exchanging gifts, and they will try and exchange the books for items we need.

08:09.683 --> 08:10.404
So they're used.

08:12.546 --> 08:13.226
I have to run.

08:13.246 --> 08:14.387
I'm sorry.

08:15.969 --> 08:16.829
Once more, please.

08:16.970 --> 08:20.833
You say 200,000 items passed through your hands.

08:21.303 --> 08:24.347
So there's a copy—200,000 that has entered the collection volumes?

08:24.367 --> 08:34.619
Well, probably more copies of our hands, but approximately 200,000 volumes are added to the collections on an annual basis.

08:34.639 --> 08:37.242
And they all first come through this office?

08:37.442 --> 08:38.123
Not all.

08:38.603 --> 08:43.729
I would say about three-fourths—well, I'm not sure about how many.

08:44.370 --> 08:47.614
Let's say maybe 150,000 or something.

08:48.303 --> 08:54.270
Because we don't handle material in Chinese, Japanese, or Hebrew, because we can't read it.

08:54.370 --> 09:04.262
But we do in all European languages, and in Russian and Slavic languages, and also Greek.

09:05.003 --> 09:05.864
Do you read all these languages?

09:07.085 --> 09:08.787
Enough to make a decision, yes.

09:11.431 --> 09:16.757
Well, I started out basically with Russian, German, French.

09:16.940 --> 09:26.231
I took Spanish while I was here, and Italian, and the other ones you sort of pick up enough.

09:26.312 --> 09:28.594
We have a wall of dictionaries right there.

09:28.634 --> 09:34.662
Is your background in librarianship?

09:34.982 --> 09:43.673
Well, I actually did—yes, I have a degree in library science, but I studied languages in college and international sphere.

09:46.488 --> 09:50.274
And then I ended up going to library school.

09:50.314 --> 09:51.777
Where did you go to library school?

09:51.797 --> 09:52.378
Columbia.

09:53.459 --> 09:55.282
So they lamented Columbia?

09:55.423 --> 09:57.125
Lamented Columbia Library School.

09:57.145 --> 09:58.347
They don't have it anymore.

09:58.388 --> 09:59.349
They needed the space.

10:00.271 --> 10:02.715
Well, they said it wasn't making enough money for them.

10:02.735 --> 10:03.997
That was probably true.

10:05.720 --> 10:08.965
The University of Chicago has ended its program.

10:08.985 --> 10:12.090
And Berkeley is no longer teaching library skills.

10:12.492 --> 10:27.433
It doesn't permeate coated supercalendar paper very effectively.

10:28.395 --> 10:33.923
It will, in fact, benefit coated supercalendar paper, but you'll get more of the chemistry on the surface.

10:34.724 --> 10:39.090
And then you may end up with a residual powdery coating on the paper that's undesirable.

10:39.880 --> 10:46.168
I know at least one institution, in spite of that, that's treating coded materials because they know that it does some good.

10:46.188 --> 10:47.870
So the Library of Congress has chosen not to.

10:48.951 --> 11:02.308
So we're sending books essentially with what you might view as standard book papers, wood ground, ground wood paper, traditional, for the most part, hard bound books.

11:02.408 --> 11:05.092
So they treated some paperback books for us.

11:05.272 --> 11:06.934
But mostly we're sending traditional

11:07.825 --> 11:14.772
from our general collections and from some special collections within the library?

11:15.693 --> 11:20.078
We have 117 million or so books.

11:20.438 --> 11:22.240
We have about 17 million books.

11:22.260 --> 11:24.502
17 million books in the library.

11:24.522 --> 11:25.323
17 million.

11:26.104 --> 11:31.790
So in a perfect world, all 17 million would be subjected to this?

11:31.850 --> 11:34.693
No, in a perfect world, 17 million books.

11:35.062 --> 11:38.586
shouldn't be subjected to any treatment, in my view, for several reasons.

11:40.108 --> 11:58.228
Whereas, perhaps, Dr. Shahani would say about 90% of these books are probably acidic, if anyone would guess what percentage of them are already so acidic that you could characterize them as being embrittled.

11:58.608 --> 12:00.090
If a book is so brittle

12:01.083 --> 12:07.251
that it can't safely be handled more than a few times, then it's really not a very good candidate for deassociation.

12:07.291 --> 12:20.567
If the paper in a book is so unbridled, and you're familiar with brittle paper, I'm sure, it's really a candidate for reformatting, such as microfilming, or perhaps in the future for digitization.

12:20.587 --> 12:21.228
Whichever.

12:21.708 --> 12:27.295
Whichever, depending on which side of the debate about whether digitization is a preservation activity or not.

12:27.315 --> 12:29.638
That's not a debate you're on for.

12:29.838 --> 12:44.400
There are a lot of recently acquired books in the Library of Congress and in other libraries, of course, especially since about the 1970s to the present, which are published on alkaline papers, alkaline or permanent papers.

12:44.420 --> 12:52.071
So a lot of books that we screen, we actually handle and examine books individually to see whether they're good candidates for deacidification or not.

12:52.211 --> 12:56.217
A lot of books that we handle are brittle.

12:57.614 --> 13:00.838
A lot of books that we handle are duplicates.

13:00.858 --> 13:06.666
We don't spend money via the divine two copies of the same book or the same title of the same book.

13:06.686 --> 13:09.550
So we make discriminating decisions like that.

13:09.570 --> 13:12.974
A lot of the books that we handle are on alkaline paper.

13:12.994 --> 13:16.018
We use pH pens and test books.

13:16.038 --> 13:18.762
If there's a fairly recent book, you see this is alkaline.

13:18.782 --> 13:20.444
You see the purple results here.

13:21.345 --> 13:23.728
Oh, this is acidic.

13:23.748 --> 13:25.731
So if you do this on something that's acidic,

13:26.504 --> 13:29.548
It's been deacidified, by the way.

13:29.568 --> 13:31.190
And something that's acidic, it's yellow.

13:32.231 --> 13:42.625
If you do it on... But this is coated paper, which has clay coating on the surface, which is alkaline.

13:42.925 --> 13:52.778
And a lot of modern book papers, especially in publications in developed countries like the United States and Western Europe, are already being produced today on alkaline paper.

13:53.679 --> 13:55.802
So there's no need for us to deacidify them.

13:56.508 --> 14:13.513
The Library of Congress, however, probably over sixty percent of our acquisitions are from foreign countries, and a large percentage of the foreign acquisitions that we obtain are from not fully developed countries, which still produce acidic paper.

14:14.635 --> 14:17.379
So we're still acquiring a large quantity of acidic books.

14:18.300 --> 14:24.810
Is that seventeen million figures, is that for the books that are in the general collections and law only?

14:25.617 --> 14:27.500
I'm not sure.

14:27.520 --> 14:33.087
I think it's a total book count for the library, but I'm not sure.

14:33.107 --> 14:36.592
What's the cost to the library to do a book?

14:37.673 --> 14:41.478
Under our current contract, it's a little over eleven dollars.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.863
The current contract is eleven.

14:45.584 --> 14:48.047
I think we're paying eleven dollars and sixty-nine cents a book.

14:49.900 --> 15:06.261
Compared to letting a book get brittle enough and then reformatting it at today's prices, I mean, we're paying an average of about, ahead of our reformatting office, there's about $935 to reformat a book.

15:06.281 --> 15:12.829
So if we avoided deacidifying this book, if we had avoided deacidifying this book 20 years ago, it became totally brittle.

15:13.750 --> 15:17.815
Instead of spending $11 or $12 to deacidify it,

15:18.757 --> 15:25.026
We decided, you know, as a candidate 20 years later for reformatting, we might spend ten times as much to reformat it.

15:25.046 --> 15:30.995
So at the moment, it's in your—it behooves you to follow this route.

15:31.956 --> 15:32.557
To do both.

15:32.677 --> 15:36.743
I mean, there's so many books in both categories—in a number of categories.

15:36.803 --> 15:45.996
That's why we make discriminating preservation decisions and send some books for repair, some books for rebinding and binding repair, some books for reformatting.

15:46.651 --> 15:53.603
some of the more valuable books to professional conservators for professional attention, and some books for deacidification.

15:53.724 --> 15:57.671
But I mean, David Bradbury tells me it's a British library.

15:57.691 --> 16:03.000
It would cost a billion pounds to build this brand-new library.

16:03.621 --> 16:10.313
And it's been estimated if we were going to convert every book that we own, you know,

16:10.664 --> 16:13.849
that would cost us at least fifty billion pounds."

16:13.869 --> 16:16.394
To reformat everything?

16:16.414 --> 16:17.956
Yeah, right.

16:18.598 --> 16:21.543
So that's never going to happen.

16:21.563 --> 16:36.368
You know, the fact is, the books are here for, you know, anyone who thinks that this is—and labor prices are pretty, you know, you might say that the cost of the process might come down, or it will cost you $11.69 a book.

16:36.770 --> 16:40.417
That might come down, but there's still a lot of labor involved, and that's not going to come down.

16:40.537 --> 16:53.683
Well, we might, you know, we can't sit here and say ten years from now we might be doing quantities that are five or ten times what we're doing now, and the cost might come way down, but you're still going to be spending a lot more dollars.

16:54.063 --> 16:56.989
Everything's relative.

16:57.998 --> 17:04.104
Everything that's done in a cultural institution is expensive, but it's expensive to preserve the information and the objects as well.

17:04.665 --> 17:09.250
So, I mean, sometimes you make a decision to preserve information, such as in reformatting.

17:09.270 --> 17:18.700
Sometimes you're making a decision to preserve both the object and the information, such as in professional conservation or in deacidification.

17:18.720 --> 17:25.727
So, and everything, every option that you can exercise has a sort of cost attached to it.

17:25.842 --> 17:30.730
Binding or rebinding repair might cost on average $6 to $9 a book.

17:31.792 --> 17:35.939
Deacidification $10 to $12 a book.

17:35.999 --> 17:43.612
Reformatting $135 to several hundred dollars per book for digitization, depending on what approach you take to it.

17:43.632 --> 17:49.622
What condition the book's in, whether it has a lot of visual images that have to be reformatted in a different way.

17:50.480 --> 18:01.527
and there's a whole range of options and a range of prizes, and you have to have professional people exercise good judgment in deciding what to do with different parts of the collection.

18:01.547 --> 18:06.058
Are you pretty much limited now by the capacity of the...

18:07.878 --> 18:15.026
the company that's doing this for you to do it, or by the budget, by the amount of dollars that you have available?

18:15.347 --> 18:16.008
It's hard to say.

18:16.028 --> 18:24.377
Well, at the present time, I would say we're constrained pretty much by the budget exigences, the amount of funds that we have for this activity.

18:24.478 --> 18:29.143
If you had enough money to do 200,000 books, do you think they could do 200,000 books for you?

18:30.642 --> 18:32.304
Yes, I think they could.

18:32.564 --> 18:34.846
Or other companies.

18:34.946 --> 18:40.591
I mean, one thing the library really looks to is to continue to encourage the development of other processes.

18:40.611 --> 18:42.653
We'd really like to see competition in this field.

18:43.354 --> 18:50.901
Just as we see competition, there's approximately 100 commercial library binders in the United States, various sizes, offering services for libraries.

18:50.941 --> 18:53.023
There's a lot of competition in that field.

18:53.043 --> 18:56.706
It helps hold down the cost of commercial library binding.

18:56.726 --> 18:59.569
We'd like to see some competition in this field in the United States.

19:00.258 --> 19:07.045
That's one reason the library continued to try to develop and perfect its own process while these others were being affected.

19:07.065 --> 19:16.996
We'd also like to see Battelle or some of the other companies that are developing processes in Europe do marketing analysis in the United States and decide to open a plan here.

19:17.717 --> 19:24.865
But they would have to poll library directors and archivists, administrative heads of archivists.

19:25.148 --> 19:30.234
and decides there's enough cumulative interest and real dollars available.

19:31.135 --> 19:50.177
And currently, part of the problem in any kind of emerging technology like this is that the budget situation in multiple institutions in the United States is pretty constrained, and it doesn't really do a lot to encourage the development of it.

19:51.490 --> 19:59.785
Well, this is the Library of Congress, but having been to a number of institutions, I just don't think the money is there for the books.

20:00.527 --> 20:08.221
The money is there for computers and software and digitization, buying journals now online.

20:09.844 --> 20:14.933
I'm wondering if such a company would get the kind of interest

20:16.060 --> 20:19.125
that ought to be there, or that could be there.

20:19.145 --> 20:21.008
I don't want to put a ball of sentiment on it.

20:21.148 --> 20:23.251
It's hard to say.

20:23.332 --> 20:43.063
I mean, in my view, I would suggest that probably for this company or others to make a long-term success out of a mass process like this, the process has to be effective, safe, both to patrons and the environment.

20:44.630 --> 20:47.675
which one of these are big matters.

20:47.695 --> 20:50.419
Much more complicated than they seem on the surface.

20:50.439 --> 20:52.282
But safe and effective.

20:52.783 --> 20:55.307
Non-damaging.

20:56.008 --> 21:00.114
Non-damaging and cost-effective.

21:00.134 --> 21:02.638
So, I don't know what that means.

21:02.658 --> 21:05.703
I don't know what cost-effective means to one library compared to another.

21:05.924 --> 21:11.953
I mean, we may be paying $11, $12 right now and think that

21:12.153 --> 21:13.675
It's fairly reasonable.

21:13.695 --> 21:19.842
Other libraries may be waiting because they want the library for the overall cost to go down compared to other preservation options.

21:19.942 --> 21:20.663
I'm not sure.

21:20.683 --> 21:23.426
Do you work with the newspapers as well?

21:23.586 --> 21:24.808
Is this something you work with?

21:26.490 --> 21:26.550
No.

21:26.570 --> 21:29.173
You mean right now with deacidification?

21:29.193 --> 21:30.795
You don't deacidify them at all.

21:30.815 --> 21:31.175
We're not.

21:31.195 --> 21:31.936
They can be.

21:31.956 --> 21:34.159
And they certainly are by other institutions.

21:34.279 --> 21:39.325
And, for example, the National Library of Austria has a separate process that it uses.

21:40.233 --> 21:57.103
I don't know, there are various options.

21:57.143 --> 21:59.467
They may bind them.

21:59.968 --> 22:03.574
A lot of institutions microfilm newspaper collections.

22:05.157 --> 22:09.783
so that they can have a record set of all the information.

22:09.863 --> 22:17.392
As I suggested, the Austrian National Library deacidifies their valuable newspaper collections.

22:17.412 --> 22:22.118
This process and others could conceivably be used to deacidify newspapers.

22:22.258 --> 22:34.573
And then real valuable rare newspaper collections, of course, can be, and I'm sure on some scale, are deacidified in various institutions by professional conservators in a laboratory setting.

22:35.347 --> 22:42.616
So you can also take valuable copies of old newspapers, and conservators can deacidify them in a fume hood in a laboratory setting.

22:42.636 --> 22:52.348
It's much more expensive, but I've seen old newspapers deacidified that way, a single copy at a time, being sprayed in a laboratory or something.

22:52.368 --> 22:56.693
And what other programs are you involved in, or is this largely the most?

22:58.395 --> 23:02.620
It's the main activity I'm involved in right now.

23:03.308 --> 23:10.943
of the major contractual procurement activities of the Preservation Directive.

23:10.963 --> 23:16.614
And how much money do you have to spend on preservation right now, approximately?

23:16.634 --> 23:18.378
I can't speak to that.

23:18.498 --> 23:23.528
You'd have to ask .

23:25.313 --> 23:26.294
Is that pretty much it?

23:26.334 --> 23:27.555
Do we cover it, do you think?

23:27.936 --> 23:28.536
I think so.

23:28.616 --> 23:37.605
I think if you're going to visit the other institutions like France and Germany, I could tell you things that are on my own, some of which would be apocryphal, I suppose.

23:37.645 --> 23:42.010
Probably best for them to speak for themselves, but there are a lot of important activities going on.

23:42.150 --> 23:43.712
Well, for instance, what should I be looking for?

23:44.212 --> 23:52.080
And this is not to be quoted on, but just to help me in my—I'm a neophyte in this.

23:53.005 --> 24:08.488
National Library is trying to develop, is in fact, has contracted with a corporation in France to develop a process that both deacidifies on a mass scale and strengthens paper.

24:09.469 --> 24:12.674
There haven't been any announcements that I know over the past year and a half.

24:12.694 --> 24:16.580
It's under development and they're not saying anything publicly.

24:16.820 --> 24:18.743
You didn't tell me anything when I was there.

24:19.263 --> 24:19.644
They didn't.

24:19.664 --> 24:25.812
They were very closed-mouthed about things like this until they were fully involved.

24:26.734 --> 24:30.919
Well, they learned a lot from the library's experience in Africa.

24:30.939 --> 24:31.160
I suppose.

24:31.220 --> 24:31.721
And their own.

24:31.821 --> 24:39.131
I mean, they had another process earlier that wasn't entirely successful, and I think Trumpeted a lot about it and probably learned a lot.

24:39.511 --> 24:42.756
Any time any federal agency or government agency

24:43.225 --> 24:49.392
it announces its intentions to do something, people think it's failed because it isn't done the next day.

24:50.834 --> 24:54.598
So it's better to keep it quiet while it's under development so there's no pressure.

24:55.579 --> 25:06.432
And the German Deutsche Bibliothek, as you know, in Frankfurt, working with their

25:08.082 --> 25:13.929
the most big field library in Leipzig was developed as work with Battelle to develop the other process.

25:13.949 --> 25:17.513
That's basically done on contract between the German government and the Battelle company.

25:18.113 --> 25:24.040
Interestingly, an American company in Germany that's developed another— That company is what?

25:24.640 --> 25:25.141
Battelle.

25:25.161 --> 25:27.123
B-A-T-T-E-L-L-E.

25:27.624 --> 25:28.805
That's an American company?

25:28.825 --> 25:32.629
Well, I think the main headquarters of Battelle International is headquartered in Ohio.

25:33.911 --> 25:37.735
So I think my understanding is that the branch of

25:38.086 --> 25:43.172
Mattel that they're working with is a German— So why are they pioneering this over here?

25:43.192 --> 25:52.623
Well, it is not Mattel, because the German National Library or the Cultural Ministry had money to try to develop this technology in Germany.

25:52.643 --> 25:57.648
So they contracted with Mattel in Germany to develop a lot of processes.

25:57.668 --> 26:00.992
So basically it's an underwritten research project.

26:01.012 --> 26:01.633
Right.

26:01.653 --> 26:02.394
Absolutely.

26:02.414 --> 26:03.715
By the cultural institutions.

26:03.755 --> 26:06.118
Again, by the National Library, basically, in Germany.

26:06.503 --> 26:11.911
So I wonder why they are willing to underwrite something like this and nobody else is.

26:11.931 --> 26:18.079
Well, just like we underwrote the development of the DES process, just like the French are underwriting the development of another process.

26:18.220 --> 26:23.928
It's basically the national libraries and archives that are underwriting the development of most of these processes.

26:23.948 --> 26:24.829
Bookkeeper is different.

26:24.849 --> 26:28.073
It was done by a small company of venture.

26:29.035 --> 26:34.182
The Waitot process basically has not been commercialized, but it was developed for use.

26:34.972 --> 26:39.676
to deacidify books in the Canadian National Library.

26:40.637 --> 26:45.322
The books are actually treated for them by the Canadian National Archives.

26:46.102 --> 26:47.944
It's used to treat books in the library.

26:49.906 --> 27:02.818
The funds for the development and building of the equipment and the utilization of that process were furnished by the Canadian government, not by the way to a company.

27:03.305 --> 27:09.513
contracted with a man who's president of Waiteau and come to Canada and work with their engineers to build equipment.

27:09.533 --> 27:17.804
And they buy chemistry, as I understand it, or they have in the past at least bought chemistry from the Waiteau company to operate the equipment.

27:17.824 --> 27:21.368
But in most of these cases, it's the institution.

27:22.169 --> 27:26.635
As I said, the keeper's an exception, so you might want to talk to them.

27:26.655 --> 27:28.738
It'd be a different experience seeing how

27:28.972 --> 27:34.900
the perspective of the small company getting into a business, whereas most of these processes have been developed by institutions.

27:34.920 --> 27:37.603
Is this the fellow who was written about in the Wall Street Journal?

27:37.683 --> 27:38.504
Right, right.

27:39.285 --> 27:40.066
He sounds very interesting.

27:40.087 --> 27:45.193
Actually, well, Mr. Spat, Dick Spat, is the man that holds the patent.

27:45.213 --> 27:51.962
And if you go to Pittsburgh and meet with him and talk to anyone, you might also want to talk to a man named Jim Bird or James Bird.

27:52.042 --> 27:53.364
He's the president of the company.

27:54.325 --> 27:56.548
B-U-R-D.

27:57.271 --> 28:04.620
But Spatz is the fellow that— Spatz is the CEO, basically the owner of the technology.

28:08.325 --> 28:09.426
Do you like the technology?

28:09.446 --> 28:12.169
Do you prefer it to the one you had out of Texas?

28:15.694 --> 28:20.059
No, I don't know.

28:20.219 --> 28:25.506
There are reasons that you would prefer one technology over the other, I suppose, for different kinds of books.

28:26.330 --> 28:28.552
We prefer it because we can get it.

28:28.572 --> 28:29.554
It's a good technology.

28:29.594 --> 28:35.120
It's the only technology available in the United States, and it's safe and effective.

28:35.220 --> 28:52.759
Another kind of melange of advantages that the bookkeeper process has is that it doesn't cause a variety of damages that other processes cause and have caused, like odors and like

28:53.026 --> 28:58.254
like causing iridescent rings on book covers and like removing labels on the spines of books.

28:58.855 --> 29:09.592
Some of these other chemical processes have damaged book labels, have damaged book covers, have made inks bleed, have induced odors into books.

29:10.333 --> 29:14.580
Bookkeeper does none of these kinds of varieties of damages to books.

29:14.620 --> 29:19.708
Somebody had mentioned something to me there, that the Boston Athenaeum

29:20.245 --> 29:21.386
Oh, God, it's too sketchy.

29:21.426 --> 29:23.248
Somebody told me this in a couple months ago.

29:23.268 --> 29:26.312
They had bought some stuff, I guess, that you put on a book.

29:26.732 --> 29:30.016
They even hired the elevator operator to do it.

29:30.056 --> 29:33.140
I mean, they went with a new elevator and he needed a job.

29:33.300 --> 29:38.265
And they said how the covers were just peeling off.

29:38.906 --> 29:41.950
I don't know what the process was.

29:41.970 --> 29:43.772
If I find out, I'll tell you.

29:44.833 --> 29:46.675
I'll go back to my notes.

29:46.823 --> 29:56.597
I mean, there have been a lot of really kind of, not amusing because of the destruction, but a lot of processes that have really destroyed books have made it worse, I guess.

29:56.698 --> 29:58.440
I suppose.

29:58.460 --> 30:07.814
Sometimes people develop things like that and advertise them as being archival quality and safe and that sort of thing, and they're not really fully tested by reputable institutions.

30:07.834 --> 30:08.815
Sometimes they're just claims.

30:09.016 --> 30:11.920
Well, I think we've covered it.

30:12.507 --> 30:15.730
Do you mind if I call you if there are any other questions?

30:15.770 --> 30:16.611
Not at all, no.

30:16.631 --> 30:17.652
Please feel free to.

30:17.753 --> 30:18.714
I hope this helps.

30:18.914 --> 30:22.878
If you're interested in the brochure, which may have their phone numbers, I'll give you a copy of that.

30:22.898 --> 30:24.480
If you can share that, I'd love it.

30:26.562 --> 30:29.004
You're talking about making collections last.

30:29.064 --> 30:42.058
I think one of the grossest generalizations we can make about deacidification, which we haven't really covered, is the fact that most of these processes, our minimum qualifications, and to the extent that I acknowledge that these other processes

30:42.697 --> 30:48.449
One of the things that we require is that any mass utilization process extend the life of a book by a minimum of 300%.

30:48.509 --> 30:59.592
And, in fact, the bookkeeper process, the DES process, some other processes we've evaluated and tested in recent years, in fact, extend the life of a book.

30:59.612 --> 31:02.899
Dr. Shahani estimates 500 to 800%.

31:03.706 --> 31:11.016
So if a book would have a normal life left in it of only fifty years, it might extend its life to two hundred to three hundred years.

31:11.036 --> 31:31.165
If it had a normal life expectancy of a hundred years, and you deal with it if I had it left alone, stored it in a good environment—I mean, there are some assumptions here—if you store it properly in a good library environment, good temperature and humidity and particular control and that sort of thing, and it's not abused by

31:31.600 --> 31:34.203
staff or patrons in the future.

31:34.223 --> 31:35.504
It's a big assumption.

31:36.405 --> 31:48.256
Say you deacidify a book, you store it in proper conditions and don't abuse it, it should last at least 500% longer than it would if you didn't neutralize the acid area.

31:48.276 --> 31:52.560
The degradation scale kept plummeting and the paper kept getting riddle.

31:53.641 --> 31:56.264
So that's the big advantage of deacidification.

31:56.284 --> 32:00.628
Ideally, in the future, I would like to see us have access to processes of both

32:01.013 --> 32:03.456
neutralize the acid in the paper and strengthen it.

32:04.558 --> 32:10.426
So you'd have the option of deacidifying or strengthening or deacidifying and strengthening, or just strengthening.

32:11.848 --> 32:26.008
Right now, in the French, they're the only ones that are working on a dual process, actually trying to... It would be wonderful, perhaps, in the next decade or two, other entities will develop joint deacidification and strengthening processes.

32:26.028 --> 32:27.891
Is it a breakthrough rumored in France?

32:27.911 --> 32:28.692
Is that...

32:29.768 --> 32:31.550
I haven't heard any of them.

32:31.730 --> 32:39.218
Like you, I haven't heard much at all during the French except one or two brief announcements out of plants about what they're doing.

32:39.238 --> 32:47.767
They're working with a company called Separex, and there was a little blurb in the— I haven't heard anything about it.

32:47.787 --> 32:54.254
—what they call the International Preservation League.

32:54.274 --> 32:56.676
What's the name of the company again?

32:56.797 --> 32:57.177
Separex?

32:58.237 --> 33:02.522
I could probably find you a copy of that little announcement.

33:02.542 --> 33:04.083
I've got just a minute.

33:04.104 --> 33:04.664
I've got one more question.

33:04.784 --> 33:15.416
You've probably figured out by now that by far the most effective and cheapest preservation is proper storage and environment and handling.

33:17.238 --> 33:27.990
And all of the things that, or the two things that I have shown you today, are in the realm of treatment.

33:32.020 --> 33:35.845
rather than prevention.

33:36.546 --> 33:40.371
You were asking about the commitment of the library to preservation.

33:40.451 --> 33:53.769
The commitment is primarily shown through the initiatives it's taken to provide us a stable environment, good handling, appropriate storage.

33:54.289 --> 34:00.778
Where those things are overcome by inherent chemical instability

34:01.720 --> 34:10.436
or poor handling prior to acquisition or physical weakness.

34:11.017 --> 34:25.483
That's when these other technologies that you've been looking at come into play, or when there's a high demand for access, which is part of what's driving—the major thing is driving digitization.

34:27.387 --> 34:31.852
What is the driving of the digitization is the access, you say?

34:34.015 --> 34:34.675
For everyone.

34:41.063 --> 34:47.510
Because when it's digitized, you can flip it up on the internet and immediately the whole world can see it.

34:47.550 --> 34:50.053
That's major access.

34:50.978 --> 35:00.070
You know, one thing, if you could, I'd love to see, and all the times I've been in this building, I've never actually seen books, where you keep books.

35:00.530 --> 35:02.933
Is that something where you just do a fast walk just to see?

35:04.355 --> 35:09.362
That's more difficult than to have a building.

35:09.382 --> 35:11.164
It's no big deal.

35:11.617 --> 35:14.061
We need to arrange a stack pass for you.

35:14.081 --> 35:17.927
How hard would it be to arrange a stack pass for Mr. Vaskin?

35:17.947 --> 35:18.148
Not today.

35:18.168 --> 35:18.749
That's too late.

35:18.769 --> 35:19.991
Well, maybe another time.

35:20.011 --> 35:22.074
You know, the stacks are not open to the public.

35:22.094 --> 35:22.555
That's fine.

35:22.575 --> 35:24.118
It's part of our— That's fine.

35:24.138 --> 35:24.999
Just fine.

35:25.760 --> 35:26.241
No problem.

35:26.261 --> 35:37.881
Here, and they're using this process as what you'd call supercritical fluid to kind of explain—what is here in this paragraph?

35:37.901 --> 35:38.181
Oh, yeah.

35:39.663 --> 35:41.885
Well, you really should see the stacks.

35:41.905 --> 35:42.786
I should, yeah.

35:42.806 --> 35:49.513
Because it gives you better appreciation of the scope of the problem.

35:49.793 --> 35:50.754
One quick question.

35:51.775 --> 35:52.756
Who selects the books?

35:54.498 --> 35:55.839
We have a staff that's trained.

35:56.340 --> 36:02.446
I mean, it includes preservation staff, and they work with a custodial staff in the different divisions in the library.

36:03.547 --> 36:05.670
At the global level?

36:05.690 --> 36:06.651
At the global level.

36:06.691 --> 36:09.113
Oh, at the global level.

36:09.447 --> 36:25.113
So far, there's been a management committee of supervisory and senior librarians that specialize in different divisions in the library, have gotten together and made recommendations to the Associate Librarian of Congress.

36:25.614 --> 36:26.335
Which kind of stuff.

36:26.496 --> 36:28.199
The preservation policy group.

36:28.299 --> 36:33.227
The decisions will be made more before they get to you.

36:33.646 --> 36:39.959
The screen for the authentication is decided by a management team that knows a lot about the collections.

36:39.979 --> 36:40.640
That's important.

36:41.161 --> 36:41.442
Right.

36:41.462 --> 36:42.464
What are you reading?

36:42.484 --> 36:43.025
Thanks for reading.

36:43.045 --> 36:44.067
I'll be in touch, okay?

36:44.107 --> 36:44.949
It's a pleasure.

36:44.969 --> 36:45.651
Yeah, thanks a lot.

36:45.671 --> 36:46.893
See you tomorrow.

36:47.174 --> 36:47.875
Good, thanks.
