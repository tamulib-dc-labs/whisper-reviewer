WEBVTT

00:07.642 --> 00:08.944
This is the Peeps building.

00:08.964 --> 00:09.945
This is the Peeps building.

00:10.946 --> 00:15.272
And can I have your full name, Doctor, so I can just... It's Richard Lockett.

00:15.412 --> 00:17.555
And that's L-U-C-K-E-T-T.

00:18.336 --> 00:20.760
And you are the librarian director?

00:21.200 --> 00:24.344
Thank you, sir.

00:24.364 --> 00:25.266
Thank you.

00:26.708 --> 00:27.409
So, here we are.

00:28.410 --> 00:31.855
You can talk to me a little bit about the library if you'd like.

00:32.676 --> 00:33.717
You said you were going to start.

00:34.270 --> 00:36.953
Oh, no, I only said I thought we'd better start here.

00:37.113 --> 00:37.693
Okay.

00:37.994 --> 00:39.675
Because there's somewhere to sit down.

00:39.695 --> 00:40.936
These are my rooms.

00:42.738 --> 00:45.140
We'll go next door to the library in a few minutes.

00:45.201 --> 00:47.303
But I think it's up to you to ask the question.

00:47.323 --> 00:47.943
Okay.

00:47.963 --> 00:54.990
Well, needless to say that the Peeps Library for me is of great interest.

00:56.511 --> 01:03.298
And it just became even sharpened more yesterday when I went up to Oxford and went to Duke Humphrey's library.

01:03.785 --> 01:10.997
It's a beautiful structure, a beautiful building, but only three of his books are available.

01:11.257 --> 01:16.546
The great point about Beats Library is that there are nobody else's books but his, books of his.

01:16.766 --> 01:24.639
That's one of the threads that runs through my study, is that you do have collectors.

01:25.820 --> 01:29.286
Beats was a collector, book people, book collectors.

01:30.818 --> 01:42.195
who, through whatever, you can call them idiosyncrasies or anything you want, but are, they have been responsible for the preservation of knowledge and things.

01:42.215 --> 01:47.483
And as I understand it, there are unique items in the Peaks Library, is that correct?

01:47.503 --> 01:50.447
Yes, well obviously every manuscript is unique.

01:51.188 --> 02:00.522
But there are a number, a great number of things in which we have what appear to be the only known copies

02:00.974 --> 02:02.756
I never, in fact, say unique.

02:02.776 --> 02:05.219
I always say own and own copy, because... That's good.

02:05.259 --> 02:07.401
I like that phrase.

02:07.542 --> 02:09.344
You never know what may turn up.

02:09.364 --> 02:09.504
Uh-huh.

02:10.465 --> 02:18.955
Well, I know that as a writer, whenever I use the word unique, I say the never before that has happened.

02:18.975 --> 02:25.582
You know, inevitably, someone comes forward to prove you incorrect.

02:25.602 --> 02:26.103
That's the case.

02:26.363 --> 02:27.825
I think I want to...

02:27.991 --> 02:38.363
One wants immediately to qualify the sense in which, or to expand perhaps, the sense in which Pepys could be called a book collector.

02:39.103 --> 02:55.922
He was a collector of books, and I suppose you can also say that he was a bibliophile, but he doesn't at all accord with modern inspirations of bibliography.

02:56.071 --> 02:57.973
And of course, Pepys is three people.

02:59.134 --> 03:03.319
You've got, as it were, to the bottom of the mound.

03:03.339 --> 03:06.202
Most people, I think, stop with Pepys as a diarist.

03:06.482 --> 03:09.786
That's why I'm penetrating to the bottom of the mound.

03:09.806 --> 03:19.296
Though one of the extraordinary things about it, which immediately runs as a kind of thread through the strata, is that the diary is in the library.

03:20.096 --> 03:25.302
And is virtually the only

03:25.855 --> 03:52.504
personal thing in fact it is the only personal thing in the library the only thing of peeps's personal papers went elsewhere in fact most of them were in bodily but the diary he put in the library i'll show you in a moment that's wonderful uh then the second peeps if you take the first peeps who is of course peeps not known to any of his contemporaries in disguise the second peeps uh is peeps a civil servant

03:54.188 --> 03:59.274
which is how he was known to his contemporaries, primarily.

03:59.294 --> 04:14.513
And it was really only the last 12 years of his life that he was thought of chiefly as a virtuoso, because by that time, as a result of his revolution, he had left office.

04:16.195 --> 04:23.824
So, Pepys, the civil servant, the man who invented many of the structures which still govern

04:25.137 --> 04:27.159
and regulated bureaucracy in this country.

04:28.600 --> 04:52.084
The man who actually invented some of the structures which the Lieutenant North Company, post the Secretary of the Navy, was created by Peeps to regularize naval administration in this country, and then taken over after the revolution in sex.

04:52.104 --> 04:55.127
In fact, I once had a visit from John Lemmon,

04:55.647 --> 05:01.495
when he was Secretary of the Navy, he wanted to see what his predecessor had been after.

05:01.555 --> 05:07.202
I thought that was actually a lot of writing.

05:08.184 --> 05:10.226
So that's the second Pepys.

05:10.807 --> 05:17.656
And then the third Pepys is Pepys, the book collector.

05:17.676 --> 05:19.659
The book man, whatever we want to call him.

05:19.799 --> 05:23.764
And yet, as we'll see, his book collective

05:24.622 --> 05:46.630
was a very, very functional thing, and defined within, by certain rigid precepts, which are not those that you'd expect from a book chapter today, or from most pet music books, though perhaps unwittingly he was moving towards

05:47.251 --> 05:52.336
the kind of values that all modern book collecting.

05:52.356 --> 05:57.241
He certainly had a sense of the value of his library.

05:57.601 --> 05:59.583
You don't even have to call it a collection.

05:59.964 --> 06:03.587
When I say I'm writing about book collectors, that is vague.

06:03.747 --> 06:04.668
I'm really not.

06:04.688 --> 06:05.769
No people who collect books.

06:05.809 --> 06:08.132
The trouble is the term has got subverted in a way.

06:08.292 --> 06:13.377
I'm using it really, I'm not writing about book collecting, I'm writing about people.

06:13.981 --> 06:22.229
who have been obsessed even with books, and do you think that Pepys was an obsessive fulfillment of his books?

06:22.249 --> 06:32.518
Certainly, the codicil that set out his library, which is delightful, I certainly have to feel that he took this exceedingly seriously.

06:32.558 --> 06:42.908
He took it very seriously, but he's not obsessive about books in any sense which is distinct from that in which he was

06:43.208 --> 06:46.151
the way in which he was obsessive about other things.

06:46.171 --> 06:46.752
The diary.

06:47.213 --> 06:57.444
I mean, one has to be very cautious of this word, the word obsessive, which I think possibly has stronger connotations in English and English than it does in American English.

06:57.464 --> 06:58.605
Well, Paul Freud certainly.

06:58.866 --> 06:59.146
Yes.

06:59.667 --> 07:11.680
You see, he was all his life concerned with neatness and regularity, with getting things tied up, whether it's his diary in which he

07:12.183 --> 07:22.156
doesn't miss an entry, in which you think about it, he very oddly reports, I'm so glad that he did get to the end of the day.

07:22.297 --> 07:35.895
His diary which is meticulously, and which has continuous run actually, of course not a run to the period in which he was most influential.

07:36.348 --> 07:38.690
that during the time he was making his career.

07:38.710 --> 07:41.793
Do you think that he didn't do it, or that one doesn't exist?

07:41.813 --> 07:43.274
Oh, yeah, that it disappeared.

07:43.314 --> 07:46.937
We know it doesn't exist, because he stopped, because his eyes were failing.

07:46.957 --> 07:48.518
He thought his eyes were failing.

07:48.538 --> 07:51.521
So he stopped and reported that he was stopping?

07:51.581 --> 07:53.342
Yes, of course he stopped.

07:53.362 --> 07:54.203
But he is stopping.

07:54.223 --> 07:54.783
Of course, why?

07:54.803 --> 07:59.327
It's because of writing at night, candlelight, terrified about his eyes.

07:59.407 --> 08:01.149
Let me interrupt just for a second.

08:02.070 --> 08:06.253
I wonder why he sent the personal papers to Oxford

08:07.280 --> 08:09.823
and really kept the diary here.

08:10.644 --> 08:15.050
Well, the diary... Because he wanted everything neat, so this does raise that question.

08:15.070 --> 08:18.674
Yes, he wanted everything neat, whether it was for the fact that he wanted the Navy neat.

08:20.056 --> 08:20.897
And the Navy was neat.

08:21.217 --> 08:23.200
And he got it and made the Navy neat.

08:23.220 --> 08:28.326
I'm a former naval officer myself, so I know the... Yes, well, the Navy wasn't neat when Pepys came here.

08:29.007 --> 08:31.110
The British Navy was a shambles.

08:31.130 --> 08:34.194
And he regularized procedures for commissions.

08:34.234 --> 08:36.156
He was the first person to...

08:36.440 --> 08:43.212
He introduced the rule by which at the end of every commission, the vessel's log was deposited at the Admiralty.

08:44.154 --> 08:45.376
Which continues to this day.

08:45.397 --> 08:45.537
Yes.

08:46.499 --> 08:47.440
And that was Peeps' idea.

08:48.683 --> 08:49.704
That was a brilliant idea.

08:51.949 --> 08:54.173
You have a record of everything, and it's there.

08:54.273 --> 08:57.739
And if you change something, you just run a line.

08:57.799 --> 09:00.304
I mean, I used to have to make log entries.

09:01.178 --> 09:04.283
You never blot out a line, just a word.

09:04.303 --> 09:05.405
You went a line for it.

09:05.425 --> 09:09.892
So we can see what the mistake was, or what the original thought was, so it's all there.

09:11.073 --> 09:14.338
Also, you say his diary is quite neat.

09:14.358 --> 09:15.460
Did he ever blot a line?

09:15.680 --> 09:23.332
Or do you think if there was a blotted line, he would... There are a few, but very, very few in a million and a half words.

09:23.593 --> 09:26.758
It must have really aggravated him to have to blot a line.

09:27.399 --> 09:29.582
I don't think he liked it at all.

09:30.153 --> 09:39.821
But anyway, to go back to your main point, the point about assertiveness, no, he was meticulously neat in everything that he did.

09:40.662 --> 09:44.806
And you can read about it in the diary when he's setting his house in order.

09:46.207 --> 09:50.731
He liked things to be just so, precise.

09:50.751 --> 09:58.658
And this was something that didn't diminish as he got older.

09:58.942 --> 10:06.634
He was very much concerned about the fate of books, which he had every reason to read.

10:07.476 --> 10:13.024
Many private collections in his time, such as there were, were in chaos.

10:13.044 --> 10:19.374
Charles II's library, from which a number of books found their way into Pepys's, was notoriously in chaos.

10:19.635 --> 10:21.658
Does he so state this in a diary, by the way?

10:22.415 --> 10:25.959
No, we know about Charles II's library from Evelyn's diary.

10:25.979 --> 10:30.265
I mean, does he so state about his concern for the state of books in the library?

10:30.986 --> 10:37.334
No, because, of course, you see, he stopped writing the diary in 1669.

10:37.394 --> 10:38.435
He dies in 1703.

10:39.036 --> 10:42.781
Well, in 1666, he has had his first bookcase made.

10:44.222 --> 10:48.307
And the making of this is reported in the diary, 23rd July.

10:48.328 --> 10:51.932
23 July 1666.

10:52.604 --> 11:21.143
he has his first bookcase made and the reason why he has his bookcase made is because his books are mainly on chairs and when he needs to look at a book which is at the bottom of a heap of books he finds he's not doing so because it's too much of an effort to move the books on top in order to open the book underneath and so he got in a man called Thomas Simpson

11:21.798 --> 11:26.303
with a Y, who was, he calls him Simpson rejoiner.

11:26.383 --> 11:29.467
In fact, he was a Deptford shipwright.

11:30.908 --> 11:32.129
That's crazy.

11:32.150 --> 11:39.277
And with him, he does what he calls contriving.

11:39.358 --> 11:45.785
He sets about contriving of the press to put up my books in.

11:45.805 --> 11:50.590
And this word contriving, I think, is used in his full 17th century sense because

11:51.127 --> 11:56.996
They are the earliest freestanding glass-fronted bookcases known.

11:58.918 --> 12:01.602
I wonder why they're called Peeps bookcases, or are they?

12:01.622 --> 12:06.590
Well, sometimes an auctioneer's jargon, because they continue to be copied right into the 19th century.

12:08.192 --> 12:13.159
And other English 17th century glass-fronted bookcases, open bookcases, are all copies of Peeps's.

12:15.443 --> 12:19.108
You can go to Durham Park, that's G-Y-R-H-A-M,

12:20.658 --> 12:33.717
Durham Park in Gloucestershire, which was the home of Thomas Blathwaite, B-L-A-T-H-W-A-Y-T.

12:33.737 --> 12:44.913
He was the paymaster of the army, a very rich man, post a little bit similar, I suppose, to Pepys'.

12:44.933 --> 12:49.399
But he was a great, unlike Pepys, he was a great peculator.

12:50.054 --> 12:55.563
he amassed an enormous fortune.

12:55.583 --> 13:04.717
And he spent this on building a house, but his bookcases, the library itself is the last, not intact, but the bookcases are.

13:05.819 --> 13:09.164
His bookcases are copies of peeps.

13:09.184 --> 13:17.918
And indeed New York, about 18 months ago, a couple of early 19th century bookcases were sold which were copies of peeps.

13:19.180 --> 13:23.046
And I'll see some of these in there.

13:23.066 --> 13:23.166
Yes.

13:23.186 --> 13:23.547
That's wonderful.

13:23.567 --> 13:26.411
To pick up the thread.

13:26.751 --> 13:29.475
Well, I hadn't asked your questions about unique items.

13:30.617 --> 13:35.224
Yes, there are a lot of only known copies.

13:35.244 --> 13:44.698
And in particular, one finds only known copies amongst the ephemera, the collection of ballads.

13:46.467 --> 13:54.394
the 1250 ballads, single sheet ballads, on which maybe 700 are the only copies.

13:55.535 --> 14:02.642
And in the other thing which people, which we can't display, people don't really get to see, which is his selection prints.

14:03.803 --> 14:05.684
He had 10,500 prints.

14:06.565 --> 14:10.248
Enormous selection prints.

14:11.810 --> 14:15.293
Contemporary prints to him?

14:15.745 --> 14:41.128
some are contemporary some go back to the very dawn of print making i mean yes but he was a connoisseur can you say that oh very much so yes i i i prefer the word virtuoso because that would have been the contemporary okay as an educator sir what is your specialty it's with uh i wonder you're doing them

14:41.851 --> 14:44.093
I wonder if you could tell me what you teach.

14:44.554 --> 14:47.577
Well, I don't really kind of, I don't really fit into the conventional things.

14:47.637 --> 14:50.760
I mean, the Beeps Librarianship is a part-time job.

14:51.300 --> 14:53.582
It's not an entirely happy situation.

14:53.643 --> 14:57.726
I earn my living by teaching, by lecturing in the university.

14:57.747 --> 15:04.713
I lecture in English literature, and over a really wide range, because that's .

15:04.733 --> 15:08.517
Obviously, I tend to gravitate towards 17th century.

15:08.767 --> 15:12.452
but I think I've only ever once given them, once in my whole life, given Electron Peeps.

15:14.095 --> 15:17.279
So my teaching is just not related to my job as librarian at all.

15:17.620 --> 15:24.991
No, this was just for my own... Yes, and in fact, my main field of research is, and this is just to confuse matters further, is musicals.

15:27.775 --> 15:33.383
Oxford just yesterday got a great music collection, by the way.

15:33.403 --> 15:34.685
Oh, in Bodley, in Bodley?

15:34.705 --> 15:35.466
In Bodley, yes.

15:35.935 --> 15:39.259
Yes, it used, of course, to be the Oxford Music Schools Collection.

15:41.001 --> 15:44.525
But they just announced yesterday a major acquisition.

15:45.527 --> 15:47.529
Oh, is it from Chicago?

15:48.450 --> 15:50.072
I do not believe so.

15:50.593 --> 15:52.876
I heard Chicago mentioned yesterday.

15:53.196 --> 16:03.208
I wasn't around for the announcement that this was about to happen, and they gave me some press releases, not press releases, but some literature, which I took, and I haven't had a chance to examine yet.

16:03.762 --> 16:05.744
Because I didn't realize it would be pertinent today.

16:05.804 --> 16:14.674
Yes, well, of course, Pepys has a lot of music because music was his great private passion.

16:15.455 --> 16:18.359
I'm sorry, he reports in the diary about going to wonderful concerts.

16:19.220 --> 16:21.462
Well, he was a player, of course.

16:21.482 --> 16:22.383
I think you should look.

16:22.543 --> 16:26.268
Have you looked at the big edition of the diary by Leighton?

16:26.288 --> 16:27.569
Not the big one.

16:27.589 --> 16:29.231
I have the shorter Pepys.

16:29.251 --> 16:29.331
Yes.

16:29.513 --> 16:40.566
Because there's an enormous amount of valuable information in the companion volume, volume 10.

16:41.507 --> 16:45.531
Volume 10 is rather curiously organized because it's simply alphabetically organized.

16:51.598 --> 16:57.765
But you can read about, I mean it's got articles on books in the diary period.

16:58.100 --> 17:01.844
The library, as such, didn't exist in the diary.

17:01.864 --> 17:09.051
But I think the easiest thing is if we go and have a look at it, and then... Yes, we can do it now.

17:09.071 --> 17:22.323
Because, of course, the date on the outside of the building... Is neither the date of the building, nor the date of Pepys' death, but the date when the library came here.

17:23.244 --> 17:27.128
Because it became, after Pepys' death, it became a usufract.

17:27.631 --> 17:31.235
in the hands of his nephew.

17:31.315 --> 17:31.976
What do we call it?

17:32.376 --> 17:34.659
Usufract, that's when something is a lifetime.

17:34.919 --> 17:35.760
Okay.

17:35.880 --> 17:38.763
Could you spell that for me?

17:38.984 --> 17:40.786
U-S-E-U-F-R-A-C-T.

17:40.806 --> 17:41.266
Okay.

17:41.286 --> 17:42.488
That's a new word for me.

17:43.769 --> 17:46.472
But it's a word which is loyal.

17:47.273 --> 17:50.797
I do have an O-E-D at home, so I'm sure it's there.

17:51.558 --> 17:52.579
Do you want the store closer?

17:52.599 --> 17:53.520
Ah, yes, please.

17:59.609 --> 18:03.453
The building.

18:05.475 --> 18:17.228
What you see, the facade of the Poiseuille, is probably about 1670.

18:17.248 --> 18:25.958
And it actually contributed towards the embellishment of France.

18:25.978 --> 18:28.080
Look at that old padlock there.

18:30.727 --> 18:33.330
Now, is that locked contemporary?

18:34.170 --> 18:34.431
No.

18:34.631 --> 18:36.052
As this is.

18:36.593 --> 18:39.456
This board is steel.

18:39.516 --> 18:43.860
How old would you say that lock is?

18:44.741 --> 18:50.887
Oh, that's modern, but this lock is much older.

18:50.907 --> 18:56.413
Now, if I actually would probably, if you'd just hang on, I'd be able to stay here for a second, because

19:01.810 --> 19:02.311
Oh, yes.

19:04.414 --> 19:05.255
The alarm's on.

19:11.564 --> 19:13.567
The outer steel door.

19:13.587 --> 19:14.308
The inner door.

19:14.328 --> 19:14.709
He's opening.

19:14.869 --> 19:16.351
Unlocking the third door.

19:17.613 --> 19:19.175
And the alarms are on.

19:21.459 --> 19:23.642
There.

19:23.662 --> 19:24.203
Can I enter now?

19:24.403 --> 19:24.563
Yes.

19:27.768 --> 19:29.911
Will I be able to take some of these?

19:30.512 --> 19:31.193
Yes, cool.

19:41.146 --> 19:41.627
Oh, wow.

19:45.051 --> 19:53.483
Oh, this is just wonderful.

19:55.966 --> 19:59.852
I didn't bother to take my camera in quarters, but I didn't really think that would be over.

20:00.252 --> 20:01.974
I didn't bother to take my camera.

20:02.015 --> 20:05.099
Well, actually, the problem about that, we don't allow... That's fine.

20:05.179 --> 20:05.820
I sense that.

20:06.020 --> 20:09.204
And there's a practical reason, but it's not quite difficult.

20:09.224 --> 20:09.685
It's because...

20:10.002 --> 20:13.025
We have a photographer who is wonderful.

20:13.145 --> 20:14.366
And you have some pictures of that.

20:14.386 --> 20:15.447
And he has no, yes.

20:15.767 --> 20:16.948
And he can take them.

20:16.988 --> 20:18.129
But we don't pay him.

20:19.991 --> 20:21.152
He does it really for the fun of it.

20:21.673 --> 20:22.073
That's great.

20:22.133 --> 20:25.756
If there are some pictures, just so I can, when it comes to help me in my writing.

20:26.016 --> 20:30.521
But anyway, let's not even think about that for the moment, let's.

20:30.541 --> 20:32.142
This portrait of Thomas Hill.

20:33.363 --> 20:37.647
The pictures don't make very much sense.

20:37.863 --> 20:41.849
That little picture over there, the seascape, belonged to Pepys.

20:42.230 --> 20:49.100
Pepys had collection pictures, had 65 pictures, but they didn't come to the college, and the collection was dispersed in the 18th century.

20:49.641 --> 20:56.251
That was given to the college by somebody who bought it and recognised what it was, which I thought was very, well, given to the library, not the college.

20:56.331 --> 20:56.852
Very perceptive.

20:56.872 --> 20:59.195
Because the library isn't really part of the college.

20:59.215 --> 21:01.759
The library is not part of the college.

21:02.901 --> 21:07.127
Well, I am, the Pepys I've earned is appointed by the masterman, if it's possible, to the master, not the felix.

21:07.327 --> 21:08.108
I see.

21:08.929 --> 21:14.277
These were extracted from the front of the catalogue.

21:14.317 --> 21:15.679
I'll show you the catalogue in that one.

21:15.759 --> 21:19.665
Is this something I can purchase, by the way, as a catalogue?

21:20.426 --> 21:22.329
Oh, well, yeah.

21:22.369 --> 21:24.592
Yes, you have to have a small fortune to do so.

21:24.612 --> 21:25.654
I'll show you that again.

21:26.134 --> 21:27.697
But this is Pepys' own catalogue.

21:27.777 --> 21:28.458
I'm sorry.

21:28.478 --> 21:34.887
We're talking about... These were the frontest pieces to Pepys' catalogue dated 1693.

21:35.069 --> 21:40.777
These are two illustrations of the library in Pepys' House, York Buildings, now Buckingham Street, Westminster.

21:41.678 --> 21:41.979
Yes.

21:41.999 --> 21:44.001
So you see, there are two views.

21:44.021 --> 21:47.887
Buckingham Street, Westminster is just by where Charing Cross Station is.

21:48.467 --> 21:50.370
And the facade of the house still exists.

21:50.450 --> 21:50.731
Really?

21:50.751 --> 21:52.573
But nothing behind the facade.

21:52.914 --> 21:53.975
It's great pity.

21:53.995 --> 21:58.321
You can see there's the Thames just outside his windows.

21:59.643 --> 22:02.867
And these were his lodgings as secretary of the admiralty.

22:03.288 --> 22:04.890
He never lived in a house of his own.

22:05.123 --> 22:33.882
his life which is very interesting in relation to the amount of money that he spent on the library and this is how it was set up in 1693 and at this time you can see he had seven bookcases and at the end of his life ten years later he had twelve so there's this process of growth in the library which i can demonstrate to you in a moment but anyway you'll see that the organization of the library

22:34.115 --> 22:38.059
Here is a little bit reminiscent of the way in which we have it.

22:38.099 --> 22:40.241
It looks pretty close, actually, when it's set up.

22:42.082 --> 22:49.929
In here, the bookcase is all pieces, and the numbers are, so far as we know, in the order of their construction.

22:50.990 --> 22:56.015
The desk is the final bookcase because it houses the oversized books.

22:57.496 --> 23:02.461
There are other pieces of 17-centred furniture, but they have no connection with Beeps.

23:02.481 --> 23:02.721
Okay.

23:03.410 --> 23:08.075
So you can see how it was with... But this is not the desk.

23:08.616 --> 23:13.220
That is a table with a card on it, which was how they used copies then.

23:14.382 --> 23:19.527
And you can see, again, the tremendous weakness of it.

23:20.048 --> 23:23.632
The desk is... Now, this was his working desk?

23:23.652 --> 23:23.932
No.

23:25.093 --> 23:26.555
Well, not as far as I know.

23:26.595 --> 23:32.421
Obviously, Saruman's mind is involved.

23:33.970 --> 23:49.511
But it must have been made after 1693, and originally it had a drawer under here, which would have made it very difficult to work at.

23:50.873 --> 23:53.417
Somebody's taken that drawer out.

23:53.437 --> 23:58.223
I'm just looking at the title of some of these enormous books, Great Britain's Coasting Pilots.

23:59.425 --> 24:01.868
He had a huge collection of maps that you would expect.

24:02.405 --> 24:04.608
And we've got separate law on the maps.

24:05.971 --> 24:23.839
Now, this... By the way, this quotation here, a private library wrote Peeps should comprehend, quote, in fewest books and least room the greatest diversity of subjects, styles, that's S-T-I-L-E-S, and languages its owners' reading will bear.

24:24.376 --> 24:25.157
close quote.

24:25.177 --> 24:28.339
Is this replicated in one of the publications that I will do?

24:28.359 --> 24:28.680
Yes, it is.

24:28.700 --> 24:29.440
Okay, great.

24:29.460 --> 24:30.842
Yes, that was at the end of his life.

24:30.922 --> 24:33.484
He tried to write a memorandum really to himself.

24:33.844 --> 24:42.291
And it's most uncharacteristic of Peter's writing because there are lots of crossings out there when he was trying to formulate exactly what this library was.

24:42.311 --> 24:47.136
And in fact, he starts off by a long list of things that this library was not.

24:48.197 --> 24:52.841
It was not a public library in a university.

24:52.861 --> 24:53.421
It was not

24:53.671 --> 24:58.737
a library, the library of a professor in the university.

24:59.017 --> 25:03.122
It was a private library, a kind of showing off.

25:03.543 --> 25:05.906
And I think that this is most apparent.

25:05.926 --> 25:12.694
You may have, when you were looking at the Roussard, you would have seen on the front Bibliotheca of Portiana.

25:12.714 --> 25:15.477
And then you would have seen Peake's library motto,

25:16.182 --> 25:16.823
That's his.

25:17.644 --> 25:20.227
I was going to ask you what that was.

25:20.247 --> 25:41.494
I wrote it down, but at one point I... Well, it's a quotation from Cicero's Republic, and it means, I suppose, in my translation, it's difficult to translate, it's very contracted Latin, is the mind of each.

25:41.895 --> 25:44.518
That is what each man is.

25:45.730 --> 25:50.875
You see, and every book has his book plate in it, with his portrait by Nella.

25:52.036 --> 25:53.257
How do we spell Nella?

25:54.398 --> 25:54.979
K-N-E-L-L-E-R.

25:55.139 --> 25:57.041
Okay.

25:57.061 --> 25:58.642
Engraved by Richard White.

26:01.925 --> 26:02.025
Okay.

26:02.045 --> 26:07.150
But what it in fact says, I mean, there is Mr. Peebs, pretty solemnly.

26:07.230 --> 26:09.813
What it says, mind of each, that is what each man is.

26:09.853 --> 26:15.518
In effect, it says this is not, this is not Mr. Peebs, but this and this.

26:15.683 --> 26:20.630
Mr. Peter's wonderful.

26:20.871 --> 26:26.479
And each book also has a different book page at the end.

26:26.519 --> 26:30.285
Those are the fouled anchors of the admiralty, that's the insignia of the admiralty.

26:30.585 --> 26:31.727
But again, the motto.

26:32.928 --> 26:33.810
How do we say it again?

26:34.130 --> 26:37.896
Mens quiusqui, ises quiusqui.

26:38.116 --> 26:41.421
Wonderful.

26:41.890 --> 26:42.591
It's very good.

26:42.611 --> 26:44.434
Now, this is where the diary is.

26:44.494 --> 26:51.605
First of all... Is this so far as you can ascertain the precise manner in which he... Oh, yes, yes, yes, they must be, because they're all arranged by height.

26:51.625 --> 26:53.909
So it's... I'll show you in a minute.

26:53.929 --> 26:54.029
Okay.

26:54.049 --> 26:57.154
To take it... Now, this is bookcase number one.

26:57.174 --> 27:03.725
Okay, you must point out to me why they are not arranged in a strictly chronological order, and some of them are numbered ones.

27:03.745 --> 27:05.227
Well, they go around in a circle.

27:05.387 --> 27:05.788
I see.

27:05.937 --> 27:08.921
And the books go around in a circle, but I'll explain that in a second.

27:08.941 --> 27:11.164
Okay, just hold on, and we'll get there.

27:11.224 --> 27:15.049
Now, you'll see that the, actually, though they look the same, there are changes.

27:15.110 --> 27:16.311
You can see it's most dramatically.

27:16.712 --> 27:22.720
Now, carrying handles, that's important, because you see peeps living in lodgings, so the bookcases break down.

27:24.262 --> 27:27.827
This comes off that, the cornice comes off,

27:28.634 --> 27:32.940
And the whole thing becomes perfectly... The work, the woodwork is quite exciting.

27:32.980 --> 27:36.405
Yes, we'll come to that in a second.

27:36.485 --> 27:41.291
So you've got the carrying handles, and eventually, of course, they were all brought up from London in 1724.

27:42.173 --> 27:43.715
But you'll see that there are differences.

27:43.755 --> 27:44.876
I mean, it's very obvious there.

27:45.677 --> 27:48.541
Iron handle, and then a brass handle on the last ones.

27:49.002 --> 27:51.906
An iron handle on one, and a... Brass handle on the other.

27:51.926 --> 27:56.973
So there are tiny differences between each pair of bookcases.

27:56.993 --> 27:58.455
This is quite deliberate, of course.

27:58.756 --> 28:02.660
No, because people died, you know, as a book finder.

28:02.680 --> 28:14.373
Now, the most dramatic difference, and the importance of this will come here, is that if you look, this bookcase was originally adjustable, kind of practical.

28:14.653 --> 28:15.935
By number one we're talking about.

28:15.955 --> 28:17.076
Yes, you might get today.

28:17.436 --> 28:18.317
Right.

28:18.337 --> 28:21.861
Number 12 has never been adjustable.

28:22.887 --> 28:24.008
The shelves are fixed.

28:24.609 --> 28:26.952
The shelves are while fixed there, but that was done later on.

28:27.213 --> 28:29.996
What do you think keeps discerned along the way?

28:30.317 --> 28:38.507
Well, sorry, but if you let me follow through my thread, then you can ask, I think, questions about it easier.

28:39.068 --> 28:39.308
Right.

28:41.211 --> 28:52.405
When he started, he started with what we would think today as a practical domestic bookcase, one in which you can adjust the shelves or the various types of books you've got.

28:53.093 --> 29:02.102
Eventually, he saw that this was not going to work, and that in order to get the maximum number of books into the smallest place, he was going to arrange them by height.

29:02.142 --> 29:10.110
And so all the books are arranged by height, and you can see that by the end of his collecting, this would become a policy.

29:10.710 --> 29:15.155
And so the last bookcases don't have adjustable shelves.

29:17.938 --> 29:19.579
So the subject is quite irrelevant.

29:19.779 --> 29:20.520
No, quite irrelevant.

29:20.540 --> 29:22.442
The consequences of this, I'll explain in a moment.

29:22.743 --> 29:50.218
um now the carving you noted well the wood oak oddly enough it's not the fashionable wood at the time oak was going out walnut would have been the fashionable wood but oak was the wood that you got in dockyards so and thomas simpson was a lot of yard joiner yeah well there's also a question of dockyard oak and navy board time

29:51.278 --> 29:56.145
And the carving rather puzzles some furniture historians.

29:56.165 --> 30:00.511
In fact, it's much more like the kind of carving that you would have got on the stone galleries of ships.

30:02.533 --> 30:04.296
So it's an adaptation.

30:04.336 --> 30:05.918
How would you describe the carving?

30:05.938 --> 30:07.921
I mean, is that the description?

30:08.121 --> 30:09.944
The technical term is gadrooning.

30:10.685 --> 30:11.946
Gadrooning.

30:13.048 --> 30:14.670
G-A-D-R-O-N-I-N-G.

30:14.853 --> 30:16.255
And these are on the cornices.

30:16.455 --> 30:18.658
And what do we call this part of the bookcase down below?

30:19.078 --> 30:20.560
Just above?

30:20.580 --> 30:21.661
Top of the plinth, yes.

30:21.681 --> 30:22.522
Top of the plinth.

30:22.562 --> 30:22.883
Why not?

30:24.164 --> 30:27.869
And do you think that the same person did these seals, that number of the cases?

30:27.889 --> 30:28.550
Cartouches?

30:30.132 --> 30:31.013
Difficult to say.

30:31.053 --> 30:33.436
Yes, I mean, I think that those cartouches are contemporary.

30:33.956 --> 30:37.220
Cartouches with numbers designating each book.

30:37.240 --> 30:38.081
Yes, that's right.

30:38.101 --> 30:40.084
And they are red with the gold.

30:41.225 --> 30:42.767
I'm just describing it.

30:44.013 --> 30:46.977
Great, you continue, sir.

30:49.080 --> 30:52.965
Well, just to get the diary out of the way, there's no secret about the diary.

30:52.985 --> 31:00.374
Here it is in bookcase number one, and you can see it through the glass, and it's called journal rather than diary on the labels.

31:01.836 --> 31:04.399
Volumes one and two are in a showcase.

31:06.883 --> 31:11.188
So here it is, entered into the library as any other book.

31:12.690 --> 31:13.311
Thank you.

31:14.033 --> 31:15.315
That's fine.

31:15.335 --> 31:16.917
I just touched volume one.

31:17.077 --> 31:19.980
And you see its extraordinary neatness.

31:22.884 --> 31:24.546
And it's in shorthand, not in code.

31:26.649 --> 31:36.341
The shorthand means that many words are in longhand, either because they were proper names, because it was not a phonetic shorthand, or because he'd forgotten the shorthand.

31:38.484 --> 31:42.609
And it was a shorthand which people in his office could read.

31:42.629 --> 31:43.009
They could?

31:43.190 --> 31:43.450
Yes.

31:43.970 --> 31:57.827
so so this is kind of a myth that has grown up it's a bit it's a workable shorthand um which uh

31:58.600 --> 32:03.748
And yet while they understood it, it still took a century itself for it to be deciphered.

32:04.168 --> 32:11.759
Well, what had happened was that obviously the people didn't publish diaries much in the century after Pepe's death.

32:12.100 --> 32:15.284
And what happened was that the shorthand became superseded by other shorthands.

32:16.206 --> 32:17.768
And it was his own, so therefore.

32:17.948 --> 32:18.629
No, it wasn't his own.

32:18.649 --> 32:19.731
It was standard shorthand.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.053
Oh, this was a standard shorthand.

32:21.073 --> 32:24.217
The standard shorthand is called Shelton's Tachigraphy.

32:24.237 --> 32:25.940
Shelton's Tachigraphy.

32:25.960 --> 32:27.342
T-A-C-H.

32:27.524 --> 32:31.169
But again, you can find this in any piece.

32:31.950 --> 32:35.955
I'm just looking at where the diary is housed, the shelves.

32:37.698 --> 32:42.704
There is another shelf just in the rear section of the book.

32:42.724 --> 32:47.811
Well, we're double banking because these are quartos.

32:47.875 --> 32:51.840
They need to be up, otherwise it would be very inconvenient.

32:51.960 --> 32:54.323
He did the double banking, or he did the double banking?

32:54.343 --> 32:57.788
You meaning his... Well, he employed a library clock.

32:58.148 --> 33:00.892
I mean, the system is this.

33:02.033 --> 33:03.075
The system is this?

33:04.416 --> 33:04.817
Yes.

33:04.857 --> 33:06.059
But he employed a library clock.

33:06.079 --> 33:10.264
He had two people in his household, which was a very modest household after his wife's death.

33:10.284 --> 33:11.786
Two people he wouldn't expect to find.

33:13.228 --> 33:17.173
He employed a domestic musician...

33:17.812 --> 33:27.882
Cesare Morelli, who was actually, despite his name, Fleming, and who stayed with him for 30 years.

33:29.003 --> 33:44.178
And he employed, latterly, we don't know when he came into Pepys' employment, a library clerk, who was responsible for doing all of the clerical work, some of the scribal work connected with the library, and there was a great deal of it.

33:44.198 --> 33:47.481
Now, the point of that arrangement, if you arrange by height,

33:48.119 --> 33:51.624
then everything works in the catalogue.

33:51.825 --> 34:10.833
If you arrange by height and you buy more books and have to add more presses, and originally he thought that the whole thing could be contained in two book presses, in the diary when he begins to think about making a library, the whole thing could be contained in two.

34:11.834 --> 34:16.962
Every time you have to add a press, the whole thing has to be reorganised, the whole system.

34:17.768 --> 34:23.856
So you can tell how long a book has been in the library, roughly, by the number of numbers that it's had.

34:24.276 --> 34:25.938
This is in his hand, in a way.

34:25.958 --> 34:31.906
Well, it's impossible to say with 17th century hands, and particularly with numbers.

34:31.926 --> 34:40.157
And Pete wrote three completely different hands, depending on whether he was doing official correspondence, private work, which he wanted to be tidy.

34:40.537 --> 34:43.641
Clearly identifiable as his, though, in each case?

34:44.262 --> 35:12.598
oh no i mean if you say that yeah i mean it's just a question i wouldn't know enough you couldn't tell on that really for anybody okay and that's really nice when you've got a page of it yes of course um but people are frightfully um assertive about this and you can all you can do is demonstrate the wrong so the library this the diary was in the library and regarded as a book rather than a private paper

35:12.764 --> 35:14.526
for a long, long time, you see.

35:14.706 --> 35:22.192
That's about as many... Well, there are the numbers, 720, 721, each scratch dial, 885, 962, 1053.

35:22.693 --> 35:26.056
And then the final number from the last regulation of the library.

35:26.917 --> 35:29.179
So the final number... Which is 1837.

35:29.219 --> 35:29.459
Yes.

35:29.959 --> 35:42.771
The final number is in red, and would not have been put in by Pepys, nor by his library clerk, but by his heir, John Jackson, who had the job of

35:43.679 --> 36:10.665
of putting things into are these are these bindings in which the books were issued or did peeps bind them we don't know no no we know a lot about it there is actually a catalog simply of the bindings in the library a modern catalog because it's the greatest repertoire of information on 17th century this is yes where we stand yes um so there is a catalog by hartnick's

36:11.287 --> 36:15.251
of the bindings alone.

36:15.512 --> 36:29.266
In general, in general, Pepys had books bound for him.

36:30.508 --> 36:39.117
If they were new books, he would have bought them unbound, of course, with maybe two or three exceptions of text.

36:39.738 --> 36:44.923
in the 17th century, occasionally textbooks were sold bound.

36:44.943 --> 36:53.130
And just very occasionally, there's not a copy in the library, very occasionally when a publisher recognised the best seller, he sold it bound.

36:53.150 --> 37:06.042
So the publisher of Pilgrim's Progress recognised what he'd got, printed 4,000, which was a huge print order in those days, and issued it bound.

37:06.062 --> 37:07.804
Occasionally, Pepys bought a book

37:08.965 --> 37:12.188
in a binding and didn't change it.

37:12.268 --> 37:19.615
For example, most, but not all, of the vellum bindings would have been born like that.

37:20.555 --> 37:31.806
But in general, he had books found, and he kept to really three basic standards for ordinary-sized books.

37:34.628 --> 37:35.289
Go ahead.

37:35.309 --> 37:37.791
I'm just taking notes as you speak.

37:38.345 --> 37:39.026
And I'm listening.

37:40.047 --> 37:49.496
And the way that the books are arranged numerically, they go round the entire library in sequence.

37:49.516 --> 37:53.540
So number one is actually in a book, in a showcase at the moment.

37:53.580 --> 37:54.961
But number one is there.

37:55.021 --> 38:01.748
And so it goes one right round, the same level, the whole way around the library.

38:02.789 --> 38:03.790
Amazing.

38:03.810 --> 38:08.014
And then it goes there, there, there, there, there.

38:08.230 --> 38:11.155
and then down to the bottom for the lard.

38:11.195 --> 38:15.342
How would you describe this aroma, which is wonderful?

38:15.442 --> 38:16.864
It's more than lively, it's leather?

38:17.305 --> 38:21.191
Leather, it's the wax that we use on the leather.

38:21.492 --> 38:23.575
Wonderful.

38:23.595 --> 38:28.764
And it's partly, there are cedar wood linings on the sides of the bookcases.

38:29.304 --> 38:30.306
It's partly that.

38:32.429 --> 38:33.911
How many titles are there?

38:34.091 --> 38:36.894
Not titles, but how many volumes would you say there are in the library?

38:37.054 --> 38:40.317
Well, there should be 3,000 books, but seven are missing.

38:40.337 --> 38:40.858
Oh, my God.

38:40.938 --> 38:42.660
That's not titles.

38:42.680 --> 38:48.265
Now, of the seven missing, four or five probably were never put into the library.

38:49.947 --> 38:52.210
We haven't lost any books in this century.

38:53.311 --> 38:55.513
And so there are perhaps three lost.

38:55.533 --> 38:56.474
There are perhaps three lost.

38:56.494 --> 38:57.475
And do we know what they are?

38:57.978 --> 39:10.191
Well, we have a list of the missing books, but we don't know which ones really went missing, which ones Jackson, Peeps's heir, didn't actually finally put into the library.

39:10.271 --> 39:14.795
I suspect because they were on loan when Peeps died.

39:14.815 --> 39:17.778
Peeps himself lent books.

39:17.898 --> 39:18.499
We do know.

39:19.120 --> 39:26.247
If it were possible to acquire these titles, do you think the library would acquire them and add them to the collection?

39:26.834 --> 39:28.375
It would restore them to the collection.

39:28.395 --> 39:29.356
Restore them.

39:29.436 --> 39:30.437
They wouldn't be the titles.

39:30.457 --> 39:32.399
They'd have to be... The actual volume.

39:32.759 --> 39:34.401
And I should say that there's a puzzle about this.

39:34.441 --> 39:40.547
Every so often, we do get excited book dealers saying that they've got... The Lost.

39:40.567 --> 39:42.569
A Peeps... Well, no, they don't know what the titles are.

39:42.629 --> 39:44.831
They've got a Peeps library book.

39:45.051 --> 39:46.072
And indeed, they have.

39:46.252 --> 39:49.895
But it was a book which probably will be a book that Peeps threw out the library.

39:51.277 --> 39:53.258
Because he was extremely selective.

39:53.359 --> 39:54.900
Wouldn't you like a book that he threw out?

39:55.758 --> 40:07.751
Yes, but of course we can't add it to the Pepe's Library, because the whole reason why what makes the Pepe's Library so extraordinary is not the stipulation that it should not be subtracted from, but the stipulation that it should not be added to.

40:08.873 --> 40:09.313
Wonderful.

40:09.794 --> 40:11.676
But you could always add it to an annex.

40:13.197 --> 40:15.720
Well, we have had this difficulty.

40:16.301 --> 40:20.305
Because I would think that you'd like to have it as a 12th century scholar.

40:20.325 --> 40:21.006
Of course not.

40:21.627 --> 40:25.030
No, of course it would.

40:25.151 --> 40:26.752
But you can't have it in here, in this room.

40:27.233 --> 40:29.555
No, and also we have no thumbs.

40:29.675 --> 40:30.556
That's another story.

40:30.856 --> 40:32.999
I mean, we do literally have no thumbs.

40:35.341 --> 40:37.343
Here is the nearest we have got to that.

40:37.563 --> 40:41.567
Now, this is Caxton's translation of Hovid.

40:42.748 --> 40:47.613
Now, Pepys owned books 10 to 15, it's Metamorphoses.

40:47.633 --> 40:48.674
Which we are looking at here.

40:49.115 --> 40:49.295
Yes.

40:50.076 --> 40:51.297
So this is Pepys.

40:51.682 --> 40:54.726
And it was thought that these were the only surviving books.

40:54.746 --> 40:58.852
Now, this is Caxton's translation of Ovid, which he never printed.

41:00.013 --> 41:03.177
And people misunderstand the situation about Caxton.

41:03.198 --> 41:16.195
They don't realize that his main business was running a scriptorium, and that printing was really the cheap end, and that Caxton's main patrons would have bought manuscripts, not printed books.

41:17.076 --> 41:21.402
So he translated the Metamorphoses, but he never got around to printing it.

41:22.495 --> 41:26.440
Now, it was always assumed that this in the Peeps was all that survived.

41:26.941 --> 41:30.466
And indeed, in 1924, the Shakespeare head press printed an edition of it.

41:31.487 --> 41:38.136
But about 25 years ago, somebody came into Sotheby's with books one to nine.

41:38.316 --> 41:39.618
Wasn't this from the Phillips?

41:39.959 --> 41:41.360
It's from the Phillips text, yes.

41:41.380 --> 41:44.364
That was the one found in the pile, the celebrated.

41:44.405 --> 41:45.726
Yes.

41:45.746 --> 41:46.467
This is the copy.

41:46.487 --> 41:52.215
But of course, it had passed out of the Robinson's hands before it went to Sotheby's, I believe.

41:53.022 --> 41:54.424
And that's it, yes.

41:54.765 --> 41:59.832
How did it, if you have no money, how did you manage to get something that was such extraordinary?

41:59.872 --> 42:05.781
Well, partly because a benefactor, Eugene Power of Michigan, really came up with a very large sum of money.

42:05.801 --> 42:06.742
How do we spell that name?

42:07.223 --> 42:08.465
Power, P-A-W-E-R.

42:08.625 --> 42:11.409
Eugene Power of Michigan.

42:11.830 --> 42:21.865
Partly because we published a facsimile edition, and old members of the college bought it, and in doing so were making a large donation.

42:22.925 --> 42:28.253
And partly because the London book trade, and I doubt that they'll do it now, kept out of the bidding.

42:29.675 --> 42:30.216
Very noble.

42:30.516 --> 42:30.656
Yes.

42:31.938 --> 42:32.339
Wonderful.

42:32.859 --> 42:36.625
Even certain strained resources, but you'll see, this is how it was done.

42:37.146 --> 42:39.970
This is a unique copy here.

42:39.990 --> 42:43.074
Oh, well, I mean, all manuscripts are really unique.

42:44.016 --> 42:45.017
But, right.

42:45.166 --> 42:49.692
But it was resumed before, and Caxton never translated this.

42:50.453 --> 42:52.236
I'm sorry, Caxton never printed this.

42:52.256 --> 42:58.804
He translated it, he never printed it, and so far as is known, there was never another manuscript version.

42:59.285 --> 42:59.766
And here it is.

43:00.467 --> 43:00.647
Yes.

43:01.508 --> 43:04.031
Who did the illumination there, I wonder?

43:04.051 --> 43:05.674
Oh, he's always called the Caxton Master.

43:05.694 --> 43:06.895
It's very convenient.

43:06.915 --> 43:07.897
Good.

43:07.917 --> 43:14.886
So we call this Caxton M.S., from his scriptorium, and his translation of Ovid's Metamorphoses,

43:15.355 --> 43:20.642
Books 1 through 9, acquired in 1970, mainly through the generosity of Mr. E.B.

43:20.782 --> 43:22.805
Power, Honorary Fellow of the College.

43:23.666 --> 43:26.089
And as you have just said here, this translation of Ovid's Minimal.

43:26.109 --> 43:27.331
See, I heard about this.

43:27.371 --> 43:31.797
I didn't realize it was here, from a French version by Caxton in 1480.

43:32.398 --> 43:34.761
Pepys bought only part of the manuscript.

43:34.801 --> 43:43.793
The other part, which had been supposed lost, was discovered in 1964 as loose sheets among the remains of the collection left by the famous Victorian bibliophiles, Sir Thomas Thorpe's.

43:44.549 --> 43:45.630
Mayor, do you mind if I do this?

43:46.251 --> 43:55.883
In 1966, it was sold to a New York bookseller itself, please, but the government placed a moratorium on its export, and the college was enabled to buy it by funds raised especially for the purpose.

43:56.543 --> 44:06.135
The sum was provided partly by public subscription and partly by the sale of a facsimile addition, but principally by the munificence of Mr. Eugene Power of Ann Arbor, Michigan.

44:07.027 --> 44:09.470
Pepys will forbade additions to his library.

44:09.511 --> 44:14.858
The first part has therefore been catalogued in the old library but placed here on loan by the master of fellows.

44:15.659 --> 44:17.081
Thank you.

44:17.141 --> 44:19.344
That's really extraordinary.

44:19.625 --> 44:22.509
I should explain that there are three libraries in the college.

44:23.330 --> 44:36.088
There is the college undergraduate library, the old library, which is the college's collection of books before 1875, and virtually every ancient campus college has a similar library.

44:36.541 --> 44:42.869
In fact, the old library is overshadowed by the Peeps, almost unfairly, because it's a remarkable collection.

44:43.950 --> 44:55.204
And we've also got a lot of the, we've got a good little bottom of the material, including manuscripts of three of Eliot's four quartets, and right through from manuscript to proof stage.

44:56.586 --> 45:00.091
So that is an old library book.

45:01.192 --> 45:06.058
I should point out also that you have these two Paxton manuscripts

45:07.068 --> 45:19.329
in a case beneath those two that you mentioned to me earlier.

45:21.071 --> 45:24.978
You mentioned the point about the books at the back being on an elevated shelf.

45:25.058 --> 45:32.130
Well, there's one place in the organization of the library where the system broke down.

45:36.937 --> 45:42.186
Is that okay there, by the way?

45:42.206 --> 45:42.286
Yes.

45:42.306 --> 45:42.406
Okay.

45:42.426 --> 45:45.291
And that's... I'm sorry.

45:45.331 --> 45:47.654
That is it.

45:47.674 --> 45:47.815
Okay.

45:47.835 --> 45:50.339
Isn't that extraordinary?

45:50.359 --> 45:51.200
How did that happen?

45:52.202 --> 45:53.043
How did that happen?

45:54.005 --> 45:59.133
Well, you didn't... I'm sorry, it took me a second to think it would be just in there.

45:59.153 --> 46:02.499
Right, that is... He built up these little feet.

46:02.519 --> 46:04.041
Well, it only happened that one day.

46:04.510 --> 46:09.135
Obviously, much to his mind, the publishers changed the run of books.

46:09.576 --> 46:13.901
The publishers changed the design.

46:14.141 --> 46:21.529
So he had to solve this problem, which he solved in this way, by putting little stills, which, well, no, I don't have to say that as a word.

46:21.569 --> 46:24.553
I mean, I have no idea what.

46:24.573 --> 46:27.336
He put these little blocks, which he killed, you know, there are more.

46:27.356 --> 46:28.357
You see, it's there.

46:28.677 --> 46:31.220
One, two, three, four.

46:31.240 --> 46:32.181
He must have been vexed.

46:33.082 --> 46:33.623
Very nice.

46:36.961 --> 46:40.445
Oh, that's wonderful.

46:40.705 --> 46:44.569
In general, well, this is one instance.

46:44.929 --> 46:50.174
You can see everything is kept exactly as much.

46:50.194 --> 46:55.540
Here we have a book which we have had to put into a slip case.

46:55.580 --> 46:59.484
This is an example of this book.

46:59.964 --> 47:05.550
One of the few examples where Pete, that's actually put an elaborate binding on a book,

47:06.728 --> 47:10.032
There are books with very elaborate bindings, and you can see them here.

47:16.079 --> 47:32.898
But books in very elaborate bindings, on the whole, were given to each dedication copy.

47:33.338 --> 47:33.799
Ah, yes.

47:36.445 --> 47:41.591
That's interesting, because the purchase of that book is described in the diary.

47:41.611 --> 47:44.475
And that's how we know that he bought it for the sake of the binding.

47:44.495 --> 47:50.062
Bought by Pepys in 1660 at the Hague, quote, for love of the binding, close quote.

47:50.082 --> 47:51.644
That's from the diary.

47:51.664 --> 47:53.466
Thomas Farnaby's index was horrific.

47:53.646 --> 47:55.048
Very interesting.

47:55.068 --> 47:56.470
That binding, yes.

47:56.490 --> 48:00.294
Yes, that's Newhouse's whole art of navigation, dedicated to Pepys.

48:01.496 --> 48:03.118
And that copy was presented to him.

48:03.138 --> 48:04.360
That's a presentation copy?

48:05.060 --> 48:05.721
Yes.

48:05.741 --> 48:06.402
London, 1685.

48:06.753 --> 48:07.794
APL 1863.

48:08.094 --> 48:16.363
I'm sure Harvard, where I'm doing most of my archival research has... Well, it'll have the binding catalog.

48:16.823 --> 48:20.687
But this is one of the few books on which Peeps put an elaborate binding.

48:21.968 --> 48:23.990
And this is New Testament by Wycliffe.

48:24.151 --> 48:26.173
Wycliffe's translation of the New Testament.

48:27.094 --> 48:31.598
When you look at it, you can see, again, you can see that it isn't right at the time.

48:32.859 --> 48:33.520
It's not right at the time.

48:33.803 --> 48:36.367
is bound by Richard Mierne.

48:36.387 --> 48:36.987
How do we spell?

48:37.348 --> 48:38.830
M-E-A-R-N-E.

48:40.132 --> 48:40.873
It's extraordinary.

48:42.876 --> 48:43.657
Oh, look at that.

48:48.123 --> 48:49.445
It's breathtaking, isn't it?

48:50.406 --> 48:56.054
And it's a wonderful manuscript because most manuscripts, or many manuscripts, disintegrate as you get to the end.

48:56.094 --> 48:56.955
They get more callous.

48:57.416 --> 48:59.939
But actually, it continues in the same quality.

48:59.979 --> 49:01.121
This is paper.

49:02.363 --> 49:02.663
No.

49:02.930 --> 49:04.052
That's not vellum.

49:04.853 --> 49:06.455
That is vellum.

49:06.475 --> 49:08.057
Very, very fine vellum.

49:09.419 --> 49:10.140
How many lines?

49:11.802 --> 49:12.584
I don't know.

49:12.604 --> 49:14.586
I've never found it.

49:15.728 --> 49:25.502
It'll be to a standard of four, actually.

49:25.522 --> 49:26.122
Extraordinary.

49:28.506 --> 49:29.607
Thirty.

49:29.627 --> 49:32.211
This is an exceedingly rare book in its own right.

49:32.562 --> 49:33.703
Oh, yes, it is.

49:34.064 --> 49:56.728
And it's an interesting book as well, because it gives a lie to the notion that Wycliffe's was a Lollard's Bible, and that the Lollard's, or rather, it gives a notion to the idea that the purpose of Wycliffe's translation was to, or the primary purpose, was to bring the vernacular version to the poem, because this is an immensely expensive manuscript.

49:56.748 --> 50:00.612
Well, just look at the illuminations here, the gold and the

50:01.233 --> 50:07.560
I will have to believe that this was an eminent artist of the period.

50:07.580 --> 50:08.261
Yes, it is.

50:08.341 --> 50:10.184
And what is the date of this?

50:11.365 --> 50:13.327
Well, it's about 1340.

50:13.347 --> 50:14.709
1340.

50:16.531 --> 50:19.414
And Pepys acquired it about when, I wonder?

50:19.434 --> 50:19.835
We don't know.

50:20.315 --> 50:21.557
You can make a guess.

50:21.577 --> 50:23.239
I know.

50:23.719 --> 50:28.325
You see, in this instance, you'd love to have it in its original binding, of course, if such a creature exists.

50:28.705 --> 50:31.088
Well, I don't think such a creature does exist.

50:31.726 --> 50:37.455
That's MS 2073, Wycliffe Bible.

50:38.035 --> 50:41.701
Probably the oldest.

50:41.721 --> 50:45.827
The oldest binding in the vibrant.

50:45.847 --> 50:46.829
That is in number eight.

50:47.129 --> 50:48.031
English binding.

50:49.172 --> 50:51.336
In the back of number eight, which is amazing.

50:51.396 --> 50:54.560
You'd almost think that that would have quite a place, wouldn't you?

50:54.600 --> 50:56.183
This is the oldest binding, I suppose.

50:56.303 --> 50:58.847
The oldest English binding in the Bible.

50:58.867 --> 50:59.468
I don't know.

51:00.009 --> 51:00.990
But this is a

51:01.342 --> 51:07.270
This was, this is a book of ours, and a calendar.

51:07.871 --> 51:09.573
It almost looks like a canteen, doesn't it?

51:09.633 --> 51:12.638
And it was used, I mean, it was used, it's from Durham.

51:12.718 --> 51:21.049
Now I'm not going to try and pull it out, I'm afraid, because it's, but essentially, it's not, but it comes out, and it then unfolds.

51:21.790 --> 51:30.302
And this would have had, you can just see the top of it, a thong, and it was carried by a cleric, um,

51:30.957 --> 51:58.888
drawing a picture attached to the cord of a cassock what do we call it what do you think um a portable yes um but i mean there is one but i mean nick's the thing is checking nick's that's fine so you said it's probably the oldest mining although the oldest the oldest

51:59.172 --> 52:03.498
Yeah, the oldest English rhyming.

52:04.159 --> 52:07.604
It's late 15th century.

52:07.624 --> 52:10.348
And look, there is some really very fine tool in there.

52:10.448 --> 52:15.195
Yes, there is.

52:15.215 --> 52:17.217
What does it contain, did you say?

52:17.358 --> 52:22.665
It contains a calendar, a devotionary calendar.

52:30.087 --> 52:37.693
But on the whole, early themes were of course rebounded by Peeps, just as he rebounded or banned.

52:37.713 --> 52:39.375
I mean, they may not have been in bindings.

52:41.577 --> 52:46.441
We've just said one of the things that Peeps was a pioneer of was ways of keeping books.

52:48.863 --> 52:58.711
I said earlier that apparently content was irrelevant to the scheme.

52:59.071 --> 52:59.892
Subject.

53:00.108 --> 53:16.187
Categorisation by subject is present in the catalogue, not in the physical arrangements of books on the shelves.

53:17.448 --> 53:27.059
A modern computer-generated library, one of those libraries where you press a button and a book comes out of a shelf.

53:27.099 --> 53:29.322
Sorry, a book comes out of a chute.

53:29.757 --> 53:36.207
is arranged on this principle to get the maximum number of books into the smallest place.

53:50.670 --> 53:55.478
This is the catalogue, in fact,

53:55.728 --> 54:00.195
Our main catalogue is not here at the moment because it's been photographed for a facsimile.

54:00.796 --> 54:11.434
Now, books don't leave the room, we never lend, but actually the catalogues, though drawn up to Peep's specifications, aren't actually library books.

54:12.115 --> 54:14.399
Do you follow me?

54:16.302 --> 54:18.265
Books never leave the room and you never lend.

54:18.345 --> 54:20.048
Have there at least been facsimiles?

54:20.551 --> 54:23.395
Are photocopies made of the unique items in particular?

54:23.575 --> 54:26.620
Well, when we get an order to do it, we keep one for ourselves.

54:26.700 --> 54:36.855
But having no funds, we... Obviously, the real box, it's a diary we've got.

54:36.935 --> 54:41.181
That is a worthwhile project that some benefactor should underwrite, I would think.

54:41.201 --> 54:42.663
Wouldn't you think so?

54:45.347 --> 54:49.613
Yes, but of course, we don't know exactly what is unique.

54:50.133 --> 54:56.299
And we are gradually working that way, but it has to be a slow process.

54:57.220 --> 55:17.001
Now, it's unfortunate that the main volume of the catalogue isn't here because that does show you very clearly

55:17.825 --> 55:44.170
how meticulously organized it is but it's organized both by author and by subject um and the arrangement when you've got all three volumes of the cataloging play

55:46.343 --> 55:49.408
This is his catwalk.

55:49.728 --> 55:53.934
It almost looks like a tree then, a family tree.

55:53.974 --> 56:01.205
So when you look something up, the main volume isn't here, because it's being photographed at the University Library.

56:02.187 --> 56:09.838
But when you look something up, I mean, it's a pity I just can't demonstrate, and this is because we're closed, and that's why I was having it first for us, we were closed.

56:11.020 --> 56:14.325
But you look up the subject, you think of the subject, you look it up,

56:14.828 --> 56:20.733
And books are often entered in two or three ways, so that you can't miss it.

56:21.654 --> 56:28.720
And there are cross-references, you see, are very thorough.

56:29.240 --> 56:36.346
So sea matters, sea war, actually, and it takes you to history under sea.

56:39.209 --> 56:44.413
That meaning not history under the sea, but history, look under sea, the history of the sea.

56:44.731 --> 56:51.558
Miscellany of Matters Naval, these are professional papers, which he did keep in the library.

56:52.159 --> 56:55.122
Navy Royal, then look under sea.

56:55.522 --> 56:58.605
Let me just draw a little picture of this, if you don't mind.

56:58.645 --> 57:07.575
That is something that I'll hear it, but I think it will help if I can have a visual image.

57:10.598 --> 57:13.681
And this is his system again?

57:14.242 --> 57:14.502
Yes.

57:14.600 --> 57:16.382
Yes.

57:16.402 --> 57:19.965
It's very clever, then.

57:19.985 --> 57:24.048
It looks quite functional, too, doesn't it?

57:24.189 --> 57:25.910
Of course it's functional.

57:25.950 --> 57:33.257
The man who ran the Navy didn't organize a library on some kind of ludicrous principle to mystify people.

57:33.277 --> 57:35.178
It's absolutely clear.

57:35.198 --> 57:36.700
And everything is systematic.

57:36.720 --> 57:43.746
So in his collection of prints, well, I hardly dare start getting into this because it would take ages to explain, but in his system of prints,

57:44.182 --> 57:50.070
Prints are arranged on an art memory principle and on a cosmological principle.

57:51.331 --> 57:54.095
Just knowing that is wonderful.

57:54.375 --> 57:56.959
So what you do is you look up a subject.

57:57.119 --> 57:59.002
You can't do it now because this is the appendix.

57:59.022 --> 58:00.083
These are the things that work.

58:00.584 --> 58:01.365
You look up a subject.

58:01.385 --> 58:03.868
This gives you the idea of what a main catalog is like.

58:03.888 --> 58:05.190
This is really all I need, sir.

58:05.811 --> 58:06.932
And it takes you out.

58:07.267 --> 58:35.451
to a number now you'll see that there are two numbers one crossed out in best name or manner so you can read it that is the penultimate state of the light the red numbers that i explained is the final state this word here is vice by the way um so so you look so and then it gives you another two eight two seven now here we have the original but we use these printed versions so two eight two seven

58:36.106 --> 58:37.128
You look up 2827.

58:37.248 --> 58:39.171
You can even use it here.

58:39.471 --> 58:42.896
It's wonderful.

58:43.077 --> 58:45.380
Because this library is in constant use.

58:45.400 --> 58:45.841
It's wonderful.

58:45.901 --> 58:53.012
I mean, it's not in use by, on the whole, we try and keep, we don't have toggle readers under no circumstances.

58:53.252 --> 58:53.753
That's correct.

58:54.214 --> 59:04.830
And my job is mainly answering queries, because you see, when every bit of damage done is a bit of damage in the kind of, it makes less seamless what

59:05.519 --> 59:08.964
is in itself, as an entity, you mean.

59:09.044 --> 59:22.465
I know of no other library which has not been added to, which is kept exactly as it was, in which the order of the books can't be checked, because of the numbering system, you see.

59:22.766 --> 59:25.410
But it is an absolutely practical library.

59:25.430 --> 59:26.391
And it's not just practical.

59:26.411 --> 59:33.923
The reason we're having a facsimile done, which is going to be published, is because, of course, the categorisation tells you a great deal about peeps of mine.

59:35.354 --> 59:38.998
Anyway, so you then look it up, 2827, I said, wasn't it?

59:39.058 --> 01:00:05.310
So you look up 2827, and this tells me that it is in case number six, and that it is, oh, about whatever it is, I can't do the mathematics, 12 books along from the left, and that it's on shelf five, which makes it a big book down at the bottom.

01:00:17.356 --> 01:00:20.841
Okay.

01:00:21.943 --> 01:00:22.784
Oh, that's wonderful.

01:00:23.526 --> 01:00:27.692
I'm just drawing a little picture over here as you're over there.

01:00:27.712 --> 01:00:28.433
So that's shelf.

01:00:29.976 --> 01:00:30.817
Five, let's say.

01:00:31.999 --> 01:00:39.811
Case one, two, three, four, five, six, twelve.

01:00:41.273 --> 01:00:43.617
And then these are the numbers consecutively.

01:00:44.478 --> 01:00:45.540
Two, seven, one, one,

01:00:45.841 --> 01:00:47.669
82731.

01:00:50.421 --> 01:01:00.947
Brilliant.
