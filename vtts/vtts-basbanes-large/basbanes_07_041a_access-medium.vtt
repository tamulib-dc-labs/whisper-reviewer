WEBVTT

00:02.579 --> 00:05.124
We're talking in St.

00:05.144 --> 00:09.733
Louis with Mr. Carl A. Peterson, P-E-T-E-R-S-E-N, is that right?

00:09.953 --> 00:13.059
P-E-T-E-R-S-E-N.

00:14.021 --> 00:18.489
If you misspelled my name, I'll claim that I never said any of these things.

00:19.170 --> 00:22.697
I'm sure Bob told you.

00:22.880 --> 00:26.184
I intend to hire a fact checker, by the way.

00:26.204 --> 00:28.027
Let me ask you about your name.

00:28.227 --> 00:29.609
It's Greek.

00:29.969 --> 00:34.375
It has an unfamiliar rhythm to it.

00:34.515 --> 00:38.901
And I decided it has to be either Albanian or something.

00:39.021 --> 00:40.783
Albanian is close.

00:40.883 --> 00:42.546
It has to be from that area.

00:42.586 --> 00:43.687
Well, it's Greek.

00:44.028 --> 00:44.829
It is Greek.

00:44.869 --> 00:48.493
From that part of Greece, which is very close to Albania.

00:49.795 --> 00:51.317
But you would say Bosbanese.

00:52.613 --> 00:59.425
There's really no B in Greek, it's actually a B, so Basbainish, but it's been anglicized to Basbainish.

00:59.525 --> 01:00.827
Is that S at the end?

01:00.928 --> 01:02.450
Is that like an SH?

01:02.470 --> 01:03.392
Is it Basbainish?

01:03.752 --> 01:06.537
No, no, it's Basbainish.

01:06.658 --> 01:09.222
It's B.

01:09.421 --> 01:17.232
You told me that you started collecting in about 1948, I guess.

01:17.312 --> 01:29.730
I was collecting in 1948, and after the collection was enough important that people would ask me, and as I say, I'm not sure whether they're being flighted or whether they're being curious, why did you collect four things?

01:29.750 --> 01:39.343
For a long time, I gave a stupid answer, and then I realized that if somebody asked me that, I would say, did you ever collect anything?

01:39.610 --> 01:43.935
And if they didn't even collect anything, there was no way I could answer their question.

01:44.596 --> 02:05.162
But if they said, well, I collected stamps when I was a kid, or I collected coins, or I collected wall sconces, or whatever, then I could answer their question, because then I could say, well, you have to have that strange, kind of orderly inquisitiveness

02:06.003 --> 02:13.720
As part of your personality, before you can understand why somebody would collect something specific, did you always have that?

02:14.401 --> 02:22.138
Yeah, I collected stamps when I was in school.

02:22.962 --> 02:27.809
Somewhere along the line in high school, I discovered Santa Clara Lewis.

02:28.050 --> 02:30.754
And that's when I was going to collect books.

02:30.834 --> 02:34.620
I was going to collect Santa Clara Lewis.

02:34.640 --> 02:37.584
You were a kid in high school.

02:37.604 --> 02:41.430
Yeah, and I didn't have any money, obviously.

02:41.590 --> 02:44.194
So that kind of went by the wayside.

02:44.326 --> 02:49.491
Of course, in those days, there were finally second-hand bookstores, many, many more than there are now.

02:49.511 --> 02:52.534
Can you just, let me interrupt a little bit?

02:52.554 --> 02:57.279
Can you give biographical facts, where you're from, and where we're talking about when you're talking about high school?

02:57.759 --> 03:06.348
Well, I was born and went to grade school, and went to high school, and went to college on the south side of Chicago.

03:06.368 --> 03:08.570
Okay, so you went into Chicago.

03:08.590 --> 03:12.274
And the college was Illinois Institute of Technology, and there

03:12.659 --> 03:23.715
there's chemical engineering and of course there are not too many electives available because there's such a full

03:23.864 --> 03:30.795
a menu of mathematics, chemistry, physics, and so forth.

03:31.977 --> 03:36.804
But when it came time for lectures, I enjoyed literature.

03:36.944 --> 03:37.866
I enjoyed reading.

03:38.547 --> 03:43.735
And I took the course in contemporary American literature.

03:44.356 --> 03:47.661
Contemporary American literature in 1948.

03:47.928 --> 03:50.954
was, of course, T.S.

03:50.974 --> 03:58.129
Eliot, who hasn't been born in some minutes, although that's nothing to do now.

03:58.149 --> 04:00.233
I mean, this is still back after Chicago.

04:00.466 --> 04:09.278
and then all of the people that gathered for us, and that was the poetry part.

04:09.298 --> 04:10.800
Well, there were a weird time.

04:10.840 --> 04:12.603
There were certainly contemporaries everywhere.

04:12.623 --> 04:20.073
And then the short stories of everyone from Dorothy Parker to James III.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.636
But there were four novels in the course.

04:22.656 --> 04:26.862
Four novels were The Sun Also Rises,

04:27.348 --> 04:29.271
Look Homeward Angel.

04:30.172 --> 04:34.057
What is the Dos Passos?

04:34.197 --> 04:36.741
America.

04:36.821 --> 04:37.101
USA.

04:37.201 --> 04:37.702
USA.

04:37.922 --> 04:38.703
USA.

04:39.104 --> 04:41.187
And all three of those writers I'd heard of.

04:41.327 --> 04:47.595
I'd heard of Thomas Wolfe because somebody began to hear about Thomas Wolfe.

04:47.615 --> 04:52.782
And of course, anyway, and Dos Passos I had somehow

04:53.352 --> 05:18.010
there was a book called i lay dying i never heard of one and so i read that book and first thing was how can somebody write about these people that i'm a city boy this is about country people

05:18.142 --> 05:21.749
How could somebody write about these people in such a way that I am so fascinated?

05:21.869 --> 05:32.150
And then, what is it about this writer that makes this all so good?

05:32.210 --> 05:34.615
It's so exciting.

05:34.966 --> 05:42.196
So then, of course, the professor, who was a man named Howard Vincent.

05:42.216 --> 05:45.600
Howard Vincent had written a book called The Trying Out of Moby Dick.

05:45.640 --> 05:49.365
Howard Vincent was an elder specialist.

05:49.566 --> 05:55.033
And he talked about other books by Faulkner.

05:55.553 --> 06:01.222
In 1948, most of them were out of print, although there were some paperbacks coming out.

06:01.462 --> 06:09.214
After all, as I lay down, I was in that modern library, pairing with the Song of the Fury.

06:10.096 --> 06:17.207
That was about the same period that the paperbacks were coming out, Sanctuary, Wild Pops.

06:17.187 --> 06:27.450
he was kind of at his still kind of at his nadir at that point oh yes yes uh he was until uh the nobel

06:27.920 --> 06:39.001
So anyway, I wanted to read more of those books.

06:39.542 --> 06:48.038
So I went to some of those bookstores that, as I said, used to be around Chicago, where they would have first editions.

06:48.608 --> 06:50.693
And I bought, I bought light lines for $10.

06:51.155 --> 06:52.639
Jesus, you know, and I paid for mine.

06:55.245 --> 06:59.376
And I don't even have the dropped letter on that, you know.

06:59.537 --> 07:00.940
So I bought light lines for $10.

07:01.121 --> 07:01.702
You have a jacket?

07:02.204 --> 07:03.607
Oh, yeah.

07:04.089 --> 07:05.352
How old were you in 48?

07:05.703 --> 07:29.483
uh nineteen nineteen and this was your first acquisition yeah that's the first collector's uh level uh when i sold my collection master i did not dispose of that well that joint modern library well that's kind of your readings does it have more

07:29.733 --> 07:34.039
Yeah, it's just a book.

07:34.279 --> 07:39.205
It's the first book.

07:39.826 --> 07:46.836
Then jumping ahead, I buy the books as I can find them.

07:46.856 --> 07:50.781
In 1950, I got out of school.

07:50.801 --> 07:55.767
Pardon me, at the age of 19, you were an undergraduate or you were out of high school?

07:55.787 --> 07:57.850
Yeah, this was chemical engineering.

07:58.100 --> 08:04.431
I bet you were a freshman or so probably late.

08:04.698 --> 08:11.347
They started collecting when you were in college, so that's very interesting to me.

08:11.487 --> 08:12.669
Oh, yes.

08:12.889 --> 08:16.454
I started acquiring when I was in college.

08:18.077 --> 08:20.039
That's a technical thing.

08:20.059 --> 08:24.165
What's the difference between an acquisition and a collection, or an accumulation?

08:24.185 --> 08:26.769
Well, it was just a verb that I used.

08:27.089 --> 08:31.195
I don't forget to do that.

08:31.563 --> 08:41.154
I graduated to get my bachelor's degree in June of 1950, and two weeks after the Korean War started.

08:41.935 --> 08:47.362
So I... You're a young lad now of 21, apparently.

08:47.422 --> 08:47.782
Right.

08:48.243 --> 08:50.205
You want to do this again, please?

08:50.225 --> 08:50.666
Yeah.

08:50.906 --> 08:54.330
And the thing is that...

08:54.580 --> 08:58.147
When I got out of school, there was a recession.

08:58.167 --> 09:06.524
And then two weeks later, there was the Korean War, and then I was draft bait, and there was an economy starting to thrive.

09:07.025 --> 09:10.392
But it was about two months before I got a job.

09:10.412 --> 09:13.939
Well, then I worked for six months before I was drafted.

09:13.919 --> 09:17.024
So I was drafted in the early part of 1951.

09:17.205 --> 09:21.592
Okay, so at this point you've been collecting for three years and you went off in the service.

09:21.933 --> 09:25.239
Yeah, but in a very... Did you take your books off to the service with you?

09:25.820 --> 09:27.723
No, I wrapped them up.

09:28.063 --> 09:30.047
There weren't that many.

09:30.267 --> 09:31.089
Well, there were enough.

09:31.109 --> 09:33.092
There weren't that many, but I wrapped them up.

09:33.410 --> 09:47.964
And then, uh, when I was stationed in Philadelphia, it was a year and a half stationed, uh, I walked things at, uh, I don't know what I want, but I, in Sessler, in Philadelphia.

09:47.984 --> 09:48.485
I don't know what I want.

09:48.505 --> 09:50.046
Was there a Louder Milks down there, no?

09:50.487 --> 09:50.647
Pardon?

09:50.667 --> 09:52.389
Wasn't there a Louder Milks?

09:52.429 --> 09:53.730
No, Louder Milks is in Washington.

09:53.750 --> 09:55.312
They're in Washington.

09:55.492 --> 09:57.994
Louder Milks is in Washington.

09:58.054 --> 10:00.717
And I never, uh, never, uh,

10:00.933 --> 10:03.776
I don't know anything there.

10:04.858 --> 10:11.185
But I did visit about them, yeah.

10:11.986 --> 10:14.549
But Goodspeed's up in Boston.

10:14.950 --> 10:15.671
And then?

10:16.352 --> 10:17.273
You went to Goodspeed's?

10:17.293 --> 10:20.497
Oh, yeah.

10:20.837 --> 10:27.785
I think I bought As I Lay Dying Goodspeed's.

10:27.805 --> 10:30.028
You'd be disheartened to see...

10:30.683 --> 10:34.099
how mediocre his selection of books has become.

10:34.119 --> 10:36.610
He's really an art and print deal, I know.

10:37.163 --> 11:00.842
Well, I wonder how many people were collecting modern firsts in the 1940s and early 50s.

11:00.822 --> 11:02.265
Not too many.

11:02.385 --> 11:04.088
I mean, not compared to today.

11:04.148 --> 11:05.831
It's kind of a recent phenomenon.

11:05.851 --> 11:13.145
The reflection is that the dealers... Yeah, well, I think it's also the availability and the unavailability of things, too.

11:13.165 --> 11:22.662
Anyway, in June of 1952, I went to New York and I had seen the ads for House of Books Lemonade.

11:23.232 --> 11:49.003
and i went to uh awesome books limited and the captain was still alive in those days who he was still alive and i remember i can find the records what i bought i think i bought uh sound and the fury for 22.50 and

11:48.983 --> 11:57.139
These are $2,000, $3,000 books they have.

11:57.220 --> 12:04.635
And then when I bought those, Martin says to me, okay, now you're not a cataloghound anymore.

12:04.675 --> 12:05.256
You're another what?

12:05.376 --> 12:07.380
A cataloghound.

12:07.360 --> 12:17.979
Because I had, I had, I don't know, while I was in Philadelphia, maybe even before I either went into the area, I had written a house of books.

12:18.059 --> 12:23.348
Please send me your catalog, please send me your free catalog or whatever.

12:23.429 --> 12:28.778
And I worked for it.

12:29.872 --> 12:33.038
Over the years, Margie became married.

12:33.058 --> 12:36.726
I'm sorry that she didn't look the right way.

12:37.066 --> 12:40.172
I'd love to have interviewed her.

12:40.192 --> 12:41.475
Did you know her at all?

12:41.495 --> 12:43.258
No, I mean, I've missed it.

12:43.278 --> 12:48.228
I understand that she looked the wrong way in the street in London, is that right?

12:49.250 --> 12:51.154
Yeah, apparently.

12:51.860 --> 12:55.668
Yeah, that was 1984?

12:56.129 --> 13:04.026
Yeah, whatever.

13:04.227 --> 13:09.678
She was a marvelous friend.

13:09.779 --> 13:11.843
I know she would talk.

13:12.059 --> 13:12.840
about her.

13:13.201 --> 13:18.108
She put a, my young collectors, I'm so lucky I have my young collectors, especially after Louis.

13:18.128 --> 13:20.311
Louis died in 1953.

13:20.532 --> 13:30.546
And, uh, Marty was always kind of the shy member of the organization.

13:30.566 --> 13:33.391
And after Louis died, she just went with it.

13:33.491 --> 13:35.233
I'd love to talk to you about it.

13:35.253 --> 13:38.438
I bet she would have had a million really worthwhile

13:38.570 --> 13:45.400
I wonder if she's done an oral history anywhere right now.

13:45.600 --> 13:47.463
I've been finding oral histories by the way.

13:47.483 --> 13:48.805
Well, let me put it this way.

13:48.825 --> 13:58.900
In 1978 or 79, I rented tape recorders and we had some conversations.

13:58.920 --> 14:01.103
You have some conversations with her on tape?

14:01.203 --> 14:01.403
Yeah.

14:02.204 --> 14:03.987
You're kidding.

14:03.967 --> 14:12.255
at least anything that you're willing to uh i'd be willing to play for you i don't know let's let's do that after a while yeah

14:12.488 --> 14:21.419
She had talked about it.

14:22.119 --> 14:29.788
She had talked about doing something like that.

14:29.808 --> 14:32.852
This should really be an oral history, you know.

14:32.932 --> 14:40.060
She had talked about it to her, and I said, well, let's do it, and so forth.

14:40.161 --> 14:41.382
And then...

14:41.969 --> 14:45.477
She was always reluctant to write anything down.

14:45.497 --> 14:51.931
She was always reluctant to have anybody take her seriously about the story she told.

14:51.951 --> 14:55.538
Because she would tell these stories over and over again.

14:55.799 --> 15:02.273
She would tell the story of how Louie became a book collector.

15:02.438 --> 15:10.369
I forget who it was.

15:10.409 --> 15:12.972
Louie was Margie's husband.

15:13.453 --> 15:20.783
Louis Henry was in the French fashion, she called him Louie.

15:21.123 --> 15:29.695
And he had, he read Louie and it seemed that he

15:30.080 --> 15:35.446
When the new books would come out, he would buy them.

15:35.587 --> 15:41.013
And he saw the latest, you know, title, someplace for a certain price.

15:41.033 --> 15:46.039
And then he visited the Drakes.

15:47.060 --> 15:48.502
And he mentioned this title.

15:48.582 --> 15:50.424
And they said, well, we have that title.

15:50.444 --> 15:51.105
And they mentioned it for us.

15:51.125 --> 15:54.109
And they said, well, that's a different price from the owner.

15:54.129 --> 15:55.210
And they said, well,

15:55.493 --> 16:15.038
you're talking about the american edition we're talking about the english edition which is the first edition and she said that's how louis became a book collector because he learned that there was a difference between the two now louis did uh this is uh in the late 20s

16:15.541 --> 16:25.178
Louis did a bibliography which is still the early... Well, Hanneman was just kind of... Right.

16:25.278 --> 16:35.355
But Hanneman, by the way, spent a lot of time with my... Louis's bibliography was done by 1930, which is very early.

16:35.335 --> 16:47.353
think i mean the guys the corpus is hardly put together let's see 1930 really right the guy's probably been a writer for uh six or seven years

16:47.435 --> 16:54.923
I agree, but we did this, and in the process of doing it, he got to know him.

16:55.063 --> 16:56.004
He got to know him.

16:56.044 --> 16:58.727
Don't forget, Parallel to Arms is 1929.

16:58.808 --> 17:02.071
1929, I haven't.

17:02.091 --> 17:06.516
You see, I think 1929 is a spectacular year.

17:06.596 --> 17:14.725
1929, Parallel to Arms, Look Homeward, Angel, and The Song and the Period.

17:15.464 --> 17:31.586
And the Pulitzer Prize, I'm not sure now whether it went to Julia Peterkin's Scarlet Sister Mary, or whether it went to an Indian novel.

17:31.726 --> 17:35.331
There was a writer who used to write about the American Indians.

17:36.112 --> 17:40.138
It's a long-forgotten, probably.

17:40.439 --> 17:43.043
I've studied years, by the way.

17:43.083 --> 17:46.228
Twenty-nine is when I... Sixty-one, for instance, is a wonderful year.

17:49.052 --> 17:51.095
John F. X. Rabbit Run.

17:51.115 --> 17:55.482
Walker Percy's The Movie Goer, which I love.

17:55.502 --> 17:56.644
Walker Percy, I love.

17:56.664 --> 17:59.628
I just better get to write Walker Percy.

18:00.149 --> 18:02.633
John Steinbeck's Winter of Our Discontent.

18:03.136 --> 18:07.662
Of course, he's not American, but Malcolm will always enter the volcano.

18:07.682 --> 18:09.645
Very interesting year, 61.

18:10.486 --> 18:12.869
Did you get the bullets in that year?

18:12.889 --> 18:17.175
How about... I mean, some total... Is Catch-22 61?

18:17.275 --> 18:18.998
Catch-22 is 61.

18:19.719 --> 18:21.381
Catch-22...

18:21.361 --> 18:23.124
That's right, exactly right.

18:23.424 --> 18:25.267
Catch-22 lost out.

18:25.648 --> 18:29.654
The National Book Award went to Walker Percy.

18:31.177 --> 18:34.081
Nobody had a book in the remainder.

18:34.221 --> 18:36.285
I think the first printing of that was like 1500.

18:37.186 --> 18:38.628
Very, very, very interesting.

18:38.648 --> 18:41.513
It's funny how creative talent seems to

18:41.746 --> 18:51.099
Malcolm Cowley, who did The Portable Faulkner, right, has written about years, two years, and I'll have to go back, 29.

18:51.259 --> 18:54.284
I mean, I didn't realize that all those books were that year.

18:55.045 --> 18:55.766
It's fascinating.

18:56.527 --> 19:03.136
Let's talk about you, and we'll talk about Margie a little later, because I really am interested in you, about your fascination.

19:03.436 --> 19:11.668
Again, you're a chemist, a chemical engineer, and are all these things compatible?

19:12.256 --> 19:20.365
Oh, yeah, I think if I learn nothing else... Chemists and engineers are very precise, though, and very mechanical.

19:20.425 --> 19:27.232
Well, if I learn nothing else, it's that all kinds of prejudices have foolish backgrounds.

19:27.312 --> 19:28.513
That's a good point.

19:28.533 --> 19:34.219
Well, you know, he does this, therefore he can't do that, or something else.

19:34.239 --> 19:39.765
Or as you guys know, and certainly as book dealers know,

19:39.745 --> 19:43.632
Fantastic collections in towns.

19:44.374 --> 19:49.083
How can there be a collection in Kansas City or how can there be a collection in Denver?

19:49.103 --> 19:52.049
That's why I'm here, you know, in St.

19:52.109 --> 19:52.810
Louis.

19:52.975 --> 19:55.038
And that's right.

19:55.098 --> 20:05.192
And here in San Luis, you have two people who have obviously a rabid fascination with Walker.

20:05.312 --> 20:06.734
Amazing, isn't it?

20:06.834 --> 20:08.616
And you know, two people in one town.

20:08.636 --> 20:10.018
It's spectacular.

20:10.038 --> 20:13.583
I did tell him, by the way, I reached him this morning.

20:14.339 --> 20:18.130
I did mention that I'll see you tomorrow.

20:18.250 --> 20:23.325
He did say that it is Carl Peterson who made me a collector.

20:23.345 --> 20:27.336
I read your book in 1975.

20:28.278 --> 20:32.283
And he said, wow, if he can do this, then I can do it.

20:32.303 --> 20:38.731
So he said, I don't know whether that's a tip of the hat or what, but he did say that.

20:38.751 --> 20:54.471
When I wrote that book or some of that book or whatever, one of the things I had in there was the copy of Soldiers' Pay that had belonged to Shirley Adams.

20:54.974 --> 21:16.037
and sherwood anderson had helped get that one focus and uh when aldi saw that he was he was very nice let me say for the benefit of my type is ld l period d period

21:16.928 --> 21:21.393
He was buying from the Margie and he went to Margie and he said... Went to whom, I'm sorry?

21:21.413 --> 21:25.517
To Margie and he says, how does Carl get such a book?

21:25.537 --> 21:30.162
And she says, well, Carl knows Mrs. Anderson.

21:30.182 --> 21:42.336
And from that, I think he was emulated to realize that dealing with book dealers was not the way to get the really juicy items.

21:43.096 --> 21:46.480
The way to get the juicy items is to find the people who were talking.

21:46.730 --> 21:49.734
And to Eldon's credit, he did.

21:49.814 --> 21:52.518
He went to people that knew Faulkner.

21:52.798 --> 21:54.781
He had little kids together.

21:54.801 --> 21:58.626
He went to members of the family.

21:58.646 --> 22:03.092
He really went after those things.

22:03.293 --> 22:04.715
Is this a philosophical thing?

22:04.735 --> 22:06.978
I mean, what's wrong with going to dealers?

22:07.418 --> 22:08.019
Pardon?

22:08.039 --> 22:09.882
What's wrong with getting your books from dealers?

22:10.062 --> 22:11.384
Oh, no, no, no, no.

22:11.464 --> 22:13.146
No, no, I'm just curious because I think there is.

22:13.407 --> 22:14.408
There's nothing wrong.

22:14.388 --> 22:20.336
If you go to a WhatsApp, how do dealers get their books?

22:20.356 --> 22:23.220
Somebody sells them, or they seek it out.

22:23.240 --> 22:27.887
But do dealers go to Paul Holmes' job?

22:27.907 --> 22:35.838
Or do dealers go to John Williams, who was Paul Holmes' mistress in the late 40s and 50s?

22:35.858 --> 22:40.284
Do dealers go to Mehta, who was his lover out there?

22:40.304 --> 22:40.744
They don't.

22:40.824 --> 22:41.926
They don't know about it.

22:42.126 --> 22:42.707
And so...

22:43.075 --> 22:45.106
someone like L.D.

22:45.246 --> 22:50.655
and myself to a lesser extent will seek out these people

22:50.838 --> 23:13.487
and see if we can work out have you done this yourself uh to a lesser extent but you know i've had some success it is very interesting yeah we're going to get to that later because i think that this is uh i have to tell you you're the first major collector i've interviewed who has in fact

23:13.855 --> 23:17.922
dissolved his collection.

23:17.943 --> 23:20.086
And we have to talk about that at some point.

23:20.167 --> 23:22.791
Well, I talked a little bit.

23:22.812 --> 23:25.056
I wanted to talk to Arthur Houghton when he left me.

23:25.076 --> 23:32.690
After a conversation, I started talking about it a little bit today, and I thought a new insight.

23:32.810 --> 23:36.657
In the 40s and the 50s,

23:37.430 --> 23:45.263
This collection served a very useful purpose.

23:45.867 --> 24:02.134
It was stimulating to me and it gave me a way to, for instance, when I was in the Army and afterwards, it gave me another area to concentrate on besides the means by which I get my education, I get through the Army, I make my living.

24:03.236 --> 24:05.039
It was very useful in that way.

24:05.159 --> 24:10.828
And now I'm getting close to retirement and this collection is serving a very useful purpose.

24:10.808 --> 24:20.636
Because now, with having had a great deal of pleasure from it, I have turned it into money, which is what I need for retirement.

24:20.656 --> 24:26.381
It would be great to have a happy retirement and still possess the collection.

24:26.902 --> 24:28.243
But I don't have the needs for that.

24:28.923 --> 24:37.010
So now the collection has been sold, and I'm not going to get all philosophical about somebody else enjoying it.

24:37.151 --> 24:40.073
I don't care whether they enjoy it or not.

24:40.323 --> 24:45.567
At both ends of the lifespan, it has served a purpose.

24:45.687 --> 24:46.388
And I think it's great.

24:46.448 --> 24:52.773
And in between, I've met a lot of people that I enjoy going and providing.

24:53.474 --> 24:56.717
The sad thing is, so many of them are dead now.

24:56.757 --> 25:03.502
Carvel Collins, Carvel Collins was the Faulkner Scholar.

25:03.582 --> 25:08.066
There was really no one in the same class.

25:08.086 --> 25:10.228
And he died a few miles ago.

25:10.833 --> 25:15.801
And there were people that I met along the way.

25:15.821 --> 25:17.784
I met people in New Orleans years ago.

25:18.605 --> 25:29.301
I talked to one man who had been one of the editors of The Double Dealer down there, and talked to him on the phone in New Orleans.

25:29.321 --> 25:32.947
And he said he hadn't been feeling well.

25:33.287 --> 25:35.791
And six weeks later, he died.

25:36.272 --> 25:39.777
And he didn't know it.

25:40.212 --> 25:49.263
I don't think I'm consciously collecting people, but nevertheless, I thought, well, I'd rather get to talk to him before he died.

25:49.283 --> 25:52.667
Tell me what the collection meant to you while you had it, though.

25:52.727 --> 25:53.969
Can you put that into words?

25:54.069 --> 25:55.030
Can you express that?

25:55.370 --> 25:57.313
Oh, yeah.

25:57.333 --> 25:57.994
And it spanned.

25:58.074 --> 26:04.161
I think the collection, if you sold it, so we're talking about 40,

26:04.495 --> 26:06.838
40-plus years, right, that you enjoyed this?

26:07.058 --> 26:20.113
Okay, so I bought, I bought, tried to fill in the books, and Margie used to reassure me, don't worry, someday you'll have a marble farm, someday you'll have a... What eluded you, by the way?

26:20.133 --> 26:21.074
Did anything elude you?

26:24.558 --> 26:27.461
Those books did not come easily.

26:29.023 --> 26:31.566
Marble farm and... You got a marble farm?

26:32.120 --> 26:33.162
I ended up with two.

26:33.543 --> 26:34.024
Really?

26:34.044 --> 26:35.587
Any association copies?

26:35.607 --> 26:40.757
Yeah, one was one of those copies that he signed the first day he had them.

26:41.398 --> 26:42.560
To whom?

26:44.985 --> 26:50.575
To a lady named Sunshine Lawless, who was a lady that lived down in Mississippi.

26:51.898 --> 26:52.018
Right.

26:52.235 --> 27:21.060
she's not in blotner's biography she wasn't sunshine l-a-w-l-a-s-s l-a-w-l-e-s-s lawless just the right time a white woman or a black woman oh no a white woman the sunshine could be taken as a very curious well that christian name that was a big name don't forget in the south uh names are different you know every woman is named elizabeth sue or

27:21.260 --> 27:23.063
I mean, she has two first names.

27:23.103 --> 27:23.703
Billy Joe.

27:24.044 --> 27:30.213
Billy Joe, yeah.

27:30.233 --> 27:39.385
So, um, uh, no, I, uh, but Margie was saying, eventually, you'll have a vote on Moses, a limited vote on Moses.

27:39.406 --> 27:42.109
Eventually, you'll have... See if you're assuring you.

27:43.131 --> 27:44.753
Yeah, but...

27:45.003 --> 27:48.028
I was in the shop in 1956.

27:48.108 --> 27:51.613
I remember 1956.

27:51.994 --> 27:57.742
I remember it was the time of the Hungarian Revolt and all the other things that were happening.

27:57.762 --> 28:00.767
And I says, what can I buy?

28:00.787 --> 28:07.037
And she says, well, do you want to start buying some of the French editions?

28:07.918 --> 28:08.819
I said, I might as well.

28:08.939 --> 28:10.842
I can't buy any of those.

28:10.962 --> 28:13.947
And that's when I started buying foreign editions in 1956.

28:14.332 --> 28:17.455
The French edition says limited edition.

28:17.475 --> 28:23.121
And then gradually, oh God, you know, all that foreign stuff.

28:23.602 --> 28:24.523
It was fun.

28:24.563 --> 28:25.864
Were you obsessed though?

28:26.025 --> 28:26.645
It was fun.

28:26.685 --> 28:31.190
Well, it was a way to keep adding to the collection.

28:31.290 --> 28:32.492
What were you thinking?

28:32.532 --> 28:33.172
What did you see?

28:33.292 --> 28:35.935
Maybe it was like eating too much chocolate.

28:35.955 --> 28:38.138
You know, you feel good while you're doing it.

28:38.158 --> 28:41.681
And I had to add things to the collection.

28:41.701 --> 28:43.123
How did you enjoy it?

28:43.357 --> 29:08.655
how did that yeah well i mean did you did you read the foreign editions for instance or was that just the pleasure of ownership no the joy of ownership even to the point where uh and don't forget all through all this i find the critical stuff yeah the b items i'm buying the yale review and the virginia quarterly review and i'm buying

29:09.074 --> 29:16.972
These books that are coming out, that are studies.

29:17.514 --> 29:20.601
Did you sell it as a collection or did you sign it?

29:20.641 --> 29:27.657
I tried to sell it to a...

29:29.105 --> 29:37.438
I had a dealer who tried to sell it to an institutional collection, a library, a university library.

29:38.379 --> 29:40.322
Generically I'm speaking now.

29:40.502 --> 29:42.986
They dealt with one or two specific ones.

29:45.210 --> 29:46.872
It was fascinating.

29:46.972 --> 29:49.857
Everybody was quite contented.

29:49.937 --> 29:53.442
I would donate it for me.

29:54.451 --> 29:55.152
And L.D.

29:55.252 --> 29:58.075
has pulled the best of all possible worlds deal.

29:58.135 --> 29:59.297
I don't know if you know about it.

29:59.317 --> 30:01.019
Well, we're going down there tomorrow.

30:01.039 --> 30:01.399
Yeah, yeah.

30:01.960 --> 30:06.685
But I mean, he's sold it to get cash.

30:06.705 --> 30:09.829
He's donated quite enough to get tax relief.

30:09.849 --> 30:15.576
And he's the archivist on it, the curator.

30:15.596 --> 30:17.438
So he will get an annual...

30:17.806 --> 30:39.500
But anyway, when I was trying to sell it, the Library of Congress would have been very happy to have it donated.

30:40.141 --> 30:41.403
Well, you can't afford to do that.

30:41.423 --> 30:41.603
I can't.
