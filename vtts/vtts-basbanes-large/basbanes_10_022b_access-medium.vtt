WEBVTT

00:03.507 --> 00:09.353
I'll give you a catalog of my Melville collection.

00:09.373 --> 00:11.375
Where was that, here?

00:11.735 --> 00:13.197
That was at Yale, yeah.

00:13.357 --> 00:18.362
That was at Yale, the time of the 100th anniversary of his death in 91, and there were a lot of Melville things going on.

00:19.103 --> 00:27.231
But anyway, Harvard ended up, you know, Melville's granddaughter married Keyes Metcalf, who's the librarian at Harvard.

00:28.192 --> 00:32.316
And so a chunk of books in Melville's library went to Harvard.

00:32.903 --> 00:39.971
Another Melville granddaughter gave a chunk to New York Public, and those are the two big groups of books that were his library books.

00:39.991 --> 00:46.678
The bulk of his library was sold by his wife after he died to a Brooklyn bookseller for $150.

00:47.159 --> 00:53.285
And so books from Melville's library are out floating around.

00:53.385 --> 00:56.248
Oh, I've seen a couple of the Lilly Library, for instance.

00:56.269 --> 01:02.235
Yeah, and there's a whole book about it by a guy named Merton Seals called Melville's Reading, where Mert tried to

01:02.890 --> 01:04.292
He tracked it down two ways.

01:04.492 --> 01:10.061
One, by references in Melville's writings that made it clear he'd read a book.

01:10.081 --> 01:13.867
So, you know, he could identify a book without necessarily knowing where the book was.

01:14.568 --> 01:18.554
And then, the other way around, of finding a book that had Melville's notes in it.

01:18.574 --> 01:26.286
And because the bulk of the library was just dispersed in the trade, important books have continued to turn up over time.

01:26.646 --> 01:28.188
There were two in the Garden Library.

01:28.349 --> 01:31.193
There was Melville's Milton, which

01:31.544 --> 01:45.001
I underbid, in which she ended up at Princeton, which Steve Weissman bought on behalf of Princeton, which actually had, um, Haven had paid some incredible, I think Haven paid $100,000 for it.

01:45.342 --> 01:48.346
It went for $55,000, I think, at the garden, but you can check that.

01:49.087 --> 01:56.396
And then Haven had, um, Mel Vilstante, which had showed up, you know, kind of at the height of his collecting.

01:56.636 --> 01:59.019
He bought, and he wouldn't let anybody look at.

02:00.501 --> 02:01.062
And, um,

02:01.565 --> 02:02.888
I bought it there.

02:03.630 --> 02:08.282
And there is no book I own of my collections that has been more looked at by scholars.

02:08.502 --> 02:12.873
Probably 20 different Melville scholars have come to look at that book.

02:12.913 --> 02:16.823
In fact, we got an email this morning from a guy who's writing his dissertation on Melville and Dante.

02:17.410 --> 02:46.793
who i had to send an email back to this morning saying he's welcome to come look at it how much does he how much does he reveal himself he must obviously reveal quite a bit of himself well it's it's hard to say i mean this is where i don't feel like a scholar at all i mean i just i'm happy to be the aider and the better of these guys i mean if you get the amount of melville criticism and its its density um in terms of being post-modern criticism as far as i'm concerned is huge and you know

02:47.870 --> 02:51.716
Anything you can think of, somebody's coming up with out of this stuff.

02:51.736 --> 02:54.841
And I'm very happy to just let these guys come and look at it.

02:55.001 --> 03:01.752
A lot of the annotations are in the form of underlining, marking things, sometimes triple underlining.

03:02.694 --> 03:05.879
Well, then the trick is to find resonances in his writing.

03:06.099 --> 03:07.582
Exactly, exactly.

03:08.183 --> 03:12.229
And so, in that sense, I feel very much like the steward of the material.

03:12.249 --> 03:14.012
I'm very happy to have these people come.

03:14.465 --> 03:18.769
I mean, I've really enjoyed my association with the Melville scholarly world.

03:19.410 --> 03:21.772
They all love me, because I'll let them look at the stuff.

03:21.832 --> 03:25.716
I mean, you know, it's a choice of somebody like me or somebody like Amour.

03:26.377 --> 03:27.198
Who keeps on the phone.

03:27.218 --> 03:28.239
Take me every time, you know.

03:28.259 --> 03:31.322
I mean, I'm happy to, you know, have them come.

03:31.402 --> 03:32.443
I enjoy their company.

03:32.463 --> 03:34.745
They're nice folks, you know.

03:35.846 --> 03:37.468
So, when did this start?

03:38.429 --> 03:39.330
Melville?

03:39.350 --> 03:42.733
I started collecting Melville in, like,

03:44.401 --> 04:03.613
How do you walk that line that so many booksellers say is a very fine one, separating, you know, the bookseller from... Well, in that case, it was a little easier for me because... It wasn't what I was doing.

04:03.693 --> 04:05.075
I mean, my company deals in that.

04:05.135 --> 04:06.838
Harry Halliday runs the literary part of it.

04:06.858 --> 04:10.003
But he was one author.

04:10.928 --> 04:27.520
It was, you know, what I was most interested in, too, were not, although I've got all the Melville first editions, was manuscript material, these books from this library, and so forth, which, when I started this, people said, you'll never be able to put together a collection that means anything.

04:27.540 --> 04:28.381
It's far too late.

04:28.501 --> 04:30.405
Well, I did, though.

04:30.824 --> 04:33.808
I gather it's still a growing collection, right?

04:33.828 --> 04:34.528
Well, not really.

04:34.588 --> 04:38.693
I mean, I've been too involved in the color plate books, and all my money's going into color plate books.

04:38.713 --> 04:40.335
So you're collecting color plate books?

04:40.355 --> 04:41.637
American color plate books, yeah.

04:41.657 --> 04:44.440
So two major collections, or is there another one?

04:44.460 --> 04:44.780
Oh, no.

04:44.860 --> 04:49.386
I bought a major collection of Robert Graves and Siegfried Sassou and Overlone Poets, which I have.

04:49.406 --> 04:53.991
In fact, a chunk of that was just on an exhibit at the British Art Center at Yale.

04:54.932 --> 04:59.818
And so I'll give you an exhibition catalog on that till then.

05:00.406 --> 05:02.288
You're a major collector in your own right.

05:02.749 --> 05:05.752
Yeah, I am, as a matter of fact.

05:05.853 --> 05:11.439
And do you act as your own bookseller, or do you not rely like a lawyer?

05:12.120 --> 05:14.543
Oh, no, I mean, of course I do, yeah.

05:14.563 --> 05:16.005
I buy the stuff myself.

05:16.045 --> 05:22.633
I mean, obviously I'm tremendously helped in forming a collection by my friendships in the trade.

05:23.875 --> 05:30.042
You know, I'm very easy to deal with, and with the things that I've been collecting, I mean, I'm willing to pay

05:30.545 --> 05:31.186
going ready.

05:32.688 --> 05:41.039
So, I've been, it's been much easier to form a collection because of that.

05:42.240 --> 05:43.862
So, there's something like the color plate books.

05:43.882 --> 05:48.748
I mean, a lot of, you know, it's generally known that I'm doing this, particularly after this.

05:49.730 --> 05:53.935
And, you know, people offer me stuff.

05:55.097 --> 05:57.700
I go around, you know, I buy books all the time.

05:57.916 --> 06:08.649
What's the black orchid of this particular, what's the rare bird that you must have, that you don't have, or do you have everything that you find?

06:08.669 --> 06:11.893
No, I mean, I've got some of the great, difficult books.

06:11.913 --> 06:22.305
I mean, the biggest and most, and one of the more difficult books is the Bean, the Circle and Bean edition of Audubon, the big, the American chromolithographic reprint of the Virgin America.

06:22.886 --> 06:23.687
I do have that.

06:24.359 --> 06:28.906
I don't have the American edition of Calvin's North American Indian Portfolio.

06:28.926 --> 06:32.912
That's one of the great rarities, one of the most expensive books.

06:32.932 --> 06:35.876
And you're actively searching for it, I gather.

06:35.896 --> 06:36.257
Yeah.

06:36.537 --> 06:41.444
I mean, there's one actually coming up in this sale, but I'm going to be bidding on it per customer.

06:42.386 --> 06:46.532
And so how do you, that's a delicate situation, or maybe it's not.

06:46.692 --> 06:48.835
It's the kind of thing maybe you'd like to have for yourself.

06:49.196 --> 06:50.458
I would like to have for myself.

06:50.898 --> 06:54.163
There's a limit to what I could pay, which is a high limit.

06:54.447 --> 07:10.172
In this case... Now, this is a hypothetical, because I don't want you to talk about somebody you're representing, but let's say the customer's limit is here, so we reach that limit, but Bill reaches it.

07:10.192 --> 07:11.414
What's the limit is up here?

07:11.555 --> 07:13.738
Would you keep going and, I guess, secure it for yourself?

07:13.758 --> 07:21.130
In this case, I knew this is somebody I know well, somebody I've done business with for a long time, and somebody who's richer than I am.

07:22.122 --> 07:25.246
And he told me a long time ago this was a book he wanted.

07:25.746 --> 07:29.470
And so, you know, when I knew that the Siebert Sale was going to take place, I called him up.

07:29.490 --> 07:30.572
This was last November.

07:30.592 --> 07:32.374
And I said, look, there's going to be an American Catalan.

07:33.615 --> 07:35.717
And you know I'm doing this color plate collection.

07:35.798 --> 07:37.800
And it's a book I'd very much like to have.

07:38.240 --> 07:39.121
But I know you want it.

07:39.682 --> 07:45.108
And all I want you to do is say to me that you'll pay more for it than I would.

07:45.128 --> 07:48.632
And if you would, I'll do your bid.

07:48.672 --> 07:51.235
And, you know, he...

07:51.451 --> 07:54.316
We talked the numbers, and, you know, he was willing to do it.

07:54.356 --> 07:56.599
And I said, fine, you know, I mean, you're willing to pay what I am.

07:56.679 --> 07:58.262
You know, I'll do your bid.

07:58.302 --> 08:03.290
But on the other hand, if I'd been willing to pay more than he was, I would have rather expected it.

08:03.390 --> 08:11.082
And in his case, I think if I, you know, if he wasn't willing to pay what I was willing to pay, I think he would have said, you go for it.

08:11.102 --> 08:18.133
So, you know, I haven't really had a conflict in dealing with the color plate book stuff.

08:18.282 --> 08:22.649
That's a perfect example right there of how you handle it, I guess.

08:22.949 --> 08:23.069
Yeah.

08:23.390 --> 08:26.955
What would you estimate the size of the stock is here?

08:27.376 --> 08:27.897
Oh, gosh.

08:27.937 --> 08:41.978
We've probably got right now about 11,000 catalog pieces of Americana, probably 20,000 catalog pieces of literature, and we occupied

08:42.464 --> 08:43.465
two buildings here.

08:43.546 --> 08:44.988
I'll give you a tour in a little bit.

08:45.108 --> 08:46.850
I don't know if you got a tour the last time.

08:46.891 --> 08:48.032
No, I didn't, actually.

08:48.072 --> 08:55.163
We've got two buildings here with probably about half a mile of shelving in them, a lot of which is reference material.

08:56.144 --> 09:00.671
And then my warehouse out in Hamden, I've got another mile and a half of shelving.

09:01.432 --> 09:07.721
So we have at least as many books, again, that are uncataloged, although that tends to be some of them we never will catalog.

09:07.801 --> 09:10.986
I mean, it's just stuff that came in with collections.

09:11.236 --> 09:17.385
stuff that we're going to get rid of, I mean, stuff that we're feeding into the various small auctions, or we're wholesaling off to people.

09:17.405 --> 09:19.768
It's, you know, it's more used book shelf stock.

09:19.829 --> 09:26.618
It's just, you know, not something that we can affordably catalog and put up.

09:26.759 --> 09:29.402
It's much more, you know, kind of used book stuff.

09:29.423 --> 09:33.929
Now, you don't have a sign, this is not an open, do you regard this as an open shop?

09:34.370 --> 09:36.833
No, we're by appointment, or by appointment.

09:36.853 --> 09:40.078
And that's, as much as anything,

09:40.227 --> 09:42.310
just because of the physical layout here.

09:42.811 --> 09:55.272
You know, because we're on different floors and different levels, and everybody's working at their workstations, if somebody comes to, people, most people who come to see us are people we know well, and we're happy to give them the run of the place.

09:55.672 --> 09:57.315
But if we don't know them, we have to watch them.

09:57.375 --> 10:00.139
I mean, it's, I'm afraid, just the way it is.

10:00.400 --> 10:04.767
I mean, I've had, I've had books stolen from me, and

10:05.641 --> 10:08.646
If you don't know somebody, you can't just leave them alone.

10:08.766 --> 10:12.512
I think the nature of your business, too, is that it is developing relationships.

10:12.872 --> 10:13.433
Absolutely.

10:13.493 --> 10:16.097
It's not an over-the-transom kind of a business that you run.

10:16.137 --> 10:23.809
You know, it's a truism of all small businesses that 20% of your customers are 80% of your business.

10:25.171 --> 10:28.476
One of my customers told me that a long time ago, and

10:28.777 --> 10:32.502
I said, oh, that's not true, and then I went and looked, and it was true.

10:32.562 --> 10:34.966
That's the hermitation thing.

10:35.006 --> 10:36.488
Squeeze it down to the 20 or 30.

10:36.648 --> 10:42.817
Yeah, well, and that really is what it comes down to, I think for most, I think for just about everybody.

10:43.558 --> 10:51.329
I mean, at any given time, probably half of my business has been my top ten customers.

10:51.349 --> 10:53.291
That top ten has changed.

10:53.812 --> 10:58.699
I mean, there's very seldom been a year when

10:59.185 --> 11:01.547
the top customer was the same customer as the year before.

11:02.568 --> 11:16.702
I mean, there are people who were long-term averages, there are people who've kind of come and gone for one reason or another, or because there was some single big sale to somebody that they came out very high up in the ratings because of a single sale.

11:17.383 --> 11:24.990
But, by and large, I think every one of the big rare book firms, I would argue, is

11:25.207 --> 11:27.950
basically operating to deal with a couple dozen people.

11:28.531 --> 11:32.815
Now, you're basically, you're doing a lot of business on the web, aren't you?

11:32.835 --> 11:39.482
We are doing a lot of business on the web, although in terms of our overall cash volume, it's not that big.

11:39.502 --> 11:46.370
It's more, and I know this is true of Lou, of Heritage, because Lou and I have specifically, you know, had a conversation about this.

11:47.451 --> 11:51.956
It's a lot of invoices, but a relatively small average invoice.

11:52.576 --> 11:53.998
I mean, it's great in the sense

11:54.130 --> 11:58.977
for both of us that we're selling stuff that we view as sub-catalog.

11:59.617 --> 12:03.062
You know, we don't want to put items that inexpensive in catalogs.

12:03.763 --> 12:05.185
Because catalogs are expensive, right?

12:05.205 --> 12:06.026
Yeah, exactly.

12:06.046 --> 12:07.248
So there's this real cost.

12:07.568 --> 12:10.492
You guys, you have yours printed, I think.

12:10.512 --> 12:10.712
Yeah.

12:10.913 --> 12:11.654
Staying out press?

12:11.674 --> 12:13.216
Oh, no, no, no, no.

12:13.256 --> 12:13.736
Didn't you do that?

12:13.756 --> 12:15.619
There's a local printer here.

12:15.639 --> 12:18.783
It's a nice, very high-quality job.

12:18.803 --> 12:19.624
They do a nice job.

12:19.644 --> 12:20.866
They're not terribly expensive.

12:20.886 --> 12:22.348
But still, there's a,

12:22.868 --> 12:25.811
you know, a real cost of publishing something in a catalog.

12:25.851 --> 12:27.652
Not to mention the work that goes into it.

12:27.953 --> 12:31.736
By the way, tell me what your time constraints are.

12:31.756 --> 12:34.198
Yeah, well, we can also have some lunch if you'd like to have lunch.

12:34.218 --> 12:34.979
Sure, whatever.

12:36.360 --> 12:38.823
But, I mean, if you have to break or anything like that, let me know.

12:40.104 --> 12:43.927
The importance of the catalog and the writing of the descriptions, do you write most of the descriptions?

12:44.027 --> 12:48.712
These days, most of the descriptions are written by Joe Bray, who works for me.

12:48.732 --> 12:49.953
How do you spell?

12:50.033 --> 12:51.274
B-R-A-Y.

12:51.594 --> 12:52.555
But we've got it.

12:52.703 --> 12:57.791
You know, we've got a big... I have as many records of things that have been sold as things that are live.

12:58.472 --> 13:05.462
So there are a lot of books, you know, that are the standard books in our field, that when they come back into our hands, we don't have to write any description.

13:05.482 --> 13:08.627
I mean, you have to change the physical description of the book.

13:08.647 --> 13:14.376
But the abstract, the discussion of what the book's about and why it's important and what's in it, is insane.

13:15.137 --> 13:21.647
So cataloging gets ever more efficient for us because we only kept to catalog, really, the new books.

13:22.083 --> 13:26.088
And that's the beauty of a computer, too.

13:26.128 --> 13:27.690
You do have a database of these things.

13:28.411 --> 13:28.811
Yeah.

13:28.871 --> 13:36.340
So, I mean, I've got something like 25,000 records from my Americana database, but I've only got about 11,000 live ones.

13:36.981 --> 13:37.622
Live meaning?

13:38.303 --> 13:41.647
Meaning that we've got copies for sale, and the others are sold records.

13:42.107 --> 13:48.094
But, you know, I mean, typically these days, well, I'd look at what I bought at the Siebert sale.

13:48.114 --> 13:52.039
Half of what we bought at the Siebert sale we'd had copies of before.

13:52.255 --> 13:58.763
It's just a matter of moving it from the sold file and changing the physical description of the actual copy in your catalog.

13:58.784 --> 14:09.778
The importance of researching items on those rare occasions where it's something you don't know, determining the significance of an item.

14:09.818 --> 14:13.723
I mean, I wonder how many things there are that you don't know in Americana.

14:14.007 --> 14:17.050
Well, that's the fun thing about the book business.

14:17.070 --> 14:18.451
You keep finding things you don't know.

14:18.871 --> 14:23.916
Or you're coming with books you've never seen before, you've never focused on.

14:24.216 --> 14:30.562
And there's no better way to find things out than to kind of have an object in view.

14:31.102 --> 14:35.486
It's often difficult, at least for me, to abstractly learn things.

14:35.506 --> 14:41.652
I mean, you can sit there and they can read a bibliography, but if you've got things and you've got to find out about them,

14:42.037 --> 14:47.102
understand all about them and they're complicated, then that's when you can really learn them.

14:47.182 --> 14:54.388
You made a lot of news when you bought the Declaration of Independence, and so you've had a couple of really, I think you handled it.

14:54.408 --> 14:56.390
Louisiana Purchase Proclamation, you probably think.

14:56.410 --> 14:58.452
I'm sorry, Louisiana Purchase Proclamation.

14:59.012 --> 15:00.654
Didn't you do a Columbus Letter once?

15:00.734 --> 15:05.718
I handled two of the three Columbus Letters that came through in 1992.

15:05.758 --> 15:09.782
So these make news, but personally, one of the some of the more exciting

15:11.534 --> 15:34.437
Oh, of recent things, I just sold to the Library of Congress, and it's going to be one of their, you know, things, acquisitions for their 200th anniversary, a group of photographs that were taken by the British Northwest Boundary Commission in the course of surveying the boundary.

15:35.007 --> 15:37.631
This is the first photograph taken in the Pacific Northwest.

15:37.651 --> 15:39.654
This is the first exploration photograph there.

15:39.674 --> 15:41.817
This is 1859, 60, 61.

15:41.837 --> 15:44.320
It's only 20 years after the photography.

15:44.340 --> 15:50.469
Surveying out in western, along the Washington, but now the Washington border, out to the Rocky Mountains.

15:51.371 --> 15:55.176
Those turned up in a Sotheby's book sale in London.

15:55.677 --> 15:59.422
Very out of context, completely underdescribed.

15:59.562 --> 16:00.884
There are a couple other sets.

16:01.505 --> 16:02.787
None of them exactly the same.

16:03.577 --> 16:06.620
One that was taken by the Royal Engineers.

16:06.640 --> 16:08.582
The Royal Engineers have a set in their archives.

16:09.343 --> 16:15.849
All the Royal Engineers were trained in photography at what's now the Victoria and Albert, then the South Kensington Museum.

16:16.270 --> 16:17.051
They've got a set.

16:17.992 --> 16:21.375
Yale has a set that was in the papers of one of the American boundary commissioners.

16:22.076 --> 16:25.359
But this set was evidently belonged to one of the officers on the survey.

16:25.940 --> 16:27.681
And that was an amazing thing.

16:27.742 --> 16:28.963
And the NLC didn't have it?

16:29.864 --> 16:30.064
No.

16:30.384 --> 16:32.166
Those were the known sets, those three.

16:32.534 --> 16:35.577
And this is, you know, surveying one of the boundaries of the United States.

16:35.597 --> 16:40.822
So that's going to be one of LCU's big things coming up.

16:40.842 --> 16:41.703
How do you feel with that?

16:42.083 --> 16:43.605
Do you still get that?

16:44.125 --> 16:46.167
Oh, I mean, it's terrifically exciting.

16:46.607 --> 16:53.354
A whole great bunch of Stephen F. Austin letters showed up about a year and a half ago in New Orleans.

16:53.374 --> 16:56.477
We were able to buy all those, and we sold those to a private collector.

16:57.097 --> 17:00.921
I mean, that was terrific material to handle.

17:02.909 --> 17:17.268
In books, actually, one of the most exciting things I've handled when I think about this is something I saw of Bill Scheide, which is really the first printed account of Indians on the American mainland.

17:17.529 --> 17:26.501
It's a little book that describes the coasting voyage of Yucatan that preceded Cortez by a guy named Grave, Wanda Gravea.

17:27.522 --> 17:31.127
And there are two known copies of this pamphlet.

17:31.462 --> 17:37.112
And that turned up in a German sale, I forget which house, stuck in there.

17:37.132 --> 17:39.837
It wasn't in the Americana or the travel section.

17:39.897 --> 17:41.820
It was in the Hult of Druka section.

17:41.860 --> 17:43.223
You were somebody in your staff.

17:43.563 --> 17:43.824
I did.

17:44.365 --> 17:44.645
I did.

17:45.186 --> 17:46.629
So everything that comes in, you go through.

17:46.649 --> 17:48.131
Oh, I buy everything.

17:49.253 --> 17:51.357
Every catalog, every sale.

17:51.377 --> 17:52.439
Yeah, absolutely.

17:52.519 --> 17:55.444
I mean, I buy everything we buy.

17:55.795 --> 17:57.837
I catalog the most important things.

17:57.917 --> 18:02.382
You buy everything from William Reese Company, every book that enters here.

18:02.622 --> 18:06.446
This is not something you delegate to anybody else.

18:06.466 --> 18:06.666
No.

18:07.107 --> 18:08.748
I mean, it goes back to what I said.

18:08.768 --> 18:12.332
I mean, buying books is the key to the book business.

18:12.352 --> 18:17.538
Once you have good books, these days it's not that hard to sell them.

18:17.978 --> 18:22.943
It's buying them and knowing what to price them, and therefore knowing what you can pay for them.

18:23.384 --> 18:24.705
That's the key to the book business.

18:25.057 --> 18:28.061
I devote more time to buying books than I do to selling books.

18:30.765 --> 18:31.607
That's fascinating.

18:32.147 --> 18:38.657
Well, I think you'd find, I mean, if you pose that question to, you know, my peers, I think they'd say the same thing.

18:38.877 --> 18:40.720
And determining value, obviously.

18:40.760 --> 18:41.341
Yeah.

18:41.361 --> 18:42.903
Without benefit of an auction.

18:43.104 --> 18:48.311
Yeah, I mean, an auction... See, this is the next two weeks of, this is the rest of the month auction.

18:48.692 --> 18:49.213
Compile.

18:49.233 --> 18:49.393
Yeah.

18:49.812 --> 18:52.775
And that's just what, you know, what we're currently dealing with.

18:52.795 --> 18:54.257
I mean, that's like last week.

18:54.277 --> 18:55.118
That's what we've done.

18:55.138 --> 18:56.559
They're like 20, easily.

18:56.579 --> 18:57.480
20, 25, yeah.

18:57.840 --> 19:02.505
You know, I mean, it's, so I go through everything.

19:02.525 --> 19:08.752
I mean, that's something, I mean, I tend to do that, you know, at home in the evening.

19:09.213 --> 19:12.516
But the German thing was in German, so you must be German, I gather.

19:12.716 --> 19:18.182
Well, you know, the answer to that is Lathrop Hartford was asked,

19:18.803 --> 19:44.440
uh how why uh how he could deal in incunables when he only spoke english and all the incunables were in something other than english and he said i know the word for imperfect in 17 languages so that's the quick answer to that i mean um bookseller and title page linguistics is a is a different proposition you know the it's funny you mention that because um i my

19:44.740 --> 19:47.142
Linguistic skills are very limited, sadly.

19:47.383 --> 19:52.447
I wish I'd paid more attention in Latin when I was in school, yeah.

19:52.788 --> 20:07.021
But I find you take certain things like, say, 17th century Spanish, which has changed, Spanish has changed more from the 17th century to now than, say, English has changed from Elizabethan times to now.

20:07.702 --> 20:11.946
Much greater change in the language, the way the written language looks.

20:12.398 --> 20:24.248
People who are quite good in modern Spanish, and I'm only barely able to read modern Spanish, and then only somewhat, have a hard time reading this stuff.

20:24.268 --> 20:41.123
But if you know the forms and formats that things are done in, or the kinds of things you're typically dealing with, royal decrees, these different administrative and bureaucratic forms, if you know that stuff, you're more quickly able to tell what the thing is than if you can read it.

20:41.963 --> 20:44.846
Look at some of this stuff.

20:44.886 --> 20:52.475
What I'm now showing them are, these are 17th century French administrative documents.

20:52.575 --> 20:57.261
Okay, so these things are, you know, they're different kinds.

20:57.281 --> 20:59.103
Some are arrests.

20:59.944 --> 21:03.768
Some of them are treaties.

21:05.230 --> 21:08.494
Some of them, they have all these different catchphrases.

21:08.693 --> 21:16.323
If you know what the catchphrases are, you kind of immediately know where the document's headed, what it's about.

21:17.986 --> 21:19.508
This is dated 1679.

21:19.668 --> 21:22.912
This is arrested by the Constitution.

21:23.433 --> 21:23.934
Yeah.

21:24.334 --> 21:35.950
So this is a decree from the king's council, which is different than a proclamation by the king or different than something like this,

21:36.453 --> 21:38.656
which is this, for example.

21:38.716 --> 21:40.278
French Duties and American Tobacco.

21:40.298 --> 21:41.759
I was wondering where the Americana came in.

21:41.839 --> 21:42.140
Right.

21:42.781 --> 21:49.709
This is, you know, the arguments that the negotiators are putting on the table at the Treaty of Utrecht.

21:49.729 --> 21:56.617
The Americana connection here is that lots of sugar islands in the Caribbean changed hands at the Treaty of Utrecht.

21:57.398 --> 22:01.563
So where do you find things like this?

22:01.583 --> 22:04.266
You show this to somebody, you know, to somebody who's

22:04.432 --> 22:09.478
good reader of French, and they'll toil through the 17th century French trying to figure out what it is.

22:09.918 --> 22:15.525
I can immediately tell you what it's about, you know, because I know the historical background, and I know what's going on here.

22:16.005 --> 22:18.248
The Treaty of Utrecht, there's a lot of hard negotiation.

22:18.288 --> 22:22.673
The French are actually in a bad position because they've kind of gotten their asses kicked in various places.

22:23.133 --> 22:26.717
They're fighting to keep a hold of whatever they can, and they want to get back their sugar islands.

22:26.737 --> 22:27.939
The English should take it away from them.

22:28.720 --> 22:30.522
Well, that's bringing something to that.

22:31.703 --> 22:31.823
That's

22:32.326 --> 22:35.589
what you spent the last 30 years, or however many years it is.

22:38.551 --> 22:40.153
But that's what any good book dealer is doing.

22:40.173 --> 22:48.740
They're taking their built-up body of knowledge and applying it, and then they're taking the opportunity to build... To give a context.

22:48.800 --> 22:51.162
To build more on the context.

22:52.003 --> 22:58.449
And so every opportunity they have to handle something new is going to add to the context.

22:58.709 --> 23:01.371
So if I'm a collector of what?

23:02.887 --> 23:05.971
What kind of collective would be interested in these French documents?

23:06.071 --> 23:13.600
Well, if you were interested in the history of, you could be interested in the history of European diplomacy.

23:13.640 --> 23:16.343
You could be interested in the history of the Caribbean.

23:16.964 --> 23:29.519
You could be interested in something like these things, quite often slavery, because many of these things involve the slave trade because they involve the sugarology.

23:29.539 --> 23:32.843
You could be interested in economics.

23:33.498 --> 23:38.344
This is an ordinance that has to do with duties on sugar.

23:39.346 --> 23:42.250
So that relates to the Caribbean.

23:42.270 --> 23:43.531
It relates to the slave trade.

23:43.591 --> 23:48.878
It relates to the economics of the sugar business, which is, of course, a very important thing at that point.

23:48.958 --> 23:52.483
And when it says, what does that mean?

23:52.703 --> 23:55.367
So it's a decree by the Council of State.

23:56.428 --> 23:59.713
So basically, the King's Council has met.

23:59.733 --> 24:01.355
They're making a specific decree.

24:01.915 --> 24:03.117
I didn't get it.

24:04.058 --> 24:10.486
In this point, it looks like they're giving one man some kind of specific dispensation.

24:12.088 --> 24:15.132
They're giving this guy a break on his sugar duties or something like that.

24:20.578 --> 24:31.652
So, you know, material like this can look fairly dense, and this is where book dealers can really do their work.

24:31.953 --> 24:36.757
you can explain the importance of these things and how they fit into a context.

24:37.838 --> 24:40.260
But, yeah, my point is, so I'm here and I collect this stuff.

24:41.121 --> 24:52.570
You're going to take it upon yourself to explain to me why this is a very important document and why it's, why I should be taken out by a checkbook and paying whatever.

24:52.610 --> 24:53.411
Exactly.

24:53.711 --> 24:56.874
And I'm doing that even with things less ephemeral than this.

24:56.954 --> 25:01.858
I mean, what, if you're collecting American travel books, well, what are the ones that are

25:02.142 --> 25:17.379
the significant ones, the ones that are well written, that are interesting, that break new ground, that the first person to go someplace, or first person to describe someplace, versus ones that are more run-of-the-mill.

25:18.040 --> 25:21.524
And of course, which ones are rare, which ones aren't.

25:22.325 --> 25:31.575
In this case, with Siebert, with my best customers, and I'm working with them, they're saying to me, these guys are going to spend a lot of money here.

25:32.264 --> 25:39.535
Their first question to me generally is, Bill, you know what I collect, you know what I'm most interested in.

25:39.995 --> 25:44.562
What are the books that I'm most interested in here that I'm not going to get another chance at?

25:46.384 --> 25:49.509
Because ultimately they do have finite budgets, even though they're big ones.

25:49.769 --> 25:51.231
Excuse me, Bill, are you going to need lunch?

25:52.033 --> 25:52.874
Would you like a sandwich?

25:52.914 --> 25:53.595
Sure.

25:53.615 --> 25:55.858
Yeah, we'll get a sandwich, Joe.

25:55.878 --> 25:57.000
What would you like?

25:58.222 --> 26:01.326
What kind of... We got anything you can think of.

26:02.504 --> 26:21.804
So, I mean, what they're saying to me in a situation like that is, okay, look, you know, I'm willing to spend a half million bucks at the secret sale, but I want to spend that money on stuff that is the most important to my collection that I'm not going to have another chance at, you know.

26:22.125 --> 26:25.388
If we're going to have another chance at it, well, let's worry about that later, you know.

26:25.588 --> 26:30.233
What do I have to buy now that I'm not going to get another chance at?

26:30.483 --> 26:32.605
And then what are we going to have to pay?

26:32.625 --> 26:39.871
So they ask you this, and you must have some sense of the things that aren't going to be available.

26:39.891 --> 26:40.552
So, yeah.

26:40.592 --> 26:52.403
So, I mean, what I really bring to the table in working for somebody at something like Seaver is that I was able to, I was saying to them, okay, this is what's important to you, and this is what it's going to cost you.

26:52.503 --> 26:58.228
You know, we've got to figure out, and of course, in a sale like Seaver, you've got to think in terms of the flow of the sale, too.

26:58.883 --> 27:02.827
You know, the thing you want the most is the last lot in the sale.

27:03.548 --> 27:06.891
It's a lot more complicated than the thing you want the most is the first lot in the sale, you know?

27:07.632 --> 27:13.017
And so I'm bringing all that context there.

27:13.417 --> 27:20.404
And I'm going, I mean, I've spent, I guess at this point, five full days down at Sotheby's with people looking at stuff.

27:20.424 --> 27:21.665
So you bring your clients in.

27:21.946 --> 27:23.047
Yeah.

27:23.247 --> 27:24.908
And we're looking at things.

27:24.928 --> 27:25.629
They're pulling it off.

27:25.649 --> 27:27.591
They're saying, well, tell me about this book.

27:28.313 --> 27:30.835
And I'm not just saying, well, it's a pretty book.

27:31.056 --> 27:35.900
I'm saying, you know, look, you know, this is the auction copy of this book.

27:36.200 --> 27:41.505
But I can tell you, you know, two copies have changed hands privately since the last auction record.

27:41.786 --> 27:44.989
And they went for this and this.

27:45.009 --> 27:47.711
And this copy is almost certainly going to go for more than that.

27:48.152 --> 27:58.101
So if you want this book, you're going to have to be thinking in terms of spending, you know, $50,000 instead of $15,000 to $20,000, it says in the estimate.

27:58.823 --> 28:16.319
And, I mean, that's why, you know, quite frankly, we did so well in the first Siebert sale, that I was able to get, I was able to really give my clients what turned out to be a very accurate idea of what they were really going to have to spend, and they were able to concentrate their fire.

28:16.940 --> 28:26.569
Instead of, like, having lots of bits that didn't make it all across the sale, they focused on what they really wanted, and they knew what they were going to have to pay.

28:27.140 --> 28:28.762
And I was right most of the time.

28:28.782 --> 28:37.493
And disregarding the range of estimates that they... Yeah, I mean, the range of estimates, the estimates were very erratic, very, very erratic.

28:37.513 --> 28:41.699
But you also know who else is out there who may be interested in the same... Sure.

28:42.300 --> 28:48.087
And, you know, there are going to be cases where it's really going to be two people, and if you have a sense of what the other person's going to do.

28:48.988 --> 28:56.438
Whereas one of the... some of the competition, I think, was operating off the estimates because they didn't have

28:56.671 --> 28:58.072
and form depth of knowledge.

28:59.494 --> 29:01.216
And they figured, well, we'll spend a lot of money.

29:01.256 --> 29:03.518
We'll spend double the high estimate.

29:03.538 --> 29:09.965
Well, double the high estimate wasn't necessarily, sometimes that was too much, and sometimes it wasn't enough, you know?

29:10.065 --> 29:12.828
And then there's you never know factors, you know?

29:12.848 --> 29:18.734
I mean, I saw 25 Italian bankers walk into Christie's that day to buy the Leonardo.

29:18.774 --> 29:19.534
Right, yeah.

29:19.554 --> 29:24.940
And they figured, okay, I saw Lou Weinstein the day before, and he said, I figure it's 11 million.

29:25.358 --> 29:25.858
Yeah.

29:26.179 --> 29:29.242
Well, but nobody counted on Bill Gates.

29:29.262 --> 29:29.542
Yeah.

29:29.682 --> 29:30.062
Oh, sure.

29:31.704 --> 29:32.985
And that threw everything out.

29:33.065 --> 29:36.468
There was somebody else who just came in and, you know, said, well, fine.

29:36.628 --> 29:39.231
You can never know till you get there.

29:39.271 --> 29:44.536
I mean, you know, when I was arranging credit terms with Sotheby's for the sale, they said, how much are you going to spend?

29:44.596 --> 29:47.098
And I said, if I knew how much I was going to spend, it wouldn't be an auction.

29:47.759 --> 29:48.039
I mean.

29:48.639 --> 29:49.760
Do you enjoy this?

29:49.841 --> 29:52.983
Do you have this kind of competition of the auction?

29:53.344 --> 29:53.644
I mean,

29:54.046 --> 29:59.632
Not as much as I enjoy straight book selling.

30:00.092 --> 30:09.041
I mean, I much more enjoy finding things, being able to catalog them and explain them, and selling them to the right person.

30:09.061 --> 30:09.862
I enjoy that more.

30:10.803 --> 30:13.306
I do enjoy the auction stuff, though.

30:13.326 --> 30:21.454
I mean, it's, you know, because in this case it's so much great stuff, a very important collection.

30:22.767 --> 30:24.489
But it's a huge amount of work.

30:24.689 --> 30:45.535
I mean, if you're going to, I mean, I figured part one of the Siebert sale, I probably devoted a solid month, scattered over a long period of time, you know, building through a crescendo around the sale, and then continuing after the sale, because believe me, you know, you're going to try to pick up 246 watts from Sotheby's

30:45.970 --> 30:51.037
and get them back here, and then get it all invoiced out and off to people and everything.

30:51.478 --> 30:53.361
That was a lot of money that's in play here.

30:53.401 --> 30:55.123
Yeah, that was a lot of work too.

30:55.544 --> 31:13.210
So I devoted probably a solid month of work to Siebert I. I think Siebert II will be a little less because some of the work of Siebert II is not in Siebert I. And some of the people I'm working with, it's kind of easier this time because we've just, you know, we've been through it together.

31:13.831 --> 31:34.111
You mentioned earlier three booksellers who I've interviewed for this look on bookselling, Steve Weissman and Barney Rosenthal and Fred Schreiber, and it's interesting, each of those three, and Steve is interesting because particularly interesting, he's an American who's now, you know, a Brit, so to speak.

31:34.131 --> 31:38.015
And each of these guys has said that there is a European tradition in bookselling.

31:38.376 --> 31:39.236
Yes.

31:39.256 --> 31:43.821
And I guess the subtext to that is it's kind of a scholarly

31:44.037 --> 31:46.221
Do you subscribe to that?

31:48.124 --> 31:52.491
Would you subscribe to the view that there is a European tradition as opposed to an American tradition?

31:53.533 --> 31:57.841
And if so, where do you find yourself, or do you represent an American tradition?

31:58.161 --> 32:02.488
I guess the American tradition is just get it done, don't worry about it.

32:02.509 --> 32:07.497
No, I think that's right.

32:07.696 --> 32:25.372
The American book trade, I think, benefited terrifically from the influx of the Europeans who came here as exiles or refugees in the 30s and 40s, and who became some of the most successful dealers and some of the most interesting dealers.

32:25.392 --> 32:31.578
And I think that did it a lot to raise scholarly standards in the American book world.

32:32.379 --> 32:35.762
And I do think that

32:36.687 --> 32:41.071
the European tradition is a more scholarly one.

32:41.091 --> 32:48.858
At this point, the book trade at the highest level is so international that I don't know that you can make those distinctions anymore.

32:49.459 --> 33:00.368
I mean, Steve, I always thought of Steve when he was in this country as the best bookseller in the United States, and now he's not here anymore.

33:01.549 --> 33:04.332
And, you know, there was never any question in my mind that

33:04.463 --> 33:06.968
And you're not the first person to say that to me, by the way.

33:06.988 --> 33:08.170
Yeah.

33:08.611 --> 33:25.324
And, you know, I've always admired the way Steve did business, and, you know, I wouldn't say I've modeled myself on him by any means, but he and I certainly think in very similar tracks about what a bookseller ought to do and how a bookseller ought to do it.

33:25.608 --> 33:27.971
It's more than selling books, isn't it?

33:28.052 --> 33:30.034
It's not so obvious, but I think we should state that.

33:30.094 --> 33:40.630
Steve, of course, has always been the grandmaster of understatement, and nobody ever sold more books while pretending he couldn't care less than Steve.

33:41.872 --> 33:49.843
I mean, I knew people who would tell me, collectors who would tell me, you know, they'd just be driven crazy because they'd keep waiting for Steve to try to sell them something, and he never would, you know?

33:50.347 --> 33:53.530
And then finally they'd say, well, he wanted to buy it.

33:53.590 --> 33:57.153
He'd look kind of mildly displeased and say, oh, okay.

33:57.273 --> 34:07.943
And, of course, Steve wants to sell books as much as anybody, but he really has that down to an arc, you know, kind of not really caring whether you buy it or not.

34:07.963 --> 34:13.769
Well, he has gotten some of that British way of doing things.

34:13.829 --> 34:19.594
Right, but Steve actually is far more hardworking than most of his colleagues.

34:20.030 --> 34:45.718
I love the British book trade, and I've spent a lot of time in England, and some of my best friends are British booksellers, but I would say the British trade approaches selling books with the kind of discipline, say, that Steve or I bring to it, in terms of, you know, pursuing options to buy and in terms of cataloging and stuff like that.

34:46.699 --> 34:49.682
They'd much rather go out to lunch for a couple hours

34:49.949 --> 34:55.614
And if you know any French books out there, they really would much rather go out to lunch for a much longer period of time.

34:56.395 --> 35:09.328
Briefly, we mentioned the Internet, but you still feel that you have to handle the goods, even though so many people will buy a thing out of the catalog, it's still essential to get that book.

35:09.348 --> 35:15.694
Sure, well, the higher up the price ladder you go, the more... And I guess I'm looking for trends, you know, down the line.

35:15.714 --> 35:17.155
Yeah, I mean, I don't think...

35:18.957 --> 35:25.707
one will ever be able to build big customers and sell expensive books without a lot of real personal contact.

35:25.727 --> 35:27.349
And it doesn't necessarily have to be face to face.

35:27.369 --> 35:33.478
There are a lot of options for personal contact these days in terms of the telephone and email and a variety of other things.

35:33.958 --> 35:39.226
I mean, my best customers I don't see very often face to face.

35:39.306 --> 35:41.830
I do spend a lot of time talking to them on the telephone.

35:42.951 --> 35:45.555
I think that when you start

35:45.957 --> 36:03.614
getting into five, when you get over five figures and as you head north of that, whatever you're selling, it doesn't have to be books, confidence in the seller, the buyer's confidence in the seller becomes more and more of an issue.

36:03.674 --> 36:15.846
And the guys who, you know, are buying very expensive books from me have confidence in me and my pricing and why I'm pricing them that way.

36:16.045 --> 36:19.710
I think that's always going to be true, no matter what you're talking about.

36:19.771 --> 36:30.086
I mean, Graham Rader once said to me that, of course, this is Graham talking, so you have to take this with a grand grain of salt, but it's true in a way.

36:30.126 --> 36:35.754
He said, no sale over $100,000 is ever accomplished without great pain.

36:37.958 --> 36:41.563
And my experience of

36:42.235 --> 36:46.259
wealthy people is that they didn't get that way because they gave away money.

36:47.099 --> 36:55.887
And by and large, people who are spending very large amounts of money for things want to know why, and they want to know why in detail.

36:56.828 --> 37:05.616
And, you know, they expect you to be able to tell them quickly and not waste their time why they should spend a lot of money for it.

37:06.537 --> 37:12.242
We never finished, we started back at Yale, and we established how you

37:12.475 --> 37:16.842
You always had this passion for books and the people that you worked with.

37:16.862 --> 37:20.768
So you knew, you actually were a pro while you were an undergraduate.

37:20.788 --> 37:21.749
That's right, yeah.

37:21.769 --> 37:24.774
And so when you graduated in 77, I think you said it was?

37:24.914 --> 37:37.453
Yeah, actually, the first year I was out, I was working with the late Fred White, and I was still actually at that point a little unsure whether I wanted to pursue an academic career or a bookselling career.

37:37.954 --> 37:41.419
So the academic year after I graduated,

37:41.804 --> 37:44.707
I actually worked at the Beinecke.

37:45.227 --> 37:56.138
And as about, you know, I kind of worked there maybe 30 hours a week on an unpaid basis as Archie Hanna's assistant.

37:56.579 --> 38:00.823
And I spent the other rest of my time working book selling.

38:01.664 --> 38:04.466
And so... Based here in Little Haven.

38:04.486 --> 38:05.247
Yeah.

38:05.267 --> 38:11.153
And out of that experience, I mean, it was a very valuable experience to me.

38:11.808 --> 38:14.731
in terms of, you know, really working in a rare book library.

38:15.712 --> 38:25.464
I didn't think it was valuable to them, too, because one of the main things I did for them was survey sections of the stacks, finding things that should be in Beinecke that shouldn't be in Sterling.

38:26.605 --> 38:38.018
So I pulled a lot of, you know, you get any big old great general collection, like Harvard's or Yale's or, you know, any of the big old universities, and they just stopped sitting in open stacks that shouldn't be there.

38:38.774 --> 38:42.639
And I pulled some amazing stuff out of the stacks and moved it to Beinecke.

38:44.201 --> 38:53.632
Can you think off the top, without even having to be that specific, the kinds of things you might find in Stirling that instantly spoke up?

38:53.672 --> 39:05.507
The nicest one is a book that Clarence King did when he was running the King Survey in the West, and Timothy O'Sullivan, a famous photographer, was working with him.

39:05.943 --> 39:11.091
He did a gift book for Christmas called Three Lakes, and it's dedicated.

39:11.171 --> 39:12.252
He found these three lakes.

39:12.312 --> 39:13.033
Christmas what?

39:13.054 --> 39:13.114
18?

39:13.214 --> 39:14.075
Christmas 1870.

39:14.175 --> 39:19.002
They're three lakes high on the Sierras he named after his three nieces.

39:20.404 --> 39:22.467
And it's a big folio book.

39:22.788 --> 39:25.572
He made ten copies for presentation.

39:26.243 --> 39:28.486
with 10 mounted O'Sullivan photographs.

39:29.247 --> 39:31.490
The Yale copy he gave to O.C.

39:31.530 --> 39:35.495
Marsh, the great paleontologist, who was a Yale professor and a great friend of his.

39:35.575 --> 39:39.780
Marsh left his library to Yale when he died, went into the Yale library.

39:39.860 --> 39:43.545
The call number, just to give you an idea, the Yale call number was C3.

39:44.346 --> 39:44.566
Wow.

39:45.147 --> 39:50.454
And it was stuck, you know, sitting up in a folio thing on its side.

39:50.835 --> 39:51.415
In Sterling.

39:51.475 --> 39:52.537
In Sterling.

39:52.557 --> 39:55.120
I mean, there has never been one for sale

39:55.454 --> 39:58.078
since I pulled that out and moved it over in 1978.

39:58.278 --> 40:00.441
Well, there were only 10 presidents.

40:00.501 --> 40:01.462
There were only 10.

40:01.483 --> 40:02.163
There are others.

40:02.384 --> 40:03.906
There are no copies.

40:03.946 --> 40:07.972
Harvard has one, and I checked it at one point.

40:08.232 --> 40:09.534
AAS May?

40:10.115 --> 40:13.479
Four or five of them are locatable at this point.

40:13.540 --> 40:17.445
You know, I'd have to think if that came up, it would go for $60,000, $70,000.

40:18.505 --> 40:21.088
There it was sitting in a stag.

40:22.049 --> 40:24.211
And there are also some tragic things.

40:24.231 --> 40:27.374
There was a Folio McKennian Hall sitting up there, which is not a rare book.

40:27.394 --> 40:28.436
Yale's got a couple of copies.

40:28.456 --> 40:28.976
What points again?

40:29.477 --> 40:35.183
Folio McKennian Hall, a North American Indian, a purchase of North American Indians.

40:35.203 --> 40:43.231
At that point, in 1978, it was a $10,000 to $12,000 book, and every plate was missing.

40:43.552 --> 40:43.892
Jesus.

40:44.192 --> 40:46.875
You know, somebody had systematically removed the plates.

40:47.699 --> 40:50.383
You know, Yale had a couple other sets in Beinecke.

40:50.403 --> 40:55.551
It wasn't a blower to their research collections, but on the other hand, it was a duplicate.

40:55.831 --> 40:58.575
They could have traded it for something they needed.

40:59.396 --> 41:05.345
So, you know, there were some things that were missing, but there were also a lot of really quite extraordinary things.

41:05.425 --> 41:06.707
So you spent the year doing this?

41:07.509 --> 41:16.542
I spent, yeah, nine months, and I really, at the end of it, came out convinced that bookselling was for me.

41:17.365 --> 41:30.457
by nature impatient of bureaucratic constraints, and I have kind of, you know, I have an entrepreneurial view of the world, and less highly developed than it is now.

41:30.477 --> 41:31.778
So you have to have this business.

41:31.918 --> 41:35.481
There has to be a businessman in Bill Reese, too, doesn't there?

41:35.682 --> 41:36.562
Well, absolutely.

41:36.582 --> 41:40.686
I mean, this is, you know, this is an essential element.

41:40.706 --> 41:42.508
It's like knowing how to buy books.

41:43.268 --> 41:46.191
If you're not a good business person, you can't run a small business.

41:46.525 --> 41:52.852
And there are a lot of aspects of running a small business that are universal issues that have nothing to do with what you're doing.

41:54.614 --> 41:59.239
And so, yeah, you do have to successfully combine those.

41:59.279 --> 42:07.428
I mean, in American bookselling, I mean, the person who most successfully combined a passion for the material in an entrepreneurial sense was Krauss.

42:08.449 --> 42:12.393
I know Krauss built a great rare book business.

42:12.413 --> 42:13.815
He also made a fortune in

42:14.015 --> 42:15.096
the reprint business.

42:15.116 --> 42:17.238
He bought the Otto Bettman collection.

42:17.278 --> 42:22.564
Yeah, which his heirs, you know, were able to cash in for quite a nice sum to Bill Gates.

42:23.625 --> 42:27.649
You know, he was a great businessman, but he also had a passion for material.

42:28.390 --> 42:40.242
You know, Rosenbach, who's a greater scholar and was a great bookseller because of his enthusiasm, but he was a man who didn't have great business sense.

42:40.610 --> 42:42.652
Yeah, exactly.

42:42.672 --> 42:49.539
I mean, it's hard to say, as, you know, Eddie Wolfe comments several times, I mean, what really would have happened if it hadn't been Philip.

42:49.559 --> 42:52.982
And Philip, on one hand, was a burrer and an irritant.

42:53.543 --> 42:55.205
Hated him.

42:55.225 --> 43:02.572
But he was a very important part of the business, because he provided a lot of drive that Rosenbach might not have had on his own.

43:04.053 --> 43:07.697
Rosenbach would have gotten, you know, too off the track.

43:08.470 --> 43:19.001
And one thing we haven't really hit, and we've hit most of the things I want to do, which is good, the satisfaction that you must feel in helping build collections.

43:19.502 --> 43:26.549
There was one thing I found on LexisNexis, and it's a guy I never heard of, and it was a story out of Portland, Oregon.

43:26.569 --> 43:28.932
Oh, Roger Renlick, yeah.

43:29.332 --> 43:31.034
Yeah, and this was something that you had worked on.

43:31.054 --> 43:35.659
Right, Roger did this NPR show about Lewis and Clark.

43:36.955 --> 43:49.774
But, you know, that's an instance, I guess, where you've worked on a collection that... Well... You were just talking about the satisfaction period, and if you've seen it, you can have it if you'd like it.

43:51.356 --> 43:52.297
It's a piece that I found.

43:52.317 --> 43:58.787
I was searching for you when I came up with this... Yeah, no, I got a copy of this, as a matter of fact.

43:58.807 --> 44:00.309
Well, yeah, there is great satisfaction.

44:00.329 --> 44:05.697
I mean, I think that, again, and I think this is true of other...

44:06.858 --> 44:30.958
other people i view as my peers in the trade almost inevitably from my point of view some of my best customers have become really great friends of mine and so um you know i i've come to feel some kind of personal investment in what they're doing um because they're they're friends as well as customers

44:31.580 --> 44:35.366
And I think, you know, this is true time and time again in the book business.

44:35.386 --> 44:36.928
It's one of the nice things about the book business.

44:36.948 --> 44:46.323
I mean, there are always going to be people that you're dealing with somewhat at arm's length and who don't, where you don't develop that kind of tie.

44:46.884 --> 44:53.034
But, I mean, I think, again, if you look at the career of a Rosenbach, that's very much part of Rosenbach's career.

44:53.054 --> 44:55.798
I mean, the people who were his best customers were people who were

44:56.386 --> 44:57.328
Not uniformly.

44:57.368 --> 45:03.459
I mean, people like the Harknesses, they may have been the people who bought the most from him, and he was never really that close to him.

45:03.479 --> 45:06.284
But look at Frank Hogan first.

45:06.524 --> 45:07.225
Look at the letters.

45:07.285 --> 45:08.588
I mean, I looked at those letters.

45:08.968 --> 45:12.274
I called that chapter Brandy for Heroes, because he writes Hogan.

45:12.715 --> 45:14.518
He says, when you're in Philly, you must come by.

45:14.558 --> 45:18.585
We'll have cocktails, and I want to introduce you to my friends in Philadelphia.

45:18.626 --> 45:20.048
Remember what Johnson said?

45:20.298 --> 45:23.422
Brandy for Heroes.

45:25.004 --> 45:27.768
Hogan, or Rosenwald, or Elkins.

45:27.788 --> 45:29.450
You know, those people are Newtons.

45:29.470 --> 45:30.852
They were very friendly.

45:30.892 --> 45:34.457
Yeah, I mean, Shai's father, in my sense, was somewhat more standoffish kind of guy.

45:34.958 --> 45:40.906
But, you know, those people were people where he really did have their interests at heart in a variety of ways.

45:41.026 --> 45:46.373
And so I think it's one of the nicest things about the book business is that

45:47.213 --> 45:54.159
You know, somebody like, say, Mike Zinman, you know, has been a very good friend of mine as well as somebody who I've dealt with for, you know, for many, many years.

45:55.080 --> 45:57.642
And so I think there's a lot of satisfaction there.

45:57.662 --> 46:07.011
But even if it's a person that doesn't become that close of a friend, there must be a feeling of satisfaction, knowing that you've helped shape what must be a very significant collection.

46:07.031 --> 46:08.292
Yeah, there is.

46:08.652 --> 46:09.032
There is.

46:09.293 --> 46:16.579
I mean... You know, people come to you, and you go through these consultations, and you bring your

46:17.099 --> 46:30.054
knowledge and your research to it, and then you see this body of material developing and growing, and, you know, I'm sure that there are many research level collections that have developed out of what you do.

46:30.074 --> 46:36.321
Well, yeah, as I said, I mean, I think some people you end up developing close relationships with, and I think I feel it more there.

46:36.361 --> 46:44.770
I mean, you know, I have good customers who I'm perfectly friendly with, but, you know, we just never develop that close relationship.

46:44.790 --> 46:46.532
You know, they order from catalogs.

46:46.833 --> 46:49.616
I just feel they don't want to.

46:50.216 --> 46:51.658
They're not interested in that.

46:51.878 --> 46:54.721
They want to buy the books, and that's all they want.

46:54.781 --> 46:58.945
And other people you just get a lot more involved with.

46:58.965 --> 47:01.188
No, this is not for this piece, but it is interesting.

47:01.208 --> 47:05.792
You know, John Block, you went to Yale with him.

47:05.812 --> 47:06.273
Right, yeah.

47:06.393 --> 47:07.234
And he's so funny.

47:07.254 --> 47:09.736
In fact, he's now in the growing room.

47:09.756 --> 47:11.879
We went out for cocktails at the Yale Club.

47:12.139 --> 47:16.283
Well, the second time around.

47:16.718 --> 47:21.683
Yeah, well, John, as you know, I mean, John is the last of a truly diamond breed.

47:21.884 --> 47:25.848
John is actually an old-fashioned press lord, and there aren't many old-fashioned press lords left, you know.

47:25.868 --> 47:27.950
No, you can really count them like this.

47:28.050 --> 47:31.174
And he still behaves like an old-fashioned press lord in lots of ways.

47:31.314 --> 47:34.478
Three-piece, I think he wore a three-piece suit to... As he did every day at Yale.

47:34.498 --> 47:38.962
Believe me, he was the only person walking around Yale in 1975 with a three-piece suit on.

47:41.245 --> 47:42.927
Well, what was your collection?

47:42.987 --> 47:44.008
I would like to know about

47:44.765 --> 47:47.108
What was the collection award, the Van Sinderen Award?

47:47.128 --> 47:48.389
Well, actually, I had two different collections.

47:48.409 --> 47:49.210
And you won it twice?

47:49.470 --> 47:52.934
I won it because the Van Sinderen Award is a sophomore prize and a senior prize.

47:52.954 --> 47:53.675
So you won it both?

47:53.795 --> 48:04.587
My sophomore prize, my big collection at that point, which is I've now dispersed, for the most part, was my collection on ranching and cattle trade in the West.

48:05.388 --> 48:10.193
And my second, because my senior year, I didn't enter that at all.

48:10.373 --> 48:13.557
I entered, maybe this would answer John's complaint,

48:14.060 --> 48:18.546
I entered my reference collection, because by that point I was a bookseller.

48:18.566 --> 48:26.676
And actually, I didn't collect anything except reference books for a long period of time after I entered the book business.

48:26.937 --> 48:30.221
Reference books have always been considered legitimate things for booksellers to collect.

48:30.241 --> 48:34.206
Well, that's basically what I collect now is material that supports my research.

48:34.226 --> 48:34.326
Yeah.

48:34.346 --> 48:40.454
So that's what I entered the second time as my reference collection, so.

48:40.474 --> 48:43.358
You're so funny.

48:43.574 --> 48:43.995
L.D.

48:44.075 --> 48:46.338
Brodsky, he didn't win.

48:46.358 --> 48:52.027
It pisses him off to this day that he finished second, you know, when he was at Yale, his Faulkner collection.

48:52.308 --> 48:58.498
There was some guy who had a collection on railroad timetables, you know.

48:58.518 --> 48:59.139
Railroad timetables?

48:59.159 --> 49:00.160
I don't know about that.

49:00.180 --> 49:04.587
I mean, I've been... Well, I mentioned it to the fellow, I forget his name right now, who ran the Elizabethan club.

49:04.607 --> 49:05.008
Chief Parks.

49:05.191 --> 49:07.234
And he said, yes, I know that collection.

49:07.314 --> 49:09.958
I said, I know that railroad timetable.

49:09.978 --> 49:11.500
That was a very good collection.

49:11.520 --> 49:13.083
Well, maybe I get through that.

49:13.103 --> 49:19.112
I've been a judge of the prize since a couple of years after I graduated, and we've seen it all, believe me.

49:19.132 --> 49:19.432
I know.

49:19.472 --> 49:24.259
We have one at Clark now that I judge with a few other people.

49:24.940 --> 49:29.427
But, you know, the Van Sinner Prize, the criteria has always been

49:30.908 --> 49:38.338
putting together a context, putting together a collection that meant something as a collection, not the value of the book.

49:39.720 --> 49:43.084
So that's always been the criteria, is the imagination.

49:43.104 --> 49:52.677
And that is the criteria, and I think especially with undergraduates, you know, anybody, well, if they've got the resources, go out and put together and design a collection.

49:52.737 --> 49:53.058
Yeah.

49:54.019 --> 50:00.848
And so we've never, you know, we've always been a little charry of author collections.

50:01.317 --> 50:13.251
Because, you know, and frankly, you know, not for his years, but, you know, something like Faulkner is like, how boring can you get?

50:13.271 --> 50:27.848
It's like, one publisher, you know, the guy, except for the early stuff, which he, you know, just expensive stuff he wasn't into yet, you know, you got one publisher, they all look the same, they're all the same formats, the limiteds are all these kind of modern, pre-unit limiteds as opposed to,

50:28.773 --> 50:33.678
And Faulkner really wasn't that collectible, I think, when he was doing it, so they were, you could get them.

50:33.858 --> 50:34.418
Yeah.

50:34.458 --> 50:43.026
Well, he was, he was, but I mean, it wasn't like, you know, terrific imagination was needed to collect Faulkner.

50:43.046 --> 50:45.068
I mean, he was, he was really into Faulkner.

50:45.088 --> 50:45.649
He read all of Faulkner.

50:45.669 --> 50:48.631
Well, so am I. I mean, you know, so what?

50:50.253 --> 50:51.814
And in that sense, the others were.

50:52.695 --> 50:54.136
One other thing we should cover.

50:54.217 --> 50:58.020
I'm giving a talk in July,

50:58.540 --> 51:01.423
The ALA is invited me, and they've got this theme.

51:01.443 --> 51:06.229
In fact, this was Eric Holzenberg at the Grocer Publishing, to be honest.

51:06.409 --> 51:11.355
And the theme is the museum of the book.

51:11.375 --> 51:24.970
Do you foresee a time where to discuss whether or not we think that we are approaching a time when libraries will essentially be museums, and all the physical artifacts therein be, you know, specimens.

51:25.388 --> 51:34.197
I mean, do you think that with computer technology and the future of books, do you think we're approaching a time where all books are going to be rare and curious objects?

51:34.778 --> 51:35.779
Completely the opposite.

51:35.919 --> 51:47.611
I think that the fastest growing field of study that I've seen in modern academia is the history of the book, the history of readership.

51:47.651 --> 51:48.752
Exactly.

51:49.053 --> 51:53.117
It's a field that's concentrated very much on the artifact
