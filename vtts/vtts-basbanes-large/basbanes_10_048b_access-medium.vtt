WEBVTT

00:02.748 --> 00:08.335
Do we have some?

00:08.636 --> 00:14.543
Do we have some?

00:14.703 --> 00:16.806
Have you got to the window of any piece?

00:16.826 --> 00:17.987
They have it yet.

00:18.208 --> 00:32.586
Now we're going to just close in the planet and we just arrived personally presently a few minutes ago as a new piece just published called Califia and we're going to get a glimmering of it

00:33.022 --> 00:38.934
in anticipation of this event has written us a greeting.

00:39.916 --> 00:41.840
Does it go?

00:41.860 --> 00:51.300
Is it singing yet?

00:52.681 --> 01:03.027
Thank you.

01:03.048 --> 01:03.248
Thank you.

01:09.843 --> 01:26.586
Come on.

01:26.566 --> 01:44.254
Oh, my God.

01:44.234 --> 02:07.423
This is a very simple and quick thing because

02:07.758 --> 02:17.294
Robert Cooper was kind enough to put me on the program even though I wasn't sure I could get here on time and make the presentation.

02:17.334 --> 02:19.358
So this was and had two goals in mind.

02:19.378 --> 02:24.387
The first one was to give me a virtual presentation that someone could run if I wasn't here.

02:24.727 --> 02:32.280
And my actual second goal was to have one whole little teeny tiny piece that I didn't have to say, well, you know,

02:32.362 --> 02:42.755
the fonts aren't coming up right here, and I can't get the sound right on this, you know, but forget that, because that goal has already gone away, and I think it doesn't exist in our universe.

02:42.775 --> 02:55.450
But this is actually, I've found that it's easier when I'm using music not to try to talk at the same time as the invitation, and also

02:55.801 --> 03:15.593
It seemed to me when I started thinking about a gathering such as this that it was a time to celebrate a little bit as well, that we could just celebrate the fact that hypertext was progressing, that lots of things were happening, that wonderful things were going on, and we could kind of bask in that, fill a while.

03:15.814 --> 03:16.695
That's what this is.

03:26.058 --> 03:50.547
There you are!

03:51.067 --> 04:00.737
Let me scroll this in you.

04:00.757 --> 04:01.279
Give it a long tight face.

04:07.520 --> 04:25.448
.

04:25.468 --> 04:25.488
.

04:25.508 --> 04:25.528
.

04:25.508 --> 04:52.360
... ... ...

04:56.137 --> 05:15.208
Oh.

05:19.424 --> 05:20.847
But this is not a hypertext.

05:20.867 --> 05:23.913
As Mark pointed out in his last piece, there's a difference.

05:24.213 --> 05:29.123
And so you will see that any presentation is always linear.

05:29.564 --> 05:33.251
And the hypertextment of it seems to get lost.

05:33.572 --> 05:38.682
So I decided I would try to make it easy on whoever would read this, and it just goes straight on.

05:53.478 --> 06:10.586
Can we look back?

06:10.606 --> 06:10.947
Can we look back?

06:21.035 --> 06:47.331
This is frames, and I have a north-south-east-west that sits on here, and you'll have to look at it at the website where it does apparently show, and I can't show you the frames because I can't get to my length, a thing one should always think about.

06:47.412 --> 06:48.493
Let this be a lesson.

06:48.895 --> 06:57.524
The journey south is just a few blocks down Fairfax Avenue in Hollywood, but we can't get to the journey east, north, and west.

06:58.307 --> 07:00.053
Still, they won't go anywhere.

07:15.878 --> 07:17.981
which you don't even have to read.

07:18.041 --> 07:25.654
Califia is just too big to handle, to send people and have them download, you know, 500 megabytes under their computer.

07:25.674 --> 07:27.056
They just get touchy about that.

07:28.378 --> 07:38.494
So I thought I'd show a little bit from Figures on Digital, Fingerprints on Digital Glass, which is my newest web piece.

07:53.527 --> 08:09.692
And the story I'm going to show you is Fibonacci's Daughter.

08:09.712 --> 08:22.251
Fibonacci members, if anyone knows about them, and Fibonacci concepts as both the narrative structure and as part of the

08:23.530 --> 08:25.392
story structure as well.

08:39.511 --> 08:46.980
However, I had to do it on Toolbook because I couldn't possibly design anything like this on the web.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.682
It's just too hard to manipulate.

08:49.924 --> 08:51.546
I mean, like working on a browser.

08:52.420 --> 08:58.915
Annagel Compson is the main character.

08:58.935 --> 09:02.222
She tells her story among other people who tell her stories.

09:06.813 --> 09:09.178
She as truly is the provider of the story.

09:09.198 --> 09:11.644
She's a local reporter.

09:16.805 --> 09:25.524
I saw her work being shown down in South Carolina after Halloween like a long ago.

09:25.585 --> 09:28.030
She'd been here around before.

09:28.837 --> 09:42.085
What most struck me about Stephanie, besides the beauty of her work, was the lucidity of her explanations and her sense of what she's doing, what she's working with.

09:42.105 --> 09:47.537
She's a key person here at this event and will be on the panel tomorrow morning.

09:48.884 --> 09:58.883
She is the only one who works necessarily well marketing it, too, because we do a website version off a PC instead of a Mac.

09:58.963 --> 10:00.666
You know, all the predictions are right.

10:00.706 --> 10:05.575
She's the only one who's worked with a viewable .

10:05.595 --> 10:06.437
Thank you.

10:07.345 --> 10:21.160
But artists or drums, too, they don't necessarily do all these smart things.

10:21.180 --> 10:25.345
OK, hello, hello.

10:25.365 --> 10:36.998
I never realized that when I worked on a platform that 90% of the people in the country are on, it would be such a difficult thing in terms of presentations, but it seems to me.

10:38.429 --> 10:47.982
Part of my presentation is also done with toolbook, for which I'd like to thank Margie for her help in doing this presentation.

10:52.928 --> 10:56.272
True North is written with story space for windows.

10:56.913 --> 11:03.542
The Eastgate cover features the Northern Lights paired here with an overview map of the top level hypertext structure.

11:05.547 --> 11:15.820
True North is about direction finding in what I call a mother lost world.

11:16.541 --> 11:23.269
Here you see maps of two of the five major sub-levels of True North, the mother lost world and there was an old woman.

11:24.210 --> 11:33.782
In exploring how bodily functions get translated into different kinds of language used for mapping or guidance, True North focuses on the idea of pregnancy

11:34.049 --> 11:35.852
one height contained inside another.

11:36.453 --> 11:44.407
The containment part of this idea is close to what is called embedding, or self-similarity, or substitute in other contexts.

11:44.427 --> 11:47.873
And that is part of what made these poems particularly suited to hypertext.

11:48.814 --> 11:54.564
For True North was originally a book whose cover featured an image by Joseph Cornell called Constellation.

11:55.346 --> 11:59.112
Both covers suggest a kind of writing on uncharted space.

12:00.222 --> 12:08.051
Here you see one of the pages from True North taken from the print reference book, The Annotated Mother Goose, which I've scribbled all over.

12:08.491 --> 12:10.694
That is, annotated.

12:10.714 --> 12:20.065
The act of annotating, connecting differently, making new paths, rewriting charted space, is basic both to poetry and to hypertext.

12:21.927 --> 12:24.990
Here are maps of the history and math sections of True North.

12:25.691 --> 12:29.976
All of the maps I've shown so far I specifically shaped to aid recall,

12:30.243 --> 12:35.530
to encode characteristics of their specific sections and to constrain overall link structure.

12:36.391 --> 12:38.574
The fifth section is Blue Planet Blues.

12:39.275 --> 12:44.341
True Norse takes place on a believer in Blue Planet whose people put their faith in science.

12:44.361 --> 12:46.904
They have largely forgotten the old woman.

12:47.685 --> 12:53.533
I was asked to describe a picture of the software that I wanted that the software couldn't do.

12:54.134 --> 12:55.896
These Loomy link maps.

12:55.977 --> 13:04.986
malleable and graphically suggestive are so great an improvement on the grid style maps that it prompted me to want maps that rotate in three dimensions.

13:05.766 --> 13:16.657
To me, the inter-orientation of the poems is as much a memory molecule as any protein and I want maps that fold like hemoglobin or DNA with a URB marker.

13:17.838 --> 13:21.782
Reading story space involves one in acting out

13:23.804 --> 13:30.033
both the orientation navigation themes and the embeddedness themes.

13:30.053 --> 13:36.102
And I'd like to show you how that works in practice by taking me through a loop of poems in story space.

13:36.623 --> 13:47.598
For those of you not familiar with story space, but I realize that there are very few people in this room, if I choose locate writing space, I get a list of all of the nodes or lexia in the hypertext.

13:48.239 --> 13:53.507
Each of these spaces has a name in this work, and the text embedded in them has its own

13:53.757 --> 13:59.443
The simplest way to read True North is by hitting the enter key.

14:00.063 --> 14:01.985
You'll notice that some of the words are colored.

14:02.286 --> 14:03.747
These are not clickable links.

14:04.288 --> 14:08.792
Each color operates visually to suggest a connection between similarly colored words.

14:09.273 --> 14:13.837
Each color is thus a link tracked not by software, but by human memory.

14:14.878 --> 14:17.921
To reveal clickable links, I hold down the control key.

14:17.941 --> 14:20.524
Boxes appear around linked words or phrases.

14:21.162 --> 14:25.126
If I click in the box, I'm usually taken to a different section of the hypertext.

14:25.807 --> 14:38.439
But with this link, a woman's form, I get a choice of places to go, this time a choice of two, Emily Dickinson or Weather, but sometimes many more.

14:41.022 --> 14:43.644
One might also travel by using math.

14:47.728 --> 14:49.330
Let me make this a little bit larger.

14:53.022 --> 14:57.227
This is a map you've seen before, the mother lost world, the one that I shaped.

14:57.727 --> 14:59.970
I like to look at it as a so-called tree map.

15:03.333 --> 15:04.855
Again, making it a little bit larger.

15:06.417 --> 15:08.780
We're at the embedded Lexia alphabet.

15:09.200 --> 15:15.367
If I go up two levels, I can see all the Lexia in true north.

15:15.747 --> 15:20.953
And here you'll see that the mother lost world has been straightened into a column with all that may suggest.

15:21.727 --> 15:27.153
I'm going to start with Alexei and Vectors, which contains the poem Striving All My Life.

15:28.074 --> 15:38.206
In this poem, James Clark Maxwell, father of the electronic age, discovers with delight the vector spaces and notation invented by Willard Gibbs, America's first mathematical physicist.

15:38.947 --> 15:45.635
Gibbs and his contemporary, Emily Dickinson, are passionate inventors of new graphics-based ways to communicate.

15:46.395 --> 15:47.717
As Maxwell said,

15:48.001 --> 15:54.250
I have been striving all my life to be free of the yoke of Cartesian coordinates.

15:54.270 --> 15:58.817
I found such an instrument in, well finally he found it in gifts.

15:59.758 --> 16:03.404
And if we leave this poem by choosing a link to introduce knowledge.

16:09.112 --> 16:11.055
We are taken to the Lexia dream.

16:11.778 --> 16:19.708
Here we find a personal view of science and its history by the chemist who prepared the fishnable material for the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs.

16:19.728 --> 16:20.889
I'll read a small section.

16:22.071 --> 16:24.874
I still have vivid sensual memories of that time.

16:25.715 --> 16:31.663
Men seizing red-hot snakes of copper, threading them curving back and forth through the wire rod mill at Ansonia.

16:31.703 --> 16:39.152
To this day, a frequent dream is of wandering through complex assemblies of industrial buildings full of such machines.

16:39.419 --> 16:44.644
in search of something I never find, and if we choose searching something.

16:47.647 --> 16:50.950
It takes us to one of the appearances of the old woman.

16:52.091 --> 16:56.595
This poem, Who, is both an invocation and evocation of her.

16:59.818 --> 17:03.761
Who, then, sweeps them loose?

17:03.941 --> 17:08.886
Who defuses broken, shining bits the far-flung force

17:09.203 --> 17:38.181
washed foam on a rock face, succulents and whelks alive inside its raising spray, who slings the broth aside in cups of ocean swell, whose bolt of lace, a great spill of it, blowing in the window with her pins, patterns the firmament, patterns the phosphorescent body of an eel making slip knots in the dark sea, patterns fireflies,

17:38.397 --> 17:54.959
sailing through grass at the edge of a world, lit and unlit at twilight, giving body to the air, or to some brimming being, who's, who, choosing body to the air.

17:58.604 --> 18:00.827
Brings us to the Lexian embryos,

18:01.499 --> 18:11.270
Technological embryos do occur in True North, but this poem is in the voice of a young woman trying to make sense of her pregnant body, a body transformed by embedding.

18:11.851 --> 18:14.033
She's trying to use the language of science.

18:16.796 --> 18:22.423
I wish I knew them better, those infant explorers.

18:23.424 --> 18:31.253
I wish I knew more of them, single cells in the primitive streak, how they know when, each one free moving,

18:31.604 --> 18:43.494
to go away, how they know one by one to slip their mooring to become a sex cord, a neural arch, the heart.

18:43.514 --> 18:55.104
I wish I could see the heart's rudiment form, see mantle edges thicken into a tube, the heart a hole, a closed pocket inside.

18:55.965 --> 19:01.510
I feel, breaking away by choosing a closed pocket,

19:05.422 --> 19:11.414
brings us to the reflexion desire, the poem, American Artificers.

19:13.839 --> 19:26.704
Gives making found what lies hidden so deeply nested is it within so down deeply pocketed miles from the icy calm notational surface.

19:27.258 --> 19:39.531
making a line, a lure, one symbol, one elliptical expression, holding echo upon echo, decoding to a capable and infinite acceptance.

19:41.052 --> 19:54.126
Detonation as almost welcome and always implicit in the mind, like the cloud low and going to snow in Connecticut, great still pool.

19:54.764 --> 20:01.916
demoralized desire that waits for snow, as if the snow were winged.

20:03.178 --> 20:07.906
So there's one kind of loop that we can take, and I'd like to end by mentioning one other.

20:07.946 --> 20:20.046
Which is created by the running graphic in the Numbers section of True North,

20:20.583 --> 20:42.996
running from zero to an empty set of parens to ever deeper nesting of the parentheses suggesting the embedding of these number types and the number line the most inclusive imaginary through the reals the rationals the integers the natural numbers let me just make this a little larger and that

20:43.702 --> 20:52.512
This representation leads us to the acronym, I'm Rirena, indeed in name, I'm Rirena, I'm Rewriting.

20:53.293 --> 20:56.757
And if we were to choose from there, the link, Scar of the Skin.

20:56.777 --> 21:08.011
It would take us to the Lexia Fractality, the poem, Presto, How the Universe is Made, which is a new sort of number, a new sort of claim.

21:09.012 --> 21:13.337
And I'd like to conclude by asking whether the rewriting these numbers compel.

21:13.975 --> 21:17.020
does drive us toward true three-dimensional computer modeling.

21:17.801 --> 21:23.972
After all, a picture is worth a thousand words, then a sculpture is worth 31 million in some.

21:23.992 --> 21:27.537
Whereas this poem has 170 words, including the title.

21:28.539 --> 21:32.886
I think we need to ask just when it is that we might prefer 170 words.

21:33.047 --> 21:33.908
Thank you very much.

21:44.958 --> 22:04.589
I hope before, we were talking about online magazines before, and I hope to be able, before introducing Edward Falco, to take a look at the latest issue of his online magazine, New River, which has some very beautiful work in it, and I urge you to take a look at it.

22:04.729 --> 22:09.717
All these websites are available over the next couple of days from that sort of STG.

22:10.338 --> 22:16.226
It's unfortunately, partly on Shockwave, that we haven't been able to shuffle it up on this machine.

22:17.448 --> 22:27.281
But we did see the Iowa Review, we saw Evergreen Review, and I guess what we're going to look at now.

22:27.301 --> 22:37.695
Here at Brown, we have our own online lit mag, Impossible Object, by the gifted novelist and storyteller, Ben Marcus.

22:38.637 --> 22:44.314
Then, together with Matt Derby, I might mention, have also been responsible for our folks' memorial website that you saw before.

22:45.597 --> 22:50.672
And we might be able to see a couple of the current hypertexts

23:03.764 --> 23:04.847
No PC.

23:06.510 --> 23:09.277
No computer.

23:09.297 --> 23:14.790
All right, well, leave it alone.

23:16.354 --> 23:17.757
And let's bring

23:19.255 --> 23:26.328
Edward Faulkner is one of the more experimental and wide-ranging of our new electronic fiction writers.

23:27.310 --> 23:30.295
He's doing several works now in addition to editing this magazine.

23:30.335 --> 23:40.554
He's probably as aware of any fiction writer who could have possible acceptance to himself about all of the varieties that are now possible and happening out there.

23:41.095 --> 23:42.057
Edward Faulkner, please.

23:50.238 --> 23:57.910
I've noticed that poets, when they're worried about pushing the concentration of their audience, often tell them there are only two poems left in the original book.

23:57.930 --> 23:58.651
There's only two readers left.

23:59.092 --> 24:00.534
And the last one was Stuart Malker.

24:00.554 --> 24:04.020
So I urge you to hang in.

24:04.681 --> 24:10.230
I've been concentrating recently on storytelling about hypertext environments.

24:11.031 --> 24:13.054
And that's what this piece is.

24:13.135 --> 24:15.438
It's one of several pieces that I tell them.

24:15.458 --> 24:16.600
They try to tell a story.

24:17.525 --> 24:18.646
It's hypertextual.

24:18.666 --> 24:21.790
You can enter the piece through any of these subtitles.

24:21.830 --> 24:24.193
Her story, his story, the other guys.

24:24.374 --> 24:26.196
The title of the piece is Charmin Cleary.

24:26.216 --> 24:26.937
It's in progress.

24:27.037 --> 24:30.381
It was what I was working on when I was asked to come.

24:30.922 --> 24:34.186
So I'm just going to do a reading from it.

24:34.206 --> 24:34.987
Charmin Cleary.

24:38.171 --> 24:38.692
Her story.

24:41.035 --> 24:45.661
She hardly looks like a powerhouse point guard everybody in West Virginia knows by sight.

24:45.781 --> 24:46.362
She's cute.

24:46.442 --> 24:47.363
She's 5'7".

24:47.596 --> 24:52.762
She wears her hair short, topped off at the years, with the ends slightly ragged, stylish and ragged.

24:53.943 --> 24:58.088
In the last two years, she's led the team from Sweet 16 and Elite Eight.

24:58.108 --> 25:00.730
This is her senior year, and who knows, with her talent?

25:01.651 --> 25:05.215
Which is why everyone is taking this so seriously.

25:05.235 --> 25:10.521
In the inner office of Dean Bryant's suite, she sits like Abe Lincoln in a cushioned leather chair.

25:11.202 --> 25:15.367
She looks out the window at blue skies and fat green mountains in the near distance.

25:16.528 --> 25:17.569
Dean is an old and

25:17.870 --> 25:28.900
In her early 60s, her sad eyes, sunken at the center of a brownish, withered hollow of skin over skull, are fixed on Charmaine, whom the newspapers call the charm or charming.

25:29.981 --> 25:31.343
The outer office is bustling.

25:32.003 --> 25:35.687
The murmur of several conversations seep through the walls.

25:38.089 --> 25:39.871
The first cop is like, you think what?

25:40.091 --> 25:42.033
And I'm like, well, I guess I slugged him.

25:42.773 --> 25:44.535
And he's, you guess you slugged him?

25:45.173 --> 25:47.536
Meanwhile, Blatt's totally out cold on the tiles.

25:48.117 --> 25:50.481
I had to step over him to get to the phone.

25:50.501 --> 25:55.688
He's six foot something, must weigh 275, 280, 50 of it in his butt alone.

25:56.750 --> 25:58.673
Two lines of blood spilling out his nose.

25:58.713 --> 26:01.697
He's starting to look like the opening shot on warm water.

26:02.118 --> 26:05.723
NYPD blue body on the street shop with a puddle of blood around his head.

26:06.224 --> 26:07.466
You know what Blatt looks like?

26:07.486 --> 26:10.089
He looks like Tony Soprano.

26:10.190 --> 26:11.912
Whacked out on lithium and crozac.

26:12.493 --> 26:13.454
You know what I'm talking about?

26:13.915 --> 26:14.556
Okay, never mind.

26:15.363 --> 26:16.785
He's living like shit on the floor.

26:17.486 --> 26:20.952
I'm trying to explain to the cop, who finally goes, just let me talk to him.

26:20.972 --> 26:22.995
So I tell him, well, you can't really do that.

26:23.256 --> 26:24.337
He's, why not?

26:24.357 --> 26:25.960
I'm, well, he's sort of unconscious.

26:26.841 --> 26:27.022
Quiet.

26:27.643 --> 26:28.404
OK, he says.

26:28.604 --> 26:29.345
He sounds pissed.

26:29.906 --> 26:30.207
Where are you?

26:30.648 --> 26:32.771
I tell him, Wixham Paul, 218.

26:33.132 --> 26:33.733
What's your name?

26:34.293 --> 26:35.335
Charmaine Cleary.

26:35.696 --> 26:35.876
Quiet.

26:36.517 --> 26:37.779
Charmaine Cleary, this is?

26:38.059 --> 26:38.961
Is this a joke?

26:38.981 --> 26:39.842
You think this is funny?

26:40.443 --> 26:41.505
Uh-uh, I go, it's me.

26:41.975 --> 26:49.121
You're telling me you're Charmaine Cleary and you slug one of your professors and he's unconscious, out cold, blow what it gets.

26:49.902 --> 26:51.123
Now his voice is a little different.

26:51.484 --> 26:53.505
Now he sounds like a computer.

26:53.525 --> 26:53.606
Ms.

26:53.666 --> 26:55.687
Cleary goes, please wait where you are.

26:56.228 --> 26:57.329
Someone would be right there.

27:00.632 --> 27:03.174
Professor Black, he's like, that's his real name, no shit.

27:03.254 --> 27:05.697
Black, he's like that too, Black.

27:06.397 --> 27:09.200
Everyone is, oh, Mr. Princeton in Harvard must be smart.

27:09.220 --> 27:11.762
Turns out the guy's like, I mean, this guy is dumb.

27:12.080 --> 27:15.486
She'd have to have a special license just to walk around in public.

27:15.546 --> 27:17.990
The first time I met him, I walked out of his office.

27:18.010 --> 27:22.978
I'm thinking, seriously, I'm going, I wonder if he's had some kind of brain injury recently.

27:23.018 --> 27:27.125
The guy takes a few seconds to point a thought, another couple of seconds to spit it out.

27:27.225 --> 27:30.831
Someone said it's because he's from the South.

27:30.851 --> 27:31.132
Fuck that.

27:31.172 --> 27:35.379
I know people from the South.

27:35.399 --> 27:37.142
The lights out the North would have let them succeed.

27:37.122 --> 27:41.466
Lincoln would have been like, yeah, get the fuck out of here.

27:41.486 --> 27:48.732
And listen, I'm not a prune, I'm not a big-time feminist, but this guy, I mean, right in the classroom, he's so slow, he doesn't seem to get.

27:48.752 --> 27:50.313
His face is like bulls anymore.

27:50.333 --> 27:52.895
Whatever he's thinking is like posted in clashing letters.

27:53.376 --> 27:56.318
Okay, he's never said anything, I admit that, and he's never done anything.

27:56.778 --> 27:58.760
He's never so much just put his hand on my arm.

27:59.120 --> 28:02.303
But I swear, every time this guy looks at me, you know he's only thinking one thing.

28:02.744 --> 28:06.927
His eyes get hungry, his mouth drops open, he means to me like a begging puppet.

28:07.092 --> 28:07.753
It's demeaning.

28:08.013 --> 28:08.574
It's humiliating.

28:08.594 --> 28:10.756
I would have dropped a class long ago.

28:11.236 --> 28:18.684
Except, no matter what shit I turn into, he comes back with a name.

28:18.704 --> 28:19.545
I clobbered him.

28:19.645 --> 28:19.826
Okay.

28:20.166 --> 28:21.888
Just because of the way he looked at me.

28:21.908 --> 28:22.168
I admit it.

28:22.629 --> 28:23.850
He didn't do anything.

28:23.870 --> 28:25.011
Guilty as charged.

28:25.031 --> 28:25.452
It's me.

28:25.652 --> 28:30.017
I fell in love and clobbered him for no reason except I didn't like the way he looked at me.

28:30.297 --> 28:30.517
There.

28:30.537 --> 28:31.398
Do I get run out of school now?

28:32.159 --> 28:34.441
Honey, he's in the hospital with a broken nose.

28:35.222 --> 28:36.103
I had no idea.

28:36.438 --> 28:37.499
and a mild concussion.

28:37.919 --> 28:40.982
Did I hit him that hard?

28:41.062 --> 28:42.643
You're an athlete.

28:42.663 --> 28:44.685
You bench pressed 250 pounds.

28:44.745 --> 28:47.688
You slapped him across the head.

28:48.489 --> 28:56.355
I grabbed him up at the desk.

28:56.375 --> 28:59.959
I didn't even know what I was doing.

29:00.099 --> 29:03.382
It was just a book.

29:03.402 --> 29:04.062
Funny.

29:04.082 --> 29:05.063
We went to Riverside Chase.

29:05.083 --> 29:05.343
A concussion.

29:05.363 --> 29:05.964
Real.

29:06.024 --> 29:06.124
Jeez.

29:07.522 --> 29:08.663
I'll just jump it down.

29:08.704 --> 29:10.205
You can read this anyway.

29:10.225 --> 29:15.692
A young woman and an older man, co-workers at the plant, walk away from a coffee machine, styrofoam cups in hand.

29:16.133 --> 29:17.755
They're on break for ten minutes.

29:17.775 --> 29:19.317
The woman's face is slightly red.

29:19.738 --> 29:22.201
The guy looks sleepy.

29:22.221 --> 29:23.763
Look, I say he gets thrown in jail.

29:23.803 --> 29:24.544
What kind of shit is that?

29:24.564 --> 29:26.927
He locked her in his office and split his desk in front of George?

29:27.407 --> 29:28.188
Where did you hear that?

29:28.369 --> 29:29.310
I know people at the school.

29:29.470 --> 29:30.311
That's not what I heard.

29:30.331 --> 29:32.494
I heard she wore short dresses to his class.

29:32.514 --> 29:32.774
So?

29:32.794 --> 29:33.455
What does that mean?

29:33.655 --> 29:34.717
Short dresses are in style.

29:35.117 --> 29:36.499
Yeah, but these were like belts.

29:36.918 --> 29:42.443
You guys, we're all the same.

29:42.463 --> 29:44.525
His story.

29:44.545 --> 29:51.110
He seems to be at peace, stretched out on the crisp white sheets of a hospital bed, an oxygen mask strapped over his face.

29:51.130 --> 29:57.336
He's a tall man, six foot plus, bulky and out of shape.

29:57.676 --> 30:03.641
His spitting hair has the shoe polish flat color of a bad guy, the kind he applies once a minute while he showers.

30:04.121 --> 30:05.963
Several shades too dark for his age.

30:06.500 --> 30:09.984
His dark hair emphasizes the waxy luster of his skin.

30:10.885 --> 30:15.169
If he could open his eyes, he'd see two nurses at their station on the other side of a large window.

30:15.570 --> 30:21.356
He'd see machines mounted on walls around his bed, and more machines positioned beside him on parts.

30:21.376 --> 30:25.580
He's alone in the room, which is hairless and smells of disinfectant.

30:25.981 --> 30:30.245
This machine that supplies his oxygen hises, a machine that monitors his heart beats.

30:30.265 --> 30:32.828
Another machine has a pain that's worrisome and glad.

30:33.837 --> 30:38.663
Beyond that window, in a lounge at the end of a long harbor, his wife has brought him to reporters.

30:39.124 --> 30:42.568
A cameraman is taking a while, a young woman points a microphone at her.

30:43.068 --> 30:45.071
A second reporter is taking notes.

30:45.091 --> 30:46.733
I don't understand, Mrs. Blatt says.

30:46.873 --> 30:48.315
He's the nicest guy in the world.

30:48.775 --> 30:50.297
He's never given me any trouble at all.

30:50.478 --> 30:51.379
My God, she says.

30:51.419 --> 30:52.400
He's a full professor.

30:52.840 --> 30:54.643
He's not a son.

30:54.923 --> 30:55.744
A son.

30:58.019 --> 31:07.008
Years since anyone looked at me with such subtle signaling of passion and promise as if pleading with me to pry open the locked chambers of a secret cell.

31:07.068 --> 31:07.449
Years.

31:08.330 --> 31:09.491
At first, I was surprised.

31:09.811 --> 31:10.312
Look at me.

31:10.332 --> 31:11.413
I'm an older man.

31:11.433 --> 31:16.538
Admittedly, women have always been drawn to what my wife describes as the animal adult of my physical body.

31:17.179 --> 31:18.180
I am a big man.

31:18.200 --> 31:21.503
There are women whose size doesn't even matter.

31:21.523 --> 31:22.724
Still, I was surprised.

31:23.125 --> 31:25.967
At first, I told myself that she was simply an attentive student.

31:26.028 --> 31:27.469
Her eyes sort out my eyes.

31:27.719 --> 31:35.830
She leaned forward as if about to ask a question, the silky, solid-colored blouse as she prefers buttoned high, and yet the spaces between those buttons.

31:36.491 --> 31:46.284
When she leaned into the verge of a question, the bright flashes of creamy sand detonated deep in the primal recesses of morning, unsettling in the heavy earth of convention and decorum.

31:46.805 --> 31:47.746
I wanted to touch her.

31:48.087 --> 31:51.491
I wanted to cross the room, fall on my knees, and lay my head on her thigh.

31:52.212 --> 31:54.115
I was careful, though, to keep my desires hidden.

31:54.854 --> 31:58.699
My every expression and gesture was a model of professionalism.

31:58.719 --> 31:59.801
I knew what she was thinking.

32:00.021 --> 32:03.365
I could see the dance of desire deep in the dark of her eyes.

32:03.385 --> 32:04.226
But I couldn't act.

32:04.647 --> 32:08.072
I couldn't speak as long as I entertained even the smallest measure of doubt.

32:08.472 --> 32:10.395
The risk was too high.

32:10.415 --> 32:11.356
I had to be sure.

32:13.539 --> 32:15.762
I thought, this is the moment.

32:15.782 --> 32:16.643
Now is the time.

32:17.281 --> 32:24.529
As she settled into her chair, I looked at her meaningfully and closed my office door slowly, signaling my intentions.

32:24.549 --> 32:28.433
Her lips came together in what I'm almost sure was a smile.

32:28.453 --> 32:32.297
I pulled my chair out from under my desk and placed it directly in front of her.

32:32.317 --> 32:34.439
When I took my seat, we were needed in.

32:34.459 --> 32:39.164
Suddenly, her eyes were firing as if the heat of passion were burning through its inner restraints.

32:39.884 --> 32:41.786
Still, no words came.

32:41.806 --> 32:42.387
We were mute.

32:42.948 --> 32:46.191
I looked hungrily over her body while in my eyes to speak formally.

32:46.863 --> 32:48.666
She seemed to want to say something.

32:48.686 --> 32:50.289
Her face was red with desire.

32:50.910 --> 32:57.101
Her hand shot out quickly toward the desk, and I could see she was reaching for the bar from our riverside chimney.

32:57.281 --> 33:03.111
And it occurred to me that there was perhaps some passage from the place she thought spoke to our situation.

33:03.472 --> 33:06.217
The book seemed literally to fly from the desk.

33:06.738 --> 33:10.845
She rested with both hands and pulled the back of her body with great intensity.

33:10.910 --> 33:12.552
from needing the frugal spirits.

33:12.672 --> 33:15.456
And I remember thinking, I've opened floodgates now.

33:15.476 --> 33:21.204
I remember thinking, this will be an experience in a while.

33:21.305 --> 33:31.038
All right, down to our last act.

33:31.319 --> 33:33.141
And I hadn't come prepared.

33:33.422 --> 33:40.191
I thought when we were having to switch platforms, we might have to have to access the downtime

33:40.660 --> 33:46.008
And I, anticipating that, I had brought along some favorite authors of mine.

33:46.028 --> 33:47.170
I'm going to read from print.

33:47.651 --> 33:57.807
And amongst those I've brought along were, of course, Cervantes, and Joyce, and Calvino, who I think would have been a hypertexter had he had a chance.

33:58.668 --> 34:07.242
And Jorge Luis Borges, whose garden of the Forking Pass has often been

34:07.762 --> 34:10.626
referred to as a kind of program hypertext story.

34:11.167 --> 34:30.958
And it was one that, I think the very first thing I ever saw done in this format was when a then very young, Stuart Malthrop, came through here back in the 80s and attended one of our CHUG meetings and demonstrated his little experimental hyperfiction forking past.

34:30.978 --> 34:35.946
We found it located in our archives and quite make it work.

34:36.280 --> 34:39.164
although it had been our intention to do so.

34:40.245 --> 34:51.659
And then came the moment when, after I got into this stuff and had to do a review of all the extant, I figured in 92 I could still do that.

34:51.760 --> 34:57.447
It was like reviewing all the books in print about three years after Gutenberg's innovation.

34:58.108 --> 35:00.210
Now's the last chance to get at all of them.

35:00.511 --> 35:02.473
So I did the whole lot.

35:02.808 --> 35:15.526
And I had to settle on one to kind of focus on, and it was such an obvious choice, with Stuart Mawthorpe's Victory Garden, which at that moment was the largest, most complex, and most innovative work in the forum.

35:17.949 --> 35:23.757
By then, shortly after, the internet got invented, or discovered, I guess it was always there.

35:24.458 --> 35:32.089
Almost before Mosaic or Netscape turned up,

35:32.491 --> 35:39.162
And there was Stuart Mulder already out there with his marvelously invented agaroscope.

35:39.242 --> 35:48.257
And in this last forum when we were doing our newest, we were doing one of these hypertexty events down in South Carolina, and I had to get Stuart down.

35:48.337 --> 35:50.420
I assumed we'd be reading from it, but no.

35:50.701 --> 35:59.595
This ceaselessly restless innovator was already out there with a verbal, well, not a verbal project, but a QTVR project called Toon Rockers.

36:00.352 --> 36:07.081
And we got a glimpse, and here we are, yes.

36:08.343 --> 36:17.276
And as soon as we got this program started, Stuart and I helped us design it, and we talked about it while we were down there together.

36:18.337 --> 36:21.421
I assumed this is what we'd be looking at tonight.

36:21.441 --> 36:22.603
Of course we would be.

36:23.304 --> 36:26.368
And no, no, something new, Stuart said.

36:26.609 --> 36:28.992
So did you get a glimpse of the

36:30.119 --> 36:32.581
virtual reality experience, did you move around a bit?

36:32.601 --> 36:33.202
Right.

36:33.302 --> 36:34.883
So, here he is.

36:35.043 --> 36:43.651
Let's turn it over.

36:43.671 --> 36:49.236
They make you turn these things off on the airplane, so I don't know what it'll do with the microphone.

36:49.256 --> 36:50.257
This is where my notes are.

36:53.160 --> 36:54.161
Yeah, new.

36:55.542 --> 36:57.123
There may be a joke there.

36:57.624 --> 36:58.084
We'll see.

36:58.638 --> 37:06.489
It was a lot easier, obviously, to be the last act in 1992 when there were only three or four acts.

37:07.330 --> 37:12.677
It's impossible to follow what you saw tonight, especially to follow Ed.

37:13.198 --> 37:16.062
Apologies in advance.

37:16.202 --> 37:17.804
This thing is called Reagan Library.

37:18.926 --> 37:20.568
I'm not quite sure why.

37:20.588 --> 37:24.073
I could say there's no simple way to say this.

37:24.493 --> 37:27.177
I could say, what if the word will not be still?

37:27.865 --> 37:41.645
I could say hypertext will produce, at best, mist as reinvented by Alain Brodrier, but closer to the truth is I don't remember, which is the title, I guess.

37:42.146 --> 37:47.033
I don't really remember what I remember.

37:47.053 --> 37:50.798
And you've already seen the best gag, so I probably ought to quit while I'm ahead.

37:51.319 --> 37:55.264
But anyway, we'll look at a little bit of this.

37:57.748 --> 37:57.788
B.

37:58.190 --> 38:09.781
The confession behind this is that it takes months of your life to build these little worlds, made strenuously, and once you build one, why don't you keep using it?

38:10.722 --> 38:12.364
This one's a little bit different.

38:13.385 --> 38:23.775
There is a graphical space at the top of each of these pages, and as Bobby was showing you, you can be almost sickeningly

38:24.430 --> 38:29.217
rotated, and various things will appear out of the mist.

38:30.780 --> 38:42.157
And there's also text that goes with these depictions, not to put too fine a point on it or make too great a claim.

38:42.938 --> 38:46.564
The texts are intended to be coordinated with what you are seeing.

38:46.664 --> 38:52.733
They are, in some cases, what a character speaking these lines is seeing under some circumstance or other, or they're

38:53.118 --> 38:55.481
worlds that may be apparent to them in some way.

38:55.962 --> 38:56.843
So I'll start with this one.

38:57.905 --> 39:00.328
Good morning, Dr. Chandra, Dr. Ramchandra.

39:00.829 --> 39:05.696
The patient attempts a bunny, which makes 22 times in the past half hour.

39:05.756 --> 39:06.817
Trust my count over yours.

39:06.897 --> 39:07.759
I'm the specialist here.

39:08.359 --> 39:09.181
Please disregard.

39:09.521 --> 39:10.783
It's not what you think.

39:10.803 --> 39:11.924
It's not what you think.

39:12.225 --> 39:13.086
Why don't you sleep on it?

39:13.346 --> 39:15.089
My stack overflows with joy.

39:15.750 --> 39:17.072
Center, okay, center.

39:17.092 --> 39:18.794
The center is the place with the pillars.

39:19.415 --> 39:23.040
Can't say as I'm thrilled with the color scheme, but it seems there's only myself to blame.

39:23.510 --> 39:25.913
I can see a few things, though it's generally hazy.

39:26.374 --> 39:28.797
It actually has since me beat root.

39:28.817 --> 39:33.683
17% of readers believe these messages.

39:33.703 --> 39:36.947
To move around in here, there should be links.

39:36.967 --> 39:39.471
I'm not saying that may be a bad sign.

39:40.572 --> 39:47.942
But there is an assured way to move, and that is to pick an object, which will reset our point of view somewhere else in this world.

39:48.002 --> 39:50.024
You can see this object is now coming to view.

39:50.285 --> 39:52.167
We can now see another object behind it.

39:52.484 --> 39:53.105
beyond it.

39:53.625 --> 39:57.508
And we can, in fact, see where we were.

39:57.528 --> 39:59.910
And there are some other objects in the world here.

40:00.651 --> 40:01.412
All are visitable.

40:02.873 --> 40:04.454
Not all are necessarily significant.

40:05.135 --> 40:07.877
We have a little bit of text from this point on the map.

40:08.558 --> 40:10.079
I can't see myself in this.

40:10.199 --> 40:10.620
Can you?

40:10.980 --> 40:12.261
Not that it's a problem, really.

40:12.641 --> 40:21.529
The pumps of the things that are falling into some sleeping giant duvet in group of lithium rotifer sodium silicate

40:22.167 --> 40:23.328
That's the trouble with metaphor.

40:23.348 --> 40:24.409
It ends up in confusion.

40:24.790 --> 40:25.751
Come back to the beach.

40:26.311 --> 40:27.673
The clerk will call the roll.

40:27.913 --> 40:37.243
Your identical cousins, Francis Xavier Bushman, Dennis Pendennis, Mrs. Leonard Nimoy, Bunny Hoppenbach, Joe Liver, Llewellyn N. Wellington.

40:38.384 --> 40:41.767
You may have noticed these little dots that keep appearing at the bottom of things.

40:41.807 --> 40:44.210
They are not insignificance.

40:44.230 --> 40:46.612
In fact, I'll have something to say about them before we're done.

40:46.893 --> 40:51.077
I'm going to go back where we came from, which is to the pavilion.

40:53.285 --> 40:55.869
And again, this is the view we initially saw.

40:57.171 --> 41:01.437
And you'll see that we're sort of in the same place, but not exactly.

41:01.758 --> 41:02.879
Good morning, Dr. Chandra.

41:02.919 --> 41:03.861
Dr. Ramchandra.

41:03.881 --> 41:04.241
Whee!

41:04.301 --> 41:05.503
Another one got past you.

41:05.523 --> 41:08.427
Patient attempts at funny, which makes 22 times in the past half hour.

41:08.487 --> 41:09.489
Trust my account over yours.

41:09.870 --> 41:10.711
I'm a specialist here.

41:11.091 --> 41:11.772
You won't get it.

41:12.333 --> 41:14.957
Excuse me, but have you considered the angle of your repose?

41:15.338 --> 41:16.860
Ceaselessly improving the void.

41:17.160 --> 41:18.542
This is not a game.

41:18.823 --> 41:19.604
You won't get it.

41:20.165 --> 41:20.585
Center.

41:20.605 --> 41:21.346
Okay, center.

41:21.387 --> 41:23.089
The center is the place with the pillars.

41:23.508 --> 41:26.993
and says I'm thrilled with the color scheme, but it seems there's only myself to blame.

41:27.414 --> 41:30.999
I can see a few things, though it's generally hazy, and actually that suits me.

41:31.360 --> 41:31.940
Sheep shame.

41:32.241 --> 41:37.569
Had this been a virtual emergency, and now a word from our database, links considered harmful.

41:37.609 --> 41:40.233
On the 1 to 10, let's make this 3.8.

41:41.695 --> 41:46.182
You may have glommed on to the fact that something's going on with the language.

41:47.544 --> 41:50.528
You may not care, but I do.

41:50.862 --> 41:57.390
And what's going on with the language is that if you revisit these places, certain bits of the text will change.

41:58.872 --> 42:04.378
You'll also acquire more dots along the way, signals that you have in here before, breadcrumbs.

42:05.680 --> 42:12.048
And what happens is that there are bits of each textual space that are randomly generated.

42:12.288 --> 42:18.135
There's a very unclever random text generator, which nonetheless, I mean, this is the great secret of random text.

42:18.470 --> 42:28.839
You can assemble really stupid things in very crude ways, and they sort of come off already if you don't take yourself very seriously.

42:28.859 --> 42:31.201
And that's more or less what's happening.

42:31.221 --> 42:43.411
Now, that leads to a number of possibilities for this task, most important, which being that this is a terminal hypertext, or I should say terminal hypertext.

42:43.532 --> 42:45.393
There is an end to this.

42:45.413 --> 42:47.515
It is possible to go through all the spaces

42:47.798 --> 42:51.504
rack up the maximum number of bread crumbs, and see all that into the sea.

42:52.005 --> 42:54.870
And it'll be over, over, a key theme.

42:55.691 --> 42:56.292
But not yet.

42:56.793 --> 42:57.394
We're getting there.

42:58.275 --> 43:01.901
I just did want to show you that there is, in fact, more world to this world.

43:03.323 --> 43:11.697
By revisiting, for the first time, one of the key points in the first state of the world, a sort of green state,

43:11.930 --> 43:17.717
We're able to fly to another one, the blue state, where we have actually a different set of objects.

43:17.737 --> 43:19.900
As you can see, there's the familiar pavilion.

43:19.920 --> 43:25.426
And in fact, here's the object that we flew out to, which is this sort of marble stairs thing.

43:26.688 --> 43:31.233
And there are other objects visible around in this version of the world.

43:32.094 --> 43:32.775
Were you dreaming?

43:33.155 --> 43:36.840
You were dreaming in the sun, I imagine, the way we used to do before we lost the light.

43:37.260 --> 43:38.842
My staff overflows with joy.

43:39.343 --> 43:40.384
It's not what you think.

43:40.533 --> 43:41.494
Let us demonstrate.

43:41.514 --> 43:42.916
Did you say ghostly now?

43:43.417 --> 43:44.578
What do you think you're reading?

43:45.159 --> 43:56.233
When God spoke to me, it was always in landscape dreams, interfering with a digital instrument, the size of the state of Nebraska, interfering with a digital instrument, the monorail.

43:57.915 --> 44:09.409
And if we fly back to Pavilion, we'll come in on the opening of this one, which is possibly where we'll end this one.

44:10.570 --> 44:11.731
I, Emily St.

44:11.751 --> 44:16.015
Cloud, bequeathed to certain of the ways my garden of first-class objects.

44:16.035 --> 44:18.017
What does the president know, and how does he know it?

44:18.277 --> 44:19.779
Boop me up and call me Ryder.

44:20.019 --> 44:21.040
Buy more memory.

44:21.680 --> 44:23.042
Now you see them.

44:23.062 --> 44:25.304
Blue, green, and gold laid out on the big wheels.

44:25.484 --> 44:27.446
This world has a basic circularity.

44:27.906 --> 44:29.148
Return immediately to Senator.

44:29.248 --> 44:32.130
Meanwhile, aboard USS Divergent in 10 units.

44:32.471 --> 44:34.893
Elsewhere in the universe, this is the world I made.

44:35.253 --> 44:36.515
A garden of remembering.

44:37.375 --> 44:39.177
Oh, this is one more place to come back, the pavilion.

44:40.253 --> 44:44.118
No, I won't because we've gone to another state now.

44:44.138 --> 44:44.599
It happens.

44:45.720 --> 44:47.623
It was aliens, I tell you, aliens.

44:47.643 --> 44:48.183
I'm space.

44:48.264 --> 44:48.904
It had to be.

44:49.425 --> 44:50.086
And another thing.

44:50.547 --> 44:52.229
404 errors and counting.

44:52.349 --> 44:55.233
Can the dog eat it?

44:55.894 --> 44:57.035
There is no cause for alarm.

44:57.916 --> 45:01.281
Loads from nitrogen breathers and sequined suits from planet Hollywood.

45:01.301 --> 45:05.646
They descended on the light truck in which I was riding somewhere between Saratoga and Los Gatos.

45:05.666 --> 45:07.469
404 errors and counting.

45:08.110 --> 45:09.131
Not those fragments.

45:09.151 --> 45:09.872
These fragments.

45:10.325 --> 45:14.950
The pearlescent outlines of their incredible craft winted cynically in the late summer sun.

45:15.331 --> 45:20.997
They fixed us in an unlicensed tractor beam and drew us straight up into the throbbing interior of the ship.

45:21.617 --> 45:22.999
I will say that again in Australian.

45:23.880 --> 45:25.442
You are not following instructions.

45:25.502 --> 45:27.224
You are not following instructions.

45:27.364 --> 45:28.545
What do these words say?

45:28.585 --> 45:29.646
Don't touch that dial.

45:30.767 --> 45:32.189
I'll try to find my way back to the pavilion.

45:32.209 --> 45:35.012
This is a very dark world, as you may notice.

45:35.553 --> 45:36.614
And you should try it in windows.

45:36.694 --> 45:39.437
It's so dark you can't see anything.

45:40.160 --> 45:43.824
I've lost the pavilion.

45:43.844 --> 45:44.565
We'll never get home.

45:45.746 --> 45:48.329
The prisoner will approach the sinister black monitor.

45:48.349 --> 45:49.350
What does this mean?

45:50.571 --> 45:54.075
Where are the dancers, the commuters, the crowds of fishermen and jugglers?

45:54.596 --> 45:55.817
Did you say go to sleep now?

45:56.138 --> 45:57.599
How long have we been there yet?

45:58.160 --> 45:59.321
Read this carefully.

45:59.902 --> 46:02.204
The deal was sealed long ago, even before you knew.

46:02.244 --> 46:04.927
The sad, eager doorman proceeds with caution.

46:04.947 --> 46:06.049
No help is available.

46:06.509 --> 46:07.810
What can you remember?

46:07.830 --> 46:10.133
Had this been a virtual emergency, you would have been.

46:10.349 --> 46:12.332
You are not following instructions.

46:12.352 --> 46:14.735
And now you can't escape the signature of your destiny.

46:14.776 --> 46:18.621
See, there are no statues of invitation for crimes against the humanities.

46:19.262 --> 46:21.946
The black marks on your record jog at all your memory.

46:22.166 --> 46:23.588
But can the dog eat it?

46:23.929 --> 46:26.433
Semolina probability of closure now 124%.

46:27.735 --> 46:31.480
That's a message.

46:41.298 --> 46:59.724
We're going to be gathering tomorrow morning in the MML panel lounge for a symposium talking about all this material, especially on those who are here as participants and getting engaged in the dialogue about which we've been talking all night.

47:00.164 --> 47:06.293
Tomorrow afternoon there's a very important demo by some of the developers here.

47:06.813 --> 47:12.819
showing us some of the software of the future, well, in the present, and with intimations of the future anyway.

47:12.839 --> 47:17.564
That's going to be over in Macmillan 117, the kind of auditorium that we should have had for our show tonight.

47:18.064 --> 47:20.747
Brand new building, brand new auditorium, terrific space.

47:20.767 --> 47:27.854
That's the building in the corner there at George, with demos to follow, and then a final gathering on Friday morning.

47:27.874 --> 47:31.598
So to see most of all of you at the events to follow.

47:31.658 --> 47:32.078
Thank you very much.
